LEFT is off\u2011board.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Opponent\u2019s possible heads:** (3,5), (3,3), (2,4), (4,4). None of our three safe squares clash with those, so any of them keeps us alive this turn.  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Apple proximity & future freedom**  \n- **UP** lands us right under the juicy apple at (1,6) and only two steps away from the high\u2011up apple line (0,8). We keep three open directions for the next turn (up, down, right).  \n- **DOWN** would drop us onto (0,4), putting us in line for the apple at (1,4). But the opponent can sprint left \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 (1,4) **same turn**, risking a deadly head\u2011on collision when we both try to eat it.  \n- **RIGHT** (1,5) also eyes (1,4) and (1,6), but it pushes us deeper into the middle of the board where the opponent can more easily corner us later.  \n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Safety vs aggression:** Right now our score is 0\u20110, so a safe, position\u2011building move beats a risky race for (1,4). Going **UP** gives us a clear path to a guaranteed apple in two moves **without** courting a collision.\n\n**\ud83d\udd2e Short\u2011term plan**  \n- Turn\u202f1: move **UP** to (0,6).  \n- Turn\u202f2: head **RIGHT** to (1,6) and grab the apple.  \n- Meanwhile keep an eye on the opponent\u2019s drift left\u2011ward; if he heads toward our column we can swing up and box him against the top wall.\n\nLet\u2019s stay alive, stay flexible, and start stacking points!  \n\nUP",

No chance they\u2019ll crash into (0,\u202f0) this turn.\n\n**Strategy:** Grab the apple now, lock in the extra point, then we\u2019ll be forced to swing right on the next turn \u2013 exactly the kind of controlled freedom we want. It also keeps us away from the opponent\u2019s corridor and maintains a clear path along the bottom row.\n\nSo the smart, aggressive, point\u2011gaining move is:\n\nDOWN",

Every extra apple narrows the gap and adds length, turning my body into a moving wall for the rival.  \n- By sprinting rightward I\u2019ll collect three apples in three moves, jump ahead in the score race, and create a massive \u201cwall\u201d that the opponent must navigate around.\n\n**\u2705 Decision:** The safest, most rewarding, and most aggressive move is **RIGHT**.  \n\nRIGHT",

The opponent will avoid a mutual KO, so they\u2019ll most likely go **UP** or **RIGHT**, not down into my lane.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Why going DOWN wins the round**\n\n1. **Instant fruit** \u2013 (2,4) is an apple, so I grow and extend my lead to 21.  \n2. **Safety** \u2013 No enemy can reach (2,4) this turn; it\u2019s a dead\u2011clear spot.  \n3. **Space claim** \u2013 Dropping into the lower\u2011left corridor locks the opponent above the wall while I snake through the open lower half.  \n4. **Future freedom** \u2013 After eating, I can swing right along row\u202f4, scoop the apples at (5,5) and (7,3), and still keep a wide escape corridor.\n\n**\ud83d\udcc8 Short\u2011term game plan**\n\n- **Turn\u202f+1:** **DOWN** to (2,4) \u2192 eat apple, grow.  \n- **Turn\u202f+2:** **RIGHT** to (3,4) \u2192 keep moving toward the apple cluster at (5,5).  \n- **Turn\u202f+3:** **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,4) then **UP** \u2192 (4,5) \u2026 sweeping the middle board while the opponent wrestles with the top wall.  \n- Keep the lead, force the rival into a tight corner, and pounce when he runs out of moves.\n\nSo the decisive, apple\u2011filled, aggression\u2011filled move is\u2026  \n\n**DOWN**",

Since I\u2019m ahead 2 apples, a double KO still hands me the win.\n\n**\u2694\ufe0f Tactical Thought**\n\n- **UP** gives me the most flexibility: I can keep moving up the central corridor or swing right into the juicy apple at (5,\u202f5).  \n- It also positions me to force that simultaneous head\u2011on if the rival heads down, turning my score advantage into a victory.  \n- **RIGHT** is tempting for the apple, but it leaves me with only one safe direction next turn, increasing the risk of being trapped or forced into a bad trade\u2011off.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Short\u2011term Plan**\n\n1. **Turn\u202f+1** \u2013 **UP** to (4,\u202f5).  \n2. Watch the rival:  \n   - If he goes **DOWN** to (5,\u202f6), I\u2019ll answer with **RIGHT** to (5,\u202f5) next turn, triggering a head\u2011on at the apple.  \n   - If he goes **RIGHT** or stays elsewhere, I\u2019ll keep the pressure by moving **UP** or taking the apple on the right later.\n\n**\ud83d\udcc8 Long\u2011term Goal**\n\n- Keep the central column open as a moving wall, herd the opponent toward the top\u2011left edge, and repeatedly look for head\u2011on opportunities where my apple lead guarantees a win.\n\n**MOVE**  \nUP",

It also keeps at least one safe direction open, whereas UP leaves me with only a single corridor.\n\n**\ud83d\udca1 Short\u2011term plan**\n\n1. **Turn\u202f+0** \u2013 Move **RIGHT** onto (5,\u202f5).  \n2. If the opponent dives **DOWN** \u2192 we both die \u2192 I win on apples.  \n3. If they dodge (go LEFT or RIGHT) \u2192 I\u2019ll follow up with **UP** or **DOWN** to chase a head\u2011on on the next tick.  \n\nLet\u2019s lock it in and turn this board into a battlefield!  \n\n**MOVE**  \nRIGHT",
