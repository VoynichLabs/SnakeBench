It increases distance from the enemy head and moves me closer to the west-side apples at (0,2) and (0,7).\n\nShort plan for the next few turns:\n- Move LEFT now to (4,1) to open routes west.\n- From there, head toward the (0,2)/(0,7) cluster while avoiding entering narrow corridors near the enemy.

LEFT would hit my neck at (5,8).\n- Apples are at (6,5), (5,7), (8,9), (3,6), (0,4). The nearest reachable target that remains accessible is toward the apple cluster around (8,9); moving RIGHT keeps a clear path toward that apple and preserves flexibility for subsequent turns.\n\nConclusion:\n- Choose RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

That increases my lead and continues the chain of nearby apples.\n- After eating (2,6), plan to route downward toward the cluster of low apples (e.g., (1,2), (0,1), (0,4)), while avoiding the enemy\u2019s top-edge body. Keep lateral escape options open and avoid getting boxed by the long enemy body along the top rows.\n\nLEFT",

The nearest contested apple (6,7) is close to the enemy\u2019s top-body and risky to contest.\n- Moving LEFT to (1,6) nudges me toward the cluster (1,2), (0,1), (0,4) while staying out of the enemy\u2019s top-row trap. From (1,6) I will have multiple safe follow-up moves (down toward the low apples or left toward x=0).\n- DOWN is also safe, but LEFT is marginally better because it aligns my x with the lower-left apples sooner and avoids climbing into the enemy\u2019s upper area.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- After LEFT, head down toward (1,2) and then collect (0,1) and (0,4) as available.\n- Avoid moving into y\u22657 unless the enemy clears that area; keep lateral escape routes open to prevent being boxed by the long enemy body.\n\nLEFT",

DOWN moves me toward (1,2) (distance 4) without pushing me against the board edge. UP risks entering the enemy\u2019s crowded top area. LEFT is viable for x=0 apples but sacrifices a degree of maneuverability.\n- No immediate collisions are apparent with opponents for the DOWN move \u2014 enemy head is far enough that a head-on here is unlikely this turn.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Continue down the column to pick up (1,2).

Apples on the board are currently not reachable without risking death this turn.\n\nLong-term plan note: With more turns, aim to avoid tight loops near the edge, seek apples like (6,7) or (3,7) while watching enemy #0\u2019s path to prevent head-on collisions; consider detouring toward open space to keep options for survival and growth.\n\nUP",

It avoids the confinement risks of going down and keeps options to pivot toward left-side apples later (0,1 / 2,0) if needed.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Move UP now to stay flexible and advance toward the apple cluster up-top.\n- From (5,2) aim to route safely around my own body toward (6,7) or (3,7), while monitoring enemy movements on the right; if the enemy converges, pivot left/down to secure isolated apples (2,0 or 0,1).\n- Avoid hugging the bottom edge and avoid moves that follow into tight loops around my own body segments.\n\nUP",
