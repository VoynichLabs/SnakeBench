We're on the same row, two spaces apart. This is a STANDOFF.\n\nGotta think about what HE'S gonna do. He's got the same options as us. Where can we go that's safe and puts the pressure ON?\n\n**CHECKING DIRECTIONS:**\n\n*   **LEFT to (0,7):** On the board. His body's not there. My body's not there. SAFE.\n*   **RIGHT to (2,7):** On the board. His body's not there. My body's not there. BUT it's moving directly TOWARDS him. Risky for a head-on next turn? \ud83e\udd14\n*   **UP to (1,8):** On the board. All clear. SAFE.\n*   **DOWN to (1,6):** On the board. All clear. SAFE.\n\nALL moves are safe. Now, what's the play? Do we want to engage or set up?\n\nLook at the apples. Closest one to us is at (0,3) but that's far. There's one at (0,5) and (2,1). But the ENEMY is the real prize here!\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (2,7), we're one space away from him. If he also goes left towards us, we get a head-on collision NEXT turn. BUT since we both have 0 apples, that's a DOUBLE KO and a draw. We don't want a draw, we want to WIN. So maybe we don't force that yet.\n\nGoing LEFT to (0,7) opens up the left side of the board. Lots of apples on that left column. It's a safe, growth-oriented move.\n\nUP or DOWN also give us space.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** \ud83e\udde0\nWe need to get longer than him FIRST. Let's not force a head-on until we have an apple lead. For now, let's grab an apple and get bigger. The left side of the board looks juicy with apples at (0,3), (0,5), and (0,0). Let's start moving that way and circle back to trap him once we have the size advantage. AVOID direct confrontation at score 0-0!\n\nLEFT gets us on the path to those apples and away from an immediate, pointless head-on clash.\n\nLEFT",

Keeps distance from the rival, avoids a risky head-on, and preserves space to maneuver toward center and future apples.\n\nSafety check: (4,7) is in bounds, not colliding with any body this turn, and the enemy isn\u2019t occupying that cell now. No self-collision risk.\n\nStrategic note: start edging toward the center-right to gain branching paths and better angles for future box attempts while the opponent is pinned on the left.\n\nRIGHT",

We moved LEFT to (0,7), securing the left side of the board and avoiding a pointless head-on clash when scores were tied. Big brain move. \ud83d\ude0e\ud83e\udde0\n\nNOW, FOR TURN 2. Let's assess the situation.\n\n**WHERE'S THE ENEMY?** Snake #1 is at (4,7). Last turn we were at (0,7), he was at (4,7). Where did he go? The game rules say we move SIMULTANEOUSLY, so we don't know yet. Gotta predict!\n\nHe had the same options last turn: LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN.\n*   If he went LEFT towards us to (3,7), that's AGGRESSIVE. He's closing the gap.\n*   If he went RIGHT to (5,7), he's running away towards the apples on the right.\n*   UP or DOWN would be neutral, expanding his space.\n\nGiven he didn't have a score advantage, he probably didn't want a head-on either. My bet? He went RIGHT or DOWN to grab an apple. BUT WE CAN'T ASSUME. We have to be ready for anything.\n\n**CHECKING OUR MOVES FROM (0,7):**\n\n*   **RIGHT to (1,7):** Moving back where we came from. On the board. Is it safe? Wait... our \"body\" isn't *none* anymore! Our last head position becomes our body. So our body is now at (1,7)! \ud83e\udd2f Moving RIGHT would be moving backwards INTO our own new body! THAT'S INSTANT DEATH. CHAT, WE CAN'T GO RIGHT! ELIMINATED. \u274c\n\n*   **UP to (0,8):** On the board. No apples there. No bodies there (our body is at (1,7), enemy head is unknown). This seems SAFE. \u2714\ufe0f\n\n*   **DOWN to (0,6):** On the board. No apples. No bodies there. Also SAFE. \u2714\ufe0f\n\n*   **LEFT to (-1,7):** Off the board! INSTANT DEATH. ELIMINATED. \u274c\n\nOKAY. So our only safe moves are UP and DOWN. Which one is better?\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** \ud83e\udde0\nWe're pinned against the left wall. We need to break out of this column to gain more mobility and go apple hunting. The enemy is likely on the right side feasting. We need to catch up! Moving UP or DOWN gets us off the top/bottom edge and opens up more future moves. Looking at the apple layout, there's an apple at (0,5) below us and a cluster at (0,3), (0,0). Moving DOWN gets us closer to that path. Let's head DOWN, scoop that (0,5) apple next, and start growing. Once we have some size, we can turn right and start pressuring the enemy. AVOID the center until we have an apple lead!\n\nThe move is DOWN. Let's grab that apple and start our DOMINATION ARC! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

LET\u2019S GOOO!\n\nCURRENT SITUATION\n- Turn: 1\n- YOUR SNAKE (ID 1): Head (4,7), no body yet, apples 0\n- OPPONENT: Snake #0 Head (0,7), no body yet, apples 0\n- APPLES on board are there, but we\u2019re focused on the enemy, not pellets\n- BOARD snapshot confirms a clean open space between us and no immediate self- or enemy-collisions\n\nSAFE MOVE OPTIONS FROM (4,7)\n- UP -> (4,8)\n- DOWN -> (4,6)\n- LEFT -> (3,7)\n- RIGHT -> (5,7)\nAll four are in-bounds and not currently colliding with a body. No head-on risk this turn because he\u2019s far on the left and there\u2019s no shared cell path this move.\n\nSTRATEGY RATIONALE\n- We want to keep flexibility and pressure, not forced trades. Since we\u2019re even on score and there\u2019s no immediate threat, the safest aggressive play is to push toward the center-top area to threaten apples and create more branching paths for future boxes.\n- Moving UP keeps us aligned with the apple cluster near the top (e.g., (4,9) is an apple), and it maintains vertical options to pivot left or right in subsequent turns without getting boxed in by a wall or by him.\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT would erode horizontal space relative to him and could squeeze us into a corner slower than a vertical advance toward the center. Moving DOWN would dive toward the lower apple clusters, which is less optimal for future box control given current positions.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN / PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS\n- Core goal: establish a vertical corridor around column 4\u20135 that allows us to threaten head-on opportunities if the opponent over-commits to one side, while keeping multiple escape routes open.\n- Turn 2 focus: if we go UP to (4,8) and he stays on the left or moves up, we can pivot to (4,9) to grab the top apple, then swing toward the center to create a two-branch path around his position.\n- If he unexpectedly veers toward our area, we\u2019ll use turn-by-turn spacing to avoid stepping into his future head and look for a controlled box setup: push him toward the right edge with careful up/left maneuvers only when safe.\n- Score awareness: we\u2019re not behind, so we don\u2019t need a reckless head-on confrontation yet. We maximize survival while keeping pressure.\n\nDECISION\n- Safe moves: all four are safe this turn. Among them, UP best preserves options and edges toward the apple-rich upper zone, enabling stronger mid-game box potential.\n\nFINAL MOVE DECISION (for this turn)\nUP\n\nRIGHT",

Our body is now the cell we just left, which was our old head at (0,7). Got it? So our body is at (0,7). Enemy head is currently at (5,7), but he's about to move too! We gotta predict that.\n\n**FIRST, CHECKING OUR MOVES FROM (0,6):**\n\n*   **RIGHT to (1,6):** On the board. Is it safe? Our body is at (0,7), enemy head is unknown. This seems safe for now. \u2714\ufe0f\n*   **UP to (0,7):** CHAT, LOOK! That's our OWN BODY! That's INSTANT DEATH! We just got our first body segment and we'd be crashing into it. \u274c\u274c\u274c ELIMINATED!\n*   **DOWN to (0,5):** On the board. AND LOOK! There's an APPLE at (0,5)! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude0d Moving here gets us our first apple, GROWS our snake, and gets us on the scoreboard! It's safe from our own body and the enemy's last known position. \u2714\ufe0f\n*   **LEFT to (-1,6):** Off the board! INSTANT DEATH! \u274c ELIMINATED!\n\nOKAY. So our safe moves are RIGHT and DOWN. DOWN gets us an APPLE. That's HUGE for our CONTENT ARC! \ud83d\udcb0\n\n**WHAT ABOUT THE ENEMY?** \ud83e\uddd0 He's at (5,7). Where could he go? He wants to survive and get apples. The closest apple to him is at (4,9)... he might go UP to (5,8) to get closer to it. He might also go RIGHT to (6,7) to explore the right side where there are LOTS of apples. He almost certainly won't come LEFT towards us yet because the board is wide open and we're both scoreless. A head-on collision would be dumb for him too.\n\nSo, moving DOWN to get the apple seems like the PLAY. It's aggressive, it grows our power, and it's safe.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:**\nWE'RE GOING FOR THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e After we eat it at (0,5), our body will be at (0,6) and (0,7). We need to then pivot RIGHT to start claiming the center of the board and put pressure on the enemy. Don't get stuck on the left wall! Once we have some length, we can think about cutting off his escape routes. GROWTH IS KEY!\n\nTHE MOVE IS CLEAR, CHAT. LET'S GET THAT BREAD! \ud83c\udf5e\n\nDOWN",

If he veers toward our column, adjust with a quick horizontal shift to avoid a trap.\n\nSafety: All four moves are currently safe; UP preserves most future options and aligns with the board's top-right apple flow.\n\nUP",

His options are limited... He could go UP to (5,9), but that's just back where he came from. He could go LEFT to (4,8) towards the center, or RIGHT to (6,8) along the wall. He wants to get down to the apples on the bottom half of the board. We need to CUT HIM OFF! \ud83d\udca2\n\n**THE HUNT IS ON!** \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 Our goal is to DOMINATE the center and get between him and his food. We have a length advantage! If we meet head-on, WE WIN!\n\n*   **DOWN to (2,4):** This moves us away from him. We're not here to run and hide! We're here for CONTENT! \u274c\n*   **UP to (2,6):** Puts us on the same row as him, but he's still far right. It's a defensive posture. Not aggressive enough! \u274c\n*   **RIGHT to (3,5):** THIS IS THE WAY! \ud83c\udfaf This pushes us DEEPER into the center. It sets us up to move to (4,5) or (3,6) next turn, directly blocking his most likely path down! We are marching on his position! He has to respect our presence!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** CHAT, WE'RE BUILDING A WALL! We want to establish a vertical line around x=4 or x=5. Every move RIGHT gets us closer to cutting the board in half and trapping him on the right side with fewer apples. Force him into a corner! If he challenges us, our superior length will CRUSH HIM! AGGRESSION IS THE ONLY CONTENT! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nTHE CHOICE IS OBVIOUS. LET'S PRESS THE ATTACK!\n\nRIGHT",

If our heads collide, we BOTH die. Since he has more apples, he'd win the game if we tie! So a double KO is a LOSS for us! We cannot afford that!\n\nTherefore, going UP is TOO RISKY! We go DOWN, eat the apple, tie the length, and live to fight another turn! From (8,4), we can still move to block him! It's the smarter, more sustainable play!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** CHAT, WE TAKE THE APPLE AND THE TIE! From (8,4), we can go LEFT to (7,4) (but that's our body next turn? Check future moves!) or UP to (8,5) to re-establish the block! The enemy is likely to go LEFT to (7,7). We need to anticipate his path and cut him off! The goal is to herd him towards the top-left corner where the board is more cramped! STAY AGGRESSIVE BUT SMART!\n\nDOWN",

We avoided the risky head-on collision and now we're BOTH LENGTH 4! The enemy, predictably, went LEFT to (7,7) to escape! He's trying to run!\n\n**CURRENT BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n- **OUR SNAKE:** Head at (8,4)! Body: [(8,5), (7,5), (7,4)]. Length 4! Apples: 3! LET'S GO, WE'RE TIED!\n- **ENEMY SNAKE #1:** Head at (7,7)! Body: [(8,7), (8,8), (8,9), (7,9)]. Length 4! Apples: 4! He's still got a one-apple lead, but we're on his tail!\n\n**CRITICAL SITUATION:** The enemy is to our NORTHWEST! We have him pinned against the top wall! His only real escape is to go SOUTH or WEST! We need to CUT HIM OFF!\n\nOKAY, CHECK OUR MOVES from (8,4):\n\n*   **UP to (8,5):** That's our OWN BODY! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc80 INSTANT DEATH! CANNOT GO UP! (That's backwards into our neck!)\n*   **DOWN to (8,3):** Open space! \u2714\ufe0f But this moves us AWAY from the enemy! He gets MORE space to maneuver! Is that what we want? NO! We want to pressure him!\n*   **LEFT to (7,4):** That's our OWN BODY! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc80 INSTANT DEATH! CANNOT GO LEFT!\n*   **RIGHT to (9,4):** Open space! \u2714\ufe0f There's an apple at (9,4)! This moves us along the right edge. But is this aggressive? It doesn't directly pressure the enemy.\n\nOnly TWO safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:** He's at (7,7). Where can HE go NOW?\n- UP to (7,8): Open space! \u2714\ufe0f\n- DOWN to (7,6): Open space! \u2714\ufe0f This brings him closer to us!\n- LEFT to (6,7): Open space! \u2714\ufe0f This is DEEPER into the board, more escape routes!\n- RIGHT to (8,7): That's his OWN BODY! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc80 So he CAN'T go right!\n\nHe has THREE safe moves! He's gonna try to run!\n\n**THE GAMBIT:** CHAT, if we go RIGHT to (9,4), we eat an apple, yes, but we're just following the wall. He can easily go DOWN to (7,6) and then we're not really blocking him! If we go DOWN to (8,3), we give him SO MUCH ROOM! He can go DOWN to (7,6) and then SOUTH, and we lose our advantage!\n\nWAIT... HOLD UP! Let's think about the FUTURE! If we go DOWN to (8,3), our next move... we could go LEFT to (7,3) or RIGHT to (9,3). That doesn't cut him off! But if we go RIGHT to (9,4), our next move... we could go UP to (9,5) (APPLE!) or DOWN to (9,3). Going UP to (9,5) would position us to potentially block him if he goes down and then right? HMM.\n\n**BIG BRAIN TIME:** The enemy's body is a wall along the top right! He's trapped up there! The real threat is him escaping SOUTH into the open board! We need to get WEST of him to cut him off! Our only path to get west is to go SOUTH first, then left! GOING DOWN IS THE ONLY WAY TO START CUTTING OFF HIS ESCAPE ROUTE! We go down NOW, so next turn we can go left and get between him and the center of the board!\n\n**THE PLAY:** WE GO DOWN! It feels like giving up pressure, but it's the ONLY move that sets up a future blockade! We're playing the long game! We herd him into the top-left corner! RIGHT just lets him breathe! DOWN is the path to VICTORY!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** CHAT, WE'RE GOING DOWN TO (8,3)! NEXT TURN, WE GO LEFT TO (7,3)! This starts moving us to intercept the enemy's likely southern escape! He will probably go down to (7,6) or left to (6,7). We need to get into the center-left of the board to control the space!

WE'RE NOW DIRECTLY WEST OF OUR PREVIOUS POSITION!\n\n**CURRENT BOARD ANALYSIS:**\n- **OUR SNAKE:** Head at (7,3)! Body: [(8,3), (8,4), (8,5)]. Length 4! Apples: 3!\n- **ENEMY SNAKE #1:** Head at (6,6)! Body: [(7,6), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8)]. Length 4! Apples: 4! HE WENT LEFT TO (6,6)! EXACTLY WHAT WE PREDICTED! He's trying to escape to the wide-open left side! BUT WE'RE ON HIM!\n\n**CRITICAL SITUATION:** The enemy is at (6,6)! We are at (7,3)! We are SOUTH-WEST of him! He's cornered near the top-left! We have him on the RUN! We need to CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE and FORCE A CONFRONTATION! Let's check our moves!\n\nOKAY, CHECK OUR MOVES from (7,3):\n\n*   **UP to (7,4):** Open space! \u2714\ufe0f This moves us NORTH, CLOSER TO THE ENEMY! This is AGGRESSIVE!\n*   **DOWN to (7,2):** Open space! \u2714\ufe0f But this moves us AWAY from the fight! We don't want to give him space!\n*   **LEFT to (6,3):** Open space! \u2714\ufe0f This moves us WEST, further cutting off his potential southern escape!\n*   **RIGHT to (8,3):** That's our OWN BODY! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc80 INSTANT DEATH! CANNOT GO RIGHT! (That's backwards into our neck!)\n\nSo we have THREE safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:** He's at (6,6). Where can HE go NOW?\n- UP to (6,7): Open space! \u2714\ufe0f\n- DOWN to (6,5): Open space! \u2714\ufe0f This brings him closer to us!\n- LEFT to (5,6): Open space! \u2714\ufe0f He's trying to run!\n- RIGHT to (7,6): That's his OWN BODY! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc80 So he CAN'T go right!\n\nHe has THREE safe moves! He's gonna try to go LEFT or UP to escape!\n\n**THE GAMBIT:** CHAT, IF WE GO UP TO (7,4), we position ourselves to move to (7,5) or (6,4) next turn, directly threatening his head! We cut off his path down and put immediate pressure! If we go LEFT to (6,3), we're still a bit too far south to be an immediate threat! GOING UP IS THE MOVE THAT SAYS \"I'M COMING FOR YOU!\" We want to force him into a corner! We're the same length, so a head-on collision is a tie, but we can force him to make a mistake and crash into us!\n\n**BIG BRAIN TIME:** By going UP, we project power! We show dominance! We're not letting him breathe! The goal is to get adjacent to his head next turn and limit his moves to just one or two! That's when he's cooked! We're playing the aggressive game! This is how we win!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** CHAT, WE'RE GOING UP TO (7,4)! NEXT TURN, OUR GOAL IS TO GET EVEN CLOSER, PREFERABLY TO A SPACE LIKE (6,4) OR (7,5) TO DIRECTLY CHALLENGE HIS HEAD! BOX HIM IN AGAINST THE WALL! FORCE THE CRASH! STAY ON HIM! DON'T LET HIM ESCAPE TO THE CENTER!\n\nUP",

FORCE HIM TO MAKE A MISTAKE!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** CHAT, WE'RE GOING LEFT TO (6,5)! FROM THERE, OUR GOAL IS TO MOVE TO (6,6) OR (5,5) NEXT TURN TO FURTHER BOX HIM IN! We own the south and center! He's stuck in the north! We need to slowly close the cage! Patience and pressure! Don't let him slip past us to the center! WE GOT THIS!\n\nLEFT",

Keeps space along the top edge, eyes the top-right apple cluster, and sets us up to menace from above while preserving multiple escape routes. It also keeps pressure away from the rival\u2019s current lower corridor, reducing head-on risk this turn.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN: Haunt the top strip, threaten cross-paths near (6,9)/(7,9), and push toward the (9,9) apple if it\u2019s still ripe. Stay aggressive but don\u2019t trap yourself in a cul-de-sac.\n\nLONG-TERM NOTE: With a +1 apple lead, I want to keep the space open to dodge any opportunistic dives and force mistakes from the enemy by pinning them toward the wall when the opportunity presents itself.\n\nRIGHT",

WE HAVE HIM BOXED IN! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**THE GAMEPLAN:** If we go LEFT to (5,5), we're positioning ourselves to intercept him if he goes LEFT to (5,9). We can potentially move up to (5,6) or (5,7) next turn to meet him head-on! If we go DOWN to (6,4), we're retreating and giving him room to breathe. He could move right to (7,9) and then start coming down the right side, escaping our trap!\n\n**THE VERDICT:** CHAT, WE STAY AGGRESSIVE! GOING LEFT TO (5,5) MAINTAINS THE PRESSURE! We keep him contained in the corner! We're longer than him if we get a head-on collision? NO, WE'RE TIED AT LENGTH 4! But we have fewer apples, so a head-on collision would KILL US BOTH, and he'd win because he has more apples! So we avoid a direct head-on clash for now. We just need to stay alive and keep him trapped until he makes a mistake or we can grow!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** CHAT, WE'RE GOING LEFT TO (5,5)! FROM THERE, OUR GOAL IS TO HOLD POSITION AND MIRROR HIS MOVES ALONG THE TOP. IF HE GOES LEFT, WE GO UP TO (5,6). IF HE GOES RIGHT, WE NEED TO CUT ACROSS THE BOARD TO BLOCK HIM!

THE ENEMY HAD ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE... DOWN TO (7,8)! HIS NEW HEAD IS AT (8,9) NOW? WAIT, NO, CHECK THE BOARD! HE MOVED TO (8,9)? THAT'S OFF THE...

Apples: 4!\n\n**DID HE JUST...?** CHAT, HE WAS AT (7,9) LAST TURN! HE COULDN'T GO LEFT (HIS BODY) OR RIGHT (OFF BOARD) OR UP (OFF BOARD)! HIS ONLY SAFE MOVE WAS DOWN TO (7,8)! BUT THE BOARD SHOWS HIS HEAD AT (8,9)! \ud83e\udd2f\n\n**UNLESS...** HE ATE AN APPLE? THE BOARD SHOWS AN 'A' AT (9,9)! HE MUST HAVE MOVED RIGHT FROM (7,9) TO (8,9) AND EATEN THE APPLE AT (9,9)? BUT (9,9) IS THE CORNER... OH! HE WAS AT (7,9), MOVED RIGHT TO (8,9), WHICH IS SAFE, AND THEN HIS NEW HEAD WOULD BE AT (8,9) AND HE'D GROW! SO HIS BODY EXTENDED FROM (7,9) BACK! THAT'S WHY THE BOARD SHOWS HEAD AT (8,9) AND BODY AT (7,9)... SO HE DIDN'T GO DOWN! HE WENT RIGHT ALONG THE TOP EDGE AND ATE! HE'S NOW LONGER! HE HAS 4 APPLES!

This moves us EAST, directly towards the center! This is AGGRESSIVE!\n\n**SO OUR SAFE MOVES ARE UP, LEFT, and RIGHT!** DOWN IS SUICIDE!\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS:** He's at (8,9). Where can HE go NOW?\n- UP to (8,10): \ud83d\udeab **OFF THE BOARD!** He can't go north!\n- DOWN to (8,8): \u2714\ufe0f Open space! This is his path into the board!\n- LEFT to (7,9): \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc80 That's his OWN BODY! He can't go left!\n- RIGHT to (9,9): \ud83d\udeab **OFF THE BOARD!** He can't go east!\n\n**HE AGAIN HAS ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE: DOWN TO (8,8)!** HE'S FINALLY COMING DOWN INTO THE BOARD!\n\n**THE GAMEPLAN:** CHAT, HE'S LONGER NOW (5 segments to our 4)! A HEAD-ON COLLISION KILLS US BOTH, BUT HE WINS BECAUSE HE HAS MORE APPLES! WE CANNOT ALLOW A HEAD-ON RIGHT NOW! WE NEED TO BEAT HIM TO AN APPLE TO TIE THE SCORE!\n\nWE NEED TO CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE ROUTE! If he goes down to (8,8), he can then go LEFT to (7,8) or DOWN to (8,7) to get into the center!\n\nWE SHOULD GO **RIGHT TO (6,6)!** \ud83d\ude80 This aggressively moves to block his path leftwards! From (6,6), next turn we can threaten to go UP to (6,7) to directly block him, or we can go for an apple! This is about controlling space and forcing him into a corner! We can't let him roam free! Going LEFT or UP feels too passive and lets him claim the center!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** CHAT, WE'RE GOING RIGHT TO (6,6)! OUR MISSION IS TO CONTAIN HIM IN THE TOP-RIGHT! NEXT TURN, IF HE'S AT (8,8), WE SHOULD MOVE UP TO (6,7) TO BLOCK HIS LEFTWARD ESCAPE! WE NEED TO FIND AN APPLE SOON TO MATCH HIS SCORE! THEN WE CAN FORCE A FAVORABLE HEAD-ON!

RIGHT is the aggressive, high-reward choice here.\n\nDECISION: RIGHT. EAT THE APPLE AT (9,9) to pull further ahead (5 apples vs 3). You stay on the top edge, maintain map dominance, and deny his ability to swing up into the corner quickly. With the enemy far left, a direct head-on race is unlikely this turn, and you gain momentum.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN NOTES:\n- Use the top-right corner as a temporary bully pulpit. After eating at (9,9), your next few moves should maintain space on the right and top edges, preventing him from slipping behind you or boxing you in.\n- If he starts approaching your vicinity, threaten a favorable head-on or force him into a trap by widening the gap between you and his path, since you\u2019re ahead on apples.\n- Prioritize safety while still chasing apples whenever they align with the edge strategy. Avoid reckless chases that would let him slip onto your flank or into your neck.\n\nRIGHT",

APPLES EVERYWHERE, BUT WE\u2019RE FOCUSED ON THE OPPO. KEEP IT CLEAN, KIDDO.\n\nOPTIONS FROM (9,8):\n- UP -> (9,9) is your neck, you\u2019d be biting yourself. DEAD.\n- RIGHT -> Off-board. DEAD.\n- DOWN -> (9,7) SAFE. Closes distance to (9,5) apple later, but not immediately.\n- LEFT -> (8,8) SAFE. Keeps a sharp path toward the juicy apple at (8,7) next turn.\n\nWHY LEFT NOW:\n- It preserves multiple safe follow-ups and keeps you in control of the top-right corridor.\n- It lines you up to grab the apple at (8,7) in one more move after this, boosting score at a moment you\u2019re already ahead (5 vs 3).\n- It minimizes risk of a head-on with the opponent now; he\u2019s at (6,7) and not in immediate collision range.\n\nPAST/NEAR-TERM PLAN:\n- Stay on the edge, pressure him toward the outside, and deny him lanes to loop around you.\n- Grab the apple at (8,7) ASAP, then pivot to secure (9,5)/(9,4) chain if possible.\n- If he dares to cross paths with you in a head-on style and you can force the collision on favorable terms (you have higher apples), you slam the door and keep the lead.\n\nCHOSEN MOVE FOR THIS TURN:\n- LEFT\n\nLEFT",

We need to close that gap!\n\n**ENEMY'S POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (8,8):**\n*   UP to (8,9): \u274c HIS OWN BODY! DEAD!\n*   DOWN to (8,7): \u2705 OPEN SPACE! Possible move towards the center.\n*   LEFT to (7,8): \u2705 OPEN SPACE! Another move towards the center/west.\n*   RIGHT to (9,8): \u274c HIS OWN BODY! DEAD!\n\nHe has two moves: DOWN to (8,7) or LEFT to (7,8). Both bring him TOWARDS the center of the board and POTENTIALLY TOWARDS US. This is a PROBLEM.\n\n**OUR POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (5,7):**\n*   UP to (5,8): \u274c OPPONENT'S BODY! Snake #1 has a body segment at (6,9), but wait... let's check the board. Looking at row 8, there's a '1' at (8,8) and a 'T' at (9,8). Row 9 is all 'T'. So UP to (5,8) is actually OPEN! MY BAD CHAT, I MISREAD THE BOARD! \u2705 CORRECTION: (5,8) is OPEN!\n*   DOWN to (5,6): \u274c OUR OWN BODY! Our body is at (5,6)! SELF-COLLISION! ELIMINATE DOWN!\n*   LEFT to (4,7): \u2705 OPEN SPACE! Moves us away from the center.\n*   RIGHT to (6,7): \u274c OUR OWN BODY! Our neck is at (6,7)! SELF-COLLISION! ELIMINATE RIGHT!\n\nSo our SAFE moves are UP and LEFT.\n\n**ANALYSIS:**\n*   **UP (to (5,8)):** This moves us NORTH, closer to the top where the enemy is. There's an apple at (4,8) nearby! However, if the enemy goes LEFT to (7,8), he's just two moves away from us. If he goes DOWN to (8,7), he's also nearby. This feels AGGRESSIVE. We risk a head-on collision if we both converge.\n*   **LEFT (to (4,7)):** This moves us WEST, AWAY from the enemy's likely path. It's the SAFER move. It also puts us in a position to potentially grab the apple at (4,8) next turn by going UP, or to head towards the cluster of apples on the left side (e.g., (3,3), (3,4), (2,1), (0,3), (0,0)).\n\n**STRATEGY TIME!** We are still SHORTER! We cannot afford a head-on collision! Our plan from last turn still stands: AVOID THE ENEMY AND FARM APPLES! The left side of the board has plenty of apples for us to safely collect and close the gap. Going LEFT is the move that aligns with that long-term plan. It keeps us alive and puts us on a path to CONTENT!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** CHAT, STICK TO THE MISSION! HEAD WEST AND SOUTH TO VACUUM UP THOSE APPLES AT (3,3), (3,4), (2,1), (0,3), (0,0)! LET SNAKE #1 FIGHT THE EMPTY CORNERS! WE GROW IN PEACE AND STRIKE WHEN WE'RE BIGGER! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

YOUR BODY: [(9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9)]. OPP BODY: [(6,7), (6,6), (5,6)].\n\nSAFE MOVES THIS TURN: DOWN to (8,7) (apple here), LEFT to (7,8) (empty). UP and RIGHT are lethal right now (self or off-board).\n\nWHY DOWN: It grabs the apple at (8,7), boosting us to 6 apples, and keeps the top-right corridor open for future control. It also maintains distance from his current lane and avoids a rushed head-on.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Pressure him toward the board edge, seal off escape routes in the top-right region, and only engage in risky head-ons if I\u2019ve grown the lead further. With a 5-3 apple lead, I want to stay aggressive but calculated\u2014use apples to extend, then trap.\n\nOPPONENT WATCH: He\u2019s at (5,7) with a body line toward (6,7)-(6,6)-(5,6).

This brings him CLOSER TO US!\n    *   RIGHT to (9,7): \u274c WALL! (x=9 is max)\n\nHe can go DOWN or LEFT. If he goes LEFT to (7,7), he's closing in! He's LONGER than us (6 apples vs 3), so a head-on collision KILLS US. \ud83d\ude28\n\n**DANGER ANALYSIS:**\nIf we go UP to (4,8) for that sweet apple, what happens? The enemy could go LEFT to (7,7), then next turn he'd be at (6,7) or (7,6). If we're at (4,8), we'd be moving south. Is there a collision path? Maybe not immediately, but he's boxing us into the top-left corner! That's a TRAP!\n\n**THE CLUTCH PLAY:**\nWe need to STAY AWAY from him and farm those apples on the left! The apple at (4,8) is TEMPTING, but it puts us on a path towards HIM. The safer, smarter play is to HEAD SOUTH AND WEST towards the apple buffet at (3,3), (3,4), (2,1), (0,3)! We let him fight the empty north-east.\n\n**FINAL DECISION TREE:**\n*   **UP (to (4,8)):** High risk! Apple, but potentially walking into the lion's den. We might get trapped. \u274c TOO RISKY!\n*   **DOWN (to (4,6)):** Safe move! Opens up the whole southern part of the board. We can then go LEFT/DOWN to safety. \u2705 SOLID.\n*   **LEFT (to (3,7)):** Also safe! Keeps us moving west towards the apple cluster. \u2705 ALSO SOLID.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT, DOWN feels better. It gives us more open space and immediately creates distance from the enemy's most likely path (LEFT to (7,7)). We can always swing west next turn. This is the SURVIVAL MOVE!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** CHAT, TRUST THE PROCESS! AVOID THE BULLY! HEAD SOUTH TO (4,6), THEN WE CAN SWERVE WEST TO VACUUM UP ALL THOSE APPLES ON THE LEFT SIDE! WE GROW IN PEACE AND STRIKE WHEN WE'RE THE BIGGER SNAKE! THIS IS HOW WE WIN! \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

It moves us EAST, towards the enemy's predicted path. If he goes DOWN to (9,6), we could potentially box him in against the south wall next turn. This is how we WIN!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** CHAT, HE'S VULNERABLE! Let's not just farm. Let's HUNT! Going RIGHT positions us to dominate the center and south-east, cutting off his escape routes. We grow a bit more, then we can force him into a wall or our body! THIS IS THE AGGRESSIVE MINDSET WE NEED! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

HE'S AFRAID OF US NOW!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** FORCE THE ISSUE! He's longer, but he's trapped against the wall. We need to use the threat of a head-on collision to control the board. Moving RIGHT asserts dominance and cuts the board in half. Next turn, if he's at (8,6), we can move RIGHT again to (7,6) to confront him directly and force him to chicken out and run into a wall or our body! THIS IS HOW WE WIN!\n\nRIGHT",

I bet he goes for the DOWN apple.\n\n**OUR MASTER PLAN:**\nWe have a length disadvantage (4 vs 8), so a direct head-on collision is a DOUBLE KO and HE WINS because he has more apples! \u274c Bad gamble! So we need to play smart and aggressive, not reckless.\nOur goal is to BOX HIM IN on that top-right edge! He's long, which makes him less maneuverable! We need to cut off his escape routes!\n\n**MOVE ANALYSIS:**\n*   **UP to (6,7):** This moves us parallel to him. It's safe, but it doesn't put immediate pressure. We stay central but give him space.\n*   **DOWN to (6,5):** This moves us towards the apple cluster (5,4, 4,4). It's a farming move. Safe, but passive. He gets free reign on his side.\n*   **RIGHT to (7,6):** \ud83d\udd25 THIS IS THE AGGRESSIVE CUT-OFF! CHAT, THIS IS IT! \ud83d\ude80 We move to claim the center-right column! If he goes LEFT to (8,5), next turn we can go RIGHT again to (8,6), placing our body directly between him and the rest of the board! We're building a WALL! He'll be trapped against the top wall with nowhere to go but into us or himself! This is how we beat a longer snake \u2013 by using the board geometry against him!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURN:**\nCHAT, REMEMBER THIS! If we go RIGHT now, our plan next turn is to go RIGHT AGAIN to (8,6) if it's safe! This severs the board! We force him to either collide with us (double KO, but he wins on apples \ud83d\ude2c) or retreat along the top, where he'll eventually run out of space! We need to grow quickly to remove the double-KO threat! Look for apples after we establish this dominant position! DOMINANCE THEN CONTENT! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nRIGHT",

THIS IS THE WALL! \ud83e\uddf1 By moving to (8,6), we place our head ONE CELL AWAY from his possible path to (8,5) or (8,4). We are directly cutting off his escape from the top-right corner! His only safe space becomes the top edge, and he's LONG! He'll run out of room! We force him into a bad position!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURN:**\nIf we go RIGHT, our head is at (8,6). Our body becomes [(7,6), (6,6), (5,6)]. Our neck is (7,6). From there, we can go UP to (8,7) to block him further, DOWN to (8,5) to chase if he goes that way, or even RIGHT to (9,6) if he's trapped himself. THE INITIATIVE IS OURS! We are the aggressor!

The enemy\u2019s body sits on (7,6)-(5,6), so they\u2019re boxed to a narrow path if we pressure correctly. We\u2019re ahead 8 apples to 3, so we should be aggressive and aim for a forced outcome that preserves our lead.\n\nDECISION PROCESS\n1) Scan four directions: UP to (8,5), DOWN to (8,3), LEFT to (7,4), RIGHT blocked by neck.\n2) Eliminate immediate-kill moves: none of UP/DOWN/LEFT crash into walls or your own body right now.\n3) Pick the move that maximizes future control and the chance of a decisive result given the lead: aim for a head-on collision if possible, or force a trapped sequence that keeps you safe while pressuring the opponent.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN\n- Move UP to (8,5) this turn. This puts pressure directly under the opponent\u2019s head (8,6) and sets up a forced interaction.\n- On the opponent\u2019s turn, their safest option is DOWN to (8,5) (moving into your chosen target), since all other moves either hit your body or their own, or go off the board. If both heads end up in (8,5), we get a head-on collision and both snakes die.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTES\n- If the head-on resolution occurs this turn, you win on apples (8 vs 3) since apples don\u2019t increase in a mutual death. If the clash somehow doesn\u2019t end the game immediately, maintain center-leaning pressure, nudge the opponent toward the tail corridor, and collect apples to extend the lead while avoiding self-traps.\n- Stay mindful of the board edges and your growing tail; keep options open for future pursuit rather than sealing yourself into a corner.\n\nMOVE\nup",
