Less strategic value.\n\nWhile all three directions (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe, **DOWN** is optimal because:  \n- It minimizes the steps needed to reach the apple at (2,3).  \n- Preserves flexibility to adjust direction later.  \n- Executes an offensive strategy to grow and accumulate apples.  \n\n**DOWN** aligns with the core objective: surviving the 150-turn limit while collecting apples.
