The snake cannot move downwards (to (2, 4)) or backwards (into its own body, (1, 5)) as those moves would end the game immediately. Moving right (to (3, 5)) could potentially hit the enemy's body at (3, 0), but since the enemy's head is at (3, 1), moving right seems safe. Moving up (to (2, 4)) is also safe and keeps the head away from the enemy. However, neither movement provides an immediate route to any apple.\n\nConsidering the long-term plan, moving up to (2, 4) would keep the snake away from the center and open up more future growth options. Moving up also keeps the snake safe from direct pursuit by the enemy and maintains a longer, more flexible body.\n\n**Final move:** UP",

I have already collected 1 apple.\n\n2. **Possible Moves**:\n   - **Left (0, 7)**: This move is safe and keeps me moving towards the snake's growth opportunities in the top-left quadrant of the board. It also helps me avoid potential head-on collisions with the enemy (Snake #0) whose head is moving towards me.\n   - **Right (2, 7)**: This move is into my own body and is not allowed.\n   - **Down (1, 8)**: This move could lead me into the cell directly behind my current head position, making it a risky move. There is an apple at (1, 8), but the risk of collision outweighs the potential reward.\n   - **Up (1, 6)**: This move takes me directly into your body and is not allowed.\n\n3. **Considering the Enemy Snake**:\n   - Snake #0's head is at (4, 3), and it is moving towards the top-left corner of the board. Moving left would likely move me away from the enemy's path, reducing the risk of a head-on collision.\n\n4. **Long-term Strategy**:\n   - By moving left, I can explore the top-left quadrant of the board, which appears to have several apple locations and fewer immediate threats.\n   - This move also keeps me connected to the growing cluster of apples to the left, increasing my chances of collecting more apples in the future.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most strategic move for my snake is to move **LEFT**.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns**:\n- Continue exploring the top-left quadrant of the board, searching for apples and maintaining a safe distance from enemy snakes.\n- Look for opportunities to grow by eating apples while avoiding potential head-on collisions with enemy snakes.\n- Always keep an eye on the positions of other snakes and adjust my movements accordingly to maximize my chances of survival and apple collection.\n\nLEFT",

It\u2019s far from danger currently and won\u2019t threaten us this turn.  \n\n**Apple-Rich Strategy:**  \nPrioritize the top-left quadrant for its abundance: apples at (1,8), (0,2/6/4), (5,5/4), (7,4), (6/7/9), (3,8/9), and others. Moving left opens access to these targets and avoids potential future collisions, as the enemy is distant.  \n\n**Long-Term Plan:**  \nExtend into the top-left, maintaining a balanced body that Since the enemy stays far, focus on snacking before counting risks. Avoid leaving isolated segments as we approach the top-left.  \n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**  \nLEFT",
