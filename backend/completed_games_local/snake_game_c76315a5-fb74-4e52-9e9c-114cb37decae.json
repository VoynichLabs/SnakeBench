          "rationale": "The board is 10x10 with apples at (1,3), (6,2), (4,4), (7,1), (2,7). My snake (ID 0) starts at (1,0). The enemy snake (ID 1) starts at (9,0). The board state shows apples plotted correctly. The grid coordinates: rows 9 top, 0 bottom. Columns 0 left, 9 right. My head is at (1,0). Enemy head at (9,0). My body is none, so no self-collision risk except moving backwards into where my tail would be? Since length is 1, moving backwards is not possible as there is no tail cell. But moving into my own body is not an issue because body is empty. However, moving backwards is defined as moving directly opposite to my previous move. Since there is no previous move, I cannot move backwards? The rule: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" This implies that if my head moves into the cell that my neck was in, I die. Since I have no neck, there is no cell behind my head. So backwards is not applicable. So only need to avoid walls and enemy body (none) and enemy head (which moves simultaneously). So we need to consider the enemy's possible moves. The enemy snake #1 has head at (9,0) and no body. So it's also length 1. It can move in any direction except maybe into itself? Same as us. It may try to eat apples too. There are apples at (1,3) (near us), (6,2), (4,4), (7,1), (2,7). The enemy is at (9,0) far right bottom. The nearest apple to enemy is (7,1) which is left and up? (7,1) is two left from (9,0)? Actually (9,0) to (7,1) is left 2, up 1. Not directly adjacent. (6,2) is left 3, up 2. So enemy might move towards those. We need to decide a safe move that also gets us closer to apples. Since we have no body, we can move in any direction except out of bounds. Let's check each direction:\n\nCurrent head (1,0).\n\n- UP: to (1,1). Check board: row 1 is within 0-9, column 1 is within 0-9. That's valid. Is there an apple at (1,1)? Board shows row 1 column 1 is '.' (see row 1: from the board state: \"1 . . . . . . . A . .\" So column 1 is '.' (first dot after the row number). No apple. Is there any snake body? My body none. Enemy body none. So safe.\n\n- DOWN: to (1,-1). That's off the board (y=-1). Not allowed. So DOWN is invalid.\n\n- LEFT: to (0,0). Column 0 is within bounds. Check board: row 0 column 0 is '.'? Row 0 shows \"0 . 0 . . . . . . 1\". Actually row 0: the board shows \"0 . 0 . . . . . . 1\". Let's parse: Column 0: the first character after the row number 0 is a space? Actually the representation: \"9 . . . . . . . . . .\" then each row is like \"8 . . . . . . . . . .\" etc. So row 0 line: \"0 . 0 . . . . . . 1\". That means: column 0: '.'? Wait, the pattern: row number, then space, then dot for each column? Actually the board is printed with dots for empty cells, 'A' for apples, '0' for my snake head, '1' for enemy snake head. So row 0: \"0 . 0 . . . . . . 1\". Let's index columns 0-9. After the row number and space, the first character is column 0. It's a '.'? Let's count: The string: \"0 . 0 . . . . . . 1\". That's: 0 (row number), space, then characters: '.'? Actually there is a space after the row number? The pattern from other rows: \"9 . . . . . . . . . .\" That's: 9, space, then a dot, space? Actually they separate each column with a space. So \"9 . . . . . . . . . .\" means: column0: '.'? Let's examine: After \"9 \" there is a dot, then space, then dot, etc. So each column is a character, then a space. So for row 0, it's \"0 . 0 . . . . . . 1\". So after \"0 \" we have '.'? Actually \"0 . 0 . . . . . . 1\": the characters: first after space is '.'? Let's split: tokens: \"0\", \".\", \"0\", \".\", \".\", \".\", \".\", \".\", \".\", \"1\". That's 10 tokens after the row number? Actually there should be 10 columns. Row number is not a column. So token list: first token is '.'? Let's count: I think it's: row number \"0\", then space, then for column 0: the next character is '.'? Actually the board uses '.' for empty. So column 0 of row 0 is '.'? Let's check from other rows: For row 1: \"1 . . . . . . . A . .\" That gives tokens: after row number, we have '.' for col0? Let's count: tokens: after \"1 \" we have '.' (col0), then space, then '.' (col1), space, then '.' (col2), space, then '.' (col3), space, then '.' (col4), space, then '.' (col5), space, then '.' (col6), space, then 'A' (col7), space, then '.' (col8), space, then '.' (col9). So yes, column 0 is '.'.\n\nNow row 0: \"0 . 0 . . . . . . 1\". After \"0 \" we have '.'? Actually the first token is '.'? Let's count: tokens: col0: '.'? But the first character after \"0 \" is a dot? The string: \"0 . 0 . . . . . . 1\". I see a dot, then space, then 0, then space, then dot, etc. Wait, there's a '0' in the middle. That's my head? My head is at (1,0). But row 0 is y=0. My head is at (1,0) which is row 0? Actually y=0 is the bottom row. My head is (1,0) so row 0 column 1. In the board, row 0 shows my head as '0' at column 1? The representation: row 0: \"0 . 0 . . . . . . 1\". Let's break:\n\n- Row number: 0\n- Then a space\n- Then column 0: maybe '.'? But the next character is '.'? Actually after \"0 \" there is a dot. That would be column 0 = '.'.\n- Then space\n- Then column 1: next character is '0'? That matches my head at (1,0). So column 1 = '0'.\n- Then space\n- Then column 2: next character is '.'? Actually the pattern: after column 1 there is space, then '.' for column 2? But the string: \"0 . 0 . . . . . . 1\". Let's index characters: \"0 . 0 . . . . . . 1\". I'll write with spaces: The string is: '0',' ','.',' ','0',' ','.',' ','.',' ','.',' ','.',' ','.',' ','1'? That seems off. Actually the board uses a space between each column symbol. So for row 0, the columns are separated by spaces. So the sequence after \"0 \" is: symbol for col0, space, symbol for col1, space, symbol for col2, space, symbol for col3, space, symbol for col4, space, symbol for col5, space, symbol for col6, space, symbol for col7, space, symbol for col8, space, symbol for col9.\n\nThus, for row 0, the symbols are: col0: '.', col1: '0', col2: '.', col3: '.', col4: '.', col5: '.', col6: '.', col7: '.', col8: '.', col9: '1'. But the given string \"0 . 0 . . . . . . 1\" has only 10 symbols? Actually it has: 0, ., 0, ., ., ., ., ., ., 1. That's 10 symbols including the row number? Wait, the row number is not part of the column symbols. The row number is separate. So after \"0 \" there are 10 symbols? The pattern: \"0 . 0 . . . . . . 1\". That is: symbol1: '.', symbol2: '0', symbol3: '.', symbol4: '.', symbol5: '.', symbol6: '.', symbol7: '.', symbol8: '.', symbol9: '1'? That's only 9 symbols? Let's count: I see: after \"0 \" we have '.' (col0), space, '0' (col1), space, '.' (col2), space, '.' (col3), space, '.' (col4), space, '.' (col5), space, '.' (col6), space, '.' (col7), space, '.' (col8), space, '1' (col9). That would be 10 symbols: col0 '.' , col1 '0' , col2 '.' , col3 '.' , col4 '.' , col5 '.' , col6 '.' , col7 '.' , col8 '.' , col9 '1'. That matches the string: after the row number, we have a dot, then a zero, then a dot, then a dot, then a dot, then a dot, then a dot, then a dot, then a dot, then a 1? Actually the string \"0 . 0 . . . . . . 1\" has: after \"0 \" there is a dot, then space, then 0, then space, then dot, space, dot, space, dot, space, dot, space, dot, space, dot, space, 1. That is 10 symbols: dot, 0, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, 1. So col0='.', col1='0', col2='.', col3='.', col4='.', col5='.', col6='.', col7='.', col8='.', col9='1'. That seems correct.\n\nThus, for LEFT move from (1,0) to (0,0): column 0, row 0. That is col0 row0, which is '.' (empty). So that is safe from obstacles. However, we need to check if enemy might move into (0,0) simultaneously. The enemy at (9,0) could move left multiple times? Actually in one turn, each snake moves one step. So enemy can move at most one cell. From (9,0), moving left goes to (8,0). That's not (0,0). So no collision. However, we must consider head-on collision if we both move into the same cell. That cell is (0,0). Could enemy reach (0,0) in one turn? No, because distance is 9 steps horizontally. So safe.\n\n- RIGHT: to (2,0). Check row 0 col2: from above, col2 is '.' (empty). So safe. Enemy moving left to (8,0) or other directions won't hit us. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo all four directions except DOWN are safe. Now, which move is best? We need to consider apples and future options.\n\nApples: (1,3) is directly above (1,0) by 3 steps. (2,7) is far. (4,4) is up-right. (6,2) is right-up. (7,1) is right-up from us? Actually (7,1) is far right.\n\nWe have many turns (150 total). The nearest apple is (1,3) which is up three steps. However, moving up now gets us closer. But also we might want to avoid the enemy. The enemy is at (9,0). The enemy might go for (7,1) or (6,2) or (4,4). The enemy might also move towards us? Unlikely.\n\nWe need to think about future: if we go UP now, we go to (1,1). Next turn we can go UP again to (1,2) then (1,3) to eat the apple. That seems safe. But we need to consider that the enemy might also move towards (1,3)? They are far. So likely we can get it.\n\nBut also we could go RIGHT to (2,0) then maybe go up later to get other apples. But (1,3) is directly above and seems easiest.\n\nWe should also consider that moving UP might put us closer to the top? Not an issue.\n\nNow, we must also consider that the enemy might move left and eventually get closer to us? Not likely soon.\n\nAlso, we must think about trapping ourselves. With a small board, we have many options. Moving UP now leaves us with at least three directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP) from (1,1) except maybe DOWN back to (1,0) which is safe if we don't have a tail. Actually moving DOWN from (1,1) would go back to (1,0), which is not occupied by our body because we moved from there. Since we have no tail yet, that cell becomes empty after we leave. So moving back is safe? The rule says moving directly backwards into your own body counts as hitting yourself. But if we move from (1,0) to (1,1), then on next turn if we move DOWN to (1,0), that is moving into the cell we just came from. Is that considered moving into our own body? Our body would be just the head at (1,1) and no tail because we haven't eaten. Actually after moving, the snake consists only of the head. The previous head position becomes empty. So there is no body at (1,0). So moving back to (1,0) is safe, because it's not occupied by our body. The rule about moving backwards applies only if there is a body segment behind the head. Since we have no body, it's fine. So we have flexibility.\n\nThus, moving UP seems good. But we should also consider that the enemy might move towards the apple (1,3) if they see it? They are far, but they could move left then up etc. However, we have a head start. Also, there are multiple apples. We could also go RIGHT to (2,0) to be more central, then go up to (2,3) etc. But (1,3) is closer now.\n\nLet's think about the enemy's possible moves: They are at (9,0). They see apples at (7,1) (distance 2: left 2, up 1) and (6,2) (left 3, up 2). They might move left or up. They might also move down? No, down is out of board. So they could move LEFT to (8,0), or UP to (9,1), or maybe RIGHT? Right is out of board. So they have three options: LEFT, UP. They might also move DOWN? Down would be out of bounds, so they die. So they won't choose that. So they will likely move LEFT towards the apples, or UP to start going up then left. If they move LEFT, they go to (8,0). That's still far from us.\n\nIf they move UP, they go to (9,1). Then from there they can move left etc.\n\nSo no immediate conflict.\n\nThus, our move: UP. But we need to ensure that moving UP does not cause a head-on collision with enemy if they move into (1,1) simultaneously. That is impossible because enemy is at (9,0), cannot reach (1,1) in one move. So safe.\n\nAlso, we need to consider if any other snake? Only two snakes. So safe.\n\nThus, I think UP is a good move.\n\nBut we should also consider that moving RIGHT might be safer in terms of avoiding being trapped by the board edge? Not really.\n\nAlso, we might want to plan for the next apple after (1,3). After eating (1,3), we will grow by 1. Then we have a tail. That might affect future moves. But we can handle later.\n\nNow, the decision: Among UP, LEFT, RIGHT, which one yields the best future options? Let's evaluate:\n\n- UP: moves toward (1,3). After reaching (1,3), we can go to other apples like (2,7) via (1,4) then (1,5) etc. Or we can go right towards (4,4) etc.\n\n- LEFT: moves to (0,0). Then we can go up along left edge. That might lead to (2,7) via (0,7) then right, but that's longer. Also (0,0) is corner, might be less flexible.\n\n- RIGHT: moves to (2,0). From there we can go up to (2,3) to get (1,3)? Actually (1,3) is left of (2,3). But we might still get it later. Also (2,0) is more central, allowing access to many apples.\n\nBut we already have an apple directly above, so why not go get it?\n\nThus, I choose UP.\n\nNow, the output must be exactly one word: UP. No extra text. But the instructions say: \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning. You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line. The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.\"\n\nSo I can write a reasoning before that. The last line must be the direction. So I will write a brief reasoning and then \"UP\".I am at (1,0) and the nearest apple is at (1,3) directly above. Moving UP gets me closer to that apple while keeping all options open. The enemy snake is far away at (9,0) and cannot reach me this turn. Moving DOWN is impossible (off board). LEFT and RIGHT are safe but less directly useful for early apple collection. I will move UP to start climbing toward (1,3).\n\nUP",

I just moved UP from (1, 2) to (1, 3) and ate an apple.\n- Enemy Snake #1: Head at (7, 1), Body at [(8, 1)].\n- Apples: (6, 2), (4, 4), (2, 7), (8, 4), (6, 7). Note that the apple at (1, 3) was just eaten, so it's no longer on the board.\n- Board size: 10x10 (0-9).\n- Objective: Survive and collect apples.\n\n**Step 1: Determine possible moves from my new head position (1, 3).**\nI need to check UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT for safety.\n\n- **UP (1, 4):** \n  - Within board? Yes, (1, 4) is inside 0-9.\n  - Is it occupied by any snake body?\n    - My body: [(1, 2)] - (1, 4) is not (1, 2).\n    - Enemy body: [(8, 1)] - (1, 4) is not (8, 1).\n  - Is it a valid move (not backwards)? My previous head was (1, 2), so moving to (1, 3) was UP. Moving to (1, 4) is UP relative to current head (1, 3), which is not backwards (backwards would be DOWN to (1, 2)).\n  - Result: Safe.\n\n- **DOWN (1, 2):**\n  - Within board? Yes.\n  - Occupied? My body is at (1, 2). This is my own tail.\n  - Rule: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" \n  - Since I just moved UP from (1, 2) to (1, 3), the cell behind me is (1, 2). Moving DOWN to (1, 2) is moving backwards into my own body.\n  - Result: Unsafe (Death).\n\n- **LEFT (0, 3):**\n  - Within board? Yes.\n  - Occupied? \n    - My body: [(1, 2)] - (0, 3) is not (1, 2).\n    - Enemy body: [(8, 1)] - (0, 3) is not (8, 1).\n  - Result: Safe.\n\n- **RIGHT (2, 3):**\n  - Within board? Yes.\n  - Occupied?\n    - My body: [(1, 2)] - (2, 3) is not (1, 2).\n    - Enemy body: [(8, 1)] - (2, 3) is not (8, 1).\n  - Result: Safe.\n\nSo, safe moves are: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves based on strategy (safety + apple potential).**\n\n*   **Long-term plan:** I am currently at (1, 3). I want to reach other apples: (6, 2), (4, 4), (2, 7), (8, 4), (6, 7). I am in the bottom-left area. I should generally move right/up to get closer to the center or other apples.\n*   **Immediate threats:** Enemy snake #1 is at (7, 1). It is far away. No immediate collision risk this turn unless it moves unpredictably towards me, but unlikely.\n*   **Option Analysis:**\n    *   **UP (1, 4):** Moves me away from the lower apples (like (6,2)). Opens up the top-left corner. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT (0, 3):** Moves me to the left wall. This restricts future moves (can't go left again). Usually bad for keeping options open.\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 3):** Moves me towards the center of the board and closer to apples like (4,4) and (2,7). This seems like the most strategic direction to access more apples.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI will eliminate DOWN immediately.\nLEFT traps me against the wall, so I will avoid it.\nUP is safe but moves me away from the dense apple cluster in the center/right area.\nRIGHT is safe, keeps me away from the wall, and sets me up to chase the apples at (4,4) or (2,7).\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move.\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\nFocus on navigating towards the apple at (2, 7) or (4, 4). Watch out for the enemy snake if it moves towards the center.\n\nRIGHT",

They are not a threat for this move.\n    *   My own body blocks DOWN.\n    *   Moving `RIGHT` to `(3, 7)` puts me in an open row and moves me closer to `(6, 7)`.\n    *   Moving `UP` to `(2, 8)` moves me away from the `(4, 4)` apple but might offer a path around the side.\n    *   Moving `LEFT` to `(1, 7)` moves me away from most apples.\n\n**Decision**:\nMoving `RIGHT` to `(3, 7)` is the most promising move. It keeps me in the same row as the apple at `(6, 7)` (only 3 spaces away) and opens up paths to the `(4, 4)` apple by eventually going down from a later coordinate. It is also safe from immediate collision.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nProceed towards the apple at (6, 7). If that becomes unsafe, navigate towards the cluster at (4, 4) by moving down later.

I moved DOWN last turn (Turn 11) from (5, 7) to (5, 6).\nSince I moved into an empty space on Turn 11, my tail (4, 7) will follow and move to (5, 7) on this turn (Turn 12).\n\n**1. Safety Check for Turn 12:**\nMy head is at `(5, 6)`.\n*   **UP**: Target `(5, 7)`. On this turn (Turn 12), my body segment at `(5, 7)` is still there (it hasn't moved yet, as I didn't eat an apple). However, simultaneous movement rules mean my head moves to `(5, 7)` while my tail moves *from* `(4, 7)` *to* `(5, 7)`? No, the head occupies the new cell, and the tail occupies the new cell. If `Head` and `Tail` target the same cell, it's a collision.\n    *   *Correction on mechanics*: The body moves in a chain. If I don't grow, the tail moves to where the body segment ahead was.\n    *   My body is `(5, 7) -> (4, 7)`.\n    *   If I move UP to `(5, 7)`, my head lands on my current body segment. This is **Fatal (Self Collision)**.\n*   **DOWN**: Target `(5, 5)`.\n    *   Board row 5: `. . . . . . . . . .`. Empty. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT**: Target `(6, 6)`.\n    *   Board row 6: `. . . . . . . . . .`. Empty. Safe.\n*   **LEFT**: Target `(4, 6)`.\n    *   Board row 6: `. . . . . . . . . .`. Empty. Safe.\n\n**2. Strategic Analysis:**\n*   **Goal**: Nearest apple is `(4, 4)`. Distance = 2 (Manhattan: `|4-5| + |4-6| = 1+2=3`).\n*   **Snake #1**: Head at `(5, 4)`. Body `(6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4)`.\n    *   If I go DOWN to `(5, 5)`: I will be 1 unit away from Snake #1's head at `(5, 4)`.\n    *   If I go LEFT to `(4, 6)`: Distance to `(4, 4)` is 2. Distance to Snake #1 is 2.\n    *   If I go RIGHT to `(6, 6)`: Distance to `(4, 4)` is 3. Distance to Snake #1 is 3.\n\n**Comparing Moves:**\n*   **DOWN to (5, 5)**:\n    *   Pros: Moves me directly towards the apple `(4, 4)`. Very efficient. Next move would be LEFT to `(4, 5)`, then DOWN to `(4, 4)`.\n    *   Cons: Puts me right next to Snake #1 at `(5, 4)`. Snake #1 is currently growing (it ate an apple recently, as per board history). If Snake #1 moves UP to `(5, 5)` while I move DOWN to `(5, 5)`, we die together (head-on collision). If Snake #1 moves LEFT to `(4, 4)` (eating the apple) and I move DOWN, I might be okay, but I lose the apple.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 6)**:\n    *   Pros: Moves towards `(4, 4)`. Keeps distance from Snake #1. Good safety margin.\n    *   Cons: Slightly slower to the apple than DOWN.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 6)**:\n    *   Pros: Safe. Opens up the right side.\n    *   Cons: Moves away from the closest apple `(4, 4)`.\n\n**Decision:**\nSnake #1 is at `(5, 4)`. It has plenty of space to its Left `(4, 4)` and Right `(6, 4)`. If it wants to survive, it should not blindly move UP into me. However, if it moves UP aggressively, DOWN is fatal.\nGoing **LEFT** to `(4, 6)` guarantees I survive the turn and remain on a path to `(4, 4)`. It avoids the direct confrontation path.\nGoing DOWN is risky because it relies on Snake #1 not moving UP. Given that Snake #1 usually acts rationally (avoiding death), it might not move UP if it sees me, but I cannot predict its move. `LEFT` is the safer strategic play that still closes the distance to the apple.\n\nWait, let's re-evaluate the DOWN risk.\nIf Snake #1 moves UP, I die.\nIf Snake #1 moves DOWN, it dies (wall at y=3 is empty but eventually hits y=0, but on turn 12, it's safe). No, it hits wall at y=-1? No, range 0-9.\nIf Snake #1 moves RIGHT to `(6, 4)`? It's currently at `(6, 4)`? No, Head is `(5, 4)` (Wait, the text says Head: (5, 4)). So Right is `(6, 4)` (Body).\nIf Snake #1 moves LEFT to `(4, 4)` (Apple).\nIf Snake #1 moves UP to `(5, 5)`.\nThe only move that kills me is UP.\nIs it likely to move UP? It sees the apple at `(4, 4)`. It is at `(5, 4)`. The apple is LEFT. It has no reason to go UP unless it's blocked.\nHowever, going LEFT puts me at `(4, 6)`. From there, I can go DOWN to `(4, 5)` and then `(4, 4)`.\nActually, `LEFT` is safer and still efficient.\n\nLet's look at `DOWN` again.\nIf I go DOWN to `(5, 5)`.\nNext turn (Turn 13), I can go LEFT to `(4, 5)` (safe).\nTurn 14, DOWN to `(4, 4)` (Apple).\nThis is the fastest route.\nIf I go LEFT to `(4, 6)`:\nTurn 13, DOWN to `(4, 5)`.\nTurn 14, DOWN to `(4, 4)` (Apple).\nIt's the same number of turns to the apple (Turn 14).\nBut `DOWN` leaves me at `(5, 5)`, adjacent to the enemy.\n`LEFT` leaves me at `(4, 6)`, away from the enemy.\n\nLet's consider the enemy.\nEnemy at `(5, 4)`. Body `(6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4)`.\nIf I go DOWN, I am at `(5, 5)`.\nIf the enemy goes UP, we die.\nIf the enemy goes LEFT, it eats the apple `(4, 4)` (on Turn 12? No, it needs to move to `(4, 4)` from `(5, 4)`? No, it's at `y=4`. To get to `(4, 4)` it needs to go LEFT. Yes. If it goes LEFT, it eats the apple. If it eats the apple, I should still survive the turn, but I lose the apple.\nHowever, the board state says the apple at `(4, 4)` is present.\nWait, if the enemy goes LEFT to `(4, 4)`, it eats the apple. I would be at `(5, 5)`. Safe.\nThe risk is strictly the UP move.\n\nWhy risk `DOWN`?\nBecause `LEFT` is also a good move.\nActually, `DOWN` is the only move that guarantees I am at `y=5` next turn.\nIf I go `LEFT` to `(4, 6)`:\nI am safe.\nNext turn I can go `DOWN` to `(4, 5)`.\nThen `DOWN` to `(4, 4)`.\nThis is a safe, predictable path.\nIf I go `DOWN` to `(5, 5)`:\nI am in a potential conflict zone.\nHowever, if I go `LEFT` to `(4, 6)`, I am moving away from the \"center\" but towards the apple.\nIs there any danger in going `LEFT`?\n`(4, 6)` is empty.\n`(4, 5)` is empty.\n`(4, 4)` is apple.\n`(4, 3)`... empty.\nThis path seems clear.\nAnd it avoids the enemy at `(5, 4)`.\nThe enemy is at `(5, 4)`. If it moves UP to `(5, 5)`, and I am at `(4, 6)`, I am safe.\nIf it moves LEFT to `(4, 4)`, I am safe.\nSo `LEFT` is strictly safer than `DOWN`.\nEfficiency: `DOWN` gets me to `x=5` `y=5`. `LEFT` gets me to `x=4` `y=6`.\nTo reach `(4, 4)`:\n- From `(5, 5)`: LEFT (to 4,5), DOWN (to 4,4). Total moves: 2.\n- From `(4, 6)`: DOWN (to 4,5), DOWN (to 4,4). Total moves: 2.\nThey are equal.\nHowever, from `(5, 5)`, I am blocking the enemy (threat). The enemy might block me.\nFrom `(4, 6)`, I am just claiming the apple lane.\n`LEFT` is the better choice.\n\nWait, what if the enemy moves RIGHT? It can't, body is there.\nWhat if the enemy moves DOWN? It goes to `(5, 3)`. Safe.\nWhat if the enemy moves UP? `(5, 5)`.\nIf I am at `(5, 5)`, we die.\nIf I am at `(4, 6)`, I survive.\nSo `LEFT` > `DOWN`.\n\nLet's check `RIGHT`.\n`RIGHT` to `(6, 6)`.\nThat's away from the apple. I want the apple. So `RIGHT` is bad.\n\nSo the choice is between `LEFT` and `DOWN`.\n`LEFT` is safer.\n`DOWN` is slightly more aggressive but risky.\nGiven \"Never choose a move that obviously kills you\", and `DOWN` has a plausible chance of killing me (if enemy moves UP), `LEFT` is the correct play.\n\nActually, let me re-read the \"Last Rationale\" summary I was given.\n\"My last move was RIGHT (Turn 10), taking me to (5, 7)?\"\nThe text says: \"Head: (5, 6)\".\nSo I moved DOWN from 11 to 12.\nWait, the user prompt says \"Turn: 12 / 150\".\nMy head is (5, 6).\nOkay.\n\nLet's double check the board.\nRow 6 (y=6): `. . . . . 0 . . .`\nRow 5 (y=5): `. . . . . . . . . .`\nRow 4 (y=4): `. . . . A 1 T T T .`\n\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 5):\nI am above the enemy at (5, 4).\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 6):\nI am at x=4, y=6.\nI am above the apple at (4, 4).\nThis puts me in a good position to defend the apple if needed.\nIf I go LEFT, I am on the \"Apple Line\" (x=4).\nIf I go DOWN, I am on the \"Conflict Line\" (x=5).\n\nLet's assume the enemy is rational.\nThe enemy is at (5, 4).\nIt sees the apple at (4, 4).\nIt should move LEFT.\nIf it moves LEFT, it eats the apple (on turn 12? No, it takes 1 move to get to (4, 4) from (5, 4)? No, Manhattan distance is 1. Yes, it can eat it this turn).\nIf the enemy eats the apple, it grows.\nI want the apple.\nIf I go DOWN (to 5,5), I am waiting.\nIf I go LEFT (to 4,6), I am ready to pounce next turn.\nWait, if enemy moves LEFT to (4, 4), it eats the apple.\nI am at (4, 6). I can go DOWN to (4, 5).\nThen next turn, I can go DOWN to (4, 4), but the apple will be gone.\nSo I should aim for the next apple.\nApples: (4, 4), (6, 7), (9, 9), (4, 0), (9, 0).\nWait, the board says Apples at: (4, 4), (6, 7), (9, 9), (4, 0), (9, 0).\nBut the initial description says I ate (6, 7). The board description is slightly contradictory or represents a moment in time.\nLet's trust the \"Apples at\" list in the prompt: `(4, 4), (6, 7), (9, 9), (4, 0), (9, 0)`.\nSo (6, 7) is an apple.\nBut the board shows `0` at (5, 6) and `.` at (6, 7). The \"Last Rationale\" says I ate (6, 7). The prompt's board state shows row 7 as `. . . T T 0 . . .` (Wait, the provided board state is row 7: `. . . T T A . . .`? No, row 7 in the prompt is `7 . . . T T A . . .`).\nLet's check the prompt's board again.\n`7 . . . T T A . . .`\nThis says there IS an apple at (6, 7).\nBut the text says: \"Apples at: ... (6, 7)\".\nOkay, so (6, 7) is an apple.\nMy head is at (5, 6).\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 6), I am next to (6, 7).\nIf I go UP to (5, 7), I die (body).\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 6).\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 5).\n\nSo, I have 3 apples nearby:\n1. (4, 4) - Distance 3.\n2. (6, 7) - Distance 2 (RIGHT, then UP).\n3. (4, 0) - Distance 7.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 6):\nTurn 12: (6, 6).\nTurn 13: (6, 7) - EAT.\nThis is the fastest route to an apple.\nWhy was I going for (4, 4) in my head?\n(4, 4) is close.\nBut (6, 7) is closer!\nManhattan distance:\n- To (4, 4): |5-4| + |6-4| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n- To (6, 7): |5-6| + |6-7| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nWait, is (6, 7) safe?\nEnemy is at (5, 4). He is far away.\nBoard is empty.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 6), I am moving away from the enemy.\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 6), I am moving towards the enemy (and the other apple).\nIf I go RIGHT:\nTurn 12: Head (6, 6). Body (5, 6), (5, 7). Tail (4, 7).\nTurn 13: Head (6, 7) - EAT.\nI grow.\nThen I am at (6, 7).\nFrom there, I have open space to the right (7,7 -> 9,7) and up (6,8 -> 6,9).\n(9, 9) is an apple.\nSo (6, 7) -> (7, 7) -> ... -> (9, 9) is a valid path.\nWhy did I dismiss RIGHT initially?\nI was fixated on (4, 4) because of the proximity to the enemy.\nBut (6, 7) is even closer and safer from the enemy.\nAnd it sets me up for (9, 9).\n\nLet's re-evaluate LEFT (to 4, 6).\nIf I go LEFT, I am on the path to (4, 4).\nBut if the enemy moves LEFT (to 4, 4), I lose that apple.\nThen I have to go for (4, 0) or turn around.\nIf I go RIGHT (to 6, 6), I get (6, 7).\nThen I have a clear path to (9, 9).\nThe enemy is at (5, 4).\nThe enemy sees (4, 4) and (9, 0).\n(4, 4) is close.\nIf the enemy takes (4, 4), I don't care because I'm taking (6, 7).\nSo RIGHT seems like the winning move.\nIt secures an apple immediately (next turn) and avoids conflict.\n\nLet's check safety of RIGHT.\nTarget: (6, 6).\nIs it occupied?\nBoard row 6: `. . . . . 0 . . .`\nSo (6, 6) is `.`. Safe.\nIs it occupied by enemy body? No.\nIs it occupied by enemy head? No, enemy is at y=4.\nSo RIGHT is safe.\n\nWhat about UP? (5, 7) is occupied by my body. Fatal.\nDOWN? (5, 5) is empty. Safe.\nLEFT? (4, 6) is empty. Safe.\n\nComparing RIGHT vs LEFT vs DOWN.\nRIGHT: Gets apple (6, 7) next turn. Safe. Avoids enemy.\nLEFT: Gets apple (4, 4) in 2 turns (if enemy doesn't take it). Risky if enemy goes Left.\nDOWN: Safe. Gets closer to (4, 4). Also safe.\n\nIs there any reason NOT to go RIGHT?\nIf I go RIGHT, I am committed to the right side.\nEnemy is on the left.\nThis splits the board nicely.\nI get (6, 7).\nI get (9, 9) later.\nI get (9, 0) later.\nEnemy gets (4, 4), (4, 0).\nThis is a good split.\n\nIf I go LEFT, I contest (4, 4).\nWhy contest an apple when I have a guaranteed apple at (6, 7)?\n(6, 7) is right there.\nSo RIGHT is the best move.\n\nWait, let me check the \"Last Rationale\" again.\n\"My last move was RIGHT to (5, 7).\"\n\"I ate the apple at (6, 7).\"\nWait, if I ate (6, 7) last turn, then (6, 7) is NOT an apple now.\nBut the prompt says \"Apples at: ... (6, 7)\".\nThere is a conflict between the \"Last Rationale\" (which is a simulation of my previous thought process) and the current state.\nThe \"Current State\" is the truth.\nThe prompt says: \"Apples at: (4, 4), (6, 7), (9, 9), (4, 0), (9, 0)\".\nThe board state shows: Row 7 (y=7) has an 'A' at (6, 7).\nThe board state shows: Row 6 (y=6) has '0' at (5, 6).\nSo (6, 7) is indeed an apple.\nThe \"Last Rationale\" provided in the prompt is just context, but if it claims I ate (6, 7), but the board says it's there, the board wins. Or, maybe I am misreading the \"Last Rationale\". \"I ate the apple at (6, 7).\" -> If I ate it, it should be gone.\nLet's look at the board state provided in the prompt:\n`7 . . . T T A . . .`\n`6 . . . . . 0 . . .`\n`(6, 7)` is 'A'. So it is an apple.\n`(5, 6)` is '0'. That's me.\nSo I did NOT eat (6, 7) yet.\nTherefore, (6, 7) is a valid target.\n\nSo, my plan:\nMove RIGHT to (6, 6).\nNext turn, UP to (6, 7) to eat the apple.\n\nIs there any other consideration?\nEnemy at (5, 4).\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at (6, 6).\nEnemy can't reach me.\nIf I go DOWN, I am at (5, 5).\nEnemy is at (5, 4).\nIf enemy goes UP, we collide.\nIf enemy goes LEFT, I am safe.\nRIGHT is safer than DOWN because it separates us.\n\nIs LEFT better than RIGHT?\nLEFT gets me closer to (4, 4).\nBut (4, 4) is contested.\nRIGHT gets me (6, 7) uncontested.\n(6, 7) -> (9, 9) is a good chain.\n(4, 4) -> (4, 0) is another chain.\nBut starting RIGHT gets me an apple faster.\n\nWait, I should check if I am trapped if I go RIGHT.\nI am at (5, 6). Go RIGHT to (6, 6).\nTurn 13: Head (6, 7) - EAT.\nTurn 14: Head (6, 8) or (7, 7).\nBoard is open.\nNo walls nearby.\nEnemy is far away.\nI am safe.\n\nSo, the best move is RIGHT.\n\nFinal check on self-collision:\nHead (5, 6). Body (5, 7), (4, 7).\nTarget (6, 6). Not in body. Safe.\n\nFinal check on enemy collision:\nHead (5, 4). Range is 4.\nI am at (6, 6).\nEven if enemy goes UP, (5, 5), we are not colliding.\nIf enemy goes UP, (5, 5), and I am at (6, 6), we are safe.\nIf enemy goes RIGHT (into body), dies.\nIf enemy goes UP (5, 5), then UP (5, 6), etc.\nIf enemy goes UP to (5, 5), and I am at (6, 6), distance is 2.\nIf enemy goes UP to (5, 6) next turn, and I am at (6, 7) (eating apple), distance is 1.\nBut I am at (6, 7) with a long tail.\nWait, if I eat (6, 7), I grow.\nMy body will be (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7).\nIf enemy goes to (5, 6), it hits my body.\nSo if I secure (6, 7), I block the left side of the board effectively.\nThis is very strong.\n\nSo, RIGHT is the move.\n\nWait, I need to output a single word.\nThe word is RIGHT.\n\nDouble check the board.\nRow 6: `. . . . . 0 . . .`\nColumn 6 is empty.\nSo RIGHT is empty.\nYes.\n\nIs there any trap?\nNo.\n\nSo, I will move RIGHT.\n\nWait, I should write the rationale first.\n\"Analysis:\nCurrent Head: (5, 6).\nOptions: UP (blocked by body), DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\nGoal: Eat apples.\nApples nearby: (4, 4) dist 3, (6, 7) dist 2.\nSnake #1 at (5, 4).\nRIGHT moves me to (6, 6). This is the safest move towards the closest apple (6, 7).\nDOWN moves to (5, 5), putting me near Snake #1.\nLEFT moves to (4, 6), moving towards contested apple (4, 4).\nRIGHT is best.\"\n\nWait, the instructions say \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\nSo I can write text before that.\nI'll write a short plan.\n\nPlan: Secure the apple at (6, 7) by moving RIGHT. Then proceed to (9, 9).\nMove: RIGHT.\n\nOne detail: The prompt says \"Turn: 12 / 150\".\nI need to be careful about the snake length.\nI have 2 apples. Length is 3 (Head + 2 Body).\nIf I eat (6, 7), length becomes 4.\nThe tail moves only if I don't eat.\nIf I eat, the tail stays put for this turn.\n\nLet's verify the \"Last Move\" info.\n\"Last Move: DOWN\".\nSo I am at (5, 6).\nBoard: Row 6 has '0' at (5, 6).\nEverything checks out.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT.\n\nWait, let me re-read the prompt one more time to ensure I didn't miss anything about the apple at (6, 7).\n\"Apples at: (4, 4), (6, 7), (9, 9), (4, 0), (9, 0)\"\nYes, it is there.\nI will go get it.\n\nIs there any chance (6, 7) is a trap?\nIt's an apple. Apples are safe squares (unless a snake enters at the same time).\nThe only risk is if another snake heads there.\nSnake #1 is at (5, 4). Manhattan distance to (6, 7) is |5-6| + |4-7| = 1 + 3 = 4.\nIt takes 4 moves.\nI take 2 moves.\nSo I will get there first.\nTherefore, it is safe.\n\nI will proceed with RIGHT.\n\nOne small check: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body ... counts as hitting yourself\".\nMy body is (5, 7). (5, 6) -> (5, 7) is backwards.\nSo UP is backwards.\nSo UP is lethal.\nLEFT is not backwards.\nRIGHT is not backwards.\nDOWN is not backwards.\n\nSo the plan is solid.\n\nFinal check on coordinates:\nX increases to the right.\nY increases up.\nHead (5, 6).\nRIGHT -> (6, 6).\n\nI will write the response now.\n\nReasoning summary:\n1. Head at (5, 6).\n2. UP is blocked by body (5, 7).\n3. Options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n4. Apples: (6, 7) is 2 steps away (RIGHT->RIGHT or RIGHT->UP). (4, 4) is 3 steps away.\n5. Enemy at (5, 4) is 4 steps away from (6, 7). I will reach it first.\n6. Moving RIGHT secures the closest apple and avoids the enemy.\n7. Moving DOWN puts me adjacent to the enemy (potential head-on collision risk).\n8. Moving LEFT moves me towards the enemy but away from the easier apple (6, 7).\n9. Conclusion: RIGHT is the best move.\n\nThe \"Last Rationale\" provided in the prompt mentions moving DOWN to target (4, 4). That was a valid strategy in the previous turn (Turn 11), but now that I am at (5, 6) and (6, 7) is available, the optimal path changes to securing the immediate apple. The previous rationale was for Turn 11, where (6, 7) might have been eaten? No, the board state for Turn 12 shows it exists. The \"Last Rationale\" says \"Apple at (6, 7) eaten by me\" but the current board and apple list say it is there. I must trust the current state. If the previous turn I ate (6, 7), it wouldn't be there. Since it is there, I didn't eat it. I will eat it now.\n\nWait, let's look at the \"Last Rationale\" text provided by the user.\n\"My last move was RIGHT to (5, 7). I ate the apple at (6, 7).\"\nAnd then: \"Board row 6: . . . . . . . . . .\" (This is likely a typo in the summary or represents a \"clean\" board view excluding the just eaten apple).\nBUT the main prompt says: \"Apples at: ... (6, 7)\".\nIf the prompt explicitly lists (6, 7) as an apple, I must treat it as an apple.\nIf the \"Last Rationale\" conflicts with the \"Apples\" list, the \"Apples\" list is the ground truth for the current turn.\nSo (6, 7) is an apple.\nI will go get it.\n\nWait, looking at the board state in the prompt:\nRow 7: `. . . T T A . . .`\nThis is the board for the CURRENT turn (Turn 12).\nIf I ate it on Turn 11 (my last move), it should be gone on Turn 12.\nThe fact that it's there means I did NOT eat it.\nWhy does the rationale say I ate it?\nMaybe I ate something else? No, it explicitly says (6, 7).\nMaybe the \"Last Rationale\" is a decoy or a mistake in the user prompt?\nI have to play the board I see.\nI see an apple at (6, 7).\nI see my head at (5, 6).\nI see an open space at (6, 6).\nI will go RIGHT.\n\nWait, if I ate (6, 7) on the last turn, my head would be at (6, 7) currently.\nBut my head is at (5, 6).\nSo I did NOT move RIGHT to (5, 7)? No, the user prompt says \"Head: (5, 6)\".\nIf I ate (6, 7), I would be at (6, 7).\nSo the \"Last Rationale\" description of the move (\"My last move was RIGHT to (5, 7). I ate the apple at (6, 7)\") must be incorrect regarding the apple, or it's a hypothetical previous state.\nHowever, the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" says \"DOWN\".\nWait, \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" says \"DOWN\".\nSo I moved DOWN.\nIf I moved DOWN to (5, 6), I did NOT eat (6, 7).\nThe \"Last Rationale\" text is just a block of text explaining the logic, but the actual state is: Head (5, 6), Apples include (6, 7).\nSo the \"I ate the apple\" part of the rationale is definitely wrong or refers to a different scenario.\nI will trust the \"Apples at\" list.\n\nSo, I am at (5, 6). Apple at (6, 7).\nMove RIGHT.\n\nOne final check. What if the enemy moves RIGHT? It can't. Body is there.\nWhat if the enemy moves UP? (5, 5).\nI am at (6, 6). Safe.\nWhat if the enemy moves LEFT? (4, 4).\nSafe.\n\nOkay, confident.\n\nMove: RIGHT.\n\nOne last thing: The prompt says \"Coordinate reminder: decreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\"\nSo RIGHT means increasing X from 5 to 6.\nCorrect.\n\nI will output:\nRIGHT\n\nWait, the instructions say: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo I should write something like:\n\"Secure apple at (6, 7), then aim for (9, 9). Avoid (5, 4) collision.\"\n\nAnd then \"RIGHT\".\n\nOkay.\n\nWhat about (4, 0) and (9, 0)?\nAfter (6, 7) -> (9, 9), I can go down the right wall to (9, 0).\nOr (4, 0).\n(4, 0) is on the left wall. Enemy is there.\n(9, 0) is on the right wall.\nSo (9, 0) is safer.\nSo (6, 7) -> (9, 9) -> (9, 0) is a good path.\n\nPlan: Secure (6, 7). Head to (9, 9).\n\nThe output should be:\nPlan: Secure the apple at (6, 7), then move towards (9, 9).\nRIGHT\n\nWait, the \"Last Rationale\" in the prompt format was:\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\n...\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nI should just provide my reasoning and then the move.\nThe prompt says \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\"\nSo I will do that.\n\nThe final line must be \"RIGHT\".\n\nI'll write the reasoning now.\n\nReasoning:\n- Current Head: (5, 6).\n- Apples: (6, 7) is adjacent (distance 2).\n- Enemy: Snake #1 at (5, 4).\n- Moves: UP (blocked), DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- RIGHT: Moves to (6, 6), adjacent to apple (6, 7). Safe from enemy.\n- DOWN: Moves to (5, 5). Puts me 1 unit from enemy (5, 4). Risky.\n- LEFT: Moves to (4, 6). Moves towards (4, 4), but (6, 7) is closer.\n- Decision: RIGHT is safest and most efficient.\n\nThe \"Last Rationale\" I was shown had me moving DOWN last turn. That's correct based on the head position (5, 6) if I moved down from (5, 7). So the history matches. The mention of eating (6, 7) was just a thought process error in that rationale text. I will ignore that error and follow the board.\n\nOne more check: Is (6, 7) blocked by anything?\nRow 7: `. . . T T A . . .`\nT is tails.\nMy tails are at (5, 7) and (4, 7).\nSo (6, 7) is 'A'. Apple.\nEmpty.\n\nOkay. I'm good.\n\nOutput:\n\n**Strategy:** My head is at (5, 6). The nearest apple is at (6, 7), distance 2. I will move RIGHT to (6, 6) to get closer to it. This avoids the immediate danger zone around Snake #1 at (5, 4) and keeps my path to the top-right open for the next apple at (9, 9).\n\nRIGHT",

However, it positions me to potentially go DOWN to (5, 6) or LEFT to (4, 7).\n        *   **Apples:** The closest high-value apple is (9, 9). The apples at the bottom are (4, 0), (9, 0), (5, 1). (5, 1) is close to the enemy snake at (4, 1).\n        *   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (4, 1). It is likely targeting the apple at (5, 1) or (4, 0). I am at (6, 7). Distance to (9, 9) is |9-6| + |9-7| = 3 + 2 = 5. Distance to (5, 1) is |5-6| + |1-7| = 1 + 6 = 7.\n        *   **Strategy:** I am currently behind in apples (3 vs 4). I need to catch up. The apple at (9, 9) is a significant goal. Moving UP gets me closer to that chain of apples at the top right.\n        *   **Safety:**\n            *   UP to (6, 8): Is (6, 8) dangerous? Enemy is far away. The only danger is if I trap myself later.\n            *   LEFT to (5, 7): Is (5, 7) dangerous? It puts me in a column that is empty. It might be slightly safer for maneuvering in open space, but it delays reaching the top apple.\n\n    *   **Decision:** I will move **UP**. This is the most direct route to the (9, 9) apple, which is essential to catch up to Snake #1. It maintains a straight line and keeps my tail (6, 6) clearing a path if I need to retreat, although (6, 6) is currently blocked by my body at (7, 6) and (6, 6) itself. Wait, if I move UP, my body shifts. (6, 6) becomes (7, 6)? No, the tail moves to where the previous segment was.\n        *   Current Body: (7, 7) -> (7, 6) -> (6, 6).\n        *   If I go UP: Head (6, 8). New Body: (6, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (7, 6).\n        *   This clears (6, 6) eventually. It's a good move.\n\n**Final Plan:** Move UP to approach the apple at (9, 9). This puts me at 3, 8. Next turn I will likely move RIGHT or UP depending on the board state.\n\nUP",

The apple at (9, 0) is below the enemy, but the path (9, 1) is blocked by the enemy's body. To reach the bottom area, I must go LEFT through (8, 8).\n\nMove Evaluation:\n1. **UP:** (9, 9).

BUT, moving DOWN locks me into the rightmost column (x=9). The enemy body is at (9, 1), blocking the descent to (9, 0).

To reach (9, 0), I must bypass the enemy body at (9, 1). The only way to do that is to enter the interior of the board (x < 9). Therefore, moving LEFT to (8, 8) is the necessary direction to open up paths to the apples. Moving DOWN to (9, 7) is a trap; it forces me to eventually turn LEFT anyway, but delays me and keeps me near the enemy.\n\nDecision:\n**LEFT** is the only move that opens up future options and avoids getting trapped on the wall.\n\nPlan:\nMove LEFT to (8, 8).

Use the open space at (7,6) and (6,6) to position for these apples.\n\nI am currently at (8, 6).\nAvailable apples: (4,0), (9,0), (0,1), (0,4), (7,4).\nMy body is at (8,7), (8,8), etc.\nEnemy snake #1 is at (8,4), (9,4), etc.\n\n1.  **Identify moves:**\n    *   UP: (8, 7). This is the cell directly behind my head (part of my body). **DIE**.\n    *   DOWN: (8, 5). Open. Safe.\n    *   LEFT: (7, 6). Open. Safe.\n    *   RIGHT: (9, 6). Open. Safe.\n\n2.  **Analyze moves:**\n    *   **UP:** Fatal.\n    *   **DOWN:** Moves towards the bottom of the board. However, enemy snake #1 is at (8,4). If I go DOWN to (8,5), and the enemy goes UP to (8,5), we collide and both die (assuming equal length) or I might lose if they have more apples. If the enemy stays or goes elsewhere, I can proceed. It brings me closer to (7,4) and (4,0). However, it commits me to the right side of the board where the enemy is also currently located. Also, if I go DOWN, my tail will move from (8,9) to (9,9), leaving (8,9) open.\n    *   **LEFT:** Moves to (7, 6). This is the central area. It opens up paths to (7,4) and (4,0). It moves away from the enemy at (8,4) and the blocked column at x=9. It seems the safest to create space.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Moves to (9, 6). The enemy snake is at (8,4) and (9,4). The column x=9 is effectively blocked by my own body at (9,8), (9,9) and the enemy tail at (9,3), etc. Moving RIGHT to (9,6) is a \"trap\" move. I would be squeezing between my own body at (9,8) and the board edge/enemy. If the enemy moves to block (9,5) or I get stuck, I die.\n\n3.  **Comparison:**\n    *   **DOWN vs LEFT:**\n        *   DOWN: Risks collision with Snake #1 at (8,4/5). High risk.\n        *   LEFT: Moves to open space (7,6). Avoids the column with the enemy (x=8/9). Enables access to the center apples.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    LEFT is the best move to escape the crowded right side and the potential collision zone with Snake #1. It provides the most freedom of movement for the next turn.\n\nLEFT",

While (7, 5) is currently empty, moving directly towards the enemy's column increases risk.\n    *   **UP (7, 7):** Moves away from the apples and the enemy. It is safe but stalls progress towards objectives.\n    *   **LEFT (6, 6):** This is the optimal move.\n        *   **Safety:** Moves away from my own tail growth (which will be at 9,9) and away from the enemy at (7,4).\n        *   **Positioning:** Opens up the central and left side of the board. From (6, 6), I can access the cluster of apples at (5, 1), (4, 0), and potentially (0, 1).\n        *   **Freedom:** It avoids the \"right-side trap\" where my body is congested at x=8 and x=9.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    Moving **LEFT** is the only move that guarantees immediate safety (unlike RIGHT) and provides the best long-term strategic positioning by moving towards the center/apples while maintaining distance from the enemy threat.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 6):** **Unsafe.** This cell is currently occupied by my own body (the segment immediately behind my head). Moving here counts as hitting myself. **DO NOT MOVE RIGHT.**\n\n2.  **Strategic Evaluation (Surviving Moves):**\n    *   **DOWN (6, 5):** This moves me closer to the enemy snake's column (x=6 vs x=6). The enemy head is at (6, 4). Moving down would bring me to (6, 5), directly above the enemy. If the enemy moves UP to (6, 5), we collide. If the enemy moves UP to (6, 5) and I move DOWN to (6, 5), we die simultaneously. This is a high-risk move as it aligns my path directly with the enemy's potential path.\n    *   **UP (6, 7):** This moves me away from the apples (cluster at bottom left) and towards the empty top-right. While safe, it stalls progress towards objectives.\n    *   **LEFT (5, 6):** This is the optimal move.\n        *   **Safety:** It moves away from my own body to the right and away from the enemy (who is at x=6 or moving to x=7/5). It also avoids the dangerous direct alignment with the enemy seen in the DOWN move.\n        *   **Positioning:** From (5, 6), I am well positioned to access the cluster of apples at (5, 1) and (4, 0) in the coming turns.\n        *   **Freedom:** It avoids the congestion on the right side of the board.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    Moving **LEFT** is the safest move that avoids immediate collision and keeps me on a path toward the nearest apples, while maintaining distance from the enemy threat.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

While (3,5) is not directly next to the enemy's head (5,2), it puts me on a collision course with the apple at (0,4) but also brings me closer to the enemy's body (which is at y=4). It is safer to maintain distance while the enemy is active.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**LEFT** is the optimal move. It avoids immediate death, maintains a safe distance from the enemy, and keeps my path open to the apples in the top-left quadrant (0,4) and (0,1).\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Continue moving Left to (2,6) and (1,6), then Down towards the apple cluster at (0,4), (0,1), and (4,0). Monitor enemy movement to ensure they don't cut off the bottom left corner.\n\nLEFT",

I just moved from (3, 6) to (2, 6).\n    *   **Safety:** Moving right returns my head to the cell occupied by my second body segment. This is moving backwards into myself. Result: **Death**.

It is a safe, forward-thinking move.\n\n3.  **DOWN (2, 5):**\n    *   **Obstacles:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** This moves me closer to the bottom and the enemy, but there is still plenty of space. No immediate threats.\n    *   **Strategy:** This starts the descent towards the apples. However, staying on the edge (moving LEFT) is often slightly safer as it reduces the number of adjacent open cells where an enemy could trap you.\n\n4.  **UP (2, 7):**\n    *   **Obstacles:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Moves into the corner.

It avoids immediate death, maintains a safe position on the edge, and continues the plan to approach the apple cluster at (0, 4) and (0, 1). Moving DOWN is also a strong contender, but on an empty board, reducing available moves for the opponent by taking the edge is a solid strategy.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Continue moving LEFT to (1,6) and (0,6), then DOWN towards the apple at (0,4).

Both are safe, but following the established path to the wall allows for a clean turn downwards along the wall.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (0,6), then DOWN to (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1) to eat the apples on the left wall.

The \"Last Move\" section seems to contain a contradiction between the \"PICK\" (DOWN) and the \"RATIONALE\" (which describes the previous turn's move as LEFT to (0,6) and logic for moving DOWN). However, the current board state shows my head at (0, 5), so the DOWN move was executed.\n\nCurrent position: Head (0, 5), Body [(0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6)].\nApples: (4, 0), (9, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (2, 5).\nWait, looking at the board state provided:\nRow 5: `0 . A . . . . . . .`\nThis indicates at y=5, x=0 is my head, and there is an apple at x=2, y=5. There is NO apple at (0, 4) in this board state. The apple at (0, 4) from the listed apples must have been eaten or is incorrect in the text vs visual. Let's check the text list again: Apples at: (4, 0), (9, 0), (0, 1), (0, 4), (2, 5).\nLet's check the board visual:\nRow 5: `0 . A . . . . . . .` -> (0,5) Head, (2,5) Apple.\nRow 4: `A . . . . T T T . .` -> (0,4) Apple (Matches list).\nRow 1: `A . . T T T . . . .` -> (0,1) Apple.\nRow 0: `. . . . A . . . . A` -> (4,0) and (9,0) Apples.\n\nOkay, there IS an apple at (0,4). The board row 4 shows an 'A' at the start: `A . .`. Yes.\n\nMy immediate goal is the apple at (0,4).\nCurrent: (0,5).\nNext move DOWN -> (0,4). This eats the apple.\n\nLet's check safety:\n1.  **Board Bounds**: (0,4) is within [0,9].\n2.  **My Body**:\n    My body segments (excluding head) are: (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (4, 6).\n    (0,4) is not in this list.\n    Also, I am not moving backwards. My previous position was (0,6). Moving to (0,4) is not (0,6).\n3.  **Enemy Snake #1**:\n    Head: (3, 2). Body: [(3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4)].\n    Target (0,4) is far from enemy head and body.\n\nSo, DOWN is safe and eats an apple.\n\nWhat about other options?\n-   UP: (0,6). This is my current tail position? Wait, let's look at the body again.\n    Head (0,5). Body: (0,6), (1,6)... etc.\n    The tail is (4,6).\n    Moving UP to (0,6) moves into (0,6), which is the first segment of my body. This is suicide. So UP is UNSAFE.\n-   LEFT: (-1,5). Off board. UNSAFE.\n-   RIGHT: (1,5). Is this safe? My body is at (0,6), (1,6)... (1,5) is not occupied by me. It's empty space. So RIGHT is safe, but DOWN leads to an apple.\n\nWait, let's check the \"Rules\" about \"moving directly backwards\".\n\"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself\".\nMy head is at (0,5).\nPrevious position was (0,6).\nThe direction from (0,6) to (0,5) was DOWN.\nThe direction \"behind\" the head is UP (towards (0,6)).\nSo moving UP would be moving backwards into my body.\nMoving DOWN is the way I came? No, I came from UP.\nI came from (0,6) to (0,5). So (0,6) is behind me.\nMoving DOWN is forward.\n\nLet's re-verify the \"UP\" move.\nCurrent Head: (0,5).\nMove UP -> (0,6).\nIs (0,6) in my body?\nYes. The body list starts with [(0, 6), ...].\nSo (0,6) is the segment immediately connected to my head.\nMoving there is hitting myself.\nSo UP is definitely UNSAFE.\n\nDOWN to (0,4) is the only move that gets an apple immediately.\nIs there any danger from enemy prediction?\nEnemy at (3,2). Apples at (4,0), (9,0), (0,1), (0,4), (2,5).\nEnemy is closer to (2,5) (distance |3-2|+|2-5|=4) than I am (distance |0-2|+|5-5|=2).\nWait, I am at (0,5). Apple at (2,5). Distance 2.\nEnemy at (3,2). Apple at (2,5). Distance 4.\nSo I am closer to (2,5).\nHowever, enemy might go for (4,0) or (9,0).\nI am safe on the left wall.\n\nDecision: Go DOWN to (0,4) to eat the apple.\n\nLong-term plan:\nEat the apple at (0,4). Then I will be at (0,4) with length 6 (effectively, since I ate, the tail won't move this turn? No, wait. Snake grows when eating. The tail stays for one turn. Actually, standard snake rules: if you eat, you grow (tail doesn't move). If you don't eat, tail moves.\nGiven I eat, I grow.\nNext turn I will be at (0,4). Body will be (0,5), (0,6), (1,6)...\nFrom (0,4), I can go to (0,1) eventually, or turn right towards (2,5) or (4,0).\n(0,1) is quite far down. (0,4) to (0,1) is distance 3.\n(2,5) is to the right.\nBut let's just focus on this turn.\n\nDOWN\n\nWait, I should double check the \"Rules\" again.\n\"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\"\nIf Enemy moves into my body, I survive.\nIf Enemy moves into my head (same square), we both die.\n\nIs there any scenario where Enemy could hit (0,4)?\nEnemy is at (3,2). To reach (0,4) in one turn, they would need to move UP-LEFT-LEFT? No, one move only.\nThey can only reach adjacent squares: (2,2), (4,2), (3,1), (3,3).\nSo they cannot hit me at (0,4).\n\nIs there any scenario where I hit the enemy?\nI am at (0,5). I move to (0,4).\nEnemy is at (3,2).\nThey might move. Where might they go?\nApples: (4,0), (9,0), (0,1), (0,4), (2,5).\nThey are at (3,2).\n(4,0) is distance |3-4| + |2-0| = 3.\n(2,5) is distance |3-2| + |2-5| = 4.\n(0,1) is distance |3-0| + |2-1| = 4.\n(0,4) is distance |3-0| + |2-4| = 5.\nThey might go DOWN to (3,1) (closer to (4,0) and (0,1)? No, (3,1) is closer to (0,1)? (3,1) to (0,1) is 3. (3,2) to (0,1) is 4. So (3,1) is closer to (0,1).\n(3,1) is also closer to (4,0) (dist 4 vs 3).\nWait, (4,0) is at (4,0). From (3,2), distance is 3. From (3,1), distance is 4.\nSo (3,1) moves AWAY from (4,0).\n(3,2) to (4,2) is closer to (4,0)? Dist 3.\n(3,2) to (3,1) is closer to (0,1). Dist 3.\n(3,2) to (3,3) is closer to (2,5)? Dist |3-2|+|3-5| = 3. Same as current.\n(3,2) to (2,2) is closer to (2,5)? Dist |2-2|+|2-5| = 3. Same as current.\nActually, (2,5) is quite far.\nThe closest apples to Enemy are (4,0) and maybe (0,1).\n(0,1) is also close to me (from my path).\n\nRegardless, my move DOWN is safe against the enemy.\nMy move DOWN is safe against myself.\nMy move DOWN gets an apple.\n\nFinal check:\nHead (0,5). Move DOWN to (0,4).\nIs (0,4) occupied?\nBoard: Row 4 starts with `A`. So (0,4) is an apple.\nIs it occupied by enemy body? No.\nIs it occupied by my body? No (My body is at y=6).\nSo it is safe.\n\nOne detail: The board shows `A` at (0,4). The apple list includes (0,4). I assume the visual is correct.\n\nMove: DOWN.\n\n**Plan:**\nEat the apple at (0,4). Then look to move towards the apple at (2,5) or (0,1).\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Thinking through the moves:\n\nCurrent State:\n- My Head: (0, 3)\n- My Body: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6)\n- Enemy Snake #1: Head at (2, 3), Body trailing at (2, 2), (3, 2), etc.\n- Apples: (4,0), (9,0), (0,1), (2,5), (8,2)\n\nAnalysis:\n1.  **Backwards Check**: My previous move was DOWN to (0, 3). My tail before the move was at (3, 6) (based on the body list ending at (3, 6)). Wait, looking at the board state:\n    - Row 3 has `0` at (0,3).\n    - Row 4 has `T` at (0,4).\n    - Row 5 has `T` at (0,5).\n    - Row 6 has `T` at (0,6).\n    - This confirms my body is at (0,4), (0,5), (0,6).\n    - The prompt says \"Your last move information: ... DOWN\".\n    - The prompt also says \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself\".\n    - If I move UP, I go to (0, 4). (0, 4) is my current body segment (immediately behind my head). Moving UP returns me to the cell I just vacated. This is a backwards move and kills me.\n\n2.  **Safety Checks**:\n    *   **UP**: (0, 4). This is my body. -> **DEAD**.\n    *   **DOWN**: (0, 2). Is it safe?\n        *   Bounds: (0, 2) is valid.\n        *   My Body: My body is at (0,3) (head), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6). (0,2) is not in there.\n        *   Enemy Body: Enemy #1 is at (2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). (0,2) is far away.\n        *   Enemy Head: Enemy #1 is at (2,3). If they move UP, they go to (2,4). If they move DOWN, (2,2) (body). Left (1,3). Right (3,3). None of these hit (0,2). So (0,2) is safe.\n    *   **LEFT**: (-1, 3). Out of bounds. -> **DEAD**.\n    *   **RIGHT**: (1, 3). Is it safe?\n        *   Bounds: Valid.\n        *   My Body: No.\n        *   Enemy Body: No.\n        *   Enemy Head: Enemy #1 is at (2,3). Distance is 1.\n            *   If Enemy moves LEFT to (1,3), we collide head-on. Both die.\n            *   However, usually \"Safe\" means *I* survive. Head-on collision kills me. I should avoid this.\n            *   Can Enemy move into my body? My body at (0,4), (1,4)... wait. My body is (0,4)...\n            *   If I move RIGHT to (1,3), my tail moves from (3,6) to (2,6) (if not eating). My body occupies (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,6), (2,6).\n            *   Enemy head at (2,3) moves to (1,3). (1,3) is my new head position. Head-on collision.\n            *   Enemy head at (2,3) moves to (2,4). Safe.\n            *   Enemy head at (2,3) moves to (2,2). Safe (it's their body).\n            *   Enemy head at (2,3) moves to (3,3). Safe.\n            *   Enemy head at (2,3) could also move DOWN? No, (2,2) is body.\n            *   Risk of Head-on collision is high if I go RIGHT.\n            *   Is (1,3) occupied by a wall? No.\n            *   Is (1,3) occupied by an enemy body? No.\n            *   Is it occupied by my body? No.\n            *   The only immediate death risk on (1,3) is the Enemy moving there simultaneously. Given the enemy is at (2,3) and I am at (0,3), they are adjacent. It's a likely confrontation.\n            *   However, \"Safe\" usually means valid coordinates and no static collision. Collision with another head is a simultaneous event.\n            *   Let's compare DOWN and RIGHT.\n            *   DOWN: (0, 2). No apples. No immediate body collision. Enemy cannot reach me.\n            *   RIGHT: (1, 3). Collision risk with Enemy (Snake #1).\n            *   Also, looking at the board, I am effectively trapped in the column 0 if I don't move out. But moving right into the enemy is dangerous.\n\n3.  **Strategy**:\n    *   My goal is to survive and collect apples. Snake #1 has 8 apples, I have 6.\n    *   I have an apple at (0, 1) to my DOWN. If I go DOWN to (0, 2), next turn I can go DOWN to (0, 1) to eat.\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (1, 3), I get closer to (2, 5) apple, but I face the enemy.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate the collision. If I move RIGHT to (1,3), and Enemy moves LEFT to (1,3), we both die.\n    *   If I move DOWN to (0,2), I am safe. Even if Enemy moves, they can't hit (0,2) in one turn (they are at (2,3)).\n    *   So, DOWN is safer than RIGHT.\n    *   Is there any other option?\n    *   UP is death (backwards).\n    *   LEFT is death (wall).\n    *   So the choice is between DOWN and RIGHT.\n    *   DOWN leads to (0,1) apple.\n    *   RIGHT leads to potential confrontation.\n    *   Given the rule \"You cannot win if you are dead\", avoiding the collision is paramount.\n\n4.  **Detailed Check on DOWN**:\n    *   Move to (0, 2).\n    *   Is (0, 2) an apple? No.\n    *   My new body: (0, 3) -> (0, 2).\n    *   Old body segments: (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6).\n    *   Tail (3, 6) moves to (2, 6). (This assumes I didn't eat).\n    *   New body segments: (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6).\n    *   Is this valid? Yes.\n\n5.  **Detailed Check on RIGHT**:\n    *   Move to (1, 3).\n    *   Is (1, 3) an apple? No.\n    *   Enemy at (2, 3).\n    *   If Enemy moves LEFT (into my intended cell), collision.\n    *   If Enemy moves UP, DOWN, RIGHT, no collision.\n    *   However, the prompt says \"Eliminate any move that would immediately kill you\". A move that results in a head-on collision is a move that kills you. It's a 25% chance of death if the enemy is equally likely to move any direction (or 100% if they choose to attack). Since I don't know their move, I should avoid the potential collision.\n    *   Down is 0% collision chance.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   Move DOWN. It leads to the apple at (0, 1) eventually and avoids the enemy.\n\nPlan:\nMove DOWN to get closer to the apple at (0, 1). Avoid moving RIGHT into the enemy snake at (2, 3).\n\nNext Move:\nDOWN",

Analyze Current State:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at (0, 2), Body at [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6)].\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (2, 4), Body at [(2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)].\n*   **Turn:** 37 / 150.\n*   **Apples:** (4, 0), (9, 0), (0, 1), (2, 5), (8, 2).\n\n**2. Evaluate Moves:**\n\n*   **UP (to 0, 3):** I just moved DOWN from (0, 3) to (0, 2). Moving back UP would move my head into my own body segment at (0, 3). This results in immediate death. **Eliminated.**\n\n*   **LEFT (to -1, 2):** This is outside the board boundaries (x must be 0-9). **Eliminated.**\n\n*   **RIGHT (to 1, 2):**\n    *   Check boundaries: Valid.\n    *   Check self-collision: My body is at (0, 3), (0, 4)... (2, 6). (1, 2) is safe.\n    *   Check enemy body: Enemy body is at (2, 3) down to (5, 3) and left to (3, 1). (1, 2) is safe.\n    *   *Simultaneous movement check:* The enemy head is at (2, 4). If the enemy moves LEFT to (1, 4), no collision. If they move DOWN to (2, 3), no collision. If they move UP or RIGHT, no collision. They cannot reach (1, 2) this turn.\n    *   *Future Outlook:* (1, 2) opens up access to the center of the board and apples like (2, 5). However, I am currently in a \"corridor\" formed by my own body (0, 3 to 0, 6) and the wall/empty space. Moving out of this column is generally risky, but safe for this specific turn.\n\n*   **DOWN (to 0, 1):**\n    *   Check boundaries: Valid.\n    *   Check self-collision: My body is at (0, 3) upwards. (0, 1) is safe.\n    *   Check enemy body: Safe.\n    *   *Simultaneous movement check:* Enemy head is at (2, 4). They cannot reach (0, 1) this turn.\n    *   *Apple:* (0, 1) contains an apple! Eating it is a primary objective.\n    *   *Future Outlook:* Eating at (0, 1) allows me to grow. My tail will not move forward next turn (since I'm eating), maintaining the integrity of my body \"corridor\" slightly longer, but usually growing is the best play. The apple at (0, 1) is directly in my path and safe.\n\n**3. Decision:**\nComparing the two safe moves, RIGHT and DOWN:\n*   **RIGHT** is safe but leads to open space where I might encounter the enemy or risk getting cut off. It does not guarantee an immediate point.\n*   **DOWN** is safe and leads directly to an apple at (0, 1). Eating the apple increases my score to 7, getting me closer to Snake #1's 8 apples. Staying in the column (0) is also controllable; I know the cells behind me will clear up as I move forward.\n\nMoving DOWN is the best choice because it is safe and immediately rewards a point.\n\nDOWN",

Apples: 9.\n*   **Turn:** 38 / 150.\n*   **Apples:** (4, 0), (9, 0), (8, 2), (5, 0), (1, 7).\n*   **Last Move:** My head was at (0, 2) and I moved DOWN to (0, 1). Since I moved DOWN to get here, moving UP would be reversing into my own body at (0, 2), which is fatal.\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (0, 1):**\n\n1.  **UP:** Target (0, 2). This is occupied by my body segment (the segment that was the head before my last move). Moving here would cause me to collide with myself. **Invalid.**\n2.  **LEFT:** Target (-1, 1). This is outside the board boundaries. **Invalid.**\n3.  **RIGHT:** Target (1, 1).\n    *   **Safety:** (1, 1) is currently empty. My body extends down from (0, 2) and right to (2, 6), so (1, 1) is safe from self-collision. The enemy snake is located near (2, 5) and extends to (5, 3), so (1, 1) is safe from the enemy body.\n    *   **Conflict Check:** We must consider where the enemy snake at (2, 5) might move. If it moves LEFT, it will go to (1, 5). If it moves DOWN, it goes to (2, 4). If it moves UP or RIGHT, it stays away. The head-on collision risk at (1, 1) is very low.\n    *   **Value:** (1, 1) offers an open path. However, there are no apples immediately accessible from there (nearest are (5,0) and (1,7)).\n4.  **DOWN:** Target (0, 0).\n    *   **Safety:** (0, 0) is a corner. My body is at (0, 2) and above. The enemy is far away. This is safe from collision.\n    *   **Value:** (0, 0) is empty. However, looking at the board state provided, there is an apple at (4, 0) and (9, 0). Moving to (0, 0) would stick me in a corner, forcing a reversal later to escape, which is dangerous.\n    *   **Wait:** The board display shows row 0 as: ` . . . . A A . . . A` at coordinates (0, 0) through (9, 0). The prompt's list of apples includes `(4, 0), (9, 0), (8, 2), (5, 0), (1, 7)`. The board visually matches the list (Apples at 4, 5, 9).\n    *   **Correction:** The board diagram shows `(5,0)` is an apple (`A`). My current position is `(0,1)`. If I move `DOWN`, I go to `(0,0)`.\n    *   *Re-reading the prompt carefully:* \"Apples at: (4, 0), (9, 0), (8, 2), (5, 0), (1, 7)\".\n    *   Looking at the board diagram at Row 0: ` . . . . A A . . . A`. This corresponds to `x=0` to `9`. `A`s are at `x=4`, `x=5`, and `x=9`. This matches the list exactly.\n    *   So, there is **NO** apple at (0,0).\n\n**Decision:**\n*   **UP and LEFT** are fatal/invalid.\n*   **DOWN** moves to (0,0), which is a safe square but leads to a dead end (corner). It does not collect an apple.\n*   **RIGHT** moves to (1,1). This is a safe square. It moves me away from the wall and allows me to turn towards the center or the bottom apples. It maintains flexibility.\n\nSince `DOWN` leads to a corner trap and `RIGHT` leads to a more open area while maintaining safety, `RIGHT` is the superior move.\n\n**Strategy:**\nMove to (1, 1) to get out of the corner. From there, I can assess moving towards the apples on the bottom row (x=4, x=5, x=9) or pivoting up towards (1, 7). The enemy snake is at (2, 5) and has a long tail. I need to be careful not to get cut off by their head if they decide to expand into the left side, but for this immediate turn, securing position is key.\n\nRIGHT",

I am at (1, 1).\n\nI need to choose a move from (1, 1) that avoids collision.\nMy immediate options are:\n1.  **UP to (1, 2)**:\n    *   (1, 2) is currently empty.\n    *   However, the enemy snake #1's body passes through (2, 2). If the enemy moves **LEFT** to (1, 2), we will have a head-on collision and both die. The enemy is at (1, 5) currently (body to the right), so moving LEFT is a possible move for them.\n    *   If I move UP, I open up the path to the top of the board and the apple at (1, 7).\n\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 0)**:\n    *   (1, 0) is currently empty.\n    *   The enemy snake's tail is at (5, 2), far away. They cannot reach (1, 0) this turn.\n    *   This moves me towards the apples at (4, 0), (5, 0), and (9, 0).\n    *   From (1, 0), I can move to (2, 0), (3, 0), etc., creating a path to the apples. This seems like a very safe and productive route.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 1)**:\n    *   This is the square I just came from (turn 38). It is now part of my body (the second segment).\n    *   Moving there would be fatal (hitting myself). **Invalid**.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 1)**:\n    *   Currently empty.\n    *   However, the enemy snake #1 is currently at (1, 5) and (2, 5). Their body continues down to (2, 2).\n    *   The distance from (2, 1) to (2, 2) is 1.\n    *   If I move to (2, 1), the enemy could potentially move DOWN to (2, 4) or stay, but the critical risk is if they move in a way that blocks me. Actually, looking at the map, (2, 1) is adjacent to (2, 2) which is the enemy's body.\n    *   More importantly, (1, 1) is in the corner (wall at x=0). Moving DOWN to (1, 0) allows me to go to (2, 0), then (3, 0)... essentially a \"wall ride\" to collect the bottom apples.\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (2, 1), I am getting closer to the enemy's body without a clear open space on the other side, and the path forward (x>2) might be blocked by the enemy's tail or body parts.\n\nComparing **UP (1, 2)** vs **DOWN (1, 0)**:\n*   **UP** has the risk of head-on collision if the enemy moves LEFT. The enemy is currently at (1, 5). They are likely looking for apples or space. Moving LEFT reduces their distance to their own tail and walls them in, but it's a risk. Also, moving UP takes me away from the easily accessible bottom apples.\n*   **DOWN** moves me to (1, 0). From there, I can proceed to (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0). (4, 0) is an apple. This path is open. The enemy cannot intercept me on this path immediately. This secures a future apple.\n\nTherefore, **DOWN** is the safest and most strategic move. It guarantees I don't hit the enemy (they can't reach x=1, y=0 in one turn) and it keeps me away from my body. It moves me closer to the cluster of apples on the bottom row.\n\nDOWN\n**Strategy:**\nMove to (1, 0) to start the journey along the bottom row to collect the apples at (4, 0), (5, 0), and (9, 0). The path (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (3,0) -> (4,0) is clear of the enemy for now. I must remain aware of the enemy at (1, 5), but the bottom row is currently safer.\n\nDOWN",

While the path is currently open, it increases proximity to the enemy.\n2.  **DOWN** to `(1, 0)`: My body extends from `(1, 1)` to `(0, 1)` to `(0, 0)` and likely `(1, 0)` or similar. Looking at the board map, `(1, 0)` is empty (`.`), but the body segment `0` is at `(1, 0)`? No, looking at the board map: `0 . 0 . . A A . . . A` on row 0. This means `0` is at `(0, 0)` and `(2, 0)`. Wait, the text says `Head: (1, 0)` in the header, but the turn 39 header says `Head: (1, 1)`. The \"Last Move Rationale\" clarifies: `my body is at (0, 1), (0, 2)...

Moving LEFT is fatal.\n4.  **RIGHT** to `(2, 1)`: This is empty on the board and not part of my body.\n\nSince I must move, and UP is risky (moving towards enemy, potential head-on collision if they move DOWN) while RIGHT is safe and maintains distance from the enemy, I choose RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Body: [(1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)].\n*   **Board Constraints:** I am in the bottom row (y=0). My body occupies (1, 0) and (1, 1).\n*   **Immediate Moves:**\n    *   **LEFT:** Target (1, 0). This cell contains my own body segment (the neck). Moving here results in self-collision and death. **Unsafe.**\n    *   **DOWN:** Target (2, -1). This is outside the board (y < 0). **Unsafe.**\n    *   **UP:** Target (2, 1). This cell is currently empty (board shows `. . T T` at x=1-4, y=1, meaning (2,1) is `.`). Safe for now.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Target (3, 0). This cell is currently empty (board shows `. A A` at x=5-7, y=0, meaning (3,0) is `.`). Safe for now.\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves (UP vs. RIGHT):**\n*   **Enemy Context:** Enemy Snake #1 (Head at 1,3) is situated directly above me. If I move UP to (2,1) and they move DOWN to (1,2), we are at vertical distance 1. If they continue down to (1,1) and I continue up to (2,2), we could collide or put me in a position where they block me. The enemy has a long body (9 apples), and they are likely hunting.\n*   **Move UP (to 2,1):**\n    *   Pros: Faces the board's open area.\n    *   Cons: Moves closer to the enemy's head at (1,3). Opens a path to (2,2) which is \"T\" (terrain/body). I would be funneled North/East.\n*   **Move RIGHT (to 3,0):**\n    *   Pros: Moves me away from the enemy's head. Keeps me on the bottom row (y=0), which is usually a safer boundary. It opens up a cluster of apples at (4,0), (5,0), and (9,0). It avoids immediate engagement.\n    *   Cons: Limits vertical mobility initially, but for a \"long snake\" (length 8), maneuvering on the bottom row is safer than engaging a hunter vertically.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **UP** brings me closer to the enemy head and risks a head-on collision or being trapped against the wall/enemy body. Moving **RIGHT** isolates me from the immediate threat, moves me toward a cluster of apples on the bottom row, and utilizes the bottom boundary for safety.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move RIGHT to (3,0), then collect apples at (4,0), (5,0), and (9,0). Avoid the vertical cluster of enemy bodies at x=1,2.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

This is a length 8 snake.\n*   **Board Constraints:** I am on the bottom row (y=0). The cell immediately to my left (2, 0) is my own body (neck).\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (1, 2). The cell immediately below his head is (1, 1), which is occupied by my body.\n*   **Immediate Moves:**\n    *   **LEFT:** Target (2, 0). This cell contains my own body segment. **Unsafe.**\n    *   **DOWN:** Target (3, -1). This is outside the board (y < 0). **Unsafe.**\n    *   **UP:** Target (3, 1). The board shows `T` (my body or terrain) at (3, 1). Specifically, looking at my body list, I don't have a segment at (3, 1), but the board display shows `T` there in row 1. Looking closer at the board: `Row 1: T T . T ...` My body occupies `(1, 1)`. The `T` at (3, 1) in the grid likely represents my body or a wall. Wait, my body is `[(2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)...]`. So (3, 1) is not in my body list. However, the board visualization clearly marks (3, 1) as `T` (Terrain/Blocked). If I treat `T` as an obstacle, **UP is Unsafe**. *Correction*: Checking the board state from the prompt again: `Row 1: T T . T . ...`. My body is at `(2,0)`, `(1,0)`, `(1,1)`. So the `T` at `(0,1)` is my body. The `T` at `(1,1)` is my body. The `T` at `(3,1)` is **not** my body. But `T` usually implies Terrain or Body. If it's not my body, it could be an obstacle. However, usually in these grids, `T` is just a marker for body/terrain. Let's assume `T` is an obstacle. If (3, 1) is blocked, UP is unsafe.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Target (4, 0). The board shows `Row 0: ... A A ...` at x=4,5. Specifically `(4,0)` is an `A`. The cell is occupied by an apple. Apples are safe to move into (and desirable). **Safe and Optimal.**\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n*   **LEFT:** Blocked by my neck (2, 0).\n*   **DOWN:** Off the board.\n*   **UP:** If (3, 1) is indeed a `T` (obstacle/body), this is blocked. Even if it were open, moving UP brings me closer to Enemy Snake #1 (Head at 1,2) and puts me in a tighter space with my own body occupying the left side (x=0,1).\n*   **RIGHT:** Moves to (4, 0). This cell contains an apple. I grow and gain a point. It extends my length to 9. It keeps me on the bottom boundary, which is generally safer for a long snake. It sets up a path to the apple at (5, 0) next.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nRIGHT is the only valid move that is definitely safe (apple) and progresses the game. Even if UP was open, RIGHT is preferred because it collects an apple and moves away from the enemy's position.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Continue Right to collect the cluster of apples at (4,0), (5,0), and eventually (9,0). Maintain distance from Enemy #1.\n\nRIGHT\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",
