Safe.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2,5) \u2013 empty, not an apple, not off board, safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1,6) \u2013 contains an apple at (1,6). Safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,6) \u2013 my own body at (3,6) \u2192 would die. Not safe.  \n\nSo unsafe moves: RIGHT.  \nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy snake\u2019s possible moves from (4,3):**  \nEnemy head at (4,3), length 1, no body.  \nEnemy could move UP (4,4), DOWN (4,2), LEFT (3,3), RIGHT (5,3).  \nNone of these intersect with my immediate possible moves except possibly if I move DOWN to (2,5) and enemy moves \u2026 no, still far.  \nHead-on collision risk: Only if we end up in same cell. Closest: enemy moves LEFT twice? No, simultaneous move, so I check if enemy could move to (1,6) same turn I move to (1,6)? That would require enemy moving from (4,3) to (1,6) in 1 move \u2014 impossible. So no head-on risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and future options:**  \n\nLEFT (1,6) \u2192 eats apple \u2192 grow by 1 \u2192 new body segment added at head\u2019s old position (2,6) \u2192 length becomes 3.  \nPros: immediate score (2 apples total), moves toward left side apples.  \nCons: after eating, my body will occupy (2,6) and (3,6) and new head at (1,6). Then possible moves from (1,6) next turn: UP (1,7), DOWN (1,5) \u2014 apple at (1,5) there, LEFT (0,6), RIGHT back to (2,6) \u2014 but (2,6) will be my body then. So RIGHT would be suicide next turn. So future options from (1,6) after eating: UP, DOWN, LEFT safe (if not hitting enemy).  \n\nUP (2,7) \u2192 no apple, closer to apple at (3,7)? Actually (3,7) is east and up from (2,7). From (2,7) next turn: possible moves UP (2,8), DOWN back to (2,6) safe (body at (3,6)), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7) apple. So future options open.  \n\nDOWN (2,5) \u2192 no apple, but next to apple at (1,5). From (2,5) next turn: possible moves UP back to (2,6) safe, DOWN (2,4), LEFT (1,5) apple, RIGHT (3,5). Also good future options.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Avoid trapping myself:**  \nEating apple grows, which reduces future space slightly but not critically yet. Board is mostly empty.  \n\nLEFT to (1,6) eats apple and scores, but then next turn I must avoid moving RIGHT into my new body at (2,6). That\u2019s fine, still have 3 other directions likely safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nAfter eating (1,6), I could go DOWN to (1,5) to eat another apple immediately next turn if safe, or go UP/LEFT to explore. That would give 3 apples quickly.  \n\nGiven enemy is far away, scoring fast seems good.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT to eat apple at (1,6) seems best \u2014 immediate score, safe, and sets up another potential apple next turn.  \n\nLEFT",

No immediate collision risk unless we both move into same cell, which is unlikely given positions.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples to (3,3) by Manhattan distance:  \n- (3,5): distance 2  \n- (1,5): distance 2  \n- (3,7): distance 4  \n- (9,5): distance 8  \n- (8,0): distance 8  \n\nBest: (3,5) and (1,5) both distance 2.  \n\nFrom (3,3):  \n- UP (3,4): closer to (3,5) \u2192 distance 1.  \n- DOWN (3,2): farther from most apples.  \n- LEFT (2,3): closer to (1,5) \u2192 distance 1+2=3, farther from (3,5).  \n- RIGHT (4,3): farther from both closest apples.  \n\nSo UP is best for (3,5).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy threat to (3,5):**  \nEnemy at (1,6) could go DOWN to (1,5) apple, or UP/LEFT.  \nFrom (1,6) to (3,5) distance: 2+1=3.  \nFrom (3,3) to (3,5) distance: 2.  \nIf I go UP to (3,4), next turn I can go UP to (3,5) in 1 more move.  \nEnemy could reach (3,5) in 2 moves at best (e.g., (1,6)\u2192(1,5)\u2192(2,5)\u2192(3,5) is 3 moves actually; wait, check: (1,6) to (3,5) Manhattan 3, so 3 moves).

Good.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nEarly game, collect uncontested apples if possible. (3,5) is reachable before enemy, and going UP now sets me up to get it next turn if I choose.

Taking the closest apple is priority.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Check immediate death risks for each move:**  \n- UP: (3,5) apple, safe.  \n- DOWN: (3,3) safe.  \n- LEFT: (2,4) safe.  \n- RIGHT: (4,4) safe.  \n\nAll safe, but UP gets apple and doesn\u2019t risk head-on collision.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nAfter eating apple at (3,5), next turn I\u2019ll have only LEFT and RIGHT safe. Choose whichever keeps more options open and moves toward another apple (maybe (3,7) via RIGHT then UP, but careful of enemy at (1,5) possibly moving).

DOWN is suicide.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy possible moves from (1,4):**  \nEnemy body: (1,5), (1,6), (2,6).  \nFrom (1,4):  \n- UP (1,5) \u2192 own body, unsafe.  \n- DOWN (1,3) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (0,4) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (2,4) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \nEnemy at (1,4) cannot reach any of my possible head destinations in one move:  \n- (3,6): distance |3-1|+|6-4| = 2+2=4, no.  \n- (2,5): distance |2-1|+|5-4| = 1+1=2, no.  \n- (4,5): distance |4-1|+|5-4| = 3+1=4, no.  \n\nSo no head-on collision possible this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples to (3,5):  \n- (3,7): distance 2 (UP twice)  \n- (5,9): distance 6  \n- (0,8): distance 10  \n- (9,5): distance 6  \n- (8,0): distance 13  \n\nUP gets me closer to (3,7).  \nLEFT gets me closer to (0,8) but that\u2019s far.  \nRIGHT gets me closer to (5,9) or (9,5) but still far.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n\nIf I go UP to (3,6):  \nNext turn body: [(3,6),(3,5)], tail at (3,5).  \nFrom (3,6) possible moves:  \n- UP (3,7) \u2013 apple, safe unless enemy moves there this turn? Enemy at (1,4) can\u2019t reach (3,7) in 1 move.  \n- DOWN (3,5) \u2013 my body next turn, unsafe.  \n- LEFT (2,6) \u2013 enemy body currently at (2,6), but next turn enemy moves, so maybe free? Wait, enemy body at (2,6) is tail? Enemy length 4: head (1,4), body (1,5),(1,6),(2,6). If enemy moves, tail (2,6) might move if they don\u2019t eat apple. But if enemy doesn\u2019t eat, tail moves off (2,6) and that cell becomes free. So (2,6) could be free next turn.  \n- RIGHT (4,6) \u2013 empty.  \nSo UP now gives potentially 3 safe moves next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) if enemy tail vacates (2,6).  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (2,5):  \nNext turn body: [(2,5),(3,5)], tail at (3,5).  \nFrom (2,5) possible moves:  \n- UP (2,6) \u2013 enemy body currently at (2,6), but enemy tail, could vacate.  \n- DOWN (2,4) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT (1,5) \u2013 enemy body currently at (1,5), enemy tail segment? Actually (1,5) is second segment of enemy, will it move? Enemy head at (1,4), if enemy moves DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT, body shifts, (1,5) becomes (1,4) if enemy goes UP? No, enemy can\u2019t go UP into (1,5). So (1,5) will remain enemy body next turn. So unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (3,5) \u2013 my body next turn, unsafe.  \nSo only DOWN and maybe UP (if enemy tail moves) safe. That\u2019s riskier.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,5):  \nNext turn body: [(4,5),(3,5)], tail at (3,5).  \nFrom (4,5) possible moves:  \n- UP (4,6) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN (4,4) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT (3,5) \u2013 my body, unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (5,5) \u2013 empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good mobility.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy threat next turn:**  \nIf I go UP to (3,6), enemy could move to (2,4) this turn, then next turn from (2,4) to (3,4) or (2,5) etc., not directly threatening me unless I go to (3,7) and they go to (2,5) then (3,5) etc. But I can adapt.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,5), enemy could move toward center but less direct conflict.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI want to grow safely. UP gets me closer to apple (3,7) and keeps decent mobility. RIGHT gives best immediate mobility next turn but away from nearest apple.  \n\nGiven enemy is longer (4 vs my 2), I should avoid risky corridors. UP seems fine: no head-on risk, apple in 2 moves, and next turn I can go to (3,7) if clear or RIGHT/LEFT depending on enemy.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP safely moves toward apple and keeps options.\n\nUP",

Yes.  \n   - Own body? Body cells: (2,3), (1,3), (1,4). (3,4) not in those, safe.  \n   - Enemy body? Enemy body: (3,7), (3,6). Not there, safe.  \n   - Enemy head collision possible? Enemy head currently at (4,7). If enemy moves left to (3,7), that\u2019s not (3,4). If enemy moves down to (4,6), not (3,4). Only way for enemy to reach (3,4) this turn is if enemy moves: from (4,7) to (3,7) (left), then no. Wait, enemy can\u2019t reach (3,4) in one move from (4,7). So no head-on collision possible this turn.  \n   - Safe.\n\n2. **DOWN (3,2)** \u2013 Check:  \n   - In bounds? Yes.  \n   - Own body? No.  \n   - Enemy body? No.  \n   - Enemy head collision? Enemy from (4,7) to (3,7), (5,7), (4,8), (4,6). None is (3,2). Safe.\n\n3. **LEFT (2,3)** \u2013 Check:  \n   - In bounds? Yes.  \n   - Own body? Body cells: (2,3) is second segment of my snake (currently behind head). Moving LEFT from (3,3) to (2,3) is moving directly backwards into my own body segment? Wait: my body list is [(2,3), (1,3), (1,4)]. The first body segment after head is (2,3). That\u2019s the cell directly behind my head (since last move was RIGHT into (3,3), previous head was (2,3)). So moving LEFT goes back into the cell my neck occupies \u2192 suicide by rule: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"  \n   - Eliminate LEFT.\n\n4. **RIGHT (4,3)** \u2013 Check:  \n   - In bounds? Yes.  \n   - Own body? No.  \n   - Enemy body? No.  \n   - Enemy head collision possible? Enemy at (4,7) moves DOWN to (4,6) not (4,3). Moves LEFT to (3,7) no. UP to (4,8) no. RIGHT to (5,7) no. So no possible head-on collision. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. LEFT is suicide.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Choose among UP, DOWN, RIGHT.**\n\n**Apples:**  \n- (8,0) \u2013 far, not urgent.  \n- (9,5) \u2013 far.  \n- (5,9) \u2013 far.  \n- (0,8) \u2013 far.  \n- (8,4) \u2013 closer in x, but y=4 vs my y=3.\n\nFrom (3,3):  \n- UP (3,4) gets closer to (8,4)? Actually (8,4) is x=8, y=4, so moving UP gets y=4, then need to go right 5 steps.  \n- RIGHT (4,3) keeps y=3, still need y=1 up later to get (8,4).  \n- DOWN (3,2) away from most apples.\n\nAlso consider future safe moves:  \nFrom (3,4): possible next moves? Check surroundings:  \n- Up to (3,5): free.  \n- Down to (3,3): free (current head pos, but will be empty after move except if tail moves? Tail is (1,4) will move when we move? Actually snake moves: head moves to new cell, each body segment shifts forward, tail cell vacates unless apple eaten. No apple eaten this turn, so tail (1,4) vacates. So (3,3) will be neck, not free next turn? Wait: after moving UP to (3,4), body becomes: head (3,4), then (3,3), (2,3), (1,3) \u2014 tail (1,4) gone. So (3,3) occupied by my neck next turn, so can\u2019t go back DOWN from (3,4). That\u2019s fine. From (3,4), left to (2,4) free? Yes. Right to (4,4) free? Yes. So 3 possible moves next turn.\n\nFrom (4,3): possible next moves? Up (4,4) free, Down (4,2) free, Right (5,3) free, Left (3,3) occupied by my neck next turn (since body shifts). So 3 possible moves.\n\nFrom (3,2): Up (3,3) occupied by neck next turn, Down (3,1) free, Left (2,2) free, Right (4,2) free \u2192 3 possible moves.\n\nAll similar in future mobility.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy snake at (4,7)** likely going for apple at (5,9) or (0,8)? Not sure. He might move up to (4,8) toward (0,8)? Actually (0,8) is far left, so maybe left toward (3,7)? But (3,7) is his body. He can\u2019t go there. So his safe moves from (4,7): Up (4,8) free, Down (4,6) free, Right (5,7) free, Left (3,7) his own body (suicide). So he won\u2019t go left. So he\u2019ll likely go Up, Down, or Right.\n\nNo immediate collision threat to my choices.\n\n---\n\n**Closest apple** in Manhattan distance:  \n(8,4): dist |8-3|+|4-3| = 5+1=6  \n(5,9): |5-3|+|9-3|=2+6=8  \n(0,8): 3+5=8  \n(9,5): 6+2=8  \n(8,0): 5+3=8\n\nActually (8,4) is closest.\n\nFrom (3,3):  \n- UP to (3,4): dist to (8,4) = 5+0=5 (improved by 1)  \n- RIGHT to (4,3): dist to (8,4) = 4+1=5 (improved by 1)  \n- DOWN to (3,2): dist = 5+2=7 (worse)\n\nSo UP and RIGHT both improve equally toward closest apple.\n\n---\n\n**Tie-breaker:** Looking at board, if I go UP to (3,4), next turn I can go RIGHT toward apple along y=4. If I go RIGHT to (4,3), next turn I can go UP to (4,4) then right. Both fine. But going UP now gets me to y=4 which is same y as apple, so future path might be simpler.\n\nAlso, consider enemy: if enemy goes down to (4,6), he\u2019s far from me. If he goes right to (5,7), still far. No threat.\n\nI\u2019ll choose **UP** to get aligned with apple\u2019s y.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (3,4), move RIGHT toward apple at (8,4) while avoiding possible future enemy movements. Keep an eye on snake #1\u2019s position for collision risks.\n\n---\n\nUP",

Safe.  \n\nNo immediate head-on risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples to (4,8):  \n- (5,9) distance 2  \n- (0,8) distance 4  \n- (8,4) distance 8  \n- (9,5) distance 10  \n- (8,0) distance 12  \n\n(5,9) is closest.

Wait: body will be [(3,8),(4,8),(4,7)], so (3,7) is empty next turn? Let\u2019s check: current body: (4,8),(4,7),(3,7). After moving LEFT to (3,8), new body: (3,8),(4,8),(4,7). So (3,7) is free next turn. Actually (3,7) is not in new body, so DOWN to (3,7) is safe next turn.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,8): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,8): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,8):  \nBody next turn: [(5,8), (4,8), (4,7)]  \nFrom (5,8) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (5,9): apple \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,7): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,8): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,8): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk assessment:**  \nEnemy at (3,4) can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (4,4), still 4 steps away from me if I\u2019m at (4,9) or (5,8).  \nIf enemy goes UP to (3,5), still far.  \nNo immediate threat, but enemy is longer (4 vs 3), so avoid getting close.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI want apples to catch up. (5,9) is closest. UP gets me adjacent to it, but reduces immediate safe moves next turn to 2 (though one is eating apple).  \nLEFT gives good mobility but moves away from closest apple.  \nRIGHT gives good mobility and moves toward center/right apples later.  \n\nGiven enemy is at (3,4), moving LEFT toward (0,8) might be safe but puts me near top-left corner eventually.  \nUP to (4,9) then RIGHT to (5,9) next turn eats apple and grows to length 4, matching enemy length. That seems strong.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go UP now, next turn I can go RIGHT to eat (5,9) and grow. Need to check if enemy could reach (5,9) next turn: enemy at (3,4) \u2192 in two moves can reach (5,9)? Possibly if enemy goes UP twice and RIGHT twice, but not in one move.

Enemy head at (4,9) could move DOWN to (4,8) or other directions, not to (4,5) this turn. So no direct head-on risk.  \n   - Safe.  \n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (4,3)  \n   - Within board: yes (y=3).  \n   - In my body? My body: (3,4), (3,3), (2,3) \u2192 (4,3) is not in that list.  \n   - Not in enemy body.  \n   - Safe from head-on?

My body: (3,4) is directly behind my head \u2192 moving LEFT would go into the cell my neck occupies.

So enemy could move RIGHT to (5,9) \u2014 not (5,4). No risk.  \n   - Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apples and future options.**  \n\n- **UP (4,5)**:  \n  - No apple there.  \n  - Future moves from (4,5): UP to (4,6), DOWN back to (4,4) (occupied by my neck next turn if I move), LEFT (3,5), RIGHT (5,5).  \n  - From (4,5), I\u2019m closer to apple at (5,9) (distance 4) than from (4,4).  \n  - Avoids potential enemy movement from (4,9) \u2014 they\u2019re far away.  \n\n- **DOWN (4,3)**:  \n  - No apple there.  \n  - Future moves from (4,3): UP back to (4,4), DOWN to (4,2), LEFT (3,3) (my body currently at (3,3) but will move forward next turn so maybe free), RIGHT (5,3).  \n  - Moves me away from most apples except maybe (8,0) long term.  \n\n- **RIGHT (5,4)**:  \n  - No apple there.  \n  - Future moves from (5,4): UP (5,5), DOWN (5,3), LEFT back to (4,4), RIGHT (6,4).  \n  - Moves me closer to apple (8,4) and (9,5).  \n\nClosest apple to my head currently:  \n- (8,4) distance |4-8|+|4-4|=4  \n- (5,9) distance |4-5|+|4-9|=1+5=6  \n- (0,8) distance 4+4=8  \n- (9,5) distance 5+1=6  \n- (8,0) distance 4+4=8  \n\nSo (8,4) is closest at Manhattan distance 4.  \n\nMoving RIGHT gets me closer to (8,4) (distance 3 after move).  \nUP gets me slightly closer to (5,9) (distance 5 after move) but farther from (8,4).  \n\nGiven I have 3 apples vs enemy\u2019s 2, I should prioritize safety and steady growth.  \n\n**Step 3: Consider enemy movement and collision risk.**  \nEnemy at (4,9) can move DOWN to (4,8), LEFT to (3,9), RIGHT to (5,9).  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (5,9), that\u2019s far from me.  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (4,8), still far.  \nNo immediate collision risk for me in any safe move.  \n\n**Step 4: Future flexibility.**  \nFrom (5,4) (RIGHT), I\u2019ll have 3 possible moves next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) because LEFT goes back to (4,4) which will be empty (my neck moves).  \nFrom (4,5) (UP), I\u2019ll have 3 moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) because DOWN goes to (4,4) empty.  \nFrom (4,3) (DOWN), I\u2019ll have 3 moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) because UP goes to (4,4) empty.  \n\nAll give similar flexibility.  \n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan note.**  \nI want to path toward (8,4) or (9,5) while keeping distance from enemy. The enemy is far north, so moving RIGHT is safe and progresses toward closest apple.  \n\n**Final choice:**  \nRIGHT  \n\nRIGHT",

Wait \u2014 that apple is at (2,3). My current body occupies (3,3) and (3,4), (4,4). After I move, my body will shift: head to new position, then (5,4) becomes new neck, (4,4) becomes second segment, (3,4) becomes third, (3,3) becomes tail. So (2,3) will be adjacent to my tail next turn? Let\u2019s check:  \nIf I go DOWN to (5,3), next turn my body will be: head (5,3), neck (5,4), then (4,4), then (3,4), tail (3,3). So (2,3) is free next turn and adjacent to my tail (3,3) \u2014 but to eat (2,3) I\u2019d need to go LEFT twice from (5,3), which passes through (4,3) and (3,3) \u2014 but (3,3) will be my tail next turn, so moving to (3,3) would be safe if tail moves away. However, that\u2019s a bit convoluted.  \n\nRIGHT toward (8,4) seems more straightforward, open space on right side.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Future flexibility**  \n\nFrom (6,4): possible moves next turn: UP (6,5), DOWN (6,3), RIGHT (7,4), LEFT back to (5,4) (empty next turn). 3 options.  \nFrom (5,5): UP (5,6), DOWN (5,4) empty, LEFT (4,5), RIGHT (6,5). 4 options actually? Wait, check: DOWN to (5,4) will be empty (my neck moves), so yes, 4 options. More flexible.  \nFrom (5,3): UP (5,4) empty, DOWN (5,2), LEFT (4,3), RIGHT (6,3). Also 4 options.  \n\nSo UP and DOWN give slightly more options next turn than RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Long-term planning**  \n\nI have 3 apples, enemy has 3 apples \u2014 tied. I want to survive and collect apples safely. (8,4) is close and board right side is fairly open. Moving RIGHT progresses toward it while staying away from enemy who\u2019s north.  \n\nBut UP gives more future options and avoids going too close to bottom where (8,0) is far anyway. UP also keeps me central.  \n\nI think UP is safest for maintaining options, but RIGHT is more direct toward nearest apple. Let\u2019s see if RIGHT has any hidden danger:  \nFrom (6,4), next turn if I go RIGHT again to (7,4), I\u2019m closer to apple (8,4). That seems fine.  \n\nActually, apple at (8,4) is two steps right and zero vertical from (6,4). That\u2019s efficient.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nI\u2019ll go **RIGHT** to head toward (8,4) efficiently while keeping safe distance from enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,4), assess if RIGHT again is safe toward (8,4), but also check enemy\u2019s new position. If enemy moves toward me, maybe go UP/DOWN to avoid. Priority: eat (8,4) safely.  \n\nRIGHT",

Eating it next turn if I go RIGHT now is possible unless enemy blocks. But enemy is far away (at least 4 steps).  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,4), next turn I could go RIGHT to (8,4) to eat apple, unless that cell becomes dangerous. Checking: enemy could be at (6,8) \u2192 moves DOWN to (6,7), LEFT to (5,8), RIGHT to (7,8), UP to (6,9). So enemy cannot reach (8,4) in one move from any safe move they make this turn. So eating (8,4) next turn seems safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Long-term plan note for next turn**  \n\nIf I go RIGHT now to (7,4):  \nNext turn, apple (8,4) is adjacent. Check if moving RIGHT to (8,4) is safe:  \n- Not off board.  \n- Not into my own body (tail will be at (4,4) then).  \n- Not into enemy body (enemy tail at (4,8) then).  \n- Avoid head-on: predict enemy\u2019s move from their new head position. Likely safe.  \n\nIf for some reason (8,4) seems risky next turn, I could go UP/DOWN from (7,4) to stay safe and approach other apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nGoing RIGHT puts me one step from apple (8,4) with a safe path and keeps options open.  \n\nRIGHT",

Yes (y=6).  \n   - Into own body? No. Body cells: (8,4),(7,4),(6,4),(5,4).  \n   - Into enemy body? Enemy body: (4,7),(5,7),(5,8). No.  \n   - Safe.  \n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (8,4)  \n   - Within board? Yes (y=4).  \n   - Into own body? Yes, (8,4) is the first body segment (the neck). Immediate death.  \n   - Eliminated.  \n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (7,5)  \n   - Within board? Yes (x=7).  \n   - Into own body? No.  \n   - Into enemy body? No.  \n   - Safe.  \n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,5)  \n   - Within board? Yes (x=9).  \n   - Into own body? No.  \n   - Into enemy body? No.  \n   - But there\u2019s an apple at (9,5). Eating it would grow after moving, so head collision check is before growth.  \n   - Safe.  \n\n**Check for possible head-on collisions with enemy snake #1 this turn:**  \nEnemy head at (4,6). Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP to (4,7) \u2192 into its own body (its neck) \u2192 not possible (suicide).  \n- DOWN to (4,5) \u2192 safe for them.  \n- LEFT to (3,6) \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT to (5,6) \u2192 safe.  \n\nNo overlap with my possible destinations (8,6), (7,5), (9,5) except if enemy goes RIGHT to (5,6) \u2014 not a conflict.  \nSo no direct head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n- (9,5) is 1 step away (RIGHT).  \n- (8,0) is 5 steps away.  \n- (2,3) and (2,4) are far.  \n- (0,8) is far.  \n\n**Future safety after each safe move:**  \n\n- **RIGHT to (9,5)**: Eats apple, grows to length 6. Next turn head at (9,5), body adds new tail at old tail (5,4)? Wait, growth: new tail duplicates last segment before moving? Actually in Snake, after eating, you grow by not removing the tail segment at end of turn. So after moving to (9,5), the tail (5,4) stays, body becomes: (9,5),(8,5),(8,4),(7,4),(6,4),(5,4).  \n\nNext turn from (9,5):  \n   - UP (9,6) safe unless enemy there (enemy at (4,6) now, could move but unlikely).  \n   - DOWN (9,4) safe? Own body at (8,4) and (9,5) is head, (9,4) is free now.  \n   - LEFT (8,5) safe? That\u2019s the current head position, but next turn body: (8,5) is second segment, so moving LEFT into (8,5) would hit own body \u2014 fatal. So LEFT not safe next turn.  \n   - RIGHT off board \u2192 not safe.  \n   So from (9,5) only UP and DOWN would be safe next turn (2 options). Risky corner.  \n\n- **UP to (8,6)**: No apple. Next turn from (8,6):  \n   Possible moves: UP (8,7), DOWN (8,5), LEFT (7,6), RIGHT (9,6). All 4 might be safe depending on body. Body then: (8,6),(8,5),(8,4),(7,4),(6,4) \u2014 tail (5,4) removed.  \n   Check: DOWN to (8,5) \u2014 (8,5) is second segment next turn, so fatal. So actually DOWN not safe.  \n   Wait, recalc: After UP to (8,6), body: head (8,6), then (8,5),(8,4),(7,4),(6,4). So (8,5) is occupied. So DOWN to (8,5) is fatal. So safe next moves from (8,6): UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n- **LEFT to (7,5)**: No apple. Body: (7,5),(8,5),(8,4),(7,4),(6,4). Next turn from (7,5):  \n   UP (7,6), DOWN (7,4), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5).  \n   DOWN (7,4) is own body (third segment) \u2192 fatal.  \n   RIGHT (8,5) is own body (second segment) \u2192 fatal.  \n   So only UP and LEFT safe (2 options).  \n\n**Comparison:**  \n- RIGHT: gets apple, but next turn only 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN), cornered.  \n- UP: no apple, but 3 safe moves next turn, keeps flexibility, moves toward center/open space.  \n- LEFT: no apple, only 2 safe moves next turn, less flexible.  \n\nGiven we already have a lead (4 vs 3 apples), safety and maintaining options is better than risky apple grab. UP is safest for future flexibility.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,6), consider moving toward (0,8) or (2,3) apples gradually while avoiding boxing self. Monitor enemy movement; enemy may go for (2,3) or (2,4).  \n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP",

Yes.  \n   - Own body? No, body cells: (8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4).  \n   - Enemy body? Enemy body: (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7) \u2013 no overlap.  \n   - Safe.  \n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (8, 5)  \n   - Within board? Yes.  \n   - Own body? Yes, (8, 5) is my neck (first body segment). Death.  \n   - Eliminated.  \n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (7, 6)  \n   - Within board? Yes.  \n   - Own body? No.  \n   - Enemy body? No.  \n   - Safe.  \n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (9, 6)  \n   - Within board? Yes.  \n   - Own body? No.  \n   - Enemy body? No.  \n   - Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Check for possible head-on collisions with enemy snake #1 this turn:**  \n\nEnemy head at (4, 5). Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP to (4, 6) \u2192 into its own body (neck) \u2192 suicide \u2192 unlikely.  \n- DOWN to (4, 4) \u2192 safe for them.  \n- LEFT to (3, 5) \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT to (5, 5) \u2192 safe.  \n\nNone of my safe destinations (8, 7), (7, 6), (9, 6) overlap with enemy\u2019s possible destinations (4, 4), (3, 5), (5, 5). No risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \n- (9, 5) is 1 step away if I go RIGHT then DOWN next turn, but not directly reachable now.  \n- (8, 0) is far.  \n- (2, 3) and (2, 4) are far.  \n- (0, 8) is far.  \n\nNo apple in my immediate move squares.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move:**  \n\n**UP to (8, 7):**  \nBody becomes: (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4) \u2013 tail (6, 4) removed.  \nNext turn from (8, 7):  \n- UP (8, 8) \u2013 free.  \n- DOWN (8, 6) \u2013 own body (second segment) \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT (7, 7) \u2013 free.  \n- RIGHT (9, 7) \u2013 free.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**LEFT to (7, 6):**  \nBody: (7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4) \u2013 tail (6, 4) removed.  \nNext turn from (7, 6):  \n- UP (7, 7) \u2013 free.  \n- DOWN (7, 5) \u2013 free? Check body: (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4) \u2013 (7, 5) is free.  \n- LEFT (6, 6) \u2013 free.  \n- RIGHT (8, 6) \u2013 own body (second segment) \u2192 death.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**RIGHT to (9, 6):**  \nBody: (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4) \u2013 tail (6, 4) removed.  \nNext turn from (9, 6):  \n- UP (9, 7) \u2013 free.  \n- DOWN (9, 5) \u2013 free (apple there).  \n- LEFT (8, 6) \u2013 own body (second segment) \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT off board \u2192 death.  \nSo only 2 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN), cornered at right edge.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Compare:**  \nRIGHT traps me on the right edge with fewer options next turn.  \nUP and LEFT both give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \n- I have a 4\u20133 apple lead.  \n- Avoid risky corners.  \n- UP moves toward center/open rows, possibly toward apple (0, 8) eventually.  \n- LEFT moves toward center too, but currently no apple nearby.  \n- Enemy is at (4, 5), might go for (2, 3) or (2, 4) apples soon, but I\u2019m far.  \n\nBetter to keep flexibility.

Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP to (4, 5) \u2192 own body \u2192 suicide \u2192 unlikely.  \n- DOWN to (4, 3) \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT to (3, 4) \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT to (5, 4) \u2192 safe.  \n\nMy possible destinations: (8, 8), (7, 7), (9, 7).  \nNo overlap with enemy\u2019s possible moves.  \nNo immediate head-on risk.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple is (9, 5) \u2014 from my head (8, 7), that\u2019s 2 steps away (DOWN twice or RIGHT+DOWN).  \n(0, 8), (2, 3), (2, 4), (8, 0) are far.  \nNo apple in immediate move squares except maybe next turn if I go RIGHT then DOWN to (9, 6) \u2192 (9, 5).  \nBut RIGHT now puts me at (9, 7) or (9, 6)?

Avoid trapping myself.  \nEnemy at (4, 4) might go for apples at (2, 3) or (2, 4).  \nI should aim for apple at (9, 5) soon, but not at cost of getting cornered.  \nIf I go UP now, next turn from (8, 8) I could go LEFT toward center, or RIGHT then later DOWN toward apple (9, 5).  \nIf I go LEFT now to (7, 7), I\u2019m more central but farther from (9, 5).  \n\nGiven my lead, staying flexible is key. UP keeps more board space above open. LEFT moves toward center but not toward any apple.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nBoth UP and LEFT are safe with same future flexibility. UP is slightly better because it leaves option to go RIGHT next turn to start approaching (9, 5) while staying safe.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP",

Not safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \n\nEnemy head at (2,2) can move:  \n- UP (2,3) \u2192 occupied by its own body \u2192 suicide.  \n- DOWN (2,1) \u2192 free.  \n- LEFT (1,2) \u2192 free.  \n- RIGHT (3,2) \u2192 free.  \n\nMy possible destinations: (5,9), (5,7), (4,8).  \nDo any match enemy\u2019s possible moves (2,1), (1,2), (3,2)? No. So no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \n\nClosest apples:  \n- (7,9) \u2013 2 steps away (right 2, up 1).  \n- (0,8) \u2013 5 steps left.  \n- (9,3) \u2013 far.  \n- (9,5) \u2013 far.  \n- (8,0) \u2013 far.  \n\nFrom (5,8):  \n- UP (5,9): next step to (6,9) gets closer to (7,9).  \n- DOWN (5,7): away from most apples except maybe (8,0) long-term.  \n- LEFT (4,8): toward (0,8) but still far.  \n\nApple (7,9) is tempting but going UP now might trap me in top row.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each move:**  \n\n**UP to (5,9):**  \nNext turn from (5,9):  \n- UP \u2192 out of bounds (y=10).  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,8) my old head position? No, body will be [(5,9), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7)] so (5,8) is free? Wait, my body after moving UP: head (5,9), then (5,8) is not in body? Actually, my current body is [(6,8),(7,8),(8,8),(8,7)]. After moving UP without eating apple, my new body is [(5,9), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8)]? That\u2019s wrong \u2014 tail disappears? No, I didn\u2019t eat apple, so length stays same: head moves to (5,9), body becomes [(5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8)], tail (8,7) disappears. So (5,8) is now body segment.  \n\nSo from (5,9) next turn:  \nUP (5,10) \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN (5,8) \u2192 my own body \u2192 suicide.  \nLEFT (4,9) \u2192 free.  \nRIGHT (6,9) \u2192 free.  \nOnly 2 safe moves.

DOWN (5,7) also okay but moves away from apples.  \nGiven enemy has 5 apples vs my 4, I need to close gap, but safely. LEFT seems best \u2014 opens path to left side apples while keeping options next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** LEFT  \n\nPlan for next turn: From (4,8), consider moving DOWN/LEFT/UP to avoid trapping, continue toward apple (0,8) or (7,9) later. Avoid moving right into body.\n\nLEFT",

Not safe.  \nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \nEnemy head at (3,1) can safely move to (3,2), (3,0), (4,1). Our possible destinations (3,9), (3,7), (2,8) do not overlap. No immediate head-on risk.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple is (0,8) at Manhattan distance 3.  \n- UP (3,9): distance to (0,8) increases to 4, but moves closer to (7,9) (distance 4).  \n- DOWN (3,7): distances to both (0,8) and (7,9) increase.  \n- LEFT (2,8): distance to (0,8) decreases to 2, moving directly toward it.  \nLEFT best for apple collection.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after move (no apple eaten this turn):**  \n- UP to (3,9): next turn only LEFT and RIGHT safe (UP off board, DOWN into body). Restrictive.  \n- DOWN to (3,7): next turn DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT safe (UP into body). Good flexibility.  \n- LEFT to (2,8): next turn UP, DOWN, LEFT safe (RIGHT into body).

LEFT progresses toward the nearest apple (0,8) while keeping multiple escape routes open. Moving DOWN drifts away from apples. UP offers a path to (7,9) but at the cost of reduced mobility. Consistent with previous plan to move left toward (0,8).\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (2,8), continue moving left toward (0,8) if safe, checking enemy movements and avoiding traps near the left edge.

Safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 7): in bounds, empty. Safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 8): in bounds, currently has apple A at (0, 8). Not occupied by any snake body. Safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 8): occupied by own body (neck). Not safe.  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \n\nEnemy head is at (5, 1).  \nPossible enemy moves:  \n- UP to (5, 2) \u2014 empty? Board shows (5, 2) is empty.  \n- DOWN to (5, 0) \u2014 empty.  \n- LEFT to (4, 1) \u2014 occupied by enemy body (4, 1). Not safe for them.  \n- RIGHT to (6, 1) \u2014 empty.  \n\nOur possible destinations:  \nUP (1, 9), DOWN (1, 7), LEFT (0, 8).  \nNone of these overlap with enemy possible moves this turn. No immediate head-on risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \n\nApples: (8, 0), (9, 5), (0, 8), (7, 9), (9, 3).  \nFrom head (1, 8):  \n- (0, 8) distance 1 (Manhattan) \u2192 LEFT.  \n- (7, 9) distance 7.  \n- (9, 5) distance 11.  \n- (8, 0) distance 15.  \n- (9, 3) distance 13.  \n\nClosest is (0, 8) \u2014 LEFT moves directly onto it.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after move:**  \n\nIf LEFT to (0, 8): eat apple, length grows by 1, so next turn tail stays in place (doesn\u2019t move).  \nBody next turn: head at (0, 8), body segments at (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8).  \nFrom (0, 8), possible moves:  \n- UP (0, 9): empty, safe.  \n- DOWN (0, 7): empty, safe.  \n- LEFT off board \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT (1, 8): occupied by own body next turn. Not safe.  \n\nSo after eating apple at left edge, only UP and DOWN are safe next turn \u2014 risky because only 2 options.  \n\nIf DOWN to (1, 7):  \nFrom (1, 7), next turn moves:  \nUP back to (1, 8) \u2014 occupied by body? Wait: body will be [(1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8)] \u2014 tail at (5, 8) moves away (since no apple eaten).  \nSo (1, 8) will be occupied by body next turn (second segment). So UP not safe.  \nDOWN to (1, 6) empty.  \nLEFT to (0, 7) empty.  \nRIGHT to (2, 7) empty.  \nSo safe moves next turn: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 3 options.  \n\nIf UP to (1, 9):  \nFrom (1, 9), next turn moves:  \nUP off board \u2192 no.  \nDOWN to (1, 8) occupied by body (since body shifts).  \nLEFT to (0, 9) empty.  \nRIGHT to (2, 9) empty.  \nSo safe: LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 only 2 options.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Score situation:**  \n\nWe have 4 apples, enemy has 5. Eating (0, 8) ties score at 5\u20135 and grows length.  \nBut eating it now means next turn we\u2019re at left edge with only 2 safe moves \u2014 could be dangerous if enemy heads toward us.  \n\nEnemy is far away at (5, 1), can\u2019t reach us next turn, but could box us later.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk vs. reward:**  \n\nEating apple now is tempting, but being trapped at left edge with only UP/DOWN could lead to death soon after.  \nMaybe better to leave apple for now, keep flexibility, come back later?  \n\nBut if we don\u2019t eat it, enemy could get it later. However enemy is far, maybe 5+ turns away.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Alternative plan:**  \n\nDOWN to (1, 7) keeps more options open, moves toward center, avoids trapping at edge.  \nWe can still get apple (0, 8) later from (0, 7) or (0, 9) approach.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decide:**  \n\nLEFT: high reward (apple + tie score), but high risk next turn.  \nDOWN: medium reward (no apple), but safer future options.  \nUP: fewer future options.  \n\nGiven survival is key, DOWN seems safest while keeping apple (0, 8) reachable next turn via (0, 7) \u2192 then UP to (0, 8) if safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (1, 7), consider going LEFT to (0, 7) next turn, then UP to (0, 8) to eat apple if enemy not near. Keep eye on enemy\u2019s path toward other apples. Avoid getting trapped at edges.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

But (0, 8) is safe now (empty).  \n- DOWN to (0, 6): empty, safe.  \n- LEFT off board \u2192 no.  \n- RIGHT to (1, 7): occupied by own body next turn \u2192 not safe.  \n\nSo next turn safe options: UP (to apple), DOWN. Only 2 safe moves, and UP eats apple but then next turn after that we\u2019re at (0, 8) with only DOWN (0, 7) safe? Let\u2019s check: after eating apple at (0, 8), length grows, so tail stays at (4, 8), body: head (0, 8), then (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8). From (0, 8): UP off board, DOWN to (0, 7) occupied by body, LEFT off board, RIGHT to (1, 8) occupied by body \u2192 trapped! That\u2019s instant death next turn.  \nSo eating apple (0, 8) from left side is fatal unless we can escape before eating it \u2014 but we can\u2019t escape after eating it. So maybe avoid eating (0, 8) until we approach from above or right.\n\nSo LEFT to (0, 7) is safe this turn, but if we go UP next turn to eat apple, we die the turn after. So maybe don\u2019t eat it yet.\n\n---\n\n**DOWN to (1, 6):**  \nNext turn body: head (1, 6), then (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), tail (4, 8) moves off.  \nFrom (1, 6):  \n- UP to (1, 7): occupied by body \u2192 not safe.  \n- DOWN to (1, 5): empty, safe.  \n- LEFT to (0, 6): empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT to (2, 6): empty, safe.  \n\n3 safe moves next turn \u2014 good flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**RIGHT to (2, 7):**  \nNext turn body: head (2, 7), then (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), tail (4, 8) moves off.  \nFrom (2, 7):  \n- UP to (2, 8): occupied by body \u2192 not safe.  \n- DOWN to (2, 6): empty, safe.  \n- LEFT to (1, 7): occupied by body \u2192 not safe.  \n- RIGHT to (3, 7): empty, safe.  \n\nOnly 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT). Less flexible.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Score and long-term**  \nWe have 4 apples, enemy has 5. Apple at (0, 8) is tempting but deadly if eaten from left edge unless we approach from above (0, 9) or right (1, 8) \u2014 but (1, 8) is our body now. So maybe get it later by going (0, 7) \u2192 (0, 8) only if we can then move RIGHT to (1, 8) \u2014 but that\u2019s occupied unless tail moves. Too risky now.\n\nBetter to stay flexible, avoid trapping self.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose safest with future options**  \nBetween DOWN (3 next moves) and LEFT (2 next moves if we avoid apple, but if we go LEFT now, we might be forced toward apple danger), DOWN seems better for survival. RIGHT only 2 safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (1, 6), consider moving LEFT toward center or DOWN to open space. Keep apple (0, 8) in mind but approach from (0, 9) or (1, 8) later if possible. Monitor enemy movement from (6, 1) \u2014 they may go for apples at (9, 5) or (9, 3).

They are far from us now.  \n\nBest to stay in central/open area, keep options open.  \nDOWN or RIGHT give more flexibility next turn. LEFT reduces options and edges toward potential trap.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose**  \nBoth DOWN and RIGHT give 3 safe moves next turn.  \nRIGHT moves toward center, DOWN moves toward bottom but still open.  \nSlight preference for RIGHT to stay more central and avoid bottom edge early.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (2, 6), consider moving toward center (RIGHT again or DOWN) to keep space.

No immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is (8, 0) directly below me.  \nIf I go DOWN now, I eat it and grow to length 7.  \nFrom (8, 0) after eating (so tail stays at (3, 1) for now), next turn body: [(8, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1)].  \n\nCheck safety after eating (8, 0):  \nFrom (8, 0):  \n- UP \u2192 (8, 1): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 0): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 0): empty.  \nOnly 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT). That\u2019s risky \u2014 could trap me in bottom row.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Consider alternative moves:**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 1):  \nNext turn body: [(9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1)] (tail (3, 1) disappears).  \nFrom (9, 1):  \n- UP \u2192 (9, 2): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 0): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 1): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nSafe moves: UP, DOWN (2 options). Also limited, but DOWN next turn gets apple (9, 0)? No, apple is at (8, 0), not (9, 0). So RIGHT now delays apple.  \n\nIf I go UP to (8, 2):  \nNext turn body: [(8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1)] (tail (3, 1) disappears).  \nFrom (8, 2):  \n- UP \u2192 (8, 3): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 1): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 2): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 2): empty.  \nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options). Good mobility, but moves away from closest apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of eating apple now vs later:**  \nIf I eat apple now (DOWN), I grow but next turn only 2 moves, possibly cornered.  \nIf I go UP now, I keep mobility high, but apple (8, 0) remains \u2014 enemy could take it if they move toward it, but they are far.  \nIf I go RIGHT now, I reduce mobility next turn and still don\u2019t get apple.  \n\nActually, check: from (8, 1), DOWN to (8, 0) is safe and gets apple. After eating, my body occupies (8, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1).  \nFrom (8, 0), LEFT to (7, 0) is safe, RIGHT to (9, 0) is safe. That\u2019s not too bad \u2014 I can go LEFT then up from (7, 0) later.  \n\nBut going LEFT from (8, 0) to (7, 0) then next turn from (7, 0):  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 1): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 0): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 0): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nOnly 1 safe move (LEFT) \u2014 that\u2019s a trap! So eating apple now could force me into a path with 1 safe move soon.  \n\nBetter to avoid that trap.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP gives best mobility (3 options next turn).  \nI can target apple (9, 3) or (9, 5) later from a safer path.  \nEnemy is far, no immediate danger.  \nAvoid cornering myself by eating (8, 0) now.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (8, 2), consider moving toward (9, 3) via RIGHT then UP, or go LEFT to center for more space. Keep options open.  \n\nUP",

Next, consider UP toward (7, 9) or DOWN toward (9, 5) based on enemy movement. Monitor enemy #1 and avoid trapping on edges.

That\u2019s risky \u2014 could get trapped if enemy approaches later.  \n\n**If UP to (8, 4):**  \nBody: [(8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1)] (tail (5, 1) disappears).  \nFrom (8, 4):  \n- UP \u2192 (8, 5): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 3): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 4): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 4): empty.  \n3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Good mobility.  \n\n**If LEFT to (7, 3):**  \nBody: [(7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1)] (tail (5, 1) disappears).  \nFrom (7, 3):  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 4): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 2): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 3): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 3): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Good mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision with enemy:**  \nEnemy at (3, 7) is far. No overlap in possible head positions this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT gives immediate apple but reduces next turn\u2019s safe moves to 2, which is dangerous.  \nUP or LEFT keep mobility high.  \nApple (9, 3) is tempting, but I have a lead (5 vs 4 apples), so I can prioritize safety.  \n\nFrom (8, 4) next turn, I can still consider moving RIGHT to (9, 4) and then DOWN to (9, 3) if apple remains, but enemy could take it. However, enemy is far from (9, 3) currently.  \n\nActually, let\u2019s check: enemy at (3, 7) to (9, 3) is 6 steps away Manhattan distance. I can reach it in 2 steps from (8, 3) via RIGHT then DOWN if I go UP now? Wait, from (8, 4) next turn, to (9, 3) is RIGHT then DOWN (two moves). But apple might be gone if enemy moves toward it? Unlikely in 2 turns given enemy\u2019s position.  \n\nBut going UP now keeps options open and is safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (8, 4), consider moving RIGHT to (9, 4) then DOWN to (9, 3) if apple still there, or go toward (9, 5) or (7, 9). Keep mobility high, avoid trapping myself on right edge.  \n\nUP",

Monitor enemy movement \u2014 if enemy moves toward (1,9), that\u2019s far from me. Avoid right edge to keep mobility. If (7,9) gets taken before I reach it, maybe target (9,5) later via safe path.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

Eating it would grow me to length 7, adding segment at tail after move.  \nOther apples: (9, 5) is 5 steps away, (9, 3) is 6 steps, (1, 9) is far, (8, 0) is far and blocked by my vertical body at x=8.  \n\nUP to (7, 9) gets apple immediately.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Check safety of UP:**  \nWill I die from enemy head-on collision? Enemy at (0, 6) cannot reach (7, 9) in one move.  \nWill I run into enemy body? No, enemy body is at (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8). (7,9) is free.  \nWill I hit my own body? My body is at (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4). (7,9) is free.  \n\nUP is safe this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Next turn considerations after eating apple:**  \nIf I go UP to (7, 9) and eat apple, my new head is (7, 9), my body becomes:  \n[(8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4)] + tail stays until next move? Actually, growth means after moving to apple, tail doesn't move this turn, so body segments: old head (7,8) becomes new segment 2, so body = [(8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4)] plus new segment at old head? Wait, careful:  \n\nCurrent: head (7,8), body segments: (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4)  \nAfter UP to (7,9) and eat apple:  \nNew head: (7,9)  \nNew body: old head (7,8) becomes first body segment, then previous body segments shift:  \nBody = [(7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4)]  \nLength = 7.  \n\nFrom (7, 9) next turn, possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 8): my body (first segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 9): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 9): empty.  \n\nSo after eating apple, I\u2019d have only 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT). That\u2019s a bit risky but manageable if I plan ahead.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Alternative safe moves:**  \nDOWN to (7, 7): then from there, more mobility (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT likely safe except maybe RIGHT into (8,7) body? Let\u2019s check: from (7,7), RIGHT is (8,7) which is in my body after move? Wait, after moving to (7,7), my body is: [(7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4)]? No, if I move DOWN, no apple eaten, so tail moves:  \nCurrent: head (7,8), body: (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4)  \nMove DOWN to (7,7):  \nNew head: (7,7)  \nNew body: old head (7,8) becomes first segment, then (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), tail (8,4) is removed.  \nSo body = [(7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]  \nFrom (7,7), RIGHT is (8,7) which is in body \u2192 unsafe. So DOWN gives 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n\nLEFT to (6, 8):  \nNew head: (6,8)  \nBody: [(7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]  \nFrom (6,8), safe moves? Check:  \nUP (6,9) empty, DOWN (6,7) empty, LEFT (5,8) empty, RIGHT (7,8) body \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP gets apple now (score tiebreak advantage) but reduces next-turn options to 2.  \nLEFT or DOWN keep more options but delay apple.  \n\nGiven enemy is far and scores are tied at 5 apples each, getting to 6 first could be beneficial. Also, apple at (7,9) might be taken by enemy later if I don\u2019t grab it now \u2014 enemy is at (0,6), not close, but could move toward (1,9) apple first.  \n\nI think taking the apple now is worth the slight reduction in mobility next turn, since I can then plan a path out of (7,9) toward other apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (7,9), from (7,9) next turn I\u2019ll have only LEFT to (6,9) or RIGHT to (8,9). Choose based on which gives better access to remaining apples (likely RIGHT toward (9,5) and (9,3) apples, but need to check body positions then).  \n\n---\n\nUP",

Eliminate.  \n\n**UP to (1, 7)** \u2192 Check board: (1, 7) is empty in the board diagram ('.'), but my body is at (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8). (1, 7) is not in my body list. Enemy body? Snake #1's body: (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4). Not there. So (1, 7) is safe from static body collision.  \n\n**DOWN to (1, 5)** \u2192 Empty ('.'), safe from static collision.  \n\n**RIGHT to (2, 6)** \u2192 Empty ('.'), safe from static collision.  \n\nSo LEFT is out, UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe from static obstacles.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Consider enemy head movement and head-on collisions**  \n\nEnemy head at (7, 9) can move:  \n- UP \u2192 off board \u2192 enemy dies \u2192 good for me (but I can't rely on them choosing suicide).  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 8) is its own body \u2192 suicide for them if they choose.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 9) \u2192 safe for them, far from me.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 9) \u2192 safe for them.  \n\nNo possible enemy move this turn can reach (1, 7), (1, 5), or (2, 6) because they're too far (Manhattan distance > 1). So no head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate future safety / apple proximity**  \n\nApples:  \n- (1, 9): distance from (1, 6) = 3, from (1, 7) = 2, from (2, 6) = 4, from (1, 5) = 4.  \n- (1, 1): distance from (1, 6) = 5, from (1, 7) = 6, from (2, 6) = 5, from (1, 5) = 4.  \n- (9, 5), (9, 3), (8, 0) are far.  \n\nSo UP gets me closer to (1, 9).  \n\nCheck safe follow-up moves from each candidate:  \n\n**From (1, 7):**  \n- UP to (1, 8) \u2192 my body there \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN to (1, 6) \u2192 my body there \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT to (0, 7) \u2192 my body there \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT to (2, 7) \u2192 empty.  \n\nOnly RIGHT is safe next turn from (1, 7). That's risky (only 1 safe move next turn).  \n\n**From (1, 5):**  \n- UP to (1, 6) \u2192 my body there \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN to (1, 4) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT to (0, 5) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT to (2, 5) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo 3 safe moves next turn from (1, 5).  \n\n**From (2, 6):**  \n- UP to (2, 7) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN to (2, 5) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT to (1, 6) \u2192 my body there \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT to (3, 6) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo 3 safe moves next turn from (2, 6).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Choose**  \n\nUP leads to a dead end next turn (only 1 safe move), so it's dangerous.  \nDOWN and RIGHT both give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nApple (1, 1) is closer from (1, 5) than from (2, 6).  \nAlso, DOWN gets me away from my body cluster in top-left, opens more space.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 5), I can go DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT.

But it leaves me with only 2 safe moves next turn, stuck on the right edge.  \n\nDOWN (8, 4) avoids the edge, gives 3 safe moves next turn, and I can still target (9, 3) or (8, 0) later.  \n\nLEFT (7, 5) gives only 2 safe moves next turn and moves away from most apples.  \n\nGiven the game is long (turn 43/150) and apples lead matters, taking the apple now with RIGHT seems good if I can survive next turn. From (9, 5), I can go UP or DOWN next turn, both safe. That\u2019s enough to avoid immediate death.  \n\nAlso, enemy is far away, so no immediate head-on risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (9, 5), I\u2019ll be at length 8, head at (9, 5). Next turn, choose UP or DOWN depending on which is safer (likely UP to (9, 6) to move away from the right edge and toward center). Avoid moving back into my long body. Keep an eye on enemy possibly heading toward (1, 9) apple.  \n\nRIGHT",

So (9,4), (8,5), (9,6).  \nNone of my candidate moves (3,3), (2,2), (4,2) conflict with those enemy head positions.  \nAlso no immediate head-on possible because enemy is far away.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nNearest apple: (2, 2) is 1 step LEFT (Manhattan distance 1).  \n(3, 5) is 3 steps UP from my head (Manhattan distance 3).  \n(1, 9) far, (9, 3) far, (8, 0) far.  \n\nLEFT gets apple immediately, grows to length 8 next turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each move**  \n\n1. **LEFT to (2, 2)** \u2013 eat apple.  \nNext turn body: head (2, 2), then (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4) length 8.  \nFrom (2, 2):  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 1) \u2192 my body \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 my body \u2192 suicide.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 2) \u2192 my body \u2192 suicide.  \nSo only 1 safe move (UP) next turn \u2014 very dangerous, could trap me.  \n\n2. **UP to (3, 3)** \u2013 no apple.  \nBody next turn: head (3, 3), then (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4) length 8.  \nFrom (3, 3):  \n- UP \u2192 (3, 4) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 2) \u2192 my body \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n3. **RIGHT to (4, 2)** \u2013 no apple.  \nBody next turn: head (4, 2), then (3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4) length 8.  \nFrom (4, 2):  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 1) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 2) \u2192 my body \u2192 suicide.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 2) \u2192 empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term safety vs. apple gain**  \nLEFT gives apple but leaves only 1 safe move next turn \u2014 high risk of trapping myself.  \nUP moves toward (3, 5) apple with good options next turn.  \nRIGHT moves away from apples but keeps flexibility.  \n\nEnemy #1 is far top-right, not an immediate threat.  \nMy snake is longer than enemy? No, enemy length 8 (head + 7 body), my length 7. Enemy has 7 apples, I have 6.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nAvoid moves that reduce future options drastically unless necessary for survival or big gain.  \nEating apple at (2, 2) now would trap me badly \u2014 not worth it.  \nBetter to go UP toward (3, 5) while keeping flexibility.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter UP to (3, 3), next turn likely UP again toward (3, 5). Avoid getting pinned against my body. Monitor enemy movement.  \n\nUP",

Check each direction for immediate death:**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (3, 5):  \n  - On board: yes.  \n  - Not in my body? My body cells: (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2) \u2192 (3,5) not in list.  \n  - Not in enemy body? Snake #1 body: [(9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8)] \u2192 no.  \n  - Safe from head-on collision? Enemy head is (9,3), enemy moves simultaneously. Could enemy move to (3,5)? No, too far.  \n  - Apple at (3,5) \u2192 eating it means growth next turn.  \n  - Safe move.\n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 3):  \n  - On board: yes.  \n  - In my body? Yes, (3,3) is my neck \u2192 immediate death.  \n  - Eliminate.\n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 4):  \n  - On board: yes.  \n  - In my body? No.  \n  - In enemy body? No.  \n  - Apple? No.  \n  - Safe from head-on? Enemy head at (9,3) could move LEFT to (8,3) or other, not (2,4).  \n  - Safe move.\n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 4):  \n  - On board: yes.  \n  - In my body? No.  \n  - In enemy body? No.  \n  - Apple? No.  \n  - Safe from head-on? Enemy head at (9,3) cannot reach (4,4) in one move.  \n  - Safe move.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**2. Which moves keep future options open?**\n\n- **UP** to (3,5):  \n  - Eats apple \u2192 length increases by 1 next turn.  \n  - From (3,5), possible moves: UP to (3,6) [empty], LEFT to (2,5) [empty], RIGHT to (4,5) [empty], DOWN to (3,4) [empty now, but after growth, tail moves? Let\u2019s check].  \n    After eating apple, my body becomes: new head at (3,5), then old head (3,4) becomes second segment, then (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2) \u2192 tail at (1,2) will stay next turn (no growth yet, growth appears after move). Wait, correction: In Snake, if you eat an apple, you grow at the end *next* turn after moving? Actually typical Snake: you move head forward, if apple eaten, you don\u2019t delete the last segment this turn \u2192 length increases immediately by 1 cell at end of turn. But here: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point\" \u2014 means immediately after moving onto it, your body grows before next turn. So next turn, tail stays where it was, head moved, new segment added at head's previous position? No, growth adds segment at tail end? Actually typical Snake: head moves to new cell (apple), a new segment is added at the old tail position (so length increases by 1). But here they might mean: you grow by 1 segment \u2014 probably means you keep the tail where it was (so length+1). So from (3,5) next turn, possible moves: (3,6), (2,5), (4,5), (3,4) \u2014 but (3,4) will be occupied by my own body (old head). So DOWN from (3,5) next turn is into own body \u2192 not safe. So future moves from (3,5): UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options). That\u2019s okay.\n\n- **LEFT** to (2,4):  \n  - No apple.  \n  - From (2,4), possible moves: UP (2,5) [empty], DOWN (2,3) [empty], LEFT (1,4) [empty], RIGHT (3,4) [empty now, but next turn? Wait, my body will move: current neck (3,3) moves to (3,4)? Let\u2019s simulate: If I move LEFT to (2,4), head at (2,4), then body: old head (3,4) gone, neck (3,3) moves to old head (3,4), (3,2) moves to (3,3), etc., tail (1,2) moves to (1,3)? Actually tail movement: body segments shift: new head at (2,4), segment1 at old head (3,4), segment2 at old (3,3) \u2192 (3,4), segment3 at old (3,2) \u2192 (3,3), segment4 at old (3,1) \u2192 (3,2), segment5 at old (2,1) \u2192 (3,1), segment6 at old (1,1) \u2192 (2,1), tail old (1,2) disappears? Wait, length=7 currently (head + 6 body). After moving without apple, tail disappears from (1,2), new tail at (1,1)? Let\u2019s list:  \n    Current: head(3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2) tail.  \n    Move LEFT: new head (2,4).  \n    New body: old head (3,4) becomes new segment1, old (3,3) becomes segment2, old (3,2) becomes segment3, old (3,1) becomes segment4, old (2,1) becomes segment5, old (1,1) becomes segment6, old tail (1,2) is removed.  \n    So new body: [(2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1)].  \n    So from (2,4) next turn, possible moves:  \n      UP (2,5) empty,  \n      DOWN (2,3) empty,  \n      LEFT (1,4) empty,  \n      RIGHT (3,4) own body \u2192 not safe.  \n    So 3 options.\n\n- **RIGHT** to (4,4):  \n  - No apple.  \n  - From (4,4), body shifts similarly: new body: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1)], tail removed (1,2).  \n  - Possible next moves from (4,4): UP (4,5) empty, DOWN (4,3) empty, LEFT (3,4) own body (not safe), RIGHT (5,4) empty \u2192 3 options.\n\nSo all three safe moves give 3 options next turn.\n\n---\n\n**3. Apple proximity and enemy threat:**\n\nEnemy head at (9,3), body long, likely going for apples? Apples at (8,0), (1,9), (3,5), (2,2), (1,6).  \nClosest to enemy: (8,0) is 5 moves away Manhattan, (1,9) far.  \nMy closest apple: (3,5) one move UP, (2,2) two moves (DOWN+LEFT from head? Actually from (3,4): DOWN to (3,3) is death, so can\u2019t directly go to (2,2) now).  \n(1,6) is 5 moves away.\n\nIf I go UP, I get apple now, gain length, score 7 vs enemy 8. Also eating apple removes it from board, possibly denying enemy.  \nEnemy could try to intercept? No, too far.  \n\nBut possible head-on collision? Enemy head at (9,3) could move LEFT to (8,3), DOWN to (9,2), UP to (9,4), RIGHT to off-board death. So enemy\u2019s safe moves: LEFT, DOWN, UP. None reach (3,5). So safe.\n\n---\n\n**4. Which is safest long-term?**\n\nGoing UP eats apple, but after eating, my body occupies (3,4), so from (3,5) next turn DOWN is blocked. But I\u2019ll have UP/LEFT/RIGHT open. That\u2019s fine.  \nLEFT or RIGHT don\u2019t get apple, keep options similar but no growth.  \nGrowth is good for score but makes maneuvering harder later. But enemy is longer (8 apples \u2192 length 9 segments?), actually enemy length: head + 8 body segments? Wait apples collected 8 means length = 9? Actually starting length? Unknown. Anyway they\u2019re longer, so I need to catch up to win eventually.\n\nGiven I\u2019m behind 6 vs 8, I should take safe apples when possible.\n\n---\n\n**5. Trap risks:**\n\nFrom (3,5) after eating apple, board apples left: (8,0), (1,9), (2,2), (1,6). I could go to (2,2) via (2,5) \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 (2,2) maybe, but need to check future body block. Seems okay.  \nEnemy might go for (2,2) too? Possibly, but they\u2019re far.\n\n---\n\n**6. Decision:**\n\nUP gets apple safely, increases score, keeps 3 options next turn.  \nLEFT and RIGHT are safe but don\u2019t advance score.\n\nBest choice: **UP**.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (3,5), avoid DOWN into own body. Choose among UP/LEFT/RIGHT based on safety and proximity to apples (2,2) or (1,6). Watch enemy movement from (9,3)\u2014they might head toward (8,0) or (1,9). Keep path open to retreat if needed.\n\n---\n\nUP",

Need to check body blocks.  \nBut going LEFT now to (2,5) gets me closer to (2,2) than going UP to (3,6).  \nUP moves away from (2,2).  \nRIGHT moves away from (2,2).  \n\nEnemy head (8,3) closest apple is (7,1) distance 3, then (8,0) distance 3. Enemy likely heads down.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of head-on or trap**  \nEnemy is far; no immediate head-on risk.  \nMy current position (3,5) has open space above/left/right.  \nGoing LEFT to (2,5) keeps me nearer to apple (2,2) and also near (1,6) later.  \nGoing UP to (3,6) moves toward top but fewer apples there.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term strategy**  \nI\u2019m behind 7 vs 8 apples.

Closest apples to enemy: (8,0) distance 2, (7,1) distance 2.  \nEnemy will likely move DOWN/LEFT toward those apples, far from me.  \nNo immediate head-on risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nI have 7 apples, enemy has 8. Need to catch up.  \n(1,6) is reachable in 2 moves via UP\u2192LEFT or LEFT\u2192UP.  \nAlso, (2,2) is reachable later via DOWN moves from (2,5) but DOWN now reduces options.  \nGoing UP now keeps both (1,6) and (2,2) reachable: from (2,6), I can go LEFT to (1,6) for apple next turn, then later go DOWN toward (2,2).  \nGoing LEFT now to (1,5) also gets me to (1,6) next turn, but from (1,5) I\u2019m closer to left wall, slightly more constrained space.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP and LEFT both safe and equally close to apple (1,6).  \nUP gives slightly more central position after eating apple (from (1,6) after UP\u2192LEFT, my head will be at (1,6), then body extends toward (2,6) etc.).  \nLEFT now puts me at (1,5), then apple at (1,6) next move, but then my body will block leftward escape.  \n\nChecking board: after UP\u2192LEFT to eat apple at (1,6), my body will be [(1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)] length 9. Then from (1,6) after eating, possible moves: UP(1,7), DOWN(1,5) occupied by my new body segment? Wait \u2014 after eating apple, tail doesn\u2019t drop, so body grows by 1. Let\u2019s simulate:  \n\nTurn now: H(2,5), body[(3,5)...(1,1)] length 8.  \nMove UP to (2,6): new body [(2,6),(2,5),(3,5)...(2,1)] length 8 (tail (1,1) removed).  \nNext turn if LEFT to (1,6) apple there \u2192 eat apple \u2192 new body length 9: [(1,6),(2,6),(2,5),(3,5)...(2,1)] with extra segment at end (old tail not removed).  \nFrom (1,6) after eating: UP(1,7), DOWN(1,5) is now free? No, (1,5) is empty at that time? Let\u2019s check:  \nAt turn after eating apple, body: head (1,6), then (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1). So (1,5) is free. LEFT(0,6), RIGHT(2,6) occupied. So 3 options.  \n\nSimilar if I go LEFT now to (1,5), then UP to (1,6) apple: body after eating: [(1,6),(1,5),(2,5),(3,5)...(2,1)] length 9. From (1,6): UP(1,7), DOWN(1,5) occupied, LEFT(0,6), RIGHT(2,6) free.

Increases my length, which could help in trapping later.  \n3. No immediate danger on (1,6).  \n\nLEFT is safe and gets apple now. UP delays apple but keeps flexibility.  \nGiven the need to catch up in apples, taking (1,6) now is better.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (1,6) and eating apple, body length 9. From (1,6) next turn, check moves UP/DOWN/LEFT, avoid RIGHT into own body at (2,6). Possibly go UP to (1,7) to stay safe and move toward apple (1,9) later.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Wait, check:  \n(2,9) to (4,5): \u0394x=2, \u0394y=-4 \u2192 total 6.  \n(2,9) to (2,2): \u0394x=0, \u0394y=-7 \u2192 total 7.  \nSo (4,5) is closest at distance 6.\n\nDOWN to (2,8) gets closer to (4,5) (distance becomes 5).  \nRIGHT to (3,9) gets farther from (4,5) (distance becomes 7).\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future options after each safe move**  \n\n**DOWN to (2, 8):**  \nNo apple eaten, tail disappears (old tail (3,3) gone).  \nNew body: [(2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]  \nNext turn from (2,8): UP (2,9) occupied, DOWN (2,7) free, LEFT (1,8) occupied, RIGHT (3,8) free \u2192 only DOWN and RIGHT safe \u2192 2 options.\n\n**RIGHT to (3, 9):**  \nNo apple eaten, tail disappears.  \nNew body: [(3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (2,6), (2,5), (3,5), (3,4)]  \nNext turn from (3,9): UP off board, DOWN (3,8) free, LEFT (2,9) occupied, RIGHT (4,9) free \u2192 only DOWN and RIGHT safe \u2192 2 options.\n\nBoth give 2 safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy threat**  \nEnemy head at (6,4). Possible moves:  \nUP (6,5) free, DOWN (6,3) occupied by its body, LEFT (5,4) free, RIGHT (7,4) free.  \nEnemy could move toward apple (4,5) or (6,7). It\u2019s far from me right now (distance 4 in x, 5 in y \u2192 9 total), no immediate collision risk.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Pathing toward apples**  \nIf I go DOWN to (2,8), next turn I can go DOWN again to (2,7), then (2,6) is in my body so not safe, but I could go LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN from (2,7). That moves toward apple (2,2) or (4,5).  \nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), I\u2019m moving away from both closest apples.\n\nGiven scores tied at 9 apples each, getting to the next apple first matters.  \n(4,5) is closest to both snakes. Enemy is at (6,4), distance to (4,5) = 3.  \nI am at (2,9), distance to (4,5) = 6. If I go DOWN, distance becomes 5, still farther than enemy\u2019s 3. But maybe enemy won\u2019t go directly there \u2014 but they might.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Avoiding dead ends**  \nFrom (2,8), I can go DOWN to (2,7), then maybe RIGHT to (3,7) etc.  \nFrom (3,9), I can go DOWN to (3,8), then DOWN again to (3,7), etc. Both keep options open.\n\nBut DOWN seems better because:  \n1. Gets me closer to apples (4,5) and (2,2).  \n2. Avoids top row where I have fewer vertical moves (since UP is off board).  \n3. Enemy is far enough not to be an immediate threat.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2,8), choose DOWN or RIGHT depending on safety. Try to head toward (2,2) or (4,5), but watch enemy movement toward (4,5). If enemy is going for (4,5), maybe I should target (2,2) instead to avoid head-on collision risk.\n\nDOWN",

None overlap with (3, 9), (3, 7), or (4, 8). No collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nClosest apples: (4, 5) and (6, 7) both distance 4. (6, 7) is likely taken by enemy this turn (adjacent). (4, 5) is contested (enemy distance 3, ours 4).  \n- DOWN to (3, 7): distances to (4, 5)=3, (2, 2)=6, (1, 1)=8 \u2013 improves on all except (6, 7).  \n- RIGHT to (4, 8): distances to (4, 5)=3, (2, 2)=8 \u2013 improves on (4, 5) but worsens on (2, 2).  \n- UP to (3, 9): worsens all distances.  \nDOWN is best for reaching (2, 2) and maintains proximity to (4, 5).\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility**  \nAfter DOWN to (3, 7): new body = [(3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6), (2, 5)]. From (3, 7), safe moves: DOWN (3, 6), LEFT (2, 7), RIGHT (4, 7). However, LEFT leads to a dead end next turn (from (2, 7) all moves blocked), so we must avoid LEFT next turn. Still, two good options remain.  \nRIGHT to (4, 8) also gives three safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT), but UP leads toward top edge with fewer options.  \nDOWN keeps us centrally located and offers flexibility.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy anticipation**  \nEnemy likely moves UP to eat (6, 7), reaching 10 apples. We need to secure an apple soon. (4, 5) is risky due to enemy proximity; (2, 2) is safer. DOWN moves us toward (2, 2) while keeping (4, 5) reachable via future RIGHT+DOWN moves.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN minimizes distances to multiple apples, maintains good future options (if we avoid LEFT next turn), and positions us to contest (2, 2) or (4, 5) based on enemy movement.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 7), prefer DOWN or RIGHT to avoid the trap of going LEFT. Monitor enemy\u2019s new head position and apple consumption. If enemy ate (6, 7), consider targeting (2, 2) via (3, 6) \u2192 (3, 5) \u2192 (2, 5) or similar, or circle toward (4, 5) if enemy is not heading there. Keep space open and avoid boxing in.\n\nDOWN",

Wait, after moving DOWN to (3,6), my body becomes: head (3,6), then old head (3,7) becomes segment 2, then (3,8), etc. So (3,7) will be occupied by my body next turn \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN to (3,5): free currently.  \n- LEFT to (2,6): occupied by my body (2,6) is in my current body list \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT to (4,6): free.  \nSo from (3,6), only DOWN and RIGHT would be safe next turn. That\u2019s 2 options.  \n\nFrom (2,7):  \n- UP to (2,8): occupied by my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN to (2,6): occupied by my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT to (1,7): occupied by my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT to (3,7): occupied by my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nAll moves blocked \u2192 dead end next turn! So LEFT is very dangerous.  \n\nFrom (4,7):  \n- UP to (4,8): free.  \n- DOWN to (4,6): free.  \n- LEFT to (3,7): occupied by my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT to (5,7): free.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Good.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy apple threat**  \nEnemy at (6,7) is 2 away from apple (4,5) (LEFT twice). I\u2019m also 2 away from (4,5) via RIGHT+DOWN. Enemy might go LEFT to (5,7) then (4,7) or (5,6) etc. If I go RIGHT to (4,7), I\u2019m closer to (4,5) but also possibly moving toward enemy path. But we move simultaneously, so if enemy goes LEFT to (5,7), I go RIGHT to (4,7), we are adjacent but not colliding. Next turn from (4,7) I can go DOWN to (4,6) then (4,5), enemy from (5,7) could go DOWN to (5,6) then (4,6) \u2014 possible collision risk next turn. But I can adapt then.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (3,6), I\u2019m farther from (4,5) but maybe safer. But LEFT to (2,7) is suicide next turn, so eliminate LEFT.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term positioning**  \nWe have 9 apples, enemy has 10. Need to catch up. Apple (4,5) is contested but reachable. Apple (2,2) is near my tail area but might be safer. My tail ends at (2,5). If I go DOWN to (3,6), then next turn DOWN to (3,5), I\u2019m near (2,2) path. But (2,2) is also close to my body segments.  \n\nActually, looking at board:  \nMy tail: (2,5) is near apple (4,5)? No, (4,5) is east of that.  \nEnemy\u2019s long body along x=6 might block it from (4,5) quickly.  \n\nGiven future mobility, RIGHT (4,7) gives most options next turn and best progress toward (4,5).  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Final choice**  \nEliminate LEFT (dead end next turn).  \nBetween DOWN and RIGHT:  \n- DOWN (3,6) \u2192 only 2 safe moves next turn.  \n- RIGHT (4,7) \u2192 3 safe moves next turn, closer to apple (4,5).  \n\nI choose RIGHT.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4,7), assess enemy\u2019s new head position. Likely enemy will move toward (4,5) via (5,7) or (6,6)? Wait enemy at (6,7) could go LEFT to (5,7). If enemy is at (5,7) next to me at (4,7), avoid moving into its possible path. Instead maybe go DOWN to (4,6) or UP to (4,8) to avoid collision risk. Target apple (4,5) if safe, else aim for (2,2) via moving left after going down. Keep options open.  \n\nRIGHT",

If enemy goes DOWN, they\u2019ll be at (4, 6) next turn, then can eat (4, 5) on turn after.  \nIf I go LEFT to (5, 8), I can go DOWN to (5, 7) next turn, then LEFT to (4, 7) or DOWN to (5, 6) to approach apple from north/west. That\u2019s 3 steps to apple (5,8 \u2192 5,7 \u2192 4,7 \u2192 4,6 \u2192 4,5) unless I cut diagonally? Actually Manhattan: (5,8) to (4,5) is 1+3=4 moves. Enemy from (4,7) to (4,5) is 2 moves. So enemy will likely get (4,5) before me unless they don\u2019t go for it.  \n\nBut I have apple lead (10 vs 9). Maybe let enemy take (4,5) and target (2,2) or (4,1) instead to avoid risky adjacency.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nGoing UP to (6,9) leaves only 2 safe moves next turn \u2014 too restrictive.  \nGoing RIGHT to (7,8) moves away from most apples.  \nGoing LEFT to (5,8) keeps options open and is closer to multiple apples. Even if enemy takes (4,5), I can aim for (2,2) or (4,1) safely.  \n\nBetter to avoid top row trap. Choose LEFT.  \n\nLEFT",

Enemy could move LEFT to (5,8) then next turn? Not same cell this turn. So no head-on collision risk this turn for any of my moves.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (8,0), (2,2), (1,1), (4,5), (4,1).  \nFrom my head (4,7):  \n- (4,5) is 2 steps away (DOWN twice).  \n- (2,2) is Manhattan distance 7.  \n- (1,1) is 9.  \n- (4,1) is 6.  \n- (8,0) is 11.  \n\nFrom my candidate moves:  \n- **UP (4,8)**: dist to (4,5) = 3.  \n- **DOWN (4,6)**: dist to (4,5) = 1 (very close).  \n- **RIGHT (5,7)**: dist to (4,5) = 3.  \n\n**DOWN** puts me closest to apple (4,5).  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each move**  \nCheck next turn safe moves from each candidate:  \n\nFrom **(4,8)**:  \n- UP to (4,9): free.  \n- DOWN to (4,7): will be occupied by my body (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT to (3,8): occupied by my body (segment 3 currently at (3,8)) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT to (5,8): free (but enemy could move there this turn? That\u2019s fine).  \nSo from (4,8), only UP and RIGHT safe next turn \u2192 2 options.  \n\nFrom **(4,6)**:  \n- UP to (4,7): occupied by my old head \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN to (4,5): free (apple!).  \n- LEFT to (3,6): occupied by my body (segment 10 currently at (2,6)? Wait, (3,6) is free now? Check board: (3,6) is empty in board state. Actually my body: (2,6) is mine but (3,6) is free. Yes, (3,6) is free.  \n- RIGHT to (5,6): free.  \nSo from (4,6), DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT safe \u2192 3 options.  \n\nFrom **(5,7)**:  \n- UP to (5,8): free.  \n- DOWN to (5,6): free.  \n- LEFT to (4,7): occupied by my old head \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT to (6,7): occupied by enemy body (segment 2) \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo from (5,7), only UP and DOWN safe \u2192 2 options.  \n\nThus **DOWN** gives the most future safe moves (3), and also gets me closest to apple (4,5).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy path to apple (4,5)**  \nEnemy at (6,8): dist to (4,5) = 5 (LEFT 2, DOWN 3).  \nI could be at (4,6) next turn, apple at (4,5). Enemy could move LEFT to (5,8) then (5,7) etc., but still 3 steps away from apple next turn. I\u2019d be 1 step away and can grab it next turn if safe.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoiding dead ends**  \nMy body is mainly on left side, enemy body along x=6. Going DOWN to (4,6) seems safe and opens options.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nWe have 9 apples vs enemy 10. Need to catch up. Apple (4,5) is prime target. If I go DOWN now, next turn I can grab it unless enemy head gets close. Enemy at (6,8) can\u2019t reach (4,5) in 1 move, so I can likely get it next turn if I go DOWN now.  \n\n**Final choice:**  \nEliminate LEFT (unsafe).  \nBetween UP, DOWN, RIGHT:  \n- UP: fewer future moves, farther from nearest apple.  \n- RIGHT: fewer future moves, farther from apple.  \n- DOWN: most future moves, closest to apple (4,5).  \n\nI choose **DOWN**.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4,6), apple (4,5) is directly below. Check if enemy head is adjacent to (4,5) or (4,6) next turn; if safe, move DOWN to eat apple. If enemy head is at (5,5) or (4,5) predicted, maybe avoid collision by going LEFT/RIGHT instead. Prioritize survival over apple if risky.  \n\nDOWN",

Let\u2019s check: enemy body after eating: head (4,5), then (4,6), then (4,7), then (3,7), then (3,8)\u2026 yes (3,8) is enemy body in 2 segments behind head, so unsafe).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 8) \u2192 my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo only UP to (4, 9) safe next turn \u2192 also only 1 safe move.  \n\nHmm \u2014 both DOWN and LEFT lead to only 1 safe move next turn? Let\u2019s double-check DOWN case:  \n\nIf enemy eats apple at (4,5), enemy body next turn:  \nHead (4,5), then (4,6), then (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6) \u2014 length 11 (since they had 9 apples before, length 10, eating makes length 11).  \n\nSo from my (5,7) if I go DOWN now:  \nNext turn from (5,7):  \n- UP (5,8) my body.  \n- DOWN (5,6) empty.  \n- LEFT (4,7) enemy body (yes).  \n- RIGHT (6,7) my body.  \nSo indeed only DOWN safe.  \n\nLEFT case from (4,8) next turn:  \n- UP (4,9) empty.  \n- DOWN (4,7) enemy body.  \n- LEFT (3,8) enemy body (yes, 5th segment of enemy).  \n- RIGHT (5,8) my body.  \nSo only UP safe.  \n\nUP case from (5,9) next turn:  \n- UP off board.  \n- DOWN (5,8) my body.  \n- LEFT (4,9) empty.  \n- RIGHT (6,9) empty.  \nSo 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\nSo UP actually gives more options next turn despite being farther from apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term safety vs. apple chasing:**  \nI have apple lead (10 vs enemy 9 after they eat (4,5) \u2192 they\u2019ll have 10 too).  \nSo tie in apples after this turn.  \nSurvival is key. UP gives 2 safe moves next turn, DOWN/LEFT give 1 safe move \u2192 riskier.  \nBetter to stay alive and reposition later.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nGo UP now to (5,9) to keep options open, then next turn move LEFT or RIGHT away from top row, aiming for apples (2,2) or (4,1) later while avoiding enemy.  \n\nUP",

Enemy body? Board shows (5,7) empty now).  \n- LEFT to (4, 8): free.  \n- RIGHT to (6, 8): occupied by enemy body (segment 2 currently at (6,8)) \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo enemy could move DOWN to (5,7) or LEFT to (4,8) or UP to (5,9).  \n\nMy candidate safe moves:  \n- **DOWN (4,5)**: enemy cannot reach (4,5) in 1 move. Safe from head-on collision.  \n- **LEFT (3,6)**: enemy cannot reach (3,6) in 1 move. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT (5,6)**: enemy could move DOWN from (5,8) to (5,7), adjacent but not same cell. No head-on collision this turn.  \n\nSo all three moves avoid head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (8,0), (2,2), (1,1), (4,5), (4,1).  \nFrom my head (4,6):  \n- (4,5) is 1 step away DOWN.  \n- (4,1) is 5 steps.  \n- (2,2) is 6 steps.  \n- (1,1) is 8 steps.  \n- (8,0) is 10 steps.  \n\nDOWN directly gets apple (4,5).  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each move**  \n\nFrom **(4,5)** after eating apple (grow by 1, so tail stays):  \nBody will be: head new at (4,5), then old head (4,6), then (4,7), etc. Tail still at (1,6).  \nCheck safe moves from (4,5) next turn:  \n- UP to (4,6): occupied by my body (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN to (4,4): free.  \n- LEFT to (3,5): free.  \n- RIGHT to (5,5): free.  \nSo 3 safe moves from there after eating apple.  \n\nFrom **(3,6)** without apple:  \n- UP to (3,7): occupied by my body (segment 3 currently at (3,7)) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN to (3,5): free.  \n- LEFT to (2,6): free (board shows (2,6) empty? Wait, my body: (2,6) is free now because tail is at (1,6)? Actually my body list: (1,6) is last segment, (2,6) is not in my body, so yes free).  \n- RIGHT to (4,6): occupied by my old head \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo from (3,6): DOWN and LEFT safe \u2192 2 options.  \n\nFrom **(5,6)** without apple:  \n- UP to (5,7): free.  \n- DOWN to (5,5): free.  \n- LEFT to (4,6): occupied by my old head \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT to (6,6): occupied by enemy body (segment 3 currently at (6,6)) \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo from (5,6): UP and DOWN safe \u2192 2 options.  \n\nThus **DOWN** gives more future safe moves (3) and gets an apple.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy path to apple (4,5)**  \nEnemy at (5,8): distance to (4,5) = 4 steps.  \nIf I move DOWN to (4,5) this turn, I eat it immediately, enemy can\u2019t interfere.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk of moving onto apple**  \nNo risk of collision with enemy head this turn at (4,5).  \nEating apple grows me, but that doesn\u2019t trap me next turn because from (4,5) I have 3 exits.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI have 9 apples, enemy has 10. Getting apple (4,5) ties score at 10\u201310.  \nAfter eating, plan next turn: from (4,5), consider moving towards (4,1) or (2,2) while avoiding enemy. Enemy body along x=6 blocks east, but my body on left may limit west movement soon. Need to loop around possibly downward then right later.  \n\n**Final choice:**  \nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \nDOWN gets apple, ties score, gives best future mobility.  \nLEFT/RIGHT don\u2019t get apple and give fewer future options.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4,5) after eating apple, check safe moves (likely DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Avoid moving back into own body at (4,6). Possibly go DOWN to (4,4) to open space, then left toward (2,2) apple. Monitor enemy head at (5,8) or wherever it moves.  \n\nDOWN",

Let\u2019s check:  \n  (4, 3) is not occupied by my body (my body coordinates: (4,5) through (1,7) \u2014 no (4,3) there).  \n  Not occupied by enemy body (enemy body: (5,9) through (6,1) \u2014 no (4,3) there).  \n  Enemy head at (4,9) cannot reach (4,3) in one move.  \n  So (4,3) is safe.  \n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (3, 4) \u2192 not in my body, not in enemy body, not enemy head\u2019s possible moves (enemy from (4,9) can move to (3,9), (5,9), (4,8), (4,10) invalid). So safe.  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (5, 4) \u2192 not in my body, not in enemy body. Enemy head from (4,9) cannot reach (5,4) in one move. So safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. UP is unsafe.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 2 \u2013 Evaluate safe moves for next-turn risks and apple proximity:\n\n**DOWN (4,3)** \u2013 lands on apple, so I grow by 1, new head at (4,3), tail stays (1,7) because eating apple means I don\u2019t move tail this turn.  \nRisks: enemy head (4,9) \u2192 possible moves: (3,9), (5,9), (4,8) \u2013 none threaten (4,3) next turn. But after I eat apple, my body will be longer and maybe block some future moves.  \nNext turn from (4,3): possible moves UP (back to 4,4) which is now empty because body moved? Wait, after eating apple, body segments shift: new body = [(4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8)] (11 long).

Body shifts forward: new head (3,4), tail (1,7) disappears, so body = [(3,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8)] (length 11 still).  \nFrom (3,4) next turn:  \nUP (3,5) \u2013 free now.  \nDOWN (3,3) \u2013 free now.  \nLEFT (2,4) \u2013 free now.  \nRIGHT (4,4) \u2013 my own body (neck) \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn from (3,4) too.  \n\n---\n\n**RIGHT (5,4)** \u2013 no apple. Body shifts: new head (5,4), tail gone: body = [(5,4), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8)].  \nFrom (5,4) next turn:  \nUP (5,5) \u2013 free.  \nDOWN (5,3) \u2013 free.  \nLEFT (4,4) \u2013 my neck \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (6,4) \u2013 enemy body (6,4) is part of enemy snake\u2019s body (enemy body: (6,8)...(6,1) includes (6,4)) \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo only 2 safe moves next turn from (5,4).  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Compare:\n\nDOWN: gets apple, 3 safe moves next turn, moves toward bottom-left apples cluster (1,1), (2,2) after.  \nLEFT: no apple, 3 safe moves next turn.  \nRIGHT: no apple, only 2 safe moves next turn (worse).  \n\nSo DOWN is best \u2013 immediate apple gain, tiebreak in apples vs enemy (both at 10 now), and good future mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nWe\u2019re at 11 length after eating apple at (4,3). From (4,3), consider moving toward (2,2) or (1,1) apples via LEFT/DOWN next, but avoid boxing self in. Enemy snake is on right side far away, so focus on clearing apples on left side while keeping escape routes.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

That\u2019s a trap.  \n\n**LEFT to (3,9):**  \nNew body: head (3,9), then (4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) length 12.  \nFrom (3,9) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,8) \u2192 enemy body next turn (as above) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,9) \u2192 enemy body next turn? Enemy current body includes (2,9) as segment 7, so after enemy moves and grows, (2,9) remains enemy body segment 8 \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,9) \u2192 my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo from (3,9) next turn, all moves unsafe too.  \n\nThis suggests both DOWN and LEFT lead to certain death next turn if enemy goes DOWN to (4,3). But enemy might not go DOWN \u2014 they have LEFT and RIGHT options too. If enemy goes LEFT to (3,4) or RIGHT to (5,4), then my safe options open up.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Minimax risk**  \nIf enemy goes DOWN (eats apple, grows), I die next turn from either DOWN or LEFT now.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT or RIGHT, I survive next turn from one of my moves now.  \n\nWhich of DOWN or LEFT now gives more chance to survive if enemy doesn\u2019t go DOWN?  \n\nCheck if enemy might avoid DOWN:  \n- DOWN gets apple (4,3), increases score to 11, longer body. Likely choice for them.  \nBut maybe they see risk? Unclear.  \n\nGiven that, maybe I should go LEFT to (3,9) because if enemy goes LEFT to (3,4), then (3,8) might be free next turn? Wait, if enemy goes LEFT to (3,4), they don\u2019t eat apple, so tail moves: their tail (1,7) leaves, so (3,8) might become free? Their body after moving LEFT: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8) length 11. So (3,8) still occupied. So still unsafe for me.  \n\nActually both DOWN and LEFT now seem to put me adjacent to enemy body next turn no matter what enemy does, except if enemy goes RIGHT to (5,4), then from my (4,8) maybe DOWN to (4,7) is free? If enemy goes RIGHT to (5,4), their body: head (5,4), then (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8) length 11. So (4,7) still enemy body segment 5. So still unsafe.  \n\nThis is bad \u2014 I\u2019m near top, enemy below, my body blocks right, enemy body blocks left/down.  \n\nMaybe I should go LEFT to (3,9) and hope enemy goes RIGHT, then next turn my only safe move might be UP? No, UP off board. So still dead.  \n\nWait \u2014 I must have miscalculated: from (3,9) next turn, if enemy goes RIGHT to (5,4), then (3,8) is enemy body segment 7, (2,9) enemy body segment 9, (4,9) my body. So all adjacent cells occupied or off-board. So indeed no escape next turn.  \n\nSo both DOWN and LEFT lead to death next turn if enemy moves optimally? That suggests I missed a safe move earlier \u2014 but RIGHT was unsafe (my body), UP unsafe. So maybe I\u2019m trapped now.  \n\nBut maybe enemy doesn\u2019t move optimally \u2014 but I must assume they might take apple.  \n\nGiven that, maybe I choose DOWN to (4,8) to be closer to possible future escape if enemy doesn\u2019t go DOWN, but seems unlikely.  \n\nActually, let\u2019s check if from (4,8) next turn, if enemy goes RIGHT to (5,4), is (4,7) free? No, (4,7) is enemy body segment 5. So no.  \n\nSo I\u2019m dead next turn unless enemy suicides.  \n\nGiven that, I\u2019ll pick LEFT to (3,9) to possibly delay? But both equal.  \n\nI\u2019ll go LEFT to keep away from enemy\u2019s immediate area.  \n\nLEFT",

Board shows at row 8 col 3: \u2018T\u2019 (enemy body). Yes, enemy body at (3,8) currently \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,9) \u2192 board shows \u2018T\u2019 (enemy body) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,9) \u2192 my body segment 2 \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nAll four moves appear immediately deadly. But wait \u2014 the board state given is *before* this turn\u2019s movement, and snakes move simultaneously. So (3,8) and (2,9) are currently occupied by enemy body, but enemy will move this turn, potentially vacating those cells.  \n\nRules: We die if we move into a cell that *will be occupied* by any snake\u2019s body after movement resolves. That means:  \n- If enemy moves away from (3,8) this turn, and no other snake moves into it, then (3,8) could be free for me.  \n- But we must check: enemy\u2019s possible moves from (4,3) and whether their tail moves (if they don\u2019t eat apple).  \n\n**Enemy possible moves from (4,3):**  \nEnemy body: [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (1,7)] length 12.  \nFrom (4,3):  \n- UP \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 own body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,3) \u2192 empty.  \n\nEnemy safe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (4,2): their new head (4,2), body: head + (4,3), (4,4), \u2026, tail (1,8)? Wait, they have 11 apples \u2192 length 12. If they don\u2019t eat apple this turn, tail (1,7) disappears, so (3,8) and (2,9) remain in their body? Let\u2019s trace: current enemy body list above. After moving DOWN to (4,2) without eating apple:  \nNew body: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8) \u2014 tail (1,7) gone. So (3,8) and (2,9) still in their body.  \n\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (3,3): new body: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), \u2026, (3,8), (2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8), tail (1,7) gone. So (3,8) and (2,9) still occupied.  \n\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (5,3): new body: (5,3), (4,3), (4,4), \u2026, (3,8), (2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (1,8), tail (1,7) gone. So (3,8) and (2,9) still occupied.  \n\nThus no matter where enemy moves, (3,8) and (2,9) remain occupied by enemy body this turn after movement (since they are far from the tail which moves only if they eat apple \u2014 but they won\u2019t eat apple this turn unless they move onto (4,1) or (3,0) or (2,2) etc., none of which are in their immediate move options).  \n\nTherefore:  \n- DOWN to (3,8) \u2192 will be enemy body after movement \u2192 deadly.  \n- LEFT to (2,9) \u2192 will be enemy body after movement \u2192 deadly.  \n- RIGHT to (4,9) \u2192 my body (since my body doesn\u2019t move away from (4,9) unless I move there, but I\u2019m at (3,9) moving, so (4,9) is my 2nd segment after I move) \u2192 deadly.  \n- UP to (3,10) \u2192 off board \u2192 deadly.  \n\nSo I have no safe moves? That means I\u2019m trapped and will die this turn no matter what.  \n\nBut wait \u2014 could enemy eat an apple this turn?  \nApples at: (8,0), (2,2), (1,1), (4,1), (3,0).  \nEnemy at (4,3):  \n- DOWN to (4,2) \u2192 no apple.  \n- LEFT to (3,3) \u2192 no apple.  \n- RIGHT to (5,3) \u2192 no apple.  \n\nSo enemy cannot eat apple this turn. So tail (1,7) will disappear, but (3,8) and (2,9) remain in their body.  \n\nThus indeed all four moves from (3,9) are fatal.  \n\nBut maybe I missed: if enemy moves RIGHT to (5,3), their body list shifts, but (3,8) and (2,9) are still in it (positions 8 and 9 in the list). Yes.  \n\nSo I am dead this turn no matter what.  \n\nGiven that, I must pick a move anyway. The least risky? Possibly DOWN into enemy body \u2014 but same result.  \n\nI\u2019ll pick DOWN to end closer to center.  \n\n**Plan for next turn (if somehow alive):**  \nActually impossible.  \n\nDOWN",

That means enemy snake will die this turn if it moves into any of those. But since snakes move simultaneously, I must still consider head-on collisions if I move into a cell enemy could move into \u2014 but enemy has no safe moves, so it will die regardless.  \n\nBut careful: enemy could still choose a direction that kills it, but if it chooses RIGHT into (4,9) (its own body), it dies; if it chooses DOWN into (3,8) (my body), it dies; etc. So enemy will die this turn no matter what. That means if I survive this turn, I win immediately (all opponents dead).  \n\nSo my priority: survive this turn.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Check head-on collisions:\n\nEnemy head (3,9) possible moves (even if fatal):  \n- UP (3,10) off board  \n- DOWN (3,8) my body  \n- LEFT (2,9) my body  \n- RIGHT (4,9) enemy body  \n\nNone of my safe moves (DOWN to (4,2), LEFT to (3,3), RIGHT to (5,3)) are in {(3,10), (3,8), (2,9), (4,9)}. So no head-on collision possible.  \n\nTherefore all three moves are safe from immediate death and from head-on collision.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Choose among safe moves:\n\nSince enemy will die, I just need to avoid killing myself.  \n\n- **DOWN** (4,2): moves toward apple cluster (2,2), (1,1), (3,0).  \n- **LEFT** (3,3): moves toward (2,2), (1,1).  \n- **RIGHT** (5,3): moves away from most apples, toward right side where no apples remain except (8,0) far away.  \n\nDOWN and LEFT both good. RIGHT less efficient for future apple gathering.  \n\nLet\u2019s check next turn mobility from each:  \n\nFrom (4,2):  \nUP (4,3) \u2013 my old head position now empty? Actually after I move to (4,2), my body shifts: head (4,2), neck (4,3), tail (1,7) gone. So (4,3) will be my neck \u2192 unsafe next turn.  \nDOWN (4,1) \u2013 has apple \u2192 good.  \nLEFT (3,2) \u2013 free.  \nRIGHT (5,2) \u2013 free.  \nSo from (4,2), next turn safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 moves).  \n\nFrom (3,3):  \nUP (3,4) \u2013 free.  \nDOWN (3,2) \u2013 free.  \nLEFT (2,3) \u2013 free.  \nRIGHT (4,3) \u2013 my neck \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo from (3,3), next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 moves).  \n\nBoth have 3 safe moves next turn. DOWN gets me closer to (4,1) apple next turn.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note:\n\nEnemy dies this turn, so game may end immediately after this turn if I survive. If not (maybe rules require turn to complete), I\u2019ll be alone on board with apples at (8,0), (2,2), (1,1), (4,1), (3,0). Plan: from (4,2) go DOWN to (4,1) for apple, then toward (2,2) and (1,1), avoiding boxing myself. Keep distance from own body.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nDOWN",
