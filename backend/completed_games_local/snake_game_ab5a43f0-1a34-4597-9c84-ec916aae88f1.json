Safe.\n\n**Strategy:**\nSince my body is currently empty, I have no constraints on movement except for the board boundaries and the enemy snake.\nMy current target should be the apple at (3, 2) or (2, 2) in the bottom-left quadrant. The apple at (1, 5) is also a strong candidate as it aligns with my current Y-coordinate.\n\n*   **Going for (1, 5):** Requires moving Left 7 times.

I am at (8, 5).\nIf I move Left towards (1, 5), I am moving into open space.\nThe only danger is Snake #1 moving down aggressively to cut me off, but since I am closer to (1, 5) than he is, I should secure the path.\n\nMoving Left puts me on the path to the apple at (1, 5).\n\nLet's check safety again for LEFT -> (7, 5).\n(7, 5) is empty.\nI am not moving into my own body (I have none).\nEnemy snake is at (1, 9), which is far away.\nTherefore, LEFT is a safe and productive move.\n\nLong-term plan: Move Left towards (1, 5) to collect the first apple.

I am currently on an apple (at (7,5) based on the text description, though the visual board shows an 'A' at (1,5) and an 'A' at (8,5) relative to my head at (7,5). Wait, looking closely at the board map:\n    Row 5 shows `. A . . . . . 0 . .`\n    My head is at (7,5).\n    The cell (8,5) has an 'A' (Apple) according to the board.\n    So I am at (7,5), and (8,5) is an Apple. The apple list includes (1,5) and others, but the board visualization seems to show an apple at (8,5) which is not in the provided list. However, the text says \"Apples at: ... (1,5) ...\". The board map has 'A' at (1,5) (Row 5, col 1) and 'A' at (8,5) (Row 5, col 8). I should trust the board map visual over the text list if they conflict, or perhaps the text list is just a subset of what is actually there. The board map is the immediate ground truth.\n    *Correction:* The board map shows:\n    Row 5: `. A . . . . . 0 . .`\n    This corresponds to Y=5. X=1 is 'A'. X=7 is '0' (Me). X=8 is empty? No, wait.\n    Let's look at the columns:\n    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    Row 9: `. . . . . . . . . A`\n    Row 8: `A 1 . . . . . . . .`\n    Row 5: `. A . . . . . 0 . .` -> At Y=5, X=1 is A. At Y=5, X=7 is 0.\n    There is an apple at (1,5) (mentioned in text and map).\n    There is an apple at (8,5) (Map shows it, but text didn't list it? Or I am miscounting).\n    Actually, looking at the map again: `Row 5: . A . . . . . 0 . .`\n    If (0,0) is bottom left, then X goes 0 to 9. Y goes 0 to 9.\n    Row 5 (Y=5) has 'A' at the second position (X=1). It has '0' at the 8th position (X=7).\n    Wait, if '0' is at (7,5), and the row is `. A . . . . . 0 . .`:\n    Index 0: .\n    Index 1: A\n    ...\n    Index 7: 0\n    So (7,5) is correct.\n    Is there an apple at (8,5)? The row shows `.` at Index 8. So (8,5) is empty.\n    Okay, the map matches the text list mostly. The text list is the definitive list of apples. The map is a visual aid.\n    \n    *Current State:*\n    Head: (7,5).\n    Apples: (1,5), (3,2), (9,9), (2,2), (0,8).\n    Enemy #1: Head (1,8).\n    \n    **Safety Check (Immediate Threats):**\n    *   **UP:** (7,6). Empty. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN:** (7,4). Empty. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT:** (6,5). Empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT:** (8,5). Empty. Safe.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI am at (7,5). The closest apple is at (1,5) (Manhattan distance 6).\nAnother close apple is at (3,2) (Distance 5 + 3 = 8).\nAnother is at (2,2) (Distance 5 + 3 = 8).\nThe apple at (0,8) is distance 7 + 3 = 10.\nThe apple at (9,9) is distance 2 + 4 = 6.\n\nDistance to (1,5): |7-1| + |5-5| = 6.\nDistance to (9,9): |7-9| + |5-9| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n\nBoth are equally distant.\n(1,5) is West.\n(9,9) is East.\nEnemy #1 is at (1,8). He is near (1,5).\nIf I go for (1,5), I might have to fight Snake #1.\nIf I go for (9,9), I am moving away from Snake #1.\nHowever, (1,5) is on the same Y-line, so it's a straight shot.\nSnake #1 is at (1,8). Distance to (1,5) is 3.\nSnake #1 is closer to (1,5) than I am.\nTherefore, (1,5) is contested.\nI should avoid fighting over apples if possible.\nThe apple at (9,9) is un-contested.\nMoving RIGHT puts me closer to (9,9) and also keeps my path open.\nMoving LEFT puts me closer to the contested apple at (1,5).\nGiven that Snake #1 is closer to (1,5), I should prioritize the safer apple (9,9) or the other one at (3,2).\nWait, let's re-evaluate distance to (3,2).\n|7-3| + |5-2| = 4 + 3 = 7. (Wait, |7-3| is 4? No, 7-3=4. Yes).\nSo (1,5) is 6. (9,9) is 6. (3,2) is 7.\n(2,2) is 8.\n(0,8) is 10.\n\nSince (1,5) is contested by snake #1 (who is 3 units away), and (9,9) is 6 units away for me (and likely further for him), (9,9) seems safer.\nHowever, moving RIGHT to (8,5) gets me 1 step closer to (9,9).\nMoving LEFT to (6,5) gets me 1 step closer to (1,5).\nIf I go LEFT, I engage the enemy. If I go RIGHT, I play safe.\nThe prompt says \"prefer moves that keep future options open\".\nIf I go LEFT, I might get blocked. If I go RIGHT, I have the whole right side of the board open.\nAlso, there is an apple at (9,9).\nI will choose RIGHT.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

This matches the map.\n\n**Immediate Threats & Safety Check:**\n*   **UP (8, 6):** Row 6 at X=8 is `.` (Row 6: `6 . . . . . . . . . .`). Safe.\n*   **DOWN (8, 4):** Row 4 at X=8 is `.` (Row 4: `4 . . . . . . . . . .`). Safe.\n*   **LEFT (7, 5):** Row 5 at X=7 is `.` (The string index for X=7 is '.'). Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (9, 5):** Row 5 at X=9 is `.`. Safe.\n*   All immediate moves are safe.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n*   **Distance to Apples:**\n    *   **(9, 9):** Manhattan distance |8-9| + |5-9| = 1 + 4 = 5.\n    *   **(1, 5):** Manhattan distance |8-1| + |5-5| = 7.\n    *   **(2, 2):** Manhattan distance |8-2| + |5-2| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n    *   **(3, 2):** Manhattan distance |8-3| + |5-2| = 5 + 3 = 8.\n    *   **(0, 8):** Manhattan distance |8-0| + |5-8| = 8 + 3 = 11.\n*   **Enemy Proximity:**\n    *   Snake #1 is at (1, 7).\n    *   Closest apple to Snake #1 is likely (1, 5) (Distance 2) or (2, 2) (Distance 6).\n    *   The apple at (9, 9) is significantly far away from Snake #1 (Distance |1-9| + |7-9| = 8+2=10).\n*   **Path Analysis:**\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** towards (9, 9) is the shortest path to the nearest apple. It keeps me in the top-right quadrant, away from the enemy.\n    *   Moving **LEFT** puts me on a collision course for the apple at (1, 5), which is very close to the enemy. Since the enemy is closer to (1, 5) than I am, fighting for it is risky.\n    *   Moving **UP** or **DOWN** maintains the current X-coordinate but moves me away from the (9, 9) apple (Y=9). While safe, it delays the path to the closest apple.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe apple at (9, 9) is the closest reachable target. The enemy is on the opposite side of the board (Left), so heading Right is safe from immediate interception. Moving RIGHT brings me closer to (9, 9) and keeps the path open.\n\nRIGHT",

LEFT would take me toward the apple at (0,8), but it's further away and there's no immediate benefit.\n\nMoving DOWN doesn't seem optimal as it moves me away from the nearest apple cluster.\n\n## Long-term Plan\n\nI should prioritize the apple cluster at (2,2) and (3,2) since they're closest.

Body is empty.\n    *   **Apple at (9, 9):** This is directly **UP** from my current position.\n\n2.  **Evaluate moves:**\n    *   **UP (to 9, 9):** This is the most logical move. It allows me to consume the apple at (9, 9).\n        *   *Post-move state:* I am at (9, 9). I have collected 1 apple.\n        *   *Next turn implications:* Because I ate an apple, I will grow. My tail will not move forward, creating a new body segment at (9, 8).\n        *   *Danger Check:* If I am at (9, 9) with a body segment at (9, 8), I cannot go UP (off board) or DOWN (into my own body) next turn. I will be effectively pinned against the wall. However, since I am in the corner, I can still move LEFT to (8, 9).\n        *   *Strategic Value:* Securing points is the primary objective. Being pinned in a corner is a risk, but the apple is worth 1 point. Given the distance of other apples, this is the best immediate score.\n    *   **LEFT (to 8, 8):** This keeps me alive but leaves the apple for the opponent (if they can reach it) or future uncertainty. It is safer regarding mobility but yields 0 points this turn.\n    *   **DOWN (to 9, 7):** Moves away from the apple. Unproductive.\n    *   **RIGHT (to 10, 8):** Off board. Deadly.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    The move **UP** is the only move that scores a point this turn. While it creates a \"trap\" scenario for the *following* turn (where I will be forced to turn LEFT), that is a manageable situation given the board is open to the left (row 9 shows `.` for x=8 and x=7).\n\nTherefore, the best move is UP.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat the apple at (9, 9) immediately. On the next turn, my growth will prevent me from moving DOWN. I will move LEFT to (8, 9) to escape the corner and search for the next apple.\n\nUP",

No. Wait, my body is only one segment long at (9,9). The previous position (9,9) becomes the tail, and (8,9) becomes the body. So moving DOWN is legal to (8,8).\n        \n        Let's check the provided board state again.\n        `9 . . . . . . . . 0 T`\n        This row shows: column 8 is '0', column 9 is 'T'.\n        So my Head is at (8,9). My Tail is at (9,9).\n        \n        **Move Options:**\n        *   **UP:** (8,10) -> Off board. **DEAD**.\n        *   **DOWN:** (8,8). Is (8,8) free? The board shows `.` at (8,8). Yes.\n        *   **LEFT:** (7,9). Is (7,9) free? The board shows `.` at (7,9). Yes.\n        *   **RIGHT:** (9,9). Is (9,9) free? The board shows `T` at (9,9). This is my tail. **DEAD**.\n        \n        So valid moves are DOWN and LEFT.\n        \n        **Comparison of DOWN vs LEFT:**\n        *   **DOWN (to 8,8):** Moves me directly into the center of the top row. Row 8 has an apple at (0,8). From (8,8), I can move LEFT to (7,8) towards (0,8), or DOWN to (8,7) towards (8,2) or (7,4).\n        *   **LEFT (to 7,9):** Moves me to the edge of the board. From (7,9), I can only go DOWN (to 7,8) or RIGHT (back to 8,9). This restricts my options slightly more than being at (8,8).\n        \n        **Strategy:**\n        The previous turn I moved LEFT to open up space. Now that I have space, I should descend to access the board.\n        The apples at (8,2) and (7,4) are close. Descending puts me on the path to them.\n        \n        Let's check for enemy collision. Enemy Head at (2,2).\n        Enemy moves: Possible moves are (3,2), (1,2), (2,3), (2,1).\n        (2,3) is body.\n        (2,1) is free.\n        (1,2) is free.\n        (3,2) is an apple.\n        \n        If I move DOWN to (8,8), no conflict with enemy.\n        If I move LEFT to (7,9), no conflict.\n        \n        I will move **DOWN** to (8,8). This is the center of the top row and provides access to both the left side (for apple at 0,8) and the center column (for apple at 4,7 and 8,2).\n        \n        **Long-term Plan:**\n        Move DOWN to (8,8). From there, assess the path to (8,2) or (0,8). Watch for snake #1 moving up.\n\nDOWN",

This is generally the most efficient move for diagonal targets.\n    *   **Controlling the Center:** Moving to (7, 6) also moves me slightly away from the right wall (x=9), keeping my options more open compared to staying at x=8.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nTarget apple at (7, 4). Move LEFT now to align X coordinate, then DOWN twice. From (7, 4), re-evaluate board state for next target (likely (8, 2) or (4, 7)).\n\nLEFT",

The apple at (7, 4) is right in front of me.\n    *   Moving **UP** is fatal.\n    *   Is there a risk to moving DOWN? The only potential risk is if the enemy snake grows and catches me later, or if I trap myself. However, the apple at (7, 4) is directly below me. Taking the guaranteed point and growing is the optimal play.\n\n7.  **Final Decision:**\n    *   Move DOWN to (7, 4) to eat the apple.\n    *   This creates a new body segment at (7, 5). My body will be [(7, 5), (7, 6), (8, 6)] (assuming the tail (8,6) doesn't move because I ate).\n    *   After eating, I will be at (7, 4) with an extra body segment, looking for the next target (likely (8, 2) or (4, 7)).\n\n    *   *Self-Correction/Double Check:*\n        *   Enemy at (7, 2). If enemy moves UP to (7, 3), we are still safe. If enemy moves RIGHT to (8, 2), we are safe.\n        *   My body at (7, 6) and (8, 6). I am moving to (7, 4).\n        *   This move is safe and scores a point.\n\n    *   *Long Term Plan:*\n        After eating (7, 4), my tail will likely be (8, 6). My body will be (7, 5), (7, 6). I will be at (7, 4). From there, I can chase (8, 2) or (4, 7). (4, 7) is further away. (8, 2) is close, but snake #1 is there. I need to be careful. I will re-evaluate after I eat.\n\n    *   *Wait, looking at the Board State again provided in prompt:*\n        Row 6: `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `T` `.` `.`\n        My current position is (7,5). My body is listed as [(7,6)].\n        If I move DOWN to (7,4), my new body is [(7,5), (7,6)]. The tail (8,6) from the visual is gone? No, the visual \"T\" at (7,6) might be a visual artifact or the prompt is slightly simplified.\n        Let's trust the explicit coordinates: Head (7,5), Body [(7,6)].\n        If I eat, I grow. My body becomes [(7,5), (7,6)]. Tail remains (7,6) for one turn (effectively).\n\n    *   *Risk Check:*\n        Snake #1 at (7,2) with body at (6,2)-(3,2).\n        If Snake #1 moves UP to (7,3), it doesn't hit me.\n        If Snake #1 moves UP to (7,4) *next* turn (after I move there), I will be there. But I move simultaneously.\n        If I move DOWN to (7,4), and Snake #1 moves UP to (7,3), we are distinct.\n        If I move DOWN to (7,4), and Snake #1 moves UP to (7,4), we die together. Is Snake #1 likely to move UP?\n        Snake #1 is at (7, 2). Apples are at (8, 2) (distance 1), (1, 2) (distance 6), (0, 8), (4, 7), (7, 4) (distance 2).\n        Snake #1 will almost certainly go for (8, 2) or maybe (7, 4).\n        If Snake #1 goes for (8, 2), it moves RIGHT to (8, 2). Safe for me.\n        If Snake #1 goes for (7, 4), it moves UP to (7, 3) this turn, then UP to (7, 4) next turn.\n        Since I am moving to (7, 4) *this* turn, and Snake #1 would need to move UP *this* turn to hit me (they can't reach (7, 4) from (7, 2) in one turn), I am safe from head-on collision this turn.\n        However, I must consider next turn. If I am at (7, 4) and Snake #1 is at (7, 3), I might be trapped if I don't eat and grow.\n        But I *am* eating. So I will grow. This improves my survival odds.\n\n    *   *Alternative:* If I don't take (7, 4), I might lose it to someone else or just waste time.\n    *   *Final check on safety of DOWN:*\n        (7, 4) is an empty square (Apple A).\n        It is not a snake body part.\n        It is not a wall.\n        It is not my own head backwards.\n        It is a valid move.\n\n    *   *Plan:*\n        Move DOWN to (7, 4) to eat the apple.\n        Next turn, look at (8, 2) or (4, 7).\n\nDecision: DOWN.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (7, 4) immediately. My body will be [(7, 5), (7, 6)]. From (7, 4), I will likely target the apple at (8, 2) next. I must watch Snake #1's movement towards (8, 2); if it moves there, I may need to switch to (4, 7). I have growth now, which is crucial.\n\nDOWN",

(2, 3) is near Snake #1's tail (Snake 1 body is at (3, 2)).\n        *   Moving LEFT clears my own body block at (7, 4) next turn, opening up the path UP.\n        *   Moving DOWN keeps my body directly below my head, blocking DOWN next turn but opening LEFT/RIGHT.\n\n    *   **Decision:** LEFT seems slightly better because it moves me away from the enemy at (8, 2) and directly towards the open area leading to (4, 7). It also clears the path UP for the turn after. If I go DOWN, I am sandwiched between my body (above) and the wall/enemy (below/left). If I go LEFT, I have an open field to the left and up.\n\n    *   **Wait, let's reconsider (2, 3).** It is isolated and might be hard to get if Snake #1 turns back.

It is in a wide open space.\n        *   To get to (4, 7), I need to go LEFT.\n        *   So, **LEFT** is the correct directional choice to start the path to (4, 7).\n\n6.  **Safety Check:**\n    *   (6, 4) is empty (based on previous turn board state: Row 4 was mostly empty).\n    *   It is not a wall.\n    *   It is not my body (my body is at (7, 5) and (7, 6)).\n    *   Enemy is at (8, 2), nowhere near (6, 4).\n    *   Move is safe.\n\nPlan:\nMove LEFT towards (6, 4).

It is close to the (2, 3) apple (distance 5). It is also between me and the (9, 8) apple. I should generally move away from the enemy to avoid future head-on collisions or being cornered. Moving LEFT puts more distance between me and (8, 3).\n    *   **Path Analysis:**\n        *   To reach (4, 7): Need to go UP and LEFT. Moving **UP** or **LEFT** is good.\n        *   To reach (2, 3): Need to go LEFT and DOWN. Moving **LEFT** or **DOWN** is good.\n        *   **UP vs LEFT vs DOWN:**\n            *   **UP (6, 5):** Moves me towards (4, 7). However, looking at the board, moving UP puts me closer to row 5/6/7. I see \"T\" at (7, 5) and (6, 5)? No, wait. My body is at (7, 5). If I move UP to (6, 5), I am clear of my own body. However, moving UP keeps me at X=6. Moving LEFT to (5, 4) reduces the distance to BOTH apples (Reduces X distance to (4, 7) and (2, 3)).\n            *   **LEFT (5, 4):** This move is optimal for closing the gap to both (4, 7) and (2, 3). It also moves me away from Snake #1 (currently at X=8). It keeps the path UP and DOWN open for next turn.\n            *   **DOWN (6, 3):** This moves me towards (2, 3) but away from (4, 7). It also brings me closer to the Y=2 row where Snake #1's tail is (at X=4..8). While not immediately fatal, it's slightly more constrained horizontally (closer to the wall at X=0) than staying near the center/left.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    *   **LEFT** is the safest and most versatile move. It balances the approach to the two closest apples (4, 7) and (2, 3), maintains distance from the enemy snake at (8, 3), and keeps the most future options open (can go UP, DOWN, or continue LEFT next turn).\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Moving RIGHT to (9,3) would put me against the right wall with fewer escape options.\n\n## Long-term Plan\n\nPriority is to move LEFT to (7,3) this turn. From there, I should continue toward the apple at (2,3) which is the closest. I need to be mindful of the enemy snake's movements and avoid head-on collisions. The apple at (9,8) is farthest from the enemy and could be a safer target, but the apple at (2,3) is closest. I should maintain flexibility and avoid getting trapped in corners.\n\nLEFT",

This move:\n- Takes me toward the apple at (2,3) which is 4 cells away\n- Puts me closer to the apple at (1,2) at distance 6\n- Maintains distance from the enemy snake\n- Keeps me away from the walls\n- Provides good flexibility for future moves\n\nThe enemy snake at (5,4) could move LEFT to (4,4), UP to (5,5), or RIGHT to (6,4). Moving RIGHT to (6,4) would put the enemy in the same cell where my body segment currently is at (6,3), but since that segment will move away when I move LEFT, the enemy would be safe.\n\n## Strategy Decision\n\nI should move **LEFT** to (6,3). This is the only safe move available and positions me well to continue toward the apple at (2,3) on future turns.\n\n## Long-term Plan\n\nI need to continue moving LEFT to reach the apple at (2,3) which is the closest target. From (6,3), I can move LEFT to (5,3), then LEFT to (4,3), and so on until I reach (2,3). I should be mindful of the enemy snake's movements and avoid head-on collisions. The apple at (1,2) is also relatively close and could be a secondary target if the enemy blocks my path to (2,3).\n\nLEFT",

Keeps options open (can go UP to 4,7 or DOWN to 2,3).\n    *   **UP (5, 5):** Open. Moves towards (4, 7). Good.\n    *   **DOWN (5, 3):** Open. Moves towards (2, 3). Good.\n\n    *   **Analysis:**\n        *   The apple at (4, 7) is at distance 3 from (4, 4) via UP. From (5, 5) it's distance 2.\n        *   The apple at (2, 3) is at distance 3 from (4, 4) via DOWN. From (5, 3) it's distance 3.\n        *   The apple at (1, 2) is closer from (4, 4) (distance 5) than from (5, 5) (distance 7) or (5, 3) (distance 5).\n        *   The apple at (9, 8) is far for all.\n        *   The apple at (0, 8) is far.\n\n    *   **Risk Assessment:**\n        *   **Snake #1:** Head at (8, 3) or (9, 3). It is very close to my potential path if I go DOWN. If I go DOWN to (5, 3), Snake #1 is at (8, 3) or (9, 3).\n            *   If I am at (5, 3) and Snake #1 is at (8, 3), Snake #1 might move LEFT (to 7, 3) or UP (to 8, 4) or DOWN (to 8, 2) or RIGHT (to 9, 3).\n            *   If I go DOWN to (5, 3), I am closing the gap to Snake #1 slightly (Y difference is 0 or 1). X difference is 3.\n            *   If I go UP to (5, 5), I am moving away from Snake #1.\n            *   If I go LEFT to (4, 4), I am moving away from Snake #1 in X, but staying same Y range.\n\n    *   **Contingency:**\n        *   If I go **LEFT (4, 4)**:\n            *   Next turn options: UP (4, 5), DOWN (4, 3), LEFT (3, 4).\n            *   (4, 5) is open. (4, 3) is open. (3, 4) is open.\n            *   This is the most flexible move. It centralizes me between the two closest apples and spreads the risk.\n        *   If I go **UP (5, 5)**:\n            *   Next turn options: UP (5, 6), DOWN (5, 4 - self body), LEFT (4, 5), RIGHT (6, 5).\n            *   (6, 5) is open (since my tail moved from 7,4).\n            *   (5, 4) is blocked (my body is there).\n            *   So 3 options. Good.\n        *   If I go **DOWN (5, 3)**:\n            *   Next turn options: DOWN (5, 2) -> **DANGER** (Snake #1 body likely there or moves there).\n            *   LEFT (4, 3), UP (5, 4 - self body), RIGHT (6, 3).\n            *   (5, 4) blocked.\n            *   (5, 2) is very risky.\n            *   So 2 safe options (LEFT, RIGHT). Less flexible.\n\n    *   **Decision:**\n        *   **LEFT (4, 4)** is the best move. It moves me towards the center of gravity for apples (4,7 and 2,3), increases distance from the enemy (who is at X=8), and provides the most escape routes.\n\n    *   **Long-term plan:** Move towards the cluster of apples at (4, 7) and (2, 3). Monitor Snake #1 moving left. Avoid getting trapped near the left wall (X=0) until necessary. Eat (4, 7) or (2, 3).\n\nLEFT",

Moving RIGHT to (5,4) would put the enemy in the same cell where my body segment currently is at (5,3), but since that segment will move away when I move LEFT, the enemy would be safe.\n\n## Strategy Decision\n\nI should move **LEFT** to (5,3).

Body at [(6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2)].\n    *   **Simultaneous Movement:** I must account for where the enemy *head* will be.\n    *   **Immediate Threat:** If I move **DOWN** to (3, 3), I die. The enemy snake is at (5, 3), but the apple at (2, 3) is a prime target. The enemy will almost certainly move **LEFT** to (4, 3) to reach that apple. If the enemy moves to (4, 3) and I move to (3, 3), I collide with the enemy's body (specifically, the segment that was at (5, 3) moves to (4, 3)). Wait, actually, if the enemy moves from (5, 3) to (4, 3), their old tail stays, but their head moves to (4, 3). Moving into (3, 3) is safe from the *head*, but the apple is at (2, 3). However, the square (4, 3) is likely where the enemy head will be. If I stay at (3, 4), I am safe from the enemy's immediate path.\n\n2.  **Evaluating Moves from (3, 4):**\n    *   **UP (3, 5):** Open space. This moves me toward the apple at (4, 7) and (0, 8). It also keeps me away from the enemy cluster at Y=2-3.\n    *   **DOWN (3, 3):** Unsafe. While the square is physically empty, the apple is at (2, 3). The enemy at (5, 3) will aggressively pursue it. If the enemy moves LEFT to (4, 3), they control that column. If the enemy moves UP to (5, 4), that's occupied. They will go LEFT. By moving DOWN to (3, 3), I enter a contested zone and block my own retreat.\n    *   **LEFT (2, 4):** Open space. Moves toward the apple at (1, 2) and (0, 8). Good option.\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 4):** Blocked by my own body.\n\n3.  **Comparison (UP vs. LEFT):**\n    *   **Strategy:** We need to reach 50 apples or be the last survivor. The enemy has 5 apples, I have 2. I need to catch up.\n    *   **UP (3, 5):** This move isolates me from the enemy's current position (Y=3). It opens up the northern board. From (3, 5), I can access (3, 6), (2, 5), or (4, 5) next turn. It positions me to eventually claim the top-left apples.\n    *   **LEFT (2, 4):** This moves me horizontally closer to the enemy's axis (Y=3) and the apple at (1, 2). It is slightly riskier because it keeps me at Y=4, while the enemy is at Y=3 (and might move UP next turn).\n    *   **Decision:** Moving **UP** to (3, 5) is the safest and most strategic play. It avoids the immediate conflict zone in the bottom-left (where the enemy is hunting) and secures vertical space.\n\n4.  **Plan:**\n    *   Move **UP** to (3, 5).\n    *   From there, aim for the apples at (0, 8) and (4, 7).\n    *   Monitor enemy movements to ensure they don't cut off my path.\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**",

Safe from walls and body.\n\n    *   **Enemy Interaction:**\n        *   Enemy head is at `(1, 3)` with a body spanning X=2 to 8 on Y=3. My potential moves are on Y=6, 7, and 8. The distance is significant (minimum 3 units). Even if the enemy moves UP towards the apple at `(1, 2)` (to `(1, 4)`) or attempts to hunt, they cannot reach my potential positions in one turn.

Eating this increases my score to 5, keeping me in the game. This is an immediate, safe point.\n        *   **RIGHT (5, 7):** Leads to an empty space. Doesn't offer an immediate point.\n    *   **Conclusion:** `DOWN` to `(4, 6)` is the superior move. It is safe and guarantees an apple, maintaining pressure on the leader. The alternative is to move away from the apple, which is strategically disadvantageous given the score deficit.\n\n4.  **Long-term Plan:**\n    *   Eat the apple at `(4, 6)` now.\n    *   From `(4, 6)`, I will likely be able to move to `(3, 6)` or `(5, 6)`.

Body segments are `[(4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5)]`.\n    *   **Enemy Snake (1):** Head is at `(1, 2)`. Body extends from `(1, 3)` to `(7, 3)`.\n    *   **Apples:** Apples are at `(0, 8), (9, 8), (0, 7), (3, 1), (5, 5)`.\n    *   **Scores:** I have 5 apples (after eating last turn). Enemy has 7 apples. I am trailing by 2.\n\n2.  **Safety Check (Simultaneous Movement Prediction):**\n    *   **My Potential Moves:**\n        *   **UP (4, 7):** Currently occupied by my own body segment (neck). If I move UP, my head will move into the cell occupied by my previous head position (which becomes part of the body). This counts as hitting myself. **Unsafe.**\n        *   **DOWN (4, 5):** This cell is empty on the current board. It is within bounds. It is not occupied by my body. It is safe *unless* the enemy moves there.\n        *   **LEFT (3, 6):** Currently occupied by my own body segment. This would also be a collision. **Unsafe.**\n        *   **RIGHT (5, 6):** Currently empty. Safe.\n\n    *   **Enemy Interaction (Hypothetical Scenarios):**\n        *   The enemy is at `(1, 2)`. The closest apple to them is likely `(3, 1)` (down and right) or `(0, 7)` (up and left). They are 2 steps away from `(3, 1)`.\n        *   My potential safe moves are `(4, 5)` and `(5, 6)`.\n        *   The enemy is 3+ units away from `(4, 5)` and `(5, 6)` in Manhattan distance. It is impossible for the enemy to reach either of these cells in a single turn.\n\n3.  **Strategy & Scoring:**\n    *   **Move Evaluation:**\n        *   **DOWN (4, 5):** This cell contains an Apple ('A'). Eating it brings my score to 6, closing the gap with the enemy. It is a safe move.\n        *   **RIGHT (5, 6):** This is an empty cell. It doesn't grant points immediately.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Moving **DOWN** to `(4, 5)` is the best move. It is safe, guaranteed to score a point, and moves me towards the center of the board.\n\n4.  **Long-term Plan:**\n    *   Eat the apple at `(4, 5)`.\n    *   After eating, my tail will grow. I will likely need to navigate towards the cluster of apples at the top left `(0, 8), (0, 7)` or the one at `(9, 8)`.\n    *   Avoid the enemy's body which is heavily clustered around Y=3.\n\nDOWN\n**END RATIONALE**",

The RIGHT move could lead to dangerous encounters with the enemy snake and takes me away from the closest apples.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter moving to (0,5), I should continue moving UP the left edge toward (0,7) and (0,8).

My body consists of `[(5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7)]`.\n2.  **Move Evaluation:**\n    *   **UP (5, 7):** This cell is currently occupied by my own body at `(4, 7)` (since my body is listed as `(4, 7)` and `(3, 7)`). Wait, let's check the board state carefully. The board shows `T` at `(4, 7)` and `(3, 7)`. The snake list confirms `[(5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7)]`. The body segment at `(4, 7)` is a neighbor to `(5, 7)`. However, the body segment at `(5, 5)` is behind the head `(5, 6)`. Moving UP to `(5, 7)` moves away from `(5, 5)`, so it is safe from self-collision unless I loop around.\n    *   **LEFT (4, 6):** This cell is currently occupied by my own body. Specifically, `(4, 6)` is the 3rd segment in my body list. Moving here is suicide. **Unsafe.**\n    *   **RIGHT (6, 6):** This cell is currently empty. It is safe.\n    *   **DOWN (5, 5):** This cell is currently occupied by my own body (the 2nd segment). Moving here is suicide. **Unsafe.**\n\n3.  **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at `(0, 4)`. Body extends from `(0, 2)` to `(4, 3)`.\n    *   If Enemy moves UP to `(0, 5)`, it is empty.\n    *   If Enemy moves DOWN to `(0, 3)`, it is empty.\n    *   If Enemy moves RIGHT to `(1, 4)`, it is empty.\n    *   Enemy is not a threat for a head-on collision this turn.\n\n4.  **Strategy & Analysis:**\n    *   I am currently trapped in a corner-like structure. My body blocks LEFT and DOWN. My head is at `(5, 6)`.\n    *   I have two valid moves: UP and RIGHT.\n    *   **RIGHT** moves towards `(6, 6)`. This moves towards the apples at `(9, 8)` and `(5, 2)`. This seems like the direction to go to open up the board.\n    *   **UP** moves to `(5, 7)`. Looking at the board, row 7 has `A` at `(0, 7)` and `T` at `(3, 7)` and `(4, 7)`. My body is at `(4, 7)`. Moving to `(5, 7)` puts me next to `(4, 7)`. The apple at `(0, 7)` is far. The apple at `(9, 8)` is also far.\n    *   Let's look at the long-term plan. I want to get to `(9, 8)` or `(5, 2)`.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** seems to be the most logical step to get out of the left side of the board.\n    *   If I move **UP**, I am moving closer to the top wall and my own body at `(4, 7)`. I might get trapped.\n    *   If I move **RIGHT**, I have options for the next turn.\n    *   Let's verify safety of **RIGHT**. Target (6, 6) is empty.\n    *   Let's verify safety of **UP**. Target (5, 7) is empty on the board map (the T is at 4,7). Wait, the board state shows:\n        `7 A . . T T . . . . .`\n        The T's are at `(3, 7)` and `(4, 7)`. So `(5, 7)` is empty.\n        However, the map shows `T` at `(4, 7)`. My body is at `(4, 7)`.\n        So `(5, 7)` is safe.\n\n    *   Let's re-evaluate the options.\n        *   **RIGHT (6, 6):** Moves towards the center/right. Towards apples at `(9, 8)` and `(5, 2)`.\n        *   **UP (5, 7):** Moves towards the top. Towards apple at `(0, 7)` and `(0, 8)`.\n    *   The apple at `(9, 8)` is worth 7 steps.\n    *   The apple at `(5, 2)` is worth 4 steps (down).\n    *   The apple at `(0, 7)` is 5 steps.\n    *   I am currently blocked DOWN and LEFT. I need to avoid getting trapped in the corner `(5, 6) -> (5, 7)`.\n    *   If I go UP, I might get blocked if I need to turn. If I go RIGHT, I have the whole board to my right.\n    *   Also, there is an apple at `(5, 2)` directly below my current path, but I cannot go DOWN because my body is there. However, if I go RIGHT, I can potentially loop around or come back down later? No, going RIGHT starts moving me away from `(5, 2)`.\n    *   But wait, `(5, 2)` is an apple. If I go DOWN, I die.\n    *   If I go RIGHT, I am at `(6, 6)`.\n    *   If I go UP, I am at `(5, 7)`.\n    *   Let's look at the enemy at `(0, 4)`. They are far away.\n    *   Let's look at the apples.\n        *   `(3, 1)`: Distance 8 (Manhattan from 5,6).\n        *   `(5, 2)`: Distance 4.\n        *   `(9, 8)`: Distance 7.\n        *   `(0, 7)`: Distance 5.\n        *   `(0, 8)`: Distance 6.\n    *   The closest apple is `(5, 2)`. I cannot go there directly. I need to go around.\n    *   If I go **RIGHT**, I can go DOWN (to 6,5), LEFT (back to 5,5) - wait, 5,5 is body. So I can go DOWN to 6,5. Then LEFT to 5,5? No, 5,5 is my body from previous turn. Wait, if I move RIGHT, my tail moves. The cell (5,5) might become empty?\n        *   Current body: (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7).\n        *   If I move RIGHT to (6,6):\n        *   New head: (6,6).\n        *   New body: (5,6) (old head), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7).\n        *   So (3,7) becomes empty.\n        *   So (5,5) becomes the new body segment 2. (4,5) becomes segment 3.\n        *   So (5,5) is still occupied.\n        *   So I cannot move LEFT from (6,6) back to (5,6) immediately (that's the old head, which is part of my new body).\n        *   Wait, if I am at (6,6), (5,6) is occupied (it's my 2nd segment).\n        *   So from (6,6), I can go UP (6,7), DOWN (6,5), RIGHT (7,6).\n    *   If I go **UP** to (5,7):\n        *   New head: (5,7).\n        *   New body: (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7).\n        *   (3,7) becomes empty.\n        *   From (5,7), I can go UP (5,8), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7). DOWN is (5,6) (occupied).\n        *   Left (4,7) is occupied by my body. So I can go UP or RIGHT.\n    *   Comparing options:\n        *   **RIGHT** to (6,6): Options next turn are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. (LEFT blocked by my body).\n        *   **UP** to (5,7): Options next turn are UP, RIGHT. (LEFT blocked by my body, DOWN blocked by my body).\n        *   **RIGHT** gives me 3 options. **UP** gives me 2 options.\n        *   **RIGHT** moves me towards the right side of the board where apples `(9, 8)` and `(5, 2)` (indirectly) are.\n        *   **UP** moves me towards the top left where apples `(0, 7)` and `(0, 8)` are.\n    *   Is there a way to reach (5, 2)?\n        *   I am at (5, 6). I cannot go down. I must go right or up.\n        *   If I go right to (6, 6). Next I go down to (6, 5). Then down to (6, 4). Then down to (6, 3). Then left to (5, 3). Then down to (5, 2).\n        *   This path is valid.\n    *   Is there a way to reach (9, 8)?\n        *   Right to (6, 6). Right to (7, 6). Right to (8, 6). Right to (9, 6). Up to (9, 7). Up to (9, 8).\n        *   This path is valid.\n    *   Is there a way to reach (0, 7)?\n        *   Up to (5, 7). Up to (5, 8). Left to (4, 8). Left to (3, 8). Left to (2, 8). Left to (1, 8). Left to (0, 8). Down to (0, 7).\n        *   This path is valid.\n    *   The apple at (5, 2) is the closest, but blocked by my body. I need to move away to loop back.\n    *   The apple at (9, 8) is the \"uncontested\" one according to my previous thought process (which was based on being at 5,5). I am now at 5,6. The logic still holds.\n    *   The apple at (0, 8) is also there.\n    *   I am currently at Y=6. The apple at (9, 8) is at Y=8. The apple at (0, 8) is at Y=8. The apple at (5, 2) is at Y=2.\n    *   I am blocked downwards. I must move UP or RIGHT.\n    *   Moving RIGHT seems to be the safer move to avoid the corner near the top wall. If I go UP to (5, 7), I am closer to the top wall (Y=9). If I make a mistake later, I might get trapped.\n    *   Moving RIGHT keeps me at Y=6. I can then go UP or DOWN.\n    *   Let's check safety of (6, 6) again. It is empty.\n    *   Let's check safety of (5, 7). It is empty.\n    *   Enemy snake #1 is at (0, 4). It is not moving towards me.\n    *   I will move RIGHT.\n\n5.  **Decision:** Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 6) is the best move. It provides the most options for the next turn and moves towards the apples on the right side of the board while keeping me away from the top wall.\n\nRIGHT",

However, looking at the board, moving DOWN to `(6, 5)` leads to a potential path that ends at the bottom wall or forces a turn. Also, looking at the \"Last Rationale\", the preferred target was `(9, 8)` or `(5, 2)`.\n    *   **UP (6, 7):** Moving UP puts me on row 7. On this row, there is an apple at `(0, 7)` and my body at `(4, 7)`. Moving UP takes me towards `(0, 7)` but also gets me closer to the top wall and the left-side apples. However, if I want to go for `(9, 8)`, going UP first to align Y=7 or Y=8 seems necessary.\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 6):** Moving RIGHT keeps me on row 6. This keeps me on the path to the right side of the board where the apple at `(9, 8)` is. From here, I can continue moving right or turn up.\n    *   Let's look at the distances to the apples on the right side:\n        *   `(9, 8)`: Distance is |9-7| + |8-6| = 2 + 2 = 4 steps (if I go Right then Up then Right...).\n    *   Let's look at the distances to apples on the left:\n        *   `(0, 8)`: Distance is |0-7| + |8-6| = 7 + 2 = 9 steps.\n        *   `(0, 7)`: Distance is 7 + 1 = 8 steps.\n    *   The apples on the right are closer.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** to `(7, 6)` allows me to continue towards `(9, 8)`. If I go UP to `(6, 7)`, I can still reach `(9, 8)` but I have to be careful about the gap between `(4, 7)` (my body) and `(6, 7)`.\n    *   If I move **RIGHT**, I maintain my distance from the top wall and my own body at `(4, 7)`. This seems like the safest way to extend towards the right-side apples.\n\n5.  **Decision:** Moving **RIGHT** is the best move to pursue the closest apples on the right side of the board while keeping options open.\n\nRIGHT",

My body segments are at `(6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6)`.\n2.  **Evaluate Moves:**\n    *   **UP:** Target `(7, 7)`. This cell is empty and on the board. It is safe.\n    *   **DOWN:** Target `(7, 5)`. This cell is empty and on the board. It is safe.\n    *   **LEFT:** Target `(6, 6)`. This is the segment immediately following my head. According to the rules, moving directly backwards into your own body counts as hitting yourself and you die. This move is **Unsafe**.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Target `(8, 6)`. This cell is empty and on the board. It is safe.\n3.  **Strategy:**\n    *   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head is at `(0, 6)`. It is far away and moving along the left edge. No immediate threat.\n    *   **Apples:**\n        *   Right side: `(9, 8)` is 2 units X and 2 units Y away.\n        *   Left side: `(0, 8)` and `(0, 7)` are far away (approx. 8+ steps).\n        *   Bottom side: `(5, 2)` and `(3, 1)` are also far away.\n    *   **Pathfinding:**\n        *   Moving **RIGHT** to `(8, 6)` gets me closer to `(9, 8)` and `(9, 8)` is a valid apple. From `(8, 6)`, I can go UP twice to reach `(8, 8)`, then RIGHT to `(9, 8)`.\n        *   Moving **UP** to `(7, 7)` is also a valid move. However, looking at my body, I have a segment at `(4, 6)` and `(4, 7)`. Moving UP to `(7, 7)` keeps me on the board but I am slightly closer to the left side.\n    *   **Comparison:** Moving RIGHT seems the most direct path to the closest high-value apple (9,8). It also keeps me relatively centered in the board.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Target the apple at (9, 8) on the right side. Approach by moving RIGHT and UP, avoiding the left side where the enemy snake is, and watching out for my own tail growth.\n\nRIGHT",

Indices 0 to 9.\n            *   Index 0: '1'\n            *   ...\n            *   Index 6: 'A'\n            *   Index 7: '.'\n            *   Index 8: '.'\n            *   Index 9: '.'\n            *   So (8, 7) is Empty.\n    *   Therefore, **UP (8, 7) is Empty**.\n    *   **DOWN (8, 5):** Empty.\n    *   **RIGHT (9, 6):** Empty.\n    *   **LEFT (7, 6):** My body.\n\n4.  **Re-evaluating Safe Moves based on \"Apples at\" list:**\n    *   Apples are at (0, 8), (9, 8), (3, 1), (5, 2), (6, 7).\n    *   My Head: (8, 6).\n    *   **Target (9, 8):** Manhattan distance = |9-8| + |8-6| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n    *   **Target (6, 7):** Manhattan distance = |6-8| + |7-6| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n    *   **Target (0, 8):** Very far.\n    *   **Target (5, 2) / (3, 1):** Very far.\n\n    *   **Moving RIGHT (to 9, 6):**\n        *   Next step towards (9, 8). I will be at (9, 6). From there I can go UP UP to (9, 8).\n        *   This puts me near the wall. I must be careful not to get trapped.\n    *   **Moving UP (to 8, 7):**\n        *   Moves towards (6, 7) and (9, 8).\n        *   I will be at (8, 7). From there I can go LEFT to (7, 7), then UP to (7, 8), LEFT to (6, 8), DOWN to (6, 7) or similar.\n        *   (8, 7) is more central than (9, 6).\n\n    *   **Enemy Threat:**\n        *   Enemy #1 at (0, 7). Likely to move UP to (0, 8) to eat the apple there.\n        *   Enemy #1 will not reach me.\n\n    *   **Decision:**\n        *   Avoid LEFT (Backwards).\n        *   Choose between UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n        *   DOWN (8, 5) moves away from *all* apples.\n        *   UP (8, 7) moves towards (6, 7) and (9, 8).\n        *   RIGHT (9, 6) moves towards (9, 8).\n\n    *   Let's look at the visual board again for Row 6: `T . . . . T T T 0 .`\n        *   My head is at index 8 (x=8). The 'T's are at indices 5, 6, 7 (x=5,6,7).\n        *   My body extends down to y=5 at x=5.\n        *   If I go UP to (8, 7), I am clear.\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (9, 6), I am clear.\n\n    *   **Long Term Plan:** The apple at (9, 8) is \"high value\" because it's on the edge but accessible. The apple at (6, 7) is accessible. The apple at (0, 8) is for the enemy.\n    *   If I go RIGHT, I risk trapping myself against the wall. If I go UP, I remain flexible.\n    *   However, going RIGHT to (9, 6) commits to the right side. The enemy is on the left.\n    *   Let's check the prompt's \"Long-term plan\" from the previous turn. It said: \"Target the apple at (9, 8) on the right side. Approach by moving RIGHT and UP...\".\n    *   The previous move was RIGHT (to 8, 6). To continue the approach to (9, 8), I should go RIGHT again to (9, 6).\n    *   Is (9, 6) safe? Yes.\n    *   Is (8, 7) safe? Yes.\n    *   Which is better? (9, 6) gets me closer to the specific target (9, 8) mentioned in the plan. (8, 7) is more flexible but might delay reaching (9, 8).\n    *   However, looking at the board state `T . . . . T T T 0 .` at y=6, if I go RIGHT to (9, 6), I am at the edge. If I go UP to (8, 7), I am in open space.\n    *   Let's reconsider the \"Apples at\" list. (6, 7) is also a valid apple.\n    *   (8, 6) -> UP to (8, 7).\n        *   From (8, 7), I can go LEFT to (7, 7), then UP to (7, 8), LEFT to (6, 8), DOWN to (6, 7) to eat.\n        *   Or (8, 7) -> UP to (8, 8), then LEFT to (7, 8), LEFT to (6, 8), DOWN to (6, 7).\n    *   (8, 6) -> RIGHT to (9, 6).\n        *   From (9, 6), I can go UP to (9, 7), UP to (9, 8) to eat.\n        *   This is a straight line. 2 moves.\n    *   (8, 6) -> UP to (8, 7).\n        *   From (8, 7) to (6, 7) is 2 moves left.\n        *   From (8, 7) to (9, 8) is UP then RIGHT (2 moves).\n        *   From (8, 7) to (9, 8) is also valid.\n\n    *   **Decision Factor: Safety vs Speed.**\n        *   Going RIGHT to (9, 6) puts me against the wall. If I don't eat the apple immediately, I might be forced to turn back or go up. If I go up to (9, 7), I am still against the wall. If I then need to escape, I only have LEFT.\n        *   Going UP to (8, 7) keeps me in the open. I can still go RIGHT later to (9, 8) if I want.\n        *   However, the previous plan explicitly targeted (9, 8). The user provided that plan.\n        *   Let's look at the \"Last Rationale\" again. It says: \"Moving **RIGHT** to `(8, 6)` gets me closer to `(9, 8)`... From `(8, 6)`, I can go UP twice to reach `(8, 8)`, then RIGHT to `(9, 8)`.\"\n        *   Wait, if I am at (8, 6) and go UP twice: (8, 7) -> (8, 8). Then RIGHT to (9, 8).\n        *   So the plan was NOT to go RIGHT immediately, but to go UP.\n        *   The user typed \"RIGHT\" as the move for the *previous* turn. That got me to (8, 6).\n        *   Now I am at (8, 6).\n        *   The plan says: \"From `(8, 6)`, I can go UP twice to reach `(8, 8)`, then RIGHT to `(9, 8)`.\"\n        *   So I should go UP now.\n\n    *   **Re-evaluating Safety of UP (8, 7):**\n        *   Enemy #1 is at (0, 7).\n        *   If I go UP to (8, 7), is it safe? Yes.\n        *   Is there a head-on collision risk? Enemy is far away.\n        *   Is there a body collision? No.\n        *   Is it off board? No.\n\n    *   **Re-evaluating Safety of RIGHT (9, 6):**\n        *   Safe. But wall.\n\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   UP: Flexible, follows the trajectory towards both apples (6,7) and (9,8).\n        *   RIGHT: Committed to wall, faster to (9,8) but less flexible.\n        *   Given the standard snake strategy, keeping away from walls is usually better unless an apple is adjacent.\n        *   The apple is not adjacent.\n        *   The plan \"From (8, 6), I can go UP twice...\" strongly suggests UP.\n\n    *   **Wait, let me check the \"Apples at\" list again.** `(6, 7)` is an apple.\n    *   If I go UP to (8, 7), I am at y=7.\n    *   The apple (6, 7) is at x=6, y=7.\n    *   I could go LEFT to (7, 7), then LEFT to (6, 7) to eat immediately in the next turn (after this turn).\n    *   This seems like a very good move. Eating an apple grows the snake.\n    *   Eating an apple means the tail doesn't move. This is crucial for safety.\n    *   If I go UP to (8, 7), I am 2 steps away from (6, 7). If I go LEFT now, I can't because (7, 6) is my body.\n    *   So UP is the only way to get closer to (6, 7).\n    *   (8, 6) -> UP -> (8, 7).\n    *   (8, 7) -> LEFT -> (7, 7). (Safe? My body will have moved. Tail was at (4, 5). By the time I move to (7, 7), the tail moves to (5, 5). (7, 7) is clear).\n    *   (7, 7) -> LEFT -> (6, 7). Eat apple.\n    *   This looks like a solid plan.\n\n    *   Let's double check the board coordinates.\n        *   My head: (8, 6).\n        *   UP: (8, 7).\n        *   Visual Row 7: `1 . . . . . A . . .`\n        *   Indices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n        *   Index 7 is '.'. Index 8 is '.'.\n        *   So (8, 7) is Empty.\n        *   Index 6 is 'A'. So (6, 7) is an apple.\n        *   My visual check of Row 7 confirms an apple at x=6.\n\n    *   **Final Check:**\n        *   **Move UP to (8, 7):**\n            *   Is it on board? Yes.\n            *   Is it my body? No (Body is at y=6 and below).\n            *   Is it enemy body? No.\n            *   Does it enable future moves? Yes, allows approach to (6, 7) or (9, 8).\n\n    *   **Why not RIGHT?**\n        *   (9, 6). Visual Row 6: `T . . . . T T T 0 .`\n        *   The last character is `.`. So (9, 6) is Empty.\n        *   (9, 6) is safe.\n        *   From (9, 6), I can go UP to (9, 7), UP to (9, 8) to eat.\n        *   However, (9, 8) is the border corner. Eating there leaves me with limited exits (only LEFT or DOWN).\n        *   (6, 7) is more central. Eating at (6, 7) leaves me with many exits.\n        *   Targeting (6, 7) is safer.\n\n    *   **Why not DOWN?**\n        *   (8, 5). Empty.\n        *   Moves away from all apples.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:** UP is the best move to approach the apple at (6, 7) while keeping options open for (9, 8).\n\n    *   **Self-Correction/Refinement:**\n        *   The user provided a \"Last Rationale\" that recommended RIGHT.\n        *   However, the user also asked me to \"think out loud\" and \"consider... keeping future options open\".\n        *   The user's previous move (RIGHT to 8,6) was correct to get to that position.\n        *   Now at 8,6, the user's logic \"From (8, 6), I can go UP twice\" confirms UP is a valid option in their head.\n        *   I should stick to the optimal strategy which favors safety and options. UP provides better options than RIGHT.\n        *   I will choose UP.\n\n    *   **Wait, is there a snake at (8, 7)?**\n        *   Visual Row 7: `1 . . . . .

Moving here would be moving backwards into myself, which kills me.\n- **DOWN (9, 7):** This cell appears empty on the board.

However, this moves me into a corner with limited escape routes.\n- **RIGHT (10, 8):** This is off the board (x=10 is beyond 9), so this move kills me.\n\nWait, I need to reconsider. The board shows my head at (9,8) in the last turn's state. But I just ate an apple at (9,8). Let me check the current position again.\n\nActually, looking at the turn number (32), my head should be at (9,8) after my last move. The body listed is [(8,8), (8,7)...]. So from (9,8), my options are:\n- LEFT to (8,8) - that's my body, I die\n- DOWN to (9,7) - appears empty, but is this near any apples? No immediate apples visible.\n- UP to (9,9) - corner, empty\n- RIGHT - off board, die\n\nSo my only safe options are DOWN or UP. Between these, DOWN (9,7) seems better as it keeps me more mobile and less cornered than UP (9,9). From (9,7), I can potentially maneuver toward other apples like (6,7) or (8,2).\n\nDOWN",

My body occupies a cluster in the top right of the board: [(9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7)].\n2.  **Potential Moves**:\n    *   **UP (8, 6)**: This cell is currently empty. However, it is very close to my own body (segments at (9, 6) and (8, 7)). Moving here creates a tight bottleneck.\n    *   **DOWN (8, 4)**: This cell is empty. It moves me away from my body and opens up the lower part of the board.\n    *   **LEFT (7, 5)**: This cell is empty. It moves me centrally and towards the closest apple at (6, 7) (which is currently blocked by Snake #1 but might open up) and the cluster of apples at (5, 2), (4, 5), (3, 1).\n    *   **RIGHT (9, 5)**: Blocked by my own body. Immediate death.\n3.  **Enemy Snake #1**: Located at (4, 6). It is very long and currently blocking the path to the apple at (6, 7).\n4.  **Strategy**:\n    *   I need to navigate around my own body to find open space.\n    *   Moving UP or LEFT feels risky because of the proximity to my body. If I move UP to (8, 6), I am sandwiched between (9, 6) and (8, 7). If I move LEFT to (7, 5), I am approaching the left side of my body at (8, 7) and (8, 8).\n    *   Moving DOWN to (8, 4) seems the safest. It moves me into open territory and away from the tight cluster of my body at the top. From (8, 4), I can continue down to reach (8, 2) (an apple) or pivot left to go towards (4, 5).\n\n**Decision**: I will move **DOWN** to (8, 4) to ensure safety and open up options to reach the apples at (8, 2) and below.\n\nDOWN",

This move **EATS APPLE** and gives me immediate score advantage by gaining 1 point. While other moves might position me better for future apples, the immediate benefit of collecting an apple is significant, especially with the enemy snake close by. After eating this apple, I will have 11 apples compared to the enemy's 6, giving me a substantial lead. The position at (4,5) will still provide good access to the remaining apples at (3,1) and (5,2).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter eating the apple at (4,5), I should prioritize collecting the apple at (5,2) which will be 3 cells diagonally away from my new position. I need to be aware of the enemy snake at (8,5) and avoid head-on collisions while maintaining pressure on collecting apples. With the score now at 11-6 in my favor, I should continue to be aggressive in collecting apples while maintaining awareness of the enemy's position. I should avoid the left edge where my body is concentrated, and instead work toward the center of the board where more apples are located. After collecting (5,2), I should consider moving toward (3,1) and then (6,7), being mindful of the enemy snake's movements.\n\nDOWN",

This is the segment immediately behind my head. Moving here is a collision with myself (immediate death).\n        *   **DOWN**: Target `(8, 3)`. Inside the board. Check for collisions.\n        *   **LEFT**: Target `(7, 4)`. Inside the board. Check for collisions.\n        *   **RIGHT**: Target `(9, 4)`. Inside the board. Check for collisions.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Safety of Each Move:**\n    *   **UP (8, 5)**: **Blocked**. Moves into my own body segment.\n    *   **DOWN (8, 3)**: **Safe**. The board state shows `(8, 3)` as `.` (empty).\n    *   **LEFT (7, 4)**: **Safe**. The board state shows `(7, 4)` as `.` (empty).\n    *   **RIGHT (9, 4)**: **Safe**. The board state shows `(9, 4)` as `T` (my body), but wait, let's look closely at the board state provided in the prompt for column 9:\n        Row 4 (y=4): `T . . . . . . . . .` -> Index 9 is `.` (Empty). Wait, the prompt says: \"Board state: ... 4 T . . . . . . . . 0 .\" -> The `0` is at x=8 (my head). The cell at x=9, y=4 is `.` (Empty). So **RIGHT** is technically safe *initially*.\n\n3.  **Strategic Evaluation & Enemy Prediction (Turn 37):**\n    *   **Enemy Snake #1**: Head at `(4, 5)`. Body at `[(4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), ...]`.\n    *   *Prediction for Snake #1*: It is very long. It likely wants to circle or find food. Given the board state, if it moves **UP**, it hits its own body at `(4, 6)`. If it moves **RIGHT**, it dies (out of bounds). If it moves **DOWN** to `(4, 4)`, that is safe and opens up the bottom area. If it moves **LEFT** to `(3, 5)`, that is safe. **Crucially, Snake #1 cannot move UP.** This means it won't be moving into the space above its head this turn.\n\n    *   **Evaluating My Safe Moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT):**\n        *   **RIGHT (9, 4):**\n            *   Next turn I would be at `(9, 4)`.\n            *   Potential moves from there: LEFT (back to 8,4 - blocked by my tail moving there), UP (9,5 - blocked by my body), DOWN (9,3 - safe), RIGHT (10,4 - out of bounds).\n            *   This is a \"corner\" risk. If I go RIGHT, I have few safe exits next turn.\n            *   Also, `(9, 5)` is currently my body. My body will shift. If I go RIGHT, my tail moves from `(8, 8)` to `(8, 9)`? No, let's trace the shift:\n                `Head (8,4)` -> `(9,4)`\n                `Body (8,5)` -> `(8,4)`\n                `Body (9,5)` -> `(8,5)`\n                ...\n                `Tail (8,8)` -> `(8,7)`\n            *   So if I go RIGHT to `(9, 4)`, the cell `(9, 5)` becomes `(8, 5)` (my body).\n            *   If I stay at `(8, 4)` (DOWN), the cell `(9, 5)` becomes `(8, 5)` as well (since `(8, 5)` becomes `(8, 4)`).\n            *   The difference is my head position. `(9, 4)` is on the right edge. `(8, 4)` is one step inside.\n\n        *   **DOWN (8, 3):**\n            *   Head moves to `(8, 3)`.\n            *   This is a central column location.\n            *   Next turn options: LEFT `(7, 3)`, DOWN `(8, 2)` (Apple!), RIGHT `(9, 3)`.\n            *   **Apple at (8, 2)**. Moving DOWN sets me up to eat the apple at `(8, 2)` on the next turn (Turn 38).\n            *   This seems very promising.\n\n        *   **LEFT (7, 4):**\n            *   Head moves to `(7, 4)`.\n            *   Next turn options: LEFT `(6, 4)`, DOWN `(7, 3)`, UP `(7, 5)`.\n            *   This is also safe and central. However, it moves away from the apple at `(8, 2)`.\n\n    *   **Consolidating the Decision:**\n        *   **LEFT** is safe but moves away from the apple at `(8, 2)`.\n        *   **RIGHT** is safe but traps me near the wall.\n        *   **DOWN** is safe and moves me directly toward an apple at `(8, 2)`.\n\n    *   **One final check on collisions:**\n        *   Enemy #1 is at `(4, 5)`. It cannot move to `(8, 3)`.\n        *   My body is moving out of the way.\n        *   Therefore, **DOWN** is the best move.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Move **DOWN** to `(8, 3)`.\n    *   This secures a path to the apple at `(8, 2)` for the next turn and maintains central board control.\n\nDOWN",

My body is `[(8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)]`.\n\nI need to evaluate my possible moves for this turn (Turn 38):\n1.  **UP (8, 4)**: This cell is currently occupied by my own body. If I move up, I collide with myself. **Unsafe.**\n2.  **LEFT (7, 3)**: This cell is empty on the board state. It is inside the board. **Safe.**\n3.  **RIGHT (9, 3)**: This cell is empty on the board state. It is inside the board. **Safe.**\n4.  **DOWN (8, 2)**: This cell contains an apple `(A)`. It is inside the board. **Safe.**\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n*   **Enemy Snake #1**: Head at `(5, 5)`. It is currently in the top-left quadrant and is very long (11 apples). It is unlikely to reach me in the bottom-right quadrant this turn.\n*   **Apples**: The closest apples are `(8, 2)` (down), `(2, 1)` (far left), `(3, 1)` (far left), and `(5, 2)` (mid-left).\n    *   Moving **DOWN** to `(8, 2)` allows me to eat an apple immediately. This grows my snake, which is crucial for survival and score.\n    *   After eating at `(8, 2)`, my new head will be at `(8, 2)`. My tail will have moved from `(9, 8)` to `(8, 8)`. The space `(8, 3)` will become part of my body.\n    *   From `(8, 2)`, I can potentially move to `(8, 1)` (checking board... empty), `(9, 2)` (empty), or `(7, 2)` (empty). I will likely be able to continue towards `(2, 1)` or `(3, 1)` if needed.\n*   **Comparison**:\n    *   **LEFT (7, 3)**: Moves me horizontally but not towards the apple at `(8, 2)`. It sets up a path that might be slightly safer for cornering, but I lose the immediate point and growth.\n    *   **RIGHT (9, 3)**: Moves me towards the wall. While it might be safe for one turn, it is generally a bad idea to voluntarily corner yourself.\n    *   **DOWN (8, 2)**: Secures an apple immediately. Growth is priority #1.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI am currently safe. Moving **DOWN** to `(8, 2)` is the best move as it is safe and allows me to eat an apple, growing my snake and gaining a point.\n\nDOWN",

This move brings me closest to an apple - the apple at (5,2) is only 2 cells vertically below me. This is the most direct path to collecting an apple quickly. While RIGHT to (6,5) would also bring me close to (6,7) at 2 cells above, DOWN gives me the immediate advantage of being just 1 move away from (5,2) after this turn, whereas (6,7) would require more complex navigation. DOWN also keeps me in a good position to access other apples if I choose to prioritize (5,2) now. The move to UP would also give access to (6,7) but from a different angle, but DOWN provides the most immediate apple opportunity.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter moving to (5,4), I should prioritize collecting the apple at (5,2) which will be only 2 cells vertically below me.

I should avoid the left edge where my body is concentrated, and instead work toward the center and right side of the board where more apples are located. After collecting (5,2), I should consider moving toward (6,7) and then (8,2), being mindful of the enemy snake's movements and maintaining good mobility.\n\nDOWN",

The board state provided shows the state *before* my last move, where my head was at `(8, 3)` and the apple was at `(8, 2)`. I need to make a decision for Turn 39 based on the board state *after* my move.\n\nCurrent state analysis (Turn 39):\n1.  **My Position**:\n    *   Head: `(8, 2)`\n    *   Body: `[(8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9)]` (Assuming tail moved from `(9, 8)` to `(8, 8)`? No, wait. My body list provided was `[(8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)]`. The tail was `(9, 8)`.\n    *   Since I ate an apple at `(8, 2)`, I grew. My head is now `(8, 2)`. The previous head `(8, 3)` becomes the first body segment. The tail `(9, 8)` does *not* move.\n    *   My new body is: `[(8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)]`.\n    *   My new tail is `(9, 8)`.\n2.  **Apples**:\n    *   The apple at `(8, 2)` is gone.\n    *   Remaining apples: `(3, 1), (5, 2), (6, 7), (2, 1), (6, 1)`.\n3.  **Enemy Snake #1**:\n    *   Head: `(5, 4)`. Body: `[(5, 5), (4, 5), ...]`.\n    *   It will move this turn. It poses no immediate threat to `(8, 2)`.\n\nPossible moves from `(8, 2)`:\n*   **UP**: `(8, 3)`. This is my body. **Death**.\n*   **LEFT**: `(7, 2)`. Empty. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT**: `(9, 2)`. Empty. Safe.\n*   **DOWN**: `(8, 1)`. This contains an apple `(6, 1)`? No. Wait. Apples are at `(8, 1)`? No. Apples are at `(3, 1), (5, 2), (6, 7), (2, 1), (6, 1)`.\n    *   Looking at the board grid provided:\n    ```\n     2 . . . . . A . . 0 .  (Row 2)\n     1 . . A A . . A . . .  (Row 1)\n    ```\n    *   My head is at `(8, 2)`. Row 2 shows `A` at x=5. Row 1 shows apples at x=2, 3, 6.\n    *   So at `(8, 1)`, the board shows `.` (empty).\n    *   Therefore, **DOWN** to `(8, 1)` is empty. **Safe**.\n\nStrategic Choice:\n*   **UP**: Death.\n*   **DOWN**: Safe. Moves towards `(8, 0)`. Cornering myself? `(8, 0)` is safe but then I'm at the bottom wall.\n*   **LEFT**: Safe. Moves towards `(7, 2)`.\n*   **RIGHT**: Safe. Moves to `(9, 2)`.\n\nI need to pursue apples. The closest apples are in the bottom-left quadrant: `(3, 1), (2, 1), (5, 2), (6, 1)`.\n*   My current x is 8. I need to go left (decrease x) to reach these apples.\n*   **LEFT** moves me towards `(7, 2)` which is a good step towards `(5, 2)` or `(3, 1)`.\n*   **DOWN** moves me to `(8, 1)`. This is closer to `(6, 1)` (which is at x=6, y=1). From `(8, 1)`, I can then go left to `(7, 1)`, `(6, 1)`. This seems like a very safe path along the bottom edge.\n*   **RIGHT** leads to `(9, 2)`, which is a dead end against the wall.\n\nComparing **LEFT** and **DOWN**:\n*   **DOWN** to `(8, 1)` gets me closer to the apple at `(6, 1)`. It also avoids the vertical column above my head where my body is.\n*   **LEFT** to `(7, 2)` gets me closer to `(5, 2)` or `(3, 1)`. However, `(7, 2)` is adjacent to my body at `(8, 3)`? No, `(8, 3)` is vertical. `(7, 2)` is safe.\n\nLet's look at the board again for row 1 and 2.\nRow 2: `(0,2)` to `(9,2)`. `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `A` `.` `.` `0` `.`.\nRow 1: `(0,1)` to `(9,1)`. `.` `.` `A` `A` `.` `.` `A` `.` `.` `.`.\n\nMy head is at `(8, 2)`.\nIf I go **DOWN** to `(8, 1)`:\n- This cell is empty on the board.\n- From there, I can go **LEFT** to `(7, 1)` -> `(6, 1)` to eat the apple.\n- This path is very clear.\n\nIf I go **LEFT** to `(7, 2)`:\n- This cell is empty.\n- From there, I can go **LEFT** to `(6, 2)` -> `(5, 2)` to eat the apple.\n- This path is also clear.\n\nBoth paths are valid. However, moving **DOWN** to `(8, 1)` places my head on the bottom edge (y=1), which is safer than being at y=2 in terms of limiting directions for enemies? No, that doesn't matter much.\nThe key is getting to an apple. `(6, 1)` is at x=6, y=1. `(5, 2)` is at x=5, y=2.\nDistance from `(8, 2)`:\nTo `(6, 1)`: Manhattan distance = |8-6| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3.\nTo `(5, 2)`: Manhattan distance = |8-5| + |2-2| = 3.\nThey are equidistant.\n\nHowever, looking at the board:\n`(8, 2)` is adjacent to `(8, 3)` (my body).\n`(7, 2)` is open.\n`(8, 1)` is open.\n\nLet's check the enemy snake. Head at `(5, 4)`. It is moving. It likely wants apples near it, like `(5, 2)` or `(2, 1)` or `(3, 1)`.\nIf I go for `(5, 2)`, I might race the enemy.\nIf I go for `(6, 1)`, I am slightly closer to the right side, but the apple is at x=6.\n\nLet's consider the \"multi-apple\" aspect. I have 7 apples, Snake 1 has 11. I need to catch up.\nThe apples are clustered in the bottom left. Moving **LEFT** takes me directly into the cluster. Moving **DOWN** moves me parallel to the cluster but slightly towards it.\n\nActually, looking at the board grid provided in the prompt:\nRow 2: `(8,2)` is `0` (My head).\nRow 1: `(8,1)` is `.` (Empty).\nRow 0: `(8,0)` is `.`.\n\nLet's consider the move **LEFT** to `(7, 2)`.\nFrom `(7, 2)`, I have access to `(6, 2)` -> `(5, 2)` (Apple).\nAlso, if needed, I can go down to `(7, 1)`.\nThis keeps my head higher up, away from the very bottom row (y=0), which is a common trap location.\n\nLet's consider the move **DOWN** to `(8, 1)`.\nFrom `(8, 1)`, I go left to `(7, 1)` -> `(6, 1)` (Apple).\nThis moves me to the edge y=1. From there I could go to y=0, which is dangerous.\n\nActually, let's look at the apples again.\n`(6, 1)` is an apple. `(5, 2)` is an apple.\nIf I move **LEFT** to `(7, 2)`:\nDistance to `(5, 2)` is 2.\nDistance to `(6, 1)` is |7-6| + |2-1| = 2.\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to `(8, 1)`:\nDistance to `(6, 1)` is 2.\nDistance to `(5, 2)` is 3.\n\nSo **LEFT** is slightly better for getting an apple sooner (possibly next turn).\nAlso, **LEFT** keeps me at `y=2`. `y=2` is safer than `y=1` because `y=0` is a trap wall. By staying at `y=2`, I avoid the bottom row entirely for now.\n\nWhat about the enemy? Snake #1 is at `(5, 4)`.\nIf I go **LEFT** to `(7, 2)` and then go for `(5, 2)`, Snake #1 might try to intercept from `(5, 4)` or `(5, 5)`. Snake #1 is long.\nIf I go **DOWN** to `(8, 1)` and go for `(6, 1)`, Snake #1 is less likely to reach me there.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nEnemy body at `(5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6)...`\nSnake #1 is heading towards the left side of the board. It is far from me at x=8.\nThe apples at `(3,1), (2,1)` are in the far bottom left.\nThe apples at `(5,2), (6,1)` are closer to me.\nSnake #1 is at x=5, y=4. It is very close to `(5, 2)`.\nSnake #1's head is at `(5, 4)`. It can easily go DOWN to `(5, 3)` then `(5, 2)`.\nI am at `(8, 2)`. If I go **LEFT** to `(7, 2)`, I am 2 steps away from `(5, 2)`.\nSnake #1 is 2 steps away from `(5, 2)`.\nThis is a race for `(5, 2)` which I might lose because Snake #1 might be hungry and moving towards it.\nHowever, Snake #1 is very long (11 apples). It might be playing it safe.\n\nIf I go **DOWN** to `(8, 1)`:\nI am 2 steps away from `(6, 1)`.\nSnake #1 is at `(5, 4)`. Distance to `(6, 1)` is |5-6| + |4-1| = 4. I am much closer to `(6, 1)` than Snake #1 is.\nSo `(6, 1)` is a safer apple to target.\nTherefore, **DOWN** to `(8, 1)` is the strategic move to secure an apple without as much competition.\n\nAlso, check safety of **DOWN**:\nTarget `(8, 1)`. Is it safe from collisions?\nMy body: `(8, 3), (8, 4)...` and `(9, 5)...`. `(8, 1)` is not in my body.\nBoard: `(8, 1)` is `.`.\nSo **DOWN** is safe.\n\nIs there any risk of Snake #1 moving to intercept me?\nSnake #1 is at `(5, 4)`. It cannot reach `(8, 1)` this turn.\nHowever, if I move **DOWN** to `(8, 1)`, I will be on row 1.\nFrom `(8, 1)`, I can move to `(6, 1)` next turn.\nSnake #1 might move to `(5, 3)` or `(5, 2)`.\nIf Snake #1 moves to `(5, 2)`, it eats the apple there.\nThat leaves me `(6, 1)` and `(3, 1)`, `(2, 1)`.\nThis is a good plan.\n\nWait, check the board for `(8, 1)` again.\nRow 1: `. . A A . . A . . .`\nx=0: ., x=1: ., x=2: A, x=3: A, x=4: ., x=5: ., x=6: A, x=7: ., x=8: ., x=9: .\nSo `(8, 1)` is empty.\nCheck `(8, 0)` just in case I get stuck.\nRow 0: `. . . . . . . . . .`\nAll empty.\n\nCheck `LEFT` to `(7, 2)`:\nRow 2: `. . . . . A . . 0 .`\nx=7: `.`\nSo `(7, 2)` is empty.\n\nCheck `RIGHT` to `(9, 2)`:\nx=9: `.`\nEmpty.\n\nCheck `UP` to `(8, 3)`:\nThis is my body. `(8, 3)` is the first segment.\nSo `UP` is death.\n\nSo I eliminate UP.\nI consider LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT.\nRIGHT is bad (corner).\nSo LEFT vs DOWN.\nI want to go for the apple at `(6, 1)` which is safer.\nTherefore, **DOWN**.\n\nWait, let me re-read the prompt carefully.\n\"My snake (ID: 0): Head: (8, 2)\"\nWait. The prompt says: \"Turn: 39 / 150\"\nAnd \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (8, 2)\"\nThis is the state *before* I make the move for Turn 39?\nOr is this the state *after* I made the move for Turn 38?\n\"Turn: 39\" usually implies \"It is now Turn 39, make a move\".\nIf my head is `(8, 2)`, then I *did* move to `(8, 2)` on Turn 38.\nThe \"Last move information\" confirms I picked DOWN on Turn 38.\n\"My last move information: ... DOWN ... My head is at `(8, 3)`.\"\nSo on Turn 38, I was at `(8, 3)`. I moved DOWN to `(8, 2)`.\nSo for Turn 39, my head IS at `(8, 2)`.\nThe board state provided is a bit ambiguous. It shows `0` at `(8, 2)` in the grid.\n` 2 . . . . . A . . 0 .`\nYes, the `0` is at x=8, y=2.\nThe apples listed include `(6, 1)`.\nSo the state is: Head at `(8, 2)`. Apple at `(6, 1)`.\nMy reasoning above holds.\n\nWait, look at the \"My snake (ID: 0)\" section again.\n\"Body: [(8, 3), (8, 4), ...]\"\nThis body list is likely the body *excluding* the head, or the body *including* the head?\n\"Body: [(8, 3), (8, 4), ...]\"\nHead is `(8, 2)`.\nSo the body segments are at `(8, 3), (8, 4), ...`\nThis means my body occupies `(8, 3)`. So `UP` is blocked.\nAnd the tail is `(9, 8)` (last item in the list provided).\nSince I ate an apple on the previous turn (Turn 38), the tail `(9, 8)` did NOT move.\nSo my body for Turn 39 is:\nHead: `(8, 2)`\nBody: `(8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)`\nTail: `(9, 8)` (Wait, usually the tail is the last element of the list).\nThe prompt says: \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail... and the last tuple is the tail.\"\nProvided list: `[(8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)]`\nSo the tail is `(9, 8)`.\nSince I ate, the tail stays at `(9, 8)`.\nSo the occupied cells are: `(8, 2)` (Head), `(8, 3)...(9, 8)`.\n\nSo:\n- UP to `(8, 3)`: Occupied by body. **DEAD**.\n- LEFT to `(7, 2)`: Check board. `.`. Check if it is in my body. No. **SAFE**.\n- RIGHT to `(9, 2)`: Check board. `.`. Not in body. **SAFE**.\n- DOWN to `(8, 1)`: Check board. `.`. Not in body. **SAFE**.\n\nStrategic choice: Go for apple at `(6, 1)`.\nPath: `(8, 2)` -> `(8, 1)` -> `(7, 1)` -> `(6, 1)`.\nThis requires moving DOWN first.\nAlternative path for `(6, 1)`: `(8, 2)` -> `(7, 2)` -> `(7, 1)` -> `(6, 1)`.\nThis requires moving LEFT first.\nManhattan distance is the same.\nHowever, moving DOWN to `(8, 1)` puts me on the line y=1.\nFrom `(8, 1)`, I am 1 step away from the wall at y=0.\nFrom `(8, 2)`, moving LEFT to `(7, 2)` keeps me at y=2.\nIs there any danger in being at y=1?\n`(8, 1)` is safe. `(8, 0)` is safe.\nBut I want to avoid getting trapped.\nActually, the apple at `(6, 1)` is on y=1.\nTo reach it, I will have to traverse y=1 eventually.\nSo going to `(8, 1)` is just the first step towards that.\n\nIs there any other apple I should consider?\nApples: `(3, 1), (5, 2), (6, 7), (2, 1), (6, 1)`.\n`(6, 7)` is very far up. I am at `(8, 2)`. Manhattan distance 9.\n`(5, 2)` is close.\n`(6, 1)` is close.\n`(3, 1), (2, 1)` are further.\n\nLet's consider the enemy.\nSnake #1: Head `(5, 4)`. Body `[(5, 5), (4, 5), ...]`.\nSnake #1 is positioned to go for `(5, 2)` easily.\nIf I go for `(5, 2)`, it's a race.\nIf I go for `(6, 1)`, I am alone.\nAlso, note that Snake #1 has 11 apples. I have 7.\nI need to score.\nThe safe bet is to secure the apple I can get without fighting.\nTherefore, move towards `(6, 1)`.\nMoving **DOWN** is the first step.\n\nIs there any possibility that `DOWN` is blocked by an enemy?\nSnake #1 is at `(5, 4)`. It cannot reach `(8, 1)` this turn.\nSo `DOWN` is safe.\n\nLet's double check if I am trapped.\nIf I move DOWN to `(8, 1)`:\nNext turn I can move DOWN to `(8, 0)`, LEFT to `(7, 1)`, or RIGHT to `(9, 1)`.\nI won't be trapped immediately.\nIf I move LEFT to `(7, 2)`:\nNext turn I can move UP to `(7, 3)`, DOWN to `(7, 1)`, LEFT to `(6, 2)`, or RIGHT to `(8, 2)`.\nAlso safe.\n\nSo both are safe.\nWhy prefer DOWN?\nBecause it aligns me with the apple at `(6, 1)` and `(6, 1)` is not claimed by the enemy (who is at x=5).\nAlso, `DOWN` moves me to the bottom row, which is usually quiet.\nAlso, check if `(8, 1)` is adjacent to any enemy parts.\nNo.\n\nDecision: **DOWN**.\n\nWait, I should check one more thing.\nThe prompt says: \"My head is at (8, 2)\".\nWait, in the \"Your snake (ID: 0)\" section, it says \"Head: (8, 2)\".\nBut in the \"Last move information\", it says \"The board state shows my head at (8, 3)\".\nThis implies the \"Last move information\" describes the state *before* the last move (Turn 38).\nAnd the \"Your snake (ID: 0)\" section describes the state *after* the last move (Start of Turn 39).\nSo yes, Head is at `(8, 2)`.\n\nFinal check on direction:\n**UP**: `(8, 3)`. My body. **NO**.\n**DOWN**: `(8, 1)`. Empty. **YES**.\n**LEFT**: `(7, 2)`. Empty. **YES**.\n**RIGHT**: `(9, 2)`. Empty. **YES**.\n\nTarget: Apple at `(6, 1)`.\nPath: `(8, 2) -> (8, 1) -> (7, 1) -> (6, 1)`.\nThis path is clear.\nPath: `(8, 2) -> (7, 2) -> (6, 2) -> (5, 2)`. This leads to an apple at `(5, 2)` but also very close to Enemy Head at `(5, 4)`.\nI should avoid the enemy if possible.\nSo I prefer the path to `(6, 1)`.\nFirst move to `(6, 1)` is **DOWN**.\n\nIs there any reason to stay at `y=2`?\n`(5, 2)` is an apple.\n`(6, 7)` is an apple.\n`(3, 1)` is an apple.\nIf I go **DOWN** to `(8, 1)`, I can still pivot to go for `(3, 1)` later if I clear `(6, 1)`.\nIf I go **LEFT** to `(7, 2)`, I am close to `(5, 2)` and `(3, 1)`.\nBut I am also close to the enemy.\nI will stick with **DOWN**. It feels safer.\n\nPlan for next turn:\n- Move DOWN to (8, 1).\n- Eat apple at (6, 1) in 2 turns.\n- Avoid Snake #1.\n\nOne final check.\nWhat if Snake #1 moves DOWN to (5, 3) and then to (5, 2)?\nThen I eat (6, 1).\nIf Snake #1 moves DOWN to (5, 3) and then to (5, 2), does it block me?\nSnake #1 is long. Its body is at (5, 5)... It won't block my path to (6, 1).\nI am safe.\n\nDecision: DOWN.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thoughts\": \"My head is at (8, 2). I ate an apple on the last turn so I grew.

This implies the previous tail position `(8, 6)` moved to `(8, 5)`, and so on.\n    *   Last Turn (Turn 40): Head `(8, 1)`. Tail was at `(8, 6)`.\n    *   Current Turn (Turn 41): Head `(8, 0)`. Tail has moved to `(8, 5)`.\n    *   Therefore, the cell `(8, 1)` is currently occupied by my body segment that was at `(8, 2)` last turn.\n    *   Similarly, `(8, 2)` is occupied by the segment that was at `(8, 3)`.\n    *   The gap created by the previous head moving from `(8, 1)` to `(8, 0)` has been filled by the subsequent body segment.\n\n**Move Safety Check (Immediate Death Prevention):**\n1.  **UP (to (8, 1)):**\n    *   The snake moves UP.\n    *   The body segment currently at `(8, 1)` moves to `(8, 0)` (following the head).\n    *   If I move UP to `(8, 1)`, I collide with my own body segment moving there.\n    *   **Result:** DEATH. (Also counts as moving backward into the body).\n\n2.  **LEFT (to (7, 0)):**\n    *   Target coordinates: `(7, 0)`.\n    *   Is it within bounds? Yes (0-9).\n    *   Is it occupied by my body?\n        *   My current body (without head) is `[(8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6)]`.\n        *   `(7, 0)` is not in this list.\n        *   Will `(7, 0)` be occupied by my body moving? No, my body is at x=8 or x=9.\n        *   Will the empty space behind my head `(8, 0)` become occupied? No.\n    *   Is it occupied by Enemy #1?\n        *   Enemy #1 Body: `[(5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7)]`. `(7, 0)` is safe.\n    *   **Result:** SAFE.\n\n3.  **RIGHT (to (9, 0)):**\n    *   Target coordinates: `(9, 0)`.\n    *   Is it within bounds? Yes.\n    *   Is it occupied by my body?\n        *   Current body does not contain `(9, 0)`. `(9, 5)` and `(9, 6)` are occupied, but `(9, 0)` is far away.\n    *   Is it occupied by Enemy #1? No.\n    *   **Result:** SAFE.\n\n4.  **DOWN (to (8, -1)):**\n    *   Target coordinates: `(8, -1)`.\n    *   Is it within bounds? No. Y cannot be -1.\n    *   **Result:** DEATH.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nBetween **LEFT** and **RIGHT**, both are safe.\n*   **RIGHT (to 9,0):** Moves me into the corner. While safe now, it forces me to move LEFT next turn (only option). This is a \"dead end\" strategy and reduces maneuverability.\n*   **LEFT (to 7,0):** Moves me away from the corner. This preserves my option to move LEFT, DOWN (if 7,-1 is valid and safe next turn), or potentially turn UP later. It is strictly better for maintaining open paths.\n\n**Conclusion:** The only viable, non-suicidal, and strategically sound move is **LEFT**.\n\nLEFT",

This move brings me closest to multiple apples and gives me the most options for the next turn. After moving to (3,2), I will be positioned to potentially reach either (3,1) directly below me, or (2,1) and (2,4) which are both close by. This is the most promising position for apple collection compared to UP or DOWN, which only bring me close to one apple. Moving left also keeps me away from the right edge where the enemy snake is positioned, and avoids moving further down where my body is concentrated.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter moving to (3,2), I should prioritize collecting the apple at (3,1) directly below me if it remains available, as it's the closest apple. The apples at (2,1) and (2,4) are also within easy reach from this position. I need to be aware of the enemy snake at (7,0) which is moving on the right side of the board, and avoid head-on collisions. With the score at 12-7 in my favor, I should continue to be aggressive in collecting apples while maintaining awareness of the enemy's position. The left side of the board has multiple apples clustered together, so I should focus on that area while keeping an eye on (6,1) and (6,7) as alternative targets. I should avoid the left edge where my body is concentrated, and instead work toward the center and right side of the board where more apples are located. I need to be careful not to get trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends, and maintain multiple safe follow-up moves.\n\nLEFT",

It will be occupied by my body.\n        \n        If I go UP to `(7, 1)`:\n        Next turn, I can go UP to `(7, 2)`.\n        Or I can go LEFT to `(6, 1)`.\n        \n        If I go LEFT to `(6, 0)`:\n        Next turn, I can go UP to `(6, 1)`.\n        Or I can go LEFT to `(5, 0)`.\n        \n        The apples at `(6, 1)` and `(6, 2)` are reachable from both.\n        \n        Let's check if `(6, 1)` is dangerous.\n        If I go UP to `(7, 1)` and then LEFT to `(6, 1)`:\n        Enemy is at `(4, 2)`.\n        If enemy moves to `(5, 2)`, it's on the other side of the `.` at `(5, 1)`.\n        If enemy moves to `(5, 2)` and I am at `(6, 1)`, I am safe.\n        \n        Let's check the apple at `(6, 7)`.\n        From `(7, 1)`: `(7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7)`.

But `(8, 1)` will be my body.\n        So `(7, 1)` is not a dead end.\n        \n        Let's reconsider the `LEFT` move to `(6, 0)`.\n        Is there a reason to avoid it?\n        `(6, 0)` is at the bottom edge.\n        `(7, 1)` is not.\n        \n        Let's look at `(5, 0)`.\n        It is empty.\n        \n        Let's look at `(6, 1)`.\n        It is an apple.\n        \n        Let's look at `(7, 1)`.\n        It is empty.\n        \n        Let's look at `(8, 1)`.\n        It is my body.\n        \n        If I go UP to `(7, 1)`, I am at `(7, 1)`.\n        If I go LEFT to `(6, 0)`, I am at `(6, 0)`.\n        \n        The enemy is at `(4, 2)`.\n        The enemy body is at `(5, 2), (5, 3)...`.\n        If I go UP to `(7, 1)`, I am separated from the enemy by `(6, 1), (5, 1)`.\n        If I go LEFT to `(6, 0)`, I am separated by `(5, 0)`.\n        \n        Let's assume the enemy moves.\n        If I go UP, I am at `(7, 1)`.\n        If enemy moves to `(5, 2)` or similar, it's far.\n        \n        If I go LEFT, I am at `(6, 0)`.\n        If enemy moves to `(5, 2)`, it's still far.\n        \n        Let's look at the `A` at `(3, 1)`.\n        To get there, I need to go `(4, 1)`, `(3, 1)`.\n        From `(7, 1)`, I pass through `(6, 1)`, `(5, 1)`.\n        From `(6, 0)`, I pass through `(5, 0)`, `(4, 0)`, `(3, 0)`, `(3, 1)`.\n        \n        The path `(5, 1)` is currently empty.\n        The path `(5, 0)` is currently empty.\n        \n        Let's check `(4, 1)`.\n        It is empty.\n        \n        Is there a wall?\n        No.\n        \n        Let's check `(6, 0)` vs `(7, 1)` again.\n        `(7, 1)` allows a UP move to `(7, 2)`.\n        `(6, 0)` does not allow a DOWN move.\n        \n        The ability to move UP is more valuable than the ability to move DOWN (which is often blocked by walls or body).\n        However, moving UP from `(7, 1)` means I am moving away from the apples at `(3, 1)` and `(2, 1)` which are at y=1 and y=4.\n        Wait, `(2, 4)` is also an apple.\n        Row 4: `. . A . . T . .

Body: `(7, 1), (7, 0)...`.\n        If I eat `(6, 1)` from `(6, 0)`, I am at `(6, 1)`. Body: `(6, 0), (7, 0)...`.\n        \n        The body configuration is similar.\n        \n        Let's look at the `T` at `(5, 2)`.\n        It blocks the LEFT move from `(6, 2)`.\n        \n        If I am at `(7, 2)`, I can go LEFT to `(6, 2)`.\n        If I am at `(7, 1)`, I can go LEFT to `(6, 1)`.\n        \n        Is there a reason to avoid `(6, 1)`?\n        If I am at `(6, 1)`, I can go UP to `(6, 2)`.\n        If I am at `(6, 2)`, I cannot go LEFT.\n        But I can go UP or RIGHT.\n        \n        So `(6, 1)` and `(6, 2)` are safe.\n        \n        Why did the previous rationale mention `(7, 1)`?\n        It didn't. It only considered `(7, 0)` vs `(9, 0)`.\n        \n        I need to decide between `UP` and `LEFT`.\n        `UP` leads to `(7, 1)`.\n        `LEFT` leads to `(6, 0)`.\n        \n        Let's check `(7, 1)` again.\n        It is empty.\n        \n        Let's check `(6, 0)` again.\n        It is empty.\n        \n        Is there a head-on collision risk?\n        I am at `(7, 0)`.\n        Enemy is at `(4, 2)`.\n        \n        If I move UP, head `(7, 1)`.\n        If Enemy moves UP, head `(4, 3)`.\n        No collision.\n        \n        If I move LEFT, head `(6, 0)`.\n        If Enemy moves UP, head `(4, 3)`.\n        No collision.\n        \n        Wait, look at the apple at `(6, 1)`.\n        If I go LEFT to `(6, 0)`, I am next to the apple.\n        If I go UP to `(7, 1)`, I am next to the apple at `(6, 1)`.\n        \n        Is there an apple at `(7, 1)`?

No.\n        \n        The closest apples are at `(6, 1)` and `(6, 2)`.\n        Both `UP` and `LEFT` lead to them.\n        \n        Is there a reason to prefer `LEFT`?\n        `(6, 0)` is closer to `(3, 1)` and `(2, 1)`.\n        \n        Is there a reason to prefer `UP`?\n        `(7, 1)` is closer to `(7, 7)`.\n        `(7, 1)` avoids the `T` at `(5, 2)` in the sense that if I eat `(6, 2)` and then `(6, 3)`, I am safe.\n        \n        Let's check the `T` at `(8, 1)` etc.\n        That is my own body.\n        \n        Let's check the `T` at `(5, 2)`.\n        That is enemy body.\n        \n        If I go LEFT to `(6, 0)`, then UP to `(6, 1)`, then UP to `(6, 2)`.\n        I am at `(6, 2)`.\n        My body is `(6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0) ...`.\n        The enemy body is at `(5, 2)`.\n        Distance between my head and enemy body is 1.\n        If I go UP to `(6, 3)`, distance increases.\n        If I go RIGHT to `(7, 2)`, distance increases.\n        \n        It is safe.\n        \n        But `UP` to `(7, 1)` puts me at `(7, 1)`.\n        My body is `(7, 0), (8, 1)...`.\n        If I go LEFT to `(6, 1)`, I am at `(6, 1)`.\n        If I go UP to `(7, 2)`, I am at `(7, 2)`.\n        \n        From `(7, 2)`, I can go LEFT to `(6, 2)`.\n        From `(6, 2)`, I am near `(5, 2)`.\n        \n        So `UP` allows me to stay away from `(5, 2)` longer if I want to go to `(7, 7)`.\n        \n        Which path is more flexible?\n        `UP` path: `(7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3)...`\n        `LEFT` path: `(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)...`\n        \n        The `UP` path seems to offer more open space to the right (x=8, x=9) if needed (though my body is there).\n        Wait, my body is at x=8.\n        So `(8, 1)` is body.\n        `(8, 2)` is body.\n        So I cannot go RIGHT to `(8, 1)` or `(8, 2)`.\n        \n        So from `(7, 1)`, I can go UP or LEFT.\n        From `(7, 2)`, I can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (to `(8, 2)` - body).\n        From `(6, 1)`, I can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n        From `(6, 2)`, I can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT (but LEFT is death).\n        \n        So `LEFT` is slightly more constrained at `(6, 2)`.\n        \n        Let's go with `UP` to `(7, 1)`.\n        \n        Wait, is `(7, 1)` an apple?

Row 0: `(9, 0)` is `T`.\nRow 1: `(9, 1)` is `T`.\n...\nRow 5: `(9, 5)` is `T`.\nSo `x=9` is blocked by my body.\nIf I go UP to `(7, 1)`, I am at `x=7`.\nIf I go LEFT to `(6, 0)`, I am at `x=6`.\nBoth are safe from `x=9`.\n\nIs there any other constraint?\nEnemy #1 is at `(4, 2)`.\nEnemy body is at `(5, 2)` to `(0, 8)`.\nThe gap between my head and enemy is large.\n\nThe apples are at `(6, 1)` and `(6, 2)`.\nTo get there:\nIf I go UP to `(7, 1)`, then LEFT to `(6, 1)`, then UP to `(6, 2)`.\nIf I go LEFT to `(6, 0)`, then UP to `(6, 1)`, then UP to `(6, 2)`.\nBoth paths take the same number of turns.\nThe resulting position after eating `(6, 2)`:\nPath 1: Head at `(6, 2)`. Body: `(6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), ...`\nPath 2: Head at `(6, 2)`. Body: `(6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), ...`\n\nIn Path 1, the body is at `(7, 1)`.\nIn Path 2, the body is at `(6, 0)`.\nIf I am at `(6, 2)` and want to go LEFT, I die because of the enemy at `(5, 2)`.\nSo I must go UP or RIGHT.\nPath 1 (Body at `(7, 1)`): `(6, 2)` neighbors are `(6, 1)` (Body), `(6, 3)` (Empty), `(5, 2)` (Enemy Body), `(7, 2)` (Empty).\nPath 2 (Body at `(6, 0)`): `(6, 2)` neighbors are `(6, 1)` (Body), `(6, 3)` (Empty), `(5, 2)` (Enemy Body), `(7, 2)` (Empty).\n\nThey are the same.\nBut Path 1 started at `(7, 1)`. Path 2 started at `(6, 0)`.\n`(7, 1)` is slightly more open.\n\nFinal check: `(6, 1)` is an apple.\nIf I am at `(7, 0)` and go UP to `(7, 1)`, I can go LEFT to `(6, 1)` next turn.\nThe body will follow.\nThis is safe.\n\nI will choose UP.\n\nWait, check `(5, 0)` just in case.\nIf I go LEFT to `(6, 0)`, I can go LEFT to `(5, 0)`.\n`(5, 0)` is `.`.\nIf I go UP to `(7, 1)`, I can go UP to `(7, 2)`.\n`(7, 2)` is `.`.\nBoth are safe.\nI prefer UP.\n\nWait, look at the board again.\nRow 0: `. . . . . . . 0 T .`\nI am at 7.\nI can go UP.\nI can go LEFT.\nI cannot go RIGHT (Body).\nI cannot go DOWN (Wall).\n\nIs `(7, 1)` strictly safer than `(6, 0)`?\n`(7, 1)` has `(6, 1)` as a neighbor (Apple).\n`(6, 0)` has `(6, 1)` as a neighbor (Apple).\n`(7, 1)` has `(7, 2)` as a neighbor (Open).\n`(6, 0)` has `(5, 0)` as a neighbor (Open).\n`(7, 1)` has `(8, 1)` as a neighbor (Body).\n`(6, 0)` has `(7, 0)` as a neighbor (Body).\n\n`(7, 1)` allows a UP move to `(7, 2)`.\n`(6, 0)` allows a LEFT move to `(5, 0)`.\n`(6, 0)` does NOT allow a DOWN move.\n`(7, 1)` does NOT allow a DOWN move (Body).\nSo the \"down\" option is equivalent (blocked).\nThe \"up\" option: `(7, 1)` has `(7, 2)`. `(6, 0)` has `(6, 1)` (Apple).\nThe \"left\" option: `(7, 1)` has `(6, 1)` (Apple). `(6, 0)` has `(5, 0)`.\nThe \"right\" option: `(7, 1)` has `(8, 1)` (Body). `(6, 0)` has `(7, 0)` (Body).\n\n`(6, 1)` is an apple.\nSo `LEFT` from `(7, 1)` gives an apple.\n`UP` from `(6, 0)` gives an apple.\nBoth moves lead to apples next turn.\nBut `UP` from `(7, 1)` goes to `(7, 2)`, which is open.\n`LEFT` from `(6, 0)` goes to `(5, 0)`, which is open.\nWait, `(6, 1)` is an apple.\nIf I go UP to `(7, 1)`, I can immediately go LEFT to `(6, 1)` (Apple).\nIf I go LEFT to `(6, 0)`, I can immediately go UP to `(6, 1)` (Apple).\nSo both next moves result in eating an apple.\nWait, if I eat an apple, my body grows. The tail does not move.\nThis affects the safety of the following turn.\n\nIf I am at `(6, 1)` (Apple):\nCase A (Started UP): Head `(6, 1)`. Body `(7, 1), (7, 0), (8, 1)...`\nCase B (Started LEFT): Head `(6, 1)`. Body `(6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 1)...`\n\nIn Case A, `(7, 1)` is body.\nIn Case B, `(6, 0)` is body.\nIf I want to go LEFT from `(6, 1)`:\nCase A: `(5, 1)` is `.`. Safe.\nCase B: `(5, 1)` is `.`. Safe.\nIf I want to go UP from `(6, 1)`:\nCase A: `(6, 2)` is `A`. Safe.\nCase B: `(6, 2)` is `A`. Safe.\nIf I want to go RIGHT from `(6, 1)`:\nCase A: `(7, 1)` is Body. Unsafe.\nCase B: `(7, 1)` is `.`. Safe.\nSo, if I start with `LEFT` (going to `(6, 0)` then `(6, 1)`), I have a RIGHT option from `(6, 1)` which is `.`.\nIf I start with `UP` (going to `(7, 1)` then `(6, 1)`), I do NOT have a RIGHT option from `(6, 1)` because `(7, 1)` is my body.\nSo, the `LEFT` start gives me one more escape route (RIGHT) at `(6, 1)`.\n\nHowever, I can also go UP from `(6, 1)` to `(6, 2)` (Apple) in both cases.\nAnd `(6, 2)` will be safe.\nFrom `(6, 2)`, I can go UP to `(6, 3)` or RIGHT to `(7, 2)`.\n\nSo the `LEFT` start is slightly more flexible.\nLet's compare `(7, 1)` vs `(6, 0)` again.\nFrom `(7, 1)`, I can go UP to `(7, 2)`.\nFrom `(6, 0)`, I can go LEFT to `(5, 0)`.\nIf I go UP to `(7, 2)`, I am at `(7, 2)`. Body: `(7, 1), (7, 0)...`\nFrom `(6, 0)`, if I go UP to `(6, 1)` (Apple), I am at `(6, 1)`.\nIf I eat the apple, body grows.\nIf I don't eat (wait, I do eat).\nOkay, so if I go `(6, 0) -> (6, 1)`, I eat apple.\nIf I go `(7, 1) -> (6, 1)`, I eat apple.\nThe resulting state at `(6, 1)` is different regarding where my body is.\nIn the `LEFT` path, `(6, 0)` is body.\nIn the `UP` path, `(7, 1)` is body.\nThe `LEFT` path seems better because it leaves `(7, 1)` open.\n\nWait, if I go `LEFT` to `(6, 0)`, then `UP` to `(6, 1)` (Apple):\nMy body: `(6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 1)...`\nIf I then go `RIGHT` to `(7, 1)`:\n`(7, 1)` is `.`.\nThis is safe.\nIf I go `UP` to `(6, 2)` (Apple):\n`(6, 2)` is `A`.\nIf I go `LEFT` to `(5, 1)`:\n`(5, 1)` is `.`.\n\nIf I go `UP` to `(7, 1)`, then `LEFT` to `(6, 1)` (Apple):\nMy body: `(7, 1), (7, 0), (8, 1)...`\nIf I then go `RIGHT` to `(7, 1)`:\n`Body`. Crash.\nIf I go `UP` to `(6, 2)` (Apple):\n`(6, 2)` is `A`.\nIf I go `LEFT` to `(5, 1)`:\n`(5, 1)` is `.`.\n\nSo starting with `LEFT` allows me to return to `(7, 1)` if needed.\nStarting with `UP` makes `(7, 1)` a wall (my body).\nDoes `LEFT` to `(6, 0)` have any downside?\n`(6, 0)` is at the bottom wall.\n`(7, 1)` is not.\nHowever, `(6, 0)` has an escape route `LEFT` to `(5, 0)`.\n`(7, 1)` has an escape route `UP` to `(7, 2)`.\nBoth are good.\n\nIs `(6, 0)` safe from immediate collision?\nYes.\nIs `(7, 1)` safe? Yes.\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\n`(6, 1)` is an apple.\nTo get there:\nFrom `(7, 0)`: `LEFT` to `(6, 0)`, then `UP` to `(6, 1)`.\nOr `UP` to `(7, 1)`, then `LEFT` to `(6, 1)`.\nIn both cases, I eat the apple.\nIn the `LEFT` path, the body is `(6, 0), (7, 0) ...`.\nIn the `UP` path, the body is `(7, 1), (7, 0) ...`.\nThe `LEFT` path seems slightly better because `(6, 0)` is further from the `T` at `(5, 2)` than `(7, 1)` is? No.\n`(6, 0)` is at y=0. `(7, 1)` is at y=1.\n`(5, 2)` is at y=2.\nDistance from `(6, 0)` to `(5, 2)` is 2 steps (diagonal). Manhattan is 3.\nDistance from `(7, 1)` to `(5, 2)` is 1 step (horizontal). Manhattan is 2.\nWait, `(7, 1)` is closer to `(5, 2)` than `(6, 0)` is?\nNo, `(7, 1)` is at x=7, y=1. `(5, 2)` is at x=5, y=2. Difference: 2, 1.\n`(6, 0)` is at x=6, y=0. `(5, 2)` is at x=5, y=2. Difference: 1, 2.\nManhattan distance is 3 for both.\nSo distance is equal.\n\nLet's look at the gap at `(4, 1)`.\n`(4, 1)` is `.`.\nIf I am at `(6, 0)`, I can go `(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1)` (Apple).\nIf I am at `(7, 1)`, I can go `(6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1)` (Apple).\nBoth are clear paths.\n\nWait, look at `(6, 0)` again.\nIf I am at `(6, 0)`, I am surrounded by `(6, 1)` (Apple), `(5, 0)` (Empty), `(7, 0)` (Body).\nIf I am at `(7, 1)`, I am surrounded by `(6, 1)` (Apple), `(7, 2)` (Empty), `(8, 1)` (Body).\nThey are symmetric.\n\nIs there a reason to avoid `(6, 0)`?\nIt's on the bottom row.\nBut I have `LEFT` and `UP` options.\nI don't have `DOWN`.\nAt `(7, 1)`, I have `LEFT`, `UP`, `DOWN` (Body).\nSo `(7, 1)` has an extra direction that is blocked by body.\n`(6, 0)` has an extra direction blocked by wall.\nGenerally, body is more temporary than wall.\nBut here, `(7, 0)` will be body forever (until I eat apples and it shifts).\nActually, if I eat an apple at `(6, 1)`, the tail at `(9, 5)` stays.\nSo `(7, 0)` remains body.\nSo `DOWN` from `(7, 1)` is blocked for a while.\n\nLet's check the enemy again.\nHead `(4, 2)`.\nIf I go `LEFT` to `(6, 0)`, I am going towards the apples at `(2, 1)` and `(3, 1)`.\nIf I go `UP` to `(7, 1)`, I am going towards `(7, 7)`.\nThe apples at `(3, 1)` and `(2, 1)` are closer in Manhattan distance than `(7, 7)`.\n`(3, 1)` is `4` steps away from `(7, 0)`.\n`(7, 7)` is `7` steps away.\n`(6, 1)` is `2` steps away.\n`(6, 2)` is `3` steps away.\n\nThe apples at `(3, 1)` and `(2, 1)` are high density.\n`(6, 1)` and `(6, 2)` are also high density.\n`(2, 4)` is also an apple.\n\nI am at `(7, 0)`.\nThe enemy is at `(4, 2)`.\nIf I go `LEFT` to `(6, 0)`, I am closer to `(3, 1)`.\nIf I go `UP` to `(7, 1)`, I am further.\n\nLet's look at the `T` at `(5, 2)`.\nThis is the enemy body.\nIf I go `LEFT`, I am moving closer to it.\nBut I can just eat apples and leave.\n\nLet's look at the `T` at `(8, 1)`..`(8, 5)`.\nThat is my body.\nIf I go `UP`, I am moving towards `(7, 7)`.\nIf I go `LEFT`, I am moving towards `(2, 1)`.\nThe path to `(2, 1)` is open.\nThe path to `(7, 7)` is open.\n\nIs there a reason to avoid `LEFT`?\n`LEFT` puts me at `(6, 0)`.\nFrom there, `UP` to `(6, 1)` (Apple).\nFrom `(6, 1)`, `UP` to `(6, 2)` (Apple).\nFrom `(6, 2)`, `UP` to `(6, 3)` (Empty).\nFrom `(6, 3)`, `UP` to `(6, 4)` (Empty).\nFrom `(6, 4)`, `UP` to `(6, 5)` (Empty).\nFrom `(6, 5)`, `UP` to `(6, 6)` (Empty).\nFrom `(6, 6)`, `UP` to `(6, 7)` (Apple).\nThis is a very good line of apples.\nWait, check the board:\nRow 6: `. .

A . . .`\n`(6, 7)` is `A`.\nSo the vertical line at x=6 from y=0 to y=7 is mostly clear, except for the apples.\nThis is a fantastic path.\nIt leads to `(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 7)`.\nAnd it is a straight line.\nThis strongly suggests `LEFT` to `(6, 0)` is the best move.\nFrom `(6, 0)`, I can just go UP repeatedly.\nFrom `(7, 1)`, I would have to go LEFT to enter this line.\nIf I go `LEFT` now, I am immediately on the line.\nSo `LEFT` is the optimal move.\n\nDouble check safety of `(6, 0)`:\nIs it on board? Yes.\nIs it my body? No.\nIs it enemy body? No.\nIs it a wall? No.\nIs it safe from enemy head? Yes (enemy at `(4, 2)`).\nIs it safe from my future self? Yes, I can go UP.\n\nOne detail: `(5, 0)` is `.`.\nIf I go `LEFT` to `(6, 0)`, and then `UP` to `(6, 1)`.\nIf I want to go `LEFT` later, I can go `(5, 1)`.\nThe enemy body is at `(5, 2)`.\nIf I go to `(5, 1)`, I am safe.\nThe enemy body blocks `(5, 2)` but not `(5, 1)`.\nSo I can explore the left side safely.\n\nSo the plan is: `LEFT` to `(6, 0)`. Then `UP` to `(6, 1)`, `UP` to `(6, 2)`, etc.\nThis collects apples at `(6, 1)`, `(6, 2)`, `(6, 7)`.\nThen I can go `LEFT` to `(5, 7)` or similar and get `(2, 4)` and `(3, 1)`.\nThis seems like a very strong line.\n\nIf I go UP to `(7, 1)`, I can go LEFT to `(6, 1)`.\nThen I am on the same line.\nBut I am one step further away from `(6, 7)`.\nAnd one step further away from the `(2, 1)` cluster.\nSo `LEFT` is better.\n\nWait, if I am at `(6, 0)`, I am at `(6, 0)`.\nIf I go UP to `(6, 1)`, I eat apple.\nIf I go UP to `(6, 2)`, I eat apple.\nIf I go UP to `(6, 3)`, empty.\nIf I go UP to `(6, 4)`, empty.\nIf I go UP to `(6, 5)`, empty.\nIf I go UP to `(6, 6)`, empty.\nIf I go UP to `(6, 7)`, apple.\nThis is the \"Vein\".\nI must take this.\n\nSo the move is LEFT.\n\nWait, what if the enemy moves to `(5, 1)`?\nEnemy is at `(4, 2)`.\nIt can move DOWN to `(4, 1)`.\nIt can move DOWN-DOWN to `(4, 0)`.\nIt can move LEFT to `(3, 2)`.\nIt takes time to reach `(5, 1)`.\nI am safe.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves to `(6, 1)`?\nIt takes 2 turns to reach `(6, 1)` from `(4, 2)`.\nI can get there in 1 turn.\nI win the race.\nBut if I am at `(6, 0)` and enemy is at `(4, 2)`.\nIf I go `LEFT` to `(6, 0)`.\nIf enemy goes `LEFT` to `(3, 2)`.\nDistance is 3.\nIf I go `UP` to `(6, 1)`.\nIf enemy goes `LEFT` to `(2, 2)`.\nDistance is 4.\nWait, if I eat the apple, I grow. This might change things.\nBut generally, I am safe.\n\nThe \"Vein\" at x=6 is the best feature on the board for me.\nI should be at `(6, 0)` to enter it.\n\nFinal check: `(6, 0)` is safe.\n\nMy last move was LEFT to (7,0).\nSo I came from (8,0).\n(8,0) was the head before (7,0).\nSo (8,0) is now body.\n(8,1) is body.\n(8,2) is body.\n(9,5) is tail.\nMy body occupies the top right.\nI am at (7,0).\nGoing LEFT to (6,0) moves me towards the apples.\n\nSo, LEFT.\n\nOne last check on the \"backward\" rule.\nMy head is (7,0).\nPrevious head was (8,0).\nIf I go LEFT to (6,0), I am not going back to (8,0).\nIf I go UP to (7,1), I am not going back.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,0), I am going back. That's death.\nSo LEFT and UP are valid non-backward moves.\n\nI will stick with LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

This move immediately collects an apple, increasing my score from 12 to 13 apples (the apple at (3,1) is currently available and not occupied by any snake). This gives me a significant lead over the enemy snake at 7 apples. After eating, I'll be positioned at (3,1) with the apple at (2,1) diagonally up-right and (2,4) diagonally up-right, both within easy reach. The apples at (6,1) and (6,7) are on the right side where the enemy snake is positioned, so I should focus on the left side apples first to avoid competition.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter moving to (3,1) and collecting the apple, I should prioritize collecting the apple at (2,1) which will be diagonally up-right from my new position. The apple at (2,4) is also relatively close. I need to be aware of the enemy snake at (6,0) which is moving on the right side of the board, and avoid head-on collisions. With the score at 13-7 in my favor, I should continue to be aggressive in collecting apples while maintaining awareness of the enemy's position. The left side of the board has multiple apples clustered together, so I should focus on that area while keeping an eye on (6,1) and (6,7) as alternative targets. I should avoid the left edge where my body is concentrated, and instead work toward the center and right side of the board where more apples are located. I need to be careful not to get trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends, and maintain multiple safe follow-up moves.\n\nDOWN",

Death.\n    *   **LEFT (4, 0):** Empty (based on board state `0 . . . . . 0 T T T .` for y=0, index 4 is empty). Safe.\n\n3.  **Strategy:**\n    *   I need to avoid the immediate death of moving into `(6, 0)`. So LEFT or UP are the only valid choices.\n    *   Looking at the apples: `(2, 1)`, `(6, 1)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)`, `(6, 7)`.\n    *   From `(5, 0)`, moving UP places me at `(5, 1)`. From `(5, 1)`, I can go to `(4, 1)` (towards `(2, 1)` and `(4, 4)`) or `(6, 1)` (which is an apple). `(5, 1)` is a good central pivot.\n    *   From `(5, 0)`, moving LEFT places me at `(4, 0)`. From `(4, 0)`, I could go UP to `(4, 1)`, but `x=5` is generally a better starting column for accessing both the apples at `x=4` and `x=6`.\n    *   Checking the board for `(5, 1)`: The y=1 row is `. . A 1 . . A . T .`. The cell at index 5 is `.`. So `(5, 1)` is empty.\n    *   My plan is to move UP to access the vertical apples at `x=6` and the apples at `x=4,2` more efficiently.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** UP is the optimal move to maintain access to multiple apple clusters while avoiding my body.\n\nUP",

This move also keeps me away from the right side where the enemy snake is positioned.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter moving to (2,1) and collecting the apple, I should prioritize collecting the apple at (2,4) which will be directly above me at (2,4). The apple at (4,4) is also relatively close at (4,4). The apples at (6,1) and (6,7) are on the right side where the enemy snake is positioned, so I should focus on the left side apples first to avoid competition. With the score at 14-7 in my favor, I should continue to be aggressive in collecting apples while maintaining awareness of the enemy's position.

Moving here would result in a collision and death. **Unsafe.**\n2.  **DOWN (6, 0):** Looking at the board, coordinate (6, 0) contains 'T' (part of my own body). Moving backwards into my own body is illegal/suicidal. **Unsafe.**\n3.  **LEFT (5, 1):** Looking at the board, coordinate (5, 1) contains '0' (part of my own body, specifically my neck). Moving backwards into my own body is illegal/suicidal. **Unsafe.**\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 1):** Looking at the board, coordinate (7, 1) is empty ('.'). This move is valid and keeps me alive.\n\nSince **RIGHT** is the *only* valid move that avoids immediate death, it is the forced choice.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSurvive the immediate turn by moving Right. From (7, 1), I will need to navigate upwards to access the apple at (6, 7) or find a path down to the lower apples at (4,4) and (3,4), while staying clear of Enemy Snake #1's body.\n\nRIGHT",

The apple at (2,4) is right above me and this move positions me perfectly to collect it.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter moving to (2,3), I should eat the apple at (2,4) on my next move to reach 15 apples total. After that, I have several options for the remaining apples in the cluster: (3,4) and (4,4) are both within reach. I should continue to focus on the left side of the board where there are multiple apples clustered together. The apples at (6,1) and (6,7) are on the right side where the enemy snake is positioned, so I should avoid that area for now to minimize competition. With the score at 15-8 in my favor after this apple, I should continue to be aggressive in collecting apples while maintaining awareness of the enemy's position. I need to be careful not to get trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends, and maintain multiple safe follow-up moves.\n\nUP",

It is not part of my body (my body spans y=0,1). **Safe.**\n    *   **DOWN (7, 1):** The cell `(7, 1)` is marked as my body (implied by the previous turn's board state where it was `T`, and explicitly listed in my body segments). Moving here is fatal. **Unsafe.**\n    *   **LEFT (6, 2):** The cell `(6, 2)` is unknown. However, based on the map, `(5, 2)` is part of Snake #1's body (`T`). Moving to `(6, 2)` puts me adjacent to Snake #1. It is likely safe for one turn, but potentially risky if Snake #1 moves to cut me off.\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 2):** The cell `(8, 2)` is unknown. It is clear of my body. **Safe.**\n\n3.  **Strategic Considerations & Apple Pathing:**\n    *   **Snake #1:** Head at `(2, 4)`. Body spans from `(2, 4)` down to `(2, 1)` and snakes down to `(5, 4)`.\n    *   **Path to the Top:** The upper right quadrant (x=7-9, y=3-9) is currently empty. The only blocking snake is Snake #1, which is anchored on the left side (x=2-5).\n    *   **Apple Proximity:**\n        *   `(6, 7)` (Apple): Currently blocked by Snake #1's body at `(5, 6)`.\n        *   `(4, 8)` (Apple): Blocked by Snake #1 at `(4, 6)` and `(5, 5)`.\n        *   **Strategy:** To access the apples at y=7 and y=8, I need to circumnavigate Snake #1. The safest route is to **go UP** into the open space (x=7-9), traverse to the top, and come down the right side (x=9), bypassing Snake #1 entirely (which is mostly located at x=2-5).\n    *   **Comparing UP vs RIGHT:**\n        *   Going **UP** keeps me aligned with the open column at x=7, leading to y=8 which is directly above the apple at `(6, 7)`.\n        *   Going **RIGHT** moves me to x=8. While also safe, I currently have a gap of 1 unit between my head and the wall at x=9. Going UP allows me to utilize the space at `(7, 3)` through `(7, 9)` first, keeping my options more open to switch columns later.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The only guaranteed safe move that pushes me towards the open territory where the apples are located is **UP**. This move opens up the path to the top-right corner and allows me to flank Snake #1.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move UP to (7,3) and continue ascending along the x=7 or x=8 axis to reach y=8-9. Once at the top, navigate left to x=5 or x=6 to approach the apples at (6,7) and (4,8) from above, avoiding collision with Snake #1.\n\nUP",

I can see a clear path up the x=7 column all the way to the top wall at y=9. This position `(7, 4)` is occupied by Snake #1's tail, but since the tail moves forward as the snake moves (or leaves the board if the snake is moving forward, but here the snake is stationary), I need to be cautious. However, `(7, 4)` is currently empty. This move is **Safe** and maintains my momentum into open territory.\n    *   **LEFT (6, 3):** This puts me next to `(5, 3)`, which is part of Snake #1's body. It is a valid move, but it brings me closer to the enemy.\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 3):** This puts me in the right column. While safe, it doesn't align as well with the open pathway at the top as the x=7 column does (the gap at the top is better aligned with x=7 or x=8).\n    *   **DOWN (7, 2):** This is my previous position, occupied by my own body. **Unsafe.**\n\n4.  **Strategic Plan:**\n    *   I have a clear corridor to the top at x=7.\n    *   Snake #1 is blocking the approach to the top-center apples at `(4, 8)` and `(6, 7)`.\n    *   My plan is to ascend to the top (y=9), traverse left across the top row to x=5 or x=6, and then descend to eat the apples at `(6, 7)` and `(4, 8)` from above.\n    *   Continuing UP keeps me on this path and avoids the tight spaces near Snake #1.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Continue UP to (7, 4).

Leads to the center, closer to apples `(6, 7)` and `(4, 8)`.\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 4):**\n        *   **Obstacles:** Empty `.`.\n        *   **Snake #1 Movement:** Safe regarding Snake #1.\n        *   **Strategic Value:** Moves me towards the right wall. While it maintains space, it moves away from the cluster of apples at `(6, 7)` and `(4, 8)`.\n        *   **Result:** **Safe**, but less optimal than LEFT.\n\n4.  **Strategic Plan:**\n    *   I am currently pinned. My UP and DOWN moves are fatal.\n    *   I must choose between LEFT and RIGHT.\n    *   Choosing LEFT moves me towards the center and the apples. Choosing RIGHT moves me towards the edge.\n    *   The apple at `(4, 4)` is effectively lost to Snake #1 for this turn, as their head is already on it. I must look past it to the next targets.\n    *   Continuing towards the center allows me to flank Snake #1 from the right (x=6), positioning me well to dive on `(6, 7)` or `(4, 8)` in subsequent turns.\n    *   Therefore, **LEFT** is the optimal move to maintain offensive potential.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move LEFT to (6, 4) to navigate around the blocked column and engage the center. From there, I will assess the path to the apples at (6, 7) and (4, 8), attempting to flank Snake #1.\n\nLEFT",
