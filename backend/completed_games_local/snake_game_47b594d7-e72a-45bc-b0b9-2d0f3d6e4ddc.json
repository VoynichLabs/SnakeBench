So no head-on collision risk.  \n\n**Step 3: Consider future safety/apple access**\n\nLong-term plan: get apples while staying safe.  \nRemaining close apples:  \n- (2,7) is only 2 moves away (Manhattan from (8,7): 6 steps) but there is (3,8), (2,4).  \n- (3,8) is actually closer: from (8,7): dx = 5, dy = 1 \u2192 Manhattan 6, but can reach in fewer moves if I head left/up.  \n\n**Step 4: Mobility assessment**\n\nFrom (8,7):  \n- UP \u2192 (8,8): next moves from there: can go LEFT (7,8), RIGHT (9,8), DOWN (8,7) \u2014 3 options potentially; near wall at right edge.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,6): next moves: UP (8,7), LEFT (7,6), RIGHT (9,6) \u2014 still near wall at right; better slightly.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,7): more central, opens more options: can go UP (7,8), LEFT (6,7), DOWN (7,6), RIGHT (8,7) \u2014 4 options, maximum mobility, moves towards center and apples.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,7): corner with fewer options (UP, DOWN, LEFT) \u2014 less flexible, riskier later.\n\n**Step 5: Path to nearest apple (3,8) from (8,7)**  \n\nBest path: reduce x and increase y. So LEFT and UP both help. But doing LEFT first keeps more options open to adjust.  \n\nThus: LEFT toward center to have better escape routes and approach apple (3,8).\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move toward apple (3,8) via (7,7) \u2192 possibly (6,7) or (7,8), etc., while avoiding dead ends.

Eating it grows me to length 5. Snake #1 is at (1,2), which is 5 Manhattan distance away \u2014 it could potentially reach (2,7) in 2 moves, but not this turn. Since we move simultaneously, I can grab it safely if I move LEFT.\n\n**Step 3: Mobility after each move**\n\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,7): eating apple. Next turn moves: UP (2,8) safe, DOWN (2,6) safe, LEFT (1,7) safe, RIGHT (3,7) \u2014 my old head position \u2014 but my tail will move? Wait \u2014 after eating, my tail stays put, so my body becomes [(2,7), (3,7), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8)]. So (3,7) is now my body segment \u2014 unsafe to move RIGHT back into it. So next turn from (2,7): UP, DOWN, LEFT safe \u2014 3 moves.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,6): next turn moves: UP (3,7) safe (tail might move? Actually tail stays if no apple eaten, so (3,7) becomes free? Let's check: body is [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,8)] \u2014 so (3,7) is body segment \u2014 unsafe. So UP unsafe. DOWN (3,5) safe, LEFT (2,6) safe, RIGHT (4,6) safe \u2014 so 3 safe moves.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,7): next turn moves: UP (4,8) \u2014 body segment \u2014 unsafe, DOWN (4,6) safe, LEFT (3,7) \u2014 body segment \u2014 unsafe, RIGHT (5,7) safe \u2014 so 2 safe moves.\n\nLEFT gives apple and 3 safe moves next turn. DOWN gives 3 safe moves but no apple. RIGHT gives only 2 safe moves.\n\n**Step 4: Risk from snake #1**\n\nSnake #1 at (1,2) might move UP to (1,3), DOWN to (1,1), LEFT off board (death), RIGHT to (2,2) (apple there). It will likely avoid suicide, so UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. It might go toward apple (2,2) or (1,4). Not an immediate threat to (2,7) this turn.\n\n**Step 5: Decision**\n\nLEFT gets apple, good mobility, and increases my score to 4 apples (tying snake #1). DOWN is safe but misses the apple. RIGHT is less flexible.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating apple at (2,7), my body will be longer. Next turn from (2,7), avoid moving RIGHT into (3,7) body segment. Prefer UP/DOWN/LEFT to open space. Possibly aim for apple at (1,4) or (2,2) afterward, but watch snake #1's movements.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "**Thinking this turn:**\n\nMy head is at (2,5), body at [(2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8)], length 5. Snake #1's head is at (2,4), body at [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (0,1)], length 5.\n\n**Step 1: Check safe moves from (2,5)**\n\n- UP \u2192 (2,6) \u2014 my own body segment (neck), unsafe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,4) \u2014 Snake #1's head is there \u2014 possible head-on collision if snake #1 moves UP into (2,5) simultaneously? Wait: Snake #1 at (2,4) can move UP to (2,5) this turn. If I move DOWN to (2,4) and snake #1 moves UP to (2,5), we swap positions without collision. But if snake #1 moves LEFT to (1,4) or RIGHT to (3,4) or DOWN to (2,3), then (2,4) is empty. However, if snake #1 stays still (impossible) or moves into me, it's risky. Actually, if both heads move into the same cell, both die. If I move DOWN to (2,4) and snake #1 also moves into (2,4) (from its current position), that's impossible because it's already there \u2014 so snake #1 must move away from (2,4) for me to enter it safely. But if snake #1 moves UP to (2,5), then (2,4) becomes its body segment (since it grew if it ate an apple? No apples at (2,4)). Wait, check apples: apples at (5,6), (2,2), (8,3), (8,8), (3,1). None at (2,4). So snake #1's tail is at (0,1), so if it moves UP to (2,5), its old head position (2,4) becomes body? Actually, in Snake, when a snake moves, the head moves forward and the tail follows unless it eats an apple. So if snake #1 moves UP to (2,5), its body segments shift: new head at (2,5), then segment at (2,4) (old head), then (1,4), etc. So if I move DOWN to (2,4) on the same turn snake #1 moves UP to (2,5), then (2,4) is now a body segment of snake #1 (the second segment) \u2014 so I'd die moving into its body. So DOWN is unsafe because snake #1 might move UP.\n\nSimilarly, if snake #1 moves LEFT to (1,4) or RIGHT to (3,4) or DOWN to (2,3), then (2,4) is empty, so safe. But since we move simultaneously, I can't know. So I must treat (2,4) as potentially occupied by snake #1's body after movement if snake #1 moves in certain ways. The rules say: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" After movement, if (2,4) contains any part of snake #1's body, I die. When is (2,4) part of snake #1's body after this turn? If snake #1 moves UP to (2,5), then (2,4) becomes its body segment. If snake #1 moves DOWN to (2,3), then (2,4) is empty (since head left it). If snake #1 moves LEFT to (1,4), then (2,4) is empty. If snake #1 moves RIGHT to (3,4), then (2,4) is empty. So only if snake #1 moves UP, (2,4) becomes its body. Since I can't predict snake #1's move, moving DOWN is risky \u2014 it might be safe if snake #1 doesn't move UP, but it's not guaranteed safe. The safe move criterion is: avoid moves that *could* kill you. Since there's a chance snake #1 moves UP and causes (2,4) to be its body, DOWN is unsafe. So eliminate DOWN.\n\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,5) \u2014 in bounds, no snakes there now. Could snake #1 move there? Snake #1 at (2,4) can move UP to (2,5), DOWN to (2,3), LEFT to (1,4), RIGHT to (3,4). So (1,5) is not reachable by snake #1 in one move. So safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,5) \u2014 in bounds, no snakes there now. Snake #1 can't reach it in one move. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Apple opportunities**\n\nApples: (5,6), (2,2), (8,3), (8,8), (3,1).\n\n- Apple at (3,1) is 4 steps away (RIGHT then DOWN thrice).  \n- Apple at (2,2) is 3 steps away (LEFT then DOWN twice).  \n- Apple at (5,6) is 4 steps away (RIGHT thrice then UP).  \nSnake #1 is at (2,4) and might go for (2,2) or (3,1).\n\n**Step 3: Mobility after each move**\n\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,5): next turn moves: UP (1,6) safe, DOWN (1,4) \u2014 snake #1's body segment at (1,4)? Wait, current board: snake #1's body includes (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (0,1). So (1,4) is a body segment. If snake #1 moves, that segment may shift, but if snake #1 moves UP to (2,5), then (1,4) remains body (second segment shifts to (1,4)? Actually, after movement, body segments shift: if snake #1 moves UP to (2,5), new body: (2,5) head, then (2,4), then (1,4), etc. So (1,4) is still body. So DOWN to (1,4) is unsafe next turn. Similarly, if snake #1 moves other directions, (1,4) might remain body or not? Actually, if snake #1 moves LEFT to (1,4) \u2014 impossible, it's already occupied by its body? Wait, snake #1's head at (2,4), body at (1,4), so it can't move LEFT into its own body. So snake #1 won't move LEFT. So (1,4) will remain a body segment regardless. So next turn from (1,5): UP (1,6) safe, DOWN (1,4) unsafe (snake #1 body), LEFT (0,5) safe, RIGHT (2,5) \u2014 my body? My body will be at (2,5) current head, (2,6), etc. So (2,5) will be my neck \u2014 unsafe. So only UP and LEFT are safe next turn \u2192 2 safe moves.\n\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,5): next turn moves: UP (3,6) safe, DOWN (3,4) safe, LEFT (2,5) \u2014 my neck unsafe, RIGHT (4,5) safe \u2192 3 safe moves.\n\nSo RIGHT gives better mobility (3 safe moves) than LEFT (2 safe moves).\n\n**Step 4: Risk from snake #1**\n\nSnake #1 at (2,4) might move UP to (2,5) \u2014 if I go LEFT to (1,5), I'm away from it. If I go RIGHT to (3,5), also away. No immediate collision risk this turn. But if snake #1 moves UP to (2,5), it's where my neck is, so no issue for me this turn.\n\n**Step 5: Decision**\n\nLEFT leads to fewer future moves (2), RIGHT gives 3 future moves. RIGHT also moves me toward apple at (5,6) and (3,1). LEFT moves me toward apple at (2,2) but near snake #1's body area. Given the mobility advantage, RIGHT is better.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After RIGHT to (3,5), consider moving DOWN toward (3,1) apple or RIGHT toward (5,6), while keeping mobility high.\n\nRIGHT",

Follow-ups: UP (5,4), RIGHT (6,3), LEFT (4,3). Positions I closer to potential zigzags north/east but farther from the closest south apples ((4,4), (3,4)). Decent option, but not optimally positioning for immediate eats.\n  - DOWN: (5,1) - Directly into my own body, dies. Eliminate.\n  - LEFT: (4,2) - Open and clear. Follow-ups: UP (4,3 - leads toward (4,4) apple), RIGHT (5,2 body), DOWN (4,1 body), LEFT (3,2). Keeps strong options open, moves directly toward south apples ((4,4), (3,4) ~2-3 moves away), and distances me from enemy's northern territory.\n  - RIGHT: (6,2) - Open and clear. Follow-ups: UP (6,3), RIGHT (7,2), DOWN (6,1), LEFT (5,2 body). Moves toward eastern apple ((8,3) ~3 moves away via RIGHT-RIGHT-UP), but south apples are closer; good options but less immediate eating potential.\n- Enemy snake #0 head at (7,7): Possible moves: UP (7,8 - toward (8,8) apple), RIGHT (8,7 - toward (8,8) via row 7), DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7 own body dies). They could eliminate or approach northern apples (e.g., eat (8,8) or (6,8) next turn, reducing advantage). No immediate threat to my old plan's zigzags, but their north focus favors me prioritizing south apples first.\n- Apples: South cluster ((4,4), (3,4)) is reachable in 2-4 turns from LEFT move; (8,3) farther east via RIGHT. Prioritizing LEFT keeps generating apples quickly (next turn could eat (4,4) at my lead at 10 vs. their 6 or 7).\n\n### Decision\nLEFT: Safest move toward closest apples, maintains strong future options to zig up/east after eats, bypasses potential enemy sweeps north, and secures short-term growth to 10+ apples.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Turns\nAfter LEFT to (4,2), UP to (4,3) then UP to (4,4) for 10 apples. From there, pivot LEFT to (4,3) wait (3,3 from (4,4)), then zig LEFT/RIGHT to (3,4) for 11 apples. Zig north/east (e.g., RIGHT to (4,4 if eating, or from (3,3)) toward (8,3) in 3-4 more moves for 12. Watch enemy; if they overcommit north, boost to 45-50 in <40 turns by circling board edges.\n\nLEFT",

Follow-ups: LEFT (3,4 apple), RIGHT (5,4), keeps multiple options open.\n  - DOWN: (4,2) - Own body directly behind head, dies immediately.\n  - LEFT: (3,3) - Open. Follow-ups: UP (3,4 apple). Other directions trap (DOWN to (3,2) leaves only UP (back into body), die next).\n  - RIGHT: (5,3) - Open. Follow-ups: UP (5,4), RIGHT (6,3). Could zigzag toward apples (e.g., UP then LEFT to (4,4)), but 2-3 moves vs. 1 for UP, and less efficient.\n- Enemy snake #0 head at (8,8): Likely RIGHT (9,8) or DOWN (8,7) for southern apples (e.g., (8,3)), no immediate threat; they'll be north-focused.\n- Apples: UP grabs (4,4) immediately for 10 apples. (3,4) reachable post-UP.\n\n### Decision\nUP: Safest and most efficient toward apple and growth, maximizes options for chaining to (3,4), avoids LEFT's trap risk and RIGHT's detour. Keeps lead (9 vs. 7).\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Turns\nEat (4,4) this UP, head to (4,4), grow to 10. Immediately LEFT to (3,4) eat for 11. From (3,4), UP/LEFT to clear southwest space and approach (8,3) while enemy threatens north; aim for 12-13 south, then north sweep if enemy stalls. Maintain 2+ escape routes, avoid enemy head at (8,8) potential DOWN path.\n\nUP",

Follow-ups: UP (3,5) or DOWN (3,3) for space clearance toward south (e.g., (1,6)) or west-east flexibility; avoids traps as tail blocks only one direction post-growth, keeps 2+ options.\n  - RIGHT: (5,4) - Empty, expands right space, potential path to avoid north crowding or angle toward enemy weak spots, but no immediate apple (apple chase requires 2-3 moves vs. 1 for LEFT), slightly riskier if enemy pushes south later.\n- Enemy head at (8,7): Likely UP to (8,8) for (4,8) or (6,8) cluster (north focus). Possible RIGHT (9,7) > DOWN (8,6, risky); no head-on threat to my moves, but their body blocks east-north routes. Lead maintained (10 vs. 7), no trap risk yet.\n- Apples: LEFT grabs (3,4) immediately; north (4,8,6,8) via UP/LEFT combo (3-5 moves); south (1,6,8,3 farther). LEFT best for quick score without detour.\n\n### Decision\nLEFT: Safest, directly eats (3,4) for growth/lead, maximizes efficient apple proximity while preserving escape routes (avoiding RIGHT's inefficiency or UP's north-only bias). Keeps southwest options open for tail-shifting toward (1,6) or (8,3) loop.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Turns\nEat (3,4) this LEFT, head (3,4), to 11 apples. Next, assess from there: UP to (3,5) for vertical mobility toward north apples if enemyNorth pauses, or DOWN to (3,3) southward for (1,6) clearance.

Safe moves (no board edge, no self-collision/backwards, no direct move into enemy body; simultaneous moves assumed):\n  - UP: (3,7) - Empty cell, clear path north with multiple options (RIGHT/LEFT future). Advances toward north apples (4,8 and 6,8); avoids enemy vicinity. Keeps y=7-9 open and expandable westward/eastward.\n  - LEFT: (2,6) - Empty; leads toward (1,6) apple in 1-2 moves, but x=1-2 column has own body crowding lower rows ((2,1),(2,2)), limiting exits after eating (e.g., only UP/DOWN viable post-eat, DOWN risks body contact). Less optimal than UP's broader north access.\n  - RIGHT: (4,6) - Empty; similar north/east options as UP but requires RIGHT this turn, adding a lateral shift versus direct UP (aligns closer to (4,8) path but diverges slightly from head north; sets up UP to (4,7) next for (4,8) in 2 moves). Good, but UP keeps straighter north trajectory per last plan.\n- Enemy (#0): Head at (8,4), length 8. Likely safe moves: UP to (8,5) (toward (8,3) apple or north), RIGHT to (9,4) (edge risk only if further obstructed), or LEFT/DOWN toward south apples. Not immediately threatening my path; north competition possible but distant (6-7 moves to overlap).\n- Apples: North cluster ((4,8), (6,8)) priority (reachable in 2-4 moves via UP path), south ((1,6), (3,2)) viable but detour-heavy/riskier due to body positions. East (8,3) far and contested. DOWN invalid due to self-body at (3,5)/rules.\n- Other: My 11 apples vs. enemy's 7; maintain lead. Avoid dead-ends/traps (north open, south tighter). Simultaneous collisions: No obvious head-on risk in safe moves.\n\n### Decision\nUP: Safest, most efficient toward primary apples while preserving options/future paths. Outperforms LEFT's bottleneck southward and RIGHT's itinerary detour for minimal gains.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Turns\nContinue UP to (3,7), then UP immediately again to (3,8). From (3,8), RIGHT to (4,8) eat (apples to 12); RIGHT to (5,8); RIGHT to (6,8) eat (to 13). Post-eat at (6,8), evaluate enemy (if north-pursuing, evade RIGHT/UP toward x=9 y=7-8 space; otherwise, head LEFT/WEST for (1,6) eat (14) then DOWN/LEFT for (3,2) (15), or EAST for (8,3) if south options exhaust).

Safe moves (no edge, no self-collision/backwards, no enemy body):\n  - UP: (3,8) - Empty; aligns with last plan to proceed north toward (4,8) and (6,8) apples; keeps broad open space north (y=8-9, x=0-9 mostly clear) for multiple future options (RIGHT/LEFT/UP); enemy far south, no immediate threat.\n  - LEFT: (2,7) - Empty; could pivot toward (1,6) apple (e.g., LEFT/DOWN to (2,6) next, then LEFT to (1,6) if empty, eat in 2 moves), but this deviates south into tighter space (my body at x=2-5 y=1-4 crowding below), limiting escapes post-eat (only UP or potential RIGHT trapped); less efficient than UP's direct path to multiple north apples with branch options.\n  - RIGHT: (4,7) - Empty; similar north access as UP (RIGHT to (4,8) eat next turn, then RIGHT/UP options), but shifts laterally this turn, requiring later correction (e.g., to align with (6,8)) versus UP's straighter north trajectory; still viable but UP follows communicated plan better.\n- Enemy (#0): Head at (8,3), length 9. Likely safe moves: LEFT to (7,3) (southwest toward bottom apples), RIGHT to (9,3) (east toward potential clears), DOWN to (8,2) (south toward (3,2) area). No head-on collision risk with my safe moves; enemy distant (at least 4-5 moves from y=7-8 overlap), so I'll prioritize apple approach while monitoring for northward rushes.\n- Apples: North cluster ((4,8)/(6,8)) best (UP advances 1 step closer, reachable in 2-3 moves total after this); (1,6) viable via LEFT but detour-y with dead-end risks post-eat; (3,2)/(0,8) farther south, less optimal now.\n- Other: Lead at 11 vs. 8 apples; no dead-ends in north path. Simultaneous: Clear space, no mutual threats.\n\n### Decision\nUP: Safest and efficient per plan, directly advances toward two apples in 2-3 moves while maxing open futures. Avoids LEFT's tighter south detour and RIGHT's minor inefficiency for net gains.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Turns\nProceed UP to (3,8) now, then from (3,8) RIGHT to (4,8) eat (apples to 12, grow to length 13); then RIGHT to (5,8); then RIGHT to (6,8) eat (to 13, length 14). Post-eat at (6,8), assess: if enemy pursues (e.g., via right flank), evade RIGHT to (7,8) or UP to (6,9) if open; else, LEFT to (5,8) then DOWN for clearance, heading WEST to (1,6) eat (14) or further for (3,2) (15). Aim to surge ahead to 50 (~17 more apples, reach 50 before enemy if possible); watch enemy movements for interception risks at northeast apples.\nUP",

Deviates slightly from last plan's direct RIGHT to (4,8) apple, but still solid for apple pursuit with escapes; enemy is south, no near threats.\n  - LEFT: (2,8) - Empty; shifts west toward (0,8) apple (e.g., LEFT to (1,8) next, possibly eat in 2-3 moves if path clears), but this is a detour south into tighter areas (my body clusters at x=3-5 y=1-4 below), reducing post-eat maneuverability (limited to UP or constrained RIGHT, vs. north's open field); less efficient than direct apple access north.\n  - RIGHT: (4,8) - Apple; direct eat (apples to 12, grow to length 13), perfect alignment with last plan (proceed to (4,8) eat, then (6,8)).

Safe moves likely: UP to (7,5), DOWN to (7,3), LEFT to (6,4). Oriented southward/eastward (possible toward (3,2) apple), still 4-5 moves minimum from my northeast cluster; no imminent head-on or blockage on RIGHT path. Monitor northward rushes but prioritize my apples (14+ advantage now expands).\n- Apples: (6,8) directly via RIGHT in 2 moves; (0,8) requires later LEFT pivot after eating, but south detour less urgent. HEAD RIGHT facilitates quick eats with open north escapes; no dead-ends near RIGHT trajectory.\n- Other: Simultaneous moves pose low collision risk; avoid UP/DOWN for less efficient apple pursuit vs. RIGHT's direct, flexible approach. Solid to maintain +4 apple lead and aim for more.\n\n### Decision\nRIGHT: Continues per last plan toward undeniable apple eat at (6,8) in 2 steps, builds growth confidently with northward options, superior to detours.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Turns\nRIGHT to (5,8) this turn. Next (turn 30), RIGHT to (6,8) eat (to apples 13, length 14). From (6,8), avoid RIGHT (0 body). Prefer UP to (6,9) open for broad north space (e.g., RIGHT then explore 7-9 rows) or LEFT to (5,8) refuel then down. Evade enemy north pushes (e.g., loop to block if chasing); pivot south for (1,6)/(3,2)/(0,8) if needed. Push apples to 15-20 quickly via safe clusters before enemy catches up.\nRIGHT",

DOWN is risky \u2014 leads to potential trap.\n- RIGHT to (9,7): Next moves: UP (9,8) safe, DOWN (9,6) safe, LEFT (8,7) neck unsafe, RIGHT off board unsafe \u2192 2 safe moves.\n\nUP gives 3 safe moves, RIGHT gives 2 safe moves, DOWN gives 1 safe move \u2192 avoid DOWN.\n\n**Step 4: Risk from snake #1**\n\nSnake #1 at (7,9) can move UP (off board) unsafe, DOWN (7,8) empty safe, LEFT (6,9) body unsafe, RIGHT (8,9) safe.  \nSo its safe moves: DOWN to (7,8) or RIGHT to (8,9).  \nIf it goes RIGHT to (8,9), it\u2019s adjacent to my UP target (8,8) \u2014 risky next turn if I go UP.  \nIf it goes DOWN to (7,8), it moves away from me.\n\nRIGHT to (9,7) avoids immediate adjacency risk with snake #1\u2019s possible moves.\n\n**Step 5: Avoid trapping**\n\nDOWN is too limiting (only 1 safe move next). UP is good mobility but risks snake #1 moving to (8,9) and blocking me. RIGHT is safer short-term but slightly less mobility next turn (2 moves). However, RIGHT positions me to go UP to (9,8) next turn for the apple if snake #1 doesn\u2019t take it first.\n\nGiven snake #1\u2019s length advantage, avoiding potential head-on collision is key. RIGHT seems safer because snake #1 can\u2019t reach (9,7) this turn and its possible moves don\u2019t threaten (9,7) directly.\n\n**Step 6: Decision**\n\nUP risks confrontation if snake #1 goes RIGHT. RIGHT avoids that and still allows apple (9,8) next turn. DOWN is too dangerous due to low mobility.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After RIGHT to (9,7), next turn consider UP to (9,8) for apple if safe, else DOWN to (9,6) to avoid snake #1 if it approaches. Long-term: after eating (9,8), head down left toward other apples while avoiding snake #1\u2019s long body.\n\nRIGHT",

Eating the apple at (9,8) is tempting but puts me adjacent to snake #1\u2019s possible position (9,9) if it moves RIGHT. However, snake #1 might not go RIGHT \u2014 it could go DOWN to (8,8).  \n\nGiven snake #1\u2019s length advantage, head-on collision would kill me. But if I eat the apple, I grow to length 9, still shorter than snake #1\u2019s 13, so head-on collision kills both \u2014 but that\u2019s bad for me since I\u2019m behind in apples.  \n\nDOWN seems safer to avoid potential confrontation. But avoiding the apple might let snake #1 take it next turn, widening its lead.\n\n**Step 6: Decision**\n\nUP to eat the apple is risky but beneficial if snake #1 doesn\u2019t move RIGHT. DOWN is safer but gives up the apple. Since the game is long (150 turns) and I\u2019m behind, I need to catch up \u2014 taking calculated risks is necessary. Also, after eating, I can avoid (9,9) next turn if snake #1 is there.\n\nI\u2019ll take the apple and deal with the consequences next turn.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After UP to (9,8), check snake #1\u2019s position. If it\u2019s at (9,9), avoid UP next turn \u2014 go LEFT or DOWN. If it\u2019s elsewhere, consider moving toward other apples while avoiding snake #1\u2019s body.\n\nUP",
