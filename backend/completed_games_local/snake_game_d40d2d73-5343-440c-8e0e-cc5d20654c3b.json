The closest apple to me is at (4,1), which is directly to my right (x+1).\n2. The enemy snake is far away (at (8,2)), so no immediate collision risk.\n3. I have no body, so I can't hit myself by moving backwards.\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n1. **UP (y+1)**: Move to (3,2). This is safe (no walls, no bodies, no enemy).\n2. **DOWN (y-1)**: Move to (3,0). This is safe (no walls, no bodies, no enemy).\n3. **LEFT (x-1)**: Move to (2,1). This is safe (no walls, no bodies, no enemy).\n4. **RIGHT (x+1)**: Move to (4,1). This is safe and would let me eat the apple at (4,1).\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- Moving RIGHT to (4,1) is the best option because:\n  - It lets me eat an apple immediately, gaining a point and growing my body.\n  - It's safe (no collisions or walls).\n  - It moves me closer to other apples (e.g., (4,5) is directly above).\n- Other moves are safe but don't provide immediate benefits.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- After eating the apple at (4,1), I'll have a body segment at (3,1). I should then aim for the next closest apple, likely (4,5) or (5,2).\n- Avoid moving into positions where the enemy snake could trap me, but since it's far away, this isn't an immediate concern.\n\n**Final Move:**\nRIGHT",

This apple is only 3 units away horizontally, and moving left reduces that distance to 2 units.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Collect the apple at (5,2) first since it's closest\n- Then consider moving toward the apple at (4,1) or (4,5)\n- Keep monitoring enemy snake #1's position to avoid head-on collisions\n- Avoid getting too close to the board edges to maintain maneuverability\n\nLEFT",

The closest apples are at (6,4) and (7,4), both to the right and down from my head.\n2. The enemy snake is at (0,0), far from me and not an immediate threat.\n3. My body is at (5,6), (5,5), (4,5), (4,4), so moving left to (5,6) is into my own body (illegal).\n4. Moving up to (6,7) is safe and moves me closer to the apples at (6,8) and (7,8).\n5.

Safe and moves me closer to the apples at (7,4) and (7,8).\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- Moving UP to (6,7) or DOWN to (6,5) are both good options because:\n  - They are safe (no collisions or walls).\n  - They move me closer to the apples at (6,8), (7,8), (6,4), and (7,4).\n  - They keep future options open (can go up, left, or right next turn).\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,6) is also safe and provides immediate benefits.\n- Moving LEFT is illegal.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- After moving UP or DOWN, aim for the next closest apple, likely at (6,4) or (7,4).\n- Continue to prioritize apples while maintaining safety.\n- Avoid moving into positions where the enemy snake could trap me, but since it's not directly in my path, this isn't an immediate concern.\n\n**Final Move:**\nDOWN\n**END RATIONALE**",

Apples are at (6,0), (9,7), (5,1), (3,1), and (6,1).\n\n## Available Moves Analysis\n\n- **UP (5,3)**: This is into my own body at (5,3) - I die!\n- **DOWN (5,1)**: Safe move down - this is the apple at (5,1) - I eat it!\n- **LEFT (4,2)**: Safe move left\n- **RIGHT (6,2)**: Safe move right\n\n## Strategic Considerations\n\n**DOWN to (5,1)**:\n- Safe move and I get the apple!\n- This is an immediate point gain\n- Moves me toward the apple at (5,0) on the next turn\n- This is the highest priority move\n\n**LEFT to (4,2)**:\n- Safe move left\n- Moves me toward the apple at (3,1)\n- Gets me away from the center where the enemy snake is\n\n**RIGHT to (6,2)**:\n- Safe move right\n- Moves me toward the apple at (6,0) and (6,1)\n- Gets me away from the left side\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 Analysis**:\n- Head at (6,7) with body at (6,6), (5,6), (5,7), (4,7), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (7,7)\n- They're positioned above me and to the right\n- They're likely to move toward the apple at (6,0) or (9,7)\n\n## Best Move Decision\n\nDOWN to (5,1) is the best move:\n- Safe move and I get an immediate apple!\n- This increases my score and keeps me competitive with the enemy snake\n- Moves me toward the apple at (5,0) on the next turn\n- This is the highest priority move available\n\nDOWN",
