I'm at (1,4) with body at (1,3) and (2,3) - so I cannot move DOWN (would hit my own body at (1,3))\n2. The enemy is at (3,6) with body at (3,5) - they're to my right and slightly up\n3. Closest apples: (1,5) is directly above me (1 move away), (3,7) is above and to the right (but would require moving through enemy territory), (6,3) is to my right (but blocked by my body)\n4. The apple at (1,5) is directly above me and reachable in 1 move (UP)\n\n**Safe Moves Analysis:**\n- UP: (1,5) - safe (empty space with apple)\n- DOWN: (1,3) - unsafe (my own body)\n- LEFT: (0,4) - safe (empty space)\n- RIGHT: (2,4) - safe (empty space)\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n1. UP to (1,5) would let me eat the apple immediately\n2. LEFT to (0,4) would move me away from all apples and toward the edge\n3. RIGHT to (2,4) would move me toward the center but away from the nearest apple\n4. The enemy at (3,6) could move LEFT toward (2,6) or DOWN toward (3,5) (but (3,5) is their body)\n\n**Potential Enemy Moves:**\nThe enemy could move LEFT toward (2,6) to reach (1,5), or DOWN toward (3,5) (but that's their body), or UP toward (3,7) to reach the apple there. They're not currently on a collision course with me.\n\n**Decision:**\nUP is the best move because:\n- It lets me eat the apple at (1,5) immediately\n- It keeps me safe from my own body and the enemy\n- It gives me a point and grows my snake\n- It doesn't put me in immediate danger\n\n**Long-term note for next turn:**\nAfter eating the apple at (1,5), I'll be at (1,5) with body at [(1,4), (1,3), (2,3)]. I should then consider moving toward other apples while maintaining safety, possibly RIGHT toward (2,5) to reach (3,7) or continue UP toward (1,6) to reach (5,9) eventually.\n\nUP",

They cannot move LEFT to (0,4).\n- If I move UP to (3,7): Enemy moving UP to (1,5) would be safe - no collision.

This gives me good mobility options for future turns.\n- Moving towards (1,5) or (6,3) would take multiple moves and might put me in a position where the enemy gets the apple first.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe apple at (3,7) is the most immediate opportunity.

My best move is to head towards the apple at (3,0) since it's the most reachable for me right now.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,3) starts me on the path to (3,0). This is safer than moving UP (which could put me closer to the enemy's path) and more productive than moving DOWN.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nGet the apple at (3,0) to tie with the enemy at 4 apples. Then I can either go for the apple at (1,7) or try to get the apple at (9,5). I need to be very careful about the enemy's movements and avoid getting trapped.\n\nLEFT",

Let me analyze all possible moves:\n\n**Safety check:**\n- UP to (3,2): This would move me into my own body segment at (3,2) - I would die\n- DOWN to (3,0): Safe - no obstacles\n- LEFT to (2,1): Safe - no obstacles  \n- RIGHT to (4,1): Safe - no obstacles\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- Apples at: (9,5), (2,9), (3,0), (1,7), (2,0)\n- The apple at (3,0) is directly below me - moving DOWN would eat it immediately!\n- Enemy snake #0 is at (3,9) with body [(4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (4,7)]\n\n**Enemy movement analysis:**\nEnemy snake #0 can move:\n- UP to (3,10) - off board, not possible\n- DOWN to (3,8) - safe\n- LEFT to (2,9) - safe (and adjacent to the apple at (2,9))\n- RIGHT to (4,9) - safe\n\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (2,9), they would be positioned to get the apple at (2,9) next turn.\n\n**Decision reasoning:**\nMoving DOWN to (3,0) would immediately eat the apple, bringing me to 4 apples. This is the most direct and valuable move available. The enemy cannot reach me or block me from this apple.\n\nMoving LEFT to (2,1) could be a setup to go for the apple at (2,0), but that's less valuable than eating the apple right in front of me.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4,1) doesn't bring me closer to any immediate objectives.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nEat the apple at (3,0) to reach 4 apples. Then I can either go for the apple at (2,0) or try to get the apple at (1,7). I need to be very careful about the enemy's movements and avoid getting trapped. The enemy has more apples, so I need to be aggressive but safe.\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT to (4,7) would move me toward the right side of the board where there are apples at (9,5) and (9,7)\n4.

I should try to move along the left side of the board to avoid direct confrontation while positioning myself to collect apples. The apple at (3,8) is closest to my current position on the left side.

RIGHT to (7,7) would move me toward the apple at (9,7) but away from the closer apples\n4.

This means their head is at (6,7).\n\nThe enemy can move:\n- UP to (6,8) - this is their own body, so they cannot move there\n- DOWN to (6,6) - safe\n- LEFT to (5,7) - safe\n- RIGHT to (7,7) - safe\n\nSo the enemy will either move DOWN to (6,6), LEFT to (5,7), or RIGHT to (7,7).\n\n**Decision reasoning:**\nFrom my current position at (0,7) with body at (0,6), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), I have three safe moves available: UP to (0,8), DOWN to (0,6), or RIGHT to (1,7).\n\nMoving UP to (0,8) continues my movement up along the left edge of the board, which is a safe direction to head away from the enemy and toward the apple at (9,7). This keeps me on the left side of the board where I have more room to maneuver.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (1,7) moves me away from the left edge and into the middle of the board, which could put me in a more dangerous position if the enemy moves left. However, this direction moves me closer to the apple at (6,6) which is closer than (9,7).\n\nMoving DOWN to (0,6) would move me toward my own body segment, which is not ideal.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI need to be very careful of the enemy snake which is currently above me. I should try to move along the left side of the board to avoid direct confrontation while positioning myself to collect apples. The apple at (9,7) is closest to my current position on the left side. I should try to work my way up the left edge, being careful not to get trapped. I need to maintain 5 apples and work toward 50, so I need to be aggressive but safe. I should avoid the enemy's territory on the right side of the board.\n\nUP",

I should try to move away from the right edge and into the center of the board to avoid getting trapped. I should try to collect apples on the left side first, as they are safer and more accessible. I need to maintain a safe distance from the enemy snake and avoid getting too close to it. I should avoid the enemy's territory on the right side of the board and try to collect apples on the left side first. I need to work my way toward the apple at (3,4) which is closest to my current position. I should avoid moving toward the right edge as the enemy snake is currently there and will move UP or LEFT, putting it in a dangerous position.\nDOWN",
