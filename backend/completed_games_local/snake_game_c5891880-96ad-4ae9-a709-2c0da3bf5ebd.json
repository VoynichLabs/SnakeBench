After reaching (1,7), recalculate Manhattan distances to remaining apples ( (3,0), (1,2), (9,4), (8,1) ) and avoid the enemy\u2019s area near (8,1)/(9,4) until their body is manageable.\n4. If the enemy strays toward (1,7), switch to a secondary apple target (e.g., (1,2)) to maintain safety and collection momentum.\n\nUP",

Neither safe enemy head position overlaps with my safe new head positions ((5,6), (4,5), (6,5)) \u2192 no simultaneous head-on collision risk.\n\n4. **Evaluate Follow-Up Flexibility and Apple Proximity**\n   - **RIGHT (6,5)**: 3 follow-up safe options but moves away from all apples \u2192 low priority.\n   - **LEFT (4,5)**: 3 follow-up safe options but only indirectly advances toward the high-priority (2,6) apple \u2192 medium priority.\n   - **UP (5,6)**: 3 follow-up safe options, moves directly closer to the high-priority (2,6) apple (matches its y-coordinate), and keeps (1,7) accessible while avoiding enemy territory \u2192 highest priority.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Future Self (Next 3 Turns)\n1.

None of these overlap with my safe new head positions [(4,7), (4,5), (3,6)] \u2192 no head-on collision risk for any safe move.\n\n4. **Evaluate Follow-Up Flexibility and Apple Proximity**\n   - **DOWN (4,5)**: Moves away from all close apples; only 2 follow-up safe moves \u2192 low priority.\n   - **UP (4,7)**: 3 follow-up safe moves but shifts focus from the closest apple (2,6) \u2192 medium priority.\n   - **LEFT (3,6)**: 3 follow-up safe moves, moves directly closer to the closest reachable apple (2,6, same y-coordinate, x difference reduced by 1), and keeps (1,7) accessible \u2192 highest priority.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Future Self (Next 3 Turns)\n1. After moving LEFT this turn, my new body will be [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)] \u2192 avoid moving RIGHT (to (4,6)) next turn (fatal).\n2. Next turn, prioritize moving LEFT to (2,6) to eat that apple (closing the gap with Enemy #1\u2019s 7 apples) while verifying at least 2 follow-up safe options.\n3. After eating (2,6), assess Enemy #1\u2019s position \u2014 if they\u2019re still near lower y-coordinates (2,1), (3,0), shift focus to (1,7) to build an apple lead.\n4. For each future move, confirm the new head position has at least 2 follow-up safe options to avoid dead-ends.\n5. Avoid Enemy #1\u2019s immediate area until I have a larger apple buffer to reduce collision risk.\n\nLEFT",

After securing (1,7), target the (0,4) apple via down-left moves, confirming at least 2 follow-up safe moves per turn to avoid dead-ends.\n4. Continuously check Enemy #1\u2019s head position for potential collision risk if they move upward.\n\nUP",

Monitor Snake #1\u2019s movement toward lower-y apples but focus on securing nearby apples to close the 1-apple score gap. Avoid moving left into the tight upper-left corridor that limits future moves.\n\nRIGHT",
