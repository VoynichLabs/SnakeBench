Safe.\n- LEFT from (1,9): (0,9) - this is empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT from (1,9): (2,9) - this is empty. Safe.\n\nNow I need to consider enemy snake #0 at (1,7).

That's a significant risk.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0,9), I'm safe from immediate collision and I'm getting closer to the apple at (3,9) (distance 3 vs current distance 2, actually further away... wait, from (0,9) to (3,9) is 3 units, from (1,9) to (3,9) is 2 units.

But the enemy might not move UP - they might move in another direction. However, this is too risky.\n\nBetween LEFT (0,9) and RIGHT (2,9):\n- RIGHT moves me closer to apple at (3,9)\n- Both are safe\n- RIGHT keeps me more central on the board\n\nMy best move is RIGHT to get closer to the apple at (3,9) and avoid potential collision with the enemy.\n\nLong-term plan: Move toward the apple at (3,9) while keeping distance from enemy snake #0 at (1,7).

The enemy snake (#0) is at (3,7) - wait, let me re-read the board carefully.\n\nFrom the board:\n- Row 9: \". . T 1 . . . . . .\" - So at x=2, y=9 is \"T\" (tail), and x=3, y=9 is \"1\" (my head). So my head is at (3,9), body at (2,9).\n- Row 7: \". . . 0 . A . . . .\" - Wait, the description says \"Snake #0 - Head: (3, 7)\", but looking at row 7: \". . . 0 A . . . . .\" - that's x=3 is \"0\", x=4 is \"A\". So enemy head is at (3,7).\n\nSo:\n- My head: (3,9)\n- My body: [(2,9)]\n- Enemy head: (3,7)\n- Apples: (8,8), (4,7), (4,5), (4,3), (4,4) and also (3,9) was just collected last turn\n\nNow I need to choose my next move.\n\nPossible moves from (3,9):\n- UP: (3,10) - off board, DIE\n- DOWN: (3,8) - check row 8: \". . . . . . . . A .\" so (3,8) is empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: (2,9) - this is my tail. But it's moving away, so should be safe unless I was longer. I have length 2, so tail is at (2,9). If I go LEFT, I move to my tail position. Since my tail will also move, this should be safe. Let me verify: if I move LEFT to (2,9), and my tail moves from (2,9) to ??? Actually wait, since I have a body, when I move, my tail moves. So if I move LEFT to (2,9), my body becomes [(2,9), (3,9)] and tail moves? No, let me think. Head at (3,9), body [(2,9)]. If I go LEFT, new head (2,9), body becomes [(3,9)], tail becomes (3,9)? Actually the tail should move forward, so if I grow, tail stays. Let me recalculate: if I collect an apple, I grow, so tail doesn't move. But I didn't collect an apple this turn. So with length 2: head (3,9), tail (2,9). If I move LEFT to (2,9), that's into my own tail. But since the tail will move away, this is actually safe for length >=2. However, the rules say \"moving directly backwards into your own body\" counts as hitting yourself. Directly backwards from (3,9) going LEFT is (2,9), which is adjacent and is my body. So that's a backwards move. I die. So LEFT is NOT safe.\n- RIGHT: (4,9) - check row 9: \". . T 1 . . . . . .\" so (4,9) is empty. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN (3,8), RIGHT (4,9).\n\nNow, the enemy at (3,7) could move in any direction. If I move DOWN to (3,8), and enemy moves UP to (3,8), we collide head-on and both die. That's a risk.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4,9), I'm at (4,9) and enemy at (3,7), distance is more than 1, so no head-on collision possible this turn.\n\nAlso, I should look for apples. Apples are at (8,8), (4,7), (4,5), (4,3), (4,4). From (4,9), I'm getting closer to (4,7) and (8,8).\n\nSo RIGHT seems safer (no head-on collision risk) and positions me well.\n\nMy plan: Move RIGHT to (4,9) to avoid potential collision with enemy at (3,7) if they move UP. This keeps me alive and positions me near the vertical line of apples at x=4.\n\nRIGHT",

Since I have a body, moving into my tail is considered moving backwards into my own body, DIE.\n- **RIGHT**: (5, 9) - Empty. Safe.\n\n**2. Collision Analysis (HEAD-ON):**\n- **My potential move (DOWN) to (4, 8)**: The enemy is at (4, 7). If the enemy moves UP to (4, 8), we collide head-on and both die. The enemy is currently closest to the apples at (4, 5), (4, 3), etc., so moving UP/Down is likely. This is a significant risk.\n- **My potential move (RIGHT) to (5, 9)**: The enemy is at (4, 7). Even if the enemy moves diagonally (which they can't) or optimally towards apples (Down to (4, 6)), they cannot reach (5, 9). This is much safer.\n\n**3. Apple Proximity:**\n- **Moving DOWN**: Gets me closer to the vertical line of apples at x=4.\n- **Moving RIGHT**: Takes me away from that line but keeps me alive.\n\n**4. Strategy:**\nSince I cannot see the enemy's move, I must assume the worst-case scenario for risky moves. A collision with the enemy results in a draw (both die) or I lose if I have fewer apples (currently tied 1-1). Since I cannot win if I am dead, avoiding death is the priority.\nMoving RIGHT guarantees survival this turn. It also positions me at (5, 9), which is safe and allows me to maneuver toward the apples or other parts of the board next turn without immediate risk of collision.\n\nSurvival is the priority over a risky apple grab.\n\nRISK WARNING: According to the rules, moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die. However, with a snake of length 2, the cell directly behind the head is the body. The rules say \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" This specifically includes the body.\n*Wait*, the rules also say \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" This explicitly covers moving into the body segment.\nLet's re-read: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n\"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nIf I am at (4,9) and my body is at (3,9), moving LEFT to (3,9) puts my head where my body currently is. Since my body is there, I die.\nSo LEFT is definitely out.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving RIGHT is the only move that guarantees survival regardless of the enemy's choice, whereas moving DOWN risks a head-on collision if the enemy moves UP. I will move RIGHT to ensure I stay in the game.\n\nLong-term plan: Keep the head at (5,9) for now. Wait for the enemy to move into the apple column (x=4). Once the enemy clears the vertical path or moves away, I can descend to eat the apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Analysis of Current Position:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at (5, 9), Body at (4, 9).\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (4, 6), Body at (4, 7).\n*   **Apples:** Primarily clustered at x=4 (y=2, 3, 4, 5) and one at (8, 8).\n\n**2. Evaluating Move Options (from Head at (5, 9)):**\n*   **UP:** (5, 10) -> Off board. **DEAD.**\n*   **LEFT:** (4, 9) -> This cell is currently occupied by my own body segment. Even though the body will move, the rules state that moving into a body segment (including your own) results in death. **DEAD.**\n*   **DOWN:** (5, 8) -> Currently empty. However, the enemy snake is at (4, 6). The apples at (4, 5) and (4, 4) are very close to the enemy. The enemy is likely to move DOWN towards (4, 5). If I move DOWN to (5, 8), I am not in immediate danger from the enemy's current position, but if the enemy moves UP (unlikely given the apple cluster below), we could collide. The greater risk is that the enemy might chase the apples on the x=4 column, and moving DOWN puts me closer to that column. Given the enemy is at y=6 and the closest apple is at y=5, the enemy will almost certainly move DOWN.\n*   **RIGHT:** (6, 9) -> Currently empty. This moves me away from the enemy snake and the apple cluster. It is the safest option to avoid any collision this turn.\n\n**3. Risk Assessment:**\nThe enemy snake is on the same x-axis (x=4) as the apples. It is highly probable that the enemy will continue moving DOWN to eat the apples. If I move DOWN to (5, 8), I am positioned (5,8) while the enemy is at (4,6). There is a low immediate risk of head-on collision, but it keeps me close to the \"danger zone\". If I move RIGHT to (6, 9), I put maximum distance between myself and the enemy. Since survival is the priority, moving away from the area the enemy is likely to traverse is the wisest choice.\n\n**4. Strategy:**\n*   **Short Term:** Move RIGHT to (6, 9) to ensure safety this turn. The enemy is busy eating the apples on the left side of the board.\n*   **Long Term:** Wait for the enemy to clear the apples at x=4 or move further away. Once the coast is clear, I can maneuver towards the apples at (8, 8) or sweep down the board to find other food.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving RIGHT guarantees I do not hit the board edge or my own body, and it maximizes distance from the enemy. Moving DOWN is risky because it keeps me near the enemy's trajectory.\n\nRIGHT",

Strategic Decision:**\n- **Target:** The apple at (8, 8) is adjacent. Moving RIGHT is the priority to gain a point and grow, maintaining momentum.\n- **Safety Check:**\n    - **Direct Collision:** RIGHT to (8, 8) is an apple, not a snake body.\n    - **Head-on Collision:** Enemy Snake #0 is at (4, 3). Its potential moves this turn are:\n        - UP to (4, 4) -> Hits its own body (segment at (4,4)) -> Enemy dies.\n        - DOWN to (4, 2) -> There is an apple at (4, 2). Likely move.\n        - LEFT to (3, 3) -> Empty.\n        - RIGHT to (5, 3) -> Empty.\n    - The enemy is very far away (distance of ~5-6 moves). There is no scenario where the enemy head reaches (8, 8) this turn.\n    - **Future Trapping:** Moving RIGHT to (8, 8) places me near the top-right corner. While corners are usually risky, eating the apple this turn increases my score and length. Next turn, from (8, 8), I can move DOWN (towards (8, 4)) or LEFT (back to (7, 8)), or UP (to (8, 9)). I will not be immediately trapped.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving RIGHT to (8, 8) is safe, maximizes points for this turn, and sets up a path towards the next closest apples in the top-right quadrant (like (9, 3) or (8, 4)).\n\nRight",

Since my body is at (7, 9) and (7, 8), this is safe. This moves me into the top-right corner.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 7):** The board shows (8, 7) has an Apple ('A'). This is safe and I grow.\n3.  **LEFT (7, 8):** My body is currently at (7, 8). Moving here would cause self-collision -> **Death**.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 8):** The board shows (9, 8) is Empty. This is safe and moves me to the right wall.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n- **Avoiding Left/Backwards:** Left is death.\n- **Avoiding Up (Cornering):** Moving UP to (8, 9) puts my head in the top-right corner (x=9, y=9). From there, my only exits would be DOWN (back to 8,8) or LEFT (7,9). However, 7,9 is currently occupied by my tail (though the tail moves next turn, moving into a corner restricts maneuverability significantly). Given the goal is to survive for 150 turns, corners are dangerous traps.\n- **Choosing between Down and Right:**\n    - **Down (8, 7):** Targets the apple at (8, 7). It's good to eat apples, but it moves me closer to the bottom wall and might limit upward options later.\n    - **Right (9, 8):** Targets the open space at the right wall. It keeps me on the \"edge\" of the board but leaves two directions (Down and Up) open for the next turn. It also aligns me with the apple at (9, 3) for future turns.\n- **Enemy Check:** Enemy at (4, 2) is far away. No risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **UP** is too risky (corner). Moving **LEFT** is suicide. **DOWN** is a valid move to eat an apple. **RIGHT** is a valid move to maintain positioning and avoid the corner. To maximize future flexibility (avoiding the trap at 8,9), **RIGHT** is the safest strategic choice for long-term survival, even though it delays eating the specific apple at (8,7). It positions me to access the (9,3) apple later.\n\nFinal Choice: **RIGHT**\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 7):** Occupied by my own body (segment). **Death.**\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n- I am currently at (8, 7).\n- **Available Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n- **Goal:** Eat apples while maintaining safety.\n- **Path Analysis:**\n    - **LEFT (7, 7):** Moves toward the center and hits the apple at (7, 7). This is highly desirable. It also opens paths to the cluster at (8,4) and (3,4).\n    - **UP (8, 8):** Moves along the top wall. This is safe but isolates me from the immediate apple cluster. It would require a long detour to get back to the bottom center apples.\n    - **DOWN (8, 6):** Moves down. Safe, but skips the immediate apple at (7,7) and moves away from the wall. However, considering the layout, moving LEFT puts me in a position to potentially trap Snake #0 or access more apples efficiently.\n- **Enemy Interaction:** Snake #0 is at (5, 4) heading into a cluster of apples. They are growing. I need to move efficiently.\n- **Constraint Check:** \"All moves and plans must be extremely concise.\" \"Only explain the immediate next move.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**LEFT** is the optimal move. It captures the apple at (7, 7) and positions the snake centrally to pursue the remaining apples.\n\nLEFT",

Length = 4.\n- **Previous Move:** I moved LEFT from (8, 7) to (7, 7), eating the apple. The tail will move, clearing (8, 7).\n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (6, 4). Body covers (5, 4) through (4, 5) and (5, 3). This snake is hunting the apples at (6, 3) and (8, 4).\n- **Apples:** (8, 4), (9, 3), (3, 4), (6, 3) remain.\n\n**Board Safety Check (from perspective of Head at (7, 7)):**\n1.  **UP (7, 8):** Empty. Safe.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 6):** Empty. Safe.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 7):** Empty. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 7):** Currently occupied by my own body (segment). However, because I just moved LEFT, my tail (currently at (9, 8)) will move forward to (9, 7). This vacates (8, 7) *simultaneously* as I move. **Safe.**\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n- **Available Moves:** All directions are safe.\n- **Goal:** Intercept Snake #0 and claim the remaining apples.\n- **Path Analysis:**\n    - **RIGHT (8, 7):** This is the critical move. It retraces my previous path but positions me directly above the apple at (8, 4). From (8, 7), I can drop down to (8, 6), (8, 5), and (8, 4).\n    - **Enemy Threat:** Snake #0 is at (6, 4). To get to (8, 4), it must travel East 2 steps. I am currently at (7, 7). To get to (8, 4), I must travel South 3 steps.\n    - **Timing:** Snake #0 is likely to move Right to (7, 4) or Up/Down to eat. If it moves Right, it will be at (7, 4). I can move Down to (7, 6), then (7, 5), then (7, 4) to cut it off. If it moves to (8, 4), I can chase.\n    - **Controlling the Right Side:** By moving RIGHT to (8, 7), I control the vertical column x=8 and can reach the apple at (9, 3) easily as well. If I move LEFT or DOWN, I cede the (8, 4) and (9, 3) apples to the enemy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**RIGHT** is the optimal move. It maintains my position on the right side of the board, puts me in a direct line to intercept the enemy snake (Snake #0) as it approaches the apple cluster at (8, 4), and keeps the apple at (9, 3) within reach. It utilizes the fact that my tail is clearing (8, 7) this turn.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",
