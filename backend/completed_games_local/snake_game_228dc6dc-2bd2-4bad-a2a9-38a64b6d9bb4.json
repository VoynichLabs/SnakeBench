This will give me my first apple and start growing my snake. The enemy snake is at (3, 2), which is far from my position, so there's no immediate collision risk.\n\nLong-term strategy note: I should focus on collecting apples while maintaining flexibility in movement.

This move keeps me safe from immediate collision with the enemy snake (assuming they don't move RIGHT into my position) and maintains an open path toward the apple.\n\nLong-term strategy: I should continue moving toward the apple at (5, 7), which is directly above me. After collecting that apple, I'll need to reassess the board for the next closest apple while being mindful of the enemy snake's position and potential moves.

I have no body yet, since I have not collected any apples.\n- **Enemy snake #0**: Head at (5, 5), body at [(6, 5), (7, 5)]. It has 2 apples already, so it's bigger and more dangerous. Its head is right next to mine.\n\n- **Immediate danger analysis**:\n  - **UP** (to (4, 6)): Safe \u2014 no wall, no body.\n  - **DOWN** (to (4, 4)): Safe \u2014 no wall, no body.\n  - **LEFT** (to (3, 5)): Safe \u2014 no wall, no body.\n  - **RIGHT** (to (5, 5)): Dangerous \u2014 collides head-on with enemy snake #0. **Eliminate**.\n\nSo LEFT, UP, and DOWN are safe. RIGHT is a guaranteed death move.\n\n- **Apple positions**:\n  - Nearest apples: (5, 7), (0, 5), (8, 7), (1, 2)\n  - The apple at (5, 7) looks promising \u2014 it's only 2 steps up and 1 step right from me.\n  - The apple at (0, 5) is on the same horizontal level as me, but far left.\n\n- **Strategic choices**:\n  - If I go UP, I get closer to the apple at (5, 7).\n  - If I go LEFT, I distance myself from the enemy and move toward the center-left area of the board. That also keeps my options open.\n  - DOWN just moves me away from apples into less useful space, but it\u2019s safe.\n\n- **Avoiding the enemy**:\n  - Snake #0 is currently moving along the horizontal line at y=5, heading right. If it continues right (to (6,5)), it will move away from me. But even if it goes UP or DOWN from (5,5), I should avoid RIGHT (which is toward it) and possibly UP if I expect it to also go UP.\n\n- **Decision**:\n  - RIGHT is death. Eliminated.\n  - UP seems like a good idea to get closer to an apple, but I must consider if enemy #0 might also go UP. Since its head is just to my right and it's moving, moving UP could risk a head-on collision if it also moves UP.\n  - However, since movement is simultaneous and the snake might not go UP necessarily, **UP** is a calculated risk **but** not immediately obvious death, and it improves my position.\n\n  Let me reconsider: the snake\u2019s body is to the right of its head \u2014 it can\u2019t go LEFT (that would be into its own body). So likely it will go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Any of those directions puts it in a different row than me if it goes UP/DOWN. If it goes RIGHT, it moves further away. So it is less likely to move into (5,6) \u2014 possible, but not certain.\n\n  On balance, **UP** still looks the best \u2014 keeps me safe, gets me closer to an apple, and keeps future moves open.\n\n---\n\n### Future plan note to self:\nMove UP now to get closer to apple at (5,7). Avoid moving RIGHT at all costs due to enemy head proximity. Watch next turn for enemy movement.\n\nUP",

UP (to (4, 8))\n\n- **Safety Check:**\n  - Position (4, 8): Is it on the board? Yes.\n  - Is there a body segment? No, my body is empty and the enemy's body is not at (4, 8).\n- **Feasibility:** Safe.\n\n#### 2. DOWN (to (4, 6))\n\n- **Safety Check:**\n  - Position (4, 6): Is it on the board? Yes.\n  - Is there a body segment? The enemy snake's body is at (5, 6). Is (4, 6) occupied by a body? No.\n- **Feasibility:** Safe.\n\n#### 3. LEFT (to (3, 7))\n\n- **Safety Check:**\n  - Position (3, 7): Is it on the board? Yes.\n  - Is there a body segment? No.\n- **Feasibility:** Safe.\n\n#### 4. RIGHT (to (5, 7))\n\n- **Safety Check:**\n  - Position (5, 7): Is it on the board? Yes.\n  - Is there a body segment? Yes, the enemy snake's body is at (5, 7).\n- **Feasibility:** **Unsafe. Collision with enemy body. Eliminate.**\n\n#### Safe Move Evaluation (UP, DOWN, LEFT)\n\nAmong the safe moves, I need to consider future options and apple proximity.\n\n- **UP (4, 8):**\n  - Moves me further from the nearest apples and closer to the top edge. Fewer future moves.\n  - The tile above (4, 8) is (4, 9), which is on the board and empty. That\u2019s one potential follow-up.\n  - Apple at (1, 9) is in the upper part of the board, so moving up isn\u2019t entirely counterproductive long-term.\n\n- **DOWN (4, 6):**\n  - Moves me closer to multiple apples: (0, 5), (1, 2), (0, 3).\n  - The tile below (4, 6) is (4, 5), which is empty. This path seems to keep more options open.\n  - Avoids the area where the long enemy snake body is concentrated at Y=7.\n\n- **LEFT (3, 7):**\n  - Moves me away from the central apples.\n  - Tile (2, 7) is clear. A valid option, but maybe not as strategic as DOWN for reaching apples.\n\nComparing the three safe options, **DOWN** seems to be the best. It moves me toward areas with more apples and keeps the board open for future movement, unlike moving UP which pushes me toward a wall.\n\n### Short Plan for Next Turn\n\n- Move DOWN to get closer to apples at (0, 5) and (1, 2).\n- This also moves away from the enemy's head, reducing risk.\n- Focus on the apple at (1, 2) as the primary target for the next few turns.\n\nDOWN",

I have no body yet, as I haven't collected any apples.\n\n**Apples in Play**:\n- (1, 9) \u2014 Far away and near the edge. Risky to chase.\n- (0, 5) \u2014 On the left side, two rows above me.\n- (1, 2) \u2014 Below and to the left.\n- (0, 3) \u2014 Directly below and to the left.\n- (6, 8) \u2014 Above and to the right, near the enemy snake's vicinity.\n\n**Enemy Snake (#0)**:\n- Head at (7, 4).\n- Body extends leftward and upward from there: [(8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7)].\n- This means row 4 is contested on the right side by the enemy head, and much of the upper-right quadrant is blocked or dangerous.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluating Moves from (4, 4)\n\n#### 1. **UP** \u2013 Moving to (4, 5)\n- **Safety**: Safe for now. No immediate body collision or off-board risk.\n- **Future Moves**: Keeps options open above and to both sides.\n- **Strategy**: Moves me away from the dangerous right side where enemy snake is and lets me consider upper apples later.\n- **Rating**: High safety, good flexibility.\n\n#### 2. **DOWN** \u2013 Moving to (4, 3)\n- **Safety**: Also safe.\n- **Future Moves**: Moves me closer to apples (0, 3) and (1, 2).\n- **Strategy**: Direct path to lower apples, but might lead to cornering myself against the bottom edge later.\n- **Rating**: Lower flexibility than UP; useful short term.\n\n#### 3. **LEFT** \u2013 Moving to (3, 4)\n- **Safety**: Safe for now.\n- **Future Moves**: Potential to head towards apples at x=0 column.\n- **Strategy**: Reasonable but slower and limits vertical movement early.\n- **Rating**: Medium safety, low-medium long-term value.\n\n#### 4. **RIGHT** \u2013 Moving to (5, 4)\n- **Safety**: DANGEROUS!\n- There\u2019s a high chance the enemy snake at (7, 4) could also move left and collide with me here or nearby.\n- Risk of head-on collision.\n- **Rating**: Unsafe due to proximity of enemy snake head. Eliminate.\n\n---\n\n### Best Choice\n\n**Preferred Option**: UP\n- Keeps me centrally safe vertically.\n- Avoids confrontation with the bigger snake (#0).\n- Preserves maximum flexibility.\n- Maintains access to central and upper regions of map.\n\nI should continue building space around my head before committing to chase specific apples.\n\n**Short Plan for Next Turn**:\nAvoid getting boxed in vertically and start moving left on the next turn to approach the apples along the left side safely if possible.\n\nUP",

The apple at (0, 5) is on the same row as my head, making it a potentially reachable target.\n\nMoving LEFT toward (1, 5) keeps me away from the enemy snake while positioning me to potentially collect apples on the left side of the board.

It could move:\n- UP to (4, 6) - but that's where my head would be if I go UP, leading to a head-on collision\n- DOWN to (4, 4)\n- LEFT to (3, 5)\n- RIGHT to (5, 5) - but that's where its own body segment is\n\nThe most dangerous scenario would be if I move UP to (1, 8) and the enemy moves UP to (4, 6), but that's not a collision.\n\nActually, I need to be more careful. Let me recheck the board:\n- My head is at (1, 7)\n- Enemy head is at (4, 5)\n\nIf I move UP to (1, 8), that's safe from immediate collision with enemy.\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 6), that's backward movement which is generally problematic.\n\nWait, I misread my position. Looking at the board again:\nMy snake (ID 1) head is at (1, 7) - yes, that's correct.\nThe board shows my head at (1, 7).\n\nLet me reconsider the apple at (1, 9) - that's 2 spaces above me.\nUP to (1, 8) looks good strategically.\n\nBut I also need to consider that the enemy snake at (4, 5) might move toward the same vertical corridor.\n\nActually, let me check if I've misread anything. The last move said my head was at (1, 6), now it's at (1, 7). So I did move UP last time.\n\nGiven that I moved UP last time, moving UP again would be continuing in the same direction, toward the apple at (1, 9).\n\nThe enemy snake at (4, 5) with a long body to the right and up could be trying to box me in or contest the upper area.\n\nIf I go UP to (1, 8), I'm getting closer to the apple at (1, 9) and maintaining mobility.\nI'll have future options to go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT from (1, 8).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 7), I'm heading toward apples at x=0 but getting closer to the wall.\n\nRIGHT to (2, 7) moves me away from immediate apples but increases options.\n\nStrategically, moving UP toward (1, 9) seems best. It's a clear path with multiple future options.\n\nPlan: Continue moving toward the apple at (1, 9) while monitoring enemy snake movements. Keep mobile and avoid getting cornered.\n\nUP",

The risk of a head-on collision with the enemy snake is low with my current position and the available moves for the opponent.\n\nPlan: Get the apple at (1, 9) immediately, which will give me a score and increase my length to 1.

The enemy snake at (0, 9) is far away and doesn't pose an immediate threat.\n\nAfter collecting this apple, I'll need to plan my next moves to target other apples like (1, 2), (0, 3), (7, 1), or (6, 9).\n\nLEFT\nLEFT",
