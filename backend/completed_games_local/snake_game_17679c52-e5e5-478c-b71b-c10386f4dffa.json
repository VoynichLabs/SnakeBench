(2,2) is far down. (3,3) is 1 right, 5 down. (8,1) far. (8,2) far.  \nI want to avoid moving directly toward enemy head unless necessary\u2014enemy at (7,1) far away.  \n\nBest short-term: go toward (4,7) or (3,3) but (4,7) is closer in Manhattan distance: |4-2|+|7-8| = 2+1=3.  \nTo get to (4,7), I could go RIGHT to (3,8) or DOWN to (2,7).  \nFrom (3,8), next turn could go DOWN to (3,7) then RIGHT to (4,7).  \nFrom (2,7), next turn could go RIGHT to (3,7) then RIGHT to (4,7).

Not this turn.  \n\n**Safety check:** If I go DOWN to (3,6), enemy could go UP to (6,3), moving toward same apple region. Next turn, if I go DOWN again to (3,5), enemy could go LEFT to (5,2) or UP to (6,4). Still safe distance.  \n\nBetter to start moving toward apple now. DOWN is direct path to (3,3). LEFT or UP take me away from it.  \n\n**Decision:** DOWN toward (3,3).  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move toward (3,3) while checking enemy\u2019s possible moves to avoid collision.

If enemy goes LEFT to (8,6), then next turn it could go toward (7,4) \u2014 but still far enough (3 steps away horizontally).  \n\n**Decision:**  \n- UP (3,5) keeps central position, moves toward (2,9) and (1,7).  \n- RIGHT (4,4) moves toward (7,4).  \nSince (7,4) is closer in Manhattan distance from (3,4) than (2,9), and RIGHT also gives good future options, I\u2019ll go RIGHT now to get closer to that apple.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (4,4), next turn consider UP toward (4,5) to approach (7,4) via a path that avoids trapping myself. Keep enemy\u2019s possible path to (7,4) in mind \u2014 but enemy is far and slow.  \n\nRIGHT",

No overlap \u2192 no immediate head-on.\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n- (7,4) is 2 steps RIGHT from (5,4) if I go RIGHT now then RIGHT next turn.  \n- (1,7) is 3 steps UP and 3 LEFT from (4,4).  \n- (2,9) is 5 steps UP and 2 LEFT.  \n- (9,2) far.  \n- (9,0) far.\n\nClosest is (7,4) if I go RIGHT now.\n\n**Future safety after each safe move:**  \n1.

If it goes LEFT, it could be heading toward (7,4) via (7,5) etc. But I\u2019m closer: from (5,4) to (7,4) is 2 steps; enemy from (8,5) to (7,4) is 2 steps as well (LEFT then DOWN). So if we both move optimally, we could meet at (7,4) on turn 22 \u2014 but enemy might not go exactly that way. Still, risk exists.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now, next turn I\u2019ll be at (5,4) and apple at (7,4). Enemy could be at (8,5) or (9,4). If enemy at (8,5), then possible head-on at (7,4) if we both go toward it. Safer to perhaps go UP now to approach (1,7) or (2,9) instead.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is near bottom-right apples (9,2), (9,0). I can let it have those and focus on top-left apples (1,7), (2,9). That keeps me away from enemy and avoids head-on risk.\n\nUP moves me toward (1,7) and (2,9) safely. From (4,5), next turn I can go UP again toward (4,6) etc.\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP to (4,5) to target top apples and avoid potential head-on over (7,4).\n\nRIGHT",

I can collect the apple at (9, 2), bringing me to 6 apples and tying with the enemy. The path forward is still clear:\n- Turn 23: DOWN to (9, 2) \u2192 collect apple \u2192 6 apples\n- Turn 24: DOWN to (9, 1) \u2192 prepare for next apple\n- Turn 25: DOWN to (9, 0) \u2192 collect apple \u2192 7 apples (take lead!)\n\nThis continues my efficient strategy of collecting the right-edge apples. The enemy is still at (6, 4), far away and not threatening this path. LEFT would abandon a guaranteed apple collection opportunity with no strategic advantage.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nContinue DOWN to collect both remaining right-edge apples at (9, 2) and (9, 0). This will put me at 7 apples and ahead of the enemy. After that, reassess board position and either pursue (7, 4) or rotate toward left-side apples (2, 9) and (1, 7) depending on safety.\n\nDOWN",

I should avoid immediate adjacency. After this move, aim for (2,9) or (1,7) apples via left/up moves, staying clear of enemy path.

DOWN this turn to (9, 0) \u2192 collect apple \u2192 reach 7 apples (tied with enemy)\n2. After that, pivot LEFT toward the cluster of apples on the left side: (1, 7), (3, 7), (2, 9)\n3.

This means next turn UP is blocked by my own body, LEFT blocked by body, so only DOWN and RIGHT possible. Could be risky if enemy moves near.  \n\n3. **RIGHT to (8,5):**  \n   - From (8,5): UP (8,6) empty, DOWN (8,4) empty, LEFT (7,5) my body (dead next turn), RIGHT (9,5) empty \u2192 3 safe next moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n- (7,4) is directly DOWN from me now. Eating it gives a point but reduces next-turn options.  \n- (2,9), (1,7), (3,7) are far.  \n- (9,0) is near enemy\u2019s possible move DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**Risk vs reward:**  \nI have apple lead 7 vs 6. I don\u2019t need to rush into a risky eat that limits future mobility.  \n\nEnemy is at (9,1) and might go to (8,1) or (9,0). If enemy goes to (9,0), it will eat apple there and grow, but its body will extend to (9,1).  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (7,4) and enemy goes LEFT to (8,1), next turn enemy could move to (8,2) or (8,0) or (7,1), not immediately threatening me. Still, my limited moves after eating could allow it to cut me off later.  \n\nUP keeps me central and safe, but delays apple.  \nRIGHT moves me toward right side but keeps options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nEnemy likely will eat (9,0) apple if it goes DOWN. That will extend its tail at (9,1). My goal should be to target (3,7) or (1,7) apples next, using open central area. Avoid being near enemy's possible path toward top-left apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nDOWN gives immediate apple but reduces next-turn safe moves to 2. UP or RIGHT give 3 safe moves next turn. Since I have an apple lead, prioritize safety and flexibility.  \n\nBetween UP and RIGHT:  \n- UP (7,6) keeps me away from enemy.  \n- RIGHT (8,5) moves closer to enemy's possible location (8,1) but still safe.  \n\nBetter to go **UP** for now, maintain flexibility, and plan route to (3,7) or (1,7) next turn.  \n\nUP",

Either way, it\u2019s moving away from top apples for now, but could start moving up the left side eventually.  \n\n---\n\n**Strategic thoughts:**  \nEating (8, 7) now puts me at length 9, enemy at length 8, giving me a lead. However, after eating, my body will occupy (7, 7) next turn, which blocks my LEFT from (8, 7). That\u2019s okay because I\u2019d still have 3 safe moves from (8, 7) after eating.  \n\nLEFT to (6, 7) keeps me flexible and moves toward (3, 7) apple, but delays taking the (8, 7) apple \u2014 enemy could potentially get it later if it circles up.  \n\nUP to (7, 8) avoids apple but keeps options open \u2014 maybe too passive when an apple is adjacent.  \n\nGiven scores are tied at 7 apples, taking the apple now gives me the lead and doesn\u2019t trap me.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT to (8, 7) to eat apple, gain length lead, and maintain 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nPlan for next turn: From (8, 7), assess enemy\u2019s new position and likely head toward top-left apples or move upward to avoid being boxed in.  \n\nRIGHT",

The upper-left cluster has three apples within reasonable distance. Plan to navigate toward that region (heading generally left and up) while monitoring enemy position. Stay alert for any blocking by the enemy snake.\n\nUP",

The enemy head is at (4, 8), which is northwest. After the enemy moves, it could move in various directions.\n- LEFT (5, 4): Also moves toward apples, gets me closer to (4, 7).\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (4, 8) and body extending down the right side of the board, the enemy is currently focused on a different area. Moving UP to (6, 5) allows me to get closer to the apple cluster at (2, 9), (1, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7) while maintaining access to safe squares. This is a direct path toward multiple apples.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nContinue moving northwest toward the apple cluster. My priority is (4, 7), (3, 7), and (2, 9). The enemy is tied with me at 8 apples, so I need to secure apples before they do. The left side of the board has more apples clustered together. Keep moving UP and then LEFT to reach them efficiently. Avoid the enemy's expanding body on the right side.\n\nUP",

Let me check current enemy body: head (3, 7), body [(4, 7), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5)].

This is the closest apple. After eating (2, 5), I could continue to (1, 5) (1 cell away) and then pivot to (1, 7). This path is efficient and keeps me ahead of my tail.\n\n- **UP (5, 6):** Moves toward upper apples but takes me away from the closest apple at (2, 5). Less efficient scoring path.\n\n- **DOWN (5, 4):** Moves downward, away from most apples. Inefficient.\n\n**Strategic reasoning:**\nI'm down 8-10 on apples. I need to gain ground urgently. The apple at (2, 5) is directly west on my current y-level and is reachable within 2-3 moves. This is my best immediate opportunity. LEFT is the clear choice to start pursuing this apple efficiently.\n\nThe enemy is currently occupying the upper-right region of the board, so there's less collision risk as I move west.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Continue LEFT toward (2, 5)\n- After consuming (2, 5), move to (1, 5)\n- Then pivot to consume (1, 7) and work through the western apple cluster\n- Maintain distance from enemy while securing quick wins\n\nLEFT",

If I go LEFT now, I can\u2019t get them soon without looping around. If I go RIGHT now, I can possibly get them in a few moves if path clears.  \nBut enemy is far from those apples for now.\n\n---\n\n**Risk of being trapped:**  \nFrom (1, 9) next turn, only LEFT to (0, 9). Then from (0, 9):  \n- UP off \u274c  \n- DOWN (0, 8) my body \u274c  \n- LEFT off \u274c  \n- RIGHT (1, 9) my neck \u274c  \nThat\u2019s 0 safe moves \u2192 death in 2 turns if I go LEFT now and then LEFT again.  \nSo I must not go LEFT twice in a row. Actually, from (0, 9) I\u2019d be dead next turn unless my tail moves away from (0, 8) by then. Let\u2019s check tail movement: my tail is at (5, 8) now. It will move forward each turn as I don\u2019t eat apple. In 2 turns, tail will be at (4, 8) maybe? Wait, body list is head-to-tail: tail is last coordinate (5, 8). When I move without eating, tail moves off (5, 8), so in 2 turns, (0, 8) might still be occupied because body shifts slowly? Let\u2019s trace:  \nCurrent body after moving without apple: new head at (1, 9), remove tail (5, 8), so (0, 8) remains occupied.  \nIn 2 turns from now, (0, 8) still occupied unless tail passes it, which takes many moves.  \nSo going LEFT to (1, 9) then LEFT to (0, 9) is deadly in 2 turns unless I eat an apple before then to avoid moving tail.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nGoing LEFT now leads to a potential trap unless I can eat apple at (5, 9) or (6, 9) soon, but path is blocked by my own body.  \nGoing RIGHT now leads to (3, 9) \u2192 (4, 9) \u2192 (5, 9) apple in 3 moves if tail clears (5, 8) by then. Actually, apple at (5, 9) is above (5, 8), so from (4, 9) I can go RIGHT to (5, 9) only if (5, 8) is empty then. That\u2019s possible if tail moves off (5, 8) in 2 turns.\n\nBetter to go RIGHT now to stay near top-row apples and hope tail movement opens path.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (3, 9), go RIGHT to (4, 9) next turn, then if (5, 8) is clear, go to (5, 9) for apple. If not, maybe go DOWN from (4, 9) later if possible. Avoid getting stuck on top row.\n\nRIGHT",

No head-on risk for me because I\u2019m far away.\n\n---\n\n**Consider each safe move for me:**\n\n**RIGHT to (5, 9)**:  \n- Eat apple \u2192 grow by 1, length becomes 14.  \n- Next turn from (5, 9): possible moves: UP off board \u274c, DOWN (5, 8) empty now but after growth tail stays at (4, 7), so (5, 8) free \u2705, LEFT (4, 9) my neck \u274c, RIGHT (6, 9) apple \u2705. So two moves possible next turn.  \n- Risk: top row is limited (only y=9), but I can go DOWN next turn to (5, 8) into more space.  \n\n**DOWN to (4, 8)**:  \n- No apple eaten, so tail moves forward (tail currently at (4, 7) \u2192 moves to (3, 7)? Wait, my body order: head moves, each segment follows previous segment\u2019s old position. Tail moves to old position of second-to-last segment: (3, 7) becomes tail? Let\u2019s check:  \nCurrent body: head (4, 9), then (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7) tail.  \nIf I move DOWN to (4, 8), new head (4, 8), then old head (4, 9) becomes segment 2, (3, 9) becomes segment 3, etc., last segment (tail) (4, 7) disappears, new tail is old (3, 7)? Actually:  \nNew body: [(4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7)] \u2192 tail at (3, 7).  \nSo (4, 8) becomes head, (4, 9) behind it, tail at (3, 7).  \nFrom (4, 8) next turn: UP (4, 9) my body \u274c, DOWN (4, 7) empty \u2705, LEFT (3, 8) empty \u2705, RIGHT (5, 8) empty \u2705. That\u2019s 3 options. More freedom.  \n\n---\n\n**Comparing**:  \nRIGHT \u2192 eat apple, but next turn only 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT) from (5, 9).  \nDOWN \u2192 no apple, but next turn from (4, 8) have 3 safe moves, more options, can then go for apple at (5, 9) or (6, 9) later.  \n\nGiven I\u2019m tied in apples with enemy (both 12), I don\u2019t need to rush eating if it restricts future moves. Keeping flexibility is good. Also, enemy might eat (2, 0) apple, but that\u2019s fine.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn**:  \nIf I go DOWN now, next turn from (4, 8) I can go RIGHT to (5, 8) or LEFT to (3, 8) to maneuver toward apples while keeping space.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice**:  \nDOWN gives more options next turn, avoids being trapped on top row.  \n\nDOWN",

Wait \u2014 my body currently has (4, 9), (3, 9) etc., but (5, 9) is apple now. If I eat (6, 9), my neck is (6, 8), so LEFT (5, 9) becomes my new head position next turn if I go there, and it will be apple now, but after I eat (6, 9) this turn, apple (5, 9) remains unless enemy eats it. Actually, board shows (5, 9) is apple now, and (6, 9) is apple. Eating (6, 9) leaves (5, 9) still there.  \nSo next turn from (6, 9): DOWN blocked by neck, UP off board, LEFT (5, 9) empty (apple), RIGHT (7, 9) empty. So 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT). Better than last turn\u2019s prediction because neck is at (6, 8), not (5, 8). Still somewhat constrained.  \n\n**DOWN to (6, 7):**  \n- No apple eaten.  \n- Next turn from (6, 7): UP (6, 8) empty \u2705, DOWN (6, 6) empty \u2705, LEFT (5, 7) empty \u2705, RIGHT (7, 7) empty \u2705 \u2192 4 options.  \n- Moves away from top apples but keeps flexibility.  \n\n**RIGHT to (7, 8):**  \n- No apple eaten.  \n- Next turn from (7, 8): UP (7, 9) empty \u2705, DOWN (7, 7) empty \u2705, LEFT (6, 8) empty \u2705, RIGHT (8, 8) empty \u2705 \u2192 4 options.  \n- Moves toward right side, away from enemy, but also away from apples (6, 9) and (5, 9).  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019m 1 apple behind. Eating (6, 9) now ties score and gives me length advantage. Enemy is far at (2, 2) and can\u2019t reach (6, 9) in one turn.  \nAfter eating (6, 9), I\u2019ll have two safe moves next turn (LEFT to (5, 9) apple, RIGHT to (7, 9) empty). That\u2019s acceptable risk.  \nIf I go DOWN or RIGHT now, enemy might move up toward apples and take (5, 9) or (6, 9) before I can.  \n\nBest to secure apple now while it\u2019s safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP to (6, 9) to eat apple and tie score, while still having options next turn.  \n\nUP",

Next turn from (5, 9) only RIGHT (6, 9) is safe \u2014 but (6, 9) will be my neck now, so moving there would be hitting myself? Wait, no: my neck is at (6, 9) after this turn, but if I move RIGHT from (5, 9) to (6, 9), that\u2019s into my own body segment (neck) \u2192 death. So actually **RIGHT is not safe next turn** \u2014 it\u2019s my neck! That means after eating (5, 9), I have **zero safe moves** next turn. That\u2019s fatal.  \n\nSo **LEFT is suicidal** after growth. Must avoid.  \n\n---\n\n**Therefore only RIGHT is viable.**  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**  \nMove RIGHT to (7, 9) now. Next turn from (7, 9), I\u2019ll have DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT safe. Possibly go DOWN toward (7, 2) apple later, or LEFT to reclaim (6, 9) area.

Wait \u2014 check: (5, 9) is free? Board shows at (5, 9) is 'A'? Yes, apple at (5, 9). My body at (4, 9), (6, 9), etc., but (5, 9) is free. But to get there from (7, 8), I\u2019d need to go LEFT twice, but first LEFT is into my body at (6, 8). So can\u2019t reach (5, 9) directly now.  \n\nActually, looking at board:  \nRow 9: . . T T T A T T . .  \nSo (5, 9) is apple, (4, 9) and (6, 9) are my body, so (5, 9) is accessible only from (5, 8) or (5, 10) off-board or (4, 9) or (6, 9). But (5, 8) is my body too. So (5, 9) is surrounded by my body except possibly from (4, 9) or (6, 9), but those are my body cells. Wait \u2014 I\u2019m confused:  \nMy body: (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9), ...  \nSo (5, 9) has neighbors: (5, 8) my body, (4, 9) my body, (6, 9) my body, (5, 10) off-board. So apple (5, 9) is completely trapped inside my body loop! That means I can eat it later by moving into it when my tail moves away. Currently tail is at (0, 6), far. So (5, 9) is safe for later.  \n\nBetter to go toward (5, 7) or (7, 2) or (9, 3).  \n\n---\n\n**Risk of head-on collision:**  \nEnemy at (5, 2) might move UP/RIGHT/DOWN. No overlap with my possible moves. Safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Choice:**  \nDOWN to (7, 7) seems good \u2014 opens path to (7, 2) apple and (5, 7) apple, keeps me central, 4 safe moves next turn.  \nRIGHT to (8, 8) also fine but pushes me to right edge sooner, though still safe.  \n\nI\u2019ll go DOWN to stay more flexible and move toward lower apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 7), consider moving LEFT toward (6, 7) to eventually target (5, 7) apple, but check enemy position then.

Yes, body list length is 13, plus head = 14 total.\n\n**Apples**: (5, 9), (9, 3), (5, 7), (9, 1), (6, 4)\n\n**Enemy snake #0**  \nHead: (7, 2)  \nBody: [(6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)]  \nLength: 15 body + head = 16 cells (apples: 15).\n\n---\n\n**Possible moves from my head (6, 7):**\n\n- UP (6, 8): my body \u274c  \n- DOWN (6, 6): empty \u2705  \n- LEFT (5, 7): apple \u2705  \n- RIGHT (7, 7): my body \u274c (my body segment at (7, 7) is right behind my head \u2014 moving right would be suicide)  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy possible moves from (7, 2):**\n\n- UP (7, 3): empty \u2705  \n- DOWN (7, 1): empty \u2705  \n- LEFT (6, 2): enemy body \u274c  \n- RIGHT (8, 2): empty \u2705  \n\nAll three are safe for enemy except LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**Immediate risks**:  \nIf enemy moves UP/DOWN/RIGHT, no direct head-on collision with my possible moves (DOWN to (6, 6), LEFT to (5, 7)).  \nBut enemy could move RIGHT to (8, 2), then next turn could threaten if I go far right later. Not immediate issue.\n\n---\n\n**Apple targeting**:  \nClosest apple is (5, 7) \u2014 one step LEFT. Eating it would tie apples with enemy at 14 each, and grow me by 1 segment, making me length 15 (still shorter than enemy\u2019s 16).  \n\nAlso apple at (6, 4) is reachable via DOWN then more DOWN/LEFT later.  \nApple at (5, 9) is above my current loop \u2014 blocked by my body now but will free up as tail moves.\n\n---\n\n**Safety after each move**:\n\n**LEFT to (5, 7)** \u2014 eat apple, new head at (5, 7), body grows by 1.  \nNext turn from (5, 7):  \n- UP (5, 8): my body \u274c (segment (5, 8) is in my body)  \n- DOWN (5, 6): empty \u2705  \n- LEFT (4, 7): empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT (6, 7): empty \u2705 (my old head position will be body now)  \nSo after eating, I\u2019ll have 3 safe moves (UP blocked). Good.\n\n**DOWN to (6, 6)** \u2014 no apple.  \nNext turn from (6, 6):  \n- UP (6, 7): empty \u2705 (old head)  \n- DOWN (6, 5): empty \u2705  \n- LEFT (5, 6): empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT (7, 6): empty \u2705  \nAll 4 moves safe. But I avoid apple this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Longer-term**:  \nIf I take LEFT to eat apple, I\u2019m at (5, 7) next turn, close to apple (6, 4) via DOWN-DOWN-LEFT etc. Enemy is far away at y=2.  \nIf I take DOWN, I\u2019m moving away from immediate apple but gaining more open space. But enemy has more apples and length \u2014 I need to catch up in apples to compete at endgame.\n\nGiven the scoring gap (13 vs 15 apples), eating now is crucial.\n\nAlso, my body blocks UP from (6, 7) now, but after moving LEFT to (5, 7), my body behind me is still long \u2014 but tail at (0, 8) will move next turn to (0, 7) if I grow? Wait, if I eat apple, my tail stays at (0, 8) because growth means tail doesn\u2019t move this turn. So no new space opens immediately.\n\nBut still safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn if I eat apple**:  \nFrom (5, 7), avoid UP into (5, 8), go DOWN toward (5, 6) to approach apple (6, 4) or (9, 3)/(9, 1) later. Keep away from enemy\u2019s possible path upward toward y=3\u20135.\n\n---\n\n**Decision**:  \nLEFT to eat apple (5, 7) is safe and beneficial for score and growth. DOWN is safe but delays eating. Given the apple lead enemy has, I should close the gap.\n\nLEFT",

So path to (4,6) is currently blocked by my own body at (5,5) and (5,6).  \n\nSo (4,6) is not reachable in 1\u20132 turns without hitting myself.  \n\nThus best move is to keep space and aim for future apples.  \n\nRIGHT gives most options next turn (4 exits).  \nUP also okay but fewer exits next turn (3).  \n\nGiven enemy might eat (9,6) this turn, I should avoid moving into its possible path next turn.  \n\nRIGHT seems safest for mobility.  \n\n**Decision:** RIGHT  \n\nRIGHT",

Going LEFT toward (8, 6) then further left is a direct path to valuable apples without much interference risk.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 60: LEFT to (8, 6)\n- Turn 61: Continue LEFT toward (4, 6) apple\n- Turn 62: Collect apple at (4, 6) or nearby\n- Keep pushing for apples while maintaining distance from enemy snake\n\nLEFT",

It advances me toward the closest apple cluster at (4, 6) and (4, 5)\n2. It keeps me away from the enemy head at (7, 5)\n3. It maintains my lead in the score\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 61: LEFT to (7, 6)\n- Turn 62: LEFT to (6, 6)\n- Turn 63: LEFT to (5, 6)\n- Turn 64: DOWN to (5, 5) or continue LEFT to (4, 6) - collect an apple\n- Continue collecting from this cluster, then pivot toward other apples\n\nLEFT",
