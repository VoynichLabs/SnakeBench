My body is currently empty, so I don't have to worry about moving into myself except for moving directly backward into a hypothetical tail segment (which doesn't exist yet).\n\n**My current coordinates:** Head: (5, 7). Length: 1.\n\n**Enemy Snake #0:** Head: (9, 9). Length: 1.\n\n**Apples:** (1, 7), (7, 8), (2, 7), (1, 5), (2, 1), (8, 3), (2, 5), (0, 5), (8, 2), (1, 9), (3, 7), (0, 3), (2, 0), (8, 7), (3, 9).\n\n**Goal:** Move towards an apple, preferably the closest one, while ensuring safety from self-collision (irrelevant now) and collision with Snake #0.\n\n**Potential Moves (S: (5, 7)):**\n\n1.  **UP (5, 8):**\n    *   Safe from boundaries (0-9).\n    *   Safe from my body (empty).\n    *   Enemy head at (9, 9). If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (9, 8), there is no collision. If it moves LEFT to (8, 9), no collision. If it moves UP (off-board, only possible if it were not at max Y) or stays put (not possible), no collision unless it moves to (5, 8). Since Snake #0 is at (9, 9), the only way it hits me at (5, 8) is if it moves UP or LEFT diagonally, which isn't allowed, or if it moves to (5, 8). Since its current location is (9, 9), it cannot reach (5, 8) anyway. This move is safe regarding head-on collision this turn.\n    *   Distance to closest apples:\n        *   (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7) form a nearby cluster to the left/down-left.\n        *   (7, 8) is slightly further right/up.\n        *   (1, 9) is UP.\n        *   Moving to (5, 8) is adjacent to good apple clusters.\n\n2.  **DOWN (5, 6):**\n    *   Safe from boundaries.\n    *   Safe from my body.\n    *   Safe from collision with Snake #0 at (9, 9).\n    *   Moves away from most apples, but (2, 5), (1, 5), (0, 5) are further down.\n\n3.  **LEFT (4, 7):**\n    *   Safe from boundaries.\n    *   Safe from my body.\n    *   Safe from collision with Snake #0 at (9, 9).\n    *   This moves me directly towards the cluster of apples at Y=7: (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7). This looks promising.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 7):**\n    *   Safe from boundaries.\n    *   Safe from my body.\n    *   Safe from collision with Snake #0 at (9, 9).\n    *   Moves me spatially towards (7, 8) but keeps me further from the dense cluster on the left.\n\n**Analyzing Apple Proximity:**\nMy head is at (5, 7).\nClosest apples based on Manhattan distance:\n*   (3, 7): Distance 2 (LEFT, LEFT)\n*   (2, 7): Distance 3\n*   (1, 7): Distance 4\n*   (7, 8): Distance 3 (RIGHT, UP)\n*   (8, 7): Distance 3 (RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT) - Wait, (8, 7) is an apple, not an empty spot. Let's re-check the board visual:\n    Board state at Y=7: `. A A A . 1 . . A .` -> (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7) are apples. (5, 7) is me. (8, 7) is an apple.\n    My Head (5, 7).\n    *   To (3, 7): Distance 2 (LEFT, LEFT)\n    *   To (7, 8): Distance 3 (UP, RIGHT, RIGHT)\n    *   To (8, 7): Distance 3 (RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT)\n\n**Evaluating LEFT (4, 7):**\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 7), the next turn I can aim for (3, 7) easily. This seems like the best path to quickly secure the cluster around Y=7.\n\n**Considering Enemy Movement (Snake #0 at (9, 9)):**\nSnake #0 is currently in the top right corner. It has very few safe moves:\n*   DOWN to (9, 8).\n*   LEFT to (8, 9).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 7):\n*   If S#0 moves DOWN to (9, 8). We are far apart.\n*   If S#0 moves LEFT to (8, 9). We are far apart.\n\nSince the enemy is very far away and I have immediate, safe targets, I should prioritize closing the distance to the apples. Moving LEFT seems optimal for immediate progress towards the (1,7), (2,7), (3,7) apples.\n\n**Long-term thought:** Given the low turn count (0) and the lack of immediate threats, the primary strategy is food acquisition and growth while maintaining spatial freedom. Moving towards the dense cluster on the left side of my current latitude (Y=7) is a good starting move.\n\nMove: LEFT to (4, 7).\n\nShort-term Plan: Move to (4, 7). Next turn, evaluate options to move to (3, 7) to eat the apple there. Check enemy position.\n\nIf I move LEFT: Head is at (4, 7).\nNext turn (Turn 1):\nIf S#0 moves to (9, 8) or (8, 9), it's still far away.\nI can move LEFT again to (3, 7) and eat A(3, 7). This looks like a strong opening.\n\nI will commit to LEFT.\n\nLONG TERM PLAN: Focus on eating the cluster of apples at Y=7 ((3, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7)). Maintain peripheral awareness of Snake #0, which currently controls the top-right corner but poses no immediate threat. Ensure continued pathing options are available as I move leftward.\n\nLEFT",
