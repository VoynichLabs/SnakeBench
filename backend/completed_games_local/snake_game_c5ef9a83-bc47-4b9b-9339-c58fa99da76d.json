          "rationale": "**Thinking out loud:**\n\nMy snake's head is at (1, 2).\n*   **My body:** None. (So I don't have to worry about running into my own tail unless I just ate, which I haven't).\n*   **Board boundaries:** x = 0 to 9, y = 0 to 9.\n*   **Enemies:** Snake #0 is at (3, 1) (Body: none).\n\nLet's evaluate the four possible moves from (1, 2):\n\n1.  **UP:** Moves to (1, 3).\n    *   Is it inside the board? Yes (0<=1<=9, 0<=3<=9).\n    *   Is there an apple? No.\n    *   Is there a snake body? No.\n    *   Is it occupied by another head? Snake #0 is at (3, 1). It might move, but (1, 3) is currently empty.\n    *   **Result:** SAFE.\n\n2.  **DOWN:** Moves to (1, 1).\n    *   Is it inside the board? Yes.\n    *   Is there an apple? No.\n    *   Is there a snake body? No.\n    *   **Result:** SAFE.\n\n3.  **LEFT:** Moves to (0, 2).\n    *   Is it inside the board? Yes (x=0).\n    *   Is there an apple? No (Apples at (9,9), (7,2), (2,8), (4,5), (1,9)).\n    *   Is there a snake body? No.\n    *   **Result:** SAFE.\n\n4.  **RIGHT:** Moves to (2, 2).\n    *   Is it inside the board? Yes.\n    *   Is there an apple? No.\n    *   Is there a snake body? No.\n    *   **Result:** SAFE.\n\n**Strategy (Safety & Goals):**\n*   I have 150 turns and need 50 apples. This is a marathon.\n*   I currently have 0 apples. The nearest apples are at (1, 9) (North) and (7, 2) (East).\n*   Snake #0 is at (3, 1). It is on Row 1. If I go DOWN to (1, 1), I move closer to that row.\n*   **Head-on Collision Risk:** Snake #0 is at (3, 1). It can move to (3, 0), (3, 2), (2, 1), or (4, 1).\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (2, 2) and Snake #0 goes LEFT to (2, 1), we are on different rows, so no collision.\n    *   If I go DOWN to (1, 1) and Snake #0 goes LEFT to (2, 1), no collision.\n    *   If I go UP to (1, 3) or LEFT to (0, 2), I am moving away from Snake #0.\n*   **Apple Pursuit:**\n    *   Targeting (1, 9) seems logical as it is directly North and on the same X axis. Moving UP gets me closer.\n    *   Targeting (7, 2) is East. Moving RIGHT gets me closer.\n*   **Trapping Risk:**\n    *   Moving LEFT to (0, 2) puts me against the wall. While not immediately dangerous (no body), it limits future movement (can't go left). It's better to stay central if possible.\n    *   Moving DOWN to (1, 1) is safe but moving towards the bottom left corner. Still, the bottom row is row 0.\n    *   Moving UP to (1, 3) or RIGHT to (2, 2) keeps me somewhat central.\n\n**Decision:**\nI want to collect apples. The apple at (1, 9) is 7 steps away (vertical). The apple at (7, 2) is 5 steps away (horizontal). The horizontal one is closer. However, the apple at (1, 9) is on my exact X coordinate, which is a straight line, which is usually safer in Snake than navigating turns. Also, looking at the board, Row 2 has an apple at (7, 2) and my head is at (1, 2). Moving RIGHT aligns me with that row.\n\nWait, let's look at the apple at (4, 5). That is also somewhat accessible.\n\nLet's look at the enemy again. (3, 1). If I go RIGHT to (2, 2), I am setting up to move towards (7, 2). If I go UP to (1, 3), I am setting up to move towards (1, 9).\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 2), I am going to a wall.\nIf I go DOWN to (1, 1), I am getting closer to the enemy.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT:\n*   **UP (to 1,3):** Headed towards (1, 9). Safe. Keeps distance from Snake #0 at y=1.\n*   **RIGHT (to 2,2):** Headed towards (7, 2). Safe. Keeps distance from Snake #0 at x=3.\n\nBoth are safe. Let's check if I can immediately eat an apple. No, the nearest is 4 units away (Distance from (1,2) to (4,5) is |4-1|+|5-2|=3+3=6... wait, (7,2) is |7-1|+|2-2|=6. (1,9) is |1-1|+|9-2|=7). So the apples are a few turns away.\n\nI should avoid getting trapped. If I go LEFT, I hit the wall. If I go DOWN, I hit the bottom soon. UP and RIGHT are the most open directions.\nSnake #0 is at (3, 1). It is unlikely to come UP to (3, 2) or (2, 2) immediately unless it wants to eat an apple, but there are no apples near it at (3, 1).\nActually, looking at the board, there is an apple at (7, 2). This is on Row 2. I am at (1, 2). Moving RIGHT is the direct path. This seems like a strong opening move to secure the first apple.\nHowever, if I go UP, I am heading to (1, 9). There is an apple at (1, 9). This is also a direct path.\nBoth are valid.\n\nLet's look at the empty space. Row 2 has: `.` (1), `1` (2), `.` (3), `.` (4)...\nRow 1 has: `.` (0), `.` (1), `.` (2), `0` (3)...\nRow 3 is empty.\nIf I go UP to (1, 3), I have 4 neighbors: (1,2) (my tail effectively, safe), (1,4), (0,3), (2,3). All empty.\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 2), I have neighbors: (1,2) (tail), (3,2), (2,1), (2,3). (2,1) is empty. (3,2) is empty.\n\nI'll choose to go RIGHT towards the apple at (7,2) because it is closer (6 steps) than (1,9) (7 steps), and avoiding the left wall is good. Plus, moving right keeps me in the central part of the board.\n\nWait, I should double check the \"No items\" rule. The prompt says \"Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.\" I will just output the word.\n\nLet's just pick one. I will go RIGHT.\n\nFinal check:\nHead: (1, 2)\nMove: RIGHT -> (2, 2)\nIs (2, 2) safe? Yes.\nIs it a wall? No.\nIs it a snake? No.\nIs it my body? No.\nIs it a head-on collision? Snake #0 is at (3, 1). It moves at the same time. It cannot reach (2, 2) in one turn from (3, 1) (Distance 2).\nSo RIGHT is safe.\n\nAlternatively, UP is also very safe. Let's stick with RIGHT.\n\nThe prompt asks me to write a plan before the final line.\nPlan: Move towards the apple at (7, 2) to score the first point of the game. Maintain distance from enemy Snake #0.\n\nThe final move must be the last line.\n\nDecision: I will move RIGHT.\n\nWait, looking at the board again...\nRow 2: `. 1 . . . . . A . .`\nWait, the board string shows:\n`2 . 1 . . . . . A . .`\nLet's map this carefully.\nIndex: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nChar:  . 1 . . . . . A . .\n\nSo at Row 2:\nCol 0: .\nCol 1: 1 (My head)\nCol 2: .\nCol 3: .\nCol 4: .\nCol 5: .\nCol 6: .\nCol 7: A (Apple)\nCol 8: .\nCol 9: .\n\nSo there is an Apple at (7, 2).\nMy head is at (1, 2).\nMoving RIGHT goes to (2, 2). This is correct.\n\nAnother check. Snake #0 is at (3, 1).\nRow 1: `. . . 0 . . . . . .`\nCol 3 is 0.\nSo Snake #0 is at (3, 1).\nIf I go RIGHT, I go to (2, 2).\nIf Snake #0 goes LEFT, it goes to (2, 1).\nIf Snake #0 goes UP, it goes to (3, 2).\nIf Snake #0 goes DOWN, it goes to (3, 0).\nIf Snake #0 goes RIGHT, it goes to (4, 1).\nNone of these heads collide with my head at (2, 2).\nWait, if I go UP to (1, 3) and Snake #0 goes UP to (3, 2), we don't collide.\nIf I go UP to (1, 3) and Snake #0 goes LEFT to (2, 1), we don't collide.\nIf I go UP to (1, 3) and Snake #0 goes... nowhere near me.\n\nBoth RIGHT and UP are safe.\nWhy RIGHT? It targets the closest apple (7,2).\nWhy UP? It targets (1,9).\n(1,9) is further.\nLet's go RIGHT.\n\n**Plan:** Target the apple at (7, 2) to gain an early lead. Avoid the enemy snake at (3, 1).\n\nMove: RIGHT\n\nWait, the prompt says: \"Do not mention future directions after it.\"\nI should put the plan before the move, and the move on the last line.\n\n**Plan:** Head East towards the apple at (7, 2) to secure the first point. Keep distance from Snake #0.\n\n**Move:** RIGHT\n\nWait, the instructions say: \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nSo I need to make sure \"RIGHT\" is the very last thing.\n\nI'll write the rationale first, then the move.\n\nRationale:\nMy head is at (1, 2). I am assessing safe moves.\n- UP to (1, 3): Safe.\n- DOWN to (1, 1): Safe.\n- LEFT to (0, 2): Safe (Wall).\n- RIGHT to (2, 2): Safe.\nI am choosing RIGHT because it moves me toward the apple at (7, 2), which is the closest apple (6 steps away). This is a good start to build an apple lead. The enemy snake at (3, 1) is too far away to collide with me at (2, 2) in one turn.\n\nOne final check on \"Moving directly backwards\".\nMy body is empty. So no backwards move is possible.\nMoving into another snake's body? Enemy has no body.\nMoving into another snake's head? Enemy head is at (3, 1). Distance to (2, 2) is 2. He can't reach me.\nMoving off board? No.\nHitting myself? No body.\n\nResult: Safe.\n\nI will output:\nPlan: Move towards (7, 2).\nRIGHT\n\nWait, \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note... Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nOkay. I will put the plan.\n\nLet's refine the plan. \"Move towards the apple at (7, 2).\"\n\nI'll just write:\n\n**Plan:**\nMove towards the apple at (7, 2) to score points.\n\n**Move:**\nRIGHT\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.\"\nThis likely means I shouldn't say \"I will move RIGHT next turn\" in the explanation, and the final line should just be the word.\nIt doesn't forbid the plan block.\n\nLet's verify the coordinates again.\n0 is bottom left.\nRow 9 is top.\nRow 0 is bottom.\nRow 2 is 2 steps up from bottom.\nMy head is at (1, 2). Y=2.\nApple at (7, 2). Y=2.\nSo they are on the same horizontal line. Moving RIGHT (X+1) is correct.\n\nApple at (1, 9). X=1. So that is vertical line.\nApple at (4, 5). X=4, Y=5.\nApple at (2, 8). X=2, Y=8.\nApple at (9, 9). X=9, Y=9.\n\nSo (7,2) is definitely the closest by Manhattan distance (6 steps).\n(4,5) is 6 steps? |4-1|+|5-2| = 3+3 = 6. Okay, tied for closest.\n(2,8) is |2-1|+|8-2| = 1+6 = 7.\n(1,9) is 7.\n(9,9) is 15.\n\nSo (7,2) and (4,5) are both 6 steps away.\nGoing RIGHT heads to (7,2).\nGoing UP (to 1,3) then potentially RIGHT/UP would head to (4,5).\nHowever, starting with a straight line is usually better for speed and avoiding self-collision.\nAlso, (7,2) is on the right side of the board. The enemy is at (3,1). If I go RIGHT, I am moving away from the enemy. If I go UP, I am moving away too.\n(7,2) is on the edge (x=7). (4,5) is more central.\n(7,2) is safer in terms of walls (only one side is wall). (4,5) is open.\nActually, (7,2) is 2 cells away from the right wall (x=9).\nSo it's not deep in the corner.\nLet's stick with RIGHT.\n\nI will output the plan and then the word.\n\n**Plan:**\nTarget the apple at (7, 2) by moving East. Maintain situational awareness of Snake #0 at (3, 1).\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\" and \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\nSo I need to make sure I don't put anything after the word.\n\nI'll structure it as:\n[Text explanation/plan]\nRIGHT\n\nThe user prompt says \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning. You may also write a short long-term plan...\".\nSo I can combine them.\n\nFinal check:\n- Snake #0 at (3, 1). It moves to (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 2), (4, 1).\n- My move to (2, 2).\n- Collision? No. (2, 2) vs (2, 1) is adjacent, not same cell.\n- What if Snake #0 moves to (3, 2)? Still safe.\n- What if Snake #0 moves to (2, 1)? Safe.\n\nIs there any reason not to go RIGHT?\n- Going LEFT hits wall. Not ideal.\n- Going DOWN gets closer to enemy and wall. Not ideal.\n- Going UP is safe but slower to the closer apple (7,2) vs (1,9).\n- RIGHT is safe and fastest to an apple.\n\nI am confident in RIGHT.\n\nOne detail: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow\". There is no apple at (2, 2).\nSo I just move.\n\nI'll write the plan briefly.\nTarget apple at (7,2).\nMove RIGHT.\n\nDouble check the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" section.\nIt says \"None\".\nSo this is turn 0. First move.\nOkay.\n\nI'll write the response now.**Plan:**\nMove towards the apple at (7, 2) to score the first point. This is the closest apple on the board (Manhattan distance 6). Moving RIGHT also keeps me away from the enemy snake at (3, 1) and maintains central board position.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT",

The enemy snake is at (5, 1).\n2.  **Immediate Dangers:**\n    *   **My Tail:** Since my body is empty, there is no tail behind me. I can move anywhere in terms of self-collision except running into myself if I had a body (which I don't).\n    *   **Enemy Snake:** The enemy head is at (5, 1).\n        *   If I move **RIGHT** to (4, 2): The enemy could move **LEFT** to (4, 1), **UP** to (5, 2), or **DOWN** to (5, 0). The enemy moving **UP** to (5, 2) creates a gap of 1 cell between us. This is a safe distance and the enemy does not threaten (4, 2).\n        *   If I move **DOWN** to (3, 1): The enemy could move **LEFT** to (4, 1) or **UP** to (5, 2). If the enemy moves **LEFT**, we are adjacent. If the enemy moves **UP**, we are safe. However, moving to (3, 1) puts me directly below my previous head position (3, 2). If I were to survive this turn, my tail would move to (3, 2) next turn. While technically not \"immediate\" self-collision (since my body is empty), staying on the X-axis keeps my future movement restricted horizontally. Moving **RIGHT** is generally better for expanding territory.\n    *   **Board Boundaries:** None of the moves are off the board.\n    *   **Obstacles:** No other obstacles (apples don't block, just provide points).\n\n3.  **Apple Strategy:**\n    *   Closest apples: (7, 2) is 4 steps East. (4, 5) is 1 step Up and 3 steps Right.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** brings me closer to both (7, 2) and (4, 5).\n    *   Moving **DOWN** puts me at (3, 1), which is further away from (7, 2) and roughly the same distance to (4, 5) but on a path that might be more contested by the enemy.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    *   **UP** to (3, 3): Safe, but moves away from the closest apple cluster (East) and towards the top wall, potentially limiting space later.\n    *   **DOWN** to (3, 1): Safe (enemy at (5, 1) won't collide if I stay here, unless they move Left to (4,1)). However, this moves towards the enemy slightly and away from the main apple group (East).\n    *   **LEFT** to (2, 2): Safe, but moves away from all apples.\n    *   **RIGHT** to (4, 2): Moves towards the apples at (7, 2) and (4, 5). It is safe from the enemy at (5, 1) because the enemy cannot reach (4, 2) on this turn (closest it can get is (5, 2) or (4, 1)). It also opens up the board to the right side.\n\n    **Conclusion:** **RIGHT** is the best move. It progresses towards apples and maintains a safe distance from the enemy.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (4, 2) to close the gap on the apples at (7, 2) and (4, 5). Maintain safe distance from Snake #0. If the enemy moves UP to (5, 2), I will be adjacent but safe. Next turn, continue East or adjust for the apple at (4, 5).\n\nRIGHT",

The \"0\" is at (6, 9) and \"T\" is at (5, 9). *Correction:* The board state provided shows \"0\" at `(6,9)` and \"T\" at `(5,9)`, but the text description says Enemy Head is `(8,6)` and Body `(8,5)`. I will trust the text description as it usually overrules the visual map for precision, but the map shows no enemy at (8,6). Wait, looking closely at the map:\n        ```\n        9 .

It is safe. It opens up paths to the left edge.\n        *   **UP (to 2, 6):** Moves closer to Y=8 (for apple at 2,8). It is safe. It prepares the vertical climb.\n        *   **DOWN (to 2, 4):** Moves away from all top apples. The only apple low is (5,1), but I am at Y=5, so (5,1) is 4 steps down and right. Going down makes me longer/turns away.\n    *   **Comparison:** UP vs LEFT.\n        *   Target (2,8) requires going UP.

From there, I can go UP to (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9) to eat the apple. This is a straight line.\n        *   If I go **UP**, I am at (2,6). From there, I can go UP to (2,7), (2,8) to eat the apple. This is also a straight line.\n        *   Which is better?\n            *   Apple at (1,9) is worth the same as (2,8).\n            *   (1,9) is slightly further (4 moves vs 3 moves), but (1,9) is also closer to the edge, potentially safer if enemies approach from the right.\n            *   However, (2,8) is 3 moves away. (1,9) is 4 moves away.\n            *   Let's look at the map again. At `(1,9)` there is an apple. At `(2,8)` there is an apple.\n            *   Actually, looking at the map row 9: `.

There is an apple at (2,8) and (1,9).\n            *   Actually, if I go LEFT now, I am getting closer to (1,9). If I go UP, I am getting closer to (2,8).\n            *   However, the apple at (2,8) is right there.\n            *   Let's double check the board.\n            *   My head is (2,5).\n            *   Up is (2,6) -> Empty.\n            *   Left is (1,5) -> Empty.\n            *   Down is (2,4) -> Empty.\n            *   Right is (3,5) -> My tail.\n            *   I have 3 safe moves.\n            *   The closest apple is (2,8).\n            *   The next best is (1,9).\n            *   Moving UP (to 2,6) sets me up for (2,8).\n            *   Moving LEFT (to 1,5) sets me up for (1,9).\n            *   Is there a reason to prefer one over the other?\n            *   The enemy snake #0 is at (8,6).\n            *   The map shows a snake at (6,9) and (5,9)? No, that was a misread. The map is:\n                ```\n                9 . A . . . . . . . A\n                8 . . A . . . . . .

The 'T' is at column 8, row 5.\n            *   The enemy is on the far right.\n            *   I am on the left.\n            *   I am safe.\n            *   I will move **UP** to target the apple at (2,8) first. It is 3 moves away. The other apple (1,9) is 4 moves away.\n            *   Also, (2,8) is an apple. If I eat it, I grow. That might block my path if I am not careful, but growing is good.\n            *   Let's verify (2,6) is empty. Yes.\n            *   Let's verify (2,7) is empty. Map shows row 7: `.` at (2,7). Yes.\n            *   Let's verify (2,8) is Apple. Yes.\n            *   So the path UP, UP, UP eats an apple.\n            *   What about LEFT?\n            *   LEFT to (1,5).\n            *   Then UP to (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9) to eat apple.\n            *   (1,9) is an apple.\n            *   (1,8) is empty (map shows row 8: `. . A...` wait, row 8: `. . A` means (0,8) is `.`, (1,8) is `.`, (2,8) is `A`.\n            *   So (1,8) is empty. (1,7) is empty (row 7 is all dots). (1,6) is empty.\n            *   Both paths are clear.\n            *   The apple at (2,8) is closer.\n            *   I will move UP.\n\n    *   **Summary of Logic:**\n        *   Current Position: (2, 5).\n        *   Moves: UP (2,6), DOWN (2,4), LEFT (1,5) are safe. RIGHT (3,5) is death.\n        *   Target: Apple at (2,8) is the closest reachable apple (3 moves).\n        *   Action: Move UP to approach (2,8).\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nTarget the apple at (2, 8). It is 3 moves away and the closest target. Move UP, then UP, then UP. After eating, re-evaluate for the next closest apple (likely (1, 9) or (5, 1)).\n\nUP",

I have grown to length 4.\n    *   **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at `(8, 9)`, Body at `[(9, 9), (9, 8), (8, 8)]`. Length 4.\n    *   **Apples:** I need to determine which apples remain. I ate (1, 9). The list includes (5, 1), (3, 3), (5, 7), (2, 3), (5, 2). I should check for the apple at (9, 9), which was marked as `T` in the map on turn 14 (Snake #0's tail). If that was actually an apple, I would check if Snake #0 ate it, but they are at (8, 9). However, looking at the prompt, the apples listed are the ones currently on the board. The text \"Apples at:\" usually lists the actual apples. The ASCII map sometimes marks heads/tails as \"T\" or \"0\". Snake #0's tail is at (9, 9). The prompt specifically lists *apples* at: (5, 1), (3, 3), (5, 7), (2, 3), (5, 2). This means the apple at (9, 9) shown in the map was likely not an apple or was eaten. I will stick to the listed apples.\n\n2.  **Safety Check (Moves from (1, 9)):**\n    *   **UP:** Y would be 10. **OUT OF BOUNDS.** -> **DEADLY**.\n    *   **DOWN:** (1, 8). This is my previous body segment (and currently my neck). Moving into the neck counts as moving into own body. -> **DEADLY**.\n    *   **LEFT:** (0, 9). This is within bounds (x=0..9). Is it occupied? My body is at (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7). Enemy body is at (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (8,8). (0,9) is empty. -> **SAFE**.\n    *   **RIGHT:** (2, 9). Is it occupied? My body is at (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7). (2,9) is empty. Enemy is at (8,9). -> **SAFE**.\n\n3.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   I am at the top row (y=9). I cannot go UP. I cannot go DOWN (suicide).\n    *   My options are LEFT to (0,9) or RIGHT to (2,9).\n    *   **Target Analysis:** The closest apples are:\n        *   (3, 3) - Medium distance.\n        *   (5, 7) - Close.\n        *   (2, 3) - Close.\n    *   **Direction Analysis:**\n        *   **LEFT (to 0,9):** Moves me to the top-left corner. This is a \"dead end\" as I would have to come back right to get out. It's generally bad to trap yourself in a corner. It moves me away from the central apples (5,7, 2,3, 3,3).\n        *   **RIGHT (to 2,9):** Moves me towards the center of the board. From (2,9), I have access to (3,9), (2,8) (but careful, (2,8) is body if I grow, but currently (2,8) is body, wait... (2,8) IS my body). Wait, if I go RIGHT to (2,9), my next moves could be DOWN to (2,8) (which is my body - wait, my body is [(1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7)]. If I move to (2,9), my new body becomes [(2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8)]. So (1,9) is the neck. (2,8) is the body segment *after* the neck. (2,8) is NOT the tail. The tail is (2,7). So moving DOWN to (2,8) later is safe *if* I don't run into it, but it's currently occupied by my body. Actually, standard snake rules: moving into any body part is death.\n        *   However, looking at the board, moving RIGHT puts me at (2,9). From there I can go DOWN to (2,8) only if the tail moves away. But wait, I just ate. I grew. The tail *did* move. On turn 14, I was at (1,8). I moved UP to (1,9). I grew. My tail was (2,7). Did it move? Yes, because I didn't eat on turn 14 (I ate turn 14? Wait, turn 14 move was UP from (1,8) to (1,9). The prompt says \"Apples at: (5, 1), (3, 3), (5, 7), (2, 3), (5, 2)\" for *current* turn (Turn 15). It does *not* list (1, 9). This confirms I ate it. So I grew. The tail remains (2,7) for this turn (because growing keeps the tail). So my body is fixed as [(1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7)].\n    \n    *   **Enemy Prediction:** Snake #0 is at (8,9). The only apples listed on the right side are (5,7). He is unlikely to come to (1,9) or (2,9) as there are no apples there. He will likely move towards the center or down. He is not a threat to me in the top-left or top-center.\n\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   **Left:** Leads to a corner. Limits mobility.\n        *   **Right:** Leads to (2,9). From (2,9), I can go DOWN (to 2,8) - occupied, so invalid immediately. I can go LEFT (to 1,9) - occupied. I can go RIGHT (to 3,9) - safe. So from (2,9), I have only 1 safe move (RIGHT). From (0,9), I would have only 1 safe move (RIGHT).\n        *   Wait, looking at the board on turn 14, the column 0 at y=9 is empty. Column 1 is me. Column 2 is empty at y=9.\n        *   Actually, looking at the board state on turn 14:\n             Row 9: `.` `1` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `0` `T`\n             So (0,9) is `.`, (1,9) is `1`, (2,9) is `.`.\n        *   If I go LEFT to (0,9), I am safe. Next turn I would be stuck.\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (2,9), I am safe. Next turn I can go to (3,9) or potentially (2,8) if the tail moved? No, I just ate, so tail (2,7) didn't move. Wait, the tail moves EVERY turn. On turn 14, I moved UP. I ate. The tail (2,7) stayed. On Turn 15 (now), I am deciding a move. If I move, the tail moves. So if I move RIGHT to (2,9), my body becomes [(2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8)]. The tail (2,7) vanishes. So (2,8) becomes occupied by the new body.\n        *   From (2,9), I can go DOWN to (2,8). Is (2,8) occupied? Yes, by my body (the segment that was previously (1,8)). So I cannot go DOWN.\n        *   I can go LEFT to (1,9). (1,9) is occupied by my body (the head from previous turn). So I cannot go LEFT.\n        *   I can go RIGHT to (3,9). This is empty. I can go UP (die).\n        *   So from (2,9), I am forced RIGHT eventually.\n        *   From (0,9), I am forced RIGHT eventually.\n        *   Both (0,9) and (2,9) are \"dead ends\" in the sense that I will have to turn around eventually.\n        *   However, I am currently at (1,9). (2,9) is closer to the apple at (5,7) than (0,9). (2,9) is closer to (2,3). (0,9) is further away from everything.\n        *   Therefore, RIGHT is strictly better than LEFT.\n\n    *   **Wait, is there a DOWN option?**\n        *   I am at (1,9). Body is (1,8). So moving DOWN is suicide (backwards). Correct.\n    \n    *   **Is there a LEFT option?**\n        *   (0,9) is safe.\n    \n    *   **Is there a RIGHT option?**\n        *   (2,9) is safe.\n    \n    *   **Decision:** I need to escape the top row. Moving LEFT traps me in the corner. Moving RIGHT moves me towards the center.\n    \n    *   **Enemy Head:** Enemy is at (8,9). If he moves LEFT, he goes to (7,9), (6,9)... He is far away. No collision risk.\n\n    *   **Summary:** RIGHT is the only logical move that keeps me moving towards the apples.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move RIGHT to (2,9). From there, continue rightwards to (3,9), (4,9)... to stay on the top row until I can drop down safely towards the central apples (5,7) or (2,3). Avoid getting trapped on the left wall.\n\nRIGHT",

Empty cell.\n\n3.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   I have successfully descended from the top wall. I am now in a relatively open space.\n    *   **Enemy #0 Analysis:** His head is at `(7, 7)`. His body runs up the x=7 column to `(7, 9)`. This means **UP** to `(7, 8)` is blocked for him. He is effectively \"stuck\" in the x=7 column and must move **LEFT**, **RIGHT**, or **DOWN**. I am at x=3, so there is no immediate collision risk with him.\n    *   **Goal:** The apple at `(5, 7)` is very close (distance ~2). The apple at `(3, 3)` is the main cluster (distance ~5).\n    *   **Pathing:** To reach the bottom cluster or open space, I should generally head down. To get the apple at `(5, 7)`, I should head right.\n    *   **Safety vs. Reward:** The apple at `(5, 7)` is the closest target. However, chasing it moves me towards the right side where the board narrows slightly near the walls. Moving **DOWN** to `(3, 7)` centers me and keeps options open for the larger cluster at `(2, 3)` and `(3, 3)`.\n    *   **Decision:** The board is 10x10. I have plenty of space. Moving **DOWN** towards `(3, 3)` is the most sustainable long-term play as it collects the denser cluster of apples. Moving Right to `(5, 7)` is a valid short-term detour but requires me to eventually double back down. Moving **DOWN** now puts me on a direct path to the `(3, 3)` and `(2, 3)` apples.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** to `(3, 7)` keeps me aligned with the apple at `(3, 3)` and avoids clustering with the wall.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Descend towards the central apple cluster at `(3, 3)` and `(2, 3)`. Ignore the top-right apple for now to maintain board control.\n\nDOWN",

Note: The body description in the prompt says `(3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9)`. Wait, looking at the previous turn: My head was `(3, 8)`, body `[(3, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9)]`? No, last turn I was `(3, 8)` with body `[(3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9)]`.\n        *   Let's trace the tail. My tail was `(1, 9)` in the previous turn's body list (`[(3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9)]`).\n        *   Since I ate no apple (I moved from `(3, 8)` to `(3, 7)`, the apple list doesn't show one there), the tail `(1, 9)` should remain stationary.\n        *   So my current body should be: `[(3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9)]`.\n        *   Wait, the prompt says \"Body: `[(3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9)]`\". This implies the snake is length 4 (Head + 3 body segments). If I didn't grow, the tail `(1, 9)` should have moved into `(2, 9)`. No, wait. If I didn't eat, the tail disappears and the snake shifts.\n        *   Previous: Head `(3, 8)`, Body `[(3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9)]`. Tail is `(1, 9)`.\n        *   Move **DOWN** to `(3, 7)`. No apple eaten.\n        *   New Head: `(3, 7)`.\n        *   New Body: `[(3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9)]`.\n        *   New Tail: `(2, 9)` (The old body segment `(1, 9)` is removed).\n        *   **Current Head:** `(3, 7)`. **Current Body:** `[(3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9)]`.\n    *   **Enemy #0:** Head `(6, 7)`, Body `[(7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9)]`.\n    *   **Apples:** `(5, 1), (3, 3), (5, 7), (2, 3), (5, 2)`.\n\n2.  **Safety Check (Moves from `(3, 7)`):**\n    *   **UP:** `(3, 8)` -> **DEADLY**. This is my immediate body (my previous position). Backwards movement is suicide.\n    *   **DOWN:** `(3, 6)` -> **SAFE**. Empty cell.\n    *   **LEFT:** `(2, 7)` -> **SAFE**. Empty cell.\n    *   **RIGHT:** `(4, 7)` -> **SAFE**. Empty cell.\n\n3.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   I must avoid **UP**.\n    *   **Enemy Analysis:** Enemy #0 is at `(6, 7)`. His body is at `(7, 7)`. He is likely to move to open up space. He is trapped in the column `x=7` if he goes UP (hits his body). So he must go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n        *   If he goes **LEFT**, he hits `(5, 7)`.\n        *   If he goes **RIGHT**, he hits `(7, 6)` (Safe).\n        *   If he goes **DOWN**, he hits `(6, 6)` (Safe).\n    *   **Apple Analysis:**\n        *   `(5, 7)`: Distance 2. Very close.\n        *   `(2, 3)`: Distance 5. Further away.\n    *   **Move Options:**\n        *   **LEFT to (2, 7):** Moves towards the bottom-left apples. Opens up path to `(2, 3)`. Safe.\n        *   **DOWN to (3, 6):** Centers me. Safe.\n        *   **RIGHT to (4, 7):** Moves towards `(5, 7)`. Safe.\n    *   **Decision:** The apple at `(5, 7)` is very tempting and close. However, looking at the enemy at `(6, 7)`, if I go **RIGHT** to `(4, 7)`, I am putting myself on a collision course with the enemy if he decides to chase that apple or move left.\n    *   If I go **LEFT** to `(2, 7)`, I am moving away from the enemy and towards the cluster of apples at `(2, 3)` and `(3, 3)`. This is the safer long-term play.\n    *   If I go **DOWN** to `(3, 6)`, I am neutral but moving away from the top apple.\n\n    *   **Correction:** The prompt's board state shows an apple at `(5, 7)`.\n        `7 . . . 1 . A 0 T . .`\n        My head is `1` at `(3, 7)`. The apple `A` is at `(5, 7)`.\n        Distance is 2. To get it, I need to go RIGHT twice.\n        Enemy at `(6, 7)`. Distance to apple is 1.\n        Enemy will almost certainly take `(5, 7)` this turn.\n        If I go **RIGHT** to `(4, 7)`, and Enemy goes **LEFT** to `(5, 7)`, we do not collide (I am at `4`, he is at `5`). But next turn, if I go RIGHT again, I risk collision if he stays there or moves. More importantly, he is eating the apple.\n        Letting him have it is fine.\n        However, if I go **LEFT** to `(2, 7)`, I secure my path to the `(2, 3)`/`(3, 3)` cluster.\n        \n        Let's re-evaluate the \"Right\" move.\n        If I go RIGHT to `(4, 7)`.\n        Enemy goes LEFT to `(5, 7)`.\n        Next turn I am at `(4, 7)`. Enemy is at `(5, 7)`.\n        I can still go for `(5, 7)` if he leaves, but he just ate it. It won't be there.\n        So moving RIGHT is just positioning.\n        \n        Let's look at **LEFT** to `(2, 7)`.\n        This is a safe move. It moves me closer to `(2, 3)` (distance 4).\n        It moves me away from the enemy.\n        \n        The prompt's last rationale (which I \"wrote\") suggested moving towards the `(3, 3)` cluster.\n        **Left** is the direct path to that cluster.\n        **Right** is a detour.\n        **Down** is neutral.\n\n        Let's check collisions.\n        **LEFT** to `(2, 7)` is open.\n        **RIGHT** to `(4, 7)` is open.\n        \n        Is there a risk of head-on collision?\n        If I go **LEFT** to `(2, 7)`:\n        Enemy at `(6, 7)` going **RIGHT** to `(7, 7)` (Blocked by body). He must go LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n        If he goes **LEFT** to `(5, 7)`, we are far apart.\n        \n        If I go **RIGHT** to `(4, 7)`:\n        If Enemy goes **LEFT** to `(5, 7)`, we are adjacent. Safe.\n        If Enemy goes **DOWN** to `(6, 6)`, Safe.\n        \n        **Why LEFT?**\n        The cluster at `(2, 3)` and `(3, 3)` is the most valuable area on the board. It has 2 apples close together.\n        The apple at `(5, 7)` is a single apple.\n        By going LEFT, I claim the left side of the board. By going RIGHT, I am contesting the right side with an enemy who is already there.\n        \n        Also, note the apple at `(3, 3)`.\n        Path: `(3, 7)` -> `(2, 7)` -> `(2, 6)` -> `(2, 5)` -> `(2, 4)` -> `(2, 3)` or `(3, 3)`.\n        Moving LEFT starts this descent.\n        Moving DOWN (to `(3, 6)`) also allows for a descent, but leaves me aligned with the enemy column `x=6`/`x=7`.\n        \n        Let's prioritize the cluster.\n        \n        **Final Decision:**\n        Move **LEFT** towards the cluster at `(2, 3)` and `(3, 3)`.\n        This avoids the immediate competition for `(5, 7)` and sets up a sustainable farming path.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move towards the `(2, 3)` and `(3, 3)` apple cluster.

          "rationale": "START LONG-TERM PLAN\nI am at (2, 2) with 5 apples. I should move to (3, 3) to eat the next apple. I must watch out for the enemy snake at (4, 5); if they move West, they will reach (3, 5), which is not an immediate threat to me at (3, 3), but I will need to calculate their potential moves next turn. After (3, 3), I can try to loop back towards (5, 2) or go up to (5, 9).\nEND LONG-TERM PLAN\n\n1.  **Current State Analysis**:\n    *   **My Head**: `(2, 2)` (I successfully moved DOWN last turn and ate the apple).\n    *   **My Body**: `[(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7)]`. I haven't grown yet (the tail didn't move because I ate), so I am still length 6 effectively, but the new head is at `(2, 2)`.\n    *   **Apples**: `(5, 1), (3, 3), (5, 2), (5, 9), (4, 4)`. The apple at `(2, 2)` is gone.\n    *   **Enemy**: Snake #0 is at `(4, 5)` with body `(5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8)`.\n\n2.  **Move Safety Analysis (from `(2, 2)`)**:\n    *   **UP**: Target `(2, 3)`. This is occupied by my own body (specifically the segment following my old head). **INVALID / KILL**.\n    *   **DOWN**: Target `(2, 1)`. This cell is empty. It is within bounds (0-9). It is not my body. It is not the enemy body. **SAFE**.\n    *   **LEFT**: Target `(1, 2)`. This cell is empty. **SAFE**.\n    *   **RIGHT**: Target `(3, 2)`. This cell is empty. **SAFE**.\n\n3.  **Strategic Selection**:\n    *   I have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n    *   **Goal**: Reach the next apple.\n    *   **Target Apples**: `(3, 3)` is Manhattan distance 2 (Right then Up, or Up then Right). `(5, 1)` is Manhattan distance 4. `(5, 2)` is Manhattan distance 3.\n    *   **Option RIGHT -> (3, 2)**: From here, I am distance 1 from `(3, 3)` (Up). This is the closest apple.\n    *   **Option DOWN -> (2, 1)**: From here, I am distance 3 from `(3, 3)` (Right, Right, Up) or distance 3 from `(5, 1)` (Right, Right, Right, Down). This puts me slightly closer to the bottom edge, which is safer but delays the closest apple.\n    *   **Option LEFT -> (1, 2)**: Moves away from all immediate apples. **BAD**.\n\n    *   **Conflict Check**: The enemy snake is at `(4, 5)`.\n        *   If I move **RIGHT** to `(3, 2)`, I am 3 units away from the enemy head. The enemy cannot reach me next turn (max movement 1).\n        *   If the enemy moves aggressively West towards me, they are still far away.\n        *   **(3, 2)** is safe from collision. It opens up `(3, 3)` next turn.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** is the greedy move for the apple at `(3, 3)`.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** is the \"safe\" move, keeping me near the wall.\n    *   Since the enemy is at `(4, 5)` and not threatening `(3, 2)` or `(3, 3)` immediately, I should take the path to the closest apple. Moving Right puts me directly below the apple at `(3, 3)`.\n\nDecision: Move **RIGHT** to `(3, 2)`.\n\nRIGHT",

If it moves RIGHT to (3,2), it could position itself to grab (3,3) next turn.\n\n4. **Move evaluation**:\n   - DOWN to (4,4): Would directly eat the apple at (4,4) - **IMMEDIATE POINT**\n   - UP to (4,6): Moves away from immediate apple positions\n   - LEFT to (3,5): Moves toward the left side where (3,3) is located\n\n5. **Risk assessment**:\n   - If I move DOWN to (4,4), I'll be eating the apple and growing by 1 segment\n   - Need to check if any enemy could head-on collide with me at (4,4)\n   - The enemy is at (2,2) and cannot reach (4,4) in one move\n   - Moving DOWN is safe and immediately gains a point\n\n6. **Long-term positioning**:\n   - After eating (4,4), my head will be at (4,4) and my body will extend\n   - This puts me in the center of the board with good access to multiple apple clusters\n   - I'll still be positioned to reach the right-side cluster (5,2), (5,1), (5,9)\n   - I'll also maintain access to the left-side area where (3,3) is located\n\n**Decision rationale**: I have a clear opportunity to eat the apple at (4,4) immediately by moving DOWN. This is a safe move that directly increases my score from 4 to 5, giving me a 1-apple lead over the enemy who is at 4. The enemy cannot reach (4,4) in one move, so there's no risk of head-on collision. This move also positions me well for future turns in the center of the board.\n\n**Long-term strategy**: Take the immediate apple at (4,4) to gain the lead, then position myself to access the right-side apple cluster (5,9), (5,2), (5,1) while monitoring the enemy's movements. The center position after eating will give me flexibility to move in any direction.\n\nDOWN",

The cell is currently empty. The closest enemy segment is at `(4, 5)` (distance 2). My own body is at `(3, 3)`? No, my body is at `(2, 3)`.

The apple at (5, 9) is distant.\n- **Option 1 (UP to (3, 4)):** This moves me generally North.

From (4, 3), I am 2 cells away from the apple at (6, 3). However, this brings me closer to the enemy snake's potential path and the guarded apples at (5, 1/2).\n- **Long-term Plan:** Snake #0 is currently blocking access to the apples on the right side of the board. Engaging them directly is risky. The apple cluster at (5, 1), (5, 2), (2, 0) is highly contested. Since Snake #0 is currently at (5, 4) guarding the (5, 1/2) apples, I should pivot to the apple at (2, 0). To reach (2, 0), I need to start heading downwards/leftwards. However, I cannot move Left (body) or Down (backwards). The only open paths are Up or Right.\n    - Moving **UP** sets up a future turn where I can turn Left or Down to loop toward (2, 0).\n    - Moving **RIGHT** takes me away from (2, 0) and towards the enemy cluster.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **UP** is the only safe and strategic direction that keeps the path to the \"safe\" apple at (2, 0) open, while avoiding the immediate danger of my own body.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nSurvive. Snake #0 is guarding the bottom-right apples. Pivot to the bottom-left apple (2, 0) to catch up. Avoid engaging Snake #0 directly.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nUP",
