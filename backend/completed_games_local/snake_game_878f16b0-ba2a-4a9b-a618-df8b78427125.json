After this move the only direction that would re\u2011enter my own body is LEFT, which can be avoided until the body shifts away.\n\n**Plan for the next few turns**  \n1.

Moving LEFT opens up more options and could lead toward the apple at (3, 5) or (2, 1). Moving DOWN is risky as it could lead to getting trapped at the bottom edge.\n\n**Final decision:**\nUP - This move keeps me on the right side of the board and potentially closer to the apple at (9, 9), while also moving me away from the bottom edge and keeping me in a position to reach other apples.\n\nUP",

The closest apples are at (9, 9), (5, 7), (3, 9), and (0, 9). Moving UP keeps me on the right side of the board and potentially closer to the apples at (9, 9) and (5, 7). Moving DOWN moves me away from the apples on the right side of the board.\n\n**Final decision:**\nUP - This move keeps me on the right side of the board and potentially closer to the apple at (9, 9), while also moving me up and keeping me from getting too close to the right edge.\nUP\n**END NEW RATIONALE**\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:**\nIf I move UP to (9, 5), I should consider moving UP to (9, 6) or LEFT to (8, 5) next, depending on the enemy snake's position. If I move DOWN to (9, 3), I should consider moving DOWN to (9, 2) or LEFT to (8, 3) next, depending on the enemy snake's position. I should avoid moving RIGHT as it would move me off the board.\nRIGHT",
