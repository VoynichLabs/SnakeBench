My body is at [(5, 0), (5, 1)].\n\nChecking all four directions from (6, 0):\n- UP to (6, 1): Safe, on board, empty cell.\n- DOWN to (6, -1): Off the board! Would kill me. NOT SAFE.\n- LEFT to (5, 0): This is my own body! Moving here would kill me. NOT SAFE.\n- RIGHT to (7, 0): Safe, on board, empty cell.\n\nSafe moves: UP, RIGHT.\n\nEvaluating apple distances from my current position (6, 0):\n- (9, 2): distance 5 (closest!)\n- (6, 9): distance 9\n- (9, 6): distance 9\n- (9, 7): distance 10\n- (2, 9): distance 13\n\nMove analysis:\n- UP to (6, 1): Distance to (9, 2) becomes 4. From (6, 1), I'll have 3 safe follow-up moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) after my body shifts.\n- RIGHT to (7, 0): Distance to (9, 2) becomes 4. From (7, 0), I'll only have 2 safe follow-up moves (UP, RIGHT) due to the edge of the board.\n\nUP gives me more flexibility for future moves. While both moves are equally efficient toward the closest apple at (9, 2), being at (6, 1) allows me to potentially go LEFT to explore other areas of the board or access other apples if needed. The enemy at (6, 8) is far away and will likely target the apple at (6, 9) first, which is just one move above them.\n\nStrategy: Go UP to maintain flexibility and continue toward (9, 2).\n\nUP",

Death.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT:\n- LEFT gets me closer to the apple at (2, 9) - only 1 step away\n- LEFT keeps me on a clear path: (3, 9) \u2192 (2, 9) for the apple next turn\n- DOWN moves me away from the apple and doesn't provide any strategic advantage\n\nThe enemy at (6, 3) is far enough that they won't collide with me this turn regardless of which direction we both move.\n\nLEFT is clearly the best move. It positions me to collect the apple at (2, 9) on the next turn.\n\nPlan for next turns: After moving to (3, 9), continue LEFT along the top row to grab the apple at (2, 9).

But this moves me away from the cluster of apples at (7, 0) and (8, 1).\n\n2. **DOWN to (5, 0)**: My own body. Death.\n\n3. **LEFT to (4, 1)**: My own body. Death.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 1)**: Empty cell, safe. This positions me well to reach the nearby apples.\n\nFrom (6, 1), I can reach:\n- Apple at (8, 1): RIGHT to (7, 1), then RIGHT to (8, 1) - 2 turns\n- Apple at (7, 0): RIGHT to (7, 1), then DOWN to (7, 0) - 2 turns\n- Apple at (7, 0): DOWN to (6, 0), then RIGHT to (7, 0) - 2 turns\n\nThe enemy snake is far away at (9, 7) and is likely heading toward apples (7, 3) or (7, 4), which are closer to them. There's no risk of head-on collision.\n\nRIGHT is the best move - it gets me to apples in just 2 turns and keeps me in a controlled corner of the board.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to (6, 1), then head toward either (7, 0) or (8, 1) for an apple.\n\nRIGHT",
