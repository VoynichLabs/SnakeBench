Our head is at (5,9) and the enemy snake #1 is at (1,9). There are apples everywhere, but we gotta be smart. \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude08\n\nFirst, let's check all four moves for IMMEDIATE DEATH risks:\n\n- UP: (5,10) \u274c Off the board! YIKES. That's a no-go.\n- DOWN: (5,8) \u2705 On the board. No snake body there (only apples and empty cells). Safe.\n- LEFT: (4,9) \u2705 On the board. Currently empty (just an apple at (4,9)? Wait, the board shows an 'A' at (4,9) \u2013 that's an apple, not a snake. So safe to move into.\n- RIGHT: (6,9) \u2705 On the board. Empty cell. Safe.\n\nSo UP is off the table. DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are all safe.\n\nNow, which one is BEST? Let's think strategy. \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udcad\n\nLong-term plan: We want to box in the enemy! He's at (1,9) \u2013 top-left corner. We're at (5,9). We have a chance to cut off his space early. If we go LEFT, we move towards him and potentially block his paths. Also, there's an apple at (4,9) \u2013 if we go LEFT we snag it immediately! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc40 That's content AND growth. Plus, it puts us closer to the enemy.\n\nWhat about the enemy's possible moves? His head is at (1,9). He can't go UP (off board), so he can go DOWN to (1,8), LEFT to (0,9) (off board? wait, (0,9) is valid), or RIGHT to (2,9). Actually, (0,9) is on the board \u2013 x=0,y=9 is bottom-left? Wait no: coordinates from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right. So (0,9) is top-left corner \u2013 that's on board. So enemy can go LEFT to (0,9), DOWN to (1,8), or RIGHT to (2,9).\n\nIf we go LEFT to (4,9), we eat the apple and grow. Then our body becomes [(4,9), (5,9)]? Actually, since we just ate, our tail grows \u2013 so we'd have head at (4,9), then body at (5,9). That means next turn we have a body segment behind us.\n\nBut importantly, we're now at (4,9), which is closer to the enemy. If he goes RIGHT to (2,9), we might be able to cut him off further.\n\nGoing DOWN to (5,8) is safe, but there's no apple there. It just moves us away from the enemy and the apple at (4,9).\n\nGoing RIGHT to (6,9) is also safe, but no apple and moves us away from the action.\n\nSo LEFT is clearly the best: get the apple, grow, and pressure the enemy early! \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udcaa\n\nAlso, note: if we go LEFT, we are moving into the apple cell. That means we don't risk a head-on collision with the enemy? Because he's at (1,9) and we're going to (4,9) \u2013 not the same cell. So no collision risk this turn.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the move.\n\nRationale for next turn: We just ate an apple at (4,9). Our body is now [(4,9), (5,9)]. Enemy is at (1,9). We should continue pressuring him by moving leftwards (to (3,9) or similar) to cut off his space, but also be mindful of our new body segment. Possibly try to force him into a corner.\n\nLEFT",

Look at that board \u2013 empty top row with that juicy apple at (4,9) just beggin' to be snatched. But our foe at (5,9)? He's eyein' it too, probably slidin' LEFT to gobble it up like the greedy noob he is. Let him have his little snack; we're playin' 4D chess here! \ud83d\ude08\n\nFirst off, scoutin' my moves from (1,9): UP? Nah, that's a straight plummet off the top \u2013 instant RIP, chat would RAGE. LEFT to (0,9)? Safe, but hugs the edge like a coward, limits our flex later. RIGHT to (2,9)? Also safe, scootin' toward center, but why chase his apple when he's got dibs? DOWN to (1,8)? BOOM, safe AF, and it's a highway straight down column 1 \u2013 all clear .s from row 8 to 6, landin' us on that fat apple at (1,5) in just 4 turns! \ud83d\ude80 No bodies blockin', no edges trappin' us. Keeps our options WIDE open for dodges and counterplays.\n\nOpp's moves? He can't go UP, dummy. If he LEFT to (4,9), he grows \u2013 fine, we'll use his ego against him later. If he DOWN to (5,8) or RIGHT to (6,9), still no collision with our DOWN vibe. Head-on? Zero risk here. We're increasin' our apple odds BIG time while he wastes turns. Ruthless plot: Let him feast once, then we cut off his lanes after we grow \u2013 box that fool into a corner by turn 10! \ud83d\udc80 Who's with me, chat? SPAM THOSE EMOJIS!\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**  \nHead straight DOWN column 1 for 4 turns to snag (1,5) apple \u2013 clear path, grow to length 2, then pivot toward center apples like (3,4) or (5,1) while monitoring opp's growth. Stay central, avoid edges, start herding him toward the bottom-right with aggressive fakes next cycle. No risks, max eats, trap by turn 15!  \n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",

Our body is [(4,9), (5,9)] \u2013 we've got a little length now, gotta be careful not to bite ourselves! \ud83d\ude08\n\nEnemy snake #1 is still chilling at (1,8) with no apples. Let's box this fool in! \ud83e\udd4a\n\nFirst, IMMEDIATE DEATH check for each move from our head at (4,9):\n\n*   **UP: (4,10)** \u274c Off the board! YIKES. We'd die instantly. That's a NO.\n*   **DOWN: (4,8)** \u2705 On the board. Currently just an empty cell or an apple? Board shows a '.' at (4,8). Safe. Also, no enemy body there.\n*   **LEFT: (3,9)** \u2705 On the board. Cell is empty. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT: (5,9)** \u274c\ud83d\udc80 That's our own body segment! We'd crash into ourselves. That's a MAJOR throw. ABSOLUTELY NOT.\n\nSo UP and RIGHT are out. We're deciding between DOWN and LEFT.\n\nNow, which is the SMART move? \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udcad\n\n**DOWN to (4,8):**\n*   Pros: Opens up the board southward. There's an apple at (3,8) nearby. We stay flexible.\n*   Cons: Moves us *away* from the enemy at (1,8). Lets him breathe and maybe grab apples on the top rows. Not aggressive enough! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**LEFT to (3,9):**\n*   Pros: Puts DIRECT PRESSURE on the enemy! We're moving into his space, cutting off his potential escape routes along the top wall. This is how we start the boxing-in process! \ud83d\udea8\n*   Cons: Slightly riskier path long-term as we're near the edge, but we have to be aggressive to win!\n\nLong-term plan: We need to trap snake #1 against the top and left walls. Moving LEFT gets us closer to doing that. We can then potentially work our way down, forcing him into a corner. If we go DOWN now, we're giving up early pressure. Chat, we're not here to play safe, we're here to WIN! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nThe apple at (3,8) will still be there if we go LEFT this turn and then DOWN next turn. We can't let the enemy get established.\n\nThe move is clear. WE PRESS THE ATTACK! \ud83d\udc4a\n\nLEFT",

LEFT to (0,8)? Empty, but left wall's a coffin; chat, you know I hate gettin' pinned! RIGHT to (2,8)? Also clear, scootin' center toward that (3,8) apple tease, but why detour when DOWN to (1,7) is WIDE OPEN? Row 7 col1 empty AF, leads straight to (1,6) empty, then BAM (1,5) apple on turn 4.

It keeps us central, giving us SO MANY options for future moves towards other apples like the ones at (8,4) or (9,7). We're playing for the long game, CHAT! We're building a winning position!\n\n*   **DOWN to (3,7):** Also okay, heads towards an apple, but it puts us on a path that might get cramped later.\n\n*   **LEFT to (2,8):** This moves us TOWARDS the enemy. We have a length advantage, but engaging him directly right now is risky! He could move unpredictably. Let's build our lead FIRST!\n\nWE'RE PLAYING SMART, NOT JUST AGGRESSIVE! Let's take the move that maximizes our future options and starts our map control! CENTER CONTROL IS KEY! \ud83d\udddd\ufe0f\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** RIGHT!

Time to apply the pressure!\n\n**IMMEDIATE MOVES CHECK \ud83e\uddd0:**\n\n*   **UP to (4,9):** \u274c\ud83d\udc80 That's OFF THE BOARD! Yikes, instant death! ELIMINATED.\n*   **DOWN to (4,7):** \u2705 Cell is '.' and on the board. SAFE! Opens up the middle.\n*   **LEFT to (3,8):** \u2705\u2753Cell is '.' but... wait, let's see... THAT'S OUR NECK! Our body is [(3,8), (3,9)]. Moving LEFT from (4,8) to (3,8) is moving BACKWARDS INTO OUR OWN BODY! That's a SELF-KILL! Chat, we can't do that! \u274c\ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATED!\n*   **RIGHT to (5,8):** \u2705 Cell is '.' and on the board. SAFE! Heads towards the right side.\n\nSO! ONLY TWO SAFE MOVES: DOWN and RIGHT. Let's get tactical! \ud83e\udd14\n\n**OPPONENT PREDICTION:** Enemy head at (2,6). They have TWO apples right next to them! \ud83c\udf4e At (1,5) and (2,6)... wait, (2,6) is THEIR current head? No, the board shows 'T 1' at (2,6) and (1,6)? Let's read carefully... \"Snake #1 - Head: (2,6), Body: [(1,6)]\". So their head is at (2,6), which is an apple location? The apple list says (1,5) and (5,5)... oh! The board shows an 'A' at (1,5) and another at (5,5). So from (2,6), their best move is probably DOWN to (2,5) which is empty and gets them closer to the (1,5) apple, or LEFT to (1,6) but that's their own body! So they might go DOWN for the apple.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR THE WIN \ud83c\udfc6:** We gotta trap this guy! He's stuck on the left side. If we move RIGHT, we continue controlling the center and top-right, heading towards the apple cluster at (9,7), (9,6), (8,4). If we move DOWN, we go deeper into the center, maybe towards (5,5).

Aggression wins games, chat!\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** After eating the (6,8) apple, we'll be longer. Next turn, prioritize moving DOWN or LEFT from (6,8) to avoid boxing ourselves into the top-right corner. Start the descent to pressure the center!\n\nRIGHT lets us score AND dominate the map!

But which one is the VICTORY MOVE? \ud83e\udde0\n\n**OPPONENT PREDICTION & COLLISION CHECK \ud83e\udd3c**\nEnemy #1 head is at (1,4).

They are likely heading DOWN/LEFT to vacuum up all those juicy apples on the bottom-left! They're distracted! This is OUR CHANCE to cut them off and take control of the board!\n\n**APPLE ACQUISITION TIME! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\ude80**\nLOOK CHAT! Check out these apples we can SNATCH!\n*   (5,5) - Two moves away if we go DOWN then LEFT.\n*   (8,4) - A couple moves away if we go RIGHT then DOWN.\n*   (9,6) - Super close! Just RIGHT then UP next turn... but wait, UP from (7,7) is (7,8) which is safe? HOLD UP.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY - CONTINUE THE SQUEEZE! \ud83d\udce6\ud83d\udd2a**\nOkay, our plan from last turn was to DESCEND and control the center-right. DOWN to (6,6) fits that perfectly! BUT WAIT! The apple at (9,6) is RIGHT THERE! If we go RIGHT to (7,7), we're in a prime position to grab it next turn (UP to (7,8) is safe, RIGHT to (8,7) then UP also works). Then we'd have 4 apples and be LONGER! BUT going RIGHT pushes us further right, which might limit our options later... HMM.\n\n**FUTURE OPTIONS CHECK - AVOID TRAPS! \ud83e\udea4**\n*   **DOWN to (6,6):** From there, we can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN. MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY! We stay central and can cut off the enemy's path to the right side of the board.\n*   **RIGHT to (7,7):** From there, UP is to our body? NO! (7,8) is '.'! So UP, DOWN, LEFT are options. Still flexible! But we're committing to the right side.\n*   **LEFT to (5,7):** This moves us AWAY from the cluster of apples on the right (9,6, 8,4) and towards the enemy's territory. RISKY! We don't want a head-on collision if he decides to move right.\n\nLEFT feels like giving up our positional advantage. So it's between DOWN for pure control and RIGHT for the aggressive apple grab!\n\n**THE VERDICT! \ud83c\udfc6**\nGRABBING THAT APPLE AT (9,6) STARVES THE ENEMY AND EXTENDS OUR LEAD! It's a content play AND it maintains our pressure on the right side! Going RIGHT sets up an easy, safe snack next turn! Let's get even BIGGER and scarier! CONTENT AND CONTROL! WE TAKE IT!\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** We're grabbing the apple at (9,6)! Next turn, move UP from (7,7) to (7,8) to snag it! Then we can reassess, but we'll be a 5-segment MONSTER controlling the top-right corner! LET'S GOOOO! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udf4e\n\nRIGHT",

WHAT'S THE PLAY? \ud83e\udde0**\n\n*   **LEFT to (4,6):** \ud83d\ude80 THIS IS THE CONTINUATION OF OUR PLAN! We move WEST, further cutting off the left side of the board!

This is AGGRESSIVE TERRITORY CONTROL! \ud83e\udd29\n*   **UP to (5,7):** This moves us NORTH. It's safe, but it's kinda PASSIVE! We're moving away from the action. There's an apple at (5,7) on the list? Wait, list has (5,7)! YES! CONTENT! \ud83c\udf4e But is it worth abandoning our strategic positioning? Maybe not! We need to stay committed to the long-term win! \u274c\n\n**THE VERDICT! \ud83c\udfc6**\nLEFT IS STILL THE MOVE! WE STAY ON MISSION! We are building the prison walls! Let them have their feast down south; soon they will have nowhere to go! We claim (4,6) and continue our dominance on the left flank! THIS IS HOW WE WIN! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:**\nWE'RE HEADING TO (4,6)! THE ENEMY IS FEASTING IN THE SOUTHWEST. OUR NEXT MOVE SHOULD CONTINUE TO RESTRICT. FROM (4,6), WE CAN GO DOWN TO (4,5) TO CHALLENGE THEIR SPACE OR LEFT TO (3,6) TO FURTHER SEAL THE LEFT WALL. THE GOAL REMAINS: BOX HIM INTO THE BOTTOM AND FORCE A CRASH. DO NOT ABANDON THE PLAN FOR SHORT-TERM CONTENT! STAY DISCIPLINED! \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f\n\nLEFT",
