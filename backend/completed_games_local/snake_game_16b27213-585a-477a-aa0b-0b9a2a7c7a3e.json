This is safe. It is not currently occupied by my body. The closest body segment is at (3, 2).

LEFT maximizes survival + scoring (immediate apple, reduces deficit), improves position for future apples like (2,2) or (3,6), avoids edge-trapping.

DOWN best: maximizes apple proximity/scoring chance (setup for (3,6) before enemy possibly takes it), keeps 2+ options open (right/down), avoids traps/edges. LEFT/UP reduce mobility toward goals, let enemy extend lead. Enemy likely up/right/down (UP swaps positions but followable; RIGHT lets it eye (3,6) but I can trail; DOWN opens (2,6) for me).\n\n### Short-term plan:\nDOWN to (2,7) now (secure path center); next, RIGHT to (3,7) if empty (chase (3,6), ~1-2 turns to eat if uncontested; if enemy takes (3,6), pivot DOWN to (2,6) then RIGHT or toward (2,2) ~3 moves); if enemy at (2,8) post-swap, go RIGHT/DOWN avoid loop; 2-3 turns target (3,6) or (2,2) (+2-3 apples to 8-9); watch enemy for (7,4)/(7,3), circle right if needed; long-term, use top-right clearance to loop for right apples, stay >5 length behind to avoid blockades.\n\nDOWN",
