The closest apple is (4, 0) (distance 4 horizontal, 2 vertical). The second closest is (7, 5) (distance 1 horizontal, 3 vertical).\n\nEnemy Snake #0 is at (1, 8). It is far away.\n\nLet's evaluate possible moves from (8, 2):\n\n1.  **UP** to (8, 3):\n    *   Board bounds: Safe (0 <= 8, 3 <= 9).\n    *   Self-collision: Safe (body is empty).\n    *   Enemy collision: Safe. Snake #0 is at (1, 8).\n    *   Apple check: No apple at (8, 3).\n    *   Safety: Safe move.\n\n2.  **DOWN** to (8, 1):\n    *   Board bounds: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: Safe.\n    *   Enemy collision: Safe.\n    *   Apple check: No apple at (8, 1).\n    *   Safety: Safe move.\n\n3.  **LEFT** to (7, 2):\n    *   Board bounds: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: Safe.\n    *   Enemy collision: Safe.\n    *   Apple check: No apple at (7, 2).\n    *   Safety: Safe move.\n\n4.  **RIGHT** to (9, 2):\n    *   Board bounds: Safe (9 is max x).\n    *   Self-collision: Safe.\n    *   Enemy collision: Safe.\n    *   Apple check: No apple at (9, 2).\n    *   Safety: Safe move.\n\nSince all four moves are safe, I should choose the one that gets me closest to an apple or maximizes future options.\n\nThe nearest apples are (7, 5) and (4, 0).\n\n*   Moving to (7, 2) (LEFT) brings me closer to (4, 0). Distance to (4, 0) becomes $\\sqrt{(7-4)^2 + (2-0)^2} = \\sqrt{9+4} = \\sqrt{13} \\approx 3.6$.\n*   Moving to (8, 3) (UP) brings me closer to (7, 5). Distance to (7, 5) becomes $\\sqrt{(8-7)^2 + (3-5)^2} = \\sqrt{1+4} = \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.2$. (If I go UP, next turn I could try RIGHT or UP again).\n*   Moving to (9, 2) (RIGHT) is poor for immediate targets.\n*   Moving to (8, 1) (DOWN) is poor for immediate targets.\n\nMoving UP to (8, 3) seems strategically advantageous as it targets the visually closer high-Y apple (7, 5) sooner, potentially allowing me to move towards the cluster of apples in the top-right quadrant later (6, 8), (6, 9), (9, 9).\n\nLet's confirm the paths relative to the nearest apple (7, 5):\nCurrent (8, 2). Target (7, 5). Difference (-1, +3).\nIf I go UP to (8, 3), the next step could be LEFT to (7, 3) or UP to (8, 4). This seems like a reasonable approach towards (7, 5).\n\nStrategy note: Move towards the nearest apple (7, 5) initially, prioritizing moves that stay central or slightly towards the upper half of the board where most apples are concentrated. (8, 3) helps achieve this.\n\nMy projected next move if I choose UP:\nCurrent: (8, 2) -> UP -> (8, 3).\nNext turn I might try LEFT to (7, 3) or UP again to (8, 4).\n\nThis seems like the best path forward compared to heading towards the bottom-left corner apple (4, 0) from (8, 2).\n\nLong-term plan: Target apple (7, 5) first, then assess the clustered apples (6, 8), (6, 9), (9, 9). Keep awareness of Snake #0 far up north.\n\nMove: UP\n\nUP",

Now I need to determine the next move from (8, 3).\n\nPossible moves from (8, 3):\n\n1.  **UP** to (8, 4):\n    *   Bounds: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: Safe: (8, 4) is not (8, 2).\n    *   Enemy collision: Snake #0 is at (2, 8).

(8, 2) is my tail/previous position.\n\n3.  **LEFT** to (7, 3):\n    *   Bounds: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: Safe: (7, 3) is not (8, 2).\n    *   Enemy collision: Safe.\n    *   Apple check: No apple at (7, 3).\n\n4.  **RIGHT** to (9, 3):\n    *   Bounds: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: Safe: (9, 3) is not (8, 2).\n    *   Enemy collision: Safe.\n    *   Apple check: No apple at (9, 3).\n\nSafe moves: UP (8, 4), LEFT (7, 3), RIGHT (9, 3).\n\nTarget apple (7, 5) is still the closest priority.\nCurrent position (8, 3). Target (7, 5). Difference (-1, +2).\n\n*   Move LEFT to (7, 3): Reduces X distance to target by 1. Current distance to (7, 5) is $\\sqrt{(8-7)^2 + (3-5)^2} = \\sqrt{1+4} = \\sqrt{5}$. After moving to (7, 3), new distance to (7, 5) is $\\sqrt{(7-7)^2 + (3-5)^2} = \\sqrt{0+4} = 2$. This is a good move towards the target.\n*   Move UP to (8, 4): Distance to (7, 5) becomes $\\sqrt{(8-7)^2 + (4-5)^2} = \\sqrt{1+1} = \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41$. This seems to move me closer in terms of Euclidean distance! (Wait, $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.23$. $\\sqrt{2}$ is smaller).\n*   Move RIGHT to (9, 3): Distance to (7, 5) becomes $\\sqrt{(9-7)^2 + (3-5)^2} = \\sqrt{4+4} = \\sqrt{8} \\approx 2.82$. This moves me further away from (7, 5).\n\nComparing UP ($\\sqrt{2}$) and LEFT ($\\sqrt{4}=2$): UP moves me to (8, 4), reducing the vertical gap by 1 while keeping the horizontal gap the same. LEFT moves me to (7, 3), reducing the horizontal gap by 1 while keeping the vertical gap the same.\n\nIf I choose UP to (8, 4), next turn I can try LEFT to (7, 4) to eat the apple at (7, 5) on Turn 4 (assuming no interference).\nIf I choose LEFT to (7, 3), next turn I can try UP to (7, 4) or UP to (7, 5) (if that is beneficial).\n\nLet's examine the path to (7, 5) using UP:\nT1: (8, 2) -> UP -> (8, 3)\nT2: (8, 3) -> UP -> (8, 4). Distance to (7, 5) is $\\sqrt{2}$.\nT3: (8, 4) -> LEFT -> (7, 4). Distance to (7, 5) is 1.\nT4: (7, 4) -> UP -> (7, 5) **(Eat Apple!)**\n\nLet's examine the path to (7, 5) using LEFT:\nT1: (8, 2) -> UP -> (8, 3)\nT2: (8, 3) -> LEFT -> (7, 3). Distance to (7, 5) is 2.\nT3: (7, 3) -> UP -> (7, 4). Distance to (7, 5) is 1.\nT4: (7, 4) -> UP -> (7, 5) **(Eat Apple!)**\n\nBoth paths reach the apple in 4 total moves from the starting position (8, 2). The UP path maintains slightly better centralization/higher board position initially. UP also keeps an escape route towards the other clustered apples (6, 8), (6, 9), (9, 9).\n\nEnemy Snake #0 is far away at (2, 8). No immediate threat.\n\nI prefer the path that keeps me higher up, so UP seems marginally better for overall board positioning related to the upper apples.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving towards apple (7, 5) using the sequence UP, LEFT, UP. Be aware of the possibility of finding shorter paths or encountering opponents.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules and win conditions:\n[... rules remain the same ...]\n\nYour objective:\n[... your objective remains the same ...]\n\nDecision process for each move:\n[... decision process remains the same ...]\n\nYou may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\nYou may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns.

Distance to (7, 5) is 1.\nT4: (7, 4) -> UP -> (7, 5) **(Eat Apple!)**\n\nIf we move UP to (8, 5):\nT3: (8, 4) -> UP -> (8, 5). Distance to (7, 5) is $\\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2}$.\nT4: (8, 5) -> LEFT -> (7, 5) **(Eat Apple!)** - This takes 2 turns to reach the apple cell from (8, 4).\n\nSince LEFT leads to the cell adjacent to the apple ((7, 4) adjacent to (7, 5)), guaranteeing a collision with the apple on the next turn (Turn 4), this is the best immediate choice, assuming Snake #0 doesn't interfere.\n\nEnemy Snake #0 is at (2, 8) and moving this turn. Its destination is unknown. Since it is far away, immediate concern about collision is low, but we cannot assume it stays put.\n\nWe choose LEFT to optimize the path to the closest apple (7, 5).\n\nLong-term plan: Move LEFT to (7, 4) to set up eating (7, 5) next turn. Afterwards, re-evaluate target apples. (6, 8), (6, 9), (9, 9) are the next closest group potentially. (4, 0) is far.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMy current state:\nBoard size: 10x10\nMy head: (8, 4)\nMy body: [(8, 3), (8, 2)] (length 3)\nEnemy Snake #0 head: (2, 8)\n\nApples: A1=(4, 0), A2=(6, 8), A3=(7, 5), A4=(6, 9), A5=(9, 9)\n\nLast move was LEFT, resulting in Head=(7, 4), Body=[(8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2)].\n\nNew position: (7, 4). Target apple is (7, 5).\nWe are perfectly set up to eat (7, 5) by moving UP.\n\nSafe moves from (7, 4):\n\n1.  **UP** to (7, 5):\n    *   Bounds: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: Safe. (7, 5) is not in [(8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2)].\n    *   **Apple check: EAT (7, 5).** We gain a point and grow.\n    *   Enemy collision: Snake #0 moves from (2, 8) to somewhere new. Highly unlikely they land on (7, 5).\n\n2.  **DOWN** to (7, 3):\n    *   Bounds: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: Safe.\n    *   Apple check: No apple.\n\n3.  **LEFT** to (6, 4):\n    *   Bounds: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: Safe.\n    *   Apple check: No apple.\n\n4.  **RIGHT** to (8, 4):\n    *   Bounds: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: **DEAD**. Hits (8, 4) (my previous position).\n\nSafe moves: UP (7, 5) [Eat], DOWN (7, 3), LEFT (6, 4).\n\nThe move UP leads directly to eating apple (7, 5). This is the highest priority action available.\n\nEnemy movement consideration: Snake #0 starts at (2, 8). If it moves RIGHT maximally, it reaches (6, 8) or (7, 8). (6, 8) is an apple location, so it might move there. Even if it moves towards our location, (7, 5) is highly unlikely to be a collision point for the enemy head this turn.\n\nWe choose UP to collect the apple.\n\nNew snake length will be 4. New head (7, 5), new body [(7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3)]. Tail (8, 2) drops off.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (7, 5), the closest remaining apples are (6, 8) and (6, 9). We are at (7, 5). We should probably move towards the upper left corner (6, 8/6, 9). Moving LEFT/UP immediately seems appropriate.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDecision process for this turn (Turn 4):\nMy head is now at (7, 5) because I ate the apple. My body is [(7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2)]. Length 5.\nApple (7, 5) is gone.\nRemaining Apples: (4, 0), (6, 8), (6, 9), (9, 9).\nSnake #0 is still at (2, 8).\n\nNew head: (7, 5). Body: [(7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2)].\n\nSafe moves from (7, 5):\n\n1.  **UP** to (7, 6):\n    *   Bounds: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: Safe.\n    *   Enemy collision: Enemy at (2, 8). Safe.\n\n2.  **DOWN** to (7, 4):\n    *   Bounds: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: **DEAD**.

(9, 9) is further away but in the same corner cluster. (4, 0) is very far.\n\nCurrent location (7, 5).\nTarget (6, 8): distance $\\sqrt{(7-6)^2 + (5-8)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 9} = \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.16$.\nTarget (6, 9): distance $\\sqrt{(7-6)^2 + (5-9)^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 16} = \\sqrt{17} \\approx 4.12$.\n\nMove towards (6, 8):\n*   LEFT to (6, 5): Reduces X distance by 1. Distance to (6, 8) becomes $\\sqrt{0 + 3^2} = 3$. This is a good reduction.\n*   UP to (7, 6): Reduces Y distance by 1 towards 8. Distance to (6, 8) becomes $\\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.23$. This seems better!\n\nLet's check the path using UP:\nT4: (7, 5) -> UP -> (7, 6). Dist to (6, 8) is $\\sqrt{5}$.\nT5: (7, 6) -> LEFT -> (6, 6). Dist to (6, 8) is 2.\nT6: (6, 6) -> UP -> (6, 7).

Dist to (6, 8) is 1.\nT7: (6, 7) -> UP -> (6, 8) **(Eat Apple!)**\n\nThe path using UP first reaches a slightly closer relative position ($\\sqrt{5}$ vs $3$) but both result in eating the apple at (6, 8) on Turn 7. Moving UP keeps us higher on the board, which might be advantageous regarding apple (9, 9).\n\nWe select UP.\n\nLong-term plan: Move UP to (7, 6) to begin approach toward apple (6, 8). We should prioritize (6, 8) over (6, 9) as it is closer in Manhattan distance to our current position (if moving towards the corner cluster). We must also be mindful of Snake #0's position (2, 8). If Snake #0 moves towards (6, 8), we might have a problem on Turn 7 or 8. Given the symmetric movement nature, it is safer to aim for the next available spot that minimizes travel time.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMy current state:\nBoard size: 10x10\nMy head: (7, 6)\nMy body: [(7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2)] (length 6)\nEnemy Snake #0 head: (2, 8) [Assuming it moved UP to (2, 9) or RIGHT to (3, 8) or stayed (2, 8) based on last turn's unknown move.

Length 6.\n\nNew position: (7, 6). Target apple (6, 8) is 1 unit away in X and 2 units away in Y. My previous rationale suggested LEFT was slightly worse than UP for T4, but now at (7, 6), LEFT to (6, 6) seems best to approach (6, 8).\n\nSafe moves from (7, 6):\n\n1.  **UP** to (7, 7):\n    *   Bounds: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: Safe.\n    *   Enemy collision: Safe.\n\n2.  **DOWN** to (7, 5):\n    *   Bounds: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: **DEAD**.

Moving LEFT gets us into the direct column alignment for (6, 8) slightly sooner, and might expose us less to the top right corner cluster where (9, 9) is. Let's take LEFT.\n\nLong-term plan: Move LEFT to (6, 6) to align directly below target apple (6, 8). Then move UP twice to collect it.

(9, 9) is much closer. We are currently at (6, 9). We need to move towards X=9, Y=9. Moving RIGHT seems like a good start, potentially followed by moving UP (if Y increases towards 9) or RIGHT again.\n\nFrom (6, 9), only LEFT (5, 9) would cause immediate self-collision if the body occupied (5, 9) but it does not. Wait, my body history is [..., (8, 3), (8, 2)]. No self collision from LEFT. Let's recheck Down: (6, 7) is the cell *behind* (6, 8)'s previous location, which is now (6, 7). So DOWN = (6, 7) is safe if the snake hasn't grown, but it *has* grown.\n\nLet's re-verify self-collision rules for a growing snake: If I move to coordinate C, I die if C is occupied by any body segment *other than the tail segment that would be removed*.\nSnake body before move: Head (H), B1, B2, ..., BT-1, T. New Head H'. New Body B' = (H, B1, ..., BT-1). T is removed.\nMy snake length is 9 before moving UP to (6, 9). Length becomes 10.

The cells occupied by the body *after* the move are: (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6)... The cell (8, 2) is vacated.\nMove UP to (6, 9).\nCheck collisions with: (6, 7), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2).\n(6, 9) is not among these. SAFE.\n\nSo, DOWN to (6, 7) is safe *if the snake had not eaten*. But since I ate, the new tail is (8, 3), and the old tail (8, 2) is removed.\nThe occupied cells *after* eating at (6, 9) will be: (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 7): This is the cell where the body segment (6, 7) *was* located before the move. Since the snake grows, the tail (8, 2) is NOT removed immediately, but the current body segment (6, 7) remains part of the structure *after* the move, if I don't eat.\n\nWait, the rule is: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" This check happens BEFORE body growth/tail removal modifies the occupied squares.\n\nBody occupied squares BEFORE move verification: (6, 7), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2).\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 7): (6, 7) IS occupied by B1. **DEAD**. (Because I did not eat an apple).\n\nIf I move UP to (6, 9) AND EAT: New body segment list is created. The collision check is against the existing body. Since (6, 9) is empty, I live, grow, and the old tail (8, 2) is removed.\n\nSafe moves (non-eating): LEFT (5, 8), RIGHT (7, 8).\nMandatory move: UP (6, 9) [Eat].\n\nI must choose UP.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat (6, 9). Snake is now at (6, 9), length 10. Next target is (9, 9).

(This suggests the snake is NOT dropping tail segments even though it hasn't eaten yet, which contradicts standard rules unless length dictates tail drop relative to score/growth). Standard rule: Tail only drops if no apple eaten OR if length > 1 and no apple eaten.

L=4. (Implies T3 move UP made H=(8, 4), and L increased to 3? No, T3 move explanation said H=(8, 3) -> UP -> (8, 4). If H=(8, 3), B=[(8, 2)] (L=2), UP move to (8, 4) should result in B=[(8, 3)] (L=2). The description contradicts standard mechanics if it resulted in L=4).\n\nI will proceed based on the *results* of the previous decision (which I confirmed was UP to eat (7, 5) resulting in L=5).\n\n**State before current move (T5):**\nBased on my T4 rationale:\nPrevious move was UP to eat (7, 5).\nMy head is now (7, 5). Score = 1. Length = 5.\nBody segments tracking the path backwards from (7, 5) before tail drop: (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2). Tail (8, 2) drops off *after* growth.\nNew Body = [(7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3)]. Length 4 segments + head = 5 total cells.\nThis matches my T5 rationale body description: Body: [(7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2)]. **Wait, my T5 rationale stated the BODY was [(7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2)] before tail drop, meaning L=5. If L=5 and I ate, L_new=6. The tail (8, 2) should drop off, resulting in 5 segments following the head.**\n\nLet's assume L=5 before eating (7, 5) (which means H=(8, 4), B=[(8, 3), (8, 2)] from T3 analysis result). If L=5 before eating, L_new=6. The 5 segments following the head should be: (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (new tail position, which is body segment 5). If L=5 (4 body), eating makes L=6 (5 body segments). The old tail (8, 2) must drop. New body should have 5 segments max.\n\n**Let's trust the T5 rationale description for structure, even if length update seems non-standard:**\nT5 State implied: H=(7, 5). Body size implied 5 segments following head. (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2) are 4 segments listed + H=(7, 5) = 5 segments total. Score 1.\nIf L=5, and an apple was eaten, L SHOULD become 6. The provided body list only shows 4 segments following the head. This means the tail *did* drop off, suggesting L=5 before eating, or L=5 after eating (if growth replaces the drop). Based on the list structure provided in T5 rationale: Body: (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2). This implies 5 total cells if the body is listed head-to-tail, which contradicts the rule that the list provided is head to tail, and the last tuple is the tail.\nIf body list is H, B1, B2, B3, B4. That is L=5. If L was 5 before eating, L=6 after. B4 should NOT drop off.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in tracking from the provided history, I MUST rely on the current state description provided at the START of this turn's evaluation block (Turn 6):\n**Turn 6 Start State (Result of T5 Move UP):**\nYour snake (ID: 1): Head: (6, 7), Body: (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2).\nThis implies L=9 total cells. Score 1. (No growth implied between T4 and T5 evaluation? But T4 rationale clearly stated 1 apple eaten.)\n\nLet's reconcile state: If Score=1 (apple (7, 5) eaten), L must be 5 or more.\n\nIf we assume the body list provided at the start of T6 state is the current configuration (H=(6, 7), 7 body segments listed): L=8 total cells. Score 1. This contradicts the eating of (7, 5) and (6, 8).\n\nI will stick rigidly to the **LAST RATIONALE**'s conclusion about the *next* state after eating (for T6 start):\nT5 Move UP resulted in eating (7, 5). Score=1.\nH=(7, 5). L=L_prev + 1.\nIf L_prev was 4 (implied by T4 analysis structure): L=5. Body segments = 4.\nBody structure assumed: [(7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2)].\nIf L=5, tail (8, 2) remains if we ate? No, if L=4 before growth, the body list has 3 entries.\nIf L=4 before eating (H=(7, 4), B=[(8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2)]). Move UP to (7, 5) EAT. L=5. New Body = B + H_prev = [(8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 4)]. (4 segments follow H=(7, 5)).\n\nT6 Start based on T4 outcome + eat (7, 5): H=(7, 5), B=[(8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 4)]. L=5.\n\nT6 Move LEFT: H=(6, 6). Did not eat. L=5. Tail (8, 2) drops. B=[(7, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 4)].\nT7 Move UP: H=(6, 7). Did not eat. L=5. Tail (7, 4) drops. B=[(6, 6), (7, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3)].\nT7 Move UP (Eat 6, 8): H=(6, 8). L=6. Tail (8, 3) drops. B=[(6, 7), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (8, 4)]. (5 segments).\n\nT8 Move UP (Eat 6, 9): H=(6, 9). L=7. Tail (8, 4) drops. B=[(6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5)]. (5 segments).\n\nMy current evaluation for Turn 9 (based on T8 move UP):\nH=(6, 9). Score=2. L=7. Body = [(6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5)]. (Wait, 5 segments listed, L=6).\n\nLet's use the explicit state provided AT THE TOP of this turn block, as it must reflect the game engine's output, regardless of my complex path reconstruction errors based on previous incomplete rationale blocks.\n\n**Current State (Turn 9):**\nHead: (6, 9). Body: [(6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2)]. L=10. Score 2.\nThis implies 2 apples eaten (7, 5) and (6, 8) based on the coordinates present in the body list structure, or 2 apples eaten in total. Since the *provided* history for T6/T7/T8 implied 2 apples eaten, I accept L=10 and H=(6, 9).\n\nApples remaining: (4, 0), (9, 9). Target (9, 9).\nSnake #0 is still alive at (2, 8) +/- recent moves.\n\nSafe moves from (6, 9):\n\n1.  **UP** to (6, 10): **OFF BOARD. DEAD.**\n2.  **DOWN** to (6, 8):\n    *   Bounds: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: **DEAD**. Hits (6, 8) (B1).\n3.  **LEFT** to (5, 9):\n    *   Bounds: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: Safe. (5, 9) is not in body list.\n4.  **RIGHT** to (7, 9):\n    *   Bounds: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: Safe. (7, 9) is not in body list.\n\nSafe moves: LEFT (5, 9), RIGHT (7, 9).\n\nTarget is (9, 9). Current (6, 9).\nMoving RIGHT to (7, 9) reduces X distance slightly better towards 9 and keeps us close to the top edge.\n\nDistance to (9, 9):\nFrom (6, 9): $\\sqrt{3^2 + 0^2} = 3$.\nIf RIGHT to (7, 9): Distance = 2. (Good reduction).\nIf LEFT to (5, 9): Distance = 4. (Worse).\n\nWe must move RIGHT towards (9, 9).\n\nLong-term plan: Move RIGHT towards (9, 9). Snake is long (L=10), so maneuverability is slightly reduced horizontally, but vertical movement is currently restricted by the head position (Y=9). We need to move RIGHT until X=9, or move slightly down and then right/up. Since (9, 9) is directly right, pure horizontal movement is best when possible.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nMy current knowledge of the state is derived from the end of the previous rationale block (Turn 8 analysis):\nTurn: 9 / 150\nH=(6, 9). Body length 10 (Score 2). Apples: (4, 0), (9, 9).\n\nLast move was RIGHT.\nMove RIGHT from (6, 9) -> (7, 9).\nSnake grew because I ate (6, 9) on T8? No, T8 rationale said H=(6, 9) AFTER eating (6, 9). So Length becomes 10, and tail (8, 2) drops off.\n\n**Current State (Turn 10):**\nHead: (7, 9). Score 3. L=10.\nBody segments for L=10 should be 9 segments following H=(7, 9).\nPrevious body (L=10): (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2). (9 segments + H = 10 cells).\nSince I ate (6, 9) on T8, L became 10, and old tail (8, 2) dropped.\nIf L=9 before T8 eat, L=10 after. Body segment list should have 9 entries.\nThe list provided for T8 start: (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2). (9 entries).\nIf T8 move UP EAT (6, 9), L=10. New body = old body + H_prev = [(6, 8), (6, 7), ..., (8, 3), (8, 2)]. Tail (8, 2) drops.\nNew body (L=10, 9 segments): (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (updated tail coordinate which was (8, 3) before T8). The issue stems from unreliable length tracking in the required format.\n\nI must proceed assuming the T9 right move resulted in H=(7, 9), L=10, Score=3.\n\nSafe moves from (7, 9):\n\n1.  **UP** to (7, 10): **OFF BOARD. DEAD.**\n2.  **DOWN** to (7, 8):\n    *   Bounds: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: Safe (Checking against the body state implied by L=10/Score=3). Assuming (7, 8) is open.\n3.  **LEFT** to (6, 9):\n    *   Bounds: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: **DEAD**. Hits H's previous location (6, 9) now occupied by B1 (if L>1 and no eat). Wait, H_prev was (6, 9). The cell (6, 9) is now the H_prev cell, which is safe unless the snake has shrunk. Since L=10, moving back to the previous H position is usually safe, UNLESS the previous H position is occupied by B1. Since H_prev=(6, 9) and H_new=(7, 9), the cell (6, 9) is now occupied by B1 (the segment immediately behind the head, which was (6, 9) before the move).\n    *   If the move sequence was H(6, 9) -> Right -> H(7, 9). The cell (6, 9) is now occupied by the previous body segment segment B1. **DEAD**. (Since (6, 9) was the head position, it becomes B1).\n\n4.  **RIGHT** to (8, 9):\n    *   Bounds: Safe.\n    *   Self-collision: Safe, assuming (8, 9) is not occupied by the existing 9 body segments ending near the bottom right quadrant.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN (7, 8), RIGHT (8, 9).\n\nTarget is (9, 9). Current (7, 9).\nDistance to (9, 9) is 2.\nMove RIGHT to (8, 9): Distance becomes 1. This is the optimal move to reach (9, 9) next turn.\n\nIf DOWN to (7, 8): Distance becomes $\\sqrt{0^2 + 1^2} = 1$. This also sets up eating (9, 9) next turn if we move RIGHT to (8, 9) then UP to (9, 9), or move RIGHT to (8, 9) then RIGHT to (9, 9) depending on the angle. Moving to (7, 8) is moving away from the X coordinate target.\n\nWe choose RIGHT to advance along Y=9 towards X=9.\n\nLong-term plan: Move RIGHT to (8, 9) to position immediately next to apple (9, 9). Then move UP to eat it. We must assume Snake #0 isn't blocking (9, 9).\n\nRIGHT",
