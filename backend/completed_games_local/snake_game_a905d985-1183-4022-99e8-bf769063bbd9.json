This is where enemy snake is, head-on collision\n4. **RIGHT**: Move to (7, 7) - Safe, no apple, valid\n\n**Strategic Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n\nLooking at nearby apples:\n- (6, 6) is directly below me - DOWN\n- (6, 5) is further down\n- (5, 5) is down-left\n- (1, 7) is far left\n- (9, 7) is far right\n- (9, 8) is upper right\n- (8, 9) is upper right\n\n**Evaluating each safe direction:**\n\n**DOWN to (6, 6)**: \n- No apple at (6, 6) itself\n- Gets me closer to apple cluster around (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6)\n- Good position to explore downward\n\n**UP to (6, 8)**:\n- No apple at (6, 8)\n- Gets me closer to (8, 9), (5, 9), (9, 8) apples\n- Moves away from enemy\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 7)**:\n- No apple at (7, 7)\n- Gets me closer to (8, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 3) apples on the right side\n- Moves away from enemy\n\n**Decision:**\nI'll move UP. This move:\n1. Gets me away from the enemy snake immediately\n2. Moves me toward the cluster of apples at (8, 9), (5, 9), and (9, 8) in the upper portion\n3. Keeps multiple future options open (can go right toward right-side apples or left/down to other areas)\n4. Avoids potential trapping scenarios\n\n**Future Strategy Note:**\nEarly game priority: collect apples efficiently. Since enemy and I are both at length 1, position myself to intercept more apples than the opponent. The upper-right region (8, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7) has good apple density. After collecting a few apples, focus on growing longer while maintaining safe paths and avoiding head-on collisions.\n\nUP",

I need to decide which gives best apple access. Looking at the upper region, there's a good cluster: (8, 9), (5, 9), (9, 8). Moving UP to (6, 9) positions me at the top row, which gives me maximum flexibility to reach either (5, 9) to the left or (8, 9) to the right on the next turn. This also keeps me away from the enemy at (5, 6) in the lower-middle area.\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turns:**\nFocus on collecting apples in the upper region first (8, 9), (5, 9), (9, 8) as they're most accessible. Once I have some length, avoid the center where the enemy might be. The lower-left cluster (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2) is far away but could be a fallback. Keep monitoring enemy position to avoid collisions as both snakes grow.\n\nUP",

This would give me my first apple\n- Moves me away from the enemy's column\n- Excellent move - secure an apple immediately\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 9):**\n- Valid move (in bounds)\n- No apple directly here\n- But there's (8, 9) one step to the right\n- Moves toward the apple cluster in upper right\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nThe LEFT move to (5, 9) is clearly superior because:\n1. It secures an immediate apple (critical for scoring)\n2. It moves me away from the enemy column where they might advance\n3. Once I eat the apple at (5, 9), I'll have length 2, giving me more flexibility\n4. The upper-right region still has (8, 9) and (9, 8) as backup targets\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\nAfter eating at (5, 9), my plan is to continue gathering apples in the upper region. The upper-right has (8, 9) and (9, 8). After securing a few apples, I should move toward the right side of the board to avoid congestion with the enemy who seems to be in the center-left area. Keep monitoring enemy position - they're currently at (6, 6) and might move predictably.\n\nLEFT",

I'm at (5, 9). Moving RIGHT would take me to (6, 9), but that's where my body segment is. That's illegal.\n\nSo my safe moves are:\n- DOWN to (5, 8)\n- LEFT to (4, 9)\n\nBetween these two:\n- Moving LEFT (4, 9) keeps me on the top row and potentially positions me toward middle-left apples\n- Moving DOWN (5, 8) opens up the possibility to move RIGHT on the next turn\n\nMoving DOWN is better because:\n1. It doesn't waste the top row position\n2. On the next turn, I can move RIGHT to (6, 8) and continue toward (8, 9)\n3. It keeps future options open\n\n**Strategy for next few turns:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (5, 8), plan to move RIGHT toward the apple cluster at (8, 9). Monitor enemy movement - currently at (6, 5), they might move up or down. Prioritize the high-value region in the upper-right corner before the enemy expands into it.\n\nDOWN",

UP maintains good positioning for the high-value apple cluster.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nContinue moving UP and RIGHT toward the (8, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7) cluster.

Moving RIGHT keeps me away from them in the top-right corner.\n\n**Best Move:**\nDOWN appears to be the safest continuation that positions me to grab (9, 8) on the next turn. This keeps me in the productive upper-right corner where there are multiple apples clustered.\n\n**Long-term Strategy for Next Few Turns:**\nContinue harvesting apples in the upper-right region: (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 3). The enemy is behind me in apples (4 vs 2), so I need to maximize my apple collection. The right edge provides a natural boundary that keeps me safe while I farm this apple-rich area. Avoid moving left into the center of the board where the enemy might be patrolling.\n\nDOWN",

It:\n1. Keeps me alive (no collisions)\n2. Continues my strategy of farming the right edge\n3. Moves me closer to the apple at (9, 3)\n4. Keeps my future options open (can continue DOWN, LEFT, or UP from here)\n5. Avoids the enemy snake which is now at (8, 7) - I'm moving away from it\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\nContinue moving DOWN the right edge: (9, 6) \u2192 (9, 5) \u2192 (9, 4) \u2192 (9, 3). This collects apples efficiently while staying on the board edge where I have good positional safety. The enemy is currently centered around x=6-7, so the right edge (x=9) remains a safe farming zone. After reaching (9, 3), assess whether to continue LEFT toward the center or continue DOWN.\n\nDOWN",
