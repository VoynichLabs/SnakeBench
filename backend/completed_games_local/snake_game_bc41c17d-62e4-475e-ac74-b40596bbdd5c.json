After I move down, the opponent will likely move up to snag the apple at (5,\u202f6). That leaves us one cell apart \u2013 perfect for future head\u2011on setups or forcing them into a corner. Plus, taking the apple boosts my score right now.\n\nAll safe, all aggressive, and it leaves plenty of follow\u2011up moves (I can keep heading down, or swing left/right later to box them). \ud83d\ude80\n\n**Decision:** DOWN\n\nDOWN",

None of those squares intersect our possible moves, so no head\u2011on risk this turn.  \n\n**Apple hot\u2011spots near us**\n\n- (0,\u202f7) sits up the left wall \u2013 a nice future apple, but it\u2019s four steps away.  \n- (1,\u202f2) is right next to (0,\u202f2) \u2013 an apple we could snatch in just two moves by going **DOWN**, then **RIGHT**.  \n- Below us on the bottom row there are apples at (6,\u202f0) and (8,\u202f0), but they\u2019re far and would require a long detour across the board.\n\n**Why **DOWN** wins right now**\n\n1. **Immediate apple chase** \u2013 moving to (0,\u202f2) puts us right beside the apple at (1,\u202f2). Next turn we can slide right, eat, and grow to 9 segments, extending our lead to 8\u20116.  \n2. **Keeps the left corridor open** \u2013 after the down\u2011move we still sit on the left edge, so we can always retreat upward to (0,\u202f7) later or snake down to the bottom if we need extra space.  \n3. **No collision danger** \u2013 the opponent can\u2019t reach (0,\u202f2) this tick, and there\u2019s no chance of a simultaneous head\u2011on.  \n4. **Maintains strategic pressure** \u2013 while we harvest quick apples, the rival is stuck buzzing around the right column. Their longer body makes turning harder; we\u2019ll soon be the longer snake controlling the left side and ready to cut off any left\u2011ward escape they might attempt.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**\n\n- **Turn\u202f20:** **DOWN** \u2192 (0,\u202f2) (no apple yet).  \n- **Turn\u202f21:** **RIGHT** \u2192 (1,\u202f2) **+APPLE** (score\u202f8).  \n- **Turn\u202f22:** **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,\u202f2) (clear), then start climbing the left wall or loop around the bottom\u2011right as the board opens.  \n\nBy stacking that apple now we strengthen our lead and keep the opponent cramped on the far side. Let\u2019s grab it!\n\nDOWN",
