It brings me closer to the enemy snake (3, 3) and moves me away from the clustered apples on the right.\n- **LEFT**: Moves to (2, 5). This move is safe.

Moving toward the top-right quadrant (where apples are located) is a good strategy.\n- **Plan for future turns**:\n  - If you move **UP** now, you will be at (3, 4) next turn. From there, you can move **UP** again to (3, 5), but Snake #0 already occupies (3, 5) and (3, 6). Instead, you could move **RIGHT** to (4, 4) and then aim for (7, 5) or (8, 6).\n  - If you move **LEFT**, you will be at (2, 3) next turn. From there, you can move **LEFT** to (1, 3) and then **DOWN** to (1, 2), and finally **DOWN** to (1, 1) to reach the apple at (1, 0) in the future.\n  - If you move **RIGHT**, you will be at (4, 3) next turn.

Wait, this seems inconsistent with the rules. Let me clarify:\n  - From the last move, Snake #0's head was at **(4, 5)** and body at **(3, 5)**. It moved **DOWN**, so its new head should be at **(3, 5)** and its body now includes **(4, 5)** (since the head moves first and the tail follows).\n  - However, the current state shows Snake #0's head at **(3, 5)** and body at **[(3, 6)]**, which suggests it moved **DOWN** from **(4, 5)** to **(3, 5)** and then its body segment at **(3, 5)** moved to **(3, 6)**. This is impossible because the body segment cannot move independently of the head. I think there might be a mistake in the board state update.\n  - Assuming Snake #0 moved **DOWN** from **(4, 5)** to **(3, 5)**, its body should now be **[(4, 5)]** (since the head moves first and the previous head position becomes the new body segment).\n\n#### Clarification Needed:\n- The board state seems inconsistent with the rules. Could you confirm the current head and body positions of Snake #0? Specifically, is Snake #0's body now **[(4, 5)]** or **[(3, 6)]**?\n\n#### Apples:\n- (8, 6), (1, 0), (0, 2), (7, 5), (9, 0).\n- The closest apples to your head at **(3, 4)** are:\n  - (0, 2): 3 units away (LEFT + LEFT + DOWN).\n  - (1, 0): 4 units away (LEFT + LEFT + LEFT + DOWN).\n  - (7, 5): 5 units away (RIGHT + RIGHT + RIGHT + UP + UP + UP).\n  - (8, 6): 6 units away (RIGHT + RIGHT + RIGHT + RIGHT + UP + UP).\n  - (9, 0): 7 units away (RIGHT + RIGHT + RIGHT + RIGHT + RIGHT + DOWN + DOWN).\n\n#### Immediate Threats:\n- Snake #0 is at **(3, 5)** and its body segment is at **(4, 5)** (assuming it moved DOWN from (4, 5) to (3, 5)).\n- Moving **UP** from **(3, 4)** would take you to **(3, 5)**, which is Snake #0's head. This would result in a head-on collision and both snakes would die.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to **(4, 4)** is safe.\n- Moving **LEFT** to **(2, 4)** is safe.\n- Moving **DOWN** to **(3, 3)** is safe.\n\n#### Safe Moves:\n- **UP**: Deadly (head-on collision with Snake #0).\n- **RIGHT**: Safe and potentially strategic.\n- **LEFT**: Safe and potentially strategic.\n- **DOWN**: Safe but moves away from apples.\n\n#### Apple Proximity Analysis:\n1. **UP (3, 5)**: Deadly move.\n2. **RIGHT (4, 4)**:\n   - Apple at (7, 5) is reachable in 4 turns (RIGHT + RIGHT + RIGHT + UP + UP + UP).\n   - Apple at (8, 6) is reachable in 5 turns (RIGHT + RIGHT + RIGHT + RIGHT + UP + UP).\n   - Moving RIGHT first allows you to potentially reach the top-right quadrant apples more efficiently.\n3. **LEFT (2, 4)**:\n   - Apple at (0, 2) is reachable in 3 turns (LEFT + LEFT + DOWN).\n   - Apple at (1, 0) is further away but reachable in 5 turns (LEFT + LEFT + LEFT + DOWN + DOWN).\n   - Moving LEFT first allows you to reach the apple at (0, 2) quickly.\n4. **DOWN (3, 3)**:\n   - Moves away from all apples, which is not ideal for growth.\n\n#### Enemy Movement:\n- Snake #0 is at **(3, 5)** and **(4, 5)**. It is currently not a threat to your immediate survival but occupies a position that could become a problem if it grows or changes direction.\n\n#### Future Options:\n- Moving **RIGHT** to **(4, 4)** is safe and allows you to expand toward the top-right quadrant where apples are located.\n- Moving **LEFT** to **(2, 4)** is also safe and allows you to reach the apple at (0, 2) quickly.\n\n#### Long-Term Strategy Note:\n- **Prioritize growth**: Collecting apples early is crucial to gaining body segments and increasing your chances of survival.\n- **Avoid head-on collisions**: Snake #0's head is at (3, 5), so avoid moving UP to (3, 5).\n- **Expand outward**: Try to grow in directions that give you more space and flexibility. Moving toward the top-right quadrant or the bottom-left quadrant (where apples are located) is a good strategy.\n- **Plan for future turns**:\n  - If you move **RIGHT** now, you will be at **(4, 4)** next turn. From there, you can move **RIGHT** again to (5, 4), and then **UP** to (5, 5) to reach the apple at (7, 5) or (8, 6) more efficiently later.\n  - If you move **LEFT** now, you will be at **(2, 4)** next turn. From there, you can move **LEFT** to (1, 4) and then **DOWN** to (1, 3), and finally **DOWN** to (1, 2) to reach the apple at (0, 2) or (1, 0) quickly.\n\n### Final Decision:\nMoving **LEFT** to (2, 4) is the best option as it allows you to reach the apple at (0, 2) in the next few turns, which is closer and safer compared to the top-right quadrant.\n\nLEFT",

Move DOWN to eat the apple at (9, 0).\n2. On the next turn, move LEFT to (8, 0) to avoid the wall.\n3. Continue moving toward the apple at (7, 1). Based on Snake #1's trajectory, I should evaluate if it is racing me for (7,1) or (4,2) and adjust accordingly.\n\nDOWN",

It is closer but still not an immediate threat.\n- Your tail is at **(2,0)**, and your body is **[(3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,0)]**.\n- Moving **DOWN** to **(3,3)** is invalid (backwards into your own body).\n- Moving **LEFT** to **(2,4)** is safe (no collision with your body or enemy).\n- Moving **RIGHT** to **(4,4)** is safe (no collision with your body or enemy).\n- Moving **UP** to **(3,5)** is safe (no collision with your body or enemy).\n\n#### Safe Moves:\n- **LEFT (2,4)**: Safe, but moves away from the apple at **(7,1)**.\n- **RIGHT (4,4)**: Safe, but moves away from the apple at **(7,1)**.\n- **UP (3,5)**: Safe, but moves away from the apples at **(6,7)** and **(8,7)**.\n\n#### Apple Proximity Analysis:\n1. **Apple at (7,1)**:\n   - Distance from current head **(3,4)**: 4 cells right and 3 cells down.\n   - Moving **RIGHT** would take you to **(4,4)**, which is closer to this apple (3 cells right and 3 cells down).\n   - Moving **LEFT** would take you to **(2,4)**, which is farther from this apple (5 cells right and 3 cells down).\n\n2. **Apples at (6,7) and (8,7)**:\n   - Distance from current head **(3,4)**: 3 cells right and 3 cells up (for **(6,7)**) or 5 cells right and 3 cells up (for **(8,7)**).\n   - Moving **UP** would take you to **(3,5)**, still far from these apples.\n\n#### Snake #0 Movement Prediction:\n- Snake #0\u2019s head is at **(6,1)** and could potentially move **UP** to **(6,2)** or **RIGHT** to **(7,1)**.\n- If Snake #0 moves **RIGHT** to **(7,1)**, it will eat the apple there, but it won\u2019t threaten you immediately since you are at **(3,4)** and would be moving to **(4,4)** or **(2,4)**.\n\n#### Defensive and Offensive Maneuvers:\n- Moving **RIGHT** to **(4,4)** is the best choice to keep the apple at **(7,1)** as a potential target for future turns.\n- This move also keeps your snake in a more central position, allowing flexibility for future moves.\n\n#### Decision:\n**RIGHT**\n\n---\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns:\n1. **Turn 19**: Move **RIGHT** to **(4,4)** to stay closer to the apple at **(7,1)**.\n2. **Turn 20**: Assess Snake #0\u2019s position again. If it\u2019s still far away, move **RIGHT** again to **(5,4)** to get closer to the apple at **(7,1)**.\n3. **Turn 21**: If the apple at **(7,1)** is still reachable, move **RIGHT** to **(6,4)** and then **DOWN** to **(6,3)** and **(6,2)** to approach it.\n4. Keep an eye on the apples at **(6,7)** and **(8,7)** for potential future moves.\n5. Avoid dead-ends and maintain flexibility to react to Snake #0\u2019s movements.\n\nRIGHT",

Staying at the bottom or moving RIGHT would restrict my movement against the eastern wall.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1. Move UP to (7, 2) to begin the approach to (6, 7) and (8, 7).\n2.

If I move to (6, 3) and it moves DOWN, we have a head-on collision. Even if it moves elsewhere, (6, 3) is very close to its body.\n4.  **RIGHT:** (8, 3) - **SAFE.** This moves me toward the wall, which is safe but less direct for the apples.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n*   **Proximity to Enemy:** Snake #1 is at (6, 4). If I move UP to (7, 4), and it moves RIGHT to (7, 4), we have a head-on collision. However, Snake #1 is currently horizontal and likely heading toward the apple at (0, 3) or moving up toward (6, 7). \n*   **Apple Targeting:** (6, 7) and (8, 7) are the most immediate targets. Moving UP (7, 4) and then potentially RIGHT or UP again keeps me on a path to either. \n*   **Risk of Head-on:** If I move UP to (7, 4) and the opponent moves RIGHT to (7, 4), we both die. However, looking at the board, Snake #1 is currently at (6, 4) with its body extending to (3, 3). It is more likely to move UP toward (6, 7) or LEFT toward (0, 3). Moving UP for me is the most aggressive and rewarding play. Moving RIGHT (8, 3) is the safer \"coward's\" move to avoid any possible collision at (7, 4).\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving UP is generally the best path to the apples. To minimize the risk of a head-on collision at (7, 4), I see that Snake #1 moving RIGHT is physically possible but unlikely given the apple at (0, 3) and the cluster above. However, to be extra safe and still progress toward the apples, UP is the most logical step to maintain momentum.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nTarget the apples at (8, 7) and (7, 9). These are slightly further from the current position of Snake #1 than (6, 7), reducing the chance of a contested square.\n\nUP",

No immediate threat from Snake #1, as it is at (6, 6). Even if Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (7, 6), there is still a buffer.\n2.  **DOWN:** (8, 3) - **SAFE.** Moves away from apples and toward the corner. Not productive.\n3.  **LEFT:** (7, 4) - **DEATH.** Collision with my own neck/body.\n4.  **RIGHT:** (9, 4) - **SAFE.** Moves toward the wall. Less efficient than moving UP toward the apple.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nThe apple at (8, 7) is the closest target. Snake #1 is at (6, 6) and is likely targeting the apple at (6, 7). \n*   If I move UP to (8, 5) and Snake #1 moves UP to (6, 7), we both secure an apple without immediate conflict.\n*   If Snake #1 tries to move toward the apple at (8, 7) by moving RIGHT to (7, 6), I will still reach (8, 7) faster or at the same time, but (8, 5) is a safe step regardless.\n*   My body is currently trailing behind at x=7 and x=6. Moving x=8 (UP or RIGHT) keeps me clear of my own trail.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP toward (8, 7) to collect the apple. From there, evaluate the proximity of Snake #1 and the availability of apples at (7, 9) or (1, 9). Snake #1 is currently blocking the path to the left (x < 6), so staying on the right side of the board for now is safer.\n\nUP",

This is an apple. **SAFETY CHECK:** Snake 1 is at (7, 7). If Snake 1 moves RIGHT to (8, 7), we will have a head-on collision and both die.\n2.  **DOWN:** moves to (8, 5). **DEATH.** This is my neck.\n3.  **LEFT:** moves to (7, 6). **SAFETY CHECK:** Potential collision if Snake 1 moves DOWN. Also, (7, 6) is very close to Snake 1's head.\n4.  **RIGHT:** moves to (9, 6). **SAFE.** This moves me away from Snake 1 and toward the wall, but provides a safe alternative if I fear the collision at (8, 7).\n\n**Risk Assessment regarding Apple at (8, 7):**\nSnake 1 is at (7, 7) and I am at (8, 6). Both of us are 1 step away from the apple at (8, 7).\n*   If I move UP and Snake 1 moves RIGHT, we both die.\n*   Snake 1's other options: Move UP to (7, 8) (towards apple at 7, 9), LEFT to (6, 7) (backwards/death), or DOWN to (7, 6). \n*   Given the score is tied (6-6), Snake 1 has a high incentive to contest the apple at (8, 7). However, Snake 1 is also closer to the apple at (7, 9).\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nThe risk of a head-on collision at (8, 7) is significant. If I move RIGHT to (9, 6), I stay alive for sure. If I move UP to (8, 7), I might get an apple or I might die. Since the board is open and there are other apples, the \"Safe\" move is RIGHT, but the \"Aggressive\" move is UP. \n\nLooking at Snake 1's position, if they move UP toward (7, 9), they are safer. If they move RIGHT, they risk death. Most players avoid head-on collisions unless they are trailing significantly. However, since I cannot guarantee their move, I will take the slightly safer approach that still puts me in a position to react. \n\nActually, moving UP to (8, 7) is the only way to keep pace. If I move RIGHT and they take the apple, I fall behind. If we both move for it and die, the game is a draw (as apples are currently equal). I will move UP. \n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAttempt to secure (8, 7). If successful, head toward (7, 9) or pivot towards the bottom apple at (6, 0) to clear out of the crowded top-right area. If Snake 1 moves to (7, 8) this turn, avoid moving to (7, 8) or (8, 8) next turn.\n\nUP",

Their most logical move is UP to (7, 9) to get the apple. They cannot move DOWN or RIGHT (to 8, 8) as safely because my body and head are nearby.\n*   If I move UP to (8, 8), and Snake 1 moves UP to (7, 9), I am safe.

Given I have the lead (7-6), survival is the priority.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove to the right edge to create space. Let Snake 1 take the contested apple at (7, 9) if they want it. Then, rotate downward toward the apples at (6, 2) and (6, 0), which are currently \"behind\" my body's current path but will be accessible as my tail (7, 1) clears out in several turns.\n\nRIGHT",

Its next move could be:\n  - **UP** to **(8, 8)**: This would collide with your head if you move **RIGHT** to **(8, 8)**.\n  - **DOWN** to **(8, 6)**: Backwards into its own body, invalid.\n  - **LEFT** to **(7, 7)**: Backwards into its own body, invalid.\n  - **RIGHT** to **(9, 7)**: Safe and away from your path.\n\n#### Defensive and Offensive Maneuvers:\n- If Snake #0 moves **UP** to **(8, 8)**, it would collide with your head if you move **RIGHT** to **(8, 8)**.\n- If Snake #0 moves **RIGHT** to **(9, 7)**, it would not interfere with your move to **(7, 9)**.\n\n#### Decision:\nMoving **UP** to **(7, 9)** is the best choice as it immediately eats an apple, increasing your score and length. The risk of collision with Snake #0 is minimal since its most likely move to interfere (**UP** to **(8, 8)**) is not the one you are choosing. This move also positions you well for future turns, as you can easily move **LEFT** or **RIGHT** from **(7, 9)** without immediate threats.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n1. **Turn 27**: Move **UP** to **(7, 9)** to eat the apple there.\n2. **Turn 28**: Assess Snake #0\u2019s movement and decide whether to move **LEFT** to **(6, 9)** or **RIGHT** to **(8, 9)** to maintain flexibility.\n3. Keep an eye on apples at **(6, 0)** and **(6, 2)** for potential future moves.\n4. Avoid getting trapped near Snake #0\u2019s body; prioritize safe, non-colliding paths.\n\nUP",

My body and Snake 1's body create a vertical barrier in columns 6, 7, and 8.\n*   Snake 1 just ate the apple at (7, 9) and is now at the top edge. Their only safe move is LEFT to (6, 9) or RIGHT to (8, 9).\n*   If I move UP to (9, 8), I maintain a position along the wall. If I move UP again to (9, 9), I can eventually wrap around the top once Snake 1 moves out of the way. \n*   However, the remaining apples (6, 0), (6, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3) are all in the bottom left quadrant. To get to them, I need to wait for my tail to clear or find a gap.\n*   Moving DOWN to (9, 6) keeps me close to the bottom apples and keeps the right wall as a guide.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving UP to (9, 8) feels safer because it prevents me from getting squeezed into the bottom right corner (9, 0) later. From (9, 8), I can observe Snake 1's movement. If they move towards the top-left apples, I can follow or loop around. \n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAscend the right wall to (9, 9) or stay flexible, then wait for the central area to clear. The goal is to reposition toward the lower-left apples ((6, 2), (6, 0)) as the snake bodies shift leftward. Avoid getting trapped in the corner at (9, 9).\n\nUP",

However, if Snake #0 moves **LEFT**, it would be moving into a space adjacent to your current head position, but not directly into it.\n\n#### Defensive and Offensive Maneuvers:\n- Moving **DOWN** to **(8, 8)** is safe and avoids immediate collision with Snake #0\u2019s next move.\n- This move also opens up more space for future maneuvering, especially toward the apple at (1, 9).\n\n#### Decision:\nMoving **DOWN** to **(8, 8)** is the best choice as it keeps you safe from Snake #0\u2019s potential move and maintains flexibility for future turns. This move also does not limit your options unnecessarily.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n1. **Turn 29**: Move **DOWN** to **(8, 8)** to avoid Snake #0\u2019s body and maintain flexibility.\n2. **Turn 30**: Assess Snake #0\u2019s movement. If it moves **LEFT** to **(8, 8)**, it would collide with your head. However, since Snake #0 is unlikely to move into its own body, prioritize moving **LEFT** to **(7, 8)** if no immediate threat.\n3. Keep an eye on the apple at (1, 9) for potential future moves. Plan a route that avoids Snake #0\u2019s body and keeps you in open space.\n4. Avoid getting trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends. Maintain multiple safe follow-up moves whenever possible.\n\nDOWN",
