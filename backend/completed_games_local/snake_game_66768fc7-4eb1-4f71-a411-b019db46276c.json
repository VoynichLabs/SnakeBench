There's an enemy snake at (0,6).\n\nI need to survive and start collecting apples. Let me evaluate my moves:\n\n- UP to (2,3): Safe, open space\n- DOWN to (2,1): Safe, open space\n- LEFT to (1,2): Safe, open space  \n- RIGHT to (3,2): Safe, open space\n\nAll moves are safe. Now I need to consider apple proximity and future positioning:\n\nCurrent head: (2,2)\n\nApples distances:\n- (4,5): Manhattan distance 5\n- (6,7): Manhattan distance 9\n- (7,2): Manhattan distance 5\n- (1,6): Manhattan distance 5\n- (9,4): Manhattan distance 9\n\nThe closest apples are (4,5), (7,2), and (1,6) all at distance 5. \n\nLooking at the board, I need to consider where the enemy snake might move. Snake #0 is at (0,6). They could move right to (1,6) - which is an apple! If they eat that apple, they'll grow. But I can't control their moves.\n\nLet me think about positioning:\n- If I go RIGHT to (3,2), I'm closer to (4,5) and (7,2)\n- If I go UP to (2,3), I'm moving toward the center and can reach multiple apples\n- If I go LEFT to (1,2), I'm moving toward (1,6)\n- If I go DOWN to (2,1), I'm moving away from most apples\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (0,6) and might go for (1,6), I should probably avoid that direction for now and focus on other apples. Moving RIGHT or UP seem most promising.\n\nRIGHT to (3,2) puts me in a good position to go after (4,5) next, or (7,2) eventually. It's also centrally located, keeping options open.\n\nUP to (2,3) is also good, but RIGHT seems slightly better because:\n1. It gets me closer to (4,5) which I can reach in 2 more moves\n2. It keeps me away from the enemy's potential path\n3. It opens up more board space to my right\n\nI'll go RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

However, it maximizes the distance from Snake #0 which is at x=4.\n    \n    Let's look at the board map again.\n    Current Head: (8,2). Tail: (7,2).\n    Apples: (6,7), (9,4), (0,5), (2,8), (1,9).\n    Closest apple is (9,4) at distance $\\sqrt{(9-8)^2 + (4-2)^2} = \\sqrt{1+4} = \\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.24$ turns (actually 3 turns because diagonal movement isn't allowed, strictly Manhattan distance is $|9-8| + |4-2| = 1+2=3$).\n    \n    Path to (9,4):\n    Option A (Right edge): (8,2) -> (9,2) -> (9,3) -> (9,4).\n    Option B (Internal): (8,2) -> (8,3) -> (8,4) -> (9,4).\n    \n    Option A is simple. However, getting stuck on the right edge (x=9) limits future movement to UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n    Option B keeps me at x=8, allowing UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n    \n    Let's check safety of (8,3):\n    -   Up: (8,4).

From (8,3) -> (9,3) (Right).\n    Move 3: (9,4).\n    \n    It's a tie on distance. Let's prioritize board control (not hitting walls).\n    (8,3) allows Left/Right/Up/Down.\n    (9,2) allows Left/Up/Down.\n    (8,3) has more options.\n    \n    BUT, I see an issue. If I move UP to (8,3), I am at (8,3).\n    Next turn, if I want to go to (9,4), I need to go RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.\n    If I move RIGHT to (9,2), next turn I go UP to (9,3), then UP to (9,4).\n    \n    Let's consider the \"rightness\" of the move.\n    The prompt says: \"Among remaining safe moves, favor moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available and move you closer to reachable apples\".\n    \n    (9,2) is on the wall. (8,3) is open.\n    (8,3) is clearly the better choice for future flexibility.\n    \n    However, moving RIGHT puts me at (9,2).\n    Is there any reason NOT to move UP?\n    UP to (8,3):\n    -   Safe from board.\n    -   Safe from self (body is (7,2)).\n    -   Safe from enemy (distance).\n    -   Moves closer to (9,4) (Manhattan distance is same).\n    -   Keeps more options open than moving RIGHT.\n    \n    So, UP is the logically superior move based on the \"keep multiple safe follow-up moves available\" rule.\n    \n    Wait, let me double check the coordinate system.\n    \"0,0 at bottom left to 9,9 at top right.\"\n    So Y increases Up. X increases Right.\n    My head: (8,2).\n    UP: (8,3).\n    \n    Why did the previous turn say \"Moving RIGHT towards (8, 2) sets me up to move towards (9, 4)\"?\n    The previous turn I was at (7,2). I moved RIGHT to (8,2).\n    Now I am at (8,2).\n    To go to (9,4), I need to increase X (Right) and increase Y (Up).\n    \n    Let's check the \"Last Move Rationale\".\n    It says: \"Moving RIGHT towards (8, 2) sets me up to move towards (9, 4)\".\n    It also says: \"RIGHT to (8, 2): Open space.\" (Wait, last turn I was at (7,2), so (8,2) was the target).\n    \n    Now at (8,2).\n    If I move UP to (8,3), I am closer to (9,4) (Manhattan 2) than I was at (8,2) (Manhattan 3).\n    If I move RIGHT to (9,2), I am also closer (Manhattan 2).\n    \n    Let's look at the board map again.\n    Row 2: \". . . . . . .

(Moves away).\n    -   Safety: High.\n    -   Future: Longer path.\n    \n    Move LEFT (7,2):\n    -   New distance: 4. (Moves away).\n    -   Safety: High.\n    -   Future: Longer path.\n    \n    So it's between UP and RIGHT.\n    The \"keep multiple safe follow-up moves available\" rule strongly favors UP.\n    The \"move closer to reachable apples\" rule is satisfied by both equally.\n    \n    Therefore, UP is the best move.\n    \n    However, I must consider if I am missing something about the \"Right\" preference.\n    Is (9,3) safer than (8,3)?\n    (9,3) neighbors: (9,2), (9,4), (8,3), (10,3).\n    (8,3) neighbors: (8,2), (8,4), (7,3), (9,3).\n    (9,3) has the wall at (10,3).\n    (8,3) is completely open.\n    So (8,3) is strictly safer than (9,3).\n    \n    If I am at (8,3), I can go to (9,3).\n    If I am at (9,2), I can go to (9,3).\n    But being at (8,3) is safer in case something goes wrong and I need to retreat or maneuver.\n    \n    Let's finalize the decision.\n    Move: UP.\n    \n    Wait, I should check if the enemy could be at (8,3) next turn.\n    Enemy at (4,6). Max distance 1. Impossible.\n    \n    What about (9,4)? Could enemy take it?\n    Enemy at (4,6). Distance to (9,4) is $|9-4| + |4-6| = 5+2=7$. Impossible.\n    \n    So (9,4) is safe for the foreseeable future.\n    \n    Let's double check the board state for any hidden dangers.\n    Board 9: \". A . . . . . . . .\" (No snakes)\n    Board 8: \". . A . . . . . . .\" (No snakes)\n    Board 7: \". . . . . .

No.\n    -   Dead if I go RIGHT? No.\n    -   Dead if I go DOWN? No.\n    -   Dead if I go LEFT? No.\n    \n    Best move: UP.\n    \n    Wait, is there any apple I missed?\n    Apples: (6,7), (9,4), (0,5), (2,8), (1,9).\n    (9,4) is the closest.\n    \n    Is there any reason to go DOWN? No.\n    Is there any reason to go LEFT? No.\n    \n    Is there any reason to go RIGHT?\n    Maybe to trap myself against the wall? No, that's bad.\n    \n    Is there any reason to go UP?\n    Yes, it maximizes safety options.\n    \n    Wait, I should write down the \"Long-term plan\" as requested.\n    \"Long-term plan: Move towards the apple at (9, 4) by navigating right and up. Prioritizing safety and open spaces.\"\n    \n    Actually, the prompt says: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next turns. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n    \n    So I will output:\n    **START LONG-TERM PLAN**\n    ...\n    **END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n    UP\n    \n    Let's refine the plan.\n    Target: Apple at (9,4).\n    Path: Move UP to (8,3), then RIGHT to (9,3), then UP to (9,4).\n    Avoid: Snake #0 at (4,6).\n    Strategy: Maintain distance from Snake #0, prioritize board openness (center vs edges), and secure the closest apple.\n    \n    One last check on the \"RIGHT\" move.\n    Maybe the \"Right\" move pushes the tail into a spot that blocks something?\n    My tail is at (7,2).\n    If I move RIGHT to (9,2), the body becomes (8,2).\n    If I move UP to (8,3), the body becomes (8,2).\n    In both cases, the body ends up at (8,2).\n    Wait, if I move UP to (8,3):\n    Head (8,2) -> (8,3).\n    Body (7,2) -> (8,2).\n    If I move RIGHT to (9,2):\n    Head (8,2) -> (9,2).\n    Body (7,2) -> (8,2).\n    \n    So in both scenarios, (8,2) becomes occupied by my body.\n    \n    Is there any difference?\n    Yes.\n    If I go UP, I am at (8,3).\n    If I go RIGHT, I am at (9,2).\n    \n    Let's look at the board again.\n    Row 2: \". . . . . . . T 1 .\" (Head 8, Tail 7)\n    Row 3: \". . . . . . . . . .\"\n    \n    If I go UP to (8,3), I am in row 3.\n    If I go RIGHT to (9,2), I am in row 2, column 9.\n    \n    Row 2 has my tail at 7 (which moves to 8).\n    So row 2 will have my body at 8.\n    \n    What if I go UP?\n    I go to (8,3).\n    My body goes to (8,2).\n    This blocks the square directly below me for the next turn (unless I move away).\n    \n    What if I go RIGHT?\n    I go to (9,2).\n    My body goes to (8,2).\n    This blocks the square to my left for the next turn.\n    \n    Both moves place the body at (8,2).\n    The difference is where the head is.\n    \n    (8,3) has neighbors (8,4), (9,3), (7,3), (8,2).\n    (9,2) has neighbors (9,3), (8,2), (9,1).\n    \n    (8,3) has more escape routes.\n    \n    I am confident UP is the better move.\n    \n    One edge case: Snake #0 moves to (5,6) then (6,6) then (7,6) then (8,6) etc. It's too slow.\n    \n    Another edge case: Apple at (9,4) might be eaten by someone else? No other snakes.\n    \n    So, UP is the move.\n    \n    Wait, I'll check the \"Last Move Rationale\" one more time.\n    \"Moving RIGHT towards (8, 2) sets me up to move towards (9, 4) which is at the top right.\"\n    This logic is flawed because moving RIGHT is not the only way to get to (9,4).\n    Moving UP also gets you there.\n    Moving UP is safer.\n    \n    I will follow the logical safety rules.\n    Final decision: UP.\n    \n    I need to write the prompt strictly.\n    \n    **START LONG-TERM PLAN**\n    Target apple at (9,4). Move UP to (8,3) to maintain flexibility and avoid walls.\n    **END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n    UP\n    \n    Wait, I should not mention \"Move UP to (8,3)\" in the plan because the plan is for the *next* turns, not necessarily the immediate move, although it's usually good to be specific. The prompt says \"strategy note to your future self\". It is helpful to know where I am going.\n    Let's just keep it general.\n    \n    **START LONG-TERM PLAN**\n    Continue towards the apple at (9,4). Prioritize staying in open spaces over edges.\n    **END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n    UP\n    \n    One final check. Is (8,3) really open?\n    Board 3: \". . . . . . . . . .\"\n    Yes.\n    \n    Is there any snake at (8,3)?\n    No.\n    \n    Is there any apple at (8,3)?\n    No.\n    \n    So the move is safe.\n    \n    The prompt requires the final output to be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n    \n    I will output the plan block and then UP.\n    \n    Wait, I should check if \"UP\" moves me into the snake #0 body? No, that's at x=4,5,6 mostly.\n    Board 6 has snake 0 head at (4,6).\n    Board 5 has snake 0 body at (4,5), (3,5).\n    My target is (8,3). Distance is huge.\n    \n    Okay, proceed.**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nContinue towards the apple at (9,4). Prioritize staying in open spaces over edges to keep options open.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nUP\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nFrom current position (8, 2):\n- **UP to (8, 3):** Open space. This keeps me off the right edge, maintaining maximum flexibility for future moves while still reducing Manhattan distance to the target apple at (9, 4).\n- **DOWN to (8, 1):** Open space, but moves away from the target apple.\n- **LEFT to (7, 2):** Open space (previous tail position), but moves away from the target apple.\n- **RIGHT to (9, 2):** Open space. However, moving to the edge reduces future options (only 3 directions instead of 4).\n\nSince distance reduction to (9, 4) is equal for both UP and RIGHT (both reduce distance by 1), the decision falls to maximizing future options. Moving UP to (8, 3) is strictly safer than moving to the edge at (9, 2). Snake #0 is far away and cannot interfere.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

(9, 2) and (9, 1) are empty, but eventually leads to the wall. Moving down limits future options significantly.\n- Moving **UP to (9, 5)**: This moves towards the top of the board. There are apples at (6, 7), (1, 9), (4, 9). Moving UP keeps the path to these apples open. (9, 6) is empty. This maintains better board control and options.\n\nI should move UP.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move UP towards the northern apples (6, 7), (4, 9), (1, 9). Avoid getting trapped in the bottom right corner.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "First, I need to evaluate the current board state and plan my next move. My head is at (9, 5). My body is at (9, 4) and (8, 4). The enemy snake #0 is at (2, 8) with a body of length 3. There are apples at (6, 7), (0, 5), (1, 9), (4, 9), and (3, 3). I have collected 2 apples and the enemy has 3.\n\nI must avoid immediate death:\n- If I move LEFT to (8, 5), it is empty, but I must check if it's safe considering enemy movement.\n- If I move DOWN to (9, 4), that is my current body (the segment immediately behind my head). This counts as moving into my own body and would kill me.\n- If I move UP to (9, 6), it is empty.\n- If I move RIGHT to (10, 5), it is outside the board and kills me.\n\nSo, possible immediate moves are LEFT and UP.\n\nNow I need to consider the enemy snake #0. The enemy is at (2, 8) and its body is at [(3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7)].\nThe enemy has several options:\n- It can move UP to (2, 9).\n- It can move DOWN to (2, 7).\n- It can move LEFT to (1, 8).\n- It can move RIGHT to (3, 8), but that is occupied by its own body (the segment behind the head). So, it cannot move RIGHT.\n\nI must check for collisions with the enemy's potential moves.\nMy potential heads:\n- If I move UP: (9, 6)\n- If I move LEFT: (8, 5)\n\nEnemy's potential heads (if it moves UP, DOWN, or LEFT):\n- UP: (2, 9)\n- DOWN: (2, 7)\n- LEFT: (1, 8)\n\nNone of the enemy's possible heads will reach my potential heads ((9, 6) or (8, 5)) in one turn. The Manhattan distance is too large.\n\nHowever, I must also consider if the enemy moves into my body.\nMy body segments if I move UP:\n- New head: (9, 6)\n- Old head becomes body: (9, 5)\n- Old body: (9, 4), (8, 4)\n\nEnemy moving from (2, 8):\n- UP to (2, 9): Safe.\n- DOWN to (2, 7): Safe.\n- LEFT to (1, 8): Safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8, 5):\n- New head: (8, 5)\n- Old head becomes body: (9, 5)\n- Old body: (9, 4), (8, 4)\n- *Correction*: If I move LEFT, my body becomes [(9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4)]? No, the tail is (8, 4).\nWait, let's trace it carefully.\nCurrent: Head (9, 5), Body [(9, 4), (8, 4)].\nIf I move LEFT to (8, 5):\n- Head is (8, 5).\n- The segment at (9, 5) becomes the new first body segment.\n- The segment at (9, 4) becomes the second body segment.\n- The tail at (8, 4) moves to follow (9, 4). (8, 4) is connected to (9, 4) horizontally. (9, 4) moves to... wait. The tail moves to the position of the previous segment.\nActually, the snake just slides.\nNew Head: (8, 5)\nNew Body: (9, 5), (9, 4)\nTail: (8, 4) -> wait, the tail (8, 4) leaves its spot, which is good because it's currently occupied.\nSo the new snake is: Head (8, 5), Body [(9, 5), (9, 4)].\nThis creates a \"hole\" at (8, 4) which is now empty.\n\nNow check enemy collisions against this new body:\nEnemy moving to (2, 9), (2, 7), (1, 8). None hit (8, 5), (9, 5), or (9, 4).\n\nSo both UP and LEFT are mechanically safe from immediate collision.\n\nNow I evaluate the strategic value.\n**Option 1: Move UP to (9, 6)**\n- Space: (9, 7) is empty, (9, 8) is empty, (9, 9) is wall.\n- If I keep going UP, I will hit the wall at (9, 9). This is a dead end. I will eventually have to turn back or turn left.\n- Apples nearby: (6, 7) is West. (1, 9) and (4, 9) are far West and North. (0, 5) is far West.\n- Moving UP puts me in a corner with limited exits. If I go UP, I have to eventually go LEFT. If I go LEFT, I might get stuck behind my own tail or the wall.\n\n**Option 2: Move LEFT to (8, 5)**\n- Space: (7, 5) is empty (row 5: `A . . . . . . . . 1` - wait, let's look at the board).\nRow 5: `A . . . . . . . . 1`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nSo (8, 5) is empty. (7, 5) is empty. (6, 5) is empty. (5, 5) is empty. (4, 5) is empty.\n(0, 5) has an apple.\n- Moving LEFT opens up the entire left side of the board.\n- I can collect (0, 5). Then I can go up towards (1, 9), (4, 9), (6, 7).\n- Moving LEFT gives me much more room to maneuver.\n\nComparing the two:\n- UP leads to a tight corner in the top right. It is risky because if the enemy happens to block my exit or if I am forced to turn back, I might die.\n- LEFT leads to the open board. It connects me to multiple apples and allows for future flexibility.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the superior move for long-term survival and scoring.\n\nWait, let me re-read the board carefully.\nRow 5: `A . . . . . . . . 1`\nThis means (0, 5) is A, and (9, 5) is 1 (my head).\nSo (8, 5) is empty.\n(7, 5) is empty.\n(6, 5) is empty.\n(5, 5) is empty.\n(4, 5) is empty.\n(3, 5) is empty.\n(2, 5) is empty.\n(1, 5) is empty.\n\nI can walk along row 5 to the left.\n\nIs there any immediate threat?\nEnemy is at (2, 8). It has 3 apples. It is aggressive.\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving away from the enemy. The enemy is at Y=8, I am at Y=5. The distance is increasing.\nIf I go UP, I am moving towards the enemy's Y level (8 vs 5), but the X distance is huge (2 vs 9).\n\nActually, let's reconsider the UP move.\nIf I go UP to (9, 6), I can then go LEFT to (8, 6), (7, 6), etc.\nRow 6 is: ` . . . . . . . . . .`\nSo row 6 is completely empty.\nFrom (9, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (3, 6) -> (2, 6) -> (1, 6) -> (0, 6).\nFrom (0, 6) I can go UP to (0, 7) (empty), (0, 8) (empty), (0, 9) (empty).\nSo maybe UP isn't a dead end if I turn LEFT immediately.\n\nHowever, the path UP then LEFT is a 90-degree turn.\nIf I go LEFT now, I am immediately on the open row.\nIf I go UP, I have to make a specific turn later.\nAlso, (9, 5) is an apple? No, the board shows `1` at (9, 5) and `A` at (0, 5). So no apple at (9, 5).\nIf I go UP, the next empty space is (9, 6). No apple there.\nIf I go LEFT, the next space is (8, 5). No apple there.\nThe nearest apple to my head is (0, 5).\nDistance from (9, 5) to (0, 5) is 9.\nIf I go UP to (9, 6), distance to (0, 5) becomes |9-0| + |6-5| = 10.\nSo UP increases the distance to the closest apple (0, 5).\n(6, 7) is distance |9-6| + |5-7| = 3 + 2 = 5.\nIf I go UP to (9, 6), distance to (6, 7) is |9-6| + |6-7| = 3 + 1 = 4. Closer.\n(4, 9) is distance |9-4| + |5-9| = 5 + 4 = 9.\nIf I go UP to (9, 6), distance is |9-4| + |6-9| = 5 + 3 = 8. Closer.\n\nSo UP moves me closer to (6, 7) and (4, 9).\nLEFT moves me closer to (0, 5).\n\nWhich apple is safer to get?\n(0, 5): To get there, I need to cross the board. The enemy is at (2, 8).\nIf I move LEFT, I am moving into the center/left.\nIf I go UP, I am staying on the right side.\n\nLet's think about the enemy's potential targets.\nEnemy is at (2, 8). Apples at (4, 9), (3, 3), (1, 9), (6, 7).\n(1, 9) is close to enemy.\n(4, 9) is close to enemy.\n(6, 7) is close to me (distance 5).\n(0, 5) is close to me (distance 9).\n(3, 3) is somewhat close to enemy (distance |2-3|+|8-3|=1+5=6) and me (|9-3|+|5-3|=6+2=8).\n\nIf I go UP, I am contesting (6, 7).\nIf I go LEFT, I am contesting (0, 5) and (3, 3) and (1, 9).\n\nHowever, (0, 5) is isolated at the bottom left. (1, 9) is top left. (4, 9) is top center. (6, 7) is top right. (3, 3) is bottom center.\nMy current position (9, 5) is bottom right.\nThe enemy (2, 8) is top left.\n\nIf I go UP towards (6, 7), I am moving into the \"North\" region where apples are clustered.\nIf I go LEFT towards (0, 5), I am moving towards the \"West\" and \"South-West\".\n\nThe enemy is likely to go for the apples on the left/top (1,9), (4,9) because they are close to it.\nIf I go UP, I can take (6, 7) which is somewhat close to me and might be contested by the enemy if it goes that way.\nIf I go LEFT, I can take (0, 5) which is far from the enemy.\n\nWhich direction offers better survival chances?\nIf I go LEFT, I have the whole row 5 open. I can also go UP from row 5 eventually.\nIf I go UP, I am on row 6. Row 6 is open. Row 7 has an apple at (6, 7) and an enemy body part at (4, 7) and (4, 8).\nWait, enemy body is at (4, 8) and (4, 7). Head at (2, 8).\nIf I go UP to (9, 6), I can go to (8, 6)... (6, 6).\nFrom (6, 6) I can go UP to (6, 7) to eat the apple.\nBut (6, 7) is near the enemy's territory. The enemy is at X=2, I am at X=6. Distance 4.\nIf I eat (6, 7), I grow. I need to be careful not to get trapped.\n\nLet's look at the board again:\nRow 7: `. . . . T . A . . .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nSo (4, 7) is T (enemy body). (6, 7) is A.\nRow 8: `. . 0 T T . . . . .`\n(2, 8) is 0 (enemy head). (3, 8) is T, (4, 8) is T.\nRow 9: `. A . . A . . . . .`\n(1, 9) is A, (4, 9) is A.\n\nIf I go UP and LEFT, I can approach (6, 7). I will be at (6, 6) then (6, 7).\nThe enemy is at (2, 8). To reach (6, 7), it needs to move Right.\nBut if the enemy moves Right to (3, 8), it dies (hits its own body at (4, 8)? No, (3, 8) is empty? Wait, row 8 shows `. . 0 T T`.\nSo (2, 8) is 0.\n(3, 8) is empty (the dot between 0 and T).\n(4, 8) is T.\n(5, 8) is empty.\nSo enemy can move to (3, 8) (LEFT? No, right). (2, 8) -> (3, 8) is RIGHT.\nIf enemy moves to (3, 8), it is safe. Its body becomes (3, 8), (2, 8) [old head], (3, 8) [old body? No].\nWait, the body list is [(3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7)].\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (3, 8):\n- Head goes to (3, 8).\n- Old head (2, 8) becomes body.\n- Old body shifts. The tail (4, 7) moves to where the previous segment was.\n- New body: (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8).\n- Tail: (4, 8)? No.\nLet's trace: Head (2, 8). Body: (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7).\nWait, the body list is ordered head-to-tail.\nSo: Head (2, 8) -> connected to (3, 8) -> connected to (4, 8) -> connected to (4, 7).\nSo (3, 8) is the neck, (4, 8) is the middle, (4, 7) is the tail.\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (3, 8):\n- New Head: (3, 8)\n- New Neck: (2, 8)\n- New Middle: (3, 8) ??? No, that's where the head went.\nWait. The segment at (3, 8) is currently the neck. It will move.\nIf the head moves to (3, 8), it will occupy the spot currently held by its neck.\nSince the neck is part of its body, if the head moves into the neck's cell, it's a collision.\nIs the neck considered part of the body for collision purposes?\n\"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n\"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nThe neck is the cell immediately behind the head. Moving into it is moving backwards. Yes, that counts as suicide.\nSo the enemy CANNOT move RIGHT to (3, 8). That is its own neck.\nCan enemy move DOWN to (2, 7)?\n(2, 7) is empty (Row 7: `. . . . T . A . . .` at index 2 is empty).\nCan enemy move UP to (2, 9)?\n(2, 9) is empty (Row 9: `. A . . A . . . . .` at index 2 is empty).\nCan enemy move LEFT to (1, 8)?\n(1, 8) is empty.\n\nSo enemy options: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\nNone of these reach my potential positions (9, 6) or (8, 5).\n\nNow, let's decide between UP and LEFT.\nI am at (9, 5).\nIf I go LEFT to (8, 5), I can continue LEFT to (0, 5) to eat the apple.\nIf I go UP to (9, 6), I can go LEFT to (8, 6)...\nActually, if I go UP, I can turn LEFT immediately.\nIf I go LEFT, I can turn UP later.\nThe difference is my starting Y coordinate.\nOption UP: Starts at Y=6. Apples at Y=7, Y=9.\nOption LEFT: Starts at Y=5. Apples at Y=5 (0,5), Y=9, Y=7.\n\nActually, let's look at the \"future options\" part of the strategy.\nI am in the corner.\nIf I go UP, I have: Up, Left. (Right and Down are blocked by wall/body).\nIf I go LEFT, I have: Left, Up. (Right is blocked by body, Down is blocked by wall? No, (9, 4) is body, (9, 5) is head. (9, 4) is immediately below. (9, 3) is empty.\nWait, row 4: `. . . . . . . . T T`\nRow 3: `. . . A . . . . . .`\nRow 2: `. . . . . . . . . .`\nSo below me at (9, 4) is body. (9, 3) is empty. (9, 2) empty. (9, 1) empty. (9, 0) empty.\nSo I could go DOWN.\nBut I must be careful not to trap myself.\n\nIf I go LEFT, I can also go DOWN later if needed (but why?).\nThe main goal is to eat apples.\nDistance to (0, 5) from (9, 5) is 9. From (9, 6) is 10.\nDistance to (6, 7) from (9, 5) is 5. From (9, 6) is 4.\nDistance to (4, 9) from (9, 5) is 9. From (9, 6) is 8.\nDistance to (1, 9) from (9, 5) is 12. From (9, 6) is 11.\n\nSo UP is better for the northern cluster (6,7, 4,9, 1,9).\nLEFT is better for (0, 5).\n\nHowever, (0, 5) is alone. I might eat it, but then I have to travel back to the northern cluster, which is dangerous if the enemy controls the center.\nIf I go for the northern cluster, I am engaging in potential competition with the enemy.\nThe enemy is at (2, 8). It is very close to (1, 9) and (4, 9).\nIf I go for (6, 7), I am at X=6, enemy at X=2.\nI am faster to (6, 7) than the enemy is, likely.\nIf I go for (0, 5), I am safe from the enemy for a while.\n\nBut wait, there is an apple at (3, 3).\nDistance from me (9, 5) to (3, 3) is |9-3| + |5-3| = 6 + 2 = 8.\nIf I go LEFT, I pass near (3, 3).\nIf I go UP, I go away from (3, 3).\n\nLet's calculate the \"threat\" of getting trapped.\nIf I go UP to (9, 6):\n- Next moves: Left to (8, 6), Up to (9, 7).\n- (9, 7) is empty. (9, 8) is empty. (9, 9) is wall.\n- If I go Up, I hit the wall.\n- If I go Left, I open up the board.\nSo UP is safe as long as I don't go too far Up.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8, 5):\n- Next moves: Left to (7, 5), Down to (8, 4).\n- (8, 4) is currently my tail. But if I move Left, my tail moves away.\n- So (8, 4) will be empty.\n- So I can move DOWN to (8, 4).\n- Wait, (8, 4) is currently occupied by my tail.\nIf I move Left to (8, 5), my body becomes (9, 5), (9, 4).\nMy tail becomes (9, 4).\nSo (8, 4) becomes empty.\nSo I can move DOWN from (8, 5) to (8, 4).\nThis is useful.\n\nComparison:\nOption A: Move UP.\nHead becomes (9, 6).\nI am getting closer to (6, 7) and (4, 9).\nI am moving away from (0, 5) and (3, 3).\nThe path is open. (9, 6) is empty.\nI am moving into the \"North\" zone.\n\nOption B: Move LEFT.\nHead becomes (8, 5).\nI am getting closer to (0, 5) and (3, 3).\nI am moving away from (6, 7).\nThe path is open. (8, 5) is empty.\n\nIs there any reason NOT to move UP?\nThe enemy is at (2, 8).\nIf I move UP, I am at (9, 6).\nIf the enemy moves UP, it is at (2, 9).\nIf the enemy moves LEFT, it is at (1, 8).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN, it is at (2, 7).\nNone of these threaten me.\n\nIs there any reason NOT to move LEFT?\nIf I move LEFT to (8, 5).\nEnemy moves... still no threat.\n\nWhich position is more flexible?\n(9, 6): Can go Left (8, 6) or Up (9, 7).\n(8, 5): Can go Left (7, 5) or Up (8, 6) or Down (8, 4).\n(8, 5) offers 3 possible moves (Left, Up, Down). (9, 6) offers 2 (Left, Up).\n(8, 5) has slightly better immediate mobility.\nHowever, (9, 6) is on the way to the apples.\n\nLet's think about the enemy's next move.\nThe enemy has 3 apples. I have 2.\nThe enemy wants to score.\nThe apples available to the enemy are (1, 9), (4, 9), (6, 7), (3, 3), (0, 5).\n(1, 9) and (4, 9) are closest to the enemy.\n(6, 7) is closer to me.\n(0, 5) and (3, 3) are in the bottom/center.\nIf the enemy goes for (1, 9) or (4, 9), it is moving North/East.\nIf I go UP, I am moving North. I might intercept or race.\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving West. I am avoiding the race.\n\nWait, if I go LEFT, I can take (0, 5).\nThen I am at (0, 5). I can then go UP to (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9).\n(0, 9) is empty. (1, 9) has an apple.\nFrom (0, 9), I can go RIGHT to (1, 9).\nThis is a valid path.\nIf I go LEFT, I get (0, 5) -> (1, 9).\nIf I go UP, I get (6, 7) -> (4, 9).\nThe path UP is shorter to (6, 7).\nThe path LEFT is shorter to (0, 5).\n(0, 5) is 9 moves away. (6, 7) is 5 moves away.\n(1, 9) is 12 moves away from start. (4, 9) is 9 moves away.\nFrom (9, 5) -> (9, 6) -> (8, 6) ... (4, 6) -> (4, 7) -> (4, 8) -> (4, 9).\nWait, (4, 8) is enemy body. I can't go through that.\nI have to go (4, 6) -> (4, 7)? (4, 7) is enemy body.\nI have to go around.\nPath to (4, 9): (9, 5) -> (9, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (4, 7)? Blocked.\nI have to go (4, 6) -> (3, 6) -> (3, 7) -> (3, 8) -> (3, 9) -> (4, 9).\n(3, 8) is empty? Row 8: `. . 0 T T . . . . .` -> Index 3 is empty (between 0 and T). Yes.\nSo (3, 8) is safe.\nSo path UP to (4, 9) is viable.\n\nPath LEFT to (0, 5): Straight line.\nPath LEFT to (1, 9): (0, 5) -> (0, 6) -> (0, 7) -> (0, 8) -> (0, 9) -> (1, 9).\n(0, 9) is empty.\n(1, 9) is apple.\n\nSo both paths are viable.\n\nWhich is safer?\nIf I go UP, I am engaging in the \"North\" region where the enemy is.\nIf I go LEFT, I am in the \"West\" region.\nThe enemy is at (2, 8).\nIf I am at (9, 6), I am far away.\nIf I am at (8, 5), I am far away.\n\nHowever, the enemy might try to intercept me if I go for the northern apples.\nBut the enemy is at X=2, I am at X=9. It would take the enemy a long time to reach me.\nThe enemy would likely prioritize (1, 9) and (4, 9).\nI am also going for (6, 7) and (4, 9).\n(6, 7) is contested. (4, 9) is contested.\n(0, 5) is uncontested.\n\nIf I take (0, 5), I increase my score to 3, matching the enemy.\nThen I can go for (1, 9).\nThe enemy might go for (4, 9).\nThen we are tied at 4.\nThe last apple is (3, 3).\nThis seems like a good plan.\nIf I go UP, I might get (6, 7). Score 3.\nThen I might get (4, 9). Score 4.\nBut I have to fight for it.\n\nAlso, looking at the board, (0, 5) is \"safe\" because it's far from the enemy.\n(6, 7) is closer to the enemy.\n\nTherefore, I should go LEFT to secure (0, 5) and then (1, 9).\nThis seems like a lower risk strategy.\n\nWait, let's check the \"Rule\": \"Among the moves that keep you alive, prefer moves that both:\n  * increase your chance of safely eating apples, and\n  * keep future options open\".\n\nGoing LEFT moves me closer to an apple (0, 5).\nGoing UP moves me closer to an apple (6, 7).\nBoth open future options.\nBut going LEFT moves me into a wide open space (Row 5 is completely empty).\nGoing UP moves me into Row 6, which is also empty.\nBut Row 5 connects to the whole board.\nRow 6 connects to the whole board.\n\nLet's check if there is any trap in going UP.\nIf I go UP to (9, 6), I can't go DOWN (backwards). I can go LEFT or UP.\nIf I go LEFT to (8, 5), I can go LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\nDown to (8, 4) is an interesting option.\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 4), I am at (8, 4).\nMy body is (9, 5), (9, 4).\nThen I can go DOWN to (8, 3)? (8, 3) is empty (Row 3: `. . . A . . . . . .` -> Index 8 is empty).\nRow 2: `. . . . . . . . . .`\nRow 1: `. . . . . . . . . .`\nRow 0: `. . . . . . . . . .`\nSo I can go all the way down to the bottom if I want.\nBut why would I?\nI would go LEFT from (8, 4) to (7, 4), etc.\nSo LEFT gives me a route to the bottom half or the left half.\n\nLet's reconsider the UP move.\nIf I go UP, I am at (9, 6).\nIf I then go LEFT, I am at (8, 6).\nI can then go LEFT to (0, 6).\nFrom (0, 6), I can go DOWN to (0, 5) (apple).\nSo UP then LEFT eventually gets me to (0, 5) too.\nBut it takes longer.\nFrom (9, 5) -> (9, 6) -> (8, 6) ... -> (0, 6) -> (0, 5).\nThat's 2 + 8 + 1 = 11 moves to (0, 5).\nDirect LEFT: 9 moves.\nDirect LEFT is much faster to (0, 5).\n\nSo if I want (0, 5), I must go LEFT now.\nIf I want (6, 7), I should go UP now.\n(6, 7) is 5 moves away via UP.\n(0, 5) is 9 moves away via LEFT.\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\nApples: (6, 7), (0, 5), (1, 9), (4, 9), (3, 3).\nI have 2 apples. Enemy has 3.\nI need to catch up.\nIf I get (6, 7) in 5 moves, I get 3 apples.\nThen I can go to (4, 9) or (1, 9).\nIf I get (0, 5) in 9 moves, I get 3 apples.\nThen (1, 9) is nearby.\n(1, 9) is 5 moves from (0, 5).\nTotal to (1, 9) via (0, 5): 9 + 5 = 14 moves.\nTotal to (4, 9) via (6, 7): 5 (to 6,7) + ~6 (to 4,9) = 11 moves.\nSo the UP route seems faster to the next apple.\n\nAlso, the enemy is likely to go for (1, 9) or (4, 9).\nIf I go UP, I am racing for (6, 7) and then maybe (4, 9).\nIf the enemy goes for (4, 9), we might collide.\nIf I go LEFT, I am grabbing (0, 5) which the enemy is far from.\nThen I can grab (1, 9).\nThe enemy might grab (4, 9).\nThen we are tied 3-3.\nI can then go for (3, 3) or (6, 7).\nThe enemy is at (4, 9). I am at (1, 9).\n(6, 7) is closer to enemy (distance 5) than me (distance 6).\n(3, 3) is closer to enemy (distance 8) than me (distance 11).\nSo if we tie at 3, enemy has position advantage for remaining apples.\n\nIf I go UP, I am at (9, 6). (6, 7) is distance 4.\nEnemy at (2, 8). (6, 7) is distance 5.\nI am closer to (6, 7).\nIf I get (6, 7), I am at 3.\nEnemy is likely to get (4, 9) or (1, 9).\n(1, 9) is distance 6 from enemy. (4, 9) is distance 4 from enemy.\nEnemy likely goes for (4, 9). Distance 4.\nI am at (6, 7). Distance to (4, 9) is 3.\nWait, if I am at (6, 7), distance to (4, 9) is |6-4| + |7-9| = 2 + 2 = 4.\nSo we are equal distance from (4, 9).\nIf I go UP, I can contest (4, 9) after taking (6, 7).\n\nIf I go LEFT, I am far from (4, 9).\nSo UP allows me to compete for the northern cluster.\nLEFT isolates me in the west.\n\nIs it good to isolate myself?\nIf I stay in the west, I can eat (0, 5), (1, 9), (3, 3).\nThe enemy can eat (4, 9), (6, 7).\nIf I eat 3 apples (0,5, 1,9, 3,3), I get 5 total. I win.\nIf the enemy eats 2 apples (4,9, 6,7), they get 5 total. Tie.\nBut (3, 3) is far for both of us.\nSo I can probably secure the west.\nThe enemy secures the east/north.\n\nHowever, going UP allows me to disrupt the enemy.\nIf I go UP, I might take (6, 7) and (4, 9). That would put me at 4 apples. Enemy at 3.\nThen I win.\n\nSo UP is high risk, high reward.\nLEFT is low risk, low reward.\n\nI need to win. I am behind.\nI should take the risk to catch up.\nAlso, UP is only 1 move away. I can always turn LEFT later.\nIf I go LEFT, I am committed to the west path for a while.\nIf I go UP, I keep my options open to go West or North.\n\nWait, if I go UP to (9, 6), I can't go Right. I can go Left or Up.\nIf I go Left to (8, 6), I can go Left, Up, Down.\nSo I can still go West.\nSo UP is actually more flexible than LEFT?\nIf I go LEFT to (8, 5), I can go Left, Up, Down.\nI can't go Right (blocked by my body).\nSo I have 3 options.\nIf I go UP to (9, 6), I have 2 options (Left, Up).\nSo (8, 5) is slightly more flexible.\nBut (9, 6) leads to more apples.\n\nLet's check the \"Safety Check\" again.\nEnemy moves.\nIf enemy moves UP to (2, 9), it is safe.\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (1, 8), safe.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (2, 7), safe.\nNone reach me.\n\nIf I move UP to (9, 6), I am safe.\nIf I move LEFT to (8, 5), I am safe.\n\nI think I will choose UP because it puts me in a position to contest the apples that are closer to me than the enemy (specifically (6, 7)).\n(6, 7) is closer to me (dist 5) than enemy (dist 5? Wait, enemy dist |2-6|+|8-7|=4+1=5). Equal distance.\n(4, 9) is closer to enemy (4) than me (9 from current pos, 8 from 9,6).\n(1, 9) is closer to enemy (6) than me (12).\n(0, 5) is closer to me (9) than enemy (10).\n(3, 3) is closer to me (8) than enemy (6).\n\nSo the apples are distributed.\n(6, 7) is contested.\n(4, 9) favors enemy.\n(1, 9) favors enemy.\n(0, 5) favors me.\n(3, 3) favors me slightly.\n\nIf I go UP, I go for (6, 7) (contested).\nIf I go LEFT, I go for (0, 5) (favors me).\n\nWhich is safer?\n(0, 5) is far away. The enemy has to cross the board to interfere.\n(6, 7) is closer to the enemy.\n\nAlso, consider my tail.\nCurrent tail: (8, 4).\nIf I go UP, tail becomes (9, 4).\nIf I go LEFT, tail becomes (9, 4).\nWait, if I go UP: Head (9, 6), Body (9, 5), (9, 4). Tail (8, 4) -> No, tail leaves (8, 4).\nIf I go UP: Head (9, 6), Body (9, 5), (9, 4). The tail moves to (9, 4)? No.\nStart: Head (9, 5), Body [(9, 4), (8, 4)].\nMove UP: Head (9, 6).\nNew body: [(9, 5), (9, 4)].\nSo the tail is (9, 4).\nThis means (8, 4) becomes empty.\nSo I have created a hole at (8, 4).\n\nIf I go LEFT: Head (8, 5).\nNew body: [(9, 5), (9, 4)].\nTail is (9, 4).\nHole at (8, 4).\n\nSo both moves result in the same body configuration (just head position differs).\nBody: (9, 5), (9, 4).\nTail: (9, 4).\n\nWait, if I go LEFT, the body is (9, 5), (9, 4).\nIf I go UP, the body is (9, 5), (9, 4).\nYes, because the middle segment (9, 4) stays, and the tail (8, 4) leaves.\n\nSo the body structure is identical in both cases.\nTherefore, the only difference is the head position.\n\nHead positions: (9, 6) vs (8, 5).\nWhich is better?\n(9, 6): Top right corner. Walls at X=10, Y=10.\n(8, 5): Slightly inside. Walls at X=10, Y=10, Y=0.\n(8, 5) is safer from walls.\nBut (9, 6) is not immediately dangerous.\n\nLet's look at the next move possibilities.\nIf Head is (9, 6):\n- Left to (8, 6): Safe. (8, 6) empty.\n- Up to (9, 7): Safe. (9, 7) empty.\n- Down to (9, 5): Occupied by body. DEAD.\n- Right to (10, 6): Wall. DEAD.\nOptions: Left, Up.\n\nIf Head is (8, 5):\n- Left to (7, 5): Safe. (7, 5) empty.\n- Up to (8, 6): Safe. (8, 6) empty.\n- Down to (8, 4): Safe (hole created). (8, 4) empty.\n- Right to (9, 5): Occupied by body. DEAD.\nOptions: Left, Up, Down.\n\n(8, 5) has strictly more options (3 vs 2).\nMore options = better \"future options open\".\nAlso, (8, 5) allows me to go DOWN to (8, 4).\nWhy would I go DOWN to (8, 4)?\nFrom (8, 4), I can go LEFT to (7, 4), then DOWN to (7, 3)...\nThis allows me to access the bottom area.\nApples in bottom area: (3, 3).\n(8, 5) -> (8, 4) -> (7, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 3).\nThat's a clear path to (3, 3).\nIf I go UP to (9, 6), to get to (3, 3), I have to go all the way left then down.\n(9, 6) -> (8, 6)... (0, 6) -> (0, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3).\nThat's much longer.\nSo (8, 5) is better for (3, 3).\n(3, 3) is an apple.\nIt is safer to get (3, 3) from (8, 5) than from (9, 6).\n\nWhat about (0, 5)?\nFrom (8, 5), go Left to (0, 5).\nFrom (9, 6), go Left to (0, 6), then Down to (0, 5).\n(8, 5) is better for (0, 5).\n\nWhat about (6, 7)?\nFrom (8, 5): (8, 5) -> (8, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7).\n4 moves.\nFrom (9, 6): (9, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7).\n4 moves.\nSame distance.\n\nWhat about (4, 9)?\nFrom (8, 5): (8, 5) -> (8, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (4, 7)? Blocked.\nNeed to go around. (4, 6) -> (3, 6) -> (3, 7) -> (3, 8) -> (3, 9) -> (4, 9).\nTotal ~9 moves.\nFrom (9, 6): (9, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (3, 6) -> (3, 7) -> (3, 8) -> (3, 9) -> (4, 9).\nTotal ~10 moves.\n(8, 5) is slightly better for (4, 9).\n\nSo (8, 5) is better or equal for all targets, and has more immediate options.\n\nWhy did I consider UP in the first place?\nBecause (9, 6) is \"up\" and apples are \"up\".\nBut (8, 5) is also \"up\" relative to the body, and allows me to go further up later.\n(8, 5) is strictly superior to (9, 6) in terms of flexibility and pathing.\n\nWait, check the \"Last Rationale\" from the prompt.\n\"My head is at (9, 4). My body is at (8, 4) and (8, 3).\"\nWait, the prompt says my body is [(9, 4), (8, 4)].\nHead: (9, 5).\nBody: (9, 4), (8, 4).\nSo the body goes (9, 5) -> (9, 4) -> (8, 4).\nSo the snake is L-shaped.\nIf I go UP to (9, 6), the body becomes (9, 5), (9, 4). The tail (8, 4) leaves.\nSo the snake becomes straight vertical: (9, 6) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4).\nIf I go LEFT to (8, 5), the body becomes (9, 5), (9, 4). The tail (8, 4) leaves.\nSo the snake becomes: (8, 5) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4).\nThis is an L-shape again.\n\nIf I go UP, I am straight. Straight snakes are generally safer in corners because they can't turn back into themselves easily.\nIf I go LEFT, I am bent. If I go LEFT again, I become (7, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (9, 5). Still bent.\nIf I go DOWN from (8, 5), I go to (8, 4).\n(8, 4) is currently empty.\nMy body is (9, 5), (9, 4).\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 4):\nNew head (8, 4).\nBody (8, 5), (9, 5).\nWait, (9, 4) is the tail currently.\nIf I move DOWN, the head moves to (8, 4).\nThe neck (9, 5) becomes body.\nThe tail (9, 4) moves to where the neck was? No, the tail follows the neck.\nCurrent: H(8,5), B1(9,5), B2(9,4).\nMove DOWN: H(8,4), B1(8,5), B2(9,5).\nThe tail B2(9,4) leaves.\nSo I am at (8, 4) -> (8, 5) -> (9, 5).\nThis is an L-shape.\nCan I go LEFT from (8, 4)? Yes, to (7, 4).\nCan I go DOWN from (8, 4)? Yes, to (8, 3).\nCan I go RIGHT from (8, 4)? To (9, 4). (9, 4) is currently empty (tail leaves).\nBut (9, 4) is occupied by my body? No, B2 is (9, 4). If I move, B2 leaves.\nSo (9, 4) becomes empty.\nSo I can move RIGHT to (9, 4).\nBut that is backwards (relative to previous move Left). Is that allowed?\n\"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n\"If you move directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head), you die.\"\nMy current head is (8, 5).\nThe cell behind my head is (9, 5).\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 4), the cell behind my head becomes (8, 5).\nSo I cannot immediately go UP (back to 8, 5).\nGoing RIGHT to (9, 4) is not backwards (it's diagonal relative to the body orientation).\n(9, 4) is currently occupied by the tail.\nIf I move to (9, 4), the tail is there.\nWait. The tail is at (9, 4).\nWhen I move DOWN to (8, 4):\n- Head moves to (8, 4).\n- Old head (8, 5) becomes body.\n- Old body (9, 5) becomes body.\n- Old tail (9, 4) moves away. It moves to (9, 5)? No, it follows the body.\nWait, the tail is the last segment. It always moves to the position of the previous segment.\nCurrent: (8, 5) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4).\nThe segment at (9, 4) is the tail.\nThe segment at (9, 5) is the \"parent\" of the tail.\nIf I move HEAD (8, 5) to (8, 4):\n- New Head (8, 4).\n- Segment (8, 5) becomes new body part. It now connects to (8, 4).\n- Segment (9, 5) connects to (8, 5).\n- Segment (9, 4) connects to (9, 5).\nSo the new body is (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 4).\nWait, the snake grows? No, unless I eat an apple.\nI am not eating an apple.\nSo the tail (9, 4) must leave its spot to maintain length.\nThe tail moves to the position of the previous segment (9, 5).\nBut (9, 5) is now occupied by the middle segment.\nSo the tail (9, 4) moves to (9, 5).\nBut (9, 5) is occupied by the segment that just moved there from (8, 5)?\nNo.\nLet's look at the movement algorithm.\n1. Head moves to new position.\n2. All other segments shift to the position of the previous segment.\n3. If no apple, the tail segment is removed.\nSo:\nStart: [ (8,5), (9,5), (9,4) ]\nMove DOWN to (8, 4).\nNew Head: (8, 4).\nShift:\n(8, 5) moves to (8, 4) -> No, the old head moves to where the head was.\nActually:\nNew Head: (8, 4).\nOld Head (8, 5) becomes the first body segment.\nOld Body (9, 5) becomes the second body segment.\nOld Tail (9, 4) is dropped.\nSo New Body: [ (8, 5), (9, 5) ].\nSnake: [ (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 5) ].\nThis forms a vertical line at X=8 and X=9.\nCan I go LEFT from (8, 4)? Yes, (7, 4).\nCan I go DOWN from (8, 4)? Yes, (8, 3).\nCan I go RIGHT from (8, 4)? Yes, (9, 4).\n(9, 4) is currently empty because the tail left.\nSo (9, 4) is safe.\nIs (9, 4) occupied by the body?\nThe body is (8, 5), (9, 5).\n(9, 4) is not in the body.\nSo I can go RIGHT to (9, 4).\nHowever, moving RIGHT from (8, 4) to (9, 4) means I am moving towards the body.\nIf I go to (9, 4), my body is (8, 4), (8, 5), (9, 5). Wait.\nIf I am at (9, 4):\nHead (9, 4).\nBody (8, 4), (8, 5).\nThis looks safe.\nBut note that (9, 5) is not in the body anymore. It was the tail, then dropped.\nWait, if I go DOWN to (8, 4), the body is (8, 5), (9, 5).\nSo (9, 4) is empty.\nSo yes, I can go RIGHT to (9, 4).\nThis is effectively \"wiggling\" back.\n\nThe point is, (8, 5) gives me:\n- LEFT to (7, 5)\n- UP to (8, 6)\n- DOWN to (8, 4)\n\n(9, 6) gives me:\n- LEFT to (8, 6)\n- UP to (9, 7)\n\n(8, 5) has 3 options. (9, 6) has 2.\n(8, 5) allows me to access (8, 4) which is the start of the path to (3, 3) and other bottom apples.\n(9, 6) puts me in a corner.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy.\nIf I am at (8, 5), and the enemy is at (2, 8).\nIf the enemy moves aggressively towards the center, it might try to cut me off.\nBut the enemy is far away.\n\nI will choose LEFT.\n\nWait, let's check the apples again.\n(0, 5) is an apple.\n(3, 3) is an apple.\nThese are reachable via LEFT.\n(6, 7) is an apple.\n(4, 9) is an apple.\n(1, 9) is an apple.\nThese are reachable via UP.\n\nIf I go LEFT, I will likely collect (0, 5).\nIf I go UP, I will likely collect (6, 7).\n(0, 5) is \"free\" (safe). (6, 7) is contested.\nGiven I am behind, I need safe points.\n(0, 5) is safe.\n(3, 3) is safe (far from enemy).\n(1, 9) is safe? It's close to enemy. Enemy is at (2, 8). (1, 9) is distance 2. Enemy can get it in 2 moves.\nSo I should get (0, 5) and (3, 3).\nThen I have 4 apples.\nEnemy has 3.\nThen I can try to get (6, 7) or (1, 9).\n\nSo LEFT seems like the plan.\n\nFinal check on safety.\nMove LEFT to (8, 5).\nIs (8, 5) occupied? No.\nIs it off board? No.\nIs it into my body?\nMy body is (9, 4), (8, 4).\n(8, 5) is not (9, 4) or (8, 4).\nIs it backwards?\nBackwards is (10, 5) or (9, 4)? No.\nBackwards is the cell I just came from (9, 5). (8, 5) is left, not backwards.\nSo it's safe.\n\nEnemy collision?\nEnemy moves to (2, 9), (2, 7), (1, 8).\nNone of these are (8, 5).\nSo safe.\n\nDecision: LEFT.\n\nWait, I should double check the \"Last Move\" rationale in the prompt.\nThe prompt says: \"My head is at (9, 4). My body is at (8, 4) and (8, 3).\"\nWait, the board state says:\nRow 5: `... 1` at (9, 5).\nRow 4: `... T T` at (8, 4) and (9, 4).\nSo Head (9, 5), Body (9, 4), (8, 4).\nThe rationale text says: \"My head is at (9, 4). My body is at (8, 4) and (8, 3).\"\nThis contradicts the board state and the turn number (Turn 10).\nWait, the prompt says: \"Your snake (ID: 1): - Head: (9, 5) - Body: [(9, 4), (8, 4)]\"\nSo the board and the text description agree on Head (9, 5), Body (9, 4), (8, 4).\nThe \"Last Move Rationale\" text is probably from a previous example or error in the prompt template, or it describes a state *before* the current turn.\nBut the current state is explicitly given in the \"Your snake\" section and the board.\nI must trust the \"Your snake\" section: Head (9, 5), Body [(9, 4), (8, 4)].\n\nSo my logic based on (9, 5) is correct.\n\nOne final consideration: The enemy has 3 apples. I have 2.\nIf I don't make a move to gain an apple soon, the enemy might win.\nThe safest apple is (0, 5).\nThe nearest apple is (6, 7).\n(6, 7) is contested.\n(0, 5) is safe.\nI will go for (0, 5).\nThis requires moving LEFT.\n\nWait, if I go LEFT, I move from (9, 5) to (8, 5).\nThis moves me AWAY from (6, 7) and TOWARDS (0, 5).\nThis aligns with my plan.\n\nWhat if I go DOWN?\nNo, (9, 4) is body.\n\nWhat if I go UP?\nI move towards (6, 7).\nIf I go UP, I might be able to get (6, 7) before the enemy.\nBut the enemy is closer to (4, 9) and (1, 9).\nIf I race for (6, 7), I might end up empty-handed if the enemy blocks me or takes other apples.\nGiven I am behind, I should take the guaranteed points.\n(0, 5) is guaranteed if I just walk to it.\n(6, 7) is not guaranteed.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n\nOne last check: Is there any possibility of head-on collision?\nIf the enemy moves LEFT, it goes to (1, 8).\nIf the enemy moves UP, it goes to (2, 9).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN, it goes to (2, 7).\nNone of these are (8, 5).\nSo no head-on collision.\n\nI am confident in LEFT.\n\nWait, let me look at the \"Rule\" again.\n\"Among the moves that keep you alive, prefer moves that both:\n  * increase your chance of safely eating apples, and\n  * keep future options open (avoid getting trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends).\"\n\nLEFT moves me towards an apple.\nLEFT opens up the board (row 5 is empty).\nLEFT avoids the corner.\nLEFT is good.\n\nI will write the plan.\nPlan: Move Left to approach the apple at (0, 5). This is a safe, uncontested point. Avoid the upper right corner to maintain flexibility.\n\nMove: LEFT.\n\nDouble check the output format.\n\"LEFT\"\nMust be the last line.\nNo other text after it.\nI will put the plan and reasoning before it.\n\nWait, I need to be careful about the \"Last Rationale\" part.\n\"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nAnd \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\n\nOkay.\n\nOne thought: The enemy has 3 apples. I have 2.\nIf the enemy gets one more apple, it has 4.\nI need to catch up.\nIf I go LEFT, I get (0, 5) -> 3 apples.\nThen I need one more to tie.\nIf I go UP, I get (6, 7) -> 3 apples.\nSame result.\nBut LEFT is safer.\n\nIs there any way the enemy can reach (8, 5)?\nNo.\nIs there any way the enemy can reach (9, 6)?\nNo.\n\nSo both are safe.\nBut LEFT is strategically better for the \"low risk\" approach.\n\nActually, let's look at the \"Long-term Plan\" in the prompt's example.\n\"Long-term Plan: Move UP towards the northern apples... Avoid getting trapped in the bottom right corner.\"\nThe example moved UP to avoid the bottom right corner.\nMy current position is (9, 5).\nIf I go DOWN, I go into the bottom right corner.\nIf I go RIGHT, I die.\nIf I go UP, I go towards the top right corner.\nIf I go LEFT, I go into the open board.\nThe example said \"Avoid getting trapped in the bottom right corner\".\nIf I go UP, I am moving towards the top right corner.\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving AWAY from the corners.\nSo the example's logic (avoid corners) actually supports LEFT more than UP!\nThe example moved UP because it was at (9, 4) and the only safe moves were UP and DOWN. It chose UP over DOWN because DOWN was a tighter corner.\nHere, I have UP and LEFT.\nLEFT is strictly better than UP for avoiding corners.\nSo I should choose LEFT.\n\nI am ready.\n\nReasoning:\n1. Safe moves are UP and LEFT.\n2. LEFT is safer for long term (more space, less cornered).\n3. LEFT moves towards a safe apple (0, 5).\n4. LEFT is the optimal choice.\n\nMove: LEFT.\n\nI will write the responseMy head is at (9, 5). My body is at (9, 4) and (8, 4).\nPossible moves:\n- **LEFT to (8, 5)**: Empty.\n- **UP to (9, 6)**: Empty.\n- **DOWN to (9, 4)**: Occupied by my own body. **DEADLY**.\n- **RIGHT to (10, 5)**: Outside the board. **DEADLY**.\n\n**Safety Check:**\n- Enemy #0 Head at (2, 8). Body at [(3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7)].\n- Potential heads: (8, 5) and (9, 6).\n- The enemy can only move UP, DOWN, or LEFT (cannot move right into its own neck).\n- None of the enemy's possible heads reach (8, 5) or (9, 6).\n- No head-on collision is possible this turn.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- **Moving LEFT to (8, 5)**: This moves me towards the open board (Row 5 is completely empty). It sets up a safe path to the uncontested apple at (0, 5) and the accessible apple at (3, 3). It maintains flexibility, allowing me to go DOWN to (8, 4) or UP to (8, 6) in the future. This is the safest option that leads to guaranteed scoring.\n- **Moving UP to (9, 6)**: This puts me in the top-right corner. While it is closer to the apples at (6, 7) and (4, 9), those are closer to the enemy and potentially contested. It limits my immediate options to LEFT and UP.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI am trailing the enemy by 1 apple (2 vs 3). I need to score safely to catch up. Moving LEFT secures the safe apple at (0, 5) and keeps me out of the corner, maximizing my chances of survival and future scoring opportunities.\n\nLEFT",

Wait, (0,9) is empty. But usually, they can't move into own neck. The neck is (2,9).

Identify lethal moves**  \n- **LEFT** would move the head onto (0,5), which is currently our own body segment right behind the head \u2192 instant death.  \n- All other directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) keep the head on empty cells.\n\n**2. Check collisions with other snakes**  \n- Enemy #1 can only move to (5,8) (DOWN) or (4,9) (LEFT). None of these cells are (1,6), (1,4), or (2,5).  \n- No head\u2011on collision is possible with any safe move.\n\n**3. Evaluate apple proximity**  \n- **UP** \u2192 distance to (4,9) improves, but distances to the lower apples increase.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 distances to (3,3) and (4,3) improve, but we move away from the high\u2011up apple (4,9).  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 improves distance to (3,3), (4,3) and (4,9) while keeping us roughly centered for future vertical moves.\n\n**4. Future option count**  \n- After **UP**, only two safe follow\u2011up directions remain (UP, RIGHT).  \n- After **DOWN** or **RIGHT**, three safe follow\u2011up directions remain (DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT or UP/RIGHT/DOWN respectively).  \n- More open options mean a larger \u201cfuture\u2011move buffer\u201d and less risk of getting trapped.\n\n**5. Preference**  \n- Both DOWN and RIGHT are safe and keep three future options, but **RIGHT** moves us closer to the cluster of apples at (3,3) and (4,3) and opens a clear path to the right side of the board, where we can later head upward toward (4,9).  \n- This direction therefore combines better apple\u2011reach prospects with the richest set of subsequent moves.\n\n**Conclusion:** The optimal safe move is **RIGHT**.\n\nRIGHT",

Body: [(4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8)].\n*   **Objective:** Survive and eventually collect the apple at (3, 3).\n*   **Movement Analysis:**\n    *   **UP (3, 10):** Illegal.

It keeps me on the board and moves me away from the immediate body block at (4, 9). Moving down opens up the board and allows me to navigate around my own body to eventually head South towards the apples. Since I am at the top edge of the board, I must move down to stay in the game.\n    *   **LEFT (2, 9):** This move is also safe. However, moving left into the corner (x=0) limits future movement options (only Down or Right). It is safer to keep Open space to my Left (x > 0) if possible. Moving Down keeps the Left option open.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**DOWN** is the best move. It avoids immediate death and positions me to maneuver around my body to head towards the apples at (3, 3) and (5, 2). Moving DOWN keeps my future options more open than moving LEFT into the wall.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nNavigate around my own body to head South.

Moving backwards into my own body results in death. **DEADLY**.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 7):** Row 7 is empty based on the board state. **SAFE**.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 8):** Row 8, column 2 is empty. **SAFE**.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 8):** Row 8, column 4 is empty. **SAFE**.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n-   **Goal:** The apple at (3, 3) is the closest primary target.\n-   **Body Blockage:** My body currently blocks the path from (3, 8) to the right side of the board (columns 4-6). To eventually move East towards the apple at (5, 2), I need to navigate around my own tail.\n-   **Move Options:**\n    -   **DOWN (3, 7):** Moves closer to the target apple at (3, 3) and (5, 2). It also avoids potential conflicts with the enemy snake at (3, 4) in the short term. It is the most direct path to where I want to go.\n    -   **LEFT (2, 8):** Moves away from the target apples and potentially into a corner.\n    -   **RIGHT (4, 8):** This seems like a good idea to get under my body, but looking ahead, my body currently occupies (4, 9) and (5, 9). If I go to (4, 8), my tail will eventually move to fill (4, 9). However, right now, (4, 8) is safe. But the enemy snake at (3, 4) is moving. If it moves UP to (3, 5), it will be closer. I should proceed carefully. Moving DOWN is the safest and most efficient move to approach the apple cluster.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI will move **DOWN** to (3, 7). This keeps me on the path towards the apples at the bottom of the board while maintaining safety from my own body.\n\nDOWN",

No head-on collision risk.\n    *   **Head-to-Body:**\n        *   If Enemy moves **DOWN to (3,2)** or **RIGHT to (4,3)**: They will not intersect with my potential path.\n        *   If I move **DOWN to (3,6)**: My head will not enter any of the Enemy's potential target cells. However, the Enemy's current body segment at (3,4) will remain there.\n        *   *Wait, let's re-read the board.* The Enemy is at (3,3) with body at (3,4). If I go **DOWN to (3,6)**, I am 2 squares away from their body. If they go **DOWN to (3,2)**, they move further away.\n        *   *Critical Check:* My potential moves are (3,6), (2,7), (4,7). The Enemy's potential moves are (3,2), (2,3), (4,3).\n        *   There is no intersection between my potential heads and their potential heads.\n        *   There is no intersection between my potential heads and their current body (3,4).\n        *   There is no intersection between their potential heads and my current body (3,8, 3,9, 4,9, 5,9).\n\n3.  **Strategic Analysis:**\n    *   **Target:** The closest apples are (5, 7) (distance 1 East) and (3, 2) (distance 5 South).\n    *   **Option 1 (RIGHT to 4, 7):** This moves adjacent to the apple at (5, 7). I can eat it next turn (Turn 23). However, my tail is at (5, 9). If I eat the apple, I don't shrink. My body stays. Moving Right to (4,7) puts me right next to (5,7). But if I move to (4,7), my body shifts to (3,7), (3,8), etc. This looks safe.\n    *   **Option 2 (DOWN to 3, 6):** This is a safe move that moves towards the lower apples.\n    *   **Option 3 (LEFT to 2, 7):** This moves away from the apples.\n\n    **Refined Decision:**\n    The enemy snake is at (3,3). It is likely to move towards the apple at (3,2) or (4,3).\n    My head is at (3,7).\n    If I go **RIGHT to (4,7)**, I am setting up to eat the apple at (5,7) next turn. This is a high-value move.\n    Let's verify safety of **RIGHT**.\n    Target: (4,7).\n    Is (4,7) clear? Yes.\n    Is moving there safe from the enemy?\n    Enemy potential positions: (3,2), (2,3), (4,3). No overlap.\n    Is moving there safe from myself?\n    My body: (3,8), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9). No overlap.\n    \n    Let's check **DOWN to (3,6)**.\n    Target: (3,6).\n    Is (3,6) clear? Yes.\n    Enemy potential positions: (3,2), (2,3), (4,3). No overlap.\n    Is moving there safe from myself? Yes.\n    \n    Comparison:\n    **RIGHT** moves me 1 step closer to the apple at (5,7) (distance 1 -> 0).\n    **DOWN** moves me 1 step closer to the apple at (3,2).\n    Since the apple at (5,7) is right next to me (currently distance 2, after RIGHT distance 1), it is the most immediate opportunity.\n    \n    However, wait. The apple at (5,7) is at (5,7). My head is at (3,7). Distance is 2.\n    If I move RIGHT to (4,7), distance becomes 1.\n    If I move DOWN to (3,6), distance to (5,7) becomes Sqrt((5-3)^2 + (7-6)^2) = Sqrt(4+1)=2.24. It doesn't get closer to that specific apple.\n    If I move DOWN to (3,6), distance to (3,2) becomes 4 (was 5). I get closer to the lower cluster.\n    \n    Let's look at the board again.\n    ` 7 . . . 1 . A . . . .`\n    The apple at (5,7) is right there.\n    Moving **RIGHT** is the best immediate move to secure that apple.\n    \n    Let's double check the body constraint.\n    If I move RIGHT to (4,7):\n    New Body: [(3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9)].\n    The tail at (5,9) stays. This is valid because I didn't eat an apple yet (I haven't reached one).\n    If I eat an apple on the *next* turn (Turn 23), the tail will stay, and I will grow.\n    \n    Is there any risk?\n    Enemy at (3,3).\n    If Enemy moves UP (dies), DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n    None of those intersect (4,7).\n    \n    So, RIGHT is safe and strategically optimal for the next immediate step.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (4,7). This positions me adjacent to the apple at (5,7). On the next turn (Turn 23), I will move RIGHT again to (5,7) to eat the apple. This scores a point and extends my length. After eating, I will have to be careful about my body length, but getting points is the priority.\n\nRIGHT",

It secures a guaranteed point by eating an apple immediately. The safety check confirms that the enemy cannot intercept me or block me this turn. Eating the apple will extend my body length, so I will need to be mindful of my tail in future turns, but the score lead is critical.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\nEat the apple at (5,7) by moving RIGHT. After growing, my body will extend. On the next turn, I will likely need to move DOWN or UP to navigate around my new body length or continue exploring for the next apple.

The enemy is currently at (4, 2) and will likely move to eat one of the apples at (3, 2) or (5, 2).\n        *   Apple at (3, 2): Distance 4 (via DOWN/LEFT/LEFT). The enemy is adjacent to this.\n        *   Apple at (7, 5): Distance roughly 5 (via RIGHT/RIGHT/DOWN/DOWN). This is open space.\n        *   Apple at (7, 9): Distance roughly 5 (via RIGHT/RIGHT/UP/UP). This is open space but near the top wall.\n    *   **Risk Assessment:**\n        *   **Moving DOWN (5, 6):** This moves me towards the lower apples, but it puts me closer to the enemy's potential path. Since the enemy is eating at the bottom cluster (likely), moving there invites conflict.\n        *   **Moving UP (5, 8):** This moves towards the top apples. The board at the top right (near 7, 9) is relatively open. This avoids the enemy and secures a future path to the (7, 9) apple.\n        *   **Moving RIGHT (6, 7):** This moves horizontally towards the (7, 5) and (7, 9) apples. It is a safe lateral move.\n    *   **Decision:**\n        *   **UP** is a strong move. It opens the path to the apple at (7, 9) and avoids the enemy. However, looking at the board, (5, 7) is far from (7, 9).\n        *   **RIGHT** is a strong move. It brings me closer to the apples at (7, 5) and (7, 9) and keeps me in a central lane (y=7) allowing flexibility.\n        *   Let's compare **UP** vs **RIGHT**. Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 7) aligns my x-coordinate with the apple at (7, 5). From there, I can go DOWN to (6, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 5). This seems efficient.\n        *   Let's look at the apple at (7, 9). Moving **UP** to (5, 8) is the first step. Then (5,9) -> (6,9) -> (7,9). Also efficient.\n        *   However, the enemy is at y=2. I am at y=7. If I go UP, I am moving away from the enemy and towards the open top-right quadrant. If I go RIGHT, I stay at y=7, which is in the middle of the board.\n        *   The apple at (7, 5) is \"low\" but not as low as the enemy. The apple at (7, 9) is \"high\".\n        *   Actually, looking at the board state provided in the prompt:\n            ```\n             9 . . . T T . . A . .\n             8 . . . T . . . . . .\n             7 . . . T T 1 . . . .\n            ```\n            My head is at (5, 7). If I go **UP** to (5, 8), I am immediately next to the wall at (4, 8) (which is T from my body or enemy? No, T is my tail/body). Wait, looking at the diagram: (4, 8) is empty ('.'). (5, 8) is empty.\n            If I go **RIGHT** to (6, 7), I move into open space.\n            If I go **DOWN** to (5, 6), I move into open space.\n        *   The apple at (7, 5) is accessible via RIGHT->RIGHT->DOWN->DOWN. The apple at (7, 9) is accessible via UP->UP->RIGHT->RIGHT.\n        *   The enemy is at (4, 2). They will eat (3, 2) or (5, 2). They are not a threat to me right now.\n        *   **Priority:** Secure the apple at (7, 9). It is in the corner and safer than the center.\n        *   Wait, looking at the board again:\n            ` 9 . . . T T . . A . .`\n            The 'A' at (7, 9) is blocked by 'T' at (3,9) and (4,9) which are my tail. My head is at (5,7). My body runs up to (3,9). The space at (5, 8) and (5, 9) is open.\n            If I go **UP** to (5, 8), I am setting up for (5, 9) -> (6, 9) -> (7, 9).\n            If I go **RIGHT** to (6, 7), I am setting up for (7, 7) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 5).\n        *   Let's check safety of **UP**: (5, 8) is empty.\n        *   Let's check safety of **RIGHT**: (6, 7) is empty.\n        *   Let's check safety of **DOWN**: (5, 6) is empty.\n        *   Let's check **LEFT**: (4, 7) is occupied by my body. **DEADLY**.\n        *   Between UP, DOWN, and RIGHT:\n            *   **DOWN** moves me towards the enemy's area (y=2). This is risky long-term because the enemy is there and will grow.\n            *   **RIGHT** moves me to the middle-right.\n            *   **UP** moves me to the top-right.\n        *   The apple at (7, 9) is a \"corner\" apple. Usually, getting corner apples is good because they are hard to contest later. The apple at (7, 5) is in the open.\n        *   Also, if I go UP, I increase my Y. My body is currently at Y=7, 8, 9. If I go UP, I hit (5, 8). My tail is at (4, 9). The body connects (4,9) -> (3,9) -> (3,8) -> (3,7) -> (4,7) -> (5,7).\n            If I go UP to (5, 8):\n            New Head: (5, 8).\n            New Body: (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9).\n            Wait, the tail (4, 9) moves to (3, 9)? No, the tail moves off if no apple eaten. If I don't eat, the tail is removed.\n            So if I go UP:\n            Head: (5, 8)\n            Body: [(5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)].\n            This is valid.\n        *   If I go RIGHT:\n            Head: (6, 7)\n            Body: [(5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)].\n            This is valid.\n        *   If I go DOWN:\n            Head: (5, 6)\n            Body: [(5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9)].\n            This is valid.\n        *   **Decision:** I want the apple at (7, 9). I should move UP.\n        *   Wait, is there an apple closer? The apple at (7, 5) is closer in Manhattan distance from (5, 7) than (7, 9).\n            (7, 5) is distance |7-5| + |5-7| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n            (7, 9) is distance |7-5| + |9-7| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n            Distance is equal.\n        *   Which is safer?\n            (7, 5) is on row 5. The enemy is on row 2.\n            (7, 9) is on row 9 (top). The enemy is far away.\n            However, (7, 5) is more central.\n            Let's look at the board layout again.\n            There is an 'A' at (7, 5).\n            There is an 'A' at (7, 9).\n            If I go **UP**, I approach the top. My body is already forming a block on the left side (x=3). Moving UP clears the bottom area and heads to the top.\n            If I go **DOWN**, I enter the area where the enemy might eventually go.\n            If I go **RIGHT**, I go towards the middle. From there I can choose UP or DOWN later.\n            Let's check the \"long-term plan\".\n            *Plan:* Target the apple at (7, 9) because it is isolated and safe from the enemy who is at the bottom. Move UP now to align.\n\n    *   **Final Choice:**\n        *   **UP** moves me towards the apple at (7, 9).\n        *   **RIGHT** moves me towards the apple at (7, 5).\n        *   **DOWN** moves me towards the apples at (5, 2) and (3, 2), but the enemy is currently at (4, 2) and will likely eat those.\n        *   The enemy is likely to move **LEFT** (to 3, 2) or **RIGHT** (to 5, 2). If the enemy goes to (5, 2), then (5, 6) is still safe.\n        *   However, the enemy is currently at (4, 2). If I go DOWN to (5, 6), I am moving closer to the conflict zone.\n        *   If I go UP to (5, 8), I am moving away.\n        *   Also, looking at my body: (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9). If I go UP to (5, 8), I am at (5, 8). My body is at (3, 7)... (3, 9). I am clear of my own body.\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (6, 7), I am at (6, 7). My body is at (3, 7)...\n        *   If I go DOWN to (5, 6), I am at (5, 6). My body is at (3, 7)...\n        *   All are safe.\n        *   Let's look at the enemy's potential moves again.\n            Enemy at (4, 2).\n            Safe moves: DOWN (4, 1), LEFT (3, 2), RIGHT (5, 2).\n            UP (4, 3) is deadly (hitting own body).\n            The enemy will eat an apple.\n            If I want to survive and win, I need to eat apples that the enemy *isn't* eating, or that are far away.\n            The enemy is eating at the bottom (3,2) or (5,2).\n            The apple at (7, 5) and (7, 9) are safe from the enemy right now.\n            I prefer the top apple (7, 9) because it's a corner.\n            So, I will move UP.\n\n    *   **Wait, re-evaluating the \"Backwards\" rule.**\n        *   My head is at (5, 7). My previous head was (4, 7). So (4, 7) is the direction I came from.\n        *   Moving **LEFT** is backwards. That is deadly.\n        *   Moving UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n        *   I will choose **UP** to pursue the (7, 9) apple.\n\n    *   **Wait, one check on the apple at (7, 5).**\n        *   The apple at (7, 5) is close. If I go RIGHT (6, 7), I am 1 step closer to (7, 5).\n        *   If I go UP (5, 8), I am 1 step closer to (7, 9).\n        *   Is there any reason to prefer (7, 5)? It's on row 5. It's closer to the center.\n        *   Is there any reason to prefer (7, 9)? It's on row 9 (top). It's safer from the enemy (who is at row 2).\n        *   Also, going UP puts me at (5, 8). From there I can go RIGHT to (6, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (7, 9) or (6, 9) -> (7, 9).\n        *   Going RIGHT puts me at (6, 7). From there I can go DOWN to (6, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 5).\n        *   Let's look at the board state again.\n            Row 8: ` . . . T . . . . . .`\n            Row 7: ` . . . T T 1 . . . .`\n            If I go UP to (5, 8), I am entering Row 8.\n            Row 8: ` . . . T . 1 . . . .` (Wait, my head moves to 5,8).\n            The 'T' at (3, 8) is my body.\n            The space around (5, 8) is open.\n            This seems like a valid move.\n            Actually, wait. Row 7 has `T T 1` at columns 3, 4, 5.\n            Row 8 has `T` at column 3.\n            If I go UP to (5, 8), I am safe.\n            If I go DOWN to (5, 6), I am on Row 6. Row 6 is empty.\n            If I go RIGHT to (6, 7), I am on Row 7. Row 7 is empty at column 6.\n\n            Let's look at the apples again.\n            (9, 0) - Bottom right. Very far.\n            (5, 2) - Bottom center. Enemy target.\n            (3, 2) - Bottom center. Enemy target.\n            (7, 5) - Middle right.\n            (7, 9) - Top right.\n\n            Enemy is at (4, 2).\n            If enemy goes LEFT to (3, 2), they eat apple.\n            If enemy goes RIGHT to (5, 2), they eat apple.\n            If enemy goes DOWN to (4, 1), they don't eat.\n            It is highly probable the enemy eats an apple this turn.\n            If the enemy eats, they grow. This makes them more dangerous.\n            I should maximize my distance from the enemy.\n            Moving UP (to y=8) increases distance from enemy (y=2).\n            Moving RIGHT (to x=6, y=7) increases x distance slightly but keeps y=7.\n            Moving DOWN (to y=6) decreases distance from enemy.\n            So, UP or RIGHT are good. DOWN is less good.\n            Between UP and RIGHT:\n            The apple at (7, 9) is \"in the corner\". Usually, it's good to claim corners.\n            The apple at (7, 5) is in the open.\n            I will go UP.\n\n    *   **Wait, is there an apple at (5, 7)?** No, I ate it last turn.\n    *   **Is there an apple at (4, 7)?** No.\n    *   **Is there an apple at (5, 8)?** No.\n    *   **Is there an apple at (5, 6)?** No.\n    *   **Is there an apple at (6, 7)?** No.\n    *   **Conclusion:** I am moving towards the cluster at the top right.\n\n    *   **One final check:**\n        *   If I move **UP (5, 8)**.\n        *   If Enemy moves **LEFT (3, 2)**.\n        *   If Enemy moves **RIGHT (5, 2)**.\n        *   No collision.\n        *   My path to (7, 9) is open.\n        *   My path to (7, 5) is open (via DOWN later).\n        *   Moving UP is safe and strategic.\n\n    *   **Why not RIGHT?**\n        *   Moving RIGHT puts me closer to the center.\n        *   Moving UP puts me closer to the top.\n        *   The enemy is at the bottom.\n        *   I have the top right to myself (mostly).\n        *   I will take the top right apple (7, 9).\n\n    *   **Why not DOWN?**\n        *   I am currently at (5, 7).\n        *   My tail is at (4, 9).\n        *   If I go DOWN to (5, 6), I am moving towards the enemy.\n        *   If I go DOWN, I might get cut off later.\n        *   I will not go DOWN.\n\n    *   **Final Decision:** UP.\n\n    *   **Wait, let me check the board state image again carefully.**\n        ` 9 . . .

Yes, it's on the path to (7, 9).\n        Is there any other constraint?\n        \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself\".\n        Backwards is (4, 7). That is blocked.\n        All other moves are valid.\n        UP is the best move to secure the top apple.\n\n    *   **Alternative thought:** The apple at (7, 5) is arguably easier to reach?\n        From (5, 7) -> (6, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 5).\n        That's 4 moves.\n        From (5, 7) -> (5, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (7, 9). Or (5, 8) -> (5, 9) -> (6, 9) -> (7, 9). 4 moves.\n        Distance is identical.\n        However, the apple at (7, 5) is on row 5. The enemy starts at y=2. The enemy will likely stay low.\n        The apple at (7, 9) is on row 9. The enemy cannot reach it easily.\n        It is safer to go for the high apple.\n        Also, the top of the board is \"safer\" generally because you have fewer directions you can die from (only 3 directions instead of 4, though the wall kills you anyway).\n        I will go UP.\n\n    *   **Wait, I should check if I can trap myself.**\n        *   My body is currently at: (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9).\n        *   If I go UP to (5, 8), my body becomes: (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9).\n        *   Where can I go from (5, 8)?\n            *   (5, 9): Open.\n            *   (6, 8): Open.\n            *   (4, 8): Open.\n            *   (5, 7): My body.\n        *   From (5, 9):\n            *   (5, 8): My body.\n            *   (6, 9): Open.\n            *   (4, 9): My body (old tail).\n        *   From (6, 8):\n            *   (6, 9): Open.\n            *   (7, 8): Open.\n            *   (6, 7): Open.\n            *   (5, 8): My body.\n        *   The path is open. I will not be trapped.\n\n    *   **Final check on the Enemy.**\n        *   Enemy Head: (4, 2).\n        *   Enemy Body: (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (0, 5).\n        *   My Head: (5, 7).\n        *   My Body: (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9).\n        *   If I go UP (5, 8), I am far away.\n        *   If Enemy goes UP (4, 3), they hit their own body. They won't do that.\n        *   If Enemy goes DOWN (4, 1), they are safe.\n        *   If Enemy goes LEFT (3, 2), they eat apple.\n        *   If Enemy goes RIGHT (5, 2), they eat apple.\n        *   There is no interaction.\n\n    *   **Strategy:** Go UP. Target the apple at (7, 9). It's safer than (7, 5) because it's away from the enemy.\n\n    *   **Wait, let's look at the apples one last time.**\n        Apples: (9, 0), (5, 2), (3, 2), (7, 5), (7, 9).\n        Enemy is at (4, 2).\n        Enemy can eat (3, 2) or (5, 2).\n        I am at (5, 7).\n        I can eat (7, 5) or (7, 9).\n        (7, 9) is \"top right\". (7, 5) is \"middle right\".\n        Top right is usually a better position.\n        I will go UP.\n\n    *   **One edge case:**\n        *   My head: (5, 7).\n        *   If I go UP: (5, 8).\n        *   Is (5, 8) occupied? No.\n        *   Is it backwards? No.\n        *   Is it a wall? No.\n        *   Is it a body? No.\n        *   Is it an enemy head? No.\n        *   It is SAFE.\n        *   It is STRATEGIC.\n\n    *   **Wait, I see an Apple at (7, 5).**\n        *   If I go RIGHT now, I get closer to (7, 5).\n        *   If I go UP now, I get closer to (7, 9).\n        *   The enemy is at y=2. The enemy is likely to stay at y=2 or go down.\n        *   If the enemy stays low, the bottom half of the board is contested.\n        *   I should take the top half.\n        *   So UP is the correct move to secure territory.\n\n    *   **Wait, what if the enemy goes UP?**\n        *   Enemy goes UP to (4, 3). But (4, 3) is its own body.\n        *   So enemy cannot go UP.\n        *   So enemy is stuck on y=2 or y=1 (down).\n        *   This confirms the bottom is contested.\n        *   I must go UP.\n\n    *   **Wait, the body of the enemy at (4, 3) moves.**\n        *   If Enemy goes LEFT to (3, 2), its body becomes:\n            *   Head: (3, 2)\n            *   Seg 1: (4, 2)\n            *   Seg 2: (4, 3)\n            *   Seg 3: (3, 3)\n            *   ...\n        *   So the space at (4, 3) becomes free (as the body moves).\n        *   But the head is still at (3, 2) or (5, 2).\n        *   The enemy is still low.\n        *   My move UP is safe and good.\n\n    *   **Final Plan:**\n        1. Move UP to (5, 8).\n        2. Target apple at (7, 9).\n        3. Avoid the bottom where the enemy is.\n\n    *   **Double check:**\n        My head (5, 7).\n        Move UP -> (5, 8).\n        Is (5, 8) safe?\n        Board state:\n        Row 8: ` . . .

Potential moves (4, 1), (3, 2), (5, 2).\n        (5, 8) is not one of those.\n        So UP is safe.\n\n    *   **Alternative consideration:**\n        Is there any move that is safer or better?\n        RIGHT (6, 7).\n        DOWN (5, 6).\n        UP (5, 8).\n        UP is the only one moving towards the top apple (7, 9).\n        RIGHT moves towards (7, 5).\n        DOWN moves towards the enemy.\n        UP is the best.\n\n    *   **Wait, is there an apple at (5, 2)?**\n        Yes.\n        Is it reachable by the enemy?\n        Enemy is at (4, 2). Yes.\n        Will the enemy eat it?\n        Probably.\n        I should not go there.\n\n    *   **Is there an apple at (3, 2)?**\n        Yes.\n        Enemy is at (4, 2). Yes.\n        Will the enemy eat it?\n        Probably.\n        I should not go there.\n\n    *   **Conclusion:**\n        The enemy is fighting for the bottom apples.\n        I should take the top apples.\n        Move UP.\n\n    *   **Wait, I just realized something.**\n        The enemy is at (4, 2).\n        If the enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 2), it eats the apple.\n        If the enemy moves LEFT to (3, 2), it eats the apple.\n        If the enemy moves DOWN to (4, 1), it doesn't eat.\n        Given the score (Snake 0 has 7 apples, I have 5), the enemy wants to score.\n        The enemy will almost certainly move to an apple.\n        This leaves the bottom \"contested\".\n        I am at (5, 7).\n        If I move DOWN, I enter the contested zone.\n        If I move UP, I leave the contested zone.\n        UP is definitely the right direction.\n\n    *   **Final check on the \"backwards\" rule.**\n        \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself\".\n        My head is at (5, 7).\n        My body is at (4, 7).\n        Moving LEFT puts me at (4, 7).\n        That is backwards.\n        That is deadly.\n        I must not move LEFT.\n\n    *   **Final check on boundaries.**\n        Board size 10x10.

No overlap.\n\n    *   **Okay, UP.**\n\n    *   **Wait, I need to check \"Head-to-Body\" for me.**\n        If I move to (5, 8), will I hit my body?\n        My body: (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9).\n        (5, 8) is not in the list.\n        Okay.\n\n    *   **Wait, I need to check \"Head-to-Body\" for me (future state).**\n        Wait, the rule says \"If you move into a snake's body, you die\".\n        This implies checking the board *before* the move.\n        But usually in Snake, you also check the tail *if it moves*.\n        However, standard rules: If the tail moves away, the spot becomes free.\n        But I must check the spot I am moving to *before* the move.\n        If the tail is at (4, 9), and I move to (4, 9), I die *unless* the tail moves away this turn.\n        However, in this game, \"If you move onto an apple... you grow\".\n        If I don't eat, the tail moves.\n        So if I move to a spot that is the tail, and the tail moves away, I survive.\n        But if I move to a spot that is the tail, and I eat an apple (so tail doesn't move), I die.\n        In this case:\n        My target (5, 8).\n        My tail is (4, 9).\n        (5, 8) is not the tail.\n        So I am safe regardless.\n\n    *   **Okay, UP.**\n\n    *   **Wait, is there any other consideration?**\n        I am currently at (5, 7).\n        My body is at (4, 7).\n        Moving LEFT is backwards.\n        Moving UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n        I prefer UP to get the top apple.\n        I prefer UP to avoid the enemy at the bottom.\n        I prefer UP to get to the corner.\n\n    *   **Okay, UP.**\n\n    *   **Wait, is the enemy snake ID 0?**\n        Yes.\n        Head (4, 2).\n        Body ...\n        I am ID 1.\n        Head (5, 7).\n        Body ...\n\n    *   **Okay, UP.**\n\n    *   **Wait, I need to write the rationale.**\n        It should be clear.\n        The enemy is at the bottom.\n        I am at the top.\n        I should move UP to secure the top apples.\n        The apple at (7, 9) is the target.\n        I should move UP to (5, 8).\n        This is safe.\n\n    *   **Okay, UP.**\n\n    *   **Wait, what if the board state is wrong?**\n        The prompt provides the board state.\n        I must trust it.\n        It says row 8 is `. . . T . . . . . .`\n        So (5, 8) is empty.\n\n    *   **Okay, UP.**\n\n    *   **Wait, I will double check the \"Backwards\" rule.**\n        \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself\".\n        My head is at (5, 7).\n        The segment behind it is (4, 7).\n        Moving LEFT goes to (4, 7).\n        That is backwards.\n        That is death.\n        I will not move LEFT.\n\n    *   **Okay, UP.**\n\n    *   **Wait, is there an apple at (5, 8)?** No.\n    *   **Wait, is there an apple at (6, 7)?** No.\n    *   **Wait, is there an apple at (5, 6)?** No.\n    *   **Wait, is there an apple at (4, 8)?** No.\n    *   **Wait, is there an apple at (6, 8)?** No.\n    *   **Wait, is there an apple at (5, 9)?** No.\n    *   **Wait, is there an apple at (6, 9)?** No.\n    *   **Wait, is there an apple at (7, 8)?** No.\n    *   **Wait, is there an apple at (7, 9)?** YES.\n    *   **Wait, is there an apple at (3, 2)?** YES.\n    *   **Wait, is there an apple at (5, 2)?** YES.\n    *   **Wait, is there an apple at (7, 5)?** YES.\n    *   **Wait, is there an apple at (9, 0)?** YES.\n\n    *   **Okay, I am ready.**\n        Rationale: Enemy is at bottom.

My body is at (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9). (5, 9) is **safe**. Is it backwards? Previous head was (5, 7). (5, 9) is UP two, so not backwards. Is it off-board? No (5, 9) is within bounds (0-9).\n    *   **Strategy:** This move continues the ascent towards the top-right corner. It positions me perfectly to eat the apple at (7, 9) in the following turns (Right, Right). The enemy is at (5, 2) and is focused on the lower apples ((5, 2) and (3, 2)). Moving UP keeps me in the \"top half\" territory, away from the enemy, and secures the high-value corner apple.\n\n*   **RIGHT (6, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** (6, 8) is empty. Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** This moves me horizontally. It is a valid move, but I am currently chasing the apple at (7, 9) specifically. Moving UP is the first step in the diagonal path to that apple. Moving RIGHT doesn't get me closer to the top apple, though it gets me closer to the center.\n\n*   **DOWN (5, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** (5, 7) is occupied by my own body (the segment immediately behind my head). **DEADLY.**\n\n*   **LEFT (4, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** (4, 8) is empty. Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** This moves me West (Left). I am currently trying to move East (Right) towards the (7, 9) apple. This would be a detour.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **UP** to (5, 9) is the optimal choice. It is safe, avoids the enemy's zone of influence at the bottom of the board, and is the first step towards eating the apple at (7, 9) in the top-right corner.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nHead towards the apple at (7, 9) to secure the top-right corner. Avoid moving down towards the center where the enemy (Snake 0) is active.\n\nUP",

Current State Analysis:**\n- **My Snake (ID 1):**\n  - Previous Head: (5, 9)\n  - Previous Body: [(5, 8), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8)]\n  - **New Head:** (5, 9)\n  - **New Body:** [(5, 8), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8)] (Tail moved from (3, 9))\n  - **Apples:** 5 (I didn't eat this turn).\n\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n  - Previous Head: (6, 2)\n  - Previous Body: [(5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5)]\n  - **Movement:** From (6, 2), with (5, 2) and (4, 2) occupied by its body, it had 2 safe moves: UP to (6, 3) or RIGHT to (7, 2). It could not go DOWN (off board) or LEFT (into itself).\n  - **Target:** The closest apple for Snake 0 is (3, 2).\n    - Distance from (6, 2) to (3, 2) is 3.\n    - **Path 1 (UP then LEFT):** (6, 2) -> (6, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (3, 3) ... (This is blocked by its own body at (4, 3)).\n    - **Path 2 (LEFT):** (6, 2) -> (5, 2) ... (Blocked by body).\n    - **Path 3 (RIGHT):** (6, 2) -> (7, 2) -> (6, 2) ... (Looping).\n    - Actually, looking at the board, (3, 2) is occupied by 'T' (from previous turn, but likely gone now). However, the gap between (6, 2) and (3, 2) is blocked by its own body at (5, 2), (4, 2), and (4, 3).\n    - **Crucial Observation:** Snake 0 is effectively cornered or trapped in the bottom-left quadrant. It has no path to the apple at (3, 2) without cutting off its own tail. It cannot reach the apples at (9, 0), (7, 5), or (2, 6).\n    - **Prediction:** Snake 0 will likely attempt to grow or escape. It might move UP to (6, 3) (if safe) or RIGHT to (7, 2). It will not be a threat to me in the top right corner.\n\n**2. Board State (Turn 27):**\n- My Head: (5, 9)\n- My Body: (5, 8), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8)\n- Apples: (9, 0), (3, 2), (7, 5), (7, 9), (2, 6)\n\n**3. Move Evaluation (from (5, 9)):**\n- **UP:** (5, 10) -> Off board. **DEAD.**\n- **DOWN:** (5, 8) -> Occupied by my own body. **DEAD.**\n- **LEFT:** (4, 9) -> Empty. **SAFE.**\n- **RIGHT:** (6, 9) -> Empty. **SAFE.**\n\n**4. Strategy (Next moves to Apple at (7, 9)):**\n- Target: (7, 9)\n- My Head: (5, 9)\n- I need to move RIGHT twice. (5, 9) -> (6, 9) -> (7, 9).\n- **LEFT** moves me away from the target. While (4, 9) is empty, moving there puts my head at (4, 9) and my body at (5, 9), (5, 8)... This might allow an escape route if I get trapped later, but I am currently in a very open area. The goal is to get the apple at (7, 9) before anyone else (though no one else is close).\n- **RIGHT** is the direct path.\n- **Long-term plan:** Move RIGHT to (6, 9) and then RIGHT to (7, 9) to eat the apple. This keeps me safe and gains a point. Snake 0 is irrelevant in the top right corner. I must avoid trapping myself in the top row (9), but I have the entire left side open if I need to retreat.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove RIGHT to get closer to the apple at (7, 9).\n\nRIGHT",

Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (7, 9) (Just moved here last turn to eat an apple).\n    *   Body: [(6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7)].\n    *   Length: 7.\n    *   **Constraint:** At (7, 9), I am trapped against the top wall and right wall. My only immediate body part is at (6, 9) (to the left). I must move DOWN or LEFT.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Previous Head: (7, 3).\n    *   Previous Body: [(6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)].\n    *   **Threat:** This snake is likely moving **UP** (towards y=4 or y=5) or **RIGHT** (towards x=8). If it moves UP, it occupies the left column (x=7). If it moves RIGHT, it moves closer to the center.\n*   **Board State (Turn 29):**\n    *   Apples: (2, 6), (3, 2), (8, 3).\n    *   Note: Apple at (9, 0) is too far in the corner, (7, 5) is blocked by my tail, (2, 6) is high value.\n\n**2. Move Evaluation (from (7, 9)):**\n*   **UP:** (7, 10) -> Off board. **DEAD.**\n*   **RIGHT:** (8, 9) -> Off board. **DEAD.**\n*   **DOWN:** (7, 8) -> Empty (based on board rendering of row 8). **SAFE.**\n    *   *Risk:* Snake #0 might move UP into (7, 3)->(7, 4)... eventually threatening this column. But not this turn.\n*   **LEFT:** (6, 9) -> Occupied by my body. **DEAD.**\n    *   *Wait:* Let's re-check the rules. \"Moving directly backwards... counts as hitting yourself.\" My tail is at (3, 7). The segment at (6, 9) is my \"neck\". Moving into the neck is indeed suicide.\n    *   *Correction:* Looking at the previous move, I moved from (6,9) to (7,9). So (6,9) is indeed the cell immediately behind my head. Moving there is illegal.\n    *   *Re-evaluating Board State:* Row 9 looks like `. . . . . T T 1 . .`. My head is at (7,9). My body is at (6,9), (5,9). The 'T' at (8,9) and (9,9) are walls. Wait, the map shows coordinates 0-9. (9,9) is top right. The board renders 10 columns. So x=9 is valid. The map says `9 . . . . . T T 1 . .` (indices 0-9). Let's look at the previous move rationale: It said I moved RIGHT from (6,9) to (7,9). So (6,9) is the previous position.\n    *   *Conflict:* The visual board shows `T T 1` at the end of row 9.\n        Indexes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n        The string `9 . . . . . T T 1 . .` has 11 characters including the coordinate label. Let's count the dots and T's.\n        `9` (label)\n        ` ` (sep)\n        `.` (0)\n        `.` (1)\n        `.` (2)\n        `.` (3)\n        `.` (4)\n        `.` (5)\n        `T` (6)\n        `T` (7)\n        `1` (8)\n        `.` (9)\n        `.` (??)\n        This implies the string is slightly misaligned or I am misinterpreting the string.\n        Let's look at the string: `9 . . . . . T T 1 . .`\n        If the string is strictly space-separated, the list is:\n        [9, ., ., ., ., ., T, T, 1, ., .]\n        There are 11 items. Coordinates are 0-9 (10 items).\n        Maybe the last `.` is extraneous? Or maybe the `1` is at index 8?\n        If `1` is at index 8, that is coordinate (8,9).\n        If `1` is at index 7, that is coordinate (7,9).\n        If `1` is at index 6, that is coordinate (6,9).\n\n        Let's look at the *previous* board state from the last turn prompt:\n        `9 . . . . . T T . . 1`\n        That board showed `1` at the very end (index 9 or 10?). That would be (9,9) or (10,9).\n        However, the previous move rationale said: \"My Head: (6, 9)\" and \"Apples: (7, 9) is directly to my right.\" and \"Move RIGHT to (7, 9)\".\n        So previous turn head was (6,9). I moved RIGHT.\n        Current turn head should be (7,9).\n        \n        Let's look at the *current* board: `9 . . . . . T T 1 . .`\n        If the `1` represents (7,9), then the cells are:\n        (0,9): .\n        (1,9): .\n        (2,9): .\n        (3,9): .\n        (4,9): .\n        (5,9): .  <- Wait, previous body was at (5,9).\n        (6,9): T  <- Wait, my body was at (6,9).\n        (7,9): T  <- Wait, (7,9) is an apple?\n        (8,9): 1\n        (9,9): .\n        \n        If `1` is at index 8, that is (8,9).\n        If `1` is at index 9, that is (9,9).\n        \n        Let's look at the \"My Snake\" text:\n        Head: (7, 9)\n        Body: [(6, 9), ...]\n        \n        So officially, my head IS at (7,9).\n        \n        Now, where are the walls?\n        The board shows `T T` before the `1`.\n        If `1` is at (7,9), then (5,9) and (6,9) are `T`? No, (6,9) is my body.\n        If `1` is at (8,9), then (6,9) and (7,9) are `T`. That means I am not at (7,9).\n        \n        **Discrepancy:** The text description says \"Head: (7, 9)\".\n        The board rendering is: `9 . . . . . T T 1 . .`\n        Let's try to parse the board again carefully.\n        `9` (Row Label)\n        `.` (0)\n        `.` (1)\n        `.` (2)\n        `.` (3)\n        `.` (4)\n        `T` (5)\n        `T` (6)\n        `1` (7)\n        `.` (8)\n        `.` (9)\n        Wait, there are only 10 columns of data after the label usually.\n        Let's count the characters: `9 . . . . . T T 1 . .`\n        Spaces included: `9` ` ` `.` ` ` `.` ` ` `.` ` ` `.` ` ` `.` ` ` `T` ` ` `T` ` ` `1` ` ` `.` ` ` `.` (22 chars).\n        This is confusing. Let's assume the text description of coordinates is the \"source of truth\".\n        \n        **Decision Logic:**\n        Text: Head (7,9).\n        Text: Body starts (6,9).\n        Last Move: I moved RIGHT.\n        So I was at (6,9) and moved to (7,9).\n        \n        Where are the walls in the text description?\n        \"Board state: 9 . . . . . T T 1 . .\"\n        Let's look at the *previous* turn's board state in the prompt history.\n        Previous Turn (Turn 28) Board: `9 . . . . . T T . . 1`\n        Previous Turn Text: Head (6,9).\n        \n        If Previous Turn Board `1` was at index 10 (assuming 11 chars) or index 9 (assuming 10 chars).\n        If `1` was at index 9, that was (9,9). But text said (6,9).\n        If `1` was at index 6, that was (6,9). Previous board: `9 . . . . . T T . . 1`. Counting indices 0-9.\n        Indices: 0:., 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:T, 7:T, 8:., 9:.\n        Where is the 1?\n        Maybe the `1` in the string is at a non-standard position.\n        Let's look at the map provided at the start: \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n        This implies X is horizontal, Y is vertical.\n        The board is printed with Y=9 at top.\n        Row 9: `9 . . . . . T T 1 . .`\n        \n        Let's look at the \"Enemy Snake\" text: Head (7,3).\n        Row 3 of the board: `3 . . . T T . T 0 A .`\n        Indices: 0:., 1:., 2:., 3:T, 4:T, 5:., 6:T, 7:0, 8:A, 9:.\n        Here, `0` is at index 7. That matches Head (7,3).\n        \n        So, the `1` at Row 9 should be at index 7 to match Head (7,9).\n        Row 9: `9 . . . . . T T 1 . .`\n        Indices: 0:., 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:., 6:T, 7:T, 8:1, 9:.\n        Wait, if `1` is at index 8, that is (8,9).\n        If `1` is at index 7, that is (7,9).\n        \n        Let's count the spaces in the string \"9 . . . . . T T 1 . .\"\n        If we split by space: ['9', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'T', 'T', '1', '.', '.']\n        This is 11 elements. Elements 1-10 are the board cells.\n        Element 1: index 0\n        Element 2: index 1\n        Element 3: index 2\n        Element 4: index 3\n        Element 5: index 4\n        Element 6: index 5\n        Element 7: index 6 (T)\n        Element 8: index 7 (T)\n        Element 9: index 8 (1)\n        Element 10: index 9 (.)\n        \n        So according to the visual, `1` is at index 8, which is coordinate (8,9).\n        But the text says `Head: (7, 9)`.\n        \n        **Hypothesis:** The visual board has a slight rendering offset or error, or the `T`s are actually my body segments (6,9) and maybe (5,9)? No, (5,9) is marked as `T` in the previous turn board, but my body is at (5,9).\n        \n        Let's trust the explicit coordinate list for my snake over the visual board if there is a conflict, BUT I must know where the walls are.\n        The visual board shows `T` at (5,9) and (6,9) on row 9.\n        My body is at (6,9) and (5,9).\n        So the `T`s in the top row (row 9) are likely my own body!\n        And the `1` is at (8,9)? Or (7,9)?\n        \n        If `1` is at (8,9):\n        Then my body is at (7,9)? No, text says (6,9).\n        \n        Let's re-read the previous turn rationale:\n        \"Current Head: (6, 9).\"\n        \"Board state: 9 . . . . .

T T . . 1`\n        Split: `9` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `T` `T` `.` `.` `1`\n        Indices 0-9:\n        0:.\n        1:.\n        2:.\n        3:.\n        4:.\n        5:.\n        6:T\n        7:T\n        8:.\n        9:.\n        (Extra `1` at end?)\n        \n        This is extremely confusing. Let's assume the text description of the *previous* move is correct:\n        \"Apples: (7, 9) is directly to my right.\" (From (6,9)).\n        \"Move RIGHT to (7, 9)\".\n        \n        Current Turn Text: \"Head: (7, 9)\".\n        \n        So I am definitely at (7,9).\n        \n        Now, where are the obstacles?\n        Current Visual Row 9: `9 . . . . . T T 1 . .`\n        If `1` is at (7,9), then indices are:\n        0:.\n        1:.\n        2:.\n        3:.\n        4:.\n        5:.\n        6:T\n        7:T\n        8:1  <-- Wait, `1` is the 9th item in the split list (0-indexed 8).\n        If `1` is index 8, coordinate is (8,9).\n        \n        **Conclusion:** There is a mismatch. I will trust the coordinate list \"Head: (7,9)\".\n        \n        Where are the walls?\n        The board shows `T` at positions 6 and 7 in the string.\n        If my head is at (7,9), and there is a `T` at index 7 in the string, that `T` must be me (the head).\n        If there is a `T` at index 6, that is (6,9), which is my body.\n        \n        So the visual string `T T 1` (if `1` is me) suggests:\n        (6,9): T (Body)\n        (7,9): T (Head?) or 1 (Head?)\n        \n        Usually, the head is marked '1' or '0'.\n        Enemy head is '0'.\n        My head is '1'.\n        \n        Let's look at the string again: `9 . . . . . T T 1 . .`\n        The characters are `T`, `T`, `1`.\n        This implies (6,9): T, (7,9): T, (8,9): 1.\n        But if (8,9) is 1, then my head is at (8,9).\n        If my head is at (8,9), my body is at (7,9) and (6,9).\n        Text says: Head (7,9). Body starts (6,9).\n        \n        **Possibility:** The text description of my body is `[(6, 9), (5, 9), ...]`. If my head is at (7,9), then the body follows.\n        \n        **Let's check Snake #0 visual alignment.**\n        Row 3: `3 . . . T T . T 0 A .`\n        Head text: (7,3).\n        Visual split: `3` `.` `.` `.` `T` `T` `.` `T` `0` `A` `.`\n        Indices 0-9:\n        0:.\n        1:.\n        2:.\n        3:T\n        4:T\n        5:.\n        6:T\n        7:0\n        8:A\n        9:.\n        So Snake #0 head '0' is at index 7, which is x=7.\n        This matches text \"Head: (7, 3)\".\n        \n        **Therefore, the visual indexing is reliable.**\n        \n        Now apply this to Row 9 for my snake:\n        Row 9: `9 . . . . . T T 1 . .`\n        Split: `9` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `T` `T` `1` `.` `.`\n        Indices 0-9:\n        0:.\n        1:.\n        2:.\n        3:.\n        4:.\n        5:.\n        6:T\n        7:T\n        8:1\n        9:.\n        \n        If `1` is at index 8, my head is at (8,9).\n        If `1` is at index 8, then (6,9) is index 6 (T), (7,9) is index 7 (T).\n        So my body is at (7,9) and (6,9).\n        \n        **Conflict:** Text says \"Head: (7, 9)\".\n        Visual says Head is at (8,9).\n        \n        **Which to trust?**\n        The text says \"My Snake (ID: 1): Head: (7, 9), Body: [(6, 9)...]\".\n        The visual board is just a representation.\n        However, usually in these games, the visual board is the \"ground truth\" for this turn's state.\n        \n        Let's check the *previous* turn's visual vs text.\n        Previous Turn Text: Head (6,9).\n        Previous Turn Visual: `9 . . . . . T T . . 1`\n        Split: `9` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `T` `T` `.` `.` `1`\n        Indices 0-9:\n        0:.\n        1:.\n        2:.\n        3:.\n        4:.\n        5:.\n        6:T\n        7:T\n        8:.\n        9:.\n        \n        Wait, previous visual had `1` at the end. Let's check the prompt again.\n        \"--Your last move information:--\"\n        ...\n        \"Board state:\n         9 . . . . . T T . . 1\"\n        \n        If `1` is at the end of the string `9 . . . . . T T . . 1`, and we use the split logic:\n        `9` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `T` `T` `.` `.` `1`\n        Index 9 is `1`.\n        So previous turn visual said head was at (9,9).\n        Previous turn text said head was at (6,9).\n        \n        **Huge Discrepancy.**\n        \n        Wait, looking closely at the *previous* turn visual in the prompt provided to me:\n        \"Board state:\n         9 . . . . . T T . . 1\n         8 . . . . . T . . . .\n         ...\"\n        \n        And the previous rationale said: \"Apples: (7, 9) is directly to my right.\" (From (6,9)).\n        \n        If I was at (6,9), and moved RIGHT to (7,9), I ate the apple at (7,9).\n        \n        Current visual: `9 . . . . . T T 1 . .`\n        If I am now at (7,9), and (6,9) is my body (T).\n        The visual shows `T` at index 6, `T` at index 7, `1` at index 8.\n        \n        If I am at (7,9), the `1` should be at index 7.\n        But it is at index 8.\n        \n        **Maybe the string has an extra space or formatting error?**\n        \"9 . . . . . T T 1 . .\" (10 data items? Or 11?)\n        Let's count: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n        If we remove the row label '9':\n        `. . . . . . T T 1 . .`\n        That is 11 items.\n        If we remove the last item (it's a dot):\n        `. . . . . .

T T . . 1`\n        If the `1` is at the very end of the string, it might be index 10 or index 9.\n        \n        Let's assume the text description \"Head: (7, 9)\" is the correct current state.\n        And \"Last Move: RIGHT\" (from (6,9)).\n        \n        **Strategy:**\n        If I am at (7,9), looking at the visual for obstacles.\n        The visual shows `T` at (6,9) and (7,9) (indices 6 and 7).\n        If I am at (7,9), then (7,9) is occupied by me (Head).\n        (6,9) is occupied by my body.\n        (8,9) is `1` in the visual, but maybe that's a visual artifact of the head?\n        \n        Let's assume the visual `1` is just showing my head, and it is at (7,9).\n        Why does it look like it's at index 8?\n        Maybe the dots are not all equal length?\n        \"9 . . . . . T T 1 . .\"\n        \n        Okay, let's try to interpret the visual board strictly as 10 columns.\n        The prompt says: \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n        The board is 10x10.\n        \n        I will trust the text coordinates: Head (7,9).\n        \n        **Where can I go?**\n        My Head: (7,9).\n        My Body: (6,9), (5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7).\n        \n        Moves from (7,9):\n        *   **UP:** (7, 10) -> Off board. **DEAD.**\n        *   **RIGHT:** (8, 9) -> Is this empty?\n            *   Visual: `9 . . . . .

T T . 1` (10 items).\n        \n        Let's assume the text \"Head: (7,9)\" is the ground truth.\n        \n        **Targeting:**\n        Apples:\n        (9, 0) - Bottom Right\n        (3, 2) - Bottom Left\n        (7, 5) - Middle\n        (2, 6) - Left Middle\n        (8, 3) - Center Right\n        \n        From (7,9), I can go RIGHT to (8,9) or DOWN to (7,8).\n        \n        **Snake #0 Prediction:**\n        Head: (7,3).\n        Body: [(6,3), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)].\n        This snake is mostly in column 3, 4, 5, 6.\n        It is likely moving UP towards the apples at (7,5) or (8,3).\n        If it moves UP, it will go to (7,4) or (7,5).\n        \n        **My Moves:**\n        1.  **RIGHT to (8,9):**\n            *   Safe?\n            *   Visual: `1 . .` (assuming `1` is at 8).\n            *   If I move RIGHT, I go to (8,9).\n            *   Is (8,9) empty?

To get to (8,3), it needs to go RIGHT.\n        If it goes RIGHT, it takes 1 move.\n        \n        So Snake #0 can easily beat me to (8,3).\n        \n        **What about (2,6)?**\n        I would have to go LEFT.\n        But I can't go LEFT (backwards into body).\n        So I have to go DOWN first, then LEFT.\n        \n        **Strategy:**\n        I am trapped in the top right corner.\n        I need to get out of the corner.\n        Going RIGHT to (8,9) puts me closer to the wall.\n        Going DOWN to (7,8) moves me towards the center, but into the column Snake #0 is likely claiming.\n        \n        However, if I go DOWN to (7,8), I can turn LEFT to (6,8) next turn (if (6,8) is empty, which it is).\n        Wait, if I go DOWN to (7,8), my body is (7,9), (6,9), ...\n        Next turn, I can go LEFT to (6,8).\n        (6,8) is empty.\n        \n        If I go RIGHT to (8,9), my body is (7,9), (6,9)...\n        Next turn, I can go DOWN to (8,8).\n        (8,8) is empty.\n        \n        **Comparing \"Getting out of the corner\":**\n        *   **RIGHT:** Moves deeper into the corner (x=8). But opens up the \"bottom-right\" path.\n        *   **DOWN:** Moves out of the corner (x=7). But stays in the column Snake #0 is in.\n        \n        **Long Term Plan:**\n        I need to survive and find apples.\n        The apples at (2,6) and (3,2) are on the left.\n        The apples at (9,0) and (8,3) are on the right.\n        \n        If I go RIGHT, I am committing to the right side.\n        If I go DOWN, I can eventually turn LEFT and go towards (2,6).\n        \n        Let's look at the board again.\n        Row 7: `7 . . . T T T . . . .`\n        Indices 3, 4, 5 are T.\n        This is likely part of the board structure or Snake #0's body extension?\n        Snake #0 body: ..., (3,5), (2,5).\n        Row 5: `5 . . . T . . . A . .`\n        (3,5) is T. (4,5) is . (wait, board says `T . .`).\n        Let's check Snake #0 body again.\n        Body: [(6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)]\n        So (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,3).\n        This is a loop on the left.\n        The `T T T` at row 7 (indices 3,4,5) is NOT Snake #0.\n        Wait, Row 7: `7 . . . T T T . . . .`\n        This `T T T` is at (3,7), (4,7), (5,7).\n        My body is: (3,7), (4,7), (5,7).\n        Yes! My body occupies those spots.\n        \n        So I am safe to move DOWN or RIGHT.\n        \n        **Decision:**\n        I am at (7,9).\n        Snake #0 is at (7,3).\n        If I go DOWN, I move towards Snake #0.\n        If I go RIGHT, I move away.\n        \n        However, if I go DOWN, I can turn LEFT into the empty space at (6,8) on the next turn, effectively moving into the \"main\" board area.\n        If I go RIGHT, I am stuck on the right edge for one more turn.\n        \n        But wait, if I go DOWN to (7,8), I might collide with Snake #0 if it moves UP aggressively? No, it's at y=3.\n        \n        Let's look at the \"Long Term Plan\" in the prompt history.\n        It said: \"Next Turn: The tail will move from (3, 8) to (3, 7), leaving (3, 8) empty. I should turn DOWN to (7, 8) to avoid getting stuck at the right wall.\"\n        \n        Wait, the history says I *should* turn DOWN to (7,8).\n        But I am at (7,9).\n        To turn DOWN, I must move DOWN.\n        \n        However, the history says \"Target: Apple at (7, 9). Current Head: (6, 9).\" (This was previous turn).\n        \n        So the *previous* plan was to eat the apple at (7,9) and then turn DOWN.\n        I have eaten the apple. Now I am at (7,9).\n        So the plan says \"Next Turn... turn DOWN to (7, 8)\".\n        \n        So I should move DOWN.\n        \n        Is that safe?\n        (7,8) is empty.\n        Is it smart?\n        Yes, it avoids the wall.\n        \n        Why would I go RIGHT?\n        If I go RIGHT, I go to (8,9).\n        Is there an apple there? No.\n        Am I closer to (8,3)? Yes, but Snake #0 is closer.\n        \n        If I go DOWN:\n        I go to (7,8).\n        I can then go LEFT to (6,8) or DOWN to (7,7).\n        (6,8) is empty.\n        \n        **Is there any threat to going DOWN?**\n        Snake #0 is at (7,3). It's very far.\n        \n        **Is there any threat to going RIGHT?**\n        Visual board shows `T` at (6,9) and (7,9) (indices 6, 7). (8,9) is `.`.\n        If I am at (7,9), then (7,9) is head.\n        (8,9) is empty.\n        \n        **Why did the previous rationale say \"turn DOWN\"?**\n        \"I should turn DOWN to (7, 8) to avoid getting stuck at the right wall.\"\n        This implies staying on the right wall (moving RIGHT) is bad.\n        \n        So, I will follow the plan and move DOWN.\n        \n        Wait, let me double check the \"Visual\" one more time to ensure (7,8) is empty.\n        Row 8: `8 . . . . . T . . . .`\n        Indices: 0:., 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:., 5:T, 6:., 7:., 8:., 9:.\n        Wait, `T` is at index 5.\n        That corresponds to (5,8).\n        My body is at (5,8). Correct.\n        (7,8) is index 7.\n        Value is `.`.\n        So (7,8) is empty.\n        \n        So DOWN is safe and follows the plan.\n        \n        What about LEFT?\n        Left is (6,9). Visual shows `T` (index 6).\n        Text says body is at (6,9).\n        So LEFT is into my own body. DEAD.\n        \n        UP is off board. DEAD.\n        \n        So choices are DOWN or RIGHT.\n        \n        RIGHT puts me at (8,9).\n        Visual: (8,9) is `.` (index 8).\n        So RIGHT is safe.\n        \n        But the plan says DOWN.\n        \"I should turn DOWN to (7, 8) to avoid getting stuck at the right wall.\"\n        \n        If I go RIGHT to (8,9), I am one step closer to the right wall.\n        Next turn I could go DOWN to (8,8) or RIGHT (dead).\n        If I go DOWN to (7,8), I can go LEFT to (6,8) or DOWN.\n        \n        Moving to (7,8) gives me more options (Left, Down) and moves me towards the center.\n        Moving to (8,9) gives me fewer options (Down, Left).\n        \n        So DOWN is the better strategic move.\n        \n        **Final Check:**\n        My Head: (7,9).\n        Move: DOWN.\n        New Head: (7,8).\n        Is (7,8) empty? Yes.\n        Is (7,8) within bounds? Yes.\n        Am I moving into my own body? No.\n        \n        I will move DOWN.\n        \n        Wait, I need to consider the Enemy Snake #0 one more time.\n        Snake #0 Head: (7,3).\n        If Snake #0 moves UP, it goes to (7,4).\n        If I move DOWN, I go to (7,8).\n        We are 4 cells apart (y=4 vs y=8).\n        No collision risk this turn.\n        \n        Okay, DOWN is safe.\n        \n        **One edge case:**\n        If I am at (7,9) and I move DOWN to (7,8), and Snake #0 is at (7,3) and moves UP to (7,4).\n        That's fine.\n        \n        What if Snake #0 moves UP to (7,4) AND I move DOWN to (7,8)?\n        No collision.\n        \n        What if Snake #0 moves UP to (7,4) AND I move DOWN to (7,8)?\n        Distance is (7,8) and (7,4).\n        \n        Okay.\n        \n        I will move DOWN.\n        \n        Wait, the prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\n        \n        I'm choosing DOWN.\n        \n        **Wait, let me re-read the prompt's \"My last move information\" just to be absolutely sure about my location.**\n        \"My Snake (ID: 1):\n         - Head: (7, 9)\"\n        \n        Okay, I am definitely at (7,9).\n        \n        Board State:\n         9 . . . . .

Moving DOWN is safe and opens up the path to the left side of the board. Moving RIGHT keeps me trapped at the wall.

Current State Analysis:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   Head: (7, 9)\n    *   Body: [(6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7)]\n    *   I am at the top edge of the board. My only available moves are DOWN and RIGHT, as UP is off the board and LEFT is into my own body (backwards into the neck at (6,9)).\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head: (7, 3)\n    *   Body: [(6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)]\n    *   Snake #0 is currently located in column 7 (x=7). It is very likely to move UP towards the apple at (7,5).\n\n**2. Move Evaluation:**\n*   **RIGHT:** Moves to (8, 9). This is safe but keeps me pinned against the right wall. It limits my future movement options.\n*   **DOWN:** Moves to (7, 8). This is safe (based on the board rendering showing (7,8) as empty). This moves me toward the center of the board and opens up a path to move LEFT on the next turn, which is crucial for accessing the central apples and avoiding the column occupied by Snake #0.\n\n**3. Strategy:**\nMoving DOWN is the strictly superior option. It avoids getting trapped in the corner and allows me to turn LEFT next turn to exit column 7. Since Snake #0 is occupying column 7, staying in that column risks a future collision if we both move vertically.\n\nDOWN",

My body occupies `(7, 8)` and `(7, 9)`. Directly behind my head (backwards) is `(7, 6)`, which is currently empty on the board.\n3.  **Enemy Intent:** Snake #0 is at `(8, 4)`. It is likely to target the apple at `(9, 0)` (down and right), or the apple at `(7, 5)` (up and left). Given its proximity, moving towards `(7, 5)` is a significant possibility, which would put its head at `(7, 5)` or `(8, 5)`.\n4.  **Move Evaluation:**\n    *   **UP:** Moves to `(7, 8)`. This is occupied by my own body. **DEAD**.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Moves to `(8, 7)`. This is a valid move, but it puts me adjacent to Snake #0's potential path and is not the most efficient route to the nearby apple at `(7, 5)`.\n    *   **DOWN:** Moves to `(7, 6)`. This is a valid move. However, keeping my x-coordinate at 7 keeps me in the column that Snake #0 is highly likely to cross or inhabit. If Snake #0 moves UP to `(8, 5)` or `(7, 5)`, staying in this column increases the risk of a corner or head-on collision on subsequent turns.\n    *   **LEFT:** Moves to `(6, 7)`. This is a valid move. It moves me out of the central column and away from the likely path of Snake #0. It creates space between my body and me for future turning. It is the safest and most strategic move to secure the apple at `(7, 5)` without risking immediate interception.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **LEFT** to `(6, 7)` is the best option. It avoids my body, avoids the high-traffic column of the enemy snake, and positions me to hunt the nearby apple safely.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "My previous move was LEFT to (6, 7). This was a good move as it moved me away from the enemy and towards the apple at (7, 5) while keeping the option to go to (5, 7) open. Now, I'm at (6, 7) and need to decide my next move. The board state is as follows:\nMy snake (ID 1): Head at (6, 7), Body at [(7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7)].\nEnemy snake (ID 0): Head at (8, 5), Body at [(8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3)].\nApples: (9, 0), (3, 2), (7, 5), (2, 6), (8, 6).\n\nLet's evaluate the possible moves from (6, 7):\n1.  **UP to (6, 8)**: This is empty. It keeps me in the same x-column but moves up. However, looking at the board, (6, 8) is safe. It doesn't immediately get me an apple, but it doesn't hit anything.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 6)**: This is empty. This moves me closer to the apple at (7, 5) (distance decreases from sqrt(2) to 1). It is also the move suggested in the previous turn's plan. However, (6, 6) is adjacent to the column where Snake #0 is active.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 7)**: This is occupied by my own body (specifically, the tail end or a body segment). Looking at the body list: (5, 7) is the last element (tail). Wait, let's re-read the board. My body is [(7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7)]. So (5, 7) is indeed part of my body. Moving here would kill me.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 7)**: This is occupied by my own body (the segment right behind my previous head position). This is also a suicide move.\n\nSo, the only safe moves are UP and DOWN.\n\nNow consider the enemy snake #0 at (8, 5).\nIts possible moves are:\n- UP to (8, 6). There is an apple at (8, 6). If it takes it, it grows and stays at (8, 6).\n- DOWN to (8, 4). This is its current body segment, so it dies.\n- LEFT to (7, 5). There is an apple at (7, 5). If it takes it, it grows and stays at (7, 5).\n- RIGHT to (9, 5). Empty.\n\nIt is very likely to go UP or LEFT to eat an apple. If it goes UP, it goes to (8, 6). If it goes LEFT, it goes to (7, 5).\n\nMy current position is (6, 7). I want the apple at (7, 5).\nMy distance to (7, 5) is 2 steps (diagonal).\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 6), I am at distance 1.\nIf I go UP to (6, 8), I am at distance 3.\n\nI want to get the apple at (7, 5). But I must avoid Snake #0.\nIf Snake #0 moves LEFT to (7, 5), it will eat the apple. I cannot prevent that. If that happens, I should avoid moving into (7, 5) or getting cornered by the now-grown snake.\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (8, 6), it eats the apple there and becomes longer. It might then move towards (7, 5) or (9, 0).\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nMy position: (6, 7).\nTarget: (7, 5).\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN.\n- If I move DOWN to (6, 6):\n  - I am at (6, 6).\n  - If Snake #0 moves LEFT to (7, 5), it is at (7, 5). I am at (6, 6). We are adjacent. If I want to eat the apple at (7, 5) next, I can't because Snake #0 is there (and likely growing). I would have to go around.\n  - If Snake #0 moves UP to (8, 6), it is at (8, 6). I am at (6, 6).\n  - If I go DOWN to (6, 6), I am approaching the apple (7, 5), but also moving towards the \"battle zone\" where Snake #0 is active.\n- If I move UP to (6, 8):\n  - I am at (6, 8).\n  - This moves me away from the apple at (7, 5). Why would I do this?\n  - The only reason to go UP is to avoid danger at (6, 6).\n  - Let's analyze danger at (6, 6).\n  - Snake #0 at (8, 5).\n  - If Snake #0 goes LEFT to (7, 5), it is safe.\n  - Is there any way Snake #0 can hit me at (6, 6)? No, unless it predicts my move to (6, 6) and moves to (6, 6) too. It can't move 2 steps.\n  - However, if I move to (6, 6), and Snake #0 moves to (7, 5), I am right next to it. If Snake #0 then moves to (6, 5) or (6, 6) next turn, I die.\n  - But if I go UP to (6, 8), I give up ground on the apple (7, 5).\n  - Is there any other apple?\n  - (2, 6) is to the left. (3, 2) is down and left. (9, 0) is down and right.\n\nWait, let's re-read the board state carefully.\n\"Board state:\n 9 . . . . . T T T . .\n 8 . . . . . T . T . .\n 7 . . . . . T 1 T . .\n 6 . . A . . . . . A .\n 5 . . . . . . . A 0 .\n 4 . . . . . . . . T .\n 3 . . . T T . T T T .\n 2 . . . A T T T . . .\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n 0 . . . . . . . . . A\"\n\nMy head is at (6, 7). My body is at (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), etc.\nSnake #0 head is at (8, 5). Body extends to (8, 4), etc.\n\nApple at (7, 5).\nApple at (8, 6).\nApple at (9, 0).\nApple at (3, 2).\nApple at (2, 6).\n\nConsider the move **DOWN to (6, 6)**.\nThis puts me at (6, 6).\nFrom (6, 6), I can go to (7, 5) next (eating the apple) or (6, 5), etc.\nIf Snake #0 goes to (7, 5), I cannot eat it.\nIf Snake #0 goes to (8, 6), I am safe.\n\nConsider the move **UP to (6, 8)**.\nThis puts me at (6, 8).\nFrom (6, 8), I can go to (6, 9) (my body), (5, 8) (my body), (7, 8) (my body). Wait, (7, 8) is my body.\nActually, from (6, 8):\n- UP to (6, 9) -> My body is at (6, 9). Dead.\n- DOWN to (6, 7) -> Safe (previous pos).\n- LEFT to (5, 8) -> My body is at (5, 8). Dead.\n- RIGHT to (7, 8) -> My body is at (7, 8). Dead.\n\nSo, if I move UP to (6, 8), I will have **NO** safe moves on the next turn. I would be completely surrounded by my own body. I would die on the following turn (turn 33) no matter what.\n\nTherefore, **UP is a trap**. It leads to a dead end.\n\nI must move **DOWN to (6, 6)**.\nLet's double check (6, 6) for safety.\nMy body: (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7).\n(6, 6) is empty.\nMy tail is at (5, 7). I am moving my head to (6, 6). On the next turn, the tail will likely move (unless I eat an apple).\nSo (6, 6) is safe.\n\nIs there any collision with Snake #0?\nSnake #0 is at (8, 5).\nI am at (6, 6).\nSnake #0's range of movement:\n- If it goes to (7, 5), we are adjacent but not colliding (distance is 1.4).\n- If it goes to (8, 6), we are distance 2.\n- It cannot reach (6, 6) in one move.\n\nSo, moving DOWN is the only move that keeps me alive and allows me to play the next turn.\n\nThe apple at (7, 5) is the closest.\nIf Snake #0 moves LEFT to (7, 5), it eats it. If it does, I will need to find another target, likely (2, 6) or (3, 2).\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (8, 6), it eats that apple. Then I can still go for (7, 5).\n\nI must move DOWN.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove DOWN to (6, 6). Assess Snake #0's move.\n- If Snake #0 takes (7, 5), I will likely need to retreat and plan a path to (2, 6) or (3, 2).\n- If Snake #0 takes (8, 6), I will move to (7, 5) on the next turn.\n\nThis move is forced to avoid suicide on turn 33.\n\nDOWN\nDOWN",

Moving UP puts the head into the position currently occupied by the second segment of the body. In Snake games, the body segments move one step to fill the void left by the head, but the new head position immediately becomes part of the body. Since (6, 6) is occupied by the body right now, moving into it is a collision with self. Additionally, the segment at (6, 5) becomes the new \"neck\". If I were to move UP to (6, 6) and then try to move DOWN immediately next turn, I would be moving back into my neck (6, 5), which is a standard backward-move death. Thus, this move is suicidal. **Unsafe.**\n\n2.  **LEFT to (5, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Check board at (5, 5). The board shows `.` (empty).\n    *   **Body:** Is (5, 5) in the body list `[(6, 6), (6, 7), ...]`? No.\n    *   **Walls:** x=5 is within [0,9].\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (7, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Check board at (7, 5). The board shows `A` (Apple).\n    *   **Body:** Is (7, 5) in the body list? No (Body ends at (5, 9)).\n    *   **Walls:** x=7 is within [0,9].\n    *   **Result:** Safe and eats an apple.\n\n4.  **DOWN to (6, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Check board at (6, 4). The board shows `.` (empty).\n    *   **Body:** Is (6, 4) in the body list? No.\n    *   **Walls:** y=4 is within [0,9].\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n\n**Comparison of Safe Moves:**\n*   **LEFT (5, 5):** Moves towards the left side of the board. It is safe but moves away from the immediate apple at (7, 5).\n*   **RIGHT (7, 5):** Moves directly onto an apple. Eating the apple will cause the snake to grow. The tail will not move forward this turn. The current tail is at (5, 9). The body segment currently at (6, 9) will move to (5, 9), the one at (7, 9) to (6, 9), and so on. The snake currently at (7, 5) will effectively become a permanent body segment because the chain is long enough that the tail won't vacate any space needed for the head to reach (7, 5). Checking the path: Head moves to (7, 5). Neck becomes (6, 5). Next segment moves to (6, 6). This fits the chain. Since I'm eating, the tail stays at (5, 9). This move maximizes score and positions me closer to other apples (like (7, 5) is eaten, but I'm near (9, 0) and (8, 7) is currently occupied by enemy head).\n*   **DOWN (6, 4):** Moves to an empty square. Safe, but no points.\n\n**Strategy & Risk:**\nEnemy snake #0 is at (8, 7). My head is at (6, 5). If I move RIGHT to (7, 5), I am eating an apple and moving closer to the enemy. However, the enemy is currently facing possible moves. If the enemy moves DOWN or LEFT, they might collide. If they move UP to (8, 8) or RIGHT to (9, 7), they are safe.\n\nHowever, the prompt's \"Last Move Rationale\" suggests a fear of getting trapped and a desire to eat the apple at (7, 5). Specifically, it says: \"From there, if the enemy snake moves to (8, 6) to eat the apple, I will attempt to take the apple at (7, 5).\" This implies that taking (7, 5) is a valid goal.\n\nLet's check the \"Last Move Information\" provided in the prompt:\n\"My previous move was UP to (6, 7), leaving me at (6, 7). ... Thus, my only viable survival move this turn is DOWN. I will move to (6, 6).\"\n\nWait, the prompt states the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" was **DOWN**.\nThis means the user *intended* to go DOWN.\nHowever, looking at the current state:\nHead is at (6, 5).\nBody is `[(6, 6), (6, 7), ...]`.\nIf the previous move was UP to (6, 7), then the head was at (6, 7).\nThe body list currently shows the head would have been at (6, 5) previously to result in (6, 6) being the new body start? No.\nLet's re-read the current state carefully.\n\"My previous move was UP to (6, 7)\" -> This implies the head was at (6, 6) or similar.\nCurrent Head: (6, 5).\nCurrent Body: `[(6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)]`\n\nWait, if the head is at (6, 5), and the body list is `(6, 6), (6, 7)...`, then the snake looks like this:\n... (6, 9) -> (5, 9) is tail.\n(6, 9) <- (7, 9) <- (7, 8) <- (7, 7) <- (6, 7) <- (6, 6) <- (6, 5) [Head].\n\nThe \"Last Move Rationale\" claims the user moved UP to (6, 7).\nIf the user moved UP from (6, 6) to (6, 7), then the old head was (6, 6), old body started at (6, 7).\nBut the current state shows head at (6, 5).\nThis implies the user *did not* follow their own plan in the history, or the history provided is slightly mismatched with the current board state visualization, or I am misinterpreting the turn flow.\n\nLet's look at the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" again. It says **DOWN**.\nSo the user *chose* DOWN.\nIf the user chose DOWN from where they were, and ended up at (6, 5), then they must have been at (6, 6) before.\nSo:\nOld Head: (6, 6)\nOld Body start: (6, 7)\nResult of moving DOWN: New Head (6, 5).\nNew Body start: Old Head (6, 6).\nThis matches the current board state perfectly: Head (6, 5), Body `[(6, 6), (6, 7), ...]`.\n\nSo, the user moved DOWN to get to (6, 5). The \"Rationale\" text saying \"I will move to (6, 6)\" is likely a typo in the prompt, or referring to the destination of a *previous* turn, but the \"PICK\" line says DOWN, and the resulting state is consistent with moving DOWN from (6, 6) to (6, 5).\n\nCurrent Situation Analysis:\nHead: (6, 5).\nAvailable moves:\n- UP: (6, 6). Occupied by body (current index 1). **DEATH**.\n- DOWN: (6, 4). Empty. **SAFE**.\n- LEFT: (5, 5). Empty. **SAFE**.\n- RIGHT: (7, 5). Apple. **SAFE**.\n\nI must not move UP.\n\nBetween LEFT, DOWN, and RIGHT:\n- Moving RIGHT (7, 5) gets an apple. I currently have 7 apples. Snake #0 has 10. I need to catch up.\n- Moving RIGHT moves me closer to Snake #0 (at 8,7), but also towards the wall at x=9.\n- Moving LEFT (5, 5) moves towards the center/left, away from the immediate danger of Snake #0 and towards the apple at (2, 6).\n- Moving DOWN (6, 4) moves towards the bottom, empty space.\n\nGiven the \"Long-Term Plan\" in the prompt explicitly mentions \"I will attempt to take the apple at (7, 5)\", taking the apple seems to be the intended strategy to maximize score. The prompt also warns about the enemy potentially taking (8, 6) (there is an apple at (9, 0), not (8, 6), but (7, 5) is there).\n\nLet's verify the board state again.\nRow 5: ` . . . . . . 1 A T . `\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nAt (7, 5) there is an 'A'.\nAt (8, 5) there is a 'T' (Tail of snake #0).\nAt (6, 5) there is '1' (Head).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 5):\nI eat the apple. I grow. The tail of snake #0 at (8, 5) might move if snake #0 moves, but currently it's just an obstacle.\nHowever, moving to (7, 5) puts me adjacent to the enemy tail at (8, 5).\nIf the enemy moves LEFT (to 7, 7), they are safe.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN (to 8, 6), they might hit their own body or go to (8, 6) which is currently `.`.\n\nWait, the prompt's \"Last Rationale\" says: \"If the enemy snake moves to (8, 6) to eat the apple...\" There is no apple at (8, 6). There is an apple at (9, 0).\nMaybe they meant moving towards (9, 0)?\n\nRegardless, the safest path that also gains points is RIGHT.\n\nLet's double check the coordinates.\nHead (6, 5).\nRight is (7, 5). Board row 5: ` . . . . . . 1 A T . `\nColumn 7 is 'A'. Correct.\n\nIs there any reason NOT to take the apple?\n1.  **Self-Collision:** If I move to (7, 5), is it part of my body? No. My body is (6, 6), (6, 7)...\n2.  **Wall:** (7, 5) is inside the board.\n3.  **Enemy:** Snake #0 is at (8, 7). It is 2 units away (Manhattan distance: |8-7| + |7-5| = 1 + 2 = 3). It is not immediately colliding.\n4.  **Trapping:** If I go RIGHT to (7, 5), next turn I can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT (back to 6, 5, which will be part of my body then, so no). So next turn I can go UP (7, 6), Down (7, 4), or Right (8, 5).\n    *   (8, 5) is currently 'T' (Enemy tail). If enemy moves away, it becomes empty. If enemy doesn't move (unlikely), it's a collision.\n    *   (7, 6) is currently `.` (Empty).\n    *   (7, 4) is currently `.` (Empty).\n    So moving RIGHT keeps options open.\n\nAlternative: Move LEFT to (5, 5).\nThis is safe. But I gain no points. Snake #0 has 10 apples, I have 7. I need points to win.\nAlso, the prompt's plan explicitly stated an intent to take the (7, 5) apple if possible.\n\nAlternative: Move DOWN to (6, 4).\nSafe. No points.\n\nConclusion: RIGHT is the best move. It scores a point and is safe.\n\nFinal check on \"Last Move Rationale\" contradictions.\nIt says \"My previous move was UP to (6, 7)\".\nThen it says \"I will move to (6, 6)\".\nThen the \"Last Move Pick\" says \"DOWN\".\nThis implies the user *wanted* to go to (6, 6) (which would be UP from 6, 6? No. To get to 6, 6 from 6, 5 is UP. To get to 6, 6 from 6, 7 is DOWN).\nThe prompt says: \"My previous move was UP to (6, 7)\".\nSo previous state: Head was at (6, 6)? No. UP to (6, 7) means from (6, 6) to (6, 7).\nCurrent state: Head at (6, 5).\nThis implies the user moved DOWN (from 6, 6 to 6, 5) to avoid being trapped at (6, 7) or (6, 8)? No.\nIf the user was at (6, 7), and moved DOWN, they would be at (6, 6).\nIf the user was at (6, 6), and moved UP, they would be at (6, 7).\n\nThe prompt says \"START LAST MOVE PICK: DOWN\".\nThe current state is (6, 5).\nFor a DOWN move to result in (6, 5), the previous head must have been at (6, 6).\nSo the \"Previous move was UP to (6, 7)\" text in the rationale is likely historical flavor text or a specific turn reference that doesn't align perfectly with the immediate coordinate shift in the summary, or I am misreading the \"Head\" line.\n\"Head: (6, 5)\"\n\"START LAST MOVE PICK: DOWN\"\nThis is the only fact that matters for the *current* state transition. The snake is at (6, 5) because it moved DOWN.\n\nMoving to (7, 5) (RIGHT) is safe and beneficial.\n\nOne detail: The enemy snake is at (8, 7). Its body extends down to (8, 6), (8, 5) etc.\nMy proposed move (7, 5) is adjacent to (8, 5) (Enemy tail) and (8, 7) (Enemy head) is somewhat close.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (8, 6), they are safe.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 7), they are safe.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN-LEFT (is that possible? No, only one direction).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (8, 6), and I move RIGHT to (7, 5), no collision.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 7), and I move RIGHT to (7, 5), no collision.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN-LEFT (to 7, 6)? No, can't move diagonally.\n\nThe only danger is if the enemy moves to (7, 5) (which is impossible from (8, 7) in one turn, as that would require moving LEFT+DOWN).\nSo I am safe from head-on collision.\n\nWhat about the apple at (2, 6)? It's further away. I should take the available one now.\n\nI will move RIGHT.\n\nOne final check: The board row 5 is:\n`. . . . . . 1 A T .`\nIndices 0-9.\nAt index 6 (x=6) is '1' (Head).\nAt index 7 (x=7) is 'A' (Target).\nAt index 8 (x=8) is 'T' (Enemy tail).\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 5), I become the new head at x=7.\nThe enemy tail at (8, 5) is to my right.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT (to 7, 7), its tail at (8, 5) moves to (8, 6)?\nWait, if Snake #0 moves LEFT (from 8,7 to 7,7):\nHead: 7,7.\nBody: 8,7 becomes 7,7... no, 8,7 becomes the new neck. The tail (which was at 4, 3?) No, the body list ends at (4, 3). The tail is (4, 3).\nWait, the enemy body list is: `[(8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3)]`.\nSo the tail is (4, 3).\nThe segment at (8, 5) is the second segment.\nIf Snake #0 moves, the segment at (8, 5) moves to (8, 6)?\nWait, if Head (8, 7) moves to (7, 7):\nNew Body: (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), ...\nSo the segment at (8, 5) stays at (8, 5) for one turn (it moves to where (8, 6) was? No, it shifts).\nThe body shifts forward.\nSo (8, 5) will move to (8, 6) in the next turn (assuming head moves).\nMy position (7, 5) is not in the path of (8, 5) or (8, 6).\nSo I am safe.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the correct move.\n\nCoordinate check: Decreasing x is left, increasing x is right. I want to go from x=6 to x=7. That is RIGHT.\n\nI will output RIGHT.\n\nOne last check: The prompt says \"My previous move was UP to (6, 7)\". If the snake was at (6, 7), and moved DOWN, it would be at (6, 6). The current state is (6, 5).\nThis implies the \"Last Move Rationale\" text might be a generic template or refers to a slightly different state than the provided \"Head\" coordinate, but the \"Head\" coordinate is the ground truth.\nCurrent Head (6, 5).\nMove RIGHT to (7, 5).\nSafe.\n\nThe prompt's \"Last Rationale\" mentions \"I will attempt to take the apple at (7, 5)\".\nThis confirms the intent.\n\nFinal Decision: RIGHT.\n\nResponse format:\nJust the word \"RIGHT\".\n\nWait, the instructions say: \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning. ... The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\n\nSo I should write my reasoning, then \"RIGHT\".\n\nReasoning summary:\nCurrent position (6, 5).\nUP (6, 6) is blocked by my body. Unsafe.\nLEFT (5, 5) is safe but scores no points.\nDOWN (6, 4) is safe but scores no points.\nRIGHT (7, 5) is an apple. It is safe (empty, not self, not enemy body).\nScoring a point is necessary to catch up to Snake #0.\nTherefore, RIGHT.\n\nOne edge case: The enemy snake is at (8, 7). Is it possible for them to reach (7, 5) in one turn? No.\nIs it possible for them to block me? No.\n\nI am confident in RIGHT.\n\nWait, let me look at the board again.\nRow 5: `. . . . . . 1 A T .`\nThis means at x=8 (index 8) there is 'T'.\nThe enemy snake #0 is at (8, 7).\nIf enemy moves DOWN (to 8, 6), it is safe.\nIf enemy moves DOWN-LEFT (7, 6) is not possible.\nIf enemy moves LEFT (7, 7), it is safe.\nIf enemy moves UP (8, 8), it is safe.\n\nThere is an apple at (9, 0). Maybe enemy wants that?\nEnemy is at (8, 7). To get to (9, 0) is a long path.\nThe apple at (7, 5) is right next to me.\nI will take it.\n\nWait, the \"Last Move Rationale\" says: \"If the enemy snake moves to (8, 6) to eat the apple...\" There is no apple at (8, 6). There is an apple at (7, 5).\nMaybe the prompt text has a typo about the apple location, but the intent is clear: I want (7, 5).\n\nOkay, moving RIGHT.\n\nOne final check on \"Moving directly backwards into your own body\".\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 5), my neck will be (6, 5).\nNext turn, if I move LEFT back to (6, 5), I die.\nThat is standard snake mechanics. It doesn't affect this turn's safety.\n\nSafety of RIGHT:\n- Target: (7, 5).\n- Is it on board? Yes.\n- Is it in my body `[(6, 6), (6, 7)...]`? No.\n- Is it in enemy body? Enemy is at (8, 7), body starts at (8, 6). No.\n- Is it a head-on collision? Enemy is at (8, 7). To collide, they would need to move to (7, 5), which is impossible (Manhattan distance > 1). No.\n\nResult: Safe.\n\nScore: Gain 1 point.\nStrategy: Aggressive scoring to catch up.\n\nThe plan is to go RIGHT.\n\nOutput:\nRIGHT\n\nWait, the prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.\"\n\nOkay.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thought_process\": \"I am at (6, 5). UP is blocked by my body at (6, 6). LEFT and DOWN are safe empty spaces but do not score. RIGHT is an apple at (7, 5) and is safe (empty, not wall, not body, not enemy). To catch up to Snake #0 (who has 10 apples vs my 7), I must take scoring opportunities. RIGHT is the best move.\",\n  \"move\": \"RIGHT\"\n}\n```\n\nWait, the user prompt asks for a standard text response, not JSON.\n\"Just write the reasoning... The final non-empty line...\".\n\nOkay.\n\nReasoning: My head is at (6, 5). The cell to my right (7, 5) contains an apple. I can move there safely to score a point. Moving up would crash into my own body at (6, 6). Moving left or down are safe but don't advance my score. Since I am trailing Snake #0 by 3 apples, taking the apple is the priority.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT.\n\nOne detail: The prompt says \"START LAST MOVE PICK: DOWN\".\nThis confirms I am at (6, 5) because I moved down from (6, 6).\nThe body is `[(6, 6), ...]`.\nSo (6, 6) is indeed my body. Moving UP into it would be death.\nMy logic holds.\n\nI will write the response nowI am currently at (6, 5). Moving UP would crash into my own body at (6, 6). Moving LEFT or DOWN are safe but do not score any points. Moving RIGHT allows me to eat the apple at (7, 5), which is essential to catch up to Snake #0 who has 10 apples. The move is safe as the target cell is empty and not occupied by any snake.\n\nRIGHT",

The board shows this is an apple, which I have presumably just eaten (or moved onto), but looking at the new board state for turn 34, the apple at (7, 5) is gone, replaced by my head '1'.\nWait, looking at the provided board state for Turn 34:\nRow 5: ` . . . . . . T 1 T . `\nThis indicates my head is at (7, 5) and the apple is gone. The 'T' at (8, 5) is the tail of Snake #0.\n\nLet me re-evaluate the board state provided in the prompt for Turn 34.\nHead: (7, 5)\nBody: [(6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)]\nThis corresponds to the board.\nRow 5: ` . . . . . . T 1 T . ` -> (0,5) to (9,5). (7,5) is '1'.\nRow 6: ` . . A . . . T . T . ` -> (6,6) is 'T' (my body). (8,6) is 'T' (Enemy body? No, enemy is at (9,7) mostly? Let's check enemy).\nEnemy #0: Head (9, 7). Body [(8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5) ...]\nRow 7: ` . . . . . . T T T 0 ` -> (6,7) is 'T' (Me), (8,7) is 'T' (Enemy body), (9,7) is '0' (Enemy Head).\nRow 8: ` . A . . . . . T . . ` -> (7,8) is 'T' (Me).\nRow 9: ` . . . . . . T T T . ` -> (6,9) is 'T' (Me), (8,9) is 'T' (Enemy body? No, Enemy body is at (8,7) and (8,6)...). Wait, the Enemy body list is `[(8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2)]`.\nSo the Enemy body is mostly on the right side (x=8) and bottom-right.\nThe board row 9 shows `T` at (6,9), (7,9), (8,9). (7,9) is My body (from my list). (6,9) is My body. (8,9) is NOT in Enemy body list. Is it a glitch?\nWait, the Enemy list is only 10 segments. (9,7) head, (8,7), (8,6)... (4,2).\nThe board row 9: ` . . . . . . T T T . `\nIndices 0-9.\n(6,9) -> T (Me)\n(7,9) -> T (Me)\n(8,9) -> T (???)\nLet's check my body again: `[(6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)]`.\nSo (7,9) and (6,9) are definitely mine.\nThe 'T' at (8,9) on the board must be a visualization artifact or a mistake in the prompt description, or the Enemy body is longer than listed?\nWait, the Enemy body list ends at (4,2). So (8,9) is empty? Or maybe the board just shows 'T' for any body part, and I shouldn't worry about the specific phantom 'T' at (8,9) that isn't in the list.\nHowever, let's look at the *apples*.\nApples at: (9, 0), (3, 2), (2, 6), (1, 8), (1, 0).\nMy position: (7, 5).\nEnemy Head: (9, 7).\n\nLet's check my possible moves from (7, 5):\n1.  **UP to (7, 6):**\n    *   Board Row 6: ` . . A . . . T . T . `\n    *   (7, 6) is '.' (empty).\n    *   Body check: My body starts at (6, 5), then (6, 6)...\n    *   So (7, 6) is NOT in my body list.\n    *   Safe.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 4):**\n    *   Board Row 4: ` . . . . . . . . T . `\n    *   (7, 4) is '.' (empty).\n    *   Body check: (7, 4) not in list.\n    *   Safe.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 5):**\n    *   Board Row 5: ` . . . . . . T 1 T . `\n    *   (6, 5) is 'T'.\n    *   This is my second body segment. Moving here is self-collision. **UNSAFE.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 5):**\n    *   Board Row 5: ` . . . . . . T 1 T . `\n    *   (8, 5) is 'T'.\n    *   This is part of Enemy Body: `[(8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), ...]`. Yes, (8, 5) is Enemy body.\n    *   Moving into Enemy body is death. **UNSAFE.**\n    *   *Exception*: If Enemy Head dies and the body disappears? No, only the segment where the enemy head hits dies. But here I am moving into an enemy body segment. That kills me.\n    *   Wait, if Enemy Head at (9,7) moves, the body shifts. But *this turn*, (8, 5) is occupied by the enemy.\n    *   So RIGHT is death.\n\nSo my only safe moves are UP and DOWN.\n\nWhere are the apples?\n(9, 0) - Bottom right corner.\n(3, 2) - Left side.\n(2, 6) - Left side.\n(1, 8) - Left side.\n(1, 0) - Bottom left.\n\nMy current position (7, 5) is center-right.\nThe Enemy is at (9, 7) (top right).\nIf I go UP to (7, 6):\nI move closer to the Enemy (which is at 9,7).\nIf Enemy moves DOWN to (9, 6), we are adjacent.\nIf Enemy moves LEFT to (8, 7), we are adjacent (dist 1).\nIf Enemy moves LEFT to (8, 7), and I am at (7, 6), distance is 1.\nIf Enemy moves DOWN to (9, 6), distance is 2.\nIf Enemy moves DOWN-LEFT (not possible).\nSo moving UP brings me closer to the enemy's territory.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4):\nI move towards the bottom of the board, towards the apple at (9, 0).\nDistance to (9, 0) from (7, 5) is 2 right, 5 down.\nDistance to (9, 0) from (7, 4) is 2 right, 4 down.\nDistance to apples at (3, 2) etc. is huge.\n\nStrategy:\nI am at (7, 5). I cannot go LEFT (into self) or RIGHT (into enemy).\nI must go UP or DOWN.\nIf I go UP to (7, 6):\n- I am getting closer to Enemy Head (9, 7).\n- Enemy might move DOWN to (9, 6). If so, I am safe at (7, 6).\n- Enemy might move LEFT to (8, 7). If so, I am safe at (7, 6).\n- What if Enemy moves DOWN-LEFT? Not allowed.\n- However, there is an apple at (9, 0). Enemy might go DOWN.\n- There is an apple at (1, 8). Enemy might go UP-LEFT? No, Enemy is at (9, 7). (1, 8) is far.\n- Wait, Enemy has 10 apples. I have 8. I need points.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 6: ` . . A . . . T . T . `\nIf I go UP to (7, 6), I am at (7, 6).\nMy body will be: (6, 5), (7, 5)...\nWait, if I go UP to (7, 6), next turn I can go LEFT (6, 6) (which is currently 'T' on board, but will shift away?).\nNo, (6, 6) is currently a 'T'. If I move UP to (7, 6), my body becomes `[(6, 5), (7, 5), ...]`.\n(6, 6) will still be occupied by my body (the segment that was at (6, 7) moves to (6, 6)? No.\nCurrent Body: `(6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)`.\nIf I move UP to (7, 6):\nNew Body: `(6, 5), (7, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), ...`\nSo at (6, 6) there will be a body segment.\nSo next turn, moving LEFT from (7, 6) to (6, 6) is death.\nMoving DOWN from (7, 6) to (7, 5) is death (neck).\nMoving RIGHT from (7, 6) to (8, 6).\nBoard (8, 6) is 'T'. Is it Enemy body? Enemy body is `[(8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5) ...]`. Yes, (8, 6) is Enemy body.\nSo from (7, 6), next turn:\n- LEFT: Self collision (die).\n- DOWN: Neck collision (die).\n- RIGHT: Enemy body (die).\n- UP: (7, 7).\nBoard (7, 7) is 'T'. It is my body (index 4).\nSo UP is also death.\nWait, if I go to (7, 6), I am effectively trapped for the next turn?\nLet's re-verify.\nCurrent Head: (7, 5).\nBody: `(6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), ...`\nIf I move UP to (7, 6):\n- Head (7, 6)\n- Neck (7, 5)\n- Next: (6, 5)\n- Next: (6, 6)\n- Next: (6, 7)\n- Next: (7, 7)\n- ...\n\nSo (7, 6) is Head.\nNext turn, I can move:\n- UP to (7, 7). (7, 7) is currently 'T' in my body. It will shift? No, the tail moves.\nIf I eat an apple, tail stays. If I don't, tail moves.\nCurrent state: No apple at (7, 6).\nSo if I move UP to (7, 6), I do NOT grow.\nThe tail at (5, 9) moves to (6, 9)? No, (5, 9) moves, but the chain is long.\nLet's look at the chain movement.\nHead (7, 5) -> (7, 6).\nNeck (6, 5) -> (7, 5).\nBody (6, 6) -> (6, 5).\nBody (6, 7) -> (6, 6).\nBody (7, 7) -> (6, 7).\nBody (7, 8) -> (7, 7).\nBody (7, 9) -> (7, 8).\nBody (6, 9) -> (7, 9).\nBody (5, 9) -> (6, 9).\nTail (empty) -> (5, 9) (since I didn't eat).\n\nSo new positions:\n(7, 6) - Head\n(7, 5) - Neck\n(6, 5) - Body\n(6, 6) - Body\n(6, 7) - Body\n(7, 7) - Body\n(7, 8) - Body\n(7, 9) - Body\n(6, 9) - Body\n(5, 9) - Body\n\nNow, where is the enemy?\nHead: (9, 7).\nBody: (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5)...\n\nIf I am at (7, 6), can I move next turn?\n- UP: (7, 7). My body will be at (7, 7) (from previous step). So UP is death.\n- DOWN: (7, 5). Neck is at (7, 5). So DOWN is death.\n- LEFT: (6, 6). My body will be at (6, 6). So LEFT is death.\n- RIGHT: (8, 6). Enemy body will be at (8, 6) (assuming Enemy moves, but Enemy body usually stays or shifts).\nIf Enemy moves, (8, 6) might be empty?\nIf Enemy Head (9, 7) moves DOWN to (9, 6), Enemy body becomes: (8, 7), (8, 6)...\nWait, Enemy moves.\nIf Enemy moves DOWN: Head (9, 6). Body (9, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6)...\nSo (8, 6) is occupied by Enemy Body.\nIf Enemy moves LEFT: Head (8, 7). Body (9, 7), (8, 7)...\nWait, if Head moves to (8, 7), it occupies (8, 7). The body fills in behind.\nSo (8, 6) remains occupied by the previous body part (which was at (8, 7) -> (8, 6)? No.\nCurrent Enemy Body: (8, 7), (8, 6)...\nIf Head moves LEFT to (8, 7):\nNew Head: (8, 7).\nOld Head becomes neck: (9, 7).\nBody shifts: (8, 7) -> (8, 7) (collision with self? No, head moves first, then body fills).\nWait, the head moves to (8, 7). The body part currently at (8, 7) moves to (8, 6).\nSo (8, 6) becomes occupied.\nIf I am at (7, 6), moving RIGHT to (8, 6) hits Enemy Body.\n\nSo, if I move UP to (7, 6), I am effectively trapped. I die next turn unless I eat an apple that grows me, creating space, or the enemy dies/moves away significantly.\n\nLet's look at DOWN to (7, 4).\nCurrent Head: (7, 5).\nMove DOWN: (7, 4).\nBody becomes: (6, 5), (7, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), ...\nWait, (6, 5) is my current neck.\nNew Body: (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), ...\nSo positions:\n(7, 4) - Head\n(7, 5) - Neck\n(6, 5) - Body\n(6, 6) - Body\n(6, 7) - Body\n...\n\nCheck next turn options from (7, 4):\n- DOWN: (7, 3). Is it empty? Row 3: ` . . . . . . T T T . `. (7, 3) is 'T' (Enemy body?). Enemy body is (7, 3) in the list: `[(8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3)...]`. Yes, (7, 3) is Enemy body. So DOWN is likely blocked.\n- UP: (7, 5). Neck. Death.\n- LEFT: (6, 4). Row 4: ` . . . . . . . . T . `. (6, 4) is '.'. Is it my body? Body is at (6, 5), (6, 6)... No. So LEFT is safe.\n- RIGHT: (8, 4). Row 4: ` . . . . . . . . T . `. (8, 4) is 'T'. Enemy body: (8, 4) is in the list. So RIGHT is blocked.\n\nSo if I go DOWN to (7, 4), next turn I can only go LEFT to (6, 4).\nAfter that, from (6, 4), I can go DOWN (6, 3) -> Enemy body? (6, 3) is Enemy body. LEFT (5, 4) -> Empty? Row 4 has '.' everywhere except (8,4). So (5, 4) is empty. UP (6, 5) -> Neck (7, 5) then (6, 5) is body? Yes, (6, 5) will be body. So UP is blocked. RIGHT (7, 4) -> Neck. Blocked.\nSo from (6, 4) I can only go LEFT.\nThis path (DOWN -> LEFT) leads me towards the apples at (3, 2), (2, 6) on the left side.\n\nThe Enemy is at (9, 7). They are looking at apples at (9, 0) or (1, 8).\nIf I go DOWN, I move away from the Enemy.\nIf I go UP, I move towards the Enemy.\n\nIs there an apple at (7, 6)? No.\nIs there an apple at (7, 4)? No.\nSo neither move scores immediately.\nHowever, the board shows an apple at (3, 2).\nMy current pos (7, 5).\nPath: (7, 5) -> (6, 5) is blocked by my body.\nSo I must detour.\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4), I can go LEFT to (6, 4), LEFT to (5, 4)...\nIf I go UP to (7, 6), I am trapped.\n\nWait, let's re-verify \"UP to (7, 6)\".\nIs there ANY escape?\n(7, 6) is surrounded by my body at (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (7, 5).\nWait, (7, 7) is my body.\nIf I eat an apple at (7, 6), I grow. The tail stays.\nSo next turn:\nHead (7, 6).\nNeck (7, 5).\nBody (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), ...\nIf I ate, tail stays at (5, 9). So the body extends.\nCan I go UP? (7, 7) is occupied by body. No.\nDOWN? (7, 5) is neck. No.\nLEFT? (6, 6) is body. No.\nRIGHT? (8, 6). Enemy body? Enemy is at (9, 7).\nIf Enemy moves DOWN to (9, 6), body shifts to (9, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6). (8, 6) occupied.\nIf Enemy moves LEFT to (8, 7), body shifts to (9, 7), (8, 7). (8, 6) becomes empty?\nWait, if Enemy Head (9, 7) moves to (8, 7).\nCurrent Enemy Body: (8, 7), (8, 6), ...\nIf Head moves to (8, 7), the body segment at (8, 7) moves to (8, 6).\nSo (8, 6) is occupied.\nIf Enemy moves UP to (9, 8)?\nBoard (9, 8) is 'T'? No, board row 8: ` . A . . . . . T . . `. (9, 8) is '.'.\nEnemy moves UP to (9, 8): Body becomes (9, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6)...\n(8, 6) is still occupied by the segment that was at (8, 7).\nSo (8, 6) is almost always occupied by Enemy Body, unless the Enemy moves far away (which it can't in one turn).\n\nSo UP to (7, 6) is a trap. I die next turn.\nTherefore, UP is not an option.\n\nSo I must go DOWN to (7, 4).\n\nAfter going DOWN to (7, 4):\nI am at (7, 4).\nNext turn I can only go LEFT to (6, 4) (since DOWN (7, 3) is Enemy, UP (7, 5) Neck, RIGHT (8, 4) Enemy).\nSo the path is forced: DOWN -> LEFT -> LEFT... towards (3, 2).\n\nIs there any other option?\nWhat about turning LEFT immediately? I can't. (6, 5) is blocked.\nWhat about turning RIGHT? I can't. (8, 5) is Enemy.\n\nSo I have to go DOWN.\n\nWait, is there an apple at (7, 4)? No.\nIs there an apple at (6, 4)? No.\nIs there an apple at (5, 4)? No.\nThe nearest apple is (3, 2) or (2, 6).\n\nLet's trace the path to (3, 2):\n(7, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 2).\nThis is a clear path on Row 4 and 5? Row 4 has '.' except (8,4). Row 3 has '.' except (6,3) to (8,3) and (9,3)? No, Row 3: ` . . . . . . T T T . `.\nSo (6,3), (7,3), (8,3) are occupied by Enemy.\nSo I must avoid Row 3 at x=6,7,8.\nSo from (3, 4) I can go DOWN to (3, 3), then DOWN to (3, 2) (Apple).\n\nThis seems viable.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Go DOWN to (7, 4).\nThen plan to go LEFT, then LEFT... towards the left side.\n\nOne check: The enemy snake is at (9, 7). Apples are at (9, 0) and (1, 8).\nThe enemy might go DOWN to (9, 6).\nIf enemy goes DOWN, its body will cover (8, 7), (8, 6)...\nMy path is on the left. I am safe.\n\nDecision: Go DOWN.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"START LAST MOVE PICK: DOWN\".\nThis implies I moved DOWN last turn to get to (7, 5).\nWait, if I moved DOWN to (7, 5), I came from (7, 6).\nLet's look at the body: `[(6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9)]`.\nIf I was at (7, 6) and moved DOWN to (7, 5), my body would become:\nOld body: `(6, 5), (6, 6), ...`\nWait, if I was at (7, 6), my body would start with (6, 6)? No.\nIf I was at (7, 6), and the body list was `[(6, 6), ...]`, then moving DOWN to (7, 5) gives:\nNew Head: (7, 5).\nNew Body: (6, 6), (6, 7), ...\nBut the current body starts with (6, 5).\nSo to get (6, 5) as the first body segment, the previous head must have been at (6, 5).\nIf I moved DOWN to (7, 5), I came from (7, 6)?\nWait, if previous head was (7, 6), and I moved DOWN to (7, 5), the old head (7, 6) becomes the new neck (first element of body).\nSo body should start with (7, 6).\nBut the body starts with (6, 5).\nThis implies I moved LEFT to (7, 5) from (8, 5)? No, (8, 5) is enemy.\nOr I moved DOWN to (7, 5) from (7, 6) ONLY IF my body list was different.\nLet's check the turn flow.\nTurn 33: Head at (6, 7)? No, the \"Last Move Rationale\" says \"My previous move was UP to (6, 7)\".\nSo previous head was (6, 7).\nWait, \"START LAST MOVE PICK: DOWN\".\nSo the user picked DOWN.\nIf head was (6, 7), and moved DOWN, head becomes (6, 6).\nBut the current head is (7, 5).\nThere is a discrepancy in the provided history vs current state.\nCurrent State: Head (7, 5). Body starts (6, 5).\nThis means previous head was (6, 5).\nIf I moved RIGHT from (6, 5) to (7, 5), previous head was (6, 5).\nIf I moved DOWN from (6, 6) to (6, 5), previous head was (6, 6).\nLet's assume the current state is ground truth.\nCurrent Head: (7, 5).\nBody: `(6, 5), (6, 6), ...`\nSo the segment at (6, 5) is my neck.\nThis means I moved RIGHT to get to (7, 5).\nOr I moved DOWN/UP?\nIf I moved RIGHT from (6, 5) to (7, 5):\nNeck is (6, 5). Correct.\nIf I moved DOWN from (7, 6) to (7, 5):\nNeck is (7, 6).\nBut the body list starts with (6, 5). So (7, 6) is not in the list (it's further down).\nSo I did NOT move DOWN from (7, 6).\nSo the \"START LAST MOVE PICK: DOWN\" in the prompt seems to be inconsistent with the board state provided.\nHowever, I must trust the board state provided for Turn 34.\nHead (7, 5).\nBody surrounding:\n- (6, 5) is T (Neck)\n- (7, 6) is T (Body? No, (7, 6) is T on board but not in body list if I look at row 6... wait row 6 shows ` . . A . . . T . T . `.\n(7, 6) is '.'.\n(6, 6) is 'T'.\n(6, 5) is 'T' (implied, not on board row 5, but part of body).\nSo the body is on the left and up.\nSo I can't go LEFT (6, 5) is blocked.\nI can't go UP? (7, 6) is empty.\nI can't go DOWN? (7, 4) is empty.\nI can't go RIGHT (8, 5) is Enemy Body.\n\nSo my analysis of (7, 5) -> UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT is correct regardless of how I got there.\nUP (7, 6) -> Empty. Safe.\nDOWN (7, 4) -> Empty. Safe.\nLEFT (6, 5) -> Body. Unsafe.\nRIGHT (8, 5) -> Enemy Body. Unsafe.\n\nNow, the decision between UP and DOWN.\nThe \"Last Rationale\" provided with the prompt mentions \"If the enemy snake moves to (8, 6) to eat the apple...\".\nWait, where is the apple?\nApples: (9, 0), (3, 2), (2, 6), (1, 8), (1, 0).\nThere is NO apple at (8, 6).\nThe prompt's \"Last Rationale\" might be confusing (perhaps referring to a hypothetical or previous turn scenario).\nHowever, the core question remains: UP or DOWN?\n\nMy previous logic showed UP leads to a trap (surrounded by my own body on 3 sides and enemy on the 4th).\nLet's re-verify the \"surrounded\" hypothesis.\nIf I go UP to (7, 6):\nSurrounding cells:\n- (6, 6): Currently 'T' (My body). Will remain my body.\n- (7, 7): Currently '.' (Row 7 has (7,7) empty, (6,7) T). Wait, Row 7: ` . . . . . . T T T 0 `.\nIndices 0-9.\n(6, 7) is T.\n(7, 7) is T.\n(8, 7) is T.\nSo (7, 7) is my body.\n- (8, 6): Currently 'T' (Enemy body).\n- (7, 5): Neck.\nSo yes, (7, 6) is surrounded by Death on all 4 sides (Self, Self, Enemy, Self).\nIt is a trap.\nTherefore, UP is death (next turn).\n\nSo I must go DOWN.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4):\nSurrounding:\n- (6, 4): Empty.\n- (7, 5): Neck (Death).\n- (8, 4): Enemy Body (Death).\n- (7, 3): Enemy Body (Death).\nSo from (7, 4), I can only go LEFT to (6, 4).\nThis is a \"corridor\". I will be forced to move LEFT along row 4 (since row 3 has enemy at 6,7,8).\nMoving LEFT allows me to reach the apples on the left side (3,2) or (2,6).\n\nIs there any scenario where I shouldn't go DOWN?\nWhat if Enemy dies?\nEven if Enemy dies, I am trapped if I go UP (self collision). I can't survive going UP.\nSo I MUST go DOWN.\n\nThe prompt mentions \"START LAST MOVE PICK: DOWN\".\nThis implies that in the previous turn (Turn 33), the user moved DOWN to get to (7, 5).\nIf the user moved DOWN to (7, 5), then the previous head was (7, 6).\nIf previous head was (7, 6), the body would have been `(6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7)...`.\nMoving DOWN to (7, 5) would result in body `[(6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7)...]`.\nBut the current body is `[(6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7)...]`.\nThis confirms the \"Last Move Pick\" text in the prompt is likely a generic template or inconsistent with the specific board state, or I am misinterpreting the coordinate system (Y is up, X is right).\n\nHowever, looking at the board state:\nRow 5: `. . . . . . T 1 T .`\nMy head is at index 7.\nRow 6: `. . A . . . T . T .`\nIndex 6 is 'T' (My body).\nIndex 7 is '.' (Empty).\nRow 4: `. . . . . . . . T .`\nIndex 7 is '.' (Empty).\nIndex 8 is 'T' (Enemy body).\n\nSo UP is (7, 6) -> Empty, but surrounded by body/enemy.\nDOWN is (7, 4) -> Empty, but blocked on 3 sides, open to (6, 4).\n\nI will go DOWN.\n\nOne check: Is there an apple I am missing?\nNo.\nIs there a way to get an apple?\nThe closest apple is (3, 2). My current pos (7, 5).\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 4), I can go LEFT to (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2).\nThis path exists.\nIf I go UP to (7, 6), I die.\n\nTherefore, the only valid move is DOWN.\n\nFinal check: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body\".\nIs (7, 4) \"backwards\"? No, backwards would be (6, 5) (Left).\nDOWN is a valid turn.\n\nDecision: DOWN.\n\nOne nuance: The enemy is at (9, 7). Apples at (9, 0) and (1, 8).\nEnemy likely wants (9, 0).\nI am at (7, 5).\nIf I go DOWN, I move away from Enemy and towards (9, 0) (but mostly towards left).\nActually, (9, 0) is bottom right. (7, 5) -> (7, 4) moves closer to Y=0, but I am blocked by enemy bodies on the right side.\nI am forced to go left.\n\nOkay.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"move\": \"DOWN\"\n}\n```\n\nWait, the prompt asks for reasoning first.\nThe prompt says \"You may think out loud... The final non-empty line... must be exactly one word...\".\n\nReasoning:\nMy head is at (7, 5).\nMoving LEFT (6, 5) hits my own body.\nMoving RIGHT (8, 5) hits the enemy snake's body.\nMoving UP (7, 6) appears safe immediately (empty square), but looking at the board geometry, (7, 6) is completely surrounded by my own body at (6, 6) and (7, 7), the enemy body at (8, 6), and my neck at (7, 5). This is a trap that would result in death on the subsequent turn.\nMoving DOWN (7, 4) is an empty square and is the only move that keeps the snake alive and allows for future movement (specifically, LEFT to (6, 4), initiating a path towards the apples on the left side of the board).\nTherefore, I must move DOWN.\n\nFinal move: DOWN.\n\nI will output \"DOWN\".\n\nOne last check on the board state for row 6.\nRow 6: ` . . A . . . T . T . `\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(6, 6) is T (My body).\n(8, 6) is T (Enemy body).\n(7, 6) is '.'.\nSo UP is indeed empty, but occupied by body immediately next turn.\nCorrect.\n\nRow 4: ` . . . . . . . . T . `\n(8, 4) is T (Enemy).\n(7, 4) is '.'.\nSo DOWN is empty.\nCorrect.\n\nI am confident.\n\nDOWN\n```json\n{\n  \"move\": \"DOWN\"\n}\n```\n\nWait, just the word.\n\nDOWN\n\nWait, I should check if I can go LEFT to (6, 5).\nBoard Row 5: ` . . . . . . T 1 T . `\n(6, 5) is 'T'. My body.\nCorrect.\n\nCan I go UP to (7, 6)?\nBoard Row 6: ` . . A . . . T . T . `\n(7, 6) is '.'.\nSurrounding (7, 6):\n- (6, 6): T (My body)\n- (7, 7): T (My body) -> Confirmed by Row 7: ` . . . . . . T T T 0 ` (7,7 is T)\n- (8, 6): T (Enemy body)\n- (7, 5): 1 (Neck)\nYes, trapped.\n\nCan I go DOWN to (7, 4)?\nBoard Row 4: ` . . . . . . . . T . `\n(7, 4) is '.'.\nSurrounding (7, 4):\n- (6, 4): '.' (Empty)\n- (7, 5): 1 (Neck)\n- (8, 4): T (Enemy body)\n- (7, 3): T (Enemy body) -> Confirmed by Row 3: ` . . . . . . T T T . ` (7,3 is T)\nSo only (6, 4) is open.\nThis is a \"corridor\". It is safe for one turn, and leads to the left side.\nThis is the correct play.\n\nDOWN.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"move\": \"DOWN\"\n}\n```\n\nWait, the prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\nSo I should just write DOWN.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"move\": \"DOWN\"\n}\n```\n\nNo, that's invalid based on the prompt instructions. It says \"You may think out loud... The final non-empty line...\". It doesn't say I *must* use JSON. It says \"The final non-empty line... must be exactly one word\".\nSo I can write text and then \"DOWN\".\n\nI will write the reasoning and then \"DOWN\".\n\nReasoning:\n1.  Current position: (7, 5).\n2.  Available moves:\n    *   LEFT (6, 5): Occupied by my body. Unsafe.\n    *   RIGHT (8, 5): Occupied by Enemy body. Unsafe.\n    *   UP (7, 6): Empty cell, but completely surrounded by my own body (at 6,6 and 7,7), enemy body (at 8,6), and my neck (7,5). If I move here, I will have zero safe moves on the next turn (death). Unsafe for future survival.\n    *   DOWN (7, 4): Empty cell. Surrounded by my neck (7,5), enemy body (8,4 and 7,3), but open to (6, 4).\n3.  Conclusion: Only DOWN allows the snake to survive and maneuver towards the apples on the left side of the board (e.g., at 3,2).\n\nDOWN",
