Need to check enemy movements too\n- DOWN: (2, 3) - empty, safe\n- LEFT: (1, 4) - contains an apple, but is this safe?\n- RIGHT: (3, 4) - empty, safe\n\n**Enemy threat analysis:**\nSnake #0 is at (0, 2), which is quite far from my position. They could move UP (0, 3), DOWN (0, 1), RIGHT (1, 2), but not LEFT (off board).\n\n**Apple priority:**\nThe closest apples are at (2, 5) directly above me and (1, 4) directly to my left. Both are immediately reachable.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- UP to (2, 5): Gets me an apple but puts me near the top edge (y=5, board goes to y=9)\n- LEFT to (1, 4): Gets me an apple and keeps me more central\n- RIGHT to (3, 4): Safe but no immediate reward\n- DOWN to (2, 3): Safe but moves away from most apples\n\n**Risk assessment:**\nThe enemy is too far to threaten me this turn. UP seems safe since enemy can't reach (2,5) in one move. LEFT is also safe for the same reason.\n\n**Decision:**\nI'll go for the apple at (1, 4) to the LEFT. This gives me immediate growth while keeping options open - I'll be more centrally located with good access to other apples.\n\nLEFT",

          "move": "RIGHT",
          "rationale": "Looking at the board, I'm at (0,2) with no body yet. Snake #1 is at (2,4). There are apples at (4,1), (2,5), (5,4), (1,4), (8,1).\n\nFirst, let's evaluate each move for immediate safety:\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (0,3): Within board (0-9, 0-9). No snakes there. Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (0,1): Within board. No snakes there. Safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (-1,2): Off board (x < 0). Dies immediately. Not safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (1,2): Within board. No snakes there. Safe.\n\nSo LEFT is eliminated. UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow, consider enemy movement: Snake #1 at (2,4) could move anywhere. It might aim for nearby apples like (1,4) or (2,5). I need to avoid potential head-on collisions.\n\nMy possible moves:\n- **UP** to (0,3): Puts me farther from most apples except maybe (1,4) is two steps away (right then down). But moving up opens space.\n- **DOWN** to (0,1): Puts me closer to apple at (4,1) horizontally (4 steps right) and (8,1) far right. Also closer to (1,4) vertically? Actually (1,4) is up and right.\n- **RIGHT** to (1,2): Moves toward center, closer to apple at (1,4) (up 2, right 0) and (2,5) (up 3, right 1). Also away from left wall.\n\nI should think about future mobility: Being at (0,2) near left edge limits left moves. Moving RIGHT opens more options. Moving DOWN keeps me near bottom edge. UP moves away from bottom but still near left edge.\n\nApple proximity: The closest apples are (1,4) and (2,5). From (0,2):\n- To (1,4): Manhattan distance = |1-0| + |4-2| = 1+2=3.\n- To (2,5): |2-0| + |5-2| = 2+3=5.\nFrom (1,2) after RIGHT: to (1,4) distance 2, to (2,5) distance 4. Improves.\nFrom (0,3) after UP: to (1,4) distance 2, to (2,5) distance 4. Same improvement.\nFrom (0,1) after DOWN: to (1,4) distance 4, to (2,5) distance 6. Worse.\n\nSo UP and RIGHT both improve proximity to nearest apples. DOWN does not.\n\nNow consider enemy: Snake #1 at (2,4) might move DOWN to (2,3) or LEFT to (1,4) toward apple, or RIGHT to (3,4), or UP to (2,5). If it moves LEFT to (1,4), and I move RIGHT to (1,2), we're not colliding. If it moves DOWN, no issue. Head-on collision risk? The only overlap could be if I move RIGHT to (1,2) and it moves LEFT to (1,4)? Not same cell. If I move UP to (0,3) and it moves LEFT to (1,4)? No. So no direct head-on risk this turn.\n\nFuture options: After RIGHT to (1,2), my next moves could be UP, DOWN, RIGHT (LEFT goes back to (0,2) which is safe but less progress). That gives 3 options. After UP to (0,3), next moves could be UP, RIGHT, LEFT (DOWN back to start). Also 3 options. After DOWN to (0,1), next moves could be DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT (UP back). Also 3 options. So all safe moves give similar future mobility.\n\nBut moving RIGHT gets me away from left edge, giving more space. Also, apple at (1,4) is above me; moving RIGHT then UP might be efficient.\n\n**Long-term plan**: Aim to collect apples while avoiding enemy. Since I'm short, I can be agile. Snake #1 is also short. I should try to get to (1,4) or (2,5) before it does. Moving RIGHT this turn positions me better for that.\n\n**Final move**: RIGHT",

Multiple apples available - prioritize accessing (5,4) and (4,1) while maintaining central positioning. Snake #0 is at (1,2) - maintain distance and watch for potential head-on collisions. Focus on expanding toward the cluster of apples in the central-right area while keeping escape routes open.\n\n**CURRENT TURN ANALYSIS:**\n\n**Position check:**\n- My head: (1,4), body: [(2,4)]\n- Snake #0 head: (1,2)\n- Apples: (4,1), (2,5), (5,4), (8,1), (0,8)\n\n**Direction safety assessment:**\n- UP: (1,5) - empty, safe\n- DOWN: (1,3) - empty, but close to enemy at (1,2)\n- LEFT: (0,4) - empty, safe\n- RIGHT: (2,4) - my own body segment, would die\n\nRIGHT is immediately eliminated (into my own body).\n\n**Enemy threat analysis:**\nSnake #0 at (1,2) can move UP (1,3), RIGHT (2,2), DOWN (1,1), or LEFT (0,2).

LEFT to (0,4) moves me toward the edge and limits options. DOWN to (1,3) risks immediate proximity to the enemy.\n\n**Final decision:**\nUP is the safest move that maintains strategic positioning and future apple access options.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n\nAll four moves are immediately safe this turn.\n\nNow consider enemy movement: Snake #1's head is at (1,4) with body at (2,4). Its possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (1,5): Empty.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,3): Empty.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,4): Empty.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,4): Into its own body (tail) - would die.\n\nSo Snake #1 will likely avoid RIGHT. It might move UP toward apple (2,5), DOWN toward me/center, or LEFT toward apple (0,8)? Actually (0,8) is far. Apple at (1,4) is already occupied by its head? Wait, apple at (1,4) is not listed; apples are at (4,1), (2,5), (5,4), (8,1), (0,8). The board shows 'A' at (1,4)? Let me check: Board shows at row 4, column 1: \"1 T\" meaning Snake #1 head at (1,4) and tail at (2,4). No apple at (1,4). So Snake #1 might move toward (2,5) (UP) or (4,1) (DOWN+LEFT) or (5,4) (RIGHT+DOWN? Actually (5,4) is right and same y).\n\nPotential head-on collisions: If I move UP to (1,3) and Snake #1 moves DOWN to (1,3), we'd collide. That's a risk. Similarly, if I move RIGHT to (2,2) and Snake #1 moves DOWN to (1,3)? No collision. If I move LEFT to (0,2) and Snake #1 moves DOWN to (1,3)? No. If I move DOWN to (1,1) and Snake #1 moves DOWN to (1,3)? No.\n\nSo UP has a risk if Snake #1 moves DOWN. Other moves seem safer regarding head-on.\n\nApple proximity: From my head (1,2):\n- To (4,1): distance |4-1|+|1-2|=3+1=4\n- To (2,5): |2-1|+|5-2|=1+3=4\n- To (5,4): |5-1|+|4-2|=4+2=6\n- To (8,1): |8-1|+|1-2|=7+1=8\n- To (0,8): |0-1|+|8-2|=1+6=7\n\nClosest are (4,1) and (2,5) at distance 4.\n\nEvaluating moves:\n- **UP** to (1,3): Gets closer to (2,5) distance now 3, but farther from (4,1) distance 5. Risk of head-on if enemy moves DOWN.\n- **DOWN** to (1,1): Gets closer to (4,1) distance 3, farther from (2,5) distance 5.\n- **LEFT** to (0,2): Slightly closer to (0,8)? distance 6, but farther from most apples.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,2): Gets closer to (2,5) distance 3, and (5,4) distance 5, and (4,1) distance 4.\n\nRIGHT seems good for multiple apples. DOWN targets (4,1) specifically. UP targets (2,5) but with collision risk.\n\nFuture mobility: From (1,2):\n- After UP (1,3): Next moves UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all potentially safe unless enemy moves.\n- After DOWN (1,1): Similar.\n- After LEFT (0,2): Left edge limits LEFT moves next turn.\n- After RIGHT (2,2): Central, all directions open.\n\nConsidering Snake #1's likely moves: It will probably avoid RIGHT into its own tail. It might go UP toward (2,5) or DOWN toward center/me. If it goes UP to (1,5), then my UP to (1,3) is safe. If it goes DOWN to (1,3), then my UP would cause head-on collision. Since I can't predict perfectly, maybe avoid UP.\n\nDOWN seems safe: Snake #1 is unlikely to move DOWN twice? Actually from (1,4) DOWN is (1,3), then next DOWN would be (1,2) which is where I am now. But simultaneous moves: if I move DOWN to (1,1) and Snake #1 moves DOWN to (1,3), no collision.\n\nRIGHT also safe: Moves me toward center and multiple apples.\n\nLong-term plan: Target apple at (4,1) via DOWN then RIGHT moves, or (2,5) via UP/RIGHT. Since Snake #1 is near (2,5), maybe target (4,1) first. Moving DOWN positions toward (4,1). Moving RIGHT positions toward (2,5) but Snake #1 might get there first.\n\nI'll choose DOWN to aim for (4,1) while avoiding potential head-on risk with Snake #1.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Looking at the board, my head is at (4,1) and my body is at (3,1). Apples at (5,4), (8,1), (0,8), (3,2), (7,9). Enemy snake #1 head at (2,3) with body at (3,3) and (3,4). It has 2 apples.\n\nFirst, check each direction for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (4,2): empty, safe.\n- **DOWN** to (4,0): empty, safe.\n- **LEFT** to (3,1): my own body segment, would die.\n- **RIGHT** to (5,1): empty, safe.\n\nSo LEFT is eliminated.\n\nNow consider enemy's possible moves. Enemy head at (2,3). Possible moves:\n- UP to (2,4): empty.\n- DOWN to (2,2): empty (apple at (3,2) but that's not (2,2)).\n- LEFT to (1,3): empty.\n- RIGHT to (3,3): its own body, would die.\n\nSo enemy likely avoids RIGHT. It might move towards apple at (3,2) by moving DOWN? Actually (3,2) is down-right from (2,3), not directly down. It could move DOWN to (2,2) then next turn RIGHT to (3,2). Or RIGHT is suicide, so not. It might move LEFT or UP. But apple at (3,2) is close; maybe it moves DOWN to get closer.\n\nNow consider my safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**UP to (4,2)**: puts me closer to apple at (5,4) (two steps away in x, two in y). No immediate collision with enemy unless enemy moves to (4,2)? Enemy at (2,3) can't reach (4,2) in one move (max delta 1). So safe.\n\n**DOWN to (4,0)**: moves away from most apples, but safe. Could later go right towards apple at (8,1) along bottom.\n\n**RIGHT to (5,1)**: moves towards apple at (8,1) horizontally, and also closer to apple at (5,4) vertically. No immediate collision.\n\nNow consider potential head-on collisions: enemy could move to (3,3)? That's its body, so no. Could move to (3,2)? That's apple, but enemy at (2,3) moving DOWN goes to (2,2), not (3,2). So no direct head-on with my possible squares.\n\nBut I should also think about future traps. My body is at (3,1). If I move UP to (4,2), my body will be at (4,1) and (3,1). That leaves me space. If I move RIGHT to (5,1), my body becomes (4,1) and (3,1). Similar.\n\nI want to maximize apple eating. The closest apple is at (5,4) from (4,1): delta (1,3). Also (8,1) is delta (4,0). (0,8) far. (3,2) is delta (-1,1) but that's near enemy. (7,9) far.\n\nMoving RIGHT gets me closer to (8,1) and also sets up to go up towards (5,4). Moving UP gets me closer to (5,4). Both are reasonable.\n\nConsider enemy's likely move: It might go DOWN to (2,2) to approach apple at (3,2). Or LEFT to (1,3). If it goes DOWN, then next turn it could be at (2,2). That's not a direct threat to me.\n\nI think moving RIGHT is good because it keeps me on a path to (8,1) and also I can turn up later. Moving UP also fine.\n\nBut note: if I move RIGHT to (5,1), I'm adjacent to apple at (5,4) vertically? Actually (5,1) to (5,4) is 3 up. I could go up next turns.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT avoids moving into the center where enemy might go.\n\nLet's check if any move leads to a dead end: UP to (4,2) then possible next moves? Up to (4,3), left to (3,2) but that's apple, right to (5,2), down back to (4,1) but body there. So fine.\n\nRIGHT to (5,1) then next moves: up to (5,2), left to (4,1) body, right to (6,1), down to (5,0). So fine.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT to continue path towards apple at (8,1) and keep options open.\n\n**Plan for next turn**: After moving RIGHT, head at (5,1), body at (4,1) and (3,1). From there, consider moving UP to approach (5,4) or RIGHT to approach (8,1). Avoid moving LEFT into body. Monitor enemy position.\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #0 is at (5,1) and could threaten the apple area. I should secure the nearby apple while watching for enemy movement patterns. After getting (3,2), I'll need to plan a route to other apples while avoiding potential conflicts with Snake #0.\n\n**CURRENT TURN ANALYSIS:**\n\n**Position check:**\n- My head: (2,2), body: [(2,3), (3,3)]\n- Snake #0 head: (5,1), body: [(4,1)]\n- Apples: (5,4), (8,1), (0,8), (3,2), (7,9)\n\n**Direction safety assessment:**\n- UP: (2,3) - my body segment, would die\n- DOWN: (2,1) - empty, safe\n- LEFT: (1,2) - empty, safe\n- RIGHT: (3,2) - contains apple, safe\n\nUP is eliminated (into my own body at (2,3)).\n\n**Apple accessibility:**\nRIGHT to (3,2) gets me an apple immediately! This is highly valuable.\n\n**Enemy threat analysis:**\nSnake #0 at (5,1) can move UP to (5,2), DOWN to (5,0), LEFT to (4,1) (into its own body), or RIGHT to (6,1). Their move to (5,2) would put them 2 spaces away from me at (3,2), so minimal immediate threat.\n\n**Strategic evaluation:**\nRIGHT is clearly the best move - it immediately collects an apple at (3,2), giving me my 3rd apple. This extends my lead over Snake #0 (who has 1 apple) and grows my snake. Both DOWN and LEFT are safe alternatives but don't provide the immediate apple benefit.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #1 head is at (2,2) with body at (2,3) and (3,3). It has 2 apples.\n\nFirst, check each direction for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (5,2): empty, safe.\n- **DOWN** to (5,0): empty, safe.\n- **LEFT** to (4,1): my own body segment, would die.\n- **RIGHT** to (6,1): empty, safe.\n\nSo LEFT is eliminated.\n\nNow consider enemy's possible moves. Enemy head at (2,2). Possible moves:\n- UP to (2,3): its own body, would die.\n- DOWN to (2,1): empty.\n- LEFT to (1,2): empty.\n- RIGHT to (3,2): apple, safe (eating apple grows, so new tail appears where head was? Actually after eating, body extends, so next turn tail remains at old head position? But immediate move is safe).\n\nEnemy likely avoids UP (suicide). It might move RIGHT to eat apple at (3,2) or DOWN/LEFT.\n\nNow consider my safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**UP to (5,2)**: moves closer to apple at (5,4) (two steps up). No immediate collision with enemy unless enemy moves to (5,2) which is impossible in one move (enemy max delta 1). Safe.\n\n**DOWN to (5,0)**: moves away from most apples but keeps me alive. Could later go right along bottom toward apple at (8,1).\n\n**RIGHT to (6,1)**: moves toward apple at (8,1) horizontally. Also sets up potential to go up later. Safe.\n\nNow consider potential head-on collisions: enemy could move to (3,2) (apple), (2,1), or (1,2). My possible squares are (5,2), (5,0), (6,1). No overlap, so no direct head-on collision this turn.\n\nBut I should think about future traps. My body is at (4,1). If I move UP, my body becomes (5,1) and (4,1). That leaves me space to move left, right, or up next turn. If I move RIGHT, body becomes (5,1) and (4,1). Similar. If I move DOWN, body becomes (5,1) and (4,1).\n\nI want to maximize apple eating. The closest apple is at (5,4) from (5,1): delta (0,3). Also (8,1) is delta (3,0). (3,2) is close but near enemy. (7,9) far. (0,8) far.\n\nMoving UP gets me closer to (5,4). Moving RIGHT gets me closer to (8,1). Both are reasonable.\n\nConsider enemy's likely move: It will probably move RIGHT to eat apple at (3,2) because that's a free apple and avoids suicide. If it does, its head will be at (3,2) and it will grow by 1 segment (new tail at old head (2,2)? Actually after eating, the body extends: the head moves to apple, and a new segment is added at the old head position, so the body becomes [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]? Wait, initial body: head (2,2), body segments [(2,3), (3,3)]. After eating, head moves to (3,2), a new segment is added at (2,2) (old head), so body becomes [(3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]. That means the enemy will be longer and occupy (2,2) and (2,3) and (3,3). That could block some areas.\n\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (3,2), then next turn it could move UP to (3,3) but that's its body, DOWN to (3,1) empty, LEFT to (2,2) its body, RIGHT to (4,2) empty. So likely DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nNow, if I move UP to (5,2), I'm two steps away from enemy's possible move to (4,2) next turn? Enemy could move RIGHT to (4,2) from (3,2) if it chooses. That would put it adjacent to me at (5,2) horizontally. That could lead to head-on collision risk later.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,1), I'm farther from enemy and moving along bottom toward apple at (8,1). That seems safer.\n\nAlso, apple at (8,1) is on the same row as my head if I move RIGHT. I could potentially reach it in two moves: RIGHT to (6,1), then RIGHT to (7,1), then RIGHT to (8,1). That's three moves actually. But it's a clear path.\n\nMoving UP gets me closer to apple at (5,4) but that's also near the center where enemy might go after eating apple.\n\nGiven enemy is likely to eat apple at (3,2) and become longer, I should avoid getting too close. Moving RIGHT seems to keep distance and progress toward an apple.\n\nCheck follow-up moves after RIGHT: from (6,1), next turn I can go UP to (6,2), DOWN to (6,0), RIGHT to (7,1). LEFT to (5,1) would be my body (since body will be (5,1) and (4,1)). So three safe directions likely.\n\nAfter UP to (5,2): next turn I can go UP to (5,3), LEFT to (4,2), RIGHT to (6,2). DOWN to (5,1) would be body. Also three safe directions.\n\nBoth are okay.\n\nBut considering the board layout, there's an apple at (8,1) on the right edge, and no immediate threats there. Moving RIGHT seems like a solid choice to claim that apple while staying safe from the enemy.\n\n**Plan for next turn**: After moving RIGHT, head at (6,1), body at (5,1) and (4,1). From there, consider moving RIGHT again toward apple at (8,1) or UP to approach apple at (5,4) later. Monitor enemy's new position after it likely eats apple at (3,2).\n\nRIGHT",

The apple at (5,4) is also accessible if I go UP then RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy threat analysis:**\nSnake #0 at (7,1) is likely heading toward (8,1) apple. They pose minimal immediate threat to my position. Their possible moves won't conflict with my safe options this turn.\n\n**Strategic evaluation:**\nAll three directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) are safe. UP is optimal as it moves me toward the (2,4) apple while opening up future movement options. DOWN would take me away from the primary target, and RIGHT moves me toward the center but doesn't directly advance toward my nearest apple.\n\nUP",

Enemy snake #1 head is at (4,2) with body at (3,2), (2,2), (2,3). It has 3 apples.\n\nFirst, check each direction for immediate death:\n- **UP** to (7,2): empty, safe.\n- **DOWN** to (7,0): empty, safe.\n- **LEFT** to (6,1): my own body segment, would die.\n- **RIGHT** to (8,1): contains an apple, safe (eating apple grows tail next turn).\n\nSo LEFT is eliminated.\n\nNow consider enemy's possible moves. Enemy head at (4,2). Possible moves:\n- UP to (4,3): empty.\n- DOWN to (4,1): empty.\n- LEFT to (3,2): its own body, would die.\n- RIGHT to (5,2): empty.\nEnemy will avoid LEFT (suicide). It might move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nNow consider my safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**UP to (7,2)**: moves closer to apple at (7,9) and (5,4). No immediate collision with enemy unless enemy moves to (7,2) which is impossible in one move. Safe.\n\n**DOWN to (7,0)**: moves away from most apples but keeps me alive. Could later go right along bottom.\n\n**RIGHT to (8,1)**: moves onto apple at (8,1), I will eat it and grow. This is immediately beneficial.\n\nPotential head-on collisions: enemy could move to (5,2), (4,3), or (4,1). My possible squares are (7,2), (7,0), (8,1). No overlap, so no direct head-on collision this turn.\n\nEating the apple at (8,1) gives me a point and grows my tail by one segment next turn. That seems like the best immediate gain. It also moves me away from the enemy's area.\n\nConsider future moves: After moving RIGHT to (8,1) and eating the apple, my head will be at (8,1), my body will be [(7,1), (6,1)] plus a new tail segment (since I grow). My length becomes 3. From (8,1), next turn I can move UP to (8,2), DOWN to (8,0), or LEFT to (7,1) (which will be my neck, but my body will be at (7,1) and (6,1) and the new tail? Actually, after eating, my body becomes: head at (8,1), then (7,1), then (6,1). The new tail segment appears where the tail was? In typical snake rules, when you eat, you grow by adding a segment at the tail end next turn. So my tail will stay where it is, and my body lengthens. So next turn, my body will be [(8,1), (7,1), (6,1)]. Then possible moves from (8,1): UP (8,2), DOWN (8,0), LEFT (7,1) which is my own body (so not allowed), RIGHT (9,1) which is within board. So I'll have three safe directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). That's good.\n\nIf I move UP to (7,2), I don't get an apple immediately, but I move toward center. Enemy might move toward me. DOWN to (7,0) is safe but away from apples.\n\nGiven the clear benefit of eating the apple at (8,1) and the safety of the move, RIGHT is the best choice.\n\n**Plan for next turn**: After moving RIGHT and eating apple, my head will be at (8,1), body [(7,1), (6,1)]. Next turn, avoid moving LEFT into own body. Consider moving UP/DOWN/RIGHT to continue toward other apples while watching enemy movement.\n\nRIGHT",

So no head-on collision possible here.  \nUP seems safe.  \n\n**DOWN (7,1):**  \nEmpty, not off-board, not my body, not enemy body. Enemy cannot reach (7,1) in one move. Safe.  \n\n**LEFT (6,2):**  \nEmpty, not off-board, not my body, not enemy body. Enemy cannot reach (6,2) in one move. Safe.  \n\nSo UP, DOWN, LEFT all seem immediately safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Which move is strategically better?**  \n\nApples nearby:  \n- (5,2) is at y=2, x=5. From (7,2), LEFT twice gets there. But snake #1 is at (3,4) far away from (5,2) currently.  \n- (2,4) is far.  \n- (5,4) is closer to enemy maybe.  \n- (7,9) far north.  \n- (0,8) far.  \n\nClosest apple to me is (5,2).  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (6,2), next turn I could go LEFT again to (5,2) to eat apple. But need to check if enemy could interfere: enemy at (3,4) could move DOWN to (3,3) (own body), LEFT to (2,4) apple, RIGHT to (4,4), UP to (3,5). They can\u2019t reach (5,2) in one move from (3,4). They\u2019d need 2 moves: (3,4)\u2192(4,4)\u2192(5,4) or (3,4)\u2192(4,4)\u2192(5,4) not (5,2). Actually to get to (5,2) they\u2019d need (3,4)\u2192(4,4)\u2192(5,4)\u2192(5,3)\u2192(5,2) many moves. So apple (5,2) is safe for me to aim for.  \n\nBut going LEFT to (6,2) is fine.  \n\nUP to (7,3) takes me slightly away from (5,2) but opens more space maybe.  \n\nDOWN to (7,1) also away from apple but maybe safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Avoid future traps:**  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (6,2), my body will be at [(6,2), (7,2), (8,2), (8,1)] after move? Wait, growth only if eat apple. No apple at (6,2), so no growth. So new head (6,2), remove tail (8,1), body becomes: head (6,2), then (7,2), then (8,2). That leaves (8,1) empty. That\u2019s fine.  \n\nFrom (6,2) next turn options: UP (6,3), DOWN (6,1), LEFT (5,2) apple, RIGHT (7,2) my old head now body. So 3 safe moves likely. Good.  \n\nIf I go UP to (7,3), from there next turn: UP (7,4), DOWN (7,2) body, LEFT (6,3), RIGHT (8,3). 3 safe moves.  \n\nDOWN to (7,1): next turn UP (7,2) body, DOWN (7,0), LEFT (6,1), RIGHT (8,1) empty. Also 3 safe moves.  \n\nAll keep options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Consider enemy movement and head-on risk:**  \n\nEnemy at (3,4) might go LEFT to (2,4) to eat apple there, or UP to (3,5), or RIGHT to (4,4). No overlap with my possible moves. So no head-on risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Prefer move toward nearest apple:**  \n\nClosest apple is (5,2), Manhattan distance from (7,2) = |7-5|+|2-2|=2.  \nLEFT reduces distance to 1. UP/DOWN keep distance 2 or increase. So LEFT is best for apple gathering.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \n\nIf I go LEFT now to (6,2), next turn apple at (5,2) is reachable by LEFT again, but check if enemy could head-collide: enemy would be at earliest (4,4) or (2,4) etc., not (5,2). So likely safe to eat next turn. After eating, length 4, tail at (8,2), more space to maneuver.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** LEFT\n\nLEFT",

My body is trailing to the right (east) along y=2.\n\n**Apples:**  \n- (5,4) \u2013 above me by 2 steps.  \n- (0,8) \u2013 far top-left.  \n- (7,9) \u2013 far top-right.  \n- (1,2) \u2013 left along my row (y=2), 4 cells west.  \n- (8,9) \u2013 far top-right.\n\n**Enemy snake #1:** head at (2,5), body segments at [(2,4),(3,4),(3,3),(4,3)], length 5 (head + 4 body parts). It is northwest of me.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Check each direction for immediate death:**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (5,3).  \n  - Not off board (0\u20139 valid).  \n  - Not my own body: my body cells are (6,2),(7,2),(8,2) \u2014 none at (5,3).  \n  - Not enemy body: enemy body cells are (2,4),(3,4),(3,3),(4,3) \u2014 none at (5,3).  \n  \u2705 Safe.\n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5,1).  \n  - In bounds.  \n  - Not my body.  \n  - Not enemy body.  \n  \u2705 Safe.\n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4,2).  \n  - In bounds.  \n  - Not my body.  \n  - Not enemy body.  \n  \u2705 Safe.\n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,2).  \n  - In bounds.  \n  - My body cell (6,2) is currently my neck (first body segment after head). However, my tail is at (8,2) and my body will shift forward this turn if I move \u2014 but **simultaneous movement** means my neck (6,2) will move to where my head is now (5,2) only after I move. So (6,2) will still be occupied by my body when my head tries to move there \u2192 collision with myself.  \n  \u274c **Not safe** (would die).\n\nSo RIGHT is eliminated.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy\u2019s possible moves and head-on collisions:**  \nEnemy head at (2,5). Possible moves for enemy: UP\u2192(2,6), DOWN\u2192(2,4) (but (2,4) is its own body \u2014 would die), LEFT\u2192(1,5), RIGHT\u2192(3,5).  \nEnemy will likely avoid DOWN (suicide), so likely UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nMy safe moves: UP (5,3), DOWN (5,1), LEFT (4,2).  \nCheck if any of my safe moves land on same cell as enemy\u2019s possible moves this turn:\n\n- Enemy UP (2,6) \u2013 nowhere near my moves.  \n- Enemy LEFT (1,5) \u2013 nowhere near my moves.  \n- Enemy RIGHT (3,5) \u2013 nowhere near my moves.  \nNo head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Evaluate apple proximity and future options:**  \n\n- **UP (5,3)**: gets me closer to apple at (5,4) (1 step away next turn). Leaves me room to go UP again to (5,4) next turn if safe. Also from (5,3), possible next moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN would go back to (5,2) which will be empty after this turn). Good future flexibility.\n\n- **DOWN (5,1)**: moves away from nearest apple (5,4). From (5,1), next moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN \u2014 all likely safe unless enemy moves there. But less progress toward apple.\n\n- **LEFT (4,2)**: moves toward apple at (1,2) but still 3 steps away horizontally. From (4,2), next moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 all likely safe. But apple at (1,2) is along same row, so moving LEFT repeatedly could reach it.\n\nApple at (5,4) is closer (2 steps) than apple at (1,2) (4 steps). Also, moving UP positions me to possibly eat (5,4) next turn if enemy doesn\u2019t interfere.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nWe have 3 apples vs enemy\u2019s 4 apples. Need to catch up. Apple at (5,4) is prime target. After eating it, consider moving toward center to avoid being trapped along edges. Keep an eye on enemy head movement to avoid future head-on collisions. If enemy goes for (5,4) next turn, we may need to divert to (1,2) or other apples.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gets me closer to nearest apple, keeps future options open, and is safe this turn.\n\nUP",

If I go RIGHT to (4,5), I'm positioned to move DOWN to (4,4) then LEFT to (5,4) to capture it. Snake #0 is at (5,3) and could also target this apple, but they'd need to move UP then LEFT.\n\nUP moves me toward the cluster of apples in the top right but is slower. Given that I'm ahead in apples (4 vs 3), I should prioritize securing nearby apples while maintaining safety.\n\n**Enemy snake analysis:**\nSnake #0 would likely move UP to (5,4) this turn to claim that apple, which puts them at risk if I move RIGHT. However, since I can't reach (5,4) this turn anyway, the smarter play is to position myself to potentially block Snake #0 or claim the apple next turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nThe (5,4) apple is highly contested. Moving RIGHT positions me to either claim it next turn if Snake #0 doesn't, or to challenge their position. If Snake #0 takes the apple, I can pivot toward the upper board apples. UP is safer but slower. With my lead, aggressive but calculated positioning is better than passive play.\n\nRIGHT",

It is north-west of me.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Check each direction for immediate death:**  \n\n- **UP** \u2192 (5,4).  \n  - In bounds.  \n  - Not my body: my body cells are (5,2),(6,2),(7,2).  \n  - Not enemy body: enemy body cells are (2,5),(2,4),(3,4),(3,3).  \n  \u2705 Safe.  \n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5,2).  \n  - In bounds.  \n  - Currently occupied by my body at (5,2). After simultaneous movement, my neck (5,2) will move to (5,3)? Wait \u2014 careful: my body list is [(5,2),(6,2),(7,2)]. The first body segment (5,2) is directly below my head. If I move DOWN to (5,2), I would be moving into my own neck cell before it moves. In simultaneous movement, all heads move first, then bodies shift. So if I move DOWN to (5,2), that cell is currently occupied by my own body segment \u2192 collision.  \n  \u274c **Not safe** (would die).  \n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4,3).  \n  - In bounds.  \n  - Not my body.  \n  - Not enemy body.  \n  \u2705 Safe.  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,3).  \n  - In bounds.  \n  - Not my body.  \n  - Not enemy body.  \n  \u2705 Safe.  \n\nSo DOWN is eliminated.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy\u2019s possible moves and head-on collisions:**  \nEnemy head at (3,5). Possible moves: UP\u2192(3,6), DOWN\u2192(3,4) (occupied by its own body at (3,4) \u2192 suicide), LEFT\u2192(2,5) (occupied by its own body at (2,5) \u2192 suicide), RIGHT\u2192(4,5).  \nEnemy only safe move is RIGHT to (4,5).  \n\nMy safe moves: UP (5,4), LEFT (4,3), RIGHT (6,3).  \nCheck if any collide with enemy\u2019s only safe move (4,5): none do. No head-on risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Evaluate apple proximity and future options:**  \n\n- **UP (5,4)**: lands directly on apple \u2192 eat apple, grow to length 5. After eating, my head stays at (5,4), tail stays at (7,2) (since growth adds segment at head). Next turn from (5,4), possible moves: DOWN (back to (5,3) \u2013 empty), LEFT (4,4), RIGHT (6,4). Good options.  \n\n- **LEFT (4,3)**: moves away from nearest apple (5,4). From (4,3), next moves: UP (4,4), DOWN (4,2), LEFT (3,3) (enemy body at (3,3) but could move?), RIGHT (5,3). Still safe options but delays apple.  \n\n- **RIGHT (6,3)**: moves away from apple (5,4). From (6,3), next moves: UP (6,4), DOWN (6,2) (my old body cell, but after shift will be empty?), LEFT (5,3), RIGHT (7,3). Also safe but not toward apple.  \n\nEating apple at (5,4) brings me to 4 apples vs enemy\u2019s 4 apples (tie). Also puts me in a central position with open space.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nIf I eat apple (5,4) this turn, next turn consider moving DOWN to (5,3) to avoid being trapped along top edge, then work toward other apples like (1,2) or (0,8). Watch enemy movement\u2014its head will be at (4,5) next turn, which is close to my position. Avoid moving toward (4,5) to prevent head-on collision risk on future turns.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gets the apple, ties score with enemy, and is safe.  \n\nUP",

Possible moves:  \n- UP\u2192(5,6) \u2013 safe.  \n- DOWN\u2192(5,4) \u2013 safe (not occupied).  \n- LEFT\u2192(4,5) \u2013 occupied by its own body at (4,5) \u2192 suicide.  \n- RIGHT\u2192(6,5) \u2013 safe.  \n\nEnemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nMy safe moves: UP (6,5), DOWN (6,3), RIGHT (7,4).  \n\nCheck for head-on collisions:  \n- If I go UP to (6,5) and enemy goes RIGHT to (6,5) \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 both die.  \n- If I go DOWN to (6,3) \u2013 no enemy move can reach (6,3) this turn.  \n- If I go RIGHT to (7,4) \u2013 no enemy move can reach (7,4) this turn.  \n\nSo UP carries risk of head-on collision if enemy chooses RIGHT. DOWN and RIGHT have no head-on risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Evaluate apple proximity and future options:**  \n\nApples: (0,8) far NW, (7,9) far NE, (1,2) SW, (8,9) far NE, (9,5) E.  \n\n- **UP (6,5)**: moves toward apple (7,9) direction, but risk of head-on with enemy RIGHT. From (6,5), next moves open but close to enemy head.  \n- **DOWN (6,3)**: moves toward apple (1,2) direction, away from enemy. From (6,3), next moves: UP (6,4), DOWN (6,2), LEFT (5,3), RIGHT (7,3). Likely safe next turn.  \n- **RIGHT (7,4)**: moves toward apple (9,5) and (8,9), away from enemy. From (7,4), next moves: UP (7,5), DOWN (7,3), LEFT (6,4), RIGHT (8,4). Good options.  \n\nGiven enemy has multiple safe moves, assuming it will avoid suicide, it might go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. If it goes RIGHT to (6,5) and I go UP, we collide. To avoid gambling, choose moves with zero head-on risk: DOWN or RIGHT.  \n\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT:  \n- RIGHT moves toward two apples (9,5) and (8,9) and keeps me in open space.  \n- DOWN moves toward one apple (1,2) but goes into more crowded area near my own tail and enemy's tail.  \n\nRIGHT seems better for apple access and future mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nMove RIGHT to (7,4) this turn. Next turn, consider moving UP toward apple (9,5) or (8,9) while monitoring enemy position. If enemy moves RIGHT to (6,5), it will be adjacent; avoid moving LEFT into it. Prefer to collect eastern apples while staying alive and maintaining distance from enemy head.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT is safe from immediate death, has no head-on collision risk this turn, and moves toward multiple apples with good future options.  \n\nRIGHT",

This keeps me in strong contention for the cluster while maintaining good board position.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nAfter reaching (5,9), prioritize securing (7,9) or (8,9).

Body: [(8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4)].  \nEnemy body: [(5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)].  \n\nCheck each direction:  \n- **UP** \u2192 (8,6): In bounds (y=6). Not my body. Not enemy body. \u2705 Safe.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8,4): Occupied by my body at (8,4) (my neck). After simultaneous movement, my neck will move to (8,5) if I stay? Wait: if I move DOWN to (8,4), that cell currently contains my neck segment. Since all snakes move at once, my neck will move from (8,4) to wherever snake 0\u2019s second segment moves (depends on my move). But the rule says: if your head moves into any snake\u2019s body (including your own), you die. At the start of the turn, (8,4) is occupied by my body. Moving into it is suicide. \u274c Not safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7,5): In bounds. Not my body. Not enemy body. \u2705 Safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,5): In bounds. Not my body. Not enemy body. \u2705 Safe.  \n\nSo DOWN is eliminated.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy\u2019s possible moves and head-on collisions**  \nEnemy head at (5,8). Enemy body: [(5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (4,5)].  \n\nEnemy safe moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (5,9): In bounds, not its body, not my body. \u2705 Safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,7): Occupied by its own body at (5,7) \u2192 suicide. \u274c Not safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,8): In bounds, not its body, not my body. \u2705 Safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,8): In bounds, not its body, not my body. \u2705 Safe.  \n\nEnemy safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nMy safe moves: UP (8,6), LEFT (7,5), RIGHT (9,5).\n\nCheck head-on collisions:  \n- If I go UP to (8,6) and enemy goes RIGHT to (6,8): no collision.  \n- If I go LEFT to (7,5) and enemy goes UP to (5,9) or RIGHT to (6,8) or LEFT to (4,8): no collision.  \n- If I go RIGHT to (9,5) and enemy goes UP/LEFT/RIGHT: no collision.  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and future options**  \nApples: (0,8), (7,9), (1,2), (8,9), (9,5).  \n\n- **UP (8,6)**: Moves toward (7,9) and (8,9). From (8,6), next moves: UP (8,7), DOWN (8,5), LEFT (7,6), RIGHT (9,6). Good options.  \n- **LEFT (7,5)**: Moves toward center, away from most apples except (7,9) is north-west. From (7,5), next moves: UP (7,6), DOWN (7,4), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5). Still decent.  \n- **RIGHT (9,5)**: Adjacent to apple at (9,5)? Wait, apple at (9,5) is at same x=9, y=5. My head is at (8,5). RIGHT goes to (9,5) which contains an apple! \u2705 Eating apple this turn if I move RIGHT. That would grow me by 1 segment next turn.  \n\nRIGHT immediately collects an apple. That\u2019s highly valuable.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Risk of moving RIGHT into (9,5)**  \nCell (9,5) is currently empty (board shows \u2018A\u2019 for apple at (9,5)). No snake body there. Enemy head at (5,8) cannot reach (9,5) in one move. So no head-on collision.  \nAfter eating, my length increases, but my tail remains in place until next moves? Actually, growth means next turn my tail doesn\u2019t move, so my body elongates. That could limit future mobility slightly, but worth it for +1 apple.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note**  \nIf I take RIGHT now, I get apple (9,5). Next turn my head will be at (9,5), body longer. Then possible moves: UP (9,6), DOWN (9,4), LEFT (8,5). DOWN (9,4) might be safe depending on enemy. Need to avoid trapping myself near right edge. But getting to 5 apples vs enemy\u2019s 4 gives lead.\n\nUP and LEFT are safe but don\u2019t get apple immediately. RIGHT gets apple now.\n\nGiven win condition is most apples by turn 150 or first to 50, collecting now is good. Also, if I get to 5 apples and enemy stays at 4, I\u2019m ahead.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT is safe, collects an apple this turn, and gives me an apple lead. Choose RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #0 may try to cut me off. Watch their movement carefully - if they move LEFT toward (8,6), they could threaten the area. Consider DOWN to (7,8) or RIGHT to (8,9) depending on safety. Avoid getting trapped in the top-right corner.\n\nRIGHT",

My body occupies: (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (8,4), (7,4).\n- Enemy body occupies: (6,9), (5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6).\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Check each possible move for immediate death.**\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (8,7)\n   - Check board bounds: Y=7 is within 0\u20139.\n   - Check my own body: My body cells: (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (8,4), (7,4). (8,7) not in list.\n   - Check enemy body: Enemy body: (6,9), (5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6). (8,7) not in list.\n   - Also need to consider enemy head movement possibilities: enemy head at (7,9) could move DOWN to (7,8), LEFT to (6,9) (occupied by its own body), RIGHT to (8,9) (apple), UP to (7,10) invalid.\n   - Possible head-on collision: If enemy moves RIGHT to (8,9), that's different from my (8,7). If enemy moves DOWN to (7,8), not same cell. So no guaranteed head-on collision.\n   - UP seems safe for immediate move.\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (8,5)\n   - My own body: (8,5) is in my body (third segment). Immediate death. Eliminate.\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (7,6)\n   - Bounds OK.\n   - My body: (7,6) not in my body list.\n   - Enemy body: (7,6) not in enemy body list.\n   - Head-on check: Enemy could move LEFT to (6,9)? Wait, from (7,9) LEFT is (6,9) which is its own body, so not allowed. Enemy could move DOWN to (7,8), RIGHT to (8,9), UP invalid. So enemy won't be at (7,6).\n   - LEFT seems safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,6)\n   - My body: (9,6) is my second segment. Immediate death. Eliminate.\n\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for future options and apple proximity.**\n\n**UP to (8,7):**\n- Adjacent cells next turn from (8,7): UP\u2192(8,8), DOWN\u2192(8,6) (currently my head's position, will be empty after move unless enemy moves into it), LEFT\u2192(7,7), RIGHT\u2192(9,7).\n- From (8,7), closest apples: (8,9) is 2 steps away (UP UP), (4,8) is 4 steps away, (0,8) far, (1,2) far, (9,1) far.\n- Danger: Enemy at (7,9) might go RIGHT to (8,9) to eat apple. If I go UP twice, I could meet enemy at (8,9) if enemy eats apple there this turn and stays? Let's check: If enemy moves RIGHT to (8,9) this turn, eats apple, grows. Its new head at (8,9), body adds segment at old tail? Actually, after eating, growth happens next turn, so its length stays 6 for now, but next turn it will be 7.\n- If I go UP to (8,7), then next turn UP to (8,8), enemy could be at (8,9) or (7,9) or elsewhere. Possible head-on if enemy moves LEFT from (8,9) to (8,8) same time I move UP to (8,8). But that's speculative.\n\n**LEFT to (7,6):**\n- Adjacent cells next turn from (7,6): UP\u2192(7,7), DOWN\u2192(7,5), LEFT\u2192(6,6), RIGHT\u2192(8,6) (old head position).\n- Apples nearby: (4,8) is 4 steps, (1,2) far, (0,8) far, (8,9) far, (9,1) far.\n- From (7,6), I'm closer to center, more open space.\n\nChecking board: My body blocks some areas. Currently my tail at (7,4). If I go LEFT to (7,6), my body will be: head (7,6), then segments: (8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (8,4), (7,4) will be tail? Wait, need to update body after move: new head at (7,6), old head (8,6) becomes second segment, old second segment (9,6) becomes third, etc., tail (7,4) removed if no apple eaten. So new body: (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (8,4) \u2014 tail at (8,4). Actually let's trace: current body: head (8,6), body2 (9,6), body3 (9,5), body4 (8,5), body5 (8,4), body6 (7,4). Moving LEFT to (7,6): new head (7,6), add (8,6) as new segment2, (9,6) segment3, (9,5) segment4, (8,5) segment5, (8,4) segment6, tail (7,4) removed. So body occupies: (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (8,4).\n\nThat means (7,5) is free, (6,6) free, etc. More space on left side.\n\nEnemy at (7,9) is far.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Prefer move that keeps more future options.**\n\nFrom (8,7) (UP move):\n- Next turn possible moves: UP to (8,8) \u2013 check if free: yes currently. DOWN to (8,6) \u2013 will be free (old head pos). LEFT to (7,7) \u2013 free. RIGHT to (9,7) \u2013 free. So 4 possible directions next turn.\n\nFrom (7,6) (LEFT move):\n- Next turn possible: UP (7,7) free, DOWN (7,5) free, LEFT (6,6) free, RIGHT (8,6) free. Also 4 possible.\n\nBoth keep good options.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity.**\n\nUP: Closest apple (8,9) is 2 steps.\nLEFT: Closest apple (4,8) is 5 steps away Manhattan, (1,2) far.\n\nSo UP is better for getting an apple quickly.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Risk of head-on collision.**\n\nIf I go UP to (8,7), enemy could go DOWN to (7,8) or RIGHT to (8,9). No overlap with my cell this turn.\n\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (8,9) and eats apple, next turn it might move LEFT to (8,8) or DOWN to (7,9) etc. If I go UP again to (8,8), possible collision if enemy goes LEFT to (8,8). But that's next turn's decision; I could avoid then.\n\nLEFT move: enemy unlikely to reach (7,6) soon.\n\nBoth seem safe this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Long-term plan note.**\n\nWe're tied at 5 apples each. Need to outlive enemy and collect apples faster. Enemy is near apple (8,9). If enemy eats it, they'll be at 6 apples. I should try to get (4,8) apple maybe, but (8,9) is closer to me if I go UP twice. But enemy might get it first if they go RIGHT this turn. Let's check: Enemy at (7,9), apple at (8,9). Enemy can move RIGHT to (8,9) and eat it. So maybe better to let them have it and avoid collision risk, instead target (4,8) or (0,8). But (0,8) is far top-left.\n\nGiven enemy's body blocks (6,9), (5,9), etc., enemy's only safe moves: RIGHT to (8,9) (apple), DOWN to (7,8) (free). LEFT to (6,9) is own body, UP invalid. So enemy likely goes RIGHT to eat apple or DOWN to avoid risk. If enemy goes RIGHT, they'll grow next turn, length 7, and be at (8,9). That could block my access to top-right area.\n\nMaybe I should go LEFT to (7,6) to move toward center and (4,8) apple, avoiding conflict.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:** Both UP and LEFT safe. UP gets me closer to (8,9) but risk enemy there. LEFT safer and opens path to center apples.\n\nI'll choose LEFT for safety and positioning toward (4,8).\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (7,6), assess moving toward (4,8) via (7,7) or (6,6). Keep away from enemy likely path to (8,9).\n\nLEFT",
