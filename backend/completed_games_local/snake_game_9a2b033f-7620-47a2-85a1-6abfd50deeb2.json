UP: (0,1) - My own body (would kill me)\n2. DOWN: (-1,0) - Off the board (invalid)\n3. LEFT: (-1,0) - Off the board (invalid)\n4. RIGHT: (1,0) - Enemy body (would kill me)\n\nSafety check:\n- UP to (0,1): Invalid (hits own body)\n- DOWN to (-1,0): Invalid (off board)\n- LEFT to (-1,0): Invalid (off board)\n- RIGHT to (1,0): Invalid (hits enemy body)\n\nNo safe moves available. This means I'm trapped and will die this turn.\n\nHowever, let me double-check the board state to ensure I'm not missing anything. Looking at the board:\n\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 T . . . A . . . . .\n 5 T . . . . . . . . .\n 4 T . . . . . . . A .\n 3 T T T 0 . . . A . .\n 2 T T . . . A . . . .\n 1 T T . . . . . . . .\n 0 1 T T T . . . . . A\n```\n\nMy head is at (0,0), and my body occupies (0,1) to (0,6). The enemy body occupies (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), etc. So indeed, all four directions are blocked.\n\nSince there are no safe moves, I have no choice but to accept that I will die this turn. The game will continue with the enemy snake still alive.\n\nRIGHT",
