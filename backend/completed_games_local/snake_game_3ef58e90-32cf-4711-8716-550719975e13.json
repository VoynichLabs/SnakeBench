Enemy is at (2,6), could move UP to (2,7), LEFT to (1,6), DOWN to (2,5), RIGHT to (3,6). So enemy cannot reach (0,8) in one move. Safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 6) \u2014 empty, safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (-1, 7) \u2014 off board, invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 7) \u2014 empty, safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n**Strategic thinking:**  \nUP gets apple immediately (grow to length 2), but then my head is at (0,8) and body at (0,7). That\u2019s fine.  \nEnemy is at (2,6), not an immediate threat.  \n\nIf I go UP, next turn I\u2019ll have to avoid moving back into my new body at (0,7). That still leaves 2 or 3 safe moves from (0,8).  \n\nDOWN or RIGHT don\u2019t get apple, but keep flexibility. However, early game, growing is important to avoid being easily trapped later.  \n\nAlso, apple at (0,8) is closest to me. If I don\u2019t take it, enemy might later get it, but enemy is far now.  \n\n**Potential head-on collision check:**  \nEnemy possible moves from (2,6):  \n- UP to (2,7) \u2014 not my UP target (0,8)  \n- DOWN to (2,5)  \n- LEFT to (1,6)  \n- RIGHT to (3,6)  \n\nNo overlap with my possible destinations (0,8), (0,6), (1,7). So no risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nTake apple at (0,8) now to grow. Next, consider moving toward center or other apples while avoiding boxing myself in corners. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s likely path toward nearest apple (maybe (0,1) or (8,1) for them).  \n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Safe this turn.\n\nNo move causes an immediate collision with the enemy head this turn (enemy at (0,7) cannot reach any of our candidate cells in one step). So I must prefer moves that keep options open and advance toward reachable apples.\n\nStrategy reasoning:\n- The apple at (0,8) is the nearest. The enemy at (0,7) can take that apple next turn by moving UP, so contesting it may be futile. Still, moving toward the left side (toward x=0) reduces distance to that cluster of apples (0,8 and 0,1).\n- LEFT to (1,6) and UP to (2,7) both reduce distance to (0,8) from 4 to 3. LEFT also moves me closer to other left-side apples and keeps several open follow-up moves (up, down, left, right are available from (1,6)). It does not create any immediate risk of head-on collision with the enemy.\n- DOWN would move me away from nearest apples; RIGHT moves me away from the left-side apples as well.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Move left to get closer to the left-side apples while keeping escape routes open.\n- If the enemy takes (0,8), pivot to either (0,1) or swing around to other apples depending on their moves and openings.\n- Avoid getting boxed in along the left edge; keep at least 2 escape directions when possible.\n\nLEFT",

Wait, if I move RIGHT now to (1, 8), my body moves: head to (1, 8), tail from (0, 7) disappears (since no apple eaten), so body becomes just [(1, 8), (0, 8)]? No \u2014 correction: when no apple eaten, snake moves forward: head to new position, each segment moves into previous segment\u2019s old position. So after moving RIGHT: head (1, 8), body segment 1 at old head (0, 8). So body = [(1, 8), (0, 8)].  \n\nThen next turn from (1, 8):  \n- UP to (1, 9) \u2014 empty.  \n- DOWN to (1, 7) \u2014 empty.  \n- LEFT to (0, 8) \u2014 my body, not safe.  \n- RIGHT to (2, 8) \u2014 empty.  \n\nSo from (1, 8) next turn, 3 safe moves. Better flexibility.  \n\n**Strategic note:**  \nGoing UP to (0, 9) corners me with only 1 safe move next turn (RIGHT to (1, 9)), which is dangerous. Going RIGHT to (1, 8) keeps more options open and moves toward center.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nAfter moving to (1, 8), consider moving toward apple at (6,5) or (8,1) via safe path, while watching enemy movement. Avoid being predictable.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nRIGHT",

UP reduces options.  \nDOWN or RIGHT both keep flexibility.  \nApple at (6,5) is reachable via moving right/down over several turns.  \nEnemy is short, so not a huge threat yet, but keep distance.\n\nBetter to move toward center/open space: RIGHT to (2,8) moves toward board center and apple (6,5) direction.  \nDOWN to (1,7) moves toward apple (0,1) but that\u2019s a long vertical path with enemy possibly in middle rows soon.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT gives more central position and good next-move options.  \nDOWN also okay but puts me closer to enemy\u2019s possible immediate path.\n\nI\u2019ll choose RIGHT.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

That\u2019s a bit constrained but not immediately fatal.  \n\n**DOWN to (7,7):**  \nBody: [(7,7), (6,8)].  \nFrom (7,7): UP (7,8) my body (dead), DOWN (7,6) empty, LEFT (6,7) empty, RIGHT (8,7) empty.  \n3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Moves away from nearest apple but keeps options open.  \n\n**RIGHT to (8,8):**  \nBody: [(8,8), (6,8)] (gap in body since length 2).  \nFrom (8,8): UP (8,9) empty, DOWN (8,7) empty, LEFT (7,8) my body (dead), RIGHT (9,8) empty.  \n3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Moves toward apple (8,1) eventually but not directly.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of enemy cutting me off:**  \nEnemy at (6,4) is far enough not to threaten me directly next turn unless I move into its path.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP gives immediate apple (score +1, length +1) but reduces next-turn safe moves to 2.  \nRIGHT and DOWN keep more options next turn but delay apple.  \n\nGiven the game is long (turn 8/150) and I\u2019m only length 2, growing now is beneficial to have more space for body avoidance later.  \nAlso, if I don\u2019t take (7,9), enemy might later get it, though enemy is far currently.  \n\nI think taking the apple now is good. After eating, I\u2019ll be at (7,9) with body behind me, and can go LEFT (6,9) next turn to move toward center.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn after UP:**  \nFrom (7,9) with body [(7,9),(7,8),(6,8)], safe moves: LEFT (6,9) or RIGHT (8,9). Choose LEFT to go toward board center and away from top edge trap.  \n\nUP",

Wait, no growth unless apple eaten, so tail stays at (7, 9) after this move? Let\u2019s track: current body: head (8,8), then (8,9), then (7,9). After moving DOWN to (8,7), new body: head (8,7), then (8,8), then (8,9). Tail (7,9) is gone. So next turn from (8,7): UP (8,8) \u2192 my body (dead), DOWN (8,6) empty, LEFT (7,7) empty, RIGHT (9,7) empty. So 3 safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Good.\n\n**LEFT to (7, 8):**  \nFrom (7, 8) next turn: body: head (7,8), then (8,8), then (8,9).  \nUP (7,9) \u2192 empty (tail was at (7,9) but now moved? Wait, tail was (7,9) and is now gone, so (7,9) empty), DOWN (7,7) empty, LEFT (6,8) empty, RIGHT (8,8) \u2192 my body (dead). So 3 safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. Good.\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 8):**  \nFrom (9, 8) next turn: body: head (9,8), then (8,8), then (8,9).  \nUP (9,9) empty, DOWN (9,7) empty, LEFT (8,8) \u2192 my body (dead), RIGHT off board (dead). So 2 safe moves: UP, DOWN. Less flexible but not terrible.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Consider enemy movement and apple strategy:**  \nEnemy at (6,1) might go DOWN to (6,0) to eat apple there.  \nI want to stay safe but also move toward apples. Apple at (8,1) is below me, apple at (6,0) is left-down.  \nGoing DOWN (8,7) keeps me in column 8, moving toward (8,1).  \nGoing LEFT (7,8) moves me toward center and possibly toward (6,0) or (1,3) later.\n\nBut enemy is near (6,0), so competing for that apple could be risky if we meet.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nAll three moves are safe now and give decent options next turn.  \nRIGHT (9,8) puts me near right edge, slightly limiting.  \nLEFT (7,8) moves toward center and more open space.  \nDOWN (8,7) moves toward apple (8,1) but also leaves me near right wall.\n\nBetter to go LEFT toward center for more future flexibility and possibly intercept apples (1,3) or (0,1) later while avoiding enemy near (6,0).\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn after LEFT:**  \nFrom (7,8), safe moves likely UP/DOWN/LEFT. I\u2019ll assess then whether to go down toward (8,1) or left toward (1,3), watching enemy\u2019s position.\n\nLEFT",

Avoid trapping myself in top row.  \n\nUP",

Risky \u2014 top row reduces options.  \n\n**DOWN to (3, 7):**  \nNext turn body: head (3,7), then (3,8), (4,8), (4,7), (5,7).  \nFrom (3, 7):  \nUP (3, 8) \u2192 my body (dead).  \nDOWN (3, 6) \u2192 empty.  \nLEFT (2, 7) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT (4, 7) \u2192 my body (dead).  \nOnly 2 safe moves: DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**LEFT to (2, 8):**  \nNext turn body: head (2,8), then (3,8), (4,8), (4,7), (5,7).  \nFrom (2, 8):  \nUP (2, 9) \u2192 empty.  \nDOWN (2, 7) \u2192 empty.  \nLEFT (1, 8) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT (3, 8) \u2192 my body (dead).  \n3 safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\nLEFT again gives best future flexibility (3 safe moves).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is at (5, 1) and may move toward (3, 0) or (1, 0) or (0, 1).  \nIf I go DOWN now, I move toward (3, 0) but enemy is closer to it \u2014 risk of collision later.  \nIf I go LEFT, I move toward (1, 3) and keep flexibility.  \nUP is too limiting.  \n\nLEFT seems best for safety and options.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP (3, 9) \u2192 2 safe moves next turn, risky.  \nDOWN (3, 7) \u2192 2 safe moves next turn, moves toward contested apple.  \nLEFT (2, 8) \u2192 3 safe moves next turn, moves toward (1, 3) while keeping distance from enemy.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose LEFT for flexibility and safety.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 8), consider moving DOWN toward (1, 3) if enemy isn\u2019t too close, else go UP/LEFT to stay flexible.

So enemy is closer to (1, 3) than I am.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future move flexibility after each safe move:**  \n\n**UP to (2, 9):**  \nNext turn body: head (2,9), then (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (4,7).  \nFrom (2, 9):  \nUP \u2192 off board (dead).  \nDOWN (2, 8) \u2192 my body (dead).  \nLEFT (1, 9) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT (3, 9) \u2192 empty.  \nOnly 2 safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT.

Going DOWN from (2, 8) moves me toward (1, 3) but enemy likely gets there first, maybe I can intercept later if enemy goes elsewhere.  \nGoing LEFT from (2, 8) moves me toward left side apples (0,1) and (1,0) eventually, but they are far.  \n\n(8, 6) is far but uncontested \u2014 enemy far away at bottom.

Enemy at (4, 1) likely moves toward (3, 0) or (1, 3) or (0, 1).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP is too limiting.  \nDOWN gives flexibility and moves toward middle board, maybe toward (1, 3) but not directly into enemy.  \nLEFT gives flexibility but moves toward left edge, which could limit later.  \n\nI think DOWN is slightly better because:  \n- It keeps me in central rows (y=7) with more space to maneuver.  \n- From (2, 7) I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN next turn.  \n- Avoids top row trap.  \n- Not rushing into contested apple immediately.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 7), assess enemy position. If enemy moves toward (1, 3), maybe go LEFT toward (1, 7) and then down toward (1, 6) etc., or go RIGHT to (3, 7) to approach (8, 6) later. Keep options open, avoid head-on paths.  \n\nDOWN",

Enemy at (1, 0) is |1-1| + |0-3| = 0 + 3 = 3 steps from (1, 3). I\u2019m closer.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future move flexibility after each safe move:**  \n\n**DOWN to (2, 3):**  \nNext turn body: head (2,3), then (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7).  \nFrom (2, 3):  \nUP (2, 4) \u2192 my body (dead).  \nDOWN (2, 2) \u2192 empty.  \nLEFT (1, 3) \u2192 apple (safe, will grow).  \nRIGHT (3, 3) \u2192 empty.  \n3 safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.

Good.  \n\nAll three safe moves give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple and enemy avoidance:**  \nEnemy can go UP to (1, 1) or LEFT to (0, 0).  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (0, 0), it\u2019s 3 steps from (1, 3) via (0, 1) apple or (1, 1) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (1, 3).  \nIf enemy goes UP to (1, 1), it\u2019s 2 steps from (1, 3) via (1, 2) \u2192 (1, 3).  \n\nI\u2019m 2 steps from (1, 3). If I go LEFT to (1, 4), next turn I can go DOWN to (1, 3) and eat it.  \nIf I go DOWN to (2, 3), next turn I can go LEFT to (1, 3) and eat it.  \n\nBut if enemy goes UP to (1, 1) now, then next turn enemy could go to (1, 2) (or (0, 1) apple). If enemy goes to (1, 2), then on the turn I move to (1, 3), enemy could also move to (1, 3) \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 both die. Enemy length 7 vs my 4, so I lose if both die.  \n\nThus, to avoid tie at (1, 3), I should either:  \n1) Get to (1, 3) one turn before enemy could, or  \n2) Let enemy take it if risky.  \n\nFrom (1, 4), I can eat (1, 3) next turn. Enemy from (1, 1) can eat (1, 3) in 2 moves, so if enemy is at (1, 1) now, we\u2019d arrive at (1, 3) same turn if I go LEFT now \u2192 DOWN next. That\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nFrom (2, 3), I can eat (1, 3) next turn. Enemy from (1, 1) would take 2 moves, so again same-turn arrival possible if enemy moves toward it.  \n\nActually, if enemy is at (1, 1) next turn, and I\u2019m at (2, 3) next turn, enemy could go (1, 2), I go (1, 3) \u2192 no collision yet. Then enemy could go (1, 3) when I\u2019m already there? No, simultaneous moves: if I\u2019m at (1, 3) already, enemy moving into it kills them, not me (their head into my body). Wait, rule: \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\" So if I\u2019m on (1, 3) and enemy moves onto it, they die. That\u2019s good for me.  \n\nBut if we both move into (1, 3) same turn, that\u2019s head-on collision (both heads into same cell) \u2192 both die. So I must avoid arriving same turn as enemy.  \n\nIf enemy is at (1, 1) now, they can be at (1, 2) next turn, then (1, 3) the turn after.  \nIf I go LEFT to (1, 4) now, I can be at (1, 3) next turn. That means I arrive one turn before enemy could. Safe.  \n\nIf enemy is at (0, 0) now, they can\u2019t reach (1, 3) before me if I go LEFT now.  \n\nSo LEFT seems safe regarding apple (1, 3).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT gets me to (1, 4), next turn DOWN to (1, 3) apple before enemy can head-on collide.  \nDOWN to (2, 3) also lets me get (1, 3) next turn, but from (2, 3) I\u2019m closer to enemy if they go UP now.  \n\nLEFT also moves toward (0, 1) apple afterward.  \n\nGiven enemy length advantage, I should grab nearest apple safely. LEFT \u2192 DOWN next turn seems safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 4), if enemy is at (1, 1), go DOWN to (1, 3) to eat apple before enemy can arrive. If enemy is at (0, 0), still go DOWN to eat apple. After eating, consider path to (0, 1) or (7, 2) while avoiding enemy.  \n\nLEFT",

Enemy could go UP to (1, 2) this turn, then next turn enemy could move to (1, 3) but I\u2019ll already have eaten it and grown, and my body will be at (1, 3) next turn? Wait:  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (1, 3) now:  \n- I eat apple, grow to length 5.  \n- My new body: head (1, 3), then old head (1, 4), then (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6).  \n- Next turn, my body occupies (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6).  \n\nEnemy at (1, 1) could go UP to (1, 2) this turn. Then next turn, enemy could go DOWN to (1, 1) or UP to (1, 3) or LEFT to (0, 2) or RIGHT to (2, 2).  \nIf enemy goes UP to (1, 3) next turn, they would hit my body at (1, 3) (since I\u2019m there from previous turn) and die. That\u2019s good for me.  \n\nSo DOWN seems safe and beneficial: eat apple, possibly cause enemy to suicide into me next turn if they chase.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future move flexibility after each safe move:**  \n\n**DOWN to (1, 3):**  \nNext turn body: head (1, 3), then (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6).  \nFrom (1, 3):  \nUP (1, 4) \u2192 my body (dead).  \nDOWN (1, 2) \u2192 empty (but enemy could be there next turn if they go UP now).  \nLEFT (0, 3) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT (2, 3) \u2192 empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, unless enemy occupies (1, 2) next turn (then DOWN is unsafe).  \n\n**LEFT to (0, 4):**  \nNext turn body: head (0, 4), then (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6).  \nFrom (0, 4):  \nUP (0, 5) \u2192 empty.  \nDOWN (0, 3) \u2192 empty.  \nLEFT off board (dead).  \nRIGHT (1, 4) \u2192 my body (dead).  \nSo only 2 safe moves: UP, DOWN. Less flexible.  \n\n**UP to (1, 5):**  \nNext turn body: head (1, 5), then (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6).  \nFrom (1, 5):  \nUP (1, 6) \u2192 empty.  \nDOWN (1, 4) \u2192 my body (dead).  \nLEFT (0, 5) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT (2, 5) \u2192 my body (dead).  \nSo 2 safe moves: UP, LEFT. Less flexible.  \n\nThus DOWN gives best future flexibility (3 moves) and eats apple now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk of enemy cutting me off:**  \nEnemy could go UP to (1, 2) this turn, blocking my DOWN move next turn from (1, 3), but that\u2019s fine \u2014 I can go LEFT or RIGHT next turn.  \n\nAlso, if enemy goes UP to (1, 2), they are closer to (0, 1) apple, but I\u2019m not targeting that immediately.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN eats apple, grows, keeps options open, and may set up enemy to run into my body next turn if they chase.  \nLEFT or UP don\u2019t eat apple now and reduce future moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 3), if enemy is at (1, 2), avoid DOWN (head-on risk). Go LEFT toward (0, 1) apple or RIGHT toward center. If enemy not at (1, 2), DOWN to (1, 2) is safe and moves toward (0, 1) or (7, 2).

That\u2019s a possible head-on next turn if I stay.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 3), I\u2019m moving away from most apples but into empty space.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 3), I move toward center and closer to (2, 7) vertically.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future move flexibility after each safe move:**  \n\n**DOWN to (1, 2):**  \nNext turn body: head (1, 2), then (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6).  \nFrom (1, 2):  \nUP (1, 3) \u2192 my body (dead).  \nDOWN (1, 1) \u2192 enemy body (dead).  \nLEFT (0, 2) \u2192 possibly enemy there next turn if enemy goes UP now.  \nRIGHT (2, 2) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo depending on enemy move, only RIGHT might be safe, maybe LEFT if enemy not there. Risky.  \n\n**LEFT to (0, 3):**  \nNext turn body: head (0, 3), then (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6).  \nFrom (0, 3):  \nUP (0, 4) \u2192 empty.  \nDOWN (0, 2) \u2192 possibly enemy there next turn if enemy goes UP now.  \nLEFT off board (dead).  \nRIGHT (1, 3) \u2192 my body (dead).  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, maybe DOWN if enemy not there.  \n\n**RIGHT to (2, 3):**  \nNext turn body: head (2, 3), then (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6).  \nFrom (2, 3):  \nUP (2, 4) \u2192 my body (dead).  \nDOWN (2, 2) \u2192 empty.  \nLEFT (1, 3) \u2192 my body (dead).  \nRIGHT (3, 3) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nRIGHT seems safest for next-turn options regardless of enemy move.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is longer (8 vs my 5), so avoid head-on. Move toward apples (2, 7) or (7, 2) while keeping space. RIGHT now opens path to go UP later toward (2, 7) or DOWN toward (7, 2).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT is safe now, gives two safe moves next turn, moves toward center and apples. Avoid DOWN because next turn could be trapped if enemy goes UP. Avoid LEFT because fewer options.  \n\nRIGHT  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 3), consider DOWN to (2, 2) or RIGHT to (3, 3) depending on apple positions and enemy location. Aim to approach (2, 7) via (2, 3) \u2192 (2, 4) not possible (body), so maybe go RIGHT then UP later.  \n\nRIGHT",

Need to catch up but stay safe.  \nAvoid top row trap. Move toward center to keep options open.  \n(6, 5) is a good target.

Need to catch up safely.  \nAvoid trapping myself: UP is dangerous next turn.  \nDOWN seems best \u2014 moves toward apple (6, 5) while keeping options open.  \nCheck if (6, 7) is safe from enemy\u2019s possible moves next turn:  \nEnemy at (2, 1) could move DOWN to (2, 0), LEFT to (1, 1), RIGHT to (3, 1).  \nNone threaten (6, 7) next turn.  \n\nAlso, from (6, 7) I can go DOWN to (6, 6) next turn, then to (6, 5) if apple still there.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nGo DOWN now to (6, 7), then aim for (6, 5) apple while monitoring enemy movement.

Check body list: (4, 0) is in its body (second segment) \u2192 dead.  \n- RIGHT (6, 0): empty.  \n\nSo enemy can go UP or RIGHT.  \n\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (6, 0), no immediate collision with my possible moves.  \nIf enemy goes UP to (5, 1), also safe for now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \nMy possible moves: (5, 6), (5, 4), (4, 5).  \nEnemy possible moves: (5, 1), (6, 0).  \nNo overlap \u2192 no head-on collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Next-turn safety after each safe move:**  \n\n**UP to (5, 6):**  \nNew body: head (5, 6), then (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8) \u2014 length 9 (no growth).  \nFrom (5, 6):  \n- UP (5, 7): empty.  \n- DOWN (5, 5): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- LEFT (4, 6): empty.  \n- RIGHT (6, 6): my body \u2192 dead.  \nSafe next moves: UP, LEFT (2 options).  \n\n**DOWN to (5, 4):**  \nBody: head (5, 4), then (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8).  \nFrom (5, 4):  \n- UP (5, 5): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- DOWN (5, 3): empty.  \n- LEFT (4, 4): empty.  \n- RIGHT (6, 4): empty.  \nSafe next moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n**LEFT to (4, 5):**  \nBody: head (4, 5), then (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8).  \nFrom (4, 5):  \n- UP (4, 6): empty.  \n- DOWN (4, 4): empty.  \n- LEFT (3, 5): empty.  \n- RIGHT (5, 5): my body \u2192 dead.  \nSafe next moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).  \n\nSo UP gives only 2 safe next moves, DOWN and LEFT give 3 each.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (6, 9) \u2013 4 steps away, but blocked by my body at (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9) in that area.  \n- (2, 8) \u2013 5 steps from (5, 5).  \n- (9, 9) \u2013 far.  \n- (9, 1) \u2013 far.  \n- (9, 0) \u2013 far.  \n\nFrom (5, 4) or (4, 5), I\u2019m not much closer to any apple immediately.  \nBut (4, 5) is closer to (2, 8) than (5, 4) is.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is longer (12 vs 9). I need to eat apples but safely.  \nUP reduces future options (only 2 safe moves next turn), so avoid unless necessary.  \nBetween DOWN and LEFT:  \n- DOWN (5, 4) keeps me central, can go toward bottom apples (9, 1) or (9, 0) later.  \n- LEFT (4, 5) moves toward left side, can go toward (2, 8) apple.  \n\n(2, 8) is closer in steps than (9, 1) from my current position.  \nAlso, enemy is at bottom left area (5, 0), so going LEFT might bring me closer to enemy\u2019s possible path if it goes UP, but not immediately dangerous.  \n\nI think LEFT is slightly better because:  \n1. Same safe next-move count as DOWN.  \n2. Moves toward apple (2, 8) which is not near enemy\u2019s current location.  \n3. Avoids moving toward bottom row where enemy might roam.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 5), next turn I can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT. If I go LEFT again to (3, 5), I\u2019ll be closer to (2, 8). Need to check enemy\u2019s possible future positions to avoid head-on later.  \n\nLEFT",

That\u2019s a clear path.  \n\nUP from (3, 5) to (3, 6) also allows approach to (2, 8) via (3, 7) \u2192 (2, 7) \u2192 (2, 8) but that\u2019s longer and my body at (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9) blocks some area but not my path.  \n\nGiven enemy is far, maximizing safe moves is wise. UP gives more options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gives more future flexibility and still allows me to reach (2, 8) in a few turns.  \nLEFT reduces future options slightly.  \nI\u2019ll choose UP.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 6), consider moving toward (2, 8) via LEFT or UP, but check enemy\u2019s new position first.

If I eat it, I grow to length 11 next turn (tail stays same this turn, growth after move). But for next-turn safety check, assume I eat apple: new body length 11, tail at (6, 8) stays until next move, so next turn my body occupies current body minus tail? Wait, careful:  \nActually, growth means after moving to (2, 8) and eating apple, my body becomes: head (2, 8), then (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8) \u2014 length 11.

Risky.  \n\n**LEFT to (1, 6):**  \nBody: head (1, 6), then (2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8).  \nFrom (1, 6):  \n- UP (1, 7): empty.  \n- DOWN (1, 5): empty.  \n- LEFT (0, 6): empty.  \n- RIGHT (2, 6): my body \u2192 dead.  \nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).  \n\nSo UP and LEFT give 3 safe next moves, DOWN gives 1 \u2192 eliminate DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nFrom (2, 6):  \n- (2, 8): distance 2 steps (UP then UP).  \n- (4, 9): distance |2-4| + |6-9| = 2 + 3 = 5 steps.  \n- (6, 9): distance 4 + 3 = 7 steps.  \n- (9, 9): far.  \n- (9, 1): far.  \n\nUP gets me closer to (2, 8). LEFT to (1, 6) is neutral to (2, 8) (still 2 steps away via UP then RIGHT? Actually from (1, 6) to (2, 8): |1-2| + |6-8| = 1 + 2 = 3 steps, worse).  \n\nSo UP is best for nearest apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy future threat:**  \nEnemy will be at (9, 1) after this turn, length 15. Far from me. I can safely go for (2, 8) apple next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nGo UP now to (2, 7), then UP to (2, 8) to eat apple next turn. That gives me growth and keeps options open. LEFT is safe but delays apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP toward (2, 8) apple is best \u2014 safe now, good next-turn options, progress toward apple.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 7), move UP to (2, 8) to eat apple unless something unexpected happens (enemy far away).

If enemy goes LEFT, (8, 7) becomes enemy head this turn, then next turn it\u2019s enemy body. So from (7, 7) next turn, RIGHT to (8, 7) would be into enemy body \u2192 dead.  \nThus safe next moves from (7, 7) depend on enemy\u2019s move:  \nIf enemy goes UP: safe next moves = DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \nIf enemy goes LEFT: safe next moves = DOWN, LEFT (2 options).  \n\n**RIGHT to (8, 8) \u2013 no apple:**  \nNew body: head (8, 8), then (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 6) \u2014 tail (3, 5) removed.  \nFrom (8, 8):  \n- UP (8, 9): empty.  \n- DOWN (8, 7): possible enemy move this turn to (8, 7) \u2014 if enemy goes LEFT from (9, 7), that\u2019s enemy head this turn, so next turn (8, 7) is enemy body \u2192 dead.  \n- LEFT (7, 8): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- RIGHT (9, 8): possible enemy move this turn to (9, 8) \u2014 if enemy goes UP from (9, 7), that\u2019s enemy head this turn, so next turn (9, 8) is enemy body \u2192 dead.  \nSo next turn from (8, 8):  \nIf enemy goes UP: safe moves = UP, DOWN (RIGHT into (9, 8) is enemy body).  \nIf enemy goes LEFT: safe moves = UP, RIGHT (DOWN into (8, 7) is enemy body).  \nEither way, 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity and enemy threat:**  \nFrom (7, 8):  \n- (6, 9) apple: 2 steps (UP then LEFT from (7, 9)).  \n- (4, 9) apple: farther.  \n- (9, 9) apple: 2 steps (UP then RIGHT from (7, 9) or RIGHT then UP from (8, 8)).  \n- (4, 2) apple: far.  \n- (0, 5) apple: far.  \n\nEnemy at (9, 7) could go UP to (9, 8) or LEFT to (8, 7).  \nIf enemy goes UP to (9, 8), it\u2019s closer to (9, 9) apple.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (8, 7), it\u2019s moving toward center.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP to (7, 9) gives only 2 safe moves next turn and traps me along top row, but puts me closer to apples (6, 9) and (9, 9).  \nDOWN to (7, 7) risks enemy moving to (8, 7) and reducing my next-turn options, and moves away from most apples.  \nRIGHT to (8, 8) also gives 2 safe moves next turn but keeps me central and closer to (9, 9) if enemy doesn\u2019t take it.  \n\nGiven enemy is longer, I need apples but must avoid being trapped.  \nUP seems most direct toward apples, but top row is risky.  \nHowever, from (7, 9) next turn, I can go LEFT to (6, 9) to eat apple, then possibly DOWN to (6, 8) (but that\u2019s my old body \u2014 wait, next turn after UP, my body will be: (7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 8), \u2026 so (6, 8) is body, so from (7, 9) going LEFT to (6, 9) eats apple, then next turn from (6, 9) only LEFT/RIGHT safe, DOWN is body. That\u2019s still risky.  \n\nMaybe RIGHT to (8, 8) is safer for flexibility, but enemy might take (9, 9) apple if it goes UP.  \n\nLet\u2019s check: If enemy goes UP to (9, 8), it\u2019s adjacent to (9, 9) apple and will likely eat it next turn.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 8), I\u2019m closer to (9, 9) but enemy could still get it first if it goes UP then RIGHT.  \n\nActually, if enemy goes UP to (9, 8), then next turn it can go RIGHT to (9, 9) and eat it.  \nIf I go UP to (7, 9), then next turn I can go RIGHT to (8, 9), then next turn UP to (8, 10) invalid, so I\u2019d need to go RIGHT to (9, 9) on turn after next, but enemy would get it before me.  \n\nSo (9, 9) apple is likely going to enemy if it goes UP.  \n\nThus maybe better to aim for (6, 9) apple:  \nFrom (7, 8), UP to (7, 9), then LEFT to (6, 9) eats apple, then I have to deal with being on (6, 9) with limited moves.  \n\nGiven enemy length advantage, I need to collect apples but avoid risky traps.  \nRIGHT seems slightly safer in terms of keeping options, but UP gets me closer to an apple path.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose **UP** to move toward apples and reassess next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 9), if enemy is at (9, 8), avoid moving toward it. Likely go LEFT to (6, 9) to eat apple if safe, else RIGHT to (8, 9) to stay flexible.  \n\nUP",

That\u2019s a dead-end path (only 1 safe move next turn).  \n\n**RIGHT to (8, 9) \u2013 no apple:**  \nNew body: head (8, 9), then (7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6) \u2014 tail (3, 6) removed.  \n\nFrom (8, 9):  \n- UP (8, 10): off board \u2192 dead.  \n- DOWN (8, 8): possible enemy move this turn to (8, 8) \u2014 if enemy goes LEFT from (9, 8), that\u2019s enemy head this turn, so next turn (8, 8) is enemy body \u2192 dead.  \n- LEFT (7, 9): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- RIGHT (9, 9): possible enemy move this turn to (9, 9) \u2014 if enemy goes UP from (9, 8), that\u2019s enemy head this turn, so next turn (9, 9) is enemy body \u2192 dead.  \n\nSo next turn from (8, 9):  \nIf enemy goes UP: safe moves = none? UP off board, DOWN into enemy body (since (8, 8) is empty now but enemy at (9, 9) means (8, 8) is empty next turn? Wait, check: enemy at (9, 8) now. If enemy goes UP to (9, 9), then enemy body becomes: (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), \u2026 So (8, 8) is empty next turn. So DOWN to (8, 8) is safe. LEFT is my body, RIGHT is enemy body (9, 9). So safe moves = DOWN only.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT: enemy goes to (8, 8), then enemy body: (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), \u2026 So next turn (8, 8) is enemy body, (9, 9) is empty. So from (8, 9) next turn: DOWN into enemy body \u2192 dead, RIGHT to (9, 9) safe. So safe moves = RIGHT only.  \n\nSo either way, only 1 safe move next turn after RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Compare:**  \nLEFT \u2192 eat apple but only 1 safe move next turn (to (5, 9)), then from (5, 9) maybe more options.  \nRIGHT \u2192 no apple, only 1 safe move next turn, and that move depends on enemy\u2019s choice.  \n\nEating apple is important to catch up (enemy has 15 vs my 9). But being trapped after eating is dangerous.  \n\nFrom (5, 9) after LEFT this turn and LEFT next turn:  \n(5, 9) \u2192 moves: UP off board, DOWN (5, 8) is my body, LEFT (4, 9) is apple and empty, RIGHT (6, 9) is my body. So only LEFT to (4, 9) to eat another apple. That keeps me on top row eating apples but eventually trapped at left edge.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Consider enemy\u2019s likely move:**  \nEnemy at (9, 8) sees apple at (9, 9). Likely goes UP to eat it, growing to length 17. If so, then after my RIGHT move, next turn from (8, 9) only DOWN is safe (to (8, 8)), which is okay but then I\u2019m near enemy\u2019s long body along right edge.  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (8, 8), then apple (9, 9) remains, and after my RIGHT move, next turn from (8, 9) only RIGHT to (9, 9) is safe, eating apple then.  \n\nSo RIGHT could still get me an apple next turn if enemy doesn\u2019t take (9, 9) now.  \n\nLEFT gets me (6, 9) apple now for sure.  \n\nGiven enemy length advantage, I need apples quickly but must avoid dying next turn. Both options give only 1 safe move next turn, but LEFT at least gets an apple now and maybe sets up for (4, 9) apple after.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nI\u2019ll take the guaranteed apple now with LEFT, then try to navigate carefully along top row toward (4, 9) while watching enemy.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 9), go LEFT to (5, 9) (only safe move), then from (5, 9) go LEFT to (4, 9) to eat apple, extending length. After that, maybe DOWN from (4, 9) to (4, 8) if body has moved by then.  \n\nLEFT",

LEFT (7,7) moves me left toward the apple cluster around x=5..6 and opens routes (left or down from there). DOWN (8,6) also leads toward that cluster but keeps me closer to the right-wall body and reduces options on the right side.\n- Moving LEFT avoids the right-wall corridor where my body is currently crowded and preserves more flexible escape options (I can go left or down from 7,7).\n\nShort plan:\n- Head left toward the apples at (6,5) and (5,3), staying clear of the right-wall corridor and avoiding narrow traps.

Wait, check: body list: (7, 7), (8, 7), ... so (8, 6) is empty). Actually (8, 6) is empty.  \n\nSo enemy can go DOWN (7, 5), LEFT (6, 6), or RIGHT (8, 6).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Check for possible head-on collisions:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (1, 8), enemy heads can't reach (1, 8) from (7, 6) in one move \u2192 safe.  \nIf I go LEFT to (0, 9), enemy can't reach (0, 9) from (7, 6) in one move \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo both DOWN and LEFT are safe from immediate collision.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Next turn safety after each move:**  \n\n**Option A: DOWN to (1, 8)**  \nMy new body: head (1, 8), then (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), ..., (3, 8).  \nFrom (1, 8) next turn:  \n- UP (1, 9): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- DOWN (1, 7): empty.  \n- LEFT (0, 8): empty.  \n- RIGHT (2, 8): my body (currently at (2, 8)? Wait, after move, tail is at (3, 8), so (2, 8) is empty? Let's check: old body: (2, 9) becomes (1, 9), (3, 9) becomes (2, 9), ..., (3, 8) becomes (2, 8)? Actually careful:  \nCurrent body: (1, 9) head, then (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8).  \nMove DOWN: head to (1, 8), then rest shift: (1, 9), (2, 9), ..., (3, 8) becomes (2, 8) at tail.  \nSo next turn from (1, 8):  \nUP (1, 9) \u2192 body.  \nDOWN (1, 7) \u2192 empty.  \nLEFT (0, 8) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT (2, 8) \u2192 body (tail now at (2, 8)).  \nSo safe moves next turn: DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Option B: LEFT to (0, 9)**  \nMy new body: head (0, 9), then (1, 9), (2, 9), ..., (3, 8) becomes (2, 8) tail.  \nFrom (0, 9) next turn:  \n- UP off board \u2192 dead.  \n- DOWN (0, 8): empty.  \n- LEFT off board \u2192 dead.  \n- RIGHT (1, 9): body \u2192 dead.  \nSo only safe move next turn: DOWN to (0, 8). That's a dead-end next turn (only 1 safe move).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nApples: (0, 5), (4, 2), (6, 5), (5, 3), (1, 5).  \nFrom (1, 8): closer to (1, 5) and (0, 5) by going down later.  \nFrom (0, 9): only way is down toward (0, 5), but limited options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nEnemy is on right side, long, could block. I need to stay safe and keep options open.  \nLEFT to (0, 9) forces me into a corner with only one safe move next turn \u2014 risky if enemy approaches later.  \nDOWN to (1, 8) gives two safe moves next turn (DOWN or LEFT), more flexibility.  \n\nAlso, from (1, 8) I can go to (1, 7) next turn, then toward apples (1, 5) or (0, 5).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Conclusion:**  \nBoth DOWN and LEFT are safe this turn, but DOWN gives more future options.  \nI'll choose DOWN to keep flexibility and move toward apples.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \n1. This turn: DOWN to (1, 8).  \n2. Next turn: likely DOWN to (1, 7) unless enemy blocks, then maybe LEFT to (0, 8).  \n3. Then work down toward (1, 5) or (0, 5).  \n\nDOWN",

DOWN (to 7,5) also keeps multiple follow-up choices: LEFT to take (6,5), DOWN to continue toward the (5,3)/(4,2) cluster, or RIGHT to (8,5).\n- Enemy head (#0) is far (1,9) and cannot reach or threaten these local moves this turn.\n\nDecision and short plan:\n- Choose DOWN to (7,5).

Good flexibility.  \n\n**Option B: LEFT to (0, 7)**  \nNew body: head (0, 7), then (1, 7), (1, 8), \u2026, (5, 8) becomes (4, 8) tail.  \nFrom (0, 7) next turn:  \n- UP (0, 8): empty.  \n- DOWN (0, 6): empty.  \n- LEFT off board \u2192 dead.  \n- RIGHT (1, 7): my body \u2192 dead.  \nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN (2 options). Edge limits.  \n\n**Option C: RIGHT to (2, 7)**  \nNew body: head (2, 7), then (1, 7), (1, 8), \u2026, (5, 8) becomes (4, 8) tail.  \nFrom (2, 7) next turn:  \n- UP (2, 8): my body? Tail is at (4, 8) after this move, but (2, 8) is not in body (check: body after move: (2,7), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8) \u2014 yes (2,8) is not in list). Wait, careful: (2,8) is not in that list, so UP is safe.  \n- DOWN (2, 6): empty.  \n- LEFT (1, 7): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- RIGHT (3, 7): empty.  \nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nSo both DOWN and RIGHT give 3 safe moves next turn, LEFT gives 2.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nApples: (0, 5), (4, 2), (5, 3), (1, 5), (4, 3).  \n\nFrom (1, 6): closest apple is (1, 5) directly below.  \nFrom (0, 7): closest apple is (0, 5) two steps down.  \nFrom (2, 7): closest apple is (4, 3) or (5, 3) to the right/down.  \n\n(1, 5) is reachable in 1 turn if I go DOWN now and DOWN next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy threat path:**  \nEnemy at (6, 5) could move toward apples at (4, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3) via LEFT then DOWN.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 7), I might move into central area where enemy could approach.  \nIf I go DOWN to (1, 6), I stay left side away from enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN to (1, 6) gives 3 safe moves next turn, moves toward apple (1, 5), and keeps distance from enemy.  \nRIGHT to (2, 7) also gives 3 safe moves but moves closer to enemy territory.  \nLEFT to (0, 7) reduces options.  \n\nBest choice: **DOWN**.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \n1. This turn: DOWN to (1, 6).  \n2. Next turn: if safe, DOWN to (1, 5) to eat apple, then plan route to (0, 5) or (4, 2) while avoiding enemy.  \n3. Keep checking enemy head movement to avoid head-on collisions.  \n\nDOWN",

Wait, apple at (0,5) still there unless enemy eats it this turn. But cell empty of bodies.  \n- RIGHT (2, 5): empty.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n**Option B: LEFT to (0, 6)**  \nBody after move: head (0,6), then (1,6), (1,7), \u2026, (6,8) tail.  \n\nFrom (0, 6) next turn:  \n- UP (0, 7): empty.  \n- DOWN (0, 5): apple, empty.  \n- LEFT off board \u2192 dead.  \n- RIGHT (1, 6): my body \u2192 dead.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN (2 options).  \n\n**Option C: RIGHT to (2, 6)**  \nBody after move: head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,7), \u2026, (6,8) tail.  \n\nFrom (2, 6) next turn:  \n- UP (2, 7): empty.  \n- DOWN (2, 5): empty.  \n- LEFT (1, 6): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- RIGHT (3, 6): empty.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity and enemy path:**  \nApples: (0,5), (4,2), (5,3), (1,5), (4,3).  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (1,5), I eat apple immediately, gain length, and next turn I can go LEFT to (0,5) for another apple.  \n\nEnemy at (6,4) is far from (0,5) and (1,5) this turn, but could move toward (4,2), (5,3), (4,3).  \n\nEating apples quickly is important because enemy has 17 vs my 11.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nIf I eat (1,5) now and (0,5) next turn, I\u2019ll be at 13 apples, still behind but catching up.  \nThen I can consider moving toward bottom-left area (safe from enemy) or toward (4,2) etc.  \n\nRIGHT to (2,6) doesn\u2019t get apple now, but gives flexibility.  \nLEFT to (0,6) reduces options.  \n\nBest is DOWN: eat apple, keep 3 safe moves next turn, sets up double apple in two turns.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \n1. This turn: DOWN to (1,5) to eat apple.  \n2. Next turn: if safe, LEFT to (0,5) to eat second apple.  \n3. After that, consider path to (4,2) via (0,4) \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 \u2026 but watch enemy movement.  \n4. Enemy is long, might block center-right, so stick to left side for safety while collecting apples.  \n\nDOWN",

Wait, I ate apple last turn, so tail didn\u2019t move last turn. Now no apple this turn, so tail moves: tail is (6,8) \u2192 previous segment (7,8) becomes new tail? Actually, body after last move:  \nHead (1,5), then (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (7,8), (6,8) tail.  \nIf I move DOWN to (1,4) without eating apple, tail (6,8) is removed, new tail is (7,8).  \n\nFrom (1, 4) next turn:  \n- UP (1, 5): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- DOWN (1, 3): empty.  \n- LEFT (0, 4): empty.  \n- RIGHT (2, 4): empty.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n**Option B: LEFT to (0, 5)** (eat apple)  \nBody after move: head (0,5), then (1,5), (1,6), \u2026, (6,8) tail stays (no tail move because apple eaten).  \n\nFrom (0, 5) next turn:  \n- UP (0, 6): empty.  \n- DOWN (0, 4): empty.  \n- LEFT off board \u2192 dead.  \n- RIGHT (1, 5): my body \u2192 dead.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN (2 options).  \n\n**Option C: RIGHT to (2, 5)** (no apple)  \nBody after move: head (2,5), then (1,5), (1,6), \u2026, (6,8) tail removed, new tail (7,8).  \n\nFrom (2, 5) next turn:  \n- UP (2, 6): empty.  \n- DOWN (2, 4): empty.  \n- LEFT (1, 5): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- RIGHT (3, 5): empty.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity and enemy path:**  \nApples: (0,5), (4,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,4).  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,5), I eat apple immediately (13 \u2192 14 apples). But then next turn only 2 safe moves.  \nEnemy is at (5,4) and could move toward (3,4), (4,3), (5,3) apples.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (1,4), no apple now, but I can go to (0,4) next turn, then (0,3), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) to get apple at (4,2) in several moves.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,5), no apple, but maybe toward (3,4) apple later.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nEnemy is long (length 18) and occupies right side heavily. I should avoid moving into right side where I could get trapped.  \nLEFT to eat apple now reduces options next turn, but I\u2019ll be at 14 apples vs enemy 17.  \nDOWN keeps more options open and avoids boxing myself in left column.  \n\nActually, if I go LEFT to (0,5), next turn only UP or DOWN. UP to (0,6) then next turn only UP/DOWN again (left off board, right into body). That\u2019s risky \u2014 could get stuck in left column with enemy approaching.  \n\nBetter to go DOWN to (1,4) \u2014 stay flexible, keep 3 moves next turn, and approach apple (4,2) safely from left side.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \n1. This turn: DOWN to (1,4) to keep options open.  \n2. Next turn: likely LEFT to (0,4) to move toward bottom-left area, then work toward (4,2) apple via safe path.  \n3. Avoid right side where enemy is long and can block.  \n4. Monitor enemy movement toward apples (3,4), (4,3), (5,3) \u2014 maybe enemy will go for those, giving me time to collect (0,5) later if still there.  \n\nDOWN",

Wait, my body list:  \nCurrent: (1,4) head, then (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (7,8) tail.  \nIf I move DOWN to (1,3) without eating apple, tail (7,8) is removed, new tail is (7,9).  \n\nFrom (1, 3) next turn:  \n- UP (1, 4): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- DOWN (1, 2): empty.  \n- LEFT (0, 3): empty.  \n- RIGHT (2, 3): empty.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n**Option B: LEFT to (0, 4)** (no apple)  \nBody after move: head (0,4), then (1,4), (1,5), \u2026, (7,8) tail removed, new tail (7,9).  \n\nFrom (0, 4) next turn:  \n- UP (0, 5): apple, empty.  \n- DOWN (0, 3): empty.  \n- LEFT off board \u2192 dead.  \n- RIGHT (1, 4): my body \u2192 dead.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN (2 options).  \n\n**Option C: RIGHT to (2, 4)** (no apple)  \nBody after move: head (2,4), then (1,4), (1,5), \u2026, (7,8) tail removed, new tail (7,9).  \n\nFrom (2, 4) next turn:  \n- UP (2, 5): empty.  \n- DOWN (2, 3): empty.  \n- LEFT (1, 4): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- RIGHT (3, 4): apple, empty.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity and enemy path:**  \nApples: (0,5), (4,2), (4,3), (3,4), (0,9).  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,4), next turn I can go UP to (0,5) to eat apple, but then I\u2019d be at (0,5) with only UP/DOWN moves again (risky).  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (1,3), I move away from immediate apples but keep flexibility.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,4), next turn I can go RIGHT to (3,4) to eat apple, but that\u2019s close to enemy head at (5,3) \u2014 risky if enemy moves toward (4,3) or (3,4) this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy at (5,3) has apples at (4,3) LEFT and (3,4) UP-LEFT. It will likely go LEFT to (4,3) to eat apple, growing to length 20. That puts enemy head at (4,3) next turn.  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (4,3), then:  \n- My move RIGHT to (2,4) \u2192 next turn RIGHT to (3,4) apple would put me at (3,4) with enemy possibly at (4,3) \u2014 adjacent horizontally, risk head-on if enemy goes LEFT to (3,4) same turn. That\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (5,2) or RIGHT to (6,3), less risk. But likely it will take the apple at (4,3).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nI\u2019m shorter (13 vs 19). Need to collect apples while avoiding enemy.  \nThe apple at (0,5) is safe from enemy for now, but to get it I need to go LEFT now to (0,4), then UP to (0,5) next turn \u2014 that traps me in left column with only 2 moves after eating.  \n\nBetter to go DOWN to (1,3) to stay flexible, then work toward bottom-left apples later.  \nApple at (4,2) is reachable via (1,3) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (4,2) possibly, but enemy might go for (4,3) then (4,2) after.  \n\nActually, enemy will likely eat (4,3) this turn, then maybe (3,4) or (4,2) next. I should avoid that area.  \n\nApple at (0,9) is far and blocked by my body at top-left \u2014 unreachable soon.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT (0,4) gives a path to apple (0,5) next turn but reduces options.  \nRIGHT (2,4) risks head-on if enemy moves toward (3,4).  \nDOWN (1,3) is safest, keeps 3 options next turn, avoids enemy area.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose DOWN to stay safe and flexible.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \n1. This turn: DOWN to (1,3).  \n2. Next turn: likely LEFT to (0,3) to move toward bottom-left, then (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) for apple if still there.  \n3. Avoid right side where enemy is long.  \n4. Monitor enemy movement \u2014 if enemy eats (4,3) and (3,4), it may move away, giving chance to collect (0,5) later.  \n\nDOWN",

Yes, apple list now doesn't have (4,3), so enemy likely ate it.  \n\n**Enemy snake #1:**  \nHead: (4, 3)  \nBody: [(5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1)]  \nLength = 20 (19 apples + 1 initial).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Immediate safety from (1, 3):**  \n- UP (1, 4): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- DOWN (1, 2): empty.  \n- LEFT (0, 3): empty.  \n- RIGHT (2, 3): empty.  \n\nCheck enemy body: none of (1,2), (0,3), (2,3) are in enemy body.  \nAll three DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe from immediate collision with bodies.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \nEnemy head at (4, 3) can move:  \n- UP (4, 4): empty.  \n- DOWN (4, 2): apple, empty.  \n- LEFT (3, 3): empty.  \n- RIGHT (5, 3): its body \u2192 dead.  \n\nSo enemy can go UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\nMy possible moves:  \n- DOWN to (1, 2): enemy can\u2019t reach (1, 2) in one move \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT to (0, 3): enemy can\u2019t reach (0, 3) in one move \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT to (2, 3): enemy can\u2019t reach (2, 3) in one move \u2192 safe.  \n\nNo immediate head-on risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Next turn safety after each move:**  \n\n**Option A: DOWN to (1, 2)** (no apple)  \nBody after move: head (1,2), then (1,3), (1,4), \u2026, (7,9) tail removed, new tail (6,9).  \n\nFrom (1, 2) next turn:  \n- UP (1, 3): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- DOWN (1, 1): empty.  \n- LEFT (0, 2): empty.  \n- RIGHT (2, 2): empty.  \n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n**Option B: LEFT to (0, 3)** (no apple)  \nBody after move: head (0,3), then (1,3), (1,4), \u2026, (7,9) tail removed, new tail (6,9).  \n\nFrom (0, 3) next turn:  \n- UP (0, 4): empty.  \n- DOWN (0, 2): empty.  \n- LEFT off board \u2192 dead.  \n- RIGHT (1, 3): my body \u2192 dead.  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN (2 options).  \n\n**Option C: RIGHT to (2, 3)** (no apple)  \nBody after move: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,4), \u2026, (7,9) tail removed, new tail (6,9).  \n\nFrom (2, 3) next turn:  \n- UP (2, 4): empty.  \n- DOWN (2, 2): empty.  \n- LEFT (1, 3): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- RIGHT (3, 3): empty.  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity and enemy path:**  \nApples: (0,5), (4,2), (3,4), (0,9), (3,2).  \n\nEnemy at (4,3) is adjacent to apple (4,2) DOWN and apple (3,4) UP-LEFT.  \nEnemy will likely go DOWN to (4,2) to eat apple, growing to length 21.  \n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (4,2), then next turn enemy head at (4,2).  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,3), I could later move toward (3,2) apple, but that\u2019s close to enemy\u2019s new position (4,2) \u2014 risky.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,3), I can go UP to (0,4) then (0,5) apple, but that\u2019s a long path and enemy is far.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (1,2), I can go LEFT to (0,2) then UP to (0,3) etc., staying far from enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is long (20) and will likely dominate center-right. I should avoid its area.  \nApple (0,5) is safest for me \u2014 need to reach it without trapping myself.  \nFrom (1,3), going LEFT to (0,3) then UP to (0,4) then UP to (0,5) works, but after eating (0,5) I\u2019d be at (0,5) with only UP/DOWN moves \u2014 risky.  \n\nBetter: go DOWN to (1,2), then LEFT to (0,2), then UP to (0,3), then UP to (0,4), then UP to (0,5) \u2014 this keeps me near left wall but gives more options before eating apple.  \n\nApple (0,9) is blocked by my body at top-left \u2014 unreachable soon.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT (0,3) reduces options next turn to 2.  \nRIGHT (2,3) risks moving toward enemy area.  \nDOWN (1,2) keeps 3 options, moves away from enemy, and allows me to work toward left side apples safely.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose DOWN to stay safe and flexible.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \n1. This turn: DOWN to (1,2).  \n2. Next turn: likely LEFT to (0,2) to move toward bottom-left.  \n3. Then work up left column to (0,5) apple if still there.  \n4. Avoid right side entirely while enemy is so long.  \n\nDOWN",

No, (2,4) is up 2, left 1 \u2014 not adjacent. Adjacent empty cells: UP (3,3), DOWN (3,1), LEFT (2,2). Apple (3,4) is up 2 from (3,2). Apple (7,2) far right.  \n\nEnemy might go UP toward (3,4) or LEFT toward (2,4) area.  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (2,2), then next turn enemy head at (2,2).  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1), I\u2019d be adjacent to enemy\u2019s possible head at (2,2) next turn \u2014 dangerous for head-on collision risk.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (1,0) or LEFT to (0,1), I\u2019m farther from enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nFrom last turn\u2019s plan: I wanted to go DOWN then LEFT to work toward (0,5) apple.  \nNow at (1,1), going DOWN to (1,0) reduces next turn options to 2, but keeps me safe from enemy.  \nGoing LEFT to (0,1) also reduces options to 2.  \nGoing RIGHT to (2,1) gives 3 options next turn but puts me closer to enemy\u2019s likely path toward apples (2,4) or (3,4).  \n\nGiven enemy is very long (22) and I\u2019m only 13, I should avoid confrontation and work toward apples on left side: (0,5) and eventually (0,9).  \n\nLEFT to (0,1) sets me up to go UP to (0,2) next, then (0,3), etc., toward (0,5).  \nDOWN to (1,0) would require going LEFT to (0,0) then UP to (0,1) \u2014 slower.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT (2,1) is riskier due to enemy proximity.  \nDOWN (1,0) reduces options and delays apple pursuit.  \nLEFT (0,1) keeps me on left edge, moving toward (0,5) apple with reasonable safety.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose LEFT.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \n1. This turn: LEFT to (0,1).  \n2. Next turn: UP to (0,2) if safe (check enemy head position).  \n3. Then continue up left column toward (0,5) apple.  \n4. Avoid moving right toward enemy while it\u2019s so long.  \n\nLEFT",

Enemy likely goes UP to eat it (grows to length 23). If enemy goes UP, next turn its head at (3, 4).  \n\nIf I go UP to (0, 2), I\u2019m moving toward (0, 5) apple but only one move next turn (UP to (0, 3)). That\u2019s risky if enemy later cuts me off, but enemy is far for now.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 0), I\u2019m stuck with only RIGHT next turn, which goes toward enemy\u2019s territory and my own body line at (1, y).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nFrom last turn\u2019s plan, I wanted to go UP from (0, 1) toward (0, 5).  \nGoing UP now gives me a path up the left edge: (0, 2) \u2192 (0, 3) \u2192 (0, 4) \u2192 (0, 5) apple.  \nBut after UP to (0, 2), I only have UP next turn, so I must commit to going to (0, 3) next. That\u2019s okay because (0, 3) is safe unless enemy moves there in two turns \u2014 unlikely given enemy at (3, 3) now.  \n\nGoing DOWN to (0, 0) leads to dead-end with only RIGHT to (1, 0) next, then maybe up through (1, 0) \u2192 (1, 1) is body, so (2, 0) etc. That\u2019s messy and away from apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP gives a clear, safe path toward apple (0, 5) and keeps me on the edge away from enemy.  \nDOWN traps me with fewer options and delays apple pursuit.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose UP.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \n1. This turn: UP to (0, 2).  \n2. Next turn: UP to (0, 3) (only move).  \n3. Then UP to (0, 4), then (0, 5) apple.  \n4. After eating (0, 5), consider going right toward (2, 4) or up to (0, 9) if safe.  \n5. Avoid enemy\u2019s long body; it will be even longer after eating (3, 4) apple.  \n\nUP",

Let\u2019s trace:  \nCurrent tail (2, 9). After this UP move, tail becomes (1, 9). After next UP move to (0, 5), tail becomes (1, 8). So (1, 5) still occupied by my body segment that was at (1, 6) originally? Let\u2019s check:  \nBody after next move (UP to (0, 5)):  \nHead (0, 5), then (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9) \u2014 yes, (1, 5) is still occupied. So from (0, 5) only UP is safe unless enemy clears something.  \n\nSo I\u2019ll be stuck going up the left edge until I pass (0, 8) maybe. That\u2019s risky if enemy blocks top.  \n\nBut no choice now \u2014 must survive step by step.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \n1. This turn: UP to (0, 4).  \n2. Next turn: UP to (0, 5) apple.  \n3. Then UP to (0, 6) if safe.  \n4. Keep going up left edge until I can turn right at (0, 8) or (0, 9) if those cells free.  \n5. Avoid enemy head which is far right now but could move toward center.  \n\nUP",

Prioritize survival and options over a single apple; I have a sizeable lead.\n- Plan: move to (2,5) now, then prefer continuing north to (2,6) or go right to (3,5) to keep space.

That\u2019s risky because only one safe move after eating apple.  \n\n**If RIGHT to (1, 8):**  \nBody: head (1, 8), then (0, 8), (0, 7), ..., (1, 6) (tail stays same).  \nFrom (1, 8) next turn:  \n- UP (1, 9): empty.  \n- DOWN (1, 7): my body? Wait, (1, 7) is not in my body after moving? Let's check:  \nAfter moving to (1, 8), body: (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6).  \n(1, 7) is not in that list, so DOWN to (1, 7) is empty.  \n- LEFT (0, 8): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- RIGHT (2, 8): empty.  \n\nSo next turn from (1, 8) I\u2019d have UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe. That\u2019s much better for options.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is far away on right side, but I need to avoid getting trapped. Eating (0, 9) now leaves me only one safe move next turn, which could be dangerous if enemy moves toward (1, 9).  \nBetter to take RIGHT now to (1, 8), keeping flexibility, then maybe go to (1, 9) or (2, 8) next turn, possibly aiming for apples (2, 3) or (4, 4) later by moving across board.  \n\nAlso, enemy is longer, so I should avoid head-on risk in future turns. Staying flexible is key.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nMove RIGHT to (1, 8) now. Next turn from (1, 8), assess safety of UP (1, 9), DOWN (1, 7), RIGHT (2, 8). Likely go UP to (1, 9) to stay near top edge, then move right along top row toward center apples while avoiding enemy.  \n\nRIGHT",

To eat it I would have to enter from (4,5). When I move into the apple I would grow (tail wouldn\u2019t move), leaving me at (4,4) with only (4,5) as an adjacent free cell \u2014 but that cell would be my neck, so I would have no legal escape and would die next turn. In short: going DOWN twice to reach and eat (4,4) is effectively suicidal unless the board changes in a very unlikely way.\n\nDecision rationale:\n- Avoid moving into the trap toward (4,4).\n- RIGHT (5,7) keeps many immediate exits but pushes me toward a congested region formed by my own body on the right; it could reduce mobility in a few moves.\n- UP (4,8) keeps options open (multiple exits) and moves away from the boxed apple, preserving flexibility to circle and pursue safer apples (e.g., work toward (7,2)/(7,0) later or sweep the top) while the enemy remains isolated on the left.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns:\n- Keep space and avoid the (4,4) trap. From (4,8) evaluate whether to move right or up to access more open area; prioritize paths that keep at least two escape options and avoid entering tight enclosures created by my own body. If an apple appears or becomes safely reachable without trapping me, take it; otherwise preserve life and win by outlasting the opponent.\n\nUP",

Actually, (0, 9) is apple now, so empty. So LEFT (0, 9) is safe (apple).  \n- RIGHT (2, 9): empty.  \n\nSo from (1, 9), next turn safe moves: LEFT (to apple), RIGHT. Two safe moves.  \n\n**If DOWN to (1, 7):**  \nBody: head (1, 7), then (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7), \u2026, (1, 5).  \nFrom (1, 7) next turn:  \n- UP (1, 8): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- DOWN (1, 6): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- LEFT (0, 7): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- RIGHT (2, 7): empty.  \n\nOnly RIGHT safe. That\u2019s dangerous (only one safe move).  \n\n**If RIGHT to (2, 8):**  \nBody: head (2, 8), then (1, 8), (0, 8), \u2026, (1, 5).  \nFrom (2, 8) next turn:  \n- UP (2, 9): empty.  \n- DOWN (2, 7): empty.  \n- LEFT (1, 8): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- RIGHT (3, 8): empty.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Three safe moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \n- (0, 9) is close: from (1, 8), UP then LEFT next turn gets it.  \n- Others are far.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is at (4, 8), so top-right area is risky. Going DOWN to (1, 7) leaves only one safe move next turn \u2014 too risky.  \nUP to (1, 9) gives two safe moves next turn, one being apple (0, 9).  \nRIGHT to (2, 8) gives three safe moves next turn and moves toward center apples later.  \n\nBetter to keep flexibility: RIGHT gives most options and avoids trapping myself.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nMove RIGHT to (2, 8) now. Next turn from (2, 8), assess safety of UP (2, 9), DOWN (2, 7), RIGHT (3, 8). Likely go UP to (2, 9) to stay near top edge, then move toward (0, 9) apple if safe, or continue right toward center apples while monitoring enemy at (4, 8).  \n\nRIGHT",

The enemy is closer to that apple, so I may not secure it immediately, but moving left keeps options open and avoids moving deeper into my own body.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Continue along the top row to maintain maximum escape options.

This is risky because that enemy's neck is at (2,8) so they cannot move DOWN; they could move RIGHT into (3,9) and cause a dangerous head-on or swap.

RIGHT and UP are illegal. DOWN is the only clearly-safe option this turn.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move down into open space to avoid head-on conflict and preserve mobility. From there, head toward the central apples (e.g., (4,4) or (2,3)) while avoiding the congested right-hand area and the enemy's corridor along the left/top.

Let\u2019s check: enemy head at (3, 9) can move UP (3, 10) off board, DOWN (3, 8) empty, LEFT (2, 9) my head, RIGHT (4, 9) its body. So enemy\u2019s safe moves: DOWN (3, 8) only. So enemy cannot stay at (3, 9) because it would have to move. If I go RIGHT to (3, 9) and enemy goes DOWN to (3, 8), no collision. But if enemy goes LEFT to (2, 9) (which is my current head), that\u2019s a head-on collision on (2, 9) only if I stay? Wait, I\u2019m moving away from (2, 9). So enemy moving LEFT to (2, 9) would hit my old body segment (2, 8) maybe? Let\u2019s check carefully:  \n\nEnemy\u2019s possible moves from (3, 9):  \nUP off board \u2192 no.  \nDOWN (3, 8) \u2192 empty, safe.  \nLEFT (2, 9) \u2192 currently my head, but I\u2019m moving this turn. If I move LEFT to (1, 9), then (2, 9) becomes empty (since my head leaves, body still at (2, 8)). So enemy could move LEFT to (2, 9) safely if I\u2019m not there. That\u2019s fine, no collision with me.  \nRIGHT (4, 9) \u2192 its body \u2192 no.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only truly safe move is DOWN (3, 8). LEFT (2, 9) is safe only if I\u2019m not there, which I won\u2019t be if I move away. But enemy doesn\u2019t know my move; it might risk LEFT if it thinks (2, 9) empty. But (2, 9) is empty after I leave, so yes, LEFT is safe for enemy. So enemy has two safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.  \n\nNow, if I go RIGHT to (3, 9):  \n- Enemy going DOWN to (3, 8) \u2192 I go to (3, 9), enemy to (3, 8), no collision.  \n- Enemy going LEFT to (2, 9) \u2192 I go to (3, 9), enemy to (2, 9), no collision.  \nSo no head-on collision possible with enemy this turn if I go RIGHT.  \n\nBut wait, what about enemy\u2019s body? (3, 9) currently has enemy head, so moving into it while enemy head leaves is fine if enemy moves away. But if enemy stays (which it can\u2019t safely), then collision. Since enemy must move, and safe moves are DOWN or LEFT, enemy will leave (3, 9). So RIGHT to (3, 9) is safe from immediate death.  \n\nSo safe moves for me: LEFT (1, 9) and RIGHT (3, 9).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Next turn safety after each safe move:**  \n\n**If LEFT to (1, 9):**  \nBody: head (1, 9), then (2, 9), (2, 8), (1, 8), \u2026  \nFrom (1, 9) next turn:  \n- UP off board \u2192 dead.  \n- DOWN (1, 8): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- LEFT (0, 9): apple, empty.  \n- RIGHT (2, 9): my body (old head) \u2192 dead.  \n\nSo only LEFT is safe next turn. That\u2019s risky (only one safe move).  \n\n**If RIGHT to (3, 9):**  \nBody: head (3, 9), then (2, 9), (2, 8), (1, 8), \u2026  \nFrom (3, 9) next turn:  \n- UP off board \u2192 dead.  \n- DOWN (3, 8): currently empty (enemy might be there after its move this turn). Let\u2019s check: enemy\u2019s head this turn is at (3, 9), it moves DOWN to (3, 8) or LEFT to (2, 9). So if enemy goes DOWN, (3, 8) will have enemy head, so next turn DOWN from (3, 9) would be into enemy head? Wait, next turn enemy head will move again from (3, 8) or (2, 9). So (3, 8) might be empty or enemy body. Hard to predict. But if enemy went DOWN to (3, 8) this turn, then next turn enemy could move from (3, 8) to somewhere, possibly leaving (3, 8) empty or not. Too risky to assume safe. Let\u2019s instead check immediate next-turn safety ignoring enemy:  \nDOWN (3, 8): unknown (could be enemy head or empty).  \nLEFT (2, 9): my body \u2192 dead.  \nRIGHT (4, 9): enemy body \u2192 dead.  \n\nSo from (3, 9) next turn, only DOWN might be safe if enemy not there. That\u2019s also risky.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Compare both moves:**  \nLEFT (1, 9): only LEFT safe next turn (to (0, 9) apple).  \nRIGHT (3, 9): only DOWN possibly safe next turn, but enemy might be there.  \n\nLEFT at least leads to apple (0, 9) next turn, giving growth and possibly more space later.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \nAlready checked: none.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term:**  \nEnemy is longer, I need apples to catch up. (0, 9) is closest apple. Going LEFT now sets up to eat it next turn. Risk: after eating it, my body will have new segment at tail, so (0, 9) becomes body, but I\u2019ll be at (0, 9) next turn with only one exit? Let\u2019s simulate:  \n\nThis turn: LEFT to (1, 9).  \nNext turn: from (1, 9), only LEFT to (0, 9) safe (apple). Eat apple, grow. Body: head (0, 9), then (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), \u2026 tail grows by 1 at end.  \nFrom (0, 9) after eating:  \n- UP off board.  \n- DOWN (0, 8): my body \u2192 dead.  \n- LEFT off board.  \n- RIGHT (1, 9): my body \u2192 dead.  \n\nSo after eating (0, 9), I\u2019m trapped and die the turn after unless something changes (enemy dies, etc.). That\u2019s fatal.  \n\nSo eating (0, 9) is a death trap unless I can escape via some other cell opening up. But with current body layout, no.  \n\nThus LEFT is bad long-term.  \n\nRIGHT to (3, 9) might give more options: next turn from (3, 9), if DOWN (3, 8) is empty, I can go there and have more space in center.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Check DOWN (3, 8) status after this turn:**  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (3, 8) this turn, then I go RIGHT to (3, 9), enemy at (3, 8), next turn I can\u2019t go DOWN. But enemy might move from (3, 8) to somewhere, possibly (3, 7) (its body) or (2, 8) (my old body) or (4, 8) (its body). So enemy might have no safe move from (3, 8) and die. If enemy dies, I win.  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (2, 9) this turn, then (3, 8) empty, I go RIGHT to (3, 9), next turn DOWN to (3, 8) safe.  \n\nSo RIGHT seems better: chance enemy dies if it goes DOWN to (3, 8), or I get safe DOWN next turn if enemy goes LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan:**  \nGo RIGHT to (3, 9). Hope enemy goes LEFT to (2, 9) (safe for it) so I can go DOWN next turn. If enemy goes DOWN to (3, 8), it might be trapped next turn and die, giving me win.  \n\nRIGHT",
