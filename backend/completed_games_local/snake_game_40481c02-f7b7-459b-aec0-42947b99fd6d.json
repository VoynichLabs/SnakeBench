Then, look to loop around or wait for the tail to clear (7, 0) to head towards the eastern apples at (9, 6) or (6, 1).

I just ate an apple at this position (my score is 11, and the body length grew).\n    - My body: [(7, 1), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (4, 2)].\n    - Length: 12.\n    - Enemy Snake #0 head is at (8, 8).\n\n2.  **Evaluating Moves from (6, 1):**\n    - **UP:** (6, 2). **FATAL.** This is my own body.\n    - **RIGHT:** (7, 1). **FATAL.** This is my own neck (the previous head position).\n    - **DOWN:** (6, 0). Safe.\n    - **LEFT:** (5, 1). Safe.\n\n3.  **Strategic Choices between DOWN and LEFT:**\n    - **DOWN (6, 0):** Places me on the bottom edge. From (6, 0), I can go (7, 0) or (5, 0).\n    - **LEFT (5, 1):** Moves toward the left side of the board. The next available apple in that general direction is (0, 5) or (2, 4) or (1, 8).\n    - **Apple Locations:** (9, 6), (0, 5), (1, 8), (2, 4), (9, 2).\n    - (9, 2) is the closest apple (manhattan distance from (6, 1) is 3+1=4). To get there, I need to navigate around my body. \n    - My body occupies (7, 1) and (7, 2). I cannot move right immediately.\n    - If I move **DOWN** to (6, 0), I can then move RIGHT to (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0) and then UP to (9, 2). This path is relatively clear of my own tail.\n    - If I move **LEFT** to (5, 1), I am heading towards (2, 4) or (0, 5), but my body is currently coiled around (5, 2)-(3, 2), creating a bit of a barrier.\n\n4.  **Selection:**\n    Moving **DOWN** to (6, 0) is the cleanest way to begin circling around the bottom to reach the apple at (9, 2) without getting tangled in the mid-board coil.\n\n**Future Plan:**\nMove to (6, 0), then head right along the bottom edge (y=0) to reach x=9, then move up to collect the apple at (9, 2). This keeps me far away from the enemy and avoids my own body.\n\nDOWN",

They are 3 steps away from the apple at (9, 2) and also have apples nearby at (1, 8) and (2, 4). My body currently blocks them from coming directly down the 9th column (my tail is at 5, 4 and my body loops through the 6/7/8 columns).\n\n4.  **Strategic Plan:**\n    The immediate goal is to take the apple at (9, 2). After taking it, my head will be at (9, 2). I must then decide whether to continue UP (risky if Snake #0 moves into the 9th column) or move LEFT toward the cluster of apples at (1, 4), (2, 4), and (0, 5). Moving LEFT after taking the apple seems safer as it moves me away from the wall and toward more resources.\n\n**Plan for future turns:** Move UP to (9, 2) to collect the apple.

Prioritize LEFT\u2014maintains linear path on row 5 (next: (4,5) empty, then (3,5), (2,5) clear; tail follows without pinch). Positions for apple run without deviation. UP/DOWN viable but narrow future plays (UP crowds my upper body; DOWN rushes south, risking enemy intercept if they pursue apples like (5,1) or (1,4)).\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update\nProceed LEFT row5 west: t45 (5,5) safe. t46 LEFT (4,5) empty. t47 LEFT (3,5) open. t48 LEFT (2,5) clear. t49 DOWN (2,4) eat 9th apple (grow len9). t50 LEFT (1,4) eat 10th (len10). t51 RIGHT/UP to (0,4) or loop for (0,5) 11th. t52-55 secure col0 up to (0,8)-(1,8) for 12th (tie enemy). Monitor enemy len13+; evade bottom pursuits by staying mid-high (rows 4-6 cols 0-5 free-ish). Target (5,1) post-t60 if safe via south loop; aim 15+ apples by t80 through efficient NW/south sweeps, outgrow to win by t150.\n\nLEFT",

Snake #0 is currently competing for the cluster at (2, 4) and (1, 4); by the time you collect (5, 1), they will likely have moved further left, clearing the middle-left area for you to maneuver.

If it moves DOWN toward the same apple, we could encounter a head-on collision or it could block the column. However, it is currently 3 tiles above the apple at (0, 1), while I am 2 tiles away. I can reach (0, 1) in 2 turns. If Snake #0 moves DOWN three times, it hits (0, 1) on turn 3. \n    *   **Traps:** Moving to (0, 1) puts me against the wall. However, since my tail is moving out of the (8, 0) area and my body is mostly in the center-right, I have space to maneuver.\n\n4.  **Strategic Choice:**\n    *   Continue moving LEFT to collect (0, 1). This is the most immediate point and keeps me ahead in score. \n    *   If Snake #0 moves to (0, 3) or (1, 4) next turn, I will need to evaluate if I should commit to the corner or turn. For now, (1, 1) is safe.\n\n### Long-term Plan\nMove LEFT to (1, 1) and then (0, 1) to collect the apple. After collecting it, I will likely go UP toward (0, 2) or RIGHT if column 0/1 looks contested by Snake #0. My tail is vacating the bottom right, which provides a safe escape route later.\n\nLEFT",

Not in own body [0:-1] or enemy body. Safe. No head-on risk: enemy cannot reach (1,2) this turn (only UP to (0,2) or DOWN to (0,0)).\n- **UP** to (0,3): Own body at (0,3) [0:-1]. Backwards. Self-collision. Death.\n- **DOWN** to (0,1): Current enemy head (not body). Assuming simultaneous move vacates it, empty for landing. Not in own [0:-1] or enemy body. Safe from static check. No head-on: enemy moves to (0,2) or (0,0), neither overlaps (0,1). However, post-move, enemy UP to (0,2) lands on my new body segment at (0,2), killing them; enemy DOWN avoids but cedes north path.\n\nSafe moves: RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n### Short-Term Prioritization\nEnemy likely DOWN to (0,0) for (1,0) apple (2 turns: t58 eat, +1 to 15). Cannot get it myself (min 3 turns). DOWN contests south but traps me in col0 (limited options, enemy body blocks (1,1); follow to row0 chase inefficient). RIGHT follows plan: positions east on open row2 cols1-4, blocks enemy north escape post-apple. From (1,2) t57, safe follow-ups: RIGHT (2,2), UP (1,3 empty), DOWN (1,1 enemy body\u2014avoid). Avoids head-on; enemy UP follows but longer body (15 vs. my 12) risks self-trap in coil.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update\nt57 RIGHT (1,2) len12, patrol row2 cols1-4 t58-60 block west-center. Let enemy eat (1,0) t58 (15 apples). Monitor: if enemy DOWN, slow to (7,2) (~8-10 turns via row0/1, risks south dead-end near own tail col9). From (4,2) t60, wait ~7-9 turns (t67-69) for (5,2)/(5,3) clear (8 behind +1 grow delay); then RIGHT row2/3 to (7,2) t70 eat len13 or (9,3) t68 len13 (prioritize closer (7,2) if enemy detours). If enemy UP t57 suicide (unlikely), win immediate. Post-eat, pivot north via col7-8 row3-8 (enemy coil clears slowly); target (2,8)/(1,8) t75-77 len15, sweep row8 for overtake (aim 18 by t90 vs enemy 16-17, control board post-t100).\n\nRIGHT",

No immediate enemy overlap.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Short-Term Prioritization\nUP to (3,6) maintains north trajectory in open column 3 (rows 6-8 empty), enabling direct path to (2,8)/(1,8) apples by t64-65 (eat len13-14) with 3+ follow-ups (e.g., from (3,6): UP empty, LEFT/RIGHT empty). LEFT to (2,5) viable but narrows options (crowds west body; next: UP (2,6) empty but then risks boxing vs. own shifting tail at (1,5)-(0,5); DOWN own body; RIGHT reverts). RIGHT to (4,5) drifts east unnecessarily (adds turns to apples; exposes to potential enemy north push from (5,0) via col4-5). UP optimizes apple proximity (Manhattan to (2,8): 3 vs. LEFT's 4+ detour, RIGHT's 5+), safety, and mobility.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update\nt62 UP (3,6) len12, t63 UP (3,7) len12, t64 UP (3,8) len12, t65 LEFT (2,8) eat len13, t66 LEFT (1,8) eat len14, t67 DOWN (1,7) len14 [row7 cols0-5 clear] to loop toward (6,7) t70 eat len15.

Manhattan distance to (2,8) is 1 (vs. LEFT's 2 via (2,7)-(2,8), or RIGHT's 3+ detour). No self-risk (tail at (0,5) won't shift into path yet). Enemy head (6,1) can't reach (3,8) this turn (distance 5+; likely moves UP to (6,2) or RIGHT to (7,1), both irrelevant).

Moving **UP** now to (7, 3) is also viable, but grabbing (9, 3) first secures a lead and keeps me away from Snake #0's head for longer.\n\n### Plan\nMove RIGHT to (8, 2), then target the apple at (9, 3). This keeps me in open space while my long tail clears out from the bottom row. After (9, 3), I will head upwards to secure the remaining apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Self-collision/backtrack. Death.\n- **LEFT** to (0,9): Empty (row9 col0 clear). Safe, but west isolation (no apples, constrains future east access); extra turns to pivot south/east, risks enemy claiming (5,8)/(6,8) first (~t70 enemy min, but path clear to them).\n- **RIGHT** to (2,9): Empty (row9 col2 clear). Safe, aligns with north row9 empty path (cols2-9 all .), no self-risk (tail at (0,3) advances east post-move, vacates bottom-left slowly); positions for sequential RIGHTs to (5,9) by t71.\n\nSafe moves: LEFT, RIGHT. Eliminate LEFT (suboptimal detour, delays multi-eat by 2-4 turns, enemy likely eats (9,3) t68-69 scoring 17-18 while I idle). RIGHT optimal: Maintains momentum, 0 collision risk (enemy Manhattan ~10+ away, focused south), enables 3-apple chain (5,8/6,8/6,7) by t74, tying score at 16 then leading 17-18.\n\n### Short-Term Prioritization\nRIGHT to (2,9) len14, tail to (0,4) [vacates (0,3)]. Follow: t69 RIGHT (3,9) empty, t70 (4,9), t71 (5,9) [tail to (1,3), opens row8 col1-2]; t72 DOWN (5,8) eat len15 score14 (row8 col5 empty), t73 RIGHT (6,8) eat len16 score15 (row8 col6 empty, no enemy overlap), t74 DOWN (6,7) eat len17 score16 (row7 col6 empty). Post-eat, RIGHT/UP if enemy contests (unlikely, their len17+ post-(9,3) slows north via col9 rows3-9 ~7 turns), else DOWN/LEFT to (1,7) via row7 col5-1 empty (~t78 score17 win). Avoids traps, leverages empty top for speed.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update\nSecure top apples for tie (16 by t74), then (1,7) for lead (17 by t78) before enemy north (~t75+). If enemy pivots east post-(9,3) (e.g., LEFT/UP col8-6), t73 pivot LEFT from (6,8) to (5,8) hold/encircle; len17 blocks their access. Monitor enemy head for collision bait\u2014post-t74, loop south row6 col6-1 empty to (1,7). Final: 18+ if (9,3) contested/vacated, or 17 draw/lead vs enemy 17-19. Prioritize survival over risk; if blocked, south fallback to enemy tail chase.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe, but directs south prematurely, missing immediate (1,7)/(2,7) apples; lengthens path to them by 3+ turns.\n- **LEFT**: (3,5) empty. Safe, follows prior plan to vacate (3,6) and enable col3 ascent.\n- **RIGHT**: (5,5) empty. Safe, but veers east toward enemy territory, risks detour and potential block on southern apples.\n\nThree safe moves. LEFT prioritizes quick access to two nearby apples (+2 to 18, tie) in t82/t83 with clear tail-chase path. DOWN/RIGHT delay this, allowing enemy potential repositioning (post-LEFT to (6,9), enemy may DOWN to (6,8) empty, but still 7+ turns to threaten col1-2 row7).\n\nNo head-on risks: Enemy forced LEFT to (6,9), distant from my options. No other snakes.\n\n### Short-Term Prioritization\nLEFT to (3,5): Tail vacates (3,6) to (3,7). t80 UP (3,6 vacated). t81 UP (3,7 vacated, tail to (3,8)\u2192(2,8)). t82 LEFT (2,7) eat (+17). t83 LEFT (1,7) eat (+18 tie, grow to 19; (1,7) clear as col1 row7 empty post-eat). Path verified empty; enemy max reach by t83 ~ (6,6)-(4,8) via aggressive path, can't intercept col1-3 row7. Post-tie, t84 DOWN (1,6 empty) secures south uncontested. Avoid DOWN/RIGHT\u2014cedes apples, extends game risk as enemy length 19 could loop/block bottom.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update\nt79 LEFT (3,5) tail (3,7). t80 UP (3,6). t81 UP (3,7). t82 LEFT (2,7) eat 17. t83 LEFT (1,7) eat 18. t84 DOWN (1,6). t85 DOWN (1,5). t86 DOWN (1,4). t87 DOWN (1,3) eat 19. t88 LEFT (0,3). t89 DOWN (0,2) eat 20 (+2 lead). t90 RIGHT (1,2 empty). t91+ RIGHT/UP to row0 col7 for (7,0) ~t96 (+21), via col1-7 row0/1 (empty strip post-tail moves; monitor enemy for traps). At 21 vs 18, defend south/west; bait enemy into self-collision on their long body. If enemy pursues south, circle north to block. Growth edge enables traps; target 30+ by t120 for win margin.\n\nLEFT",

Let's double-check the board and body lists carefully. \n    Snake #0 Body: (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7).\n    My Head is at (6, 9).\n    - Left is (5, 9): Snake #0 Body.\n    - Down is (6, 8): Snake #0 Body.\n    - Right is (7, 9): My Body.\n    - Up is (6, 10): Wall.\n\n    Wait, I must check if Snake #0's tail will move. Its current body length is 16. The head is at (3, 5). The sequence provided is head-to-tail. The very last element listed for Snake #0 is (3, 7). This means (3, 7) is the tail and will move this turn. However, (5, 9) and (6, 8) are in the middle/early part of its body sequence and will not clear this turn.\n\n    Is there any error in my coordinate reading? \n    My Body: (6, 9) head, (7, 9) index 1. \n    Right (7, 9) is definitely my body.\n    Left (5, 9) is Snake #0's body (index 7).\n    Down (6, 8) is Snake #0's body (index 5).\n    Up (6, 10) is Wall.\n\n    Based on the provided coordinate lists, all directions lead to a collision. However, since I must provide a move, I will choose the one that might potentially clear if the enemy snake were shorter than the list suggests, or simply to follow the rules of the prompt. Comparing (5, 9) and (6, 8), (6, 8) is technically \"older\" in its body sequence than (5, 9) if we count from the head, but both are occupied.\n\n### Plan\nThe current position at (6, 9) is highly constrained by the enemy's body and my own tail. There are no available empty cells. I will move LEFT and hope for a processing discrepancy or tail movement.\n\nLEFT",

No head-on risk: enemy head (6,9) DOWN blocked by own/my body at (6,8); their LEFT (5,9) own, RIGHT (7,9) own, UP off-board\u2014likely forced DOWN but still distant.\n\n### Short-Term Prioritization\nUP to (3,6): t81 UP (3,7 vacated), t82 LEFT (2,7) eat +17, t83 LEFT (1,7) eat +18.
