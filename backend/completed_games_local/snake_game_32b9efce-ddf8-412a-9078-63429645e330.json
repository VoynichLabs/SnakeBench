So no apple at (6,0).]\n- Enemy snake #1: Head at (6,0), body: [(7,0)]\n\n**Possible moves from my head (6,6):**\n- UP: (6,7) - empty\n- DOWN: (6,5) - empty\n- LEFT: (5,6) - has an apple!\n- RIGHT: (7,6) - empty\n\nAll moves are safe (no walls, no bodies; enemy is far away at (6,0)).\n\n**Enemy position and threats:**\nEnemy at (6,0) with body at (7,0). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (6,1) - empty\n- DOWN: invalid (off board)\n- LEFT: (5,0) - empty\n- RIGHT: (7,0) - but (7,0) is its own body! So RIGHT is not allowed (would hit its own body). So enemy can only go UP or LEFT.\n\nNo immediate threat to me from enemy since we are 6 units apart in y-direction.\n\n**Closest apples:**\nFrom (6,6):\n- (5,6): distance 1 (LEFT)\n- (3,6): distance 3 (LEFT twice then left again? Actually |6-3| + |6-6| = 3)\n- (5,8): |6-5| + |6-8| = 1+2=3\n- (9,7): |6-9| + |6-7| = 3+1=4\n- (1,7): |6-1| + |6-7| = 5+1=6\n\nSo (5,6) is adjacent to me (LEFT). I can eat it this turn by moving LEFT.\n\n**What happens if I move LEFT to (5,6)?**\n- I eat the apple at (5,6).\n- I grow by 1 segment: my snake will now have a body segment at (6,6) (my previous head position).\n- My head moves to (5,6).\n- I gain 1 apple.\n\nThis is highly beneficial.\n\nOther moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) do not get me an apple this turn and would leave the apple at (5,6) for later, but why delay? Eating it now is safe and grows my snake.\n\n**Future mobility after eating:**\nAfter moving to (5,6) and having body at (6,6), my next moves from (5,6) would be:\n- UP: (5,7) - empty\n- DOWN: (5,5) - empty\n- LEFT: (4,6) - empty\n- RIGHT: (6,6) - but that is my body! So RIGHT would be invalid next turn (hitting my own body). So I would have 3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, LEFT).\n\nThat is still good mobility.\n\nIf I don't eat the apple now (e.g., go UP to (6,7)), then next turn I might have to compete for it? But enemy is far away. However, there is no reason to avoid it.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nEat the apple at (5,6) this turn. Then from (5,6), consider moving towards (5,8) or (3,6) or other apples. Since (5,8) is above, and (3,6) is to the left, I might prefer UP to (5,7) next to get closer to (5,8) (distance from (5,7) to (5,8) is 1) or LEFT to (4,6) to get closer to (3,6). But that decision can be made next turn.\n\nNo risk from enemy who is stuck at the bottom (only can move UP or LEFT).\n\nTherefore, the best move is to go LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nLEFT",

Moving DOWN would eat it.\n- (3,6) is 2 steps left (distance 2).\n- (5,8) is 2 steps up (distance 2).\n- (9,7) and (1,7) are farther.\n\n**Why eat (5,5) now?**\n- It's adjacent and safe (DOWN is safe).\n- Eating it grows my snake to length 3 (head + 2 body segments).\n- After eating, my body will be at [(6,6), (5,6)] (in order: new head at (5,5), then body at (5,6), then (6,6)).\n- This gives me a longer body which can be useful for blocking enemies later.\n\n**Future mobility after eating (if I go DOWN):**\nNext turn from (5,5):\n- UP: (5,6) - my body (so invalid)\n- DOWN: (5,4) - empty\n- LEFT: (4,5) - empty\n- RIGHT: (6,5) - empty\nSo I would have 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Good mobility.\n\n**Alternatives:**\n- UP to (5,7): no apple, but gets closer to (5,8). Next turn from (5,7): safe moves would be UP (to (5,8) for apple), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7) - all empty. Also good.\n- LEFT to (4,6): no apple, but gets closer to (3,6). Next turn from (4,6): safe moves UP (4,7), DOWN (4,5), LEFT (3,6) for apple - all safe.\n\nAll safe moves have benefits, but eating the apple at (5,5) immediately is very efficient. It grows me and removes an apple that is right there.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating (5,5), I will be at (5,5) with body at (5,6) and (6,6). Then I can consider moving towards (3,6) (via LEFT) or (5,8) (via UP from (5,5) is blocked by body, so I would need to go LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT first and then UP later? Actually, from (5,5) I cannot go UP because (5,6) is body. So to reach (5,8), I might need to go left or right and then up. Alternatively, I could target (3,6) next which is closer.\n\nBut since (5,8) is only 3 steps away (manhattan) and (3,6) is 2 steps away, I might prefer (3,6) after this. However, I can decide next turn.\n\nFor now, eating the apple at (5,5) is the most direct way to grow.\n\n**No risk from enemy:**\nEnemy is moving UP or LEFT from (5,0), so it is moving away from me. No head-on collision risk.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN to eat the apple.\n\nDOWN",

No immediate threat.\n\n**Apples:**\n- (3,6) is 2 steps left and 1 up (manhattan distance 3): requires LEFT then UP (or LEFT then LEFT? Actually (3,6) is at x=3,y=6, so from (5,5): going LEFT twice to (3,5) and then UP to (3,6) would work.\n- (5,8) is 3 steps up, but I cannot go UP directly from (5,5) because my body is there. So I need to go sideways first (LEFT or RIGHT) and then UP later.\n- (4,3) is 2 steps down and 1 left (manhattan distance 3): DOWN then LEFT (or LEFT then DOWN).\n- (9,7) and (1,7) are farther.\n\n**Best targets:**\n(3,6) and (4,3) are the closest apples (manhattan distance 3 each). (5,8) is also close but requires detour.\n\n**Mobility after each move:**\n- DOWN to (5,4): \n  - Next turn from (5,4): UP (5,5) - body? Actually, after moving DOWN, my body will be at [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6)] so (5,5) is body. So UP is not safe. DOWN (5,3) - empty, LEFT (4,4) - empty, RIGHT (6,4) - empty. So 3 safe moves.\n- LEFT to (4,5):\n  - Next turn from (4,5): UP (4,6) - empty, DOWN (4,4) - empty, LEFT (3,5) - empty, RIGHT (5,5) - body. So 3 safe moves.\n- RIGHT to (6,5):\n  - Next turn from (6,5): UP (6,6) - body, DOWN (6,4) - empty, LEFT (5,5) - body, RIGHT (7,5) - empty. So only 2 safe moves (DOWN and RIGHT).\n\nSo RIGHT has worse future mobility (only 2 options). DOWN and LEFT both have 3.\n\n**Which apple to target?**\n- LEFT moves me towards (3,6) (which is at (3,6)).\n- DOWN moves me towards (4,3) (which is at (4,3)).\n\nBoth are equally close. However, (3,6) is at y=6, which is closer to my current y=5 than (4,3) at y=3. So (3,6) is slightly more accessible.\n\nAlso, going LEFT now puts me at (4,5), from which I can go UP to (4,6) next turn and then LEFT to (3,6) to eat the apple. Alternatively, from (4,5) I can go LEFT to (3,5) and then UP to (3,6).\n\nGoing DOWN to (5,4) would require two moves to reach (4,3): e.g., DOWN to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4), then DOWN to (4,3)? Actually (4,3) is at y=3, so from (5,4) I need to go DOWN to (5,3) and then LEFT to (4,3) or LEFT to (4,4) and then DOWN to (4,3). So same number of steps.\n\nBut LEFT seems more direct for (3,6), and (3,6) is closer in y.\n\nAlso, note that (5,8) is above, and after going LEFT I might be able to circle around to it later.\n\n**Avoid enemy?**\nEnemy is at (5,1) and might move UP to (5,2), which is still far. No issue.\n\n**Decision:**\nLEFT is better than RIGHT because it gives better future mobility (3 options vs 2) and moves me towards the apple at (3,6). DOWN is also good, but LEFT is more direct for the nearest apple.\n\nSo choose LEFT.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (4,5), next turn aim to go UP to (4,6) to get closer to (3,6). Then eat (3,6) by going LEFT to (3,6). Alternatively, from (4,5) I could go LEFT to (3,5) and then UP to (3,6). Either way works.\n\nLEFT",

Let's simulate:  \n    Current body: [(4,5) is head, old body is (5,5), (5,6)].  \n    After moving UP: head = (4,6), body = [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6)] \u2192 so DOWN to (4,5) is body (not safe).  \n    LEFT: (3,6) \u2192 empty.  \n    RIGHT: (5,6) \u2192 body.  \n    So next turn from (4,6): only UP and LEFT safe (2 moves).  \n\n- **DOWN to (4, 4):**  \n  Next turn body: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]  \n  From (4,4): UP (4,5) \u2192 body \u274c, DOWN (4,3) \u2192 empty \u2705, LEFT (3,4) \u2192 empty \u2705, RIGHT (5,4) \u2192 empty \u2705 \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n- **LEFT to (3, 5):**  \n  Next turn body same as above: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,6)]  \n  From (3,5): UP (3,6) \u2192 empty \u2705, DOWN (3,4) \u2192 empty \u2705, LEFT (2,5) \u2192 empty \u2705, RIGHT (4,5) \u2192 body \u274c \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nSo UP yields only 2 safe moves next turn (riskier), DOWN and LEFT yield 3.  \n\n**Targeting apples:**  \nClosest apples by Manhattan distance from (4,5):  \n- (3,6): distance 2 (1 left, 1 up)  \n- (4,3): distance 2 (2 down)  \n- (5,8): distance 4  \n\nFrom (4,5):  \n- **DOWN** towards (4,3): next move DOWN to (4,4) then DOWN to (4,3) eats it in 2 turns.  \n- **LEFT** towards (3,6): next move LEFT to (3,5) then UP to (3,6) eats it in 2 turns.  \n\nBoth equally close, but need to check safety involving enemy:  \nEnemy at (5,2) can move UP to (5,3), RIGHT to (6,2), LEFT to (4,2), but not threatening me immediately.  \n\nUP is tempting for (3,6) but reduces future mobility. Better to go LEFT: gets me to (3,5) and then UP to (3,6) next turn safely with good options.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nLEFT is safer for mobility and targets apple (3,6).  \n\nLEFT",

No other apples are closer.\n- I have one tail segment at (5,1).\n\nMove options:\n- UP: Moves into open space towards the apple at (5,8).

Keeps me alive but doesn't progress towards my goal.\n\nGiven this, moving UP is the clear best choice. It moves me towards the nearest apple while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake.

Eating it would grow me to length 4 (head at (3,6), body becomes [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]). This is highly beneficial.\n- DOWN (3,4): Safe, but moves away from most apples.\n- LEFT (2,5): Safe, but not towards any immediate apple.\n\n**Safety considerations:**\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (5,3). It can move UP to (5,4), DOWN to (5,2) (its own body), LEFT to (4,3) (empty), or RIGHT to (6,3) (empty). So it has safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- There is no immediate threat of collision with the enemy: it is 2 cells away (Manhattan distance |3-5| + |5-3| = 2+2=4). Even if it moves towards me, it cannot reach (3,6) in one turn.\n- Moving UP to (3,6) is safe: no snake body there, and enemy cannot get there this turn.\n\n**Future mobility after UP:**\nAfter moving UP to (3,6) and eating the apple, my body becomes [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5)].\nNext turn, from head (3,6):\n- UP: (3,7) \u2192 empty\n- DOWN: (3,5) \u2192 my body \u274c\n- LEFT: (2,6) \u2192 empty\n- RIGHT: (4,6) \u2192 empty\nSo I would have 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) \u2014 good mobility.\n\n**Targeting apples:**\nThe closest apple is (3,6) \u2014 right above me. UP directly eats it. Other apples are farther: (4,3) is 3 moves away (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN), (5,8) is 5 moves, etc.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nUP is the best move: it immediately eats an apple, is safe, and maintains good future mobility. DOWN and LEFT are safe but less productive.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**\nAfter eating (3,6), consider moving towards (5,8) or (1,7) while avoiding enemy. Enemy at (5,3) might be heading towards (4,3) apple? Monitor its moves.\n\nUP",

Actually (3,7) is empty, and it's a step towards the top row where apples are.\n- LEFT (2,6): Moves away from most apples? But (1,7) is to the left and up.\n- RIGHT (4,6): Moves towards the center and potentially towards (5,8) apple.\n\n**Safety considerations:**\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (6,3). It can move UP to (6,4), DOWN to (6,2), LEFT to (5,3) (its own body \u274c), or RIGHT to (7,3). So safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n- The enemy is far away (Manhattan distance |3-6| + |6-3| = 3+3=6). No immediate threat.\n- All safe moves are distant from enemy.\n\n**Targeting apples:**\n- Closest apple is (4,3) at distance |3-4| + |6-3| = 1+3=4.\n- (5,8) is |3-5| + |6-8| = 2+2=4.\n- (1,7) is |3-1| + |6-7| = 2+1=3.\n- (9,7) is |3-9| + |6-7| = 6+1=7.\n- (8,0) is |3-8| + |6-0| = 5+6=11.\n\nSo (1,7) is closest (3 moves away). To get to (1,7), I need to go LEFT and UP. From (3,6), moving LEFT to (2,6) is a step in that direction.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4,6) is a step towards (5,8) (which is also 4 moves away, but requires UP and RIGHT).\n\n**Future mobility after each move:**\n- After UP (3,7): \n  Next moves: UP (3,8), DOWN (3,6) \u274c (body), LEFT (2,7), RIGHT (4,7) \u2192 3 safe moves.\n- After LEFT (2,6):\n  Next moves: UP (2,7), DOWN (2,5), LEFT (1,6), RIGHT (3,6) \u274c (body) \u2192 3 safe moves.\n- After RIGHT (4,6):\n  Next moves: UP (4,7), DOWN (4,5) \u274c (body? (4,5) is my body segment), LEFT (3,6) \u274c, RIGHT (5,6) \u2192 only 2 safe moves? Wait: body is [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5)]. So (4,5) is occupied. So from (4,6):\n  - UP: (4,7) empty\n  - DOWN: (4,5) my body \u274c\n  - LEFT: (3,6) my body \u274c (since I just left it? But next turn it will be occupied by my body segment)\n  - RIGHT: (5,6) empty\n  So only 2 safe moves: UP and RIGHT. This is worse.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT has poor future mobility (only 2 options). UP and LEFT both have 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n**Comparing UP and LEFT:**\n- UP (3,7): moves towards (1,7) and (9,7)? Actually (1,7) is left and up, so UP alone doesn't get closer in x.\n- LEFT (2,6): directly reduces x towards (1,7), and then next move UP to (2,7) gets closer.\n\nLEFT seems better for targeting (1,7).\n\nAlso, there is an apple at (4,3) below, but going DOWN is not safe now. I might consider it later.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (2,6), I can then go UP to (2,7) and then LEFT to (1,7) to eat that apple. This path seems safe and efficient.\n\nEnemy is at (6,3) and might go for (4,3) apple? But I am far.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLEFT is the best move: it moves towards the closest apple (1,7), has good future mobility (3 safe moves next turn), and is safe. UP is also good but less direct for (1,7). RIGHT has poor mobility.\n\nLEFT\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**\nAfter moving to (2,6), plan to go UP to (2,7) and then LEFT to (1,7) to eat the apple. Monitor enemy movement towards (4,3) or other apples. Avoid getting trapped in corners.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state after turn 9.\n\n**Current state:**\n- My snake (ID 0): head at (2,6), body: [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5)] (since I just moved left to (2,6))\n- Apples: (9,7), (1,7), (5,8), (4,3), (8,0)\n- Enemy snake #1: head at (5,3), body: [(6,3)]\n\n**Possible moves from my head (2,6):**\n- UP: (2,7) \u2192 empty \u2705\n- DOWN: (2,5) \u2192 empty \u2705\n- LEFT: (1,6) \u2192 empty \u2705\n- RIGHT: (3,6) \u2192 my body \u274c (this is the segment immediately behind my head)\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Evaluating safe moves:**\n- UP (2,7): Moves towards the apple at (1,7) (only 1 step away in x and same y? Actually (1,7) is at x=1, y=7. From (2,7), I can go LEFT to (1,7) to eat it next turn.\n- DOWN (2,5): Moves away from most apples? But there is an apple at (4,3) below, which is 2 steps down and 2 right? Actually (4,3) is at x=4,y=3. From (2,5), it's |2-4| + |5-3| = 2+2=4 moves away.\n- LEFT (1,6): Moves directly towards (1,7) apple? Actually (1,6) is below (1,7). From (1,6), I can go UP to (1,7) next turn to eat the apple.\n\n**Closest apple is (1,7) at Manhattan distance |2-1| + |6-7| = 1+1=2.**\n- To reach (1,7): I need to go LEFT and then UP (or UP and then LEFT? Actually both sequences are equivalent in steps. But if I go LEFT first to (1,6), then UP to (1,7). Or UP first to (2,7), then LEFT to (1,7).\n\n**Safety considerations:**\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (5,3). It can move UP to (5,4), DOWN to (5,2), LEFT to (4,3) (apple present), or RIGHT to (6,3) (its own body \u274c). So safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n- The enemy is far (Manhattan |2-5| + |6-3| = 3+3=6). No immediate threat.\n- I should avoid moving into areas that might be contested by the enemy? The apple at (4,3) is closer to the enemy (|5-4| + |3-3|=1) than to me (|2-4| + |6-3|=2+3=5). So the enemy will likely get (4,3) first. I should focus on (1,7).\n\n**Future mobility after each move:**\n- After UP (2,7):\n  Next moves: UP (2,8), DOWN (2,6) \u274c (body), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7) \u2192 3 safe moves.\n  Also, (1,7) is adjacent to (2,7) via LEFT.\n- After DOWN (2,5):\n  Next moves: UP (2,6) \u274c, DOWN (2,4), LEFT (1,5), RIGHT (3,5) \u274c (my body at (3,5)) \u2192 only 2 safe moves? Wait: body is [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5)]. So (3,5) is occupied. So:\n    UP: (2,6) is my body \u274c\n    DOWN: (2,4) empty\n    LEFT: (1,5) empty\n    RIGHT: (3,5) my body \u274c\n  So only 2 safe moves: DOWN and LEFT. This is poor.\n- After LEFT (1,6):\n  Next moves: UP (1,7), DOWN (1,5), LEFT (0,6), RIGHT (2,6) \u274c \u2192 3 safe moves.\n  (1,7) is adjacent via UP.\n\nSo DOWN has poor future mobility (only 2 options). UP and LEFT both have 3 safe moves.\n\n**Comparing UP and LEFT:**\n- Both lead equally well to (1,7): UP gets to (2,7) and then LEFT to (1,7); LEFT gets to (1,6) and then UP to (1,7).\n- However, if I go LEFT to (1,6), I am one step away from (1,7) and can eat it next turn.\n- If I go UP to (2,7), I am also one step away from (1, and (9,7)? But (1,7) is the closest.\n\n**Decision:**\nI want to eat (1,7) as soon as possible. Going LEFT to (1,6) puts me directly below the apple, and next turn I can move UP to eat it. Going UP to (2,7) puts me to the right of the apple, and next turn I can move LEFT to eat it.\n\nBoth are equally good in terms of steps. However, after eating (1,7), my body will grow. So I need to consider the state after eating.\n\nBut for this turn, both UP and LEFT are safe and efficient.\n\n**Why not DOWN?** DOWN has poor mobility (only 2 moves next turn) and moves me away from the closest apple.\n\n**Slight preference for LEFT:**\n- Moving LEFT to (1,6) might be slightly better because it gets me closer to the left edge, but there is no immediate danger. The board has apples on the left.\n- Also, if I go LEFT, I avoid potential future conflict with the enemy over (4,3)? Not directly.\n\nActually, both are similar. But since my last move was LEFT, and I planned to go UP next, I should continue that plan.\n\n**Last rationale plan:** \"After moving to (2,6), plan to go UP to (2,7) and then LEFT to (1,7) to eat the apple.\"\n\nSo I should go UP to (2,7) now, as planned.\n\nThen next turn, I can go LEFT to (1,7) to eat the apple.\n\nThis follows the plan exactly.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,6), I deviate from the plan (which said go UP first). But it is also valid.\n\nHowever, to stick to the plan and for consistency, I'll go UP.\n\n**Final choice: UP**\n- It is safe.\n- It has good future mobility.\n- It executes the plan to go to (2,7) and then LEFT to (1,7) next turn.\n- It avoids DOWN which has poor mobility.\n\nUP\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**\nAfter moving to (2,7), go LEFT to (1,7) to eat the apple. Then consider next targets: (5,8) or (9,7). Avoid moving into the enemy's path towards (4,3). Monitor enemy movement.\n\nUP",

Eating it will grow my snake. But I must check for safety after eating: my body will extend to include the current tail (3,5) so the new tail will be (3,5) after growth? Actually, when eating an apple, the body grows by adding the current head position as a new segment before moving the head. So after moving to (1,7) and eating, my body becomes: [(1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)] \u2014 so 5 segments.\n- UP (2,8): moves toward apple (5,8) but also away from (1,7). \n- RIGHT (3,7): moves away from both (1,7) and (5,8).\n\n**Safety considerations:**\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (4,3). It can move UP (4,4), DOWN (4,2), LEFT (3,3), RIGHT (5,3) \u274c (its body). So it has 3 safe moves. It is likely to go for the apple at (3,4) via UP and LEFT? Actually (3,4) is adjacent to (4,3) via LEFT and UP? Manhattan: |4-3| + |3-4| = 2. The enemy can reach (3,4) in two moves (e.g., LEFT to (3,3) then UP to (3,4), or UP to (4,4) then LEFT to (3,4)). But the enemy is not an immediate threat to me since it's far away (Manhattan distance |2-4| + |7-3| = 2+4=6).\n\n**Future mobility after each move:**\n- If I go LEFT to (1,7) and eat the apple:\n  Next turn my head will be at (1,7). Then possible moves:\n    UP: (1,8) \u2014 empty?\n    DOWN: (1,6) \u2014 empty? But check: my body will be [(1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]. So (1,6) is empty now.\n    LEFT: (0,7) \u2014 empty.\n    RIGHT: (2,7) \u2014 my body \u274c.\n  So 3 safe moves next turn after eating.\n- If I go UP to (2,8):\n  Next turns: UP (2,9), DOWN (2,7) \u274c, LEFT (1,8), RIGHT (3,8) \u2192 3 safe moves.\n- If I go RIGHT to (3,7):\n  Next turns: UP (3,8), DOWN (3,6) \u274c (my body at (3,6)), LEFT (2,7) \u274c (body), RIGHT (4,7) \u2192 only 2 safe moves? Wait: body is [(2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]. So (3,6) is occupied, so DOWN is \u274c; (2,7) is occupied? Actually (2,7) is my current head \u2014 but after moving to (3,7), my body becomes [(3,7), (2,6), (3,6), (3,5)]? Let's trace: head moves to (3,7), then the body follows: the segment behind head (2,6) moves to old head (2,7)? No \u2014 the body follows: the first body segment (2,6) moves to (2,7), then (3,6) moves to (2,6), then (3,5) moves to (3,6). So new body: [(3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6)]. So next turn from (3,7):\n    UP: (3,8) empty\n    DOWN: (3,6) \u274c (body)\n    LEFT: (2,7) \u274c (body)\n    RIGHT: (4,7) empty\n  So only 2 safe moves: UP and RIGHT. Poor mobility.\n\nSo RIGHT is less desirable due to poor future mobility.\n\n**Comparing UP and LEFT:**\n- LEFT gets me an apple immediately and keeps good mobility (3 moves next turn).\n- UP also keeps good mobility but delays eating the apple at (1,7). However, the enemy is far, so the apple at (1,7) is safe for now. But if I don't take it now, I can take it next turn? Actually if I go UP to (2,8), next turn I can go DOWN to (2,7) \u274c (body will be there) \u2014 wait, next turn after UP: body will be [(2,8), (2,7), (3,6), (3,5)]. So (2,7) will be body, so I cannot go DOWN to (2,7) from (2,8). So from (2,8), to reach (1,7) I'd have to go LEFT to (1,8) and then DOWN to (1,7) \u2014 that's two moves. So going UP delays eating (1,7) by at least two moves.\n\nThus LEFT is better for immediate apple consumption.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating (1,7), consider going for (5,8) or (9,7). Avoid areas near enemy snake #1. Monitor enemy movement \u2014 it will likely take (3,4) soon.\n\n**Final choice: LEFT** \u2014 eat the apple at (1,7) now for growth and points, maintain good mobility, and stay safe.\n\nLEFT",

Wait, it had 2 segments last turn? Actually last turn enemy had head (4,3) and body [(5,3), (6,3)] \u2014 3 segments. But now it moved: head is at (3,3), so it must have moved LEFT. Its body now: [(4,3), (5,3)]? Actually, after moving LEFT to (3,3), the body follows: the segment behind head (4,3) moves to old head (4,3)? Wait, let's reconstruct: previous head (4,3), body [(5,3), (6,3)]. After moving LEFT to (3,3), the head is at (3,3). Then the first body segment (5,3) moves to (4,3) (old head), and (6,3) moves to (5,3). So new body: [(3,3), (4,3), (5,3)]? But the state says head (3,3) and body [(4,3), (5,3)] \u2014 so it has 3 segments total (head + 2 body). So enemy has grown? It didn't eat an apple this turn? There is an apple at (3,4) adjacent to its old head (4,3). But it moved LEFT to (3,3) instead of UP to (4,4) or LEFT to (3,3) \u2014 actually (3,4) is not directly adjacent to (4,3)? Manhattan distance 1: (4,3) to (3,4) is |4-3| + |3-4|=2, not adjacent. So it didn't eat an apple. So enemy has 3 segments (head and 2 body).\n\n**Possible moves from my head (1,7):**\n- UP: (1,8) \u2192 empty \u2705\n- DOWN: (1,6) \u2192 empty \u2705\n- LEFT: (0,7) \u2192 empty \u2705\n- RIGHT: (2,7) \u2192 my body \u274c (this is the segment directly behind my head)\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Evaluating safe moves:**\n- UP (1,8): moves toward apple (5,8) and (9,7). Also keeps good future options.\n- DOWN (1,6): moves away from apples, but might be useful to avoid enemy or explore.\n- LEFT (0,7): moves to the edge. From there, only UP (0,8), DOWN (0,6), RIGHT (1,7) \u274c (body). So 2 safe moves next turn.\n\n**Future mobility after each move:**\n- UP (1,8): \n  Next turn, body will be [(1,8), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6)] (tail (3,5) drops off).\n  Then moves: UP (1,9), DOWN (1,7) \u274c, LEFT (0,8), RIGHT (2,8) \u2192 3 safe moves.\n- DOWN (1,6):\n  Next turn, body: [(1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6)] (tail drops off).\n  Then moves: UP (1,7) \u274c, DOWN (1,5), LEFT (0,6), RIGHT (2,6) \u274c (body at (2,6)) \u2192 only 2 safe moves (DOWN and LEFT).\n- LEFT (0,7):\n  Next turn, body: [(0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6)] (tail drops off).\n  Then moves: UP (0,8), DOWN (0,6), RIGHT (1,7) \u274c \u2192 2 safe moves.\n\nSo UP has the best future mobility (3 moves), while DOWN and LEFT have only 2.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\n- Apple (5,8) is at distance |1-5| + |8-8| = 4.\n- Apple (9,7) is at |1-9| + |7-7| = 8.\n- Apple (8,0) is far.\n- Apple (3,4) is close to enemy.\n- Apple (0,2) is at |1-0| + |7-2| = 1+5=6.\n\nUP moves closer to (5,8) and (9,7). DOWN moves away from most apples. LEFT moves along the edge but not directly toward any apple (except (0,2) is below, but DOWN would be better for that).\n\n**Enemy snake #1 at (3,3):**\nIt has 3 segments. It can move UP (3,4) (apple!), DOWN (3,2), LEFT (2,3), RIGHT (4,3) \u274c (its body at (4,3)). So safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\nIt is likely to go UP to (3,4) to eat the apple. That will grow it to 4 segments. But it is not an immediate threat to me (Manhattan distance |1-3| + |7-3| = 2+4=6).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter this move, aim for apple (5,8) or (9,7).

So no head-on there.  \nHowever, if I eat apple at (5, 8), next turn my length is 6, but my tail won't move. Enemy is far enough away at ~5 Manhattan distance (enemy at (2,4) to (5,8) distance x_diff=3, y_diff=4 = 7 steps apart actually). So no risk.\n\nBut consider: If I go RIGHT to apple, next turn from (5, 8):  \nMy body will be: head (5,8), then (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7).  \nPossible moves from (5,8) next turn:  \nUP=(5,9) \u2705, DOWN=(5,7) \u2705, LEFT=(4,8) body \u274c, RIGHT=(6,8) \u2705. So 3 safe moves. Seems okay.\n\nAlso, taking apple brings me to 5 apples vs enemy's 3 \u2014 extending lead is good.\n\n---\n\n**UP alternative**: goes toward top edge but no apple nearby \u2014 maybe explore but less direct reward. Could be safer in terms of avoiding future entrapment? Let's see:  \nFrom (4,9) next turn: only LEFT=(3,9) and RIGHT=(5,9) safe (2 moves) \u2014 limited.\n\n**DOWN alternative**: to (4,7): safe now, but gets me no apple, away from apple cluster. From (4,7) next turn: UP=(4,8) body \u274c, DOWN=(4,6) \u2705, LEFT=(3,7) \u2705, RIGHT=(5,7) \u2705 \u2014 3 safe moves. But enemy might move toward center.\n\n---\n\nBetween UP (2 safe moves), DOWN (3 safe moves), RIGHT (3 safe moves + apple): RIGHT is clearly beneficial for score and maintaining mobility.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan**:  \nAfter getting (5,8) apple, consider going to (6,8) or (5,9) depending on safety vs enemy movement. Enemy likely heading towards center apples eventually \u2014 watch for (9,7) or (9,4) routes later. Keep lead and avoid being near enemy head when possible.\n\nRIGHT",

Board shows (1,5) is empty? Yes, row 5 col 1 is empty.\n- DOWN: (1,3) \u2014 empty\n- LEFT: (0,4) \u2014 empty (but edge)\n- RIGHT: (2,4) \u2014 its own body \u274c\n\nSo enemy can go UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow, check for head-on collisions:\n- My UP (5,9): enemy cannot reach (5,9) in one move (distance 4 in x, 5 in y) \u2014 safe.\n- My DOWN (5,7): enemy cannot reach (5,7) \u2014 safe.\n- My RIGHT (6,8): enemy cannot reach (6,8) \u2014 safe.\n\nNo immediate head-on risk.\n\n---\n\n**Apple targeting:**\n- Closest apple to me: (9,7) is 4 steps away (x+4, y-1), (9,4) is 5 steps (x+4, y-4), (8,9) is 3 steps (x+3, y+1), (0,2) and (8,0) are far.\n- (8,9) is very close: from (5,8) to (8,9) is x+3, y+1. I can go RIGHT then UP? Or UP then RIGHT? But currently at (5,8), going RIGHT to (6,8) gets me closer to (8,9). Then next turn from (6,8) I can go RIGHT again to (7,8) and then UP to (7,9) and RIGHT to (8,9)? Actually, direct path: to reach (8,9) I need to go RIGHT three times and UP once. But I might need to avoid obstacles.\n\nAlternatively, (9,7) is also attractive: from (5,8) to (9,7) is x+4, y-1. So going RIGHT multiple times and then DOWN? But first step RIGHT is good.\n\nAlso, (9,4) is below, but farther.\n\nGiven my position, RIGHT seems to progress toward both (8,9) and (9,7) (since (8,9) is top-right and (9,7) is right and slightly down).\n\nUP would go to (5,9) \u2014 which is closer to (8,9)? Actually (5,9) to (8,9) is x+3, same y. But from (5,9) I have only LEFT and RIGHT? (UP would be off board). So limited options.\n\nDOWN to (5,7) \u2014 moves away from most apples except (9,7) which is still far.\n\nSo RIGHT is best for apple pursuit.\n\n---\n\n**Future mobility:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (6,8):\n- My new body: head (6,8), then (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7) \u2014 length 6 (since I didn't eat apple).\n- From (6,8), next turn moves: UP=(6,9), DOWN=(6,7), LEFT=(5,8) body \u274c, RIGHT=(7,8). So 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good.\n\nIf I go UP to (5,9):\n- From (5,9): next turn moves: LEFT=(4,9), RIGHT=(6,9), DOWN=(5,8) body \u274c. So only 2 safe moves. Worse.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (5,7):\n- From (5,7): next turn moves: UP=(5,8) body \u274c, DOWN=(5,6), LEFT=(4,7), RIGHT=(6,7). So 3 safe moves. But not progressing toward apples.\n\nSo RIGHT offers both good mobility and progress toward apples.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy behavior:**\nEnemy is at (1,4) with length 4. It might be heading toward (0,2) apple? Or (8,0) is far. It is not an immediate threat to me due to distance.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nRIGHT is the best move: it is safe, maintains high mobility (3 moves next turn), and moves me toward the cluster of apples at top-right (especially (8,9) and (9,7)).\n\nRIGHT",

Better mobility.  \n\n**DOWN (6,7):**  \nMoves somewhat toward (9,7) but further from (8,9). From (6,7): UP (6,8) \u274c, DOWN (6,6) \u2705, LEFT (5,7) \u2705, RIGHT (7,7) \u2705 \u2192 3 safe moves. OK but less apple progress.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy at (0,4) can move UP=(0,5), DOWN=(0,3), RIGHT=(1,4) \u274c (into body?), wait, body is [(1,4), (2,4), (2,5)]. So RIGHT=(1,4) is its own body segment \u274c. So enemy possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT=(invalid off board \u274c) \u2192 Oh! (0,4) LEFT is x=-1 off board \u274c. So enemy only UP or DOWN.  \n\nIt cannot reach near me in 1 move starting from (0,4).  \n\nThus no head-on risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nGoal: get (8,9) apple next, then perhaps (9,7). Should keep mobility high when possible. RIGHT now gives best next-move options and brings me closer to both top-right apples. After RIGHT, likely UP next turn to (7,9) then RIGHT to (8,9) apple \u2014 need to verify enemy won't interfere then.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:** UP is tempting for direct path but reduces future options seriously. Safer to pick RIGHT now, keep flexibility, and adjust next turn.  \n\nRIGHT",
