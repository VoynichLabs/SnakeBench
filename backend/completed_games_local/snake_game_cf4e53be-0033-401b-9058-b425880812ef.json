This is less efficient for gathering food.\n4.  **DOWN to (2, 5):** This square is empty and safe. Moving down places me in column 2, directly in line with the apple at (2, 1). This is the shortest path to food (5 moves away). It also maintains a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **DOWN** is the safest and most strategic move. It avoids immediate collisions and heads directly towards the nearest food source.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove down to (2, 5) to pursue the apple at (2, 1). Continue moving down the column as long as it remains safe and until the food is secured.\n\nDOWN",

This cell is occupied by my own body (specifically the neck). Moving into your own body results in death, as established in standard Snake game logic [opal.ils.unc.edu](https://opal.ils.unc.edu/~lblakej/snake-game/05-move-snake/).

This is a safe move into open space. Similar to LEFT, it does not advance me towards an objective.\n- **UP**: Moves to (5, 6). This cell contains an apple. Checking for collisions: My body does not occupy (5, 6). The enemy snake #1 has its head at (3, 6) and body at [(2, 6), (2, 5), (1, 5)]. The enemy is two cells away horizontally and cannot reach (5, 6) in a single turn to cause a head-on collision. Therefore, this move is safe and results in eating the apple.\n\nStrategy:\nThe primary objective is to consume food to grow and increase the score while staying alive.

According to the game mechanics [medium.com](https://medium.com/@balbirms/how-i-developed-the-snake-game-in-python-2025-9853a7d7e26f), eating food increases the snake's length. By taking this apple, I prevent the enemy from potentially contesting it later (though they are currently far) and improve my score position.\n\nPlan:\nMove UP to eat the apple at (5, 6). After eating, I will grow. I will then reassess the board to target the next available apple, likely considering (8, 3) or others depending on how the enemy moves [github.com](https://github.com/nataliaarseniuk/Snake-Game).\n\nUP",

The enemy is at (6, 6), giving me some breathing room. I need to wisely position myself for future apple collection while avoiding the enemy.\n\n**Apple targeting priority:**\n- **Medium-term**: (8, 6) - accessible via rightward movement with some planning\n- **Long-term**: (8, 3) and (0, 8) - opposite corners\n- **Avoid**: Risky confrontation with enemy near (6, 6)\n\n**Move evaluation:**\n- **UP**: Suicide into my own body - eliminated\n- **DOWN**: (4, 4) - Safe but puts me in tighter space near board edge\n- **LEFT**: (3, 5) - Good option, opens path toward left side apples\n- **RIGHT**: (5, 5) - Moves toward enemy but also toward (8, 6) apple\n\n**2-3 turn plan:**\nLEFT to (3, 5) is the optimal choice. It creates distance from the enemy at (6, 6) while positioning me to potentially loop around toward the apples at (1, 0) or (0, 8). The enemy is currently scoring more apples, so my priority should be safe apple collection rather than confrontation. From (3, 5), I'll have good mobility options while staying clear of the threatening enemy position.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",
