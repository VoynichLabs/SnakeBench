Enemy snake (ID 0) is at (9, 5) and is also length 1.\n\nApples are at: (0, 3), (7, 1), (9, 9), (4, 9), (2, 5).\n\nMy snake's head is $H_1 = (6, 1)$.\nEnemy snake's head is $H_0 = (9, 5)$.\n\nI need to find a safe move that preferably leads towards an apple.\n\nCurrent possible moves and their resultant positions:\n1. UP: (6, 2)\n2. DOWN: (6, 0)\n3. LEFT: (5, 1)\n4. RIGHT: (7, 1)\n\nSafety check:\n1. **Board boundary check:** All resulting positions are within the [0, 9] x [0, 9] grid. Safe.\n2. **Self-collision check:** I have no body segments, so no self-collision possible. Safe.\n3. **Enemy body collision check:** Enemy has no body segments, so no collision with enemy body possible. Safe.\n4. **Head-on collision check:** This requires predicting where $H_0$ might go. $H_0$ is far away at (9, 5). It's highly unlikely we collide head-on immediately. The shortest distance between us is $\\sqrt{(9-6)^2 + (5-1)^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5$. We cannot reach the same cell in 1 move. Safe.\n\nAll four moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe.\n\nNow let's look at apple proximity and preference.\nApples are at $A_1=(0, 3), A_2=(7, 1), A_3=(9, 9), A_4=(4, 9), A_5=(2, 5)$.\n\nMy current position is (6, 1).\n\nDistances (Manhattan distance, $D_M$):\n$D_M((6, 1), A_1 (0, 3)) = |6-0| + |1-3| = 6 + 2 = 8$.\n$D_M((6, 1), A_2 (7, 1)) = |6-7| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1$. This apple is reachable in 1 move!\n$D_M((6, 1), A_3 (9, 9)) = |6-9| + |1-9| = 3 + 8 = 11$.\n$D_M((6, 1), A_4 (4, 9)) = |6-4| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10$.\n$D_M((6, 1), A_5 (2, 5)) = |6-2| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8$.\n\nThe apple $A_2$ at (7, 1) is the closest. Moving RIGHT takes me exactly to (7, 1) and allows me to eat the apple immediately.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, $H_1$ moves to (7, 1). This is an apple. I will grow to length 2.\n\nThis is the optimal first move.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to eat the apple at (7, 1).\n\nRIGHT",
