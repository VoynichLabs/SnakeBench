Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (6,5)**: Empty cell. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (8,5)**: This is the current location of Snake #0's head. This would be a head-on collision if Snake #0 stays still. However, moves are simultaneous. Snake #0 could move away, leaving the cell empty. But if Snake #0 moves LEFT into (7,5) (my current cell), we would swap places without colliding. The danger is if Snake #0 chooses to stay still (RIGHT for them is off-board, so they might not). Moving RIGHT is risky and could cause a head-on collision. **I will eliminate RIGHT as too risky for an immediate, potentially fatal collision.**\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy movement and future safety.**\n\nSnake #0 at (8,5). Their safe moves are UP (8,6), DOWN (8,4), LEFT (7,5). RIGHT (9,5) is on the board and empty.\n*   If they move LEFT, they come to my current cell (7,5). That's safe for me if I've moved away.\n*   My goal is to avoid walking into their future head position and to get to apples.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate remaining moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) for strategic value.**\n\nApples are at: (4,7), (3,3), (6,3), (4,3), (2,9).\n*   **UP (7,6)**: Moves me north. Closest apple is (4,7) which is 3 left, 1 up. Puts me in a more central row.\n*   **DOWN (7,4)**: Moves me south. Closest apples are in the y=3 row: (6,3), (4,3), (3,3). (6,3) is 1 left, 1 down from (7,4).\n*   **LEFT (6,5)**: Moves me west. Closest apple is (6,3) which is 2 down. Also moves me slightly away from the enemy.\n\n**Step 4: Choose the best move.**\n\nMoving DOWN to (7,4) seems most promising. It directly aims towards the cluster of three apples at y=3, specifically putting me one step away from (6,3). It also keeps distance from Snake #0. Moving LEFT also works, but DOWN seems more directly productive.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:** After moving to (7,4), assess the path to (6,3).

From (6,4), I can go DOWN to (6,3) next turn to eat the apple, provided it's still there and the path is safe. Moving DOWN to (7,3) also works, but leaves me adjacent to the enemy's column. LEFT seems slightly safer strategically.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:** From (6,4), target apple (6,3) by moving DOWN, but first check that the cell is safe (not occupied by Snake #0's future head). If (6,3) is risky, consider alternative paths to other apples (4,3) or (3,3). Continue to monitor Snake #0's position to avoid head-on collisions.\n\n**Final Move:** LEFT",

Safe.\n\nAll four moves are immediately safe. No moves go off-board or into a snake body.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy movement and future safety.**\n\nSnake #0 is at (8,3). Their safe moves are UP (8,4), DOWN (8,2), LEFT (7,3), RIGHT (9,3).\n*   The apple at (6,3) is my immediate target. Snake #0 is at (8,3), two cells to the right on the same row. They could move LEFT to (7,3), which is adjacent to my target (6,3). If they move LEFT this turn, they will be at (7,3) next to the apple. If I move DOWN to (6,3) and eat the apple, I will be at (6,3) and they could potentially move LEFT again into my head on the next turn if I stay, but moves are simultaneous. The risk is a future head-on collision if we both target the same cell.\n*   However, moving DOWN to eat the apple now is the most direct way to score. I need to assess if moving DOWN risks a head-on collision *this turn*. Could Snake #0 move into (6,3) this turn? No, they are at (8,3) and can only move one cell. They cannot reach (6,3) this turn. Therefore, moving DOWN to eat the apple is safe from immediate collision with Snake #0's head.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate strategic value of moves.**\n\n*   **DOWN (6,3)**: Eats the nearest apple, gains a point, and grows. This is highly advantageous. It puts my head at (6,3), with Snake #0 potentially at (7,3) if they move LEFT. I would need to plan an escape route for next turn (likely UP to (6,4) or LEFT to (5,3)).\n*   **LEFT (5,4)**: Moves away from the enemy and the apple cluster. Not optimal for scoring.\n*   **UP (6,5)**: Moves away from the y=3 apple cluster.

The move DOWN to (6,3) is safe, gains a point, and grows my snake. The potential future adjacency to Snake #0 is a manageable risk for the next turn, given the reward.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:** After eating the apple at (6,3), my snake will have a body segment. I must avoid moving backwards into my new tail. My head will be at (6,3), and my tail will be at (6,4) (my previous head position). Therefore, moving UP back to (6,4) next turn would be moving into my own body and would kill me. I must plan to move LEFT to (5,3), RIGHT to (7,3), or DOWN to (6,2) (if safe). I will need to check Snake #0's new position and choose the safest escape from the apple cell, preferably towards another apple ((4,3) or (3,3)).\n\nDOWN",

Reduces distance to (4,3) to 2 and (3,3) to 3.\n\nAll moves keep 3-4 follow-up options open (board sparse), but LEFT best positions for row 3 apple cluster (two apples adjacent at (3,3)/(4,3) for rapid growth to length 2-3). Enemy likely contests row 3 (closer), but simultaneous LEFT pressures it\u2014 if enemy LEFTs to (5,3), I trail safely; if RIGHTs to (7,3), I claim (6,3) unhindered; other moves leave path clear. Avoid RIGHT (retreats). UP/DOWN detour unneeded yet, but viable later for (4,7).\n\n**Long-term plan:** LEFT to (6,3), press row 3. Next: LEFT to (5,3) if clear toward (4,3), or UP/DOWN if enemy trails/blocks (e.g., enemy RIGHT swap lets me chain LEFTs). Eat (4,3) or (3,3) ASAP for length 2; then flank enemy tail or pivot to (4,7). Monitor enemy body trail post-move (vacates (6,4)); use open right/south space to dodge traps. Goal: match enemy apples quickly, then outmaneuver with growth.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "**Analysis of Turn 3:**\n\nMy snake (ID 1) is now at head (6,3). My body is [(6,4)] (one segment behind me). I just ate the apple at (6,3) last turn, so my snake will grow by one segment after this move. That means after I move, my tail will stay where it is (6,4), and a new body segment will appear at my old head position (6,3). Effectively, my body next turn will be: [new head, (6,3), (6,4)].\n\nSnake #0 is at head (7,3). They have no body. Apples are at (4,7), (3,3), (4,3), (2,9), (1,9).\n\n**Step 1: Evaluate possible moves for immediate safety.**\n\n*   **UP to (6,4)**: This cell currently contains my tail 'T'. Moving into my own body kills me. **ELIMINATED.**\n*   **DOWN to (6,2)**: Empty cell. Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (5,3)**: Empty cell. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (7,3)**: This cell contains Snake #0's head. Moving into another snake's head causes a head-on collision if they also move into that cell or stay. Since moves are simultaneous, this is risky and could kill us both. I should avoid moving into an occupied head cell unless I'm certain they will leave. **ELIMINATED** as too dangerous.\n\nRemaining safe moves: DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy movement and future safety.**\n\nSnake #0 at (7,3) has safe moves: UP (7,4), DOWN (7,2), LEFT (6,3), RIGHT (8,3).\n*   They could move LEFT into (6,3), which is my current position. If I move LEFT to (5,3) or DOWN to (6,2), I vacate (6,3), making it safe for them to enter. If I stay in place (not an option), we would collide.\n*   The dangerous scenario is if they move LEFT to (6,3) and I move RIGHT to (7,3) \u2014 that's the head-on collision we already eliminated.\n*   Since I am not moving RIGHT, the main risk is if they move DOWN to (7,2) while I move DOWN to (6,2). That would put our heads adjacent diagonally, not a collision this turn.\n*   If they move LEFT to (6,3), they will eat the apple that was just generated there? Wait, I just ate the apple at (6,3). The board shows my head '1' at (6,3). There is no apple there now. So if they move LEFT to (6,3), they move into my current cell, which is empty. That would be a head-on collision only if I were still there, but I will have moved.\n\nTherefore, both DOWN and LEFT seem safe from immediate collision.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate strategic value of moves.**\n\nApples: (4,3) and (3,3) are close on row y=3. (4,7) is up and left. (2,9) and (1,9) are far top-left.\n*   **LEFT to (5,3)**: Moves me closer to the apple cluster at (4,3) and (3,3). From (5,3), my next moves could be LEFT to (4,3) to eat, or DOWN/UP. This is a direct path toward scoring.\n*   **DOWN to (6,2)**: Moves me away from the y=3 apples and the enemy. From (6,2), I could go LEFT to (5,2) to approach the apples, but it's less direct. This move feels more defensive, putting distance between me and Snake #0.\n\nGiven my lead (1 apple vs 0), a conservative move is reasonable, but actively pursuing apples is how I extend my lead. Moving LEFT seems more aggressive and goal-oriented.\n\n**Step 4: Check future mobility after each safe move.**\n\n*   If I move **LEFT to (5,3)**:\n    *   My new body will be: head (5,3), then (6,3), then (6,4).\n    *   Next turn, from (5,3), I cannot move RIGHT back to (6,3) because that's my body. My safe moves would be UP (5,4), DOWN (5,2), LEFT (4,3). That's three options, good mobility. LEFT goes directly to apple (4,3).\n*   If I move **DOWN to (6,2)**:\n    *   My new body: head (6,2), (6,3), (6,4).\n    *   Next turn, from (6,2), I cannot move UP back to (6,3). Safe moves: DOWN (6,1), LEFT (5,2), RIGHT (7,2). Also three options. This area is less crowded with apples.\n\nBoth offer similar mobility. LEFT positions me better for immediate scoring next turn.\n\n**Step 5: Consider Snake #0's likely move.**\n\nSnake #0 is at (7,3) with no apples. They will likely seek the nearest apple. The closest apples are at (4,3) and (3,3) \u2014 the same ones I'm targeting. They could move LEFT to (6,3) (empty), then next turn LEFT again to (5,3) or DOWN, etc., to approach. If I move LEFT to (5,3), I get a head start toward those apples. If I move DOWN, I cede that path to them.\n\n**Decision:** Moving LEFT to (5,3) is safe, increases my proximity to the nearest apples, maintains good mobility, and is a proactive scoring move. It also slightly distances my head from Snake #0's head (from adjacent to two cells apart diagonally).\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:** From (5,3), assess if moving LEFT to (4,3) to eat the apple is safe (check Snake #0's new position). If safe, take it. If not, consider DOWN to (5,2) or UP to (5,4) to reposition. Continue to monitor Snake #0's path toward the apple cluster.\n\nLEFT",
