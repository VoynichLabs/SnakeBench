It cannot reach (0,\u202f1) in a single turn, so a head\u2011on collision is impossible. Moving UP to (1,\u202f2) would be risky because the enemy could move DOWN into that same cell and kill both of us. Moving DOWN to (1,\u202f0) is also safe, but it pushes me onto the bottom row where my only safe follow\u2011up would be LEFT to (0,\u202f0) \u2013 a move that would immediately place me against the board edge with limited options thereafter.  \n\nFrom (0,\u202f1) I retain two viable continuations: UP to (0,\u202f2) or DOWN to (0,\u202f0) where an apple sits.

It moves me upward toward the nearest apples (5,6) and (5,9), keeping my x\u2011coordinate at 5 where those apples lie.\n\n**Future options**\nMoving UP leaves me with three viable next moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) after the shift, whereas moving RIGHT would place me next to the edge of my current body segment and limit immediate horizontal flexibility. UP also keeps me in the same column as the two highest\u2011value apples, giving me a clear vertical path while avoiding any imminent head\u2011on collision with snake\u202f#1 (its head is far up at y=7).\n\n**Plan for the next few turns**\n1.

Keep an eye on snake\u202f#1\u2019s position; if it starts moving upward toward (3,9), I can adjust horizontally to stay clear.\n\nGiven the above, the safest and most promising move is **UP**.  \nUP",

Moving UP will eat it, increasing my apple count to 10 and lengthening the snake.\n\n- **Future options**: After eating the apple, my new head will be at (5,5).
