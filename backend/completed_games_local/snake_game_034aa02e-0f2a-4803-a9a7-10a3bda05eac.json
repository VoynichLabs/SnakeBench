Secures tie (5 apples), positions south-center for next (e.g., (1,7) if uneaten ~11 steps post-eat, or block enemy). LEFT viable alt for (1,7) (less contested, arrive t31 pre-enemy ~t34 post-mid), but longer path/lower priority vs (7,2). Avoids trapping (row7/8 open post-move). Future options: post-eat, RIGHT along row2 (empty col8-9) or LEFT if (1,7) avail.\n\n### Next Plan\nt23 DOWN (9,7) len5 [(9,7)h,(9,8),(9,9),(8,9),(7,9)]t drops (7,8). t24 LEFT (8,7) empty len5 [(8,7)h,(9,7),(9,8),(9,9),(8,9)]t drops (7,9). t25 LEFT (7,7) empty len5 [(7,7)h,(8,7),(9,7),(9,8),(9,9)]t drops (8,9). t26-30 DOWN to (7,6)-(7,5)-(7,4)-(7,3)-(7,2)A eat len6 [(7,2)h,(7,3),(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(7,7)]t. Monitor enemy post-mid eats: if veers south to (7,2) early (~t29), pivot t28+ LEFT from (7,4) to row4 col6 . then south/right. If (5,4)/(4,3) uneaten (unlikely), adjust to intercept post-(7,2). Post-eat, probe LEFT row2 toward (1,7) if avail/uncontested (~t32-42), or RIGHT to open east/south vs enemy growth. Target 6-7 apples by t40, use space to encircle/trap if enemy overextends mid.\n\nDOWN",

Likely DOWN (4,2) to maneuver east (t29 RIGHT (5,2), t30 (6,2), t31 (7,2)\u2014but I ate t30, head away t31 e.g. DOWN (7,1); if they arrive t31, (7,2) my body unless tailed). If enemy skips (4,3) via RIGHT t26 (6,4), monitor t27: if RIGHT (7,4), t28 pivot my LEFT to (6,4) empty or UP (7,5) loop back south; from (7,4) t28 they block (7,3+)? Adjust t28 to LEFT (6,4) if enemy east-trail spotted, else continue. Post-t30 eat, if (4,3)A taken, target (1,7)A via LEFT row2 col6-1 (~6 steps t36) or (0,8)A north (~8 steps); if (4,3) free, RIGHT-DOWN to (6,3)-(4,3) ~4 steps t34. Use len6 to patrol col6-8 row3-5 block enemy east if pursues. Aim 6th apple t30, 7th t35-40; force enemy detours west.\n\nDOWN",

No overlap with own body (tail NE at (9,8), shifting post-move but not to (7,5)), enemy (currently SW, head (5,3); even if RIGHT to (6,3), still distant from col7 row5). Follow-ups: Further DOWN open (row4-2 col7 all . except (7,2)A target), LEFT/RIGHT to row5 col6/8 empty.\n- **LEFT** to (6,6): Empty (row6 col6 .). Safe. Allows west to (4,3)A (~5 steps) or south via col6, but longer to (7,2)A (~5 steps post-move vs 3 direct).\n- **RIGHT** to (8,6): Empty (row6 col8 .). Safe. Heads east, away from (7,2)A (~6 steps south loop); risks narrowing options if enemy expands east post-eat.\n\nThree safe moves. Enemy head (5,3): Likely LEFT to (4,3)A eat len9 (optimal, 1-step gain to maintain lead; board shows A there, adjacent). Alternatives: DOWN (5,2 .) towards south but skips easy apple; RIGHT (6,3 .) east vague (~5 steps to (7,2)A but contested); UP own body suicide. Post-eat, enemy head (4,3), body fills LEFT-DOWN (e.g., t28 likely DOWN to (4,2 .) to loop east/south, avoiding own extension at (5,3)). No collision risk: Enemy max RIGHT-RIGHT t27-t28 to (7,3) unlikely (delays apple, exposes to my south advance). My tail will shed (9,8) post-move, freeing NE without issue.\n\n### Strategic Choice\nDOWN progresses to (7,2)A (3 steps: t28 (7,4), t29 (7,3), t30 eat len6 vs enemy 8-9), uncontested corridor (col7 row5-3 empty; enemy post-eat ~6+ steps via south loop around own body to reach (7,2) t31+). Avoids LEFT (west toward enemy core post-eat at (4,3)) or RIGHT (east detour cedes south apple). Post-t30 eat, options: Continue DOWN (7,1 .) t31 safe, then pivot LEFT row1 col6-4 to (4,3)A if uneaten (~5 steps t36) or north via row2 col7-1 to (1,7)A (~6 steps t36). If enemy skips (4,3) (low prob, e.g., RIGHT t27 to (6,3)), monitor: From (7,4) t28, if enemy at (6,3) threatening (7,3), adjust LEFT to (6,4 .) t28 instead. Len5-6 allows central patrol row4-6 col6-8 to block east incursion. Targets: 5th apple t30 (closes to 5-8), 6th t35-38 (e.g., (4,3) or (1,7)); force enemy west detours.\n\n### Next Plan\nt27 DOWN (7,5) len5 [(7,5)h,(7,6),(7,7),(8,7),(9,7)]t drops (9,8). t28 DOWN (7,4) len5 [(7,4)h,(7,5),(7,6),(7,7),(8,7)]t drops (9,7). t29 DOWN (7,3) len5 [(7,3)h,(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(7,7)]t drops (8,7). t30 DOWN (7,2)A eat len6 [(7,2)h,(7,3),(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(7,7)] no drop.

Follow-ups: DOWN to (7,2)A next turn (t30 eat len6), then flexible (e.g., LEFT toward (5,1)A if uneaten ~3 steps, or UP col7 corridor to (1,7)A ~5 steps).\n- **LEFT** to (6,4): Empty (row4 col6 .). Safe. Positions west but enters contested zone near enemy body (row4 col0-5 occupied); risks future clash if enemy RIGHT to (5,2) then expands south/east, or blocks my south push. Follow-ups limited: DOWN to (6,3 .) then (6,2 .) detours from (7,2)A (adds ~2 steps), crowds enemy path to (5,1)A.\n- **RIGHT** to (8,4): Empty (row4 col8 .). Safe. Clears east but away from nearest apple (7,2)A\u2014requires DOWN then LEFT loop (~4 steps vs 2 direct DOWN). Exposes south center; enemy uncontested to (5,1)/(7,2) if I delay.\n\nThree safe moves. Enemy head (4,2): Cannot UP (4,3 own body). Likely RIGHT to (5,2) targeting (5,1)A (t30 DOWN eat len9, optimal 2-step path south/east) over DOWN to (4,1) (then RIGHT, same but exposes flank) or LEFT to (3,2) (west detour, suboptimal for south apples; to (5,1)A ~4+ steps). No immediate collision: Enemy stays col3-5 row1-2; my DOWN holds col7 safe. Tail drops (8,7), freeing row7 col8 irrelevant here.\n\n### Strategic Choice\nDOWN progresses to (7,2)A (t30 eat len6, tying enemy south gain at len9 apples5). Uncontested: Col7 row3-2 empty; enemy min 3 steps to (7,2) (RIGHT x3 from (4,2) t28-30, arrives post-eat but I'd hold/grow). Avoids LEFT (invades enemy zone, risks trap near their len9 body row2-4 col0-5; they could RIGHT-DOWN claim (5,1) then pivot NE blocking col6 row2-3) or RIGHT (yields (7,2)A, forces 4+ step detour; enemy claims both south apples t30, pulls ahead 10-5). Post-t30 at (7,2) len6: If enemy takes (5,1) (high prob), pivot UP col7 (rows3-7 empty post-shift) to (1,7)A t35 (~5 steps: t31-35 UP, eat at col1 row7 via LEFT at row7 if clear). Col7 acts as spine for north push; len6 deters enemy east incursion. If enemy detours LEFT t29 (low prob), snag (5,1) from (7,2) t31 LEFT (6,2 .) t32 DOWN (6,1 .) t33 RIGHT (5,1) if open\u2014monitor but default north to pressure their west (0,8)A.\n\n### Next Plan\nt29 DOWN (7,3) len5 [(7,3)h,(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(7,7)]t drops (8,7). t30 DOWN (7,2)A eat len6 [(7,2)h,(7,3),(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(7,7)] no drop. Enemy t29 likely RIGHT (5,2) toward (5,1)A [t30 DOWN eat len9]. Post-eat, assume (5,1) taken: t31 UP (7,3) start north col7 spine (safe, empty rows3-7 col7); t32-35 UP to (7,7) then LEFT across row7 (col6-2 empty) to (1,7)A eat len7 t35, contesting their potential north loop. If (5,1) uneaten (enemy LEFT/DOWN alt), t31 LEFT (6,2 .) toward it ~t33 eat len7, then north. Use len6-7 to patrol col5-7 row2-7, boxing enemy east from south apples; aim (1,7)A or (0,8)A t35-37 for parity push (apples6-7 vs their10).\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT/DOWN suboptimal for enemy (south/east detour, delays north apples).\n\n### Strategic Choice\nUP to (6,3) advances north toward (1,7)A, (0,8)A, (3,9)A cluster (3 apples, ~10 turns to eat all, reach 8 total).

If enemy UP, dies immediately (hits (6,2) neck), I win at 5 vs 9 (but sole survivor). If enemy RIGHT (7,1), I outpace north (enemy needs 15+ turns east loop to (3,9)A via col9 up); if DOWN (6,0), enemy trapped south (row0 dead-end, loops risk vs my growth). DOWN/LEFT waste turns (south apples (0,2/3) low-value, 1-2 pts, blocked by enemy west body at col4-5 rows1-4; LEFT risks next UP into persistent enemy (5,3)). UP keeps 3+ safe follow-ups (UP north clear col6 rows3-7 empty; LEFT later at row7; RIGHT east patrol; DOWN retreat viable).

Enemy likely LEFT to (4,0) (only safe move: UP suicide on own body, RIGHT on own, DOWN off-board), remains south (rows 0-2), no threat to (6,9) this turn.\n- **DOWN** to (6,7): Own body overlap post-shift (new head (6,7) conflicts with shifting B2 from (6,6) to (6,7); simulation: new positions include duplicate (6,7)).

Post-move: head (0,1), body [(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0),(4,0),(5,0),(6,0),(7,0),(8,0)]; tail (8,1) frees, length 10. Next (t44): likely UP (0,2)A eat len11, then (0,3)A t45 len12, (0,4)t46 etc. up col0. Trajectory clear of my path (dists 8+); hits (0,2)/(0,3) before I reach (0,8), but no collision risk\u2014my LEFT chain secures (0,8) t45 independently.\n\n### Strategic Choice\nFollow plan: LEFT t43 to (2,8) len7. Enables t44 LEFT (1,8), t45 LEFT (0,8)A len8 (body [(0,8),(1,8),(2,8),(3,8),(3,9),(4,9),(5,9),(6,9)] tail drops (6,8)). t46 DOWN (0,7) len8 (drop (6,9)), t47 RIGHT (1,7)A len9 (body [(1,7),(0,7),(0,8),(1,8),(2,8),(3,8),(3,9),(4,9),(5,9)] drop (5,9)).

If enemy RIGHT at (0,5)t47 toward (9,5)A, I intercept post-eat: from (1,7)t47, RIGHT (2,7)t48/(3,7)t49/(4,7)t50 to patrol row7 cols3-9, reach (9,5) ~t55 (dist 8) vs. enemy ~t57 (dist 10 from (0,5)). Post-t47, dominate NW quadrant; t48-50 loop (1,8)-(2,8)-(2,7)-(1,7) for spawns (expect 1 t48-50 in cols0-2 rows7-9, +1 to len10). If enemy reaches row7 t49 early (deviates RIGHT t46 from (0,4) to (1,4)), block with DOWN (1,7)t47? No, RIGHT as planned traps it. Target 12 by t55 (4 eats: (0,8),(1,7),(0,2? contested),(9,5) or spawns); overtake enemy ~13 by t70 via blocks/spawns. South clear for t60+ if needed. Minimal spawn risk (open board).\n\nLEFT",

Eats to 7 apples. Positions me for (0,7) follow-up to (1,7)A.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,8): Own body. Collision. Invalid.\n\nAll except RIGHT safe. No immediate enemy head overlap (their possible to (0,3),(1,2),(0,1)\u2014none hit my targets).\n\n### Enemy Prediction\nHead (0,2): Likely UP to (0,3)A (eats len11, body shifts up col0, tail (8,0) stays/grows). Alternatives: RIGHT (1,2) empty (len10, suboptimal vs apple); DOWN (0,1) own body invalid; LEFT off-board. Post-eat t45: head (0,3), body col0 up to row3, long tail row0. t46 UP (0,4) len11 no drop, etc., reaching (0,7) ~t49. No threat to my (0,8) or (1,7) this turn (dist 5+). If deviates RIGHT t45 to (1,2), then toward (9,5)A? But slow (dist ~10), gives me time post-dual-eat to intercept mid-board.\n\n### Strategic Choice\nFollow plan: LEFT t45 to (0,8)A len8 (7 apples). Secures northern apple uncontested. t46: DOWN (0,7) empty len8 drop (6,9). t47: RIGHT (1,7)A len9 (8 apples) [body secures col0-1 row7-8]. Enemy at (0,5)t47\u2014no overlap (my (0,7) t46 drops? No, persists as prior growth offsets). Post-t47: patrol cycle (1,7)-(1,8)-(0,8)-(0,7) for spawns (expect +2-3 len11-12 by t50); block enemy at (0,7)t49 by staying/looping. If enemy RIGHT-veers, from (1,7)t47 go RIGHT (2,7)t48 empty, east to row7 col3-5 t49-50, cut off at col5 row5 ~t52 (my len9 mobile vs their len12 stretched). Ignore (0,3)A (theirs). Target (9,5)/(9,4)A post-t55 if enemy commits south-east; else farm north spawns to 15+ by t60, use space advantage (mobile vs their line) to trap/force errors by t100. Win via apples (project 25-30 vs their 20-25) or survival.\n\nLEFT",

Length 12, no growth; tail moves from (6,0) to follow path. LEFT (0,4) possible but hits own potential future positions or deviates. RIGHT (2,4) opens east but suboptimal vs direct north. DOWN invalid (own body). Low threat now; by t49 ~ (1,6), t50 (1,7)\u2014but (1,7) becomes my body if I go RIGHT, trapping them or forcing deviation (e.g., to col2, where I can intercept later).\n\n### Strategic Choice\nRIGHT to (2,7), advancing toward (5,8)A (dist 3 right +1 up). Builds on prior path: uncoils body from top-right, freeing (4,9)/(5,9) early; enables t49 RIGHT (3,7 empty), t50 RIGHT (4,7 empty), t51 RIGHT (5,7 empty), t52 UP (5,8) eat for 9 apples. Post-eat, length 10, pursue (8,8)A right along row8 (6,8)-(7,8)-(8,8) ~t55 for 10 apples, then south to (9,5/4,5) cluster. DOWN risks south trap near enemy tail (rows 0-3 occupied), limits options, delays eats. RIGHT keeps col1-(1,7) as body block vs enemy ascent, potentially starves them (11 apples max projection if detoured south/east). Win path: 15+ apples by t60 via mobility, vs enemy 13-15 (blocked north).\n\n### Short-term Plan\nt48 RIGHT (2,7). t49 RIGHT (3,7) if safe/empty. t50-51 continue RIGHT to (5,7), avoid enemy if they veer right. t52 UP eat (5,8). Monitor enemy: if they hit my (1,7) body t50, they die, instant win. Post-eat, RIGHT to (8,8). If enemy RIGHT now to (2,4), prepare intercept at (2,5-7) with growing length.\n\nRIGHT",

Length 12, no growth; tail shifts from (5,0) to (6,0)? Wait, body ends at (5,0), so tail moves to follow, freeing (5,0). DOWN invalid (own (1,4)). LEFT to (0,5) empty but deviates south/west unnecessarily (enemy's south tail heavy). RIGHT to (2,5) empty, opens east but longer to apples (e.g., (5,8) dist 5+ vs 4 UP). Predict UP (1,6); next turn UP to (1,7)\u2014but (1,7) remains my body (both moves keep it occupied), so enemy self-kills on t50, winning me the game (my 8 > their 11? No, but they die, I win if alive). If RIGHT (2,5), they avoid trap but enter my potential path east; I can block/encircle with growth.\n\n### Strategic Choice\nRIGHT to (3,7), advancing east to (5,8)A (dist 2 right +1 up). Aligns with plan: uncoils top, frees (3,9)/(4,9) soon; t50 RIGHT (4,7 empty), t51 RIGHT (5,7 empty), t52 UP eat (5,8) for 9 apples (grow to 10). Post-eat, RIGHT along row8 to (8,8)A (~t55 for 10th apple), then south to (4,5)A/(9,4-5) cluster (project 13-15 by t70). DOWN to (2,6) safe but southbound, risks enemy RIGHT into (2,5) then UP chasing me, or traps me near their tail (rows 0-4 clogged); delays apple by 3+ turns, lowers win odds (mobility edge key vs their 11). RIGHT blocks enemy north (they likely die t50), secures fast growth/east control. If they RIGHT now, t50 I RIGHT to (4,7), they to (2,6) or UP (2,6)\u2014my DOWN option opens but I avoid; use length to cut off.\n\n### Short-term Plan\nt49 RIGHT (3,7). t50 RIGHT (4,7) if empty/safe (likely, row7 clear); if enemy RIGHT to (2,5), consider UP to (3,8) but stay east. t51 RIGHT (5,7). t52 UP eat (5,8).

UP (3,6) empty but delays apple chase (to (5,8)A dist ~4, blocked by my row7 body persisting t51+). DOWN (3,4) empty but south into own tail, wasteful. LEFT invalid.

Uncoils tail (frees (3,8) now, (2,8) t52 pre-growth). UP to (4,8) also viable (alt path to (5,8) via RIGHT t52), but RIGHT prioritizes row7 control for post-eat flexibility (e.g., DOWN to row6 if needed vs enemy at (4,5)). DOWN risks south convergence (enemy post-eat at (4,5) could UP/LEFT intercept t52+). RIGHT maximizes apple speed (2 turns), traps enemy if they detour UP (my body blocks north), or races growth if they eat (I hit 9 t52, they 12 t51\u2014but my agility > their 13-length bulk; target (8,8)A t54 for 10th).\n\n### Short-term Plan\nt51 RIGHT (5,7). t52 UP eat (5,8), grow. t53 RIGHT (6,8 empty) to (8,8)A. t54 eat (8,8) to 10/grow 11. Then east to (9,8) loop DOWN for (9,5)/(9,4) by t57 (12th). If enemy eats (4,5)/heads east, contest row5-6 post-my eats (use freed NW space for maneuvers). Fallback: if RIGHT/UP unsafe t52, LEFT/DOWN to (4,7)/(5,6) evade. Prioritize east apples; avoid south until enemy commits.\n\nRIGHT",

UP maximizes growth speed/agility edge (my length 10 vs. their 13 post-t56 eat; shorter allows faster chases/loops). Frees tail progressively on row 8 for evasion if needed.\n\n### Short-term Plan\nt52 UP eat (5,8), grow to 10 len. t53 RIGHT (6,8 empty). t54 RIGHT (7,8 empty). t55 RIGHT eat (8,8) to 11 len. t56+ east/DOWN for (9,5)/(9,4) by t58 (12th).

UP positions awkwardly north (row 9 detour to (8,8) via RIGHTs then DOWN, wastes turns). LEFT reverses east momentum, coils west into own space, risks trapping.

My shorter length aids agility for southeast push post-eat.\n\n### Short-term Plan\nt53 RIGHT (6,8). t54 RIGHT (7,8 empty). t55 RIGHT eat (8,8) to 10 apples/len 11. t56 DOWN (8,7 empty) or RIGHT (9,8 empty) toward (9,4)A (path: from (8,8) DOWN (8,7)-RIGHT (9,7)-DOWN (9,6)-DOWN (9,5? but apple gone)-DOWN (9,4) by t59).

Enables quick access to empty row6 for west maneuvers toward SW apples post-enemy SE run (uncoil tail for crossing row5 ~t65). RIGHT risks eastern trap (next only DOWN viable, limited pivots); UP heads to barren top (2 options next, inefficient for south apples). DOWN maintains flexibility, avoids cramping coil, positions to trail/contest enemy post-(9,1) or exploit respawns.\n\n### Short-term Plan\nt56 DOWN (8,7). t57 LEFT (7,7). t58 LEFT (6,7). t59 DOWN (6,6). t60 LEFT (5,6); continue LEFT row6 to ~col3 by t63 for (3,6). t64 UP/DOWN wait if needed. t65 DOWN (3,5) when free; south to intercept (3,0) ~t69+ if enemy prioritizes (2,1). If enemy deviates, pivot RIGHT row6 or UP to row7. Survive to respawns; use len11 vs 14 for turns.\n\nDOWN",

Safe: no growth, new head (5,6); vacates tail (3,7); no self-collision (body shifts east on row 7, loop row 8 intact); no enemy overlap (enemy likely DOWN to (9,1) eat apple, far east; no probe to col 5 row 6).\n- **RIGHT** to (7,6): Empty. Safe: similar, new head (7,6); vacates (3,7); no collisions, but extends away from target apple.\n\nTwo safe moves. No head-on risk (enemy targets (9,1)).\n\n### Enemy Prediction\nHead (9,2): DOWN to (9,1) eat apple (direct, optimal for growth to 15; empty cell). Avoids UP own body (9,3), RIGHT off-board, LEFT (8,2) suboptimal (detour). Post-eat: head (9,1), grows (adds segment, tail (0,3) stays); likely LEFT to (8,1) next (row 1 clear cols 0-8 post-eat), pursuing west but slowed by length/row 5 block. Vacates nothing immediately impactful; row 3 col 0 stays occupied longer.\n\n### Strategic Choice\nLEFT to (5,6): Advances plan toward (0,6) apple (5 moves away post-this, eat t65 grow to 11). Row 6 corridor remains open (no enemy reach soon). RIGHT diverts east into dead-end vs. own loop, risks trapping if enemy snakes west faster. We prioritize SW control: uncoil frees row 7 col 3 west; post-(0,6) eat, south to col 0 row 0 for (3,0)/(6,0) intercepts (t70ish). Enemy post-(9,1) trails east-to-west on row 1, hits row 5 wall ~t65-70; we gain 1 apple lead, block south escape. If enemy probes col 0 row 5 early, our col 0 position contests respawns.\n\n### Short-term Plan\nt60 LEFT (5,6). t61-65 LEFT x5 to (0,6) eat #11, grow len 12. t66-70 DOWN x5 to (0,1). t71+ east on row 1/0 to (3,0)/(6,0) per availability; if enemy clears row 5 col 0-2 t65+, drop south via col 1 row 5. Aim 12-13 by t75, use agility vs. enemy length for blocks. Pivot if north apples spawn row 7-8.\n\nLEFT",

UP to (3,7) safe but adds 2-3 turns to apple, tightens space near own row 7/8 body; risks if enemy unexpectedly north. Prioritize efficient apple path; enemy focused bottom, leaves top-left free.\n\n### Short-term Plan\nt63 LEFT (2,6). t64 LEFT (1,6). t65 LEFT (0,6) eat #11, len 12. t66 DOWN (0,5) (empty). t67-71 DOWN x5 to (0,0) [adjust: actually t66 (0,5), t67 (0,4), t68 (0,3), t69 (0,2), t70 (0,1), t71 (0,0)]. t72+ RIGHT along row 1 for (2,1)/(4,1) apples (#12-13); monitor enemy post-(6,0) eat (t65), if it turns north avoid row 0/1 cols 3+ by staying left or UP pivot if apples spawn col 0.

UP to (7,1) possible (empty) but suboptimal vs. immediate apple; RIGHT own body (8,0), DOWN off-board.

UP safe but loops me near own row 7/8 body, delays apple by 2 turns, risks tighter space if enemy pivots unexpectedly north long-term.

UP to (6,1) empty possible (toward (4,1)/(2,1) apples in row 1, ~4-5 turns via row 1), but direct LEFT prioritizes closer (3,0). RIGHT own body (7,0), DOWN off-board. Enemy length 17 pins right/center; min 10+ turns to threaten col 0 north/south. No risk to my left descent this turn.\n\n### Strategic Choice\nLEFT to (0,6): Eats #11 immediately (len 12), secures top-left before potential enemy pivot. Path clear down col 0 to (0,1) apple (#12 in 5 turns). UP safe but wastes turn, loops toward own row 7/8 body (tightens options, delays south apples 3+ turns). Enemy row 0/1-focused; claim (0,1)/(2,1) now, block enemy expansion left.\n\n### Short-term Plan\nt65 LEFT (0,6) eat #11, len 12. t66-70 DOWN x5 to (0,1) eat #12 (col 0 empty). t71 RIGHT (1,1) empty. t72 RIGHT (2,1) eat #13. Then RIGHT/UP for (3,0)/(4,1) if free pre-enemy, else loop west row 1-2. Monitor enemy row 0 push; if blocks (3,0), target (4,1) via row 1 east. New apples? Prioritize safe south/center.\n\nLEFT",

Only 1 viable (backtrack); traps in corner with enemy nearby\u2014high risk of death next turn.\n- **LEFT** to (0,1): Own body (direct back). Death.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,1): Current enemy head (position remains enemy body post-move, as neck shifts into it). Death.\n\nSafe: UP, DOWN. UP optimal\u2014maximizes mobility (3 options vs 1), avoids dead-end, positions for east/north toward apples (e.g., skirt to col 6). DOWN unnecessary risk; 78 turns left, prioritize expansion over south isolation.\n\n### Enemy Prediction\nHead at (2,1), no apple. Back DOWN own body\u2014suicide, unlikely. LEFT to (1,1) risky (my current head; potential head-on if I DOWN/LEFT, but I won't). Likely UP (2,2) empty (opens row 2 east to (5,3) A path) or RIGHT (3,1) empty (but then next limited to UP (3,2); suboptimal trap). Post-move, enemy can't reach (1,2) this turn (no direction leads there). Low collision risk; enemy focused south-center, my UP path evades via col 1.\n\n### Strategic Choice\nUP aligns with prior plan: secures row 2 access, evades enemy head (whether to (2,2) or (3,1)). DOWN closes options prematurely. Enemy at 20; target growth via safe path to (6,8) (#13) or (5,3) if uncontested. Board open mid: 4 apples, my length 13 allows maneuvering around enemy row 5 tail.\n\n### Short-term Plan\nt72 UP (1,2). t73: If enemy to (2,2), UP (1,3) then RIGHT (2,3) empty; else RIGHT (2,2). t74 RIGHT (3,2/3) east row 2-3 (empties). t75-76: To col 5-6 row 3-4, UP skirt to (6,8) A (row 6 tail vacates by t76-77).

Follow-ups: UP (1,5) empty, RIGHT (2,4) empty unless enemy UP (predicted 60%, blocks as new enemy head remains occupied by neck), DOWN own body (1,3) post-move, LEFT own body (0,4). Viable options 1-2; advances to open row 4/5 east/north.\n- **DOWN** to (1,2): Own body (neck). Death (backwards).\n- **LEFT** to (0,3): Own body. Death.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,3): Enemy head position (remains occupied post-move by enemy neck). Death.\n\nSafe: Only UP. Preserves mobility in open mid-board; no suicide alternatives.\n\n### Enemy Prediction\nHead (2,3), no apple nearby. DOWN (2,2) own body, LEFT (1,3) my head (collides with my new neck post-move)\u2014suicide. Likely UP (2,4) empty (north trend continuation, 60%; positions for detour to north apples or evade) or RIGHT (3,3) empty (40%; direct to (5,3) A in 3 moves). Neither hits my (1,4). Post-move, enemy likely occupies col2 row4 or col3 row3, but my col1 row4 evades; long body blocks south but north open.\n\n### Strategic Choice\nUP accesses row4 open east (col1-8 empty) for pivot to (4,9) A (Manhattan 8, clear path col4 up) while north to (5,9). Enemy favors (5,3) if RIGHT, freeing north; if UP, contests mid but my shorter length (13 vs 21) skirts via row5 right. 76 turns left; aim 3-4 apples (target 16-18 by t100) via north cluster. Avoid south trap near enemy flank; monitor for loop north if contested.\n\n### Short-term Plan\nt74 UP (1,4). t75: RIGHT (2,4) if empty (enemy RIGHT case, fast east to (4,4) then up col4 to (4,9) A t82). If enemy UP blocks (2,4), UP (1,5) then t76 RIGHT (2,5) (enemy likely RIGHT from (2,4) to east/south A, vacating; else up unsafe but assess). t77-78 RIGHT (3,5)-(4,5). t79 UP (4,6) vacated. t80-82 UP (4,7)-(4,8)-(4,9) A. If south apple free (enemy north), pivot east sooner to (5,3) detour but low priority.\n\nUP",

If UP, both reach apples t82 as planned; if RIGHT, col4 unblocked.\n\n### Strategic Choice\nRIGHT executes plan: secures col4 north (7-turn apple pace viable for catch-up, targeting 17 total by t90). Enemy north contest mutual but parallel safe; my shorter length evades tail traps easier. Avoid UP\u2014col3 north open but RIGHT detour to (4,9) risks t83 enemy head at (5,4) blocking flank.

Direct path to two apples in 3 turns total.\n- **DOWN** to (4,6): Own neck. Death.\n- **LEFT** to (3,7): Empty (row7 col3 .). Safe, but my body crowds col3 row4 (3,4), limiting escapes west/south. Follow-ups: UP (3,8) empty, but to apples requires 4+ turns east (e.g., RIGHT x2 to col5, UP x2), missing (4,9) window.\n- **RIGHT** to (5,7): Empty (row7 col5 .). Safe. Follow-ups: UP x2 to (5,9)A t83 (rows8-9 col5 clear). Or RIGHT/UP to (6,8)A in 3 turns. Viable but slower than UP (gets one apple t83 vs two by t83 via UP).\n\nSafe: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. UP optimal for quickest apples ((4,9) then (5,9)), no enemy contest (they're col7+ trajectory).\n\n### Enemy Prediction\nHead (7,5).

Can't reach my north path (min 2 cols away + moves); simultaneous, no head-on risk. If RIGHT, frees col7 slightly but irrelevant to my col4-5.\n\n### Strategic Choice\nUP secures (4,9)A t82 (13th apple, len14), RIGHT to (5,9)A t83 (14th, len15) uncontested. Enemy eats (7,7) t82, growing to len23, but isolates east (col6 buffer prevents pursuit). RIGHT now delays first apple by 1 turn, risks (4,9) if enemy somehow pivots (low prob). LEFT inefficient, traps in my western body cluster. 69 turns left; north path ~0.2 apples/turn potential (8+ more viable), narrows gap safely. Post-(5,9), target (6,8)A t85 via RIGHT x2/DOWN (col6 rows9-8 clear).\n\n### Short-term Plan\nt81 UP (4,8). t82 UP (4,9)A eat (13th). t83 RIGHT (5,9)A eat (14th) if avail (else UP edge safe or LEFT (4,9) hold). t84 RIGHT (6,9) empty toward (6,8)A. t85 DOWN (6,8)A (15th). Then (9,6)A via east/south if enemy takes (7,7) tail space; else skirt col8 north for loops. Monitor: if enemy RIGHT t81 to (8,5), post-(6,8) accelerate east to contest (9,6) (4 turns via (7,8)-(8,8)-(9,8)-(9,7)-(9,6)). If UP chain, unopposed (6,8) then probe (7,7) vacated area.\n\nUP",

Safe, eat 14th (grow len15). No enemy reach this turn (dist 4). Follow-ups open: RIGHT t84 (6,9). or DOWN t84 (5,8). Avoids self-trap; removes (5,9) preventing enemy chain.\n\nSafe: LEFT, RIGHT.

Avoid LEFT trap: net loss apple, higher gap. 67 turns left; target 0.4/turn (chain 2-3 short-term via (8,4)-(2,6)?), feasible catch if enemy overextends.\n\n### Short-term Plan\nt83 RIGHT (5,9)A eat (14th, head(5,9)). t84 RIGHT (6,9) empty (len15, tail shifts south). t85 RIGHT (7,9) empty. t86 RIGHT (8,9) empty. t87 DOWN (8,8) empty. t88 DOWN (8,7). t89 DOWN (8,6). t90 DOWN (8,5). t91 DOWN (8,4)A eat (15th). t92+ LEFT probe (7,4) if clear or UP skirt to (2,6) via row5-6 west (monitor enemy post-(9,6): if south (8,4) contested, detour col9 down then left).

No risks\u2014optimal.\n\n### Short-term Plan\nt86 RIGHT (8,9) empty (len15). t87 DOWN (8,8) empty. t88 DOWN (8,7) empty. t89 DOWN (8,6)A eat (15th, len16). t90 DOWN (8,5) empty. t91 DOWN (8,4)A eat (16th, len17). t92 LEFT (7,4) if empty (enemy body at (7,4)?\u2014monitor, alt DOWN (8,3) loop if blocked). Then west row4 to (2,4)-(2,6)A ~t97 (dist~5 post-clear); scout enemy west progress. If enemy DOWN t86 to (6,6), possible col7/8 south probe\u2014arrive (8,6) first t89, body deny. If LEFT, west clear for me later.\n\nRIGHT",

Viable south, but toward dense own body (rows 0-4 cols 2-7); risks trapping long length (24\u2192?).\n- LEFT (5,5): Empty (row5 col5 .). Viable west to (2,6)A (dist ~3 turns) or (0,6)A (dist ~5).\n- RIGHT (7,5): Own body. Death.\nLikely LEFT ~70% (apple pull west, avoids south jam) or DOWN ~30% (short-term space but poor long-term). If LEFT, enemy claims (2,6) t89-91 (~24 apples); my east/south uncontested ((8,6)/(9,6)/(8,4) dist ~4-6 turns for enemy via detour). No immediate threat to col8 row6-8.\n\n### Strategic Choice\nDOWN executes +3 apple chain: t88 DOWN (8,7) empty (15 seg), t89 DOWN (8,6)A eat (15th apple, len16), t90 RIGHT (9,6)A eat (16th, len17), t91 DOWN (9,5) empty (row5 col9 .), t92 LEFT (8,5) empty (row5 col8 .), t93 DOWN (8,4)A eat (17th, len18). Path clear (col8/9 rows4-7 empty post-move; no enemy overlap). Nets +3 vs. enemy's likely +1 west\u2014gap to ~6 apples. My shorter length stays agile for post-chain pivot (e.g., t94+ west row4/5 if (2,6) uneaten, dist~4-5 to (0,6)). RIGHT alternative yields +1 short-term (t90 (9,6)A), delays (8,6)/(8,4)\u2014worse efficiency, risks enemy west sweep unopposed longer. No collision risk; monitor enemy for col6 west probe.\n\n### Short-term Plan\nt88 DOWN (8,7) empty. t89 DOWN (8,6)A eat (15th, len16). t90 RIGHT (9,6)A eat (16th, len17). t91 DOWN (9,5) empty. t92 LEFT (8,5) empty. t93 DOWN (8,4)A eat (17th, len18). Post-chain, assess (2,6)/(0,6): if enemy takes (2,6), target (0,6) via row5/6 west (likely clear); if not, intercept (2,6) row4 west. Avoid col6-7 enemy; scout row3/2 for loops if needed. RIGHT only if enemy surprises east (unlikely).\n\nDOWN",

DOWN prioritized\u2014eats (8,6) immediately (+1 apple), sets up chain: t90 RIGHT to (9,6)A (+1 to 16), t91 DOWN to (9,5) empty, t92 LEFT to (8,5) empty, t93 DOWN to (8,4)A (+1 to 17). Path clear (col8-9 rows4-7 post-move empty; enemy pinned west). RIGHT skips (8,6), reaches (9,6) in 1 turn but misses chain efficiency (+1 only, delays south apple by 2+ turns).\n\n### Enemy Prediction\nHead at (6,4). Safe options limited:\n- UP (6,5): Own neck. Death.\n- DOWN (6,3): Own body. Death.\n- LEFT (5,4): Empty (row4 col5 .). Only viable\u2014west toward (2,6)A (dist ~3 turns) or (0,6)A (dist ~5).

No east/south threat (enemy body blocks col7 row4-8; detour >6 turns to my chain). My +3 chain pulls to 17 apples (gap ~6), while enemy likely +1 at (2,6) t91-92 (~24).\n\n### Strategic Choice\nExecute DOWN for chain start: +3 apples by t93 vs. enemy's +1 west. Shorter length (16 post-eat) keeps agility for post-chain (e.g., t94+ west row4-5 to (0,6) if (2,6) taken, dist ~6 clear; or intercept (2,6) row5 if slow). RIGHT suboptimal\u2014yields +2 max by t92 ((9,6) then south detour), risks enemy west dominance longer (to 25+ by t95).

Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (7,4): Enemy body (T at row 4, col 7). Death.\n- **RIGHT** to (9,4): Empty (board shows . at row 4, col 9). Safe.\n\nTwo safe options: DOWN, RIGHT. No immediate apples in either.\n\n### Enemy Prediction\nEnemy head (5,8) trapped:\n- UP (5,9): My body.\n- DOWN (5,7): Own body.\n- LEFT (4,8): My body.\n- RIGHT (6,8): Own body.\nEnemy dies this turn regardless of choice. No threat to my positions (can't reach (8,3) or (9,4)). I survive \u2192 immediate win (opponent dead, I alive).\n\n### Strategic Choice\nBoth safe, but DOWN follows prior plan (south toward (7,1) apple if needed). RIGHT viable but squeezes toward edge (next RIGHT off-board). Prioritize open path: DOWN. Win secured; future irrelevant.\n\n### Short-term Plan\nWin imminent (t94 enemy death). If game continues anomalously, DOWN to (8,3); t95 LEFT to (7,3) toward (7,1) apple; avoid north/east traps. Scout west apples (e.g., (3,2)) post-win if required.\n\nDOWN",
