My snake (ID 0) is at (1,8) with no body, and the enemy snake #1 is at (0,9) with no body, so no existing body segments to worry about. All four possible moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are on the board, and moving backwards is irrelevant with no body. However, UP and LEFT must be eliminated due to collision risk:\n- Moving UP to (1,9) risks a head-on collision if snake #1 moves RIGHT to (1,9) (which is possible for them).\n- Moving LEFT to (0,8) risks a head-on collision if snake #1 moves DOWN to (0,8) (which is also possible for them).\n\nSnake #1's only safe moves are RIGHT to (1,9) or DOWN to (0,8), so they will choose one of these. This leaves me with DOWN to (1,7) or RIGHT to (2,8), both of which are safe since snake #1 cannot reach these cells in one move.\n\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT:\n- Both have similar Manhattan distances to the nearest apple (e.g., (4,5) at distance 5 from either position).\n- Moving DOWN to (1,7) reduces my y-coordinate, which is favorable since most apples (like (4,5), (6,6), (0,1), (7,2), (9,4)) are at lower rows (apples are at rows 1-6, and I'm at row 8). This starts descending toward apple-dense areas like (4,5) and (6,6) while potentially avoiding conflicts with snake #1, who is likely to move DOWN toward (0,8) or RIGHT toward (1,9).\n- (1,7) has all follow-up moves open (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT), similar to (2,8). However, it positions me centrally for flexible paths to multiple apples in future turns.\n- Moving RIGHT to (2,8) keeps me at a higher row, which is less efficient for reaching apples quickly. It also places me closer to snake #1 if they move RIGHT, increasing future collision risk near the top edge.\n\nLong-term plan for next turns: Move toward the central apple at (4,5) or explore to (6,6) depending on the board state. Avoid the top rows near snake #1 if possible, and gradually descend to safer areas with more apples. Monitor snake #1's position to prevent head-on collisions.\n\nDOWN is the best move to keep distance from the enemy, access multiple paths, and initiate descent toward apples.\n\nDOWN",

All four moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are initially board-valid, but each must be evaluated for collision risks due to simultaneous movement:\n  - **UP to (1,8)**: High risk\u2014if snake #1 moves DOWN (to (1,8)), a head-on collision occurs (both die). Snake #1 has DOWN as one of its valid moves (with no body), so this move is unsafe and eliminated.\n  - **DOWN to (1,6)**: Safe\u2014cell is empty and on-board. Snake #1 cannot reach (1,6) in one move (it only moves to (1,8), (0,9), or (2,9)), so no collision risk.\n  - **LEFT to (0,7)**: Safe\u2014cell is empty and on-board. Snake #1 cannot reach it directly. However, it positions me on the left edge, reducing future flexibility (only UP, DOWN, and RIGHT would be available next turn, with LEFT off-board).\n  - **RIGHT to (2,7)**: Safe\u2014cell is empty and on-board. Snake #1 cannot reach it directly. Good for central positioning and multiple future moves.\n\n- **Apple Proximity Strategy**: Apples are at (9,4), (6,6), (7,2), (0,1), and (4,5). From (1,7):\n  - Key insights: Moving DOWN decreases y-coordinate, which is favorable as 4/5 apples have lower y-values (apples at rows 1-6, average row ~4.6 vs my y=7). (4,5) is closest (Manhattan dist=5), and moving DOWN reduces this to dist=4 from (1,6). Moving RIGHT also reduces dist to (4,5) to 4, but DOWN decreases y more efficiently toward multiple apples long-term (like (4,5) and (0,1)).\n  - LEFT (to (0,7)) increases dist to (4,5) to 6 and is less efficient; RIGHT (to (2,7)) keeps y stable and slightly increases x.\n\n- **Enemy Avoidance**: Snake #1 is more likely to stay near the top row for immediate apples like (6,6). Moving DOWN increases y-separation (from current \u0394y=2 to \u0394y=3), reducing future collision risk. LEFT moves horizontally away but offers no y-separation and may box me in. RIGHT is neutral but could increase x-proximity risk if snake #1 moves rightward.\n\n- **Future Flexibility**: DOWN to (1,6) enables all four moves next turn for versatility. LEFT (edge position) has only three moves. RIGHT (central) is flexible but less aligned with apple descent.\n\n- **Long-Term Plan (for next turns)**: Descend toward higher apple density areas (rows 5-1) and prioritize reaching (4,5). From (1,6), consider moving RIGHT to (2,6) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 etc. towards (4,5) if safe. Avoid approaching snake #1's territory (top row) and monitor its moves to evade head-on collisions. If multiple apples are reachable (e.g., after eating one), choose paths that preserve move options.\n\n**Conclusion**: DOWN is optimal\u2014it ensures safety, moves closer to apples (especially (4,5) via y-decrease), maintains distance from snake #1, and keeps all future moves open. RIGHT or LEFT are acceptable but less aligned with strategy.\n\nDOWN",

Increases distance to (0,1) by 1 \u2014 good for apples but slightly less efficient for (0,1).\n- **Enemy Avoidance**: Snake #1 is at (2,9) (top row). Moving DOWN to (1,5) increases vertical separation from enemy (\u0394y=4) compared to current (\u0394y=3) and RIGHT (\u0394y=3). This reduces risk of future collisions, as enemy is more likely to move horizontally (e.g., toward (6,6)) or down slowly. RIGHT to (2,6) shares the same x-column with enemy, possibly increasing risk if enemy moves down aggressively.\n- **Future Flexibility**: Both DOWN and RIGHT allow all four directions next turn. DOWN positions me at (1,5), closer to apple-dense lower rows (apples at rows 1-5). RIGHT at (2,6) is good for horizontal movement but slightly farther from lower apples like (0,1).\n- **Long-Term Plan (for next turns)**: Descend toward (4,5) \u2014 from (1,5), move RIGHT to (2,5) then (3,5) to approach (4,5).

RIGHT is viable but slightly riskier due to potential enemy convergence. UP and LEFT are inefficient.\n\nDOWN",

Positions me near the edge, reducing flexibility.\n  - RIGHT (to 2,5): Decreases distance to (4,5) to 2 (key!) and to (6,6) to 5, (7,2) to 8, and (9,4) to 8. Only increases distance to (0,1) to 6, which can be targeted later. Best for apple collection.\n- **Enemy Avoidance**: Snake #1 at (2,8) will likely move DOWN or RIGHT to approach apples like (4,5) or (6,6). Right to (2,5) maintains vertical separation (current \u0394y=3; after move, if enemy down to (2,7), \u0394y=2\u2013still safe). It also avoids converging paths; (2,5) is not on any adjacent path from enemy.\n- **Future Flexibility**: From (2,5), all four moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) will likely be open next turn, based on current board. Positions me centrally to access (4,5) next, then other apples. Avoids edges like LEFT/0,5 where one move (LEFT) would be blocked.\n- **Long-Term Plan (for turns 4+**: Aim to eat (4,5) by moving RIGHT to (3,5) next turn if safe (check enemy position first). Then grow and target the apple at (0,1) or (7,2); monitor snake #1 for movement toward apples like (6,6). Maintain vertical/ horizontal distance from enemies. If (4,5) is taken, adapt towards (6,6) or (0,1).\n\nRIGHT",

After evaluating the board:\n  - UP to (2,6): On-board, currently empty, but risky due to possible head-on collision if enemy snake #1 (at (2,7)) moves DOWN to (2,6). Low probability, but not zero; enemy may avoid this, but I should minimize risk.\n  - DOWN to (2,4): On-board, currently empty. No collision risk with enemy; enemy cannot reach (2,4) in one move (from (2,7), enemy moves are to (2,8), (2,6), (1,7), or (3,7)).\n  - LEFT to (1,5): On-board, currently empty. No collision risk; enemy cannot reach (1,5) in one move.\n  - RIGHT to (3,5): On-board, currently empty. No collision risk; enemy cannot reach (3,5) in one move (enemy moves are limited to adjacent cells).\n- **Apple Proximity**: The closest apple is at (4,5) (distance 2). \n  - UP (to (2,6)): Increases distance to (4,5) to 3; slightly decreases distance to (6,6) to 4, but (4,5) is priority.\n  - DOWN (to (2,4)): Increases distance to (4,5) to 3; decreases distance to (9,4) to 7 and to (0,1) to 5, but less efficient for immediate apple gain.\n  - LEFT (to (1,5)): Increases distance to (4,5) to 3; decreases distance to (0,1) to 5, but (0,1) is not the closest.\n  - RIGHT (to (3,5)): Decreases distance to (4,5) to 1 (optimal), keeping other apples at similar or increased distances. This positions me to eat (4,5) next turn if safe.\n- **Enemy Avoidance**: Enemy snake #1 at (2,7) may move towards nearby apples like (4,5) or (6,6). Moving RIGHT to (3,5) maintains a safe vertical distance (\u0394y=2 if enemy moves DOWN; \u0394y=3 if enemy moves UP or sideways). It minimizes convergence risk, as no shared cells are threatened except (2,6) for UP, which is avoided. Enemy movement analysis shows no direct threat to (3,5) this turn.\n- **Future Flexibility**: From (3,5), all moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) will likely be open next turn, providing multiple paths to apples or evasion. Moving RIGHT avoids edges and centralizes position. After eating (4,5) next turn, I will grow, so future moves must avoid new body segments.\n\n**Long-Term Plan for Turns 5+**:\n- Next turn (turn 5), if safe, move RIGHT to (4,5) to eat the apple. Before moving, check enemy position (especially if enemy moved towards (4,5) or (3,5)) to avoid head-on collision or body risks.\n- After growing, target the apple at (6,6) or (0,1), depending on enemy positions. (6,6) is accessible via (4,5) to (5,5) then (6,6); (0,1) via (3,5) leftward. Monitor snake #1 for movement towards apples like (6,6) or (7,2).\n- Maintain distance from enemies: prioritize horizontal/vertical separation. Avoid dead-ends by staying away from board edges unless necessary (e.g., for (0,1)).\n- If (4,5) is taken by enemy or unsafe, adapt immediately towards (6,6) or (0,1), using open paths.\n\nRIGHT",

(9,4) is less efficient.\n- Maintain distance from snake #1; avoid narrow paths or dead-ends (e.g., near edges) to preserve multiple safe moves each turn.\n- After growing, always check for backward moves into body; plan 1-2 turns ahead for apple targeting.\n\nAmong safe moves, RIGHT is optimal for immediate apple gain, positioning for future apples, and no emerging threats.\n\nRIGHT",

Possible moves:\n  - **UP to (4,6)**: On-board and empty (no snake body or obstruction). However, this risks a head-on collision if snake #1 moves DOWN to (4,6) simultaneously, as both snakes could occupy the same cell and die. Snake #1 is at (4,7) and could choose DOWN to approach the apple at (6,6), making this move risky.\n  - **DOWN to (4,4)**: On-board and empty. Safe from collisions, as snake #1 cannot reach (4,4) in one move. But this increases distance to the nearest apple (6,6) and may reduce future options by moving away from key apples.\n  - **LEFT to (3,5)**: Occupied by my own body segment. Moving directly backwards into body is lethal (rules: instant death). Eliminated.\n  - **RIGHT to (5,5)**: On-board and empty. Safe from collisions, as snake #1 cannot reach (5,5) this turn (possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT from (4,7) to adjacent cells only). Also avoids any immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n- **Apple Proximity**: The closest apple is at (6,6) with Manhattan distance 3 from (4,5). \n  - RIGHT to (5,5) reduces distance to (6,6) to 2 (Manhattan) and positions me well for a direct approach (e.g., next move to (6,5) or (5,6)).\n  - UP to (4,6) also reduces distance to (6,6) to 2 but carries collision risk with snake #1.\n  - DOWN to (4,4) increases distance to (6,6) to 4 and does not bring me closer to any other apple efficiently.\n  - Other apples are farther: (7,2) dist 6, (9,4) dist 6, (0,1) dist 8, (2,9) dist 6\u2014prioritizing (6,6) is optimal.\n\n- **Enemy Avoidance**: Snake #1 (head at (4,7), no body) poses a threat only if:\n  - It moves DOWN to (4,6) while I move UP to (4,6), causing mutual death. This is a significant risk, as snake #1 may target (6,6) via DOWN or RIGHT.\n  - Snake #1's other moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) do not conflict with RIGHT or DOWN. Moving RIGHT avoids this uncertainty and creates horizontal separation.\n\n- **Future Flexibility**: \n  - After RIGHT to (5,5), the body moves to (4,5), leaving head at (5,5). Next turn, safe moves include UP to (5,6), DOWN to (5,4), or RIGHT to (6,5)\u2014all open cells. This maintains multiple options for approaching (6,6) or adapting to threats.\n  - UP to (4,6) could limit next moves if snake #1 occupies adjacent cells, and DOWN to (4,4) reduces access to central areas.\n  - Long-term, focus on safely securing (6,6) while monitoring snake #1's movements. If (6,6) becomes contested, consider alternatives like (7,2) or (2,9), but avoid dead-ends.\n\n**Rationale for Turn 6**: Among safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT), RIGHT is optimal: it minimizes distance to the nearest apple (6,6), avoids all immediate risks (no board edge, body collision, or potential head-on collision with snake #1), and preserves future flexibility. UP is eliminated due to high collision risk with snake #1, and DOWN is less efficient for apple collection. Snake #1's behavior is unpredictable, but RIGHT reduces exposure.\n\n**Plan for Future Turns** (for next rationale):\n- **Next turn (turn 7)**: From (5,5), if safe, move RIGHT to (6,5) or UP to (5,6) to target (6,6). Assess snake #1's new position first\u2014if it threatens (6,6), evade or switch targets (e.g., toward (7,2)).\n- **General strategy**: Stay central when possible; avoid edges and snake #1. Grow by eating apples cautiously\u2014 (6,6) is priority, then reassess. If all apples are contested, focus on survival and forcing mistakes from snake #1.\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #1 moving RIGHT (to (6,7)) sets up potential future contest for (6,6), but we can adapt next turn.\n\n- **Future Flexibility**:\n  - After RIGHT: Head at (6,5), body at (5,5). Next turn, safe moves include RIGHT to (7,5), DOWN to (6,4), or UP to (6,6) if clear. Central positioning maintains options.\n  - After DOWN: Head at (5,4), body at (5,5). Limited upward access and farther from apples; forces moves further from game center.\n\n- **Comparison**: UP avoids due to lethal risk. DOWN is safe but inefficient. RIGHT maximizes safety, apple pursuit, and positioning.\n\n**Plan for Turn 8**:\n- **If snake #1 is far/different location** (e.g., moved UP/LEFT): Prioritize UP to (6,6) for the apple, securing growth.\n- **If snake #1 is near (6,6) or (6,7)**: Avoid simultaneous death risk. Divert to RIGHT to (7,5) or DOWN to (6,4). Target alternative apples like (7,2) or (9,4) if (6,6) is contested.\n- **General**: Maintain distance from snake #1 while targeting proximal apples. If (6,6) is taken, quickly refocus on (7,2) or (9,4).\n\nRIGHT",

Other apples are distant: (9,4) at distance 3, (0,1) at distance 9, (2,9) at distance 8, (0,9) at distance 9 \u2014 lower priority.\n\n- **Enemy Avoidance**: Snake #1 will likely target nearby apples like (9,4) or (7,2), but it cannot reach (7,2) this turn.

Moving DOWN secures (7,2) before snake #1 can approach, reducing competition.\n\n- **Future Flexibility**: \n  - **After DOWN (7,2)**: Head at (7,2), body at (7,3) and (7,4). Next turn, safe moves: DOWN to (7,1), LEFT to (6,2), RIGHT to (8,2). Avoid UP to (7,3) (body).

Next turn, LEFT to (7,3) is lethal, and moving toward (9,4) risks edge trapping after collection.\n\n- **Risk Assessment**: DOWN is optimal \u2014 guarantees apple collection with minimal risk. LEFT/RIGHT offer no immediate benefit and may delay scoring, potentially allowing snake #1 to close the apple gap. With an apple lead, securing points safely is key.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn**:\n- **After eating at (7,2)**: Prioritize safety \u2014 avoid UP into body. \n- **Target (9,4)**: Move RIGHT to (8,2) next turn to reduce distance (from 3 to 2), then approach (9,4) via (8,3) or (9,3). If snake #1 contests, reassess.\n- **Monitor snake #1**: If it eats an apple (e.g., (9,4)), maintain separation. If not, exploit its position to control apples.\n- **Long-term**: With 2 apples, play conservatively to extend lead. Avoid head-on collisions and dead-ends.

No head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n- **Apple Proximity and Targeting**:\n  - **Priority apples**: (2,1) and (0,1) are horizontally aligned with my position at (5,1). Manhattan distance to (2,1) is 3, to (0,1) is 5.\n  - **Enemy focus**: Snake #1 is adjacent to (9,4) and will likely take it this turn (via RIGHT).

Both offer 3 safe moves next turn but delay apple collection.\n  - **Risk assessment**: With an apple lead (2 vs 1), prioritize safe, efficient progress. LEFT minimizes turns to collect apples and avoids enemy zones (snake #1 focused on right side).\n\n**Plan for Next Turns**:\n- **After LEFT to (4,1)**:\n  - Turn 16: Move LEFT to (3,1) if safe (check board and enemy).\n  - Target (2,1) by Turn 17: (4,1) \u2192 (3,1) \u2192 (2,1) [eat apple].\n  - Post-(2,1): Proceed to (0,1) (Turn 19).

Otherwise, focus on top apples.\n- **Contingencies**: If (0,1) becomes unsafe next turn (e.g., enemy moves to (1,1)? Impossible because enemy is at (7,5) minimum after one move and then (6,5) or similar), then from (1,1) I can divert UP or DOWN. But unlikely.\n\nLEFT",

RIGHT to (6,4) is invalid (into own body at (6,4)).\n  - My potential moves: (0,4) or (1,3).

Moving UP to (0,4) positions me to reach (0,6) in 2 moves (UP twice) and (0,9) in 5 moves, securing apples efficiently.\n  - Apple at (2,9) is accessible later via rightward moves after ascending.\n  - Apple at (2,0) is blocked by my body (at (2,1)) and not urgent.\n  - Apple at (8,4) is near Snake #1; they may eat it soon, but it's distant from me (Manhattan distance 8+).\n  - Moving RIGHT to (1,3) delays access to vertical apples (e.g., (0,6) requires 4+ moves via (1,4), (0,4), etc.), reducing efficiency.\n\n- **Future Flexibility**:\n  - **UP to (0,4)**: Next turn, safe moves likely UP to (0,5) (toward apples) or RIGHT to (1,4) (escape edge). Avoids dead-ends; path to (0,6)/(0,9) remains open. Aligns with prior plan for vertical apples.\n  - **RIGHT to (1,3)**: Next turn, safe moves include UP to (1,4), DOWN to (1,2), or RIGHT to (2,3). Offers more options but delays apple collection and risks entanglement near my body (e.g., (1,1), (2,1)) if moving down/right. No immediate apple gain.\n\n- **Risk Assessment**: Snake #1 is focused on (8,4) or other paths, posing minimal threat. UP optimizes apple collection (scores tied at 4-4) and maintains a direct, low-risk path. RIGHT provides no advantage and may lead to inefficiency.\n\n**Plan for Next Turns**:\n- **Turn 22**: Move UP to (0,4) to advance toward (0,6) apple.\n- **Turn 23**: From (0,4), move UP to (0,5) if safe (preferred) or RIGHT to (1,4) if UP blocked (e.g., by unexpected move). Avoid DOWN (lethal into body at (0,3)).\n- **Beyond**: Proceed to (0,6) (apple in 2 turns), then (0,9). After securing vertical apples, route to (2,9) via center if safe. Monitor Snake #1\u2014if they eat (8,4), score ties at 5-5; track position to avoid collisions.\n- **Contingencies**: If (0,5) is unsafe next turn (e.g., enemy moves near), divert RIGHT to (1,4) and reassess.

Board shows '.' (empty), no snake body occupies it at start. Enemy snake #1 is distant (head at (7,4), Manhattan distance |2-7| + |8-4| = 9), so no collision risk. Safe.\n  - LEFT: To (1,9).

Enemy distant (|3-7| + |9-4| = 9), safe.\n- **Viable Moves**: DOWN (to (2,8)) and RIGHT (to (3,9)) are both safe.\n- **Apple Proximity and Strategy**:\n  - Apples at (1,6), (1,4), and (1,3) are reachable and align with the descent plan from last turn. Moving DOWN to (2,8) directly progresses toward these: next moves can be LEFT to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7), then DOWN to (1,6) to eat the apple. This path is efficient and collects multiple apples quickly (3 apples in 4 moves if safe).\n  - Moving RIGHT to (3,9) delays apple collection, as no apples are nearby. It may require extra moves to return left (e.g., DOWN then LEFT), wasting turns and increasing risk of enemy interference or future traps.\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 1) Consideration**:\n  - Head at (7,4) with possible moves: UP (to (7,5)), DOWN (to (7,3)), LEFT (to (6,4)). RIGHT is lethal (into own body at (8,4)).\n  - Enemy actions won't affect this turn: all possible moves are distant from (2,8) or (3,9) (min Manhattan distance 9). No head-on collision or immediate threat.\n  - Enemy may target apples at (5,0) or (1,4), but (1,4) is closer to us (we can reach it sooner). With 7 vs 5 apples, we maintain a lead by prioritizing quick apple collection.\n- **Board and Trap Avoidance**:\n  - Current body blocks left column (x=0), but moving DOWN to (2,8) keeps us in open space. From (2,8), multiple options remain open (e.g., LEFT to (1,8) or DOWN to (2,7)), avoiding dead-ends.\n  - RIGHT to (3,9) moves toward the center/right, where fewer apples exist, and may limit future moves if enemy approaches later.\n- **Long-Term Plan (Next 3-4 Turns)**:\n  - Turn 30: DOWN to (2,8) \u2192 eat no apple (no growth, tail moves).\n  - Turn 31: If safe, LEFT to (1,8) \u2192 still no apple.\n  - Turn 32: DOWN to (1,7) \u2192 no apple.\n  - Turn 33: DOWN to (1,6) \u2192 eat apple (grow, score to 8).\n  - Then target (1,5), (1,4) (apple), (1,3) (apple) in sequence.\n  - Monitor enemy: if it moves toward (1,4) or (1,3), adjust path (e.g., go to (2,7) instead of (1,7) if risky).

Enemy snake #1 is distant (head at (6,4), Manhattan distance |2-6| + |7-4| = 9), and enemy moves (UP/DOWN/LEFT) cannot reach (2,7) this turn \u2192 safe.\n  - LEFT: To (1,8). Board shows '.' (empty), no immediate collision. However, moving here reduces future options: next turn, only DOWN to (1,7) is safe (UP/RIGHT/LEFT lead into body), creating a potential trap. Avoid unless necessary.\n  - RIGHT: To (3,8). Board shows '.' (empty), enemy distant \u2192 safe. But moves away from clustered apples (left side), delaying collection.\n- **Viable Moves**: DOWN (to (2,7)) and RIGHT (to (3,8)) are safe. LEFT is technically safe but risky due to limited follow-up moves.\n- **Apple Proximity and Strategy**:\n  - Apples at (1,6), (1,4), (1,3) are high-priority (clustered, efficient path). Current position (2,8) \u2192 DOWN to (2,7) maintains direct path: next turn LEFT to (1,7), then DOWN to (1,6) to eat apple on turn 33. Moving LEFT to (1,8) achieves same path but with fewer options next turn.\n  - RIGHT to (3,8) moves away from apples, requiring detours (e.g., down then left) \u2192 inefficient. Apples at (2,0)/(5,0) are distant; prioritize closer cluster.\n  - Lead is 7 vs 5 apples \u2192 prioritize quick, safe collection to extend lead.\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 1) Consideration**:\n  - Head at (6,4), possible moves: UP (to (6,5)), DOWN (to (6,3)), LEFT (to (5,4)). RIGHT is lethal (into body).\n  - Enemy may target apples at (1,4)/(1,3) or (5,0). If enemy moves left, it could reach (1,4) by turn 35 (5 moves). Our path to (1,4) (via (1,6) eat on turn 33, then (1,5) on turn 34, (1,4) on turn 35) risks head-on collision if enemy arrives simultaneously \u2192 need flexibility to divert later.\n  - DOWN to (2,7) keeps distance (enemy min Manhattan distance 9 this turn) and allows monitoring enemy movement before committing to left column.\n- **Board and Trap Avoidance**:\n  - DOWN to (2,7) preserves multiple options next turn (DOWN to (2,6), LEFT to (1,7), RIGHT to (3,7)) \u2192 avoids dead-ends. LEFT to (1,8) funnels into single path (DOWN only), increasing vulnerability if enemy approaches later.\n  - Tail moves to (0,6) after this turn (no apple eaten), freeing (0,5) \u2192 no immediate benefit but maintains space.\n- **Long-Term Plan (Next 3-4 Turns)**:\n  - Turn 31: DOWN to (2,7) \u2192 no apple (tail moves, no growth).\n  - Turn 32: If safe, LEFT to (1,7) \u2192 progress toward (1,6) apple. If enemy threatens, DOWN to (2,6) or RIGHT to (3,7) as alternatives.\n  - Turn 33: DOWN to (1,6) \u2192 eat apple (grow to 8 apples). Then assess:\n    - If enemy near (1,4), divert right/down (e.g., to (2,6) or (1,5)) to avoid collision.\n    - Else, continue down left column for (1,4) and (1,3) apples.\n  - Monitor enemy: if it moves toward left apples, consider switching to (2,0) or (5,0) path after (1,6) to maintain lead safely.\n\nDOWN",

I must evaluate all four directions for immediate safety (avoiding off-board, my own body, or other snakes' bodies):  \n- **UP**: (0, 4) \u2013 Board shows row 4, column 0 as \".\" (empty). Safe.  \n- **DOWN**: (0, 2) \u2013 Board shows row 2, column 0 as \"T\" (occupied by my body segment). Moving into own body is deadly.  \n- **LEFT**: (-1, 3) \u2013 Off-board. Deadly.  \n- **RIGHT**: (1, 3) \u2013 Board shows row 3, column 1 as \"T\" (occupied by my body segment). Moving into own body is deadly.  \n\n**Safe options:** Only UP is a viable move. All other directions result in immediate death.  \n\n**Apple Proximity and Pathing:**  \nApples are at (2,0), (5,0), (2,5), (6,8), (4,6). After moving UP to (0,4):  \n- Distance to (2,5) decreases from 5 to 4 (Manhattan: |0-2| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3).  \n- Distance to (4,6) decreases from 7 to 6 (|0-4| + |4-6| = 4 + 2 = 6).  \n- Apples at (2,0) and (5,0) become less accessible due to my position moving away from the bottom edge.  \nThe path to (2,5) is attractive: from (0,4), I can move UP to (0,5) next turn (currently empty), then RIGHT toward (1,5) or (2,5).  \n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1) Behavior:**  \n- Head at (4,3). Safe moves: UP to (4,4) (empty), LEFT to (3,3) (empty), RIGHT to (5,3) (empty). DOWN to (4,2) is deadly (own body).  \n- Enemy is likely targeting (4,6) (distance 3) or (2,5) (distance 4). With my lead (10 vs. 6 apples), I should avoid direct confrontation and prioritize safe apple collection.  \n- No risk of head-on collision at (0,4): enemy is too far (Manhattan distance 5) and cannot reach it in one move.  \n\n**Risk Assessment:**  \n- Only one safe move, so survival depends on UP.  \n- After moving UP, the new head position (0,4) maintains options: UP to (0,5) or RIGHT to (1,4) may be available next turn, depending on body shifts (since no apple is eaten this turn, the tail will move).  \n- Long-term, staying near the left edge reduces exposure to the enemy, who is centered around (4,3).  \n\n**Long-Term Plan for Next Turns:**  \n- **Turn 41 (from (0,4))**: Aim to move UP to (0,5) if safe, accessing the area near apple (2,5).  \n- **Beyond**: From (0,5), move RIGHT toward (2,5) or continue UP to (0,6) to target apples (4,6) or (6,8). Avoid moving toward bottom apples (2,0) and (5,0) to minimize conflict with enemy, who may target them.  \n- **General Strategy**: Leverage apple lead by playing safely. Focus on upper apples where enemy presence is weaker. Monitor enemy moves to evade potential traps.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nUP is the only safe move and aligns with the path to valuable apples while maintaining future mobility.  \n\nUP",

Aligns with conservative strategy due to apple lead.  \n\n**Next Turn Plan (from (1,8)):**  \n- Prioritize RIGHT to (2,8) for central access and path to (6,8).  \n- If RIGHT blocked, use UP to (1,9) as backup.  \n- Monitor enemy: If they eat (2,5), focus on (6,8) or (3,1). Avoid head-on risks; leverage lead for survival.  \n\nUP",

Eliminated.  \n- **RIGHT (to (7,8))**: On board. Empty (no body/enemy segment). Safe.  \n\nSafe options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n**Head-on Collision Risk (Simultaneous Moves):**  \n- Enemy snake #1 (head at (3,1)) safe moves: DOWN (to (3,0)), LEFT (to (2,1)), RIGHT (to (4,1)).  \n- None of these enemy moves target (6,9), (6,7), or (7,8). No head-on collision risk for any safe move.  \n\n**Apple Proximity and Growth Opportunity:**  \n- No apples adjacent to (6,8): closest are (8,4) (distance 6) and (8,2) (distance 8).  \n- Moving RIGHT to (7,8) reduces distance to (8,4) to 5 and (8,2) to 7.  \n- Moving DOWN to (6,7) reduces distance to (8,4) to 5 and (5,0) to 8, but (5,0) is farther than (8,4).  \n- Moving UP to (6,9) increases distance to all apples (e.g., (8,4) to 7).  \n- Prioritize (8,4) as the nearest apple; RIGHT provides the most direct path.  \n\n**Future Move Flexibility:**  \n- **RIGHT to (7,8)**:  \n  - Next turn options: UP (to (7,9)), DOWN (to (7,7)), RIGHT (to (8,8)) \u2014 all currently empty. Avoid LEFT (deadly, into new body at (6,8)). High flexibility (3 moves).  \n  - Positions near right edge for efficient access to apples at (8,4) and (8,2).  \n- **DOWN to (6,7)**:  \n  - Next turn options: DOWN (to (6,6)), LEFT (to (5,7)), RIGHT (to (7,7)) \u2014 UP deadly. Moderate flexibility (3 moves), but moves away from key apples and toward enemy territory.  \n- **UP to (6,9)**:  \n  - Next turn options: LEFT (to (5,9)), RIGHT (to (7,9)) \u2014 UP off-board, DOWN deadly. Low flexibility (2 moves). Top edge increases risk of future traps.  \n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1) Behavior:**  \n- Likely targeting apple at (4,2) (distance 2 from enemy head). Minimal threat to our path; enemy moves this turn (DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT) avoid our area.  \n- Enemy body positions (e.g., (4,4)-(4,6)) pose no immediate risk.  \n\n**Risk Assessment:**  \n- All safe moves avoid death and head-on collisions.  \n- RIGHT maximizes progress toward high-value apples (8,4) and (8,2) while preserving flexibility.  \n- UP reduces flexibility and delays apple access; DOWN offers no advantage and risks unnecessary proximity to enemy.  \n\n**Long-Term Plan:**  \n- Secure apples on the right: move RIGHT to (7,8) this turn.  \n- Next turn (from (7,8)): Prioritize RIGHT to (8,8) or DOWN to (7,7) to approach (8,4). Avoid LEFT (deadly).  \n- Monitor enemy movement toward (4,2); concede that apple if contested. Leverage apple lead (11 vs 10) to play conservatively.  \n- Focus on survival: avoid edges when possible and maintain at least 2 safe moves per turn.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT positions optimally for apple collection, maintains flexibility, and aligns with long-term pathing to (8,4)/(8,2).  \n\nRIGHT",

Contains apple ('A'), no snake segment. Safe.  \n\nSafe options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n**Head-on Collision Risk (Simultaneous Moves):**  \n- Enemy snake #1 (head at (4,2)) safe moves: UP (to (4,3)), RIGHT (to (5,2)) (DOWN and LEFT deadly).  \n- Our moves: (8,9), (8,7), (9,8) are distant from enemy's possible moves (4,3) and (5,2). No head-on collision risk.  \n\n**Apple Proximity and Growth Opportunity:**  \n- Apple at (9,8) is adjacent. Moving RIGHT eats it immediately, growing to 12 apples and securing a lead.  \n- Apples at (8,4) and (8,2) are accessible via DOWN moves but farther. Prioritizing (9,8) is efficient and denies no immediate threat.  \n- Enemy may target (8,2) or (5,0) from their position, but (9,8) is uncontested.  \n\n**Future Move Flexibility:**  \n- **RIGHT to (9,8)**: Eats apple, grows. Next turn: UP (to (9,9)) and DOWN (to (9,7)) safe. Flexibility: 2 moves.  \n- **DOWN to (8,7)**: No apple. Next turn: DOWN (to (8,6)), LEFT (to (7,7)), RIGHT (to (9,7)) safe. Flexibility: 3 moves.  \n- **UP to (8,9)**: No apple. Next turn: LEFT (to (7,9)), RIGHT (to (9,9)) safe. Flexibility: 2 moves.  \n- DOWN offers more flexibility, but RIGHT secures growth and lead, aligning with core objective.  \n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1) Behavior:**  \n- Enemy likely moves RIGHT to (5,2) (toward apples (5,0) and (8,2)) or UP to (4,3). Minimal threat to our position.  \n\n**Risk Assessment:**  \n- All safe moves avoid death. RIGHT is low-risk due to enemy distance.  \n- Delaying (9,8) risks losing growth advantage; enemy may tie if they eat an apple first.  \n\n**Long-Term Plan for Next Turns:**  \n- **Turn 53**: Eat (9,8) to grow to 12 and lead.  \n- **Turn 54**: From (9,8), move DOWN to (9,7) to access bottom apples and avoid top-edge trap.  \n- **Post-turn 54**: Head toward (8,4) via (9,7) \u2192 (8,7) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (8,5) \u2192 (8,4), monitoring enemy progress on (8,2).  \n- Secure apples (8,4) and (8,2) while maintaining lead.

Eliminated.  \n\nSafe options: DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Head-on Collision Risk (Simultaneous Moves):**  \n- Enemy snake #1 (head at (6,2)) safe moves: UP (to (6,3)), DOWN (to (6,1)), RIGHT (to (7,2)).  \n- Our possible moves: (9,6) or (8,7).  \n- Manhattan distance from (9,6) to enemy's possible heads: min 7 (e.g., to (7,2) is |9-7| + |6-2| = 4).  \n- Manhattan distance from (8,7) to enemy's possible heads: min 7 (e.g., to (7,2) is |8-7| + |7-2| = 6).  \n- No overlap with enemy's possible moves this turn. Low risk.  \n\n**Apple Proximity and Growth Opportunity:**  \n- Target apple: (8,6) is closest and reachable in 1 move from both safe options.  \n  - Moving LEFT to (8,7) positions us adjacent to (8,6) (Manhattan distance 1).  \n  - Moving DOWN to (9,6) also positions us adjacent to (8,6) (Manhattan distance 1).  \n- Both moves set up apple consumption next turn (Turn 56):  \n  - LEFT: Next turn DOWN to (8,6) eats apple.  \n  - DOWN: Next turn LEFT to (8,6) eats apple.  \n- Secondary apples: (8,4) and (8,2) are accessible via downward path from (8,6). LEFT move aligns better for this path.  \n\n**Future Move Flexibility:**  \n- **LEFT to (8,7)**:  \n  - Next turn (Turn 56): Safe moves likely DOWN (to (8,6)) for apple, and possibly LEFT (to (7,7)) or RIGHT (to (9,7)) if not blocked.  \n  - After eating (8,6), from (8,6): DOWN (to (8,5)), LEFT (to (7,6)), RIGHT (to (9,6)) may be available (preserves options).  \n- **DOWN to (9,6)**:  \n  - Next turn (Turn 56): Safe move LEFT (to (8,6)) for apple.  \n  - After eating (8,6), from (8,6): DOWN (to (8,5)) and LEFT (to (7,6)) available, but RIGHT (to (9,6)) blocked by own body (if DOWN chosen this turn).  \n- LEFT provides better long-term flexibility by keeping the right edge (x=9) open for future moves.  \n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1) Behavior:**  \n- Enemy likely targets (8,2) (closest apple, 2 moves away) or (5,0) (3 moves away).  \n- Current position (6,2) poses no immediate threat to (8,6) or our path (enemy needs 5+ moves to reach (8,6)).  \n- Monitor enemy progress toward (8,4)/(8,2) to avoid head-on collisions in future turns.  \n\n**Risk Assessment:**  \n- Both moves are low-risk this turn (no immediate death).  \n- LEFT minimizes dead-end risk: avoids trapping near right edge (x=9) and maintains access to board center.  \n- DOWN risks future inflexibility (blocks (9,6) after apple consumption).  \n\n**Long-Term Plan for Next Turns:**  \n- **Turn 55**: Move LEFT to (8,7) to optimize for (8,6) apple and preserve movement options.  \n- **Turn 56**: Move DOWN to (8,6) to eat apple (if safe; check for enemy interference).  \n- **Post-Turn 56**:  \n  - Target (8,4) via DOWN to (8,5) then (8,4).  \n  - Assess enemy position: if enemy approaches (8,4) (e.g., from (8,2)), divert to avoid head-on collision (e.g., RIGHT to (9,6) if open, then down toward (9,5) for other apples).  \n  - Alternative paths: If (8,4) is contested, consider moving right/down for (5,0) or (2,0).  \n- Maintain apple lead (12 vs 11) by securing (8,6) safely.  \n\nLEFT",

Low risk for both moves.  \n\n**Apple Proximity and Growth Opportunity:**  \n- Closest apple: (8,6) is directly below us. Moving DOWN eats it immediately, increasing our apple count to 13 and growing by 1 segment.  \n- Moving LEFT (to (7,7)) does not eat an apple this turn and delays access to (8,6).  \n- Secondary apples: (8,4) and (8,2) are accessible downward from (8,6). DOWN positions us optimally to pursue these next.  \n\n**Future Move Flexibility:**  \n- **DOWN to (8,6)**:  \n  - Next turn (Turn 57): Safe moves likely DOWN (to (8,5)), LEFT (to (7,6)), or RIGHT (to (9,6)), avoiding UP (which will be own body).  \n  - After eating, we gain length but maintain multiple paths: downward for (8,4)/(8,2), leftward for center access, or rightward if open.  \n- **LEFT to (7,7)**:  \n  - Next turn (Turn 57): Safe moves DOWN (to (7,6)) or LEFT/RIGHT if available.  \n  - Delays apple consumption, risking enemy interception of (8,6) in future turns (enemy can reach it in 4-5 moves).  \n- DOWN maximizes immediate growth and preserves options for downward path or evasion.  \n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1) Behavior:**  \n- Enemy likely targets (8,2) (closest apple, 1 move away via RIGHT) or (5,0)/(2,0).  \n- If enemy moves RIGHT to (8,2) this turn, it may advance upward toward (8,4)/(8,6), creating potential head-on collision risk at (8,4) in 2 turns. Monitor next turn.  \n- No immediate threat to (8,6) this turn (enemy minimum 4 moves away).  \n\n**Risk Assessment:**  \n- Both moves are low-risk this turn (no board edge or body collisions).  \n- DOWN provides guaranteed apple consumption, extending our lead (13 vs 11).  \n- LEFT avoids growth but offers no advantage; it risks losing (8,6) and complicates future paths.  \n\n**Long-Term Plan for Next Turns:**  \n- **Turn 56**: Move DOWN to (8,6) to eat apple and grow.  \n- **Turn 57**: From (8,6), prioritize:  \n  - DOWN to (8,5) if safe, to approach (8,4).  \n  - If enemy is at (8,2) or moving upward, avoid head-on collision by diverting LEFT (to (7,6)) or RIGHT (to (9,6)) instead of DOWN.  \n  - Assess enemy position: if enemy is near (8,4), target alternate apples (e.g., (5,0) via left/down paths).  \n- **Post-Turn 57**:  \n  - Secure (8,4) if uncontested; else, pivot to (5,0) or (2,0) via leftward moves.  \n  - Maintain apple lead by prioritizing safe consumption over risky pursuits.  \n\nDOWN",

Safe.  \n\nSafe options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Head-on Collision Risk (Simultaneous Moves):**  \n- Enemy snake #1 (head at (8,2)) safe moves: UP (to (8,3)), DOWN (to (8,1)), RIGHT (to (9,2)) (LEFT to (7,2) is deadly due to own body).  \n- Our possible moves: (8,5), (7,6), (9,6).  \n- No overlap with enemy's possible moves: (8,5) \u2260 (8,3), (8,1), (9,2); (7,6) \u2260 (8,3), (8,1), (9,2); (9,6) \u2260 (8,3), (8,1), (9,2).  \n- No head-on collision risk for any move this turn.  \n\n**Apple Proximity and Growth Opportunity:**  \n- Closest apple: (8,4) is 2 moves away (DOWN to (8,5), then DOWN to (8,4)).  \n- Moving DOWN to (8,5) positions us to reach (8,4) next turn (if safe).  \n- Moving LEFT to (7,6) or RIGHT to (9,6) delays access to (8,4) and other apples (e.g., (5,0), (2,0)).  \n- However, DOWN risks conflict with enemy snake #1 for (8,4) next turn (enemy at (8,2) can reach (8,4) in 2 moves).  \n\n**Future Move Flexibility:**  \n- **DOWN to (8,5)**:  \n  - Next turn (Turn 58): Safe moves likely DOWN (to (8,4)), LEFT (to (7,5)), RIGHT (to (9,5)). UP (to (8,6)) blocked by own body.  \n  - Risk: If enemy moves UP to (8,3) this turn, both snakes could target (8,4) next turn, risking head-on collision.  \n  - Flexibility: Two safe moves (LEFT/RIGHT) if avoiding (8,4).  \n- **LEFT to (7,6)**:  \n  - Next turn (Turn 58): Safe moves UP (to (7,7)), DOWN (to (7,5)), LEFT (to (6,6)). RIGHT (to (8,6)) blocked by own body.  \n  - Avoids immediate conflict over (8,4). Provides access to center and bottom apples (e.g., (5,0), (2,0)) via DOWN/LEFT.  \n  - Flexibility: Three safe moves, reducing dead-end risk.  \n- **RIGHT to (9,6)**:  \n  - Next turn (Turn 58): Only safe move DOWN (to (9,5)) (UP blocked by body, LEFT blocked by body, RIGHT off-board).  \n  - High risk of trapping (e.g., after DOWN to (9,5), only DOWN/LEFT may be safe, but board edge limits options).  \n  - Poor flexibility; eliminated.  \n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1) Behavior:**  \n- Enemy likely targets (8,4) (2 moves away) or bottom apples ((5,0), (2,0)).  \n- If enemy moves UP to (8,3) this turn, conflict at (8,4) next turn is possible if we move DOWN.  \n- Current lead (13 vs 12 apples) allows conservative play; prioritize survival over risky apple pursuit.  \n\n**Risk Assessment:**  \n- All moves safe this turn.  \n- DOWN risks head-on collision at (8,4) next turn if enemy moves UP.  \n- LEFT avoids conflict, maintains flexibility, and accesses alternative apples safely.  \n- RIGHT leads to dead-end; high future risk.  \n\n**Long-Term Plan for Next Turns:**  \n- **Turn 57**: Move LEFT to (7,6) to avoid (8,4) conflict risk and maintain options.  \n- **Turn 58**: From (7,6), prioritize:  \n  - DOWN to (7,5) to approach bottom apples ((5,0), (2,0)).  \n  - If enemy threatens, use UP/LEFT for evasion or target (1,2)/(1,3).  \n- **Future**: Monitor enemy movement toward (8,4). If uncontested, consider circling back via (7,4)/(8,4). Otherwise, focus on bottom apples. Maintain apple lead by safe consumption.  \n\nLEFT",

Eliminated.  \n\nSafe options: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Head-on Collision Risk (Simultaneous Moves):**  \n- Enemy snake #1 (head at (9,3)) safe moves: UP (to (9,4)) or LEFT (to (8,3)); DOWN/RIGHT deadly.  \n- Our possible moves: (6,7), (6,5), (5,6).  \n- No overlap with enemy's possible moves ((9,4) or (8,3)): all positions are distant (e.g., (6,5) vs (8,3) is dx=2, dy=2).  \n- No head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Apple Proximity and Growth Opportunity:**  \n- Apples: (2,0), (5,0), (8,4), (1,2), (1,3).  \n- (8,4) is likely eaten by enemy next turn (enemy can reach it in 1 move from (9,4) or (8,3)). Prioritize left/bottom apples: (1,2), (1,3), (5,0), (2,0).  \n- From (6,6):  \n  - DOWN to (6,5): Reduces Manhattan distance to (5,0) (from 7 to 6), (1,2) (from 9 to 8), and (1,3) (from 8 to 7).  \n  - LEFT to (5,6): Reduces distance to (1,2) (from 9 to 8) and (1,3) (from 8 to 7), but same distance to (5,0) (6 moves).  \n  - UP to (6,7): Increases distance to all apples.  \n- DOWN positions us better for (5,0) and maintains access to left apples via future down/left moves.  \n\n**Future Move Flexibility:**  \n- **UP to (6,7)**:  \n  - Next turn: Only LEFT (to (5,7)) and RIGHT (to (7,7)) safe; UP/DOWN blocked by body. Poor flexibility (2 options).  \n- **DOWN to (6,5)**:  \n  - Next turn: Safe moves DOWN (to (6,4)), LEFT (to (5,5)), RIGHT (to (7,5)). UP blocked by body. High flexibility (3 options).  \n  - Accesses open bottom rows (y=0-5), avoiding crowded top area.  \n- **LEFT to (5,6)**:  \n  - Next turn: Safe moves UP (to (5,7)), DOWN (to (5,5)), LEFT (to (4,6)). RIGHT blocked by body. High flexibility (3 options).  \n  - Moves toward left apples but delays descent to bottom apples.  \n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1) Behavior:**  \n- Enemy likely eats (8,4) next turn (Turn 60) via UP/LEFT move.  \n- Enemy is distant from left/bottom apples (min. 7-8 moves away), giving us uncontested access.  \n- Current lead (13 vs 12 apples) allows conservative play; avoid conflict and focus on safe apple collection.  \n\n**Risk Assessment:**  \n- All moves safe this turn.  \n- UP eliminated due to poor flexibility and moving away from apples.  \n- DOWN and LEFT both offer high flexibility, but DOWN better reduces distance to multiple apples (especially (5,0)) and accesses less crowded area.  \n- No immediate conflict risk; enemy focused on (8,4).  \n\n**Long-Term Plan for Next Turns:**  \n- **Turn 59**: Move DOWN to (6,5) to approach bottom apples (5,0), (2,0) and left apples (1,2), (1,3) efficiently.  \n- **Turn 60**: From (6,5), move LEFT to (5,5) to close on (5,0) and set up for leftward path to (1,2)/(1,3).  \n- **Future**: Monitor enemy movement\u2014if enemy moves down after (8,4), evade via open paths. Prioritize (5,0) as closest uncontested apple, then (1,3)/(1,2). Maintain survival and apple lead by staying in open areas (bottom rows).  \n\nDOWN",

Eliminated.  \n\nSafe options: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Head-on Collision Risk (Simultaneous Moves):**  \n- Enemy snake #1 (head at (8,4)) safe moves: UP (to (8,5)), DOWN (to (8,3)), LEFT (to (7,4)).  \n- Our possible moves: (5,6), (5,4), (4,5).  \n- No overlap with enemy's possible moves:  \n  - (5,6) vs (8,5), (8,3), (7,4): all distinct.  \n  - (5,4) vs (8,5), (8,3), (7,4): all distinct.  \n  - (4,5) vs (8,5), (8,3), (7,4): all distinct.  \n- No head-on collision risk.  \n\n**Apple Proximity and Growth Opportunity:**  \n- Apples: (0,5), (1,2), (1,3), (2,0), (5,0).  \n- From (5,5):  \n  - **UP to (5,6)**: Increases Manhattan distance to all apples (e.g., (0,5): 5\u21926, (5,0): 5\u21926). Poor for growth.  \n  - **DOWN to (5,4)**: Improves distance to (1,2) (7\u21926), (1,3) (6\u21925), (2,0) (8\u21927), (5,0) (5\u21924). But (5,0) is blocked by enemy body (row 2 occupied), making it inaccessible.  \n  - **LEFT to (4,5)**: Improves distance to (0,5) (5\u21924), (1,2) (7\u21926), (1,3) (6\u21925), (2,0) (8\u21927). (0,5) is reachable via a clear leftward path.  \n- UP eliminated due to moving away from apples. LEFT provides best access to (0,5) and left-side apples.  \n\n**Future Move Flexibility:**  \n- **UP to (5,6)**:  \n  - Next turn: Safe moves UP (to (5,7)), DOWN (to (5,5) blocked by body), LEFT (to (4,6)), RIGHT (to (6,6) blocked by body). Flexibility: 2 options (limited).  \n  - Positions snake higher, risking edge traps.  \n- **DOWN to (5,4)**:  \n  - Next turn: Safe moves DOWN (to (5,3)), LEFT (to (4,4)), RIGHT (to (6,4)). UP blocked by body. Flexibility: 3 options.  \n  - Near enemy body blockade (row 2), limiting long-term pathing to apples.  \n- **LEFT to (4,5)**:  \n  - Next turn: Safe moves UP (to (4,6)), DOWN (to (4,4)), LEFT (to (3,5)). RIGHT blocked by body. Flexibility: 3 options.  \n  - Opens clear path to (0,5) apple via leftward moves, with descent to (1,2), (1,3), (2,0) possible.  \n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1) Behavior:**  \n- Enemy focused on central/top areas (possible moves to (8,5) or (8,3)). Distant from left apples (min. 9+ moves to (0,5)), giving uncontested access.  \n- Enemy body blocks bottom-right (row 2), making (5,0) inaccessible. Avoid this area.  \n\n**Risk Assessment:**  \n- All moves safe this turn.  \n- UP eliminated due to poor apple proximity and flexibility.  \n- DOWN leads to potential dead-end near enemy body.  \n- LEFT aligns with long-term plan, avoids traps, and maximizes apple opportunities.  \n\n**Long-Term Plan for Next Turns:**  \n- **Turn 61**: Move LEFT to (4,5) to advance toward (0,5).  \n- **Turn 62**: Move LEFT to (3,5) if safe (check enemy positions).  \n- **Turn 63**: Move LEFT to (2,5).  \n- **Turn 64**: Move LEFT to (1,5).  \n- **Turn 65**: Move LEFT to (0,5) to eat apple.  \n- Post-apple: Descend left edge (e.g., (0,4), (0,3), ... to (0,0)) to collect (2,0), then move to (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) for remaining apples.  \n- Avoid row 2 (enemy body) and monitor enemy movement from a distance.  \n\nLEFT",

Cell (2,5) is empty ('.' on board). Not occupied by any snake body. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT (to (4,5))**: Occupied by own body segment (next segment at (4,5)). Moving into own body is deadly. Eliminated.  \n\nSafe options: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Head-on Collision Risk (Simultaneous Moves):**  \n- Enemy snake #1 (head at (6,4)) safe moves: DOWN (to (6,3)) or LEFT (to (5,4)) (UP and RIGHT are deadly due to body occupancy).  \n- Our possible moves: (3,6), (3,4), (2,5).  \n- No overlap with enemy's possible moves:  \n  - (3,6) vs (6,3) or (5,4): all distinct.  \n  - (3,4) vs (6,3) or (5,4): all distinct.  \n  - (2,5) vs (6,3) or (5,4): all distinct.  \n- No head-on collision risk for any move.  \n\n**Apple Proximity and Growth Opportunity:**  \n- Apples: (0,5), (1,2), (1,3), (2,0), (5,0).  \n- From (3,5):  \n  - **UP to (3,6)**: Increases Manhattan distance to all apples (e.g., (0,5): 3\u21924, (1,3): 4\u21925). Moves away from apples; poor for growth.  \n  - **DOWN to (3,4)**: Improves distance to (1,3) (4\u21923) and (1,2) (5\u21924), but (0,5) worsens (3\u21924). (5,0) is blocked by enemy body (row 2), making it inaccessible.  \n  - **LEFT to (2,5)**: Significantly improves distance to (0,5) (3\u21922) and (1,3) (4\u21923). Also improves access to (1,2) and (2,0) long-term. (5,0) is distant and risky due to enemy.  \n- UP eliminated due to moving away from apples. DOWN offers some improvement but prioritizes lower-priority apples near enemy territory. LEFT best for immediate apple path.  \n\n**Future Move Flexibility:**  \n- **UP to (3,6)**:  \n  - Next turn: Moves UP (to (3,7)), LEFT (to (2,6)), RIGHT (to (4,6)) likely safe. DOWN blocked by body. Flexibility: 3 options.  \n  - Positions snake higher, increasing edge risk and reducing access to left-side apples.  \n- **DOWN to (3,4)**:  \n  - Next turn: Moves DOWN (to (3,3)), LEFT (to (2,4)), RIGHT (to (4,4)) likely safe. UP blocked by body. Flexibility: 3 options.  \n  - Near enemy body (row 2), increasing entrapment risk and limiting long-term pathing.  \n- **LEFT to (2,5)**:  \n  - Next turn: Moves UP (to (2,6)), DOWN (to (2,4)), LEFT (to (1,5)) likely safe. RIGHT blocked by body. Flexibility: 3 options.  \n  - Maintains clear path to (0,5) with minimal risk and preserves options for descending left side.  \n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1) Behavior:**  \n- Enemy focused on bottom-right (possible moves to (6,3) or (5,4)). Distant from left apples (min. 6+ moves to (0,5)), giving uncontested access. Enemy body blocks row 2, making (5,0) and bottom apples risky; avoid this area.  \n\n**Risk Assessment:**  \n- All moves safe this turn with no head-on collision risk.  \n- UP eliminated due to poor apple proximity.  \n- DOWN risks future entrapment near enemy body and moves away from high-priority (0,5).  \n- LEFT aligns with long-term plan, minimizes risk, and maximizes apple opportunities.  \n\n**Long-Term Plan for Next Turns:**  \n- **Turn 63**: Move LEFT to (2,5) to advance toward (0,5).  \n- **Turn 64**: Move LEFT to (1,5) if safe (check enemy positions and board).  \n- **Turn 65**: Move LEFT to (0,5) to eat apple (grow to 14 apples).  \n- Post-apple: Descend left edge (e.g., (0,5) \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 (0,3) \u2192 (0,2) \u2192 (0,1) \u2192 (0,0)) to access (2,0) via (1,0) or (2,0) directly if pathable. Then target (1,3) and (1,2) via (1,x) moves. Avoid row 2 (enemy body) and monitor enemy movement.  \n\nLEFT",

Highest priority.  \n- **DOWN (to (1,4))**: Positions for (1,3) next turn (distance=1), but delays (0,5).  \n- **UP (to (1,6))**: Moves away from all apples (increases distance). Poor for growth.  \n\n**Future Move Flexibility:**  \n- **LEFT (to (0,5))**: Next turn: UP (to (0,6)) or DOWN (to (0,4)) available. Aligns with long-term descent plan (left edge to (0,0)).  \n- **DOWN (to (1,4))**: Next turn: DOWN (to (1,3)/apple), LEFT (to (0,4)), RIGHT (to (2,4)) available. However, delays (0,5) collection.  \n- **UP (to (1,6))**: Next turn: UP (to (1,7)), LEFT (to (0,6)), RIGHT (to (2,6)) available, but moves away from apple cluster.  \n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1) Behavior:**  \n- Enemy focused on bottom/mid-board (moves to (4,3) or (3,4)). Distant from left apples (min. 4+ moves to (0,5)), giving uncontested access.  \n\n**Risk Assessment:**  \n- All moves safe with no head-on collision risk.  \n- UP eliminated: Moves away from apples, reduces growth opportunity.  \n- DOWN viable but defers (0,5) collection, risking enemy interference long-term.  \n- LEFT secures immediate growth and maintains strategic descent path.  \n\n**Long-Term Plan for Next Turns:**  \n- **Turn 65**: Move LEFT to (0,5) to eat apple (grow to 14 apples).  \n- **Turn 66**: Move DOWN to (0,4) to descend left edge.  \n- **Turn 67**: Move DOWN to (0,3).  \n- **Turn 68**: Move DOWN to (0,2).  \n- **Turn 69**: Move RIGHT to (1,2) to eat apple (if available).  \n- **Post-apple**: Continue descent to (0,0), then target (2,0) via (1,0).  \n- Collect (1,3) opportunistically during descent if path clears.  \n\nLEFT",

Distances to other apples increase slightly, but (6,7) is a viable target.  \n- **DOWN (to (0,4))**: Moves closer to (1,3) (distance decreases from 3 to 2) and (1,2) (from 4 to 3). However, enemy snake #1 is near (2,4) and may contest these apples, increasing risk in future turns.  \n- Prioritize minimizing risk given our apple lead (14 vs 13). UP avoids immediate conflict and aligns with safer path.  \n\n**Future Move Flexibility:**  \n- **UP (to (0,6))**: Next turn, moves: UP (to (0,7)) or RIGHT (to (1,6)) available. Avoids congestion near bottom and enemy. Opens path to top-right apples (e.g., (6,7)).  \n- **DOWN (to (0,4))**: Next turn, moves: RIGHT (to (1,4)) or DOWN (to (0,3)) available.

UP keeps us near the edge but delays core objective.  \n- Sticking to the pre-planned route (RIGHT then UP) ensures consistency and leverages our apple lead for low-risk growth.  \n\n**Long-Term Plan for Next Turns:**  \n- **Turn 67**: Move RIGHT to (1,6) to initiate eastward path.  \n- **Turn 68**: Move UP to (1,7) to avoid body at (1,5) and align vertically.  \n- **Turn 69**: Move RIGHT to (2,7).  \n- **Turn 70-72**: Continue RIGHT to (3,7), (4,7), (5,7).  \n- **Turn 73**: Move RIGHT to (6,7) to eat apple.  \n- Monitor enemy movements: if enemy threatens (6,7), adjust via (1,7)\u2192(1,8)\u2192east.

Deadly. Eliminated.  \n- **RIGHT (to (2,6))**: On board. Cell (2,6) is empty ('.' on board). Not occupied by any snake body. Safe.  \n\nSafe options: UP, RIGHT.  \n\n**Head-on Collision Risk (Simultaneous Moves):**  \n- Enemy snake #1 head at (2,3) can move to: UP (2,4), DOWN (2,2), or LEFT (1,3) (RIGHT to (3,3) is blocked by its own body).  \n- Our moves: (1,7) for UP, (2,6) for RIGHT.  \n- No overlap with enemy possible moves \u2192 both UP and RIGHT are head-on collision safe.  \n\n**Apple Proximity and Growth Opportunity:**  \nApples at: (2,0), (5,0), (1,2), (1,3), (6,7).  \n- **UP (to (1,7))**: Moves toward (6,7) (Manhattan distance decreases from 7 to 6). Also maintains vertical alignment for eastward path to (6,7). Avoids descending into contested area near (1,2)/(1,3) where enemy is active.  \n- **RIGHT (to (2,6))**: Also moves toward (6,7) (distance decreases from 7 to 6). However, positions closer to enemy territory (enemy head at (2,3)) without immediate benefit, as (1,2)/(1,3) are risky.  \n- Prioritize (6,7) for uncontested growth. UP aligns with planned route and leverages apple lead (14 vs 13) by avoiding conflict.  \n\n**Future Move Flexibility:**  \n- **UP (to (1,7))**: Next turn, moves: UP (to (1,8)), LEFT (to (0,7)), or RIGHT (to (2,7)) available. Avoids congestion near body segments and maintains central path options.  \n- **RIGHT (to (2,6))**: Next turn, moves: UP (to (2,7)) or RIGHT (to (3,6)) available. DOWN and LEFT are blocked by own body, reducing options.  \nUP offers superior flexibility (3 safe follow-ups vs 2 for RIGHT).  \n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1) Behavior:**  \n- Enemy is likely targeting apples at (1,2)/(1,3) (can reach via LEFT to (1,3)). Moving UP keeps us away from this conflict zone. RIGHT positions us closer to enemy head (distance 3) without tactical advantage.  \n\n**Risk Assessment:**  \n- Both moves are immediately safe. UP minimizes exposure to enemy by ascending away from their trajectory and maintains distance. RIGHT risks potential future entanglement near enemy path.  \n- Sticking to the pre-planned route (UP then RIGHT) ensures consistency and leverages our apple lead for low-risk growth toward (6,7).  \n\n**Long-Term Plan for Next Turns:**  \n- **Turn 68**: Move UP to (1,7) to continue planned path.  \n- **Turn 69**: Move RIGHT to (2,7) to advance eastward.  \n- **Turns 70-72**: Continue RIGHT to (3,7), (4,7), (5,7).  \n- **Turn 73**: Move RIGHT to (6,7) to eat apple.  \n- **Contingency**: If enemy threatens (6,7), divert north via (5,7) \u2192 (5,8) \u2192 (6,8) \u2192 DOWN to (6,7).

This apple is critical\u2014we can eat it next turn to reach 15 apples and close the gap (enemy has 16). Enemy is far away (distance 9+), so (6,7) is uncontested.  \n- **UP (to (4,8))**: Increases distance to (6,7) (from 2 to 3) and moves away from all apples. No growth benefit.  \n- **DOWN (to (4,6))**: Increases distance to (6,7) (from 2 to 3). Apples at (2,0)/(5,0) are distant (8+ steps) and likely targeted by enemy (closer at (2,1)). Low growth potential.  \nPrioritize RIGHT to secure (6,7) immediately.  \n\n**Future Move Flexibility:**  \n- **RIGHT (to (5,7))**: Next turn, moves: UP (to (5,8)), DOWN (to (5,6)), or RIGHT (to (6,7)) available. Avoids dead-ends and aligns with apple path. After eating (6,7), exit via UP (to (6,8)) or RIGHT (to (7,7)) for flexibility.  \n- **UP (to (4,8))**: Next turn, DOWN blocked by own body (will be at (4,7)). Moves: UP (to (4,9)), LEFT (to (3,8)), RIGHT (to (5,8)) available.

Only LEFT (to (3,6)) or RIGHT (to (5,6)) available. High dead-end risk and traps us away from apples.  \nRIGHT offers best flexibility and progression.  \n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1) Behavior:**  \n- Enemy likely targets bottom apples (e.g., (2,0) via DOWN or (0,1) via LEFT). They pose no threat to (6,7) due to distance. Focus on securing (6,7) to gain ground.  \n\n**Risk Assessment:**  \n- All moves are immediately safe. RIGHT minimizes risk by progressing toward an uncontested apple and avoiding positions with limited future moves. DOWN risks trapping us with only two options next turn. UP provides no advantage and delays growth.  \n- Path to (6,7) is clear: (5,7) \u2192 (6,7) next turn. Board shows '.' at (5,7) and (6,7) (apple cell is safe to enter).  \n\n**Long-Term Plan for Next Turns:**  \n- **Turn 72**: Move RIGHT to (5,7) to position for (6,7) apple.  \n- **Turn 73**: Move RIGHT to (6,7) to eat apple (grow to 15 apples). If blocked (unlikely), use UP/DOWN alternatives.  \n- **Post-Apple Plan**: After eating, exit (6,7) via UP (to (6,8)) or RIGHT (to (7,7)) to avoid trapping. Then target top apples (e.g., (8,1) via south or (6,7) area if new apples spawn). Monitor enemy\u2014if they eat bottom apples, we can focus on central/north areas.  \n- **Contingency**: If enemy approaches (e.g., via (5,0)), divert north via (5,7) \u2192 (5,8) \u2192 (6,8) \u2192 DOWN to (6,7) if needed.  \n\nRIGHT",

High dead-end risk and traps us away from apples.  \nRIGHT offers growth and a clear escape path (UP/RIGHT next turn), while UP/DOWN provide no growth and risk inferior positioning.  \n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1) Behavior:**  \n- Enemy likely targets bottom apples: (1,0) via LEFT or (5,0) via future moves. Poses no threat to (6,7). Focus on securing (6,7) to gain ground.  \n\n**Risk Assessment:**  \n- All moves are immediately safe. RIGHT minimizes risk by securing an uncontested apple and avoiding positions with limited future moves. UP/DOWN risk delaying growth and trapping us.  \n- Path to (6,7) is clear: no obstacles. After eating, escape via (6,8) or (7,7) is viable.  \n\n**Long-Term Plan for Next Turns:**  \n- **Turn 73**: Move RIGHT to (6,7) to eat apple (grow to 15 apples).  \n- **Turn 74**: Exit (6,7) via UP (to (6,8)) or RIGHT (to (7,7)), whichever is safe. Prioritize UP to access top rows.  \n- **Post-Apple Plan**: Target (8,1) apple: route south via (7,7) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 ... or east/north via (6,8) \u2192 (6,9) \u2192 (7,9) \u2192 south. Monitor enemy\u2014if they eat bottom apples, focus on central/north areas.  \n- **Contingency**: If enemy approaches central area, divert north via (6,8) \u2192 (5,8) \u2192 east. Avoid re-entering body cluster.  \n\nRIGHT",

Not occupied by any snake body at start. Safe.  \n\nSafe options: UP, RIGHT.  \n\n**Head-on Collision Risk (Simultaneous Moves):**  \n- Enemy snake #1 head at (1,0) can move to: UP (to (1,1)) or LEFT (to (0,0)) (DOWN off-board, RIGHT into own body).  \n- Our moves: (6,8) for UP, (7,7) for RIGHT.  \n- No overlap with enemy's possible moves \u2192 both moves are head-on collision safe.  \n\n**Apple Proximity and Growth Opportunity:**  \nApples at: (5,0), (0,1), (8,1), (0,2), (2,4).  \n- **RIGHT (to (7,7))**: Moves closer to (8,1) (Manhattan distance reduces from 8 to 7). (8,1) is uncontested\u2014enemy at (1,0) is 8+ steps away. Provides a path to target (8,1) via future moves.  \n- **UP (to (6,8))**: Moves away from all apples. Increases distance to (8,1) to 9 and (2,4) to 8. No immediate growth opportunity.  \nPrioritize RIGHT to advance toward (8,1) and maintain growth potential.  \n\n**Future Move Flexibility:**  \n- **RIGHT (to (7,7))**: Next turn moves: UP (to (7,8)), DOWN (to (7,6)), RIGHT (to (8,7)) available. Avoids dead-ends and provides multiple escape routes. Positions to navigate around enemy body in row 4.  \n- **UP (to (6,8))**: Next turn moves: UP (to (6,9)), LEFT (to (5,8)), RIGHT (to (7,8)) available. However, risks trapping in top-left corner away from apples, with limited southward paths blocked by own body.  \nRIGHT offers better flexibility and aligns with apple targeting.  \n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1) Behavior:**  \n- Enemy likely targets bottom apples: (0,1) or (5,0) via UP/LEFT moves. Poses no threat to (8,1) area. Focus on securing (8,1) to gain ground.  \n\n**Risk Assessment:**  \n- Both moves are immediately safe. RIGHT minimizes risk by moving away from body cluster and avoiding positions with limited future moves. UP risks isolation in low-apple area.  \n- Path to (8,1) is viable: RIGHT enables a route via (7,7) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (7,5) \u2192 (8,5) \u2192 ...

Safe.  \n- **LEFT (to (6,7))**: Occupied by own body segment (at (6,7)). Moving into own body is deadly. Eliminated.  \n- **RIGHT (to (8,7))**: On board. Cell (8,7) is empty ('.' on row 7). Not occupied by any snake body at start. Safe.  \n\nSafe options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n**Head-on Collision Risk (Simultaneous Moves):**  \n- Enemy snake #1 head at (0,0) must move UP to (0,1) (only safe move; DOWN/LEFT off-board, RIGHT into own body).  \n- Our moves: (7,8) for UP, (7,6) for DOWN, (8,7) for RIGHT.  \n- No overlap with enemy's move to (0,1) \u2192 all moves are head-on collision safe.  \n\n**Apple Proximity and Growth Opportunity:**  \nApples at: (5,0), (0,1) [will be eaten by enemy], (8,1), (0,2), (2,4).  \n- **DOWN (to (7,6))**: Reduces Manhattan distance to (8,1) (from 7 to 6), (2,4) (from 8 to 7), (5,0) (from 9 to 8), and (0,2) (from 12 to 11). Best for multi-apple targeting.  \n- **RIGHT (to (8,7))**: Reduces distance to (8,1) (from 7 to 6) but increases distance to (2,4) (from 8 to 9) and others. Less versatile.  \n- **UP (to (7,8))**: Increases distance to all apples (e.g., (8,1) from 7 to 8). No growth benefit.  \nPrioritize DOWN to advance toward multiple apples efficiently.  \n\n**Future Move Flexibility:**  \n- **DOWN (to (7,6))**: Next turn moves: UP (to (7,7) but occupied by new body \u2192 unsafe), DOWN (to (7,5)), LEFT (to (6,6)), RIGHT (to (8,6)). All except UP are empty and safe \u2192 3 options. Positions well for descent toward apples and avoids top-left body cluster.  \n- **RIGHT (to (8,7))**: Next turn moves: UP (to (8,8)), DOWN (to (8,6)), RIGHT (to (9,7)). LEFT (to (7,7) occupied by new body \u2192 unsafe). 3 options, but may face enemy body blockades near row 4.  \n- **UP (to (7,8))**: Next turn moves: UP (to (7,9)), LEFT (to (6,8)), RIGHT (to (8,8)). DOWN (to (7,7) occupied by new body \u2192 unsafe). 3 options, but isolates in low-apple area.  \nDOWN offers balanced flexibility and aligns with apple targeting.  \n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1) Behavior:**  \n- Enemy moves to (0,1) to eat apple, growing longer. Focused on bottom-left apples (e.g., (0,2), (5,0)), leaving (8,1) and (2,4) less contested. Minimal threat to our path if we descend.  \n\n**Risk Assessment:**  \n- All moves immediately safe. DOWN minimizes risk by moving away from body cluster and enemy head, with open descent paths. RIGHT risks dead-end near enemy body in row 4. UP risks isolation.  \n- Path to apples: DOWN enables route to (2,4) via leftward descent (e.g., (7,6) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (5,6) \u2192 ...), monitoring tail shifts. (8,1) may be blocked by enemy body long-term, so (2,4) is primary target.  \n\n**Long-Term Plan for Next Turns:**  \n- **Turn 75**: Move DOWN to (7,6) to position for (2,4) pursuit.  \n- **Turn 76**: Move LEFT to (6,6) if safe (avoiding body), else DOWN/RIGHT. Prioritize LEFT to start traversing toward (2,4).  \n- **Apple Targeting**: Route to (2,4) via (6,6) \u2192 (5,6) \u2192 (4,6) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 (2,5) once tail clears (in ~4 turns) \u2192 (2,4). If blocked, divert to (5,0) via southward moves.  \n- **Contingency**: If enemy approaches (2,4), shift to (8,1) via east/south paths or target new apples. Avoid re-entering body cluster.  \n\nDOWN",

Safe.  \n\nSafe options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Head-on Collision Risk (Simultaneous Moves):**  \n- Enemy snake #1 head at (0,1) has safe moves: UP (to (0,2) for apple) or RIGHT (to (1,1)). Likely moves UP to eat apple.  \n- Our moves: (7,5) for DOWN, (6,6) for LEFT, (8,6) for RIGHT. None overlap with enemy's potential moves \u2192 all head-on collision safe.  \n\n**Apple Proximity and Growth Opportunity:**  \nApples at: (5,0), (8,1), (2,4), (5,2) [after enemy eats (0,2)].  \n- **DOWN (to (7,5))**: Manhattan distance to (5,0): 7, (8,1): 5, (2,4): 6, (5,2): 5. Reduces distance to (8,1) and (5,2).  \n- **LEFT (to (6,6))**: Distances: (5,0): 7, (8,1): 7, (2,4): 6, (5,2): 5. Only reduces distance to (5,2).  \n- **RIGHT (to (8,6))**: Distances: (5,0): 9, (8,1): 5, (2,4): 8, (5,2): 7. Reduces distance to (8,1) but increases to others.  \nDOWN and RIGHT offer apple proximity, but DOWN targets two apples. However, paths to apples are blocked by enemy body in rows 4-5 (e.g., (7,4), (6,4), (5,4)). RIGHT positions better for accessing open areas.  \n\n**Future Move Flexibility:**  \n- **DOWN (to (7,5))**: Next turn moves: UP (to (7,6) \u2192 own body, unsafe), DOWN (to (7,4) \u2192 enemy body, unsafe), LEFT (to (6,5)), RIGHT (to (8,5)). Only 2 safe options. Risk of dead-end near enemy body.  \n- **LEFT (to (6,6))**: Next turn moves: UP (to (6,7) \u2192 own body, unsafe), DOWN (to (6,5)), LEFT (to (5,6)), RIGHT (to (7,6) \u2192 own body, unsafe).

Minimal threat in top-right.  \n\n**Risk Assessment:**  \n- DOWN and LEFT risk immediate dead-ends due to enemy body and limited next moves.  \n- RIGHT moves away from body clusters and enemy territory, maximizing open space for evasion and future apple targeting.  \n\n**Long-Term Plan for Next Turns:**  \n- **Turn 76**: Move RIGHT to (8,6) to escape crowded area and access open top-right.  \n- **Turn 77**: From (8,6), move UP to (8,7) to continue toward safe zone (rows 8-9).  \n- **Apple Targeting**: Prioritize new apple spawns in top-right. If accessible, consider (8,1) via cautious descent (e.g., (8,6) \u2192 (8,5) \u2192 (8,4) only if enemy body clears). Avoid bottom rows until paths open.  \n- **Contingency**: If enemy blocks top-right, traverse left along rows 8-9 to column 0. Monitor tail movement to re-enter center when safe.  \n\nRIGHT",

Not occupied by any snake body (own or enemy). Safe.  \n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: On board. Cell (8,5) is empty ('.' on row 5, column 8). Not occupied by any snake body. Safe.  \n- **LEFT (to (7,6))**: Occupied by own body segment (the neck, immediately behind head). Moving backwards into own body is deadly. Eliminated.  \n- **RIGHT (to (9,6))**: On board. Cell (9,6) is empty ('.' on row 6, column 9). Not occupied by any snake body. Safe.  \n\n**Safe options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.**  \n\n**Head-on Collision Risk (Simultaneous Moves):**  \n- Enemy snake #1 head at (0,2) has only one safe move: UP to (0,3) (since DOWN to (0,1) and RIGHT to (1,2) hit its own body, and LEFT is off-board). Enemy will likely move UP to (0,3) to avoid death.  \n- Our potential moves: (8,7) for UP, (8,5) for DOWN, (9,6) for RIGHT.  \n- All are far from (0,3) (minimum Manhattan distance 8), so no overlap or head-on collision risk. All moves are head-on collision safe.  \n\n**Apple Proximity and Growth Opportunity:**  \nApples at: (5,0), (8,1), (2,4), (5,2), (5,3). Moving to any of our safe cells does not eat an apple (no apple at (8,7), (8,5), or (9,6)). Thus, no growth this turn.  \n- **UP (to (8,7))**: Increases Manhattan distance to all apples (e.g., (8,1) from 5 to 6, (5,3) from 6 to 7). Worse for apple proximity.  \n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**: Reduces distance to (8,1) (from 5 to 4) and (5,3) (from 6 to 5). Better for apple targeting.  \n- **RIGHT (to (9,6))**: Increases distance to all apples (e.g., (8,1) from 5 to 6, (5,3) from 6 to 7). Worse for apple proximity.  \nDOWN is best for apple proximity, but paths to apples (e.g., (8,1)) are blocked by enemy body in rows 0-4 (e.g., (8,4) is enemy body). Accessing apples requires enemy body to clear, which is uncertain.  \n\n**Future Move Flexibility (Next Turn Options):**  \n- **UP (to (8,7))**:  \n  - Next head position: (8,7).  \n  - Potential moves: UP to (8,8) (empty), DOWN to (8,6) (own body, deadly), LEFT to (7,7) (own body, deadly), RIGHT to (9,7) (empty).  \n  - Safe next moves: UP and RIGHT (2 options). Accesses top rows (8-9), which are mostly empty, offering more space.  \n- **DOWN (to (8,5))**:  \n  - Next head position: (8,5).  \n  - Potential moves: UP to (8,6) (own body, deadly), DOWN to (8,4) (enemy body at (8,4), deadly), LEFT to (7,5) (empty), RIGHT to (9,5) (empty).  \n  - Safe next moves: LEFT and RIGHT (2 options). Limited by enemy body below (row 4) and own body above, risking dead-ends.  \n- **RIGHT (to (9,6))**:  \n  - Next head position: (9,6).  \n  - Potential moves: UP to (9,7) (empty), DOWN to (9,5) (empty), LEFT to (8,6) (own body, deadly), RIGHT off-board (deadly).  \n  - Safe next moves: UP and DOWN (2 options). Edge position reduces flexibility; fewer escape routes.  \nUP provides better long-term flexibility by moving toward the open top-right (rows 8-9), which has ample space for evasion and future apple targeting. DOWN and RIGHT offer similar immediate flexibility but in riskier areas near enemy territory.  \n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1) Behavior:**  \n- Enemy will move UP to (0,3) to survive (only safe option). No apple eaten, so no growth. Their body dominates rows 0-4, blocking access to bottom apples ((5,0), (8,1), (2,4), (5,2), (5,3)). They pose minimal threat in the top-right, allowing us to exploit that area.  \n\n**Risk Assessment:**  \n- DOWN risks entrapment near enemy body (e.g., row 4 blocked) and offers no safe path to apples short-term.  \n- RIGHT positions us on the edge with limited future moves.  \n- UP moves away from crowded areas, reducing immediate risk and aligning with the long-term plan to access safe zones.  \n\n**Long-Term Plan for Next Turns:**  \n- **Turn 77**: Move UP to (8,7) to continue toward the safe top-right (rows 8-9), as per previous rationale.  \n- **Turn 78**: From (8,7), move UP to (8,8) or RIGHT to (9,7) to maximize open space. Prioritize row 8-9 movement to avoid enemy.  \n- **Apple Targeting**: Monitor new apple spawns in top rows (currently empty, high spawn probability). If accessible, consider (8,1) via cautious descent only if enemy body clears (e.g., via tail movement). Avoid bottom rows until paths open.  \n- **Contingency**: If enemy encroaches top-right, traverse left along rows 8-9 toward column 0. Leverage open space for evasion and apple collection to close score gap (15 vs 20 apples).  \n\nUP",

No head-on collision risk.  \n\n**Apple Proximity:**  \nApples at: (5,0), (8,1), (2,4), (5,2), (5,3).  \n- **UP (to (8,9))**: Closest apple (8,1) at Manhattan distance 8.  \n- **LEFT (to (7,8))**: Closest apple (5,3) at Manhattan distance 7.  \n- **RIGHT (to (9,8))**: Closest apple (8,1) at Manhattan distance 8.  \nLEFT is closer to an apple (5,3), but reaching it requires navigating through body-blocked rows (7,6,5), making it unsafe in the short term. UP and RIGHT maintain distance but align with safer top-row positioning.  \n\n**Future Move Flexibility (Next Turn Options):**  \n- **UP (to (8,9))**:  \n  - Safe moves: LEFT to (7,9) (empty), RIGHT to (9,9) (empty). UP off-board (deadly), DOWN to (8,8) hits own body (deadly).  \n  - Accesses row 9 (fully empty), maximizing potential for new apple spawns.  \n- **LEFT (to (7,8))**:  \n  - Safe moves: UP to (7,9) (empty), LEFT to (6,8) (empty). DOWN to (7,7) hits own body (deadly), RIGHT to (8,8) hits own body (deadly).  \n  - Keeps us in row 8, with access to row 9 via UP.  \n- **RIGHT (to (9,8))**:  \n  - Safe moves: UP to (9,9) (empty), DOWN to (9,7) (empty). LEFT to (8,8) hits own body (deadly), RIGHT off-board (deadly).  \n  - Traps us on the right edge with limited lateral movement.  \nUP and LEFT offer better flexibility by accessing row 9 and avoiding edges. UP specifically opens a new row (9) for exploration.  \n\n**Long-Term Strategy:**  \n- **Apple Focus**: Current apples are in high-risk areas (bottom rows blocked by enemy and body). Prioritize positioning for potential new apple spawns in top rows (8-9), which are mostly empty. Avoid descending until body clears or apples spawn nearby.  \n- **Score Gap**: Trail 15 vs 20 apples. Exploit open top rows to collect new apples safely and close the gap.  \n- **Enemy Avoidance**: Enemy (#1) dominates bottom rows (0-4). Stay in rows 8-9 to minimize interaction.  \n- **Contingency**: If an apple spawns in row 9, prioritize it immediately. Otherwise, traverse left/right along rows 8-9 to maintain space and avoid dead-ends. Monitor enemy movement\u2014if it ascends, use row 9 as an evasion corridor.  \n\n**Decision**:  \nAll safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) avoid immediate death. UP is preferred:  \n- Aligns with long-term plan to exploit row 9 for potential new apples.  \n- Provides access to a fully empty row, improving future flexibility over LEFT and RIGHT.  \n- Maintains safe distance from enemy and body blocks, reducing entrapment risk.  \n\nUP",
