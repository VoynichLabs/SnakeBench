No, (1, 0) is empty, safe\n- **LEFT to (0, 1)**: Empty, safe\n- **RIGHT to (2, 1)**: Empty, safe\n\nAll four directions appear safe immediately. Now I need to evaluate which is strategically best.\n\n**Long-term thinking:**\n- I need to collect apples efficiently\n- Nearby apples: (3, 0) is 2 moves away (RIGHT, DOWN), (8, 1) is 7 moves away (all RIGHT), (5, 4) is far, (2, 9) is far, (1, 9) is far\n- The apple at (3, 0) is closest\n- I should avoid getting trapped or limiting my options\n\n**Evaluating each move:**\n- **UP (1,2)**: Moves toward center/top, keeps options open, path to (3,0) would be DOWN, LEFT, LEFT... not ideal\n- **DOWN (1,0)**: This is on bottom edge. From (1,0), I could go RIGHT to (2,0), then (3,0) for the apple. But being on the edge reduces future mobility.\n- **LEFT (0,1)**: On left edge, limits mobility, away from the closest apple at (3,0)\n- **RIGHT (2,1)**: Good - moves toward apple at (3,0), keeps central mobility, from there can go DOWN to (2,0) then RIGHT to (3,0)\n\nThe apple at (3,0) is the most immediate target. Moving RIGHT from (1,1) to (2,1) puts me in a good position to reach it in two more moves (DOWN to (2,0), RIGHT to (3,0)). This path maintains flexibility and doesn't immediately trap me against an edge.\n\nEnemy snake is at (6,8) - far away, not an immediate threat.\n\n**Strategy for next few turns:**\nHead toward apple at (3,0) via (2,1) -> (2,0) -> (3,0).

Moreover, moving DOWN brings the head nearer to the (5,4) apple, which is the closest apple in terms of vertical progress.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan:**  \nMove DOWN to (6,7).

To get to (8, 1), I need to move RIGHT.\nHowever, the immediate target is the apple at (4, 6) relative to my position, or the one at (8, 1).\nWait, looking at the apples again: (8, 1), (2, 9), (5, 4), (1, 9), (4, 6).\nFrom (3, 0):\n- Distance to (4, 6): |4-3| + |6-0| = 7\n- Distance to (8, 1): |8-3| + |1-0| = 6\n- Distance to (1, 9): |1-3| + |9-0| = 11\n\nActually, there is an apple listed at (4, 6) and one at (8, 1).\nBut wait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt:\n`4 . . . . . A . . . .`\nRow 4 (y=4) has an 'A' at column 5? No, let's check the coordinates again.\n`9 . A A . . . . . . .` -> Apples at (1,9) and (2,9)\n`6 . . . . A 0 . . . .` -> Apple at (4,6), Enemy at (5,6)\n`4 . . . . . A . . . .` -> Apple at (5,4)\n`1 . . . . . . . . A .` -> Apple at (8,1)\n\nSo the apples match the list.\n\nFrom (3, 0), moving **UP** gets me closer to (4, 6) and (5, 4).\nFrom (3, 0), moving **RIGHT** gets me closer to (8, 1) and (5, 4).\n\nLet's check the enemy snake #0 at (5, 6). It is far away. It moved UP last turn. It might be going for the apple at (5, 4) or (4, 6).\n\nIf I move **UP to (3, 1)**:\n- I am moving towards the cluster of apples at (4, 6) and (5, 4).\n- This path seems reasonable.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (4, 0)**:\n- I am moving towards the apple at (8, 1).\n- However, (8, 1) is far.\n\nLet's look at the board state again. Is there any immediate danger?\nThe enemy is at (5, 6). It is 6 units away Manhattan distance.\nIf I move UP, I go to (3, 1).\nIf I move RIGHT, I go to (4, 0).\n\nIs there any reason to avoid UP? No.\nIs there any reason to avoid RIGHT? No.\n\nHowever, I should look at the apples. (4, 6) and (5, 4) are relatively close. (8, 1) is close too.\nWait, (8, 1) is only 5 steps away from (3, 0) if I go RIGHT then UP. (3,0) -> (4,0) -> (5,0) -> (6,0) -> (7,0) -> (8,0) -> (8,1). That's 6 moves. Or (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (4,1) -> (5,1)... no.\n\nLet's calculate Manhattan distances carefully from (3, 0):\n1. (8, 1): |8-3| + |1-0| = 5 + 1 = 6\n2. (4, 6): |4-3| + |6-0| = 1 + 6 = 7\n3. (5, 4): |5-3| + |4-0| = 2 + 4 = 6\n4. (2, 9): |2-3| + |9-0| = 1 + 9 = 10\n5. (1, 9): |1-3| + |9-0| = 2 + 9 = 11\n\nSo (8, 1) and (5, 4) are equidistant (6 steps). (4, 6) is 7 steps.\n\nWhere is the enemy? (5, 6). He is likely going for (5, 4) or (4, 6).\nIf the enemy goes for (5, 4), he is distance |5-5| + |4-6| = 2.\nIf he goes for (4, 6), he is |4-5| + |6-6| = 1.\nIf he goes for (8, 1), he is |8-5| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8.\n\nSo the enemy is very close to (4, 6) and (5, 4).\nI am at (3, 0). The enemy is at (5, 6).\nI should probably go for (8, 1) because the enemy is contesting the other apples.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (4, 0)**, I move towards (8, 1).\nIf I go **UP to (3, 1)**, I move towards (4, 6)/(5, 4), where the enemy is.\n\nAlso, note the apple at (2, 9) and (1, 9). They are far but maybe available later.\n\nLet's consider the geometry. The board is 10x10.\nMy head: (3, 0).\nIf I move RIGHT: (4, 0).\nIf I move UP: (3, 1).\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I am on the bottom edge. I can move UP next turn.\nIf I move UP, I am moving into the board.\n\nThe enemy is at (5, 6). If I go UP, I might run into him if he comes down.\nThe enemy likely wants to eat (4, 6) or (5, 4).\nIf he eats (4, 6), he moves to (4, 6).\nIf he eats (5, 4), he moves to (5, 4).\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (4, 0):\n- Next turn I can go UP to (4, 1), then (4, 2)... to get to (8, 1).\n- (8, 1) is on row 1. So I need to go to y=1.\n\nLet's look at the board state at y=1:\nRow 1: `. . . . . . . . A .`\nSo (8, 1) is an apple.\n\nIf I go RIGHT now:\n- I am at (4, 0).\n- Next turn I can go UP to (4, 1).\n- Then I can go RIGHT to (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1).\n- This seems like a safe path along the edge/bottom.\n\nIf I go UP now:\n- I am at (3, 1).\n- I can go RIGHT to (4, 1).\n- Or UP to (3, 2).\n\nWhy would I go UP?\nIf I want to intercept the enemy or go for (5, 4).\nBut the enemy is already at (5, 6). He has the advantage for (4, 6) and (5, 4).\n\nWhy would I go RIGHT?\nTo get (8, 1). This apple seems less contested.\n\nLet's check if (8, 1) is safe.\nThe board at row 1: `. . . . . . . . A .`\nNo obstacles there.\n\nIs there any other apple closer?\n(3, 0) was eaten. (5, 4) and (4, 6) are contested.\n(8, 1) is the best bet.\n\nWait, is there an apple at (3, 0)? No, I just ate it. The prompt says \"Apples at: (8, 1), (2, 9), (5, 4), (1, 9), (4, 6)\".\nSo (3, 0) is NOT in the list.\n\nLet's double check the prompt:\n\"Apples at: (8, 1), (2, 9), (5, 4), (1, 9), (4, 6)\"\nYes.\n\nSo, I am at (3, 0). I want to get an apple.\nPath to (8, 1):\n(3, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (4, 1) -> (5, 1) -> (6, 1) -> (7, 1) -> (8, 1).\nThis is 6 moves.\n\nPath to (5, 4):\n(3, 0) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (5, 4).\nThis is 6 moves.\n\nPath to (4, 6):\n(3, 0) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 5) -> (4, 6).\nThis is 7 moves.\n\nSo (8, 1) and (5, 4) are equidistant.\nHowever, the enemy is at (5, 6). He is distance 2 from (5, 4) and 1 from (4, 6).\nHe will likely eat (4, 6) this turn or next.\nIf he eats (4, 6), he grows. Then he might go for (5, 4).\n\nIf I go for (5, 4), I risk a collision with the enemy.\nIf I go for (8, 1), I am alone.\n\nAlso, I am at the bottom edge. Moving RIGHT keeps me at the bottom edge. This is usually safe because I don't have to worry about the \"down\" direction.\nIf I move UP, I open up the \"down\" direction (which goes off board anyway) and \"up\" (safe). But moving along the edge is good.\n\nLet's verify safety of moves from (3, 0):\n- UP to (3, 1): Empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (4, 0): Empty. Safe.\n\nIs there any trap?\nIf I go UP to (3, 1), I might be moving into a position where the enemy can cut me off.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 0), I am moving towards the open space.\n\nOne detail: The enemy moved UP last turn. From (5, 7) to (5, 6).\nHe is on the same X column as (5, 4).\nHe will likely continue to (5, 5), (5, 4) or go to (4, 6).\nIf he goes to (4, 6), he will be at (4, 6).\nFrom (4, 6), he might go to (4, 5), etc.\n\nIf I am at (4, 0), I am far away.\n\nConsider the apple at (2, 9) and (1, 9).\nThese are at the top left.\nIf I go UP now, I am moving towards them?\n(3, 0) -> (3, 1) -> ...\nDistance to (2, 9) is 10. To (1, 9) is 11.\nDistance from (4, 0) to (2, 9) is |2-4| + |9-0| = 11.\nSo going UP is slightly better for those, but they are very far.\n\nThe short term goal is to get the next apple safely.\n(8, 1) seems safest.\n(5, 4) is risky because of enemy #0.\n\nDecision: Move RIGHT to (4, 0).\nThis aligns with the path to (8, 1).\nIt keeps me on the bottom edge (safe).\nIt avoids the enemy's territory (top center).\n\nWait, I should check if the enemy can reach (8, 1).\nEnemy is at (5, 6). Distance to (8, 1) is |8-5| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8.\nI am at (3, 0). Distance is 6.\nI have the advantage for (8, 1).\n\nSo, RIGHT is the move.\n\nLet's double check the board state one more time.\nBoard:\nRow 0: `. . T 1 . . . . . .` (My head at 3, tail at 2)\nRow 6: `. . . . A 0 . . . .` (Enemy at 5, 6)\nRow 4: `. . . . . A . . . .` (Apple at 5, 4)\nRow 1: `. . . . . . . . A .` (Apple at 8, 1)\n\nMy head (3, 0).\nUP: (3, 1) is `.` (Row 1 has A at 8, so (3, 1) is empty).\nRIGHT: (4, 0) is `.` (Row 0 has T at 2, 1 at 3, so 4 is empty).\n\nBoth are safe.\nStrategic preference is RIGHT.\n\nOne small check: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nMy head is (3, 0). My body is (2, 0).\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 0), I die.\nDOWN is off board.\nSo UP and RIGHT are the only legal moves.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer UP?\nMaybe to get to (4, 6) faster? No, (8, 1) is as close/easier.\nThe enemy is clearly contesting the apples in the top half (5, 6).\nI should stay in the bottom half or go to the right side.\n\nMoving RIGHT keeps my options open. I can go UP next turn, or continue RIGHT.\nMoving UP locks me into the left side a bit more? No, I can still turn right.\n\nActually, from (4, 0) (if I move RIGHT), I can go UP to (4, 1) or continue RIGHT to (5, 0).\nFrom (3, 1) (if I move UP), I can go RIGHT to (4, 1) or UP to (3, 2).\n\nIt's a close call but the \"avoid the enemy\" rule suggests RIGHT.\nThe enemy is at (5, 6). He is likely heading to (5, 4) or (4, 6).\nI am at (3, 0). If I go RIGHT, I am moving away from him (in X direction) and slightly towards him in Y? No, (8, 1) is Right and Up.\n(4, 0) -> (5, 0) -> (6, 0) -> (7, 0) -> (8, 0) -> (8, 1).\nThis is a very safe path along the bottom and right wall.\n\nIf I go UP:\n(3, 1) -> (4, 1) -> ...\nThis moves me into the central area.\n\nI will choose RIGHT.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nHead towards the apple at (8, 1) along the bottom/right edge. Avoid the enemy snake at (5, 6) who seems to be targeting the central apples at (4, 6) and (5, 4). Maintain distance from enemy.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "First, I need to analyze the current board state and determine the safest and most strategic move for my snake (ID 1). My snake's head is at (5, 2), and its body is at (5, 1). There are apples at (8, 1), (2, 9), (1, 9), (9, 8), and (7, 1). Enemy snake #0 has its head at (5, 4) and body at (4, 4) and (4, 5). My goal is to grow by collecting apples while avoiding collisions with myself, the enemy snake, and the board boundaries.\n\nI'll consider each possible move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n- **UP**: My head would move to (5, 3). Is this cell safe?  \n  - It's not off the board.  \n  - It's not occupied by my body: my body is at (5, 1), so (5, 3) is not in my body.  \n  - It's not occupied by the enemy snake's body: enemy body is at (4, 4) and (4, 5), so (5, 3) is safe.  \n  - However, I need to consider the enemy's potential move. Enemy head is at (5, 4). If the enemy moves DOWN to (5, 3), we could have a head-on collision if I move UP, but I don't know what the enemy will do. Based on the rules, if two heads move into the same cell, both die. But since I don't know the enemy's move, I should avoid moving into a cell that the enemy might move into. The enemy is at (5, 4), so if they move DOWN, they go to (5, 3), which is where I would be. But I can't predict that. However, looking at the enemy's position, they might be going for the apple at (5, 4)? But (5, 4) is where the enemy head is now, and there's no apple at (5, 4) in the list. Apples are at (8,1), (2,9), (1,9), (9,8), (7,1). So (5,4) has no apple. The enemy might be moving towards other apples or just maneuvering.  \n  - Also, after moving UP, I would be at (5, 3), which is between the enemy head at (5,4) and my body at (5,1). If the enemy moves DOWN to (5,3), we collide. But I have to consider all possibilities.  \n  - From a long-term perspective, moving UP takes me towards the apple at (5,4)? But wait, (5,4) doesn't have an apple. The apples are at (8,1), (2,9), (1,9), (9,8), (7,1). So moving UP doesn't directly lead to an apple. The closest apple to me is at (7,1) or (8,1), which are to the right and slightly up.  \n  - Actually, from (5,2), moving UP to (5,3) doesn't get me closer to any apple immediately. The apple at (7,1) is at x=7,y=1, so from (5,2), I need to go right and down. Similarly, (8,1) is right and down.  \n  - But let's list the apples:  \n    - (8,1): x=8,y=1  \n    - (2,9): x=2,y=9  \n    - (1,9): x=1,y=9  \n    - (9,8): x=9,y=8  \n    - (7,1): x=7,y=1  \n  - From my head at (5,2), the closest apples are:  \n    - (7,1): distance |5-7| + |2-1| = 2+1=3  \n    - (8,1): |5-8| + |2-1| = 3+1=4  \n    - (2,9): |5-2| + |2-9| = 3+7=10  \n    - (1,9): |5-1| + |2-9| = 4+7=11  \n    - (9,8): |5-9| + |2-8| = 4+6=10  \n  - So the closest apples are (7,1) and (8,1), both to the right and down.  \n  - Moving UP takes me away from these apples.  \n  - Also, from (5,3), I might be trapped if the enemy moves down or if I move into a dead end.  \n  - So UP might not be the best move.\n\n- **DOWN**: My head would move to (5, 1). But (5,1) is currently occupied by my own body! I cannot move there because it would be hitting myself. From the rules: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" Also, \"moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" Since my body is at (5,1), which is directly below my head at (5,2), moving DOWN is moving backwards into my own body. So this move would kill me. Therefore, DOWN is invalid.\n\n- **LEFT**: My head would move to (4, 2). Is this cell safe?  \n  - Not off the board.  \n  - Check if occupied by my body: my body is at (5,1), so (4,2) is not my body.  \n  - Check if occupied by enemy body: enemy body is at (4,4) and (4,5), so (4,2) is not occupied.  \n  - So it seems safe from immediate collision.  \n  - But I need to consider if the enemy might move into (4,2) or if I might be cornered.  \n  - After moving LEFT, I would be at (4,2). From there, I can move to (3,2), (4,1), (4,3), or (5,2) but (5,2) is where I came from, which is not directly backwards since my body would be at (5,2) only if I don't grow, but since I didn't eat an apple, my tail moves, so (5,2) might be empty after move? No, let's think: when I move, my head moves to new cell, and if I don't eat an apple, my tail is removed, so the body shifts. Currently, my body is [(5,1)], so if I move LEFT to (4,2), my new head is (4,2), and my body becomes [(5,2), (5,1)]? No, let's clarify:  \n  - The snake body is a list of coordinates from head to tail. Currently, head is (5,2), body is [(5,1)], so the full snake is: head (5,2), then body (5,1), which is the tail.  \n  - If I move LEFT to (4,2), and I don't eat an apple, then the new head is (4,2), and the new body is the old head and old body minus the tail? Actually, in Snake, when you move, you add the new head and remove the tail if no apple is eaten. So for a snake with segments [head, body1, body2, ...], after moving, if no apple, new segments are [new_head, old_head, body1, ...] and remove the last segment? But in this case, since I have only one body segment, if I move without eating, the new snake would be: head at new position, body at old head position, and the old tail is removed. So from [ (5,2), (5,1) ] to [ (4,2), (5,2) ]? But that means the body is now (5,2), which was the old head, and the old tail (5,1) is gone. So after move, my body would be at (5,2), which is behind me. So if I move to (4,2), then (5,2) becomes my body, so if I were to move back to (5,2) next turn, that would be into my own body, so it would be suicide. But for this move, moving LEFT to (4,2) is safe because (4,2) is not occupied by any body now.\n\n- **RIGHT**: My head would move to (6, 2). Is this safe?  \n  - Not off the board.  \n  - Not occupied by my body: my body is at (5,1), so (6,2) is safe.  \n  - Not occupied by enemy body: enemy body is at (4,4) and (4,5), so (6,2) is safe.  \n  - After moving RIGHT, my new head is (6,2), and if no apple eaten, my body becomes [ (5,2), (5,1) ]? But wait, if I move to (6,2), and no apple, then the new snake is head (6,2), and body [ (5,2) ], and the tail (5,1) is removed? Actually, with one body segment, after moving, the new body should be the old head, so from current [head (5,2), body (5,1)] to [new head (6,2), body (5,2)]? But the body list was given as [(5,1)] for body, meaning that (5,1) is the only body segment after the head. So when I move, the head moves to new position, and the body shifts: the new body includes the old head and all body segments except the tail? No, in standard Snake, the snake moves by adding a new head and removing the tail. So for a snake of length L, after moving, the new length is L if no apple, or L+1 if apple.  \n  - Here, my snake has head and one body segment, so length 2. After moving, if no apple, length remains 2, so the new snake has head at new position, and body at the old head position. The old tail is removed. So from [ (5,2), (5,1) ] to [ (6,2), (5,2) ]. So yes, after move, my body would be at (5,2).  \n  - So moving RIGHT is safe for this turn.\n\nNow, comparing LEFT and RIGHT:\n\n- Both LEFT and RIGHT are immediately safe.\n\nBut I need to consider long-term strategy and avoiding traps.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake's potential moves. The enemy head is at (5,4), and it has two body segments at (4,4) and (4,5). The enemy might be moving towards apples or avoiding collisions. There are apples at (2,9), (1,9), (9,8), etc., but none very close to the enemy except possibly (5,4) has no apple, so the enemy might be moving to access other apples.\n\nFrom my perspective, I want to go towards apples. The closest apples are (7,1) and (8,1), which are to the right and slightly down. From (5,2), moving RIGHT to (6,2) gets me closer to (7,1) and (8,1). From (6,2), I can then move RIGHT to (7,2) or DOWN to (6,1), etc., to reach (7,1) or (8,1).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,2), I am moving away from those apples. (4,2) is closer to apples like (2,9) or (1,9), but those are far away and might be contested by the enemy or hard to reach.\n\nAlso, from the board, at x=4, y=2, I might be closer to the enemy? The enemy is at (5,4), so if I move to (4,2), I am below and left of the enemy. But if the enemy moves down, it might come towards me, but from (5,4), moving down would be to (5,3), which is away from me.\n\nBut let's think about future moves after LEFT to (4,2):\n\n- From (4,2), I can move to (3,2), (4,1), (4,3), or back to (5,2) but (5,2) would be my body after the move, so I cannot move back immediately.  \n- (4,1): is that safe? From the board, (4,1) is empty? Looking at the board:  \n  Row 1: (0,1) to (9,1): from the board state:  \n  1 . . . . . T . A A .  \n  So at y=1, x=4: (4,1) is '.' which is empty? But wait, the board shows for row 1: from x=0 to 9:  \n  x=0: .  \n  x=1: .  \n  x=2: .  \n  x=3: .  \n  x=4: .  \n  x=5: T (which is my body? But my body is at (5,1), so yes, T represents my body? In the board, it says: \"T\" for my snake? Let's see the key:  \n  In the board state:  \n  \"5 . . . . T . . . . .\" and \"4 . . . . T 0 . . . .\" and \"2 . . . . . 1 . . . .\" and \"1 . . . . . T . A A .\"  \n  So from this, I think:  \n  - \"1\" represents my head? At (5,2) it says \"1\" in row 2? Let's see row 2: \"2 . . . . . 1 . . . .\" so at x=5,y=2, it has \"1\", which is my head.  \n  - \"T\" represents my body? At (5,1) it says \"T\" in row 1? Row 1: \"1 . . . . . T . A A .\" so at x=5,y=1, \"T\" is my body.  \n  - Similarly, for enemy snake: at (5,4) it has \"0\" in row 4: \"4 . . . . T 0 . . . .\" so at x=5,y=4, \"0\" is enemy head, and at (4,4) and (4,5) it has \"T\" for enemy body? But row 4: x=4,y=4 is \"T\", and row 5: x=4,y=5 is \"T\". So \"T\" is used for both my body and enemy body? That might be confusing.  \n  Actually, from the board:  \n  Row 5: \"5 . . . . T . . . . .\" so at (4,5) it has \"T\", which is enemy body since enemy head is at (5,4).  \n  Similarly, row 4: \"4 . . . . T 0 . . . .\" so at (4,4) \"T\" is enemy body, and at (5,4) \"0\" is enemy head.  \n  So for my snake, \"1\" is head, \"T\" is body. For enemy, \"0\" is head, \"T\" is body.  \n  So for cell (4,1): from row 1, it has \".\" so empty.  \n  Similarly, (4,2): from row 2, it has \".\" so empty.  \n  So if I move to (4,2), it is empty.\n\nBut from (4,2), if I move to (4,1), that might be safe, but (4,1) is empty, but is there an apple? No, apples are at (7,1), (8,1), etc., so (4,1) has no apple. Similarly, (3,2) etc. have no apples.\n\nSo moving LEFT to (4,2) doesn't get me closer to any apple; in fact, it moves me away from the closest apples at (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nTherefore, RIGHT to (6,2) seems better because it moves me towards apples.\n\nNow, what about UP? I considered UP to (5,3), but that moves me away from apples, and towards the enemy at (5,4). If the enemy moves DOWN, we collide. Also, after moving to (5,3), my body would be at (5,2), so if I move UP again to (5,4), that might be into the enemy if they are there, or if not, but (5,4) has no apple, so it doesn't gain me anything. And if the enemy moves to (5,3), we collide. So UP is risky because of the enemy proximity.\n\nAlso, in the long term, from (5,3), I might be able to go to (4,3) or (6,3), but again, no apples there. The apples are at (7,1), (8,1), (9,8), etc., so I need to go right and down.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT seems the best move.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are any other considerations.\n\nMy last move was UP, and from the rationale, I was at (5,0) and moved UP to (5,1)? Wait, no, in the last move information, it says \"My head is at (5,0)\" but now it's at (5,2)? That seems inconsistent.\n\nLet's look at the last move information:\n\n\"My head is at (5,0). I cannot move LEFT to (4,0) because it is my body. I cannot move DOWN to (5,-1) because off board. Moving RIGHT to (6,0) is safe but trapped. Moving UP to (5,1) is safe and moves toward apple at (5,4).\"\n\nBut now, after that move, my head is at (5,2)? That doesn't make sense. If I moved UP from (5,0) to (5,1), then my head should be at (5,1), but now it's at (5,2). Perhaps there was a mistake in the board state or I misread.\n\nLet's read carefully:\n\nCurrent state: \"Your snake (ID: 1): - Head: (5, 2) - Body: [(5, 1)]\"\n\nAnd last move: \"Your last move information: ... UP ... My head is at (5,0) ...\"\n\nSo after last move, I moved UP from (5,0) to (5,1)? But now head is at (5,2)? That implies that after moving UP, I must have eaten an apple or something? But I have only 1 apple, and the last move was from (5,0) to (5,1), but (5,1) has an apple? Let's see apples: apples are at (8,1), (2,9), (1,9), (9,8), (7,1). So (5,1) is not an apple. In the board state, at (5,1) it has \"T\" which is my body, so no apple.\n\nSo how did my head move from (5,0) to (5,2)? That would be two moves? But this is turn 7, and last move was turn 6? Perhaps there is a misunderstanding.\n\nLet's see the turn: \"Turn: 7 / 150\" so this is turn 7. Last move was for turn 6? So after turn 6, my head is at (5,2)? That means on turn 6, I moved from some position to (5,2)? But from the last move rationale, it says \"My head is at (5,0)\" which was before the move? And I moved UP to (5,1)? But then after move, head should be at (5,1), but now it's at (5,2). This is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the last move information is from the previous turn, and now we are at turn 7, so after the move on turn 6, the state is updated. But from the last move rationale, I moved UP from (5,0) to (5,1), so on turn 6, I moved to (5,1). Then on turn 7, why is my head at (5,2)? That doesn't add up.\n\nLet's look at the body: currently body is [(5,1)], so if head is at (5,2), that means the body is at (5,1), which is consistent with the snake moving: from head (5,2) and body (5,1), that means the previous head was (5,1) and it moved to (5,2)? But from last move, I moved UP to (5,1), so if I moved to (5,1) on turn 6, then on turn 7, if I didn't move, but I did move, so after moving to (5,1), on the next turn, I would have head at (5,1) and body at where? If I moved to (5,1) and ate no apple, then after move, the body would be the old head, which was (5,0)? But from the last move, before move, head was at (5,0), so after moving to (5,1), new head is (5,1), new body is old head (5,0)? But the current body is [(5,1)], which doesn't match.\n\nI think there might be an error in the description. Let's assume the current state is as given: head at (5,2), body at (5,1). So from this state, I need to make a move for turn 7.\n\nSo for turn 7, head is at (5,2), body at (5,1).\n\nSo for move, I can consider UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nAs above, DOWN is invalid because it would move to (5,1) which is my body.\n\nUP to (5,3): safe from board, but might be risky with enemy at (5,4).\n\nLEFT to (4,2): safe, but moves away from apples.\n\nRIGHT to (6,2): safe, moves towards apples at (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nAlso, from the board, at (6,2), is there any obstacle? The board at row 2: \"2 . . . . . 1 . . . .\" so at x=6,y=2, it's \".\", empty.\n\nSimilarly, at (5,3), from row 3: \"3 . . . . . . . . . .\" so all empty, so (5,3) is empty.\n\nBut for RIGHT, from (5,2) to (6,2), then after move, my body would be at (5,2), which is behind me. So from (6,2), I can move to (7,2), (6,1), (6,3), or (5,2) but (5,2) is my body, so I cannot move back directly. But moving to (5,2) would be left, which is into my own body, so suicide. But that's for next turn, not now.\n\nFor now, RIGHT seems good.\n\nBut let's think about the enemy. Enemy head at (5,4), body at (4,4) and (4,5). If I move RIGHT to (6,2), the enemy might move in various ways. If the enemy moves DOWN to (5,3), then from (6,2) and (5,3), no collision. If enemy moves LEFT to (4,4)? But from (5,4), moving LEFT would be to (4,4), but (4,4) is occupied by its own body? From the board, at (4,4) it has \"T\" which is enemy body, so if enemy moves LEFT to (4,4), it would hit its own body, so that would kill it. Similarly, moving UP to (5,5) might be safe? But (5,5) is empty? From row 5: \"5 . . . . T . . . . .\" so at x=5,y=5, it's empty? Wait, row 5 is y=5? The board rows are from y=9 down to y=0? Let's see the board:\n\nThe board is printed with row 9 at top, row 0 at bottom. So row 9 is y=9, row 8 is y=8, ..., row 0 is y=0.\n\nIn the board, for row 5: \"5 . . . . T . . . . .\" so this is y=5? But in coordinates, y=5 is from top? No, in normal X,Y coordinates, (0,0) bottom left, (9,9) top right, so y increases upwards. So in the board, row 9 is y=9, row 8 is y=8, ..., row 0 is y=0. So row 5 corresponds to y=5.\n\nSimilarly, for enemy head at (5,4), that is x=5,y=4, which is row 4? From board, row 4: \"4 . . . . T 0 . . . .\" so at x=5,y=4, it has \"0\", yes.\n\nNow, if enemy moves UP from (5,4) to (5,5), is that safe? From board, row 5: \"5 . . . . T . . . . .\" so at x=5,y=5, it is \".\" so empty. So it could move UP. But if it moves UP, it goes to (5,5), which is empty. Then no collision with me since I am at (6,2) or wherever.\n\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (5,3), that is empty? From row 3: \"3 . . . . . . . . . .\" so yes, empty. So enemy can move DOWN.\n\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (4,4), but (4,4) is its own body, so it would die if it moves there.\n\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (6,4), which is empty? Row 4: at x=6,y=4, from \"4 . . . . T 0 . . . .\" so after \"0\" it has \".\" so yes, empty.\n\nSo enemy has options.\n\nBut for me, moving RIGHT to (6,2) doesn't immediately conflict with enemy.\n\nNow, another consideration: after moving RIGHT, I might be able to go to (7,1) or (8,1) for apples. For example, from (6,2), I can move DOWN to (6,1) and then RIGHT to (7,1) if apple is there, but (7,1) has an apple, so if I move to (6,1), then to (7,1), I can eat it.\n\nBut from (6,2), moving DOWN to (6,1) might be safe? From board, row 1: \"1 . . . . . T . A A .\" so at x=6,y=1, it is \"T\"? Wait, let's see: row 1 has \" . T . A A .\" so positions: x=5: T (my body), x=6: . ? From the string: \"1 . . . . . T . A A .\" so after five dots, then T, then dot, then A, A, dot. So let's list x from 0 to 9:\n\nFor row 1 (y=1):\nx=0: .\nx=1: .\nx=2: .\nx=3: .\nx=4: .\nx=5: T (my body)\nx=6: . (dot)\nx=7: A\nx=8: A\nx=9: .\n\nSo at (6,1), it is empty (dot). Similarly, (7,1) has apple, (8,1) has apple.\n\nSo from (6,2), moving DOWN to (6,1) is safe, and then from there, moving RIGHT to (7,1) would eat an apple, but that would be on subsequent turns.\n\nBut for now, for turn 7, moving RIGHT to (6,2) is safe and sets me up for that.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,2), I am going away, and it would take longer to reach apples.\n\nTherefore, I think RIGHT is the best move.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any risk from the enemy moving into my path.\n\nSuppose I move RIGHT to (6,2). The enemy might move to (6,4) or something, but that's far away. Or if enemy moves DOWN to (5,3), and I move to (6,2), no issue. If enemy moves DOWN to (5,3), and I move to (5,3)? But I am not moving to (5,3), I am moving to (6,2). So no collision.\n\nThe only risk is if enemy moves to (6,2), but from (5,4), to get to (6,2), it would need to move twice, so not this turn.\n\nSo for this turn, moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nThus, I will choose RIGHT.\n\nBut before finalizing, let's see if UP could be useful for some reason. For example, if I go UP to (5,3), then from there, I could go to (4,3) or (6,3), but again, no apples. And from (5,3), I might be closer to the apple at (9,8) but that's far, and I have to go through the enemy area. Also, from (5,3), if the enemy moves DOWN, we collide. So UP is risky.\n\nLEFT is also safe but less beneficial.\n\nSo I think RIGHT is the best.\n\nTherefore, my move is RIGHT.RIGHT",

There are apples at (7,1) and (8,1) which are very close to my head at (5,2). Moving towards them is the fastest way to score. However, I must be careful not to trap myself or move into danger.\n\nLet's analyze the possible moves:\n- **UP (to 5,3):** This moves me closer to the enemy at (5,4). If the enemy moves DOWN to (5,3), we would collide and die. Since I cannot predict the enemy's move, this is a high-risk move. It also moves me away from the nearest apples at (7,1) and (8,1).\n- **DOWN (to 5,1):** This is my current body segment. Moving here would cause me to collide with myself and die. This is an invalid move.\n- **LEFT (to 4,2):** This is safe from immediate collision. However, it moves me further away from the closest apples. My path would likely be open, but I would have to travel further to reach food, giving the enemy more time to grow.\n- **RIGHT (to 6,2):** This is safe from immediate collision. My body will be at (5,2) after the move, so I cannot immediately reverse direction, but that is fine. This move takes me one step closer to the apples at (7,1) and (8,1). From (6,2), I have multiple future options: I can go DOWN to (6,1) and then RIGHT to (7,1), or go RIGHT to (7,2), etc. This is the most direct route to score points.\n\nStrategy for the next few turns: Move RIGHT now to get to (6,2). On the next turn, I plan to move DOWN to (6,1) to be directly above the apples at (7,1) and (8,1), then move RIGHT to eat one of them. This will increase my score and length, helping me catch up to the enemy.\n\nRIGHT",

This increases my score to 2.\n- Eating an apple grows my snake. My body will become [(6, 1), (6, 2)] (Head at 7,1, Body at 6,1, Tail at 6,2).\n- The Enemy Snake is at (8, 3). It has a tail at (7, 4). It cannot block me. It is likely moving DOWN to (8, 2).\n- There is no immediate threat.\n- Moving RIGHT is the only move that scores points immediately.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving RIGHT is safe, legal, and scores a point. It is the optimal move.\n\nRIGHT",

My body next turn will be [(7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)] if I move.\n\n**2. Board State & Constraints:**\n- **Apples:**\n  - (8, 1) - *Right of my head (7, 1)*\n  - (2, 9), (1, 9) - *Top-left*\n  - (9, 8) - *Top-right*\n  - (9, 4) - *Bottom-right*\n- **Enemy Snake #0:**\n  - Head: (8, 2)\n  - Body: [(8, 3), (7, 3)]\n  - **Analysis:** The enemy just moved from (8, 3) to (8, 2). This is a move DOWN to grab the apple at (8, 1). They are currently at (8, 2). They will likely try to move to (8, 1) next, but they can't because I am at (7, 1) and the wall is to their left. If they move DOWN to (8, 1), they eat the apple and grow. If they move LEFT to (7, 2), they might try to flank me. If they move RIGHT to (9, 2), they go away. If they move UP to (8, 3), they hit their own body.\n\n**3. Move Evaluation:**\n\n*   **HEAD AT (7, 1)**\n    *   **RIGHT to (8, 1):**\n        *   **Analysis:** Contains an **APPLE**.\n        *   **Collision Risk:** Enemy Snake #0 is at (8, 2). To collide head-on, Enemy would have to move to (8, 1) this turn. Since I am moving there, this would be a head-on collision. **Both snakes would die.**\n        *   **Strategic Risk:** Enemy just moved to (8, 2). They are likely aiming for the apple at (8, 1) or trying to position near it. Even if they don't move down immediately, they might move down next turn. This is a high-traffic cell.\n        *   **Result:** **HIGH RISK.** Potential mutual destruction.\n\n    *   **UP to (7, 2):**\n        *   **Analysis:** Valid coordinate.\n        *   **Obstacles:** Empty.\n        *   **Collision Risk:** Enemy Snake #0 is at (8, 2). If Enemy moves LEFT to (7, 2), we collide head-on. This is a distinct possibility as it blocks me and protects the apple.\n        *   **Body Risk:** My body is at (6, 2). If I move UP to (7, 2), I am not moving into the cell behind my head, so it is not immediate suicide. However, the cell (7, 2) is adjacent to my body at (6, 2). Moving into a cell adjacent to my body is safe *as long as it isn't the tail moving into it*. My tail (6, 2) will stay put (because I ate). So moving to (7, 2) puts me right next to my body. This is allowed but tight.\n        *   **Result:** **RISKY.** Possible head-on collision with Enemy moving Left.\n\n    *   **DOWN to (7, 0):**\n        *   **Analysis:** Valid coordinate.\n        *   **Obstacles:** Empty.\n        *   **Collision Risk:** Enemy is at (8, 2). They cannot reach (7, 0) in one move.\n        *   **Strategy:** Moves away from the immediate conflict. Safe.\n        *   **Result:** **SAFE.**\n\n    *   **LEFT to (6, 1):**\n        *   **Analysis:** Valid coordinate.\n        *   **Obstacles:** My body. My body is [(6, 1), (6, 2)].\n        *   **Collision Risk:** Moving into my own body segment at (6, 1).\n        *   **Result:** **DEATH.** (I hit myself).\n\n**4. Strategic Decision:**\nI just ate an apple at (7, 1). The enemy is at (8, 2), presumably having just eaten the apple at (8, 1).\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (8, 1) is extremely dangerous. The enemy is right next to it and we could crash into each other.\n- Moving **UP** is risky because the enemy might move Left to cut me off.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (7, 0) is the only safe move that avoids all conflict. It puts distance between me and the enemy. While it gives up the apple at (8, 1), survival is the priority. The enemy might get the apple, but I stay alive to find others.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI will move **DOWN** to (7, 0) to avoid a potential head-on collision with the enemy snake and to create space.\n\nDOWN",

Board and Enemy Analysis:**\n- **Apples:** Apples at (2, 9), (1, 9), (9, 8), (9, 4), (6, 6). The apple at (8, 1) and the apple at (9, 8) are currently visible.\n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (8, 1), Body at [(8, 2), (8, 3)]. The enemy moved DOWN from (8, 2) to (8, 1). This is confirmed by the board state, which shows '0' at (8, 1) and 'T' at (8, 2).\n    - **Enemy Intent:** The enemy greedily took the apple at (8, 1). This position is precarious for them as they are sandwiched between the right wall and my potential presence.\n    - **Collision Risk:** The enemy is at (8, 1). If I move RIGHT to (8, 0), I am adjacent to them but not colliding. If they move DOWN to (8, 0), we collide (head-on).\n    - **Apple:** There is an apple at (9, 8). The enemy is at (8, 1), far away. I am at (7, 0).\n\n**3. Move Evaluation (from Head at (7, 0)):**\n\n- **LEFT to (6, 0):**\n    - **Obstacle:** My body is at (6, 1). The cell (6, 0) is empty.\n    - **Safety:** This is a valid move. It is not immediately suicidal.\n    - **Future:** Moving left brings me closer to the center/left side where apples (6,6), (2,9), (1,9) are located. It also keeps me away from the enemy at (8, 1).\n\n- **RIGHT to (8, 0):**\n    - **Obstacle:** Empty.\n    - **Collision Risk:** Enemy is at (8, 1). If I move to (8, 0), the enemy is directly above me. If the enemy moves DOWN to (8, 0), we collide and both die. The enemy just moved DOWN, so moving DOWN again would be a valid move for them (unless they were blocked by their own tail, which they aren't). This is a 50/50 gamble on the enemy's move. It is safer to avoid this adjacency.\n    - **Strategy:** Avoid the enemy.\n\n- **DOWN to (7, -1):**\n    - **Obstacle:** Off the board.\n    - **Result:** Death.\n\n- **UP to (7, 1):**\n    - **Obstacle:** My body. The segment (7, 1) is the second segment of my body.\n    - **Result:** Death.\n\n**4. Decision:**\nI must choose between **LEFT** and **RIGHT**.\n- **RIGHT** puts me immediately below the enemy snake. This is dangerous because if the enemy moves DOWN, we both die. The enemy might also move LEFT, which would bring them into (7, 1), which is currently my body. If the enemy moves LEFT into my body, they die, and I survive. However, risking a head-on collision by moving into a cell directly adjacent to the enemy head is generally suboptimal unless forced.\n- **LEFT** moves me away from the enemy. It puts distance between us. It moves me towards the left side of the board where I can access a cluster of apples (specifically (6, 6) seems reachable, and (2, 9) / (1, 9) are also on the left/top). It keeps my right flank open for future movement but avoids the immediate threat of the enemy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **LEFT** is the safer strategic play. It avoids the enemy immediately and positions me to navigate towards the closer apples on the left side of the board. The enemy is currently occupied with the apple they just ate and is pinned against the wall.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Navigate towards the apple at (6, 6). Avoid the enemy at (8, 1).\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

The tail at (6, 1) was the oldest segment and has moved, leaving that cell empty.\n2.  **Enemy Snake #0**: The enemy was at (9, 1). They did not die (board shows no collision). They are currently adjacent to an apple at (9, 8). The distance is 7 units, so they could not have eaten it this turn. They are likely moving towards the apples in the top right.\n3.  **My Goal**: There is an apple at (6, 6). It is 6 units above my current head at (6, 0). This is the closest and most accessible apple.

The coordinates (5, 1) are within the 10x10 board. My body is at (6, 0) and (7, 0); (5, 1) is not in this list. This move is safe.\n*   **DOWN** to (6, 0): The board shows a 'T' (tail) at (6, 0). Since I am snake 1, this is my own tail. My body list is [(6, 0), (7, 0)]. The cell immediately behind my head (current head (6, 1), so down is (6, 0)) is part of my body. Moving into your own body is fatal. **DOWN is UNSAFE.**\n*   **RIGHT** to (7, 1): The board shows 'T' at (7, 1) and (7, 0). My body is [(6, 0), (7, 0)]. (7, 1) is not in my body list, but looking at the board key, 'T' represents the tail of Snake 1. However, my tail is actually at (6, 0), and the segment behind my head is (6, 0). Wait, looking at the board state: \"1 . . . . . . 1 . T T\" at y=1. This shows snake 1 at (6,1) and T at (7,1) and (8,1)? No, the board shows: at y=1: `. . . . . . 1 . T T`. Indices: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. So at y=1, index 6 is '1' (me), index 7 is 'T', index 8 is 'T'. My body is `[(6, 0), (7, 0)]`. So (7, 1) is marked 'T' on the board but is NOT in my current body list. This is likely a visual artifact or the tail segment from *before* I moved last turn. My tail *moved* from (6,1) to (6,0). So (7,1) is NOT my body. Is it safe? Yes.\n*   **UP** to (6, 2): The board shows '.' (empty) at (6, 2). It is within bounds. My body is [(6, 0), (7, 0)]. Safe.\n\n**Analysis of Enemy Snake #0 (Head-on Collision Check):**\n*   Enemy Head at (9, 2). Enemy Body: [(9, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2)].\n*   Enemy potential moves: UP (9,3), DOWN (9,1), LEFT (8,2), RIGHT (10,2 - out of bounds/Death).\n*   I am at (6,1).\n*   If I move **LEFT** to (5,1): Enemy cannot reach (5,1) in one move from (9,2).\n*   If I move **UP** to (6,2): Enemy cannot reach (6,2) in one move from (9,2).\n*   If I move **RIGHT** to (7,1): Enemy cannot reach (7,1) in one move.\n*   Therefore, no immediate head-on collision risk for any safe move.\n\n**Analysis of Apples and Strategy:**\n*   My goal is to survive and eat apples.\n*   Apples available: (2,9), (1,9), (9,8), (9,4), (6,6).\n*   My current head is (6,1).\n*   Apple at (6,6) is a clear vertical shot up the column.\n*   Moving **UP** to (6,2) is the direct step towards (6,6).\n*   Moving **LEFT** to (5,1) deviates from the apple and moves me towards the center/bottom-left, where there are no apples.\n*   Moving **RIGHT** to (7,1) moves me slightly towards (9,4) or (9,8), but it's a longer path and I have to navigate around the enemy (currently at (9,2)).\n*   Moving **UP** is the optimal strategic choice: it secures the path to the apple at (6,6) and keeps me in a column that is currently empty (column 6 has no body segments or enemies listed).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nUP is safe, moves towards the closest apple, and is the best strategic direction.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Strategic Evaluation (Safe Moves Only):**\n*   **LEFT (to 5,2):** Moves away from the vertical apple line at (6,6). The nearest apple at (2,9) requires navigating towards the top-left corner, which is often crowded and restrictive.\n*   **RIGHT (to 7,2):** Moves me closer to Enemy #0 (currently at (9,3)). The column x=7 might be a \"corridor\" between me and the enemy. This increases risk of interception.\n*   **UP (to 6,3):** This is a \"straight line\" towards a guaranteed apple at (6,6). By moving UP, I stay in a relatively empty column (x=6). Most importantly, if I continue moving UP to (6,3), (6,4), etc., I can *see* the entire board state in front of me.\n*   **The Trap:** If I move LEFT or RIGHT, I turn into a row. The row y=2 has my body at (6,1) below and potentially the enemy nearby. Once I enter a row, I might encounter \"walls\" (snakes/borders) and be forced to turn blindly. Staying in the column allows me to scan the vertical axis safely.\n\n**5. Decision:**\nI will move **UP** to claim the apple at (6,6).

Strategic Evaluation:**\n*   **LEFT / RIGHT:** Moving to (5, 4) or (7, 4) moves away from the guaranteed apple at (6, 6). While safe, it wastes a turn where I could be securing points.\n*   **UP:** Target (6, 5).\n    *   This is the optimal move. It brings me one step closer to the apple at (6, 6).\n    *   The path remains clear.\n    *   No immediate threats from the enemy snake.\n\n**5. Decision:**\nI will move **UP** to (6, 5) to continue the efficient path to the apple at (6, 6).\n\n**START PLAN**\nContinue North to (6, 5), then (6, 6) to eat the apple. After eating, assess the board for the next closest food source (likely (9,8) or the cluster at top left).\n**END PLAN**\n\nUP",

Based on the \"snake moved down\" hint (Last Move: DOWN) and the board consistency, the enemy snake (ID 0) is attempting to move UP into (9, 7) this turn. If they succeed, they will occupy (9, 7).\n    *   **Tunnel Trap:** There is an apple at (6, 6). However, the column at x=6 has my body at y=4 and y=3. If I eat the apple at (6, 6), I will grow. The new segment will likely appear at my current tail position (6, 3) or (6, 4), effectively blocking the path back down. Above (6, 6), the row at y=7 is blocked by my body segment at (6, 7). This creates a dead end. Without knowing the positions of *all* enemy body segments (the board only shows heads/tails), moving blindly into this tunnel is risky. If the path is blocked, I will die.\n3.  **Safe Moves:**\n    *   **DOWN (x=6, y=4):** Unsafe. Moves into my own body at (6, 4).\n    *   **UP (x=6, y=6):** Moves to the apple. However, risks the trap described above and potential collision with Snake #0 if they move to (9, 7) and I remain near them.\n    *   **LEFT (x=5, y=5):** This is a safe move. It moves to an empty cell, opens up the left side of the board (row y=5), and keeps my body straight.\n    *   **RIGHT (x=7, y=5):** Also safe, but moves closer to the enemy snake's column.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **LEFT** is the most conservative and safe choice. It avoids the immediate collision with my own body, avoids the potential trap at (6, 6), and avoids moving directly parallel to the enemy snake's likely path.

Valid.\n\n2.  **Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n    *   **Right:** Disqualified.\n    *   **Up:** Leads to (5, 6). While (5, 6) is empty, the target apple at (6, 6) is a \"tunnel trap\" (based on previous reasoning). The space at (5, 7) is currently unknown/empty, but moving up might not offer a safe escape route if Snake #0 (currently at 9,7) decides to move West.\n    *   **Down:** Leads to (5, 4). This opens up the bottom half of the board (y < 4). There are apples at (3, 4) and potentially others in the lower region. This moves me away from the immediate conflict zone near Snake #0 and the \"tunnel\" at x=6.\n    *   **Left:** Leads to (4, 5). This moves me towards the left edge and potentially the bottom half. This is also a safe move.\n\n3.  **Strategy:**\n    The safest strategy is to avoid the dense areas and potential traps. Both **Left** and **Down** are viable. However, **Left** positions the head at (4, 5), leaving the path to (3, 4) open without forcing a turn immediately. If I move Down to (5, 4), I am directly below the target (3, 4), but I am also potentially aligning with the snake #0 column if it moves left (though unlikely to reach me). Moving Left seems to be a good positioning move to open up the left side of the board.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove Left to (4, 5) to distance myself from the collision risk at (6,5) and the trap at (6,6). Assess the board at (4,5) to determine if moving toward the apple at (3,4) is safe or if I should retreat further Left/Down to farm apples in the lower corners.\n\nLEFT",

Evaluate Current Position:**\n- **Head:** (4, 5) (This is the result of my last move, LEFT).\n- **Body:** [(5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4)] (Assuming the tail moved from (6,4) to... wait, the tail from the previous turn was (6,4). After I moved LEFT to (4,5), the body segments shift: Old (4,5) becomes new body, Old (5,5) becomes second body, Old (6,5) becomes third body, and Old (6,4) is the tail. The tail moves to follow the segment at (6,5) or disappears if I ate? I didn't eat, so the tail moves to (6,5) *if* I grew, but I didn't. So the tail simply follows the segment at (6,5). The segment at (6,5) was my previous second body part. It moves to (5,5). So the tail (6,4) moves to (6,5)? No. The body moves. The tail moves to where the second-to-last segment was. The second-to-last segment was (5,5). So the tail moves to (5,5).\nWait, let's trace the snake exactly:\n  - Start of Turn 20: Head (4,5), Body [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4)]? No, Start of Turn 20 was Head (5,5), Body [(6,5), (6,4)].\n  - My move on Turn 20: LEFT -> New Head (4,5).\n  - Body becomes: Old Head (5,5) -> New Body 1. Old Body (6,5) -> New Body 2. Old Body (6,4) -> New Tail.\n  - So, current coordinates are: Head (4,5), Body [(5,5), (6,5)], Tail at (6,4).\n  - Wait, the prompt says: \"Body: [(5, 5), (6, 5)]\". It lists two body segments. This implies the tail is not included in the list, or the list is just the connecting pieces. Usually, the full list includes everything. The prompt says: \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail\". And the board shows `1 T T`. This confirms Head (4,5), Body1 (5,5), Body2 (6,5). The tail (6,4) is not strictly needed for collision check if we assume the list is just what's displayed. However, the tail (6,4) is technically there. Let's verify the previous move. I was at (5,5) with body [(6,5)]. The tail was (6,4). I moved LEFT to (4,5). The new body is (5,5), and the tail moves to (6,5)? No. The tail moves to where the *old* tail segment was *not*? The old segment at (6,5) becomes the new body. The old segment at (6,4) moves to (6,5)? That would be weird.\n      Let's look at the board state from the prompt:\n      `5 . . . . 1 T T . . T`\n      `6 . . . . . . A . . T`\n      `7 . . . . . . . . . T`\n      `8 . . . . . . . . . 0`\n      `9 . A A . . . . . A .`\n      My head is at (4,5) (marked '1').\n      The segment to my right is (5,5) (marked 'T').\n      The segment to the right of that is (6,5) (marked 'T').\n      What about (6,4)? It's marked '.' (Empty). This means the tail has moved or the list provided in the prompt is the full body list?\n      Let's re-read: \"Body: [(5, 5), (6, 5)]\". This is 2 segments. The head is (4,5). So the snake occupies (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). The tail at (6,4) must have moved.\n      Why did (6,4) disappear? Because the snake is length 3 (Head + 2 Body). So the tail (6,4) dropped off.\n      Wait, the previous state had Head (5,5), Body [(6,5)] and presumably the tail was (6,4). But if I moved Left, I did not eat. The tail should move to where the previous body segment (6,5) was?\n      Actually, if the snake is length 3 (Head + 1 Body + 1 Tail), and I have `Body: [(5, 5), (6, 5)]`, that's Head + 2 Body segments. That implies length 4? Or is `Body` just the list of non-head segments?\n      The prompt says: \"Head: (4, 5), Body: [(5, 5), (6, 5)]\". This usually means Head is one, Body is the rest. So the full snake is (4,5) -> (5,5) -> (6,5). The tail is at (6,5)? No, (6,5) is the last element of Body. So the tail is (6,5).\n      But looking at the board `5 . . . . 1 T T . . T`, the 'T' at (6,5) is there. The '.' at (6,4) is empty.\n      So the snake is exactly: Head (4,5), Body (5,5), Tail (6,5).\n      This means the previous snake was length 3? No, the previous snake was Head (5,5), Body [(6,5)], Tail (6,4). That's length 3.\n      When I moved Left to (4,5), I didn't eat. The tail moves to (6,5)? No. The tail moves to where the previous body segment was.\n      Previous: Head (5,5), Body (6,5), Tail (6,4).\n      Move: Head (4,5), Body (5,5), Tail (6,5)? No.\n      The tail (6,4) moves to (6,5) because the segment at (6,5) moved to (5,5)? No. The segment at (6,5) becomes the new body (5,5). The segment at (6,4) (the tail) moves to (6,5)? That would leave a gap.\n      Actually, standard snake logic:\n      1. New head at (4,5).\n      2. Old head (5,5) becomes new body part.\n      3. Old body (6,5) becomes new body part.\n      4. Old tail (6,4) disappears.\n      Wait, if the snake was length 3: Head (5,5), Body (6,5), Tail (6,4). Then after moving Left without eating, the snake becomes:\n      New Head (4,5), New Body (5,5), New Tail (6,5).\n      Yes. So the coordinates are (4,5), (5,5), (6,5).\n      The board shows `1` at (4,5), `T` at (5,5), `T` at (6,5).\n      This matches.\n\n**2. Threat Analysis (Simultaneous Movement):**\n- **My Safe Moves:**\n  - **LEFT (3,5):** Empty. Safe.\n  - **RIGHT (5,5):** Occupied by my body (segment 2). **DEAD**.\n  - **UP (4,6):** Empty. Safe.\n  - **DOWN (4,4):** Empty. Safe.\n\n- **Enemy Snake #0 (ID 0):**\n  - **Head:** (9, 8).\n  - **Body:** [(9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3)].\n  - **Tail:** (9, 3)? No, the list is likely (9,8)->(9,7)->(9,6)->(9,5)->(9,4)->(9,3). Length 6.\n  - **Direction:** Last turn it was at (9,8). The body goes down. It came from (9,7) (Turn 20). On Turn 20, it was at (9,8). On Turn 19, it was at (9,7).\n  - Snake #0 is moving UP (from 7 to 8).\n  - **Possible moves for Snake #0:**\n    - **UP (9,9):** Contains an apple 'A' at (9,9). It will almost certainly eat this apple. If it moves UP, it grows. It has 5 apples, aiming for 6.\n    - **LEFT (8,8):** Empty.\n    - **RIGHT (Off Board):** Dead.\n    - **DOWN (9,7):** Contains its own body (segment at 9,7). Dead.\n\n- **Collision Risk (Turn 21):**\n  - If Snake #0 moves **UP** to (9,9):\n    - It will not collide with me (Distance is huge).\n    - It will not cross my path.\n    - My path is at x=3,4,5. Snake #0 is at x=9.\n  - If Snake #0 moves **LEFT** to (8,8):\n    - It moves closer, but still far away.\n    - Still no collision risk.\n\n**3. Apple Strategy:**\n- **Target Apples:**\n  - (3, 4): Distance is `|4-3| + |5-4| = 2`. Reachable in 2 moves if safe. (e.g., LEFT -> LEFT or LEFT -> DOWN).\n  - (2, 9): Too far.\n  - (1, 9): Too far.\n  - (6, 6): Requires passing through (5,6) -> (6,6). However, (5,6) is adjacent to my body at (5,5) and (6,5). If I go UP to (5,6) and then RIGHT to (6,6), I am entering a tight spot. Also, (5,6) might be dangerous if Snake #0 decides to come West? Unlikely.\n  - (8, 9): Far.\n\n**4. Evaluating Moves:**\n- **LEFT (3,5):**\n  - Approaches apple at (3,4) (1 step away).\n  - Clears the path to the bottom-left corner (0,0-4,4), which has no snakes.\n  - Safe from Snake #0.\n  - Opens up future moves: LEFT, DOWN, UP (Right is blocked by my body at (4,5)? Wait, if I move to (3,5), my old head is (4,5). So Right (4,5) is my body. Blocked.\n  - From (3,5), I can go DOWN to (3,4) (Apple) or LEFT to (2,5). Both are empty.\n\n- **UP (4,6):**\n  - Goes towards (4,9) and the apples (1,9), (2,9). Also towards (6,6).\n  - (4,6) is empty.\n  - (4,7) is empty.\n  - However, (4,6) is adjacent to my body at (4,5).\n  - From (4,6), I can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n  - Going RIGHT towards (6,6) puts me at (5,6), (6,6). (5,6) is safe. (6,6) is the apple. The spot (7,6) is empty. (8,6) is empty.\n  - Is (6,6) a trap? The previous move rationale mentioned a \"tunnel trap\". The tunnel is at x=6. The walls are at x=5 and x=7. Snake #0 is at x=9. It is unlikely to reach x=7 in 2-3 turns to block me.\n  - However, moving UP moves me into the \"middle\" of the board. The bottom left is clear.\n  - If I move UP, I should be careful not to get stuck.\n\n- **DOWN (4,4):**\n  - Moves away from apples.\n  - (4,3) is empty.\n  - This moves me towards the empty bottom-left, but away from the apple at (3,4).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most logical move is **LEFT**.\n- It puts me at (3,5).\n- From (3,5), the apple at (3,4) is directly below (DOWN).\n- If I take the apple at (3,4), I grow.\n- Even if I don't take it immediately, (3,5) is a safe square.\n- It avoids the body at (5,5).\n- It prepares to eat the apple at (3,4).\n\nLet's double check the coordinates.\nHead (4,5).\nLeft -> (3,5).\nIs (3,5) on the board? Yes, x=3, y=5.\nIs it occupied?\nBoard `5 . . . . 1 T T . . T` -> (3,5) is '.'.\nBoard `6 . . . . . . A . . T` -> (3,6) is '.'.\nBoard `4 . . . A . . . . . T` -> (3,4) is 'A' (Apple).\nSo (3,5) is empty.\n(3,4) is an apple.\nIf I go LEFT to (3,5) this turn, next turn I can go DOWN to (3,4) to eat.\nIs it safe to go DOWN to (3,4) next turn?\nIf I am at (3,5) with body [(4,5), (5,5)] (assuming length 3 or 4?).\nIf I am length 3: Head (3,5), Body (4,5), Tail (5,5).\nIf I go DOWN to (3,4) next turn:\nNew Head (3,4) (Apple).\nNew Body (3,5).\nNew Tail (4,5).\nIs (3,4) safe? Yes.\nIs (3,3) safe? Yes.\nSo LEFT is a safe move that leads to an apple.\n\nWhat about UP to (4,6) and going for (6,6)?\n(4,6) -> (5,6) -> (6,6).\n(5,6) is empty.\n(6,6) is Apple.\n(7,6) is empty.\n(6,6) is risky because:\n1. It's surrounded by walls (x=5, x=7). If a snake enters the tunnel, it's hard to get out.\n2. Snake #0 is at (9,8). It is moving North/East/West. It might not enter the tunnel, but it's a confined space.\n3. The apple at (3,4) is in open space.\n\nThe \"open space\" strategy is better.\nApple at (3,4) is in a quadrant with no other snakes (Snake #0 is top right, I am bottom center).\nSnake #0 has 5 apples. I have 2. I need to catch up.\nThe apple at (3,4) is \"free\".\nThe apples at (2,9) and (1,9) require going up into the top-left.\n(6,6) is in the tunnel.\n\nDecision:\nMove LEFT.\n\nLong-term plan:\nMove to (3,5) to position for the apple at (3,4). Eat it next turn. Then navigate towards (2,9) or (1,9) through the left side of the board, avoiding Snake #0.\n\nCheck for head-on collisions:\nSnake #0 moves UP to (9,9) or LEFT to (8,8).\nI move LEFT to (3,5).\nNo overlap.\n\nCheck for indirect collisions (swapping places):\nMe: (4,5) -> (3,5).\nSnake #0: (9,8) -> (9,9) or (8,8).\nNo swap.\n\nCheck if my tail moves into my head's old position or creates a conflict.\nMy body: (4,5), (5,5).\nIf I move Left: New Head (3,5). Old Head (4,5) becomes body. Old Body (5,5) becomes tail.\nMy tail moves to (4,5).\nWait, I am leaving (5,5) empty? No, I am shifting.\nOld snake: (4,5), (5,5), (6,5).\nNew snake: (3,5), (4,5), (5,5).\n(6,5) becomes empty.\nIs (6,5) adjacent to any enemy heads? No.\nIs (5,5) safe? It's my new tail.\nIs (4,5) safe? It's my new body.\nIs (3,5) safe? It's my new head.\n\nWhat if Snake #0 moves into my body?\nSnake #0 is at (9,8). My body is at (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). Impossible.\n\nWhat if I move into Snake #0's body? Impossible.\n\nSo LEFT is safe.\n\nOne minor consideration: Snake #0 might move LEFT to (8,8). It has 5 apples. It might go for (8,9) or (6,6) or (4,9)?\nIt is at (9,8). (8,8) is empty.\nIf it goes LEFT, it is moving away from me.\nIf it goes UP to (9,9), it is moving to an apple.\nMost likely UP or LEFT.\nNeither threatens me.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move.\n\nOne edge case: What if Snake #0 moves DOWN? It can't, it's blocked by its body.\nWhat if it moves RIGHT? Off board.\n\nWhat if Snake #0 is actually moving DOWN the column? No, it's at (9,8) now. The body is (9,7) to (9,3). So it moved UP (increasing Y) from turn 19 to 20.\nSo it is moving UP.\nIt will likely continue UP to (9,9) to eat the apple.\n\nI am at (4,5). I am safe.\n\nI will choose LEFT.\n\nWait, let me re-read the board state carefully.\nApples at: (2, 9), (1, 9), (6, 6), (3, 4), (8, 9).\nMy head (4,5).\nSnake #0 head (9,8).\nMy body: (5,5), (6,5).\nSnake #0 body: (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3).\n\nIf I move LEFT -> (3,5).\nI am getting closer to (3,4).\n(3,4) is an apple.\n(3,4) is safe.\n(3,5) is safe.\n\nWhat if I want to go UP?\n(4,6) is empty.\n(4,6) is safe.\nBut (4,6) is further from the \"easy\" apple at (3,4).\nAlso, (4,6) puts me near the center.\nThe bottom-left (x<4, y<5) is completely empty.\nIt is advantageous to secure the apple in the empty zone before venturing into the middle or top.\n\nSo, LEFT.\n\nFinal check: The move LEFT puts me at (3,5).\nIs there any reason not to go there?\nIf I go LEFT, I cannot go RIGHT next turn (blocked by my body).\nI can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\nDOWN goes to (3,4) (Apple).\nLEFT goes to (2,5).\nUP goes to (3,6).\nAll are empty.\nSo I have options.\nIf I go UP to (4,6), I can go LEFT, UP, RIGHT.\nRIGHT goes to (5,6).\nDOWN goes to (4,5) (Body).\nSo LEFT gives me more options?\nActually, from (3,5) I have 3 options (Left, Up, Down).\nFrom (4,6) I have 3 options (Left, Up, Right).\nBoth are good.\nBut (3,5) is closer to an apple.\n\nI will stick with LEFT.\n\nOne final check on Snake #0.\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (9,9), it eats the apple. It grows.\nIf it moves UP, its tail at (9,3) will move to (9,4)? No.\nSnake #0 is length 6: (9,8) Head, (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3) Tail.\nIf it moves UP to (9,9): New Head (9,9). Old body becomes (9,8), (9,7)... New tail (9,4). (9,3) becomes empty.\nThis doesn't affect me.\n\nMove: LEFT.\n\nThe prompt asks for a \"Short-term plan (next 3 moves)\".\n1. Move LEFT to (3,5).\n2. Move DOWN to (3,4) to eat the apple.\n3. Move LEFT to (2,4) or UP to (3,5) (if length allows) or LEFT to (2,5).\nThis is a solid plan.\n\nThe prompt says: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo I should include the plan in the text, followed by the move.\n\nWait, the prompt says: \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nSo I can write the reasoning and plan, then put \"LEFT\" on the last line.\n\nI am confident in LEFT.\n\nOne potential issue: Snake #0 is at (9,8).\nIt has 5 apples.\nI have 2 apples.\nThe game is Turn 21/150.\nTo win, I need to eat faster.\n(3,4) is the closest apple.\n(6,6) is close but in a tunnel.\n(2,9) and (1,9) are far and near the top.\n(8,9) is near Snake #0.\nSo (3,4) is the best target.\n\nWhat if Snake #0 moves DOWN? It can't.\nWhat if Snake #0 moves LEFT? (8,8).\nWhat if Snake #0 moves UP? (9,9).\nNone of these affect (3,5).\nWhat if Snake #0 moves... wait.\nCould Snake #0 be moving towards the center?\nTo reach me, it needs ~6 moves.\nI will be at (3,5) then (3,4).\nIf I eat at (3,4), I grow.\nThen I can go to (2,4), (1,4) etc.\nOr I can go to (2,9).\nSnake #0 is slow.\nI have plenty of space.\n\nFinal check on \"Moving directly backwards into your own body\".\nIf I move LEFT, my old head is (4,5).\nMy body is (5,5), (6,5).\nSo I am moving from (4,5) to (3,5).\nThe direction is West.\nMy body is to the East (5,5).\nSo I am not moving backwards into my body. Correct.\n\nMove: LEFT.\n\nPlan: Secure the apple at (3,4) by moving left to (3,5) and then down. After eating, navigate to the top-left apples (1,9)/(2,9) through the left side of the board.\n\nOutput:\nLEFT\n\nWait, I should verify the board again.\nRow 5: `. . . . 1 T T . . T`\nIndices 0-9.\nMy head is at x=4, y=5.\nLeft is x=3, y=5. It is a '.'.\nRow 5 index 3 is '.'.\nRow 4 index 3 is 'A' (Apple).\nRow 6 index 3 is '.'.\nSo (3,5) is empty.\nGood.\n\nWhat about the apple at (6,6)?\nRow 6: `. . . . . . A . . T`\nIndex 6 is 'A'.\nLeft of it is index 5 (empty). Right is index 7 (empty).\nIf I go UP to (4,6), then (5,6), then (6,6).\nIs (5,6) safe?\nRow 6 index 5 is '.'.\nYes.\nBut if I go for (6,6), I am in the middle.\nIf I go for (3,4), I am in the bottom left corner.\nThe bottom left corner is safer.\nAlso, (3,4) is an apple.\n(6,6) is an apple.\nDistance to (3,4): 2 steps (Left, Down).\nDistance to (6,6): 3 steps (Up, Right, Right) or (Up, Up, Right, Down...). No, (4,5)->(4,6)->(5,6)->(6,6) is 3 steps.\nSo (3,4) is closer.\nI will eat the closer apple.\n\nFinal decision: LEFT.\n\nLong term plan:\nGo LEFT to (3,5) to prepare for the apple at (3,4). Eat it next turn. Then head towards (2,9) and (1,9) or clear the bottom-left area. Avoid the central tunnel at x=6.\n\nThe move is LEFT.\n\nFinal check on the rules: \"If all snakes die on the same turn... game ends.\"\n\"If any snake reaches 50 apples... game ends.\"\nI am at 2 apples. Snake #0 at 5. Max 150 turns.\nI need to eat.\n(3,4) is the safest bet.\n\nI will output the plan and then the move.\n\nOne detail: The prompt says \"Snake #0 - Head: (9, 8), Body: [(9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3)]\". This implies the body list includes (9,3) as the last segment? Or is it (9,3) the tail?\nIf the list is Head->Tail, then the tail is (9,3).\nSo length is 6.\nIf it moves UP to (9,9), it grows. Tail moves to (9,4).\nIf it moves LEFT to (8,8), it does not grow. Tail moves to (9,4)? No, if it moves Left, the tail moves to (9,4)? Wait, the body follows the head.\nIf Head (9,8) -> (8,8).\nNew Body: (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4).\nOld Tail (9,3) disappears (if length is fixed) or grows (if ate).\nIf it didn't eat, the tail moves to (9,4).\nSo (9,3) becomes empty.\nThis is standard.\nNone of this matters for my move LEFT.\n\nI am ready.\n\nResponse structure:\nRationale/Plan text.\n\"LEFT\"\n\nNote: The prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan... This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo I should write a concise plan.\n\"Move Left to position for the apple at (3,4). Eat it next turn. Then explore the top-left corner.\"\n\nThen the move.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"The final non-empty line... must be exactly one word\".\nSo I will write my reasoning, then a plan, then \"LEFT\".\n\nI will write:\n\"To secure the closest apple at (3,4), I will move Left to (3,5). This avoids the body at (5,5) and positions me to eat on the next turn. From there, I will head towards the top-left apples (1,9) or (2,9).\nLEFT\"\n\nActually, I should be careful about the \"last rationale\" part.\n\"The plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nThis implies I should format the plan clearly.\nMaybe just:\n\"Plan: Move Left to (3,5) to position for the apple at (3,4). Eat it next turn. Navigate to the top-left quadrant (1,9) or (2,9) afterward.\nLEFT\"\n\nOkay.\n\nOne last check. Is (3,5) definitely empty?\nRow 5 of the board: `. . . . 1 T T . . T`\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\n(3,5) is index 3.\nThe character is '.'.\nYes.\nIs (4,5) my head? Yes, index 4 is '1'.\nIs (5,5) my body? Yes, index 5 is 'T'.\nIs (6,5) my body? Yes, index 6 is 'T'.\nSo the board representation matches my understanding.\n\nIs (3,5) adjacent to anything dangerous?\n(2,5): Empty.\n(4,5): My body (old head).\n(3,4): Apple.\n(3,6): Empty.\nSo it's safe.\n\nIs there any risk of Snake #0 moving into (3,5)?\nDistance from (9,8) to (3,5) is 6 x + 3 y = 9 steps. Impossible in 1 turn.\n\nIs there any risk of Snake #0 moving into my tail/path?\nNo.\n\nMove is LEFT.\n\nI will write the responseTo secure the closest apple at (3,4), I will move Left to (3,5). This avoids the body at (5,5) and positions me to eat the apple on the next turn. From there, I will navigate towards the top-left apples (1,9) or (2,9) through the safe left side of the board, avoiding the central tunnel where Snake #0 might interfere.\n\nLEFT",

It also opens up multiple future moves (DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT) while keeping the path toward the remaining apples at (6,6), (3,4) and (3,7) viable. Moving RIGHT would trap us at the edge with very limited escape options, and UP is impossible.\n\nPlan: After moving LEFT we will be at (7,9) with length\u202f7. From there we can consider moving DOWN to approach the lower\u2011row apples or continue LEFT toward the (2,9) and (1,9) apples, always checking that the next move does not run into our own tail or an enemy head. Avoid moving back onto (8,9) immediately to keep flexibility.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "My head is at (2,5). The apple at (3,4) is the closest target (1 move away).\n\nCheck moves:\n- **DOWN to (2,4)**: Safe (empty). 3 turns left of 50. Good path.\n- **LEFT to (1,5)**: Safe (empty). 3 turns left.\n- **UP to (2,6)**: Safe (empty). 4 turns right.\n- **RIGHT to (3,5)**: Occupied by own body. DEAD.\n\nLong-term strategy:\nSurvival is key. The right side of the board is a death trap (Snake #0's tail). The top left has 2 apples but is crowded. The center (3,4) and bottom area (if safe) is the best early game expansion zone. I must avoid Snake #0.\n\nPlan for next turn:\nIf I move **DOWN** to (2,4), I am 1 step closer to the bottom of the board. If the bottom is safe and empty, I can sweep up and then head to the top. **LEFT** to (1,5) keeps me in the center-left but doesn't grab the apple at (3,4). **UP** to (2,6) moves me away from (3,4) but closer to the top apples, though Snake #0 is up there.\n\nLet's evaluate the immediate apple at (3,4). To get it, I need to be at (3,4), (4,4), (2,4), or (3,3) on the next turn. From (2,5), moving DOWN puts me at (2,4), which is adjacent to (3,4). Moving RIGHT is death. Moving UP takes me to (2,6), which is 2 steps away from the apple. Moving LEFT takes me to (1,5), which is also 2 steps away.\n\nI am currently at (2,5).\nOption 1: Move DOWN to (2,4).\nOption 2: Move LEFT to (1,5).\nOption 3: Move UP to (2,6).\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 5: `. . 1 T T . . . . T`\nMy body is at (3,5), (4,5).\nIf I move DOWN to (2,4), I am at `(2,4)`.\nApple at (3,4) is right next to me.\nIf I move LEFT to (1,5), I am at `(1,5)`.\nApple at (3,4) is 2 moves away (via RIGHT, DOWN).\n\nI need to secure points. The apple at (3,4) is free real estate.\nThe board is 10x10.\nBottom left is (0,0).\nCurrent: (2,5).\nIf I move DOWN, I go to (2,4). Safe.\nIf I move LEFT, I go to (1,5). Safe.\nIf I move UP, I go to (2,6). Safe.\n\nSnake #0 is at (8,9). It is moving.\nIts body is along the right edge and top right.\nI am at (2,5).\nDistance to (3,4) is 1.\nIf I go DOWN, I am at (2,4).\nNext turn I can go RIGHT to (3,4) and eat.\nIf I go LEFT, I am at (1,5).\nNext turn I must go RIGHT to (2,5) (my tail will have moved, so (2,5) is empty?) No, (2,5) is my current head. If I move LEFT, my body follows. My tail moves from (4,5) to (3,5). So (2,5) is empty? No, (2,5) is where my head WAS. The cell (2,5) becomes empty when I leave it.\nSo if I move LEFT to (1,5), the board becomes:\nHead: (1,5)\nBody: (2,5), (3,5)\nTail: (4,5) -> (3,5)? No, the body shifts.\nOld: H(2,5), B1(3,5), B2(4,5).\nNew: H(1,5), B1(2,5), B2(3,5).\nSo (4,5) becomes empty.\n(3,4) is empty.\nFrom (1,5) I can go DOWN-LEFT-RIGHT? No.\nFrom (1,5), to get to (3,4), I need to go DOWN to (1,4), then RIGHT twice.\nOr I can go RIGHT to (2,5), then DOWN to (2,4), then RIGHT. This is inefficient.\n\nLet's stick to the plan of getting the apple at (3,4).\nMove DOWN to (2,4).\nThis puts me at (2,4).\nNext turn, I can go RIGHT to (3,4) and eat the apple.\nThe space to the right (3,4) is currently empty.\nThe space to the left (1,4) is empty.\nThe space below (2,3) is empty.\n\nWhy not move LEFT?\nMoving LEFT to (1,5) puts me further from the apple (3,4) unless I want to flank it.\nBut going DOWN moves me closer to the bottom of the board, which is generally safer early on if the bottom row is empty.\nRow 0 is all empty.\nRow 1 is all empty.\nRow 2 is all empty.\nRow 3 is mostly empty.\nRow 4 has an apple at (3,4).\nRow 5 has my body.\nRow 6 has an apple at (6,6).\nRow 7 has an apple at (3,7).\nRow 8 has snake tails.\nRow 9 has apples and snake heads.\n\nIf I go DOWN, I am at (2,4).\nIf I go LEFT, I am at (1,5).\nDistance to (3,4) from (2,4) is 1.\nDistance to (3,4) from (1,5) is 3.\nDistance to (1,9) from (2,4) is (2,4) -> (1,4) -> (1,5) -> (1,6) -> (1,7) -> (1,8) -> (1,9) = 5 moves.\nDistance to (1,9) from (1,5) = 4 moves.\nDistance to (2,9) from (2,4) = 5 moves.\nDistance to (2,9) from (1,5) = (1,5)->(2,5)->(2,6)... = 5 moves.\n\nSo moving LEFT is slightly better for the top apples, but moving DOWN is strictly better for the (3,4) apple.\nSince (3,4) is close, I should take it.\nAlso, moving DOWN opens up the bottom of the board. The board is 10x10. Currently I am at y=5.\nIf I go DOWN, I am at y=4.\nIf I go DOWN again, I am at y=3.\nIf I go DOWN again, I am at y=2.\nIf I go DOWN again, I am at y=1.\nIf I go DOWN again, I am at y=0.\nFrom y=0, I can sweep right.\nSnake #0 is at y=9. It will take many turns for it to reach me if I am at the bottom.\nSo moving DOWN is a good long-term strategy to avoid Snake #0.\n\nWait, Snake #0 is growing. It has 6 apples. It is long.\nIts head is at (8,9).\nIt wants to eat the apples at (1,9) and (2,9).\nIt is trapped on the right side by its own body?\nIts body: [(8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4)]\nHead: (8,9)\nSo to move, it can go UP? (8,10) is off board.\nLEFT? (7,9). Is (7,9) occupied? Board row 9: `. A A . . . . . 0 .`\nWait, the board representation:\n`9 . A A . . . . . 0 .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nApple at (1,9), (2,9).\nSnake #0 head at (8,9).\nSnake #0 body at (8,8) and (9,8)...\nSo (7,9) is empty.\n(8,9) is head.\n(9,9) is board edge? No, indices 0-9. So (9,9) is valid.\nIs (9,9) occupied?\nRow 8: `. . . . . . . . . T T` -> (8,8) is T, (9,8) is T.\nRow 9: `. A A . . . . . 0 .` -> (9,9) is `.`.\nSo (9,9) is empty.\nSnake #0 can move LEFT to (7,9), UP to (8,10) [off], or RIGHT to (9,9).\nIt cannot go DOWN to (8,8) because that is its body.\nSo Snake #0 is somewhat constrained but can move.\nIt is currently at y=9. I am at y=5.\nIf I go DOWN to y=4, I am moving away.\nIf I go UP to y=6, I am moving towards.\n\nThe prompt says \"prefer moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available\".\nIf I move DOWN to (2,4):\nNeighbors: (1,4), (3,4), (2,3), (2,5).\n(3,4) is apple. (2,5) is my body (will be empty next turn).\n(1,4) is empty. (2,3) is empty.\nSo 3 safe neighbors (ignoring the fact that (2,5) will be empty but is currently occupied by my neck).\nActually, next turn my neck is at (2,5). I can't go back there immediately (it's backwards).\nSo from (2,4), I can go LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. UP is backwards (into my body).\nSo 3 options.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,5):\nNeighbors: (0,5), (2,5), (1,4), (1,6).\n(2,5) is my body. (0,5) is empty (left edge).\n(1,4) empty. (1,6) empty.\nSo 3 options.\n\nIf I move UP to (2,6):\nNeighbors: (1,6), (3,6), (2,5), (2,7).\n(2,5) is my body.\n(3,6) is empty (board row 6: `. . . . . . A . . . T` -> (3,6) is `.`).\n(1,6) empty. (2,7) empty.\nSo 3 options.\n\nAll moves offer 3 safe options.\nBut moving DOWN gets me closer to (3,4) and safety.\nAlso, moving DOWN opens up the bottom of the board.\nIf I sweep bottom row, I am safe from Snake #0 (assuming it stays top right).\n\nOne risk: Snake #0 might try to come down the left side?\nIt is at (8,9). Left side is at x=0-2.\nTo get there, it has to traverse the board. It has 6 segments. It can turn.\nBut usually, in these games, the enemy snake stays in its area to get apples.\nThe apples at (1,9) and (2,9) are very close to Snake #0 (it is at (8,9)).\nIt will definitely try to eat those.\nSo it will move LEFT.\nIf it moves LEFT to (7,9), then to (6,9)...\nIt will eat (2,9) eventually.\nIt is growing. It is long.\nIt might block the top area.\nSo I should secure the bottom and middle apples first.\n(3,4) is the closest.\n(6,6) is the next closest.\n(3,7) is higher up.\n(1,9) and (2,9) are high up.\n\nStrategy:\n1. Eat (3,4).\n2. Eat (6,6).\n3. Assess safety of top.\n\nMove DOWN to (2,4).\nNext turn: I am at (2,4). My body is (3,4)? No, my body is (3,5), (4,5).\nWait, if I move DOWN to (2,4), my body becomes [(2,5), (3,5)].\nNext turn I want to go RIGHT to (3,4).\nIs (3,4) occupied by my body? No.\nIs (3,4) occupied by enemy? No.\nSo I can eat (3,4).\n\nWait, check for Snake #0 movement.\nSnake #0 Head: (8,9).\nPossible moves: LEFT (7,9), RIGHT (9,9), UP (off), DOWN (8,8) [blocked by body].\nSo it will likely move LEFT or RIGHT.\nIf it moves LEFT, it moves closer to the center.\nBut it is at y=9.\nI am at y=5.\nIf I go DOWN, I am at y=4.\nDistance increases.\n\nIs there any danger in moving DOWN?\nThe board is clear.\nIs there any apple blocking me? No.\nIs there any snake blocking me? No.\n\nOne small detail: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body\".\nMy current head is (2,5).\nMy body is (3,5), (4,5).\nThe cell directly behind my head is (3,5).\nIf I move DOWN to (2,4), I am not moving backwards.\nIf I move UP to (2,6), I am not moving backwards.\nIf I move LEFT to (1,5), I am not moving backwards.\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,5), I am moving into my body. This is forbidden.\n\nSo I am safe to move DOWN.\n\nLet's double check the coordinates.\nBoard size 10x10. Range 0-9.\nMy head: (2,5).\nTarget apple: (3,4).\nMoving DOWN means (x, y-1) -> (2,4).\n(2,4) is within range.\n(2,4) is empty (checked board state).\nSo DOWN is safe.\n\nWhy not move LEFT to (1,5)?\n(1,5) is empty.\nIt moves me away from (3,4).\nIt moves me towards (1,9).\nBut (1,9) is contested by Snake #0.\nI should probably secure the unguarded apples first.\n(3,4) is unguarded.\n(6,6) is unguarded.\n(3,7) is unguarded.\n\nIs (6,6) safe?\nRow 6: `. . . . . . A . . . T`\n(9,6) is T (Snake #0 body).\n(6,6) is A.\nSo it is on the right side of the board, but not extremely far right.\nSnake #0 is at (8,9) and (8,8)...\nIt might block access to (6,6) if it moves down.\nBut that's 2-3 turns away.\nI can get (3,4) now.\n\nFinal check:\nIf I move DOWN:\nNew head: (2,4).\nNew body: [(2,5), (3,5)].\nNew tail: (4,5) is gone.\nApple at (3,4) is still there.\nSnake #0 moves.\nIf Snake #0 moves LEFT to (7,9), it is safe.\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (9,9), it is safe.\nDoes Snake #0 threaten me? No.\nDo I threaten Snake #0? No.\n\nI am confident in moving DOWN to secure the apple at (3,4) on the following turn, and to open up the bottom of the board for safe sweeping.\n\nWait, I should check if Snake #0 can reach (3,4) before me?\nSnake #0 is at (8,9).\nDistance from (8,9) to (3,4): dx=5, dy=5. Total 10 moves.\nI am at (2,5).\nDistance from (2,5) to (3,4): dx=1, dy=1. Total 2 moves.\nI am much closer.\n\nWhat about the other apples?\n(2,9) is 4 moves away from me.\n(2,9) is 5 moves away from Snake #0 (via (8,9)->(7,9)->...).\nI am closer to (2,9) than Snake #0 is?\nDistance to (2,9) from (2,5) = 4.\nDistance to (2,9) from (8,9) = 6 (if moving LEFT).\nSo I am closer to (2,9) than Snake #0 is!\nWait, Snake #0 is at (8,9). (2,9) is at (2,9).\nSnake #0 can move (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9). That's 6 moves.\nI can move (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). That's 4 moves.\nI am closer to (2,9) than Snake #0 is.\nSo I should consider going for (2,9) or (1,9).\nBut (3,4) is 2 moves away.\n(2,9) is 4 moves away.\nPoints per turn is better for (3,4).\nAlso, going for (2,9) puts me at y=9, which is risky. Snake #0 is there. We might collide.\nIf I go for (3,4), I am at y=4. Safe.\n\nAlso, Snake #0 might block the top if I go for (2,9).\nSnake #0 has 6 segments. It can block the path.\nI should stick to the bottom.\n\nOne more thing:\nIf I move DOWN to (2,4), I am at (2,4).\nNext turn I can go RIGHT to (3,4) and eat.\nThen I am at (3,4).\nNext turn I can go DOWN to (3,3).\nThen I can go LEFT to (2,3) or RIGHT to (4,3)...\nOr I can go towards (6,6).\nFrom (3,4) to (6,6): dx=3, dy=2.\nDistance 5.\nFrom (2,4) to (6,6): dx=4, dy=2. Distance 6.\nSo getting (3,4) is the best start.\n\nLet's verify the board state again visually.\nRow 9: `. A A . . . . . 0 .` -> (0,9) empty, (1,9) Apple, (2,9) Apple, (8,9) Snake #0 head.\nRow 8: `. . . . . . . . T T` -> (8,8) T, (9,8) T.\nRow 7: `. . . A . . . . . T` -> (3,7) Apple, (9,7) T.\nRow 6: `. . . . . . A . . T` -> (6,6) Apple, (9,6) T.\nRow 5: `. . 1 T T . . . . T` -> (2,5) Me, (3,5) T, (4,5) T, (9,5) T.\nRow 4: `. . . A . . . . . T` -> (3,4) Apple, (9,4) T.\nRow 3: `. . . . . . . . . .` -> Empty.\nRow 2: Empty.\nRow 1: Empty.\nRow 0: Empty.\n\nMy current head (2,5). My body (3,5), (4,5).\nIf I move DOWN to (2,4), I am at `(2,4)`.\nThis is safe.\nThe board is open below me.\n\nI will generate the plan for the next turn.\n\"Move DOWN to (2,4) to get closer to the apple at (3,4) and open up the bottom of the board. From (2,4), I can safely sweep the bottom row or pivot to the center apples.\"\nWait, I cannot output future directions. I must just output the current move.\nI can output the rationale. The rationale will be shown to me next turn.\nSo I can write:\n\"To secure the apple at (3,4) and open up the safe bottom area of the board, I am moving DOWN. This avoids the contested top-left apples where Snake #0 is active.\"\nThen output \"DOWN\".\n\nWait, the instruction says \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo I should write the plan in the RATIONALE section.\nThen output the move.\n\nLet's refine the plan.\n\"Move DOWN to (2,4) to position for the (3,4) apple. Plan: Next turn go RIGHT to eat, then sweep bottom left to avoid Snake #0.\"\n\nLet's check if I can survive a collision if I go for (2,9).\nSnake #0 might go LEFT to (7,9).\nIf I go UP to (2,6), (2,7)...\nSnake #0 goes (7,9), (6,9)...\nWe might meet at (2,9) and (2,9) or something.\nIf Snake #0 goes LEFT and I go UP, we might cross paths at some distance.\nBut the prompt says \"avoid likely head-on collisions\".\nGoing for the top apples increases the chance of meeting Snake #0 in the top half.\nGoing for the bottom apples decreases the chance.\n\nSo, DOWN is the correct move.\n\nFinal check on \"moving directly backwards\".\nMy head is at (2,5).\nMy body is at (3,5), (4,5).\nMy tail is at (4,5).\nIf I move DOWN, I am at (2,4).\nThe cell directly behind my head (relative to movement) is (2,6)? No, that's behind relative to the body.\nThe rule is: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head)\".\nThis usually means moving into the cell your head just left? No, that's how normal snake works.\nIn this prompt: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself\".\nUsually, in standard snake, you cannot reverse direction (Head Up -> Move Down).\nHere, my head is at (2,5). My body is at (3,5).\nThe cell \"behind\" my head is the next segment, which is (3,5).\nIf I move RIGHT, I hit (3,5).\nIf I move UP, I hit nothing.\nIf I move DOWN, I hit nothing.\nIf I move LEFT, I hit nothing.\nSo I am safe.\n\nWhat if I was at (2,5) and the body was at (1,5)?\nThen moving LEFT would be backwards.\nHere, body is to the RIGHT.\nSo moving RIGHT is backwards.\nMoving LEFT is forward.\nMoving DOWN is turning 90 degrees.\nAll are valid except RIGHT.\n\nSo I am safe.\n\nI'll output the plan in the rationale and then the move.\nThe plan is just the explanation.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan... This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo I should write it clearly.\n\"Plan: Move down to open up the bottom half of the board and secure the apple at (3,4) safely. Avoid the top right where Snake #0 is active.\"\n\nThen output \"DOWN\".\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nSo I will write:\n\"To secure the closest apple at (3,4) and move towards the safe, open bottom of the board away from Snake #0, I am moving DOWN. This sets up a safe sweep of the bottom row.\"\nDOWN\n\nWait, I need to be careful about the format. It says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\nSo I can write text, then the final line is \"DOWN\".\n\nLet's double check the coordinates one last time.\nHead: (2,5).\nMove DOWN: (2,4).\nIs (2,4) on the board? Yes.\nIs (2,4) occupied? No.\nIs this move backwards? No.\nIs this move into another snake? No.\n\nSeems perfect.\n\nOne thought: Is (3,4) going to be eaten by Snake #0?\nSnake #0 is at (8,9).\nDistance is huge.\nIt can't reach (3,4) before me.\nIt is focused on the top right apples (1,9), (2,9).\n\nWhat about the other apples?\n(3,7) is at y=7.\n(6,6) is at y=6.\nIf I go DOWN to y=4, I am moving away from those too.\nBut I can loop around.\nFrom bottom, I can go Right, then Up.\nOr Left, then Up.\nOr Right, then Up.\n(0,0) to (9,0) to (9,9) is a path.\nI am at (2,5).\nGoing DOWN to (2,4) puts me on the path to (0,0) then sweep.\n\nThere is an apple at (3,4).\nIf I move DOWN to (2,4), I am adjacent.\nNext turn I can eat it.\n\nLet's consider if Snake #0 might move down to the center?\nIt is at y=9.\nTo reach y=4, it takes 5 moves.\nIt has 6 segments.\nIt might get stuck if it goes down.\nIt usually stays near its head to eat apples.\nThe apples at (1,9), (2,9) are very close to it.\nIt will almost certainly go LEFT to eat those.\nSo I am safe moving DOWN.\n\nFinal decision: DOWN.\n\nI will write the rationale as requested.To secure the apple at (3,4) and move towards the safe, open bottom half of the board away from Snake #0's activity in the top right, I am moving DOWN. This allows me to sweep the bottom row and avoid potential congestion in the center and top.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "First, I need to understand the current board state and my position. My snake (ID 1) is at head (2,3), body segments at (2,4) and (2,5), and I've collected 2 apples. The enemy snake #0 is at head (6,9) with a long body. Apples are at (2,9), (1,9), (6,6), (3,4), and (3,7). The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right.\n\nMy last move was DOWN, which I chose to go for the apple at (3,4). Now, I need to decide my next move. I must consider all four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. I should eliminate any moves that would kill me immediately.\n\nLet's visualize my current position: head (2,3), body (2,4), (2,5). So, from (2,3), if I move:\n\n- UP: to (2,4). But (2,4) is my own body segment! That would be hitting myself, so I die. So, UP is not safe.\n\n- DOWN: to (2,2). That seems open, but I need to check if it's on the board. The board goes from y=0 to y=9, so y=2 is fine. Also, check if any other snake is there. From the board state, at y=2, it's all '.' except for x=2, but I'm moving to (2,2), which is '.' in the board representation. So, no immediate danger. But I need to consider if moving down is towards an apple or away. The apples are at (2,9), (1,9), etc., which are up, but I already have an apple at (3,4) which I was going for. Since I moved down last turn, I might be moving away from it? Wait, no: my head was at (2,3) after last move? Let's see my last move was DOWN, so from previous head (2,4)? No, in the description, after last move, my head is at (2,3), and body is (2,4), (2,5). So I moved down from (2,4) to (2,3)? But the body was (2,4) and (2,5), so if I moved down, the head moves to (2,3), and the body follows: the old head becomes first body segment, so old body shifts. So after moving down, head is (2,3), then body was (2,4) and now the second body is (2,5)? But in the list, it's ordered head to tail, so head (2,3), then (2,4), then (2,5). So yes, after moving down, head is at (2,3).\n\nNow, for this turn, if I move down, to (2,2). Is that safe? From board, at y=2, x=2 is '.'. But I need to consider that the enemy snake will move simultaneously. Also, I should check if I'm moving into my own body. My body is at (2,4) and (2,5), so (2,2) is not in my body. So down seems safe.\n\n- LEFT: to (1,3). Check board: at y=3, x=1, from the board state, it's '.' (since at row y=3, it's \". . 1 . . . . . . .\" so x=1 is '.'). Also, no other snakes there? The enemy snake is at top right, so probably safe. But I need to consider if it's into my own body? No, my body is at x=2, y=4 and 5, so (1,3) is fine.\n\n- RIGHT: to (3,3). Board at y=3, x=3, is '.' (since after \"1\" at x=2, it's dots). So also safe.\n\nSo, all directions except UP are immediately safe? UP is unsafe because it goes into my own body. So I can consider DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, among these, I need to favor moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available and move me closer to reachable apples.\n\nFirst, let's list the apples: (2,9), (1,9), (6,6), (3,4), (3,7). I need to see which ones are reachable and safe.\n\nMy current head is at (2,3). The apple at (3,4) is very close: it's at (3,4), which is one step right and one step up. But from (2,3), if I go right to (3,3), then next I can go up to (3,4). But I need to be careful because there might be collisions.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (3,7) is farther away. And apples at (2,9) and (1,9) are up top, near the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at head (6,9), and its body is long: [(7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6)]. So it's in the top right corner. It has 6 apples, so it's growing, but it might be moving towards apples? The apples at (2,9) and (1,9) are on the top row, left side, so away from the enemy. But the enemy might be moving towards those as well? I don't know its movement pattern.\n\nSince snakes move simultaneously, I need to predict where the enemy might go. But I don't have information on what moves the enemy might make. So I should assume that the enemy might move in any direction, but since it's at (6,9), it might move to eat apples or avoid threats.\n\nBut for now, I should focus on my own moves.\n\nI also need to consider that if I move towards an apple, I might grow, and that could affect my body length, but since I'm only 3 segments long, it might not be a big issue yet.\n\nNow, let's think about the board: the bottom part seems open, and I moved down last turn, so I might be exploring the bottom. But there are no apples in the bottom except possibly (3,4) which is at y=4, which is not bottom.\n\ny=4 is in the lower half, but not bottom. The bottom rows are y=0,1,2,3, etc.\n\nFrom my head at (2,3), moving down to (2,2) would take me to y=2, which is farther from apples. The closest apple is (3,4), which requires moving right and up. So moving down might not be optimal for grabbing that apple quickly.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (1,3) might not lead directly to an apple. The apple at (1,9) is far up.\n\nMoving right to (3,3) puts me closer to (3,4).\n\nBut I also need to consider future moves and trapping myself.\n\nLet me sketch a mental map of the board around me.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nRow 9: . A A . . . 0 T T .  -> so at y=9, x=2 and x=3 are apples? Wait, at y=9, it says: . A A . . . 0 T T . so x=0: '.', x=1: 'A', x=2: 'A', x=3: '.', x=4: '.', x=5: '.', x=6: '0' (enemy head), x=7: 'T' (enemy body), x=8: 'T', x=9: '.'? But from the list, enemy body has (7,9), (8,9), so at x=7,y=9 and x=8,y=9, which matches 'T' at x=7 and x=8? But in the string, it's \" . A A . . . 0 T T . \" so for x=0 to x=9: x0='.', x1='A', x2='A', x3='.', x4='.', x5='.', x6='0', x7='T', x8='T', x9='.'? But the enemy body includes (9,8), (9,7), etc., so at y=9, only up to x=8 has 'T', x=9 is '.'? But the list has body at (9,8), (9,7), etc., so at y=9, only x=7 and x=8 have body, x=9 is empty? But in the string, it has T T . so x=7 and x=8 are T, x=9 is '.'? But earlier, the body list has (7,9), (8,9), so yes, at y=9, x=7 and x=8 are body. Then at y=8, it says . . . . . . . . T T so x=8 and x=9 are T? But from body list, at y=8, it has (8,8) and (9,8)? Let's see the body: from head (6,9), then body: (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6). So at y=8: (8,8) and (9,8) are body. So in the board for y=8, it should have T at x=8 and x=9? The string says \" . . . . . . . . T T \" which likely means x=0 to x=7 are '.', x=8 and x=9 are 'T'. Similarly for y=7: \" . . . A . . . . . T \" so x=3 is 'A'? But apple at (3,7)? Apples are listed as (3,7), so yes. And at y=7, x=9 is 'T' which is body from (9,7)? Yes. Similarly y=6: \" . . . . . . A . . T \" so x=6 is 'A' (apple at (6,6)), and x=9 is 'T' (body from (9,6)?). y=5: \" . . T . . . . . . . \" so at x=2, there is 'T'? But from where? The body of snake #0? No, snake #0 body is all at high y, so at y=5, x=2, it might be from my snake? My snake body is at (2,4), (2,5), so at y=4 and y=5, x=2 are 'T' for my body? In the board, at y=4: \" . . T A . . . . . . \" so at x=2, 'T' which is my body? But my head is at (2,3), so at y=3, it's '1' for my head, and at y=4, 'T' for first body segment, and at y=5, 'T' for second body segment. Yes, so in the board, '1' is my head, 'T' is my body or enemy body? In the board representation, it seems '1' is my head, 'T' is my body, and '0' is enemy head, 'T' for enemy body? But in the board, at y=9, x=6 is '0' for enemy head, and x=7,8 are 'T' for enemy body. Similarly, at y=8, x=8,9 are 'T' for enemy body. But at y=5, x=2 is 'T', which must be my body, since my body is there. Similarly at y=4, x=2 is 'T' for my body. So in the board, 'T' represents both my body and enemy body? That might be confusing, but from context, we know that my body is at (2,4) and (2,5), so 'T' at those points are my body.\n\nSimilarly, for enemy, 'T' at their positions.\n\nNow, back to my moves.\n\nI need to consider where the enemy might move. The enemy snake #0 is at head (6,9). It has apples at (2,9), (1,9) which are on the top left, and (6,6) which is below, and (3,7) which is left-down. So the enemy might move towards those apples. But since it has many apples, it might be growing long, so it could be cautious.\n\nBut I don't know its strategy, so I should assume it might move in any direction, but I need to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nIf I move right to (3,3), and the enemy moves left or down, it might not collide immediately, but since the enemy is at (6,9), far away, collision is unlikely for now.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (2,2), I might be moving away from apples, but it might be safer if I want to explore the bottom.\n\nBut I have an apple at (3,4) which is close, so I should try to eat that soon.\n\nNow, let's list the safe moves and their consequences:\n\n- DOWN to (2,2): This is safe. From there, I can move to (2,1), (2,0), (1,2), (3,2), etc. But no apples immediately nearby. The closest apple is (3,4), which is two steps away? From (2,2) to (3,4) requires right and up twice? Actually, from (2,2) to (3,4): if I move right to (3,2), then up to (3,3), then up to (3,4)? But that's three moves, and I might need to grow, but since I'm not eating apples, I might not grow, so my body length remains, so I might be able to go there without issue. But moving down might take me away from the apple, so if I go down, I might lose the opportunity to get (3,4) quickly if someone else takes it? But apples don't move until eaten, so it should be there for a while. But I should prioritize apples that are safe to get.\n\n- LEFT to (1,3): From (1,3), I can move to (1,2), (1,4), (0,3), (2,3) but (2,3) would be backwards into my own body? After moving left, my head would be at (1,3), and body would be at (2,3) and (2,4)? Let's think: if I move left from (2,3) to (1,3), then the new body would be: new head (1,3), then old head (2,3) becomes first body, then old body (2,4) becomes second body, and the tail (2,5) moves? But since I'm moving, the tail moves forward, so after move, my body would be: head (1,3), then (2,3), then (2,4), and the tail at (2,5) would be gone? No, when the snake moves, the head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, and the tail disappears if no apple is eaten, or if apple is eaten, the tail doesn't move, so body grows.\n\nIn this case, if I move and don't eat an apple, the tail moves forward, so the body length remains the same? Actually, in snake game, when you move without eating, the tail moves, so the body length stays the same? Let's see: initially, head at (2,3), body at (2,4), (2,5). So body length is 2, so total segments including head: 3. After moving without eating, head moves to new cell, then the body shifts: the first body segment moves to where the head was, and the second body segment moves to where the first body was, and the tail is removed? So the body segments remain two? But in the list, after moving, the head is new, then the old head becomes first body, and the old first body becomes second body, but if there were only two body segments, after moving, there should be two body segments: one from old head, one from old first body? But the old second body? Let's think carefully.\n\nIn snake games, the snake has a list of segments. When it moves without eating, the head moves to a new cell, and then each segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So the tail segment is removed. So the number of segments remains the same? No: initially, if the snake has length L, it has L segments, including head? Typically, in snake representation, the list has head first, then body segments, so the list length is the length of the snake. For example, if head and two body segments, list length is 3, meaning snake length is 3. When it moves without eating, the head moves to new cell, then the new list is: new head, then old head, then old first body? But what about the old second body? If the snake has length L, after moving without eating, the new list should have length L, with the new head, and then the first L-1 segments from the old list? But the old list has L segments: head, body1, body2, ..., body_{L-1}. After moving, the new list should be: new head, then old head, then old body1, ..., old body_{L-2}? So the last old body segment is removed? That means the tail moves, and the snake length remains the same? But in terms of segments, if you have three segments, after moving without eating, you still have three segments: the new head, the old head, and the old first body? But what about the old second body? In my case, initial list: head (2,3), body1 (2,4), body2 (2,5). So after moving without eating, the new head moves to, say, (2,2). Then the new list should be: new head (2,2), then old head (2,3), then old body1 (2,4). So the old body2 (2,5) is removed? So the snake length decreases? But in standard snake game, when you move without eating, the snake does not grow, so the tail moves forward, meaning the length remains the same? Actually, no: in standard snake game, the snake has a fixed length until it eats an apple, then it grows by one segment. But when it moves without eating, the tail moves, so the length remains the same? But in terms of segments, if the snake has n segments, after moving without eating, it still has n segments? Let's think: if the snake is length n, it has n cells occupied. When it moves, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail cell is vacated, so the number of occupied cells remains n. So the number of segments remains n. So in the list, after moving without eating, the new list has n elements: new head, and then the first n-1 elements from the old list? But that would be new head, old head, old body1, ..., old body_{n-2}. So the old body_{n-1} is not included? But that means the last body segment is removed? But if n=3, old list: head, body1, body2. New list: new head, old head, old body1. So body2 is gone, so length is still 3? But body2 was the tail, so after moving, the tail is old body1, so yes, the snake moves forward, so the tail moves from body2 to body1, so the segment that was body2 is no longer part of the snake. So the list should have the new head, then the old head, then the old body1, and the old body2 is discarded. So the snake length remains the same, but the tail shifts.\n\nIn this game, from the description, when you move without eating, the body follows, so the number of segments remains the same? But when you eat an apple, you grow by one segment, so the list length increases by one.\n\nIn the initial state, my snake has head and two body segments, so length 3, and I have collected 2 apples. Since each apple adds one segment, if I started with length 1 (just head), after two apples, I should have length 3, which matches: head and two body segments. So yes.\n\nSo when I move without eating, the length remains 3, so after move, I still have three segments: new head, then old head, then old first body? But in the list, it should be: new head, then old head, then old body1? But what about old body2? From the move, the tail moves, so old body2 is no longer part of the snake. So in the new list, the segments are: new head, old head, old body1. But old body1 was at (2,4), so after move, it becomes the tail? But in the list, the last segment is the tail, so yes, old body1 becomes the tail.\n\nIn this case, if I move from (2,3) to (1,3), without eating, then new head at (1,3), new body: old head at (2,3), and old body1 at (2,4)? But then the tail would be at (2,4)? But previously, I had body1 at (2,4) and body2 at (2,5), so after move, body1 moves to (2,3)? No, let's clarify.\n\nWhen the snake moves, each body segment moves to the position of the segment in front. So the head moves to new position, then the first body segment moves to the old head position, the second body segment moves to the old first body position, and so on. The last body segment moves to the position of the second last body segment? But since the head moved, the tail might not move if no eating, but actually, the tail always moves because the snake is moving forward.\n\nIn terms of the list: let L be the list of segments from head to tail.\n\nAfter a move without eating:\n- The new head is at new position.\n- The new list[1] (first body) is the old head.\n- The new list[2] is the old list[1] (first body).\n- ...\n- The new list[i] is the old list[i-1] for i from 1 to len-1.\n- The old list[len-1] is removed? No, the list length remains the same, so we need to keep all segments? But if the list length remains the same, then after move, the new list should have the same number of segments, so we add a new head, and keep the old segments, but then the tail would be duplicated? I think I have a confusion.\n\nStandard snake algorithm:\n- Initialize snake with segments: [head, body1, body2, ..., body_k] where k is body length, so total segments L = k+1.\n- When moving in a direction:\n  - New head = current head moved in direction.\n  - Insert new head at the front of the list.\n  - If no apple eaten, remove the last element from the list (the tail).\n  - If apple eaten, do not remove the tail, so the list length increases by 1.\n\nSo, in this case, my snake has list: [ (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) ] so L=3.\nIf I move without eating, I add new head at new position, and remove the tail, so new list: [ new_head, (2,3), (2,4) ]? But then the old tail (2,5) is removed, so the snake now has segments at new_head, (2,3), (2,4). So the body is now from (2,3) to (2,4), and tail at (2,4)? But previously, body was from (2,4) to (2,5), so after move, the body shifts, and the tail moves from (2,5) to (2,4)? So yes, the snake moves forward, so the tail advances.\n\nSo in practice, after moving without eating, the snake length remains the same, but the segments are shifted: the new head is added, and the tail is removed.\n\nSo for safety, when considering moves, I need to ensure that the new head position is not in the current body segments? But after move, the body segments change, so I need to consider that after I move, my body will be at new positions, but for the immediate move, I need to check if the new head position is currently occupied by my body or another snake's body? But since moves are simultaneous, I need to check if the new head position is currently occupied by any snake body (including my own) before the move? But after the move, the bodies move, so it might be that my new head position was previously empty, but during the move, if I move into a cell that was previously occupied by my own body, but that body segment moves away, so it might be safe? But the rules say: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So it means during the move, if the cell you are moving into is currently occupied by any snake body (at the beginning of the turn), then you die. So I need to check the board state before any moves, i.e., the current board state, to see if the new head position is occupied by any body segment (either mine or enemy's).\n\nSimilarly, if two heads move into the same cell, both die.\n\nSo for decision, I need to look at the current board state and see where the bodies are, and avoid moving into those cells.\n\nAlso, for my own body, I need to avoid moving into my own current body segments, even if they will move away, because at the moment of move, the cell is occupied, so I die.\n\nSimilarly, for enemy body, if I move into it, I die.\n\nBut if an enemy head moves into my body, that enemy dies, but I survive? The rules say: \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\" So if I move into another snake's body, I die, but if another snake moves into my body, they die, and I continue.\n\nSo for my move, I need to avoid moving into any current body segment (mine or enemy's).\n\nNow, let's list the current body segments from the board.\n\nFrom my snake: head at (2,3), body at (2,4), (2,5). So my body segments: (2,3) is head, but since I'm moving from there, I don't care about the head? When I move, the new head will be at new position, so I need to check if new position is in current body segments of any snake? But my current head will be part of my body after move? No, after move, my current head becomes the first body segment, so when I move, the cell I'm moving from will be occupied by my body after move? But during the move, when I choose to move, the board state is before any moves, so the current head is still at (2,3), and it is occupied, so if I move to a cell that is currently occupied by my own body, I die. But if I move to a cell that is currently empty, but after move, it might be occupied, but since moves are simultaneous, we only care about the state before moves for collision.\n\nSo, for my move decision, I need to check for each direction: will the new head cell be occupied by any snake body (including my own) in the current board state?\n\nAlso, for out of bounds.\n\nAnd for moving backwards into my own body: that is, if I move in the direction opposite to the direction from my head to my first body segment? But since I have a list, I can compute the current direction of the snake. From head (2,3) to first body (2,4), so the body is below the head? Since y increases upwards, from head (2,3) to body (2,4), so the body is above the head? Let's see coordinates: y=3 is below y=4, so from head (2,3) to body (2,4), it means the body is above the head? But in terms of movement, if I move down, to (2,2), that is away from the body, so it should be safe. If I move up, to (2,4), that is directly into the first body segment, which is moving away? But according to rules, moving directly backwards into your own body means moving into the cell directly behind your head, which is the cell where your first body segment is? So if I move up to (2,4), which is currently occupied by my first body segment, so I die. So yes, UP is dead.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left or right, it might not be directly backwards, so it might be safe as long as that cell is not occupied by any body.\n\nNow, let's check each direction for current board state.\n\nCurrent board state from the given representation:\n\nI need to extract the occupied cells from the board.\n\nFrom the board:\n\nRow 9: . A A . . . 0 T T .  -> so occupied cells: apples at (1,9), (2,9)? But apples are given separately, so for body, at y=9, x=6 is '0' (enemy head), x=7 and x=8 are 'T' (enemy body). Also, apples are at (2,9) and (1,9), but those are apples, not body. So for body, we have enemy head at (6,9), enemy body at (7,9), (8,9).\n\nBut from the enemy snake list, head (6,9), body: (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6). So all these are occupied by snake body.\n\nSimilarly, my body: from my snake, head (2,3), body (2,4), (2,5). So occupied cells: (2,3) is head, but since I'm moving, I consider it as occupied? Yes, because if I move into it, but I'm moving from it, so for new head position, I need to avoid cells that are currently occupied by any snake body, including my own current head? But my current head will be vacated after I move? But since moves are simultaneous, the occupancy is based on before move, so yes, my current head cell is occupied, so if I move into a cell that is currently occupied by my own head, but that doesn't make sense because I'm moving from it. So when checking new head position, I should not consider the current head cell as occupied for myself? Let's think carefully.\n\nThe rules say: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So \"any snake's body\" includes the current position of the body segments. But when you move, your head leaves its current cell, and moves to a new cell. So if the new cell is currently occupied by any body segment (from any snake, including your own), then you die. So for your own snake, the current body segments include all segments except that the head might be moving, but the other segments are still there. And importantly, the current head cell is not considered a body segment? In the list, the head is the first element, but when we say \"body\", it might include the head or not? In the rule, it says \"any snake's body\", but in snake games, the entire snake is often considered the body, including the head? But typically, the head is separate, but when we say \"body\", it might mean the segments behind the head. But in the rule, it says \"your head moves into any snake's body\", so \"body\" probably means the entire snake except the head? Or including the head? Let's read the rule: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" This implies that if your head moves into the position of any snake's body segment, you die. But your own body includes your own head? If your head moves into your own head position? That doesn't make sense because your head is moving from its current position. So typically, \"body\" means the segments behind the head. But to be precise, let's see the example: \"moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" So the cell directly behind your head is where your first body segment is. So when we say \"body\", it includes the segments from the first body segment onwards, not including the head? But in the list, the head is included in the list, but when considering movement, the head is moving, so for collision, if your head moves into a cell that is currently occupied by any of your own body segments (i.e., the segments from index 1 onwards), then you die. Similarly for enemy snakes, if you move into any segment of their snake (including their head? But their head is also moving, so if you move into their current head position, but since both heads are moving, it might be a head-on collision? Let's see the rules: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\" So if you move into a cell where an enemy head is currently, but since both are moving, you might not collide if they move away? No, the collision is determined based on the new positions after move. But for body collisions, it's based on current body positions before move.\n\nThe rules state: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So it means after you choose your move, your head will be at a new cell, and if that new cell is currently occupied by any snake's body (including your own) before the move, then you die. But what about the head? Is the head considered part of the body? In common sense, the head is not part of the body, but the rule says \"any snake's body\", which might include the entire snake, but since the head is moving, it might be excluded. To avoid confusion, let's assume that \"body\" means the segments behind the head, so the head itself is not considered \"body\" for collision purposes. But then, if your head moves into the current position of an enemy head, that would be a head-on collision only if both move into the same cell? But if you move into the current position of an enemy head, and the enemy head moves away, then after move, your head is at that cell, and the enemy head is elsewhere, so no collision? But the rule says \"if two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn\", which implies that we consider the new positions after move. So for body collision, it's based on the current positions before move, for head collision, it's based on new positions after move.\n\nSo for your move safety, you need to ensure that your new head position is not currently occupied by any snake's body segment (i.e., any segment except the heads? But heads are also segments, but since they are moving, it might be that heads are not considered \"body\" for this purpose? Let's read the rule carefully: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" The term \"body\" here likely means the segments of the snake excluding the head, because if it included the head, then moving into another snake's head would kill you, but that might not be true because if you move into another snake's head position, but that snake head moves away, then after move, you are in that cell, and the snake head is elsewhere, so no collision. But the rule for head-on collision is separate: if two heads move into the same cell, both die. So if you move into a cell where an enemy head is currently, but the enemy head moves away, then after move, you are in that cell, and the enemy head is in another cell, so no head-on collision. But is there a body collision? The enemy head is not part of the body, so if you move into the current position of an enemy head, since it's not body, you don't die from body collision. So only body segments (non-head) cause body collision.\n\nSimilarly, for your own snake, if you move into your own body segment, you die, but if you move into your own head? But your head is moving, so you never move into your own head because your head is leaving that cell.\n\nSo, in summary, for body collision, you need to avoid moving into any cell that is currently occupied by a body segment of any snake (including your own), where body segment means any segment except the head. But in the list, the head is the first element, and the body segments are the subsequent elements. So when checking, for my own snake, I should avoid moving into cells that are in my body list (from index 1 onwards). For enemy snakes, I should avoid moving into cells that are in their body list (from index 1 onwards, or including head? According to the above reasoning, only non-head segments are \"body\" for collision purposes.\n\nLet's confirm with the rules: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" and \"moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" The cell directly behind your head is where your first body segment is, so that is considered part of your body.\n\nAlso, from the enemy snake example, if you move into their body, you die.\n\nBut for the head, it is not considered body, so moving into an enemy head position does not cause body collision. However, if both heads move into the same cell, it causes head-on collision and both die.\n\nSo for safety check, when choosing a move, for each direction, compute new head position.\n\nThen, check if new head position is outside the board? If yes, die.\n\nCheck if new head position is currently occupied by any body segment of any snake (including your own). What about your own head? Your own head is at current position, but new head position is different, so no issue. So for your own snake, check if new head position is in your body segments (i.e., the list without the head). For other snakes, check if new head position is in their body segments (without head).\n\nBut also, for head-on collision, we need to consider where other snakes will move, but since we don't know their moves, we can only consider possible collisions if multiple snakes might move into the same cell. But since we don't know enemy moves, we might assume that if a cell is currently empty, but after move, multiple heads might move into it, we die? But we don't know, so we might need to consider risk.\n\nBut for now, for immediate death, we only care about body collisions and out-of-bounds.\n\nSo let's apply this to my moves.\n\nMy current head: (2,3)\n\nMy body segments: from list, after head, we have (2,4) and (2,5), so these are body segments. So cells (2,4) and (2,5) are occupied by my body.\n\nEnemy snake #0: head at (6,9), body segments: (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6). So these cells are occupied by enemy body.\n\nNow, check moves:\n\n- UP: new head (2,4). But (2,4) is my body segment? Yes, from my body segments, (2,4) is occupied. So I would move into my own body, so I die. So UP is not safe.\n\n- DOWN: new head (2,2). Is (2,2) occupied by any body? From my body: (2,4), (2,5) - not (2,2). From enemy body: all enemy body are at y=6 or higher, so no. Also, from board, at y=2, x=2 is '.'. So no body there. So DOWN is safe from body collision. Also, within bounds. So DOWN is safe.\n\n- LEFT: new head (1,3). Is (1,3) occupied by any body? My body: only (2,4) and (2,5), so no. Enemy body: all at y=6 or higher, so no. Board at y=3, x=1 is '.'? From board row y=3: \" . . 1 . . . . . . .\" so x=0: '.', x=1: '.', x=2: '1' (head), so x=1 is '.', so empty. So LEFT is safe.\n\n- RIGHT: new head (3,3). Is (3,3) occupied? My body: no. Enemy body: no. Board at y=3, x=3 is '.'? From the string, after \"1\" at x=2, so x=3 is '.'. So RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo all except UP are safe immediately.\n\nNow, among DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, I need to choose one that increases chance to eat apples and keeps options open.\n\nNow, let's see the apples: (2,9), (1,9), (6,6), (3,4), (3,7).\n\nFrom my head at (2,3), the closest apple is (3,4), which is at distance: |3-2| + |4-3| = 1+1=2 moves away? But since I can only move one step at a time, it's two moves away if I go directly: e.g., right then up, or up then right but up is not safe, so only right then up? But after moving right to (3,3), then next I can move up to (3,4), which is an apple. But I need to ensure that after moving right, I can still move up safely.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (3,7) is farther, and (2,9) and (1,9) are up top, near enemy snake.\n\nSo, moving right towards (3,4) seems good.\n\nBut let's consider the enemy snake. Enemy snake #0 is at (6,9) with long body. It might move towards the apples at (2,9) or (1,9) or (6,6) or (3,7). Since it has many apples, it might be growing, but it might also be cautious. The board has apples at (2,9) and (1,9), which are on the top row, left side, away from enemy's current position? Enemy is at (6,9), so (2,9) is left, so it might move left to eat those apples. But its body is in the way? It has body at (7,9), (8,9), so if it moves left, it might hit its own body? But since it has head at (6,9), moving left to (5,9) would be towards the apples, but is (5,9) safe? From board, at y=9, x=5 is '.'? From string: \". A A . . . 0 T T .\" so x=5 is '.'? Let's see: x=0:'.', x=1:'A', x=2:'A', x=3:'.', x=4:'.', x=5:'.', x=6:'0', x=7:'T', x=8:'T', x=9:'.' so yes, x=5 is empty. So it could move left to (5,9). But its body might be in the way? After moving, its body would shift, but since it's moving left, it might be safe. But I don't know its strategy.\n\nSimilarly, it might move down to (6,8), but that might not have apples immediately. Or towards (6,6) which has an apple.\n\nBut for now, since it's far away, I might not need to worry about immediate collision.\n\nNow, back to my moves.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,3), then next turn, I can move UP to (3,4) to eat the apple. But I need to ensure that (3,4) is safe after move. Currently, (3,4) has an apple, and it's not occupied by any snake body? From board, at y=4, x=3 is 'A'? From board row y=4: \" . . T A . . . . . . \" so at x=3, it's 'A' for apple, and at x=2, it's 'T' for my body? So yes, (3,4) is apple, and no body there currently. So after I move right to (3,3), on the next turn, if I move up to (3,4), I would eat the apple and grow. But I need to consider if any other snake might move into (3,4) on the same turn? But since I don't know, I might assume it's safe for now.\n\nSimilarly, if I move LEFT to (1,3), I might be moving towards the apple at (1,9), but that is far, and I might encounter enemy or get trapped.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2,2), I might be moving away from apples, but exploring the bottom, which might have no apples, so it might be wasting time.\n\nSo, moving RIGHT seems better because it goes towards the closest apple.\n\nBut I also need to consider that after moving right, my body will shift: new head at (3,3), new body: old head (2,3), and old body1 (2,4)? So body segments at (2,3) and (2,4). Then from there, I can move up to (3,4) for apple.\n\nBut is there any risk? If I move right to (3,3), and then up to (3,4), I might be moving into a path that could be blocked later, but for now, it seems open.\n\nNow, what about moving LEFT? If I move left to (1,3), then I can move up to (1,4), but no apple there, or right back to (2,3) but that might be into my own body? After moving left, my body would be at (2,3) and (2,4)? So if I then move right, I would go to (2,3), which is now occupied by my body? After moving left, new head at (1,3), body at (2,3) and (2,4)? So if I move right, new head would be at (2,3), but (2,3) is currently occupied by my first body segment? So that would be moving into my own body, so I die. So from (1,3), moving right is not safe because it would be into my body. Similarly, moving up to (1,4) might be safe, but no apple there. Moving down to (1,2) might be safe. So from (1,3), I have options, but no immediate apple.\n\nWhereas from (3,3), I have an immediate apple at (3,4) by moving up.\n\nSo RIGHT seems better.\n\nBut I need to consider if moving right might put me in a position where I might have head-on collision with enemy? The enemy is far away, so unlikely.\n\nAlso, I should consider the board size and my future movements. If I move right to (3,3), then after eating apple at (3,4), I might grow, and then I can go to other apples.\n\nBut let's see if there are any constraints.\n\nAnother thing: the enemy snake might be moving towards the apples at (3,7) or (6,6), but since I'm at (3,3), I might be able to reach (3,4) first.\n\nAlso, there is an apple at (6,6), but it's far, and enemy might go for it.\n\nBut for now, I think moving RIGHT is a good choice.\n\nBut let's also consider moving DOWN: if I move down to (2,2), then I might be able to move to (2,1), (1,2), etc., but no apples nearby, so it might be less productive.\n\nSimilarly, LEFT to (1,3) doesn't lead to immediate apple.\n\nSo, between DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, RIGHT seems most promising.\n\nBut I need to ensure that after moving right, I can safely move up to eat the apple.\n\nSo, for this turn, I choose RIGHT.\n\nBut before finalizing, let's think about long-term plan.\n\nMy long-term plan: I have only 2 apples, enemy has 6, so I need to catch up. There are apples available, so I should focus on eating apples quickly and safely. I should avoid the enemy's area and stay in the left part of the board where apples are. After eating (3,4), I can go for (3,7) or (2,9) or (1,9), but (2,9) and (1,9) are near enemy, so might be risky. Perhaps I should go for (3,7) after (3,4), since it's in the same column.\n\nBut let's see the path: after eating at (3,4), I would be at head (3,4), body at (3,3) and (2,3)? After eating, I grow, so new segments: when I eat an apple, I don't remove the tail, so after moving to (3,4) and eating, my new list would be: head (3,4), then old head (3,3), then old body (2,3)? But after moving from (3,3) to (3,4), without eating, the list would be: new head (3,4), old head (3,3), old body (2,3)? But since I eat, I don't remove the tail, so I keep the old body? Let's see: initially after moving right to (3,3), my list is: head (3,3), body: (2,3), (2,4)? From earlier, after moving right without eating, from head (2,3) to (3,3), new list: head (3,3), body: old head (2,3), and old body1 (2,4)? So body segments: (2,3) and (2,4). Then if I move up to (3,4) and eat apple, then new head (3,4), and since I eat, I don't remove the tail, so new list: head (3,4), body: old head (3,3), old body1 (2,3), and I keep the old body2? But since I had only two body segments, after eating, I add one segment, so the new list should be: head (3,4), then old head (3,3), then old body1 (2,3), and then? Since I didn't remove the tail, I keep the old body2? But old body2 was (2,4)? But in the list, after moving right, the body was (2,3) and (2,4)? So when I move up to (3,4), the head moves, then the body shifts: the first body moves to old head (3,3), the second body moves to old first body (2,3), and since I eat, I don't remove the tail, so I keep the old second body? But the old second body was (2,4), so after moving, the new body would be: (3,3), (2,3), and then (2,4)? But that means the body has three segments: after head, we have (3,3), (2,3), (2,4)? But (2,4) is not connected? Let's think step by step.\n\nAfter moving right to (3,3) without eating:\n- Old list: [ (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) ]? No, from initial, after last move, my snake is: head (2,3), body [(2,4), (2,5)].\n- When I move right to (3,3) without eating:\n  - New head: (3,3)\n  - New body: [ old head (2,3), old body1 (2,4) ]? But what about old body2 (2,5)? Since I didn't eat, I remove the tail, so the new list is: [ (3,3), (2,3), (2,4) ]? So the tail is (2,4), and (2,5) is removed? But from the move, the body shifts: the first body moves to where head was, so from (2,4) to (2,3)? No, the first body segment moves to the old head position, so from (2,4) to (2,3)? But (2,3) is where the head was, so yes, the first body segment moves to (2,3). The second body segment moves to where the first body was, so from (2,5) to (2,4)? So after move, the segments are: head at (3,3), first body at (2,3), second body at (2,4)? So the list is: [ (3,3), (2,3), (2,4) ]? But then the tail is at (2,4), and the old tail (2,5) is gone. So yes.\n\nSo after moving right to (3,3), my snake has segments: (3,3), (2,3), (2,4).\n\nThen, if I move up to (3,4) and eat apple:\n- New head: (3,4)\n- Since I eat, I do not remove the tail, so the new list is: [ (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4) ]? But wait, the body should shift: the first body moves to old head (3,3), the second body moves to old first body (2,3), and since I eat, I keep the old second body, which is (2,4)? So the new body would be: (3,3), (2,3), (2,4)? But that means the snake has four segments: head (3,4), then (3,3), then (2,3), then (2,4). So the tail is at (2,4). So I grow by one segment.\n\nNow, from there, I can move to other apples. The apple at (3,7) is at (3,7), which is up three steps? From (3,4) to (3,7), I need to move up to (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). But are those cells safe? Currently, from board, at y=5, x=3 is '.'? From board row y=5: \" . . T . . . . . . . \" so at x=3, it's '.'? Similarly at y=6, x=3 is '.'? But at y=6, there is an apple at (6,6), but not at (3,6). So the path seems open. But I need to ensure that after moving, I don't hit my own body or other snakes. Since I grow, my body will be longer, so I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nBut for now, moving right to (3,3) seems a good first step.\n\nNow, what about the other moves? If I move down to (2,2), then from there, I might move to (1,2) or (3,2), but no apples nearby, so it might be less efficient.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left to (1,3), then I might move to (1,4) or (0,3), but no apples there immediately.\n\nSo, I think RIGHT is the best choice.\n\nTherefore, I will choose RIGHT.\n\nBut let's confirm if there is any immediate threat from enemy movement.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,9), and it has a long body. It might move towards the apples at (2,9) or (1,9). If it moves left, it might not affect me directly. But if it moves down, it might go towards (6,6) or (3,7). But since I'm at (2,3) moving to (3,3), I'm still away from that.\n\nSo, no immediate threat.\n\nThus, I decide to move RIGHT.\n\nSo, my final answer is RIGHT.Based on the current board state and snake positions, I need to choose a move that keeps me alive and positions me for future apple collection. My head is at (2,3), and my body segments are at (2,4) and (2,5). The apples are at (2,9), (1,9), (6,6), (3,4), and (3,7). The enemy snake is far away in the top-right corner.\n\nConsidering the four directions:\n- UP would move me to (2,4), which is currently occupied by my own body segment, so I would die.\n- DOWN would move me to (2,2), which is safe and open, but it moves me away from the closest apple at (3,4).\n- LEFT would move me to (1,3), which is safe but doesn't directly lead to an apple and might limit my options later.\n- RIGHT would move me to (3,3), which is safe and brings me one step closer to the apple at (3,4). From there, I can move up to eat the apple on the next turn.\n\nMoving RIGHT is the best choice because it increases my chance of safely eating the nearby apple while keeping multiple paths open for future moves.

I must ensure (4,4) is safe. The board shows no obstacles at (4,4).\n\nLong-term plan: Move UP to (4,4) to prepare to eat the apple at (3,4) on the next turn.

          "rationale": "**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nI need to ensure my survival to win. Currently, the only immediate threat is my own tail at (4, 4). Moving LEFT to (3, 4) or UP to (4, 5) are the only valid moves. Since LEFT gives me an apple, I will take it. The enemy snake #0 is far away and unlikely to intercept me in the next few turns given its current trajectory. After eating this apple, my next priority is to navigate towards the cluster of apples at the bottom of the board (e.g., (5, 1), (3, 1)) to increase my score while keeping my body flexible.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nCurrent Score: 3 (Snake #0: 7).\nTurn: 29 / 150.\nMy snake (ID 1) is at (3, 4) with body [(4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3)].\nThe board state provided at the start of the prompt shows the state after my previous move (LEFT). So I am currently at (3, 4).\nAvailable moves from (3, 4):\n1.  **LEFT to (2, 4):** Valid. Empty space. (x decreases to the left).\n2.  **RIGHT to (4, 4):** Invalid. My own body is at (4, 4). This is the tail connecting to my head. Moving here is immediate death.\n3.  **UP to (3, 5):** Valid. Empty space.\n4.  **DOWN to (3, 3):** Invalid. My own body is at (3, 3). Immediate death.\n\nSo, the safe moves are LEFT and UP.\n\nI need to decide which move maximizes my chance to win. Snake #0 has 7 apples and is quite long (8 segments). Their head is at (2, 9). They are far away. I am at 3 apples. I need to eat apples quickly to catch up.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (1, 9), (6, 6), (3, 7), (5, 1), (3, 1).\n- The closest apple to my current position (3, 4) that I can safely reach is likely one of the bottom ones or the one at (6, 6) or (3, 7).\n- If I move UP to (3, 5), I am closer to (3, 7) and (6, 6).\n- If I move LEFT to (2, 4), I am closer to the left edge and could eventually go for (1, 9), but that's a long path with the enemy snake potentially blocking.\n\nHowever, looking closely at the board state provided:\nRow 1: `1 . . . A . A . . . .`\nApples at (3, 1) and (5, 1) are on row 1.\nRow 4: `4 . . . 1 T . . . . .`\nWait, the board state at the start of the prompt shows `4 . . . 1 T . . . . .`\nThis implies that after my move to (3, 4), the cell (4, 4) is now my tail `T`.\nWait, the list of coordinates given was: Head (3, 4), Body: [(4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3)].\nSo the board state matches.\n\nMy goal is to get to the apples at the bottom.\nFrom (3, 4):\n- Down is blocked by (3, 3).\n- Right is blocked by (4, 4).\n- Up is open (3, 5).\n- Left is open (2, 4).\n\nIf I go UP to (3, 5), I can proceed up to (3, 6), then (3, 7) to eat that apple.\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 4), I am moving away from the apple at (3, 7) and towards the top-left corner where the enemy is. The enemy is at (2, 9) and (3, 9).\nIf I go LEFT, I might get trapped in the top-left corner. The enemy snake is long and occupies row 9.\nThe apples at (5, 1) and (3, 1) are very tempting.\nTo get to (3, 1) or (5, 1), I need to go down.\nBut currently, I cannot go down because (3, 3) is right below me.\nIf I move UP to (3, 5) or LEFT to (2, 4), my tail will move forward.\nCurrent tail is at (3, 3).\nIf I move UP: Head (3, 5), Body [(3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)]. Tail becomes (4, 3).\nIf I move LEFT: Head (2, 4), Body [(3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)]. Tail becomes (4, 3).\n\nWait, let's check the coordinates of the apples again.\nApples: (1, 9), (6, 6), (3, 7), (5, 1), (3, 1).\nI have 3 apples.\nSnake 0 has 7 apples.\nI need to catch up.\nThe apple at (3, 7) is straight up. Distance 3 (from y=4 to y=7).\nThe apples at (5, 1) and (3, 1) are down. Distance 3 (from y=4 to y=1).\nHowever, I cannot go down immediately because I am blocked by my own body at (3, 3). I would need to clear a path to go down.\nTo clear a path to go down, I could go LEFT or UP to let my tail move.\n\nLet's consider the threat from Snake #0.\nHead (2, 9).\nIt is on row 9.\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 4), I am moving closer to x=2. The enemy is at x=2, y=9.\nIf I go UP to (3, 5), I am moving closer to y=9.\nNeither brings me into immediate conflict, but if I go LEFT, I might run into the enemy if it decides to drop down. But the enemy is at the top, and I am at y=4. That's a large distance.\n\nThe main consideration is getting trapped.\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 4):\nI am at the left edge (x=2 is not the edge, 0 is). But x=1 has an apple at (1, 9).\nGoing LEFT puts me at (2, 4). From there, I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or potentially RIGHT (back to 3,4, which might be occupied by my body or empty depending on tail movement).\nActually, if I go LEFT to (2, 4), my body becomes [(3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)].\nSo (3, 4) is now my neck.\nIf I want to go DOWN later, I need to get to (3, 3). (3, 3) is currently occupied by the tail (4, 3)?\nWait, let's trace the body.\nCurrent: Head (3, 4). Body: (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3).\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 4):\nNew Head: (2, 4).\nNew Body: (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3).\nThe tail (3, 3) is gone.\nSo the cell (3, 3) becomes empty.\nThis opens up the path DOWN from (3, 4)!\nSo if I move LEFT to (2, 4), next turn I can move DOWN to (3, 3).\nThen I can continue DOWN to (3, 2), then (3, 1) to eat the apple.\nThis seems like a valid path.\n\nIf I move UP to (3, 5):\nNew Head: (3, 5).\nNew Body: (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3).\nThe cell (3, 3) is still occupied by (4, 3)? No, wait.\nCurrent tail is (3, 3).\nIf I move UP, the tail moves to follow the body.\nNew tail will be (4, 3).\nSo (3, 3) becomes empty.\nSo I can also go DOWN from (3, 4) next turn if I go UP now.\nSo both moves open up the path to the bottom apples.\n\nWhich path is safer?\nPath via UP:\n(3, 4) -> (3, 5) -> (3, 6) -> (3, 7) [Eat] -> ... -> (3, 6) -> (3, 5) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 1) [Eat].\nPath via LEFT:\n(3, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (3, 4) [If I turn back] or (2, 3) -> ... -> (3, 1).\nOr:\n(3, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 1) -> (3, 1) [Eat].\nNote: (3, 1) is an apple. (5, 1) is also an apple.\n\nLet's look at the board state.\nRow 1: `. . . A . A . . . .`\nSo (3, 1) and (5, 1).\nRow 2: `. . . . . . . . . .`\nRow 3: `. . . T T . . . . .`\nMy body is at (3, 3) and (4, 3).\nIf I go UP to (3, 5):\nMy body fills (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3).\nI can go to (3, 3) next turn.\n(3, 3) is currently my tail, but will be empty.\nSo I can go DOWN the column 3.\nColumn 3:\n(3, 4) [Body next turn]\n(3, 3) [Empty next turn]\n(3, 2) [Empty]\n(3, 1) [Apple]\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 4):\nI can go DOWN to (3, 3) next turn (since (3, 3) becomes empty).\nOr I can go LEFT to (1, 4).\nGoing LEFT to (1, 4) moves me towards the left edge.\nThe left edge is risky if I get cornered.\nSnake #0 is at (2, 9) and has body stretching to (8, 9).\nIt is unlikely to come down the left side immediately.\n\nHowever, if I go UP to (3, 5), I might encounter Snake #0 if it comes down, but it's on the right side (x=2 to 8).\nActually, Snake #0 is at y=9. I am at y=4.\nIf I go UP, I get closer to y=9. Snake #0 might stay at y=9 or move.\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN, it could head towards me.\nBut Snake #0 has 7 apples. It is likely hunting apples too.\nApples: (1, 9) is at top left. Snake #0 is at (2, 9). It will likely go for (1, 9).\nSo it might go LEFT to (1, 9).\nIf it does, it moves away from me.\n\nMy best bet is to secure the apples at the bottom.\nThe apple at (3, 1) is very close.\nTo get there, I need to go DOWN from (3, 4).\nCurrently blocked.\nIf I move UP to (3, 5), I unblock (3, 3).\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 4), I unblock (3, 3).\nSo I have to move UP or LEFT.\n\nIf I move UP to (3, 5), I am on the path to (3, 7) (apple) AND I can turn around and go down to (3, 1).\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 4), I am moving away from (3, 7) but can still go down.\nHowever, going LEFT puts me at x=2. The apple at (3, 1) is at x=3.\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 4), and then DOWN to (2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1).\nFrom (2, 1), I can go RIGHT to (3, 1) to eat the apple.\nPath A (UP): (3,4)->(3,5)->(3,6)->(3,7)[Eat]->(3,6)->(3,5)->(3,4)->(3,3)->(3,2)->(3,1)[Eat].\nPath B (LEFT): (3,4)->(2,4)->(2,3)->(2,2)->(2,1)->(3,1)[Eat].\n\nPath B seems shorter to the bottom apple (3, 1).\nLet's count turns to eat (3, 1) from (3, 4).\nPath A (via UP):\nTurn 29: Move UP to (3, 5). (Distance to y=1 is 4).\nTurn 30: Move UP to (3, 6). (Distance 5).\nTurn 31: Move UP to (3, 7) - Eat Apple. (Distance 6).\nTurn 32: Move DOWN to (3, 6). (Distance 5).\nTurn 33: Move DOWN to (3, 5). (Distance 4).\nTurn 34: Move DOWN to (3, 4). (Distance 3).\nTurn 35: Move DOWN to (3, 3). (Distance 2).\nTurn 36: Move DOWN to (3, 2). (Distance 1).\nTurn 37: Move DOWN to (3, 1) - Eat Apple. (Distance 0).\nTotal turns to eat (3, 1): 8 turns (Turn 29 to 37).\n\nPath B (via LEFT):\nTurn 29: Move LEFT to (2, 4). (Distance to y=1 is 3). But I need to go to (2, 1) then (3, 1).\nTurn 30: Move DOWN to (2, 3). (y=3).\nTurn 31: Move DOWN to (2, 2). (y=2).\nTurn 32: Move DOWN to (2, 1). (y=1).\nTurn 33: Move RIGHT to (3, 1) - Eat Apple. (y=1, x=3).\nTotal turns to eat (3, 1): 4 turns (Turn 29 to 33).\n\nPath B is significantly faster to get the first apple. However, Path A gets the apple at (3, 7) first.\nScore is 3 vs 7. I am behind.\nEating (3, 7) gives +1. Eating (3, 1) gives +1.\nIf I can get (3, 1) faster, I get points faster.\nBut if I go LEFT, I am moving towards the left wall.\n(0, 0) is the bottom left.\nIf I go to (2, 1), I am at x=2. I can go to (3, 1).\nIs there any threat?\nSnake #0 is at (2, 9). It is very far.\nI should prioritize getting points quickly.\nPath B gets a point in 4 turns.\nPath A gets a point in 3 turns (to (3, 7)), but then takes 5 more turns to get the second point.\nWait, if I take Path A, I get (3, 7) in 3 turns.\nThen I can go down.\nPath A: Turn 29 UP, Turn 30 UP, Turn 31 UP (Eat). Score 4.\nTurn 32 DOWN, Turn 33 DOWN, Turn 34 DOWN, Turn 35 DOWN, Turn 36 DOWN (Eat). Score 5.\nPath B: Turn 29 LEFT, Turn 30 DOWN, Turn 31 DOWN, Turn 32 DOWN, Turn 33 RIGHT (Eat). Score 4.\nPath B gets me to Score 4 in 4 turns (Turn 33).\nPath A gets me to Score 4 in 3 turns (Turn 31).\nPath A gets me to Score 5 in 8 turns (Turn 37).\nPath B gets me to Score 5 in... wait, after eating (3, 1) at (3, 1), I need another apple.\nApples remaining: (1, 9), (6, 6), (5, 1). (3, 7) and (3, 1) are eaten.\n(5, 1) is at (5, 1). From (3, 1), I can go RIGHT to (4, 1), (5, 1).\nThat's 2 moves.\nSo Path B: Turn 33 (Eat 3,1). Turn 34 (RIGHT). Turn 35 (RIGHT/Eat 5,1). Score 5.\nTotal 6 turns.\nPath A: Turn 37 (Eat 3,1). Score 5.\nSo Path B is much better for gaining points quickly (Score 5 in 6 turns vs Score 5 in 37 turns).\n\nWait, my calculation for Path A assumes I must return to (3,1) from (3,7).\nBut maybe I can eat (3,7), then eat (6,6)?\n(3, 7) to (6, 6): dx=3, dy=1.\n(3, 7) to (5, 1): dx=2, dy=6.\n(3, 7) to (1, 9): dx=2, dy=2.\n(3, 7) to (3, 1): dx=0, dy=6.\nThe closest is (1, 9).\nIf I go UP to (3, 7), I can then go LEFT to (2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9).\nOr go diagonally.\nBut let's go back to Path B vs Path A.\nPath B gets me to the bottom apples quickly.\nThe bottom apples are (3, 1) and (5, 1).\nThese are clustered.\nThe top apples are (1, 9) and (6, 6).\nThe enemy snake #0 is at (2, 9).\n(1, 9) is contested.\n(6, 6) is open, but far.\nThe bottom cluster is safer and faster for me.\n\nSo I should choose Path B (LEFT).\nWait, is LEFT safe?\nFrom (3, 4) to (2, 4).\nIs (2, 4) on the board? Yes, x=2 is valid (0-9).\nIs it occupied?\nBoard state:\nRow 4: `. . . 1 T . . . . .`\nWait, the board state shows:\nRow 9: `. A 0 T T T T T T .`\nRow 4: `. . . 1 T . . . . .`\nMy head is at (3, 4).\nI need to check (2, 4).\nRow 4: `. . . 1 T . . . . .`\nThis represents x=0 to 9.\nSo index 0: '.' (0, 4)\nIndex 1: '.' (1, 4)\nIndex 2: '.' (2, 4)\nIndex 3: '1' (3, 4) -> My head\nIndex 4: 'T' (4, 4) -> My body\nSo (2, 4) is indeed empty.\nSo LEFT is valid.\n\nIs UP valid?\n(3, 5).\nRow 5: `. . . . . . . . . .`\nAll empty.\nSo UP is valid.\n\nWhy choose LEFT over UP?\nGoal: Eat bottom apples fast.\nPath B (LEFT) allows me to reach (3, 1) in 4 turns.\nPath A (UP) requires me to go UP, then DOWN.\nPath B puts me on the x=2 column, then I can go down.\nFrom (2, 1) I can go to (3, 1) or (1, 1).\n(3, 1) is an apple.\n(5, 1) is also an apple at x=5.\nFrom (3, 1), I can go to (4, 1), (5, 1).\nPath B aligns me with the bottom row.\n\nHowever, there is a slight risk.\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 4), and then DOWN to (2, 3), etc.\nI am approaching y=1.\nBoard row 1: `. . . A . A . . . .`\nRow 2: `. . . . . . . . . .`\nRow 3: `. . . T T . . . . .`\nWait, Row 3 shows my tail at (3, 3) and (4, 3).\nIf I go LEFT, my body moves.\nTurn 29 (LEFT): Head (2, 4). Body [(3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)].\nTurn 30 (DOWN): Head (2, 3). Body [(2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)].\nTurn 31 (DOWN): Head (2, 2). Body [(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)].\nTurn 32 (DOWN): Head (2, 1). Body [(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)].\nTurn 33 (RIGHT): Head (3, 1). Body [(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)].\nThis path is valid.\n\nIf I go UP:\nTurn 29 (UP): Head (3, 5). Body [(3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)].\nTurn 30 (UP): Head (3, 6). Body [(3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 4)].\nTurn 31 (UP): Head (3, 7) [Eat]. Body [(3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4)].\nTurn 32 (DOWN): Head (3, 6). Body [(3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5)].\n...\nThis path is also valid.\n\nThe difference is strategy.\nSnake #0 has 7 apples. I have 3.\nI need to catch up.\nBottom apples are (3, 1) and (5, 1).\nTop apples are (1, 9), (6, 6), (3, 7).\n(3, 7) is close to me if I go UP.\n(1, 9) is close to Snake #0.\n(6, 6) is far away.\n(5, 1) and (3, 1) are 2 apples.\n(3, 7) is 1 apple.\nIf I go LEFT, I can get 2 apples quickly.\nIf I go UP, I get 1 apple quickly, then I have to travel far for the next one (unless I go down to the bottom apples).\n\nLet's compare the \"Score per Turn\" potential.\nSnake #0 has 7. To win, I need at least 8, probably more (game ends at 50 or turn 150).\nTurn 29 is early.\nI am behind.\nI should maximize points.\nThe bottom cluster has 2 apples. The top has 3 apples (1,9), (6,6), (3,7).\nBut (1,9) is contested by Snake #0.\n(6,6) is far.\n(3,7) is close.\n(3,1) and (5,1) are close.\nActually, from (3, 4):\nTo (3, 7): 3 moves up. 1 apple.\nTo (3, 1): 3 moves down (if I can). 1 apple.\nTo (5, 1): 5 moves down+right. 1 apple.\nTo (1, 9): 5 moves up+left. 1 apple.\nTo (6, 6): 5 moves up+right. 1 apple.\n\nThe board state shows I cannot go down immediately.\nSo (3, 1) is not 3 moves away. It's 3 moves away + 1 move to clear the blockage.\nWait.\nIf I go LEFT now:\nTurn 29: (2, 4).\nTurn 30: (2, 3).\nTurn 31: (2, 2).\nTurn 32: (2, 1).\nTurn 33: (3, 1) [Eat].\n5 moves to eat (3, 1).\n\nIf I go UP now:\nTurn 29: (3, 5).\nTurn 30: (3, 6).\nTurn 31: (3, 7) [Eat].\n3 moves to eat (3, 7).\n\nThen, to get to the bottom apples from (3, 7):\nTurn 32: (3, 6).\nTurn 33: (3, 5).\nTurn 34: (3, 4).\nTurn 35: (3, 3).\nTurn 36: (3, 2).\nTurn 37: (3, 1) [Eat].\nTotal 8 moves to eat (3, 1) starting from now.\n\nSo, going UP gets me 1 point in 3 turns.\nGoing LEFT gets me 1 point in 5 turns.\nBUT, going LEFT puts me in a better position to get the second point (5, 1) soon after.\nFrom (3, 1):\nTurn 33: (3, 1) [Eat].\nTurn 34: (4, 1).\nTurn 35: (5, 1) [Eat].\n2 moves to second point.\nTotal 5 moves for 2 points (Turns 29-33 for first, 34-35 for second? No).\nLet's re-calculate totals.\n\nStrategy 1 (UP): Chase (3, 7), then bottom.\n- T29: UP (3, 5)\n- T30: UP (3, 6)\n- T31: UP (3, 7) [Eat 4th apple]\n- T32: DOWN (3, 6)\n- T33: DOWN (3, 5)\n- T34: DOWN (3, 4)\n- T35: DOWN (3, 3)\n- T36: DOWN (3, 2)\n- T37: DOWN (3, 1) [Eat 5th apple]\n- T38: RIGHT (4, 1)\n- T39: RIGHT (5, 1) [Eat 6th apple]\nTotal 11 turns to reach 6 apples (Current 3 -> 6).\n\nStrategy 2 (LEFT): Chase (3, 1), then (5, 1).\n- T29: LEFT (2, 4)\n- T30: DOWN (2, 3)\n- T31: DOWN (2, 2)\n- T32: DOWN (2, 1)\n- T33: RIGHT (3, 1) [Eat 4th apple]\n- T34: RIGHT (4, 1)\n- T35: RIGHT (5, 1) [Eat 5th apple]\nTotal 6 turns to reach 5 apples.\nFrom there, I can go for (6, 6) or others.\n\nStrategy 2 is clearly better for rapid scoring.\n\nHowever, is there a risk of collision with Snake #0?\nSnake #0 is at (2, 9).\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 4), I am on the same X column (x=2).\nSnake #0 is on y=9.\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN, it will come towards me.\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN every turn:\n- T29: (2, 8)\n- T30: (2, 7)\n- T31: (2, 6)\n- T32: (2, 5)\n- T33: (2, 4)\nWait. If I am at (2, 4) on T29, and Snake #0 is at (2, 9).\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN 5 times, it will be at (2, 4) on T33.\nMy timeline:\nT29: (2, 4)\nT30: (2, 3)\nT31: (2, 2)\nT32: (2, 1)\nT33: (3, 1)\n\nSo if Snake #0 moves straight down:\n- T29: Snake #0 moves to (2, 8). I am at (2, 4). Safe.\n- T30: Snake #0 moves to (2, 7). I am at (2, 3). Safe.\n- T31: Snake #0 moves to (2, 6). I am at (2, 2). Safe.\n- T32: Snake #0 moves to (2, 5). I am at (2, 1). Safe.\n- T33: Snake #0 moves to (2, 4). I am at (3, 1). Safe.\n\nSo even if Snake #0 comes straight down, we miss each other.\nBut what if Snake #0 moves to (3, 4) or something?\nSnake #0's body is at (3, 9), (4, 9)...\nIf Snake #0 moves LEFT (to 1, 9), it stays at y=9.\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT (to 3, 9), it stays at y=9.\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN, it goes to (2, 8).\nThe only way Snake #0 hits me is if it moves DOWN 5 times AND I stay on x=2.\nBut I am moving DOWN and then RIGHT.\nSo it seems safe.\n\nWhat if Snake #0 moves to (3, 1) or (5, 1) simultaneously?\nSnake #0 is at (2, 9).\nDistance to (3, 1): 8 vertical, 1 horizontal. Impossible in 4 turns.\nDistance to (5, 1): 8 vertical, 3 horizontal.

(1, 5) is not occupied by Snake #0's body.\n    *   Let's check head-on collision.\n        *   Snake #0 is at (1, 8). It can move DOWN to (1, 7), LEFT to (0, 8), or RIGHT to (2, 8). It cannot move UP because that's outside the board (y=9 is top, y=8 is below it). Actually, the board is 0-9. If it's at y=8, UP is y=9. Wait, the board is 10x10. Y ranges from 0 to 9.\n        *   Snake #0 head is (1, 8). UP is (1, 9). That cell is currently occupied by its own body (first body segment is (1, 9)). So Snake #0 cannot move UP.\n        *   Can Snake #0 move to (1, 5) in one turn? No, it's too far. It moves one cell per turn.\n    *   So, moving UP to (1, 5) seems physically safe from immediate collision.\n    *   However, let's look at the context. I am at (1, 4). My body extends to (4, 4). If I go UP to (1, 5), I have just moved *away* from my body. My tail is at (4, 4). The gap at (0, 4) and (1, 4) (my previous head) will be open.\n    *   Wait, the prompt says \"My head is at (1, 4)\". The body list is [(2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)]. So the snake is 4 segments long.\n    *   If I go UP to (1, 5), the new head is (1, 5). The body becomes [(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)].

If it moves DOWN, it goes to (1, 7). If I go UP to (1, 5), we don't collide.\n    *   Is it safe from my future self? If I go UP, I move away from my body. This is generally safer than moving closer, as it opens up space.\n    *   However, looking at the *Rationale* provided from the previous turn, the strategy was to go LEFT to head to the bottom row apples.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate the previous move. The previous turn, the head was at (3, 4). The move LEFT was chosen. This moved the head to (1, 4).\n    *   Wait, if the head was at (3, 4) and moved LEFT, the new head would be (2, 4).\n    *   But the prompt says \"Current Head: (1, 4)\".\n    *   Let's look at the \"Last Move Information\".\n    *   It says: \"My last move information: ... LEFT\".\n    *   It says: \"Current Head: (3, 4)\" in the rationale of the last move.\n    *   And now, \"Your snake (ID: 1): - Head: (1, 4)\".\n    *   There is a discrepancy or I am misinterpreting the flow.\n    *   Let's look at the board state *now*.\n    *   Row 4: `. 1 T T T . . . . .`\n    *   This maps to indices 0-9.\n        *   (0, 4) = .\n        *   (1, 4) = 1 (Head)\n        *   (2, 4) = T (Body)\n        *   (3, 4) = T (Body)\n        *   (4, 4) = T (Body)\n    *   So the current state is: Head (1, 4), Body (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4).\n    *   The previous state (from the rationale) was: Head (3, 4), Body (4, 4) ... etc.\n    *   If the previous head was (3, 4) and it moved LEFT, the new head is (2, 4).\n    *   But the current head is (1, 4).\n    *   Let's look at the \"Apples collected: 3\".\n    *   Wait, did I eat an apple?\n    *   Apples are at: (6, 6), (3, 7), (5, 1), (3, 1), (9, 1).\n    *   My current position (1, 4) is not an apple.\n    *   So why is the head at (1, 4)?\n    *   Maybe the previous move was LEFT, but the \"Turn: 31\" implies this is the state *before* I make my move for turn 31? Or *after*?\n    *   \"Turn: 31 / 150\"\n    *   \"Your last move information\" - this refers to the move I made in the *previous* turn (Turn 30).\n    *   So for Turn 31, I am at (1, 4).\n    *   How did I get to (1, 4) from (3, 4) via LEFT?\n    *   (3, 4) -> LEFT -> (2, 4).\n    *   Maybe the previous head was (2, 4) and it moved LEFT to (1, 4)?\n    *   Or maybe the description of the previous state \"Current Head: (3, 4)\" in the rationale was hypothetical or from a different point in the reasoning? No, it says \"Current Head: (3, 4)\" in the rationale block for the *last* move.\n    *   Let's trust the *current* board state provided.\n    *   Current Head: (1, 4).\n    *   Body: [(2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)].\n    *   Let's map this to the board:\n        *   (1, 4) -> Head\n        *   (2, 4) -> Body\n        *   (3, 4) -> Body\n        *   (4, 4) -> Body\n    *   Okay, that matches the board row 4: `.` `1` `T` `T` `T`.\n    *   So, the state is confirmed. The previous move must have resulted in this state.\n    *   If the previous move was LEFT, and the previous head was (2, 4), then (1, 4) is correct.\n    *   If the previous head was (3, 4), moving LEFT puts me at (2, 4).\n    *   There is a disconnect. However, the *current* state is the ground truth. I must move from (1, 4).\n\n    *   **Analyze moves from (1, 4):**\n        *   **UP (1, 5):**\n            *   Target: (1, 5).\n            *   Board check: Row 5 is `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.`.

(1, 7) contains an apple `A`.\n        *   If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (1, 7), it eats an apple and grows.\n        *   If I move UP to (1, 5), I am at (1, 5).\n        *   If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (1, 7).\n        *   If I move UP to (1, 5), and Snake #0 moves DOWN to (1, 7), we are not colliding.\n        *   However, moving *towards* the enemy is generally risky. The enemy might decide to charge down. If Snake #0 moves to (1, 7), and I move to (1, 5), the distance is 2. Next turn, if I move UP and it moves DOWN, we collide at (1, 6).\n        *   So moving UP puts me on a collision course with Snake #0.\n        *   Snake #0 is large (9 segments). It has to be careful too.\n        *   The apple at (3, 7) is very close to Snake #0. Snake #0 will likely go for that or the one at (1, 7).\n        *   If I move UP, I am entering the \"danger zone\" of Snake #0.\n        *   If I move DOWN, I am moving away from Snake #0. This is safer regarding the immediate head-on collision.\n        *   If I move LEFT, I am moving away from Snake #0. Also safer.\n\n        *   **Long term plan from previous turn:** \"snake down to the bottom row to clear the two uncontested apples ((3, 1) and (5, 1))\".\n        *   To get to (3, 1) and (5, 1), I need to go DOWN and then RIGHT.\n        *   My current head is (1, 4).\n        *   To go DOWN, I can move to (1, 3).\n        *   To go to the bottom apples (y=1), I need to decrease y.\n        *   Current y=4. Target y=1.\n        *   So DOWN is the direction towards the bottom row apples.\n\n        *   Let's check DOWN safety in more detail.\n        *   Target (1, 3). Empty.\n        *   Is it safe from my body *next turn*?\n        *   If I move DOWN to (1, 3), my new body will be [(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)].\n        *   The tail (4, 4) moves off.\n        *   So I won't hit myself.\n\n        *   What about UP?\n        *   Target (1, 5). Empty.\n        *   Moves me towards Snake #0.\n        *   Snake #0 is at (1, 8). The board shows an apple at (1, 7) on the board view `7 . . . A . . . . . .`.\n        *   Wait, the apple list says Apples at: (6, 6), (3, 7), (5, 1), (3, 1), (9, 1).\n        *   (1, 7) is not in the apple list. The board view shows `A` at index 3. So (3, 7) is an apple.\n        *   The board view at row 7 is `7 . . . A . . . . . .`.\n        *   So (3, 7) is an apple.\n        *   The board view at row 1 is `1 . . . A . A . . . A`.\n        *   So (3, 1), (5, 1), (9, 1) are apples.\n        *   The board view at row 6 is `6 . . . . . . A . . .`.\n        *   So (6, 6) is an apple.\n        *   The board view at row 8 is `8 . 0 . . . . . . . .`.\n        *   This matches the apple list.\n        *   There is *no* apple at (1, 7) in the list. The board view at row 7 `7 . . . A` has the A at index 3. So (3, 7).\n        *   So Snake #0 is at (1, 8).\n        *   Apples near Snake #0: (3, 7).\n        *   Apples near me: (3, 1), (5, 1) are far (y=1 vs y=4).\n        *   Apples near me: (6, 6), (9, 1) are also far.\n\n        *   **Decision:**\n        *   Moving UP is dangerous because it moves towards Snake #0. Even if there's no collision this turn, it limits my escape routes and brings me into its hunting ground.\n        *   Moving DOWN moves me towards the bottom row apples (as per the long-term plan).\n        *   Moving LEFT moves me to the edge (x=0). This might be a trap if I go all the way left.\n        *   Moving RIGHT moves me into my own body.\n        *   So the viable options are DOWN or LEFT.\n        *   DOWN aligns with the plan to get to bottom apples.\n        *   Is there any threat from Snake #0 if I go DOWN?\n        *   Snake #0 is at (1, 8). It can only move DOWN (to 7), LEFT (to 0,8), or RIGHT (to 2,8).\n        *   It is unlikely to come down to y=3 in one turn.\n        *   Is there any threat to (1, 3)?\n        *   My body is at (2,4), (3,4), (4,4).\n        *   If I go DOWN, my new head is (1, 3).\n        *   My body follows. (1,4) becomes body.\n        *   So I need to check if (1, 3) is safe from *future* self? No, immediate move.\n        *   Is it safe from *other* snakes? Snake #0 is far.\n        *   Is it safe from walls? Yes.\n\n        *   Let's double check the \"Last Move\" context.\n        *   \"Rationale: ... By moving LEFT, I clear my tail from (3, 3), opening a path to move DOWN in future turns.\"\n        *   \"Conclusion: LEFT is the only safe move...\"\n        *   It seems the previous move was indeed LEFT.\n        *   If the previous move was LEFT, and the head moved from (2, 4) to (1, 4), then my body is now (2, 4), (3, 4)... and the tail (4, 4) is leaving.\n        *   The path DOWN from (1, 4) is (1, 3). Is it blocked?\n        *   Row 3 is all empty.\n        *   So moving DOWN is safe.\n\n        *   Why did the previous rationale say \"LEFT... opening a path to move DOWN\"?\n        *   It implies that before the last move, DOWN was blocked or risky.\n        *   If the head was at (3, 4) and I wanted to go DOWN to (3, 3), that might have been blocked by something.\n        *   Let's look at the board state *before* the last move (Turn 30).\n        *   I don't have that state.\n        *   But I have the current state.\n        *   Current state: Head (1, 4).\n        *   Goal: Get to bottom apples.\n        *   Path: Down.\n        *   Safety: Check UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n        *   UP (1, 5): Safe, but moves towards enemy.\n        *   DOWN (1, 3): Safe, moves towards goal.\n        *   LEFT (0, 4): Safe, moves towards edge.\n        *   RIGHT (2, 4): Unsafe (Body).\n\n        *   Comparing DOWN vs LEFT:\n        *   DOWN: Moves towards apples (3, 1), (5, 1). Decreases y.\n        *   LEFT: Moves towards x=0. Increases distance to apples (all x >= 3 except (9,1)).\n        *   If I go LEFT to (0, 4), I am at the edge. Next turn I might be forced to go UP or DOWN. I am stuck in a narrow corridor.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (1, 3), I am in the open.\n        *   So DOWN is better than LEFT.\n\n        *   Comparing DOWN vs UP:\n        *   UP moves towards enemy. Risky.\n        *   DOWN moves away from enemy. Safe.\n        *   DOWN moves towards goal.\n        *   UP moves away from goal.\n        *   So DOWN is clearly better than UP.\n\n        *   So the best move seems to be DOWN.\n\n        *   Let's verify one more time if (1, 3) is truly safe.\n        *   My head: (1, 4).\n        *   Move DOWN -> (1, 3).\n        *   Is (1, 3) on the board? Yes.\n        *   Is (1, 3) occupied by my body?\n            *   Body: (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4).\n            *   (1, 3) is not in this list.\n            *   Wait, I should check if moving into the space *occupied by my tail* is safe.\n            *   My tail is at (4, 4). I am moving to (1, 3). Distance is large.\n            *   The rule says \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n            *   And \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n            *   My current head is (1, 4). The cell \"behind\" my head is (2, 4) (where my body starts).\n            *   Moving DOWN to (1, 3) is not backwards (backwards would be RIGHT to (2, 4)). So it's safe from that rule.\n            *   So (1, 3) is empty of my body.\n\n        *   Is (1, 3) occupied by Snake #0? No, Snake #0 is at (1, 8).\n        *   Is (1, 3) occupied by Snake #0's body? No, its body is at y=9.\n        *   So (1, 3) is safe.\n\n        *   The strategy is to go DOWN.\n        *   The prompt asks me to output just one word.\n        *   I will write DOWN.\n        *   I should also include a long-term plan as requested.\n        *   The previous plan was to go to bottom apples. I am continuing that.\n        *   \"Move DOWN to (1, 3). Continue path towards bottom row to target apples at (3, 1) and (5, 1).\"\n\n        *   Wait, I need to make sure I don't look like I'm just blindly following the previous plan if the situation has changed.\n        *   Situation check:\n        *   Enemy at (1, 8). I am at (1, 4). I am moving DOWN. Enemy is above. No immediate collision risk.\n        *   My path: (1, 4) -> (1, 3) -> ... -> (3, 1) -> (5, 1).\n        *   Is there any obstacle in the way?\n        *   Row 3 is empty.\n        *   Row 2 is empty.\n        *   Row 1 has apples.\n        *   Looks clear.\n\n        *   One detail: \"If I move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point.\"\n        *   (1, 3) is not an apple.\n        *   So I won't grow.\n        *   My tail will move from (4, 4) to (3, 4).\n        *   So my body will become: Head (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4).\n        *   This is valid.\n\n        *   Final check on the \"Last Move\" discrepancy.\n        *   The text says \"Last Move: LEFT\".\n        *   The text says \"Current Head: (1, 4)\".\n        *   If the head was (2, 4) and moved LEFT -> (1, 4). Consistent.\n        *   If the head was (3, 4) and moved LEFT -> (2, 4). Inconsistent.\n        *   The board state shows (1, 4) as head.\n        *   The body list in the text is `[(2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)]`.\n        *   This matches the board perfectly.\n        *   So I trust the board.\n        *   I trust the head at (1, 4).\n        *   I will move DOWN.\n\n        *   One small worry: Snake #0's size.\n        *   It has 8 apples. It is 9 segments long (head + 8 body).\n        *   It is at (1, 8). Body stretches to (8, 9).\n        *   It is very long. It might be trapped or turning.\n        *   However, it is far away from me. Distance 4 in Y.\n        *   It is not an immediate threat for a head-on collision unless it moves DOWN 4 times (which takes 4 turns).\n        *   I should be safe for the next turn.\n\n        *   Let's review the \"Rules and win conditions\" again.\n        *   \"If you move directly backwards into your own body... you die.\"\n        *   Current head (1, 4). Behind is (2, 4). I am not moving there.\n        *   \"If two snake heads move into the same cell... both die.\"\n        *   Snake #0 is at (1, 8). If it moves DOWN to (1, 7), and I move DOWN to (1, 3), no collision.\n        *   If it moves DOWN to (1, 7), and I move DOWN to (1, 3). No collision.\n        *   If it moves DOWN to (1, 7), and I move UP to (1, 5). Distance 2.\n        *   If it moves DOWN to (1, 7), and I move UP to (1, 5). Next turn... if it goes DOWN to (1, 6) and I go UP to (1, 6). Collision.\n        *   This reinforces that moving UP is risky (collision path).\n        *   Moving DOWN is safe (diverging paths).\n\n        *   Decision: DOWN.\n        *   Plan: Continue down towards bottom apples.\n\n        *   Wait, is there any risk from my own tail?\n        *   My body is [(2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)].\n        *   The tail is (4, 4).\n        *   If I move DOWN, the new head is (1, 3).\n        *   The new body is [(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)].\n        *   The old tail (4, 4) is vacated.\n        *   Is (1, 3) safe?

But trapped at x=0.\n        *   What if I move UP?\n        *   Head (1, 5).\n        *   Body [(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)].\n        *   Safe. But closer to enemy.\n\n        *   DOWN is the best move.\n\n        *   **Double check the coordinates.**\n        *   Y increases UP.\n        *   X increases RIGHT.\n        *   (1, 4) -> DOWN -> (1, 3). Correct.\n\n        *   **Long-term plan:**\n        *   \"Continue descent to bottom row. Target apples (3, 1) and (5, 1).

Bad.\n            *   LEFT: Moves to edge, restricts future moves. Less optimal than DOWN.\n            *   DOWN: Moves towards goal (bottom apples), safe, open space.\n            *   RIGHT: Into body. Deadly.\n        *   Action: Move DOWN to (1, 3).\n        *   Long term: Get to y=1 and eat apples.\n\n        *   I will output the plan and then DOWNMy head is at (1, 4). I am currently in the center-left of the board. Snake #0 is located at (1, 8), directly above me.\n\n**Safety Analysis:**\n- **UP (1, 5):** This move moves me towards Snake #0. While it is technically empty, it puts me on a collision course with the larger enemy snake. If Snake #0 moves DOWN, we risk a head-on collision in the coming turns. This is too risky.\n- **LEFT (0, 4):** This move places me at the edge of the board (x=0). While safe for this turn, it restricts my movement options in the future and moves me away from the apples located at higher x-coordinates.\n- **DOWN (1, 3):** This is empty. It moves me away from Snake #0, ensuring safety from head-on collisions. It also aligns perfectly with my long-term strategy to reach the bottom row where the apples at (3, 1) and (5, 1) are located.\n- **RIGHT (2, 4):** My own body segment is at (2, 4). Moving here is instant death.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe gap with Snake #0 (3 vs 8 apples) is significant. I need to secure points efficiently. The bottom row offers two apples in close proximity. By moving DOWN now, I begin the descent towards these safe points while maintaining maximum distance from the immediate threat at (1, 8).\n\nMove DOWN to descend towards bottom row apples. Maintain distance from Snake #0 at (1, 8). Target apples at (3, 1) and (5, 1).\nDOWN",

Moving LEFT takes me away from them towards the corner (0, 1).

Moving here would be moving backwards into myself, which is fatal. **DEADLY.**\n- **RIGHT (3, 1):** This cell contains an apple 'A'. It appears empty of snakes. **SAFE.**\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nI have identified that **RIGHT** is the only safe move that leads to an immediate apple. I am currently at 3 apples and need to close the gap with Snake #0 (who has 9). Securing this point is crucial to staying competitive.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options for future safety:\n- Moving **UP** to (2, 2): This is safe, but it moves me away from the cluster of apples on row 1 ((5,1), (9,1)) and into the center of the board where Snake #0 is currently lurking (around y=6-7). This might increase the risk of a head-on collision later.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (2, 0): This is safe, but it traps me against the bottom wall. This reduces my maneuverability to just LEFT, UP, or RIGHT, which is risky in the long run.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**RIGHT** is the optimal move. It is safe, scores a point immediately, and keeps me on the bottom row where I have a clear path to other apples ((5,1), (9,1)) and away from the immediate danger zone of the enemy snake.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Let's evaluate the four possible moves:\n- **UP (3, 2):** The board state shows a 'T' (Snake #0 body part) at (3, 3). (3, 2) appears to be empty. However, moving UP takes me into the middle of the board, potentially boxing me in between Snake #0's body on the left and the wall on the right. It also brings me closer to the enemy head at (4, 6).\n- **DOWN (3, 0):** This cell is empty. Moving here keeps me along the bottom wall. This is **SAFE**.\n- **LEFT (2, 1):** This is my current neck. Moving here is moving backwards, which is fatal. **DEADLY**.\n- **RIGHT (4, 1):** This cell contains an apple 'A' (from the list at (5, 1)? No, checking the board visual... actually the board visual shows `1 . T T 1 . A . . . A`. Let's look at the coordinate (4, 1). It is empty in the visual, but the apple list contains (5, 1) and (4, 2). Wait, looking at the row 1: `1 . T T 1 . A . . . A`. The snake head is at 3. The cell to the right (4) is empty. The cell (5) is empty? No, (5,1) is an apple. (6,1) is empty. (9,1) is an apple. So (4, 1) is **SAFE** and open.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nMy goal is to catch up to Snake #0 (9 apples vs 4). I need to eat efficiently.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (3, 0) is safe, but traps me at the bottom wall with limited maneuvering room.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (4, 1) is safe. It moves me towards the cluster of apples on row 1 ((5,1) and (9,1)). It keeps me in an open area.\n- Moving **UP** to (3, 2) is dangerous because I might get stuck or cornered by Snake #0's body at (3, 3) and (2, 3).\n\n**Plan for Next Turn:**\nMove RIGHT to (4, 1). From there, I have a clear path to the apple at (5, 1). After eating that, I can navigate towards (9, 1). I must keep an eye on Snake #0 at (4, 6) to ensure I don't cross paths with it later.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**RIGHT** is the best move. It is safe, scores points (setting up to eat soon), and maintains good positioning.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

This vertical alignment is strong for the next turn, potentially opening up an attack or a safe path upwards if Snake #0 moves away. The snake body at (4, 6) is to my left, so I am not crowding it immediately.\n- **UP to (4, 2)** eats an apple at (4, 2).

          "rationale": "**START RATIONALE**\n**Safety Analysis:**\nMy head is at (6, 1).\n- **LEFT (5, 1):** This is my previous body segment (immediately behind the head). Moving here is a direct collision with myself. **DEADLY.**\n- **UP (6, 2):** The board shows this cell is empty. It is safe.\n- **DOWN (6, 0):** The board shows this cell is empty. It is safe.\n- **RIGHT (7, 1):** The board shows this cell is empty. It is safe. There is an apple at (9, 1) further to the right.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- **Snake #0:** Currently at (6, 7). The gap between us is narrowing. If I move UP, I enter (6, 2), and they might move DOWN. If they move DOWN to (6, 6) (which is currently part of their body but will vacate as they move), they could potentially kill me if I am at (6, 2) and they land on my tail? No, we swap positions. The danger is if they move DOWN to (6, 6) and I move UP to (6, 2), we don't collide. However, if they move DOWN and I move UP, we are getting closer. If they move DOWN to (6, 6) and I move UP to (6, 2), the distance is 4 segments. If they move DOWN to (6, 5) (empty), I move UP to (6, 2). That's risky.\n- Actually, looking at the board, (6, 2) is empty. (6, 3), (6, 4) are empty. (6, 5) is empty. (6, 6) is Snake #0's body.\n- If I move UP to (6, 2), I am on the same column as Snake #0. This is the \"death spiral\" risk. If Snake #0 moves DOWN, we could end up head-to-head at (6, 3) and (6, 2) (if they move 2 down, but they only move 1).\n- Wait, if I am at (6, 2) and they are at (6, 7):\n    - If they move DOWN to (6, 6) (body), they die immediately on their own body? No, their body moves. (6, 7) -> (6, 6), the tail (3, 9) leaves. (6, 6) becomes the head. The old head (6, 7) becomes body.\n    - If I move UP to (6, 2), and they move DOWN to (6, 6), we are not colliding.\n    - **THE REAL DANGER:** If I move UP to (6, 2) and they move DOWN to (6, 6), we are on the same column. If I then move UP to (6, 3) and they move DOWN to (6, 5), we are getting closer.\n    - **CRITICAL:** If I am at (6, 2) and they are at (6, 7), and they decide to rush me (Move DOWN), eventually we will meet head-to-head at (6, X). Since I am moving UP and they are moving DOWN, if we meet at (6, 4) and (6, 4) on the same turn, we die. If I am at (6, 3) and they are at (6, 5), and I move UP to (6, 4) and they move DOWN to (6, 4), we die.\n- **Conclusion:** Being on the same X-axis as the opponent is extremely risky if they decide to chase. Since Snake #0 has a massive lead (11 apples to 5), they likely want to survive. But if they want to eliminate me, moving DOWN is the way to do it.\n- **Why RIGHT is safer:** Moving RIGHT to (7, 1) moves me OFF the deadly column X=6. This guarantees I cannot die from a head-on collision with Snake #0 this turn (they are at X=6, I would be at X=7).\n- **Why RIGHT is better strategically:**\n    1.  **Escape the Crosshairs:** It puts space between me and the opponent.\n    2.  **Apple Path:** It moves towards the apple at (9, 1). (7,1) -> (8,1) -> (9,1).\n    3.  **Future Flexibility:** From (7, 1), I can still go UP or DOWN. I am not trapped against the wall (I have space to the right and left).\n- **Why UP is bad:** It aligns me with the opponent. It moves me into the center of the board where Snake #0 is active.\n- **Why DOWN is bad:** It moves me to (6, 0). From (6, 0), I can only go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. If I go DOWN now, I am trapped at the bottom edge. If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (6, 6), I am stuck at the bottom wall. If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (6, 6), and I am at (6, 0), and I want to survive, I have to move LEFT or RIGHT. If I go LEFT to (5,0), I am safe. But I am still at the bottom.\n- **Comparing (7,1) vs (6,0):** (7,1) is closer to the apple at (9,1). (7,1) is not on the opponent's column.\n- **Comparing (7,1) vs (6,2):** (7,1) avoids the potential head-on collision. If I go to (6,2) and opponent goes DOWN to (6,6), I am setting myself up for a collision next turn if they continue down. By going RIGHT, I break the column alignment.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move **RIGHT** to (7, 1). This is the safest move to avoid the opponent and the most direct path to the apple at (9, 1).\n**END RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

The board shows `1` at (8, 0) and `T` at (9, 0). This represents my current body. Since the entire snake moves forward, my body at (9, 0) will move to (8, 0) this turn. If I move Right to (9, 0), I am moving into the cell my body *just* vacated. In standard Snake rules (and based on the prompt's note about \"backwards into your own body\"), moving into the cell immediately behind the head is a collision. However, looking closer at the board state:\n    ```\n     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    0 . . . A A . . . 1 T\n    ```\n    My head is `(8,0)` (indicated by `1`). My tail is `(9,0)` (indicated by `T`). Wait, the prompt says \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\" and \"Coordinates: (8,0) Head\". The board visual shows `1` at column 8 and `T` at column 9 on row 0.\n    The snake body is: `Head: (8, 0), Body: [(9, 0), (9, 1), ...]`.\n    If I move RIGHT, I go to (9, 0). In standard Snake, as the snake moves, the tail (9,0) vacates, and the segment (8,0) becomes the new tail (or moves to 9,0? No, the whole chain shifts). Actually, the prompt says \"All snakes move simultaneously\". My body is currently occupying (9,0). If I move Right, I am trying to step into (9,0). Is that cell occupied *before* the move? Yes. The body segment is there. Hitting an occupied body segment kills you. **DEADLY.** (Unless it's the tail and it moves away, but usually you can't step on the tail unless it moves away *during* the same move. If I move, I step into (9,0) while the body is still there. The tail moves to (8,0)? No, the tail moves *from* (9,0) *to* (8,0) if it follows the head. Wait. The head is at (8,0). The next segment is at (9,0). This is unusual. Usually coordinates increase from head to tail. Here `[(9, 0), ...]` is the body. The snake is essentially facing 'Left' (decreasing x) if the head is at 8 and the neck is at 9? Or maybe it's wrapped?\n    Let's look at the board again.\n    `0 . . . A A . . . 1 T`\n    Index 8 is `1`. Index 9 is `T`.\n    The snake list is: `Head: (8, 0)`, `Body: [(9, 0), (9, 1), ...]`.\n    So the head is at 8, the next segment is at 9. This means the \"body\" extends to the right of the head. This implies the head is currently facing LEFT.\n    If I move **RIGHT** to (9, 0), I am moving into a cell currently occupied by my own body segment. Even if that segment moves, standard Snake rules usually forbid stepping into a body part. Let's assume it is deadly to step into a currently occupied body part.\n    Let's check the other moves.\n    - **LEFT (7, 0):** The board shows `.` (empty). No snakes. **SAFE.**\n    - **UP (8, 1):** The board shows `T` at (8, 1)? Let's check the board lines.\n    Line 1: `1 . . A . T T T T T T`\n    Column 8 is `T`. So (8, 1) is occupied by my body. **DEADLY.**\n    - **DOWN (8, -1):** Off board. **DEADLY.**\n\n    Wait, let's re-read the board coordinates. 0 is bottom. Row 0 is bottom.\n    Row 0: `0 . . . A A . . . 1 T`\n    Row 1: `1 . . A . T T T T T T`\n    My snake: Head (8,0), Body starts (9,0).\n    Looking at Row 1, columns 4-9 are `T T T T T T`. That matches my body list: (9,1), (8,1), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1).\n    Looking at Row 0: columns 8 is `1` (Head), column 9 is `T` (Tail/Body start).\n    So my snake runs from (4,1) -> ... -> (9,0) -> (8,0). This is a loop or a fold. (8,0) is next to (9,0).\n    \n    Let's verify the moves again.\n    If I move **RIGHT** to (9,0): Currently occupied by `T`. If I move there, I crash. **DEADLY.**\n    If I move **LEFT** to (7,0): Empty. **SAFE.**\n    If I move **UP** to (8,1): Currently occupied by `T` (from Row 1). **DEADLY.**\n    If I move **DOWN**: Off board. **DEADLY.**\n\n    There is only one safe move: LEFT.\n\n    **Strategic Analysis:**\n    I am at the bottom row. Moving Left keeps me in row 0. There are apples at (4,0) and (3,0) and (4,2). Moving Left gets me closer to (7,0), (6,0), etc. I need to navigate around my own body which is blocking the row above and the cell to the right.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\nLEFT",
