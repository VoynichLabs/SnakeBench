The closest apple to me is at (2, 9), directly above my head.\n2. Moving UP would put me on the apple at (2, 9), which is optimal.\n3. All other directions (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe but do not immediately collect an apple.\n\n**Safe Moves Analysis:**\n- UP (2, 4): Safe (apple at (2, 9))\n- DOWN (2, 2): Safe (empty space)\n- LEFT (1, 3): Safe (empty space)\n- RIGHT (3, 3): Safe (empty space)\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n1. UP is the best move as it immediately collects the apple at (2, 9).\n2. After eating, my body will grow, and I will need to avoid moving DOWN (back into my body).\n3. The enemy is not an immediate threat, but I should monitor their movements toward the apples at (8, 2) and (8, 1).\n\n**Best Move:**\nUP is clearly the best choice as it:\n- Immediately collects an apple.\n- Continues my path toward the apple cluster.\n- Does not put me in immediate danger.\n\n**Long-term Note:**\nAfter this move, I will have a body segment at (2, 4). Next turn, I should avoid moving DOWN (back into my body). I should continue moving toward the remaining apples, especially the one at (2, 9), while keeping an eye on the enemy's movements.\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**",
