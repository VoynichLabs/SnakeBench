DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT don't reach immediate apples. Favor UP for growth and flexibility, moving toward the apple cluster in the top-right (e.g., (7,9)-(8,9)).\n\n**Strategy Note to Self:**\nAiming for the top-right apple cluster ((7,9), (8,9)) since they're close and dense, allowing quick growth while avoiding the enemy in the center. After eating (8,9), prioritize left to (7,9). If enemy approaches, keep space open; target 5-10 apples early to secure a lead.\n\nUP",

No nearby apple, but this advances southward per strategy (closer to bottom-row apples: (3,0), (7,0), etc.). Keep multiple follow-ups (left/right turns possible later in open space).\n- LEFT (6,8): Opens west path (e.g., to Y=7-0 via west cells). Shifts toward center (X=6) but away from east bottom apples; respectable openness (down to Y=7, left to X=5-4, right back to X=7). No nearby apple eat.\n- RIGHT (8,8): Opens east path near board edge (X=8). Limited by right wall (X=9 off-limits); down options exist but tighter space (enemy-free, but closer to edge). Positions for possible apple (8,5) later but not direct; fewer long-term escapes vs. DOWN/LEFT.\n\nPrioritize DOWN: Directly executes south shift for growth (bottom apples in view after 2-3 turns), maximizes follow-ups without edge risks. LEFT is viable alternative if turning west helps circle, but south is targeted. Avoid RIGHT for potential edge trap.\n\nEnemy (head at 5,0) will move (likely LEFT or RIGHT to (4,0) or (6,0)); no immediate collision risk with any safe move (separated by Y delta).\n\n**Strategy Note to Self:** Continue southward via DOWN/LEFT to access bottom row apples ((1,0), (3,0), (7,0), (8,0)). After 1-2 south moves, pivot east/west if needed to chain eats without self-trapping near walls. Monitor enemy; if it heads north, adjust to block or evade.

Actually, might have been eaten last turn (Turn 3 likely reflects state after movement & eating last turn). Yes \u2014 Turn 3 started with my head at (5,0) and body at (5,1), meaning I ate an apple at (5,0) last turn. So (5,0) apple is gone.  \n\nNearby apples: check list: (7,0), (3,0), (1,0), nearby y=0 left and right. Also (5,4) far.  \n\n**Check moves:**  \n\n1. **UP** from (5,0) \u2192 (5,1): body segment? Yes \u2014 body currently at (5,1), so that\u2019s suicide (move into own body). So UP is invalid.  \n\n2. **LEFT** from (5,0) \u2192 (4,0):  \n   - Not off board.  \n   - No snake body there: Snake #1 far away.  \n   - Not my body.  \n   - Visible threats: Snake #1 could move anywhere, but not likely to reach (4,0) in one move from (7,8). Check possible collisions: Snake #1 head moves this turn to one of (7,7),(6,8),(7,9),(8,8). Not close to (4,0). So safe.  \n\n3. **RIGHT** from (5,0) \u2192 (6,0):  \n   - Same reasoning \u2014 board clear except possible apple at (7,0) ahead. No immediate blockage. Could move toward apple (7,0).  \n\n4. **DOWN** from (5,0) \u2192 (5,-1): invalid \u2014 off board.  \n\nSo possible moves: LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Which is better?**  \n- Apple at (7,0) is in direction right\u2192right\u2192up.  \n- Apple at (3,0) is in direction left\u2192left.  \nAlso (1,0) farther left, y=0 is apple-rich.  \n\nBut consider Snake #1 position: It\u2019s way up at (7,8), apples up there too. If I go right toward (7,0), eventually I travel up into its territory when lengths grow. But too early to worry.  \n\nLooking at board: My body blocks UP. So after LEFT or RIGHT, next turn I won\u2019t be trapped because UP will be free (unless body follows to my old position? After this move: Body will move from (5,1) to (5,0) since I ate recently so body grows).  \n\nActually recheck:  \nApples collected: 1 before last turn; after eating (5,0) last turn, now apples collected = 2 (must check: scores say \u201cyour snake apples: 1\u201d \u2014 Wait! That\u2019s confusing \u2014 maybe that\u2019s old info.)  \n\nFrom initial state text:  \n\u201cYour snake (ID: 0): Apples collected: 1\u201d \u2014 That\u2019s current state given at start of Turn 3. But my head is at (5,0) and body at (5,1), so I must have eaten the apple at (5,1) last turn, not (5,0)? Wait, let\u2019s trace:  \n\nEarlier turn: Head (5,1), move DOWN \u2192 (5,0), apple at (5,0)? Yes, apple list includes (5,0)? No, checking apple list: (0,2), \u2026, (5,4), etc. Apple at (5,0) not listed! So no apple at (5,0). So no growing \u2014 So why body length 2? Because apple earlier at (5,1) maybe? Head (5,2) turn before \u2192 (5,1) turn 2 ate apple at (5,1)? Then body would be [(5,2)]. But current body is [(5,1)], so maybe Turn 2 ate apple at (5,1), then moved to (5,0) without eating apple (Turn 3 now starting). That makes sense:  \n\nSequence:  \nTurn 2: head (5,2) \u2192 DOWN to (5,1) \u2014 apple at (5,1) eaten \u2192 body becomes [(5,2)].  \nTurn 3: head (5,1) \u2192 moved DOWN to (5,0) \u2014 no apple \u2014 body follows to [(5,1)] keeping length 2.  \n\nYes \u2014 so current body (5,1) is the only segment.  \n\nThus possible moves from (5,0):  \n- UP: (5,1) \u2014 body \u2014 invalid  \n- DOWN: off board \u2014 invalid  \n- LEFT: (4,0) \u2014 safe  \n- RIGHT: (6,0) \u2014 safe  \n\nSo exactly two options.  \n\n**Better choice:**  \nRight (6,0) leads toward center and apples at (7,0). Left (4,0) leads toward many apples at lower x but also potentially more open space long-term.  \n\nBeing near center gives more options. But checking immediate next turn: if I go LEFT to (4,0), body moves to (5,0), so next turn from (4,0) possible moves: UP (4,1), LEFT (3,0) apple, DOWN off board invalid. So at least 2 moves next turn.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (6,0), body at (5,0), next turn from (6,0) possible moves: UP (6,1), RIGHT (7,0) apple, DOWN invalid \u2192 2 moves also.  \n\nEqual safety.  \n\nLet\u2019s choose RIGHT to go toward (7,0) apple next turn.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (6,0), likely eat (7,0) soon, then have options to go up. Snake #1 is far away, so safe to collect apples on bottom row first.\n\nRIGHT",

But after that, head at (7,0), next turn moves are UP (7,1), RIGHT (8,0), LEFT (6,0) is my body \u21d2 only 2 moves possible.  \n- UP (6,1): no apple, body moves to (5,0) since no apple eaten, but next turn from (6,1) will have UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all possibly clear (Snake #1 far away). More options next turn.  \n\nLooking at apple positions: y=0 has apples at (7,0) and others leftwards. If I take apple now (RIGHT), good for score, but reduces future flexibility slightly because I\u2019m on the edge. If I go UP, I can come back later for apples while keeping space open.  \n\nSnake #1 is at (7,7) with length 3, likely heading toward apples at upper part \u2014 not an immediate threat to me.  \n\nChoosing UP keeps more future options open and avoids trapping myself along the bottom edge too early.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (6,1), consider moving toward (5,4) or (7,0) later while keeping distance from enemy.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

After this 2nd south move, can pivot east/west on next turn to target middle-row eats like row5's apples at x=1,2,3,8 if nearby. Best for sustained advancement without immediate edge proximity.\n- LEFT (6,7): Shifts westward, potentially toward central apples (e.g., row1-2 eats) but deviates from targeted south path; still open, but prioritizes strategy to reach bottom first.\n- RIGHT (8,7): Risks right-edge confinement (x=8), limiting future rights and crowding options despite being safe; avoid for trap potential.\n\nPrioritize DOWN: Executes 2nd south step per plan, preserving paths to eats and escapes.

Monitor if enemy ascends; if it blocks south path or eats bottom apples prematurely, switch to west pivot or circle east at y=5.

However, positions snake at x=8 edge with body obstructing left (new body will occupy (7,5),(7,6),(7,7)), limiting future moves to only UP (8,6) and DOWN (8,4); risk of trapping in right-side corner with reduced maneuverability, forcing me to zig-zag slowly toward distant apples like (5,4) if heading down. Enemy at (5,1) not an immediate collision threat, but this choice prioritizes a quick eat at the cost of flexibility.\n- DOWN (7,4): Continues south momentum, aligns with previous strategy of reaching lower rows. Positions closer to row4 apple at (5,4) and leaves multiple exits (can LEFT/RIGHT/UP next turn from (7,4)). Allows zig-zagging northwest toward the row4 apple or eastward if needed. However, somewhat deviates from the denser row5 apple cluster (x=1-3 on y=5), and enemy might block or compete in the bottom area if it moves north.\n- LEFT (6,5): Shifts west mid-row, directly toward the row5 apple cluster ((1,5),(2,5),(3,5) at x=1-3, with (8,5) nearby but bypassed for now). Preserves south momentum less strictly but enables chaining multiple eats in 1-2 turns (e.g., from (6,5) LEFT to (5,5) -> (4,5) empty -> (3,5) eat, then (2,5) eat). Keeps multiple exits open (can UP/DOWN/RIGHT after), avoids edge confinement entirely, and positions for quick apple accumulation without traps. Enemy poses no predicted head-on collisions, as it's far south.\n\nPrioritize LEFT: Aligns with prior plan to pivot west from (7,5) for row5 chaining, offering the best balance of immediate progress toward multiple nearby apples while maintaining open escapes and flexibility. Avoids the trap-risk of RIGHT and the potentially slower zig-zang pace of DOWN. After this move, from (6,5), prioritize continuing west via LEFT to eat (3,5) next (possibly (5,5)->(4,5)->(3,5)), monitoring enemy for bottom interference\u2014ready to swing south to row4 if row5 blocks or enemy threatens.\n\n**Strategy Note to Self:** Chaining west to row5 apples (target 3+ eats in next 1-2 turns from (6,5)->(5,5)->(4,5)->(3,5)->(2,5)). If opportunity arises (no blocks), zigzag down to row4 (5,4) for bonus eat. Stay central to avoid edges; flank north past row5 if enemy ascends aggressively toward bottom eats.

No head-on collision risk this turn (too far).  \n\n**Apple seeking and future mobility:**\n- UP (5, 2): Puts me closer to apples at y=3, y=5, etc. Next turn options: UP (5, 3), DOWN (5, 1) \u2013 body will be at (6,1) and (5,1) will be free? Wait: moving from (5,1) to (5,2) without eating apple \u2192 body = [(5,1), (6,1)]. So next turn, DOWN from (5,2) goes to (5,1) which is my body then \u2192 blocked. So next turn valid: UP (5,3), LEFT (4,2), RIGHT (6,2) = 3 moves.  \n- DOWN (5, 0): Near apples at (3,0), (1,0), (7,0) but far from most clusters. Next turn: from (5, 0), body = [(5,1), (6,1)]. UP (5,1) blocked by body, so only DOWN (5,-1) invalid (off board), LEFT (4,0) free, RIGHT (6,0) free \u2192 only 2 moves (trapped along bottom edge). Risky.  \n- LEFT (4, 1): Moves toward dense apples at left side. Next turn: body = [(5,1), (6,1)]. From (4,1): UP (4,2), DOWN (4,0), LEFT (3,1) free, RIGHT (5,1) blocked \u2192 3 moves. Also leads to more open space and apple cluster.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nMove toward the apples on left side (many at x=0-3) to build score while enemy is on right. Avoid corners/edges to keep mobility.\n\nBest choice: **LEFT** toward apple-rich area and good future options.\n\nLEFT",

Current state recap:**  \n- My snake (ID 0): Head = (4, 1), Body = [(5, 1)], length 2 (1 apple eaten).  \n- Enemy snake #1: Head = (6, 5), Body = [(7, 5), (7, 6)], length 3 (2 apples eaten).  \n- Many apples, notably dense on left side.\n\n**2. Possible moves from (4, 1):**  \n- UP: (4, 2) \u2013 free (board shows empty), safe.  \n- DOWN: (4, 0) \u2013 free (apple at (3,0)/etc., but (4,0) looks empty from ASCII art), safe.  \n- LEFT: (3, 1) \u2013 free, safe.  \n- RIGHT: (5, 1) \u2013 my body \u2192 suicide. Not valid.  \n\nSo valid moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**3. Immediate danger (enemy #1 possible moves this turn):**  \nEnemy head at (6, 5). Possible moves:  \n- UP (6, 6) \u2013 empty  \n- DOWN (6, 4) \u2013 empty  \n- LEFT (5, 5) \u2013 empty  \n- RIGHT (7, 5) \u2013 own body (segment #2 after head collision check? Actually segment positions after movement \u2013 rules: simultaneous move.) Wait \u2014 careful: Enemy body coords: [(7, 5), (7, 6)]. That's behind them; currently they are at head (6, 5), so body segment immediately behind head is (7, 5).  \n\nEnemy\u2019s possible destinations next turn:\n- UP (6,6): empty  \n- DOWN (6,4): empty  \n- LEFT (5,5): empty  \n- RIGHT (7,5): contains its own body segment currently at (7,5) \u2014 but if they move right, their head goes to (7,5), which is currently occupied by their own body **next segment**? Dangerous? Actually simultaneous move: when they move, body follows, so (7,5) becomes head\u2019s new position, the old head (6,5) becomes body segment 1, old body segment 1 (7,5) shifts to segment 2 position (7,6), etc. \u2014 check: length=3: head at (6,5), body (7,5), (7,6). Moving right to (7,5): collision with body segment 1? YES \u2014 they cannot move right into (7,5) immediately \u2014 that's suicide for them! Similarly, LEFT for them to (5,5) is safe, UP (6,6) safe, DOWN (6,4) safe. So their only safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\nSo their options won\u2019t intersect my possible moves this turn. My possible positions after move: (4,2), (4,0), (3,1). They're far away; no possible head-on collision this turn.\n\n**4. Future mobility after possible moves:**  \n\n- **UP (4, 2)**:  \n  - Body becomes [(4,1), (5,1)] next turn.  \n  - Next turn from (4, 2): moves: UP (4,3) free, DOWN (4,1) body (tail? \u2014 body: [(4,1),(5,1)] \u2014 oh, is (4,1) body next turn? Yes, so blocked. So DOWN blocked.  \n  - LEFT (3,2) free (apple there), RIGHT (5,2) free. So 3 moves possible after. Takes me closer to apples at (3,2), (0,3), etc.  \n\n- **DOWN (4, 0)**:  \n  - Leaves body at [(4,1),(5,1)]  \n  - Next turn from (4,0): UP (4,1) blocked, DOWN off-board invalid, LEFT (3,0) free (apple), RIGHT (5,0) free. Only 2 moves. Trapped along bottom edge less mobility.  \n\n- **LEFT (3, 1)**:  \n  - Body: [(4,1),(5,1)] next turn.  \n  - Next turn from (3,1): UP (3,2) apple, DOWN (3,0) apple, LEFT (2,1) free, RIGHT (4,1) body blocked. So 3 possibilities. Closer to dense apples at left side.  \n\n**5. Strategy:**  \nThe apples are dense near left side (several at x=0-3, y=0-3). Moving LEFT puts me deeper into apple-rich area. UP also acceptable but slightly less direct into densest cluster. Avoid DOWN which restricts mobility.\n\nBest choice seems **LEFT** or **UP**; LEFT directly progresses towards high apple density at low x while keeping options.\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\nContinue harvesting apples on left side (x=0-3) while monitoring enemy's position on the right. Try to grow while keeping escape routes open. Avoid boxing self into corners.\n\nLEFT",

Provides exits LEFT (5,6), UP (6,7), RIGHT (7,6). Positions closer to row6 apple chain starting at (0,6), but deviates from row5 cluster focus and could lead to scouting north. Enemy at (4,1) poses no immediate threat, but this might spread efforts thinly.\n\n- DOWN (6,4): Empty cell in row 4, safe. After move, snake positions: head (6,4), body (6,5), tail (7,5). Offers exits LEFT (5,4\u2014apple eat potential), UP (6,5\u2014back into self? After move, (6,5) becomes body, so UP invalid next turn; instead safe LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN but limited vertical). Direct path to (5,4) apple for immediate eat, aligning with south momentum from last turn, but risks edge confinement at x=5-6 bottom with fewer exits if chasing more. Better for single eat but slower than row5 chain.\n\n- LEFT (5,5): Empty cell in row 5, safe. After move, snake positions: head (5,5), body (6,5), tail (7,5). Strong exits: UP (5,6), DOWN (5,4\u2014apple),RIGHT (6,5\u2014back into own body after move, but safe next turn would be UP/LEFT/DOWN), LEFT (4,5). Directly advances west toward row5 apple cluster ((3,5)), enabling 2-3 turn chain: to (4,5) empty \u2192 (3,5) eat \u2192 (2,5) eat \u2192 possibly (1,5) eat. Maintains flexibility, avoids edges, and maximizes short-term gains while monitoring enemy (which could move north, e.g., to row2, potentially interfering bottom but not row5).\n\n- RIGHT (7,5): Into own body segment at (7,5), illegal (dies).\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nAmong safe moves, evaluate for apple access and openness:\n- LEFT to (5,5) best balances immediate progress toward multiple nearby apples ((3,5) in 2 turns, potential for (2,5)/(1,5) after) with 3+ safe follow-up exits. Continues strategic west pivot from last turn, avoiding RIGHT's growth risk now and DOWN's limited bottom mobility. No predicted head-on collisions; enemy far south likely heads north or stays in bottom for its own apples ((3,0),(7,0), etc.).\n\n**Strategy Note to Self:** Chain west along row5: from (5,5) go LEFT to (4,5) \u2192 (3,5 eat) \u2192 (2,5 eat) \u2192 (1,5 eat if clear). After third eat (~turn 10), assess: pivot south to row4 (5,4) or north/east if enemy closes in. Aim for 4+ apples by turn 10, prioritize central areas for escapes. If row5 blocked or enemy ascends (e.g., to y=2), switch to DOWN from midway point for (5,4).\n\nLEFT",

Enemy at (3,1) could move up to (3,2) for an apple, but no direct interference yet.\n\n- DOWN (5,4): Occupied by apple, safe and leads to immediate eat and growth. After move, snake positions: head (5,4), body (5,5), (6,5), (7,5). Offers exits LEFT (4,4), RIGHT (6,4), DOWN (5,3). Provides quick point gain but confines to row4-5 corridor with fewer vertical options post-move and leaves row5 chain untouched; enemy likely prioritizes bottom eats, so low collision risk, but slower long-term chaining than west.\n\n- LEFT (4,5): Empty cell, safe. After move, snake positions: head (4,5), body (5,5), (6,5). Strong exits: UP (4,6), DOWN (4,4), LEFT (3,5\u2014apple), RIGHT (5,5\u2014back into body). Directly enables east-west chaining west along row5: (4,5) \u2192 (3,5 eat) \u2192 (2,5 eat) \u2192 (1,5 eat potential), aligning with last turn's west pivot. Maintains openness, multiple escapes, and maximizes nearby apple access (up to 3 eats in 2-3 turns) while monitoring enemy southern containment.\n\n- RIGHT (7,5): Own body at (6,5), illegal (would die upon entry).\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nAmong safe, LEFT to (4,5) best advances the row5 chain toward sequential eats ((3,5) in 1 turn, then (2,5), (1,5)), offers 3+ future exits to avoid traps, and keeps south/fallback options open. DOWN's immediate eat is tempting but limits to 3 exits near board center, potentially slowing vs. chaining west. UP explores north but dilutes row5 focus. No likely head-on collisions; enemy focused south on (3,0)/(2,1)/(3,2) apples.\n\n**Strategy Note to Self:** Chain west along row5 from (4,5): LEFT to (3,5 eat) \u2192 LEFT (2,5 eat) \u2192 LEFT (1,5 eat if empty). After 2-3 eats (apples ~4-5 by turn 11-12), pivot: if enemy ascends (e.g., via (3,2)), switch to DOWN from midway for (5,4) or southeast toward (8,1)/(8,0). Prioritize central escapes; if trapped after (1,5), shift north to row6 chain ((0,6)/(5,8)) or south to row4. Avoid edges; retarget if north apples ((5,8)/(6,9)) become closer.\n\nLEFT",

Offers exits DOWN (4,5\u2014back into body), LEFT (3,6\u2014empty), UP (4,7\u2014empty), RIGHT (5,6\u2014empty). This shifts northward away from the concentrated row5 apple chain towards potential (0,6) or upper apples, but reduces immediate eating chances and leaves the row5 opportunities untouched; enemy at (3,2) might move UP to (3,3) for space, no current interference, but this dilutes focus from chaining.\n\n- DOWN (4,4): Empty cell, safe. After move, snake positions: head (4,4), body (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). Offers exits UP (4,5\u2014back into body), LEFT (3,4\u2014empty), DOWN (4,3\u2014empty), RIGHT (5,4\u2014apple). Moves southward toward (5,4) apple for possible immediate eat, with good escapes, but abandons the row5 west chain and limits progress toward central apples; enemy southern at (3,2) could block if advancing, low risk but slower multi-apple gain.\n\n- LEFT (3,5): Occupied by apple, leads to safe eat and growth. After move (and eat), snake positions: head (3,5), body (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). Offers strong exits UP (3,6\u2014empty), DOWN (3,4\u2014empty), LEFT (2,5\u2014apple). Enables continuing the row5 west chain: immediately positions for next LEFT to (2,5 eat), then (1,5 eat), potentially 2+ eats in 2 turns with multiple escape routes (avoiding RIGHT into own body, as it's backward). Keeps options open post-chain (e.g., UP for north or DOWN for south apples); enemy far south, unlikely to collide this turn.\n\n- RIGHT (5,5): Occupied by own body, illegal (backward move into segment directly behind head, per rules).\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nAmong safe, LEFT to (3,5) best continues the prioritized row5 west chaining toward sequenced eats ((2,5) in 1 turn, (1,5) in 2 turns), adds a point (apples ~3), and maximizes future exits (at least 2 post-move, with north/south pivots if needed vs. the row5 chain). DOWN offers one eat but fewer chain options and risks southern confinement if enemy ascends; UP explores but misses row5 density. No head-on risks; enemy likely stays low on bottom apples like (2,1)/(3,0).\n\n**Strategy Note to Self:** Continue row5 west chain: LEFT to (2,5 eat in turn 10, position ~head (2,5)) \u2192 if empty, LEFT to (1,5 eat, head (1,5) with apples ~4-5). Monitor length/position: post-(1,5), snake ~4-5 segments; if trapped (e.g., enemy at (3,3), RIGHT into body), pivot UP to row6 for (0,6) or north toward (5,8)/(8,7), or DOWN to (4,4)/(5,4). Retarget south if apples deplete (fallback to (1,1)/(2,1)/bottom); avoid edges/backs RU/SOUTH toward center. Aim for apples > enemy (at 3).\n\nLEFT",

UP is okay but delays apple. RIGHT is mobility-poor.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nAfter LEFT to (2,2), next turn go DOWN to (2,1) for apple, then assess path to (1,3) or (0,3). Keep enemy in mind \u2014 they may go for (3,5) apple. Stay in left half to collect apples while enemy is on right.\n\nLEFT",

Enables pivot to south apples like (5,4) or bottom row, escapes available, but dilutes focus from dense row5 chain; enemy south at (2,2) might eat nearby (2,1), low risk of interference but misses row5 sequence.\n\n- LEFT (2,5): Occupied by apple, safe eat. After move (and eat), snake positions: head (2,5), body (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5). Offers exits UP (2,6\u2014empty), DOWN (2,4\u2014empty), LEFT (1,5\u2014apple, next eat in 1 turn), RIGHT (3,5\u2014back into body). Extends row5 west chain: positions for immediate LEFT to (1,5 eat, apples ~5), 4+ segments post-eat; multiple escapes, avoids trapping, and leverages apple density (potential 2 eats in 2 turns); enemy far south, no collision risk this turn (they may DOWN to (2,1) apple or LEFT to (1,2) space).\n\n- RIGHT (4,5): Occupied by own body, illegal (backward into segment behind head).\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nAmong safe, LEFT prioritizes continuing row5 west apple chain for sequenced eats ((1,5) next turn, apples ~5), maximizes points/scoring lead while keeping 2+ exits and adaptability. UP explores north but loses immediate eat-chain progress. DOWN enables (5,4) pivot but fewer chained options and southern confinement risk vs. row5 density. No head-on threats; enemy's south positioning favors left chain continuation.\n\n**Strategy Note to Self:** After LEFT eat to apples ~4, continue LEFT to (1,5 eat in turn 11, apples ~5). If empty post-(1,5), assess escapes at head (1,5): UP to (1,6) toward (0,6) apple/north, or DOWN to row4 toward (5,4). Avoid LEFT to (0,5) if risking tight spot (e.g., back RIGHT into body death, left off-board); pivot UP if enemy (Snake#0 at ~y=1-3) blocks south or if chain ends. Aim apples >~5 vs. enemy ~3; retarget south or upper apples (e.g., (6,9),(8,7)) if row5 depletes, while staying >1 escape and avoiding edges/backs RU/SOUTH.\n\nLEFT",

Wait, check: last turn enemy apples = 4, now enemy apples = 4, so they ate an apple? Actually last turn enemy head at (2, 5) now head at (2, 5)? No\u2014last turn my snake moved to (2, 1).\n\nActually careful: I misread? Let me verify:\n\nLast turn: My head was at (2, 2) last turn, enemy head at (3, 5), now my head at (2, 1) (I moved DOWN to apple), enemy head now at (2, 5). So enemy moved LEFT from (3, 5) to (2, 5) and ate an apple? No apples at (2, 5) listed? Wait apples listed: (1, 5) yes, (0, 6), etc. Not at (2,5). So enemy didn\u2019t eat apple last turn\u2014 so enemy length still 4? But they have 4 apples like me. Actually if they started length 5 (4 apples + head), yes their length is 5 segments now. Wait their apples last turn: 4 apples, length 5. So same length as me now.\n\nOkay, enemy head at (2, 5), body: (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5) \u2014 length 5.\n\n**Possible enemy moves from (2, 5)**:\n- UP: (2, 6) \u2192 free\n- DOWN: (2, 4) \u2192 free\n- LEFT: (1, 5) \u2192 apple present\n- RIGHT: (3, 5) \u2192 body segment \u2014 invalid.\n\nEnemy valid: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Collision risk**: Could enemy move to (1, 5) if I move to (1, 1)? No, different cells. Simultaneous collision only if we swap heads? Not possible here because our heads aren\u2019t adjacent.\n\nBut check adjacency: My head (2, 1) and enemy head (2, 5): Distance = 4 in y-direction \u2014 safe separation.\n\nHead-on possible this turn? Enemy could move DOWN twice? No, just one move. The only way to collide heads is if enemy goes LEFT to (1, 5), DOWN to (1, 4), etc.? Not possible in one move. So no direct collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Evaluate my moves**:\n\n1. **DOWN to (2, 0)** \u2014 safe, no apple there. Next moves from (2, 0): up (blocked body at (2, 1) once tail moves \u2014 wait tail is at (4, 1). Actually path: future moves ok but further from apples on left.  \n\n2. **LEFT to (1, 1)** \u2014 apple there, so I grow to length 6. From (1, 1), next turn: possible moves:\n   - UP: (1, 2) safe\n   - DOWN: (1, 0) safe and has apple\n   - LEFT: (0, 1) safe\n   - RIGHT: (2, 1) body? yes, body currently at (2, 1) but tail moves forward, so next turn (2, 1) will be empty unless my neck is there? Let's check: current body: H(2,1) \u2192 neck (2,2) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (3,1) \u2192 tail (4,1). After move LEFT to (1,1), new body: H(1,1) add old head? Or apple eating growth: new body segments: Head(1,1), old neck (2,1) becomes segment, then (2,2), (3,2), (3,1), tail (4,1) \u2014 so length 6. So (2,1) becomes a body segment next turn. So moving RIGHT next turn from (1,1) to (2,1) would be suicide. So RIGHT blocked next turn. So LEFT yields 3 safe moves after this turn.\n\nLEFT gets apple, adds length advantage (5\u21926), enemy length 5. Good.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy next move risk**:\nEnemy at (2,5) can go LEFT to (1,5)\u2014apple, grow to length 6 too. But no threat to me this turn.\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT, LEFT gets apple, gains score, keeps flexibility with apples at (1,0), (0,1), (1,3) nearby for future.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nJust ate apple at (1,1), now length 6. Enemy will match length if they eat soon. Left side has apples at (1,0), (0,1). Consider going toward (0,1) then (0,0)? Avoid boxing in. Check open area: maybe move toward bottom left cluster to deny enemy path.\n\n---\n\n**Final decision**:  \nLEFT",

No, board shows 1 at (1,6) but maybe that's head. Apple list has (1,7) and (1,3) near them.  \n\n**Risk assessment:**  \nEnemy head is 6 vertical steps away ((1,6) vs (1,0)), so no immediate collision risk this turn.  \nBut if I go LEFT to (0,0), my next possible moves: UP(0,1), RIGHT(1,0) (body), DOWN off board. That's a risky dead end unless I plan to reverse.  \nGoing RIGHT to (2,0) gives more options: UP(2,1) is my body (blocked), DOWN off board, RIGHT(3,0) empty, so still limited.  \nActually both moves put me in a tight spot next turn.  \n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nApples nearby: (0,0) if LEFT, (3,0), (8,0), (7,0), (0,2), (0,3), (0,6), (0,8) along edges.  \n\n**Safety of moves:**  \nLEFT (0,0) \u2013 safe now, but next turn will have only 1 safe move unless I go UP to (0,1).  \nRIGHT (2,0) \u2013 safe now, next turn: can go RIGHT to (3,0) for apple, or UP if body clears (unlikely since body at (2,1)).  \n\nActually body will move forward when I move, so after I move to (2,0), body becomes [(1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)], so UP(2,1) is still body next turn, so only RIGHT(3,0) is safe.  \n\nSimilarly, after LEFT to (0,0), body = [(1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,1)], so next turn UP(0,1) is empty, RIGHT(1,0) is body (dead), DOWN invalid \u2192 so only 1 safe next move (UP).  \n\nBoth are risky, but (0,0) gets apple and length 8 advantage.  \n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nIf LEFT now: next turn must go UP to (0,1). Then from (0,1), body behind at (1,0) and (1,1), so possible moves: UP(0,2) apple, RIGHT(1,1) body(dead), LEFT invalid, DOWN(0,0) body. So again only one move (UP). This forces me along the left wall upward, collecting (0,2), (0,3), etc. Risky if enemy cuts off escape.  \n\nIf RIGHT now: next turn must go RIGHT to (3,0) apple, then body becomes [(2,0),(1,0),(1,1),...] so from (3,0), next moves: UP(3,1) body(dead?), check: after move to (3,0), body = (2,0),(1,0),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,2), so (3,1) is empty! So actually UP(3,1) is safe next turn. That's better \u2014 more options.  \n\nRIGHT seems to offer more future flexibility after one forced move.

But need to re-check then because body segments will shift.\n\nActually, correction: After I move UP to (0, 2) and eat the apple, my body grows by 1 segment. My new body will be: Head (0, 2), then previous head (0, 1), then (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2).  \nSo (1, 2) will indeed be empty next turn.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nTrapped on left edge for now.

Favor RIGHT over UP now to initiate rightward pivot for chain at (8,7), maintaining upper position advantage and avoiding enemy-rising west column while building lead potential via quicker apple access (2-3 turns vs. potential west traps).\n\n**Short plan:** Eat (5,8) on turn 16-17 via eastward moves; pivot further right toward (5,7), (8,7), (8,8) chain; monitor enemy for horizontal pushes toward right apples (e.g., (8,5), (7,0)) and adjust if they threaten upper routes or if west apples become blockable; use upper open space to outmaneuver.\n\nRIGHT",

UP is into own body (backwards) or off-board down? No, into (3,8) own body. Cannot go LEFT or DOWN immediately after if it traps; going LEFT to (2,7) leaves only DOWN next to (2,6) apple but then traps me, as feasible follow-ups hit own body or head-on risk. DOWN to (3,6) allows LEFT next to (2,6) apple but similar trapping potential after eating. RIGHT to (4,7) keeps three follow-ups (DOWN, RIGHT, UP), positions for RIGHT to (5,7) apple chain, and avoids boxing myself; enemy likely won't collide here. Favor RIGHT for safety, apple access, and open space.\n\nNext plan: Eat (5,7) via RIGHT, then aim UP to (5,8), followed by RIGHT/DOWN toward (8,7)/(8,8) chain if clear; watch enemy for vertical/upward moves that could crowd y-axis or block y=6-8.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Let me assess the current state.\n\n**Current board and my snake:**\n- My head (ID 0) is at (1, 3).\n- My body: [(0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)] \u2192 9 segments + head = length 10.\n- Apples: many around, visible in list and board.\n\n**Possible moves from (1, 3):**\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (1, 4): empty on board.\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (1, 2): my body at (1, 2)? Wait, check: body list shows (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), etc. No (1,2) visibly. Let\u2019s check map: At coordinates row 2 col 1: yes (2,1) is T for my tail. So (1,2) is empty. Actually, map shows row 2 col 1 = \"T\", but that\u2019s (2,1). Let's carefully parse coordinates map given:\n\nLooking at \"row 2\" \u2014 looking at the board\u2019s text representation:  \nRow labeled 2: \"2 T . T T . . A . . .\"  \nSo x=0: T (my tail segment at (0,2)), x=1: . (empty), x=2: T, x=3: T, etc.\n\nSo (1,2) is empty. So DOWN is safe.\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (0, 3): That\u2019s my body (first segment behind head = (0,3)). Suicide \u2192 invalid.\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 3): Empty per map (row 3: \"T 0 . . . . . . . .\" \u2014 head at 3,y=3 but col 1 is 0, so col 2 is '.'). Wait carefully map row 3:\nLabel 3: \"3 T 0 . . . . . . . .\"\nSo x=0: T, x=1: 0 (my head), x=2: . (empty). Actually my head is at (1,3) so row 3 col 1 = '0', means x=1, y=3. Yes. So RIGHT is (2,3) which is empty.\n\nSo safe moves: UP (1,4), DOWN (1,2), RIGHT (2,3).\n\n**Enemy snake (#1):**\n- Head (3, 7). Possible moves from (3,7):  \nUP (3,8) \u2014 body at (3,8) (second segment) \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN (3,6) \u2014 empty on board.  \nLEFT (2,7) \u2014 empty on board.  \nRIGHT (4,7) \u2014 empty.  \nSo enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Enemy far from me (Manhattan distance 6).\n\n**Risk of head-on collision:** minimal since enemy\u2019s possible squares wouldn\u2019t intersect my possible moves except in distant future.\n\n**Apples reachable:**\n- (2,6) apple near if I go RIGHT then UP possibly.\n- (6,1) far but potential long path.\n- (0,6) apple far away up left.\n- Immediate: (6,2) (6,1) (6,6) not immediately reachable but planning path.\n\n**Long-term plan notes:**  \nMy body blocks left side heavily; moving RIGHT opens center options. Going DOWN (1,2) may lead to bottom apples but risks dead-end there because body occupies many bottom-left cells. UP feels better to keep space. But moving RIGHT (2,3) opens possibility to get apple (5,4) or (2,6) with more flexibility.\n\nI think RIGHT is strategic to get away from the crowded left wall.\n\n**Next turn plan:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (2,3), I can go UP to (2,4) towards center apples or DOWN to (2,2) but (2,2) is body so only UP, RIGHT, or possibly LEFT? Wait LEFT would be (1,3) which is now empty? Actually after move RIGHT, tail will move? Growth? No apple at (2,3), so no growth, so tail moves up one: body becomes [(1,3), (0,3), ..., last segment removed]. So (2,2) still body? Let\u2019s check: body segments shift: head to (2,3), then segment1 at (1,3), segment2 at (0,3), segment3 at (0,2), ... segment9 at (3,2) gets removed if no growth. So (2,2) will be empty? Yes because segment (2,2) becomes (2,1)? Wait current body: (0,3),(0,2),(0,1),(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,2). After moving head to (2,3) without apple, tail (3,2) removed, so new body: [(1,3),(0,3),(0,2),(0,1),(0,0),(1,0),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2)]. So (2,2) is still in body (last segment now). So DOWN from (2,3) next turn is into (2,2) \u2192 suicide. So next turn from (2,3) safe moves: UP (2,4), RIGHT (3,3), LEFT (1,3) body? (1,3) is second segment now, so yes suicide. So only UP and RIGHT safe next turn.\n\nSo moving RIGHT now slightly reduces future options next turn to only 2 directions. Still manageable if I go UP afterwards.\n\nGiven that, maybe UP now is better: from (1,3) to (1,4) safe, then next turn I have UP (1,5), RIGHT (2,4), LEFT (0,4) all likely safe. More options.\n\nBut UP misses chance to go toward center apples. But apple (2,6) is closer if I go RIGHT now \u2192 then UP over turns.\n\nSince I\u2019m leading 9 to 7, playing safe and keeping options open is key. UP seems to keep more options next turn.\n\n**Decision:** UP for more mobility.\n\nUP",

Snake #1 is far. Safe.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3,3): Board shows empty (`.`). Snake #1 not near. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2,4): Contains my own body segment (just behind head). Suicide. **Not allowed**.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,4): Board shows empty (`.`). Safe.\n\nSo possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Apples nearby:**  \n\nVisible apples close to (3,4):  \n- (5,4) is 2 steps away (RIGHT\u2192RIGHT).  \n- (6,2), (6,1), (6,6) are farther.  \n- (2,6) is north-west.  \n\nRIGHT goes toward the closest apple at (5,4).\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Enemy snake #1:**  \n\nSnake #1 head at (5, 8), body length 10 (9 apples + 1 head). Their moves from (5,8):  \nPossible destinations: (5,9) \u2013 Empty; (5,7) \u2013 Body; (4,8) \u2013 Empty (actually board shows empty but body at (4,7) not at (4,8)); (6,8) \u2013 Empty.  \nChecking: their UP (5,9) is safe for them; LEFT (4,8) is safe; RIGHT (6,8) is safe.  \n\nFrom my options:  \n- If I go RIGHT to (4,4): Manh. distance to their possible head positions next turn is:  \n  To (5,9): 6  \n  To (4,8): 4  \n  To (6,8): 4 \u2014 Not adjacent so no immediate collision risk this turn (current turn: they are moving simultaneously).  \n\nNo direct head-to-head possible this turn because their head starts at (5,8), mine at (3,4), no overlap in possible moves.  \n\nBut could we collide next turn? Possibly if we both move toward each other aggressively next turn, but not right now.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility:**\n\nGoing RIGHT to (4,4) opens paths in all directions except possibly blocked by my own body if I keep going certain ways\u2014my body is wrapping left side. That\u2019s fine; gives access to center.\n\nUP to (3,5) also fine but not progressing much toward nearest apple (5,4).  \nDOWN to (3,3) not helpful \u2014 away from most apples.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term thought:**\n\nSnake #1 length same as mine (9 apples). Race to 50 apples.  \nGoal: Maximize apple consumption while avoiding risks.  \nRight now: (5,4) is easy to grab in two moves if nothing changes. After that, central area has apples at (6,6), (8,4), etc.  \n\nHowever, (5,4) is also close to Snake #1\u2019s territory (they are at (5,8)) \u2014 they might also aim for (5,4) later.\n\nGiven they are at (5,8), they could go (5,7) next turn? Actually (5,7) is their own body, so they can\u2019t. They could go (4,8) or (6,8) or (5,9). Their shortest path to (5,4) is down, but would take at least 4 turns because of their body blockage. So apple at (5,4) is mine if I go RIGHT now.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for future turns:**  \nFrom (4,4), if Snake #1 doesn\u2019t interfere, get (5,4). Then move toward (6,6) or (8,4), keeping options open. Watch for Snake #1\u2019s possible descent toward center.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nRIGHT is safe, moves toward closest apple, good mobility.\n\nRIGHT",

Not off board. Not in my body. Not in enemy body except possibly by movement. Check enemy head danger: Enemy head at (6,9) cannot reach (5,5) in one move (only moves to (6,8), (5,9), (7,9), (6,10 invalid)). Safe from enemy head collision.  \n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (5, 3): Empty space. Safe from my body and enemy current body. Enemy head move options from (6,9): cannot reach (5,3) in one move. Safe.  \n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (4, 4): My body segment (4,4) (segment right behind head). Suicide \u2014 not allowed.  \n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 4): Empty space. Check enemy: enemy can move to (6,8), (5,9), (7,9), (6,10 invalid). Not (6,4), so safe from head collision.  \n\nSo all except LEFT are safe this turn.  \n\n---\n\n### Apple gathering opportunities:  \n\nApples visible: 10x10 board coordinates listed. Closest apples to my head:  \n- (6,6) \u2013 2 moves away (RIGHT then UP).  \n- (8,5) \u2013 longer path.  \n- But no apple at (5,5), (5,3), (6,4) currently.  \n\n---\n\n### Future safety after each move:  \n\n**UP (5,5):**  \nNext turn, body will include (5,4), (4,4), \u2026 so movement constraints:  \nFrom (5,5): Possible moves: UP (5,6) \u2013 empty; DOWN (5,4) \u2013 my body next turn, so no; LEFT (4,5) \u2013 empty; RIGHT (6,5) \u2013 empty. So 3 possible moves next turn.  \n\n**DOWN (5,3):**  \nFrom (5,3): UP (5,4) \u2013 body next turn, no; LEFT (4,3) \u2013 empty; RIGHT (6,3) \u2013 empty; DOWN (5,2) \u2013 empty. Again 3 possible next moves.  \n\n**RIGHT (6,4):**  \nFrom (6,4): UP (6,5) \u2013 empty; DOWN (6,3) \u2013 empty; LEFT (5,4) \u2013 body next turn, no; RIGHT (7,4) \u2013 empty. Also 3 moves.  \n\nSo all have equal future flexibility by immediate count, but placement matters.  \n\n---\n\n### Strategic considerations:  \n\nSnake #1 has head at (6,9). Likely going for apple at (6,6) eventually?  \nFrom (6,9): possible moves: DOWN to (6,8) (body, not allowed), LEFT to (5,9) (empty, no apple), UP off board (dead), RIGHT (7,9) (empty no apple). Actually UP not valid: (6,10) outside board \u2192 dead. So enemy must go LEFT (5,9) or RIGHT (7,9). Each keeps them far from me.  \n\nThey are walled by board top and body segments. They won\u2019t threaten me for this move.  \n\nMy best path toward apples: closest is (6,6). To reach (6,6): from (5,4) either RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.  \n\nBut apple at (6,6): Enemy may go (5,9)\u2192(5,8) body blocked? Wait, check enemy body: (5,8) is body segment, so from (6,9) LEFT to (5,9), then next turn from (5,9) can go DOWN to (5,8)? That's body, so no. They'd go LEFT then LEFT/WAY around or RIGHT. So they aren't close to (6,6) for 2 moves.  \n\nI can go RIGHT to (6,4) then UP to (6,5) then (6,6), seems safe.  \n\nAlternatively UP to (5,5) then RIGHT to (6,5) then (6,6).  \n\n---\n\n**Observation:** If I go RIGHT now, I get closer to right-side apples (8,5),(8,4),(8,7),(8,8) later. If I go UP, I stay in less dense apple zone.  \n\nAlso, to avoid boxing self later: My tail is at (1,0) and will move along path in future as I move \u2014 but far from me for now.  \n\n---\n\n**Choose:** RIGHT seems best to position for both (6,6) and other apples, keeping safe distance from enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nRIGHT",

Continuing DOWN to (7,8) offers 2 options (DOWN to (7,7) or RIGHT to (8,8) for eating), but fewer immediate follow-ups and less apple access vs. LEFT.\n- Going LEFT to (5,9) eats immediately, unlocks LEFT to (4,9) (another apple) next turn, and opens other paths (e.g., DOWN to (4,8) later). This expands options toward row-9 apples like (4,9) and avoids tight spaces.\n\nStrategy update: Prioritize eating clustered high-Y apples (e.g., (5,9) now, then (4,9)). Keep options open to avoid traps; avoid RIGHT-side moves that funnel into dead ends. Enemy is distant at (5,4), no immediate collision risk, but watch for them closing in.\n\nLEFT",

Apple at (7,1), (8,4), (8,5) also possible but farther.  \n\n---\n\n**Check possible moves from (6,4):**\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (6,5): Empty (`.` on board). Not off-board. My body check: next segment is (5,4), not (6,5). Enemy body: enemy segments at (6,9), (6,8), etc. \u2014 no collision. Enemy head at (5,9) after moving: where can enemy go?  \n   Enemy from (5,9): possible moves \u2014 UP (5,10) invalid, DOWN (5,8) is enemy body segment (no), LEFT (4,9) empty, RIGHT (6,9) enemy body segment (no). So enemy can only go to (4,9).  \n   Risk of head collision? Enemy won't reach (6,5) in one move. So UP safe.\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (6,3): Empty space. My body safe. Enemy from (5,9) going to (4,9) only \u2014 distant, safe.\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (5,4): My own body segment behind head \u2014 suicide, not allowed.\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,4): Empty space. My body safe. Enemy can't reach in one move \u2014 safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Future flexibility and apple targeting:**  \nI want apple at (6,6). Best is UP now, then UP again to (6,6) next turn if still possible.  \nFrom (6,5): next turn moves: UP (6,6) \u2014 apple there but check enemy movement: could enemy be in (6,6) in two moves? Enemy at (5,9) \u2192 (4,9) \u2192 needs (4,8)\u2192\u2026 no, far away.

They'll still be far from me this turn and next. Minimal risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**  \nEat apple (6,6) then possibly move to (7,6) or toward (8,5)/(8,4) cluster.

Also counts as moving backwards into the directly adjacent cell.\n\nValid moves are DOWN and LEFT. Both are safe and avoid immediate collisions.\n\nEvaluating among valid moves:\n- LEFT to (3,9): Keeps me at the top row (y=9), which limits future mobility. I'd only have left as a safe direction (down to (3,8) hits own body; up off board; right would be backwards to (4,9), which the rules prohibit even if not into body). This traps me in a dead-end corridor with no nearby apples and few options, reducing long-term flexibility. Apples at y=8-9 (e.g., (8,8), (9,8)) are moderately closer, but pathing to them would be inefficient from here.\n- DOWN to (4,8): Moves me closer to the high-Y apple cluster at y=8 ((0,8), (8,8), (9,8)). This opens more directions next turn: left to open space toward (0,8), right toward (8,8)/(9,8), or back up to (4,9) since it will empty out. My body occupies spots like (5,8) and (4,7) below, but this move avoids them and keeps multiple safe follow-ups. It advances toward my targets without closing options prematurely, while the enemy snake alrededor y=4 seems focused lower, so no imminent collision risk from this.\n\nDOWN is preferable for immediate apple access and flexibility, aligning with the last rationale's focus on high-Y apples.\n\n**FUTURE SELF STRATEGY NOTE**: Chose DOWN to reposition at (4,8) near y=8 apples like (8,8), (9,8), and (0,8). Prioritize paths to these (e.g., if possible, go right to x=8 area, then question to balance efficiency and safety). Watch enemy snake #0 for upward movements from (7,4)\u2014if it heads toward y=5+ rows, shift left to x=4-0 area to avoid conflicts. Keep evaluating for traps; consider growing toward apples at (8,7) or (6,6) once cleared. Aim for 12 more apples, but play defensively.\n\nDOWN",

When I move this turn, tail also moves forward because I haven\u2019t eaten an apple last turn (last turn I ate apple at (8,4) \u2014 wait check earlier game state: last move from (7,4) to (8,4) ate apple, so I grew. That apple at (8,4) is gone \u2014 wait apples list shows (8,5) still there, not (8,4). So last turn I moved RIGHT from (7,4) to (8,4). But (8,4) was not in apple list in last turn\u2019s state? Let\u2019s check.  \n\nIn last turn\u2019s state (turn 25), my head was at (7,4). Apples list then had (8,4) probably \u2014 yes, last rationale said (8,4) apple. Seems I ate it last turn, so in current state apples list is updated: current apples list has (8,5), etc., no (8,4), so yes it\u2019s gone. That means between turn 25 and turn 26 I grew by 1, so tail did not move last turn \u2014 body lengthened by 1. This turn, when I move normally, my tail moves from (0,1) to (something) along the path? Wait but actually looking at body:  \n\nCurrent body:  \n[(7,4), (6,4), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1)] \u2192 that\u2019s 11 segments after head excluding head? Wait length is 11 segments body + 1 head = total length growth? That means I must have had 11 apples before last turn\u2019s growth. No \u2014 apples collected: before last turn\u2019s move: apples 10? Let\u2019s check earlier: Scores: Snake 0 apples: 11 now; last turn\u2019s log said apples 11 already \u2014 conflicting? Maybe earlier turn info said apples 11 at start of last turn too \u2014 score so far: Your snake apples: 11. Enemy apples: 11. So I already had 11 apples last turn, so eating apple last turn would make it 12??? Wait discrepancy: This turn apples: 11 scores so far. Last turn apples: 11 for me. So I did NOT eat apple last turn? That means my move last turn: from (7,4) to (8,4) \u2014 board then showed (8,4) supposed apple but maybe enemy got it? No, enemy far away.  \n\nActually, no \u2014 I realize mistake: Look at board state now: Position (8,4) has my head \u201c0\u201d, so apple not there anymore. But score: still 11 apples for me listed in scores. So did apple count fail to update here or did I miscount? Let\u2019s proceed with safety regardless.\n\n**Safety check from (8,4)**:  \nBody segment behind head = (7,4)  \n\n1. **UP** (8,5): Apple there (from list). Check if safe:  \nBoard shows . at (8,5)? Actually board top rows:  \nRow 8: positions: 8,9 are A A. So (8,5) not shown but list says apple at (8,5). Map row 8 labeling: row 8: `A T T T 1 T T . A A` \u2192 columns 0-9: col 0: A, col1: T, col2: T, col3: T, col4: 1, col5: T, col6: T, col7: ., col8: A, col9: A. So (8,5) is enemy body (T). Can\u2019t go there \u2014 collision enemy body! So UP not safe. (Check: x=8,y=5 \u2192 col5 row8 = T).  \n\n2. **DOWN** (8,3): Check row 3: \u201cT T . . . . . . . A\u201d col8 = . \u2192 safe.  \n\n3. **LEFT** (7,4): row4: col7 = T (my body) \u2192 unsafe unless tail moves. Last segment tail at (0,1). The segment (7,4) will remain because body length didn\u2019t change (no apple last turn). Actually verify: Body[0] = (7,4) is neck. Moving leaves tail at (0,1) but (7,4) remains part of body because total length same. So LEFT unsafe.  \n\n4. **RIGHT** (9,4): row4 col9 = \".\" \u2014 empty. Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.  \n\n**Enemy snake #1** at (4,8) going to? Possibly UP off board, DOWN (4,7) its body, LEFT (3,8) its body? Wait check: body: [(4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (6,8), (5,8), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8)]. So:  \n(4,7) its body, (3,8) its body. So enemy can only go to (4,9) no\u2014body there too? Its body segments: head (4,8), behind it (4,9) \u2014 so UP is its own body. So enemy possible moves: UP invalid, DOWN invalid (body), LEFT invalid(body), RIGHT invalid(body)? Wait, perhaps I misread order: body after head: first body segment = (4,9). So neck is (4,9). So moving back is impossible for enemy too. Then enemy\u2019s valid moves: from (4,8) not including neck (4,9) but other adjacent cells:  \n(3,8) = body, (5,8) = body, (4,7) = body. So enemy has zero safe moves! That means Snake #1 dies this turn no matter what \u2014 game may end next turn with me as only survivor unless it has secret move?  \n\nCheck: board at (4,7) is T, (3,8) T, (5,8) T, (4,9) T \u2014 so no escape. So enemy dies this turn.\n\nSo I just need to survive this turn \u2014 then I win. So any safe move wins.  \n\nBetween DOWN (8,3) and RIGHT (9,4): future flexibility:  \nNext turn after this, opponents dead, but apples still might matter for final score for tiebreak? We both have 11 apples now. Collecting more apples boosts score for possible future games or tiebreak? No current opponent threat, so choose apple path. Nearest apple from each:   \nFrom (8,3): apple at (9,3) is one step RIGHT next turn. Also (7,0) far.  \nFrom (9,4): apple at (9,3) DOWN next turn, also (9,8) far.  \nBoth equally near apple next turn? Actually (9,4) to (9,3) DOWN or LEFT to (8,4)? But (8,4) will be empty. Apples: (9,3) is common. Same distance.  \n\nLet\u2019s pick one arbitrarily; RIGHT keeps me near top right apples cluster (8,7), (8,8), (9,8).  \n\n**Plan for next turns**: Since enemy dies this turn, head to apple-rich region top right, collect to 50 for win.\n\nRIGHT",
