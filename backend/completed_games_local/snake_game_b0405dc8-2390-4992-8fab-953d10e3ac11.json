Need to think about simultaneous moves:  \nIf enemy moves DOWN from (9, 8) \u2192 (9, 7), not relevant to my possible cells.  \nIf enemy moves LEFT from (9, 8) \u2192 (8, 8), not relevant.  \nIf enemy moves UP from (9, 8) \u2192 (9, 9), irrelevant.  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT \u2192 off board (10, 8) \u2192 enemy would die, so unlikely unless enemy suicides.  \n\nAlso check head-on collision:  \nIf enemy moves SW (LEFT + DOWN) to (8, 7)? No, they move only one direction.  \nSo enemy can\u2019t reach any of my possible next head positions in one move from (9, 8).  \n\nThus all 4 directions are **immediately safe** from enemy body/head collision this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Consider apples and future safety**  \nApples nearby:  \n- (3, 1): 2 right, 1 down from me \u2192 not adjacent, but DOWN then RIGHT might get it soon.  \n- (1, 4): directly above me at (1, 4), distance 2 up.  \n- (0, 0): far.  \n- (4, 7): far.  \n- (7, 4): far.\n\nClosest apple: (1, 4) requires UP twice. (3, 1) requires RIGHT twice and DOWN once.\n\nFrom (1, 2):  \nUP to (1, 3) \u2192 then next turn could go UP to apple (1, 4).  \nRIGHT to (2, 2) \u2192 then could go DOWN to (2, 1) then RIGHT to (3, 1).  \n\nBut also need to think about **future safe moves** after moving.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Future move options after each move**  \nFrom (1, 3): possible moves next turn: UP (to apple at (1, 4)), DOWN (back to (1, 2)), LEFT (0, 3), RIGHT (2, 3). All likely safe next turn unless enemy moves there.\n\nFrom (1, 1): moves next turn: UP (back to (1, 2)), DOWN (1, 0), LEFT (0, 1), RIGHT (2, 1). Also all likely safe.\n\nFrom (0, 2): moves next turn: UP (0, 3), DOWN (0, 1), RIGHT (1, 2) only, LEFT off board \u2192 so only 3 safe moves, one is going back.\n\nFrom (2, 2): moves next turn: UP (2, 3), DOWN (2, 1), LEFT (1, 2), RIGHT (3, 2) \u2192 all 4 safe.\n\nSo moving RIGHT or UP keeps more future options (especially RIGHT keeps 4 options, UP keeps 4 options, DOWN keeps 4, LEFT reduces to 3).\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Avoid moving toward enemy unnecessarily**  \nEnemy is far away (9, 8), no immediate threat.  \n\nBut think about apple strategy: if I go UP toward (1, 4), next turn I eat it and grow to length 2, which makes moving back down to (1, 3) impossible (would hit my new body at (1, 3)? Wait, careful: if I eat apple at (1, 4), my head moves there, my tail stays at (1, 3)?? No: when length 1 snake eats apple, new length becomes 2: head at apple cell, tail at original head position? Actually, in Snake when you eat apple, you grow by 1 segment **at the next move**? Let's recall: In this game, if you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment immediately (so after eating, your head is on apple, your body now includes previous head position behind it). So if I\u2019m at (1, 2) now, move UP to (1, 3) (no apple), move UP again to (1, 4) (apple), after that move my body will be: head at (1, 4), body segment at (1, 3). Length 2.  \n\nSo going UP now to (1, 3) sets me to eat apple next turn if possible.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Compare UP vs RIGHT**  \nUP: toward nearest apple (1, 4), future options remain good.  \nRIGHT: toward other apple (3, 1) but farther, also opens central board.\n\nGiven early game, securing an apple quickly could be good. Also enemy far away.\n\n---\n\n**Step 8: Choose**  \nI\u2019ll go **UP** toward nearest apple while keeping options open.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf apple still at (1, 4), move UP to eat it. If not, consider moving toward another apple while avoiding dead ends. Keep an eye on enemy movement from far corner.\n\n---\n\nUP",

If I move UP, I eat it this turn, grow to length 2, and my body will be [(1, 4), (1, 3)] next turn.  \n\nOther apples are farther:  \n- (3, 1): 2 right, 2 down.  \n- (7, 4): far right.  \n- (4, 7): far up-right.  \n- (0, 0): far down-left.  \n\nEating an apple early is good for score and growth, but must consider future safety after growing.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Future options after each move**  \n\nIf UP to (1, 4): eat apple \u2192 length 2, body at (1, 3). Next turn, from (1, 4): possible moves:  \n- UP to (1, 5) \u2013 safe unless enemy moves there.  \n- DOWN to (1, 3) \u2013 blocked by own body \u2192 **invalid move** (suicide).  \n- LEFT to (0, 4) \u2013 safe if empty.  \n- RIGHT to (2, 4) \u2013 safe if empty.  \nSo DOWN is blocked, leaving 3 possible moves next turn.  \n\nIf DOWN to (1, 2): no apple, length 1 still. Next turn from (1, 2): all 4 directions open (no body yet).  \n\nIf LEFT to (0, 3): no apple, length 1. Next turn from (0, 3): UP (0, 4), DOWN (0, 2), RIGHT (1, 3), LEFT off board \u2192 3 moves.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (2, 3): no apple, length 1. Next turn from (2, 3): all 4 moves open.  \n\nSo DOWN or RIGHT keeps 4 options next turn; UP reduces to 3 (but eats apple); LEFT reduces to 3 (no apple).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Enemy position and long-term**  \nEnemy is far (8, 8), not an immediate threat. Eating apple early gives a length advantage but slightly reduces mobility temporarily. However, length 2 still has plenty of space on a 10\u00d710 board.  \n\nIf I eat apple now, I\u2019ll be at (1, 4) with body at (1, 3). Next turn I can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT \u2014 still fine.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Decision**  \nEating the apple at (1, 4) is safe and gets first score. The risk of reduced mobility is minimal because board is still open.  \n\nGoing DOWN or RIGHT avoids apple but keeps flexibility \u2014 but delaying apple eating lets enemy possibly get closer to other apples, and I want to lead in score early.  \n\nI choose **UP** to eat apple now.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (1, 4), avoid moving DOWN into own body at (1, 3). Choose among UP, LEFT, RIGHT depending on apple positions and enemy movement. Target nearby apples like (3, 1) or (7, 4) afterward.  \n\nUP",

UP or RIGHT keep 3 moves.\n\n**Step 6: Enemy movement prediction**  \nEnemy at (8, 7) might go for apple at (7, 7) (LEFT) or (4, 7) (far LEFT) or (7, 4) (DOWN). Not an immediate threat to me.\n\n**Step 7: Long-term plan**  \nI want to stay flexible and move toward nearest apple cluster while avoiding dead ends.  \nGoing RIGHT (2, 4) moves me toward (3, 1) (down-right later) and also toward center.  \nGoing UP (1, 5) moves toward (4, 7) but is less direct.  \nSince LEFT reduces options too much, avoid it.\n\nRIGHT seems best: keeps options open and progresses toward (3, 1) or center.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (2, 4), body will be [(2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 3)]. Next turn from (2, 4): avoid LEFT into own body, consider UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Target apple at (3, 1) by going DOWN next turns.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, correction: my current body is head (2, 3), then (2, 4). Moving DOWN to (2, 2) makes new head (2, 2), body = [(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)]?

No overlap with enemy\u2019s possible targets (6,9), (6,7), (7,8) \u2192 no head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nFrom (1,2): closest apple (0,5) distance 4, (0,0) distance 3.  \nFrom (1,0): closest apple (0,0) distance 1 (directly adjacent!).  \nFrom (0,1): closest apple (0,0) distance 1 (down-left diagonal, but can\u2019t eat this turn), (0,5) distance 4.  \nDOWN or LEFT would get equally close to (0,0), but DOWN to (1,0) is *adjacent* to (0,0) \u2014 next turn can eat it by moving LEFT.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options after each move**  \n- UP to (1,2): next turn from (1,2) has 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) likely.  \n- DOWN to (1,0): next turn from (1,0) has 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT) \u2014 DOWN off board. But moving DOWN now puts apple (0,0) reachable next turn by LEFT, which is safe and grows snake, restoring mobility.  \n- LEFT to (0,1): next turn from (0,1) has 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN) \u2014 LEFT off board.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy consideration**  \nEnemy far away on top right, likely targeting (8,7) or (7,4). We can safely grab (0,0) next turn if we move DOWN now.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN to (1,0) sets up eating (0,0) next turn, giving growth and score advantage. It\u2019s safe this turn, and next turn\u2019s move (LEFT into apple) will be safe unless enemy moves there, which is unlikely given their position. This also avoids trapping myself in a corner prematurely.  \n\n**Short plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving DOWN to (1,0), head at (1,0), body [(1,1), (2,1)]. Next turn, move LEFT to (0,0) to eat apple and grow. Ensure no enemy head moves into (0,0) \u2014 very unlikely. Then from (0,0) after eating, only UP and RIGHT will be valid (DOWN and LEFT off board), but growth gives extra segment, so not trapped yet. Consider moving toward (0,5) afterward.  \n\nDOWN",

Enemy head is at (8,6), far away, no head-on collision possible this turn. Safe.  \nRIGHT (1,2): within board, empty, enemy far. Safe.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity and growth**  \nUP: moves toward apple (0,5) vertically along left wall.  \nRIGHT: moves toward apple (2,6) and (1,8) indirectly, opens more board space.  \nNeither collects an apple this turn.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options analysis**  \nFrom (0,3): possible moves next turn: UP to (0,4), DOWN to (0,2) (occupied by my body after move), LEFT off board, RIGHT to (1,3) (likely free). So only UP and RIGHT would be available, similar to now but higher up.  \nFrom (1,2): possible moves next turn: UP to (1,3), DOWN to (1,1) (currently free), LEFT to (0,2) (occupied by my body after move), RIGHT to (2,2) (free).

No immediate threat.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI want to avoid being trapped along left edge. Moving RIGHT now gives more freedom next turn and starts moving toward central apples (2,6) or (1,8). Apple (0,5) is straight up, but going up along left wall reduces future options quickly.  \nPlan: move RIGHT to (1,2) now. Next turn, evaluate moving UP toward (1,8) or RIGHT toward (2,6) depending on enemy position.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe. RIGHT gives more future mobility and starts path toward apples while avoiding left-edge trap. Choose RIGHT.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (1,2), next turn I\u2019ll have UP, DOWN, RIGHT available. Prefer UP toward apple (1,8) if safe, otherwise RIGHT toward (2,6). Keep enemy\u2019s possible moves in mind \u2014 it could move toward center apples too.\n\nRIGHT",

Between UP and RIGHT, RIGHT moves toward central apples (2,6) and (7,4) while keeping distance from enemy currently at (5,6).  \n\nI choose **RIGHT** because:  \n- It keeps 3 next-move options.  \n- It progresses toward apple (2,6) (distance 3 from (2,4)).  \n- It avoids left-edge trap.  \n- Enemy is not an immediate threat on that path.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (2,4), next turn consider safety toward (2,5), (2,3), or (3,4). If enemy moves toward (2,6), be cautious of head-on collision possibility in 2\u20133 turns. Prefer to circle toward (7,4) if enemy is near (2,6). Keep options open.  \n\nRIGHT",

Enemy head at (4,6), Manhattan distance 3, safe.  \nDOWN (2,3): within board, empty. Safe.  \nRIGHT (3,4): within board, empty. Safe.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nUP: toward apple (2,6) directly above (distance 1 from (2,5)). Also toward (1,8).  \nDOWN: away from most apples except maybe (9,1) far away.  \nRIGHT: toward apple (7,4) (distance 4 from (3,4)), also central area.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options**  \nFrom (2,5): next moves UP (2,6) (apple), DOWN (2,4) (occupied after move), LEFT (1,5), RIGHT (3,5).  \n- UP (2,6): apple, safe now.  \n- LEFT (1,5): empty.  \n- RIGHT (3,5): empty.  \nSo from (2,5), next turn would have UP, LEFT, RIGHT available (3 options).  \n\nFrom (2,3): next moves UP (2,4) (occupied), DOWN (2,2), LEFT (1,3) (occupied), RIGHT (3,3).  \n- DOWN (2,2): empty.  \n- RIGHT (3,3): empty.  \nSo from (2,3), next turn only DOWN and RIGHT available (2 options).  \n\nFrom (3,4): next moves UP (3,5), DOWN (3,3), LEFT (2,4) (occupied), RIGHT (4,4).  \n- UP (3,5): empty.  \n- DOWN (3,3): empty.  \n- RIGHT (4,4): empty.  \nSo from (3,4), next turn would have UP, DOWN, RIGHT available (3 options).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy consideration**  \nEnemy at (4,6) could move toward apple (2,6). If enemy goes LEFT to (3,6), then DOWN to (3,5) or (3,6) to (2,6), it might reach (2,6) in 2 turns. If I go UP to (2,5), I could reach (2,6) next turn before enemy if enemy doesn\u2019t move directly there this turn. But enemy might move DOWN to (4,5) or other directions. Still, moving UP puts me close to apple but also close to enemy\u2019s possible path.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Risk assessment**  \nUP (2,5): gets me next to apple (2,6) with good options, but enemy might also aim for same apple \u2014 risk of head-on collision if we both go for it next turn. However, enemy\u2019s current Manhattan distance to (2,6) is 2 (from (4,6) to (2,6)), same as mine from (2,5) to (2,6). If enemy moves LEFT to (3,6) this turn, we could both enter (2,6) next turn and die. That\u2019s risky.  \n\nDOWN (2,3): moves away from apples and reduces future options (only 2 next moves). Avoid unless necessary.  \n\nRIGHT (3,4): moves toward apple (7,4), keeps 3 options, avoids immediate confrontation with enemy over (2,6). Safer.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP is tempting for apple proximity but carries collision risk if enemy moves toward (2,6) this turn. Since we move simultaneously, I can\u2019t know enemy\u2019s move. Given enemy length 4 same as mine, tie on apples, likely they\u2019ll also go for nearest apple (2,6). Safer to avoid that gamble this turn.  \n\nRIGHT is safer, maintains flexibility, moves toward another apple.  \n\nI choose **RIGHT** because:  \n- Keeps 3 next-move options.  \n- Avoids potential head-on collision over (2,6).  \n- Progresses toward apple (7,4).  \n- Enemy at (4,6) is less likely to move toward (7,4) immediately.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (3,4), assess safety toward (3,5), (3,3), (4,4). If enemy moves toward (2,6), I\u2019ll be clear. If enemy moves toward my area later, consider circling around. Keep options open, avoid trapping myself near edges.  \n\nRIGHT",

I\u2019m length 4 vs enemy length 5, so head-on collision kills both. Enemy likely avoids (3,5) if I\u2019m at (4,5).  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Risk assessment**  \nUP (4,5): reduces future options because UP next turn blocked by enemy body at (4,6). Also moves closer to enemy head, increasing risk next turn.  \nDOWN (4,3): safe, keeps options open, but moves away from apples.  \nRIGHT (5,4): safe, keeps options open, moves toward apple (7,4), and away from enemy.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nRIGHT is best: progresses toward apple, keeps flexibility, avoids enemy.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (5,4), consider moving toward (6,4) or (5,5)/(5,3) depending on enemy position. Try to collect apple (7,4) soon while watching enemy\u2019s movement. If enemy moves toward (2,5) or (1,6), I can continue toward (7,4) safely. Avoid getting trapped in top-right corner later.  \n\nRIGHT",

Enemy head at (1,9) \u2192 Manhattan distance |8-1|+|5-9|=7+4=11 \u2192 safe.  \nDOWN (8,3): within board, empty. Distance to enemy: |8-1|+|3-9|=7+6=13 \u2192 safe.  \nRIGHT (9,4): within board, empty. Distance to enemy: |9-1|+|4-9|=8+5=13 \u2192 safe.  \n\nNo immediate collision with enemy body or head possible unless enemy moves into my cell simultaneously, but enemy is far away.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples:  \n1. (9,1): distance from (8,4) = |9-8|+|1-4| = 1+3 = 4  \n2. (0,5): distance = 8+1=9  \n3. (9,2): distance = 1+2=3  \n4. (0,4): distance = 8+0=8  \n5. (2,3): distance = 6+1=7  \n\nClosest apple is (9,2) at distance 3.  \nTo reach (9,2): from (8,4) \u2192 need to go RIGHT (9,4) then DOWN twice (9,3)\u2192(9,2), or RIGHT then DOWN then DOWN.  \nAlso (9,1) is close after that.  \n\nRIGHT moves closer to (9,2) and (9,1).  \nUP moves away from those apples but toward (0,5) and (0,4), which are far.  \nDOWN moves toward (2,3) slightly but also toward bottom edge.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options after each move**  \nUP (8,5): next turn options: UP (8,6), LEFT (7,5), RIGHT (9,5) \u2014 all empty \u2192 3 options.  \nDOWN (8,3): next turn options: DOWN (8,2), LEFT (7,3), RIGHT (9,3) \u2014 all empty \u2192 3 options.  \nRIGHT (9,4): next turn options: UP (9,5), DOWN (9,3), LEFT (8,4) \u2014 but (8,4) will be my body next turn (tail still at (4,4), body shifts forward), so LEFT invalid then. So only UP and DOWN safe \u2192 2 options.  \n\nSo RIGHT reduces future safe moves to 2, while UP and DOWN keep 3.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy consideration**  \nEnemy at (1,9) likely heading for (0,5) or (0,4) \u2014 far from me. No immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Risk vs reward**  \nRIGHT gets me closer to two apples (9,2) and (9,1) but puts me on edge with fewer next-move options.  \nUP or DOWN keep more flexibility but delay apple collection.  \n\nGiven my apple count is 4 vs enemy\u2019s 6, I need to catch up. The right-side apples are reachable in 2\u20133 moves safely if I plan.  \n\nBut if I go RIGHT to (9,4), next turn I\u2019ll have only UP/DOWN as options, which could be risky if enemy approaches later. However, enemy is far away for now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nI think short-term apple grab is worth it, but maybe I should go DOWN first to position better for (9,2)?  \nFrom (8,3): next turn go RIGHT to (9,3), then DOWN to (9,2) gets apple.  \nFrom (8,4) DOWN to (8,3) \u2192 keeps more options open than going RIGHT now.  \n\nActually, let\u2019s check:  \nIf I go DOWN now to (8,3), apples (9,2) distance = |9-8|+|2-3|=1+1=2 \u2192 very close next turn.  \nAlso (9,1) distance = 1+2=3.  \n\nSo DOWN positions me equally well for those apples while keeping 3 options next turn, whereas RIGHT reduces options immediately.  \n\nSo DOWN seems better.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving DOWN to (8,3), next turn go RIGHT to (9,3) to approach (9,2), but check safety. Keep monitoring enemy movement.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Actually (8,2) \u2192 (9,1) is distance 2 (RIGHT then DOWN), same as from (9,3) to (9,2). But from (8,2) I could also go RIGHT to (9,2) directly next turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options after each move**  \nDOWN to (8,2): next turn options: UP (8,3) \u2014 will be occupied by my tail if I eat an apple? Let's see: if I don't eat an apple this turn, my tail stays at (5,4), so (8,3) will be empty next turn (body shifts: head to (8,2), rest to (8,3),(8,4),(7,4),(6,4)). So from (8,2): UP(8,3) free, LEFT(7,2) free, RIGHT(9,2) free (apple). \u2192 3 options.  \n\nLEFT to (7,3): next turn options: UP(7,4) \u2014 occupied by my body (segment at (7,4) shifts to (6,4) maybe? Let's check: body will be [(7,3),(8,3),(8,4),(7,4),(6,4)] so (7,4) is occupied, so UP invalid. DOWN(7,2) free, LEFT(6,3) free, RIGHT(8,3) free. So 3 options still.  \n\nRIGHT to (9,3): next turn options: UP(9,4) free, DOWN(9,2) apple, LEFT(8,3) occupied by my body (segment at (8,3) shifts to (8,4)? Let's check: body will be [(9,3),(8,3),(8,4),(7,4),(6,4)], so (8,3) is occupied, so LEFT invalid. So only UP and DOWN safe \u2192 2 options.  \n\nSo RIGHT again reduces future safe moves to 2, while LEFT and DOWN keep 3.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy consideration**  \nEnemy at (0,9) likely heading for (0,5) or (0,4) \u2014 far from me. No immediate threat.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Risk vs reward**  \nRIGHT gets me to (9,3) and next turn DOWN to (9,2) for apple, but puts me on edge with fewer options.  \nDOWN to (8,2) also lets me go RIGHT to (9,2) next turn for apple, while keeping more options now.  \n\nSo DOWN seems better than RIGHT for flexibility.  \n\nLEFT moves away from apples, so less desirable.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nI\u2019ll go DOWN to (8,2) to keep options open and still be 1 move away from apple (9,2) next turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,2), consider RIGHT to (9,2) to eat apple if safe, otherwise UP or LEFT to avoid dead ends.

Also (9, 1) at distance 2 from (8, 2).  \n(2, 3) is far, others are at far left side.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options after each move**  \n\n- **RIGHT (9, 2)** \u2192 eat apple, length grows to 6, body becomes [(9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4)], tail stays at (6, 4). Next turn from (9, 2):  \n    - UP (9, 3): empty.  \n    - DOWN (9, 1): empty (apple at (9, 1)).  \n    - LEFT (8, 2): occupied by my body (second segment).  \n    - RIGHT off board \u2192 invalid.  \n    So only UP and DOWN safe \u2192 2 options.  \n\n- **DOWN (8, 1)** \u2192 no apple eaten, body shifts: [(8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4)], tail (6, 4) disappears. Next turn from (8, 1):  \n    - UP (8, 2): occupied by my body \u2192 invalid.  \n    - DOWN (8, 0): empty.  \n    - LEFT (7, 1): empty.  \n    - RIGHT (9, 1): empty (apple).  \n    So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n- **LEFT (7, 2)** \u2192 no apple eaten, body shifts: [(7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4)], tail (6, 4) disappears. Next turn from (7, 2):  \n    - UP (7, 3): empty.  \n    - DOWN (7, 1): empty.  \n    - LEFT (6, 2): empty.  \n    - RIGHT (8, 2): occupied by my body \u2192 invalid.  \n    So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk vs reward**  \nRIGHT gives immediate apple but reduces future safe moves to 2 and puts me on edge of board.  \nLEFT/DOWN keep more options next turn.  \n\nHowever, DOWN (8, 1) leaves apple (9, 2) uneaten, but I could go to (9, 1) next turn for apple.  \nLEFT moves away from both (9, 2) and (9, 1).  \n\nGiven enemy is far and not threatening, I could take apple now and accept fewer options next turn, but I should check if that\u2019s survivable.  \n\nFrom (9, 2) after eating, next turn I can go DOWN to (9, 1) for another apple, then possibly LEFT to (8, 1) to get off edge. That sequence seems okay.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Avoid crowding myself**  \nMy body occupies (8,3), (8,4), (7,4). Going LEFT to (7,2) keeps me clear of body but moves away from apples.  \nGoing DOWN to (8,1) also clear.  \n\nBut apple at (9, 2) is tempting and safe to take now.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nI\u2019ll take the apple now with RIGHT, then next turn likely go DOWN to (9, 1) for another apple if safe.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9, 2) after eating apple, choose DOWN to (9, 1) for apple if safe, else UP to (9, 3). Watch enemy movement.  \n\nRIGHT",

My path to (5, 5) is safe from them for now.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Dead ends**  \nMy body occupies right side (x=6 to 9). Moving LEFT opens central area, but moving UP also fine. UP seems direct and keeps options open.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP gives most direct route to closest apple, keeps 3 next moves available, avoids risk.  \nLEFT also safe but slightly farther from apple.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose **UP** for efficiency.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5, 2), move UP toward (5, 5) if safe.

Enemy cannot reach (5, 5) in one move \u2192 no direct head-on collision risk this turn. However, after eating apple, my length grows immediately, so next turn my tail doesn\u2019t move. That means my body occupies same cells next turn except new head position.  \n\n**LEFT (4, 4):**  \nEnemy could move RIGHT to (4, 4) from (3, 4) \u2192 head-on collision if both go there \u2192 both die.  \nSo LEFT has head-on risk.  \n\n**RIGHT (6, 4):**  \nEnemy cannot reach (6, 4) in one move \u2192 safe from head-on.\n\n---\n\n**3. Apple considerations:**  \n- (5, 5) is 1 step away (UP). Eating it grows me to length 8, enemy length 11.  \n- Enemy likely wants (4, 6) or (3, 6) \u2013 they are closer to enemy than to me.  \n- If I don\u2019t take (5, 5), enemy might get it later, but enemy currently far.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Future options after each safe move:**  \n**UP (5, 5):**  \nAfter eating apple, my body becomes: head (5, 5), then (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1).  \nFrom (5, 5), possible moves next turn: UP to (5, 6), LEFT to (4, 5), RIGHT to (6, 5), DOWN to (5, 4) \u2013 but (5, 4) will be my body then (since tail doesn\u2019t move after eating apple) \u2192 DOWN not safe next turn. So 3 safe moves initially.  \n\n**LEFT (4, 4):**  \nFrom (4, 4), next moves: UP to (4, 5), DOWN to (4, 3), LEFT to (3, 4) \u2013 currently enemy head but enemy will move, RIGHT to (5, 4) \u2013 my body next turn (since tail moves if no apple eaten). If no apple eaten, tail moves away from (8, 1) to (9, 1)? Wait, my tail is (8, 1), last segment. If I move without eating apple, tail moves to (9, 1)? Actually my body: head (5, 4), then (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1). If I move LEFT to (4, 4) and no apple eaten, new head (4, 4), rest shift: (5, 4) becomes second, (5, 3) third, etc., tail (8, 1) disappears, new tail (5, 1)? Wait, let's check: body length 7, move without apple: new head (4, 4), then old head (5, 4) becomes segment 2, (5, 3) segment 3, (5, 2) segment 4, (5, 1) segment 5, (6, 1) segment 6, (7, 1) segment 7, tail (8, 1) disappears. So (5, 4) occupied next turn. So from (4, 4), RIGHT to (5, 4) not safe next turn.  \n\n**RIGHT (6, 4):**  \nFrom (6, 4), next moves: UP to (6, 5), DOWN to (6, 3), LEFT to (5, 4) \u2013 my body next turn (since tail moves if no apple), RIGHT to (7, 4). So 3 safe moves likely.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Enemy prediction:**  \nEnemy at (3, 4). Their safe moves: UP (3, 5), DOWN (3, 3), LEFT (2, 4), RIGHT (4, 4).  \nThey likely go UP toward apples (4, 6)/(3, 6) or RIGHT toward (4, 4). If they go RIGHT to (4, 4), and I go LEFT to (4, 4), we collide. So LEFT is risky.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term:**  \nEnemy is longer (11 vs my 7). Head-on collision kills both \u2192 bad for me since they have more apples. Avoid head-on.  \nApple at (5, 5) is safe to take now. Taking it grows me, but reduces future mobility next turn (DOWN blocked). Still, I keep UP/LEFT/RIGHT options from (5, 5).  \n\nUP seems best: no head-on risk, immediate apple, moves toward board center keeping options.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nTake (5, 5) this turn. Next turn from (5, 5), consider going UP to (5, 6) or LEFT/RIGHT depending on enemy position. Avoid moving toward enemy body along left wall. Possibly aim for (4, 6) or (8, 9) later.  \n\nUP",

Possible moves from (5, 5):**  \n\n- **UP** \u2192 (5, 6) \u2013 empty, not my body, not enemy body currently.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5, 4) \u2013 my body (second segment) \u2192 **not safe**.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4, 5) \u2013 empty, not my body, not enemy body currently.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 5) \u2013 empty, not my body, not enemy body currently.  \n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**2. Immediate death check:**  \n\n**UP (5, 6):**  \nNot off board, not occupied now. Enemy head at (3, 5) could move UP to (3, 6), DOWN to (3, 4), LEFT to (2, 5), RIGHT to (4, 5).  \nEnemy cannot reach (5, 6) in one move \u2192 safe from head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**LEFT (4, 5):**  \nEnemy head at (3, 5) could move RIGHT to (4, 5) \u2192 possible head-on collision if both go there \u2192 both die. That\u2019s risky.  \n\n**RIGHT (6, 5):**  \nEnemy cannot reach (6, 5) in one move \u2192 safe from head-on.\n\n---\n\n**3. Apple considerations:**  \n\nClosest apples:  \n- (4, 6) is 2 steps away (LEFT then UP or UP then LEFT).  \n- (3, 6) is 3 steps away.  \n- (4, 8) far.  \n- (8, 9) far.  \n- (1, 1) far.  \n\nEnemy is at (3, 5), so (3, 6) and (4, 6) are very close to enemy. If I go LEFT toward them, I risk moving into enemy\u2019s path.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Future options after each safe move:**  \n\n**UP (5, 6):**  \nFrom (5, 6), next turn moves: UP (5, 7), LEFT (4, 6) \u2013 apple there but maybe contested, RIGHT (6, 6), DOWN (5, 5) \u2013 my body next turn (since tail moves if no apple eaten).  \nIf no apple eaten this turn, my tail (8, 1) disappears, new tail (5, 1), body: head (5, 6), then (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1). So (5, 5) occupied next turn \u2192 DOWN not safe.  \n\n**LEFT (4, 5):**  \nFrom (4, 5), next moves: UP (4, 6) \u2013 apple, but enemy could also be there if they go UP from (3, 5), DOWN (4, 4), LEFT (3, 5) \u2013 enemy head now but will move, RIGHT (5, 5) \u2013 my body next turn. So only UP and DOWN safe next turn if enemy moves away from (3, 5). But head-on risk this turn if enemy goes RIGHT.  \n\n**RIGHT (6, 5):**  \nFrom (6, 5), next moves: UP (6, 6), DOWN (6, 4), LEFT (5, 5) \u2013 my body next turn, RIGHT (7, 5). So UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe next turn. Good options.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Enemy prediction:**  \nEnemy safe moves from (3, 5): UP (3, 6) apple, DOWN (3, 4) body?, actually (3, 4) is their second segment \u2014 no, enemy body: (3, 4) is second segment, so DOWN is safe (not their body except tail? Wait, their body: head (3, 5), then (3, 4), (3, 3), \u2026 so DOWN to (3, 4) is their own body \u2192 not safe for them). So enemy cannot go DOWN. Their safe moves: UP (3, 6), LEFT (2, 5), RIGHT (4, 5).  \n\nEnemy likely goes UP to (3, 6) for apple, or RIGHT to (4, 5) toward (4, 6).  \n\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (4, 5) and I go LEFT to (4, 5), head-on collision \u2192 both die. So LEFT is dangerous.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Decision:**  \n\nEliminate LEFT due to head-on risk.  \nSafe: UP and RIGHT.  \n\nWhich is better?  \n\nUP (5, 6): moves toward center, away from enemy, but away from apples except (4, 6) maybe next turn.  \nRIGHT (6, 5): opens path to right side apples (8, 9) later, keeps distance from enemy, more safe next moves.  \n\nI think RIGHT is slightly safer because:  \n- Enemy likely moving UP or RIGHT, but RIGHT for them is (4, 5) \u2014 I\u2019m not going there.  \n- From (6, 5), I have 3 safe moves next turn, from (5, 6) also 3 safe moves, but (5, 6) is closer to enemy\u2019s possible UP path.  \n\nActually, both are safe this turn. But UP puts me at (5, 6), enemy could be at (3, 6) or (4, 5) next turn \u2014 not too close.  \n\nGiven enemy length 11 vs my 8 (after last apple), I want to avoid risky confrontations. RIGHT seems to open more board space.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nTake RIGHT now to (6, 5). Next turn, assess moving UP toward (8, 9) or staying right side to avoid enemy. Try to collect apples on right/top while enemy is tied up on left/top.  \n\nRIGHT",

Enemy prediction:**  \nEnemy likely wants (4, 6) apple. Could go RIGHT to (4, 6) this turn.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT, they\u2019ll be at (4, 6) next to apple.  \nIf enemy goes UP to (3, 7) or LEFT to (2, 6), they\u2019re moving away from me.  \n\nGiven enemy\u2019s long body, they might avoid head-on risk with me since I\u2019m shorter, but they\u2019re far enough that immediate collision unlikely.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term planning:**  \nI\u2019m behind in apples (7 vs 11). Need to collect safely.  \nRight side apples (8, 9) are far but reachable if I head up-right.  \nIf I go UP now, I stay central and can go toward (8, 9) or (4, 8).  \nIf I go RIGHT now, I go toward right edge, which may limit space later but has apple at (8, 9) above.  \n\nGoing DOWN reduces options next turn and moves away from most apples.  \n\nBetween UP and RIGHT:  \nUP puts me at (6, 6) \u2013 3 safe moves next turn, closer to (4, 8) and (8, 9) in future.  \nRIGHT puts me at (7, 5) \u2013 3 safe moves next turn, closer to right edge, maybe more trapped later.  \n\nUP seems better for board control and future apple access.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nGo UP now to (6, 6). Next turn, depending on enemy position, consider moving toward (8, 9) via (7, 6) or (6, 7). Avoid moving left toward enemy if they\u2019re near (4, 6).  \n\nUP",

Possible moves from (6, 6):**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (6, 7): empty currently.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6, 5): my body (second segment) \u2192 not safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5, 6): empty currently.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7, 6): empty currently.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**2. Immediate collision risk with enemy heads:**\n\nEnemy head at (4, 6). Their possible moves:\n- UP (4, 7)\n- DOWN (4, 5)\n- LEFT (3, 6) \u2014 their body segment? Wait, check enemy body list: (3, 6) is their second segment (after head at (4, 6)), so yes, body at (3, 6) \u2192 not safe for them.\n- RIGHT (5, 6) \u2014 empty.\n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow check overlap with my possible moves:\n\n**UP (6, 7):** enemy can\u2019t reach (6, 7) in one move. Safe.\n\n**LEFT (5, 6):** enemy could move RIGHT to (5, 6) \u2192 head-on collision risk! Avoid.\n\n**RIGHT (7, 6):** enemy can\u2019t reach (7, 6) in one move. Safe.\n\nSo LEFT is risky because enemy could move RIGHT into same cell.\n\n---\n\n**3. Apple positions and distances:**\n\nFrom (6, 6):\n- (4, 8): Manhattan distance 4\n- (8, 9): Manhattan distance 5\n- (1, 1): distance 10\n- (2, 0): distance 10\n- (8, 1): distance 7\n\n(4, 8) is closest, but enemy is near that area at (4, 6). Might be contested.\n\n---\n\n**4. Future move options after safe moves:**\n\n**UP to (6, 7):**\nNext turn safe moves? Body will be at [(6, 6), (6, 5), \u2026] unless eat apple this turn.\nFrom (6, 7):\nUP (6, 8), DOWN (6, 6) \u2014 body (tail moved?), actually next turn tail will be at (6, 1) gone if no apple eaten? Wait, length 8, moving without eating \u2192 tail moves off (6, 1), so (6, 6) becomes body segment? Let\u2019s track: current body: [(6, 5), \u2026 (6, 1)]. If I move UP to (6, 7), new head (6, 7), new body = [old head (6, 6)] + [old body minus last segment (6, 1)]. So new body: [(6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1)] \u2014 yes, last segment (6, 1) removed.\nSo from (6, 7) next turn: UP (6, 8) empty, DOWN (6, 6) my body \u2192 not safe, LEFT (5, 7) empty, RIGHT (7, 7) empty. So safe: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).\n\n**RIGHT to (7, 6):**\nNew head (7, 6), new body: [(6, 6), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1)].\nFrom (7, 6) next turn: UP (7, 7) empty, DOWN (7, 5) empty, LEFT (6, 6) body \u2192 not safe, RIGHT (8, 6) empty. Safe: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT give 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**5. Enemy threat analysis:**\n\nEnemy at (4, 6) could go RIGHT to (5, 6) \u2014 that\u2019s my LEFT move, so avoid LEFT.\nEnemy could go UP to (4, 7) \u2014 closer to apple (4, 8).\nEnemy could go DOWN to (4, 5).\n\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (5, 6), they\u2019re adjacent to my head if I go LEFT \u2192 collision. So LEFT is dangerous.\n\nIf enemy goes UP to (4, 7), they\u2019re moving toward (4, 8) apple, not threatening me directly.\n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (4, 5), moving away.\n\nGiven enemy\u2019s length (12 apples = length 13), they may avoid risky collisions, but they could still take (5, 6) if they want.\n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term planning:**\n\nI\u2019m behind (7 vs 12 apples). Need to collect apples safely while avoiding enemy.\n\nApple (8, 9) is far but reachable via right side.\nApple (4, 8) is closer but enemy near.\nApple (8, 1) is far but could be backup.\n\nGoing UP puts me closer to (4, 8) and (8, 9) in future moves.\nGoing RIGHT moves me toward right edge, maybe toward (8, 9) later.\n\nUP feels safer because:\n- No immediate head-on risk.\n- Puts me in position to go toward (8, 9) via (7, 7) next turn if enemy takes (4, 8).\n- Avoids moving toward enemy\u2019s possible RIGHT move.\n\nRIGHT also safe, but moves me closer to right wall \u2014 could limit future flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nGo UP now to (6, 7). Next turn, assess enemy position. If enemy moved toward (4, 8), maybe go RIGHT toward (7, 7) then (8, 8) to approach (8, 9). If enemy stayed near (4, 6), maybe go UP again toward (6, 8) to approach top apples.\n\n---\n\n**Final safe moves:** UP, RIGHT. LEFT is risky due to possible head-on collision.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT, UP gives slightly better central position and more escape routes upward.\n\n**Choice:** UP\n\nUP",

Possible moves from (7,7):  \n- **UP**: (7,8) \u2013 empty on board? Board shows row 8: (4,8) is enemy head, but (7,8) is empty currently. Check collisions: No enemy body at (7,8), no my body there. Safe from immediate death.  \n- **DOWN**: (7,6) \u2013 empty? Row 6 col 7 = (7,6) is empty (board shows '.' at (7,6) in row 6). No collision with my body (my body: (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), etc. \u2013 (7,6) not in list).  \n- **LEFT**: (6,7) \u2013 that's my own body segment directly behind head. Moving LEFT would hit myself \u2192 immediate death.  \n- **RIGHT**: (8,7) \u2013 empty? Row 7 col 8 = (8,7) is empty. No enemy body there.  \n\nSo **LEFT** is out immediately.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Check for enemy head collision possibilities this turn:  \nEnemy head at (4,8). Their possible moves:  \n- From (4,8): UP (4,9) \u2013 empty? Apple at (8,9) but (4,9) empty.  \n- DOWN (4,7) \u2013 their own body segment (4,7) is their neck \u2192 they can't go DOWN (suicide).  \n- LEFT (3,8) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT (5,8) \u2013 empty.  \n\nThey could move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT safely.  \n\nIf they move RIGHT to (5,8), that's far from my possible moves.  \nIf they move UP to (4,9), no conflict.  \nIf they move LEFT to (3,8), no conflict.  \n\nNo possible same-cell head-on collision with me from their current position because I\u2019m at (7,7), they\u2019re at (4,8), Manhattan distance = |7-4|+|7-8|=3+1=4, so can't meet in one move unless we both move toward each other diagonally, which isn't possible in grid moves. So head-on collision impossible this turn.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Check other death risks:  \nNo enemy body in my candidate squares: (7,8), (7,6), (8,7). All are empty '.' on board.  \nAll within 0\u20139 bounds.  \n\nSo UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe immediately.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Apples and future options:  \nClosest apple to my head:  \n- (8,9): distance |7-8|+|7-9|=1+2=3  \n- (2,6): distance |7-2|+|7-6|=5+1=6  \n- (8,1): distance |7-8|+|7-1|=1+6=7  \n- (1,1): far  \n- (2,0): far  \n\nApple at (8,9) is closest.  \n\nFrom (7,7):  \n- UP (7,8) \u2192 then apple at (8,9) is at distance 2 (right+up).  \n- RIGHT (8,7) \u2192 then apple at (8,9) is distance 2 (up+up).  \n- DOWN (7,6) \u2192 farther from (8,9).  \n\nSo UP or RIGHT moves me closer to the nearest apple.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Future move safety after each candidate:  \n- **UP to (7,8)**:  \n  Next turn from (7,8): possible moves UP (7,9), DOWN (7,7) \u2013 currently empty but might be risky if enemy moves there? Actually (7,7) will be empty after I leave. LEFT (6,8), RIGHT (8,8). All four likely safe next turn unless enemy moves into one. Seems fine.  \n\n- **RIGHT to (8,7)**:  \n  Next turn from (8,7): UP (8,8), DOWN (8,6), LEFT (7,7) \u2013 empty, RIGHT (9,7) \u2013 within board. Also fine.  \n\n- **DOWN to (7,6)**:  \n  Next turn from (7,6): UP (7,7) empty, DOWN (7,5) empty, LEFT (6,6) \u2013 my body at (6,6)? Wait, my body: (6,7),(6,6),(6,5)... yes, (6,6) is my body segment, so LEFT from (7,6) next turn would be into my own body \u2192 reduces future options. RIGHT (8,6) empty. So DOWN now reduces future flexibility slightly.  \n\nSo DOWN is worse for future options.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Enemy proximity:  \nEnemy at (4,8) is 3 cells away horizontally and 1 vertically. They might go for apple at (2,6) or (1,1) but not immediate threat to me.  \n\n---\n\n### 7. Decision:  \nBetween UP and RIGHT:  \nUP gets me closer to apple (8,9) slightly more directly (only need right+up next), RIGHT also gets closer but needs up+up next.  \nChecking board: from (8,7) to (8,9): up twice. From (7,8) to (8,9): right once, up once. Same Manhattan distance next step.  \n\nBut also considering board edges:  \nUP to (7,8) is near top row (y=9), but not trapped.  \nRIGHT to (8,7) is near right edge (x=9), but not trapped.  \n\nBoth fine.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose **UP** because it keeps me central and moves toward nearest apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove toward (8,9) apple while monitoring enemy #0's long body that spans left side of board. Avoid getting trapped along top edge. Consider going for (2,6) apple later if enemy not heading there, but (8,9) is priority now.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Possible moves for enemy:  \nUP: (5, 10) \u2192 off board \u2192 illegal.  \nDOWN: (5, 8) \u2192 board row 8 col 5: `.` empty.  \nLEFT: (4, 9) \u2192 occupied by enemy body (4, 9) is second segment \u2192 illegal.  \nRIGHT: (6, 9) \u2192 empty currently.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe moves are DOWN or RIGHT.  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (6, 9) and I move LEFT to (6, 9), we collide head-on. If enemy moves DOWN to (5, 8), I can move LEFT safely. But I don\u2019t know which they\u2019ll pick.\n\n---\n\n**3. Safe moves for me:**\n\nFrom step 1:  \nUP \u2192 off board \u2192 no.  \nDOWN \u2192 into own body \u2192 no.  \nLEFT \u2192 possibly head-on collision if enemy moves RIGHT.  \nRIGHT \u2192 safe (only possible conflict if enemy moves RIGHT then UP? No, enemy can\u2019t reach (8, 9) in one move from (5, 9).)\n\nSo **RIGHT** is definitely safe from immediate death and head-on collision this turn.  \nLEFT is risky.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Strategic benefit:**\n\nRIGHT moves to (8, 9) which is an apple \u2192 grow by 1, score +1.  \nThat also gets my head away from enemy head proximity.\n\nAfter eating apple at (8, 9), my new head at (8, 9), my body will be: head (8, 9), then old head (7, 9) becomes segment 2, etc. I grow by 1 so tail stays same length? Wait: when you eat apple, you grow by 1 segment at next move. Actually in Snake, you grow over the next moves: after eating, the tail doesn\u2019t move next turn. But here, \"grow by 1 segment\" means length increases immediately after moving onto apple? Usually in these games, after moving onto apple, the tail doesn\u2019t move that turn, so length increases by 1 starting next turn. But regardless, it\u2019s safe and gets apple.\n\n---\n\n**5. Future options from (8, 9):**\n\nFrom (8, 9): possible moves next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (8, 10) off board \u2192 no.  \nDOWN \u2192 (8, 8) currently empty (row 8 col 8: `.`).  \nLEFT \u2192 (7, 9) currently my old head, but after move it\u2019ll be my body segment \u2192 not safe next turn.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9, 9) empty.  \n\nSo from (8, 9) next turn, DOWN or RIGHT available. That\u2019s only 2 safe moves, which is okay but not great. But eating apple is good.\n\n---\n\n**6. Alternative: LEFT if enemy not moving RIGHT?**\n\nIf I assume enemy will move DOWN (maybe to avoid me?), LEFT to (6, 9) is safe and gives more options next turn:  \nFrom (6, 9): UP off board, DOWN to (6, 8) empty, LEFT to (5, 9) currently enemy head but enemy will move, so next turn (5, 9) empty, RIGHT to (7, 9) my body. So DOWN or LEFT safe next turn. Also 2 options. No apple.\n\nBut risk: if enemy moves RIGHT, we both die. Enemy might choose RIGHT because it\u2019s safe and maybe aims for apple at (8, 9)? But apple at (8, 9) is 3 steps away for enemy, so not this turn. They might avoid risk and go DOWN to (5, 8) towards apple at (2, 6)? Possibly.\n\nGiven scores: enemy has 13 apples, I have 7. I need apples. RIGHT gets apple safely. LEFT risks death for no apple. So RIGHT is clearly better.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for future:**  \nAfter eating apple at (8, 9), next turn I must go DOWN or RIGHT. RIGHT from (8, 9) to (9, 9) then only DOWN from there likely. Might get trapped top right. Better to go DOWN next turn to (8, 8) for more options. Then work towards other apples like (8, 1) or (2, 6), but avoid enemy.\n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nRIGHT",

Check each move for immediate death:**  \n\n- **UP** from (8, 9) \u2192 (8, 10) \u2192 off board \u2192 illegal.  \n- **DOWN** from (8, 9) \u2192 (8, 8) \u2192 currently empty (board shows '.' at row 8 col 8). No static obstacle.  \n- **LEFT** from (8, 9) \u2192 (7, 9) \u2192 occupied by my own body (first segment after head) \u2192 illegal (moving backwards into own body).  \n- **RIGHT** from (8, 9) \u2192 (9, 9) \u2192 empty (board row 9 col 9 is '.').  \n\nSo only **DOWN** and **RIGHT** are safe from static obstacles.  \n\n---\n\n**2. Check head-on collision risk this turn:**  \n\nEnemy head at (5, 8).  \nPossible enemy moves:  \n- UP: (5, 9) \u2192 occupied by enemy body (5, 9) is in enemy body list \u2192 illegal.  \n- DOWN: (5, 7) \u2192 empty (row 7 col 5 is '.').  \n- LEFT: (4, 8) \u2192 empty (row 8 col 4 is 'T'? Wait, board row 8: `. . . . T 0 A T . .` \u2192 col 4 is 'T' (enemy tail), so occupied by enemy body \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT: (6, 8) \u2192 empty (row 8 col 6 is 'A'? No, row 8 col 6 is '.' actually? Let's check: row 8: x=0 '.', x=1 '.', x=2 '.', x=3 '.', x=4 'T', x=5 '0', x=6 '.', x=7 'A', x=8 'T', x=9 '.'. So (6, 8) is '.'.)  \n\nSo enemy can go DOWN to (5, 7) or RIGHT to (6, 8).  \n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (8, 8), enemy can't reach (8, 8) in one move \u2192 safe from head-on.  \nIf I go **RIGHT** to (9, 9), enemy can't reach (9, 9) in one move \u2192 safe from head-on.  \n\nSo both DOWN and RIGHT are safe from head-on collisions.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Strategic considerations:**  \n\nFrom (8, 9):  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9, 9): next turn, only DOWN from (9, 9) is safe (UP off board, LEFT into my body at (8, 9), RIGHT off board). That\u2019s a dead end next turn unless I eat apple at (9, 9)? There\u2019s no apple there. So going RIGHT now traps me badly.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8, 8): next turn from (8, 8), possible moves: UP back to (8, 9) (my old head, now body) \u2192 not safe; DOWN to (8, 7) empty; LEFT to (7, 8) my body \u2192 not safe; RIGHT to (9, 8) empty. So DOWN or RIGHT next turn \u2192 two options.  \n\nAlso, apple at (8, 1) far below, apple at (6, 8) is close but currently occupied? Wait, apple at (6, 8) is listed? Yes, apples: (6, 8) is in list. Board row 8 col 7 is 'A'? No, row 8 col 7 is 'A' (8, 7)? Wait, that\u2019s (8, 7) not (6, 8). Let's check: apples listed: (1, 1), (2, 0), (8, 1), (2, 6), (6, 8).  \nSo (6, 8) is an apple.  \n\nCurrently (6, 8) is '.' on board (row 8 col 6 '.'), so apple is not shown? That means maybe board representation is outdated? But game state says apples at (6, 8). Let's trust game state.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 8), next turn I can go DOWN to (8, 7) (not apple) or RIGHT to (9, 8) (not apple). I could aim for (6, 8) by going LEFT later, but my body blocks (7, 8) now.  \n\nActually, from (8, 8), to reach (6, 8) I\u2019d need: (8, 8) \u2192 (7, 8) next turn? That\u2019s my body now, but after moving, my body will shift: head to (8, 8), body[0] = (8, 9), body[1] = (7, 9), body[2] = (7, 8), etc. So (7, 8) will be my 3rd segment next turn, so moving LEFT from (8, 8) to (7, 8) would be into my own body \u2192 illegal. So can\u2019t get to (6, 8) directly next turn.  \n\nBut maybe I can go DOWN to (8, 7) and then LEFT over turns to approach (6, 8) later.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Enemy movement prediction:**  \n\nEnemy can go DOWN to (5, 7) or RIGHT to (6, 8).  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (6, 8), they eat apple (6, 8) and grow, blocking that apple from me.  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (5, 7), they move toward bottom left apples.  \n\nI can\u2019t control that, but going RIGHT now puts me in a bad spot with only one move next turn. That\u2019s too risky.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Conclusion:**  \n\nDOWN is safe now and keeps more options next turn.  \nRIGHT is safe now but leads to certain trap.  \n\nSo **DOWN** is better.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 8), I\u2019ll have DOWN to (8, 7) or RIGHT to (9, 8). Prefer DOWN to work toward lower apples (8, 1) eventually, but also keep path open to left side apples. Avoid top-right corner trap.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Check each move for immediate death:**  \n\n- **UP** from (8, 8) \u2192 (8, 9) \u2192 occupied by my own body (first segment after head) \u2192 illegal.  \n- **DOWN** from (8, 8) \u2192 (8, 7) \u2192 currently empty (board shows '.' at row 7 col 8).  \n- **LEFT** from (8, 8) \u2192 (7, 8) \u2192 occupied by my own body (third segment) \u2192 illegal.  \n- **RIGHT** from (8, 8) \u2192 (9, 8) \u2192 empty (board row 8 col 9 is '.').  \n\nSo **DOWN** and **RIGHT** are safe from static obstacles.  \n\n---\n\n**2. Check head-on collision risk this turn:**  \n\nEnemy head at (6, 8).  \nPossible enemy moves:  \n- UP: (6, 9) \u2192 board row 9 col 6 is '.' \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN: (6, 7) \u2192 board row 7 col 6 is 'T' (enemy body) \u2192 illegal.  \n- LEFT: (5, 8) \u2192 board row 8 col 5 is 'T' (enemy body) \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT: (7, 8) \u2192 board row 8 col 7 is 'A'? Wait, apples list doesn\u2019t include (7, 8), board row 8 col 7 is '.' actually (check: row 8 string `. . . . T T 0 T 1 .` \u2192 col 7 is 'T'? Let's index: x=0 '.', x=1 '.', x=2 '.', x=3 '.', x=4 'T', x=5 'T', x=6 '0', x=7 'T', x=8 '1', x=9 '.'. So (7, 8) is 'T' (enemy body). So illegal.  \n\nSo enemy can only go UP to (6, 9).  \n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (8, 7), enemy can't reach (8, 7) in one move \u2192 safe from head-on.  \nIf I go **RIGHT** to (9, 8), enemy can't reach (9, 8) in one move \u2192 safe from head-on.  \n\nSo both DOWN and RIGHT safe from head-on collisions.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Strategic considerations:**  \n\nFrom (8, 8):  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8, 7): next turn moves: UP back to (8, 8) (my old head, now body) \u2192 not safe; DOWN to (8, 6) empty; LEFT to (7, 7) my body \u2192 not safe; RIGHT to (9, 7) empty. So DOWN or RIGHT next turn \u2192 two options.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9, 8): next turn moves: UP to (9, 9) empty; DOWN to (9, 7) empty; LEFT to (8, 8) my body \u2192 not safe; RIGHT off board. So UP or DOWN next turn \u2192 two options.  \n\nBoth give 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Apples proximity:**  \n\nApples: (8, 1) far down, (4, 3) left, (2, 6) left, (2, 0) bottom left, (1, 1) bottom left.  \nEnemy is at (6, 8) moving UP to (6, 9).  \n\nFrom (8, 7), I can go DOWN toward (8, 1) eventually.  \nFrom (9, 8), I\u2019m farther from apples and moving right edge limits space.  \n\nAlso, enemy might go UP to (6, 9), then next turn could threaten area near (6, 8) apple? Wait, apple (6, 8) is not in list anymore? Actually apples list now is (1, 1), (2, 0), (8, 1), (2, 6), (4, 3). So (6, 8) apple was eaten last turn? Yes, last turn\u2019s apple list included (6, 8), now it\u2019s gone \u2014 enemy must have eaten it when moving to (6, 8) last turn.  \n\nSo apples left: (8, 1) is closest to my path down.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Long-term planning:**  \n\nGoing DOWN starts descending toward (8, 1).  \nGoing RIGHT puts me near top-right corner \u2014 risk of getting trapped later.  \nDOWN feels safer for future flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 7), I\u2019ll have DOWN to (8, 6) or RIGHT to (9, 7). Prefer DOWN to continue toward apple (8, 1), but keep eye on enemy movements. Avoid moving into possible collision paths with enemy who may come down from top later.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Still, just in case my board reading is wrong, I should pick safest for next turn too.\n\nFrom (8, 6): next moves: UP back to (8, 7) (body? No \u2014 old head is at (8, 7) now body? Wait, after I move to (8, 6), my body becomes: head (8, 6), then (8, 7) is second segment (old head), so UP to (8, 7) is safe? No \u2014 that\u2019s moving into my own body (second segment) \u2192 illegal.
