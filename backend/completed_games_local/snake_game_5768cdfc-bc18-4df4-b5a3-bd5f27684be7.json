Hitting own body kills me, so UP is illegal.\n\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (5, 5)**  \n   Empty cell, inside board.\n\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (4, 6)**  \n   Empty cell, inside board.\n\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (6, 6)**  \n   Empty cell, inside board.\n\nSo UP is out. DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe from immediate self-collision and board edges.\n\n---\n\n**Check enemy collision risks (simultaneous movement):**\n\nEnemy head is at (6, 8). Possible moves for enemy:  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 9)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 7)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 8)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 8)  \n\nMy possible moves and enemy possible moves overlapping:\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 6):  \nEnemy moving DOWN to (6, 7) is safe (adjacent, not same cell).  \nEnemy moving LEFT to (5, 8) is safe.  \nEnemy moving RIGHT to (7, 8) safe.  \nEnemy moving UP safe.  \nNo head-on collision possible here because (6, 6) not in enemy\u2019s reach in one move (enemy max y difference = 1, but enemy at y=8, me at y=6 \u2192 difference 2). So safe.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 5):  \nEnemy can\u2019t reach (5, 5) in one move from (6, 8) \u2192 safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 6):  \nEnemy can\u2019t reach (4, 6) in one move \u2192 safe.\n\nSo no immediate head-on collision possible with enemy this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Future mobility after each move:**\n\nFrom (5, 5) \u2013 possible next moves:  \nUP back to (5, 6), LEFT (4, 5), RIGHT (6, 5), DOWN (5, 4) \u2192 all 4 could be safe unless my tail moves (tail at (5, 7) will move forward if no apple eaten). Wait: I didn\u2019t eat apple last turn (I moved from (5,7) to (5,6), no apple there). So my body length is 2 segments: head at (5,6), body at (5,7).  \nIf I move now without eating apple, my tail stays at (5,7)?? No: Snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves into previous segment\u2019s old position. So after my move:  \n- Head moves to new cell.  \n- Body segment at (5,7) moves to (5,6) (old head position).  \nSo after this turn, my body will be at [(new head), (5, 6)].\n\nThus, after moving DOWN to (5,5), my body occupies: head (5,5), body (5,6). Next turn possible moves from (5,5):  \nUP to (5,6) \u2192 occupied by my body \u2192 illegal.  \nLEFT (4,5), RIGHT (6,5), DOWN (5,4) \u2192 possibly safe. So 3 safe moves.\n\nFrom LEFT to (4,6):  \nAfter move: head (4,6), body (5,6). Next turn from (4,6):  \nUP (4,7), DOWN (4,5), LEFT (3,6), RIGHT (5,6) \u2192 but (5,6) is my body \u2192 so 3 safe moves.\n\nFrom RIGHT to (6,6):  \nAfter move: head (6,6), body (5,6). Next turn from (6,6):  \nUP (6,7), DOWN (6,5), LEFT (5,6) \u2192 my body \u2192 illegal, RIGHT (7,6) \u2192 safe. So 3 safe moves.\n\nAll 3 safe moves give 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**\n\nClosest apple to (5,6):  \n(1,6) distance |dx|=4, dy=0 \u2192 4 steps.  \n(6,2) dx=1, dy=-4 \u2192 5 steps.  \n(6,3) dx=1, dy=-3 \u2192 4 steps.  \n(2,8) dx=-3, dy=2 \u2192 5 steps.  \n(1,1) dx=-4, dy=-5 \u2192 far.\n\n(1,6) is reachable via LEFT moves.  \n(6,2) and (6,3) reachable via RIGHT then DOWN.\n\nRIGHT to (6,6) gets me closer to (6,2)/(6,3).  \nDOWN to (5,5) gets me closer to (6,2)/(6,3) as well (y decreases).  \nLEFT to (4,6) gets me closer to (1,6).\n\nEnemy at (6,8) might go for (2,8) apple or (1,6) apple? (1,6) is close to me if I go LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy threat:**  \nIf enemy moves toward (2,8), that\u2019s away from me. If enemy moves toward (1,6), he\u2019d need to go LEFT then DOWN many steps from (6,8). I can beat him to (1,6) if I go LEFT now.\n\nBut (1,6) is also close to my current position (4 steps for me, 5+ steps for enemy). Going LEFT to (4,6) puts me 3 steps away from (1,6). That\u2019s good.\n\n---\n\n**Choice:**  \nI\u2019ll go LEFT toward (1,6) because:  \n1. It\u2019s safe (no collision).  \n2. It gets me closer to an apple.  \n3. Enemy is far from that apple.  \n4. Future mobility remains good.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4,6), consider moving toward (1,6) via LEFT again if safe, or DOWN toward (1,1) or (6,2)/(6,3) cluster later. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s movement direction.\n\nLEFT",

So safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Immediate danger from enemy\u2019s possible moves this turn:**\n\nEnemy at (6, 5) can move to: (6, 6), (6, 4), (5, 5), (7, 5).\n\nMy candidate moves: (1, 8), (0, 7), (2, 7) \u2014 none are in those four enemy-reachable cells. No immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**\n\nFrom (1, 7):\n- (2, 8) is 2 steps away: (1, 7) \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 (2, 8) or (1, 7) \u2192 (2, 7) \u2192 (2, 8).\n- (2, 4) is farther: |1-2| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n- (1, 1) is far: |1-1| + |7-1| = 6.\n- (6, 2) and (6, 3) are far.\n\nClosest apple: (2, 8).\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**\n\n**UP to (1, 8):**\nNext turn body: head (1, 8), body [(1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6)].\nFrom (1, 8) possible moves: UP (1, 9) \u2013 in bounds, empty; DOWN (1, 7) \u2013 body segment (second segment), illegal; LEFT (0, 8) \u2013 empty; RIGHT (2, 8) \u2013 apple (safe if enemy not there).  \nSo next turn safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 moves).

Probably moves DOWN to (6, 4) or (6, 3).  \nApple (2, 8) is far from enemy, likely uncontested for now.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**\n\nUP gives best future mobility (3 safe moves next turn) and moves toward closest apple (2, 8).  \nRIGHT moves toward apple but reduces future options to 2 safe moves.  \nLEFT reduces future options and doesn\u2019t move toward apple.\n\nUP is optimal.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**\nAfter moving UP to (1, 8), next turn consider moving RIGHT to (2, 8) to eat apple if enemy not threatening. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s new position (likely around (6, 4) or (6, 3)). Avoid trapping myself in top row; maybe after eating apple, head down gradually toward central apples while maintaining space.\n\nUP",

Wait \u2014 check body list: body[0] = (1,8), yes that\u2019s directly behind head currently).

Safe moves for enemy:  \n- UP to (6,4) \u2014 body segment, unsafe.  \n- DOWN to (6,2) \u2014 apple there, safe.  \n- LEFT to (5,3) \u2014 empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT to (7,3) \u2014 empty, safe.  \n\nMost likely enemy will go DOWN to eat apple at (6,2) (shortest path to apple). But they could also move LEFT or RIGHT.  \n\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (6,2), they\u2019ll be far from me.

Wait, body moves forward too \u2014 by next turn, my body will be at [(2,8), (1,8), (1,7)], so (2,8) will be occupied by my body next turn, so moving back into (2,8) would be suicide). Actually let's check:  \nIf I move UP this turn, next turn head at (2,9), body = [(2,8), (1,8), (1,7)]. Then moving DOWN to (2,8) would hit my own body \u2014 so only 2 safe moves from (2,9): LEFT to (1,9) and RIGHT to (3,9). That\u2019s low mobility (2 options).  \n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (2,7): Next moves from there:  \nBody next turn: [(2,7), (2,8), (1,8)], so (2,8) occupied.  \nFrom (2,7):  \n- UP \u2192 (2,8) occupied next turn \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,6) empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,7) empty (since tail was at (1,6) currently, but body moves forward, so (1,7) will be free? Wait: current body: (1,8), (1,7), (1,6). After moving DOWN to (2,7), new body: (2,7), (1,8), (1,7). So (1,7) occupied next turn. So LEFT from (2,7) next turn hits myself.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,7) empty.  \nSo only DOWN and RIGHT safe next turn from (2,7) \u2192 2 options.  \n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (3,8): Next moves from there:  \nBody next turn: [(3,8), (2,8), (1,8)].  \nFrom (3,8):  \n- UP \u2192 (3,9) empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,7) empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,8) occupied (my body).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,8) empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\nRIGHT gives best mobility (3 options).  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4 \u2014 Path to apples  \nClosest apples: (2,4) is 4 steps away, (1,1) is 7 steps away, (5,5) is 5 steps away, (6,2) is 6 steps away, (8,6) is 8 steps away.  \n\nFrom (3,8), moving DOWN over several turns gets me closer to (2,4) and (5,5).  \n\nRIGHT also keeps me away from enemy currently at (6,3).  \n\n---\n\n### Step 5 \u2014 Avoid head-on collisions  \nEnemy at (6,3) could move LEFT to (5,3) or RIGHT to (7,3) or DOWN to (6,2).

Moving RIGHT to (7, 2) keeps us aligned for a potential path towards this apple.\n- **Enemy Snake Movement:** Snake #1's head is at (3, 8) and moving downwards.

This move allows us to maintain flexibility and keeps us in a good position to collect the apple at (5, 5) in future turns.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- In the next few turns, prioritize moving towards the apple at (5, 5) while keeping an eye on Snake #1's movements.\n- Be ready to adjust our path if Snake #1 starts to threaten our position or if new opportunities arise.\n\nRIGHT.",

No immediate danger.\n\n2. **Apple Proximity:**\n   - The closest apple is at (2, 4), which is 5 units away diagonally.\n   - Moving RIGHT or DOWN will bring us closer to this apple.\n\n3. **Future Moves and Options:**\n   - Moving RIGHT opens up more board space and potential future moves.\n   - Moving DOWN keeps us in a relatively open area but might limit future options if the enemy snake moves down.\n\n4. **Enemy Snake Movement:**\n   - The enemy snake's head is at (3, 6). If it moves DOWN, it will be at (3, 5), which is not a direct threat.\n   - If it moves LEFT, RIGHT, or UP, it will also not be a direct threat.\n\n### Long-Term Plan\n\nFor the next few turns, I should aim to move RIGHT to open up more board space and keep my options flexible. This will also gradually bring me closer to the apple at (2, 4). I should avoid moving DOWN too frequently to prevent getting trapped in the lower part of the board.\n\n### Final Move Decision\n\nRIGHT",

No immediate danger, keeps you in a relatively open area.\n   - **LEFT:** Safe, moves to (8, 6). No immediate danger, keeps you in a relatively open area.\n   - **RIGHT:** Not safe, moves off the board.\n\n2. **Apple Proximity:**\n   - The closest apple is at (8, 6), which is 1 unit away if we move LEFT or DOWN.\n   - Moving LEFT or DOWN gets us closer to the apple at (8, 6) and keeps us in a relatively open area.\n\n3. **Future Moves and Options:**\n   - Moving LEFT or DOWN opens up more board space and keeps our options flexible.\n   - Moving UP keeps us in a relatively open area but doesn't get us closer to any apple.\n\n4. **Enemy Snake Movement:**\n   - The enemy snake's head is at (1, 3). If it moves UP, it will potentially move to (1, 4), which is not a direct threat.\n   - If it moves RIGHT, it will also not be a direct threat.\n\n### Long-Term Plan\n\nFor the next few turns, I should aim to move LEFT to open up more board space and keep my options flexible. This will also gradually bring me closer to the apple at (8, 6). I should avoid moving RIGHT or UP too frequently to prevent getting trapped in the upper part of the board.\n\nLEFT",

New head at (1, 1), body becomes: old head (1, 2) added to front of body list, tail stays same unless apple eaten \u2014 actually, when eating apple, tail doesn\u2019t move, length increases by 1.  \nBut after eating apple at (1, 1), my body will be: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5)] \u2192 length 6.  \n\nNext turn from (1, 1): possible moves: UP (1, 2) \u2192 my body segment after move? Wait, careful:  \nAt end of this turn, my body: head (1, 1), then (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5).  \nSo next turn, UP to (1, 2) would be moving into my own body segment at (1, 2) \u2192 not safe.  \nFrom (1, 1): moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 occupied (my body) \u2192 not safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 0) \u2192 empty (board safe).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 1) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 1) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo DOWN from (1, 1) gives only 2 safe moves next turn (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT = 3 actually? Wait: UP unsafe, DOWN safe, LEFT safe, RIGHT safe = 3 safe moves. Yes, 3 safe moves next turn if I go DOWN now.  \n\n---\n\n**LEFT to (0, 2):**  \nNo apple. New head (0, 2), body: [(0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5)] \u2014 tail (2, 5) removed (since no apple), so length stays 5.  \nFrom (0, 2) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 3) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 1) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 not safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 occupied by my body \u2192 not safe.  \n\nSo only UP and DOWN safe next turn \u2192 2 options.  \n\n---\n\n**RIGHT to (2, 2):**  \nNo apple. New head (2, 2), body: [(2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5)] \u2014 tail removed, length 5.  \nFrom (2, 2) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 1) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 occupied (my body) \u2192 not safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 2) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe \u2192 3 options.  \n\n---\n\n**4) Compare:**  \nDOWN: gets apple, grows to 6, 3 safe moves next turn from (1, 1).  \nLEFT: no apple, 2 safe moves next turn from (0, 2).  \nRIGHT: no apple, 3 safe moves next turn from (2, 2).  \n\nGetting apple is good for score (I have 4 vs enemy 3, so extending lead). Also, growth increases my reach but also risk of trapping myself later \u2014 but here board is open near (1, 1).  \n\nFrom (1, 1) after eating, I can go DOWN to (1, 0) then RIGHT to (2, 0) etc., staying flexible.  \n\n---\n\n**5) Long-term plan:**  \nAfter eating apple at (1, 1), head to open area bottom-left to avoid enemy possibly coming for central apples. Enemy is far away at (8, 6). Next apple targets: (0, 5) or (5, 5) could be approached safely via bottom rows. Avoid moving toward enemy until necessary.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN gets apple safely, extends lead, keeps reasonable future mobility.  \n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Let's break this down step by step.  \n\n**Current state:**  \nMy snake head: (2,1)  \nBody: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4)]  \nEnemy snake head: (7,7), body: [(7,6),(8,6),(9,6)]  \nApples: (5,5), (0,5), (9,9), (5,8), (8,8)  \n\nBoard coordinates: bottom-left (0,0), top-right (9,9).  \n\n---\n\n**1. Possible moves from (2,1):**  \n\n- UP \u2192 (2,2)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,0)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,1)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,1)  \n\n---\n\n**2. Eliminate deadly moves:**  \n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1,1): That's the second segment of my snake (body[0]), so moving left would crash into myself \u2192 **not safe**.  \n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2,0): Within board, not my body (body has (1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,4)), not enemy body (enemy body at (7,6),(8,6),(9,6)), not enemy head (enemy head at (7,7)). So safe *unless* enemy moves into (2,0) this turn \u2014 unlikely since enemy is far away at (7,7).  \n\n- **UP** \u2192 (2,2): Within board, not my body, not enemy body, far from enemy head currently. Safe.  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,1): Within board, not my body, not enemy body, safe.  \n\nSo LEFT is out, others seem safe from immediate collision with current known positions.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Consider enemy possible moves:**  \n\nEnemy head at (7,7): possible moves: UP\u2192(7,8), DOWN\u2192(7,6), LEFT\u2192(6,7), RIGHT\u2192(8,7).  \n\nEnemy body: (7,6) is directly below head, so DOWN into (7,6) would be suicide (its own body) \u2014 unlikely unless enemy is suicidal. So enemy likely avoids DOWN.  \n\nFrom (7,7), UP is safe (no body there), LEFT safe, RIGHT safe.  \n\nBut enemy\u2019s move doesn\u2019t threaten me directly unless it goes all the way to my coordinates in one move \u2014 impossible. So no direct head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Future options & apple proximity:**  \n\nApples:  \n- (5,5): Manhattan distance from (2,1) = |3|+|4| = 7  \n- (0,5): distance = |2|+|4| = 6  \n- (9,9): far  \n- (5,8): far  \n- (8,8): far  \n\nClosest is (0,5) distance 6, but that\u2019s up and left from me.  \n\nFrom (2,1):  \n- UP (2,2): gets slightly closer to (0,5) distance now 5? Wait: from (2,2) to (0,5): |2|+|3|=5, yes better than from (2,1) (which was 6).  \n- RIGHT (3,1): to (0,5): |3|+|4|=7 \u2014 farther.  \n- DOWN (2,0): to (0,5): |2|+|5|=7 \u2014 farther.  \n\nSo UP improves distance to closest apple (0,5).  \n\nAlso, (0,5) is not blocked by enemy or me currently. My body is mostly on left column (x=1) from y=1 to y=4, so going UP then LEFT later might be okay.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Future mobility after each move:**  \n\nCheck each safe move\u2019s next turn options:  \n\n- UP to (2,2): possible next moves from there:  \n  - UP (2,3): free? My body has (1,3) but not (2,3), so free.  \n  - DOWN (2,1): my body? No, that\u2019s where I just came from, but it\u2019s now empty because head moved. Actually, body[0] is (1,1), so (2,1) is empty \u2014 so DOWN is safe next turn.  \n  - LEFT (1,2): my body? Body has (1,2) \u2014 yes, that\u2019s a body segment! So LEFT from (2,2) next turn would be into myself. That\u2019s bad.  \n  - RIGHT (3,2): free.  \n\nSo from (2,2), next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options). LEFT is unsafe.  \n\n- RIGHT to (3,1): next turn from (3,1):  \n  - UP (3,2): free  \n  - DOWN (3,0): free  \n  - LEFT (2,1): free (was head\u2019s old spot, now empty)  \n  - RIGHT (4,1): free  \n\nAll 4 directions safe next turn \u2014 better mobility.  \n\n- DOWN to (2,0): next turn from (2,0):  \n  - UP (2,1): free  \n  - DOWN (2,-1): off board \u2192 invalid  \n  - LEFT (1,0): free  \n  - RIGHT (3,0): free  \n\nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nSo RIGHT gives best mobility (4 options), UP gives 3 options but one is into future body if I don\u2019t plan well, DOWN gives 3 options but near bottom edge.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term:**  \n\nApple at (0,5) is tempting but my body blocks leftward movement along x=1 from y=1 to y=4. To get to (0,5), I\u2019d need to go up first to y=5 then left, but my body at (1,4) and (2,4) blocks some paths. Actually, from (2,2), going UP to (2,3), then UP to (2,4) \u2014 oh, (2,4) is my tail currently. But tail moves forward when I move, so by the time I get to (2,4), it might have moved if I grow. But if I don\u2019t eat an apple, tail stays at (2,4) until I move enough.  \n\nBetter to keep options open. RIGHT gives best mobility now and doesn\u2019t trap me.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nTry to approach (0,5) by going up first, but avoid getting trapped by my own body along left column. Move right to open space, then loop up toward apple while keeping enemy in mind.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy possible moves this turn:**  \nEnemy head at (6,7), body at (7,7), (7,6), (8,6).  \nEnemy possible moves: UP\u2192(6,8), DOWN\u2192(6,6), LEFT\u2192(5,7), RIGHT\u2192(7,7). RIGHT\u2192(7,7) is its own body \u2192 suicide \u2192 unlikely unless forced. So enemy likely avoids RIGHT.  \nFrom (6,7), safe enemy moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \nNone threaten my head directly this turn (too far).  \n\n---\n\n**4. Apple proximity:**  \nFrom (3,1):  \n- (5,5): Manhattan distance = |2|+|4| = 6  \n- (0,5): distance = |3|+|4| = 7  \n- (9,9): far  \n- (5,8): far  \n- (8,8): far  \n\nClosest apple is (5,5) distance 6.  \n\nCheck each move\u2019s effect on distance to (5,5):  \n- UP to (3,2): to (5,5) = |2|+|3| = 5 \u2192 improves.  \n- DOWN to (3,0): to (5,5) = |2|+|5| = 7 \u2192 worse.  \n- RIGHT to (4,1): to (5,5) = |1|+|4| = 5 \u2192 improves same as UP.  \n\nSo UP and RIGHT both get me closer to (5,5).  \n\n---\n\n**5. Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n- **UP to (3,2)**: next turn possible moves from (3,2):  \n  - UP (3,3): free  \n  - DOWN (3,1): free (currently head\u2019s spot, will be empty after move)  \n  - LEFT (2,2): free (no body there)  \n  - RIGHT (4,2): free  \n  All 4 moves safe next turn \u2192 good mobility.  \n\n- **RIGHT to (4,1)**: next turn from (4,1):  \n  - UP (4,2): free  \n  - DOWN (4,0): free  \n  - LEFT (3,1): free (old head spot empty)  \n  - RIGHT (5,1): free  \n  All 4 moves safe \u2192 good mobility.  \n\n- **DOWN to (3,0)**: next turn from (3,0):  \n  - UP (3,1): free  \n  - DOWN (3,-1): off board \u2192 invalid  \n  - LEFT (2,0): free  \n  - RIGHT (4,0): free  \n  So 3 safe moves \u2192 slightly worse due to bottom edge.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term planning:**  \nMy body blocks column x=1 from y=1 to y=4, so moving left later is tricky.  \nApple at (5,5) is central, moving UP or RIGHT helps.  \nEnemy is at (6,7) \u2014 not an immediate threat, but could compete for (5,5) or (5,8).  \n\nFrom (3,2), I could go RIGHT then UP toward (5,5).  \nFrom (4,1), I could go UP then RIGHT toward (5,5).  \nBoth are fine, but UP puts me slightly closer in y-coordinate to (5,5) than RIGHT does.  \n\nAlso, enemy might head toward (5,8) or (8,8) given its position.  \n\n---\n\n**7. Avoid potential head-on collision risk:**  \nNo enemy move this turn can reach my candidate cells (3,2), (4,1), (3,0). So all safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nBoth UP and RIGHT improve distance to nearest apple and give good future mobility.  \nUP gives a slightly better y-position for reaching (5,5) next.  \nAlso, moving UP avoids the bottom edge, keeps central options open.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose **UP**.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter moving to (3,2), aim for (5,5) via (4,2) \u2192 (4,3) \u2192 (5,3) \u2192 (5,4) \u2192 (5,5), but watch enemy movement. Keep an escape route open. Avoid trapping myself near my own body on left column.  \n\nUP",
