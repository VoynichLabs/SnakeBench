I should avoid competing directly for that apple.\n\nThe apple directly below me at (7, 0) is 6 steps away (DOWN) and I'm the closest snake to it. This seems like a good safe target.\n\nMoving DOWN puts me on a direct path to the apple at (7, 0) with no competition.\n\nLooking at my options:\n- UP moves me toward potential future apples but increases distance to the nearest safe apple\n- DOWN moves me toward the nearest apple with no competition\n- LEFT moves me away from apples\n- RIGHT moves me away from apples\n\nDOWN seems like the best strategic choice as it targets the closest uncontested apple while keeping me safe.\n\nShort-term strategy: Head directly for the apple at (7, 0) to secure my first point without competition.\n\nDOWN",

While a mutual kill would still leave me winning on apples (5 vs 2), I should avoid the gamble when safe alternatives exist.\n- UP -> (5,4): safe, keeps options, moves away from the immediate contest.\n- RIGHT -> (6,3): safe, keeps more open space on my right and edges me toward the apple at (7,7) while avoiding a likely head-on.\n\nI prefer to avoid taking the head-on risk. Moving RIGHT keeps multiple escape options (UP, RIGHT, DOWN later) and doesn\u2019t walk into the enemy\u2019s one-move reach. Short plan: keep pressure on the right-side apples (7,7) or pivot back toward (3,0) if the enemy chases; avoid moving DOWN while the enemy can reach (5,2).\n\nRIGHT",
