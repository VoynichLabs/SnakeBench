Coordinates are 0-9.\n\nMy current position (Head): (1, 8).\n\nPossible moves and their resulting positions:\n1. UP: (1, 9) - Safe.\n2. DOWN: (1, 7) - Apple (0, 7) is nearby, but (1, 7) is not an apple. Safe.\n3. LEFT: (0, 8) - Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (2, 8) - Safe.\n\nAll initial moves are safe since I have no body segments and no immediate collisions with the board edges or the enemy snake are guaranteed (the enemy snake is far away).\n\nGoal: Get to an apple.\n\nNearest apples:\nA1 at (0, 7): Distance |1-0| + |8-7| = 1 + 1 = 2\nA2 at (1, 1): Distance |1-1| + |8-1| = 0 + 7 = 7\nA3 at (3, 0): Distance |1-3| + |8-0| = 2 + 8 = 10\nA4 at (6, 2): Distance |1-6| + |8-2| = 5 + 6 = 11\nA5 at (0, 0): Distance |1-0| + |8-0| = 1 + 8 = 9\n\nThe closest apple is A1 at (0, 7), distance 2.\n\nTo reach (0, 7):\nMove 1: Must move towards (0, 7).\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 7) (1 step closer to the apple's y-coordinate, 1 step closer overall).\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 8) (1 step closer to the apple's x-coordinate, 1 step closer overall).\n\nLet's evaluate DOWN and LEFT. Both moves get me closer by 1 step.\n\nOption DOWN to (1, 7): From here, I need to move LEFT to (0, 7) on the next turn.\nOption LEFT to (0, 8): From here, I need to move DOWN to (0, 7) on the next turn.\n\nBoth options lead to consuming the apple on Turn 1.\n\nLet's check the area around (1, 8) for immediate threats or better paths. The enemy snake is at (3, 4), quite far.\n\nIf I choose UP to (1, 9), I move away from all apples. (Bad)\nIf I choose RIGHT to (2, 8), I move slightly towards A3, A4 but away from A1, A2, A5. (Not optimal for the closest apple)\n\nComparing DOWN and LEFT:\nDOWN to (1, 7): This keeps me centered on x=1. Next move LEFT.\nLEFT to (0, 8): This moves me to the edge x=0. Next move DOWN.\n\nBoth are excellent, safe first moves. I'll choose the direction that feels slightly more flexible overall, although here they are almost identical in outcome for the first apple. Moving LEFT sets me up along the x=0 edge, which has another apple at (0, 0), and I would be further from the enemy snake on the x-axis.\n\nLet's pick LEFT.\n(1, 8) -> LEFT -> (0, 8).\nNext turn (Turn 1): (0, 8) -> DOWN -> (0, 7) (Apple!).\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to position myself for the apple at (0, 7) next turn.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy Snake Analysis (ID 0 Head (0, 1), Tail (1, 1)):\nEnemy is currently at (0, 1).\nPossible enemy moves:\n*   UP to (0, 2) (Collision risk with my DOWN move)\n*   DOWN to (0, 0) (Eats apple)\n*   LEFT to (-1, 1) (Off board, UNSAFE)\n*   RIGHT to (1, 1) (Backwards, UNSAFE, since (1, 1) is now the tail, the body was (1, 1), so moving back onto the *previous* body is safer than moving into the *current* body, but my current state says: Head: (0, 1), Body: [(1, 1)]. This means (1, 1) is the segment I just left.\n    *RE-CHECKING ENEMY BODY SEGMENTS*:\n    Head: (0, 1), Body: [(1, 1)]. The body segment is (1, 1). Moving RIGHT to (1, 1) is moving into its own body. UNSAFE.\n\nSafe enemy moves: (0, 2) (UP), (0, 0) (DOWN).\n\n4. Collision Risk Assessment:\n\n*   **My move DOWN to (0, 2):**\n    *   This cell (0, 2) is a potential target for Snake #0 if it moves UP from (0, 1). If both snakes move to (0, 2), it's a head-on collision, and both die.\n    *   Snake #0 also has the option to move DOWN to (0, 0), eating the apple.\n\n*   **My move RIGHT to (1, 3):**\n    *   This move avoids the conflict at (0, 2) and (0, 0), but takes me away from the target (0, 0). New D=5.\n    *   (1, 3) is safe from Snake #0, as D((0, 1), (1, 3)) = 1 + 2 = 3. Snake #0 cannot reach (1, 3) this turn.\n\n5. Strategy Evaluation:\n\nIf I move DOWN (0, 2):\n*   Scenario A: Enemy moves DOWN (0, 0), eats apple. I move to (0, 2). The target is gone, and I am now between the enemy and the wall, but I still have control of the vertical path.\n*   Scenario B: Enemy moves UP (0, 2). We collide, both die. Apples: 1-1 Draw. (High risk, must avoid.)\n\nSince Snake #0 has a direct path to the apple at (0, 0) by moving DOWN, and a dangerous path by moving UP to (0, 2), it is highly likely Snake #0 will go for the apple (0, 0).\nIf Snake #0 takes (0, 0), my path UP/DOWN is blocked for now, but I must survive. If Snake #0 moves to (0, 0), my move DOWN to (0, 2) is safe.\n\nHowever, the risk of a head-on collision is too high, especially this early with equal score. If Snake #0 is playing aggressively or defensively, moving UP (0, 2) to block or collide is a valid, though risky, strategy for them.\n\nLet's assume the enemy plays optimally to eat the closest available apple (0, 0) or move towards another goal. Given that (0, 0) is a direct win/point for Snake #0, it should prioritize that.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN to (0, 0) (optimal apple grab):\n- My move DOWN to (0, 2) is SAFE.\n- My move RIGHT to (1, 3) is SAFE.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (0, 2) (collision attempt/block):\n- My move DOWN to (0, 2) is FATAL.\n- My move RIGHT to (1, 3) is SAFE.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the severe consequence of collision, I need to choose the safe move RATHER than risk the grab. I can still pivot back to the wall or another apple.\n\nMove RIGHT to (1, 3) appears to be the only guaranteed safe move that keeps me alive if the enemy decides to block/collide at (0, 2).\n\nNew plan: Dodge the immediate vertical path conflict and pivot towards the next closest apples: (4, 2) (D=5) or (3, 0) (D=6). Moving RIGHT to (1, 3) maintains access to the rest of the board.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 3):\n- D to (4, 2) is |4-1| + |2-3| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n- D to (3, 0) is |3-1| + |0-3| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n- I am now closer to (4, 2).\n\nI will move RIGHT to avoid the collision risk with Snake #0 at (0, 2), sacrificing the apple at (0, 0) if Snake #0 takes it.\n\n**Short-term Plan:** Move RIGHT to (1, 3) to safety. Observe if Snake #0 takes (0, 0) or moves to (0, 2). If (0, 0) is gone, pivot towards (4, 2).\n\nRIGHT",

(Unless the tail (1, 1) moved out which it did not if it just ate an apple).\n    *Check body movement carefully*: Head (0, 0), Body (0, 1), (1, 1).

Collision Risk Assessment:\nMy Head: (1, 3). Enemy Head: (0, 0). Manhattan Distance is 4. No immediate head-to-head collision risk exists.\n\nPotential threats are if I move into their current or future body path, or if they trap me.\n\n*   If I move DOWN to (1, 2):\n    *   This move takes me directly towards (4, 2).

Strategy: Prioritize closest apple (4, 2). Both DOWN and RIGHT are equally strong (D=3 next turn).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 2): I am positioned well for the next move towards the apple, potentially (2, 2) or (3, 2).\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 3): I am positioned well for the next move towards the apple, potentially (3, 3) or (2, 2).\n\n(1, 2) is 2 units away from the y-coordinate of the apple (y=2).\n(2, 3) is 2 units away from the x-coordinate of the apple (x=4).\n\nMoving DOWN to (1, 2) allows for rapid descent towards the apple's row (y=2). Then I can move RIGHT in subsequent turns.\n(1, 3) -> DOWN -> (1, 2).\nNext turn (T8): From (1, 2), I can move RIGHT to (2, 2), reducing distance to 2, or UP/DOWN. (2, 2) is a very direct position.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2, 3) maintains the current y-level and requires a DOWN move later.\n(1, 3) -> RIGHT -> (2, 3).\nNext turn (T8): From (2, 3), I can move DOWN to (2, 2), reducing distance to 2, or RIGHT.\n\nBoth lead to (2, 2) on T8 (assuming no obstruction).\n(1, 3) -> (1, 2) [D=3] -> (2, 2) [D=2, T9: Eat at (3, 2) or (4, 2)? Wait, D from (2, 2) to (4, 2) is 2. (3, 2) is distance 1. (4, 2) is distance 2. Let's re-calculate: T9: from (2, 2) move RIGHT to (3, 2) or UP/DOWN/LEFT. T10: from (3, 2), move RIGHT to (4, 2) and eat. Estimated arrival T10.)\n\n(1, 3) -> (2, 3) [D=3] -> (2, 2) [D=2, T9: Move RIGHT to (3, 2). T10: Move RIGHT to (4, 2) and eat. Estimated arrival T10.)\n\nThe moves are functionally equivalent regarding distance to (4, 2) for the next couple of turns.\n\nLet's look at board control and future options. The enemy is moving RIGHT along y=0. If I move DOWN, I keep closer to the wall, isolating myself slightly from the main board space, but I keep the whole center of the board open for movement. If I move RIGHT, I am more centralized.\n\nSince the goal is to safely secure the apple, and both paths are equally fast and safe, I'll choose DOWN to get into the apple's row (y=2) immediately, which simplifies future pathing by prioritizing the Y alignment.\n\nLong-term plan:\nT7: Move DOWN to (1, 2). Target (4, 2).\nT8: Move RIGHT towards (2, 2).\nT9: Move RIGHT towards (3, 2).\nT10: Move RIGHT to (4, 2) and eat.\n\nDOWN",

Post-(6,0) eat, head to (4,2) or (9,0) depending on enemy path; use length advantage (3+ apples vs. 1) to block/control. Avoid col1, stay low/right for openness; if trapped, loop up to row2 apples but only if safe.\n\nRIGHT",

D = |7-4| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nClosest apple is A1 at (6, 2) (D=2). This apple is attainable by moving RIGHT twice.\n\n2. Determine Safe Moves from (4, 2):\nPossible moves: (4, 3) UP, (4, 1) DOWN, (3, 2) LEFT, (5, 2) RIGHT.\n\n*   UP to (4, 3): Safe. D to (6, 2) is 3.\n*   DOWN to (4, 1):\n    *   Target is (4, 1). Enemy Head is at (4, 0).\n    *   If Enemy moves UP to (4, 1), we have a head-on collision. **UNSAFE/HIGH RISK.**\n    *   If Enemy moves LEFT to (3, 0) (backwards), RIGHT to (5, 0), or DOWN (off board), then (4, 1) is safe.\n    *   Since (4, 0) and (4, 2) are vertically aligned, moving DOWN into (4, 1) is extremely dangerous because the enemy's most likely move is RIGHT to (5, 0) or UP to (4, 1) if they target apples on Y>0.\n\n*   LEFT to (3, 2): Hitting body segment (3, 2). **UNSAFE (moving backwards).**\n*   RIGHT to (5, 2): Safe. D to (6, 2) is 1. **Prime Move.**\n\nSafe moves are UP (4, 3) and RIGHT (5, 2). RIGHT is optimal as it moves closer to the closest apple (6, 2).\n\n3.

This apple is attainable by moving RIGHT twice.\n\nPossible enemy moves from (4, 0):\n*   UP to (4, 1): Moves towards me (I could be at (4, 2) or moving to (4, 3) if I moved UP). This also moves them toward A1 (6, 2) and A5 (7, 5).\n*   DOWN to (4, -1): Off board. UNSAFE.\n*   LEFT to (3, 0): Hitting body segment (3, 0). UNSAFE (moving backwards).\n*   RIGHT to (5, 0): Safe. Moves directly towards (6, 0). **Most likely strategic move.**\n\n4. Collision Risk Assessment (Selecting RIGHT to (5, 2)):\nMy target: (5, 2).\n\n*   If Enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 0): Safe. I will be at (5, 2), Enemy at (5, 0). Safe distance.\n*   If Enemy moves UP to (4, 1): Safe. I will be at (5, 2), Enemy at (4, 1). Safe distance.\n\nThe move RIGHT is secure.\n\n5. Strategy Confirmation:\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 2) puts me one step away from the apple at (6, 2).\n\nLong-term plan:\nT11: Move RIGHT to (5, 2). Head (5, 2).\nT12: Move RIGHT to (6, 2) and EAT. Length 4. Head (6, 2).\nT13+: Target either (6, 0) (D=2 from (6, 2)) or (7, 5) (D=5 from (6, 2)). (6, 0) might be contested by the enemy.\n\nI will move RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Given the equal distance to (8, 0) and (6, 1) (both D=1) for the enemy from (6, 0), and that (8, 0) is an apple 2 steps away (via (7, 0)), and (6, 1) is an open space, RIGHT (7, 0) is still the most likely enemy move. But moving into (6, 1) is still dangerous due to the possibility of a head-on collision.\n\n*   **Move 2: UP to (6, 3)**\n    *   This moves me away from the enemy snake on Y-axis.\n    *   If I move UP, I am positioned well to pursue (7, 5) or potentially (3, 7)/(3, 8) later.\n    *   This is a safe and defensive move, while still progressing toward A3 (7, 5).\n\n*   **Move 3: RIGHT to (7, 2)**\n    *   This is an offensive move, progressing toward A2 (8, 0) and A3 (7, 5).\n    *   Enemy snake moving to (7, 0) is 2 distance steps away from (7, 2). No immediate head-on risk.\n    *   If I move RIGHT, I am equidistant (D=3) to both A2 and A3.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision:**\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe.\n\n1.  **RIGHT (7, 2):** Good for attacking both A2 (8, 0) and A3 (7, 5). Positions me one step closer to the right side of the board where most nearby apples are.\n    *   If the enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 0), they are advancing toward A2 (8, 0) and A1 (9, 0). I can continue moving UP/RIGHT towards A3 (7, 5).\n    *   If I aim for A3 (7, 5), my next move from (7, 2) would likely be UP to (7, 3), then to (7, 4) or (8, 4), which seems less optimal than pursuing (7, 5) directly. Wait, from (7, 2), I need 3 more UP moves to reach (7, 5).\n\n2.  **UP (6, 3):** Good for attacking A3 (7, 5). Highly safe.\n    *   From (6, 3), I need to move RIGHT to (7, 3), then UP twice to (7, 5).\n\nSince the enemy is likely to sweep the bottom right corner (A2, A1) by moving RIGHT, it is best for me to prioritize the less contested apple, A3 (7, 5), which is located higher up. Moving UP to (6, 3) provides safety and directs me toward A3.\n\nLet's compare the path to A3 (7, 5):\nStarting (6, 2).\nPath A (Using UP): (6, 3) -> (7, 3) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 5). (4 steps)\nPath B (Using RIGHT): (7, 2) -> (7, 3) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 5). (4 steps)\n\nBoth take the same number of steps. UP (6, 3) is slightly safer as it quickly increases vertical distance from the enemy snake, who is confined to the bottom row for now.\n\nLet's choose UP.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove UP to (6, 3) to increase distance from Enemy 0 and position for A3 (7, 5). Next turn, I will likely try to move RIGHT to (7, 3) to continue pursuing A3.\n\nUP",

The board state shows that Snake 0 moved from (6, 0) to (7, 0). Snake 0 did not eat an apple, as its length is still 5 and the apple count is 4. This confirms the enemy moved RIGHT along the bottom edge.\n\n**1. Locate Apples and Calculate Distances (Manhattan Distance D) from My Head (6, 3):**\n\n*   A1: (9, 0).

Enemy Body: (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0).\n    *   UP (6, 4): Safe.\n    *   LEFT (5, 3): Safe.\n    *   RIGHT (7, 3): Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP (6, 4), LEFT (5, 3), RIGHT (7, 3).\n\n**3. Analyze Safe Moves in Relation to Apples and Enemy Position (7, 0):**\n\nEnemy Head (7, 0). Enemy's safe moves:\n*   (7, 1) UP: Moves towards A3 (7, 5).\n*   (8, 0) RIGHT: Moves onto A2 (8, 0). **Highly likely, as it's an apple.** (Length 5 -> 6, Score 4 -> 5)\n*   (6, 0) LEFT: Moves onto their own body segment (6, 0). **UNSAFE (or potentially safe if they move immediately onto their tail, but here (6, 0) is their second segment). Unsafe.**\n\nEnemy is almost certainly moving to (8, 0) and eating A2.\n\nMy target is A3 (7, 5), D=3.\n\n*   **Move 1: UP to (6, 4)**\n    *   D to (7, 5) = |7-6| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n    *   Next move options: (7, 4) RIGHT or (6, 5) UP.\n    *   If I move UP, I stay far from the enemy.\n\n*   **Move 2: RIGHT to (7, 3)**\n    *   D to (7, 5) = |7-7| + |5-3| = 0 + 2 = 2.\n    *   This move points directly towards A3 (7, 5). Next move would be UP to (7, 4) or UP to (7, 5).\n    *   This move takes my snake into the x=7 column, which is the column the enemy is starting to sweep up. However, the enemy is only at y=0, pursuing apples at y=0. (7, 3) is very safe from current enemy position.\n\n*   **Move 3: LEFT to (5, 3)**\n    *   D to (7, 5) = |7-5| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4. (Moves away from the target.)\n    *   This moves me towards A4/A5 which are far away. Less optimal.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision - Choosing between UP and RIGHT:**\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT lead to A3 (7, 5) in 2 distance units.\n\nPath A (RIGHT): (7, 3) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 5) (Eat A3). (3 steps total including current move)\nPath B (UP): (6, 4) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 5) (Eat A3). (3 steps total including current move)\n\n*   **RIGHT (7, 3):** Gets me into the target column immediately. This prepares me for a vertical ascent toward (7, 5). If the enemy moves to (8, 0), they are still several steps away from interfering with my climb.\n*   **UP (6, 4):** Keeps me in the center column (x=6) and maintains maximum distance from the enemy, but requires a later diagonal move (RIGHT).\n\nSince the paths take the same number of steps, I should pick the one that is most direct AND safest. Moving RIGHT to (7, 3) is very direct toward the (7, 5) target, and since the enemy is focused on the bottom right corner (A2, A1), this area is low risk.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 3), my body remains at (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2) + new segment (6, 3).\nIf the enemy moves to (8, 0) (eats A2), their head is at (8, 0). They are 3 steps away from my new head position (7, 3) and cannot interfere next turn.\n\nChoosing RIGHT to capitalize on the direct route to A3 while the enemy is preoccupied with the corner apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy Body: [(7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0)].\n    *   UP (7, 4): Safe.\n    *   DOWN (7, 2): Safe.\n    *   RIGHT (8, 3): Safe. (Far from (8, 0))\n\nSafe moves: UP (7, 4), DOWN (7, 2), RIGHT (8, 3).\n\n**3. Analyze Safe Moves in Relation to Target (7, 5):**\n\nTarget: (7, 5). D=2.\n\n*   **Move 1: UP to (7, 4)**\n    *   D to (7, 5) = 1. This is the direct path to the target. I will reach (7, 5) next turn. **Optimal Apple Seeking Move.**\n*   **Move 2: DOWN to (7, 2)**\n    *   D to (7, 5) = 3. Moves away from the target. Less optimal.\n*   **Move 3: RIGHT to (8, 3)**\n    *   D to (7, 5) = |7-8| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3. Moves slightly away from the target, but potentially keeps options open toward (9, 0) or if the enemy moves up.\n\n**4.

Collision Check:**\n\n*   If I move UP to (7, 4) and Enemy moves RIGHT to (9, 0), there is no collision risk. I will be far from the enemy.\n\n**6. Conclusion:**\n\nMoving UP to (7, 4) is the direct, safe, and optimal move to capture the closest apple (7, 5) on the next turn.\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\nAfter eating (7, 5) next turn, assess the board state. The enemy (ID 0) is dominating the bottom right corner (x=8, x=9). I should look towards the central/upper board apples (3, 8), (3, 7), (6, 8). The apple (6, 8) is the next closest at D=6 (from (7, 5)).\n\nUP",

Moves closer.\n*   **Move 2: LEFT to (6, 5)**\n    *   D to (6, 8): |6-6| + |8-5| = 0 + 3 = 3. Moves closer.\n*   **Move 3: RIGHT to (8, 5)**\n    *   D to (6, 8): |6-8| + |8-5| = 2 + 3 = 5. Moves away.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT move me closer to the primary target (6, 8). LEFT seems slightly better as it moves horizontally towards the target's X-coordinate (6).\n\nLet's check alternative close apples: (3, 7) D=6, (5, 9) D=6.\n*   If I move LEFT to (6, 5):\n    *   (6, 8) D=3\n    *   (3, 7) D=|3-6| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5 (Closer to this target too).\n*   If I move UP to (7, 6):\n    *   (6, 8) D=3\n    *   (3, 7) D=|3-7| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are excellent moves strategically. LEFT (6, 5) puts me in a more central column, potentially giving better access to multiple apples.\n\n**4. Enemy Movement Prediction (Head 9, 1):**\nEnemy (9, 1) is currently far from all apples (Closest A5 (5, 9) D=4+8=12, A3 (6, 8) D=3+7=10). Wait, let me re-calculate D for Enemy (9, 1).\n\n*   A3 (6, 8): D = |6-9| + |8-1| = 3 + 7 = 10.\n*   A4 (5, 9): D = |5-9| + |9-1| = 4 + 8 = 12.\n*   A2 (3, 7): D = |3-9| + |7-1| = 6 + 6 = 12.\n*   A5 (2, 2): D = |2-9| + |2-1| = 7 + 1 = 8. **(Enemy's closest apple)**\n\nEnemy is likely to aim for (2, 2) D=8.\nSafe moves for Enemy (9, 1):\n1. UP to (9, 2): Safe. D to (2, 2) = 9. Moves away from Y=1 line.\n2. LEFT to (8, 1): Safe. D to (2, 2) = 7. Moves closer.\n3. DOWN to (9, 0): Backwards into their body segment (9, 0). **FATAL.**\n4. RIGHT to (10, 1): Off board. **FATAL.**\n\nEnemy must move LEFT to (8, 1) to approach (2, 2), or UP to (9, 2) to get away from the wall. LEFT is the optimal move for the enemy to pursue the closest apple (2, 2).\n\n**5. Collision Check:**\nMy potential moves are (7, 6), (6, 5), (8, 5).\nEnemy potential move is (8, 1) or (9, 2).\nCollision risk is extremely low. We are currently quite far apart, and the enemy is focused on the bottom left corner while I am focusing on the top center.\n\n**6. Final Decision: Choosing between UP and LEFT.**\n\nBoth move me closer to (6, 8) D=4.\n*   If I move UP to (7, 6): I retain the central column X=7.\n*   If I move LEFT to (6, 5): I move into X=6. This is directly below the X=6 target line.\n\nMoving LEFT to (6, 5) seems more efficient for navigating towards (6, 8). I will then likely move UP.\n\nPath LEFT: (7, 5) -> (6, 5) -> (6, 6) or (7, 6)?\nIf (6, 5), next options: UP (6, 6) D=2, DOWN (6, 4), LEFT (5, 5), RIGHT (7, 5) (Body). UP is preferred.\nIf (6, 5) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7) -> (6, 8) (Eat) Length 3 moves.\n\nPath UP: (7, 5) -> (7, 6) -> (6, 6) D=2 or (7, 7) D=3.\nIf (7, 6), next options: UP (7, 7) D=3, DOWN (7, 5) (Body), LEFT (6, 6) D=2, RIGHT (8, 6). LEFT is preferred.\nIf (7, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (6, 7) -> (6, 8) (Eat). Length 3 moves.\n\nBoth paths take 3 more moves to reach (6, 8). I will choose LEFT as it gives me better positioning relative to my target's X-coordinate immediately.\n\nLEFT\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nTarget the apple at (6, 8) next. My move to (6, 5) positions me well. Next move should be UP to (6, 6) to continue ascending toward the apple cluster while maintaining board flexibility.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nLEFT",

Monitor enemy (likely up to (7,6+), target (6,8)); if they go left/top, flank via (3,8)/(3,7) using length to block mid-board. Free bottom as tail pulls up; avoid (2,2) unless enemy clears path.

Prefer UP: maintains right-edge buffer (low collision risk vs. enemy at col 6-7), builds y-coordinate for top access (next UP to (9,5) empty, then LEFT to (8,5) empty; 2-3 moves to y=6). LEFT risks crowding near enemy tail (their DOWN/LEFT could expand col 7-8), limits immediate follow-ups (UP from (8,3) to (8,4) ok, but DOWN to (8,2) less strategic). Enemy likely claims (6,8) next turn (UP to (6,7), then (6,8); grow to 5), so position to contest (5,9) or (3,8) without direct path cross. No immediate dangers; (2,2) apple remains distant option if top crowded.\n\n### Long-Term Plan\nContinue edge ascent: UP to (9,4), then UP to (9,5) next turn (tail clears to (8,0); y=5 positions for LEFT pivot across row 5 (cols 9-8 empty, skirt enemy col 7 by going col 6+ if needed) toward (5,9)/(6,8) by turn 22 (+1 to 7). If enemy eats (6,8), flank to (3,8)/(3,7) via row 7-8 leftward (open path cols 9-3). Monitor for (2,2) if top blocked, but prioritize high-yield top contest (lead 6-4; aim 8-5 by turn 30 via respawns). Use length to block if enemy pursues right.\n\nUP",

They are equidistant. Given the enemy's current position (9, 4), they are starting to move up the right wall, which favors them going for top apples.\n\nEnemy safe moves from (9, 4):\n1.

Determine Safe Moves from (6, 8):**\nPossible moves: (6, 9) UP, (6, 7) DOWN, (5, 8) LEFT, (7, 8) RIGHT.\n\n*   **Boundary Checks:** All 4 moves are within board limits.\n*   **Self-Collision Checks:**\n    *   DOWN to (6, 7): This is the cell directly behind the head (my body segment). **UNSAFE (moving backwards).**\n*   **Enemy Body/Head Collision Checks:**\n    *   Enemy Head: (9, 5). Enemy body segments are (9, 4) down to (8, 0).\n    *   No immediate collision threat with enemy body segments.\n\nSafe moves: UP (6, 9), LEFT (5, 8), RIGHT (7, 8).\n\n**3. Analyze Safe Moves in Relation to Target (5, 9) (D=2):**\n\n*   **Move 1: UP to (6, 9)**\n    *   D to (5, 9): |6-5| + |9-9| = 1 + 0 = 1. Moves closer to the target. Best path is LEFT then UP, or UP then LEFT. This saves the UP direction for next turn, but still moves toward the target corner.\n*   **Move 2: LEFT to (5, 8)**\n    *   D to (5, 9): |5-5| + |9-8| = 0 + 1 = 1. Moves closer to the target. This is the optimal approach move.\n*   **Move 3: RIGHT to (7, 8)**\n    *   D to (5, 9): |7-5| + |9-8| = 2 + 1 = 3. Moves away from the target.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT yield a distance of 1 to (5, 9). However, moving LEFT to (5, 8) aligns perfectly for an UP move next turn to capture (5, 9).\n\nLet's check alternative apples:\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 8):\nD to (3, 8): D=2 (LEFT, LEFT)\nD to (8, 7): D=3 (RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN)\n\nIf I move UP to (6, 9):\nD to (3, 8): D=4 (LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN)\nD to (8, 7): D=3 (RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN)\n\nMoving LEFT seems strategically more effective as it sets up for the immediate apple (5, 9) and keeps options open for (3, 8) afterward.\n\n**4. Enemy Movement Prediction (Head 9, 5):**\nEnemy (ID 0) is at (9, 5), adjacent to the top wall and far right.\nClosest apples for Enemy 0 are (5, 9) (D = |5-9| + |9-5| = 4 + 4 = 8) and (8, 7) (D = |8-9| + |7-5| = 1 + 2 = 3).\nThe enemy is much closer to (8, 7) (D=3) than to (5, 9) (D=8).\n\nEnemy safe moves from (9, 5):\n1. UP to (9, 6): D to (8, 7) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n2. DOWN to (9, 4): This is now a body segment. **UNSAFE (moving backwards).**\n3. LEFT to (8, 5): D to (8, 7) = 0 + 2 = 2.\n4. RIGHT to (10, 5): Off board. **FATAL.**\n\nThe enemy will likely move UP (9, 6) or LEFT (8, 5) to target (8, 7).\nIf the enemy moves (8, 5), they are 2 steps away from (8, 7).\nIf the enemy moves (9, 6), they are 2 steps away from (8, 7).\n\n*Collision Check:*\nMy chosen move: LEFT to (5, 8).\nEnemy predicted moves: (9, 6) or (8, 5).\nOur paths are currently wide apart. No immediate head-on collision threat.\n\n**5. Detailed Analysis of LEFT (5, 8):**\nMoving to (5, 8) positions me directly below (5, 9). The move is safe.\nIf the enemy chooses (8, 5), they are heading for (8, 7), which is far from me.\nIf the enemy chooses (9, 6), they are also heading for (8, 7).\n\nBy moving LEFT, I secure the route to (5, 9) next turn. If I moved UP to (6, 9), I would have to move LEFT next turn, which is also fine. However, (5, 8) seems more direct towards the target coordinate.\n\nLet's confirm if moving LEFT sets up any immediate future danger. (5, 8) is an open square. My body is currently at (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4). The tail will release (7, 4) next turn. The position (5, 8) is safe and open.\n\n**6. Final Decision:**\nMove LEFT to position for capturing (5, 9) next turn.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\n1. Move LEFT to (5, 8).\n2. Move UP to (5, 9) (Apple capture).\n3. From (5, 9), the closest apples would be (3, 8) (D=2) and (3, 7) (D=3). I should prioritize (3, 8) by moving LEFT.\nThe enemy is likely challenging for (8, 7). If they succeed, they will seek other apples on the right side or top. I should secure the left-top quadrant.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nLEFT",

Avoid row 7 LEFT (enemy body lingers at (6,7) 4+ turns). Alt: if (3,8) contested, loop to (3,7) via row 8 DOWN at col 3 or south flank. Maintain lead (7-5 post-eat); use length to block cols 8-9.

Enemy is distant. No immediate collision concerns.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN (4, 8), LEFT (3, 9).\n\n**3. Analyze Safe Moves in Relation to Target (3, 8) (D=2):**\n\n*   **Move 1: DOWN to (4, 8)**\n    *   New D to (3, 8): |3-4| + |8-8| = 1 + 0 = 1. (Optimal progress)\n    *   Status: This move puts me directly adjacent to the target (3, 8), allowing capture next turn.\n*   **Move 2: LEFT to (3, 9)**\n    *   New D to (3, 8): |3-3| + |8-9| = 0 + 1 = 1. (Optimal progress)\n    *   Status: This move also puts me directly adjacent to the target (3, 8), allowing capture next turn.\n\nBoth moves lead to capturing (3, 8) on Turn 25. Now I must consider which move offers better maneuverability or defense.\n\n**Comparing (4, 8) vs (3, 9):**\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (4, 8):**\nNext turn (Turn 25) potential moves to capture (3, 8): LEFT.\nOther moves: UP (to 4, 9, which is my previous head location), DOWN (to 4, 7), RIGHT (to 5, 8, which is a body piece).\nThis path is slightly less flexible immediately after eating the apple, as (5, 8) is a body piece.\n\nIf I move **LEFT to (3, 9):**\nNext turn (Turn 25) potential moves to capture (3, 8): DOWN.\nOther moves: UP (Off board), LEFT (to 2, 9), RIGHT (to 4, 9, which is my previous head location).\nThis path keeps me along the top edge. If I move to (3, 8) (DOWN), the body segments are (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8)... securing the top left corner.\n\nLet's look ahead to the target after (3, 8), which is (3, 7) (D=3 total from (4, 9)).\n\nScenario A: Move DOWN to (4, 8). (Turn 24)\n*   T25: Move LEFT to (3, 8) (Eats apple). Head is now (3, 8).\n*   T26: Target (3, 7) is 1 unit away. Move DOWN to (3, 7) (Eats apple).\n\nScenario B: Move LEFT to (3, 9). (Turn 24)\n*   T25: Move DOWN to (3, 8) (Eats apple). Head is now (3, 8).\n*   T26: Target (3, 7) is 1 unit away. Move DOWN to (3, 7) (Eats apple).\n\nBoth paths achieve the next two apples equally quickly (3 moves total including this one). (4, 9) -> Apple 1 -> Apple 2.\n\nThe key differences are the cells I traverse:\nA: (4, 9) -> (4, 8) -> (3, 8) -> (3, 7)\nB: (4, 9) -> (3, 9) -> (3, 8) -> (3, 7)\n\nMoving LEFT (to B) keeps me against the safety of the top wall for one more turn, and creates a slightly safer exit path after eating the apples, as the path (3, 9) -> (3, 8) is a single, clear column descent which then keeps the snake pointed downwards towards lower targets like (2, 2). Moving to (4, 8) isolates the snake one row lower sooner, but still provides good access.\n\nGiven that both moves are equally optimal for immediate objective completion (3 moves total to get both apples), I'll choose LEFT (3, 9) as it maximizes peripheral board space utilization (against the wall) and prepares the snake neatly for the vertical drop to the subsequent apple (3, 7).\n\n**4. Enemy Movement Prediction (Head 8, 7):**\nEnemy 0 just ate (8, 7) (Length 8, Score 7).\nClosest apples to (8, 7):\n(3, 8): D = 5\n(3, 7): D = 5\n(6, 1): D = 8\n(8, 1): D = 6\n(2, 2): D = 11\n\nThe enemy is unlikely to impact my moves in the upper left over the next three turns. They will probably move:\n1. UP to (8, 8) or (7, 7) LEFT to move away from their curled tail.\n2. The safest opening for Enemy 0 from (8, 7) is usually UP to (8, 8) or potentially RIGHT to (9, 7) (which is a body segment and therefore backwards, unsafe). Wait, (9, 7) is the first body segment, so RIGHT is unsafe.\nAvailable moves for Enemy 0 from (8, 7): UP (8, 8), DOWN (8, 6), LEFT (7, 7).\n*   UP (8, 8): D to (3, 8) is 5. Less congestion.\n*   DOWN (8, 6): D to (8, 1) is 5.\n*   LEFT (7, 7): D to (3, 7) is 4.\n\nEnemy 0 might choose LEFT to (7, 7) to start creeping toward my area, or DOWN to (8, 6) towards (8, 1). Since (7, 7) is closest to any available apple, I predict the enemy will move LEFT or DOWN. No matter their choice, my move LEFT to (3, 9) keeps me safe and optimized.\n\n**5. Final Decision:**\nMove LEFT to (3, 9).\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\n1. T24: Move LEFT to (3, 9).\n2. T25: Move DOWN to (3, 8) (Eat A1).\n3. T26: Move DOWN to (3, 7) (Eat A2).\n4. T27: Head towards (2, 2). I will be at (3, 7) and need to move LEFT (2, 7), then DOWN to (2, 2).\nTarget the left side of the board completely before dealing with the bottom right section, where the enemy is stronger.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nLEFT",

Prefer UP: aligns with prior plan to control top-right/row8, approaches (3,8) safely (5-6 turns via LEFTs + skirt), keeps 8-6 lead by contesting top apples before enemy (they need 2+ turns to threaten). DOWN/LEFT risk enemy scoring 2 apples to tie/surpass while I chase bottom (8,1). Maintains multiple follow-ups: from (8,8), LEFT/RIGHT/UP open.\n\n### Long-Term Plan\nUP to (8,8) (secure row8). Turn 25: LEFT to (7,8) empty (advance west). Turn 26: Assess enemy (likely DOWN/LEFT chasing (3,8)); if (6,8) still occupied (~3 more turns), DOWN to (7,7) empty. Turn 27: LEFT to (6,7) (vacates ~turn 27 as tail progresses). Turn 28: UP to (6,8) or LEFT to (5,8) (post-vacation; (5,8) vacates earlier ~turn 26). Turn 29: Path to (3,8) (cols 4-3 row8 empty; eat for 8 apples, length 9). If enemy takes (3,8), pivot to (3,7) DOWN. Post-8 lead, block enemy bottom expansion (col6+); target (8,1) ~turn 35 circling tail. Avoid (2,2)/(6,1) mid-board traps. Aim 11 apples by turn 50, trap enemy by 100.\n\nUP",

Enemy head: (3,9), full: [(3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6)] (length 7). Apples: (3,8)/(3,7) directly accessible to enemy (likely DOWN to eat (3,8) this turn, then (3,7) next, reaching 8 apples, length 9 by end turn 26, blocking cols 3-6 rows 6-9). Other apples distant; (8,1) viable for me (manhattan 7, achievable in 9 turns with detour). No adjacent apples.\n\n- **UP**: To (8,9) \u2014 empty. No growth. New positions: [(8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3)] (tail (9,2) removed, length 8). Safe (no overlap/collision risks; enemy can't reach row9 col8). But edges top; follow-ups (LEFT to (7,9) or RIGHT (9,9)) delay descent to bottom apples by 2+ turns vs. direct path, ceding initiative as enemy scores twice unopposed.\n- **DOWN**: To (8,7) \u2014 own body (neck). Death. Invalid.\n- **LEFT**: To (7,8) \u2014 empty. No growth. New positions: [(7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3)] (tail (9,2) removed, length 8). Safe (no overlap; enemy far left/top, can't collide with (7,8)). Advances toward detour around own block/self + enemy territory; sets up DOWN to col7 (open entire column) for path to (8,1). Maintains lead potential by reaching apple ~turn 33 (me to 8) after enemy hits 8 (~turn 26), then chase (6,1) ~turn 35 (to 9 before enemy ~turn 37).\n- **RIGHT**: To (9,8) \u2014 empty. No growth. New positions: [(9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3)] (length 8). Safe, but traps options: next moves limited (only UP viable; LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT death into self/off-board). Diverts from apples, wastes turns in top-right corner while enemy surges to 8.\n\nAll safe moves (UP/LEFT/RIGHT) avoid immediate death/head-on (enemy likely DOWN to (3,8), distant from my options). Prefer LEFT: maximizes future flexibility (col7 down fully open, no self-blocks after initial shift; vacates (8,7) by ~turn 31), targets reachable apple sooner than alternatives, denies enemy easy bottom access post-their (2,2) chase. UP/RIGHT reduce mobility/trap risk without apple progress, allowing enemy 3-4 unopposed eats (to 9-10 by turn 32).\n\n### Long-Term Plan\nLEFT to (7,8) (detour start). Turns 26-32: DOWN x7 to (7,1) (col7 clear; body shifts safely, no self-hits; vacates top by ~31). Turn 33: RIGHT to (8,1) eat (apples 8, length 9; body col7 rows 1-8). Turn 34: RIGHT to (9,1) (open bottom-right, avoids self at (7,1); keeps south/east options). Turn 35: LEFT to (8,1) vacated? Or UP to (9,2) if new apple south\u2014prioritize new apple (appears on eat, assume empty spot); if near bottom, target (6,1) but check self (likely clear post-growth/shift). Enemy: assume (3,8) t25/(3,7) t26/(2,2) t32 (to 9); block their bottom pivot ~t37 by controlling cols 7-9 rows 0-3, force mid-board risks. If enemy deviates (e.g., skips top for (2,2) now ~8 turns), pivot to (3,7) if free (unlikely). Post-9, circle bottom-right for new spawns; aim 12+ by t50, trap enemy in left by t100 via length advantage.\n\nLEFT",

FATAL.\n\nIf the enemy moves LEFT (6, 8), they will be 3 steps away from (3, 7). Since I am moving to (3, 7) this turn, I already secure it. The enemy is still too far to contest the next likely target (2, 2) this turn, but I must remain mindful of their location.\n\n**5. Long-Term Strategy Check:**\n1. T26 (Current): Move DOWN to (3, 7) (Eat A1). New Head (3, 7).\n2. T27: Next apple is (2, 2). I need to move LEFT and then DOWN. Possible safe paths:\n    *   (3, 7) -> (2, 7) LEFT. D to (2, 2) = 5.\n    *   (3, 7) -> (3, 6) DOWN. D to (2, 2) = 1 + 4 = 5.\n\nCurrently, moving LEFT makes more sense as it aligns the X-coordinate.\n\nT27 Plan: Move LEFT to (2, 7) towards (2, 2).\nT28 Plan: Move DOWN to (2, 6).\nT29 Plan: Move DOWN to (2, 5).\n...\nT32/33: Arrive at (2, 2) to eat the apple.\n\nThe plan to secure the immediate apples and then proceed to (2, 2) is sound.\n\n**6. Final Decision:**\nMove DOWN to capture the apple at (3, 7).\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\n1. T26 (Current): Move DOWN to (3, 7) (Eat A1). New Head (3, 7).\n2. T27: Move LEFT to (2, 7) to start approaching (2, 2).\n3. T28: Move DOWN to (2, 6).\n4. T29: Move DOWN to (2, 5).\nContinue path towards (2, 2), while monitoring Enemy 0's movements in the central/right area.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",

Enemy head: (3,8), full: [(3,8), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6)] (length 8). Apples: (3,7) adjacent to enemy (likely DOWN to eat, growing to length 9/apples 8; then path to (2,2) ~6 turns, reaching ~turn 32). (8,1) still viable for me (manhattan 7 from (7,8), but DOWN starts direct descent col7). No adjacent apples for me.\n\n- **UP**: To (7,9) \u2014 empty. No growth. New positions: [(7,9), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4)] (tail (9,3) drops, length 8). Safe (empty, no enemy reach in 1 turn; top row open). But diverts upward, adds 2 turns to reach bottom apples vs. direct DOWN path; risks enemy uncontested growth to 9+ while I loop back.\n- **DOWN**: To (7,7) \u2014 empty. No growth. New positions: [(7,7), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4)] (tail (9,3) drops, length 8). Safe (no overlap/collision; enemy can't reach col7 row7 this turn). Aligns with plan: col7 fully open downward (rows 0-6 col7 empty, no self/enemy blocks); advances to (7,1) in 6 more turns, then RIGHT to (8,1) eat ~turn 33 (my apples 8, length 9). Positions me to contest bottom (6,1)/(5,0) before enemy pivots south ~turn 35+.\n- **LEFT**: To (6,8) \u2014 enemy body. Death. Invalid.\n- **RIGHT**: To (8,8) \u2014 own body (backwards into neck). Death. Invalid.\n\nBoth safe moves (UP/DOWN) avoid death/head-on (enemy likely DOWN to (3,7), distant from col7). Prefer DOWN: progresses toward (8,1)/(6,1) without detour, keeps col7 escape/maneuverability (body shifts rightward minimally, clears top by turn 30); enables lead regain (me to 8 ~t33, enemy to 9 ~t32, but I block their bottom access via length/position). UP stalls progress, allows enemy 1-2 extra uncontested apples.\n\n### Long-Term Plan\nContinue DOWN to (7,7). Turns 27-32: DOWN x6 to (7,1) (col7 clear; tail follows to col8-9 mid, no self-hits; full vacate of rows 7+ by ~t32). Turn 33: RIGHT to (8,1) eat (apples 8, grow length 9; body fills col7 rows1-8). Turn 34: RIGHT to (9,1) or DOWN to (8,0) if new apple spawns south\u2014prioritize (5,0) or (6,1) next (~3-4 turns, to apples 9-10 by t37). Turn 35+: LEFT/UP to (6,1) if free, or patrol bottom-right for spawns; use length to wall off cols 7-9 rows 0-2, trap enemy mid-board when they chase (2,2) then south. If enemy skips (3,7) for faster bottom (unlikely, ~9 turns to (8,1) vs. my 7), intercept at (6,1) by t34 via LEFT from (7,1). Aim 12 apples by t50, force enemy risks left/center.\n\nDOWN",

(Best target for enemy)\n(8, 1): D = |8-7| + |1-7| = 1 + 6 = 7. (Also tied for best)\n(5, 0): D = |5-7| + |0-7| = 2 + 7 = 9.\n(8, 4): D = |8-7| + |4-7| = 1 + 3 = 4. (Closest apple for enemy!)\n\nThe enemy's closest apple is (8, 4), D=4.\nPossible safe moves for Enemy 0 from (7, 7):\n* UP (7, 8): Enemy body segment (behind head). FATAL. No.\n* DOWN (7, 6): Safe. D to (8, 4) = 1 + 2 = 3.\n* LEFT (6, 7): Safe. D to (8, 4) = 2 + 3 = 5.\n* RIGHT (8, 7): Enemy body segment. FATAL. No.\n\nThe enemy must choose DOWN (7, 6) or LEFT (6, 7). Moving DOWN towards (7, 6) is the most direct path to (8, 4) (via 8, 5 or 8, 6).\n\nPredicted Enemy move: DOWN to (7, 6) or possibly towards (6, 1) or (8, 1) which are D=7, perhaps via (6, 7) or (7, 6). Given that (8, 4) is D=4, they should prioritize that one. We assume they move towards (8, 4).\n\nIn any case, the enemy is fully occupied on the East side of the board and poses no threat to my current path in the West.\n\n**5.

T30: Move DOWN to (2, 4). D to (2, 2) = 2.\n5. T31: Move DOWN to (2, 3). D to (2, 2) = 1.\n6. T32: Move DOWN to (2, 2) (Eat A1).\n\nThis path is clear and safe.\n\n**6. Final Decision:**\nMove LEFT.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\n1. T27 (Current): Move LEFT to (2, 7). New Head (2, 7).\n2. T28: Move DOWN to (2, 6).\n3. T29: Move DOWN to (2, 5).\n4. T30: Move DOWN to (2, 4).\n5. T31: Move DOWN to (2, 3).\n6. T32: Move DOWN to (2, 2) (Eat A1).\nAfter (2, 2), the next closest apples are (6, 1), (5, 0), and (8, 4) (if Enemy 0 hasn't taken it).

Long-Term Strategy refinement:**\nWe choose RIGHT to (3, 2) to open up the path towards (5, 0).\n\n**6. Safety Check (Avoiding Traps):**\nMoving right brings us into slightly more open space. Moving down to (2, 1) also keeps us open. Both moves are equally safe and efficient. Choosing RIGHT for better horizontal alignment to (5, 0).\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\n1.

Score: 9.\nBody segments (head-to-tail): (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9).\n\nEnemy Snake (ID 0):\nHead: (8, 1). Length: 10. Score: 9. (Enemy must have eaten an apple at (8, 1) or moved into it, which was an apple in T33. Given the new length of 10 and the new head position (8, 1), they definitively ate an apple there.)\nBody segments: (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (8, 8).\n\nApples current locations (A):\nA1: (6, 1)\nA2: (5, 0)\nA3: (2, 9) (Top corner, near my current tail)\nA4: (6, 0)\nA5: (9, 9)\n\nNote: Apple (8, 1) from T33 is gone, and T34 lists new apples. This means the list of 5 apples has been updated for T34.\n\n**1. Locate Target Apple and Calculate Distance (Manhattan Distance D) from My Head (3, 2):**\nMy goal is efficiency and safety. The enemy is currently far on the right side of the board (x=8, y=1). I should continue towards the lower left/middle apples.\n\nA1 (6, 1). D = |6-3| + |1-2| = 3 + 1 = 4.\nA2 (5, 0). D = |5-3| + |0-2| = 2 + 2 = 4. (Previously favored target)\nA3 (2, 9). D = |2-3| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8.\nA4 (6, 0). D = |6-3| + |0-2| = 3 + 2 = 5.\nA5 (9, 9). D = |9-3| + |9-2| = 6 + 7 = 13.\n\nTargets A1 (6, 1) and A2 (5, 0) are the closest (D=4). A2 (5, 0) seems slightly safer as it keeps me lower and away from A1 (6, 1) which is slightly closer to the enemy's recent territory. I'll maintain A2 (5, 0) as the primary target.\n\n**2. Determine Safe Moves from (3, 2):**\nPossible moves: (3, 3) UP, (3, 1) DOWN, (2, 2) LEFT, (4, 2) RIGHT.\n\n*   **Boundary Checks:** All moves are within bounds.\n*   **Self-Collision Checks (My body includes (2, 2)):**\n    *   LEFT to (2, 2): This is the immediate cell behind my head/neck. **FATAL (Moving backward).**\n*   **Enemy Collision Checks (Enemy 0 Head at (8, 1)):**\n    *   Enemy body segments: (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (8, 8).\n    *   No immediate enemy body segment collision for the safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).\n\nSafe moves: UP (3, 3), DOWN (3, 1), RIGHT (4, 2).\n\n**3. Analyze Safe Moves in Relation to Target (5, 0) (D=4):**\n\n*   **Move 1: DOWN to (3, 1)**\n    *   New D to (5, 0): |5-3| + |0-1| = 2 + 1 = 3. (Excellent progress towards vertical and maintaining horizontal position).\n\n*   **Move 2: RIGHT to (4, 2)**\n    *   New D to (5, 0): |5-4| + |0-2| = 1 + 2 = 3. (Excellent progress towards horizontal and maintaining vertical position).\n\n*   **Move 3: UP to (3, 3)**\n    *   New D to (5, 0): |5-3| + |0-3| = 2 + 3 = 5. (Increases distance). Avoid unless necessary for routing/safety.\n\n(3, 1) DOWN and (4, 2) RIGHT are equally efficient ways to reduce distance to D=3.\n\nConsidering the path:\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 2): Next move *could* be RIGHT to (5, 2) (D=2, then DOWN to (5, 1) D=1, then DOWN to (5, 0) D=0).\nIf I go DOWN to (3, 1): Next move *could* be RIGHT to (4, 1) (D=2, then RIGHT to (5, 1) D=1, then DOWN to (5, 0) D=0).\n\nBoth paths look viable and safe.\n\n**4. Safety Check and Tiebreaker:**\n\nThe board space around (3, 1) and (4, 2) is open.\nIf I choose DOWN to (3, 1), I get closer to the edge, which can sometimes be limiting, but here it is the edge where the apple is located.\nIf I choose RIGHT to (4, 2), I stay off the bottom edge for one more turn.\n\nLet's check for proximity to other apples. A1 (6, 1) is also D=4 away from my current position.\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 2): I am one step closer to A2 (5, 0) and approximately the same distance to A1 (6, 1) (D=|6-4|+|1-2|=2+1=3).\nIf I move DOWN to (3, 1): I am one step closer to A2 (5, 0) and slightly farther from A1 (6, 1) (D=|6-3|+|1-1|=3+0=3).\n\nBoth moves bring me to D=3 for both closest apples (5, 0) and (6, 1).\n\nSince (5, 0) is my primary target and it is on the bottom edge, moving DOWN to (3, 1) maximizes my proximity to the low Y-coordinate of the target while still allowing me to move RIGHT easily next turn toward X=5.\n\nPath (3, 2) -> (3, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 0).\nThis path is efficient and safe.\n\n**5. Enemy Prediction:**\nEnemy 0 is at (8, 1). They just ate an apple there. They are now 10 segments long.\nPossible moves for E0: UP to (8, 2) (moving backward, fatal), DOWN to (8, 0), LEFT to (7, 1), RIGHT to (9, 1).\nIf E0 goes DOWN to (8, 0): D to (6, 0) is |6-8|+|0-0|=2. Likely E0 target is (6, 0) or potentially (6, 1).\nIf E0 goes LEFT to (7, 1): D to (6, 1) is 1, D to (6, 0) is 2. (6, 1) is a strong candidate for E0.\n\nIf E0 aims for (6, 1) (D=1 from (7, 1)) or (6, 0) (D=2 from (8, 0)), my path towards (5, 0) (moving to (3, 1)) seems safe as it stays far away from X=6, 7, 8.\n\nI choose DOWN.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\n1. T34 (Current): Move DOWN to (3, 1). D to (5, 0) is 3. This sets up for a quick reach of (5, 0).\n2. T35: From (3, 1), move RIGHT to (4, 1). D to (5, 0) is 2.\n3. T36: From (4, 1), move RIGHT to (5, 1). D to (5, 0) is 1 (unless an apple appears at (5, 1) or is already there - unlikely).\n4.

Score: 9. (Enemy snake moved from (8, 1) to (7, 1). This was a LEFT movement, and since the segment (8, 1) was part of their body last turn if they didn't eat an apple, a move to (7, 1) is only possible if they *didn't* eat an apple at (8, 1) in T34, or if (8, 1) was the tail end of the body in T34, which it wasn't.)\n\nLet's re-examine the previous turn's state vs current state for Snake 0.\nT34 Head: (8, 1). T34 Body: [(8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (8, 8)]. Length 10.\nT35 Head: (7, 1). T35 Body: [(8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8)]. Length 10.\nSnake 0 moved LEFT from (8, 1) to (7, 1). Since their length remained 10, they did *not* eat an apple. Their body shifted one unit: (8, 8) was shed.\n\nApples current locations (A):\nA1: (6, 1)\nA2: (5, 0)\nA3: (2, 9)\nA4: (6, 0)\nA5: (9, 9)\n\n**1. Locate Target Apple and Calculate Distance (Manhattan Distance D) from My Head (3, 1):**\nI was aiming for A2 (5, 0).\n\nA1 (6, 1). D = |6-3| + |1-1| = 3 + 0 = 3.\nA2 (5, 0). D = |5-3| + |0-1| = 2 + 1 = 3. (Primary target remains A2)\nA3 (2, 9). D = |2-3| + |9-1| = 1 + 8 = 9.\nA4 (6, 0). D = |6-3| + |0-1| = 3 + 1 = 4.\nA5 (9, 9). D = |9-3| + |9-1| = 6 + 8 = 14.\n\nA1 (6, 1) and A2 (5, 0) are now equally close (D=3). Since A2 (5, 0) is safer concerning the enemy, I will prioritize it unless the path to A1 is critically better or A2 becomes dangerous.\n\n**2. Determine Safe Moves from (3, 1):**\nPossible moves: (3, 2) UP, (3, 0) DOWN, (2, 1) LEFT, (4, 1) RIGHT.\n\n*   **Boundary Checks:** All moves are within bounds (Y=0 is safe).\n*   **Self-Collision Checks (My body segments start at (3, 2)):**\n    *   UP to (3, 2): This is the immediate cell behind my head/neck. **FATAL (Moving backward).**\n*   **Enemy Collision Checks (Enemy 0 Head at (7, 1)):**\n    *   Enemy body segments: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8).\n    *   No immediate enemy body segment collision for the safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\nSafe moves: DOWN (3, 0), LEFT (2, 1), RIGHT (4, 1).\n\n**3. Analyze Safe Moves in Relation to Target (5, 0) (D=3):**\n\n*   **Move 1: RIGHT to (4, 1)**\n    *   New D to (5, 0): |5-4| + |0-1| = 1 + 1 = 2. (Reduces distance by 1. Excellent).\n    *   New D to (6, 1): |6-4| + |1-1| = 2 + 0 = 2. (Also reduces distance to A1 by 1. Note: This move brings me closer to the X=6 area where A1 and A4 are located.)\n\n*   **Move 2: DOWN to (3, 0)**\n    *   New D to (5, 0): |5-3| + |0-0| = 2 + 0 = 2. (Reduces distance by 1. Excellent).\n\n*   **Move 3: LEFT to (2, 1)**\n    *   New D to (5, 0): |5-2| + |0-1| = 3 + 1 = 4. (Increases distance by 1). Avoid.\n\nBoth RIGHT (4, 1) and DOWN (3, 0) are optimal in terms of distance reduction (D=2).\n\n**4. Safety Check and Tiebreaker (Collision Avoidance):**\n\nEnemy 0 Head is at (7, 1).\nPossible moves for E0: UP (7, 2), DOWN (7, 0), LEFT (6, 1) (Apple!), RIGHT (8, 1) (Body segment!).\n\nE0 will likely move toward the closest apples: (6, 1) (D=1) or (6, 0) (D=2).\n*   If E0 moves LEFT to **(6, 1)**, they eat A1. This is the most efficient move for E0.\n*   If E0 moves DOWN to (7, 0), they are preparing for (6, 0) or potentially still aiming for (6, 1).\n\n**Scenario 1: I move RIGHT to (4, 1).**\nIf E0 moves LEFT to (6, 1): We are safe. My next targets become (5, 0) (D=2) or (6, 0) (D=2).\nA move to (4, 1) puts me equidistant (D=2) from (5, 0) and (6, 0).\nIf E0 moves DOWN to (7, 0): We are safe.\nIf E0 moves UP to (7, 2): We are safe.\n\n**Scenario 2: I move DOWN to (3, 0).**\nIf E0 moves LEFT to (6, 1): We are safe. My next target would be (5, 0) (D=2). My position (3, 0) is well-aligned for a horizontal sweep.\nIf E0 moves DOWN to (7, 0): My position (3, 0) is adjacent to the path E0 is taking towards (6, 0) or (5, 0).\nFrom (3, 0), my path is R(4, 0) -> R(5, 0) (Apple).\nIf E0 goes (7, 1) -> (7, 0). Then (7, 0) -> (6, 0). This is a conflict zone for the (5, 0) apple.\n\nLet's prioritize the move that keeps me farther from the predicted conflict zone (X=6, Y=0/1). Given that the enemy is likely to move LEFT to (6, 1) and grab A1.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 1):\nMy path to A2 (5, 0): (4, 1) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 0). (2 turns remaining if I go UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT, 3 turns total).\nWait, from (4, 1):\nT36: DOWN to (4, 0). D=1.\nT37: RIGHT to (5, 0). EAT. (3 turns total: R, D, R)\n\nIf I move DOWN to (3, 0):\nMy path to A2 (5, 0): (3, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (5, 0). EAT. (2 turns total: R, R).\n\nMoving DOWN to (3, 0) is faster (2 moves vs 3 moves *if* I can make two horizontal moves).\n\nLet's recheck the fast path:\nT35: (3, 1) -> DOWN to (3, 0). D=2.\nT36: From (3, 0), move RIGHT to (4, 0). D=1. (This is safe, no self-collision, body is at Y>=1).\nT37: From (4, 0), move RIGHT to (5, 0). EAT! (This is safe).\n\nThis 2-move path (DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT) is much more efficient than the path starting RIGHT (RIGHT, DOWN, RIGHT or RIGHT, RIGHT, DOWN), assuming the goal is (5, 0).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (3, 0):\nEnemy prediction: E0 moves to (6, 1) (Eats A1).\nT36: I move RIGHT to (4, 0). E0 is now at e.g. (7, 1) (if they ate A1, the head is (6, 1)).\nIf E0 ate A1 at (6, 1), they grew to length 11. New body starts at (7, 1).\nIf E0 then aims for A4 (6, 0). (6, 1) -> DOWN to (6, 0). EAT.\n\nIf I am moving (3, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (5, 0)\nAnd E0 is moving (7, 1) -> (6, 1) -> (6, 0)\nWe are completely separate and I get A2, E0 gets A1 and A4. This is fine, we both get apples and avoid collision.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 1):\nT36: (4, 1). D=2 to (5, 0). Path (4, 1) -> D(4, 0) -> R(5, 0).\nThis path is slower.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving DOWN to (3, 0) is the fastest way to reach the primary target (5, 0) safely, regardless of the enemy's most likely move to (6, 1).\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\n1. T35 (Current): Move DOWN to (3, 0). D to (5, 0) is 2. This is the fastest route to A2.\n2. T36: From (3, 0), move RIGHT to (4, 0). D to (5, 0) is 1.\n3. T37: From (4, 0), move RIGHT to (5, 0) to eat A2. Length 11.\nIf the enemy is predicted to aggressively move towards (5, 0) (e.g., if they moved (7, 1) -> (7, 0) -> (6, 0) -> (5, 0)), I might reassess at T36. But their efficiency suggests they move for (6, 1) first.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",

Enemy head: (3,1), full: [(3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8)] (length 10). Apples clustered bottom-right: (6,1) adjacent left (immediate eat), chaining to (6,0) down then (5,0) left (2 more eats, total +3 by t37, score 12). Distant: (2,9) enemy-proximal (~3-5 turns for them), (9,9) accessible post-chain (~6-8 turns via row0-1 right then up col9). Enemy left-clustered (col2-3 rows1-8), likely up to (2,9) or right slowly (min 4+ east moves, body hampers quick flank; no threat to col5-7 row0-1 this turn).\n\n- **UP**: To (7,2) \u2014 empty. No growth, length 10. New snake: [(7,2), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)] (tail (7,8) drops). Safe. But diverts up into own body zone (next up (7,3) own (8,3)? No, but tightens col7; misses chain, risks (6,1) uneaten if enemy paths right later.\n- **DOWN**: To (7,0) \u2014 empty. No growth, length 10. New snake: [(7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)] (tail (7,8) drops). Safe. Sets up left to (6,0) eat #10 next, then left (5,0) #11 (t37 score 11), but skips (6,1) (uneaten, potential waste or enemy grab ~t38+). Less efficient than chain (+2 vs. +3).\n- **LEFT**: To (6,1) \u2014 apple. Growth, length 11. New snake: [(6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)] (no tail drop). Safe (apple cell free; no overlap). Executes chain: eat #10 now, DOWN (6,0) #11 t36, LEFT (5,0) #12 t37 (score 12, lead maintained). Frees space (prior tail drop last turn opened col8; future east pivot viable).\n- **RIGHT**: To (8,1) \u2014 own body. Death. Invalid.\n\nAll but RIGHT safe. LEFT optimal: immediate growth, chain efficiency (+3 apples quick), positions head for safe loops (post-t37 at (5,0), up/left to center or right to (9,9)). DOWN viable short-term but suboptimal; UP unnecessary detour. No enemy collision risk (their possible moves: left/down edge-trap/self-hit, up/right slow; targets clear).\n\n### Long-Term Plan\nt35: LEFT (6,1) eat #10 (11). t36: DOWN (6,0) eat #11 (12). t37: LEFT (5,0) eat #12 (13). t38: UP (5,1) or RIGHT (5,0\u21926,0 but eaten; check for loop). Post-chain, clear row0 col5-7; circle south-east (cols5-9 rows0-2) for safety, then east/up col9 to (9,9) ~t43 (eat #14). Watch enemy post-(2,9) (~t38-40 eat, score 10); if they probe east ~t42, block col4-5 or bait trap. Target 20+ by t60; farm if they die/self-hit.\n\nLEFT",

Analyze Safe Moves in Relation to Target (5, 0) (D=2):**\n\n*   **Move 1: RIGHT to (4, 0)**\n    *   New D to (5, 0): |5-4| + |0-0| = 1. (Reduces distance by 1. Optimal path continuation).\n*   **Move 2: LEFT to (2, 0)**\n    *   New D to (5, 0): |5-2| + |0-0| = 3. (Increases distance by 1). Avoid unless necessary for safety.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 0) is the intended and efficient move.\n\n**4. Safety Check (Collision Avoidance):**\n\nMy movement: (3, 0) -> (4, 0). Next turn (4, 0) -> (5, 0) (EAT).\n\nEnemy 0 Head is at (6, 1).\nPossible moves for E0: UP (6, 2), DOWN (6, 0) (Apple!), LEFT (5, 1), RIGHT (7, 1) (Body segment!).\n\nE0 prediction: E0 is 1 step away from A3 (6, 0).\n*   E0 will almost certainly move DOWN to **(6, 0)** and eat A3.\n\nIf E0 moves to (6, 0) and I move to (4, 0):\nT36 end state: My Head (4, 0). E0 Head (6, 0).\n\nT37 planning:\nMy possible moves from (4, 0): UP (4, 1), LEFT (3, 0), RIGHT (5, 0) (EAT!).\nI move RIGHT to (5, 0) and eat A1. Goal achieved.\n\nE0's possible moves from (6, 0) (assuming they ate the apple, length 12):\nE0 body starts at (6, 1).\nE0 might move UP (6, 1) (Moving backward/into body - fatal), LEFT (5, 0) (Head-on collision with me!), DOWN (6, -1) (Boundary - fatal), RIGHT (7, 0).\nSince E0 just ate (6, 0), they are highly constrained.\nIf E0 moves LEFT to (5, 0) in T37, and I move RIGHT to (5, 0) in T37, this is a head-on collision, killing both of us.\n\n**Rethink Safety based on T37 Conflict:**\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 0) now:\nT37: I move to (5, 0).\nE0 is at (6, 0) (length 12).\nE0's safe moves from (6, 0):\n1. UP to (6, 1): **FATAL** (into body segment).\n2. DOWN to (6, -1): **FATAL** (off board).\n3. LEFT to (5, 0): **COLLISION RISK** (If I go there).\n4. RIGHT to (7, 0): **SAFE**.\n\nE0 is forced to move RIGHT to (7, 0) unless they commit suicide or attempt a head-on collision. Since E0 leads in score, they have no reason to suicide attempt unless they are trying to tie/win the collision logic (which only works if my remaining safe moves are also suicide/collision).\n\nI must assume the enemy plays rationally and avoids suicide. E0 will move RIGHT to (7, 0).\n\nTherefore, my path:\nT36: (3, 0) -> RIGHT to (4, 0).\nT37: (4, 0) -> RIGHT to (5, 0) (EAT A1).\nEnemy path:\nT36: (6, 1) -> DOWN to (6, 0) (EAT A3).\nT37: (6, 0) -> RIGHT to (7, 0) (Escape/Pathfind).\n\nThis plan seems safe and efficient, securing A1 (5, 0).\n\n**5. Alternative Analysis (If E0 doesn't go to (6, 0)):**\nIf E0 moves UP to (6, 2) or LEFT to (5, 1) in T36, A3 (6, 0) is still available.\nIf E0 moves to (6, 2):\nT36 I move (4, 0).\nT37 I move (5, 0) (EAT A1).\nE0 is safe, A3 remains, A1 is mine.\n\nIf E0 moves to (5, 1): (E0 is aiming for the same apples as me, or aiming for A5 (8, 6) path)\nT36 I move (4, 0).\nT37 I move (5, 0) (EAT A1).\nE0 is at (5, 1). Safe separation. A3 remains. A1 is mine.\n\nIn all rational enemy scenarios, moving RIGHT to (4, 0) is the optimal and safest move to secure the next apple (5, 0).\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\n1. T36 (Current): Move RIGHT to (4, 0). Distance to A1 (5, 0) is 1. E0 likely retrieves A3 (6, 0).\n2. T37: Move RIGHT to (5, 0) to eat A1. (Length 11).\n3. T38: Assess remaining apples. Likely A2 (2, 9), A4 (9, 9), A5 (8, 6). If I am at (5, 0), A5 (8, 6) is D=9, A2 (2, 9) is D=12. I should probably move towards the center/right side of the board (A5).\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy head: (3,0), full: [(3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,7)] (length 10). Apples: chain continues\u2014(6,0) down immediate (#11 eat), then (5,0) left (#12 next). Remaining: (2,9) enemy-favored (they're col2-3 vertical, ~6-8 turns to reach via col2 up), (9,9) post-chain (~7 turns via row0 right/up col9), (8,6) mid-right detour (~10 turns, but risky near my body). Enemy at bottom-left edge: possible LEFT (2,0 empty) or RIGHT (4,0 empty); UP into self, DOWN off-board. No collision risk to my targets (6,0/5,0 far right; their max RIGHT reaches (4,0), still distant). My body clears north-east gradually (tail static at (7,8) unless no-growth).\n\n- **UP**: To (6,2) \u2014 empty. No growth, length 11. New snake: [(6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)] (tail (7,8) drops). Safe (no overlap/enemy). Opens col6 row2 but wastes (6,0) apple (uneaten, enemy unreachable soon), diverts center-ward into open space; follow-ups: left/right/up flexible but +0 now, delays chain/lead.\n- **DOWN**: To (6,0) \u2014 apple. Growth, length 12. New snake: [(6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8)] (no tail drop). Safe (apple free; enemy can't reach in 1 turn). Executes chain: eat #11 now (score 11), sets LEFT to (5,0) #12 t37 (score 12, +1 lead). Maintains south momentum, row0 clear for quick farm; post-eat, up to (5,1) or right pivot safe.\n- **LEFT**: To (5,1) \u2014 empty. No growth, length 11. New snake: [(5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7)] (tail (7,8) drops). Safe. Heads toward (5,0) down next (eat t37, score 11), but skips (6,0) (left behind, potential later revisit inefficient). Positions west but exposes (6,0) to... nothing (enemy too slow), still +1 total chain but over 2 turns vs. +2 in 2.\n- **RIGHT**: To (7,1) \u2014 own body. Death. Invalid.\n\nAll but RIGHT safe. DOWN optimal: immediate growth, chain efficiency (+2 apples by t37, score 12), keeps south-east open (row0 cols4-9 free post-chain for loops or (9,9) path). LEFT viable but suboptimal timing; UP detour, risks missing chain if enemy shifts right later (~t40+). No head-on/enemy body risks.\n\n### Long-Term Plan\nt36: DOWN (6,0) eat #11 (11). t37: LEFT (5,0) eat #12 (12). t38: UP (5,1) empty (loop south-center, avoid trap; or RIGHT back if clear). Post-chain at (5,0) score 12, head west-edge row0; circle clockwise (up col5 rows1-3, right col6-9 rows0-2) for safety/growth space. Target (9,9) ~t44 (eat #13 via row0 right to col9 up; ~5 turns post-t37). Monitor enemy: likely RIGHT to (4,0) probing east, then up col4 (slow, body trails); if they eat (2,9) ~t42-44 (score 10), block col3-4 row8-9 or bait col2 trap. Farm row0-1 cols5-9 if they stall; aim 15+ by t50, deny them flanks.\n\nDOWN",

(Moves away from the apple, avoids the immediate goal). Avoid unless required for collision safety.\n\n**4. Safety Check (Collision Avoidance - Head-on with E0):**\n\nI plan to move RIGHT to (5, 0).\nE0 Head is at (6, 0). E0's body starts at (6, 1). E0 is length 12.\n\nPossible moves for E0 from (6, 0):\n1. UP to (6, 1): **FATAL** (Into body segment).\n2. DOWN to (6, -1): **FATAL** (Boundary).\n3. LEFT to (5, 0): **COLLISION RISK** (Head-on with me!).\n4. RIGHT to (7, 0): **SAFE**.\n\nE0 is trapped: two suicide moves (UP, DOWN) leave only LEFT (5, 0) and RIGHT (7, 0).\n\nIf E0 moves LEFT to (5, 0), and I move RIGHT to (5, 0), this is a guaranteed double-kill.\nIf E0 moves RIGHT to (7, 0), I move to (5, 0) and eat safely.\n\nSince E0 has a longer snake (12 segments vs my 10 segments) and leads in score (11 vs 9), they have slightly higher potential collision leverage against me (if we collide, the longer snake may sometimes win in specific games not governed by these rules, but here it's an equal death). However, the rules state that if two heads move into the same cell, both die. Given the length advantage of E0, a rational player might try to force a tie if they predict I am forced into a suicide path only. But I have two safe moves (UP and RIGHT).\n\nIf E0 predicts I move RIGHT to eat the apple:\n*   If E0 attempts a head-on collision (LEFT to (5, 0)), both die. This results in an E0 win (11 apples vs 9 apples).\n*   If E0 avoids collision (RIGHT to (7, 0)), I get the apple and increase my score to 10. E0 is safe.\n\nIf E0 fears I might move UP to (4, 1) to avoid the conflict point, E0 might still choose RIGHT (7, 0) to secure a safe path away, or they might gamble on LEFT (5, 0) if they are confident I will move RIGHT.\n\nLooking globally, E0 is highly constrained at (6, 0). Moving RIGHT to (7, 0) is the only rational path that guarantees their survival. Trying to force a double-kill when they are winning risks the entire game state for both, a move usually reserved for desperation. E0 has plenty of safe space to move towards the right side or up the board.\n\nI assume E0 plays rationally and moves RIGHT to (7, 0). I proceed to eat the apple.\n\nFinal decision: Move RIGHT to (5, 0).\n\n**5. Long-Term Plan (T38 onwards):**\nAfter eating (5, 0), I will be at (5, 0), length 11, score 10. E0 will be at (7, 0), length 12, score 11.\nRemaining Apples: (2, 9), (9, 9), (8, 6), (6, 7).\n\n*   From (5, 0):\n    *   A4 (8, 6): D = 3 + 6 = 9.\n    *   A5 (6, 7): D = 1 + 7 = 8. (Closest).\n    *   A2 (2, 9): D = 3 + 9 = 12.\n    *   A3 (9, 9): D = 4 + 9 = 13.\n\nThe next optimal target is A5 (6, 7). The most straightforward path is generally UP/RIGHT.\nT38: Move UP to (5, 1).\nT39: Move UP to (5, 2).\nT40: Move RIGHT to (6, 2) or UP to (5, 3). (Need to check E0's position).\nThe plan is to move towards A5 (6, 7) or A4 (8, 6) on the right side of the board.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\n1. T37 (Current): Move RIGHT to (5, 0) to eat A1.\n2.

Follow-ups constrained short-term (t38: only RIGHT to (8,0) safe, as LEFT/UP own body; t39: RIGHT (9,0); t40: UP (9,1) or LEFT own). Opens east row0 (cols7-9 free) for pivot north to (9,9).\n\nOnly RIGHT guaranteed safe/alive (LEFT likely deadly collision). RIGHT suboptimal (misses +1, enemy closes gap), but prioritizes survival per rules (\"never choose a move that obviously kills you\"; avoid likely head-on). Post-move, enemy eats/grows at (5,0), but forced UP t38 to (5,1) (their LEFT own, RIGHT into my (6,0) body = their death). No pursuit risk; my east chain clears space gradually (tail north, body follows row0 west segments persist but non-blocking for my path). Other apples untouched.\n\n### Long-Term Plan\nt37: RIGHT (7,0) safe (yield (5,0) to enemy for 11-10). t38: RIGHT (8,0). t39: RIGHT (9,0). t40: UP (9,1), then north col9 (UP each turn) to (9,9) ~t48 eat #12 (+1 to 12, lead regain). Post-eat at (9,9), grow; pivot west/left on row9 (target (2,9)? But enemy likely claims it ~t45 via col2 UP; avoid). If enemy stalls post-(5,1) (e.g., circles center cols3-5), farm (8,6) detour ~t50 via col8 down from row9 (monitor my body clearance: row4-8 col7-8 frees as tail advances). Deny enemy (6,7)/(8,6) by body positioning; aim 15+ by t60, block col5-6 if they east. Worst: they eat (2,9) to 11 tie t45, but my (9,9) secures edge.\n\nRIGHT",

Score: 11. (The enemy must have moved RIGHT from (6, 0) to (7, 0) in T37, securing their survival path).\nBody (head-to-tail, length 11): (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7).\n\nApples remaining (A):\nA1: (2, 9)\nA2: (9, 9)\nA3: (8, 6)\nA4: (6, 7)\nA5: (5, 9)\n\n**1. Locate Target Apple and Calculate Distance (Manhattan Distance D) from My Head (5, 0):**\nWe are now targeting the closest accessible apple.\n\nA4 (6, 7). D = |6-5| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8. (Closest by D)\nA3 (8, 6). D = |8-5| + |6-0| = 3 + 6 = 9.\nA5 (5, 9). D = |5-5| + |9-0| = 0 + 9 = 9. (Straight UP)\nA1 (2, 9). D = |2-5| + |9-0| = 3 + 9 = 12.\nA2 (9, 9). D = |9-5| + |9-0| = 4 + 9 = 13.\n\nThe natural path is to move towards A4 (6, 7) or A5 (5, 9). Since A5 (5, 9) is straight up, (5, 1) or (5, 2) is a good starting direction, but A4 (6, 7) is slightly closer. Let's aim UP into the middle of the board, which keeps us away from the enemy's current position on the bottom right/center.\n\n**2. Determine Safe Moves from (5, 0):**\nPossible moves: (5, 1) UP, (5, -1) DOWN, (4, 0) LEFT, (6, 0) RIGHT.\n\n*   **Boundary Checks:** DOWN (5, -1) is fatal.\n*   **Self-Collision Checks (My body segments: (4, 0), (3, 0), ...):**\n    *   (4, 0) LEFT: This is the immediate neck segment. **FATAL (Moving backward).**\n*   **Enemy Collision Checks (E0 Head at (7, 0). E0 body segments: (6, 0), (6, 1), ...):**\n    *   (6, 0) RIGHT: This cell is occupied by E0's body segment (6, 0). **FATAL.**\n\nSafe moves: UP (5, 1).\n\n**3. Analyze Safe Moves in Relation to Target:**\nWe only have one safe move: UP to (5, 1). This move takes us closer to all apples (except for those directly to the right, which are blocked anyway). Specifically, D to A4 (6, 7) reduces to D=7 (from 8). D to A5 (5, 9) reduces to D=8 (from 9).\n\n**4. Considering Enemy Movement (E0 Head at (7, 0)):**\nE0 is at (7, 0).\nPossible moves for E0: (7, 1) UP, (7, -1) DOWN (Boundary), (6, 0) LEFT, (8, 0) RIGHT.\n\n*   (7, 1) UP: Into E0 body segment (7, 1). **FATAL.**\n*   (7, -1) DOWN: Boundary. **FATAL.**\n*   (6, 0) LEFT: Into E0 body segment (6, 0). **FATAL.**\n*   (8, 0) RIGHT: Safe move.\n\nE0 is cornered and has only one safe move: RIGHT to (8, 0). Since E0 will move to (8, 0), there is no risk of a head-on collision with my forced move to (5, 1).\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nThe only safe and viable move is UP. This advances us toward the apples in the upper half of the board.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\n1. T38 (Current): Move UP to (5, 1), escaping the crowded bottom row and moving towards A4 (6, 7) or A5 (5, 9).\n2. T39: From (5, 1), continue UP to (5, 2) or RIGHT to (6, 1) depending on E0's location (likely (8, 0) or circling around the right side). The path looks clear UP.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nUP",

All look clear based on current board state.\n\n*   **LEFT (4, 1):**\n    *   Moves us closer to the congested left side where my snake body is currently densest (3, X and 2, X).\n    *   (4, 1) is adjacent to my body segment (3, 1).\n    *   This move takes us slightly away from A4 and A5.\n\nSince the goal is to travel North/Northeast to the apples, UP (5, 2) is the much better strategic choice.\n\n**4. Check for Head-on Collisions (Enemy Head E0 at (8, 0)):**\nE0 is at (8, 0). Its immediate safe moves are:\n*   (8, 1) UP: Into E0 body (8, 1). **FATAL.**\n*   (7, 0) LEFT: Into E0 body (7, 0). **FATAL.**\n*   (9, 0) RIGHT: Safe move, near boundary.\n*   (8, -1) DOWN: Boundary. **FATAL.**\n\nE0 is cornered and must move RIGHT to (9, 0) or potentially die if it miscalculates, but assuming rational play, E0 moves to (9, 0).\nMy move UP to (5, 2) is far from (8, 0) or (9, 0). No head-on collision risk.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nUP (5, 2) is the safest and most optimal move to continue progress towards the apples in the upper board.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1. T39 (Current): Move UP to (5, 2).\n2. T40: Move UP to (5, 3). This column (5, X) seems currently vacant and provides a rapid path North, allowing us to then turn LEFT or RIGHT for specific apples like A4 (6, 7) or A5 (5, 9). We should aim to secure A5 (5, 9) first as it is directly ahead.\n\nUP",

A5 (5, 9) is now directly 7 steps UP.\n\n**1. Determine Target Apple:**\nWe are aiming North for the dense cluster of apples. A5 (5, 9) is the most direct target.\nDistance to A5 (5, 9): D = 7 (straight up).\nDistance to A4 (6, 7): D = |6-5| + |7-2| = 1 + 5 = 6. (Closest target).\nDistance to A3 (8, 6): D = |8-5| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7.\n\nA4 (6, 7) is currently the closest target. A5 (5, 9) is slightly further but requires straight movement in area (column 5) that is currently open. Let's prioritize moving North first, which serves both targets.\n\n**2. Determine Safe Moves from (5, 2):**\nPossible moves: (5, 3) UP, (5, 1) DOWN, (4, 2) LEFT, (6, 2) RIGHT.\n\n*   **Boundary & Self-Collision Checks:**\n    *   (5, 1) DOWN: **FATAL.** This is the immediate neck segment.\n    *   (4, 2) LEFT: (4, 2) is empty. Safe.\n    *   (6, 2) RIGHT: (6, 2) is empty. Safe.\n    *   (5, 3) UP: (5, 3) is empty. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP (5, 3), LEFT (4, 2), RIGHT (6, 2). All three directions are clear of our own body and boundaries.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **UP (5, 3):**\n    *   Moves directly toward A5 (5, 9).\n    *   Puts us in an open column.\n    *   Enemy E0 is far away at (9, 0).\n    *   This is the best trajectory for maximizing speed toward a high-value apple zone.\n\n*   **RIGHT (6, 2):**\n    *   Moves us closer to A4 (6, 7) and A3 (8, 6).\n    *   Path finding efficiency: We are currently 5 steps below A4 (6, 7). Moving UP is generally better than moving horizontally this low down. If we move RIGHT, we are now (6, 2), requiring 5 steps UP. Total distance remains D=6 (1 right, 5 up).\n    *   This is a good alternative path if UP were blocked.\n\n*   **LEFT (4, 2):**\n    *   Moves us away from the main target cluster and closer to the congested body segments (specifically (3, 2)).\n    *   Not an optimal move for apple seeking right now.\n\n**4. Check for Enemy Movement and Collisions:**\nEnemy Head E0 is at (9, 0).\nPossible moves for E0:\n1. (9, 1) UP: Safe. Moves towards A2 (9, 9).\n2. (9, -1) DOWN: Boundary. Fatal.\n3. (8, 0) LEFT: E0 body (8, 0). Fatal.\n4. (10, 0) RIGHT: Boundary. Fatal.\n\nE0 is cornered and *must* move UP to (9, 1) to survive.\nMy move UP to (5, 3) is far from (9, 1). No collision risk.\n\n**5. Conclusion and Strategy:**\nMoving UP to (5, 3) keeps us on the quickest path toward A5 (5, 9) and maintains flexibility for A4 (6, 7) or A3 (8, 6) later.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue moving straight UP the 5th column until we reach (5, 8). This avoids the dense snake bodies to the left and is a fast path to the apple cluster. Based on the open path, we should prioritize A5 (5, 9).\nT40: UP (5, 3)\nT41: UP (5, 4)\nT42: UP (5, 5)\n...\nT46: UP (5, 9) - Eat A5.\n\nUP",

(Closest overall target by manhattan distance)\nA3 (8, 6): D = |8-5| + |6-5| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nA5 is still highly strategic as it requires minimal maneuvering and is only one step farther than A4. Given our current straight path in column 5, continuing UP is the most efficient choice, assuming it is safe.\n\n**2.

Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **UP (5, 6):**\n    *   Moves directly toward A5 (5, 9), reducing distance by 1.\n    *   Highly optimal for the current strategy.\n\n*   **RIGHT (6, 5):**\n    *   Moves closer to A4 (6, 7). New position (6, 5). Distance to A4 is 2.\n    *   If we switch targets to A4, this is the first step. However, it abandons the straight path to A5. A5 is a corner apple that can give us access to the top row for A1 or A2 (though A2 is Snake 0's likely target). Sticking to A5 for now feels slightly better for coverage.\n\n*   **LEFT (4, 5):**\n    *   Moves away from apples. Not optimal.\n\n**4. Check for Enemy Movement and Collisions:**\nEnemy Head E0 is at (9, 3). E0 is very likely targeting A2 (9, 9).\nPossible safe moves for E0:\n1. (9, 4) UP: Clear. Moves towards A2 (9, 9). (Most likely)\n2. (8, 3) LEFT: (8, 3) is E0 Body segment. **FATAL.**\n3. (10, 3) RIGHT: Boundary. Fatal.\n4. (9, 2) DOWN: E0 Neck segment (9, 2). **FATAL.**\n\nSnake 0's only safe move is UP (9, 4).\nIf E0 moves to (9, 4), and we move to (5, 6), there is no collision risk. The distance between us is large.\n\n**5. Conclusion and Strategy:**\nThe movement UP towards (5, 6) is safe, efficient, and continues the most direct route to A5 (5, 9).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nContinue moving straight UP the 5th column to A5 (5, 9).\nT43: UP (5, 6)\nT44: UP (5, 7)\nT45: UP (5, 8)\nT46: UP (5, 9) - Eat A5.\nAfter eating A5, we will have a clear path to A4 (6, 7) or a quick route across the top edge.\n\nUP",

(Closest by Manhattan distance)\nA3 (8, 6): D = |8-5| + |6-6| = 3 + 0 = 3.\n\nSince A5 requires only straight movement along the currently clear column 5, and A4 requires a turn and then only has a distance advantage of 1, continuing UP towards A5 remains the optimal primary strategy for efficiency and safety.\n\n**2.

(3 turns to apple)\n\nIf we move RIGHT (6, 6):\n*   T45: UP to (6, 7) - Eat A4. (2 turns to apple)\n\nTargeting A4 (6, 7) is quicker by one turn: 2 moves vs 3 moves.\nThe move RIGHT (6, 6) seems slightly better due to the time advantage, provided it doesn't lead to a dangerous situation with Snake 0.\n\n**5. Check for Enemy Movement and Collisions (Snake 0 at (9, 4)):**\nSnake 0 is large and at (9, 4). They are clearly aiming for A2 (9, 9) or perhaps A3 (8, 6).\nSafe moves for E0: UP (9, 5), LEFT (8, 4), DOWN (9, 3-old tail/new body).\n(9, 3) is a body segment, but since the tail at (8, 2) is moving to (7, 1), segment (9, 3) remains.\n\n*   E0 Body at (9, 3). No, (9, 3) is segment 2. (9, 2) is segment 3. (8, 2) is the current tail. The new tail will be (9, 3). Wait, E0 body is: [(9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2)]. The tail is (8, 2). If E0 doesn't eat, (8, 2) is vacated.\n    *   E0 moves DOWN (9, 3): This is currently segment (9, 3). FATAL. E0 is at (9, 4). (9, 3) is its neck.\n    *   E0 moves LEFT (8, 4): (8, 4) is clear. Safe.\n    *   E0 moves UP (9, 5): (9, 5) is clear. Safe. (Most likely, aiming for A2 (9, 9)).\n    *   E0 moves RIGHT (10, 4): Boundary. FATAL.\n\nIf E0 moves UP (9, 5) or LEFT (8, 4), they move further away from us, minimizing collision risk for our move to (6, 6) or (5, 7).\n\n*   If we move RIGHT (6, 6): Distance to E0 at (9, 4) is 4 + 2 = 6. Safe.\n*   If we move UP (5, 7): Distance to E0 at (9, 4) is 4 + 3 = 7. Safe.\n\n**6. Final Decision:**\nMoving RIGHT towards A4 is one turn faster (2 moves vs 3). A4 (6, 7) and A5 (5, 9) are both easily accessible. Given the score difference (E0 is ahead 11 to 10), minimizing apple acquisition time is beneficial.\n\nSwitching target to A4 (6, 7) via RIGHT (6, 6) is the optimal move.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nT44: RIGHT (6, 6). New target A4 (6, 7).\nT45: UP (6, 7) - Eat A4.\nAfter eating A4, we are at (6, 7). We can then target A3 (8, 6) or A5 (5, 9), or transition toward the top apples A1 (2, 9) and A2 (9, 9).\n\nRIGHT",

Determine Target Apple and Strategy:**\nOur current target is A4 (6, 7).\nDistance to A4 (6, 7) from (6, 6): D = 1 (straight up).\n\n**2. Determine Safe Moves from (6, 6):**\nPossible moves: (6, 7) UP, (6, 5) DOWN, (5, 6) LEFT, (7, 6) RIGHT.\n\n*   **Boundary & Self-Collision Checks:**\n    *   (5, 6) LEFT: **FATAL.** This is the immediate neck segment.\n    *   (6, 5) DOWN: (6, 5) is empty. Safe.\n    *   (7, 6) RIGHT: (7, 6) is empty. Safe.\n    *   (6, 7) UP: (6, 7) is an apple (A4). Safe and results in eating.\n\nSafe moves: UP (6, 7), DOWN (6, 5), RIGHT (7, 6).\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **UP (6, 7):** EATS A4. Excellent move. Next turn we are at (6, 7) and our length increases.\n*   **RIGHT (7, 6):** Moves towards A3 (8, 6). Distance to A3 is 1. Good alternative, but sacrifices the immediate apple A4.\n*   **DOWN (6, 5):** Moves away from all apples. Avoid.\n\nThe clear best move is UP, as it secures an apple immediately and places us in a good position for future apples (A3 or A5).\n\n**4. Check for Enemy Movement and Collisions (Snake 0 at (8, 4)):**\nSnake 0 is at (8, 4).\nPossible moves for E0: UP (8, 5), DOWN (8, 3), LEFT (7, 4), RIGHT (9, 4) - FATAL (neck).\n\n*   E0 (8, 4) aiming for A3 (8, 6) or A2 (9, 9).\n    *   If E0 moves UP (8, 5): E0 is now 1 cell from A3.\n    *   If E0 moves LEFT (7, 4): E0 is moving inward/south.\n    *   If E0 moves DOWN (8, 3): E0 is moving south.\n\nOur move UP to (6, 7) is distant from E0's possible new locations ((8, 5), (7, 4), (8, 3)). There is no risk of head-on collision.\n\n**5. Final Decision:**\nMove UP to eat A4 (6, 7). This secures a point and keeps us competitive with Snake 0.\n\n**Strategy Note (Turn 46 onward):**\nAfter eating A4 at (6, 7), we will be at length 12. We should then target A3 (8, 6) or A5 (5, 9).\n*   A3 (8, 6): 1 step RIGHT, then 1 step DOWN (if E0 hasn't taken it).\n*   A5 (5, 9): 1 step LEFT, 2 steps UP.\nSince A3 is closer and potentially contested by E0 (if E0 went (8, 5)), we should prioritize A3 if available. If E0 moves to (8, 5), we can move RIGHT to (7, 7) and then DOWN/RIGHT to intercept A3, or pivot to A5 (5, 9).\n\nUP",

Enemy head: (6,6), full: [(6,6), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (3,1)] (length 11, apples 10). Apples: (2,9), (9,9), (8,6), (6,7), (5,9). Right side (cols 7-9, rows 2-8) mostly open except my bottom coil and enemy mid-left; enemy likely moves UP to eat (6,7), growing to 11 apples/12 length.\n\n- **UP**: To (8,5) \u2014 empty. Safe; no enemy reach. Positions for next UP to (8,6) apple (eat #12 at t46, score 12-11 post-enemy eat). Closest apple (8,6) manhattan 2; keeps right-edge path open toward (9,9). Multiple follow-ups (UP/LEFT/RIGHT from (8,5)).\n- **DOWN**: To (8,3) \u2014 empty. Safe; no enemy reach. But moves away from apples (back toward own coil); next options limited (UP back, LEFT to (7,3) empty, RIGHT own body soon, DOWN (8,2) own). Delays eat to t47+; risks tie/lead loss.\n- **LEFT**: To (7,4) \u2014 empty. Safe; no enemy reach. Opens center access but detours from (8,6) (eat at t47 via UP-RIGHT-UP or RIGHT-UP-UP, 3 turns). Follow-ups ok (UP/LEFT/DOWN from (7,4)) but slower; unnecessary vs. direct path.\n- **RIGHT**: To (9,4) \u2014 own body (immediate backward collision). Death. Invalid.\n\nAll but RIGHT safe; UP best\u2014fastest to nearest apple (2 turns vs. 3+), avoids temporary tie risk (enemy eats t45 to 11, I eat t46 to 12), maintains edge safety/mobility. No head-on risk; post-t46, my tail vacates (7,1) aiding bottom loops.\n\n### Long-Term Plan\nt45: UP (8,5). t46: UP (8,6) eat #12 (grow to 13, score 12-11). t47: RIGHT (9,6) toward (9,9) (~t50 eat #13 via UP-UP-UP); if enemy detours from (5,9) toward right, LEFT to (8,6) wait then intercept/block at (9,7)/(8,7). t51+: Target (5,9) if free (~t54 #14) or (2,9) (~t57 #14); use vacated bottom tail for safe circling, block enemy center push, aim 16+ by t60 for lead buffer.\n\nUP",

A5 (7, 6): D1 = |7-6| + |6-7| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n3. A4 (5, 9): D1 = |5-6| + |9-7| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nA5 (7, 6) is the closest apple (D=2).\nA3 (8, 6) is very close to Snake 0 (D0 = 1). Snake 0 is highly likely to take A3 by moving UP.\n\nLet's prioritize A5 (7, 6).\n\n**2.

Evaluate Safe Moves towards A5 (7, 6):**\nTarget A5 (7, 6).\n\n*   **RIGHT (7, 7):** This moves us one step closer to the target (7, 6). From (7, 7), the next move would be DOWN to (7, 6) (EAT A5). This sets up the capture in 2 turns.\n    *   Distance to A5 (7, 6) from (7, 7): D = 1.\n*   **UP (6, 8):** Moves us away from all nearby targets. Avoid.\n*   **LEFT (5, 7):** Moves towards A4 (5, 9). Distance to A4 from (5, 7) is D=2. This is a good alternative path if A5 fails.\n\n**4. Check Enemy Interaction (Snake 0 at (8, 5)):**\nSnake 0 aims for A3 (8, 6) or A5 (7, 6).\n\nPossible moves for E0 (8, 5):\n*   UP (8, 6): EATS A3. (Likeliest move)\n*   DOWN (8, 4): FATAL (Neck).\n*   LEFT (7, 5): Safe. Moves toward A5.\n*   RIGHT (9, 5): Safe. Moves toward A2 (9, 9).\n\nIf E0 moves UP (8, 6) (Highly likely):\n*   H0 is at (8, 6).\n*   Our move RIGHT (7, 7) is safe from E0.\n\nIf E0 moves LEFT (7, 5) (Alternative to contest A5):\n*   H0 is at (7, 5).\n*   Our move RIGHT (7, 7). H1 and H0 are distant and safe.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (7, 7), we position ourselves perfectly to take A5 (7, 6) next turn. E0 is likely occupied with A3 (8, 6).\n\n**Collision Check:**\nAre the opposing head movements likely to collide?\n*   H1 -> (7, 7).\n*   H0 -> (8, 6) or (7, 5) or (9, 5).\nNo head-on collision risk on this turn.\n\n**5. Final Decision:**\nMove RIGHT to (7, 7) to set up for A5 (7, 6) next turn. This is the optimal path to the nearest uncontested (D=2, vs D=3 for A3) apple. Even if E0 moves towards A5 (7, 6) by moving LEFT to (7, 5), we arrive at (7, 7) and are in a better position next turn (we can drop down to (7, 6) to eat, while E0 would have to move up/right).\n\n**Strategy Note (Turn 47 onward):**\nIf we move RIGHT to (7, 7):\nNext turn, we move DOWN to (7, 6) to eat A5. This will put us at (7, 6), length 13.\nE0 is highly likely to have taken A3 (8, 6). If E0 did not take A3, we should assess taking it after securing A5, or pivoting to A4 (5, 9) or A2 (9, 9) depending on E0's position.\n\nRIGHT",

Score: 11.\nBody (length 11, head-to-tail): [(6, 7), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0)].\nThe tail is currently at (3, 0). If we don't eat, our tail vanishes, and (3, 0) becomes empty.\n\nEnemy Snake (ID 0):\nHead (H0): (8, 6) - *Self-Correction/Observation*: Based on the board state and the provided body, Snake 0 did indeed move from (8, 5) to (8, 6) last turn (Turn 46). It seems they ate the apple that was at (8, 6).\nThe provided state now shows Snake 0's head at (8, 6).\nLength: 13. Score: 12.\nBody (length 12, head-to-tail): [(8, 5), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1)].\nThe tail is currently at (7, 1). If they don't eat, their tail vanishes, and (7, 1) becomes empty.\n\nApples (A):\nA1: (2, 9) (Far North-West)\nA2: (9, 9) (North-East corner, near H0)\nA3: (5, 9) (North center)\nA4: (7, 6) (Immediate vicinity of H1)\nA5: (4, 7) (West of H1)\n\n**1. Determine Target Apple and Strategy:**\n\nH1 is at (7, 7).\nH0 is at (8, 6). H0 just ate an apple and is slightly longer and ahead in score.\n\nClosest Apple:\nA4 (7, 6): Manhattan distance D1 = |7-7| + |6-7| = 1. This is an immediate capture target.\n\nOther targets:\nA5 (4, 7): D1 = |4-7| + |7-7| = 3.\nA2 (9, 9): D1 = |9-7| + |9-7| = 4. H0 is close (D0 = 3).\n\nOur primary goal is to move DOWN to (7, 6) and eat A4.\n\n**2. Determine Safe Moves from (7, 7):**\nPossible moves: (7, 8) UP, (7, 6) DOWN (A4), (6, 7) LEFT (T), (8, 7) RIGHT.\n\n*   (6, 7) LEFT: **FATAL.** This is the immediate neck segment.\n*   (7, 8) UP: (7, 8) is empty. Safe.\n*   (8, 7) RIGHT: (8, 7) is empty. Safe.\n*   (7, 6) DOWN: (7, 6) is A4. Capturing apple. Safe if no head collision.\n\nSafe moves: UP, RIGHT, DOWN (Eat A4).\n\n**3. Evaluate DOWN (7, 6) for Capture/Collision:**\n\nTarget: (7, 6).\n\nEnemy Head H0 is at (8, 6).\nH0's neighbors: (8, 7) UP (.), (8, 5) DOWN (T), (7, 6) LEFT (A4 - our target), (9, 6) RIGHT (.).\n\nIf we move DOWN to (7, 6), we eat A4.\nIf H0 moves LEFT to (7, 6), we collide head-on and both die.\n\nWe must determine the probability of H0 moving LEFT.\n\nSnake 0's immediate options from (8, 6):\n1.  **LEFT (7, 6):** Collides with us, but they gain an apple/point IF we don't also move there (which we are planning). If they predict we move elsewhere, this is a valid move. However, given their score lead, and their position, they might prioritize a clear shot at A2 (9, 9).\n2.  **UP (8, 7):** Safe, moves towards A2 (D=2 now).\n3.  **RIGHT (9, 6):** Safe, moves towards A2 (D=3).\n4.  **DOWN (8, 5):** **FATAL** (Neck segment).\n\nIf H0 moves LEFT to (7, 6), they initiate a mutual kill to prevent us from taking A4. This is a very aggressive move, but possible since they currently have the score lead (12 vs 11).\n\nIf we assume E0 plays rationally (avoiding self-death and prioritizing safe points), they should move UP to (8, 7) to start contesting A2 (9, 9), distance 2.\nDistance to A2 from (8, 6): |9-8| + |9-6| = 1 + 3 = 4.\nDistance to A2 from (8, 7): |9-8| + |9-7| = 1 + 2 = 3.\nDistance to A2 from (9, 6): |9-9| + |9-6| = 3.\n\nMoving UP or RIGHT seems safer for H0 and moves them towards the high-value A2. H0 moving RIGHT (9, 6) or UP (8, 7) will safely avoid collision.\n\nIf we move DOWN (7, 6):\n*   If H0 moves UP (8, 7) or RIGHT (9, 6): We eat successfully. (Preferred outcome)\n*   If H0 moves LEFT (7, 6): We die, H0 dies. This ties the score at 12/12 before the simultaneous deaths. Since H0 had 12 and we had 11, the game state should check the scores after the turn. If both die, the game ends immediately. The previous highest apple score wins. If tied, it's a draw. We would not win this way.\n\n**Alternative Moves:**\n\n1. **RIGHT (8, 7):**\n   *   Sets us up for a move UP (8, 8) or RIGHT (9, 7).\n   *   If H0 moves UP (8, 7), we collide H-H (Death, Draw risk). This is a fatal collision risk as H0 has a clear path UP to the empty (8, 7).\n\n2. **UP (7, 8):**\n   *   Safest move. Moves us away from both danger and immediate apples.\n   *   We concede A4 (7, 6) to H0 if H0 moves LEFT. H0 gets 13, we stay at 11. H0 wins the score race.\n\n**Risk Assessment and Priority:**\nWe are slightly behind (11 vs 12). Conceding an apple that is right next to us is highly detrimental for score competitive purposes. We must try to capture A4 (7, 6).\n\nLet's re-evaluate H0's likely move from (8, 6).\nH0 has just eaten, so they are long. Their primary long-term goal is A2 (9, 9) or A3 (5, 9).\n*   Path to A2 (9, 9) via UP (8, 7). (D=3)\n*   Path to A2 (9, 9) via RIGHT (9, 6). (D=3)\n*   Path to A3 (5, 9) via LEFT (7, 6) -> UP/LEFT. (7, 6) is crowded/contentious.\n\nIf H0 is prioritizing survival and maximizing score, moving UP (8, 7) is the cleanest route toward A2 (9, 9). Moving LEFT to (7, 6) forces a collision if we predict the optimal move. When the opponent is ahead and has an alternative safe route to a high-value apple, they are less likely to risk a guaranteed self/mutual death over a contestable apple, especially when taking that apple requires hitting the adjacent segment which is likely to be occupied by the opponent's head after they moved optimally last turn (we moved to (7, 7) to block them from getting the apple first, which was the intent).\n\nOur move RIGHT led us to (7, 7). H0's body is (6, 7) to our LEFT. H0's head is (8, 6).\n\nIf H0 moves LEFT (7, 6): They kill us/themselves.\nIf H0 moves UP (8, 7): We move DOWN (7, 6) and eat.\nIf H0 moves RIGHT (9, 6): We move DOWN (7, 6) and eat.\n\nGiven the high value of A4 for our score, and the reasonable expectation that H0 will prioritize the safer path towards A2, moving DOWN is the aggressive but necessary move. If H0 uses this opportunity to force a draw/loss for us, it confirms their aggressive intent, but we cannot afford to back off from every possible collision.\n\n**Decision:** Commit to the capture of A4 (7, 6).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter eating A4 (7, 6), we will be at (7, 6), length 13, score 12. Snake 0 is likely at (8, 7) or (9, 6), length 13, score 12. The score will be tied.\nNext target will be A5 (4, 7) or A3 (5, 9). We will assess H0's proximity to A2 (9, 9) to decide if we contest, or pivot NW to (5, 9) or (4, 7).\n\nDOWN",
