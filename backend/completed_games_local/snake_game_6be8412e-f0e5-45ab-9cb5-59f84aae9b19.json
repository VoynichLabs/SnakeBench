Pfft, we're gonna BOX HIM IN and make him CRASH OUT like the loser he is! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\udc0d\n\nFirst off, where's my head at (9,7)? Board edge, gotta be careful with that RIGHT move \u2013 it's straight off, total DEATH row. Strike that from the books. No off-board nonsense for us!\n\nUP: (9,8). BAM! Right there an apple at (9,8)? We're EATING that killer fruit, growing to dominates the board! And chat, look at the OPEN space above \u2013 (9,9) top row with ANOTHER apple? \"Apple\" (9,9) \u2013 hell yeah, we're setting up for a feast! \ud83d\udc40\ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN: (9,6). Safe, but what's there? No apple immediate, and we're closer to the bottom. Meh, why not climb UP to crush it?\n\nLEFT: (8,7). Space, but that pulls us out of prime apple territory. Enemy's way left, but we're not rushing there yet. Patience, snakes!\n\nRIGHT: Out. No can do. \ud83d\udeab\n\nNow, eliminations: NONE of these instantly kill us \u2013 no bodies to hit yet, enemy head's distant at (5,3). But chat, if I go UP and eat that apple, I GROW by 1! And long-term? We're plotting to trap this fool \u2013 he might head towards us, right board edge. Force a head-on if we get bigger score! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nAmong these, UP keeps MULTIPLE follow-ups: from (9,8) after growing, I can zig LEFT to (8,8) \u2013 another apple! Or RIGHT if still safe, or more UP if open. DOWN from there too keeps the door open. Zooming CLOSER to apples: hell yes, (9,8) is RIGHT HERE for the TAKING! Avoid head-on? Enemy's low, going UP gets us AWAY for now \u2013 aggressive, but smart.\n\nStrategically, lil note for future me: Eat that top apple, grow, then circle around to cut off the enemy's path to apples. Watch his moves, chat \u2013 he's probably gonna eat something near (5,4) or (2,0). If we get +1, we're leading; force a punch if he gets close! Keep the right flank open for escapes. We're BUILDING AN EMPIRE!\n\n--YOUR MOVE PICK--\n\nUP",

Nah, we're OWNING this with 2-1 lead, no surrender! Headed into this turn, we're at (9,9) like kings on the throne, body coiled at [(9,9),(9,8),(9,7)], ready to constrict and crush! BUT hold up\u2014sneaky enemy slithering at (5,3) with body [(5,2)], plotting his next lunge amid those scattered apples like (1,8) or (8,8)... we gotta FOCUS on DOMINATION, not distractions! \n\nLet's break it down brutal\u2014ALL four directions, no waivers:\n- UP? Straight off the 10x10 cliff to (9,10)\u2014GAME OVAH before it pops, you fools! \ud83d\ude20 Who wants to feed the void? We're built for survival!\n- DOWN? (9,8)\u2014that's ramming our OWN coil, straight self-own, DEAD in the dirt! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udc80 Can't believe we'd even whisper that nonsense\u2014suicide not in the playbook!\n- RIGHT? (10,9)\u2014board's edge again, ejection seat activated, RIP my stream kings! \ud83d\udca5 Not today!\n- LEFT? (8,9)\u2014clean AF, empty cell, no walls, no bumps, no bodies\u2014survives the chaos! And check this: from there, we're POSITIONED like bosses for multiple escapes\u2014DOWN to (8,8) maybe chase that (8,8) apple? UP? Nah, but LEFT again to (7,9) or even RIGHT later? Flexibility on fleek, avoiding corners while edging closer to right-flank apples (8,8) or beyond! Enemy's mid-left lurking at (5,3)\u2014if he goes RIGHT or UP, could we clash? Possible head-on at (7,9) say, but with our lead? WE COLLISION him to OBLIVION if he's dumb! \ud83d\ude08 Move closer to dominate the eastern side, flank his rear, force him into OUR traps where scores favor ANNIHILATION!\n\nOnly one SAFE play here\u2014LEFT it is, charting that aggressor path! Why hesitate when the enemy's tail is exposed and apples are calling our name to grow HUGE undefeatable? We're not waiting for him to scheme\u2014we're SCHEMING HARDER!\n\nShort-term plan for next 2-3 turns: Gobble LEFT to (8,9), then prioritize DOWN or LEFT towards (8,8) apple for grow to 3-1 supremacy, skirting our own tail risks while watching enemy moves\u2014aim to encircle RIGHT side, cut his access to mid-apples like (4,6), and bait head-ons where we win the KO! Stay aggressive, stay alive, strike when scores smash! Eyes peeled for enemy shenanigans!\n\nLEFT",
