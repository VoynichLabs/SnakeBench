The closest apple from there would be (2, 6) which is 2 steps right, or (0, 3) which is 3 steps down.\n\n2. **DOWN to (0, 4)**: Safe, and gets me one step closer to apple at (0, 3). From (0, 4), I could reach (0, 3) next turn.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (1, 5)**: Safe. From there, I have multiple options and can head toward either (2, 6) or prepare for other apples.\n\n**Strategy consideration:**\nThe apple at (0, 3) is only 2 steps away (down, then down again). However, I need to also consider enemy snake #1 at (2, 0). It's far away from me, so immediate collision risk is low.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible moves. Snake #1 at (2, 0) might move toward nearby apples. There's an apple at (8, 0) on the same row, and (0, 3) is also accessible.\n\nGiven that (0, 3) is the closest apple to me (2 steps away), and moving DOWN keeps me on the left edge where I have less maneuverability but also less collision risk, I should consider whether RIGHT might be better for long-term flexibility.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: The apple at (0, 3) is very close. Moving DOWN to (0, 4) sets me up perfectly to eat it next turn. This is a clear immediate objective.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move toward apple at (0, 3), then reposition to approach other apples while keeping escape routes open.\n\nDOWN",

Analyze Safety:**\n*   **My possible moves:**\n    *   UP to `(1, 5)`: Empty.\n    *   DOWN to `(1, 3)`: This is my current tail. Since I am moving, my tail will vacate this spot (unless I ate an apple last turn, which I did not, as I moved UP to `(1, 4)` without eating). This is safe.\n    *   LEFT to `(0, 4)`: Empty.\n    *   RIGHT to `(2, 4)`: Empty.\n*   **Enemy moves (Hypothesis):**\n    *   The enemy is at `(3, 1)`. They might move UP to `(3, 2)` or LEFT to `(2, 1)`.\n    *   If I move UP, I end up at `(1, 5)`. No collision risk.\n    *   If I move RIGHT, I end up at `(2, 4)`.\n    *   If the enemy moves UP to `(3, 2)`, we are safe. If they move LEFT to `(2, 1)`, they are safe.\n\n**2. Analyze Strategy (Apple Acquisition):**\n*   **Apple at (2, 6):** Distance 3.\n*   **Apple at (9, 4):** Distance 8.\n*   **Apple at (8, 0):** Distance 7.\n*   **Apple at (9, 7):** Distance 11.\n*   **Apple at (5, 8):** Distance 7.\n*   The apple at `(2, 6)` is the primary target. To get there, I need to move UP and RIGHT.\n\n**3. Move Evaluation:**\n*   **UP (to 1, 5):** Moves towards the (2, 6) apple. Reduces Manhattan distance from 3 to 2. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (to 2, 4):** Moves towards the (2, 6) apple. Reduces Manhattan distance from 3 to 2. Safe. However, this moves me to X=2, which is the same X coordinate as the enemy snake's head (X=3). If the enemy moves LEFT to (2, 1) and I move RIGHT to (2, 4), we are on the same X-axis but far apart. The main concern is if I go to (2, 4) and then later need to go to (2, 5) or (2, 6), I am on the X=2 column.\n*   **LEFT (to 0, 4):** Moves away from the apple. Distance increases to 4. Not ideal.\n*   **DOWN (to 1, 3):** Moves away from the apple. Distance increases to 4. Not ideal.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT:\n*   **UP** keeps me at X=1.\n*   **RIGHT** moves me to X=2.\n*   The enemy is at X=3. If I stay at X=1, I am safely away from the enemy's column. If I move to X=2, I am adjacent. While the enemy is currently at Y=1, moving to X=2 limits my escape routes to the left (only to X=1, which is where I came from).\n*   Therefore, **UP** is the better move to maintain positional security while approaching the apple.\n\nI will move UP.\n\nLong-term plan: Go for the apple at (2, 6). From (1, 5), I will likely need to move RIGHT to (2, 5) and then UP to (2, 6). Be careful of the enemy at (3, 1).\n\nUP",

Body: (3,6), (2,6), (1,6).\n           Next turn, I can go UP to (3,7), etc.\n           Geometrically, moving UP or RIGHT are symmetric choices regarding the target (5,8).\n           However, looking at the board, there is an apple at (9,7).\n           If I go UP, I am at Y=7.\n           If I go RIGHT, I am at Y=6.\n           Target (5,8) is at Y=8.\n           Target (9,7) is at Y=7.\n           Target (9,4) is at Y=4.\n           Target (8,0) is at Y=0.\n           Target (9,9) is at Y=9.\n           Most apples are in the upper half.\n           Moving UP is generally safer for the \"upper half\" strategy.\n           Let's check for traps.\n           Current body: (2,6), (1,6), (1,5).\n           If I go UP to (2,7):\n             Next moves: RIGHT (3,7), LEFT (1,7), UP (2,8), DOWN (2,6) [Blocked by self].\n             So 3 options.\n           If I go RIGHT to (3,6):\n             Next moves: UP (3,7), DOWN (3,5), RIGHT (4,6), LEFT (2,6) [Blocked by self].\n             So 3 options.\n           Both leave 3 options.\n           Both move towards apples.\n           Let's look at the snake #1 at (4,1).\n           If I go UP, I am further away from him. Safe.\n           If I go RIGHT, I am moving towards X=4. He is at X=4, Y=1. I am at Y=6. Distance is large.\n           Let's check the board again.\n           Row 6: `. T 0 . . . . . . .`\n           Row 7: `. . . . . . . . . .`\n           Row 5: `. T . . . . . . . .`\n           (1,5) is tail. (1,6) is tail.\n           If I go UP to (2,7), I am clear.\n           If I go RIGHT to (3,6), I am clear.\n           I will choose UP. Why? Because moving UP puts me at Y=7, which matches the apple at (9,7). It's a good coordinate to hold.\n\nDecision:\nMove UP to (2, 7). This moves me closer to the apples at (5, 8) and (9, 7). It is safe.\n\nPlan:\nMove UP to (2, 7) to align with the upper cluster of apples. From there, I will turn RIGHT towards (5, 8).\nUP",

Immediate Safety Analysis**\nMy head is at (5, 8). The previous turn I moved RIGHT to get here and ate an apple (implied, though the prompt lists the apple at (5,8) as still present, I will assume I successfully ate it and grew, or that the apple is there for this turn's logic. The prompt says \"Apples at: ... (9, 7), (8, 0), (9, 4), (9, 9), (9, 2)\". The apple at (5,8) is NOT listed in the current apple list. This means I successfully ate it last turn. My body is now likely [(5,8) -> head, (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8) or similar tail movement]. Wait, the prompt explicitly states: \"Body: [(4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8)]\" and \"Head: (5, 8)\". This matches the *state after my move*. The tail is at (2, 8). So I didn't grow? Or the tail moved? \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\". If I ate at (5,8), the tail should NOT have moved from last turn. The prompt says \"Your last move information: ... RIGHT\". So I moved from (4,8) to (5,8). If (5,8) had an apple, I grow. The list of apples in the header does NOT include (5,8). So I definitely ate it. But the body list provided is exactly [(4,8), (3,8), (2,8)]. This implies the tail is at (2,8). If I grew, the tail should stay at (2,8) (if it was at (1,8) before). Let's trust the provided state: Head (5,8), Body [(4,8), (3,8), (2,8)].\n\nLet's evaluate moves from (5,8):\n- **LEFT to (4, 8):** This is my own body. **DEADLY.**\n- **UP to (5, 9):** Valid. Board shows row 9 has an apple at (9,9). (5,9) is empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN to (5, 7):** Valid. Row 7 has an apple at (9,7). (5,7) is empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (6, 8):** Valid. Empty. Safe.\n\n**3. Enemy Analysis**\n- **Snake #1:** Head at (4, 2). Body: none.\n- The enemy is far away (Y=2 vs Y=8). They cannot reach me this turn.\n- They are directly below my old position (4,8) -> (4,2). Distance is 6 units. Safe.\n\n**4. Strategy & Move Evaluation**\n- **Goal:** Maximize apples and survival. Currently at 3 apples.\n- **Apple Locations:**\n  - (9, 7): Top right, 4 steps away (Right 3, Up -1).\n  - (9, 4): Top right, 4 steps away (Right 4, Up -4).\n  - (9, 2): Top right, 5 steps away (Right 5, Up -6).\n  - (9, 9): Top right, 4 steps away (Right 4, Up 1).\n  - (8, 0): Bottom right, far away.\n- **Direction Analysis:**\n  - **LEFT:** Blocked by own body. Invalid.\n  - **UP (5, 9):** Moves me to the top row. This puts me closer to (9,9) and (9,7). However, (5,9) is on the edge. If I go UP, I am at y=9. My next moves will be restricted to DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. This is a \"dead end\" risk because I can't go UP anymore. Also, I might get trapped against the wall. However, it gets me closer to the cluster of apples at the top right.\n  - **DOWN (5, 7):** Moves me down. This puts me closer to the apple at (9,7) (distance 4). But moving DOWN takes me away from (9,9) and (9,4). It also moves me slightly closer to the enemy snake at (4,2), but he is still far. Moving DOWN reduces my vertical mobility (I am at y=7, can still go up to 8, but I just came from 8). It's safer than UP because I am not on the edge.\n  - **RIGHT (6, 8):** Moves Right. This is the most versatile direction. It moves me towards all right-side apples. It keeps me at y=8, which is not the edge, allowing UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT moves. It maintains access to both top and bottom right apples.\n\n- **Comparing UP vs RIGHT vs DOWN:**\n  - **UP:** High risk of getting trapped on the top wall. Limited future moves.\n  - **DOWN:** Moves away from the concentration of apples at the top right.\n  - **RIGHT:** Moves directly towards the \"rich\" area (right side). Keeps options open. Highest safety.\n\n- **Decision:** Move RIGHT. It is the standard \"drift\" towards the resources while maintaining central flexibility.\n- **Safety Check for RIGHT (6, 8):** Empty. Safe.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Head towards the cluster of apples at (9,7), (9,9), (9,4). Avoid the top wall until necessary. Monitor enemy (4,2).\n**END RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

Based on the board state and the last move being RIGHT, my head is now at (9, 8).\n\nCurrent Head: (9, 8)\nBody: [(8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8)]\n\n1.  **LEFT (8, 8):** This is the immediate cell behind my head, occupied by my body. Moving here results in death. **Invalid.**\n2.  **UP (9, 9):** This cell contains an apple. It is at the top-right corner of the board. Moving here is safe (assuming no enemy collision).\n3.  **DOWN (9, 7):** This cell contains an apple. It is valid and safe.\n4.  **RIGHT:** This would be x=10, which is off the board. **Invalid.**\n\n**Comparison of Safe Moves:**\n-   **UP (9, 9):** Moves to the corner. If I am at (9, 9), my only valid moves next turn would be LEFT or DOWN (since I cannot go UP or RIGHT). While slightly restrictive, it secures an apple.\n-   **DOWN (9, 7):** Moves to an interior cell. This maintains flexibility as I can still move UP or DOWN in future turns.\n\n**Strategic Plan:**\nMy goal is to maximize apple collection while staying alive. Both UP and DOWN contain apples. I am currently at y=8. If I move DOWN to (9, 7), I will be at y=7. This is an interior row (y=1 to y=8 are interior since y=9 is the boundary), leaving all 4 directions valid for the next move (except potentially if I hit a wall or obstacle). Moving UP to (9, 9) puts me in the corner, limiting my next move to only LEFT or DOWN. Because both moves guarantee an apple, and the DOWN move provides better positional flexibility (keeping me away from the corner until necessary), the safer and more flexible play is DOWN.\n\n**Decision:** Move DOWN to (9, 7) to eat the apple while maintaining better board control.\n\nDOWN",

The text description claims the head is at (9, 8), but the visual board clearly shows the head '0' at (8, 7) and the body segments connecting to the right and up. I will trust the visual board.\n\nMy current position is (8, 7). The body is at (8, 8), (7, 8), and (6, 8).\nLet's evaluate the moves:\n\n1.  **UP (8, 8):** The visual board shows `(8, 8)` as part of my body ('T'). Moving UP would result in a collision with my own body. **Invalid.**\n2.  **RIGHT (9, 7):** The visual board shows an apple 'A' at `(9, 7)`. The path is clear. **Valid.**\n3.  **LEFT (7, 7):** The cell `(7, 7)` is empty. **Valid.**\n4.  **DOWN (8, 6):** The cell `(8, 6)` is empty. **Valid.**\n\n**Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 7):** This moves me to a column at the edge of the board (x=9). I will collect an apple and grow. Next turn, I will be at (9, 7), with my body trailing behind me at (8, 7). I will be unable to move RIGHT.\n*   **LEFT to (7, 7):** Moves me into the open center. No apple.\n*   **DOWN to (8, 6):** Moves me into the open bottom area. No apple.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI currently have 3 apples. The target is 50. I should prioritize collecting apples. There is an apple at (9, 7) which is adjacent to my head. Taking this apple is the most efficient move. While moving to the edge limits future movement slightly, having an apple there is a good resource to claim. My body is currently mostly in row 8, so moving to row 7 keeps me relatively safe.\n\nThe enemy snake is far away at (3, 1), posing no immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, moving **RIGHT** to collect the apple at (9, 7) is the best choice.\n\nRIGHT",
