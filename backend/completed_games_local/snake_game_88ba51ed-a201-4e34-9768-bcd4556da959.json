It moves me closer to the clusters of apples at (7, 3), (8, 5), and (2, 0).

It avoids the immediate congestion of my body segments at (4, 6) and (4, 5) while navigating towards the center-right where multiple apples are located ((8, 5), (7, 3), (9, 6)).

It is likely to move towards the center or towards me. By moving RIGHT (4, 4) or DOWN (3, 3), I maintain distance. The apple at (7, 3) is a good target. The apple at (2, 0) is also viable, but necessitates moving through the bottom-left area where the enemy might descend.\n\nDecision:\nRIGHT (4, 4) allows me to clear my own body segments at x=4 and sets me up for a path toward the cluster of apples on the right side of the board ((7, 3), (8, 5), (9, 6)). This direction maximizes my future space and avoids potential interference with Snake 0's path to (2, 0).\n\nFuture Plan:\nMove toward (7, 3) or (8, 5). Watch Snake 0's movement; if it commits to the bottom left for (2, 0), I have the right side of the board to myself.\n\nRIGHT",

RIGHT: (6, 4). Safe. Moves towards apple at (7, 3).\n\nAnalysis:\nSnake 0 is at (2, 4) and its body is trailing upwards. Its available moves are:\n- UP: (2, 5) - **Death** (into its own body).\n- DOWN: (2, 3). Safe.\n- LEFT: (1, 4). Safe.\n- RIGHT: (3, 4) - **Death** (into my body). \nSnake 0 is forced to go LEFT or DOWN. This means there is no risk of a head-on collision if I move into the 4th or 5th x-columns.\n\nStrategic Evaluation:\nThe nearest apples are at (7, 3) and (8, 5).\n- Moving RIGHT (6, 4) puts me 2 steps from (7, 3) and 3 steps from (8, 5).\n- Moving UP (5, 5) puts me 3 steps from (8, 5).\n- Moving DOWN (5, 3) puts me 2 steps from (7, 3).\n\nMoving RIGHT is the most flexible move. It creates more distance from Snake 0, maintains central positioning, and allows me to react to whichever apple remains safest to grab on the next turn.\n\nLong-term plan:\nTarget (7, 3) first, then pivot to (8, 5) or (9, 6). Snake 0 is constrained on the left side of the board for now. I will maximize my score while it is stuck navigating its own tail and the left edge.\n\nRIGHT",

Next turn I can go DOWN to get (7, 3).\n- If I move DOWN to (6, 3), I am at (6, 3). Next turn I can go RIGHT to get (7, 3).\n\nRIGHT (7, 4) is slightly better because it maintains height, keeping me closer to the cluster of apples at (8, 5) and (9, 6) while still being able to drop down for (7, 3) or (9, 1).

It positions me between the enemy and the majority of the food.\n- DOWN is also safe but slightly less optimal for reaching the (8, 5) and (9, 6) cluster quickly.\n- LEFT moves toward the enemy, which is unnecessary given the score lead.\n\nLong-term plan:\nMove RIGHT to (8, 3). Then target the apple at (8, 5) or (9, 1) depending on how the enemy moves. I intend to clear the right side of the board while keeping my body from cutting myself off from the center.\n\nRIGHT",

My current body blocks a direct path for Snake 0 to the right side of the board.\n- Moving UP to (8, 4) puts me 1 step away from (8, 5) and creates a path toward the top-right cluster (8, 8) and (9, 6).\n- Moving DOWN to (8, 2) puts me 1 step away from (7, 2). However, moving down might crowd my tail or put me in a position where Snake 0 can intercept more easily.\n\nStrategic Evaluation:\nUP is a strong move. It targets (8, 5) immediately and keeps me in the open upper-right quadrant where three apples currently reside.\n\nLong-term plan:\nMove UP to (8, 4) to grab the apple at (8, 5). From there, continue upward to (8, 8) or sweep right to (9, 6). This strategy keeps the snake away from the enemy and focuses on the high-density apple area.\n\nUP",
