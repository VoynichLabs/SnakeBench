Board Analysis:**\n*   **Board Size:** 10x10 (Coordinates 0-9).\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at (8, 2), Body []. No tail, so I don't need to worry about running into myself except for the immediate \"backwards\" rule.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (4, 8), Body [].\n*   **Apples:**\n    *   (8, 0): Directly South of my head. Distance: 2.\n    *   (9, 0): Southeast of my head. Distance: 3.\n    *   (5, 9): Northwest relative to enemy, far from me.\n    *   (0, 1) & (3, 0): Far Left/Bottom.\n\n**2. Move Evaluation (Safety & Strategy):**\n\n*   **Current Position:** (8, 2).\n*   **Option: UP** (to 8, 3)\n    *   Safe: Yes. Open space.\n    *   Strategic: Moves away from the closest apples ((8,0) and (9,0)). Generally less optimal right now as I want to secure points quickly.\n*   **Option: DOWN** (to 8, 1)\n    *   Safe: Yes. Open space.\n    *   Strategic: Moves me directly toward the apple at (8,0) and closer to (9,0). This is a strong direction.\n*   **Option: LEFT** (to 7, 2)\n    *   Safe: Yes. Open space.\n    *   Strategic: Moves away from the bottom-right apples. Not ideal.\n*   **Option: RIGHT** (to 9, 2)\n    *   Safe: Yes. Open space (Wall at x=9 is a boundary, but (9,2) is valid).\n    *   Strategic: Moves away from (8,0), heads toward (9,0) indirectly. Not as direct as DOWN.\n\n**3. Enemy & Long-term Considerations:**\n*   The enemy snake (ID 0) is at (4, 8). They are far away and currently pose no immediate collision threat for the next turn or two.\n*   The apple at (8, 0) is the closest target (2 moves away).\n*   The apple at (9, 0) is also very close.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move **DOWN** to (8, 1). This moves me 1 step closer to the apple at (8, 0). On the following turn, if the path remains clear, I can move DOWN again to (8, 0) to eat the apple and grow. This is the most efficient path to my first point.\n\n**Strategy Plan for Next Turn:**\nSecure the apple at (8, 0) by moving DOWN now. After eating, assess the safety of moving to (9, 0) or (9, 1) to continue scoring. Monitor enemy position to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nDOWN",

Plan for Next Turn:**\nAfter eating the apple at (8, 0), the head will be at (8, 0) and the tail will be at (8, 1) (the current head position).\nIn the next turn, I will likely want to eat the apple at (9, 0).

UP from (5, 9) is (5, 10) \u2192 off board \u2192 death. So only LEFT to (4, 9) or RIGHT to (6, 9) would be safe next turn. Both are inside board and likely safe unless enemy moves there.  \n\n**Alternative: delay eating?**  \nIf I go LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT now, I avoid eating apple this turn but stay length 1. That keeps all moves open next turn from the new position, but enemy might eat (5, 9) next turn if they move there. Enemy at (8, 1) is far, so unlikely to reach (5, 9) in 2 turns unless they move toward it aggressively. Still, no reason to delay \u2014 eating now gives me an apple lead and growth.  \n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (5, 9), my body will be at (5, 8), head at (5, 9). Next turn, avoid DOWN (into body) and UP (off board). Only LEFT to (4, 9) or RIGHT to (6, 9) are possible. Choose whichever is safer considering enemy position then.

Since I grew last turn (at turn 4), my tail at (8, 1) is clearing this turn.\n*   **Enemy Position (Snake 0):** Head at (4, 7), Body: [(4, 8)].\n*   **Apples:** (0, 1), (3, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 3).\n*   **Board Context:** I am currently moving away from the right wall towards the center. My previous body positions at (9, 1) and (9, 0) are still occupied this turn, but (8, 1) will be empty.\n\n**2. Move Evaluation (Head at (8, 1)):**\n*   **UP:** (8, 2). This is a valid, empty cell. Safe.\n*   **DOWN:** (8, 0). This is currently occupied by my own body (specifically, the tail segment that hasn't cleared yet). Collision/Death. *Correction:* Looking at the previous state, the tail was at (8, 1). The body is [(9, 1), (9, 0)]. Wait, let me re-check the previous state provided in the prompt.\n    *   Previous Prompt State: \"Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)]\", \"Tail: (8, 1)\". This implies the body list given might be incomplete or I am misunderstanding the list ordering. Usually, the list is [Head, Segments..., Tail].\n    *   Let's re-read: \"Snake 1 ... Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)]\". Wait, if the head is (8,1) now, and I moved LEFT from (9,1), then the old head was (9,1).\n    *   Old State: Head (9,1), Body [(9,0), (8,0)]? No, prompt said \"Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)]\". Wait, the prompt said \"Head: (8, 1)\" and \"Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)]\". This is confusing.\n    *   Let's look at the \"Last Move\" info from the prompt. It says: \"My Position (Snake 1): Head at (9, 1). Body: [(9, 0), (8, 0)]. ... I grew last turn, so my tail (8, 1) will clear this turn.\"\n    *   So, before the move, the snake was: Head (9,1), Body [(9,0), (8,0)]. Tail was (8,1)? No, if the body list is [(9,0), (8,0)], then the tail is (8,0). But the text says \"my tail (8,1) will clear\".\n    *   Let's trust the text description of the *previous* turn's outcome: \"Head at (9, 1). Body: [(9, 0), (8, 0)]\". If I moved LEFT to (8,1), then the new head is (8,1). The body becomes (9,1). The tail remains (8,0) (if the list was actually [(9,0), (8,0)])? No, the text explicitly says \"Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)]\" in the *current* turn description? No, the *Current Turn* description (Top of prompt) says: \"Head: (8, 1), Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)]\". This implies the tail is (9,0) right now? No, that would be a very short snake. Let's look at the Board State visual.\n    *   Board State Visual:\n        Row 1: `A A . . . . . . 1 T`\n        Row 0: `. . . A . . . . . T`\n        The `1` is at x=8, y=1.\n        The `T` (tail) is at x=9, y=1 and x=9, y=0?\n        Actually, the board shows `1` at (8,1) and `T` at (9,1) and `T` at (9,0).\n        If the Head is (8,1), then (9,1) is the next segment. (9,0) is the next. Where is the tail?\n        The text says Body: [(9,1), (9,0)]. This implies the snake is 3 segments long (Head + 2 Body).\n        If I grew last turn, the tail *was* at (8,1) but moved. Wait, if I moved Left from (9,1) to (8,1), the old head (9,1) becomes body.\n        Let's look at the \"Last Move\" info again carefully. It says \"Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)]\". This *is* the current state provided by the user at the top.\n        Wait, the user says \"Your snake (ID 1): Head: (8, 1), Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)]\".\n        This means the segments are: (8,1) -> (9,1) -> (9,0).\n        That's a 3-segment snake. A 2-segment body implies a 3-segment snake total.\n        Since I grew last turn, the tail *did not* clear. The tail is at (9,0).\n        However, the \"Last Move Rationale\" (written by the user/system) says: \"I grew last turn, so my tail (8, 1) will clear this turn.\"\n        This is a contradiction between the Board State/Current Stats and the Last Move Rationale text.\n        BUT, usually, in these games, if you eat, you grow *after* the move. So if I ate on turn 4, I grew on turn 4. The tail stays put during turn 4. On turn 5, the tail moves.\n        If the \"Last Move Rationale\" says \"my tail (8,1) will clear\", it implies the tail *was* at (8,1) before the move, and *now* (turn 5) it will disappear.\n        But the *Current State* provided says Body is [(9,1), (9,0)].\n        Let's assume the visual board and the \"Current State\" list are the source of truth for where physical objects are.\n        Visual: (8,1) is Head '1'. (9,1) is 'T'. (9,0) is 'T'.\n        If the list is [(9,1), (9,0)], that means the body connects to (9,1) then (9,0). The tail is (9,0).\n        If the tail is (9,0), then the cell (9,0) is about to become empty (if I didn't grow this turn).\n        Did I grow this turn? I ate on turn 4 (the Rationale says \"I grew last turn\").\n        So, if I ate on turn 4, I grew. My tail length increased.\n        On turn 5 (current), I am moving. If I eat again, I grow. If I don't, my tail moves after I move.\n        If I did *not* grow on this turn (yet), then my tail will move forward.\n        The \"Last Move Rationale\" says \"my tail (8,1) will clear\". This implies the tail *was* (8,1).\n        Let's look at the \"Last Move\" board description:\n        \"Head: (9, 1), Body: [(9, 0), (8, 0)]\" (Wait, the rationale text says \"Body: [(9, 0), (8, 0)]\"? No, it says \"Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)]\" in the main header, and in the Last Move block it says \"Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)]\". Wait, the last move block says \"Current State... Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)]\".\n        Let's re-read the prompt's \"Your snake\" section:\n        \"Head: (8, 1), Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)]\".\n        Visual Board: Row 1 has `T` at (9,1). Row 0 has `T` at (9,0).\n        So the snake is: (8,1) -> (9,1) -> (9,0).\n        Total length = 3.\n        Since I have 2 apples, length should be 3 (Head + 2). Correct.\n        Did I eat on turn 4? \"My last move information... LEFT\". Rationale says \"I grew last turn\". Yes.\n        So, I ate on turn 4. I grew.\n        On turn 5 (now), I am moving.\n        If I do *not* eat on turn 5, my tail will move forward.\n        The tail is (9,0). The segment in front of it is (9,1).\n        So if I move and don't eat, (9,0) becomes empty.\n        The \"Last Move Rationale\" saying \"my tail (8,1) will clear\" is likely referring to the state *before* the move described in the rationale. The rationale describes the decision for turn 4.\n        So, for Turn 5:\n        Current Head: (8,1).\n        Current Body: [(9,1), (9,0)].\n        Current Tail: (9,0).\n        So, (9,0) is the tail. It might clear *after* my move this turn.\n\n**3. Move Evaluation (Current Head at (8, 1)):**\n*   **UP:** (8, 2). Board shows `.` (Empty). Safe.\n*   **DOWN:** (8, 0). Board shows `.` (Empty). Safe. (The old tail (9,0) is distinct from (8,0)).\n*   **LEFT:** (7, 1). Board shows `.` (Empty). Safe.\n*   **RIGHT:** (9, 1). Board shows `T` (Tail). This is currently occupied by my body. Collision. **DEADLY.**\n\n**4. Strategic Decision:**\nI have 3 safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n*   **DOWN (8,0):** Moves towards the apple at (3,0) and (1,1). This seems like the most direct path to the cluster of apples at the bottom. However, let's look at the Board visual for Row 0. `. . . A . . . . . T`. The 'T' is at (9,0). The apple is at (3,0). Moving to (8,0) puts me on the bottom row. This is okay.\n*   **LEFT (7,1):** Moves towards the apple at (3,0) and (1,1) as well. Also safe.\n*   **UP (8,2):** Moves towards the apple at (1,4) or (2,3). This is a different direction.\n\nWhich direction is better?\nApples are at: (0,1), (3,0), (1,1), (1,4), (2,3).\nMy current position is (8,1).\nDistance to (3,0) via DOWN: `|8-3| + |1-0| = 5 + 1 = 6`. (Moving DOWN to (8,0), then LEFT...).\nDistance to (3,0) via LEFT: `|8-3| + |1-0| = 5 + 1 = 6`.\nDistance to (1,1) via DOWN: `|8-1| + |1-1| = 7`.\nDistance to (1,1) via LEFT: `|8-1| + |1-1| = 7`.\nDistance to (0,1) via DOWN: `|8-0| + |1-1| = 8`.\nDistance to (0,1) via LEFT: `|8-0| + |1-1| = 8`.\n\nThey seem similar. However, the enemy snake is at (4,7). The apples at (1,4) and (2,3) are closer to the enemy (and generally higher up). The bottom row apples (3,0) and (1,1) are safer from the enemy.\nAlso, moving DOWN to (8,0) puts me on the edge of the board. I can only go UP, LEFT, or (if I'm at x=0) RIGHT. At (8,0), I can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT (though RIGHT is blocked by my tail for now).\nMoving LEFT to (7,1) keeps me in row 1, which allows UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT (mostly).\nActually, let's look at the board visual again.\nRow 0: `. . . A . . . . . T`. (Apple at 3,0).\nRow 1: `A A . . . . . . 1 T`. (Apples at 0,1, 1,1). Head at 8,1.\nRow 2: `. . . . . . . . . .`.\nIf I go DOWN to (8,0), I am at (8,0). Next turn I can go LEFT to (7,0), then (6,0)... eventually to (3,0). Or I can go UP to (8,1) (but that will be filled by body next turn? No, if I go DOWN, my body follows).\nIf I go LEFT to (7,1), I am at (7,1). Next turn I can go LEFT to (6,1), or DOWN to (7,0).\nThe apple at (3,0) is blocked by nothing. The apples at (0,1) and (1,1) are blocked by nothing.\nThe enemy is at (4,7). If the enemy rushes down, it could be dangerous.\nHowever, my priority is to eat apples to grow and win.\nThe bottom apples are \"free\" (no enemy nearby).\nLet's look at the \"Rules and win conditions\" about \"Head-on collision\".\nThe enemy is at (4,7). If I go DOWN to (8,0), I am moving away from the enemy. If I go LEFT to (7,1), I am moving slightly towards the center but still far.\n\nIs there any trap?\nIf I go DOWN to (8,0):\nTurn 6: I am at (8,0). My tail (9,0) will have cleared.\nTurn 6 options: LEFT (7,0) -> Towards apple. UP (8,1) -> Safe. RIGHT (9,0) -> Safe (empty now).\nIf I go LEFT to (7,1):\nTurn 6: I am at (7,1). My tail (9,0) clears? Wait, if I didn't eat, tail moves.\nIf I go DOWN, I am closer to the apple at (3,0) by 1 step vertically. If I go LEFT, I am closer by 1 step horizontally.\nActually, let's look at the board visual again.\nRow 0: `. . . A ...`\nRow 1: `A A ...`\nIf I go DOWN, I am at (8,0). I am now \"under\" my body (which will be at (8,1) and (9,1)). This is fine.\nIf I go LEFT, I am at (7,1). I am \"left\" of my body (which will be at (8,1) and (9,1)).\nBoth seem perfectly fine.\nIs there any reason to prefer one?\nIf I go DOWN, I might eventually want to turn LEFT at (3,0) (the apple).\nIf I go LEFT, I might eventually want to turn DOWN at (1,1) or (0,1).\nThe apple at (3,0) is the most \"central\" bottom apple.\nLet's consider the enemy.\nEnemy is at (4,7). Enemy has body [(4,8)].\nThe enemy has 1 apple. It might move towards apples.\nAre there apples near (4,7)? (1,4), (2,3). Yes.\nThe enemy is likely to go DOWN or LEFT/RIGHT.\nIf the enemy goes DOWN, it goes to (4,6).\nIf I go DOWN, I go to (8,0). We are moving away from each other.\nIf I go LEFT, I go to (7,1). We are moving away from each other.\nActually, let's look at the \"scores\".\nMy score: 2. Enemy score: 1.\nI am winning.\nI should play safe.\nMoving DOWN to the bottom row (y=0) is generally safer than moving into the middle (y=1), because I can only be attacked from x-direction (LEFT/RIGHT) but not from y-direction (UP/DOWN) if I am at the bottom wall? No, that's not true. If I am at (8,0), an enemy can come from (8,1) or (7,1) or (9,1) (but 9,1 is my body).\nActually, if I am at the bottom wall, I have fewer escape routes. If I get trapped, I die.\nIf I am in the middle (y=1), I have more options (UP or DOWN).\nSo, maybe staying in the middle (going LEFT) is better for survival than going DOWN to the wall?\nLet's re-evaluate.\nIf I go LEFT to (7,1):\nI am at y=1. Next turn I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or (if x=9) RIGHT.\nIf I go DOWN to (8,0):\nI am at y=0. Next turn I can only go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\nHowever, the bottom row has apples at (3,0) and (1,1).\nWait, (1,1) is at y=1.\nSo if I go DOWN to (8,0), I can't reach (1,1) directly.\nTo reach (1,1) from (8,0), I have to go UP at some point.\nTo reach (3,0) from (8,0), I can just go LEFT.\nTo reach (3,0) from (7,1), I have to go DOWN then LEFT.\nTo reach (1,1) from (7,1), I have to go LEFT then DOWN? No, (1,1) is at y=1, x=1.\nFrom (7,1), I can go LEFT all the way to (1,1). That seems efficient.\nFrom (8,1) (current), (1,1) is 7 steps left.\nFrom (8,0), to get to (1,1), I need to go UP to (8,1), then LEFT. (8,1) will be occupied by my body if I go DOWN. Wait, if I go DOWN to (8,0), my body moves to (8,1). So (8,1) will be blocked. I would have to go LEFT from (8,0) to (7,0), then UP to (7,1).\nSo, if I go DOWN, I am committed to the bottom row until I loop around or find a gap.\nIf I go LEFT, I stay at y=1, which is open to both y=0 and y=2.\nThe cluster of apples is at the bottom left.\n(3,0), (1,1), (0,1). (1,1) and (0,1) are on y=1.\nSo, staying on y=1 seems logical to access these apples.\nAlso, the apple at (1,4) is at y=4.\nIf I stay at y=1, I can go UP later if I want.\nIf I go DOWN to y=0, I have to climb back up.\nTherefore, **LEFT** seems like the better move to keep options open and stay aligned with the (0,1) and (1,1) apples.\n\nWait, let's check the board visual for Row 1 again.\nRow 1: `A A . . . . . . 1 T`\nApples at 0,1 and 1,1.\nI am at 8,1.\nIf I move LEFT, I go to 7,1.\nThen 6,1, 5,1... eventually 1,1.\nThis is a straight line to (1,1).\nIf I move DOWN, I go to 8,0.\nThen I can go LEFT to 7,0, 6,0... to 3,0.\nThen I have to turn UP or LEFT.\nIf I turn UP at 3,0, I go to 3,1.\nThen I can go LEFT to 2,1, 1,1.\nSo both paths are valid.\nHowever, the path LEFT is a straight line to the apples at (1,1) and (0,1). The path DOWN leads to (3,0), then requires a turn.\nAlso, if I go LEFT, I can easily pivot to (3,0) by going DOWN later at (3,1) (if clear).\nIf I go DOWN, pivoting to (1,1) requires going LEFT then UP.\nMoving LEFT seems slightly more flexible.\n\nIs there any danger?\nThe enemy is at (4,7).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (4,6), then DOWN to (4,5)...\nI am at (8,1) (or 7,1).\nWe are far apart.\nHead-on collision risk is low.\n\nLet's double check the \"Turn 5 / 150\".\nThe \"Last Move\" was \"LEFT\" (Turn 4).\nCurrent Head: (8,1).\nMy body: [(9,1), (9,0)].\nIf I move LEFT to (7,1):\nNew Head: (7,1).\nNew Body: [(8,1), (9,1)].\nNew Tail: (9,0).\nThis is a valid move.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8,0):\nNew Head: (8,0).\nNew Body: [(8,1), (9,1)].\nNew Tail: (9,0).\nThis is also valid.\n\nIf I move UP to (8,2):\nNew Head: (8,2).\nNew Body: [(8,1), (9,1)].\nNew Tail: (9,0).\nAlso valid.\n\nLet's consider the \"Rules and win conditions\".\n\"Your last move information... START LAST MOVE PICK ... LEFT ... END\"\nThis confirms I moved LEFT on Turn 4.\nThe prompt says \"My Position (Snake 1): Head: (8, 1). Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)]. Apples collected: 2\".\nWait, if I have 2 apples and length 3, I have grown twice (Head + 2).\nIf I ate on Turn 4, I grew.\nIf I eat on Turn 5, I grow again.\nLet's look at the apples.\nApples at: (0, 1), (3, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 3).\nIf I go LEFT to (7,1), I am not eating.\nIf I go DOWN to (8,0), I am not eating.\nIf I go UP to (8,2), I am not eating.\nWait, the board visual shows `(1, 1)` as an apple. My current head is (8,1).\nIf I go LEFT, I get closer to (1,1).\nIf I go DOWN, I go to (8,0). There is an apple at (3,0) and (0,1) and (1,1).\nActually, the board visual row 0 has an apple at x=3. Row 1 has apples at x=0 and x=1.\n\nLet's think about the enemy.\nSnake #0: Head (4,7).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN, it goes to (4,6).\nIf I move LEFT, I go to (7,1).\nIf I move DOWN, I go to (8,0).\nThe enemy has an apple at (1,4), (2,3) nearby.\nIt's unlikely the enemy will rush me immediately.\nHowever, I must be careful of \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\"\nThe enemy is at x=4. I am at x=8. Distance is 4.\nIf we both move towards each other, we won't meet this turn.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT (x=3), I move RIGHT (x=9), we are still far.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN (y=6), I move UP (y=2), we are far.\nSo head-on collision is not a risk this turn.\n\nLet's look at the \"Scores\".\nSnake 1: 2 apples.\nSnake 0: 1 apple.\nI am winning.\nI should play safe.\nGetting trapped is the main risk.\nIf I go DOWN to the bottom row (y=0), I limit my movement.\nIf I go LEFT at y=1, I am in the \"middle\" (vertically), so I can go UP or DOWN.\nHowever, y=0 is the bottom. y=9 is the top.\ny=1 is effectively the 2nd row from bottom.\nGoing DOWN to y=0 reduces my vertical freedom from 2 options (UP/DOWN) to 1 (UP).\nGoing LEFT to x=7 keeps my vertical freedom.\n\nIs there an apple immediately reachable?\nRow 1: `A A ...`\nApples are at x=0,1.\nI am at x=8.\nDistance is 7 moves.\nIf I go LEFT every turn, I will reach (1,1) in 6 turns (7->6->5->4->3->2->1).\nIf I go DOWN, I go to (8,0). To get to (1,1), I need to go LEFT to (1,0) then UP to (1,1).\nDistance to (1,1) via DOWN: 1 (DOWN) + 7 (LEFT) + 1 (UP) = 9 moves.\nDistance to (3,0) via DOWN: 1 (DOWN) + 5 (LEFT) = 6 moves.\nDistance to (3,0) via LEFT: 5 (LEFT) + 1 (DOWN) = 6 moves.\nDistance to (0,1) via DOWN: 1 (DOWN) + 8 (LEFT) + 1 (UP) = 10 moves.\nDistance to (0,1) via LEFT: 8 (LEFT) = 8 moves.\nDistance to (1,1) via LEFT: 7 moves.\n\nSo, moving LEFT is strictly better for reaching (0,1) and (1,1). It is equal for reaching (3,0). It is better for reaching the cluster of 3 apples (0,1, 1,1, 3,0).\nTherefore, **LEFT** is the optimal move.\n\nWait, I must check if I am going backwards.\nMy head is (8,1). My neck is (9,1).\nLEFT is (7,1). This is not backwards.\nDOWN is (8,0). Not backwards.\nUP is (8,2). Not backwards.\nRIGHT is (9,1). This IS backwards (into my body).\n\nSo, LEFT, DOWN, UP are candidates.\nLEFT wins on strategy.\n\nLet me write the plan.\n\"Plan: Navigate left towards the apples at (1,1) and (0,1). Keep an eye on the enemy at (4,7) and avoid potential collisions. Use the bottom row (y=0) only if necessary to avoid obstacles.\"\n\nWait, the prompt asks me to \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns.\"\nAnd \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\nSo I need to write the plan, then the move.\n\nFinal check:\nBoard:\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . T . . . . .\n7 . . . . 0 . . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . A . . . . . . . .\n3 . . A . . . . . . .\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 A A . . . . . . 1 T\n0 . . . A . . . . . T\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nHead at (8,1).\nIf I move LEFT, I go to (7,1).\n(7,1) is empty.\nMy body becomes (8,1) and (9,1). Tail (9,0) stays (assuming no grow) or moves?\nIf I don't eat, tail moves from (9,0). Where does it go? To (9,1).\nSo if I move LEFT:\nHead: (7,1)\nBody: [(8,1), (9,1)]\nTail: (9,0) -> disappears?\nWait, if the body is (8,1) and (9,1), and the snake is length 3, then the tail is (9,1).\nWait, if the snake is length 3: Head, Body, Tail.\nCurrent: Head (8,1), Body (9,1), Tail (9,0).\nMove LEFT: Head (7,1), Body (8,1), Tail (9,1).\nSo (9,0) becomes empty.\nThis is correct.\n(9,1) is now the tail.\n(9,0) becomes empty.\nSo I don't collide with my own tail.\n\nOkay, solid.\n\nOne more check. Is there a trap?\nIf I go LEFT, I am going into the center of the board.\nThe enemy is at (4,7).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN, I am safe.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT, I am safe.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN and LEFT, I am safe.\nWe are far apart.\n\nWhat about the apple at (1,4) and (2,3)?\nIf the enemy wants those, they will go DOWN.\nIf I go LEFT, I am going towards (1,1) etc.\nWe are going to different clusters mostly.\nConflict might happen later if we both go for (1,1) or (3,0) eventually, but that's future turns.\n\nJustification:\n1.  Safety: LEFT is safe (empty cell).\n2.  Strategy: Moves towards the cluster of apples (0,1), (1,1), (3,0).\n3.  Flexibility: Keeps me at y=1, allowing UP/DOWN moves, unlike DOWN which puts me at y=0 (wall).\n\nPlan: Move left to approach the apple cluster at the bottom left. Maintain flexibility to maneuver around the enemy snake if needed.\n\nDecision: LEFT.\n\nFinal output format:\n[Plan text]\nLEFT\n\nWait, the prompt says \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\" and \"You may also write a short long-term plan...\". It seems the \"rationale\" is what I write. The \"Plan\" is specifically for the \"last move information\" on the *next* turn, but I can write it now for my own sake or to satisfy the \"long-term plan\" instruction.\nThe prompt says: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo I should definitely write a plan note.\nThe \"think out loud\" and \"explain reasoning\" is the main body of my response.\nSo I will write my reasoning, then a plan note, then the move.\n\nReasoning:\n1.  Analyze current state (Head at 8,1, Body [(9,1),(9,0)], Apples nearby).\n2.  Evaluate moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe. RIGHT is death.\n3.  Compare UP/DOWN/LEFT.\n    *   LEFT: Directly moves towards (0,1), (1,1), (1,4), (2,3). Keeps y=1 (flexible).\n    *   DOWN: Moves towards (3,0). Puts me on y=0 (less flexible).\n    *   UP: Moves away from most apples.\n4.  Choose LEFT.\n5.  Write Plan.\n6.  Write Move.\n\nPlan note content:\n\"Navigate towards the apple cluster at (0,1), (1,1), and (3,0). Keep the y-axis flexible (stay at y=1 or nearby). Avoid the enemy snake at (4,7) by maintaining distance.\"\n\nWait, the prompt says \"This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo I should write it in the format expected for a \"Rationale\".\n\"**START RATIONALE** ... **END RATIONALE**\"?\nNo, the prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan... This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nIt implies I just write the text.\nGiven the \"Your last move information\" section in the prompt, it starts with \"**START LAST RATIONALE**\".\nI don't need to add those tags myself. I just need to write the text that would go there.\nSo I'll write a paragraph explaining my plan.\n\nWait, looking at the user prompt again:\n\"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo:\n1. Reasoning (Optional but \"You may think out loud...\").\n2. Plan Note.\n3. Final Move (One word).\n\nI'll just combine reasoning and plan into a clear explanation.\n\nOne detail: \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\nThis matches the board visual where y=0 is the bottom row.\n\nFinal check on the \"Last Move\" provided in the prompt:\n\"START LAST MOVE PICK\nLEFT\nEND LAST MOVE PICK\"\nThis confirms I moved LEFT on Turn 4. My head moved from (9,1) to (8,1).\nThis matches the \"Current State\" in the prompt.\n\nDouble check the board visual for potential hidden traps.\nRow 8: `. . . . T . . . . .`. (Snake 0 body at 4,8).\nRow 7: `. . . . 0 . . . . .`. (Snake 0 head at 4,7).\nRow 1: `A A . . . . . . 1 T`. (My head at 8,1, Body at 9,1).\nRow 0: `. . . A . . . . . T`. (My body/tail at 9,0).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7,1):\nIs (7,1) clear? Yes, visual shows `.`.\nIs there any other snake at (7,1)? No.\nIs it out of bounds? No.\nIs it into my body? My body is (8,1) and (9,1). So no.\nIs it backwards? My neck is (9,1). (7,1) is not (9,1). So no.\n\nLooks good.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves LEFT to (3,7)?\nNot relevant this turn.\nWhat if the enemy moves DOWN to (4,6)?\nNot relevant this turn.\n\nOkay, I am confident in LEFT.\n\nOne tiny thought: The apple at (3,0).\nIf I go LEFT, I can eventually go DOWN to get it.\nIf I go DOWN, I can eventually go LEFT to get it.\nBut (0,1) and (1,1) are on the same row I am currently on (y=1).\nSo starting to go LEFT immediately is the most efficient path for those.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves to cut me off?\nEnemy is at (4,7). I am at (8,1).\nIf enemy moves DOWN repeatedly and I move LEFT repeatedly, we might meet near (1,1)?\nLet's simulate.\nTurn 5: Me (7,1), Enemy (4,6).\nTurn 6: Me (6,1), Enemy (4,5).\nTurn 7: Me (5,1), Enemy (4,4).\nTurn 8: Me (4,1), Enemy (4,3).\nTurn 9: Me (3,1), Enemy (4,2).\nTurn 10: Me (2,1), Enemy (4,1).\nWait, if I am at (2,1) and enemy is at (4,1), we are separated by 2 columns.\nBut if the enemy continues down to (4,1), and I continue left to (2,1), we are fine.\nIf the enemy wants the apple at (1,4), it will go DOWN.\nIf the enemy wants the apple at (3,0), it will go DOWN and LEFT.\nIf the enemy wants the apple at (1,1), it has to go LEFT and DOWN.\nThe enemy is at (4,7). (1,1) is distance 3+6=9.\nI am at (8,1). (1,1) is distance 7.\nI am much closer to (1,1).\nIf the enemy rushes (1,1), it will lose.\nThe enemy should probably go for (1,4) or (2,3) or (3,0).\n(3,0) is distance 1+7=8 for enemy. Distance 5 for me (if I go DOWN) or 6 (if I go LEFT then DOWN).\nSo I am closer to (3,0) than the enemy.\nSo I have priority on the bottom apples.\nTherefore, moving towards them (LEFT) is safe.\n\nPlan:\n\"Plan: Continue moving left to approach the apples at (1,1) and (0,1). This path keeps me flexible to move down towards (3,0) or up towards the center later. I will monitor the enemy snake's movement to avoid potential interception.\"\n\nMove: LEFT\n\nResponse structure:\n[Explanation of reasoning]\n[Plan]\nLEFT\n\nI will keep the reasoning concise.\n\nFinal check on the \"Rules\":\n\"Snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail\". Yes.\n\"Turn: 5 / 150\". Yes.\n\"Apples at...\". Yes.\n\"Scores...\". Yes.\n\"Your snake (ID: 1) ... Head: (8, 1), Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)]\". This confirms the state.\nVisual board confirms the state.\n\nOne last check. \"Moving directly backwards into your own body ... counts as hitting yourself\".\nMy body is at (9,1) and (9,0).\nMy head is at (8,1).\nMy previous head was (9,1).\nSo the \"neck\" is (9,1).\nMoving to (9,1) is backwards.\nMoving to (7,1) is left. Safe.\nMoving to (8,0) is down. Safe.\nMoving to (8,2) is up. Safe.\n\nOkay, I'm ready.\n\nReasoning summary:\nCurrent position (8,1) is safe. Options are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\nLEFT moves towards the cluster of 3 apples at the bottom left (0,1, 1,1, 3,0).\nDOWN moves towards (3,0) but puts me against the wall (y=0).\nUP moves away from apples.\nLEFT is the best balance of safety and objective progress.\n\nPlan:\n\"Move left to get closer to the apples at (1,1) and (0,1). Keep the path open to move down for (3,0) or stay on row 1 to collect the row 1 apples. Maintain awareness of the enemy snake at (4,7).\"\n\nMove: LEFT\n\nWait, the prompt says \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\".\nIt also says \"You may also write a short long-term plan... This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo I should probably write the \"Rationale\" style text, then the plan, then the move.\nOr just write a coherent text covering both.\nI'll write a short analysis, then the plan (to be used for next turn), then the move.\n\nText:\n\"Analysis: Current head is (8,1). Safe moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. Moving LEFT aligns me with the apple cluster at (0,1) and (1,1) and keeps me flexible. Moving DOWN puts me on the bottom wall. Moving UP moves away from immediate goals. LEFT is the optimal direction.\n\nPlan: Navigate left towards (1,1) and (0,1). Monitor the enemy at (4,7) and be ready to pivot down towards (3,0) or up if the enemy approaches.\"\n\nWait, the \"Plan\" part needs to be what will be shown as \"Last Rationale\" next turn.\nThe user's example of \"Last Rationale\" started with \"1. Situation Analysis:\".\nSo maybe I should just write a numbered list?\nThe user said \"You may also write a short long-term plan... Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nIt doesn't specify the format strictly, but looking at the example, it's a block of text.\nI'll write a clear, concise text.\n\nLet's refine the Plan text to be useful for \"Next Turn Me\".\n\"Current position: (8,1). Moving LEFT to (7,1). This brings us closer to the apples at (1,1) and (0,1). Next turn, we will likely continue LEFT or consider DOWN to grab (3,0). Watch out for the enemy snake (4,7) moving down.\"\n\nActually, the prompt says \"This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo it should probably look like the \"Rationale\" provided in the prompt (which starts with \"1. Situation Analysis...\").\nI'll stick to a simple paragraph describing the intention.\n\nDecision:\nI will write my reasoning/explanation, followed by the plan, then the move.\nThe plan text will be: \"Move left to approach the apples at (1,1) and (0,1). Maintain flexibility to move down towards (3,0) or up if the enemy closes in. Avoid getting trapped against walls.\"\n\nWait, I should not add anything after the move word.\nSo:\n[Reasoning and Plan text]\nMOVE\n\nMake sure the move is the ONLY thing on the last line.\n\nOne small thing: The prompt says \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\nThis matches the board where Row 0 is the bottom.\nIn my reasoning, I referred to y=0 as \"bottom\" and y=1 as \"2nd from bottom\". This is correct.\n\nFinal check on apples.\nApples at: (0, 1), (3, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 3).\nI am at (8,1).\n(0,1) is at x=0, y=1.\n(1,1) is at x=1, y=1.\n(3,0) is at x=3, y=0.\n(1,4) is at x=1, y=4.\n(2,3) is at x=2, y=3.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7,1):\nDistance to (1,1) is 6.\nDistance to (0,1) is 7.\nDistance to (3,0) is 4 (LEFT to 3,1) + 1 (DOWN) = 5.\nDistance to (1,4) is 6 (LEFT) + 3 (UP) = 9.\nDistance to (2,3) is 5 (LEFT) + 2 (UP) = 7.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,0):\nDistance to (3,0) is 5 (LEFT).\nDistance to (1,1) is 7 (LEFT) + 1 (UP) = 8.\nDistance to (0,1) is 8 (LEFT) + 1 (UP) = 9.\nDistance to (1,4) is 7 (LEFT) + 4 (UP) = 11.\nDistance to (2,3) is 6 (LEFT) + 3 (UP) = 9.\n\nThe average distance to apples is lower if I go LEFT.\nAlso, the \"shortest distance\" to an apple is 5 for DOWN (to 3,0) and 6 for LEFT (to 1,1).\nBut there are *two* apples at (0,1) and (1,1).\nSo the LEFT path offers a cluster.\n\nThe decision is solid. LEFT.\n\nI will write the response now.\n\nStructure:\n1. Brief analysis of the situation.\n2. Evaluation of immediate moves.\n3. Strategic choice (LEFT).\n4. Long-term plan (for the user/future self).\n5. The move (LEFT).\n\nThe prompt says \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\" so I don't strictly *have* to use the \"1. Situation Analysis\" numbering, but it helps clarity. I'll use a simple paragraph style to be concise.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.\"\nSo I must ensure no trailing text on the line with the move.\n\nI'll write the text, then a new line with just \"LEFT\".\n\nOne minor detail: The prompt says \"My last move information... LEFT\". So I successfully moved LEFT last turn.\nThis means I am currently at (8,1).\nVisual confirmation: Row 1 has `1` at x=8.\nVisual confirmation: Row 1 has `T` at x=9.\nVisual confirmation: Row 0 has `T` at x=9.\nSo the snake is:\nHead (8,1)\nSegment 1 (9,1)\nSegment 2 (9,0) -> Tail.\nLength 3.\nSince I grew last turn (ate an apple), this is correct.\n\nWait, if I ate last turn, and I am at (8,1), did I eat at (8,1)?\nThe previous state had head at (9,1).\nI moved LEFT to (8,1).\nWas there an apple at (8,1)?\nThe previous state apples were: (0, 1), (3, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 3).\nNo apple at (8,1).\nSo I didn't eat on turn 4.\nWait, the \"Last Rationale\" says \"I grew last turn\".\nIf I didn't eat, I didn't grow.\nBut the \"Last Rationale\" also says \"I grew last turn, so my tail (8, 1) will clear this turn.\"\nThis implies I *did* eat, and the tail was at (8,1).\nIf I ate, I grew.\nIf I ate on turn 4, my tail did not move on turn 4.\nSo on turn 5, the tail moves.\nWait, if the tail moves on turn 5, and I am at (8,1), and my body is [(9,1), (9,0)].\nIf the tail is (9,0), it moves to (9,1).\nIf the tail is (9,1), it moves to (8,1).\nBut the prompt says \"Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)]\".\nThis implies the connection is: Head(8,1) -> (9,1) -> (9,0).\nSo (9,0) is the tail.\nIf I grew, the tail stays at (9,0). So my length is 3.\nIf I didn't grow, the tail moves from (9,0).\nIf I didn't grow, the tail would move to (9,1).\nBut (9,1) is occupied by my body.\nWait, if I move LEFT to (7,1):\nNew Head: (7,1).\nNew Body: (8,1).\nNew Tail: (9,1)? No, if the tail moved.\nLet's look at the \"Rules\":\n\"Each turn, you choose one move... Every snake's head moves... at the same time.\"\n\"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment...\"\n\"If you do not move onto an apple, your body follows your head... and your tail moves forward one cell.\"\n\nSo:\nTurn 4:\n- I moved LEFT to (8,1).\n- Did I eat? \"Apples collected: 2\".\n- Current state: Head (8,1), Body [(9,1), (9,0)].\n- Previous Rationale: \"I grew last turn\".\n- If I grew on Turn 4, I ate an apple on Turn 4.\n- The apple eaten must have been at (8,1)? No, apples are at (0,1), (3,0), (1,1), (1,4), (2,3).\n- Wait, the \"Apples\" listed in the prompt are the *current* apples.\n- If I ate on Turn 4, that apple is gone.\n- So, the apples listed are the ones currently on the board.\n- I have 2 apples collected.\n- My length is 3 (Head + 2 body).\n- If I ate 2 apples, length should be 3. Correct.\n- So I ate 2 apples in the past.\n- Did I eat on Turn 4? The Rationale says \"I grew last turn\".\n- If I grew on Turn 4, then on Turn 5, my tail will clear (move).\n- Current Tail is (9,0).\n- If I move and don't eat, tail moves to (9,1).\n- If I move and DO eat, tail stays (9,0) and I add a segment.\n\nLet's assume I did NOT eat on Turn 4, despite the rationale saying \"I grew last turn\".\nWait, the rationale is provided by the *system/user*.\n\"START LAST RATIONALE ... I grew last turn, so my tail (8, 1) will clear this turn.\"\nThis is confusing because the \"Current State\" says Body is [(9,1), (9,0)].\nIf my tail was (8,1), and I grew, then (8,1) is still part of the body? No.\nIf I am at (9,1) and I grow, my tail stays at (8,1).\nThen I move LEFT to (8,1).\nI eat an apple (maybe).\nIf I ate, I grow again.\nThen my tail stays at (8,1).\nBut I am now at (8,1).\nThis is contradictory.\n\nLet's assume the \"Current State\" (Head: (8,1), Body: [(9,1), (9,0)]) is absolute truth.\nThis means:\nHead (8,1)\nSegment 1 (9,1)\nTail (9,0)\nLength 3.\nI have 2 apples.\nSo I ate 2 apples.\nMy current length is 3.\nIf I eat another apple, length becomes 4.\nIf I don't eat, length stays 3.\n\nWait, if my length is 3, and I am at (8,1), (9,1), (9,0).\nThis looks like a snake that is stuck or turning.\nIf I move LEFT to (7,1):\nI go to (7,1).\nMy body becomes (8,1).\nThe tail is (9,0).\nThe tail (9,0) moves to (9,1) if I didn't eat.\nBut (9,1) is occupied by my body (the segment after the head).\nSo, if I didn't eat, the tail moves from (9,0) to (9,1).\nWait, the body is (9,1) and (9,0).\nIf the tail is (9,0), and it moves, it goes to (9,1).\nBut (9,1) is currently occupied by the body.\nIf I move to (7,1), the body shifts.\nNew head (7,1).\nNew body: (8,1).\nOld body (9,1) becomes... the new tail?\nLet's trace carefully.\nStart Turn 5:\nHead: (8,1)\nBody: [(9,1), (9,0)] (Wait, is (9,0) the tail or part of the body?)\nUsually \"Body\" list includes everything *except* the head?\n\"Head: (8, 1), Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)]\".\nIf Body includes the tail, then the tail is (9,0).\nIf Body excludes the tail, then the tail is something else.\nStandard snake rules: List is Head, Segments..., Tail.\nIf the list is \"Body: [(9, 1), (9, 0)]\", and Head is separate, then the snake is:\nHead (8,1) -> (9,1) -> (9,0).\nSo (9,0) is the tail.\nLength = 3.\nI have 2 apples. Length 3. Consistent.\n\nNow, I move LEFT to (7,1).\nDid I eat an apple?\nThere are no apples at (7,1).\nSo I did not eat.\nSo, my length remains 3.\nSo, the tail moves.\nThe tail is (9,0).\nIt moves to the previous position of the segment in front of it.\nThe segment in front of (9,0) is (9,1).\nSo the tail moves to (9,1).\nBut (9,1) is currently occupied by the body segment (9,1).\nHowever, the body shifts.\nNew Head: (7,1).\nNew Body: [ (8,1) ].\nThe old body segment (9,1) becomes the new tail?\nLet's look at the standard snake logic.\nSnake: H, S1, S2, ..., T.\nMove H to NewPos.\nIf ate: Snake becomes NewH, H, S1, ..., T. (Length +1).\nIf not ate: Snake becomes NewH, H, S1, ..., S_{n-1}. T disappears. (Length same).\nHere:\nSnake: H(8,1), S1(9,1), T(9,0).\nMove H to (7,1).\nDid I eat? No.\nNew Snake:\nNew H(7,1), S1(8,1), T(9,1)? No, S1 becomes (8,1).\nThe old S1 (9,1) becomes the new T?\nWait, if length stays 3, we have H, S1, T.\nOld: H=8,1, S1=9,1, T=9,0.\nNew: H=7,1, S1=8,1.\nWhere is T?\nThe old T (9,0) is discarded.\nThe old S1 (9,1) becomes the new T? No, that means the body length stays 2.\nOld S1 is (9,1).\nNew S1 is (8,1).\nSo we need a new T.\nThe old T was (9,0).\nIf we discard (9,0), the new T is the old S1 (9,1).\nSo new state: H(7,1), Body[(8,1), (9,1)].\nThis makes sense.\nThe tail moves from (9,0) to (9,1).\nSo (9,0) becomes empty.\n(9,1) is still occupied (as the tail).\nSo, if I move LEFT to (7,1):\nMy new body is [(8,1), (9,1)].\n(9,0) becomes empty.\n\nSo, if I move DOWN to (8,0):\nNew H(8,0), Body[(8,1), (9,1)].\n(9,0) becomes empty.\n\nSo, (9,0) is safe to ignore/move away from.\nIt will become empty.\nThe cell (9,1) will become the tail (if I don't eat).\nSo (9,1) is currently occupied and will remain occupied.\nSo I cannot move to (9,1).\nWhich I already knew.\n\nOkay, the logic holds.\nMoving LEFT is safe.\n\nOne final check on the \"Scores\".\nSnake 1: 2 apples.\nSnake 0: 1 apple.\nI am winning.\nIf I survive, I likely win.\nIf the enemy eats 4 apples, they win.\nI need to keep eating to extend my lead or at least stay safe.\nThe apples I am moving towards are safe.\n\nPlan text:\n\"Plan: Move left towards the apple cluster at (1,1) and (0,1). This keeps us on row 1, which offers flexibility to move up or down. We will monitor the enemy at (4,7) and adjust if they approach our path.\"\n\nMove: LEFT\n\nThe user wants \"Your last move information\" to be included in the prompt, so I should probably just output the new move and reasoning. The prompt is very specific about the format of the *input* it gives me. I just need to provide the *output*.\nThe output should be:\n[Reasoning]\n[Plan]\nMOVE\n\nI will write a clear reasoning.\n\"Current position is (8,1). I can move UP, DOWN, or LEFT. Moving LEFT is the best option because it moves me towards the apples at (1,1) and (0,1) while keeping me in a flexible position (not against the wall at y=0). Moving UP is safe but moves away from the closest apples. Moving DOWN puts me against the bottom wall, limiting future moves.\"\n\nPlan:\n\"Continue moving left to approach the bottom-left apples. Watch the enemy snake to avoid head-on collisions.\"\n\nMove:\nLEFT\n\nThis seems complete and correct.Analyzing the board, my snake is currently at (8,1) with a length of 3. The available apples are clustered in the bottom-left section of the board, specifically at (0,1), (1,1), and (3,0). The enemy snake is at (4,7), which is far enough away to not be an immediate collision threat, but likely moving toward the center apples.\n\nEvaluating possible moves from (8,1):\n- **UP** to (8,2): Safe, but moves away from the nearest apples at (1,1) and (0,1).\n- **DOWN** to (8,0): Safe, and moves towards the apple at (3,0). However, this places me against the bottom wall (y=0), which limits my escape routes if the enemy approaches or if I get trapped.\n- **LEFT** to (7,1): Safe, and directly moves me towards the apples at (1,1) and (0,1). It keeps me at y=1, maintaining flexibility to move up or down in future turns.\n- **RIGHT** to (9,1): Unsafe (occupied by my own body).\n\n**Strategy:**\nMoving **LEFT** is the optimal choice. It efficiently closes the distance to the cluster of three apples at the bottom left. By staying at y=1, I avoid the bottom wall trap and keep my movement options open.\n\nPlan: Move left towards the apples at (1,1) and (0,1). Maintain flexibility to pivot down for (3,0) or up if the enemy snake approaches. Avoid getting trapped against walls.\n\nLEFT",

I cannot move LEFT because that would be into my own body (7,1), causing me to die.\nI am currently on Y=1.\n- **UP (6,2)** is empty. This keeps me safe and maintains horizontal space (X=5,6,7 available). However, it moves me away from the apples at (1,1) and (0,1), though (2,3) is accessible.\n- **DOWN (6,0)** is empty. Moving here allows me to reach the apple at (3,0) next turn. While Y=0 is a wall, I have plenty of space to the left on that row to maneuver for the apple, and I can return to Y=1 later. Being at Y=0 creates a predictable path that the enemy (Snake #0 at (4,5)) is unlikely to block immediately.\n- **RIGHT (7,1)** is currently occupied by my own body (7,1). However, my body moves simultaneously. My tail is currently at (8,1), and the body segment at (7,1) will move to (8,1). If I move to (7,1), the snake body will successfully shift, and this move is valid. This moves me towards the apple at (3,0) but requires a turn at (6,0) or (5,0) to actually get there.\n\nComparing **DOWN** vs **RIGHT**:\n**DOWN** moves me to (6,0), putting me directly on the row with the apple (3,0). From (6,0), I can move LEFT to (5,0), then (4,0), then (3,0). This path is direct and utilizes the bottom wall for protection on the left side.\n**RIGHT** moves me to (7,1). From there, I would likely need to go DOWN to (7,0) or UP to (7,2) to maneuver around. This adds a turn of delay compared to going DOWN immediately.\n\nSince avoiding my own body is mandatory, and I have two distinct safe options:\n1. **LEFT (7,1)**: Safe (body moves out of the way). Horizontal movement toward apples.\n2. **DOWN (6,0)**: Safe. Moves toward the apple at (3,0) and utilizes the wall for safety.\n3. **UP (6,2)**: Safe. Moves away from apples.\n\nMoving **DOWN** to (6,0) is the most efficient move to collect the apple at (3,0). While moving LEFT (to 7,1) maintains the current Y level, DOWN puts me immediately on the resource row. I will choose DOWN.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "The snake's head is at (6, 0). The tail is currently at (8, 1).\nI need to determine the valid moves that do not result in a collision.\n\n1.  **UP**: Target cell (6, 1).\n    *   Current state: The body segment at (6, 1) is directly behind the head.\n    *   On the next turn, the tail moves from (8, 1) to (7, 1), and the segment at (7, 1) moves to (6, 1). The head moves to (6, 1).\n    *   Result: The head successfully occupies (6, 1) as the body shifts. This is a **valid move**.\n\n2.  **DOWN**: Target cell (6, -1).\n    *   This is outside the board (y < 0).\n    *   Result: **Invalid move (Death)**.\n\n3.  **LEFT**: Target cell (5, 0).\n    *   Board shows: Row 0, Col 5 is empty (`.`).\n    *   Body is at (6, 1) and (7, 1). (5, 0) is not occupied.\n    *   Result: **Valid move**.\n\n4.  **RIGHT**: Target cell (7, 0).\n    *   Board shows: Row 0, Col 7 is empty (`.`).\n    *   Body is at (6, 1) and (7, 1). (7, 0) is not occupied.\n    *   Result: **Valid move**.\n\n**Analysis of Valid Moves:**\n\n*   **UP**: Moves to (6, 1). This keeps the snake near the center-left. It avoids the wall at Y=0. From (6, 1), I can access (5, 1), (7, 1), or (6, 2). (5, 1) and (7, 1) are currently blocked by my own body segments that will move, but (6, 2) is open. This seems safe and maintains vertical mobility.\n*   **LEFT**: Moves to (5, 0). This puts me on the bottom row (Y=0), which is a wall. From (5, 0), I can only move UP or RIGHT (LEFT would be to (4, 0), which is open). While this moves towards the apple at (3, 0), getting stuck on the bottom row limits maneuvering space if the enemy approaches or if I need to dodge. The apple at (3, 0) is still 2 moves away.\n*   **RIGHT**: Moves to (7, 0). This puts me on the bottom row. From (7, 0), I can move LEFT or UP. This moves me away from the apple at (3, 0) and towards the empty corner (8,0) or (9,0). This seems like a poor strategic choice as it moves away from resources.\n\n**Comparison:**\nBetween `UP` and `LEFT`, `UP` seems strictly safer because it avoids the bottom wall restriction. While `LEFT` approaches the apple at (3, 0), the path from (6, 0) to (3, 0) on the bottom row is `(5,0) -> (4,0) -> (3,0)`. However, the enemy snake is at (4, 4). If the enemy moves DOWN to (4, 3), then DOWN to (4, 2), then DOWN to (4, 1), they could intercept. But `UP` keeps my options open.\n\nWait, let's re-evaluate `UP`. The cell (6, 1) is currently occupied by my body. However, in Snake games, moving into the cell immediately behind the head is valid because that segment moves forward into the tail's old position.\nLet's verify coordinates:\nHead: (6, 0)\nBody: (6, 1), (7, 1)\nTail: (8, 1)\n\nIf I move UP to (6, 1):\nHead moves to (6, 1).\nBody becomes (6, 1), (6, 0). (Wait, the old head becomes the new neck).\nThe body list updates: New Head (6, 1) + Old Head (6, 0) + Old Body (7, 1).\nWait, the body list is Head -> Neck -> Tail.\nCurrent: (6, 0) -> (6, 1) -> (7, 1).\nMoving UP to (6, 1):\nNew Head: (6, 1).\nNew Body: (6, 0) (previous head), (6, 1) (previous neck).\nWait, that overlaps?\nLet's trace the movement properly.\nSnake occupies: {(6,0), (6,1), (7,1)}.\nTarget (6, 1) is occupied.\nHowever, the segment at (6, 1) moves to (6, 0).\nThe segment at (7, 1) moves to (6, 1).\nSo:\nStep 1: Tail (7, 1) moves to (6, 1). Snake occupies {(6,0), (6,1)}.\nStep 2: Head moves to (6, 1).\nCollision check: Head lands on (6, 1) exactly where the tail just moved. This is valid.\nSo `UP` is a safe move.\n\nLet's compare `UP` and `LEFT` again.\n`UP`: (6, 1). From here I can go to (5, 1) or (6, 2) or (7, 1) next turn.\n`LEFT`: (5, 0). From here I can go to (4, 0) or (6, 0) next turn.\n\nApples at: (0, 1), (3, 0), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 3).\nFrom (6, 1):\n- To (3, 0): (5, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 0) is 4 moves. Or (5, 1) -> (5, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (3, 0) is 4 moves.\n- To (2, 3): (5, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (2, 3) is 4 moves.\n- To (1, 1): (5, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (1, 1) is 5 moves.\n\nFrom (5, 0):\n- To (3, 0): (4, 0) -> (3, 0) is 2 moves.\n- To (1, 1): (4, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (1, 1) is 5 moves.\n\nThe apple at (3, 0) is very close if I go `LEFT`. However, I am moving onto the bottom wall.\nThe apple at (1, 1) is also accessible. (1, 1) is occupied by 'A'.\nFrom (6, 1), going for (1, 1) is risky because the enemy is at (4, 4). The enemy can easily move down to intercept (3, 2) or (2, 2).\nFrom (6, 1), I have open space.\nFrom (5, 0), I am squeezed against the wall.\n\nThe enemy snake #0 is at (4, 4). It has 1 apple.\nI have 2 apples.\nMy position (6, 0) is low.\nGoing UP to (6, 1) gives me more flexibility. I can reach the apple at (2, 3) or (1, 4).\nThe apple at (3, 0) is a high-value target because it's only 3 cells away (Left, Left, Left).\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 0), then I can eat (3, 0) in two moves (Left, Left).\nBut what happens after?\nIf I eat (3, 0), I grow. My tail won't move for that turn. The turn after, I need to leave the bottom row.\nAt (3, 0), I can only go UP (3, 1) or LEFT (2, 0).\n(3, 1) might be occupied or approachable by the enemy.\n(2, 0) is safe.\n\nLet's look at `UP`.\nIf I go `UP` to (6, 1), I am in the open. I can then go `LEFT` to (5, 1).\nFrom (5, 1), I can go `LEFT` to (4, 1) and then `DOWN` to (4, 0) to get to the bottom row apple (3, 0).\nOr I can go `UP` from (5, 1) to (5, 2) to chase (2, 3).\n\nActually, looking at the board:\nRow 1: `A A . . . . T T . .`\nMy body is at (6, 1) and (7, 1).\nIf I go UP to (6, 1), my tail (currently 7,1) moves to 6,1. Wait, my body is [(6, 1), (7, 1)].\nHead (6, 0).\nTarget (6, 1). This is occupied by my body.\nBUT, the snake moves simultaneously. The segment at (6, 1) moves to (6, 0).\nThe segment at (7, 1) moves to (6, 1).\nSo the target cell (6, 1) is vacated by the segment moving to (6, 0).\nSo `UP` is valid.\n\nLet's re-read the board carefully.\nRow 1: `. A A . . . . T T . .` (Wait, coordinates start at 0)\nRow 1:\nCol 0: .\nCol 1: A\nCol 2: A\n...\nCol 6: T (Wait, the body description says Head (6,0), Body [(6,1), (7,1)].\nSo (6,1) and (7,1) are the body.\nThe board diagram shows 'T' at (6,1) and (7,1) (and 8,1? No, body length is 2).\nLet's trust the coordinate list: (6,1) and (7,1).\n\nIf I go UP:\nNew Head: (6, 1).\nNew Body: [(6, 0), (7, 1)].\nWait, if I move UP, the old head (6,0) becomes the new neck.\nThe old neck (6,1) becomes part of the body, but wait, the head is moving to (6,1).\nSo (6,1) is the destination.\nThe body segment currently at (6,1) moves to (6,0).\nThe body segment at (7,1) moves to (6,1).\nSo the destination (6,1) is occupied by the moving tail (from 7,1). This is allowed.\nSo `UP` is valid.\n\nLet's compare `UP` and `LEFT` again.\n`LEFT` takes me to (5,0). From there, I can go to (3,0) in 2 steps.\n`UP` takes me to (6,1).\nFrom (6,1), I can go to (5,1).\nFrom (5,1), I can go to (4,1).\nFrom (4,1), I can go to (4,0).\nFrom (4,0), I can go to (3,0).\nThat's 4 steps. Or (5,1) -> (5,0) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) (3 steps from (5,1)).\nSo `LEFT` is faster for (3,0).\nBut `UP` is safer.\n\nIs there a threat?\nEnemy at (4,4).\nIf Enemy goes DOWN to (4,3), DOWN to (4,2), DOWN to (4,1).\nI am at (6,1).\nIf I go UP to (6,1), I'm safer.\nIf I go LEFT to (5,0), I'm stuck on the bottom row. If the enemy decides to rush down the center (x=4), I might have trouble escaping the bottom wall. I am at Y=0.\nFrom (5,0), my only safe exits are (4,0) or (6,0).\nIf I go to (4,0) to get the apple (3,0), I am closer to the enemy.\n(4,0) is 4 cells away from (4,4).\nThe enemy can cover 3 cells per turn (down, down, down).\nI am moving there to eat an apple.\nThis seems risky.\n\nIf I go UP to (6,1), I maintain my position in the open field.\nI can then target the apple at (1,1) or (2,3) or (1,4).\nLet's check (1,1). It's at (1,1).\nFrom (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1). 5 moves.\nFrom (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,2) -> (2,3). 4 moves.\nFrom (6,1) -> (6,2) -> (5,2) -> (4,2) -> (3,2) -> (2,3). 5 moves.\nFrom (6,1) -> (6,2) -> (6,3) -> (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (2,3). 6 moves.\n\nWhat if I go `RIGHT` to (7,0)?\nFrom (7,0), I can go UP to (7,1).\n(7,1) is currently my body. If I go UP to (7,1), the body moves.\nCurrent: Head (6,0), Body (6,1), (7,1).\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,0):\nNew Head (7,0). Body (6,0), (6,1).\nIf I then go UP to (7,1):\nTarget (7,1). Current body (6,1) moves to (6,0). (7,1) is empty (previous body was 6,1, 7,1). Wait.\nOld body: (6,1), (7,1).\nOld Head: (6,0).\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,0):\nHead becomes (7,0).\nBody becomes (6,0), (6,1).\nTail becomes (6,1).\nIf I then move UP to (7,1):\nTarget (7,1).\nCurrent body: (6,0), (6,1).\n(6,1) moves to (6,0).\n(6,0) moves to (7,1)?\nWait, the tail moves to the position of the second-to-last segment.\nSegment 2 (6,0) moves to Segment 3 position? No.\nThe tail (6,1) moves to (6,0).\nThe segment (6,0) (which is the old head) moves to... wait.\nList: [Head (6,0), (6,1), (7,1)].\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,0):\nNew List: [Head (7,0), (6,0), (6,1)].\nTail is (6,1).\nIf I then move UP to (7,1):\nTarget (7,1).\nCurrent body is [(7,0), (6,0), (6,1)].\nSegment (6,1) moves to (6,0).\nSegment (6,0) moves to (7,0)? No, it moves to the previous position of the segment in front of it?\nIn a standard snake:\n1. Tail moves to the cell of the segment in front of it.\n2. Body segments move to the cell of the segment in front of them.\n3. Head moves to the new cell.\nSo:\nCurrent state (after RIGHT): Head (7,0), Body (6,0), Tail (6,1).\nMoving UP to (7,1):\n1. Tail (6,1) moves to (6,0). (Occupied by body segment).\n2. Body segment (6,0) moves to (7,0). (Occupied by head).\n3. Head moves to (7,1).\nSo (7,1) is empty.\nWait, after RIGHT: positions are (7,0), (6,0), (6,1).\nIf I move UP:\nTarget (7,1).\n(6,1) -> (6,0).\n(6,0) -> (7,0).\nHead -> (7,1).\nSo (7,1) is empty. Valid.\n\nHowever, moving RIGHT puts me in the corner (7,0). I don't want to be in the corner.\nSo `RIGHT` is bad.\n\nWhat about `LEFT`?\nMove LEFT to (5,0).\nState: Head (5,0), Body (6,0), Tail (6,1).\nI am on the bottom row.\nFrom (5,0), I can go LEFT to (4,0) to get the apple (3,0).\nIf I go to (4,0), state: Head (4,0), Body (5,0), Tail (6,0).\nThen (3,0) is the apple.\nI eat it. I grow. I stay at (3,0) for one turn (wait, no, I just eat it).\nSo I move to (3,0). My tail doesn't move that turn.\nNext turn, I need to move.\nI can go UP (3,1) or LEFT (2,0).\n(3,1) is empty.\n(2,0) is empty.\nIf I go UP (3,1), I am in the open.\nThe enemy is at (4,4).\nDistance from (4,4) to (3,1) is 3 steps (X diff 1, Y diff 3).\nIf the enemy rushes me, I have 2 apples. I need to survive.\nIf I stay on the bottom row (2,0), I have the wall on the right (X=0 is wall).\nI can go (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) (apple) or (2,0) -> (2,1).\n(1,1) is an apple.\nSo the path (5,0) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) gets me 2 apples.\nBut I have to survive the enemy.\n\nLet's consider the enemy's perspective.\nEnemy at (4,4).\nIf I go to (3,0), I am far.\nIf I go UP to (6,1), I am in the middle.\nThe enemy might try to cut me off.\nBut the enemy is slow.\nI am currently at (6,0).\nIf I go UP to (6,1), I have plenty of space.\nIf I go LEFT to (5,0), I trap myself against the wall.\nI should prefer `UP` to keep my options open and avoid the wall.\n\nWait, is there a reason to go LEFT?\nThe apple at (3,0) is worth 1 point.\nGoing UP doesn't give me points immediately.\nBut going LEFT puts me in a position where I might get trapped.\nIf I go UP to (6,1), I am safe.\nFrom (6,1), I can go to (5,1).\nFrom (5,1), I can go to (4,1).\nFrom (4,1), I can go to (4,0).\nFrom (4,0), I can go to (3,0).\nThis path is available.\nSo I can get the apple later, safely.\nI don't need to rush it at the cost of my safety.\n\nAlso, the board shows an apple at (1, 1).\nMy current head is at (6, 0).\nIf I go UP, I can plan to go LEFT and DOWN to (1,1).\nLet's check the \"Last Move Rationale\".\nThe AI previously chose DOWN to go to (6,0) to reach (3,0).\nNow it is at (6,0).\nThe logic was: \"DOWN allows me to reach the apple at (3,0) next turn.\"\nWait, if I am at (6,0), to reach (3,0) next turn, I would need to move LEFT 3 times. That's 3 turns.\n\"From (6,0), I can move LEFT to (5,0), then (4,0), then (3,0).\"\nSo it takes 3 turns.\n\"Moving DOWN to (6,0) is the most efficient move to collect the apple at (3,0).\"\nOkay, so the goal is (3,0).\nBut am I trapped?\nIf I go LEFT to (5,0), I am on the wall.\nIf I go UP to (6,1), I am not on the wall.\nThe enemy is at (4,4).\nThe enemy can easily move down to (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0) and block me or kill me if I am at (3,0) or (4,0).\nIf I am at (6,1), the enemy has to travel further (X distance 2, Y distance 3).\nSo `UP` is safer.\n\nAlso, `UP` keeps me away from the enemy.\n`LEFT` moves me towards the enemy (X 5 -> 4).\n`UP` moves me away (Y 0 -> 1).\nSo `UP` is better.\n\nLet's confirm `UP` is safe.\nHead at (6,0). Target (6,1).\nBody is (6,1), (7,1).\n(6,1) is occupied.\nHowever, the snake moves simultaneously.\nThe segment at (6,1) moves to (6,0).\nThe segment at (7,1) moves to (6,1).\nSo the cell (6,1) is taken by the moving tail (from 7,1).\nIs this allowed?\nIn standard Snake rules, the tail moves *before* the head checks for collision.\nOr the tail moves at the same time.\nUsually, moving into the cell where the tail *was* is safe, but moving into the cell where the body is (if the tail isn't there) is death.\nHere, (6,1) is the *second* segment. The tail is at (7,1).\nWait, the body is `[(6, 1), (7, 1)]`.\nSo (6,1) is the first body segment (neck).\n(7,1) is the tail.\nIf I move UP, the tail moves to (6,1).\nThe head moves to (6,1).\nThis is a collision? Head hits tail?\nIn most versions of Snake, if the tail moves out of the way, it's safe.\nIf the head moves into the cell where the tail *was*, it's safe.\nHere, the head moves into (6,1).\nThe tail (7,1) moves to (6,1).\nSo they both arrive at (6,1).\nIs that allowed?\nUsually, yes. The body length effectively stays the same (the head takes the tail's spot).\nWait, if I eat an apple, the tail doesn't move. Then head moves into (6,1) and body extends. If body extends into (6,1), head collides with body. Death.\nBut I don't have an apple to eat at (6,1).\nSo I am just moving.\nHead moves to (6,1). Tail moves to (6,1).\nIf they land on the same cell, do I die?\nThe rules say: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\nThe tail is part of the body.\nIf the tail moves to (6,1) and the head moves to (6,1), the head is moving into a cell occupied by the body (the tail).\nHowever, usually, the tail is allowed to move out of the way *simultaneously*.\nIf the tail moves to the spot the head is leaving, and the head moves to the spot the tail was... wait, that's the standard move.\nBut here, the head is moving to (6,1).\nThe tail is moving to (6,1).\nThis means the head and tail are meeting.\nWait, if the head moves to (6,1) and the tail moves to (6,1), the tail is effectively gone (consumed) or it's a collision?\nLet's look at the previous turn's logic.\n\"I cannot move LEFT because that would be into my own body (7,1), causing me to die.\"\n\"RIGHT (7,1) is currently occupied... my body moves simultaneously... my tail is currently at (8,1) and the body segment at (7,1) will move to (8,1). If I move to (7,1), the snake body will successfully shift, and this move is valid.\"\nThis confirms that moving into a body segment *that will move away* is valid.\nIn my current case with `UP`:\nTarget (6,1).\nCurrent body segment at (6,1) moves to (6,0).\nSo the cell (6,1) is vacated by the segment moving to (6,0).\nSo `UP` is valid.\nWait, let's re-read carefully.\n\"I am at (6,1) with my body extending to the left at (7,1) and (8,1).\"\nWait, the last move rationale was written when the head was at (6,1)?\nNo, the \"Your snake\" section says:\nHead: (6, 0)\nBody: [(6, 1), (7, 1)]\nSo the body connects (6,0) -> (6,1) -> (7,1).\nThe tail is (7,1).\n\nIf I move UP to (6, 1):\n1. The tail (7, 1) moves to (6, 1).\n2. The segment (6, 1) moves to (6, 0).\n3. Head moves to (6, 1).\n\nThis is a conflict.\nHead wants (6, 1).\nTail wants (6, 1).\nIf both try to occupy the same cell, what happens?\nUsually, the tail moves *into* the cell the body segment just left, and the head moves *into* the cell the tail just left.\nBut here, the head is moving into the *second* segment's cell (6,1), while the tail moves into (7,1) -> (6,1).\nSo the tail is moving into (6,1) because (6,1) is the position of the second segment (which moves to 6,0).\nSo yes, the tail moves to (6,1).\nThe head moves to (6,1).\nThis implies the tail vanishes? No, the snake is shorter?\nNo, if I move UP, the head is at (6,1).\nThe old head (6,0) becomes the new second segment.\nThe old second segment (6,1) becomes... wait.\nIf the head moves to (6,1), and the second segment moves to (6,0), and the tail (7,1) moves to (6,1).\nThen the new snake is:\nHead (6,1), Body [(6,0), (6,1)]? No, that puts (6,1) as head and body. Overlap.\nLet's trace the positions carefully.\nCurrent positions: { (6,0), (6,1), (7,1) }.\nTarget head: (6, 1).\nSimultaneous movement:\n- The segment at (7,1) moves to (6,1).\n- The segment at (6,1) moves to (6,0).\n- The segment at (6,0) moves to... (wait, the head moves to (6,1)).\n\nIf the head moves to (6,1), it lands on the cell (6,1).\nAt the same time, the segment that was at (6,1) moves to (6,0).\nSo the cell (6,1) is vacated by the segment moving to (6,0).\nTherefore, the head can enter (6,1).\nSimultaneously, the tail (7,1) moves to (6,1) ONLY if (6,1) is the location of the segment in front of it.\nThe segment in front of (7,1) is (6,1).\nSo the tail moves to (6,1).\nSo the head and tail both try to enter (6,1).\n\nIs this a collision?\nIf the head enters a cell and the tail enters the same cell, the tail effectively \"disappears\" or the snake is \"cut\"?\nNo, usually in Snake, if the head moves into the cell where the tail was, the tail moves out, and the head occupies it. The snake length stays constant (unless eating).\nBut here, the head is moving into a cell occupied by a body segment (not the tail).\nIf the body segment moves out, it's safe.\nIf the tail moves into that cell simultaneously... usually the tail moves *forward* into the space left by the segment in front.\nThe segment in front of the tail is (6,1).\nSo the tail moves to (6,1).\nThe segment at (6,1) moves to (6,0).\nThe head moves to (6,1).\nSo the head and tail collide.\n\nDoes the head die if it hits the tail?\n\"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\nThe tail is part of the body.\nUsually, the rule is that the tail moves *out* of the way before the head checks collision.\nBut if the head and tail move to the *same* cell, the head hits the tail.\nWait, is the tail considered \"body\" for collision?\nYes.\nSo if Head goes to (6,1) and Tail goes to (6,1), the Head hits the Tail.\nThis kills the Head.\nSo `UP` is a fatal move?\n\nLet's re-read the previous turn's logic again.\n\"I cannot move LEFT because that would be into my own body (7,1), causing me to die.\"\nWhy? Because (7,1) is the tail?\nNo, \"Body: [(6, 1), (7, 1)]\".\nIf head is at (6,1), body is (7,1).\nWait, the previous turn's rationale says: \"I am at (6,1) with my body extending to the left at (7,1) and (8,1).\"\nWait, the prompt says: \"Your last move information: ... DOWN\".\nAnd \"Body: [(6, 1), (7, 1)]\".\nSo the previous state (Last Turn) was:\nHead: (6, 1)\nBody: [(6, 2), (7, 1)]? No.\n\"My last move was DOWN\".\nSo previous Head was (6, 2).\nPrevious Body was [(6, 1), (7, 1)].\nI moved DOWN to (6, 1).\nTarget (6, 1).\nPrevious Body: (6, 1) and (7, 1).\nSo (6, 1) was occupied.\nBUT, the rationale said:\n\"RIGHT (7, 1) is currently occupied by my own body (7, 1). However, my body moves simultaneously. My tail is currently at (8, 1), and the body segment at (7, 1) will move to (8, 1).\"\nWait, that rationale seems to describe a different situation (Head at 6,1, moving Right).\nMy current state is Head (6,0), Body (6,1), (7,1).\nMy last move was DOWN.\nSo previous Head was (6,1).\nPrevious Body was (6,2)? No.\nIf I moved DOWN from (6,1) to (6,0), then the previous state was:\nHead: (6,1)\nBody: [(6,2), (7,1)]?\nWait, the prompt says \"Your snake (ID 1): Head: (6, 0), Body: [(6, 1), (7, 1)]\".\nIf I just moved DOWN, the new head is (6,0).\nOld head (6,1) becomes the new neck (first body segment).\nOld neck (6,2) becomes... wait.\nIf the body was [(6, 1), (7, 1)] *before* the move, and I moved DOWN to (6,0):\nOld Head (6,0)? No, Head was (6,1).\nOld Body (6,1) -> (Wait, (6,1) is the first body segment, so it was the neck).\nSo Previous Head: (6,1)\nPrevious Body: [(6,2), (7,1)]?\nNo, if I am at (6,0) with body [(6,1), (7,1)], that means:\n1. I was at (6,1).\n2. I moved DOWN.\n3. New Head: (6,0).\n4. Old Head (6,1) becomes New Neck.\n5. Old Neck becomes New Body.\nSo Old Neck was (6,1)? No.\nCurrent Body: (6,1), (7,1).\nSo the segment at (6,1) was the neck.\nThe segment at (7,1) was the tail.\nSo previous state:\nHead: (6,1) (Now (6,1))\nNeck: (6,2)? No, (6,1) is the current neck.\nWait. If the current neck is (6,1), then the previous head was at (6,1) and moved to (6,0).\nSo the previous head was (6,1).\nThe previous neck was (6,2)?\nNo, if the current body is (6,1) and (7,1), then (6,1) is adjacent to head (6,0).\n(7,1) is adjacent to (6,1).\nSo the snake is:\n(6,0) -> (6,1) -> (7,1).\nSo the previous head was (6,1).\nThe previous neck was (7,1)?\nIf I moved DOWN from (6,1) to (6,0), the old head (6,1) becomes the new neck.\nSo the new body is (6,1).\nThe old neck becomes the new tail.\nSo the old neck must have been (7,1) for (7,1) to be the tail?\nWait, if the old body was [(7,1), (8,1)]?\nThen moving DOWN from (6,1):\nHead moves to (6,0).\nOld head (6,1) becomes body.\nOld body (7,1) becomes tail.\nSo new body: [(6,1), (7,1)].\nYes! This matches.\nSo the previous state was:\nHead: (6,1)\nBody: [(7,1), (8,1)].\nI moved DOWN to (6,0).\nSo I am safe.\n\nNow back to `UP`.\nCurrent: Head (6,0), Body [(6,1), (7,1)].\nTarget (6,1).\nThe segment at (6,1) moves to (6,0).\nThe segment at (7,1) moves to (6,1).\nHead moves to (6,1).\nThe head and the tail (which moved to 6,1) occupy the same cell.\nDoes the head die?\nUsually in Snake:\n1. The tail moves first (disappears from the old tail position, appears at the new tail position).\n2. The body moves.\n3. The head moves.\nIf the head moves into the cell where the tail *was*, it's safe (the tail has left).\nIf the head moves into the cell where the tail *is going*...\nStandard rules say that if the head enters a cell occupied by *any part of the body* (at the instant of arrival), it dies.\nIf the tail moves to (6,1) and the head moves to (6,1), then at the end of the turn, the head is at (6,1) and the tail is at (6,1).\nIs the tail considered \"body\"?\nYes.\nSo the head hits the body.\nHowever, there is a nuance in some implementations. If the tail moves out of the way, it's fine. But here the tail is moving *into* the head's target.\n\nLet's look at the \"Last Move Rationale\" again.\n\"RIGHT (7, 1) is currently occupied by my own body (7, 1). However, my body moves simultaneously. My tail is currently at (8, 1), and the body segment at (7, 1) will move to (8, 1). If I move to (7, 1), the snake body will successfully shift, and this move is valid.\"\nThis describes moving into a cell occupied by a body segment that is *not the tail*.\nThe segment at (7,1) moves to (8,1).\nThe segment at (6,1) moves to (7,1).\nThe head moves to (7,1).\nWait, the head moves to (7,1).\nThe segment at (6,1) moves to (7,1).\nSo the head and the body segment collide?\nNo, the body segment moves *into* the spot the head is leaving?\nWait, if Head moves RIGHT to (7,1), and Neck (6,1) moves to (7,1), they collide.\nBUT, the Neck moves to (7,1) *because* the head left (7,1)?\nNo, the neck moves to the head's old position? No, the neck moves to the cell the head *occupied*.\nThe head moves to (7,1).\nThe neck moves to (6,1) (the head's old position).\nThe tail moves to (7,1) (the neck's old position).\nWait, if the head moves to (7,1), and the neck was at (6,1), the neck moves to (6,1) (stays put?) No.\nList: [Head, Neck, Tail].\nHead moves to (7,1).\nNeck moves to Head's old pos (6,1).\nTail moves to Neck's old pos (7,1).\nSo if I move RIGHT to (7,1):\nHead -> (7,1).\nNeck -> (6,1).\nTail -> (7,1).\nHead and Tail collide.\nThis would be death in strict collision checks.\n\nHowever, the \"Last Move Rationale\" says this move is valid.\n\"My tail is currently at (8, 1), and the body segment at (7, 1) will move to (8, 1).\"\nWait, the previous state in the rationale was: Head (6,1), Body [(6,2), (7,1)]? No.\n\"I am at (6,1) ... Body extending to the left at (7,1) and (8,1).\"\nSo Head (6,1), Body [(7,1), (8,1)].\nIf Head moves RIGHT to (7,1):\nTarget (7,1) is occupied by body.\nBody segment at (7,1) moves to (8,1).\nBody segment at (8,1) moves to (7,1).\nHead moves to (7,1).\nSo Head and Tail (8,1 -> 7,1) collide?\nWait.\nCurrent: Head (6,1), Body (7,1), Tail (8,1).\nMove RIGHT to (7,1).\n1. Tail (8,1) moves to (7,1) (because the segment in front is 7,1).\n2. Body (7,1) moves to (6,1) (because the segment in front is 6,1).\n3. Head moves to (7,1).\nSo Head (7,1) and Tail (7,1) collide.\n\nThe rationale says: \"My tail is currently at (8, 1), and the body segment at (7, 1) will move to (8, 1).\"\nThis implies:\nNew Tail position = (8, 1).\nSo the segment at (7, 1) moves to (8, 1).\nThe segment at (6, 1) (Neck) moves to (7, 1).\nThe Head moves to (7, 1).\nWait, if Neck moves to (7, 1) and Head moves to (7, 1), they collide.\n\nI think I am overthinking the standard snake rules.\nStandard rules: The tail moves *first*. It leaves its cell. Then the body moves. Then the head moves.\nIf the head moves into a cell occupied by the tail *before* the tail leaves, it dies.\nIf the head moves into a cell occupied by the tail *after* the tail leaves (i.e., the tail moved away), it is safe.\nIf the head moves into the cell the tail is moving *to*... usually the tail is the last thing to update.\n\nLet's assume the game uses the \"standard\" logic where the tail disappears from the end and reappears at the next segment's position.\nIf I move UP to (6,1):\nThe snake is (6,0) -> (6,1) -> (7,1).\nThe segment at (7,1) is the tail.\nThe segment at (6,1) is the second segment.\nIf I move UP:\nThe tail (7,1) moves to (6,1).\nThe second segment (6,1) moves to (6,0).\nThe head moves to (6,1).\nAt the moment the head arrives at (6,1), the tail is also arriving at (6,1).\nIs this a collision?\nIf the game checks \"Is the target cell occupied by ANY body part *excluding the tail*?\", then it's safe.\nIf the game checks \"Is the target cell occupied by ANY body part?\", it's death.\nUsually, moving into the tail's new position is death.\nMoving into the tail's old position is safe.\nMoving into a middle body segment is death (unless that segment moves away).\n\nHere, (6,1) is the middle body segment.\nIt moves to (6,0).\nSo it vacates (6,1).\nSo (6,1) should be empty for the head.\nBUT, the tail moves to (6,1).\nSo is (6,1) empty or occupied?\nOccupied by the tail.\nDoes the head die if it hits the tail?\nUsually, YES.\nIf the head and tail arrive at the same cell, the head dies.\nWhy? Because the tail is \"body\".\nWait, the \"Last Move Rationale\" said: \"I cannot move LEFT because that would be into my own body (7,1), causing me to die.\"\n\"LEFT is safe if body moves out\".\nSo if I move into (7,1), and (7,1) moves to (6,1), it is safe.\nIf I move into (7,1), and (7,1) moves to (8,1), it is safe.\nSo moving into a cell occupied by a body segment is safe IF that segment moves away.\nIn the `UP` move:\nTarget: (6,1).\nOccupant: (6,1) (the second segment).\nDoes (6,1) move away? Yes, to (6,0).\nSo (6,1) is vacated.\nSo the head can move there.\nWait, what about the tail?\nThe tail (7,1) moves to (6,1).\nSo the tail moves *into* (6,1) just as the head does?\nIn a discrete step simulation:\n1. All segments determine their destination.\n2. Segments move to destinations.\nIf two segments have the same destination, is that allowed?\nUsually, segments cannot overlap (except head/tail in some implementations?).\nIf the head and tail overlap, usually the snake dies (head hits body).\nHowever, many Snake implementations explicitly allow the head to move into the space left by the tail, even if the tail is moving into the head's old position. But that's (Head -> Tail) swap.\nHere we have (Head -> Segment1) and (Tail -> Segment1).\nThe tail is moving into Segment1's old spot.\nThe head is moving into Segment1's old spot.\nSegment1 is moving out.\nSo Head and Tail both go to (6,1).\nThis is a collision of Head and Tail.\nI think this is death.\n\nLet's reconsider `UP`.\nIs there any other way to interpret the body?\nCurrent: (6,0), (6,1), (7,1).\nIf I move UP, the snake slides up.\nThe body unrolls.\nIf I move UP, do I occupy (6,1)?\nYes.\nIs (6,1) occupied?\nYes, by the neck.\nBut the neck moves to (6,0).\nSo (6,1) becomes empty.\nSo the head can enter (6,1).\nDoes the tail enter (6,1)?\nThe tail is at (7,1). The segment in front is (6,1).\nSo the tail moves to (6,1).\nSo the tail enters (6,1).\nSo (6,1) is occupied by the tail when the head arrives.\nHead hits tail. Death.\n\nLet's verify this with the `RIGHT` move described in the rationale.\n\"I am at (6,1) ... Body extending to the left at (7,1) and (8,1).\"\nWait, if I am at (6,1) and body is (7,1) and (8,1), that means the snake goes (6,1) -> (7,1) -> (8,1).\nDirection is East.\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,1):\nTarget (7,1).\nOccupied by (7,1).\n(7,1) moves to (8,1).\n(8,1) moves to (7,1).\nHead moves to (7,1).\nSo Head (7,1) and (8,1 -> 7,1) collide.\nSame problem.\n\nMaybe the game uses a different rule?\n\"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nThis implies moving into the neck is death.\nBut moving into other body parts is okay if they move?\nUsually, hitting ANY part of your own body is death.\nHowever, the \"Last Rationale\" explicitly says:\n\"RIGHT (7,1) is currently occupied... my body moves simultaneously... this move is valid.\"\nSo the game *does* allow moving into a body segment if it moves away.\nSo if I move UP to (6,1), and (6,1) moves to (6,0), it is valid.\nDoes the tail matter?\nIf the tail moves to (6,1), does it block?\nThe tail is part of the body.\nIf the tail moves to (6,1) at the same time, does it count as \"occupied\"?\nIn standard Snake rules, the tail is part of the body.\nIf the head moves to where the tail moves, they collide.\nBUT, in many game loops, the tail movement is handled such that the head can take the tail's spot if the tail moves away.\nHere, the tail is moving *into* the head's target.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nRow 1: `. A A . . . . T T . .`\nThis shows T at (6,1) and (7,1)? No, the board is 10x10.\nRow 1: `A A . . . . T T . .`\nIndices 0-9.\n0: .\n1: A\n2: A\n...\n6: T\n7: T\nSo (6,1) is T (Tail/Body).\n(7,1) is T (Body).\nSo the body is at (6,1) and (7,1).\nHead is at (6,0).\nIf I move UP to (6,1):\n(6,1) is occupied.\n(6,1) moves to (6,0).\n(7,1) moves to (6,1).\nHead moves to (6,1).\nSo head and (7,1) collide.\nIs (7,1) moving to (6,1) a collision?\nIf the game allows \"sliding\", usually no.\nIf I move UP, the snake effectively rotates the cells.\nHead -> (6,1).\n(6,1) -> (6,0).\n(7,1) -> (6,1).\nWait, if (7,1) moves to (6,1), and Head moves to (6,1), they conflict.\nUnless (7,1) becomes the new Head? No.\nLet's assume the game engine resolves this safely.\nIf `UP` is safe, it's the best move.\nIf `UP` is unsafe (Head-Tail collision), then `UP` is invalid.\nI have `LEFT` and `RIGHT` as alternatives.\n`RIGHT` puts me in the corner (7,0). Bad.\n`LEFT` puts me on the wall (5,0).\nIf `UP` is safe, I take `UP`.\nIf `UP` is unsafe, I take `LEFT`.\nLet's check `LEFT`.\nTarget (5,0).\nIs it empty? Yes.\nIs it occupied by body? No.\nSo `LEFT` is definitely safe.\nIs `UP` definitely safe?\nThere is a risk of Head-Tail collision.\nHowever, most Snake logic allows the head to move to (6,1) if (6,1) is the *immediate* next segment.\nWhy? Because the snake is contiguous.\nIf I move UP, the segment at (6,1) slides into (6,0).\nThe segment at (7,1) slides into (6,1).\nThe head slides into (6,1).\nWait, if the segment at (7,1) slides into (6,1), and the head slides into (6,1), they both try to occupy (6,1).\nThis is a conflict.\nUnless the head \"wins\" and the body segment (7,1) is \"pushed\" or something? No.\n\nLet's look at the \"Last Rationale\" again.\n\"I cannot move LEFT because that would be into my own body (7,1), causing me to die.\"\nThis was said when the head was at (6,1) and body was [(6,2), (7,1)]?\n\"I am at (6,1) with my body extending to the left at (7,1) and (8,1).\"\nWait, \"extending to the left\". This implies the body is to the *left* of the head.\nHead (6,1). Body (5,1) and (4,1)? No.\n\"extending to the left\" usually means decreasing X.\nBut the coordinates given are (7,1) and (8,1). These are *right* of 6.\n\"extending to the left at (7,1)\" is a contradiction.\nWait.\n\"Body: [(6, 1), (7, 1)]\" (Current).\n\"Last Move: DOWN\".\nPrevious state: Head (6,1).\nIf I moved DOWN, previous head was (6,1).\nNew body includes (6,1).\nSo previous body must have been [(6,2), (7,1)]?\nNo, if I moved DOWN, the new body is (Old Head, Old Neck).\nOld Head: (6,1).\nOld Neck: ?\nCurrent body: (6,1), (7,1).\nSo Old Neck was (7,1)? No, that would make the snake go (6,1) -> (7,1) -> ...\nIf I moved DOWN from (6,1), the new body is (6,1) and (Old Neck).\nSo Old Neck is (7,1)? No, (7,1) is to the right.\nIf Old Head was (6,1), and Old Neck was (7,1), then the snake was pointing RIGHT.\nMoving DOWN (0, -1) would result in:\nHead (6,0).\nBody (6,1), (7,1).\nThis is consistent.\nSo the previous state was:\nHead (6,1), Body [(7,1), (8,1)]? No, (7,1) is the neck.\nIf Neck is (7,1), Tail is (8,1).\nSo previous state: Head (6,1), Body [(7,1), (8,1)].\nI moved DOWN.\nResult: Head (6,0), Body [(6,1), (7,1)].\nCorrect.\n\nNow, in the previous turn (Head at 6,1, Body [(7,1), (8,1)]), the rationale mentioned moving RIGHT.\n\"I cannot move LEFT because that would be into my own body (7,1)\"\nIf Head is at (6,1), and Body is [(7,1), (8,1)], then LEFT is (5,1).\n(5,1) is empty.\nSo why would LEFT be death?\nWait.\n\"I am at (6,1) with my body extending to the left at (7,1) and (8,1).\"\n\"extending to the left at (7,1)\"\nThis implies (7,1) is to the left of (6,1).\nBut mathematically, 7 > 6. So it's to the right.\nMaybe the user made a typo and meant \"extending to the RIGHT\"?\nOr maybe the coordinates are (5,1) and (4,1)?\n\"Body: [(6, 1), (7, 1)]\" (Current).\nIf the body is (6,1) and (7,1), and head is (6,0), the body is to the right/up.\nThe rationale said: \"I am at (6,1) with my body extending to the left at (7,1) and (8,1).\"\nIf the body was at (5,1) and (4,1), then (4,1) is left.\nBut the current body is (6,1) and (7,1).\nIf the previous body was (7,1) and (8,1), then moving DOWN from (6,1) puts the body at (6,1) and (7,1).\nSo the body is currently (6,1) and (7,1).\nThe head is (6,0).\nIf I move UP to (6,1), I am moving into (6,1).\n(6,1) is currently occupied.\n(6,1) will move to (6,0).\n(7,1) will move to (6,1).\nHead moves to (6,1).\nSo head and tail (7,1->6,1) collide.\n\nIs there any move that is definitely safe?\n`LEFT` to (5,0) is definitely safe.\n`RIGHT` to (7,0) is definitely safe.\n`DOWN` is death.\n\nBetween `LEFT` and `RIGHT`:\n`RIGHT` goes to (7,0). This is near the top wall? No, Y=0. Bottom wall. X=7. X=9 is wall.\nSo (7,0) is near the bottom-right wall.\n`LEFT` goes to (5,0). Near bottom-left wall.\nApple at (3,0) is to the left.\nApple at (1,1) is to the left/up.\nApple at (2,3) is center/up.\nApple at (1,4) is left/up.\nApple at (0,1) is left/bottom.\nSo `LEFT` moves towards the dense apple cluster.\n`RIGHT` moves towards nothing (empty space).\n\nSo I should go `LEFT`.\nBut `UP` is tempting if it's safe.\nLet's assume the game engine handles `UP` safely.\nIf `UP` is safe, it puts me at (6,1).\nFrom (6,1), I can go to (5,1) (left) or (6,2) (up).\n(5,1) is empty.\nFrom (6,1), I can reach the apples at (2,3) and (1,4).\nFrom (5,0), I am restricted.\n\nLet's check if `UP` is definitely fatal.\nIn most Snake implementations, if the head moves into the cell immediately behind it (which would normally be the neck), it's death (backwards).\nHere, moving UP is not backwards.\nMoving into the neck (if the neck is behind) is death.\nHere, the neck is at (6,1). The head is at (6,0).\nMoving UP moves into the neck.\nIs that death?\n\"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n\"The cell directly behind your head\" is (6,1). That is the neck.\nSo moving UP is moving backwards into the neck.\nSo `UP` is death.\nWait, \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nThe cell behind the head (6,0) is (6,1).\nSo `UP` is moving backwards.\nTherefore `UP` is death.\n\nWait, why did the rationale consider UP as a valid move in the previous turn?\nPrevious turn:\nHead at (6,1).\nBody at [(6,2), (7,1)]? No, we deduced it was [(7,1), (8,1)].\nIf Head was (6,1) and body was [(7,1), (8,1)], then the neck is (7,1).\nThe cell behind (6,1) is (5,1)? No, if I want to move UP, (6,2).\nThe cell behind (6,1) (if facing UP) is (6,0).\nWait, \"behind\" means opposite of current facing?\nNo, \"directly behind your head\" means the adjacent cell that is part of your body.\nIf Head is (6,0), Body is (6,1).\n(6,1) is directly behind (6,0).\nSo moving UP to (6,1) is moving backwards.\nSo `UP` is death.\n\nSo `LEFT` and `RIGHT` are the only options.\n`LEFT` -> (5,0).\n`RIGHT` -> (7,0).\nI am at (6,0).\nApples at (3,0) is left.\nSo I should go `LEFT`.\n\nWait, let's re-read the \"Last Move Rationale\" one more time.\n\"I am at (6,1) with my body extending to the left at (7,1) and (8,1).\"\n\"LEFT (7,1) is safe\".\nThis implies the body is at (7,1) and (8,1).\nIf Head is (6,1), and body is (7,1), then the snake extends to the right (X+).\nSo \"extending to the left\" is definitely a typo for \"extending to the RIGHT\".\nSo body is to the RIGHT.\nSo if Head is (6,0) and body is (6,1), (7,1), then the body is UP and RIGHT.\nSo moving UP is backwards.\nSo `UP` is death.\n\nSo the only safe moves are `LEFT` and `RIGHT`.\n`LEFT` is towards apples.\n`RIGHT` is away.\n\nDecision: `LEFT`.\n\nWait, is there any chance `UP` is not \"backwards\"?\nIf the snake is folded?\nHead (6,0).\nBody (6,1).\nIf the snake was facing UP, then (6,1) is the neck.\nIf the snake was facing DOWN, then (6,1) would be... wait, if Head is (6,0), and it moved DOWN, it would be at (6,-1). Impossible.\nSo the snake must have moved DOWN to get to (6,0).\nSo the previous head was (6,1).\nSo the snake moved DOWN.\nSo the current facing is DOWN.\nThe cell behind the head is (6,1).\nSo moving UP is backwards.\nSo `UP` is death.\n\nSo I must go `LEFT` or `RIGHT`.\n`LEFT` is (5,0).\nThis puts me on the bottom row.\nI can then go LEFT to (4,0), LEFT to (3,0) (Apple).\nThen I can go UP or continue LEFT.\nThis seems the best path to get an apple quickly.\nThe enemy is at (4,4).\nThey can move down.\nI should be quick.\n\nSo `LEFT`.\n\nLet's double check the board.\nRow 0: `. . . A . . 1 . . .`\nApple at (3,0).\nI am at (6,0).\n(5,0) is empty.\n(4,0) is empty.\n(3,0) is Apple.\nSo `LEFT` is the path to the apple.\n\nIs there any risk of collision with Enemy?\nEnemy at (4,4).\nIf enemy moves DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, they are at (4,1).\nIf I am at (3,0), I am safe.\nIf I am at (4,0), I am safe (enemy is at 4,1).\nIf enemy moves DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, LEFT to (2,2), they might block (2,3) or (1,4).\nBut I am going for (3,0) first.\nSo `LEFT` is good.\n\nFinal check:\nMove `LEFT` to (5,0).\nTarget (5,0) is empty.\nNo collision.\nSafe.\n\nOne detail: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n`LEFT` is safe.\n`RIGHT` is safe (to 7,0).\n`UP` is death.\n`DOWN` is death.\n\nI will choose `LEFT`.\n\nWait, I should write the long-term plan as per instructions.\n\"Strategy note to your future self\"\nTarget: Apple at (3,0).\nPath: (6,0) -> (5,0) -> (4,0) -> (3,0).\nThen from (3,0), maybe (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) (Apple).\nOr (3,0) -> (3,1) -> (2,3) (Apple).\nThe enemy is at (4,4).\nAvoid the enemy.\nThe bottom row is relatively safe.\n\nMove: LEFT.\n\nWait, is there any reason to go `RIGHT`?\nIf I go `RIGHT`, I go to (7,0).\nThen I can go UP to (7,1).\n(7,1) is currently body.\nWait, if I go RIGHT to (7,0), my body is [(6,0), (6,1)].\nThe old body (6,1), (7,1) becomes (6,0), (6,1).\nWait, if I move RIGHT from (6,0) to (7,0):\nOld Head (6,0) becomes neck.\nOld Neck (6,1) becomes tail.\nSo new body: [(6,0), (6,1)].\nSo (7,1) is now empty.\nSo I can go UP to (7,1) next turn.\nFrom (7,1), I can go UP to (7,2).\nThis path is open.\nBut it leads to the empty top right corner.\n(8,0), (9,0) are dead ends.\n(7,1) is safe.\nBut I don't have apples there.\nSo `RIGHT` is bad.\n\nSo `LEFT` is the correct choice.\n\nOne thought: Is it possible that `UP` is not death because the body moves?\n\"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n\"Moving directly backwards... counts as hitting yourself.\"\nUsually, moving into the neck is death.\nIf the neck moves away, is it still death?\nIn strict snake, moving into the neck is death because it's \"backwards\".\nIn some variants, only hitting the \"old tail\" is safe.\nHere, (6,1) is the neck.\nSo `UP` is definitely death.\n\nSo `LEFT`.\n\nOne more check on `LEFT`.\nTarget (5,0).\nIs it a trap?\nNo, (4,0) is open.\n(5,1) is open (currently empty, was occupied by my tail previously? No, tail was 7,1).\nWait, current body: (6,1), (7,1).\nIf I move LEFT to (5,0), new body: (6,0), (6,1).\nSo (5,1) is empty.\nSo I have an escape route UP from (5,0) to (5,1).\nSo I am not trapped on the bottom row.\nI can always go UP.\nSo `LEFT` is safe.\n\nFinal decision: `LEFT`.\n\nPlan: Move left to (5,0) to approach the apple at (3,0). Monitor enemy position.\n\nLEFT",

Current State & Coordinates:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at `(4, 0)`. Body at `(5, 0)`, `(6, 0)`.\n    *   *Note on Discrepancy:* The ASCII board shows my head at `(6, 0)` and the Enemy at `(2, 4)`. The Text Description explicitly places my head at `(4, 0)` and the Enemy at `(2, 4)`. I will trust the explicit coordinates as they align with the move history and my intended path.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at `(2, 4)`. Body at `(3, 4)`.\n*   **Apples:** There is an apple at `(1, 1)` and `(3, 0)`. `(1, 1)` is diagonally adjacent to my head.\n\n**2. Move Elimination (Rules Check):**\n*   **Current Head:** `(4, 0)`.\n*   **My Body:** `[(5, 0), (6, 0)]`. The neck is at `(5, 0)`.\n*   **Move UP to `(4, 1)`:**\n    *   Is `(4, 1)` valid? Yes, it is on the board and not occupied by my body or the enemy.\n    *   This moves me toward the apple at `(1, 1)` and opens up movement away from the wall.\n    *   **SAFE.**\n*   **Move DOWN to `(4, -1)`:**\n    *   Off the board. **DEADLY.**\n*   **Move LEFT to `(3, 0)`:**\n    *   Target cell `(3, 0)` contains an apple (confirmed in list).\n    *   Is `(3, 0)` safe? It is on the board. I need to ensure it's not my body. My body is `(5, 0)` and `(6, 0)`. `(3, 0)` is not there. It is not the enemy's body.\n    *   **SAFE & REWARDING (Eats Apple).**\n*   **Move RIGHT to `(5, 0)`:**\n    *   Target cell `(5, 0)` is currently my neck/segment. Moving into my own body is death. **DEADLY.**\n\n**3. Strategic Comparison:**\n*   **Option LEFT:** Moves to `(3, 0)`. This eats the apple located there. It increases my score and length. It keeps me on the bottom row but allows me to continue Left (to `2,0`) or turn Up.\n*   **Option UP:** Moves to `(4, 1)`. This moves me toward the cluster of apples at `(1, 1)` and `(1, 4)`. It increases my vertical maneuverability immediately.\n\n**Decision:**\nI am currently safe on the bottom row. The apple at `(3, 0)` is immediately accessible via **LEFT**. Eating it is a low-risk, high-reward move that guarantees growth. While moving **UP** offers future flexibility, securing the guaranteed point now is the optimal play. I will collect the apple at `(3, 0)`.\n\nLEFT",

But going LEFT to (1, 4) leaves apple (2, 3) still on board for later, whereas going DOWN to (2, 3) removes it.  \nIf I go LEFT now, I can still get (2, 3) later, maybe after enemy moves away from bottom.  \n\nAlso, from (1, 4) I can go DOWN next turn to (1, 3) and then to (2, 3) if still there, or go for (0, 1)/(1, 1).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Avoid potential future trap:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (2, 3), next turn I can\u2019t go UP (body), so I\u2019m forced DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT. That\u2019s fine, but being at y=3 might not be better than y=4.  \n\nLEFT feels slightly better because it opens the left side apples while keeping (2, 3) as backup.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter LEFT to (1, 4) and eating apple, next turn from (1, 4) consider DOWN to (1, 3) to approach remaining apples (0, 1) and (2, 3). Keep enemy far in mind \u2014 they\u2019re still at bottom.  \n\nLEFT",

The description confirms `Body: [(4,0), (5,0), (6,0)]`. The head has successfully moved to `(3, 0)` (eating the apple) in Turn 10.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at `(2, 4)`.

Strategic Comparison (Left vs Up):**\n*   **Option LEFT (to `2, 0`):**\n    *   Moves closer to the apple at `(1, 1)` (Manhattan distance 2) and the open left side of the board.\n    *   Allows a future move to `(1, 0)` or `(2, 1)`.\n    *   The enemy snake is at `y=4`, far away.

It positions my head at `(2, 0)`, minimizing the distance to the apple at `(1, 1)`. It maintains access to the bottom row or allows an immediate turn Up towards `(1, 1)` on the next turn. Moving Up would unnecessarily increase distance to the nearest target.\n\nLEFT",

So apple (2, 3) will still be there unless I eat it.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nRIGHT gives immediate apple (score 3 vs enemy\u2019s 3), but reduces next turn\u2019s safe moves to 2.  \nDOWN keeps flexibility (3 safe moves next turn) and moves toward apples (1, 1) and (0, 1).  \nLEFT reduces options next turn (2 safe moves).  \n\nGiven enemy is still at length 4, I need to keep growing but also avoid traps.  \nRIGHT to eat apple now puts me equal in apples with enemy and grows length to 4, but next turn I\u2019ll be at (2, 3) with limited moves.  \nDOWN to (1, 2) keeps more options and still heads toward apples, but delays eating.  \n\nI think eating now is good because:  \n1. Equalizes apples with enemy.  \n2. Growth gives more body buffer.  \n3. From (2, 3) next turn, I can go DOWN to (2, 2) or RIGHT to (3, 3) \u2014 not terrible.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (2, 3) and eating apple, next turn go DOWN to (2, 2) to avoid trapping myself, then toward (1, 1) or (0, 1). Keep enemy in mind \u2014 they may move toward (2, 1) or (1, 0), still not close to me.  \n\nRIGHT",

Board State & Coordinates:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at `(2, 0)`.\n    *   *Note:* The board shows `1` at `(2, 0)`, `T` at `(3, 0)`, `(4, 0)`, `(5, 0)`. The description confirms `Body: [(3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)]`. The head has moved to `(2, 0)` (eating the apple at `(1, 1)` is not confirmed, but the move was made).\n    *   *Correction:* The text says \"Apples collected: 3\". The board shows apples at `(0, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, etc. If I ate an apple at `(1, 1)`, my length should be 5. The board shows length 4. Let's look at the board again.\n    *   Row 0: `. 1 T T T . . . . .`\n    *   The apple at `(1, 1)` is still on the board (Row 1 has `A A`).\n    *   Wait, the prompt says: \"Your last move... LEFT\". Result: Head at `(2, 0)`. The apple at `(1, 1)` is at distance 1 + 1 = 2.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at `(1, 3)`. Body at `(1, 4), (2, 4)`.\n    *   *Note:* The board shows `0` at `(1, 3)`, `T` at `(1, 4)`, `(2, 4)`. Consistent.\n*   **Apples:** `(0, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, `(2, 3)`, `(7, 5)`, `(4, 6)`.\n\n**2. Move Elimination (Rules Check):**\n*   **Current Head:** `(2, 0)`.\n*   **My Body:** `[(3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)]`. The neck is at `(3, 0)`.\n*   **Move UP to `(2, 1)`:**\n    *   Valid coordinates.\n    *   Cell `(2, 1)` is empty (Row 1: `A A . ...`).\n    *   **SAFE.**\n*   **Move DOWN to `(2, -1)`:**\n    *   Off the board. **DEADLY.**\n*   **Move LEFT to `(1, 0)`:**\n    *   Valid coordinates.\n    *   Cell `(1, 0)` is empty (Row 0: `. 1 ...`).\n    *   **SAFE.**\n*   **Move RIGHT to `(3, 0)`:**\n    *   Target cell `(3, 0)` is my neck. **DEADLY.**\n\n**3. Strategic Comparison (Left vs Up):**\n*   **Option UP (to `2, 1`):**\n    *   Target `(2, 1)` is empty.\n    *   This moves adjacent to the apple at `(1, 1)` (distance 1) and `(2, 3)` (distance 2).\n    *   *Threat Analysis:* Enemy head is at `(1, 3)`. Enemy is currently facing right (from `(1, 3)` to `(2, 4)` body is East). If the enemy moves `UP` to `(1, 4)`, that is into its own body (tail at `(2, 4)` is diagonal, but body is at `(1, 4)`). Wait, body is at `(1, 4)` and `(2, 4)`. If the enemy moves `UP` from `(1, 3)` to `(1, 4)`, it hits its own body segment (if it stays). However, the snake moves simultaneously. The tail leaves `(2, 4)`. The body shifts. The segment `(1, 4)` becomes the new \"tail\" waiting to leave? No, the body list is ordered.\n    *   Enemy Body: `[(1, 4), (2, 4)]`. Head `(1, 3)`.\n    *   If Enemy moves `UP`: New head `(1, 4)`. But `(1, 4)` is currently a body segment. So `UP` is deadly for Enemy.\n    *   If Enemy moves `LEFT`: `(0, 3)`. Safe.\n    *   If Enemy moves `RIGHT`: `(2, 3)`. Safe.\n    *   If Enemy moves `DOWN`: `(1, 2)`. Safe.\n    *   The apple at `(2, 3)` is a strong target. If I go `UP` to `(2, 1)`, I can chase `(2, 3)`. If I go `LEFT` to `(1, 0)`, I can chase `(1, 1)` (blocking the enemy's path) or `(0, 1)`.\n*   **Option LEFT (to `1, 0`):**\n    *   Target `(1, 0)` is empty.\n    *   Moves adjacent to apple at `(0, 1)` (diagonal, distance 2) and `(1, 1)` (distance 1).\n    *   My body blocks the path to `(0, 1)` if I turn up immediately, unless I loop around.\n    *   If I go `LEFT` -> `UP` -> `LEFT` (to `(0, 1)`), I eat the apple.\n    *   If I go `UP` -> `LEFT`, I eat `(1, 1)`.\n    *   Enemy at `(1, 3)` is 4 units away vertically. I am safe from immediate collision.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth `LEFT` and `UP` are safe.\n`UP` puts me at `(2, 1)`, adjacent to the apple at `(1, 1)` and setting up for `(2, 3)`.\n`LEFT` puts me at `(1, 0)`, setting up for `(1, 1)` (by moving `UP`) or `(0, 1)` (by moving `UP` then `LEFT`).\nThe apple at `(1, 1)` is the closest (distance 2 from current head).\nIf I go `UP` to `(2, 1)`, distance to `(1, 1)` is 1.\nIf I go `LEFT` to `(1, 0)`, distance to `(1, 1)` is 1.\nThe apple at `(0, 1)` is also a target. From `(1, 0)`, `UP` -> `LEFT` gets it. From `(2, 1)`, `LEFT` -> `LEFT` -> `DOWN` -> `LEFT` ... is awkward.\nPositioning `LEFT` to `(1, 0)` creates a potential corner if I get trapped, but `UP` to `(2, 1)` opens up the board more.\nHowever, `LEFT` moves towards the cluster of apples at `(0,1)` and `(1,1)`.\nLet's look at the board geometry.\nRow 0: `. 1 T T T . . .`\nRow 1: `A A . . .`\nIf I go `LEFT` to `(1, 0)`, I can go `UP` to `(1, 1)` (EAT) or `UP` to `(1, 1)`... wait, if I go `LEFT` to `(1, 0)`, then `UP` is `(1, 1)` which is an apple.\nIf I go `UP` to `(2, 1)`, then `LEFT` is `(1, 1)` which is an apple.\nBoth get to `(1, 1)` in 2 moves.\nIf I go `LEFT` to `(1, 0)`, I can potentially go `UP` -> `LEFT` -> `DOWN` to `(0, 1)`.\nIf I go `UP` to `(2, 1)`, I can go `LEFT` -> `LEFT` (to `(0, 1)`).\nActually, `(2, 1)` -> `LEFT` -> `LEFT` -> `DOWN` is `(0, 0)` then `(0, 1)`.\nWait, `(0, 1)` is an apple.\n`(2, 1)` -> `LEFT` (1, 1) is empty (if I don't eat it). Then `LEFT` (0, 1) is Apple.\nSo `UP` puts me on a direct path to `(1, 1)` then `(0, 1)`.\n`LEFT` puts me on a direct path to `(1, 1)` (from `(1, 0)`) then `(0, 1)`.\nLet's look at the Enemy. Enemy is at `(1, 3)`. If I go `LEFT` to `(1, 0)`, I am directly below the enemy. If the enemy goes `DOWN` twice, it gets to `(1, 1)`. But I can get there in 1 move.\nIf I go `UP` to `(2, 1)`, I am not directly below the enemy.\nAlso, if I go `LEFT`, I am closer to `(0, 1)`.\nI prefer `LEFT` to secure the bottom row and the `(0, 1)` apple.\n\nWait, looking at the board again.\nIf I go `LEFT` to `(1, 0)`:\nNext turn: I can go `UP` to `(1, 1)` (Apple). Safe.\nIf I go `UP` to `(2, 1)`:\nNext turn: I can go `LEFT` to `(1, 1)` (Apple). Safe.\nThe `(0, 1)` apple is at x=0. I am at x=2. Going `LEFT` reduces x. Going `UP` keeps x=2.\nGoing `LEFT` is better to reach `(0, 1)` eventually.\nHowever, `(1, 1)` is an immediate adjacent target.\nLet's look at the Enemy's options regarding `(1, 1)`.\nEnemy at `(1, 3)`. To get to `(1, 1)`, it must go `DOWN` twice.\nI am at `(2, 0)`. To get to `(1, 1)`, I can go `LEFT` then `UP`.\nIf I go `LEFT` now, I am at `(1, 0)`. Next turn `UP` is `(1, 1)` (Apple).\nIf the Enemy goes `DOWN` this turn to `(1, 2)`, and next turn `DOWN` to `(1, 1)`, we might collide.\nSimultaneous move:\nTurn 12: Me `LEFT` -> `(1, 0)`. Enemy `DOWN` -> `(1, 2)`.\nTurn 13: Me `UP` -> `(1, 1)`. Enemy `DOWN` -> `(1, 1)`.\nHead-on collision. We both die.\nThis is a risk.\nIf I go `UP` to `(2, 1)`:\nTurn 12: Me `UP` -> `(2, 1)`. Enemy `DOWN` -> `(1, 2)`.\nTurn 13: Me `LEFT` -> `(1, 1)`. Enemy `DOWN` -> `(1, 1)`.\nHead-on collision again.\nSo it's symmetric regarding collision with Enemy on `(1, 1)`.\nHowever, if Enemy goes `RIGHT` or `LEFT`, it doesn't threaten `(1, 1)`.\nThe enemy has 2 apples. I have 3. I don't *need* to risk a head-on collision.\nBut I need apples to win.\nIf I go `LEFT`, I am effectively claiming the left side.\nLet's check the `UP` move again.\nIf I go `UP` to `(2, 1)`:\nI am at `x=2`. Enemy at `x=1`.\nIf Enemy goes `DOWN`, we are at `(2, 1)` and `(1, 2)`. Diagonal. Safe.\nIf Enemy goes `DOWN` -> `DOWN`, we meet at `(1, 1)`.\nI need to be careful.\nThe apple at `(0, 1)` is 2 steps away from `(1, 0)`.\nThe apple at `(0, 1)` is 3 steps away from `(2, 1)`.\nThe apple at `(1, 1)` is 1 step away from `(1, 0)`.\nThe apple at `(1, 1)` is 1 step away from `(2, 1)`.\nActually, from `(2, 1)`, `LEFT` is `(1, 1)`. From `(1, 0)`, `UP` is `(1, 1)`.\nSo `(2, 1)` is as close to `(1, 1)` as `(1, 0)`.\nBut `(2, 1)` is further from `(0, 1)`.\nIf I go `LEFT` to `(1, 0)`, I am at the wall. This limits my escape routes if the enemy chases me. If I go `UP` to `(2, 1)`, I have open space to the right and top.\nI think `UP` is safer regarding wall traps. Being at `x=1` on the bottom row (y=0) is risky if the enemy comes down. Being at `x=2, y=1` allows me to move to `x=3` or `x=2, y=2`.\nAlso, the apple at `(2, 3)` is straight up from `(2, 1)`.\nIf I go `UP` to `(2, 1)`, then `UP` to `(2, 2)`, then `UP` to `(2, 3)` (Apple).\nSo `UP` puts me on a path to `2` apples: `(1, 1)` and `(2, 3)`.\n`LEFT` puts me on a path to `(1, 1)` and `(0, 1)`.\nThe path to `(2, 3)` is clear vertical.\nThe path to `(0, 1)` requires navigating corners.\nI will choose `UP` to maintain board center control and access to the vertical apple stack.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1.  Move UP to (2, 1) to position for the (1, 1) apple and the vertical line of apples at (2, 3).\n2.  Monitor enemy movement. If enemy moves down towards (1, 1), consider moving to (2, 2) to bypass and take (2, 3) first, or engage if safe.\n3.  Avoid getting trapped against the left wall. Keep the option to move right open.\n\nLEFT",

Board State & Coordinates:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at `(1, 0)`.\n    *   Body: `[(2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)]`.\n    *   Apples: 3.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at `(1, 3)`.\n    *   Body: `[(1, 4), (2, 4)]`.\n    *   Apples: 3.\n*   **Apples:** `(0, 1)`, `(1, 1)`, `(7, 5)`, `(4, 6)`, `(5, 7)`.\n    *   Note: The apple at `(2, 3)` has vanished, likely eaten by the enemy in Turn 12 (enemy head moved from `(2, 3)` to `(1, 3)`? No, enemy was at `(1, 3)`. Wait. The enemy was at `(1, 3)` in the previous turn. If the apple at `(2, 3)` is gone, the enemy must have moved to `(2, 3)` in Turn 12 and grown, then moved back or something? No. The previous state had Enemy at `(2, 3)`? No, \"Enemy Snake (ID 0): Head: (2, 3)\" in the previous prompt? No. Wait, let's re-read the prompt.\n    *   Previous Turn 12 prompt: \"Enemy Snake (ID 0): Head: (2, 3)...\"\n    *   My last move was LEFT. Moving from `(2, 0)` to `(1, 0)`.\n    *   Enemy was at `(2, 3)`.\n    *   Enemy could have moved to `(1, 3)` (LEFT). The current prompt says \"Enemy Snake (ID 0): Head: (1, 3)\". Yes, consistent.\n    *   Did the enemy eat the apple at `(2, 3)`? The apple list for Turn 12 included `(2, 3)`. The current list does not. The prompt says \"Apples at: (0, 1), (1, 1), (7, 5), (4, 6), (5, 7)\". The apple at `(2, 3)` is gone. Therefore, the enemy must have moved into `(2, 3)`? No, the enemy was at `(2, 3)`? No, the enemy was at `(2, 3)` in the *description* of the state, but the *board* showed `0` at `(1, 3)`? Let's re-read the previous prompt's board.\n        *   Previous Board: Row 3: `. T 0 . . .`. This means Enemy at `(2, 3)`? No, indices: `0 1 2 3 ...`. Row 3: col 0 `.`, col 1 `T`, col 2 `0`. So Head was at `(2, 3)`. Wait, the text said \"Head: (2, 3)\". Yes.\n        *   Current Board Row 3: `. T 0 . . .`. Wait, the current board shows `T` at `(1, 3)` and `0` at `(2, 3)`? No.\n        *   Current Board:\n            Row 4: `. T T . . . .`\n            Row 3: `. T 0 . . . .`\n            Index: `0 1 2 ...`\n            Row 3: `.` (0), `T` (1), `0` (2).\n            So Head is at `(2, 3)`? No, the prompt says \"Head: (1, 3)\".\n            Let's look at the *text* of the current prompt: \"Enemy Snake (ID 0): Head: (1, 3)\".\n            Let's look at the *board* of the current prompt: Row 3: `. T 0 . . .`. `T` is at index 1 (`x=1`), `0` is at index 2 (`x=2`).\n            This implies the head is at `(2, 3)` if `0` is the head, or `(1, 3)` if `T` is the head.\n            The prompt says \"Head: (1, 3)\".\n            If Head is `(1, 3)`, the character at `(1, 3)` should be `0`.\n            But the board shows `T` at `(1, 3)` and `0` at `(2, 3)`.\n            **Contradiction.**\n            Let's trust the text description of coordinates over the ASCII art if they conflict, or check closely.\n            ASCII: `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`\n            Row 3: `. T 0 . . . . . . .`\n            Col 1: `T`. Col 2: `0`.\n            If `0` is the head, head is at `(2, 3)`.\n            If `T` is the head, head is at `(1, 3)`.\n            The prompt says: \"Enemy Snake (ID 0): Head: (1, 3), Body: [(1, 4), (2, 4)]\".\n            Wait, if Head is `(1, 3)`, then Body is `(1, 4), (2, 4)`.\n            On the board:\n            Row 3: `. T 0 .`\n            Row 4: `. T T .`\n            If `0` is head, head is `(2, 3)`. Body `(1, 4), (2, 4)`. Then `(1, 4)` is `T`. `(2, 4)` is `T`. Correct.\n            So the board says Head is at `(2, 3)`. The text says Head is at `(1, 3)`.\n            Let's check the previous turn's text vs board.\n            Previous Text: \"Head: (2, 3)\"\n            Previous Board: Row 3: `. T 0 .` -> Head at `(2, 3)`.\n            Current Text: \"Head: (1, 3)\"\n            Current Board: Row 3: `. T 0 .` -> Head at `(2, 3)`.\n            **The text of the current state says Head is (1, 3), but the board shows `0` at (2, 3).**\n            This is a discrepancy.\n            **Correction:** The board is usually the source of truth for positions. If the board shows `0` at `(2, 3)`, then the head is at `(2, 3)`.\n            However, the prompt explicitly states: \"Enemy Snake (ID 0): Head: (1, 3)\". I must assume the text is correct and the board might be slightly delayed or the representation is tricky.\n            Let's assume the text is correct: Enemy Head at `(1, 3)`.\n            Let's assume the text is wrong and the board is correct: Enemy Head at `(2, 3)`.\n            If Head is `(1, 3)`, where is the body?\n            Text says: Body: `[(1, 4), (2, 4)]`.\n            Board Row 4: `. T T .`.\n            `(1, 4)` is `T`. `(2, 4)` is `T`. Matches.\n            Board Row 3: `. T 0 .`.\n            `(1, 3)` is `T`. `(2, 3)` is `0`.\n            If Head is `(1, 3)`, then `(1, 3)` should be `0`. It is `T`.\n            If Head is `(2, 3)`, then `(2, 3)` should be `0`. It is `0`.\n            **Conclusion:** The text \"Head: (1, 3)\" is likely a typo for \"Head: (2, 3)\" or the board is misaligned. Given the `0` is at `(2, 3)`, I will assume the Enemy Head is actually at `(2, 3)` based on the board.\n            **Wait.** Let's look at the prompt again.\n            \"Enemy Snake (ID 0): Head: (1, 3), Body: [(1, 4), (2, 4)]\"\n            \"Board state: ... 3 . T 0 . ...\"\n            If I assume the text is correct (Head=(1, 3)), then the board visual for Row 3 is wrong (should be `0 T ...` or `0 ... T`?).\n            Let's check the coordinates. `(1, 3)` is x=1, y=3. `(2, 3)` is x=2, y=3.\n            Row 3: Index 1 is `T`, Index 2 is `0`.\n            It is highly probable the head is at `(2, 3)`.\n            Let's assume the text typo is `Head: (2, 3)` instead of `(1, 3)`.\n            If the text is \"Head: (1, 3)\" but the board shows `0` at `(2, 3)`, I will trust the board visualization for movement safety.\n            **Let's re-read carefully.**\n            \"Enemy Snake (ID 0): Head: (1, 3), Body: [(1, 4), (2, 4)]\"\n            If the head is at (1,3), the body is at (1,4) and (2,4).\n            The board has `T` at (1,3), `0` at (2,3).\n            This implies the board has the `0` shifted right by one compared to the text.\n            OR, the text is: Head (2,3). Body (1,4), (2,4).\n            Let's look at my apple count vs enemy.\n            \"Your snake (ID 1) apples: 3\"\n            \"Snake #0 apples: 3\"\n            Tie.\n            \"Turn: 13 / 150\"\n\n            **Let's assume the Enemy Head is at (2, 3) because that's where the '0' is on the board.**\n            My Head: (1, 0).\n            Enemy Head: (2, 3).\n            Apples: (0, 1), (1, 1), (7, 5), (4, 6), (5, 7).\n\n            **2. Move Elimination:**\n            *   My Neck: (2, 0).\n            *   **UP (1, 1):**\n                *   Is it an apple? Yes, `(1, 1)` is an apple.\n                *   Is it safe? Yes, empty.\n                *   Does it move backwards? No (Neck is (2, 0)).\n            *   **DOWN (1, -1):** Off board. **DEAD.**\n            *   **LEFT (0, 0):**\n                *   Is it safe? Yes, empty (Board row 0: `. 1 ...` -> index 0 is `.`).\n                *   Does it move backwards? No.\n            *   **RIGHT (2, 0):**\n                *   Target (2, 0) is my neck. **DEAD.**\n\n            **3. Strategic Comparison (UP vs LEFT):**\n            *   **Option UP (to 1, 1):**\n                *   Immediate gain: Eat apple at `(1, 1)`.\n                *   Length becomes 5.\n                *   Score: 4.\n                *   Position: (1, 1).\n                *   Next moves: UP (1,2), DOWN (1,0) (neck), LEFT (0,1) (Apple), RIGHT (2,1).\n                *   Enemy at (2, 3). Distance 2. He is above me.\n                *   If Enemy moves DOWN (to 2, 2), we are getting closer.\n            *   **Option LEFT (to 0, 0):**\n                *   No apple.\n                *   Length remains 4.\n                *   Score: 3.\n                *   Position: (0, 0).\n                *   Next moves: UP (0,1) (Apple), RIGHT (1,0) (Neck).\n                *   Escape options limited (corner).\n\n            **Comparison:**\n            Taking the apple at `(1, 1)` is the obvious choice.\n            If I go UP, I eat the apple. I grow. I am at (1, 1).\n            If I go LEFT, I don't eat. I stay small.\n            Since I am tied in score (3-3), eating is important to pull ahead.\n            Also, (1, 1) is directly adjacent.\n            Is there any danger in going UP?\n            Enemy at (2, 3).\n            If Enemy moves DOWN to (2, 2), no collision.\n            If Enemy moves LEFT to (1, 3), no collision.\n            If Enemy moves LEFT then DOWN... etc.\n            The only immediate danger is a head-on collision at (1, 1).\n            Could the enemy reach (1, 1) in one turn?\n            Enemy is at (2, 3). (1, 1) is 1 step left and 2 steps down. Manhattan distance is 3. Impossible in one turn.\n            So (1, 1) is safe from immediate enemy capture.\n            What about my own body?\n            My body: (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0). Moving to (1, 1) is safe.\n            What about wall? (1, 1) is not wall.\n            So, UP is safe and gains an apple.\n            LEFT is safe but gains nothing.\n            Therefore, UP is strictly better.\n\n            **Wait, did I already eat (1, 1)?**\n            My score is 3.\n            Previous state: Apples at (0, 1), (1, 1)...\n            If I had eaten it, score would be 4.\n            The board shows `A` at (1, 1).\n            So I have not eaten it yet.\n            Correct. I can eat it now.\n\n            **Long-term plan:**\n            1.  Move UP to (1, 1) and eat the apple.\n            2.  From (1, 1), I will likely target (0, 1) or (2, 3). (2, 3) is far. (0, 1) is close.\n            3.  Be aware of the enemy at (2, 3). If he moves down aggressively, I might need to maneuver. But for now, I secure the point.\n\n            **Check:**\n            \"If I go UP...\"\n            Target: (1, 1).\n            Board: Row 1 has `A A ...` at index 0 and 1. So (1, 1) is `A`.\n            Correct.\n            \"If I go LEFT...\"\n            Target: (0, 0).\n            Board: Row 0 has `.` at index 0.\n            Correct.\n\n            Final decision: UP to eat the apple.\n\n            *Self-correction on Enemy position text vs board.*\n            Even if the enemy is at (1, 3) (text) or (2, 3) (board), (1, 1) is safe.\n            Distance from (1, 3) to (1, 1) is 2. Safe.\n            Distance from (2, 3) to (1, 1) is 3. Safe.\n            So regardless of the discrepancy, UP is safe.\n\n            **Rationale Summary:**\n            - My head is at (1, 0).\n            - My body is at (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0).\n            - Apple at (1, 1).\n            - Moves:\n              - DOWN: Off board (Dead).\n              - RIGHT: Into my neck (Dead).\n              - LEFT: Safe (0, 0), no apple.\n              - UP: Safe (1, 1), Eats apple.\n            - Choosing UP to gain points and grow.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Good mobility.  \n\nBoth give 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Strategic considerations**  \nEnemy is far left and will likely eat apple (0, 1) if it goes DOWN, increasing its lead to 5 apples.  \nI need to catch up.  \nUP moves toward (4, 6) and (5, 7) cluster.  \nRIGHT moves toward (7, 5) and (8, 4).  \n(4, 6) is closer and safer from enemy\u2019s position.  \nAlso, UP keeps me more central, giving more options later.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP is safe, good mobility next turn, moves toward closest apple cluster, no head-on risk.  \nI\u2019ll choose UP to progress toward apples while keeping options open.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 4), enemy likely at (0, 1) or (0, 3).

Moving LEFT would take me to x=-1, which is outside the board. This results in immediate death.\n2.  **UP**: The target cell is `(0, 3)`. According to the board state, `(0, 3)` is empty (the 'T' at `(1, 3)` is at x=1, not x=0). I must also check the enemy snake's potential moves. The enemy snake #0 is at `(3, 3)`. If the enemy moves DOWN to `(3, 2)`, it hits its own body. If it moves UP to `(3, 4)`, it is safe. If it moves LEFT to `(2, 3)`, it hits its own body. If it moves RIGHT to `(4, 3)`, it is safe. If the enemy moves RIGHT to `(4, 3)`, I am safe at `(0, 3)`. However, I must also consider if the enemy could move LEFT to `(2, 3)`? Wait, `(2, 3)` is occupied by the enemy's body. So the enemy cannot move LEFT.\n    *   Enemy potential moves:\n        *   UP to `(3, 4)`: Safe.\n        *   DOWN to `(3, 2)`: Hits own body (dead).\n        *   LEFT to `(2, 3)`: Hits own body (dead).\n        *   RIGHT to `(4, 3)`: Safe.\n    *   If the enemy moves UP or RIGHT, I am safe at `(0, 3)`.\n    *   However, let's re-read the prompt. \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies.\" This implies I survive if they hit me, but I want to avoid them hitting me if I want to eat an apple later. But for this turn, just survival is key.\n    *   Actually, wait. The enemy is at `(3, 3)`. I am at `(0, 2)`. The distance is large. I am safe from head-on collision.\n    *   But wait.

There is an apple at `(0, 1)`!\n        LEFT is `(-1, 2)`. Out of bounds.\n\n3.  **DOWN**: Target `(0, 1)`. The board shows 'A' at `(0, 1)`. This is an apple.\n    *   Is it safe?\n    *   Enemy is at `(3, 3)`.\n    *   My body: `(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0)`.\n    *   Moving DOWN to `(0, 1)` is adjacent to my body at `(1, 1)` and `(1, 0)` and `(0, 0)`? No, `(0, 0)` is empty according to the map: `(0, 0)` is `.` (the `T` at row 0 is at `1, 0` and `2, 0`).\n    *   So `(0, 1)` is an apple.\n    *   Is it safe from the enemy? The enemy is far away.\n    *   Is it safe from myself? Yes.\n    *   Is it safe from walls? Yes.\n\n4.  **RIGHT**: Target `(1, 2)`. This is my own body (part of the list `[(1, 2), (1, 1), ...]`). I die.\n\n**Summary of Moves:**\n- **LEFT**: Dies (Out of bounds).\n- **RIGHT**: Dies (Self collision).\n- **UP**: Safe. Empty space.\n- **DOWN**: Safe. Contains an apple (Growth + Point).\n\n**Strategy:**\nI should take the apple. I am currently at 4 apples. The enemy is at 3 apples. Eating this apple puts me at 5 apples and makes me bigger, which is advantageous. The move DOWN is safe immediately (not hitting wall or self) and allows me to eat.\n\nIs there any risk?\nIf I move DOWN to `(0, 1)`:\n- My new head: `(0, 1)`.\n- My new body: `[(0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0)]` (I grow, so the tail `(2, 0)` stays for one turn).\n- Enemy moves.\n- Potential danger: The enemy is at `(3, 3)`. It cannot reach me in one turn. The apples are at `(0, 1), (7, 5), (4, 6), (5, 7), (8, 4)`.\n- I will eat `(0, 1)`.\n- Next turn I will be at `(0, 1)` with body extending to `(1, 1)`.\n- This looks like a good move.\n\nLet's double check the \"Last Move\" context.\nThe last move was LEFT from `(1, 2)` to `(0, 2)`.\nMy current head is `(0, 2)`.\nMy body is `[(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0)]`.\nWait, the prompt says: \"Your snake (ID: 1): - Head: (0, 2) - Body: [(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0)]\".\nThis means the list provided is head-to-tail.\nSo:\nIndex 0: Head `(0, 2)`\nIndex 1: `(1, 2)`\nIndex 2: `(1, 1)`\nIndex 3: `(1, 0)`\nIndex 4: `(2, 0)` (Tail)\n\nIf I move DOWN to `(0, 1)`:\n- New Head: `(0, 1)`\n- New Body: `[(0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0)]` (I grow by 1, so I don't remove the tail `(2, 0)` immediately? No, in snake, you grow *by* one. So you add a segment. The old tail remains, but the new body list length increases by 1).\nWait, standard snake rules:\n- Head moves to new spot.\n- New segment added (if apple eaten).\n- If no apple, tail is removed.\n- If apple, tail stays (so body lengthens by 1).\n\nSo if I eat `(0, 1)`:\nNew body: `[(0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0)]`.\nAll these coordinates are safe. `(0, 1)` was empty/apple.\n\nLet's re-read the board carefully.\nRow 1: `A T . . . . . . . .`\nCoordinates: (0,1) is 'A'.\nSo yes, DOWN is the move.\n\nIs there any reason not to take the apple?\nThe enemy has 3 apples. I have 4.\nIf I take this, I have 5.\nThe enemy might move to get an apple.\nApples are at:\n(0, 1) - I'm taking this.\n(7, 5)\n(4, 6)\n(5, 7)\n(8, 4)\n\nIf I don't take the apple (and go UP instead), I am safe. But I miss the point.\nIf I take the apple (DOWN), I am safe.\nWhy would UP be bad? It's not bad, just less rewarding.\nIs DOWN safe from the enemy's head?\nThe enemy is at (3, 3). I am at (0, 2). My target is (0, 1).\nThe enemy cannot hit me.\nIs there a possibility of a head-on collision?\nNo.\nIs there a possibility of a trap?\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 1), my body will be at (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0).\nNext turn I am at (0, 1).\nWhere can I go?\n- UP to (0, 2) -> Hit my own body (tail).\n- LEFT to (-1, 1) -> Wall.\n- RIGHT to (1, 1) -> My own body. Dead.\n- DOWN to (0, 0) -> Is it safe? Board shows (0, 0) is `.`. Is it safe from my body? (1, 0) is in my body. (0, 1) is my head. So (0, 0) is safe.\nSo, if I go DOWN to (0, 1), next turn I must go DOWN to (0, 0) to avoid hitting myself.\nThen from (0, 0), I can only go RIGHT to (1, 0). But (1, 0) is my body. Dead.\nWait, at (0, 0):\n- UP -> (0, 1) (Head)\n- LEFT -> (-1, 0) (Wall)\n- RIGHT -> (1, 0) (Body)\n- DOWN -> (0, -1) (Wall)\n\nSo going DOWN to (0, 1) corners me at (0, 0) on the next turn? No, if I go DOWN to (0, 1) today, tomorrow I am at (0, 1).\nTomorrow I can go DOWN to (0, 0).\nThe day after tomorrow, I am at (0, 0).\nAt (0, 0):\n- UP is (0, 1) (My head)\n- LEFT is out\n- RIGHT is (1, 0) (My body)\n- DOWN is out\nI die in 2 turns unless I turn around. But I can't turn around.\nWait, let's trace the body.\nCurrent: Head (0, 2), Body [(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0)].\nMove DOWN: Head (0, 1). Body [(0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0)].\nNext turn (Turn 17):\nHead (0, 1).\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 0):\nNew Body: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0)].\nNow I am at (0, 0).\nTurn 18:\nHead (0, 0).\nNeighbors:\n- (0, 1): My body.\n- (-1, 0): Wall.\n- (1, 0): My body (part of [(1, 0), (2, 0)]).\n- (0, -1): Wall.\nI die.\n\nSo if I go DOWN to the apple at (0, 1), I will be trapped in the bottom-left corner and die in 2 turns (Turn 18).\nHowever, maybe I can shed the tail?\nWait, the tail is (2, 0).\nThe body chain is (0, 0) -> (1, 0) -> ... -> (2, 0).\nIf I can move the tail out of the way...\nThe tail is fixed at (2, 0) unless I grow.\nIf I eat an apple, I grow.\nIf I don't eat, the tail moves.\nI just ate at (0, 1).\nSo on Turn 17 (at 0, 1), I did not eat (no apple there). So I shrink.\nBody: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0)].\nThe tail was (2, 0). It moves off (2, 0) to (1, 0).\nWait, the tail moves to connect to the next segment.\nThe chain is (0, 1) -> (0, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0).\nSo (2, 0) is now empty.\nTurn 18: I am at (0, 0).\nWait, I am at (0, 1) on Turn 17.\nI move to (0, 0).\nBody becomes: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1)].\nWait, I ate on Turn 16.\nSo on Turn 17, I don't eat (unless there is an apple at 0,0, which there isn't).\nSo the tail (2, 0) is removed.\nSo on Turn 17, Body: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0)].\nOn Turn 18, I am at (0, 0).\nBody: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1)].\nAt (0, 0):\n- UP: (0, 1) (Body)\n- LEFT: Wall\n- RIGHT: (1, 0) (Wait, is (1, 0) in the body?)\nBody is (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0)? No.\nOn Turn 18, before I move, my body is from Turn 17.\nTurn 17 Head: (0, 1). Body: (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0).\nTurn 18 Head: (0, 0).\nNew Body: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1).\nSo (1, 0) is now empty!\nSo from (0, 0), I can go RIGHT to (1, 0).\nIs (1, 0) safe? Yes, it's empty.\nSo I can survive the corner!\n\nLet's re-verify the escape path.\nTurn 16: Move DOWN to (0, 1). Eat apple. Body: (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0).\nTurn 17: Move DOWN to (0, 0). No apple. Body: (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0).\nTurn 18: Move RIGHT to (1, 0). (From 0,0). Body: (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1).\nTurn 19: Move RIGHT to (2, 0). (From 1,0). Body: (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2).\nTurn 20: Move UP to (2, 1). (From 2,0). etc.\n\nSo the move DOWN is safe and allows me to eat.\n\nWhat about UP?\nMove UP to (0, 3).\nBody: (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0).\nTurn 17: I am at (0, 3).\nCan I go LEFT? No.\nCan I go UP? (0, 4). Empty.\nCan I go RIGHT? (1, 3). Board shows (1, 3) is 'T'. Wait, where is the 'T'?\nRow 2: `1 T T T ...` -> (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2).\nRow 3: `... T 0 ...` -> (2, 3), (3, 3).\nRow 1: `A T ...` -> (0, 1), (1, 1).\nRow 0: `. T T ...` -> (1, 0), (2, 0).\nSo (1, 3) is NOT 'T'. It is '.'.\nSo (1, 3) is safe?\nWait, Enemy is at (3, 3).\nIf I go UP to (0, 3), I am safe.\nBut if I go UP, I don't get the point.\nI have 4 points. Enemy has 3.\nIf I get the point at (0, 1), I have 5.\nGetting points is the goal.\n\nIs there any danger in taking the apple?\nThe enemy moves at the same time.\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 1).\nEnemy is at (3, 3).\nCould the enemy move to block me or hit me?\nNo, they are too far.\nCould I hit the enemy?\nNo.\n\nSo, is the move UP safer than DOWN?\nUP keeps me away from the wall.\nDOWN puts me near the wall, but I can escape as shown.\nHowever, the prompt says: \"prefer moves that both: * increase your chance of safely eating apples, and * keep future options open\".\nDOWN gives me an apple immediately. UP does not.\nHowever, UP might offer more space.\nBut I have a safe escape route from DOWN.\nAlso, the enemy has 3 apples. I need to stay ahead.\n\nLet's consider the \"Last Move\" context again.\nMy head is at (0, 2).\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 1).\nNext turn I am at (0, 0).\nThen I go RIGHT to (1, 0).\nThen I go RIGHT to (2, 0).\nThen I go UP to (2, 1).\nIs (2, 1) safe?\nCurrent body on that turn will be long.\nLet's check if there are other apples.\nApples: (7, 5), (4, 6), (5, 7), (8, 4).\nThese are far away.\n(0, 1) is right there.\n\nIs there any scenario where DOWN kills me?\nMaybe the enemy moves LEFT? They can't, their body is there.\nMaybe the enemy moves DOWN? They can't, their body is there.\nMaybe the enemy moves UP? They go to (3, 4).\nMaybe the enemy moves RIGHT? They go to (4, 3).\nNone of these affect me.\n\nWait, I must check for head-on collisions carefully.\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 1).\nIf the enemy goes... nowhere near me.\nSo I am safe.\n\nIs there a risk of running into my own body?\nHead (0, 2). Body starts at (1, 2).\nDOWN is (0, 1).\n(0, 1) is empty (apple).\nSo I move into an empty cell.\nNext turn I am at (0, 1).\nMy body is (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0).\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 0), I hit nothing.\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 1), I hit my body.\nIf I go UP to (0, 2), I hit my body.\nSo from (0, 1), I must go DOWN to (0, 0).\nFrom (0, 0), I must go RIGHT to (1, 0).\nFrom (1, 0), I must go UP to (1, 1) or RIGHT to (2, 0)?\n(1, 0) -> Body (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1).\nWait, (1, 1) is in the body.\nSo from (1, 0), I can go RIGHT to (2, 0).\n(2, 0) is currently in the body (tail is (2, 0) initially).\nBy the time I reach (1, 0), the tail (2, 0) has moved.\nSo (2, 0) will be free.\nSo the path is safe.\n\nThe only downside is that I am forced into a loop for a few turns.\nBut getting the point is worth it.\n\nLet's compare with UP.\nIf I go UP to (0, 3).\nI am at (0, 3).\nNext turn: (0, 4). Empty.\nNext: (0, 5). Empty.\nNext: (0, 6). Empty.\nNext: (0, 7). Empty.\nNext: (0, 8). Empty.\nNext: (0, 9). Empty.\nI can just go straight up.\nBut there are no apples there.\nThe nearest apple after (0, 1) is (4, 6).\nGoing UP puts me further away from (4, 6) compared to staying at (0, 2).\nActually, (0, 2) is closer to (4, 6) than (0, 9) is.\nSo going UP doesn't help me get other apples.\nGoing DOWN gets me one apple and leaves me at (0, 0) eventually, from where I can turn right and head towards the center/apples.\nActually, if I go DOWN, I end up at (1, 0), then (2, 0), then (2, 1), etc.\nThis puts me in the bottom left, but ready to move right.\nIf I go UP, I go to the top left.\nThe apples are at (4,6), (5,7), (7,5), (8,4).\nThese are in the center/right-top.\nThe apple at (0,1) is an outlier.\nBut it's a free point.\n\nIs there any reason I cannot go DOWN?\n\"Your head moves into any snake's body\" -> (0, 1) is empty/apple. Safe.\n\"Outside the board\" -> (0, 1) is inside. Safe.\n\nSo, DOWN is safe and profitable.\n\nWait, I should double check the \"Last Move Rationale\" provided in the prompt.\nIt says: \"My head is at `(1, 2)`\". Wait, the prompt says \"Head: (0, 2)\". The rationale provided in the prompt is from the *previous* turn.\nIn the previous turn (Turn 15), the head was at `(1, 2)`.\nThe move made was LEFT.\nSo the head moved to `(0, 2)`.\nThis matches the current board state.\n\nSo, the decision for Turn 16 is correct.\n\nOne final check on the enemy.\nSnake #0: Head (3, 3). Body (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3).\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n- UP (3, 4): Empty? Board shows row 4: `... . A .` -> (8, 4) is A. (3, 4) is `.`. Safe.\n- DOWN (3, 2): Own body. Dead.\n- LEFT (2, 3): Own body. Dead.\n- RIGHT (4, 3): Empty. Safe.\n\nSo the enemy will likely go UP or RIGHT.\nNeither threatens me.\n\nTherefore, the move DOWN is safe and gives an apple.\n\nLong-term plan:\nTake the apple at (0, 1). Then navigate out of the bottom-left corner (0,0 -> 1,0 -> 2,0 -> ...).

Plan to go UP toward (4, 6), but check safety and possible enemy moves (enemy may go UP from (0, 0) to (0, 1) or RIGHT to (1, 0) \u2013 both far).

The list shows head at (0,0) and body as [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0)], so my full snake is: (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (1,0).\n\nLast move was DOWN, meaning I moved from (0,1) to (0,0). So the head is now at (0,0).\n\nLet me check available moves from (0,0):\n- UP: To (0,1) - but that's the cell directly behind my head (my neck), so this would be moving backwards into myself. That's suicide.\n- DOWN: To (0,-1) - that's outside the board (y < 0). Suicide.\n- LEFT: To (-1,0) - that's outside the board (x < 0). Suicide.\n- RIGHT: To (1,0) - this is currently my tail! Looking at the body list, (1,0) is the last element (tail).\n\nNow, I need to understand what happens when I move onto my tail. If the tail doesn't move (i.e., I'm not growing this turn), then moving into the tail cell is safe because the tail will move away. But if I'm growing, then the tail stays and I'd collide.\n\nThis turn, I'm not on an apple at (0,0), so I won't grow. Therefore, moving RIGHT to (1,0) should be safe - the tail will move forward to (1,1), leaving (1,0) empty for my head to move into.\n\nLet me verify: If I move RIGHT:\n- Head moves from (0,0) to (1,0)\n- The body shifts: the new body becomes [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,1)]\n- The tail (1,0) moves away, so no collision\n\nThis is the classic \"chase your tail\" move. It's safe and I'm currently trapped in a corner at (0,0) with only one valid move.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (4,4) heading somewhere (they'll move this turn), but they're far away and don't affect my immediate survival.\n\nApples to target later: I need to get out of this corner.

I'm currently at 5 apples, snake #0 is at 3, so I have the lead. I need to survive and keep collecting.\n\nRIGHT",

Since I didn't eat an apple, the tail will move, so the cell at (1,2) will be freed. The snake body effectively occupies [(1,1), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)] for the purpose of the next move (head determines impact).\n\nI am currently at the edge of my own body. Let's analyze valid moves:\n1.  **DOWN**: Target (1,0). This cell is currently occupied by the second segment of my body. Since the snake is moving forward (length 6), the tail at (1,2) will move to (0,2) (or wait, list is head->tail: H(1,1), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (0,2). So tail is (0,2)). If I move DOWN to (1,0), I am moving into the old position of the 2nd segment. The tail moves to (0,2) or (0,1)? Let's trace: Head (1,1) -> (1,0). The old body was (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (0,2). The new tail becomes (0,2). The cell (1,0) becomes the new head. The cell previously at (1,0) is the old 2nd segment. Since the 2nd segment moves to where the 3rd was, and so on, (1,0) is safe to move to because it is vacated by the shifting body. **Wait**, looking at the rule: \"If your head moves into any snake's body, you die.\" The body is defined as the cells currently occupied. The tail moves *simultaneously*. Usually in Snake, moving into the cell that the tail is vacating is safe. However, looking at the specific rule \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies\", the body is the set of cells excluding the head. The tail is part of the body. However, standard snake logic: if you move into the cell where the tail *currently is*, but the tail moves away in the same turn, it is safe. The prompt says: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" This is strict. But there is an exception: \"Your head is at (1,1) ... The body is [(1,0), (0,0)...] ... If your head moves into any snake's body... you die.\" In the previous turn, I considered moving UP into (1,1) where the tail was. The rationale said \"since I am not growing... the tail will move... freeing (1,1)\". So the prompt implies that simultaneous movement of the tail makes it safe. So, DOWN to (1,0) is safe because the tail (which is currently at (1,2) or (0,2) in the *next* turn context? No, the current body list is [(1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2)]. The tail is (1,2). The head is (1,1). If I go DOWN to (1,0), I hit the 2nd segment. The tail (1,2) leaves. The body shifts. The 2nd segment (1,0) moves to (0,0) (where the 3rd is). So (1,0) is vacated by the 2nd segment? No, the 2nd segment moves to the 3rd's spot. The 1st segment (head) moves to the 2nd's spot. So the cell (1,0) will be occupied by the head. The cell (1,0) is *currently* occupied by the 2nd segment. Since the head moves there, it's a collision. Actually, in standard snake rules, you die if you hit your body *except* the tail if it moves away. Here, (1,0) is the segment *next* to the head. That is a \"direct backwards\" move or hitting the body. It is definitely death.\n\n2.  **UP**: Target (1,2). The current body includes (1,2) as the tail. The tail will move (since I didn't eat). So (1,2) becomes free. **Safe**.\n\n3.  **LEFT**: Target (0,1). Current body includes (0,1). That's the 4th segment. It will shift to (0,2) (old tail). So (0,1) is occupied by the 3rd segment (0,0)? Wait. List: (1,1), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2). If I go LEFT to (0,1): The 2nd (1,0) goes to (0,0). The 3rd (0,0) goes to (0,1). The head wants to go to (0,1). Collision. So **DEAD**.\n\n4.  **RIGHT**: Target (2,1). This is empty (looking at board: row 1, col 2 is '.'). **Safe**.\n\nSo choices are UP and RIGHT.\nRIGHT moves me towards the bottom right corner.\nUP moves me towards the top. There is an apple at (3,9), (5,7), (7,5), (8,2), (8,4).\nCurrently at (1,1).\nApple (8,2) is at distance 7 (Manhattan). (7,5) is distance 9.\nEnemy snake #0 is at (4,6).\nI want to get out of the corner.\nLet's check immediate safety of neighbors for future planning.\nFrom (1,1), going UP to (1,2) (currently tail).\nNext turn from (1,2):\n- Left: (0,2) -> Currently occupied by (0,2). Tail leaves. Safe? Yes.\n- Right: (2,2) -> Empty. Safe.\n- Up: (1,3) -> Empty. Safe.\n- Down: (1,1) -> My head was there. Will be empty? Yes, I move out. Safe.\n\nFrom (2,1) (going RIGHT):\n- Left: (1,1) -> Empty. Safe.\n- Right: (3,1) -> Empty. Safe.\n- Up: (2,2) -> Empty. Safe.\n- Down: (2,0) -> Empty. Safe.\n\nBoth seem very open. However, UP puts me closer to the central apples. The path along the bottom (RIGHT) eventually hits the wall at (9,1). If I go RIGHT, I have to loop back. If I go UP, I have the whole board.\nAlso, the enemy snake #0 is at (4,6). I want to approach it from a safe angle.\n\nLet's consider the apples. The closest apple is (8,2) relative to (1,1)? No, (8,2) is far. The apples are (7,5), (5,7), (8,4), (3,9), (8,2).\nFrom (1,1):\n- (8,2): Dist 7\n- (5,7): Dist 9\n- (7,5): Dist 9\n- (3,9): Dist 10\n\nGoing UP increases Y, getting closer to all except maybe (8,2) (which is same Y difference).\nSo UP is slightly better for general progress.\n\nAlso, there is an apple at (8,2). If I go UP, I can eventually go Right and get it. If I go RIGHT, I go towards it.\nDistance to (8,2):\nFrom (1,1): 7.\nFrom (2,1): 6.\nFrom (1,2): 6.\nSo RIGHT is technically closer.\nHowever, (8,2) is very close to the bottom right corner (9,9 is top right, so (8,2) is bottom right area).\nGetting apples in corners is dangerous because you get trapped.\nApples in the center (5,7) or (7,5) are safer.\nThe apple at (8,4) is also there.\nI will prioritize the center/top apples.\n\nThe prompt asks for a strategy note for the next turn.\nI will move UP. The strategy will be to reach the top rows and then snake towards the center.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\n**START PLAN**\nMove UP to (1,2). From there, assess safety of moving further UP or RIGHT to get closer to apples at (5,7) or (7,5). Be careful of snake #0 at (4,6).\n**END PLAN**\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "The board currently shows my head at `(1, 1)` (marked as `1` in row 2, col 1). The body stretches down to `(1, 0)` and left into the bottom left corner. The enemy snake `#0` is at `(5, 6)`. Apples are scattered across the board, with the nearest ones being `(8, 2)` and `(8, 4)` in the bottom right, and `(5, 7)` and `(7, 5)` in the central upper area.\n\nI need to decide my next move:\n1.  **DOWN**: Target `(1, 0)`. My body currently occupies `(1, 0)`. Unless `(1, 0)` is the tail (which it isn't, the tail is further back at `(1, 2)` or similar based on the previous turn's logic), moving into a body segment results in death. Even if the tail moves, the segment at `(1, 0)` moves to `(0, 0)`, but the head moving there means the head occupies `(1, 0)` while the body segment moves away. Actually, wait. Let's look at the previous state. My head was at `(1, 1)`. The body list was `[(1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)]`. Wait, the prompt says \"Head: (1, 2)\" and \"Body: [(1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)]\". This implies the tail was at `(0, 2)`. However, the text description in the history says the tail was at `(1, 2)`. The board state shows `T` at `(1, 2)` (Row 2, Col 1) and `T` at `(0, 2)`. This is confusing.\n    Let's look at the board *current state*:\n    Row 2 (`y=2`): `T 1 . . . . . . A .` -> `T` at `(0,2)`, `1` at `(1,2)`. Wait, the prompt says \"Head: (1, 2)\". That contradicts the board \"Row 2\" which shows `T` at `(0,2)` and `1` at `(1,2)`? No, the prompt says \"Head: (1, 2)\". Let's look at the board text again:\n    `2 T 1 . . . . . . A .`\n    This row is `y=2`. `x=0` is `T`. `x=1` is `1`. So the head is at `(1, 2)`. The body is `[(1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)]`. The `T` at `(0, 2)` in the diagram is a mystery given the body list. The prompt says the snake has length 6 (Head + 5 body parts).\n    \n    Let's analyze moves from **Head (1, 2)**:\n    *   **DOWN to (1, 1)**: Current body includes `(1, 1)`. The tail is `(0, 2)`. Since I didn't eat, the tail leaves `(0, 2)`. However, `(1, 1)` is the *second* segment. The head moving to `(1, 1)` collides with the body segment that is currently there. That is a standard \"hitting yourself\" death.\n    *   **LEFT to (0, 2)**: Current body includes `(0, 2)` (and the diagram shows `T` there). It is safe to move into the tail's cell because the tail moves away. **Safe.**\n    *   **RIGHT to (2, 2)**: Empty. **Safe.**\n    *   **UP to (1, 3)**: Empty. **Safe.**\n\n    So I can move LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. I cannot move DOWN.\n\n    Where is the food?\n    *   `(8, 2)`: To the right.\n    *   `(5, 7)`, `(7, 5)`: Up and right.\n    *   `(8, 4)`: Up and right.\n    *   `(3, 9)`: Left and up.\n\n    Moving LEFT to `(0, 2)` puts me back into the corner or on the edge. This limits my future moves (I won't be able to go LEFT). The wall is to my left.\n    Moving UP to `(1, 3)` opens up the board.\n    Moving RIGHT to `(2, 2)` moves me towards the apples.\n\n    Moving RIGHT is the most aggressive towards the closest apples at `(8, 2)`. However, the enemy snake `#0` is at `(5, 6)`. `RIGHT` moves me away from it, which is generally safer if I want to avoid conflict, but I need food.\n    \n    Let's consider the \"trapped\" risk.\n    If I go LEFT, I am at `(0, 2)`. Next turn, I can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. UP is usually safer than DOWN into the corner.\n    If I go UP, I am at `(1, 3)`. I have many options.\n    If I go RIGHT, I am at `(2, 2)`. I have many options.\n\n    The apple at `(8, 2)` is very close to the bottom edge. If I go for it, I might get stuck in the bottom right corner. The apple at `(5, 7)` is better positioned.\n    \n    Let's look at the \"Turn: 21 / 150\". I have time.\n    The previous move was UP (from `1,1` to `1,2`). Staying on the left wall is not ideal. I should move into the open board.\n    \n    Between UP and RIGHT:\n    UP brings me closer to `(5, 7)` and `(7, 5)` without moving horizontally yet.\n    RIGHT brings me closer to `(8, 2)`.\n    \n    Let's check the Board for `(1, 3)`: Empty.\n    `(2, 2)`: Empty.\n\n    The prompt asks to \"keep future options open\".\n    Going LEFT restricts the left turn.\n    Going UP allows me to turn left, right, or up again.\n    Going RIGHT allows me to turn left, right, or up again.\n\n    Is there a reason to prefer RIGHT?\n    The apple at `(8, 2)` is in the same row as my current head `y=2`. If I go RIGHT now, I am making progress towards it. If I go UP, I have to come down later or zig-zag.\n    \n    However, the enemy is at `(5, 6)`. That is `x=5, y=6`. If I go UP to `(1, 3)`, I am moving away from the enemy. If I go RIGHT, I am moving towards the right side. The enemy is in the center. I am on the left.\n    \n    Let's check for \"Head-on collision\" risks.\n    Enemy snake #0 head is at `(5, 6)`. Body at `(4, 6), (4, 5)...`.\n    If I move UP, I'm at `(1, 3)`.\n    If I move RIGHT, I'm at `(2, 2)`.\n    Neither is close to `(5, 6)`.\n    \n    Let's look at the space around `(0, 2)` (LEFT).\n    If I go LEFT, I'm at `(0, 2)`. Next turn, I can go UP to `(0, 3)`. That's valid.\n    \n    The text says: \"Objective and strategy: ... favor moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available\".\n    LEFT: 3 options (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).\n    UP: 4 options (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).\n    RIGHT: 4 options (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN).\n    \n    So LEFT is slightly worse in terms of freedom.\n    \n    Between UP and RIGHT:\n    UP (1, 3) is closer to the center/apples `(5, 7)` and `(7, 5)`.\n    RIGHT (2, 2) is closer to `(8, 2)`.\n    \n    The apple at `(8, 2)` is dangerous because it's near the bottom edge. Getting trapped there is a high risk.\n    The apples at `(5, 7)` and `(7, 5)` are central.\n    \n    Also, there is an apple at `(3, 9)` (top left). Moving UP helps get there too.\n    \n    So, UP seems the best strategic move to access the board and avoid the corner trap.\n    \n    Wait, let's re-read the board carefully.\n    Row 2: `T 1 . . . . . . A .`\n    Row 1: `T T . . . . . . . .`\n    Row 0: `T T . . . . . . . .`\n    \n    The `T`s in row 1 and 0 are likely the body parts I shed or the rest of the snake.\n    My body is `[(1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)]`.\n    If I move UP to `(1, 3)`, the new body will be `[(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1)]`.\n    The tail `(0, 2)` is vacated.\n    This seems fine.\n    \n    Let's check the \"simultaneous move\" risk.\n    If I move UP, where could the enemy go?\n    Enemy is at `(5, 6)`. They might go for `(5, 7)` (which is an apple). `(5, 7)` is one step UP from `(5, 6)`.\n    If they go UP to `(5, 7)`, I am at `(1, 3)`. No collision.\n    If they go RIGHT to `(6, 6)`, no collision.\n    If they go LEFT to `(4, 6)`, no collision.\n    If they go DOWN to `(5, 5)`, no collision.\n    \n    There are no apples directly adjacent to my head `(1, 2)`. The closest is `(2, 2)` but there is no apple there (board shows `. `). So I am just moving to position.\n    \n    One more check on the board description.\n    `2 T 1 . . . . . . A .`\n    At `(0, 2)` is `T`. At `(1, 2)` is `1`.\n    The body list ends with `(0, 2)`. So `(0, 2)` is the tail.\n    Moving LEFT to `(0, 2)` is safe.\n    However, if I move UP or RIGHT, I am leaving the wall.\n    \n    Is there any benefit to moving LEFT?\n    Maybe to line up with `(3, 9)`? `(3, 9)` is `x=3`. If I go LEFT to `0`, I'm further away.\n    \n    So, LEFT is bad.\n    \n    RIGHT vs UP.\n    RIGHT (2, 2) -> closer to (8, 2).\n    UP (1, 3) -> closer to (5, 7), (7, 5).\n    Also (3, 9) is `x=3, y=9`. UP helps y.\n    \n    The snake is currently `Head: (1, 2)`.\n    Let's ensure we aren't moving into a trap.\n    `(2, 2)` is empty.\n    `(1, 3)` is empty.\n    \n    The prompt says: \"prefer moves that both: increase your chance of safely eating apples, and keep future options open\".\n    Moving UP keeps me away from the wall and opens up the top half of the board.\n    Moving RIGHT moves me towards a wall and a potentially dangerous area (bottom right corner).\n    \n    However, `(8, 2)` is an apple. If I don't go for it, the enemy might, or it might disappear.\n    But the enemy is at `(5, 6)`. To get to `(8, 2)`, they have to travel.\n    I am at `(1, 2)`. I can go RIGHT.\n    \n    Let's calculate \"safe follow-up moves\".\n    From `(1, 2)` (UP): `(1, 3)`.\n    From `(1, 3)`: can go `(0, 3)`, `(2, 3)`, `(1, 4)`, `(1, 2)`.\n    From `(2, 2)` (RIGHT): `(2, 3)`, `(2, 1)`, `(3, 2)`, `(1, 2)`.\n    \n    From `(2, 2)`, if I go `(2, 1)`, I am on `y=1`. `(2, 1)` is empty.\n    The bottom row is `y=0`. So `y=1` is safe from the bottom wall.\n    \n    Let's consider the snake #0.\n    Head (5, 6). Body [(4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4)].\n    If I go RIGHT to (2, 2), I am getting closer to (4, 4) and (4, 5).\n    If I go UP to (1, 3), I am staying away.\n    \n    Let's assume Snake #0 goes for the apple at (5, 7). That puts them at (5, 7).\n    I am at (1, 3) or (2, 2). Distance is large.\n    \n    Let's look at the apple at (8, 4).\n    If I go RIGHT, I get closer to (8, 4) as well.\n    \n    Is there a \"cycle\" or \"loop\" strategy?\n    If I stay on the left side (UP to 1,3), I can run up the left wall, eat (3, 9), then come down the right side.\n    If I go RIGHT, I enter the center/open early.\n    \n    Let's check if (2, 2) is safe for *next* turn.\n    If I move to (2, 2):\n    - (2, 3) is empty.\n    - (2, 1) is empty (row 1 col 2 is `.`).\n    - (3, 2) is empty (row 2 col 3 is `.`).\n    - (1, 2) is where my tail *was*. Safe.\n    \n    Let's check if (1, 3) is safe for *next* turn.\n    If I move to (1, 3):\n    - (1, 4) is empty.\n    - (1, 2) is where my tail *was*. Safe.\n    - (0, 3) is empty (row 3 col 0 is `.`).\n    - (2, 3) is empty.\n    \n    Both seem fine.\n    \n    Why might UP be better?\n    The board has an apple at (3, 9). To get there, I need to go UP.\n    The board has an apple at (5, 7). To get there, I need to go UP.\n    The board has an apple at (7, 5). To get there, I need to go UP and RIGHT.\n    The board has an apple at (8, 4). To get there, I need to go UP and RIGHT.\n    The board has an apple at (8, 2). To get there, I need to go RIGHT (and possibly DOWN later, but I am already low).\n    \n    Actually, I am at y=2. (8, 2) is y=2. So to get to (8, 2), I just need to go RIGHT. I don't need to go DOWN. I am on the same row.\n    So (8, 2) is a straight line right.\n    \n    However, getting that apple traps me at the right wall at (9, 2) or (8, 2). Then I have to turn. If I eat it, I grow. If I am at (8, 2) and the snake body is trailing behind, I might be stuck if I eat it near the wall.\n    \n    The apple at (5, 7) is much safer. It is in the middle.\n    \n    Also, look at the enemy body positions.\n    Body at (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4).\n    This is a vertical strip near x=4.\n    If I go RIGHT to (2, 2), I am approaching x=4.\n    If I go UP to (1, 3), I am approaching y=3-4.\n    The enemy is at y=6.\n    \n    The prompt says \"keep future options open\".\n    If I go RIGHT to (2, 2), my possible moves next turn are (2,3), (2,1), (3,2), (1,2).\n    (2,1) is towards the bottom wall (y=0).\n    (3,2) is towards the enemy (x=4).\n    (1,2) is back.\n    (2,3) is up.\n    \n    If I go UP to (1, 3):\n    (1,4), (0,3), (2,3), (1,2).\n    None of these immediately limit my space.\n    \n    There is no immediate threat.\n    I will choose UP to gain vertical space and keep my distance from the enemy and the walls.\n    The strategy note will be to prepare to move towards the central apples.\n\n    Wait, let's double check the board for Row 1: `T T . . . . . . . .`\n    Columns 0 and 1 are T. Column 2 is `.`.\n    If I go RIGHT to (2, 2), I am fine.\n    If I go UP to (1, 3), I am fine.\n    \n    Let's reconsider the apple at (8, 2).\n    It is at x=8, y=2.\n    If I go RIGHT, I get closer.\n    If I go UP, I get closer to (5, 7) and (7, 5).\n    (7, 5) is an apple.\n    (5, 7) is an apple.\n    (3, 9) is an apple.\n    (8, 4) is an apple.\n    \n    The cluster of apples is in the upper center/right.\n    Moving UP aligns me with the cluster.\n    Moving RIGHT aligns me with the bottom right outlier.\n    \n    So UP is better for the apple cluster.\n    Also, I am at y=2. (5, 7) is y=7. (7, 5) is y=5. (8, 4) is y=4. (3, 9) is y=9.\n    The lowest cluster apple is (8, 4) at y=4.\n    So moving UP is necessary to reach any of them except (8, 2).\n    \n    I will move UP. The strategy will be to move towards the top/left to get (3, 9) or loop to (5, 7).\n\n    Wait, I should check if there is any wall collision.\n    Head at (1, 2). Up is (1, 3). Board size 10x10 (0-9). (1, 3) is valid.\n    \n    What about the \"Last Move Information\"?\n    My last move was UP (from 1,1 to 1,2).\n    I am at (1, 2).\n    \n    If I move UP to (1, 3):\n    New Head: (1, 3).\n    New Body: (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1).\n    The tail (0, 2) disappears.\n    This is a valid snake state.\n    \n    Is there any risk of the enemy moving into my body?\n    My body will be:\n    (1, 2) (currently head, will be 2nd segment)\n    (1, 1) (currently 2nd, will be 3rd)\n    (1, 0) (currently 3rd, will be 4th)\n    (0, 0) (currently 4th, will be 5th)\n    (0, 1) (currently 5th, will be 6th (tail))\n    My head is at (1, 3).\n    \n    Enemy is at (5, 6).\n    They are far away.\n    \n    I will proceed with UP.\n\n    One detail: The board shows `T` at `(0, 2)`. My body list ends with `(0, 2)`. This matches.\n    The board shows `1` at `(1, 2)`. My head is `(1, 2)`. This matches.\n    The board shows `T` at `(1, 1)`? No, row 1 is `T T .`. So `(0, 1)` and `(1, 1)` are `T`.\n    My body list is `[(1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)]`.\n    `(1, 1)` -> T (row 1, col 1). Correct.\n    `(1, 0)` -> T (row 0, col 1). Correct.\n    `(0, 0)` -> T (row 0, col 0). Correct.\n    `(0, 1)` -> T (row 1, col 0). Correct.\n    `(0, 2)` -> T (row 2, col 0). Correct.\n    \n    Wait, looking at the prompt's board:\n    `2 T 1 . . . . . . A .`\n    `1 T T . . . . . . . .`\n    `0 T T . . . . . . . .`\n    \n    My body at (0, 2) is `T`.\n    My body at (0, 1) is `T`.\n    My body at (0, 0) is `T`.\n    My body at (1, 0) is `T`.\n    My body at (1, 1) is `T`.\n    My head at (1, 2) is `1`.\n    \n    This matches the list `[(1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)]` perfectly (if we assume the list is `Head, 2nd, 3rd...`).\n    Wait, the prompt says: \"Body: [(1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)]\". And Head: (1, 2).\n    So the full snake is:\n    1. (1, 2) Head\n    2. (1, 1) Body\n    3. (1, 0) Body\n    4. (0, 0) Body\n    5. (0, 1) Body\n    6. (0, 2) Body (Tail)\n    \n    The board shows `T`s at all these positions.\n    Good.\n    \n    Move UP to (1, 3).\n    Next turn, the snake will be:\n    1. (1, 3) Head\n    2. (1, 2) Body (was head)\n    3. (1, 1) Body (was 2nd)\n    4. (1, 0) Body (was 3rd)\n    5. (0, 0) Body (was 4th)\n    6. (0, 1) Body (was 5th/Tail) -> The tail (0, 2) moves to (0, 1)? No.\n    The tail moves OFF the board. The new tail is the 5th segment of the previous configuration.\n    Previous configuration: `Head(1,2), 2(1,1), 3(1,0), 4(0,0), 5(0,1), 6(0,2)`.\n    If I move UP:\n    Head -> (1, 3)\n    2 -> (1, 2)\n    3 -> (1, 1)\n    4 -> (1, 0)\n    5 -> (0, 0)\n    6 -> (0, 1)\n    So the tail becomes (0, 1).\n    The cell (0, 2) becomes empty.\n    \n    Is (0, 1) a valid tail position? Yes.\n    \n    So UP is definitely safe and valid.\n\n    What about RIGHT?\n    Move RIGHT to (2, 2).\n    Head -> (2, 2)\n    2 -> (1, 2)\n    3 -> (1, 1)\n    4 -> (1, 0)\n    5 -> (0, 0)\n    6 -> (0, 1) (Wait, 5 was (0, 1)? No, 5 was (0, 1) in the list? Let's check the list again.\n    Body: [(1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)]\n    So:\n    2: (1, 1)\n    3: (1, 0)\n    4: (0, 0)\n    5: (0, 1)\n    6: (0, 2) (Tail)\n    \n    If I move RIGHT:\n    Head -> (2, 2)\n    2 -> (1, 2)\n    3 -> (1, 1)\n    4 -> (1, 0)\n    5 -> (0, 0)\n    6 -> (0, 1)\n    Tail at (0, 1).\n    \n    Both UP and RIGHT result in the same body configuration, just head at different X/Y.\n    \n    So the decision is purely based on direction of travel.\n    \n    I will stick with UP. It's better to centralize and go for the main apple cluster.\n    \n    One final check on the apple at (8, 2).\n    If I go UP, I increase Y distance to (8, 2).\n    But (8, 2) is dangerous.\n    I have 5 apples. Enemy has 4.\n    I should play safe to win the turn count or reach 50.\n    Getting the risky apple (8, 2) might cause death.\n    Getting the safe apples (center) is better.\n    \n    I will move UP.\n\n    Plan: Move UP to (1, 3). From there, evaluate path to (5, 7) or (3, 9). Avoid enemy at (4, 6).\n\n    Final move: UP.Based on the current board state, my head is at `(1, 2)`. The immediate neighbors are:\n- **DOWN to (1, 1)**: Occupied by my own body (the segment directly behind the head). This is a fatal collision.\n- **LEFT to (0, 2)**: Occupied by the tail. Since I did not eat an apple last turn, the tail will move, making this a safe move.\n- **RIGHT to (2, 2)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **UP to (1, 3)**: Empty. Safe.\n\nMoving **LEFT** to `(0, 2)` keeps me pinned against the wall and moves me away from the central apple cluster `(5, 7)`, `(7, 5)`, and `(8, 4)`. It restricts my future options.\n\nMoving **RIGHT** towards `(8, 2)` is a direct path to an apple, but `(8, 2)` is very close to the bottom-right corner. Getting an apple there risks getting trapped against the wall in subsequent turns.\n\nMoving **UP** opens up the board, moves me towards the safer, clustered apples in the upper central region (closer to `(5, 7)` and `(3, 9)`), and keeps my options open. It maintains a safe distance from the enemy snake at `(5, 6)`.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\nMove UP to `(1, 3)`. From there, check the safety of moving towards the center `(5, 7)` while maintaining distance from Snake #0.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "My head is at `(1, 4)`. My tail is currently at `(0, 0)`.\n\nI must eliminate immediately fatal moves:\n- **DOWN**: Moves to `(1, 3)`. Looking at my body list, the segment at `(1, 3)` exists. Since I move simultaneously with my tail, and my tail is currently at `(0, 0)` (not `(1, 3)`), the cell `(1, 3)` is definitely occupied by my body. Moving **DOWN** is fatal.\n- **LEFT**: Moves to `(0, 4)`. This is within the board (x=0) and is currently empty (based on the board state, my body is at y=0 and y=1). This is safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to `(2, 4)`. Currently empty. Safe.\n- **UP**: Moves to `(1, 5)`. Currently empty. Safe.\n\nNow I evaluate the safe moves to maximize future options and score:\n- **LEFT to (0, 4)**: This moves me to the left wall. It opens up `(0, 5)` and `(0, 3)`. However, sticking to walls limits mobility and puts me near the corner.\n- **RIGHT to (2, 4)**: This moves me centrally. It connects me to the apple at `(3, 9)` (via `x=2,3` rows) and opens up a path to the cluster in the upper center `(7, 5)`, `(8, 4)`. It also keeps me away from the wall.\n- **UP to (1, 5)**: This also moves me centrally and towards the upper cluster. It is effectively the same vector as RIGHT, just vertical instead of horizontal.\n\nComparing **RIGHT** and **UP**:\nThe apples in the upper center (row 5, 7, 9) are more valuable and numerous than the single apple at `(8, 2)`.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to `(2, 4)` positions me on column 2, which is the gateway to the central board (`x=3` to `x=8`). I can immediately reach apples at `(3, 9)` and `(3, 5)` (if `3,5` had an apple, actually apples are at `3,9`, `7,5`, `8,4`).\n- My current body occupies `x=1` for `y=0` to `y=3`. Moving to `x=2` gives me access to `x=3` without obstruction. Moving `UP` to `(1, 5)` would require passing through `y=4` (occupied by me now), `y=3` (occupied), `y=2`, `y=1`. But since I am moving, the tail leaves `(1, 0)`. So `UP` is also a valid path.\n\nHowever, **RIGHT** to `(2, 4)` is the best move to escape the tight \"column 1\" strip I am currently in. It aligns me with the open rows of the board to pursue the apples at `(3, 9)`, `(7, 5)`, and `(8, 4)`. The apple at `(8, 2)` is reachable eventually via `x=2` -> `x=3` -> `x=8`, but the upper apples are closer in terms of Manhattan distance if I start moving horizontally now.\n\nMy last move was **UP**, taking me from `(1, 2)` to `(1, 3)`. I updated my planned move logic in the scratchpad and confirmed that `RIGHT` is the superior escape vector from my current vertical confinement.\n\nPlan for next turn: Move to `(2, 4)`. In the following turns, turn up towards `(2, 9)` to pick up the apple at `(3, 9)` or move right towards `(7, 5)`.\n\nRIGHT",

The segment `(1, 4)` connects to `(2, 4)`. `(1, 3)` is next.\n    - If I move **DOWN** to `(2, 3)`, is that safe?\n    - My current body occupies `(1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2)...`.\n    - The cell `(2, 3)` is currently empty (board shows `.` at `(2, 3)`).\n    - However, I must check if `UP` is blocked by the enemy.\n    - Enemy snake #0 is at `(7, 7)` with body `[(6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5)]`.\n    - The apple at `(7, 5)` is directly below the enemy's column.\n\n**Target Apples:**\n- `(3, 9)`: Top right area.\n- `(8, 4)`: Bottom right area.\n- `(7, 5)`: Just below the enemy.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy snake #0 has its head at `(7, 7)`. The space immediately to its right is `(8, 7)` (empty). Up is `(7, 8)` (empty). Left is `(6, 7)` (occupied by its body). Down is `(7, 6)` (occupied by its body, as its tail is `(4, 5)` and it goes up to `(5, 6)`, `(5, 7)`, etc.? Wait, the body list is `[(6, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5)]`. This implies the tail is at `(4, 5)`.\nThe cells:\n- `(7, 7)`: Head\n- `(6, 7)`: Segment 1\n- `(5, 7)`: Segment 2\n- `(5, 6)`: Segment 3\n- `(4, 6)`: Segment 4\n- `(4, 5)`: Tail\n\nSo the enemy occupies `x=7` at `y=7` (head) and `x=6` at `y=7` (body). `x=7` at `y=6` is empty (gap between head and body? No, the body list goes from head to tail. `(6, 7)` is connected to `(7, 7)`. `(5, 7)` is connected to `(6, 7)`. So the body chain is: (7,7) -> (6,7) -> (5,7) -> (5,6) -> (4,6) -> (4,5).\nSo `(7, 6)` is empty.\n\n**Apple at (7, 5):**\nMy head is at `(2, 4)`.\nDistance to `(7, 5)`: `|7-2| + |5-4| = 5 + 1 = 6`.\nDistance for Enemy to `(7, 5)`: `|7-7| + |5-7| = 0 + 2 = 2`.\nThe enemy is much closer to `(7, 5)`. Furthermore, the enemy is *blocking* the path to `(8, 4)` and `(8, 2)` if it stays in that column.\nHowever, the enemy might move to eat `(7, 5)` next.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN twice, it can reach `(7, 5)`. `DOWN` from `(7, 7)` to `(7, 6)` -> `DOWN` to `(7, 5)`.\n\nMy goal should be to secure the top-left apple `(3, 9)` or find a safe path around the enemy. Since I am at `(2, 4)`, I am quite far from the enemy. The enemy is at `(7, 7)`. I am at `(2, 4)`. We are on opposite sides of the board vertically? No, y=4 vs y=7. X=2 vs X=7.\n\nLet's look at my immediate moves:\n- **UP (2, 5)**: Safe. Moves towards `(3, 9)`.\n- **DOWN (2, 3)**: Safe.\n- **RIGHT (3, 4)**: Safe.\n- **LEFT (1, 4)**: **FATAL**. My body occupies `(1, 4)` (connects to `(2, 4)`). Moving back there is suicide.\n\nSo Left is out.\n\n**Strategic Plan:**\nI have 5 apples. Enemy has 5 apples. It is a tie. The score limit is 50 (or game end if all die). Turn 24/150.\nI should prioritize safety and then apples.\nThe apple at `(3, 9)` is \"mine\" (far from enemy). The apples at `(8, 4)` and `(8, 2)` are contested.\nLet's move towards `(3, 9)`.\nFrom `(2, 4)`, moving **UP** puts me at `(2, 5)`. Then I can go `(2, 6)`, `(2, 7)`, `(2, 8)`, `(2, 9)`, `(3, 9)`. This is a clear path.\n\nWhat about the enemy?\nIf the enemy moves **DOWN** to `(7, 6)`, it gets closer to `(7, 5)`.\nIf it moves **DOWN** again next turn, it will be at `(7, 5)`.\nI cannot intercept that.\nI should just focus on my own path.\n\n**Check Moves:**\n- **UP**: (2, 5). Path opens up to (2, 6), (3, 5), etc.\n- **RIGHT**: (3, 4). This moves towards the center. The apple at (3, 9) is up. (3, 4) -> (3, 5) -> ... -> (3, 9) is a straight line. However, the board at (3, 5) is `.` (empty). At (3, 6) is `.`. At (3, 7) is `.`. At (3, 8) is `.`. At (3, 9) is `A`.\n- **DOWN**: (2, 3). Leads to (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0). No apples there (closest is (1, 7) and (8, 2)). Down seems like a dead end towards the bottom wall.\n\n**Comparison of UP vs RIGHT:**\n- **UP to (2, 5)**:\n  - Moves closer to the wall, but not stuck. Can go Right or Left later.\n  - Good approach to (3, 9).\n  - Keeps distance from enemy.\n- **RIGHT to (3, 4)**:\n  - Moves to the central column `x=3`. This is very open.\n  - I can reach (3, 9) from here easily.\n  - I can also reach (8, 2) or (8, 4) eventually by going down then right (if the enemy clears out).\n\nLet's look at the board state again for `x=3`.\n`x=3` row:\n- `y=9`: A (Apple)\n- `y=8`: .\n- `y=7`: . (Wait, board shows `y=7` has `A` at (1,7) and `0` at (7,7). `y=7` row: `. A . . . T T 0 . .`. `x=3` at `y=7` is `.`).\n- `y=6`: .\n- `y=5`: . (Row 5: `. . . . T . . A . .`. `x=3` is `.`).\n- `y=4`: . (Row 4: `. T 1 . . . . . A .`. `x=3` is `.`).\n- `y=3`: . (Row 3: `. T . . . . . . . .`. `x=3` is `.`).\n- `y=2`: . (Row 2: `. T . . . . . . A .`. `x=3` is `.`).\n- `y=1`: .\n- `y=0`: .\n\nSo column `x=3` is entirely empty except for the apple at `(3, 9)`. It is a perfect \"highway\" to the apple.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **RIGHT** to `(3, 4)` utilizes this empty column to rush the apple at `(3, 9)`. It is also a central position that keeps options open.\nMoving **UP** to `(2, 5)` is good, but `(2, 5)` is adjacent to my old body at `(1, 4)` and `(1, 5)` (empty currently). `x=2` is not as empty as `x=3`.\nSpecifically, `x=2` has `.` at `y=9` down to `y=2`, but `x=3` is completely empty. `RIGHT` is the best move to maximize mobility.\n\nWait, I must ensure `(3, 4)` is not occupied.\nBoard row 4: `. T 1 . . . . . A .`\nIndices: 0: ., 1: T, 2: 1, 3: ., 4: ., ...\nSo `(3, 4)` is `.`. It is safe.\n\nOne final check: Enemy at `(7, 7)`. Could it move left?\nIf it moves Left to `(6, 7)`, it hits its own body (next segment is `(6, 7)`). So it cannot go Left.\nIf it moves Down to `(7, 6)`, it is safe.\nIf it moves Up to `(7, 8)`, it is safe.\nIf it moves Right to `(8, 7)`, it is safe.\nIt has 3 safe moves.\nI don't need to worry about immediate collision with it. We are far apart.\n\nMy move: **RIGHT**.\n\nPlan for next turn: Move along the `x=3` column towards `(3, 9)`.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving here is fatal.\n    *   **DOWN:** `(2, 3)` is currently empty (board shows `.`). However, looking at the long-term path, moving down towards the bottom of the board reduces available space and moves away from the closest apples.\n    *   **UP:** `(2, 5)` is currently empty. This is a safe move but leads to a column (`x=2`) that is decent but not as open as the alternative.\n    *   **RIGHT:** `(3, 4)` is currently empty (board shows `.`). It is safe.\n\n2.  **Strategic Value:**\n    *   **The Apple at (3, 9):** This is the apple furthest away from the enemy snake (who is at `(7, 7)`).

My head moves here *into* my body.\n    *   **Fatal.**\n\n3.  **LEFT (3, 6):**\n    *   Looking at the board grid: Row 6, Column 3 is currently empty.\n    *   It is within bounds (x=3 >= 0).\n    *   It is not part of my body.\n    *   It is not part of the enemy snake's body (enemy heads at (8,4) and (8,5) specifically).\n    *   **Safe.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 6):**\n    *   Looking at the board grid: Row 6, Column 5 is currently empty.\n    *   It is within bounds (x=5 <= 9).\n    *   It is not part of my body.\n    *   It is not part of the enemy snake's body. (Wait, checking enemy body: (5,6) is the second to last segment of the enemy snake (Snake #0). The list is (8,4), (8,5), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,6). So yes, (5,6) is occupied by the enemy tail).\n    *   **Fatal.**\n\nSo, the safe moves are **UP** and **LEFT**.\n\nNow, I analyze the strategic value of the safe moves:\n\n*   **Target Apples:** The closest apples are at (4, 8) (2 steps North) and (3, 9) (3 steps North/West).\n*   **Long-term Plan:**\n    *   Moving **UP** to (4, 7) positions me perfectly to eat the apple at (4, 8) next turn.\n    *   Moving **LEFT** to (3, 6) allows me to approach the cluster of apples at (4, 8) and (3, 9), but doesn't give an immediate line to one specific apple. However, (3, 9) is in the top left, and (3, 6) is on the column for that.\n    *   I must also consider the enemy snake (Snake #0). It is at (8, 4). It has been moving somewhat randomly but seems to favor the right side. It has 7 apples, I have 5. I need to eat efficiently.\n\n*   **Risk Assessment:**\n    *   If I go **UP** to (4, 7): I am clear to go to (4, 8) next. However, I need to ensure I don't get trapped. My tail is currently at (1, 4). If I continue moving up, my tail will eventually move to (1, 3), (1, 2), etc. This seems safe.\n    *   If I go **LEFT** to (3, 6): I am one step closer to (3, 9). This is also a valid path.\n\nComparing the two:\nBoth UP and LEFT are safe.\nUP moves me onto the vertical axis of the apple at (4, 8). The grid shows (4, 7) is empty.\nLEFT moves me towards the apple at (3, 9). The grid shows (3, 6) is empty.\n\nI prefer moving UP because it sets up a direct path to the apple at (4, 8). The board at (4, 7) is empty, and (4, 8) is an apple. I can eat that next turn.\nIf I go LEFT, I have to choose between (4, 8) (which would require a right turn) or (3, 9) (requiring further movement up). The UP move is more direct for the nearest apple (which is (4, 8) relative to my current position of (4,6)).\n\nWait, let's double check the grid for (4, 7) and (4, 8).\nRow 7: `. A . . . T T T . .`\nColumn 4 is the 5th character (index 4).\nRow 7: indices: 0:'.', 1:'A', 2:'.', 3:'.', 4:'.' (Wait, let's look at the prompt again).\n\nGrid:\n9 . . . A . . . . . .  (A at x=3, y=9)\n8 . . . . A . . . . .  (A at x=4, y=8)\n7 . A . . . T T T . .  (A at x=1, y=7, T at x=5,6,7, y=7)\n6 . . . . 1 T . T . .  (My head 1 at x=4, y=6, T at x=5,7, y=6)\n5 . . . . T . . T T .  (T at x=4, y=5, T at x=7,8, y=5)\n4 . T T T T . . . 0 .  (T at x=1,2,3,4, y=4, 0 at x=8, y=4)\n\nLet's map my head (4, 6).\n*   UP (4, 7): Look at row 7. The character at index 4 is '.'. Safe.\n*   LEFT (3, 6): Look at row 6. The character at index 3 is '.'. Safe.\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 7), I am setting up for (4, 8) which is an apple. This is a good move.\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 6), I can potentially go for (3, 9) which is also an apple. But (4, 8) is closer (2 steps vs 3 steps).\n\nI will stick with UP to target the apple at (4, 8) efficiently.\n\nOne final check on safety.\nEnemy snake (0) is at (8,4).\nIf enemy moves UP (8,5) -> (8,6). I am at (4,6). Distance is large.\nIf enemy moves LEFT (7,4) -> (7,5).\nIf enemy moves DOWN (8,3). Safe.\nIf enemy moves RIGHT (9,4). Safe.\n\nMy own body:\nHead (4, 6).\nBody (4, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4).\nMoving UP to (4, 7) avoids my body.\n\nI am confident in UP.\n\nPlan for next turn:\nMove UP to (4, 7). Next turn, move UP to (4, 8) to eat the apple. After eating, my tail will not move that turn (I will grow). The turn after, I will have to decide if I want to go for (4, 9) (if safe) or turn towards (3, 9) or (3, 8) or something else. But first, get the apple at (4, 8).\n\nDouble check turn 28 / 150. Plenty of time.\n\nUP",

Next turn avoid moving UP into neck. Consider moving DOWN to (8, 1) or LEFT/RIGHT to stay safe. Enemy may be at (4, 8) or (3, 7). Keep expanding apple lead while avoiding future collisions.\n\nDOWN",

A . . . . . . `.\n    - The cell (4, 9) is empty (indicated by the dot at the 4th position in the row string).\n    - It is within bounds.\n    - It is not occupied by my body.\n    - There are no enemy snakes near row 9 (enemy is at Y=2).\n    - **Status:** SAFE.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, 7):**\n    - My body segment is at (4, 7).\n    - **Status:** UNSAFE (Self Collision).\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 8):**\n    - The board state for row 8 at x=3 is empty (dot).\n    - It is within bounds.\n    - It is not occupied by my body.\n    - **Status:** SAFE.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 8):**\n    - The board state for row 8 at x=5 is 'A' (Apple).\n    - It is within bounds.\n    - It is not occupied by my body.\n    - **Status:** SAFE (and contains an apple).\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n- I am currently at (4, 8).\n- There is an apple at (5, 8), which is directly to my right. This is the most efficient move to score a point immediately.\n- Moving UP to (4, 9) is safe, but leads to the top edge of the board, which might limit future mobility.\n- Moving LEFT to (3, 8) is safe but moves me away from the apple at (5, 8).\n- Moving DOWN is fatal.\n\nBetween the safe options (UP, LEFT, RIGHT), moving RIGHT to (5, 8) offers an immediate point and maintains a central position relative to the board's width.\n\n**Comparison with Last Turn Logic:**\nMy last move was UP (from (4, 7) to (4, 8)). The rationale stated that I was at (4, 6) and moved UP to (4, 7), but the \"My snake\" data shows Head: (4, 8). The provided Last Rationale seems to describe a state from 2 turns ago. I will act on the current actual state.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 8) allows me to eat an apple and grow. It is a safe move that is consistent with the objective of maximizing apples.\n\nRIGHT",

So (7, 0) will still be there if I delay.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nSafest is LEFT to (6, 1), keeping high mobility and option to get apple next turn from a safer position. Eating apple now at (7, 0) leaves me in a corner with only 2 exits, which is risky long-term.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 1), consider DOWN to (6, 0) then LEFT/UP to approach (7, 0) or (4, 3). Keep enemy in mind\u2014they may go for (8, 6) or (3, 9). Maintain mobility advantage.  \n\nLEFT",

Wait, I have 8, enemy will have 8 after this turn). So tie in apples if I don\u2019t eat.  \n\nApple (7, 0) is very close. If I go DOWN to (6, 0), next turn I can go RIGHT to (7, 0) and eat it. But that leaves me at (7, 0) with only LEFT safe next (since UP is neck, DOWN off board, RIGHT off board or body). That\u2019s a potential trap.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 1), I keep 3 safe moves and can still approach (7, 0) later via (5, 0) \u2192 (6, 0) \u2192 (7, 0) in 3 turns, but enemy is far away and can\u2019t reach (7, 0) before me if I commit.  \n\nBut enemy will be at (3, 9) after this turn, far from (7, 0).  \n\nBest is to eat (7, 0) soon to keep lead. Going DOWN now to (6, 0) sets up eating it next turn. Risk: after eating at (7, 0), I\u2019ll have only LEFT (to (6, 0)) safe, which is okay if I plan ahead.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nI\u2019ll go DOWN to (6, 0) to get in position to eat (7, 0) next turn and extend lead to 9 apples vs enemy\u2019s 8.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 0), go RIGHT to (7, 0) to eat apple. Then from (7, 0) only LEFT to (6, 0) is safe, so I must ensure (6, 0) is clear next turn\u2014it will be because my tail will move from (7, 6) to (7, 5) after I eat, so (6, 0) will be empty. Then from (6, 0) I\u2019ll have more options again.  \n\nDOWN",

No, board width 0\u20139, so (8, 0) is on board. Is (8, 0) occupied? My body: (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5) are above, not (8, 0). Enemy body not near. So RIGHT (8, 0) is empty and safe!  \nThus from (7, 0) after eating, only RIGHT is safe.  \n\nIf LEFT to (5, 0):  \nBody: head (5, 0), then (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5) length 9.  \nFrom (5, 0) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 1) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 0) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 0) \u2192 neck \u2192 death.  \nSafe moves: UP, LEFT.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Strategic choice**  \nRIGHT (7, 0) gets apple and extends lead, but leaves only one safe move next turn (RIGHT to (8, 0)). That\u2019s risky but not immediately fatal if (8, 0) is safe next turn.  \nLEFT (5, 0) keeps more options open but delays eating.  \n\nGiven enemy is far away and can\u2019t reach (7, 0) before me, I should eat it now.

It is currently occupied by my body segment (the one connecting the head to the neck). Moving here is moving into my own body. **DEAD.**\n    *   **LEFT (1, 9):** On the board. Looking at the map row 9: `. . . 1 T T . . . .` (Wait, looking at the provided map, row 9 is `9 . . 1 T T T . . . .`). Let's look at the provided board state text:\n        `9 . . 1 T T T . . . .`\n        `(2,9)` is the third dot (index 2).\n        `(1,9)` is the second dot (index 1).\n        `(0,9)` is the first dot (index 0).\n        There is no snake or apple listed in those cells. **SAFE.**\n    *   **DOWN (2, 8):** On the board. Row 8: `8 . . . . T T . . . .`\n        `(2,8)` is the third dot (index 2).\n        `(3,8)` is the fourth dot (index 3).\n        Empty. **SAFE.**\n\n3.  **Strategic Choice:**\n    *   Target is the apple at **(1, 7)**.\n    *   **LEFT to (1, 9):** Distance to (1,7) is |1-1| + |9-7| = 0 + 2 = 2 steps.\n    *   **DOWN to (2, 8):** Distance to (1,7) is |2-1| + |8-7| = 1 + 1 = 2 steps.\n    *   Both moves result in the same Manhattan distance to the target.\n    *   However, moving **LEFT to (1, 9)** puts me directly above the apple at (1,7). The path (1,9) -> (1,8) -> (1,7) is completely empty on the map (Row 7 has A at (1,7), Row 8 has dots at (1,8)). This is a straight, clear shot.\n    *   Moving DOWN to (2,8) would require a diagonal path or more turns to loop to (1,7).\n    *   Additionally, moving LEFT keeps me tucked in the corner where I am less likely to encounter the enemy snake (who is at Y=0).\n    *   I must ensure I don't trap myself in the corner. If I go to (1,9), I am at the edge. Next turn I can go DOWN to (1,8) or LEFT to (0,9). Both are likely safe. The plan is to go DOWN next to eat the apple.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Move LEFT to (1,9) to get the perfect angle on the apple at (1,7).\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to (1,9) to align directly with the apple at (1,7). Next turn I will move DOWN to (1,8), then DOWN to (1,7) to eat the apple.\n\nLEFT",

Low immediate threat.\n\n3.  **Apples:**\n    *   (1, 7) is the closest target.\n    *   Other apples are far or blocked.\n\n4.  **Move Options from (1, 9):**\n    *   **UP:** (1, 10) is outside the board (0-9 range). **DEAD.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (2, 9). Looking at the board state text: `9 . . 1 T T T . . . .` (Indices 0-9). The snake head is at index 2. Moving RIGHT puts the head at index 3. The map shows a 'T' (Snake Body) at indices 3, 4, and 5. This is my own body. Moving here causes a collision. **DEAD.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (0, 9). The map shows index 0 is `.` (Empty). **SAFE.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (1, 8). The map shows index 1 in row 8 is `.` (Empty). **SAFE.**\n\n5.  **Strategy:**\n    *   I have two safe moves: LEFT and DOWN.\n    *   Target is (1, 7).\n    *   **LEFT (to 0,9):** Distance to (1,7) is |0-1| + |9-7| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n    *   **DOWN (to 1,8):** Distance to (1,7) is |1-1| + |8-7| = 0 + 1 = 1.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** is the most direct path to the apple. It decreases distance to the target.\n    *   Moving **LEFT** goes to a corner. While potentially safe, it creates a path to the apple that requires 2 subsequent moves: LEFT->DOWN->DOWN (or DOWN->LEFT->DOWN), whereas DOWN->DOWN is straight. Straight paths are safer and predictable.\n    *   The enemy is far away, so no immediate need to flee to a corner.\n    *   Therefore, **DOWN** is the optimal move to secure the apple at (1,7) as quickly as possible.\n\nPlan:\nMove DOWN to (1,8). This is the shortest path to the apple at (1,7). The cell (1,7) is occupied by an apple, and the map shows no obstacles between (1,8) and (1,7). Eating the apple will grow the snake, which I need to account for in future turns, but for now, getting the point is the priority.\n\nDOWN",

That\u2019s a dead-end path (top-right corner trap).  \n\nFrom (9, 0) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (9, 1) \u2192 my body (first segment next turn) \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 0) \u2192 my body (third segment) \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 death.  \nSo no safe moves next turn if I go DOWN now \u2192 death next turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Re-evaluate: is DOWN truly safe?**  \nIf I go DOWN to (9, 0), next turn I have zero safe moves \u2192 guaranteed death. So DOWN is unsafe in the sense of survival beyond this turn. The rules say \u201cnever choose a move that obviously kills you\u201d \u2014 this includes moves that force death next turn. So DOWN should be eliminated.  \n\nThus only UP is viable.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Apple targeting and long-term plan**  \nApple (8, 6) is above. From (9, 2) only UP is possible next turn \u2192 (9, 3). Then from (9, 3): UP to (9, 4) maybe, but eventually need to go LEFT toward (8, 6). However, my body blocks left at lower rows.  \nI need to plan an escape from the top-right corner. Possibly after (9, 3), if I go UP again to (9, 4), then maybe LEFT to (8, 4) if clear. But my tail is at (8, 3) now, will move as I advance.  \nEnemy will likely eat (1, 6) or (0, 8) soon, tying apples at 10 each.  \nPriority: survive, avoid corner trap.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Check if any alternative exists**  \nCould I go UP and then next turn UP again to (9, 3), then maybe LEFT to (8, 3)? At turn 40, (8, 3) will be my current tail \u2014 by then it may have moved if I eat an apple. But I\u2019m not eating soon. Actually, my tail moves only when I eat an apple. Since I won\u2019t eat next turn, tail stays at (8, 3) at turn 39, so at turn 40 (if I go UP twice), (8, 3) will still be occupied. So path left from (9, 3) is blocked.  \nThis means going UP now leads to a trap in 2\u20133 turns unless enemy dies or I eat an apple soon.  \n\nBut DOWN leads to immediate death next turn. So UP is the only move that gives at least one more turn alive. Maybe enemy dies before I\u2019m trapped.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nI must pick UP to survive this turn and have a chance next turn. Next turn from (9, 2) only UP is safe, so I\u2019ll go to (9, 3). Then hope enemy dies or I find a way out via apple growth or tail movement.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9, 2), only UP safe. Take it. Then from (9, 3), re-evaluate: if tail has moved (if I ate apple), maybe LEFT opens; otherwise, maybe UP again to (9, 4) and hope left opens later. Try to steer toward apple (8, 6) if possible, but survival first.\n\nUP",

My body follows behind at (0, 7), (1, 7), etc. I need to maneuver towards the central apples at (3, 5), (4, 3), and (5, 2). I will move towards the center, prioritizing maintaining open space.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\n**START RATIONALE**\n1.  **Current State Update:** According to the \"Last Move\" section, I successfully moved UP to (0, 8). This means I have now eaten the apple at (0, 8). My new head position is (0, 8). The cell (0, 7) is now the start of my body.\n2.  **Move Evaluation (from Head at 0, 8):**\n    *   **UP:** Target (0, 9). The board state at (0, 9) shows 'T' (my tail, part of the wall I built). My head just moved away from there, but since I didn't grow (I moved, but checking the apple list... wait, (0, 8) was an apple). I definitely ate at (0, 8). So (0, 9) is currently occupied by the segment that was at (0, 8) before I moved? No. My body segments moved up. Let's trace: Old head (0, 7) -> New head (0, 8). Old segment (1, 7) -> (0, 7). Old segment (1, 8) -> (1, 7). The tail shifts. The cell (0, 9) was part of my body in the previous state (at turn 39). It was `(1, 9)`, `(0, 9)`, `(0, 8)`. I moved from (0, 7) to (0, 8). So (0, 9) was my body. Since I ate, my tail does not move forward (wait, the rules say: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\". This usually means the tail stays, extending the body. The provided turn 39 state lists my tail at `(4, 8)`. Let's look at the provided board: At (0, 9), the board shows 'T'. This is my tail. In the previous turn, I moved from (0, 7) to (0, 8) (eating). The tail at (4, 8) stays put because I grew. The rest of the body moves. The segment at (0, 8) (which was actually a 'T' in the old board? No, the old board at (0, 8) was '1'. The old board at (0, 9) was 'T'. So my body at turn 39 was (0, 8) head, (0, 7) body, ..., (0, 9) body. Wait, the \"Your Snake\" definition at the start of the prompt is the state *before* the \"Last Move\". The \"Last Move\" was UP to (0, 7). No, the prompt says: \"Turn: 40 / 150\". It provides the state at the *start* of Turn 40. The \"Last Move\" section describes what happened on Turn 39. \"Your last move information... UP\". So on Turn 39, I was at (0, 7) and moved UP to (0, 8). The state shown is the *result* of that move (Turn 40). So:\n    *   Head is at (0, 8).\n    *   Body is [(0, 7), ...].\n    *   Apples eaten includes (0, 8).\n    *   Now I need to make the move for Turn 40.\n3.  **Safety Check (Head at 0, 8):**\n    *   **UP:** Target (0, 9). The board state shows 'T' (Tail) at (0, 9). Since I just ate, my tail *did not* move from the previous position. Wait, let's re-read the growth rules. \"If you move onto an apple... you grow by 1 segment\". In standard Snake, this means the tail does *not* move this turn, effectively adding a segment. My old body (excluding the tail) moves. My old tail stays. So what is at (0, 9)? In the *current* board state (provided), (0, 9) is 'T'. This means it is occupied by my body. If I move UP, I hit my own body. **DEATH**.\n    *   **LEFT:** (-1, 8). Off board. **DEATH**.\n    *   **RIGHT:** (1, 8). The board shows '.' (Empty) at (1, 8). Is it safe? My body starts at (0, 7) and goes to (1, 7), (1, 8), ... So (1, 8) is the 4th segment of my body in the current state. I am moving *into* my own body. **DEATH**.\n    *   **DOWN:** (0, 7). The board shows 'T' (Tail) at (0, 7)? No, the board shows '.' at (0, 7) in the diagram? Let's look at the diagram again.\n        Row 8: `1 T . . T T . . . .`\n        Head is (0, 8). (0, 7) is in Row 7.\n        Row 7: `T T . . . . . . . .`\n        (0, 7) is 'T'. So (0, 7) is my body.\n    Wait, let's map the body list to the board:\n    Body: `[(0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8)]`\n    Board Row 8: `1 T . . T T ...`\n    (0, 8): Head (1)\n    (1, 8): Body (T)\n    Board Row 7: `T T . . . . ...`\n    (0, 7): Body (T)\n    (1, 7): Body (T)\n    Board Row 9: `T T T T T T ...`\n    (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9) are all T.\n    Board Row 6: `.` at (0, 6) and (1, 6).\n    \n    So, if I am at (0, 8):\n    *   **UP (0, 9):** `T`. Occupied. **DEAD**.\n    *   **LEFT (-1, 8):** Off board. **DEAD**.\n    *   **RIGHT (1, 8):** `T` (Body segment). **DEAD**.\n    *   **DOWN (0, 7):** `T` (Body segment). **DEAD**.\n    \n    Okay, if I am truly at (0, 8) surrounded by my own body on all 3 valid sides and the wall on the 4th, I am dead. This is a trap.\n    \n    However, let's re-read the prompt's \"Last Move\" carefully. \"Your last move information... UP\". This confirms the move made was UP.\n    And \"START LAST RATIONALE\" from the previous turn says: \"Head at (0, 7). ... UP: Target (0, 8). This is an Apple.\"\n    So the previous turn I was at (0, 7), I moved UP to (0, 8).\n    The prompt gives the board state for the *current* turn (Turn 40).\n    \n    Let's look at the Board State provided:\n    Row 8: `1 T . . T T . . . .`\n    The '1' is at column 0. The 'T' is at column 1.\n    This implies my body is immediately to the right of my head.\n    Wait, the body list is `[(0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), ...]`.\n    If I just ate and moved to (0, 8):\n    - Old tail (4, 8) stays.\n    - Old body segments shift.\n    - The segment that was at (0, 7) moves to (0, 8)? No, the head moves to (0, 8). The segment that was at (0, 7) is the *next* segment.\n    So at Turn 40 start:\n    - Head: (0, 8)\n    - Segment 2: (0, 7)\n    - Segment 3: (1, 7)\n    - Segment 4: (1, 8)\n    \n    So at (0, 8): Head.\n    At (0, 7): Body.\n    At (1, 8): Body.\n    \n    So moving DOWN hits (0, 7).\n    Moving RIGHT hits (1, 8).\n    Moving UP hits (0, 9).\n    Moving LEFT hits wall.\n    \n    Is there *any* escape?\n    Maybe I am not at (0, 8)? Let's double check the \"Your Snake\" block.\n    \"Head: (0, 8)\" - Yes.\n    So I am definitely at (0, 8).\n    \n    Is it possible the body list in \"Your Snake\" represents the state *after* the move? Usually, yes.\n    \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n    \"Your Snake (ID: 1): Head: (0, 8). Body: [(0, 7), (1, 7), ...]\"\n    \n    Is there a possibility I am misinterpreting \"Body\"?\n    If the body list is the state *before* the move, and I am calculating the *next* move.\n    If the body list is the state *after* the move, then I am calculating based on the current state.\n    \n    The prompt says: \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail... Turn: 40 / 150\".\n    Usually, the prompt provides the state *at the start of the turn*.\n    So I am at (0, 8) *now*.\n    \n    Let's re-examine the board diagram for visual confirmation.\n    ` 9 . T T T T T . . . .`\n    ` 8 1 T . . T T . . . .`\n    ` 7 T T . . . . . . . .`\n    \n    Head '1' at (0, 8).\n    'T' at (1, 8).\n    'T' at (0, 7).\n    'T' at (1, 7).\n    \n    I am trapped in a box made by my own body?\n    Wait, the board shows 'A' at (0, 8) in the \"Apples\" list, but the board diagram shows '1'.\n    So I ate the apple.\n    \n    If I am trapped, the game should be over. But I am being asked for a move.\n    Is there a mistake in my reading?\n    \n    Let's look at the \"Last Rationale\" again from the prompt.\n    It says: \"I have successfully moved to (0, 7) and blocked the wall. I need to immediately turn up to (0, 8) to eat the apple...\"\n    Then it says: \"The apple at (0, 8) is the priority.\"\n    \n    Wait. The \"Last Rationale\" in the prompt is what *I* wrote in the *previous* turn.\n    In the previous turn, I was at (0, 7). I moved UP.\n    \n    Let's assume the \"Your Snake\" block in the prompt is the state *before* the \"Last Move\" description is applied?\n    No, \"Turn: 40\". The state is for Turn 40.\n    \n    Maybe I am misreading the board coordinates?\n    \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n    Row 9 is top. Row 8 is below it.\n    So (0, 9) is top left. (0, 8) is below it.\n    \n    Let's look at the board again.\n    Row 8: `1 T . . T T . . . .`\n    This is my head and immediate right body.\n    Row 7: `T T . . . . . . . .`\n    This is my body below.\n    \n    So I am surrounded. Why would I be asked for a move?\n    \n    Perhaps the \"Last Move\" in the prompt description is a simulation of what *would* happen, and I need to correct it?\n    \"You are controlling a snake... Your last move information: UP\".\n    \n    Maybe I am looking at the board wrong?\n    ` 9 . T T T T T . . . .`\n    ` 8 1 T . . T T . . . .`\n    ` 7 T T . . . . . . . .`\n    \n    Is there a gap?\n    (1, 8) is T.\n    (2, 8) is .\n    (3, 8) is .\n    (4, 8) is T.\n    (5, 8) is T.\n    \n    My body is: `(0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8)`.\n    \n    So my body occupies:\n    (0, 8) Head\n    (0, 7)\n    (1, 7)\n    (1, 8)\n    (1, 9)\n    (2, 9)\n    (3, 9)\n    (4, 9)\n    (5, 9)\n    (5, 8)\n    (4, 8)\n    \n    This is a continuous line.\n    From (0, 8) I can go:\n    Up: (0, 9) -> 'T' (from list? No, list doesn't have (0, 9) explicitly, but the board has 'T' at (0, 9)).\n    Let's check the list again. `[(0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), ...]`.\n    The list is the body. The head is separate.\n    Total length is 11 (10 apples + 1 initial? No, apples: 10).\n    If I ate 10 apples, my length is roughly 10 + initial length.\n    The list has 10 coordinates. The head is 1.\n    So length is 11.\n    My list covers 10 cells. Head covers 1.\n    Where is the segment behind the head?\n    The list is head-to-tail. So (0, 7) is the segment behind the head.\n    \n    So moving DOWN to (0, 7) is suicide.\n    Moving RIGHT to (1, 8) is suicide (it is in the list).\n    Moving UP to (0, 9).\n    What is at (0, 9)?\n    The board shows `T`.\n    Is (0, 9) in my list? No.\n    So (0, 9) is occupied by... something. The board says 'T'.\n    If it's not my body (per the list provided), it must be the tail?\n    Wait, the list ends at `(4, 8)`.\n    But the body must be continuous.\n    Let's trace the list:\n    (0, 7) -> (1, 7) (Right)\n    (1, 7) -> (1, 8) (Up)\n    (1, 8) -> (1, 9) (Up)\n    (1, 9) -> (2, 9) (Right)\n    (2, 9) -> (3, 9) (Right)\n    (3, 9) -> (4, 9) (Right)\n    (4, 9) -> (5, 9) (Right)\n    (5, 9) -> (5, 8) (Down)\n    (5, 8) -> (4, 8) (Left)\n    \n    So the tail is (4, 8).\n    The head is (0, 8).\n    The segment immediately following the head is (0, 7).\n    \n    So what is at (0, 9)?\n    The board has a 'T' at (0, 9) in Row 9.\n    ` 9 . T T T T T . . . .`\n    Column 0 is '.'.\n    Column 1 is 'T'.\n    Wait.\n    ` 9 . T T T T T . . . .`\n    ` 8 1 T . . T T . . . .`\n    \n    (0, 9) is column 0, row 9. The board shows '.' at (0, 9).\n    (1, 9) is column 1, row 9. The board shows 'T'.\n    \n    My head is (0, 8).\n    So (0, 9) is UP.\n    It is '.' (Empty).\n    (1, 9) is part of my body (and 'T' on board).\n    \n    Okay, so moving UP is safe? The board shows '.' at (0, 9).\n    \n    Wait, the board shows:\n    ` 9 . T T T T T . . . .`\n    The first character is at x=0. So (0, 9) is '.'.\n    (1, 9) is 'T'.\n    \n    So moving UP to (0, 9) is empty.\n    Moving RIGHT to (1, 8) is 'T' (my body).\n    Moving DOWN to (0, 7) is 'T' (my body).\n    Moving LEFT is wall.\n    \n    So I can only move UP.\n    \n    However, I just ate. If I move UP, where does my tail go?\n    Since I ate, the tail stays at (4, 8).\n    The body shifts.\n    Old head (0, 8) -> Body (0, 8).\n    Old (0, 7) -> (0, 8)? No.\n    Chain: (0, 8) Head -> (0, 7) Segment 2 -> ...\n    If I move Head to (0, 9):\n    New Head: (0, 9).\n    Segment 2 becomes old head (0, 8).\n    Segment 3 becomes old (0, 7).\n    ...\n    Tail stays at (4, 8).\n    \n    So next state:\n    Head: (0, 9)\n    Body includes (0, 8), (0, 7), etc.\n    \n    Is (0, 9) safe *next* turn?\n    No, that's the next turn.\n    For *this* turn, I just need to pick a move that doesn't kill me *now*.\n    \n    **Current Head: (0, 8)**\n    **Possible Moves:**\n    - UP: (0, 9). Board says '.'. Safe.\n    - LEFT: (-1, 8). Off board. Dead.\n    - RIGHT: (1, 8). Board says 'T'. My body. Dead.\n    - DOWN: (0, 7). Board says 'T'. My body. Dead.\n    \n    So the only safe move is UP.\n    \n    But wait, the \"Last Rationale\" said \"I have successfully moved to (0, 7) and blocked the wall. I need to immediately turn up to (0, 8) to eat the apple...\"\n    And the \"Last Move\" was \"UP\".\n    So I am at (0, 8).\n    \n    There is an apple at (0, 8) in the \"Apples at\" list.\n    So I am standing on an apple.\n    If I move UP, I leave the apple?\n    No, I am *at* the apple. I just moved there.\n    So I have eaten it.\n    The \"Apples at\" list provided in the prompt includes (4, 3), (8, 6), (5, 2), (1, 6), (3, 5).\n    It does *not* include (0, 8).\n    So (0, 8) was the apple, and I ate it. It is no longer an apple.\n    \n    So I am at (0, 8). I need to move.\n    UP is the only safe move.\n    \n    Let me double check the board for (0, 9).\n    Row 9: ` . T T T T T . . . .`\n    Index 0 is '.'.\n    So (0, 9) is safe.\n    \n    Is there any other option?\n    Is it possible to go through my own body if I am long? No.\n    Is it possible the board is 10x10 so x goes 0..9? Yes.\n    \n    So the decision is UP.\n    \n    Wait, if I go UP to (0, 9), I am walking into a tight spot.\n    Next turn, I will be at (0, 9). My body will fill (0, 8), (0, 7), etc.\n    I will be blocked on the left (wall).\n    Right will be (1, 9), which is my body (in the current state).\n    But in the next state, (1, 9) will be empty? No, my body is there.\n    My body is `(0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), ...`\n    So (1, 9) is my body.\n    If I am at (0, 9), (1, 9) is to my right.\n    It will be occupied by my body.\n    Down will be (0, 8), my body.\n    Left is wall.\n    So if I move UP to (0, 9), I will be trapping myself next turn (unless I can go Right, but (1, 9) is occupied).\n    \n    Is there any other move?\n    Is it possible I can go DOWN?\n    (0, 7) is 'T'.\n    \n    Is it possible I can go RIGHT?\n    (1, 8) is 'T'.\n    \n    What about the gap at (2, 8)?

The only valid move is UP to (0, 9). After moving UP, my tail will remain at (4, 8) because I just consumed an apple. My immediate priority is to survive this turn. In the coming turns, I must maneuver towards the central apples ((3, 5), (4, 3), etc.) to open up space, as I am currently trapped in the corner.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nAfter analyzing the board state, I have evaluated the following moves from my current position at (0, 8):\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 9):** The board shows an empty cell ('.') at (0, 9). My body occupies (1, 9), but not (0, 9). This is a safe move.\n2.  **LEFT to (-1, 8):** This is off the board, which results in immediate death.\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 8):** The board shows 'T' (part of my body) at (1, 8). This move results in immediate death.\n4.  **DOWN to (0, 7):** The board shows 'T' (part of my body) at (0, 7). This move results in immediate death.\n\nThe only legal and safe move is UP.\n\nUP",

Also moves toward apple (4,3) or (5,2) eventually.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note**  \nEnemy likely dies this turn \u2192 I win immediately. If not, continue toward apples (8,6) or (5,2) from central position. Keep away from walls to avoid traps.\n\nLEFT",
