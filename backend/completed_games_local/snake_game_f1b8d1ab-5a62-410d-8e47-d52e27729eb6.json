My last move was LEFT, so my previous head position was (2,4) and my body is currently just the head, no tail segment yet since I haven't eaten an apple.  \n\n**Immediate safety check:**  \n- UP to (1,5): That cell is empty. Safe.  \n- DOWN to (1,3): Empty. Safe.  \n- LEFT to (0,4): That\u2019s an apple cell. Eating an apple is safe (no collision with other snakes\u2019 bodies there).  \n- RIGHT to (2,4): That was my previous head position, but since I have no body yet (length 1), moving backwards into where I just came from is allowed? Wait \u2014 the rules say: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" My body is currently none, so moving RIGHT into (2,4) is just moving into an empty cell. That should be safe because my body isn\u2019t there yet. But careful: if I had eaten an apple last turn, my tail would remain behind and that cell would be occupied. Right now, I have no tail, so (2,4) is free. So RIGHT is safe.  \n\nAll four moves are safe this turn.  \n\n**Consider enemy snake (#1):**  \nHead at (0,5), body at (0,6). Possible moves for enemy:  \n- UP to (0,6) \u2192 into its own body \u2192 invalid/death.  \n- DOWN to (0,4) \u2192 apple cell, and my possible move LEFT also goes to (0,4).  \n- LEFT \u2192 off-board (x=-1) \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT to (1,5) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe moves are DOWN to (0,4) or RIGHT to (1,5).  \n\n**Head-on collision risk:**  \nIf I go LEFT to (0,4) and enemy goes DOWN to (0,4), we collide head-on \u2192 both die. That\u2019s risky.  \nIf I go UP to (1,5) and enemy goes RIGHT to (1,5), same head-on collision risk.  \nIf I go DOWN to (1,3) or RIGHT to (2,4), enemy cannot reach those cells this turn (enemy can only go to (0,4) or (1,5)), so those are safe from head-on.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nApples at: (5,3), (0,4), (0,9), (9,1), (8,3).  \nClosest is (0,4) Manhattan distance 1 (LEFT), but risky due to possible enemy move there.  \nNext closest: (0,9) is far; (9,1) far; (8,3) distance |1-8|+|4-3|=7; (5,3) distance |1-5|+|4-3|=4.  \n\nGoing DOWN to (1,3) gets me closer to (5,3) (now distance 3) and (8,3) (distance 6).  \nGoing RIGHT to (2,4) gets me slightly farther from most apples except maybe (5,3) distance 4.  \n\n**Future options:**  \nAfter DOWN to (1,3), my possible next moves: UP (back to (1,4)), LEFT (0,3), RIGHT (2,3), DOWN (1,2) \u2014 all likely safe unless enemy moves into them.  \nAfter RIGHT to (2,4), next moves: UP (2,5), DOWN (2,3), LEFT (back to (1,4)), RIGHT (3,4) \u2014 also good.  \n\nGiven enemy could threaten (0,4) and (1,5), safest are DOWN or RIGHT. Between them, DOWN gets me closer to two apples (5,3) and (8,3) while avoiding head-on risk.  \n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**  \nAfter moving DOWN to (1,3), next turn consider moving toward (5,3) via RIGHT moves, while watching enemy\u2019s position. If enemy stays north, I can continue toward apples along bottom half. Avoid getting trapped in left column if enemy descends.  \n\n**Final choice:** DOWN.  \n\nDOWN",

So all are immediately safe.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy snake\u2019s possible moves**\n\nEnemy head at (3,5), body at (2,5).  \nEnemy possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (3,6) \u2013 safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,4) \u2013 safe (but note: this is where my UP would go).\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,5) \u2013 into its own body (illegal).\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,5) \u2013 safe.\n\nSo enemy can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision**\n\nIf I go UP to (3,4) and enemy goes DOWN to (3,4), we collide head-on and both die. That\u2019s risky.  \nIf I go DOWN to (3,2), enemy can\u2019t reach that this turn.  \nIf I go LEFT to (2,3), enemy can\u2019t reach that.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (4,3), enemy can\u2019t reach that.\n\nSo UP has a possible head-on collision if enemy chooses DOWN.  \nEnemy might choose DOWN to chase apple at (5,3)? Actually apple at (5,3) is closer to me (distance 2) than to enemy (distance \u221a8 \u2248 2.8). Enemy might go DOWN to get closer to that apple, so UP is risky.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity**\n\nClosest apple to me: (5,3) distance |5-3|+|3-3|=2.  \nNext closest: (8,3) distance 5, (0,4) distance |0-3|+|4-3|=4, (0,9) distance 9, (9,1) distance 8.\n\nRIGHT moves me toward (5,3) and (8,3).  \nUP moves me toward (0,4) but also toward (0,9) indirectly.  \nLEFT moves me away from most apples except (0,4).  \nDOWN moves me away from most apples.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility**\n\nFrom each candidate cell after move:\n- UP to (3,4): neighbors: (3,5) enemy head now, (3,3) my previous head (empty next turn), (2,4) empty, (4,4) empty \u2192 2 safe moves next turn? Wait, (3,5) is enemy head now, but enemy will move away possibly. Still, risky because enemy could stay.\n- DOWN to (3,2): neighbors all empty \u2192 4 safe moves next turn.\n- LEFT to (2,3): neighbors: (2,4) empty, (2,2) empty, (1,3) empty, (3,3) empty \u2192 4 safe moves.\n- RIGHT to (4,3): neighbors: (4,4) empty, (4,2) empty, (3,3) empty, (5,3) apple \u2192 4 safe moves (apple cell is safe to enter).\n\nRIGHT gives good mobility and moves toward closest apple.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**\n\nWe\u2019re still short (length 1). Priority is to grab first apple safely without dying.  \nEnemy has length 2, so in a head-to-head collision, they\u2019d win (longer snake survives). So I must avoid head-on collisions entirely until I\u2019m longer.\n\nGiven enemy at (3,5), safest moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. RIGHT progresses toward apple (5,3) and keeps distance from enemy.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nMove RIGHT toward (5,3), but watch enemy movement. If enemy moves toward same apple, consider diverting to (8,3) or (0,4) instead. Avoid moving upward into enemy\u2019s possible path.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nRIGHT \u2013 safe, progresses toward closest apple, avoids head-on risk, maintains mobility.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,3): That's my own body segment. **Danger - would die.**\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,3): Contains an apple. Moving onto an apple is safe (we eat it before collision checks with bodies). But need to check if another snake's head could also move there simultaneously.\n\n**Enemy snake #1's possible moves from (7,5):**\nFrom (7,5), enemy can move UP to (7,6), DOWN to (7,4), LEFT to (6,5) (its own body), RIGHT to (8,5). So enemy cannot reach (8,3) in one move. However, enemy could move DOWN to (7,4). That's adjacent to my current head but not to (8,3).\n\n**Head-on collision risk at (8,3):**\nNo other snake head can reach (8,3) in one move from their positions. Enemy at (7,5) is 2 squares away. So moving RIGHT to (8,3) to eat the apple appears safe from simultaneous head collision.\n\n**Other considerations:**\n- Eating the apple at (8,3) would grow me next turn (my tail stays put while I add a new head segment).\n- After eating, my body will be: head at (8,3), then (7,3), then (6,3) as tail. That's length 3.\n- My current length is 2 (head + one body segment). Eating would make me longer than enemy (who currently has length 2 as well, same as me).\n- Remaining apples: after eating (8,3), four apples remain.\n\n**Alternative safe moves:**\nUP to (7,4): Safe, but puts me closer to enemy at (7,5). Enemy could move DOWN to (7,4) same turn, causing head-on collision (same length, both die). That's risky.\nDOWN to (7,2): Safe, moves away from enemy and apples, but keeps options open.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turns:**\nAfter eating apple at (8,3), I'll be at (8,3) with body (7,3),(6,3). Next turn, I should avoid moving LEFT back into my body. Consider moving UP/DOWN/RIGHT to stay safe and target next nearest apple (maybe (9,1) or (0,4)). Keep an eye on enemy snake #1's position and possible movements to avoid head-on collisions.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT to (8,3) is safe (no self-collision, no board edge, no enemy body there, and no other head can reach it this turn). It gives me an apple, increasing my score to 2, putting me ahead of enemy (1 apple). It's the highest-value safe move.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #1 head at (7,7), body [(7,6)]. I have 2 apples, enemy has 1.\n\n**2. Immediate safety check for each direction from (8,2):**  \n- UP \u2192 (8,3): That's my own body segment (second segment). **Danger \u2013 would die.**  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,1): Empty. Safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,2): Empty. Safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,2): On board, empty. Safe.\n\n**3. Enemy snake #1\u2019s possible moves from (7,7):**  \nEnemy can move UP to (7,8), DOWN to (7,6) (its own body), LEFT to (6,7), RIGHT to (8,7).  \nNone of these reach my considered squares (8,1), (7,2), (9,2) in one move.  \nNo immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**4. Apple proximity:**  \nFrom (8,2):  \n- Closest apple is (9,1) (Manhattan distance = |9-8| + |1-2| = 1+1 = 2).  \n- Next closest: (1,2) distance = 7, (4,9) = 11, (0,4) = 10, (0,9) = 15.  \n\nLet's check each safe move's effect on distance to (9,1):  \n- DOWN to (8,1): distance to (9,1) = |9-8| + |1-1| = 1 \u2192 improves by 1.  \n- LEFT to (7,2): distance = |9-7| + |1-2| = 2+1 = 3 \u2192 worsens by 1.  \n- RIGHT to (9,2): distance = |9-9| + |1-2| = 0+1 = 1 \u2192 improves by 1.\n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT both get me equally close (distance 1) to (9,1), but from different positions.\n\n**5. Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n- DOWN to (8,1):  \n  Next turn head at (8,1), body will be [(8,2), (8,3), (7,3)] (length 4).  \n  From (8,1), safe moves likely UP, DOWN, LEFT (RIGHT to (9,1) only if apple is still there and no enemy moves into it). Good flexibility.\n\n- RIGHT to (9,2):  \n  Next turn head at (9,2), body [(8,2), (8,3), (7,3)].  \n  From (9,2), on right edge: safe moves UP to (9,3), DOWN to (9,1) (if apple there), LEFT to (8,2) (own body next turn? Wait: body will be [(9,2), (8,2), (8,3), (7,3)], so (8,2) is my second segment, so LEFT into (8,2) would be fatal next turn). That means from (9,2), only UP and DOWN may be safe, LEFT into own body. More restrictive.\n\n- LEFT to (7,2):  \n  Next turn head at (7,2), body [(8,2), (8,3), (7,3)].  \n  From (7,2), safe moves likely UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (all possibly open unless enemy moves). Good flexibility but moves away from nearest apple.\n\n**6. Risk of enemy reaching apple (9,1) before me:**  \nEnemy at (7,7) is 6 moves away from (9,1). I'm 1 move away if I go RIGHT to (9,2) this turn, then DOWN next turn. If I go DOWN to (8,1) this turn, I can go RIGHT to (9,1) next turn. Both get me to apple in 2 moves.  \nBut enemy could theoretically move toward it over several turns. However, with distance 6, I should get there first if I commit.\n\n**7. Long-term plan note:**  \nAfter eating (9,1), consider targeting (1,2) or (4,9) while avoiding boxing myself. Keep an eye on enemy's movement pattern\u2014it may try to cut me off. With longer body, plan routes that don't trap me. Prefer central/open areas for maneuverability.\n\n**Decision:**  \nBoth DOWN and RIGHT bring me equally close to the nearest apple (9,1). DOWN gives better future mobility (more safe options next turn). RIGHT puts me on the edge with fewer safe moves next turn.  \nTherefore, DOWN is the better choice for safety and flexibility while progressing toward the apple.\n\nDOWN",

DOWN is eliminated (off board).\n\n**Available moves:** UP to (7,2) or LEFT to (6,1)\n\n**Checking for potential collisions with enemy movement:**\nEnemy snake (#1) at (7,9) with body at (7,8). Their possible moves:\n- UP (7,10): Off board \u2192 invalid\n- DOWN (7,8): Into their own body \u2192 would die\n- LEFT (6,9): Empty\n- RIGHT (8,9): Empty\n\nSo enemy's safe moves are LEFT to (6,9) or RIGHT to (8,9).\n\n**Checking head-on collision possibilities:**\nIf I move UP to (7,2), enemy could move to (6,9) or (8,9) - no collision risk.\nIf I move LEFT to (6,1), enemy could move to (6,9) - different y-coordinate, so no collision.\n\n**Future mobility analysis:**\nIf I move UP to (7,2):\n- Next turn from (7,2): UP(7,3), DOWN(7,1), LEFT(6,2), RIGHT(8,2)\n- DOWN(7,1) would go into my current head position (7,1) which will be empty next turn\n- My body will be at (8,1), (8,2), and old head (7,1) becomes body\n- So from (7,2) next turn: UP(7,3) empty, DOWN(7,1) empty (was my head, now body), LEFT(6,2) empty, RIGHT(8,2) occupied by my body\n- So RIGHT would be blocked by my body, giving me 3 safe directions\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,1):\n- Next turn from (6,1): UP(6,2), DOWN(6,0), LEFT(5,1), RIGHT(7,1)\n- DOWN(6,0) would be off board \u2192 invalid\n- My body will be at (7,1), (8,1), (8,2)\n- RIGHT(7,1) would be occupied by my body\n- So from (6,1) next turn: UP(6,2) empty, LEFT(5,1) empty, but DOWN invalid and RIGHT blocked\n- This gives me only 2 safe directions next turn\n\n**Apple proximity:**\n- Apple at (9,1) is 2 cells away (RIGHT, RIGHT) but I can't go RIGHT now\n- Apple at (1,2) is 6 cells away (6 left, 1 up)\n- Apple at (0,4) is 7 cells away\n- Apple at (0,9) is 9 cells away\n- Apple at (4,9) is 8 cells away\n\nMoving UP gets me closer to (1,2) and (0,4). Moving LEFT gets me closer to (1,2) but away from (9,1).\n\n**Strategic consideration:**\nThe enemy snake is at the top of the board (y=9) and will likely move toward apples (0,9) or (4,9). I'm at the bottom with 2 apples already collected vs enemy's 1 apple. I should focus on safe growth while avoiding getting trapped.\n\n**Decision:**\nUP gives me better future mobility (3 options next turn vs 2) and moves me toward the cluster of apples at (1,2) and (0,4). LEFT gives me fewer options next turn and potentially limits my movement space.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:** After moving UP to (7,2), consider moving toward (1,2) apple while maintaining distance from enemy who's likely heading toward top-row apples. Avoid getting trapped against left wall. Monitor enemy's movement pattern - they might move toward (0,9) or (4,9).\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Looking at the board, my snake (ID 0, head at (1,3)) has body segments at (1,2), (2,2), (3,2). The tail is at (3,2). Enemy snake #1's head is at (0,8) with a long body trailing down the left side.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible move:\n\n**UP to (1,4):** This cell is empty. It's safe from immediate self-collision (my body is at (1,2), (2,2), (3,2)). It's within board bounds. It doesn't move into enemy snake #1's body (its body runs along (0,9)-(3,9) and (0,8) is its head). However, I need to consider where enemy #1 might move. Its head is at (0,8). It could move UP to (0,9) (its own body, would kill it), DOWN to (0,7) (empty), LEFT is off-board, RIGHT to (1,8) (empty). So DOWN or RIGHT are likely safe moves for it. A head-on collision would require both of us moving into the same cell. From (1,3) UP to (1,4) and enemy from (0,8) RIGHT to (1,8) does not collide. From (0,8) DOWN to (0,7) also no collision. So UP seems safe.\n\n**DOWN to (1,2):** This is directly into my own body segment (the first body segment after my head). This would kill me. **ELIMINATED.**\n\n**LEFT to (0,3):** This cell is empty. It's within bounds. It's not my body. It's not enemy #1's body (its body is at y=9). However, enemy #1 at (0,8) could move DOWN to (0,7), LEFT is off-board, RIGHT to (1,8), UP to (0,9) (its body). If enemy moves DOWN to (0,7), no collision. But if enemy moves RIGHT to (1,8), also no collision. However, moving LEFT puts me closer to the apple at (0,4) which is two steps away (LEFT then UP). But I need to consider immediate safety: moving LEFT to (0,3) seems safe from self and enemy body.\n\n**RIGHT to (2,3):** This cell is empty. It's within bounds. It's not my body. It's not enemy #1's body. Enemy #1's possible moves: from (0,8) to (0,7), (1,8), or (0,9). No direct collision. Safe.\n\nAll moves except DOWN are immediately safe from board boundaries and own body. Now, which move is strategically best?\n\n**Apples:** There are apples at (0,4), (9,1), (6,4), (7,6), (3,6). My head is at (1,3).\n- Apple at (0,4): Distance Manhattan: |1-0| + |3-4| = 1+1=2. Path: LEFT then UP.\n- Apple at (3,6): Distance: |1-3| + |3-6| = 2+3=5. Path: RIGHT twice then UP three times.\n- Apple at (6,4): Distance: |1-6| + |3-4| = 5+1=6.\n- Apple at (7,6): 6+3=9.\n- Apple at (9,1): 8+2=10.\n\nClosest apple is (0,4). Moving LEFT gets me closer to it (to (0,3)). Moving UP also gets me closer (to (1,4)), but then I'd need LEFT then UP again to reach (0,4), so LEFT is more direct.\n\n**Future options:** Need to avoid getting trapped. Let's check safe follow-up moves from each candidate:\n\nFrom (1,4) after UP: Possible moves: UP to (1,5) empty, DOWN to (1,3) currently my head's old position but will be empty next turn? Actually, if I move UP, my body will shift: head to (1,4), then body segments to old head (1,3) and (1,2), tail (2,2) disappears? Wait, rule: if I don't eat an apple, my tail moves forward, so my body occupies: new head (1,4), then (1,3), (1,2), (2,2)? Actually, my current body: head (1,3), then (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) tail. If I move UP without eating, new head (1,4), body becomes [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)] and tail (3,2) disappears. So from (1,4), adjacent cells: UP (1,5) empty, DOWN (1,3) will be my body (occupied), LEFT (0,4) has apple, RIGHT (2,4) empty. So three possible moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT), but LEFT leads to apple which is good.\n\nFrom (0,3) after LEFT: Adjacent cells: UP (0,4) apple, DOWN (0,2) empty, RIGHT (1,3) will be my old head position, empty next turn? Actually, after moving LEFT, my body: head (0,3), then (1,3), (1,2), (2,2). So (1,3) becomes my first body segment. So from (0,3), possible moves: UP to apple (0,4), DOWN to (0,2) empty, LEFT off-board (invalid), RIGHT to (1,3) my body (invalid). So only UP and DOWN are safe follow-ups. That's only two options, which is riskier.\n\nFrom (2,3) after RIGHT: Adjacent cells: UP (2,4) empty, DOWN (2,2) will be my body? After moving RIGHT, my body: head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,2), (2,2). So (2,2) is my last body segment? Wait, my current body: (1,3) head, (1,2), (2,2), (3,2) tail. After RIGHT to (2,3), new body: [(1,3), (1,2), (2,2)], tail (3,2) disappears. So (2,2) is part of my body. So from (2,3), DOWN to (2,2) is invalid. LEFT to (1,3) is my body (invalid). UP to (2,4) empty, RIGHT to (3,3) empty. So two safe follow-ups (UP, RIGHT).\n\nSo UP gives three safe follow-ups, LEFT gives two, RIGHT gives two. UP offers more flexibility.\n\n**Enemy snake #1's likely move:** Its head at (0,8). It might go for the apple at (0,4)? That's far. It might go for (3,6) or (6,4). It could move DOWN to (0,7) to avoid its body. I should avoid moving into its potential path. Moving LEFT to (0,3) puts me directly below it, but it's far away at y=8. Not an immediate threat.\n\n**Risk of head-on collision:** Need to consider where enemy might move. Enemy at (0,8). If I move LEFT to (0,3), enemy would have to move DOWN five steps in one turn to collide, impossible. If I move UP to (1,4), enemy would have to move RIGHT then DOWN many steps, no. So no immediate collision risk.\n\nGiven that UP keeps more future options open and moves me toward the apple at (0,4) (though less directly than LEFT), and LEFT limits my next moves to only two, UP seems better for maintaining flexibility.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Aim for the apple at (0,4) via a safe path. After UP to (1,4), next turn consider LEFT to (0,4) if safe, or continue UP to explore. Avoid moving into corners. Keep an eye on enemy snake #1's long body along the top row; it may come down.\n\n**Final decision:** UP\n\nUP",

Manhattan distance: from (0,4) to (5,3) is |5|+|1|=6. From (0,3) to (5,3) is |5|+|0|=5, so yes, DOWN reduces distance to (5,3). Also from (0,3) to (3,6) is |3|+|3|=6, while from (0,4) it's |3|+|2|=5, so DOWN increases distance to (3,6). But (5,3) is closer overall.\n\n**Future mobility:**\nIf I go UP to (0,5), my next moves: I'd have body at (0,4),(1,4),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2). From (0,5), possible moves: LEFT off board, RIGHT to (1,5) empty, UP to (0,6) but that's enemy head's current position (they might move), DOWN to (0,4) my own body. So only RIGHT would be safe next turn? That's very limiting.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0,3), my body becomes (0,4),(1,4),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2). From (0,3), possible moves: LEFT off board, RIGHT to (1,3) my own body, UP to (0,4) my own body, DOWN to (0,2) empty. So only DOWN would be safe next turn? That's also limiting, but at least I'm moving toward an apple.\n\nActually, let's check carefully: after moving DOWN, my body segments: head at (0,3), then (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2). Wait, I have 4 apples collected, so my length is 5 segments? Starting length is 1 head + apples collected = 5. Yes, my body list shows 4 segments after head, so total length 5. After moving, I don't grow because no apple eaten, so length stays 5. So my tail will move? Actually in snake, when you move without eating, the tail moves forward. So the tail at (2,2) will move? But we don't know the exact mechanics from description, but typically the tail moves to the previous second-to-last position. However, the board shows my body as a chain. After moving DOWN, my head goes to (0,3), each body segment shifts: the old head becomes new second segment at (0,4), the old second segment (1,4) becomes third, etc., and the tail (2,2) might move to (1,2) if the snake moves straight? Actually it depends on the previous direction. My last move was LEFT, so my tail is at (2,2) and the segment before is (1,2). If I move DOWN, the tail likely stays at (2,2) because the body shifts? Let's think: In typical snake, each segment moves into the position of the segment ahead of it. So the tail (2,2) will move to where the previous segment (1,2) was? But (1,2) is moving to (1,3)? Actually the segment at (1,2) will move to (1,3) because the segment ahead of it (1,3) moves to (1,4)? This is confusing. But for safety checks, we need to know which cells will be occupied by my body next turn. The safe move check already eliminated moves into current body positions. After moving, some body positions change, but we don't need to predict that for this turn's safety.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I should assume that moving DOWN to (0,3) is safe because it's not currently occupied by my body. The potential issue is next turn's mobility.\n\n**Considering enemy's likely move:**\nEnemy at (0,6) with body going up. They might want to go for apple at (3,6) or (7,6). Going RIGHT to (1,6) moves them toward those apples. Going DOWN to (0,5) moves them away from apples. So they are more likely to go RIGHT. That means head-on collision at (0,5) is less likely.\n\nBut if they go RIGHT, they are moving away from me. So UP to (0,5) is probably safe from collision.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI need to navigate toward apples while avoiding getting trapped. Currently, I'm on the left edge. Going UP keeps me on the edge, which is risky because only one safe direction next turn (RIGHT). Going DOWN also keeps me on edge, but maybe I can then go DOWN again to (0,2), then RIGHT to (1,2) etc., to get into the board. However, (1,2) is currently my body segment? Actually (1,2) is my body segment now, but after moving DOWN, it might shift. Let's map out:\n\nCurrent body: head (0,4), then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2). If I move DOWN to (0,3), new head (0,3), then (0,4), (1,4), (1,3), (1,2) \u2014 tail at (1,2)? Actually the last segment (2,2) would become (1,2) if the body shifts? I'm not sure. But regardless, (1,2) will likely be occupied next turn.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0,3), then next turn my only safe move might be DOWN to (0,2) because (1,3) and (0,4) will be body. That's okay, I can go down the edge.\n\nGoing UP to (0,5) then next turn only RIGHT to (1,5) is safe, then from (1,5) I have more options.\n\nComparing the two, UP seems to give me more future options after one move, because from (1,5) I can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT possibly. From (0,2) after two DOWNs, I'm still on edge.\n\nAlso, UP avoids the apple at (5,3) for now, but I can circle back.\n\nGiven the risk of head-on collision if enemy goes DOWN, but that's less likely because enemy wants apples to the right, I'll choose UP.\n\n**Short plan for next turn:** After moving UP to (0,5), likely only RIGHT is safe next turn, so plan to go RIGHT to (1,5) and then assess.\n\nUP",

Actually last move was DOWN from (2,5) to (2,4), so my head moved from (2,5)\u2192(2,4), meaning I'm currently moving DOWN.\n\n**Enemy #1:** Head at (4,6), body segments at (3,6), (2,6), (1,6), (0,6), (0,7). They're facing west? Their head is east of their first body segment (3,6), so they're moving WEST.\n\n**Apples:** (9,1), (6,4), (7,6), (5,3), (6,0)\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from my head (2,4)**\n\n- **UP** to (2,5): Occupied by my own body segment (the segment immediately behind my head) \u2192 deadly (moving backwards into myself).  \n- **DOWN** to (2,3): Currently empty.  \n- **LEFT** to (1,4): Currently empty (my body is at (0,4) and (0,5), (1,5) but not (1,4)).  \n- **RIGHT** to (3,4): Currently empty.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy's possible moves and head-on collision risk**\n\nEnemy head at (4,6). Their safe moves (checking board):\n- UP to (4,7): Empty.\n- DOWN to (4,5): Empty.\n- LEFT to (3,6): Occupied by their own body segment \u2192 deadly.\n- RIGHT to (5,6): Empty.\n\nSo enemy's safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow check if any of my safe moves could cause head-on collision:\n\nMy candidate moves and resulting head positions:\n- DOWN to (2,3): Enemy moving DOWN to (4,5) \u2192 no collision. Enemy moving RIGHT to (5,6) \u2192 no. Enemy moving UP to (4,7) \u2192 no.\n- LEFT to (1,4): Enemy moving DOWN to (4,5) \u2192 no. RIGHT to (5,6) \u2192 no. UP to (4,7) \u2192 no.\n- RIGHT to (3,4): Enemy moving DOWN to (4,5) \u2192 no. RIGHT to (5,6) \u2192 no. UP to (4,7) \u2192 no.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision possible this turn given enemy's safe moves and my safe moves.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and future mobility**\n\nFrom (2,4):\n- Apple at (5,3): Manhattan distance = |5-2|+|3-4| = 3+1=4.\n- Apple at (6,4): distance = 4+0=4.\n- Apple at (7,6): distance = 5+2=7.\n- Apple at (9,1): far.\n- Apple at (6,0): distance = 4+4=8.\n\n**Evaluate each safe move:**\n\n**DOWN to (2,3):**\n- Gets closer to (5,3) (distance 3 vs 4).\n- Gets closer to (6,0) (distance 7 vs 8).\n- Next turn from (2,3): possible moves UP (back to (2,4)), DOWN (2,2), LEFT (1,3), RIGHT (3,3). All look open except UP would go into my neck unless I grow.\n\n**LEFT to (1,4):**\n- Gets slightly closer to (5,3)? Distance becomes |5-1|+|3-4|=4+1=5 (worse than from (2,4)).\n- Gets closer to (9,1)? No.\n- Next turn from (1,4): UP (1,5) is my body \u2192 deadly unless I grow. DOWN (1,3), LEFT (0,4) is my tail (but tail will move if I don't grow?), RIGHT (2,4) is my neck. Actually careful: if I don't eat an apple this turn, my tail (0,4) will move to (0,3)? Let's track: My body: head (2,4), then (2,5), (1,5), (0,5), (0,4) tail. If I move LEFT to (1,4) without eating, the tail (0,4) will vacate, so (0,4) becomes empty next turn. But my neck at (2,4) will become body segment. So from (1,4) next turn: UP (1,5) is my body (from current segment (1,5)), DOWN (1,3) empty, LEFT (0,4) empty (tail moved), RIGHT (2,4) my body. So only DOWN and LEFT would be safe next turn if no growth. That's restrictive.\n\n**RIGHT to (3,4):**\n- Gets closer to (6,4) (distance 3 vs 4).\n- Gets closer to (7,6) (distance 6 vs 7).\n- Next turn from (3,4): UP (3,5) empty, DOWN (3,3) empty, LEFT (2,4) my neck (body next turn), RIGHT (4,4) empty. So three safe directions likely.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Avoid future traps**\n\nEnemy is longer (5 apples vs my 4). They're north-east of me. Moving RIGHT puts me closer to enemy's possible path if they go DOWN to (4,5) then further south. But not immediately dangerous.\n\nThe apple at (6,4) is tempting and reachable via RIGHT then UP/RIGHT. Apple at (5,3) is also reachable via DOWN then RIGHT.\n\nGiven my last move was DOWN, continuing DOWN keeps me south, away from enemy, and toward apple (5,3). LEFT seems to corner me near west wall with fewer options.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Choose**\n\nDOWN seems safe, improves proximity to (5,3), keeps options open next turn (from (2,3) I can go DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT). LEFT is too restrictive. RIGHT is okay but moves me east where enemy might descend.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Move DOWN to (2,3), then likely RIGHT toward (5,3) or (6,4), while monitoring enemy movement. Avoid moving north toward enemy until necessary.\n\nDOWN",

Length = 5.\n- Enemy snake #1: head at (6,6), body segments at (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6). Length = 6.\n- Apples at: (9,1), (6,4), (7,6), (5,3), (6,0).\n\n**My possible moves from (2,2):**\n- UP \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 occupied by my own body \u2192 death.\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 currently empty.\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 currently empty.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 currently empty.\n\nSo UP is immediately fatal (into my own body). DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are potentially safe, but we must consider where enemy snake #1 might move and whether I'd collide with its body after its move.\n\n**Enemy snake #1 head at (6,6).** Its possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (6,7) \u2192 empty.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,5) \u2192 empty.\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,6) \u2192 its own body \u2192 death.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 apple, but also possible collision with me? No, I'm far.\n\nSo enemy likely avoids LEFT (suicide). It might go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. If it goes RIGHT to (7,6), it eats apple and grows; its body next turn will include (6,6) as new segment.\n\nNow, check my safe moves for collisions with enemy's **future body positions** after its move:\n\nIf enemy moves:\n1. UP to (6,7): its body becomes [(6,7), (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6)].\n2. DOWN to (6,5): body becomes [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6), ...].\n3. RIGHT to (7,6): body becomes [(7,6), (6,6), (5,6), ...].\n\nIn all cases, its body includes (6,6) and previous segments. None of my potential moves (2,1), (1,2), (3,2) are in those positions. So no immediate collision risk with enemy's body.\n\nBut what about **head-on collision**? My head moving into same cell as enemy's head this turn:\n- My DOWN to (2,1) vs enemy anywhere \u2192 no overlap.\n- My LEFT to (1,2) vs enemy anywhere \u2192 no overlap.\n- My RIGHT to (3,2) vs enemy anywhere \u2192 no overlap.\n\nSo all three moves are safe from immediate death.\n\nNow, which is best strategically?\n\n**Apple proximity:**\n- (6,4) is at x=6, y=4. From (2,2), moving RIGHT gets me closer in x-direction. DOWN moves away from it. LEFT moves away.\n- (5,3) is at (5,3). Again RIGHT is better.\n- (6,0) is far down, but RIGHT then later DOWN could approach.\n- (9,1) and (7,6) are far.\n\nSo RIGHT seems best for approaching apples.\n\n**Future mobility:**\nFrom (3,2):\n- Possible next moves: UP to (3,3) (empty), DOWN to (3,1) (empty), LEFT to (2,2) (empty after I move), RIGHT to (4,2) (empty). Good openness.\n\nFrom (2,1):\n- UP back to (2,2) (empty after I move), DOWN to (2,0) (empty), LEFT to (1,1) (empty), RIGHT to (3,1) (empty). Also okay, but further from apples.\n\nFrom (1,2):\n- UP to (1,3) (empty), DOWN to (1,1) (empty), LEFT to (0,2) (empty), RIGHT to (2,2) (empty). Okay but left side is bit cramped near wall.\n\nRIGHT seems best for both apple proximity and keeping options open.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move toward central area where apples are clustered ((5,3), (6,4)), while keeping distance from enemy snake #1 which is longer and currently near (6,6). Avoid moving up into my own body's trapped area. Consider wrapping down/right to collect lower apples later.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT",

Length = 5.\n- Enemy snake #1: head at (7,6), body at (6,6), (5,6), (4,6), (3,6), (2,6), (1,6). Length = 7.\n- Apples at: (9,1), (6,4), (5,3), (6,0), (7,3).\n\n**My possible moves from (3,2):**\n- UP \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 empty.\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,1) \u2192 empty.\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 occupied by my own body \u2192 death.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 empty.\n\nSo LEFT is immediately fatal. UP, DOWN, RIGHT are potentially safe.\n\n**Enemy snake #1 head at (7,6).** Its possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (7,7) \u2192 empty.\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,5) \u2192 empty.\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 its own body \u2192 death.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 empty.\n\nEnemy avoids LEFT. It could go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nNow check for **head-on collision** with enemy's possible moves:\n- My UP to (3,3) vs enemy's possible heads (7,7), (7,5), (8,6) \u2192 no overlap.\n- My DOWN to (3,1) vs enemy \u2192 no overlap.\n- My RIGHT to (4,2) vs enemy \u2192 no overlap.\n\nSo no immediate head-on risk.\n\nCheck for moving into enemy's **future body** after its move:\nEnemy's body next turn will include (7,6) as segment (since head moves away). None of my target cells are (7,6). So safe.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\n- (5,3) and (6,4) are east/northeast. UP moves closer to (5,3) in y-direction, but RIGHT moves closer in x-direction.\n- (7,3) is east/south. DOWN moves away from it.\n- (9,1) and (6,0) are southeast/south.\n\nGiven my body blocks west, moving east (RIGHT) opens space and keeps me nearer the cluster at (5,3)/(6,4). UP also approaches but may lead into tighter area near top later.\n\n**Future mobility from each option:**\n- UP to (3,3): Next moves: UP (3,4) empty, DOWN (3,2) empty (my old head), LEFT (2,3) my body, RIGHT (4,3) empty. Some options.\n- DOWN to (3,1): Next moves: UP (3,2) empty, DOWN (3,0) empty, LEFT (2,1) empty, RIGHT (4,1) empty. More open.\n- RIGHT to (4,2): Next moves: UP (4,3) empty, DOWN (4,1) empty, LEFT (3,2) empty, RIGHT (5,2) empty. Very open.\n\nRIGHT seems best for keeping options open and moving toward apples.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move east toward apple cluster (5,3)/(6,4) while staying flexible. Avoid moving north into my own body's vertical line at x=2. Consider circling south later to pick up (6,0) and (9,1) if enemy is distracted.\n\n**Final move:** RIGHT",

Since the game ends at 50 apples, scoring is important.\nRIGHT (6,2) keeps all options open and positions me well for (6,4) or (7,3) next turn, but delays eating.\nGiven enemy's proximity to (6,4) and (7,3), I should secure the apple I can definitely get now: (5,3).\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After eating apple at (5,3), my body will be: head at (5,3), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3). Avoid moving DOWN into (5,2). Consider moving UP to (5,4) or RIGHT to (6,3) to target remaining apples. Watch enemy #1's move; it may have eaten (6,4) or (7,3).\n\n**Final move:** UP",

After that, reassess and pivot toward (6,4) or other apples while avoiding self-collisions and enemy head-ons.\n\nLong-term note to self:\n- Maintain distance from Snake #0 when apples are not immediately accessible; gradually close in on reachable apples (prefer those with a clear path and without causing self-traps).

Eating apples is critical.  \nRIGHT (6,3) risks immediate death if enemy chooses LEFT. Since enemy has three safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT), the probability it chooses LEFT is about 1/3. That\u2019s too risky.  \nLEFT (4,3) moves me toward apple (3,4) and keeps me away from enemy.  \nUP (5,4) also safe and opens paths to multiple apples (6,4) and (2,6).  \nGiven enemy\u2019s position, it may target apple (6,4) by moving LEFT to (6,3) or UP? Actually enemy can\u2019t move UP (blocked). To reach (6,4), enemy could move LEFT to (6,3) then next turn UP to (6,4). If I move RIGHT to (6,3), we collide. If I move UP to (5,4), I can then move RIGHT to (6,4) next turn if enemy doesn\u2019t take it first.  \nApple (6,4) is contested. Moving UP gives me a chance to get it next turn if enemy doesn\u2019t move LEFT this turn. But if enemy moves LEFT to (6,3), it will be adjacent to (6,4) and could take it next turn.  \nApple (3,4) is closer to me and less contested. Moving LEFT toward (3,4) seems safer and still productive.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (4,3), my body: head (4,3), then (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3). Avoid DOWN into (4,2). Target apple (3,4) by moving UP next turn. Watch enemy\u2019s move; if it moves LEFT to (6,3), it may target (6,4). If it moves DOWN or RIGHT, I can consider moving toward (2,6) later.\n\n**Final move:** LEFT",

Puts me closer to the apple at (3,4) than UP does? Actually from (3,3), apple (3,4) is UP, not LEFT. From (4,4), apple (3,4) is LEFT. Both are adjacent next turn.\n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**\n- UP to (4,4): Next turn from (4,4): UP (4,5) empty, DOWN (4,3) empty (my old head), LEFT (3,4) contains apple, RIGHT (5,4) empty.

Securing apple (3,4) is critical. Both UP and LEFT allow me to eat it next turn if I choose the correct direction then (LEFT from (4,4) or UP from (3,3)). However, I must also consider enemy's path. Enemy's head is at (7,2). To reach apple (3,4), enemy would need at least 5 moves (LEFT to (6,2), then UP to (6,3), then LEFT to (5,3), then UP to (5,4), then LEFT to (4,4), then DOWN to (4,3)? Actually that's more). It's far. Apple (6,4) is closer to enemy. Enemy might move LEFT to (6,2) this turn, then next turn could go UP to (6,3) and then UP to (6,4). Apple (6,4) is contested.\n\nMy long-term plan after eating (3,4) should be to target (2,6) or (6,4) while avoiding the enemy's longer body. Since enemy is near the right side, moving leftward might keep me safer. However, moving UP to (4,4) keeps me more central and offers more escape routes.\n\nGiven both moves are safe and have no head-on risk, I'll choose the move that maximizes future options. UP to (4,4) gives me 4 open directions next turn, while LEFT to (3,3) gives me 3 (DOWN is blocked by my own body). UP seems slightly better for flexibility.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving UP to (4,4), apple (3,4) will be to my LEFT. I should take it next turn unless enemy somehow threatens that cell. Also watch enemy's move; if it moves LEFT toward (6,2), it may be aiming for (6,4). I could then consider moving toward (2,6) via LEFT/DOWN after eating (3,4).\n\n**Final move:** UP",

None of my target cells are (7,1). Safe.\n\n**Apple proximity and eating opportunity:**\n- LEFT (3,4): Directly onto apple (3,4). Eating it this turn gains an apple, grows by 1, and increases my lead toward 50.\n- UP (4,5): Moves toward apple (2,6) or (6,4) later, but not immediate.\n- RIGHT (5,4): Moves toward apple (6,4) but also closer to enemy.\n\nEating apple (3,4) now is highly advantageous. It brings me to 6 apples vs enemy\u2019s 7, narrowing the gap. It also grows my body, increasing my length and making me harder to trap.\n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**\n- LEFT to (3,4) (eating apple): Next turn from (3,4): UP (3,5) empty, DOWN (3,3) empty (my old head), LEFT (2,4) empty, RIGHT (4,4) empty (my old head position). All 4 directions open. My new tail will be at (3,2) because I grow by 1 segment.\n- UP to (4,5): Next turn from (4,5): UP (4,6) empty, DOWN (4,4) empty (my old head), LEFT (3,5) empty, RIGHT (5,5) empty. All 4 directions open.\n- RIGHT to (5,4): Next turn from (5,4): UP (5,5) empty, DOWN (5,3) occupied by my body (third segment), LEFT (4,4) empty (my old head), RIGHT (6,4) contains apple. 3 safe moves, one leads to apple.\n\nLEFT offers immediate apple consumption and full mobility next turn. UP offers full mobility but no immediate apple. RIGHT offers 3 safe moves and access to apple (6,4) next turn, but (6,4) is closer to enemy (head at (7,1)) and may be contested.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\nEnemy is longer (length 8 vs my 6) and leads by 2 apples. Securing (3,4) now denies it to enemy and closes the gap. After eating, my head will be at (3,4) with a clear path toward apple (2,6) via LEFT then UP, or toward (6,4) via RIGHT. Since enemy is on the right side, moving leftward toward (2,6) might be safer.\n\nEnemy\u2019s possible moves: DOWN to (7,0) moves away from apples; LEFT to (6,1) moves toward (6,4); RIGHT to (8,1) moves away. Most likely enemy will move LEFT toward (6,4). If I take RIGHT now, I risk moving into its path. Better to take the sure apple now and reassess.\n\n**Long-term plan after eating (3,4):**\nNext turn, from (3,4), assess safety and target apple (2,6) via LEFT then UP, or (6,4) via RIGHT if enemy is not threatening. Avoid moving toward enemy\u2019s long body on the right side. Keep options open.\n\n**Final move:** LEFT",

Moving LEFT now positions me well to reach (2,6) via UP moves. Moving UP also works, but leaves me closer to the center where enemy might encroach.\n\nEnemy's likely move: Since LEFT is fatal, enemy might choose RIGHT to eat apple (9,1) or UP/DOWN to explore. If enemy eats (9,1), it will grow and extend its body further right. That could block my access to right-side apples later, but for now, focusing on left-side apples seems safer.\n\n**Long-term plan after this move:**\nIf I move LEFT to (2,4), next turn aim for apple (2,6) by moving UP twice, while checking safety. Keep an eye on enemy's position; if enemy moves toward (6,4), I might later swing toward (3,1) or (6,0) after securing (2,6). Avoid trapping myself in corners.\n\n**Final move:** LEFT",

However, apple (6,4) is near enemy's body, but enemy might not reach it immediately.\n\nGiven the open board and need to catch up, securing the nearest apple (2,6) seems efficient. UP also keeps me in a less congested area.\n\n**Long-term plan:** After moving UP to (2,5), next turn if safe, move UP to (2,6) to eat the apple.

Apples are at (6,4), (6,0), (2,6), (3,1), (2,0).\n\n**Immediate safety check from (2,5):**\n- **UP \u2192 (2,6):** Contains an apple. Safe (eating apple is allowed).\n- **DOWN \u2192 (2,4):** Occupied by my own body (second segment). **Death.**\n- **LEFT \u2192 (1,5):** Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (3,5):** Empty. Safe.\n\nSo DOWN is fatal. UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 possible moves from (9,0):**\nIts body: [(9,1), (8,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6)]\n- UP \u2192 (9,1): Occupied by its own body (second segment). **Death.**\n- DOWN \u2192 Off board (9,-1). **Death.**\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,0): Empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 Off board (10,0). **Death.**\n\nEnemy only safe move is LEFT to (8,0). So its next head will be at **(8,0)**.\n\n**Head-on collision risk:** My safe target cells are (2,6), (1,5), (3,5). Enemy's next head (8,0) is far away. No conflict.\n\n**Moving into enemy's future body:** Enemy's current head (9,0) will become part of its body next turn. None of my targets are (9,0). Safe.\n\n**Apple proximity and strategy:**\n- **UP to (2,6):** Eats the apple immediately. This grows my snake by 1 (new tail stays at old tail position). This increases my score to 7 apples vs enemy's 8. However, after eating, my head will be at (2,6) and my body will be one segment longer, but the old tail (5,2) remains. This could slightly reduce future mobility near my tail, but the board is still open.\n- **LEFT to (1,5):** Moves away from most apples. Opens space but doesn't score.\n- **RIGHT to (3,5):** Moves toward the center and closer to apple (6,4) and (3,1), but not directly.\n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**\n- **UP to (2,6):** After eating apple, next turn from (2,6): UP (2,7) empty, DOWN (2,5) empty (old head), LEFT (1,6) empty, RIGHT (3,6) empty. All 4 directions open.\n- **LEFT to (1,5):** Next turn from (1,5): UP (1,6) empty, DOWN (1,4) empty, LEFT (0,5) empty, RIGHT (2,5) empty (old head). All 4 directions open.\n- **RIGHT to (3,5):** Next turn from (3,5): UP (3,6) empty, DOWN (3,4) empty (my body at (4,4) but (3,4) is empty? Wait, my body has (4,4) and (3,4) is empty), LEFT (2,5) empty (old head), RIGHT (4,5) empty. All 4 directions open.\n\nAll three safe moves offer full mobility next turn.\n\n**Enemy trajectory:** Enemy is moving LEFT to (8,0). It might then head toward apples (6,0) or (2,0) on the bottom row. I should consider securing apples in the upper half.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Eating apple (2,6) now is efficient and brings me closer to enemy's score. After eating, I can consider moving toward (6,4) or (3,1) while monitoring enemy's movement along the bottom. Since enemy is on the bottom row moving left, it may compete for (6,0) and (2,0). I should focus on apples in the upper half (like (6,4) and (2,6) which I'm about to eat). My position at (2,6) after eating will be safe and central.\n\n**Decision:** UP is the only move that scores immediately, and it's safe. It also keeps future options open. LEFT and RIGHT don't score and don't offer a significant strategic advantage over scoring now.\n\n**Final move:** UP",

However, we should think about future.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\n- Apple at (6,4) is 2 units away in x and 2 in y (Manhattan distance 4).\n- Apple at (4,2) is 1 unit away in x and 4 in y (distance 5).\n- Apple at (3,1) is 2 in x and 5 in y (distance 7).\n- Apple at (2,0) is 3 in x and 6 in y (distance 9).\n- Apple at (8,7) is 3 in x and 1 in y (distance 4).\n\nClosest apples: (6,4) and (8,7) both distance 4.\n\n**Which safe move gets me closer to apples?**\n- UP to (5,7): moves toward (8,7) (distance from (5,7) to (8,7) is 3 horizontally).\n- DOWN to (5,5): moves toward (6,4) (distance from (5,5) to (6,4) is 2).\n- RIGHT to (6,6): moves toward (8,7) (distance from (6,6) to (8,7) is 3) and also toward (6,4) (distance 2 vertically).\n\nRIGHT seems good because it moves toward both (6,4) (down next) and (8,7) (right/up).\n\n**Future mobility:**\nCheck each safe move's next possible moves:\n\nIf I go UP to (5,7):\n- From (5,7), possible next moves: UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7). All likely safe unless enemy moves there.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (5,5):\n- From (5,5), possible next moves: UP (5,6), DOWN (5,4), LEFT (4,5), RIGHT (6,5). DOWN (5,4) is currently empty, but my body is at (4,4) and (3,4) etc., so not immediately adjacent.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,6):\n- From (6,6), possible next moves: UP (6,7), DOWN (6,5), LEFT (5,6), RIGHT (7,6). All likely safe.\n\nAll seem fine, but RIGHT gives me more central positioning and options toward multiple apples.\n\n**Long-term strategy note for next turn:**\nWe have a lead in apples (7 vs 9), but enemy is ahead. Need to catch up. The apple at (6,4) is reachable soon: from (6,6) go DOWN to (6,5) then DOWN to (6,4) if clear. Also consider that enemy is long and mostly at bottom, so upper apples (like (8,7)) might be safer. Keep an eye on enemy's head movement; it's currently at bottom, but could come up. Avoid getting trapped in corners. Prefer moves that keep multiple escape routes.\n\nGiven the above, RIGHT seems the best balance of moving toward apples and maintaining flexibility.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Looking at the board, my snake is at (6,5) heading upward? Let me check the body: head (6,5), next segment (6,6) is directly above, so yes, currently moving UP.  \n\n**Immediate safety check for each direction:**  \n\n- **UP** to (6,6): That's currently occupied by my own body segment (second segment). That would be moving into my own body \u2192 deadly.  \n- **DOWN** to (6,4): Currently empty (board shows '.' at (6,4) \u2014 wait, actually there's an apple at (6,4)? No, looking at the board: row 4 column 6 is '.'? Let's check: Apples list shows (6,4) is an apple, but board shows row 4 column 6 as '.'? Let's reconcile. Coordinates: (x,y) = (6,4) means x=6, y=4. Board row 4 (y=4) col 6 (x=6) shows '.'? Wait, reading board: y=4 row: \". . T . . . A . . .\" \u2014 at x=6, y=4, that's 'A'? Actually reading: row 4: \". . T . . . A . . .\" \u2014 positions: x=0 '.', x=1 '.', x=2 'T', x=3 '.', x=4 '.', x=5 '.', x=6 'A', x=7 '.', x=8 '.', x=9 '.'. So (6,4) is 'A', meaning apple. So DOWN goes to apple. That's safe unless enemy moves there too? But enemy at (4,1) can't reach (6,4) in one move. So DOWN is safe.  \n- **LEFT** to (5,5): Currently empty (board row 5 col 5 is '.'). Safe.  \n- **RIGHT** to (7,5): Currently empty (row 5 col 7 is '.'). Safe.  \n\nSo UP is unsafe (into own body). DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.  \n\n**Enemy snake #1** at (4,1) can move UP to (4,2) (empty), DOWN to (4,0) (its own body? its body: (4,0) is its second segment), LEFT to (3,1) (apple), RIGHT to (5,1) (empty). So likely enemy might go LEFT to eat apple at (3,1) or UP to (4,2) which is empty.  \n\n**My possible moves:**  \n\n1. **DOWN** to (6,4) \u2192 eat apple, grow by 1. But then my new head is at apple, body extends: tail stays, so my length increases, next turn my head at (6,4), body behind: (6,5),(6,6),... That might limit future moves because I'm near bottom? y=4 is not too constrained.  \n\n2. **LEFT** to (5,5) \u2192 moves toward center, keeps options open.  \n\n3. **RIGHT** to (7,5) \u2192 moves toward right side, near apple at (8,7) eventually.  \n\n**Future options:**  \nAfter DOWN to (6,4), next turn possible moves:  \n- From (6,4): UP back to (6,5) (my neck, but will be occupied by my body after growth? Actually after growth, my second segment is (6,5), so UP to (6,5) would be into my body \u2192 unsafe). So UP not safe next turn if I go DOWN now.  \n- From (6,4): LEFT to (5,4) empty, RIGHT to (7,4) empty, DOWN to (6,3) empty. So 3 directions safe. Not bad.  \n\nAfter LEFT to (5,5): next turn from (5,5): UP to (5,6) (my body? currently (5,6) is my 3rd segment), DOWN to (5,4) empty, LEFT to (4,5) empty, RIGHT to (6,5) (my neck, will be occupied after move). So only DOWN and LEFT safe? Wait, after moving LEFT to (5,5), my body: head (5,5), then (6,5), (6,6),... So (5,6) is not part of my body? Actually my current body: head (6,5), then (6,6), (5,6),... So (5,6) is my 3rd segment. After moving LEFT to (5,5), my body becomes: (5,5) head, (6,5) neck, (6,6), (5,6),... So (5,6) is still in my body (4th segment). So UP to (5,6) would be into my body \u2192 unsafe. Similarly RIGHT to (6,5) into neck \u2192 unsafe. So only DOWN and LEFT safe. That's only 2 safe directions \u2192 riskier.  \n\nAfter RIGHT to (7,5): next turn from (7,5): UP to (7,6) empty, DOWN to (7,4) empty, LEFT to (6,5) (my neck, occupied), RIGHT to (8,5) empty. So 3 safe directions.  \n\nSo RIGHT seems best for keeping options open.  \n\nBut eating apple now is good because enemy has 9 apples, I have 7, I need to catch up. Apple at (6,4) is safe to take. Taking it now gains 1 apple, brings me to 8 vs enemy 9.  \n\nAlso, if I go RIGHT, enemy might eat apple at (3,1) and grow, but that's fine.  \n\nLet's check head-on collision risk: enemy at (4,1) cannot reach (6,4) or (5,5) or (7,5) in one move. So no head-on risk.  \n\nSo among safe moves, DOWN gets apple and keeps 3 safe next moves. RIGHT keeps 3 safe next moves but no apple. LEFT only 2 safe next moves.  \n\nI prefer DOWN for apple and decent future mobility.  \n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (6,4), my body will be longer, so avoid UP into (6,5). Prefer LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN to open space. Try to path toward apple at (8,7) or (4,2) while avoiding enemy. Enemy likely heading to (3,1) apple.  \n\nDOWN",

The closest apples to me are (8,6) and (8,7) in the top-right area. I'm at (7,4), so moving RIGHT to (8,4) gets me closer horizontally. Moving UP to (7,5) also gets me closer vertically to (8,6)/(8,7). Moving DOWN to (7,3) takes me away from those apples.\n\n- Enemy position: Snake #1 is at (3,2) with length 10, currently near apples at (2,3), (3,1), (2,0). They're likely to go for those apples. They're far from me (4 columns away), so immediate head-on collision risk is low.\n\n- Future mobility: From (7,4):\n   - If I go RIGHT to (8,4): Next turn safe moves? Possibly UP/DOWN/LEFT? Need to check: From (8,4), my body will be at [(7,4), (6,4), ...]. So LEFT would go back to (7,4) which would be occupied by my new body segment? Actually after moving RIGHT, my head goes to (8,4), and my body shifts: the old head becomes new neck, so (7,4) becomes part of body. So next turn from (8,4), LEFT to (7,4) would be into my own body \u2192 unsafe. So future moves from (8,4): UP to (8,5), DOWN to (8,3), RIGHT to (9,4). That's three possible moves unless board edges or other snakes block. RIGHT to (9,4) is safe? (9,4) is empty now. So three options.\n\n   - If I go UP to (7,5): Next turn from (7,5), body at [(7,4), (6,4), ...]. Possible moves: UP to (7,6), DOWN to (7,4) (occupied by body), LEFT to (6,5) (my body), RIGHT to (8,5). So only UP and RIGHT might be safe. That's two options. Actually DOWN would be into (7,4) which is body \u2192 unsafe. So UP and RIGHT only.\n\n   - If I go DOWN to (7,3): Next turn from (7,3), body at [(7,4), (6,4), ...]. Possible moves: DOWN to (7,2), LEFT to (6,3), RIGHT to (8,3). UP to (7,4) would be body. So three options.\n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT give three future safe moves, UP gives only two. That makes UP slightly less favorable for maintaining options.\n\n- Apple proximity: RIGHT moves me closer to (8,6)/(8,7) horizontally. UP also moves closer vertically. Both are good. But RIGHT might be better because it opens path to go UP next turn to (8,5) then (8,6). From (7,5), going RIGHT to (8,5) then UP to (8,6) is similar.\n\n- Risk assessment: Could Snake #1 move into (8,4) this turn? Their head at (3,2). They could move RIGHT to (4,2), UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2). They can't reach (8,4) in one move. So no immediate head-on collision.\n\n- What about other snakes? Only one enemy snake.\n\n**Decision:** Among safe moves, RIGHT seems best: it gives good future mobility (3 options next turn), moves toward apples, and doesn't reduce options much. UP reduces future moves to 2. DOWN moves away from apples.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (8,4), consider moving UP toward (8,6) apple, but also watch enemy movement. Avoid getting trapped near right wall. Possibly collect (8,6) then (8,7).\n\nRIGHT",

If apple is gone (maybe eaten by enemy?), consider moving RIGHT to (9,5) to stay flexible and avoid being trapped. Monitor enemy movement\u2014if Snake #1 moves toward right side, be ready to evade.

The tail is at (3,6).\n\nApples remain at: (2,0), (8,7), (2,3), (9,2), (1,5).  \nEnemy snake #1 head is at (2,2), body extends as shown.\n\n**Immediate safety check for each move:**\n\n- **UP** to (8,7): Contains an apple. Not off-board, not my body, not enemy body. Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (8,5): That's my own body segment (the cell directly behind my head). Moving DOWN would be moving backwards into my own body \u2192 immediate death. Unsafe.\n- **LEFT** to (7,6): Cell is empty (board shows '.'). Not off-board, not my body, not enemy body. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (9,6): Cell is empty. Not off-board, not my body, not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Strategic evaluation:**\n\n1. **Apple proximity:** The closest apple is directly above me at (8,7). Moving UP eats it immediately, increasing my score to 10. Moving LEFT or RIGHT does not move toward an apple this turn.\n2. **Future mobility:**\n   - From (8,7) after eating: My new head at (8,7), body grows by 1. Next turn safe moves? UP to (8,8) \u2013 empty, DOWN to (8,6) \u2013 body, LEFT to (7,7) \u2013 empty, RIGHT to (9,7) \u2013 empty. So three safe options.\n   - From (7,6): Body at [(8,6), (8,5), ...]. Next moves: UP to (7,7), DOWN to (7,5) \u2013 empty, LEFT to (6,6) \u2013 body, RIGHT to (8,6) \u2013 body. Two safe options (UP, DOWN).\n   - From (9,6): Body at [(8,6), (8,5), ...]. Next moves: UP to (9,7), DOWN to (9,5) \u2013 empty, LEFT to (8,6) \u2013 body, RIGHT off-board. Two safe options (UP, DOWN).\n3. **Enemy threat:** Snake #1 is at (2,2). They are far away and cannot reach my area in one turn. They may be targeting apples at (2,3) or (2,0). No immediate threat.\n4. **Risk of head-on collision:** No enemy can reach (8,7), (7,6), or (9,6) this turn.\n\n**Decision reasoning:**\n\nUP is the best choice:\n- It immediately eats the apple at (8,7), increasing my score to 10 and keeping pace with snake #1 (who has 11).\n- It maintains good future mobility with three safe options next turn.\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT delays eating an apple and offers fewer safe options next turn.\n- Eating apples quickly is critical to catch up and potentially win before the 150-turn limit or by reaching 50 apples.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:**  \nAfter eating (8,7), I'll be at the top edge. Next turn, consider moving UP to (8,8) if safe, or LEFT/RIGHT to explore the top row. Monitor enemy movement\u2014they may be targeting the left-side apples. After securing apples on the right, consider heading toward (9,2) or (1,5) while avoiding potential collisions. Keep an eye on enemy #1's score; they are ahead by 1 apple, so I need to eat more apples soon.\n\n**Final move choice:** UP",

Within bounds (0-9). Not my body (body segments are at (8,7), (8,6), etc.). Not enemy body (enemy body is on left side). Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (8,7): That's my own body segment (the cell directly behind my head). Moving DOWN would be moving backwards into my own body \u2192 immediate death. Unsafe.\n- **LEFT** to (7,8): Cell is empty. Within bounds. Not my body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (9,8): Contains an apple 'A'. Within bounds. Not my body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Strategic evaluation:**\n\n1. **Apple proximity:** The apple at (9,8) is directly adjacent to my right. Moving RIGHT eats it immediately. The apple at (8,2) is six steps away, (1,5) is seven steps away, (9,2) is six steps away, (2,0) is eight steps away.\n2. **Future mobility after each safe move:**\n   - **RIGHT to (9,8)** (eat apple): After eating, my head will be at (9,8), my body grows. Next turn safe moves? UP to (9,9) \u2013 empty, DOWN to (9,7) \u2013 empty, LEFT to (8,8) \u2013 will be my new body segment (since I just ate and grew, the tail won't move this turn? Wait, growth means the tail stays, so (8,8) will become part of my body next turn? Actually, when you eat an apple, you grow by 1 segment at the end of the turn. So after moving RIGHT to (9,8) and eating, my body will be: head (9,8), then previous head (8,8), then (8,7), etc. So (8,8) will be my neck. Next turn, moving LEFT to (8,8) would be moving into my own body \u2192 unsafe. So from (9,8), safe moves would be UP to (9,9) and DOWN to (9,7). That's only two safe options, and DOWN leads to (9,7) which then has UP (back to (9,8)-body), DOWN to (9,6), LEFT to (8,7)-body, RIGHT off-board. Potentially limiting.\n   - **UP to (8,9)**: Next turn safe moves? UP off-board (unsafe), DOWN to (8,8) \u2013 will be empty if I move away? Actually, if I move UP, my head leaves (8,8), and my body follows? The cell (8,8) becomes my neck. Next turn, moving DOWN to (8,8) would be moving into my own body. So from (8,9), safe moves would be LEFT to (7,9) and RIGHT to (9,9). Two safe options.\n   - **LEFT to (7,8)**: Next turn safe moves? UP to (7,9) \u2013 empty, DOWN to (7,7) \u2013 empty, LEFT to (6,8) \u2013 empty, RIGHT to (8,8) \u2013 will be my neck (since I moved LEFT, my body follows, so (8,8) becomes part of my body). So three safe options (UP, DOWN, LEFT).\n\n3. **Enemy threat:** Snake #1 head at (1,3) is far away. Its possible moves: UP to (1,4) \u2013 empty, DOWN to (1,2) \u2013 its own body, LEFT to (0,3) \u2013 empty, RIGHT to (2,3) \u2013 its own body. So it likely moves UP or LEFT. No immediate threat to my considered cells.\n\n4. **Head-on collision risk:** Could enemy snake #1 reach (9,8), (8,9), or (7,8) this turn? No, it's too far.\n\n**Decision reasoning:**\n\nRIGHT to (9,8) eats an apple immediately, increasing my score to 11 vs enemy's 12. However, it reduces my future mobility significantly next turn (only two safe moves, and one leads to a potentially tight corner). Eating now is tempting, but getting trapped could be dangerous later.\n\nLEFT to (7,8) gives me three safe options next turn and keeps me in open space. It doesn't eat an apple this turn, but maintains flexibility to target apples later.\n\nUP to (8,9) gives only two safe options next turn and pushes me toward the top edge.\n\nGiven the rules emphasize survival and keeping future options open, **LEFT** seems the safest and most flexible choice. It avoids the potential trap of the top-right corner after eating the apple at (9,8). I can still target that apple later from a better angle (e.g., from (7,8) I could go UP then RIGHT, or from (7,9) go RIGHT to (8,9) then RIGHT to (9,9) and down to the apple). Also, with enemy snake #1 having more apples, I need to play the long game and ensure I don't get trapped.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:**  \nMove LEFT to (7,8) to maintain central mobility. Next turn, assess safe moves from there, likely heading toward the apple cluster at (8,2) or (9,2) via a safe route. Monitor enemy movement\u2014it may be heading toward apples on left side (1,5) or (2,0). Avoid moving into confined spaces.\n\nLEFT",

UP also helps keep options open by moving along the apple-rich vertical line.\n- The enemy snake #0 is distant (head at (7,8)); nothing indicates an imminent head-on collision with you this turn.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Prioritize eating the near apple at (1,5) to grow safely while maintaining multiple escape routes.\n- After securing that apple, monitor enemy head movements and target other accessible apples (e.g., (2,0) or (9,2)) only if there\u2019s a clear, safe path; avoid getting boxed into corners or crossing your own body.\n- Maintain awareness of your own growing length to avoid creating tight traps; prefer moves that keep lanes open for maneuvering.\n\nChosen move: UP",

Next turn, assess safe moves from there. Consider heading toward apple at (1,5) via a safe route, but monitor enemy #1 which may target that apple.

Actually from (4,8) to (3,9): \u0394x=-1, \u0394y=+1.  \n  UP: \u0394y=+1 (good), \u0394x=0 (not moving horizontally).  \n  LEFT: \u0394x=-1 (good), \u0394y=0.  \n  So both UP and LEFT reduce Manhattan distance by 1. DOWN increases distance.\n\n**Future move safety from each option:**  \nFrom (4,9):\n  - UP: off board (death)\n  - DOWN: back to (4,8) \u2013 but that\u2019s currently my neck, will it be empty next turn? After I move, my body will shift: head moves to (4,9), body[0] becomes (4,8), body[1] becomes (5,8), etc. So (4,8) will be occupied by my own body next turn, so moving DOWN from (4,9) next turn would kill me unless I grow by eating an apple.\n  - LEFT: to (3,9) \u2013 that\u2019s an apple, so if I go UP now and LEFT next, I eat apple at (3,9).\n  - RIGHT: to (5,9) \u2013 empty now, but need to check future safety later.\n\nFrom (3,8):\n  - UP: to (3,9) apple \u2013 good.\n  - DOWN: to (3,7) empty.\n  - LEFT: to (2,8) empty.\n  - RIGHT: back to (4,8) \u2013 will be my neck (occupied next turn).\n\nFrom (4,7):\n  - UP: back to (4,8) neck (occupied next turn).\n  - DOWN: to (4,6) empty.\n  - LEFT: to (3,7) empty.\n  - RIGHT: to (5,7) empty.\n\nSo UP now gives me only LEFT as a safe follow-up next turn if I want to avoid suicide (since DOWN and RIGHT lead to possibly occupied cells unless I grow). Actually RIGHT from (4,9) goes to (5,9) which is empty now and likely safe unless enemy moves there.\n\nLEFT now gives me UP, DOWN, LEFT as safe next moves from (3,8) \u2013 that\u2019s three options.\n\nDOWN now gives me DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT from (4,7) \u2013 three options but moves me away from closest apple.\n\n**Enemy snake #1 at (1,7):**  \nIts possible moves: UP (1,8), DOWN (1,6), LEFT (0,7), RIGHT (2,7).  \nAll except possibly RIGHT (2,7) are safe for it? Checking board: (1,8) empty, (1,6) its body? Wait its body: [(1,6), (1,5), ...] so (1,6) is its own body segment, so DOWN would kill it. So enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \nIt might aim for apple at (3,9) via path: (1,7)\u2192(2,7)\u2192(3,7)\u2192(4,7)\u2192(4,8)\u2192(4,9)\u2192(3,9) or similar. But it\u2019s far.\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**  \nIf I move LEFT to (3,8), could enemy move RIGHT from (1,7) to (2,7) \u2013 no collision. If enemy moves RIGHT twice then UP etc., no immediate clash.\n\nIf I move UP to (4,9), enemy would need many moves to reach me.\n\nGiven that LEFT offers more follow-up options and moves toward apple (3,9) equally as UP, but UP limits next moves more, I prefer LEFT.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove LEFT to (3,8) this turn. Next turn, if apple at (3,9) still there and safe, move UP to eat it. If not safe (enemy might move to (2,8) or (3,8) itself?), assess then. Keep options open.\n\nLEFT",

Moving here would eat it, grow by 1, and score an 11th apple.  \nIs it safe?  \n- Not off-board.  \n- Not my own body (my body is at [(4,8), (5,8), \u2026]).  \n- Not enemy body (enemy body doesn\u2019t include (3,9)).  \n- No head-on collision risk? Enemy head is at (1,8). Its possible moves: UP (1,9), DOWN (1,7), LEFT (0,8), RIGHT (2,8). It cannot reach (3,9) this turn. So no immediate collision.  \n\u2705 Safe.\n\n**DOWN to (3,7)** \u2013 Empty cell. Safe from board/self/enemy body. Enemy could move RIGHT to (2,8) or elsewhere, but (3,7) not in its reach. \u2705 Safe.\n\n**LEFT to (2,8)** \u2013 Empty cell. Safe from board/self/enemy body. Enemy could move RIGHT to (2,8)?? Wait, enemy at (1,8) moving RIGHT would go to (2,8). That would be a head-on collision if I also move to (2,8). So **LEFT risks head-on collision** if enemy chooses RIGHT. \u274c Risky.\n\n**RIGHT to (4,8)** \u2013 That\u2019s my own body (second segment). Moving into myself. \u274c Suicide.\n\nSo **RIGHT** is eliminated, **LEFT** is risky due to potential head-on collision with enemy moving RIGHT.  \nRemaining safe moves: **UP** and **DOWN**.\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nApples at: (2,0), (9,2), (8,2), (9,8), (3,9).  \nClosest to (3,8) is (3,9) \u2013 distance 1. UP eats it immediately.  \nDOWN moves away from closest apple.\n\n**Future safety after each safe move:**  \nIf I go **UP to (3,9)** and eat apple, I grow by 1. My body becomes: head (3,9), then (3,8) (new segment), then (4,8), (5,8), \u2026 tail at (7,4).  \nNext turn from (3,9):  \n- UP to (3,10) off-board \u274c  \n- DOWN to (3,8) \u2013 will be my own new body segment \u274c  \n- LEFT to (2,9) \u2013 empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT to (4,9) \u2013 empty \u2705  \nSo I\u2019d have two safe moves next turn.\n\nIf I go **DOWN to (3,7)**:  \nNext turn from (3,7):  \n- UP to (3,8) \u2013 will be my neck if I don\u2019t grow? Wait, if I move DOWN, my body shifts: head to (3,7), neck to (3,8) (old head), then (4,8), etc. So (3,8) will be my body next turn, so UP from (3,7) would be suicide unless I grow.  \n- DOWN to (3,6) \u2013 empty \u2705  \n- LEFT to (2,7) \u2013 empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT to (4,7) \u2013 empty \u2705  \nSo three safe moves if I don\u2019t grow, but moving DOWN avoids apple, so no growth.\n\n**Enemy behavior:**  \nEnemy head at (1,8). It might aim for apple at (3,9) via (2,8) then (3,8) then (3,9). If I go UP, I take that apple before it can. If I go DOWN, I leave apple for enemy.  \nEnemy\u2019s safe moves: UP (1,9), DOWN (1,7) \u2013 but (1,7) is its own body? Actually its body: [(1,7), (1,6), \u2026] so DOWN is suicide. LEFT (0,8), RIGHT (2,8). So enemy likely chooses UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. RIGHT brings it to (2,8), closer to apple.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEating apple at (3,9) now gets me to 11 apples vs enemy\u2019s 13, narrowing gap. It also denies enemy that apple.  \nUP is safe and advances my score.  \nDOWN is safe but doesn\u2019t help score and might trap me later with fewer options next turn (since UP from (3,7) will be blocked by my own body).\n\nGiven the risk of LEFT (head-on collision) and the benefit of UP (apple + safe), **UP** is the best.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (3,9), I\u2019ll have safe moves LEFT or RIGHT. I should assess then whether to circle toward other apples (like (9,8) or (8,2)) while avoiding enemy.\n\nUP",

Is it safe?  \n- On board: Yes.  \n- My own body: No, my body is at [(3,8), (4,8), ...].  \n- Enemy body: Enemy body does not include (2,9).  \n- Head-on collision risk: Enemy head is at (1,9). Its possible moves: UP (1,10) off-board \u274c, DOWN (1,8) empty \u2705, LEFT (0,9) empty \u2705, RIGHT (2,9) empty \u2705. If enemy moves RIGHT to (2,9) the same turn I move LEFT to (2,9), that's a head-on collision\u2014both die. That's risky.  \n\n**RIGHT to (4,9)** \u2013 Empty cell (board shows '.' at (4,9)). Is it safe?  \n- On board: Yes.  \n- My own body: No.  \n- Enemy body: No.  \n- Head-on collision risk: Enemy at (1,9) cannot reach (4,9) in one move. \u2705 Safe.\n\nSo **UP** and **DOWN** are immediately fatal. **LEFT** risks head-on collision if enemy chooses RIGHT. **RIGHT** is safe.\n\nNow, among safe moves, only **RIGHT** is available (LEFT is unsafe due to potential simultaneous collision). So I must choose RIGHT.\n\n**Future safety after RIGHT:**  \nMoving to (4,9) gives me a new head position. My body will shift: head to (4,9), then (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), ... tail at (7,4).  \nNext turn from (4,9):  \n- UP to (4,10) off-board \u274c  \n- DOWN to (4,8) \u2013 that will be my own body (the segment that was at (3,8) shifts to (4,8)? Let's trace: current body: [(3,8), (4,8), (5,8), ...]. After move RIGHT, new body: head (4,9), then (3,9), then (3,8), then (4,8)... So DOWN to (4,8) would hit my own body segment. \u274c  \n- LEFT to (3,9) \u2013 will be my own body (the second segment). \u274c  \n- RIGHT to (5,9) \u2013 empty \u2705  \n\nSo only **RIGHT** would be safe next turn from (4,9). That's a potential trap (only one safe move). But I have no other safe option this turn.\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nApples at: (2,0), (9,2), (8,2), (9,8), (7,6).  \nFrom (4,9), the closest apple is (9,8) (distance 5) or (7,6) (distance ~3.6). RIGHT moves me toward the right side, closer to (9,8) and (7,6) eventually.\n\n**Enemy behavior:**  \nEnemy head at (1,9). Its safe moves: DOWN to (1,8) (empty), LEFT to (0,9) (empty), RIGHT to (2,9) (empty). UP is off-board. It might go for apple at (9,8) via a path, or maybe down toward (2,0). If enemy moves RIGHT to (2,9), we could have collided if I moved LEFT. Since I'm moving RIGHT, we avoid that.\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nI'm forced RIGHT to (4,9) this turn. Next turn, my only safe move will be RIGHT again to (5,9). That continues along the top row. I need to look for an escape route soon\u2014perhaps after (5,9) I could go DOWN to (5,8) if that cell becomes free (it will be occupied by my shifting body now, but might clear later). I must plan a path to avoid boxing myself in. Also, consider aiming for apple at (7,6) by moving down the right side later.\n\n**Final decision:**  \nOnly safe move is RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Is it safe?  \n- On board: Yes.  \n- My own body: No, my body does not include (5,9).  \n- Enemy body: Enemy body does not include (5,9).  \n- Head-on collision risk: Enemy head is at (0,9). Its possible moves: UP (0,10) off-board \u274c, DOWN (0,8) empty \u2705, LEFT (-1,9) off-board \u274c, RIGHT (1,9) its own body \u274c. So enemy's only safe move is DOWN to (0,8). It cannot reach (5,9) in one move. \u2705 Safe.\n\nSo **UP, DOWN, LEFT** are immediately fatal. **RIGHT** is safe.\n\nNow, among safe moves, only **RIGHT** is available.\n\n**Future safety after RIGHT:**  \nMoving to (5,9) gives me a new head position. My body will shift: head to (5,9), then (4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), ... tail at (8,4).  \nNext turn from (5,9):  \n- UP to (5,10) off-board \u274c  \n- DOWN to (5,8) \u2013 that will be my own body (the segment that was at (4,8) shifts to (5,8)? Let's trace: current body after move: [(4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), ...]. So DOWN to (5,8) would hit my own body. \u274c  \n- LEFT to (4,9) \u2013 my own body (the second segment). \u274c  \n- RIGHT to (6,9) \u2013 empty \u2705  \n\nSo again, only **RIGHT** would be safe next turn from (5,9). That's a corridor along the top row.\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nApples at: (2,0), (9,2), (8,2), (9,8), (7,6).  \nFrom (5,9), moving RIGHT continues toward apples on the right side: (9,8) and (7,6) are closer horizontally. The apple at (9,8) is 4 cells away rightwards, but I'll need to go down eventually.\n\n**Enemy behavior:**  \nEnemy head at (0,9). Its only safe move is DOWN to (0,8). It will move away from the top row, reducing collision risk.\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nI'm forced RIGHT to (5,9) this turn, and likely RIGHT again to (6,9) next turn. I'm moving along the top row. I need to plan an escape downward before I hit the wall at (9,9). After (6,9), I could consider DOWN to (6,8) if that cell becomes free\u2014it's currently occupied by my body segment at (6,8), but that segment will shift as I move. Let's simulate:  \nCurrent body after this move: [(4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4)]  \nAfter next move RIGHT to (6,9), body becomes: [(5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]  \nSo (6,8) remains occupied by my body at that time. So DOWN from (6,9) to (6,8) would be suicide.  \nTherefore, I'll likely be forced to continue RIGHT along the top until (9,9), then my only move would be DOWN to (9,8)\u2014but (9,8) has an apple, so that's good. However, I must ensure that when I reach (9,9), the cell (9,8) is not occupied by my own body by then. It might be clear if my tail has moved. Let's check: my tail is currently at (8,4) and will move slowly. By the time I reach (9,9) in 4 turns, my tail will have moved, but my body will fill other cells. I need to compute carefully, but for now, the only safe move is RIGHT.\n\n**Final decision:**  \nOnly safe move is RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Is it safe?  \n- On board: Yes.  \n- My own body: No, my body does not include (6,9).  \n- Enemy body: Enemy body does not include (6,9).  \n- Head-on collision risk: Enemy head is at (0,8). Its possible moves: UP (0,9) its own body \u274c, DOWN (0,7) empty \u2705, LEFT (-1,8) off-board \u274c, RIGHT (1,8) empty \u2705. So enemy has two safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.

I'm being forced along the top row.\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nI'm trapped moving right along the top row. My only hope is that when I reach (9,9), the cell below (9,8) becomes free. Currently (9,8) has an apple, but my body will occupy (8,8) and (7,8) as I move. Let's simulate:  \n- Turn 60: Move RIGHT to (6,9). Body: [(5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5)]  \n- Turn 61: Move RIGHT to (7,9). Body: [(6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)]  \n- Turn 62: Move RIGHT to (8,9). Body: [(7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7)]  \n- Turn 63: Move RIGHT to (9,9). Body: [(8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8)]  \nAt that point, (9,8) is occupied by my body segment at (8,8) which hasn't moved yet? Wait, at turn 63, (8,8) is the 12th segment (tail). Actually, my tail started at (8,5) and will move slowly. By turn 63, the tail should have moved to (8,4)? Let's trace more carefully: my tail is currently at (8,5). After each move, the tail moves forward one cell along the body path. Since I'm moving right, the tail will move along the path: (8,5) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (8,7) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (8,9)? That seems wrong because the tail follows the body. Actually, when I move right, I remove the last segment (tail) and add a new head. So the tail shifts along the body. Given my long body, the tail will stay in the lower right area for a while. By turn 63, the tail might be at (8,8) or (8,9). If the tail is at (8,8) when I'm at (9,9), then (9,8) might be free? Not necessarily, because the segment before the tail is at (7,8). This is getting complex, but the key is that I have no choice now.\n\n**Enemy behavior:**  \nEnemy head at (0,8). It will likely move DOWN or RIGHT to avoid its own body. It's far away and not an immediate threat.\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nApples at (9,8) and (7,6) are on the right side. Moving right keeps me closer to them horizontally, though I need to go down eventually.\n\nGiven the analysis, my only safe move is RIGHT. I must continue along the top row and hope for an escape downward later when my tail moves out of the way.\n\nRIGHT",

Is it safe?\n- On board: Yes.\n- My own body: No, my body does not include (7,9).\n- Enemy body: Enemy body does not include (7,9).\n- Head-on collision risk: Enemy head is at (0,7). Its possible moves: UP (0,8) its own body \u274c, DOWN (0,6) empty \u2705, LEFT (-1,7) off-board \u274c, RIGHT (1,7) empty \u2705. Enemy cannot reach (7,9) in one move. \u2705 Safe.\n\nSo again, **UP, DOWN, LEFT** are immediately fatal. **RIGHT** is the only safe move.\n\n**Future safety after RIGHT:**\nMoving to (7,9) continues me along the top row. Next turn from (7,9), my options will be:\n- UP to (7,10) off-board \u274c\n- DOWN to (7,8) \u2013 that will be my own body (currently at (7,8), and after moving my body shifts, but (7,8) remains occupied by my body). \u274c\n- LEFT to (6,9) \u2013 my own body (the new second segment). \u274c\n- RIGHT to (8,9) \u2013 empty \u2705\n\nSo again, only RIGHT will be safe next turn. I'm forced along the top row.\n\n**Long-term plan note:**\nI'm trapped moving right along the top row until I reach (9,9). My tail is currently at (8,6). As I move right, my tail will gradually move north along the right side. By the time I reach (9,9), my tail might have cleared (9,8) or (8,8), potentially allowing me to go DOWN from (9,9) to (9,8) if that cell becomes empty. However, there's an apple at (9,8) currently. If I eat it, I'll grow by one, which could complicate my escape by keeping my tail in place longer. But I have no choice but to continue right for now.\n\n**Enemy behavior:**\nEnemy head at (0,7). It will likely move DOWN to (0,6) or RIGHT to (1,7) to avoid its body. It's far away and not an immediate threat.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\nApples at (9,8) and (7,6) are on the right side. Moving right keeps me horizontally aligned with (9,8), though I can't reach it yet.\n\nGiven the analysis, my only safe move is RIGHT. I must continue along the top row and hope for an escape downward later when my tail moves out of the way.\n\nRIGHT",

That apple at (9,8) is valuable to close the apple gap (11 vs 13). After eating, I'll need to plan an escape from the corner\u2014possibly continue DOWN to (9,7) if safe, or LEFT to (8,8) if cleared by then. Meanwhile, enemy snake #1 is long and may become trapped in its own coils; I should focus on survival and apple collection while avoiding its possible expansion toward center.\n\nRIGHT",

Check each direction for immediate death:**  \n\n- **UP** \u2192 (8,8): Currently empty (`.`) on board. Not my body, not enemy body. Safe.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8,6): Currently empty (`.`) on board. Not my body, not enemy body. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7,7): Currently empty (`.`). Safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,7): That\u2019s my own body segment (second segment). Would die. **Eliminate RIGHT.**  \n\nAll but RIGHT are safe from immediate self-collision or board edge.  \n\n---\n\n**2. Consider enemy snake\u2019s possible moves:**  \n\nEnemy head at (1,2), body extends upward along column 1 and across row 0.  \nEnemy\u2019s safe moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (1,3): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1,1): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0,2): its own body? Wait, enemy body list: [(0,2), (0,3), \u2026]. Yes, (0,2) is its second segment \u2192 would die. So LEFT not safe for enemy.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,2): empty.  \n\nSo enemy could move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.  \n\nCould enemy move into a cell I\u2019m considering?  \nMy candidate moves: (8,8), (8,6), (7,7). Enemy is far away at (1,2), so no direct collision possible this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Head-on collision risk?**  \nEnemy is too far to reach my candidate cells in one move. So no simultaneous head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n\n- **UP to (8,8):**  \n  Next turn from (8,8), possible moves: UP to (8,9) \u2192 occupied by my body segment (tail region). Not safe.  \n  DOWN to (8,7) \u2192 currently my head\u2019s current position, but after I move, it will be empty unless my tail moves there. My tail is at (5,8) now, will move to (4,8) next turn if I don\u2019t grow. So (8,7) will be empty next turn. So DOWN safe.  \n  LEFT to (7,8) \u2192 empty now, likely safe next turn unless enemy moves there (unlikely).  \n  RIGHT to (9,8) \u2192 my body segment (currently at (9,8)), but that segment will move to (9,7) next turn? Wait, my body: head (8,7), then (9,7), (9,8), \u2026 Actually if I move UP, my whole body shifts: head to (8,8), segment 2 (currently at 9,7) moves to old head (8,7), segment 3 (9,8) moves to (9,7), etc. So (9,8) becomes empty next turn? Let\u2019s trace: current body:  \n  (8,7)H, (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), \u2026  \n  If I move UP to (8,8): new head (8,8), segment 2 becomes old head (8,7), segment 3 becomes (9,7), segment 4 becomes (9,8), segment 5 becomes (9,9), etc. So (9,8) is occupied by segment 4 next turn. So RIGHT from (8,8) goes to (9,8) which will be my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n  So from (8,8), safe next moves: DOWN, LEFT only.  \n\n- **DOWN to (8,6):**  \n  Next turn from (8,6):  \n  UP to (8,7) \u2192 empty (old head, tail far).  \n  DOWN to (8,5) \u2192 empty.  \n  LEFT to (7,6) \u2192 apple now, but could be eaten by me or enemy? Actually if I move DOWN now, I don\u2019t eat apple at (7,6) yet. Next turn LEFT from (8,6) to (7,6) would eat apple then.  \n  RIGHT to (9,6) \u2192 empty.  \n  All four directions possibly safe unless enemy moves into them. So DOWN gives good mobility.  \n\n- **LEFT to (7,7):**  \n  Next turn from (7,7):  \n  UP to (7,8) \u2192 empty.  \n  DOWN to (7,6) \u2192 apple, safe unless enemy gets there same time (enemy far).  \n  LEFT to (6,7) \u2192 empty.  \n  RIGHT to (8,7) \u2192 empty (old head position).  \n  All four seem safe next turn. Good mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Apple proximity:**  \n\nClosest apples: (7,6) is 2 moves away if I go DOWN then LEFT.  \n(8,2) and (9,2) are farther. (2,0) very far. (8,0) far.  \n\nDOWN puts me closer to (7,6). LEFT puts me equally close in Manhattan distance but requires DOWN next turn anyway.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019m behind in apples (12 vs 14). Need to collect apples faster while staying safe. The apple at (7,6) is reachable soon. Also, enemy is on other side of board, so I have time. Avoid trapping myself in top-right corner. My current body wraps along top and right edges; moving DOWN opens space.  \n\nBest move for future options and apple path: **DOWN** \u2192 (8,6).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,6), consider moving LEFT to (7,6) to eat apple if safe, but check enemy\u2019s possible moves then. If enemy could reach (7,6) same turn (unlikely unless it moves many steps), maybe go DOWN/UP to avoid head-on. Prioritize keeping mobility toward center board.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Check each direction for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (8,7): That's my own body segment (second segment). Would die. \u274c  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8,5): Empty (`.`). Safe. \u2705  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7,6): Apple at (7,6). Not occupied by any snake body. Safe. \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,6): Empty (`.`). Safe. \u2705  \n\nSo UP is eliminated.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy snake\u2019s possible moves and collision risk:\n\nEnemy head at (2,2), body: [(1,2), (0,2), (0,3), ...].  \nEnemy\u2019s safe moves:  \n- UP to (2,3): empty.  \n- DOWN to (2,1): empty.  \n- LEFT to (1,2): its own body segment \u2192 would die. \u274c  \n- RIGHT to (3,2): empty.  \n\nSo enemy can move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nCould enemy reach any of my candidate cells this turn?  \nMy candidates: (8,5), (7,6), (9,6).  \nEnemy is at (2,2), Manhattan distances:  \n- To (8,5): |8-2|+|5-2| = 6+3 = 9 \u2192 impossible in one move.  \n- To (7,6): |7-2|+|6-2| = 5+4 = 9 \u2192 impossible.  \n- To (9,6): |9-2|+|6-2| = 7+4 = 11 \u2192 impossible.  \n\nSo no direct collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple proximity and growth opportunity:\n\n- **LEFT (7,6)** \u2192 lands directly on apple. Immediate growth (+1 apple).  \n- **DOWN (8,5)** \u2192 moves toward bottom-left apples (2,0) and (8,0), but farther from immediate apple.  \n- **RIGHT (9,6)** \u2192 moves toward right edge, away from most apples.\n\nEating an apple now puts me at 13 apples vs enemy\u2019s 14, narrowing the gap. Also, growth extends my tail, which can be useful for blocking later but also increases risk of self-entrapment if not careful.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility after each safe move:\n\n- **LEFT to (7,6)** \u2013 after eating apple, my body grows by 1 segment. New head at (7,6), body adds segment at old tail? Actually growth means tail doesn\u2019t move this turn, so my length increases by 1. Next turn from (7,6):  \n  - UP to (7,7): empty now, likely safe.  \n  - DOWN to (7,5): empty.  \n  - LEFT to (6,6): empty.  \n  - RIGHT to (8,6): empty (old head position).  \n  All four directions likely safe unless enemy moves into them (enemy far). Good mobility.\n\n- **DOWN to (8,5)** \u2013 no growth this turn. Next turn from (8,5):  \n  - UP to (8,6): empty (old head).  \n  - DOWN to (8,4): empty.  \n  - LEFT to (7,5): empty.  \n  - RIGHT to (9,5): empty.  \n  Good mobility, keeps options open.\n\n- **RIGHT to (9,6)** \u2013 no growth. Next turn from (9,6):  \n  - UP to (9,7): currently my body segment, but after move, segment at (9,7) shifts to (8,7)? Let\u2019s check: moving RIGHT from (8,6) to (9,6), body shifts: head to (9,6), segment 2 becomes (8,6), segment 3 becomes (8,7), segment 4 becomes (9,7), etc. So (9,7) will be occupied by my body next turn \u2192 UP unsafe.  \n  - DOWN to (9,5): empty.  \n  - LEFT to (8,6): empty (old head).  \n  - RIGHT off board \u2192 death. \u274c  \n  So only DOWN and LEFT safe next turn. Restricted.\n\nRIGHT leads to edge and reduces future options.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Risk of head-on collision next turn if I eat apple:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7,6) and eat apple, enemy might move toward (7,6) next turn? Enemy at (2,2) could move RIGHT to (3,2), then need 4 more moves to reach (7,6) \u2014 not an immediate threat. Low risk.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Long-term strategy:\n\nI\u2019m behind 12 vs 14 apples. Eating an apple now is crucial to catch up. The apple at (7,6) is safe to take this turn.  \nLEFT gives immediate apple, good mobility afterward, and doesn\u2019t trap me.  \nDOWN is safe but delays eating.  \nRIGHT is risky due to board edge and reduced future moves.\n\nBest choice: **LEFT** to eat apple and grow.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (7,6), my head will be at (7,6), length 13. Enemy likely still far. Next turn prioritize safety and movement toward another apple\u2014maybe (8,0) or (2,0). Avoid moving into my own elongated body. Keep options open, maybe move DOWN to (7,5) to open space.\n\nLEFT",

Safe. \u2705\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8,6): My own body segment (second segment in my current body list). Would die. \u274c\n\nSo RIGHT is eliminated.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy snake\u2019s possible moves and collision risk:\n\nEnemy head at (3,2), body: [(2,2), (1,2), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6)].\nEnemy\u2019s safe moves:\n- UP to (3,3): Empty.\n- DOWN to (3,1): Empty.\n- LEFT to (2,2): Its own body segment \u2192 would die. \u274c\n- RIGHT to (4,2): Empty.\n\nSo enemy can move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nCould enemy reach any of my candidate cells this turn?\nMy candidates: (7,7), (7,5), (6,6).\nEnemy is at (3,2), Manhattan distances:\n- To (7,7): |7-3|+|7-2| = 4+5 = 9 \u2192 impossible in one move.\n- To (7,5): |7-3|+|5-2| = 4+3 = 7 \u2192 impossible.\n- To (6,6): |6-3|+|6-2| = 3+4 = 7 \u2192 impossible.\n\nSo no direct collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple proximity and growth opportunity:\n\nApples are at: (2,0), (9,2), (8,2), (8,0), (1,3).\n- **UP (7,7)**: Moves away from all apples. No immediate apple.\n- **DOWN (7,5)**: Moves toward bottom-left apples (2,0) and (8,0), but still several moves away.\n- **LEFT (6,6)**: Moves slightly closer to apple (8,0) and (2,0), but no immediate apple.\n\nNo apple is directly adjacent to my head this turn. Eating an apple now would put me at 14 apples vs enemy's 14, tying the score. Since I'm behind (13 vs 14), I should prioritize moving toward an apple.\n\nClosest apples by Manhattan distance:\n- (8,0): |7-8|+|6-0| = 1+6 = 7\n- (2,0): |7-2|+|6-0| = 5+6 = 11\n- (1,3): |7-1|+|6-3| = 6+3 = 9\n- (9,2): |7-9|+|6-2| = 2+4 = 6\n- (8,2): |7-8|+|6-2| = 1+4 = 5\n\nThe closest apple is (8,2) at distance 5. To reach (8,2) from (7,6), I could go RIGHT (invalid), DOWN to (7,5), then LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT... Actually, from (7,6), the move that gets me closest to (8,2) is DOWN to (7,5) (distance to (8,2) becomes |7-8|+|5-2|=1+3=4). LEFT to (6,6) increases distance to (8,2) to |6-8|+|6-2|=2+4=6. UP to (7,7) increases distance to 1+5=6.\n\nSo DOWN is best for approaching the nearest apple (8,2).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility after each safe move:\n\n- **UP to (7,7)** \u2013 Next turn from (7,7):\n  - UP to (7,8): Empty.\n  - DOWN to (7,6): Empty (old head).\n  - LEFT to (6,7): Empty.\n  - RIGHT to (8,7): Currently my body segment (8,7) will shift? After move, my body: head (7,7), then (7,6), (8,6), (8,7)... So (8,7) will be occupied \u2192 RIGHT unsafe next turn.\n  So UP, DOWN, LEFT safe. Good mobility.\n\n- **DOWN to (7,5)** \u2013 Next turn from (7,5):\n  - UP to (7,6): Empty (old head).\n  - DOWN to (7,4): Empty.\n  - LEFT to (6,5): Empty.\n  - RIGHT to (8,5): Empty.\n  All four directions likely safe. Excellent mobility.\n\n- **LEFT to (6,6)** \u2013 Next turn from (6,6):\n  - UP to (6,7): Empty.\n  - DOWN to (6,5): Empty.\n  - LEFT to (5,6): Empty.\n  - RIGHT to (7,6): Empty (old head).\n  All four directions safe. Good mobility.\n\nAll three safe moves offer good future options. DOWN offers the best mobility (all four directions open next turn) and moves me toward the nearest apple.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Risk of head-on collision next turn:\n\nEnemy at (3,2) could move RIGHT to (4,2), then next turn possibly to (5,2), etc. It's far from my possible positions next turn (7,7), (7,5), (6,6). Low immediate risk.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Long-term strategy:\n\nI'm behind 13 to 14 apples. Need to catch up. The apple at (8,2) is closest. Moving DOWN gets me closer to it while maintaining maximum mobility. UP moves away from apples. LEFT moves me slightly toward left-side apples but not as efficiently as DOWN for (8,2).\n\nGiven the board layout, my long body along the top and right edges means I should avoid trapping myself in the upper-right area. Moving DOWN opens space toward the center and bottom, where apples are located.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nMove DOWN to (7,5). Next turn, assess: if apple (8,2) is still there, consider moving RIGHT to (8,5) or DOWN to (7,4) to approach it. Keep an eye on enemy movement. Avoid moving into my own body as it shifts.\n\nDOWN",

Risk of trapping / enemy approach:\n\nEnemy at (4,2) could move RIGHT to (5,2), then (6,2), (7,2)... but that\u2019s several turns away. My body occupies top and right edges, so moving RIGHT puts me closer to my own body cluster. Moving DOWN opens central area.\n\nGiven I\u2019m behind in apples, I should prioritize both safety and apple access. DOWN gets me closer to apple (8,2) and keeps maximum mobility. RIGHT also gets closer but reduces future mobility (blocks UP next turn).\n\n---\n\n### 6. Long-term plan for next few turns:\n\nFrom (7,4) next turn, I can aim for apple (8,2) by moving RIGHT to (8,4) then UP, or DOWN to (7,3) then RIGHT. Need to monitor enemy movement\u2014they might head toward (8,2) as well. Avoid getting pinched by my own long body along the top.\n\n**Priority:** Catch up on apples, stay alive, keep options open.\n\nDOWN",

Immediate safety check (possible moves from (8,4)):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (8,5): Empty (`.`). Safe. \u2705\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8,3): Empty (`.`). Safe. \u2705\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7,4): My own body (first segment). \u274c **DEATH**.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,4): Empty (`.`). Safe. \u2705\n\nLEFT is lethal.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy collision risk this turn:\n\nEnemy head at (6,2). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (6,3): Empty.\n- DOWN to (6,1): Empty.\n- LEFT to (5,2): Its own body (second segment) \u2192 \u274c\n- RIGHT to (7,2): Empty.\n\nSo enemy can move UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nMy candidate cells: (8,5), (8,3), (9,4).  \nManhattan distances from enemy head (6,2):\n- To (8,5): |8-6|+|5-2| = 2+3 = 5 \u2192 impossible in 1 move.\n- To (8,3): |8-6|+|3-2| = 2+1 = 3 \u2192 possible.\n- To (9,4): |9-6|+|4-2| = 3+2 = 5 \u2192 impossible in 1 move.\n\nSo (8,5) and (9,4) are safest from immediate enemy collision. (8,3) is within enemy's 3-step reach.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple proximity and score:\n\nI have 13 apples, enemy has 14. Need to catch up.\n\nClosest apple distances from my head (8,4):\n- (8,2): |8-8|+|4-2| = 0+2 = 2\n- (9,2): |8-9|+|4-2| = 1+2 = 3\n- (8,0): |8-8|+|4-0| = 0+4 = 4\n- (1,3): |8-1|+|4-3| = 7+1 = 8\n- (2,0): |8-2|+|4-0| = 6+4 = 10\n\nClosest is (8,2) at distance 2.\n\nWhich move gets me closer to (8,2)?\n- UP to (8,5): new distance = |8-8|+|5-2| = 0+3 = 3 \u274c farther\n- DOWN to (8,3): new distance = |8-8|+|3-2| = 0+1 = 1 \u2705 **closer**\n- RIGHT to (9,4): new distance = |9-8|+|4-2| = 1+2 = 3 \u274c farther\n\nDOWN is the only move that brings me closer to the nearest apple (8,2).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility after safe moves:\n\n- **UP to (8,5)** \u2013 Next turn from (8,5):\n  - UP to (8,6): My body (segment 4) \u2192 \u274c\n  - DOWN to (8,4): empty (old head).\n  - LEFT to (7,5): My body (segment 2) \u2192 \u274c\n  - RIGHT to (9,5): empty.\n  Only 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT). Poor.\n\n- **DOWN to (8,3)** \u2013 Next turn from (8,3):\n  - UP to (8,4): empty (old head).\n  - DOWN to (8,2): apple (A).\n  - LEFT to (7,3): empty.\n  - RIGHT to (9,3): empty.\n  All four directions open. Excellent.\n\n- **RIGHT to (9,4)** \u2013 Next turn from (9,4):\n  - UP to (9,5): empty.\n  - DOWN to (9,3): empty.\n  - LEFT to (8,4): empty (old head).\n  - RIGHT to (10,4): off board \u2192 \u274c\n  Only 3 safe moves. Good.\n\nDOWN offers the best future mobility (4 options). UP is restrictive due to my body above.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Risk assessment:\n\nEnemy is at (6,2). If it moves RIGHT to (7,2), it could threaten (8,3) next turn (distance 2). However, (8,3) is still safe this turn. My priority should be to grab the apple at (8,2) quickly to catch up in score. From (8,3), I can go DOWN to (8,2) next turn to eat it.\n\nGiven that enemy is 3 steps away from (8,3) this turn, and we move simultaneously, I should be safe moving DOWN. Even if enemy moves RIGHT to (7,2), it cannot reach (8,3) this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Long-term plan for next few turns:\n\nFrom (8,3), aim to eat apple (8,2) next turn via DOWN. After eating, consider moving toward (9,2) or (8,0) for additional apples. Monitor enemy movement\u2014they might head toward (9,2) as well. Avoid moving back into my body cluster in the top-right. Keep options open toward center-left where apples ((1,3), (2,0)) are located later.\n\n**Priority:** Grab closest apple (8,2) safely while maintaining mobility.\n\nDOWN",

DOWN eats apple now but could be contested if enemy moves RIGHT to (8,2) this turn\u2014head-on collision kills both.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Risk assessment:\n\n**Critical:** If I move DOWN to (8,2) and enemy moves RIGHT to (8,2) simultaneously, we have a head-on collision \u2192 both die. Enemy can move RIGHT, so this is a real risk.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7,3) and enemy moves UP to (7,3), same head-on collision risk.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,3), enemy cannot reach (9,3) in one move (distance 3). Safest.\n\nGiven enemy's options (UP, DOWN, RIGHT), moving RIGHT avoids any possible head-on collision this turn. Moving DOWN or LEFT risks immediate death if enemy chooses the same cell.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Long-term plan for next few turns:\n\nFrom (9,3), next turn I can go DOWN to (9,2) to eat that apple, unless enemy takes it first. Enemy might head toward (9,2) via (8,2) or (7,3)\u2192(8,2)? But if enemy goes to (8,2) this turn, I can't go there anyway. Better to stay safe, grab (9,2) next turn, then consider (8,0) or others. Keep avoiding my long body wrapping the top-right corner.\n\n**Priority:** Avoid head-on collision this turn. Secure (9,2) apple next turn safely.\n\nRIGHT",

No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple proximity and score:\n\nI have 13 apples, enemy has 14.

Worse mobility.\n\nDOWN gives better mobility and eats an apple now.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Long-term plan:\n\nFrom (9,2) after eating, I\u2019ll be at 14 apples (tying enemy). Next turn I can consider (8,2) apple if safe, or head toward (8,0). My long body wraps around top-right, so I should avoid trapping myself. Enemy is on left side, likely heading toward apples (1,3) or (2,0). I should secure apples on my right side first.\n\n**Priority:** Eat closest apple safely, maintain mobility.\n\n---\n\n**Final move:** DOWN",

Future mobility after safe moves:\n\n**LEFT to (8,2) with growth:**  \nNext turn from (8,2):  \n- UP (8,3): my body \u274c  \n- DOWN (8,1): likely empty (but enemy from (8,0) could move there)  \n- LEFT (7,2): enemy body \u274c  \n- RIGHT (9,2): my body \u274c  \nOnly DOWN may be safe, but risk of enemy moving to (8,1) if enemy is at (8,0).\n\n**DOWN to (9,1) without growth:**  \nNext turn from (9,1):  \n- UP (9,2): my body \u274c  \n- DOWN (9,0): empty (but enemy could move to (9,0))  \n- LEFT (8,1): empty (but enemy could move to (8,1))  \n- RIGHT: off-board \u274c  \nTwo safe moves (DOWN, LEFT), but both risk head-on collision if enemy moves accordingly.\n\nBoth options have risks next turn, but LEFT gains an apple now.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Long-term plan:\n\nAfter eating apple at (8,2), aim to move DOWN to (8,1) next turn if safe (watch enemy movement from (8,0) or (6,0)). Then consider moving toward center or apple at (5,6) by going left/down as paths open. Avoid trapping in top-right corner. Enemy likely targets (8,0) or (2,0); we hold lead and play cautiously.\n\n**Priority:** Secure apple lead, maintain survival.\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Since maximizing apples while staying safe is the priority, UP is the better immediate choice.\n\n- Plan: Prioritize eating nearby apples when safe to grow the snake and increase your lead. After securing (8,1), look to steer toward other accessible apples (e.g., (2,0) and (1,3)) while avoiding head-on collisions with Snake #0. Keep some escape moves to avoid trapping yourself as the board tightens.\n\nUP",

Immediate safety check from (8,2):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (8,3): My body \u274c **DEATH** (my body segment at (9,3) connects, but (8,3) is also in my body list).\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8,1): Contains apple at (8,1) \u2705 (empty of snake bodies currently)\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7,2): Enemy body \u274c **DEATH** (enemy body segment at (7,2) is in enemy body list).\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,2): My body \u274c **DEATH** (my body segment at (9,2)).\n\n**Safe moves:** DOWN only.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy collision risk this turn:\n\nEnemy head at (8,0). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (8,1): Contains apple, but would collide with me if I move DOWN to (8,1) \u2192 head-on collision.\n- DOWN to (8,-1): Off-board \u274c\n- LEFT to (7,0): Empty \u2705\n- RIGHT to (9,0): Empty \u2705\n\nIf enemy moves UP to (8,1) and I move DOWN to (8,1), we collide and both die.  \nIf enemy moves LEFT or RIGHT, no collision.\n\nSince I only have DOWN as a safe move, I must risk the potential head-on collision. However, the enemy might avoid UP because moving into (8,1) puts it adjacent to my head at (8,2) \u2014 but I can't assume that.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple proximity:\n\nDOWN moves onto apple at (8,1) \u2192 I grow by 1 and score 16 apples, taking the lead.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility after DOWN:\n\nIf I survive (no head-on collision), my new head at (8,1), body grows to include old head (8,2) at front.\n\nFrom (8,1) next turn:\n- UP to (8,2): My new body (old head) \u274c\n- DOWN to (8,0): Enemy's current head position (could be empty if enemy moves) \u2014 risky.\n- LEFT to (7,1): Empty currently.\n- RIGHT to (9,1): Empty currently.\n\nLEFT and RIGHT likely safe if enemy not there. DOWN risky if enemy stays. UP unsafe.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Long-term plan:\n\nIf I survive this turn, I'll have 16 apples vs enemy's 15. From (8,1), I should consider moving LEFT to (7,1) or RIGHT to (9,1) to avoid enemy zone, then work toward apples at (5,6) or (4,9) via safe paths. Avoid getting trapped along bottom row. Enemy likely will target apple at (2,0) or (1,3).\n\n**Priority:** Take the apple at (8,1) to secure lead. Hope enemy chooses LEFT/RIGHT to avoid collision.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",
