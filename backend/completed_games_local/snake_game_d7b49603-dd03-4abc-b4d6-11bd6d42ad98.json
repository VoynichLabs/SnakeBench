So UP and RIGHT would be safe, DOWN into body, LEFT off board.  \n- DOWN to (1,5): next moves UP (back to (1,6) \u2013 body), DOWN (to (1,4)), LEFT (off board), RIGHT (to (2,5)). So DOWN and RIGHT safe.  \n- RIGHT to (2,6): next moves UP (to (2,7)), DOWN (to (2,5)), LEFT (to (1,6) \u2013 body), RIGHT (to (3,6)). So UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe.  \n\nRIGHT gives most future options (3 safe next moves), DOWN gives 2, UP gives 2.  \n\nApple proximity:  \nClosest apple is (2,5) (distance |2-1| + |5-6| = 1+1=2).  \nFrom (1,6):  \n- RIGHT to (2,6): distance to (2,5) becomes 1.  \n- DOWN to (1,5): distance to (2,5) becomes 1 as well.  \n- UP to (1,7): distance to (2,5) becomes 3.  \n\nSo RIGHT and DOWN both move equally closer to (2,5).  \nOther apples: (5,7) far away, (4,1), (3,1), (6,1) also far.  \n\nEnemy\u2019s position (4,4) is closer to (2,5) (distance 3) than I am currently (distance 2), but if I move RIGHT or DOWN I\u2019ll be distance 1 next turn, so I could potentially eat it before enemy reaches it.  \n\nRisk: If enemy moves toward (2,5) this turn (e.g., LEFT to (3,4) or DOWN to (4,3)), they\u2019ll be distance 2 from (2,5) next turn. If I move DOWN to (1,5), I\u2019m adjacent to (2,5) and can eat it next turn if enemy doesn\u2019t head\u2011on into (2,5) same time. If I move RIGHT to (2,6), I\u2019m also adjacent to (2,5) but from above.  \n\nBut moving DOWN puts me at (1,5) with only DOWN and RIGHT safe next turn (LEFT off board, UP into body). That\u2019s slightly more restrictive than RIGHT to (2,6) which gives 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nAlso, moving DOWN leaves my head near bottom edge (y=5), which could limit future escape if enemy approaches. RIGHT keeps me more central.  \n\nSo RIGHT seems best: same apple proximity, more future flexibility, less trapping risk.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2,6), if apple (2,5) still present and safe (no enemy heading there), consider DOWN to eat it. Otherwise, keep moving toward other apples while maintaining multiple escape routes. Avoid moving toward enemy head if they are close.  \n\nFinal move: RIGHT",

So UP, LEFT, RIGHT safe, DOWN into body.  \n- DOWN to (2,5): apple eaten \u2192 grow to length 3, body becomes [(2,6), (1,6)] after movement. Next moves from (2,5): UP (back to (2,6) \u2013 body), DOWN (to (2,4)), LEFT (to (1,5)), RIGHT (to (3,5)). So DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT safe, UP into body.  \n- RIGHT to (3,6): next moves UP (to (3,7)), DOWN (to (3,5)), LEFT (to (2,6) \u2013 body), RIGHT (to (4,6)). So UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe, LEFT into body.  \n\nApple proximity:  \nClosest apple is (2,5) \u2013 distance 1 from my head. Moving DOWN eats it immediately.  \nOther apples: (6,1), (4,1), (3,1), (5,7) are farther.  \n\nEnemy\u2019s position (3,4) is distance 2 from (2,5). If enemy moves LEFT to (2,4) this turn, they could be adjacent to (2,5) next turn. But if I eat (2,5) this turn, enemy cannot take it.  \n\nRisk: Eating (2,5) puts me at length 3, which could make maneuvering slightly harder but gives me an apple lead (2 vs 0).  \n\nLong\u2011term plan:  \nEat (2,5) now to gain advantage. After eating, avoid moving back into my own body. From (2,5) next turn, safe moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Consider moving toward other apples while keeping escape routes open. Enemy is still short, so head\u2011on risk is low.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating (2,5), assess enemy\u2019s new position. Likely move DOWN to (2,4) or LEFT to (1,5) to stay safe and approach next nearest apple (maybe (3,1) or (4,1)). Avoid moving toward enemy head unless necessary.  \n\nFinal move: DOWN",

Wait: enemy head is currently at (2,4). If I move DOWN to (2,4), enemy could move away or stay. If enemy stays (doesn\u2019t move), both heads occupy (2,4) \u2192 head\u2011on collision \u2192 both die. That\u2019s risky.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,5) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,5) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n\nSo UP is invalid (body). DOWN is risky (possible head\u2011on if enemy doesn\u2019t move). LEFT and RIGHT are safe.  \n\nEnemy possible moves from (2,4):  \nUP to (2,5) \u2013 my head currently there, but I\u2019ll move. If enemy moves UP to (2,5) and I move DOWN to (2,4), we swap positions safely.  \nDOWN to (2,3) \u2013 empty.  \nLEFT to (1,4) \u2013 empty.  \nRIGHT to (3,4) \u2013 empty.  \nAll enemy moves are safe for them this turn.  \n\nHead\u2011on risk assessment:  \nIf I move DOWN to (2,4) and enemy moves UP to (2,5), we swap, no collision.  \nIf I move DOWN to (2,4) and enemy stays still (chooses DOWN? Actually staying still isn\u2019t allowed; they must pick a direction), but they could pick DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT and leave (2,4) empty, then I move into empty cell safely.  \nThe only head\u2011on case is if enemy chooses UP and I choose DOWN \u2192 swap \u2192 safe. Wait, that\u2019s safe. Actually, head\u2011on collision only happens if both heads move into the same cell simultaneously. If enemy moves UP to (2,5) and I move DOWN to (2,4), we don\u2019t end in same cell. So no head\u2011on.  \nBut if enemy chooses DOWN to (2,3), LEFT to (1,4), or RIGHT to (3,4), then (2,4) becomes empty and I can move into it safely. So DOWN seems safe after all. Let me double\u2011check: enemy cannot stay in place; they must move one cell. So enemy will not be at (2,4) next turn regardless of their move. Therefore moving DOWN to (2,4) is safe. Yes.  \n\nSo valid moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nFuture options after each:  \n- DOWN to (2,4): next moves UP (back to (2,5) \u2013 body), DOWN (to (2,3)), LEFT (to (1,4)), RIGHT (to (3,4)). So DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT safe.  \n- LEFT to (1,5): next moves UP (to (1,6) \u2013 body), DOWN (to (1,4)), LEFT (to (0,5)), RIGHT (to (2,5) \u2013 body). So DOWN, LEFT safe, UP and RIGHT into body.  \n- RIGHT to (3,5): next moves UP (to (3,6)), DOWN (to (3,4)), LEFT (to (2,5) \u2013 body), RIGHT (to (4,5)). So UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe.  \n\nApple proximity:  \nClosest apples: (3,1) distance |3-2|+|1-5| = 1+4=5, (4,1) distance 2+4=6, (6,1) 4+4=8, (5,7) 3+2=5, (8,2) 6+3=9.  \nFrom (2,4): (3,1) distance 1+3=4, (4,1) 2+3=5.  \nFrom (1,5): (3,1) 2+4=6, (4,1) 3+4=7.  \nFrom (3,5): (5,7) 2+2=4, (3,1) 0+4=4.  \n\nEnemy is at (2,4) now but moving. If I move DOWN to (2,4), enemy will be elsewhere. Could be adjacent next turn if enemy moves UP to (2,5) and I stay at (2,4) \u2192 adjacent but not colliding.  \n\nSafety first: DOWN seems safe and opens three safe next moves. LEFT gives only two safe next moves. RIGHT gives three safe next moves.  \n\nI want to avoid boxing myself in. LEFT to (1,5) reduces future options. DOWN or RIGHT are better.  \n\nChoosing between DOWN and RIGHT:  \nDOWN to (2,4) puts me closer to apples (3,1),(4,1).  \nRIGHT to (3,5) puts me closer to (5,7).  \nEnemy is short and not a big threat yet.  \n\nI\u2019ll go DOWN to stay central and move toward lower apples.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving to (2,4), check enemy\u2019s new position. Likely move DOWN to (2,3) or LEFT/RIGHT to approach apples while keeping escape routes. Avoid moving back into my body at (2,5).  \n\nFinal move: DOWN",
