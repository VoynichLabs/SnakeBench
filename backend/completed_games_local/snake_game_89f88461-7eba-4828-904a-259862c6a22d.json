After this turn (no apple eaten), the tail will retract to (8,7) (remove last segment (8,6)). Key priorities for upcoming turns:\n1. Preserve 3+ escape routes per move to avoid trapping (critical for sustaining progress toward the (0,8) apple).\n2. Continue leftward advance along the open y=8 row toward the (0,8) apple\u2014this row has no body segments or enemy presence, minimizing maneuverability risks.\n3. Monitor Enemy Snake #1 (head (9,2)): their possible moves (9,3), (9,1), (8,2) remain distant, but track if they shift toward the (2,3) or (7,1)/(7,2) apples (no immediate threat to your upper y=8 quadrant).\n4. Avoid moving up to y=9 (only 2 follow-up escape routes) or down to y=7 (only 2 follow-up escape routes) to prevent trapping; these directions narrow future options.\n5. Prioritize moves that don\u2019t limit follow-up choices while chipping away at the (0,8) apple\u2019s distance.\n\n### Decision Process\n1. Evaluate all four directions for immediate death risks:\n   - RIGHT (6,8): Deadly (collision with own body segment (6,8)) \u2192 eliminated.\n   - UP (5,9): Safe (no body/enemy collision, on-board) but only 2 follow-up escape routes (LEFT/RIGHT; UP off-board, DOWN is new body segment) \u2192 trapping risk.\n   - DOWN (5,7): Safe (no body/enemy collision, on-board) but only 2 follow-up escape routes (LEFT/DOWN; UP is new body segment, RIGHT is own body segment (6,7)) \u2192 trapping risk.\n   - LEFT (4,8): Safe (no body/enemy collision, on-board) with 3 follow-up escape routes (UP (4,9), DOWN (4,7), LEFT (3,8); RIGHT is new body segment) \u2192 meets escape route priority.\n2. Rank safe moves by objective alignment:\n   - LEFT is the only safe move advancing toward the reachable (0,8) apple (critical for increasing score).\n   - UP/DOWN lack apple progress and create trapping risks (2 escape routes each).\n3. Head-on collision check: Enemy Snake #1\u2019s possible new head positions (9,3), (9,1), (8,2) don\u2019t overlap with any safe new head positions (5,9), (5,7), (4,8) \u2192 no immediate risk.\n\nLEFT",
