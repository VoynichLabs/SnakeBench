However, moving **DOWN** directly to (6, 7) is also very efficient for reaching (7, 7).\n- **Refinement:** Moving RIGHT to (7, 8) first allows me to scan the board one more time before committing to the downward path. It also keeps me slightly higher on the board, maintaining better access to (8, 9) if for some reason I need to pivot.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (7, 8). On the next turn, move DOWN to (7, 7) to collect the apple. This will increase my length to 3. After that, I will navigate toward (8, 9) while keeping an eye on Snake #0's progress upward.\n\nRIGHT",

We are far enough apart that there is no immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n- **Targeting:** \n  - **Apple (8, 9):** Requires moving around my own body. Since my body is at (7, 8) and (6, 8), I cannot move directly UP. To reach (8, 9), I should move RIGHT to (8, 7) and then UP.\n  - **Apple (9, 5):** Close and located in an open area.\n  - **Apple (4, 5):** Centrally located.\n\n**Strategy for this turn:**\nMoving RIGHT to (8, 7) is the most flexible move. It gets me out from under my segment at (7, 8), allowing me to move UP toward (8, 9) on the next turn, or continue DOWN/RIGHT toward the apple at (9, 5). Moving LEFT or DOWN right now keeps me closer to the center but makes the apple at (8, 9) harder to get later. Moving RIGHT positions me perfectly to sweep the right-side apples.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (8, 7). From there, I will likely go UP to (8, 8) then (8, 9) to secure that corner apple. After that, I will head DOWN the 9-column to collect the apple at (9, 5) and potentially (9, 0), staying away from Snake #0's current pathing centered around the bottom-right.\n\nRIGHT",

If it moves UP three times, it will reach (8, 7) (where I am now). Currently, it is 3 units below me. There is no risk of a head-on collision *this* turn.\n- **Targeting Apple (8, 9) vs Other Apples:**\n  - The apple at **(8, 9)** is very close (2 moves UP). \n  - The apple at **(9, 5)** is also nearby.\n  - The apple at **(4, 5)** is in the mid-field.\n  - Since I am currently at (8, 7) and my body is at (7, 7) and (7, 8), moving UP is very efficient. It clears me away from the \"bend\" in my tail and secures a corner apple.\n\n**Immediate Plan:**\nMove UP to (8, 8). This puts me one step away from the apple at (8, 9). After collecting (8, 9), I can pivot and head down the 9-column to grab (9, 5) and (9, 0). \n\n**Future Note:**\nSnake #0 is currently moving upwards in the same column (8). By moving UP now, I keep a buffer between us. If I moved DOWN, I would be heading directly into a potential head-on collision or space contest with Snake #0.

Body: [(8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 7)]. \n  - *Previous move:* UP (collected the apple previously at 8, 9). Snake length is now 4.\n- **Snake #0 (Enemy):** Head at (9, 5). Body: [(8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3)].\n- **Apples available:** (0, 0), (4, 5), (9, 0), (2, 2), (1, 3).\n\n**Evaluating Directions for My Snake (8, 9):**\n1. **UP:** Moves to (8, 10). **DEATH.** Off the top edge of the board.\n2. **DOWN:** Moves to (8, 8). **DEATH.** This is my own body segment.\n3. **LEFT:** Moves to (7, 9). **Safe.** Open space on the top row.\n4. **RIGHT:** Moves to (9, 9). **Safe.** Open space in the top right corner.\n\n### Risk Assessment & Strategy\n- **Snake #0 (Enemy):** Located at (9, 5). It is currently 4 squares below the top edge and has turned toward the right wall. It cannot reach the top row (y=9) this turn.\n- **Goal Selection:** \n  - There are no apples on the top edge now. The nearest apples are at (4, 5) and (1, 3).\n  - Apple (4, 5) is approximately 8 steps away.\n  - Apple (9, 0) is approximately 10 steps away, but Snake #0 is closer to it.\n- **Pathing:** Moving **LEFT** is the most productive path. It allows me to stay along the top edge while moving toward the center of the board, positioning me for a descent toward the apple at (4, 5). Moving RIGHT to (9, 9) puts me in a corner and limits my next move to only DOWN (9, 8) or LEFT (8, 9 - body), risking getting trapped against the wall by Snake #0 if it moves up.\n\n### Long-term Plan\nMove LEFT to (7, 9). From there, continue moving LEFT along the top or toward the middle columns (4-6) to approach the apple at (4, 5). This keeps me away from the enemy snake while maintaining a high-ground advantage and plenty of open space to maneuver.\n\nLEFT",

Next safe follow-up moves: UP (9,7), LEFT (8,6) \u2192 2 options (low trapping risk).\n   - **DOWN (9,4)**: No apple eaten \u2192 new body [(9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (8,4)] (tail (8,3) removed). Next safe follow-up move: Only DOWN (9,3) \u2192 1 option (high trapping risk, limits future mobility).\n3. **Apple Proximity & Head-On Collision Risk**:\n   - Neither safe move eats an apple immediately. The nearest apple for UP (9,6) is (4,5) (Manhattan distance 6) and (9,0) (distance 6); for DOWN (9,4) it\u2019s (9,0) (distance 4), but the trapping risk of DOWN outweighs this minor distance benefit.\n   - Enemy Snake #1\u2019s safe moves are LEFT (7,9) and RIGHT (9,9) (their UP/DOWN moves are deadly). None of these overlap with our safe new head positions (9,6, 9,4) \u2192 no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (For Future Self)\n1.

Monitor Snake #1\u2019s movement\u2014their safe moves are LEFT/RIGHT; a LEFT move (7,9) will distance them from our path, while a RIGHT move (9,9) keeps them on the top-right edge (no immediate conflict).\n3. Avoid moving down from (9,4) if possible, as it traps you with only one follow-up move and boxes you near the bottom-right apple (9,0) with limited escape routes.\n4. Continue prioritizing moves with \u22652 follow-up safe options to prevent being cornered as your snake grows.\n\nUP",

Its only safe moves are UP (9, 7) or LEFT (8, 6). It cannot reach me this turn.\n- **Goal Selection:** The closest apple is (4, 5). \n  - Pathing from (7, 9) to (4, 5) requires moving down and left.\n  - If I move **LEFT** to (6, 9), I stay on the edge and keep my body stretched out, which is generally safer.\n  - If I move **DOWN** to (7, 8), I am moving toward the center earlier but potentially creating a \"U-turn\" shape that could be easier to trap.\n- **Decision:** **LEFT** is the superior move. Staying on the perimeter while moving toward the x-coordinate of the apples (x=4 or x=1) allows for a cleaner approach and keeps the center of the board open for maneuvering.\n\n### Long-term Plan\nContinue moving LEFT until reaching x=4 or x=1, then descend (DOWN) to collect the apples at (4, 5) or (1, 3). This keeps the snake's body trailing along the wall, minimizing the surface area vulnerable to being cut off by Snake #0.\n\nLEFT",

It aligns the head with x=4, allowing for a straight descent later.\n  - **DOWN to (6, 8):** Moves into the open board earlier.

Length: 4.\n- **Snake #0 (Enemy):** Head at (7, 6). Body: [(8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5)]. Length: 4.\n- **Apples available:** (0, 0), (4, 5), (9, 0), (2, 2), (1, 3).\n- **Scores:** Tied at 3-3.\n\n**Evaluating Directions for My Snake (5, 9):**\n1. **UP:** Moves to (5, 10). **DEATH** (Off board).\n2. **RIGHT:** Moves to (6, 9). **DEATH** (Directly backwards into body).\n3. **LEFT:** Moves to (4, 9). **Safe.**\n4. **DOWN:** Moves to (5, 8). **Safe.**\n\n### Risk Assessment & Strategy\n- **Enemy Movement (Snake #0):** The enemy is at (7, 6). Their potential moves are (7, 7), (7, 5), or (6, 6). They are currently 3 units vertically and 2 units horizontally away from my head. There is no risk of a head-on collision this turn.\n- **Goal Selection:** The closest apple is (4, 5).\n  - **LEFT to (4, 9):** This aligns my head perfectly with the x-coordinate of the nearest apple (4, 5). It continues the strategy of using the board edge to keep the body compact and the path predictable.\n  - **DOWN to (5, 8):** This moves into the open board. While safe, it doesn't align with the target apple as efficiently as moving to x=4 first.\n\n### Long-term Plan\nI will move **LEFT** to (4, 9). This positioning is ideal because it puts me directly above the apple at (4, 5). On Turn 13, I will begin my descent by moving **DOWN**. By staying at the very top of the board (y=9) until I am aligned with my target, I minimize the amount of \"open space\" I occupy, which reduces the chance of Snake #0 cutting me off. Once (4, 5) is collected, I will pivot toward the remaining cluster at (1, 3) and (2, 2).\n\nLEFT",

However, if they commit to (4, 5), they move away from the cluster at (1, 3) and (2, 2).\n- **Evaluating Move DOWN:** Moving to (4, 7) keeps me on the path to (4, 5) but also leaves me flexible to pivot west if the enemy moves aggressively toward the center.\n- **Body Positioning:** My body is currently trailing along the top edge (y=9).

Length: 4.\n- **Snake #0 (Enemy):** Head at (5, 5). Body: [(6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6)]. Length: 4.\n- **Apples available:** (0, 0), (4, 5), (9, 0), (2, 2), (1, 3).\n- **Scores:** Tied 3-3.\n\n**Evaluating Directions for My Snake (4, 7):**\n1. **UP:** Moves to (4, 8). **DEATH** (Directly backwards into body).\n2. **DOWN:** Moves to (4, 6). **Safe.**\n3. **LEFT:** Moves to (3, 7). **Safe.**\n4. **RIGHT:** Moves to (5, 7). **Safe.**\n\n### Risk Assessment & Strategy\n- **Targeting (4, 5):** This apple is at (4, 5). I am at (4, 7), so it is 2 units below me. Snake #0 is at (5, 5), meaning it is 1 unit to the right of the apple.\n- **The \"Race\" for (4, 5):** Snake #0 can reach (4, 5) in 1 turn (moving LEFT). I can reach it in 2 turns (moving DOWN twice). \n- **Head-on Collision Risk:** If I move DOWN to (4, 6) this turn and Snake #0 moves UP to (5, 6), we are adjacent. If I then move to (4, 5) while they move to (4, 6), no collision occurs. However, if they move LEFT this turn to take (4, 5), they will be at (4, 5) while I am at (4, 6).\n- **Alternative Targeting:** Apples at (1, 3) and (2, 2) are relatively open. If Snake #0 takes (4, 5), they will be positioned at (4, 5), blocking the direct path south.\n\n### Tactical Decision\nMoving **LEFT** to (3, 7) is a safer, more flexible play. \n- If I move DOWN to (4, 6), and Snake #0 moves LEFT to (4, 5), I am directly above their head. \n- If I move LEFT to (3, 7), I maintain distance from Snake #0\u2019s head while positioning myself closer to the \"west\" cluster of apples (1, 3) and (2, 2). This avoids a potential head-on collision or getting cut off in the center.\n\n### Long-term Plan\nI will move **LEFT** to (3, 7). This concedes the apple at (4, 5) to Snake #0 if they want it, but protects me from a head-on collision and positions me to claim (1, 3) and (2, 2) uncontested. While I may fall behind 4-3 temporarily, I will have a clearer path to two apples, whereas Snake #0 will be forced into the center/left area where I can potentially trap them or outmaneuver them for the remaining fruits.\n\nLEFT",

Maintain focus on the clustered apples (1,3, 2,2) to widen the lead over Snake #1\u2019s 3 apples before considering high-risk corner apples (0,0, 9,0) which carry self-trapping risk.\n3. Continue assessing follow-up mobility for each move to avoid dead-ends (steer clear of Snake #1\u2019s upper body near (4,8) unless critical for securing a decisive apple lead).\n4. If Snake #1 makes a risky move (e.g., toward their own body or a corner), capitalize by securing (1,3) or (2,2) to boost your apple count to 6 and extend your lead.\n\nDOWN",

They are currently positioned closer to the cluster of apples at (1, 3) and (2, 2) than I am.\n\n- **Option LEFT to (2, 5):** This provides maximum horizontal distance from Snake #0. If Snake #0 moves LEFT to (3, 3), we are safe. \n- **Option DOWN to (3, 4):** This brings me closer to the apples but puts me in a potential head-on collision threat. If I move to (3, 4) and Snake #0 moves to (3, 3), we are adjacent. If they move UP to (4, 4) or RIGHT to (5, 3), I am safe. However, if they move LEFT to (3, 3), they cut off my path to (1, 3).\n\n### Risk Assessment\nSnake #0's body is currently at (4,4) and (4,5). My head is at (3,5). If I move **LEFT** to (2, 5), I am safe from all immediate body collisions and head-on collisions (since Snake #0 is at (4, 3)). From (2, 5), I can safely drop down to (2, 4) or continue left to (1, 5) to approach (1, 3) from above, avoiding a confrontation with Snake #0's head.\n\nMoving **DOWN** to (3, 4) is aggressive and puts me directly in Snake #0's path. Since I am behind in points (3-5), I need apples, but I cannot afford a head-on collision or to be cornered against the wall.\n\n### Long-term Plan\nI will move **LEFT** to (2, 5). This creates a buffer between me and Snake #0. Next turn, I will likely go DOWN toward (1, 3) or (2, 2). By taking the \"high road\" around Snake #0, I can safely approach the western apples while letting Snake #0 commit to a direction first.\n\nLEFT",

Length: 6.\n- **Apples available:** (0, 0), (9, 0), (2, 2), (1, 3), (8, 4).\n- **Scores:** 5-3 in favor of Snake #0.\n\n**Evaluating Move Directions for (1, 5):**\n1. **UP:** Moves to (1, 6). **Safe.** Open space at (1, 6).\n2. **DOWN:** Moves to (1, 4). **Safe.** Moves toward apple at (1, 3).\n3. **LEFT:** Moves to (0, 5). **Safe.** Moves toward the edge and away from the enemy.\n4. **RIGHT:** Moves to (2, 5). **DEATH** (Directly backwards into body).\n\n### Risk Assessment & Pathing\n- **Snake #0's potential moves:** From (2, 3), their head could reach (1, 3), (3, 3) (backwards/death), (2, 4), or (2, 2). \n- **The (1, 3) Apple:** If I move DOWN to (1, 4), I am 1 move away from (1, 3). However, Snake #0 is currently at (2, 3). If Snake #0 moves LEFT this turn, they reach (1, 3) at the exact same time I reach (1, 4). On the following turn, we would both be aiming for (1, 3), creating a high risk of a head-on collision or me being cut off.\n- **The (2, 2) Apple:** This is closer to Snake #0 than to me.\n- **Collision Risk:** If I move to (1, 4) and Snake #0 moves to (2, 4), we are adjacent. If I move to (1, 4) and they move to (1, 3), they take the apple.\n\n### Strategy\nSince Snake #0 is ahead in points (5-3), they have the advantage. My goal is to intercept an apple without dying. \nMoving **DOWN** to (1, 4) is the most direct way to contest the (1, 3) apple. If Snake #0 moves to (2, 4) or (1, 3), I will have to bait them or retreat. If I move **LEFT** to (0, 5), I am playing very defensively, which might let Snake #0 sweep all the bottom-left apples.\n\nThe safest way to approach the clusters is to move **DOWN**. This puts pressure on (1, 3). If Snake #0 moves for (1, 3) this turn, I will be at (1, 4) and can then pivot LEFT to (0, 4) to head for the (0, 0) apple, avoiding their body.\n\n### Long-term Plan\nI will move **DOWN** to (1, 4). This prepares me to take the apple at (1, 3) if Snake #0 goes for (2, 2), or to pivot toward the (0, 0) apple if they block me. I must be careful not to get pinned against the left wall.\n\nDOWN",

They have a length advantage (8 vs 4). Their head is two units away from yours. \n- If I move **DOWN** to (0, 2):\n    - Snake #0 could move to (1, 2) (taking their own neck spot as it clears), (2, 1), (3, 2), or (2, 3).\n    - If they move to (1, 2), they are adjacent to me. If they then move to (0, 2) on Turn 25 while I move to (0, 1), we stay safe. If they move to (1, 1), they are tracking me toward the apple.\n- **The apple at (0, 0)** is the priority. It is at (0, 0). My current path is (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 0).\n\n### Long-term Plan\nMove toward (0, 0). I am currently forced into a narrow corridor by the edge of the board and Snake #0's body. Once I reach (0, 0), I will need to be careful. Snake #0 is much longer and could attempt to pin me against the left wall. I must secure (0, 0) and then immediately look for an exit strategy toward the bottom-right (9, 0) or through any gaps Snake #0 leaves as they move toward (5, 3).\n\nDOWN",

Moving here is high risk for no reward.\n\n### Risk Assessment & Strategy\n\n- **Only one clearly safe and productive move exists:** **DOWN** to (0, 1). \n- **Snake #0** is at (3, 2). They have several move options. If they move LEFT to (2, 2), they are moving toward me. However, they are currently blocked by their own body at (2, 3) and (3, 3), limiting their mobility.\n- **Goal:** The apple at (0, 0) is only 2 moves away. Moving to (0, 1) this turn and (0,0) next turn is the most direct path to scoring.\n\n### Long-term Plan\nSecure the apple at (0, 0). After eating it at (0, 0), my body will be length 5. I will be pinned against the bottom-left corner. I must then head RIGHT along the Y=0 line toward the apple at (9, 0) to avoid being trapped against the wall by Snake #0, who is much larger and likely to move toward the center apples at (5, 3) or (3, 4).\n\nDOWN",
