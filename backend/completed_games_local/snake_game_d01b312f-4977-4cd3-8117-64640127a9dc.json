It\u2019s the closest apple.  \n2. It gives me a score lead early.  \n3. Even with fewer next-move options, I can still maneuver safely next turn.  \n\nSo **DOWN** to (0, 6) seems best.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (0, 6), my body will be [(0, 6), (0, 7)].

UP moves away from most apples.  \n\nI prefer DOWN or RIGHT for apple proximity.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Tie-breaker**  \n\nDOWN to (2,3) gets me closest to (4,3) in Manhattan distance (2), but RIGHT to (3,4) gets me equally close to (4,3) and (5,4) (both distance 2).  \nRIGHT also keeps me more central with more options next turn toward multiple apples.  \n\nHowever, enemy at (3,6) could move DOWN to (3,5) or LEFT to (2,6). If I go RIGHT to (3,4), enemy could go DOWN to (3,5) \u2192 then we\u2019d be adjacent vertically next turn, increasing risk of head-on collision if we both move toward same apple.  \n\nDOWN to (2,3) avoids that adjacency risk and still targets nearest apple (4,3).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (2,3), I can go RIGHT toward (4,3) or (5,4). Keep enemy\u2019s position in mind\u2014they might go for (5,4) or (6,5). If they move toward (4,3), I might target (5,4) instead to avoid head-on. Stay flexible.  \n\nDOWN",

If enemy moves away, maybe safe? But simultaneous move means if enemy stays there or moves into that cell from elsewhere, collision possible. Let\u2019s analyze later.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 2) \u2192 empty, safe? Check board: board shows empty at (3, 2).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 my own body segment \u2192 death (backwards into body).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 apple there.  \n\n**Check enemy\u2019s possible moves from (3, 4):**  \nEnemy can go: UP (3, 5) its own body \u2192 death, DOWN (3, 3) my head now \u2192 collision possible, LEFT (2, 4) empty, RIGHT (4, 4) empty.  \nSo enemy will likely avoid UP (death) and DOWN (into my head currently, but simultaneous move means if I move away, it\u2019s safe for them? Actually if I move to (3, 4) and they move to (3, 3), heads swap \u2192 no head-on? Wait, they\u2019d be moving into my old head position which I vacated, but my new head is at (3, 4) and theirs at (3, 3), so no collision. But if we both move into each other\u2019s old positions, heads don\u2019t meet. But if I go UP to (3, 4) and they go DOWN to (3, 3), then we swap positions safely. However, if they choose LEFT or RIGHT instead, then (3, 4) is empty when I arrive, so safe. So UP might be safe unless enemy chooses DOWN (then heads swap safely). Actually heads swapping is safe because no two heads occupy same cell. So UP seems safe.  \n\nBut let\u2019s check:  \nIf I go UP to (3, 4) and enemy goes DOWN to (3, 3):  \nMy new head: (3, 4), enemy new head: (3, 3). No collision.  \nIf I go UP and enemy goes LEFT to (2, 4): safe.  \nIf I go UP and enemy goes RIGHT to (4, 4): safe.  \nIf I go UP and enemy goes UP to (3, 5) \u2192 enemy dies (into own body), so unlikely.  \n\nSo UP is safe from immediate death.  \n\n**RIGHT to (4, 3)** \u2192 apple there, so I grow to length 3 after eating. But new head position (4, 3) is adjacent to enemy head (3, 4) \u2192 enemy could move RIGHT to (4, 4) or DOWN to (3, 3) or LEFT to (2, 4) or UP to (3, 5). If enemy moves LEFT to (2, 4) or UP to (3, 5), fine. If enemy moves DOWN to (3, 3), fine. If enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 4), fine. So no immediate danger.  \n\n**DOWN to (3, 2)** \u2192 safe, no apple, moves away from enemy.  \n\n**LEFT** \u2192 death.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, RIGHT, DOWN.  \n\n**Which is best?**  \n- RIGHT: gets apple at (4, 3), grows to length 3, but puts me at (4, 3) with enemy at (3, 4) adjacent. Next turn enemy could move into (4, 3) if I stay? But simultaneous move means if enemy moves into my head\u2019s new cell, we collide head-on only if I stay still. If I move away, they move into where I was. So after eating apple, my body will be [(4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3)], tail at (2, 3). Enemy head adjacent at (3, 4). If I move UP from (4, 3) \u2192 (4, 4), enemy could move RIGHT to (4, 4) too \u2192 head-on collision. That\u2019s risky. So maybe avoid being adjacent after eating if possible.  \n\n- UP: moves to (3, 4), enemy likely won\u2019t stay there (they\u2019d die if they go UP into own body), they\u2019ll likely move LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN. If they move DOWN to (3, 3) I vacated, safe swap. If they move LEFT/RIGHT, I occupy (3, 4) safely. But (3, 4) has no apple. Puts me close to apple at (5, 4) or (4, 3) still nearby.  \n\n- DOWN: safe, but away from apples.  \n\nI think RIGHT is good for score, but need to check head-on risk next turn. Actually, after RIGHT to (4, 3), enemy at (3, 4) could move RIGHT to (4, 4) or DOWN to (3, 3) etc. If I then next turn move UP to (4, 4), possible head-on if enemy also goes RIGHT this turn to (4, 4)? Wait, enemy can\u2019t be at (4, 4) now, they\u2019re at (3, 4). So next turn enemy could move to (4, 4) if they choose RIGHT now. But they don\u2019t know my move. They might avoid going RIGHT because it\u2019s closer to my head? Not sure.  \n\nGiven enemy likely wants to avoid dying, they might move LEFT or DOWN. Let\u2019s assume they move DOWN to (3, 3) (safe for them). Then I\u2019m at (4, 3), they\u2019re at (3, 3), no adjacency. Good.  \n\nActually, safest for growth: RIGHT gets apple, growth, and possible safe follow-ups.  \n\nUP is also safe but no apple.  \n\nLet\u2019s choose **RIGHT** for the apple and growth.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (4, 3) and eating apple, my length will be 3: head (4, 3), body [(3, 3), (2, 3)]. Enemy head somewhere. Check adjacency and avoid moving into possible enemy move. Prefer to move towards open space, maybe DOWN to (4, 2) if safe, to avoid head-on risk with enemy if they\u2019re at (3, 4) or (3, 3).  \n\nRIGHT",

So moving to (4, 4) only dangerous if enemy stays there (head-on) or if enemy moves into (4, 4) from (4, 4)? Actually enemy is at (4, 4) now, so if I go to (4, 4) and enemy stays there \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 both die. If enemy leaves (4, 4) to another cell, then (4, 4) is empty for me, but enemy\u2019s body at (3, 4) is not in my target cell. So UP is risky because of possible head-on if enemy stays.\n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 2) \u2192 empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 3) \u2192 my own body \u2192 death.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 3) \u2192 empty, safe.\n\n**Check enemy\u2019s possible moves from (4, 4):**\nEnemy can go: UP (4, 5) empty, DOWN (4, 3) my head now (but I\u2019ll move), LEFT (3, 4) its own body \u2192 death, RIGHT (5, 4) empty (but has apple).  \nSo enemy will likely avoid LEFT (death). They could go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (4, 3) and I go UP to (4, 4), we swap heads safely. But if enemy stays at (4, 4) and I go UP \u2192 head-on collision.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (5, 4) and I go UP to (4, 4), safe for me (they left).  \n\nSo UP is risky but not guaranteed death \u2014 depends on enemy\u2019s move.\n\n**Safety first:**\nUP could be safe if enemy moves away, but we can\u2019t guarantee that. Since enemy has a safe move (RIGHT to apple, UP to empty, DOWN to my current spot if I leave), they might move. But they could also stay to block me if they predict my move.  \nGiven the rules, it\u2019s better to avoid risky head-on possibilities when other safe moves exist.\n\nDOWN (4, 2) and RIGHT (5, 3) are definitely safe (no walls, no bodies now, no enemy heads there now, and even if enemy moves there, it\u2019s simultaneous \u2014 but enemy can\u2019t be at (4, 2) or (5, 3) next turn unless they move two cells, impossible).\n\n**Apple proximity:**\nApple at (5, 4) is 1 step away from my head if I go RIGHT then UP, or 2 steps if I go UP then RIGHT (but UP risky).  \nApple at (6, 5) is farther.  \nApple at (7, 5) and (5, 6) also farther.  \nApple at (8, 0) far.\n\nRIGHT puts me at (5, 3), closer to apple at (5, 4) (one step up next turn).  \nDOWN puts me at (4, 2), farther from most apples.\n\n**Future options:**\nFrom (5, 3), possible moves next turn: UP to (5, 4) apple, LEFT to (4, 3) my old head (now empty), RIGHT to (6, 3) empty, DOWN to (5, 2) empty. Good options.  \nFrom (4, 2), possible moves: UP to (4, 3) empty, LEFT to (3, 2) empty, RIGHT to (5, 2) empty, DOWN to (4, 1) empty. Also good but farther from apples.\n\n**Enemy threat:**\nEnemy at (4, 4) could go RIGHT to (5, 4) apple, so they might get that apple next turn. If I go RIGHT to (5, 3), I could go UP to (5, 4) next turn, possibly racing them. But if they go RIGHT this turn to (5, 4), they\u2019ll be at (5, 4) next turn and I can\u2019t move into that cell if they stay. But they might eat it and move on.\n\nGiven my length advantage (3 vs 2), I can afford to be slightly aggressive for apples, but staying alive is top priority.\n\n**Decision:**\nUP is risky due to possible head-on.  \nDOWN is safe but not toward apples.  \nRIGHT is safe and toward nearest apple.\n\nI\u2019ll choose RIGHT.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**\nIf enemy moves to (5, 4) and eats apple, they\u2019ll grow to length 3, same as me. Then they\u2019ll be at (5, 4) with body extending to (4, 4) and (3, 4). I\u2019ll be at (5, 3). From there, I can avoid moving into them, maybe go LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT depending on board.

Next head at (6, 5), new body: [(6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (5, 3)].  \n  Next turn possible moves from (6, 5): UP (6, 6), DOWN (6, 4), LEFT (5, 5), RIGHT (7, 5).  \n  - UP (6, 6): empty now, but enemy could be there if enemy moves RIGHT from (5, 6) to (6, 6) this turn \u2014 possible head-on collision next turn if both choose that.  \n  - DOWN (6, 4): my new body after growth occupies (6, 4), so death.  \n  - LEFT (5, 5): enemy body segment currently, and enemy head moving from (5, 6) could go DOWN to (5, 5) this turn \u2014 then (5, 5) is enemy head next turn? Wait, enemy head moves this turn, so (5, 5) could become enemy head if they move DOWN, but then they die because (5, 5) is their own body? Let's check: Enemy body: [(5, 5), (5, 4), (4, 4)] currently. If enemy moves DOWN to (5, 5), that's moving into own body \u2192 death for enemy. So enemy likely won't do that. But if enemy moves elsewhere, (5, 5) is their body segment next turn (since they didn't eat apple). So (5, 5) will be enemy body next turn \u2192 unsafe for me to move into.  \n  - RIGHT (7, 5): apple currently there, could be safe unless enemy goes to (7, 5)? Enemy can't reach (7, 5) in one move from (5, 6). So likely safe next turn.  \n\nSo if I eat apple at (6, 5), next turn only safe moves likely UP or RIGHT (DOWN into own body, LEFT into enemy body). That's risky.\n\n- **RIGHT to (7, 4)**: No apple, but safe. Next turn from (7, 4):  \n  Possible moves: UP (7, 5) apple, DOWN (7, 3) empty, LEFT (6, 4) my body, RIGHT (8, 4) empty.  \n  That gives 3 safe options next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) if (6, 4) is my body then. More flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy\u2019s possible moves from (5, 6):**\n- UP (5, 7): empty.\n- DOWN (5, 5): own body \u2192 death.\n- LEFT (4, 6): empty.\n- RIGHT (6, 6): empty.\n\nEnemy will likely avoid DOWN. They might go for apple at (4, 8) later, but not reachable in 1. They might move toward (7, 5) apple later.  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (6, 6), they\u2019re close to apple at (6, 5) but can\u2019t get it this turn. They\u2019d be adjacent to it next turn.\n\nIf I take apple at (6, 5), enemy at (6, 6) next turn could go DOWN to (6, 5) into my head if I\u2019m still there \u2014 but I\u2019d move away. Still, risky adjacency.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nIf I eat apple now, I risk being near enemy with fewer future moves. Better to stay flexible: go RIGHT to (7, 4), then next turn possibly UP to (7, 5) apple, or move to open space. Lets me grow safely while keeping distance from enemy head.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nRIGHT",
