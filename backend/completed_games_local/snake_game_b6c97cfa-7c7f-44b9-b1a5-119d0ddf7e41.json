Does not hit any bodies (mine or opponent's; opponent has no body and head is far at (8,7)). Not off-board. So valid.\n- DOWN: Moves to (0,6). Safe, no obstacles. Valid.\n\nBoth UP and DOWN are safe. Enemy head is at (8,7), and will move simultaneously, but neither move puts me on a trajectory for immediate head-on collision (e.g., if they move LEFT, they'd go to (7,7), far from me; if RIGHT, to (9,7), still distant).\n\nNow, evaluating strategy among safe moves: Prefer moves closer to reachable apples while keeping options open (avoid traps like dead-ends or tight spaces). My last plan was to head DOWN after eating the apple, to chase the row of bottom apples at (2,0), (5,0), (9,0)\u2014(0,0) was just eaten. Apple at (4,1) is on row 1, somewhat nearby. Apple at (1,3) is also reachable without much detour.\n\n- DOWN keeps me on the left edge near bottoms apples, and from (0,6), I have many open follow-up moves (e.g., RIGHT to (1,6) for space/ ((1,3) apple), UP to comeback or continue down without restrictions). This positions me well for early apple grabs and growth, while the board's left side is mostly empty.\n\n- UP moves me north to (0,8), away from most apples (bottom row and (1,3)), and from (0,8), I'd have options to go RIGHT toward mid-board (potentially tighter spaces) or continue up (fewer apples). It's safe but less purposeful for scoring and leaves me farther from targets.\n\nDOWN is better for proximity to apples and board control, aligning with the prior plan. No obvious traps ahead (board is open downward).\n\nLong-term plan for next few turns: Continue moving DOWN or slightly RIGHT as needed to target the closest bottom-row apples (e.g., (2,0) seems reachable via (0,someth) to (1,something) to (2,0)). Keep note of enemy at (8,7)\u2014they might head down too, so monitor for potential interference near (9,0) or mid-board. If enemy gets too close or I need to loop around (1,3) apple first, pivot, but prioritize bottom row for chain-eating while staying on edges to avoid tight spots.\n\nDOWN",

It keeps a straight vertical path open (further DOWN to (1,1), (1,0), then RIGHT to (2,0) for an eat by turn 10, score likely 3). This avoids isolation and leads to more apples long-term (3 potential vs. spawning isolated ones like (3,3) or (4,1)). Bottom apples are densely grouped horizontally, offering good chaining after reaching y=0.\n- UP moves higher, away from all apples, into less congested area (top half of board is mostly empty), but reduces proximity to reachable apples immediately. It might keep options open in a vertical direction but stray from clustering strategy, potentially allowing enemy to claim bottom apples first (enemy at (8,2) could head right/down).\n- Prioritizing DOWN continues momentum toward bottom without congesting. No traps: bottom row is wide open horizontally. Compared to RIGHT (which leads quickly to (3,3) for an eat by turn 8 and early score 3/growth), DOWN delays eats slightly but positions for multiple (chain potential vs. single eat then need to redirect). Early growth is good, but clustering better maximizes apples safely with many turns left (143 remaining), avoiding mid-board confinement.\n- Futuristic: Enemy length 1, score 0, so focus on score lead; they seem headed right/bottom for (9,0), so left-side occupation fits.\n\nPreferred choice: DOWN for safe apple pursuit and option-keeping (vertical descent opens horizontal sweeping later).\n\n### Long-term Plan\nStarted descent after the (1,3) eat; now at head (1,2), body (1,3), tail (0,3), score=2.

Valid and safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nStrategic evaluation:\n- DOWN advances toward the bottom-row apple chain ((2,0), (5,0), (9,0)), positioning for an easy RIGHT next turn to (2,0) for an instant eat. The y=0 row is very open with 10 cells, keeping multiple follow-up moves (LEFT/RIGHT) available and avoiding dead-ends or tight spaces. This prioritizes chaining dense apples early while maintaining the score lead (2-0); reduces risk of enemy interference since the enemy (length 1, far west at (7,1)) is unlikely to reach y=0 this turn (would take multiple moves east/south). No potential head-on collisions likely this turn\u2014enemy's possible moves (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT) won't intersect (1,0); future turns could loop around if needed.\n- LEFT moves west toward the left wall at y=1, potentially leading to an eat at (0,0) if it's apple (board shows A there, even if not listed). However, this strays from the denser southeastern cluster, offers fewer immediate eat opportunities (next closest is (2,0) but requires backtracking via DOWN), and increases congestion risk if enemy pushes left\u2014less optimal for chaining given remaining turns (141) and my lead.\n- RIGHT moves east on y=1 toward (4,1), enabling a quick eat (e.g., RIGHTx3 to (4,1) by turn 12), but keeps me mid-board with vertical options (DOWN for y=0 chains or UP/LEFT for (3,3)). While safe, it slightly delays the bottom row chain compared to DOWN, and potential enemy head-ons are higher if they move south/left\u2014prioritize density and speed for the lead.\n\nPreferred choice: DOWN for safest, most efficient progression to apple chaining without reducing mobility or creating trap risks.\n\n### Long-term Plan\nAfter DOWN to (1,0), move RIGHT next turn to eat (2,0) and secure early chain access to (5,0) and beyond. Sweep y=0 eastward for 3-4+ quick apples, then adjust based on enemy (e.g., retreat northward via (1,0) if they close in from the right for (4,1)).
