Then move left along the bottom (toward (8,1) \u2192 (7,1) \u2192 ...), working toward the bottom apples like (2,0) or (0,1), while avoiding the enemy's dense body on y=2 and watching the enemy head to prevent any head-on conflicts.

The vertical column above me (8,3..8,7) is currently unoccupied, so I can approach that apple safely for now.

So I should go UP, eat the apple, and keep pressure in the top-right to potentially contest the (8,8) and (3,8) apples while leaving room to fall back if the other snake comes up.\n\nPlan: After grabbing the (8,8) apple, stay in the upper-right quadrant, watch Snake #0\u2019s reactions, and only commit to deeper incursions once I can be sure their head isn\u2019t racing into me for a collision.\n\nUP",

Puts me closer to the apples at (8,8)/(8,7) but places me directly below the enemy head at (8,7) and opens a risk of a HEAD-ON if the enemy moves DOWN into (8,6). From (8,6) my only good follow-up is LEFT to (7,6) (RIGHT is blocked by my body at 9,6, DOWN would be moving backward into the neck).\n- LEFT -> (7,5): safe and not directly contesting the enemy head. Keeps multiple follow-ups (7,6) or 7,4 available and avoids immediate head-on risk.\n- RIGHT -> (9,5): illegal (my body occupies 9,5).\n- DOWN -> (8,4): illegal (into my neck / immediate death).\n\nEvaluation:\n- UP is tempting to contest the nearby apples, but the enemy head at (8,7) can move DOWN to (8,6) and cause a head-on collision this turn. Even if the enemy moves up to the apple, moving into (8,6) significantly reduces my escape options (right is blocked), effectively creating a one-lane fight.\n- LEFT is the safer play: it avoids immediate head-on, keeps two safe follow-ups, and preserves maneuverability away from the enemy\u2019s long vertical column around x=6. It does not hand an immediate suicide risk and keeps me in play to seek other apples or circle back to contest later on safer terms.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move left to (7,5), then evaluate (prefer going to 7,6 or 7,4 depending on enemy moves). From there, try to skirt around the enemy\u2019s column (x=6) rather than plunging into it, and look for a safe route to apples on the left/top (like (3,8) or (0,6)) or re-approach the (8,8) area only if the enemy\u2019s head is no longer an immediate threat.\n\nLEFT",

It follows the previous plan to use the bottom row to reach (2,0) and then (0,1)/(0,6).\n- LEFT is feasible now but risks getting squeezed by the enemy column around x=6 (their body occupies many cells at y\u22652). Moving LEFT could reduce escape routes and invite head-on risk if the enemy shifts toward that gap.\n- Staying low minimizes head-on collision risk with the enemy head at (4,8) and keeps access to immediately reachable apples.\n\nShort-term plan for the next few turns:\n- Move DOWN to (7,0) now, then go left along y=0 toward (2,0) to collect that apple.\n- After taking (2,0), go up to (0,1) and possibly (0,6) if safe.

UP to (3,9) is clear, keeps me near the board boundary but not trapped, and puts me on the same row as the apple at (6,9), which is relatively unencumbered by Snake #0\u2019s position.\n\nI\u2019m going to capitalize on the northern space: moving UP gives me a direct line along the top row toward (6,9), and if Snake #0 continues to stay low I can circle left afterward toward the cluster of apples near the west edge. This also keeps multiple follow-up options open (LEFT toward the west apples or BACK DOWN if needed) without getting boxed in.\n\nPlan: Reach (6,9) from the top row, then swing west to clean up the apples near the left edge while staying out of Snake #0\u2019s vertical column.\n\nUP",

Moving left starts a clear, unobstructed path along y=0 to reach it.\n- The enemy is far away (head at (3,8)) and their vertical column at x=6 is mostly at y>=2, so the bottom row is currently safe.\n- RIGHT risks tightening my space near my own body and the board edge; LEFT preserves more free cells and future maneuverability.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move LEFT along y=0 toward (2,0) and eat that apple.\n- After (2,0), proceed to (0,1) and then evaluate contesting (0,6) or (5,4)/(6,9) depending on the enemy's movements.\n- Avoid entering tight areas near the enemy's x=6 column if it would trap me.\n\nLEFT",

Taking UP preserves a long, safe corridor and keeps multiple follow-up moves available after I reach the apple.\n\nShort plan (for next turns):\n- Keep moving up the 0-column to eat the apple at (0,6).\n- After eating, re-evaluate: prefer to avoid the crowded x\u22656 region, then move toward reachable apples (likely (5,4)/(5,3) or (2,1)) while maintaining open space and avoiding head-on risks.\n- If an opponent moves toward column 0 unexpectedly, re-plan to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nUP",

Both UP and RIGHT are immediately safe.\n- Moving RIGHT begins a route toward the apples but pushes me toward the crowded/right-hand area where Snake #1 occupies much of the top/right edge; that risks getting boxed in or encountering enemy body/head in future turns.\n- Moving UP preserves open space along the left edge (x=0), keeps many follow-up options (further UP, or swing right later), and avoids moving toward the dense enemy territory. It reduces immediate risk of getting trapped by my own body in the lower rows and gives time to plan a safe approach to the nearby apples (notably (2,1) or (5,4)).\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Move up to create space and avoid the congested right side.\n- Re-evaluate enemy movement next turn; if the right side becomes safer, pivot toward (2,1) or (5,4) while avoiding moving into my own body chain.\n- Prioritize staying in open columns (x=0\u20132) until I can reach an apple without head-on collision risk.\n\nUP",

Keeping three exits is preferable to avoid being boxed in by Snake #1\u2019s long body along the top/right.\n- Opponent head is far away at (9,1), so there is no immediate head-on threat to (1,8).\n\nStrategic intent (next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT now to preserve freedom of movement and to start shifting toward the center/bottom where the remaining apples (notably (2,1)) are reachable.\n- Avoid climbing to the very top edge where my options would shrink; prefer staying one column in from the edge when safe.\n- Re-evaluate the opponent\u2019s movements next turn and choose a path that keeps at least two escape routes while approaching an apple.\n\nDecision: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

It\u2019s the safest way to secure a point and preserve escape routes.\n\nShort long-term plan (for next few turns):\n- Move down to approach and take the apple at (2,1).\n- After eating, re-evaluate opponent movements; if the opponent commits to the right side, continue collecting apples along the bottom/center corridor and use my better mobility to avoid head-on fights.\n- Avoid moving into tight pockets along the top/right where the enemy has long body coverage; prefer routes that keep 2+ non-backwards options.\n\nDOWN",

That would reduce future mobility and risk getting trapped.\n- UP -> (3,2): empty and not contestable by the enemy head this turn. Keeps multiple escape routes open (can continue up or move laterally), avoids head-on risk, and preserves flexibility to approach apples safely.\n\nShort long-term plan: Move UP to (3,2) this turn to avoid a head-on with snake #1 and retain freedom of movement. From there, reassess \u2014 prefer to approach apples while attacking them from less-contested directions (avoid the direct y=1 corridor toward (6,1) while the enemy head sits at (5,1)).

Also viable, but it pushes me back toward my own body on the left and away from the richer apple cluster; it offers fewer high-value apple options.\n- RIGHT -> (5,4): occupied by enemy body (snake #1 at (5,4)) \u2014 would kill me. Illegal.\n- DOWN -> (4,3): my neck \u2014 illegal (backwards).\n\nRisk assessment:\n- No immediate head-on threat from snake #1 (head at (6,2)) to either (4,5) or (3,4) this turn. Right is definitely deadly. Left is more likely to funnel me into my own body or into tight spaces near the left edge. UP keeps maximum mobility and heads me toward several nearby apples that are reachable within a few safe moves.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Continue UP toward (5,7). From (4,5) take (5,5)->(5,6)->(5,7) to get that apple, then contest (7,6)/(8,6)/(8,8) as opportunity allows.\n- Avoid descending into the y\u22642 corridor where the enemy has heavy presence and narrow escape options.\n- Maintain at least two escape options from each cell to avoid being trapped against my own body or the board edge.\n\nUP",
