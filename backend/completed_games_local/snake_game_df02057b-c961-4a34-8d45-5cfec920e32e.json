Left or Right do not progress toward an apple as directly and could lead to slower progress or potential traps, though they remain safe.\n\nLong-term plan:\nKeep heading toward apples while avoiding dead-ends and potential head-on collisions with the enemy head at (0,7).

Moving UP keeps you on the right edge and toward that apple with minimal risk from the left-side snake.\n\n- Moving DOWN would move away from apples and give up the opportunity to advance toward (9,5) quickly; it also risks getting pressed toward the bottom edge later.\n\n- The left enemy snake is distant, so moving UP keeps space to maneuver and reduces collision risk with others this turn.\n\nPlan:\n- Short-term: Move UP now to start advancing toward the apple at (9,5). If you reach and eat it, you\u2019ll grow and gain more leverage on future turns.\n- Mid-term: After securing (9,5), consider targeting (7,5) or (6,9) depending on enemy movements, while continuing to hug the right edge to maximize escape routes.\n- Long-term: Maintain safer routes, avoid self-trapping, and push toward 50 apples to win, keeping an eye on enemy snake positions and potential head-on risks.\n\nUP",

On the next turn, reassess safety and aim to shift toward open space below the dense middle barrier, steering away from the y=2 row (which is heavily occupied). If an apple becomes reachable without risking collision, pivot toward it; otherwise maintain a safe corridor and avoid head-on or self-collisions with Snake #0. If enemy snakes die or vacate space, adjust to chase remaining apples and maximize growth while keeping options open.\n\n- Long-term note: Prioritize staying alive and keeping multiple safe routes. Avoid tight traps, especially around the crowded vertical/diagonal corridors near your current position. Use space to maneuver toward apples that are least contested.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Reasoning:\n- From head (7,3), UP would move into (7,4) which is part of your body, so it's deadly. DOWN would move into (7,2) also part of your body, so unsafe. That leaves LEFT to (6,3) and RIGHT to (8,3) as the only safe immediate moves.\n- Apples are at (6,9), (8,9), (8,6), (3,8), (2,5). The nearest is (8,6). Moving RIGHT to (8,3) does reduce the distance to (8,6) in the next step, but it creates a trap: after RIGHT, the only safe follow-up is UP to (8,4); from (8,4) all four directions would collide with your own body, so you would die on the subsequent turn.\n- Moving LEFT to (6,3) is safe and provides a longer survivability window: the only safe continuation is LEFT to (5,3); after that, all moves would collide with your body as well, but you survive one extra turn compared to choosing RIGHT.\n- Therefore, LEFT maximizes survival time given the current body layout, even though it doesn\u2019t immediately eat an apple.\n\nPlan:\n- Prioritize moves that keep you alive first. If both options eventually trap you, choose the path that yields the most turns alive before the trap activates.\n\nLEFT",
