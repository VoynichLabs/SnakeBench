No (snake #0 has no body yet, my snake has no body).  \n- Apple? No apple at (9, 2).  \n- Safe from head-on collision? Enemy snake #0 head at (7, 11) is far away.  \n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (9, 0):  \n- On board? Yes.  \n- Occupied? No.  \n- Apple? No apple at (9, 0).  \n- Safe.  \n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (8, 1):  \n- On board? Yes.  \n- Occupied? No.  \n- Apple? Apple at (8, 8) not relevant. No apple at (8, 1).  \n- Safe.  \n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (10, 1):  \n- On board? Yes (x=10, y=1).  \n- Occupied? No.  \n- Apple? No apple at (10, 1).  \n- Safe.  \n\nAll four moves are safe.  \n\nNow, which move helps toward apples and keeps future options open?  \n\nApples nearby:  \n- (8, 8) \u2013 far.  \n- (4, 1) \u2013 far.  \n- (10, 5) \u2013 far.  \n- (6, 4) \u2013 far.  \n- (0, 2), (5, 2), (2, 0), (3, 3), etc.  \n\nClosest apple to (9, 1) in Manhattan distance:  \n- (4, 1) \u2192 distance 5.  \n- (8, 8) \u2192 distance 8.  \n- (10, 5) \u2192 distance 5.  \n- (6, 4) \u2192 distance 6.  \n- (0, 1) \u2192 distance 9.  \n\nSo (4, 1) and (10, 5) both distance 5.  \n\nFrom (9, 1):  \n- To (4, 1): go LEFT (decrease x).  \n- To (10, 5): go RIGHT then UP.  \n\nBut (10, 5) is farther in y direction. (4, 1) is straight left along y=1.  \n\nLet\u2019s check board density:  \n- If I go LEFT to (8, 1), I\u2019m closer to (4, 1).  \n- If I go RIGHT to (10, 1), I\u2019m closer to (10, 5) but also near edge (x=11 is wall).  \n\nBetter to go toward center to keep options open. (8, 1) is fine, but (9, 2) is even more central.  \n\nAlso, enemy snake #0 is at (7, 11), far away, so no immediate collision risk.  \n\nI should think about not boxing myself in later. Going UP to (9, 2) opens up more possible moves next turn (up/down/left/right likely all safe).  \n\nGoing LEFT to (8, 1) is also fine.  \n\nBut let\u2019s consider: my body length is 1, so I can reverse direction next turn if needed.  \n\nI\u2019ll pick **UP** to move toward center and have more space.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** Continue moving toward nearest apple while avoiding future dead ends. Possibly aim for (4, 1) via leftward movement after gaining height.  \n\nUP",

No collision risk for now.  \n\n**Choice:**  \nLEFT to (4, 2) seems best because:  \n1. It moves toward both (4, 3) and (4, 1) apples equally.  \n2. From (4, 2), three directions will be open next turn (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n3. It avoids moving into the far edge too quickly.  \n\nUP is also fine but slightly farther from (4, 1).  \nDOWN is fine but slightly farther from (4, 3).  \nLEFT gives the most balanced options.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 2), assess whether to go UP to (4, 3) for apple or DOWN to (4, 1) for apple, depending on enemy movement and board state. Keep tail growth in mind to avoid boxing myself later.  \n\nLEFT",

Yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No (body at (4, 2), (5, 2)).  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No (enemy body at (7, 9), head at (7, 8)).  \n   - Possible head-on collision? Enemy head at (7, 8) could move in any direction but can't reach (4, 4) in one move (distance too far).  \n   \u2192 Safe.  \n\n2. **DOWN (4, 2)**  \n   - My body occupies (4, 2) \u2192 suicide \u2192 eliminate.  \n\n3. **LEFT (3, 3)**  \n   - In bounds? Yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n   - Apple present? Yes \u2192 will grow by 1 segment after eating.  \n   - Possible head-on collision? Enemy at (7, 8) too far.  \n   \u2192 Safe.  \n\n4. **RIGHT (5, 3)**  \n   - In bounds? Yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n   \u2192 Safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Safe moves:** UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term strategy considerations:**  \n- Eating an apple is good for score, but need to think about space after growing.  \n- Board is 12\u00d712, many apples around.  \n- My current length is 3, so not huge yet.  \n\nLEFT (3, 3) \u2192 eats apple \u2192 length becomes 4. After move, new head at (3, 3), body becomes [(4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2)] + tail? Wait, growth means tail stays same length, so new segment appears at old tail? Actually in Snake, when you eat, you grow by 1 at next move (tail doesn\u2019t move that turn). But here, immediate growth means one extra segment appended after moving? Actually standard Snake: you move head to apple, body follows, tail doesn\u2019t move that turn \u2192 length increases by 1. So after eating apple, next turn my body will be longer.  \n\nCheck space around (3, 3) after moving there:  \nFrom (3, 3): possible moves next turn:  \n- UP (3, 4) \u2192 empty  \n- DOWN (3, 2) \u2192 empty  \n- LEFT (2, 3) \u2192 empty  \n- RIGHT (4, 3) \u2192 occupied by my own neck (current head position), so not safe next turn? Actually next turn my neck becomes body segment, so (4, 3) will be my body \u2192 can't reverse into it. But moving right from (3, 3) to (4, 3) next turn would be suicide. So from (3, 3), RIGHT would be unsafe next turn. But that's okay, other directions open.  \n\nFrom (4, 4) if I go UP now:  \n(4, 4) next turn moves:  \nUP (4, 5) \u2192 empty  \nDOWN (4, 3) \u2192 my neck (current head) will be body \u2192 unsafe  \nLEFT (3, 4) \u2192 empty  \nRIGHT (5, 4) \u2192 empty  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn from (4, 4).  \n\nFrom (5, 3) if I go RIGHT now:  \n(5, 3) next turn moves:  \nUP (5, 4) empty  \nDOWN (5, 2) my body (second segment currently) will be there next turn? Let's check: My body now: head (4, 3), then (4, 2), then (5, 2) as tail. If I move RIGHT to (5, 3), body shifts: new head (5, 3), then (4, 3), then (4, 2), tail (5, 2) gone? Wait, length 3, so after move without eating: head to (5, 3), neck (4, 3), second segment (4, 2), tail disappears? No, tail moves? Actually in Snake, all segments shift: old tail (5, 2) disappears, new segment added at head only if apple eaten. So new body: [(5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2)], tail was (5, 2) and is gone. So (5, 2) empty next turn.  \nThus from (5, 3) next turn:  \nDOWN (5, 2) empty  \nUP (5, 4) empty  \nLEFT (4, 3) my body \u2192 unsafe  \nRIGHT (6, 3) empty  \nSo 3 safe moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Comparing:**  \nLEFT: gets apple (+1 score), but reduces open space slightly because body longer. Still okay.  \nUP: safe, keeps options open.  \nRIGHT: safe, keeps options open.  \n\nGiven enemy snake is far away, no immediate danger, and I want to maximize score while staying safe, eating apple now is good.  \n\nLEFT to (3, 3) also puts me closer to other apples like (2, 0), (4, 5), etc.  \n\nI think **LEFT** is best this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (3, 3) and eating apple, my length will be 4. Next turn my body: head (3, 3), then (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2). Possible moves: UP (3, 4), DOWN (3, 2), LEFT (2, 3) all safe. Avoid RIGHT into (4, 3) my neck. Then aim for nearest safe apple like (2, 0) or (4, 5), but watch enemy movement.  \n\nLEFT",

Yes, body has 3 segments after head, so total length 4.)  \n- Last move was LEFT to (3, 3), which had an apple, so I grew this turn.  \n\n**Apples nearby:**  \n- (0, 2), (2, 0), (0, 1), (4, 1), (1, 4), (4, 5), (0, 5), etc.  \n\n**Enemy snake #0:**  \n- Head at (8, 8), body [(7, 8), (7, 9)], length 3 (apples 2 \u2192 length 3), far away.  \n\n---\n\n**Possible moves from (3, 3):**  \n1. **UP** \u2192 (3, 4)  \n   - In bounds: yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n   - Safe.  \n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 2)  \n   - In bounds: yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n   - Safe.  \n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 3)  \n   - In bounds: yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n   - Safe.  \n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 3)  \n   - In bounds: yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? Yes! (4, 3) is my neck (second segment). Moving into own body \u2192 suicide.  \n   - Not safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Next, check for possible head-on collisions with enemy #0:**  \nEnemy head at (8, 8). Possible moves for enemy:  \n- UP \u2192 (8, 9)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 7)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 8) (its own body) \u2192 suicide for them, so they might avoid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 8)  \n\nNone of these are my possible next head positions (3, 4), (3, 2), (2, 3). So no head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Which safe move is best?**  \nGoal: increase score while staying safe.  \n\n- **UP (3, 4)**: moves toward center, closer to apple at (4, 5) and (1, 4).  \n- **DOWN (3, 2)**: moves toward apple at (2, 0) and (4, 1).  \n- **LEFT (2, 3)**: moves toward apple at (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 5).  \n\nCheck future options after each:  \n\n**After UP to (3, 4)**:  \nNext turn possible moves:  \nUP (3, 5) empty, DOWN (3, 3) my current head position \u2192 will be empty next turn (since body shifts), LEFT (2, 4) empty, RIGHT (4, 4) empty. So 4 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**After DOWN to (3, 2)**:  \nNext turn possible moves:  \nUP (3, 3) empty, DOWN (3, 1) empty, LEFT (2, 2) empty, RIGHT (4, 2) my body? Let's track body shift:  \nCurrent body: (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2). If I move DOWN to (3, 2), new head (3, 2), body becomes [(3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2)], tail (5, 2) disappears. So (4, 2) is my last body segment next turn. So RIGHT (4, 2) is occupied by my body \u2192 unsafe next turn. So from (3, 2) next turn, 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n\n**After LEFT to (2, 3)**:  \nNext turn possible moves:  \nUP (2, 4) empty, DOWN (2, 2) empty, LEFT (1, 3) empty, RIGHT (3, 3) empty (old head position, now empty). So 4 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Closest apples:**  \n- (4, 5) dist from (3, 3) = |4-3| + |5-3| = 1 + 2 = 3  \n- (2, 0) dist = |2-3| + |0-3| = 1 + 3 = 4  \n- (0, 2) dist = 3 + 1 = 4  \n- (1, 4) dist = 2 + 1 = 3  \n\nFrom (3, 4): closer to (4, 5) (dist 2) and (1, 4) (dist 2).  \nFrom (2, 3): closer to (0, 2) (dist 3) and (0, 1) (dist 4).  \nFrom (3, 2): closer to (2, 0) (dist 3) and (4, 1) (dist 2).  \n\nAll have nearby apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term planning:**  \nEnemy is far, so no immediate threat. Need to keep space. UP and LEFT give 4 safe moves next turn, DOWN gives 3. So prefer UP or LEFT.  \n\nLEFT goes toward left edge, which could limit space later, but board has many apples there. UP goes more central, better for flexibility.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose **UP** to stay central and keep more options.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 4), aim for (4, 5) or (1, 4), but check enemy movement. Keep avoiding own body.  \n\nUP",

LEFT goes toward left edge, which could limit space long-term but has apples.  \nGiven enemy far away, central positioning is better for flexibility.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose **UP** to aim for (4, 5) next turn while keeping maximum options.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 5), consider moving RIGHT to (4, 5) to eat apple if safe, or continue UP/LEFT to avoid potential traps.

Yes, (9, 8) is their second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 6) safe (empty).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 7) safe (empty).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (10, 7) safe (empty).  \nSo enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nHead-on collision check:  \nMy possible head positions next turn: (3, 6), (2, 5), (4, 5).  \nEnemy possible head positions: (9, 6), (8, 7), (10, 7).  \nNo overlap \u2192 no head-on risk.\n\n---\n\n**Next-turn safety for each move:**\n\nIf I move **UP** to (3, 6):  \nNext turn my body will be [(3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3)], tail (4, 3) gone.  \nFrom (3, 6): UP (3, 7) has apple, DOWN (3, 5) will be my body, LEFT (2, 6) empty, RIGHT (4, 6) empty.  \nSo DOWN unsafe \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (2, 5):  \nNext turn my body will be [(3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3)], tail (4, 3) gone.  \nFrom (2, 5): UP (2, 6) empty, DOWN (2, 4) empty, LEFT (1, 5) empty, RIGHT (3, 5) my body.  \nSo RIGHT unsafe \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (4, 5):  \nApple eaten \u2192 I grow to length 5, body becomes [(4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (4, 3)] \u2014 wait, careful: when eating, new head at apple, old body stays, tail stays? Actually:  \nSnake growth: new head at apple, previous head becomes new segment 2, body shifts, tail stays same length unless apple eaten. Since I eat apple, length increases by 1, so tail does **not** disappear. Current length 4, after eating apple length 5, so body: head (4, 5), then (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (4, 3).  \nFrom (4, 5) next turn: UP (4, 6) empty, DOWN (4, 4) empty, LEFT (3, 5) my body, RIGHT (5, 5) empty.  \nSo LEFT unsafe \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.\n\nSo all three safe moves give me 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apples to (3, 5):  \n- (4, 5) distance 1 (RIGHT) \u2014 immediate eat.  \n- (3, 7) distance 2 (UP twice).  \n- (6, 4) distance 3.  \n- (6, 5) distance 3.  \n- (1, 4) distance 3.  \n\nRIGHT gets apple immediately and is safe \u2014 good for score and growth. Risk: eating apple makes me longer, which could limit future mobility, but currently board is open.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy position:** Enemy far away (9, 7), not an immediate threat.\n\n**Edge considerations:**  \nRIGHT to (4, 5) keeps me central. UP or LEFT keep me near left edge but still okay.\n\nGiven the goal to collect apples safely, RIGHT to (4, 5) is appealing because:\n1. It\u2019s safe now.\n2. It gives +1 apple, extending lead if enemy hasn\u2019t eaten.\n3. Future options from (4, 5) still reasonable (3 safe moves).\n\nUP to (3, 6) avoids growth but delays eating. Since growth is needed to win (30 apples), eating now is good.\n\nLEFT to (2, 5) moves away from many apples toward left edge.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn after RIGHT:**  \nFrom (4, 5) after eating apple:  \n- Avoid moving into own body at (3, 5).  \n- Possible moves UP to (4, 6) or DOWN to (4, 4) or RIGHT to (5, 5).  \n- Choose whichever is safest and heads toward next apple ((3, 7) or (6, 4/5)).  \n\nGiven all, I\u2019ll take the apple.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "DOWN **START RATIONALE**  \nThe snake's head is at (9,7) with the next body segment at (9,8). Moving UP would collide with the body. RIGHT leads toward the distant apple at (10,5), but lacks immediate access. DOWN moves toward Y=6, which may offer paths to apples like (10,5) or (9,6-specific apples). However, LEFT moves toward (3,7) apple. Wait, the (3,7) apple is directly left in the same Y row. The user's head is at (9,7), so moving LEFT would start approaching (3,7). But the distance is 6 cells left. However, the apple at (3,7) is closer in Y than others like (10,5). Also, the enemy snake's head is at (3,5), nearby. If enemy moves UP, their head to (3,6), which isn't a conflict. Prioritize moving LEFT to collect (3,7). Wait, no. Let's recalculate. The apple (3,7) is at same Y as head (Y=7), X=3. To reach it, snake must move LEFT 6 times. But current move options are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Moving LEFT now starts heading toward it, but it's 6 steps left. The apple at (10,5) is 1 right and 2 down. Which apple is closer? Manhattan distance: (10,5) is (9-10)+(7-5)=1+2=3. (3,7): (9-3)+(0)=6. So (10,5) is closer. But moving RIGHT first allows stepping toward (10,5). However, moving DOWN initially could allow turning RIGHT next turn. Also, the apple at (10,5) is 2 down from (9,7)'s Y=7 (wait no, (10,5) is at Y=5). Wait head is at Y=7. To go to (10,5), delta is +1 X (right) and -2 Y (down). So RIGHT then DOWN twice. So RIGHT movement is better here. Wait, the Y=5 is row 5. The snake's current position is (9,7). Moving RIGHT to (10,7), then DOWN to (10,6), then DOWN to (10,5) to collect the apple. Each move needs to be safe. The DOWN steps would need to check for collisions. Alternatively, the apple at (3,7) is in same row but much further. So RIGHT first seems better. However, the current move DOWN would not interfere with any immediate head-on collisions. Wait, confusion arises. Let's clarify. The apple at (10,5) is located at X=10, Y=5. The user's head is at (9,7). The Manhattan distance is |9-10| + |7-5| = 1 + 2 = 3. The apple at (3,7) has distance |9-3| + |7-7| = 6 + 0 = 6. The apple (6,5) is at X=6, Y=5: distance |9-6| + |7-5|= 3+2=5. So the closest apple is (10,5). Therefore, RIGHT move to approach it. Also, the user's snake can then proceed down in the following turns. However, the user's current snake's body after moving RIGHT would be (10,7), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8). To collect (10,5), need to move down twice. But during each move, ensure the path is safe. Also, need to check if enemy snake could block. Since it's risky, but better than LEFT's distant apple. Alternatively, is there any other apple nearby? Looking at the board's row Y=5 (line labeled 5): \"5 A . . 1 A . A . . . A .\". So X=0, Y=5: apple. X=10 has an A at Y=1 (10,1). Not close. Wait, the apple at (10,5) is listed. Let me check again. Yes, the apple at (10,5) exists. So RIGHT is a good move to approach it. However, the cell (10,7) must be safe. Odds are it's empty. Therefore, the conclusion is to move DOWN to get closer to some apples below, but no. Wait, no. Wait (10,5) is two steps down from (9,7). But moving DOWN first would take the snake to (9,6), then RIGHT to 10,6, etc. Hmm. Maybe moving DOWN first isn't the best. I'm confused. Let me recheck directions. Wait, the coordinates are (X,Y), with Y decreasing downward. So moving DOWN means increasing Y (since bottom is Y=0 up to Y=11). Wait no! Wait the problem states: \"decreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right. Decreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\" Wait no! The problem says: \"Decreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\" Wait wait: original problem says: \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (11,11) at top right. [...] Decreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\" Therefore, Y increases upward. So Y=0 is bottom, Y=11 is top. Therefore, moving DOWN would decrease Y. Wait, no: movement direction. If you move DOWN, you are moving from a higher Y to a lower Y? No, wait. If Y=0 is bottom, increasing Y goes up. So moving UP increases Y, moving DOWN decreases Y. Wait, no: If the snake is at (x,y), moving DOWN would decrease Y by 1 (since going down from higher to lower Y). For example, moving DOWN from (x,5) would go to (x,4). But according to the problem's description: \"Decreasing your y coordinate is down\". So when the snake moves DOWN, Y decreases. This is critical. Therefore, moving DOWN from (9,7) would go to (9,6) (Y=6, which is lower). So the coordinates have the usual Y=0 at bottom, up to Y=11. Therefore:\n\n- UP direction: Y increases (moving upward)\n- DOWN direction: Y decreases (moving downward)\n- LEFT direction: X decreases\n- RIGHT direction: X increases\n\nThis is critical. The initial snake's head is at (9,7). So moving DOWN would take it to (9,6). Moving UP to (9,8), but that's where the second body segment is. So UP is invalid.\n\nSo the possible moves are DOWN (to Y=6), LEFT (to X=8), RIGHT (to X=10). \n\nLooking for the apple at (10,5) which is at X=10, Y=5. To reach this from (9,7), the path would require RIGHT then DOWN twice. \n\nApple (3,7) is at X=3, Y=7: same row. To get there, need to move LEFT 6 times from (9,7). The apple (6,5) is at X=6, Y=5. Distance from (9,7) is 3 left and 2 down.\n\nBut the closest apple in terms of Manhattan distance is (10,5) at distance 3. However, (10,5) is two steps down from the current Y=7. So moving RIGHT first would be moving towards X=10, then need to move down. But what if after moving RIGHT, the snake can then down. \n\nThe DOWN option: moving to (9,6). The apple at (4,5) is further left and down. Not immediately accessible. But moving DOWN now might start heading towards some apples. However, since the user's last move was DOWN, and they were at (9,8) before, the body is moving downward. Continuing this direction might be part of a strategy to head downward towards nearby apples. \n\nNow, the board's Y=5 (line labeled 5) has an apple at X=0 (apple (0,5)) and X=4 (apple (4,5)), X=6 (apple (6,5)), (6,4). If the snake moves DOWN to Y=6 (current move), then in subsequent moves, possible paths to those apples can be considered. \n\nAlternative strategy: prioritize apples that are reachable with minimal turns. For example, the apple at (6,5) and (6,4) are in column X=6. To reach them, the snake could go left. The head is at X=9, Y=7. Moving left toward X=6. Each LEFT move reduces X by 1. \n\nBut each move has risks, especially with enemy snakes and self collision.\n\nGiven the options, RIGHT seems to allow progress toward the (10,5) apple, which is closest. Moving RIGHT to (10,7) starts this path. Even though it takes two more down moves, it's closer than others. \n\nAlternatively, if the snake moves DOWN to (9,6), and then RIGHT in subsequent moves to reach (10,5), that's also possible. \n\nBut considering the possibilities of other snakes' movements, encouraging the use of RIGHT could increase the chance of eating apples quickly. If both players move towards the same apple, collisions are possible, but the main focus is the user's snake. \n\nAdditionally, the user's snake has started moving DOWN in the previous turn. Continuing DOWN could be part of a downward trajectory. However, the options are dynamic.\n\nThe main priority is to avoid a move that leads to certain death first. All options are safe based on immediate checks. So the next move must be the one that best positions for future apples.\n\nReiterating:\n\n- RIGHT leads toward (10,5), which is 1 right and 2 down. \n- LEFT moves toward (3,7), but longer distance.\n- DOWN starts heading down with no immediate apple benefit but could set up path for other apples.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal choice is RIGHT to initiate approach to the (10,5) apple. Hence, the move should be RIGHT.\n\nWait wait, but wait! The apple at (10,5) is at (X=10, Y=5). So from current (9,7), moving RIGHT to (10,7), then next move down to (10,6), then down again to (10,5). But if another apple exists at (4,11), but that's besides the point. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (6,5) is to the left, but the user's snake can't reach it in a single move.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is RIGHT to start moving towards the closest apple. \n\nFinal answer: RIGHT. \n\nWait another thought: (9,7) moving RIGHT to (10,7). Does that interfere with any enemy's body? Snake #1's body is at (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (4,3). Not conflicting. Also, the board's Y=7 line has an apple at (3,7). Other enemy snakes might have tails there, but not according to the info. So RIGHT should be safe.\nDOWN",

No  \n   - Enemy body? No  \n\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (4, 5)**  \n   - My body? Yes, that\u2019s my neck segment \u2192 suicide \u2192 not safe.  \n\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (3, 6)**  \n   - In bounds: yes  \n   - My body? No  \n   - Enemy body? No  \n\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (5, 6)**  \n   - In bounds: yes  \n   - My body? No  \n   - Enemy body? No  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Next-turn safety check** (considering my tail will move away from (3, 3) if I don\u2019t eat an apple):  \nCurrent body length = 5 segments. No apple eaten \u2192 tail moves off (3, 3) next turn, freeing that cell.  \n\nFrom each safe move:  \n\n- **UP to (4, 7):**  \n  Next turn body: [(4, 6), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4)]  \n  From (4, 7): UP(4,8), DOWN(4,6) my body, LEFT(3,7) apple?, RIGHT(5,7) free \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n- **LEFT to (3, 6):**  \n  Next turn body: [(4, 6), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4)]  \n  From (3, 6): UP(3,7) apple?, DOWN(3,5) my body, LEFT(2,6) free, RIGHT(4,6) my body \u2192 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n- **RIGHT to (5, 6):**  \n  Next turn body: [(4, 6), (4, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4)]  \n  From (5, 6): UP(5,7) free, DOWN(5,5) free, LEFT(4,6) my body, RIGHT(6,6) free \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nSo LEFT is slightly riskier (only 2 safe moves next turn).  \n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n- UP(4,7): gets closer to (3,7) apple (1 step left from there) and (4,11), (4,10) far up.  \n- LEFT(3,6): gets closer to (3,7) apple (1 step up from there), also (1,4), (0,5) further left.  \n- RIGHT(5,6): gets closer to (6,5) and (6,4) apples (1 step down-right next).  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy snake possible moves from (10, 6):**  \nSafe moves for enemy:  \n- UP(10,7) free  \n- DOWN(10,5) apple  \n- LEFT(9,6) own body? Wait, enemy body: [(9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)] \u2192 so (9, 6) is occupied by enemy\u2019s own body \u2192 so LEFT into (9, 6) is not safe for enemy.  \n- RIGHT(11,6) free.  \n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nMy possible heads next turn: (4,7), (3,6), (5,6)  \nEnemy possible heads: (10,7), (10,5), (11,6)  \nNo overlap \u2192 no head-on risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019m leading in apples (4 vs 3). Avoid risk, keep options open.  \nLEFT gives fewer next-move options. UP or RIGHT both give 3 safe moves next turn.  \nUP goes toward board center and near apple (3,7).  \nRIGHT goes toward right side but near apples (6,5) and (6,4).  \n\nEnemy is far right, so moving right gets slightly closer but still far.  \nI\u2019ll go UP to stay central and approach (3,7) apple next turn.  \n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP",

Possible moves from (2, 7):**  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 8)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 6)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 7)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 7)  \n\n---\n\n**2. Eliminate deadly moves:**  \n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (3, 7)** \u2192 This is my own body segment (second segment after head). Immediate death \u2192 **eliminated**.  \n\n**UP \u2192 (2, 8)** \u2192 Empty on board. No self-collision (my body: none at (2,8)). No enemy body there. Enemy head at (8,5), far away. Safe.  \n\n**DOWN \u2192 (2, 6)** \u2192 Empty on board. No self-collision. Safe.  \n\n**LEFT \u2192 (1, 7)** \u2192 Empty on board. No self-collision. Safe.  \n\nSo UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Consider enemy head movement and possible head-on collisions:**  \n\nEnemy head at (8, 5). Possible moves for enemy:  \n- UP \u2192 (8, 6)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 4)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 5)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 5) (but (9,5) is enemy body \u2192 not safe for enemy)  \n\nEnemy might avoid its own body at (9,5), so maybe UP, DOWN, LEFT are enemy\u2019s safe moves.  \n\nMy (1, 7) is far from enemy\u2019s possible moves.  \nMy (2, 6) is far from enemy\u2019s possible moves.  \nMy (2, 8) is far from enemy\u2019s possible moves.  \n\nNo risk of head-on collision this turn regardless.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Future options after each move:**  \n\n**UP to (2, 8)**:  \nFrom (2, 8): possible moves: UP to (2, 9) \u2013 empty; DOWN to (2, 7) \u2013 empty now (but body will be there next turn? Let\u2019s check: after moving UP, body becomes [(2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5)] \u2014 wait, no growth unless I eat apple. I didn\u2019t eat apple this turn, so length stays same, tail moves from (3,5) to (4,5)? Actually let\u2019s track: current body: head (2,7), body segments: (3,7), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5) tail. Moving UP: new head (2,8), then body becomes [(2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5)] \u2014 tail (3,5) disappears. So next turn, (2,7) is my body, so DOWN from (2,8) would be into my own body \u2192 not safe next turn. So from (2,8), DOWN blocked, LEFT to (1,8) open, RIGHT to (3,8) open, UP to (2,9) open. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**DOWN to (2, 6)**:  \nFrom (2, 6): body next turn: [(2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5)] \u2014 tail (3,5) gone.  \nMoves from (2,6): UP to (2,7) \u2192 body \u2192 dead next turn. DOWN to (2,5) empty, LEFT to (1,6) empty, RIGHT to (3,6) empty. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**LEFT to (1, 7)**:  \nFrom (1, 7): body next turn: [(2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5)]  \nMoves from (1,7): UP to (1,8) empty, DOWN to (1,6) empty, LEFT to (0,7) empty, RIGHT to (2,7) \u2192 body \u2192 dead. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nAll three safe moves give 3 options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Apple proximity:**  \n\nFrom (2,7):  \n- UP (2,8): closest apples: (1,9) dist 2, (0,5) dist 4, (1,4) dist 5.  \n- DOWN (2,6): closest apples: (1,4) dist 3, (0,5) dist 4, (6,5) dist 4.  \n- LEFT (1,7): closest apples: (1,9) dist 2, (0,5) dist 3, (1,4) dist 3, (1,2) dist 5.  \n\nLEFT puts me closer to multiple apples: (1,9) above, (0,5) below-left, (1,4) below, (1,2) far below. Good cluster on left side.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Avoid trapping:**  \n\nLEFT to (1,7) keeps me near left edge but not too constrained; I can go up/down/left next turn.  \n\nUP to (2,8) also fine but further from apple cluster.  \n\nDOWN to (2,6) also fine but away from left-side apples.  \n\nGiven last turn rationale said \u201cContinuing left aligns with previous plan to target apples on left side,\u201d and I just moved LEFT last turn, continuing LEFT again might be good if safe.  \n\nCheck: Last turn head was (3,7), moved LEFT to (2,7). Now at (2,7), LEFT to (1,7) continues leftward toward apples (1,9) etc.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nMove toward left-side apples (1,9), (0,5), (1,4), while staying safe from enemy who is far right. Keep options open by not hugging walls unnecessarily.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Safe.  \n- **DOWN (1, 6)** \u2192 Empty on board, safe.  \n- **LEFT (0, 7)** \u2192 Empty on board, safe.  \n\nSo UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy head movement and head-on collision risk**  \nEnemy head at (8, 4). Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (8, 5) (enemy\u2019s own body) \u2192 deadly for enemy.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 3) (empty)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 4) (apple at (7, 4) actually, but no snake there)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 4) (empty)  \n\nEnemy\u2019s safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nMy positions after my possible moves:  \n- UP (1, 8) \u2013 far from enemy\u2019s possible heads.  \n- DOWN (1, 6) \u2013 far.  \n- LEFT (0, 7) \u2013 far.  \n\nNo risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (0,2), (2,0), (0,1), (4,1), (1,4), (4,11), (4,10), (6,4), (6,5), (0,5), (1,9), (10,1), (1,2), (7,4), (9,8)  \n\nFrom (1, 7):  \n- UP (1, 8) \u2192 closest apple: (1, 9) distance 1. Very attractive.  \n- DOWN (1, 6) \u2192 closest apples: (1, 4) distance 2, (0, 5) distance 3.  \n- LEFT (0, 7) \u2192 closest apples: (0, 5) distance 2, (0, 2) far, (0, 1) far.  \n\nUP gets me to (1, 9) apple in one move. That\u2019s the closest apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future options after each safe move**  \n\n**UP to (1, 8):**  \nNext turn body: [(1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6)] (tail (4, 5) disappears).  \nFrom (1, 8):  \n- UP (1, 9) \u2192 apple, safe unless enemy gets there same time? Enemy at (8,4) can\u2019t reach (1,9) in 1 move.  \n- DOWN (1, 7) \u2192 my body next turn \u2192 deadly.  \n- LEFT (0, 8) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (2, 8) \u2192 empty.  \nSo next turn: 3 safe moves if I eat apple (grow), 2 safe if I don\u2019t? Wait, if I eat apple at (1,9), length grows by 1, so body becomes [(1,8), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (4,6)], tail (4,5) gone, so DOWN from (1,9) would be (1,8) which is body \u2192 deadly. So after eating, from (1,9) I\u2019d have LEFT, RIGHT, UP safe. Still fine.  \n\n**DOWN to (1, 6):**  \nBody next turn: [(1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6)]  \nFrom (1, 6): UP (1, 7) body \u2192 deadly, DOWN (1,5) empty, LEFT (0,6) empty, RIGHT (2,6) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n**LEFT to (0, 7):**  \nBody next turn: [(1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6)]  \nFrom (0, 7): UP (0,8) empty, DOWN (0,6) empty, LEFT off board \u2192 deadly, RIGHT (1,7) body \u2192 deadly \u2192 only 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN). Worse.  \n\nSo LEFT reduces future options (traps against left wall).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP gets apple (1, 9) next turn, increases my lead (6 apples vs enemy\u2019s 4), keeps decent future options.  \nDOWN keeps options but no immediate apple.  \nLEFT reduces options.  \n\nBest choice: **UP** to grab apple and maintain momentum.  \n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nAfter eating (1,9), consider moving toward (0,5) or (1,4) while avoiding wall traps.

Here's the breakdown of the situation:\n\n### Current Position and Constraints\n- **Head Location:** (10, 1)\n- **Body Segments:** [(10,2), (9,2), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4)]\n- **Available Apples:** (0,2), (2,0), (0,1), (4,1), (1,4), (4,11), (4,10), (6,4), (6,5), (0,5), (1,2), (7,4), (9,8), (3,4), (1,11)\n- **Edgy Positioning:** The snake is near the top-left of the board and must avoid its own body and enemy snakes.\n\n### Collision Analysis\n- **UP:** Would move to (10,2), which is colliding with the first body segment. \u274c Invalid.\n- **DOWN:** Moves to (10,0), which is valid but does not lead to an apple and restricts upward mobility for the next turn. \ud83d\udc0d\n- **LEFT:** Moves to (9,1), which is safe and provides a path toward the nearby apple at (4,1). \u2705 Valid.\n- **RIGHT:** Moves to (11,1), which is valid but leads toward the board's edge and offers no immediate apples. \u2705 Valid but less strategic.\n\n### Strategic Evaluation\n- **LEFT** positions the snake toward the apple at (4,1) and provides flexibility for future moves (e.g., further leftward progress or upward paths). It avoids collisions and keeps the snake on target for an apple while maintaining path options.\n- **DOWN** avoids immediate danger but traps the snake in a downward trajectory, limiting future movement options.\n- **RIGHT** moves toward the edge but offers no apples or strategic advantage.\n\n### Conclusion\nPrioritizing apple acquisition and maintaining maneuverability, **LEFT** is the optimal choice. It aligns the snake with a nearby apple and avoids restrictive positioning.\n\nLEFT",

No immediate collision risk for me either way.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (1, 6):  \n- Next turn safe moves from (1, 6): UP (1, 7) will be empty (tail moves), DOWN (1, 5) empty, LEFT (0, 6) empty, RIGHT (2, 6) empty. All four could be safe if tail moves away from (0, 7). That gives flexibility.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 7):  \n- Next turn safe moves from (2, 7): UP (2, 8) empty, DOWN (2, 6) empty, LEFT (1, 7) empty, RIGHT (3, 7) empty. Also all four could be safe.  \n\nBoth safe moves keep options open.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nMy body is along left edge (x=0) and top-left corner. I need to avoid trapping myself there. Moving RIGHT opens central board and gives more room. But moving DOWN gets me closer to apple (1, 4), and also apple (0, 5) is nearby.  \nApple (1, 4) is reachable in 3 moves if I go DOWN now: (1, 7) \u2192 (1, 6) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (1, 4).  \nApple (0, 5) is reachable in 3 moves: (1, 7) \u2192 (1, 6) \u2192 (0, 6) \u2192 (0, 5).  \nBoth are safe routes.  \n\nEnemy is far away (bottom right), so no immediate threat.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nI prefer DOWN because it puts me closer to two apples quickly and keeps future options open (from (1, 6) I can go left, right, down, or even back up). Going RIGHT keeps me farther from apples.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 6), consider moving DOWN toward (1, 5) to continue toward apple (1, 4), or LEFT to (0, 6) to approach apple (0, 5). Keep checking enemy movement but they are distant. Avoid moving into my own body as tail advances.  \n\nDOWN",

Wait, check: my body order is head first, tail last. After my move, the whole snake shifts forward; segment at (1, 7) moves to where head was? Actually, in Snake mechanics: when I move, the head goes to new cell, each body segment moves into the previous segment's old position, the tail segment is removed unless I eat an apple. Currently (1, 7) is my first body segment after head. If I move UP back into (1, 7), that cell will be vacated by that segment moving into (1, 6) (old head position), so (1, 7) becomes empty. But moving backwards into your own body is deadly regardless? Rule says: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" Here, my neck is at (1, 7) (directly behind head), so moving UP into (1, 7) is moving backwards into my own body \u2192 deadly. So UP is unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 empty on board  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 6) \u2192 empty on board  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 6) \u2192 empty on board  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Immediate apple proximity:**  \nClosest apples from (1, 6):  \n- (1, 4) distance 2 (DOWN twice)  \n- (0, 5) distance 2 (LEFT then DOWN or DOWN then LEFT)  \n- (1, 2) distance 4  \n- (0, 2), (0, 1), (2, 0), (4, 1), (3, 4), etc. farther.  \n\nDOWN gets me closer to (1, 4) fastest.  \nLEFT gets me closer to (0, 5) and (0, 2).  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Enemy risk:**  \nEnemy at (9, 0) is far away, no immediate collision risk.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options after each safe move:**  \nFrom (1, 5): safe moves likely DOWN to (1, 4) (apple), LEFT to (0, 5) (apple), RIGHT to (2, 5), UP to (1, 6) (old head, now empty). Good options.  \nFrom (0, 6): safe moves likely DOWN to (0, 5) (apple), RIGHT to (1, 6) (empty), UP to (0, 7) (my body? after move, (0, 7) will be occupied by segment from (0, 8)? Wait, my body after moving LEFT: head at (0, 6), body segments shift: old (1, 6) becomes new segment at (0, 6)? No, let's simulate: current body: head (1, 6), then (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (1, 10). If I move LEFT to (0, 6), new head (0, 6), then body: (1, 6), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10). So (0, 7) is still occupied by a body segment. So from (0, 6), UP to (0, 7) would be deadly next turn. DOWN to (0, 5) apple, RIGHT to (1, 6) empty. So two safe moves from (0, 6).  \nFrom (2, 6): safe moves likely DOWN to (2, 5), LEFT to (1, 6), RIGHT to (3, 6), UP to (2, 7). All likely safe.  \n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT keep more future safe moves than LEFT.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nMy body is along left edge and top edge; moving DOWN keeps me near left side but opens central area. Moving RIGHT takes me toward center and more apples later. Moving LEFT keeps me near left edge but risks trapping later if I go up into my body.  \n\nI want to eat apples quickly to gain length lead over enemy (6 vs 5). Closest apples: (1, 4) and (0, 5).  \nDOWN to (1, 5) sets up to eat (1, 4) next turn if I go DOWN again, but need to check if (1, 4) is safe: enemy far, no snake body there.  \nLEFT to (0, 6) sets up to eat (0, 5) next turn if I go DOWN.  \n\nBoth are good. But DOWN gives more future flexibility after eating apple (1, 4): from (1, 4) I can go LEFT to (0, 4) or RIGHT to (2, 4) etc.  \nLEFT to (0, 6) then DOWN to (0, 5) apple then I'm at bottom left corner with fewer exits.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nI'll choose DOWN to (1, 5) to aim for apple (1, 4) next turn, keeping options open.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 5), consider moving DOWN to (1, 4) to eat apple if still there, else maybe LEFT to (0, 5) for that apple. Check enemy movement, but they are distant. Avoid moving back into own body.\n\nDOWN",

However, moving UP goes into the cell directly behind my head (neck at (1, 6)), which is moving backwards into my own body \u2192 deadly. **Unsafe.**  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 4) \u2192 apple present. Not occupied by any snake body. Safe if no head-on collision? Enemy far away.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 5) \u2192 apple present. Not occupied by any snake body. Safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 5) \u2192 empty, no apple, no snake body. Safe.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Check for immediate dangers:**  \n- DOWN to (1, 4): Enemy head at (10, 0) cannot reach (1, 4) in one move. No other snake.  \n- LEFT to (0, 5): Similarly safe from enemy.  \n- RIGHT to (2, 5): Safe.  \n\nAll three moves are safe immediately.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future options after each safe move:**  \n- **DOWN to (1, 4)** \u2013 eat apple, grow to length 8. New body will extend tail by 1, so tail stays at (0, 10). From (1, 4): possible moves: UP (back to (1, 5) \u2013 now empty), DOWN to (1, 3) empty, LEFT to (0, 4) empty, RIGHT to (2, 4) empty. All four likely safe next turn. Good flexibility.  \n- **LEFT to (0, 5)** \u2013 eat apple, grow to length 8. From (0, 5): possible moves: UP to (0, 6) empty, DOWN to (0, 4) empty, RIGHT to (1, 5) empty (but careful: (1, 5) will be vacated by head moving away). Also safe options. However, (0, 5) is bottom-left corner area, could limit future movement if I go further left/down.  \n- **RIGHT to (2, 5)** \u2013 no apple. From (2, 5): possible moves: UP to (2, 6) empty, DOWN to (2, 4) empty, LEFT to (1, 5) empty, RIGHT to (3, 5) empty. All safe. But not eating apple this turn means enemy could eat one instead, closing the gap (they have 5 vs my 6).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity and scoring:**  \nClosest apples from (1, 5): (1, 4) distance 1, (0, 5) distance 1. Eating either gives me 7 apples, enemy still at 5. That extends my lead.  \nChoosing DOWN or LEFT gets an apple now. RIGHT delays eating.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy at (10, 0) has possible moves: UP to (10, 1) \u2013 occupied by its own body segment (10, 1) \u2192 deadly. DOWN off board \u2192 deadly. LEFT to (9, 0) \u2013 occupied by its own body \u2192 deadly. RIGHT to (11, 0) \u2013 empty. So enemy likely forced RIGHT to (11, 0). That moves them away from apples near them: (2, 0), (4, 1), etc. So they won\u2019t eat an apple this turn probably.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nMy body is along left and top edges. Moving DOWN to (1, 4) keeps me central-left with many apples nearby: (0, 2), (0, 1), (1, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), etc.  \nMoving LEFT to (0, 5) also good but may push me into bottom-left corner where exits are limited after growth.  \nI want to maintain flexibility and keep eating apples safely.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN to (1, 4) gives me an apple now, keeps four exits next turn, and positions me well for future apples.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 4) after eating apple, length 8, tail at (0, 10). Check moves: UP to (1, 5), DOWN to (1, 3), LEFT to (0, 4), RIGHT to (2, 4). All likely safe. Choose based on closest apples: (0, 2), (1, 2), (3, 4), etc. Avoid moving into enemy path if they come near.  \n\nDOWN",

Next turn from (1, 2): UP to (1, 3) unsafe (backwards into neck at (1, 3)? Wait, after moving DOWN to (1, 2), neck will be (1, 3) which will be occupied by old head position? No \u2014 after move, body becomes: head (1, 2), then (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9). So UP to (1, 3) is occupied by my body segment (second segment). So UP unsafe. DOWN to (1, 1) safe, LEFT to (0, 2) (apple), RIGHT to (2, 2) safe. Three safe moves, one leads to apple.  \n- **LEFT to (0, 3)**: No apple. Next turn from (0, 3): UP to (0, 4) safe, DOWN to (0, 2) (apple), RIGHT unsafe (backwards into (1, 3)), LEFT off-board. Two safe moves, one leads to apple.  \n- **RIGHT to (2, 3)**: No apple. Next turn from (2, 3): UP to (2, 4), DOWN to (2, 2), RIGHT to (3, 3) safe; LEFT unsafe (backwards into (1, 3)). Three safe moves, none directly onto apple but adjacent to (3, 4) apple.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nDOWN gives immediate apple (1, 2), increasing score to 8, lengthening to 9.  \nLEFT and RIGHT no immediate apple.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy prediction:**  \nEnemy at (10, 2) can go UP (10, 3), DOWN (10, 1) into its body? (10, 1) is its body segment \u2192 unsafe. LEFT (9, 2) safe, RIGHT (11, 2) safe. Likely moves toward center or apples on right side. No immediate threat to our area.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nEating apple now extends lead to 8 vs 5.  \nDOWN \u2192 then next turn can go LEFT to (0, 2) apple or DOWN to (1, 1) exploring bottom-left apple cluster.  \nLEFT \u2192 fewer exits next turn (only two), but then can eat (0, 2) apple after (0, 3) move.  \nRIGHT \u2192 more central, closer to enemy later.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nEating apple now is beneficial \u2014 extends lead, grows longer (more survivability), and safe. DOWN to (1, 2) is safe and gets apple.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 2), prioritize LEFT to (0, 2) apple if safe, else DOWN to (1, 1) to avoid dead ends. Avoid UP (backwards into neck). Keep moving toward bottom-left apples to stay away from enemy.  \n\nDOWN",

The immediate priority is to avoid self-collisions and collisions with Snake #1 while positioning for optimal apple access. \n\n**Analysis of Move Options:**\n- **UP:** Moves toward higher y-values, approaching apples at (4,10/11) and (6,4/5). Safe from own-body collisions (new head (10,3) not in current body). Avoids Snake #1's horizontal path (x=0-1, y=3-9). Minimally confines growth in vertical direction, preserving mobility.\n- **DOWN:** Collides with own body (head moves to (10,1), a current body segment). Invalid.\n- **LEFT:** New head (9,2) avoids immediate own-body collision, but positions toward enemy Snake #1's vicinity (x=0-1). Increasing risk of future collisions if Snake #1 shifts horizontally. Also, closer proximity to Snake #1's vertical body raises collision chances if they turn right.\n- **RIGHT:** Heads toward edge (x=11), limiting future rightward movement. Remote from nearest apples (e.g., (4,10/11)). \n\n**Decision Rationale:**  \nUP maximizes optimal positioning: it avoids immediate collisions, maintains upward momentum toward higher-value apples, and minimizes risk of engagements with Snake #1's vertical body. By continuing vertical growth, subsequent moves can pivot leftward to pursue apples like (6,4) or (4,10) while reducing exposure to enemies. \n\n**Long-term plan:** Continue prioritizing vertical movement upward to secure central map control, then pivoting softly left to intercept milestones like (4,10) or (6,4). Avoid overextending toward edges (x=0 or x=11) to retain flexibility. Snake #1's higher apple count (7 vs. 5) pressures vulnerability; efficient state scaling remains critical. \n\n**Final Decision:**  \nUP",

From (0, 1), go RIGHT to (1, 1) next turn to maintain mobility. Then move toward (2, 0) via (1, 0) or (2, 1). Avoid trapping myself on the left edge. Monitor enemy movement and stay away from right side apples until necessary.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (0, 1), prioritize RIGHT to (1, 1) to keep two safe moves available. Then evaluate moves toward (2, 0) or (4, 1) while ensuring an escape route.  \n\nDOWN",

However, this traps the snake in a narrow column.\n   - **LEFT** moves toward x=9, closer to central apples like (7,4) but risks exposure to enemy movements.\n   - **RIGHT** advances toward the edge (x=11), positioning the snake near the apple at (11,11), which requires upward movement. This direction avoids the left-side snake and opens central access.\n\n4. **Long-Term Plan**: Prioritize RIGHT to exploit the right-side apples, then pursue upward movement for (11,11). This avoids conflict with the left-side enemy and uses spatial advantage.\n\n**Move:** RIGHT",
