UP keeps center but is less directly aimed at a nearby apple. DOWN is both safe and goal-directed while preserving mobility.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Move toward (8,5) and take it if safe.

(1,9) is farther (distance 7), while right-side apples are out of reach soon and could be contested.\n- Last rationale highlighted approaching (1,7) or (0,6) safely via LEFT then UP, which aligns with keeping multiple options, avoiding traps (going DOWN or RIGHT feels like closing space), and gaining ground without head-on risks.\n\nPlan for next 2-3 turns: Move LEFT to (1,3) to position centrally near apples without committing. Reassess from there\u2014UP toward (1,7) seems safest if enemy stays away, or pivot LEFT/US DOWN if (0,6) is clearer.

UP and RIGHT both reduce distance to 3; LEFT increases it.\n- UP keeps me more central (x=7) giving good future maneuverability; RIGHT moves me toward the right wall sooner (x=8).\n\nFollow-up move options:\n- From (7,7) I still have at least three forward options (except the immediate backwards), giving better escape flexibility.\n- From (8,6) I'd be closer to the wall which slightly reduces lateral flexibility.\n\nShort plan:\n- Continue toward the top-right apple at (8,9) while preserving multiple escape routes. After reaching or securing that apple, reassess and avoid getting trapped along the right wall; prefer moves that keep 2\u20133 follow-up options open.\n\nDecision:\nUP",
