Moving UP to (2, 8) would cause a head-on collision (both die). So I'm left with DOWN to (2, 6), LEFT to (1, 7), or RIGHT to (3, 7).\n\nLooking at the apple positions, the closest apple is (1, 3) at distance 5. To get closer to it, I should move LEFT to (1, 7), and then I can move DOWN to (1, 6), (1, 5), etc., to get closer to the apple at (1, 3).\n\nMoving LEFT keeps me safe and positions me well to reach the nearest apple while avoiding the enemy.\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to (1, 7), then continue moving towards the apple at (1, 3) while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nLEFT",
