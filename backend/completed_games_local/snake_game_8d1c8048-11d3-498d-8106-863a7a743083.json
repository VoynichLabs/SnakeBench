          "move": "RIGHT",
          "rationale": "There is no immediate threat from the enemy snake, as it is currently 2 units away and its head is at (3,3). I am at (1,1). If I move RIGHT to (2,1), the enemy could move RIGHT to (4,3) or UP to (3,4) or DOWN to (3,2). None of these put the enemy head at (2,1) or adjacent to me in a way that threatens collision on the next turn (enemy must move into my head or body to kill itself, or meet head-on). The enemy cannot reach (2,1) in one move because it is Manhattan distance 2. Thus, moving RIGHT is safe from immediate head-on collision.\n\nI should consider if there is a safer move. Moving DOWN to (1,0) is safe from immediate collision as well. However, moving DOWN takes me away from the apples located at (1,4) (which is 3 steps away if I go up later) and (2,2) (if I go diagonal, but I must go in cardinal directions). Moving RIGHT to (2,1) positions me closer to the apple at (1,4) (Manhattan distance 3 -> 2) and the apple at (2,2) (Manhattan distance 3 -> 1). It also moves me towards the cluster of apples at (4,8) and (6,6), although they are far.\n\nLet's verify safety of RIGHT to (2,1):\n- Coordinates: x=2, y=1. Inside board (0-9).\n- Own body: Currently (1,1) -> (2,1) is empty.\n- Enemy body: Empty.\n- Enemy head: (3,3). Distance to (2,1) is |3-2| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3. Safe.\n- Walls: No.\n\nLet's verify safety of UP to (1,2):\n- (1,2) is empty.\n- Distance to enemy: |3-1| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3. Safe.\n- Moves me towards apples (1,4) and (4,8). This is also a valid option.\n\nLet's verify safety of DOWN to (1,0):\n- (1,0) is empty.\n- Distance to enemy: |3-1| + |3-0| = 2 + 3 = 5. Safe.\n- Moves me away from the apples.\n\nLet's verify safety of LEFT to (0,1):\n- (0,1) is empty.\n- Distance to enemy: |3-0| + |3-1| = 3 + 2 = 5. Safe.\n- Moves me towards (0,0) corner, which is generally a trap. I should avoid LEFT.\n\nSo, UP and RIGHT are good options. RIGHT moves me towards the immediate low-hanging fruit at (2,2) (effectively) and keeps me in the general area of other apples. UP moves me towards (1,4). (2,2) is reachable in 1 move if I go RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT. Since I am at (1,1), if I go RIGHT to (2,1), next turn I can go UP to (2,2). If I go UP to (1,2), next turn I can go RIGHT to (2,2).\n\nHowever, looking at the board, there is an apple at (9,9) which is far. There is an apple at (4,8). There is an apple at (6,6). There is an apple at (3,5). There is an apple at (1,4).\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,1), I am 1 move away from (2,2) (Manhattan 1). If I move UP to (1,2), I am 1 move away from (2,2) (Manhattan 1) and 2 moves from (1,4).\n\nIf I move RIGHT, my path is clear to (2,2). If I move UP, my path is clear to (1,2).\n\nIs there any reason to prefer one over the other? The enemy is at (3,3). If I go UP to (1,2), the enemy might move UP to (3,4) or LEFT to (2,3). If enemy goes LEFT to (2,3), it will be adjacent to me at (1,2). This is not immediately fatal unless the enemy moves into my head on the next turn (which it can't because it's 1 step away and I can move away). But it sets up a potential head-on collision if I move towards it.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1), and enemy goes LEFT to (2,3), distance is 2. If enemy goes DOWN to (3,2), distance is 1 (|2-3|+|1-2|=2). If enemy goes UP to (3,4), distance is 3. If enemy goes RIGHT to (4,3), distance is 3.\n\nActually, looking at the board state, there is an apple at (3,5). If the enemy is at (3,3), it is 2 steps away from (3,5). It is very likely the enemy will move UP to chase (3,5) or (4,8) eventually.\n\nLet's look at the board again:\nRow 9: A at (9,9).\nRow 8: A at (4,8).\nRow 6: A at (6,6).\nRow 5: A at (3,5).\nRow 1: A at (9,1).\nMy head: (1,1).\n\nIf I move UP to (1,2), I am moving towards (1,4) which is closer than (9,1). (1,4) is 2 steps away. (2,2) is 1 step away.\nActually, (1,4) is 3 steps away from (1,1). (2,2) is 2 steps away.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,1), I am moving towards (2,2) and (4,8).\nIf I move UP to (1,2), I am moving towards (1,4) and (4,8).\n\nLet's check if moving UP is safe regarding walls/future traps. (1,2) is near the left wall. (2,1) is slightly more central.\nAt (1,2), I can go RIGHT to (2,2), UP to (1,3), or LEFT to (0,2).\nAt (2,1), I can go RIGHT to (3,1), UP to (2,2), LEFT to (1,1) (tail, safe if I grow), or DOWN to (2,0).\n\nWait, if I move UP to (1,2), my tail will move from (1,1) to... wait, I haven't eaten. My tail is at (1,1) currently (since body is none, tail is head? No, body is none, so the snake is length 1. \"Body: none\" usually implies length 1, meaning head is the only segment. If I move, the tail disappears if I don't eat.\nActually, the prompt says: \"Body: none\" and \"Head: (1,1)\". Usually in Snake, a snake of length 1 has a head and no distinct body segments. When it moves, it leaves its previous position. If it doesn't eat, the tail effectively disappears from the old head position.\n\nIf I am length 1:\n- If I move UP to (1,2), I am at (1,2). The cell (1,1) becomes empty.\n- If I move RIGHT to (2,1), I am at (2,1). The cell (1,1) becomes empty.\n\nSo there is no \"backwards\" move restriction in the traditional sense (can't move into my body) because I have no body. The prompt says \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" Since I have no body, I cannot hit myself. But I can still hit walls or enemies.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT seem safe.\nWhy choose RIGHT?\nIt avoids the immediate left wall. (1,2) is very close to the wall.\nWhy choose UP?\nIt moves me towards the apple at (1,4) and (3,5). (3,5) is in the center. (4,8) is up.\nIf I go UP, I might collide with the enemy if it goes LEFT to (2,3). But that's the next turn.\n\nLet's look at the enemy head at (3,3).\nIf I go UP to (1,2), enemy can go UP to (3,4) or LEFT to (2,3).\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (2,3), I am at (1,2). They are at (2,3). They are adjacent. If I move towards them, collision.\nBut I can move UP to (1,3) or LEFT to (0,2) or RIGHT to (2,2). (2,2) is diagonal to (2,3), so no collision.\nSo it's manageable.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1), enemy can go LEFT to (2,3) or DOWN to (3,2).\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (2,3), I am at (2,1). Distance 2.\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (3,2), I am at (2,1). Distance 2.\n\nActually, let's consider the most valuable apple near me. (2,2) is 2 moves away. (1,4) is 3 moves away. (3,5) is 4 moves away.\nI should aim for (2,2).\nFrom (1,1), to get to (2,2) in 2 moves:\nPath 1: RIGHT -> (2,1), then UP -> (2,2).\nPath 2: UP -> (1,2), then RIGHT -> (2,2).\n\nBoth paths are equal length.\nIs there any immediate benefit to being at (2,1) vs (1,2)?\n(2,1) is x=2, y=1. (1,2) is x=1, y=2.\nThe enemy is at x=3, y=3.\nIf I am at (2,1), I am 1 step away from the apple at (2,2).\nIf I am at (1,2), I am 1 step away from (2,2).\nIf I am at (2,1), I am also 2 steps away from (4,8) (if I go RIGHT) or (3,5) (if I go RIGHT then UP). Actually, from (2,1), going UP to (2,2) then UP to (2,3) gets me closer to (3,5) and (4,8).\nIf I am at (1,2), going UP to (1,3) then UP to (1,4) gets me to (1,4). Then I can go RIGHT to (2,4).\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 5 has an apple at (3,5).\nRow 8 has an apple at (4,8).\nThese are higher value targets eventually.\nRight now, the immediate target is (2,2).\n\nIs there any reason to fear the enemy?\nThe enemy is at (3,3). It has an apple at (3,5) and (4,8) nearby. It is likely to move UP.\nIf it moves UP, it goes to (3,4).\nIf I am at (1,2), I am at (1,2). Distance to (3,4) is |1-3| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4. Safe.\nIf I am at (2,1), I am at (2,1). Distance to (3,4) is |2-3| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4. Safe.\n\nOkay, so both are safe from immediate head-on.\nLet's think about long term. I need to avoid getting boxed in.\n(1,2) is against the wall. If I go UP to (1,3), I am still against the wall. If I go UP to (1,4), I am at an apple.\n(2,1) is closer to the center. From (2,1) I can go UP to (2,2) or RIGHT to (3,1) (into the open).\nAlso, if I am at (1,2), I have to be careful not to get trapped by the wall and the enemy.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (2,3), I am at (1,2). I can go UP to (1,3) or DOWN to (1,1) or LEFT to (0,2).\nIf the enemy is at (2,3), it might move UP to (2,4) or DOWN to (2,2).\nIf it moves DOWN to (2,2), I cannot go to (2,2) on the next turn.\nBut I can go UP to (1,3).\nSo it's fine.\n\nHowever, if I am at (2,1) and the enemy moves LEFT to (2,3), I am safe.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (3,2), I am safe.\n\nLet's check if the enemy can reach my head in one turn if I move to (2,1).\nEnemy at (3,3). My head at (2,1).\nEnemy moves: UP to (3,4), DOWN to (3,2), LEFT to (2,3), RIGHT to (4,3).\nNone of these land on (2,1).\nDistance 2 minimum.\n\nLet's check if the enemy can reach my head in one turn if I move to (1,2).\nEnemy at (3,3).\nEnemy moves: UP (3,4), DOWN (3,2), LEFT (2,3), RIGHT (4,3).\nDistance to (1,2):\n(3,4): |3-1|+|4-2|=2+2=4\n(3,2): |3-1|+|2-2|=2+0=2\n(2,3): |2-1|+|3-2|=1+1=2\n(4,3): |4-1|+|3-2|=3+1=4\nSafe.\n\nSo both are safe.\n\nWhy choose UP?\nIt moves me directly towards the apple at (1,4) and (3,5). (1,4) is an apple. (3,5) is an apple.\nIf I go UP to (1,2), then UP to (1,3), then UP to (1,4) -> I eat (1,4). That's 3 moves.\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1), then UP to (2,2) (eat if it were there), then UP to (2,3), then UP to (2,4), then LEFT to (1,4) -> I eat (1,4) in 4 moves.\nWait, (2,2) is empty. There is no apple there.\nSo from (1,1) to (1,4):\nPath A: UP, UP, UP. (3 moves).\nPath B: RIGHT, UP, UP, LEFT. (4 moves).\n\nSo UP seems more direct towards the apple at (1,4).\nHowever, there is also an apple at (2,2)? No, look at the board.\nRow 2: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nRow 1: \" . 1 . . . . . . . A \"\nThere is no apple at (2,2). I misread the board or imagined it.\nApples are at: (9,1), (4,8), (6,6), (3,5), (9,9).\nThere is NO apple near me except (9,1) and (3,5).\n(1,4) is empty. (2,2) is empty.\nI need to re-evaluate.\nI am at (1,1). I have no apples nearby except (9,1) which is very far (x=9, y=1).\nAnd (3,5) which is closer (x=3, y=5).\nManhattan distance to (3,5) from (1,1) is |3-1| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6.\nManhattan distance to (4,8) is |4-1| + |8-1| = 3 + 7 = 10.\nManhattan distance to (6,6) is |6-1| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10.\nManhattan distance to (9,9) is |9-1| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16.\nManhattan distance to (9,1) is |9-1| + |1-1| = 8 + 0 = 8.\n\nSo (3,5) is the closest apple.\nI should move towards (3,5).\nFrom (1,1) to (3,5):\nI need to increase x and y.\nSo I should move RIGHT or UP.\nRIGHT: (2,1).\nUP: (1,2).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,1), next turn I can move RIGHT to (3,1) or UP to (2,2).\nIf I move UP to (1,2), next turn I can move RIGHT to (2,2) or UP to (1,3).\n\nBoth are valid. Which is better?\n(3,5) is at x=3, y=5.\nFrom (2,1):\nX is 2 (need 3). Y is 1 (need 5).\nFrom (1,2):\nX is 1 (need 3). Y is 2 (need 5).\n\nPath from (2,1) to (3,5): RIGHT, UP, UP, UP, UP. (1 Right, 4 Ups). Total 5 moves.\nPath from (1,2) to (3,5): RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, UP, UP, UP. (2 Rights, 4 Ups). Total 6 moves.\n\nSo moving RIGHT to (2,1) gets me to (3,5) in 5 moves (assuming clear path).\nMoving UP to (1,2) takes 6 moves.\nTherefore, RIGHT is more efficient to reach the nearest apple (3,5).\n\nAlso, (3,5) is an apple.\nIf I reach (3,5), I grow.\nAlso, there is an apple at (4,8) nearby.\nAnd (6,6).\nSo the direction to the center/right is better.\n\nLet's check safety of RIGHT to (2,1) again.\nEnemy at (3,3).\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (2,3), I am at (2,1). Distance 2.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (3,2), I am at (2,1). Distance 2.\nIf enemy moves UP to (3,4), distance 3.\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (4,3), distance 3.\nAll safe.\n\nLet's check safety of UP to (1,2).\nEnemy at (3,3).\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (2,3), I am at (1,2). Distance 2.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (3,2), I am at (1,2). Distance 2.\nAll safe.\n\nSince RIGHT is more efficient towards the closest apple (3,5) and moves me away from the left wall into a slightly more open area, I prefer RIGHT.\n\nWait, is there any apple at (2,2)? No.\nIs there any apple at (1,4)? No.\nSo I am just navigating to (3,5).\nFrom (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (3,5).\nBut wait, (3,3) is occupied by the enemy head. I cannot go there.\nSo I must navigate around the enemy.\nIf I am at (3,2), I cannot go UP to (3,3).\nI would need to go RIGHT to (4,2) or LEFT to (2,2).\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,2), then UP to (4,3), then UP to (4,4), then LEFT to (3,4), then UP to (3,5).\nThis adds steps.\nHowever, the enemy is moving. The enemy might move away from (3,3).\nIf the enemy moves UP to (3,4), then (3,3) becomes free.\nOr if the enemy moves RIGHT to (4,3), (3,3) becomes free.\nSo it's not a hard block.\n\nLet's assume the enemy stays at (3,3). I cannot land on (3,3).\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1).\nNext turn I can go RIGHT to (3,1) (safe).\nNext turn I can go UP to (3,2) (safe, enemy is at (3,3)).\nNext turn I can go UP to (3,3)? No, enemy is there.\nSo I must go RIGHT to (4,2) or LEFT to (2,2).\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,2), I am moving away from (3,5).\nIf I go LEFT to (2,2), I am moving away from (3,5).\nSo if the enemy stays at (3,3) (or moves to (3,4) and then (3,5)), it might block me.\nBut the enemy is also trying to survive.\nIf the enemy goes to (3,5), it eats the apple. Then I should target another apple.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nThere are 5 apples total.\n(9,1), (4,8), (6,6), (3,5), (9,9).\nI am at (1,1).\n(3,5) is the closest.\n(9,1) is also close in terms of Y (same Y), but far in X.\nDistance to (9,1) is 8 steps right.\nDistance to (3,5) is 6 steps (without obstacles).\nDistance to (4,8) is 10 steps.\nDistance to (6,6) is 10 steps.\nDistance to (9,9) is 16 steps.\n\nSo (3,5) is the primary target.\n(9,1) is secondary if (3,5) is contested.\n\nLet's re-verify the \"Backwards\" rule.\n\"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nI have no body. So I can't do this.\nHowever, if I have length 1, \"behind\" is undefined. So I am safe.\nIf I eat an apple, I will have a body.\nThen next turn, if I am at (2,1) coming from (1,1), the cell (1,1) is the \"tail\".\nIf I move LEFT back to (1,1), I hit my own tail (which might have moved? No, if I don't eat, the tail moves forward).\nIf I eat, I grow. The tail stays at (1,1). So moving LEFT to (1,1) would hit my body.\nBut right now, no body.\n\nSo for this turn, I just need to pick a safe direction that moves me towards an apple.\nRIGHT moves me towards (3,5) and (9,1).\nUP moves me towards (3,5) and (4,8) (indirectly).\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I am at (2,1).\nIf I move UP, I am at (1,2).\n\nConsider the enemy. The enemy is at (3,3).\nIf the enemy moves UP, it goes to (3,4). It is closer to (3,5).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN, (3,2).\nIf the enemy moves LEFT, (2,3).\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT, (4,3).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,1):\nEnemy LEFT to (2,3): distance 2.\nEnemy DOWN to (3,2): distance 2.\nIf I move UP to (1,2):\nEnemy LEFT to (2,3): distance 2.\nEnemy DOWN to (3,2): distance 2.\n\nSo similar safety.\nNow, let's look at the apple at (9,1).\nIf I go RIGHT, I am moving towards (9,1).\nIf I go UP, I am moving away from (9,1).\n(9,1) is an apple. If the enemy ignores it, I can get it.\nBut (3,5) is closer.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am moving towards the center and (3,5).\nIf I go UP, I am moving towards (3,5) but also towards (4,8).\n(4,8) is further than (3,5).\n(3,5) is 6 steps. (4,8) is 10 steps.\n\nLet's think about the board geometry.\nTop is walls.\nLeft is walls.\nRight is walls.\nBottom is walls.\n(3,5) is at x=3, y=5. It's in the center-left.\n(4,8) is at x=4, y=8. Top center.\n(6,6) is at x=6, y=6. Center-right.\n(9,9) is top right corner.\n(9,1) is bottom right corner.\n\nI am at bottom left (1,1).\nGoing RIGHT moves me towards the center and the right side.\nGoing UP moves me towards the top.\nThe top is dangerous (dead end).\nThe center is more flexible.\nSo I should prefer RIGHT.\n\nAlso, the enemy is at (3,3). If I go RIGHT, I can threaten to flank it or just pass by.\nIf I go UP, I might run into it if it goes LEFT.\nActually, if I go UP to (1,2), and enemy goes LEFT to (2,3), we are close.\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1), and enemy goes LEFT to (2,3), we are close.\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1), and enemy goes DOWN to (3,2), we are close.\n\nLet's check if the enemy can kill me next turn if I move RIGHT.\nEnemy needs to move to (2,1). Can it?\nFrom (3,3): UP(3,4), DOWN(3,2), LEFT(2,3), RIGHT(4,3).\nNo. Distance is 2.\nIf I am at (2,1), and enemy is at (3,3).\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (3,2), distance is |2-3| + |1-2| = 2.\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (2,3), distance is |2-2| + |1-3| = 2.\nSo I am safe from head-on collision next turn (unless I move into it, or it moves into me, but I can see where it goes).\n\nWait, if I am at (2,1) and enemy is at (3,2) (after it moves DOWN).\nI am at (2,1). It is at (3,2).\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,1), distance is 1.\nIf I move UP to (2,2), distance is 1.\nIf I move DOWN to (2,0), distance is 2.\nIf I move LEFT to (1,1), distance is 2.\nSo if it moves to (3,2), I am safe as long as I don't move into it.\nI can just move LEFT or DOWN or UP.\n\nSo, movement is manageable.\n\nIs there any reason to avoid RIGHT?\nMaybe the enemy moves LEFT to (2,3).\nIf I am at (2,1), enemy at (2,3).\nI can move UP to (2,2).\nIf I move UP to (2,2), and enemy moves DOWN to (2,2), we die.\nBut why would enemy move DOWN to (2,2)? It has no apples there.\nIt might move LEFT to (1,3) or RIGHT to (3,3) or UP to (2,4).\nSo likely I am safe.\n\nIf I move UP to (1,2), and enemy moves LEFT to (2,3).\nI am at (1,2), enemy at (2,3).\nI can move UP to (1,3).\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (2,2), we are safe (distance 1).\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (1,3), we die (head-on).\nWhy would enemy move LEFT? It's going towards the center or apples.\n(1,3) is empty.\nIt's possible but less likely than moving UP towards (3,5) or (4,8).\n\nSo both directions are roughly equally safe.\n\nHowever, RIGHT is more efficient towards the closest apple (3,5) AND the right-side apples.\nUP is efficient towards (3,5) but less efficient towards (4,8) and (6,6).\nAlso, if I go RIGHT, I can \"chase\" the apple at (9,1) if (3,5) is eaten by the enemy.\nIf I go UP, I am committing to the top/center area.\n\nI will choose RIGHT.\n\nOne final check. Is there an apple at (2,1) or (1,2)? No.\nIs there an obstacle?\nBoard state shows:\nRow 1: \" . 1 . . . . . . . A \"\nRow 0: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nSo (2,1) is empty. (0,1) is empty.\n(3,1) is empty.\n\nSo RIGHT is safe and productive.\n\nOne more consideration: \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n\"Decreasing your y coordinate is down\".\nCurrent y=1. If I go DOWN, y=0 (bottom wall).\nSo DOWN is not good. It blocks me.\nUP is y=2.\nRIGHT is x=2.\nLEFT is x=0.\n\nSo I will go RIGHT.\n\nWait, let's double check the board for any \"hidden\" info.\nApples at: (9, 1), (4, 8), (6, 6), (3, 5), (9, 9).\nMy head: (1,1).\nEnemy: (3,3).\n\nIs there any way the enemy can predict my move?\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1), the enemy might go LEFT to (2,3) to cut me off.\nBut I can handle that.\n\nIf I go UP to (1,2), the enemy might go LEFT to (2,3).\nThen I am at (1,2), it is at (2,3).\nI can go UP to (1,3).\nIt can go DOWN to (2,2).\nDistance 1.\nI can go LEFT to (0,3). (If I am at 1,3).\nIt's fine.\n\nActually, if I go UP to (1,2), I am closer to the enemy if it goes LEFT.\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1), I am closer to the enemy if it goes DOWN.\nIf it goes DOWN to (3,2), I am at (2,1). Distance 2.\nIf it goes LEFT to (2,3), I am at (2,1). Distance 2.\nSo I am 2 steps away.\nIf I go UP to (1,2), and it goes LEFT to (2,3), distance 2.\nIf it goes DOWN to (3,2), distance 2.\nSo equivalent.\n\nBut RIGHT is better for the apple path.\n\nWhat about (9,1)?\nIf I go RIGHT, I can go RIGHT, RIGHT... all the way to (9,1).\nBut (3,5) is closer.\nIf I go UP, I am moving away from (9,1).\nSo I should definitely go RIGHT.\n\nI will choose RIGHT.\n\nWait, I should consider the \"Backwards\" rule again. Since I have no body, it's not an issue.\nIf I was length 2, say (1,1) -> (0,1), then moving LEFT (back to (0,1)) is bad.\nBut I am length 1.\n\nSo I am safe.\n\nFinal check on coordinates.\n(0,0) bottom left.\n(9,9) top right.\nY increases upwards.\nI am at (1,1).\nRIGHT is (2,1).\nUP is (1,2).\nDOWN is (1,0).\nLEFT is (0,1).\n\nIs (0,1) safe? Yes. But it leads to (0,0) corner. Bad idea.\nIs (1,0) safe? Yes. But it leads to bottom wall. Bad idea.\nSo only UP and RIGHT are viable.\n\nI'll go RIGHT.\n\nOne detail: The enemy is at (3,3). If I go RIGHT to (2,1), and the enemy goes LEFT to (2,3), we are both at x=2.\nBut y=1 and y=3.\nIf I go UP to (2,2) next turn, and enemy goes DOWN to (2,2), we collide.\nBut the enemy is likely chasing (3,5) or (4,8). Moving DOWN to (2,2) is moving away from those apples.\nSo unlikely.\nBut even if it does, I can just not go UP. I can go RIGHT to (3,1) or DOWN to (2,0).\nSo I have options.\nIf I am at (1,2) and enemy at (2,3), I can go UP to (1,3). If enemy goes DOWN to (2,2), we are safe (diagonal).\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (1,3), we collide.\nWhy would enemy go LEFT? It's going to (3,5) or (4,8). (1,3) is away from them.\nSo again, unlikely.\n\nSo both are safe. RIGHT is better for apples.\n\nLet's write the plan.\n\"Target the closest apple at (3,5). Move RIGHT to get closer and avoid the wall. Keep an eye on the enemy at (3,3), avoid head-on collisions. If the enemy moves to block (3,5), pivot to (4,8) or (9,1).\"\n\nThis plan fits the \"Rationale\" requirement.\n\nOne last check: Is there any apple at (2,1)? No.\nIs there any apple at (1,2)? No.\nSo I am just positioning.\n\nWait, look at the board again.\nRow 9: A at (9,9).\nRow 8: A at (4,8).\nRow 6: A at (6,6).\nRow 5: A at (3,5).\nRow 1: A at (9,1).\nMy head at (1,1).\nEnemy at (3,3).\n\nIs there any apple closer than (3,5)?\n(9,1) is 8 steps away.\n(3,5) is 6 steps away.\n(4,8) is 10 steps away.\n(6,6) is 10 steps away.\n(9,9) is 16 steps away.\nSo (3,5) is indeed the closest.\n\nOkay, I'm confident in RIGHT.\n\nDouble check: Is (2,1) occupied?\nBoard state:\nRow 1: \" . 1 . . . . . . . A \"\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 ...\nSo index 2 is empty.\nRow 0: \" . . . . . . . . . . \"\nSo (2,1) is empty.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT.\n\nPlan: Target apple at (3,5) by moving RIGHT. Maintain distance from enemy.\n\nOne more thing: \"All snakes move simultaneously\".\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,1) and enemy moves LEFT to (2,3).\nMy head is (2,1).\nEnemy head is (2,3).\nMy body is (1,1) (if I don't eat, it disappears? No, length 1. If I don't eat, I just leave (1,1). If I don't eat, I stay length 1. So my body is just (2,1)).\nWait, if I am length 1 and I move to (2,1), my \"body\" is just (2,1).\nIf enemy moves to (2,3), it's safe.\nIf enemy moves to (2,2), it's safe.\nIf enemy moves to (2,1), we die (head-on).\nCan enemy move to (2,1)?\nFrom (3,3) to (2,1):\nLEFT to (2,3). DOWN to (3,2).\nTo get to (2,1), it would need to go LEFT then DOWN (2 turns) or DOWN then LEFT (2 turns).\nSo it cannot reach (2,1) in 1 turn.\nSo I am safe from head-on collision.\n\nWhat about me moving into enemy body?\nEnemy body is none.\nSo I can't hit it.\n\nWhat about enemy moving into my body?\nMy body is (2,1) (after move).\nEnemy moves to (2,1)? Impossible as above.\nSo safe.\n\nConclusion: RIGHT is safe and optimal.\n\nI will format the output as requested.\nRationale block (optional).\nThen \"RIGHT\".\n\nThe prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo I should write the plan.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT towards the cluster of apples at (3,5), (4,8), and (6,6). Avoid the enemy at (3,3). If the enemy blocks (3,5), pivot to (4,8) or (9,1).\n\nActually, I can just say \"Move RIGHT to approach (3,5)\".\n\nLet's keep it concise.\n\"Target (3,5). Move RIGHT to get closer. Avoid enemy collision.\"\n\nThis is sufficient.\n\nWait, I should check if I can be trapped.\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1).\nNext turn, enemy goes LEFT to (2,3).\nI go UP to (2,2).\nNext turn, enemy goes DOWN to (2,2). -> Collision. But unlikely.\nIf enemy goes UP to (2,4).\nI can go UP to (2,3). (If enemy moved away).\nOr I can go RIGHT to (3,2).\nI have options.\n\nIf I go UP to (1,2).\nNext turn, enemy goes LEFT to (2,3).\nI go UP to (1,3).\nNext turn, enemy goes DOWN to (2,2).\nI am at (1,3). Enemy at (2,2).\nI can go UP to (1,4). Or LEFT to (0,3). Or RIGHT to (2,3).\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,3), I might collide if enemy is there.\nIf enemy moves UP to (2,3), I die.\nWhy would enemy move UP? To chase (3,5) or (4,8).\nSo it's possible.\nSo if I am at (1,3) and enemy at (2,2), I should NOT go RIGHT.\nI should go UP or LEFT.\n\nSo both paths are manageable.\n\nRIGHT seems slightly better because it moves me towards the \"center\" of the map, where apples are.\nUP moves me towards the top, where (4,8) and (9,9) are, but also towards the wall.\n(3,5) is not top. It's y=5. (Top is y=9).\n(4,8) is y=8.\n(9,9) is y=9.\nSo moving UP might be \"correct\" for (4,8) and (9,9).\nBut (3,5) is closer.\nAnd (3,5) leads to (4,8).\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1), then UP, UP... to (2,5).\nThen RIGHT to (3,5).\nThen UP to (3,6), etc.\nIf I go UP to (1,2), then UP to (1,3)...\nI need to get to x=3.\nSo I need to go RIGHT eventually.\nIf I go RIGHT now, I save a step.\n\nSo I will definitely go RIGHT.\n\nPlan: Target (3,5) by moving RIGHT. Avoid the enemy at (3,3).\n\nOne final check on the board state provided:\n\"9 . . . . . . . . . A\"\n\"8 . . . . A . . . . .\"\n\"7 . . . . . . . . . .\"\n\"6 . . . . . . A . . .\"\n\"5 . . .

Enemy.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT.\n\nI will write the rationale and then the move.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nI will put the rationale in the thinking block, and the final word in the output block.\nActually, the prompt says \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning. You may also write a short long-term plan... This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nSo I should write the plan in the response, before the move.\nBut the instructions say \"Think step by step\" and then \"Write the final answer\".\nI will write the plan in the response text, then the move on the last line.\n\nSomething like:\n\"Plan: Move RIGHT towards (3,5). Maintain distance from enemy.\nAnalysis: ...\"\n\nBut the prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan... Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nIt doesn't strictly require me to write a rationale in the output text, but it's good practice to show the reasoning.\nHowever, the user sees the \"Board state\" and my \"Rationale\" from the previous turn.\nSo I should probably just output the move if I am confident.\nBut the prompt encourages explaining reasoning.\nI will include a brief rationale/plan.\n\nLet's write:\nTargeting the closest apple at (3,5). Moving RIGHT to approach it while avoiding the left wall. This position also offers flexibility to pivot to (4,8) or (9,1) if needed. The enemy is 2 steps away, so collision is not an immediate threat.\n\nThen the move.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"You may think out loud... You may also write a short long-term plan... Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nI'll just write a short plan.\n\n\"Plan: Move RIGHT to approach (3,5).\"\n\nThen \"RIGHT\".\n\nWait, the \"Turn: 0 / 150\".\nThis is the very first move.\nSo I don't have a \"last rationale\" to refer to.\nI should just state my plan.\n\nOkay, I will output the plan and then the move.\n\nOne check: \"My last move information: None\".\nSo I am starting fresh.\n\nFinal check on danger.\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,1), I am safe.\nIf I move UP to (1,2), I am safe.\nRIGHT is better for apples.\nRIGHT it is.\n\nOne edge case: What if the enemy moves UP to (3,4) and then next turn LEFT to (2,4) to block me?\nI will cross that bridge when I get there.\nFor now, optimize for the next few turns.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,3). It is likely to move UP to (3,4) to get closer to (3,5).\nIf it does, I can still reach (3,5) if I move RIGHT -> RIGHT -> UP -> UP -> UP.\nWait, if enemy is at (3,4), I can't go to (3,4).\nI need to go to (3,5).\nFrom (3,3), if enemy goes UP to (3,4), it is between me and (3,5).\nIf I am at (3,2), I can't go to (3,3) or (3,4).\nI can go to (4,2) -> (4,3) -> (3,3) (if empty) -> (3,4) (if empty) -> (3,5).\nWait, if enemy is at (3,4), I can't go to (3,3) if enemy body is there (but enemy is length 1).\nIf enemy is at (3,4), and I am at (3,2).\nNext turn, enemy might go UP to (3,5) and eat the apple.\nOr go LEFT to (2,4).\nIf enemy eats (3,5), I target another apple.\nSo it's a race.\nMoving RIGHT now gets me closer to (3,5) in case the enemy is slow or targets another apple (like (4,8)).\nIf the enemy targets (4,8), it will likely go UP to (3,4) then UP to (3,5) (blocking) or LEFT to (2,4) then UP.\nActually, if the enemy is smart, it will go UP to (3,4).\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,1), I am 4 steps away (Manhattan: 2,1 -> 2,2 -> 2,3 -> 2,4 -> 3,4 -> 3,5). No, that's 5 steps.\nWait, 2,1 to 3,5 is |2-3| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5.\nEnemy 3,3 to 3,5 is 2 steps.\nSo the enemy is much closer to (3,5).\nWait, this changes things.\nIf the enemy is 2 steps away and I am 5-6 steps away, I might not get (3,5) if the enemy wants it.\nBut the enemy might not want it? It's a free point. Everyone wants points.\nSo the enemy will likely go for (3,5).\nIf the enemy goes for (3,5), it will get there in 2 turns (3->4->5).\nI will be at (2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> ... I can't get there in 2 turns.\nSo I should probably ignore (3,5) and go for something else?\nNo, if the enemy eats it, it's gone.\nIf I race for it, I might die or get there too late.\nBut if I don't race, I get nothing.\nHowever, if the enemy is distracted or moves towards (4,8), I can get (3,5).\nOr maybe the enemy is not going for (3,5).\nIt's turn 0. The enemy might be moving randomly or towards a different apple.\n(4,8) is also an apple.\n(9,9) is an apple.\n(9,1) is an apple.\nThe enemy might be going for (4,8) or (9,9).\nIf the enemy goes for (9,9), it will move UP and RIGHT.\nIf it goes for (4,8), it will move UP.\nSo it will likely move UP.\nIf it moves UP, it blocks (3,5).\nSo maybe I should go for (9,1)?\n(9,1) is 8 steps away.\n(3,5) is 6 steps away (without obstacle).\nWith obstacle (enemy at 3,4), it's impossible or delayed.\nLet's assume the worst: Enemy moves UP to (3,4).\nNext turn, if I am at (2,1), I can go RIGHT to (3,1).\nEnemy at (3,4).\nDistance 3.\nI can go UP to (3,2).\nEnemy can go UP to (3,5) (eat apple) or LEFT to (2,4).\nIf enemy eats (3,5), it's gone.\nSo I should pivot to (4,8).\n(4,8) is closer to (3,4) than (3,5) is to (3,3)? No.\n(3,3) to (4,8) is |3-4| + |3-8| = 1 + 5 = 6.\n(3,3) to (3,5) is 2.\nSo enemy will eat (3,5).\nSo I should go for (4,8) or (9,1).\n(4,8) is at (4,8).\nFrom (1,1), Manhattan is 3 + 7 = 10.\nFrom (1,1) to (9,1) is 8.\nSo (9,1) is closer than (4,8).\n(6,6) is 5+5=10.\n(3,5) is 2+4=6 (but contested).\n(9,9) is 8+8=16.\n\nSo (3,5) is the closest BUT contested.\n(9,1) is the next closest (8 steps).\n(4,8) and (6,6) are 10 steps.\n\nIf I assume the enemy takes (3,5), I should go for (9,1).\nTo go to (9,1), I should move RIGHT to (2,1) (towards x=9).\nIf I move UP to (1,2), I am moving away from (9,1).\nSo RIGHT is still the better move for the pivot to (9,1).\nAlso, if the enemy decides NOT to take (3,5), RIGHT is good for (3,5).\nSo RIGHT covers both options (race for 3,5 or pivot to 9,1).\n\nIf I move UP to (1,2), I am committing to the top (4,8, 9,9).\n(4,8) is 10 steps away.\n(3,5) is contested.\n(9,1) is far if I go UP first.\n\nSo RIGHT is the most flexible move.\nIt keeps me in the game for (3,5) AND (9,1).\nUP keeps me in the game for (3,5) (less efficient) and (4,8).\nRIGHT -> (2,1) -> (3,1) -> ... -> (9,1).\nRIGHT -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> ... -> (3,5) (if available).\n\nSo I stick with RIGHT.\n\nOne final check: Is (3,1) safe?\nYes.\nIs (4,1) safe?\nYes.\nIs (5,1)...\nYes.\nSo the path to (9,1) is clear of walls.\nEnemy is at (3,3). It won't block (9,1).\nSo (9,1) is a safe long-term plan if (3,5) fails.\n\nSo I am good.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT. If enemy takes (3,5), pivot to (9,1). Otherwise, continue to (3,5).\n\nI will just write \"Target (3,5) or (9,1) by moving RIGHT.\"\n\nWait, the user wants the final line to be exactly one word.\nI will put the plan in the thinking block or as a prefix.\n\"The prompt says: You may think out loud... You may also write a short long-term plan... Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nSo I should put the plan in the response text.\n\n\"Plan: Move RIGHT towards (3,5) or (9,1).\"\n\"RIGHT\"\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nDouble check the board for (2,1).\nRow 1: \" . 1 . . . . . . . A\"\nYes, empty.\n\nOkay, I'm ready.\n\nOne detail: The enemy is \"Snake #0\".\nMy ID is 1.\nThe board shows \"0\" at (3,3) and \"1\" at (1,1).\nCorrect.\n\nI will generate the response now.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to approach the nearest apple. This direction is optimal whether I pursue (3,5) or pivot to (9,1) if the enemy takes (3,5). It keeps options open.\nRIGHTPlan: Move RIGHT to approach the closest apple at (3,5). This also positions me to pivot towards (9,1) if the enemy contests (3,5). Maintaining distance from the enemy at (3,3) is a priority.",

          "rationale": "Analysis of current situation:\n- **Position:** Head at (3,1), body empty. Enemy #0 is at (3,5) with a body segment at (3,4).\n- **Immediate Threat:** The enemy snake is directly vertically aligned with me. Their head is at (3,5). I am at (3,1).\n- **Move Analysis:**\n    - **UP:** Moving to (3,2) is safe. However, it aligns me directly with the enemy head. If I move UP and the enemy moves DOWN, we collide (I die). If I move UP and the enemy stays or moves elsewhere, I survive. It's a gamble, but it positions me closer to the apple at (4,8).\n    - **DOWN:** Moving to (3,0) is safe (board boundary). This moves me away from the immediate threat of the enemy head and allows me to pivot towards the apples at (9,1) or (2,9).\n    - **LEFT:** Moving to (2,1) is safe. This moves me away from the direct vertical line of the enemy.\n    - **RIGHT:** Moving to (4,1) is safe. This moves me away from the direct vertical line of the enemy.\n\n- **Risk Assessment:** Moving UP carries a significant risk of immediate death if the enemy moves DOWN. Since the enemy has already collected 1 apple and I have 0, I cannot afford to lose a turn or die early. The \"Plan\" from the previous turn suggested moving RIGHT to approach (3,5), but that plan seems to ignore the risk of the enemy moving down into me.\n- **Strategy:** Prioritize survival. Avoid the direct line of the enemy head if possible, or at least minimize the risk.\n    - If I move UP, I bet the enemy won't move DOWN.\n    - If I move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT, I am safe regardless of the enemy's move (unless they chase me specifically, which is unlikely in one turn).\n\n- **Apple Proximity:**\n    - (9,1) is reachable via RIGHT moves.\n    - (2,9) is reachable via UP/LEFT moves.\n    - (4,8) is reachable via UP/RIGHT moves.\n\nGiven the turn count (2/150) and score (0-1), preserving life is paramount. Moving directly towards the enemy (UP) is the highest risk move of the four. Moving DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT guarantees survival against an enemy moving DOWN or STAYING. Since I don't know the enemy's move, I should choose a safe vector.\n\nComparing DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT:\n- **DOWN (3,0):** Takes me to the edge. Limits mobility slightly but safe.\n- **LEFT (2,1):** Opens up path to (2,9) apple. Safe.\n- **RIGHT (4,1):** Opens up path to (9,1) apple. Safe.\n\nAll three are equally safe against the specific threat of the enemy at (3,5) moving DOWN. However, the previous turn's rationale mentioned \"pivot to (9,1) if the enemy takes (3,5)\". Moving RIGHT facilitates that pivot better than LEFT or DOWN. It keeps me closer to the cluster of apples on the right side of the board while distancing me from the enemy.\n\nWait, let me re-read the \"Last Move Rationale\": \"Move RIGHT to approach the nearest apple at (3,5)\". (3,5) is the enemy's head. The previous AI was moving to eat the apple the enemy is standing on? Or perhaps it misidentified (3,5) as an apple? Regardless, the enemy is there. Moving RIGHT puts space between us.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4,1), I am safe.\nIf I move DOWN to (3,0), I am safe.\nIf I move LEFT to (2,1), I am safe.\nIf I move UP to (3,2), I am gambling.\n\nThe \"nearest apple\" strategy mentioned in the previous turn's rationale is flawed if it leads into the enemy. The apple at (4,8) is blocked by the enemy (vertical alignment).\nThe apples at (9,1) and (2,9) are open.\n(9,1) is to the RIGHT and UP.\n(2,9) is to the LEFT and UP.\n\nMoving RIGHT moves towards (9,1) and away from the enemy.\nMoving LEFT moves towards (2,9) and away from the enemy.\nMoving DOWN moves away from all apples but is safe.\n\nThe previous move was RIGHT. Continuing RIGHT keeps momentum towards the apple at (9,1). Let's check if (4,1) is safe. The enemy is at (3,5). The enemy is far away. The board is clear.\n\nI will choose **RIGHT**. This avoids the immediate danger of the vertical column (UP) and moves towards the target apple at (9,1) as previously intended.\n\nPlan: Avoid the vertical line of the enemy at (3,5). Move towards the apple at (9,1).\n\nOne detail: The previous move was RIGHT. If I move RIGHT again, I go to (4,1). This is valid. If I move UP, I go to (3,2). If I move UP and the enemy moves DOWN, I die (collision). If I move RIGHT and the enemy moves DOWN, I live. Therefore, RIGHT is safer than UP. DOWN is also safer than UP. LEFT is also safer than UP.\nAmong RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT, which is best?\nRIGHT: Moves towards (9,1).\nLEFT: Moves towards (2,9).\nDOWN: Moves away from apples.\nRIGHT seems optimal for score potential.\n\nFinal check of boundaries and obstacles.\n(4,1): Is it occupied?\nEnemy #0: Head (3,5), Body (3,4). No.\nApples: (9,1)... (4,1) is empty.\nMy body: Empty.\n\nResult: RIGHT is a safe move that progresses towards a goal.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to avoid the vertical confrontation with the enemy at (3,5) and continue towards the apple at (9,1).\n\nRIGHT",

Moves towards the apple at (2, 9) and away from the immediate right side.\n    - **RIGHT:** (5, 1). Moves towards the apple at (9, 1).

Moving RIGHT continues this trajectory. Moving UP moves towards the central apples but the path is more complex (involving navigating around the enemy if I go for (4, 8)).

Body: [(9, 2)].\n    *   I am pinned against the right wall (x=9).\n*   **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at **(4, 8)**. Body: [(5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7)].\n    *   This snake is in the center-left, moving towards the top apples.\n*   **Apples:**\n    *   **Top-Right Cluster:** (9, 9), (8, 9) - These are directly accessible by moving UP along the right wall.\n    *   **Left Cluster:** (2, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8) - These are closer to Snake #0.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1.  **UP (to 9, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. (9, 4) is empty on the board.\n    *   **Strategy:** I am currently aligned vertically with the apples at (9, 9) and (8, 9). Continuing to move UP is the most efficient path to secure the top-right cluster before Snake #0 can navigate around to claim them. The path (9,3) -> (9,4) -> (9,5) -> (9,6) -> (9,7) -> (9,8) -> (9,9) is clear and safe.\n2.  **LEFT (to 8, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. (8, 3) is empty on the board.\n    *   **Strategy:** While this offers more maneuverability, it moves me away from the nearest apple cluster (Top-Right) and towards the center where Snake #0 is active. It is better to secure the apples on the right side first.\n3.  **DOWN (to 9, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** **DEADLY.** (9, 2) is occupied by my own body.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Impossible (x=9 is boundary).\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move **UP** to (9, 4).
