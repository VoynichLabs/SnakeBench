Moving RIGHT to (8,4) will allow me to eat it and gain a point. This is the most immediate opportunity to catch up to the enemy snake (1 vs 3 apples).\n\n## Enemy Snake Movement Prediction\n\nThe enemy snake is at the top-left area of the board and has several safe moves available. They cannot reach me at (8,4) in one move regardless of their choice.\n\n## Decision Analysis\n\nIf I move:\n- RIGHT to (8,4): I will eat the apple and gain 1 point, moving me to 2 apples total. This is the best immediate opportunity to catch up.\n- UP to (7,5): This moves me away from the apple and gives the enemy more time to potentially get other apples.\n- DOWN to (7,3): This also moves me away from the apple and could potentially trap me in the bottom of the board.\n\nGiven the urgency of catching up to the enemy snake and the immediate availability of an apple right next to me, moving RIGHT to eat the apple is clearly the best choice.\n\n## Long-term Strategy Note\n\nAfter eating this apple, I'll be at 2 apples vs their 3. I need to continue pursuing the remaining apples aggressively while maintaining safety. The apple at (8,8) or (6,8) will likely be my next target after this one.\n\nRIGHT",

They cannot move UP (off board) or DOWN (into their own body), so they can only move LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n## Decision Analysis\n\nIf I move:\n- UP to (8,5): I start moving toward the (8,8) apple and maintain flexibility to go UP again or LEFT/RIGHT. This keeps me in the right side of the board where there are multiple apples.\n- DOWN to (8,3): This moves me toward the (9,2) apple but risks getting trapped in the bottom-right corner.\n- RIGHT to (9,4): This moves me to the edge of the board and toward (9,2) apple, but reduces my available movement options on future turns.\n\nGiven that:\n1. The enemy snake is severely constrained and can only move LEFT or RIGHT at (4,9)\n2. Moving UP gives me the best path to the (8,8) apple which is directly above me\n3. Moving UP keeps my options open for future moves\n4. The (8,8) apple is closer and more accessible than other options\n\nI should move UP toward the (8,8) apple.\n\n## Long-term Strategy Note\n\nAfter moving UP, I'll continue pursuing the apples at (8,8) and (6,8) in the top-right quadrant. The enemy snake is cornered at the top-left and has limited mobility, so I have a good opportunity to pull ahead. I need to be careful not to get trapped in the right side of the board myself while pursuing these apples.\n\nUP",

From (9,7), I can move DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5) next turn.\n\nMoving DOWN to (9,7) gives me better positioning for the nearest apples while maintaining safety.\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\nAfter this move, I'll position myself to pursue (9,5) efficiently, then (9,2). From there, I'll need to work on (0,5) and (5,0). The path should be: (9,5) -> (9,4) -> (9,3) -> (9,2) -> (8,2) -> (7,2) -> ... -> (5,0) -> (4,0) -> ... -> (0,5). Keep monitoring the enemy's movements and avoid getting trapped on the right edge. I'm currently at 3 apples vs enemy's 5, so I need to be efficient to catch up.\n\nDOWN",

I need to consider which move:\n1. Keeps me safe from the enemy snake\n2. Moves me toward reachable apples\n3. Maintains future flexibility\n\nThe enemy snake is at (9, 8) in the top-right corner. Moving RIGHT toward (8, 7) would move me closer to the apples at (8, 3) and (9, 2), but also closer to the enemy snake. However, the enemy snake is currently trapped in the corner and has limited movement options.\n\n**Best move selection:**\nRIGHT to (8, 7) is strategically sound. It:\n- Moves me toward the cluster of apples at (8, 3) and (9, 2)\n- Maintains distance from the trapped enemy snake\n- Keeps all three safe directions open for next turn\n- Positions me well for collecting multiple apples in the coming turns\n\n**Short-term plan:**\nAfter moving to (8, 7), I'll have clear paths to collect (8, 3) and then (9, 2) or (9, 5), extending my apple lead significantly while the enemy snake remains constrained in the corner.\n\nRIGHT",
