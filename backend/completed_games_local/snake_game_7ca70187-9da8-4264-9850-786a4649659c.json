My head is at (3, 8) and Snake #1's head is at (3, 9).\n\n**Analysis of Moves:**\n- **UP**: Moving to (3, 9) would result in an immediate head-on collision with Snake #1 if they stay or move, or I would be moving into where their head currently is. Since snake heads move simultaneously, if Snake #1 moves to (2, 9), (4, 9), or stays/moves down, this is extremely dangerous. Specifically, if Snake #1 moves DOWN to (3, 8) and I move UP to (3, 9), we swap places, but if Snake #1 moves anywhere else or we both try to occupy (3, 9), I could die.\n- **DOWN**: Moving to (3, 7) is safe. It moves me away from the immediate threat of Snake #1 and toward the center of the board.\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (2, 8) is safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (4, 8) is safe.\n\n**Strategy:**\nSnake #1 is directly above me at (3, 9). The nearest apple for both of us is (6, 8) or (2, 9). However, Snake #1 is already adjacent to the apple at (2, 9). \nIf I move RIGHT toward (6, 8), I maintain distance from Snake #1. If I move DOWN, I create space and can then navigate toward (7, 6) or (6, 2).\n\nGiven that Snake #1 is only 1 tile away, moving UP is a guaranteed collision risk. Moving RIGHT puts me on a path toward apple (6, 8).\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nI will move RIGHT to begin approaching the apple at (6, 8) while maintaining a safe horizontal distance from Snake #1's current vertical line. This allows me to see how Snake #1 reacts before committing to a tighter area.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Wait \u2014 if enemy stays at (3, 8) and I move into (3, 8), then my head moves into a cell containing enemy\u2019s head only if enemy didn\u2019t move. But both move simultaneously. If enemy moves out of (3, 8), then (3, 8) is empty when I arrive, so safe. If enemy stays, then two heads in same cell = both die. So moving DOWN risks death if enemy stays.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 9) \u2192 has an apple.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Eliminate suicidal moves\nInvalid: UP (off board).  \nDOWN: risky if enemy stays at (3, 8) \u2014 but enemy might move away, and staying risks head-on if enemy moves UP to (3, 9).  \nActually, if enemy moves UP to (3, 9) and I stay at (3, 9), we collide. So staying is also dangerous.  \n\nSo my safe options: LEFT to (2, 9) or RIGHT to (4, 9) avoid enemy\u2019s possible head positions after move.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider future options and apples\nLEFT (2, 9): eats apple immediately, grows to length 2, body at (3, 9).  \nRIGHT (4, 9): no apple, remains length 1.  \n\nLEFT is better for score and doesn\u2019t risk collision.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Long-term plan\nAfter eating apple at (2, 9), my body will be at (3, 9), head at (2, 9).  \nNext turn, avoid moving back into (3, 9) (body).  \nFrom (2, 9), possible moves: UP off board, DOWN (2, 8), LEFT (1, 9), RIGHT (3, 9) (body).  \nSo only DOWN or LEFT viable next turn \u2014 a bit constrained, but okay.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (2, 9), move DOWN to (2, 8) to open more space unless enemy blocks.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

However, Snake #1 is at (2, 9). If Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (3, 9) (occupied by body) or stays, it's fine, but if they move RIGHT while their body clears, they get closer.

I must keep an eye on Snake #1 to avoid a head-on collision at (6, 8). If Snake #1 moves toward (6, 8) aggressively, I can pivot DOWN towards (7, 6) instead.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy\u2019s possible moves from (5, 8):**  \nEnemy can go UP (5, 9), DOWN (5, 7), LEFT (4, 8), RIGHT (6, 8).  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk unless I go RIGHT to (3, 8) and enemy goes LEFT to (4, 8) \u2014 not same cell.  \nBut enemy could move LEFT to (4, 8), which is adjacent to (3, 8) if I go RIGHT \u2014 not a collision, but could set up future head-on risk if we both move toward each other again.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Future options after each move:**  \n\n**DOWN to (2, 7):**  \nNext turn body at (2, 8), (2, 9).  \nPossible moves from (2, 7): UP (2, 8) my body, DOWN (2, 6) open, LEFT (1, 7) open, RIGHT (3, 7) open \u2192 3 safe moves.  \nPuts me closer to apple at (6, 2) but far.  \n\n**LEFT to (1, 8):**  \nNext turn body at (2, 8), (2, 9).  \nFrom (1, 8): UP (1, 9) open, DOWN (1, 7) open, LEFT (0, 8) open, RIGHT (2, 8) my body \u2192 3 safe moves.  \nPuts me near left edge, not near apples except (0, 0) far down.  \n\n**RIGHT to (3, 8):**  \nNext turn body at (2, 8), (2, 9).  \nFrom (3, 8): UP (3, 9) open, DOWN (3, 7) open, LEFT (2, 8) my body, RIGHT (4, 8) possible enemy location now? Enemy could be there if he moved LEFT this turn \u2014 but not certain.  \nRisk: If enemy went LEFT to (4, 8) this turn, then next turn he could move LEFT to (3, 8) while I\u2019m at (3, 8) \u2014 that\u2019s not head-on (simultaneous) because I\u2019d already be there, so he\u2019d die into my body. But wait \u2014 no, if he moves into my body, he dies, but I\u2019d already be at (3, 8) from previous turn, so that\u2019s fine for me. Actually, if I move RIGHT to (3, 8) now, enemy could also move RIGHT to (6, 8) (apple there) or DOWN/UP.  \n\nBut RIGHT puts me closer to apple at (6, 8) and (7, 6) and central area.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Apple proximity:**  \n- (6, 8) is 3 steps right, 0 up/down from (3, 8) if I go RIGHT now.  \n- (7, 6) is further but reachable.  \n- Going DOWN or LEFT doesn\u2019t get me closer to nearest apples except maybe (6, 2) if I go DOWN eventually.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 8), next turn I can go UP to (3, 9) or DOWN to (3, 7) to approach apple (6, 8) while keeping distance from enemy head (likely near (4, 8) or (5, 7) etc.). Avoid moving to (4, 8) if enemy might be there.  \n\nRIGHT seems best for apple hunting while keeping options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** RIGHT  \n\nRIGHT",

Since we are currently tied (3-3), I need to contest these apples.\n- Snake #1 is likely to move DOWN to (6, 2) or RIGHT to (7, 3).\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (8, 3).

Wait:  \nHeads moving into same cell on same turn = both die. But here:  \nEnemy LEFT \u2192 (7, 2)  \nMe RIGHT \u2192 (8, 2)  \nWe end up in different cells, so no collision.  \n\nBut if enemy goes LEFT to (7, 2) and I stay in (7, 2) (by moving LEFT, which is invalid for me anyway), that\u2019s not possible.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (9, 2) and I go RIGHT to (8, 2), no collision.  \n\nActually, **RIGHT is risky only if enemy goes LEFT into my destination (8, 2) at same time** \u2014 but enemy can\u2019t go LEFT into (7, 2) because I\u2019m there now, so enemy\u2019s LEFT is invalid. So enemy cannot move into (8, 2) from (8, 2)? Wait, enemy at (8, 2) moving LEFT goes to (7, 2) \u2014 that\u2019s my current head position, but I will move away. So if I go RIGHT to (8, 2) and enemy goes LEFT to (7, 2), we swap safely.  \n\nSo RIGHT is safe from head-on collision.  \n\n**Other risks:**  \nUP (7, 3): free, but near enemy body at (8, 3).  \nDOWN (7, 1): free, safe.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n- (6, 6) is 4 steps away (up/right).  \n- (0, 7) far.  \n- (9, 9) far.  \n- (0, 0) and (2, 0) far.  \n\n**Future options after each move:**  \n- **UP to (7, 3):**  \n  Body: [(7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4)]  \n  Next from (7, 3): UP (7, 4) free, DOWN (7, 2) body invalid, LEFT (6, 3) body invalid, RIGHT (8, 3) enemy body \u2192 only UP safe. That\u2019s risky (1 safe move).  \n\n- **DOWN to (7, 1):**  \n  Body: [(7, 1), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4)]  \n  Next from (7, 1): UP (7, 2) body invalid, DOWN (7, 0) free, LEFT (6, 1) free, RIGHT (8, 1) free \u2192 3 safe moves. Good.  \n\n- **RIGHT to (8, 2):**  \n  Body: [(8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4)]  \n  Next from (8, 2): UP (8, 3) enemy body invalid, DOWN (8, 1) free, LEFT (7, 2) body invalid, RIGHT (9, 2) free \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\n**Best move for safety and future options:**  \nUP leads to trap (only 1 safe move next).  \nRIGHT reduces options to 2 safe moves and puts me adjacent to enemy head.  \nDOWN gives 3 safe moves next and keeps distance from enemy.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI have 5 apples vs enemy\u2019s 3. No need to take risks. Avoid moving near enemy or into corners.  \nDOWN now, then consider moving toward (6, 6) apple via left/up later, but keep space.  \n\nDOWN",

Wait, Snake #1's neck is at (6, 1), and their head is (5, 1). They can move to (5, 0), (4, 1), or (5, 2). (6, 1) is their body, so they can't move RIGHT.\n- If I move LEFT to (6, 0), I am safe from their current body and head.\n\n**Plan:**\nThe only viable move is LEFT. This continues my path along the bottom wall toward the apple at (2, 0). Snake #1 is currently blocking much of the middle-right area, but my path along the bottom is clear. I need to be careful not to let Snake #1 \"pin\" me against the bottom wall. However, since they are at Y=1 and I am at Y=0, moving LEFT to (6, 0) is the only way to progress toward the nearest food.\n\nLEFT",
