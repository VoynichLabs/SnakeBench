They are far away from the (0, 8) apple. They are likely to chase apples on the right side like (7, 6) or (8, 4).\nMoving UP puts me on the path to (0, 8) and moves my head away from the enemy's horizontal line (Y=6), reducing the risk of a head-on collision if the enemy moves LEFT. It also keeps the option to go LEFT or DOWN in subsequent turns.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Move UP towards apple at (0, 8).\n2.  Avoid the enemy at (6, 6). Since I am moving UP, I am moving away from the enemy's Y coordinate, making collisions less likely unless the enemy chases me specifically.\n3.  Target (0, 8) first, then pivot to the cluster at (4, 4).\n\n**Move Selection:**\nUP is safe and optimal for the closest apple.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n\n**Strategy**\nI am currently at (1, 7). The closest apple is at (0, 8). To reach it efficiently, I need to move UP or LEFT.\n*   If I move UP to (1, 8), the remaining path to the apple is (0, 8) [Left]. The cell (1, 8) is currently empty.\n*   If I move LEFT to (0, 7), the remaining path to the apple is (0, 8) [Up]. The cell (0, 7) is currently empty.\n*   If I move DOWN or RIGHT, I increase the Manhattan distance to the closest apple.\n\nComparing UP vs LEFT:\n*   **UP to (1, 8):** My X coordinate is 1. To reach (0, 8), I will eventually need to go to X=0. The cell (0, 8) is an Apple. The cell adjacent to it horizontally is (0, 8) or (1, 8)? No, (0, 8) is the apple. To eat it, I must land on it. To get there from (1, 8), I must go LEFT to (0, 8).\n    *   **Future Option:** After moving UP to (1, 8), I will be in row 8. Row 9 is immediately above. That is a safe buffer space (Dead end, but safe for 1 turn if needed).\n*   **LEFT to (0, 7):** My X coordinate becomes 0. To reach (0, 8), I must go UP. The cell (0, 8) is the Apple. The cell (0, 9) is above the apple.\n    *   **Future Option:** If I go LEFT to (0, 7), I am pinned against the left wall. If the enemy decides to chase me (unlikely but possible), I have fewer escape routes. However, I have 0 body parts, so I can turn around if I haven't eaten.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 8: `A . . . . . . . . .`\nIf I go **UP** to (1, 8), I am next to the apple at (0, 8).\nIf I go **LEFT** to (0, 7), I am below the apple at (0, 8).\n\nWhich is safer?\nIf I go UP to (1, 8):\n*   Next turn, I can go LEFT to (0, 8) to eat the apple. Or I can go UP to (1, 9) to check for future apples or dodge.\n*   The cell (1, 8) is empty.\n*   The cell (0, 8) is an Apple (safe to land on).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 7):\n*   Next turn, I can go UP to (0, 8) to eat the apple.\n*   The cell (0, 7) is empty.\n*   The cell (0, 8) is an Apple.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1, 6):\n*   I am on the same row as the enemy head (7, 6).\n*   This increases the risk of a head-on collision if the enemy moves aggressively LEFT.\n*   Distance to apple (0, 8) becomes |1-0| + |6-8| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n*   Current distance is 2.\n*   This is strictly worse.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 7):\n*   Distance to apple (0, 8) becomes 3.\n*   Worse.\n\n**Decision:** Between UP and LEFT, UP seems slightly better because it keeps me further away from the potential path of the enemy (who is on Y=6) and moves me onto Y=8, where there is more open space (Row 9 is empty).\nAlso, the apple at (0, 8) is at the corner. Moving UP to (1, 8) puts me in position to grab it next turn.\nThe enemy is at (7, 6). They are unlikely to reach me at (1, 8) in one turn.\n\nLet's confirm the \"last move\" history.\nLast move was UP. Current head is (1, 7).\nThis implies I moved UP from (1, 6) to (1, 7).\nWait, the previous turn state (implied) had me at (1, 6).\nCurrent state: \"Head: (1, 7)\". \"Last move: UP\".\nThis confirms I am at (1, 7) after moving UP.\n\nSo, I am at (1, 7).\nApple at (0, 8).\nDistance: 2.\nMove UP to (1, 8). Distance becomes 1 (Manhattan distance to apple is 1).\nMove LEFT to (0, 7). Distance becomes 2.\n\nActually, if I am at (1, 7) and I move UP to (1, 8):\n*   Distance to (0, 8) becomes |1-0| + |8-8| = 1.\n*   Next turn I can easily eat it.\n*   If I move LEFT to (0, 7):\n*   Distance to (0, 8) becomes |0-0| + |7-8| = 1.\n*   Next turn I can easily eat it.\n\nWhy choose UP over LEFT?\n1.  **Enemy Position:** Enemy is at (7, 6). If they move UP, they go to (7, 7). If they move LEFT, they go to (6, 6). They are moving horizontally mostly (last turn they might have moved right from 6,6 to 7,6? No, body was (6,6) and head is (7,6). So they moved right).\n2.  **Board Geometry:** (1, 8) is near the top border. (0, 7) is near the left border.\n3.  **Head-on Collision Risk:**\n    *   If I go UP to (1, 8), enemy at (7, 6).\n    *   If I go LEFT to (0, 7), enemy at (7, 6).\n    *   The enemy is too far to collide with me in either case.\n\nIs there any apple at (1, 9) or (0, 9)? The board shows row 9 is all dots.\nSo (1, 8) and (0, 7) are both empty.\n\nLet's look at the enemy again.\nHead: (7, 6).\nBody: [(6, 6)].\nPossible moves:\n- UP (7, 7)\n- DOWN (7, 5)\n- LEFT (6, 6) -> Into own body. DIES.\n- RIGHT (8, 6)\n\nSo Enemy cannot move LEFT. They can only move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\nSince they cannot move LEFT, they are moving away from me or staying on the same vertical column but not moving towards me horizontally.\nI am at (1, 7).\nIf Enemy moves UP (7, 7), we are on same Y=7.\nIf Enemy moves DOWN (7, 5), we are separated.\nIf Enemy moves RIGHT (8, 6), we are separated.\n\nIf I move UP to (1, 8):\n*   I am at Y=8.\n*   Enemy is at Y=6. If they move UP, they are at Y=7. Still separated.\n*   If they move RIGHT, they are at Y=6.\n*   Safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 7):\n*   I am at Y=7.\n*   Enemy can move UP to (7, 7).\n*   If Enemy moves UP, we are both at Y=7. Distance is 7.\n*   Safe.\n\nBoth are safe.\nWhy prefer UP?\nIn the previous turn, I was at (1, 6). I moved UP to (1, 7).\nThis turn, moving UP to (1, 8) continues the ascent.\nMoving LEFT to (0, 7) deviates.\nThe apple at (0, 8) requires being at (0, 8) or adjacent.\n(1, 8) is adjacent to (0, 8).\n(0, 7) is adjacent to (0, 8).\nBoth are good.\nHowever, (1, 8) allows me to enter row 8, which is very open.\n(0, 7) puts me against the wall.\nIf I take the wall, I have fewer moves next turn (cannot go LEFT).\nIf I take (1, 8), I can go UP (to 9), LEFT (to 0,8), DOWN (to 1,7), or RIGHT (to 2,8).\nHaving more options is better.\nSo, (1, 8) is the better tactical position than (0, 7).\n\nPlan:\nMove UP to (1, 8).\nThis positions me to eat the apple at (0, 8) next turn.\nIt also keeps me out of the wall.\n\nOne final check on the enemy.\nThey have 1 apple. I have 0.\nThey are likely hunting.\nTheir closest apple might be (7, 6) (wait, that's their position... no, apples are at (0,8), (4,1), (8,4), (4,4), (4,3)).\nWait, the board state shows \"Apples at: (0, 8), (4, 1), (8, 4), (4, 4), (4, 3)\".\nLet's look at the board representation again.\nRow 6: ` . . . . . .

No, (0, 7) is corner-adjacent, (1, 8) is corner-adjacent.\nBut (1, 8) is better.\n\nThe prompt mentions \"Snake #1 - Head: (7, 6), Body: [(6, 6)]\".\nThis body is at (6, 6).\nMy path is nowhere near there.\n\nDecision is UP.\n\n```text\nUP\n```",

This is generally safer for long-term survival.\n    *   The apple at (0,8) is very close. I should move to claim it.\n    *   `DOWN` is slightly safer than `LEFT` because it doesn't trap me against the wall immediately.\n    *   However, `LEFT` is the most direct path to the apple.\n    *   Let's look at `DOWN` to (1,8). From there, I can go `LEFT` to (0,8) to eat the apple. This is a safe 2-step plan.\n    *   Is there a threat? Snake #1 at (8,5).

The board shows '1' at (5) and 'T' at (6)? No, looking at the board:\n        ```\n         5 . . . . . . . . 1 .\n         6 . . . . . . . . T .\n        ```\n        This visual representation suggests the head is at (8,5) and tail is at (8,6).\n        So (8,6) is occupied by the enemy body.\n        If Snake #1 moves UP, they go to (8,6) which is their own body -> they die.\n        If Snake #1 moves DOWN, (8,4). There is an apple at (8,4). They might eat it.\n        If Snake #1 moves LEFT/RIGHT, they move horizontally.\n        None of these moves threaten (1,9).\n\n    *   So, the safest moves are LEFT and DOWN.\n    *   `DOWN` is better than `LEFT` because it avoids the immediate corner at (0,9). From (1,8), I have more mobility. I can get the apple tomorrow.\n\n    *   **Wait, looking at the prompt again:** \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used.

Distance is large. No collision risk.\n    *   **Safety Check:** Self collision? No body.\n    *   **Safety Check:** Walls? No.\n\n    *   **Plan:** Move DOWN to (1,8).

My body will be at (1, 9) from the previous move.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 is at Head (8, 4), Body [(8, 5), (8, 6)]. They are effectively static or moving locally in the bottom right, posing no immediate threat.\n*   **Apples:** The apple at (0, 8) is the closest target.\n    *   Distance from my current head (1, 8) to (0, 8) is **1**.\n*   **Move Evaluation from (1, 8):**\n    *   **LEFT:** Target cell is (0, 8). There is an apple there. This move is safe (no obstacles in that cell). It is also the direction of the nearest apple.\n    *   **UP:** Target cell (1, 9). My tail is currently at (1, 9) from my previous move. Since I am moving simultaneously, my tail will move away just as I move up. However, if I move UP, I am moving back into the cell I just vacated. This is effectively moving \"backwards\" into my own body path, but since my tail moves, it might be safe *if* the tail moves out of the way first. **Correction/Standard Rule Check:** If a snake moves forward, the tail vacates the last cell. If the snake turns around (UP after DOWN), the head moves into the cell the body was just in. In simultaneous movement, if the body segment moves out, the head moves in. Usually, turning 180 degrees is illegal because the segment behind the head (the neck) is considered occupied even if it moves. However, in the specific Snake game logic described in previous turns (Turn 3 Rationale: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself\"), moving back into the cell just vacated by the head is usually allowed *if* the body moves out. **Wait**, I am currently at (1,8). I came from (1,7) or (1,9)? No, the history says: Last turn (Turn 3) I moved DOWN to (1,8) from (1,9)? No, the Turn 3 logic says \"My Head: (1,9)\" and I moved \"DOWN\" to (1,8). So my current position is (1,8). My body is (1,9). If I move UP to (1,9), I am moving back into my previous position (which is now occupied by my body). Since my body segment at (1,9) will move to (1,8) (if I continue) or elsewhere, but moving UP into the body segment behind me is distinct from moving DOWN. Actually, I am at (1,8), body at (1,9). I am facing UP? No, I am facing? The move was DOWN, so I am at (1,8) facing DOWN (if I continued) or I turned? I just moved DOWN. My body is at (1,9) (above me). To go UP is to go back where I came from. The cell (1,9) is occupied by my body. So **UP is fatal**.\n    *   **RIGHT:** (2, 8). Safe, but moves away from the apple.\n    *   **DOWN:** (1, 7). Safe, but moves away from the apple.\n\n*   **Decision:**\n    *   The target is (0, 8).\n    *   Moving **LEFT** takes me directly to the apple.\n    *   Moving LEFT is safe because (0, 8) is an apple, not a wall or snake.\n    *   I will collect the apple and grow.\n    *   Future options: From (0, 8), I can go DOWN to (0, 7) to potentially target (3, 0) or other apples, or go DOWN towards (0,0).\n    *   Safety: No enemy snakes nearby. No walls.\n    *   I will move **LEFT**.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Position Update:**\n*   **Previous State (Turn 9):** Head at (0, 4), Body at [(0, 5), (0, 6)].\n*   **Last Move:** DOWN.\n*   **Current State (Turn 10):**\n    *   Old Tail (0, 6) moved to (0, 5).\n    *   Old Body (0, 5) moved to (0, 4).\n    *   Old Head (0, 4) moved to (0, 3).\n    *   **New Head:** (0, 3).\n    *   **New Body:** [(0, 4), (0, 5)].\n\n**2. Snake State:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):** Head (0, 3), Body [(0, 4), (0, 5)].\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head (4, 2), Body [(4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)].\n    *   *Note on Board Discrepancy:* The board visual shows a `1` at (4, 3), but the text lists the body as starting at (4, 3). Since the head moved from (4, 3) to (4, 2), the body follows, so the tail becomes (7, 4) and the occupied cells are (4, 2) through (6, 4). The board drawing might lag the head movement visualization slightly.\n\n**3. Move Evaluation (from Head at 0, 3):**\n*   **LEFT:** Target (-1, 3). **Off Board** -> **DEAD**.\n*   **UP:** Target (0, 4).\n    *   Occupied by my body.\n    *   My tail is at (0, 5). If I move UP, my tail moves to (0, 4).\n    *   However, if I eat an apple, my tail stays, and I survive. If I don't eat, I die.\n    *   Are there apples at (0, 4)? No. The apple was at (0, 3) (which I just ate/walked onto?).\n    *   *Correction:* The prompt shows Apples at (4, 1), (3, 0), (9, 7), (7, 3), (7, 7).\n    *   **WAIT:** The previous turn's analysis mentioned an apple at (0, 3). The current apple list does NOT list (0, 3). This means I likely ate the apple at (0, 3) on the last move.\n    *   Since I grew, my tail (0, 5) will **not** move this turn.\n    *   Target (0, 4) is occupied by my body.\n    *   Moving UP moves my head into my body at (0, 4).\n    *   **UP is DEATH.**\n*   **DOWN:** Target (0, 2). Is it empty? Yes. Is it on board? Yes. **Safe.**\n*   **RIGHT:** Target (1, 3). Is it empty? Yes. Is it on board? Yes. **Safe.**\n\n**4. Strategy & Safety Check:**\n*   **Safe Moves:** DOWN, RIGHT.\n*   **Enemy Head:** Currently at (4, 2).\n    *   Enemy can move to (4, 1) [Apple], (4, 3) [Body], (3, 2), (5, 2).\n    *   It cannot reach (0, 2) or (1, 3) this turn.\n*   **Long-term:** There is an apple at (3, 0). Moving DOWN to (0, 2) gets me closer to that apple and maintains my position on the left edge. Moving RIGHT to (1, 3) moves me away from the (3, 0) apple and into the center.\n*   **Risk:** If I go DOWN to (0, 2), I am setting up to go to (0, 1) or (0, 0) next. (0, 1) is occupied by an apple (based on the list, though the board shows `(7, 3)`? Wait, the list says `(7, 3)` is an apple. The board shows an `A` at (7, 3) but also shows an `A` at (4, 1) and (3, 0). There is no `A` shown at (0, 1) or (0, 0) in the grid, but the list says `(3, 0)`. The grid shows an `A` at column 2, row 0? No, the grid bottom row is `0 . . . A . . . . . .`. That's (3, 0). The bottom row column 0 is `0` (my body? No, my body is at 0,3, 0,4...).\n    *   Let's re-read the board:\n        *   Row 0: `. . . A . . . . . .` -> Apple at (3, 0).\n        *   Row 1: `. . . . A . . . . .` -> Apple at (4, 1).\n    *   My target for the immediate future is the apple at (3, 0) or (4, 1).\n    *   Going DOWN to (0, 2) keeps the path to (3, 0) open.\n    *   Going RIGHT to (1, 3) is okay, but I'm further from the apples.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving DOWN to (0, 2) is safe and positions me to go for the apple at (3, 0) or (4, 1). I must avoid going UP or LEFT.\n\nDOWN",

The tail moves to (0, 3). The next segment moves to (0, 4). So after I move UP, my head would be at (0, 3), and my body would be [(0, 4), (0, 3)].

This is the shortest path to an apple.\n    *   **Safety:** I am in the bottom-left corner. This is a \"dead end\" if I go further, but currently, I am just \"snaking\" along the edge. If I eat the apple at (3, 0), I grow, giving me more tail length to maneuver.\n    *   **Enemy Snake #1:** He is currently at (3, 1) or potentially moving. If he stays at (3, 1), he blocks the apple at (4, 1) and (3, 0). If he moves to (3, 0), he gets it before me (he is adjacent). If he moves to (4, 1), (3, 0) becomes free for me in 2 turns.\n    *   **Contingency:** If Snake #1 goes for (3, 0), I should turn towards the apple at (7, 1). From (0, 0), I can go UP to (0, 1) (retracing) or RIGHT to (1, 0).\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **DOWN** to (0, 0) commits me to the bottom edge, which is often risky. However, the apple at (3, 0) is very close. If Snake #1 does not eat it immediately, I can secure it.\nHowever, looking at the board state carefully:\n*   Snake #1 is at (3, 1) with a long body. He has apples at (4, 1) and (3, 0).\n*   If I go DOWN, I am vulnerable.\n*   Let's reconsider **RIGHT to (1, 2)**.\n    *   From (1, 2), I am safer. I am away from the wall.\n    *   I can chase the apple at (7, 1) (distance 6) or pivot to (3, 0) (distance 4).\n    *   Most importantly, avoiding the corner keeps escape routes open.\n\n*Correction on Previous Turn's Logic:* The last move was DOWN to (0, 1). The rationale was to chase (3, 0). That puts me at (0, 1) now. If I go DOWN again to (0, 0), I am fully committing to the bottom edge. If Snake #1 decides to come down, I have no escape. However, looking at the board, the center is full of Snake #1's body. If I go CENTER, I might box myself in against his body.\n\nLet's look at the target **(7, 1)**. It is on the left side of the board, somewhat central. From (0, 1), I can't reach it fast.\nLet's look at **(3, 0)**. It is the closest. I am at (0, 1). I need to go DOWN to (0, 0), then RIGHT.\nThis is a \"corner hunt\". It is dangerous.\n**BUT**, there is a safer path. What if I go **RIGHT to (1, 2)**?\nFrom (1, 2), I can go DOWN to (1, 1) -> (1, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (3, 0).\nThis path is slightly longer but keeps my head away from the wall until the last moment, allowing reaction to Snake #1.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the \"Down\" path.\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 0), I am trapped if Snake #1 moves left or down.\nSnake #1 is at (3, 1). He is unlikely to come all the way to (0, 0).\nHowever, to get the apple at (3, 0), I must go RIGHT eventually.\nIf I go DOWN now, my next move MUST be RIGHT.\nIf I go RIGHT now (to 1, 2), I am safer.\n\nWait, is there an apple at (7, 1)? Yes.\nIs there an apple at (3, 0)? Yes.\nIs there an apple at (4, 1)? Yes (Snake #1 is on it).\nIs there an apple at (7, 7)? Yes.\nIs there an apple at (7, 3)? Yes.\nIs there an apple at (9, 7)? Yes.\n\nThe board is 10x10. I am at (0, 1). I am small (length 3).\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at (1, 2). From there I can go UP to (1, 3) or DOWN to (1, 1).\nIf I go DOWN, I am at (0, 0).\nThe cell (1, 2) is empty.\nThe cell (0, 0) is empty.\nThe cell (1, 1) is currently empty (Snake #1 is at 3,1).\n\nLet's look at Snake #1's potential moves.\nHe is at (3, 1).\nApple at (4, 1) is occupied by his body? No, his head is at (3, 1), body starts at (4, 1).\nWait, the board says:\nRow 1: `0 . . 1 T . . A . .`\nMy head is 0 at (0, 1). Snake #1 head is 1 at (3, 1). The 'T' is at (4, 1). So the apple at (4, 1) is *under* his body? No, the board grid uses letters for bodies. `T` is my tail. `1` is his head. `T` is body. So (4, 1) is a body segment.\nThe apple is at (7, 1).\nSnake #1 is very long. His tail is at (5, 4). He has a vertical line at x=4 from y=1 to y=4.\nSnake #1 is currently blocked from moving LEFT (into my path?) or UP/DOWN.\nHe can move RIGHT to (4, 1)? No, occupied by his body.\nHe can move UP to (3, 2)? Empty?\nHe can move DOWN to (3, 0)? **Empty and has an apple!**\nHe can move LEFT to (2, 1)? Empty.\n\nIf Snake #1 goes DOWN to (3, 0), he eats the apple there. That is highly likely because it is an open space with food.\nIf Snake #1 goes LEFT, he moves toward me? No, he is at x=3, I am at x=0.\nIf Snake #1 goes UP, he moves away.\n\nIf Snake #1 eats the apple at (3, 0), I should not go for that apple.\nI should go for the apple at (7, 1) or (7, 7).\nTo reach (7, 1), I need to go through the center.\nTo reach (7, 7), I need to go up.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 2), I am moving towards the center.\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 0), I am moving away from the center.\nSince Snake #1 will likely eat (3, 0), going DOWN is a waste of time and risks trapping myself in the corner.\nGoing RIGHT keeps options open to pivot to the center apples.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (7, 1). It is blocked by Snake #1's body if he stays put, but he will move.\nActually, the apple at (7, 3) and (7, 7) are good targets.\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 2), I can go UP to (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3)...\nWait, Snake #1's body is at (4, 3), (4, 2).\nThe board shows:\nRow 3: `T . . . T . . A . .`\nRow 2: `T . . . T . . . . .`\nSo x=4 is blocked from y=1 to y=4.\nIf I go to (3, 3), I am adjacent to his body.\nIf I go to (3, 4)? His tail is at (5, 4). (3, 4) is open.\nThis is getting complex.\n\nLet's simplify. I am at (0, 1).\nOption 1: DOWN to (0, 0). (Corner).\nOption 2: RIGHT to (1, 2). (Open).\nOption 3: UP to (0, 3). (Collision).\nOption 4: LEFT. (Death).\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 2), I am safe.\nFrom there, I can go DOWN to (1, 1) -> (2, 1).\nIs (2, 1) safe? Snake #1 is at (3, 1). If he moves RIGHT to (4, 1) (blocked by body) or UP/DOWN/LEFT, (2, 1) is safe.\nIf he moves LEFT to (2, 1), I would be at (1, 2) or (1, 1).\nIf I am at (1, 1) and he moves to (2, 1), I am safe.\nIf I am at (1, 2) and he moves to (2, 1), I am safe.\nIf I am at (1, 2) and he moves to (2, 2)? Safe.\n\nThe main threat is Snake #1 eating the apple at (3, 0).\nIf I go DOWN, I am hoping he doesn't take it. But he is right next to it.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am safer.\nThe apples at (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 7) are all in the top right.\nMy position (0, 1) is bottom left.\nI need to cross the board.\nGoing RIGHT is the correct direction to start the crossing.\n\nIs there any other apple?\n(3, 0) is close.\n(4, 1) is occupied by Snake #1's body.\n(7, 1) is occupied by an apple, but far.\n(7, 3) is an apple.\n(7, 7) is an apple.\n(9, 7) is an apple.\n\nSnake #1 has 5 apples. He is growing long. He is currently length 6 (head + 5 body).\nHe is very long.\nIf he moves, his tail moves.\nHe is at (3, 1). Body at (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4).\nIf he moves LEFT (to 2, 1), his tail moves to (4, 2)? No, tail is (5, 4). The segments shift.\nActually, his body is a vertical line at x=4 (from y=1 to 4) and then right to (5, 4).\nIf he moves DOWN to (3, 0), he eats the apple. He grows. He doesn't move his tail.\nIf he moves UP to (3, 2), he moves his tail.\nIf he moves LEFT to (2, 1), he moves his tail.\n\nIf he eats (3, 0), the path to (7, 1) is open, but I have to cross him.\nHe will likely move to the center.\nMy safest bet to get *any* apple soon is to move towards the apples at (7, 1) etc.\nBut I have no apples near me except (3, 0).\nIf I don't go for (3, 0), I might starve.\nIf I go for (3, 0) and he takes it, I'm stuck at (0, 0) or (1, 1) for no gain.\nIf I go RIGHT, I can pivot.\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 1: `0 . . 1 T . . A . .`\nRow 0: `. . . A . . . . . .`\nThe apple at (4, 1) is under his body? No, `T` is body. So (4, 1) is body. The apple is at (7, 1).\nThe apple at (3, 0) is there.\n\nWait, did I misread the board?\nRow 1: `0 . . 1 T . . A . .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nAt y=1:\nx=0: 0 (My head)\nx=1: .\nx=2: .\nx=3: 1 (Enemy Head)\nx=4: T (Enemy Body)\nx=5: .\nx=6: .\nx=7: A (Apple)\nx=8: .\nx=9: .\n\nRow 0:\nx=3: A (Apple)\n\nSo Enemy Head is at (3, 1). Apple at (4, 1)? No, (4, 1) is T (Body). Apple is at (7, 1) and (3, 0).\n\nMy plan:\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 2), I am safer than (0, 0).\nFrom (1, 2), I can reach (3, 0) in 3 moves (1,2)->1,1->2,1->3,0) or (1,2)->2,2->3,2->3,1? No, (3,1) is enemy.\nPath to (3, 0): (1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (3, 0).\nEnemy is at (3, 1). If he goes DOWN, he gets it first.\nIf he goes UP, he leaves it.\nIf he goes LEFT, he comes to (2, 1).\nIf I am at (1, 2), and he goes LEFT to (2, 1), I am at (1, 2) (safe).\nIf I am at (1, 1), and he goes LEFT to (2, 1), I am at (1, 1) (safe).\nIf I am at (1, 1), and he goes DOWN to (3, 0), I am at (1, 1).\nIf I am at (2, 1), and he goes DOWN to (3, 0), I am at (2, 1).\nIf I am at (3, 0), I eat the apple.\n\nThe difference between DOWN (to 0,0) and RIGHT (to 1,2) is significant.\nDOWN puts me in a corner. My only way out is (1,0).\nRIGHT puts me in open space.\n\nIf I go DOWN, my next moves are constrained.\nIf I go RIGHT, my next moves are flexible.\nI will choose RIGHT.\n\nWait, there is an apple at (7, 1).\nDistance from (0, 1) to (7, 1) is 7.\nDistance from (0, 1) to (3, 0) is 4.\nDistance from (0, 1) to (7, 7) is 7 (dist) + 6 (dist) = 13.\nDistance from (0, 1) to (7, 3) is 7 + 2 = 9.\n\nThe only close apple is (3, 0).\nBut Snake #1 is ON TOP of the path to (3, 0).\nIf Snake #1 moves UP or LEFT, I can go for it.\nIf I go DOWN, I am committed to (3, 0).\nIf I go RIGHT, I can go for (7, 1).\n\nLet's simulate Snake #1's best move.\nHe is at (3, 1). He is long.\nApples: (3, 0) (Down), (7, 1) (Right), (7, 3) (Right/Up), (7, 7) (Right/Up), (9, 7) (Right/Up).\nThe closest apple for him is (3, 0).\nHe can go DOWN to (3, 0) safely? Yes. Nothing is there.\nIf he goes DOWN, he grows.\nIf he goes DOWN, he blocks the path for me (he will be at (3, 0) with body extending up).\nIf he goes DOWN, I should not go to (0, 0).\nIf I go RIGHT, I am safe.\n\nHowever, what if he goes UP to (3, 2)? That is empty.\nOr LEFT to (2, 1)? Empty.\nIf he goes LEFT, he comes towards me. But he is at (3, 1), I am at (0, 1). Distance is 2.\nIf he goes LEFT, he is at (2, 1).\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 2), I am away.\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 0), I am away.\n\nIf he goes DOWN, he is at (3, 0). He blocks that apple.\nIf he goes DOWN, the apple at (7, 1) is still there.\nI am at (0, 1). (7, 1) is far.\nBut there are apples at (7, 3) and (7, 7).\nI need to move towards the center.\n\nIf I go DOWN, I am stuck in the corner if the center fills up.\nIf I go RIGHT, I have options.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (7, 1).\nIs there a path?\n(0,1)->(1,2)->(2,2)->(3,2)->(4,2)->(5,2)->(6,2)->(7,2)->(7,1)\nSnake #1 body is at (4, 2). So I have to avoid x=4.\nPath: (0,1)->(1,2)->(2,2)->(3,2)->(3,3)->(4,3) (Snake body at 4,3) -> (5,3)->(6,3)->(7,3).\nApple at (7, 3) is good.\n\nThe board is mostly open except for Snake #1's wall at x=4.\nI am at (0, 1).\nIf I go RIGHT, I start navigating around the wall.\nIf I go DOWN, I am stuck.\n\nThe only reason to go DOWN is if I am 100% sure I can eat (3, 0) before Snake #1.\nSnake #1 is adjacent to (3, 0).\nI am 4 moves away.\nI cannot beat him.\nTherefore, chasing (3, 0) is a trap.\nI should ignore it and move to open space.\nRIGHT to (1, 2) is the best move.\n\nWait, is there an apple at (4, 1)?\nBoard: Row 1 `0 . . 1 T . . A . .`\nRow 0 `. . . A . . . . . .`\nApple is at (3, 0) and (4, 1) is T (Body). So (4, 1) is NOT an apple. The apple is at (7, 1).\nSo the only apples visible are at the top right and (3, 0).\n(7, 3) and (7, 7) and (9, 7).\nThere is one at (7, 1).\nWait, the prompt says: \"Apples at: (3, 0), (9, 7), (7, 3), (7, 7), (7, 1)\"\nYes.\n\nSo I should go RIGHT.\n\nIs (1, 2) safe?\nBoard state for (1, 2): Row 2 shows `T . . . T . . . . .`\nMy head is (0, 1). My body is (0, 2), (0, 3).\nSo (1, 2) is empty.\nEnemy is at (3, 1).\nIf enemy moves UP to (3, 2), he is safe.\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (2, 1), he is safe.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (3, 0), he is safe.\nIf enemy moves RIGHT (blocked by his body).\n\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (2, 1), and I move RIGHT to (1, 2), no collision.\nIf enemy moves UP to (3, 2), and I move RIGHT to (1, 2), no collision.\n\nSo RIGHT is safe.\n\nWhat about DOWN?\n(0, 0) is empty.\nIf enemy moves... he can't reach (0, 0).\nSo DOWN is also safe.\n\nWhy prefer RIGHT?\nBecause I am chasing apples at (7, ...).\nGoing DOWN moves me away from them.\nGoing RIGHT moves me towards them.\nGoing RIGHT also avoids the \"corner trap\".\nEven if I decide to go for the bottom apple later, I can loop back. But it's unlikely to be there if Snake #1 takes it.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT.\n\nWait, look at the board again.\nRow 1: `0 . . 1 T . . A . .`\nIs it possible the apple at (7, 1) is blocked by something?\nRow 1: Index 7 is 'A'. Index 4 is 'T'. Index 5 is '.'.\nSo (5, 1) is empty.\n(6, 1) is empty.\n(7, 1) is A.\nSo the path along y=1 is clear of his body, but his head is at (3, 1).\nIf he moves RIGHT, he hits his body. So he can't move right.\nSo I can walk on y=1? No, because he is at x=3.\nBut if he moves, he vacates x=3.\nIf I am at (1, 1) or (1, 2), I am fine.\n\nLet's double check the \"Direct Backwards\" rule.\nI am at (0, 1).\nBehind me is (0, 0). Empty.\nUp is (0, 3). Occupied by body.\nLeft is (-1, 1). Off board.\nRight is (1, 2). Empty.\n\nI will move RIGHT.\n\nOne more check: Snake #1 is at (3, 1).\nIf he moves UP, he goes to (3, 2).\nIf I move RIGHT, I go to (1, 2).\nDistance between heads: (1, 2) and (3, 2). Distance 2. Safe.\nIf he moves DOWN, (3, 0). Distance 3. Safe.\nIf he moves LEFT, (2, 1). Distance 2 (Manhattan). Safe.\n\nI am good.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\nFrom (1, 2), I will likely move UP to (1, 3) or RIGHT to (2, 2), depending on where Snake #1 goes. My goal is to reach the cluster of apples at the top right ((7, 7), (9, 7), (7, 3), (7, 1)). I need to navigate around Snake #1's vertical wall at x=4.\n\nMove: RIGHT.\nEND RATIONALE\nRIGHT",

Valid.\n    *   **Self Collision**: The snake body is [(2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1)]. (2, 2) is not in this list.\n    *   **Tail Safety**: The tail is currently at (0, 1). The segment currently at (0, 1) will move to (1, 1) on the next turn (following the segment ahead of it, which is at (1, 1)). The segment at (1, 1) will move to (2, 1). Thus, the cell (0, 1) will become empty, and (1, 1) will become empty (occupied by the tail segment which is vacating it to move to (2, 1)). The move to (2, 2) is not into the tail's current position, and the tail vacates its adjacent cell (1, 1) properly. Safe.\n    *   **Enemy Collision**: Snake #1 is at (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4). (2, 2) is not in their body.\n    *   **Strategic Value**: This move moves towards the central and upper board where apples at (3, 6), (7, 3), (7, 1), (7, 7), (9, 7) are located. It maintains central positioning and avoids the bottom-left corner.\n\n2.  **DOWN**: Target position (2, 0).\n    *   **Board Boundaries**: Valid.\n    *   **Self Collision**: (2, 0) is not in the body [(2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1)].\n    *   **Tail Safety**: The tail is at (0, 1). (2, 0) is distinct.\n    *   **Enemy Collision**: Snake #1 is at (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), etc. (2, 0) is not in their body.\n    *   **Strategic Value**: This moves towards the bottom-left corner, which is a dead end. It moves away from the apples.\n\n3.  **LEFT**: Target position (1, 1).\n    *   **Board Boundaries**: Valid.\n    *   **Self Collision**: (1, 1) is currently in the body (it is the second segment). This is a collision. Illegal move.\n    *   **Result**: Eliminated.\n\n4.  **RIGHT**: Target position (3, 1).\n    *   **Board Boundaries**: Valid.\n    *   **Self Collision**: (3, 1) is not in the body [(2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1)].\n    *   **Tail Safety**: The tail is at (0, 1). (3, 1) is distinct.\n    *   **Enemy Collision**: Snake #1 body includes (3, 1). Moving to (3, 1) would be moving into an enemy body part.

This seems safe, but the previous turn's rationale explicitly stated `LEFT` was `((1, 1))` and a collision. The board state provided lists `2 . . 0 . T`. If `T` is at (2,1), then (1,2) is safe. However, the historical record states `LEFT` caused death. I will trust the explicit \"Result: Eliminated\" from the provided history.\n    *   **RIGHT**: Moves to (3, 2). Snake #1's body includes (3, 1) and (4, 0). It does not include (3, 2). However, the previous turn's rationale stated `RIGHT` was `((3, 1))` and a collision.

Closest ones are at (3, 3) (Right), (3, 6) (Up/Right), and (7, 1) (Down/Right).\n    *   Moving RIGHT takes me adjacent to (3, 3) and towards (3, 6).\n    *   Moving LEFT takes me towards (2, 6) but generally away from the other apples.\n    *   Moving UP opens up the top board.\n    *   My body is currently vertical along x=2. If I go LEFT to (1, 3), my body will be (2, 3), (2, 2). If I then go DOWN to (1, 2), I might trap myself if I'm not careful (depending on exactly where my tail moves).\n    *   However, looking at the apples: (3, 6) is a good target. Moving RIGHT gets me closer.\n    *   Let's look at the board again. (3, 3) is an apple? The row 3 says `. . 0 . . . . A . .`. The apple is at (7, 3). So (3, 3) is just empty space.\n    *   Wait, Row 3 in the visual board: `3 . . 0 . . . . A . .`\n        *   This confirms empty at (3, 3).\n    *   Row 6 in the visual board: `6 . . . A . . . . . .`. Apple at (3, 6).\n    *   So moving RIGHT towards (3, 6) is good.\n    *   Moving UP towards (2, 6) is also good, but (3, 6) is closer if I go RIGHT.\n    *   However, simply checking immediate safety:\n        *   UP: Safe.\n        *   LEFT: Safe.\n        *   RIGHT: Safe.\n        *   DOWN: Unsafe (Body at (2, 2)).\n\n    *   Let's look at the enemy. Snake #1 is at (5, 1). It's moving. It could go UP to (5, 2). Row 2 shows: `. . T . T . . . . .`. At index 4 there is a `T`. That's the body of Snake #1 (based on previous state). So (5, 2) is blocked by Snake #1's body. Snake #1 cannot move UP.\n    *   Snake #1 could go DOWN. (5, 0) is the tail. The board shows `0 . . . T T T . . .`. Wait, Snake #1's tail is at (4, 1) or similar?\n    *   Actually, Snake #1's body is `[(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)]`. Tail is (4, 2).\n    *   Row 2 shows `T` at (4, 2). That's the tail.\n    *   Snake #1's head is (5, 1).\n    *   If Snake #1 moves LEFT to (4, 1), Row 1 shows `1 . . T T T 1 . A . .`. (4, 1) is `T`. Blocked.\n    *   If Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (6, 1), (6, 1) is `A`. Safe for Snake #1, and an apple for me if I get there.\n    *   If Snake #1 moves UP to (5, 2), blocked by its body.\n    *   So Snake #1 is likely moving RIGHT to (6, 1) or DOWN to (5, 0).\n    *   This doesn't affect my move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n    *   Decision: All 3 moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe.\n    *   I want to get apples.\n    *   Apple at (3, 6).\n    *   My x is 2. Apple x is 3.\n    *   My y is 3. Apple y is 6.\n    *   Moving RIGHT is progress.\n    *   Moving UP is progress.\n    *   Moving LEFT moves me away from apples.\n    *   So exclude LEFT.\n    *   Between UP and RIGHT:\n        *   RIGHT: (3, 3). Next moves: Can go UP to (3, 4) towards (3, 6). Or RIGHT to (4, 3) to wrap around? No (4, 3) is empty.\n        *   UP: (2, 4). Next moves: Can go UP to (2, 5) towards (2, 6)? No apple at (2, 6). Or RIGHT to (3, 4).\n    *   If I go RIGHT, I get closer to (3, 6). If I go UP, I just avoid (3, 6) slightly.\n    *   Let's look at the board for Row 4: `4 . . . . . . . . . .`. Empty.\n    *   Row 5: `5 . . . . . . . . . .`. Empty.\n    *   Row 6: `6 . . . A . . . . . .`. Apple at (3, 6).\n    *   So the path UP, UP, RIGHT, RIGHT... or RIGHT, UP, UP...\n    *   Moving RIGHT now puts me at (3, 3). From there, I can go UP to (3, 4), UP to (3, 5), UP to (3, 6) (Apple).\n    *   That's a clear path.\n    *   If I go UP to (2, 4), I can go RIGHT to (3, 4), UP to (3, 5), UP to (3, 6).\n    *   Both are fine.\n    *   However, if I go RIGHT, I am at (3, 3). My body becomes (2, 3), (2, 2).\n    *   If I go UP, I am at (2, 4). My body becomes (2, 3), (2, 2).\n    *   Both seem viable.\n    *   Is there any danger in going RIGHT?\n    *   Enemy snake #1 is at (5, 1). It might go RIGHT to (6, 1).\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (3, 3), I am far away.\n    *   Let's consider the \"Backwards\" rule. My head is (2, 3). My body is (2, 2) and (2, 1). The tail will move after I move.\n    *   If I move RIGHT: Head (3, 3). Body [(2, 3), (2, 2)]. Tail leaves (2, 1).\n    *   If I move UP: Head (2, 4). Body [(2, 3), (2, 2)]. Tail leaves (2, 1).\n    *   If I move LEFT: Head (1, 3). Body [(2, 3), (2, 2)]. Tail leaves (2, 1).\n    *   None of these are backwards moves (backwards would be (2, 2)).\n\n    *   Let's prioritize getting apples. The apple at (3, 6) is the closest vertical apple.\n    *   The apple at (3, 3) does not exist (visual board row 3 confirms empty at index 3).\n    *   The apple at (7, 3) is far.\n    *   So moving RIGHT puts me on the X-axis of the (3, 6) apple. Moving UP puts me one step further away in Y relative to the start of the X-approach.\n    *   Actually, distance to (3, 6) from (2, 3) is `|3-2| + |6-3| = 4`.\n    *   From (3, 3) it is `|3-3| + |6-3| = 3`.\n    *   From (2, 4) it is `|3-2| + |6-4| = 3`.\n    *   Both moves reduce distance by 1.\n    *   However, moving RIGHT aligns my X coordinate with the apple. This simplifies future pathing (just go UP).\n    *   If I go UP, I have to go RIGHT then UP.\n    *   Moving RIGHT seems slightly more efficient for the specific apple at (3, 6).\n    *   Also, Row 3 is empty except for my head and an apple at x=7. Row 4 is empty. Row 5 is empty.\n    *   The board is fairly open.\n    *   Let's verify safety of RIGHT again.\n    *   Target: (3, 3).\n    *   Is it on the board? Yes (0-9).\n    *   Is it my body? Body is (2, 2) and (2, 1). No.\n    *   Is it enemy body? Enemy is at (5, 1), (4, 0)... No.\n    *   Is it a head-on collision? Enemy head is (5, 1). It can move to (5, 2), (5, 0), (4, 1), (6, 1). None are (3, 3).\n    *   So RIGHT is safe.\n\n    *   Let's verify safety of UP again.\n    *   Target: (2, 4).\n    *   Is it on the board? Yes.\n    *   Is it my body? Body is (2, 2), (2, 1). No.\n    *   Is it enemy body? No.\n    *   Is it head-on? No.\n\n    *   Let's verify safety of LEFT.\n    *   Target: (1, 3).\n    *   Is it on the board? Yes.\n    *   Is it my body? No.\n    *   Is it enemy? No.\n    *   Head-on? No.\n\n    *   So we have UP, LEFT, RIGHT as safe.\n    *   Strategy: Move towards the closest apple (3, 6) or (7, 3).\n    *   (3, 6) is closer.\n    *   RIGHT moves towards it.\n    *   LEFT moves away.\n    *   UP moves towards it but doesn't align X.\n    *   RIGHT seems best.\n\n    *   Wait, looking at the enemy tail again. The board shows `1 . . T T T 1 . A . .`.\n        *   The `T`s are at indices 2, 3, 4. This represents the body of snake #1.\n        *   The `1` is at index 5 (Head). Index 6 is `A`.\n        *   The body is listed as `[(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)]`.\n        *   Wait, if head is (5, 1), body is (4, 1), (3, 1)? The list says `(3, 1), (4, 1)`.\n        *   So the body extends from (3, 1) to (4, 1) to (5, 1)? No, the list is head-to-tail.\n        *   Head: (5, 1).\n        *   Next: (5, 0).\n        *   Then: (4, 0).\n        *   Then: (3, 0).\n        *   Then: (3, 1).\n        *   Then: (4, 1).\n        *   Then: (4, 2) (Tail).\n        *   So the body on Row 1: (3, 1) is `T` (index 3). (4, 1) is `T` (index 4). (5, 1) is `1` (index 5).\n        *   This matches the board `1 . . T T T 1`. Indices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\n        *   Index 2 is empty. Index 1 is empty. Index 0 is empty.\n        *   So Row 1 has gaps.\n\n    *   My move RIGHT: (3, 3).\n    *   Enemy move possibilities:\n        *   Up: (5, 2). Row 2: `2 . . T . T . . . .`. Index 4 is `T` (from body `(4, 2)`?). Wait, body has (4, 2). So (5, 2) is blocked by body at (4, 2)? No, adjacent blocks don't count unless the snake occupies that cell.\n        *   Let's check Row 2 visual: `2 . . T . T . . . .`\n            *   Index 2 is `T`. Index 4 is `T`.\n            *   (5, 2) is Index 5.\n            *   So (5, 2) is empty.\n            *   Wait, body is `(4, 2)`. That is (x=4, y=2).\n            *   So (5, 2) is NOT occupied by body.\n            *   However, Snake #1's body is `[(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)]`.\n            *   So (4, 2) is occupied. (5, 2) is free.\n            *   So Snake #1 CAN move UP.\n        *   If Snake #1 moves UP to (5, 2), it is safe from hitting its body. (It enters (5, 2), body becomes (5, 1)... tail leaves (4, 2).)\n        *   If Snake #1 moves DOWN to (5, 0), Row 0 shows `0 . . . T T T . . .`. Index 5 is `T`. (4, 0) and (3, 0) are `T`. (5, 0) is empty.\n        *   So Snake #1 can move DOWN or UP or LEFT or RIGHT.\n        *   RIGHT to (6, 1) is empty (Index 6 is `A`? No, index 6 is `A` in the visual `1 . . T T T 1 . A`. Index 6 is `1`. Index 7 is `A`. So (6, 1) is empty).\n        *   LEFT to (4, 1) is occupied by its body `T`.\n        *   So Snake #1 can move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n    *   None of these target (3, 3).\n    *   So RIGHT is safe.\n\n    *   Let's stick with RIGHT.\n\n    *   Alternative check: The previous turn rationale mentioned \"LEFT and RIGHT are explicitly reported as death\". This was for Turn 15.\n    *   If the game logic is strict about \"Backwards\" (moving into the cell you just left), then:\n        *   I was at (2, 2). My body was (2, 1) and (1, 1).\n        *   Moving LEFT would have been to (1, 2).\n        *   Moving RIGHT would have been to (3, 2).\n        *   Neither is the body cell (2, 1) or (1, 1).\n        *   So the \"Death\" message in the history is confusing.\n        *   But it doesn't matter for *this* turn.\n        *   For *this* turn, I am at (2, 3). Body is (2, 2), (2, 1).\n        *   Moving DOWN is death (into (2, 2)).\n        *   Moving UP is safe.\n        *   Moving LEFT is safe.\n        *   Moving RIGHT is safe.\n\n    *   Target: Apple at (3, 6).\n    *   Path: RIGHT, UP, UP, UP.\n    *   Start: RIGHT.\n\n    *   Target: Apple at (7, 7).\n    *   Path: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP...\n    *   Start: RIGHT.\n\n    *   Target: Apple at (7, 3).\n    *   Path: RIGHT...\n    *   Start: RIGHT.\n\n    *   Moving RIGHT seems like the best move to start any approach to the apples in the right half of the board.\n\n    *   Long term plan: Move towards the apple at (3, 6). Avoid the bottom area where the enemy snake is.\n\n    *   One final check. Is (3, 3) truly empty?\n    *   Board Row 3: `. . 0 . . . . A . .`\n    *   Indices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n    *   Index 3 is `.`. Yes.\n\n    *   Final decision: RIGHT.\n\n    *   Wait, let me re-read the \"Last Move Rationale\" from the prompt.\n    *   It says:\n        *   **LEFT**: `(1, 2)`. Result: Eliminated. (Body collision).\n        *   **RIGHT**: `(3, 1)`. Result: Eliminated. (Body collision).\n        *   **DOWN**: `(2, 1)`. Result: Eliminated.\n        *   **UP**: `(2, 3)`. Result: Safe.\n    *   This was Turn 15.\n    *   My body at start of Turn 15 was `[(2, 2), (2, 1)]`.\n    *   Wait, the prompt says: \"Your snake (ID: 0): - Head: (2, 3) - Body: [(2, 2), (2, 1)]\". This is the *current* state (Turn 16).\n    *   The \"Last Move Info\" says \"My head is at (2, 2)\" (Turn 15 start).\n    *   So at Turn 15 start: Head (2, 2), Body [(2, 1), (1, 1)].\n    *   If I moved LEFT to (1, 2), I would have hit the body segment at (1, 1)? No, (1, 2) vs (1, 1) is adjacent.\n    *   Wait, the body was `[(2, 1), (1, 1)]`. So (1, 1) is the tail.\n    *   If I moved LEFT to (1, 2), the tail would move to (2, 1)? No, the tail moves to catch up.\n    *   Wait, the \"Last Move Rationale\" says \"LEFT... This seems safe... the historical record states LEFT caused death. I will trust the explicit 'Result: Eliminated'\".\n    *   This AI is confused by its own history.\n    *   But I must play Turn 16.\n    *   Current state:\n        *   Head: (2, 3).\n        *   Body: [(2, 2), (2, 1)].\n        *   Tail is at (2, 1).\n    *   Moves:\n        *   UP: (2, 4). Safe.\n        *   DOWN: (2, 2). Body. Collision.\n        *   LEFT: (1, 3). Empty. Safe.\n        *   RIGHT: (3, 3). Empty. Safe.\n    *   I will choose RIGHT because it aligns with apples.\n\n    *   Strategy Note: \"Move RIGHT towards the apple at (3, 6). This puts me on the correct X coordinate. From there, I can move UP three times. Keep an eye on the enemy snake at (5,1).\"\n\n    *   Actually, looking at the apple at (7, 7). It might be better to go UP first?\n    *   No, (3, 6) is closer.\n    *   Let's go RIGHT.\n\n    *   Wait, I notice the apple at (9, 7) and (7, 7). These are top right.\n    *   The apple at (3, 6) is center.\n    *   The apple at (7, 3) is middle-right.\n    *   The apple at (7, 1) is bottom-right.\n    *   My current position is (2, 3). Bottom-left area.\n    *   The enemy is at (5, 1). Bottom-center.\n    *   If I go RIGHT, I head towards the center. If I go UP, I head towards the top-center.\n    *   The top-center has no apples (Row 6 has an apple at x=3).\n    *   So RIGHT is better than UP for reaching (3, 6).\n    *   Is LEFT useful? (2, 6) is empty. No apple there. So LEFT is useless.\n    *   So the choice is between UP and RIGHT.\n    *   RIGHT is better.\n\n    *   One risk check: If I move RIGHT to (3, 3), and the enemy moves UP to (5, 2), no collision.\n    *   If the enemy moves RIGHT to (6, 1), no collision.\n    *   If the enemy moves DOWN to (5, 0), no collision.\n    *   Is there any snake at (3, 3)? No.\n    *   Is there any snake at (3, 2)? No.\n    *   Is there any snake at (4, 3)? No.\n\n    *   So RIGHT is safe.\n\n    *   Let's write the plan.\n    *   \"Move RIGHT to (3, 3). This aligns my X coordinate with the apple at (3, 6). From there, I will move UP to collect it. This avoids the enemy snake at (5, 1) and opens up the board.\"\n\n    *   Wait, I should double check the \"Last Move Info\" again.\n    *   It says \"LEFT... Result: Eliminated\".\n    *   It also says \"RIGHT... Result: Eliminated\".\n    *   This implies that in Turn 15, if I had chosen LEFT or RIGHT, I would have died.\n    *   Why?\n    *   Maybe the enemy moved?\n    *   Or maybe my body extended?\n    *   Or maybe the \"Backwards\" rule is very strict?\n    *   Let's assume the visual board is correct for *this* turn.\n    *   The visual board for Turn 16 shows empty at (3, 3).\n    *   So I can move there.\n\n    *   I'll proceed with RIGHT.\n\n    *   One last check on the board visual.

This path is open and avoids the enemy.\"\n\n    *   Wait, the apple at (7, 1) is close to the enemy (5, 1).\n    *   The apple at (7, 3) is close to the enemy.\n    *   The apple at (3, 6) is safer.\n    *   Good choice.\n\n    *   Wait, looking at the board again. Row 2: `. . T . T . . . . .`\n    *   The `T`s are at index 2 and 4.\n    *   Index 2 is my tail (2, 2).\n    *   Index 4 is part of Snake #1's body? Snake #1's body has (4, 2). Yes.\n    *   So (4, 2) is occupied.\n    *   This confirms the board state.\n\n    *   I'm confident in RIGHT.\n\n    *   The prompt says \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n    *   I will write the plan, then the move.\n\n    *   Plan: \"Aligning X-coordinate with the apple at (3, 6) by moving RIGHT. The path is open towards the center apple.\"\n    *   Move: RIGHT\n\n    *   One detail: The prompt asks for \"short long-term plan or strategy note\". I'll keep it brief.\n    *   \"Move RIGHT to approach the apple at (3, 6) safely. The center is open.\"\n\n    *   Wait, I should check if there is an apple at (3, 3).\n    *   Row 3: `. . 0 . . . . A . .`\n    *   No apple at (3, 3). Just empty space.\n    *   But getting closer is good.\n\n    *   Let's just write the output.\n\n    *   Plan: \"Move RIGHT to approach the center apple at (3, 6). The way is clear.\"\n    *   Direction: RIGHT.\n\n    *   One last check. Is there any interaction with Snake #1's head?\n    *   Snake #1 Head: (5, 1).\n    *   My Head: (2, 3).\n    *   Distance is 3 in X and 2 in Y. Manhattan distance 5.\n    *   Even if Snake #1 moves towards me, I am safe for this turn.\n    *   My next move is UP or RIGHT.\n    *   If Snake #1 moves aggressively, I can still escape.\n    *   I have plenty of space.\n\n    *   Decision finalized.\n\n    *   Plan: \"Move RIGHT to open up the path to the center apple (3, 6). Avoiding the bottom-left corner.\"\n    *   Actually, simpler is better.\n    *   \"Moving RIGHT to get closer to the apple at (3, 6).\"\n    *   Move: RIGHT.\n\n    *   The prompt says \"Do not mention future directions after it\". I won't.\n    *   I will write the plan and then the move on a new line.\n\n    *   Wait, I see \"Snake #1 - Head: (5, 1), Body: [(5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2)]\".\n    *   If Snake #1 moves UP to (5, 2), it is safe.\n    *   If Snake #1 moves DOWN to (5, 0), it is safe.\n    *   If Snake #1 moves LEFT to (4, 1), it hits its own body (since (4, 1) is in the list).\n    *   If Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (6, 1), it is safe.\n    *   So Snake #1 won't move LEFT.\n    *   This means the column x=4 at y=1 will remain occupied (by the body segment (4, 1)), unless the snake moves UP/DOWN and the tail moves.\n    *   But Snake #1's body at (4, 2) is also there.\n    *   The bottom area is getting crowded for Snake #1.\n    *   I am safe in the middle.\n\n    *   Correct.\n\n    *   Plan: \"Moving RIGHT to (3, 3) to close in on the apple at (3, 6).

Immediate death.\n- If I move RIGHT to (5, 3), I collide with Snake #1's head. According to rules, if two snake heads move into the same cell, both die. Since Snake #1 is likely moving (they have a strategy), this is a high-risk collision. Avoid if possible.\n- If I move UP to (4, 4): Check if (4, 4) is safe.\n  - It's empty on the board (looking at row 4: \". . . . . . . . . .\" based on the ASCII map).\n  - No snake bodies there.\n  - Not outside bounds.\n- If I move DOWN to (4, 2):\n  - Row 2: \". . . . . T . . . .\" - Wait, checking the ASCII map more carefully:\n    - Row 3 (y=3): \". . T T 0 1 . A . .\" so at x=4, y=3 is '0' (my head). At x=5, y=3 is '1' (Snake #1 head).\n    - Row 2 (y=2): \". . . . . T . . . .\" - There's a 'T' at (5, 2), which is Snake #1's body.\n    - So (4, 2) is empty (it's a '.' in row 2, column 4).\n  - Wait, let's confirm the map indices. The ASCII map has rows from 9 (top) to 0 (bottom). The columns are 0 to 9.\n  - For row y=2 (which is the 7th line in the ASCII block): \". . . . . T . . . .\"\n    - x=0: '.', x=1: '.', x=2: '.', x=3: '.', x=4: '.', x=5: 'T', x=6: '.', etc.\n    - So (4, 2) is indeed '.' (empty).\n  - So DOWN to (4, 2) is empty and safe from walls.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safety of UP and DOWN.**\n- **UP (4, 4):**\n  - Is there any snake body there? Map shows '.' at (4, 4).\n  - Is it occupied by another snake's head? Snake #1 is at (5, 3), so if it moves, it could go UP to (5, 4), but that's not (4, 4).\n  - However, I need to predict where Snake #1 might move. Their head is at (5, 3). Possible moves: UP (5,4), DOWN (5,2) but (5,2) is their own body, LEFT (4,3) which is my head (collision risk), RIGHT (6,3).\n  - If I go UP to (4, 4) and Snake #1 goes UP to (5, 4), no collision. If they go LEFT to (4, 3), that's where I'm leaving, so no collision. So UP seems safe regarding Snake #1.\n  - What about other threats? Only one enemy snake.\n  - Future options: From (4, 4), I can explore upwards. There's an apple at (3, 6) which is two steps up and one step left. (7, 7), (7, 3), etc. are farther.\n  - (4, 4) is relatively open.\n\n- **DOWN (4, 2):**\n  - Check occupancy: Map shows '.' at (4, 2).\n  - Snake #1: At (5, 3). If they move DOWN to (5, 2), that's their own body, so they wouldn't (unless suicidal, but we assume they avoid death). If they move LEFT to (4, 3), that's my current head, but I'm moving down, so no collision. If they go UP or RIGHT, safe.\n  - However, looking at the board, (4, 2) is near their body at (5, 2). Not a direct threat unless they move into me, but heads move simultaneously.\n  - Future options: From (4, 2), I can go DOWN to (4, 1) or (4, 0). Looking at map:\n    - Row 1: \". . . T . T . A . .\" so (4,1) is 'T' (Snake #1 body? Wait, at (4,1): let's see the string. The string is \". . . T . T . A . .\" for y=1. Splitting by spaces: positions 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. So:\n      - x=0: '.'\n      - x=1: '.'\n      - x=2: '.'\n      - x=3: 'T'\n      - x=4: '.' (since it's the 5th element, after x=3 'T', then space, then '.' for x=4? Let's count the characters.\n    The string is: \". . . T . T . A . .\" \n    If we consider each character or group: Usually in these maps, it's separated by spaces. So indices: 0:., 1:., 2:., 3:T, 4:., 5:T, 6:., 7:A, 8:., 9:.\n    So at y=1, x=4 is '.' (empty). x=3 is 'T', x=5 is 'T'.\n    - Similarly, row 0: \". . . T T T . . . .\" so x=4 is 'T' (Snake #1 body).\n    So from (4,2), if I go DOWN to (4,1), that's empty. But if I go DOWN again to (4,0), it's 'T' (Snake #1 body). So going DOWN leads me towards the bottom where Snake #1's body is, which might be dangerous if I get trapped. Also, the bottom row has apples? No apples at y=0, but there is an apple at (3,6) which is up, and (7,3) etc. Going down seems away from most apples.\n    - Current apples: (9,7), (7,3), (7,7), (7,1), (3,6). So (7,3) is relatively close in x but y=3, same as my current y. (3,6) is up-left. (7,1) is down-right. So both UP and DOWN are possible directions to apples, but UP seems more promising because (3,6) is directly reachable via UP and LEFT.\n\n**Step 4: Consider apple proximity.**\n- Apples: \n  - (3, 6): Manhattan distance from (4,3) is |4-3| + |3-6| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n  - (7, 3): Manhattan distance is |4-7| + |3-3| = 3 + 0 = 3.\n  - (7, 7): |4-7| + |3-7| = 3 + 4 = 7.\n  - (7, 1): |4-7| + |3-1| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n  - (9, 7): |4-9| + |3-7| = 5 + 4 = 9.\n- The closest apples are (7,3) at distance 3 and (3,6) at distance 4.\n- (7,3) is to the right, but Snake #1 is at (5,3), which is directly between me and (7,3). So moving right towards (7,3) is risky because Snake #1 is there and might move to block or collide.\n- (3,6) is up-left. From (4,3), moving UP gets me closer to (3,6), and then I can move LEFT to (3,4), etc.\n- Also, there's an apple at (7,1), which is down-right, but going down might lead me into the area where Snake #1's body is, which could be risky for future movement.\n\n**Step 5: Check Snake #1's status and possible moves.**\n- Snake #1: Head (5,3), body: (5,2), (5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (3,1).\n- This snake is longer (6 segments) and has 6 apples, so it's growing.\n- Possible moves from (5,3):\n  - UP (5,4): Check if safe. Map row 4 (y=4) is all '.' up to x=9, so empty. Safe.\n  - DOWN (5,2): Occupied by its own body (segment at (5,2)), so death. So it won't go down.\n  - LEFT (4,3): That's my current head. If it moves LEFT and I stay or move, we might collide. Since heads move simultaneously, if it goes LEFT and I go elsewhere, no collision. If it goes LEFT and I go LEFT (impossible), or if I go right into it, etc. But specifically, if it moves to (4,3) and I move away from (4,3), no collision. However, if it moves to (4,3) and I am no longer there, it's fine. But if I move to a cell where it is moving, collision.\n  - RIGHT (6,3): Map row 3 at x=6: \". . T T 0 1 . A . .\" so at x=6, it's '.' (since after '1' there's space, then '.', so (6,3) is empty). Safe.\n- So Snake #1 can safely go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. It cannot go DOWN.\n- Now, if Snake #1 goes LEFT to (4,3), and I am moving from (4,3), then no collision because I'm leaving and it's entering? Actually, simultaneous move: both heads move at the same time. So if I am at (4,3) and move to (4,4), and Snake #1 is at (5,3) and moves to (4,3), then at the end of turn, I am at (4,4) and it is at (4,3), so no collision. But if I moved to (5,3) and it moved to (5,3), both die. Since I'm not moving to (5,3), that's fine.\n- However, if I move UP to (4,4) and Snake #1 moves UP to (5,4), no issue.\n- If I move DOWN to (4,2) and Snake #1 moves DOWN? It can't, as (5,2) is its body.\n- If I move DOWN to (4,2) and Snake #1 moves LEFT to (4,3), then I am at (4,2) and it is at (4,3), safe.\n- So both UP and DOWN seem safe from immediate collision with Snake #1.\n\n**Step 6: Consider future trapping.**\n- If I go DOWN to (4,2):\n  - The area below: (4,1) is empty, (4,0) is Snake #1 body. So I can go to (4,1), but then from there, I might be boxed in by the wall at y=0 and Snake #1's body. Specifically, at y=0, there are bodies at (3,0), (4,0), (5,0). So from (4,1), I can go LEFT to (3,1) which is Snake #1 body? Row 1: (3,1) is 'T' (from the map: \". . . T . T . A . .\" so x=3 is 'T'), so (3,1) is occupied. RIGHT to (5,1) is 'T' (since x=5 is 'T' in row 1). UP to (4,2) is where I came from, but that's my tail after move? After moving down, my body will be: new head (4,2), old head (4,3), then (3,3), (2,3). So (4,2) is head, (4,3) is body. So from (4,1), if I go there next, my possible moves:\n    - UP: back to (4,2) - valid, but I might be circling.\n    - LEFT: (3,1) - occupied by Snake #1 body, death.\n    - RIGHT: (5,1) - occupied by Snake #1 body, death.\n    - DOWN: (4,0) - occupied by Snake #1 body, death.\n  - So if I go to (4,1), I would be trapped and die unless I go back up. So going DOWN risks getting trapped if I continue down. Better to avoid that direction.\n\n- If I go UP to (4,4):\n  - The area is more open. From (4,4), I can go:\n    - UP: (4,5) - likely empty (row 5 is all '.' according to map).\n    - DOWN: back to (4,3) - after move, (4,3) will be my body, so valid but moving backwards? Moving down from (4,4) to (4,3) is moving into my own body? Let's think: After moving UP to (4,4), my body becomes: head (4,4), then (4,3), (3,3), (2,3). So if I then move DOWN, I go to (4,3), which is now part of my body (the segment behind the head). According to rules, \"moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" So moving from (4,4) DOWN to (4,3) is exactly that, because (4,3) is the cell directly behind the head. So that would kill me. So from (4,4), I should not move DOWN immediately next turn.\n    - LEFT: (3,4) - check map. Row 4 (y=4) is all '.'? Map row 4: \". . . . . . . . . .\" so yes, (3,4) is empty.\n    - RIGHT: (5,4) - empty.\n  - So from (4,4), I have three safe directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) for the next move, excluding DOWN which is fatal.\n  - Also, apples: (3,6) is up-left. From (4,4), distance to (3,6) is |3-4| + |6-4| = 1 + 2 = 3. From (4,3), distance was 4. So moving UP gets me closer.\n  - Another apple at (7,3) is to the right, but again, Snake #1 is near there.\n\n**Step 7: Final decision.**\n- Moving DOWN risks immediate trapping in the bottom-left corner where Snake #1's body is. From (4,2), I could go to (4,1), but then I'm stuck between bodies and wall.\n- Moving UP to (4,4) opens up the board, allows movement towards the apple at (3,6), and keeps multiple escape routes.\n- Also, in my last move rationale, I moved RIGHT to align with (3,6)? Wait, that seems odd. Last move was RIGHT, from what? My previous head was probably (3,3) moving to (4,3). The rationale said \"align with apple at (3,6)\", but (3,6) is up-left, not right. Perhaps that was a mistake in the rationale? Anyway, current position is (4,3).\n- Given that, moving UP seems the best choice to continue towards (3,6) or other apples in the upper board.\n\nTherefore, I choose UP.\n\nUP",

No collision.\n    *   If Snake #1 moves **RIGHT** to (6, 6): No collision.\n\n**Comparison of LEFT vs UP**:\n*   **LEFT (to 3, 6)**:\n    *   **Pros**: Eats an apple immediately (+1 Score). Directly targets the closest apple. Clears the path to the left side of the board. Snake #1 is moving away (likely to the right/east) or staying, so we are separating.\n    *   **Cons**: None immediately obvious.\n*   **UP (to 4, 7)**:\n    *   **Pros**: Safe. Positions me towards the top apples.\n    *   **Cons**: Misses the immediate apple at (3, 6). Snake #1 is at (5, 6). If I go UP, I am at (4, 7). If Snake #1 goes UP, they are at (5, 7). We remain close.\n    *   **Tactical Risk**: If I go UP, Snake #1 might move UP or LEFT. If Snake #1 moves LEFT to (4, 6), and then I want to go for the apple next turn, I might have to maneuver around them.\n\n**Strategy**:\nThe primary goal is to eat apples to catch up (Snake #1 has 6, I have 2). The apple at (3, 6) is guaranteed safe to take this turn. Taking it increases my score and length. Given that Snake #1 is adjacent and likely moving away or parallel, taking the apple is the high-value, low-risk play.\n\n**Long-term Plan**:\nEat the apple at (3, 6). After eating, my tail will be at (4, 4). My body will be (4, 6) and (4, 5). From (3, 6), check the board. There are apples at (7, 1), (7, 3), (7, 7), (9, 7). The apples on the right side (x=7, x=9) are clustered and likely worth more long-term. I will likely need to navigate towards the right side eventually. My immediate next move after eating will likely be UP to (3, 7) or exploring (2, 6), then finding a path around the center.\n\nFinal decision: Eat the apple.\n\nLEFT",

Wait, let's trace.\n    - Old: Head (3, 6), Body (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4).\n    - Move UP: Head moves to (3, 7).\n    - Body follows: The segment at (4, 6) moves to (3, 6). The segment at (4, 5) moves to (4, 6). The segment at (4, 4) moves to (4, 5).\n    - New Tail is at (4, 5).\n    - New Body: (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5).\n    - Is (3, 7) safe? Yes.\n    \n    If I move LEFT to (2, 6):\n    - New Head: (2, 6).\n    - New Body: (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5).\n    - Is (2, 6) safe? Yes.\n    \n    If I move DOWN to (3, 5):\n    - New Head: (3, 5).\n    - New Body: (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5).\n    - Is (3, 5) safe? Yes.\n    \n    Now, let's consider the enemy Snake #1.\n    Head: (5, 6).\n    Body: (5, 5), (5, 4), ...\n    \n    Snake #1 is adjacent to me at (4, 6) (my current body).\n    If Snake #1 moves LEFT to (4, 6), they hit my body. They die.\n    If Snake #1 moves UP to (5, 7), they are safe.\n    If Snake #1 moves DOWN to (5, 5), they hit their own body? No, their body starts at (5, 5).\n        Wait, Snake #1 Body is [(5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4)...] - NO, wait.\n        \"Snake #1 - Head: (6, 6), Body: [(5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1)]\"\n        Wait, the prompt says Head: (6, 6).\n        But the board state shows:\n        Row 6: `. . . 0 T T 1 . . .`\n        Column 5 has 'T'.\n        Column 6 has '1'.\n        So Head is at (6, 6). Correct.\n        The body list starts with (5, 6). That connects to the head (6, 6).\n        \n        So Snake #1 Current Head: (6, 6).\n        Snake #1 Body: (5, 6), (5, 5), ...\n        \n        My Current Head: (3, 6).\n        My Body: (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4).\n        \n        Distance between my head and enemy head: (3, 6) vs (6, 6). 3 cells apart.\n        Distance between my body and enemy head: My body is at (4, 6). Enemy head at (6, 6). They are separated by one cell: (5, 6).\n        (5, 6) is the first segment of the enemy's body.\n        \n        So there is a gap:\n        Me: (3, 6)\n        Me: (4, 6)\n        Gap: (5, 6)\n        Enemy: (6, 6)\n        \n        Wait, the board state says:\n        Row 6: `. . . 0 T T 1 . . .`\n        Index 3: '0'\n        Index 4: 'T'\n        Index 5: 'T'\n        Index 6: '1'\n        \n        So:\n        My Head: (3, 6)\n        My Body: (4, 6)\n        Enemy Body: (5, 6) (This is the \"T\" at index 5)\n        Enemy Head: (6, 6)\n        \n        Enemy #1 Body list in prompt: [(5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), ...]\n        This matches the board. The first body segment is (5, 6).\n        \n        So Enemy #1 is right next to my body.\n        If Enemy #1 moves LEFT, they go to (5, 6)? No, they are at (6, 6).\n        If Enemy #1 moves LEFT to (5, 6), that cell is occupied by their own body (the segment at (5, 6) is there).\n        Wait, the tail moves. The cell (5, 6) will become empty when the snake moves (assuming it doesn't eat).\n        So Enemy #1 CAN move LEFT to (5, 6).\n        If I stay at (3, 6) or move away, (4, 6) is empty.\n        If Enemy moves LEFT to (5, 6), they are safe (it's their body, but the tail leaves).\n        If Enemy moves LEFT to (4, 6), that is MY body.\n        My body is (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4).\n        If Enemy moves to (4, 6), they die.\n        \n        What if Enemy moves UP/DOWN/RIGHT?\n        UP (6, 7): Empty (Row 7 is empty at col 6).\n        DOWN (6, 5): Empty (Row 5 is empty at col 6).\n        RIGHT (7, 6): Empty.\n        \n        So Enemy likely moves UP, DOWN, RIGHT, or LEFT (to 5, 6).\n        If Enemy moves LEFT to (5, 6), they are moving towards the gap.\n        \n        Let's analyze my moves again with this correct map.\n        \n        **Option 1: LEFT (to 2, 6)**\n        - New Head: (2, 6).\n        - New Body: (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5).\n        - Apple?

Row 4 has my body. Row 5 has Enemy body.\n        Row 3: ` . . . . . T . A .

They might be aggressive or just grabbing what's in front.\n        If they are at (6, 6), they might move RIGHT to (7, 6) or UP to (6, 7).\n        \n        If they go UP to (6, 7), they are 1 step away from (7, 7).\n        If I go UP to (3, 7), I am 4 steps away.\n        \n        If I go DOWN to (3, 5), I am 5 steps away from (7, 3) or (7, 1).\n        \n        If I go LEFT, I am 0 steps closer.\n        \n        The only way to win is to take apples.

The prompt says \"Head: (3, 6)\".\n        If there was an apple at (3, 6) and I moved LEFT to (3, 6), that means I was at (4, 6) before.\n        If I ate the apple, my tail would not move (I grow).\n        \n        Let's look at the \"Scores so far\".\n        \"Your snake (ID 0) apples: 3\".\n        \n        The prompt says \"Apples at: ...\".\n        It does NOT list (3, 6).\n        \n        However, the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" claims there was an apple there.\n        Is it possible the \"Apples at\" list in the prompt is the list of apples *remaining* on the board for Turn 22?\n        If I ate the apple at (3, 6) on Turn 21, it would be gone now.\n        \n        So, the \"Apples at\" list is correct for the *current* state.\n        The \"LAST RATIONALE\" is describing a past event (Turn 21).\n        \n        So, for Turn 22:\n        I am at (3, 6).\n        There is NO apple at (3, 6).\n        The closest apples are (7, 7), (9, 7), (7, 3), etc.\n        \n        My analysis holds: UP is the best move to get to (7, 7).\n        \n        What if I go UP and the Enemy goes UP?\n        Me: (3, 7).\n        Enemy: (6, 7).\n        We are 3 cells apart.\n        \n        What if I go UP and Enemy goes LEFT?\n        Me: (3, 7).\n        Enemy: (5, 6).\n        \n        What if I go UP and Enemy goes RIGHT?\n        Me: (3, 7).\n        Enemy: (7, 6).\n        \n        All safe.\n        \n        What about DOWN?\n        If I go DOWN (3, 5).\n        If Enemy goes UP (6, 7), safe.\n        If Enemy goes LEFT (5, 6), safe.\n        \n        What about LEFT?\n        If I go LEFT (2, 6).\n        Safe.\n        \n        But UP is the only one that makes progress toward food.\n        \n        There is one edge case.\n        If I go UP to (3, 7), and then next turn I want to go RIGHT.\n        But what if the Enemy also wants to go to (4, 7)?\n        Enemy is at (6, 6).\n        They are far away.\n        They would need to move LEFT 2 times to get to (4, 6), then UP.\n        It's unlikely they can intercept me at (4, 7) next turn.\n        \n        So, UP seems robust.\n        \n        One detail:\n        The prompt says \"Snake #1 - Head: (6, 6)\".\n        The board shows `1` at column 6.\n        The board shows `T` at column 5.\n        So the snake occupies (5,6) and (6,6).\n        \n        If I move UP, I am at (3, 7).\n        My body moves to (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5).\n        \n        If Enemy moves LEFT, they go to (5, 6) (their body segment moves out).\n        (5, 6) is currently occupied by their body, but will be empty as they move.\n        If they move to (4, 6), they hit MY body. They die.\n        So they won't move to (4, 6).\n        \n        So the path is clear.\n        \n        Final check:\n        Move UP.\n        Target (3, 7).\n        Safe: Yes.\n        Strategic value: High (path to apple).\n        \n        Move DOWN.\n        Target (3, 5).\n        Safe: Yes.\n        Strategic value: Low (path to apple blocked).\n        \n        Move LEFT.\n        Target (2, 6).\n        Safe: Yes.\n        Strategic value: Low (path to apple blocked).\n        \n        Move RIGHT.\n        Target (4, 6).\n        Safe: No (My body).\n        \n        So, UP is the correct choice.\n        \n        Plan: Move UP to get closer to the apples at (7,7) and (9,7). From there, navigate right to eat them. Avoid the enemy who is currently at (6,6).\n\n        One tiny check:\n        The prompt says \"The game ends immediately when any snake reaches 50 apples.\"\n        Snake #1 has 6. I have 3.\n        We are nowhere near 50.\n        \n        The prompt says \"If all snakes die ... game ends\".\n        \n        The prompt says \"If you move onto an apple, you grow\".\n        \n        Is there any chance an apple is hidden?\n        \"Apples at: ...\".\n        I trust the list.\n        \n        Is there any other snake?\n        No.\n        \n        Is there any trap?\n        The board is 10x10.\n        \n        I am confident in UP.\n        \n        One small detail from the \"START LAST RATIONALE\":\n        \"LEFT (3, 6): Contains an apple.\"\n        This was the reasoning for the *previous* move (Turn 21).\n        On Turn 21, I was at (4, 6). I moved LEFT to (3, 6).\n        The prompt implies I ate an apple.\n        My score is 3.\n        \n        Let's assume the \"Apples at\" list is for the *current* turn (22).\n        \n        So, I am at (3, 6). No apple here.\n        \n        I will move UP.\n        \n        Wait, looking at the board again:\n        Row 7: ` . . . . . . . A .

Avoid the enemy cluster on the right side.\n        \n        Move: UP\n        \n        Double check \"moving directly backwards\".\n        My head is (3, 6).\n        My body segment is at (4, 6).\n        Moving LEFT is moving away from (4, 6). Correct.\n        Moving UP moves to (3, 7). Not backwards.\n        \n        Okay.\n        \n        One last check on the \"Apples at\" list.\n        Maybe the prompt implies I just ate the apple at (3, 6)?\n        \"My last move information: ... LEFT\".\n        \"START LAST RATIONALE ...

From there, move RIGHT to collect it.\n        Move: UP\n        Wait, the prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\n        So the plan must be above the move.\n        \n        I will write:\n        Strategy: Navigate towards the apple at (7,7) by going UP and then RIGHT. Avoid the enemy cluster on the right side.\n        UP\n        \n        Wait, I should check if I can go UP twice.\n        Turn 22: (3, 6) -> (3, 7).\n        Turn 23: (3, 7) -> (3, 8).\n        Row 8 is empty.\n        Turn 24: (3, 8) -> (3, 9).\n        Row 9 is empty.\n        \n        I don't need to go to 9.

The apple at (7, 1) is potentially reachable but guarded by the enemy tail.\n4.  **Move Analysis:**\n    *   **UP:** Target (3, 9). The path is clear. This keeps me safe and moves towards the cluster of apples at the top right (9, 7) or (9, 3).\n    *   **RIGHT:** Target (4, 8). The path is clear. This moves me East, potentially towards the apple at (7, 3).\n    *   **LEFT:** Target (2, 8). Safe, but moves me away from the densest apple cluster (top right).\n    *   **DOWN:** Target (3, 7). This is my current body segment (T). Hitting my own body results in death. This move is invalid.\n\n    *   **Conflict Check:**\n        *   If I move **UP** to (3, 9), Snake #1 moves. Currently at (7, 7), it can move UP to (7, 8) or RIGHT to (8, 7). Neither of these lands on (3, 9).\n        *   If I move **RIGHT** to (4, 8), Snake #1 moves. If it moves UP to (7, 8), no collision. If it moves RIGHT to (8, 7), no collision. It is unlikely to reach (4, 8).\n        *   *Correction on Enemy Move:* Snake #1 is at (7, 7). If it moves DOWN, it hits its own body at (7, 6). If it moves LEFT, it hits its own body at (6, 6). Therefore, Snake #1 is restricted to **UP** or **RIGHT**. Both are safe for Snake #1, and neither interferes with my potential moves UP or RIGHT.\n\n    *   **Decision:**\n        *   **UP** moves me to (3, 9). This is the edge of the board, but it is safe. From (3, 9), I can proceed East towards (9, 7).\n        *   **RIGHT** moves me to (4, 8). This is a good central position.\n        *   Comparing (3, 9) and (4, 8), (4, 8) offers more flexibility (can go Left, Right, Up, Down). However, (3, 9) sets me directly on the path to (9, 7) without obstruction. Since the board is 10x10 and I have 126 turns remaining, I can afford to take the direct route to the food.\n\n        The apple at (7, 7) was eaten last turn (based on the board state showing the snake head there but the apple gone, or simply the snake occupying the apple spot). The remaining apples in the top cluster are (9, 7) and (9, 3).\n\n        Moving **UP** is the most direct path to the top row apples. It does not block my future movement (I can turn Right at any point).\n\n        Long-term plan: Navigate towards (9, 7) or (9, 3). Avoid the enemy who is likely heading towards (7, 1) or (7, 3).

It is safe.\n    *   **Enemy Collision (Snake #1):**\n        *   Snake #1 Head: (8, 8)\n        *   Snake #1 Body: [(9, 8), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5)]\n        *   Enemy Move Possibilities: Up (8,9), Down (8,7 - occupied), Left (7,8), Right (9,8 - occupied).\n        *   If I move RIGHT to (7, 9), I am safe from the enemy.\n        *   If I move DOWN to (6, 8), I am safe from the enemy (he is at x=8 or x=9).\n\n3.  **Strategic Evaluation (Safe Moves: DOWN vs. RIGHT):**\n    *   **Option: RIGHT (to 7, 9)**\n        *   **Pros:** Moves me closer to the apple at (9, 9) (if it exists) or just keeps me on the perimeter. Looking at the board, the apples are listed as `(7, 3), (7, 1), (9, 3), (4, 4), (7, 9)`. Wait, the board state shows `0 A . .` at row 9, col 6-9. The apple list says `(7, 9)`. This is a contradiction. The board rendering shows `.` at (7,9) and (8,9) is `A`. Let's double check the board string:\n           `9 . . . T T T 0 A . .`\n           Index 6: 0 (Head)\n           Index 7: A (Potential Apple?)\n           Index 8: . (Empty)\n           Index 9: . (Empty)\n           The \"Apples at\" list includes `(7, 9)`. The board rendering shows `0 A . .` which implies index 7 is A. Let's verify the coordinates. (6,9) is 0. (7,9) is A. (8,9) is . (9,9) is .\n           If the apple is at (7,9), I am at (6,9). Moving RIGHT eats the apple.\n           Actually, looking at the board again:\n           `9 . . . T T T 0 A . .`\n           Counting indices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n           Index 6 is `0` (My Head).\n           Index 7 is `A` (An Apple!).\n           So there IS an apple at (7, 9).\n           Moving RIGHT eats the apple. I grow. This is good.\n    *   **Option: DOWN (to 6, 8)**\n        *   **Pros:** Clears the top row for later movement. Avoids potential collision if the enemy moves UP (Snake #1 could move to (8,9), which is one tile away from my (7,9) if I move right, or (6,9) if I stay/leave). Actually, if I move RIGHT to (7,9) and Snake #1 moves UP to (8,9), we are adjacent but not colliding.\n        *   **Cons:** Misses the apple at (7,9) which is currently free. It is rare to pass up a safe apple.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   **LEFT:** Invalid (hits self).\n    *   **UP:** Invalid (wall).\n    *   **RIGHT:** Safe, eats apple at (7, 9).\n    *   **DOWN:** Safe, but misses apple.\n    *   I should take the apple.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nEat the apple at (7, 9) to grow and increase score. After eating, I will be at (7, 9) with a tail at (5, 9). I will likely need to move DOWN next to avoid the wall and prepare to descend towards the apples at (9, 3) and (4, 4).\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Based on the analysis of the current board state, enemy position, and game rules:\n\n1.  **Current Position:** My head is at (7, 8).\n2.  **Threat Analysis:** The enemy snake is at (9, 9). The previous turn's rationale indicated a risk of head-on collision by moving right. Now, looking at the specific enemy body configuration provided:\n    *   Enemy Head: (9, 9)\n    *   Enemy Body: [(8, 9), (8, 8), (9, 8), ...]\n    *   My Potential Right Move: (8, 8)\n    *   The enemy body *includes* (8, 8). Since the enemy moved into (8, 8) last turn (implied by (8, 8) being the second item in the body list after the head (9,9)? No, the list is Head: (9,9), Body: [(8,9)...]. Wait, the body list is ordered head-to-tail.\n    *   Let's re-read the enemy body: `[(8, 9), (8, 8), (9, 8), ...]` Wait, if the head is (9,9), the body list should start with the segment touching the head. The list says `(8, 9)` is the first body segment.\n    *   My Potential Right Move: (8, 9).\n    *   The enemy body explicitly lists (8, 9) as the *first* segment. This means if I move RIGHT, I will run directly into the enemy's body. This is fatal.\n3.  **Other Directions:**\n    *   **UP:** Off board (y=9 is max). Fatal.\n    *   **LEFT:** (6, 8). The board shows `.` at (6, 8). No immediate collision.\n    *   **DOWN:** (7, 7). The enemy body list includes (7, 7). If I move DOWN, I hit the enemy body. Fatal.\n    *   **WAIT:** Let's re-verify the enemy body list provided in the prompt: `Body: [(8, 9), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6)]`.\n        *   (8, 9) is the segment immediately behind the head (9, 9).\n        *   (7, 7) is part of the body.\n        *   (7, 8) is my current position. (7, 7) is below me. So moving DOWN is into (7, 7), which is an enemy body part. Correct, fatal.\n        *   (6, 8) is to my left. The body includes (6, 6) and (7, 6), but (6, 8) appears empty based on the board rendering `9 . . . T T T 0 1 .` (Row 9) and `8 . . . . . . . . T T` (Row 8).\n        *   Row 8: `8 . . . . . . . . T T`\n        *   Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n        *   (6, 8) is index 6. It is `.`. Safe.\n        *   (8, 8) is index 8. It is `T`. Safe (in the sense that I know not to go there).\n        *   (7, 8) is my head.\n        *   (5, 8) is index 5. It is `.`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** LEFT to (6, 8) is the only safe move.\n\n**Strategy:**\nMove LEFT to (6, 8) to survive. This moves me away from the enemy at (9,9) and keeps me on the board. From there, I can look for the apples at (6, 7) or (4, 4).\n\nLEFT",

UP to (9,10): Off the board - DEADLY\n2. DOWN to (9,8): My own body - DEADLY\n3. LEFT to (8,9): My own body - DEADLY\n4. RIGHT to (10,9): Off the board - DEADLY\n\nWait, this is concerning - all moves appear deadly! Let me re-examine the board state carefully.\n\nLooking at the board representation:\n```\n 9 . . . . T T T T T 1\n 8 . . . . . . . 0 T T\n 7 . . . . . . A T T T\n 6 . . . . . . T T . .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . A . . . . .\n 3 . . . . . . . A . A\n 2 . . . . . . . . . .\n 1 . . . . . . .

All possible moves would kill me. This seems like a game over scenario.\n\nHowever, let me double-check the board representation. Looking at the coordinates:\n- Row 9 (top row): positions 0-9\n- My head is at (9,9) - the very top right corner\n- My body occupies (8,9) and (9,8) - so I'm boxed in\n\nThis appears to be an unavoidable death situation. There are no safe moves available.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nAfter careful analysis, I'm completely trapped in the top right corner with no safe moves available. All possible directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) would result in either going off the board or colliding with my own body. This appears to be an unavoidable death situation.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no valid move that keeps me alive this turn. The game will likely end with my snake dying on this turn.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",
