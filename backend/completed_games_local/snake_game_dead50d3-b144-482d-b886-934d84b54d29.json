          "rationale": "First, I need to assess the current board state. My snake is at (7,3) with no body, so I'm just a single head. The enemy snake is at (9,2) with no body. Apples are at (7,5), (9,6), (3,5), (2,4), and (2,2).\n\nTurn is 0, so no moves have been made yet. I need to choose a move for this turn.\n\nPotential moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nLet's check each move for safety:\n\n- UP: From (7,3) to (7,4). Is this on the board? Yes, (7,4) is within 0-9 for both x and y. Is there any snake body? My body is empty, enemy body is empty, so no collision. Is there an apple? Not at (7,4), apples are at (7,5), etc. So safe, but no apple.\n\n- DOWN: From (7,3) to (7,2). Is this on the board? Yes. But (7,2) has an apple? Looking at the board, at y=2, x=7 is empty? Board shows for y=2: \". . A . . . . . . 1\" so x=2 is apple, x=9 is enemy head. x=7 is empty. So no apple. Also, no snake bodies. So safe.\n\n- LEFT: From (7,3) to (6,3). On board? Yes. Board shows at y=3: \". . . . . . . 0 . .\" so x=6 is empty? y=3 row: positions x=0 to 9: at x=7 it's '0' (my head), so x=6 should be empty. No apples listed there. So safe.\n\n- RIGHT: From (7,3) to (8,3). On board? Yes. Board at y=3, x=8 is empty. No apples. So safe.\n\nAll four directions seem safe immediately. But I need to consider long-term strategy and potential future moves.\n\nApples are at (7,5), (9,6), (3,5), (2,4), (2,2). My head is at (7,3). So, the closest apple is (7,5) directly above, two steps away. Or (3,5) to the left, but that's farther. (2,2) is also left and down.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,2), which is top right. Apples near it: (9,6) is above it, and (7,5) is somewhat close.\n\nSince we move simultaneously, I need to think about what the enemy might do. But I don't know their strategy. However, I should avoid moves that could lead to head-on collisions or cutting off escape routes.\n\nLet me think about future options.\n\nIf I move UP to (7,4), then next turn I can go UP to (7,5) to eat the apple, or LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN. From (7,5), after eating, I'll grow, so my body will be at (7,5) and (7,4) or something. But since I have no body now, if I eat at (7,5), my tail will be at (7,3) or wherever, but since I'm moving, after eating, the new segment is added, so my body will be from (7,5) head, to previous head position (7,4) if I moved up twice, but let's think step by step.\n\nActually, since I have no body now, if I move to an apple, I grow. So after one move, if I move to an apple, I'll have a body. But currently, no apples are adjacent to (7,3). So no immediate apple eating.\n\nApples at (7,5): two steps up. So if I move UP to (7,4), then next move UP to (7,5) I eat the apple and grow.\n\nSimilarly, if I move LEFT to (6,3), then I can go LEFT or UP or DOWN, but apples are not directly close. (3,5) is left and up from there.\n\nAlso, enemy at (9,2). If I move RIGHT to (8,3), I'm closer to the enemy, which might be risky because if the enemy moves towards me, we could collide. But since both move simultaneously, it might not be direct collision unless we choose moves that cause us to meet.\n\nLet's list possible moves and think about their implications.\n\n- UP: to (7,4). This moves me towards the apple at (7,5). From (7,4), I can go UP to eat, LEFT to (6,4), RIGHT to (8,4), DOWN to (7,3) but that would be into my own body? No, because if I move UP to (7,4), my body would be just the head at (7,4), and the tail would be where I was? Actually, since I have no body, if I move to a new position, my body is only the head? No, in snake game, when you move, you leave your tail behind unless you eat an apple. Standard snake mechanics: when you move without eating, your tail moves forward, so the body segments shift. But since I have no body, if I move, I just leave? Actually, with no body, if I move, I just have a head, and no tail, so when I move, I simply appear in the new cell, and the old cell becomes empty. So after one move without eating, I still have no body, just a head at the new position.\n\nBut in the board state, it says \"Body: none\" for my snake, so I assume I'm just a head. So if I move, I just change head position, no body to worry about for collision unless I eat an apple and grow.\n\nIn this game, when you eat an apple, you grow by one segment. So if I have no body and I eat an apple, then after eating, I would have a body? How does the body appear? Typically, when you eat, you add a segment at the tail, but since there was no tail, it might add a segment at the current position, but that doesn't make sense. Let's think carefully.\n\nIn standard Snake, if you start with just a head, and you move to an apple, you grow, so your body becomes two segments: the head and a tail segment. But where is the tail? It should be where the head was before moving? But since you move, and you eat, the growth happens after the move, so typically, the new head is at the apple, and the old head position becomes the first body segment, and the tail doesn't move because you ate, so you add a segment, meaning your length increases by one, so from length 1 to length 2, with the tail still at the original position? But in terms of coordinates, if I start at (7,3) with length 1, and I move to (7,4) which has an apple? No, (7,4) does not have an apple. Only (7,5) has an apple.\n\nSo for now, no apple adjacent, so if I move, I remain length 1 with no body.\n\nBut let's confirm the rules from the description: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point.\" So if I move onto an apple, I grow. Since I have no body, growing would mean I now have a body. Probably, after eating, my snake has two segments: the head at the apple, and the body at the previous head position? But since I moved, the previous head position is where I was, so if I move from (7,3) to (7,4) which has no apple, then no growth. If I move to (7,5) which has apple, then I grow, so from length 1 to length 2, with head at (7,5) and body at (7,4)? But (7,4) is where I came from? In standard snake, when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so you effectively have an extra segment added at the tail. But since I had no tail, it might be that after eating, my body consists of the previous head position, so yes, head at new position, body includes old head position.\n\nIn the board state, when we list coordinates, it's head-to-tail. So if I have head at (7,3) and no body, that means length 1. If I move to (7,4) without eating, then head at (7,4), no body, length 1. If I move to (7,5) and eat, then after move, head at (7,5), and since I ate, I grow, so I must have a body segment. The body should be the position I came from, so (7,4) would be the body? But (7,4) is empty now? No, after moving, the snake is at new positions, so the old position (7,3) becomes empty, but if I ate, I add a segment, so my body should be from (7,5) to (7,4) to (7,3)? But that would be three segments? No.\n\nI think I'm confusing myself. Let me recall standard snake mechanics: when you move, the head moves to the new cell. If there is an apple, the tail does not move, so the snake grows by one segment. If there is no apple, the tail moves one step forward, so the length stays the same.\n\nSo, if you have length L, and you move without eating, the new head is at new position, and the tail moves, so the snake shifts forward. With length 1, if you move without eating, you just have a head at new position, no body. If you move with eating, then after moving, you have head at new position, and since tail doesn't move, but you had no tail, now you have a body? Actually, with length 1, if you eat, you grow to length 2, so the new snake has head at new position, and the tail at the old position? But that would mean the body is between? In terms of coordinates, for a snake of length 2, the head and the tail are adjacent, and the body is just the segment between, but since it's only two segments, there is no \"between\" \u2013 the head and tail are directly connected. So for example, after eating, if I move from (7,3) to (7,5) and eat, I would have head at (7,5) and tail at (7,4)? But (7,4) is where I passed through? No, in one move, I move directly to (7,5), so from (7,3) to (7,5) in one move? That's two steps? No, each move is one cell. So from (7,3), if I move UP, I go to (7,4). To go to (7,5), I need two moves: first to (7,4), then to (7,5). So after first move to (7,4), I have length 1, head at (7,4). Then if I move to (7,5) and eat, I grow, so after that move, head at (7,5), and since I ate, the tail doesn't move, so the snake now has head at (7,5) and tail at (7,4)? But that would mean the body is only from (7,5) to (7,4), so length 2, with one body segment at (7,4)? But in the coordinate list, it would be [(7,5), (7,4)] for head and body? But the description says \"the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one, and the last tuple is the tail.\" So for length 2, we have two tuples: head and tail. So after eating, from length 1 to length 2, the new snake has head at new position (7,5) and tail at old position (7,4)? But old position was (7,4)? No, when I moved from (7,3) to (7,4), I had length 1, so after that move, head at (7,4), no tail? Then when I move to (7,5) and eat, I grow, so now head at (7,5), and I add a segment, which would be at the tail, but since I had no tail, it might be that the body becomes the previous head position? So the new body list is head at (7,5) and tail at (7,4)? But then the snake is connected, so yes, (7,5) and (7,4) are adjacent.\n\nIn this case, for the first move, since I have no apple adjacent, moving to any direction will keep me length 1 with no body.\n\nSo for turn 0, I have to choose a move without immediate risk.\n\nNow, back to strategy. I need to consider the enemy snake. It has head at (9,2). If I move towards the center or towards apples, I might encounter it.\n\nAlso, since the game has 150 turns, and I need to collect 50 apples to win, but currently, apples are only 5, so I need to eat them first, and then more apples will spawn? The problem doesn't specify if apples respawn after being eaten. In standard Snake, apples spawn after being eaten, but here, since it's a multi-apple game, perhaps apples are fixed until eaten, and then new ones spawn? The description doesn't say. It says \"Apples at: (7,5), (9,6), (3,5), (2,4), (2,2)\" and no mention of spawning. But in the win condition, it says \"the game ends immediately when any snake reaches 50 apples\", so there must be more apples spawning. Probably, after an apple is eaten, a new apple appears at a random location? But since it's not specified, I should assume that apples are limited until eaten, and then new ones might appear, but for now, there are only these five apples.\n\nSince the game can last 150 turns, and I need 50 apples, it's likely that apples are continuously spawned, but I don't know the mechanic. From the board state, there are five apples listed, so I should aim to eat them first.\n\nNow, evaluating moves:\n\n- UP to (7,4): This moves me towards the apple at (7,5). From (7,4), I can go UP to eat, LEFT to (6,4), RIGHT to (8,4), or DOWN to (7,3) which is behind me. Since I have no body, moving DOWN to (7,3) would be into an empty cell? But after I move to (7,4), my previous position (7,3) is empty, so moving DOWN from (7,4) to (7,3) is safe, but it doesn't gain anything. So from (7,4), I have three useful directions: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is possible but not beneficial.\n\n- DOWN to (7,2): This is closer to the apple at (2,2) and (3,5)? Not really. (7,2) is on the same row as enemy head? Enemy at (9,2), so same row. If I move DOWN to (7,2), then I'm at y=2, same as enemy. The enemy might move towards me, so we could potentially collide if he moves LEFT and I move RIGHT or something. But from (7,2), I can move LEFT to (6,2), RIGHT to (8,2), UP to (7,3), or DOWN to (7,1). Apples at (2,2) is left, so moving LEFT might be good, but from (7,2) to (2,2) is 5 steps left, and I have to avoid the enemy. Also, there is an apple at (2,4) above, so from (2,2) I can go up to (2,3) then (2,4). But from (7,2), moving LEFT might be long.\n\n- LEFT to (6,3): This moves me towards the apples at (3,5) and (2,4) and (2,2). From (6,3), I can go LEFT to (5,3), UP to (6,4), DOWN to (6,2), or RIGHT to (7,3). From (6,3), going UP towards (3,5) might be good, but (3,5) is at x=3, y=5, so from (6,3), I need to go left and up. Also, apple at (2,4) is close to that direction.\n\n- RIGHT to (8,3): This moves me towards the enemy and the apples at (9,6) and (7,5). From (8,3), I can go RIGHT to (9,3), UP to (8,4), DOWN to (8,2), or LEFT to (7,3). If I go RIGHT to (9,3), I'm very close to enemy at (9,2). If enemy moves UP to (9,3), we would both move into (9,3) and die? But since we move simultaneously, if I move to (9,3) and enemy moves to (9,3), we collide and both die. So that's risky. Also, if I go UP to (8,4), then to (8,5) etc., I might reach (9,6) apple, but that's far.\n\nNow, considering the enemy's possible moves. The enemy is at (9,2). It might move towards apples: (9,6) is above, so UP, or (7,5) is left and up, or (3,5) is left and up, but from (9,2), (9,6) is directly up, so that might be a natural move. Also, (7,5) is at x=7,y=5, so from (9,2), moving UP or LEFT might be good. But since (9,6) is directly above, probably the enemy will move UP to (9,3) or towards that apple.\n\nIf enemy moves UP to (9,3), then if I move RIGHT to (8,3), I'm at (8,3) and enemy at (9,3), so no collision. But if I move RIGHT to (9,3), then we collide.\n\nSo, to avoid head-on collision, I should not move to where the enemy might move if it's likely.\n\nBut I don't know what the enemy will do. However, since the enemy has no body, it has similar options.\n\nAnother thing: I should avoid moving towards the enemy if possible, because it increases risk.\n\nNow, let's think about which move gives me the best access to apples while keeping safe.\n\nThe apple at (7,5) is very close: just two steps up. If I move UP now to (7,4), then next turn I can move UP to (7,5) and eat it. That seems efficient.\n\nThe other apples are farther: (3,5) is at x=3,y=5, which is 4 left and 2 up from my current position? From (7,3) to (3,5): difference in x: -4, y: +2, so Manhattan distance 6. Similarly, (2,4) is 5 left and 1 up, distance 6. (2,2) is 5 left and 1 down, distance 6. (9,6) is 2 right and 3 up, distance 5.\n\nSo the closest apple is (7,5) with distance 2, then (9,6) with distance 5, then the left ones with distance 6.\n\nSo logically, I should go for (7,5) first.\n\nBut is there any risk? From (7,4), if I go to (7,5), I eat the apple. But during that move, if the enemy also moves to (7,5), we collide and die? But is the enemy likely to go to (7,5)? From (9,2), (7,5) is two left and three up, so it might not go directly there. The enemy might go for (9,6) which is closer for him: from (9,2) to (9,6) is 4 up, so distance 4. From (9,2) to (7,5) is distance 5 ( |9-7| + |2-5| =2+3=5). So (9,6) is closer for the enemy.\n\nSo probably, the enemy will move towards (9,6), so up from (9,2) to (9,3), then to (9,4), etc.\n\nIf I go to (7,4), then to (7,5), I might not encounter the enemy.\n\nAlso, from (7,5), after eating, I have length 2, with head at (7,5) and body at (7,4). Then I can go for other apples.\n\nBut let's consider if moving LEFT or DOWN might be better for long-term.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,3), then I can go towards the cluster of apples on the left: (3,5), (2,4), (2,2). But those are far, and there are three apples there, so I might eat multiple quickly. But from (6,3), to reach (2,2), I need to go left 4 and down 1, so 5 moves, but I have to avoid the enemy if he comes left. But the enemy is on the right, so he might not come left immediately.\n\nSimilarly, if I move DOWN to (7,2), I can go left to (6,2), etc., towards (2,2), but (2,2) is at the bottom left, so from (7,2), I can go left along y=2, but there is an apple at (2,2), and also (2,4) above. But from (7,2) to (2,2) is 5 left, so 5 moves, and during that, I might be exposed to the enemy if he moves left.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (9,2), if I move DOWN to (7,2), I'm on the same row as the enemy, so if the enemy moves LEFT, we might approach each other. For example, if enemy moves LEFT to (8,2), then I move LEFT to (6,2), we are not colliding yet, but if I move LEFT and enemy moves LEFT, we could meet if we both go to (7,2) at the same time? But I'm at (7,2) and enemy at (9,2), if both move LEFT, I go to (6,2), enemy goes to (8,2), so no collision. If I move RIGHT and enemy moves LEFT, we could go to (7,2) and (8,2)? No, from (7,2) and (9,2), if I move RIGHT to (8,2), and enemy moves LEFT to (8,2), then we both go to (8,2) and die. So that's a risk if I move towards the enemy.\n\nBut if I move DOWN, I'm not moving towards the enemy directly, but I'm on the same row.\n\nTo avoid risks, moving UP might be safer because it moves me away from the enemy and towards a close apple.\n\nAnother thing: if I move UP to (7,4), then from there, I have multiple options: I can go LEFT to (6,4), which is towards the left apples, or UP to eat, or RIGHT to (8,4) which is towards the right apples. So I keep my options open.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,3), then from there, I can go UP to (6,4), LEFT to (5,3), etc., but moving UP from (6,3) gets me closer to (3,5) but also to (7,5)? (7,5) is from (6,4) I can go RIGHT to (7,4), but that's back, so from (6,3), going UP to (6,4) then RIGHT to (7,4) then UP to (7,5) to eat, but that takes three moves from (6,3) to eat (7,5), whereas from (7,4) it takes one move to eat (7,5). So from current position, going to (7,4) is better for eating (7,5).\n\nSimilarly, for other apples, from (7,4), I can go LEFT to (6,4) then to (5,4) etc., towards (3,5), which is still a long way, but from (7,4) to (3,5) is 4 left and 1 up, so distance 5, same as from (7,3) but I'm closer to (7,5) first.\n\nSo overall, moving UP seems optimal for immediate gain.\n\nBut let's check if there is any immediate danger in moving UP.\n\nI move to (7,4). Is there any snake body? No. Is it on board? Yes. Could the enemy move to (7,4)? From (9,2), to move to (7,4), he would need to move LEFT twice and UP twice, but since he moves only one cell per turn, he can only go to (9,3), (8,2), (8,3), or (9,1) from (9,2). So he cannot reach (7,4) in one move. Similarly, no other snakes. So safe.\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nBut for RIGHT to (8,3), if enemy moves UP to (9,3), we are adjacent but not colliding. If enemy moves LEFT to (8,2), we are at (8,3) and (8,2), so not colliding. But if enemy moves LEFT and I move RIGHT, we might not collide directly. But if I move to (8,3) and enemy moves to (8,3) from (9,3)? But enemy is at (9,2), so if he moves UP to (9,3), he is at (9,3), not (8,3). To move to (8,3), he would have to move LEFT from (9,2) to (8,2) or UP to (9,3) then next move, but in one move, from (9,2), he can only go to (9,3), (8,2), (9,1), or (10,2) which is invalid? (10,2) is outside, so die. So from (9,2), possible moves: UP to (9,3), DOWN to (9,1), LEFT to (8,2), RIGHT to (10,2) which is invalid. So he cannot go to (8,3) in one move. So from (8,3), I am safe from immediate collision with enemy.\n\nBut why risk going right when going up is safer and towards a closer apple?\n\nAlso, if I go right, I might block the enemy's path to the apple at (7,5)? But the enemy might not go for (7,5) anyway.\n\nAnother point: if I go UP to (7,4), I am positioned to eat (7,5) next turn. If I go LEFT, I might go for the left apples, but those are farther, and the enemy might go for them too? But the enemy is on the right, so probably he will go for right apples.\n\nLet's see the apples: (9,6) is close to enemy, (7,5) is close to me, (3,5), (2,4), (2,2) are on left, so might be contested if both snakes go for them, but since enemy is far, I might have time.\n\nBut for now, since I'm at turn 0, and no moves yet, I should take the immediate opportunity.\n\nAlso, considering that if I eat an apple, I grow, which might help in future moves or blocking, but since I'm alone, it might not matter yet.\n\nSo, I think UP is the best move.\n\nBut let's confirm the board coordinates: y increases up, so from (7,3) UP to (7,4), which is correct.\n\nNow, for the response, I need to output only one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nI should not add anything else, but the problem says: \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\" and \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns.\" But then it says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.\"\n\nSo, I can have reasoning before, but the last line must be the direction.\n\nSo, for my response, I'll write my reasoning, then the move.\n\nAlso, for the strategy note, I can include it in the reasoning.\n\nSo, long-term plan: Aim to eat the apple at (7,5) first, then consider the other apples, preferably the cluster on the left since the enemy might go for the right ones.\n\nBut for now, move UP.\n\nSo, I'll go withBased on the current board state, I am at (7,3) with no body, and the closest apple is at (7,5), which is two steps directly above. Moving UP to (7,4) positions me to eat that apple on the next turn, maximizing immediate scoring potential while maintaining safety. All four directions are initially safe, but moving UP avoids potential risks from the enemy snake at (9,2), who is likely to move toward the apple at (9,6) or other right-side apples. This move also keeps multiple future paths open, such as going LEFT toward the apple cluster at (3,5), (2,4), and (2,2) if needed, without restricting mobility.\n\nLong-term strategy: Prioritize eating the apple at (7,5) next turn, then reassess the board to collect remaining apples, focusing on the left-side cluster where the enemy is less likely to be present early on.\n\nUP",

          "move": "UP",
          "rationale": "First, I need to decide my move for this turn. My snake (ID 0) is at (7,4) with no body, so I'm just a single head. The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (9,3) with no body. Apples are at (7,5), (9,6), (3,5), (2,4), and (2,2). The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right.\n\nMy current position is (7,4). I need to choose one of four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. I must consider which moves are safe and which ones might lead to scoring apples or better positioning.\n\nLet's list the potential moves and evaluate them for immediate safety:\n\n- UP: to (7,5). Check if (7,5) is on the board? Yes, x=7, y=5 are within 0-9. Is there any snake body there? My body is empty, enemy body is empty. Is there an apple? Yes, (7,5) has an apple. So, if I move UP, I will eat the apple and grow by 1 segment. This seems beneficial. But I need to ensure that moving there doesn't cause a head-on collision with the enemy. The enemy is at (9,3). Could the enemy move to (7,5) in one turn? From (9,3), the enemy can move to (9,4), (9,2), (8,3), or (10,3) (invalid). So, (7,5) is two left and two up from (9,3), which is not reachable in one move. So, no head-on collision risk. Also, no other snakes or bodies. So, moving UP is safe and allows me to eat an apple immediately.\n\n- DOWN: to (7,3). Check board: (7,3) is on the board. No apple there (apples are at (7,5), etc.). No snake bodies. But is it safe? Probably, but I'm moving away from an apple that is directly above me. Since I can eat an apple by moving UP, DOWN seems less optimal.\n\n- LEFT: to (6,4). On board, no apple, no bodies. Safe, but doesn't gain an apple immediately.\n\n- RIGHT: to (8,4). On board, no apple, no bodies. Safe, but again, no immediate apple.\n\nSo, from immediate safety and scoring perspective, UP is the best move because I eat an apple and grow.\n\nBut I should also consider long-term strategy. The game has 150 turns, and I need to collect 50 apples to win, but there are only 5 apples listed now. Probably, after eating an apple, a new apple might spawn, or there might be more apples later. But based on current information, eating an apple now is good.\n\nAlso, I need to avoid traps or dead-ends. From (7,4), after moving UP to (7,5), I'll have a body segment at (7,4) after growing? When I eat an apple, I grow, so after moving, my head will be at (7,5), and since I grew, my body will include the previous head position? In snake games, when you eat, the tail doesn't move, so you add a segment. Since I had no body before, after eating, I should have a body of one segment? Let's think: I start at (7,4) with no body, length 1. I move to (7,5) and eat an apple. After the move, my head is at (7,5), and because I ate, I grow, so my body now includes the cell I came from, which is (7,4). So, my snake will be: head at (7,5), body at (7,4). So, length 2.\n\nNow, from (7,5), what are my future options? I can move UP to (7,6), DOWN to (7,4) but that would be into my own body? Since my body is at (7,4), moving DOWN from (7,5) to (7,4) would be moving into my own body, which kills me. So, I cannot move DOWN from (7,5) because my body is there. Similarly, I can move LEFT to (6,5) or RIGHT to (8,5). So, from (7,5), I have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is deadly.\n\nSo, by moving UP now, I gain an apple and grow, and from (7,5), I have multiple escape routes, so no immediate trapping.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake: it is at (9,3). It might move towards apples, like (9,6) which is directly above, or (7,5) which is close but not directly reachable. If it moves UP to (9,4), that's safe. Or LEFT to (8,3), etc. I need to avoid head-on collisions. Since we move simultaneously, if I move to (7,5) and the enemy moves to (7,5), we both die, but as above, it's not possible for the enemy to reach (7,5) in one move. So, no risk.\n\nWhat about other moves? If I move LEFT to (6,4), I'm not eating an apple now, but I might be closer to the left apples at (3,5), (2,4), (2,2). But those are far, and the enemy might also go for them? The enemy is on the right, so probably he will go for right apples like (9,6) or (7,5). But since I can eat (7,5) immediately, it seems better to do so.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,4), I'm closer to the enemy, but not directly threatening. From (8,4), I could go to (8,5) and eventually to (9,6), but that might take multiple moves, and I might encounter the enemy.\n\nSimilarly, DOWN to (7,3) moves me away from apples.\n\nSo, overall, UP is the most promising move.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating the apple at (7,5), I should consider moving towards the cluster of apples on the left, since the enemy is likely to focus on the right side. From (7,5), I can move LEFT to (6,5) and then continue left towards (3,5) etc. Alternatively, if new apples spawn, I can adapt. But for now, securing the first apple quickly is key.\n\nAlso, since the enemy has no body, it has similar mobility, so I should maintain awareness of its position to avoid future collisions.\n\nIn summary, for this turn, moving UP is safe, gains an apple, and sets me up for future moves.\n\nTherefore, my move is UP.UP",

If the enemy misses it or dies, I can grab it.\n    -   Keeps me close to the enemy.\n    -   If Enemy 1 moves LEFT (to 8,5), we both die. If Enemy 1 moves UP (to 9,6), they eat the apple and grow.\n-   **DOWN (to 8,4):**\n    -   Moves me away from the enemy and the apple at (9,6).\n    -   Opens up the board below me.\n\n**Why UP is better:**\n1.  **Proximity to Food:** Even if I don't eat immediately, staying near the apple (8,6 is adjacent to 9,6) is good.\n2.  **Risk Assessment:** The enemy at (9,5) has limited options. They can go UP (eat apple), LEFT (hit me -> we both die), or RIGHT (off board -> die). DOWN is blocked by their tail? No, they have no body. But DOWN takes them to (9,4). Actually, they have no tail, so they can move in any direction that isn't a wall.\n    -   If they go LEFT (to 8,5), I die (I am there).\n    -   If I go UP (to 8,6), and they go LEFT (to 8,5), I am at 8,6 and they are at 8,5. I survive.\n    -   If I am at (8,5) and they move LEFT to (8,5), I die *this turn*.\n    -   Wait, the move happens simultaneously.\n    -   My move: LEFT (to 7,5) -> Death (Self).\n    -   My move: RIGHT (to 9,5) -> Death (Enemy).\n    -   My move: UP (to 8,6).\n    -   My move: DOWN (to 8,4).\n    \n    **Enemy Analysis:**\n    If I move UP to (8, 6):\n    -   Enemy at (9, 5).\n    -   If Enemy moves UP -> (9, 6). (Safe for them, they eat apple).\n    -   If Enemy moves LEFT -> (8, 5). (I am moving to 8,6, so 8,5 is empty. Safe for them? Yes. But wait, if I move UP, my old body (7,5) follows. My new body will be [(8,5), (7,5)]. So (8,5) will be occupied by my neck. If Enemy moves LEFT to (8,5), they hit my neck. They die. I live.\n    -   If Enemy moves DOWN -> (9, 4). (Safe).\n    -   If Enemy moves RIGHT -> (10, 5). Out of bounds. Death.\n\n    So, if I go UP:\n    -   Enemy going LEFT is suicide for them (hits my neck). They likely won't do that if they play optimally.\n    -   Enemy going UP eats the apple.\n    -   Enemy going DOWN survives.\n    \n    If I go DOWN:\n    -   I am at (8,4).\n    -   Enemy going LEFT hits (8,5). That space is empty (I left it). They survive.\n    -   Enemy going UP eats apple.\n    \n    **Why UP is strictly better than DOWN:**\n    -   If I go UP, I am at (8,6).\n    -   If I go DOWN, I am at (8,4).\n    -   The apple at (9,6) is valuable. Being at (8,6) puts me right next to it. If the enemy doesn't eat it (maybe they go down), I can get it next turn.\n    -   If I go DOWN, I am moving away from the only nearby apple.\n    -   If I go UP, I control the space (8,6). If the enemy tries to come to (8,5) or (8,6), they are at risk.\n    -   If I go DOWN, the enemy controls the upper space.\n\n    Furthermore, looking at the rest of the board, the cluster of apples is at y=5,4,2. (3,5), (2,4), (2,2), (3,4). These are to the left. Moving DOWN puts me at y=4, x=8. Moving UP puts me at y=6, x=8. To reach the cluster, I need to go LEFT. Going UP or DOWN doesn't change the distance to the cluster significantly in terms of turns (Manhattan distance from (8,4) vs (8,6) to (3,5) is roughly the same). However, (8,6) is closer to (9,6) which is an immediate opportunity.\n\n    **Critical Point:**\n    If I move UP, my body becomes [(8,5), (7,5)].\n    The enemy is at (9,5).\n    If the enemy moves LEFT to (8,5), they hit my neck (8,5) and die. This is a very strong defensive move for me. I effectively block the left approach.\n    \n    If I move DOWN, my body becomes [(8,5), (7,5)].\n    The enemy moves. If they move LEFT to (8,5), they hit my neck (8,5) and die.\n    So the blocking aspect is the same for both UP and DOWN (my neck remains at 8,5).\n    \n    So, the difference is purely based on positioning relative to apples.\n    -   UP gets me closer to (9,6).\n    -   DOWN gets me closer to (nothing immediate, but opens up the lower board).\n\n    I will choose UP.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**\nMove UP to (8,6). Prepare to either chase the (9,6) apple if the enemy doesn't take it, or navigate around the enemy to head left towards the main cluster. Watch out for enemy moving UP to (9,6), blocking my access to that apple or potentially turning back to hit me if I pursue.\n\nMove: UP\n\nFinal check:\nCoordinates: (8,5) -> UP -> (8,6).\nIs it on board? Yes (0-9).\nIs it my body? My body is (7,5). No.\nIs it enemy body? Enemy is (9,5). No.\nIs it backwards? Backwards is (7,5). No.\n\nResult: Safe.\n\nUP",

Length: 2.\n- **Board:** 10x10.\n- **Turn:** 4/150.\n- **Apples:** (3, 5), (2, 4), (2, 2), (3, 4), (7, 2).\n\n**Turn Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Eliminate immediately fatal moves:**\n    *   **LEFT:** Moves to (7, 6). My body is at (8, 5). My old tail will be at (8, 5) if I move. (7, 6) is empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Moves to (9, 6). Enemy Head is there. Both heads would collide -> Mutual Death. **Fatal.**\n    *   **UP:** Moves to (8, 7). Empty. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN:** Moves to (8, 5). My body is currently at (8, 5). Even if I move, the rule is \"moving into your own body kills you\". The body part is currently there. **Fatal.**\n\n    So, safe options are LEFT and UP.\n\n2.  **Compare LEFT and UP:**\n    *   **UP (to 8,7):** Moves away from the enemy, keeps x-coordinate at 8. Opens up the upper board.\n    *   **LEFT (to 7,6):** Moves closer to the enemy's side (relative to the x-axis), changes x to 7.\n        *   The apple at (7, 2) is directly below this move (at x=7). This aligns me with the x-coordinate of that apple.\n        *   The apples at (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5) are to the far left.\n\n    **Strategic Decision:**\n    Choosing **LEFT** puts my head at (7, 6). This coordinates me with the apple at (7, 2). It also moves me towards the general cluster of apples on the left side of the board. Moving LEFT also keeps me adjacent to the potential path of the enemy if they were to move LEFT, but I am one step removed from the immediate danger zone (the 9-column).\n\n    If I move LEFT to (7, 6):\n    *   My body becomes [(8, 5)] (the old head).\n    *   I am at (7, 6).\n    *   I am safe from the enemy at (9, 6).\n    *   I am 4 units away from the apple at (7, 2).\n    *   I am \"heading towards\" the main apple cluster.\n\n    If I move UP to (8, 7):\n    *   I am moving away from the primary apple cluster (which is mostly y <= 5 and x <= 3).\n    *   While safer in the short term from the specific enemy position, it delays reaching the food.\n\n    Since the goal is to collect apples and I see a clear path to the left side of the board where multiple apples are located, moving LEFT is the optimal play to position myself for future turns.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**\nMove LEFT to (7, 6). From there, I can descend towards the apple at (7, 2) or continue navigating left towards the cluster at (2, 2) - (3, 5). I will monitor the enemy's movement. If they move LEFT to (8, 6), they will be adjacent to my old body (8, 5) and my new position (7, 6), creating a potential standoff, but I will maintain the initiative towards the food.\n\nLEFT",
