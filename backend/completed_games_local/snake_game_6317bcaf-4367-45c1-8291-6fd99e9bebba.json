Closest apple is (0,3) or (5,1).  \n(5,1) is 2 right, 1 up from (3,0) \u2192 maybe RIGHT then UP or UP then RIGHT.  \nBut (0,3) is 3 left, 3 up \u2192 longer.  \nEnemy might go UP to (3,1) first step toward (5,1).  \n\nNo risk of head-on collision with me this turn because I\u2019m at (6,4), far away.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 My nearest apples:**  \nFrom (6,4):  \n- (5,1) \u2192 distance |6-5|+|4-1|=1+3=4  \n- (0,5) \u2192 6+1=7  \n- (0,3) \u2192 6+1=7  \n- (9,0) \u2192 3+4=7  \n- (9,1) \u2192 3+3=6  \n\nClosest is (5,1).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Move toward (5,1):**  \n(5,1) is at x=5, y=1.

But going DOWN first keeps me more central, avoids moving toward left edge too early.  \n\nAlso, enemy is at (3,0) heading toward (5,1) possibly. If I go LEFT then DOWN, I might meet enemy near apple in a few turns. Safer to approach from above?  \n\nActually, apple at (5,1): enemy could be there in 2 turns (UP to (3,1), RIGHT to (4,1), RIGHT to (5,1)).  \nI could be there in 3 turns (DOWN to (6,3), LEFT to (5,3), DOWN to (5,2), DOWN to (5,1)). So enemy gets there first.  \n\nMaybe better to target another apple to avoid conflict while small.  \n\nApple at (0,5) is far but less contested. Apple at (9,0) and (9,1) are near bottom right, enemy far from them.  \n\nBut (9,0) and (9,1) are close to each other, maybe I can go right/down to get them.  \n\nFrom (6,4):  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7,4) then down toward (9,1) etc.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility:**  \nFrom (6,4):  \n- UP (6,5): then can go UP/RIGHT/LEFT.  \n- DOWN (6,3): then can go DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT.  \n- LEFT (5,4): then can go LEFT/UP/DOWN.  \n- RIGHT (7,4): then can go RIGHT/UP/DOWN.  \n\nAll keep 3 options next turn except if near edge later.  \n\nGiven enemy is bottom left, maybe go toward right side apples to avoid early fight.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nI\u2019ll go RIGHT to (7,4) to start heading toward apples (9,1) and (9,0), which enemy is far from.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove toward (9,1) via right/down moves, staying flexible.

Wait, after growth, body will be [(9, 1), (9, 2)], so head at (9, 0), body at (9, 1) and (9, 2). So UP to (9, 1) is body \u2192 invalid. LEFT (8, 0) \u2013 empty. DOWN off board \u2192 invalid. So only LEFT is safe next turn if I go DOWN now. That\u2019s risky \u2014 could trap me if enemy blocks (8, 0) area later, but next turn only one safe move isn\u2019t necessarily fatal if planned.  \n\nLEFT to (8, 1):  \n- No apple.  \n- Next turn from (8, 1): possible moves: UP (8, 2) \u2013 empty, DOWN (8, 0) \u2013 empty, LEFT (7, 1) \u2013 empty, RIGHT (9, 1) \u2013 my body (since tail at (9, 2) moves? Actually after moving LEFT without eating, my body moves: head to (8, 1), tail disappears from (9, 2), body becomes [(9, 1)]? Wait, careful: current body is [(9, 2)], head at (9, 1). If I move LEFT to (8, 1) without eating, snake moves: head to (8, 1), old head (9, 1) becomes body segment, old tail (9, 2) disappears. So new body: [(9, 1)]. So next turn from (8, 1), RIGHT to (9, 1) is my body \u2192 invalid. So safe moves from (8, 1) would be UP, DOWN, LEFT \u2014 three options, better mobility.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Growth vs mobility trade-off**  \nEating apple now gives me score 2 vs enemy\u2019s 1, but reduces next turn\u2019s safe moves to 1 (only LEFT from (9, 0)). That\u2019s dangerous if enemy moves toward me.  \nGoing LEFT now keeps mobility high, lets me approach apple (5, 1) or (0, 3) later, and avoids corner trap.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s likely move**  \nEnemy might go UP toward apple (5, 6) or LEFT/DOWN toward (5, 1). (5, 1) is closer to me \u2014 if enemy goes DOWN twice, it could reach (5, 1) before me if I delay. But (5, 1) is 4 left from me, enemy is 4 left and 3 up from it, so distance for enemy to (5, 1) is 3 steps (DOWN thrice), for me 4 steps (LEFT 4). So enemy could get there first if it heads straight down.  \n\nGiven that, maybe better to eat (9, 0) now to grow and deny it later? But eating (9, 0) traps me in corner with one exit next turn.  \n\nActually, check: after eating (9, 0), my body will be: head (9, 0), body segments at (9, 1) and (9, 2). So from (9, 0), only LEFT (8, 0) is safe. That\u2019s risky but not instantly fatal if (8, 0) is safe next turn.  \n\nBut if enemy moves toward (5, 1), it\u2019s still far from (8, 0) next turn.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nI think short-term growth is good, and (9, 0) apple will be gone if I don\u2019t take it now. Taking it gives me score lead. I can survive next turn by going LEFT from (9, 0) to (8, 0), then reassess.  \n\nSo I\u2019ll take the apple.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating (9, 0), go LEFT to (8, 0) next turn unless something dangerous appears. Then from (8, 0) I\u2019ll have more options (UP, LEFT). Keep moving toward center to avoid corner traps. Watch enemy movement toward (5, 1) or (5, 6).  \n\nDOWN",

No immediate collision risk this turn unless we both choose same cell.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nClosest apple is (5, 1) at distance |7-5| + |1-1| = 2.  \nFrom (7,1):  \n- LEFT to (6,1) gets to distance 1 from apple.  \n- UP to (7,2) increases distance to 3.  \n- RIGHT to (8,1) increases distance to 3.  \n\nLEFT is best for reaching (5,1) next turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility**  \nFrom (6,1): next turn possible moves:  \nUP (6,2) \u2013 empty  \nDOWN (6,0) \u2013 my body? Wait, my body currently is at (7,0),(8,0),(9,0). (6,0) is empty now.  \nLEFT (5,1) \u2013 apple  \nRIGHT (7,1) \u2013 empty but where my head is now, will be empty after I move.  \n\nSo from (6,1) next turn I\u2019d have 3 safe moves. Good.  \n\nFrom (7,2): next turn possible moves:  \nUP (7,3) \u2013 empty  \nDOWN (7,1) \u2013 empty after move  \nLEFT (6,2) \u2013 empty  \nRIGHT (8,2) \u2013 empty  \nAll 4 might be safe, but further from apple.  \n\nFrom (8,1): next turn possible moves:  \nUP (8,2) \u2013 empty  \nDOWN (8,0) \u2013 my body (8,0) currently, but after this turn my body moves? Wait, after I move, my tail moves only if I eat an apple. I haven\u2019t eaten apple this turn, so my tail stays at (9,0) and body shifts: new body will be [(new head), (7,1), (7,0), (8,0)]? Let\u2019s check:  \nIf I move LEFT to (6,1), my body becomes [(6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (8,0)] \u2014 tail (9,0) disappears because no growth. So (8,0) is part of body next turn.  \nThus from (8,1) next turn, DOWN to (8,0) would be invalid (my body). So from (8,1) safe moves: UP, LEFT(7,1), RIGHT(9,1) \u2014 3 moves.  \n\nSo all three safe moves give similar future mobility.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid enemy collision**  \nEnemy at (4,5) could go DOWN to (4,4), LEFT to (3,5), RIGHT to (5,5). None conflict with my possible moves this turn.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nGoal: get (5,1) apple while staying safe.  \nIf I go LEFT to (6,1) now, next turn I can go LEFT to (5,1) and eat apple.  \nCheck safety: after eating apple at (5,1), I grow to length 5, tail stays at (8,0)? Actually after eating, tail doesn\u2019t move, so new body: [(5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (8,0)].  \n\nBut need to check if enemy could reach (5,1) same turn as me:  \nEnemy at (4,5) to (5,1) is distance |4-5|+|5-1|=1+4=5 steps away. They can\u2019t reach it in 1 turn. So safe.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nLEFT gets me closest to apple, maintains good mobility, no immediate danger.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go LEFT to (6,1) now, next turn go LEFT to (5,1) to eat apple unless enemy suddenly moves into that cell (unlikely). Then after eating, consider moving DOWN/UP to avoid trapping myself.  \n\nLEFT",

But this turn we move simultaneously: I move to (0, 1), enemy moves to (0, 2) or (0, 4). If enemy goes to (0, 2), next turn I must avoid (0, 1) if enemy goes DOWN into it.  \n\nActually, if enemy goes DOWN to (0, 2) this turn, then next turn enemy could go DOWN to (0, 1) or LEFT off board (invalid) or RIGHT (1, 2) or UP back to (0, 3). So if I\u2019m at (0, 1) next turn, enemy could move into (0, 1) and kill us both. That\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (1, 0), enemy at (0, 2) is not adjacent next turn (Manhattan distance 3). Safer.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Apple safety**  \nApple at (0, 0) is reachable in 2 moves from (1, 1) via DOWN then LEFT, or LEFT then DOWN.  \nBut LEFT then DOWN puts me at (0, 1) with enemy possibly at (0, 2) \u2192 risk.  \nDOWN then LEFT puts me at (1, 0) then (0, 0) with enemy at (0, 2) or (0, 4) \u2192 safer.  \n\nAlso, enemy might go for (0, 5) apple if it moves UP, but that\u2019s away from (0, 0).  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN to (1, 0) seems safest:  \n- Gets me closer to (0, 0) apple.  \n- Avoids adjacency risk with enemy next turn.  \n- Keeps 2 safe moves next turn (LEFT to apple, RIGHT to open space).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 0), if apple at (0, 0) still there, take it with LEFT unless enemy is threatening (0, 1). If enemy at (0, 2), be careful moving to (0, 0) because enemy could go to (0, 1) next turn. Might go RIGHT to (2, 0) for safety if needed.  \n\nDOWN",

Actually, eating apple means next turn my body will be length 6: head at (0, 0), then old head (1, 0) becomes segment 2, then (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1).  \nFrom (0, 0) next turn:  \nUP (0, 1): empty.  \nDOWN off board \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT off board \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT (1, 0): will be my body segment 2 next turn \u2192 invalid.  \nSo only 1 safe move next turn (UP). That\u2019s risky \u2014 could trap me.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 0):  \nFrom (2, 0) next turn:  \nUP (2, 1): my body (segment 3 currently, but after move: body will be (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) \u2014 yes (2,1) is my body) \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN (2, -1) off board \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT (1, 0): my body (segment 2) \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT (3, 0): empty.  \nSo only 1 safe move next turn (RIGHT). Also risky.  \n\nBoth moves leave me with 1 safe move next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy threat**  \nIf enemy goes UP to (0, 5), it eats apple, grows, and will be at (0, 5) next turn, far from me.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (1, 4), it\u2019s at (1, 4), still far.  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk this turn because enemy can\u2019t reach my possible destinations (0,0) or (2,0) from (0,4) in one move.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Compare LEFT vs RIGHT**  \nLEFT: eat apple, grow to length 6, but next turn only UP (0,1) is safe. From (0,1) the turn after, options might open up if enemy isn\u2019t blocking.  \nRIGHT: no apple, stay length 5, next turn only RIGHT (3,0) safe. From (3,0) the turn after, maybe more options.  \n\nEating apple now puts me at 5 apples vs enemy\u2019s 6 (if enemy eats (0,5) this turn, enemy will have 7). Catching up in score is good, but being trapped next turn is dangerous.  \n\nHowever, if I go RIGHT, I stay shorter and still have only 1 safe move next turn \u2014 same trap risk.  \n\nMaybe LEFT is better because:  \n- Eating apple gives growth, which might help in future collisions.  \n- From (0,0) next turn, UP to (0,1) is safe. Enemy at (0,5) or (1,4) won\u2019t threaten (0,1) immediately next turn. Then from (0,1) I could go to (0,2) or (1,1) depending on body.  \n\nActually, check body after LEFT + apple:  \nTurn 17: head to (0,0), eat apple \u2192 new body: head (0,0), then (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1).  \nTurn 18: from (0,0) only UP to (0,1) safe.  \nTurn 18 body after moving UP without eating apple: head (0,1), then (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), tail (4,1) gone? Wait, no \u2014 if no apple eaten on turn 18, tail (old tail (4,1)) disappears, so length stays 6: head (0,1), then (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1).  \nFrom (0,1) turn 19: possible moves? UP (0,2) empty, DOWN (0,0) my body, LEFT off board, RIGHT (1,1) my body. So again only 1 safe move (UP). That\u2019s a corridor \u2014 dangerous.  \n\nSo LEFT leads to a vertical corridor at x=0 with only UP moves possible for at least 2 turns \u2014 very trap-prone.  \n\nRIGHT: from (2,0) next turn only RIGHT to (3,0). From (3,0) turn after: check possible moves then: body will be (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) if no apple. From (3,0): UP (3,1) body, DOWN off, LEFT (2,0) body, RIGHT (4,0) empty. So again only 1 safe move (RIGHT). That\u2019s also a corridor along bottom edge.  \n\nBoth are corridors. Which is safer?  \n\nLEFT corridor has enemy possibly above at y=4 or 5, not an immediate threat.  \nRIGHT corridor has enemy at y=3 or 4, not immediately threatening bottom row.  \n\nBut apple at (0,0) will be gone if I don\u2019t take it now. Taking it gives me score gain.  \n\nGiven the trap risk either way, maybe I should choose the move that gets the apple to keep pace in score, and hope to escape corridor later by enemy moving away.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nI\u2019ll take the apple.  \n\nLEFT",

Length stays 6.  \n\nFrom (0, 1) next turn:  \nUP (0, 2): empty.  \nDOWN (0, 0): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT off board \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT (1, 1): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo again only UP will be safe next turn.  \n\nThis means I\u2019m in a vertical corridor along x=0, moving upward with no immediate branching options.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI need to escape this corridor. The only way is to reach a row where I can move RIGHT safely without hitting my own body.  \nMy body occupies (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1).  \nIf I keep moving UP along x=0, eventually my tail will move forward as I progress, freeing up (1,1) etc.  \n\nCheck when (1,1) becomes free:  \nCurrent body order: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1).  \nAfter moving UP to (0,1): body becomes (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1).  \nAfter moving UP again to (0,2): body becomes (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1).  \nAt that point, (1,1) is still occupied.  \nAfter moving UP again to (0,3): body becomes (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (1,1).  \nStill (1,1) occupied.  \nAfter moving UP to (0,4): body becomes (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0). Now (1,1) is free.  \n\nSo after 4 moves UP, (1,1) is free, meaning from (0,4) I could move RIGHT to (1,4) if it\u2019s empty.  \n\nBut enemy is currently at (0,5) and may move around. I must avoid running into enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples: (3,4) is 7 moves away (Manhattan distance from (0,0)), (4,7), (2,8), (9,4), (9,8).  \nNone are reachable soon given my constrained path.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Danger from enemy:**  \nEnemy at (0,5) could move UP to (0,6) or RIGHT to (1,5).  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (1,5), it might later block my future exit at (1,4).  \nIf enemy goes UP to (0,6), it stays above me in my corridor \u2014 risk of meeting head-on if I keep going up.  \n\nI should monitor enemy\u2019s position each turn. For now, only UP is safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nOnly one legal move: UP.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nKeep moving UP along left wall until my tail advances enough to free (1,1).  \nWatch enemy\u2019s position \u2014 if enemy stays at y=5 or above, I may need to stop before (0,5) to avoid head-on risk.  \nOnce (1,1) is free, consider moving RIGHT to escape corridor if safe.  \nAvoid moving into enemy\u2019s possible path.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

Enemy\u2019s tail is at (3,3), so (1,3) is not tail yet. Actually enemy\u2019s body: [(1,5),(0,5),(0,4),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3),(3,3)] \u2014 (1,3) is in middle, so after enemy moves, that segment shifts; (1,3) will be occupied by enemy\u2019s body segment from (0,3) if enemy moves? Let\u2019s check: enemy\u2019s current body: head (2,5), then (1,5),(0,5),(0,4),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3),(3,3). If enemy moves UP/DOWN/RIGHT, the segment at (0,3) stays, so (1,3) stays occupied by enemy\u2019s body. So (1,3) will be enemy body next turn. So RIGHT from (0,3) next turn is blocked.  \nThus after UP, next turn only UP is safe \u2014 trapped on left wall with only one move.\n\n**Option B: RIGHT to (1, 2)**  \nNext turn body: head (1, 2), then (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1) \u2014 tail (2,1) disappears.  \nFrom (1, 2) next turn:  \nUP (1, 3): enemy body currently at (1,3), after enemy moves, (1,3) will be enemy body (as above) \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN (1, 1): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT (0, 2): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT (2, 2): empty now, and enemy at (2,5) could move to (2,4) or (2,6) or (3,5), not (2,2). So (2,2) safe next turn.  \nSo after RIGHT, next turn only RIGHT is safe \u2014 but that gets me into open board at (2,2) with more options afterward.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple access:**  \nClosest apple to (0,2) is (3,4) \u2014 3 steps away.  \nFrom (1,2) it\u2019s 2 steps in x and 2 in y to (3,4).  \nFrom (0,3) it\u2019s 3 steps in x and 1 in y to (3,4).  \nBoth similar, but (1,2) gives better future mobility.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy threat path:**  \nEnemy at (2,5) could go DOWN to (2,4), then next turn to (2,3) or (1,4) etc. That could block my path to (3,4) if I delay.  \nBut I need to survive first \u2014 being stuck on left wall with only UP each turn is dangerous.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP leads to being trapped next turn (only UP again).  \nRIGHT leads to (1,2) with only RIGHT next turn, but then into open board.  \nRIGHT seems better for escaping the left edge.\n\nCheck immediate safety once more:  \n(1,2) is empty now and no enemy can reach it this turn.  \nSo RIGHT is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (1,2), next turn go RIGHT to (2,2) to enter open area.  \nFrom (2,2), consider moving toward apple at (3,4) via (3,2) then (3,3) then (3,4), but check enemy\u2019s position \u2014 enemy may be near (2,4) or (3,5) by then.  \nAvoid head-on with longer enemy.  \nIf blocked, maybe go for (4,7) via upward path.\n\nRIGHT",

So no immediate head-on risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future mobility after RIGHT to (2, 2):**  \nNext turn body: head (2, 2), then (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0) \u2014 tail (1, 1) disappears.  \n\nFrom (2, 2) next turn:  \nUP (2, 3): enemy body currently at (2, 3) \u2192 will still be enemy body next turn (enemy\u2019s body shifts but (2,3) remains occupied because enemy\u2019s current body: (2,5),(1,5),(0,5),(0,4),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3) \u2014 after enemy moves, the segment at (1,3) moves to (2,3)? Wait, let\u2019s simulate: enemy\u2019s body length 8, so if enemy moves, tail (2,3) disappears, but the segment before tail (1,3) moves to (2,3) if enemy moves right? Actually, enemy\u2019s body order: head (3,5), then (2,5), (1,5), (0,5), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3). After enemy moves, the segment at (1,3) becomes (2,3) only if enemy moves in a way that shifts body along that path. But regardless, (2,3) is currently enemy body and will likely remain enemy body next turn because the segment at (1,3) moves to (2,3) if enemy moves DOWN/UP/RIGHT? Let\u2019s check: if enemy moves DOWN to (3,4), new head (3,4), then body: (3,5),(2,5),(1,5),(0,5),(0,4),(0,3),(1,3) \u2014 tail (2,3) is gone, so (2,3) becomes free? Yes, because tail was (2,3) and it disappears. So (2,3) could be free next turn if enemy moves DOWN (eats apple at (3,4)) or moves elsewhere? Wait, apple at (3,4) \u2014 if enemy moves DOWN to (3,4), it eats apple, grows to length 9, so tail stays at (2,3)? Actually, growth means tail doesn\u2019t disappear, so (2,3) remains occupied. So (2,3) stays enemy body. So UP from (2,2) next turn likely blocked.  \n\nDOWN (2, 1): empty now and likely safe next turn.  \nLEFT (1, 2): my body next turn \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT (3, 2): empty now, likely safe next turn.  \n\nSo from (2,2) next turn, safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT. That\u2019s better than being trapped.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple access:**  \nClosest apple is (3, 4) \u2014 from (2,2) it\u2019s 2 steps away in Manhattan distance if we go (3,2) then (3,3) then (3,4), but (3,3) is currently empty, but enemy at (3,5) could move to (3,4) or (3,6) or (4,5). If enemy moves DOWN to (3,4) this turn, it will eat apple and be at (3,4) next turn, blocking (3,4) for me. So maybe not worth targeting (3,4) now.  \n\nOther apples: (4,7) is farther but reachable via (3,2) \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 (4,3) etc.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy longer than me, so avoid head-on. After my RIGHT to (2,2), enemy could move DOWN to (3,4) (eat apple) or UP to (3,6). Either way, enemy will be close to (3,4) apple if it hasn\u2019t eaten it.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nOnly one safe move: RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (2,2), next turn consider DOWN to (2,1) or RIGHT to (3,2) depending on enemy position.  \nGoal: avoid getting trapped, aim for apple (4,7) or (2,8) by moving up the right side.  \nKeep distance from enemy head.  \n\nRIGHT",

If enemy moves UP to (4, 6) this turn, then (4, 5) becomes body next turn, blocking my vertical path.  \n\nEnemy is longer (length 10 vs my 6), so I should avoid confrontation.  \nGoing RIGHT to (4, 1) puts me directly below enemy\u2019s possible positions, but not adjacent now.  \n\nIf enemy goes UP to (4, 6), then next turn enemy head at (4, 6), body at (4, 5), (4, 4), etc.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (5, 5), then next turn enemy head at (5, 5), body at (4, 5), (4, 4), etc.  \n\nEither way, (4, 2) and (4, 3) are empty next turn if I go RIGHT now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nRIGHT now gives best mobility. From (4, 1) next turn, I can go UP toward apples if safe, or move horizontally to avoid enemy. The enemy is far enough above that immediate danger is low.  \n\nLEFT and DOWN both reduce future moves to 2, risking getting trapped soon.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Final choice:**  \nRIGHT maximizes future options and keeps me safe this turn.  \n\nRIGHT",

Avoid moving toward column 3\u20134 where enemy is. UP is safe but doesn\u2019t progress toward apples as directly as RIGHT does.  \n\nRIGHT also keeps 3 safe moves next turn and moves toward the rightmost apples while staying low to avoid enemy\u2019s area.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Final choice:**  \nRIGHT maximizes distance from enemy and moves toward apples while keeping good mobility.  \n\nRIGHT",

Wait, check: Body: [(2, 8), (3, 8), ...] Yes, (2, 8) is its body segment \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT \u2192 (1, 9): apple there, empty otherwise.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3, 9): empty.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s possible moves: LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nMy possible moves:  \nUP to (8, 3), LEFT to (7, 2), RIGHT to (9, 2).  \nNo overlap with enemy\u2019s possible head positions (1, 9) or (3, 9).  \nNo immediate head-on risk.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future mobility from each safe move:**  \n\n**Option UP to (8, 3):**  \nNext turn body: head (8, 3), then (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1) \u2014 tail (4, 1) disappears.  \nFrom (8, 3) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (8, 4): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (8, 2): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT \u2192 (7, 3): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9, 3): empty.  \n3 safe moves next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).

But it\u2019s long, so avoid moving into areas it might go.  \nUP moves me toward center/open area, keeps options.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy has 11 apples, I have 5. Need to catch up but safely.  \nUP keeps mobility high, avoids edges, and positions to go for (9, 4) in a couple of turns.  \nLEFT and RIGHT reduce future options.  \n\nBest choice: UP.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 3), consider moving toward (9, 4) via RIGHT then UP, but always check enemy movement first.

Good.\n\n**Option LEFT to (7, 4):**  \nNext turn body: head (7, 4), then (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1).  \nFrom (7, 4) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (7, 5): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (7, 3): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (6, 4): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (8, 4): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Good.\n\n**Option RIGHT to (9, 4):**  \nEats apple \u2192 length becomes 7, body grows by 1, so tail stays at (6, 1).  \nNext turn body: head (9, 4), then (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1).  \nFrom (9, 4) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (9, 5): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (9, 3): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (8, 4): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \nOnly 2 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN). Less flexible, and I'm in corner.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity and risk:**  \nRIGHT to (9, 4) gets apple immediately, but traps me in top-right corner with only 2 moves next turn. That\u2019s risky if enemy approaches later.  \nUP or LEFT keep flexibility.  \nUP moves toward apples at (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9) but not immediately into corner.  \nLEFT moves toward center and apple at (7, 0) eventually.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is far away now, but it's long and could block paths. I need to catch up in apples safely.  \nTaking RIGHT now is tempting for quick apple, but cornering myself with long body reduces escape routes. Better to stay flexible.  \nUP gives good options next turn: from (8, 5) I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP to approach apples while keeping space.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 5), assess safety of moving toward (9, 7) cluster. If enemy is far, maybe go RIGHT to (9, 5) then UP to (9, 6) toward apples. Avoid getting pinned in corner. Keep distance from enemy\u2019s long body.\n\nUP",

From (7, 6), next turn I can go UP to (7, 7) (empty), then right toward apples.  \n\nActually, RIGHT now seems slightly better for apple proximity while keeping mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 6), check if UP (7, 7) is safe (likely yes unless enemy moves there, unlikely). Then from (7, 7) I can go RIGHT toward apples.  \n\nRIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

That\u2019s risky.  \n\nUP to (8, 7) keeps me one step from (9, 7) apple, but also leaves me more space to maneuver \u2014 I can go LEFT to (7, 7) or UP to (8, 8) next turn before deciding to grab apple.  \n\nDOWN to (8, 5) moves away from the top-right apple cluster but toward (9, 4) apple eventually.\n\nGiven enemy has 12 apples and I have 5, I need to collect apples faster but safely. The top-right cluster is tempting but dangerous if I get trapped.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nIf I go UP to (8, 7), next turn I can consider:  \n- LEFT to (7, 7) to stay flexible,  \n- or go RIGHT to (9, 7) to eat apple if path clear and escape route exists (check enemy position then).  \nAvoid going RIGHT now into (9, 6) because it reduces next-turn options to 2.  \n\nUP seems best balance: keeps apple in reach, maintains flexibility, avoids immediate dead-end.\n\n---\n\nUP",

(empty).  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 4): board shows '.' (empty).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 5): board shows '.' (empty).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 5): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy possible moves and head-on collisions**  \nEnemy head: (8, 9)  \nEnemy body: [(9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4)]  \n\nFrom (8, 9), enemy moves:  \n- UP \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 8): board shows '.' (empty).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 9): board shows '.' (empty).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 9): its own body \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo enemy can go to (8, 8) or (7, 9).  \n\nMy safe moves: UP (3, 6), DOWN (3, 4), LEFT (2, 5). None match (8, 8) or (7, 9), so no head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future mobility from each safe move**  \n\n**UP to (3, 6):**  \nNext turn body: head (3, 6), then (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7) \u2014 tail (6, 7) disappears.  \nFrom (3, 6):  \nUP \u2192 (3, 7): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (3, 5): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT \u2192 (2, 6): apple at (2, 6) \u2014 safe to eat.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4, 6): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) if apple counts as safe (it is).  \n\n**DOWN to (3, 4):**  \nNext turn body: head (3, 4), then (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7) \u2014 tail (6, 7) disappears.  \nFrom (3, 4):  \nUP \u2192 (3, 5): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN \u2192 (3, 3): enemy body at (3, 3) \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT \u2192 (2, 4): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4, 4): empty.  \nSo 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n**LEFT to (2, 5):**  \nNext turn body: head (2, 5), then (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7) \u2014 tail (6, 7) disappears.  \nFrom (2, 5):  \nUP \u2192 (2, 6): apple at (2, 6) \u2014 safe to eat.  \nDOWN \u2192 (2, 4): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (1, 5): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3, 5): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n\nUP and LEFT both give 3 safe moves next turn, DOWN gives 2.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (7, 0), (5, 0), (8, 6), (2, 6), (1, 2)  \n\nClosest apple is (2, 6) at distance |3-2| + |5-6| = 2.  \n- UP now \u2192 (3, 6), then LEFT next turn \u2192 (2, 6) eats it.  \n- LEFT now \u2192 (2, 5), then UP next turn \u2192 (2, 6) eats it.  \n\nBoth get apple in 2 moves.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy movement and territory**  \nEnemy is long and controls right side and bottom middle. My left side is safer. Moving UP to (3, 6) is slightly more central but still safe from enemy head this turn. Moving LEFT to (2, 5) is farther from enemy.  \n\nBut (2, 6) apple is valuable, and both UP and LEFT get me there. However, if I go UP now to (3, 6), I have more options next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) than if I go LEFT now (UP, DOWN, LEFT). UP now keeps more escape routes open after eating apple next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nEnemy has 16 apples, I have 5. Need to eat apples quickly but safely. Target (2, 6) next turn, then consider (1, 2) after. Avoid moving toward enemy body cluster at bottom middle.  \n\nUP now gives best flexibility while still heading toward apple.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter UP to (3, 6), eat (2, 6) next turn unless enemy threatens that cell (unlikely now). Then move toward (1, 2) via DOWN/LEFT. Keep away from enemy\u2019s possible expansion.  \n\nUP",

Wait, let\u2019s simulate:  \n  If I go DOWN now, next turn LEFT to (0, 0) apple \u2192 grow, new tail stays at old tail (2, 6)? Actually growth means tail doesn\u2019t move that turn, so new body: head (0, 0), then (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6) \u2014 length 10.  \n  From (0, 0) after eating apple:  \n  UP \u2192 (0, 1): my body (since (1, 1) is in body but (0, 1) is free? Wait, (0, 1) is not in body yet \u2014 check: body after growth: (0, 0) head, then (1, 0), (1, 1), \u2026 so (0, 1) is free. So UP is safe.  \n  DOWN \u2192 off board.  \n  LEFT \u2192 off board.  \n  RIGHT \u2192 (1, 0): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n  So only UP is safe after eating at (0, 0) if I go DOWN now then LEFT. That\u2019s risky \u2014 only 1 exit.  \n\n- LEFT now to (0, 1): next turn DOWN to (0, 0) apple \u2192 grow, new body: head (0, 0), then (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), \u2026, (2, 6), (3, 6) length 10.  \n  From (0, 0) after eating:  \n  UP \u2192 (0, 1): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n  DOWN \u2192 off board.  \n  LEFT \u2192 off board.  \n  RIGHT \u2192 (1, 0): empty (since (1, 0) not in body).  \n  So only RIGHT is safe after eating at (0, 0) if I go LEFT now then DOWN. Also only 1 exit.  \n\nBoth paths to (0, 0) lead to a corner with 1 exit after eating. That\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nMaybe better to avoid (0, 0) for now and aim for bottom row apples (5, 0) or (7, 0) with more space.  \n\nRIGHT now to (2, 1) gives 3 exits next turn and moves toward center, away from tight corner. I can then go DOWN to (2, 0) and move toward (5, 0) or (7, 0) with more options.  \n\nGiven enemy\u2019s lead, I must avoid getting trapped. RIGHT seems best for keeping mobility.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nGo RIGHT to (2, 1), then likely DOWN to (2, 0), then LEFT toward (5, 0) or RIGHT toward (7, 0), watching enemy. Avoid going up into my long body.  \n\nRIGHT",

But RIGHT now keeps me off the bottom edge for one more turn, which might be safer in case enemy moves unpredictably.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nRIGHT keeps flexibility and sets up apple grab next turn.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nGo RIGHT to (5, 1), then DOWN to (5, 0) to eat apple. After eating, likely go LEFT to (4, 0) or RIGHT to (6, 0) depending on safety. Avoid moving toward enemy\u2019s territory top right.\n\nRIGHT",

If enemy goes RIGHT from (6, 3), they will be at (7, 3) this turn, so moving UP next turn to (7, 3) would be head-on collision if enemy stays there (but enemy moves each turn). However, if enemy eats apple at (7, 3) this turn, they will grow and stay at (7, 3) next turn? Wait: they move simultaneously, so if enemy moves to (7, 3) this turn, they eat apple and grow, so next turn their head is at (7, 3) and body extends backward. Then (7, 3) is occupied by enemy head next turn, so I can\u2019t move there. So UP now to (7, 2) risks losing the apple to enemy, but also avoids collision if enemy is there next turn.  \nDOWN \u2192 (7, 1): my body next turn \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT \u2192 (6, 2): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (8, 2): empty.  \nSo next turn from (7, 2), safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT (2 moves) if enemy at (7, 3), or UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 moves) if enemy not at (7, 3).  \n\n**LEFT to (6, 1)** \u2014 no apple:  \nNew body: head (6, 1), then (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1) \u2014 tail (1, 2) disappears.  \nFrom (6, 1):  \nUP \u2192 (6, 2): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (6, 0): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT \u2192 (5, 1): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7, 1): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo only 1 safe move next turn (UP). That\u2019s risky \u2014 avoid.  \n\n**RIGHT to (8, 1)** \u2014 no apple:  \nNew body: head (8, 1), then (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1) \u2014 tail (1, 2) disappears.  \nFrom (8, 1):  \nUP \u2192 (8, 2): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (8, 0): apple (A) \u2014 but (8, 0) is apple now, but after this turn, if enemy or I don\u2019t eat it, still apple. However, DOWN from (8, 1) next turn: (8, 0) currently apple, but after this turn, if not eaten, still apple. But my body at (7, 0) and (6, 0) etc. \u2014 wait, after moving to (8, 1), my body next turn: head (8, 1), then (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), ... So (8, 0) is free (apple). So DOWN is valid next turn.  \nLEFT \u2192 (7, 1): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9, 1): apple (A) \u2014 valid.  \nSo next turn from (8, 1), safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 moves). That\u2019s good.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Compare UP vs RIGHT**  \nUP (7, 2): possibly 2 or 3 safe moves next turn, closer to apple (7, 3) but enemy might take it this turn.  \nRIGHT (8, 1): 3 safe moves next turn, close to apples (8, 0) and (9, 1).  \nLEFT (6, 1) \u2192 only 1 safe move next turn \u2192 eliminate.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy threat to apples**  \nEnemy at (6, 3) can go RIGHT to (7, 3) apple this turn. If they do, they grow and occupy (7, 3) next turn, blocking me from going there.  \nIf I go UP to (7, 2), I can\u2019t get (7, 3) if enemy takes it.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 1), I can go DOWN next turn to (8, 0) apple or RIGHT to (9, 1) apple, both away from enemy.  \n\nEnemy is long (length 19), might avoid going into my smaller snake unless head-on.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nRIGHT gives better mobility next turn (3 options) and access to two apples soon.  \nUP risks fewer options if enemy takes (7, 3).  \nI\u2019ll go RIGHT to (8, 1) to improve position near apples and keep mobility.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (8, 1), consider DOWN to (8, 0) apple or RIGHT to (9, 1) apple, depending on enemy position. Avoid moving toward enemy\u2019s long body in center.  \n\nRIGHT",

From (9, 2), I can later go LEFT into board center if safe.  \nUP to (8, 2) keeps me more central but with fewer safe moves if enemy moves toward me.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN is too trapping.  \nUP is safe this turn but may lead to fewer options next turn.  \nRIGHT gives an apple now and at least two options next turn, and enemy is not immediately threatening (9, 1) this turn.  \n\nI\u2019ll go RIGHT to eat apple and stay alive with some options.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (9, 1), go UP to (9, 2) next turn to avoid dead-end at (9, 0) unless DOWN offers better escape later. Keep moving along right edge upward to eventually circle back left through top-right area if enemy body permits.  \n\nRIGHT",

(empty).  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (9, 0): board shows '.' (empty).  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (8, 1): my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy possible moves and head-on collision risk**  \nEnemy head: (8, 3)  \nEnemy body: [(7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (8, 9), (9, 9)]  \n\nFrom (8, 3), enemy moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (8, 4): board '.' (empty).  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 2): board '.' (empty).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 3): its body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 3): board '.' (empty).  \n\nSo enemy can go to (8, 4), (8, 2), (9, 3).  \n\nMy safe move destinations: (9, 2), (9, 0).  \nNo overlap with enemy\u2019s possible head positions \u2192 no immediate head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApple at (8, 0) is two steps away (LEFT then DOWN from head), but I can\u2019t go LEFT now.  \nApple at (1, 8) is far.  \nApple at (2, 5) is far.  \nApple at (0, 6) and (0, 0) are far.  \nNo apple adjacent this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move**  \n\n**UP to (9, 2)** \u2014 no apple:  \nNew body: head (9, 2), then (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1) \u2014 tail (1, 1) disappears.  \nFrom (9, 2):  \nUP \u2192 (9, 3): empty, but enemy could be there if enemy moved RIGHT from (8, 3) this turn. If enemy goes to (9, 3) this turn, next turn (9, 3) is enemy head \u2192 collision if I go UP.  \nDOWN \u2192 (9, 1): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT \u2192 (8, 2): empty (enemy could be there if enemy went DOWN from (8, 3) this turn).  \nRIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \nSo next turn from (9, 2), safe moves depend on enemy position, possibly only 1 safe move (if enemy blocks both (9, 3) and (8, 2), I have zero moves \u2192 dead).  \n\n**DOWN to (9, 0)** \u2014 no apple:  \nNew body: head (9, 0), then (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1) \u2014 tail (1, 1) disappears.  \nFrom (9, 0):  \nUP \u2192 (9, 1): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT \u2192 (8, 0): apple there now, but after this turn apple may remain or be eaten? Actually apple at (8, 0) is present now. If I go DOWN to (9, 0), next turn LEFT to (8, 0) would be safe unless enemy moves there.  \nRIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \nSo next turn from (9, 0), only possible move is LEFT to (8, 0) (if empty). That\u2019s risky (single move).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Consider enemy\u2019s likely move**  \nEnemy is long (19 apples) and occupies much of top-right. It might move toward apples or to cut me off.  \nFrom (8, 3), going DOWN to (8, 2) blocks my potential LEFT from (9, 2) next turn. Going RIGHT to (9, 3) blocks my UP from (9, 2) next turn.  \nSo if I go UP to (9, 2), enemy could block both my exits next turn.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (9, 0), enemy less likely to go to (8, 0) immediately because it\u2019s far from its head (distance 3). But enemy could still move toward center.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term safety**  \nI\u2019m trapped on right edge. Need to get off it to avoid dead ends.  \nFrom (9, 0), only LEFT next turn.  \nFrom (9, 2), maybe zero moves next turn if enemy blocks.  \n\nBetter to go DOWN to (9, 0) because:  \n- Next turn LEFT to (8, 0) is an apple (eat and grow, more options after).  \n- Enemy less likely to be at (8, 0) next turn because it\u2019s far from enemy\u2019s current head.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP is too risky because enemy can easily block both exits.  \nDOWN gives a path to an apple next turn and only one enemy path to block it (enemy would have to go (8, 3)\u2192(8, 2)\u2192(8, 1)\u2192(8, 0) in two turns, impossible).  \n\nSo DOWN now, then LEFT next turn to eat apple at (8, 0) and grow.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (9, 0), go LEFT to (8, 0) to eat apple. Then from (8, 0), possible moves UP to (8, 1) (body then, but after growth tail moves so maybe clear), need to check next turn. Goal: work toward left side apples (0, 6), (2, 5), (1, 8) while avoiding enemy\u2019s long body.  \n\nDOWN",

Wait, need to track carefully).  \nLet\u2019s simulate:  \nCurrent body: head (9, 0), then (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1).  \nAfter LEFT to (8, 0) and growth: new head (8, 0), then old head (9, 0) becomes segment 2, then (9, 1) segment 3, (8, 1) segment 4, (7, 1) segment 5, (7, 0) segment 6, (6, 0) segment 7, (5, 0) segment 8, (5, 1) segment 9, (4, 1) segment 10, (3, 1) segment 11, (2, 1) segment 12 (tail).  \nSo body segments next turn:  \n(8, 0) head,  \n(9, 0),  \n(9, 1),  \n(8, 1),  \n(7, 1),  \n(7, 0),  \n(6, 0),  \n(5, 0),  \n(5, 1),  \n(4, 1),  \n(3, 1),  \n(2, 1) tail.  \n\nFrom (8, 0) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (8, 1): occupied by my body (segment 4) \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT \u2192 (7, 0): occupied by my body (segment 6) \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9, 0): occupied by my body (segment 2) \u2192 invalid.  \n\nOh no \u2014 that means after eating apple at (8, 0), I will be completely trapped next turn with zero moves! That\u2019s fatal.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Re-evaluate**  \nThat means my only safe move this turn leads to certain death next turn.  \nBut wait \u2014 maybe I missed that the tail (1, 1) disappears when moving without apple, but with apple I grow, so tail stays.  \nLet\u2019s check:  \nCurrent length = 10 segments (head + 9 body parts).  \nEating apple \u2192 length becomes 11, so no segment is removed.  \nSo next turn body:  \nhead (8, 0),  \n(9, 0),  \n(9, 1),  \n(8, 1),  \n(7, 1),  \n(7, 0),  \n(6, 0),  \n(5, 0),  \n(5, 1),  \n(4, 1),  \n(3, 1),  \n(2, 1) \u2014 yes, all current segments remain, plus old head added.  \n\nSo indeed from (8, 0) next turn, all adjacent cells are either off board or my body.  \nThat means LEFT this turn is suicide next turn.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Is there any other possible move?**  \nFrom (9, 0):  \nUP \u2192 (9, 1) my body \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT \u2192 (8, 0) apple \u2192 safe this turn but traps next turn.  \nRIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo only one move possible, but it kills me next turn.  \nBut rules: if all moves lead to death, I must still pick one.  \nBut maybe I missed that enemy could die and free a cell? No, enemy is far.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Could enemy move into my body and die, freeing a cell?**  \nIf enemy moves into my body at (9, 1) or (8, 1) etc., that doesn\u2019t help me next turn because those cells are occupied by my body until I move.  \n\nActually, wait \u2014 if enemy dies by hitting my body, my body remains. So no change.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Conclusion**  \nI have no safe move that keeps me alive beyond this turn.  \nBut I must choose a move.  \nLEFT at least gives me +1 apple before dying.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nNone \u2014 after this turn, from (8, 0) I\u2019ll have no moves next turn and die.  \n\nLEFT",

Wait, the old segment at (8,1) will shift to (7,1) in next step? No \u2014 the body list shifts: each segment moves into the position of the previous segment. So:  \nOld segment positions:  \n0: (8,0) head  \n1: (9,0)  \n2: (9,1)  \n3: (8,1)  \n4: (7,1)  \n5: (7,0)  \n6: (6,0)  \n7: (5,0)  \n8: (5,1)  \n9: (4,1)  \n10: (3,1)  \n11: (2,1) tail  \n\nAfter moving head to (8,1):  \nNew head (8,1)  \nSegment 1: old head (8,0)  \nSegment 2: old segment 1 (9,0)  \nSegment 3: old segment 2 (9,1)  \nSegment 4: old segment 3 (8,1) \u2014 but that\u2019s the same as new head! That means collision with myself because old segment 3 is at (8,1) before moving, and I\u2019m moving head into (8,1) while old segment 3 is still there this turn. That\u2019s invalid \u2014 I\u2019d die immediately.  \n\nSo UP is invalid because (8,1) is occupied at the start of the turn.  \n\nSimilarly for LEFT (7,0): occupied at start of turn.  \nRIGHT (9,0): occupied at start of turn.  \nDOWN off board.  \n\nSo all moves are invalid at turn start.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Check if I can eat an apple to grow and avoid collision**  \nApples: (0,6), (0,0), (2,5), (1,8), (1,1) \u2014 none adjacent to (8,0).  \nSo no apple in any of the four adjacent cells.  \nTherefore moving into any adjacent cell means no growth, tail moves, but the destination cell is currently occupied by my body \u2192 immediate death.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Conclusion**  \nI have no legal moves. Every direction kills me immediately.  \nIn such a case, I must still pick a direction (rules say choose one move).  \nI\u2019ll pick UP to at least try to move into an apple if I misread coordinates, but from given data, it\u2019s fatal.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nNone \u2014 I will die this turn.  \n\nUP",
