DOWN slightly improves distance to (7,2) but reduces maneuvering space.\n\nEnemy considerations:\n- Enemy head at (7,8) is far; a head-on collision next turn is unlikely if I choose LEFT.

From (3, 3): LEFT to (2, 3) is empty, RIGHT to (4, 3) has an apple, UP goes back to (3, 4), DOWN to (3, 2) has an apple. That's actually pretty good.\n\nGoing LEFT to (2, 4):\n- From there, all 4 directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are open\n- Positions me to go to (2, 0) apple directly\n- Better proximity to (3, 2) apple\n- More escape routes if needed\n\nActually, let me reconsider. From (3, 3) going DOWN: I can reach (3, 2) apple directly and (4, 1) apple. From (2, 4) going LEFT: I can reach (2, 0) apple directly.\n\nBoth moves have merit. The key difference is that LEFT to (2, 4) gives me maximum escape options (4 open directions), while DOWN to (3, 3) also has 4 open directions but positions me closer to the apple at (4, 3) which is at (4, 3).\n\nWait - I need to also consider that the enemy at (4, 6) could move DOWN to (4, 5). That's where my body is currently! If the enemy moves DOWN and I move LEFT, my body at (3, 5) stays there. The enemy head at (4, 6) moving DOWN to (4, 5) would be into my body at (4, 5) - that would kill the enemy, not me.\n\nLet me think about the apples:\n- (4, 3) is closest to DOWN path\n- (2, 0) is closest to LEFT path\n- (3, 2) is reachable from both\n- (4, 1) is reachable from both\n\nGiven I already have 3 apples and enemy has 5, I need to prioritize. The (4, 3) apple is closest and I can reach it in 1 move (DOWN to (3, 3) then RIGHT to (4, 3)).\n\nLEFT gives me access to (2, 0) but that's farther.\n\n**Decision: DOWN** to get closer to the apple cluster at (4, 3), (4, 1), (3, 2).\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n- RIGHT -> (6,5) empty. Safe.\n\nEvaluation:\n- DOWN moves toward the apple cluster around (4,3), but the enemy at (3,2) can reach (4,3) in 2 moves (Right then Up), whereas I need 3 moves via (5,4)->(5,3)->(4,3). That makes the (4,3) apple contested and likely taken by the enemy before I get there. Moving DOWN also begins to steer me into the narrow corridor near the enemy body, reducing escape flexibility.\n- RIGHT keeps me away from the enemy cluster, preserves more open space and escape options, and brings me closer to the apple at (7,2) (distance reduced from 5 to 4). It\u2019s safer long-term and less likely to get into a head-on contest.\n\nShort plan (for next turns):\n- Move RIGHT now to (6,5). Then head toward the right-side apple at (7,2) (downward path), while staying clear of the enemy\u2019s likely routes. If the enemy disengages, consider circling back for contested apples; otherwise prioritize safe apple pickups and maintaining at least two escape options.\n\nRIGHT",

After eating: body = [(4, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)]. From there, I can go RIGHT to (5, 3), LEFT to (3, 3), UP to (4, 4), or DOWN to (4, 2). The (4, 1) apple is just DOWN from (4, 2).\n\n- **RIGHT to (4, 2):** No apple, but I could go UP to (4, 3) next turn.\n\n- **LEFT to (2, 2):** No apple, opens path to (2, 0) apple.\n\n- **DOWN to (3, 1):** No apple, gets me closer to (2, 0) but restricts movement options.\n\n**Strategic Assessment:**\n- UP to (4, 3) gives me an apple immediately\n- After eating at (4, 3), I can reach (4, 1) in two more moves: RIGHT to (5, 3), LEFT to (4, 3), then DOWN to (4, 2), DOWN to (4, 1) OR RIGHT to (5, 3), DOWN to (5, 2), LEFT to (4, 2), DOWN to (4, 1)\n- This path keeps me safe from the enemy and maximizes apple collection\n- The enemy snake at (5, 5) is not positioned to block my path to these apples\n\n**Plan:** Move UP to eat the (4, 3) apple, then work toward the (4, 1) apple. This cluster of apples (4, 3) and (4, 1) is close and gives me a good position to collect more points while staying away from the enemy.\n\nUP",
