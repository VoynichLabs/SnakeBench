Let me look at the coordinates again.\n\nThe board shows:\n- Row 9: `. . . . . . T 1 . .`\n- Row 8: `. . . . . . . . . .`\n- Row 7: `. . . . . . . . . .`\n- Row 6: `. . . . . . . . . .`\n- Row 5: `. . . A . . . . . .`\n- Row 4: `. . . . . . . . . A`\n- Row 3: `. . . . . A . . . .`\n- Row 2: `. . . . A . . . . .`\n- Row 1: `. . T 0 . . . . . .`\n- Row 0: `. . . . . . . . A .`\n\nWait, I need to understand the coordinate system. The problem states \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n\nSo the bottom row is y=0, top row is y=9. The board shows y=9 at the top, y=0 at the bottom, which matches.\n\nBut where is my head? The problem says: \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (7, 9)\"\n\nLooking at row 9 (y=9): `. . . . . . T 1 . .`\nThe \"1\" appears in the 7th position (index 7), which is (7,9). So my head is at (7,9).\n\nBut my body is `[(6, 9)]`, which would be at (6,9) - the 6th position in row 9. But the board shows \"T\" at position 6 in row 9. \n\nI think the board visualization shows:\n- \"T\" = Tail (of some snake)\n- \"0\" = Head of snake #0\n- \"1\" = Head of snake #1\n\nAnd `[(6,9)]` is my body segment, which would be at (6,9). But the board shows \"T\" there, which might be my tail.\n\nActually, re-reading: \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one, and the last tuple is the tail.\"\n\nSo for my snake: Head is (7,9), body is [(6,9)]. So the full snake is: (7,9) \u2192 (6,9). So (6,9) is my tail.\n\nThe board shows at row 9: position 7 is \"1\" (my head), position 6 is \"T\" (my tail).\n\nAnd according to my last move info: \"My head at (6,9) - I moved RIGHT last turn as planned\"\nWait, that was from my previous thinking. Let me check what my last move actually was.\n\nThe user says: \"Your last move information: ... **START LAST MOVE PICK** RIGHT **END LAST MOVE PICK**\"\n\nSo I moved RIGHT last turn. Before that move, my head was at (6,9). After moving RIGHT, my head is at (7,9). That matches the current board.\n\nSo my current state is:\n- Head: (7,9)\n- Body: [(6,9)]\n- Previous head was at (6,9)\n\nNow, from (7,9), I need to consider moves:\n\n**Board state check from (7,9):**\n- UP: (7,10) - y=10 > 9, **OUT OF BOARD - DEAD**\n- DOWN: (7,8) - check if empty\n- LEFT: (6,9) - this is my current body segment (tail). Moving here would be moving backwards into myself - **DEAD**\n- RIGHT: (8,9) - check if empty\n\nLet me examine the board for row 9: `. . . . . . T 1 . .`\nPositions: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n- Position 6: \"T\" (my tail)\n- Position 7: \"1\" (my head)\n- Position 8: \".\" (empty)\n- Position 9: \".\" (empty)\n\nSo from (7,9):\n- DOWN to (7,8): Row 8 shows all dots, so (7,8) is empty. Safe.\n- LEFT to (6,9): That's my tail, and it's directly behind me. Moving into your own body kills you. **UNSAFE**\n- RIGHT to (8,9): Empty cell. Safe.\n- UP: Off board. **UNSAFE**\n\nSafe options: DOWN, RIGHT\n\nNow I need to evaluate which is better.\n\n**Option: RIGHT to (8,9)**\n- Target: (9,4) apple is southeast of here\n- Next turn from (8,9), I could move DOWN toward the apple\n- But (8,9) is getting closer to the board edge\n\n**Option: DOWN to (7,8)**\n- Moves me toward the central apples: (5,3), (3,5), etc.\n- Gives me more flexibility to navigate the board\n- Keeps me away from the top edge\n\nLooking at the apples: (9,4), (5,3), (3,5), (4,2), (8,0)\nFrom (7,9), the path DOWN seems better to reach the cluster of apples in the center.\n\nAlso, I need to consider enemy snake #0 at (3,1) with body [(2,1)]. They're far away, but moving down puts me closer to the action.\n\nLet me think about safety. If I go DOWN to (7,8):\n- Next turn options from (7,8): UP (back to 7,9), DOWN (7,7), LEFT (6,8), RIGHT (8,8)\n- All these cells appear empty on the board\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,9):\n- Next turn options from (8,9): UP (off board), DOWN (8,8), LEFT (7,9 - my old position, but now it's my body), RIGHT (9,9)\n- From (8,9), LEFT would be moving into my previous position (7,9), which will be occupied by my tail after I move. So that's unsafe.\n- So only DOWN and RIGHT are safe from (8,9), and RIGHT gets me to a corner (9,9) which might be a trap.\n\nSo DOWN seems to give me more options and better positioning.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. My current tail is at (6,9). After I move, my tail will stay at (6,9) until I eat an apple. So if I move DOWN to (7,8):\n- New head: (7,8)\n- Body: (7,9) (old head)\n- Tail: (6,9) (unchanged)\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8,9):\n- New head: (8,9)\n- Body: (7,9)\n- Tail: (6,9)\n\nBoth are safe. But DOWN seems strategically better because:\n1. It moves me toward the center where more apples are clustered\n2. It keeps me away from the edge where I might get trapped\n3. It gives me more movement options in future turns\n\n**Final decision: DOWN**\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move DOWN toward the central apples. After reaching the middle, I can target the apple at (5,3) or (3,5). Keep an eye on snake #0 at the bottom-left, but they're currently far away.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

T 1 . .` (this is my body: tail at (6,9) and head at (7,9)? Wait, this doesn't match...)\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy. The board shows at row 9: position 7 has \"1\", and position 6 has \"T\". But the text says my head is (7,8) and my body is [(7,9)].\n\nLet me re-read the board representation. The text shows:\n```\n9 . . . . . . . T . .\n8 . . . . . . . 1 . .\n```\n\nSo row 9 (y=9) has a \"T\" at column 6 and a \"1\" at column 7? No, that can't be right because my head is at (7,8).\n\nActually, looking at the board more carefully:\n- Row 9: `. . . . . . . T . .` - This shows \"T\" at position 7 (x=7)\n- Row 8: `. . . . . . . 1 . .` - This shows \"1\" at position 7 (x=7)\n\nBut the text says my head is at (7,8) and my body is [(7,9)]. So (7,9) would be at row 9, column 7. But row 9 shows \"T\" at column 7, not \"1\".\n\nI think there's some confusion in the board representation. Let me trust the explicit coordinates given:\n- My head: (7, 8)\n- My body: [(7, 9)]\n\nSo the snake occupies (7,8) as head and (7,9) as the only body segment.\n\nNow, evaluating moves from (7,8):\n- **UP**: Would move to (7,9). But (7,9) is my own body segment (based on the body list). Moving into your own body kills you. **UNSAFE**\n- **DOWN**: Would move to (7,7). Check board at (7,7): Row 7 is all dots, so empty. **SAFE**\n- **LEFT**: Would move to (6,8). Row 8 shows position 6 is a dot. **SAFE**\n- **RIGHT**: Would move to (8,8). Row 8 shows position 8 is a dot. **SAFE**\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT\n\nNow, which move is optimal?\n\n**Apples:** (9,4), (5,3), (3,5), (4,2), (8,0)\nMy position: (7,8)\n\n**Option analysis:**\n- **DOWN to (7,7)**: Moves closer to central apples, keeps me away from top edge. From (7,7) I can reach (5,3) and others.\n- **LEFT to (6,8)**: Moves toward left side, away from apples mostly.\n- **RIGHT to (8,8)**: Moves right, closer to apple at (9,4) but also toward board corner.\n\n**Long-term strategy:** The central cluster of apples at (5,3), (3,5), (4,2) seems most promising. Moving DOWN positions me to approach them. Also, DOWN keeps me in more open space with more future options.\n\n**Enemy snake #0**: At (4,1) with body at (3,1). They're near the bottom-left, far from my current position. I don't need to worry about them immediately.\n\n**Enemy snake #0**: At (4,1) with body at (3,1). They're near the bottom-left, far from my current position. I don't need to worry about them immediately.\n\n**Final decision:** DOWN is the best move. It moves me toward the central apple cluster while keeping multiple future options open and avoiding dangerous edges.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move DOWN toward the central apples. Target the cluster at (5,3), (3,5), (4,2). Avoid getting trapped near the edges. Monitor enemy snake #0 but they're currently not an immediate threat.\nDOWN",

It also keeps me horizontal with the apple at (5, 7), which I am now closer to (distance 2 vs previous 1, but safer path).\n*   **Why not LEFT/RIGHT?** Turning LEFT or RIGHT now would be erratic. Sticking to the plan of approaching the central apples (specifically the cluster at (5,3), (3,5)) from a safe distance is better.\n*   **Avoiding Snake #0:** By moving DOWN to y=5, I avoid moving towards (5, 2) where Snake #0 is. If I continued straight towards (5, 3), I might intercept Snake #0.

It could move UP to (5, 4), creating a potential conflict if I stay in the column 7/8 region. However, immediate collision is unlikely.\n    *   Strategic Note: Moving DOWN moves me away from the central apples and closer to the bottom edge. While safe momentarily, it might be a dead end.\n\n3.  **LEFT (6, 5):**\n    *   Target: (6, 5).\n    *   Status: Empty.\n    *   Threat Analysis: Safe immediately.\n    *   Strategic Note: This moves me towards the central apples (specifically (5, 7) and potential future apples).

It also places me closer to (8, 0), but that requires going DOWN significantly. It restricts movement slightly to the right wall, but offers a clear target (9,4).\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nI am currently in column 7. Snake #0 is in column 5. The open space is generous.\n- **LEFT (6,5)** opens up the central board and the apple at (5,7). It seems the most flexible move for long-term play, allowing me to chase the central cluster.\n- **RIGHT (8,5)** chases the apple at (9,4). This is a \"side quest\" but a valid one.\n- **DOWN (7,4)** feels like I'm ceding the central territory to Snake #0. If I go DOWN, Snake #0 will likely eat the central apples (3,5) or (5,3).\n\nGiven that I am behind, I must be aggressive. The central apples (5,7) and (3,5) are high value. By moving LEFT, I position myself to intercept Snake #0 or claim the central apples.\nHowever, looking at the board again, the apple at (9,4) is very close. Distance is 2.\nThe apple at (5,7) is distance 3.\nThe apple at (3,5) is distance 5.\nThe apple at (7,9) is distance 4.\nThe apple at (8,0) is distance 9.\n\nThe most immediate opportunity is the **RIGHT** move towards (9,4). It is safe and profitable.\n**UPDATE on Strategy:** The rationale in the previous turn suggested avoiding rushing Snake #0. Moving LEFT puts me directly in the mix with Snake #0. Moving RIGHT isolates me on the right side where there is an apple at (9,4) and another at (8,0).\nLet's check safety of RIGHT again. Snake #0 is at (5,3). It cannot reach (8,5) in one turn.\nLet's check safety of LEFT. Snake #0 is at (5,3). It cannot reach (6,5) in one turn.\n\nWhy choose RIGHT over LEFT?\nSnake #0 is likely to go for (3,5) or (5,3). If I go LEFT, I am entering a contested zone. If I go RIGHT, I am securing a safe apple at (9,4). After eating (9,4), I can decide to go DOWN to (8,0) or UP to (7,9) or LEFT back to the center.\nThe RIGHT move also avoids the potential \"box\" that Snake #0 might create around column 5/6.\nAlso, note the body of Snake #0 blocks the approach to (3,5) from the bottom. Approaching (3,5) might be tricky.\nTherefore, securing the safe points on the right flank seems the optimal tactical decision.\n\n**Conclusion:** I will move RIGHT to secure the apple at (9, 4). This is a safe move that yields a point and avoids immediate conflict with Snake #0.\n**END RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

Moving RIGHT puts me at (9,5), which is adjacent to the apple and grants access to the right edge.\nSnake #0 is at (5,4). The apple at (9,4) is safer than the central apples because Snake #0 is far away (Manhattan distance 4). Snake #0 is likely to chase the apple at (3,5) or (5,7) (or perhaps (5,3) which is right next to it, though that looks like its tail? The board shows `T` at (5,3) but the enemy description says that's its tail... wait, enemy description says Body: [(5,3), ...]. If (5,3) is body, and head is (5,4), the apple at (5,3) on the board is actually part of the snake? No, the board state shows `A` at (9,4), (3,5), etc. It shows `T` at (5,3). The enemy list says Body: [(5,3), ...]. So (5,3) is occupied. The apple at (5,3) is not there.\nWait, looking at the board state:\nRow 4: `... . 0 . . . A` at col 9.

So (5,3) is Tail.\nSo the apples are as listed: (9,4), (3,5), (8,0), (5,7), (7,9).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5) is safe and gets me next to the apple at (9,4).\nIf I move DOWN to (8,4), I am next to (9,4) but also closer to the center.\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am moving away from the closest apple.\n\nWhy is (9,5) better than (8,4)?\n(9,5) is the far right edge.

If I move RIGHT to (9,5), I can go DOWN to (9,4) to eat.\nIf I move DOWN to (8,4), I can go RIGHT to (9,4) to eat.\nIs there any reason to avoid (9,5)?\nSnake #0 is at (5,4). It is far.\nThe only potential threat is if Snake #0 goes for (5,7) or (3,5) and somehow blocks me later. But securing a point now is important since I am down 1-3.\n\nLet's check safety of RIGHT again.\nCurrent Head: (8,5). Target: (9,5).\nBoard row 5: `... . T 1 .` (cols 7, 8, 9).

From there I can go DOWN to (9,4).\nGoing DOWN puts me at (8,4). From there I can go RIGHT to (9,4).\nGoing UP puts me at (8,6). From there I can go DOWN then RIGHT, etc.\n\nThe apple at (9,4) is on the edge.\nIf I move RIGHT, I trap myself against the wall slightly more.\nIf I move DOWN, I stay in the column 8, which is more open.\nHowever, the apple is at (9,4).\nIf I move DOWN now, I am at (8,4). Next turn I can move RIGHT to (9,4) and eat.\nIf I move RIGHT now, I am at (9,5). Next turn I can move DOWN to (9,4) and eat.\n\nIs there a risk of collision?\nSnake #0 is at (5,4). It moves 1 step.\nIf it moves RIGHT to (6,4), distance to me (8,5 or 8,4 or 9,5) is still large.\nIf it moves UP to (5,5), distance is large.\nIf it moves DOWN to (5,3), distance is large.\n\nWhy prefer RIGHT over DOWN?\nThe board is 10x10. (9,5) is on the right wall. (8,4) is one step off the wall.\nMoving RIGHT secures the line to the apple at (9,4). If I go DOWN to (8,4), and Snake #0 comes running towards the center, I might get squeezed.\nActually, Snake #0 is at (5,4). It is heading towards the apples at (3,5), (5,7), (8,0).\nI am at the edge. I should take the apple at (9,4).\nIf I go DOWN (8,4), I am closer to Snake #0 than if I go RIGHT (9,5).\nDistance from (5,4) to (8,4) is 3.\nDistance from (5,4) to (9,5) is 5.\nRIGHT puts me further away from the enemy.\n\nAlso, note the apple at (8,0). From (9,5), I can go DOWN, DOWN, DOWN... to (9,0), then LEFT to (8,0).\nFrom (8,4), I can go DOWN... to (8,0).\n(9,5) allows a clear path down the right side.\n\nHowever, looking at the board state again.\nRow 5: `... T 1 .` at (7,5), (8,5).\nRow 4: `... 0 . . . A` at (5,4) and (9,4).\nRow 9: `... . . A .` at (7,9) (wait, board row 9 is `... . . A .`? No, row 9 is `9 . . . . . . . A . .`. That's (7,9)).\nSo apples at (7,9) and (9,4) are top right.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am positioned perfectly to eat (9,4).\nIf I move UP to (8,6), I am moving towards (7,9).\nIf I move DOWN to (8,4), I am moving towards (9,4).\n\nWait, if I move RIGHT to (9,5), I can eat (9,4) next turn.\nIf I move DOWN to (8,4), I can eat (9,4) next turn.\nWhy choose?\nIf I move RIGHT, my tail (7,5) stays.\nIf I move DOWN, my tail (7,5) stays.\nThe difference is the head position for the next turn.\nIf I move RIGHT -> (9,5) -> DOWN -> (9,4) [Eat].\nIf I move DOWN -> (8,4) -> RIGHT -> (9,4) [Eat].\nIn the first case, I end up at (9,4) with body going through (9,5), (8,5).\nIn the second case, I end up at (9,4) with body going through (8,4), (8,5).\n\nIf I move DOWN now, I am at (8,4).\nSnake #0 at (5,4).\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6,4), then UP to (6,5), it is approaching.\nIf I move RIGHT now, I am at (9,5).\nSnake #0 has to travel much further to threaten me.\n\nAlso, I should consider the apple at (8,0).\nFrom (9,4), I can go DOWN to (9,3) ... to (9,0), then LEFT to (8,0).\nFrom (9,4), going LEFT is blocked by my body (9,5) -> (8,5).\nActually, if I eat at (9,4), my tail is at (7,5).\nIf I go DOWN from (9,4) to (9,3), my body becomes (9,4), (8,5), (7,5).\nThen (9,2), (9,1), (9,0).\nThen LEFT to (8,0).\nThis is a valid path.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8,4) now.\nSnake #0 at (5,4).\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6,4), it is getting closer to me.\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), Snake #0 is very far.\n\nThe board state shows `.` at (9,5).\nThe board state shows `.` at (8,4).\nThe board state shows `.` at (8,6).\n\nI am currently at (8,5).\nMy tail is at (7,5).\nLEFT is death.\nUP is safe but moves away from the closest apple (9,4).\nDOWN is safe and moves towards (9,4) and (8,0).\nRIGHT is safe and moves towards (9,4).\n\nLet's compare DOWN vs RIGHT for the apple at (9,4).\nManhattan distance to (9,4) from (8,5) is 2.\nPath 1: DOWN (8,4) -> RIGHT (9,4). 2 moves. Eats apple.\nPath 2: RIGHT (9,5) -> DOWN (9,4). 2 moves. Eats apple.\n\nIf I move DOWN now, my head is at (8,4).\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6,4), it is at x=6. I am at x=8.\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (5,5), it is at y=5. I am at y=4.\nNothing immediate.\n\nIf I move RIGHT now, my head is at (9,5).\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6,4), it is at x=6. I am at x=9.\nThis seems safer.\n\nAlso, looking at the board, the apple at (3,5) is near Snake #0.\nSnake #0 will likely go for that.\nI should secure my points.\n\nIs there any reason to move UP?\nIf I move UP, I head towards (7,9).\nDistance to (7,9) from (8,6) is... (8,6) -> (7,6) -> (7,7) ... no, distance is |8-7| + |6-9| = 4.\nFrom (8,4), distance is 5.\nFrom (9,5), distance is 3 (|9-7| + |5-9| = 2+4=6? No. (9,5) to (7,9): |9-7| + |5-9| = 2+4=6).\nWait, (9,5) to (7,9) is 2 left, 4 up = 6.\n(8,5) to (7,9) is 1 left, 4 up = 5.\n(8,6) to (7,9) is 1 left, 3 up = 4.\nSo UP is best for (7,9).\nHowever, (9,4) is distance 2.\n(8,0) is distance 9.\n(5,7) is distance 5.\n(3,5) is distance 6.\n(7,9) is distance 5.\n\n(9,4) is the closest.\nI should chase (9,4).\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT.\nRIGHT puts me on the edge.\nDOWN puts me one step off the edge.\nOn the edge, I have fewer moves (can't go RIGHT).\nOff the edge, I have more moves.\nHowever, if I am on the edge (9,5), I can go DOWN, LEFT, UP.\nIf I am at (8,4), I can go DOWN, LEFT, UP, RIGHT.\n(8,4) is more flexible.\nBut I want to get to (9,4).\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), I can go RIGHT to (9,4) next turn.\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I can go DOWN to (9,4) next turn.\n\nLet's look at the turn order. We move simultaneously.\nSnake #0 is at (5,4).\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), Snake #0 could go RIGHT to (6,4) or UP to (5,5).\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), Snake #0 goes wherever.\nThe conflict zone is far away.\n\nThe prompt says \"prefer moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available\".\n(8,4) allows 4 directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n(9,5) allows 3 directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT).\nSo (8,4) is better for keeping options open.\n\nBut wait. If I am at (8,4), I am closer to the center. Snake #0 is at the center.\nIf I am at (9,5), I am on the flank.\nI want to avoid Snake #0.\nSnake #0 wants to eat the apples in the center or bottom left.\nI want to eat (9,4) and (8,0).\nGoing DOWN now gets me closer to (8,0) as well.\n(8,4) -> (8,3) -> ... -> (8,0).\n(9,5) -> (9,4) -> (9,3) -> ... -> (9,0) -> (8,0).\nThe path via (8,4) is shorter for (8,0) (4 steps vs 5 steps).\nThe path via (9,5) is shorter for (9,4) (2 steps vs 2 steps).\n\nIs there a threat to (9,4)?\nSnake #0 is at (5,4). Distance is 4.\nIt would take Snake #0 4 turns to reach (9,4).\nI can reach it in 2.\nSo I can definitely get it.\n\nSo the choice is between DOWN and RIGHT.\nLet's re-read the last move rationale.\n\"Moving RIGHT puts me at the right edge. If I don't eat the apple, I'm stuck.\"\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5) and then don't eat (9,4), I am stuck.\nIf I move DOWN to (8,4), I have more flexibility.\n\nHowever, I am going to eat (9,4).\nIf I move RIGHT -> (9,5) -> DOWN -> (9,4) [Eat].\nIf I move DOWN -> (8,4) -> RIGHT -> (9,4) [Eat].\nIn the first sequence, I am at (9,5) then (9,4).\nIn the second sequence, I am at (8,4) then (9,4).\n\nConsider the apple at (8,0).\nIf I move DOWN now to (8,4), I am on the path to (8,0).\nIf I move RIGHT now to (9,5), I am on the path to (9,4) then (9,0) then (8,0).\n(8,4) is better for (8,0).\n\nIs there a reason to move RIGHT?\nThe board shows a dot at (9,5).\nWait, look at the board again.\nRow 5: `5 . . . A . . . T 1 .` -> `(0,5)` is `.`, `(1,5)` is `.`, `(2,5)` is `.`, `(3,5)` is `A`, `(4,5)` is `.`, `(5,5)` is `.`, `(6,5)` is `.`, `(7,5)` is `T`, `(8,5)` is `1`, `(9,5)` is `.`.\nYes, (9,5) is empty.\n\nLet's look at Snake #0.\nHead: (5,4).\nBody: [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2)].\nBoard shows:\nRow 4: `... . 0 . . . A` -> (5,4) is `0`.\nRow 3: `... . T . . .` -> (5,3) is `T`.\nRow 2: `... . T T . . .` -> (5,2) is `T`, (4,2) is `T`.\nThis matches.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8,4), I am at x=8, y=4.\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (5,5), we are far.\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6,4), we are far.\n\nWait, let's look at the last move rationale again.\n\"My Head: (7, 5)\"\n\"My Body: [(7, 6)]\"\nWait, the history says:\n\"My Head: (7, 5)\"\n\"My Body: [(7, 6)]\"\nThen \"My Head: (8, 5)\"\n\"Body: [(7, 5)]\"\nSo I moved RIGHT.\nMy body is now (7, 5).\nSo I cannot go LEFT.\nCorrect.\n\nIs there any danger of Snake #0 moving to (8,4) or (9,5)?\nSnake #0 is at (5,4). It takes 3 moves to (8,4) and 4 moves to (9,5).\nIt cannot reach me this turn or the next.\n\nSo, UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\nLEFT is death.\n\nWhy choose DOWN?\nI am at (8,5).\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), I am closer to (8,0).\nIf I go UP to (8,6), I am closer to (7,9).\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I am closer to (9,4).\nI need to prioritize.\nI am losing 1-3.\nI need points.\n(9,4) is distance 2.\n(8,0) is distance 9.\n(7,9) is distance 4.\n(5,7) is distance 4.\n(3,5) is distance 6.\n\n(9,4) is the closest.\nSo I should move towards (9,4).\nTowards (9,4) means DOWN (to 8,4) or RIGHT (to 9,5).\n\nIf I move DOWN, I am at (8,4).\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6,4), I am still safe.\nIf I move RIGHT, I am at (9,5).\n\nIs there a benefit to staying in column 8?\nColumn 9 is the edge. Column 8 is one step in.\nIf I go to (9,5), I have to come back LEFT eventually if I want to go to the center.\nIf I go to (8,4), I can stay flexible.\n\nHowever, I want to eat (9,4).\nIf I eat (9,4), my head will be at (9,4).\nIf I approach from (9,5), my body will be (9,5), (8,5), (7,5).\nIf I approach from (8,4), my body will be (9,4), (8,5), (7,5).\nThe path via (8,4) gives me a \"tail\" at (7,5) and (8,5).\nThe path via (9,5) gives me a \"tail\" at (8,5) and (7,5).\n\nWait, if I move DOWN to (8,4) -> RIGHT to (9,4) [Eat].\nMy body becomes (9,4), (8,5), (7,5).\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5) -> DOWN to (9,4) [Eat].\nMy body becomes (9,4), (9,5), (8,5).\nIn the second case, my tail is (8,5).\nIn the first case, my tail is (7,5).\n\nIf I eat the apple, I grow.\nSo if I move DOWN -> RIGHT:\nTurn 8: Head (8,4), Body (8,5), (7,5). (Tail 7,5)\nTurn 9: Head (9,4) [Eat], Body (8,4), (8,5), (7,5). (Tail 7,5)\nTurn 10: Head... if I go DOWN to (9,3), Body (9,4), (8,4), (8,5), (7,5). (Tail 7,5)\n\nIf I move RIGHT -> DOWN:\nTurn 8: Head (9,5), Body (8,5), (7,5). (Tail 7,5)\nTurn 9: Head (9,4) [Eat], Body (9,5), (8,5), (7,5). (Tail 7,5)\nTurn 10: Head... if I go DOWN to (9,3), Body (9,4), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5). (Tail 7,5)\n\nIn both cases, after eating, I have the same tail (7,5) initially.\nBut in the RIGHT->DOWN path, my body is (9,5), (8,5) before eating.\nIn the DOWN->RIGHT path, my body is (8,4), (8,5) before eating.\n\nIf I move DOWN now to (8,4), I am one step closer to (8,0).\nIf I move RIGHT now to (9,5), I am blocking myself from going RIGHT again.\n(8,4) is a more central location than (9,5).\nI can always move RIGHT on the next turn if I move DOWN now.\nIf I move RIGHT now, I am on the edge.\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\n(9,4) is the closest.\n(8,0) is the second closest (distance 9).\n(7,9) is distance 4.\n(5,7) is distance 4.\n(3,5) is distance 6.\n\nWait, distance from (8,5) to (5,7) is |8-5| + |5-7| = 3 + 2 = 5.\nDistance to (8,0) is 5 (|8-8| + |5-0| = 5).\nWait, (8,0) is at x=8, y=0. I am at x=8, y=5. Distance is 5.\n(5,7) is at x=5, y=7. I am at x=8, y=5. Distance is 3+2=5.\n(9,4) is distance 2.\n(7,9) is distance 1+4=5.\n(3,5) is distance 5+0=5.\n\nSo (9,4) is definitely the target.\nI must go DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nSnake #0 is at (5,4).\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (5,5), then it might go for (5,7).\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6,4), it might go for (8,0) or (9,4)? No, (9,4) is too far.\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN, it goes to (5,3) which is its tail? No, (5,3) is body.\nWait, Snake #0 Body is [(5,3), (5,2), (4,2)].\nSo (5,3) is occupied.\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN, it hits its own body. Snake #0 cannot move DOWN.\nSnake #0 can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8,4), I am at y=4.\nSnake #0 is at y=4.\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6,4), it is at y=4.\nIf I move DOWN, I am at (8,4).\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6,4), no collision.\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), I am at y=5.\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (5,5), it is at y=5.\nNo collision.\n\nIs there any scenario where I am threatened?\nSnake #0 could move RIGHT to (6,4) then RIGHT to (7,4) then RIGHT to (8,4).\nThat would take 3 turns.\nI can eat (9,4) in 2 turns and then leave.\nSo I am safe.\n\nWhy prefer DOWN over RIGHT?\nIf I go DOWN to (8,4), I keep the right side open.\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,5), I close off the right side for this turn.\n(8,4) is simply a more flexible square.\nFrom (8,4), I can go DOWN to (8,3) towards (8,0).\nI can go RIGHT to (9,4) to eat.\nI can go LEFT to (7,4) to escape.\nI can go UP to (8,5) (but that's my body).\nActually, (8,5) will be my body if I move DOWN.\nSo from (8,4), available moves next turn are:\nDOWN (8,3), RIGHT (9,4), LEFT (7,4).\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nFrom (9,5) (if I move RIGHT), next turn:\nDOWN (9,4), LEFT (8,5), UP (9,6).\n(8,5) will be my body. So LEFT is death.\nSo from (9,5), available moves next turn are:\nDOWN (9,4), UP (9,6).\nThat's 2 moves.\n\nFrom (8,4), I have 3 moves. From (9,5), I have 2 moves.\n(8,4) is better for keeping options open.\n\nTherefore, I should move DOWN.\n\nWait, let me double check the \"backwards\" rule.\n\"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nMy head is (8,5). My body is (7,5).\nThe cell behind my head is (7,5).\nSo moving LEFT is death.\nCorrect.\n\nSo, UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\nI prefer DOWN because it gives me more options next turn and moves me towards the target (9,4) while maintaining a central position (column 8).\n\nWait, moving DOWN moves me from (8,5) to (8,4).\nThis is closer to (8,0) (y=0).\nIt is also closer to (9,4) (distance 2 -> distance 1 via RIGHT).\nIt is also closer to Snake #0? Snake #0 is at (5,4). I am at (8,4). Distance 3.\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), distance to Snake #0 is |9-5| + |5-4| = 5.\nSo RIGHT is further from Snake #0.\nBut Snake #0 is not a threat this turn.\nThe threat is getting trapped.\nI am at the edge of the board (x=8, y=5). x=8 is not the edge (edge is 9).\nWait, x=9 is the edge.\nSo (8,5) is one step from the edge.\n(9,5) is on the edge.\n(8,4) is one step from the edge.\n\nIf I am on the edge, I have fewer escape routes.\nIf I am off the edge, I have more.\nTherefore, staying off the edge is better.\n(8,4) is off the edge. (9,5) is on the edge.\nSo (8,4) is better.\n\nAlso, I want to eat (8,0).\nIf I go DOWN now, I am one step closer to (8,0).\nIf I go RIGHT now, I am further away from (8,0) (y=5 vs y=4).\nWait, (9,5) to (8,0) is 5 down, 1 left.\n(8,4) to (8,0) is 4 down.\nSo (8,4) is better for (8,0).\n\nThe only reason to go RIGHT is if DOWN is blocked. It is not.\n\nSo, I will move DOWN.\n\nWait, let's check if Snake #0 can intercept me at (8,4) or (9,5).\nNo, it can't.\n\nFinal check:\nCurrent Head: (8,5)\nBody: (7,5)\nTarget: (9,4) (closest apple)\nOptions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\nDOWN: (8,4). Safe. Good position.\nRIGHT: (9,5). Safe. Edge position.\nUP: (8,6). Safe. Further from (9,4).\n\nI choose DOWN.\n\nWait, let's look at the board again.\nRow 4: `... . 0 . . . A` at (9,4).\nSo (9,4) is an apple.\nRow 5: `... . T 1 .`\nRow 6: `... . . . . .`\nRow 7: `... . A . . .` at (5,7).\nRow 8: `... . . . . .`\nRow 9: `... . . A . .` at (7,9).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8,4), I am at the same y-level as Snake #0.\nSnake #0 is at (5,4).\nI am at (8,4).\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT, it goes to (6,4).\nIf Snake #0 moves UP, it goes to (5,5).\nIf I move DOWN, I go to (8,4).\nIs there any chance Snake #0 can move to (8,4)?\nNo.\n\nIs there any chance I can be cut off?\nIf Snake #0 moves UP and then RIGHT, it might try to block (7,4) or something.\nBut that's 2 turns away.\nI will be at (9,4) in 2 turns.\n\nI am confident in DOWN.\n\nWait, one detail.\nThe prompt says \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (8, 5), Body: [(7, 5)]\".\nSo my body is exactly (7,5).\nIf I move DOWN, my new head is (8,4).\nMy body will be (8,5), (7,5).\nThis is valid.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, my new head is (9,5).\nMy body will be (8,5), (7,5).\nThis is valid.\n\nIf I move UP, my new head is (8,6).\nMy body will be (8,5), (7,5).\nThis is valid.\n\nDOWN is the move.\n\nStrategy note:\nI will move DOWN to (8,4) to position myself for the apple at (9,4) while staying flexible and avoiding the edge. Snake #0 is far away. I will secure the points on the right side.\n\nDOWNDOWN",

This is safe and moves me directly toward the apple at (5, 7).\n- **DOWN**: Moves to (5, 4). This is my neck. **Result: Death.**\n- **LEFT**: Moves to (4, 5). Path toward the apple at (3, 5). Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to (6, 5). Moves toward the center/right. Safe.\n\n**Collision Risk with Snake #1:**\nSnake #1 is at (8, 4). Their possible moves are (8, 5), (8, 3), (7, 4), or (9, 4).\nThey are 3 units away on the X-axis and 1 unit away on the Y-axis. There is no risk of a head-on collision this turn regardless of my move. Snake #1 is likely going for the apple at (9, 4) or (8, 0).\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nThe apple at (5, 7) is my primary target as it is the closest (2 moves away). Moving UP puts me at (5, 6), setting up to take the apple on the following turn. Staying on the X=5 line is efficient. Moving toward (3, 5) via LEFT is also an option, but (5, 7) is less likely to be contested by Snake #1 right now.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will move UP to take the apple at (5, 7). After that, I will evaluate the position of Snake #1. If they have moved away from the bottom right, I may loop down for the apple at (8, 0) or head toward the top-right for (7, 9). I must ensure I don't get boxed in along the top wall.\n\nUP",

Body: [(8, 1), (8, 2)].\n*   **Apples:** (9, 4), (3, 5), (7, 9), (9, 8), (7, 7).\n\n**Evaluation of Moves:**\n*   **UP**: Moves to (6, 9). Safe. This puts me adjacent to the apple at (7, 9).\n*   **DOWN**: Moves to (6, 7). Safe. This puts me adjacent to the apple at (7, 7).\n*   **LEFT**: Moves to (5, 8). **Result: Death** (moves into own neck).\n*   **RIGHT**: Moves to (7, 8). Safe. This puts me directly between apples at (7, 9), (7, 7), and (9, 8).\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nI am currently at (6, 8). There are three apples very close to me: (7, 9), (9, 8), and (7, 7).\n- Apple at (7, 9) is 2 steps away via (7, 8) then UP.\n- Apple at (7, 7) is 2 steps away via (7, 8) then DOWN.\n- Apple at (9, 8) is 3 steps away via (7, 8), (8, 8), then (9, 8).\n\nSnake #1 is at (8, 0), far away from the clusters I am targeting. It likely wants the apple at (9, 4).\n\nMoving **RIGHT** to (7, 8) is the most flexible move. From (7, 8), I can choose based on safety and efficiency whether to go for (7, 9) first or (7, 7) first. Since (7, 9) and (9, 8) are higher up, taking (7, 9) first keeps me away from the center where the enemy might eventually travel.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove to (7, 8), then take (7, 9). After collecting (7, 9), I will assess (9, 8) and (7, 7). Given the snake's current length, there is no immediate risk of trapping myself in the corners.

Body: [(7, 4), (7, 3)].\n*   **Apples:** (9, 4), (3, 5), (7, 7), (4, 5), (5, 3).\n\n**Evaluation of Moves for ID 0:**\n*   **UP:** Target (9, 8). This is my current neck/body segment. **Result: Death.**\n*   **RIGHT:** Target (10, 7). Out of bounds. **Result: Death.**\n*   **LEFT:** Target (8, 7). This cell is safe. It is 1 step away from the apple at (7, 7), but also puts me in the path of Snake #1 if they move UP toward (7, 7) or (7, 6).\n*   **DOWN:** Target (9, 6). This cell is safe. It moves me closer to the apple at (9, 4).\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n*   Apple (7, 7) is very close. If I move LEFT to (8, 7), I can likely grab (7, 7) on the next turn.\n*   Apple (9, 4) is directly below me along the wall.\n*   Snake #1 is at (7, 5). They are likely targeting the apple at (7, 7) or the cluster at (3, 5)/(4, 5).\n*   If both I and Snake #1 go for (7, 7), we might collide or I might get cut off because my body is long and curled at the top right, creating a bit of a bottleneck for myself.\n*   Moving LEFT to (8, 7) is aggressive. Moving DOWN to (9, 6) is safer and maintains my lead.\n*   Let's check the body: If I move LEFT to (8, 7), the tail at (6, 8) moves to (7, 8). (7, 8) is currently a body segment. The snake will clear that space.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving LEFT to (8, 7) is the most efficient path to the nearest apple at (7, 7). Following that, I can head down to (9, 4). Snake #1 is at (7, 5); if they move UP, they reach (7, 6). If they move UP again, they reach (7, 7). By moving LEFT now, I occupy (8, 7), and next turn I can take (7, 7) before they can reach it or contest it safely.\n\nLEFT",

The path of the enemy suggests a descent from the top-right corner. This is concerning because the enemy is moving down towards the y-level of my head (y=5). Their body currently blocks the row `y=8` and `y=9` on the right side. The cell `(7, 7)` is a target apple, but it is only 2 steps away from the enemy's body at `(7, 8)` and `(7, 9)`. If the enemy continues moving down or left, it may encroach on my planned path.\n\n3.  **Apples:**\n    *   **Target 1:** `(7, 7)` is UP from my head `(7, 5)`. Distance: 2.\n    *   **Target 2:** `(9, 4)` is RIGHT from my head `(7, 5)`. Distance: 2. (Note: `(8, 4)` and `(9, 4)` are the steps).\n    *   **Target 3:** `(5, 3)` is DOWN-LEFT.\n\n4.  **Move Evaluation (from `(7, 5)`):**\n\n    *   **UP to `(7, 6)`:**\n        *   **Safety:** Currently empty. No body collision.\n        *   **Risk Analysis:** This is the direct path to `(7, 7)`. However, this moves me directly towards the column `x=7` where the enemy has heavy traffic. The enemy is at `(9, 7)` but has a long tail at `(7, 9)`. If the enemy decides to move left along the top or drops down further, I risk a head-on collision or being cut off. Also, if I go UP to `(7, 6)`, my tail will still be at `(7, 3)`. This leaves the cell `(7, 4)` (currently my body) open to being moved into by another snake *after* I leave it, but that's only a threat if I trap myself.\n        *   **Crucial Risk:** The enemy is at `(9, 7)`. If the enemy moves `LEFT` to `(8, 7)`, it is adjacent to `(7, 7)`. If I am at `(7, 6)` and go for `(7, 7)`, the enemy could reach `(7, 7)` simultaneously from `(8, 7)` (if it moves `LEFT` again, that's `(7, 7)`). Actually, `LEFT` from `(8, 7)` is `(7, 7)`. So if the enemy moves `LEFT` to `(8, 7)` this turn, it threatens the apple at `(7, 7)` next turn. This makes going UP risky.\n\n    *   **DOWN to `(7, 4)`:**\n        *   **Safety:** This is my current body segment. **DEAD**.\n\n    *   **LEFT to `(6, 5)`:**\n        *   **Safety:** Empty.\n        *   **Strategy:** Moves me away from the immediate conflict zone near `x=7` and `x=8`. It is safe, but moves away from the closest apple at `(7, 7)`.\n\n    *   **RIGHT to `(8, 5)`:**\n        *   **Safety:** Currently empty.\n        *   **Strategy:** This moves towards the apple at `(9, 4)`.\n        *   **Path Analysis:** `(8, 5)` -> `(9, 5)` -> `(9, 4)` is a clear path. The enemy is at `(9, 7)` and its body is mostly above `y=7` or at `x=6, 7` at `y=8`. The cell `(9, 6)` is currently empty. The cell `(9, 5)` is empty. This path seems safer than the `x=7` column which is getting crowded.\n        *   **Long-term:** `(9, 4)` is an apple. Eating it opens up space and score. It also positions me to potentially access the `(5, 3)` apple or others.\n\n5.  **Decision Synthesis:**\n    *   Moving `UP` to `(7, 6)` is risky because the enemy is at `(9, 7)` and can easily contest the `(7, 7)` area. I could get blocked or killed.\n    *   Moving `RIGHT` to `(8, 5)` secures a safe step towards the `(9, 4)` apple. The path `(9, 5) -> (9, 4)` is currently clear of enemy bodies. The enemy is focused on `x=9` at high Y, so `x=9` at Y=5 is likely safe for the next 2 turns. This is a \"flanking\" maneuver to grab an apple while the enemy is distracted on the far side of the board.\n    *   I will move `RIGHT` to start securing the `(9, 4)` apple.\n\n**Decision:** Move RIGHT to `(8, 5)`.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

There are no apples listed at `(9, 4)`. There is an apple at `(5, 3)`. The enemy snake `#0` is at `(6, 7)`.\n\nLet me re-evaluate the board state provided in the prompt to ensure I am aligned with the current turn.\nBoard state row 4: `. . . . . . . . . 1`. This indicates my head is at `(9, 4)`. Correct.\nBoard state row 5: `. . . A A . . . T T T`. This indicates the previous head position `(9, 5)` is now a tail part `T`.

This indicates an apple at `(5, 3)`.\nBoard state row 0: `. . . . . . A . . . .`. This indicates an apple at `(6, 0)`.\n\nThere is no apple at `(9, 4)`. The prompt text says \"There is an apple at `(9, 4)`\" in the \"Last Rationale\", but that was for turn 21. On turn 22, that apple has been eaten (otherwise my head would not be at `(9, 4)` and the tail would not have moved to `(8, 5)`).\nThe prompt explicitly lists the current apples at: `(3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 3), (4, 8), (6, 0)`.\nMy score is 3. Snake #0 has 7 apples.\n\nI need to choose a move for turn 22.\nCurrent position: `(9, 4)`.\nBody: `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`.\nNext body positions (if I move): The tail `(7, 5)` will move to `(8, 5)`, and `(8, 5)` will move to `(9, 5)`. The current head `(9, 4)` will become the new neck. So my body will effectively be `[(9, 5), (8, 5)]` relative to my new head position.\n\nAvailable moves:\n1.  **UP**: To `(9, 5)`. This is currently occupied by my own body (the segment that was my head last turn). **DEAD**.\n2.  **DOWN**: To `(9, 3)`. Is this safe?\n    *   Inside board? Yes.\n    *   Hits my body? My body is `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`. `(9, 3)` is clear.\n    *   Hits enemy body? Enemy is at `y=7` and above. Clear.\n    *   Head-on collision? Enemy is at `(6, 7)`. To hit me at `(9, 3)`, they would need to move 3 right and 4 down. Max speed is 1. Safe.\n    *   Is it a trap? `(9, 3)` is a corner. Down from there is `(9, 2)` -> `(9, 1)` -> `(9, 0)` (dead end). Left from `(9, 3)` is `(8, 3)`.\n    *   There is an apple at `(6, 0)`. From `(9, 3)`, I would have to go LEFT/LEFT/LEFT/DOWN/DOWN/DOWN to reach it. That path is `[(8,3), (7,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0)]`. This is a long path, and I would be stuck in the bottom right corner.\n    *   There is an apple at `(5, 3)`. From `(9, 3)`, go LEFT/LEFT/LEFT/LEFT to `(5, 3)`. Path: `[(8,3), (7,3), (6,3), (5,3)]`. Also potential collision with the wall at `(5,3)` if I need to turn around later.\n3.  **LEFT**: To `(8, 4)`.\n    *   Inside board? Yes.\n    *   Hits my body? My body is `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`. `(8, 4)` is clear.\n    *   Hits enemy body? Clear.\n    *   Head-on collision? Clear.\n    *   Openness? From `(8, 4)`, I can go UP to `(8, 5)`, DOWN to `(8, 3)`, LEFT to `(7, 4)`.\n    *   `UP` to `(8, 5)`: This will be occupied by my body (the segment moving from `(9, 5)` to `(8, 5)`). So `UP` will be blocked next turn if I move LEFT now. (Wait, if I move LEFT to `(8, 4)`, my body moves: `(9, 5)` -> `(8, 5)`, `(8, 5)` -> `(7, 5)`. Yes, `(8, 5)` will be occupied).\n    *   `DOWN` to `(8, 3)`: Safe.\n    *   `LEFT` to `(7, 4)`: Safe.\n    *   So I have 2 options next turn (DOWN, LEFT). This is better than the corner.\n4.  **RIGHT**: To `(10, 4)`. Off board. **DEAD**.\n\nComparison of **DOWN** vs **LEFT**:\n*   **DOWN** puts me in the corner `(9, 3)`. It opens a path to `(5, 3)` (Apple) and `(6, 0)` (Apple), but forces me to traverse the bottom edge. Enemy #0 is at `(6, 7)`, so they might be hunting the apples near the center/top. If I go down, I am moving away from the enemy and the center.\n*   **LEFT** moves towards the center of the board `(8, 4)`. It keeps my options open. From `(8, 4)`, I can access the left side of the board.\n    *   Is there an apple near me? The apples are at `(3,5), (4,5), (5,3), (4,8), (6,0)`.\n    *   From `(8, 4)`, the apple at `(5, 3)` is reachable via `LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, DOWN`.\n    *   From `(8, 4)`, the apple at `(6, 0)` is reachable via `LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT`.\n    *   From `(8, 4)`, I am closer to `(4, 8)` than I was at `(9, 4)`? `(9, 4)` to `(4, 8)` is 5 left, 4 up. `(8, 4)` to `(4, 8)` is 4 left, 4 up.\n    *   The most valuable apple is likely `(3, 5)` or `(4, 5)`. `(4, 5)` is very close to the enemy's current position `(6, 7)`.\n    *   The apple at `(5, 3)` is isolated. It might be safer.\n    *   The apple at `(6, 0)` is also isolated.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 5: `. . . A A . . . T T T`. Apples at `(3, 5)` and `(4, 5)`.\nMy head is at `(9, 4)`.\nIf I go **LEFT**, I am at `(8, 4)`. Next I can go **UP**? No, blocked. **DOWN**? Yes. **LEFT**? Yes.\nIf I go **LEFT** to `(8, 4)`, and then **LEFT** to `(7, 4)`, I am getting closer to the center.\nThe path to `(5, 3)` is `(7, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (5, 3)`.\nThe path to `(3, 5)` is `(7, 4) -> (7, 5) -> ... wait, `(7, 5)` is my tail. When I move from `(8, 4)` to `(7, 4)`, my tail `(7, 5)` moves to `(8, 5)`? No.\nLet's trace the tail movement carefully.\nCurrent: Head `(9, 4)`, Body `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`.\nMove LEFT: New Head `(8, 4)`.\nNew Body: `[(9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5)]`. Tail `(7, 5)` is removed (unless I eat an apple, which I don't see at `(8, 4)`).\nWait, if I move LEFT, the cell `(7, 5)` becomes empty.\nSo next turn, from `(8, 4)`, I can go UP to `(8, 5)`. Is `(8, 5)` free?\n`(8, 5)` is currently my body. But the body moves.\nCurrent body: `[ (9, 4) (head), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5) ]`.\nMove LEFT: Head moves to `(8, 4)`.\nNew body: `[ (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5) ]`.\nWait, the rule is \"snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head\".\nCurrent: Head `(9, 4)`, Body `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`.\nIf I move LEFT, Head becomes `(8, 4)`.\nThe body becomes `[ (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5) ]`.\nSo the cell `(8, 5)` is still occupied by my body next turn.\nTherefore, if I am at `(8, 4)` and try to go UP to `(8, 5)`, I will hit my own body.\nSo from `(8, 4)`, my available moves are:\n- UP: To `(8, 5)` (Body). Blocked.\n- DOWN: To `(8, 3)` (Empty). Allowed.\n- LEFT: To `(7, 4)` (Empty). Allowed.\n- RIGHT: To `(9, 4)` (Body). Blocked.\n\nSo `LEFT` gives me 2 options: `DOWN` and `LEFT`.\n`DOWN` (to corner `(9, 3)`) gives me 2 options: `LEFT` (to `(8, 3)`) and `DOWN` (to `(9, 2)`).\nActually, let's check `DOWN` move again.\nHead `(9, 4)` -> `(9, 3)`.\nNew Body: `[ (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5) ]` (Tail `(7, 5)` dropped).\nFrom `(9, 3)`:\n- UP: `(9, 4)` (Body). Blocked.\n- LEFT: `(8, 3)` (Empty). Allowed.\n- DOWN: `(9, 2)` (Empty). Allowed.\n- RIGHT: `(10, 3)` (Wall). Blocked.\nSo `DOWN` move also leaves me with 2 options: `LEFT` and `DOWN`.\n\nSo both `LEFT` and `DOWN` give me 2 safe options for the next turn. Both move me away from the wall eventually.\nHowever, `LEFT` moves me towards the center of the board, which is generally better for intercepting apples and staying flexible. `DOWN` moves me into a corner area where movement is restricted to the bottom row (if I go DOWN again) or the row above (if I go LEFT).\nAlso, `LEFT` opens the possibility of reaching `(5, 3)` or `(3, 5)`.\n`DOWN` opens the possibility of reaching `(6, 0)` or `(5, 3)`.\nThe apple at `(3, 5)` is in the top-left quadrant. The apple at `(4, 5)` is there too. The apple at `(4, 8)` is top-left. The apple at `(5, 3)` is bottom-left. The apple at `(6, 0)` is bottom-left.\nThe enemy snake is at `(6, 7)`, which is center-top. They are likely guarding the apples at `(4, 5)` and `(3, 5)` and `(4, 8)`.\nI am at `(9, 4)`. I am far away.\nIf I go `DOWN`, I am going to the bottom edge. If I go `LEFT`, I am entering the board from the right side.\nThe apple at `(5, 3)` is somewhat accessible from either direction.\nIf I go `LEFT`, I can potentially loop around to get the apples at `(3, 5)` or `(4, 5)` by going up the left side.\nIf I go `DOWN`, I will be stuck on the bottom row for a while, and the apples on the bottom are `(5, 3)` and `(6, 0)`.\n`(5, 3)` is \"safest\" because it's a corner apple (relative to the bottom left area) and might not be contested immediately by the enemy who is at `y=7`.\n`(6, 0)` is also safe but harder to reach if I have to turn around.\nLet's consider the \"Backwards\" rule. I came from `(9, 5)`. So `(9, 5)` is backwards.\nIf I move `DOWN` to `(9, 3)`, I am not moving backwards.\nIf I move `LEFT` to `(8, 4)`, I am not moving backwards.\n\nIs there any immediate threat? No. The enemy is far.\n\nLet's reconsider `LEFT`. It moves to `(8, 4)`. It avoids the corner. It opens up the board.\nLet's reconsider `DOWN`. It moves to `(9, 3)`. It enters the corner. It restricts movement to the bottom.\nUsually, avoiding corners is better unless there is a specific apple in the corner.\nThe apples are `(5, 3)` and `(6, 0)` on the bottom. `(5, 3)` is easier to reach from `(8, 4)` (LEFT -> LEFT -> LEFT -> DOWN) than from `(9, 3)` (LEFT -> LEFT -> LEFT -> LEFT -> DOWN -> DOWN).\nFrom `(9, 3)`, to get to `(5, 3)`, I need to go 4 LEFT and 1 DOWN (actually I'm at y=3, so 4 LEFT).\nFrom `(8, 4)`, to get to `(5, 3)`, I need to go 3 LEFT and 1 DOWN.\nSo `LEFT` is strictly better for reaching `(5, 3)`.\nWhat about `(6, 0)`?\nFrom `(9, 3)`: 3 LEFT, 3 DOWN.\nFrom `(8, 4)`: 2 LEFT, 4 DOWN.\nAlso `LEFT` is better.\n\nSo `LEFT` is better for approaching all bottom-row apples.\nWhat about the top apples? `(3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 8)`.\n`(4, 8)` is at `(4, 8)`.\nFrom `(9, 3)`: 5 LEFT, 5 UP.\nFrom `(8, 4)`: 4 LEFT, 4 UP.\n`LEFT` is better.\n\nTherefore, `LEFT` is strictly better than `DOWN`.\n\nCould I be trapped by the enemy?\nThe enemy is at `(6, 7)`. The enemy is quite large (8 segments). However, they are in the center/top.\nIf I go `LEFT`, I am moving away from them initially.\nIf I go `DOWN`, I am also moving away from them.\nThe board has walls on all sides.\n\nOne detail: The prompt says \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself\".\nMy previous move was DOWN (from `(9, 5)` to `(9, 4)`). So backwards is UP.\nMy allowed moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (RIGHT is wall). So I'm safe.\n\nLet's double check the board state for hidden dangers.\nRow 4: `. . . . . . . . . 1`. Correct.\nRow 5: `. . . A A . . . T T T`. The `T` at `(7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5)`. Wait, the prompt says my body is `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`.\nThere is a potential confusion in the prompt's \"My snake (ID: 1)\" section vs the \"Board state\".\n\"My snake (ID: 1): ... Body: [(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]\".\n\"Board state\": Row 5 has `T` at `(7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5)`.\n\"Board state\": Row 4 has `1` at `(9, 4)`.\nSo the board state matches the snake description (Head at 9,4, Tail parts at 9,5, 8,5, 7,5).\nThe prompt text says \"Apples at: (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 3), (4, 8), (6, 0)\".\nI should trust the \"Apples at\" list and the coordinates.\n\nThe enemy snake #0 is described as:\nHead: `(6, 7)`.\nBody: `[(7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9)]`.\nBoard state check:\nRow 9: `T T T . . . . . . .`? No, prompt says: `9 . . . . . . . T T T`.\nWait, the enemy body is `(9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9)`.\nRow 7: `. . . . . . 0 T T T`. `(7, 7)` is Head `0`. `(8, 7)`, `(9, 7)` are `T`. Correct.\nRow 8: `. . . . A . . . . T`. `(9, 8)` is `T`. Correct.\nRow 9: `. . . . . . . T T T`. `(7, 9)`, `(8, 9)`, `(9, 9)` are `T`. Correct.\n\nSo the board state matches the snake info. Good.\n\nSummary:\n- Current position: `(9, 4)`.\n- Moves: UP (Blocked), DOWN (Safe but Corner), LEFT (Safe, Open), RIGHT (Wall).\n- `LEFT` is the best move to stay open and approach apples.\n\nWait, let me check the apple at `(6, 0)` again.\nIf I go `LEFT` to `(8, 4)`, I am at `x=8, y=4`.\nTo get to `(6, 0)`, I need to go 2 left (to `x=6`) and 4 down (to `y=0`).\nPath: `(7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0)`.\nIs there an obstacle?\nRow 4: `(6, 4)` is empty.\nRow 3: `(6, 3)` is empty (Apple is at `5, 3`).\nRow 2: `(6, 2)` is empty.\nRow 1: `(6, 1)` is empty.\nRow 0: `(6, 0)` is Apple.\nThis path seems clear.\nThe enemy is at `(6, 7)`. To reach `(6, 0)`, the enemy would have to move down 7 steps. That's a long way.\nHowever, the enemy has 7 apples. I have 3. The enemy might be hunting the apples near the center or top.\nThe apples at `(3, 5)`, `(4, 5)`, `(4, 8)` are top-left. The enemy is at `(6, 7)` (top-center).\nThe apples at `(5, 3)`, `(6, 0)` are bottom-left.\nI am at `(9, 4)` (right-center).\nI am best positioned for the bottom-left apples.\nThe enemy is best positioned for the top-left apples.\nI should prioritize `(5, 3)` and `(6, 0)`.\n`LEFT` move helps with both.\n`DOWN` move helps with both but restricts me.\n\nWait, is there any apple I missed?\nApples: `(3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 3), (4, 8), (6, 0)`.\nCorrect.\n\nIs there any apple near me? No.\nMy previous move was DOWN. I ate something? No, my score is 3.\nThe last rationale said I was moving to `(9, 4)` to eat an apple. But the current turn info says apples are at the list above.\nThe board state shows row 4 has `1` at `(9, 4)` and no `A`. Row 5 has `T` at `(9, 5)`.\nSo the previous move was just a move, not an apple collection (or the apple was at `(9, 4)` and the list provided for *this* turn is updated).\nWait, the prompt says \"Apples at: ...\".\nIf there was an apple at `(9, 4)`, I would have eaten it. My score is still 3. So either I didn't eat it (moved there and it wasn't an apple) or the list is for the current state.\nGiven I am at `(9, 4)` and score is 3, and I was at `(9, 5)` (score 3), I did not grow. So there was no apple at `(9, 4)` to eat this turn.\nActually, wait. \"Turn: 22 / 150\".\n\"Your last move information\" -> \"DOWN\".\n\"Last Rationale\" -> \"Moving DOWN will eat the apple\".\nIf I moved DOWN and ate an apple, my score would be 4 and I would have grown (tail stays at `(8, 5)`).\nMy current body is `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`. Length is 4 (Head + 3 Body).\nIf I ate an apple, the tail `(7, 5)` would NOT be removed. The body would be `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 5)]`? No, the tail stays where it was. The body extends.\nSo if I ate an apple at `(9, 4)`, my body would be `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 5)]`? No, the tail is the last element.\nCurrent state (Turn 22 start): Head `(9, 4)`, Body `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`. Length 4.\nThis implies I did NOT eat an apple on the previous turn (Turn 21).\nWait, if I ate an apple, the tail stays. So the body would be longer.\nLet's re-read the prompt carefully.\n\"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (9, 4), Body: [(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]\".\nThis means the snake has 4 segments.\nThe \"Last Rationale\" says \"Moving DOWN will eat the apple\".\nIf the rationale was correct and I moved DOWN to `(9, 4)` and ate an apple, the tail `(7, 5)` would NOT be removed.\nSo my body at the start of this turn (Turn 22) would be `[(9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`.\nBut the prompt says \"Body: [(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]\".\nThis is inconsistent.\nPossibility 1: The prompt's \"My snake\" section lists the body *excluding* the head, and *assuming* I did NOT eat an apple.\nPossibility 2: The prompt's \"My snake\" section lists the body *excluding* the head, but the length is wrong.\nPossibility 3: The \"Last Rationale\" was a hallucination or I didn't actually eat the apple (maybe it wasn't there).\nPossibility 4: The board state in the prompt is the state *after* my move, but the \"My snake\" section text is static.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nRow 4: `. . . . . . . . . 1`.\nIf I moved DOWN from `(9, 5)` to `(9, 4)`, and ate an apple, the tail `(7, 5)` would remain.\nIf I moved DOWN and did NOT eat an apple, the tail `(7, 5)` would move to `(8, 5)`.\nIf I moved DOWN and ate an apple, the tail `(7, 5)` would stay at `(7, 5)`.\nSo if I ate an apple, my body would be `(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 5)`? No, the tail stays fixed. The body grows.\nHead: `(9, 4)`.\nBody: `(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 5)`? No.\nIf I am at `(9, 4)` (Head) and I ate an apple, the tail from the PREVIOUS turn (which was at `(8, 5)`) would NOT move. So the body would be `(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 5)`? No.\nLet's trace a snake of length 4 eating an apple.\nPrev Head: `(9, 5)`. Prev Body: `[(8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5)]`. Tail `(6, 5)`.\nMove DOWN to `(9, 4)`. Eat Apple.\nNew Head: `(9, 4)`.\nNew Body: `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5)]`. The tail `(6, 5)` is NOT removed.\nSo length becomes 5.\nBut the prompt says my body is `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`. This is 3 segments. Total 4.\nIf I ate an apple, total would be 5.\nSo I did NOT eat an apple.\nThe \"Last Rationale\" claiming I would eat an apple was incorrect, or there was no apple at `(9, 4)`.\nThe \"Apples at\" list for Turn 22 does NOT include `(9, 4)`.\nSo I definitely did NOT eat an apple.\nTherefore, the tail `(7, 5)` moved. Wait.\nIf I didn't eat an apple, the tail moves forward.\nIf my body was `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]` before the move (Head at `(9, 5)`).\nWait, the prompt says \"Your last move information\" ... \"DOWN\".\nAnd \"Head: (9, 4)\".\nSo I moved from `(9, 5)` to `(9, 4)`.\nIf I did not eat an apple:\nNew Head: `(9, 4)`.\nNew Body: `[(9, 5), (8, 5)]`. The tail `(7, 5)` moves to `(8, 5)`.\nBut the prompt says \"Body: [(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]\".\nThis is the only inconsistency.\nThe board state shows `T` at `(7, 5)`, `(8, 5)`, `(9, 5)`.\nThis implies the tail is still at `(7, 5)`.\nIf the tail is at `(7, 5)`, then I must have eaten an apple.\nIf I ate an apple, my score should be 4.\nPrompt says \"Apples collected: 3\".\nOkay, I must trust the \"Apples collected\" and the \"Body\" list provided in the text description over the board state drawing or the \"Last Rationale\".\nIf I have 3 apples and Body `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`, and Head `(9, 4)`, this means:\nI moved DOWN. I did NOT eat an apple. Therefore the tail `(7, 5)` moved to `(8, 5)`.\nWait. If the tail moved from `(7, 5)` to `(8, 5)`, then the body should be `[(9, 5), (8, 5)]`.\nWhy does the prompt say `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`?\nMaybe the prompt lists the history of the body segments? No, \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one, and the last tuple is the tail.\"\nSo the list provided IS the body.\nMaybe I am reading the turn number wrong.\n\"Turn: 22 / 150\".\nThis is the input for Turn 22. The state describes the snake *after* Turn 21's move.\nSo I am at `(9, 4)`.\nIf the body is `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`, then the length is 4 (Head + 3 Body).\nIf I ate an apple on Turn 21, length would be 5.\nSince length is 4, I did not eat an apple.\nIf I did not eat an apple, the tail moves.\nIf the tail was at `(8, 5)` before the move, it would move to `(9, 5)`.\nIf the tail was at `(7, 5)` before the move, it would move to `(8, 5)`.\nThe body provided is `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`.\nThis implies the tail is at `(7, 5)`.\nThis implies the segment before `(7, 5)` was at `(8, 5)`.\nThis implies the segment before that was at `(9, 5)`.\nThis implies I did NOT move? No, I moved DOWN from `(9, 5)`.\nIf I moved DOWN from `(9, 5)` to `(9, 4)`:\nThe old head `(9, 5)` becomes the new neck.\nThe old neck `(8, 5)` becomes the next body part.\nThe old body `(7, 5)` becomes the tail *if I grew*.\nIf I *didn't* grow, the tail `(7, 5)` would be removed.\nSo if I didn't grow, the body would be `[(9, 5), (8, 5)]`.\nBut the prompt says `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`.\nThis implies I DID grow (ate an apple), but the score wasn't updated in the text \"Apples collected: 3\", OR the body list is static/hallucinated.\nOR, the head was at `(9, 5)` and I moved UP to `(9, 6)`? No, \"Last move: DOWN\".\nOR, the head was at `(9, 3)` and I moved UP to `(9, 4)`?\n\"Head: (9, 4)\".\n\"Last move: DOWN\".\n\"Previous Head: (9, 5)\".\nOkay, there is a clear contradiction in the prompt data regarding the tail.\n1. If I ate an apple (score 3 -> 4), tail stays. Body: `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 5)]`? No.\n   Body: `[(9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`. (Length 4? No, Length 4 means 1 head + 3 body).\n   If I ate an apple, length increases. So if I had length 3 before, I have length 4 now.\n   If I had length 3 before: `Head (9, 5)`, Body `[(8, 5), (7, 5)]`.\n   Move DOWN to `(9, 4)`. Eat Apple.\n   New Head `(9, 4)`. New Body `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`. Length 4.\n   This matches the prompt \"Apples collected: 3\" (so I ate one now? No, 3 apples total. If I ate one now, it would be 4).\n   \"Apples collected: 3\" means I have 3 total.\n   If I ate one on this turn, I'd have 4. So I did NOT eat one.\n   \n   Let's assume the prompt's \"Body: ...\" list is correct and \"Apples: 3\" is correct.\n   This means I moved DOWN but did NOT eat an apple.\n   Therefore, the tail `(7, 5)` (from the previous body `[(8, 5), (7, 5)]`) moves to `(8, 5)`.\n   So the new body is `[(9, 5), (8, 5)]`.\n   Why does the prompt say `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`?\n   Maybe the previous turn I had length 4? No, apples 3.\n   Maybe the prompt's body list includes the tail that *would* be there if I hadn't moved? No.\n   \n   Let's ignore the tail inconsistency and look at the Board State provided.\n   Row 5: `. . . A A . . . T T T`.\n   The `T`'s are at `(7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5)`.\n   The `A`'s are at `(3, 5), (4, 5)`.\n   This board state is the visual truth.\n   If `(7, 5)` is a `T` (Tail), then my tail is at `(7, 5)`.\n   If my head is at `(9, 4)` and tail is at `(7, 5)`, then I must have grown on the last turn.\n   If I grew, my score should be 4.\n   The prompt says \"Apples collected: 3\".\n   \n   There is a conflict between the \"Score\" line and the \"Board State\".\n   Given this is a test, the Board State is usually the ground truth for positions.\n   The Score might be a typo or \"Apples collected\" refers to apples collected *before* this turn? No, usually it's total.\n   \n   Let's assume the Board State is correct.\n   Head `(9, 4)`. Body parts `(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)`.\n   This is a snake of length 4.\n   I just moved DOWN from `(9, 5)`.\n   To have a tail at `(7, 5)`, I must have grown.\n   So I should have 4 apples.\n   If the prompt says 3, I will trust the Board State for safety checks (Don't hit the tail at `(7, 5)`).\n   \n   However, if I *did* grow, the tail `(7, 5)` stays there.\n   If I *did not* grow, the tail moves to `(8, 5)`.\n   \n   Let's look at the \"Last Move Rationale\". It says \"Moving DOWN will eat the apple\".\n   It also says \"My snake (ID 1) apples: 3\". (This is in the \"Scores so far\" section).\n   Wait, \"Scores so far\" -> \"Your snake (ID 1) apples: 3\".\n   \"My snake (ID: 1)\" section -> \"Apples collected: 3\".\n   \n   Okay, let's assume the \"Last Rationale\" is just the *plan* I made, not necessarily what happened.\n   If I moved DOWN and there was NO apple, my tail moves.\n   If my body was `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]` (length 4 total), then I started with length 4.\n   Wait, if I have 3 apples, I can't have length 4. I start at length 3. I need 3 apples to be length 4.\n   So if I have 3 apples, my length is 4.\n   If my length is 4, my body is `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`? No, that's 3 segments.\n   Head + 3 Body = Length 4.\n   So `Head (9, 5)` + `Body [(8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5)]`.\n   \n   Let's look at the Board State Row 5 again: `. . . A A . . . T T T`.\n   The `T`s are at `(7,5), (8,5), (9,5)`.\n   This implies the tail is at `(7, 5)`. The head was at `(9, 5)`.\n   So the body was `(8, 5), (7, 5)`.\n   Total length: Head + 2 Body = 3.\n   If I had length 3 and 3 apples, that means I started at length 3? No, you start at length 3.\n   If I have 3 apples, length is 6. Wait, no.\n   \"If you move onto an apple... you grow by 1 segment\".\n   Start Length = 3.\n   1 Apple -> Length 4.\n   2 Apples -> Length 5.\n   3 Apples -> Length 6.\n   \n   Okay, let's re-read the rules.\n   \"If you move onto an apple... you grow by 1 segment\".\n   \"All snakes move simultaneously...\". \"If you move onto an apple... you grow\".\n   Usually in Snake, length = 3 + apples eaten.\n   \n   So if \"Apples: 3\", Length should be 6.\n   My body description `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]` is only 3 segments.\n   Total: Head `(9, 4)` + 3 Body = Length 4.\n   \n   There is a massive inconsistency in the prompt data.\n   - \"Apples: 3\" vs \"Body length 3\" (implied).\n   - \"Board State\" `T` at `(7,5), (8,5), (9,5)`.\n   \n   Let's assume the Board State is correct. It shows `T` at `(7,5), (8,5), (9,5)`.\n   This means the tail is at `(7, 5)`.\n   This means the snake segments are `(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)`.\n   This is length 3.\n   If length is 3, I have 0 apples.\n   But the prompt says 3 apples.\n   \n   Maybe the prompt uses \"Apples: 3\" to mean \"Points: 3\"? Yes, usually.\n   Maybe the snake body description in text is wrong.\n   \n   Let's assume the Board State is the most reliable source for geometry.\n   And let's assume the \"Apples: 3\" is correct.\n   So Length = 3 + 3 = 6.\n   Where are the other 3 segments?\n   The Board State shows `T` at `(7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5)`.\n   Maybe the snake is winding?\n   Row 5: `. . . A A . . . T T T`.\n   The `T`s are at the end.\n   The head is at `(9, 4)`.\n   So the body goes: `(9, 4) -> (9, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (7, 5) -> ...`\n   The `T` indicates the tail. So `(7, 5)` is the tail.\n   This means the segments are just `(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)`.\n   So the length is 4 (Head + 3).\n   \n   If the length is 4, I must have eaten 1 apple (Start 3 + 1 = 4).\n   But \"Apples: 3\".\n   \n   Okay, I have to make a decision. I will trust the Board State for collision detection.\n   Board State shows `T` at `(7,5), (8,5), (9,5)`.\n   And `1` at `(9, 4)`.\n   So my body is `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`.\n   \n   If I move `LEFT` to `(8, 4)`:\n   My new body will be `[(9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5)]` (assuming I didn't grow).\n   The tail `(7, 5)` will disappear.\n   So `(8, 5)` will be occupied.\n   \n   If I move `DOWN` to `(9, 3)`:\n   My new body will be `[(9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5)]`.\n   `(7, 5)` disappears.\n   \n   If the Board State `T` at `(7, 5)` is correct, then `(7, 5)` is the tail.\n   If I don't eat an apple, the tail disappears.\n   \n   Wait, if I have 3 apples (length 6), and the board shows `T` at `(7, 5)`, then the snake must be:\n   Head `(9, 4)`.\n   `(9, 5)`.\n   `(8, 5)`.\n   `(7, 5)`.\n   `(6, 5)`.\n   `(5, 5)`.\n   But the board shows `.` at `(6, 5)` and `(5, 5)` (Row 5: `. . . A A ...`).\n   \n   So the snake is NOT length 6.\n   The snake is length 4.\n   So \"Apples: 3\" in the score text is likely a typo for \"Apples: 1\".\n   \n   OR, \"Apples: 3\" refers to \"Apples Eaten This Game\".\n   And the snake has grown 3 times.\n   Start length 3.\n   Ate 1: Length 4.\n   Ate 2: Length 5.\n   Ate 3: Length 6.\n   Still doesn't match the board.\n   \n   Let's look at the Enemy Snake #0.\n   \"Snake #0 - Head: (6, 7), Body: [(7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9)], Apples: 7\".\n   Length = 1 Head + 7 Body = 8.\n   Apples = 7.\n   Start length 3. + 7 apples = Length 10.\n   Enemy has 7 apples, so length should be 10. Provided body has 8 segments. Length 8.\n   So Enemy is length 8. Apples 7.\n   \n   My snake: Apples 3. Length should be 6. Provided body has 3 segments (implied by `T` locations and list). Length 4.\n   \n   There is a pattern. Enemy length (8) is close to apples (7) + 1 or 2.\n   My length (4) is close to apples (3) + 1.\n   \n   Maybe the board state visual is just showing the tail parts?\n   No, the rules say \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail\".\n   And the board visualization usually shows the whole snake.\n   \n   Let's assume the prompt's \"Body: ...\" list is the truth for *my* snake.\n   \"Body: [(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]\".\n   This is 3 segments.\n   \"Apples: 3\".\n   Maybe I start with length 1?

T T T`. `(7,9), (8,9), (9,9)` are body.\n   So Snake #0 body: `(7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9)`.\n   Length = 7 body + 1 head = 8.\n   \n   If Snake #0 has 7 apples, and starts at length 3, it should be length 10.\n   If it has length 8, it has eaten 5 apples.\n   \n   So BOTH snakes' \"Apples\" count seems to be 2 more than their length (minus start length)? No.\n   My Length 4. Apples 3. (Start 3 + 1 = 4).\n   Enemy Length 8. Apples 7. (Start 3 + 5 = 8).\n   \n   Okay, the \"Apples\" count in the text matches \"Length - Start Length\".\n   My Apples = 3. Length = 4. (Start 3 + 3? No).\n   \n   Let's step back. I need to make a move.\n   I am at `(9, 4)`.\n   My body is `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`.\n   The board state shows `T` at `(7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5)`.\n   This confirms the geometry.\n   Even if the counts are off, the geometry is what matters for collision.\n   \n   So, I am at `(9, 4)`.\n   Moves:\n   UP: `(9, 5)`. Occupied by my body. **DEAD**.\n   DOWN: `(9, 3)`. Safe.\n   LEFT: `(8, 4)`. Safe.\n   RIGHT: `(10, 4)`. Wall. **DEAD**.\n   \n   Options: DOWN or LEFT.\n   \n   If I move LEFT to `(8, 4)`:\n   New Head `(8, 4)`.\n   New Body `[(9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5)]`.\n   Tail `(7, 5)` removed.\n   Next turn options:\n   From `(8, 4)`:\n   UP: `(8, 5)` (Occupied by body). Blocked.\n   DOWN: `(8, 3)` (Safe).\n   LEFT: `(7, 4)` (Safe).\n   RIGHT: `(9, 4)` (Occupied by body). Blocked.\n   So 2 options.\n   \n   If I move DOWN to `(9, 3)`:\n   New Head `(9, 3)`.\n   New Body `[(9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5)]`.\n   Tail `(7, 5)` removed.\n   From `(9, 3)`:\n   UP: `(9, 4)` (Occupied). Blocked.\n   LEFT: `(8, 3)` (Safe).\n   DOWN: `(9, 2)` (Safe).\n   RIGHT: `(10, 3)` (Wall). Blocked.\n   So 2 options.\n   \n   Both moves leave me with 2 options next turn.\n   `LEFT` moves me to `(8, 4)`.\n   `DOWN` moves me to `(9, 3)`.\n   \n   Which is better?\n   `(8, 4)` is closer to the center `(5, 3), (3, 5)` etc.\n   `(9, 3)` is further right.\n   \n   There is an apple at `(6, 0)`.\n   From `(8, 4)`: `(7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0)`.\n   From `(9, 3)`: `(8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0)`.\n   Distance from `(8, 4)` is 6 moves.\n   Distance from `(9, 3)` is 6 moves.\n   \n   There is an apple at `(5, 3)`.\n   From `(8, 4)`: `(7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 3)`. Distance 4.\n   From `(9, 3)`: `(8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3)`. Distance 4.\n   \n   There is an apple at `(4, 5)`.\n   From `(8, 4)`: `(8, 5)`. But `(8, 5)` is my body next turn (if I went LEFT). So I can't go directly UP.\n   I would have to go `LEFT` to `(7, 4)`, then `UP` to `(7, 5)` (wait, `(7, 5)` is the OLD tail, which will be gone). No, `(7, 5)` is gone.\n   So from `(8, 4)` (after LEFT):\n   Go `(7, 4)` -> `(6, 4)` -> `(6, 5)` -> `(5, 5)` -> `(4, 5)`.\n   Or `(7, 4)` -> `(7, 5)` -> `(6, 5)` -> `(5, 5)` -> `(4, 5)`.\n   If I go `LEFT` to `(8, 4)`, my body will be `[(9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5)]`.\n   So `(8, 5)` is blocked. `(9, 4)` is blocked. `(9, 5)` is blocked.\n   I can go `(8, 4)` -> `(7, 4)` (Safe).\n   Then from `(7, 4)`:\n   `(7, 5)` is safe (OLD tail moved).\n   `(6, 4)` is safe.\n   So I can reach `(4, 5)` via `(7, 5)` -> `(6, 5)` -> `(5, 5)` -> `(4, 5)`.\n   Wait, `(5, 5)` is in row 5. Row 5 is `. . . A A ...`. So `(5, 5)` is empty. `(6, 5)` is empty.\n   So path is clear.\n   \n   From `(9, 3)` (after DOWN):\n   Body `[(9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5)]`.\n   I can go `(8, 3)`.\n   Then `(7, 3)`, `(6, 3)`, `(6, 4)`, `(6, 5)`, `(5, 5)`, `(4, 5)`.\n   Also clear.\n   \n   So both paths are open.\n   \n   However, `LEFT` puts me at `(8, 4)`.\n   The enemy is at `(6, 7)`.\n   The enemy has 7 apples. I have 3.\n   The enemy is winning. I need to catch up.\n   The apples at `(3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 8)` are top-left.\n   The enemy is at `(6, 7)` (top-center).\n   The apples at `(5, 3), (6, 0)` are bottom-left.\n   I am at `(9, 4)` (right-center).\n   \n   If I go `LEFT`, I am moving towards `(5, 3)` and `(6, 0)` (bottom) AND `(3, 5)` etc (top).\n   If I go `DOWN`, I am moving towards `(5, 3)` and `(6, 0)` (bottom).\n   I am cut off from the top apples by the enemy? Maybe not cut off, but the enemy is closer.\n   \n   The safest and most flexible move is `LEFT`. It avoids the corner.\n   Even if I can't get the top apples, `LEFT` keeps me mobile.\n   \n   Wait, is there any apple I can reach *safely*?\n   `(5, 3)` is \"safe\" in the sense that it's out of the way.\n   The enemy is at `(6, 7)`. To get to `(5, 3)`, the enemy would have to go 1 left, 4 down. That's 5 moves.\n   I am at `(9, 4)`. To get to `(5, 3)`, I need 4 left, 1 down (via `(8, 4)`) or 4 left, 1 down (via `(9, 3)`).\n   So I am 5 moves away. Enemy is 5 moves away.\n   It's a race.\n   If I go `LEFT` to `(8, 4)`, I am 4 moves away.\n   If I go `DOWN` to `(9, 3)`, I am 5 moves away.\n   So `LEFT` is better for `(5, 3)`.\n   \n   What about `(6, 0)`?\n   Enemy: `(6, 7)` -> `(6, 6)` -> `(6, 5)` -> `(6, 4)` -> `(6, 3)` -> `(6, 2)` -> `(6, 1)` -> `(6, 0)`. 7 moves.\n   Me (via LEFT): `(8, 4)` -> `(7, 4)` -> `(6, 4)` -> `(6, 3)` -> `(6, 2)` -> `(6, 1)` -> `(6, 0)`. 7 moves.\n   Me (via DOWN): `(9, 3)` -> `(8, 3)` -> `(7, 3)` -> `(6, 3)` -> `(6, 2)` -> `(6, 1)` -> `(6, 0)`. 7 moves.\n   Tie.\n   \n   Let's look at the board state one more time.\n   Row 8: `. . . . A . . . . T`.\n   Apple at `(4, 8)`.\n   Enemy at `(6, 7)`.\n   Me at `(9, 4)`.\n   If I want `(4, 8)`, I need to go UP/LEFT.\n   If I go `LEFT`, I am on track.\n   If I go `DOWN`, I am away.\n   \n   Conclusion: `LEFT` is better.\n   \n   One final check: Could the enemy move to `(8, 4)`?\n   Enemy is at `(6, 7)`. Distance to `(8, 4)` is 2 right, 3 down = 5 moves. Impossible this turn.\n   Could the enemy move to `(9, 3)`? No.\n   \n   Is there any apple at `(8, 4)`? No.\n   Is there any apple at `(9, 3)`? No.\n   \n   So `LEFT` is the safe, flexible move towards the center apples.\n   \n   Long-term plan:\n   Move LEFT towards the center. Aim for apple at `(5, 3)` or intercept enemy path to `(4, 5)` if possible, but prioritize survival. Enemy is at `(6, 7)` with 7 apples. I need to be careful. Avoid corners. Stay mobile.\n   \n   Wait, I should check if `DOWN` puts me in a corner that I can't escape.\n   From `(9, 3)`, I can go LEFT to `(8, 3)`. That's fine.\n   From `(9, 2)`, I can go LEFT to `(8, 2)`.\n   From `(9, 1)`, I can go LEFT to `(8, 1)`.\n   From `(9, 0)`, I can go LEFT to `(8, 0)`.\n   So `DOWN` doesn't trap me if I keep going LEFT.\n   But `LEFT` immediately gives me `(8, 4)`, which is \"more central\" than `(9, 3)`.\n   \n   Why do I like `(8, 4)`?\n   It allows me to reach `(4, 5)` without having to pass through `(9, 5)` or `(8, 5)`.\n   From `(8, 4)`, I can go `(7, 4) -> (7, 5) -> (6, 5) -> (5, 5) -> (4, 5)`.\n   From `(9, 3)`, I have to go `(8, 3) -> (7, 3) -> ...` which is slightly longer to get to `y=5`.\n   \n   Also, the apple at `(4, 8)` is top-left.\n   From `(8, 4)`: 4 left, 4 up.\n   From `(9, 3)`: 5 left, 5 up.\n   `LEFT` is better.\n   \n   Final check on \"Moving directly backwards\".\n   I came from `(9, 5)` (Head).\n   I am at `(9, 4)`.\n   Backwards is `(9, 5)`.\n   `LEFT` is not backwards.\n   `DOWN` is not backwards.\n   \n   I will choose `LEFT`.\n   \n   Plan: Move LEFT to (8,4). Target apple (5,3) or (4,5). Avoid collision with Enemy #0 (at 6,7). Keep options open.\n   \n   Move: LEFT.\n   \n   Wait, is there any apple at (4,5) or (3,5)?\n   Yes, Row 5 has `A` at `(3, 5), (4, 5)`.\n   The enemy is at `(6, 7)`.\n   If I go `LEFT`, I can race for `(4, 5)`.\n   Enemy might go for `(3, 5)` or `(4, 5)`.\n   If I go `LEFT`, I threaten `(4, 5)`.\n   If I go `DOWN`, I am ignoring `(4, 5)`.\n   \n   `LEFT` seems correct.\n   \n   One edge case: What if the enemy moves DOWN/LEFT to `(5, 6)` or `(5, 7)`?\n   They might try to block the path to `(4, 5)`.\n   If I am at `(8, 4)`, I am behind them.\n   If I am at `(9, 3)`, I am even further behind.\n   So `LEFT` is better to contest.\n   \n   What if the enemy moves to `(7, 7)`? No, they are at `(6, 7)`.\n   If they move LEFT to `(5, 7)`.\n   If I go LEFT to `(8, 4)`.\n   I am at `(8, 4)`.\n   They are at `(5, 7)`.\n   Distance to `(4, 5)`:\n   Me: `(8,4)->(7,4)->(7,5)->(6,5)->(5,5)->(4,5)` (5 moves).\n   Enemy: `(5,7)->(5,6)->(5,5)->(4,5)` (3 moves).\n   Enemy is much faster.\n   So I should probably not race for `(4, 5)` if enemy is close.\n   The enemy is at `(6, 7)`.\n   To get to `(5, 7)`, they move LEFT.\n   To get to `(5, 6)`, they move DOWN.\n   To get to `(5, 5)`, they move DOWN/LEFT or LEFT/DOWN.\n   \n   If I go `LEFT` to `(8, 4)`.\n   And Enemy goes `LEFT` to `(5, 7)`.\n   I should then pivot to `(5, 3)` or `(6, 0)`.\n   From `(8, 4)`, I can go DOWN/LEFT/LEFT/LEFT to `(5, 3)`.\n   From `(5, 7)`, Enemy would have to go 2 LEFT, 4 DOWN to `(5, 3)`. 6 moves.\n   I take 4 moves.\n   So if Enemy moves `LEFT`, I should hunt `(5, 3)`.\n   \n   If Enemy goes `DOWN` to `(6, 6)`.\n   They are closer to `(5, 3)`? `(6, 6)` to `(5, 3)` is 1 left, 3 down. 4 moves.\n   I am at `(8, 4)` to `(5, 3)` is 3 left, 1 down. 4 moves.\n   Tie.\n   But if I am at `(8, 4)`, I am safer.\n   \n   So `LEFT` allows me to adapt.\n   \n   Final decision: `LEFT`.\n   \n   Wait, one check on the \"Apples: 3\" vs length.\n   If I am length 4 (Head + 3 Body).\n   And Apples is 3.\n   Maybe I am playing a variant where length = 1 + apples? No.\n   Maybe the body list in the prompt is incomplete?\n   If the body is really `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5)]`, the board would show `T` at those spots?\n   Row 5: `. . . A A . . . T T T`.\n   It shows `T` only at the end.\n   So the body is exactly `[(9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`.\n   \n   If I have 3 apples and length 4, I started at length 1? No.\n   If I have 3 apples and length 4, I started at length 0? No.\n   \n   Let's assume the prompt has a typo in the \"Apples: 3\" field and it should be \"Apples: 1\".\n   Or \"Apples: 3\" is correct and I should ignore the visual length for strategy and just assume I am long.\n   But if I am long, my tail is much longer than `(7, 5)`.\n   The board shows `T` at `(7, 5)`. So that is definitely the tail.\n   \n   I will proceed with the geometry provided by the board state (Head at 9,4, Body ending at 7,5).\n   \n   Move: LEFT.\n   \n   Plan: Move LEFT to (8,4). Assess enemy move. If enemy contests top-left (4,5), go for bottom-left (5,3). Keep moving away from walls.\n   \n   LEFT\nLEFT",

Body: [(9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5)].\n*   **Apples:** (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 3), (4, 8), (6, 0).\n\n**Evaluation of Moves for ID 0:**\n1.  **UP:** Target (6, 7). This is my neck/body. **Result: Death.**\n2.  **DOWN:** Target (6, 5). Open space. Directly approaches the apple at (6, 0) and (5, 3).\n3.  **LEFT:** Target (5, 6). Open space. Moves toward the center/left side where apples at (4, 5) and (3, 5) are located.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Target (7, 6). Open space. However, it moves toward the enemy snake #1 and toward the board edge where my tail is currently clearing out.\n\n**Strategic Comparison:**\n*   Moving **LEFT** to (5, 6) is very strong. It positions me to take (4, 5) or (3, 5) while staying in the wide-open upper-left quadrant. It also maintains a safe distance from Snake #1.\n*   Moving **DOWN** to (6, 5) is also safe, but puts me closer to Snake #1's head at (8, 4). If both snakes move toward the center apples, a confrontation might occur. \n*   Snake #1 is currently near the bottom-right. They will likely try to head toward (5, 3) or (6, 0).\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **LEFT** to (5, 6) is the most flexible move. It avoids the congestion near Snake #1 and targets the high-value apple cluster at (4, 5) and (3, 5). It also moves away from my own body segments which are currently occupying the (7-9, 7-9) area.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure (4, 5) and (3, 5). Once those are collected, assess the position of Snake #1. If they have moved toward the bottom, I can pivot back to (4, 8) or move down to (5, 3). Keep the snake in the open left-hand side of the board to maximize maneuvering room.\n\nLEFT",

Note: My neck is at (6, 6), so I can't move RIGHT. UP is safe.\n2.  **DOWN:** Target (5, 5). Open space.

It places me adjacent to two apples: (4, 5) and (3, 5) next turn. It also keeps me flexible to move toward (5, 3).\n*   **LEFT** to (4, 6) is also safe and moves toward (4, 8) or (4, 5), but DOWN is more direct for the cluster.\n*   **UP** to (5, 7) is safe but moves away from the immediate apple cluster at y=5.\n*   **Snake #1** is at (7, 4). If they move LEFT to (6, 4), they are angling for (5, 3). If I move DOWN to (5, 5), I am well-positioned to cut them off from the upper apples or contest the lower ones safely.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove to (5, 5) to grab the (4, 5) and (3, 5) apples.

No, looking at the map, (7, 5) is `.` (Empty).\n    -   Is it safe? Yes, (7, 5) is empty.\n    -   **Pathing:** This is an excellent move. It moves away from the enemy at (5, 6) and opens up the path to the apples at (3, 5) and (4, 5). From (7, 5), I have access to (6, 5), (8, 5), and (7, 4) (though (7, 4) will be my tail). This maintains flexibility.\n\n2.  **LEFT (6, 4):**\n    -   Cell is empty. Safe.\n    -   **Pathing:** This moves towards the bottom-left apples (5, 3) and (6, 0). However, it keeps me on the bottom row (y=4) and brings me closer to the enemy's potential path if it moves down. It is a valid move but slightly more restrictive than UP because it boxes me in against the bottom wall a bit more.\n\n3.  **DOWN (7, 3):**\n    -   Cell is empty. Safe.\n    -   **Pathing:** Moves towards apple (5, 3). However, it corners me at (7, 3) with the wall at y=0. From (7, 3), my only safe move might be LEFT (to (6, 3)), potentially leading to a dead end. It restricts future options significantly.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 4):**\n    -   Cell contains my body segment (8, 4). Moving here causes a collision with myself.\n    -   **Result:** Death. Eliminated.\n\n**Comparison:**\n-   **UP** provides the best board control, keeping me centrally located relative to the apples at (3, 5) and (4, 5) while avoiding walls.\n-   **LEFT** is a safe alternative but pushes me toward the wall.\n-   **DOWN** traps me in the corner.\n-   **RIGHT** kills me.\n\nI will choose **UP**.

          "rationale": "Based on the provided board state and rules, here is the analysis for the current turn:\n\n**1. Current Situation Analysis:**\n- **My Snake (ID 1):** Head at `(7, 5)`, Body `[(7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4)]`. Apples: 3.\n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at `(5, 5)`, Body extending to `(9, 8)`. Apples: 7.\n- **Apples:** Key targets are `(3, 5)`, `(4, 5)` to the left, and `(5, 3)` below.\n- **Move History:** Last move was `UP` (from `(7, 4)` to `(7, 5)`).\n\n**2. Move Evaluation:**\n\n*   **UP (Target: `(7, 6)`):**\n    -   **Safety:** The map shows `(7, 6)` is currently empty (based on the absence of 'T' or 'A' in the text description, and the ASCII map showing `.` or spaces there).\n    -   **Risk:** The Enemy Snake #0 is at `(5, 5)`. If they move `RIGHT`, they will be at `(6, 5)`. If they move `UP` twice in a row, they could threaten us later. However, moving `UP` keeps us at Y=6, which is above their current Y=5, maintaining distance.\n    -   **Self-Collision:** We are moving away from our body at `(7, 4)`. If we move `UP`, the tail will move from `(9, 4)` to `(8, 4)` (assuming we don't eat an apple). We will not hit our body.\n\n*   **LEFT (Target: `(6, 5)`):**\n    -   **Critical Safety Check:** The Enemy Snake #0 is currently at `(5, 5)`. The cell `(6, 5)` is adjacent to the enemy head.\n    -   **Collision Logic:** Since the enemy is at `(5, 5)`, they can move to `(6, 5)` by going `RIGHT`. If I move `LEFT` to `(6, 5)` and the enemy moves `RIGHT` to `(6, 5)`, we will collide head-to-head. This is a fatal collision for both of us. Given the enemy has 7 apples and is likely seeking the adjacent apples at `(3, 5)` and `(4, 5)`, moving `RIGHT` is a plausible move for them.\n    -   **Conclusion:** High risk of mutual death. Avoid.\n\n*   **DOWN (Target: `(7, 4)`):**\n    -   **Safety:** `(7, 4)` is currently my body segment.\n    -   **Collision Logic:** Moving `DOWN` puts my head into the cell occupied by my neck.\n    -   **Conclusion:** Immediate death. Avoid.\n\n*   **RIGHT (Target: `(8, 5)`):**\n    -   **Safety:** The map shows `(8, 5)` is currently empty.\n    -   **Risk:** This moves us closer to the right wall and the empty space where the enemy's tail currently ends (`(9, 7)` area). It moves away from the dense cluster of apples to the left (`(3, 5)`, `(4, 5)`, `(5, 3)`).\n    -   **Self-Collision:** We will not hit our body.\n\n**3. Strategy & Decision:**\n- The primary goal is survival while maintaining access to apples. The apples at `(3, 5)`, `(4, 5)`, and `(5, 3)` are the most valuable targets right now.\n- `LEFT` is too risky because of the enemy at `(5, 5)`.\n- `DOWN` is suicide.\n- `RIGHT` is safe but moves away from the apple cluster.\n- `UP` is safe (empty cell) and keeps the path to the apples open without risking immediate collision with the enemy. It also keeps our Y-coordinate higher, which is generally safer in the mid-game.\n\nI will move **UP**.\n\nUP",

Apples: 3.\n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at `(4, 5)`, Body `[(5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8)]`. Apples: 8.\n- **Apples:** Relevant nearby apples: `(3, 5)`, `(4, 8)`, `(5, 3)`. The apples at `(3, 5)` and `(4, 5)` are adjacent to the enemy head.\n- **Move History:** Last move was `UP` (from `(7, 5)` to `(7, 6)`).\n\n**2. Move Evaluation:**\n\n*   **UP (Target: `(7, 7)`):**\n    -   **Safety:** According to the board state, `(7, 7)` contains the body of Snake #0 (`T`). Moving here results in death.\n    -   **Conclusion:** Immediate death. Avoid.\n\n*   **DOWN (Target: `(7, 5)`):**\n    -   **Safety:** This is the cell we just left. Our tail will not have moved out of the way yet (standard simultaneous movement mechanics: new head -> old head -> old body -> tail moves). The head of a snake cannot move into the neck (the segment immediately behind it).\n    -   **Conclusion:** Immediate death. Avoid.\n\n*   **LEFT (Target: `(6, 6)`):**\n    -   **Safety:** `(6, 6)` is currently occupied by the body of Snake #0. Moving here results in death.\n    -   **Conclusion:** Immediate death. Avoid.\n\n*   **RIGHT (Target: `(8, 6)`):**\n    -   **Safety:** The ASCII map shows `(8, 6)` as empty (`.`). The text list of Snake #0's body does not include `(8, 6)`.\n    -   **Risk Assessment:**\n        -   **Head-on Collision:** The enemy head is at `(4, 5)`. They cannot reach `(8, 6)` in a single turn. They are tracking towards the apples at `(3, 5)` and `(4, 5)`.\n        -   **Future Positioning:** This moves us to the right edge of the board. This limits future movement options, but is currently the only path that avoids immediate death.\n    -   **Conclusion:** The only safe move.\n\n**3. Strategy & Decision:**\n- **Survival:** The priority is strictly survival. UP, DOWN, and LEFT are all fatal moves. RIGHT is the only valid choice.\n- **Long-term:** Once past this immediate danger (by moving RIGHT to `(8, 6)`), we should immediately look to turn UP (towards `(8, 7)`) or loop around to regain access to the central apples. Moving right puts us in a corner, so we must navigate carefully on the next turn.\n- **Summary:** We are trapped on three sides. We must move RIGHT.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

Safe. It leads toward the apple at (1, 6) and (2, 8).\n2.  **RIGHT:** Target (4, 5). **Death** (Backwards into body).\n3.  **UP:** Target (3, 6). Safe move.

It points toward the apple at (5, 3).\n\n**Strategic Comparison:**\n*   **UP (3, 6):** This is a strong move. It puts me one step away from the apple at (1, 6) and keeps me in the top half of the board where three apples (1, 6), (2, 8), and (4, 8) are clustered.\n*   **LEFT (2, 5):** Also good, but UP feels more proactive for reaching the current apple distribution.\n*   **DOWN (3, 4):** Moves toward (5, 3), but leaves the cluster of three apples behind.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will move UP to target the apple at (1, 6). From there, I can easily pivot to (2, 8) or (4, 8). Snake #1 is currently on the right side of the board and somewhat obstructed by its own tail and my body, giving me a distinct advantage in the upper-left quadrant.

Current Situation Analysis:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   **Head:** `(8, 6)` (Wait, correcting based on turn description: The text says Head: `(8, 6)`, Body: `[(7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4)]`. The map shows head at `(8, 6)` and tail at `(7, 4)`). *Correction:* The text description says `Head: (8, 6)`, but the map shows `1` at `(8, 6)` in the `y=6` row. Let's trust the text description of coordinates for precision. Wait, the map says `9 . . . . . . . . . .` on the top row (y=9). The map row `y=6` is `6 . A . . . T T T 1 .`. So the `1` is at `x=8, y=6`. The text says `Head: (8, 6)`. Okay, this is consistent. The body is listed as `[(7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4)]`. So the tail is `(7, 4)`.\n    *   **Apples:** 3.\n*   **Enemy Snake #0:**\n    *   **Head:** `(3, 5)`.\n    *   **Body:** `[(4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8)]`.\n    *   **Apples:** 9.\n*   **Apples:** `(5, 3), (4, 8), (6, 0), (1, 6), (2, 8)`.\n*   **Turn:** 27 / 150.\n\n**2. Move Evaluation (from Head at (8, 6)):**\n\n*   **UP (Target: (8, 7)):**\n    *   **Safety:** The ASCII map shows `(8, 7)` as `T` (part of Snake #0's body). The text confirms Snake #0 body includes `(8, 7)`.\n    *   **Result:** Immediate death.\n    *   **Avoid.**\n\n*   **DOWN (Target: (8, 5)):**\n    *   **Safety:** ASCII map `(8, 5)` is `.` (empty). Snake #0 body is not at `(8, 5)`.\n    *   **Apple Check:** No apple at `(8, 5)`.\n    *   **Future:** Keeps us relatively central. `(8, 4)` is currently empty (based on map row 4). `(7, 5)` is our own body? No, our body is `(7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4)`. Wait, if we move DOWN to `(8, 5)`, our tail `(7, 4)` might not move if we don't eat. But `down` from `(8, 6)` is `(8, 5)`. `(7, 5)` is currently occupied by our body. We cannot move there. `(8, 5)` is safe.\n    *   **Risk:** We are moving away from the enemy head at `(3, 5)` (distance 5). We are moving away from the apples at `(4, 8)` and `(2, 8)`. We are moving closer to `(5, 3)`.\n\n*   **LEFT (Target: (7, 6)):**\n    *   **Safety:** The text says our body is `[(7, 6), ...]`. Moving Left into `(7, 6)` is moving into our own neck.\n    *   **Result:** Immediate death.\n    *   **Avoid.**\n\n*   **RIGHT (Target: (9, 6)):**\n    *   **Safety:** ASCII map `(9, 6)` is `.` (empty). Snake #0 body ends at `(9, 8)` and `(9, 7)`. `(9, 6)` is clear.\n    *   **Risk:** This moves us to the far right edge. `(9, 5)` is likely empty. `(9, 7)` is enemy body. If we go RIGHT, next turn we might be trapped at the wall if `(9, 5)` is blocked or if we need to go UP. `(9, 7)` is blocked by enemy. So we couldn't go UP. `(10, 6)` is off board. `(8, 6)` would be behind us. So we could only go DOWN or LEFT (if our tail moves). If we go RIGHT, we might be forced DOWN eventually.\n\n**3. Comparison & Decision:**\n\n*   **Forbidden moves:** UP (wall/body), LEFT (body).\n*   **Remaining:** DOWN or RIGHT.\n\n*   **Analysis of Right (`(9, 6)`):** We hit the wall. This restricts future movement. We are at `x=9`. We cannot move Right. We cannot move Up (wall of enemy body at `(9, 7)`). We are forced to move Left (back to `(8, 6)`) or Down (to `(9, 5)`). This is a \"dead end\" risk.\n*   **Analysis of Down (`(8, 5)`):** We stay at `x=8`. We have access to `x=9` (Right), `x=7` (Left - if tail moves), `y=4` (Down - map shows empty). This keeps options open. Also, there is an apple at `(5, 3)`. Moving DOWN gets us closer to `(5, 3)` (distance 5.8 vs 4.2 if we moved UP towards `(4, 8)`, but UP was death). Moving DOWN avoids the enemy head at `(3, 5)` and the crowded upper area where the enemy body is (`(7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 6)...`).\n\n**Strategy:**\nSurvival is key. We have two options: DOWN and RIGHT. RIGHT leads to a wall and potential trapping. DOWN keeps us mobile and leads towards an apple at `(5, 3)` while keeping us away from the enemy's heavy traffic area in the upper half (y=6,7,8).\n\nI will move DOWN to `(8, 5)`.\n\nDOWN",

It maintains `x=8`, leaving `x=9` open for a future turn if needed. `(8, 3)` is also on the path to `(5, 3)`.\n\n*   **RIGHT (Target: (9, 5)):**\n    *   **Safety:** `Turn 28` map showed `(9, 5)` as empty (row 5 was `. . .

Being pinned against the wall limits maneuverability compared to staying at `x=8`.\n\n**3. Comparison & Decision:**\n*   **Forbidden:** UP, LEFT.\n*   **Remaining:** DOWN, RIGHT.\n*   **Comparison:** Both DOWN `(8, 4)` and RIGHT `(9, 5)` are safe.

Next turn, likely continue DOWN towards `(5, 3)`, or potentially LEFT if the tail clears `(7, 5)` to snipe `(6, 0)` or navigate the bottom left.\n\n**Final Decision:** DOWN is the safest and most strategic move.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

I am now adjacent to the apple at (1, 6).\n\n**Evaluation of Moves for ID 0:**\n1.  **UP:** Target (2, 7). Safe. This positions me well to grab (2, 8) and (4, 8) later.\n2.  **DOWN:** Target (2, 5). Safe. It moves me away from the apples in the top-left.\n3.  **LEFT:** Target (1, 6). **Safe & Goal.** This collects an apple, increasing my score and length.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Target (3, 6). **Death** (Backwards into body).\n\n**Strategic Comparison:**\n*   **LEFT (1, 6):** This is the logical choice. It consumes the nearest apple and maintains momentum toward the other apples at (2, 8) and (4, 8).\n*   **UP / DOWN:** These are suboptimal compared to immediately taking the point at (1, 6).\n\n**Snake #1 Analysis:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (8, 4). It is far enough away that its immediate moves (likely toward (5, 3) or (6, 0)) do not threaten my current position.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to take the apple at (1, 6). From (1, 6), move UP to (1, 7) and then (1, 8) or (2, 8) to secure the remaining apples in the top-left quadrant. This path keeps me away from my own coiled body in the center and maintains my lead.\n\nLEFT",

My body is at `(8, 5)` and `(8, 6)`. Enemy body is at `y=5` or higher.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves towards `(5, 3)`. However, this moves me closer to the wall at `x=0` and potentially traps me if I continue left, as `x=7` reduces the \"width\" of the safe space compared to staying at `x=8` or moving to `x=9`.\n\n*   **RIGHT (Target: (9, 4)):**\n    *   **Safety:** `Turn 28` map showed `(9, 4)` as empty. No body parts listed there.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me to the right wall. While safe now, being at `x=9` restricts future movement (only 3 other directions). Moving DOWN or LEFT keeps me at `x=8`, which has access to `x=9` if needed. Since `(9, 4)` is at the same Y-level as `(8, 4)` and not strictly closer to the primary apple targets than `(8, 3)`, it offers less immediate value.\n\n**3. Comparison & Decision:**\n*   **Forbidden:** UP.\n*   **Remaining:** DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   `DOWN (8, 3)` is safe and moves directly towards `(5, 3)` and `(6, 0)`. It maintains the column `x=8`, keeping the right wall available for maneuvering.\n    *   `LEFT (7, 4)` is safe but moves towards the left wall, reducing space.\n    *   `RIGHT (9, 4)` is safe but puts me against the wall immediately.\n    *   `DOWN` is the most balanced move: it progresses towards apples and preserves future options by avoiding walls.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to `(8, 3)` to approach the apple at `(5, 3)` while keeping the option to slide right to `(9, 3)` or continue down towards `(6, 0)` next turn.\n\nDOWN",

My body forms a \"tail\" stretching right and curling around the middle-right. Snake #1 is near the bottom right.\n\n**Evaluation of Moves for ID 0:**\n1.  **UP:** Target (1, 7). Safe. This is a very strong move as it positions me to grab apples at (2, 8) and (4, 8) immediately.\n2.  **DOWN:** Target (1, 5). Safe.

It creates space between my head and my body segments at (3, 5)-(5, 5) and creates a path to two nearby apples at (2, 8) and (4, 8).\n*   **DOWN (1, 5):** Viable, but (0, 3) is further away than the upper apples, and moving down puts me in the \"pocket\" created by my body at the y=5 and y=6 lines.\n\n**Snake #1 Analysis:**\nSnake #1 is at (8, 3), likely moving toward (5, 3) or (6, 0). It is not an immediate threat to my head or my body segments unless I move into its path, which is currently across the board.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to (1, 7), then RIGHT to (2, 7) and UP to (2, 8) to collect that apple.

The only opening to reach them is at x=9, y=7 (since the map shows row 7 is `T T T . . . T T T .`). I would need to go Right to x=9, then Up to y=7, then Left. However, the enemy head is at `(1, 6)`.

Comparison & Decision:**\n*   **Forbidden:** UP.\n*   **Safe Moves:** DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   `LEFT` moves me closer to `(5, 3)`. It increases the distance to the wall and keeps me central to the lower board.\n    *   `DOWN` moves me away from the nearest apple `(5, 3)` towards `(6, 0)`. While `(6, 0)` is an apple, `(5, 3)` is closer.\n    *   `RIGHT` moves me to a dead-end (wall) and away from apples.\n*   **Conclusion:** `LEFT` is the optimal move.

Body: [(8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)].\n*   **Apples:** (5, 3), (4, 8), (6, 0), (2, 8), (0, 3).\n*   **Threats:** No immediate head-on threats. Snake #1 is far away. My own body clusters the middle-right.\n\n**Evaluation of Moves for ID 0:**\n1.  **UP:** Target (1, 8). Safe. Positions me one step away from apple (2, 8) and two steps from (4, 8).\n2.  **DOWN:** Target (1, 6). **Death** (Backwards into body).\n3.  **LEFT:** Target (0, 7). Safe.

It moves toward the cluster of apples in the top-left/middle while maintaining distance from my own body at y=6 and y=5. It provides a clear path to (2, 8) and (4, 8).\n*   **RIGHT (2, 7):** Less ideal. While it leads to (2, 8), it moves closer into the \"U\" shape of the body, which might restrict movement if I need to dodge.\n*   **LEFT (0, 7):** Safe, but takes me further from the immediate high-value apples at (2, 8) and (4, 8).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to (1, 8), then RIGHT to (2, 8) to eat the first apple. From (2, 8), continue RIGHT toward (4, 8). This path keeps the snake in the upper open area, allowing the tail to clear out of the middle section.\n\nUP",

Therefore, moving Down is the safest way to open up the board and head toward the cluster of apples at (6,0) and eventually (4,8) or (2,8). Moving Up risks getting trapped against the enemy's body at row 7.\n\nAlthough the apple at (5,3) is to the Left, going Left risks trapping myself in the 6x8 or 5x8 column later if I need to go Down. Moving Down keeps my vertical options open and prevents getting cornered.\n\nDecision: Go DOWN to (6, 2).\n\nDOWN",

If I am at `(6, 0)`, the \"Backwards\" move (UP) would be into `(6, 1)`, which is now empty (assuming I ate the apple).\n    *   **Crucially:** At `(6, 2)`, I am \"safest\" against the enemy at `(6, 7)` by staying lower.\n    *   If I move DOWN to `(6, 1)`, I am closer to the apple at `(6, 0)` and further from the enemy at `(2, 8)`.\n    *   If I move LEFT or RIGHT, I divert from the apple at `(6, 0)` and open up potential crossfire with the enemy (though unlikely this turn).\n3.  **Risk Assessment:**\n    *   Moving DOWN to `(6, 1)` is the most direct path to the closest apple.\n    *   It maintains the vertical option.\n    *   The only risk is if I trap myself at `(6, 0)` in future turns, but at `(6, 1)` I still have LEFT/RIGHT options.\n    *   Therefore, DOWN is the optimal move to secure the imminent apple and continue the flow.\n\n**Decision:** Move DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

It also keeps me in the relatively open upper-right quadrant.\n*   **UP (3, 9):** Safe, but doesn't progress toward an apple.\n*   **DOWN (3, 7):** Safe, but begins to move me into the \"pocket\" created by my body. It's better to stay on the outside of my own coils for now.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nGrab (4, 8) this turn. After consuming it, my tail will not grow (but a new segment will be added at the head position next turn). I should then look toward the center or right side. Since the apple at (5, 3) is likely to be contested or taken by Snake #1, I will evaluate moving toward (6, 0) or simply maintaining a safe posture in the upper half of the board while Snake #1 navigates the bottom.\n\nRIGHT",

I just collected an apple.\n*   **Snake Body:** My body currently occupies (4, 8), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), and (6, 6).\n*   **Apples:** There is an apple right next to me at (3, 7). Other apples are further away: (5, 3), (0, 3), (0, 1), (8, 4).\n*   **Enemy (Snake #1):** Head at (5, 0). It is at the bottom of the board and currently poses no threat.\n\n**Evaluation of Moves for ID 0:**\n1.  **UP:** Target (4, 8). **Death** (Backwards into body).\n2.  **DOWN:** Target (4, 6). Safe, but leads into a narrow space between my body segments at y=7 and y=5.\n3.  **LEFT:** Target (3, 7). **Safe and secures an apple.** This is the move projected in the previous rationale.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Target (5, 7). Safe. This leads into open space on the right side of the board.\n\n**Strategic Comparison:**\n*   **LEFT (3, 7):** This is the most efficient move. It collects the adjacent apple. From (3, 7), the path forward is slightly constricted by my body at (3, 8), (3, 6), and (2, 6). However, the tail at (6, 6) is moving, which will open up the middle of the board. Once I take (3, 7), I will likely have to head left toward (0, 3) or circle back around.\n*   **RIGHT (5, 7):** Safe, but ignores the immediate point.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (3, 7) to harvest the apple. After that, look to exit the \"S-curve\" my body has created. Since my tail is clearing out from the right side (6, 6), I will eventually have space to maneuver back toward the center or head toward the apples at (0, 3) and (0, 1) by going around the left side of my current body loop.\n\nLEFT",

          "move": "UP",
          "rationale": "My current position is (5, 0), having moved left from (6, 0).\nMy body currently occupies: [(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)]. The tail is at (6, 3).\nIf I move LEFT again to (4, 0), my body will effectively shift to: [(5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)].\nI am currently at the bottom edge of the board (y=0).\n- Moving DOWN is invalid (off board).\n- Moving UP would be to (5, 1). This is not part of my current body path (which runs along x=6). This is valid.\n- Moving LEFT would be to (4, 0). This is empty and valid.\n- Moving RIGHT would be to (6, 0). This is currently my body segment. However, by the time I move there, my tail will have advanced from (6, 3) to (6, 2). The segment at (6, 0) will still be occupied by my body (specifically, the segment that is currently my head at (5, 0)). Hitting any part of my body is fatal. So moving RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSo, UP and LEFT are the valid moves.\nUP takes me to (5, 1). This leads into the open board where I can navigate to the apples at (5, 3) or (0, 3), (0, 1).\nLEFT takes me to (4, 0). This leads along the bottom edge towards (0,0) and the apples at (0,1) and (0,3).\n\nComparing UP and LEFT:\n- Moving UP to (5, 1) keeps me in the center-bottom, providing access to multiple apples and allowing me to avoid the walls. I can reach (5, 3) in two moves (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (5,3).\n- Moving LEFT to (4, 0) commits me to the bottom path. While this is safe, it leaves the central apples slightly harder to reach if I need to turn back.\n\nHowever, looking closely at the map for (5, 1):\nMy body is at (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3).\nMoving UP to (5, 1) is safe. From there, I can go to (5, 2). From there, (5, 3) is an apple.\nI must also consider the enemy snake. Their head is at (4, 7).\nThe apple at (5, 3) is a high-value target.\nIf I move UP, I can secure (5, 3) rapidly.\nIf I move LEFT, I chase the apples on the left.\nActually, the board shows an apple at (5, 3) and another at (5, 4)? No, board says (5, 4) is empty. Board says (5, 3) is A.\nWait, board row 3: `A . . . . A T . . .` -> (0,3) is A, (5,3) is A.\nSo (5, 3) is indeed an apple.\nTarget: (5, 3).\nPath from (5, 1): (5, 2) -> (5, 3). This is 2 moves.\nPath from (5, 1): (4, 1) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3) -> (3, 3) -> ... -> (0, 3). This is a long path.\nPath from (4, 0): (3, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> (0, 1) (Apple).\nPath from (4, 0): (3, 0) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 5) -> (3, 6) (Enemy Body!). Be careful.\n\nLet's re-evaluate UP.\nMoving UP to (5, 1).\nMy body currently occupies x=6 mostly.\nMoving to (5, 1) is distinct from my body.\nFuture moves from (5, 1): LEFT (4, 1), RIGHT (6, 1 - occupied), UP (5, 2), DOWN (5, 0 - occupied).\nSo from (5, 1), I can go UP or LEFT.\nUP leads to (5, 2), then (5, 3) (Apple).\nThis is a very efficient path to an apple.\nWhy did I move LEFT last turn? Last turn I was at (6, 0). I moved LEFT to (5, 0).\nThe rationale was to avoid the right dead end and approach left apples.\nNow that I am at (5, 0), moving UP is actually better than moving LEFT because:\n1. It opens up the board.\n2. It gives me a direct path to the apple at (5, 3).\n3. The path to (0, 1) via LEFT is long (4 steps). The path to (5, 3) via UP is 2 steps.\n4. I can always go LEFT later if the (5, 3) path is blocked.\n5. The enemy snake is at (4, 7). It is moving. I am at (5, 0). There is no collision risk immediately.\n\nSo, UP is the best move.\n\nCheck for immediate threats:\n- Enemy 0 at (4, 7). Moves likely towards apples or open space.\n- Apples at (0, 1), (0, 3), (3, 7), (5, 3), (8, 4).\n- I am at (5, 0).\n- Moving UP to (5, 1).\n- Is (5, 1) safe? Yes.\n- Is it a good move? Yes, it points me towards (5, 3).\n\nWait, I should verify if (5, 2) is safe if I plan to go there next.\nIf I go (5, 0) -> (5, 1), my tail moves from (6, 3) -> (6, 2).\nIf I then go (5, 1) -> (5, 2), my tail moves to (6, 1).\n(5, 2) is empty.\n(5, 3) is an apple.\nSo the path is clear.\n\nWhat about the apple at (0, 1)?\nTo get there from (5, 0) via LEFT:\n(5, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> (0, 1).\nThat's 6 moves.\nTo get to (5, 3) via UP:\n(5, 0) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 3).\nThat's 3 moves.\nThe apple at (5, 3) is much closer.\n\nIs there any reason to go LEFT?\nIf I go LEFT, I am hugging the wall. The enemy is far away. It is safe.\nBut UP gives me more freedom.\nAlso, looking at the board, the enemy is in the top left. If I go UP, I am in the center.\nIf I go LEFT, I am in the bottom left.\nThe apple at (8, 4) is to the right.\nIf I go UP, I can eventually go RIGHT and get (8, 4).\nIf I go LEFT, I am committed to the left side.\n\nSo, UP is definitely the superior move.\n\nOne final check on immediate death:\n- UP to (5, 1).\n- Board at (5, 1) is '.'.\n- Is it my body? No, my body is at x=6.\n- Is it the enemy body? No, enemy is at x=4+.\n- Is it off board? No.\n- Is it a head-on collision? I don't know where enemy is going, but he is at (4, 7). He is unlikely to reach (5, 1) in one turn. He would have to go DOWN to (4, 6), then DOWN... no, he can't reach (5, 1) in one move. The distance is too great.\n\nTherefore, UP is safe and optimal.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (5, 1) to approach the apple at (5, 3) and open up the board.\n\nUP",

Moving LEFT to (1, 7) is the only valid move to avoid hitting the body. Once at (1, 7), the segment at (1, 6) will have moved to (1, 7), and the segment at (0, 6) is not present (the board shows (1, 6) connects to (2, 6)). I need to navigate out of this internal knot to reach the open areas of the board.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue moving LEFT until (0, 7) is reached, or clear the body obstruction at (1, 6). The ultimate goal is to move DOWN towards the western edge (0, y) to collect apples at (0, 3) and (0, 1). Monitor Snake #1, as it is currently near the apple at (5, 3) and might move toward the left side of the board soon.\n\nLEFT",

The board string shows `A` at index 0 and index 6? Let's re-read the prompt's specific coordinate list vs the board string.\n    *   Prompt list: `(5, 3)`, `(0, 3)`, `(0, 1)`, `(8, 4)`, `(9, 2)`.\n    *   Board string Row 3: `A . . . .
