From my current position (2, 8), I need to move 1 unit LEFT and 2 units DOWN.\n- **UP:** (2, 9) - Moves toward the edge, away from all apples.\n- **DOWN:** (2, 7) - Moves closer to (1, 6) and (2, 2).\n- **LEFT:** (1, 8) - Moves closer to (1, 6) and (0, 3).\n- **RIGHT:** (3, 8) - Moves back to my previous position.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are excellent moves. Moving LEFT now puts me at the x-coordinate of my primary target (1, 6) and keeps me closer to the left edge, potentially walling off that section for myself. Moving DOWN is also valid, but aligning x-coordinates first is a standard approach.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will path toward (1, 6). After consuming it, I will evaluate the cluster at (0, 3), (1, 2), and (2, 2). Since Snake #0 is at (4, 2), they are very close to (2, 2) and (1, 2). I should be cautious if we both head for the same apple in that area.\n\nLEFT",

Moves me directly below apple (3, 7).\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- Snake #0 is currently at (0, 2) and likely going for apple (0, 3) or (0, 0).\n- Apple (3, 7) is the closest to me. \n- If I move UP to (2, 7), I can take the apple at (3, 7) on the next turn by moving RIGHT to (3, 7).\n- If I move RIGHT to (3, 6), I can take the apple at (3, 7) on the next turn by moving UP to (3, 7).\n\nThe move RIGHT to (3, 6) puts me in a better position to pivot toward apple (8, 7) or (4, 2) after I collect (3, 7). However, UP to (2, 7) is also viable. Given the current board, moving RIGHT to (3, 6) keeps me more central.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (3, 6), then move UP to (3, 7) to collect the apple. From (3, 7), I will look at the apple at (8, 7) or head down toward (4, 2) depending on Snake #0's positioning. Snake #0 is currently positioned near the bottom left, so I have clear access to the top and right side of the board.\n\nRIGHT",

Collect an immediate apple (grow to length 4, score 3)\n2. Position myself to collect (0, 0) next turn\n3. Stay in the optimal zone for apple collection\n4.

Then next turn, DOWN to (1, 2) would hit my body. So that's still blocked.\n\nBut moving UP keeps me at the left edge with limited flexibility.

Instead, move UP to approach row 3 carefully, or continue LEFT toward column 0. The goal is to reach (0, 3) to collect the next apple and maintain score parity with enemy snake.\n\nLEFT",

I move to (0, 0) and eat an apple, taking a 8-7 lead. This is strategically optimal because:\n- Immediate apple gain puts me ahead\n- (0, 0) is in the corner, so I'll have limited options after, but I can turn UP or RIGHT\n- Enemy snake is still on the far right (9, 6), no immediate threat\n- The score becomes 8-7 in my favor\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turn:**\nAfter eating the apple at (0, 0), I'll be at (0, 0) with score 8. Next options from (0, 0):\n- UP to (0, 1): safe, move toward middle\n- RIGHT to (1, 0): would hit my own body (my tail will be there briefly)\n- LEFT/DOWN: off board\n\nI should move UP to (0, 1) to maintain flexibility. Then look toward apples at (5, 0) and (6, 1). The enemy is far away, so I have time to safely collect apples on the left/bottom before racing to the right side.

Moving directly backwards into my own body \u2192 Self-collision \u2192 DEATH \u274c\n\n4. **UP to (0, 2):** \n   - Safe cell (not off board, not my body, not enemy body)\n   - Enemy at (9, 4) is far away (9 squares east)\n   - Opens paths toward apples\n   - SAFE \u2713\n\n**Why UP?**\nI'm in a constrained position with my body forming a tight cluster around the left edge. UP is the only safe move available. This move positions me to eventually maneuver eastward toward the apple cluster.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nFrom (0, 2), continue working around my body to eventually move right (east) toward the nearest apple at (5, 0). I need to carefully navigate the tight space on the left side of the board. The enemy remains far away, so I have time to execute this plan methodically.\n\nUP",
