Wait, at y=2, the board shows A at (5,2) and (8,2), but (6,2) is empty (just a dot). That's safe. Also, y=2 is in bounds.  \n3. **LEFT \u2192 (5,3)** - Empty on board (dot on row y=3). Safe.  \n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (7,3)** - Empty on board, safe.  \n\nNo immediate dangers from known body segments (both snakes are length 1 right now, so no body except head).

Snake #1 might also go for (3,1) or (3,0).  \n\nI should monitor whether the enemy snake is blocked by walls on its side.

Keep space to maneuver\u2014prefer paths that don\u2019t box me in. Try to grow to length 2 quickly to protect against head-on collisions.  \n\nFor this turn, **DOWN** gets me closer to apple (5,2), with options next turn to go LEFT to eat it or RIGHT to (7,2) if the enemy approaches.  \n\nSince all initial moves are safe, choosing DOWN gives a direct path to the nearest apple.  \n\nDOWN",

I will check the validity of moving UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n**Current State:**\n- My Head: (0, 4)\n- Enemy Head: (6, 2)\n- Apples: (5, 2), (8, 2), (9, 5), (3, 0), (3, 1)\n- My Body: None (so I cannot collide with myself unless I move backwards, which is impossible from an empty body)\n- Enemy Body: None (so I cannot collide with enemy body)\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n\n1.  **UP (0, 5):**\n    -   **Safety:** Valid coordinates. No body obstacles (my body is empty, enemy body is empty).\n    -   **Head-on Collision Check:** I move to (0, 5). The enemy is at (6, 2). For a collision to occur, the enemy would need to land on (0, 5) or I would need to land on (6, 2). Neither is possible given the distance. The enemy can move max distance 1. So, no collision.\n    -   **Utility:** Moves closer to the apple at (9, 5). (Distance decreases from 9 to 8).\n\n2.  **DOWN (0, 3):**\n    -   **Safety:** Valid coordinates. No body obstacles.\n    -   **Head-on Collision Check:** Enemy cannot reach (0, 3) in one turn.\n    -   **Utility:** Moves away from the only apple on the same Y-level (9, 5). Moves closer to apples at (3, 0) and (3, 1), but I am at x=0 and those are at x=3.\n\n3.  **LEFT (-1, 4):**\n    -   **Safety:** Invalid coordinates (x < 0). Instant death. Discard.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (1, 4):**\n    -   **Safety:** Valid coordinates. No body obstacles.\n    -   **Head-on Collision Check:** Enemy cannot reach (1, 4).\n    -   **Utility:** Moves horizontally towards apples. However, my current Y (4) has an apple at (9, 5).\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **LEFT** is death.\n- **DOWN** and **RIGHT** are safe but lead away from the immediate line of apples at Y=5 and X=8,9.\n- **UP** is safe and moves me along the Y=5 row where the apple at (9, 5) is located. It also keeps me away from the enemy's position in the lower right quadrant (Y=2).\n\n**Rationale:**\nI choose UP to align myself with the apple at (9, 5). This sets up a straight line of movement towards that apple in subsequent turns. The enemy is far away at (6, 2) and moving towards apples near (5, 2) and (8, 2), so moving to Y=5 minimizes immediate interaction with the enemy.\n\nUP",

Last turn it was at (0,3)? Wait, let's check the board state above: snake #1 is at (0,4) in the board? Actually, the board shows \"1\" at (0,4). So enemy head is at (0,4).\n\nWait, in the initial state this turn, my head is at (6,2) and enemy head is at (0,4). Also, the apples are the same.\n\n**Possible moves from my head (6,2):**\n- UP: (6,3) - currently empty (dot on board at y=3, x=6? The board shows row 2: at x=6 is \"0\" (my head), so UP to (6,3) should be empty (dot).\n- DOWN: (6,1) - empty? Row y=1: at x=6 is a dot.\n- LEFT: (5,2) - this is an apple! (apple at (5,2))\n- RIGHT: (7,2) - empty? Row y=2: at x=7 is a dot (just after my head at x=6, and then x=7 is dot, and x=8 is 'A').\n\nSo LEFT goes directly to an apple at (5,2).\n\n**Safety check:**\nAll moves are within bounds (x from 0 to 9, y from 0 to 9).\nNo body segments for any snake (both snakes are length 1), so no risk of hitting a body.\nEnemy snake is far away at (0,4), so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nTherefore, all moves are safe.\n\n**Strategy:**\nSince LEFT leads directly to an apple (5,2), I should take it to grow to length 2 and gain a point. This will give me a body segment (tail) at (6,2), which will help protect against head-on collisions in the future (if an enemy hits my body, they die and I survive).\n\nAfter eating, my head will be at (5,2) and my tail will remain at (6,2) (since I grow, so the tail doesn't move this turn). So next turn, I will have head at (5,2) and body at (6,2).\n\nThis is the best immediate move to gain an advantage.\n\nOther moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) don't get an apple this turn, so they are less efficient.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turns:**\nAfter eating the apple at (5,2), I will be at (5,2) with body at (6,2). Then I can consider going to other apples: for example, (8,2) is nearby, or (3,0) and (3,1) are on the left. But also watch enemy #1 at (0,4) - they might be heading down towards (3,0) or (3,1). So perhaps after eating, move RIGHT towards (8,2) to avoid confrontation until longer.\n\nBut for now, directly take the apple.\n\nLEFT",

Wait, the state says \"Apples collected: 1\", but we just ate an apple. Actually, the state provided is at the start of turn 2, and we just moved to (5,2) by going LEFT.

But it is far.\n\nTo efficiently collect apples, we should move towards the cluster at left: (3,0) and (3,1).\n\nSo either LEFT or DOWN is good.\n\nLEFT goes to (4,2) - same row as apples at (3,0) and (3,1) but they are at y=0 and y=1.\nDOWN goes to (5,1) - closer in y to the apples.\n\nActually, (3,0) is at x=3,y=0 and (3,1) at x=3,y=1.\nOur current (5,2): \n- To reach (3,0), we need to go left twice and down twice.\n- To reach (3,1), left twice and down once.\n\nSo moving DOWN to (5,1) gets us closer in y to both.\nThen next turn, we can go LEFT to (4,1) and then to (3,1) or (3,0).\n\nAlternatively, LEFT to (4,2) then next turn down to (4,1) and then left to (3,1).\n\nBoth are similar.\n\nBut note: we have a tail at (6,2). So if we move DOWN to (5,1), our body will be at (5,2) and (6,2). This might block some paths later.\n\nFor now, both are safe.\n\nAlso, consider future moves: from (5,1), we can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT? \n- RIGHT: (6,1) - empty? Yes.\n- LEFT: (4,1) - empty.\n- UP: (5,2) - but that is our body? Actually, after moving down, our body will be at (5,2) and (6,2). So (5,2) is our body next turn. So UP from (5,1) would be into body? So next turn, if we are at (5,1), then UP is not safe because (5,2) is body. Similarly, from (4,2) after moving left, our body will be at (5,2) and (6,2). So from (4,2), UP (4,3) and DOWN (4,1) and LEFT (3,2) are safe.\n\nSo both moves have 3 safe options next turn.\n\nI think DOWN is slightly better because it gets us closer to the apples in y.\n\nLong-term plan: after this, move towards (3,1) and (3,0). Then consider going to (8,2) or (9,1) on the right, but watch out for enemy #1.\n\nSo for this turn, I choose DOWN to get closer to the apples.\n\nDOWN",

Their immediate potential moves are:\n        *   UP to (5,2) -> Blocked by own tail (5,2) -> Illegal.\n        *   DOWN to (5,0) -> Empty (T is at (4,2)) -> Safe.\n        *   LEFT to (4,1) -> Empty -> Safe.\n        *   RIGHT to (6,1) -> Empty -> Safe.\n        *   *Projected Enemy Head Positions:* (5,0), (4,1), (6,1).\n    *   **Head-on Collision:** My potential moves:\n        *   **RIGHT:** My head would be (2,5). Projected enemy heads are far away (X=4-6). Safe.\n        *   **UP:** My head would be (1,6). Safe.\n        *   **DOWN:** My head would be (1,4). Safe.\n        *   **LEFT:** My head would be (0,5). This is the cell I just moved *from*. Moving backwards into the space just vacated is usually treated as hitting my own body (as per rules: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body ... counts as hitting yourself\"). Since I have no body segments yet, this might be safe strictly speaking, but it's a wasted move. However, strictly speaking, I moved from (0,5) to (1,5). The cell (0,5) is now empty. Moving back to (0,5) is likely physically possible, but I have no tail. I will treat it as safe but suboptimal.\n    *   **Wall Collision:** All directions are within bounds (0-9).\n\n3.  **Opportunity Assessment (Apples):**\n    *   **Target (9, 5):** Currently at X=1, Y=5.

Distance is large.\n    *   **Target (3, 0) / (3, 1):** Currently at X=1, Y=5. Moving DOWN to (1,4) puts me closer to Y=0/1.\n\n4.  **Strategy:**\n    *   I am at (1,5). The apple at (9,5) is on the same row. It is logical to pursue this apple in a straight line if possible.\n    *   The enemy is at Y=1/Y=2. Moving DOWN to (1,4) brings me slightly closer to the enemy's Y-level, but the X-distance is still significant (X=1 vs X=5).\n    *   The path at (2,5), (3,5)... is currently empty.\n    *   I should continue moving RIGHT towards the apple at (9,5). This maximizes progress towards a point while keeping me on a relatively safe row (Y=5) that is currently clear.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Move RIGHT to (2,5).\n    *   This move is safe from walls and immediate collisions.\n    *   It progresses towards the nearest apple on the same Y-level.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\n**START PLAN**\nLong-term plan: Continue moving RIGHT along Y=5 until the apple at (9,5) is reached or blocked.

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\n**My snake (ID 0):**\n- Head: (5, 1) (after moving DOWN last turn)\n- Body: [(5, 2)] (tail at (5,2))\n- Apples collected: 1 (we ate an apple at (5,2) last turn, so now we have 2 apples? But the state says \"Apples collected: 1\". Actually, the state provided is at the start of turn 3. Last turn (turn 2) we moved to (5,2) and ate an apple. So after that move, we should have 2 apples. However, the state says \"Your snake (ID 0) apples: 1\". This is inconsistent. I must trust the provided state: it says we have 1 apple collected. Perhaps the state is before we ate? But we did eat. Wait, the turn is 3/150, and the state lists apples collected as 1. So it seems the state is after our last move but before updating the apple count? Or there's a delay. Actually, the game state is at the beginning of turn 3. So our snake has collected 1 apple so far (from before), and we just ate one at (5,2) last turn? But the apple count is still 1. This is confusing.\n\nLooking back: in the last rationale, we thought we ate an apple at (5,2). But the state provided for turn 3 lists apples at: (8,2), (9,5), (3,0), (3,1), (9,1). There is no (5,2) apple, so we did eat it. But our apple count is still 1. This suggests that the apple count is updated after the move? Or the state is given before the apple is credited? The rules say: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point\". So we should have grown and gained. But our body is now length 2 (head and one body segment), so we did grow. But the apple count is still 1. Perhaps the state shows the apple count from the start of the turn? I think there might be a misunderstanding.\n\nActually, the state says: \"Scores so far: - Your snake (ID 0) apples: 1\". This is the score at the start of turn 3. So we have collected 1 apple in total so far. But we just ate one at (5,2) last turn? That apple should be credited. So why is it still 1? Perhaps the state is after the move but the apple count hasn't been updated? Or the apple was not eaten? The board state shows no apple at (5,2), so it was eaten. This is inconsistent.\n\nI should rely on the provided state: we have 1 apple collected, head at (5,1), body at (5,2). So we are length 2.\n\n**Apples at:** (8,2), (9,5), (3,0), (3,1), (9,1)\n\n**Enemy snake #1:** Head at (1,5), body none, apples 0.\n\n**Board state:** Our head is at (5,1), tail at (5,2). Enemy head at (1,5).\n\nPossible moves from (5,1):\n- UP: (5,2) -> but this is our tail. However, moving backwards into the tail is forbidden and kills us. So UP is unsafe.\n- DOWN: (5,0) -> within bounds, no obstacle? The board shows no snake or apple at (5,0). So safe.\n- LEFT: (4,1) -> within bounds, no obstacle. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (6,1) -> within bounds, no obstacle. Safe.\n\nSo unsafe: UP (into own tail).\nSafe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, which move to choose?\nApples nearby:\n- (3,0) and (3,1) are to the left and down.\n- (9,1) is to the right.\n- (8,2) is up and right.\n- (9,5) is far.\n\nWe want to collect apples safely. The closest cluster is at (3,0) and (3,1). So moving LEFT or DOWN is good.\n\nLEFT to (4,1) gets us closer in x.\nDOWN to (5,0) gets us closer in y to (3,0).\n\nAlso, consider future moves:\nFrom (4,1):\n- Can go UP (4,2), DOWN (4,0), LEFT (3,1), RIGHT (5,1) [which is our current head, but next turn it will be body? After moving, our body will be at (5,1) and (5,2). So (5,1) will be body. So from (4,1), RIGHT would be into body? So next turn, RIGHT is unsafe. But UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\nFrom (5,0):\n- UP (5,1) -> body (unsafe), DOWN (5,-1) -> out of bounds (unsafe), LEFT (4,0), RIGHT (6,0). So only LEFT and RIGHT are safe next turn.\n\nFrom (6,1):\n- UP (6,2), DOWN (6,0), LEFT (5,1) -> body (unsafe), RIGHT (7,1). So three safe moves.\n\nSo:\n- LEFT to (4,1): has 3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, LEFT) but avoids RIGHT.\n- DOWN to (5,0): has only 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT) which is restrictive.\n- RIGHT to (6,1): has 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).\n\nTherefore, DOWN is less favorable because it limits future moves.\n\nLEFT and RIGHT both have 3 safe moves.\n\nNow, apples: LEFT gets us closer to (3,0) and (3,1). RIGHT gets us closer to (9,1) and (8,2), but (9,1) is at the edge.\n\nAlso, enemy snake #1 is at (1,5). It might be heading towards the left-side apples. So we should move quickly to (3,0) and (3,1) before it does.\n\nSo LEFT is better.\n\nLong-term plan: Move towards (3,0) and (3,1) to collect them. Then consider going to (8,2) or (9,1). Watch out for enemy #1.\n\nTherefore, this turn I choose LEFT to (4,1).\n\nLEFT",

Only 2 safe moves next turn. Dangerous because UP is blocked by our own body. Still survivable if we choose LEFT or RIGHT next turn.\n\n- **LEFT to (2, 1)**: No apple, but next turn we'd have more options (can go UP/DOWN/LEFT), keeps us flexible. But misses immediate apple opportunity.\n\n- **UP to (3, 2)**: No apple, but also safe and flexible next turn (can go UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT potentially).\n\nGiven the goal to eat apples but also avoid traps \u2014 Currently, apple at (3,0) is closest. Downside is losing mobility afterward (only 2 moves available next turn). But still survivable if we plan. Also, Snake #1 may try to go for apples at (3,0) in future turns, so eating it now denies them.\n\nGiven my apple lead, denying apples to enemy while safely growing seems wise if the risk is manageable.\n\nCheck if enemy #1 could threaten (3,0) after their move: They would need two moves to get there from (3,5) \u2014 but if they go DOWN to (3,4) this turn, possibly DOWN again later, they could reach it. So better to eat it now.\n\nShort-term risk: Going DOWN seems acceptable \u2014 next turn choose LEFT (2,0) or RIGHT (4,0) to regain mobility.\n\n**Plan for next turn after DOWN**:  \nFrom (3,0), body [(3,1),(4,1),(5,1)], avoid UP. Pick LEFT or RIGHT depending on which is safer given enemy position.\n\nGiven the above, best immediate move: DOWN to eat the apple and extend lead.\n\nDOWN",

All are safe for them (no obstacles). They might go for an apple? Nearest apples are at (5,9) (far), (9,5) (same row, 5 steps right), (8,2) (down and left), etc. They are not an immediate threat to us.\n\n**Evaluating safe moves:**\n- LEFT to (2,0): This moves away from the center. Next turn, from (2,0), possible moves: UP (2,1) (empty), DOWN (2,-1) (off board), LEFT (1,0) (empty), RIGHT (3,0) (but this is our current head position? Actually, after moving, our body will be at [(3,0), (3,1), (4,1)]? Wait, let's clarify body movement.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (2,0):\n- New head: (2,0)\n- Body segments shift: the old head (3,0) becomes the first body segment, then (3,1), then (4,1). The tail (5,1) is lost (since we didn't eat an apple this move).\nSo body becomes: [(2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (4,1)]? Wait, no: we had length 4 (head + 3 segments). After moving without eating, we stay length 4: head moves to (2,0), then the body segments follow: the first segment becomes the old head (3,0), then (3,1), then (4,1). The tail (5,1) is dropped.\n\nSimilarly for RIGHT to (4,0): head at (4,0), body: [(3,0), (3,1), (4,1)].\n\nNow, which move is better?\n\n**LEFT to (2,0):**\n- Next turn from (2,0): possible moves: UP (2,1) (empty), LEFT (1,0) (empty), RIGHT (3,0) (our own body segment). So safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n- Also, we are closer to the apple at (0,2) (2 steps left and 2 up).\n\n**RIGHT to (4,0):**\n- Next turn from (4,0): possible moves: UP (4,1) (our own body segment), DOWN (4,-1) (off board), LEFT (3,0) (our body), RIGHT (5,0) (empty). So only safe move: RIGHT.\n- Also, we are closer to the center and might have access to other apples later.\n\nComparing:\n- LEFT gives two safe moves next turn (UP and LEFT) and moves toward apple (0,2).\n- RIGHT gives only one safe move next turn (RIGHT) and is away from immediate apples.\n\nSo LEFT is clearly better: more options next turn and paths toward an apple.\n\n**Long-term plan note:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (2,0), next turn we can go UP to (2,1) or LEFT to (1,0). The apple at (0,2) is two steps away (need to go left then up, or up then left). Also, we should be aware of enemy #1 which is still small and not a threat yet. We can continue to collect apples safely.\n\nTherefore, choose LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

Moves closer to (9, 5). Distance decreases to 2.\n\n3.  **Safety & Strategy:**\n    *   The enemy snake is at y=1. Moving UP to y=6 ensures I am effectively out of their immediate movement range for this turn (they can move to y=2 max). However, I am currently on a clear path at y=5 to an apple.\n    *   Moving RIGHT maintains the fastest path to the apple at (9, 5).\n    *   While the enemy is alive, they are at distance 3 Manhattan. If I stay on the x-axis y=5, they could theoretically try to intercept at x=2..3 range if I were lower, but here I am at x=6.\n    *   The direct path RIGHT to (9, 5) is clear.\n    *   Moving UP is safer but sacrifices the immediate apple opportunity.\n    *   I will gamble on the direct path for speed. The board is clear ahead at y=5, x=7, 8, 9.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving RIGHT provides the shortest path to a valuable apple while remaining safe.\n\nRIGHT",

The previous move rationale stated the head was at (8, 5) and moved **RIGHT**. Given that the visual board shows '1' at (9, 5) and 'A' at (8, 5), and the previous move was **RIGHT**, I must trust the visual board and the consequence of the move. I am currently at **(9, 5)**.\n\n2.  **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   **Head:** (0, 2)\n    *   **Body:** [(1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0)]\n    *   Distance: ~9-10 turns away from my head.

The nearest apples are (9, 1) (distance 4) and (8, 2) (distance 4).\n\n4.  **Board Constraints:**\n    *   I am at the far right edge of the board (x=9). This limits my movement options.\n\n**Move Evaluation (Current Head: (9, 5)):**\n\n*   **UP (9, 6):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   *Long-term check:* From (9, 6), I can access the top right area. However, to chase apples at (9, 1) or (8, 2), I would have to turn back DOWN. If I go UP too far, I risk boxing myself in the corner.\n*   **DOWN (9, 4):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   *Long-term check:* Moves me towards (9, 1). Good direction to start collecting the nearby apples.\n*   **LEFT (8, 5):** Contains an 'A' (Apple). Safe.\n    *   *Risk:* This is the cell I just came from (assuming the previous move from 8,5 to 9,5). Moving back is moving into my own body (specifically, the neck).\n    *   *Rule Reference:* \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n    *   *Visual Check:* The board shows 'A' at (8, 5). If I eat the apple, the snake usually grows. But wait, the 'A' is still there in the visual representation. If I move there, I definitely hit my body (which is at (8,5)).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Moving LEFT is invalid/deadly.\n*   **RIGHT:** Off board. Dead.\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nThe safest moves are UP or DOWN.\n*   Moving **UP** takes me to the top row (9, 6). The only apple accessible from that corner is (5, 9), which is very far (delta x=4, y=3). Chasing (5, 9) might be dangerous later as I am in a corner.\n*   Moving **DOWN** takes me to (9, 4). This is on the path to the cluster of apples at (9, 1) and (8, 2).\n*   Comparing the two: Moving DOWN keeps me closer to multiple apples (3 apples in the bottom half vs 1 in the top half). Also, staying on the right edge is risky; moving down allows me to eventually turn LEFT into the board.\n\nI will move DOWN to start the descent towards the apples at y=1 and y=2.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (9, 4) to set up for collecting the apples at (9, 1) and (8, 2). Avoid getting trapped in the top right corner.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state after the last move.\n\n**Current State:**\n- My head is at (0, 2) (just moved LEFT to eat the apple at (0,2)).\n- My body: [(1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0)] (length 5, since we just grew to 5 segments? Actually, we had 4 segments and ate an apple, so now we have 5 segments. But the tail hasn't moved yet? Actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, you grow by one segment at the end of the move. So the tail remains in place for this turn. Next turn, the tail will move normally unless we eat another apple.\nBut for the current state: \n  - Head: (0,2)\n  - Body segments: (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0)  [so 4 body segments + head = total length 5]\n- Apples collected: now 5 (since we just ate one, previously 4).\n- Apples remaining: (8,2), (9,1), (5,9), (6,5), (5,5) [we just ate (0,2), so it should be removed? But in the provided state, apples are listed as (8,2), (9,1), (5,9), (6,5), (5,5). So (0,2) is gone.\n\n**Enemy snake #1:**\n- Head: (9,5)\n- Body: [(8,5)]\n- Apples: 1\n\n**Possible moves from current head (0,2):**\n- UP: (0,3) - check: empty? From board: at (0,3): no snake, no wall. Safe.\n- DOWN: (0,1) - empty? (0,1) is empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: (-1,2) - off board (x=-1 invalid). Not safe.\n- RIGHT: (1,2) - this is my own body segment (the first body part). So unsafe.\n\nSo only safe moves: UP and DOWN.\n\nNow, consider next moves after each:\n\n**UP to (0,3):**\n- Then from (0,3), possible moves next turn:\n  - UP: (0,4) - empty\n  - DOWN: (0,2) - but (0,2) is currently empty? But after we move, our tail will move? Actually, next turn, when we move from (0,3), our tail will advance: the tail (2,0) will move to (2,1)? Actually, the entire body shifts: head moves to (0,3), then each segment moves to the previous position. So the body becomes: [ (0,3), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1) ] and the tail (2,0) is gone? Wait, we have length 5, so we have 5 segments including head. After moving without eating, the tail moves away.\nSo after moving UP to (0,3) without eating:\n   New head: (0,3)\n   Body: [ (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1) ]   (tail is (2,1))\nSo from (0,3) next turn, adjacent:\n   UP: (0,4) - empty\n   DOWN: (0,2) - my body (the neck) - unsafe\n   LEFT: off board\n   RIGHT: (1,3) - empty\nSo only UP and RIGHT would be safe. That is manageable.\n\n**DOWN to (0,1):**\n- Then from (0,1), next turn:\n   After moving: head at (0,1), body: [ (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1) ] (tail at (2,1))\nAdjacent:\n   UP: (0,2) - my body (unsafe)\n   DOWN: (0,0) - empty\n   LEFT: off board\n   RIGHT: (1,1) - empty\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT safe.\n\nSo both UP and DOWN lead to having two safe moves next turn.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\nThe closest apples are (8,2), (9,1), (5,9), (6,5), (5,5). All are far away. So no immediate apple to chase.\n\n**Enemy threat:**\nSnake #1 at (9,5) is far. It might go for (9,1) or (8,2) or (5,5) or (6,5). Not an immediate threat.\n\n**Strategy:**\nWe need to avoid getting trapped in the left edge. From (0,2), we have only UP and DOWN. We should choose a direction that opens more options for the future.\n\n- UP to (0,3): then we can go UP to (0,4) or RIGHT to (1,3). This moves us toward the top-left, which has more space.\n- DOWN to (0,1): then we can go DOWN to (0,0) or RIGHT to (1,1). This moves to bottom-left, which is a corner.\n\nThe top-left (0,3) has more upward potential (to y=4,5,...) and right to (1,3). The bottom-left (0,1) leads to (0,0) which is a dead end with only one exit (RIGHT to (1,0)), which is riskier.\n\nSo UP is better to avoid the bottom corner.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**\nIf we go UP to (0,3), next turn we should avoid DOWN (which is body). So we can go UP to (0,4) or RIGHT to (1,3). Prefer RIGHT to (1,3) to get away from the left wall and open more options.\n\nTherefore, choose UP now.\n\n**Final decision:** UP\n\nUP",

Actually, (5,5): dx=4, dy=2, total=6; (6,5): dx=5, dy=2, total=7). (8,2): dx=7, dy=-1? Actually, |8-1|+|2-3|=7+1=8. (9,1): dx=8, dy=-2? |9-1|+|1-3|=8+2=10. (5,9): dx=4, dy=6, total=10.\nSo (5,5) is closest at distance 6.\n\nMoving RIGHT gets me to (2,3), which is closer to (5,5) (distance now |5-2|+|5-3|=3+2=5).\nMoving UP to (1,4) is slightly farther? |5-1|+|5-4|=4+1=5? Same Manhattan distance? Actually, (1,4) to (5,5): dx=4, dy=1, total=5. So both moves reduce the distance equally? But RIGHT moves horizontally closer.\n\n**Enemy threat:**\nSnake #1 is at (9,3).

RIGHT moves me horizontally towards the apples (5,5) and (6,5). UP moves me vertically, but also towards the top where there is an apple at (5,9). However, (5,9) is farther.\n\nGiven that I have two safe moves, both with good future options, I prefer RIGHT because it moves me more directly towards the cluster of apples at (5,5) and (6,5). Also, moving RIGHT avoids the left edge, which is more constrained.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT is chosen to move towards the apples and center.\n\n**Note for future self:**\nContinue moving towards the center (apples at (5,5) and (6,5)). Avoid getting trapped on edges. Watch for enemy #1, which is currently on the right side but not near me.\n\nRIGHT",

It cannot reach (9,1) or (8,2) in the next turn.\n    *   Let's prioritize the move that leaves me with the most space.\n    *   If I go DOWN (to 9,1), I am at y=1. I can still move DOWN to 9,0 or LEFT to 8,1. I have plenty of space.\n    *   If I go LEFT (to 8,2), I am at y=2. I can move DOWN to 8,1, LEFT to 7,2, etc.\n    *   Both seem good. I will pick one.\n    *   The apple at (9,1) is \"lower\" on the board. Let's secure the lower apple first.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to eat the apple at (9,1).

Safe.  \n- **DOWN** (2, 2): Check board \u2014 appears empty (my old tail was at (2, 2) but it's no longer in my body after moving to (2, 3) last turn). Yes, snake body is now [(2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2)], so (2, 2) is free. Wait, but did I grow? No \u2014 apples collected is 4, same as previous turn. Actually, checking: last turn I collected an apple? No \u2014 current apples still five, I had 4 apples last turn too. So length stays same \u2014 when moving, tail moves, so (2, 2) is now empty. Yes, safe.  \n- **LEFT** (1, 3): Neck \u2014 unsafe.  \n- **RIGHT** (3, 3): Empty \u2014 safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n**Next turn safety:**  \n- **UP (2,4)**: From there, my body will be [(2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2)]; tail (1,2) gone. Surrounding: (2,5), (1,4), (3,4) all empty. Only (2,3) is neck? But moving DOWN from (2,4) is (2,3) which is in the new body (second segment)? Yes \u2014 so DOWN would be unsafe next turn. But UP, LEFT, RIGHT would be safe. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n- **DOWN (2,2)**: Body becomes [(2,2), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2)]; tail (1,2) gone. Surrounding: (2,1), (1,2), (3,2). Note (1,2) is in body? Yes, at the tail end? Actually body segments: (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2). So (1,2) is NOT occupied \u2014 check: the tail was (1,2) but after moving to (2,2) and adding head, tail (1,2) is dropped. Actually wait: current body length is 5 segments: [(2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (1,2)]. When we move to (2,2): new head at (2,2), then first four segments of old body: (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2) \u2014 tail (1,2) is dropped. So (1,2) is free. So from (2,2): UP (2,3) is neck \u2014 unsafe. DOWN (2,1) safe. LEFT (1,2) safe. RIGHT (3,2) safe. So 3 safe moves again.  \n- **RIGHT (3,3)**: Body: [(3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2)]; tail (1,2) dropped. Surrounding: (3,4), (2,3) neck, (4,3), (3,2) empty. So LEFT unsafe, others safe \u2014 3 safe moves.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple: (6,5) and (5,5) \u2014 Manhattan distance from (2,3):  \n- (6,5): |6-2| + |5-3| = 4 + 2 = 6  \n- (5,5): 3 + 2 = 5  \nFrom (2,4): (5,5) \u2192 3 + 1 = 4  \nFrom (2,2): (5,5) \u2192 3 + 3 = 6  \nFrom (3,3): (5,5) \u2192 2 + 2 = 4  \n\nSo UP and RIGHT equally reduce distance to nearest apple cluster.  \n\n**Enemy snake #1** at (9,2):  \nIts body: [(9,3)] \u2014 likely will move towards apple (9,1) or (8,2). Not an immediate threat.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nAvoid getting stuck near edges \u2014 currently near left edge but not trapped. UP and RIGHT both good for accessing center apples. RIGHT moves horizontally toward apples and center, UP moves vertically. Given equal apple distance reduction, prefer RIGHT to move horizontally away from left edge and toward more open space.  \n\n**Final choice:** RIGHT keeps options open and progresses toward apples.  \n\nRIGHT",

It can move UP (8,2) \u2014 which has an apple, DOWN (8,0) \u2014 off board (dies), LEFT (7,1) \u2014 empty, or RIGHT (9,1) \u2014 its own body (unsafe). So it will likely choose UP or LEFT. If it goes UP to (8,2), it eats the apple and grows. It might also go LEFT to (7,1) to avoid the edge? But UP is tempting.\n\n**Apple priorities:**\nClosest apples to me: (5,5) and (6,5) are both at Manhattan distance |5-4|+|5-3|=1+2=3, and |6-4|+|5-3|=2+2=4. Also (4,9) is |4-4|+|9-3|=0+6=6.\nSo (5,5) is closest.\n\nFrom my head (4,3):\n- UP (4,4): then to (5,5) is |5-4|+|5-4|=1+1=2.\n- DOWN (4,2): then to (5,5) is |5-4|+|5-2|=1+3=4.\n- RIGHT (5,3): then to (5,5) is |5-5|+|5-3|=0+2=2.\n\nSo UP and RIGHT equally good for approaching (5,5).\n\n**Future mobility:**\n- UP (4,4): neck at (4,3), so next moves: UP (4,5), LEFT (3,4), RIGHT (5,4). All seem safe for now.\n- DOWN (4,2): neck at (4,3), so next moves: DOWN (4,1), LEFT (3,2), RIGHT (5,2). Also all safe.\n- RIGHT (5,3): neck at (4,3), so next moves: UP (5,4), DOWN (5,2), RIGHT (6,3). All safe.\n\nAll three options have good mobility.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nI want to approach the apple cluster at (5,5) and (6,5). Moving UP or RIGHT helps. Also, I should avoid the enemy. The enemy is likely to go UP to (8,2) for the apple, which is far from me. So no immediate threat.\n\nHowever, note that the board has many apples on the top row (5,9) and (4,9). But those are farther.\n\n**Decision:**\nBetween UP and RIGHT, both are equally good. But RIGHT moves me horizontally toward the center and the apples. Also, my body is along the left edge (from (0,3) to (3,3)), so moving RIGHT opens more space.\n\nI'll choose RIGHT to continue moving toward the apples.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nHead towards (5,5) and (6,5). After RIGHT to (5,3), next turn I can go UP to (5,4) to get closer to (5,5). Avoid the enemy which is on the right side \u2014 but currently not a threat.\n\nRIGHT",

Eating it would grow me.\n- **DOWN:** (5, 3) \u2014 My own body (neck) \u2014 unsafe.\n- **LEFT:** (4, 4) \u2014 Currently empty.\n- **RIGHT:** (6, 4) \u2014 Currently empty.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Immediate Apple Opportunity:**\nUP leads directly to an apple at (5, 5). This is the best immediate reward, increasing my score to 5.\n\n**Safety Check for UP:**\n- Is (5, 5) safe? It's just an apple, no snake body is there.\n- What about enemy movement? Enemy head is at (8, 3). It can move UP to (8, 4) (apple), DOWN to (8, 2) (its body), LEFT to (7, 3) (empty), RIGHT to (9, 3) (empty).\n- The enemy cannot reach (5, 5) in one move. The closest it could get is to (7, 3) or (8, 4), which are not adjacent to my target.\n- No risk of head-on collision at (5, 5).\n\n**Future Mobility after UP:**\nIf I eat the apple at (5, 5), my new head will be there, and my body will grow to 5 segments. My next moves from (5, 5) would be:\n- UP to (5, 6) \u2014 empty.\n- DOWN to (5, 4) \u2014 my new neck (safe, as it's the old head).\n- LEFT to (4, 5) \u2014 empty.\n- RIGHT to (6, 5) \u2014 another apple!\nSo from (5, 5), I have three safe moves, including a direct path to another apple at (6, 5).

Not optimal.\n- RIGHT to (6, 4): Puts me closer to (6, 5), but skips the immediate apple at (5, 5). This is less efficient.\n\n**Enemy Threat:**\nThe enemy is on the right side, near the apple at (8, 4). It might move there, but that doesn't threaten me at (5, 5). We are far apart.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nUP is the best move. It secures an apple, increases my lead, and sets me up for the next apple at (6, 5). It is safe and optimal.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating (5, 5), target (6, 5). Then assess the board. Avoid moving towards the enemy's area unnecessarily.

Eating apple at `(6, 5)` would grow me further.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Analyzing safe moves:**\n- RIGHT: gets me an apple immediately \u2014 boosts score to 6, and enemy is far enough away that they can\u2019t reach `(6, 5)` in one turn unless they move there, but currently enemy head is at `(8, 4)`, which is 2 cells away (Manhattan distance 3 = not possible one move). Wait \u2014 Manhattan distance from `(8, 4)` to `(6, 5)` is |8-6|+|4-5| = 2+1=3, so safe from collision. However, they could move towards apples `(4,9)` area but not near `(6,5)` yet.\n- UP: moves toward apple `(5, 9)` eventually but not immediate reward.\n- LEFT: moves toward apples `(4,9)`/`(4,8)` but slightly less direct.\n\n**Enemy\u2019s possible moves from `(8, 4)`:**\nEnemy\u2019s possible destinations: UP `(8, 5)` empty, DOWN `(8, 3)` its body (unsafe), LEFT `(7, 4)` empty, RIGHT `(9, 4)` empty. Enemy will likely go UP toward apples at top or avoid death. They could threaten `(4,9)` later but not next turn vs `(6, 5)`.\n\n**Best choice:**  \nRIGHT gets immediate apple, puts me at `(6, 5)` with follow-up options possibly toward `(5, 9)` or `(4, 9)` afterward. It\u2019s safe and increases lead.  \n\n**Future plan:** After eating `(6, 5)`, avoid getting trapped near enemy. Possibly head top-left toward cluster `(4, 9)` next, but check enemy movement then.\n\nRIGHT",

No immediate collision.\n        *   Result: **SAFE**.\n    *   **DOWN:** Target (8, 3).\n        *   Board Check: `(8, 3)` is occupied by my own body.\n        *   Result: **DEATH**.\n    *   **LEFT:** Target (7, 4).\n        *   Board Check: `(7, 4)` is `.` (Empty).\n        *   Result: **SAFE**.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Target (9, 4).\n        *   Board Check: `(9, 4)` is `.` (Empty).\n        *   Result: **SAFE**.\n\n3.  **Strategy:**\n    *   I ate the apple at (8, 4) last turn. My tail will remain at (9, 1) this turn because I didn't grow (I assume), or if I did grow, the tail stays until I move again. Actually, since I ate, I grew. My body is now effectively [(8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1), (9, 1)] -> head at (8, 4). Wait, if I ate, I didn't cut my tail. So the body remains as listed in the prompt. The prompt gives the state *after* my move (since it includes the new head position (8,4) and the apples).\n    *   The Enemy #0 is at (5, 5). He has 5 apples and is quite long (6 segments including head).\n    *   Apples at the top: (5,9), (4,9), (4,8) are clustered. (6,5) is nearby to the right. (0,7) is far left.\n    *   To reach the top cluster, I need to go UP.\n    *   To reach (6,5), I need to go RIGHT.\n    *   **Checking (6,5):** It is currently empty (based on the board state `.` at (6,5)). The apple list says (6,5) is an apple. The board grid shows `A` at (5,5) and (6,5) is `.` in the provided text. Let me re-read the board.\n        *   Row 5: `. . . . . 0 A . . .`\n        *   Column indices 0-9.\n        *   (5,5) is `0`. (6,5) is `A`.\n        *   The board state text says: `5 . . . . . 0 A . . .`\n        *   So (6,5) is an Apple. My current head is (8,4).\n        *   If I move RIGHT to (9,4), I am further from both the top cluster and (6,5).\n        *   If I move UP to (8,5), I am closer to the top cluster and still equidistant to (6,5) horizontally (2 steps away).\n        *   If I move LEFT to (7,4), I start heading towards the left and top.\n        *   Let's look at the gap. My body is a vertical line at x=8. I have (8,5) open.\n        *   The Enemy #0 is at (5,5). He might go for (6,5) (to his right) or (5,6) (up).\n        *   If I go UP, I secure the vertical lane.\n        *   If I go RIGHT, I turn 90 degrees. My tail is at (9,1). If I go (8,4)->(9,4), my body becomes [(8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (9,1)].\n        *   If I go UP, my body becomes [(8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (9,1)].\n        *   Let's evaluate the \"future options\" of UP vs LEFT vs RIGHT.\n        *   **UP (8,5):** From here I can go UP to (8,6) -> (8,7) -> (8,8) -> (8,9). This path is mostly clear (Row 8 has apples at y=8 and y=9). Row 9 is blocked by wall. Row 7 has an apple at (0,7). Row 8 has apple at (4,8).\n        *   **LEFT (7,4):** Opens up movement to the left side.\n        *   **RIGHT (9,4):** Moves me to the right wall.\n    *   Let's look at the apple at (6,5). It is 2 steps away if I go RIGHT twice. Or 2 steps away if I go UP then RIGHT.\n    *   However, the Enemy Head is at (5,5). He is adjacent to (6,5). He will almost certainly try to eat (6,5) if it's safe for him.\n    *   If the Enemy eats (6,5), I shouldn't aim for it if it puts me in danger.\n    *   Let's look at the top cluster: (5,9), (4,9), (4,8).\n    *   To get there:\n        *   UP (8,5) -> UP (8,6) -> LEFT (7,6) ... etc.\n    *   Let's check the safety of UP.\n        *   (8,5) is empty.\n        *   Is it a trap?\n        *   Up at (8,6): empty (Row 6 is all dots).\n        *   Up at (8,7): Row 7 has an apple at (0,7) but (8,7) is empty.\n        *   Up at (8,8): Row 8 has apples at (4,8) and (8,8)? No, the list says (4,8) is an apple. The board shows (8,8) is empty.\n        *   Wait, the board shows Row 8: `. . . . A . . . . .`\n        *   (4,8) is an apple. (8,8) is empty.\n        *   So going UP seems to open up a long vertical tunnel.\n    *   The Enemy at (5,5) is at the same Y-level as my head. If I go UP, I move away from him.\n    *   If I go LEFT, I move towards him (same Y-level).\n    *   If I go UP, I increase my Y distance.\n    *   The apples at the top are valuable.\n    *   Let's check if (8,5) is definitely safe.\n        *   My body: (8,3), (8,2)... My tail is at (9,1).\n        *   Enemy Body: (5,4)...\n        *   Enemy cannot reach (8,5) in one turn (max range is 1).\n        *   Enemy might move UP to (5,6). That doesn't affect me.\n        *   Enemy might move RIGHT to (6,5) (apple).\n        *   If I go UP, I am at (8,5).\n        *   If I go UP, next turn I have (8,6), (7,5), (9,5) available.\n        *   (8,6) is definitely empty.\n        *   (7,5) is empty (Row 5: `(7,5)` is `.`).\n        *   (9,5) is empty.\n        *   So UP gives me 3 safe moves next turn (unless the enemy moves into one, but he is far).\n        *   LEFT to (7,4): Next turn options (7,5), (6,4), (7,3).\n        *   (7,3) is empty.\n        *   (6,4) is empty.\n        *   (7,5) is empty.\n        *   RIGHT to (9,4): Next turn options (9,5), (8,4), (9,3).\n        *   (8,4) is my body next turn (if I grew? No, wait. If I didn't grow since last turn, or if I did...)\n        *   Actually, I ate an apple last turn. So my tail didn't move this turn.\n        *   If I move to (8,5), my body becomes: Head (8,5) -> (8,4) -> (8,3) -> (8,2) -> (8,1).\n        *   My tail stays at (9,1) because I ate.\n        *   Wait, the prompt says \"Snake #1... Head: (8,4)\". This is the state *after* my last move (UP).\n        *   So I am currently at (8,4).\n        *   I need to move to (8,5), (7,4), or (9,4).\n        *   If I move UP to (8,5):\n            *   My body becomes: [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (9,1)].\n        *   If I move LEFT to (7,4):\n            *   My body becomes: [(7,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (9,1)].\n        *   If I move RIGHT to (9,4):\n            *   My body becomes: [(9,4), (8,3), (8,2), (8,1), (9,1)].\n        *   The (9,1) tail stays because I haven't eaten *this* turn (yet). I only grow when I land on an apple.\n        *   The apples are at (5,9), (6,5), (4,9), (0,7), (4,8). None of the adjacent cells contain apples.\n        *   So I will not grow this turn. My tail will remain at (9,1).\n        *   This makes (9,1) a permanent obstacle for 1 more turn.\n        *   If I go UP: My body occupies y=4,3,2,1 at x=8, and (9,1).\n        *   Next turn: (8,5) head. (8,4)... etc.\n        *   If I go UP, I am moving towards the top.\n        *   Is there any reason NOT to go UP?\n        *   Enemy at (5,5). He might intercept if I try to go for (6,5). But I am going UP.\n        *   The board size is 10x10.\n        *   Let's look at the enemy path.\n        *   Enemy Head (5,5). Body: (5,4), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3).\n        *   If I go UP, I am safe.\n        *   If I go LEFT, I am safe.\n        *   If I go RIGHT, I am safe.\n        *   Let's consider the \"goal\". Win condition is 50 apples or last snake standing.\n        *   I have 4 apples. Enemy has 5.\n        *   The apples are the objective.\n        *   Top apples: (5,9), (4,9), (4,8).\n        *   To get there:\n        *   Path via UP: (8,5) -> (8,6) -> (8,7) -> (8,8) -> (8,9) (Wall).\n        *   Actually, I need to turn left to get to (5,9).\n        *   So (8,5) -> (7,5) -> (6,5) -> (5,6) -> (5,7)...\n        *   If I go UP now, I save the (8,5) spot.\n        *   If I go LEFT now, I am at (7,4). From there I can go to (7,5) then (6,5).\n        *   (6,5) is an apple. Enemy is at (5,5).\n        *   If I am at (7,4), I can go to (6,4) then (6,5).\n        *   If I am at (8,5), I can go to (7,5) then (6,5).\n        *   The enemy at (5,5) can go to (6,5).\n        *   If the enemy goes to (6,5), and I try to go to (6,5), we head-on collision (both die). I should avoid that.\n        *   However, (6,5) is empty *right now* (according to board state text `.` at (6,5) in row 5).\n        *   Row 5: `. . . . . 0 A . . .` -> Index 0 is `.`, 1 is `.`, 2 is `.`, 3 is `.`, 4 is `.`, 5 is `0`, 6 is `A`.\n        *   So (6,5) is an apple.\n        *   Enemy at (5,5).\n        *   Me at (8,4).\n        *   If I go UP to (8,5), next turn I can go LEFT to (7,5) and then LEFT to (6,5). That takes 2 turns to reach (6,5).\n        *   The enemy can reach (6,5) in 1 turn by moving RIGHT.\n        *   So (6,5) will likely be eaten by enemy.\n        *   If I go LEFT to (7,4), I can go LEFT to (6,4) then UP to (6,5) in 2 turns.\n        *   Same timing.\n        *   If I go LEFT to (7,4), I am closer to the (4,8) and (4,9) apples.\n        *   (4,8) is at x=4, y=8.\n        *   Current: (8,4).\n        *   Path UP: (8,5) -> (7,5) -> (6,5) -> (5,6) -> (4,7) -> (4,8). (approx 5 turns).\n        *   Path LEFT: (7,4) -> (6,4) -> (5,4) -> (4,4) -> (4,5) -> (4,6) -> (4,7) -> (4,8). (approx 7 turns).\n        *   So UP is faster for the top cluster?\n        *   Wait, (5,9) is at top. (4,9).\n        *   UP path: (8,5) -> (7,6) -> (6,7) -> (5,8) -> (5,9).\n        *   (7,6) is empty (Row 6 all dots).\n        *   (6,7) is empty.\n        *   (5,8) is an apple? No, (4,8) is apple. (5,8) is empty (Row 8 has apple at (4,8) only).\n        *   So (5,9) is the target.\n        *   Path UP: (8,5) -> (8,6) -> (7,7) -> (6,8) -> (5,9).\n        *   (6,8) is empty (Row 8 has apple at (4,8) only).\n        *   This is 4 moves.\n        *   Enemy is at (5,5). Distance to (5,9) is 4 moves (UP UP UP UP).\n        *   I am at (8,4). Distance is 4 moves.\n        *   We are equal distance.\n        *   If I go UP now, I am on track.\n        *   If I go LEFT, I lose ground.\n        *   If I go RIGHT, I lose ground.\n        *   So UP seems correct to contest the top apples.\n        *   Is (8,5) safe?\n        *   Yes.\n        *   Is there any trap?\n        *   Enemy could try to cut me off. But he is at (5,5). I am at (8,5).\n        *   If I go UP, I leave him behind.\n        *   Let's double check the board state for traps.\n        *   My tail is at (9,1).\n        *   If I go UP, I am at (8,5).\n        *   Next turn I can go (8,6), (7,5), (9,5).\n        *   (9,5) is near the right wall.\n        *   (7,5) is towards the center.\n        *   (8,6) is straight up.\n        *   All seem open.\n        *   Let's check (7,4) again.\n        *   If I go LEFT to (7,4), I am on the same Y as (8,4).\n        *   Enemy is at (5,5).

If he goes to (6,5), (6,4) is safe (under him).\n        *   So both are viable.\n        *   But UP puts me closer to the top prize (5,9).\n        *   (5,9) is worth more than (6,5) because there are two apples there ((5,9), (4,9)).\n        *   Also, (4,8) is there.\n        *   So the top cluster is the high value target.\n        *   I should prioritize getting there.\n        *   Therefore, UP is the strategic move.\n        *   Let's confirm (8,5) is empty. Yes.\n        *   Let's confirm no enemy can hit (8,5). Max range is 1. Enemy at (5,5). No.\n        *   Let's confirm I don't hit myself. My body is (8,3), (8,2)... No.\n        *   Let's confirm I don't hit my tail. My tail is (9,1). No.\n        *   Let's confirm I don't hit enemy body. Enemy body is mostly on X=5 or lower. No.\n        *   So UP is safe and optimal.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to secure the vertical path towards the top apple cluster ((5,9), (4,9), (4,8)). Monitor the enemy's movement towards (6,5); if he takes it, avoid the adjacent cells. Aim to reach the top row safely.\n\nUP",

So RIGHT is potentially dangerous \u2014 consider risk.\n\n**Risk assessment:**  \nEnemy could go UP to (8, 6) toward apples (5, 9)/(4, 9) or RIGHT (9, 5) to avoid collision, but it might also go LEFT to (7, 5) if they don\u2019t see danger?

Enemy is at (8, 5) so they might go UP (8, 6) and then LEFT to (7, 6), (6, 6), etc., toward that cluster \u2014 so I should race them.  \n\nSo safest and most strategic: UP now, then likely LEFT next turn to approach apple cluster.

Tail at (8, 3).\n*   **Potential Moves:**\n    *   **UP** (8, 8): Empty `.`. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN** (8, 6): Occupied by my own body. Unsafe.\n    *   **LEFT** (7, 7): Empty `.`. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT** (9, 7): Empty `.`. Safe.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n1.  **Apple Priority:** The cluster at **(5,9)**, **(4,9)**, and **(4,8)** remains the primary target. There is also an apple at **(0,7)**, but the top cluster is closer and denser.\n2.  **Pathing to Top Cluster:**\n    *   Last turn, I moved **UP** to (8,7). My next step towards the cluster should be to move **LEFT** towards the left wall (x=0), as the apples are at x=4 and x=5.\n    *   **LEFT** to (7,7) is the correct vector. From there, continuing Left to (6,7) brings me closer.\n    *   Moving **UP** to (8,8) or **RIGHT** to (9,7) moves me away from the target apples, requiring more turns later to correct course.\n3.  **Enemy Awareness:**\n    *   Enemy #0 is at (6, 7). If I move **LEFT** to (7, 7), I will be adjacent to the enemy at (6, 7).\n    *   **Risk Assessment:** The enemy's head is currently at (6,7). They might move UP to (6,8), LEFT to (5,7), or DOWN to (6,6).\n        *   If they move **UP**, they are safe, and I am at (7,7).\n        *   If they move **LEFT**, they go to (5,7), leaving (6,7) empty. I would be at (7,7).\n        *   If they move **DOWN**, they go to (6,6). They would die because their body is at (6,6).\n    *   However, there is a risk they could move **RIGHT** to (7,7). This would result in a head-on collision, killing both of us. However, moving **RIGHT** puts the enemy's head at (7,7) which is adjacent to my body at (8,6) (diagonal, safe) and doesn't seem like a strong move for them to reach the apples. Given the lack of safe alternatives (Right is away from apples, Up is away from apples), proceeding with **LEFT** is the logical choice to advance the objective. The risk of a head-on collision is present but the enemy has no direct incentive to move into my path.\n4.  **Future Options:**\n    *   **LEFT** to (7,7) maintains a clear path to the top cluster.\n    *   **UP** to (8,8) or **RIGHT** to (9,7) moves me to the edge of the board, which can be restrictive in the long run.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n**LEFT** is the optimal move as it reduces the distance to the top apple cluster and aligns with the current trajectory. While it brings me adjacent to the enemy, the enemy's movement options limit the immediate collision risk, and the strategic gain of moving towards the apples outweighs the potential sidestep.\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Safe.\n    *   **DOWN** (7, 6): Empty `.`. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT** (6, 7): Currently occupied by Enemy #0's body (segment (6,7)). However, Enemy #0 will move this turn. Assuming they move forward (likely to (6,8) or (5,7)), the cell (6,7) will become vacant. Moving there is safe *unless* Enemy #0 moves into it from (6,6) or (7,7) moves into it. I am moving into it, so I occupy it.\n    *   **RIGHT** (8, 7): Occupied by my own body (segment (8,7)). Unsafe.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n1.  **Apple Priority:** The target remains the cluster at **(5,9)**, **(4,9)**, and **(4,8)**. The apple at **(0,7)** is further away.\n2.  **Pathing to Top Cluster:**\n    *   To reach the top cluster (x=4, y=9), I need to decrease my X coordinate (move Left) and increase my Y coordinate (move Up).\n    *   **LEFT** to (6,7) is the most direct vector. It reduces the distance to the cluster by 1 unit.\n    *   **UP** to (7,8) is also viable but moves me horizontally away from the apples (currently x=7 vs apples at x=4/5). However, moving Up avoids the interaction with the enemy at (6,7).\n    *   **DOWN** to (7,6) moves away from the apples and into a row that will be vacated by my tail, which is safe but non-optimal for scoring.\n3.  **Enemy Awareness:**\n    *   Enemy #0 is at (6, 8) (Head) and has a body segment at (6, 7).\n    *   If I move **LEFT** to (6,7), I am moving into the cell currently occupied by the enemy's body. This is safe as long as the enemy moves out of (6,7) or the head doesn't collide with me there.\n    *   The enemy will likely move UP to (6,9) (Apple at (5,9) is just right of there) or LEFT to (5,8).\n    *   If the enemy moves UP to (6,9), I move to (6,7). We are separated.\n    *   If the enemy moves LEFT to (5,8), I move to (6,7). We are separated.\n    *   If the enemy moves DOWN to (6,7) (backwards), they die.\n    *   The risk of a head-on collision exists if the enemy moves RIGHT to (7,7) while I move LEFT to (6,7). But that would require the enemy to turn into my current position, which is a suboptimal move for them given their proximity to apples to the left. Also, the cell (7,7) is where I am moving *from*. Wait, if I move Left to (6,7) and Enemy moves Right to (7,7), we swap heads? No, we collide in the sense that we cross paths? No, simultaneous movement: I end up at (6,7), Enemy ends up at (7,7). That is safe.\n    *   Actually, the dangerous collision is if Enemy moves Left from (6,8) to (6,7) and I move Left from (7,7) to (6,7). Both heads arrive at (6,7). Both die.\n    *   Where is the enemy likely to go?\n        *   Target apples: (5,9) and (4,9).\n        *   Enemy at (6,8). To reach (5,9), they should move UP (to 6,9) then LEFT (to 5,9). To reach (4,9), similar path.\n        *   To reach (0,7), they would move DOWN or LEFT.\n        *   Moving LEFT to (5,8) puts them adjacent to my body at (8,7)? No, (5,8) is far.\n        *   Moving UP seems the strongest move for them to claim the top-right apple (5,9).\n    *   If Enemy moves UP, I move LEFT. Safe.\n\n4.  **Comparison of Moves:**\n    *   **LEFT (6,7):** Moves towards apples (x-). Opens path to top. Possible collision if Enemy moves Left (unlikely).\n    *   **UP (7,8):** Moves towards apples (y+). Moves away from apples (x+). Safe from Enemy (Enemy is at (6,8), so (7,8) is adjacent). I would be at (7,8), Enemy at (6,8). If Enemy moves UP to (6,9), I could move UP to (7,9) next turn. This is a safe \"parallel\" path.\n    *   **DOWN (7,6):** Bad.\n\n**Decision:**\n**LEFT** is the optimal move to close the distance to the apple cluster. While there is a risk of collision if the enemy makes the specific move of going LEFT (into the wall/corner), the enemy is likely to go UP or LEFT to chase the apples. If they go LEFT to (5,8), we are safe. If they go UP to (6,9), we are safe.\nHowever, checking the board state again. The apple at (5,9) is very close to the enemy at (6,8).\nWait, the enemy at (6,8) is adjacent to the apple at (5,9). If the enemy moves LEFT to (5,8), they are adjacent to the apple at (4,8). If they move UP to (6,9), they are adjacent to the apple at (5,9).\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), I am putting my head directly below the enemy's potential path.\nIs there a safer option that maintains progress?\n**UP to (7,8)** keeps me at x=7, moving away from the cluster at x=4/5. But it puts me at y=8.\nLet's look at the path to (5,9).\nFrom (7,7):\nLeft to (6,7).\nIf Enemy moves UP to (6,8) -> (6,9), I move to (6,7). Next turn I can move UP to (6,8) and Left to (5,8).\nIf Enemy moves LEFT to (5,8), I move to (6,7). Next turn I can move UP to (6,8).\nIf I move UP to (7,8):\nI am at (7,8). Enemy at (6,8).\nIf Enemy moves UP to (6,9), I can move UP to (7,9). We are parallel. Next turn I can move LEFT to (6,9)? No, Enemy is there. I move LEFT to (6,9)? No. I must move LEFT to (6,9) only if empty.\nActually, moving UP keeps me safe from \"running into\" the enemy's body which is currently at (6,7).\nThe enemy's body is at (6,7). If I move LEFT to (6,7), I am moving into a cell that was just vacated by the enemy's tail (assuming they moved forward last turn)? No, look at history.\nWait, the enemy head is at (6,8). The body segment (6,7) exists.\nIf I move LEFT to (6,7), I am stepping into the path of the enemy. If the enemy moves DOWN to (6,7), we collide. If the enemy moves LEFT to (5,8), they leave (6,7) and I step into it.\nThe enemy is at (6,8). The target apples are (5,9) and (4,9).\nThe enemy will likely move UP to (6,9) to get closer to (5,9).\nIf the enemy moves UP, I am safe to move LEFT to (6,7).\nHowever, there is a risk the enemy moves LEFT to (5,8).\nIf Enemy moves LEFT to (5,8), I move to (6,7). Safe.\nIs there any scenario where moving LEFT is fatal?\nIf Enemy moves DOWN to (6,7), we collide. Why would they move DOWN?\nThey might move DOWN to eat the apple at (0,7)? No, that's far.\nThey might move DOWN to escape? No, they have a clear path up.\nThe apple at (5,9) is right there.\nI will proceed with **LEFT**.\n\nLong-term plan: Navigate to the top-left cluster (5,9), (4,9), (4,8). Be cautious of the enemy at (6,8). Use the left wall as a barrier if needed.\n\nLEFT",
