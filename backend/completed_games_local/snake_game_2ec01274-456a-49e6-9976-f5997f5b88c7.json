Enemy snake #1 has head at (7,2) and body at (7,3) (so it is 2 segments long). \n\nPossible moves from (3,3):\n- UP: (3,4) - empty\n- DOWN: (3,2) - empty\n- LEFT: (2,3) - empty\n- RIGHT: (4,3) - empty\n\nAll moves are safe because I have no body to collide with, and no other snake is adjacent to these cells. However, we must also consider where the enemy might move.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (7,2) with body at (7,3). It cannot move backwards into its own body at (7,3), so it cannot go UP. Its possible moves are:\n- DOWN: (7,1) - safe\n- LEFT: (6,2) - safe\n- RIGHT: (8,2) - safe\n\nNow, let's evaluate which apple to target. The closest apple is at (5,4) which is 2 steps right and 1 up. Also, (4,7) is 1 right and 4 up, and (3,9) is 6 up. Since I am at (3,3), moving UP gets me closer to (3,9) and also toward (4,7). However, (5,4) is very close.\n\nBut note: the enemy snake is at (7,2) and might also be heading for (5,4) or (6,6). Since it has already collected one apple, it is longer and more dangerous.\n\nTo avoid potential conflicts with the enemy, I should initially go for apples that are farther from it. (3,9) is far from the enemy and directly above me. Moving UP repeatedly would get me there safely.\n\nHowever, moving UP now to (3,4) is safe and progresses toward that apple. From there, I can continue UP or possibly go RIGHT later to get (4,7) or (5,4).\n\nAlso, consider the board: moving DOWN to (3,2) is safe but takes me away from most apples. LEFT to (2,3) is safe but also away. RIGHT to (4,3) is safe and gets me closer to (5,4) and (4,7), but also closer to the enemy.\n\nGiven that the enemy is at (7,2) and likely to move toward (6,2) or (7,1) (possibly to get the apple at (6,0) or (6,6)), moving RIGHT might bring me into its path in future turns. Therefore, it is safer to move UP toward (3,9), which is isolated.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue moving UP toward (3,9). After reaching (3,4), next turn I can go UP again to (3,5), then (3,6), etc. This path is clear and away from the enemy. Once I have grown a bit, I can consider other apples. Avoid moving right until necessary to avoid getting too close to snake #1.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move.\n\nUP",
