No body yet.\n- **Apples**: At (2, 7), (5, 2), (1, 1), (2, 5), (9, 5)\n- **Board size**: 10x10 (0 to 9 in both x and y)\n\n#### Step 1: Possible moves and immediate safety\nOur head is at (2, 8). Valid directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- **UP**: (2, 9). On board, no body, no snake head. \u2705\n- **DOWN**: (2, 7). Apple there. On board. No body. No snake head. \u2705\n- **LEFT**: (1, 8). On board. No body. No snake head. \u2705\n- **RIGHT**: (3, 8). On board. No body. No snake head. \u2705\n\nAll four moves are safe for now. No immediate death risk.\n\n#### Step 2: Pick strategically among safe moves\nWe want to:\n1. Eat apples.\n2. Avoid enemy snake and not get trapped.\n\nLet's see each option in context:\n\n- **DOWN to (2,7)**: Eat an apple immediately. Tail will be added at (2,8), so next turn our body will be [(2,8),(2,8)] \u2014 wait no, the tail doesn\u2019t spawn until *after* the move. We move first, then if we ate an apple the body segment is added where we were. We were at (2,8), that segment becomes the body. So after move, we\u2019ll be at (2,7) with body segment at (2,8). Then what can enemy do?\n\n  Enemy is at (6,9).\n  - Can they come after us? Not yet.\n  - Are there nearby threats? Not in immediate area around us.\n\nGoing DOWN toward (2,7) gets us a quick point, and we start gaining length.\n\n- **UP to (2,9)**: This goes towards the top edge. Might be okay, but does it open up future paths or corner us?\n  - From (2,9) next available moves would be LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN (not UP anymore).\n  - That\u2019s safe still.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,8)**: Moves left, gets further away from apples nearby.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,8)**: Moves laterally. Middle of board, keeping options open, but not eating.\n\nDOWN clearly gives us a useful apple, so let\u2019s do that.\n\nDo we risk enemy coming at us?\n\nEnemy is at (6,9). Their options:\n- DOWN: (6,8)\n- LEFT: (5,9)\n- RIGHT: (7,9)\n- UP: (6,10) \u2192 Invalid, off board\n\nThey might go DOWN to (6,8) or LEFT to (5,9). Neither immediately threatens us, we're at (2,8)/(2,7). We could grow there safely.\n\nLet\u2019s take the apple.\n\n#### Short plan:\nStart by taking the first apple below me to grow length and gain points. Watch Snake #1 next turn before deciding long-term path.\n\nDOWN",

I'll choose DOWN because:\n- It positions me closer to the majority of apples\n- It maintains flexibility for future moves\n- It avoids moving directly toward the enemy snake at (2, 8)\n\nI'll plan to continue moving toward the nearest apple while maintaining safe distance from the enemy snake and keeping my options open for future turns.\n\nDOWN",

It's currently closer to apples at (5, 2) than I am. However, moving UP gives me the most flexibility while keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\nMoving UP also positions me to potentially go for the apple at (2, 5) in the coming turns while maintaining flexibility. RIGHT would also be good, but UP gives me better positioning relative to the board center and multiple apple locations.\n\n**Short-term Strategy:**\nMove away from my body while maintaining distance from the enemy snake.

          "rationale": "Looking at the current board state, I need to plan my next move from position (5, 7). Let me analyze the possible moves:\n\n1. UP: Moving to (5, 8) - This is safe and gets me closer to the apple at (9, 7)\n2. DOWN: Moving to (5, 6) - This is safe and gets me closer to the apple at (5, 2)\n3. LEFT: Moving to (4, 7) - This is safe and gets me closer to apples at (5, 2) and (2, 5)\n4. RIGHT: Moving to (6, 7) - This is safe and gets me closer to apples at (9, 5) and (9, 7)\n\nAll four directions are currently safe since I have no body yet and none of these cells are occupied by the enemy snake's body (which is at (2, 8)).\n\nConsidering the enemy snake's position at (2, 9) with body at (2, 8), the enemy can only move LEFT to (1, 9) or RIGHT to (3, 9) this turn, as moving UP would go off board and moving DOWN would hit its own body. None of these moves would directly threaten my current position.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n- (5, 2) is relatively close to my current position\n- (2, 5) is somewhat close\n- (9, 5) and (9, 7) are farther away\n- (1, 1) is the farthest\n\nI think moving LEFT to (4, 7) is a good choice because:\n- It positions me closer to the apple at (5, 2)\n- It also gets me closer to the apple at (2, 5)\n- It maintains flexibility for future moves\n- It keeps me away from the enemy snake's current position\n\nI'll choose LEFT as it provides good positioning toward multiple apples while maintaining safety and flexibility.\n\nLEFT",
