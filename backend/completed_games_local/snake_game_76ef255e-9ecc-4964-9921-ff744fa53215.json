This keeps you on the top row where you can plan a controlled approach to other apples while watching enemy #0.\n- Moving LEFT now would delay growing and may allow you to slip toward (4,8), but risks little since you\u2019re behind the enemy and the top-right apple is a clear short-term gain.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Eat the apple by moving UP to (9,9) this turn.\n- On the next turn, move LEFT to (8,9) to keep your path open and avoid self-collision.\n- Subsequently consider dropping toward (8,8) to target (4,8) while monitoring enemy #0\u2019s movements to avoid head-on or entrapment.\n\nFinal move decision:\nUP",
