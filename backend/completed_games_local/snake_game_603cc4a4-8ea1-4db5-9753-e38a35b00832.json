Unsafe.\n- DOWN to (3, 3): within bounds, no collision with my body [(3,5)] or enemy body [(7,8),(6,8)]. Safe.\n- LEFT to (2, 4): within bounds, no collision. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (4, 4): within bounds, contains apple at (4, 4). Safe (eating apple is allowed, no body collision there currently).\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nHead-on collision risk:  \nEnemy possible moves from (7, 7): UP (7,8) collides with its own body, DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7), RIGHT (8,7).  \nMy possible safe destinations: (3,3), (2,4), (4,4). None overlap with enemy possible head positions this turn \u2192 no head-on risk.\n\nApple proximity:  \nClosest apple is (4, 4) at distance 1.  \n- RIGHT moves onto it directly \u2192 eat apple and grow.  \n- LEFT moves away (distance 3).  \n- DOWN moves away (distance 2).  \nEating an apple now gives me 2 apples total, still behind enemy (2 vs 2 apples tied? Wait: enemy has 2 apples, I have 1 currently. Eating (4,4) makes me 2 apples, tying enemy.)\n\nFuture mobility after each move (assuming growth if apple eaten):\n- RIGHT to (4, 4) and eat apple \u2192 new length 3, body becomes [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5)]. Next turn head at (4,4), possible moves: UP (4,5), DOWN (4,3), LEFT (3,4) (occupied by my body after move? Wait: after moving, my body will be [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5)], so (3,4) is my neck, so moving LEFT to (3,4) collides with own body \u2014 unsafe. So only UP and DOWN safe initially. That\u2019s only 2 safe moves, somewhat limiting.\n- DOWN to (3, 3): no apple eaten, length stays 2, body becomes [(3,3), (3,4)]. Next turn from (3,3) safe moves likely DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).\n- LEFT to (2, 4): no apple eaten, length 2, body [(2,4), (3,4)]. Next turn from (2,4) safe moves likely UP, DOWN, LEFT (RIGHT blocked by body at (3,4)).\n\nEnemy consideration: Enemy at (7,7) is distant. If I eat apple at (4,4), I\u2019ll be near center with length 3, giving more survivability but also more body to avoid. Enemy might go for (6,5) or (8,2) apples.\n\nLong-term: Eating apples early helps catch up in score, but must avoid trapping myself. Eating (4,4) now gives immediate growth and ties score with enemy. However, being at (4,4) next turn with only UP/DOWN safe is risky if enemy approaches. But enemy is far.\n\nBetter to eat apple now while it\u2019s safe and plan escape route: after eating, next turn I can go UP to (4,5) toward apple (6,5) or DOWN to (4,3) toward bottom apples later. That\u2019s acceptable.\n\nLEFT and DOWN don\u2019t get apple, keep me at length 2, which is less threatening but also less progress.\n\nDecision: RIGHT to (4,4) to eat apple.  \n\nPlan for next turn:  \nAfter moving RIGHT and eating apple, body: [(4,4), (3,4), (3,5)], length 3.  \nFrom (4,4), safe moves: UP (4,5), DOWN (4,3). LEFT (3,4) collides with body, RIGHT (5,4) is free but check board: (5,4) empty? Board shows nothing at (5,4). Actually RIGHT (5,4) is safe too \u2014 I mistakenly thought (3,4) was only occupied neck, but after move, body segments: head at (4,4), neck at (3,4), tail at (3,5). So (5,4) is empty. So all three except LEFT are safe? Let\u2019s check:  \nUP (4,5): empty.  \nDOWN (4,3): empty.  \nRIGHT (5,4): empty.  \nLEFT (3,4): occupied by my neck \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 3 safe moves actually. Good.\n\nSo RIGHT is safe now, gets apple, and keeps good mobility next turn.\n\n**RIGHT**",

Moving towards (6, 5) keeps multiple future moves open, including the possibility of moving towards (9, 9) or (8, 2) in subsequent turns.\n\n**Enemy Snake Position:**\n- Snake #0 is at (4, 4) with a body at (3, 4). It is not an immediate threat but should be kept in mind for future moves.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Move towards the apple at (6, 5) and then reassess the board.\n- Keep an eye on the enemy snake to ensure it doesn't blockade potential paths to other apples.\n- Prioritize collecting apples without getting into a corner or a dead-end.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the best move is to go for the apple at (6, 5).\n\nUP",

Safe.\n- DOWN to (4,3): within bounds, no collision. Safe.\n- LEFT to (3,4): collides with my own body. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (5,4): within bounds, no collision. Safe.\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nHead-on collision risk:  \nEnemy possible moves from (7,6): DOWN to (7,5), LEFT to (6,6), RIGHT to (8,6).  \nMy possible destinations: (4,5), (4,3), (5,4). No overlap \u2192 no head-on risk this turn.\n\nApple proximity and strategy:  \nClosest apples: (6,5) distance 3, (3,7) distance 4.  \n- UP to (4,5): reduces distance to (6,5) to 2 and to (3,7) to 3.  \n- RIGHT to (5,4): reduces distance to (6,5) to 2 but increases distance to (3,7) to 5.  \n- DOWN to (4,3): increases distances to both apples.  \nUP improves access to both nearest apples, while RIGHT focuses only on (6,5).  \nEnemy is close to (6,5) (distance 2) and likely to compete for it, risking future head-on collision. Apple at (3,7) is safer, as enemy is farther (distance 5). UP positions us better to pursue (3,7) while keeping options open.\n\nFuture mobility:  \nAfter moving UP to (4,5), body becomes [(4,5), (4,4), (3,4)]. Next turn from (4,5), safe moves: UP (4,6), LEFT (3,5), RIGHT (5,5) \u2192 3 options, good flexibility.  \nRIGHT to (5,4) also gives 3 safe moves next turn, but moves us closer to enemy and away from safer apple (3,7).  \nDOWN to (4,3) gives 3 safe moves but delays apple collection.\n\nPlan for next turns:  \nAfter UP, move LEFT to (3,5) if safe, then proceed toward apple at (3,7) via (3,6). Monitor enemy movement toward (6,5) and avoid head-on collisions. If enemy commits to (6,5), consider alternative apples like (8,2) or (9,2) later.\n\nConclusion: UP is the best move to safely approach an apple (preferring (3,7)) while maintaining mobility and avoiding competition with enemy.\n\nUP",
