Safe? That cell currently has nothing but an apple; Snake #1 is far away. Could another snake move there this turn? Snake #1 is at `(7,0)`, so moving UP would put it at `(7,1)`, no conflict.  \n- **RIGHT:** Goes to `(8,6)` \u2014 there's an apple. Safe? No snake or body there currently.  \n- **DOWN:** Goes to `(7,5)` \u2014 empty. Safe move.  \n- **LEFT:** Goes to `(6,6)` \u2014 empty. Safe move.  \n\nSo all four moves are safe immediately \u2014 no walls (board edges) or bodies in adjacent cells.  \n\n**Strategic thinking:**  \nWe want to eat apples but avoid dying next turn due to collision or getting trapped later.  \nUP gives an immediate apple (`(7,7)`), but after eating it, my body will be at `(7,6)` and I'll be at `(7,7)`. Next turn from `(7,7)` I can move DOWN (into my new body at `(7,6)`) \u2014 so that would be death. That means after eating the apple at `(7,7)`, I must avoid moving back into `(7,6)` next turn.  \n\nEating the apple at `(7,7)` means I need to avoid being stuck with only one safe move next turn. Let's check moves from `(7,7)` after eating: Possible moves: DOWN (blocked \u2014 my new body at `(7,6)`), LEFT (`(6,7)` \u2014 empty now), RIGHT (`(8,7)` \u2014 empty now), UP (`(7,8)` \u2014 empty). So from `(7,7)` after eating, I'd have 3 safe moves (excluding DOWN). That's fine.  \n\nEven better: eating an apple early boosts score; `(7,7)` is very close.  \n\nNow check RIGHT to `(8,6)` \u2014 also an apple. From `(8,6)` after eating, body at `(7,6)`, moves: LEFT (into body \u2014 blocked), UP (`(8,7)` empty), DOWN (`(8,5)` empty), RIGHT (`(9,6)` empty). So also 3 moves safe next turn.  \n\nBoth UP and RIGHT give apples this turn. Which is better?  \nSnake #1 is far away, so no imminent collision risk on either. `(7,7)` is closer to the center than `(8,6)`. `(8,6)` is closer to the east edge \u2014 less future flexibility maybe? But both are equal in safety this turn.  \n\nI'll pick `(7,7)` because it keeps me more central.  \n\n**Final decision:** UP.  \n\n**Plan for future turns after eating:** Avoid reversing into the new body segment next turn. Keep collecting apples while checking Snake #1's possible movements.  \nSince Snake #1 is at `(7,0)`, it might move up toward center soon \u2014 watch for it.  \n\nUP",

Eliminate.\n\nSo DOWN is not safe.\n\n---\n\n**Potential head-on collision with Snake #1:**\nSnake #1 at (7,1) can move in 4 directions: UP (7,2), DOWN (7,0), LEFT (6,1), RIGHT (8,1). None of these conflict with my possible head positions (7,8), (8,7), (6,7). So no head-on collision possible this turn.\n\nThus all three moves (UP, RIGHT, LEFT) are safe from collisions.\n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**\n- Closest apple is at (8,6) \u2014 down-right from head.\n- LEFT leads toward (0,7) apple but far.\n- UP leads toward center, maybe future flexibility.\n- RIGHT gets closer to apple at (8,6) but not directly there (would need DOWN next).\n\nFrom (7,7) to (8,6): needs RIGHT then DOWN next turn, but might be taken by then.\n\n---\n\n**Future moves after each option:**\n\n- **UP to (7,8)** \u2014 next turn could go LEFT (6,8), RIGHT (8,8), UP (7,9), DOWN (7,7) but (7,7) will stay empty (no body grows until after eating apple).\n- **RIGHT to (8,7)** \u2014 next turn adjacent to apple (8,6): could go DOWN to eat it next turn (unless Snake #1 gets closer). Flexibility: also UP (8,8), LEFT (7,7) safe, RIGHT (9,7).\n- **LEFT to (6,7)** \u2014 farthest from Snake #1, but apples far away.\n\nNo immediate apple this turn regardless.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**\nGoing RIGHT to (8,7) sets up eating (8,6) apple next turn if safe \u2014 increases score and keeps flexibility. It also avoids central area where Snake #1 may approach later.\n\nPlan: Next turn, consider DOWN to (8,6) for apple if available and safe, else explore other open areas away from Snake #1's likely path upward.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, rule: eating apple = grow by 1 segment at next turn's start; tail stays where it was. So this turn:  \n\n- If I don't eat apple \u2192 tail moves forward from (7,7) to where head was (8,7) simultaneously with my head moving to new position. So at end of turn, body will be [(new head), (8,7)]. The old tail cell (7,7) becomes empty. So my LEFT from (8,7) to (7,7) is safe because (7,7) is empty after tail moves? Correction: tail movement happens after head movement (simultaneous resolve). When resolving movement:  \n  1. All heads move to new positions.  \n  2. If head occupied apple, that snake grows (tail stays).  \n  3. If no apple eaten, all snakes move tail forward (so tail follows path).  \n\nThus if I go LEFT to (7,7), that's where my tail currently is, but that cell will be vacated by tail only after I've already moved my head into it \u2014 but no, that doesn't make sense: they are simultaneous. Actually, standard Snake rules:  \nCollision check is done **after** all heads move but **before** tails move. So at collision check: if I go to (7,7), is my body segment there? Yes, currently body is at (7,7) (tail). But at collision step, body segments are still all present (including tail). So (7,7) is part of my body \u2192 death! So LEFT is unsafe.\n\nRIGHT: (9,7) \u2014 empty. \u2713  \nDOWN: (8,6) \u2014 apple, no snake body. \u2713  \n\nSo unsafe: LEFT.  \nSafe: UP, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Head-on collisions with Snake #1:**\nSnake #1 at (7,2) can move UP (7,3), DOWN (7,1), LEFT (6,2), RIGHT (8,2).  \nMy possible moves:  \n- UP (8,8): no conflict.  \n- RIGHT (9,7): no conflict.  \n- DOWN (8,6): no conflict.\n\nSo no possible head-on collision this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Apple strategy & future safety:**\nApple at (8,6) is closest, so DOWN eats it immediately (score=2), Snake #1 score=0. That\u2019s good.\n\nAfter eating: my body becomes [(8,6), (8,7), (7,7)] next turn (tail stays at (7,7) until next move). Wait \u2014 no:  \nIf I eat apple at (8,6), I grow by 1 segment added at the tail after movement. So new body: head at (8,6), then old head (8,7), then old body (7,7), plus new segment (same as tail) added at end \u2014 but since we only had 2 segments before eating, after eating we will have 3: segments: (8,6) head, (8,7) segment 2, (7,7) segment 3/tail. So tail is still at (7,7) next turn.\n\nNext turn after eating apple at (8,6): from (8,6), possible moves: UP (8,7) is my own body \u2192 no; LEFT (7,6) empty; RIGHT (9,6) empty; DOWN (8,5) empty. So 3 safe moves.\n\nIs it too early to take apple? Not really \u2014 safest to collect apple when available, because it increases lead.\n\nUP or RIGHT don\u2019t get apple now but might set up future, but apple could be taken by Snake #1 later.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating apple (8,6), Snake #1 might head toward other apples. I\u2019ll have more body to block. Need to avoid trapping myself. Possibly go leftward toward (0,7) apple afterwards, keeping distance from Snake #1.\n\nGiven the above, eating apple now seems optimal.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",

But might waste a turn.\n\nGoing DOWN to (9,5) sets up eating apple (9,4) next turn unless Snake 1 interferes \u2014 but Snake 1 has no body length so it must avoid me too.\n\n---\n\n**4. Next turn safety preview**:  \nFrom (9,5): safe moves next turn?  \nCheck neighbors:  \n- DOWN to (9,4): apple there, Snake 1 could also move there if it goes RIGHT (8,4) then DOWN (8,4)? Wait: Snake 1 at (7,4), next turn can go RIGHT (8,4), then the turn after could go DOWN (8,4) to (8,4)? I mean: Snake 1 at (7,4) cannot reach (9,4) in 1 turn; in 2 turns, yes, but I\u2019d eat apple (9,4) before Snake 1 arrives, so no issue.\n\nActually:  \nTurn 5: me\u2192(9,5), Snake1\u2192(?,?) possible moves unknown but at (7,4) could go RIGHT to (8,4).  \nTurn 6: me\u2192(9,4) eat apple, Snake1 at (?,?) possibly (8,4) then could go RIGHT (9,4) \u2014 but that\u2019s exactly head-on collision! So risky next-next turn.  \n\nTo avoid, maybe after eating (9,4) I should not stay there; I can go LEFT immediately to (8,4) if Snake1 is not there yet, but if Snake1 goes (7,4)\u2192(8,4) turn 5, then at turn 6 Snake1 is at (9,4) if it goes RIGHT from (8,4)? Wait, coordinates:  \nTurn5: Me(9,5), Snake1(8,4)  \nTurn6: Me(9,4) & Snake1(9,4) simultaneously = head-on collision, both die.  \n\nSo that\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nBetter: This turn, go UP (9,7) to avoid racing for (9,4) immediately.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note**:  \nAvoid (9,4) next turn; Snake1 likely to move toward it. Instead, consider heading to other apples like (0,7) or (1,6) after positioning safely away from Snake1. Keep length lead; let Snake1 take (9,4) if it wants, then maybe trap it later.\n\n---\n\nUP",

Snake #0 can descend toward (9,4) over the next two turns; if we both commit we risk a head-on collision at (9,4) and mutual death. Because Snake #0 already has 2 apples, it may also decide to contest aggressively.\n\nRisk elimination:\n- No move immediately kills us (we have length 1 so no self-collision/backwards issue).\n- The primary strategic risk is moving RIGHT and inviting a direct contest for (9,4).\n\nChoice and short plan:\nI prefer to keep space and flexibility rather than immediately contest the right-side apple.

Apple targeting and next-turn positioning\n**Apple at (9,4)** is two moves away.  \nFrom (9,7):  \n- UP: moves away from that apple but maybe safer from Snake 1.  \n- LEFT: (8,7) is closer to center, more options next turn.  \n\nSnake 1 is at (7,5); it could go to (7,4) \u2192 (7,4) is closer to apple (9,4) in two moves if it goes RIGHT after. But apple (9,4) isn\u2019t contested urgently because I\u2019m long enough (3 vs Snake 1 length 1) \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t rush into a possible collision.  \n\nIf I go UP (9,8), next turn I can go LEFT or DOWN (but DOWN to (9,7) but will that be body? Next turn body will be: head to (9,8), tail moves \u2014 so (9,6),(8,6) becomes (9,7),(9,6) \u2014 next turn at (9,8) safe moves? Test:  \nNext turn from (9,8): UP \u2192 (9,9) safe; DOWN \u2192 (9,7) will be empty then (since body moved). So actually DOWN will be safe next turn after UP this turn.  \n\nIf I go LEFT (8,7) now, next turn body: head (8,7), body: (9,7), (9,6). From (8,7): UP (8,8) safe, DOWN (8,6) \u2014 body (9,6)? Wait, (8,6) is body segment now: but next turn body segments: from (9,7)\u2192(8,7), (9,6) remains but the second segment becomes (9,7) actually: Body next: [(9,7),(9,6)]. Check: Current: head (9,7), body (9,6),(8,6). New head to (8,7). Body updates: first segment = old head (9,7), second segment = old first body segment (9,6), tail segment (8,6) is gone? No: when moving without eating, all segments shift: so new body: (9,7), (9,6), and then the last segment (8,6) disappears since no growth. Wait but length is 3: after move without apple, length stays 3: so body: [old head, old body\u2026 but since length fixed: segments: (9,7) and (9,6) only? Actually: current length=3: head, body 2 segments. After move without apple: new head (8,7), body becomes [old head (9,7), old first body segment (9,6)], tail (8,6) is gone. Yes. So next turn from (8,7): UP: (8,8) safe; DOWN: (8,6) \u2014 is that in new body? New body cells: (9,7), (9,6). (8,6) not in body \u2192 safe. So actually both moves safe for next step too.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Avoiding Snake 1 movement predictions  \nSnake 1 length 1, so it must avoid me. But it can move freely. If I go LEFT (8,7),  Snake 1 could go to (8,5) or (7,6) etc., so not immediately threatening.  \n\nI see apple (1,6) is far; long-term I should go toward some apples but not (9,4) since Snake 1 may go there. Let Snake 1 have (9,4) and maybe trap itself.  \n\nUP gives more space along top edge.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (9,8), consider moving left across top to get to (0,7) apple eventually, avoid bottom where Snake 1 might be after getting (9,4).

Approaching it now is reasonable since the enemy can't go straight down to contest.\n- Moving RIGHT (to 8,5) moves me toward (9,4) while keeping multiple follow-up options open.

Wait, Snake 1 at (1,4) now; DOWN \u2192 (1,3), so no. Actually Snake 1\u2019s DOWN is (1,3), so (1,4) is its body next turn if it moves away. So (1,4) would be unsafe for me next turn if Snake 1 goes DOWN or RIGHT? Let\u2019s check: Snake 1 body will be [(1,4), (2,4), (3,4)] if it moves, so (1,4) is its body segment next turn \u2014 so DOWN to (1,4) next turn would be deadly.

Decision**  \nGoing DOWN risks head-on collision if Snake 1 chooses UP. That\u2019s too risky since it ends the game with me possibly losing (Snake 1 has 2 apples, I have 4 after eating \u2192 I win if both die, but why risk it?).  \n\nLEFT and RIGHT are safe this turn but reduce future mobility.  \nRIGHT seems better than LEFT because it keeps me more central and away from edge traps.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose **RIGHT** to (2, 6) to avoid collision risk and maintain options.  \n\n---\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN**  \nFrom (2,6), look to approach apples at (2,8) via UP or (1,5) via LEFT/DOWN later.

I prefer RIGHT because it keeps me toward more open board space (avoiding the tight cluster of my own body on the left) and maintains better access to apples on the right/top while avoiding stepping into an occupied/blocked corridor.\n\nShort plan:\n- Move toward open space and contest apples if they become reachable (particularly 2,8 if it becomes free). Avoid chasing into tight areas near my own body; reassess after enemy moves and choose a path that preserves multiple escape options.\n\nRIGHT",

That\u2019s fine: eat apple, grow to length 6, body expands next turn \u2014 but where is tail? In 2 turns, tail moves from (3,6) to (3,7) maybe, but growth means tail doesn\u2019t move that turn, so (3,8) and (3,7) still occupied? Check path after eating (4,9) from (3,9): after eating, new segment at old tail (3,6) then (3,7) and (3,8) still block? Actually: on turn of eating, body: head (4,9), then old head (3,9), then (2,9)?? Wait, my current body: (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6). If I go RIGHT (3,9) now, then body: (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (3,7), tail (3,6). Then next turn RIGHT to (4,9) apple: head (4,9), add segment at tail, so tail stays at (3,6), body: (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6). Then available moves from (4,9): UP off, DOWN (4,8) empty \u2705, LEFT (3,9) body \u274c, RIGHT off \u2014 so only DOWN is safe. That is a dead end if Snake 1 comes near, risky.  \n\nBetter to keep more options: LEFT (1,9) leaves two safe moves, can then go down toward apple (0,7) or maneuver.  \n\nLong-term: With both snakes at 4 apples, prefer safety over greedy immediate apple if it traps me.\n\n---\n\n**5.

Wait \u2014 check board: Apple at (5,8) is not listed initially \u2014 no, apples were at (3,1), (6,0), (4,9), (3,6), (4,2). No apple at (5,8). So maybe Snake1 didn't move to (5,8) last turn? Or did it? Let's see:  \nTurn 27: Snake 1 head (5,7) could go UP to (5,8) empty \u2014 but no apple at (5,8) on board given for Turn 28. That's consistent: apple not there, so Snake1 maybe didn't go there or ate it and apple gone? But apples listed for turn 28 same as turn 27 except (0,7) gone (I ate it) \u2014 oh! I see: I ate (0,7), so apples now are the original minus that one. So Snake 1 still at (5,7) on previous turn might have moved to (4,7) or (6,7) or (5,6) (deadly) or (5,8). The new Snake 1 head is (5,8) in current turn's data. That means Snake 1 moved UP last turn to (5,8). That cell didn't have an apple (since apples at turn 27: (0,7),(3,1),(6,0),(4,9),(3,6),(4,2) \u2014 6 apples? Wait, only 5 were listed in text under \"Apples at:\" in Turn 27? Hmm mismatch \u2014 but anyway, (5,8) no apple initially, so Snake 1 just moved there without eating. So apples unchanged except (0,7) eaten by me.\n\nActually count listed apples at turn 28: 5 \u2014 I ate one so 6 existed before? Wait my apples collected: 5 at turn 27, now 6? No, still 5 in Turn 28 header \u2014 so perhaps I hadn't eaten yet before last move \u2014 so Turn 28 is after my move: i.e., Board shown at Turn 28 post-move \u2014 so I just ate (0,7) so my apples now 6 \u2014 but scores just say \"Scores so far: Your snake apples: 5, Snake #1 apples: 5\" \u2014 that might be pre-move score, but my snake info says Apples collected: 5 \u2014 so maybe the board is pre-move and \"Your snake\" info is pre-move and I'm choosing Turn 28 move now. Yes, because Turn 27 was just played, and scores are after Turn 27. So current head is (0,7) because I moved LEFT from (1,7) to (0,7) eating the apple, so now my length is 6. Apples listed are also updated (since (0,7) not in apple list).\n\nAlright, so current reality: My head (0,7), body includes old head (1,7) and the rest. New length 6.\n\n---\n\n**1. Immediate Safety Check from (0,7)**\n\n- UP \u2192 (0,8): Empty \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,6): Empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,7): My body \u274c deadly  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u274c deadly  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN  \n\n---\n\n**2. Snake 1 Threat**  \nSnake 1 head at (5,8). Distance: Manhattan= |0-5|+|7-8| = 5+1=6. No collision possible this turn.\n\nSnake 1 possible moves from (5,8):\n- UP (5,9): empty \u2705\n- DOWN (5,7): body \u274c\n- LEFT (4,8): empty \u2705\n- RIGHT (6,8): empty \u2705\nSnake 1 can go for apple at (4,9) via UP then LEFT next or LEFT then UP. But far from me.\n\n---\n\n**3. Apple Targeting**  \n\nApples: (3,1), (6,0), (4,9), (3,6), (4,2)\n\nClosest apple to (0,7): \n- (3,6) distance 3+1=4\n- (4,9) 4+2=6\n- (4,2) 4+5=9\n- (3,1) 3+6=9\n- (6,0) 6+7=13\n\nBest target: (3,6) \u2014 need path: from (0,7) go RIGHT to (1,7)? deadly. So must go UP/DOWN first.  \n\nUP (0,8) \u2192 then can go RIGHT to (1,8) \u2014 but (1,8) is my body! Wait check body: [(1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7)] \u2014 indeed (1,8) is occupied by me.  \n\nSo from (0,8): possible moves:  \nUP: (0,9) empty \u2705  \nRIGHT: (1,8) my body \u274c  \nLEFT: off board \u274c  \nDOWN: (0,7) my neck body \u274c (the segment behind head after move? Actually at that time head at (0,8), body: (0,7) is the neck \u2014 yes deadly to reverse into neck)  \n\nSo from (0,8) only UP is safe! That's bad \u2014 dead end route.\n\nFrom (0,6):  \nUP: (0,7) neck \u274c  \nDOWN: (0,5) empty \u2705  \nRIGHT: (1,6) empty \u2705  \nLEFT: off board \u274c  \nSo from (0,6): safe moves DOWN and RIGHT. Much better.\n\n---\n\n**4. Decision**\n\nGoing UP from (0,7) leads to (0,8) where only UP is safe next turn \u2014 trap.\n\nGoing DOWN from (0,7) leads to (0,6) with DOWN and RIGHT safe. From there can go to (1,6), then to (2,6), etc., toward apples (3,6) or (4,2). More flexibility.\n\nGiven the corner risk of UP, DOWN is clearly better.\n\n---\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN**\n\nFrom (0,6), go RIGHT to (1,6) to open space. Avoid going further into left column. Target apple (3,6) via path (2,6)->(3,6) if safe. Watch Snake 1 movement near (4,9). Keep middle options open.\n\nDOWN",

That puts me one step away from the apple at (4,9) so I can take it next turn.

Distance = |0-4| + |6-8| = 4+2 = 6 squares away, so no collision possible this turn.\n\n**Apple targeting:**\nMy closest apple is (3, 6), distance 3 + 0 = 3.  \nFrom (0, 6) to (3, 6):  \n- Shortest path: RIGHT x3 \u2192 (3, 6). But need to check intermediate squares (1, 6), (2, 6) are empty. They are.\n\nBut Snake 1 is closer to (3, 6) at distance |4-3| + |8-6| = 1+2=3, so Snake 1 can reach it in fewer turns (maybe 2 turns). So going for (3, 6) risks head-on collision. Snake 1\u2019s moves from (4, 8) to (3, 6): possible path LEFT to (3, 8) then DOWN to (3, 7) then DOWN to (3, 6)? That\u2019s 3 moves. Wait: shorter: (4,8) -> (3,8) -> (3,7) -> (3,6) = 3 moves; or (4,8) -> (4,7) -> (3,7) -> (3,6) = 3 moves. So Snake 1 needs 3 moves actually. From (0,6) -> (1,6) -> (2,6) -> (3,6) is also 3 moves, so tie.

This gives more future flexibility.\n\nThus RIGHT is better to keep options open.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Next turn plan:** From (1, 6), likely go DOWN or RIGHT to avoid pushing toward Snake 1 if they aim for (3,6).

But they move simultaneously.\n\nOn next turn, could Snake 1 reach a cell I move into? Snake 1 can move up to 1 square closer.  \nFrom (4, 9) possible moves:  \n- UP off board \u274c\n- DOWN to (4, 8) \u2014 body, deadly \u274c\n- LEFT to (3, 9) safe for Snake 1? Board shows empty. Yes.\n- RIGHT to (5, 9) safe for Snake 1? Board shows empty. Yes.\n\nThey have two safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nGiven distance 6, no chance of head-on collision this turn. Future turns if we converge toward same apple, maybe conflict later.\n\n**Apple targeting:**\n\nApples: (3, 1), (6, 0), (3, 6), (4, 2), (2, 5).\n\nFrom my head (1, 6):  \n- Closest is (2, 5) distance |1-2| + |6-5| = 1+1 = 2!  \n- Next: (3, 6) distance 2+0 = 2, but Snake 1 also closer to it. Conflict risk.  \n- (4, 2) distance 3+4=7.  \n- (2, 5) is very close; I can eat it in 2 moves.\n\n**Path to (2, 5) via DOWN then LEFT from (1, 6)?** Wait: actually from (1,6) \u2192 (1,5) DOWN \u2192 (2,5) is RIGHT and DOWN. Better: (1,6) \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 (2,5)? That\u2019s RIGHT, then DOWN.  \nBut DOWN from (1,6) \u2192 (1,5) then I can eat apple (2,5) by going RIGHT, but check my body in the way? From (1,5) possible moves: UP (neck) \u274c, DOWN \u2705, LEFT (0,5) body? No, (0,6) is body but (0,5) empty, \u2705. RIGHT \u2705. So that's fine.\n\nSnake 1's distance to (2, 5): |4-2| + |9-5| = 2+4 = 6, so no competition.\n\n**Future space after move:**\n\n- DOWN to (1, 5): Next turn safe moves: DOWN (1,4), LEFT (0,5), RIGHT (2,5). Avoid UP (neck).\n- RIGHT to (2, 6): Next turn safe moves: UP? (2,7) empty? yes. DOWN (2,5) empty. LEFT neck \u274c. RIGHT (3,6) empty? Actually (3,6) has apple A, so no body, safe. Wait, Snake 1's body has (4,6) but (3,6) is fine. So UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n\nRIGHT gives more options (future flexibility).\n\n**Risk:** If I go RIGHT toward (2,6), Snake 1 might try for (3,6) apple, possibly risking head-on collision next turn?  \nFrom (2,6), Snake 1 at (4,9) might move to (3,9) or (5,9), then next turn possibly to (3,8) then (3,7), etc. Unlikely immediate risk.  \n\nBetter to take RIGHT to stay flexible and approach both (3,6) and (2,5) options next turn.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (2,6), assess whether to go DOWN to (2,5) for apple or RIGHT to (3,6) if Snake 1 not threatening. Likely DOWN to (2,5) is safer and gives growth without conflict.\n\nRIGHT",

If I go RIGHT to (3, 6), Snake 1 could move toward it but can\u2019t reach it this turn. Next turn, if Snake 1 moves toward (3, 6), possible head-on collision if we both go for it? Let\u2019s check:  \n\nFrom (3, 6) next turn, Snake 1 could be at (3, 8) if it goes DOWN twice? Wait, from (3, 9) possible moves: LEFT (3, 9) already head? Actually Snake 1 head is at (3, 9) now. Their safe moves: LEFT (2, 9)? Off board? No, x=2, y=9 is valid. Wait, coordinates: (3, 9) LEFT \u2192 (2, 9) is valid. DOWN \u2192 (3, 8) valid. RIGHT \u2192 (4, 9) body \u274c. So they have LEFT and DOWN safe.  \n\nIf Snake 1 goes DOWN to (3, 8), then next turn they could go DOWN to (3, 7), then DOWN to (3, 6) \u2014 that\u2019s 3 moves total. I would eat apple this turn if I go RIGHT, so next turn my head is at (3, 6), body longer. Then Snake 1 would be at (3, 8) next turn, then (3, 7) the turn after, then (3, 6) the turn after that \u2014 but by then I\u2019ve already eaten it and moved away. So no head-on collision risk if I eat (3, 6) this turn.  \n\n**Future flexibility after each move:**\n\n- RIGHT to (3, 6): Eat apple, grow. Next turn from (3, 6): check neighbors: UP (3, 7) empty, DOWN (3, 5) empty, LEFT (2, 6) my body \u274c, RIGHT (4, 6) Snake 1 body \u274c. So safe moves: UP, DOWN. That\u2019s only 2 options, slightly constrained.  \n- DOWN to (2, 5): Eat apple, grow. Next turn from (2, 5): UP neck \u274c, DOWN (2, 4) empty, LEFT (1, 5) empty, RIGHT (3, 5) empty. So safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2192 3 options, more flexible.  \n- UP to (2, 7): No apple. Next turn from (2, 7): UP (2, 8) empty, DOWN neck \u274c, LEFT (1, 7) my body \u274c, RIGHT (3, 7) empty. Safe: UP, RIGHT \u2192 2 options. Less flexible.  \n\n**Risk assessment:**\n\nGoing RIGHT to eat (3, 6) puts me next to Snake 1\u2019s body at (4, 6), reducing future moves slightly but I get growth.  \nGoing DOWN to eat (2, 5) also gives growth and more future flexibility.  \nSnake 1 is far from (2, 5), so safer.  \n\nGiven I want to maximize growth while avoiding future traps, DOWN seems better \u2014 more options next turn.  \n\n**Decision:** DOWN to (2, 5).  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating (2, 5), assess whether to move toward (4, 2) or (3, 1) for next apple, keeping distance from Snake 1.  \n\nDOWN",

No, (1, 8) is empty now since my tail was there before but moved? Wait \u2014 My body from last turn at turn 32: (1, 8) was my tail? At turn 33 now, my body doesn\u2019t include (1, 8) anymore because I moved from (2, 5) to (2, 4). Yes, my body segments shifted: in old state turn 32, my body was [(2,6), (1,6), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (1,8)], then head moved to (2,4), so body is now [(2,5), (2,6), (1,6), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7)]. So (1, 8) is indeed free.** Actually check if Snake 1\u2019s LEFT (1,8) is safe for them: my body not there, so yes, possible.  \n\nSo Snake 1\u2019s safe moves from (2, 8): UP \u2192 (2,9) safe, DOWN \u2192 (2,7) safe, LEFT \u2192 (1,8) safe, RIGHT \u2192 (3,8) body \u274c. So snake 1 can\u2019t go right into its own neck. They might go to (2,7) likely.  \n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple: (3, 6): distance 2 (RIGHT then UP).  \nSnake 1 distance to (3, 6): (2,8) \u2192 2 moves (LEFT then DOWN? No, that\u2019s (1,8) -> (1,7) not helpful. Actually: fastest: DOWN (2,7) then LEFT (1,7)?? Not toward (3,6). They need to go DOWN then RIGHT? Actually wait, shortest path for them: from (2,8) to (3,6): need to go RIGHT first \u2014 but they can\u2019t: (3,8) is their own body. So they must go around: DOWN (2,7), RIGHT (3,7), DOWN (3,6) = 3 moves. Or DOWN (2,7), DOWN (2,6), RIGHT (3,6) = 3 moves. So I have advantage: I can get there in 2 moves.  \n\nBut head-on risk if Snake 1 goes to (3,6) same time as me next turn: they cannot in 2 moves as seen. Actually path: They start turn 33 at (2,8). If they go RIGHT not possible (neck). So after their turn 33 move, they\u2019re at (1,8) or (2,7) or (2,9). Then turn 34 they move toward (3,6): earliest arrival turn 35 for them. Me: from (2,4), RIGHT (3,4) turn 33, UP (3,5) turn 34, UP (3,6) turn 35 \u2014 same time. Potentially both arrive turn 35: collision possible if they target same spot. They could also go (2,7) turn 33, (3,7) turn 34, (3,6) turn 35, yes. So possible collision.  \n\nBetter to avoid contest and go for less risky apple: (4,2) distance 4 moves or (3,1) distance 5 moves\u2014Snake 1 far from those.  \n\n**Future flexibility after current move:**  \nFrom (2, 4):  \n- If LEFT (1,4): next turn safe directions? UP (1,5) body \u274c (body has (2,5)), LEFT (0,4) safe, DOWN (1,3) safe, RIGHT neck \u274c. So 2 options.  \n- If RIGHT (3,4): next turn safe: UP (3,5) safe, DOWN (3,3) safe, LEFT neck \u274c, RIGHT (4,4) safe. So 3 options.  \n- If DOWN (2,3): next turn safe: UP neck \u274c, LEFT (1,3) safe, DOWN (2,2) safe, RIGHT (3,3) safe. So 3 options.  \n\nSo LEFT gives fewer options \u2014 avoid.  \n\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT:  \nRIGHT moves toward (3,6) \u2014 potential future contest with Snake 1 \u2014 better not risk head-on if both target.  \nDOWN moves toward empty area bottom, eventual path to (3,1) apple without Snake 1 interference.  \n\n**Conclusion:** DOWN is safe, maximizes options, avoids conflict.  \n\n**Plan:** After DOWN to (2,3), consider heading left/down toward (3,1) or eventually (6,0), keeping space from Snake 1.  \n\nDOWN",

From Snake 1 at (1, 8) to (3, 6): they'd take 3 moves too (e.g., (1,8) \u2192 (1,7) \u2192 (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (3,6) \u2014 wait, that\u2019s 4. Let\u2019s check shortest: (1,8) \u2192 (1,7) \u2192 (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (3,6) = 4 moves; maybe (1,8) \u2192 (1,7) \u2192 (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) or (1,8) \u2192 (0,8) \u2192 (0,7) but that's my body there (0,7) blocked for them. So they can't go to (0,7). So they'd need to go (1,8) \u2192 (1,7) \u2192 (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (3,6): 4 moves. Actually maybe fastest: (1,8) \u2192 (1,7) \u2192 (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (3,6): 4 moves.  \n\nYes, I can reach (3,6) in 3 moves: (2,3) \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 (3,4) \u2192 (3,5) \u2192 (3,6) \u2014 No \u2014 wait, that\u2019s 4 moves. Let's check:  \n\nStart (2,3)  \nTurn 34: RIGHT (3,3)  \nTurn 35: UP (3,4)  \nTurn 36: UP (3,5)  \nTurn 37: UP (3,6) \u2014 oops, that\u2019s 4 moves indeed. So earlier I miscalculated.  \n\nSo Snake 1 would take 4 moves also. But there's intermediate collision possibilities with Snake 1 moving toward that apple. Might be dangerous \u2014 head-on possible at intersection points.  \n\nApple (4,2) \u2014 closer to my current location by Manhattan: from (2,3) to (4,2): x diff 2, y diff 1 \u2192 3 moves total. Path: Two RIGHTs and one DOWN in some order. This apple is far from Snake 1 (distance 6 moves for them), so safer.\n\nApple (3,1): My distance 3 moves (RIGHT+DOWNS). Snake 1 distance large. Safer.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2014 Snake 1 movement predictions:**\n\nFrom Snake 1 head (1,8): Possible moves: UP (1,9) safe, DOWN (1,7) safe, LEFT (0,8) safe, RIGHT \u274c (2,8) own body.  \n\nThey will likely go toward (3,6), so DOWN (1,7) gets closest. That move does not intersect my immediate path if I go RIGHT or DOWN now.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2014 Conflict avoidance:**\n\nRIGHT (3,3) puts me in line for apples (4,2) or (3,6) but also closer to Snake 1\u2019s possible path.  \nDOWN (2,2) keeps me low, heading for (3,1) or (4,2) from below, away from Snake 1 entirely \u2014 safest strategically.  \nLEFT (1,3) eventually toward bottom-left but maybe limits apple access short-term \u2014 but still okay.\n\nGiven equal mobility, better to steer clear of Snake 1\u2019s region (upper board).\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDown seems safest, maximizing distance from Snake 1 while keeping apples (3,1) and (4,2) reachable.\n\nDOWN",

Body length increased by 1, so new body includes old (3,2) and everything else shifted:  \nHead (4,2), then (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (1,6).  \nApples left: (3,1), (6,0), (3,6), (5,4), (5,0) \u2014 wait, need to check: apple at (4,2) is gone; (3,1) still there, (5,4) still there.\n\n**Enemy snake #1:**  \nHead at (3,7) last turn; they could only move RIGHT (to (4,7)) according to last analysis, but actually they had moves possibly UP (3,8) (their body) \u274c, DOWN (3,6) \u274c (my body? No, (3,6) has an apple \u2014 so it's open actually \u2014 wait let's check).  \n\nActually let\u2019s check:  \nLast turn snake#1 head (3,7) from: body [(2,7), (1,7), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9)]? Board at turn 37 shows: Snake #1 - Head: (3,7), Body: [(2,7), (1,7), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9)]  \nMoves from (3,7):  \nUP (3,8) = body \u274c  \nDOWN (3,6) = empty (apple) \u2705  \nLEFT (2,7) = body \u274c  \nRIGHT (4,7) = empty \u2705  \n\nSo my last rationale was wrong: they had 2 moves possible: DOWN (3,6) or RIGHT (4,7).  \n\nThis turn (turn 37 now), we see their head is (3,7) but apple (3,6) is still there \u2014 so they didn\u2019t go DOWN, which means they went RIGHT to (4,7)? Wait no: if they took apple (3,6), it\u2019d be gone. Apple still there means they moved RIGHT to (4,7) only.  \n\nChecking: yes, apple (3,6) is still in the list, so they went to (4,7) to avoid collision with my body at (3,6)? No.. (3,6) was empty with apple, not my body\u2026 hmm. Actually (3,6) is apple; my body ends at (1,6). So they could\u2019ve gone down to eat it but didn\u2019t. Possibly because they saw risk? Maybe they chose RIGHT for some reason.\n\nBut in current state: enemy head is at (3,7) still? No \u2014 re-reading: the given state says head (3,7) and body includes (2,7)... Wait careful: current enemy head at turn 37: Snake #1 - Head: (3,7). That means they did not move at all from last turn? That\u2019s impossible \u2014 oh, I see: the state for this turn (37) is the *initial state* before we choose move? Actually it says \"Turn: 37 / 150\" so this is start of turn 37, and the \"last move info\" was for turn 36.  \n\nSo right, enemy head was (2,7) last turn, now is (3,7) means they moved RIGHT from (2,7) to (3,7)? That contradicts last turn\u2019s given state\u2026 Wait, check: Last turn\u2019s info said: snake#1 head (2,7)\u2026 hmm but maybe I misread then. I\u2019ll stick to current data:  \n\nNow: snake#1 head (3,7), body [(2,7), (1,7), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9)]  \n\nSo they moved from (2,7) to (3,7) meaning last turn they moved RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**My current possible moves from (4,2):**  \n\nUP (4,3): empty \u2705  \nDOWN (4,1): empty \u2705  \nLEFT (3,2): my body \u274c (neck)  \nRIGHT (5,2): empty \u2705  \n\nSafe: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Next turn safety for each:**  \n\nUP (4,3):  \nFrom there: UP (4,4) empty, DOWN neck \u274c, LEFT (3,3) empty, RIGHT (5,3) empty \u2014 3 safe moves.\n\nDOWN (4,1):  \nUP neck \u274c, DOWN (4,0) empty, LEFT (3,1) apple (and possibly risk from snake1?), RIGHT (5,1) empty \u2014 3 safe moves.\n\nRIGHT (5,2):  \nUP (5,3) empty, DOWN (5,1) empty, LEFT neck \u274c, RIGHT (6,2) empty \u2014 3 safe moves.\n\nAll are equally safe in flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**Apple access:**  \nApple (5,4) is 2 moves away if I go UP\u2192RIGHT or RIGHT\u2192UP.  \nApple (3,1) is close if I go DOWN, but that\u2019s near corner.  \n\nSnake #1 at (3,7) \u2014 they can go UP (3,8) body \u274c, LEFT (2,7) body \u274c, so only DOWN (3,6) apple, RIGHT (4,7) empty. They\u2019ll likely go DOWN to (3,6) for the apple.  \n\nIf they do, they\u2019ll be at (3,6) next turn, blocking my path upward through x=3,y>5.  \n\nBetter to go RIGHT (5,2) or UP (4,3) toward (5,4). RIGHT feels safer because enemy is far away, and it gives access to apples (5,4) and (6,0) later.  \n\nGoing DOWN (4,1) leads to apple (3,1) but dead-end area.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns after this:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (5,2), move UP to (5,3), then maybe (5,4) for apple, avoiding possible enemy path.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\nThey might go for apple (8,5) or (5,4) but if they go toward (5,4) they need several turns. We can beat them to it by going UP now.\n\n---\n\n**5. Long-term:**  \nEating an apple at (5,4) also opens path toward center/upper-right apples afterward without trapping myself, since my snake's tail is at (2,5). Once I eat apple, new tail will be same place but head will be free to move right toward (8,5).\n\nLEFT or RIGHT without eating apple delays growth and lets enemy catch up in score (both at 7 apples currently).\n\n---\n\n**6.

Apples and strategy**:  \nThe eaten apple was at (5,4) \u2014 gone now. Remaining apples:  \nClosest are (6,0), (3,1), (5,0) near bottom, (8,5) top-right, (1,3).\n\nRight now my body blocks bottom-left side: body segments occupy many lower rows near left edge. Moving LEFT (4,4) towards apple (3,1) requires going down into a narrow corridor between my own body and wall \u2014 risky later.  \n\nMoving RIGHT (6,4) leads toward the apple at (8,5) via going right & up, possibly also toward (6,0) by going down later \u2014 more open space.\n\nMoving UP (5,5) is safe but maybe delays apple gathering \u2014 though it keeps central position.\n\n---\n\n**4. Enemy**: Snake #1 at (4,7). Possible moves:  \nUP (4,8) empty, DOWN (4,6) body \u274c, LEFT (3,7) body \u274c, RIGHT (5,7) empty.  \nSo they can go UP or RIGHT. If they go RIGHT to (5,7), they are close to none of my immediate targets except maybe (8,5) later. Minimal interaction risk this turn regardless.\n\n---\n\n**5. Decision**:  \nGiven my body layout, safest foraging path is toward right side board where apples exist and less self-trapping risk.  \nRIGHT moves me toward (8,5) and (6,0) eventually, with space to maneuver.  \nLEFT leads toward cramped area with my own long body.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns**: After RIGHT to (6,4), likely go UP to (6,5) then RIGHT toward (8,5) apple, or DOWN later for (6,0). Avoid trapping near left wall.\n\nRIGHT",

That\u2019s risky.\n\n2. **UP (8,7)**  \n   From (8,7): UP (8,8) empty, DOWN neck \u274c, LEFT (7,7) enemy head currently there \u2014 but enemy will move this turn. If enemy moves away, (7,7) could be safe next turn. But if enemy stays or goes there, danger. Actually, enemy at (7,7) now, so (7,7) is empty after this turn if enemy leaves. But (7,7) still risks enemy moving back into it next turn, but that\u2019s head-on collision. Calculate: after I move to (8,7), enemy\u2019s possible moves: from (7,7) enemy can go DOWN (7,6) \u2014 which is where my LEFT would go this turn? Wait, no \u2014 I\u2019m evaluating (8,7) this turn. Next turn, enemy can indeed be at (7,6) if they go down, but if I go UP to (8,7) now, next turn I can\u2019t go down (neck), so possible moves next turn from (8,7) are UP (8,8), LEFT (7,7), RIGHT (9,7). But (7,7) would be empty after enemy leaves this turn unless enemy goes to (7,7) again which can\u2019t happen because they\u2019re already there. So (7,7) is safe next turn unless enemy returns there \u2014 but can enemy return in one move? No, they\u2019re at (7,7) now, so not possible. So (7,7) safe next turn. Actually no: after this turn, enemy will be elsewhere. So next turn from (8,7): 3 moves possible: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Safe.\n\n3. **LEFT (7,6)**  \n   From (7,6) next turn: UP (7,7) possibly enemy\u2019s new position? No, enemy currently (7,7), if enemy goes DOWN to (7,6) this turn\u2014oh, collision! But if I go LEFT to (7,6) and enemy goes DOWN to (7,6), we both die (head-on). So LEFT is risky because enemy can choose DOWN. Enemy\u2019s safe moves from (7,7): UP (7,8) empty, DOWN (7,6) empty, RIGHT (8,7) empty. LEFT (6,7) body \u274c. So enemy can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n   If enemy goes DOWN to (7,6) and I go LEFT to (7,6), collision. So LEFT has a head-on collision risk this turn. So that\u2019s unsafe. So remove LEFT.\n\nSo actually safe without possible head-on collision: UP and RIGHT only if no enemy can enter my destination cell simultaneously. But enemy can\u2019t enter (9,6) in one move from (7,7): distance = 2. So RIGHT is safe. Enemy can\u2019t enter (8,7) in one move from (7,7) except RIGHT to (8,7) \u2014 yes! If enemy goes RIGHT to (8,7) and I go UP to (8,7), head-on collision. So UP is also risky.  \n\nLet\u2019s list head-on risk:\n\n- UP (8,7): enemy possible moves include RIGHT (8,7) \u2192 collision if both choose. So possible but not certain.  \n- RIGHT (9,6): enemy can\u2019t reach (9,6) in 1 move. Safe from head-on.  \n- LEFT (7,6): enemy possible moves include DOWN (7,6) \u2192 collision.  \n\nSo among safe moves:  \n- UP: possible head-on if enemy moves RIGHT (8,7).  \n- LEFT: possible head-on if enemy moves DOWN (7,6).  \n- RIGHT: no head-on possible.\n\nSo RIGHT is only 100% safe from head-on.\n\n---\n\n**Strategic preference:**  \nRIGHT eats apple (9,6) but next turn only UP is safe. That\u2019s a trap. Could be okay short-term but limits future.  \nHowever, if I take RIGHT, I extend lead to 10 vs 7 apples. And I can assess next turn if enemy is far.\n\nEnemy might go for apples (6,0),(5,0) \u2014 far from me.  \n\nI\u2019d choose RIGHT now to secure apple, then next turn go UP (9,7) and plan from there.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn**: After eating (9,6), go UP to (9,7) \u2014 that\u2019s only safe move. Then we\u2019ll have more room.\n\nRIGHT",

Is (9,5) empty? Let's see the board: Row 5 col 9\u2014no snake data shown. Actually, enemy snake is far. Apple possible? No. So (9,5) is safe? Let\u2019s confirm: Enemy body: ends at (4,6), so not near. Yes, empty. So DOWN safe.  \n- **LEFT** to (8, 6): my body segment (first body part after head) \u2014 \u274c unsafe.  \n- **RIGHT**: off board \u2014 \u274c unsafe (x=10 doesn't exist).  \n\nSo safe: UP, DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Next-turn safety**\n\n**UP (9,7)**:  \nPossible moves from (9,7) next turn: UP(9,8) empty, DOWN neck(9,6) empty but maybe occupied after enemy moves? Let\u2019s check enemy\u2019s current possible moves: enemy at (7,8): UP (7,9) empty, DOWN (7,7) its own body? Wait, enemy body segments: head (7,8), body: [(7,7), ...] \u2192 so DOWN (7,7) is body \u274c for enemy. LEFT (6,8) body? body has (6,8) yes \u274c. RIGHT (8,8) empty. So enemy only safe move: UP (7,9) and RIGHT (8,8). So enemy cannot reach (9,7) or (9,6) in one move, so DOWN next turn from (9,7) is safe. Also LEFT next turn (8,7) empty. So from (9,7) next turn, safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT \u2014 3 options. Good.\n\n**DOWN (9,5)**:  \nFrom (9,5) next turn: possible moves: UP neck \u274c, DOWN (9,4) empty, LEFT (8,5) \u2014 is (8,5) in my body? Yes, (8,5) is in my current body (second segment). \u274c. RIGHT off board \u274c. So only 1 safe move next turn: DOWN to (9,4).

Correction: Current enemy head is (8,8)?? Wait, Snake #1 head at (8,8) now?? Let's check board state:  \n\nYes, Snake #1 head: (8,8). That means (8,8) is enemy head, not empty \u2014 so LEFT from (9,7) now would collide with enemy head?? Actually yes, LEFT to (8,7) \u2014 wait no, (8,7) is next to enemy head (8,8). But do I die immediately moving to (8,7)? Only if (8,7) has snake body. Check Snake #1 body: [(7,8), (7,7), ...] \u2014 (8,7) not in its body. So (8,7) is empty. But **next turn** from (9,8) if Snake #1 stays or moves to threaten? Alternatively, starting from current turn: choosing LEFT now:  \n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (8,7):  \nFrom (8,7), next-turn moves: UP (8,8) \u2014 but Snake #1 head is there now. If Snake #1 moves away from (8,8), maybe okay, but risky because Snake #1 might move to (8,7) next turn? Or head-on collision considered only if we swap places exactly? Wait, rules: head-on collision if both move into same cell. This turn: Snake #1 at (8,8). Possible moves for Snake #1: UP (8,9) empty, DOWN (8,7) empty, LEFT (7,8) its body \u274c, RIGHT (9,8) empty. So Snake #1 can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,7) *now* and Snake #1 goes DOWN to (8,7), we both die (head-on collision). That\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nSimilarly, Snake #1 going RIGHT to (9,8) is safe for it, no collision with me since I\u2019d be at (8,7). Snake #1 going UP to (8,9) safe for it. So only danger is if Snake #1 chooses DOWN to (8,7). Is that likely? From its view, DOWN goes into empty currently (value: unknown if safe next turn for it). Since I would be at (8,7) this turn, from enemy view moving DOWN lands on my head? Wait no \u2014 if Snake #1 moves DOWN to (8,7) after I moved there, it would collide with my head and both die. So it may avoid that if it sees the risk. But we can\u2019t assume it avoids \u2014 it might not predict. Thus LEFT is risky: possibility of head-on collision with Snake #1.\n\n**UP** \u2192 (9,8):  \nFrom (9,8) next turn: Snake #1 possible moves: If Snake #1 stays at (8,8) or moves UP to (8,9), safe for me. If Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (9,8), then head-on collision next turn only if I stay at (9,8) next turn (which I wouldn\u2019t necessarily). Immediate danger: Choosing UP: possible head-on collision this turn? Snake #1 moving RIGHT to (9,8) while I move UP to (9,8) this turn? Yes \u2014 simultaneous move \u2192 both die. So UP is also dangerous due to possible Snake #1 move to (9,8).\n\nThus both UP and LEFT risk head-on collision if Snake #1 chooses certain moves:\n- UP danger: Snake #1 goes RIGHT to (9,8).\n- LEFT danger: Snake #1 goes DOWN to (8,7).\n\nWe don\u2019t know Snake #1\u2019s move, so must guess likelihood.\n\n**Step 3: Minimizing risk**  \n\nSnake #1 at (8,8):\nSafe moves for it: UP (8,9), DOWN (8,7), RIGHT (9,8).\nAll three possible. Which is safest for it? Its body: [(7,8), (7,7), ...]  \n- UP (8,9): empty, safe next moves? Possibly.  \n- DOWN (8,7): empty, safe next moves? Possibly.  \n- RIGHT (9,8): empty, safe next moves? Possibly.  \n\nNo obvious apple very close except maybe (6,0) far away. But Snake #1 might avoid immediate suicide:  \n- It dies if it collides with me head-on. So from Snake #1\u2019s reasoning: If it goes RIGHT to (9,8), it risks me going UP to (9,8) \u2014 possible but maybe not certain \u2014 but possible. Snake #1 doesn\u2019t know my move, might avoid? Unpredictable.\n\nBetter to choose my move to avoid possibility entirely:  \n\nActually, only if both moves lead to same cell do we collide. So I should pick a move to a cell Snake #1 is unlikely to target.\n\nSnake #1 body blocks LEFT (7,8), so it won\u2019t go left.  \nFrom Snake #1\u2019s perspective, possible moves:  \nIf it thinks I might go UP (since I\u2019m near top edge, maybe), then Snake #1 avoids RIGHT? Not necessarily.\n\nBut Snake #1 going DOWN to (8,7) gets it closer to center and apples.\n\nSafer for me: UP to (9,8) \u2014 if Snake #1 chooses RIGHT, we collide.  \nLEFT to (8,7) \u2014 if Snake #1 chooses DOWN, we collide.\n\nNo way to avoid risk entirely except if Snake #1 chooses UP (8,9), which avoids collision for both my UP and LEFT.  \n\nLikelihood: Snake #1 might go UP (8,9) for apple (1,6) path? Or go DOWN toward apples (6,0), (5,0)?  \nFrom (8,8), DOWN seems path toward more apples (via left/down). So maybe Snake #1 goes DOWN. That means my LEFT is dangerous.\n\nThus UP is safer guess.\n\n**Step 4: Apples/mobility**  \n\nUP (9,8): top row, can go LEFT toward apple (1,6).  \nLEFT (8,7): more central, but risky.\n\nGiven scores: I\u2019m leading (10 vs 7 apples), so avoid unnecessary risk. But must pick a move.\n\n**Final choice:** UP slightly safer given enemy incentivized to go DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (9,8), next turn likely LEFT along top row to approach apple (1,6), but watch for Snake #1 movement.\n\nUP",

But Snake #1\u2019s body: has head (7,9), body: (8,9), (8,8), (7,8), \u2026  \n\nYes! (8,9) is Snake #1\u2019s body segment (2nd segment after head). So moving LEFT to (8,9) would hit enemy body \u2192 \u274c unsafe.  \n\n- RIGHT: off board (x=10) \u2192 \u274c unsafe.  \n\nAll four moves are immediately deadly?? That can\u2019t be correct unless I\u2019m totally trapped. Let me double-check:  \n\nBoard row 9 from left to right:  \nRow 9: . . . . . . . 1 T 0  -> columns 7: Snake#1 head (7,9), col 8: \"T\" (Snake#1 body, the segment (8,9)), col 9: \"0\" (my head).  \n\nSo indeed:  \nLEFT -> (8,9) \u2192 occupied by Snake #1 body.  \nUP -> off board.  \nDOWN -> my body (9,8).  \nRIGHT -> off board.\n\nI have no safe moves if this is turn start \u2014 but wait, is (7,9) an enemy head AND (8,9) its body? Could snake #1 move away from (7,9) before I check moves? No \u2014 moves happen simultaneously; I must assume current board state is before movement, so any cell with snake body now is fatal for me to enter, including enemy body (rule: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die\").\n\nConclusion: All my moves are fatal.\n\nBut if that\u2019s truly the case, I\u2019m dead no matter what, so the only outcome is to choose one and lose.\n\nBut maybe the board notation: \"T\" means tail of Snake #0? Let\u2019s check: Snake #0\u2019s tail is at (5,3) \u2014 far away.  \nSnake #1\u2019s tail is at (5,8) \u2014 so \"T\" at (8,9) is not its tail, it\u2019s just body. The legend: \"0\" = your head, \"1\" = enemy head, \"T\" = tail of either snake? But could be body segment? Wait, given the labeling, \"T\" probably means \"tail of any snake\", else body is \".\"? Actually looking at row8:  \nRow 8: . . . . . T T T T T  \nHere T at (8,6) is my body \u2014 not my tail \u2014 so maybe \"T\" = body (non-head) segment of any snake? Then \".\" = empty.  \n\nYes, consistent:  \nMy body: (9,8)=T, (9,7)=T, (9,6)=T, (8,6)=T, etc. Enemy body: (8,9)=T, (8,8)=T, (7,8)=T, etc.\n\nSo (8,9) = T \u2192 Snake #1 body = fatal.\n\nI have no safe move. Game over. Pick randomly.\n\nGiven that, the rules say if all moves kill me, pick one anyway. Might as well go DOWN into myself.\n\nDOWN",
