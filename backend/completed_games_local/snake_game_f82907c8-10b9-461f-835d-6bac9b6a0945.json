Eating it will grow me to length 2 (head at (2, 2), tail at (1, 2)).  \n\n**Future safety after eating apple:**  \nIf I eat apple at (2, 2), next turn my body will be [(2, 2), (1, 2)].  \nFrom (2, 2), possible moves: UP (2, 3), DOWN (2, 1), LEFT (1, 2) \u2013 but (1, 2) will be my tail next turn, so moving LEFT into my own tail is safe? Wait \u2014 rules say: \u201cMoving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\u201d But (1, 2) is directly behind my head only if I move from (2, 2) to (1, 2) and my tail is at (1, 2) \u2014 that\u2019s exactly moving backwards into the cell that will become my new tail after growth. Let\u2019s check:  \nAfter eating apple at (2, 2), my body will be [(2, 2), (1, 2)] in that order. Next turn if I move LEFT to (1, 2), that\u2019s the current tail cell, but after growth the tail stays in place until I move without eating an apple. Actually, in Snake mechanics, when you eat an apple, you grow at the next move: so after moving to (2, 2) and eating, my length becomes 2, tail stays at (1, 2). Next turn, if I move LEFT to (1, 2), my head goes into the tail cell \u2014 but since the tail will move forward after my move (because I didn\u2019t eat an apple that turn), that cell will be empty by the time my head arrives? Wait, simultaneous movement: tail moves after head moves? In standard Snake game logic: each turn, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves into the previous segment\u2019s position, so the tail vacates its old cell before head occupies it unless head moves into it immediately. But if head moves into the cell the tail just left, it\u2019s fine. However, if head moves into the cell where tail currently is and tail hasn\u2019t left yet, that\u2019s a collision.  \n\nLet\u2019s clarify with rules: \u201cIf your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\u201d So if (1, 2) is still part of my body when I move into it, I die. When does tail move? In simultaneous movement, all snakes move at once: so my head moves from (2, 2) to (1, 2), my tail moves from (1, 2) to ??? Actually, with length 2, body is [(2, 2), (1, 2)]. After moving head to (1, 2), body becomes [(1, 2), (2, 2)]? Wait, that\u2019s wrong \u2014 the second segment goes to where head was. So new body: head at (1, 2), second segment at (2, 2). So tail is at (2, 2). So (1, 2) is no longer part of my body after the move. So moving LEFT from (2, 2) to (1, 2) is safe because tail leaves (1, 2) at same time head enters it.  \n\nSo eating apple now is safe for next turn options.  \n\n**Other moves:**  \nUP, DOWN, LEFT don\u2019t get apple but are safe. But getting apple early helps score and growth for future space control.  \n\n**Enemy\u2019s possible moves:**  \nEnemy head at (5, 5), body at (6, 5).  \nPossible moves: UP (5, 6), DOWN (5, 4), LEFT (4, 5), RIGHT (6, 5) \u2014 but (6, 5) is its own body, so RIGHT is invalid. So enemy likely goes UP, DOWN, or LEFT. None threaten me immediately.  \n\n**Best move:**  \nRIGHT to (2, 2) to eat apple, grow, and stay safe.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 2) with body at (1, 2), consider moving toward another apple \u2014 maybe (3, 4) via UP and RIGHT, or (1, 4) via LEFT and UP, but need to check enemy movement. Keep central options open.  \n\nRIGHT",

Need to collect apples faster.  \n\nFrom (2, 2), closest apples:  \n- (3, 4) is 2 steps: could go UP to (2, 3) then RIGHT to (3, 3) then UP to (3, 4) next turn, but that\u2019s 2 turns.  \n- (1, 4) is 2 steps: UP to (2, 3) then LEFT to (1, 3) then UP to (1, 4).  \n\nBut maybe better to move toward center to keep options open.  \n\n**Check future safety after each move:**  \n- UP to (2, 3): then next turn moves: UP (2, 4), DOWN (2, 2) \u2013 my old tail vacated, safe, LEFT (1, 3), RIGHT (3, 3). All likely safe unless enemy moves into them.  \n- DOWN to (2, 1): then next turn moves: UP (2, 2), DOWN (2, 0), LEFT (1, 1), RIGHT (3, 1).  \n- LEFT to (1, 2): then next turn moves: UP (1, 3), DOWN (1, 1), LEFT (0, 2), RIGHT (2, 2) \u2013 but (2, 2) will be my body segment (old head) after this turn, so moving RIGHT next turn would be into my own body (not safe). So LEFT now reduces next turn\u2019s options (RIGHT would be deadly).  \n- RIGHT to (3, 2): then next turn moves: UP (3, 3), DOWN (3, 1), LEFT (2, 2) \u2013 my old head position, which will be my body segment, so LEFT next turn is deadly, RIGHT (4, 2) safe.  \n\nSo both LEFT and RIGHT now make one direction deadly next turn (backwards into body). UP or DOWN keep all four directions open next turn.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nUP gets me closer to apples at (3, 4) and (1, 4).  \nDOWN gets me closer to apple at (4, 1) but farther from most apples.  \n\nGiven early game, staying central and keeping options open is wise. UP seems best: moves toward more apples, keeps all four moves next turn, safe now.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 3), assess enemy position, then decide to go toward (3, 4) or (1, 4) or other apples. Avoid boxing myself in.  \n\nUP",

Eating it would grow me to length 3.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 2) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 3) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 3) \u2013 currently my body segment (tail).  \n\n**Safety check:**  \n- UP: (1, 4) is an apple, not occupied by any snake body. Safe.  \n- DOWN: (1, 2) empty, safe.  \n- LEFT: (0, 3) empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT: (2, 3) is my body segment (tail). But simultaneous move: if I don't eat an apple, my tail moves from (2, 3) to ??? Wait, my body is only [(2, 3)], so after I move without eating, my tail becomes at (1, 3) (old head). So (2, 3) becomes empty. But the rule says: if you move into any snake's body (including your own) at the time of movement, you die. At the start of this turn, (2, 3) is my body segment, so moving RIGHT into it is deadly. So RIGHT is unsafe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Enemy possible moves from (5, 8):**  \nEnemy body at (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5). Moves:  \n- UP (5, 9) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN (5, 7) \u2013 its own body, invalid.  \n- LEFT (4, 8) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT (6, 8) \u2013 empty.  \n\nEnemy could go for apple at (6, 9) or (4, 9) etc. No immediate collision threat to me this turn.  \n\n**Growth vs safety:**  \nUP to (1, 4) eats apple, grows to length 3. That's good to catch up (enemy has 3 apples, I'd have 2).  \nBut after eating, my body becomes [(1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3)]? Wait, careful:  \nCurrent: head (1, 3), body [(2, 3)], length 2.  \nIf I eat apple at (1, 4): new head at (1, 4), old head (1, 3) becomes new body segment 1, old body (2, 3) becomes segment 2. So body: [(1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3)], length 3.  \n\nNext turn from (1, 4): possible moves: UP (1, 5) empty, DOWN (1, 3) my body (deadly), LEFT (0, 4) empty, RIGHT (2, 4) empty. So DOWN deadly, others safe. That's fine.  \n\nIf I go DOWN or LEFT now, I avoid apple but stay length 2, still safe. But enemy is longer, so I need to grow.  \n\n**Risk of going UP:**  \nCould enemy move to (1, 4) this turn? No, enemy at (5, 8), impossible in 1 move.  \nCould enemy move to (1, 5) or (0, 4) or (2, 4) to block me next turn? Unlikely, too far.  \n\nSo UP seems safe and beneficial.  \n\n**Future planning:**  \nAfter eating apple at (1, 4), I'll be at (1, 4) with body behind me. Next turn I can go UP to (1, 5) toward (1, 6) apple, or LEFT to (0, 4) to open space, or RIGHT to (2, 4) toward (3, 4) apple.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBest move is UP to eat apple and grow.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 4), avoid DOWN into own body. Prefer UP to (1, 5) to go toward (1, 6) apple, or RIGHT to (2, 4) to go toward (3, 4) apple, depending on enemy position. Keep away from enemy's likely path toward top apples.  \n\nUP",

Wait, after moving LEFT, my body shifts: head to (0, 4), body becomes [(1, 4), (1, 3)], tail at (2, 3) moves forward? Actually, no apple eaten, so tail moves from (2, 3) to (1, 3), so (1, 4) becomes body, (1, 3) becomes body, (2, 3) empty.

Going RIGHT now gets me closer to (3, 4) but slightly farther from (1, 6).  \n\n**Safety check for UP (1, 5):**  \nNo enemy can reach (1, 5) this turn.  \nNext turn from (1, 5), enemy could be at (4, 9) or (6, 9), still far.  \nFrom (1, 5), I\u2019ll have 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) unless my own body blocks one. Let\u2019s check:  \nIf I go UP now to (1, 5) without eating apple:  \nMy body next turn: head (1, 5), body segments: (1, 4), (1, 3). Tail (2, 3) disappears.  \nSo from (1, 5) next turn:  \n- UP (1, 6) apple (empty now).  \n- DOWN (1, 4) my body (deadly).  \n- LEFT (0, 5) empty.  \n- RIGHT (2, 5) empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves again. Good.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI need to grow to catch up (enemy has 3 apples, I have 2).  \nTarget (1, 6) apple next if I go UP now.  \nAvoid moving toward enemy until longer.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nUP is safe, keeps options open, progresses toward nearest apple (1, 6).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 5), go UP to (1, 6) to eat apple unless enemy threatens.  \n\nUP",

Wait, after eating apple, tail doesn't move, so new segment added at head's old position? Actually, growth: head moves to (1, 6), old head (1, 5) becomes new body segment, rest of body stays, tail stays at (1, 3). So body: [(1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3)].  \n- Next turn from (1, 6): moves: UP (1, 7) empty, DOWN (1, 5) my body (deadly), LEFT (0, 6) empty, RIGHT (2, 6) empty. So 3 safe moves.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 5):  \n- No apple eaten, body shifts: head (0, 5), body [(1, 5), (1, 4)], tail (1, 3) disappears.  \n- Next turn from (0, 5): UP (0, 6) empty, DOWN (0, 4) empty, RIGHT (1, 5) my body (deadly), LEFT off board.

So 3 safe moves.  \n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is (1, 6) directly above. Eating it now grows me to length 4, enemy length 5.  \nEnemy is far away, so safe to eat.  \n\n**Safety check for UP (1, 6):**  \nNo enemy can reach (1, 6) this turn.  \nAfter eating, my body blocks (1, 5) but I still have 3 exits from (1, 6) next turn.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEat (1, 6) now, then consider moving toward (3, 4) or (0, 7) depending on enemy position. Enemy is in top rows, so maybe go left/right after eating to avoid being trapped against top later.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gets apple safely, increases length, keeps options open.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 6), go UP to (1, 7) or LEFT/RIGHT to avoid staying in crowded column, but check enemy position then.  \n\nUP",

Enemy is at (2, 9) and could move toward (1, 9) or (2, 8), not immediately threatening but could cut off my escape later.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is longer (6 vs my 4). I need to grow but avoid being trapped.  \nUP or RIGHT keeps more options open.  \nRIGHT moves me toward center, which is generally safer.  \nUP moves me toward top row where enemy is, but enemy is at (2, 9) and might move away.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT gives more future flexibility and moves toward center, avoiding the left-edge trap.

Last turn I successfully moved DOWN and collected the apple at (0, 7). There's an apple at (0, 6) directly below me. The enemy snake is now at (3, 5) and appears to be moving around the middle of the board.\n\n**Analyzing all four directions from (0, 7):**\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (0, 8)\n   - This is where my body currently is (first body segment)\n   - Would move into my own body \u2717\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (0, 6)\n   - Safe: Within bounds, no body collision\n   - **APPLE at (0, 6)!** I'll collect it \u2713\n   - Continues my sweep down the left edge\n   - Enemy snake #1 is at (3, 5), far away\n   - Excellent move \u2713\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (-1, 7)\n   - **ILLEGAL**: Off the board (x ranges 0-9)\n   - Would kill me \u2717\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (1, 7)\n   - Safe: Within bounds, not my body\n   - No apple there\n   - Moves me away from the apple path on the left edge\n   - Less strategic than DOWN \u2717\n\n**Safe moves: DOWN only**\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nDOWN to (0, 6) collects another apple and continues my successful left-edge strategy. This:\n- Gets me the apple at (0, 6) immediately\n- Gives me 8 apples total, increasing my lead to 8-3\n- Positions me well for collecting more apples on the left and bottom edges\n- Keeps me safe and far from the enemy snake\n- After reaching (0, 6), I can plan to move right along the bottom rows collecting multiple apples\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 13: Move DOWN to (0, 5) or RIGHT if better positioned\n- Continue collecting apples from the cluster at the bottom (there are many apples at y=0,1,2,3)\n- The right side has many apples (9,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3) that I can work toward\n- Maintain safe distance from enemy snake\n\nDOWN",

Wait, initial length is 3 for all snakes, plus apples eaten. It has 7 apples \u2192 length 10? Let\u2019s check: body length = 7 segments listed after head? Actually head (0,7) + body 7 cells = total length 8. Yes, because initial length 3 + 7 apples = 10? That\u2019s wrong \u2014 initial length is 3, each apple adds 1 length, so length = 3 + apples eaten. It has 7 apples \u2192 length 10. But listed body length after head is 7 cells? That\u2019s inconsistent unless some apples were eaten but tail didn\u2019t grow yet? Actually growth happens after eating apple next turn. Let\u2019s trust given: body length from list is 7 cells after head, so total length = 8. Maybe it ate an apple last turn and will grow next turn. Anyway, it\u2019s longer than me.)  \n\n**Apples nearby from (3, 5):**  \n- (3, 4) \u2013 1 step DOWN (apple).  \n- (4, 3) \u2013 2 steps right-down.  \n- (5, 3) \u2013 farther.  \n- (6, 5) \u2013 3 steps right.  \n- (4, 1), (6, 1) \u2013 far.  \n- (0, 6) \u2013 far left.  \n\n**Possible moves from (3, 5):**  \n- UP \u2192 (3, 6) \u2013 my body (deadly).  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 4) \u2013 apple!  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 5) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 5) \u2013 empty.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Enemy possible moves from (0, 7):**  \nEnemy body: (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9).  \nMoves:  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 8) \u2013 its own body (deadly).  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 6) \u2013 empty (apple at (0, 6) actually).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (-1, 7) \u2013 off board (deadly).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 7) \u2013 empty.  \n\nSo enemy can go DOWN to (0, 6) or RIGHT to (1, 7).  \n\n**Risk of head-on collision:**  \nMy DOWN to (3, 4): enemy DOWN to (0, 6) or RIGHT to (1, 7) \u2192 no collision.  \nMy LEFT to (2, 5): enemy same \u2192 no collision.  \nMy RIGHT to (4, 5): enemy same \u2192 no collision.  \n\n**Future options after each move:**  \n\n1. **DOWN to (3, 4)** \u2013 eat apple, grow to length 5 next turn (tail stays, body becomes [(3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (2, 7)]).  \n   Next turn from (3, 4): UP (3, 5) \u2013 my body (deadly). DOWN (3, 3) \u2013 empty. LEFT (2, 4) \u2013 empty. RIGHT (4, 4) \u2013 empty.

DOWN (2, 4) \u2013 empty. LEFT (1, 5) \u2013 empty. RIGHT (3, 5) \u2013 my body (deadly).

Eating apple now is good for score, but enemy is far, so no immediate danger.  \n\n**Plan:**  \nTake apple now to catch up in score.

LEFT is deadly if enemy stays at (0, 4), but enemy will move simultaneously.  \n\n**Enemy possible moves from (0, 4):**  \nEnemy body: (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9).  \nMoves:  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 5) \u2013 its own body (deadly).  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 3) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (-1, 4) \u2013 off board (deadly).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 4) \u2013 my head currently there (but I will move).  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe moves: DOWN to (0, 3) or RIGHT to (1, 4).  \n\n**Simultaneous move risks:**  \nIf I go LEFT to (0, 4) and enemy goes RIGHT to (1, 4), we swap positions without collision (heads cross but not same cell). That\u2019s safe.  \nIf I go LEFT to (0, 4) and enemy goes DOWN to (0, 3), then I occupy (0, 4) and enemy occupies (0, 3) \u2014 no collision.  \nSo LEFT is safe this turn.  \n\nIf I go UP to (1, 5) and enemy goes RIGHT to (1, 4), no collision.  \nIf I go UP to (1, 5) and enemy goes DOWN to (0, 3), no collision.  \nUP safe.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (1, 3) and enemy goes RIGHT to (1, 4), no collision.  \nIf I go DOWN to (1, 3) and enemy goes DOWN to (0, 3), then both heads to (0, 3) and (1, 3) \u2014 no collision.  \nDOWN safe.  \n\nSo all three moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) are safe this turn.  \n\n**Future options after each move:**  \n\n1. **UP to (1, 5)** \u2013 no apple.

Body shifts: head (1, 3), body [(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7)], tail (2, 7) disappears.  \n   Next turn from (1, 3):  \n   UP (1, 4) \u2013 my body (deadly).  \n   DOWN (1, 2) \u2013 empty.  \n   LEFT (0, 3) \u2013 possible enemy there if enemy moved DOWN this turn.  \n   RIGHT (2, 3) \u2013 empty.  \n   So 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT) guaranteed, LEFT risky if enemy there.  \n\n3. **LEFT to (0, 4)** \u2013 no apple there now. Body shifts: head (0, 4), body [(1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7)], tail (2, 7) disappears.  \n   Next turn from (0, 4):  \n   UP (0, 5) \u2013 enemy body (deadly).  \n   DOWN (0, 3) \u2013 possibly enemy there if enemy moved DOWN this turn.  \n   LEFT (-1, 4) \u2013 off board (deadly).  \n   RIGHT (1, 4) \u2013 my body (deadly).  \n   So 0 or 1 safe move (only DOWN if enemy not there). That\u2019s very risky.  \n\nSo LEFT leads to a potential trap next turn.  \n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is (2, 5) from my current (1, 4): that\u2019s 1 up, 1 right.  \nFrom (1, 4), UP gets me closer (to (1, 5), then next turn maybe RIGHT to (2, 5) to eat it).  \nFrom (1, 4), DOWN moves away from it.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI need to catch up in apples (6 vs 8).  \nUP gives me future access to (2, 5) apple next turn, while keeping 2 safe moves now.  \nLEFT is too dangerous next turn.  \nDOWN moves away from most apples.  \n\nBest: UP now, then RIGHT next turn to eat (2, 5) apple if possible.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 5), go RIGHT to (2, 5) to eat apple, unless enemy blocks.  \n\nUP",

That\u2019s a trap. So DOWN is unsafe next turn if we eat apple here.  \n\n- **UP to (2, 7)**: No apple. Body shifts: head (2, 7), body [(2, 6), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)], tail (3, 5) disappears.  \n  Next turn from (2, 7):  \n  UP (2, 8) \u2014 empty.  \n  DOWN (2, 6) \u2014 my body (deadly).  \n  LEFT (1, 7) \u2014 empty.  \n  RIGHT (3, 7) \u2014 empty.  \n  So 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n- **RIGHT to (3, 6)**: No apple. Body shifts: head (3, 6), body [(2, 6), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 4)], tail (3, 5) disappears.  \n  Next turn from (3, 6):  \n  UP (3, 7) \u2014 empty.  \n  DOWN (3, 5) \u2014 my body (deadly).  \n  LEFT (2, 6) \u2014 my body (deadly).  \n  RIGHT (4, 6) \u2014 empty.  \n  So 2 safe moves (UP, RIGHT).  \n\n**Strategic choice:**  \nDOWN leads to immediate apple but traps me next turn \u2014 unacceptable.  \nUP gives 3 safe moves next turn and moves away from enemy.  \nRIGHT gives 2 safe moves next turn but moves toward more open space (right side has apples later).  \n\nEnemy is at (2, 3) and can move DOWN or RIGHT. If enemy moves RIGHT to (3, 3), that\u2019s closer to me if I go RIGHT to (3, 6) \u2014 not a direct threat now but could limit future moves.  \n\nUP seems safest for preserving options.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 7), consider moving toward apples on right side (6, 5) etc., but avoid boxing myself in. Keep distance from enemy\u2019s possible positions.  \n\nUP",

Collects an apple and moves toward the right-edge cluster\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT offer apple collection. RIGHT to (9, 2) is strategically superior because:\n- It collects an apple immediately\n- It positions me at the far right edge where I can harvest the entire right-side cluster: (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 3), (9, 0)\n- The enemy is at (6, 5), far from this area\n- This keeps me ahead and builds momentum\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. RIGHT to (9, 2) - collect apple (apples: 13)\n2. DOWN to (9, 1) - collect apple (apples: 14)\n3. DOWN to (9, 0) - collect apple (apples: 15)\n4. UP to (9, 1), then (9, 2), then (9, 3) - harvest remaining right edge apples\n5. Move left and down to collect (8, 1), (8, 4), and other accessible apples\n6.

I can see several apples nearby that I can collect.\n\n**Available apples near my head at (9, 2):**\n- (9, 1): 1 down\n- (9, 3): 1 up\n- (9, 0): 2 down\n- (8, 1): 1 left, 1 down\n- (8, 4): 1 left, 2 up\n\n**Evaluating all four safe moves:**\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (9, 3)\n   - Within bounds \u2713\n   - Not in my body \u2713\n   - Not in enemy body \u2713\n   - **Apple at (9, 3)!** \u2713\n   - Safe \u2713\n   - This collects an apple and continues moving up the right edge\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (9, 1)\n   - Within bounds \u2713\n   - Not in my body \u2713\n   - Not in enemy body \u2713\n   - **Apple at (9, 1)!** \u2713\n   - Safe \u2713\n   - This collects an apple and moves toward the lower right cluster\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (8, 2)\n   - This is my body's first segment\n   - Moving backwards into myself \u2717\n   - ELIMINATED\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (10, 2)\n   - This is outside the board (x > 9)\n   - ELIMINATED\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nBoth UP and DOWN are safe and collect apples. Let me consider the sequence:\n- DOWN first would let me collect (9, 1), then (9, 0), building down the right edge\n- UP first would let me collect (9, 3), then (6, 9) or other upper apples\n\nThe lower right cluster has concentrated apples: (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 1). Moving DOWN allows me to harvest these in sequence before the enemy can interfere. The enemy is at (5, 5), still relatively far away.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. DOWN to (9, 1) - collect apple (apples: 14)\n2. DOWN to (9, 0) - collect apple (apples: 15)\n3. LEFT to (8, 0), then UP to traverse the right edge efficiently\n4. Continue collecting the concentrated apple clusters while maintaining distance from the enemy\n5. Monitor enemy position and avoid head-on collisions\n\nDOWN",

Let me reconsider my body position.\n\nWait, let me recount my body carefully. My head is at (9, 0), and my body list is:\n[(8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)]\n\nSo:\n- Position 1: (8, 0) - directly adjacent to head\n- Position 2: (8, 1)\n- Position 3: (9, 1)\n\nFor UP from (9, 0) to (9, 1): This is position 3 in my body. Moving there would be death.\nFor LEFT from (9, 0) to (8, 0): This is position 1 in my body (directly behind). This is moving backwards into my own body - death.\nFor RIGHT from (9, 0) to (10, 0): Out of bounds - death.\nFor DOWN from (9, 0) to (9, -1): Out of bounds - death.\n\n**This is a critical situation - I appear to be in a dead-end position!** However, I must still choose. Let me pick the move that might work if there's any possibility or if my understanding is off.\n\nActually, wait. After eating an apple, the tail should move forward (the snake grows). Let me reconsider: when I moved RIGHT to (9, 0) on the last turn and ate the apple, my tail at (0, 5) should have stayed, making me longer. But logically I should have just moved and grown.\n\nGiven the constraints and that all moves appear lethal, I'll attempt UP as it's the only direction that doesn't immediately exit the board, hoping there's a game state interpretation issue.\n\n**Long-term strategy note:** I appear to be in a trapped position with limited escape routes. This suggests I need to be more careful about creating escape routes earlier in the game. For future turns, prioritize maintaining open paths and avoid boxing myself in against the board edges and my own body.\n\nUP",

That means enemy dies this turn unless I\u2019m missing something. Let\u2019s check:  \nEnemy body occupies (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (8,2), (7,2), etc.  \nFrom (9,0):  \nUP (9,1) = body  \nDOWN off board  \nLEFT (8,0) = body  \nRIGHT off board  \n\nYes \u2014 enemy has **no legal moves** and will die this turn.  \n\nThat means if I survive this turn, I win immediately (all opponents dead).  \n\n---\n\n**So my only goal: survive this turn.**  \n\nFrom my safe moves:  \n- LEFT (1,6) \u2192 onto apple, grow by 1, safe.  \n- UP (2,7) \u2192 safe, no apple.  \n- RIGHT (3,6) \u2192 safe, no apple.  \n\nAll three are safe from immediate death (no wall, no body).  \n\nBut wait \u2014 enemy head at (9,0) cannot move into me anyway. No head-on collision risk.  \n\nSo any of UP, LEFT, RIGHT is fine.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn (if somehow enemy survives due to rule misunderstanding):**  \nIf enemy is dead, game ends. If not, I should continue toward apples while avoiding dead ends.  \n\nLEFT gets apple now, but after eating, my body extends: new tail? Actually, eating apple means next turn my tail stays where it is (growth), so my body will be longer, but head at (1,6) next turn.  \n\nCheck mobility after LEFT:  \nFrom (1,6) after eating apple:  \nUP (1,7) \u2013 apple (safe)  \nDOWN (1,5) \u2013 empty  \nLEFT (0,6) \u2013 empty  \nRIGHT (2,6) \u2013 my body (deadly)  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nAfter UP (2,7):  \nUP (2,8) \u2013 empty  \nDOWN (2,6) \u2013 my body (deadly)  \nLEFT (1,7) \u2013 apple (safe)  \nRIGHT (3,7) \u2013 empty  \nAlso 3 safe moves.  \n\nAfter RIGHT (3,6):  \nUP (3,7) \u2013 empty  \nDOWN (3,5) \u2013 my body (deadly)  \nLEFT (2,6) \u2013 my body (deadly)  \nRIGHT (4,6) \u2013 empty  \nOnly 2 safe moves (UP, RIGHT).  \n\nSo UP and LEFT give better mobility next turn.  \n\n---\n\nGiven enemy is dead this turn, I can pick any safe move. But to be safe in case I misread rules, pick the one with best future mobility and possibly get apple: LEFT gets apple now and good mobility.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",
