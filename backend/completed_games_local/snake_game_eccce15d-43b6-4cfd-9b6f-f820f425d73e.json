Its possible moves:\n- NORTH: (5,9) - moving away from me\n- SOUTH: (5,7) - safe distance\n- WEST: (4,8) - could intersect if I go UP+RIGHT\n- EAST: (6,8) - moving away from me\n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk exists with my current position.\n\n**Apple Accessibility:**\nThe closest apples are:\n- (6,1) - 5 moves away (down-right area)\n- (7,8) - 4 moves away (upper-right, near Snake #0)\n- (8,9) - 5 moves away (far upper-right)\n- (3,0) - 5 moves away (bottom-left)\n- (4,1) - 4 moves away (bottom area)\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nRIGHT to (5,5) continues my movement toward the center and positions me well to access apples in multiple directions. UP to (4,6) moves me closer to the upper apple cluster but also closer to Snake #0. DOWN to (4,4) moves me toward the lower apples but away from the more valuable upper area where Snake #0 currently dominates.\n\nGiven that Snake #0 has 2 apples and is positioned near the upper-right cluster, I should avoid direct confrontation and focus on the lower apples where I have less competition. The apples at (6,1) and (4,1) are relatively safe targets.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:**\nHead downward to secure the lower apple cluster. Snake #0 is dominating the upper area with its head start. Focus on the (6,1) and (4,1) apples while avoiding potential traps. Monitor Snake #0's movement - if it moves away from the upper apples, I can reconsider going upward.\n\nDOWN",

The enemy is about to eat the apple at (4,5), so I should focus on other apples. The closest reachable apples are (3,4) and (6,1).\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:**\nFrom (1,6), moving DOWN to (1,5) positions me well to head toward (3,4) while keeping options open.

This would kill me.\n- DOWN: (1,4) \u2192 My snake's body is at (1,4) according to the coordinate list.

Potentially safe.\n\nWait, I need to reconsider this. The board shows my head at (1,5) currently, and I'm looking at moves from that position.\n\n**Corrected Safety Analysis from (1,5):**\n- UP: (1,6) \u2192 My body is at (1,6) - would kill me\n- DOWN: (1,4) \u2192 My body is at (1,4) - would kill me  \n- LEFT: (0,5) \u2192 Empty (safe)\n- RIGHT: (2,5) \u2192 Empty (safe)\n\nSo only LEFT and RIGHT are safe moves.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nThe enemy snake at (3,5) is positioned between me and several apples. Moving RIGHT toward (2,5) brings me closer to the enemy and risks a collision. Moving LEFT to (0,5) keeps me safer and gives me space to maneuver around the left side of the board where there are fewer immediate threats.\n\nFrom (0,5), I could then consider going UP to (0,6) or DOWN to (0,4) to start circling toward the apples at (9,1) or (3,4) while staying clear of the enemy.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:**\nI need to be very careful with my limited safe space. My long body (7 segments) makes movement restrictive. I should prioritize survival by moving to open areas and gradually working my way toward apples while avoiding the enemy snake. The left side of the board offers more breathing room.\n\nLEFT",
