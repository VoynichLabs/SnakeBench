          "rationale": "**START RATIONALE**\n\nCurrent situation analysis:\n- I'm at (1,5) with no body (length 1)\n- Enemy snake #1 is at (2,7) with no body\n- Apples available: (3,4), (0,1), (3,8), (0,5), (9,8)\n\nSafety evaluation for each direction:\n- UP: Would move to (1,6). Is (2,7) adjacent? (2,7) is diagonally adjacent but not directly. The path is clear. Would not hit any body.\n- DOWN: Would move to (1,4). Clear, no obstacles.\n- LEFT: Would move to (0,5). Wait, (0,5) is an apple! But need to check if it's safe. No snake bodies are at (0,5). Enemy is at (2,7). Moving to (0,5) is safe.\n- RIGHT: Would move to (2,5). Is (2,5) clear? Enemy is at (2,7), so (2,5) is 2 cells away from enemy head. No bodies at (2,5). This is safe.\n\nAll four directions appear safe. Now I need to evaluate which move is optimal.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- Turn 0 of 150, early game\n- No body yet, so mobility is maximum\n- I should prioritize apples that are close and accessible\n- Looking at apples: (0,5) is directly adjacent left\n- (3,4) is 2 cells away (down-right)\n- (0,1) is 4 cells away (down-left)\n- (3,8) is 3 cells away (up-right)\n- (9,8) is far (8 cells right, 3 up)\n\nThe closest apple is (0,5) which is LEFT. However, I should also consider the enemy snake at (2,7). If I move LEFT to (0,5), I'll be at (0,5) and the enemy might move toward other apples.\n\nLet me think about the board layout:\n- My head: (1,5)\n- Enemy: (2,7)\n- Apples: (3,4), (0,1), (3,8), (0,5), (9,8)\n\nIf I go LEFT to (0,5), I get the apple immediately (one point). This grows my body to length 2 (head at (0,5), tail at (1,5)).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1,4), I'm moving toward (3,4) apple. But that apple is 2 cells away (diagonally), so I'd need two turns to reach it.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,5), I'm not moving toward any immediate apple, but I could reach (3,4) in one more turn (right then down).\n\nIf I go UP to (1,6), I'm moving toward (3,8) and potentially (0,5) becomes harder to reach.\n\nThe safest and most rewarding immediate move appears to be LEFT to (0,5), grabbing the apple directly. This gives me a point and grows my body, which is good early game positioning.\n\nHowever, I should also consider: what if the enemy snake moves toward my apple? But the enemy is at (2,7), and the apple at (0,5) is 2 cells away for them (left twice then down twice). They could theoretically reach it, but they're further away. I'm right next to it.\n\nActually, wait - let me recalculate distance:\n- From my position (1,5) to (0,5): 1 cell left\n- From enemy (2,7) to (0,5): 2 cells left + 2 cells down = Manhattan distance 4\n\nSo I can reach it in 1 turn, enemy would need 4 turns. I should definitely go for it.\n\nBut let me also verify that (0,5) is not occupied. The board shows:\n- At y=5: \"A 0 . . . . . . . .\" - so (0,5) is 'A' (apple) and (1,5) is '0' (me). Perfect, so (0,5) has an apple.\n\nMoving LEFT to (0,5) means:\n- I'll eat the apple\n- My head moves to (0,5)\n- My body will temporarily be (1,5) (the old head)\n- Next turn I'll have a body of length 1\n\nThis seems like the optimal move. I get an immediate point and position myself on the left edge of the board.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: is there any scenario where going LEFT could be problematic?\n- If the enemy moves LEFT (to 1,7) and then DOWN (to 1,6) next turn, they could potentially approach\n- But (0,5) is on the edge, which might limit my escape routes\n\nAlternative - going DOWN to (1,4):\n- This moves me toward (3,4) apple\n- (1,4) appears empty\n- But I don't get an apple this turn\n\nAlternative - going RIGHT to (2,5):\n- Moves me toward (3,4) and potentially (3,8)\n- Keeps me more central on the board\n- No immediate apple gain\n\nAlternative - going UP to (1,6):\n- Moves me toward (3,8)\n- But (3,8) is further\n- No immediate apple\n\nI think the clear best move is LEFT to grab (0,5). It's a guaranteed point, and in early game with no body, having one point is significant.\n\nOne more consideration: moving to the edge (x=0). The board is 10x10 (0-9), so x=0 is a valid coordinate. I won't die by going off the board. Being on the edge reduces my future options slightly (can't go left anymore), but with a body of only length 1, I can easily maneuver next turn.\n\nFinal decision: LEFT to (0,5) to collect the apple.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Let\u2019s break this down step by step.  \n\n**Current position:** My head is at (2, 7).  \n**Apples:** (3, 4), (0, 1), (3, 8), (0, 5), (9, 8).  \n**Enemy snake head:** (1, 5).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Check each direction for immediate death:**  \n\n- **UP** \u2192 (2, 8) \u2192 inside board, no snake body there now, enemy not there now. Safe for now.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2, 6) \u2192 inside board, no body there now. Safe for now.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1, 7) \u2192 inside board, no body there now. Safe for now.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3, 7) \u2192 inside board, no body there now. Safe for now.  \n\nAll four moves are *immediately* safe in terms of board boundaries and current snake positions.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy movement:**  \n\nEnemy head at (1, 5). Possible moves: UP to (1, 6), DOWN to (1, 4), LEFT to (0, 5), RIGHT to (2, 5).  \n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (2, 6), enemy could move UP to (1, 6) \u2014 no collision.  \nIf I move **LEFT** to (1, 7), enemy could move UP to (1, 6) \u2014 no collision.  \nIf I move **RIGHT** to (3, 7), enemy far away \u2014 no collision.  \nIf I move **UP** to (2, 8), enemy far away \u2014 no collision.  \n\nSo no immediate head-on collision risk since enemy is 2+ cells away in all cases.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and future options:**  \n\nClosest apple: (3, 8) is at distance \u0394x=1, \u0394y=1 \u2192 Manhattan distance 2.  \nOther apple: (0, 5) is \u0394x=2, \u0394y=2 \u2192 distance 4.  \nApple at (3, 4) is \u0394x=1, \u0394y=3 \u2192 distance 4.  \n\n**UP** to (2, 8) \u2192 gets closer to apple at (3, 8) (distance 1 horizontally).  \n**RIGHT** to (3, 7) \u2192 gets closer to apple at (3, 8) (distance 1 vertically) and also closer to (3, 4).  \n\nBut (3, 8) is above (3, 7), so from (3, 7) next turn could go UP to (3, 8) to eat it.  \n\nFrom (2, 8) next turn could go RIGHT to (3, 8) to eat it.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after move:**  \n\nCheck from each candidate position how many safe moves next turn:  \n\n**UP to (2, 8):**  \nFrom (2, 8), possible moves: UP (2,9) safe, DOWN (2,7) safe (currently tail, but tail moves away), LEFT (1,8) safe, RIGHT (3,8) safe unless enemy moves there? Enemy too far to reach (3,8) in 1 move from (1,5). All 4 moves safe next turn.  \n\n**RIGHT to (3, 7):**  \nFrom (3,7): UP (3,8) safe, DOWN (3,6) safe, LEFT (2,7) safe (tail cell now empty), RIGHT (4,7) safe. Also 4 safe moves next turn.  \n\nBoth are fine.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Avoid boxing myself:**  \n\nCurrently no body, so no risk of trapping yet. But moving toward center keeps options open.  \n\nRIGHT \u2192 (3,7) is more central than (2,8).  \nUP \u2192 (2,8) is near top edge (y=9 next).  \n\nEdge reduces future UP moves but not immediately. Still, I prefer to stay away from edges early game to keep more escape routes.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Plan for next few turns:**  \n\nI want to eat apple at (3, 8) soon. If I go UP now to (2,8), next turn RIGHT to (3,8) eats it.  \nIf I go RIGHT now to (3,7), next turn UP to (3,8) eats it.  \n\nDifference: from (3,7) I\u2019m also closer to other apples (3,4) and more central.  \nFrom (2,8) I\u2019m closer to top edge but still fine.  \n\nBut enemy at (1,5) might go for (0,5) apple or (3,4). They are far from (3,8) so I can probably get it safely.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose **RIGHT** to (3,7) because:  \n- Central position  \n- Next turn UP to apple (3,8)  \n- More future options in multiple directions  \n- Equal immediate safety  \n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,7), move UP to (3,8) to eat apple if still there, but check enemy movement first next turn. Keep an eye on snake #0\u2019s position to avoid head-on collisions. Prefer paths that keep at least 2 safe moves after eating to avoid trapping.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

And the description says \"Body: [(1,5)]\" which means I have a body segment at (1,5)? Wait, that can't be right if I'm at (1,5). Let me re-read.\n\n\"My snake (ID: 0): Head: (0, 5), Body: [(1, 5)]\"\n\nWait, this is contradictory to the board state. Let me check the board again:\n\"5 A 0 . . . . . . . .\" - This shows (0,5) as 'A' and (1,5) as '0'.\n\nBut the description says my head is (0,5). There's a discrepancy. Let me trust the textual description over the board rendering for my position.\n\nSo:\n- My head: (0,5)\n- My body: [(1,5)]\n- This makes sense - head at (0,5), body segment at (1,5)\n- The board shows (0,5) as 'A' - but if I'm already there, that apple should be gone? Unless I just moved there and haven't eaten it yet?\n\nActually, re-reading: \"Turn: 1 / 150\" and \"Your snake (ID 0) apples: 1\". So I already have 1 apple. The board might be showing the apple at (0,5) from before I ate it, or the rendering is just showing all apple locations regardless.\n\nLet me assume my head is at (0,5) and body at (1,5). That's length 2.\n\nEnemy snake #1: Head at (3,7), no body.\n\nApples: (3,4), (0,1), (3,8), (9,8), (1,1)\n\nBoard state shows:\n- y=9: all dots\n- y=8: . . . A . . . . . A  (so apples at (3,8) and (9,8))\n- y=7: . . . 1 . . . . . .  (enemy head at (3,7))\n- y=6: all dots\n- y=5: A 0 . . . . . . . .  (my head at (1,5)? Wait, '0' is at x=1,y=5, and 'A' is at x=0,y=5)\n- y=4: . . . A . . . . . .  (apple at (3,4))\n- y=3: all dots\n- y=2: all dots\n- y=1: A A . . . . . . . .  (apples at (0,1) and (1,1))\n- y=0: all dots\n\nThere's definitely confusion between the text and board. Let me re-parse the text description carefully:\n\n\"Your snake (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (0, 5)\n  - Body: [(1, 5)]\n  - Apples collected: 1\"\n\nSo head is (0,5). Body is (1,5). That's a length-2 snake. But the board shows '0' at (1,5). Maybe the board rendering uses '0' to represent the head and 'T' for tail? But the text says the body is just [(1,5)] which would be the tail.\n\nLet me check the board key again: \"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\" are column markers. The rows show characters.\n\nLooking at y=5 row: \"A 0 . . . . . . . .\"\nThis means:\n- (0,5): 'A'\n- (1,5): '0'\n- (2,5): '.'\n- etc.\n\nSo if my head is at (0,5) according to text, but the board shows '0' at (1,5), there's a mismatch. However, the textual description also says \"My last move information: LEFT\" which means I moved LEFT in the previous turn.\n\nIf I moved LEFT and my head is now at (0,5), then I must have been at (1,5) before. So:\n- Previous position: (1,5)\n- Moved LEFT\n- New position: (0,5)\n\nAnd the text says my body is at (1,5). That matches! So after moving from (1,5) to (0,5), my head is at (0,5) and my body is at (1,5). The board is likely showing the state BEFORE my move, or the '0' on the board represents my body/tail, not my head.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: maybe the board is showing the current state and I'm misreading. Let me look at the \"Apples at\" list again:\nApples at: (3, 4), (0, 1), (3, 8), (9, 8), (1, 1)\n\nBut the board shows apples at (0,5), (3,4), (3,8), (9,8), (0,1), (1,1). There's an extra apple at (0,5) that's not in the list.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let me work with the textual description only:\n- My head: (0,5)\n- My body: [(1,5)]\n- Enemy head: (3,7), no body\n- Apples: (3,4), (0,1), (3,8), (9,8), (1,1)\n\nSo my valid moves from (0,5) are:\n- UP to (0,6)\n- DOWN to (0,4)\n- LEFT to (-1,5) - INVALID (off board)\n- RIGHT to (1,5) - but that's my body! I would die.\n\nWait, if my body is at (1,5), then moving RIGHT would hit my own body. That's suicide.\n\nBut the board shows '0' at (1,5) and 'A' at (0,5). If I'm at (0,5), then moving RIGHT to (1,5) would hit... what? The board shows '0' there. But if that's my body, yes, I'd die.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe the board rendering is accurate and the text description is slightly off about which cell is head vs body.\n\nLooking at board row 5: \"A 0 . . . . . . . .\"\nAnd the pattern: head is usually denoted differently. In the enemy snake, it's just \"1\" at (3,7).\n\nMaybe '0' and '1' represent the snakes themselves (their heads), and the board doesn't show bodies unless they're separate cells.\n\nLet me try another interpretation:\n- My head is at (1,5) (where '0' is)\n- The apple at (0,5) is still there ('A')\n- My body is at (0,5) from a previous move? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, re-reading the body description: \"Body: [(1,5)]\" - this is a list of one cell. If my head is at (0,5) and body is at (1,5), that's a two-segment snake pointing right.\n\nBut the board shows '0' at (1,5). Maybe '0' means \"snake 0's body\" not head.\n\nLet me look at enemy: \"Head: (3,7), Body: none\" and board shows '1' at (3,7). So '1' is the enemy head.\n\nSo maybe:\n- '0' on board = my head (at (1,5) according to board)\n- '1' on board = enemy head (at (3,7))\n\nBut text says my head is (0,5). So there's definitely a conflict.\n\nLet me check the last move info again: \"LEFT\" - so I moved left.\nIf I moved LEFT and ended up at (0,5), I must have started at (1,5).\nSo after the move, my head is at (0,5).\nThe board might be showing the state BEFORE the move, or the '0' is my old position.\n\nYou know what, let me just go with the textual description because that's what was provided as the authoritative source:\n- Head: (0,5)\n- Body: [(1,5)]\n- Length: 2\n\nFrom (0,5), possible moves:\n- UP: (0,6) - should be empty\n- DOWN: (0,4) - should be empty  \n- LEFT: (-1,5) - off board, die\n- RIGHT: (1,5) - my own body, die\n\nSo only UP and DOWN are safe.\n\nNow, where are the apples?\n(3,4) - 3 cells away (right 3, down 1)\n(0,1) - 4 cells away (down 4)\n(3,8) - 3 cells away (right 3, up 3)\n(9,8) - 9 cells away (right 9, up 3)\n(1,1) - 4 cells away (right 1, down 4)\n\nThe closest reachable apple is either (3,4) or (3,8), both 3 cells away. But I can't reach them this turn.\n\nWait, but I need to check the board again to verify what's between me and these apples.\n\nIf I'm at (0,5), board shows row 5 as \"A 0 . . . . . . . .\" which is confusing.\n\nLet me try yet another interpretation: What if the board is showing the CURRENT state, and '0' at (1,5) is indeed my current head, and the textual description has an error?\n\nIf my head is at (1,5):\n- UP: (1,6) - should be empty\n- DOWN: (1,4) - should be empty\n- LEFT: (0,5) - board shows 'A' here, so apple\n- RIGHT: (2,5) - should be empty\n\nAll four directions are potentially safe. And (0,5) is an apple!\n\nThis makes much more sense. The text says \"Head: (0,5)\" but the board shows '0' at (1,5). The text also says \"Body: [(1,5)]\" which would mean body at (1,5) if head is at (0,5). But that creates the suicide problem.\n\nHowever, if head is at (1,5) and body is at (0,5), that's also a two-segment snake, and it fits the board (0 at (1,5), A at (0,5) which would be the tail).\n\nBut the text explicitly says \"Head: (0,5), Body: [(1,5)]\". This is very clear.\n\nLet me re-read the board one more time. Row 5 is: \"A 0 . . . . . . . .\"\n\nCould 'A' at (0,5) represent something other than an apple? No, 'A' is apple.\n\nCould '0' at (1,5) represent something other than my head? The description says \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail\". And in the enemy description, '1' appears at (3,7) which matches their head.\n\nI think the most reasonable interpretation is:\n1. The textual description of my position is correct\n2. The board rendering has '0' representing the head\n3. Therefore, my head is at (1,5), not (0,5)\n4. The text \"Head: (0,5)\" is an error and should be \"(1,5)\"\n5. \"Body: [(1,5)]\" is also an error and should be \"Body: [(0,5)]\" if I just ate an apple there\n\nBut wait, I have 1 apple already. If I just ate an apple at (0,5), my tail would still be at the old position.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n- Start: head at some position\n- Move: direction\n- End: head at new position, tail moves forward\n\nIf I moved LEFT last turn, and my head is now at (0,5), and I ate an apple, my body would be:\n- Head: (0,5)\n- Body: [old head position]\n\nIf old head was (1,5), then body is [(1,5)].\nThe board shows 'A' at (0,5) and '0' at (1,5). So if I'm at (0,5) now, the board's '0' at (1,5) would be my old head, and 'A' at (0,5) would be... but I just ate it!\n\nI think the board is pre-move state. So:\n- Before my move: I was at (1,5), apple at (0,5)\n- I moved LEFT to (0,5), ate the apple\n- Now my head is at (0,5), body includes (1,5)\n- The board shown is the pre-move state\n\nThat makes sense! So I can trust the board for seeing apple locations and enemy positions, but my current position is as described in text.\n\nCurrent state based on text:\n- My head: (0,5)\n- My body: [(1,5)]\n- Length: 2\n\nFrom (0,5), valid moves:\n- UP to (0,6): check board row 6 is all dots, so empty\n- DOWN to (0,4): check board row 4 is \". . . A . . . . . .\", so (0,4) is empty\n- LEFT to (-1,5): off board, die\n- RIGHT to (1,5): my body, die\n\nSo only UP and DOWN are safe.\n\nApples from text: (3,4), (0,1), (3,8), (9,8), (1,1)\n\nWhere am I relative to these?\n- (0,6): no apple\n- (0,4): no apple\n\nNeither move gets an apple this turn. But I need to move toward future apples.\n\nWhich direction gives better future options?\n\nIf I go UP to (0,6):\n- Next moves from (0,6): UP(0,7), DOWN(0,5) [my tail], LEFT(off), RIGHT(1,6)\n- (1,6) is empty per board row 6\n- I'm moving toward (3,8) and (9,8) but away from (3,4) and (0,1)\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0,4):\n- Next moves from (0,4): UP(0,5) [my tail], DOWN(0,3), LEFT(off), RIGHT(1,4)\n- (0,3) is empty per board row 3\n- (1,4) is empty per board row 4 (\". . . A . . . . . .\" at row 4, so (1,4) is the second dot)\n- I'm moving toward (0,1) and (3,4)\n\n(0,1) is directly below me (4 cells down). (3,4) is 3 cells right.\n\nGoing DOWN seems better because:\n1. I'm heading toward (0,1) which is relatively close\n2. I stay near the left side which might be less contested\n3. From (0,4), I can then go right toward (3,4)\n\nGoing UP:\n1. Leads me toward (3,8) and (9,8) which are far\n2. (0,5) would be my tail next turn, so I can't go back down\n3. I might get stuck near the top edge\n\nSo DOWN to (0,4) appears to be the better strategic choice.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the board interpretation. If I'm at (0,5) and my body is at (1,5), then the board row 5 showing \"A 0 . . .\" means:\n- (0,5): 'A' - this is where I am now (head)\n- (1,5): '0' - this is my body\n\nBut the text says \"Body: [(1,5)]\" which matches.\n\nSo the 'A' at (0,5) on the board is just a rendering artifact from before I ate it, or it's showing my head as 'A'? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me just trust the textual position and work from there. I've established that only UP and DOWN are valid moves, and DOWN seems strategically better.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider the board one more time. What if '0' and '1' on the board represent the snakes, and the textual description is giving me extra detail (like which specific cell is head vs body)?\n\nIf board shows '0' at (1,5), that could mean \"some part of snake 0 is here\". The textual description clarifies that (1,5) is the body and (0,5) is the head.\n\nBut then what's at (0,5)? The board shows 'A'. If that's my head, it would show '0', not 'A'. So either:\n1. The board is wrong about my position\n2. The text is wrong about my position\n3. I'm misunderstanding the board format\n\nLet me look at the board header: \"Board state:\" then the grid. At the bottom: \" 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\" - these are x-coordinates.\n\nRow labels on left: 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 - these are y-coordinates.\n\nSo the grid is (x,y) with x from left to right (0-9), y from bottom to top (0-9).\n\nRow 5 (y=5): \"A 0 . . . . . . . .\"\nThis means:\n- (0,5): 'A' (apple)\n- (1,5): '0' (snake 0)\n- (2,5): '.' (empty)\n- ...\n\nSo snake 0 is at (1,5). The textual description saying \"Head: (0,5)\" must be an error. It should be \"Head: (1,5)\".\n\nAnd \"Body: [(1,5)]\" would also be wrong if head is at (1,5). It should be \"Body: []\" or if I just grew, \"Body: [old_position]\".\n\nLet me think about my last move: I moved LEFT.\nIf I moved LEFT and ended up at (1,5), I must have been at (2,5) before.\nBut then my body would be at (2,5), not (1,5) or (0,5).\n\nThis is too confusing. Let me make a decision based on the most consistent interpretation:\n\n**Interpretation**: The board shows '0' at (1,5), so my head is at (1,5). The textual description has an error in the head coordinates. The body list might be empty or wrong. Since I have 1 apple already, my length is at least 2. If I just ate an apple at (0,5), my body would be at (1,5) and my head at (0,5), but that contradicts the board showing '0' at (1,5).\n\n**Alternative**: The textual description is correct, and the board's 'A' at (0,5) is my head (rendered as 'A' because I just ate? But that doesn't make sense), and '0' at (1,5) is my body. So I'm at (0,5).\n\nGiven the explicit textual statement \"Head: (0,5)\", I will trust that and work from (0,5).\n\nFrom (0,5), safe moves: UP, DOWN (LEFT and RIGHT are invalid/blocked).\n\nNow, which is better? Let me analyze the board from (0,5) looking at rows:\n\nIf I go UP to (0,6):\n- Board row 6: \". . . . . . . . . .\" - all empty\n- From (0,6), next moves: UP(0,7), DOWN(0,5)[tail], LEFT(off), RIGHT(1,6)\n- (1,6) is empty per row 6\n- (0,7): row 7 shows \". . . 1 . . . . . .\" so (0,7) is empty\n- This gives me 2 safe forward options next turn\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0,4):\n- Board row 4: \". . . A . . . . . .\" so (0,4) is empty\n- From (0,4), next moves: UP(0,5)[tail], DOWN(0,3), LEFT(off), RIGHT(1,4)\n- (0,3): row 3 is all dots, so empty\n- (1,4): row 4 shows (1,4) is the second dot, so empty\n- This gives me 2 safe forward options next turn\n\nBoth directions give 2 options next turn. Now let's look at apples:\n\nCurrent position: (0,5)\nApples: (0,1), (1,1), (3,4), (3,8), (9,8)\n\nIf I go UP:\n- Position: (0,6)\n- Distance to (0,1): 5 down\n- To (1,1): 5 down, 1 right = 6\n- To (3,4): 3 right, 2 down = 5\n- To (3,8): 3 right, 2 up = 5\n- To (9,8): 9 right, 2 up = 11\n\nIf I go DOWN:\n- Position: (0,4)\n- To (0,1): 3 down\n- To (1,1): 3 down, 1 right = 4\n- To (3,4): 3 right = 3\n- To (3,8): 3 right, 4 up = 7\n- To (9,8): 9 right, 4 up = 13\n\nGoing DOWN puts me closer to the cluster of apples at (0,1), (1,1), and (3,4). These are the nearest apples.\n\nAlso, consider enemy snake at (3,7). If I go DOWN, I'm moving away from the enemy (vertical distance increases). If I go UP, I'm moving toward the enemy's vertical area (but still far away).\n\nStrategic choice: DOWN to (0,4). This positions me to chase the closer apples and keeps me away from the enemy initially.\n\nWait, but let me verify one more time that (0,4) is actually safe and contains no surprise obstacles. Board row 4: \". . . A . . . . . .\" - yes, (0,4) is the first character which is '.', so it's empty.\n\nActually, hold on. Let me recount the characters in row 4: \". . . A . . . . . .\" - that's 10 characters. Let me index them:\n0: .\n1: .\n2: .\n3: A\n4: .\n5: .\n6: .\n7: .\n8: .\n9: .\n\nSo (0,4) is '.', (1,4) is '.', (2,4) is '.', (3,4) is 'A'.\n\nYes, (0,4) is empty. Good.\n\nSo my decision is DOWN.\n\nBut wait, I just realized something. What if I'm actually at (1,5) and the text is wrong? Let me do a quick check of that scenario.\n\nScenario: Head at (1,5)\n- Moves: UP(1,6), DOWN(1,4), LEFT(0,5), RIGHT(2,5)\n- Board check: all these are empty per respective rows\n- (0,5) is an apple! So LEFT gets an apple immediately.\n\nThis would be a much better move if it's valid.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me try to find the most logical resolution:\n\n1. Text says I have 1 apple\n2. Text says my last move was LEFT\n3. If I moved LEFT and have 1 apple, I likely just ate an apple by moving left\n4. Board shows an apple at (0,5)\n5. If I was at (1,5) and moved LEFT to (0,5), I would eat that apple\n6. After eating, head is at (0,5), body includes (1,5)\n7. Board still shows the old state where apple was at (0,5) and I was at (1,5)\n\nSo the board is pre-move, text is post-move.\n\nTherefore, I am at (0,5), body at (1,5), and the apple at (0,5) is now gone.\n\nFrom (0,5), only UP and DOWN are safe. DOWN is strategically better.\n\nBut wait, there's one more interpretation. What if the text \"Body: [(1,5)]\" means that (1,5) is the only body segment, but it's actually part of my body that's behind me? If I'm at (0,5) and my body is at (1,5), that would mean my body extends to the right, which means I must have been moving RIGHT previously? But the text says I moved LEFT.\n\nIf I moved LEFT and ended at (0,5), and my body is at (1,5), that's consistent.\n\nI think I've overthought this enough. Let me commit to being at (0,5) and move DOWN to (0,4). This is safe and strategic.\n\nActually, one final sanity check: what does the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" section say? \"LEFT\" - so I did move left. And \"START LAST RATIONALE\" discusses being at (1,5) and moving left to (0,5) to get an apple. So the rationale confirms I was at (1,5) and moved to (0,5).\n\nTherefore, current position is definitely (0,5), and I have a body segment at (1,5).\n\nFrom (0,5), safe moves: UP, DOWN.\nBest strategic move: DOWN.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Safe.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 6) \u2192 inside board, empty. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 7) \u2192 inside board, empty (my previous head position, but my tail is gone since length 1).

Possible enemy moves:  \nUP to (0, 6), DOWN to (0, 4), LEFT out of bounds \u2192 invalid, RIGHT to (1, 5) but that\u2019s its own body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo enemy can only move UP or DOWN.  \n\nIf enemy moves UP to (0, 6), distance from my possible moves is large.  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (0, 4), also far.  \n\nNo risk of head-on collision this turn regardless of my move.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \n\nClosest apple is (3, 8) directly above me. Moving UP eats it immediately.  \nOther apples: (3, 4) is 3 cells down, (0, 1) far, (9, 8) far, (1, 1) far.  \n\nEating an apple early is good \u2014 but need to think about safety after eating, because I\u2019ll have a body segment next turn.  \n\nIf I eat (3, 8):  \nNext turn my head will be at (3, 8), body at [(3, 7)].  \nFrom (3, 8), possible moves:  \n- UP to (3, 9) safe  \n- DOWN to (3, 7) my body \u2192 death  \n- LEFT to (2, 8) safe  \n- RIGHT to (4, 8) safe  \n\nSo after eating, DOWN is blocked by my new body, but still 3 safe moves remain. That\u2019s fine.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Compare alternatives:**  \n\nIf I don\u2019t eat apple now:  \n- Going DOWN or LEFT or RIGHT leaves apple at (3, 8) for enemy? Enemy can\u2019t reach it next turn (enemy at (0,5) \u2192 at least 3 moves away).  \nBut if I delay eating, enemy could move toward it in future turns.  \n\nBest to grab it now while safe and secure a point.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future planning after eating:**  \n\nAfter eating apple at (3, 8), my length becomes 2. Next turn I should avoid going backwards into my new body at (3, 7).  \nFrom (3, 8), I\u2019ll have UP, LEFT, RIGHT safe. I can plan to go toward center or toward another apple like (3, 4) later.  \n\nEnemy is far away, so no immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Conclusion:**  \n\nUP is safe, gets an apple, leaves multiple options next turn.  \nNo reason to avoid it \u2014 the only risk would be if enemy could also reach (3, 8) this turn, but they can\u2019t.  \n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (3, 8), avoid DOWN into own body.

Safe.  \n\nSo DOWN is not an option.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy possible moves this turn:**  \n\nEnemy head at (0, 4), body at (0, 5).  \nEnemy moves:  \n- UP to (0, 5) \u2192 its own body \u2192 death \u2192 unlikely unless suicidal.  \n- DOWN to (0, 3) \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (-1, 4) \u2192 off board \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 4) \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo enemy will likely move DOWN or RIGHT.  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (1, 4), it gets closer to apple at (1, 1) but still far from me.  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk for me on any safe move, because enemy is far away.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \n\nClosest apple to me: (3, 4) is 4 steps away (3 down, but DOWN is blocked).  \n(9, 8) is 6 steps away.  \n(8, 4) is 5 steps away.  \n(0, 1) far.  \n(1, 1) far.  \n\nNo apple is immediately adjacent this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after this move:**  \n\nFrom (3, 8):  \n- If I go UP to (3, 9):  \n  Next turn from (3, 9), possible moves: UP off board (death), DOWN to (3, 8) safe (empty then), LEFT to (2, 9) safe, RIGHT to (4, 9) safe \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n- If I go LEFT to (2, 8):  \n  Next turn from (2, 8), moves: UP to (2, 9) safe, DOWN to (2, 7) safe, LEFT to (1, 8) safe, RIGHT to (3, 8) safe \u2192 all 4 safe.  \n\n- If I go RIGHT to (4, 8):  \n  Next turn from (4, 8), moves: UP to (4, 9) safe, DOWN to (4, 7) safe, LEFT to (3, 8) safe, RIGHT to (5, 8) safe \u2192 all 4 safe.  \n\nSo LEFT and RIGHT give more options next turn than UP (since UP from (3, 9) eliminates UP next turn).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Strategic positioning:**  \n\nEnemy is in the left side (0, 4). Going LEFT toward (2, 8) gets me slightly closer to left-side apples but also closer to enemy eventually. Going RIGHT toward (4, 8) moves toward center and apple at (8, 4) direction.  \n\nGiven that my body is at (3, 7), I want to avoid boxing myself near my tail in future moves. Moving UP to (3, 9) puts me near top edge, which reduces future UP moves.  \n\nBest for flexibility: LEFT or RIGHT.  \n\nSince apple at (3, 4) is below me but DOWN is blocked now, I could plan to circle around to it later. Going RIGHT now opens path toward apple (8, 4) and keeps center access.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose:**  \n\nRIGHT seems slightly better than LEFT because:  \n- It moves toward more apples ((8, 4), (9, 8)) long-term.  \n- It keeps distance from enemy currently at left.  \n- Equal flexibility next turn as LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 8), avoid moving back into (3, 8) unless necessary. Prefer DOWN toward apple (3, 4) or RIGHT toward (8, 4). Watch enemy movement.  \n\nRIGHT",

But need to ensure tail moves away.  \n\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 8) heads toward apples (8, 4) and (9, 8), but (9, 8) is on same row, so I could reach it faster. However, moving toward (9, 8) risks top-right corner later.  \n\nGiven both DOWN and RIGHT have equal immediate safety and next-turn flexibility, I prefer DOWN because:  \n- It moves toward apple (3, 4) and also toward other apples on lower half.  \n- It avoids top edge which reduces options.  \n- It keeps distance from enemy currently at left side.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 7), consider moving LEFT to (3, 7) if safe, to start approaching apple (3, 4).

          "rationale": "I need to analyze the board state and my current position to determine the best move.\n\nLet me first understand my current position and the board:\n- My head is at (0, 3)\n- My body is at (0, 4)\n- I'm moving from (0, 3) to some direction\n- Apples at: (3, 4), (0, 1), (9, 8), (1, 1), (8, 4)\n\nLet me check which moves are safe:\n1. **LEFT**: (0, 3) \u2192 (-1, 3) - This is off the board (x must be 0-9), so this KILLS me. \u274c\n2. **RIGHT**: (0, 3) \u2192 (1, 3) - This is on the board. Let me check if there's a snake there. Looking at the board state, row 3 shows: \"0 . . . . . . . . .\" at position (0, 3) is my head. Position (1, 3) is empty (represented by '.'). So RIGHT is safe. \u2713\n3. **UP**: (0, 3) \u2192 (0, 4) - This is where my body is! My body is at (0, 4). Moving into my own body kills me. \u274c\n4. **DOWN**: (0, 3) \u2192 (0, 2) - This is on the board. Looking at row 2: \". . . . . . . . . .\" - all empty. So DOWN is safe. \u2713\n\nSo safe moves are: RIGHT and DOWN.\n\nNow, which is better strategically?\n\n**RIGHT to (1, 3):**\n- Positions me near the apple at (3, 4) - distance 2 moves\n- Positions me near the apple at (1, 1) - distance 2 moves\n- Opens up more of the board for future movement\n- Doesn't put me in a corner\n\n**DOWN to (0, 2):**\n- Positions me near the apple at (0, 1) - distance 1 move\n- Also near (1, 1) - distance 2 moves\n- But keeps me on the edge of the board\n\nLooking at the apples:\n- (0, 1) is very close if I go DOWN\n- (1, 1) is also accessible\n- (3, 4) is a bit further but might be contested\n\nThe enemy snake #1 is at (4, 8) with body at (3, 8), which is far away from these apple clusters.\n\nI think RIGHT is the better move because:\n1. It moves me into the interior of the board where I have more options\n2. It keeps me close to multiple apples\n3. It avoids potentially getting trapped against the left wall\n4. From (1, 3), I can go to (1, 2) then (1, 1) for the apple, or go to (2, 3) then (3, 4) for that apple\n\nStrategic plan: From (1, 3), I'll have options to go after the apple at (1, 1) by going DOWN twice, or go after (3, 4) by going RIGHT twice. This gives me flexibility.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. If I go DOWN to (0, 2), then I can go DOWN again to (0, 1) to get that apple immediately. That's a guaranteed apple next turn if no one else takes it.\n\nBut if I go RIGHT to (1, 3), I might not be able to get to any apple as quickly.\n\nHowever, looking at the turn count (3/150) and scores (I have 1 apple, enemy has 1 apple), I'm not in a desperate rush. Getting to the interior board is more important for long-term survival.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. Going RIGHT to (1, 3) is better because:\n- It gives me more maneuvering room\n- From (1, 3), I can still reach (1, 1) in 2 moves by going DOWN twice\n- I can also reach (3, 4) in 2 moves by going RIGHT twice\n- The board is open in that direction\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 2), I'm still on the edge, and while (0, 1) is close, I'm limiting my future options.\n\nTherefore, I'll go RIGHT.\n\nWait, one more consideration: Could I be moving into a trap? Let me check the enemy. Enemy is at (4,8) with body (3,8). They're far away. No immediate collision risk.\n\nAlso, I need to consider what the enemy might do. But with the information given, I can only control my own move.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT is the best move for maintaining board control and options.\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. Looking at the last move rationale, they moved DOWN from (0,5) to (0,4) but now the board shows head at (0,3) and body at (0,4). This means the snake has grown. The previous move was DOWN, which means they were at (0,4) before. But wait, the head is now at (0,3)? That's confusing...\n\nLet me re-read: \"My head is at (0, 5) and my body is at (1, 5)\" ... \"I just moved left to eat the apple at (0, 5)\" ... \"going DOWN to (0, 4) is the better strategic choice\"\n\nSo the last move was to go from (0,5) to (0,4)? No wait: \"I just moved left\" - that would be from (1,5) to (0,5). Then \"going DOWN\" would be from (0,5) to (0,4).\n\nBut the current state shows head at (0,3) and body at (0,4). This suggests the current state is after multiple moves, or there's something I'm misunderstanding.\n\nLet me look at the current board:\n```\n 4 T . . A . . . . A .\n 3 0 . . . . . . . . .\n```\n\nAt (0,4) there's a 'T' (tail), and at (0,3) there's a '0' (head). So the body goes (0,3) \u2192 (0,4). \n\nSo I need to move FROM (0,3). My options are:\n- LEFT: (-1,3) - dead\n- RIGHT: (1,3) - safe\n- UP: (0,4) - this is my body, so dead\n- DOWN: (0,2) - safe\n\nSo I'm back to RIGHT vs DOWN.\n\nGiven that (0,1) is an apple and it's only 2 cells down, but (1,1) is also an apple and I can reach it in 2 moves from (1,3), I think the key is to get off the wall.\n\nActually, you know what, let me go DOWN to (0,2). Why? Because:\n1. (0,1) is a guaranteed apple I can reach in 1 more move\n2. After eating that apple, I'll be at (0,1) and can then decide to go RIGHT to (1,1) for another apple\n3. This path is more certain and safer\n\nFrom (1,3), I'd be closer to (1,1) but I'd need to go DOWN twice. From (0,2), I go DOWN once to (0,1) for an apple, then I'm at (0,1) and can go RIGHT to (1,1) for another apple.\n\nThe sequence DOWN \u2192 DOWN gets me two apples in 2 moves.\nFrom (1,3), I'd need DOWN \u2192 DOWN to get to (1,1), which is the same.\n\nBut from (0,2), I also have the option to go to (0,1) which is closer than from (1,3).\n\nWait, from (0,3) going DOWN to (0,2), then DOWN to (0,1) gets me the apple at (0,1).\nFrom (0,3) going RIGHT to (1,3), then DOWN to (1,2), then DOWN to (1,1) gets me the apple at (1,1).\n\nSo DOWN gives me faster access to (0,1), RIGHT gives me faster access to (1,1) but through a longer path.\n\nBoth apples at (0,1) and (1,1) are available. I should prioritize the one that gives me better positioning after eating.\n\nIf I eat (0,1), I'm at (0,1) with body (0,2) and (0,3). I can then go RIGHT to (1,1) for the second apple.\nIf I eat (1,1), I'm at (1,1) with body (1,2), (1,3), etc. I can then go LEFT to (0,1) for the first apple.\n\nThe difference is minimal, but going DOWN to (0,2) keeps me on track for a more direct path to (0,1).\n\nActually, let me think about the enemy. The enemy is at (4,8). They can't reach these apples quickly. So I have time.\n\nLet me also consider the board edges. Being at (0,3) on the left edge, if I go RIGHT, I'm at (1,3) which gives me more options. If I go DOWN to (0,2), I'm still on the edge but one step closer to the bottom.\n\nThe bottom row (y=0) is empty, so going DOWN is safe from board constraints.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT because:\n1. It gets me off the immediate left wall\n2. It gives me more maneuvering room\n3. From (1,3), I have equal access to both apple clusters\n4. Being on the edge is generally more dangerous long-term\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT\n\nActually, wait. I just realized something. Looking at the board again:\n```\n 1 A A . . . . . . . .\n```\n\nAt y=1, there are apples at (0,1) and (1,1). So two apples adjacent to each other!\n\nIf I go DOWN from (0,3) to (0,2), then DOWN to (0,1) to eat that apple, I'll be at (0,1) with body (0,2), (0,3). Then I can go RIGHT to (1,1) to eat the second apple.\n\nIf I go RIGHT from (0,3) to (1,3), then DOWN to (1,2), then DOWN to (1,1) to eat that apple, I'll be at (1,1) with body (1,2), (1,3), (0,3)... wait no, let me trace:\n- Start: head (0,3), body [(0,4)]\n- RIGHT: head (1,3), body [(0,3), (0,4)]? No, the body should be the old head position.\n\nActually, after moving RIGHT:\n- New head: (1,3)\n- New body: [(0,3), (0,4)]\n\nThen DOWN:\n- New head: (1,2)\n- New body: [(1,3), (0,3), (0,4)]\n\nThen DOWN to (1,1) to eat apple:\n- New head: (1,1)\n- New body: [(1,2), (1,3), (0,3), (0,4)]\n\nThen LEFT to (0,1) for the other apple:\n- New head: (0,1)\n- New body: [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (0,3), (0,4)]\n\nThis works, but the path is longer.\n\nIf I go DOWN:\n- Start: head (0,3), body [(0,4)]\n- DOWN: head (0,2), body [(0,3), (0,4)]\n- DOWN to (0,1) for apple: head (0,1), body [(0,2), (0,3), (0,4)]\n- RIGHT to (1,1) for apple: head (1,1), body [(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4)]\n\nThis is more direct and gets me two apples in 3 moves total (current move + 2 more).\n\nBut wait, I'm only making ONE move now. The question is which SINGLE move to make.\n\nBoth paths work. Which is better?\n\nFrom (0,2) [after DOWN], I can go DOWN to (0,1) or RIGHT to (1,2).\nFrom (1,3) [after RIGHT], I can go DOWN to (1,2) or LEFT to (0,3) but that's into my body.\n\nActually, from (1,3), I could go RIGHT to (2,3) or DOWN to (1,2). LEFT would be back to (0,3) which will be empty after I move away? No wait, after moving RIGHT, my body will be at (0,3), so I can't go LEFT back to (0,3).\n\nFrom (0,2) [after DOWN], I can go DOWN to (0,1), RIGHT to (1,2), or LEFT would be off board, UP back to (0,3) which will be in my body.\n\nSo both give me 2 safe options. But from (0,2), one option (DOWN) leads to an apple. From (1,3), both options (DOWN and RIGHT) don't immediately lead to apples.\n\nWait, from (1,3) going RIGHT to (2,3) doesn't lead to an apple. From (1,3) going DOWN to (1,2) doesn't lead to an apple. So I'd need two more moves to get to an apple.\n\nFrom (0,2) going DOWN to (0,1) gets an apple immediately (next turn).\n\nSo DOWN gives me faster apple access.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy. They might go for those apples too!\n\nThe enemy is at (4,8) with body (3,8). To get to (0,1) or (1,1), they'd need many moves. So they can't beat me to these apples.\n\nGiven that, I think DOWN is the better immediate move because it puts me on a clear path to collect two apples quickly.\n\nWait, but I'm at (0,3). If I go DOWN to (0,2), I'm not eating an apple this turn. The apple is at (0,1), one more step away.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1,3), I'm also not eating an apple this turn.\n\nSo neither move gets me an apple immediately. The question is which position is better for getting apples soon.\n\nFrom (0,2), I can get to (0,1) in 1 move.\nFrom (1,3), I can get to (1,1) in 2 moves, or to (3,4) in 2 moves.\n\nSo DOWN is faster for one apple, but RIGHT opens up more apples.\n\nLet me count total apples reachable:\n- From (0,2): (0,1) in 1 move, (1,1) in 2 moves, (3,4) in 4 moves\n- From (1,3): (1,1) in 2 moves, (0,1) in 3 moves (RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT), (3,4) in 2 moves\n\nFrom (1,3), to (3,4) is RIGHT, RIGHT. That's fast!\nFrom (1,3), to (1,1) is DOWN, DOWN. That's also 2 moves.\n\nFrom (0,2), to (0,1) is 1 move. To (1,1) is 2 moves (RIGHT, DOWN or DOWN, RIGHT). To (3,4) is longer.\n\nSo RIGHT position (1,3) gives faster access to (3,4) and (1,1).\nDOWN position (0,2) gives fastest access to (0,1).\n\nGiven that (0,1) and (1,1) are both apples, I could get both regardless of which path I take.\n\nBut (3,4) is also an apple, and RIGHT puts me closer to it.\n\nAlso, being at (1,3) rather than (0,2) gives me more interior board space.\n\nI think I've overthought this. Let me make a decision.\n\nMy decision: RIGHT\n\nRationale: Gets me off the left wall, gives me access to more board space and multiple apple clusters equally, and positions me better for long-term survival.\n\nActually, you know what, let me check one more thing. The board is 10x10. Left wall is x=0. If I stay on x=0, I have only 3 directions of movement (can't go left). If I move to x=1, I still have 4 directions (can go left back to x=0 if it's safe). So being at x=1 gives me more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the better choice for maintaining options.\n\nAlso, thinking about the enemy: if they were to come after me, being on the edge makes me more vulnerable. Being in the interior is safer.\n\nFinal answer: RIGHT\n\nWait, I just need to triple-check the coordinates and movement:\n- Current head: (0, 3)\n- RIGHT move: (0, 3) \u2192 (1, 3)\n- (1, 3) is on the board (x=1, y=3, both 0-9)\n- Board shows row 3: \"0 . . . . . . . . .\" meaning (0,3) is head, and (1,3) is '.' (empty)\n- No snake bodies at (1,3)\n- So RIGHT is safe\n\nOkay, I'm confident.\n\nBut wait, I want to reconsider the apple strategy one more time. The apples are at:\n- (3,4)\n- (0,1)\n- (9,8) - far away\n- (1,1)\n- (8,4) - far away\n\nThe three relevant apples are (3,4), (0,1), (1,1). (0,1) and (1,1) are adjacent. (3,4) is separate.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1,3), I'm positioned to potentially get all three:\n- (1,1) in 2 moves\n- (0,1) in 3 moves  \n- (3,4) in 2 moves\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0,2), I'm positioned to get:\n- (0,1) in 1 move\n- (1,1) in 2 moves\n- (3,4) in 4 moves\n\nSo RIGHT gives me better access to (3,4) which might be important. Also, (3,4) is somewhat near the enemy's starting area (they're at x=4,y=8), so maybe I should get it before they do.\n\nBut actually, the enemy is far away and can't get to (3,4) quickly either.\n\nLet me think about turn 3/150. I have lots of time. The key is to not die and to build a long snake.\n\nGetting off the edge is important for survival. RIGHT does that.\n\nAlso, if I think about future moves: from (1,3), I have good options. From (0,2), I have good options too, but I'm still on the edge.\n\nI'm going with RIGHT.\n\nActually, you know what, let me be honest. I've been going in circles. Let me just pick.\n\nThe question is: from (0,3), should I go RIGHT to (1,3) or DOWN to (0,2)?\n\nReasons for RIGHT:\n- Gets off the wall\n- Better long-term board control\n- More maneuvering space\n- Closer to (3,4) apple\n\nReasons for DOWN:\n- Faster access to (0,1) apple\n- Still safe\n- Leads to (1,1) apple quickly too\n\nI think the board control argument wins. I'll go RIGHT.\n\nWait, but actually. Looking at this pragmatically. If I go DOWN, I can get an apple in 2 turns (this move + next move). If I go RIGHT, I can get an apple in 3 turns (this move + 2 more). Getting apples faster is generally better, especially since the enemy has the same score.\n\nBut the apples at (0,1) and (1,1) aren't going anywhere. The enemy can't get them quickly. So maybe speed isn't the most important factor.\n\nOkay, I'm second-guessing myself too much. Let me make a final call.\n\nI'm going DOWN. Why? Because it's a more direct path to apples, and apples are what win games. Even though RIGHT gives better board control, DOWN gives me immediate apple progress. And I can always move RIGHT after getting the apple.\n\nSo final decision: DOWN\n\nActually wait. Let me trace what happens if I go DOWN:\n- Move DOWN to (0,2)\n- I'm at (0,2), body is [(0,3), (0,4)]\n- Next turn I can go DOWN to (0,1) to eat the apple\n- Then I grow, and I'm at (0,1) with body [(0,2), (0,3), (0,4)]\n- Then I can go RIGHT to (1,1) to eat another apple\n- Then I'm at (1,1) with body [(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4)]\n- Then I can go RIGHT to (2,1), then RIGHT to (3,1), then UP to (3,2), UP to (3,3), UP to (3,4) to eat that apple\n\nThat's 5 turns total to get 3 apples (including this turn).\n\nIf I go RIGHT:\n- Move RIGHT to (1,3)\n- Next turn go DOWN to (1,2)\n- Next turn go DOWN to (1,1) to eat apple\n- Next turn go LEFT to (0,1) to eat apple\n- Next turn go RIGHT to (1,1)? No, I'm already there.\n- Then go RIGHT to (2,1), RIGHT to (3,1), UP to (3,2), UP to (3,3), UP to (3,4)\n\nThat's also about 5-6 turns for 3 apples.\n\nSo both paths are similar.\n\nBut the key difference: from (0,2) [DOWN], I can get the first apple in 1 more move.\nFrom (1,3) [RIGHT], I need 2 more moves to get an apple.\n\nSo DOWN is faster for the first apple.\n\nGiven equal long-term prospects but faster short-term gain, I'll take DOWN.\n\nAlso, the board shows that (0,1) and (1,1) are both apples. Getting to (0,2) means I'm positioned to get one of them next turn, whichever isn't taken (but the enemy can't take them quickly).\n\nOkay, I'm going with DOWN.\n\nFinal answer: DOWN\n\nWait, but I should check if any snake is going for those apples. The enemy is at (4,8). They're very far. They can't reach (0,1) or (1,1) in one or two moves. So those apples are safe.\n\nWhat about (3,4)? The enemy is at (4,8) with body (3,8). They could potentially go DOWN several times to get closer to (3,4), but it would take them 4 moves just to get to y=4. So they can't beat me to (3,4) either if I decide to go for it.\n\nSo the apples are safe for now.\n\nGiven that, the question is purely about my own positioning.\n\nLet me think about what happens if I go DOWN to (0,2):\n- My body: [(0,3), (0,4)]\n- Next turn options: DOWN to (0,1) [apple], or RIGHT to (1,2)\n- This is good\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1,3):\n- My body: [(0,3), (0,4)]\n- Next turn options: DOWN to (1,2), or RIGHT to (2,3)\n- Neither leads directly to an apple\n- But from (1,2), I can go DOWN to (1,1) [apple]\n- From (2,3), I can go RIGHT to (3,3), then UP to (3,4) [apple]\n\nSo from (1,3), I have two paths to apples, each 2 moves away.\nFrom (0,2), I have one path to an apple 1 move away, and another path 2 moves away.\n\nThe safety considerations: both moves lead to safe positions with multiple next-move options.\n\nI think the deciding factor is that (0,1) is closer from (0,2) than (1,1) is from (1,3). So DOWN gives me faster access to the nearest apple.\n\nTherefore, I choose DOWN.\n\nActually, one final consideration: What if I go RIGHT to (1,3) and then another snake appears or something? I can't predict that.\n\nWhat if I go DOWN to (0,2) and the enemy goes for (0,1)? They can't get there in time.\n\nOkay, I'm sticking with DOWN.\n\nDOWN\n\nWait, I just realized something. The board shows:\n```\n 4 T . . A . . . . A .\n```\n\nAt (0,4) there's a 'T' (tail). That's my body.\nAt (0,3) there's '0' (head).\nAt (0,2) there's '.' (empty).\nAt (0,1) there's 'A' (apple).\nAt (0,0) there's '.' (empty).\n\nSo going DOWN from (0,3) to (0,2) is indeed safe and puts me above the apple at (0,1).\n\nActually, I should verify the board coordinates. The board is shown with y from 9 (top) to 0 (bottom).\n\nRow 3: \"0 . . . . . . . . .\" - this is y=3, and at x=0 there's '0'\nRow 2: \". . . . . . . . . .\" - this is y=2, all dots\nRow 1: \"A A . . . . . . . .\" - this is y=1, at x=0 and x=1 there are 'A's\n\nSo yes, (0,3) is my head, (0,4) is my body, (0,2) is empty, (0,1) is apple.\n\nMoving DOWN to (0,2) is safe.\n\nAlright, final decision: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "First, I need to understand the current board state and my snake's position. My snake (ID 0) has its head at (0, 1) and body segments at (0, 2) and (0, 3). I've collected 2 apples so far. There are apples at (3, 4), (9, 8), (1, 1), (8, 4), and (7, 0). Enemy snake #1 has its head at (3, 7) and body at (4, 7), with 1 apple.\n\nThe board visualization shows:\n\n- Row 9: all empty except A at (9,8)\n- Row 8: all empty except A at (9,8) \u2013 wait, (9,8) is in row 8? Let's clarify: the board is shown with y-coordinate increasing upwards, so row 9 is y=9, row 8 is y=8, down to row 0 which is y=0. x-coordinate from 0 to 9 from left to right.\n\nSo, from the board state:\n\n- (0,9) to (9,9): all dots except (9,9) is empty? No, row 9: \" . . . . . . . . . .\" so all empty? But it says A at (9,8) which is row 8, x=9.\n\nLet me list the apples based on the given coordinates: (3,4), (9,8), (1,1), (8,4), (7,0).\n\nFrom the board:\n\n- Row 8: A at (9,8) \u2013 yes, that's one apple.\n- Row 4: A at (3,4), A at (8,4) \u2013 yes, two apples.\n- Row 1: A at (1,1) \u2013 yes.\n- Row 0: A at (7,0) \u2013 yes.\n\nSo apples are at (1,1), (3,4), (7,0), (8,4), (9,8).\n\nMy snake: head (0,1), body (0,2), (0,3). So from the board, row 1 has \"0 A\" at x=0 and x=1? Let's see the board:\n\nRow 1: \"0 A . . . . . . . .\" so at x=0: head (0,1), at x=1: apple (1,1), and body at (0,2) and (0,3) which are in row 2 and row 3? Row 2: \"T . . . . . . . . .\" so at x=0: T, which is tail, since body is listed head to tail, so (0,1) head, (0,2) body, (0,3) tail. But in the board, row 2 has T at x=0, which should be (0,2), and row 3 has T at x=0, which is (0,3). So yes.\n\nEnemy snake: head (3,7), body (4,7). From board, row 7: \" . . . 1 T . . . . .\" so at x=3: 1 (head), x=4: T (tail). So body is at (4,7).\n\nNow, my last move was DOWN. Since I moved down, my head was at (0,2) or something? Let's see: if I moved DOWN from where to where? The head is now at (0,1), so if I moved DOWN, that means my head was at (0,2) and I moved to (0,1)? But that would be moving down from (0,2) to (0,1), which is decreasing y, so yes, down. But in the body, I have (0,2) and (0,3), so after moving down, the head moves to (0,1), and the body shifts: the old head becomes first body segment, so from previous head at (0,2) to new body at (0,2)? No, when you move, the entire snake shifts: the head moves to new position, and each body segment takes the position of the previous one. So if head was at (0,2) and moved down to (0,1), then the body that was at (0,3) becomes at (0,2)? But I have body at (0,2) and (0,3), so let's think about the previous state.\n\nFrom the current state: head (0,1), body (0,2), (0,3). So if I moved DOWN last turn, that means before moving, head was at (0,2), and after moving down, head is at (0,1), and the old head position (0,2) becomes the new first body segment, but I already have body at (0,2), so that matches. And the previous body at (0,3) becomes the new tail, so body list should be [ (0,2), (0,3) ] but in order, so from head: (0,1), then (0,2), then (0,3) as tail. So after moving down, the body segments shift: the segment that was behind the head moves to where the head was, and so on. So if head was at (0,2), and I moved down to (0,1), then the body that was at (0,3) moves to (0,2), and the tail that was at (0,4) or something? But from the current body, it's only two segments: (0,2) and (0,3). So before moving, the snake must have been head at (0,2), body at (0,3), and tail at (0,4)? But after moving down, head to (0,1), and body becomes (0,2) and (0,3), so the previous tail at (0,4) is gone? But when you move, you don't grow unless you eat an apple. So if I didn't eat an apple, the tail should move forward, so the last segment disappears. So if before move, snake was [ (0,2), (0,3), (0,4) ]? But from current, it's [ (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) ], so if I moved down from [ (0,2), (0,3), (0,4) ], then after move, new head (0,1), and body from old head (0,2) and old body (0,3), so tail is (0,3), meaning (0,4) is gone. So yes, the snake length is 3, so it has 2 body segments and 1 head, so total 3 segments. After moving, the tail moves, so length remains same unless eating apple.\n\nBut in this case, I have apples collected 2, so I have eaten 2 apples, so snake length should be 3? Normally, snake starts with length 1, and each apple adds one segment, so after 2 apples, length should be 3, which matches: head + 2 body segments.\n\nNow, for this turn, I need to choose a move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nFirst, eliminate moves that would kill me immediately.\n\nMy head is at (0,1).\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- UP: to (0,2)\n\n- DOWN: to (0,0)\n\n- LEFT: to (-1,1) which is outside the board, since x=0 is leftmost, so LEFT is invalid, off board.\n\n- RIGHT: to (1,1)\n\nNow, check if these moves hit my own body or another snake's body.\n\nMy body is at (0,2) and (0,3). So if I move UP to (0,2), that is into my own body segment, so I would die. So UP is unsafe.\n\nMove DOWN to (0,0): is (0,0) occupied? From the board, row 0: \" . . . . . . . A . .\" so at x=0, it's empty? The board shows \" . \" for x=0, so empty. But I need to check if it hits my own body? My body is at (0,2) and (0,3), so (0,0) is not in my body. Also, enemy snake is at (3,7) and (4,7), so far away. So DOWN seems safe in terms of not hitting bodies.\n\nBut wait, when moving, I need to consider that after moving, the snake shifts, so my body will move. But for the move itself, I only care about where my head moves to. So if I move to (0,0), it should be safe as long as that cell is not occupied by any snake body at the time of move. Since all snakes move simultaneously, I need to consider where the enemy snake will move, but for immediate safety, I only need to ensure that the cell I move into is not currently occupied by any body segment, because if it is, I die.\n\nThe rule: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So at the moment of moving, if the target cell has any body part (from any snake), I die.\n\nSo for DOWN to (0,0): from current board, (0,0) is empty, as per row 0, x=0 is \" . \" so no body there. So DOWN should be safe from immediate collision.\n\nSimilarly, RIGHT to (1,1): from board, row 1, x=1 is \" A \" which is an apple, so empty of bodies? Apples are not bodies, so moving into an apple is fine, and I would eat it and grow. So (1,1) has an apple, but no body, so safe.\n\nNow, what about enemy snake? Enemy head is at (3,7), which is far away, so no immediate threat from enemy body in those cells.\n\nSo from immediate safety, both DOWN and RIGHT seem safe, while UP is into my own body, and LEFT is off board.\n\nSo I have two safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nNow, among these, I need to prefer moves that increase chance of safely eating apples and keep future options open.\n\nFirst, let's see where apples are: (1,1) is very close, at (1,1), which is adjacent to my head if I move RIGHT. So if I move RIGHT, I would eat the apple at (1,1), and grow by one segment. That seems good.\n\nIf I move DOWN, I go to (0,0), which is not near any apple directly? The apples are at (1,1), (3,4), etc., so from (0,0), I might go to (0,1) or (1,0) etc., but no apple directly at (0,0) or adjacent? (1,1) is adjacent to (0,0)? From (0,0), I can go to (0,1) or (1,0) or (-1,0) or (0,-1), but (1,0) is not an apple, and (0,1) is where I am now, but after moving down, I would be at (0,0), and my body would be at (0,1) and (0,2). So from (0,0), I can move to (1,0) or (0,1), but (0,1) would be into my own body? After moving down to (0,0), my body segments are at (0,1) and (0,2), so if I later move back to (0,1), that would be into my own body, so I die. So from (0,0), my only safe moves might be RIGHT to (1,0) or DOWN to (0,-1) which is off board, so only RIGHT to (1,0) is safe? Let's think about future moves.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake's possible moves. Since all snakes move simultaneously, I need to anticipate where the enemy might move and avoid head-on collisions or other dangers.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on my immediate options.\n\nMove RIGHT to (1,1): I eat the apple, so I grow. My new head would be (1,1), and body would be [ (0,1), (0,2) ]? After eating, I grow, so the tail doesn't move? When you eat an apple, you grow by one segment, so the tail stays, and you add a new segment. So if I move to an apple, the new body becomes: new head at (1,1), then the old head at (0,1) becomes first body, then the old body at (0,2) becomes second body, and the old tail at (0,3) remains? No, let's clarify.\n\nWhen a snake moves:\n\n- If it does not eat an apple, the head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, so the tail segment is removed (the snake moves forward).\n\n- If it eats an apple, the head moves to new position, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, but the tail segment does not move, so the snake grows by one segment. So the new body includes all old body segments plus the old head position, but since the tail doesn't move, the old tail segment stays, but actually, the body list gains one segment: the old head becomes the new first body, and all old body segments remain, so the length increases by one.\n\nIn terms of coordinate list: before move, snake is [H, B1, B2, ..., Bn] where H is head, B1 is first body, etc., Bn is tail.\n\nAfter moving without eating: new snake [H', H, B1, B2, ..., B_{n-1}] so Bn is gone? Since length same, the tail Bn is removed, so the list has n+1 segments? No, if length is L, there are L segments: head and L-1 body segments. After move without eating, length remains L, so new head H', and body segments: old head H, then old B1, ..., old B_{n-1}, so the old Bn is gone. So the new body list has L-1 segments? Let's think: before move, snake has segments: let's say L=3, so segments: S0 (head), S1 (body), S2 (tail). After moving without eating, new segments: S0' (new head), then S0, then S1? So S2 is gone? So the new body list is [S0, S1]? But that's only two body segments? No, the body list should include all segments after head. So before move, body list = [S1, S2] since head S0. After move, new head S0', body list = [S0, S1] so yes, S2 is gone, length same.\n\nIf eating an apple, after move, new head S0', body list = [S0, S1, S2] so S2 is kept, so length increases to 4.\n\nSo in my case, current snake: head (0,1), body list [(0,2), (0,3)] so segments: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) \u2014 length 3.\n\nIf I move to (1,1) which has apple, I eat it, so new head (1,1), body list becomes [(0,1), (0,2), (0,3)] so length 4. But the body list should be ordered head-to-tail, so after move, head at (1,1), then first body at (0,1), then second body at (0,2), then tail at (0,3)? But from the list, after eating, the body list is the old head and all old body segments, so [ (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) ] which is correct, so segments: (1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) \u2014 yes.\n\nIf I move down to (0,0) without eating, new head (0,0), body list becomes [(0,1), (0.2)] so segments: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) \u2014 and (0,3) is gone, so length still 3.\n\nNow, back to choosing moves.\n\nMove RIGHT to (1,1): I eat the apple, so I grow. This is good because it increases my score and length. Also, (1,1) is adjacent to other apples? Let's see apples: (1,1) is one, then (3,4), (7,0), (8,4), (9,8). From (1,1), I can go to (1,2), (1,0), (0,1), (2,1). But (0,1) would be back into my own body? After moving to (1,1), my body is at (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), so if I move back to (0,1), that would be into my body, so unsafe. But other directions might be safe.\n\nMove DOWN to (0,0): no apple, so no growth. Then I am at (0,0), with body at (0,1), (0,2). From there, I can move to (1,0) or (0,1), but (0,1) is into my body, so only (1,0) is safe? Or UP to (0,1) is into body, LEFT off board, DOWN off board, so only RIGHT to (1,0) is safe. But (1,0) might have an apple? From board, row 0: at x=1, it's \" . \" so empty, no apple. So from (0,0), only safe move is to (1,0), which is not an apple. Then from (1,0), I might go to (2,0), (1,1), etc., but (1,1) has an apple, so I could go there later. But if I move DOWN now, I miss the chance to eat (1,1) immediately, and I might be stuck in a corner.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 has head at (3,7), body at (4,7). It has 1 apple, so length 2? Head and one body, so length 2. It might move towards apples. The apples are at (3,4), (7,0), (8,4), (9,8), etc. From (3,7), it might go towards (3,4) or (9,8), etc.\n\nNow, if I move RIGHT to (1,1), I eat the apple, and I become at (1,1) with body stretching back. Is there any risk of head-on collision? Enemy is at (3,7), so unlikely to move to (1,1) immediately. But I need to consider where enemy might move.\n\nSimilarly, if I move DOWN, I go to (0,0), which is safer in terms of isolation, but I might not grow soon.\n\nNow, about keeping future options open. From (1,1), I have more directions to move: I can go to (1,2), (1,0), (0,1), (2,1). But (0,1) is my body, so only three directions. From (0,0), I have only one direction: (1,0). So from (1,1), I have more options, so it's better to move RIGHT.\n\nAlso, I might consider if moving RIGHT could lead to a trap later. For example, if I go to (1,1), and then later I might go to (2,1), etc., but I need to avoid being surrounded by my own body.\n\nAnother thing: the apple at (1,1) is the closest, so I should take it while I can, because if I don't, the enemy might not get it, but since enemy is far, probably not, but it's good to grow.\n\nMoreover, I have only 2 apples so far, and enemy has 1, so I need to grow to win. The game ends when someone reaches 50 apples or after 150 turns, so I need to collect apples efficiently.\n\nNow, let's think about long-term strategy. I am at the left edge, so I might need to move towards the center where apples are. Apples at (3,4), (7,0), (8,4), (9,8). (7,0) is on the bottom row, so from (1,1), I can go down to (1,0) then to (2,0) etc., but (7,0) is at x=7, so I need to move rightwards.\n\nFrom (0,0) if I move down, I go to (0,0), then to (1,0), then to (2,0), etc., but (1,1) apple might be taken later by someone else? But since I'm the only other snake, and it's far from enemy, probably I can get it later, but why wait? I can get it now.\n\nAlso, if I move to (1,1), I grow, so my body becomes longer, which might make it harder to maneuver in tight spaces, but from (1,1), I have space to move around.\n\nNow, considering enemy moves: enemy head at (3,7). What might it do? It might move towards apples. For example, towards (3,4) which is down, or towards (9,8) which is right and up. (3,4) is closer? From (3,7) to (3,4) is down 3 steps, to (9,8) is right 6 and up 1, so (3,4) is closer. Also, there is apple at (8,4) and (7,0), etc.\n\nBut since enemy might move, I need to avoid head-on collisions. For example, if I move to a cell that the enemy might also move to, both die. But since enemy is at (3,7), it's unlikely to move to (1,1) or (0,0) directly.\n\nSo for this turn, moving RIGHT seems better because I eat an apple immediately.\n\nNow, is there any reason to move DOWN? For example, if moving RIGHT might cause me to be trapped later? But let's see the board: from (1,1), I have access to many cells. If I move DOWN, I go to (0,0), which is a corner, and I might be limited.\n\nAlso, from (0,0), if I move RIGHT to (1,0), then I can go to (1,1) which has apple, so I can eat it later, but why delay? I can eat it now.\n\nBut if I move RIGHT now, I eat it now and grow, which is better.\n\nMoreover, if I move DOWN, I don't grow, so my snake remains shorter, which might be easier to move, but since I need apples, growing is important.\n\nAnother thing: after I move, the enemy might move in a way that threatens me, but for now, I think RIGHT is safe.\n\nLet me list all possible moves and their outcomes.\n\nMove RIGHT to (1,1):\n- Safe: yes, no body there.\n- I eat apple, so grow.\n- New position: head (1,1), body [(0,1), (0,2), (0,3)]? But after eating, body includes all old segments, so from current body, after move, body should be [ (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) ] but since I have only two body segments, after move, body list should have three segments? Current body list has two tuples: (0,2) and (0,3), so after moving without eating, body would be [ (0,1), (0,2) ], so tail (0,3) gone. But with eating, body becomes [ (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) ], so yes, tail kept. So from current snake length 3, after eating, length 4.\n\nBut in the body list, it should be ordered head to tail, so after move, head (1,1), then body (0,1), then body (0,2), then tail (0,3). But (0,1) is where the head was, so it becomes the first body segment, which is fine.\n\nNow, move DOWN to (0,0):\n- Safe: yes, empty.\n- No apple, so no growth.\n- New position: head (0,0), body [(0,1), (0,2)] so tail (0,3) gone.\n\nNow, comparing these, RIGHT gives me an apple and growth, DOWN does not.\n\nSo RIGHT is better.\n\nBut I need to ensure that after moving, I don't immediately die due to enemy move or something, but since all moves are simultaneous, I only die if I move into a body, which I'm not, or if enemy moves into my body, but that would kill enemy, not me. Or if head-on collision, but enemy is far.\n\nSo for immediate move, RIGHT seems safe and beneficial.\n\nAlso, from a strategic perspective, I should try to collect apples as quickly as possible to reach 50 first, but since 50 is high, I need to plan long-term. But for now, eating the nearby apple is good.\n\nNow, about the enemy: I need to consider where it might move. But since I don't know, I should assume it might move towards apples, but for now, it doesn't affect my immediate move.\n\nSo I think I should move RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check if there is any risk.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1,1), is there any chance that the enemy moves to (1,1)? Enemy is at (3,7), which is 6 steps away in x and 6 steps in y, so it cannot reach (1,1) in one move. So no head-on collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I move DOWN, enemy cannot reach (0,0) in one move.\n\nSo both are safe from enemy.\n\nNow, for future moves, from (1,1), I can move to (1,2), (1,0), (0,1), (2,1). But (0,1) is my body, so unsafe. So I have three directions: up, down, right. From (0,0), I have only one direction: right to (1,0). So moving RIGHT keeps more options open.\n\nTherefore, I should move RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, what about moving LEFT? Left is off board, so invalid.\n\nMoving UP is into my own body, so invalid.\n\nSo only RIGHT and DOWN are safe.\n\nAnd RIGHT is better.\n\nSo my move should be RIGHT.\n\nNow, for the rationale, I need to write a short plan for future turns. Since I'm moving to (1,1) and eating an apple, I might plan to move towards other apples, like (3,4) or (7,0). But (7,0) is on the bottom, so I might go down from (1,1) to (1,0) then right to (7,0). Or (3,4) is up and right.\n\nBut let's see the apples: (1,1) is eaten, so remaining apples: (3,4), (7,0), (8,4), (9,8). From (1,1), the closest might be (3,4) or (7,0). (3,4) is at distance sqrt(2^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(4+9)=sqrt(13)\u22483.6, while (7,0) is at distance sqrt(6^2 +1^2)=sqrt(36+1)=sqrt(37)\u22486.08, so (3,4) is closer. But I need to consider paths.\n\nAlso, enemy might go for those apples, so I need to be efficient.\n\nBut for now, I'll just plan to move towards (3,4) after eating (1,1). But from (1,1), I can go right to (2,1), then to (3,1), then up to (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). Or I might go up first to (1,2), then right, etc.\n\nBut since the board has obstacles only from snakes, I need to avoid my own body.\n\nAfter moving to (1,1), my body is from (0,1) to (0,3), so if I move right from (1,1) to (2,1), then my body shifts, and I might have space.\n\nSo for the rationale, I can say: \"Plan: After eating the apple at (1,1), move towards the apple at (3,4) while avoiding tight spaces.\"\n\nBut I need to keep it short.\n\nThe instructions say: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\n\nSo I should write a plan.\n\nBut for this move, I need to output the move first, and before that, I can write the rationale.\n\nThe response should have the rationale, then the move on the last line.\n\nSo for my response, I'll write the rationale explaining why I move RIGHT, and then the move RIGHT.\n\nBut the move must be the last word, so after the rationale, I put RIGHT.\n\nAlso, in the rationale, I should not mention future directions, but I can have a plan.\n\nThe instructions say: \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\" and \"Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.\"\n\nSo in the rationale, I can include the plan, but the final move line should be only the word.\n\nSo let's structure my response.\n\nFirst, I'll think out loud about my reasoning, which might include the plan.\n\nBut since the rationale is part of the response, I should write it clearly.\n\nFinally, the last word is RIGHT.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n\"I am moving RIGHT because it allows me to eat the apple at (1,1), increasing my score and length. This move is safe and keeps multiple options open for future moves. After eating, I plan to move towards the apple at (3,4) to continue growing while avoiding the enemy snake. \n\nRIGHT\"\n\nBut the last line should be exactly one word, so \"RIGHT\" alone.\n\nAlso, in the rationale, I should not say \"I will move RIGHT\" after the plan, but the move is stated separately.\n\nNow, to confirm, let's see if there is any other consideration.\n\nWhat about the enemy? If I move RIGHT, I might be closer to enemy if it moves down, but still far.\n\nAnother thing: the apple at (1,1) is at (1,1), and I have an apple at (7,0), which is on the bottom, but from (1,1), I can go down to (1,0) then right, but (1,0) is empty, so no issue.\n\nAlso, after I eat (1,1), my body will be from (0,1) to (0,3), so if I move down from (1,1) to (1,0), that is safe, and then I can move right.\n\nBut if I move DOWN first, I go to (0,0), then I can only go to (1,0), and then to (1,1) or (2,0), but (1,1) has apple, so I can eat it from there, but it takes two moves: first to (0,0), then to (1,0), then to (1,1). Whereas if I move RIGHT now, I eat it in one move. So better to eat now.\n\nAlso, when I eat, I grow, which might be important for avoiding death in the future because longer snake might be harder to kill, but also harder to move. But since I have space, it should be fine.\n\nSo I think RIGHT is the best move.\n\nTherefore, my decision is to move RIGHT.I am moving RIGHT to immediately eat the apple at (1,1), which increases my score and length. This move is safe as the target cell is empty and not occupied by any snake body. Moving RIGHT also keeps multiple paths open for future moves, allowing me to navigate towards other apples like (3,4) or (7,0) while avoiding tight spaces. The enemy snake is distant, so no immediate collision risk.\n\nAfter eating, I plan to move towards the apple at (3,4) by first exploring rightwards from (1,1) to (2,1) or up to (1,2), ensuring I maintain flexibility and avoid dead-ends.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples: (3,4), (9,8), (8,4), (7,0), (3,2).\nMy snake: [ (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2) ].\nCheck moves:\n- **UP (2,2)**: Currently occupied by the tail of snake #1 ( (3,6), (3,5) )? No, wait. Looking at the board: Row 2 is `T . . A . . . . . .`. (2,2) is empty. (2,2) is not in my body. It is inside the board. Safe.\n- **DOWN (2,0)**: Currently occupied by an apple (7,0)? No, looking at the board, row 0 is `. . . . . . . A . .`. Wait, the board shows `0` at (2,1). If I go DOWN to (2,0), that row shows `.`. So it's empty. Not in my body. Inside board. Safe.\n- **LEFT (1,1)**: Currently occupied by my own body (the segment after head). This is a collision. I die. **Unsafe**.\n- **RIGHT (3,1)**: Currently occupied by an apple? No, apples are at (3,2), (3,4), etc. (3,1) is empty. Not in my body. Inside board. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\nStrategy:\n- I need to eat apples.\n- Apple at (3,2) is nearby.\n  - To reach (3,2) from (2,1):\n    - Path 1: UP to (2,2), RIGHT to (3,2). (2 moves).\n    - Path 2: RIGHT to (3,1), UP to (3,2). (2 moves).\n- Apple at (3,4) is also nearby, but blocked by snake #1 currently at (3,5) or (3,6) (Wait, board shows 1 at (3,5), T at (3,6) or (3,2)? No, board shows Row 5: `. . . 1 . .`, Row 6: `. . . T . .`, Row 4: `. . . A . .`. So snake #1 is at (3,5) and (3,6).\n  - Path to (3,4): (3,4) is empty on board. I can go (3,1)->(3,2)->(3,3)->(3,4).\n  - If I go RIGHT to (3,1), I open a path to (3,2) and (3,4).\n  - If I go UP to (2,2), I open a path to (3,2).\n- What about safety?\n  - Enemy snake #1 at (3,5). If he moves DOWN, he goes to (3,4), which is the apple I want. Or he could stay.\n  - I am at (2,1).\n  - If I move UP to (2,2), I am \"above\" my tail. If I need to retreat, I have to go DOWN to (2,1), but (2,1) will be empty (since I left), so that's okay.\n  - If I move DOWN to (2,0), I am at y=0. That's a wall. If I need to move DOWN later, I die. I am also moving away from the apples (which are at y=2,4,8). Going DOWN seems inefficient for scoring, and it traps me at the bottom edge.\n  - If I move RIGHT to (3,1), I am moving towards apples. I am closer to (3,2) and (3,4).\n  - Enemy snake #1 is at (3,5). His head is at (3,5). My potential move to (3,1) is far away.\n  - However, I must check if I am moving into a trap. My current tail is at (0,2). If I move RIGHT, my tail will move from (0,2) to (0,1) (Wait, my body is (2,1)-(1,1)-(0,1)-(0,2). If I move RIGHT to (3,1), the body becomes (3,1)-(2,1)-(1,1)-(0,1). The tail (0,2) disappears.\n  - If I move UP, body becomes (2,2)-(2,1)-(1,1)-(0,1). Tail (0,2) disappears.\n  - If I move DOWN, body becomes (2,0)-(2,1)-(1,1)-(0,1). Tail (0,2) disappears.\n\nDecision: I want to head towards the apple at (3,2) or (3,4).\nMoving RIGHT (to 3,1) gets me to x=3, y=1. From there I can go UP to (3,2) (eating an apple).\nMoving UP (to 2,2) gets me to x=2, y=2. From there I can go RIGHT to (3,2) (eating an apple).\nBoth are 1 step away from the apple at (3,2).\nIs there a preference?\nIf I go RIGHT, I am on column 3. This aligns with the column of apples (3,2), (3,4).\nIf I go UP, I am on column 2.\nAlso, check (7,0). That is an apple. It is very far and currently blocked? No, it's at bottom right. I am at (2,1).\nAlso check (9,8) and (8,4). Far away.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 2: `. T . A ...` (Wait, board says `T . . A . . . . . .` for row 2). Let's re-read.\nRow 2: `T . . A . . . . . .`\nIndices:\n0: T\n1: . (Wait, my body at (0,1) is on row 1).\nAh, let's parse the ASCII board carefully.\nRow 9: ` . . . . . . . . . .`\nRow 8: ` . . . . . . . . . A`\nRow 7: ` . . . . . . . . . .`\nRow 6: ` . . . T . . . . . .` (Wait, `T` at index 3? No, `T` at index 3 is (3,6)).\nRow 5: ` . . . 1 . . . . . .` (1 at index 3).\nRow 4: ` . . . A . . . . A .` (A at 3 and 8).\nRow 3: ` . . . . . . . . . .`\nRow 2: ` T . . A . . . . . .` (T at 0? No, `T` at index 0 is (0,2). This is my tail! So `T . . A` means (0,2) is T, (1,2) is ., (2,2) is ., (3,2) is A).\nRow 1: ` T T 0 . . . . . . .` (T at 0 is (0,1)? No, wait. Head is (2,1). Body includes (1,1) and (0,1). So (0,1) is T. (1,1) is T. (2,1) is 0. So `T T 0` matches (0,1), (1,1), (2,1). Correct.\nRow 0: ` . . . . . . . A . .` (A at 7).\n\nSo:\nMy Head: (2,1).\nMy Body: (1,1), (0,1), (0,2).\nApples: (3,2) [Row 2], (3,4) [Row 4], (8,4) [Row 4], (7,0) [Row 0], (9,8) [Row 8].\nEnemy #1: Head (3,5), Body (3,6).\n\nMove Options:\n- **UP (2,2)**: Cell is empty. My tail (0,2) moves to (0,1). So (0,2) becomes free. (2,2) becomes head. Safe.\n- **DOWN (2,0)**: Cell is empty. Tail (0,2) moves. Safe.\n- **LEFT (1,1)**: Cell is my body. Unsafe.\n- **RIGHT (3,1)**: Cell is empty. Safe.\n\nIf I go **UP to (2,2)**: I am at (2,2). Next turn, I can go RIGHT to (3,2) to eat the apple. (3,2) is an apple. If I go RIGHT, I grow. My tail will not move as far. This is good.\nIf I go **RIGHT to (3,1)**: I am at (3,1). Next turn, I can go UP to (3,2) to eat the apple.\n\nWhy might I prefer UP?\nIf I go UP, I am on row 2. Row 2 has `T . . A`. So (2,2) is safe. (3,2) is the target.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am on (3,1). Row 1 has `T T 0 . .`. (3,1) is currently empty (since I'm at 2,1 and 1,1 is T, 0,1 is T). Wait, board shows Row 1: `T T 0 . .`. So (3,1) is `.`.\nSo both are open.\n\nConsider the enemy snake #1 at (3,5).\nIf he moves DOWN, he goes to (3,4).\nI want to get to (3,4) eventually. If he moves to (3,4), he might eat the apple there.\nHowever, if he moves to (3,4), that spot becomes his body. I cannot go there.\nIf I go UP to (2,2), I am in a good position to \"snipe\" (3,2) or (3,4).\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,1), I am directly below the apple column.\n\nIs there a risk of head-on collision?\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,1), could enemy #1 go DOWN (to 3,4)? No collision.\nCould he go LEFT? To (2,5). No.\nCould he go UP? To (3,6)? But his body is at (3,6)? Board says Body: [(3,6)]. If he goes UP, he hits his own body? Let's check. Head (3,5), Body (3,6). Moving UP to (3,6) is backwards into his body? No, (3,6) is \"above\" (3,5) if Y increases up. Wait, 6 > 5. So (3,6) is UP from (3,5). If he moves UP, he hits his body. So he won't go UP.\nHe might go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\nLet's check if moving RIGHT puts me in immediate danger.\nCurrent head (2,1). Moving to (3,1).\nCheck board around (3,1).\nRow 1: `T T 0 . . . . . . .`\nRow 2: `T . . A . . . . . .`\nRow 0: `. . . . . . . A . .`\nSo (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), (4,1).\n(3,1) is empty.\n(2,1) is my head (leaving).\n(1,1) is T (my body).\n(4,1) is `.` (Row 1: `...0 . .`).\nSo (3,1) is safe.\n\nIf I go UP to (2,2):\nRow 2: `T . . A . .`\n(2,2) is `.` (Row 2 index 2).\n(2,3) is `.`.\n(1,2) is `.`.\n(3,2) is `A`.\nSo (2,2) is safe.\n\nBoth seem safe. Which offers better future options?\nIf I go UP to (2,2), I can go RIGHT to (3,2) to eat the apple.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,1), I can go UP to (3,2) to eat the apple.\nIf I eat the apple at (3,2), I grow. The apple at (3,4) is close.\nIf I go UP to (2,2), I am \"outside\" the column of the apple at (3,2). If I eat (3,2), I become long. Moving from (2,2) to (3,2) to eat is a RIGHT move.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,1), I am \"below\" the apple. Moving UP to (3,2) is an UP move.\n\nLet's consider the \"opening\". My head is at (2,1). My tail is at (0,2).\nIf I go UP to (2,2), I have access to (1,2), (3,2), (2,3).\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,1), I have access to (3,2), (2,1), (4,1).\n\nHypothesis: The enemy snake #1 is at (3,5).\nIf I want to get to (3,4) or (3,8), I need to climb up column 3.\nIf I go RIGHT now, I am at (3,1). This places me directly in the column.\nIf I go UP, I am at (2,2). I am one step to the left of the column.\n\nIs there any benefit to staying left?\nThe apple at (7,0) is on the bottom right.\nThe apple at (9,8) is top right.\nThe apple at (8,4) is right.\nSo most apples are to the right.\nTherefore, moving RIGHT seems directionally correct.\n\nLet's look at the specific move RIGHT.\nIs there any immediate threat?\nEnemy #1 at (3,5).\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,1).\nWait, I just realized something. The board shows Row 2 has a `T` at index 0. That's my tail (0,2).\nRow 2 is `T . . A`.\nSo (2,2) is empty.\nIf I move UP, I go to (2,2).\nIf I move RIGHT, I go to (3,1).\n\nIs there a trap?\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at (3,1).\nIf the enemy at (3,5) moves DOWN to (3,4), he eats the apple there? Or just moves?\nIf he moves to (3,4), that spot becomes his body.\nIf I then try to go UP from (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (3,4), I might run into him.\nBut I am only at turn 7. I can deal with that later.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (7,0).\nIt's at (7,0). My head is at (2,1).\nTo get there, I need to go mostly RIGHT, a bit DOWN.\nIf I go UP, I am moving away from (7,0) (y=0).\nIf I go RIGHT, I am moving towards (7,0) (x increases).\nSo RIGHT is better for (7,0).\n\nLet's look at the apple at (3,4).\nTo get there from (2,1): (2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4)->(3,4) or (3,1)->(3,2)->(3,3)->(3,4).\nFrom (3,1): 3 moves UP.\nFrom (2,2): 2 moves UP + 1 move RIGHT.\nFrom (2,1): If RIGHT (to 3,1), then 3 moves UP.\nSo (2,2) is slightly closer? No, (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (3,4) is 4 moves.\n(2,1) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) is 4 moves.\nActually, they are equidistant (4 moves).\nBut (2,2) is adjacent to (3,2), which is an apple.\n(3,1) is adjacent to (3,2).\nSo both are good for the first apple.\n\nHowever, there is an apple at (7,0).\n(7,0) is 5 X moves away. If I am at (2,1), I need to move RIGHT 5 times and DOWN 1 time.\nIf I move UP to (2,2), I have to move DOWN later to get to y=0.\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,1), I am already staying at y=1 (getting closer to y=0).\n\nAlso, look at the enemy snake. He is at (3,5). His body is (3,6).\nIf he wants to go DOWN, he can go to (3,4). If he goes there, he eats the apple (if it's still there).\nWait, the apple is at (3,4). If he goes to (3,4), he eats it and grows.\nIf I want that apple, I need to beat him to it.\nI am at (2,1). He is at (3,5).\nDistance for me to (3,4):\nPath 1: (2,1)->(3,1)->(3,2)->(3,3)->(3,4) = 4 turns.\nPath 2: (2,1)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4)->(3,4) = 4 turns.\nDistance for him to (3,4): 1 turn.\nSo he can eat the (3,4) apple instantly if he wants.\nSo I should not count on getting (3,4) unless he chooses not to go there.\nHe might go for (8,4) or (9,8)?\n(8,4) is far. (9,8) is far.\n(3,4) is right next to him.\nSo it's highly likely he will eat (3,4) next turn.\nIf he eats (3,4), he grows. The cell (3,4) becomes his body.\nI should not plan to go through (3,4).\n\nWhat other apples are there?\n(3,2) is an apple. He is at (3,5). Distance for him to (3,2) is 3 turns (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN). I can get there in 2 turns (UP, UP) or 3 turns (RIGHT, UP, UP).\nSo I can probably get (3,2) before him.\n(7,0) is far.\n(9,8) is far.\n(8,4) is far.\n(3,2) is the closest apple for me.\n(3,2) is also reachable.\n\nSo, the plan is to get (3,2).\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,1), next turn I can go UP to (3,2) and eat it.\nIf I go UP to (2,2), next turn I can go RIGHT to (3,2) and eat it.\n\nWhich starting move is safer?\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,1):\nI am at (3,1).\nNext turn, if I want to eat (3,2), I go UP.\nMy tail will be at (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) ??? No, wait.\nCurrent: [ (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2) ]\nAfter RIGHT: [ (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1) ] (Tail (0,2) gone).\nIf I then go UP to (3,2) (eating apple), I grow. My body becomes: [ (3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1) ].\nI am safely on row 2.\n\nIf I go UP to (2,2):\nCurrent: [ (2,1), (1,1), (0,1), (0,2) ]\nAfter UP: [ (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1) ] (Tail (0,2) gone).\nIf I then go RIGHT to (3,2) (eating apple), I grow. My body becomes: [ (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1) ].\nI am safely on row 2.\n\nBoth paths seem viable.\nIs there any immediate danger?\nIf I go UP to (2,2), my head is at (2,2).\nIf the enemy at (3,5) moves LEFT (to 2,5), no collision.\nIf he moves DOWN (to 3,4), no collision.\nIf he moves RIGHT (to 4,5), no collision.\nIf he moves UP (to 3,6), he dies (hits his body).\nSo he will likely move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\nNone of these hit me if I am at (2,2) or (3,1).\n\nIs there any reason to prefer one over the other?\nIf I go RIGHT, I am on the \"critical path\" to the right side of the board.\nIf I go UP, I am slightly out of the way.\nAlso, if I go RIGHT, I am at x=3.\nIf I need to retreat later (because I grow and block myself), having x=3 might be better than x=2?\nActually, if I am at (3,1) and I grow, I have a long tail.\nIf I am at (2,2) and I grow, I have a long tail.\nIt seems symmetrical.\n\nHowever, look at the board again.\nRow 1: `T T 0 . .`\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,1), I become the `.` at index 3 on row 1.\nRow 2: `T . . A`\nIf I move UP to (2,2), I become the `.` at index 2 on row 2.\nWait, looking at the ASCII board provided:\nRow 1: ` T T 0 . . . . . . .`\nRow 2: ` T . . A . . . . . .`\nSo (1,2) is `.`. (2,2) is `.`.\nIf I move UP to (2,2), I am on row 2.\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,1), I am on row 1.\n\nIs there any reason to be on row 2 vs row 1?\nThe apple at (3,2) is on row 2.\nIf I am at (2,2) (row 2), I am on the same row as the apple. I need to move RIGHT to get it.\nIf I am at (3,1) (row 1), I am one row below the apple. I need to move UP to get it.\nIf I am at (3,1) and I move UP to (3,2), I eat the apple.\nIf I am at (2,2) and I move RIGHT to (3,2), I eat the apple.\nIn both cases, I end up at (3,2).\n\nConsider the \"gap\". My current body is at (2,1), (1,1), (0,1).\nIf I move UP to (2,2), I leave (2,1) empty.\nMy body follows: (2,1), (1,1), (0,1).\nIf I later need to turn around, I can go DOWN to (2,1).\nHowever, (2,1) will be occupied by my body (the segment behind head).\nWait, if I move UP, my body is [ (2,2), (2,1), (1,1), (0,1) ].\nIf I then move DOWN, I go to (2,1). That is where my body currently is. That is a collision.\nSo I cannot go immediately back DOWN.\nBut after a few moves (e.g., eat apple, grow), I might be able to loop back.\nThis is true for both UP and RIGHT.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (7,0).\n(7,0) is at y=0.\nI am at y=1.\nIf I stay at y=1 (Move RIGHT), I am closer to y=0.\nIf I go to y=2 (Move UP), I am further from y=0.\nSo RIGHT is better for (7,0).\n\nLet's look at the apple at (3,2).\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at (3,1). Distance 1.\nIf I go UP, I am at (2,2). Distance 1.\nEqual.\n\nWhat about the apple at (8,4) or (9,8)?\nThese are far right.\nI need to move right.\nRIGHT move moves me right.\nUP move moves me up (neutral for right, bad for bottom right).\n\nSo, moving RIGHT seems better for the long term apples ((7,0), (8,4), (9,8)).\nMoving UP is better for (3,4)? No, (3,4) is likely taken by snake #1.\nIf snake #1 takes (3,4), I cannot go there.\nSo I should ignore (3,4).\nThe remaining apples are (3,2), (7,0), (8,4), (9,8).\n(3,2) is close. (7,0) is mid-range. (8,4), (9,8) are far.\nTo get to (7,0), (8,4), (9,8), I need to move RIGHT.\nTherefore, moving RIGHT now is the correct directional move.\n\nDouble check safety of RIGHT.\nTarget: (3,1).\nIs (3,1) in my body?\nMy body: (1,1), (0,1), (0,2). No.\nIs it in enemy body?\nEnemy #1: (3,5), (3,6). No.\nIs it on the board? Yes (x=3, y=1).\nIs it backwards into myself? I am at (2,1). Backwards would be (1,1). (3,1) is forward. Safe.\n\nIs there a risk of the enemy moving into me?\nEnemy at (3,5).\nIf he moves DOWN, he goes to (3,4).\nIf he moves LEFT, he goes to (2,5).\nIf he moves RIGHT, he goes to (4,5).\nNone of these are (3,1).\nSo no immediate collision.\n\nSo, RIGHT is safe. RIGHT is directionally optimal for future apples. RIGHT sets me up to eat (3,2) or (7,0) next.\n\nWait, if I go RIGHT to (3,1), and I want to eat (7,0), I can go (3,1)->(4,1)->(5,1)->(6,1)->(6,0)->(7,0).\nThis is clear.\nIf I go UP to (2,2), to get to (7,0) I have to go DOWN to (2,1) then RIGHT...\n(2,2)->(2,1)->(3,1)->...\nWait, (2,1) will be my body if I went UP? No, if I go UP to (2,2), my body becomes (2,1), (1,1), (0,1).\nSo (2,1) is occupied by my body. I cannot go back DOWN to (2,1).\nIf I go UP to (2,2), I am \"stuck\" going forward (Left, Right, Up). I cannot go DOWN.\nThis limits my path to (7,0) significantly. I would have to go LEFT or RIGHT or UP. To get to (7,0) which is to the right and down, I cannot go down immediately. I would have to go RIGHT, then maybe loop around later. But that's difficult.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,1), my body becomes (2,1), (1,1), (0,1).\nSo (2,1) is occupied. I cannot go LEFT to (2,1).\nBut I can go DOWN to (3,0) (since y=0 is the wall, so I can't go DOWN further, but I can stay on y=1 and move right).\nSo if I am at (3,1), I can go (4,1), (5,1)... (7,1), (7,0).\nIf I am at (2,2), I can go (3,2), (4,2)... but then to get to y=0, I need to go DOWN. But to go DOWN, I need a path.\nIf I am at (3,2), I can go (3,1)? No, (3,1) might be occupied by my body if I came from there.\nIf I came from (2,2) to (3,2), my body is (2,2), (2,1)... So (3,1) is empty.\nSo I could go (3,2)->(3,1)->(3,0)->(4,0)->...\nSo both are possible.\n\nBut the \"safe retreat\" logic:\nIf I go UP to (2,2), I cannot go DOWN. If I get trapped, I can't retreat down.\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,1), I cannot go LEFT. If I get trapped, I can't retreat left.\nHowever, the board boundaries are at (0,0) and (9,9).\nGoing LEFT into x=0 is dangerous (dead end).\nGoing UP into y=9 is generally safer than going DOWN into y=0? Or vice versa?\nActually, corners are bad.\n(0,0) is a corner.\n(9,9) is a corner.\n(0,9) is a corner.\n(9,0) is a corner.\nIf I am at (2,1), going UP to (2,2) moves me away from (0,0).\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,1), I stay near y=1.\nThere is an apple at (7,0). That is near (9,0).\nSo eventually I might go to the bottom right corner.\nIf I go RIGHT now, I am on the path to the bottom right.\nIf I go UP, I am on the path to the top.\n\nLet's prioritize the apples.\nApples: (3,2), (7,0), (9,8), (8,4), (3,2).\n(3,2) is closest.\n(7,0) is second closest.\n(8,4), (9,8) are far.\n(3,4) is dangerous (enemy).\nSo I want to be able to pivot between (3,2) and (7,0).\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,1):\n- (3,2) is UP. (7,0) is RIGHT then DOWN.\nThis seems flexible.\nIf I go UP to (2,2):\n- (3,2) is RIGHT. (7,0) is ... tricky. I am at y=2. To get to y=0, I must go DOWN. To go DOWN, I need a clear path.\n  If I go (2,2)->(3,2), body is (2,2)->(2,1)->...\n  Next turn, if I go (3,3) or (4,2), I can eventually loop down.\n  But if I go (2,2) and then (3,2), I am blocked from going DOWN to (3,1) if my body is in the way? No, (3,1) would be empty.\n  Actually, if I go UP then RIGHT: [ (3,2), (2,2), (2,1), (1,1) ]. (3,1) is empty. I could go (3,2)->(3,1)->(3,0) -> ... to (7,0).\n  So it's also possible.\n\nHowever, moving RIGHT (to 3,1) keeps me at y=1, which is the y-coordinate of the apple at (7,0).\nSo reducing the Y-distance to 0 is good.\n\nAlso, looking at the board state, there is a `T` at (0,2) and `T` at (0,1). This is my tail near the left wall.\nIf I go UP, I am adding verticality.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am moving away from the wall.\n\nLet's consider the enemy snake again.\nSnake #1 at (3,5).\nIf I go RIGHT to (3,1), I am in column 3.\nSnake #1 is in column 3.\nIf he goes DOWN, he goes to (3,4).\nIf I go UP, I go to (3,2).\nIf he goes DOWN to (3,4), and I go UP to (3,2), we are separated by (3,3).\nIf he goes DOWN to (3,4) and eats the apple, he grows. His tail (3,6) moves to (3,5).\nIf he eats, his body becomes (3,4), (3,5), (3,6).\nIf I am at (3,2), I am safe.\nIf I am at (3,1), I am safe.\nIf he moves DOWN, he occupies (3,4) and (3,5). (3,3) is empty.\nSo I can go to (3,3) if I want.\nBut (3,2) is the apple I want.\nSo if I go RIGHT to (3,1), I can go UP to (3,2) and eat. I will be at (3,2).\nThen I am next to his body at (3,3) or (3,4)? No, he is at (3,4), (3,5). So I am at (3,2). Safe.\n\nIs there any scenario where RIGHT is worse than UP?\nIf I go UP, I can go RIGHT to (3,2).\nIf I go RIGHT, I can go UP to (3,2).\nSymmetric for the apple.\nBut for the apple at (7,0):\nRIGHT gets me closer.\nUP moves me away.\nSo RIGHT is better.\n\nAlso, look at the apple at (8,4).\nIf I go RIGHT, I am on x=3.\nIf I go UP, I am on x=2.\nBoth are far from x=8.\nBut moving RIGHT is a step towards x=8.\n\nLet's check one final thing. Is (3,1) safe from the enemy moving into it?\nEnemy at (3,5). Distance to (3,1) is 4 units. He can't reach it in 1 turn.\nSo safe.\n\nDecision: RIGHT.\n\nLong term plan:\nMove RIGHT to (3,1). Then move UP to (3,2) to eat the apple. From there, evaluate moving towards (7,0) or (8,4), while avoiding snake #1 who is likely at (3,4). Keep an eye on the bottom right corner.\n\nMove:\nRIGHTRIGHT",

Moving UP to (3, 2) allows me to eat this apple immediately, grow, and position myself to access the apples at (8, 4), (9, 8), and (7, 0).\n\nChecking safety:\n- **UP to (3, 2)**: This cell contains an apple. My body is currently at (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2). After eating the apple, my body will extend to (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2). There are no collisions.\n- **RIGHT to (4, 1)**: This is safe but moves me away from the apple at (3, 2).\n- **LEFT to (2, 1)**: This is my own body (the segment behind the head), so it would kill me.\n- **DOWN to (3, 0)**: This is safe (empty), but moving away from the apple at (3, 2) is inefficient. Additionally, moving DOWN brings me closer to the bottom wall and the apple at (7, 0), which I can reach later.

However, looking at the map, Snake #1 is at (4, 4). To collide with me at (3, 2), Snake #1 would have to move Left to (3, 4) and then Left to (2, 4) this turn (impossible, moves 2 cells) or jump to me. The only way Snake #1 can cause a head-on collision this turn is if it moves Left to (3, 4) (impossible collision) or if it moves to (3, 2) (requires moving Left 1 and Down 2, also impossible). Wait, let's check the collision rules carefully. \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn\". Snake #1 is at (4, 4). The distance to (3, 2) is 2 units (1 left, 2 down). Snake #1 moves 1 unit per turn. Therefore, Snake #1 cannot reach (3, 2) this turn.

Checking the board: Row 4 has 'A' at (0, 4), 'T' at (3, 4), 'T' at (4, 4), and '1' at (5, 4). The character at (3, 4) is 'T'. Since my body segments are at (3, 2), (3, 1), etc., and my tail is at (1, 1), this 'T' is not me. It is an obstacle. Moving UP into (3, 4) would be moving into a body part (likely an old segment of mine or a hazard). Therefore, **UP is unsafe**.\n- **DOWN**: Moves to (3, 2). The board shows this is 'T' (part of my body). This is my own body. **DOWN is unsafe**.\n- **LEFT**: Moves to (2, 3). The board shows this is empty ('.'). **LEFT is safe**.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to (4, 3). The board shows this is empty ('.'). **RIGHT is safe**.\n\nI must choose between LEFT and RIGHT.\n\n**Long-term Plan/Strategy:**\nI am currently at (3, 3). I need to clear the obstacles around me. There is an apple at (7, 0) to the South-East. There is an apple at (8, 4) and (9, 8) to the North-East. The immediate area around (3, 3) is safe in the LEFT and RIGHT directions. However, looking at the board, there is a cluster of apples at (7, 0), (8, 4), and (9, 8). I should position myself to eventually reach these. Moving RIGHT towards x=4 opens up the path towards the apple at (8, 4) and (9, 8). Moving LEFT towards x=2 or x=1 moves me away from these apples and deeper into a potential dead-end (since there are walls/bodies at x=0,1 at y=1,2, etc.). Actually, looking closer at the board, the area to the LEFT (x=0, y=1) is filled with my tail 'T's. Moving LEFT seems to be going into a narrower part of the board. Moving RIGHT opens up the board.\n\n**Turn 10 Decision:**\nMy previous logic was flawed regarding the board coordinates. I am at (3, 3). The cell immediately above (3, 4) is occupied (by a 'T'). The cell immediately below (3, 2) is occupied (by a 'T'). I must move horizontally.\n- **LEFT (2, 3)**: Safe.\n- **RIGHT (4, 3)**: Safe.\n\nComparing the two:\n- Moving RIGHT brings me closer to the apple at (7, 0) and the cluster at (8, 4), (9, 8).\n- Moving LEFT takes me away from those apples and towards the area where my tail is densely packed.\n\nI will move **RIGHT**.\n\nRIGHT",

Increases x-distance from Enemy #1 (who is at x=6). By moving RIGHT to x=5, I stay at y=3. If Enemy #1 continues RIGHT (likely, since they just moved Right), they will move to (7, 4). I remain safely separated by a \"knight's move\" distance.\n    -   **Cons:** Slightly further from the (7, 0) apple.\n\n**Decision:**\nEnemy #1 just moved RIGHT and has a clear path to continue RIGHT. If they continue, they will leave the area. If I move RIGHT, I maintain my advance toward the Northeast apples (8,4 and 9,8). Moving DOWN brings me closer to the enemy and forces a potential confrontation over the (7,0) apple. Since the enemy is moving away (likely), moving RIGHT is safer to maintain distance and pursue the higher density of apples (2 apples NE vs 1 apple SE). Also, moving RIGHT avoids turning back towards the \"T\" at (0,4), keeping forward momentum.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAdvance towards (8, 4) and (9, 8) apples. Avoid interception by Enemy #1, who appears to be moving East. Monitor the (7, 0) apple for a later approach if the Northeast path closes.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Body: [(3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (2,1)].  \nEnemy possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (4,4): my body at (4,4) \u2192 enemy would die if they move there.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,2): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,3): enemy\u2019s own body \u2192 death for them.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,3): empty.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT.  \n\nHead-on collision check (my next head vs enemy\u2019s next head):  \n- My UP (6,5) vs enemy DOWN (4,2) / RIGHT (5,3) \u2192 no match.  \n- My DOWN (6,3) vs enemy DOWN (4,2) / RIGHT (5,3) \u2192 no match.  \n- My RIGHT (7,4) vs enemy DOWN (4,2) / RIGHT (5,3) \u2192 no match.  \n\nNo immediate head-on risk.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting & future options**  \nApples: (9,8), (8,4), (7,0), (3,9), (0,4).  \n\nClosest Manhattan:  \n- (8,4) is 2 steps right from me.  \n- (0,4) is 6 steps left, but left is blocked now anyway.  \n- (7,0) is 7 steps down.  \n- (3,9) is far.  \n- (9,8) is far.  \n\nGoing RIGHT toward (8,4): next head at (7,4), body: [(6,4),(5,4),(4,4)].  \nFrom (7,4): UP (7,5), DOWN (7,3), RIGHT (8,4) \u2014 LEFT blocked by my body at (6,4).  \nThat gives 3 options next turn, and RIGHT (8,4) is the apple.  \n\nGoing UP to (6,5): next head at (6,5), body: [(6,4),(5,4),(4,4)].  \nFrom (6,5): UP (6,6), DOWN blocked (body at (6,4)), LEFT (5,5), RIGHT (7,5). That\u2019s 3 options but moves away from closest apple.  \n\nGoing DOWN to (6,3): next head at (6,3), body: [(6,4),(5,4),(4,4)].  \nFrom (6,3): UP blocked (body at (6,4)), DOWN (6,2), LEFT (5,3), RIGHT (7,3). Also 3 options, but farther from apple (8,4) and closer to enemy area.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long-term plan note**  \nEnemy is longer (length 5 vs my 3). Avoid confrontation. Apple (8,4) is reachable in 2 moves if I go RIGHT now. Next turn I can take apple if still there and safe. Keep checking enemy\u2019s possible moves each turn \u2014 they may move DOWN or RIGHT, moving away from me currently.\n\n---\n\n**Best choice:** RIGHT \u2014 moves toward closest apple, keeps future options open, avoids enemy.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "**Current State Analysis (Turn 12/150):**\n- **My Position:** Head at (5, 3). Body: [(4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1)].\n- **Enemy #1:** Head at (7, 4). Body: [(6, 4), (5, 4)].\n- **My Last Move:** I moved RIGHT to (5, 3). This placed me directly above my own tail at (5, 2)? No, my tail is at (3, 1). Let's look at the board. My head is at (5, 3). My body goes left to (4, 3), then left to (3, 3), etc.\n- **Enemy's Last Move:** Enemy moved RIGHT to (7, 4).\n- **Apple Status:** (8, 4) is an apple.\n\n**Safety Check (Potential Moves from 5,3):**\n1.  **UP (5, 4):**\n    -   **Collision Risk:** The board (last turn) showed 'T' at (5, 4). This is Enemy #1's tail. Since we move simultaneously, the tail *usually* moves away, making this safe. However, looking at Enemy #1's body: Head (7,4) -> (6,4) -> (5,4). If Enemy #1 moves to (8,4) (likely, since there's an apple), their tail will leave (5,4).\n    -   **Specific Threat:** The apple at (8, 4) is very tempting. If Enemy #1 moves RIGHT to (8, 4), I would be moving into a collision if I also moved RIGHT. But I am considering UP.\n    -   **Alternative Threat:** Enemy #1 is at (7, 4). If they move DOWN to (7, 3), they are one step away. If I move UP to (5, 4), I am safe from collision this turn.\n    -   **Wait:** Let's look at the board again.\n        Row 4: `A . . . . T T 1 A .`\n        This represents (0,4) to (9,4).\n        (4,4) is 'T' (Enemy tail).\n        (5,4) is 'T' (Enemy tail).\n        (6,4) is 'T' (Enemy tail? No, body). Wait, the board representation might be ambiguous about body vs tail if they are adjacent. The description says Enemy Body is [(6,4), (5,4)]. So (6,4) is body, (5,4) is body/tail.\n        If I move UP to (5,4), I am entering the cell currently occupied by Enemy's body. Since they move simultaneously, if they move their head and body shifts, (5,4) becomes empty. This is generally safe *unless* the enemy head moves into the spot I am leaving or another collision occurs.\n        However, looking at my body: My head is (5,3). My next segment is (4,3). So (5,3) is safe to leave.\n        (5,4) is occupied by Enemy. It will likely be empty next turn.\n2.  **DOWN (5, 2):**\n    -   **Collision Risk:** The board shows '.' at (5, 2).\n    -   **My Body:** My body continues to (3,2), (3,1). (5,2) is empty.\n    -   **Result:** **SAFE**.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 3):**\n    -   **Collision Risk:** This is my previous head position. It is currently occupied by my body segment. Moving here is hitting myself.\n    -   **Result:** **DEADLY**.\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 3):**\n    -   **Collision Risk:** The board shows '.' at (6, 3).\n    -   **Result:** **SAFE**.\n\n**Strategic Evaluation (UP, DOWN, RIGHT):**\n-   **Option UP (to 5, 4):**\n    -   Enemy #1 is at (7, 4). If they move DOWN to (7, 3), we are 2 cells apart horizontally.\n    -   If they move RIGHT to (8, 4), we are far apart.\n    -   The main issue with UP is that it moves me closer to Enemy #1's horizontal line.\n    -   It doesn't grab an apple immediately.\n-   **Option DOWN (to 5, 2):**\n    -   Moves me away from Enemy #1 (who is at y=4).\n    -   Moves me toward the apple at (7, 0).\n    -   My body is currently (4,3), (3,3), (3,2)... If I go DOWN to (5,2), I might eventually trap myself if I don't eat apples soon, but the path is open.\n    -   **Downside:** It's further from the apple at (8, 4), which Enemy #1 is likely to grab.\n-   **Option RIGHT (to 6, 3):**\n    -   **Immediate Gain:** Puts me at x=6. Next turn I could reach (8, 4) if I go UP (7,3) -> (8,4)? No, (6,3) -> (7,3) -> (8,4).\n    -   **Enemy Interaction:** Enemy #1 is at (7, 4). If I go RIGHT to (6, 3), and Enemy goes DOWN to (7, 3), we would collide? No, Enemy at (7,4) down to (7,3). Me at (6,3). We are adjacent diagonally (we are (6,3), enemy (7,3)). That is NOT a collision (heads don't overlap).\n    -   **Blocking:** If I move RIGHT to (6, 3), and Enemy moves RIGHT to (8, 4), I am in a good position to pursue or cut them off.\n    -   **Risk:** If Enemy #1 moves DOWN to (7, 3), and I move RIGHT to (6, 3), we are neighbors. If I then move RIGHT again next turn to (7, 3), and they are still there, I die. But if they move down, I can keep moving right.\n    -   **Comparison to DOWN:**\n        -   UP: (5, 4) - risky if enemy moves down/left.\n        -   DOWN: (5, 2) - safer from enemy (distance), leads to (7,0).\n        -   RIGHT: (6, 3) - Aggressive. Chases the (8, 4) apple. Closes distance to enemy.\n\n**Decision:**\nEnemy #1 is at (7, 4). They are likely to go for the apple at (8, 4) or (9, 8). If they go RIGHT to (8, 4), they will be at x=8, y=4.\nI am at (5, 3).\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 3), I am moving towards the center of the board and the NE apples.\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 2), I am moving away from the enemy and towards the SE apple (7, 0).\nThe apple at (7, 0) is isolated. The apples at (8, 4) and (9, 8) are a pair.\nIf I go DOWN, I guarantee I don't collide with Enemy #1 this turn (unless they throw the game by diving down 2 spaces, which is unlikely).\nIf I go RIGHT, I maintain access to the NE cluster.\nGiven the turn count (12/150), fighting for the NE cluster (2 apples) is better than chasing the SE apple (1 apple), *unless* the NE cluster is too dangerous.\nEnemy #1 just moved RIGHT. If they continue moving RIGHT, they will be at (8, 4) or (9, 4).\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 3), I am 2 cells away from their potential position.\nLet's re-evaluate the immediate collision for RIGHT.\nEnemy Head (7,4). My Head (5,3).\nIf I move RIGHT -> (6, 3).\nIf Enemy moves DOWN -> (7, 3). Result: I am (6,3), Enemy (7,3). No collision.\nIf Enemy moves RIGHT -> (8, 4). Result: I am (6,3), Enemy (8,4). No collision.\nIf Enemy moves UP -> (7, 5). Result: Safe.\nIf Enemy moves LEFT -> (6, 4). Result: I am (6,3), Enemy (6,4). No collision.\nSo RIGHT is safe from immediate head-on collision.\n\nHowever, the DOWN move to (5, 2) is also safe.\nWhy prefer RIGHT?\nThe apples at (8, 4) and (9, 8) are high value. Enemy #1 is heading that way. By moving RIGHT, I signal intent to compete. By moving DOWN, I concede the NE apples to Enemy #1.\nCan I beat Enemy #1 to (8, 4)?\nDistance for Enemy to (8, 4): 1 cell (RIGHT).\nDistance for Me to (8, 4): ~3 cells.\nEnemy will get (8, 4) first.\nSo fighting for (8, 4) is bad.\nWhat about (9, 8)? Enemy is at (7,4). Distance ~6. I am at (5,3). Distance ~9.\nEnemy is closer.\nIf I go DOWN, I go for (7, 0). Distance 3.\nEnemy is unlikely to come down for (7, 0) given they are chasing NE.\nSo DOWN seems strategically better (securing an apple) than RIGHT (fighting a lost cause for (8,4)).\nWait, if Enemy eats (8, 4), they grow. If I go DOWN, I get (7, 0) and grow.\nLet's look at the board again.\nEnemy body: (7,4) -> (6,4) -> (5,4).\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 3), I am right next to (6, 4). If Enemy moves LEFT (backwards) they die. If Enemy moves UP or DOWN, they leave (6, 4).\nBut what if I go DOWN?\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 2), I am far away.\nThe only danger with DOWN is my own tail. My tail is at (3, 1). My body is (4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1).\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 2), I am clear of my body.\nLet's check LEFT again. (4,3). That is the cell I just left. That is death.\nLet's check UP. (5, 4). Enemy body is there. It will move. It is safe.\nBut UP moves me toward the enemy.\nDOWN moves me away.\nThe apple at (7, 0) is safe. The apple at (8, 4) is contested.\nI should take the safe apple.\n**Wait**, let's check if (5, 2) is empty. Board shows (5, 2) is '.'.\nSo DOWN is (5, 2).\nIs there any other option?\nRIGHT (6, 3). Board shows '.'.\nUP (5, 4). Board shows 'T' (Enemy body).\nGiven the choice between a safe move away from the enemy (DOWN) and a move toward the enemy (RIGHT/UP), DOWN is safer.\nAlso, DOWN leads to (7, 0).\nSo, DOWN is the logical choice.\nWhy did I consider RIGHT in the previous turn? \"Advance towards (8, 4) and (9, 8) apples.\" But that was before I saw Enemy #1 move to (7, 4). Now they are right next to (8, 4). I cannot win that race.\nTherefore, I will pivot to the SE apple.\n\nOne final check:\nEnemy at (7, 4).\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 2).\nIf Enemy goes DOWN to (7, 3).\nWe are (5, 2) and (7, 3). Safe.\nIf Enemy goes LEFT to (6, 4).\nSafe.\nIf Enemy goes UP to (7, 5).\nSafe.\nSo DOWN is safe.\nRIGHT (6, 3) is also safe, but puts me in a contested area for no immediate gain.\nDOWN is the best move.\n\nWait, let's check (5, 4) (UP) again.\nIf I go UP, I enter (5, 4). Enemy body is there.\nIf Enemy moves RIGHT, their body shifts. (5, 4) becomes empty.\nIf Enemy moves DOWN, they leave (5, 4) alone.\nSo UP is safe-ish.\nBut UP puts me at y=4. I am now on the same row as the enemy.\nI want to be safe. DOWN puts me at y=2.\nDistance to (7, 0) from (5, 2): 2 Right, 2 Down.\nDistance to (7, 0) from (5, 3): 2 Right, 3 Down.\nDOWN is closer.\nDOWN is safer (further from enemy).\nDOWN is a direct path to an objective.\nDOWN is the move.\n\nWait, is there an apple at (8, 4)? Yes.\nIs there an apple at (7, 0)? Yes.\nIs (7, 0) safer? Yes.\nI will go DOWN.\n\nOne tiny detail: My body is [(4,3), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1)].\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 2), I am safe.\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 2), I will be moving into a space that is currently empty.\nI will move DOWN.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN towards the apple at (7, 0). Avoid the conflict in the North-East. Once (7, 0) is eaten, reassess.\n\nDOWN",

Body: [(7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4)].\n- **Enemy's Last Move:** Enemy moved RIGHT to (8, 4). They ate the apple at (8, 4).\n- **Apple Status:** (8, 4) is gone. Remaining apples: (9, 8), (7, 0), (3, 9), (0, 4), (9, 6).\n\n**Safety Check (Potential Moves from 5, 2):**\n1.  **UP (5, 3):**\n    -   This is currently my body (the segment immediately behind my head). Moving here is moving backwards into myself. **DEADLY.**\n2.  **DOWN (5, 1):**\n    -   Board shows '.'.\n    -   No body parts.\n    -   **SAFE.**\n3.  **LEFT (4, 2):**\n    -   Board shows 'T' (my own tail).\n    -   Since the tail moves away simultaneously, this is usually safe.\n    -   However, looking at the board: Row 2 has `T` at (3, 2). My tail is at (3, 2). The cell (4, 2) is empty.\n    -   **SAFE.**\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 2):**\n    -   Board shows '.'.\n    -   **SAFE.**\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n- **Objective:** The nearest apple is at (7, 0). The distance from (5, 2) is 2 Right, 2 Down.\n- **Path 1 (LEFT):** Moving LEFT towards (0, 4) and (3, 9). This goes West.\n- **Path 2 (DOWN):** Moving DOWN towards (7, 0). This is the best route to the nearest apple.\n- **Path 3 (RIGHT):** Moving RIGHT towards the remaining NE apples (9, 8), (9, 6). This requires passing near Enemy #1, who is currently at (8, 4) (having just eaten) and will likely head towards (9, 8) or (9, 6).\n\n**Comparison of DOWN vs RIGHT:**\n- **RIGHT (6, 2):** Puts me closer to the enemy's territory. Enemy #1 just grew at (8, 4). They will likely move UP towards (9, 8) or (9, 6). While (6, 2) is safe, moving into that cluster is risky given the enemy's new position and size.\n- **DOWN (5, 1):** Moves me directly towards the apple at (7, 0). This is a low-traffic area. Enemy #1 is far away (y=4) and moving North (likely). This allows me to secure an apple safely.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving DOWN is the safest path to an immediate score increase. It avoids the enemy and sets up a straight line to (7, 0). LEFT is also an option to avoid the enemy, but (7, 0) is closer than (0, 4) or (3, 9). I will move DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

It moves me closer to the apple at (7, 0) (Distance 2). However, the board at row 0 shows a gap between (5, 0) and the apple at (7, 0) where the enemy's body extends: `0 . . . . . . . A . .`. Specifically, the enemy body occupies (6, 4) to (8, 4) in previous turns, but looking at the current board map: `Row 4: A . . . . . T T T .` and `Row 5: . . . . . . . . 1 .`. The enemy is at (8, 5).

This increases the risk of a head-on collision or being cut off.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nEnemy #1 is at (8, 5). They are likely hunting the NE apples ((9, 8), (9, 6)). If I go RIGHT to (6, 1), I am moving into the same quadrant as the enemy, increasing danger. If I go DOWN to (5, 0), I am moving to a unique apple that the enemy is far away from (Manhattan distance is large, and the enemy is moving North/East). The enemy is currently at Y=5. I am at Y=1. The apple is at Y=0. The enemy would have to turn around and traverse the entire board to contest this apple. This makes the (7, 0) apple the safest target.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move **DOWN** to (5, 0). This is the safest move that directly progresses towards the nearest, least contested apple.\n\nDOWN",

The apples at (9, 8) and (9, 6) are valuable.\n*   **Path Clearing:** Moving LEFT takes me back to (6, 0), which is safe, but it retreats from the right side where the apples are. Moving RIGHT to (8, 0) advances my position. However, (8, 0) is very close to the wall at x=9. If I go RIGHT to (8, 0), I am potentially cornering myself if the enemy moves down.\n*   **Future Safety:**\n    *   If I go LEFT to (6, 0): I stay on the bottom row but open up the path to move up later. The enemy is at (8, 8), far away.\n    *   If I go RIGHT to (8, 0): I am at x=8. To get the apple at (9, 8), I would need to go up, but the enemy is at x=8, so if they move down, we collide. Actually, the enemy is at (8, 8). If I go to (8, 0), I am directly below the enemy (same x-coordinate).\n*   **Enemy Prediction:** The enemy is at (8, 8) and likely wants the apples at (9, 8) or (9, 6). They might move RIGHT to (9, 8) to eat an apple, or DOWN to (8, 7).\n*   **Decision:**\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (8, 0) aligns my x-coordinate with the enemy's head (x=8). If the enemy moves DOWN to (8, 7), they remain safe. If I stay at (8, 0), I am far away. However, if I move RIGHT to (8, 0), and the enemy moves DOWN, we are on the same column. This is risky if I plan to go up.\n    *   However, looking at the board, the enemy is at (8, 8). The apple at (9, 8) is adjacent to them. They will almost certainly move RIGHT to (9, 8) to eat it.\n    *   If the enemy moves RIGHT to (9, 8), they vacate (8, 8).\n    *   If I move RIGHT to (8, 0), I am moving away from the enemy. The distance is large.\n    *   Why LEFT? Left goes to (6, 0). This is safe, but it gives up the ground on the right side.\n    *   Why RIGHT? It moves me closer to the center/right side, potentially setting up for future apples. (8, 0) is safe. The enemy is moving away to (9, 8) (likely).\n    *   Let's look at the \"RIGHT\" option again. If I move to (8, 0), and the enemy moves to (9, 8), we are safe. If the enemy moves DOWN (unlikely, but possible), they go to (8, 7). Still no collision.\n    *   The only way RIGHT to (8, 0) is dangerous is if the enemy moves DOWN 8 times this turn, which is impossible.\n    *   Wait, is there a trap at (8, 0)? The board shows (8, 9) is empty, (9, 0) is wall. (8, 0) is open. To leave (8, 0), I can go UP (8, 1) - check body. Body is at (7,0), (6,0)... (8, 1) is empty (based on visual).\n    *   However, if I go LEFT to (6, 0), I am safe. But I am further from the apples on the right.\n    *   Let's reconsider the LEFT move. (6, 0) is my tail. If I go LEFT to (6, 0), I am moving back to where I was.\n    *   Let's look at the board visual again.\n    ```\n     9 . . . A . . . . . .\n     8 . . . . . . . . 1 A\n     7 . . . . . . . .

Enemy is at x=8 (y=8).\n    This puts us in the same column. If the enemy moves DOWN, we are closer.\n    However, the enemy wants the apple at (9, 8). They will likely go RIGHT.\n    Even if they go DOWN, they go to (8, 7).\n    This is safe.\n\n    Why LEFT?\n    Left to (6, 0). This is the tail.\n    It keeps me on the bottom row.\n    It prevents me from getting trapped on the right side wall (x=9).\n    The enemy is on the right side. The apples are on the right side.\n    If I chase them, I might get trapped.\n    The apples are at (9, 8) and (9, 6). To get these, I need to go up and right.\n    If I go RIGHT to (8, 0), I am committing to the right side.\n    If I go LEFT to (6, 0), I am staying safe and open to move up through the center or left.\n\n    Let's look at the \"unvisited\" area.\n    The area to the right (x=8, x=9) is where the enemy is.\n    The area to the left (x=0-5) is where my body was.\n    My tail is at (5, 0) (assuming full list: Head(7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)).\n    Wait, the body list is `[(6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]`.\n    If I eat the apple at (7, 0), the tail (5, 3) does *not* move.\n    So the new body is: `[(7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]`.\n    So (6, 0) is occupied by my body.\n    Wait, the previous move logic said \"Moving here collects the apple... my body will occupy [(6, 0), (5, 0)...]\".\n    Actually, if I eat an apple, I GROW. So the tail stays put.\n    So if I am at (7, 0) with apple eaten:\n    Head: (7, 0)\n    Body: (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)\n    Tail: (5, 3)\n\n    Now, considering moves from (7, 0):\n    UP (7, 1): T (Enemy body).\n    DOWN (7, -1): Wall.\n    LEFT (6, 0): MY BODY. (6, 0) is the second segment of my body.\n    RIGHT (8, 0): Empty.\n\n    Wait! The rationale for the last move said \"My body will occupy [(6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]\".\n    If I ate the apple, the tail (5, 3) stays. So the segment (5, 0) shifts to (5, 1), etc? No, the list grows.\n    Old: (7,0) -> (6,0) -> (5,0) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (5,3).\n    If I eat (7,0):\n    New Head: (7,0)\n    New Body: Old Head (6,0), Old Body (5,0, 5,1, 5,2, 5,3).\n    So (6,0) is occupied by my body.\n    Therefore, moving LEFT to (6, 0) is SUICIDE.\n\n    Let's re-verify the \"Last Move Rationale\".\n    \"My body will occupy [(6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)].\"\n    \"Moving back immediately is risky. But let's look at the Right move.\"\n    The user's rationale implies that if I move RIGHT to (7,0), I will be at (7,0).\n    If I ate the apple, I grow.\n    If I did NOT eat the apple (impossible, it was an 'A'), then I die? No, I eat it.\n    So I definitely ate it.\n    Therefore, my body occupies (6, 0).\n\n    So LEFT is blocked by my own body.\n    UP is blocked by Enemy Body (T).\n    DOWN is Wall.\n    RIGHT is the only safe move.\n\n    Wait, let me double check the board state provided in the prompt.\n    ```\n     9 . . .

T T 0 . .`\n    Indices:\n    5: T\n    6: T\n    7: 0\n\n    The prompt says: \"Body: [(6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]\".\n    So my body is:\n    (6, 0) -> T\n    (5, 0) -> T\n    (5, 1) -> T\n    (5, 2) -> T\n    (5, 3) -> T\n\n    The board shows \"T T\" at (5,0) and (6,0). This matches my body (head at 7,0).\n    The rest of the body is at (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). The board shows T at (5,1), (5,2) in the visual provided (y=1 row has T at x=5, y=2 row has T at x=5).\n    So the board visual is consistent with my body.\n\n    Now, I am at (7, 0).\n    Did I just move there? \"Your last move information: ... RIGHT\".\n    \"My last move information: -- Your last move information: -- **START LAST MOVE PICK** RIGHT\".\n    \"Current State (Turn 16/150): My Position: Head at (6, 0).\"\n    So I moved from (6, 0) to (7, 0) in turn 16.\n    In turn 16, I ate an apple at (7, 0).\n    So I grew.\n    So my body is now:\n    Head: (7, 0)\n    Segment 1: (6, 0) (previous head)\n    Segment 2: (5, 0) (previous segment 1)\n    Segment 3: (5, 1) (previous segment 2)\n    Segment 4: (5, 2) (previous segment 3)\n    Segment 5: (5, 3) (previous segment 4)\n    Tail: (5, 3) (since I grew, the tail stays).\n\n    Wait, did the tail stay? Yes, when you eat, the tail doesn't move this turn.\n    So the cell (5, 3) is occupied.\n    The cell (5, 2) is occupied.\n    ...\n    The cell (6, 0) is occupied.\n\n    So, potential moves from (7, 0):\n    UP (7, 1): Board shows 'T'. This is Enemy #1's body (Tail/Body). The enemy body is at x=8, but the board shows 'T' at (7, 1)?\n    Let's look at the board visual again carefully.\n    Row 1: `. . . . .

That was for turn 16 from (6,0).\n    Now I am at (7, 0).\n    Let's look at the board for (7, 1).\n    Row 1: `. . . . . T . . . .`\n    At x=7, y=1: `.` (Empty).\n    The prompt's rationale for the *previous* turn said \"UP (6, 1): Board shows 'T' (Enemy #1's Tail/Body)\".\n    Let's verify the enemy position.\n    Enemy #1 Head: (8, 8)\n    Enemy #1 Body: [(8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5)]\n    So (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7) are 'T'.\n    The board shows 'T' at (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3).

Correct.\n    (5, 3) -> T (Visual check: Row 3, x=5 is T). Correct.\n\n    So my body occupies: (6,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3).\n    My head is at (7, 0).\n    I ate an apple at (7, 0). So I grew.\n    So my tail (5, 3) did NOT move.\n    So (5, 3) is still occupied.\n\n    Now, evaluating moves from (7, 0):\n    1.  **UP (7, 1):**\n        *   Check Board: Row 1, x=7 is '.' (Empty).\n        *   Is it Enemy Body? Enemy is at x=8. (7,1) is not Enemy body.\n        *   Is it My Body?

T T 0 . .`\n    My head is at 7. My body is at 6 and 5.\n    Prompt's rationale for *previous* turn: \"UP (6, 1): Board shows 'T' (Enemy #1's Tail/Body).\"\n    But wait, Enemy #1 is at x=8. How can (6,1) be Enemy body?\n    Let's look at the board visual again.\n    `1 . . . . . T . . . .`\n    `2 . . . . . T . . . .`\n    `3 . . . . . T . . . .`\n    `4 A . . . . . . . . .`\n    `5 . . . . . . . . T .`\n    `6 . . . . . . . . T A`\n    `7 . . . . . . . . T .`\n    `8 . . . . . . . . 1 A`\n    `9 . . . . A . . . . .`\n\n    The 'T's on the left side (x=5, y=1,2,3) are my body.\n    The 'T's on the right side (x=8, y=5,6,7) are Enemy body.\n    The '1' at (8,8) is Enemy head.\n\n    So, my body is on the left.\n    Enemy body is on the right.\n\n    My head is at (7, 0).\n    My body is at (6,0), (5,0)... so (6,0) is occupied.\n\n    So LEFT (6, 0) is blocked by my body.\n    UP (7, 1) is empty.\n    RIGHT (8, 0) is empty.\n    DOWN is wall.\n\n    So I can go UP or RIGHT.\n\n    Strategy:\n    *   **UP (7, 1):**\n        *   Moves me towards the center of the board (y=1).\n        *   This opens up paths to the apples at (9, 8) and (9, 6).\n        *   It avoids the right wall.\n        *   The enemy is at (8, 8). If I go UP, I am moving towards the \"middle\" rows where the apples are.\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 0):**\n        *   Moves me to the wall (x=9 is right wall).\n        *   This traps me on the right side. If I go RIGHT to (8, 0), I can only go UP or LEFT (back to 7,0). I cannot go RIGHT (wall) or DOWN (wall).\n        *   This is a \"corner\" or \"wall\" trap. It reduces my freedom of movement.\n        *   The enemy is also on the right side (x=8). If I go to (8, 0) and the enemy stays on the right side, I might get boxed in.\n        *   However, if I go RIGHT, I might be closer to the apple at (9, 6)? No, (9, 6) is at y=6. I am at y=0. (8, 0) is just as close as (7, 0).\n        *   Actually, (8, 0) is further from the apples on the left (like (0,4)), but those are far.\n\n    Let's consider the immediate safety and future options.\n    If I go UP to (7, 1):\n    Next turn I can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n    If I go RIGHT to (8, 0):\n    Next turn I can only go UP or LEFT. I am pinned against the wall.\n\n    In Snake game, staying near walls is generally risky because it limits escape routes. The center is safer.\n    The apples are at y=8, y=6, y=9, y=4, y=3.\n    Moving UP brings me closer to ALL of them.\n    Moving RIGHT brings me closer to none of them (only moves in x).\n\n    Also, the enemy is at (8, 8). If I move UP, I am moving towards the \"danger zone\" where the enemy is, but I am moving vertically.\n    The enemy is on the far right (x=8). I am at x=7.\n    If I move UP to (7, 1), I am maintaining a distance from the enemy's column (x=8).\n    If I move RIGHT to (8, 0), I am entering the enemy's column.\n\n    If I go UP to (7, 1):\n    I can continue UP to (7, 2), etc.\n    I can move RIGHT to (8, 1) later.\n\n    If I go RIGHT to (8, 0):\n    I am at the edge. To get to the center, I have to turn back or go UP.\n\n    Let's look at the board state again.\n    `0 . . . . . T T 0 . .`\n    My head at (7,0). Body at (6,0) and (5,0).\n    If I move UP to (7, 1):\n    I am at (7, 1).\n    Next turn, my tail will be at (5, 3) (since I ate).\n    Wait, if I ate, I grew. So the tail stays at (5, 3).\n    So the body path is long: (7,0) -> (6,0) -> (5,0) -> (5,1) -> (5,2) -> (5,3).\n    If I move UP to (7, 1), my new body will include (7, 0).\n    My old body fills (6,0)... (5,3).\n    The cell (6, 1) is currently empty (visual check: row 1, x=6 is '.').\n    The cell (8, 1) is empty (visual check: row 1, x=8 is '.').\n    The cell (7, 2) is empty (visual check: row 2, x=7 is '.').\n    The cell (6, 0) will be occupied by my body.\n\n    Wait, the prompt says \"Snake #1 - Head: (8, 8), Body: [(8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5)]\".\n    The board shows 'T' at (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7). '1' at (8, 8).\n    There is an apple at (9, 8).\n    If I am Snake 0, I want to eat apples.\n\n    Apples:\n    (9, 8) - Near enemy.\n    (3, 9) - Top middle.\n    (0, 4) - Left.\n    (9, 6) - Right, middle height.\n    (0, 3) - Left.\n\n    My apples: 5. Enemy: 3.\n    I am ahead.\n\n    Long term plan:\n    I should avoid the enemy. The enemy is on the right side.\n    I should go UP and potentially LEFT or CENTER.\n    The apples on the left (0,4) and (0,3) are tempting but far.\n    The apple at (3, 9) is also far.\n\n    Let's look at the \"UP\" move again.\n    Is there any way (7, 1) is unsafe?\n    It's empty.\n    Enemy is at (8, 8). They might move DOWN, but that doesn't hit (7, 1).\n    They might move LEFT to (7, 8), but that's far.\n\n    Is there any way (8, 0) is unsafe?\n    It's empty.\n    Enemy is at (8, 8).\n    If enemy moves DOWN 8 times, impossible.\n    So (8, 0) is safe.\n\n    Which is better?\n    (8, 0) puts me against the wall.\n    (7, 1) puts me in the open.\n    I prefer (7, 1).\n\n    Let's check the prompt's \"Rules and win conditions\" about \"Moving directly backwards\".\n    \"If you move directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n    My head is at (7, 0). My body extends to (6, 0) (left), and (5, 0), etc.\n    Left is backwards. Left is death.\n    Up is safe. Right is safe.\n\n    Why did the user mention \"Enemy #1: Head: (8, 8)\"?\n    Maybe to warn me about the apple at (9, 8).\n    If I go UP, I am not contesting that apple immediately. That's fine. I don't need to rush into a fight.\n\n    Let's consider the \"RIGHT\" move one more time.\n    If I go RIGHT to (8, 0), I am on the same column as the enemy.\n    The enemy is at (8, 8).\n    If I go UP, I am at (7, 1), on a different column.\n    It is safer to stay on a different column than the enemy if possible, or at least not be directly below them in a way that limits movement.\n\n    Actually, looking at the board:\n    `0 . . . . . T T 0 . .`\n    If I go RIGHT to (8, 0), I am at x=8.\n    The enemy is at x=8.\n    This is \"same column\".\n    If I am at (8, 0) and the enemy is at (8, 8), if we both move towards each other, we collide.\n    If I go UP, I am at (7, 1). The enemy is at (8, 8).\n    If the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 8), we are closer.\n    If the enemy moves DOWN to (8, 7), we are closer in y but same x difference.\n\n    Wait, the prompt says \"Snake #1 - Head: (8, 8)\". The board shows \"1\" at (8, 8).\n    The board shows \"A\" at (9, 8).\n    The enemy will likely eat the apple at (9, 8) by moving RIGHT.\n    If the enemy moves RIGHT to (9, 8):\n    Their head moves to (9, 8).\n    Their body grows (or shifts).\n    They vacate (8, 8).\n\n    If I move UP to (7, 1):\n    I am safe. I am moving away from the enemy's likely movement (Right).\n    If I move RIGHT to (8, 0):\n    I am safe. I am moving towards the wall.\n\n    Let's look at the \"future options\" rule.\n    \"Among remaining safe moves, favor moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available\"\n    *   **UP (7, 1):** From (7, 1), I can go UP (7, 2), LEFT (6, 1), RIGHT (8, 1), DOWN (7, 0). All 4 directions are likely open (except DOWN which will be my tail, but usually safe if tail moves).\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 0):** From (8, 0), I can go UP (8, 1), LEFT (7, 0), DOWN (wall), RIGHT (wall). Only 2 directions.\n\n    The \"UP\" move offers significantly more freedom.\n\n    One final check: Is (7, 1) occupied by anything?\n    Board Row 1: `. . . . . T . . . .`\n    Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    x=7 is '.'.\n    Is it Enemy body? No, Enemy is x=8.\n    Is it My body? My body is x=6 and x=5.\n    Is it My tail? My tail is at (5, 3).\n    Is it an apple? No, apples are at (9,8), (3,9), (0,4), (9,6), (0,3).\n\n    So (7, 1) is empty.\n\n    Decision: Move UP.\n    This keeps me away from the wall and away from the enemy's column (for now).\n    It opens up the center of the board.\n\n    Plan for next turn:\n    If I go UP to (7, 1), next turn I will be at (7, 1). My tail will have moved from (5, 3) to (5, 2) (assuming I don't eat).\n    I will look for apples at (3, 9) or (0, 4).\n    I will watch the enemy. If they eat the apple at (9, 8), they might go for (9, 6).\n    I will try to stay central.\n\n    Wait, I should double check the board visual one last time to be sure I'm not missing a snake.\n    The board shows \"1\" at (8, 8).\n    The board shows \"0\" at (7, 0).\n    The board shows \"T\"s for bodies.\n    There are no other snakes.\n\n    Also, check for \"Head-on collision\".\n    If I move UP to (7, 1).\n    If the enemy moves DOWN to (8, 7). (No collision).\n    If the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 8). (No collision).\n    If the enemy moves DOWN to (7, 8)? No, enemy is at (8, 8).\n    Actually, if the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 8) and I move UP to (7, 1), no collision.\n    If the enemy moves DOWN to (8, 7), no collision.\n    If the enemy moves RIGHT to (9, 8), no collision.\n    If the enemy moves UP (impossible).\n\n    If I move RIGHT to (8, 0).\n    If the enemy moves DOWN to (8, 7).

(No collision).\n    If the enemy moves DOWN to (8, 0). (HEAD ON COLLISION).\n    This is extremely unlikely as the enemy would have to move down 8 times. But theoretically possible if they are chasing something down there? No, they are chasing apples up top.\n\n    So UP is the strategically superior move.\n\n    One detail: The prompt says \"My body: [(6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]\".\n    And I just moved to (7, 0) and ate an apple.\n    So my body is now: [(7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)].\n    Wait, if I ate, the tail (5, 3) stays. So the old tail (5, 3) is still there.\n    So the body is: Head (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3) (Tail).\n    So (5, 3) is occupied.\n    (5, 2) is occupied.\n    (5, 1) is occupied.\n    (5, 0) is occupied.\n    (6, 0) is occupied.\n    (7, 0) is head.\n\n    So my body is on the left side.\n    Moving UP to (7, 1) puts my head at (7, 1).\n    My body will be at (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2).\n    (5, 3) will move to (5, 2) (Wait, no. If I ate, the tail stays. If I didn't eat this turn, the tail moves).\n    I ate in the *previous* turn (turn 16).\n    Now it is turn 17.\n    I am moving NOW.\n    If I move to (7, 1), I did NOT eat (assuming no apple there).\n    So the tail (5, 3) will move to (5, 2).\n    Wait, if the tail moves, then (5, 2) becomes the new tail.\n    The old (5, 2) moves to (5, 1)?\n    Wait, the list is head-to-tail.\n    Old list (after eating): Head(7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3).\n    If I move UP to (7, 1) (No apple):\n    New Head: (7, 1).\n    New Body: Old Head (7, 0), Old Segment 1 (6, 0), Old Segment 2 (5, 0), Old Segment 3 (5, 1), Old Segment 4 (5, 2).\n    Tail: Old Segment 4 (5, 2).\n    So the cell (5, 3) becomes EMPTY.\n    The cell (5, 2) becomes occupied (as the tail).\n    The cell (5, 1) is occupied (segment 3).\n    The cell (5, 0) is occupied (segment 2).\n    The cell (6, 0) is occupied (segment 1).\n    The cell (7, 0) is occupied (head/segment).\n\n    This means (5, 2) is occupied.\n    What if I want to move to (5, 2) in the future?\n    I am at (7, 1). I am far from (5, 2).\n\n    This confirms UP is safe.\n\n    Double check: Is there any apple at (7, 1)?\n    Apples are at: (9, 8), (3, 9), (0, 4), (9, 6), (0, 3).\n    No. So no growth.\n\n    So UP is the move.\n\n    One last check on the \"Last Move Rationale\" provided by the user.\n    They said \"I will move RIGHT to (7, 0). This is the only safe move...\"\n    Wait, the user said \"RIGHT\" in the rationale, and the move was RIGHT.\n    Now I am at (7, 0).\n    The user's rationale for the *previous* turn said:\n    \"UP (6, 1): Board shows 'T' (Enemy #1's Tail/Body). DEADLY.\"\n    \"LEFT (5, 0): ... Usually, the tail moves forward... But let's look at the Right move.\"\n    \"RIGHT (7, 0): Board shows 'A' (Apple). Safe.\"\n\n    Let's verify \"UP (6, 1): Board shows 'T'\".\n    My head was at (6, 0).\n    The board visual shows:\n    Row 1: `. . . . . T . . . .`\n    At x=6, y=1: `.`\n    Wait, the user's rationale said \"Based on the updated board state from my move to (6, 0)\".\n    And \"Board shows 'T' (Enemy #1's Tail/Body)\".\n    But the *current* board state (Turn 17) shows:\n    Row 1: `. . . . . T . . . .`\n    At x=6: `.`.\n    Is it possible the user's rationale had an error?\n    Or maybe the Enemy moved?\n    Turn 16: Enemy Head (8, 8). Body (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5).\n    Turn 17 (Current): Enemy Head (8, 8). Body (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5). (Unchanged in the prompt's description).\n    Wait, the prompt says \"Enemy snakes: Snake #1 - Head: (8, 8)\".\n    In the *previous* turn (Turn 16), the prompt said:\n    \"Enemy snakes: Snake #1 - Head: (8, 8)\".\n    Wait, no. The previous turn info said \"Enemy #1: Head at (8, 7)\".\n    Let's check.\n    \"Your last move information: ... Current State (Turn 16/150): Enemy #1: Head at (8, 7).\"\n    Current State (Turn 17/150): Enemy #1: Head: (8, 8).\n    So the enemy moved UP from (8, 7) to (8, 8).\n\n    So, at Turn 16 (when I was at 6, 0):\n    Enemy Head was (8, 7).\n    Enemy Body was (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4).\n    The user's rationale said \"UP (6, 1): Board shows 'T' (Enemy #1's Tail/Body)\".\n    Let's visualize the board at Turn 16.\n    (This is hard without the full board state, but I trust the prompt's \"Current State\" description).\n    If the user said (6, 1) was 'T' (Enemy Body), and the enemy was at x=8, this is impossible unless the board visual provided in the prompt is wrong or I am misreading the prompt's rationale.\n    \n    However, I must trust the *current* board state provided in the prompt for Turn 17.\n    Current Board:\n    Row 1: `. . . . . T . . . .`\n    This 'T' is at x=5. It is MY body.\n    The user's rationale for Turn 16 said \"UP (6, 1): Board shows 'T' (Enemy #1's Tail/Body)\".\n    Maybe the user made a mistake in the rationale text, or the board state shifted?\n    Regardless, for MY turn (Turn 17), I have the CURRENT board state.\n    \n    My head (7, 0).\n    My body (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3).\n    Enemy Head (8, 8).\n    Enemy Body (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5).\n    \n    Potential moves:\n    UP (7, 1): Empty. Safe.\n    LEFT (6, 0): My body. Deadly.\n    DOWN: Wall. Deadly.\n    RIGHT (8, 0): Empty. Safe.\n    \n    Strategy:\n    Right is safer (center vs wall).\n    So UP.\n\n    Final check: Is there an apple at (7, 1)?\n    No.\n    \n    So I will go UP.\n\n    Wait, I should check if the \"T\" at (6, 1) in the user's rationale was referring to something else.\n    Maybe the board visual in the prompt is different from what the user sees?\n    No, I have to use the prompt's board.\n    Prompt's board: Row 1, x=6 is '.'.\n    So UP is safe.\n\n    What about (8, 1)?\n    Row 1: `... . . . . . T . . . .` (x=8 is `.`\n    So RIGHT is safe.\n\n    Why prefer UP over RIGHT?\n    UP avoids the wall.\n    UP moves towards the center.\n    UP moves towards the apples (y=3, 4, 6, 8, 9).\n    RIGHT moves towards the wall (x=9).\n\n    So UP is the logical choice.\n\n    One nuance: The enemy is at (8, 8).\n    If I go UP, I go to (7, 1).\n    If the enemy goes LEFT, they go to (7, 8).\n    If the enemy goes DOWN, they go to (8, 7).\n    If the enemy goes RIGHT, they go to (9, 8).\n    All are safe for me.\n    \n    If I go RIGHT, I go to (8, 0).\n    If the enemy goes DOWN, they go to (8, 7).\n    Still safe.\n    If the enemy goes DOWN... (as discussed).\n\n    The only advantage of RIGHT is that I might be closer to an apple at (9, 6) or (9, 8)?\n    I am at y=0. They are at y=6 and y=8.\n    Moving RIGHT doesn't help me get closer to them in terms of distance (Manhattan distance).\n    Manhattan distance from (7, 0) to (9, 8) is |9-7| + |8-0| = 2 + 8 = 10.\n    Manhattan distance from (8, 0) to (9, 8) is |9-8| + |8-0| = 1 + 8 = 9.\n    So RIGHT is slightly closer to the top-right apple.\n    \n    Manhattan distance from (7, 0) to (9, 6) is |9-7| + |6-0| = 2 + 6 = 8.\n    Manhattan distance from (8, 0) to (9, 6) is |9-8| + |6-0| = 1 + 6 = 7.\n    So RIGHT is slightly closer to the mid-right apple.\n\n    However, being closer to the right side means I am closer to the enemy.\n    The enemy is at (8, 8).\n    The apples at (9, 8) and (9, 6) are right next to the enemy.\n    Contesting them might be dangerous.\n    \n    The apples at (0, 4) and (0, 3) are on the left.\n    The apple at (3, 9) is in the middle top.\n    \n    If I go UP to (7, 1), I am positioned to move towards the center (x=4, y=9) or the left (x=0, y=4).\n    If I go RIGHT to (8, 0), I am committing to the right side.\n    \n    Given the enemy is on the right side, I should probably avoid the right side to avoid conflict.\n    I am ahead in apples (5 vs 3). I don't need to risk a fight.\n    I should play safe.\n    \n    Safe play = UP.\n\n    Wait, the prompt says \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n    So UP increases Y. Correct.\n\n    I will stick with UP.\n\n    Short-term plan:\n    Move UP. Avoid the enemy. Scout for apples in the middle or left side. Don't get trapped on the right wall.\n\n    Final decision: UP.\n\n    One edge case: \"If you move directly backwards into your own body... you die.\"\n    Moving UP from (7, 0) is not backwards (Backwards would be LEFT to (6, 0)).\n    So it's safe.\n\n    Another check: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell... both snakes die.\"\n    If I go UP to (7, 1), and the enemy goes DOWN to (8, 7)? No collision.\n    If the enemy goes LEFT to (7, 8)? No collision.\n    If the enemy goes DOWN to (7, 8)? No.\n\n    I'm confident in UP.\n\n    Wait, looking at the board again.\n    `0 . . . . . T T 0 . .`\n    My head is at 7.\n    My body is at 6 and 5.\n    The 'T' at 6 is my body.\n    The 'T' at 5 is my body.\n    So if I go LEFT to 6, I hit my body.\n    \n    If I go UP to (7, 1):\n    The board shows `.` at (7, 1).\n    Is there any 'T' at (7, 1)? No.\n    \n    If I go RIGHT to (8, 0):\n    The board shows `.` at (8, 0).\n    \n    So UP and RIGHT are both physically empty.\n\n    Strategic choice: Center vs Wall.\n    Center wins.\n\n    What if I am forced to go RIGHT next turn?\n    If I go UP, I have options.\n    If I go RIGHT, I have fewer options.\n\n    So UP.\n\n    One final check on the apples.\n    Apples at: (9, 8), (3, 9), (0, 4), (9, 6), (0, 3).\n    My score: 5.\n    Enemy: 3.\n    \n    If I go UP, I am moving towards (3, 9) and (0, 4) and (0, 3).\n    If I go RIGHT, I am moving towards (9, 8) and (9, 6).\n    \n    Since I am winning, I should play safe. The apples on the right are guarded by the enemy.\n    The apples on the left are open.\n    However, going UP doesn't take me directly left. It takes me up.\n    From UP, I can go LEFT to (6, 1), etc, and eventually snake my way to the left side if needed.\n    \n    If I go RIGHT, I am committing to the right side.\n    The enemy is on the right side.\n    The right side has the wall.\n    The right side has the enemy.\n    The right side has apples.\n    This is a high-risk, high-reward area.\n    Since I am ahead, I should take low risk.\n    \n    Low risk = UP (Center).\n\n    I will formulate the plan.\n    \"Plan: Move UP to (7, 1) to move towards the center and away from the enemy on the right side. Avoid the wall. Scout for safer apples on the left/center.\"\n    \n    Move: UP.\n\n    One tiny detail: \"All snakes move simultaneously\".\n    If the enemy moves DOWN to (8, 7), and I move UP to (7, 1), we are safe.\n    If the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 8), and I move UP to (7, 1), we are safe.\n\n    What if the enemy moves DOWN to (8, 7), and then next turn moves DOWN to (8, 6), etc?\n    They are moving down, away from me.\n\n    What if the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 8)?\n    They are moving closer to my x-coordinate.\n    But I am at y=1 and they are at y=8. Huge gap.\n\n    So UP is safe.\n\n    I will write the plan and then the move.\n\n    Note: The user's last move was RIGHT to (7, 0).\n    The user's rationale said \"This is the only safe move\".\n    My analysis shows UP and RIGHT are safe.\n    I am choosing UP for strategic reasons (avoiding wall/enemy).\n\n    I will write:\n    Plan: Move UP to the center. Avoid the enemy on the right side and the wall. This keeps future options open for apples on the left or center of the board.\n\n    Move: UP\n\n    Wait, I should check if the enemy might be moving to block me.\n    If I go UP to (7, 1).\n    Enemy at (8, 8).\n    No.\n\n    Okay, I'm done.\n\n    One last check: \"Moving directly backwards... you die.\"\n    From (7, 0), backwards is (6, 0).\n    (6, 0) is my body.\n    So LEFT is death.\n    UP is safe.\n    RIGHT is safe.\n\n    I'll choose UP.\n\n    The prompt asks for \"a short long-term plan or strategy note\".\n    I will write that.\n\n    Then \"UP\".\n\n    I will ensure the last line is exactly \"UP\".\n\n    Let's double check the coordinate system.\n    \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n    \"Decreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\"\n    So UP means y+1.\n    (7, 0) -> (7, 1).\n    Correct.\n\n    I am ready.\n\n    One thought: What if the enemy moves DOWN to (8, 7) and I move UP to (7, 1).\n    We are safe.\n    What if the enemy moves DOWN to (8, 7) and I move RIGHT to (8, 0).\n    We are safe.\n    \n    Why is UP better than RIGHT?\n    Future moves.\n    From (7, 1): I can go to (7, 2), (6, 1), (8, 1). 3 directions (assuming (7, 0) will be occupied by my body but it will move).\n    Actually, from (7, 1), my body will be at (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2).\n    So (6, 1) is empty. (8, 1) is empty. (7, 2) is empty.\n    3 directions.\n    \n    From (8, 0): I can go to (8, 1), (7, 0).\n    (7, 0) will be my body (previous head).\n    Wait, if I move to (8, 0), my previous head is (7, 0).\n    So (7, 0) becomes part of my body.\n    So if I am at (8, 0), I cannot go back to (7, 0) immediately.\n    So from (8, 0), I can only go UP (8, 1) or LEFT is blocked by body? No, LEFT is (7, 0), which is my body. So LEFT is blocked.\n    UP is (8, 1).\n    DOWN is wall.\n    RIGHT is wall.\n    So from (8, 0), I am forced to go UP.\n    This is a \"forced move\".\n    If (8, 1) is then blocked (by enemy or body), I die.\n    \n    From (7, 1):\n    I can go UP (7, 2), LEFT (6, 1), RIGHT (8, 1).\n    I have options.\n    \n    This confirms UP is much better.\n\n    Final check:\n    (7, 0) -> (7, 1) (UP).\n    (7, 0) -> (8, 0) (RIGHT).\n    (8, 0) is a trap corner.\n    (7, 1) is open.\n\n    Moving UP.\n\n    Plan text:\n    \"Move UP to (7, 1) to open up movement options and avoid getting trapped against the right wall. The enemy is on the right side, so staying central or moving left is safer.\"\n\n    Wait, the prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next turns.\"\n    I should keep it concise.\n\n    \"Plan: Move UP to (7, 1). This avoids the wall at x=9 and the enemy snake currently on the right side. It keeps options open to move towards the center or left side apples.\"\n\n    Move: UP\n\n    Wait, the prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\n    So I must put the move on the last line.\n    And before that, the plan.\n\n    I'll write the plan first.\n\n    Actually, the prompt says \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\" AND \"You may also write a short long-term plan...\".\n    So I can explain reasoning and then the plan.\n    Or just the plan.\n    I'll do: Reasoning (brief), Plan, Move.\n\n    Let's make sure I'm not missing an apple.\n    Apples at: (9, 8), (3, 9), (0, 4), (9, 6), (0, 3).\n    None are at (7, 1).\n    None are at (8, 0).\n    So neither move eats an apple immediately.\n    So the move is purely positional.\n\n    Positional play: Safety > Score (when leading).\n    Safety: UP (Center) > RIGHT (Wall).\n    So UP.\n\n    I am confident.\n\n    Wait, I need to make sure I don't hit the \"Enemy Tail\" mentioned in the previous turn's rationale.\n    Previous rationale: \"UP (6, 1): Board shows 'T' (Enemy #1's Tail/Body)\".\n    This was for Turn 16, from (6, 0).\n    Now it is Turn 17.\n    The enemy moved from (8, 7) to (8, 8).\n    Their body is now (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5).\n    So (6, 1) is definitely not enemy body.\n    (6, 1) is empty (visual check: row 1, x=6 is '.').\n    \n    So my move UP to (7, 1) is safe.\n\n    Final check on \"HEAD ON COLLISION\".\n    If I go UP to (7, 1).\n    If the enemy goes DOWN to (8, 7). (No collision).\n    If the enemy goes DOWN to (7, 7)? No, they are at x=8.\n    If the enemy goes LEFT to (7, 8). (No collision).\n    If the enemy goes LEFT to (7, 1)? Impossible, they are at y=8.\n    \n    So UP is safe.\n\n    I will proceed.\n\n    One minor detail: \"My body: [(6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]\".\n    If I move UP to (7, 1), I did not eat.\n    So the tail (5, 3) moves forward to (5, 2).\n    So my body becomes: [(7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2)].\n    The cell (5, 3) becomes empty.\n    This is standard snake mechanics.\n\n    I am ready.\n\n    Response format:\n    Plan...\n    UP\n\n    I will write:\n    \"Plan: Move UP to (7, 1). This moves me away from the right wall and the enemy on the right side. It opens up movement options to the left or center of the board, which is safer.\"\n    \"UP\"\n\n    Wait, the prompt says \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\".\n    I have done that in my internal monologue.\n    I will include a brief reasoning and the plan.\n\n    Actually, the prompt says \"You may think out loud... You may also write a short long-term plan...\".\n    This implies I can do either or both.\n    I'll combine them into a single explanation block, then the move.\n\n    Let's go.\n\n    One detail: The user's last rationale ended with \"Decision: I will move RIGHT to (7, 0). This is the only safe move...\"\n    It's good that I found TWO safe moves. It means I am optimizing better.\n\n    My moves:\n    1. RIGHT (8, 0) - Safe, but traps me.\n    2. UP (7, 1) - Safe, and keeps me free.\n\n    So UP.\n\n    Final confirmation:\n    Board:\n    `0 . . . . . T T 0 . .`\n    My head at 7. Body at 6, 5.\n    If I go UP, I go to y=1.\n    Row 1: `. . . . . T . . . .`\n    At x=7: `.`.\n    At x=8: `.`.\n    At x=6: `.`.\n    At x=5: `T` (My body).\n\n    If I go RIGHT, I go to x=8.\n    Row 0: `. . . . . T T 0 . .`\n    At x=8: `.`.\n\n    Both are empty.\n    UP is better strategy.\n\n    Answer is UP.\n\n    Wait, I should double check if the \"T\" at (5, 1) is blocking UP from (7, 0).\n    No, (5, 1) is at x=5.\n    I am at x=7.\n    Distance is 2 units.\n\n    I am good.\n\n    One last check on the rules: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow...\". I checked, no apples at (7, 1).\n\n    I will write the response now.\n\n    Reasoning:\n    Current position: (7, 0).\n    Safe moves: UP, RIGHT.\n    Unsafe: LEFT (self), DOWN (wall).\n    UP (7, 1) is empty and leads to center.\n    RIGHT (8, 0) is empty but leads to wall/corner.\n    Strategy: Avoid walls/enemy.\n    Decision: UP.\n\n    Plan:\n    \"Move UP to (7, 1) to stay mobile and avoid the right wall. I will look to move towards the center or left side where the enemy is not present.\"\n\n    Wait, the prompt says \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n    So I will put the plan text first, then the move.\n\n    I will write:\n    Plan: Move UP to (7, 1) to avoid the right wall and maintain central positioning. This keeps options open and avoids the enemy on the right.\n    UP\n\n    This looks correct.\n\n    One detail: \"Your last move information: ... RIGHT\".\n    So I am at (7, 0).\n    The prompt says \"My Position: Head at (7, 0). Body: ...\".\n    Yes.\n\n    I am set.\n\n    Wait, I'll just write the \"think out loud\" part too if needed, but the prompt says \"You may think out loud...\".\n    I'll keep it simple: Plan + Move.\n\n    Actually, I should probably not include \"My reasoning:\" headers, just free text.\n    \"Based on the current board state...\"\n    \"Moving UP opens up the board...\"\n    \"Plan: ...\"\n    \"UP\"\n\n    Let's stick to the \"Plan\" format suggested in the prompt: \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n    I'll just put the plan text.\n\n    Final check: Is there any apple at (7, 1)?\n    No.\n    Is there any apple at (8, 0)?\n    No.\n    So neither move scores.\n    It is purely about positioning.\n    Since I am winning (5 vs 3), I should position defensively (center) rather than aggressively (wall).\n\n    UP is correct.\n\n    I will output:\n    Plan: Move UP to (7, 1) to move towards the center of the board and avoid the right wall. This maintains distance from the enemy snake on the right and keeps escape routes open.\n    UP\n\n    Wait, I should check if the \"Enemy Snake #1\" is actually a threat.\n    They are at (8, 8).\n    They are far.\n    But they are on the right side.\n    If I go to (8, 0), I am on the right side.\n    If they chase me, I might get trapped.\n    If I go UP, I am central.\n    If they go to the apples, I am safe.\n    So UP is safer.\n\n    I'm done.\n\n    One thing: \"Turn: 17 / 150\".\n    This is early.\n    Board is open.\n    Wall is dangerous.\n    Avoid wall.\n\n    UP.\n\n    Response structure:\n    [Optional reasoning]\n    [Plan]\n    [Move]\n\n    I will just write the Plan and Move to be concise and fit the instruction \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\n    I will write:\n\n    Plan: Move UP to (7, 1). This keeps me away from the right wall and the enemy snake. It allows me to navigate towards the center or left side for future apples.\n    UP\n\n    Wait, the prompt says \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\".\n    I'll add a brief sentence about why I'm not going RIGHT.\n    \n    \"I will move UP to (7, 1) because it keeps me mobile and away from the right wall. Moving RIGHT to (8, 0) would trap me against the wall.\"\n    \"Plan: Maintain central positioning to avoid the enemy and walls.\"\n    \"UP\"\n\n    Wait, \"The final non-empty line... must be exactly one word\".\n    So I cannot have two lines of text after the reasoning?\n    No, I can have multiple lines, but the LAST line must be the move.\n    So:\n    Line 1: Reasoning\n    Line 2: Plan\n    Line 3: UP\n\n    That should work.\n\n    Or just:\n    Line 1: Plan\n    Line 2: UP\n\n    I'll go with:\n    Reasoning: I am at (7, 0). Safe moves are UP and RIGHT. UP leads to the open center, RIGHT leads to the wall. I prefer the center.\n    Plan: Move UP to stay flexible and safe.\n    UP\n\n    I'll make it concise.\n\n    Final check on \"If you move directly backwards into your own body\".\n    From (7, 0), my body is at (6, 0) to the left.\n    So LEFT is backwards.\n    I am not moving LEFT.\n    So I am safe.\n\n    I am confident.\n\n    One thing: \"All snakes move simultaneously\".\n    If I move UP to (7, 1), and the enemy moves DOWN to (8, 7), we are safe.\n    If I move UP to (7, 1), and the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 8), we are safe.\n    If I move UP to (7, 1), and the enemy moves DOWN to (7, 8)? No, enemy at x=8.\n\n    I am ready.\n\n    I will write:\n    \"I will move UP to (7, 1) to keep my options open and avoid the right wall. Moving RIGHT would trap me against the wall.\"\n    \"Plan: Navigate towards the center to access apples on the left and center of the board.\"\n    \"UP\"\n\n    Wait, the prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note... Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n    I will put the plan text immediately before the move.\n\n    \"Plan: Move UP to maintain central positioning and avoid the right wall.\"\n    \"UP\"\n\n    This is good.\n\n    Wait, I should confirm the \"turn\" number. 17/150. Plenty of time.\n    Don't rush into a corner.\n\n    Okay, submitting.\n\n    One last check: The prompt asks \"Based on the updated board state from my move to (6, 0)?\".\n    No, that was the context from the user.\n    My current state is Turn 17.\n    My head is at (7, 0).\n    My body is...\n    Wait, the prompt says \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (7, 0), Body: [(6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3)]\".\n    This is the state *before* I move in Turn 17.\n    Correct.\n\n    I will proceed.\n\n    Plan: Move UP to (7, 1) to avoid the right wall and maintain open movement options.\n    UP",

If I move here, I will be pinned against the wall. My only safe move next turn would be UP to (8, 1), creating a \"single-file\" escape route. This is risky and limits my options.\n- **Move UP (7, 1):** This moves me into the center of the board. From (7, 1), I will have multiple escape routes (UP, LEFT, or RIGHT) and can navigate towards the apples in the upper portion of the board or the safe zones on the left.\n\nSince I am currently leading (5 apples vs 4), I should prioritize safety and board control over risky aggression. Moving UP maintains my distance from the enemy snake (currently on the right side) and keeps my movement options open.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (7, 1) to stay central and avoid the right wall.

Enemy cannot reach (9,6) this turn \u2192 no head-on collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple benefit**  \nDOWN moves me onto apple (9,6) \u2192 I grow to length 6, score 5 apples. Enemy has 5 apples currently, so I tie them if I eat it.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future flexibility after eating apple**  \nNext turn head at (9,6), body length 6:  \nPossible safe moves then:  \n- UP \u2192 (9,7): currently empty (my old head becomes body part, but that\u2019s (9,7) \u2192 will be body next turn, so unsafe next turn if I go back up).

Let's trace: new head at (9,6), old head (9,7) becomes new neck, then (9,8), etc. So (9,7) will be my body next turn, so UP next turn would be into myself \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,5): empty now, likely safe unless enemy moves there.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,6): currently empty, will it be my body next turn? My current tail is (8,6), but after moving and growing, tail stays (8,6) because eating apple means tail doesn\u2019t move. So (8,6) remains occupied by tail \u2192 LEFT would be into my own tail \u2192 death next turn.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 death.  \n\nSo next turn only DOWN might be safe, unless enemy occupies (9,5). That\u2019s risky.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Is there any alternative?**  \nNo, only DOWN is safe now.

But enemy is far at (7,2) \u2192 unlikely to reach (9,5) in one move. Still, I must check next turn:  \n- If (9,5) is free and enemy not moving there, go DOWN.  \n- If (9,5) is occupied, I have no safe move \u2192 death. But enemy would need to move from (7,2) to (9,5) in one turn \u2192 impossible (distance > 2). So (9,5) should be safe next turn.  \n\nThus DOWN now is fine.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term note for next self**  \nAfter moving to (9,6) and growing, next turn only DOWN to (9,5) will be safe (UP into body, LEFT into tail, RIGHT off board). Take DOWN next turn unless enemy somehow threatens (9,5). Then you\u2019ll have more options after moving off bottom edge. Keep tracking enemy\u2019s position; they may go for apples on left side.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

This seems the most flexible path, avoiding the wall.\n*   **DOWN to (8, 1):** This moves towards the apple at (9,1). This is a very short-term goal. However, if I go DOWN to (8,1), I am close to the bottom wall. To get to (9,1), I would need to go RIGHT to (9,1). If I eat that apple, I grow, potentially trapping myself against the bottom edge or my own tail. It's a riskier path compared to the open space above.\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 2):** This moves to the right wall. From there, I am limited to UP or DOWN (LEFT would be into my own body at (8,2)).

Body: [(9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6)] (length 5).  \n\n- UP \u2192 (9,7): my own body (second segment) \u2192 death \u2192 NO.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,5): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,6): my own body (last segment, tail) \u2192 moving into tail is safe only if tail moves away this turn? Wait: after I move, my tail will stay in place because I am not eating an apple (no apple at (9,5)). So my body will move: new head at (9,5), old head (9,6) becomes neck, rest shift, tail (8,6) moves to (8,7)? Let's check: body length 5, no apple eaten \u2192 tail moves forward. Current tail is (8,6). When I move, the segment at (8,6) becomes the new tail? Actually: head moves to (9,5), each body segment shifts forward, so the last segment (old tail) is removed. That means (8,6) will be empty after my move. So LEFT to (8,6) is safe this turn because it's currently occupied but will be vacated when the tail moves. But careful: simultaneous movement means collisions are checked against positions *before* anyone moves. Since (8,6) is currently part of my body, moving into it now would be suicide. So LEFT is unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 death \u2192 NO.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN only? LEFT is into my own body now \u2192 unsafe. Yes, only DOWN is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy possible moves & head-on collision risk**  \nEnemy head: (8,2). Body: [(7,2), (7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0)].  \n\nEnemy safe moves from (8,2):  \n- UP \u2192 (8,3): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,1): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,2): enemy's own body \u2192 death \u2192 NO.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,2): empty.  \n\nEnemy can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nMy only safe move is DOWN to (9,5). Enemy cannot reach (9,5) in one move \u2192 no head-on collision risk.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple benefit**  \nNo apple at (9,5), so I don\u2019t grow. My length stays 5, score stays 5 apples.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future flexibility after this move**  \nNext turn head at (9,5), body: [(9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (8,7)] (tail at (8,7)).  \n\nPossible moves from (9,5) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (9,6): my own body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,4): empty now.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,5): empty now.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo next turn I\u2019d have DOWN and LEFT as options. That\u2019s better than last turn\u2019s single option.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI need apples to win. Apples at (3,9), (0,4), (0,3), (9,1), (7,6).  \nClosest apple to (9,5) is (9,1) straight down, but enemy is near (8,2). Going straight down risks head-on collision if enemy goes RIGHT then DOWN later.  \nBetter to go LEFT toward center for flexibility and toward apples (0,4), (0,3).  \nNext turn I can go LEFT to (8,5), then maybe DOWN/LEFT toward lower-left apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Note for next turn:**  \nFrom (9,5), safe moves: DOWN to (9,4) or LEFT to (8,5).  \nPrefer LEFT to (8,5) to get away from right edge and open more options.  \nEnemy at (8,2) might go UP/DOWN/RIGHT; watch if they move toward (9,1) apple.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (9,2), they could block my path to (9,1).  \nSo maybe avoid going straight down immediately; instead work leftward for safety and apples on left side.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Based on the board representation `(8, 5) = 1` (head) and `(9, 5) = T` (tail), the enemy's body is to the right. This means the enemy likely cannot move LEFT towards me, as that would require moving into its own tail. It is most likely to move UP, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n*   **Potential Collisions:**\n    *   **UP (7, 4):** This move would bring my head to (7, 4). The enemy head is at (8, 5). If the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 5), we would suffer a head-on collision (both die). If the enemy moves DOWN to (8, 4), we would collide with the enemy head while I am in (7, 4) (I die, enemy lives).\n    *   **DOWN (7, 2):** This moves me back to my previous position (7, 2). The enemy cannot reach (7, 2) this turn because it is at (8, 5) (Manhattan distance 4). This is safe.\n    *   **LEFT (6, 3):** Moves me away from the enemy. The enemy cannot reach (6, 3) (distance 3). Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 3):** Moves me into my own body (my body starts at (8, 3)). This kills me immediately. Invalid move.\n\n**Strategy:**\n*   **Apple (9, 1):** Currently close, but requires moving through the right side where the enemy is active. Taking RIGHT is blocked by my body, and UP risks collision.\n*   **Left Apples ((0,3), (0,4), (3,9)):** Moving LEFT moves me away from the immediate enemy threat and positions me to access the left side of the board.\n*   **Safety:** DOWN is safe, but turns me around to chase apples I just left. LEFT is safe and progresses towards a less contested area of the board.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI cannot move RIGHT (death). Moving UP or DOWN risks immediate collision with the enemy due to proximity and simultaneous movement. Moving LEFT is safe (enemy is too far) and strategic (moves towards the left cluster of apples).\n\nLEFT",

If it goes UP, it could threaten (7,4) and then (7,5)/(7,6) area next turn. If I move LEFT to (7,5), I\u2019m adjacent vertically to enemy if it goes UP to (7,4) \u2014 that\u2019s risky for head-on collision next turn.  \nIf I go UP to (8,6), I\u2019m farther from enemy\u2019s immediate path and can grab (7,6) apple next turn before enemy might reach it.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP gives proximity to closest apple (7,6) while keeping distance from enemy\u2019s possible moves this turn. It also leaves good future options. LEFT gives maximum next-turn flexibility but puts me adjacent to enemy\u2019s potential UP move, increasing risk next turn. DOWN moves away from most apples and toward bottom edge with less upside.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go UP now to (8,6), next turn strongly consider moving LEFT to (7,6) to eat the apple if enemy hasn\u2019t taken it. Watch enemy\u2019s move this turn \u2014 if enemy goes UP to (7,4), then (7,6) may still be safe for me to take next turn because enemy would need two moves to reach it (7,4 \u2192 7,5 \u2192 7,6). If enemy goes LEFT, then (7,6) is even safer. Prioritize eating (7,6) next turn if safe.\n\nUP",

It cannot move Down or Right. It must move Up or Left.\n\n3.  **Move Safety Evaluation:**\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 3):** My body is there. **DEAD**.\n    *   **UP (6, 4):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (6, 2):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT (5, 3):** Empty. Safe.\n\n4.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   I am tied 5-5 in apples. I need to collect apples while staying safe.\n    *   The apple at (7, 6) is close, but moving UP towards it puts me at (6, 4). The enemy is at (8, 6).\n    *   If I move UP to (6, 4), and the enemy moves LEFT to (7, 6) (eating the apple), the distance between us becomes:\n        *   Me: (6, 4), Enemy: (7, 6).\n        *   Distance = |6-7| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n        *   If the enemy (now at 7,6) moves DOWN next turn, it hits me at (6,4) -> Head-on collision (we both die).\n        *   If the enemy moves LEFT (to 6,6) or UP (to 7,7), we survive.\n        *   This is a moderate risk, but it puts me directly adjacent to an apple the enemy wants.\n    *   If I move **LEFT** to (5, 3):\n        *   I move away from the enemy.\n        *   The distance to the enemy increases.\n        *   It preserves the option to go Up towards the cluster of apples at (3,9), (0,4), (0,3) without immediate pressure.\n        *   It keeps the path to the right apple (9,1) open, but prioritizes safety first.\n    *   If I move **DOWN** to (6, 2):\n        *   I move towards the corner (bottom of the board).\n        *   This reduces future mobility.\n    *   Comparing UP (risk of collision) and LEFT (safety and positioning), LEFT is the superior choice. It moves me away from the immediate enemy interaction zone and toward the less contested left side.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving RIGHT is suicide. UP invites a dangerous clash over the (7,6) apple. DOWN limits options. LEFT is safe and strategic.\n\nLEFT",

The apple at (7, 6) was eaten last turn, so the enemy grew.\n        *   The enemy is likely hungry for the apple at (3, 9) or (3, 0).\n        *   If I move **UP (5, 4)**, I get closer to the (3, 9) apple but also closer to the enemy.\n        *   If I move **DOWN (5, 2)**, I move towards the (3, 0) apple and the bottom of the board.\n\n3.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    *   **Option UP (5, 4):** Moves towards the top-left apples ((3, 9), (0, 4), (0, 3)). However, this creates a potential conflict zone with Snake #1 who is also above me. Moving UP places my head directly below my own body segment at (6, 3), which is fine for this turn, but reduces safety margin.\n    *   **Option DOWN (5, 2):** Moves towards the bottom-left apples ((3, 0), (0, 0)). This area is currently less crowded. The enemy is at Y=6, and I am at Y=3. Moving DOWN increases the vertical distance from the enemy.\n    *   **Option LEFT (4, 3):** Sideways movement. Keeps me at Y=3, moving towards X=0. Safe, but doesn't optimize for reaching the closest apples (which are at Y=0 or Y=9).\n    *   **Option RIGHT (6, 3):** Death (hits own body).\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    *   Between **UP** and **DOWN**, **DOWN** is safer. It moves away from the enemy's current position and towards the less populated bottom-left corner. It keeps the path to (3, 0) open.\n    *   Between **DOWN** and **LEFT**, **DOWN** is better because it aligns with the goal of collecting apples (closest apple in that direction is (3, 0)).\n    *   Therefore, **DOWN** is the optimal move for safety and apple acquisition.\n\nLong-term plan: Secure the apples at the bottom of the board ((3,0), (0,0)) while maintaining distance from Snake #1. Avoid the top-right cluster where the enemy is active.\n\nDOWN",

This is the bottom row (y=1). If I move down, I will be at y=1. From there, I can go to (3, 0) or (9, 1). However, at y=1, I am on the edge of the board and the bottom row (y=0) is a dead end if I go down there without an escape plan.\n    *   **Option LEFT (4, 2):** Moves toward (3, 0) and left side apples. This keeps me at y=2, leaving the option to go down to y=1 or y=0 later. This provides better maneuverability than being on y=1.\n    *   **Option RIGHT (6, 2):** Moves toward (9, 1). This is a longer path to the nearest apples than going Left/Down. Also, moving right takes me closer to the enemy's column structure (x=7,8,9) at y=2. While the enemy is at y=7, staying on the left side is generally safer given the apple distribution.\n\n    *   **Decision:** Between **DOWN** and **LEFT**, **LEFT** is the superior move.\n        *   **LEFT** moves me toward the cluster of apples at (3, 0) and (0, 4).\n        *   **LEFT** keeps me at Y=2, preserving vertical flexibility (I can go DOWN to Y=1 next turn).\n        *   **DOWN** puts me at Y=1 immediately, which restricts movement (can't go to Y=0 then back to Y=1 easily) and offers no immediate proximity benefit over Left.\n\n    Therefore, **LEFT** is the optimal move for safety and approaching apples.\n\nLong-term plan: Move toward the bottom-left apple cluster ((3,0), (0,4)). Maintain distance from the enemy who is likely focusing on the top-left cluster. Keep options open by staying one row above the bottom row until the apple is adjacent.\n\nLEFT",

Immediate Safety Check:**\n- **UP (4, 3):** Current board shows (4, 3) is 'T' (Snake #1 body segment). **DEADLY.**\n- **LEFT (3, 2):** Current board shows (3, 2) is '.' (empty). **SAFE.**\n- **RIGHT (5, 2):** Current board shows (5, 2) is 'T' (My own body). Since I am moving, (5, 2) will be vacated. **DEADLY.**\n- **DOWN (4, 1):** Current board shows (4, 1) is '.'

Strategic Evaluation:**\n- **Available moves:** LEFT, DOWN.\n- **Goal:** Reach apples at (3, 0), (9, 1), (0, 4), (0, 3), (3, 9).\n- **Analysis of LEFT vs DOWN:**\n    - **LEFT (to 3, 2):** Moves me closer to apples (3, 0) and (0, 4). From (3, 2), I have access to (3, 1) or (2, 2), maintaining flexibility.\n    - **DOWN (to 4, 1):** Moves me closer to (3, 0) and (9, 1). From (4, 1), I am one step away from the bottom edge (y=0). While (4, 0) is currently empty, it is a potential dead end if apples don't spawn favorably or if the enemy cuts off the return path.\n- **Enemy Prediction:** Snake #1 is at (8, 7) and likely aiming for top apples (3, 9) or side apples (9, 1). They are far away, so immediate collision is unlikely.\n\n**3. Decision:**\nChoosing **LEFT** to (3, 2) is the optimal move. It keeps me one row above the bottom edge (y=0), preserving an extra row of maneuvering space compared to moving DOWN to y=1. It also positions me directly above the apple at (3, 0), ready to eat it on the following turn if it remains safe.\n\nMove towards the bottom-left apple cluster ((3,0), (0,4)). Keep distance from enemy in the top-right.\n\nLEFT",

All currently empty except (8,7) will be my neck next turn but empty after tail moves (tail at (9,6) moves to (8,6)? Let\u2019s trace: body is [(8,7),(7,7),(7,6),(8,6),(8,5),(9,5),(9,6)], tail at (9,6). If I move UP, tail stays at (9,6) unless I eat an apple. So (8,7) will be occupied by my second segment next turn. So DOWN next turn from (8,8) would be into my own body \u2192 risky. But other directions open.  \n- **RIGHT (9,7)**: next moves: UP (9,8), DOWN (9,6), LEFT (8,7), RIGHT off board \u2192 invalid. (9,6) is my body now but will be tail next turn? Actually, current tail is (9,6), so if I move RIGHT to (9,7), tail stays at (9,6) unless I eat. So DOWN from (9,7) next turn would be into my own body \u2192 unsafe. UP and LEFT would be safe.  \n\nBoth options reduce future moves slightly, but UP leaves more space (board center) while RIGHT corners me.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nApple at (9,1) is closest valuable target. Moving UP now allows me to later go DOWN the right column toward (9,1) after clearing my tail. Moving RIGHT now puts me at (9,7), then possibly forced DOWN into (9,6) next turn if no apple eaten \u2192 that\u2019s my own body then \u2192 dead. So RIGHT is risky for next turn unless I eat an apple this turn (but no apple at (9,7)).  \n\nBetter to go UP to (8,8), then next turn consider LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT to reposition toward (9,1) safely.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction**  \nEnemy likely moves toward apples (0,3)/(0,4) or (3,0) via LEFT or DOWN. That keeps enemy away from top-right where I\u2019m heading.  \n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nMove UP now to (8,8). Next turn, assess moving LEFT (7,8) or RIGHT (9,8) to stay flexible, then work down right side toward (9,1) once tail clears. Avoid getting pinned in top-right corner.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

Since Snake #1 moved on turn 27, this segment is occupied. **DEADLY.**\n- **DOWN (3, 1):** Checking board state. (3, 1) is '.' (empty). **SAFE.**\n- **LEFT (2, 2):** Checking board state. (2, 2) is '.' (empty). **SAFE.**\n- **RIGHT (4, 2):** This is the cell I just vacated (my previous head position). In Snake game rules, moving into the cell just vacated by your own head is safe because the body follows. However, standard strict logic checks usually against the *current* body list. My current body list includes (4, 2) as the first segment. Wait, the body list provided is ordered head-to-tail: `[(3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2)...]`. So (4, 2) is indeed the neck. Moving back into the neck is moving directly backwards, which is illegal and deadly. **DEADLY.**\n\n**3. Strategic Analysis of Safe Moves (DOWN vs LEFT):**\n- **Target Apples:** (3, 0), (0, 4), (0, 3), (9, 1), (3, 9).\n- **Option DOWN to (3, 1):**\n  - Moves closer to the apple at (3, 0).\n  - Puts me on the edge of the board (y=1, bottom is y=0).\n  - **Risk:** Being on the edge limits maneuverability. If the enemy moves to block (2, 1) or (4, 1) later, I might be forced to move to (3, 0) and get trapped.\n- **Option LEFT to (2, 2):**\n  - Moves towards apples at (0, 4) and (0, 3).\n  - Keeps me at y=2, maintaining a \"buffer\" row above the bottom edge (y=1 and y=0).\n  - This gives me more freedom to turn UP/DOWN later.\n  - **Risk:** None immediate.\n\n**4. Decision:**\nChoosing **LEFT** is safer for long-term survival. It avoids the bottom edge trap and keeps options open. The apple at (3, 0) will still be there next turn if I choose to go for it from (2, 2) -> (2, 1) -> (3, 0) or (2, 2) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 0) -> (3, 0).\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to (2, 2) to stay off the bottom edge and maintain flexibility.

Coordinates include (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3).\n\n**Move Evaluation**\n1.  **LEFT to (0, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** (0, 2) is within bounds (0-9) and currently empty ('.' on board row 2, col 0).\n    *   **Movement:** Moving from (1, 2) to (0, 2) is a valid move.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me closer to apples at (0, 3) and (0, 4). It also keeps me on the left wall, which limits attack angles from the left but reduces escape routes. However, with the enemy far away, this is the fastest path to the apples.\n\n2.  **UP to (1, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** The board shows 'A' at (0, 3) and 'T' at (2, 3) (my body). (1, 3) is an empty gap.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves towards the apple at (0, 3). However, it requires a subsequent turn to turn left or up to reach it. It's safer in terms of space but slower to the immediate apple.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (1, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** Empty.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves away from the cluster of apples at the top left. Generally bad unless escaping a trap.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** This is where my head was 1 turn ago. The board shows '0' at (1, 2) and 'T' at (2, 2) (which is actually my body segment). Moving back hits my own body. **DEADLY**.\n\n**Decision**\nThe apples at (0, 3) and (0, 4) are the closest targets. Moving **LEFT** directly approaches the apple at (0, 4) (since I can turn up immediately next turn). Moving to (0, 2) leaves me perfectly aligned to take the apple at (0, 3) on the next turn by moving UP. This is the most efficient path to securing points while the enemy is distant.\n\nLEFT",

I have an apple directly above at (0, 4) and an apple directly to the right at (1, 3) (based on the board state `0 . . . .` at row 3). Wait, looking at the provided board: `3 0 . . . . . . . A .`. The apple at (1,3) shown in the board matches the apples list `(3, 9), (0, 4), (9, 1), (3, 0), (8, 3)`. Let me re-verify the board drawing.\n    *   Row 3: `3 0 . . . . . . . A .`\n    *   Head at (0, 3) is the '0'.\n    *   The dots `.` are empty.\n    *   The 'A' is at (9, 3).\n    *   The apples list is `(3, 9), (0, 4), (9, 1), (3, 0), (8, 3)`.\n    *   The board drawing shows apples at `(3,9)`, `(0,4)`, `(3,0)`. It also shows an apple at `(9,3)` in the ASCII, but the list says `(9,1)` and `(8,3)`. There is a discrepancy between the ASCII board and the list. I should prioritize the list as it is explicitly stated data.\n    *   Looking closely at the board again: `3 0 . . . . . . . A .`. The A is at column 9. The list says (9,1) and (8,3). There is no (9,3) in the list. However, the ASCII board is the visual representation of the *current* state. The list is the set of available apples. It is possible the board drawing is slightly off or the apple locations are slightly different.\n    *   Let's look at the apple locations relative to my head (0,3):\n        *   (0, 4) is directly UP.\n        *   (0, 3) was just eaten (I am here now).\n        *   (3, 0) is DOWN and RIGHT.\n        *   (9, 1) is far RIGHT and DOWN.\n        *   (3, 9) is far RIGHT and UP.\n        *   (8, 3) is far RIGHT.\n    *   The most immediate apple is (0, 4).\n\n**Move Evaluation**\n1.  **UP to (0, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** (0, 4) is an apple. My head moves to (0, 4). My body is currently (0, 3) -> [(0, 2), (1, 2), ...]. I will not collide with myself.\n    *   **Enemy:** Snake #1 is at (5, 7), moving around.\n    *   **Strategy:** This collects an apple and grows my tail. It's the most valuable move.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (-1, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Out of bounds. **DEADLY**.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** (1, 3) is empty (dots on the board).\n    *   **Strategy:** Safe, but moves away from the apple at (0, 4). Suboptimal.\n\n4.  **DOWN to (0, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** (0, 2) is currently my body (the segment after my head).\n    *   **Analysis:** My body currently is `Head: (0, 3) -> Body: [(0, 2), ...]`. If I move DOWN, I move into (0, 2). This is the cell immediately behind my head. This counts as hitting myself. **DEADLY**.\n\n**Decision**\nMoving **UP** to (0, 4) is the only safe move that gains a point. It is the obvious optimal move.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating at (0, 4), I will be at the top of the left column. The available apples will be (3, 0), (9, 1), (3, 9), and (8, 3). I will need to navigate to the center/right side of the board to collect these. I must be careful of Snake #1, which is currently in the upper right quadrant. I should try to secure the apples on the left side before moving into the dangerous middle.\n\nUP",

Wait, my body after moving: head (5,6), neck (5,7)? No, body will be: head (5,6), then (5,7), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7)? Let\u2019s check: current body: (5,8),(6,8),(7,8),(8,8),(8,7),(7,7). If I move DOWN to (5,6), new body: head (5,6), then (5,7) old head, then (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7) \u2192 tail (7,7) will be removed next turn unless I eat an apple. No apple eaten this turn, so tail disappears next turn. So next turn\u2019s body: (5,6),(5,7),(5,8),(6,8),(7,8),(8,8),(8,7).  \n\nNext turn from (5,6):  \n- UP \u2192 (5,7): my own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,5): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,6): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,6): empty.  \nSafe next moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2192 3 options.  \n\n**LEFT to (4,7)**:  \nNew body: head (4,7), then (5,7),(5,8),(6,8),(7,8),(8,8),(8,7),(7,7) \u2192 tail (7,7) removed next turn.  \nNext turn from (4,7): body will be (4,7),(5,7),(5,8),(6,8),(7,8),(8,8),(8,7).  \n\nNext moves from (4,7):  \n- UP \u2192 (4,8): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,6): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,7): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,7): my own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \nSafe next moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT \u2192 3 options.  \n\n**RIGHT to (6,7)**:  \nNew body: head (6,7), then (5,7),(5,8),(6,8),(7,8),(8,8),(8,7),(7,7) \u2192 tail (7,7) removed next turn.  \nNext turn from (6,7): body (6,7),(5,7),(5,8),(6,8),(7,8),(8,8),(8,7).  \n\nNext moves from (6,7):  \n- UP \u2192 (6,8): my own body (segment 4? Let\u2019s check: body order: head (6,7), neck (5,7), then (5,8), then (6,8) is fourth segment) \u2192 unsafe (it\u2019s part of body).  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,6): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,7): my own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,7): empty? Wait, (7,7) currently in body but will be gone next turn because it\u2019s tail now. Yes, after move, tail (7,7) disappears next turn, so (7,7) will be empty next turn. So RIGHT is safe next turn.  \n\nSo from (6,7) next turn safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT \u2192 only 2 options, less mobility.  \n\nSo DOWN and LEFT give 3 safe moves next turn, RIGHT gives only 2 \u2192 avoid RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s likely move**  \nEnemy at (0,3) with apple at (0,4) above it. Likely goes UP to eat apple. That puts enemy at (0,4) next turn, far from me.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose between DOWN and LEFT**  \nLEFT gets me closer to apple (3,9), but that apple is near top edge \u2014 from (4,7) going to (3,9) requires UP+LEFT moves, could get constrained near top row.  \nDOWN keeps me central, good mobility, and I can aim for (8,3) or (9,1) later.  \n\nGiven my last move was DOWN, continuing DOWN might keep me in open area. But LEFT also has good mobility and gets me closer to an apple.  \n\nApple proximity favors LEFT slightly, but safety and future options equal. Let\u2019s check immediate danger: no difference.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose LEFT to make progress toward (3,9), but carefully in future turns to avoid top edge trap.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (4,7), next turn I\u2019ll have UP, DOWN, LEFT safe. Avoid going UP twice to prevent top-row trap. Maybe go LEFT next to (3,7) then UP toward (3,9) if safe. Keep enemy in mind \u2014 it will be longer if it eats (0,4).  \n\nLEFT",

Or (9, 1) is far.  \nEnemy might go UP to (0, 5) or RIGHT to (1, 4).  \nEither way, enemy is far from me now.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose between DOWN and LEFT**  \nLEFT gets me closer to (3, 9) and keeps mobility, but also moves toward left edge.  \nDOWN keeps central mobility and opens path to apples (8, 3) or (9, 1) later.  \nGiven my last move was LEFT (from (5,7) to (4,7)), continuing LEFT might corner me near left wall soon.  \nDOWN seems safer long-term \u2014 more space in middle.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (4, 6) next turn, I can go DOWN to (4, 5), LEFT to (3, 6), or RIGHT to (5, 6). That keeps options open for apples (8, 3) or (9, 1) later. Avoid trapping myself near top-left.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",

My body follows: `[(0, 4), (0, 3), ...]`. The tail is at `(4, 2)`.\n2.  **Immediate Moves:**\n    *   **UP (0, 6):** Valid and empty. Moves me closer to the `(3, 9)` apple.\n    *   **DOWN (0, 4):** **Invalid**. This is my previous head position and is now occupied by my own body. Moving down results in a collision.\n    *   **LEFT:** **Invalid**. Out of bounds.\n    *   **RIGHT (1, 5):** Valid and empty. Moves me inward.\n3.  **Enemy Snake #1 Analysis (Head at `(4, 6)`):**\n    *   The enemy head is at `(4, 6)`. My head is at `(0, 5)`. The vertical distance is 1 unit. If the enemy moves **LEFT** to `(3, 6)`, they will be two columns away. If the enemy moves **DOWN** to `(4, 5)`, they will be 4 columns away. They cannot reach my column `(x=0)` or my current `(y=5)` coordinate this turn.\n    *   *Crucial Observation:* The apple at `(8, 3)` is very close to the enemy's path and body. The enemy is likely to head towards it, especially since they have been moving generally downward/leftward recently.\n    *   *Opportunity:* The apple at `(3, 0)` is relatively safe. The enemy is currently at `y=6` and is far from `(3, 0)`. If I move **UP** now, I will be at `(0, 6)` and can begin a path down the left side towards `(3, 0)` while the enemy is distracted by the right-side apples.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI have two safe moves: UP and RIGHT. \n*   Moving **RIGHT** takes me into the open center of the board. While safe this turn, it increases the number of potential dangerous future moves and brings me closer to the enemy's territory.\n*   Moving **UP** keeps me on the edge (a safer location with fewer collision vectors). It also positions me to drop down the left edge in subsequent turns to reach the apple at `(3, 0)`. Since the enemy is likely heading towards the right-side apples, taking the left-side path avoids conflict.\n\nTherefore, I will move UP.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Based on the current board state and my previous move, I need to analyze the situation to determine the safest and most strategic move.\n\n**1. Update Analysis based on Last Move:**\n*   **Previous Move:** I chose UP. My head was at `(0, 5)`.\n*   **Simultaneous Movement:** In the standard Snake game format, opponents move at the same time as I do. My intended move is UP to `(0, 6)`. I must verify the safety of this target cell based on where the enemy *might* be.\n*   **Enemy Position (Turn 33):** Snake #1 Head is at `(3, 6)`.\n    *   **Potential Enemy Moves (Turn 34):**\n        *   **LEFT:** Head moves to `(2, 6)`. My target `(0, 6)` is safe.\n        *   **UP:** Head moves to `(3, 7)`. My target `(0, 6)` is safe.\n        *   **DOWN:** Head moves to `(3, 5)`. My target `(0, 6)` is safe.\n        *   **RIGHT:** Head moves to `(4, 6)`. My target `(0, 6)` is safe.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Regardless of where Snake #1 moves, they cannot occupy `(0, 6)` this turn. The minimum horizontal distance is 2 columns (if they move LEFT to `x=2`).\n\n**2. Current State (Turn 34):**\n*   **My Head:** Projected to `(0, 6)`.\n*   **My Body:** The tail is at `(4, 2)`. As I move UP to `(0, 6)`, my body shifts, but the tail does *not* move until the next turn (unless I eat an apple, which I am not adjacent to). So, my body occupies `[(0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2)]`.\n*   **Board State Reference:**\n    *   Row 6: `0 . . . 1 T . . . . .` (Based on the ASCII map, column 3 is '1' which is the enemy head. Wait, the map shows `1` at (3,6) which is the enemy head. The 'T' at (2,6) or (4,6) are not clearly marked in the map as enemy body, but the text says body is `[(4, 6), ...]`. So at turn 33, (4,6) is the body segment behind the head at (3,6)).\n    *   **Important Map Correction:** The map shows row 6 as `6 0 . . 1 T . . . . .`.\n        *   My head `0` is at (0,6).\n        *   Enemy head `1` is at (3,6).\n        *   Enemy body `T` is at (4,6).\n    *   **Apple at (3,9):** This is on row 9.\n\n**3. Move Evaluation (From Head at 0,6):**\n*   **UP to (0, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** Empty. The enemy is at y=6 (and potentially moving to y=7 or y=5). If they move UP to `(3,7)`, we are far apart.\n    *   **Strategy:** Keeps me on the left edge. Moves me closer to the apple at (3,9) but I am still very far.\n*   **DOWN to (0, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** This is my previous head position. It is now occupied by my body (specifically the segment at (0,5)). **DEADLY**.\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Currently empty. However, Snake #1 is at (3,6). If Snake #1 moves LEFT to (2,6), we are side-by-side. If Snake #1 moves LEFT *and* I move RIGHT, we don't collide this turn.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moves me towards the center. This brings me closer to the apple at (8,3) and (3,9), but also closer to the enemy.\n*   **LEFT to (-1, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** Out of bounds. **DEADLY**.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision:**\n*   **Option A (UP):** I am at `(0, 6)`. Moving UP puts me at `(0, 7)`. This is a safe edge move. I am currently losing 7 to 6. I need to find apples. The apple at `(3, 0)` is reachable if I go DOWN later. The apple at `(3, 9)` is a long-term goal.\n*   **Option B (RIGHT):** Moving RIGHT to `(1, 6)` gets me off the absolute edge. It gives me more flexibility. However, the enemy is to the right.\n*   **Enemy Prediction:** The enemy has 6 apples. They are likely chasing the cluster of apples on the right side of the board (specifically `(8,3)` and `(9,1)`).\n*   **Plan:** I will stick to the left side to avoid the enemy. The enemy is moving towards the right/center. I should continue moving UP towards the apple at `(3, 9)` or prepare to sweep down the left side for `(3, 0)`. Moving UP keeps me safe from the enemy who is at `x=3`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving UP to `(0, 7)` is the safest move. It avoids my own body (which stretches down to y=2) and avoids the enemy (who is at x=3). It aligns with the previous strategy of staying on the edge while the enemy occupies the center.\n\nUP",

My body follows below, occupying `(0, 6)` down to `(0, 2)` and then across to `(2, 2)`.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 is at `(3, 7)` with its body extending to the right and up.\n*   **Board Geometry:** I am on the left edge ($x=0$). The enemy is in the center column ($x=3$). The space between us (columns 1 and 2) is currently empty.\n\n**Move Evaluation (from Head `(0, 7)`):**\n1.  **LEFT:** Moves to `(-1, 7)`. This is outside the board boundaries (0-9). **DEADLY.**\n2.  **UP:** Moves to `(0, 8)`.\n    *   **Safety:** The cell is empty. The enemy is at `y=7`, so they cannot reach `y=8` this turn (since they are 3 units away horizontally and can only move 1 step).\n    *   **Body:** My body is at `(0, 6)`. No collision.\n    *   **Strategy:** This is a safe move that keeps me on the edge. However, it takes me towards the top-left corner, which limits my future movement options compared to moving into the open column 1.\n3.  **DOWN:** Moves to `(0, 6)`.\n    *   **Safety:** This cell contains my body segment (the one immediately behind my head). Moving here is considered suicide. **DEADLY.**\n4.  **RIGHT:** Moves to `(1, 7)`.\n    *   **Safety:** The cell is empty. My body is at `(0, 6)` and below. The enemy is at `(3, 7)`. The distance to the enemy head is 2 columns. Even if the enemy moves LEFT to `(2, 7)`, we will not collide (they at `x=2`, me at `x=1`). We could potentially move into adjacent cells, but not the same cell.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moving RIGHT is highly advantageous. It opens up the board for me. It positions me to potentially access apples in the future (like the one at `(3,9)` or `(8,3)`) without being immediately cornered. It also keeps me away from the wall, giving me more maneuverability.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nThe only safe moves are **UP** and **RIGHT**.\n*   Moving **UP** traps me against the top wall eventually, with only one column of maneuvering room ($x=0$ and $x=1$).\n*   Moving **RIGHT** gives me access to column 1 (and potentially more), creating a safe zone between me and the enemy (who is at column 3). This significantly increases my survival odds and ability to navigate the board later.\n\nTherefore, **RIGHT** is the superior move.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Secure space in column 1. Monitor enemy movement. If the enemy moves away to the right, I can continue expanding into the board. If the enemy holds at column 3 or moves left, I can retreat to the edge.\n\nRIGHT",

Body is at `(0, 7)` and extends down to `(0, 2)` and across to `(2, 2)`.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 is at `(3, 8)` (Head) with body at `(3, 7)`.\n*   **Apples:** Closest is at `(3, 9)`. Others are at `(9, 1)`, `(3, 0)`, `(8, 3)`, `(7, 0)`.\n\n**Move Evaluation from Head `(1, 7)`:**\n1.  **LEFT:** Moves to `(0, 7)`.\n    *   **Analysis:** This cell is currently occupied by my own body (the segment immediately behind my head from turn 35).\n    *   **Result:** **DEADLY** (Suicide).\n2.  **DOWN:** Moves to `(1, 6)`.\n    *   **Analysis:** The cell `(1, 6)` appears empty on the board. However, I need to consider the enemy's possible moves. The enemy head is at `(3, 8)`. If the enemy moves **LEFT**, they go to `(2, 8)`. If they move **DOWN**, they go to `(3, 7)`. `LEFT` is the most dangerous potential move for a head-on collision because if I go DOWN to `(1, 6)` and they go LEFT to `(2, 6)`, we are safe. Wait, let's check `(1, 6)`.\n    *   Let's check adjacency. If I am at `(1, 6)`, I need to avoid the enemy head if it ends up at `(1, 6)` or adjacent cells if I want to be safe, but collision only happens on the *same* cell.\n    *   Can the enemy reach `(1, 6)` this turn? `(3, 8)` -> `(1, 6)` requires moving 2 steps Left and 2 steps Down. Snakes move 1 step per turn. So the enemy cannot reach `(1, 6)`.\n    *   Can the enemy reach `(1, 7)`? No, they are at `(3, 8)`.\n    *   So `DOWN` to `(1, 6)` seems physically safe from collision *this turn*. But let's look at the board.\n    *   Wait, looking at the previous turn's board state provided in the prompt: \"7 T 0 . T T T . . . .\" (Turn 35). My head was at `(0,7)`.\n    *   My move was `RIGHT` to `(1, 7)`.\n    *   Enemy was at `(3, 8)`. They could move `LEFT` to `(2, 8)` or `DOWN` to `(3, 7)`.\n    *   Let's check `DOWN` to `(1, 6)`.\n        *   Is `(1, 6)` safe? Yes.\n        *   Does it open up options? Yes.\n    *   However, I should consider `UP`. `UP` to `(1, 8)`.\n        *   Is `(1, 8)` safe?\n        *   Enemy at `(3, 8)` moving `LEFT` to `(2, 8)` would be adjacent. Moving `LEFT` twice isn't possible.\n        *   If enemy moves `LEFT` to `(2, 8)`, I am at `(1, 8)`. No collision.\n        *   If enemy moves `DOWN` to `(3, 7)`, I am at `(1, 8)`. No collision.\n        *   So `UP` is safe.\n    *   What about `RIGHT`? `RIGHT` to `(2, 7)`.\n        *   The previous turn board showed `(2, 7)` was empty.\n        *   However, the enemy body occupies `(3, 7)`.\n        *   If the enemy moves `DOWN` to `(3, 7)`, they might die if their body is there? No, tails move.\n        *   Let's look at enemy body: `[(3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8)]`.\n        *   If enemy moves `DOWN` (to `(3, 7)`), their old tail `(5, 8)` leaves. The body becomes `[(3, 7), (3, 7) (old head), ...]`.\n        *   If enemy moves `LEFT` (to `(2, 8)`), `(3, 7)` becomes empty (it was the neck).\n        *   So `(2, 7)` is safe regardless of which direction the enemy moves, as long as they don't move to `(2, 7)`.\n        *   Can they move to `(2, 7)`? `(3, 8)` -> `(2, 7)` is a diagonal move (Left + Down). Snakes cannot move diagonally.\n        *   So `RIGHT` to `(2, 7)` is safe.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI am at `(1, 7)`.\n*   `LEFT` is death.\n*   `DOWN` to `(1, 6)` puts me into the open space. It's safe.\n*   `UP` to `(1, 8)` puts me near the top wall.\n*   `RIGHT` to `(2, 7)` is the key move. It brings me closer to the center, closer to the apple at `(3, 9)` (since `x` is increasing), and opens up the board.\n\nLet's verify `RIGHT` to `(2, 7)` safety specifically.\n*   Enemy head at `(3, 8)`.\n*   Can enemy reach `(2, 7)`? No (Diagonal).\n*   Can enemy reach `(2, 7)` if they move? No.\n*   Is `(2, 7)` occupied by enemy body? Yes, `(3, 7)` is in the enemy body list provided.\n    *   Wait. If I move to `(2, 7)`, and `(3, 7)` is the enemy's second segment (neck), is that a collision?\n    *   The rule is: \"If your head moves into any snake's body... you die.\"\n    *   The enemy body list given is from the start of the turn: `[(3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8)]`.\n    *   `(2, 7)` is NOT in this list. `(3, 7)` is.\n    *   So `RIGHT` to `(2, 7)` is safe.\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   `DOWN` to `(1, 6)`: Safe, but stays relatively close to my tail.\n*   `RIGHT` to `(2, 7)`: Safe, moves toward the center, increases movement freedom, and approaches the apple at `(3, 9)`.\n\nI will choose `RIGHT`.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move into column 2 to open up movement options. Watch for enemy moves toward column 2. Aim for the apple at (3,9) or (8,3) depending on enemy behavior.\n\nRIGHT",

In my `UP` move to `(2, 8)`, I moved directly towards that potential threat. Since the enemy snake was 7 segments long and the board state shows the enemy at `(3, 8)` with a specific body configuration, let's verify the safety of my new position `(2, 8)`.\n\nCurrent State Analysis (Turn 38):\n- My Head: `(2, 8)`\n- My Body: `[(2, 7), (1, 7), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2)]` (Tail at `(0, 2)`)\n- Enemy Head: `(3, 9)` (moved from `(3, 8)` by `UP` - assuming they continued towards `(9, 1)` or just foraging)\n- Enemy Body: `[(3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8)]`\n- Board State `(9, 9)` to `(0, 0)`:\n  - Row 9: `. . . 1 . . . . . .`\n  - Row 8: `. . . T . T . . . .`\n  - Row 7: `. . 0 T . T . . . .`\n  - Row 6: `. . . T T . . . . .`\n  - Row 5: `. . . . . . . . . .`\n  - Row 4: `. . . . . . . . . .`\n  - Row 3: `. . . . . . . . A .`\n  - Row 2: `. . . . . . . . . .`\n  - Row 1: `. A . . . . . . . A`\n  - Row 0: `. . . A . . . A . .`\n  - Cols: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Turn: 37 / 150\" and \"My last move... RIGHT\" (which was turn 37). So I am now at the start of Turn 38. The board state provided reflects the situation *before* I moved (or immediately after, showing my move?).\n\nLet's re-read the prompt carefully. \"Your last move information... START LAST MOVE PICK RIGHT... END LAST MOVE PICK\". This implies I *already moved* `RIGHT` (to `(2, 7)` from `(1, 7)`) in turn 37. But the \"Your snake\" section says \"Head: (2, 7)\". Correct.\n\nWait, I need to check the \"Board state\" provided.\nRow 7: `T T 0 T T T . . . .`\nHead is `(2, 7)` (0 is there). Enemy body at `(3, 7)` (T is there). `(1, 7)` is T. `(0, 7)` is T. This matches my current state *before* I make the decision for Turn 38.\n\nHowever, the \"Your last move information\" section says \"Based on the board state... I am now at `(1, 7)`\". This is contradictory. The Board State shows 0 at `(2, 7)`. The \"Your snake\" section says Head `(2, 7)`. The \"START LAST RATIONALE\" talks about being at `(1, 7)` and moving `RIGHT`. This is likely a parsing artifact where the \"Last Rationale\" is for Turn 37, but the \"Board State\" and \"Your Snake\" are for the start of Turn 38.\n\nActually, looking at the \"Board State\" provided in the prompt:\nRow 8: ` . . . 1 . T . . . .` -> Wait, looking at the text: \"8 . . . T . T . . . .\"\nRow 7: \"7 T T 0 T T T . . . .\"\nRow 9: \"9 . . . 1 . . . . . .\"\n\nWait, \"Snake #1 - Head: (3, 9)\".\nIn the board state, `(3, 9)` is `1`. Correct.\nMy Head `(2, 7)` is `0`. Correct.\n\nSo, I am at `(2, 7)` starting Turn 38.\nEnemy is at `(3, 9)` starting Turn 38.\nEnemy body includes `(3, 8)`. Correct.\nEnemy body includes `(3, 7)`. Correct.\n\nPotential moves from `(2, 7)`:\n- **UP**: `(2, 8)`. Is it free? Board row 8: `.` at `(2, 8)`. Safe.\n- **DOWN**: `(2, 6)`. Is it free? Board row 6: `.` at `(2, 6)`. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: `(1, 7)`. Is it free? Board row 7: `T` at `(1, 7)`. This is my body. UNSAFE.\n- **RIGHT**: `(3, 7)`. Is it free? Board row 7: `T` at `(3, 7)`. This is Enemy body. UNSAFE.\n\nSo `UP` and `DOWN` are safe moves.\nStrategy:\n- `UP` to `(2, 8)` moves towards the apple at `(3, 9)`. It also puts me closer to the enemy head `(3, 9)`. Distance: 1 step (Manhattan).\n- `DOWN` to `(2, 6)` moves away from the enemy and the apple at `(3, 9)`.\n\nIs moving `UP` to `(2, 8)` dangerous?\nIf I move `UP` to `(2, 8)`:\nMy new head: `(2, 8)`.\nEnemy is at `(3, 9)`.\nIf enemy moves `LEFT` to `(2, 9)`, we are safe (distance 1).\nIf enemy moves `DOWN` to `(3, 8)`, we are safe.\nIf enemy moves `LEFT` to `(2, 9)`, I am at `(2, 8)`. No collision.\nCan the enemy reach `(2, 8)`?\nFrom `(3, 9)`, the only moves are `(2, 9)`, `(3, 8)`, `(4, 9)`.\nThey cannot move diagonally to `(2, 8)`. They cannot move to `(2, 8)` directly because `(3, 9)` to `(2, 8)` is diagonal (Left + Down).\nSo `(2, 8)` is safe from head-on collision with the enemy at `(3, 9)`.\n\nHowever, I must also consider that the enemy might have moved in Turn 37.\nWait, I am making the move for Turn 38. The board state reflects the start of Turn 38. The enemy at `(3, 9)` is the result of *their* Turn 37 move (likely `UP` from `(3, 8)`). So they are settled at `(3, 9)`.\n\nIf I go `UP` to `(2, 8)`:\n- I am one step closer to the apple at `(3, 9)`.\n- I am one step away from the enemy head.\n- The enemy body occupies `(3, 8)` and `(3, 7)`.\n- If I go to `(2, 8)`, I am adjacent to `(3, 8)`. If I were to move `RIGHT` next turn, I would hit the enemy body if it stays there (unlikely, tails move). But collision only happens if head enters body.\n\nLet's check `DOWN` to `(2, 6)`.\n- It opens up the bottom of the board.\n- But I am moving away from the apple at `(3, 9)` which is only 2 moves away currently (Manhattan distance 2 from `(2, 7)`). If I go `UP`, it becomes 1.\n- The apple at `(3, 9)` is very close. I should take it if safe.\n\nIs there any risk in `UP`?\nIf enemy moves `LEFT` (to `(2, 9)`), I am at `(2, 8)`. Safe.\nIf enemy moves `DOWN` (to `(3, 8)`), I am at `(2, 8)`. Safe.\nIf enemy moves `RIGHT` (to `(4, 9)`), I am at `(2, 8)`. Safe.\n\nWhat if I go `DOWN`?\nIf I go `DOWN` to `(2, 6)`, I am safe. But I lose the chance to eat the apple at `(3, 9)` quickly. The enemy is at `(3, 9)`. They might eat it. If they eat it, they grow. If they grow, their tail (currently at `(5, 8)`) stays. If they don't eat, the apple stays.\nThe prompt says \"Apples at: ... (9, 1), (3, 0), (8, 3), (7, 0), (1, 1)\". Wait, where is (3,9)? Ah, the \"Board state\" shows `. . . 1 . . . . . .` on row 9. The 1 is at column 3. So apple is at `(3, 9)`. Yes.\nWait, the prompt lists \"Apples at: (9, 1), (3, 0), (8, 3), (7, 0), (1, 1)\". This list seems to exclude `(3, 9)` seen in the board state.\nLet's look at the board state row 9: \"9 . . . 1 . . . . . .\"\nThis is column 3. So there is an apple at `(3, 9)`.\nThe list provided might be old or incomplete? Or perhaps it's a typo in the prompt?\nActually, looking at the board state provided, it is the source of truth for positions.\nRow 9 has `1` at col 3. So apple at `(3, 9)`.\nRow 3 has `A` at col 8. So apple at `(8, 3)`.\nRow 1 has `A` at col 1 and col 9. So `(1, 1)` and `(9, 1)`.\nRow 0 has `A` at col 3 and col 7. So `(3, 0)` and `(7, 0)`.\nThe list matches the board state. `(3, 9)` is NOT in the list.\nWait, the list is: `(9, 1), (3, 0), (8, 3), (7, 0), (1, 1)`.\nLet's re-read the board state carefully.\nRow 9: ` . . . 1 . . . . . .`\nIs that `1` an apple or the enemy head?\n\"Enemy snakes: Snake #1 - Head: (3, 9)\"\nSo `(3, 9)` is the enemy head. The `1` in the board state represents the enemy head, NOT an apple.\nMy apologies. I misread the board state visualization. `1` is Snake #1. `0` is me. `T` is my body. `A` is apple.\nSo there is NO apple at `(3, 9)`. The enemy is there.\n\nOkay, let's re-evaluate based on correct apple positions:\nApples: `(9, 1)`, `(3, 0)`, `(8, 3)`, `(7, 0)`, `(1, 1)`.\nMy position: `(2, 7)`.\n\nClosest apples?\n- `(1, 1)`: Distance (Manhattan) = `|1-2| + |1-7| = 1 + 6 = 7`. Down and Left.\n- `(3, 0)`: Distance = `|3-2| + |0-7| = 1 + 7 = 8`. Down and Right.\n- `(9, 1)`: Distance = `|9-2| + |1-7| = 7 + 6 = 13`.\n- `(8, 3)`: Distance = `|8-2| + |3-7| = 6 + 4 = 10`.\n- `(7, 0)`: Distance = `|7-2| + |0-7| = 5 + 7 = 12`.\n\nThe closest apple is `(1, 1)` (7 moves) and `(3, 0)` (8 moves).\n`(1, 1)` is located at column 1, row 1.\nMy body occupies `(0, 7)` down to `(0, 2)` and `(1, 7)`.\n`(1, 1)` is currently free.\nTo get to `(1, 1)`, I need to go DOWN and LEFT.\nFrom `(2, 7)`, I can go `LEFT` to `(1, 7)`. But `(1, 7)` is my body (occupied). So `LEFT` is impossible directly.\nI can go `DOWN` to `(2, 6)`.\nFrom `(2, 6)`, I can go `LEFT` to `(1, 6)`.\nFrom `(1, 6)`, I can go `DOWN` to `(1, 5)`.\n...\nFrom `(1, 2)`, I can go `DOWN` to `(1, 1)`.\nThis path is: `DOWN` -> `LEFT` -> `DOWN` x4.\n\nLet's look at the path to `(3, 0)`.\nFrom `(2, 7)`:\n`DOWN` -> `(2, 6)`\n`DOWN` -> `(2, 5)`\n...\n`DOWN` -> `(2, 1)`\n`DOWN` -> `(2, 0)`\n`RIGHT` -> `(3, 0)`\nThis is 7 moves down, 1 right. 8 moves total.\n\nAre there any obstacles?\nMy body is in column 0 mostly. Column 1 is clear below row 7 (where `(1, 7)` is). `(1, 6)` is empty (row 6 has `.` at col 1). `(1, 5)` is empty. etc.\nSo going `DOWN` towards `(1, 1)` or `(3, 0)` seems feasible.\n\nNow, let's look at the enemy.\nSnake #1 at `(3, 9)`. Body: `[(3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8)]`.\nThe enemy is in column 3. They are stacked vertically at `x=3`.\nThey are near the apple at `(8, 3)` (which is far) and `(9, 1)` (far).\nThey might be coming down or hunting apples elsewhere.\n\nLet's check safety of `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` from `(2, 7)`.\n- **LEFT**: `(1, 7)`. Board says `T`. (My body). Unsafe.\n- **RIGHT**: `(3, 7)`. Board says `T`. (Enemy body part at `(3, 7)`). Unsafe.\n- **UP**: `(2, 8)`. Board says `.`. Safe.\n- **DOWN**: `(2, 6)`. Board says `.`. Safe.\n\nSo choices are `UP` or `DOWN`.\n`UP` moves towards the top right corner.\n`DOWN` moves towards the center/apples.\n\nIf I go `UP` to `(2, 8)`:\n- I am closer to `(3, 9)` (enemy head). Distance 2.\n- Enemy is at `(3, 9)`. If they move `LEFT` to `(2, 9)`, I am at `(2, 8)`. Safe.\n- If they move `DOWN` to `(3, 8)`, I am at `(2, 8)`. Safe.\n- `UP` puts me in a potentially enclosed area? Top wall is at y=9. Right wall at x=9.\n- I am at `(2, 8)`. Top left is relatively open.\n- However, my tail is at `(0, 2)`. To eat apples, I need to go down.\n- Going `UP` seems like a detour if the apples are at `(1, 1)` and `(3, 0)`.\n\nIf I go `DOWN` to `(2, 6)`:\n- I am moving towards apples.\n- I am moving away from the enemy at `(3, 9)`.\n- `(2, 6)` is free.\n- From `(2, 6)`, I can go `LEFT` (to `(1, 6)`) or `DOWN` (to `(2, 5)`) or `RIGHT` (to `(3, 6)`).\n- `(3, 6)` is part of the enemy body (from the list: `..., (3, 6), ...`). So `RIGHT` is blocked by the enemy body if it remains, but tails move.\n- If I go `DOWN` to `(2, 6)`, I open up the path to `(1, 1)`.\n\nComparing `UP` vs `DOWN`:\n- `UP`: Moves away from the nearest apples. Increases distance to `(1, 1)` to 8. Increases distance to `(3, 0)` to 9. Might be safe from immediate enemy contact, but puts me in a corner if the enemy decides to sweep down.\n- `DOWN`: Moves towards the nearest apples. Decreases distance to `(1, 1)` to 6. Decreases distance to `(3, 0)` to 7. Moves away from the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at `(3, 9)`. They are hunting apples. The apples at `(9, 1)` and `(8, 3)` are far from them, but so are `(1, 1)` and `(3, 0)` from me.\nWait, the enemy has 7 apples. I have 7 apples. It's a tie.\nThe game goes to 150 turns (currently 37). Plenty of time.\nBut usually, you want to secure points.\n`(1, 1)` is 7 moves away.\n`(3, 0)` is 8 moves away.\n\nIf I go `DOWN` to `(2, 6)`:\nNext turn I can go `LEFT` to `(1, 6)`. Then `DOWN` to `(1, 5)`, etc.\nThis path is clear of my body (my body is in col 0, row 2-7, plus `(1, 7)`.\n`(1, 6)` is free. `(1, 5)` free. `(1, 4)` free. `(1, 3)` free. `(1, 2)` free. `(1, 1)` apple.\nThis looks like a very safe route to an apple.\nI can eat `(1, 1)` and then go for `(3, 0)` (which is right next to it, but below).\n\nIf I go `UP`:\nI go to `(2, 8)`. Then maybe `(2, 9)`? Wall.\nThen I have to go `RIGHT`. `(3, 9)` is enemy. `(4, 9)` wall? No, `(9, 9)` is corner.\nActually `(9, 9)` is top right. `(2, 9)` is open.\nBut from there, I have to navigate around.\nThe enemy is at `(3, 9)`. If I go `(2, 9)`, I am adjacent.\nIf the enemy moves `LEFT` to `(2, 9)`, I die if I am there.\nSo being at `(2, 8)` puts me in a position where if the enemy moves `LEFT` (to `x=2`), I might be in danger if I move to `(2, 9)`.\nBut staying at `(2, 8)` and moving `RIGHT` to `(3, 8)` is death because `(3, 8)` is enemy body.\nSo `UP` limits my movement options significantly (basically only `RIGHT` or `LEFT` or `UP`).\n`DOWN` gives me `DOWN` and `LEFT` and potentially `RIGHT`.\n\nThe \"Openness\" score:\n`UP`: `.` at `(2, 8)`. `.` at `(2, 9)`. `.` at `(3, 8)`. `T` at `(3, 7)`. `.` at `(1, 8)`.\n`DOWN`: `.` at `(2, 6)`. `.` at `(2, 5)`. `.` at `(1, 6)`. `.` at `(3, 6)`.\n\nIs `(1, 7)` safe? No, it's my body. `LEFT` is blocked.\nIs `(3, 7)` safe? No, enemy body. `RIGHT` is blocked.\nSo I must go `UP` or `DOWN`.\n\nI will choose `DOWN`. It moves me towards the closest apple `(1, 1)` which is a safe path.\nMy current body blocks `(1, 7)`. My tail is at `(0, 2)`.\nThe path to `(1, 1)` is `(2, 7)` -> `(2, 6)` -> `(1, 6)` -> `(1, 5)` -> `(1, 4)` -> `(1, 3)` -> `(1, 2)` -> `(1, 1)`.\nThis requires 7 moves.\nI will go `DOWN` to start this path.\n\nFinal check:\nEnemy at `(3, 9)`. Can they reach `(2, 6)` this turn? No.\nCan they reach `(2, 7)`? No.\nCan they reach `(3, 7)`? They are at `(3, 9)`. `DOWN` -> `(3, 8)`. `DOWN` -> `(3, 7)`. Yes, 2 moves. Not this turn.\nSo `(2, 6)` is safe.\n\nDecision: `DOWN`.\n\nDOWN",

The board shows apples at `(3, 0)`, `(1, 1)`, `(8, 3)`, `(9, 1)`, and `(7, 0)`.\n\nLet's evaluate the moves:\n1.  **UP to (2, 6)**: The cell `(2, 6)` is currently occupied by my body (specifically the segment `(2, 6)` from the list `[(2, 6), (2, 7), ...]`). Moving here would be a collision with my own body.\n2.  **LEFT to (1, 5)**: The cell `(1, 5)` is currently empty (according to the board map, row 5 has `T` at `x=0`, `0` at `x=2`, and dots elsewhere). This is a valid move.\n3.  **RIGHT to (3, 5)**: The cell `(3, 5)` is currently empty. This is a valid move.\n4.  **DOWN to (2, 4)**: The cell `(2, 4)` is currently empty. This is a valid move.\n\nAll moves except UP are safe immediately. I need to choose the best move to increase my score.\n\n*   Moving **DOWN** to `(2, 4)` moves toward the bottom left corner. The nearest apples in that direction are `(3, 0)` and `(1, 1)`. However, I am currently at `y=5`, and the apples are at `y=0` and `y=1`. The distance is significant, and moving down pushes me away from the other apples on the board like `(8, 3)` and `(9, 1)`.\n*   Moving **LEFT** to `(1, 5)` moves me closer to the apples at `(1, 1)` and `(3, 0)`. From `(1, 5)`, I can start descending toward the cluster of apples at the bottom. This also keeps me away from the enemy snake, whose head is at `(5, 9)` (top right).\n*   Moving **RIGHT** to `(3, 5)` moves me slightly closer to the apple at `(8, 3)`. However, it also moves me away from the closer apples at `(3, 0)` and `(1, 1)`. Additionally, the path to the right seems potentially more crowded or complex than the path to the left which seems largely open.\n\nComparing **LEFT** and **DOWN**: LEFT `(1, 5)` positions me directly above the apple at `(1, 1)` (2 steps away in Y, 0 in X), whereas DOWN `(2, 4)` is 4 steps away in Y from `(3, 0)` (plus some X movement). LEFT is the immediate direction of the closest apple cluster.\n\nComparing **LEFT** and **RIGHT**: LEFT is the direction of the closest apples (bottom left quadrant). RIGHT is the direction of the more distant apples (top right). Since my score is tied with the enemy (7-7), securing the closest apples quickly is a priority.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the optimal move to target the nearest apples at `(1, 1)` and `(3, 0)` while keeping a safe open path and avoiding the enemy.\n\nLong-term plan: Head towards the apple at `(1, 1)` via `(1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2)`, then collect `(3, 0)`. This clears the bottom left corner and avoids the enemy at the top.\n\nLEFT",

Actually (4,8) to (8,3) = |4|+|5|=9, same as from (5,8).  \n- RIGHT to (6,8): closer to (8,3) distance 7.  \n\nRIGHT is best for nearest apple (8,3).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility**  \n\n**DOWN to (5,7)**:  \nFrom (5,7): UP=(5,8) my body, DOWN=(5,6) empty, LEFT=(4,7) empty, RIGHT=(6,7) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n**LEFT to (4,8)**:  \nFrom (4,8): UP=(4,9) my body, DOWN=(4,7) empty, LEFT=(3,8) my body, RIGHT=(5,8) my body \u2192 only 1 safe move (DOWN) \u2192 dangerous.  \n\n**RIGHT to (6,8)**:  \nFrom (6,8): UP=(6,9) empty, DOWN=(6,7) empty, LEFT=(5,8) my body, RIGHT=(7,8) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nSo LEFT is bad (traps me).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nEnemy is on left side far away. I want to avoid trapping myself while moving toward apples. RIGHT goes toward (8,3) and keeps good mobility. DOWN also good mobility but slightly farther from apples.  \n\nRIGHT seems slightly better because (8,3) is reachable in a few moves without boxing myself in.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,8), I can go DOWN toward apples at (7,0) or (8,3) while staying flexible.
