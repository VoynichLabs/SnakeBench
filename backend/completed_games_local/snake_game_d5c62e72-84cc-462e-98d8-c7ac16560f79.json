Avoid edge pinning (e.g., moving RIGHT to x=9 limits future moves) and keep tabs on the (4,6) apple as a secondary target if (7,9) becomes unreachable.\n\n### Move Evaluation\n1. **LEFT**: Moves head to (7,6), which is my own tail (part of my body)\u2014immediately deadly; eliminated.\n2. **UP**: Moves head to (8,7). Safe check: On-board (x=8, y=7 are within 0-9), no collision with my body [(7,6)] or Snake #1\u2019s body [(1,7)]. Follow-up flexibility: From (8,7), future safe moves would include UP (8,8), LEFT (7,7), and RIGHT (9,7) (3 options) after my tail drops (7,6). This move also brings me closer to the reachable (7,9) apple.\n3. **DOWN**: Moves head to (8,5). Safe but offers no immediate apple progress (only distant (8,0) apple) and equal follow-up flexibility (3 options) to UP\u2014lower priority due to lack of score potential.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moves head to (9,6). Safe but pins me to the x=9 edge, reducing follow-up flexibility to 2 options (UP, DOWN) and no immediate apple progress\u2014lowest priority.\n\nNo likely head-on collisions with Snake #1 (its possible moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, none targeting my safe move positions). Among safe moves, UP best balances apple proximity and future options.\nUP",

Eliminated.\n- **DOWN**: New head (7,6) \u2192 valid coordinates, not in own/enemy body, no backward move. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: New head (6,7) \u2192 valid coordinates, not in own/enemy body, no backward move. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: New head (8,7) \u2192 valid coordinates, not in own/enemy body, no backward move. Safe.\n\nNext, I rank remaining safe moves by the objective criteria (future options, apple proximity, collision avoidance):\n1. **DOWN**: Moves head to (7,6), far from the nearest accessible apple (7,9) and closer to the enemy\u2019s general area (4,5). Limits future upward access to the (7,9) apple until the tail shifts.\n2. **RIGHT**: Moves head to (8,7), with no immediate apple nearby and risk of trapping against the x=9 wall later. No clear benefit.\n3. **LEFT**: Moves head to (6,7), which opens lateral movement to let my tail (currently (7,8)) follow (tail will shift to (7,7) next turn, freeing (7,8)). This sets up future access to the (7,9) apple (once the tail clears the path) and keeps multiple follow-up moves open (up to (6,8), down to (6,6), left to (5,7)). Avoids enemy proximity and tight spaces.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Future Turns\n1. Continue lateral (leftward) movement for 1-2 turns to let the tail shift away from (7,8), freeing the upward path to the (7,9) apple.\n2. Once the tail clears (7,8), prioritize moving up to safely collect the (7,9) apple.\n3. Avoid the enemy\u2019s area (around (4,5)) until their tail shifts and collision risk decreases.\n4. Monitor the enemy\u2019s movement to avoid head-on collisions in shared grid regions.\n\nLEFT",

This is a collision, so it's invalid.\n- **UP**: Head moves to (3,6). Check safety: (3,6) is on the board, not in my body (body is (3,5), (4,5)), and not in enemy snake #0's body (snake #0 is at (6,7), (7,7)). Safe.\n- **DOWN**: Head moves to (3,4). Safe (on the board, not in my body or enemy body).\n- **LEFT**: Head moves to (2,5). Safe (on the board, not in my body or enemy body).\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Moves for Apple Proximity\n- **UP** moves towards the apple at (4,6) (Manhattan distance 2 from (3,5) \u2192 1 from (3,6)).\n- **DOWN** moves away from the closest apple (4,6) and towards (4,2) (distance 4 from (3,5) \u2192 3 from (3,4)).\n- **LEFT** moves away from all apples (e.g., (4,6) is 7 distance from (2,5)).\n\n### Step 3: Check Future Options\n- Moving **UP** to (3,6) leaves more future options: next move could be right to (4,6) (the apple), up to (3,7), or left to (2,6), avoiding tight spaces.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (3,4) limits future options (right is safe, but down/left may lead to tighter spaces).\n- Moving **LEFT** to (2,5) moves away from all apples and limits direction to up/down/left (no right).\n\n### Step 4: Avoid Head-on Collisions\nEnemy snake #0 is at (6,7). Moving **UP** to (3,6) is far from the enemy, so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n### Conclusion\n**UP** is the best move: it keeps me safe, moves towards the closest apple, and leaves open future options.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n- **DOWN**: New head (6,6) \u2192 Valid coordinates, not in own/enemy body, not a backward move. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: New head (5,7) \u2192 Valid coordinates, not in own/enemy body, not a backward move. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: New head (7,7) \u2192 Matches my snake's tail segment. Fatal (own body collision). Eliminated.\n\nNext, I rank remaining safe moves by follow-up options, apple proximity, and collision risk:\n1. **UP**: Moves head to (6,8), bringing me closer to the nearest reachable apple (7,9). This position keeps 3 potential follow-up moves (UP to 6,9; LEFT to 5,8; RIGHT to 7,8) open, avoiding tight spaces. Enemy snake 1's head (3,5) has no safe moves that would cause a head-on collision here (their safe moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT\u2014none reach (6,8) this turn).\n2. **DOWN**: Moves head to (6,6), closer to the (4,6) apple but increases proximity to enemy snake 1's area (3,5), raising accidental collision risk in future turns. Limits upward access to the (7,9) apple until tail shifts.\n3. **LEFT**: Moves head to (5,7), keeping lateral options open but not advancing toward any nearby apple, delaying score gains.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Next Few Turns\n1. Continue upward or lateral movement to clear a path to the (7,9) apple (nearest reachable) once tail shifts avoid blockages.\n2. Monitor enemy snake 1's movement\u2014avoid their core area (around 3,5) to prevent accidental collisions as both snakes grow.\n3. After collecting (7,9), assess the next nearest apple (likely 4,6) while ensuring tail shifts do not create own-body collision risks.\n4. Avoid moving right until my tail shifts away from (7,7) to eliminate own-body collision risks.\n\nUP",

I prioritize moves that:\n1. Bring me closer to reachable apples.\n2. Minimize enemy collision risk.\n3. Preserve future safe moves.\n- **UP**: New head (6,9) is adjacent to the apple at (7,9) (next turn\u2019s potential apple grab). The top row (y=9) has open space (x=5-8) for follow-up moves, and the enemy (head at (4,7)) cannot reach (6,9) in one turn (low head-on collision risk).\n- **DOWN**: New head (6,7) is farther from the nearest apple (4,6) and brings me closer to the enemy\u2019s current position (4,7), increasing future collision risk.\n- **LEFT**: New head (5,8) moves me away from the nearest apple (7,9) and limits access to top-row opportunities.\n\n### Long-Term Plan (For Future Self)\n1. After moving UP to (6,9), next turn prioritize moving RIGHT to grab the apple at (7,9) (verify it\u2019s still safe and no enemy blockages).\n2. If the apple grab is unsafe, move LEFT or DOWN to maintain open space while monitoring the enemy\u2019s movement (they have head at (4,7) and may target the apple at (4,6)).\n3. As I grow (after apple grabs), track body segments to avoid self-collision and avoid tight spaces (e.g., bottom-left corners with limited escape routes).\n\nUP",

High collision risk.\n   - LEFT (6,7 \u2192 5,7): Follow-up moves limited to 2 (UP, LEFT) due to enemy body at (5,6).

No immediate enemy proximity.\n\n3. **Apple Proximity**:\n   - RIGHT move brings head to (7,7), 2 units from reachable apple (7,9) (closest of any safe move\u2019s new head position).\n\n### Long-Term Plan (For Next Turns)\n1.

Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves head to (8,8). Check safety: Within bounds, not own/enemy body. Safe.\n\n### Step 2: Rank Safe Moves by Criteria\nSafe moves remaining: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. I prioritize moves that eat apples, keep future options open, and avoid head-on collisions:\n- **UP**: Directly targets the apple at (7,9). Collecting this increases my score (from 1 to 2) and has no head-on collision risk (enemy snake #1\u2019s safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) can\u2019t reach (7,9) this turn). After eating, my body becomes [(7,9), (7,8), (7,7)], with adjacent open cells (6,9) and (8,9) for future moves\u2014no trap risk.\n- **LEFT/RIGHT**: Neither targets an apple nor positions me closer to reachable apples. They offer no immediate benefit and are less optimal.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Future Turns\n1. After eating the (7,9) apple, move to an adjacent open cell (LEFT to (6,9) or RIGHT to (8,9)) to avoid trapping myself against the top edge (y=9).\n2. Next, assess the closest reachable apples (likely (4,6) or (4,2)) while monitoring enemy snake #1\u2019s movements\u2014they may target the same lower apples, so avoid direct conflict unless safe.\n3. Track enemy snake #1\u2019s possible moves each turn to prevent head-on collisions (e.g., if they move RIGHT toward (7,4), avoid moving DOWN toward that area).\n\nUP",
