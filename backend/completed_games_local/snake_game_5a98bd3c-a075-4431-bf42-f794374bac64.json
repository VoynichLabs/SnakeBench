The enemy snake is at (1, 3).\n\n*   If I move LEFT, they could move RIGHT right at me, however that would require them to skip an apple at (7, 5).\n*   If I move RIGHT, they could move RIGHT or DOWN.\n*   If I move UP, they will likely move to either RIGHT or DOWN.\n*   If I move DOWN, they will likely move to either RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nLet's evaluate the proximity to apples.

If I go RIGHT to (6, 4) and the enemy goes DOWN, then their path is blocked. However, they could go RIGHT to (2, 3)\n\nIf I go DOWN (5, 3) and the enemy goes RIGHT to (2, 3), then we are closer.
