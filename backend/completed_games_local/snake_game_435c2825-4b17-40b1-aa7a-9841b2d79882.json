The enemy snake is at (5,8) - far from me and not an immediate threat.\n4. I have no body, so I can't hit myself by moving backwards.\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n1. UP: (1,2) - empty space, safe.\n2. DOWN: (1,0) - off the board, invalid.\n3. LEFT: (0,1) - empty space, safe.\n4. RIGHT: (2,1) - apple!

My body is at (2,7) and (2,6), so moving DOWN would kill me (backwards into my own body).\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n1. UP: (2,9) - apple! Safe and collects the apple at (2,9).\n2. DOWN: (2,7) - my own body, invalid (death).\n3. LEFT: (1,8) - empty space, safe but moves away from the closest apple.\n4. RIGHT: (3,8) - empty space, safe but moves away from the closest apple.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **UP (2,9)**: Moves directly onto the apple at (2,9). This is the best move because:\n  - It collects an apple, increasing my score and length.\n  - It avoids moving into danger or away from immediate rewards.\n  - It keeps future options open for collecting other apples.\n- **LEFT (1,8)**: Moves away from the closest apple and doesn't help with collecting any. Not ideal.\n- **RIGHT (3,8)**: Moves away from the closest apple and doesn't help with collecting any. Not ideal.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- UP is the best move because it directly collects the closest apple and keeps me aligned for future moves.\n\n**Long-term consideration:**\nAfter moving UP and collecting the apple at (2,9), I will grow longer. The enemy is far away, so I have time to collect more apples safely. The next closest apple is at (2,4), but I need to plan a path to avoid my own body.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThe best move is UP to collect the apple at (2,9).\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**",

The closest apple is at (0,5), which is directly above my head at (0,1). Moving UP would take me closer to it.\n2. Another apple is at (2,9), which is far to the left and up, but my body is blocking the path.\n3. The enemy snake is close to my tail, but not an immediate threat to my head.\n4. My body is at (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), so moving LEFT would take me to (-1,1), which is off the board (invalid).\n5. Moving UP would take me to (0,2), which is empty and safe.\n6. Moving DOWN would take me to (0,0), which is the enemy snake's head, invalid (death).\n7. Moving RIGHT would take me to (1,1), which is my own body, invalid (death).\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n1. LEFT: (-1,1) - off the board, invalid.\n2. UP: (0,2) - empty space, safe.\n3. DOWN: (0,0) - enemy snake's head, invalid (death).\n4. RIGHT: (1,1) - my own body, invalid (death).\n\n**Analysis:**\n- **UP (0,2)**: Moves me closer to the apple at (0,5) and keeps me safe.\n- **LEFT (-1,1)**: Invalid move (off the board).\n- **DOWN (0,0)**: Invalid move (enemy snake's head).\n- **RIGHT (1,1)**: Invalid move (my own body).\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **UP (0,2)**: This is the only valid move that keeps me safe and moves me closer to an apple.\n\n**Long-term consideration:**\nAfter moving UP, I can continue moving towards the apple at (0,5). The enemy is close to my tail, so I need to be careful not to get trapped.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nThe best move is UP to keep me safe and move me closer to the apple at (0,5).\n\nUP",
