The apples are at (6, 0), (6, 7), (0, 6), (4, 8), (9, 0).\n\nFirst, consider the immediate dangers.\n- Moving LEFT would take me to (5, 2). This is safe.\n- Moving RIGHT would take me to (7, 2). This is safe.\n- Moving UP would take me to (6, 3). This would cause death as I'd run into my own body.\n- Moving DOWN would take me to (6, 1). This is safe.\nI can't go UP.\n\nNow consider the apples and the other snake.\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 2) doesn't immediately lead to an apple.\n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 2) doesn't immediately lead to an apple.\n- Moving DOWN to (6, 1) doesn't immediately lead to an apple, but sets me up to collect the apple at (6,0) next turn.\nThe positions of the other snake is at (3,7). It can move in any direction.\n\nNow let's think about the other snake and future moves.\nThe other snake is at (3,7). I need to anticipate the other snake's movement as well.\nIf I go LEFT to (5,2), I am not sure what to do next turn.\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,2), I am not sure what to do next turn.\nIf I go DOWN to (6,1), I can go to the apple at (6,0) in the next turn.\nLet choose DOWN to (6,1) to go to the apple at (6,0).\n\nStrategy note for next turn: If the other snake comes closer to me I probably have to move away. If it moves away then go for other apples. Need to keep in mind the board edges.\n\nDOWN",
