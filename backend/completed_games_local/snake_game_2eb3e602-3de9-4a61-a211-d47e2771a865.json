There are apples at (7,6), (0,2), (0,1), (4,0), and (4,4).\n\nFirst, I'll check each possible move for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (1,4): This is within the board (0-9). No snake body is there. It's safe.\n- **DOWN** to (1,2): Within board. Apple at (0,2) is nearby but not at (1,2). No snake body there. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (0,3): Within board. No body. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,3): Within board. No body. Safe.\n\nAll four moves are immediately safe.\n\nNow, I need to think about strategy. My goal is to survive and collect apples while avoiding the enemy. The closest apples are at (0,2) and (0,1), both to my left and down. However, the enemy snake is at (2,1), which is near those apples. Moving DOWN to (1,2) gets me closer to (0,2) and (0,1), but it also moves me closer to the enemy's head at (2,1). Since moves are simultaneous, I need to consider where the enemy might go.\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (2,1) might also target those apples. Possible moves for it: UP to (2,2), DOWN to (2,0), LEFT to (1,1), RIGHT to (3,1). If I move DOWN to (1,2), I'm not entering the same cell as any of its possible moves, so no head-on collision risk this turn. However, moving DOWN puts me one step away from (0,2) and (0,1), but also into a row where the enemy could move LEFT to (1,1) \u2014 that's adjacent but not the same cell.\n\nMoving LEFT to (0,3) is safe but takes me away from the closest apples. UP to (1,4) moves toward the apple at (4,4) but it's farther. RIGHT to (2,3) is safe but not toward any immediate apple.\n\nI should prioritize safety and future options. Moving DOWN to (1,2) gives me access to the apples at (0,2) and (0,1) next turn, but I must be cautious of the enemy. However, since the enemy is at (2,1), if it moves LEFT to (1,1), we would be adjacent diagonally, not colliding. No direct collision this turn.\n\nConsidering future moves: from (1,2), my possible next moves would be UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. That seems open. From (1,3), moving DOWN seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (0,3) might be safer in terms of avoiding the enemy, but it's away from apples. I think securing an early apple is important for growth and score.\n\nI'll choose **DOWN** to get closer to the apples at (0,2) and (0,1).\n\n**Short-term plan:** Move toward the cluster of apples at left side (0,2) and (0,1), but watch enemy snake #0's movements to avoid head-on collisions. Try to collect an apple next turn if safe.\n\nDOWN",

Follow up by heading toward the next reachable apple (likely (0,\u202f2) or (4,\u202f0) depending on opponent positions) while keeping options open.\n3.

          "rationale": "Looking at the current board, my snake (ID 1) is at head (1,2) with no body. Enemy snake #0 is at head (1,1). Apples are at (7,6), (0,2), (0,1), (4,0), (4,4).\n\nFirst, check each possible move for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (1,3): Within board (0-9). No snake body there. Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (1,1): That's the enemy's head at (1,1). Moving into another snake's head would cause a head-on collision if enemy stays still, but moves are simultaneous. If enemy moves away, I could occupy (1,1) safely? Wait: rule says \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" The enemy's head is not its body. However, if the enemy stays at (1,1) and I move into (1,1), that's a head-on collision (two heads into same cell). Also, if enemy moves into (1,1) from elsewhere? Actually, enemy is currently at (1,1). If I move into (1,1) and enemy moves out, then I'd be moving into a cell that was occupied by a head at start of turn? The rule: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\" That's about two heads moving into the same cell simultaneously. But here, if enemy moves out, its head leaves (1,1). So if I move into (1,1) and enemy moves elsewhere, no collision. However, there's also rule: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" The enemy's head is not a body. So moving into a cell currently occupied by an enemy head is not automatically fatal if the enemy moves away. But we must consider simultaneous movement: if enemy stays, we collide; if enemy moves into my current cell (1,2), that's also a head-on collision if I stay? Actually, if I move DOWN to (1,1) and enemy moves UP to (1,2), we swap positions, which is allowed because heads don't occupy same cell. So DOWN is potentially safe depending on enemy's move. However, it's risky because if enemy stays, we both die. I'll consider it unsafe for now because I cannot guarantee enemy will move away.\n\n- **LEFT** to (0,2): Within board. Apple at (0,2) is there. No snake body. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,2): Within board. No body. Safe.\n\nSo UP, LEFT, RIGHT are definitely safe. DOWN is risky because it could lead to head-on collision if enemy stays.\n\nNow, consider enemy's possible moves from (1,1). Enemy can move UP to (1,2), DOWN to (1,0), LEFT to (0,1), RIGHT to (2,1). If I move DOWN to (1,1) and enemy moves UP to (1,2), we swap and both survive. If enemy moves LEFT to (0,1) or RIGHT to (2,1) or DOWN to (1,0), I occupy (1,1) alone. Only if enemy stays at (1,1) do we collide. So probability of collision is 1/4 if enemy moves randomly. But I should avoid unnecessary risk.\n\nAmong safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow strategy: I want to collect apples and avoid enemy. Closest apples are at (0,2) and (0,1). Moving LEFT to (0,2) immediately eats the apple at (0,2)! That's great: I grow by 1 segment and gain 1 apple. That also puts my head at (0,2) and my tail will stay at (1,2) (since I grow, my tail doesn't move). Next turn, my body will be from head (0,2) to tail (1,2). That's safe.\n\nCheck if moving LEFT to (0,2) could cause a head-on collision with enemy moving into (0,2) simultaneously? Enemy at (1,1) could move LEFT to (0,1) or UP to (1,2) etc. Enemy cannot move into (0,2) in one move from (1,1) because that's diagonal. So no risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT is safe and gets me an apple immediately.\n\nOther moves: UP to (1,3) moves away from apples. RIGHT to (2,2) moves slightly toward center but not toward any apple.\n\nSo LEFT is clearly the best: it's safe, gains an apple, and grows my snake.\n\n**Long-term plan:** After eating apple at (0,2), my snake will have a body segment at (1,2). Next turn, I'll need to avoid moving back into my body. I'll have more options: from (0,2), possible moves are UP to (0,3), DOWN to (0,1) (apple there), LEFT is off-board (death), RIGHT to (1,2) (my body, death). So next turn, only UP and DOWN are safe. I should plan to go DOWN to (0,1) to eat another apple if possible, but watch enemy movements. Enemy might also target (0,1). I'll assess next turn.\n\n**Final move:** LEFT",

Enemy snake #0 is at head (0,1) with a body segment at (1,1). Apples remain at (7,6), (4,0), (4,4), (7,3), and (0,3).\n\nFirst, I'll check each possible move for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (0,3): Within board. Apple at (0,3) is there. No snake body. Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (0,1): Within board. That's the enemy's head at (0,1). This is risky. If I move into (0,1) and the enemy stays, it's a head-on collision and both die. If the enemy moves away, I could occupy it safely. However, moving into a cell occupied by an enemy head is not automatically fatal if they move out. But it's a gamble. I'll consider it unsafe for now due to high risk.\n- **LEFT**: Off-board (x = -1). Death.\n- **RIGHT** to (1,2): Within board. That's my own body segment. Moving into my own body kills me. Unsafe.\n\nSo my definitely safe moves are only **UP**. DOWN is risky but potentially survivable if the enemy moves away.\n\nNow, consider the enemy's possible moves from (0,1). Their body is at (1,1). Their safe moves are:\n- UP to (0,2): That's my current head position. If they move there and I stay, we'd have a head-on collision? Actually, I would have moved away. If I move UP to (0,3) and they move UP to (0,2), no collision.\n- DOWN to (0,0): Safe, no body.\n- LEFT: Off-board, death.\n- RIGHT to (1,1): That's their own body, death.\n\nSo the enemy's only safe moves are UP to (0,2) and DOWN to (0,0). They cannot stay still (that's not a move). They must choose UP or DOWN.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0,1):\n- If enemy moves UP to (0,2), I occupy (0,1) alone. Safe.\n- If enemy moves DOWN to (0,0), I occupy (0,1) alone. Safe.\nIn both cases, I survive. However, there's a nuance: if the enemy chooses UP to (0,2) and I choose DOWN to (0,1), we swap positions without colliding. So DOWN is actually safe regardless of the enemy's choice, because both of their legal moves avoid (0,1) this turn. Wait, check: Could the enemy choose to stay? The rules say \"each turn, you choose one move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\" Staying still is not a move option. So the enemy must move either UP or DOWN. Therefore, moving DOWN to (0,1) is safe because the enemy will vacate that cell.\n\nThus, DOWN is safe after all. My initial elimination was too cautious.\n\nNow I have two safe moves: UP and DOWN.\n\n**Strategy:** UP leads to apple (0,3), giving me another apple and growth. DOWN leads to enemy's former head position (0,1), which is empty now (no apple). Eating apples is my primary objective to win. Therefore, UP is clearly superior as it gains an apple immediately.\n\nAlso, moving UP to (0,3) gives me more future options next turn: from (0,3), I could go UP to (0,4), DOWN to (0,2) (but that's my body if I grow? Let's see: after eating apple at (0,3), my tail stays at (1,2), so my body will be [(0,3), (0,2), (1,2)? Actually, growth adds a new head at (0,3), and the old head (0,2) becomes a body segment. My tail remains at (1,2). So my body will be: head (0,3), then (0,2), then (1,2). So next turn from (0,3), DOWN to (0,2) would be into my own body, so not safe. But UP to (0,4) and RIGHT to (1,3) might be safe, depending on board state. I'll assess then.\n\nMoving DOWN gains no apple and puts me at (0,1), which is less advantageous.\n\n**Long-term plan:** After eating apple at (0,3), my snake will be length 3. I need to start maneuvering toward other apples while avoiding the enemy. The enemy, after moving from (0,1), will be at either (0,2) or (0,0). If they are at (0,2), they are directly below me. I should avoid moving down into them. I'll aim to move right toward the center apples like (4,4) or (7,3) eventually, but need to navigate around my own growing body.\n\n**Final move:** UP",
