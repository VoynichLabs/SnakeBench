Wait: from (7,1) RIGHT to (8,1) then RIGHT to (9,1) \u2013 yes 2 steps).  \n- (2, 6) and (3, 6) are far.  \n- (1, 9) is far.  \n\nEating soon is good for score and length.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Mobility after each move**  \nIf I go DOWN to (7, 0):  \n- Next turn body will be [(7, 1), (7, 2)]? Actually after moving, my body grows because I ate last turn? Wait: I ate last turn (apple at (7,1)), so my length is now 2 (head at (7,1), body segment at (7,2)). When I move this turn, my tail stays at (7,2) until I eat another apple. So after moving without eating, my body will be: head at new position, then (7,1), then tail at (7,2)? No: Snake growth works like: after eating, you grow by 1 segment at the next move. So last turn I ate, so this turn when I move, my tail does not move \u2014 I grow by 1. That means after this move, my length will be 3 if I eat an apple this turn, otherwise length stays 2? Let's clarify:  \n\nTurn 6: I was at (7,2) with no body.  \nTurn 7: I moved DOWN to (7,1) and ate apple. So after turn 7, I have head (7,1), body segment at (7,2) (where head was). Length = 2.  \n\nNow Turn 8: I move somewhere. If I move onto an apple this turn, I will grow by 1 segment (so after moving, length = 3). If I don\u2019t eat, length stays 2 (head moves, tail moves forward one cell).  \n\nSo:  \n- If I go DOWN to (7,0) (no apple), my new body will be [(7,1)] (tail at old head), old tail (7,2) disappears. So length 2.  \n- If I go LEFT to (6,1) (no apple), same: body becomes [(7,1)], tail gone.  \n- If I go RIGHT to (8,1) (no apple), same.  \n\nBut apple at (8,0) and (9,1) are not in my immediate move targets.  \n\nSo no immediate eating this turn unless I go to an apple cell, but none are in my three valid moves.  \n\nSo I must plan to reach apples next turn.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Future options**  \nFrom each valid move:  \n\n1. DOWN to (7,0):  \n   - Next turn moves from (7,0): UP (7,1) \u2013 will be my body if I don\u2019t eat this turn? Wait: If I go DOWN to (7,0) without eating, my body next turn is [(7,1)], so UP into my body \u2192 invalid.  \n     DOWN (7,-1) off board \u2192 invalid.  \n     LEFT (6,0) \u2013 empty.  \n     RIGHT (8,0) \u2013 contains apple! So from (7,0), next turn RIGHT goes to apple (8,0). That\u2019s good.  \n   So from (7,0) only LEFT and RIGHT are safe next turn, but RIGHT leads to apple.\n\n2. LEFT to (6,1):  \n   - Next turn body: [(7,1)]  \n   Moves from (6,1): UP (6,2) \u2013 empty.  \n     DOWN (6,0) \u2013 empty.  \n     LEFT (5,1) \u2013 empty.  \n     RIGHT (7,1) \u2013 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n   So 3 safe moves next turn. Closest apple: (8,0) is 3 steps away.\n\n3. RIGHT to (8,1):  \n   - Next turn body: [(7,1)]  \n   Moves from (8,1): UP (8,2) \u2013 empty.  \n     DOWN (8,0) \u2013 apple!  \n     LEFT (7,1) \u2013 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n     RIGHT (9,1) \u2013 apple!  \n   So from (8,1), DOWN and RIGHT are apples, UP is safe. That\u2019s 3 safe moves, 2 lead to apples next turn. Very good.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Compare**  \nRIGHT to (8,1) gives best options: next turn I can eat (8,0) or (9,1) with safe moves, and UP also safe for escape.  \nLEFT to (6,1) gives more open space but farther from apples.  \nDOWN to (7,0) forces me to choose between LEFT or RIGHT next turn, but RIGHT is apple (8,0) \u2014 also good, but fewer options.\n\nBest is RIGHT: positions me to eat an apple next turn with multiple choices.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan note**  \nEat (8,0) or (9,1) next turn. Keep enemy far away \u2014 enemy is at top left, I\u2019m bottom right, safe for now. After eating, aim for (2,6)/(3,6) area but watch enemy movement.\n\nRIGHT",

Which gives more options later?  \nUP: next turn only UP to (9,3), then from (9,3) maybe UP to apple (9,4) \u2014 after eating, I\u2019ll be at (9,4) with only DOWN safe (since LEFT/RIGHT off board, UP off board). That\u2019s dead end.  \nDOWN: next turn only LEFT to (8,0), then from (8,0) maybe LEFT to (7,0) etc., more central.  \n\nDOWN seems better because next turn\u2019s forced move (LEFT) gets me off the edge.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn**  \nAfter DOWN to (9,0), next turn only LEFT to (8,0) is safe. Then from (8,0) I\u2019ll have UP (body?), DOWN off, LEFT (7,0), RIGHT (9,0 body?) \u2014 need to check next turn\u2019s body positions.

No, apple still there unless eaten by enemy). Actually (5, 0) is apple now, but after my move to (4, 0), next turn (5, 0) still apple unless enemy eats it.  \nSo 2 moves available next turn (LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n**If LEFT to (3, 1):**  \nNext turn body: head (3, 1), then (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1) \u2014 tail (7, 0) gone.  \nFrom (3, 1) next turn:  \n- UP (3, 2) empty.  \n- DOWN (3, 0) empty.  \n- LEFT (2, 1) empty.  \n- RIGHT (4, 1) my body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo 3 moves available next turn.  \n\nDOWN gives fewer future moves.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nClosest apple: (5, 0) is 1 step away at RIGHT-DOWN from (4, 1) but RIGHT is blocked.  \nFrom (4, 1), to get (5, 0) I\u2019d need to go DOWN then RIGHT next turn, but DOWN now gives only 2 moves next turn, risky.  \nOther apples: (2, 4) and (1, 3) are to the left/up.  \n(2, 6) is up-left.  \n(1, 9) far away.  \n\nLEFT or UP moves me toward (2, 4) and (1, 3).  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction**  \nEnemy at (9, 3) likely wants apples too. Closest apple to enemy is (5, 0)? Actually (5, 0) is closer to me.

Need to collect apples but avoid being trapped.  \nLEFT to (3, 1) keeps options open (3 moves next turn) and moves toward apples (2, 4) and (1, 3).  \nUP to (4, 2) also good, but LEFT gets me away from enemy\u2019s possible path toward (5, 0).  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Decision**  \nLEFT seems best: moves toward apples, keeps flexibility, and enemy is far right.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 1), consider moving UP toward (2, 4) or (1, 3), but check enemy position first.

No immediate head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Check for enemy body collision**  \nEnemy body: (8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4) \u2014 none at (2, 4), (2, 2), (1, 3).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nUP to (2, 4) eats apple at (2, 4) \u2192 grow to length 6, tail stays at (4, 1) for now.  \nLEFT to (1, 3) eats apple at (1, 3) \u2192 grow to length 6.  \nDOWN to (2, 2) gets no apple.  \n\nBoth UP and LEFT give an apple this turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Future options after each move**  \n\n**If UP to (2, 4) and eat apple:**  \nNew body: head (2, 4), then (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1) \u2014 length 6.  \nFrom (2, 4) next turn:  \n- UP (2, 5) empty.  \n- DOWN (2, 3) my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (1, 4) empty.  \n- RIGHT (3, 4) empty.  \nSo 3 moves available next turn.  \n\n**If LEFT to (1, 3) and eat apple:**  \nNew body: head (1, 3), then (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1) \u2014 length 6.  \nFrom (1, 3) next turn:  \n- UP (1, 4) empty.  \n- DOWN (1, 2) empty.  \n- LEFT (0, 3) empty.  \n- RIGHT (2, 3) my body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo 3 moves available next turn.  \n\n**If DOWN to (2, 2):**  \nNew body: head (2, 2), then (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1) \u2014 tail (4, 1) gone.  \nFrom (2, 2) next turn:  \n- UP (2, 3) my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (2, 1) empty.  \n- LEFT (1, 2) empty.  \n- RIGHT (3, 2) my body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo only 2 moves available next turn (DOWN, LEFT).  \n\nDOWN reduces future options.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nI need apples to catch up to enemy (4 vs 6 apples).  \nBoth UP and LEFT give an apple now.  \nFrom (2, 4) after UP: next turn I could go UP toward (2, 6) apple eventually, or LEFT toward (1, 3) is gone, so only (2, 6) and (1, 9) remain.  \nFrom (1, 3) after LEFT: next turn I could go UP toward (1, 9) eventually, or DOWN toward (5, 0) eventually, or LEFT toward board edge.  \n\nEnemy is far away in bottom right, not an immediate threat.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nBoth UP and LEFT are safe and give an apple.  \nDOWN is safe but no apple and fewer future moves.  \n\nI prefer UP to (2, 4) because it keeps me more central and leaves (1, 3) apple for later if needed, but actually eating (2, 4) now is fine.  \nFrom (2, 4) I can later go UP toward (2, 6).  \nFrom (1, 3) I\u2019d be near left edge, which could be riskier later.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving UP to (2, 4) and eating apple, next turn from (2, 4) consider UP to (2, 5) to approach (2, 6) apple, or LEFT to (1, 4) to stay flexible. Avoid moving into confined spaces. Check enemy position then.  \n\nUP",

No immediate head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Check for enemy body collision**  \nEnemy body: (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 2) \u2014 none at (1, 9), (0, 8), (2, 8).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nApple at (1, 9) is one step up. Apple at (1, 3) is far down. Apple at (6, 8) far. Apple at (8, 5) far. Apple at (5, 5) is closer but blocked by my body path.  \n\nClosest apple is (1, 9) via UP.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Future options after each move**  \n\n**If UP to (1, 9) \u2013 eat apple**  \nNew length: 9 segments (apples = 8). Tail stays at (3, 3) for now (since growth adds segment at tail next move).  \nFrom (1, 9) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 my body (old head) \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 9) \u2192 empty.  \nSo 2 moves available (LEFT, RIGHT). This is a bit limiting (top edge).  \n\n**If LEFT to (0, 8)**  \nFrom (0, 8) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 7) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 my old head position (now body) \u2192 invalid.  \nSo 2 moves available (UP, DOWN).  \n\n**If RIGHT to (2, 8)**  \nFrom (2, 8) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 7) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 my old head (body) \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 8) \u2192 empty.  \nSo 2 moves available (UP, RIGHT).  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Risk of trapping**  \nUP leads to top edge with only left/right next turn, but I get an apple and grow, making me longer (9).  \nLEFT and RIGHT keep me away from apple but give more central position next turn.  \n\nHowever, enemy is at (6, 2) and may go for (5, 5) apple soon. I need apples to catch up in score (7 vs 9).  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP gives immediate apple, increasing my length and score. Even though next turn options are limited to 2, I can plan to go left toward (0, 9) then down along left edge to avoid enemy.  \nLEFT or RIGHT avoid apple but keep flexibility \u2014 but enemy is longer, so I need to grow.  \n\nBest choice: UP to eat apple now.  \n\n**Plan for next turn after UP:**  \nFrom (1, 9), choose LEFT to (0, 9) to stay along edge, then next turn go DOWN to (0, 8) and eventually toward (1, 3) apple or (5, 5) if safe. Avoid enemy head area (around x=6).  \n\nUP",

That\u2019s dangerous: if enemy goes UP to (6, 8) and I go RIGHT to (5, 8), we are not colliding heads (different cells), but next turn we could be adjacent. Wait, check head-on collision: head-on collision only if we land on same cell. (5, 8) vs (6, 8) are different cells, so no head-on collision this turn.  \n\nBut also check if enemy could move to (5, 8)? No, enemy can\u2019t move DOWN, can\u2019t move to (5, 8) from (6, 7) in one move.

Then we are adjacent horizontally. Next turn, if I go RIGHT to (6, 8) while enemy stays or moves, possible head-on collision. But I can avoid by not going RIGHT next turn if enemy is there. Still, being adjacent to enemy head is risky because they could move into my head next turn if I move into their cell.  \n\nBetter to approach apple from a different angle?  \n\nDOWN to (4, 7) keeps me farther from enemy head now, and I can approach (5, 5) or (7, 7) later.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term safety**  \nUP (4, 9) leads to only 1 move next turn \u2192 avoid.  \nRIGHT (5, 8) is adjacent to possible enemy move to (6, 8) \u2192 increases risk.  \nDOWN (4, 7) is safe now, keeps options open, moves toward center where more apples are.  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Final choice**  \nDOWN seems safest: avoids trapping myself, avoids immediate adjacency with enemy head, keeps 3 options next turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 7), consider moving toward (5, 5) or (7, 7), watch enemy head movement. Enemy may eat (6, 8) apple this turn, growing longer. Keep distance from enemy head to avoid head-on collisions.  \n\nDOWN",

RIGHT moves toward (7,8), keeps me clear of Snake #1\u2019s potential paths, and puts me in position to grab the apple at (7,7) next turn with plenty of follow-up room.\n\nPlan: After moving right, drop down to (7,7) to pick up that apple, then head toward the remaining apples on the right side (especially (8,5)) while keeping access to open space above and avoiding close contact with Snake #1.\n\nRIGHT",

Need to check enemy\u2019s possible moves then, but for now, DOWN seems best for options and safety.  \n\n**Final choice:** DOWN  \n\nDOWN",

So body: [(5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7)] \u2013 length 11.  \nFrom (5, 5) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 6) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 4) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 5) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 5) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo 2 moves available (UP, DOWN).  \n\n**LEFT to (3, 5)** \u2013 no apple.  \nFrom (3, 5) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (3, 6) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 4) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 5) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 5) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo 3 moves available (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n\n**DOWN to (4, 4)** \u2013 no apple.  \nFrom (4, 4) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 5) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 apple.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 4) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 4) \u2192 empty.  \nSo 3 moves available (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple targeting and growth**  \nClosest apples: (5, 5) is 1 step away (RIGHT), (4, 3) is 2 steps away (DOWN then DOWN). Eating (5, 5) gets me to 10 apples, enemy has 11. Eating is good to catch up.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk of adjacency with enemy head**  \nEnemy at (7, 7) is 2 away from (5, 5) (Manhattan distance 2).  \nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 5), enemy could go DOWN to (7, 6) or RIGHT to (8, 7) \u2013 still 2 or 3 away, not adjacent.  \nIf I go LEFT to (3, 5), enemy is 4 away.  \nDOWN to (4, 4) is 3 away.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term safety**  \nRIGHT (5, 5) only gives 2 moves next turn, but I eat an apple and grow.  \nLEFT (3, 5) gives 3 moves but moves away from most apples.  \nDOWN (4, 4) gives 3 moves and sets up to eat (4, 3) next turn.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Plan for next turn**  \nIf I eat (5, 5), I\u2019ll be at (5, 5) with only UP/DOWN available next turn, which is risky.  \nIf I go DOWN to (4, 4), I keep more options and can go for (4, 3) next turn.  \nBut enemy has 11 apples, I have 9, catching up is important. Eating (5, 5) now might be worth the slight risk of fewer moves next turn, because I can then go UP to (5, 6) or DOWN to (5, 4) to regain space.  \n\nAlso, enemy body blocks (6, 5), so RIGHT from (5, 5) is blocked next turn anyway, but that\u2019s fine.  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Decision**  \nI think eating the apple at (5, 5) is the best move because:  \n1. It\u2019s safe this turn (no collision risk).  \n2. It grows me, closing the apple gap.  \n3. Next turn from (5, 5) I still have 2 moves, both open, not immediately deadly.  \n4. Avoiding it to keep more moves might let enemy get more ahead.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5, 5), choose UP or DOWN based on enemy position then. Try to avoid moving toward enemy\u2019s area unless safe.  \n\n**Final choice:** RIGHT",

That\u2019s okay because I can go left/right from (4, 0).  \n\nApple (5, 1) is near enemy body at (6, 3), (6, 4) etc., but not too close.  \n\nI think DOWN to (4, 1) is slightly better because:  \n- Gets apple (4, 0) next turn.  \n- From (4, 1) I can also go RIGHT to (5, 1) if enemy threatens (4, 0) path.  \n- It avoids moving toward enemy side (RIGHT moves slightly closer to enemy).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 1), if enemy not near (4, 0), go DOWN to eat apple (4, 0). If enemy might head there, consider LEFT or RIGHT to other apples.  \n\nDOWN",

That\u2019s worse than I thought.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Re-evaluate**  \nAll three moves leave only 2 safe moves next turn. That\u2019s concerning. Need to pick the one with best future safety/apple path.  \n\n- UP (6, 2): next turn only UP or RIGHT. UP leads to (6, 3), then maybe more space.  \n- DOWN (6, 0): next turn only LEFT or RIGHT. LEFT (5, 0) is apple \u2014 could eat apple next turn if I go DOWN now, then LEFT next turn. That\u2019s promising.  \n- RIGHT (7, 1): next turn only UP or DOWN, both open but near enemy body at (8, 1) and (7, 6), etc.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Apple opportunity**  \nIf I go DOWN now to (6, 0), next turn I can go LEFT to (5, 0) and eat apple (4, 0) \u2014 wait, (5, 0) is not apple, apple is at (4, 0). So from (6, 0), LEFT to (5, 0) is empty, then next turn from (5, 0) I could go LEFT to (4, 0) apple. So two turns to get apple.  \n\nBut enemy could interfere.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Enemy head proximity**  \nEnemy at (7, 1) could go DOWN to (7, 0) \u2014 that\u2019s adjacent to my DOWN target (6, 0). That\u2019s risky because next turn he could collide with me if we both move into same cell.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 0) and enemy goes DOWN to (7, 0), we\u2019re adjacent horizontally. Next turn if I go LEFT to (5, 0) and he goes LEFT to (6, 0), we swap \u2014 no collision. But if he goes LEFT to (6, 0) when I\u2019m at (5, 0), fine. Still, being adjacent to enemy head is riskier.  \n\nIf I go UP to (6, 2), enemy could go UP to (7, 2) \u2014 also adjacent.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 1), enemy likely not going to (7, 1) because he\u2019s leaving it.  \n\nActually, RIGHT might be safest this turn because we won\u2019t be adjacent after move:  \n- If enemy goes LEFT to (6, 1), I go RIGHT to (7, 1) \u2192 we\u2019re not adjacent (he\u2019s at (6, 1), I\u2019m at (7, 1)).  \n- If enemy goes UP to (7, 2), I\u2019m at (7, 1) \u2192 adjacent vertically.  \n- If enemy goes DOWN to (7, 0), I\u2019m at (7, 1) \u2192 adjacent vertically.  \n\nSo RIGHT still possibly adjacent.  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Choose best**  \nI think DOWN to (6, 0) gives a clear path to apple (4, 0) in two turns, and enemy less likely to go to (7, 0) immediately? Not sure.  \n\nBut given all moves leave 2 options next turn, I\u2019ll pick the one that leads toward nearest apple while avoiding enemy adjacency if possible.  \n\nUP (6, 2) \u2192 next turn UP to (6, 3) toward center, more space later.  \nDOWN (6, 0) \u2192 next turn toward apple.  \nRIGHT (7, 1) \u2192 next turn only up/down, near enemy body.  \n\nI\u2019ll go UP to keep away from enemy head\u2019s likely DOWN move and get more space.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 2), go UP to (6, 3) if safe, to move toward center and eventually apple (5, 9) or (7, 4). Watch enemy head movement.  \n\nUP",

Wait, check RIGHT: enemy head is at (7, 2) now, but both move simultaneously. Moving RIGHT to (7, 2) could cause head-on collision if enemy stays there. Enemy must move somewhere else this turn, so (7, 2) will be empty when I arrive unless enemy moves into it from elsewhere.  \n\nEnemy head at (7, 2) possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 3) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 1) \u2192 its own body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 2) \u2192 my head currently there.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 2) \u2192 its own body \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo enemy can only go UP to (7, 3). That means enemy will leave (7, 2) empty. My moving RIGHT to (7, 2) is safe from head-on collision because enemy won\u2019t be there.  \n\nBut check: if enemy goes UP to (7, 3) and I go RIGHT to (7, 2), no collision.  \n\nSo valid moves: UP, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Immediate collision risk with enemy head**  \nEnemy moving to (7, 3).  \nMy UP (6, 3) vs enemy (7, 3) \u2192 adjacent horizontally, not same cell.  \nMy RIGHT (7, 2) vs enemy (7, 3) \u2192 adjacent vertically.  \nNo head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Check for enemy body collision**  \nEnemy body cells: (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6).  \nMy possible moves:  \n- (6, 3) \u2192 not in enemy body.  \n- (7, 2) \u2192 not in enemy body.  \n\nBoth safe from enemy body this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nApples: (1, 3), (4, 0), (5, 9), (9, 7), (7, 4).  \n- UP (6, 3) \u2192 no apple, moves toward (5, 9) or (7, 4) eventually.  \n- RIGHT (7, 2) \u2192 no apple, moves toward (7, 4) apple (2 steps up).  \n\nNo immediate apple consumption this turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options after each move**  \n\n**UP to (6, 3)** \u2013 next turn from (6, 3):  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 4) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 2) \u2192 my body (old head) \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 3) \u2192 my body? Check: my body has (4, 3), (5, 4), etc. (5, 3) is empty. Actually (5, 3) is free.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 3) \u2192 enemy head will be there this turn, but next turn enemy could move away. Need to check: enemy at (7, 3) next turn possible moves: UP (7, 4) apple, DOWN (7, 2) empty, LEFT (6, 3) my head if I go UP now, RIGHT (8, 3) enemy body. So enemy could go DOWN to (7, 2) or UP to (7, 4). If enemy goes DOWN to (7, 2), then (7, 3) empty for me next turn if I choose RIGHT. But risky to plan that.  \n\nActually, from (6, 3) next turn:  \nUP (6, 4) free, DOWN invalid, LEFT (5, 3) free, RIGHT (7, 3) possibly occupied by enemy if enemy stays, but enemy likely moves. So 3 safe moves likely (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n**RIGHT to (7, 2)** \u2013 next turn from (7, 2):  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 3) \u2192 enemy head will be there this turn, but next turn enemy moves away possibly. If enemy goes UP to (7, 4), then (7, 3) free. But if enemy goes DOWN to (7, 2) \u2014 wait, enemy at (7, 3) can go DOWN to (7, 2) which is where I\u2019d be. That\u2019s a possible head-on collision next turn if we both choose that.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 1) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 2) \u2192 my old body (now empty? No, after I move, my old head (6, 2) becomes body, so (6, 2) will be my body next turn \u2192 invalid).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 2) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo from (7, 2) next turn, only UP is possibly safe, but enemy could move into (7, 3) or (7, 2) depending. Actually, if enemy at (7, 3) goes DOWN to (7, 2), that\u2019s where I am \u2192 I die. So being at (7, 2) next turn is dangerous because enemy can kill me by moving down.  \n\nThus RIGHT now puts me in a risky spot next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose safest**  \nUP gives more options next turn and avoids being in line for enemy\u2019s possible DOWN move from (7, 3).  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nFrom (6, 3), consider moving toward (7, 4) apple or (5, 9). Avoid getting near enemy head\u2019s path. Keep space open.  \n\nUP",

RIGHT is invalid because (7, 3) currently occupied by enemy head (moving there would be head-on collision if enemy stays, but enemy will move simultaneously; still, moving into a cell currently occupied by another head is risky and could cause death if both choose to stay/swap). Let\u2019s check enemy\u2019s possible moves from (7, 3):  \n\nEnemy head at (7, 3) possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 4) \u2192 apple at (7, 4).  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 2) \u2192 enemy\u2019s own body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 3) \u2192 my head currently there.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 3) \u2192 enemy\u2019s own body \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo enemy can only go UP to (7, 4). That means enemy will leave (7, 3) empty this turn.  \n\nThus, if I go RIGHT to (7, 3), enemy goes UP to (7, 4) \u2014 no head-on collision. So RIGHT is actually safe this turn.  \n\nSo valid moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Immediate collision risk with enemy head**  \nEnemy moving to (7, 4).  \nMy UP (6, 4) vs enemy (7, 4) \u2192 adjacent horizontally.  \nMy LEFT (5, 3) vs enemy (7, 4) \u2192 not adjacent.  \nMy RIGHT (7, 3) vs enemy (7, 4) \u2192 adjacent vertically (enemy above me).  \n\nNo head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Check for enemy body collision**  \nEnemy body cells: (7, 2), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7).  \nMy possible moves:  \n- (6, 4) \u2192 not in enemy body.  \n- (5, 3) \u2192 not in enemy body.  \n- (7, 3) \u2192 not in enemy body.  \n\nAll safe from enemy body this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nApples: (1, 3), (4, 0), (5, 9), (9, 7), (7, 4).  \n- UP (6, 4) \u2192 no apple, moves toward (5, 9) or (9, 7).  \n- LEFT (5, 3) \u2192 no apple, moves toward (1, 3) or (4, 0).  \n- RIGHT (7, 3) \u2192 no apple, but apple at (7, 4) will be eaten by enemy this turn (enemy moving there).  \n\nSo no immediate apple for me this turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options after each move**  \n\n**UP to (6, 4)** \u2013 next turn from (6, 4):  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 5) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 3) \u2192 my body (old head) \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 4) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 4) \u2192 enemy head will be there this turn, but next turn enemy may move away. Could be risky if enemy stays.  \n\nSo from (6, 4) next turn, UP is safe, DOWN invalid, LEFT invalid, RIGHT possibly occupied. Only 1 definitely safe move (UP).  \n\n**LEFT to (5, 3)** \u2013 next turn from (5, 3):  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 4) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 2) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 3) \u2192 my body (old head) \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo only DOWN is safe next turn. That\u2019s a dead-end path \u2014 risky.  \n\n**RIGHT to (7, 3)** \u2013 next turn from (7, 3):  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 4) \u2192 enemy head will be there this turn, but next turn enemy may move away. If enemy goes UP to (7, 5) or DOWN to (7, 3) \u2014 wait, enemy at (7, 4) next turn possible moves: UP (7, 5) empty, DOWN (7, 3) where I would be, LEFT (6, 4) empty, RIGHT (8, 4) enemy body. So enemy could move DOWN into me.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 2) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 3) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 3) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo from (7, 3) next turn, only UP is possibly safe, but enemy could move DOWN and kill me.  \n\nThus, UP gives 1 safe move next turn, LEFT gives 1 safe move next turn, RIGHT gives risky 1 move.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose safest with most options**  \nUP seems slightly better than LEFT because from (6, 4) I can go UP again, possibly toward (5, 9) apple. LEFT leads to (5, 3) with only DOWN next turn, which goes to (5, 2) \u2014 then maybe into my own body constraints.  \n\nAlso, enemy is at (7, 4) after this turn, so staying away from column 7 reduces head-on risk.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nFrom (6, 4), consider moving UP toward (5, 9) apple. Avoid getting near enemy head\u2019s path. Keep space open.  \n\nUP",

Enemy is at (7, 5) after this turn, so moving UP again next turn to (6, 6) keeps distance.  \n\nRIGHT is riskier because it puts me adjacent to enemy\u2019s head next turn with fewer escape options.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Choose safest**  \nUP is the clear safer choice.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 5), enemy at (7, 5).

Not allowed \u2014 must choose a direction, so it will choose LEFT (into me) or possibly UP/DOWN/RIGHT if I misread body? Let's recheck enemy body:  \n\nEnemy body list: (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8).  \n\nFrom (7, 5):  \n- UP (7, 6) \u2192 in enemy body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (7, 4) \u2192 in enemy body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (6, 5) \u2192 my head.  \n- RIGHT (8, 5) \u2192 in enemy body \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo indeed enemy\u2019s only possible move is LEFT into my head. That means if I go RIGHT into (7, 5), we swap heads? Wait, simultaneous movement:  \nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 5) and enemy goes LEFT to (6, 5), we cross into each other\u2019s old positions \u2014 no head-on collision in same cell. But head-on collision requires same destination cell. Here:  \nMy destination: (7, 5)  \nEnemy destination: (6, 5)  \nDifferent cells, so no head-on collision.  \n\nBut next step: after moving, our heads are at (7, 5) and (6, 5) \u2014 adjacent.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Immediate safety of RIGHT**  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (6, 5), which is my current position, that\u2019s empty after I leave, so enemy survives. I move to (7, 5), which is empty after enemy leaves. So both survive this turn.  \n\nSo RIGHT is actually safe this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future options**  \n\nUP to (6, 6):  \nNext turn from (6, 6):  \n- UP (6, 7) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN (6, 5) \u2192 my body (old head position? Wait, after moving, body shifts: new body will be (6, 5) as first segment, then (6, 4), etc. So (6, 5) is my body next turn, so DOWN invalid.  \n- LEFT (5, 6) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (7, 6) \u2192 enemy body.  \n\nSo from (6, 6) next turn, UP and LEFT are safe.  \n\nRIGHT to (7, 5):  \nNext turn from (7, 5):  \n- UP (7, 6) \u2192 enemy body.  \n- DOWN (7, 4) \u2192 enemy body.  \n- LEFT (6, 5) \u2192 my body.  \n- RIGHT (8, 5) \u2192 enemy body.  \n\nSo from (7, 5) next turn, all 4 moves are blocked \u2014 I\u2019d be trapped and die.  \n\nThus RIGHT is a death trap next turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nApples: (1, 3), (4, 0), (5, 9), (9, 7), (9, 4).  \nUP moves toward (5, 9) or (9, 7).  \nRIGHT moves toward (9, 4) but will be dead next turn, so useless.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy\u2019s situation**  \nEnemy is trapped next turn too if it goes LEFT to (6, 5):  \nFrom (6, 5) next turn (enemy\u2019s head):  \n- UP (6, 6) \u2192 empty unless I go there this turn. If I go UP this turn, I\u2019ll be at (6, 6), so enemy\u2019s UP next turn would be my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (6, 4) \u2192 my body.  \n- LEFT (5, 5) \u2192 my body.  \n- RIGHT (7, 5) \u2192 my body if I go RIGHT this turn, or empty if I go UP this turn.  \n\nSo enemy will have only RIGHT safe if I go UP this turn.  \n\nIf I go UP, enemy goes LEFT to (6, 5), then next turn enemy\u2019s only safe move is RIGHT to (7, 5) (empty then). That gives enemy a path out.  \n\nBut if I go UP, I stay ahead of enemy and can keep moving toward apples.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nRIGHT leads to certain death next turn.  \nUP leads to at least 2 safe moves next turn and continues toward apples.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 6), enemy likely at (6, 5). I can go UP to (6, 7) or LEFT to (5, 6) to avoid being adjacent to enemy head and to approach (5, 9) apple.  \n\nUP",
