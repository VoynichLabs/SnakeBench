If snake #1 goes up this turn, it may eat this apple. The apple at (7,7) and (8,4) are farther away.\n\nSince I'm at the beginning of the game, I should concentrate on getting apples and not colliding with other snakes.

It is a certain distance away. If snake #1 moves RIGHT, it will go to (4, 6) which is away from my trajectory.

So 3 safe moves.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nClosest apple to (3,8):  \n- (6,8) distance |6-3|+|8-8| = 3  \n- (7,7) distance 4  \n- (8,4) distance 7  \n- (5,2) distance 6  \n- (6,2) distance 5  \n\nLEFT (2,8) moves away from (6,8).  \nRIGHT (4,8) moves toward (6,8) (distance now 2).  \nUP (3,9) moves away from all apples except maybe (6,8) distance increases to 4.  \n\nSo RIGHT is best for apple (6,8).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction**  \nEnemy at (3,2) might go toward apples at (5,2) or (6,2). It could go RIGHT to (4,2) or UP to (3,3). It\u2019s far away, not a threat now.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Avoid dead ends**  \nUP (3,9) leaves only 2 safe moves next turn (LEFT, RIGHT), and is top edge.  \nLEFT (2,8) and RIGHT (4,8) leave 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nRIGHT moves toward nearest apple (6,8), keeps more future options, safe.  \nUP is safe but worse for apples and more limiting next turn.  \nLEFT safe but moves away from nearest apple.  \n\nBest: RIGHT.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter RIGHT, head at (4,8), body at (3,8).  \nCheck new apples, avoid moving LEFT into body.  \nAim for (6,8) but watch enemy\u2019s possible moves toward that apple.  \nKeep space to maneuver, maybe consider going DOWN toward other apples later.  \n\nRIGHT",

No enemy body there. Safe from enemy head? Enemy at (5, 2) can\u2019t reach (5, 9) in one move. Safe this turn.  \n\n2. **DOWN (5, 7):** empty board per state. Safe from enemy head (enemy far away). Safe this turn.  \n\n3. **LEFT (4, 8):** my own body \u2192 immediate death \u2192 illegal.  \n\n4. **RIGHT (6, 8):** contains apple. If I move there, I eat apple, grow by 1 (new head at (6, 8), old head becomes body at (5, 8), tail stays? Actually tail at (4, 8) will stay until next move because growth happens after move).  \n   Danger? No enemy body there now. Enemy at (5, 2) can\u2019t reach (6, 8) in one turn. Safe this turn.  \n\nSo all of UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe immediately.  \n\n---\n\n**Future options after each move:**\n\n- **RIGHT (6, 8):** eat apple \u2192 length becomes 3 after this turn (head at (6, 8), body: (5, 8), (4, 8)). Next turn from (6, 8), possible moves: UP (6, 9), DOWN (6, 7), LEFT (5, 8) (my own body from previous head), RIGHT (7, 8). So two safe moves next turn if no enemy interferes. Also gets me closer to apple at (7, 7).  \n\n- **UP (5, 9):** from (5, 9) next turn, moves: DOWN back to (5, 8) (body after move), LEFT (4, 9), RIGHT (6, 9). DOWN blocked by body (old head becomes (5, 8) body). So only LEFT and RIGHT safe next turn. Edge of board at top but not trapped yet.  \n\n- **DOWN (5, 7):** from (5, 7) next turn, moves: UP back to (5, 8) (body), DOWN (5, 6), LEFT (4, 7), RIGHT (6, 7). UP blocked, so 3 moves safe unless enemy moves into them.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy prediction:** Enemy likely to go RIGHT to (6, 2) to eat apple there. That doesn\u2019t affect my immediate choice.  \n\n**Long-term:** Eating apples now is good for score, but must avoid getting trapped. Right now board is sparse, so eating apple at (6, 8) is safe and gives growth for future survival.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I eat apple at (6, 8), my body will occupy (5, 8) and (4, 8), so my head at (6, 8) will have to avoid moving back LEFT into (5, 8) next turn. That\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll have other moves. After eating, head toward (7, 7) or (8, 4) while staying safe from enemy.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, enemy is far away at y=2, so not an immediate danger.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5, 7) \u2014 empty, safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7, 7) \u2014 contains an apple, safe unless enemy moves there simultaneously (head-on collision).  \n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Check enemy\u2019s possible moves from (7, 2)\nEnemy body: [(7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2)]  \nFrom (7, 2):  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 3) \u2014 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 1) \u2014 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 2) \u2014 occupied by its own body segment (the neck), so unsafe for enemy (they will avoid).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 2) \u2014 empty.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Danger of head-on collision\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 7), enemy is at (7, 2) \u2014 no chance of them reaching (7, 7) in one move (they\u2019d need y+5). So no head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\nSo RIGHT to (7, 7) is safe and eats an apple.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Other safe moves\nLEFT to (5, 7) \u2014 safe.  \nDOWN to (6, 6) \u2014 safe.  \nUP to (6, 8) \u2014 unsafe (my body).  \n\nSo safe moves: RIGHT, LEFT, DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Future options\nIf I eat apple at (7, 7):  \n- My length grows by 1, so next turn my body will be head at (7, 7), then old head (6, 7) becomes new neck, then (6, 8), then (5, 8).  \n- Apple disappears, new apple spawns somewhere else (not given, but will appear next turn).  \n\nEating apple now increases my score to 3 vs enemy\u2019s 2.  \n\nFrom (7, 7) next turn, possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 8) \u2014 currently empty (board shows nothing at (7,8)).  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 6) \u2014 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 7) \u2014 occupied by my new neck segment next turn, so unsafe next turn (so would eliminate LEFT).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 7) \u2014 empty.  \n\nSo after eating apple at (7, 7), I lose LEFT as an option next turn, but still have UP, DOWN, RIGHT \u2014 not too constrained.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Compare other safe moves  \nLEFT to (5, 7): moves away from nearest apple, not beneficial unless avoiding danger \u2014 but no danger right now.  \n\nDOWN to (6, 6): moves toward board center but away from apples except maybe (8,4) later, but not directly helpful now.  \n\nRIGHT to (7, 7): immediate apple, increases lead.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Long-term plan note  \nEating apples early builds lead. After eating (7,7), move toward other apples while avoiding getting trapped near walls or enemy. Enemy is far south, so safe for now.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nRIGHT",

Let\u2019s check). Actually from (8, 7), RIGHT goes to (9, 7), then from (9, 7) only LEFT is safe (since UP/DOWN might be safe unless body there). So not ideal to go to (9, 7) unless necessary. But I don\u2019t have to go RIGHT twice.  \n\nFrom (8, 7), I can go DOWN toward apple (8, 4) next turn. That\u2019s fine.  \n\nFrom (7, 6): many options open.  \nFrom (7, 8): many options open.  \n\nBut RIGHT gets me closer to apple and doesn\u2019t trap me yet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Avoid dead ends\n(8, 7) is not dead end; I can go UP/DOWN/RIGHT next turn (LEFT is blocked by my own neck). That\u2019s still 3 options.  \n\n(7, 6) gives UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT all possibly safe next turn unless my body moves there. Actually next turn my body will be: head at new position, neck at (7, 7), then (6, 7), then (6, 8), then (5, 8). So from (7, 6), all adjacent cells likely empty except maybe (7, 7) is my neck. So safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT? Let\u2019s check:  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 7) my neck \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo from (7, 6) next turn, safe: DOWN (7,5), LEFT (6,6), RIGHT (8,6). That\u2019s 3 options.  \n\nSimilarly from (7, 8) next turn: safe: UP (7,9), LEFT (6,8) is my body? Wait (6,8) is my 3rd segment next turn? Let\u2019s trace:  \nNext turn body if I move RIGHT now: head at (8,7), neck at (7,7), then (6,7), then (6,8), then (5,8).  \nSo (6,8) is my 4th segment. From (7,8) next turn if I go UP now:  \nAdjacent: UP (7,9) empty, DOWN (7,7) my neck unsafe, LEFT (6,8) my body unsafe, RIGHT (8,8) empty. So only 2 options: UP and RIGHT. That\u2019s worse.  \n\nSo UP now \u2192 fewer options next turn.  \nDOWN now \u2192 3 options next turn.  \nRIGHT now \u2192 3 options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Choose\nRIGHT gets me closer to apple (8,4), keeps good options, no immediate risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:** After eating (8,4), move toward other apples while keeping enemy at a distance. Enemy is far south currently, so safe. Avoid trapping self in right edge after going to (9, y).  \n\nRIGHT",

Check possible moves from (8, 6):\n- **UP** \u2192 (8, 7) \u2192 occupied by my own body (second segment). **Not safe**.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8, 5) \u2192 empty on board? Let\u2019s check:  \n  Board shows nothing at (8, 5) in the ASCII grid. Enemy body? Enemy head at (8, 4) \u2260 (8, 5). My body? No. So **safe** for now.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7, 6) \u2192 empty on board (grid shows '.' at 7,6). My body? My body cells: (8,7), (7,7), (6,7) \u2014 none at (7,6). Enemy body? Enemy body: (8,3), (8,2), (7,2) \u2014 none at (7,6). So **safe**.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9, 6) \u2192 has an apple at (9, 6) (grid shows 'A' at 9,6). Is it safe? Check: enemy head at (8,4) \u2260 (9,6), enemy body not at (9,6). My body not at (9,6). So **safe**.\n\nSo all of DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe moves. UP is unsafe (own body).\n\n---\n\n### 2. Consider enemy snake\u2019s possible moves from (8, 4):\nEnemy body: [(8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2)]  \nPossible for enemy:  \n- UP \u2192 (8, 5) \u2014 safe for them (empty now)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 3) \u2014 occupied by their own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 4) \u2014 empty \u2192 safe  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 4) \u2014 empty \u2192 safe  \n\nSo enemy could go UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Risk of head-on collision:\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 6), enemy cannot reach (9, 6) in one move from (8, 4) \u2192 no head-on collision possible this turn.  \nIf I go LEFT to (7, 6), enemy cannot reach (7, 6) in one move from (8, 4) \u2192 safe.  \nIf I go DOWN to (8, 5), enemy could move UP to (8, 5) \u2192 **head-on collision** \u2192 both die.  \nSo DOWN is risky if enemy chooses UP.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know enemy\u2019s move. I should avoid cells that enemy could move into unless beneficial.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Apple proximity & future options:\n- RIGHT (9, 6): gets apple immediately \u2192 grow to length 5, score 4 apples. But then head at (9, 6) next turn with body behind at (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7), (6, 7).  \n  From (9, 6) next turn: UP \u2192 (9, 7) empty, DOWN \u2192 (9, 5) empty, LEFT \u2192 (8, 6) occupied by my new body (since apple growth adds tail at old tail? Wait: growth means new tail stays where old tail was for this move, so after eating apple, new segment will be added at the tail end next turn, so (8, 6) becomes body? Let's check:  \n  Current: head (8,6), body (8,7),(7,7),(6,7)  \n  Move RIGHT to (9,6) (apple). Grow: new tail added after movement, so new body: head (9,6), then old head (8,6) becomes second segment, then (8,7), (7,7), (6,7) stays tail, new segment appears at (6,7)? No, growth means tail doesn\u2019t move this turn, so tail stays at (6,7), but a new segment will be added at the tail position at end of turn, so length increases by 1, tail still at (6,7)? Wait, that\u2019s wrong: In Snake, when you eat apple, you grow by 1 segment at the tail end next turn. So after moving to (9,6), body becomes [(9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7)] and tail still at (6,7), but next turn tail will not move (it stays at (6,7) and a new segment is added there? Actually: In simultaneous movement games, growth happens immediately: after movement, if head on apple, the tail doesn\u2019t move (so length +1). So positions: head new at (9,6), body: old head (8,6) becomes segment 2, then (8,7), (7,7), (6,7) stays tail, but tail doesn\u2019t move next turn because growth. So (6,7) is still tail, length 5.  \n\n  From (9,6) next turn: possible moves: UP (9,7) free, DOWN (9,5) free, LEFT (8,6) my own body (segment 2) \u2192 unsafe. So only UP/DOWN safe, RIGHT off board \u2192 death. So after eating apple at (9,6), I\u2019d be stuck with only 2 moves next turn, one of which is risky if enemy moves there. But still alive.\n\n- LEFT (7, 6): no apple, moves toward center, more options next turn. From (7,6), next turn can go UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT? Check: body will be [(7,6), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7)? Wait no growth, so body: head (7,6), then old head (8,6), then (8,7), then (7,7), tail (6,7)? Actually after moving LEFT to (7,6) without apple, body: [(7,6), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7)], tail (6,7) gone (since tail moves forward). So length 4 still.  \n  From (7,6): UP (7,7) my body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN (7,5) free, LEFT (6,6) free, RIGHT (8,6) my body \u2192 unsafe. So 2 safe moves next turn. Not great.\n\n- DOWN (8, 5): no apple, but risk of head-on collision if enemy goes UP. Also from (8,5), next turn: possible moves: UP back to (8,6) my body? After moving DOWN to (8,5), body: [(8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7)], tail (6,7) gone. So from (8,5): UP (8,6) my body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN (8,4) enemy head currently there but could move, LEFT (7,5) free, RIGHT (9,5) free. So 2 safe moves.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Which is best?\n- RIGHT gets apple, increases score, but slightly limits next move options (only 2 safe moves).\n- LEFT no apple, also 2 safe moves next turn.\n- DOWN risky (possible head-on collision), same 2 safe moves next turn.\n\nGiven scores tied 3\u20133, getting an apple could give lead. Eating apple at (9,6) is safe from collision this turn, and enemy can\u2019t reach it. It\u2019s safe for me now.  \n\nAlso board shows apple at (3,5) and others far. Getting (9,6) is low risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn after RIGHT:**  \nFrom (9,6), only UP/DOWN safe next turn. Choose based on enemy position then. Possibly go DOWN to (9,5) to move toward center apples later.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nRIGHT",

Check possible moves from my head (9,5):**  \n\n- **UP** \u2192 (9,6): That's my own body segment (the neck), so illegal (suicide).  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (9,4): Empty on board. Is it safe?  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (8,5): Empty on board.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 off board (x=10), illegal.  \n\nSo only DOWN and LEFT are possible.\n\n---\n\n**2. Safety check for DOWN (9,4):**  \n\nEnemy head is at (6,4).  \nEnemy possible moves from (6,4): UP (6,5), DOWN (6,3), LEFT (5,4), RIGHT (7,4) (but (7,4) is its own body, so illegal).  \n\nCould enemy move to (9,4) this turn? No, too far.  \nCould enemy move to (8,4)? Already its own body.  \nCould enemy move to (7,4)? Already its own body.  \n\nSo (9,4) is not reachable by enemy head this turn.  \nAlso, no other snake exists.  \n\nIs (9,4) in my own future body? No.  \nIs (9,4) in enemy body currently? No.  \n\nSo DOWN seems safe from immediate collision.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Safety check for LEFT (8,5):**  \n\nEnemy could move UP to (6,5) or LEFT to (5,4) or DOWN to (6,3). None reach (8,5).  \nMy own body: (8,5) is not in my body list.  \nEnemy body: (8,5) not in enemy body list.  \n\nSo LEFT also safe.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Future options after each move:**  \n\nIf I go **DOWN to (9,4)**:  \nNext turn from (9,4), possible moves: UP (back to 9,5 \u2014 my old head, will be empty unless I grow), LEFT (8,4 \u2014 enemy body segment), DOWN (9,3 \u2014 empty), RIGHT (off board).  \nSo next turn from (9,4), safe moves: UP and DOWN only (LEFT is enemy body, RIGHT off board). That\u2019s 2 options.  \n\nIf I go **LEFT to (8,5)**:  \nNext turn from (8,5), possible moves: UP (8,6 \u2014 my body), DOWN (8,4 \u2014 enemy body), LEFT (7,5 \u2014 empty), RIGHT (9,5 \u2014 empty unless I grow).  \nSo safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT only. Also 2 options.  \n\nBoth give 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Apple proximity:**  \n\nFrom (9,5):  \n- DOWN (9,4): Closer to apples? Apples at (1,4), (2,4), (1,1), (3,5), (0,5).  \n  Manhattan distance to (1,4) from (9,4) = |9-1| + |4-4| = 8.  \n  From (8,5) to (1,4) = |8-1| + |5-4| = 7+1=8.  \n  Same distance to that apple.  \n\nFrom (8,5) to (3,5) = 5 steps.  \nFrom (9,4) to (3,5) = |9-3| + |4-5| = 6+1=7. So LEFT is slightly closer to (3,5).  \n\nBut (3,5) is the nearest apple in steps? Let's check distances from both:  \n\nFrom (9,5): to (3,5) = 6 steps.  \nFrom (9,4): to (3,5) = 7 steps.  \nFrom (8,5): to (3,5) = 5 steps.  \n\nSo LEFT puts me closer to apple (3,5).  \n\n---\n\n**6. Enemy threat next turn:**  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,5), enemy at (6,4) could move UP to (6,5), which is 2 away from (8,5). No direct threat.  \nIf I go DOWN to (9,4), enemy at (6,4) could move DOWN to (6,3) or LEFT to (5,4), not threatening me.  \n\nBoth safe.  \n\n---\n\n**7. Long-term planning:**  \n\nThe enemy is shorter (length 4 vs my 5).  \nIf we meet head-on, I win if lengths are equal, but here I\u2019m longer so I survive if we go into same cell (they die, I live). But I\u2019d rather avoid that risk entirely.  \n\nI want to collect apples on left side: (3,5) is reachable in 5 moves from (8,5).  \nFrom (9,4), I\u2019d have to go left through (8,4) which is currently enemy body \u2014 but enemy will move, so maybe free later.  \n\nGiven enemy is at (6,4), moving LEFT now toward (3,5) seems good.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nMove LEFT to (8,5). Next turn, from (8,5), assess if LEFT (7,5) or RIGHT (9,5) is safer. Likely go LEFT toward apple (3,5), watching enemy movement. Avoid moving into (8,4) or (7,4) while enemy slithers.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Enemy possible moves: UP (6,6), DOWN (6,4) (enemy body), LEFT (5,5), RIGHT (7,5).  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (7,5) same time I move LEFT to (7,5), head-on collision \u2192 both die. But enemy length 4, my length 5 \u2192 if lengths differ, only the shorter dies? Wait, rules: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die (head-on collision).\" So regardless of length, head-on collision kills both.  \nThus (7,5) is risky if enemy moves RIGHT.  \n\nBut I have no other choice \u2014 all other moves are illegal. So I must accept the risk.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Likelihood enemy moves RIGHT:**  \n\nFrom enemy head (6,5):  \n- UP (6,6): empty.  \n- DOWN (6,4): enemy's own body (second segment).  \n- LEFT (5,5): empty.  \n- RIGHT (7,5): empty (but I might move there).  \n\nEnemy will avoid suicide: DOWN is illegal. So enemy's safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \nEnemy might avoid moving into my possible future positions unpredictably, but they don't know my move.  \nThey might see apple at (3,5) and move LEFT toward it, or move UP, or move RIGHT randomly.  \nProbability they move RIGHT = 1/3 of safe moves.  \n\nIf they move RIGHT, we collide and both die. That would end game with my apples 4, enemy apples 3 \u2192 I win? But game ends immediately with more apples winning. Yes, so head-on collision here means I win (4 > 3).  \n\nThat\u2019s actually acceptable \u2014 I win immediately.  \n\n---\n\n**4. What if enemy doesn\u2019t move RIGHT:**  \n\nIf enemy moves UP or LEFT, I survive to (7,5). Then next turn my head at (7,5), body: [(8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,7)] length 5.  \n\nFrom (7,5) next turn possible moves:  \n- UP (7,6): empty  \n- DOWN (7,4): enemy body (third segment? Let's check: enemy body: [(6,4), (7,4), (8,4)] \u2192 yes (7,4) is enemy body)  \n- LEFT (6,5): enemy head current position, but enemy will have moved, so (6,5) empty unless enemy moves back? Possibly empty.  \n- RIGHT (8,5): my own body (second segment next turn).  \n\nSo next turn from (7,5), safe moves likely UP and LEFT. That keeps options open.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \n\nIf alive at (7,5):  \n- Check enemy\u2019s new head position.  \n- Aim for apple (3,5) via LEFT moves if safe.  \n- Avoid trapping myself.  \n\n---\n\nSince only LEFT is legal, and it either wins immediately (if enemy moves RIGHT) or keeps me alive (if enemy moves elsewhere), I must choose LEFT.  \n\nLEFT",

Enemy\u2019s possible moves:  \n- UP (5,6) empty  \n- DOWN (5,4) empty  \n- LEFT (4,5) empty  \n- RIGHT (6,5) enemy\u2019s own body segment \u2192 illegal.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\nCould enemy move to (7,6) this turn? No \u2014 they can\u2019t reach it from (5,5) in one move.  \n\nCould enemy move into a cell that becomes dangerous for me next turn? Not relevant for immediate safety.  \n\nSo (7,6) is safe from collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Future planning from (7,6):**  \n\nFrom (7,6) next turn, possible moves:  \n- UP (7,7): empty  \n- DOWN (7,5): empty (my old head position)  \n- LEFT (6,6): empty  \n- RIGHT (8,6): my own body (last segment currently at (8,6), but after this turn my body will shift: new body will be [(7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6)], so (8,6) becomes empty) \u2014 wait, let\u2019s trace:  \n\nIf I move UP to (7,6):  \nNew head = (7,6)  \nBody becomes: old head (7,5) + old body minus tail? No \u2014 I didn\u2019t eat an apple, so length stays same: new body = [(7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6)]. Tail (8,6) disappears.  \n\nSo (8,6) is empty next turn.  \n\nThus from (7,6) next turn, all four directions might be free unless enemy moves into them.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Apples:**  \nClosest apples: (3,5) is 4 left from my head now, but unreachable this turn due to enemy in between. From (7,6), apples at (3,5) and (1,4), (2,4), (0,5), (1,1) are all far left/down.  \n\nI can plan to go left next turn if enemy moves away from (6,5).  \n\n---\n\n**5. Risk of head-on collision in future:**  \n\nEnemy might move UP to (5,6) or DOWN to (5,4) or LEFT to (4,5). If enemy goes LEFT, they get closer to apple (3,5).  \n\nIf I go UP now, I\u2019m away from enemy\u2019s possible immediate path, reducing collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Only one legal move:**  \n\nSince DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are illegal, only UP is possible.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7,6), check enemy\u2019s new head position. Consider moving LEFT towards apple (3,5) if safe, or UP/DOWN to avoid being trapped. Keep space from enemy.  \n\nUP",

Keep options open:**\n\nUP (7, 7) gives more open space above.  \nLEFT (6, 6) is safe now but reduces future moves if enemy moves toward (5, 5) or (4, 6).  \nRIGHT (8, 6) leads toward right wall, which could trap me later.\n\nUP seems best for maintaining space.\n\n---\n\n**7. Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 7), check enemy\u2019s new head. Consider moving toward left side apples via (6, 7) or (7, 6) later, but avoid boxing self in top row.

Future safety and apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple to me: (7,3) is 4 steps down. But going down from (7,7) is illegal now (own body at (7,6)).  \nNext closest: (0,5), (1,4), (2,4), (1,1) are far left/down.  \n\nEnemy is at (3,5), close to apples at (1,4),(2,4),(0,5). They will likely move toward those.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (6,7), I could next move DOWN/LEFT toward apples but will be behind enemy\u2019s current position. Might still reach apples later if enemy moves away.  \n\nIf I go UP to (7,8), I move away from apples but stay safe in open area.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,7), I move toward right wall, fewer apples there.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Future move options:**  \nFrom (7,8): next turn possible moves: UP(7,9), LEFT(6,8), RIGHT(8,8), DOWN(7,7) \u2014 all likely open except maybe (7,7) if my body moves.  \n\nFrom (6,7): next turn possible moves: UP(6,8), DOWN(6,6), LEFT(5,7), RIGHT(7,7). (6,6) is empty now.  \n\nFrom (8,7): next turn possible moves: UP(8,8), DOWN(8,6), LEFT(7,7), RIGHT(9,7). (8,6) empty, (9,7) empty.  \n\nAll have reasonable options, but going UP gives more central flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term:**  \nEnemy is length 8, I am length 5. Need apples to catch up. But must avoid risky head-on collisions \u2014 enemy longer so they\u2019d win tie.  \n\nBetter to take safe moves toward apples when possible. Right now, going LEFT gets me closer to apple cluster at left side, but enemy is already there. Might try to loop around via top-left later.  \n\nGiven enemy at (3,5), if they move LEFT to (2,5) or DOWN to (3,4), they\u2019ll be closer to (1,4),(2,4). I can\u2019t beat them to those apples from here. Apple at (7,3) is closer vertically but blocked by my own body currently.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (7,8), next turn consider going LEFT to (6,8) then DOWN to (6,7) etc., to approach (7,3) apple once my tail moves. My tail is at (9,5), will take a few turns to clear bottom right.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP keeps me safe, open, and lets me reposition toward apples next turn without rushing into enemy territory.  \n\nUP",

Possible moves from (6, 8):**  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 9) \u2013 within board, empty now.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 7) \u2013 within board, currently empty (my body at (7,7) is not same cell).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 8) \u2013 within board, empty now.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 8) \u2013 within board, but that\u2019s my own body segment (immediately behind head), so death.  \n\nSo RIGHT is invalid (hits own body).  \n\n---\n\n**2. Check for immediate enemy body collisions:**  \nEnemy body cells: (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5) \u2014 none of my possible moves land there.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Check for head-on collisions:**  \nEnemy head at (1, 5). Possible enemy moves:  \nFrom (1, 5): UP (1, 6), DOWN (1, 4), LEFT (0, 5), RIGHT (2, 5).  \n\nMy possible moves:  \n- UP (6, 9): far from enemy possible moves \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (6, 7): far from enemy possible moves \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT (5, 8): far from enemy possible moves \u2192 safe.  \n\nNo overlap.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Apples proximity:**  \nClosest apples to (6, 8):  \n(7, 3) is far, (0, 5) far, (1, 4) far, (2, 4) far, (1, 1) far.  \nBut (7, 3) is below and left relative to head? Actually (7, 3) is to the right (x+1) and down (y-5).  \nFrom (6, 8), moving DOWN gets closer in y, moving LEFT gets closer in x? Actually (7, 3) is x=7, y=3. From (6, 8): dx = +1, dy = -5. So to get closer, need to go RIGHT and DOWN. But RIGHT is illegal.  \n\n(0, 5) is dx = -6, dy = -3.  \n(1, 4) dx = -5, dy = -4.  \n(2, 4) dx = -4, dy = -4.  \nSo LEFT + DOWN direction helps for those apples.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Future mobility:**  \nFrom (6, 8):  \n- UP (6, 9): then possible moves from there: left (5, 9), down (6, 8) (occupied by my tail next turn? Tail at (7, 5), head moving to (6, 8) this turn? Wait\u2014body is [(7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5)]. If I move head to (6, 8), new body becomes [(6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5)], but tail stays (7,5) unless I eat an apple. I\u2019m not eating an apple this turn, so tail stays. So next turn, (6, 8) is occupied by my neck, so from (6, 9), down would be into my neck \u2192 invalid. So from (6, 9), only UP, LEFT, RIGHT possible? Let\u2019s check:  \nFrom (6, 9): UP off board, DOWN to (6, 8) my neck next turn, so invalid. LEFT (5, 9) free, RIGHT (7, 9) free. So 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n- DOWN (6, 7): From (6, 7): next turn, body will be [(6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6)], tail (7,6). Check moves from (6, 7): UP to (6, 8) my neck \u2192 invalid. DOWN (6, 6) free, LEFT (5, 7) free, RIGHT (7, 7) my body? (7, 7) is in next body? Yes, (7, 7) is third segment. So invalid. So DOWN and LEFT only \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\n- LEFT (5, 8): From (5, 8): next turn body: [(5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6)], tail (7,6). Moves: UP (5, 9) free, DOWN (5, 7) free, LEFT (4, 8) free, RIGHT (6, 8) my neck \u2192 invalid. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nSo LEFT gives best future mobility (3 options).  \n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term plan note:**  \nWe\u2019re tied at 4 apples with enemy. Need to target apples safely. Enemy is on left side near apples (1,4), (2,4), (0,5). Might go for those. I should maybe go towards (7, 3) apple but need to go around because body blocks rightward from head now. Next turn from (5, 8) can go DOWN towards (7, 3) area.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** LEFT gives best mobility and starts moving toward left-side apples while avoiding trap.  \n\nLEFT",

Check other snakes' bodies: enemy body is at (5,5) which is not (5,6). So safe unless enemy head moves there.  \n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (4, 7) \u2192 empty, safe? Check enemy body: none at (4,7).  \n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 7) \u2192 empty, safe? Check enemy body: none at (6,7).  \n\n**Eliminate obviously deadly moves:**  \nUP is out (into own body). DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT seem viable for immediate self-collision/off-board check.  \n\n**Check board edges:**  \nDOWN: (5,6) inside board (y from 0 to 9).  \nLEFT: (4,7) inside board.  \nRIGHT: (6,7) inside board.  \n\nNow consider **enemy snake\u2019s possible moves** from (2,4) to avoid head-on collisions or enemy moving into my target cell.  \n\nEnemy head at (2,4), body: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5)].  \nEnemy possible moves:  \n- UP to (2,5) \u2192 occupied by its own body \u2192 death \u2192 unlikely enemy picks.  \n- DOWN to (2,3) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT to (1,4) \u2192 occupied by its own body \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT to (3,4) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo enemy likely moves: DOWN or RIGHT.  \n\nMy possible target cells:  \nDOWN: (5,6) \u2014 enemy at (2,4) can\u2019t reach (5,6) in 1 move. Safe from head-on.  \nLEFT: (4,7) \u2014 enemy can\u2019t reach in 1 move.  \nRIGHT: (6,7) \u2014 enemy can\u2019t reach in 1 move.  \n\nSo all three moves safe from head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**Next: apple proximity.**  \nApples: (1,1), (0,5), (7,3), (6,3), (8,6).  \n\nFrom (5,7):  \n- To (7,3): distance 4 in x + 4 in y = 8 steps.  \n- To (6,3): distance 1 in x + 4 in y = 5 steps.  \n- To (8,6): distance 3 in x + 1 in y = 4 steps.  \n- To (0,5): far.  \n- To (1,1): far.  \n\nClosest apples: (8,6) and (6,3).  \n\nRIGHT to (6,7) gets closer to (8,6) (now 2 steps away horizontally, 1 vertically \u2192 3 total).  \nDOWN to (5,6) gets a bit closer to (6,3) but not much.  \n\n**Future mobility check:**  \nFrom (5,6): possible moves next turn: UP back to (5,7) (body will have moved?), LEFT to (4,6), RIGHT to (6,6), DOWN to (5,5) \u2014 but (5,5) is enemy body now, but next turn enemy moves so maybe safe? But risky.  \n\nFrom (4,7): next turn options: UP to (4,8) (free?), DOWN to (4,6), LEFT to (3,7), RIGHT to (5,7) (body segment there next turn? Let's simulate.)  \n\nAfter my move, my body will shift: new head at new position, tail at (7,7) disappears if no apple eaten. Body becomes: [new head, (5,7), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8)] \u2014 tail (7,7) gone.  \n\nSo from (4,7): UP (4,8) free? Currently free. DOWN (4,6) free. LEFT (3,7) free. RIGHT (5,7) occupied by my old head (now second segment) \u2192 so not safe next turn if RIGHT from (4,7).  \n\nFrom (6,7): next turn options: UP (6,8) occupied by my body segment? After move, body: [ (6,7), (5,7), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8) ]. So (6,8) is my 4th segment \u2192 not safe to move into. DOWN (6,6) free. LEFT (5,7) occupied by my 2nd segment \u2192 not safe. RIGHT (7,7) free.  \n\nSo from (6,7), only DOWN and RIGHT safe next turn (two options).  \nFrom (5,6), only UP, LEFT, RIGHT safe next turn (three options).  \nFrom (4,7), only UP, DOWN, LEFT safe next turn (three options).  \n\nAll have decent mobility.  \n\nBut (6,7) is closest to apple (8,6), which is also away from enemy. Enemy is far bottom-left.  \n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nEnemy longer, might try to cut me off later. I should go for apples near top-right while keeping space. Avoid moving toward enemy until necessary.  \n\nGiven all, best move: **RIGHT** toward (8,6) apple.  \n\nRIGHT",

No, tail gone, so empty.  \n- DOWN to (7,6): empty.  \n- LEFT to (6,7): occupied by my body (segment 2) \u2192 not safe.  \n- RIGHT to (8,7): empty.  \n\nSo from (7,7), safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nIf I move DOWN to (6,6): next turn body = [(6,6), (6,7), (5,7), (5,8), (6,8)].  \nFrom (6,6) possible moves:  \n- UP to (6,7): occupied by my body \u2192 not safe.  \n- DOWN to (6,5): empty.  \n- LEFT to (5,6): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (7,6): empty.  \n\nSo from (6,6), safe moves next turn: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nBoth have 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is at (2,3) far away, apples at (8,6) and (7,3)/(6,3) are closer. Going RIGHT gets me slightly closer to (8,6) and keeps me near top-right apples. DOWN gets me closer to (6,3) but that\u2019s also near enemy\u2019s area eventually. I think RIGHT is better because it keeps me away from enemy and closer to (8,6) apple with similar mobility.  \n\nAlso note: from (7,7), I can go UP to (7,8) then possibly RIGHT to (8,8) then DOWN to (8,7) or (8,6) for apple.  \n\n**Decision:** RIGHT.  \n\nRIGHT",

LEFT (1,1) \u2192 apple, no my body there, safe for them. RIGHT (3,1) \u2192 empty, safe. DOWN (2,0) \u2192 empty, safe.  \n\nEnemy could move to (1,1) apple, or (3,1), or (2,0). None threaten my immediate moves' destinations except possibly if they move toward me, but they're far away (distance 5+). No head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Safe moves:** DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n- RIGHT: (8,6) apple adjacent \u2192 eat apple and grow.  \n- DOWN: (7,5) \u2192 not apple.  \n- LEFT: (6,6) \u2192 not apple.  \n\nEating apple is good for score (currently 4 vs enemy 6). But eating means growing by 1 segment next turn, which reduces future mobility slightly, but still worth it unless it leads to immediate danger next turn.  \n\nCheck next turn after RIGHT (eating apple at (8,6)):  \nNew head at (8,6), new body adds segment at old head (7,6) after movement, so body will be: [(8,6), (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,8)] length 6.  \n\nFrom (8,6) next turn: possible moves: UP (8,7) empty, DOWN (8,5) empty, LEFT (7,6) own new body segment (since growth adds segment at old head (7,6)), so LEFT would be suicide. RIGHT (9,6) empty but board edge (x=9 valid, x=10 invalid). So RIGHT would be off-board next turn? Wait, x=9 is last column, so RIGHT from (8,6) \u2192 (9,6) is valid. Then from (9,6) next turn if I go RIGHT again? That would be off-board, but I don't need to think that far.  \n\nActually, immediate next turn from (8,6):  \nUP (8,7) safe.  \nDOWN (8,5) safe.  \nLEFT (7,6) unsafe (my own new body).  \nRIGHT (9,6) safe. So 3 safe moves. That's fine.  \n\n---\n\n**LEFT move** from (7,6) \u2192 (6,6):  \nFrom (6,6) next turn: possible moves: UP (6,7) my body, unsafe. DOWN (6,5) safe. LEFT (5,6) safe. RIGHT (7,6) safe (empty then). So 3 safe moves.  \n\n**DOWN move** from (7,6) \u2192 (7,5):  \nFrom (7,5) next turn: UP (7,6) safe (empty then), DOWN (7,4) safe, LEFT (6,5) safe, RIGHT (8,5) safe. All 4 safe.  \n\nSo DOWN keeps most mobility next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Risk of enemy reaching my area?** Enemy is at (2,1), apples at (1,1) and (0,5) closer to them. They'll likely go for (1,1) apple. They won't reach me soon.  \n\n---\n\n**Strategy:**  \nShort-term: Eat apples to catch up in score (4 vs 6). But also avoid trapping myself. Eating (8,6) now gives +1 apple, but next turn from (8,6) my left is blocked by my new body. Still manageable.  \n\nAlternatively, go DOWN to (7,5), then next turn possibly eat (7,3) or (6,3) apples while keeping more space. But (7,3) is 2 steps down, (6,3) is 2 steps down+left.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT and eat (8,6), I'm at top-right edge, which could limit future moves if I'm not careful. But board is open there now.  \n\nGiven enemy score lead, I should prioritize closing apple gap. So eating (8,6) now is good.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (8,6), head at (8,6), body length 6. Next turn avoid LEFT into (7,6) (own body). Prefer DOWN to (8,5) or UP to (8,7) to stay near remaining apples (7,3),(6,3) and away from enemy. Enemy likely still in lower left.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** RIGHT to eat apple and gain score safely.  \n\nRIGHT",

Actually, apples collected was 5 before last turn, now still 5? The board shows my head at (8,6) now, body: [(7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,8)] \u2014 that's 5 body segments, total length 6. Yes. Apples collected: 5 (unchanged from last turn's state? But I ate an apple last move, so maybe the apples collected hasn't updated yet? Actually, turn 23 now, last turn I moved RIGHT onto (8,6) which had an apple. So now my apples should be 6? But \"Apples collected: 5\" is still listed \u2014 maybe it's not updated in the text but board shows apple at (8,6) is gone? Board shows '1' at (8,6) (my head), apple was at (8,6) in previous turn's apple list, but current apple list: (0,5), (7,3), (6,3), (3,0), (5,4) \u2014 no (8,6), so I did eat it. So my score should be 6 apples now, but the text says \"Apples collected: 5\" \u2014 possibly a lag in update, but logically I have 6 now.  \n\n**Apples:** (0,5), (7,3), (6,3), (3,0), (5,4)  \n\n**Enemy snake #0:**  \nHead: (1,1)  \nBody: [(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]  \nLength: 8 (head + 7 body segments)  \n\n---\n\n**Possible moves from my head (8,6):**  \n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (8,7) \u2192 empty on board (board shows '.' at (8,7) in row 7 col 8).  \n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (8,5) \u2192 empty.  \n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 my own body segment (second segment) \u2192 deadly.  \n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,6) \u2192 empty, valid coordinate.  \n\nSo immediately unsafe: LEFT into (7,6).  \n\n---\n\n**Check enemy possible moves from (1,1):**  \nEnemy moves: UP (1,2) empty, DOWN (1,0) empty, LEFT (0,1) empty, RIGHT (2,1) own body. So they have UP, DOWN, LEFT safe. They might go for apple at (0,5) via multiple moves, or (3,0) etc.  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk because distance > 1.  \n\n---\n\n**Safe moves for me:** UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n- UP (8,7): no apple nearby.  \n- DOWN (8,5): closer to apples (7,3) and (6,3) \u2014 2 steps down then left/down.  \n- RIGHT (9,6): far from apples, puts me on right edge.  \n\n---\n\n**Next turn mobility:**  \nIf I go UP to (8,7):  \nFrom (8,7) next turn: UP (8,8) empty, DOWN (8,6) my body (old head location after move? Wait, after I move to (8,7), my body becomes: [(8,7), (8,6), (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,8)] length 7? No, growth already happened last turn, so length is 6 now, moving without eating apple means length stays 6: new head at (8,7), tail (5,8) removed? Actually, if I don't eat apple this turn, my tail moves: old body (8,6), (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (5,8) \u2192 move head to (8,7), add (8,7) to front, remove tail (5,8). So new body: [(8,7), (8,6), (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)].  \nThen from (8,7) possible moves: UP (8,8) empty, DOWN (8,6) own body (second segment), LEFT (7,7) own body, RIGHT (9,7) empty. So only UP and RIGHT safe. Limited.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,5):  \nNew body: [(8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)] (tail (5,8) removed).  \nFrom (8,5): UP (8,6) own body, DOWN (8,4) empty, LEFT (7,5) empty, RIGHT (9,5) empty. So 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Better.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,6):  \nNew body: [(9,6), (8,6), (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)] (tail removed).  \nFrom (9,6): UP (9,7) empty, DOWN (9,5) empty, LEFT (8,6) own body, RIGHT off-board. So 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN). Worse.  \n\n---\n\n**Strategic note:**  \nEnemy has 7 apples, I have 6 (assuming updated). Gap: 1 apple. Need to catch up. Apples nearby: (7,3), (6,3), (5,4) are closest to me. (0,5) and (3,0) closer to enemy.  \n\nFrom (8,5), I can go LEFT to (7,5) then DOWN toward (7,3).  \nFrom (8,7), I'm moving away from apples.  \nFrom (9,6), far from apples.  \n\nSo DOWN seems best for both mobility and apple access.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nMove DOWN to (8,5). Next turn, consider moving LEFT to (7,5) then DOWN to (7,4) \u2192 (7,3) apple in 2 turns, or go DOWN twice to (8,3) then LEFT to (7,3). Keep options open. Avoid trapping near enemy who is far away for now.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Check possible moves from (8,4)  \n- **UP**: (8,5) \u2192 occupied by your own body segment (first body part after head). Not safe.  \n- **DOWN**: (8,3) \u2192 empty on board (board shows nothing at (8,3)), within bounds. Safe? Let\u2019s check enemy body: enemy body at (1,4),(2,4) etc., not here.  \n- **LEFT**: (7,4) \u2192 empty on board (board shows only your head at (8,4), nothing at (7,4)).  \n- **RIGHT**: (9,4) \u2192 within bounds, empty on board.  \n\nSo UP is unsafe (into own body). DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are *potentially* safe from immediate self-collision and in bounds.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Check enemy head possible moves and possible head-on collisions  \nEnemy head at (0,2).  \nIts possible moves:  \n- UP: (0,3) \u2013 empty on board.  \n- DOWN: (0,1) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT: (-1,2) \u2192 out of bounds (die).  \n- RIGHT: (1,2) \u2192 occupied by its own body (first body segment after head).  \n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN.  \n\nFrom (0,2), neither UP nor DOWN can reach (7,4), (8,3), or (9,4) in one move, so no possible head-on collision with any of my safe moves this turn.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Check moving into enemy body  \nEnemy body coordinates: [(1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (1,4)]  \n\nMy safe moves:  \n- DOWN to (8,3): not in enemy body list \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT to (7,4): not in enemy body list \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT to (9,4): not in enemy body list \u2192 safe.  \n\nAll three are safe from enemy body collision.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Check moving into my own body next turn  \nThis is about immediate danger only, but also future safety.  \nLet\u2019s simulate each move\u2019s new head position and see if it reduces options next turn.  \n\n**DOWN to (8,3):**  \nNew head: (8,3)  \nBody becomes: [(8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (7,7)] (tail (6,7) disappears unless we eat apple).  \nNo apple at (8,3), so length stays 6, tail moves away.  \n\nFrom (8,3), possible moves next turn:  \n- UP: back to (8,4) \u2013 occupied by my body segment? Wait, next turn body segments shift:  \nBody after moving DOWN without eating:  \nPositions: head=(8,3), segment2=(8,4), segment3=(8,5), segment4=(8,6), segment5=(7,6), segment6=(7,7), tail gone.  \nSo UP to (8,4) is occupied (by my own 2nd segment). Not safe next turn.  \n- DOWN: (8,2) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT: (7,3) \u2013 apple there! Could eat next turn if still there.  \n- RIGHT: (9,3) \u2013 empty.  \nSo from (8,3), 3 safe moves next turn (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n**LEFT to (7,4):**  \nNew head: (7,4)  \nBody: [(7,4), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (7,7)] (tail gone).  \nFrom (7,4) next turn:  \n- UP: (7,5) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN: (7,3) \u2013 apple there.  \n- LEFT: (6,4) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT: (8,4) \u2013 occupied by my body (2nd segment).  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**RIGHT to (9,4):**  \nNew head: (9,4)  \nBody: [(9,4), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (7,6), (7,7)]  \nFrom (9,4) next turn:  \n- UP: (9,5) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN: (9,3) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT: (8,4) \u2013 occupied by my body.  \n- RIGHT: out of bounds \u2192 die.  \nSo only 2 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN). Worse.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Apple proximity  \nApples: (0,5) far, (7,3) close, (6,3) close, (3,0) far, (5,4) close-ish.  \n\nFrom (8,4):  \n- DOWN to (8,3): distance to (7,3) = 2 steps away (1 left, 1 down).  \n- LEFT to (7,4): distance to (7,3) = 1 step down next turn.  \n- RIGHT to (9,4): far from apples.  \n\nSo DOWN and LEFT both move toward apple at (7,3).  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Which is safer long-term?  \nEnemy snake is far away (head at (0,2)), so immediate collision unlikely for a couple turns.  \n\nLEFT to (7,4): puts me closer to apple (7,3) but also closer to enemy territory? Not really.  \nDOWN to (8,3): also close to apple (7,3).  \n\nBut check: If I go LEFT to (7,4), next turn I can go DOWN to eat apple (7,3). That\u2019s fine.  \nIf I go DOWN to (8,3), next turn I can go LEFT to eat apple (7,3).  \n\nBoth equivalent in steps to apple.  \n\nBut going LEFT now to (7,4) means my body occupies (8,4),(8,5), etc. That might block my path later if I want to go up from (7,4) later. Actually, from (7,4) going up is safe next turn to (7,5).  \n\nGoing DOWN to (8,3) means my body occupies (8,4) etc. That might block me from going back up from (8,3) next turn (since UP to (8,4) is occupied). So DOWN reduces future options slightly more than LEFT does.  \n\nLEFT seems slightly better: from (7,4) next turn, I have UP, DOWN, LEFT safe; RIGHT blocked by own body but that\u2019s fine.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7,4), apple at (7,3) is below me. If still there, DOWN to eat it. If not, consider path toward (5,4) or (6,3). Avoid moving toward enemy head area unless necessary. Keep space open.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Current head position:**  \nMy snake (ID 1) head at (7, 3).  \nBody: [(7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7)] \u2192 length 7 segments (head + 6 body parts).\n\n**2. Apples:** (0, 5), (6, 3), (3, 0), (5, 4), (6, 6).\n\n**3. Enemy snake #0:**  \nHead at (0, 4), body: [(0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)] \u2192 length 8 segments.\n\n---\n\n**Possible moves from (7, 3):**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (7, 4) \u2192 occupied by my own body \u2192 **illegal** (self-collision).\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (7, 2) \u2192 empty on board? Board shows (7, 2) is `.` \u2192 safe from immediate collision? Check enemy body: (7, 2) not in enemy body list. Check my body: not in my body list. On board? Yes.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (6, 3) \u2192 apple at (6, 3) \u2192 would eat apple \u2192 but check: is (6, 3) occupied by any snake body? Board shows `T` at (6, 3)? Wait, looking at board row 3:  \nRow 3: `T . T . . . A 1 . .`  \nCoordinates: x=0..9. So row y=3:  \nx=0: T (enemy tail), x=1: ., x=2: T, x=3: ., x=4: ., x=5: ., x=6: A (apple), x=7: 1 (my head), x=8: ., x=9: .  \nSo (6, 3) is `A`, not occupied by any snake body. That means LEFT to (6, 3) is safe (no enemy body there, not my body).\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8, 3) \u2192 board shows `.` at (8, 3) \u2192 empty, no apple, safe.\n\n---\n\n**Check for collisions with enemy head movement:**  \nEnemy head at (0, 4). Their possible moves: UP to (0, 5) apple, DOWN to (0, 3) occupied by their own body (illegal for them), LEFT off board (illegal), RIGHT to (1, 4) empty.  \nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP or RIGHT.  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (1, 4), that\u2019s far from my possible moves.  \nIf enemy moves UP to (0, 5), also far.\n\nNo possible head-on collision with me this turn because I\u2019m at (7, 3), enemy at (0, 4).  \n\n---\n\n**Check safety of my moves:**  \nUP \u2192 (7, 4) \u2192 my body \u2192 illegal.  \nDOWN \u2192 (7, 2) \u2192 safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (6, 3) \u2192 safe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (8, 3) \u2192 safe.\n\nSo three legal moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Strategic considerations:**  \n\n- Eating apples: LEFT gets apple at (6, 3), grows to length 8, enemy length 8 too (they have 7 apples, I have 6; after eating I\u2019d have 7 apples, still 1 behind).  \n- Future mobility: If I go LEFT to (6, 3), next turn my head at (6, 3), body adds segment at old head (7, 3), so tail still at (7, 7)? Wait, growth: new head at apple, old body stays, new segment added at tail? Actually in Snake: when you eat apple, you grow by not removing tail next move. So after moving LEFT to (6, 3), my body becomes: head (6, 3), then old head (7, 3) becomes new neck, then (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7) \u2192 length 8.  \n\nCheck immediate next turn options from (6, 3):  \nUP \u2192 (6, 4) empty? Board shows (6, 4) = `A`? Actually apple at (5, 4) and (6, 6), not (6, 4). Board row 4: `0 . . . . A . T T .` \u2192 x=6 is `.`. So UP safe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (6, 2) empty? Row 2: `T T T . . . . . . .` \u2192 x=6 is `.`. Safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (5, 3) empty? Row 3: x=5 is `.`. Safe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7, 3) will be my body next turn (old head becomes neck) \u2192 so illegal. So from (6, 3), RIGHT is blocked, but UP, DOWN, LEFT open \u2192 3 options.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 2): next turn from (7, 2):  \nUP \u2192 back to (7, 3) which will be empty? Wait, if I move DOWN, my body shifts: head to (7, 2), neck (7, 3), then (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7). Tail (7, 7) removed if no apple eaten. So (7, 3) is my neck, not free to move into. Actually moving UP from (7, 2) goes to (7, 3) which is my neck \u2192 illegal (self-collision). So UP not safe next turn.  \nLEFT \u2192 (6, 2) empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (8, 2) empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (7, 1) empty. So 3 options too.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 3): from (8, 3) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 (8, 4) my body \u2192 illegal.  \nDOWN \u2192 (8, 2) empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (7, 3) my neck \u2192 illegal.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9, 3) empty. So only 2 options.  \n\nSo RIGHT reduces future options more.\n\n---\n\n**Apple reachability:**  \nLEFT gets apple now. DOWN and RIGHT don\u2019t get apple this turn.  \nBut getting apple increases length, might reduce mobility slightly but not yet dangerous.\n\nEnemy is at (0, 4) with 7 apples, I have 6. Catching up in apples is good.  \n\nAlso, apple at (6, 3) is close. Apple at (5, 4) and (6, 6) also nearby after eating (6, 3).  \n\n---\n\n**Avoiding dead ends:**  \nMy current body blocks north from my head (7, 4 occupied). Going LEFT to apple seems safe and keeps options.  \n\nCheck if (6, 3) could be dangerous if enemy moves there? No, enemy too far.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nEat (6, 3), then maybe go for (5, 4) or (6, 6) depending on safety. Keep away from enemy who is longer.  \n\n---\n\n**Final decision:**  \nLEFT to (6, 3) to eat apple and keep future options open.  \n\nLEFT",

Wait, my body will move forward, so (7,7) will be empty next turn? Let\u2019s simulate:  \nMy current body: head at (7,7), then (7,6), (6,6), \u2026 tail at (7,4). If I move UP to (7,8), body becomes [(7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6), \u2026 tail at (5,4) after shifting? Actually, no growth unless eating apple. So tail (7,4) disappears, all segments shift forward. So (7,7) becomes my neck, occupied next turn. So DOWN from (7,8) would be illegal next turn.  \nFrom (7, 8): UP\u2192(7,9) empty, DOWN\u2192(7,7) my body (illegal), LEFT\u2192(6,8) empty, RIGHT\u2192(8,8) apple.

Actually eating apple is safe unless enemy also moves there simultaneously\u2014enemy can\u2019t reach (8,8) next turn from (2,9) or (4,9) in 1 step? From (2,9) to (8,8) requires 6 steps horizontally, impossible.

So only 2 safe moves next turn.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (8, 7):**  \nFrom (8, 7): UP\u2192(8,8) apple, DOWN\u2192(8,6) empty, LEFT\u2192(7,7) my body (illegal), RIGHT\u2192(9,7) empty. So 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Risk assessment:**  \nLEFT gives only 2 safe moves next turn, reducing options. UP and RIGHT give 3 safe moves next turn and progress toward apple (8,8).\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nAim for (8, 8) apple next turn. After eating it, growth will extend my body, so be careful not to trap myself afterward. Enemy is far away, so immediate threat low. Keep moving toward apples while maintaining mobility.\n\n---\n\nUP",

Possible moves from (8,8):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (8,9) \u2014 check: within board? Yes (y=9 valid). Occupied? Board shows \u2018T\u2019 at (8,9)? Wait \u2014 looking at the board diagram: row 9 col 8 is \u2018.\u2019 (empty). Actually let\u2019s check carefully:  \nRow 9 (top row): `9 . . T T . . . . . .` \u2192 col 8 is index 8 \u2192 yes \u2018.\u2019 empty.  \nNo snake body there. Enemy snake #0 body? Snake #0 body: [(2,9), (3,9), (3,8), \u2026] \u2014 so (8,9) safe.  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,8) \u2014 board row 8 col 9: `8 . . 0 T . . . T 1 .` \u2192 col 9 is \u2018.\u2019? Wait, last char in row 8 string: `8 . . 0 T . . . T 1 .` \u2014 that\u2019s 10 columns: index 0\u20139. Let\u2019s parse:  \nRow 8: col0 `.`, col1 `.`, col2 `.`, col3 `0`, col4 `T`, col5 `.`, col6 `.`, col7 `.`, col8 `T`, col9 `1` \u2014 so (9,8) is \u20181\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s **my own head currently**?? No, my head is at (8,8) now. So (9,8) is \u20181\u2019 \u2014 means my own body? Wait, my body list: head (8,8), then (7,8), (7,7), \u2026 no (9,8) not in my body. That \u20181\u2019 in the board at (9,8) must be my head\u2019s current position? But my head is at (8,8) which is \u2018T\u2019? Let\u2019s check: Row 8 col 8 is \u2018T\u2019 in diagram \u2014 yes, that\u2019s my head symbol? Actually \u2018T\u2019 means tail segment of some snake? But my head should be \u20181\u2019. Confusion.  \nLet\u2019s trust coordinates: my head at (8,8). Enemy snake head at (2,8) marked \u20180\u2019. So (9,8) is empty in reality? Let\u2019s manually check enemy body: Snake #0 body includes (3,8) etc. Not (9,8). My body: not (9,8). So (9,8) is empty. But going RIGHT from (8,8) \u2192 (9,8) is within board (x=9 valid). So RIGHT is safe.\n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8,7) \u2014 board row 7 col 8: `7 . T T T . . A T . .` \u2192 col 8 is \u2018T\u2019? That\u2019s (8,7) \u2014 \u2018T\u2019 means tail segment of some snake. Whose tail? Snake #0\u2019s tail ends at (0,5) not here. My tail ends at (7,3). So \u2018T\u2019 here is (8,7) \u2014 that\u2019s in my body? My body list: (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), \u2026 no (8,7) not in my body. Could be enemy body? Snake #0 body: (3,7) yes, but not (8,7). Wait, maybe \u2018T\u2019 means any body segment except head. But if it\u2019s not in listed coordinates, maybe diagram is wrong? Let\u2019s trust coordinates: (8,7) is not in my body list, not in enemy body list. So empty. So DOWN safe.\n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7,8) \u2014 That\u2019s my neck segment (first body segment). Moving into own body \u2192 death. So LEFT invalid.\n\nSo invalid: LEFT.  \nValid: UP, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Danger from enemy snake head collisions:\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (2,8). Possible moves for enemy from (2,8):  \n- UP \u2192 (2,9) \u2014 but (2,9) is in its own body (first body segment) \u2192 probably won\u2019t choose.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,7) \u2014 in its own body (2,7) is in its body list? Yes, (2,7) is in Snake #0 body. So invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,8) \u2014 empty? Board row 8 col 1 is \u2018.\u2019 \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,8) \u2014 in its own body (3,8) is in its body list? Yes, (3,8) is there. So invalid.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move from (2,8) is LEFT to (1,8).  \n\nThat means enemy will be at (1,8) next turn. No chance of head-on collision with me this turn because my possible moves (8,8) \u2192 UP (8,9), RIGHT (9,8), DOWN (8,7) are all far from (1,8). So no head-on risk.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Apples proximity:\n\nApples: (6,7), (9,5), (0,1), (3,0), (1,0).  \nFrom (8,8):  \n- (6,7) is 2 moves away (LEFT twice? Actually (8,8) \u2192 (7,8) invalid, so need DOWN then LEFT? Let\u2019s path: (8,8) \u2192 (8,7) \u2192 (7,7) \u2192 (6,7) is 3 moves).  \n- (9,5) is 3 moves away.  \n- Others far.\n\nClosest apple is (6,7) but not directly reachable in 1 move. No apple in immediate adjacent cells except none listed.\n\nSo no apple eating this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility after each move:\n\nFrom (8,8):  \n- **UP** to (8,9): Next turn from (8,9) possible moves: DOWN (back to (8,8) empty?), LEFT (7,9) empty, RIGHT (9,9) empty, UP invalid (off board). So 3 options. But top row reduces future upward moves.  \n- **RIGHT** to (9,8): Next turn from (9,8) possible moves: LEFT (8,8) will be empty then, DOWN (9,7) empty, UP (9,9) empty, RIGHT invalid (off board). So 3 options. Edge column.  \n- **DOWN** to (8,7): Next turn from (8,7) possible moves: UP (back to head\u2019s old position (8,8) empty), LEFT (7,7) is in my body next turn? Let\u2019s see: If I move DOWN, my body shifts: new head (8,7), body becomes [(8,8), (7,8), (7,7), \u2026]. So (7,7) is in my body next turn \u2192 invalid. RIGHT (9,7) empty, DOWN (8,6) empty. So 3 options but one blocked by own body.\n\nAll three safe moves give 3 options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Strategic plan:\n\nI want to approach apple (6,7) but must go around because direct left from (8,8) is body. So:  \nOption 1: DOWN to (8,7), then LEFT to (7,7) (body? next turn yes), so maybe not good. Actually if I go DOWN now, next turn from (8,7) left to (7,7) is my own body \u2192 so can\u2019t go left next turn if I go down now. That\u2019s bad.  \nOption 2: UP to (8,9), then next turn can go LEFT to (7,9) then DOWN etc toward apple.  \nOption 3: RIGHT to (9,8), then next turn LEFT to (8,8) (empty), then DOWN to (8,7) etc toward apple.\n\nBut apple (6,7) is close to enemy snake\u2019s area? Enemy at (2,8) moving to (1,8), still far from (6,7).  \n\nAlso apple (9,5) is closer if I go RIGHT then DOWN etc.\n\nGiven enemy\u2019s only move is LEFT to (1,8), I can safely move toward (9,5) apple.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note to future self:**  \nEnemy snake #0 only had one safe move last turn (LEFT to (1,8)), so it may be trapped soon. Keep heading toward apples (9,5) then maybe (6,7), avoid boxing self in. Maintain distance from enemy head path.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nGoing RIGHT to (9,8) keeps options open, moves toward apple (9,5), avoids any collision risk this turn, and doesn\u2019t reduce mobility more than other moves.\n\nRIGHT",

Possible moves from (9,7):\n- **UP** \u2192 (9,8) \u2013 That's my own neck (first body segment). Unsafe (death).\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (9,6) \u2013 Within board, empty? Board row 6 col 9 is '.' (row 6: `. T . . . T T T . .` \u2192 col 9 '.'). Not in my body, not in enemy body. Safe.\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (8,7) \u2013 Within board, empty? Board row 7 col 8 is 'T' (my body? Let's check: my body includes (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), etc. (8,7) is not in my body. Enemy body? No. Board shows row 7 col 8 as 'T' \u2014 wait, that might be me? Actually row 7 in board: `. T T T . . A T . 1` \u2192 col 8 is '.' (since '1' is col 9, col 8 is '.'). So (8,7) is empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 off board (x=10). Unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy snake #0 possible moves from (0,8):\nFrom (0,8):\n- UP \u2192 (0,9) \u2013 empty? Board row 9 col 0 is '.' Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,7) \u2013 empty? Board row 7 col 0 is '.' Safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 off board (x=-1). Unsafe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,8) \u2013 in enemy's own body (first segment). Unsafe.\n\nSo enemy's safe moves: UP to (0,9) or DOWN to (0,7).\n\nNo possible head-on collision for me this turn: my moves (9,6) or (8,7) are far from (0,9) or (0,7).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple proximity:\n- (9,5) is 1 step DOWN then 0 steps horizontally from (9,6), so if I go DOWN now to (9,6), next turn I can go DOWN to (9,5) and eat it.\n- (6,7) is closer to (8,7) than to (9,6) in Manhattan distance.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8,7), I'm closer to (6,7) (2 steps away: LEFT twice to (6,7)), but I'd be moving away from (9,5).\n\nGiven I have 10 apples vs enemy's 9, securing (9,5) quickly is good.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility:\nFrom (9,6) next turn:  \nPossible moves: UP (back to 9,7 \u2014 empty then), DOWN (9,5) apple, LEFT (8,6) empty? Check my body: if I move DOWN now, body becomes [(9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), ...]. So (8,6) not in my body next turn, safe. RIGHT off board. So 3 safe moves next turn, one leads to apple.\n\nFrom (8,7) next turn:  \nPossible moves: UP (8,8) \u2014 my own body next turn (will be second segment if I move LEFT now). Unsafe. DOWN (8,6) safe, LEFT (7,7) safe, RIGHT (9,7) safe. So 3 safe moves, but one less option (UP unsafe).\n\nBoth have similar mobility next turn, but (9,6) gives immediate path to apple next turn.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Long-term plan:\nEnemy is far left, no immediate threat. Securing (9,5) next turn gives me +1 apple lead. After that, consider heading toward (6,7) or other apples.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** DOWN\n\nDOWN",

Check immediate dangers for each move  \n\n**UP to (8, 4):**  \n- On board: yes.  \n- My body: My body list is [(8,4), (8,5), ...]. (8,4) is the first body segment right behind my head \u2014 moving into my own neck \u2192 **SUICIDE**. Eliminate UP.  \n\n**DOWN to (8, 2):**  \n- On board: yes.  \n- My body: Not in my body list.  \n- Enemy body: Snake #0 body is at [(0,4), (0,5), ..., (3,9)] \u2014 nowhere near (8,2). Safe from enemy body.  \n- Enemy head at (0,3) \u2014 far away, no collision possible this turn.  \n\n**LEFT to (7, 3):**  \n- On board: yes.  \n- My body: Not in my body list.  \n- Enemy body: Not in enemy body. Safe.  \n\n**RIGHT to (9, 3):**  \n- On board: yes.  \n- My body: Not in my body list.  \n- Enemy body: Not in enemy body. Safe.  \n\nSo **UP** is eliminated. DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe immediately.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Consider enemy head movement and possible collisions  \n\nEnemy head at (0, 3). Possible moves for enemy: UP to (0,4) \u2014 that\u2019s its own body, so maybe not, but maybe enemy chooses differently. Actually, (0,4) is part of snake #0\u2019s body (first segment after head), so moving UP would kill enemy \u2014 but we can\u2019t assume enemy won\u2019t choose suicide. Still, enemy is far away, so head-on collision impossible this turn regardless.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Future move availability  \n\n**DOWN to (8, 2):**  \nFrom (8,2): possible moves next turn: UP back to (8,3) (safe if my tail moves?), LEFT to (7,2), RIGHT to (9,2), DOWN to (8,1).  \n- UP to (8,3): currently my head\u2019s current position will be vacated, but my neck (8,4) will move to (8,3) if I go DOWN now? Wait \u2014 my body movement: head moves to (8,2), then each segment follows the previous segment\u2019s old position. So current (8,3) becomes segment 2\u2019s new position (old head position). So (8,3) next turn will have my body segment (old neck). So UP from (8,2) to (8,3) would hit myself next turn \u2192 eliminates UP next turn.  \nFrom (8,2), LEFT to (7,2) and RIGHT to (9,2) seem open; DOWN to (8,1) open. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**LEFT to (7, 3):**  \nFrom (7,3): possible moves next turn: UP to (7,4), DOWN to (7,2), LEFT to (6,3), RIGHT to (8,3).  \n- UP to (7,4): currently empty? Board shows T at (7,4)? Let\u2019s check board: row 4 col 7 is T (snake body). Yes, my body: (7,7), (7,6), (6,6) \u2014 no, (7,4) not in my body currently, but after movement, (7,4) will be occupied? Let\u2019s trace: My body: head (8,3) \u2192 (8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6). If I move LEFT to (7,3), then (8,3) becomes (8,4)\u2019s new position, etc. So (7,4) stays empty next turn? Actually (7,4) currently empty? Board at row 4 col 7: row 4 is y=4, col 7 is x=7, board shows \"T\" at (7,4)? Let\u2019s check carefully:  \nBoard:  \nRow 9: . A T T . . . . . .  \nRow 8: T T T . . . . T T T  \nRow 7: T . . . . . A T . T  \nRow 6: T . . . . . T T . T  \nRow 5: T . . . . . . . T T  \nRow 4: T . . . . . . . T .  \nRow 3: 0 . . . . . . . 1 .  \nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .  \nRow 1: A . . . . . . . . .  \nRow 0: . A . A . . . . . .  \n\nRow 4 (y=4): \"T . . . . . . . T .\" \u2192 at x=0: T, x=1: ., x=2: ., x=3: ., x=4: ., x=5: ., x=6: ., x=7: ., x=8: T, x=9: .  \nSo (7,4) is empty now. So UP from (7,3) to (7,4) is safe next turn.  \nDOWN to (7,2) empty. LEFT to (6,3) empty. RIGHT to (8,3) will be my body (old neck) next turn \u2192 unsafe. So from (7,3) next turn: 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n\n**RIGHT to (9, 3):**  \nFrom (9,3): next turn moves: UP to (9,4), DOWN to (9,2), LEFT to (8,3), RIGHT to (10,3) invalid.  \n- UP to (9,4): currently empty? Row 4 col 9 is empty (from board row 4: ends with \".\" at x=9). So safe.  \n- DOWN to (9,2): empty.  \n- LEFT to (8,3): will be my body next turn \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo from (9,3) next turn: only 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN).  \n\nSo DOWN and LEFT give 3 safe moves next turn, RIGHT gives 2 safe moves \u2192 prefer DOWN or LEFT over RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Apples proximity  \n\nApples: (3,0), (1,0), (0,1), (6,7), (1,9).  \nFrom (8,3):  \n- DOWN to (8,2): closer to bottom apples? (8,2) to (3,0): Manhattan distance 5+2=7.  \n- LEFT to (7,3): to (3,0): 4+3=7.  \nActually similar distances to bottom apples.  \nFrom (8,2), easier to go down to (8,1) then left toward (3,0) or (1,0).  \nFrom (7,3), easier to go down-left toward apples too.  \n\nBut (6,7) apple is far and near my body \u2014 risky to go up there now.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Avoid enemy  \n\nEnemy at (0,3), far left. I\u2019m on right side. Going DOWN or LEFT keeps me away from enemy. LEFT puts me at (7,3), still far.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Long-term plan  \n\nWe have a lead (11 vs 9 apples). Avoid risk. My body occupies top-right area; going DOWN opens bottom area. Going LEFT also opens central area.  \n\nDOWN seems slightly better because:  \n- From (8,2), next turn I can go LEFT to (7,2) and then down to (7,1) toward apples (1,0) or (3,0).  \n- Avoids moving toward my long body above.  \n\nLEFT to (7,3) also fine, but then my next move options might push me toward center where enemy could approach later.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:** DOWN gives good future options and moves toward apples while staying safe.  \n\nDOWN",

No immediate collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Future move availability:**  \n\nFrom (8,1) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (8,2) \u2192 currently my head\u2019s old position, but after movement, (8,2) will be occupied by my neck (currently at (8,3) moves to (8,2)) \u2192 unsafe next turn.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,0) \u2192 empty \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,1) \u2192 empty \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,1) \u2192 empty \u2192 safe.  \nSo from (8,1): 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nFrom (7,2) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (7,3) \u2192 currently empty, but after movement, my body segment from (8,3) moves to (8,2), so (7,3) stays empty \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,1) \u2192 empty \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,2) \u2192 empty \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,2) \u2192 will be my body (neck) \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo from (7,2): 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nFrom (9,2) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (9,3) \u2192 empty now, after movement, my body? Let\u2019s check: (9,3) currently empty, but (9,3) not in my body now, and after move, (8,3) moves to (8,2), (8,4) moves to (8,3), etc. So (9,3) stays empty \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,1) \u2192 empty \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,2) \u2192 will be my body (neck) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo from (9,2): only 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\nSo RIGHT is worse for future options.  \n\n---\n\n**Apples:** (3,0), (1,0), (0,1), (6,7), (1,9).  \n\nFrom (8,2):  \n- DOWN to (8,1): closer to bottom apples (Manhattan distance to (3,0) = |8-3|+|1-0| = 5+1=6).  \n- LEFT to (7,2): distance to (3,0) = 4+2=6.  \n- RIGHT to (9,2): distance to (3,0) = 6+2=8.  \n\nSo DOWN and LEFT equally close to bottom apples, RIGHT farther.  \n\n---\n\n**Risk avoidance:**  \nMy long body is above me (around y=3 to y=8). Going DOWN moves away from my body cluster, giving more space.  \nEnemy is at (0,2), moving toward me unlikely soon.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nBoth DOWN and LEFT are good. I\u2019ll choose DOWN because it moves toward apples (1,0) and (3,0) and keeps future options open.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (8,1), consider moving LEFT toward apples while avoiding trapping myself in corners. Keep away from enemy\u2019s possible path up the left side.  \n\nDOWN",

No, enemy is at (1, 1), can\u2019t reach (6, 1) in one move.  \n\nCould enemy go to (7, 2) if I go UP? No, enemy at (1, 1) \u2192 (7, 2) is too far.  \n\nCould enemy go to (7, 0) if I go DOWN? No.  \n\nSo no head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n**3. Apple targeting**  \nApples: (3, 0), (1, 0), (6, 7), (1, 9), (7, 9)  \nClosest to me: (3, 0) is 4 left, 1 down from (7, 1) \u2014 Manhattan distance 5. (1, 0) is farther. (6, 7) is 1 left, 6 up \u2014 Manhattan 7. (7, 9) is 0 left, 8 up \u2014 far.  \n\nActually (6, 7) is not closest by Manhattan? Let\u2019s compute:  \nFrom (7, 1):  \n- (3, 0): |7-3| + |1-0| = 4 + 1 = 5  \n- (1, 0): 6 + 1 = 7  \n- (6, 7): 1 + 6 = 7  \n- (1, 9): 6 + 8 = 14  \n- (7, 9): 0 + 8 = 8  \n\nSo closest is (3, 0), then (6, 7) and (1, 0) tie at 7.  \n\n**4. Safe moves evaluation**  \nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n- UP to (7, 2): moves toward (6, 7) and (7, 9) but not directly closer to (3, 0).  \n- DOWN to (7, 0): moves toward (3, 0) (down then left). Also gets me to bottom row, maybe limiting future moves? Bottom row y=0: from (7, 0), possible moves next turn: UP, LEFT, RIGHT? RIGHT to (8, 0) empty? Yes, (8, 0) empty. LEFT to (6, 0) empty? Yes. So not trapped.  \n- LEFT to (6, 1): moves toward (3, 0) and (6, 7).  \n\nWhich is best for future options?  \n\nLet\u2019s check next-turn safe moves from each:  \n\nFrom (7, 2): neighbors: (7, 3), (6, 2), (8, 2), (7, 1).  \n- (7, 3): empty? Board shows col 7 row 3: \u2018T\u2019 \u2014 yes, my body at (7, 8) is far, but (7, 3) not in my current body. Wait, my body after moving: head to (7, 2), body segments: old head (7, 1) becomes new neck, then (8, 1), (8, 2), etc. So (7, 3) not in new body. Safe.  \n- (6, 2): empty.  \n- (8, 2): my body (old (8, 1) moved to (8, 1)? Actually after move UP: body: [(7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2), \u2026] so (8, 2) is occupied. So UP from (7, 2) not possible next turn if I go UP this turn? Wait, check: if I move UP now to (7, 2), next turn my body: head (7, 2), neck (7, 1), then (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), \u2026 So (8, 2) is occupied. So from (7, 2), moving RIGHT to (8, 2) would be suicide. So future moves from (7, 2): UP to (7, 3) safe, DOWN to (7, 1) safe (but that\u2019s neck), LEFT to (6, 2) safe, RIGHT to (8, 2) unsafe. So 3 safe moves next turn from (7, 2).  \n\nFrom (7, 0): neighbors: (7, 1), (6, 0), (8, 0).  \n- (7, 1): neck, unsafe.  \n- (6, 0): empty.  \n- (8, 0): empty.  \nSo only 2 safe moves next turn from (7, 0).  \n\nFrom (6, 1): neighbors: (6, 2), (5, 1), (7, 1), (6, 0).  \n- (6, 2): empty.  \n- (5, 1): empty.  \n- (7, 1): neck, unsafe.  \n- (6, 0): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn from (6, 1).  \n\nSo UP and LEFT give 3 safe moves next turn, DOWN gives 2.  \n\n**5. Apple proximity**  \nLEFT moves me toward (3, 0) and (6, 7).  \nUP moves me toward (6, 7) and (7, 9).  \nDOWN moves me toward (3, 0) but reduces future options.  \n\nEnemy is likely going DOWN to (1, 0) to eat apple there, so (1, 0) will be gone soon.  \n\nI should go for (3, 0) or (6, 7). (6, 7) is farther but may be safer path (less near enemy).  \n\nBut my body occupies right side of board (col 8, 9), so going UP along col 7 might get me trapped later.  \n\nLEFT seems better: opens central board, more space.  \n\n**6. Long-term plan**  \nI\u2019m longer (length 12) than enemy (length 11). I can try to eat apples while avoiding boxing myself in. Central area (cols 3\u20136) has fewer body segments. Target (3, 0) soon, but need to approach carefully because bottom row has apples but also edges.  \n\nNext turn after LEFT to (6, 1), I can go DOWN to (6, 0) toward (3, 0) or LEFT again to (5, 1). Keep options open.  \n\n**Final choice**: LEFT gives good future options and moves toward nearest apple.  \n\nLEFT",

All moves are immediately fatal.\n\nNeed to review the game rules.\n\nIf at any point all opponents are dead and you are alive, you immediately win.\nIf multiple snakes are still alive at the final turn, the snake with the most apples wins. If apples are tied at the end of the game, the game is a draw.\nThe game lasts at most 150 turns.\nThe game ends immediately when any snake reaches 50 apples. If multiple snakes reach 50 or more on the same turn, the snake with the higher apple count wins that round; if tied, it is a draw.\nIf all snakes die on the same turn for any reason, the game ends immediately and the snake with more apples at that moment wins; if apples are tied, the game is a draw.\nIf another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\nIf two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die (head-on collision).\nIf you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point (1 apple).\nIf you move outside the board (beyond the listed coordinate ranges), you die.\nIf your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\n\nMy head is at (0,0) and body at (1,0).\n\nI made a wrong turn! I HAVE to go RIGHT.\nLast turn, I was at (1,0), chose LEFT and ended up at (0,0).\nThe available safe moves are (1,0) or somewhere else.\n\nThere is an error in the game state! If the head (0,0) and body (1,0), and I went LEFT LAST turn, the body should be oriented towards right.\n\nThe correct body should then be [(1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (1,1), ... etc] to form a right angle.\nBased on what I know, it doesn't matter what I pick, I think, it looks like I'm dead in any case.\nHowever, If everything is working correctly, I should be able to go right or somewhere!\n\nI think I will pick Right this time and hope I am not dead. There is no penalty anyway since all moves will lead to doom supposedly.\n\nRIGHT",
