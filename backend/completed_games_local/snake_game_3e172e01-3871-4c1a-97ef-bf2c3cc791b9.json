I am a single-segment snake.\nThe board is 10x10.\nApples are at: (6, 9), (1, 1), (4, 2), (1, 4), (6, 2).\nEnemy snake (ID 1) is at (5, 3).\n\nMy goal is to eat apples safely. Since I am at (9, 5) on the right edge, moving RIGHT is instantly fatal (off the board).\n\nSafe moves from (9, 5): UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n1. **UP to (9, 6):** Safe. Moves generally towards the (6, 9) apple, but slowly.\n2. **DOWN to (9, 4):** Safe. Moves toward the center/bottom, slightly away from closest apples initially.\n3. **LEFT to (8, 5):** Safe. Gets off the wall and opens up more movement options. Moves slightly towards the center.\n\nLet's evaluate apple proximity.\nClosest apples from (9, 5) in Manhattan distance:\nA1 (6, 9): distance |9-6| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7\nA2 (1, 1): distance |9-1| + |5-1| = 8 + 4 = 12\nA3 (4, 2): distance |9-4| + |5-2| = 5 + 3 = 8\nA4 (1, 4): distance |9-1| + |5-4| = 8 + 1 = 9\nA5 (6, 2): distance |9-6| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 = 6 (This is the closest)\n\nThe closest apple A5 is at (6, 2). To reach (6, 2) from (9, 5), I need to move 3 units LEFT and 3 units DOWN.\n\n*   If I move LEFT to (8, 5): Distance to (6, 2) becomes |8-6| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5.\n*   If I move DOWN to (9, 4): Distance to (6, 2) becomes |9-6| + |4-2| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n*   If I move UP to (9, 6): Distance to (6, 2) becomes |9-6| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7. (Bad choice for this apple)\n\nMoving LEFT or DOWN seems equally good based solely on distance to (6, 2).\n\nLet's consider the enemy snake (ID 1) at (5, 3). This snake is relatively close to (6, 2) and (4, 2).\nDistance from Snake 1 (5, 3) to (6, 2): |5-6| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2.\nSnake 1 is much closer to (6, 2) than I am (6 units away). Snake 1 is likely to go for (6, 2) or (4, 2) (distance 1 unit).\n\nDistance from Snake 1 (5, 3) to (4, 2): |5-4| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2.\nSnake 1 is also 2 units away from (4, 2).\n\nGiven that Snake 1 is very close to (6, 2) and (4, 2), trying to race for those is risky if I spend turns moving towards them only to have Snake 1 grab them.\n\nLet's check other apples:\nA4 (1, 4): distance 9 from me, 5 from Snake 1.\nA1 (6, 9): distance 7 from me, 7 from Snake 1. (Tied distance to A1)\nA3 (4, 2): distance 8 from me, 2 from Snake 1.\nA2 (1, 1): distance 12 from me, 6 from Snake 1.\n\nThe apple (6, 9) is potentially reachable before the enemy if we both go for it.\nMy current move LEFT (8, 5): Distance to (6, 9) = |8-6| + |5-9| = 2 + 4 = 6. (Better)\nMy current move UP (9, 6): Distance to (6, 9) = |9-6| + |6-9| = 3 + 3 = 6. (Better)\nMy current move DOWN (9, 4): Distance to (6, 9) = |9-6| + |4-9| = 3 + 5 = 8. (Worse)\n\nBoth LEFT and UP bring me closer to (6, 9).\n\nIf I move UP to (9, 6), I stay on the right wall but position myself higher.\nIf I move LEFT to (8, 5), I move into the open, which is generally good for keeping options open.\n\nConsidering the immediate closeness of Snake 1 to the bottom apples, moving UP or LEFT to aim for (6, 9) seems wiser.\n\nLet's compare UP and LEFT for the (6, 9) apple. Both yield a distance of 6.\n(9, 6) -> needs 3 LEFT, 3 UP.\n(8, 5) -> needs 2 LEFT, 4 UP.\n\nIf I choose UP (9, 6), I stay restricted by the wall.\nIf I choose LEFT (8, 5), I get off the wall and start moving towards the center, which gives me flexibility if (6, 9) is taken.\n\nAlso, Snake 1's position (5, 3) is relatively central.\nIf Snake 1 goes UP (5, 4), it moves closer to (6, 9). Distance 7 -> 6.\nIf Snake 1 goes RIGHT (6, 3), it moves towards (6, 2) and is on path for (6, 9). Distance to (6, 9) = |6-6| + |3-9| = 0 + 6 = 6.\nIf Snake 1 goes LEFT (4, 3), it moves towards (4, 2). Distance 7 -> 6.\nIf Snake 1 goes DOWN (5, 2), it moves towards (4, 2) and (6, 2).\n\nGiven the high proximity of Snake 1 to (6, 2) and (4, 2), I will not pursue those apples immediately. (6, 9) seems like a better target since our distance is tied.\n\nChoosing LEFT (8, 5) is strategically better than UP (9, 6) because it leaves more adjacent cells available for the next turn ((7, 5), (8, 6), (8, 4)) compared to (9, 6) where moving RIGHT is fatal ((8, 6), (9, 7), (9, 5)).\n\nLet's stick with LEFT to start moving towards the board interior while aiming for the top-right apple (6, 9).\n\nPlan: Move LEFT. Then continue moving generally UP/LEFT towards (6, 9).\n\n(9, 5) -> LEFT -> (8, 5). Safe.\n\nShort-term plan: Aim for the apple at (6, 9). Moving LEFT opens up the field.\n\nLEFT",

Length: 1.\nApples: (6, 9), (1, 1), (4, 2), (1, 4), (6, 2).\nMy last move was LEFT, moving from (9, 5) to (8, 5).\n\n1. Identify Illegal Moves from (8, 5):\n*   Moving into self: N/A (length 1).\n*   Moving off board:\n    *   RIGHT to (9, 5): Safe.\n    *   LEFT to (7, 5): Safe.\n    *   UP to (8, 6): Safe.\n    *   DOWN to (8, 4): Safe.\n*   Moving into enemy body: Snake 1 is length 1. N/A.\n*   All four directions are safe from immediate self/wall/body collision.\n\n2. Evaluate Safe Moves and Apple Proximity (Manhattan Distance to Apples from (8, 5)):\nA1 (6, 9): |8-6| + |5-9| = 2 + 4 = 6.\nA2 (1, 1): |8-1| + |5-1| = 7 + 4 = 11.\nA3 (4, 2): |8-4| + |5-2| = 4 + 3 = 7.\nA4 (1, 4): |8-1| + |5-4| = 7 + 1 = 8.\nA5 (6, 2): |8-6| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5. (Closest)\n\nSnake 1 is at (6, 3).\nS1 distance to A5 (6, 2): |6-6| + |3-2| = 1.\nS1 distance to A3 (4, 2): |6-4| + |3-2| = 3.\nS1 distance to A1 (6, 9): |6-6| + |3-9| = 6.\n\nSnake 1 is extremely close to A5 (6, 2). It will almost certainly grab A5 this turn by moving DOWN if it wants the shortest path apple.\n\nWe should target the next closest safe apple.\nA1 (6, 9) is 6 units away. Snake 1 is also 6 units away. This is still a close race.\nA3 (4, 2) is 7 units away. Snake 1 is 3 units away. Snake 1 is likely targeting A5 or A3.\n\nSince A5 (6, 2) is practically guaranteed to be eaten by Snake 1 (or contested by a head-on if I move directly towards it), I will focus on A1 (6, 9).\n\n3. Analyze Moves toward A1 (6, 9) - Target (6, 9):\n\n*   **Move UP to (8, 6):** New distance to (6, 9) = |8-6| + |6-9| = 2 + 3 = 5. (Shortest path/best directional move).\n*   **Move LEFT to (7, 5):** New distance to (6, 9) = |7-6| + |5-9| = 1 + 4 = 5. (Shortest path/best directional move).\n*   **Move RIGHT to (9, 5):** New distance to (6, 9) = |9-6| + |5-9| = 3 + 4 = 7. (Worse).\n*   **Move DOWN to (8, 4):** New distance to (6, 9) = |8-6| + |4-9| = 2 + 5 = 7. (Worse).\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are optimal in terms of distance reduction (d=5).\n\n4. Collision & Trapping Analysis:\nWe need to predict Snake 1's movement from (6, 3).\nS1 is 1 unit from (6, 2). S1 will likely move DOWN to (6, 2).\nS1 is 3 units from (4, 2).\nS1 is 6 units from (6, 9).\n\nIf S1 moves:\n*   DOWN to (6, 2) [Eats A5]: No collision risk with my current optimal moves (UP, LEFT).\n*   UP to (6, 4): Distances to A1 (6, 9) = 5.\n*   RIGHT to (7, 3): Distances to A1 (6, 9) = 6.\n*   LEFT to (5, 3): Distances to A1 (6, 9) = 7.\n\nIf S1 aims for A1 (6, 9), it should move UP to (6, 4).\nMy move options:\nA) Move UP to (8, 6).\nB) Move LEFT to (7, 5).\n\nIf S1 moves UP (6, 4):\n*   If I move UP (8, 6): We maintain a clear path difference and both proceed toward (6, 9).\n*   If I move LEFT (7, 5): I move closer to the vertical line of S1 movement. (S1 at (6, 4), Me at (7, 5)).\n\nMoving UP (8, 6) keeps me directly vertical to my target (6, 9) and away from the center where S1 might maneuver. If S1 goes UP (6, 4), S1 will then need 5 moves to reach (6, 9). If I go UP (8, 6), I need 5 moves to reach (6, 9). We remain equidistant unless one of us starts meandering.\n\nIf I move LEFT (7, 5), I am now in a very good position to pursue A3 (4, 2) (distance 5) or A4 (1, 4) (distance 7) if A1 (6, 9) is taken. This seems more flexible.\n\nLet's re-evaluate A3 (4, 2) distance 7. Snake 1 is 3 units away.\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 5), A3 is 5 units away.\nIf I move UP to (8, 6), A3 is 7 units away.\n\nIf S1 takes A5 (6, 2) by moving DOWN, then S1 is at (6, 2) and is length 2, body at (6, 3).\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 5), S1 is 4 units away from A3 (4, 2). I am 5 units away from A3 (4, 2). Still slightly behind.\n\nHowever, moving LEFT (7, 5) improves my vertical positioning relative to (6, 9) and also keeps my options open for other lower apples if S1 ignores them after grabbing (6, 2).\n\nLet's stick to the race for (6, 9) since it's the only apple where we share the same initial distance (6 units, after S1 potentially moves off the board or grabs a closer apple).\n\nIf I move UP to (8, 6), my path is 2 LEFT, 3 UP.\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 5), my path is 1 LEFT, 4 UP.\n\nBoth require 5 moves total. Moving UP (8, 6) keeps me in the relatively empty top right quadrant which is safer pathing. Moving LEFT to (7, 5) puts me closer to the enemy's vertical track (x=6).\n\nI choose UP to prioritize reaching the upper apple A1 (6, 9) via the simplest and safest path, minimizing potential conflict with Snake 1 which is hovering around x=6.\n\nFinal check: (8, 5) -> UP -> (8, 6). Safe move. Dist to (6, 9) reduces from 6 to 5.\n\nUP",

No conflict.\n*   All four directions are safe.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves and Apple Proximity (Manhattan Distance to Apples from (8, 6)):**\nA1 (6, 9): |8-6| + |6-9| = 2 + 3 = 5. (Target from last turn)\nA2 (1, 1): |8-1| + |6-1| = 7 + 5 = 12.\nA3 (4, 2): |8-4| + |6-2| = 4 + 4 = 8.\nA4 (1, 4): |8-1| + |6-4| = 7 + 2 = 9.\nA5 (8, 9): |8-8| + |6-9| = 0 + 3 = 3.

Strategy Update: New Target A5 (8, 9)**\nThe apple A5 (8, 9) is only 3 units away, and Snake 1 is 9 units away. This is now the clear optimal target.\n\n**4. Analyze Moves toward A5 (8, 9) - Target (8, 9):**\nCurrent position: (8, 6).\n*   **Move UP to (8, 7):** New distance to (8, 9) = |8-8| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2.

(Worse)\n*   **Move DOWN to (8, 5):** New distance to (8, 9) = |8-8| + |5-9| = 0 + 4 = 4. (Worse)\n\nMoving UP to (8, 7) keeps us on the direct vertical path to (8, 9), reducing the distance by 1.\n\n**5. Collision and Conflict Analysis:**\nSnake 1 is at (6, 2). It will likely target the closest apple, A3 (4, 2), which is 2 units away.\nPredicted S1 movement: LEFT to (5, 2) OR UP to (6, 3) (moving into its own body is suicide, so not UP/DOWN) or RIGHT to (7, 2).\nWait, Snake 1's body is at (6, 3).\nFrom (6, 2), S1 cannot move UP to (6, 3) (suicide into body).\nS1 safe moves: LEFT (5, 2), DOWN (6, 1), RIGHT (7, 2).\n\n*   If S1 targets A3 (4, 2) (distance 2): S1 must move LEFT to (5, 2).\n*   If S1 moves LEFT: My move UP to (8, 7) is completely safe.\n\nThere is minimal risk of immediate collision pursuing (8, 9).\n\n**6. Long-Term Plan:**\nCapture A5 (8, 9) by moving UP two more times. This is a very safe quick guaranteed apple. After that, assess the race for A1 (6, 9) (distance 5) versus A3 (4, 2) (distance 8, but Snake 1 is only 2 moves away). If Snake 1 grabs A3, we pivot to A1 (6, 9) or A4 (1, 4).\n\nThe safest and most productive move is UP.\n\nUP",

Identify Legal Moves for Snake 0 (Head at (6, 8)):**\n\n*   Board boundaries: 0-9.\n*   Body segments: (6, 9), (7, 9).\n*   Enemy segments: (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1).\n\n*   **UP (6, 9):** Into my body segment. **DEAD.**\n*   **DOWN (6, 7):** Safe. Moves directly toward (6, 2).\n*   **LEFT (5, 8):** Safe. Moves toward (4, 4).\n*   **RIGHT (7, 8):** Safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves for Snake 0:**\n\n*   **DOWN (6, 7):** Distance to (6, 2) becomes 5. Maintains simple vertical approach. Excellent.\n*   **LEFT (5, 8):** Distance to (6, 2) becomes 1 + 6 = 7 (worse). Distance to (4, 4) becomes 1 + 4 = 5 (better). This move shifts priority toward the western apples.\n*   **RIGHT (7, 8):** Distance to (6, 2) becomes 1 + 6 = 7 (worse). Distance to (4, 4) becomes 3 + 4 = 7 (worse). Bad direction.\n\nWe started a clear path towards (6, 2) last turn. Sticking to **DOWN** is the most efficient current plan, as it keeps the path clear and the apple uncontested.\n\n**4. Analyze Enemy Snake #1 (Head at (1, 1), Body: [(2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)]):**\n\nSnake 1 is now longer (length 4) and in the southwest corner. It is positioned favorably for (1, 0) (d=1) or (1, 4) (d=3) or (0, 4) (d=4).\n\nLegal Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (1, 1)):\n*   UP (1, 2): Safe.\n*   DOWN (1, 0): Safe. (Eats apple (1, 0)). Highly likely.\n*   LEFT (0, 1): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (2, 1): Into body. **DEAD.**\n\nPrediction: Snake 1 will move **DOWN** to (1, 0) and eat that apple. This is the closest remaining apple for them, and it is a safe move.\n\n**5. Check for Collisions based on Prediction (My move: (6, 7), Enemy 1 predicted move: (1, 0)):**\n\nNo risk of collision. The snakes are still far apart.\n\n**6. Long-Term Strategy Note:**\nContinue moving DOWN towards (6, 2). This path poses no immediate threat and ensures we score the next apple in our area. After eating (6, 2), we will reassess between (4, 4) and the remaining western apples, assuming Snake 1 has collected (1, 0).\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nTurn 8: Move DOWN to (6, 7). This continues the established, safe path directly toward the uncontested closest apple at (6, 2). Enemy Snake 1 is expected to move DOWN to (1, 0) and collect that apple, maintaining separation between the snakes.\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

(0, 3) leads toward (1, 0) via (0, 2), (0, 1). (0, 5) is less directed towards immediate apples. I predict DOWN to (0, 3) or UP to (0, 5) to save space.\n\n**5.

Check for Collision Risk:**\nMy move (6, 2) -> (5, 2).\nSnake 1 is likely moving (1, 5) -> (2, 5).\nThere is no risk of collision.\n\n**6. Determine Final Move:**\nMove LEFT to progress towards apple (4, 4).\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nTurn 14: Move LEFT to (5, 2) to target the apple at (4, 4). Snake 1 is likely to eat (2, 5).\nTurn 15: From (5, 2), move LEFT to (4, 2) (d=2 to (4, 4)).\nTurn 16: From (4, 2), move UP to (4, 3) (d=1 to (4, 4)).\nTurn 17: Move UP to (4, 4) to eat the apple.\nAfter eating (4, 4), the closest remaining apples are scattered: (1, 0), (9, 5), (7, 9).

Collision Risk Analysis: Snake 0 (5, 2) $\\to$ (4, 2) vs Snake 1 (2, 5) movement.**\n\nSnake 1 is likely to move RIGHT to (3, 5) or DOWN to (2, 4).\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (3, 5): d to (4, 4) is 2. S0 moves to (4, 2): d to (4, 4) is 2.\nNext turn: S1 at (3, 5). S0 at (4, 2).\nS1 needs to move D, D, R/L to get to (4, 4). e.g., (3, 4) $\\to$ (4, 4). Wait, (3, 5) -> (3, 4) (d=1+0=1) -> (4, 4). It is a 2 move path.\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (2, 4): d to (4, 4) is 2.\nNext turn: S1 at (2, 4). S0 at (4, 2).\nS1 needs to move R, R, U/D to get to (4, 4). e.g., (3, 4) $\\to$ (4, 4). Again, a 2 move path.\n\nOur path (4, 2) $\\to$ (4, 3) $\\to$ (4, 4) is 2 moves if we take LEFT.\nIf we take UP: (5, 3) $\\to$ (4, 3) $\\to$ (4, 4). Also 2 moves.\n\nIf Snake 1 moves (2, 5) -> (3, 5) (RIGHT), it will arrive at (4, 4) in two more moves: (3, 4), then (4, 4).\nIf Snake 0 moves (5, 2) -> (4, 2) (LEFT), it will arrive at (4, 4) in two more moves: (4, 3), then (4, 4).\n\nIf both snakes execute optimally, they will collide head-on at (4, 4) in T+2 (Turn 17).\nS0 Path: (5, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 4)\nS1 Path: (2, 5) -> (3, 5) -> (4, 5) -> (4, 4) (This is 3 moves for S1).\nS1 Path: (2, 5) -> (3, 5) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 4) (This is 3 moves for S1). Wait, (3, 5) to (3, 4) is 1 move. (3, 4) to (4, 4) is 1 move. Total 3 moves.\n\nLet's re-verify S1's path length to (4, 4):\nStart (2, 5). Target (4, 4). d=3.\nS1 Move 1: (3, 5) [d=2] or (2, 4) [d=2].\nIf S1 moves (3, 5): S1 Move 2: (3, 4) [d=1]. S1 Move 3: (4, 4) [Eats].\nIf S1 moves (2, 4): S1 Move 2: (3, 4) [d=1] or (2, 3) [d=3]. S1 Move 2 must be (3, 4). S1 Move 3: (4, 4) [Eats].\n\nConclusion: S1 requires 3 turns to reach (4, 4).\n\nSnake 0 (My Snake):\nStart (5, 2). Target (4, 4). d=3.\nS0 Move 1: (4, 2) [d=2].\nS0 Move 2: (4, 3) [d=1].\nS0 Move 3: (4, 4) [Eats].\n\nWe both require 3 turns to reach (4, 4) if we take the shortest path. This means a head-on collision at (4, 4) on Turn 18 is highly probable if we both pursue this apple aggressively.\n\nWe need to choose a move that prepares us to win the tiebreaker, or switch to a less contested apple if the collision risk is certain.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (4, 2), we are in a tight spot.\n(4, 2) is open. Adjacent cells: (3, 2), (5, 2)[body], (4, 1), (4, 3). No immediate dead end.\n\nIf we move UP to (5, 3), we are also well-positioned. (6, 3) is body. Adjacent cells: (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 3)[body], (5, 2)[tail clears].\n\nMoving LEFT gets us onto the X-coordinate of the apple, which is generally good for alignment.\n\nLet's anticipate S1's optimal counter-play if it senses a race.\nS1 is currently at (2, 5). It has open space to the right (towards 9, 5) and down (towards 1, 0, but that's far).\nSince (4, 4) is the closest apple for both, S1 is very likely to choose (3, 5) or (2, 4).\n\nIf we both move optimally, we collide. However, Snake 1 might prioritize maneuvering space given its current long body (length 7). Snake 1 might move UP to (2, 6) or RIGHT to (3, 5). Moving DOWN to (2, 4) is also strong.\n\nIf S1 chooses to move RIGHT to (3, 5):\nTurn 16: S1 at (3, 5). S0 at (4, 2).\nTurn 17: S1 must move to (3, 4) (d=1, clears tail at 1, 2). S0 moves to (4, 3) (d=1).\nTurn 18: S1 moves to (4, 4). S0 moves to (4, 4). **Head-on collision.**\n\nIf we anticipate this collision, we must deviate. If we deviate, S1 gets the apple uncontested. Since we are behind 3 vs 6, we must fight for apples.\n\nAlternatively, we could target (8, 4), distance 5.\nIf we pursue (8, 4):\nMove 1: RIGHT to (6, 2) (FATAL) - no.\nMove 1: UP to (5, 3). d to (8, 4) = 3 + 1 = 4.\nMove 1: LEFT to (4, 2). d to (8, 4) = 4 + 2 = 6. BAD.\n\nIf we want (8, 4), we should move UP to (5, 3).\n(5, 2) $\\to$ (5, 3) (d=4)\n$\\to$ (6, 3) or (5, 4)\n(5, 3) $\\to$ (6, 3) (d=2+1=3). (6, 3) is currently my body. Tail is (6, 4). Wait, (6, 3) is my body segment 2. (6, 4) is tail. Since we didn't eat, (6, 4) clears, (6, 3) remains. So moving to (6, 3) is FATAL.\n(5, 3) $\\to$ (5, 4) (d=3+0=3). Safe.\n(5, 4) $\\to$ (6, 4) (d=2+0=2). (6, 4) is now clear. Safe.\n(6, 4) $\\to$ (7, 4) (d=1+0=1). Safe.\n(7, 4) $\\to$ (8, 4) (EATS). Total 4 moves for (8, 4).\n\nWe can reach (4, 4) in 3 moves. We can reach (8, 4) in 4 moves. We must go for (4, 4).\n\nSince S1 is the same distance, and we are not long enough to block or gain an advantage by maneuvering, we must commit to the shortest path and hope S1 calculates a lower risk move towards a different apple or attempts a more circuitous route.\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (2, 6) (d=4 to (4, 4)), or moves towards (1, 0) (d=6), we win the race.\n\nChoosing between LEFT (4, 2) and UP (5, 3).\nLEFT (4, 2) is a stronger strategic choice because it aligns perfectly on the (X=4) column leading to the apple (4, 4) without crossing any potential lines of sight from S1, whose moves are centered around X=2/X=3.\n\nS0: (5, 2) -> (4, 2).\nS1 likely (2, 5) -> (3, 5) or (2, 4). Both paths lead S1 away from (4, 2). No collision risk this turn.\n\nWe prioritize the shortest path to gain points.\n\nLong Term Rationale check for collision mitigation:\nIf we arrive at (4, 3) on T17, and S1 is at (3, 4) or (4, 5) on T17, S1 might realize the collision risk and try to block us or move away. Given S1's length, it might be looking for corners. If S1 veers towards (7, 9) or (9, 5), S1 will miss (4, 4).\n\nWe must commit to LEFT.\n\n**Revised Short-Term Strategy (3 Turns):**\nT15: Move **LEFT** to (4, 2). (d=2 to (4, 4)).\nT16: Move UP to (4, 3). (d=1 to (4, 4)).\nT17: Move UP to (4, 4). (EAT Apple). (Assuming S1 is not exactly at (4, 4) or (5, 4) or (3, 4) this turn). If S1 is on collision path, we must be ready to veer.\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (3, 5) on T15:\nT16: S1 moves (3, 4). S0 moves (4, 3). (Adjacent, high tension).\nT17: S1 moves to (4, 4). S0 moves to (4, 4). COLLIDE.\n\nIf this trajectory seems unavoidable, we must deviate on T16.\nIf S0 is at (4, 2) and S1 is at (3, 4) on T16, we move UP to (4, 3). S1 moves RIGHT/UP to (4, 4) or (3, 5) (wait, S1 at (3, 4). S1 moves UP to (3, 5) (d=2) or RIGHT to (4, 4) (EATS apple).\n\nWait, if S1 is at (3, 4) on T16, it can move RIGHT to (4, 4) on T17 and eat the apple.\nIf S0 is at (4, 3) on T16, it can move UP to (4, 4) on T17 and eat the apple.\nThis implies S1 can win if it hits the shortest path immediately.\n\nS1 Path: (2, 5) -> (3, 5) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 4) (Eats T18)\nS0 Path: (5, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 4) (Eats T18)\n\nThey both arrive at (4, 4) simultaneously on Turn 18. This is a guaranteed head-on collision.\n\nWe cannot afford to deviate and lose the apple. We are behind. We must take the shortest path and gamble, or try to take a path that might deter S1.\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT (3, 5) on T15.\nIf S0 moves UP (5, 3) on T15. (d=2)\nT16: S1 moves DOWN (3, 4) (d=1). S0 moves LEFT (4, 3) (d=1).\nT17: S1 moves RIGHT (4, 4). S0 moves UP (4, 4). COLLISION.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (4, 2), we are well positioned for an alternate apple (1, 0) d=4, or (8, 4) d=6, if S1 actually moves there.\n(4, 2) is a central position.\n\nGiven the distance parity and the need to score, I must take the shortest path and rely on S1 choosing a safer, less competitive route due to being ahead in score and having a longer body (which usually leads to slower, more careful movement).\n\n**Final Decision:** Move LEFT to (4, 2).\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nTurn 15: Move LEFT to (4, 2) to maintain the shortest path (3 turns total) to apple (4, 4). This move introduces a high risk of head-on collision with Snake 1 on Turn 18, assuming Snake 1 also pursues the shortest path. If S1 deviates due to collision avoidance or targets another apple (e.g., (1, 0) or (7, 9)), we secure (4, 4). If S1 continues on the path (2, 5) -> (3, 5) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 4), collision will occur. Alternative targets (e.g., (8, 4)) take longer (4 turns minimum). Given the score deficit, aggressive pursuit is necessary.\nT16: Move UP to (4, 3).\nT17: Evaluate S1's position at T17. If S1 is at (3, 4) or (5, 4), collision is imminent. If so, attempt to block S1's future movement around (4, 4) or pivot immediately to (8, 4). Otherwise, move UP to (4, 4) and eat.\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nLEFT",

We are still significantly behind (3 vs 6).\n\n**1. Calculate Apple Distances (Manhattan) for Snake 0 (Head at (4, 2)):**\n\n*   Target A1 (4, 4): d = |4-4| + |4-2| = 0 + 2 = 2.

Analyze Enemy Snake #1 (Head at (3, 5)) and the Race for (4, 4):**\n\n*   Snake 1 is at (3, 5).

Total 2 moves.\n    *   If S1 moves to (4, 5) [RIGHT]: d to (4, 4) is 1. (4, 5) $\\to$ (4, 4). Total 2 moves.\n\nIf both snakes move optimally:\nT17: S0 reaches (4, 4), S1 reaches (4, 4). **Guaranteed Head-on Collision.**\n\nThe previous rationale identified this collision risk for T18 (since I was using T15/T16 calculations). Now at T16, both snakes are 2 moves away, meaning collision occurs on T17.\n\nWe must change targets or try to block/outmaneuver Snake 1. Since Snake 1 is longer, risking a head-on collision benefits only the overall game state for the remaining competition, but guarantees our death. We must survive.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head at (4, 2)):**\n\n*   My body segments: (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3).\n\n*   **UP (4, 3):** Safe. Moves toward (4, 4). (Collision path).\n*   **DOWN (4, 1):** Safe. Moves away from (4, 4).\n*   **LEFT (3, 2):** Safe. Diagonal movement away from (4, 4).\n*   **RIGHT (5, 2):** Into body segment. **DEAD.**\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**4. Recalculating Strategy based on Collision Risk:**\n\nIf we move UP to (4, 3), we are committing to the collision path. We die next turn unless S1 chooses to move away (e.g., UP to (3, 6) or towards (9, 5)).\n\nDistance to (4, 4) if we turn:\n*   Move DOWN (4, 1): d to (4, 4) = 3. Now 3 moves away. (4, 1) $\\to$ (4, 2) $\\to$ (4, 3) $\\to$ (4, 4). We lose the race.\n*   Move LEFT (3, 2): d to (4, 4) = |4-3| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3. Now 3 moves away. We lose the race.\n\nIf we cannot win (4, 4) without dying, we must switch targets.\n\nNew targets reachable in 3-4 moves:\n*   (1, 0): d=5.\n*   (8, 4): d=6.\n\nLet's evaluate movements toward (1, 0) (d=5).\n\n*   Move DOWN (4, 1): d to (1, 0) = 3 + 1 = 4.\n*   Move LEFT (3, 2): d to (1, 0) = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (4, 1), we are 4 moves from (1, 0).\nIf S1 targets (1, 0): S1 (3, 5). d=5. S1 could get there in 5 moves. If S1 pursues (4, 4), we might secure (1, 0).\n\nLet's evaluate movements toward (8, 4) (d=6).\n\n*   Move DOWN (4, 1): d to (8, 4) = 4 + 3 = 7. Bad.\n*   Move LEFT (3, 2): d to (8, 4) = 5 + 2 = 7. Bad.\n\nIf we move UP (4, 3), distance to (8, 4) increases to d=5.\n\nThe most viable secondary target is (1, 0). To reach it in the fewest moves (d=4), we should move DOWN or LEFT.\n\n**Checking S1's motivation:**\nS1 is ahead and has a large body. S1 highly values survival. The direct optimal path to (4, 4) leads to certain mutual death. S1 *might* deviate to avoid death.\n\nIf S1 moves:\n1. S1 moves RIGHT to (4, 5): (4, 5) $\\to$ (4, 4). Collision imminent.\n2. S1 moves DOWN to (3, 4): (3, 4) $\\to$ (4, 4). Collision imminent.\n3. S1 moves UP to (3, 6): d to (4, 4) = 1 + 2 = 3. S1 loses the race, we win.\n4. S1 moves LEFT to (2, 5): Into body (2, 5). FATAL.\n\nIf we move UP to (4, 3), we force S1 to choose between dying with us, or choosing a suboptimal path (3, 6) and letting us win the apple.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (4, 1) or LEFT to (3, 2), we concede (4, 4) to Snake 1.\nIf S1 moves RIGHT (4, 5) or DOWN (3, 4), S1 eats it on T17.\n\nGiven the score disadvantage, we must force the issue. If S1 is rational and values its lead, it should choose path (3, 6) or try to pivot towards (7, 9) or (9, 5).\n\nPath to (7, 9) from S1 (3, 5): d = 4 + 4 = 8.\nPath to (9, 5) from S1 (3, 5): d = 6 + 0 = 6.\n\nIf S1 pivots towards (9, 5): S1 RIGHT (4, 5) d=5, RIGHT (5, 5) d=4... 6 moves total.\nIf S1 pivots towards (3, 6) UP: d to (4, 4) is 3.\n\nIf we move UP (4, 3), we are forcing S1 to deviate or die. S1's safest non-losing deviation toward an apple is UP to (3, 6). If S1 does this, we secure (4, 4).\n\nIf S1 is purely greedy and ignores the collision rule complexity, it will move (4, 5) or (3, 4) and we both die.\n\nWe must make the move that leads to eating the apple unless S1 takes a rational avoidance path.\n\n**Scenario: Move UP (4, 3)**\n*   If S1 moves (3, 6) [UP]: We eat (4, 4). WIN.\n*   If S1 moves (4, 5) [RIGHT] or (3, 4) [DOWN]: We die. DRAW/LOSS (based on tiebreaker, but unlikely to win in a shared death).\n\n**Scenario: Move DOWN (4, 1)**\n*   S1 moves (4, 5) or (3, 4). S1 eats (4, 4). S1 wins the race. We pivot to (1, 0).\n\nSince we are behind and need to gain position/apples, passively letting S1 extend its lead is bad. The only way to contest this apple is to move UP. We are betting that S1, being ahead, will prioritize survival and deviate, allowing us to eat.\n\nLet's explicitly review S1's legal moves from (3, 5):\n1. UP (3, 6): Safe.\n2. DOWN (3, 4): Safe. Moves toward (4, 4). Collision risk.\n3. RIGHT (4, 5): Safe. Moves toward (4, 4). Collision risk.\n4. LEFT (2, 5): Into body. FATAL.\n\nIf S1 moves (3, 4) or (4, 5), it is equivalent to a suicidal collision if we move (4, 3).\nIf S1 moves (3, 6), S1 lives, we eat (4, 4).\n\nIf we move DOWN (4, 1), we survive, but we lose the closest apple entirely.\n\nGiven that S1 is much longer (7 vs 4) and has double the score (6 vs 3), S1 has much more to lose by dying. I rely on S1's rationale being conservative.\n\n**Final Decision Confidence Check:** We must move UP. It's the only way to potentially gain the apple and force S1 to make a costly deviation. If S1 chooses suicide, we die, but we didn't give up the apple for free.\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nTurn 16: Move UP to (4, 3). This move maintains the shortest path (2 moves total) to apple (4, 4). This move creates a certain head-on collision on T17 if Snake 1 also pursues the shortest path (moving DOWN to (3, 4) or RIGHT to (4, 5)). Since Snake 1 is leading (6 apples, Length 7), we bet that S1 will prioritize survival and deviate (e.g., move UP to (3, 6)), allowing us to secure (4, 4). If S1 deviates, we move to (4, 4) on T17. If S1 commits to the collision, we die, but we forced the issue rather than yielding a vital apple.\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nUP",

S1 moves (4, 6).\nT18: I am at (5, 3). d to (8, 4) is 4. S1 is at (4, 6). d to (8, 4) = 4 + 2 = 6.\n\nWait, if S1 moves DOWN to (4, 4), S1 dies with me. S1 *must* move away from (4, 4) to survive.\nS1's safe moves from (4, 5):\n1. UP (4, 6): Safe.\n2. LEFT (3, 5): Into body (3, 5). FATAL.\n3. RIGHT (5, 5): Safe.\n4. DOWN (4, 4): Collision with me. FATAL.\n\nS1 must move UP or RIGHT.\n\nCase 1: S1 moves UP (4, 6).\n*   S1 (4, 6) is d=6 from (8, 4).\n*   If I move RIGHT (5, 3), I am d=4 from (8, 4). I am ahead.\n\nCase 2: S1 moves RIGHT (5, 5).\n*   S1 (5, 5) is d=4 from (8, 4).\n*   If I move RIGHT (5, 3), I am d=4 from (8, 4). This results in another neck-and-neck scenario, though not necessarily a collision immediately. (5, 5) and (5, 3) are 2 units apart on the Y axis.\n\nLet's prioritize the path to (8, 4) by moving RIGHT to (5, 3). This is the shortest path to any remaining apple and forces S1 to compete for it or move towards the distant (7, 9) or (9, 5).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 3):\nMy path to (8, 4) (4 moves): (5, 3) -> (6, 3) -> (7, 3) -> (8, 3) -> (8, 4).\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (5, 5):\nS1's path to (8, 4) (4 moves): (5, 5) -> (6, 5) -> (7, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (8, 4).\nWe are competing, but we are well separated right now (Y difference of 2).\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (4, 6):\nS1's path to (8, 4) (6 moves): (4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (8, 5) -> (8, 4). I definitely win this race.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (5, 3) secures the best position for the next apple, (8, 4), while definitely surviving the immediate turn.\n\n**Long-term strategy note:** I narrowly avoided a guaranteed death on T17 by predicting the collision trajectory and being prepared to pivot. Now, I pivot towards (8, 4) to close the score gap.\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nTurn 17: Both snakes were on a collision course for the apple at (4, 4). My head is at (4, 3) and Snake 1's head is at (4, 5). Moving UP (4, 4) or S1 moving DOWN (4, 4) means mutual death. I must survive. The safest and most opportunistic move is RIGHT to (5, 3). This move positions me 4 Manhattan distance units from (8, 4). Snake 1 must move UP or RIGHT to survive. If S1 moves UP (4, 6), I gain a strong lead on (8, 4). If S1 moves RIGHT (5, 5), we remain competitive for (8, 4), but the paths are staggered (Y=3 vs Y=5). Survival is met, and a new apple chase is initiated.\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

Safe, as length is 4 (no growth last turn).\n*   **LEFT (4, 3):** Moves into my body (the segment directly behind the head). **FATAL.**\n*   **RIGHT (6, 3):** Safe. Moves one step closer to (8, 4) (d=3).\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**4. Strategic Evaluation:**\n\n*A. Competing for (8, 4):*\nWe are currently separated by the cell (5, 4).

I am ahead.\n    *   If S1 moves LEFT (4, 5), S1 is d=4 from (8, 4). We remain competitive.\n    *   If S1 moves RIGHT (6, 5), S1 is d=3 from (8, 4). We remain competitive.\n\nMoving UP to (5, 4) is highly risky due to the unavoidable collision if S1 chooses DOWN. Since S1 is closer to the center of the board and slightly constrained by their body/tail, S1 might choose to move down to cut me off or simply for the shortest path to an apple (like (4, 4) or (8, 4)).\n\nMust avoid (5, 4) if S1 might go there.\n\n*B. Moving RIGHT to (6, 3):*\nThis continues the path towards (8, 4) and maintains separation from S1.\n*   My position: (6, 3). d to (8, 4) is 3.\n*   S1's safe moves from (5, 5):\n    *   If S1 moves RIGHT (6, 5): S1 is d=3 from (8, 4). We are neck and neck, but separated (Y=3 vs Y=5). Safe race.\n    *   If S1 moves UP (5, 6): S1 is d=5 from (8, 4). I win the race.\n    *   If S1 moves DOWN (5, 4): S1 is d=4 from (8, 4). I win the race.\n    *   If S1 moves LEFT (4, 5): S1 is d=4 from (8, 4). I win the race.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 3) seems optimal as it makes progress toward the target (8, 4) while minimizing collision risk. Even if S1 moves RIGHT to (6, 5), we are separated.\n\n*C. Moving DOWN to (5, 2):*\nThis is safe (moving onto the tail).\n*   My position: (5, 2). d to (8, 4) is |8-5| + |4-2| = 3 + 2 = 5. (Worse progress than RIGHT).\n*   d to (4, 4) is |4-5| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nThis is a defensive move that sacrifices apple advantage for safety, but (6, 3) is equally safe while being aggressive.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving RIGHT to (6, 3) is the best choice. It makes maximum safe progress towards the nearest target (8, 4) alongside S1, and critically, avoids the common collision square (5, 4).\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nTurn 18: After pivot to (5, 3), S1 also moved to (5, 5). Both snakes are distance 4 from (8, 4). Moving UP to (5, 4) creates an immediate head-on collision risk if S1 tries to move DOWN to cut me off or claim the space. To continue the attack on (8, 4) while maintaining separation, the safest move is RIGHT to (6, 3). This reduces my distance to (8, 4) to 3, matching S1's optimal distance if S1 moves RIGHT to (6, 5). This sets up a safe, horizontal race for the apple.\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

Evaluate Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head at (6, 3)):**\n\n*   My Body segments: (5, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2).\n*   Enemy Head: (6, 5).\n\n*   **UP (6, 4):** Safe. Moves one step closer to (8, 4) (d=2). This puts us on the Y=4 row, allowing a direct path right towards (8, 4).\n*   **DOWN (6, 2):** Safe. This moves away from all immediate apples (d to (8, 4) increases to 4).\n*   **LEFT (5, 3):** Moves into my body (the segment directly behind the head). **FATAL.**\n*   **RIGHT (7, 3):** Safe. Moves towards (8, 4) (d=2). Maintains Y=3 level, separated from S1.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**4. Analyze Enemy Snake #1 (Head at (6, 5)):**\n\nS1's Body: [(5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (0, 5)].\n\nS1's Safe Moves from (6, 5):\n\n*   **UP (6, 6):** Safe. d to (8, 4) becomes 4.\n*   **DOWN (6, 4):** Safe. This is my potential target square (UP). d to (8, 4) becomes 2. **Immediate Head-on Collision potential if I choose UP.**\n*   **LEFT (5, 5):** FATAL (into its own body).\n*   **RIGHT (7, 5):** Safe. d to (8, 4) becomes 3. d to (9, 5) becomes 2.\n\n**5. Strategic Decision:**\n\nWe are racing S1 for (8, 4).\n\n*   **Option A: Move UP to (6, 4).**\n    *   This is the optimal geometrical move towards (8, 4) (d=2).\n    *   However, S1 can move DOWN to (6, 4). Since S1 is closer to the center line Y=4/Y=5, S1 might prioritize moving DOWN to secure the path to (8, 4) or (4, 4).\n    *   If S1 moves DOWN, **Fatal Head-on Collision at (6, 4).** Risk is too high.\n\n*   **Option B: Move RIGHT to (7, 3).**\n    *   d to (8, 4) becomes 2. (Same distance reduction as UP).\n    *   S1's counter-moves:\n        *   If S1 moves RIGHT (7, 5): S1 is d=3 from (8, 4). I pull ahead (2 vs 3).\n        *   If S1 moves UP (6, 6): S1 is d=4 from (8, 4). I pull ahead.\n        *   If S1 moves DOWN (6, 4): S1 is d=2 from (8, 4). We are tied distance-wise, but separated (Y=3 vs Y=4). This is a safe split scenario.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7, 3) allows me to make optimal progress toward (8, 4) (distance 2), while completely mitigating the risk of a Head-on collision at (6, 4). This move maintains separation from S1, regardless of S1's move, and gives me better positioning to potentially hit the apple at (8, 4) first.\n\n*   **Option C: Move DOWN to (6, 2).** (d=4 to (8, 4)). This gives up the race. Not desirable given competitive scores.\n\nConclusion: RIGHT (7, 3) is the safest aggressive move.\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nTurn 19: Both snakes are at distance 3 from the optimal target (8, 4). My head is at (6, 3), S1's head is at (6, 5). Moving UP to (6, 4) would reduce my distance to 2, but creates an immediate, high-risk head-on collision if S1 moves DOWN to (6, 4). To advance safely towards (8, 4), the best move is RIGHT to (7, 3). This also reduces the distance to 2, and maintains horizontal separation (Y=3 vs S1's Y=5 or Y=4 if S1 moves down). This move improves my position in the race while minimizing collision risk. Next turn, I will likely move UP to (7, 4) or RIGHT to (8, 3) depending on S1's position.\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

I am d=1 from A5. We are separated by one cell horizontally. We are both one move away, but S1 has a direct UP move and I have a direct UP move. S1's move (7, 4) leads to (7, 5) and (8, 4). My move (8, 3) leads to (8, 4).\n        *   If S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 5): S1 is highly prioritizing A4 (9, 5) (d=1). S1 is now d=2 from A5 (8, 4). This puts me in a winning position for A5.\n        *   If S1 moves UP (7, 6): S1 is giving up the race.\n\n**Collision Avoidance and Target Lock:**\n\nThe risk of immediate collision at (7, 4) is too high because both snakes get the maximum benefit (d=1 to A5) from that move.\n\nHowever, if I move RIGHT to (8, 3):\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 5) (best move for S1 towards its own prioritized apple A4):\n*   Next turn: My head is (8, 3). Moves: UP to (8, 4) (Eat A5).\n*   Next turn: S1's head is (8, 5). S1 is d=2 from A5 now. S1 will move RIGHT to (9, 5) (Eat A4). S1 won't be able to interfere with A5. I eat A5.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 3) and S1 moves DOWN to (7, 4) (best move for A5):\n*   Next turn: My head is (8, 3). Safe moves: UP to (8, 4) (Eat A5).\n*   Next turn: S1's head is (7, 4). Safe moves: UP to (7, 5) (backtracking), RIGHT to (8, 4) (Eat A5), DOWN to (7, 3) (hit my old body segment), LEFT to (6, 4).\n    *   Wait, S1 moving DOWN to (7, 4) is safe. Our old body segment (7, 3) is now free.\n    *   If S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 4) and I move UP to (8, 4), this is a **Fatal Head-on Collision** one turn later.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the risk of moving to (8, 3) vs (7, 4) given S1's most probable moves.\n\nS1 is trying to get apples. A4 (9, 5) is distance 2 and A5 (8, 4) is distance 2.\n1. S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 5) to target A4 (d=1). (S1 prioritizes minimizing distance).\n2. S1 moves DOWN to (7, 4) to target A5 (d=1).\n\nIf S1 moves (8, 5), I secure A5 regardless of my move (7, 4) or (8, 3).\nIf S1 moves (7, 4), the collision risk exists regardless of my move today.\n\nIf I move UP to (7, 4): Immediate collision risk if S1 moves DOWN.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 3):\nNext turn:\nI will move UP to (8, 4).\nIf S1 chose (7, 4) this turn, S1 has two choices to maximize utility:\n    1. RIGHT to (8, 4). (Collision with me at (8, 4))\n    2. UP to (7, 5). (Gives up A5)\n\nSince S1 is prioritizing apples and is currently ahead, S1 is likely aggressive. Moving UP to (7, 4) on this turn is a direct path and invites a 50/50 collision.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (8, 3) keeps separation *this* turn. The collision risk shifts one turn later to (8, 4).\n\nLet's assume S1 calculates the collision risk at (7, 4) is too high and avoids it. S1 will likely move RIGHT to (8, 5) to secure A4 (9, 5), where it is guaranteed success unless I interfere (which I cannot easily do if I prioritize A5).\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT (8, 5):\nMe (7, 3) -> RIGHT (8, 3).\nNext turn: Me (8, 3) -> UP (8, 4) (Eat A5). S1 (8, 5) -> RIGHT (9, 5) (Eat A4). Safe, mutually beneficial turn for apple collection.\n\nIf I move UP (7, 4):\nIf S1 predicts I move UP, S1 might move RIGHT (8, 5) to stay safe and secure A4.\nIf S1 moves RIGHT: Me (7, 4) -> RIGHT (8, 4) (Eat A5). Safe.\n\nThe move UP to (7, 4) carries an immediate, turn-20 fatal risk if S1 plays optimally for A5.\nThe move RIGHT to (8, 3) carries a turn-21 fatal risk if S1 plays optimally for A5, BUT it is geometrically farther from S1's current path and S1 has an alternative apple (A4) that is marginally better positioned for S1 via the RIGHT move.\n\nI prioritize immediate safety. Moving RIGHT to (8, 3) is safe this turn regardless of S1's move, and still maintains my optimal distance of 1 to A5. I believe S1 will prioritize A4 (9, 5) by moving RIGHT to (8, 5) to avoid the (7, 4) collision potential with me, allowing me to take A5 uncontested starting from (8, 3).\n\nRIGHT.\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nTurn 20: By moving RIGHT to (8, 3), I maintain distance 1 to R5 (8, 4) while avoiding the high-risk head-on collision at (7, 4) with Snake 1. Snake 1 is likely to move RIGHT to (8, 5) to secure A4 (9, 5) which is also distance 2 away and a better geometrical progression for S1 away from me. If S1 moves RIGHT, I will move UP to (8, 4) to eat the apple next turn. If S1 moves DOWN towards (7, 4), I shift the potential collision to the next turn at (8, 4), but hope S1 prioritizes collision avoidance or A4.\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

Analyze Enemy Snake #1 (Head at (8, 5)):**\n\nS1 Body: [(7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5)].\n\nS1's Apple Distances:\n*   A4 (9, 5): d = |9-8| + |5-5| = 1.

Collision Risk Assessment:**\n\nMy move: UP to (8, 4).\nS1's threatening move: DOWN to (8, 4).\n\nIf I move UP and S1 moves DOWN, we have a **Head-on Collision** at (8, 4). Both snakes die, and the game ends with S1 winning 6 apples to 4 apples. This is disastrous.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision (Prioritizing Survival/Apple Collection):**\n\nI am at (8, 3) and A5 is at (8, 4).\nS1 is at (8, 5) and A5 is at (8, 4).\nThis is a perfect symmetric collision trap for A5.\n\nHowever, S1 also has A4 at (9, 5), which is distance 1.\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (9, 5), S1 eats A4.\nIf I move UP to (8, 4), I eat A5. This is the optimal, safe, mutual apple collection scenario.\n\nIn the previous turn's rationale, I gambled that S1 would prioritize A4 via the RIGHT-move to avoid a collision we set up at (7, 4). This gamble paid off, as S1 moved RIGHT to (8, 5) to secure a path to A4 (9, 5).\n\nS1 now has two 1-distance apples: A5 (8, 4) and A4 (9, 5).\n\n*   If S1 moves RIGHT to (9, 5): S1 gets A4. I move UP to (8, 4) and get A5. Safe for both.\n*   If S1 moves DOWN to (8, 4): Collision at A5. Both die. S1 wins the game.\n\n**What is S1 likely to do?**\n\nSelf-preservation is key. If S1 perceives I am also moving for (8, 4) (which is highly likely since I moved to (8, 3)), S1 should choose the path where collision is impossible: RIGHT to (9, 5).\n\nIf S1 is purely maximizing apple count without considering collision consequence (unlikely for a competitive snake algorithm): S1 might try to get A5 just because it's slightly closer to the center of the board, potentially leading to more options later, or just picking one of the two options at random.\n\nHowever, given the proximity to A4 (9, 5), S1's move RIGHT to (9, 5) is strategically superior because it guarantees safety and an apple, whereas DOWN to (8, 4) guarantees a collision and death, resulting in a loss of the current lead (S1 wins by tie-breaker, but dies).\n\nSince S1 already prioritized a move (RIGHT on T20) that geometrically positions it better for A4 (9, 5) over A5 (8, 4) (as (8, 5) is directly adjacent to (9, 5) but less direct to (8, 4) than if S1 had moved to (7, 4)), S1 is likely committed to A4.\n\nI must take the optimal apple path, UP to (8, 4), banking on S1 choosing self-preservation and the guaranteed apple at A4.\n\nAlternative strategies:\n1. Move RIGHT to (9, 3): This keeps me alive, but cedes A5 to S1 if S1 moves DOWN. If S1 moves RIGHT, both apples remain for the next turn, but S1 is now at (9, 5) and will eat A4 and put pressure on me. Bad move.\n2. Move DOWN to (8, 2): Cedes A5, fails to advance. Bad move.\n\nConclusion: UP is the only move that keeps me in the game competitively. The risk of collision is symmetric, meaning a rational opponent should avoid it. I trust S1 to take A4.\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nTurn 21: My head is at (8, 3), adjacent to A5 (8, 4). Snake 1 is at (8, 5), adjacent to both A5 (8, 4) and A4 (9, 5). Moving UP to (8, 4) to eat A5 is the optimal move. Although S1 could move DOWN to (8, 4) resulting in a fatal head-on collision, S1 has a guaranteed apple and survival at (9, 5) by moving RIGHT. Given the collision symmetric nature of A5, a rational S1 should choose the safe option, RIGHT, allowing both apples A4 and A5 to be collected this turn. I will move UP.\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nUP",

Evaluate Safe Moves based on A5 (8, 7) Goal:**\n\nTo reach (8, 7), I need to move along x=8, meaning I need to move UP. However, (8, 5) is blocked by S1's body.

Collision and Strategy:**\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (9, 6):\nI need to position myself to move around the body segment at (8, 5) and get to (8, 6) or (7, 6).\n\n*   If I move **RIGHT to (9, 4)**: I am adjacent to S1's potential path (9, 6) and S1's current head (9, 5). (9, 6) will be open next turn if S1 moves up.\n    *   Turn 23 options from (9, 4): UP (9, 5) into S1's old head location/body (which might become tail if S1 grows and moves, but currently (9, 5) will be open IF S1 moves UP, but we must check if (9, 5) becomes S1's body). Since S1 ate, (2, 5) remains occupied, and (9, 5) becomes S1's head, (8, 5) becomes the first body segment, etc. Ah, S1 moves to (9, 6). The cells (9, 5) and (8, 5) are now S1's body segments. So moving to (9, 5) or (8, 5) is fatal. (9, 4) is below (9, 5) (S1's body).\n*   If I move **LEFT to (7, 4)**: I am further from S1's primary path.\n    *   Turn 23 options from (7, 4): UP (7, 5) (S1 body - FATAL), DOWN (7, 3) (My body - FATAL). LEFT (6, 4), RIGHT (8, 4) (My body - FATAL).\n    *   Wait, I need to check my body status. If I move LEFT to (7, 4):\n        *   My body is: (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3).\n        *   Moving to (7, 4) is safe.\n        *   Next Turn (T23): Head is (7, 4). My body moves (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3). Tail (5, 3) is free.\n        *   T23 options from (7, 4): UP (7, 5) (S1 body - FATAL), DOWN (7, 3) (My body - FATAL), LEFT (6, 4) (Safe), RIGHT (8, 4) (My body - FATAL).\n        *   If I move LEFT to (7, 4), I only have one safe move (LEFT to 6, 4) in the next turn (T23), leading to being severely trapped next to my own body fence. This is bad.\n\nLet's re-examine RIGHT to (9, 4).\n*   If I move **RIGHT to (9, 4)**:\n    *   My body moves: (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3). (5, 3) is free.\n    *   S1 moves UP to (9, 6). S1 body: (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5). (2, 5) remains occupied.\n    *   Next Turn (T23): Head is (9, 4).\n    *   T23 options from (9, 4): UP (9, 5) (S1 Body - FATAL). DOWN (9, 3) (Safe). LEFT (8, 4) (My Body - FATAL). RIGHT (Wall - FATAL).\n    *   This also leads to only one safe move (DOWN to 9, 3) and effectively traps me on the right edge. This is also bad.\n\nI must find a path that offers continuation towards A5 (8, 7) or A2 (4, 4) without trapping myself.\n\nBoth (7, 4) and (9, 4) lead to single-choice survival routes next turn, trapping me along my own body barrier (T-piece barrier at x=8 and x=7).\n\nLet's look for a temporary move that opens up movement. Since I just grew, my movement options are severely restricted by my length 5 body.\n\nInitial position (8, 4). Body: (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3).\n\nIf I move:\n1.  **LEFT (7, 4) -> T23 (6, 4)**: Allows escaping LEFT towards A2 (4, 4) or maneuvering for A5 (8, 7).\n    *   Turn 22: Move LEFT to (7, 4). Safe.\n    *   T23 safe moves from (7, 4): Only LEFT (6, 4) (as calculated above).\n    *   T24 safe moves from (6, 4): Body will be (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3). Tail (6, 3) is free.\n        *   (6, 5) is S1's body. (5, 4) is safe. (7, 4) is my body. (6, 3) is safe but restrictive.\n        *   (6, 4) allows LEFT (5, 4), UP (6, 5) X. DOWN (6, 3).\n        *   This path seems viable to move towards A2 (4, 4) or re-evaluate A5 (8, 7) later.\n\n2.  **RIGHT (9, 4) -> T23 (9, 3)**: Forces me further down the edge, away from A5 and A2.\n\nMoving LEFT (7, 4) seems better as it allows freedom towards the center/left side (A2).\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (9, 6):\nS1 is now pressuring A5 (8, 7). My attempt to reach A5 is blocked by S1's long vertical exclusion zone (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6).\n\nIf I go LEFT (7, 4), I can bypass S1's immediate control and head towards A2 (4, 4).\n\nD(0, A2) = 4 steps via (7, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (4, 4).\nD(1, A5) = 2 steps via (9, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (8, 7). (S1 reaches A5 on T24 by going UP/LEFT).\n\nIt is almost certain S1 will beat me to A5 (8, 7). I should pivot to A2 (4, 4).\n\nLet's re-confirm that LEFT (7, 4) only leads to LEFT (6, 4) in T23.\nT22 Move: LEFT to (7, 4).\nMy body shifts: (8, 4) -> (8, 3) -> (7, 3) -> (6, 3). Old tail (5, 3) is now free.\nNew Head (7, 4). New Body segments: (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3).\n\nT23 Potential moves from (7, 4):\n*   UP (7, 5): S1 body segment (7, 5). FATAL.\n*   DOWN (7, 3): My body segment (7, 3). FATAL.\n*   LEFT (6, 4): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (8, 4): My body segment (8, 4). FATAL.\n\nYes, (7, 4) leads to a forced LEFT (6, 4) next turn. This is acceptable as it advances toward A2 (4, 4) and avoids immediate danger.\n\nIf S1 surprises me and moves DOWN to (9, 4):\nS1 Head (9, 4). S1 body (9, 5), (8, 5), ...\nMy Head (7, 4).\nNo immediate collision threat. If S1 moves DOWN, I gain a possible maneuver space UP toward A5, but S1 would be closer to A2 (4, 4) than expected, giving S1 potential access via (8, 4) or (9, 3).\nIf S1 moves DOWN, I still prefer LEFT to (7, 4) to escape the cluster and preserve options towards A2.\n\nConclusion: Targeting A2 (4, 4) is the current survival priority and apple goal, as A5 (8, 7) is likely lost to Snake 1. Moving LEFT starts a safe bypass route.\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nTurn 22 strategy: Snake 1 (ID 1) is likely moving UP to (9, 6) to intercept A5 (8, 7). My path UP is blocked by S1's body segments at (8, 5). Moving LEFT to (7, 4) isolates Snake 0 from Snake 1 and commits to a path toward A2 (4, 4), which is 4 steps away. This move keeps S0 safe, although it forces a move of LEFT again on T23 due to temporary self-body constraints.\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nLEFT",

(6, 3) is free.\n\nFrom (6, 4):\n*   UP (6, 5): S1 body (6, 5) currently. S1 is moving, so (6, 5) will become S1's body segment (7, 5) or (6, 5). If S1 moves to (8, 6), S1's body segments shift: (9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5). The cell (3, 5) becomes free. (6, 5) remains occupied by S1's body. UP is dangerous/fatal.\n*   DOWN (6, 3): Tail location, safe.\n*   LEFT (5, 4): Safe. Moves toward A2 (4, 4).\n*   RIGHT (7, 4): My body segment (7, 4). FATAL.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 4) now, in the next turn (T24), I will have two good options: DOWN (6, 3, safe) or LEFT (5, 4, apple path). This is much better than the one-way street predicted if I had moved right two turns ago.\n\nThe move LEFT is required for safety and optimal for reaching the next viable apple (A2).\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nTurn 23 strategy: Based on the restricted state after growing last turn, only LEFT to (6, 4) is safe. This path is desirable as it directs Snake 0 toward Apple A2 (4, 4). Snake 1 is likely securing A5 (8, 7). The resulting position at (6, 4) will give two safe options next turn (LEFT toward A2, or DOWN into the cleared tail space) allowing for continued progression and avoiding deadlocks.\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nLEFT",

Decision for Snake 0:**\n\nThe path LEFT is available and leads straight onto Apple A2 (4, 4). This move is completely safe and guarantees an apple acquisition this turn, increasing my score to 5 and length to 6.\n\n**Short-term strategy (T25 to T26):**\nMove LEFT to (4, 4) to eat the apple. After eating (4, 4), my head will be at (4, 4). I will then look towards A4 (1, 5) or A1 (1, 0).\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nTurn 25 strategy: The direct path to the apple (4, 4) is open. Move LEFT to (4, 4). This maximizes apple collection and is completely safe from self-collision and enemy collision. Snake 0 will then have 5 apples and a length of 6, controlling the center-left.

This was the target planned last turn. Eating this apple will put me at 6 apples, reducing S1's lead (9 apples).\n\n**1. Evaluate Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head at (3, 5)):**\n\n*   **UP (3, 6):** Safe. Moves away from the apple.\n*   **DOWN (3, 4):** Safe. Towards my body segments (4, 4) but doesn't hit them immediately.\n*   **LEFT (2, 5):** Safe. This is Apple A4. **EATS APPLE.**\n*   **RIGHT (4, 5):** My body segment (4, 5) is occupied. **FATAL (Moving backwards).**\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**2. Analyze Optimal Move towards A4 (2, 5):**\n\nThe move LEFT to (2, 5) achieves the primary objective: eating the closest apple. This is the optimal move.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake #1 (Head at (7, 9)):**\n\nS1 is at (7, 9), having just eaten an apple. It needs a new target.\nS1 is long (L=10) and positioned along the right wall.\n\nPossible apples for S1:\n*   A5 (6, 2): Distance 8 (1 Left, 7 Down).\n*   A3 (7, 0): Distance 9 (9 Down).\n*   A2 (1, 5): Distance 10.\n*   A1 (1, 0): Distance 15.\n\nS1's safe moves from (7, 9):\n*   UP (7, 10): Off board. **FATAL.**\n*   DOWN (7, 8): S1's body segment (7, 8) is occupied. **FATAL.**\n*   LEFT (6, 9): Safe. Moves toward A5 (6, 2).\n*   RIGHT (8, 9): Safe.\n\nS1 must move LEFT or RIGHT. Since S1 is maximizing score, moving LEFT to (6, 9) seems most likely, as it aligns S1 to move down the board toward A5 (6, 2) or A3 (7, 0) (e.g., L to (6, 9), then D to (6, 8), (6, 7), etc., or D to (7, 8) if I wasn't there, but it is occupied). Since DOWN is impossible due to S1's own body, S1 will very likely move LEFT (6, 9) or RIGHT (8, 9). LEFT is structurally better for S1 to find new apples.\n\nThis predicted movement (S1 to (6, 9) or (8, 9)) is far from my intended move (LEFT to (2, 5)). There is no collision risk.\n\n**4. Post-Apple Strategy (Turn 29 onwards):**\n\nAfter eating A4 (2, 5), my head will be at (2, 5). I will have grown to length 8.\nThe next closest apple is A2 (1, 5) (Distance 1, LEFT).\n\nPlan for T29: Move LEFT from (2, 5) to (1, 5) to eat A2. (Assuming no unexpected constraints arise).\n\nThis turn, the choice is clearly LEFT.\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nTurn 28 Strategy: Move LEFT to (2, 5) to eat Apple A4. This is the easiest target and reduces S1's lead.\nTurn 29 Strategy: Move LEFT from (2, 5) to (1, 5) to retrieve Apple A2. This keeps me safely in the top-left area, maximizing my length and score before engaging with the scattered apples (A1, A3, A5) farther away, which S1 might pursue.\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nLEFT",

S1 is long (L=10) and is positioned near the top edge.\n\nPossible apples for S1 from (6, 9):\n*   A4 (6, 2): Distance 7 (7 Down). - Very close and direct.\n*   A5 (9, 8): Distance 4 (3 Right, 1 Down). - Also attractive.\n*   A3 (7, 0): Distance 9.\n\nS1's safe moves from (6, 9):\n*   UP (6, 10): Off board. **FATAL.**\n*   DOWN (6, 8): Safe. Moves toward A4 (6, 2).\n*   LEFT (5, 9): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (7, 9): My body segment (7, 9) is occupied. Wait, no, (7, 9) is S1's body segment 1. **FATAL (Moving backwards).**\n\nS1 must move DOWN or LEFT.\nIf S1 prioritizes A4 (6, 2), it will move DOWN to (6, 8).\nIf S1 prioritizes A5 (9, 8), it might move LEFT to (5, 9) then try to wrap around or go down the board centerline, but DOWN is a much more direct move towards an apple (A4).\n\nPrediction: S1 moves DOWN to (6, 8) to pursue A4 (6, 2).\n\n**4. Collision Check (My move LEFT to (1, 5)):**\n\n*   My new head position: (1, 5).\n*   S1's predicted new head position: (6, 8).\n*   These positions are nowhere near each other. No collision risk.\n\n**5. Post-Apple Strategy (Turn 30 onwards):**\n\nAfter eating A2 (1, 5), my head will be at (1, 5). I will have grown to length 8.\nThe next closest apple is A1 (1, 0) (Distance 5, DOWN). This is an easy target along the left wall.\nS1 is likely moving towards A4 (6, 2).\n\nPlan for T30: Move DOWN from (1, 5) to (1, 4), then continue moving down the left edge to A1 (1, 0).\n\nThe choice for T29 is clearly LEFT.\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nTurn 29 Strategy: Move LEFT to (1, 5) to eat Apple A2. This moves me to 7 apples, closing S1's lead (S1 has 9).\nTurn 30-34 Strategy: Move DOWN towards A1 (1, 0) via the safe path down the left wall (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0). This is a guaranteed 8th apple for me.\nS1 is predicted to go for A4 (6, 2) or A5 (9, 8). If S1 gets A4, the competition will shift to A3 (7, 0).

Apples: 9.\n    *   Body: [(6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5)]\n    *   Tail (8, 5) will become free this turn if S1 does not eat.\n*   **Apples Remaining (A):**\n    *   A1: (1, 0) - Closest to me.\n    *   A2: (7, 0)\n    *   A3: (6, 2)\n    *   A4: (9, 8)\n    *   A5: (3, 8)\n\nMy position (1, 5) is on the left edge. The previous move secured (1, 5), meaning I just ate A2 from the previous turn's map. Now I must proceed towards A1 (1, 0).\n\n**1. Evaluate Immediate Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head at (1, 5)):**\n\n*   **UP (1, 6):** Safe. Moves away from A1.\n*   **DOWN (1, 4):** Safe. Moves directly towards A1 (1, 0).\n*   **LEFT (0, 5):** Safe. Keeps alignment with A1.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 5):** My body segment (2, 5) is occupied. **FATAL (Moving backwards).**\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**2. Analyze Optimal Move towards A1 (1, 0):**\n\nA1 is 5 steps away: (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0).\nMoving DOWN to (1, 4) is the most direct path along the safe boundary.\n\nMoving LEFT to (0, 5) is also viable, but slightly less direct as it puts me on the grid wall, slightly further from the path to (1, 0). From (0, 5), I would move DOWN to (0, y) and then RIGHT to (1, 0) at the end, or stay in x=0 column until y=0. If I move DOWN to (1, 4), I can stay in x=1 column. This seems preferable.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake #1 (Head at (6, 8)):**\n\nS1 is at (6, 8). S1 is likely focusing on A3 (6, 2) (6 steps away, straight down) or A4 (9, 8) (3 steps away). A4 is closer. A5 (3, 8) is also close (3 steps away).\n\nPossible moves for S1 (6, 8):\n*   UP (6, 9): S1's body segment (6, 9) is occupied. **FATAL (Moving backwards).**\n*   DOWN (6, 7): Safe. Moves toward A3 (6, 2).\n*   LEFT (5, 8): Safe. Moves toward A5 (3, 8).\n*   RIGHT (7, 8): S1's body segment (7, 8) is occupied. Wait, (7, 8) is body segment 3: [(6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8)...]. This would be moving backward into segment (7, 8).\n    Let's check the body list for S1: [(6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (8, 8)...]. The head is (6, 8). The segment immediately behind the head is (6, 9).\n    S1's actual move history to get to (6, 8) must have been from (6, 9) (DOWN), or (7, 8) (LEFT), or (5, 8) (RIGHT), or (6, 7) (UP).\n    The list states: Head: (6, 8), Body: [(6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), ...]. This means S1 moved into (6, 8) from (6, 7), (5, 8), or (7, 8). Since the segment immediately behind the head is (6, 9), S1 entered (6, 8) from a cell that *was* (6, 9) one turn ago, meaning the old head position was (6, 9) and S1 moved DOWN to (6, 8).\n\n    If S1 came from (6, 9) (i.e., S1 moved DOWN last turn):\n    *   UP (6, 9): **FATAL (Moving backwards)**.\n    *   DOWN (6, 7): Safe. Towards A3 (6, 2).\n    *   LEFT (5, 8): Safe. Towards A5 (3, 8).\n    *   RIGHT (7, 8): Safe. (7, 8) is S1's body segment 3. Segment 2 is (7, 9). Segment 1 is (6, 9). S1 can move to (7, 8).\n\n    S1 has three safe options: DOWN (6, 7), LEFT (5, 8), RIGHT (7, 8).\n    *   (6, 7) leads to A3 (6, 2), 5 steps.\n    *   (5, 8) leads to A5 (3, 8), 2 steps.\n    *   (7, 8) leads to A4 (9, 8), 2 steps + 2 steps = 4 steps (e.g., (7, 8) -> (8, 8) -> (9, 8) or (7, 8) -> (7, 9) -> (8, 9) -> (9, 9) -> (9, 8)). Wait, (8, 8) is S1's body. (9, 8) is A4. (7, 8) is safe for S1 to move to. If S1 moves RIGHT to (7, 8), the path to A4 (9, 8) is slightly complex since (8, 8) is body. S1 would need to go (7, 8) -> (7, 7) -> (8, 7) -> (9, 7) -> (9, 8). No, (8, 7) and (9, 7) are body.\n\n    Let's look at the density near apples:\n    *   A5 (3, 8): (6, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (4, 8) -> (3, 8). 3 moves. (5, 8) is safe.\n    *   A4 (9, 8): (6, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (8, 8) is body. S1 would need a longer route. (6, 8) -> (6, 7) -> ... The proximity makes LEFT or DOWN the most likely moves.\n\n    A5 (3, 8) seems the most easily reachable (LEFT, LEFT, LEFT).\n    A3 (6, 2) is straight DOWN.\n\n    I predict S1 will move LEFT to (5, 8) to secure A5 (3, 8).\n\n**4. Collision Check (My move DOWN to (1, 4)):**\n\n*   My new head position: (1, 4).\n*   S1's predicted new head position: (5, 8).\n*   No collision risk.\n\n**5. Alternative Exploration (My move LEFT to (0, 5)):**\n\n*   My new head position: (0, 5).\n*   S1's predicted new head position: (5, 8).\n*   No collision risk.\n\nMoving DOWN to (1, 4) keeps me in the fastest path to A1 (1, 0). It also keeps the route along the left side secured, preventing S1 from trying to cut down the board center towards A1 prematurely. Given the distance, A1 is safely mine.\n\n**6. Long-Term Strategy:**\n\n1.  Move DOWN to (1, 4).\n2.  Continue DOWN to (1, 0), eating A1. (T33/T34).\n3.  After eating A1, my head will be at (1, 0). I will have 8 apples. S1 is likely to have 10 or 11 apples by then.\n4.  The next closest apple is A2 (7, 0) or A3 (6, 2). From (1, 0), A2 is 6 steps RIGHT. A3 is 5 steps (5 right, 2 up). A2 is the easier target. I will then aim across the bottom edge toward A2 (7, 0).\n\nThe current choice is clearly DOWN.\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nTurn 30 Strategy: Move DOWN to (1, 4) to continue the path towards Apple A1 (1, 0). This is the fastest, safest way to secure my 8th apple and catch up to S1. S1 is predicted to target A5 (3, 8) or A3 (6, 2).\nTurn 31-34 Strategy: Move (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0) to eat A1.\nTurn 35 onwards: Shift focus to A2 (7, 0) along the bottom edge.\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nDOWN",

Analyze Optimal Move towards A1 (1, 0):**\n\nMoving DOWN directly to (1, 0) secures Apple A1, increases my score to 8, and increases my length to 9. This is the goal for this turn.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake #1 (Head at (3, 9)):**\n\nS1 is at (3, 9). S1 is heavily favored to move toward A4 (9, 8) or perhaps try to move toward the center/right. Note the board geometry: (3, 9) is on the top edge.\n\nS1's possible safe moves from (3, 9):\n*   UP (3, 10): **OUT OF BOUNDS.** **FATAL.**\n*   DOWN (3, 8): S1's body segment (3, 8) is occupied. **FATAL (Moving backwards).**\n*   LEFT (2, 9): Safe. Moves away from apples A4.\n*   RIGHT (4, 9): Safe. Moves towards apples A4 (9, 8).\n\nS1 is effectively restricted to moving LEFT or RIGHT along the top edge.\n*   If S1 moves RIGHT to (4, 9), it is 5 steps away from A4 (9, 8) and moving in the right direction. This is the most likely move.\n*   If S1 moves LEFT to (2, 9), it moves away from the nearest apples.\n\n**4.

Alternative Moves Analysis:**\n\nAny move other than DOWN delays eating the apple and is suboptimal.\n\n**6. Conclusion:**\n\nThe move DOWN to (1, 0) is the optimal, safe, and necessary step to eat Apple A1.\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nTurn 34 Strategy: Move DOWN to (1, 0) and eat A1.

Given the clear path along Y=0 to A2, A2 (7, 0) is the next priority. S1 is likely moving RIGHT along the top edge toward A4 (9, 8).

Analyze Optimal Move towards Next Target Apple (A1 at (7, 0)):**\n\n*   Head at (2, 0).\n*   Target A1 at (7, 0).\n*   Distance: 5 steps.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 0) directly reduces the distance to A1.\nMoving UP to (2, 1) increases the distance from A1.\n\nMove RIGHT is clearly optimal for reaching A1 next.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake #1 (Head at (5, 9)):**\n\nS1 Head is at (5, 9). Neck is (4, 9).\nS1's possible moves:\n1. UP (5, 10): OOB. **FATAL.**\n2. DOWN (5, 8): S1 body segment (5, 8) is occupied. **FATAL.** (Body list: ... (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8) ...)\n3. LEFT (4, 9): Moving backwards into neck. **FATAL.**\n4. RIGHT (6, 9): Safe.\n\nS1 is once again heavily restricted. The only safe move is RIGHT to (6, 9). This continues S1's movement along the top edge, positioning it extremely well for A3 (9, 8) or A5 (8, 9).\n\n**4. Collision Check (My move RIGHT to (3, 0)):**\n\n*   My new head position: (3, 0).\n*   S1's likely new head position: (6, 9).\n*   No possibility of collision. My move is safe.\n\n**5. Alternative Moves Analysis:**\n\nMoving UP to (2, 1) is safe but takes me away from the target apple (7, 0). It also risks me running into the large body mass of my snake (columns 1 and 2, rows 1 through 5). Since the path RIGHT is clear, I should take it.\n\n**6. Conclusion:**\n\nThe strategy remains to move along row 0 towards apple A1 (7, 0).\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nTurn 36 Strategy: Move RIGHT to (3, 0) towards A1 (7, 0). S1 is likely moving RIGHT to (6, 9) towards A3/A5.\nTurn 37 Strategy: Move RIGHT to (4, 0).\nTurn 38 Strategy: Move RIGHT to (5, 0).\nTurn 39 Strategy: Move RIGHT to (6, 0).\nTurn 40 Strategy: Move RIGHT to (7, 0) and eat A1.\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",
