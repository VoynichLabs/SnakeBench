Most likely it will go for apples. The apple at (6,4) might attract it. No chance of head-on collision this turn from my possible moves.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Collect the apple at (2,2) to increase score to 2. Then consider moving toward the apple cluster at (6,4) or (4,0), while monitoring enemy movement. The enemy is currently in the upper half, so maybe target (4,0) or (9,5) to avoid conflict initially.

(1,7) is the closest in Manhattan distance (6 vs 4 vs 6), but (4,0) is also 4 away.\n2. **Enemy position:** Enemy at (4,5) is 3 cells away vertically and 2 horizontally.

Moving UP (2,3) gets me closer to (6,4) and (9,9). Given my score lead (2 vs 1), I should prioritize safe growth and maintaining options.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Since I have a score lead, I should play safely and aim for apples that are less contested. The apple at (4,0) is relatively isolated and the enemy is far away in the upper half. Moving DOWN positions me toward it while keeping options open. Moving UP or LEFT also works, but DOWN seems most direct toward an apple while avoiding the enemy's likely path toward (6,4) or (9,5).\n\n**Final decision:** DOWN is safe, moves toward apple (4,0), and maintains good future mobility.\n\nDOWN",

Length = 3.\n**Enemy snake #0:** Head at (4,4), body segment at (4,5). Length = 2.\n**Apples:** (6,4), (4,0), (9,9), (9,5), (1,7)\n\n**Safety check from head (2,1):**\n- **UP** to (2,2): This is my own body segment (the one immediately behind my head). Moving into it would kill me. **UNSAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (2,0): Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (1,1): Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (3,1): Empty. Safe.\n\nSo UP is eliminated.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n1. **Apple proximity:** The closest apples are (4,0) (2 steps down, 2 right) and (1,7) (6 up, 1 left). (4,0) is Manhattan distance 4, (1,7) is distance 7. The apple at (4,0) is the most accessible.\n2. **Enemy position:** Enemy at (4,4) is 3 cells away vertically and 2 horizontally. No immediate collision risk this turn. From (4,4), it could move UP to (4,5) (its own body, unsafe), DOWN to (4,3), LEFT to (3,4), or RIGHT to (5,4). It might aim for the apple at (6,4) or (9,5).\n3. **Future mobility:** From (2,1), moving DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT all keep me safe. Moving DOWN to (2,0) gets me closer to (4,0) but leaves me on the bottom edge, which could limit options. Moving LEFT to (1,1) or RIGHT to (3,1) keeps me more central.\n4. **Avoiding potential head-on collisions:** I need to consider where the enemy might move. If I move DOWN to (2,0), the enemy is unlikely to go there. If I move LEFT to (1,1), enemy could move LEFT to (3,4) or DOWN to (4,3) \u2013 no collision risk. If I move RIGHT to (3,1), enemy could move DOWN to (4,3) or LEFT to (3,4) \u2013 a move to (3,4) is two steps away from my (3,1), so no immediate head-on risk.\n5. **Path to apples:** Moving DOWN directly toward (4,0) is tempting, but I should also consider the apple at (6,4). Moving RIGHT positions me better to eventually go up toward (6,4) while staying flexible. Given my score lead (2 vs 1), I can afford to be cautious and not rush straight down.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Maintain my apple lead by playing safely. The enemy is in the upper half, so the lower-left area (around (4,0)) is relatively safe territory. I'll start moving toward (4,0) but not commit fully to the edge yet. Moving RIGHT to (3,1) keeps me closer to the center and allows me to go DOWN next turn to (3,0) or continue toward the right-side apples later. It avoids the immediate risk of moving onto my own body and keeps all future directions open from (3,1).\n\n**Final decision:** RIGHT is safe, maintains central position and future options, and doesn't box me in.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving into it would kill me. **UNSAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (4,1): Empty. **SAFE**.\n\nSo LEFT is eliminated.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n1.  **Apple proximity:** The closest apple is (4,0), which is 1 step down and 1 step right from my head (Manhattan distance 2). The apple at (6,4) is 3 steps right and 3 steps up (distance 6). (4,0) is very attractive.\n2.  **Enemy position:** Enemy head is at (4,3). From there, it could move UP to (4,4) (its own body, unsafe), DOWN to (4,2), LEFT to (3,3), or RIGHT to (5,3). It is 2 cells away vertically and 1 horizontally from me. A head-on collision is possible if I move RIGHT to (4,1) and it moves DOWN to (4,2) \u2014 our heads would not meet this turn. The risk is if I move RIGHT and it moves LEFT to (3,3), we are still not colliding. The immediate collision risk is low.\n3.  **Future mobility & path to (4,0):** To reach (4,0), I need to move RIGHT then DOWN, or DOWN then RIGHT. Moving DOWN to (3,0) gets me directly underneath it, but then I'd have to move RIGHT into (4,0) next turn. That's a clear, safe two-step plan. Moving RIGHT to (4,1) positions me to the left of it, requiring a DOWN move next turn. Both are valid.\n4.  **Avoiding traps:** Moving UP to (3,2) takes me away from the closest apple and offers no immediate advantage. My tail is at (2,2), so moving UP doesn't box me in, but it's less efficient.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:** Secure the easy apple at (4,0). After eating it, my body will grow, and my tail will remain at (2,2) for a turn. I should then assess the board from (4,0) or (4,1) and consider moving toward the center or the apple at (6,4). Maintain my apple lead (2 vs 1) by playing safely and controlling space.\n\n**Decision:** The safest and most direct path to the nearest apple is DOWN to (3,0). This move is safe, avoids the enemy's immediate vicinity, and sets up a guaranteed apple capture next turn unless the enemy intervenes (which is unlikely as they are far above). It's more direct than moving RIGHT first.\n\nDOWN",

Moving into it would kill me. **UNSAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (3,-1): This is off the board (y-coordinate -1). **UNSAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (2,0): Empty. **SAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (4,0): Contains an apple. **SAFE** (eating an apple is safe; collision with apple is good).\n\nSo UP and DOWN are eliminated.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n1. **Apple at (4,0):** Moving RIGHT directly eats the apple. This increases my score to 3 apples, extends my lead over the enemy (1 apple), and causes my snake to grow next turn. This is highly advantageous.\n2. **Enemy Position:** Enemy head is at (4,2). From there, it could move UP to (4,3) (its own body, unsafe), DOWN to (4,1), LEFT to (3,2), or RIGHT to (5,2). If I move RIGHT to (4,0), the enemy could move DOWN to (4,1). That would put its head adjacent to my new head at (4,0), but not in the same cell. No immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n3. **Future Mobility:** After eating the apple at (4,0), my head will be at (4,0), my body will be [(3,0), (3,1), (2,1)] plus a new tail segment added next turn (my tail stays at (2,1) for this turn, then grows). From (4,0), my possible moves next turn would be UP to (4,1), LEFT to (3,0), or RIGHT to (5,0). DOWN is off-board. That gives me two safe moves (UP and RIGHT likely, depending on enemy).

From (2,0), I could then go UP to (2,1) (my body, unsafe next turn), RIGHT to (3,0) (body), or LEFT to (1,0) (empty). That would corner me. It's a poor choice compared to eating the apple.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:** After eating the apple at (4,0), my immediate priority is to avoid getting trapped. From (4,0), I should consider moving UP to (4,1) if safe, to gain more space and potentially target the apple at (6,4) or (1,7). I must monitor the enemy's movement from (4,2); if it moves DOWN to (4,1), that could block me. I may need to go RIGHT to (5,0) to stay safe and loop around. Maintaining my apple lead is key.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT is safe, eats an apple, increases my score, and is the most strategically sound move.\n\nRIGHT",

This is a **head-on collision** if the enemy stays or moves into that cell. Since moves are simultaneous, if the enemy moves away (e.g., left, right, or down), I could survive, but if it stays or moves into (4,1), we both die. This is **highly risky** and likely unsafe given the enemy is adjacent.\n- **DOWN to (4,-1):** Off the board (y-coordinate -1). **UNSAFE**.\n- **LEFT to (3,0):** Contains my own body (the segment immediately behind my head). Moving into it would kill me. **UNSAFE**.\n- **RIGHT to (5,0):** Empty. **SAFE**.\n\nSo only **RIGHT** is definitely safe. **UP** is risky and depends on the enemy's move; it's not guaranteed safe.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy's possible moves from (4,1):**\nThe enemy can move UP to (4,2) (its own body, unsafe), DOWN to (4,0) (my current head position, but I'll be moving), LEFT to (3,1) (my body segment, unsafe for it), or RIGHT to (5,1) (empty). Its only safe moves are **RIGHT to (5,1)** or possibly **DOWN to (4,0)** if I move away. If it moves DOWN to (4,0) and I move RIGHT to (5,0), we avoid collision. If I moved UP to (4,1) and it moved DOWN to (4,0), we'd swap positions\u2014which, according to the rules, causes both snakes to die. So UP is dangerous.\n\n**Step 3: Strategic evaluation of RIGHT:**\nMoving RIGHT to (5,0) is safe and keeps me alive. It doesn't eat an apple immediately, but it opens up future moves: from (5,0) I could go UP to (5,1) (but note enemy might move to (5,1)), LEFT back to (4,0) (empty now), or RIGHT to (6,0) (empty). I need to be cautious of the enemy's potential move to (5,1). The closest apple is at (6,4), which is several moves away. My lead in apples (3 vs 1) is good, so survival is paramount.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan for next few turns:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (5,0), my priority is to avoid being trapped by the enemy and to gradually work toward an apple. The enemy, if it moves RIGHT to (5,1), will be adjacent to my possible UP move. I should consider moving RIGHT again to (6,0) or LEFT back to (4,0) to create distance. The apple at (3,5) might be reachable by moving up the left side, but I need to navigate around my own body and the enemy. My body at (3,1) and (2,1) blocks some paths. I should aim to circle around the board's perimeter to collect apples while keeping the enemy at bay.\n\n**Decision:** Only RIGHT is guaranteed safe. UP is too risky due to potential head-on collision or swap-death. Survival is the top priority.\n\nRIGHT",

This creates distance from the enemy. The closest apple is at (6,4), which is four moves away (up). I have a lead in apples (3 vs 1), so survival is key.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan for next few turns:**\nAfter moving to (6,0), I should consider moving up the right side of the board toward the apple at (6,4). I need to be aware of the enemy's position and avoid being cut off. The enemy might move toward the apple at (3,5) or (1,7). My body at (3,1) and (3,0) partially blocks the left side, so I should favor the right side for now. Next turn, from (6,0), UP to (6,1) is likely safe if the enemy doesn't move there. I'll need to monitor the enemy's movements closely.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT is the only guaranteed safe move. UP is too risky due to potential head-on collision.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples are at (6,4), (9,9), (9,5), (1,7), (3,5).\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (7,1):**\n- **UP to (7,2):** Empty. **SAFE.**\n- **DOWN to (7,0):** Contains my own body. **UNSAFE.**\n- **LEFT to (6,1):** Empty. **SAFE.**\n- **RIGHT to (8,1):** Empty. **SAFE.**\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy's possible moves from (6,3):**\nEnemy can move UP to (6,4) (apple), DOWN to (6,2) (its own body), LEFT to (5,3), RIGHT to (7,3). Its safe moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. It is likely to move UP toward the apple at (6,4). If it does, it will be at (6,4) next turn. If I move UP to (7,2), I will be adjacent to (7,3) which is a possible enemy move (RIGHT from (6,3)), but no immediate collision this turn. A head-on collision would only occur if we move into the same cell simultaneously. The only overlapping safe cell between my moves and its possible moves is (7,3) if I go RIGHT and it goes RIGHT? Let's check: My RIGHT from (7,1) is (8,1). Its RIGHT from (6,3) is (7,3). No overlap. So no immediate head-on collision risk with any of my safe moves.\n\n**Step 3: Strategic evaluation and apple targeting:**\nI have 3 apples vs enemy's 1. My plan was to move toward the cluster of apples. The closest apple is at (6,4), which is two steps away: I could go LEFT then UP, or UP then LEFT. However, the enemy is at (6,3) and is likely to move UP to (6,4) this very turn to eat it. If I try to race for it, I'd need to move LEFT to (6,1) this turn, then UP to (6,2) next, but the enemy's body is at (6,2) \u2014 that's unsafe next turn. So (6,4) is probably going to be taken by the enemy. Better to target other apples.\n\nThe apple at (9,5) is reachable by moving right and up. The apple at (9,9) is far. The apple at (3,5) is left and up, but moving left puts me closer to my own body trail. The apple at (1,7) is far left/top.\n\nGiven my lead, I should play safely and maintain board control. Moving **UP** to (7,2) continues upward, opening central options. Moving **RIGHT** to (8,1) moves along the bottom-right area, but might lead toward (9,5). Moving **LEFT** to (6,1) moves toward the center-left but is closer to my body trail and the enemy.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility:**\nFrom (7,2) (if I go UP), next turn I could go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT \u2014 all likely open. From (8,1) (if I go RIGHT), next turn I could go UP, RIGHT, or possibly DOWN (but DOWN is (8,0), which is empty now). Both are good. LEFT to (6,1) gives options UP, LEFT, DOWN \u2014 but DOWN is (6,0) which is my body, so actually only UP and LEFT.\n\nI think UP is slightly better because it keeps me moving toward the upper half where apples are, and avoids the bottom edge where I have less room.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:** From (7,2), continue moving up/right toward apples (9,5) and (9,9). Monitor enemy position \u2014 if it eats (6,4), it will grow and be at (6,4) with a longer body. Avoid getting trapped in corners. Keep distance.\n\n**Decision:** UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are all safe. UP aligns with my previous plan and moves toward apple-rich area while maintaining good options.\n\nUP",

Its safe moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. It is likely to move UP toward the apple at (3,5) or (9,5), or RIGHT toward the center.

The only potential head-on collision cell is if I go RIGHT to (8,2) and it goes... no overlap. So both my safe moves avoid immediate head-on collision.\n\n**Step 3: Strategic evaluation and apple targeting:**\nI have 3 apples vs enemy's 2. The closest apple is at (9,5), which is 5 steps away (right 2, up 3). The apple at (9,9) is far. The apple at (3,5) is left/up, but moving left is unsafe. The apple at (1,7) is far left/top. The apple at (0,9) is top-left corner.\n\nMoving **UP** to (7,3) progresses upward, getting me closer to the upper row of apples (especially (9,5) and (9,9)) while staying in the central column. From (7,3), next turn I'll have options UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN would be my body at (7,2) next turn? Actually, if I move up, my body will shift: new head at (7,3), body becomes [(7,2), (7,1), (7,0)]? Wait, I grow only if I eat an apple. I haven't eaten one this turn, so my tail will move. My current tail is at (6,0). After moving without eating, my new body will be: head at new position, then the old head (7,2), then (7,1), then (7,0) \u2014 the tail (6,0) disappears. So from (7,3), DOWN to (7,2) will be my own body next turn, so not safe. So from (7,3), safe moves would be UP, LEFT, RIGHT. That's still good.\n\nMoving **RIGHT** to (8,2) moves me toward the right edge and closer to (9,5). From (8,2), next turn I could go UP, RIGHT, or DOWN (since (8,1) is empty now, and my body will be at [(7,2), (7,1), (7,0)] so (8,1) is safe). That gives three options as well.\n\nBoth are safe and offer good mobility. However, moving UP keeps me more central and offers a clearer path to multiple apples. Moving RIGHT edges me closer to the wall, which could limit future options if I'm not careful.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan for next turns:**\nFrom (7,3), I can continue upward toward the apples at (9,5) and (9,9). I should monitor the enemy's position\u2014if it moves toward (3,5), we may not intersect soon. Avoid getting trapped against the right wall. Keep distance from the enemy's possible path.\n\nGiven my lead, I should prioritize safety and maintaining options. UP seems slightly better because it avoids the right edge for now and keeps me in a more open area.\n\n**Decision:** UP and RIGHT are safe. UP aligns with moving toward the cluster of apples in the top-right while maintaining central flexibility.\n\n**Final move:** UP",

Its safe moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. It is likely to move toward the apple at (3,5) (LEFT/UP) or (9,5) (RIGHT).

Moving **RIGHT** to (8,3) gets me one step closer to (9,5) and also positions me to potentially go up the right side. Moving **UP** to (7,4) also progresses upward but is more central.\n\nFrom (8,3), my next safe moves would likely be UP, RIGHT, DOWN (since my body will shift, leaving (8,2) empty).

Moving RIGHT edges me closer to the right wall, but from (8,3) I can still maneuver. The enemy is on the left side, so moving right creates distance. The apple at (9,5) is valuable and reachable in a few turns if I commit right/up.\n\nHowever, I must also consider that moving RIGHT now might limit future upward movement if I get pinned against the top-right corner. But with 150 turns total and only turn 12, I have time to navigate.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe and offer good future options. RIGHT seems slightly more aggressive toward the nearest high-value apple, while UP is more conservative.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** If I go RIGHT to (8,3), next turn I should consider moving UP toward (9,5) unless the enemy's movement blocks that path. Keep monitoring enemy's head to avoid head-on collisions.\n\n**Decision:** Both moves are viable. I'll choose **RIGHT** to actively close the distance to the apple at (9,5) and use my lead to pressure the board.\n\nRIGHT",

Its safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. It is likely to move toward the apple at (9,5) (RIGHT/UP) or (3,5) (LEFT, but blocked).

The closest apple is at **(9,5)**, which is 2 steps away from (8,3) (right 1, up 2). The apple at (9,9) is farther. Moving **RIGHT** to (9,3) gets me to the right wall, then I'd need to go UP twice to reach (9,5). Moving **UP** to (8,4) gets me closer vertically, then I could go RIGHT to (9,4) and UP to (9,5). Moving **DOWN** to (8,2) moves me away from the closest apples.\n\nFrom (9,3), my next safe moves would be UP, DOWN, LEFT (RIGHT is wall). That's okay but pins me to the wall. From (8,4), my next safe moves would likely be UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN would be my body at (8,3) after shift), giving good mobility. From (8,2), I'd have UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is wall), but I'm farther from apples.\n\n**Step 4: Long-term plan for next turns:**\nGiven my lead, I should prioritize safety and maintaining access to apples. Moving UP to (8,4) keeps me central and offers more future options. Moving RIGHT to (9,3) edges me against the wall, which could limit escape if the enemy approaches. The enemy is at (7,5) and may move toward (9,5). If I go to (9,3) and the enemy goes to (8,5), we could converge near (9,5) next turn, increasing collision risk.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe and progress toward (9,5). UP seems better for maintaining flexibility. DOWN is safe but less productive.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** If I go UP to (8,4), next turn I should consider moving RIGHT toward (9,5) if safe, or continue UP toward (9,9) if the enemy blocks the right path. Monitor enemy's head to avoid head-on collisions.\n\n**Decision:** UP keeps more options open and safely progresses toward the apple cluster on the right side.\n\nUP",

Apples are at (9,9), (9,5), (1,7), (3,5), (0,9).\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (8,4):**\n- **UP to (8,5):** Contains enemy snake #0's head. **HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK** \u2013 if enemy stays or moves into that cell, we both die. This is dangerous and should be avoided unless we predict enemy will vacate. **UNSAFE.**\n- **DOWN to (8,3):** Contains my own body (the segment that was my head last turn). **UNSAFE.**\n- **LEFT to (7,4):** Empty. **SAFE.**\n- **RIGHT to (9,4):** Empty. **SAFE.**\n\nSafe moves: LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy's possible moves from (8,5):**\nEnemy can move UP to (8,6), DOWN to (8,4) (which is my head's current cell \u2013 but I will move away), LEFT to (7,5) (its own body), RIGHT to (9,5) (apple). Its safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. It is likely to move toward the apple at (9,5) (RIGHT) or possibly DOWN toward my previous position. If it moves RIGHT to (9,5), it will eat the apple and grow. If it moves DOWN to (8,4), that's where I am now, but I will have moved, so no collision unless I move into it. Since I am not moving UP into (8,5), a head-on collision is only possible if I move RIGHT to (9,4) and enemy moves DOWN to (8,4)? No, that's not head-on. The immediate head-on risk is if I go UP to (8,5) and enemy stays or moves into it. I've already eliminated UP.\n\n**Step 3: Strategic evaluation and apple targeting:**\nI have a lead (3 apples vs 2). The closest apple is at **(9,5)**, which is 1 step away from my RIGHT move to (9,4) \u2013 then next turn I could go UP to (9,5). However, enemy is at (8,5) and may also move RIGHT to (9,5) this turn. If both of us target (9,5) this turn, I would move to (9,4) and enemy to (9,5) \u2013 no collision. Next turn, if I move UP to (9,5), enemy might be there (having just eaten the apple and grown). That could cause a head-on collision if enemy stays, or if enemy moves away. Risky.\n\nThe apple at (9,9) is farther. The apple at (3,5) is across the board. Moving LEFT to (7,4) moves me toward the center and away from the immediate competition for (9,5). It also keeps me closer to other apples like (1,7) and (3,5) in the long run.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility and safety:**\nFrom (7,4), my next safe moves would likely be UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT? Let's check: UP to (7,5) is enemy body (snake #0's body segment at (7,5)) \u2013 unsafe. DOWN to (7,3) is my own body? Actually, my body after moving: if I move LEFT to (7,4), my body becomes [(8,4), (8,3), (7,3)]? Wait, careful: after moving LEFT to (7,4), my new head is (7,4). My body shifts: the old head (8,4) becomes first body segment, then (8,3), then (7,3) as tail. So DOWN to (7,3) would be moving into my own new body (the tail segment) \u2013 unsafe. LEFT to (6,4) is empty. RIGHT to (8,4) is my own new body (the first segment) \u2013 unsafe. So from (7,4), only UP and LEFT might be safe? UP is enemy body, so actually only LEFT to (6,4) is safe. That's very restrictive \u2013 moving LEFT could lead to a trap.\n\nFrom (9,4), after moving: my new head is (9,4). My body becomes [(8,4), (8,3), (7,3)]. Next turn, possible moves from (9,4): UP to (9,5) \u2013 might be apple or enemy, need to check then. DOWN to (9,3) \u2013 empty. LEFT to (8,4) \u2013 my own body. RIGHT is wall. So from (9,4), UP and DOWN are safe (if UP is safe regarding enemy). That gives two options.\n\nThus, RIGHT to (9,4) offers better future mobility (two safe directions) than LEFT to (7,4) (only one safe direction). Also, being at the right edge isn't ideal, but I can move down along the wall if needed.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan:**\nGiven my apple lead, I should prioritize safety and avoid risky engagements. Moving RIGHT to (9,4) keeps me safe this turn and gives options next turn. I can then decide based on whether enemy eats (9,5). If enemy eats (9,5) and stays, I can move DOWN to (9,3) to avoid collision and target other apples. If enemy moves away, I could go UP to (9,5) to eat the apple if it remains.\n\nLEFT to (7,4) seems to lead to fewer options and potentially into a trap near the enemy's body.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT is safer and maintains more future flexibility.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (9,4), assess if (9,5) is occupied by enemy or apple. If enemy is there, avoid head-on and move DOWN to (9,3) to stay alive and circle back. If apple is there and enemy not, consider eating it if safe (check enemy's possible moves). Always keep an escape route along the wall.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples are at (9,9), (1,7), (3,5), (0,9), (1,1).\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (9,2):**\n- **UP to (9,3):** Contains my own body (the segment immediately behind my head). **UNSAFE.**\n- **DOWN to (9,1):** Empty. **SAFE.**\n- **LEFT to (8,2):** Empty. **SAFE.**\n- **RIGHT:** Wall (x=10). Off the board. **UNSAFE.**\n\nSafe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy's possible moves from (9,7):**\nEnemy can move UP to (9,8) (empty), DOWN to (9,6) (its own body), LEFT to (8,7) (empty), RIGHT is wall. Its safe moves are UP and LEFT. It is likely to move UP toward the apple at (9,9) or LEFT toward the center. It cannot reach my immediate safe cells (9,1) or (8,2) this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Strategic evaluation and future plan:**\nBoth DOWN and LEFT are safe. My long-term plan from last turn was to start moving left toward the apples on the left side (1,1), (3,5), (1,7). Moving LEFT to (8,2) directly progresses that plan and opens more options next turn (from (8,2) I could go UP, DOWN, or further LEFT). Moving DOWN to (9,1) keeps me pinned against the right wall, limiting future moves (only UP and LEFT from (9,1) next turn, but UP would be into (9,2) which will be my tail if I move? Wait: If I move DOWN to (9,1) and don't eat, my tail (8,4) will be removed, so my new body will be: head (9,1), then (9,3), (9,4). So from (9,1), UP to (9,2) will be empty, LEFT to (8,1) empty, DOWN to (9,0) empty. That's actually three options. However, moving LEFT now gets me away from the wall and closer to apples sooner.\n\nI should also consider apple proximity: The closest apple is (1,1), which is 7 steps away horizontally if I move left along y=2 or y=1. Moving LEFT now reduces that distance. The apple at (9,9) is far and enemy is likely heading there; I should avoid competing directly unless safe.\n\n**Step 4: Avoid potential future traps:**\nIf I move LEFT to (8,2), next turn my head will be at (8,2) with body [(9,2), (9,3), (9,4)]? Let's simulate: After moving head to (8,2) and not eating, the tail (8,4) is removed, so body becomes: (9,2) (old head), (9,3), (9,4). So from (8,2), my possible moves next turn: UP to (8,3) empty, DOWN to (8,1) empty, LEFT to (7,2) empty, RIGHT to (9,2) contains my body (old head) \u2013 unsafe. So three safe moves. That's good.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9,1), body becomes: (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). From (9,1), moves: UP to (9,2) empty, DOWN to (9,0) empty, LEFT to (8,1) empty, RIGHT wall. Also three safe moves. But LEFT is more progressive.\n\nGiven the plan to move left, I choose LEFT.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** Continue moving left along y=2 or adjust downward toward apple at (1,1). Monitor enemy's position; if it goes for (9,9), I have time to collect left-side apples. Avoid moving into the enemy's potential path; keep distance.\n\nLEFT",
