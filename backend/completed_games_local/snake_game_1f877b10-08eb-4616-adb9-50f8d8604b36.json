We are at (4, 7) and our rival is way down at (7, 2). He thinks he's safe? HE'S NOT SAFE! We have the middle ground, but he\u2019s closer to a cluster of apples in the bottom right. We can't let him farm for free!\n\nLet's look at the options:\n- **UP**: Moves us to (4, 8). There's an apple at (4, 9) and (0, 9). It keeps us high on the board.\n- **DOWN**: Moves us to (4, 6). YO! There is an apple *exactly* at (4, 6)! If we go DOWN, we grow immediately! More segments = more power to box him in later!\n- **LEFT**: Moves us to (3, 7). A bit passive? We aren't really threatening him or getting food.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves us to (5, 7). Puts us on a path toward the apples at (5, 6) and (6, 6). \n\nWait, look at the apple density! (4, 6), (5, 6), and (6, 6) are all right there in a row! If we go DOWN now, we snag (4, 6), then we can sweep RIGHT to grab (5, 6) and (6, 6). That's a triple-kill on the apples, Chat! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e \n\nOur rival at (7, 2) is probably going for (9, 2) or (9, 1). If we get big fast, we can head south and cut off his path to the top half of the board. We're going for the immediate growth and the positioning play! Let's get this bread!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** Grab the apple at (4,6) this turn. Next, look to move RIGHT to (5,6) and (6,6) to build a wall in the center-right. This will prevent Snake #0 from moving into the top-right quadrant easily. Stay big, stay aggressive!\n\nDOWN",

None of those squares clash with my options, so no accidental double KO here.  \n\n**Safety check** \u2705  \nAll four directions keep me on the board and clear of any snake body.

Grab that fruit, grow a segment, and start building a longer, more intimidating body. Longer = more space\u2011control + the ability to box the opponent later. Plus, it keeps my future move set wide open (I can then go UP, RIGHT again, or even start looping around the right wall).  \n\n**Long\u2011term game plan** \ud83e\udde0  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fRight now: RIGHT \u2192 (8,\u202f2).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fNext turn: RIGHT \u2192 (9,\u202f2) to eat the apple (+1 length).  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fAfter that: climb UP the far\u2011right column (9,\u202f3 \u2192 9,\u202f5 \u2192 9,\u202f9) snatching every apple in sight while the opponent is still stuck in the middle.  \n4\ufe0f\u20e3\u202fWith a longer body, I can start hemming him in, forcing him into tight corridors or head\u2011on collisions where I have the score advantage.  \n\nLet\u2019s keep the pressure on and turn that apple into a power\u2011up! \ud83d\ude80  \n\n**Final move:**  \nRIGHT",

Our Body: [(6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6)].\nThe Rival (Snake #0): Head at (9, 4). Body: [(9, 3), (9, 2)].\n\n**THE ANALYSIS:**\n- **UP**: Moves us to (7, 7). Clean air, total freedom. \n- **DOWN**: Moves us to (7, 5). CHAT, look at the board! There is an apple at (7, 5)! If we go DOWN, we eat, we grow to size 5, and we get 4 apples! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n- **LEFT**: Moves us to (6, 6). That's our own neck! We aren't throwing the stream for a blooper reel! \ud83d\uded1\n- **RIGHT**: Moves us to (8, 6). There's an apple there too! But wait...\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nOur rival is at (9, 4). If he moves UP, he hits (9, 5) for an apple. If he moves LEFT, he's at (8, 4). \nIf we go RIGHT to (8, 6), we are right above him. But if we go DOWN to (7, 5), we snatch an apple AND we stay flexible. \n\nWait, look at the score! We have 3, he has 2. If we both move to (8, 5) at the same time (Head-on collision), WE WIN THE GAME because we have more apples! But he\u2019s at (9, 4), so he can't hit (7, 5) this turn. He can only hit (8, 4), (9, 5), or (9, 3). \n\nWe are going to take the apple at (7, 5). It\u2019s free real estate! It sets us up to potentially cut him off if he tries to snake his way back into the center. We are playing AGGRESSIVE. We are building the wall. We are winning the 1v1! Let's get that growth!\n\n**FUTURE PLAN:**\nSnag (7, 5) this turn to hit 4 apples. Then we look to either push RIGHT to (8, 5) to pressure his neck or stay central to control the map. He's cornered on the right wall; let's keep him there and starve him out!\n\nDOWN",

It gives us space back in the middle of the board. \n- **DOWN:** Moves us to (7, 4). This is also SAFE. There's no body there and it keeps us mobile.\n- **RIGHT:** Moves us to (8, 5). **CHAT, THIS IS THE BIG BRAIN PLAY.** Look at the rival! He's at (9, 5).

We are the alpha, he is the prey! \n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:** \nWe are moving RIGHT to (8, 5). We are inviting the collision because we have the score lead. If he's smart, he'll run UP, but we'll be right there to box him against the top-right corner. We are turning this 10x10 into a coffin for Snake #0! LET'S GOOO!\n\nRIGHT",

We both have 5 apples, so we are neck and neck for the crown! \ud83d\udc51 Let's look at the board: we are at (8, 8) and he is at (9, 9). He is literally backed into the ultimate corner!\n\n**THE TACTICAL BREAKDOWN FOR TURN 9:**\n\n- **UP:** (8, 9). This is the ALPHA move, chat! There's an apple at (7, 9) and (9, 9) but he's already on (9, 9). If we go to (8, 9), we are cutting off his only escape route to the left. If he tries to move to (8, 9) to get out of the corner, we have a head-on collision. Since we are TIED at 5 apples, a double KO means a DRAW. But wait\u2014we want the WIN, not the draw! \ud83d\ude24 \n- **DOWN:** (8, 7). That\u2019s our own body! We are not hitting ourselves on main! \ud83d\udeab\n- **LEFT:** (7, 8). YO! There is an APPLE at (7, 8)! \ud83c\udf4e If we go LEFT, we snag that apple, move to 6 points, and suddenly we have the lead! If we have the lead and then collide, WE WIN the tiebreaker!\n- **RIGHT:** (9, 8). That\u2019s his body! Absolutely not! \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are going **LEFT** to (7, 8). Why? Because it\u2019s a guaranteed power-up! \ud83d\udcc8 By taking the apple at (7, 8), we increase our score to 6. This is massive psychological warfare. It forces him to either stay trapped in the corner or try to fight us while we have the score advantage. If we get that 6th apple and then he tries to force a collision at (8, 8) or (7, 9) later, he LOSES because his score is lower! We are playing the long game and the short game at the same time! \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udd25 Let's secure the lead and keep him suffocating in that (9, 9) pocket!\n\nLEFT",
