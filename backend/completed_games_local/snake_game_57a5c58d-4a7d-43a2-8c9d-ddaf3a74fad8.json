Not urgent.  \n- RIGHT (9, 2): closer to apple (9, 0) (2 steps down next turn).  \n\nApple (9, 0) is 2 steps away if I go RIGHT then DOWN.  \nApple (0, 2) is far left.\n\n---\n\n**Future mobility check:**  \nFrom (8, 1): moves possible except UP into body? Wait, my body will be at (8, 2) after move DOWN, so UP from (8, 1) goes to (8, 2) which is my previous head position, now body \u2014 that's safe as long as not moving backwards into neck? Let's check:  \nIf I go DOWN now, next turn my head is (8, 1), body = [(8, 2), (8, 3)] in that order. Then UP from (8, 1) \u2192 (8, 2) which is my own body segment (the neck) \u2192 death. So indeed, going DOWN now eliminates UP as a safe move next turn. That's bad \u2014 reduces options.\n\nFrom (7, 2): body at (8, 2) and (8, 3). Next turn, possible moves from (7, 2): UP (7, 3) empty, DOWN (7, 1) empty, LEFT (6, 2) empty, RIGHT (8, 2) my body \u2192 not safe. So 3 options.\n\nFrom (9, 2): body at (8, 2) and (8, 3). Next turn, possible moves from (9, 2): UP (9, 3) empty, DOWN (9, 1) empty, LEFT (8, 2) my body \u2192 not safe, RIGHT off board \u2192 not safe. So only 2 options (UP, DOWN). That's worse.\n\nBest mobility: LEFT \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \nDOWN \u2192 only 2 safe moves next turn (LEFT, RIGHT; UP into neck, DOWN possible unless at edge). Actually from (8, 1): safe moves: LEFT (7, 1), RIGHT (9, 1), DOWN (8, 0) \u2014 that\u2019s 3, not 2. Wait, let\u2019s check:  \nFrom (8, 1):  \nUP (8, 2) = body \u2192 no.  \nDOWN (8, 0) = empty \u2192 yes.  \nLEFT (7, 1) = empty \u2192 yes.  \nRIGHT (9, 1) = empty \u2192 yes.  \nSo 3 options. Actually same as LEFT. So DOWN and LEFT both give 3 next options. RIGHT gives only 2.\n\nSo LEFT or DOWN better than RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Apple strategy:**  \nClosest apple to me is (9, 0) or (0, 2).  \n(9, 0): path: RIGHT then DOWN then DOWN? Actually RIGHT (9, 2) \u2192 DOWN (9, 1) \u2192 DOWN (9, 0). But RIGHT now reduces future options.  \n(0, 2): path: LEFT 8 steps \u2014 too far.\n\nBetter to go LEFT now, stay flexible, maybe aim for center apples later.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nLEFT now to (7, 2). This opens path to (5, 8) eventually, avoids trapping myself on right edge, keeps distance from enemy.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT\n\nLEFT",

No, board shows T at (3,3) but that\u2019s far away). Actually board row 3: T at (3,3), so (6,3) is empty. No enemy body there. Safe.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6,1) \u2013 Empty. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,2) \u2013 Empty. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,2) \u2013 That\u2019s my own body segment (tail). Moving RIGHT would hit myself \u2192 deadly.  \n\nSo RIGHT is eliminated.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy snake\u2019s possible moves:**  \nEnemy head at (1,2), body at (1,3).  \nEnemy\u2019s safe moves:  \n- UP from (1,2) \u2192 (1,3) is its own body \u2192 deadly.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1,1) empty. Safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0,2) has an apple. Safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,2) empty. Safe.  \n\nSo enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (2,2), no conflict with me.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (0,2), no conflict.  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (1,1), no conflict.  \n\nNo head-on collision possible with me this turn because I\u2019m at (6,2) and enemy is at (1,2).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Consider apple proximity and future mobility:**  \n\nClosest apples to me:  \n- (0,2) \u2013 far left, but enemy might go there.  \n- (9,0) \u2013 far bottom right.  \n- (5,8) \u2013 up-left far.  \n- (7,9) \u2013 up-right far.  \n- (9,9) \u2013 top right far.  \n\nActually, looking at board: Apple at (0,2) is in row 2, col 0. Apple at (9,0) row 0 col 9.  \nFrom my position (6,2):  \n- Apple at (0,2) is 6 left (same row).  \n- Apple at (9,0) is 3 right, 2 down.  \n- Apple at (5,8) is 1 left, 6 up.  \n- Apple at (7,9) is 1 right, 7 up.  \n- Apple at (9,9) is 3 right, 7 up.  \n\nApple at (5,8) is closest in Manhattan distance? Let\u2019s check:  \n(0,2): |6-0|+|2-2| = 6  \n(9,0): |6-9|+|2-0| = 3+2=5  \n(5,8): |6-5|+|2-8| = 1+6=7  \n(7,9): |6-7|+|2-9| = 1+7=8  \n(9,9): |6-9|+|2-9| = 3+7=10  \n\nClosest is (9,0) distance 5, then (0,2) distance 6, then (5,8) distance 7.  \n\nTo get toward (9,0), I\u2019d want to go RIGHT (dead) or DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Evaluate my safe moves:**  \n\nUP (6,3): Opens future moves except maybe if I later go right into my own tail? But tail will move if I don\u2019t eat apple. Currently tail at (7,2). If I move UP, tail stays at (7,2) until next move when it moves to (6,2)? Wait, if I move UP to (6,3), my body becomes [(6,3), (7,2)]? Actually snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves to previous position of segment ahead. So tail at (7,2) moves to old head position (6,2). So after UP, body: [(6,3), (6,2)]. That means (7,2) becomes empty.  \n\nSo next turn from (6,3), possible moves:  \nUP (6,4), DOWN (6,2) \u2013 that\u2019s my own body segment then (tail moved to (6,2)), so DOWN deadly next turn. LEFT (5,3), RIGHT (7,3). So 3 safe moves next turn if UP now.  \n\nDOWN (6,1): Toward apple (9,0)? Actually (9,0) is right-down, so DOWN then later RIGHT. From (6,1), next turn: UP back to (6,2) (empty then? No, (6,2) will be my body segment after this move if I go DOWN). Let\u2019s simulate: If I go DOWN to (6,1), body becomes [(6,1), (7,2)]? Wait careful: Head to (6,1), then segment 1 (old (7,2)) moves to old head (6,2). So new body: [(6,1), (6,2)]. So next turn from (6,1), UP to (6,2) is my body \u2192 deadly. DOWN to (6,0) safe, LEFT (5,1) safe, RIGHT (7,1) safe. So 3 safe moves next turn if DOWN now.  \n\nLEFT (5,2): Toward apple (5,8) straight up later, or apple (0,2) left. From (5,2), body becomes [(5,2), (6,2)] after move. Next turn from (5,2): UP (5,3) safe, DOWN (5,1) safe, LEFT (4,2) safe, RIGHT (6,2) my body \u2192 deadly. So 3 safe moves next turn if LEFT now.  \n\nAll three safe moves now give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Choose based on apple proximity:**  \n\n(9,0) is closest (distance 5). To eventually reach (9,0), going DOWN now is better than LEFT or UP.  \nAlso, going DOWN avoids enemy entirely (enemy far left).  \nGoing DOWN to (6,1) then possibly RIGHT toward column 9.  \n\nAlso, board shows bottom row has apple at (9,0), so moving down gets me closer to bottom row where I can traverse right.  \n\nUP and LEFT move me away from (9,0).  \n\nSo **DOWN** seems best.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Quick long-term plan note:**  \nTry to snake toward (9,0) while keeping options open. Avoid trapping myself in corners. Enemy is far left currently, so right side is safer.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nDOWN",

None of my possible moves (5,3), (4,2), (6,2) are enemy body.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Consider enemy head movement possibilities**  \nEnemy head at (0, 2).  \nEnemy possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 3)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 1) \u2014 its own body, illegal  \n- LEFT \u2192 (-1, 2) \u2014 off board, illegal  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 2)  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe moves: UP or RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Avoid head-on collisions**  \nEnemy could go RIGHT to (1, 2).  \nMy possible moves:  \n- UP (5, 3): not adjacent to (1, 2), no conflict possible.  \n- LEFT (4, 2): not adjacent to (1, 2), no conflict.  \n- RIGHT (6, 2): not adjacent to (1, 2), no conflict.  \n\nSo no immediate head-on risk this turn because we are far apart.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Apple proximity and future options**  \nApples: (5,8) far north, (2,7) north-west, others far east.  \n\nFrom (5,2):  \n- UP (5,3): moves toward (5,8) and (2,7), opens up more central area.  \n- LEFT (4,2): moves toward (2,7) but less directly.  \n- RIGHT (6,2): moves away from most apples except maybe (7,9) later but very far.  \n\nAlso check safe follow-up moves after each:  \n\nAfter UP to (5,3):  \nNext from (5,3): possible moves UP (5,4), LEFT (4,3), RIGHT (6,3), DOWN (5,2) \u2014 all 4 safe unless enemy moves into them next turn, but currently safe.  \n\nAfter LEFT to (4,2):  \nNext from (4,2): UP (4,3), LEFT (3,2), RIGHT (5,2) \u2014 DOWN (4,1) is safe too. 4 options.  \n\nAfter RIGHT to (6,2):  \nNext from (6,2): UP (6,3), LEFT (5,2), RIGHT (7,2), DOWN (6,1) \u2014 all 4 options.  \n\nAll three moves give 4 possible follow-ups now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Strategic considerations**  \nEnemy is at (0,2) with 2 apples, longer body. They might go for apple at (2,7) eventually, but right now they can only go UP or RIGHT. If they go RIGHT to (1,2), they\u2019re closer to (2,7) next turn.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (4,2), I\u2019m closer to (2,7) but might meet enemy later near there.  \n\nBetter to go UP toward (5,8) which is far from enemy\u2019s path, less contested.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Long-term plan note**  \nTarget apple (5,8) or (7,9), avoid west side where enemy is heading. Keep space for growth, stay central for flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP  \n\nUP",

Yes (y=5 within 0\u20139).  \n   - Into own body? No, body is at (5,3).  \n   - Into enemy body? Enemy body cells: (1,2), (0,2). Not at (5,5).  \n   - Enemy head moving into same cell? Enemy head currently at (2,2). Possible moves for enemy: UP\u2192(2,3), DOWN\u2192(2,1), LEFT\u2192(1,2) (into its own body \u2192 invalid), RIGHT\u2192(3,2). So enemy cannot reach (5,5) in one move.  \n   - Safe? Yes.\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (5, 3)  \n   - Inside board? Yes (y=3 within 0\u20139).  \n   - Into own body? Yes, body segment at (5,3). This would kill me.  \n   - Eliminate.\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (4, 4)  \n   - Inside board? Yes.  \n   - Into own body? No.  \n   - Into enemy body? No.  \n   - Enemy head moving into same cell? Enemy from (2,2) to (4,4) impossible in one move.  \n   - Safe? Yes.\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 4)  \n   - Inside board? Yes.  \n   - Into own body? No.  \n   - Into enemy body? No.  \n   - Enemy head moving into same cell? Impossible for enemy in one move.  \n   - Safe? Yes.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Evaluate safety considering enemy movement:**\n\nEnemy head at (2,2), body at (1,2),(0,2).  \nPossible enemy moves:  \n- UP to (2,3): safe for them (empty cell).  \n- DOWN to (2,1): safe (empty).  \n- LEFT to (1,2): into own body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT to (3,2): safe (empty).  \n\nEnemy likely to avoid death, could go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.  \n\nNo head-on collision possible with me unless I move to (2,3), (2,1), or (3,2), which I\u2019m not.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Consider apples and future options:**\n\nApples:  \n- (5,8): far above.  \n- (2,7): far above-left.  \n- (9,0): far bottom-right.  \n- (7,9): far top-right.  \n- (9,9): far top-right.  \n\nClosest apple: (5,8) is 4 steps up from my head (5,4).  \nClosest by Manhattan distance:  \n(5,8): dist 4  \n(2,7): dist |5-2|+|4-7|=3+3=6  \n(7,9): dist 7  \n(9,9): dist 9  \n(9,0): dist 10  \n\nSo (5,8) is closest.\n\n**UP** moves toward (5,8) directly.  \nLEFT moves away from (5,8).  \nRIGHT moves away from (5,8) unless planning a detour later.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**\n\nFrom (5,5) after UP:  \nNeighbors: (5,6), (5,4), (4,5), (6,5).  \n(5,4) is my old head (now body at (5,4)? Wait, no: my body currently is [(5,3)]. After moving UP to (5,5), body becomes [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]? No, that\u2019s wrong: I only grow if I eat an apple. I haven\u2019t eaten apple this turn, so length stays 2. After move UP: head to (5,5), tail (5,3) disappears, body is [(5,5), (5,4)]. So (5,4) will be my body next turn, so from (5,5) I cannot move DOWN into (5,4).  \n\nFrom (5,5): allowed moves next turn: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is into own body). So 3 options.\n\nFrom (4,4) after LEFT:  \nNeighbors: (4,5), (4,3), (3,4), (5,4).  \n(5,4) will be empty (tail left it), (4,3) empty, (3,4) empty, (4,5) empty. All 4 directions possible next turn. So 4 options.\n\nFrom (6,4) after RIGHT:  \nNeighbors: (6,5), (6,3), (5,4), (7,4).  \n(5,4) empty, others empty. All 4 directions possible next turn. So 4 options.\n\nSo UP gives fewer next-move options (3) than LEFT or RIGHT (4).\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Danger from enemy:**  \nEnemy at (2,2) could go UP toward apple (2,7) eventually, but not immediate threat to me. No direct interaction likely.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term strategy note for next turn:**  \nGoing UP now gets me closer to apple (5,8), but reduces mobility slightly next turn. But since I\u2019m short (length 2), I have space. I should try to eat apples to grow while avoiding dead ends. (5,8) is only 3 steps up from (5,5), so maybe next turn move toward it again.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP is safe, moves toward nearest apple, and though it reduces next-turn options by 1, it\u2019s still acceptable because I\u2019ll have 3 moves next turn, not a dead end.\n\n---\n\n**Final move:**\n\nUP",

Maintain flexibility to avoid potential dead ends.\n\nUP",

We have collected 2 apples.\n- The enemy snake (ID 0) is at (5, 6) with a body segment at (5, 5). It has collected 1 apple.\n\n**Available Safe Moves:**\nLet's evaluate all the possible moves from our current position:\n- **UP**: Moves to (3, 4) (safe)\n- **DOWN**: Moves to (3, 2) (safe)\n- **LEFT**: Moves to (2, 3) (safe)\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to (4, 3) (safe)\n\n**Apples on the Board:**\n- (9, 0), (5, 8), (7, 9), (9, 9), (2, 7)\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n1. **Avoiding Conflict**: We need to avoid potential head-on collisions with the enemy snake. Moving **UP** or **RIGHT** keeps us further away from Snake #0, reducing the risk of a direct collision.\n2. **Access to Apples**: Moving **UP** or **RIGHT** positions us closer to potential future apple paths. Although there's no apple directly in those directions, it opens up future possibilities.\n3. **Keeping Options Open**: Moving **RIGHT** allows us to explore a new path, keeping more options open for future turns. Moving **UP** also keeps options open but might restrict future movement if the enemy snake decides to move upwards.\n\n**Plan for the Next Few Turns:**\n1. **Turn 11**: Move RIGHT to (4, 3). This move keeps us safe and opens up new strategic paths.\n2. **Turn 12**: Evaluate the board to decide between moving towards (5, 8) or exploring other options.\n3. **Turn 13**: Continue to plan a route that maximizes safety and apple-collecting opportunities.\n\n**Final Move Decision:**\nAfter considering all factors, moving **RIGHT** is the most strategic choice for the current turn.

Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (3,4)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,2)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,3) (enemy body at (2,3) \u2192 would die, so unlikely unless they make a mistake)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,3)  \n\nFrom my position (5,6), enemy at (3,3) is not adjacent to any of my possible moves except maybe if they move RIGHT to (4,3) and I move LEFT to (4,6) \u2014 no collision, different cells.  \nIf enemy moves UP to (3,4) and I move LEFT to (4,6), still safe.  \n\nNo risk of head-on collision this turn because enemy is too far.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and future mobility:**  \n\nClosest apple: (5,8) is 2 cells away if I go UP.  \n(5,8) is directly above me.  \n\nIf I go UP to (5,7):  \n- Next turn, I can go UP to (5,8) to eat apple (unless enemy interferes, but enemy is far).  \n- From (5,7), safe moves next turn likely: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN into my tail at (5,6) might be safe if tail moves).  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (4,6):  \n- Apple (5,8) is now distance 4.  \n- But I'm closer to apple (2,7) maybe? Actually (2,7) is 2 units left, 1 up from (4,6) \u2192 Manhattan distance 3.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,6):  \n- Apple (7,9) is 3 units right, 3 up \u2192 distance 6.  \n- Apple (5,8) is distance 3.  \n\nSo **UP** is best for apple (5,8).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future options:**  \n\nFrom (5,7) after moving UP:  \n- Tail is at (5,5) now, but after my move, body will be [(5,7), (5,6)] (tail at (5,6)).  \n- Next turn, possible moves from (5,7):  \n  - UP to (5,8) apple.  \n  - LEFT to (4,7) safe unless enemy moves there (enemy far).  \n  - RIGHT to (6,7) safe.  \n  - DOWN to (5,6) is my own body (tail) \u2192 would die unless tail moves away. Tail will be at (5,6) next turn, so DOWN is unsafe next turn.  \n\nSo from (5,7), I'll have 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) next turn.  \n\nFrom (4,6) after moving LEFT:  \n- Tail at (5,6) next turn.  \n- From (4,6): UP (4,7), LEFT (3,6), RIGHT (5,6) body, DOWN (4,5).  \n- So 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, DOWN).  \n\nFrom (6,6) after moving RIGHT:  \n- UP (6,7), RIGHT (7,6), DOWN (6,5), LEFT (5,6) body.  \n- So 3 safe moves.  \n\nAll safe moves give 3 options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \n\nUP gets me to apple (5,8) in 2 moves.  \nWatch enemy movement; they may head toward (2,7) apple.  \nAfter eating (5,8), consider path to (7,9) or (9,9).  \nAvoid trapping myself in top row later.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP  \n\nUP",

Let\u2019s check enemy possible moves from (4, 5):  \n    - Enemy UP \u2192 (4, 6)  \n    - Enemy DOWN \u2192 (4, 4) (own body) \u2192 invalid  \n    - Enemy LEFT \u2192 (3, 5)  \n    - Enemy RIGHT \u2192 (5, 5)  \n  So enemy cannot reach (6, 9) in one move. So UP safe from immediate head-on collision.  \n\n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 7):  \n  - That\u2019s an apple cell. Eating apple is good.  \n  - Check collisions: not in my body [(5, 8), (5, 7)] \u2192 but wait, (6, 7) is apple, but my body is at (5, 7) which is adjacent, not same cell. So safe.  \n  - Not in enemy body [(4, 4), (4, 3)].  \n  - Enemy head at (4, 5) \u2192 can enemy reach (6, 7) in one move? No, too far. So DOWN safe.  \n\n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 8):  \n  - That\u2019s my own body (second segment) \u2192 would die. So LEFT invalid.  \n\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 8):  \n  - Within board, not in my body, not in enemy body.  \n  - Enemy can\u2019t reach (7, 8) in one move. So RIGHT safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n**Evaluation:**  \n- DOWN \u2192 eat apple at (6, 7) \u2192 grow by 1, score increases to 3 apples.  \n- After eating, my new head at (6, 7), new body: old head (6, 8) becomes segment 1, (5, 8) segment 2, (5, 7) segment 3 (tail).  \n- Risk: enemy is at (4, 5), not an immediate threat.  \n\nUP \u2192 (6, 9) \u2192 no apple, closer to apples (7, 9) and (9, 9) but also top edge limits future moves slightly.  \n\nRIGHT \u2192 (7, 8) \u2192 no apple, positions near (7, 9) apple next turn if I go UP afterward.  \n\n**Which is best?**  \nEating apple now is good for score, but must check future safety after eating. If I go DOWN to (6, 7), next turn my head is at (6, 7), body: (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7). Possible moves from (6, 7):  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 8) my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 6) safe unless enemy there.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 7) my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 7) safe.  \nSo after eating, I\u2019d only have DOWN and RIGHT available. That\u2019s risky \u2014 could get trapped if enemy approaches.  \n\nBetter to keep more options open. UP from now gives me (6, 9), then next turn from (6, 9): possible moves: DOWN (back to (6, 8) which will be body if I don\u2019t eat), LEFT (5, 9), RIGHT (7, 9) apple. But if I go UP now without eating, my body stays same length, tail at (5, 7) will move next turn when I move head? Wait \u2014 no, tail moves only when I don\u2019t eat apple. So if I move UP (no apple eaten), my tail (5, 7) will move forward? Actually, in Snake, if no apple eaten, tail moves: head to (6, 9), body becomes [(6, 8), (5, 8)], tail (5, 7) disappears. So new body: head (6, 9), body [(6, 8), (5, 8)].  \n\nFrom (6, 9), possible moves next turn: DOWN (back to (6, 8) body \u2014 invalid), LEFT (5, 9), RIGHT (7, 9) apple. So only LEFT and RIGHT available from top row \u2014 also limited.  \n\nRIGHT from now: (7, 8), body becomes [(6, 8), (5, 8)], tail gone. From (7, 8), possible moves next turn: UP (7, 9) apple, DOWN (7, 7), LEFT (6, 8) body \u2014 invalid, RIGHT (8, 8). So 3 options (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). That\u2019s better.  \n\nActually, RIGHT seems best for keeping options open and being near apple (7, 9).  \n\n**Check enemy threat:** Enemy at (4, 5) could go to (5, 5), (3, 5), (4, 6). None threaten (7, 8) immediately.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nGo RIGHT now to (7, 8), then next turn likely UP to eat (7, 9) apple, then move toward (9, 9) while avoiding top-edge trap. Keep an eye on enemy movement \u2014 they\u2019re far left currently.  \n\n**Final choice:** RIGHT  \n\nRIGHT",

Then from (9, 9) only DOWN (9, 8) body \u2192 invalid, LEFT (8, 9) possible. So after eating (9, 9), I\u2019d be trapped at top-right corner with only LEFT move. That\u2019s risky if enemy approaches later.  \nBut if I go UP now to (8, 9), then LEFT to (7, 9) apple next turn, after eating I\u2019d be at (7, 9) with body: [(7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8)]? Wait, careful:  \nCurrent body: head (8, 8), body [(7, 8), (6, 8)]. If I move UP to (8, 9), no apple eaten, body becomes [(8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8)], tail (6, 8) gone.

From (7, 9) next moves: DOWN (7, 8) body \u2192 invalid, LEFT (6, 9), RIGHT (8, 9) body \u2192 invalid, only LEFT possible \u2192 also trapped.  \n\nSo both (9, 9) and (7, 9) eating next turn lead to being trapped with only one exit.\n\nMaybe better to avoid eating immediately if it traps me. Instead, go DOWN to (8, 7) to keep more options and aim for (6, 7) apple later while avoiding enemy.\n\n**Check enemy path to (6, 7):**\nEnemy at (2, 5) \u2192 (6, 7) is 4 moves away at least (Manhattan distance 6). I can reach (6, 7) in 2 moves from (8, 7): DOWN to (8, 6) then LEFT to (7, 6)? Wait, (6, 7) is at x=6, y=7. From (8, 7) to (6, 7) is LEFT twice. But (7, 7) is empty. So: (8, 7) \u2192 (7, 7) \u2192 (6, 7) apple. That\u2019s 2 turns. Enemy would take at least 3 turns to reach (6, 7) from (2, 5) if it goes directly. So I could beat it there.\n\nBut enemy might also go for (2, 7) apple first.\n\nGiven scores tied at 2 apples each, getting an apple soon is good but staying alive is more important.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT seems okay for moving toward (9, 9), but after eating it, trapped.  \nUP also leads to trap after eating.  \nDOWN gives more flexibility.\n\nLet's choose DOWN to keep options open and move toward center.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (8, 7), consider LEFT toward (6, 7) apple if enemy not too close, or DOWN/right to avoid dead ends.\n\nDOWN",

Check enemy positions then.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

That\u2019s a future risk but not immediate.\n\nIf I move UP to (6,8), enemy could move UP to (3,8) \u2014 not close.  \nIf I move DOWN to (6,6), enemy could move DOWN to (3,6) \u2014 not close.\n\nImmediate head-on collision this turn?  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (4,7) and I move LEFT to (5,7), we don\u2019t collide this turn.  \nIf enemy moves UP to (3,8) and I move UP to (6,8), no collision.  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (3,6) and I move DOWN to (6,6), no collision.  \nSo no immediate same-cell collision possible this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Future mobility after each move:**  \n\n- UP to (6,8):  \n  Next turn from (6,8): possible moves?  \n  Check: UP to (6,9) \u2013 empty; DOWN to (6,7) \u2013 empty then but my old head position? Wait, my body will be [(6,8),(6,7),(7,7),(8,7)]? Let\u2019s trace: current body: head (6,7), then (7,7),(8,7),(8,8). After moving UP, new head (6,8), new body: [(6,8),(6,7),(7,7),(8,7)], tail (8,8) disappears (since no apple eaten). So (6,7) is now my neck, so DOWN from (6,8) would go to (6,7) which is my own body \u2192 suicide. So DOWN not safe next turn if I go UP now.  \n  LEFT from (6,8) \u2192 (5,8) empty; RIGHT from (6,8) \u2192 (7,8) empty.  \n  So from (6,8) next turn, safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 safe moves).  \n\n- DOWN to (6,6):  \n  Next turn from (6,6): body will be [(6,6),(6,7),(7,7),(8,7)], tail (8,8) gone.  \n  UP to (6,7) \u2013 my own neck \u2192 suicide. So UP not safe.  \n  DOWN to (6,5) empty; LEFT to (5,6) empty; RIGHT to (7,6) empty.  \n  So safe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 safe moves).  \n\n- LEFT to (5,7):  \n  Next turn from (5,7): body will be [(5,7),(6,7),(7,7),(8,7)], tail (8,8) gone.  \n  UP to (5,8) empty; DOWN to (5,6) empty; LEFT to (4,7) empty; RIGHT to (6,7) my neck \u2192 suicide.  \n  So safe: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 safe moves).  \n\nAll three safe moves give 3 safe options next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nUP: gets me closer to (5,9) and (7,9) \u2014 actually from (6,8), (5,9) is 2 steps away (LEFT, UP), (7,9) is 2 steps away (RIGHT, UP).  \nLEFT: gets me closer to (5,9) \u2014 2 steps (UP, UP from (5,7)), but away from (7,9).  \nDOWN: gets me away from all apples except maybe (1,3) eventually.\n\nSo UP and LEFT both good for apples, DOWN less so.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy pathing:**  \nEnemy might go for (1,3) apple eventually, or maybe (5,9). If enemy goes UP from (3,7) to (3,8), they\u2019re closer to (5,9) but still 3 steps away. If I go LEFT to (5,7), I might race them to (5,9) with equal steps? Let\u2019s check:  \nEnemy at (3,7) \u2192 (3,8) \u2192 (3,9) \u2192 (4,9) \u2192 (5,9) is 4 steps? Wait: (3,7) to (3,8) (1), (3,8) to (3,9) (2), (3,9) to (4,9) (3), (4,9) to (5,9) (4).  \nMe from (5,7): (5,7) to (5,8) (1), (5,8) to (5,9) (2) \u2014 I\u2019m 2 steps away. So if I go LEFT now, next turn I can get to (5,9) in 2 moves, enemy needs 4 moves. So I win that race easily if I go LEFT now.\n\n---\n\n**Risk if enemy moves RIGHT to (4,7):**  \nThen they are adjacent to my (5,7) next turn if I go LEFT now. Could be dangerous if they then move LEFT into me while I move RIGHT into them next turn (head-on). But I can avoid that by not moving RIGHT next turn (since my neck will be at (6,7), so RIGHT would be suicide anyway). So I\u2019d likely move UP or DOWN from (5,7) next turn to avoid collision.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nIf I go LEFT now to (5,7), next turn I can go UP toward (5,9) and likely eat it before enemy. That gives me apple lead.  \nIf I go UP now to (6,8), I\u2019m also close to apples but maybe slightly farther from (5,9).\n\nGiven scores tied, getting an apple lead is good. LEFT seems slightly better for securing (5,9).\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT\n\nLEFT",

Snake #0 is at (5, 7) with the same score as us. Our next moves should focus on getting closer to the apple at (1, 3) or securing the apple at (9, 9) while making sure to avoid Snake #0. Be cautious of Snake #0's movements, especially if it changes direction unexpectedly.\n\n**Turn 19 Rationale:**\n\nLooking at the board, we have a few safe options: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. DOWN is not an option because it leads into our own body.\n\n- **UP** would move us to (3, 9), which is safe and keeps us on the board. It also aligns us to potentially move left next turn to get closer to the apple at (1, 3).\n- **LEFT** would move us to (2, 8), which is also safe. This move could be a part of a plan to loop back down the board, but it's not immediately advantageous.\n- **RIGHT** would move us to (4, 8), another safe move. This could potentially put us in a position to move up and right towards the apple at (5, 9).\n\nGiven our current position and the apples available, moving **UP** seems like the best option. It keeps all future moves open, avoids direct confrontation with Snake #0, and positions us to potentially target the apple at (1, 3) or (9, 9) in the future.\n\nFinal Move: UP",

Not really\u2014only (1,3) is leftwards but far.  \nGoing DOWN gets me away from all current apples.\n\nSo UP is best for apple proximity.\n\n---\n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n\nUP to (5,8):  \nNext turn body: [(5,8),(5,7),(6,7),(7,7)], tail (8,7) gone.  \nFrom (5,8):  \n- UP to (5,9) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN to (5,7) \u2013 my neck \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT to (4,8) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT to (6,8) \u2013 empty.  \nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 safe moves).\n\nDOWN to (5,6):  \nNext turn body: [(5,6),(5,7),(6,7),(7,7)], tail (8,7) gone.  \nFrom (5,6):  \n- UP to (5,7) \u2013 my neck \u2192 suicide.  \n- DOWN to (5,5) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT to (4,6) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT to (6,6) \u2013 empty.  \nSo safe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 safe moves).\n\nLEFT to (4,7):  \nNext turn body: [(4,7),(5,7),(6,7),(7,7)], tail (8,7) gone.  \nFrom (4,7):  \n- UP to (4,8) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN to (4,6) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT to (3,7) \u2013 empty? Wait, enemy body segment at (3,7) currently, but next turn enemy moves, so (3,7) might become free if enemy moves away and it\u2019s not part of future body? Let\u2019s check: enemy body now: [(3,8),(3,7),(2,7),(2,6)]. If enemy moves UP/RIGHT/LEFT, (3,7) stays occupied because it\u2019s second segment this turn, next turn it becomes first body segment after head moves? Actually: enemy head moves, body shifts: new body will be [(new head), (3,8), (3,7), (2,7)], so (3,7) remains occupied by enemy\u2019s third segment. So (3,7) is enemy body next turn. So moving LEFT to (3,7) next turn would kill me. So LEFT from (4,7) next turn is unsafe.  \n- RIGHT to (5,7) \u2013 my neck \u2192 suicide.  \n\nSo from (4,7) next turn, safe moves: UP, DOWN only (2 safe moves). That\u2019s worse.\n\nThus LEFT now reduces future options.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy at (3,8) could move RIGHT to (4,8). If I go UP to (5,8), we\u2019d be adjacent horizontally. That\u2019s risky next turn if we both move toward each other (head-on). But I can avoid that by not moving LEFT from (5,8) next turn if enemy is at (4,8).  \nIf enemy moves UP to (3,9), less threat.  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (2,8), less threat.\n\nGoing DOWN to (5,6) avoids enemy entirely this turn and next, but moves me away from apples.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nI want to secure (5,9) before enemy does. Enemy is at (3,8), can reach (5,9) in: (3,8)\u2192(3,9)\u2192(4,9)\u2192(5,9) = 3 moves.  \nI can reach (5,9) from (5,7) in 2 moves (UP, UP).  \nIf I go UP now to (5,8), next turn I can go UP to (5,9) and eat it before enemy.  \nIf I go LEFT now to (4,7), I\u2019d need UP, UP, RIGHT? Actually from (4,7) to (5,9) is (4,7)\u2192(4,8)\u2192(5,8)\u2192(5,9) = 3 moves, slower.  \nSo UP now is best for securing (5,9).\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nUP gives me:  \n- Closest path to nearest apple (5,9).  \n- 3 safe moves next turn.  \n- Avoids reducing options like LEFT would.  \n- Some adjacency risk with enemy if enemy moves RIGHT to (4,8), but I can choose UP or RIGHT next turn from (5,8) to avoid head-on if needed.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Next turn from (5,8), if enemy is at (4,8), avoid moving LEFT into (4,8); instead go UP to (5,9) for apple or RIGHT to (6,8) to stay safe.\n\nUP",

Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n\n**UP to (5,9)** \u2014 eat apple \u2192 length becomes 5, new body will be [(5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7)], tail stays (7,7).  \nFrom (5,9) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (5,10) off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,8) \u2014 my own body (second segment) \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,9) \u2014 empty unless enemy moves there now.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,9) \u2014 empty.  \n\nSo next turn safe moves: possibly LEFT and RIGHT only (2 options), but depends on enemy position.  \n\n**LEFT to (4,8)** \u2014 no apple, length stays 4, new body [(4,8), (5,8), (5,7), (6,7)], tail (7,7) gone.  \nFrom (4,8) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (4,9) \u2014 empty unless enemy moves there now.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,7) \u2014 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,8) \u2014 currently enemy\u2019s second segment, but enemy head moves now, so enemy body next turn: [(new head), (3,9), (3,8), (3,7)]? Wait, check: enemy current body [(3,9), (3,8), (3,7), (2,7)]? No \u2014 given: head (3,9), body [(3,8), (3,7), (2,7)]. After enemy moves LEFT or RIGHT:  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (2,9): new body [(2,9), (3,9), (3,8), (3,7)] \u2192 (3,8) still occupied. So moving LEFT from (4,8) to (3,8) next turn would die. So LEFT unsafe next turn.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,8) \u2014 my own body second segment \u2192 suicide.  \n\nSo from (4,8) safe next turn: UP and DOWN only (2 options).  \n\n**RIGHT to (6,8)** \u2014 no apple, length 4, new body [(6,8), (5,8), (5,7), (6,7)], tail (7,7) gone.  \nFrom (6,8) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (6,9) \u2014 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,7) \u2014 my own body segment? Let\u2019s check: new body after move: [(6,8), (5,8), (5,7), (6,7)], so (6,7) is last segment \u2192 moving DOWN to (6,7) is suicide (tail is eaten only after move, but here (6,7) is still part of body next turn\u2019s start before shifting? Wait, careful: after moving RIGHT, next turn my body is [(6,8), (5,8), (5,7), (6,7)], tail is (6,7). If I move DOWN to (6,7) next turn, that\u2019s into my own tail, which is still a body segment \u2192 suicide. So DOWN unsafe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,8) \u2014 my second segment \u2192 suicide.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,8) \u2014 empty.  \n\nSo safe next turn: UP and RIGHT (2 options).  \n\nSo all moves give only 2 safe options next turn if enemy occupies certain cells. But UP gives immediate apple, which is valuable for score and growth.  \n\n---\n\n**7. Risk from enemy next turn:**  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (4,9), and I\u2019m at (5,9), enemy could move DOWN to (4,8) or LEFT to (3,9), not into my cell. If enemy moves LEFT to (2,9), far away. So no direct threat next turn from enemy head if I\u2019m at (5,9).  \n\n---\n\n**8. Decision:**  \nUP gets apple now, improves score to 4 vs enemy\u2019s 3, gives slight length advantage.  \nLEFT/RIGHT don\u2019t get apple, and don\u2019t improve position much.  \nEating apple also opens future paths because after eating, my tail stays same for one more turn (growth adds segment after move, so next turn my body longer but tail doesn\u2019t move yet).  \n\nUP seems best.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5,9) after eating apple, I\u2019ll have only LEFT and RIGHT safe (since DOWN into (5,8) is my neck, UP off board). I must check if enemy at (4,9) or (6,9) threatens head-on then, but that\u2019s manageable.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Possible moves from (5, 9):**  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 10) \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 8) \u2192 my own body segment (second segment) \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 9) \u2192 occupied by enemy head right now? Wait: enemy head is at (4, 9) currently. If I move LEFT to (4, 9), enemy could move away or stay? No \u2014 simultaneous movement: both heads move at same time, so I\u2019d die only if enemy also moves to (4, 9) or if enemy stays there. But enemy staying means head stays at (4, 9), so if I move there, heads collide \u2192 both die. So LEFT is dangerous but not *immediately* suicidal unless enemy stays or also moves there.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo definitely safe moves: only RIGHT.  \nLEFT risky (possible head-on collision or moving into enemy head\u2019s starting cell if enemy moves away).  \nUP and DOWN impossible.  \n\n---\n\n**2. Check enemy\u2019s possible moves from (4, 9):**  \nEnemy head (4, 9) possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 10) off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 8) empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 9) occupied by its own body (its neck) \u2192 suicide.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 9) occupied by my head now \u2192 but simultaneous movement: if enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 9) and I move RIGHT to (6, 9), no collision; if enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 9) and I move LEFT to (4, 9), heads swap? Let\u2019s check later.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe moves: DOWN to (4, 8) or RIGHT to (5, 9).  \n\n---\n\n**3. Head-on collision possibilities:**  \nIf I move LEFT to (4, 9):  \n- Enemy moves DOWN to (4, 8) \u2192 I go to (4, 9) empty (enemy left) \u2192 safe.  \n- Enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 9) \u2192 I go to (4, 9) empty \u2192 safe.  \n- Enemy stays at (4, 9) \u2192 impossible because staying means not moving, but staying would be invalid because it\u2019s not a move option? Actually staying is not allowed; they must choose UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT, but if LEFT is suicide and UP invalid, staying means choosing a direction that puts them back in same cell? Not possible in Snake \u2014 they must move to a new cell. So enemy must move DOWN or RIGHT.  \nSo moving LEFT to (4, 9) is safe because enemy will leave (4, 9).  \n\nWait \u2014 careful: If enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 9), and I move LEFT to (4, 9), we swap positions, no collision. That\u2019s safe.  \n\nSo LEFT is actually safe too.  \n\nThus safe moves for me: LEFT and RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Future mobility:**  \nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 9):  \nNext turn body: [(6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7)], tail (7, 7) gone (since length 5, no growth).  \nFrom (6, 9) next turn:  \n- UP off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 8) empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 9) my own body (second segment) \u2192 suicide.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 9) contains apple, possibly safe.  \nSo next turn only DOWN and RIGHT possible.  \n\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 9):  \nNext turn body: [(4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7)], tail (7, 7) gone.  \nFrom (4, 9) next turn:  \n- UP off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 8) empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 9) currently enemy body segment, but enemy moves now, so next turn enemy body will be [(new head), (4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)] if enemy moved DOWN to (4, 8)? Wait, check: enemy current body: [(4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 7)].  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (4, 8): new body [(4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)], so (3, 9) still occupied. So moving LEFT from (4, 9) to (3, 9) next turn would hit enemy body \u2192 unsafe.  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 9): new body [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)], so (3, 9) still occupied. Same result.  \nSo LEFT unsafe next turn if I\u2019m at (4, 9).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 9) my own second segment \u2192 suicide.  \n\nSo from (4, 9) next turn only DOWN possible.  \n\nSo RIGHT gives 2 safe moves next turn, LEFT gives only 1 safe move next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Apple targeting:**  \nApples visible: (7, 9) is 1 step right from (6, 9) after moving RIGHT? No \u2014 from (5, 9) apple at (7, 9) is 2 steps away via RIGHT then RIGHT again.  \nFrom (4, 9), apple at (7, 9) is 3 steps away.  \n\nMoving RIGHT doesn\u2019t get apple now but sets up for (7, 9) next turn if safe.  \nMoving LEFT gets me away from apples.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Risk from enemy next turn:**  \nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 9), enemy at (4, 9) could move DOWN to (4, 8) or RIGHT to (5, 9). If enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 9), next turn enemy head at (5, 9), body [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)]? Wait that\u2019s wrong: if enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 9), its body: [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)], so my position (6, 9) is safe from direct collision next turn unless enemy moves RIGHT again to (6, 9) but that would be into my head if I\u2019m still there. But I\u2019ll move away.  \n\nActually, enemy moving RIGHT to (5, 9) means next turn enemy head at (5, 9), which is adjacent to my (6, 9) \u2192 could be risky if I stay. But I plan to move DOWN or RIGHT next turn anyway.  \n\n---\n\n**7. Decision:**  \nLEFT leads to fewer options next turn (only DOWN).  \nRIGHT gives more options next turn (DOWN or RIGHT) and positions me closer to apple at (7, 9).  \n\nSo RIGHT is better for mobility and future apple access.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 9), check if (7, 9) apple still there and if moving RIGHT is safe (no enemy there, no body there). Likely yes. Otherwise move DOWN to (6, 8) to open more space. Avoid boxing self in top row.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Check enemy\u2019s possible moves from (4, 8):**  \nEnemy head (4, 8) possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 9) \u2192 its own body (second segment) \u2192 suicide.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 7) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 8) \u2192 its own body (last segment? Wait: body is [(4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)], so (3, 8) is tail end, but if enemy moves LEFT into (3, 8), that\u2019s its own body segment \u2192 suicide unless it grows by eating an apple, but there\u2019s no apple at (3, 8). So suicide.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 8) \u2192 my body segment? My body: [(5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7)], so (5, 8) is my third segment \u2192 moving into my body kills enemy, but doesn\u2019t kill me.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move: DOWN to (4, 7).  \n\n---\n\n**3. Head-on collision risk:**  \nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 9), enemy moves DOWN to (4, 7) \u2192 no collision.  \nIf I move DOWN to (6, 8), enemy moves DOWN to (4, 7) \u2192 no collision.  \n\nSo both moves safe from immediate enemy head collision.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Future mobility:**  \n\n**Option A: RIGHT to (7, 9) \u2192 eat apple \u2192 grow by 1 segment.**  \nNew body after growth: head (7, 9), then old head (6, 9), then (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7), tail stays (6, 7) because growth adds segment at tail? Wait, growth means length increases by 1: current length 5, after eating apple length becomes 6, so tail stays same position (no movement) and new segment added at tail? Actually in Snake, when you eat an apple, you grow by 1 segment next turn: this turn you move head to apple cell, tail doesn\u2019t move, so length increases by 1. So after this turn: body = [(7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7)] length 6.  \nNext turn from (7, 9):  \n- UP \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 8) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 9) \u2192 my own body (second segment) \u2192 suicide.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo next turn safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.  \n\n**Option B: DOWN to (6, 8) \u2192 no apple eaten.**  \nNew body: [(6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7)], tail (6, 7) gone (since no growth).  \nNext turn from (6, 8):  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 9) \u2192 my own body (second segment) \u2192 suicide.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 7) \u2192 empty? Wait: (6, 7) was my tail last turn, but tail moved away? Actually after moving DOWN to (6, 8), my body becomes [(6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7)], so (6, 7) is now empty. So DOWN to (6, 7) is safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 8) \u2192 my own body (last segment? Body: 0:(6, 8), 1:(6, 9), 2:(5, 9), 3:(5, 8), 4:(5, 7), so (5, 8) is index 3 \u2192 suicide).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 8) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo next turn safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.  \n\nBoth options give 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Apple proximity:**  \nRIGHT gets apple (7, 9) immediately, increasing my lead (5 apples vs enemy\u2019s 3).  \nDOWN doesn\u2019t get apple now, but positions for future.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Risk from enemy:**  \nEnemy moving DOWN to (4, 7) is away from me either way. No immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\n**7. Long-term planning:**  \nEating apple now is beneficial:  \n- Increases score lead.  \n- Gets apple off board (one fewer for enemy).  \n- Growth gives slightly more flexibility later (longer body can be riskier for space but also can block enemy).  \n\nBut board is 10\u00d710, top row y=9 is crowded with my body and enemy body. After eating apple at (7, 9), my head is at (7, 9), enemy at (4, 7). Next turn I can go DOWN to (7, 8) or RIGHT to (8, 9). RIGHT to (8, 9) keeps me on top row, which has fewer moves (UP invalid). DOWN opens more space.  \n\nIf I go DOWN now to (6, 8), apple at (7, 9) remains, enemy might get it next turn? Enemy at (4, 7) \u2192 needs 3 moves to reach (7, 9), unlikely soon.  \n\n---\n\n**8. Decision:**  \nBoth moves are safe. Eating apple is good for score and doesn\u2019t trap me.  \n\nRIGHT seems slightly better because:  \n- Immediate apple gain.  \n- Same future mobility count as DOWN.  \n- From (7, 9) next turn, I can go DOWN to (7, 8) to escape top row.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 9), likely move DOWN to (7, 8) to avoid being stuck on top row, unless RIGHT to (8, 9) seems clearly safe and leads toward apple (9, 9).  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",
