Body length 0.\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at `(7, 7)`. Body length 0.\n- **Apples:** `(7, 3)`, `(9, 4)`, `(8, 6)`, `(6, 1)`, `(0, 7)`.\n\n**Move Elimination:**\n1.  **UP:** My head is at `(9, 3)`. Moving UP takes me to `(9, 4)`.\n    - **Status:** Valid coordinate (inside board).\n    - **Content:** `(9, 4)` contains an **Apple**.\n    - **Collision Check:** No other snake bodies are currently at `(9, 4)`.\n    - **Head-on Collision Risk:** I must consider where Snake #0 might move. Snake #0 is at `(7, 7)`. The distance between `(7, 7)` and `(9, 4)` is `|7-9| + |7-4| = 2 + 3 = 5`. Snake #0 would need 5 moves to reach `(9, 4)`, so it cannot reach it on this turn. Therefore, a head-on collision is impossible.\n    - **Result:** **SAFE**. This move eats an apple.\n\n2.  **DOWN:** My head is at `(9, 3)`. Moving DOWN takes me to `(9, 2)`.\n    - **Status:** Valid coordinate.\n    - **Content:** Empty.\n    - **Collision Check:** Safe.\n    - **Result:** **SAFE**.\n\n3.  **LEFT:** My head is at `(9, 3)`. Moving LEFT takes me to `(8, 3)`.\n    - **Status:** Valid coordinate.\n    - **Content:** The board shows `A` at `(8, 3)`? Let me re-read the board row for Y=3: `3 . . . . . . . A . 1`.\n        - Index 0: `.` (X=0)\n        - ...\n        - Index 7: `A` (X=7)\n        - Index 8: `.` (X=8)\n        - Index 9: `1` (X=9)\n    - Correction: The Apple is at `(7, 3)`, not `(8, 3)`.\n    - **Collision Check:** Safe.\n    - **Result:** **SAFE**.\n\n4.  **RIGHT:** My head is at `(9, 3)`. Moving RIGHT takes me to `(10, 3)`.\n    - **Status:** Invalid coordinate (X=10 is outside the 0-9 range).\n    - **Result:** **DEAD**.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n- **Up:** Moves to `(9, 4)`, which is an Apple. This is a \"free\" point. Since I have 0 apples, gaining one immediately is advantageous. The move is safe from immediate collision and head-on threats.\n- **Left:** Moves to `(8, 3)`, which is safe but empty. It positions me closer to the apple at `(7, 3)` (distance becomes 1).\n- **Down:** Moves to `(9, 2)`, safe but empty. Moves away from apples.\n\nEating the apple at `(9, 4)` is the optimal move because:\n1.  It secures a point.\n2.  It is completely safe (no snake bodies there, no head-on collision risk).\n3.  It positions me on the edge (X=9), limiting the directions the enemy can approach from (only from the left side), which helps reduce threats.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at `(9, 4)` to score. From `(9, 4)`, the adjacent apples are `(8, 6)` (distance 3) and potentially `(7, 3)` (distance 2, if I go Down then Left). I will prioritize staying safe on the edge while moving towards the next closest apple.\n\n**Move Choice:** UP.\n\nUP",

Body is empty. I have 1 apple.\n    *   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at `(8, 7)`. Body is empty.\n    *   **Board Constraints:** 10x10 board, coordinates 0-9.\n    *   **Apples:** `(7, 3)`, `(9, 4)`, `(8, 6)`, `(6, 1)`, `(0, 7)`.\n\n2.  **Available Moves Evaluation:**\n    *   **UP:** From `(9, 4)` to `(9, 5)`.\n        *   **Safety:** Valid coordinate. Empty space. No collision with myself or enemy body.\n        *   **Head-on Risk:** Enemy is at `(8, 7)`. Distance is `|9-8| + |5-7| = 1 + 2 = 3`. Enemy is 3 units away, so they cannot reach `(9, 5)` this turn.\n        *   **Strategic Value:** `(9, 5)` is on the edge. It is adjacent to the apple at `(8, 6)` (distance 2).\n    *   **DOWN:** From `(9, 4)` to `(9, 3)`.\n        *   **Safety:** Valid coordinate. Empty space. No collision.\n        *   **Head-on Risk:** Enemy distance is `|9-8| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5`. Safe.\n        *   **Strategic Value:** Moves towards the apple at `(7, 3)` (distance becomes 2).\n    *   **LEFT:** From `(9, 4)` to `(8, 4)`.\n        *   **Safety:** Valid coordinate. Empty space. No collision.\n        *   **Head-on Risk:** Enemy distance is `|8-8| + |4-7| = 0 + 3 = 3`. Safe.\n        *   **Strategic Value:** Moves towards the center.\n    *   **RIGHT:** From `(9, 4)` to `(10, 4)`.\n        *   **Safety:** Invalid coordinate. **DEAD.**\n\n3.  **Comparison of Safe Moves (UP vs DOWN vs LEFT):**\n    *   **LEFT (8,4):** Moves into the open center board. While safe now, moving into the center early often increases the risk of being trapped or blocked by the enemy in later turns. The enemy is currently at `(8,7)`, which is on the same X column as this target, potentially creating a bottleneck.\n    *   **DOWN (9,3):** Moves closer to `(7,3)`. The enemy is currently at `(8,7)`. There is a high probability the enemy wants the apple at `(7, 3)` because it is closer to them (distance 4) than to me (distance 3, if I don't move). If I move DOWN, and the enemy moves DOWN/WEST, we could collide near `(7,3)` next turn.\n    *   **UP (9,5):** Moves to the edge. This naturally limits the directions the enemy can engage me (only from the left/top). It sets up a direct path to the apple at `(8,6)` (Left then Left/Down). The enemy is currently at `(8,7)`, which is right next to that apple. However, by moving UP, I preserve the option to chase `(8,6)` or retreat if the enemy grabs it. Being on the edge is generally safer in Snake games as it reduces attack vectors.\n\n    **Decision:** I will choose **UP**. It is a safe move that positions me on the edge to hunt the nearby apple at `(8,6)`, while minimizing immediate threats from the center.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move UP to (9,5). From there, target the apple at (8,6). Monitor enemy movement towards (7,3).\n\nUP",

If the enemy moves DOWN, we will have a head-on collision (both at `(9, 6)`), resulting in both of us dying. This is a significant risk, but a calculated one.\n    *   **DOWN:** Target `(9, 4)`.\n        *   This is my current tail position.\n        *   **Rule Check:** \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" This move is strictly invalid and will kill me.\n    *   **LEFT:** Target `(8, 5)`.\n        *   This is valid and empty.\n        *   This moves me toward the center and keeps me safe from a potential direct confrontation with the enemy.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Target `(10, 5)`.\n        *   This is off the board. Kills me.\n\n3.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   My previous turn (Turn 1) I moved UP to `(9, 5)`.\n    *   The apple at `(8, 6)` is the closest apple (distance 1).\n    *   If I move **UP**, I risk a head-on collision if the enemy moves DOWN. However, if the enemy moves anywhere else (LEFT, RIGHT, or UP), I survive and gain the apple at `(8, 6)` (assuming it wasn't eaten by the enemy, but they would have to be at `(8, 6)` to eat it, which they can't do in one move from `(9, 7)`).\n    *   If I move **LEFT**, I play it safe but miss the immediate apple.\n    *   The enemy currently has 0 apples. They might be playing defensively. If they move UP to `(9, 8)`, I take the apple at `(8, 6)` safely.\n    *   Taking the apple at `(8, 6)` is a strong priority. The only way to die trying to take it is if the enemy moves DOWN to meet me. I will gamble on the enemy not moving directly into a potential collision square.\n\n    *Final Check:* My current tail is at `(9, 4)`. My head is at `(9, 5)`. Moving UP to `(9, 6)` is not backwards. Moving DOWN to `(9, 4)` is backwards (suicide). Moving LEFT to `(8, 5)` is safe. Moving UP is risky but rewards an apple. I will take the apple.\n\n    (Wait, re-evaluating the backward rule. \"Moving directly backwards into your own body...\". My body is at `(9, 4)`. From `(9, 5)`, DOWN goes to `(9, 4)`. This is indeed moving directly backwards into my body. So DOWN is suicide. UP is valid. LEFT is valid. I prefer UP to get the apple at `(8, 6)`).\n\n    *Re-checking Enemy Position:* Enemy at `(9, 7)`. If enemy moves DOWN to `(9, 6)`, we collide. It's turn 2, low chance of suicide play. I will go for the apple.\n\nLong-term Plan: Target apple at (8, 6). If successful, snake grows to length 3 (head (8,6), body (9,5), tail (9,4)). Monitor enemy at (9,7).\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "**Rationale:**\n\n1) Identify safe moves from current head position (9, 7):\n\n- UP to (9, 8): Safe - no snake bodies or edges.\n- DOWN to (9, 6): Safe - no snake bodies or edges.\n- LEFT to (8, 7): Safe - no snake bodies or edges.\n- RIGHT to (10, 7): Not safe - would move off the board (x > 9).\n\n2) Analyze other snakes' moves:\n\n- Enemy snake #1 at (9, 4) with body at (9, 3). The apple at (9, 4) is not directly adjacent to its head. It will likely move UP to (9, 5) to eat the apple.\n\n3) Evaluate each safe move:\n\n- UP to (9, 8): Moves away from nearest apple (8, 6), but keeps you safe.\n- DOWN to (9, 6): Moves toward apple (8, 6) and is safe.\n- LEFT to (8, 7): Moves toward apple (8, 6) and is safe.\n- RIGHT to (10, 7): Not safe - would move off the board.\n\n4) Choose best move:\n\nDOWN is the best move because:\n- It's safe and doesn't collide with anything.\n- It moves you closer to the nearest apple (8, 6).\n- It positions you optimally for the next move.\n- It avoids potential head-on collision with enemy snake #1 moving UP from (9, 4).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Move DOWN to (9, 6) next turn.\n- If snake #1 moves UP to (9, 5), you can move LEFT to (8, 6) to eat the apple.\n- If snake #1 moves elsewhere, you can still move LEFT to (8, 6) or UP to (9, 7) depending on the situation.\n- Avoid getting trapped on the right edge by keeping at least one open move available.\n\nDOWN",
