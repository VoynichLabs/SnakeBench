          "rationale": "First, I need to analyze the current game state. I am snake 0 with my head at (5, 1). There are no body segments, so I haven't grown yet. The enemy snake 1 is at (7, 1), also with no body. There are 5 apples on the board: (3,9), (8,6), (2,3), (6,8), (3,6). The board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right.\n\nTurn is 0, so we are at the start. I need to make a move that keeps me alive and positions me for future growth. I must consider the enemy's possible moves as well.\n\nMy possible moves from (5,1):\n- UP to (5,2): Check if this is within bounds. Yes, y=2 is within 0-9. Is there any snake body there? Board shows row 2: all dots, so no snake. Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,0): y=0 is within bounds. Row 0: all dots, so no snake. Safe.\n- LEFT to (4,1): x=4 is within bounds. Row 1: ... . . . . 0 . 1 . . so at x=4, it's a dot (empty). Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6,1): x=6 is within bounds. Row 1: ... at x=6, it's a dot? Let's see: positions: x=5 is '0' (me), x=6 is '.'? Wait, the board row 1: . . . . . 0 . 1 . . \n  - This means: x=0: ., x=1: ., x=2: ., x=3: ., x=4: ., x=5: 0, x=6: ., x=7: 1, x=8: ., x=9: . \n  - So x=6 is indeed empty. But wait, is there any body? No, both snakes only have heads. So moving to (6,1) is empty. However, snake 1 is at (7,1). If I move right to (6,1), and snake 1 moves left to (6,1), then we would have a head-on collision, and both die. That's a risk.\n\nSimilarly, if snake 1 moves right to (8,1) or up/down, that's fine. But if it moves left, it could collide.\n\nNow, I need to think about apples. The closest apples are:\n- (2,3): relative to (5,1), that's left 3 and up 2. Manhattan distance: 3+2=5.\n- (3,6): right 1 and up 5? Wait, (5,1) to (3,6): delta x = -2, delta y = +5, distance 7.\n- (6,8): right 1 and up 7, distance 8.\n- (8,6): right 3 and up 5, distance 8.\n- (3,9): left 2 and up 8, distance 10.\n\nSo the closest apple is at (2,3) with distance 5. But I need to consider if I can safely reach it.\n\nAlso, I have only 150 turns, and apples give growth. Since I'm at turn 0, I have time.\n\nNow, enemy snake 1 is at (7,1). It might move towards apples as well. From (7,1), possible apples: (8,6) is right 1 and up 5, distance 6; (6,8) is left 1 and up 7, distance 8; (3,6) is left 4 and up 5, distance 9; etc. So likely, it might move towards (8,6) or other apples.\n\nBut I don't know its strategy. I need to assume it might move towards me or away.\n\nTo minimize risk of head-on collision, I should avoid moving towards the enemy if possible. Currently, the enemy is at (7,1), and I am at (5,1). So moving right towards (6,1) brings me closer to the enemy, increasing collision risk if it moves left.\n\nMoving left to (4,1) moves away from the enemy, so less risk of immediate collision. But moving left might lead me towards apple at (2,3), which is left and up.\n\nMoving up to (5,2) or down to (5,0) might also be safe.\n\nNow, I need to consider future moves. If I move left to (4,1), then from there I can move towards (2,3). If I move up to (5,2), I might eventually go to (3,6) or (6,8), but those are farther.\n\nAlso, I should consider the board size and avoid getting trapped. Since it's early, no walls are close.\n\nLet's list all moves and evaluate safety:\n\n- UP: to (5,2) - safe, no immediate death. Future: from (5,2), I can go up, down, left, right. But up to (5,3) is empty? From board, row 3: . . A . . . . . . so at x=5, it's empty? Row 3: \"3 . . A . . . . . .\" so x=0: ., x=1: ., x=2: A, x=3: .? Wait, the string: \"3 . . A . . . . . .\" but this is the row label? Let's read the board properly.\n\nThe board is printed with row numbers on the left and column numbers below. So:\n\nRow 9: . . . A . . . . . . \nRow 8: . . . . . . A . . . \nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . . \nRow 6: . . . A . . . . A . \nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . . \nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . . \nRow 3: . . A . . . . . . . \nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . . \nRow 1: . . . . . 0 . 1 . . \nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . . \n\nAnd columns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo for row 1: \nx=0: .\nx=1: .\nx=2: .\nx=3: .\nx=4: .\nx=5: 0\nx=6: .\nx=7: 1\nx=8: .\nx=9: .\n\nNow, for UP move to (5,2): row 2 is all dots, so empty. Safe.\n\nDOWN to (5,0): row 0 all dots, safe.\n\nLEFT to (4,1): from row 1, x=4 is ., safe.\n\nRIGHT to (6,1): from row 1, x=6 is ., safe but risk of head-on if enemy moves left.\n\nNow, among safe moves, I need to favor moves that keep multiple future options open and move towards apples.\n\nAlso, I should avoid moves that might lead to dead ends early on.\n\nSince the board is open, all moves seem to have multiple options from there.\n\nBut I need to consider which apple to target first. The closest apple is at (2,3). From (5,1), if I go left, I can go to (4,1), then (3,1), then (2,1), then (2,2), then (2,3) to eat apple. But I need to ensure that path is safe from enemy movements.\n\nSimilarly, from (5,1), if I go up to (5,2), then I might go left to (4,2), etc., but that might not be towards the closest apple.\n\nThe apple at (3,6) is also close, but from (5,1), going up to (5,2), (5,3), etc., but (3,6) is left and up.\n\nLet's compute Manhattan distances to all apples from (5,1):\n- (2,3): |5-2| + |1-3| = 3 + 2 = 5\n- (3,6): |5-3| + |1-6| = 2 + 5 = 7\n- (6,8): |5-6| + |1-8| = 1 + 7 = 8\n- (8,6): |5-8| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8\n- (3,9): |5-3| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10\n\nSo (2,3) is the closest.\n\nNow, if I move towards it, I should go left. But going left immediately might be good.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the enemy. Enemy at (7,1). If I go left to (4,1), enemy might go left to (6,1) or (5,1)? If enemy goes left to (6,1), that's fine, since I'm at (4,1). But if enemy goes right to (8,1), that's away. Or up/down.\n\nThe risk of head-on collision is only if both move into the same cell. So if I move left to (4,1), and enemy moves left to (6,1), no collision. If enemy moves to (5,1), that would be if I stay? But I'm moving, so no. Only if I move to a cell and enemy moves to the same cell.\n\nSo, for example, if I move right to (6,1), and enemy moves left to (6,1), collision. If I move left to (4,1), and enemy moves left to (6,1), no collision. If I move up to (5,2), and enemy moves to (5,2)? But enemy is at (7,1), so to move to (5,2), it would need to move left twice? No, each move is one step. So from (7,1), to reach (5,2), it would need to move left twice, but in one turn, it can only move one step. So possible moves for enemy: from (7,1), it can go to (6,1), (8,1), (7,2), (7,0). So it can only reach cells adjacent to (7,1). So the only cells it can move to that are also adjacent to me? My adjacent cells are (5,0), (5,2), (4,1), (6,1). Enemy's adjacent cells are (6,1), (8,1), (7,2), (7,0). So common cell is (6,1). So if I move to (6,1) and enemy moves to (6,1), collision. For other moves, no common cells. So moving left, up, or down from my position does not share any cells with enemy's possible moves. Therefore, moving left, up, or down is safe from immediate head-on collision.\n\nSo RIGHT move is risky because of possible collision with enemy if it moves left.\n\nTherefore, I should avoid RIGHT for now.\n\nNow, among LEFT, UP, DOWN, which one to choose?\n\nI want to move towards an apple. The closest apple is at (2,3), which is left and up. So moving left or up could be towards it.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,1), then from there, I can move left again to (3,1) towards (2,3). Or up to (4,2), etc.\n\nIf I move UP to (5,2), then from there, I can move left towards (2,3) or up towards (3,6), etc.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,0), that might not be towards any apple. Apples are at y=3,6,8,9, so down to y=0 is away from all apples. So probably not optimal.\n\nSo between LEFT and UP, both seem good.\n\nNow, consider the board geometry. If I move UP, I might encounter the apple at (3,6) later, but that's farther. If I move LEFT, I go directly towards (2,3).\n\nAlso, if I move LEFT, I am moving away from the enemy, which might be safer in the long run, as the enemy might go towards apples on the right side, like (8,6) or (6,8).\n\nSo, I think moving LEFT is a good choice.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are any other considerations. The game has 150 turns, and I need to eat 50 apples to win immediately, but that's far away. So I should focus on safe growth.\n\nAlso, since I have no body yet, I can make tight turns later without self-collision.\n\nSo, for this move, I will choose LEFT.\n\nBut wait, I need to think about the enemy's possible move. If I move left, and the enemy moves left to (6,1), that's fine. But if the enemy moves up to (7,2), that might be towards apple (6,8) or (8,6). Similarly, if it moves down to (7,0), that might be away. But I cannot control enemy.\n\nSince I am avoiding RIGHT, I am safe from head-on.\n\nNow, for the long-term plan, I should note that I am moving towards the apple at (2,3) and will try to eat it in the next few turns.\n\nSo, my rationale: I will move left to position myself towards the closest apple at (2,3) and away from the enemy to avoid immediate collision risks.\n\nFinally, my move must be one word: LEFT.\n\nBut wait, the instruction says: \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\n\nSo I should output only the move. But I can have reasoning before that.\n\nIn the response, I should have the reasoning and then the move on the last line.\n\nSo, for my response, I will write the reasoning and then LEFT.\n\nBut let's double-check if moving left is indeed safe and optimal.\n\nIs there any other apple I should consider? What about the apple at (3,6)? From (5,1), if I go up, I might reach it in fewer steps? Let's see: from (5,1) to (3,6), the Manhattan distance is 7, but actual path might be longer. If I go directly up, I need to go up 5 steps and left 2 steps, so at least 7 moves. But if I go left first, I can go to (2,1) then up to (2,6)? But (2,3) is on the way? Actually, from (5,1) to (3,6), the shortest path is to go left to (3,1) then up to (3,6), which is 2 left and 5 up, same 7 moves. But if I go left to (4,1), then to (3,1), then to (3,2), etc., but that path might have obstacles? No obstacles, only apples and snakes.\n\nBut since there is an apple at (2,3), which is closer, I should go for that first.\n\nAlso, after eating that apple, I grow, so my body will be longer, but since it's early, it might not matter much.\n\nSo, I think moving left is good.\n\nAlternatively, moving up to (5,2) might allow me to go to (3,6) later, but (3,6) is farther, and I might miss the closer apple.\n\nMoreover, if I move left, I might block the enemy from coming to the left side, but since enemy is at right, it might not come.\n\nSo, I'll go with LEFT.\n\nNow, for the response, I need to include a long-term plan or strategy note for future self. The instruction says: \"You may also write a long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo, I should write a note before the move.\n\nFor example, \"Plan: Move towards apple at (2,3). Avoid right moves to prevent collision with enemy. After eating this apple, consider going for apple at (3,6).\"\n\nBut since the plan will be shown as last rationale on next turn, I should keep it concise.\n\nNow, the move is LEFT.\n\nSo, my response:\n\nRationale: I am moving left to approach the closest apple at (2,3) and to avoid potential head-on collision with the enemy snake at (7,1) since moving right could lead to collision if the enemy moves left. Moving down would take me away from all apples, and moving up might be less direct to the nearest apple.\n\nPlan: Continue towards apple at (2,3) while monitoring enemy movement. After eating, target apple at (3,6) or (6,8) based on safety.\n\nLEFT\n\nBut wait, the instruction says: \"Do not mention future directions after it.\" meaning after the move word, I should not add anything. So in the reasoning, I can mention future plans, but on the last line, only the move word.\n\nAlso, I should not perform web searches, which I haven't.\n\nSo, I think this isI am at (5,1) with no body segments, and the enemy is at (7,1). The closest apple is at (2,3) with a Manhattan distance of 5. I must avoid moving right to (6,1) because that could lead to a head-on collision if the enemy moves left to (6,1). Moving down to (5,0) would take me away from all apples and reduce future options. Moving up to (5,2) is safe but less direct towards the nearest apple. Moving left to (4,1) positions me towards the apple at (2,3) while avoiding the enemy and keeps multiple future paths open.\n\nPlan: Move towards the apple at (2,3) while avoiding direct paths towards the enemy. After eating, consider targeting the apple at (3,6) or (6,8) based on safety and enemy movements.\n\nLEFT",

Is it empty? Yes. Is it blocked by Snake #1? No (Snake #1 is at (7, 3)). **Safe.**\n2.  **DOWN (to (3, 0)):** Valid coordinate. Is it empty? Yes. **Safe.**\n3.  **LEFT (to (2, 1)):** Valid coordinate. Is it empty? Yes. **Safe.**\n4.  **RIGHT (to (4, 1)):** Valid coordinate. Is it empty? Yes. **Safe.**\n\nAll four directions are immediately safe regarding walls and current obstacles.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Apples and Strategy**\nApples are at: (3, 9), (8, 6), (2, 3), (6, 8), (3, 6).\nMy position is (3, 1). The closest apples are (2, 3) (Manhattan distance 3) and (3, 6) (Manhattan distance 5).\n\n*   **Target (2, 3):** Needs movement LEFT and UP.\n    *   To reach (2, 3), I must pass through (2, 1) or (2, 2), or (3, 2), (3, 3).\n    *   My last move was LEFT. That means I came from (4, 1). Wait, my last move rationale said \"LEFT\", but my head was at (3, 1) in the previous turn (Turn 1). If I moved LEFT from (4, 1), I would be at (3, 1). That matches. So I came from (4, 1).\n    *   Moving **LEFT** to (2, 1) moves me directly towards the closest apple (2, 3). Distance to (2, 3) becomes 2.\n    *   Moving **UP** to (3, 2) moves me towards the cluster of apples in the north. Distance to (2, 3) becomes 2. Distance to (3, 6) becomes 4.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** to (4, 1) moves away from (2, 3) (distance becomes 4) and stays distanced from (3, 6). This seems suboptimal for immediate gains.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** to (3, 0) moves away from all apples. Suboptimal.\n\n**Step 3: Enemy Snake Consideration**\nEnemy Snake #1 is at (7, 3). It is far away (Manhattan distance 7). It is likely targeting apples in the upper right quadrant (8, 6), (6, 8), (3, 9). It is not an immediate threat to my intended path towards the bottom-left apple (2, 3).\n\n**Step 4: Comparing UP vs LEFT**\n*   **Option LEFT (to 2, 1):**\n    *   Moves towards apple at (2, 3).\n    *   Next turn options from (2, 1): UP (2, 2), LEFT (1, 1), RIGHT (3, 1 - coming back), DOWN (2, 0).\n    *   This path takes me to the bottom-left corner area. While generally open, going deep into a corner can be restrictive if I eat many apples there. However, (2, 3) is very close.\n*   **Option UP (to 3, 2):**\n    *   Moves towards apples at (2, 3) and (3, 6).\n    *   Next turn options from (3, 2): UP (3, 3), DOWN (3, 1), LEFT (2, 2), RIGHT (4, 2).\n    *   This keeps me more central. From (3, 3), I am in a very good position to hit (2, 3) or (3, 6).\n    *   My previous turn I considered moving UP (\"moving up might be less direct to the nearest apple\"). I moved LEFT. I am now at (3, 1).\n    *   Continuing LEFT towards (2, 3) is a direct path. However, looking at the board, the apple at (2, 3) is isolated in the bottom left relative to the other apples (which form a vertical line in the center/right). The apple at (3, 6) is closer to the cluster at (6, 8) and (8, 6).\n    *   Let's re-verify the distance. From (3, 1) to (2, 3) is 2 moves (Left, Up). From (3, 1) to (3, 6) is 5 moves (Up, Up, Up, Up, Up).\n    *   The apple at (2, 3) is significantly closer.\n    *   However, if I move UP to (3, 2), I can reach (3, 3) next turn. From (3, 3), I am equidistant to (2, 3) and (3, 6).\n    *   If I move LEFT to (2, 1), I am forced to eventually go UP to get the apple. If I move UP to (3, 2), I can go LEFT or UP next.\n    *   The board shows (3, 6) is an apple. (3, 9) is also an apple. Moving UP aligns me with this vertical column of apples at x=3. Moving LEFT aligns me with x=2 (only one apple at 2,3).\n    *   Vertical columns are often easier to traverse for snakes than jumping between x-coordinates.\n    *   My last rationale mentioned \"Avoiding head-on collision with the enemy snake at (7,1)\". Wait, Snake #1 is at (7, 3). My last rationale mentioned (7, 1). That was a typo in the rationale or I misread the previous state. The enemy is at (7, 3). It's not moving to (6, 3) to collide with me.\n    *   Let's look at the apples again: (3,9), (8,6), (2,3), (6,8), (3,6).\n    *   My head is at (3,1).\n    *   The apple at (3,6) is reachable by moving UP 5 times. This is a safe, predictable path.\n    *   The apple at (2,3) requires Left, Up, Up.\n    *   If I move UP now to (3,2), I am on the x=3 line. I can grab (3,6) then (3,9).\n    *   If I move LEFT to (2,1), I have to detour to x=2, get the apple, then come back to x=3 for the others, or go to x=0.\n    *   Staying on x=3 seems more efficient for the cluster of apples (3,6) and (3,9).\n    *   Wait, is there a snake at (7,3)? Yes.\n    *   Is there a snake at (3,1)? Yes, that's me.\n    *   Is the cell (3,2) empty? Yes.\n    *   Is the cell (2,1) empty? Yes.\n    *   Let's check the map again.\n       9 A\n       8 . . . . . . A\n       6 . . A . . . A\n       3 . . A . . . 1\n       1 . . . 0\n    *   I am at x=3.\n    *   Apples at x=3: (3,6) and (3,9).\n    *   Apple at x=2: (2,3).\n    *   Apple at x=6: (6,8).\n    *   Apple at x=8: (8,6).\n    *   The most immediate benefit is grabbing the closest apple (2,3). However, looking at the geometry, moving UP to (3,2) puts me on a path to (3,6). If I go LEFT to (2,1), I go to (2,3). If I eat (2,3), I am at (2,3). Then I need to go to the next closest. Where is the next closest from (2,3)? (3,6) is distance 3 (Right, Up, Up). (3,9) is 7. (6,8) is 9.\n    *   If I stay at x=3, I can hit (3,6) then (3,9).\n    *   Let's assume the enemy at (7,3) moves. It can see apples at (8,6), (6,8). It likely moves UP or RIGHT.\n    *   If I move UP to (3,2), I am preparing to eat (3,6).\n    *   If I move LEFT to (2,1), I am preparing to eat (2,3).\n    *   (2,3) is 2 moves away. (3,6) is 5 moves away.\n    *   Getting an apple quickly is usually good.\n    *   BUT, eating (2,3) takes me to (2,3). From there, the path to (3,6) requires crossing back over.\n    *   Is there any reason NOT to go UP?\n    *   No walls. No self. No enemy.\n    *   Is there any reason NOT to go LEFT?\n    *   No.\n    *   Is there a preference?\n    *   \"Among remaining safe moves, favor moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available\".\n    *   From (3, 2), I can go Up, Down, Left, Right. All are likely safe.\n    *   From (2, 1), I can go Up, Down, Left, Right. All are likely safe.\n    *   \"move you closer to reachable apples\".\n    *   (2, 3) is distance 2. (3, 6) is distance 5.\n    *   Moving LEFT moves me closer to the closest apple.\n    *   However, let's look at the score. I have 0. Enemy has 0.\n    *   If I go UP, I am moving towards (3, 6). If I go LEFT, I am moving towards (2, 3).\n    *   Let's visualize the path.\n    *   Path UP: (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (3,5) -> (3,6). (Eat). Then (3,7) -> (3,8) -> (3,9). (Eat). 7 turns to eat 2 apples.\n    *   Path LEFT: (3,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3). (Eat). Then from (2,3): (2,4) -> (2,5) -> (2,6) -> (3,6). (Eat). Then (3,7) -> (3,8) -> (3,9). (Eat). Total turns: 2 (to first) + 4 (to second) + 3 (to third) = 9 turns.\n    *   The UP path is faster for getting 2 apples.\n    *   Wait, if I go LEFT, I get an apple in 2 turns. If I go UP, I get one in 5 turns.\n    *   However, after getting the first apple, the subsequent apples are much faster on the UP path.\n    *   What if the enemy goes for (3,6) or (3,9)? Enemy is at (7,3).\n    *   Enemy distance to (8,6): (7,3) -> (7,4) -> (7,5) -> (8,6). 3 turns.\n    *   Enemy distance to (6,8): (7,3) -> (7,4) -> (7,5) -> (7,6) -> (6,7) -> (6,8). 5 turns.\n    *   Enemy distance to (3,9): (7,3) -> (7,4)... very long.\n    *   Enemy distance to (3,6): (7,3) -> (6,3) -> (5,3) -> (4,3) -> (3,4) -> (3,5) -> (3,6). 6 turns.\n    *   My distance to (3,6): 5 turns.\n    *   My distance to (2,3): 2 turns.\n    *   My distance to (3,9) from (2,3): (2,3)->(2,4)->(2,5)->(2,6)->(3,6)->(3,7)->(3,8)->(3,9). 8 turns.\n    *   If I go LEFT, I eat (2,3) in 2 turns. Then I have to run to (3,6).\n    *   If I go UP, I eat (3,6) in 5 turns.\n    *   BUT, if I go UP, I pass through (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). These cells are open.\n    *   If I go LEFT, I am committing to a detour.\n    *   The prompt says: \"prefer moves that both: * increase your chance of safely eating apples, and * keep future options open\".\n    *   Going UP keeps me aligned with the vertical column of apples (3,6) and (3,9). This is a very open and clear path.\n    *   Going LEFT to (2,3) is also safe.\n    *   Let's look at the \"My last move information\". It says \"LEFT\". So I moved LEFT from (4,1) to (3,1).\n    *   If I continue LEFT to (2,1), I am continuing the path to (2,3).\n    *   But wait. Is (2,1) safe? Yes.\n    *   Is (3,2) safe? Yes.\n    *   Which is better?\n    *   Let's look at the \"turn: 2 / 150\". It's early.\n    *   The apple at (2,3) is closer.\n    *   Let's assume I go UP.\n    *   If I go UP to (3,2), I am now on the x=3 line.\n    *   Next turn, I can go LEFT to (2,2). Distance to (2,3) is 1.\n    *   Next turn, I can go UP to (3,3).\n    *   If I go UP to (3,2), I can potentially change my mind and go to (2,3).\n    *   If I go LEFT to (2,1), I am locked into the x=2 column until I go up to y=3.\n    *   The x=3 column has apples at y=6 and y=9.\n    *   The x=2 column has an apple at y=3.\n    *   The x=2 column also has empty space above y=3.\n    *   If I go UP to (3,2), I am \"on the way\" to (3,6).\n    *   If I go LEFT to (2,1), I am \"on the way\" to (2,3).\n    *   Let's check for immediate danger.\n    *   Enemy at (7,3).\n    *   If enemy moves UP to (7,4).\n    *   If I move UP to (3,2).\n    *   If I move LEFT to (2,1).\n    *   No collision.\n    *   Let's consider the geometry of the board.\n    *   The apple at (2,3) is isolated from the other apples.\n    *   The apples at (3,6) and (3,9) are on a line. (6,8) and (8,6) are another group.\n    *   Getting the isolated apple first might be a good \"low hanging fruit\" strategy.\n    *   Distance to (2,3) is 2.\n    *   Distance to (3,6) is 5.\n    *   Grabbing the closer apple reduces the chance of the enemy grabbing it (although enemy is far).\n    *   However, going UP to (3,2) puts me in a position where I can pivot.\n    *   If I go UP, I can choose next turn to go LEFT to (2,2) and then UP to (2,3).\n    *   That's a 3-turn path to (2,3).\n    *   If I go LEFT, it's a 2-turn path.\n    *   If I go UP, I have a 5-turn path to (3,6).\n    *   If I go UP, I am effectively starting the \"main\" path.\n    *   Let's reconsider the prompt's example logic. \"Snake #1 apples: 0\". \"My snake apples: 0\".\n    *   \"Move closer to reachable apples\".\n    *   (2,3) is reachable.\n    *   (3,6) is reachable.\n    *   (2,3) is closer.\n    *   Wait, look at the board state again.\n    *   9 . . .

Getting it puts me at (2,3).\nFrom (2,3), I can go to (3,6).\nThe path from (2,3) to (3,6) is (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6).\nOr (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6).\n\nIf I go UP to (3,2), I can go to (3,6) directly.\n(3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6).\n\nLet's assume I want to eat (2,3).\nLast turn I moved LEFT to (3,1). I am 2 moves away.\nThis turn if I move LEFT to (2,1), I am 1 move away (UP to 2,2). Wait, (2,2) is empty.\nNext turn I move UP to (2,3) and eat.\nTotal time: 2 turns.\n\nIf I want to eat (3,6).\nThis turn UP to (3,2). (Distance 5).\nNext turn UP to (3,3). (Distance 4).\n... 5 turns total.\n\nThe prompt says \"Closest apple\".\nDistance to (2,3): |3-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3.\nDistance to (3,6): |3-3| + |1-6| = 5.\nWait, is my head at (3,1)? Yes.\nIs (2,3) at x=2, y=3? Yes.\nManhattan distance: (3-2) + (3-1) = 1 + 2 = 3.\nManhattan distance to (3,6): (3-3) + (6-1) = 5.\nOkay, so (2,3) is definitely closer.\n\nWhy would I NOT go for the closest apple?\nIf it traps me.\nIf the enemy can easily get it.\nIf I can get a \"better\" apple faster.\nHere, \"better\" means closer to the center of action.\nBut I have no body. I am fast.\nI should definitely try to eat the apple at (2,3).\nTo get to (2,3) from (3,1), I need to move LEFT and UP.\nI should move LEFT now.\nMy last move was LEFT.\nIf I move LEFT again, I am at (2,1).\nIf I move UP, I am at (3,2).\nFrom (3,2), I can move LEFT next turn to (2,2).\nFrom (2,1), I can move UP next turn to (2,2).\nBoth paths allow me to reach (2,2).\nIf I move LEFT to (2,1), I am strictly closer to the apple (Manhattan 2 vs 3).\nAlso, moving LEFT avoids the y=1 boundary (bottom row). Moving UP to (3,2) is safer than moving DOWN to (3,0).\nI have 4 options.\nLEFT -> (2,1). Safe.\nUP -> (3,2). Safe.\nRIGHT -> (4,1). Safe.\nDOWN -> (3,0). Safe.\n\nLet's think about the enemy.\nEnemy at (7,3).\nIt sees (8,6), (6,8). It likely moves UP or RIGHT.\nIf it moves UP, it goes to (7,4).\nIf it moves RIGHT, it goes to (8,3).\nIf it moves UP, it might block the path to (6,8) or (8,6) later.\nI am at (3,1).\nI want (2,3).\nEnemy wants (8,6) or (6,8).\nWe are far apart. No conflict.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2,1), I am moving towards the apple.\nIf I move UP to (3,2), I am moving away from the *closest* apple, but towards the *cluster*.\nHowever, the \"closest apple\" rule is very strong in snake logic.\nLet's check the \"My last move information\" again.\n\"I am moving left to approach the closest apple at (2,3)\".\nOkay, so the intent was to go to (2,3).\nI am at (3,1).\nTo get there, I need to go LEFT and UP.\nI should probably go LEFT now.\nWhy? Because if I go UP, I am effectively delaying the path to (2,3).\nAlso, if I go LEFT, I occupy (2,1).\nIf I go UP, I occupy (3,2).\nIf I go LEFT, I can then go UP to (2,2) next turn.\nIf I go UP, I can go LEFT to (2,2) next turn.\nThe result next turn is the same: at (2,2).\nBut wait, if I go LEFT now, I am on the x=2 line.\nIf I go UP now, I am on the x=3 line.\nIf something changes, being on x=2 might be better or worse.\nBut for the purpose of getting the apple at (2,3), being on x=2 (at y=1) is one step closer than being on x=3 (at y=2).\nActually, from (3,1), going LEFT puts me at (2,1).\nFrom (2,1), going UP puts me at (2,2).\nFrom (2,2), going UP puts me at (2,3). (Eat).\nTotal moves: 3.\n\nFrom (3,1), going UP puts me at (3,2).\nFrom (3,2), going LEFT puts me at (2,2).\nFrom (2,2), going UP puts me at (2,3). (Eat).\nTotal moves: 3.\n\nSo both routes take 3 turns to eat the apple.\nWait, if I go LEFT to (2,1), I can go UP to (2,2), then UP to (2,3). (3 moves).\nIf I go UP to (3,2), I can go LEFT to (2,2), then UP to (2,3). (3 moves).\nSo the distance to the apple is 3 moves either way.\nHowever, if I go LEFT to (2,1), I am \"commited\" to the x=2 column.\nIf I go UP to (3,2), I am \"commited\" to the x=3 column for one move.\nIs there an advantage to being at (3,2)?\n(3,2) is closer to (3,6) (distance 4) than (2,3) is to (3,6) (distance 3).\nWait, (2,3) to (3,6) is 3 moves (Right, Up, Up).\n(3,2) to (3,6) is 4 moves (Up, Up, Up, Up).\nSo after eating (2,3), I am closer to (3,6) than if I were at (3,2) (before eating).\nWait, I won't be at (3,2) if I eat (2,3). I will be at (2,3).\nSo after eating (2,3), I am at (2,3). Distance to (3,6) is 3.\nIf I don't eat (2,3) and stay on x=3, I am at (3,2). Distance to (3,6) is 4.\nSo eating (2,3) is \"better\" for reaching (3,6) than just moving UP.\n\nSo, plan: Go LEFT to (2,1).\nWait, is there any downside?\n(2,1) is close to the wall at x=0.\nIf I eat the apple at (2,3), my body will be at (2,2) and (2,1).\nI will be growing.\nThen I will go to (3,6).\nThe path (3,6) -> (3,9) is a straight line.\nThe path (2,3) -> (3,6) -> (3,9) involves a turn at x=3.\nThis is fine.\n\nLet's re-verify the distance calculation to (2,3).\nFrom (3,1).\nLEFT to (2,1). UP to (2,2). UP to (2,3).\n3 moves.\nMy last move was LEFT.\nIf I move LEFT again, I am at (2,1).\nThis seems consistent with \"move left to approach the closest apple\".\n\nWhat if I move UP?\nDistance to (3,6) is 5.\nDistance to (2,3) is 3.\nMoving UP increases distance to (2,3) to 4.\nSo moving UP is moving AWAY from the closest apple.\nMoving LEFT is moving TOWARDS the closest apple.\nTherefore, LEFT is the correct move.\n\nWait, what if there is a trap?\nIs (2,1) trapped? No, it has (1,1), (2,0), (3,1).\nIs (3,2) trapped? No.\nIs there any reason to avoid (2,1)?\nOnly if the enemy can reach it. Enemy is at (7,3). Impossible.\nIs there any reason to avoid (2,0) (if I go DOWN)? Yes, it's a corner.\nIs there any reason to avoid (3,0) (if I go DOWN)? Yes.\n\nSo, choices are LEFT or UP.\nLEFT: Approaches closest apple (2,3). Distance 3 turns.\nUP: Approaches (3,6). Distance 5 turns. Moves AWAY from (2,3).\n\nI should choose LEFT.\n\nWait, check the \"My last move information\" again.\n\"I am moving left to approach the closest apple at (2,3)\".\nThis is the rationale I gave in the previous turn.\nI moved LEFT.\nSo I am at (3,1).\nI still want to get to (2,3).\nI should continue to prepare to get (2,3).\nTo get (2,3), I need to go to (2,1) then (2,2) then (2,3).\nOr (3,2) then (2,2) then (2,3).\nGoing LEFT to (2,1) puts me in a better position to grab the apple if the enemy tries to go for it (unlikely).\nIt also keeps me on the path to the apple.\n\nWait, look at the \"Board state\".\nRow 1: \". . . 0 . . . . . .\"\nRow 0: \". . . . . . . . . .\"\nIf I go DOWN to (3,0), I am at the bottom row.\nIf I go LEFT to (2,1), I am at y=1.\nIf I go UP to (3,2), I am at y=2.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,1), I am at y=1.\n\nLet's consider if there is an apple at (3,6).\nYes.\nPath to (3,6) via (2,3):\n(3,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (2,5) -> (2,6) -> (3,6).\nLength: 7.\nPath to (3,6) directly:\n(3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3,3) -> (3,4) -> (3,5) -> (3,6).\nLength: 5.\nSo going directly to (3,6) is faster than going via (2,3).\nWhy did I choose (2,3) initially? Because it was closer.\nDistance to (2,3) = 3.\nDistance to (3,6) = 5.\nBut the \"value\" of (3,6) is that it's on the way to (3,9).\nIf I go to (2,3), I have to travel to (3,6) afterwards.\nIf I go to (3,6), I travel to (3,9) afterwards.\nTotal distance for two apples:\nVia (2,3): 3 + 3 + 2 = 8 moves. (Eat (2,3) at move 3, (3,6) at move 6? No. Move 3: (2,3). Move 4: (2,4). Move 5: (2,5). Move 6: (2,6). Move 7: (3,6). Eat. Total 7 moves).\nVia (3,6) directly: 5 + 3 = 8 moves. (Eat (3,6) at move 5. Move 6: (3,7). Move 7: (3,8). Move 8: (3,9). Eat).\nSo both paths take 8 moves to eat 2 apples.\nHowever, getting (2,3) gives a point earlier (turn 3 vs turn 5).\nGetting points early is good.\nAlso, (2,3) is a \"detour\" but it's a point.\nIf I go UP, I am delaying points.\nIf I go LEFT, I am getting points.\n\nIs there any danger in the \"delay\"?\nNo, the board is empty.\nIs there any benefit to getting points early?\nYes, I reach 50 faster (hypothetically).\nAlso, if the game ends early (opponent dies), I have a point.\n\nSo, LEFT is better than UP.\nWhat about RIGHT?\nRIGHT moves me to (4,1). Distance to (3,6) is 5+1=6. Distance to (2,3) is 4. Bad.\nWhat about DOWN?\nDOWN moves me to (3,0). Distance to (3,6) is 6. Distance to (2,3) is 4. Bad.\n\nSo, LEFT or UP.\nI prefer LEFT to secure the closer apple (2,3).\n\nWait, is there an apple at (2,3)? Yes.\nIs it safe? Yes.\nIs the path clear? Yes.\nI will go LEFT.\n\nOne final check. The \"My last move information\" says \"Moving directly backwards into your own body ... counts as hitting yourself\".\nMy body is empty. So I can't hit myself.\nI can't hit Snake #1.\nI can't hit walls (as long as I stay 0-9).\nI can't hit apples (apples are passable, you just eat them and grow).\n\nSo, LEFT is the move.\n\nWait, I should check the \"Rules\" about apples.\n\"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point\".\nIt doesn't say I die if I move onto an apple. It just grows.\nSo apples are safe cells.\nThe only danger is walls, snakes, and \"moving backwards into own body\" (which doesn't apply here).\n\nFinal decision: Go LEFT to approach (2,3).\n\nWait, is there any reason to go UP?\n\"keep future options open\".\nIf I go UP to (3,2), I can go LEFT to (2,2) or UP to (3,3).\nIf I go LEFT to (2,1), I can go UP to (2,2) or LEFT to (1,1).\n(3,2) is slightly more flexible (can go to x=4). But (2,1) is still flexible.\nThe prompt says \"prefer moves that ... increase your chance of safely eating apples\".\n(2,3) is closer.\nSo LEFT.\n\nWait, let me check the \"Last move information\" again.\n\"My last move information: ... I am moving left to approach the closest apple at (2,3)\".\nMy head was at (3,1) in Turn 1.\nIf I moved LEFT, I am at (2,1).\nWait.\nTurn 1: Head at (3,1). (Given).\nLast move: LEFT.\nResult: (2,1).\nWait, the prompt says \"Turn: 2\".\n\"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (3, 1)\".\nSo I am currently at (3, 1).\nThis implies that moving LEFT in the previous turn would have moved me to (3, 1) from (4, 1).\nSo my last move was LEFT. I am at (3, 1).\nOkay.\n\nSo, I am at (3, 1).\nI want to go to (2, 3).\nI should move LEFT to (2, 1).\n\nLet's assume I go UP to (3, 2).\nThen I am further away from (2, 3) and closer to (3, 6).\nBut (3, 6) is much further than (2, 3).\nSo UP is \"wrong\" for the immediate goal.\n\nI will move LEFT.\n\nWait, is there any apple at (3, 1)? No.\nIs there any snake at (3, 1)? Yes, me.\nIs there any snake at (2, 1)? No.\nIs there any wall at (2, 1)? No.\n\nSo, LEFT.\n\nWait, let's consider the enemy.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (6, 3).\nThen the enemy is at (6, 3).\nI am at (2, 1).\nNo collision.\n\nIf the enemy moves UP to (7, 4).\nNo collision.\n\nSo, safety is fine.\n\nConclusion: Move LEFT to get closer to apple (2,3).\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to (2,1). Next turn move UP to (2,2). Next turn move UP to (2,3) and eat apple. Then target (3,6).\n\nOne check: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body\".\nIf I am at (3,1) and I just came from (4,1) (by moving LEFT).\nIf I move RIGHT, I go to (4,1). That is backwards into my own body? No, my body is empty. \"Body: none\".\nSo I can move RIGHT too. But it's not useful.\n\nSo, LEFT.\n\nWait, look at the board again.\nRow 3: \". . A . . . . 1 . .\"\nApple at (2,3). Enemy at (7,3).\nRow 1: \". . . 0 . . . . . .\"\nI am at (3,1).\nIf I move LEFT, I am at (2,1).\nIf I move UP, I am at (3,2).\nIf I move DOWN, I am at (3,0).\nIf I move RIGHT, I am at (4,1).\n\n(3,6) is an apple.\n(3,9) is an apple.\n(2,3) is an apple.\n\nIf I go LEFT, I commit to the bottom apple.\nIf I go UP, I commit to the middle apples.\n\nWhy is the bottom apple \"bad\"?\nIt requires me to turn at (2,3) to go to (3,6).\nIs there a \"dead end\"?\nNo.\nIs it slower?\nYes, but I get a point faster.\n\nI will take the point.\n\nLEFT.\n\nWait, I am overthinking.\n\"Closest apple\" is the heuristic.\nMove towards it.\n\nLEFT.\n\nOne last thing.\n\"Never choose a move that obviously kills you\".\n\"Obviously kills you\" means: Wall, Snake Body, Backwards into Self.\nNone of these apply to LEFT.\n\n\"Prefer moves that ... increase your chance of safely eating apples\".\nLEFT moves me closer to (2,3). Yes.\nUP moves me closer to (3,6). Yes, but further from (2,3).\n(2,3) is closer.\nSo LEFT.\n\n\"keep future options open\".\n(2,1) allows (1,1), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1).\n(3,2) allows (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (4,2).\nBoth are open.\n(2,1) is near the edge. (3,2) is more central.\nBut (2,3) is a point.\nI will take the point.\n\nDecision: LEFT.\n\nWait, is the apple at (2,3) visible?\nBoard:\nRow 9: . . . A . . . . . .\nRow 8: . . . . . .

Yes.\n\nOkay.\n\nFinal decision: LEFT.\n\nOne thing: The prompt says \"If multiple snakes are still alive at the final turn, the snake with the most apples wins.\"\nIt's turn 2. I need apples.\nThe closest apple is (2,3).\nI should go get it.\n\nLEFT.\n\nWait, is there any way the enemy gets (2,3)?\nEnemy is at (7,3).\nDistance: |7-2| + |3-3| = 5.\nI am at (3,1).\nDistance: |3-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3.\nI am closer.\n\nOkay.\n\nI will move LEFT.\n\nPlan: Target apple at (2,3).\nMove: LEFT.\n\nWait, if I move LEFT, I am at (2,1).\nNext turn I can go UP to (2,2).\nNext turn UP to (2,3). Eat.\nThis is a good plan.\n\nIf I go UP, I am at (3,2).\nNext turn LEFT to (2,2).\nNext turn UP to (2,3). Eat.\nSame speed.\nBut going LEFT now gets me to x=2 faster.\nIf something happens to the apple, I am closer.\nI will go LEFT.\n\nWait, I should check if (2,1) is a wall.\nNo, walls are x < 0 or x > 9 or y < 0 or y > 9.\n(2,1) is within 0-9.\n\nOkay.\n\nDecision is LEFT.\n\nWait, let's look at the \"My last move information\" again.\n\"I am moving left to approach the closest apple at (2,3)\".\nMy head is at (3,1).\nSo I came from (4,1).\nI moved LEFT.\nI want to continue to (2,3).\nMoving LEFT again is the right thing to do.\n\nOkay.\n\nFinal Answer seems to be LEFT.\n\nWait, is there any reason to go UP?\n\"Plan: Continue towards apple at (2,3) while monitoring enemy movement.

Target (3,6) after eating.\"\nThen \"LEFT\".\n\nWait, the prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns.\"\nSo I should write:\n\"Plan: Move LEFT to approach apple at (2,3).

From there I can reach the apple at (3, 6) in 1 move (UP) or (4, 5) in 2 moves (RIGHT+DOWN). This also seems productive.\n\nLet's consider the enemy snake 1. It is at (8, 5). The closest apple to it is (8, 6) directly above. It is likely to go UP to (8, 6). (8, 6) is also an apple on the board.\nIf Snake 1 goes UP to (8, 6), it eats the apple there.\nMy apples are at (3, 6), (4, 5), (3, 9), etc.\n(3, 6) is 1 step away from my potential new position (3, 5) if I go UP.\n(4, 5) is 1 step away from my potential new position (4, 4) if I go RIGHT.\n\nLet's look at the path options.\nIf I go **UP** to (3, 5):\n- Next turn I can go UP to (3, 6) and eat the apple.\n- Or I can go RIGHT to (4, 5) and eat that apple.\nThis position looks very strong.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (4, 4):\n- Next turn I can go UP to (4, 5) and eat the apple.\n- Or I can go LEFT (back to 3,4) or UP-LEFT (to 3,5 then 3,6).\nThis is also strong.\n\nComparing (3, 5) and (4, 4):\n- (3, 5) puts me in column 3, where there is an apple at (3, 6) and (3, 9).\n- (4, 4) puts me in column 4, where there is an apple at (4, 5).\n\nLet's look at the board layout again.\nApple at (3, 9) is far North.\nApple at (3, 6) is North.\nApple at (4, 5) is North-East.\nApple at (6, 8) is North-East.\nApple at (8, 6) is East.\n\nMy position is (3, 4).\nGoing UP to (3, 5) aligns me perfectly with the column 3 apples and the row 5/6 apples.\nGoing RIGHT to (4, 4) moves me away from the column 3 apples slightly.\n\nLet's check safety for the next turn.\nIf I go UP to (3, 5):\n- My body will be at (3, 4) and (2, 4).\n- Snake 1 likely goes to (8, 6).\n- I can then go UP to (3, 6) to eat the apple. That cell is currently empty.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 4):\n- My body will be at (3, 4) and (2, 4).\n- I can go UP to (4, 5) to eat the apple.\n\nBoth are safe.\nLet's see if there's a trap.\nApple at (3, 6) is a cluster with (3, 9) and (4, 5).\nThe board is open. No obstacles.\n\nLet's consider the \"Rationale\" from the previous turn.\nThe previous turn I moved RIGHT (from 2,4 to 3,4).\nWait, the previous turn I was at (2,4). The move was RIGHT to (3,4).\nMy body length is 2. Head (3,4) and Body (2,4).\nIf I move UP to (3,5), my body becomes (3,4) and (2,4).\nIf I move RIGHT to (4,4), my body becomes (3,4) and (2,4).\n\nI will prioritize the apple at (3, 6) because it's closest (2 steps).\nTo get to (3, 6) efficiently, I should align myself in the same column.\nCurrent column: 3.\nTarget: (3, 6).\nMoving UP keeps me in column 3.\nMoving RIGHT takes me to column 4. To get to (3, 6) from (4, 4), I need to go UP-LEFT. That's 2 turns (turn 8: UP to 4,5 or LEFT to 3,4; wait, from 4,4 I can go LEFT to 3,4 (back) or UP to 4,5).\nActually, from (4, 4):\n- Turn 8 UP to (4, 5) (EAT APPLE).\n- Turn 9 LEFT to (3, 5).\n- Turn 10 UP to (3, 6) (EAT APPLE).\n\nFrom (3, 5):\n- Turn 8 UP to (3, 6) (EAT APPLE).\n- Turn 9 RIGHT to (4, 6).\n- Turn 10 UP to (4, 7).\n\nOr from (3, 5):\n- Turn 8 RIGHT to (4, 5) (EAT APPLE).\n- Turn 9 DOWN to (4, 4).\n- Turn 10 LEFT to (3, 4).\n\nLet's map out the turns from (3, 5):\nTurn 7: Move UP to (3, 5).\nTurn 8: Move UP to (3, 6) (Eat Apple). Length becomes 3.\nTurn 9: Options... (3, 7), (2, 6), (4, 6).\nTurn 10: Target (3, 9) or (4, 5).\n\nFrom (4, 4):\nTurn 7: Move RIGHT to (4, 4).\nTurn 8: Move UP to (4, 5) (Eat Apple). Length becomes 3.\nTurn 9: Options...\nTurn 10: Target (3, 6) or (6, 8).\n\nThe apple at (3, 6) is at a location that is North.\nThe apple at (4, 5) is at a location that is North-East.\nThe apple at (3, 9) is North.\n\nThe cluster of (3,6), (4,5), (3,9) is in the top-left quadrant relative to me.\nSnake 1 is at bottom-right (8,5). It is far away.\nThe apples at (8,6), (6,8) are in the bottom-right.\nSnake 1 will likely go for (8,6) or (6,8).\nI have free access to the top-left apples.\n\nIs there any danger in moving UP?\nMy body is (2,4).\nIf I go UP to (3,5), my body follows to (3,4).\nNext turn, if I go UP to (3,6), my body follows to (3,5).\nI am moving in a straight line (UP). This is a valid path.\n\nIs there any danger in moving RIGHT?\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,4), body to (3,4).\nNext turn UP to (4,5), body to (4,4).\nAlso a valid path.\n\nLet's look at the board map.\n```\n 9 . . . A . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . A . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . A . . . . A .\n 5 . . . . A . . . 1 .\n 4 . . T 0 . . . . . .\n```\nMy head is 0. My tail is T.\nIf I move UP, I go to (3,5).\nIf I move RIGHT, I go to (4,4).\n\nThe board at (3,5) is empty.\nThe board at (4,4) is empty.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (3,6). It is at Y=6.\nMy current Y=4. 2 steps away.\nIf I go UP (to Y=5), I am 1 step away.\nIf I go RIGHT (to X=4, Y=4), distance to (3,6) is 1 in X, 2 in Y. Total 3.\n\nThe apple at (4,5). Y=5, X=4.\nMy current Y=4, X=3.\nIf I go UP (to 3,5), distance is 1 in X, 0 in Y. Total 1.\nIf I go RIGHT (to 4,4), distance is 0 in X, 1 in Y. Total 1.\n\nSo both moves place me 1 step away from an apple.\n(3,5) is 1 step from (4,5) (diagonal).\n(4,4) is 1 step from (4,5) (vertical).\n\nHowever, if I go UP to (3,5), I am also heading directly towards (3,6).\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,4), I am heading directly towards (4,5).\n\nLet's check the \"growth\" mechanic. \"Eating a nutritious apple causes a snake to grow for the next few rounds by having its tail remain in its current position.\"\nIf I eat at turn 8, my tail stays at (2,4) for turn 8. I move to (3,6). My body becomes (3,5), (3,4), (2,4).\nIf I eat at turn 8 (from 4,4), tail stays (2,4). Body (4,4), (3,4), (2,4).\n\nThe apple at (3,6) is surrounded by:\n(3,6) - Apple.\n(2,6) - Empty.\n(4,6) - Empty.\n(3,7) - Empty.\n(3,5) - Empty.\n\nThe apple at (4,5) is surrounded by:\n(4,5) - Apple.\n(4,4) - Empty.\n(4,6) - Empty.\n(3,5) - Empty.\n(5,5) - Empty.\n\nBoth are safe to approach.\n\nLet's look at Snake 1 again. Head (8,5).\nApple (8,6) is directly UP.\nSnake 1 will likely go UP to (8,6).\nI am far away. No collision risk.\n\nI will choose UP. This keeps me in the column with the apple at (3,6) and aligns me with the apple at (3,9).\nIt also gives me access to the apple at (4,5) immediately.\n\nLet's verify \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself\".\nMy current head is (3,4). My body is (2,4).\nIf I go LEFT, I go to (2,4) -> Death.\nIf I go UP, I go to (3,5).\nIf I go DOWN, I go to (3,3).\nIf I go RIGHT, I go to (4,4).\nUP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n\nI will go UP. This sets me up to grab the cluster of apples in the top-left.\n\nUP",

Moving into (8,5) would mean moving into our own body\u2014dangerous.\n- Moving up to (8,5) would involve moving into a body segment, so UP is not safe.\n- Moving down to (8,3): safe and keeps us near the apple at (8,6). But since there's an apple at (8,6), moving upward from (8,4) to (8,5) then to (8,6) makes sense if the first move is UP.\n- Wait, our head is at (8,4); moving UP would go to (8,5), which is free.\n\nHold on\u2014earlier, I mentioned the head at (8,4), but the board state indicates:\n- Head at (8,6)\n- Body at (8,5)\n\nWait, this conflicts with the prior data\u2014so the header states:\n\nYour snake (ID 1):\n  - Head: (8, 6)\n  - Body: [(8, 5)]\n\nThe last move was UP, which led the head to (8, 6), the apple at (8, 6). So our current head is at (8, 6)\u2014we just collected that apple and grew.\n\nNow, with head at (8, 6), and the body at (8, 5), our previous move was UP, which took us from (8, 5) to (8, 6).\n\nSo, after that move, the head is at (8, 6). The tail would now be at (8, 5) (the previous body segment). Now, the head is at (8, 6).\n\nLooking at the current position:\n\n- Head at (8, 6)\n- Body at [(8, 5)] (since the tail is at (8, 5))\n- We have just grown and are at (8, 6). The previous body segment is at (8, 5). No immediate danger there.\n\nNext move considerations:\n- Moving UP: would go to (8,7), containing an apple\n- Moving DOWN: to (8,5), which is our own body segment (deadly)\n- Moving LEFT: to (7,6), safe\n- Moving RIGHT: invalid\u2014outside the board (9,6)?\n\nYes, moving right would go to (9,6), which seems free. Let's verify:\n\n(9,6): off the right edge? No, x=9, y=6 is within the board\u2014so RIGHT is valid if not occupied.\n\nDoes the right cell (9,6) have any obstacle? Given the map, no apple or body there. \n\nAlso, the apple at (8,7) would be reachable by moving UP from (8,6).\n\nKey considerations:\n- Moving UP to (8,7): directly toward an apple, high reward\n- Moving LEFT to (7,6): safe, but leaves us farther from immediate apple\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,6): safe unless it's occupied, which is not indicated, so potentially safe\n- Moving DOWN to (8,5): would be into our own body, dangerous.\n\nSafety:\n- Moving UP: safe, targets apple\n- Moving LEFT: safe, options open but not closest to apple\n- Moving RIGHT: likely safe from info, potential to reach other apples later\n- Moving DOWN: dangerous\n\nPrioritizing immediate apple at (8,7), moving UP takes us directly there, promising quick growth and points. \n\nAdditionally, moving UP keeps us moving toward the most strategic apple, while the other options are less directly beneficial.\n\nNo immediate threats from enemies since their heads are at (3,5) and (3,4)\u2014far from our current position.\n\nTherefore, moving UP seems the best choice.\n\nUP",

No, the body list shows [(3, 4)], so I am currently length 2. The board shows the tail at (2, 4).\n*   **Target Apples:** There is a cluster of apples in the upper-left area: (3, 9), (3, 6), (4, 5). The apple at (3, 6) is particularly attractive as it is directly North in my current column (3).\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (8, 6), Body at [(8, 5)].\n    *   *Update:* The board state provided in the prompt description shows Snake #1's head at `(8, 6)` in the graphic.\n    *   *Text state:* The text summary says \"Head: (8, 6)\".\n    *   *Conflict:* Wait, looking closely at the provided \"Enemy snakes\" text: `Head: (8, 6), Body: [(8, 5)]`.\n    *   However, looking at the \"Board state\" graphic in the prompt:\n        `6 . . . A . . . . 1 .`\n        This places Snake #1's head at `(8, 6)`.\n        And:\n        `5 . . . 0 A . . . T .`\n        This places Snake #1's *tail* (T) at `(9, 5)`? No, wait.\n        `5 ... . . . . . T .`\n        Let's re-read the \"Enemy snakes\" list carefully.\n        \"Snake #1 - Head: (8, 6), Body: [(8, 5)], Apples: 1\".\n        And the \"Board state\" graphic has a '1' at (8, 6) and 'T' at (9, 5).\n        Let's check the text again: `Snake #1 - Head: (8, 6), Body: [(8, 5)]`.\n        The board graphic shows:\n        Row 6: `... . . . . . 1 .` (at index 8)\n        Row 5: `... . . . . . . T .` (at index 9)\n        Wait, the prompt says \"Body: [(8, 5)]\". If the head is (8,6), the body below it at (8,5) makes sense.\n        But the graphic shows 'T' at (9,5). Is that Snake #1's tail?\n        Let's assume the text description is the source of truth for coordinates. Snake #1 Head (8,6), Body (8,5).\n        This means Snake #1 is currently oriented North-South.\n\n**Move Evaluation (From Head at 3,4):**\n1.  **LEFT to (2, 4):** My current tail is at (2, 4). Moving into my tail is lethal. **Eliminated.**\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 3):** Empty. Safe.\n3.  **UP to (3, 5):** Empty. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 4):** Empty. Safe.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI am length 2. My body is currently at (2, 4) (from the previous turn).\nIf I move **UP** to (3, 5), my body will be (3, 4), (2, 4).\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (4, 4), my body will be (3, 4), (2, 4).\n\nI am aiming for the apple at (3, 6).\nIf I go UP to (3, 5), I am distance 1 from (3, 6).\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 4), I am distance |4-3| + |4-6| = 3 from (3, 6).\n\nAlso, Snake #1 is at (8, 6). There is an apple at (8, 6)? No, the apple list has (6, 8), (8, 7), etc.\nThe board graphic shows Snake #1 at (8, 6). There is no apple there.\nHowever, there is an apple at (8, 7) (North of Snake #1) and (6, 8) (North-West).\nSnake #1 will likely chase (8, 7) or (6, 8).\nI am safe from Snake #1 for now.\n\nChoosing **UP** aligns me with the column 3 apples and is the shortest path to the nearest apple at (3, 6).\n\nPlan: Move UP to (3, 5). Next turn, move UP to (3, 6) to eat the apple. Watch for Snake #1 moving towards (8, 7) or (6, 8). Avoid getting trapped in the top-left corner.\n\nUP",

So previous turn I was at (3, 6) and moved UP to (3, 7).\n    *   Current target: (3, 8). Is it safe?\n    *   Board row 8: `. . A . . . A . 1 .`\n    *   (3, 8) is empty (represented by a dot).\n    *   Is it an enemy body? Snake 1 is at (8,8), (8,7), (8,6). So (3,8) is safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 6):** My own body (Neck). **DEADLY.**\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 7):** Empty. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 7):** Empty. Safe.\n\n**Strategy & Planning:**\n*   **Immediate Safety:** Avoid DOWN.\n*   **Apple Access:**\n    *   Up (3,8) -> Leads to Apple (3,9) next turn. Distance 1 to Apple (3,9).\n    *   Left (2,7) -> Leads to Apple (2,8). Distance 2.\n    *   Right (4,7) -> Leads to Apple (4,5). Distance 2 (Down 1, Right 1) OR Apple (6,7). Distance 2 (Right 2).\n*   **Enemy Analysis:**\n    *   Snake 1 is at (8,8). It is far right. It likely targets (6,8) or (6,7).\n    *   If I go UP, I secure the top-left apple (3,9). It's isolated.\n    *   If I go RIGHT, I enter the central column where apples (4,5) and (6,7) are. This puts me in potential conflict with Snake 1 if it moves West.\n*   **Long Term:**\n    *   Snakes move simultaneously.\n    *   If I go UP to (3, 8), I am one step away from eating (3, 9). Eating (3, 9) will grow me. My tail will stay at (3, 5) until I eat.\n    *   If I go UP, I am \"claiming\" the top-left corner.\n    *   If I go RIGHT, I am \"sharing\" the middle.\n    *   Given that I am currently at (3, 7), moving UP to (3, 8) is the fastest path to an apple (3, 9) without crossing the center board where the enemy is likely to be.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMove UP to secure the apple at (3,9) efficiently and safely.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Moving up keeps us alive, and we are closer to apple at (6,8) in a few moves.\n- MOVE RIGHT to (9,8): within bounds and free. Slightly to the right, no immediate threat.\n- MOVE LEFT to (7,8): within bounds and free. Moving left would take us away from the central cluster.\n- MOVE DOWN to (8,7): occupied by our body \u2014 dangerous.\n\nMoving down is invalid; moving into our own body.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT:\n\n- Moving UP to (8,9): directly under the top boundary, no immediate risk, can navigate toward apples in that direction.\n- Moving RIGHT to (9,8): also safe but farther from the closest apples.\n\nOur current goal is to stay alive, consider the proximity of apples, especially tied to moving upward toward the apple at (6,8). Moving up now positions us better for reaching that apple next turn.\n\nFuture risks:\n\n- Moving UP maintains a safe path. The enemy head at (3,8) is far away, so no immediate attack.\n- Moving UP also keeps options open for further movement, and no obstacles ahead.\n- Moving right pushes us toward the right edge without immediate benefit.\n\nTherefore, the safest and most strategic move now is UP.\n\n**Decision: UP**\n\nUP",

T . . . . . .` -> My tail at (3,6).\n\n**Move Evaluation (From Head at 3, 8):**\n1.  **UP to (3, 9):**\n    *   **Safety:** Check Board Row 9 at x=3. It is an Apple (`A`). No snake bodies. Safe.\n    *   **Value:** Moves directly onto an apple. This will grow my snake by 1. My tail will not move this turn, creating a longer body for future safety/obstacle.\n    *   **Outcome:** I eat (3,9). My new head is (3,9). Length becomes 4.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 7):**\n    *   **Safety:** My own body (Neck). **DEADLY.**\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Check Board Row 8 at x=2. It is an Apple (`A`). Safe.\n    *   **Value:** Moves onto an apple. I would eat (2,8). Length becomes 4.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 8):**\n    *   **Safety:** Check Board Row 8 at x=4. It is empty (`.`). Safe.\n    *   **Value:** Moves closer to center apples but does not eat immediately.\n\n**Strategy:**\n*   **Immediate Gain:** Both UP and LEFT allow me to eat an apple immediately. Eating is usually the best option to grow and secure points.\n*   **Positioning:**\n    *   UP places me at (3,9), top-left corner. This isolates me from the center apples where the enemy was (and died). It gives me a safe buffer zone.\n    *   LEFT places me at (2,8), also top-left. It is valid, but UP puts me at (3,9) which is an isolated corner apple.\n    *   Since the enemy (Snake 1) died at (8,9) this turn (trying to move off the board), the center apples ((6,8), (6,7), (4,5)) are now unguarded.\n*   **Decision:** Moving UP secures the (3,9) apple safely and efficiently. It is a guaranteed point and growth. I am currently at (3,8), so (3,9) is directly in front.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nSecure the top-left apple at (3,9). Since Snake 1 died, I have free reign over the board. After eating, I will likely be at (3,9) with a length of 4. I will then look to pivot towards the center apples ((6,8), (4,5), etc.) to maximize my score before turn 150. My tail will stay at (3,6) this turn, which might block the path back down, so heading towards the center via (4,9) or (3,8) (post-turn) might be necessary, but getting the apple first is priority.\n\nUP",
