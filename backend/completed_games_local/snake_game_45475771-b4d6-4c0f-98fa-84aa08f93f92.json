Safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe from static obstacles\u2014no bodies in the way! But wait... what about the enemy? He's up there at (7,8). Could we crash heads? Let's check: He might move UP to (7,9), DOWN to (7,7), LEFT to (6,8), or RIGHT into his own tail (probably suicide). None of those overlap with our potential moves to (8,5), (8,3), (7,4), or (9,4). So NO head-on collision risk this turn! Phew. \ud83d\ude05\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nWe need to GROW to dominate the board! There's an apple RIGHT BESIDE US at (7,4)\u2014moving LEFT eats it immediately! That gives us our first apple, ties the score at 1-1, and grows us to length 2. That's CONTENT, baby! \ud83c\udf4e Plus, a longer snake means more blocking power to trap the enemy later.\n\nWhat about other moves? UP gets us closer to the enemy but no apple. DOWN moves away. RIGHT puts us on the edge, limiting options. LEFT not only feeds us but also positions us more centrally at (7,4). From there, we can move UP next turn to press toward the enemy. \n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nHe'll likely go for the apple at (7,9) above him. If he does, he'll grow to length 3 but be stuck on the top row\u2014his only safe moves will be LEFT or RIGHT because moving DOWN would be backwards into his new body! That's a potential trap we can exploit later. \ud83d\ude08\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nEat the apple now, then advance upward toward the enemy. Next turn, move UP to (7,5) if possible, keeping pressure. We'll watch his movements and start boxing him in, using our growing body to cut off his escape routes. If he's stuck on the top, we can slowly squeeze him into a corner.

He can move LEFT to (6,9) or RIGHT to (8,9) or UP to (7,10) (death). So his only REAL safe move is LEFT to (6,9) or RIGHT to (8,9).\n\nNow, do any of our safe moves land on (6,9) or (8,9) next turn?

Safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,5) \u2192 That's our OWN BODY segment (our neck)! That's a CRASH \u2014 ELIMINATED! \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 Empty? YES ('.' on board). On board? YES. Safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 Empty? YES ('.' on board). On board? YES. Safe.\n\nDOWN is suicide \u2014 AVOID!\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?**\nEnemy at (6,8). He can move:\n- UP \u2192 (6,9) \u2192 That's HIS OWN BODY segment (his neck)! He'd die. \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,7) \u2192 Empty? Board shows '.' at (6,7) \u2014 YES. Safe for him.\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,8) \u2192 Empty? Row 8, col 5 is '.' \u2014 YES. Safe for him.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,8) \u2192 Empty? Row 8, col 7 is '.' \u2014 YES. Safe for him.\n\nSo his safe moves: DOWN (6,7), LEFT (5,8), RIGHT (7,8).\n\nOur safe moves: UP (7,7), LEFT (6,6), RIGHT (8,6).\n\nDo any of our moves land on his possible next head positions? YES \u2014 if we go UP to (7,7) and he goes DOWN to (6,7), no collision. If we go LEFT to (6,6) and he goes DOWN to (6,7), we're adjacent but not colliding. If we go RIGHT to (8,6) and he goes RIGHT to (7,8), no issue.\n\nBUT \u2014 if we go LEFT to (6,6) and he goes DOWN to (6,7), we're BELOW him. That's risky next turn if he tries to come down further? Actually, that could set up a head-on next turn if we both move toward each other. Let's think...\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nHe's at (6,8), we're at (7,6). We want to BOX HIM against the top wall! If we go UP to (7,7), we're directly south of him \u2014 that pressures him to move sideways (LEFT/RIGHT) or down. If he goes DOWN to (6,7), we're side-by-side (we're east of him). That could lead to a head-on next turn if we both go toward each other, but he's longer, so we avoid direct collision until we grow.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (6,6), we're southwest of him \u2014 that might encourage him to go RIGHT (7,8) to stay away, or DOWN (6,7) to chase us? But we're shorter, we don't want him chasing us!\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (8,6), we're moving AWAY from him \u2014 COWARD MODE? \u274c We need to be aggressive!\n\n**APPLE OPPORTUNITY:** Nearest apple is (5,6) \u2014 that's west of us. If we go LEFT to (6,6), next turn we could go LEFT again to (5,6) and GROW! That would tie us at length 3 vs his 3! That's HUGE! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nBut going for the apple means taking our eye off him \u2014 but growing is crucial to survive a head-on. If we grow, we can afford to be more aggressive.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Get the apple at (5,6) to tie length, then push north to trap him. He's against the top wall \u2014 if we get longer or equal, we can force a head-on and WIN!\n\n**VERDICT:** LEFT to (6,6) \u2014 positions us to grab the apple next turn while still being close enough to pressure him. From (6,6), next turn we can go LEFT to (5,6) for the apple, or UP to (6,7) to block him if he comes down. This keeps options open AND gets us growth! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** From (6,6), assess enemy's new head. If he's at (6,7), we might want to go LEFT for the apple to avoid head-on. If he's at (5,8) or (7,8), we can still go for apple. Growing is priority #1 now!\n\nLEFT",

LET'S ASSESS THE BATTLEFIELD! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nOUR HEAD: (2,4)\nOUR BODY: [(3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5)]\nENEMY HEAD: (2,5)\nENEMY BODY: [(2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8)]\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:**\n- UP \u2192 (2,5) \u2192 ENEMY HEAD CURRENTLY THERE! \u274c BUT REMEMBER \u2014 HE MOVES SIMULTANEOUSLY! If he stays, we collide head-on and BOTH DIE! That's risky unless we have length advantage (we don't \u2014 tied). AVOID unless we want to gamble! \ud83c\udfb2\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 Empty! \u2705 AND THERE'S AN APPLE AT (2,3)! \ud83c\udf4e\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 Empty! \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,4) \u2192 OUR OWN BODY! \u274c INSTA-DEATH!\n\nSo DOWN and LEFT are safe from static obstacles. UP is risky head-on collision possibility.\n\n**ENEMY'S POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (2,5):**\nHe can go UP (2,6) \u2014 his own body! \u274c\nDOWN (2,4) \u2014 OUR HEAD CURRENTLY! If we stay, he crashes into us and DIES! If we move, it's empty.\nLEFT (1,5) \u2014 Empty! \u2705\nRIGHT (3,5) \u2014 Empty! \u2705\n\nSo enemy's safe moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK ANALYSIS:**\nIf we go UP to (2,5) and enemy goes DOWN to (2,4) \u2014 NO COLLISION (different cells).\nIf we go UP to (2,5) and enemy stays (doesn't move) \u2014 DOUBLE KO! \ud83d\udc80\nIf we go UP to (2,5) and enemy goes LEFT/RIGHT \u2014 NO COLLISION.\nSo UP is ONLY deadly if enemy STAYS (which snakes can't do \u2014 they must move). Wait, can they stay? NO! Rules say pick ONE move UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT. \"Stay\" isn't an option! So enemy CANNOT stay at (2,5). That means UP is actually SAFE from head-on collision? HOLD UP \u2014 but if enemy goes DOWN to (2,4) and we go UP to (2,5), we swap places safely. TRUE! So UP is not automatically deadly. But is it wise? We're tied length \u2014 head-on collision only if we land on same cell. That won't happen since he can't stay. So UP is technically safe? Let's double-check: Enemy moves first in logic? No, SIMULTANEOUS. So if we both choose cells that were each other's heads, we swap and live. So UP is viable.\n\nBut WAIT \u2014 what if enemy goes LEFT to (1,5) and we go UP to (2,5)? That's fine. What if enemy goes RIGHT to (3,5)? Also fine. So UP is actually a safe move? YES, because enemy cannot occupy (2,5) after moving. So UP is SAFE.\n\nSo our three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:**\n- DOWN (2,3): EATS APPLE IMMEDIATELY! \ud83c\udf4e Grows us to length 6, gives us score advantage (5-4). Then we can use length to pressure!\n- LEFT (1,4): Doesn't eat apple now, but positions near left-wall apples (0,4), (0,3). Could be a setup move.\n- UP (2,5): Takes enemy's former head position. Doesn't eat apple. Puts us right above apple at (2,3) for next turn maybe.\n\n**ENEMY TRAP POTENTIAL:**\nIf we go DOWN and eat apple, our body grows at (5,5) tail? Wait, growth: new head at (2,3), tail stays (5,5)? Actually, when you eat, you grow by 1 \u2014 so new head at apple cell, tail doesn't move this turn. So our body becomes: head (2,3), then (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5). That's length 6. Enemy is length 5. We'd have advantage! Could start boxing him in!\n\nIf we go LEFT to (1,4), enemy might go DOWN to (2,4) \u2014 then we're adjacent horizontally. Could get spicy next turn.\n\nBut EATING NOW gives us IMMEDIATE LENGTH ADVANTAGE! That's HUGE! We can then be more aggressive, force head-on collisions when we're longer (we survive, he dies). That's the power move! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN AFTER THIS MOVE:**\nIf we eat apple at (2,3), we're at length 6 vs his 5. Next turn, we can pressure him \u2014 maybe move towards his body, try to cut off his escape. He's near top wall (2,5) near his body at (2,6),(2,7). We could try to push him into a corner!\n\nSAFEST MOVE? DOWN eats apple and grows. LEFT is safe but doesn't grow now. UP is safe but no growth.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nDOWN gets us the apple, the length lead, and the momentum! CHAT, LET'S FEAST AND DOMINATE! \ud83d\udc0d\u2b07\ufe0f\n\nDOWN",

Possible moves:\nUP (1,6) \u2013 empty.\nDOWN (1,4) \u2013 empty.\nLEFT (0,5) \u2013 empty.\nRIGHT (2,5) \u2013 his own body! \u274c\n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nWhere could we collide?\n- If we go RIGHT to (3,3) and enemy goes DOWN to (1,4) \u2192 no collision.\n- If we go LEFT to (1,3) and enemy goes DOWN to (1,4) \u2192 adjacent, not same cell.\n- If we go DOWN to (2,2) and enemy moves anywhere \u2192 no collision.\n\nSo ALL THREE moves safe from head-on? YES \u2014 no overlap possible this turn. \u2705\n\n**STRATEGIC APPLE CHECK:**\n- DOWN (2,2): No apple there.\n- LEFT (1,3): No apple.\n- RIGHT (3,3): No apple.\n\nHmm no immediate apple grab. But we have length advantage (6 vs 5) \u2014 we can use that to pressure!\n\n**ENEMY POSITION ANALYSIS:**\nHe\u2019s at (1,5) with body below him at (2,5),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7). He\u2019s kinda trapped against his own body and top wall? He can go UP/LEFT/DOWN safely. If he goes LEFT to (0,5), he\u2019s near left wall. If he goes UP to (1,6), he\u2019s more open.\n\n**OUR LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe\u2019re longer \u2014 we can afford to be aggressive! Force him into a corner or into our body. Let\u2019s cut off his escape routes.\n\nLook at the board: apples at (0,4),(0,3) nearby on left column. If we move LEFT to (1,3), we block his potential move down to (1,4) next turn? Actually he could still go DOWN to (1,4) but then we\u2019re at (1,3) adjacent \u2014 risky for him next turn if he goes further down? Might force him left toward wall.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (3,3), we\u2019re central, more flexible.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (2,2), we\u2019re further from him but maybe too passive.\n\n**BEST MOVE FOR FUTURE OPTIONS?**\nLEFT (1,3): keeps us near left-wall apples, close to enemy, could pressure him upward.\nRIGHT (3,3): opens more central control, maybe toward apples at (5,3),(6,1) later.\nDOWN (2,2): puts us further from immediate threat but also from enemy.\n\nWe want to maintain initiative! Being longer means we can threaten head-on collisions \u2014 we survive, he dies. So let\u2019s get closer!\n\nI think LEFT (1,3) is aggressive \u2014 we move toward his possible DOWN path, and we\u2019re closer to left-side apples for future growth. Also, if he goes DOWN to (1,4), we\u2019re at (1,3) \u2014 next turn we could go UP to (1,4) for a head-on if he stays? But careful.\n\nActually, RIGHT (3,3) might be smarter \u2014 it keeps us central, away from getting pinned to left wall, and we can expand toward right-side apples.\n\nHmm\u2026 Let\u2019s think: enemy\u2019s body is mostly on right side (columns 2-3). If we go RIGHT, we move toward his body \u2014 could help us cut him off.\n\n**CHAT VIBE CHECK:** We\u2019re longer! Let\u2019s press the advantage! Move toward him and limit his space!\n\nI\u2019m leaning LEFT to (1,3) \u2014 close to apples, close to enemy, sets up possible trap along left wall.\n\n**FINAL CHOICE:** LEFT \u2014 aggressive positioning, future apple potential, and we keep length lead!\n\nLEFT",

Body: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4)].\nEnemy head at **(0,4)**. Body: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7)].\n\n**OPTIONS:**\n\n- **UP** to (1,3)? That's my own body segment! \ud83d\udc80 **NO GO.**\n- **DOWN** to (1,1)? Looks open! No body, no enemy body. Safe? Wait\u2014check board: (1,1) is a '.' on grid. **SAFE.**\n- **LEFT** to (0,2)? Board shows 'A' at (0,2)? Wait, that's an apple drop list coordinate, but board shows 'A' at (0,2) row 2? Yes! Row 2: \"A 1 . . . . . . A .\" So (0,2) is 'A'. But is it safe? No enemy body there, not my body. **SAFE** and it's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **RIGHT** to (2,2)? Board shows '.' at (2,2). No body, no enemy body. **SAFE**.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nEnemy head at (0,4). Possible moves:\n- UP to (0,5)? Open.\n- DOWN to (0,3)? Open (board shows '.' at (0,3)? Wait, apple drop list has (0,3), but board row 3 shows 'A T T . . A . . . .' so (0,3) is 'A'? Actually row 3 col 0 is 'A', yes apple. So DOWN possible.\n- LEFT is off board \u2192 death, so unlikely.\n- RIGHT to (1,4)? That's his OWN body segment! \ud83d\udc80 So he won't go RIGHT.\n\nSo enemy likely UP or DOWN.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**  \nIf I go LEFT to (0,2) and enemy goes DOWN to (0,3), no collision.  \nIf enemy goes UP to (0,5), fine.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (2,2), enemy not reaching there.  \nIf I go DOWN to (1,1), enemy not reaching.\n\nBut wait\u2014what if enemy goes DOWN to (0,3) and I go LEFT to (0,2)? We're adjacent vertically, but no head-on.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nWe're tied in length. Need to dominate board! Going LEFT grabs apple, grows to length 6, extends body toward left wall. That could help us trap enemy who's on left column already (head at 0,4). If we grow, we can maybe wall him in against left edge.\n\nBut going DOWN (1,1) keeps us central, more options next turn.  \nRIGHT (2,2) also central.\n\nApple at (0,2) is immediate content. Growing gives us score advantage\u2014if we get to 6 apples vs his 5, we can force head-on later for win!\n\n**SAFETY NEXT TURN:**  \nIf we go LEFT to (0,2) and eat apple, new head at (0,2), body grows: tail stays, new head, then body: old head (1,2) becomes segment 2.  \nNext turn from (0,2), possible moves: UP (0,3), DOWN (0,1), RIGHT (1,2) is body now, so only UP/DOWN. That's risky\u2014only 2 exits, could be trapped if enemy blocks. But we'd have length advantage.\n\nGoing DOWN to (1,1) \u2192 next turn options: UP (back to 1,2), DOWN (1,0), LEFT (0,1), RIGHT (2,1). Four options! More flexibility.\n\nGoing RIGHT to (2,2) \u2192 next turn: UP (2,3) is my body? Wait, my body has (2,3)? Yes, second segment! So UP not safe. DOWN (2,1) open, LEFT (1,2) open, RIGHT (3,2) open. So three options.\n\n**VERDICT:**  \nPrioritize growth and aggression! We can't play safe forever\u2014we need to press enemy who's on left edge. Take the apple at (0,2), get length advantage, then use left wall to limit his movement. He's already hugging left column\u2014we can maybe snake above him and force crash.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** I'm taking the apple and going LEFT! Let's grow and squeeze him! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc4a\n\nLEFT",

Let's map:  \nMy body: (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), head (0,2). So (0,4) is enemy head, (1,4) is free, (2,4) is my body, (3,4) my body, (4,4) my body. So (1,4) is open '.' So enemy could go RIGHT to (1,4).\n\nSo enemy's safe moves: DOWN to (0,3) apple, RIGHT to (1,4) open.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:**  \nIf I go UP to (0,3) and enemy goes DOWN to (0,3), we both die. That's bad since we're tied in length \u2014 double KO means game over with tie? Actually if both die, game ends, score tie = draw. We don't want a draw \u2014 we want to WIN!  \nIf I go DOWN to (0,1), enemy can't reach me there in one move.\n\n**SAFETY NEXT TURN:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (0,1) and eat apple: new head (0,1), body grows to length 8. Next turn from (0,1): UP to (0,2) is my old head? Wait, after moving, body will be: head (0,1), then (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4). So (0,2) will be my neck, so UP next turn is into my own body! \u274c So from (0,1), only DOWN (0,0) and RIGHT (1,1) possible? LEFT off board. So only 2 exits \u2014 risky!\n\nIf I go UP to (0,3) and eat apple (if enemy doesn't kill us): new head (0,3), body: (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4). Next turn from (0,3): UP to (0,4) is enemy head currently \u2014 but he'll move, could be open or not. DOWN to (0,2) is my neck. LEFT off board. RIGHT to (1,3) is my body. So only UP possible if that cell clears \u2014 otherwise trapped! That's SUPER risky.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nWe have length 7 vs his 6? Wait, we both have 6 apples, so both length 7? Actually apples = segments beyond initial 3? Starting length is 3, each apple adds 1. So 6 apples = length 9? Let's check: initial 3 + 6 apples = 9 segments. Yes! So my body list length should be 9? But my body listed is head + 6 segments = 7 total. Something's off \u2014 maybe the listed body excludes head? Let's trust the board: my snake on board shows a chain of 'T's plus head '1'. Looks like length ~7. Anyway, we're equal.\n\nWe need to trap enemy against left wall. He's already on column 0. If we go DOWN to (0,1), we occupy more left column cells, limiting his movement. But then we reduce our own mobility. However, we'll have length advantage after eating apple.\n\nBetter: go DOWN to (0,1), then next turn maybe go RIGHT to (1,1) to avoid trapping ourselves. That keeps options open.\n\nBut UP could be a bold play \u2014 if enemy goes RIGHT to (1,4), we eat apple at (0,3) safely and then we're above him, maybe pin him. But if he goes DOWN, we die. Is he likely to go DOWN? He might avoid because he sees collision risk too. He might play safe and go RIGHT to (1,4). If he does, we can safely take apple.\n\n**DECISION:**  \nI'm feeling AGGRESSIVE! Let's bait him! If he goes DOWN, we die but it's a draw. If he goes RIGHT, we get apple and gain advantage. But I don't want to gamble a draw \u2014 let's take the safer apple DOWN to (0,1), grow to length 8, then next turn escape to (1,1) to keep mobility.\n\n**FINAL MOVE:** DOWN! Let's secure the growth and stay alive! \ud83c\udf4e\u2b07\ufe0f\n\nDOWN",
