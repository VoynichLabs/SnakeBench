Moving up is safe. It positions us further from the current apple at (4,6), not advancing towards the nearby apple directly to the right, but it keeps us in a safe open space with more potential future options.\n\n- **DOWN (4,5):** Empty and safe, but moving down moves us away from the immediate apple at (4,6). Not ideal for immediate gain but safe.\n\n- **LEFT (3,6):** Moving into (3,6) is our current head's position. Moving left would lead us into our neck segment at (3,6), which would be self-collision. So, left is invalid.\n\n- **RIGHT (5,6):** Moving into (5,6), which currently is free, as we are at (4,6), and no snake occupies this cell. But earlier in the map, the apple is at (5,5), which is below (5,6), so moving right puts us closer to (5,5), which is advantageous. Also, there is an apple at (5,5)\u2014so moving right is beneficial. But we need to verify that moving right into (5,6) isn't risky or trapping us:\n\n  - Is (5,6) occupied? Our snake's body is at (3,6), (2,6), (2,7), and our tail is at (2,7). Current position (4,6). So (5,6) is unoccupied.\n\n  - Will we be safe after moving right? The cells ahead from (5,6) are open, and moving towards the apple at (5,5) makes sense.\n\nAdditionally, note that the enemy's head at (8, 4), their body at (8,3), (9,3), (9,2), so no immediate threat in the right direction.\n\nConsidering safety and strategy, moving RIGHT offers a quick way to reach an apple, keeps us in the open space, and avoids immediate traps or collision risks.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT seems to be the strongest choice for immediate benefit and safety.\n\n---\n\n**Final decision:**\n\nRIGHT",

Given the position, moving down is also safe \u2014 there are no snakes in that direction, and it's an open space.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moving to (4,6), which is part of our body. This would result in self-collision, so it's invalid.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moving to (6,6). This position is free, but it's farther from the immediate apple at (5,5). Moving right would allow us to start moving towards other apples (like at (6,3) or (7,3)), but immediate benefit is less than moving down to get the apple directly below.\n\nConsidering all factors:\n- Moving **DOWN** immediately yields an apple, advancing our score.\n- Moving **UP** keeps options open and avoids quick collision, but delays apple intake.\n- Moving **RIGHT** is safe but less immediate and more long-term.\n- Moving **LEFT** is invalid.\n\nBetween moving **DOWN** and **UP**, the direct benefit of consuming the apple at (5,5) makes moving **DOWN** the best move.

Moving into our own body would result in death. Not safe.\n- Moving DOWN to (5,3): The cell (5,3) is free. Moving down moves us closer to the apple at (5,2), which is good for immediate goal.\n- Moving LEFT to (4,4): The cell (4,4) appears free. While this doesn't bring us closer to an apple now, it might be a safe lateral move, but risky as it could limit future options.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,4): The cell (6,4) is free but considering the position, moving right looks toward the enemy's body area, and the snake at (6,4) is the enemy's head \u2014 wait, the enemy head is at (6,4). So moving RIGHT would move into the enemy's head cell, which could cause us to die if they also move into our cell or result in head-on collision. However, note that the enemy's head is at (6,4). We can't move into their head directly; doing so would be moving into their cell, which is dangerous because if they move forward while we also attempt to do the same, we risk head-on collision.\n\nFrom the above:\n\n- Moving UP: unsafe (own body).\n- Moving DOWN: safe, moves us closer to (5,2). Good for immediate apple.\n- Moving LEFT: safe, but doesn't pursue immediate goals.\n- Moving RIGHT: unsafe, would collide with enemy head.\n\nGiven the objectives and safety:\n\n- Choosing DOWN is optimal as it advances us toward the nearest apple at (5,2), and it's safe.\n- Moving LEFT could be a fallback but doesn't help immediate goal.\n- Moving RIGHT is too risky.\n\nThus, I will proceed with **DOWN**.\n\nDOWN",
