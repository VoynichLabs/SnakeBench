Consider enemy snake positions**  \nSnake #1 head at (3, 6). Possible moves for Snake #1: UP (3, 7), DOWN (3, 5), LEFT (2, 6), RIGHT (4, 6).  \n\nIf I go UP to (4, 6), Snake #1 could also go RIGHT to (4, 6) \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 both die.

Currently, enemy is far: vertical distance 4.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n- **UP** (8,5) \u2014 closer to apple (8,8) and equally mobile next turn.  \n- **DOWN** (8,3) \u2014 apple (5,5) is closer in y-distance 2 vs x-distance 3, but still distant. (0,5) also possible long term \u2014 but puts me near bottom crowded by enemy maybe later.  \n- **LEFT** (7,4) \u2014 central position, good escape routes.  \n\n**Mobility after:**  \nFrom (8,5): Up \u2192 (8,6), Left \u2192 (7,5), Right \u2192 (9,5) \u2014 all likely safe unless enemy moves unpredictably \u2014 3 options next turn.  \nFrom (8,3): Up\u2192(8,4) body? No, (8,4) will be empty after I move; Down\u2192(8,2) body; Wait, check: My body after moving from (8,4): head to ?, tail follows.  \nActually, after moving UP from (8,4): body becomes [(9,4),(9,3),(9,2),(8,2)] \u2014 head at (8,5). So (8,4) becomes empty.  \n\nActually careful: My current body: head (8,4), then (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (8,2), length 5 segments. If I move without eating apple, tail stays same length, tail end moves to old neck (9,4)?  \n\nBetter to check immediate next-turn mobility quickly:  \n\nUP: (8,5) \u2192 next moves:  \n- UP (8,6) free  \n- DOWN (8,4) free (old head position will be free if tail grows from eating apple? no apple at (8,5) so tail doesn\u2019t grow, so tail moves from (8,2) to (9,4), freeing (8,2) and (9,4)? Wait logic:  \nMovement without apple: head moves forward, each segment moves into previous segment\u2019s position, last segment (tail) vacates its cell. Current body: [ (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2), (8,2) ]  \nAfter moving UP, new body: [ (8,5), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2) ], Tail was (8,2) \u2014 freed. Occupied cells: (8,5), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2)  \n\nSo from (8,5), DOWN goes to (8,4) \u2014 but that is occupied by my body segment! So invalid. So UP from (8,5) has: UP (8,6) free, LEFT (7,5) free, RIGHT (9,5) free. DOWN not possible. So 3 moves.  \n\nSimilarly, DOWN from (8,4) to (8,3): new body: [ (8,3), (8,4), (9,4), (9,3), (9,2) ] \u2014 tail (8,2) freed. From (8,3): Down (8,2) free (since tail moved), Up (8,4) body occupied, Left (7,3) free, Right (9,3) body occupied. So 2 moves.  \n\nLEFT from (8,4) to (7,4): new body: [ (7,4) (8,4),\n\nLEFT still solves at step\nLEFT: (7,4) (8,4)yes\n\nLEFT (7,4) (8,4) (9,4) (9,3) (). ( ) time to add. shapes with spaces.\n\nLEFT: (7,4),(8,4),(9,4),(9,3) \u2014 old tail? searching\n\nLEFT",

Possible moves:  \nUP (9,1) valid.  \nLEFT (8,0) \u2013 occupied by its own body (segment #2) \u2013 invalid if moving backward into neck.  \nDOWN invalid.  \nRIGHT invalid (x=10).  \n\nSo enemy will definitely go UP to (9,1) because it\u2019s the only safe move.  \n\nThus enemy not a nearby threat this turn.  \n\n**Project my moves:**  \n\n- **UP (7,5)**:  \n  New body: [(7,5),(7,4),(8,4),(9,4),(9,3)] \u2013 tail (9,2) freed.  \n  Next turn mobility from (7,5):  \n    UP (7,6) \u2013 free  \n    DOWN (7,4) \u2013 my body segment \u2013 no  \n    LEFT (6,5) \u2013 free  \n    RIGHT (8,5) \u2013 free \u2192 3 options.  \n  Long term: Close to apples (8,8) and others.  \n\n- **DOWN (7,3)**:  \n  Body: [(7,3),(7,4),(8,4),(9,4),(9,3)] \u2013 tail (9,2) freed.  \n  Next turn from (7,3):  \n    UP (7,4) my body \u2013 no  \n    DOWN (7,2) free  \n    LEFT (6,3) free  \n    RIGHT (8,3) free \u2192 3 options.  \n  But closer to apple (5,5) \u2013 might be worth it though enemy is far bottom-left.  \n\n- **LEFT (6,4)**:  \n  Body: [(6,4),(7,4),(8,4),(9,4),(9,3)] \u2013 tail (9,2) freed.  \n  Next turn from (6,4):  \n    UP (6,5) free  \n    DOWN (6,3) free  \n    LEFT (5,4) free  \n    RIGHT (7,4) body \u2013 no \u2192 3 options.  \n\nAll options have 3 moves next turn.  \n\n**Apple distances:**  \n- Nearest: (5,5) is 2 moves from (7,5) or (7,3) or (6,4), but more direct from (7,5) then UP LEFT etc. Possibly similar.  \n*(0,5) and (8,8)* also.  \n\nBut apple (5,5) is nearest to me now: Manhattan distance:  \nFrom (7,4) to (5,5): |7-5| + |4-5| = 2+1=3  \nFrom (7,4) to (8,8): 1+4=5  \nFrom (7,4) to (0,5): 7+1=8  \n\nSo (5,5) is closest.

Also LEFT puts me closer to enemy in long route but not immediate danger.  \nSnake #1 at (9,0) moving to (9,1) \u2013 still far.  \n\nI think UP is best because it opens path toward (8,8) as well as (5,5), keeping options.  \n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7,5), decide based on whether to approach (5,5) or (8,8).  \n\n**Final choice:**  \n\nUP",

Let me analyze the situation:\n\nCurrent board state:\n- Apples at: (8, 8), (0, 9), (5, 5), (0, 5), (5, 9)\n- My snake head at: (8, 1)\n- My snake body at: [(9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0)]\n- Enemy snake head at: (6, 5)\n- Enemy snake body at: [(7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4)]\n\nAll possible moves need to be evaluated for safety:\n1. UP: Moves to (8, 2) - Safe move, within board boundaries\n2. DOWN: Moves to (8, 0) - This would put my head into my own body (would cause immediate death)\n3. LEFT: Moves to (7, 1) - Safe move, within board boundaries\n4. RIGHT: Moves to (9, 1) - Safe move, within board boundaries\n\nEliminating the dangerous moves:\n- DOWN is eliminated as it would move into my own body\n\nAmong the remaining safe moves, I have three options:\n- UP to (8, 2): This gets me closer to the apple at (8, 8)\n- LEFT to (7, 1): This gets me closer to the apples at (5, 5) and (5, 9)\n- RIGHT to (9, 1): This gets me closer to the apple at (8, 8)\n\nI need to consider which move is better:\n- Moving UP or RIGHT gets me closer to the apple at (8, 8)\n- Moving LEFT gets me closer to the apples at (5, 5) and (5, 9)\n\nSince I have a slight disadvantage in apples (3 vs 4), I should prioritize getting to an apple. The apple at (8, 8) is closer than the apples at (5, 5) and (5, 9). Between UP and RIGHT, RIGHT keeps me closer to the apple at (8, 8) while also keeping my options open.\n\nI'll choose RIGHT to move to (9, 1) as it gets me closer to the apple at (8, 8) while maintaining safety and future flexibility.\n\nRIGHT",

Neck is (9, 1), so DOWN is (8,0) \u2014 that\u2019s body segment #3? Wait: enemy body: [(9,1), (9,0), (8,0)] so neck is (9,1) \u2192 DOWN (8,0) is not neck but is body segment #3 \u2192 invalid. So enemy moves: UP (8, 2), LEFT (7, 1).  \n   - Enemy cannot reach (6,6) in one move. \u2705 safe.\n\n2. **DOWN** (6, 4) \u2014 empty.  \n   - Enemy can\u2019t reach (6,4) in one move. \u2705 safe.\n\n3. **LEFT** (5, 5) \u2014 contains apple!  \n   - Enemy can\u2019t reach (5,5) in one move. \u2705 safe.  \n   - Eating apple grows me to length 6.\n\n4. **RIGHT** (7, 5) \u2014 my own body segment #2 \u2192 unsafe \u274c.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \n- LEFT (5, 5) gets apple immediately.  \n- UP (6, 6) moves toward apple (5, 9) or (8, 8) but not directly.  \n- DOWN (6, 4) moves away from most apples.\n\n**Future mobility:**  \nFrom (5, 5) after eating apple:  \n- Body becomes: head (5, 5), then (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4).  \n- Possible moves from (5, 5): UP (5, 6), DOWN (5, 4), LEFT (4, 5), RIGHT (6, 5) into body? Yes, (6,5) will be my neck, so RIGHT invalid. So 3 moves likely safe next turn if no enemy interference.  \n\nFrom (6, 6): likely 3 moves.  \nFrom (6, 4): likely 3 moves.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy position:**  \nEnemy at (8, 1) likely heading up toward apples (8, 8) or (5, 9).  \nIf I eat (5, 5) now, I\u2019m closer to (0, 5) next or can go up toward (0, 9) or (5, 9).  \nEating apple also increases my lead (5 vs 3 apples) and gives collision advantage.\n\n---\n\n**Best choice:**  \nLEFT to (5, 5) for immediate apple, safe, and maintains options.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating (5,5), consider going UP toward (5,9) or (0,9) while avoiding enemy path. Keep enemy\u2019s possible moves in mind \u2014 they may go (8,1)\u2192(8,2)\u2192... toward top apples. I can take left side apples and control space.\n\nLEFT",
