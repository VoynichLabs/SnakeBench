Empty space currently. Safe unless enemy moves there? Enemy is far away at (7,1) so unlikely to reach (7,9) this turn. Safe.  \n- **DOWN (to (7,7))**: Within board, no snake body there, no apple. Safe.  \n- **LEFT (to (6,8))**: Within board, empty, safe.  \n- **RIGHT (to (8,8))**: Within board, empty, safe.  \n\nAll 4 moves safe immediately. Now consider apples and future options.  \n\nClosest apple is at (1,7) \u2014 fairly far left. (6,3) and (8,4) are closest in steps. From (7,8):  \n- To (8,4): would need to go RIGHT then DOWN several steps.  \n- To (6,3): DOWN and LEFT several steps.  \n\nActually, (1,7) is 6 steps away (6 left, 1 down), but through the enemy zone later.  \n(8,4) is 4 steps away if we move RIGHT then DOWN (1 right, 4 down).  \n\nLet's think: If I go DOWN now to (7,7), I am closer to apple (8,4) or (6,3). But also path to (1,7) remains fine.  \n\nBut (8,4) and (9,4) are near each other \u2014 maybe the enemy will head there too from (7,1). Enemy's shortest apple is (6,3) or (8,4) \u2014 same distance for them.  \n\n**Head-on collision risk this turn?**  \nNo, enemy is too far away (7,1) to reach any cell I can reach in 1 move.  \n\nBest move now: Since I start near top, going DOWN opens more territory toward multiple apples. That seems better than going UP into an empty top row where only one apple is far away at (1,7) by a long route.  \n\nAlso, after moving once, my body will be at (7,8) so I must avoid that spot next turn.  \n\nCheck immediate rewards: No apple on immediate moves anyway \u2014 so all moves equal on that.  \n\nBetter to: Move toward center to keep options. DOWN moves toward center and two apples.  \n\n**Future safety**: After moving DOWN to (7,7), next turn avoid (7,8) my tail and possibly go LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN again. Good options remain.  \n\nLEFT to (6,8) also not bad, closer to apple (1,7). But that may lead along top \u2014 less central. I prefer central control early game.  \n\nDecision: **DOWN** seems optimal: moves toward apples, keeps flexibility, safe.  \n\nFinal choice:  \n\nDOWN",

So I can't collide with myself except possibly going backwards, which doesn't exist yet.  \nCheck each move:\n- UP \u2192 (8, 7): That cell has an apple 'A'! That means if I go up, I will eat it and grow my body to length 2. No snake body there, so safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 5): empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 6): empty, safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 6): empty (off board? No, 9,6 is valid; board is (0..9, 0..9)), safe.\n\nAll directions are safe (no body or wall collision possible).\n\n**Apple analysis:**\nApples at: (1,7), (9,4), (4,6), (8,4), (8,7).\nClosest: (8,7) directly above me: 1 step \u2192 UP.\nNext closest: (8,4) is 2 steps away (DOWN, DOWN).\n(9,4) is 3 steps (RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN).\nThe others far away.  \n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy #0 head at (6,3), body at (6,2). Likely enemy will try to eat (6,3)? No, apple (6,3) not listed in current apples \u2014 earlier maybe he ate it last turn? Actually current apples list is from present turn; (6,3) is not an apple now. Maybe I got confused \u2014 board shows no apple at (6,3). Yes: Board shows apple at (1,7), (9,4), (4,6), (8,4), (8,7) only. So the (6,3) apple is gone \u2014 enemy must have eaten it previously (they show 1 apple in score).  \nEnemy movement: They can move UP/LEFT/RIGHT from (6,3). UP (6,4) empty. RIGHT (7,3) empty. DOWN (6,2) is their own body (tail end?), maybe not safe? Wait, body is [(6,2)] \u2014 so (6,2) is occupied by their body segment, so DOWN is unsafe for them. Enemy's safe moves: LEFT (5,3), UP (6,4), RIGHT (7,3). They might head toward (4,6) apple (3 steps) or (8,4) (4 steps). But they are far from me.\n\n**Immediate decision:**\nThe apple at (8,7) is one step away \u2014 eating it gets me to 1 apple, ties enemy scores.  \nNo risk of head-on collision with enemy this turn \u2014 too far apart (8,6) vs (6,3).  \nTherefore, grabbing the closest apple is strategically good \u2014 gives me growth for future safety/options.  \nAfter eating apple at (8,7), next turn my body will be [(8,7), (8,6)] \u2014 tail at (8,6) will be behind me.\n\n**Potential future trap?**  \nAfter moving UP to (8,7), next turn my only unsafe move is DOWN into my new body segment at (8,6). So I'd have 3 safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. That\u2019s still flexible.  \n(8,7) is top row y=7 \u2014 above that y=8,9 are open? Wait, y=8 is row 8; 0\u20139 indexing, so max y=9. From (8,7): UP \u2192 (8,8) empty per board; that\u2019s fine. So no immediate trap.  \n\n**Plan:**\nEat closest apple at (8,7) now \u2192 gain apple, grow. Next turn assess from (8,7) toward apples (8,4) or (9,4) or (4,6). Avoid enemy path.  \n\nUP\n\n**NEXT RATIONALE**  \nAte apple (8,7), grew to length 2. Next turn avoid DOWN into my new tail at (8,6). Apples left: (1,7), (9,4), (4,6), (8,4). Enemy at (6,3) likely heading toward (4,6). Consider going RIGHT then DOWN toward (9,4) or (8,4) \u2014 safer path away from enemy. Keep options open.  \n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

There are 5 apples on the board at positions: (1, 7), (4, 6), (3, 9), (2, 3), and (6, 8).\n\n## Current Position and Apple Proximity\nI'm now at (9, 4) with my body at (8, 4), (7, 4), and (7, 3). I need to decide my next move to continue growing and positioning myself strategically.\n\n## Possible Moves and Safety\nI need to evaluate which move:\n1. Gets me closer to apples\n2. Maintains flexibility for future moves\n3. Avoids potential future conflicts\n\n## Move Analysis\nLooking at the four possible directions:\n- UP: Move to (9, 5) - This puts me adjacent to the enemy snake's head, creating a potential head-on collision risk\n- DOWN: Move to (9, 3) - This is a safe move away from the enemy\n- LEFT: Move to (8, 4) - This would move me back into my own body, killing me\n- RIGHT: Move to (10, 4) - This would move me off the board, killing me\n\n## Apple Proximity Analysis\nThe closest apples to my current position are:\n- (2, 3): 1 cell away (left) - but I can't move left as it would put me into my own body\n- (4, 6): 3 cells away (left and up)\n- (6, 8): 5 cells away (left and up)\n- (3, 9): 6 cells away (left and up)\n- (1, 7): 8 cells away (left and up)\n\n## Enemy Snake Analysis\nThe enemy snake is at (9, 5) with its body at (9, 6).

This move:\n- Keeps me safe from the enemy snake\n- Maintains flexibility for future moves\n- Positions me at the bottom-right corner of the board\n- Avoids the risk of head-on collision\n- Allows me to consider moving left toward the apple at (2, 3) in subsequent turns\n\nDOWN\nDOWN",

Wait \u2014 their head on board diagram is at (9,4), mine at (9,5).\n\n**Safety check:**\n- UP \u2192 (9,6): my body \u2014 unsafe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,4): enemy head currently at (9,4) \u2014 if we both move and enemy vacates, collision risk?  \nActually, enemy\u2019s current head is at (9,4), body at (8,4), (7,4), (7,3).  \nIf enemy moves to UP (9,5) \u2192 that\u2019s my current head: head-on collision \u2192 both die!  \nIf enemy moves LEFT (8,4) \u2192 into its own body \u2192 unsafe for them.  \nIf enemy moves DOWN impossible (off board) \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT off board unsafe.  \nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is UP to (9,5).  \n\nSo if I go DOWN to (9,4) and enemy goes UP to (9,5), we swap heads safely \u2014 no collision because positions are different cells on same turn. But trap: next turn if I\u2019m at (9,4) enemy at (9,5), I can only go LEFT or RIGHT from (9,4) (UP hits enemy body not yet there? Wait, enemy\u2019s tail is at (7,3), so enemy body at (8,4) and (7,4) and (7,3). From (9,4) my moves: UP (9,5) is enemy head \u2192 immediate collision next turn if we both stay? Need to check: next turn if enemy goes DOWN back to (9,4) while I go UP to (9,5) \u2192 both die. Dangerous dance.  \nAlso: The enemy could instead choose unsafe moves because they have none safe? Wait \u2014 they must choose safe move or die. Enemy\u2019s safe moves:  \nFrom (9,4):  \n- UP (9,5) safe if my head is not there next turn.  \n- LEFT (8,4) unsafe because their body is there.  \n- DOWN off board \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT off board \u2192 death.  \nSo enemy\u2019s ONLY safe move is UP to (9,5).  \n\nSo both of us know they must move UP to (9,5). That means my DOWN to (9,4) is safe *this turn* since enemy is vacating it. But next turn I\u2019m at (9,4), they\u2019re at (9,5), I have moves LEFT (8,4) their body \u2014 unsafe, RIGHT off board \u2014 unsafe, UP (9,5) enemy head \u2014 head-on risk, DOWN off board \u2014 unsafe. So I\u2019d be trapped into possible suicide next turn unless I can force them to move away. Possibly they are longer (apples=3) and may choose to avoid head-on next turn if I go UP to meet them, but that\u2019s risky.\n\nCheck my other moves:  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,5): empty \u2014 safe. Next turn: UP (8,6), DOWN (8,4) enemy body \u2014 unsafe, LEFT (7,5), RIGHT (9,5) possibly enemy head but maybe not if they move away\u2026 Wait, they are forced to (9,5) this turn. So my LEFT now avoids immediate collision this turn and next turn from (8,5) I have at least UP and LEFT moves.\n\n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2014 unsafe.\n\nSo safe moves for me: DOWN and LEFT.\n\n**Choice:**  \nLEFT seems better because from (8,5) I keep options open and avoid the dangerous position next to enemy with no escape route.  \nDOWN to (9,4) leads to possible death next turn unless enemy chooses unsafe move (they won\u2019t).\n\nLEFT\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (8,5), check enemy position. Likely enemy at (9,5), giving chase? If so, avoid moving RIGHT unless necessary. Go toward center apples like (6,8) while avoiding head-on collisions since enemy is longer.\n\nLEFT",

From my head (8,8):\n- Going LEFT then UP (7,8, then 7,9, but that\u2019s not directly to apple) \u2014 actually, (6,8) is best reached via LEFT to (7,8), then LEFT again to (6,8) (but need to check safety next turn).  \n- Another route: UP to (8,9) then LEFT to (7,9) then DOWN to (7,8) etc. \u2014 longer.\nApple (3,9) is also close in steps but blocked by enemy path concerns. (6,8) is safest and nearest.\n\n**Path planning:**\nSince (6,8) is 2 steps away: One safe path is LEFT to (7,8), then LEFT again to (6,8) if safe next turn.\n\n**Enemy avoidance:**\nEnemy at (6,3) likely heading toward apple (4,6) or (2,3). They are far away (5 rows). Small chance they go UP toward (3,9), but the nearest apple to them is (2,3) or (4,6), both south/left for them \u2014 probably not immediate threat to upper apples.\n\n**Mobility after move:**\n- UP (8,9): from there, possible moves: LEFT (7,9), RIGHT (9,9), DOWN (8,8) (would be empty because body moved) \u2014 3 safe moves likely.\n- LEFT (7,8): from there: UP (7,9), DOWN (7,7), LEFT (6,8) \u2014 3 safe moves. Also gets me closer to apple (6,8) for next turn.\n- RIGHT (9,8): from there: UP (9,9), LEFT (8,8), DOWN (9,7) \u2014 but (9,7) is empty after we leave \u2014 actually 3 moves too. But takes me to edge.\n\nLEFT seems best because it progresses toward (6,8) apple while keeping options open.\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**\nEnemy is far; no risk this turn. Possible enemy might move toward center eventually, but far enough away.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLEFT puts me optimally for (6,8) apple next turn and keeps central mobility.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (7,8), if apple (6,8) still there and no enemy near, go LEFT. Otherwise, maneuver to (3,9) or (4,6) if possible, avoiding enemy.\n\n**END CURRENT RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Its possible safe moves are:\n- UP to (3, 7)\n- LEFT to (2, 8)\n- RIGHT to (4, 8)\n\n## Decision\nI'll move RIGHT to (4, 1). This move:\n- Keeps me safe from the enemy snake (which cannot reach this position this turn)\n- Moves me closer to the apple at (4, 6), which is the closest apple\n- Positions me to the right, potentially giving me a better path to multiple apples\n- Maintains flexibility for future moves\n\nRIGHT\nRIGHT",

Immediate safety check for each move from (4, 7):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (4, 8): That's my body segment \u2014 unsafe. \u274c  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (4, 6): That's an apple \u2014 safe (eating apple is safe unless enemy head also moves there). \u2705  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (3, 7): Empty \u2014 safe. \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (5, 7): That's my body segment \u2014 unsafe. \u274c  \n\nSo safe moves: **DOWN**, **LEFT**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy threat analysis:\n\nEnemy head at (4, 4). Possible moves for enemy:  \n- UP (4, 5) \u2014 empty  \n- DOWN (4, 3) \u2014 its own body segment \u2014 unsafe for enemy  \n- LEFT (3, 4) \u2014 empty  \n- RIGHT (5, 4) \u2014 empty  \n\nSo enemy could go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 6) to eat apple:  \n- Enemy could go UP to (4, 5), then next turn I'd be at (4, 6) and enemy at (4, 5) \u2014 enemy could move DOWN into my head next turn if I stay still. But I can move away after eating apple.  \n- Also, if enemy goes RIGHT (5, 4) or LEFT (3, 4), not an immediate threat.  \n\nNo risk of head-on collision this turn because enemy can't reach (4, 6) in one move from (4, 4).  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple proximity and future mobility:\n\n**DOWN (4, 6)** \u2014 eat apple, grow longer.  \nFrom (4, 6):  \n- UP (4, 7) \u2014 my body segment (old head position) \u2014 unsafe next turn.  \n- DOWN (4, 5) \u2014 empty.  \n- LEFT (3, 6) \u2014 empty.  \n- RIGHT (5, 6) \u2014 empty.  \n\nSo after eating apple, I\u2019d have 2 or 3 safe moves depending on enemy movement.  \n\n**LEFT (3, 7)** \u2014 no apple eaten.  \nFrom (3, 7):  \n- UP (3, 8) \u2014 my body segment \u2014 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (3, 6) \u2014 empty.  \n- LEFT (2, 7) \u2014 empty.  \n- RIGHT (4, 7) \u2014 my body segment \u2014 unsafe.  \n\nSo only 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\nEating apple now increases my score and length, but also reduces mobility slightly next turn because my body occupies more space. Still, eating apple gets me closer to winning (50 apples goal).  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Long-term planning:\n\nEnemy has 5 apples, I have 4. Need to catch up.  \nClosest apple is at (4, 6), so DOWN is direct.  \nAlso, apple at (1, 7) is reachable after that via LEFT moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN gets the apple and keeps me safe this turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating apple at (4, 6), move to (3, 6) or (5, 6) to avoid potential enemy threat from (4, 5), then head toward (1, 7) or (8, 6) depending on safety.  \n\nDOWN",

But enemy won\u2019t die unless it hits my body \u2014 but (4, 6) is empty, so enemy could go there safely. But if enemy goes to (4, 6) and I go to (4, 6) \u2014 impossible because I can\u2019t go DOWN into enemy head. So no head-on collision possible this turn except if we both go to same cell that\u2019s not my current head? Actually, head-on collision only happens if we both choose the same destination cell.  \n\nLet\u2019s check possible overlaps:  \nEnemy possible moves: UP (4, 6), DOWN (4, 4) \u2014 its own body, so enemy probably won\u2019t choose that unless forced, LEFT (3, 5), RIGHT (5, 5).  \n\nMy possible moves: LEFT (3, 6), RIGHT (5, 6).  \n\nNo overlap in destination cells between my safe moves and enemy\u2019s possible moves \u2192 no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple proximity and future mobility:\n\nApples: (3, 7) is close to LEFT path: from (3, 6) next turn, UP to (3, 7) gets apple.  \n(8, 6) is closer to RIGHT path: from (5, 6), then RIGHT toward (8, 6).  \n\nWhich is safer?  \n\n**LEFT (3, 6):**  \nFrom (3, 6):  \n- UP (3, 7) \u2014 apple, but check safety: enemy at (4, 5) could go LEFT (3, 5) then next turn UP to (3, 6)? Actually, if I go to (3, 6), enemy could go LEFT (3, 5) this turn, then next turn enemy at (3, 5) could go UP (3, 6) \u2014 but I\u2019d be at (3, 7) eating apple, so no collision. But enemy could also go UP this turn to (4, 6), then LEFT to (3, 6) next turn \u2014 but I\u2019d be gone. Seems safe.  \n\n**RIGHT (5, 6):**  \nFrom (5, 6):  \n- UP (5, 7) \u2014 my body \u274c  \n- DOWN (5, 5) \u2014 empty  \n- LEFT (4, 6) \u2014 my old position (empty now) but next turn? Actually, from (5, 6), LEFT goes to (4, 6) which is empty.  \n- RIGHT (6, 6) \u2014 empty  \n\nSo 3 safe moves next turn if RIGHT.  \n\nLEFT from (3, 6) next turn:  \nUP (3, 7) apple, DOWN (3, 5) \u2014 possible enemy? If enemy goes LEFT (3, 5) this turn, then (3, 5) is enemy head next turn \u2014 so DOWN from (3, 6) would be head-on collision next turn. So maybe LEFT is riskier next turn if enemy goes LEFT this turn.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Minimize risk:\n\nEnemy might go UP (4, 6) or LEFT (3, 5).  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (3, 5), then my going LEFT to (3, 6) puts me adjacent to enemy head \u2014 dangerous next turn because limited moves.  \n\nIf enemy goes UP to (4, 6), then my going RIGHT to (5, 6) is safe and far from enemy.  \n\nGiven enemy\u2019s tendency to chase apples: closest apple to enemy is (3, 7) \u2014 enemy might move toward it via LEFT (3, 5) then UP (3, 6), etc. So LEFT path for me might run into enemy.  \n\nRIGHT seems safer: more open space, path to apples (8, 6), (8, 9).  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** RIGHT \u2014 safer space, avoids potential enemy path toward (3, 7).  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (5, 6), move toward (8, 6) apple while keeping distance from enemy.  \n\nRIGHT",

Immediate safety check from (7, 6):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (7, 7): Empty \u2014 safe \u2705  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (7, 5): Empty \u2014 safe \u2705  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (6, 6): My body segment \u2014 unsafe \u274c  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8, 6): Apple \u2014 safe \u2705 (eating apple is safe)  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy threat analysis:\n\nEnemy head at (6, 4). Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP (6, 5) \u2014 empty  \n- DOWN (6, 3) \u2014 empty  \n- LEFT (5, 4) \u2014 its own body \u274c  \n- RIGHT (7, 4) \u2014 empty  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (7, 4), next turn it could threaten my DOWN position (7, 5) or my current position (7, 6) if I stay.  \nIf enemy goes UP to (6, 5), it\u2019s closer to my possible UP path.  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (6, 3), it\u2019s farther away.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple proximity and growth:\n\nClosest apple: (8, 6) \u2014 RIGHT. Eating it grows me by 1 segment.  \nOther apples: (8, 9) \u2014 3 steps away after eating (8, 6), (9, 3) \u2014 far, (3, 7) \u2014 blocked by my body, (1, 7) \u2014 far.\n\nRIGHT gets me an apple and moves me away from enemy\u2019s current position.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility after each move:\n\n- **RIGHT to (8, 6)** (apple):  \n  Next turn from (8, 6): possible moves UP (8, 7), DOWN (8, 5), LEFT (7, 6) (my old body \u2014 unsafe? Wait, next turn my body will be: head (8, 6), then old head (7, 6), then (6, 6), etc. So (7, 6) will be my neck \u2014 unsafe to go back LEFT). So next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Good options remain.\n\n- **UP to (7, 7)**:  \n  Next turn from (7, 7): possible moves UP (7, 8), DOWN (7, 6) (neck), LEFT (6, 7), RIGHT (8, 7). Three safe moves. But no apple immediate.\n\n- **DOWN to (7, 5)**:  \n  Next turn from (7, 5): UP (7, 6) neck, DOWN (7, 4), LEFT (6, 5), RIGHT (8, 5). Three safe moves. Risk: enemy could move RIGHT to (7, 4) this turn, then next turn enemy could go UP to (7, 5) for head-on collision if I\u2019m there. So DOWN is slightly risky.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Best choice:\n\nRIGHT gets apple, increases score, moves toward board edge but still has options next turn.  \nEnemy is at (6, 4) and can\u2019t reach (8, 6) in one move, so no head-on risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan for next turns after this:**  \nAfter eating (8, 6), consider heading toward (8, 9) apple via UP moves, but watch enemy\u2019s position \u2014 avoid letting it cut off escape routes. Keep distance from enemy head to prevent head-on collisions.\n\nRIGHT",

Immediate safety check from (8, 7):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (8, 8): Empty \u2014 safe \u2705  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8, 6): My body segment (neck) \u2014 unsafe \u274c  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7, 7): Empty \u2014 safe \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9, 7): Empty \u2014 safe \u2705  \n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy threat analysis:\n\nEnemy head at (7, 5). Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP (7, 6): My body segment (7, 6) \u2014 unsafe for enemy \u274c  \n- DOWN (7, 4): Empty \u2014 safe \u2705  \n- LEFT (6, 5): Its own body segment \u2014 unsafe \u274c  \n- RIGHT (8, 5): Empty \u2014 safe \u2705  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: DOWN to (7, 4) or RIGHT to (8, 5).  \nEnemy might move toward apple (8, 9) via RIGHT then UP later, but not immediate threat.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple proximity and growth:\n\nClosest apple: (8, 9) \u2014 2 steps away (UP, UP from (8, 7)).  \nOther apples: (1, 7) far, (3, 7) far, (9, 3) far, (1, 9) far.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility after each move:\n\n- **UP to (8, 8)**:  \n  Next turn from (8, 8): UP (8, 9) apple \u2014 eating apple safe if no enemy threat, DOWN (8, 7) neck \u274c, LEFT (7, 8) empty, RIGHT (9, 8) empty \u2192 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n  Gets closer to apple.\n\n- **LEFT to (7, 7)**:  \n  Next turn from (7, 7): UP (7, 8) empty, DOWN (7, 6) my body \u274c, LEFT (6, 7) empty, RIGHT (8, 7) neck \u274c \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n  Enemy at (7, 5) could move UP to (7, 6) next turn, blocking my DOWN option later.\n\n- **RIGHT to (9, 7)**:  \n  Next turn from (9, 7): UP (9, 8) empty, DOWN (9, 6) empty, LEFT (8, 7) neck \u274c, RIGHT off board \u274c \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n  Edge of board reduces options.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Best choice:\n\nUP gives best future mobility (3 options next turn) and moves toward apple (8, 9).  \nEnemy not threatening (8, 8) next turn since it can\u2019t reach there in one move from (7, 5).  \nLEFT and RIGHT reduce future options.\n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan for next turns after this:**  \nAfter UP to (8, 8), next turn go UP to (8, 9) to eat apple if enemy not threatening. Watch enemy movement \u2014 it may go RIGHT to (8, 5) then UP to (8, 6), possibly blocking my path later. Keep distance.\n\nUP",

The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (8, 7) with its body at [(8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7)].\n\n## Current Position and Apple Proximity\nI'm now at (7, 5) with my body at [(6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5), (4, 5)]. I need to decide my next move to continue growing and positioning myself strategically.\n\n## Possible Moves and Safety\nI need to evaluate which move:\n1. Gets me closer to apples\n2. Maintains flexibility for future moves\n3. Avoids potential future conflicts\n\n## Move Analysis\nLooking at the four possible directions:\n- UP: Move to (7, 6) - This is the enemy snake's body, would kill me\n- DOWN: Move to (7, 4) - This is a safe move\n- LEFT: Move to (6, 5) - This is my own body, would kill me\n- RIGHT: Move to (8, 5) - This is a safe move\n\n## Apple Proximity Analysis\nThe closest apples to my current position are:\n- (8, 6): 1 cell away (up 1)\n- (9, 3): 2 cells away (right 1, down 2)\n- (8, 9): 3 cells away (up 4)\n- (3, 7): 5 cells away (left 4, up 2)\n- (1, 7): 7 cells away (left 6, up 2)\n\n## Enemy Snake Analysis\nThe enemy snake is at (8, 7) with its body at (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), and (4, 7). Its possible safe moves are:\n- UP: (8, 8) - this is a safe move\n- RIGHT: (9, 7) - this is a safe move\n- LEFT: (7, 7) - this is a safe move\n\nSo the enemy snake has three safe moves: UP to (8, 8), RIGHT to (9, 7), or LEFT to (7, 7).\n\n## Decision\nI'll move RIGHT to (8, 5). This move:\n- Keeps me safe from immediate death\n- Gets me closer to the apple at (8, 6), which is one of the closest apples\n- Gets me closer to the apple at (9, 3)\n- Maintains flexibility for future moves\n- Positions me to potentially go for the apple at (8, 9) as well\n- If the enemy moves UP to (8, 8), RIGHT to (9, 7), or LEFT to (7, 7), we'll be separated by at least one cell, reducing the risk of future conflict\n\nRIGHT\nRIGHT",

Immediate safety check from (8, 8):**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (8, 9): Contains apple \u2014 safe (eating apple is safe as long as no enemy enters or body collision on entry) \u2705  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8, 7): My body segment \u2014 unsafe  \u274c  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7, 8): Empty \u2014 safe \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9, 8): Empty \u2014 safe \u2705  \n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**2. Enemy threat analysis:**\n\nEnemy head at (8, 5). Possible enemy moves:\n- UP (8, 6): My body segment \u2014 unsafe for enemy  \u274c  \n- DOWN (8, 4): Empty \u2014 safe \u2705  \n- LEFT (7, 5): Its own body \u2014 unsafe  \u274c  \n- RIGHT (9, 5): Empty \u2014 safe \u2705  \n\nEnemy\u2019s safe moves: DOWN to (8, 4) and RIGHT to (9, 5).  \n\nNeither threatens my safe moves next turn except:\nIf I go UP to (8, 9), could enemy threaten (8, 9) next turn? No, because from (8, 5) enemy can\u2019t reach (8, 9) directly \u2014 needs 2 moves. But head-on collision check: enemy may go UP next turn? Actually no, UP is blocked by my body at (8, 6) => enemy will avoid UP this turn unless suicidal.  \n\nThus no enemy head-on collision risk this turn for any of my moves.\n\n---\n\n**3. Apple proximity and strategy:**\n\nApple at (8, 9) \u2014 directly UP from my head.  \nEating increases length to 7 (beneficial but care about getting trapped later).  \nMust check after eating apple next turn mobility: from (8, 9):  \nPossible moves: DOWN (neck -> unsafe), LEFT (7, 9) empty, RIGHT (9, 9) empty \u2014 only 2 safe moves afterward.\n\n---\n\n**4. Future mobility analysis:**\n\nFrom (8, 8):\n- **UP to (8, 9)**: as above, next turn leaves only 2 moves.  \n- **LEFT to (7, 8)**: next turn options:  \n  UP -> (7, 9) empty, DOWN -> (7, 7) empty, LEFT -> (6, 8) empty, RIGHT -> neck  \u274c \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n- **RIGHT to (9, 8)**: next turn options:  \n  UP -> (9, 9) empty, DOWN -> (9, 7) empty, LEFT -> neck \u274c, RIGHT -> off board \u274c \u2192 2 safe moves.\n\nSo LEFT gives best future mobility (3 options).\n\n---\n\n**5. Enemy future threat after LEFT move:**\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 8), enemy\u2019s possible positions next turn:  \nEnemy could move to (8, 4) or (9, 5), none threaten (7, 8) next turn directly.  \nBut if enemy goes (9, 5), it might block my path to right side later \u2014 no immediate danger.\n\n---\n\n**6. Trade-off: Apple vs Mobility**\n\nTaking apple now increases my length but could box me in on top edge next turn if not careful.  \nSince enemy is not immediately threatening, I can afford to delay apple and keep mobility high.\n\nLEFT seems strategically better: keep options open, avoid trapping myself on edge with fewer moves.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:** After LEFT, assess enemy movement; possibly approach apple (8, 9) from the left side (7, 8) -> (7, 9) -> maybe (8, 9) if safe, or go for center apples later.\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Wait check \u2014 careful: Board shows: head (7, 8) \u2192 segment (8, 8) \u2192 (8, 7) \u2192 (8, 6) \u2192 (7, 6) \u2192 etc.  \nApples: (1, 7), (8, 9), (9, 3), (3, 7), (1, 9)  \n\nEnemy snake #0 head: (9, 5), body: [(8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4)], length 6.  \n\n---\n\n**1. Immediate safety check from (7, 8):**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (7, 9): empty \u2014 safe \u2705  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (7, 7): empty \u2014 safe \u2705  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (6, 8): empty \u2014 safe \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8, 8): my body segment \u2014 unsafe  \u274c  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**2. Enemy threat analysis:**\n\nEnemy head at (9, 5). Possible moves:  \n- UP (9, 6): empty \u2014 safe for them \u2705  \n- DOWN (9, 4): empty \u2014 safe \u2705  \n- LEFT (8, 5): their body \u2014 unsafe \u274c  \n- RIGHT off board \u2014 unsafe \u274c  \n\nEnemy\u2019s safe moves: UP to (9, 6), DOWN to (9, 4).  \n\nCould they collide with my head directly?   \nMy options:  \n- UP to (7, 9) \u2014 enemy cannot reach in one move from (9, 5)  \n- DOWN to (7, 7) \u2014 enemy cannot reach  \n- LEFT to (6, 8) \u2014 enemy cannot reach  \n\nSo no head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Future mobility:**  \n\nFrom (7, 8):  \n- **UP (7, 9)**: next turn options \u2014 DOWN = neck \u274c, LEFT (6, 9) empty, RIGHT (8, 9) apple but possibly contested? Wait enemy not near. Actually (8, 9) empty except there\u2019s apple. But moving there from (7, 9), neck is (7, 8), so RIGHT is safe. So: after UP \u2192 LEFT, RIGHT safe \u2192 2 moves.  \n- **DOWN (7, 7)**: next turn \u2014 UP = neck \u274c, LEFT (6, 7) empty, DOWN (7, 6) my body \u274c, RIGHT (8, 7) my body \u274c \u2192 only LEFT is safe \u2192 1 move.  \n- **LEFT (6, 8)**: next turn \u2014 UP (6, 9) empty, DOWN (6, 7) empty, LEFT (5, 8) empty, RIGHT = neck \u274c \u2192 3 moves.  \n\nLEFT gives best mobility afterward.\n\n---\n\n**4. Apple gathering:**  \n\nApple at (8, 9) is reachable via UP then RIGHT or RIGHT then UP but RIGHT is blocked now. So possible path: UP this turn, then next turn RIGHT to (8, 9) if safe. But risks? After UP, enemy might move into (8, 9)? Enemy\u2019s turn: from (9,5) to (9,6) is possible, then next turn enemy could go LEFT to (8,6) body blocked etc. Actually enemy can\u2019t reach (8,9) from (9,5) in 1 move, but after my UP to (7,9), enemy moving UP to (9,6), next turn he could go LEFT to (8,6) then up to (8,7) but my snake\u2019s body there... actually wall of bodies along (8,6)-(8,7). Still, apple (8,9) safe to approach.  \n\nBut apple (1, 7), (3, 7), (1, 9) are across the board \u2014 long term, maybe safer to control center.\n\n---\n\n**5. Enemy movement prediction and blockage:**  \n\nEnemy might go UP to (9,6) or DOWN to (9,4). Going DOWN keeps them near my tail potentially. I\u2019d rather steer clear. LEFT move seems good to avoid immediate entanglements.\n\n---\n\n**6. Conclusion**  \n\nBest: LEFT to (6, 8) for best mobility and staying central. Avoid trapping myself with limited moves (DOWN worst mobility). UP acceptable but slightly less flexible than LEFT.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** After LEFT, consider moving UP/LEFT to target apple (3,7) area eventually, avoid being forced against walls by enemy.  \n\nLEFT",

This move:\n- Is safe from immediate death\n- Moves me towards the center of the board, giving me more flexibility for future moves\n- Avoids getting trapped in the corner\n- If the enemy moves in any direction, we'll be separated by at least 3 cells, reducing the risk of future conflict\n- Positions me to potentially go for the apple at (8, 9) which is 6 cells away\n\nLEFT\nLEFT",

Their possible moves:  \n- UP (8, 5): their body \u274c unsafe  \n- DOWN (8, 3): their body \u274c unsafe  \n- LEFT (7, 4): empty \u2705 safe  \n- RIGHT (9, 4): their body \u274c unsafe  \n\nEnemy\u2019s only safe move: LEFT to (7, 4).  \n\nCould they collide with me next turn?  \nIf I go:  \n- UP (4, 8): enemy can\u2019t reach in 1 move  \n- DOWN (4, 6): enemy can\u2019t reach in 1 move  \n- LEFT (3, 7): enemy can\u2019t reach in 1 move  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision possible.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Future mobility after each safe move  \n\n**UP to (4, 8)**:  \nNext turn: UP (4, 9) empty, DOWN = neck \u274c, LEFT (3, 8) empty, RIGHT (5, 8) my body \u274c \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\n**DOWN to (4, 6)**:  \nNext turn: UP = neck \u274c, DOWN (4, 5) empty, LEFT (3, 6) empty, RIGHT (5, 6) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n**LEFT to (3, 7)**:  \nNext turn: UP (3, 8) empty, DOWN (3, 6) empty, LEFT (2, 7) empty, RIGHT = neck \u274c \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nDOWN and LEFT give best mobility (3 moves), UP gives only 2 moves.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Apple gathering  \nClosest apples:  \n- (3, 7) \u2013 already adjacent if I go LEFT now.  \n- (1, 7) \u2013 two moves away after LEFT.  \n- (1, 4) \u2013 longer term.  \n- (8, 9) \u2013 far away, enemy might go for it later.  \n\nLEFT directly gets me to apple (3, 7) next turn if I move there now.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Enemy movement prediction  \nEnemy must go LEFT to (7, 4). That\u2019s far from my LEFT path.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Avoid trapping  \nUP reduces options next turn (only 2 moves), so less flexible.  \nLEFT and DOWN both give 3 moves next turn, but LEFT gets me an apple immediately next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns**:  \nAfter LEFT to (3, 7), eat apple (3, 7) next turn if still there. Then head toward (1, 7) or (1, 4) while keeping an eye on enemy\u2019s path.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",
