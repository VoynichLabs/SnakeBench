Moving **LEFT** to **(8,5)** does exactly that: it puts us one step closer to those apples and gives us plenty of room to swing up, down, or keep sliding left afterward.  \n\nLong\u2011term game plan:  \n- Grab the apple at (7,6) or (7,4) ASAP.  \n- Then pivot south\u2011west, corral the opponent into a tighter corridor, and look for a head\u2011on when we\u2019ve got the score edge.  \n\nSo, let\u2019s make that aggressive, space\u2011opening move!  \n\n**LEFT**",

Heading left would pull me away from the richest apple zone and give the rival extra room.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Safety** \u2013 (7,\u202f9) is completely free; opponent cannot reach it this turn, and no self\u2011collision risk exists.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Future flexibility** \u2013 After moving right, I\u2019ll still have multiple safe options (right to the apple, then down or left to wall\u2011off).

None of those intersect my immediate options, so a head\u2011on clash this turn is impossible.\n\n**Strategic comparison**\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9,\u202f9)**  \n  - Locks me in the top\u2011right corner.  \n  - Next turn I\u2019d have only one safe continuation (DOWN to (9,\u202f8)).  \n  - Quick wall\u2011hug, but gives me very limited maneuverability early on.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,\u202f8)**  \n  - Keeps me on the open top\u2011row corridor.  \n  - From (8,\u202f8) I\u2019ll have three viable exits (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN).  \n  - Opens a path toward the rich apple line at **(1,\u202f8)** and the top\u2011row apples at (2,\u202f9)\u202f&\u202f(3,\u202f9).  \n  **\u2192 More options = less chance of self\u2011trapping later.**\n\nGiven we\u2019re neck\u2011and\u2011neck (4\u20114) and the board is still spacious, preserving flexibility wins the long game. Grab the apple now, then swing left along the 8\u2011row, scoop up the distant apples, and eventually corner the rival in the low\u2011left quadrant.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**\n\n1. **Move\u202fDOWN** to (8,\u202f8).  \n2. Next turn aim **LEFT** towards the (1,\u202f8) apple line, then drop **DOWN** the wall\u2011side to claim the (0,\u202f7) and (9,\u202f7) apples.  \n3. Keep growing while the opponent scrambles for the bottom\u2011left space.  \n\n**\u2694\ufe0f Goal** \u2013 Grow a few more segments, dominate the top\u2011right corridor, and set the trap that forces the enemy into a dead\u2011end.\n\n**MOVE:**  \nDOWN",

Right is blocked by our own body, but we\u2019ll still have a wide escape corridor along the left wall.\n- If we go **DOWN** to (2,\u202f7): we\u2019d lose the up\u2011ward escape (it becomes our body) and be limited to just down or left next turn.\n\n**\u2694\ufe0f Opponent interaction**\n\nThe rival is at (5,\u202f3). No head\u2011on danger this turn, and moving left forces us into the top\u2011left quadrant where the opponent will have to navigate around a longer snake \u2013 perfect for setting a trap later.\n\n**\ud83e\udded Short\u2011term plan**\n\n1. **LEFT** now \u2192 eat the apple, grow, and shift toward the left wall.  \n2. Use the newly gained length to block the opponent\u2019s path upward when they try to chase apples on the left side.  \n3. Keep a \u201cwiggle room\u201d corridor along the left edge (up/down) to avoid being cornered.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Decision**\n\nGrab the apple, grow, and gain positional advantage.\n\nLEFT",

After moving up I\u2019ll be a bit boxed in, but the opponent is still three cells away (head at\u202f6,\u202f6) and can\u2019t reach (2,\u202f7) in one move. The only way I could die immediately is by stepping into my own tail, which isn\u2019t adjacent, so \u201cUP\u201d keeps me alive for *at least* this round.  \n\nGiven the rules, staying alive longer gives me the chance to out\u2011maneuver #1 later, and I\u2019m already ahead on apples (14\u202fvs\u202f9). So let\u2019s push forward and see what the rival does! \ud83d\ude80  \n\n**Move:**  \nUP",
