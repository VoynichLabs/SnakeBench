Moving RIGHT would delay the nearby apple and push me away from the clear vertical corridor in column 0.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move UP to (0,6), then continue UP to take the apple at (0,7). After that, head east while avoiding the bottom row where snake #0 dominates.\n\nUP",

Evaluate all four directions for immediate fatal moves (elimination):\n   - LEFT: New head (1,1) \u2192 part of own body (second segment) (fatal \u2192 invalid).\n   - DOWN: New head (2,0) \u2192 part of own body (fifth segment) (fatal \u2192 invalid).\n   - UP: New head (2,2) \u2192 part of Enemy Snake 1\u2019s body (segment (2,2)) (fatal \u2192 invalid).\n   - RIGHT: New head (3,1) \u2192 part of Enemy Snake 1\u2019s body (segment (3,1)) (fatal \u2192 invalid).\n\n3. Critical Observation: No non-fatal moves are available. This results from Enemy Snake 1\u2019s persistent blockage of all adjacent cells and my own body segments blocking downward/leftward paths\u2014creating an inescapable death trap.\n\nLong-Term Strategy Note for Future Self (if survival were possible):\n1. Imminent elimination is unavoidable unless Enemy Snake 1 vacates adjacent segments in their next move; no viable path to apples or escape exists in the current state.\n2. If a last-minute reprieve occurs (Enemy 1 moves away from (2,2) or (3,1)), prioritize UP/RIGHT checks first to test for safe escape routes toward the (0,7) apple cluster.\n\nUP",
