(0, 9) - top left quadrant\n4.  (9, 7) - top right quadrant\n5.  (3, 6) - top left quadrant\n\n**Snake positions**\n\n- Your snake (ID 0) is at (0, 4) with no body segments.\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) is at (6, 4) with no body segments.\n\n**Immediate safety assessment**\n\nFrom (0, 4), all four cardinal directions are safe because:\n- UP (0, 5): Empty cell\n- DOWN (0, 3): Empty cell\n- LEFT (-1, 4): Off-board (invalid)\n- RIGHT (1, 4): Empty cell\n\nSo LEFT is eliminated as a death move.\n\n**Strategic considerations**\n\n1. **Proximity to apples**: The closest apple to you is (0, 1) at distance 3 cells (moving DOWN twice). The next closest is (0, 9) at distance 5 cells (moving UP 5 times).\n\n2. **Enemy positioning**: The enemy snake is at (6, 4), same row as you. It's 6 cells to the right horizontally.\n\n3. **Movement prediction**: Since the enemy has no body, it can move in any direction without self-collision risk. It may head toward the same apple you're targeting, or it might go for a different one.\n\n4. **Board control**: Moving DOWN toward (0, 1) gives you a head start on that apple while staying on the edge of the board, which can be strategically advantageous for future movement options.\n\n**Decision rationale**\n\n- **UP (0, 5)**: Moves away from the nearest apple (0, 1) and toward (0, 9), but this is a longer journey and might allow the enemy to intercept.\n- **DOWN (0, 3)**: Moves directly toward the closest apple (0, 1) at distance 2 after this move. This gives you a clear path to collect an apple before the enemy can reach it.\n- **RIGHT (1, 4)**: Moves horizontally, not directly toward any apple, and puts you more in the same space as the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategic plan for the next few turns**\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 3), my next moves should be:\n1. DOWN to (0, 2) - getting closer to apple (0, 1)\n2. DOWN to (0, 1) - collecting the apple\n3. After collecting, assess the board for the next closest apple while maintaining safe distance from the enemy snake\n\nThis plan prioritizes immediate apple collection while maintaining board position and keeping multiple movement options open.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMoving DOWN toward the closest apple (0, 1) provides the best combination of immediate safety, progress toward scoring, and strategic positioning. It allows me to collect an apple before the enemy can reach it, giving me an early advantage in the game.\n\nDOWN",

Both snakes are single-segment (just heads), so no body collision risks yet.\n2. The enemy snake is at (0, 4), which is on the left edge. It cannot move LEFT (would go off-board).\n3. You are at (6, 4), with open space in all directions except possibly into the enemy (but it's far away).\n\n**Possible Moves and Safety Check:**\n1. UP: (6, 5) - Safe (empty space).\n2. DOWN: (6, 3) - Safe (empty space).\n3. LEFT: (5, 4) - Safe (empty space).\n4. RIGHT: (7, 4) - Safe (empty space).\n\nAll moves are safe since there are no bodies to collide with and the board is open.\n\n**Apple Considerations:**\n- Closest apples to you:\n  - (3, 6): 3 left, 2 up (distance ~3.6).\n  - (8, 2): 2 right, 2 down (distance ~2.8).\n  - (9, 7): 3 right, 3 up (distance ~4.2).\n- The enemy is closer to (0, 1) and (0, 9) (both on x=0).\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction:**\n- The enemy is at (0, 4). It cannot move LEFT (off-board). It will likely move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n  - If it moves RIGHT to (1, 4), it could head toward (3, 6) or other apples.\n  - If it moves UP/DOWN, it might go for (0, 9) or (0, 1).\n\n**Your Strategy:**\n- Avoid moving toward the enemy (LEFT is toward x=0, but the enemy is far, so not urgent).\n- Prioritize moving toward apples while keeping options open.\n- (8, 2) is the closest apple to you (distance ~2.8). Moving RIGHT or DOWN would help reach it.\n  - RIGHT to (7, 4) is toward (8, 2).\n  - DOWN to (6, 3) is also toward (8, 2).\n- (3, 6) is another option, but farther and the enemy might go for it.\n\n**Future Options:**\n- Moving RIGHT keeps you flexible to go for (8, 2) or (9, 7).\n- Moving DOWN also keeps options open for (8, 2) or (3, 6).\n\n**Head-on Collision Risk:**\n- The enemy is far away (x=0 vs your x=6), so no immediate head-on risk.\n\n**Decision:**\n- RIGHT is slightly better than DOWN because:\n  - It moves you closer to (8, 2) and (9, 7).\n  - It keeps you away from the enemy's potential path (if it moves RIGHT).\n  - It doesn't commit you to a single apple yet.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn:**\n- Continue moving toward (8, 2) unless the enemy blocks or a better apple becomes available.\n- Monitor enemy movement to avoid future collisions.\n\n**Final Move:**\nRIGHT",

It's closer to the (8, 2) apple (distance 2) than I am.\n\n3.  **Movement prediction**: Since both snakes have no body, we can move in any direction without self-collision risk. The enemy might head toward the same apple I'm targeting.\n\n4.  **Board control**: Moving DOWN toward (0, 1) gives me a clear path to collect an apple immediately. Moving UP would be slower and might allow the enemy to intercept. Moving RIGHT puts me more in the enemy's path.\n\n**Decision rationale**\n\n- **UP (0, 3)**: Moves away from the nearest apple (0, 1) and toward (0, 9), but this is a longer journey and might allow the enemy to intercept.\n- **DOWN (0, 1)**: Moves directly toward the closest apple (0, 1) and collects it immediately. This gives me an early advantage and a point.\n- **RIGHT (1, 2)**: Moves horizontally, not directly toward any apple, and puts me more in the same space as the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategic plan for the next few turns**\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0, 1) and collect the apple, I will have 1 apple. My next moves should be:\n1.  Assess the board for the next closest apple while maintaining safe distance from the enemy snake.\n2.  Given the enemy's position, it's likely heading for (8, 2) or (9, 7), so I should focus on the left-side apples (0, 9) and (3, 6) after getting (0, 1).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMoving DOWN toward the closest apple (0, 1) provides the best combination of immediate safety, progress toward scoring, and strategic positioning. It allows me to collect an apple before the enemy can reach it, giving me an early advantage in the game.\n\nDOWN",

Your snake is still single-segment, so no body collision risks.\n2. The enemy is at (0, 1) with a body segment at (0, 2). It cannot move LEFT (off-board) or DOWN (into its own body).\n3.

Your snake is at (7, 1) with body at (7, 2). Moving UP to (7, 2) would collide with your own body (invalid).\n2. The enemy is at (2, 0) with body segments at (1, 0) and (0, 0). It cannot move LEFT or DOWN (off-board or into its own body).\n3. You are near the right edge (x=7), so moving RIGHT is unsafe (edge at x=9).\n\n**Possible Moves and Safety Check:**\n1. UP: (7, 2) - Invalid (body collision).\n2. DOWN: (7, 0) - Safe (empty space, apple at (7, 0)).\n3. LEFT: (6, 1) - Safe (empty space).\n4. RIGHT: (8, 1) - Safe (empty space).\n\n**Apple Considerations:**\n- Closest apples to you:\n  - (7, 0): 0 left, 1 down (distance ~1.0).\n  - (5, 4): 2 left, 3 up (distance ~3.6).\n  - (3, 6): 4 left, 5 up (distance ~6.4).\n- The enemy is closer to (0, 9) and (7, 0).\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction:**\n- The enemy is at (2, 0) with body segments at (1, 0) and (0, 0). It cannot move LEFT or DOWN.\n  - It will likely move UP to (2, 1) or RIGHT to (3, 0) to head toward (7, 0) or (0, 9).\n\n**Your Strategy:**\n- (7, 0) is the closest apple (1 cell down). Moving DOWN would let you collect it immediately.\n  - DOWN to (7, 0) is a direct move to the apple.\n- Moving DOWN is the best option because it allows you to collect the apple and grow.\n\n**Head-on Collision Risk:**\n- The enemy is far away (x=2 vs your x=7), so no immediate head-on risk.\n\n**Decision:**\n- DOWN is the best move because:\n  - It allows you to collect the apple at (7, 0).\n  - It keeps you flexible to go for other apples next.\n  - It avoids moving toward the enemy's potential path.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn:**\n- After moving DOWN and collecting the apple, continue heading toward (5, 4) or (3, 6) to collect more apples.\n- Monitor enemy movement to avoid future collisions.\n\n**Final Move:**\nDOWN",

It cannot move DOWN or LEFT.\n  - It will likely move UP to (3, 6) to head toward the apple at (3, 6) or (0, 9).\n\n**Your Strategy:**\n- (5, 4) is the closest apple (0 left, 1 up). Moving UP would let you head toward it.\n  - UP to (5, 4) is a direct move toward the apple.\n- Moving LEFT to (4, 3) is also safe but doesn't directly head toward any apple.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6, 3) is safe but doesn't directly head toward any apple.\n- Moving UP is the best option because it allows you to head toward the apple and keeps you flexible to go for other apples next.\n  - It also avoids moving toward the enemy's potential path.\n\n**Head-on Collision Risk:**\n- The enemy is far away (x=3 vs your x=5), so no immediate head-on risk.\n\n**Decision:**\n- UP is the best move because:\n  - It allows you to head toward the apple at (5, 4).\n  - It keeps you flexible to go for other apples next.\n  - It avoids moving toward the enemy's potential path.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn:**\n- After moving UP, continue heading toward (5, 4) to collect the apple.\n- Monitor enemy movement to avoid future collisions.\n\n**Final Move:**\nUP",

Your snake is at (7, 7) with body segments at (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), and (6, 4). Moving LEFT to (6, 7) would collide with your own body (invalid).\n2. The enemy is at (0, 8) with body segments at (0, 7), (1, 7), and (1, 6). It cannot move LEFT (off-board) or DOWN (into its own body).\n3. You are near the right edge (x=7), so moving RIGHT to (8, 7) is safe (empty space).\n\n**Possible Moves and Safety Check:**\n1. UP: (7, 8) - Safe (empty space).\n2. DOWN: (7, 6) - Safe (empty space).\n3. LEFT: (6, 7) - Invalid (body collision).\n4. RIGHT: (8, 7) - Safe (empty space).\n\n**Apple Considerations:**\n- Closest apples to you:\n  - (9, 7): 1 right (distance ~1).\n  - (3, 7): 4 left (distance ~4).\n- The enemy is closer to (0, 9) and (0, 4).\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction:**\n- The enemy is at (0, 8) with body segments at (0, 7), (1, 7), and (1, 6). It cannot move LEFT or DOWN.\n  - It will likely move UP to (0, 9) to head toward the apple at (0, 9).\n\n**Your Strategy:**\n- (9, 7) is the closest apple (1 right). Moving RIGHT would let you head toward (9, 7).\n  - Moving RIGHT to (8, 7) is a direct move toward the apple at (9, 7).\n- Moving UP to (7, 8) is safe but doesn't directly head toward any apple.\n- Moving DOWN to (7, 6) is safe but doesn't directly head toward any apple.\n- Moving RIGHT is the best option because it allows you to head toward the apple at (9, 7) and keeps you flexible to go for other apples next.\n  - It also avoids moving toward the enemy's potential path.\n\n**Head-on Collision Risk:**\n- The enemy is far away (x=0 vs your x=7), so no immediate head-on risk.\n\n**Decision:**\n- RIGHT is the best move because:\n  - It allows you to head toward the apple at (9, 7).\n  - It keeps you flexible to go for other apples next.\n  - It avoids moving toward the enemy's potential path.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn:**\n- After moving RIGHT, continue heading toward (9, 7) to collect the next apple.\n- Monitor enemy movement to avoid future collisions.\n\n**Final Move:**\nRIGHT",

Collect the apple at (0, 9) to reach 4 total apples\n2. After collecting, I'll need to navigate to other apples while avoiding the enemy\n3. The left side of the board appears to be my territory while the enemy is centered on the right\n\nRIGHT",

Your head is at (9, 6) with body segments at (9,7), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (6,6)\n2. The apple at (9,4) is directly below you (distance 2)\n3. The enemy is at (0,9) with body segments at (1,9), (1,8), (0,8), (0,7)\n4. You're at the right edge (x=9) and near the top (y=6)\n\n**Possible Moves and Safety Check:**\n1. UP: (9,7) - Invalid (body collision)\n2. DOWN: (9,5) - Safe (empty space)\n3. LEFT: (8,6) - Safe (empty space)\n4. RIGHT: (10,6) - Invalid (off-board)\n\n**Apple Considerations:**\n- (9,4) is directly below you - you can move towards it\n- (3,7) is far left\n- (0,9) and (0,4) are on the left edge\n- (8,0) is far down\n- (1,1) is far down-left\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction:**\n- Enemy is at (0,9) with body at (1,9), (1,8), (0,8), (0,7)\n- Cannot move LEFT (off-board) or UP (off-board)\n- Likely to move DOWN to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,9)\n\n**Your Strategy:**\n- DOWN to (9,5) is optimal because:\n  - It moves you towards the apple at (9,4)\n  - The space is safe (no body segments or enemy)\n  - It positions you to continue moving down to eat the apple at (9,4)\n\n**Head-on Collision Risk:**\n- Enemy is far away (x=0 vs your x=9), so no immediate collision risk\n\n**Decision:**\n- DOWN is the best move because it allows you to move towards the apple at (9,4) and keeps you safe.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn:**\n- After moving to (9,5), continue moving DOWN to (9,4) to eat the apple\n- Monitor enemy movement to avoid future collisions\n\nDOWN",

Let me double-check:\n\n- **My body:** [(0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 9)] - yes, all adjacent cells are occupied\n- **Board edges:** At (0, 9), so UP and LEFT are off-board\n- **Enemy:** Far away at (9, 6), not blocking me\n\nI'm completely trapped with no safe moves available. I cannot avoid death on this turn.\n\n**Strategic Note:** This appears to be a game-over situation. I have no safe moves and will die regardless of choice. The enemy is at 5 apples, I'm at 4. The game will end immediately with the enemy winning.\n\nRIGHT",
