Possible enemy moves: UP (7,8), DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7), RIGHT (8,7).  \nIf I move LEFT to (7,5), enemy moving DOWN to (7,6) wouldn't collide with me. If enemy moves RIGHT to (8,7), no collision. If enemy moves LEFT or UP, also no collision. So no head-on risk with LEFT.  \n\nIf I move UP to (8,6), enemy moving DOWN to (7,6) no collision. Enemy moving RIGHT to (8,7) no collision.  \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,5), enemy would need to move two steps to reach me, so safe.  \n\nIf I move DOWN to (8,4), enemy far away, safe.  \n\nSo all four moves safe from immediate death.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nApples: (7,4), (3,5), (3,0), (4,1), (9,4).  \nFrom (8,5):  \n- Distance to (7,4): |8-7|+|5-4|=2 steps.  \n- Distance to (3,5): 5 steps.  \n- Distance to (9,4): |8-9|+|5-4|=2 steps.  \n- Distance to (4,1): 8 steps.  \n- Distance to (3,0): 10 steps.  \n\nClosest apples: (7,4) and (9,4).  \n\nDOWN to (8,4) gets me closer to (7,4) (now 1 step away) and also closer to (9,4) (now 2 steps away).  \nLEFT to (7,5) gets me closer to (7,4) (now 1 vertical step away).  \nRIGHT to (9,5) gets me closer to (9,4) (now 1 vertical step away).  \n\n**Future mobility:**  \nAt (8,5), moving DOWN to (8,4): next turn, possible moves from (8,4): UP back to (8,5), LEFT (7,4) apple, RIGHT (9,4) apple, DOWN (8,3). Three safe moves likely unless enemy blocks.  \n\nMoving LEFT to (7,5): next turn from (7,5): UP (7,6), DOWN (7,4) apple, LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5). Also three safe moves likely.  \n\nMoving RIGHT to (9,5): next turn from (9,5): UP (9,6), DOWN (9,4) apple, LEFT (8,5), RIGHT off board \u2192 only 3 safe moves unless board edge reduces options.  \n\nMoving UP to (8,6): next turn from (8,6): UP (8,7), DOWN (8,5), LEFT (7,6), RIGHT (9,6). All safe likely.  \n\nAll have decent mobility.  \n\n**Enemy positioning:** Enemy at (7,7). If I move LEFT to (7,5), I'm closer to enemy but still safe distance. Enemy might go for apple at (7,4) too \u2014 we could both want it next turn, but I'm closer if I go LEFT then DOWN, or if I go DOWN then LEFT.  \n\nBest move to get apple quickly: DOWN to (8,4) \u2192 next turn LEFT to (7,4) gets apple, and also sets up for other apples.  \n\n**Short-term plan:**  \nGet apple at (7,4) next turn if possible, avoid moving toward enemy unnecessarily since enemy length 1 can't trap me yet.  \n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN gets me closest to two apples (7,4) and (9,4) and keeps options open.  \n\nDOWN",

Snake movement: head moves to (7,5), tail cell (8,4) disappears, body becomes [(7,5), (7,4)].  \nSo after UP move without eating apple: head at (7,5), body segment at (7,4).  \n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,3): head at (7,3), body at (7,4).  \n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,4): head at (6,4), body at (7,4).  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy possible moves from (7,7):**  \nEnemy safe moves: UP (7,8), DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7), RIGHT (8,7) \u2014 all empty currently.  \n\nCould enemy move toward (9,4) apple? They\u2019re at (7,7), apple at (9,4) is \u0394x=+2, \u0394y=-3. They might go RIGHT then DOWN, etc. They are 5 moves away from that apple.  \n\nIf I go LEFT toward (3,5) area, enemy is farther from those apples currently.  \n\n---\n\n**Risk of head-on collision this turn:**  \nEnemy could move DOWN to (7,6) or LEFT to (6,7) etc. My possible moves:  \nUP (7,5) \u2014 enemy could move DOWN to (7,6) \u2014 no collision.  \nDOWN (7,3) \u2014 enemy far.  \nLEFT (6,4) \u2014 enemy could move LEFT to (6,7) \u2014 no collision (different y).  \n\nNo immediate head-on risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Future mobility:**  \nFrom (7,5): next moves UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT all likely safe unless enemy moves into them.  \nFrom (7,3): similar.  \nFrom (6,4): similar.  \n\nBut apple (9,4) is closest. To reach it in 2 moves: from (7,4) \u2192 (8,4) not safe (body). So must go UP/DOWN/LEFT first, then next turn move toward it. But enemy might get it first if I delay.  \n\nActually, if I go UP to (7,5), next turn I could go RIGHT to (8,5) then DOWN to (8,4)? No, (8,4) would be empty next turn (tail gone). Actually, after UP move, my tail disappears from (8,4), so (8,4) free next turn. Then from (7,5), I could go RIGHT (8,5), then next turn from (8,5) DOWN to (8,4) \u2192 apple (9,4) still 1 away. That\u2019s 3 moves to apple.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (6,4), apple (9,4) is even farther.  \n\nSo maybe best to go UP or DOWN to keep central and approach apples flexibly, not necessarily chasing (9,4) immediately.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy\u2019s potential to threaten me:**  \nIf enemy moves DOWN twice: (7,7) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (7,5), they could collide with me if I go to (7,5) now and they go to (7,6) then (7,5) next turn? Let\u2019s simulate:  \nNow: me at (7,4), enemy at (7,7).  \nIf I go UP to (7,5), enemy goes DOWN to (7,6). Next turn: me at (7,5), enemy at (7,6). If enemy goes DOWN again to (7,5), we collide heads and both die. But enemy doesn\u2019t know my move; they might avoid moving into me if they predict it. But simultaneous moves mean they could move into me accidentally. So UP has a slight risk if enemy goes DOWN twice.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (6,4), enemy less likely to collide.  \n\n---\n\nGiven my goal to survive and collect apples, I\u2019ll avoid risky adjacency with enemy head. Enemy at (7,7), me moving UP to (7,5) puts me 2 away from them vertically \u2014 safe this turn, but next turn if they move DOWN again, possible collision. Safer to move away from them.  \n\nLEFT to (6,4) increases distance to enemy and toward apple cluster (3,5), (4,1), etc.  \n\nI think LEFT is safest and positions for future apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (6,4), body: [(6,4), (7,4)]. Next turn safe moves from (6,4): UP (6,5), DOWN (6,3), LEFT (5,4), RIGHT (7,4) \u2014 but (7,4) is my body, so not safe. So 3 moves. Then aim toward (3,5) apple via UP/LEFT moves.  \n\nLEFT  \n\nLEFT",

I\u2019m at (6, 4) distance 3. So I\u2019m closer.  \n\nIf I move UP to (6, 5), next turn I could go RIGHT to (7, 5), then DOWN to (7, 4) \u2014 but (7, 4) will be empty next turn (tail gone), so that\u2019s safe, then to (8, 4) etc. That\u2019s 3 moves to reach (9, 4).  \n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 4), I\u2019m moving away from (9, 4). But (3, 5) cluster is also valuable.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy threat:** Enemy length 1, so no body to worry about. But if enemy moves toward (9, 4), they might take it before me if I delay.  \n\nLet\u2019s check:  \nEnemy at (7, 8), apple at (9, 4): quickest path: RIGHT to (8, 8), then DOWN 4 times? That\u2019s 5 moves. I can get there in 3 moves if I go UP now \u2192 RIGHT \u2192 DOWN \u2192 RIGHT.

Then they go DOWN to (7, 5) same time I go DOWN to (7, 4) \u2192 no collision. Seems low risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Better to go for closest apple** while keeping options open.  \n\nUP seems best: moves toward center, keeps (9, 4) reachable, and also (3, 5) reachable later.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter UP to (6, 5), next turn consider going RIGHT to (7, 5) to approach (9, 4), or LEFT toward other apples if enemy heads that way. Keep distance from enemy head (7, 8) \u2192 they might go DOWN soon.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

Moves towards the right of the board.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (5, 5) and its body is at (6, 5). If the enemy goes UP, it will be at (5, 6). If it goes DOWN, it will be at (5, 4). If it goes LEFT, it will be at (4, 5). If it goes RIGHT, it will be at (6, 5) - which is occupied by its body, so it can't go right.\n\nThe apple at (9, 4) is still relatively far away. The apples at (3,5), (3,0), (4,1), and (4,0) are all quite distant.\n\nMoving DOWN seems like a reasonable option. It keeps me away from the enemy and doesn't immediately put me in danger. Moving RIGHT also seems safe, but doesn't offer any immediate advantage. Moving LEFT is risky as it brings me closer to the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy note for next turn: I will continue to prioritize safe moves that keep me away from the enemy and allow me to explore the board. I will start to consider moving towards the apple at (9,4) if the enemy doesn't move in a way that blocks me. I will also try to avoid getting cornered. I will also try to move towards the right side of the board.\n\nDOWN",

Wait \u2014 head-on collision happens if two heads move into same cell simultaneously. Enemy at (7,8), moves possible for them: UP to (7,9), DOWN to (7,7), LEFT to (6,8), RIGHT to (8,8). None of these are (5,6). So UP is safe from head-on. No body there.  \n- DOWN (5,4): empty, safe.  \n- LEFT (4,5): empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT (6,5): my own body segment (tail). Moving into own body kills me. **RIGHT is unsafe.**  \n\nSo unsafe: RIGHT. Safe: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3 \u2014 Consider future options and apples:  \n\nFrom (5,5):  \n\n- **UP (5,6):**  \n  Next turn from (5,6): possible moves UP (5,7), DOWN (5,5) \u2014 but (5,5) will be empty now, so safe unless enemy moves there simultaneously (unlikely unless they move far). LEFT (4,6), RIGHT (6,6) \u2014 all likely safe next turn.  \n  Closest apple distances from (5,6):  \n    - (3,5) \u2192 Manhattan distance = |5-3| + |6-5| = 2+1=3  \n    - (9,4) \u2192 |5-9| + |6-4| = 4+2=6  \n    - (4,1) \u2192 |5-4| + |6-1| = 1+5=6  \n    - (3,0) \u2192 |5-3| + |6-0| = 2+6=8  \n    - (4,0) \u2192 |5-4| + |6-0| = 1+6=7  \n  So moving UP puts me farther from closest apple (3,5) compared to moving LEFT/DOWN.\n\n- **DOWN (5,4):**  \n  Next turn from (5,4): UP back to (5,5), DOWN to (5,3), LEFT (4,4), RIGHT (6,4). All likely safe.  \n  Distances from (5,4):  \n    - (3,5) \u2192 |5-3| + |4-5| = 2+1=3  \n    - (9,4) \u2192 |5-9| + |4-4| = 4+0=4  \n    - (4,1) \u2192 |5-4| + |4-1| = 1+3=4  \n    - (3,0) \u2192 |5-3| + |4-0| = 2+4=6  \n    - (4,0) \u2192 |5-4| + |4-0| = 1+4=5  \n  So DOWN keeps me moderately close to multiple apples.\n\n- **LEFT (4,5):**  \n  Next turn from (4,5): UP (4,6), DOWN (4,4), LEFT (3,5) \u2014 apple at (3,5) \u2014 so next turn I could eat it, RIGHT back to (5,5).  \n  Distances from (4,5):  \n    - (3,5) \u2192 1  \n    - (9,4) \u2192 |4-9| + |5-4| = 5+1=6  \n    - (4,1) \u2192 |4-4| + |5-1| = 0+4=4  \n    - (3,0) \u2192 |4-3| + |5-0| = 1+5=6  \n    - (4,0) \u2192 |4-4| + |5-0| = 0+5=5  \n  So LEFT puts me 1 step from apple at (3,5), which is the closest apple.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy considerations:** Enemy at (7,8), 1 segment, no apples, so they\u2019re not growing yet. They could move toward apples too. Closest apple to enemy: (9,4) distance = |7-9| + |8-4| = 2+4=6; (3,5) distance = |7-3| + |8-5| = 4+3=7. They are closer to (9,4) than to (3,5), so they might move toward (9,4) or toward other apples. But they might also move randomly.  \n\nIf I move LEFT toward (3,5), enemy is far enough (distance 7) that I can likely get it before them if I go directly.  \n\n---\n\n**Future safety:** After eating (3,5), my body will be: head at (3,5), body at [(4,5), (5,5), (6,5)] \u2014 length 4. Then I\u2019d be near the cluster of apples at (3,0), (4,0), (4,1) for continued growth.  \n\nSo LEFT seems best for gaining apples quickly.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nLEFT this turn to (4,5). Next turn, if apple (3,5) still there and no enemy head adjacent to it, move LEFT to eat it. Then head down toward bottom-left apple cluster while checking enemy movements.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Wait, careful: current body = [(3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)].

So maybe my last move did *not* eat an apple? Actually, the board state shows apple at (4,0) still present, so maybe last move RIGHT from (4,1) to (5,1) didn\u2019t eat apple. Yes, that\u2019s correct: apples at (3,0),(9,4),(4,0),(5,0),(6,6) \u2014 no apple at (5,1). So length is still 4.)  \n\n**Apples:** (3,0), (9,4), (4,0), (5,0), (6,6)  \n\n**Enemy snake #1:** Head (8,9), Body [(9,9),(9,8)], Apples: 2, length 3.  \n\n---\n\n**Possible moves from (5,1):**  \n- UP \u2192 (5,2): empty \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,0): apple \u2192 safe (no body there).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,1): my body (segment behind head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,1): empty \u2192 safe.  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy possible moves from (8,9):**  \n- UP \u2192 (8,10) out of bounds \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,8): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,9): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,9): its body \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nEnemy safe moves: DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**  \nEnemy could go DOWN to (8,8) or LEFT to (7,9). My safe moves: (5,2), (5,0), (6,1). No overlap with those enemy possible cells. So no immediate head-on collision danger.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple distances:**  \nFrom (5,1):  \n- (5,0): dist 1 (DOWN)  \n- (4,0): dist 2  \n- (3,0): dist 3  \n- (6,6): dist 7  \n- (9,4): dist 7  \n\nDOWN gives immediate apple \u2192 length 5, but check future mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n\n1. DOWN to (5,0) eat apple \u2192 length 5, body: [(5,0),(5,1),(4,1),(3,1),(3,2)]  \nNext turn from (5,0):  \nUP \u2192 (5,1): body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN \u2192 out of bounds \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (4,0): apple \u2192 safe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (6,0): empty \u2192 safe.  \nOnly 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n2. UP to (5,2) no apple \u2192 length 4, body: [(5,2),(5,1),(4,1),(3,1)]  \nNext turn from (5,2):  \nUP \u2192 (5,3): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (5,1): body \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (4,2): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (6,2): empty.  \n3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n3. RIGHT to (6,1) no apple \u2192 length 4, body: [(6,1),(5,1),(4,1),(3,1)]  \nNext turn from (6,1):  \nUP \u2192 (6,2): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (6,0): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (5,1): body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7,1): empty.  \n3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan:**  \nDOWN gives immediate apple but traps me with only 2 moves next turn.  \nUP and RIGHT both give 3 safe moves next turn and keep flexibility.  \n\nApple at (5,0) is tempting, but since game is early (turn 13), mobility might be more important. However, enemy snake is length 3, I\u2019m length 4; if I grow to 5, I\u2019ll be safer in potential head-to-heads later. But also, being trapped with 2 moves could be risky if enemy approaches.  \n\nI\u2019ll check enemy\u2019s path: enemy at (8,9) is far away, not an immediate threat. I can afford to take apple now and then maneuver out. From (5,0) next turn, LEFT to (4,0) eats another apple \u2192 length 6, then from (4,0) only safe moves would be LEFT to (3,0) or RIGHT to (5,0) (body), but (3,0) is apple too \u2192 chain-eating possible. That could lead to a long snake quickly but risk trapping myself in bottom row.  \n\nBetter to keep mobility: choose UP or RIGHT. RIGHT moves toward center, UP moves toward top half.  \n\nI prefer RIGHT because it moves toward center and away from my body cluster at left.  \n\n---\n\n**Next turn plan:** From (6,1), apples at (6,6) and (5,0) still accessible. Likely go UP or DOWN next turn toward apples while keeping space.  \n\nRIGHT",

Safe.  \n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (8, 3): my body segment (neck) \u2192 unsafe.  \n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (7, 4): empty, safe.  \n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (9, 4): currently an apple, so safe to move into (eating apple).  \n\nAll safe except DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy snake possible moves from (2, 9):**  \nEnemy body: [(3, 9), (4, 9)].  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 10): out of bounds \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 8): empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 9): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 9): its own body \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo enemy can move DOWN to (2, 8) or LEFT to (1, 9).  \n\n---\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**  \nMy possible moves: (8, 5), (7, 4), (9, 4).  \nEnemy possible moves: (2, 8), (1, 9).  \nNo overlap, so no immediate head-on risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nFrom (8, 4):  \n- (9, 4) distance = 1 (right)  \n- (6, 6) distance = |6-8|+|6-4| = 2+2 = 4  \n- (3, 0) distance = 5+4 = 9  \n- (4, 0) distance = 4+4 = 8  \n- (5, 0) distance = 3+4 = 7  \n\nClosest is (9, 4) \u2192 RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Future mobility after each move:**  \n\n- **UP to (8, 5):**  \n  Next turn possible moves from (8, 5):  \n  UP (8, 6) empty, DOWN (8, 4) empty (but current body at (8, 4) will move forward, so next turn it\u2019s safe), LEFT (7, 5) empty, RIGHT (9, 5) empty. All 4 safe unless enemy moves there.  \n\n- **LEFT to (7, 4):**  \n  Next turn from (7, 4): UP (7, 5), DOWN (7, 3), LEFT (6, 4), RIGHT (8, 4) \u2014 (8, 4) will be empty next turn? Wait, body at (8, 3) moves to (8, 4) if I go LEFT? No, if I go LEFT, my head moves to (7, 4), body follows: new body after move: head (7, 4), then (8, 4) old head, then (8, 3), then (8, 2). So (8, 4) will be my body next turn, so RIGHT from (7, 4) next turn is unsafe. So safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n- **RIGHT to (9, 4):**  \n  Eating apple, grow by 1: new length 5, head at (9, 4), body: (8, 4) old head, (8, 3), (8, 2), (8, 1).  \n  Next turn from (9, 4): UP (9, 5) empty, DOWN (9, 3) empty, LEFT (8, 4) my body \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT OOB unsafe. So only UP and DOWN safe next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Risk assessment:**  \nRIGHT gives immediate apple but puts me on right edge with only 2 safe moves next turn \u2014 riskier.  \nUP keeps central position, 4 safe moves next turn, but doesn\u2019t get apple immediately.  \nLEFT also keeps central, 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nSince apple at (9, 4) is very close, I could get it now with RIGHT, but then I\u2019m trapped on right edge temporarily. However, after growth, my body will occupy (8, 4), so from (9, 4) next turn only UP/DOWN possible. Could be okay if I plan to go UP toward (6, 6) afterward.  \n\nBut enemy is far away, so immediate risk low.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nGet (9, 4) now, then next turn go UP to (9, 5), then LEFT toward middle to avoid trapping on edge. That keeps options open toward (6, 6).  \n\nEating now also increases my lead (4 apples vs enemy 2).  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nRIGHT gets apple safely, no enemy collision risk this turn.  \n\nRIGHT",

My body: (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (8,4) \u2192 not there.  \n   - Not in enemy body?

That\u2019s my current head position, but next turn my body will be: head at (8,7), body: (8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (8,4) \u2192 so (8,6) will be my neck \u2192 suicide. So DOWN not safe next turn.  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (7,7) free? Yes.  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (9,7) free? Yes.  \n  So next turn safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n- **DOWN to (8,5)**:  \n  Next turn body: head at (8,5), body: (8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (8,4) \u2192 (9,5) is body, (8,4) is body.  \n  Check moves:  \n  UP \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 neck \u2192 suicide.  \n  DOWN \u2192 (8,4) \u2192 body \u2192 suicide.  \n  LEFT \u2192 (7,5) \u2192 free.  \n  RIGHT \u2192 (9,5) \u2192 body \u2192 suicide.  \n  So only LEFT safe next turn \u2192 1 option \u2192 risky.  \n\n- **LEFT to (7,6)**:  \n  Next turn body: head at (7,6), body: (8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (8,4)  \n  Check moves:  \n  UP \u2192 (7,7) free.  \n  DOWN \u2192 (7,5) free.  \n  LEFT \u2192 (6,6) free?

(7,1) is near my body cluster right side. (7,3) is above that.  \n\nFrom (6,6):  \n- DOWN gets closer to apples at bottom row, but many steps away.  \n- LEFT gets slightly closer to bottom apples, but still far.  \n- UP moves away from bottom apples but maybe toward (7,3) later.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safe moves after each option:**  \n\n**UP to (6,7):**  \nNext turn safe moves from (6,7): check neighbors:  \n- UP to (6,8): empty.  \n- DOWN to (6,6): currently empty (but my old head will be gone, body moves forward \u2014 tail at (9,4) moves? Let\u2019s simulate: if I move UP now, next turn my body becomes [(6,7), (6,6), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5)], tail (9,5) still present. So (6,6) will be my body segment #2 next turn, so moving DOWN from (6,7) into (6,6) next turn is into own body \u2014 actually, wait: careful: If I move UP now, my new body segments: head (6,7), then old head (6,6) becomes segment 2, then (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5), tail (9,4) disappears (since no apple eaten). So (6,6) will be occupied next turn. Yes. So from (6,7) next turn, DOWN to (6,6) is into own body, unsafe. LEFT to (5,7) empty, RIGHT to (7,7) empty, UP to (6,8) empty. So 3 safe moves next turn if UP now.  \n\n**DOWN to (6,5):**  \nFrom (6,5) next turn:  \n- DOWN to (6,4): empty.  \n- UP to (6,6): occupied (my body segment 2).  \n- LEFT to (5,5): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (7,5): empty? Board shows row 5 col 7 = '.' Yes.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn if DOWN now.  \n\n**LEFT to (5,6):**  \nFrom (5,6) next turn:  \n- LEFT to (4,6): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (6,6): occupied (my body segment 2).  \n- UP to (5,7): empty.  \n- DOWN to (5,5): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn if LEFT now.  \n\nAll three safe moves give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple eating now:**  \nNone of UP, DOWN, LEFT lands on an apple immediately (apples at (3,0),(4,0),(5,0),(7,1),(7,3)). So no growth this turn regardless.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Longer-term positioning:**  \nMy body is mostly on right side (col 6-9). Moving LEFT takes me away from that cluster, opening space on right for later. Moving UP also okay but leaves body trailing behind. Moving DOWN starts heading toward bottom apples but those are far and enemy might go for them too.  \n\nEnemy is far left, might go for bottom apples via RIGHT then DOWN moves. If I go DOWN now, I\u2019m moving toward them but still far.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Avoid potential future trap:**  \nRight now my body blocks (7,6),(8,6),(9,6),(9,5),(9,4). I\u2019m at (6,6). If I go UP, my body next turn will be along col 6 partly, but still okay. If I go LEFT, my body next turn will be at (5,6),(6,6),(7,6), etc. \u2014 this leaves more open space on right for future. That seems good.  \n\nActually, going LEFT now also moves toward the column where apples (3,0)-(5,0) are, though still far.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Choose:**  \nAll three safe moves seem fine short-term. I\u2019ll pick LEFT because it moves toward apples eventually and away from my body cluster, maximizing future options.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter moving to (5,6), consider moving DOWN over several turns toward bottom apples, while watching enemy movement. Keep an eye on apple (7,3) as alternative if enemy heads toward bottom. Avoid boxing self in on right side.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

It also moves away from my body, reducing immediate risk of boxing myself in.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter moving to (3,6), next turn consider DOWN to (3,5) to continue toward apples. Monitor enemy movement \u2014 if enemy moves RIGHT toward (1,3), they\u2019re also heading down eventually, so I might need to race for apples or switch to (7,3) if they get too close to bottom row.

Next turn from (6,5): can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (all likely safe unless enemy moves into them).  \n- **DOWN (6,3)**: moves toward apple at (7,3)? Actually (7,3) is right and up from (6,3), so closer in y but x is off. From (6,3), next moves: UP back to (6,4) (body? no, body currently at (5,4),(4,4)... but careful: by next turn body will have moved forward, so (6,4) might be empty unless I eat apple). Actually, if I don\u2019t eat apple now, next turn head moves, tail moves, so (6,4) becomes empty. So DOWN is safe for future options.  \n- **RIGHT (7,4)**: moves toward apple at (7,3) and (7,1) vertically closer. Next turn from (7,4): can go DOWN to (7,3) for apple, or LEFT, UP, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity:**\n\nApples: (7,3) is 1 step down from (7,4), (7,1) is further down.  \nRIGHT gets me to (7,4), then next turn DOWN to (7,3) for apple. That\u2019s efficient.  \nUP or DOWN don\u2019t get me as directly toward an apple.\n\nAlso, apples at (3,0),(4,0),(5,0) are far away and near enemy maybe, but enemy is at (1,2) so could go for them too.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options / safety:**\n\nFrom (7,4):\n- Next turn: DOWN to (7,3) apple (check if safe then).\n- Also possible: LEFT to (6,4) (empty then), UP to (7,5), RIGHT to (8,4).\n\nFrom (6,5):\n- Next turn: DOWN to (6,4) (empty), LEFT to (5,5), RIGHT to (7,5), UP to (6,6).\n\nFrom (6,3):\n- Next turn: UP to (6,4) (empty), LEFT to (5,3), RIGHT to (7,3) apple, DOWN to (6,2).\n\nAll three safe moves give 3+ options next turn. RIGHT gives me the best immediate progress toward apple (7,3) next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid trapping myself:**\n\nMy body occupies left side (3,4 to 3,6) and (4,4),(5,4). Moving RIGHT keeps me away from my coiled body, opens space.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (7,4), aim for apple at (7,3) next if safe. Keep an eye on enemy snake #1 moving toward bottom apples. Possibly later go for (7,1) after (7,3). Avoid getting pinned in right edge if possible.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the board.\n\n**My snake (ID 0):**  \nHead at (6,0). Body: [(7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (6,4), (5,4)]  \nSo my tail end is at (5,4), head at (6,0).  \n\n**Enemy snake #1:**  \nHead at (1,8), body: [(1,7), (1,6)], length 3.  \n\n**Apples:** (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (1,9), (4,7).  \n\n**Possible moves from (6,0):**  \n- UP \u2192 (6,1): empty? Board shows at (6,1) is '.' (my own body? Wait, check: my body list shows (7,0),(7,1)... No, (6,1) is not in my body list. The board shows column 6 row 1 is '.' according to given ASCII grid? Let's check:  \nRow 1 (y=1): \"1 . . . . . . T . .\" \u2192 (6,1) is 'T'? Wait, row index in board: y=1 row printed second from bottom. Yes:  \nRow 0: \". . . A A A 0 T . .\" \u2192 that's y=0: (6,0) is '0' (my head), (7,0) is 'T' (my body), (5,0) is 'A', (4,0) 'A', (3,0) 'A'.  \nRow 1: \". . . . . . . T . .\" \u2192 so (7,1) is 'T' (my body). (6,1) is '.' (empty).  \nSo UP to (6,1) is empty.  \n\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,-1): off board \u2192 illegal.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,0): contains apple 'A'.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,0): my own body segment (first body segment after head) \u2192 illegal (moving into your own body kills you).  \n\nSo immediately safe moves: UP and LEFT.  \n\n**Enemy snake #1 possible moves from (1,8):**  \nFrom (1,8), body at (1,7),(1,6).  \nPossible: UP\u2192(1,9) apple, DOWN\u2192(1,7) own body (illegal), LEFT\u2192(0,8) empty, RIGHT\u2192(2,8) empty.  \nSo enemy can move UP, LEFT, RIGHT safely. If enemy goes UP to (1,9), eats apple, grows to length 4 (head at (1,9), tail still at (1,6)? Actually growth: new head at apple, old body stays, tail doesn't move that turn).  \n\n**Head-on collision risk:**  \nMy LEFT to (5,0) \u2014 enemy can't reach (5,0) in one move from (1,8), so no head-on risk.  \nMy UP to (6,1) \u2014 enemy can't reach (6,1) in one move.  \n\nSo both UP and LEFT are safe from collisions with enemy head this turn.  \n\n**Future safety:**  \nIf I go LEFT to (5,0): I eat apple, grow to length 9 (currently length 8? Let's count: head + 7 body segments = length 8. Eat apple \u2192 length 9). New head at (5,0), body becomes: new head at (5,0), then old head (6,0) becomes body segment 1, then (7,0),(7,1)... etc. Tail at (5,4)? Wait, my tail is at (5,4), so after eating apple, tail stays at (5,4) this turn, next turn it moves unless apple eaten. Actually growth: new head at apple cell, old body stays, tail does NOT move that turn. So next turn my body will be: head at (5,0), body: (6,0),(7,0),(7,1),(7,2),(7,3),(7,4),(6,4),(5,4) \u2014 length 9.  \n\nThen from (5,0), possible moves: UP (5,1) empty, DOWN off board, LEFT (4,0) apple, RIGHT (6,0) my own body (the old head). So next turn only UP and LEFT safe if apple still at (4,0).  \n\nIf I go UP to (6,1): no apple, length stays 8, head at (6,1), body: (6,0),(7,0),(7,1),(7,2),(7,3),(7,4),(6,4),(5,4). From (6,1), possible moves: UP (6,2) empty, DOWN (6,0) my body, LEFT (5,1) empty, RIGHT (7,1) my body. So three safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Long-term:**  \nEating apples is good to reach 50 apples to win. But must avoid dead ends. Currently apples at (3,0),(4,0),(5,0) are clustered at bottom row. My tail is at (5,4), so bottom row might be risky later if I fill it with body.  \n\nGoing LEFT to (5,0) eats apple, but then I'm at (5,0) with only UP and LEFT safe next turn if apple at (4,0) still there (enemy might take it). If enemy takes (1,9) apple, they grow but far away.  \n\nActually, going LEFT to (5,0) seems fine: I get an apple, increase score to 8, still have UP and LEFT next turn, and (4,0) apple is close.  \n\nGoing UP to (6,1) gives more flexibility but delays eating.  \n\nGiven my length 8 vs enemy length 3, I'm much longer, so I can afford to be slightly less aggressive, but eating is still priority.  \n\nI think LEFT is better: eat apple now, stay near other apples.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (5,0), if apple at (4,0) still there, eat it; otherwise go UP to (5,1) to open space. Avoid trapping myself in bottom row if tail blocks.  \n\nFinal move:  \nLEFT",

Checking ASCII grid: row 1 (y=1) column 5 is '.' \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,-1): off board \u2192 illegal.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,0): contains apple 'A'.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,0): my own body segment (second segment) \u2192 illegal.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT.  \n\n**Enemy possible moves from (1,9):**  \nFrom (1,9): body at (1,8),(1,7),(1,6).  \nPossible: DOWN\u2192(1,8) own body \u2192 illegal, LEFT\u2192(0,9) empty, RIGHT\u2192(2,9) apple, UP\u2192(1,10) off board illegal.  \nSo enemy can move LEFT or RIGHT safely.  \n\n**Head-on collision risk:**  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (2,9), that\u2019s far from me. If enemy moves LEFT to (0,9), also far. No overlap with my possible moves (5,1) or (4,0).  \n\n**Growth consideration:**  \nIf I go LEFT to (4,0), I eat apple, grow to length 10, tail stays at (5,4) this turn.  \nIf I go UP to (5,1), no apple eaten.  \n\n**Future safety after each move:**  \n\n1. **LEFT to (4,0)**: eat apple \u2192 head at (4,0). Next turn from (4,0): UP (4,1) empty, DOWN off board, LEFT (3,0) apple, RIGHT (5,0) my body (old head). So safe moves would be UP and LEFT again. That could trap me along bottom row if I keep eating apples there, but my tail is at (5,4) so bottom row not blocked yet. However, after eating (3,0) next turn, I\u2019d be at (3,0) with only UP safe (since LEFT (2,0) empty but DOWN off, RIGHT (4,0) body). That\u2019s risky.  \n\n2. **UP to (5,1)**: head at (5,1), no growth. Next turn from (5,1): UP (5,2) empty, DOWN (5,0) my body, LEFT (4,1) empty, RIGHT (6,1) empty. Three safe moves, more flexibility.  \n\nGiven I\u2019m already length 9 vs enemy length 4, I have a big lead (8 apples vs 3). I don\u2019t need to greedily eat apples if it reduces future safe moves. Going LEFT to (4,0) would lead to a possible dead end at (3,0) next turn (only UP safe). That\u2019s dangerous because if enemy moves into my path later, I could get trapped.  \n\nBetter to keep options open: UP to (5,1) gives more space and I can later go towards (0,4) or (4,7) apples safely.  \n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nFrom (5,1), consider moving toward (0,4) via left/up to collect distant apples while keeping away from enemy. Avoid bottom row now unless necessary.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Body: [(5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4)].  \nSo my tail is at (7, 4), length 9 segments (head + 8 body).  \n\n**Apples:** (3,0), (4,0), (4,7), (0,4), (8,7).  \n\n**Enemy snake #1:** Head at (3,9), body: [(2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (1,7)], length 5 segments.  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Possible moves from (5,2):\n- **UP** \u2192 (5,3)  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 occupied by my body \u2192 illegal  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4,2)  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,2)  \n\nSo DOWN is eliminated immediately (into own body).  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Check remaining moves for immediate death:\n\n**UP to (5,3):**  \nBoard shows at (5,3) is empty ('.'). Not off board, not my body (body at (5,1), (5,0), etc.), not enemy body (enemy body at (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), far away). Safe.  \n\n**LEFT to (4,2):**  \nEmpty on board. Not my body. Safe.  \n\n**RIGHT to (6,2):**  \nEmpty on board. Not my body. Safe.  \n\nAll three are safe from *static* obstacles.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Consider enemy's possible moves and head-on collisions:\n\nEnemy head at (3,9). Their possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (3,10) \u2192 off board \u2192 illegal  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,8) \u2192 empty on board  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,9) \u2192 occupied by their body (their own segment) \u2192 illegal  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,9) \u2192 empty  \n\nSo enemy can only move DOWN or RIGHT from (3,9).  \n\nNow, could they move into the same cell I move into?  \nIf I go UP to (5,3): enemy can't reach (5,3) in 1 move (they are at (3,9)), so no head-on collision.  \nIf I go LEFT to (4,2): enemy can't reach (4,2) in 1 move.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (6,2): enemy can't reach (6,2).  \n\nSo no risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Future safety / options after each move:\n\n**UP to (5,3):**  \nFrom (5,3), possible moves next turn: UP (5,4), DOWN (5,2), LEFT (4,3), RIGHT (6,3).  \nDOWN (5,2) is currently empty (my old head location will be empty after I move unless enemy moves there, but enemy far away). So likely 4 options open next turn.  \nCloser to apple at (0,4) or (4,7)? Not really closer to (4,7) than now; but moving up opens central area.  \n\n**LEFT to (4,2):**  \nFrom (4,2), next moves: UP (4,3), DOWN (4,1), LEFT (3,2), RIGHT (5,2).  \nDOWN (4,1) is empty now. All seem safe next turn except if something moves there.  \nCloser to apples at (3,0) or (4,0), but those are near my body segments (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), etc., risky because my own body blocks area below. Actually (4,1) is free, (4,0) is apple but (4,0) is adjacent to my body at (5,0) and (6,0)? Wait, my body at (5,0), (6,0), (7,0) \u2014 so (4,0) is free but next to my body, not part of it. But going for apple (4,0) would require going to (4,1) then (4,0), but (4,0) is adjacent horizontally to my body at (5,0) \u2014 that\u2019s fine. However, if I go LEFT now to (4,2), then next turn I could go DOWN to (4,1), then DOWN to (4,0) apple. That\u2019s a possible short path.  \n\n**RIGHT to (6,2):**  \nFrom (6,2), next moves: UP (6,3), DOWN (6,1), LEFT (5,2), RIGHT (7,2).  \nDOWN (6,1) is empty, LEFT is old head position empty, UP empty, RIGHT (7,2) is my body currently \u2014 but by next turn my body will have moved? Wait, my body moves forward only when I eat an apple. I didn\u2019t eat apple this turn, so my tail stays at (7,4), body shifts: head moves to new spot, each segment moves into previous segment\u2019s position. So (7,2) currently my body segment, but next turn segment at (7,2) will move to (7,3)? Let\u2019s check: My body: head (5,2) \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 (5,0) \u2192 (6,0) \u2192 (7,0) \u2192 (7,1) \u2192 (7,2) \u2192 (7,3) \u2192 (7,4) tail. If I move RIGHT to (6,2), new head at (6,2), then body becomes: (6,2) head, then old head (5,2) becomes new neck, then (5,1), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), tail (7,4) drops off? Wait, no growth, so tail (7,4) disappears, segment at (7,3) moves to (7,4)? Actually: total length 9 segments. After move without eating: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves forward one along path, last segment (tail) leaves its cell. So (7,4) vacated, (7,3) moves to (7,4), (7,2) moves to (7,3), etc. So (7,2) will be empty next turn. So RIGHT to (6,2) is safe now and opens future options.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Apples proximity:\n\nClosest apples to my head (5,2):  \n- (4,0) dist |5-4|+|2-0|=3  \n- (3,0) dist |5-3|+|2-0|=4  \n- (0,4) dist 7  \n- (4,7) dist |5-4|+|2-7|=6  \n- (8,7) dist 8  \n\nLEFT (4,2) gets me closer to (4,0) and (3,0). UP gets me slightly closer to (0,4) and (4,7). RIGHT gets me slightly closer to (8,7) but farther from others.  \n\nSince I have a lead (8 vs 4 apples), maybe avoid risky low apples near my own body coils. (4,0) is adjacent to my body at (5,0) horizontally, but that\u2019s fine unless I trap myself.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Long-term flexibility:\n\nMy body occupies bottom row from (5,0) to (7,0) and column x=7 from y=0 to y=4. That creates a partial barrier on right side. Moving LEFT opens more space (left side board less cluttered with my body). Moving RIGHT goes toward my own body wall \u2014 could limit options later.  \n\nBest for future options: UP or LEFT.  \n\nUP \u2192 more central, away from my body.  \nLEFT \u2192 toward left side apples but also toward enemy? Enemy is at top left far away.  \n\n---\n\n### 7. Plan for next few turns:\n\nI\u2019ll aim to eventually collect apples (0,4) or (4,7) while avoiding boxing myself. Right now, UP seems safe and keeps me centered with many escape routes. LEFT also safe but puts me closer to bottom apples which might force me into tighter space near my body.  \n\nGiven my long body, I need to avoid circling myself. UP seems to give most freedom.  \n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan:** Move UP to (5,3), then assess from there. Possibly head toward (4,7) apple via (5,4), (5,5), etc., or toward (0,4) via leftward moves, but keep space to maneuver. Avoid enemy head collisions in future by tracking enemy possible moves each turn.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

Space and long-term path:**\nMy body occupies bottom row (5,0)-(7,0), column x=7 from y=0 to y=2, and column x=5 from y=0 to y=3. Moving LEFT toward (4, 4) puts me near left side where fewer body obstacles but also fewer apples except low ones. Moving UP opens central area and top apples. Moving RIGHT (6, 4) is near my body wall at x=7, could limit future moves.\n\nGiven I have a big lead (8 apples vs enemy 4), I should play safe, keep space open, and aim for apples without risking entrapment.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\nMove UP toward apple (4, 7) while staying in open center. Avoid boxing myself near my own body. After UP, consider moving toward (4, 7) via LEFT or UP again, but check enemy position (enemy is far north, unlikely to interfere soon).\n\n---\n\nUP",

Possible moves from (4, 5):**  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 6)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 4)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 5)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 5) \u2192 occupied by my body \u2192 illegal  \n\nSo RIGHT is eliminated immediately.  \n\n---\n\n**2. Immediate safety check:**  \nUP (4, 6): empty.  \nDOWN (4, 4): empty.  \nLEFT (3, 5): empty.  \n\nAll three are safe from static obstacles (walls, my body, enemy body).  \n\n---\n\n**3. Enemy collision risk this turn:**  \nEnemy at (4, 8). Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 9) occupied by its body \u2192 illegal  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 7) empty (apple there)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 8) empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 8) occupied by its body \u2192 illegal  \n\nCould enemy move into same cell as me this turn?  \nIf I go UP (4, 6): enemy can't reach (4, 6) in one move.  \nIf I go DOWN (4, 4): enemy can't reach.  \nIf I go LEFT (3, 5): enemy can't reach.  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Future safety after each move:**  \n\n**UP to (4, 6):**  \nNext turn moves from (4, 6): UP (4, 7) \u2013 currently apple, enemy could also go there this turn (enemy DOWN from (4, 8) \u2192 (4, 7)). That means if enemy goes DOWN this turn, enemy will be at (4, 7) next turn, and I would move into (4, 7) next turn \u2192 head-on collision.  \nBut enemy might not go DOWN (it could go LEFT to (3, 8) instead). Still, risky if enemy goes for apple.  \n\n**DOWN to (4, 4):**  \nNext turn moves from (4, 4): UP (4, 5) empty, DOWN (4, 3) empty, LEFT (3, 4) empty, RIGHT (5, 4) occupied by my body (but my body will move forward, so (5, 4) will be empty next turn? Wait, my tail is at (7,0), so after this move, my body will be: head at (4,4), then (4,5), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0) \u2014 actually (5,4) is still occupied next turn because it's the 4th segment. So RIGHT from (4,4) next turn would be illegal. So DOWN reduces future options a bit.  \n\n**LEFT to (3, 5):**  \nNext turn moves from (3, 5): UP (3, 6) empty, DOWN (3, 4) empty, LEFT (2, 5) empty, RIGHT (4, 5) empty next turn. All four safe next turn. Good flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Apple proximity:**  \nFrom (4, 5):  \n- (4, 7): dist 2  \n- (0, 4): dist 5  \n- (8, 7): dist 6  \n- (3, 0): dist 6  \n- (4, 0): dist 5  \n\nClosest apple: (4, 7) dist 2.  \nUP gets me closer (to (4, 7)) but risks head-on if enemy goes DOWN this turn.  \nLEFT gets me toward (0, 4) and (3, 0) but not closer to (4, 7).  \nDOWN gets me closer to (4, 0) and (3, 0).  \n\n---\n\n**6. Enemy proximity:**  \nEnemy at (4, 8). If I go UP to (4, 6), enemy could go DOWN to (4, 7), then we're adjacent vertically. That's risky for next turn head-on if I go UP again.  \nSafer to avoid moving directly toward enemy when I have a lead (8 vs 4 apples).  \n\n---\n\n**7. Long-term space:**  \nMy body occupies bottom-left region, especially column x=5 from y=0 to y=5, plus bottom row x=6,7. Moving LEFT opens less-crowded left side. Moving UP toward enemy and apple is tempting but dangerous.  \n\nGiven the risk of enemy going for (4, 7), I should let enemy possibly take it while I aim for other apples safely.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan:**  \nAvoid head-on risk with enemy. LEFT to (3, 5) keeps distance, opens more space, and allows future moves toward apples (0, 4) or (3, 0) safely.  \n\nLEFT",

Neither threatens my immediate safe cells this turn.

The apple at (0,4) is tempting, but going LEFT (1,5) then maybe next turn DOWN (1,4) gets apple (0,4)? Actually (0,4) is left of (1,4), so need LEFT from (1,4) to (0,4) to eat it. That\u2019s fine.  \n\nIf I go DOWN (2,4) now, then LEFT (1,4) next turn, then LEFT (0,4) to eat apple. Same number of moves to apple.  \n\nBut DOWN reduces future options more than LEFT or UP.  \n\n---\n\n**Tiebreaker:** Which move keeps more space?  \nLEFT (1,5) \u2192 near left wall (x=0) soon, could limit horizontal movement later.  \nUP (2,6) \u2192 more central, more options.  \n\nApple at (6,5) is also reachable later from central area.  \n\nGiven my length 9 vs enemy length 6, I can afford to be slightly less aggressive on apples and more focused on survival/open space.  \n\nUP seems best for keeping options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (2,6), consider moving toward apple (6,5) or (8,7) while avoiding enemy path. Enemy likely heading toward (8,7) apple from (5,7) via RIGHT then DOWN or DOWN then RIGHT. Keep distance.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Enemy possible moves:  \n- UP (8, 8) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN (8, 6) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT (7, 7) \u2013 its own body (second segment), illegal.  \n- RIGHT (9, 7) \u2013 in bounds, empty.\n\nNone of my three safe moves can be reached by enemy in one move (distance > 1). So all three are safe from enemy head collision this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Future mobility from each move:**  \n\nFrom UP (2, 9): next moves: UP (out of bounds), DOWN (2, 8) my body, LEFT (1, 9), RIGHT (3, 9) \u2192 only 2 safe moves next turn, and top row limits options.\n\nFrom LEFT (1, 8): next moves: UP (1, 9), DOWN (1, 7) my body, LEFT (0, 8), RIGHT (2, 8) body \u2192 2 safe moves.\n\nFrom RIGHT (3, 8): next moves: UP (3, 9), DOWN (3, 7) empty, LEFT (2, 8) body, RIGHT (4, 8) empty \u2192 2 safe moves.\n\nSo UP gives 2 safe next moves, but going to top row reduces options afterward. LEFT and RIGHT also give 2 safe next moves.\n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nFrom (2, 8):  \n- Apple (0, 4): distance |2\u22120|+|8\u22124| = 2+4 = 6  \n- Apple (6, 5): |2\u22126|+|8\u22125| = 4+3 = 7  \n- Apple (6, 4): |2\u22126|+|8\u22124| = 4+4 = 8  \n- Apples at (3,0),(4,0): far.\n\nLEFT (1, 8) gets slightly closer to (0, 4) (distance 5).  \nRIGHT (3, 8) gets slightly closer to (6, 5) and (6, 4).  \nUP (2, 9) moves away from all apples.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy prediction:**  \nEnemy likely goes UP (8, 8) or RIGHT (9, 7) to avoid walls and possibly plan for apples (6, 5)/(6, 4) later. If enemy goes UP to (8, 8), it's farther from me. If enemy goes RIGHT to (9, 7), it's near right wall.\n\nI should avoid moving toward enemy since I'm longer (9 vs 6) and head-on collision kills both. Staying central-left seems safe.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI want to eventually collect apples at (0, 4) and (6, 5)/(6, 4), but enemy may aim for (6, 5)/(6, 4). Going LEFT sets up a path down toward (0, 4) while staying away from enemy. From (1, 8), next turn could go LEFT (0, 8) then DOWN toward apple (0, 4) over several moves. This keeps me in open space with options.\n\nRIGHT (3, 8) moves toward center where enemy might come for apples, increasing collision risk. UP (2, 9) traps me along top edge.\n\nLEFT looks best for safety and apple path.\n\nLEFT",

That puts it closer to my position if I go LEFT (0, 7) or DOWN (1, 6).  \n\nBut more importantly, if enemy moves LEFT to (6, 8), then next turn it could go DOWN to (6, 7) (its body? No, (6, 7) is enemy body currently \u2014 wait, enemy body: (8,8), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7). Yes, (6, 7) is its body, so from (6, 8) enemy\u2019s DOWN is blocked. So enemy might go LEFT to (5, 8) or UP to (6, 9) from (6, 8).  \n\nActually, from (7, 8), enemy\u2019s only safe moves are UP or LEFT. LEFT to (6, 8) is safe and puts it closer to apples at (6, 5)/(6, 4). Likely enemy will go LEFT.\n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (6, 8), distance to me:  \nMe at (1, 6): 5+2=7  \nMe at (0, 7): 6+1=7  \nSame.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI want to collect (0, 4) apple. From (1, 6), I can go LEFT to (0, 6), then DOWN to (0, 5), then DOWN to (0, 4). That\u2019s 3 moves to apple. From (0, 7), I\u2019d go DOWN to (0, 6), then DOWN to (0, 5), then DOWN to (0, 4) \u2014 also 3 moves.  \n\nBut being at (1, 6) keeps me more central, slightly safer from being trapped against left wall if enemy approaches later.  \n\nAlso, enemy might go for (6, 5)/(6, 4), so staying west (left side) is safer.\n\nLEFT (0, 7) puts me on edge with fewer horizontal options next turn (only UP/DOWN). DOWN (1, 6) keeps x=1, still near left but not on edge, same apple distance, same safe moves next turn.\n\nI think DOWN is slightly better for future flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 6), go LEFT toward (0, 4) apple unless enemy blocks path. Keep an eye on enemy moving toward (6, 5).\n\nDOWN",

Wait: If I eat apple, I grow by 1 segment at the end of next movement. Actually, growth happens after move, so at the start of next turn my body will be [(0,4), (1,4), (1,5), \u2026 (2,5)] with new segment added at tail. But (0,5) is currently empty, and after growth my tail is at (2,5) original tail, so (0,5) is free. Let\u2019s check: current body after move without growth: head to (0,4), rest follow: body becomes [(0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5)] \u2014 wait that\u2019s length 10? No, I have 8 body segments now, head moves to (0,4), body shifts: new body = [(0,4)] + old body[:-1]. Old body = [(1,5), (1,6), \u2026, (2,5)] (8 cells). So new body = [(0,4), (1,5), (1,6), \u2026, (2,6), (2,5)? Let\u2019s list carefully:  \nCurrent: head (1,4), body[0]=(1,5), body[1]=(1,6), body[2]=(1,7), body[3]=(1,8), body[4]=(2,8), body[5]=(2,7), body[6]=(2,6), body[7]=(2,5).  \nMove LEFT to (0,4) and eat apple \u2192 growth next turn, but for next turn\u2019s possible moves, the body after move but before growth is: head (0,4), body segments shift: segment1 = old head (1,4), segment2 = old body[0] (1,5), segment3 = old body[1] (1,6), \u2026, segment9 = old body[7] (2,5). So body = [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5)]. Length 9 body + head total 10.  \nNow check next turn from (0,4): UP (0,5): free. DOWN (0,3): free. LEFT out of bounds. RIGHT (1,4): occupied by my body segment1 \u2192 illegal. So 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN).\n\n2. **DOWN to (1, 3):**  \nFrom (1, 3): UP (1,4) occupied by my body segment1 after move? After move without growth: head (1,3), body = [(1,4), (1,5), \u2026, (2,5)].  \nSo moves: UP (1,4) my body \u2192 no. DOWN (1,2) free. LEFT (0,3) free. RIGHT (2,3) free. So 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (2, 4):**  \nFrom (2, 4): body after move = [(1,4), (1,5), \u2026, (2,5) with last segment removed? Wait length same: body = [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5)].  \nCheck: UP (2,5) my body segment9 \u2192 illegal. DOWN (2,3) free. LEFT (1,4) my body segment1 \u2192 illegal. RIGHT (3,4) free. So 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT).\n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nFrom (1,4): apple at (0,4) distance 1 LEFT, apples at (3,0) and (4,0) far, apples at (6,5),(6,4) far.  \nLEFT gets apple immediately. DOWN and RIGHT don\u2019t get apple this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Risk evaluation:**  \nLEFT: gets apple, grows, but next turn only 2 safe moves (UP/DOWN), and I\u2019m on left edge. Could be risky if enemy approaches later, but enemy is far.  \nDOWN: no apple, but 3 safe moves next turn, keeps central.  \nRIGHT: no apple, 2 safe moves, slightly better than LEFT\u2019s future options? Actually RIGHT next turn only DOWN/RIGHT safe.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy likely to go toward apples (6,5) or (6,4) by moving DOWN or RIGHT from (5,7). If enemy moves RIGHT to (6,7), closer to those apples. If DOWN to (5,6), also closer. Not an immediate threat to me.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI want to collect apples safely. (0,4) is free and safe to take now. Taking it gives me +1 apple (9 total) and extends my lead over enemy (6 apples). After eating, I\u2019ll have more length, which could help in trapping enemy later. My immediate safety is fine.  \n\nFrom (0,4) after eating, I can go DOWN to (0,3) next turn to avoid being trapped on left edge, then possibly move toward bottom apples (3,0),(4,0).\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nLEFT gets apple safely, increases score lead, and next turn still has escape routes. Better than DOWN/RIGHT which delay eating.\n\nLEFT",

They might go for apple at (6,5) or (6,4), but (6,4) is two steps away.  \n\nOur safe moves:  \n\n**RIGHT to (1,3):**  \n- Not adjacent to enemy head now, and enemy can\u2019t reach (1,3) in 1 move from (6,6).  \n- No immediate head-on collision risk.  \n- Next turn from (1,3) I could go UP (1,4) but that\u2019s my body currently moving away, maybe safe later.  \n- But from (1,3), possible moves next turn: UP (1,4) currently occupied by my body segment (0,4) might move away? Wait, my body segments move only if I move. Actually, if I move RIGHT now, my head goes to (1,3), my whole body shifts: new body will be [(1,3), (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), \u2026]. Let\u2019s check carefully:  \n\nCurrent body: head (0,3), then (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), \u2026 tail (2,6).  \nIf I move RIGHT to (1,3): new head at (1,3), then old head (0,3) becomes segment 2, then old segment 2 (0,4) becomes segment 3, etc. So (0,4) becomes 3rd segment, (1,4) becomes 4th segment.  \n\nSo next turn from (1,3), UP to (1,4) would be into my own body (4th segment) \u2192 not safe next turn. DOWN to (1,2) safe, LEFT to (0,3) safe (old head position now empty? No, (0,3) becomes my 2nd segment after this move, so next turn moving LEFT from (1,3) to (0,3) would be into myself \u2192 not safe). So from (1,3) next turn only DOWN and RIGHT possibly safe. That\u2019s limiting.  \n\n**DOWN to (0,2):**  \nFrom (0,2), possible moves next turn: UP back to (0,3) (my 2nd segment), not safe. DOWN to (0,1) safe, LEFT off board, RIGHT to (1,2) safe. So two safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apples proximity:**  \nApples: (3,0), (4,0), (6,5), (6,4), (3,8).  \nFrom (0,3):  \n- DOWN to (0,2) \u2192 closer to bottom apples (3,0),(4,0). Manhattan distance to (3,0) from (0,2)=|3-0|+|0-2|=3+2=5.  \n- RIGHT to (1,3) \u2192 distance to (3,0)=|3-1|+|0-3|=2+3=5 same actually. But (1,3) is farther from (4,0)? Actually (4,0) from (1,3)=|4-1|+|0-3|=3+3=6, from (0,2)=|4-0|+|0-2|=4+2=6 same.  \n\nSo both equally distant from bottom apples.  \n\nBut (0,2) is closer to board edge (left wall), which could limit future options unless I go right soon. But (0,2) has RIGHT option next turn to (1,2), then could go to (2,2), etc., opening path.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Avoid enemy collision possibilities:**  \nEnemy at (6,6) can\u2019t reach my possible next head positions (0,2) or (1,3) in 1 move. So no head-on risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Which is better long-term?**  \nFrom (0,2):  \n- Next turn safe: DOWN to (0,1), RIGHT to (1,2).  \n- From (1,2): opens more central options.  \n\nFrom (1,3):  \n- Next turn safe: only DOWN to (1,2) and RIGHT to (2,3) maybe? Wait check: from (1,3) after this move:  \nBody segments: (1,3) head, (0,3) segment2, (0,4) segment3, (1,4) segment4, (1,5) segment5, \u2026  \nSo (2,3) is empty now (board shows empty at (2,3)), so RIGHT to (2,3) is safe next turn. Actually yes, so from (1,3) next turn safe: DOWN (1,2), RIGHT (2,3). So also 2 safe moves.  \n\nSo both give 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\nBut DOWN to (0,2) keeps me near bottom edge but closer to apples (3,0),(4,0) in fewer moves if I go right after. Also, enemy is far away top-right.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Plan for future turns:**  \nI want to target apples at (3,0) and (4,0) while avoiding trapping myself. Going DOWN now to (0,2) then next turn RIGHT to (1,2) then to (2,2) then up/down toward apples seems safe.  \n\nRIGHT now to (1,3) then DOWN to (1,2) also reaches similar path but delays by 1 turn.  \n\nGiven my body occupies (0,4),(1,4), etc., staying low might avoid running into my own body soon.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nI\u2019ll go DOWN to (0,2) to start moving toward bottom apples while keeping options open.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (0,2), go RIGHT next turn to (1,2), then to (2,2), then head toward (3,0) apple, watching enemy movement.  \n\nDOWN",

They might also go LEFT or RIGHT to avoid danger.  \n\nFrom (6, 5), they cannot reach my possible next head positions (0, 1) or (1, 2) in one move, so no immediate head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nFrom (0, 2):  \n- DOWN to (0, 1): closer to bottom apples (3, 0) and (4, 0). Manhattan distance to (3, 0) = 4.  \n- RIGHT to (1, 2): distance to (3, 0) = 4 as well.  \n\nBut from (1, 2) next turn I could go DOWN to (1, 1) then RIGHT toward apples, or RIGHT to (2, 2). From (0, 1) next turn I could go RIGHT to (1, 1) similarly.  \n\nThe apple at (3, 4) is closer from (1, 2) than from (0, 1), but (3, 4) is surrounded? Checking board: (3, 4) is empty except maybe enemy path.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future move options:**  \nFrom (0, 1) next turn:  \nUP to (0, 2) \u2192 my body will be at (0, 2)? Wait, after moving DOWN to (0, 1), my body shifts: new head (0, 1), then (0, 2) becomes segment 2 (old head), then (0, 3) segment 3, etc. So UP next turn would be into myself. So from (0, 1) next turn safe moves: DOWN to (0, 0), RIGHT to (1, 1). That\u2019s only 2 options, one is along bottom edge.  \n\nFrom (1, 2) next turn:  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (1, 2), body: head (1, 2), then (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), \u2026  \nSafe moves from (1, 2): UP (1, 3) is empty? Yes, board shows (1, 3) empty now. DOWN (1, 1) empty. LEFT (0, 2) is my body segment 2 \u2192 not safe. RIGHT (2, 2) empty.  \nSo from (1, 2) next turn: UP, DOWN, RIGHT \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nThat\u2019s better mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Avoid trapping:**  \nGoing DOWN to (0, 1) reduces future options more than RIGHT to (1, 2). Since I want to keep flexibility and eventually target apples (3, 0) or (3, 4), starting to move right opens more central paths.  \n\nAlso, enemy might eat (6, 4) apple soon, but I\u2019m far from it, so not competing immediately.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nFrom (1, 2), next turn consider going RIGHT to (2, 2) to approach apples at (3, 0) or (3, 4) while avoiding my long body along top rows. Keep checking enemy head movement to avoid head-on collisions. If enemy goes DOWN to (6, 4), they\u2019ll grow and possibly block that area; I\u2019ll focus on bottom left apples first.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT gives more next-turn options and starts moving toward apples while staying safe.  \n\nRIGHT",

Yes, (6, 5) is in enemy body \u2192 not safe.  \nDOWN (6, 3) \u2192 empty.  \nLEFT (5, 4) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT (7, 4) \u2192 empty but has apple at (8, 4) nearby.  \n\nEnemy could go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \nThey might go RIGHT toward apple (8, 4) or LEFT toward center.  \nThey could also go DOWN to (6, 3) to avoid my path.  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk because enemy is far away (Manhattan distance 5 from my head).\n\n---\n\n**3. Apple targeting:**  \nFrom (1, 2):  \n- UP (1, 3): moves away from bottom apples (3,0), (4,0) but closer to (3,4) and (3,8).  \n- DOWN (1, 1): closer to bottom apples.  \n- RIGHT (2, 2): closer to (3,4) and still can go down later for bottom apples.\n\n---\n\n**4.

Long-term:**  \nI want to target apples while keeping mobility. UP is eliminated due to next-turn trap.  \nBetween DOWN and RIGHT:  \nDOWN heads toward bottom apples (3,0)/(4,0) and keeps good mobility.  \nRIGHT heads toward (3,4) and also keeps good mobility.\n\nEnemy might go for (8, 4) apple or (3, 4).

Decision:**  \nUP is unsafe next turn.  \nDOWN and RIGHT both safe and keep options open.  \nRIGHT puts me closer to (3, 4) apple which is nearer than bottom apples (Manhattan distance from (2, 2) to (3, 4) = 3, from (1, 1) to (3, 0) = 3 as well). But from (2, 2) I can also go DOWN afterward toward bottom apples if needed.  \nAlso, enemy might eat (3, 4) if I delay, so moving toward it now seems good.\n\nI choose **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (2, 2), consider moving RIGHT toward (3, 4) apple if enemy not blocking, else go DOWN toward (3, 0). Keep checking enemy head movement to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy possible moves from (6, 3):**  \nEnemy safe moves:  \nUP (6, 4) \u2192 enemy\u2019s body segment \u2192 no.  \nDOWN (6, 2) \u2192 empty.  \nLEFT (5, 3) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT (7, 3) \u2192 empty.  \nEnemy could go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nEnemy is far (Manhattan distance 4 from my head), no immediate head-on risk.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Apple targeting:**  \nFrom (2, 2):  \n- UP (2, 3): gets closer to (3,4) (Manhattan distance 2) and (3,8).  \n- DOWN (2, 1): gets closer to (3,0) and (4,0).  \n- RIGHT (3, 2): gets closer to (3,4) (distance 2) and also closer to bottom apples if go down later.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Future move options:**  \nCheck mobility after each safe move:  \n\n**UP to (2, 3):**  \nNext turn neighbors:  \nUP (2, 4): empty.  \nDOWN (2, 2): my body \u2192 no.  \nLEFT (1, 3): empty.  \nRIGHT (3, 3): empty.  \nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT \u2192 good mobility.  \n\n**DOWN to (2, 1):**  \nNext turn neighbors:  \nUP (2, 2): my body \u2192 no.  \nDOWN (2, 0): empty.  \nLEFT (1, 1): empty.  \nRIGHT (3, 1): empty.  \nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2192 good mobility.  \n\n**RIGHT to (3, 2):**  \nNext turn neighbors:  \nUP (3, 3): empty.  \nDOWN (3, 1): empty.  \nLEFT (2, 2): my body \u2192 no.  \nRIGHT (4, 2): empty.  \nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT \u2192 good mobility.  \n\nAll three keep options open.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Apple priority:**  \nClosest apples to me now:  \n- (3,4) distance 3 from (2,2)  \n- (3,0) distance 3 from (2,2)  \n- (4,0) distance 4 from (2,2)  \n\nEnemy might target (3,4) from (6,3) \u2014 they are 5 away, I\u2019m 3 away, but they could move LEFT twice toward it.  \nIf I go RIGHT now to (3,2), I\u2019m 2 away from (3,4) next turn (UP twice).  \nIf I go UP now to (2,3), also 2 away next turn (RIGHT then UP).  \nIf I go DOWN now, I\u2019m moving away from (3,4) but toward bottom apples.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Avoid dead ends:**  \nMy body occupies left column (0,y) from y=2 to y=4 and right side (1,y) from y=4 to y=8 \u2014 so area around (1,3)-(1,4) is blocked for me.  \nFrom (2,3), going LEFT next turn to (1,3) is blocked by my body at (1,4)? Wait, (1,3) is empty now, but (1,4) is my body, so (1,3) is free. Actually checking: my body list: (1,2) is body, (0,2),(0,3),(0,4),(1,4)... so (1,3) is empty. Yes. So LEFT from (2,3) is safe next turn.  \n\nAll safe moves keep mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**7. Decision:**  \nEnemy is not an immediate threat.  \nI want to secure (3,4) before enemy does.  \nRIGHT puts me at (3,2) \u2014 next turn I can go UP to (3,3) then UP to (3,4).  \nUP puts me at (2,3) \u2014 next turn I can go RIGHT to (3,3) then UP to (3,4).  \nBoth require 2 moves to reach apple.  \n\nBut RIGHT also opens path to bottom apples if I go DOWN later.  \nUP risks being closer to enemy if they move toward (3,4) from left? Enemy is to my right, so UP from (2,3) is actually away from enemy.  \n\nActually, enemy at (6,3) could go LEFT (5,3) then LEFT (4,3) then LEFT (3,3) \u2014 3 moves to (3,3). I can be at (3,2) in 1 move, then (3,3) in 2 moves, tie? Wait, they move same turn as me.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT now to (3,2), enemy could go LEFT twice to (4,3) then (3,3) \u2014 they\u2019d reach (3,3) in 2 moves, I\u2019d reach (3,3) in 2 moves (RIGHT then UP). But if they go LEFT three times to (3,3), they\u2019d be there turn 63 same time as me if I go RIGHT then UP \u2014 possible head-on collision at (3,3) turn 63.  \n\nIf I go UP now to (2,3), then RIGHT to (3,3) turn 63 \u2014 same risk if enemy goes LEFT thrice.  \n\nBetter to go DOWN toward bottom apples which enemy is farther from.  \n\n---\n\n**8. Final choice:**  \nDOWN to (2,1) targets (3,0) and (4,0), avoids possible fight over (3,4) with enemy who might be heading there. Keeps options open.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (2,1), consider moving LEFT to (1,1) then DOWN to (1,0) then RIGHT toward (3,0) apple, or go directly RIGHT to (3,1) then DOWN to (3,0). Monitor enemy movement toward (3,4).  \n\nDOWN",

Apples are at (3, 0), (4, 0), (3, 8), (3, 4), (8, 4). Enemy snake is at (3, 1) with body at (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6). I have 8 apples, enemy has 9.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n*   **UP:** (5, 5) - Safe.\n*   **DOWN:** (5, 3) - Safe.\n*   **LEFT:** (4, 4) - Safe.\n*   **RIGHT:** (6, 4) - Not safe, would collide with my body.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3, 1). Possible moves for the enemy:\n*   **UP:** (3, 2)\n*   **DOWN:** (3, 0) - Apple!\n*   **LEFT:** (2, 1)\n*   **RIGHT:** (4, 1)\n\nI want to move towards (3, 0), (4, 0), (3, 8), (3, 4), or (8, 4).\n\nUP moves me to (5,5), which is safe. DOWN moves me to (5,3), which is safe. LEFT moves me to (4,4), which is safe. RIGHT is not safe.\n\nLooking ahead, I want to get to the apples at (3,0) and (4,0). Moving DOWN gets me closer to those apples. Moving UP gets me closer to (3,4) and (3,8). Moving LEFT gets me closer to (3,4) and (3,8).\n\nThe enemy is likely to go down and grab an apple. I should prioritize getting apples to catch up to the enemy. I think moving DOWN is a good option to get closer to the apples at (3,0) and (4,0).\n\nStrategy note for next turn: Continue moving towards apples. The enemy is still relatively close. I should prioritize getting apples to catch up to the enemy.\n\nDOWN",

Immediate safe moves from (3, 1):**  \n- UP \u2192 (3, 2): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 0): apple.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 1): my body segment \u2192 **not safe**.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 1): empty.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**2. Enemy possible moves from (5, 4):**  \nEnemy safe moves:  \nUP (5, 5): empty.  \nDOWN (5, 3): enemy\u2019s body segment \u2192 no.  \nLEFT (4, 4): empty.  \nRIGHT (6, 4): enemy\u2019s body segment \u2192 no.  \nEnemy could go UP or LEFT.  \n\nEnemy Manhattan distance from me: |5-3| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Apple targeting:**  \nFrom (3, 1):  \n- DOWN (3, 0): apple \u2192 immediate growth.  \n- UP (3, 2): toward (3, 4) dist 2 from there, but enemy may also be heading there.  \n- RIGHT (4, 1): toward (4, 0) dist 1 from there next turn, or (3, 4) later.  \n\nClosest apple to me now: (3,0) dist 1, (4,0) dist 2, (3,4) dist 3.  \nEnemy at (5,4) \u2014 closest apple to them: (3,4) dist 2, (8,4) dist 3, (3,8) dist 5.  \nThey might go LEFT toward (3,4) or UP toward (3,8).  \n\n---\n\n**4. Future move options after each safe move:**  \n\n**DOWN to (3, 0) (apple):**  \nAfter eating, my body grows by 1 segment at the head \u2014 new head at (3,0), tail still at (1,6).  \nNext turn from (3,0):  \nUP (3, 1): my body (old head) \u2192 no.  \nDOWN off board \u2192 no.  \nLEFT (2, 0): empty.  \nRIGHT (4, 0): apple.  \nSafe moves: LEFT, RIGHT (apple). Only 2 safe moves, but RIGHT gets apple immediately.  \n\n**UP to (3, 2):**  \nNext turn neighbors:  \nUP (3, 3): empty.  \nDOWN (3, 1): my body \u2192 no.  \nLEFT (2, 2): my body \u2192 no.  \nRIGHT (4, 2): empty.  \nSafe moves: UP, RIGHT \u2192 limited.  \n\n**RIGHT to (4, 1):**  \nNext turn neighbors:  \nUP (4, 2): empty.  \nDOWN (4, 0): apple.  \nLEFT (3, 1): my body \u2192 no.  \nRIGHT (5, 1): empty.  \nSafe moves: UP, DOWN (apple), RIGHT \u2192 good mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Risk of head-on collision:**  \nEnemy could go LEFT to (4,4) or UP to (5,5).  \nIf I go UP to (3,2), enemy going LEFT twice could reach (3,4) in 2 turns, I\u2019d reach (3,4) in 2 turns if I go UP then UP \u2014 possible collision at (3,4) later if we race for that apple.  \nIf I go DOWN or RIGHT, I avoid that race for now.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Apple competition:**  \nEnemy is closer to (3,4) than I am. Better to let them have it unless I can get there safely without head-on risk. Safer to collect bottom apples first.  \n\n---\n\n**7. Decision:**  \nDOWN gives immediate apple and growth, but next turn mobility is reduced to 2 moves (LEFT or RIGHT).  \nRIGHT gives no immediate apple but keeps more options next turn and puts me closer to (4,0) apple next turn.  \nUP reduces mobility and risks racing enemy for (3,4).  \n\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT:  \n- DOWN: guaranteed apple now, but fewer options next turn.  \n- RIGHT: more options next turn, can get apple (4,0) next turn.  \n\nSince my length is 10 and enemy length is 9, growing now isn\u2019t urgent unless it secures a safer path.  \nRIGHT seems better for keeping future flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n**8. Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nIf I go RIGHT now to (4,1), next turn assess:  \n- DOWN to (4,0) for apple if enemy not heading there (they\u2019re far).  \n- Keep escape routes open, maybe go UP toward (3,4) later if enemy moves away.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nRIGHT",
