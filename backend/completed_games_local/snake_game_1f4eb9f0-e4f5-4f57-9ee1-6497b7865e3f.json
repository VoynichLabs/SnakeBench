That fool's got apples tauntin' him everywhere: (2,7) right to his left, (3,9) up top, (3,5) down below. Bet he's salivatin' for that easy left grab to (2,7) and grow fat quick. But us? We're at (8,5), prime position on the right flank, no body to worry about yet. Let's plot: I'll snag my nearby apple at (8,1) FAST, bulk up, then swing left to box him in the middle. No mercy, we're turnin' this into a trap-fest! \ud83d\ude80\n\nThinkin' out loud for the squad: All four moves are SAFE\u2014no edges, no bodies, opponent's too far for head-on drama. UP to (8,6)? Empty, but top-right's sparse, dead-end vibes. RIGHT to (9,5)? Wall-huggin' loser move, traps us quick. LEFT to (7,5)? Solid center pivot, opens paths west to chase him, but delays my apple run. DOWN to (8,4)? EMPTY GOLD\u2014straight shot down the column: next turns hit empties at (8,3), (8,2), then BAM (8,1) APPLE in 4 moves! No blocks, grows me to 1 apple edge, keeps south/west options WIDE open while he stuffs his face. Perfect for lurkin' and strikin' later. Who's the predator now? ME! \ud83d\udc09\ud83d\udca5\n\nLong-term strat note: Secure (8,1) apple in next 3 turns by holdin' down-path if clear; once grown, pivot left towards col 5-3 to cut off his north-south escapes after he likely LEFT-eats (2,7). Block his (3,5) or (3,9) follow-ups!\n\nDOWN",

Could be a setup for vertical bangers, but straight no-growth move? Boring! \ud83d\ude34\n\n- RIGHT to (4,7): Opens the right flank, closer to eventual fights with that ID #0 rat, but empty cell.

Why starve when you can feeeeast? \ud83d\ude0f\n\nRhetorical q: Why NOT go for the win instead of playing tag with empty spots? LEFTS the way \u2013 grow now, control the LEFT side, and plot to corner that snake! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5 They'll be eating my dust soon, streaming for mercy.

my opponent's apple is 21, and opponent's 24, and they're ahead, we need to eat more.\n\nThe board has many apples left, including at (9,2).\n\nI need to e aapple at (9,2), so I move to (9,2).\n\nFor the opponent, their head is blocked, but they can move to right or left as mentioned.\n\nFor long-term, we should plan to reach the top row and eat apples there.\n\nAfter (9,2), Up to (9,3), but (9,3) is marked T, so maybe not.\n\nFrom (9,2), since (9,3) is T, perhaps not safe, so perhaps there's a mistake, but since the objective is to stay alive, and UP is the only safe one, so we have to go with it.\n\nFor the move, it's UP.\n\nSo, to write the rationale, I need to copy the style: lots of zesty, enthusiastic, with emojis, questions, ruthless competitive.\n\nThen end with the move.\n\nThe response format is to have the *Rationale* with lots of texts, then the move at the end.\n\nLooking at the example in the last rationale, it's **START LAST RATIONALE** ... lots of text ... **END LAST RATIONALE** then UP\n\nSo, I need to output something similar.\n\nLet me create it. \n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nYO WHAT'S CRACKIN' CHAT!
