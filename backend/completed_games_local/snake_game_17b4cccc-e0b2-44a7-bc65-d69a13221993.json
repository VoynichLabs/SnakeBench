(2, 5): Distance Manhattan |1-2| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2\n2.  (2, 1) or (4, 2) or (6, 3): Distance 5-7\n\nThe apple at (2, 5) is the most appealing target.\n\n*   If I move **RIGHT** (1, 6) $\\rightarrow$ (2, 6). Then next turn I can move DOWN (2, 5) and eat the apple.\n*   If I move **DOWN** (1, 6) $\\rightarrow$ (1, 5). Then next turn I need to move RIGHT (2, 5) and eat the apple.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT lead to the apple at (2, 5) in two moves.\n\n**Considering Enemy Snake #1 (2, 3):**\n\nSnake #1's closest apples are:\n1. (2, 1): Distance |2-2| + |3-1| = 2 (Straight down, two moves).\n2. (6, 3): Distance |2-6| + |3-3| = 4 (Straight right, four moves).\n\nSnake #1 is likely going for the apple at (2, 1).\n*   If Snake #1 moves DOWN (2, 3) $\\rightarrow$ (2, 2). Next turn DOWN (2, 1) to eat.\n*   If Snake #1 moves LEFT or RIGHT, it moves away from the nearest apple.\n\nMy move selection is not immediately affected by Snake #1's likely move toward (2, 1), as we are far apart.\n\n**Optimal Move Selection (Target (2, 5)):**\n\nChoosing **DOWN** puts me at (1, 5). From there, RIGHT gets the apple.\nChoosing **RIGHT** puts me at (2, 6). From there, DOWN gets the apple.\n\nBoth options are equally efficient for reaching the primary target (2, 5).\n\nI will choose **RIGHT** (to (2, 6)). This expands my controlled area slightly more to the center of the board horizontally, which often keeps more options open.\n\n**Turn 0 Summary:**\n*   Move to (2, 6).\n*   Next turn: Move DOWN to (2, 5) to consume the apple.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:**\n1. Move RIGHT to (2, 6).\n2. Move DOWN to (2, 5) to collect the apple.\n3. Assess the board, possibly moving toward (2, 1) or (4, 2) if Snake #1 has moved away from them, or (8, 9) if safe to travel up.\n\nRIGHT",

None match my candidate cells (2,4), (2,2), (1,3), (3,3).  \n\nSo all four moves are safe from immediate death this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Evaluate apple proximity and future options:**  \n\nApples:  \n1. (6,3) \u2013 4 steps right, 0 vertical difference \u2192 Manhattan distance 4.  \n2. (4,2) \u2013 2 steps right, 1 down \u2192 distance 3.  \n3. (8,9) \u2013 far.  \n4. (2,1) \u2013 2 down \u2192 distance 2.  \n5. (2,5) \u2013 2 up \u2192 distance 2.  \n\nClosest apples: (2,1) and (2,5) both distance 2.  \n\nFrom (2,3):  \n- UP (2,4) \u2192 gets closer to (2,5) (now distance 1 next turn).  \n- DOWN (2,2) \u2192 gets closer to (2,1) (now distance 1 next turn).  \n- LEFT (1,3) \u2192 moves away from both (2,1) and (2,5).  \n- RIGHT (3,3) \u2192 moves away from both (2,1) and (2,5).  \n\nSo UP or DOWN are best for apple proximity.  \n\nCheck future safety after each:  \n\n**UP to (2,4):**  \nNext turn possible moves from (2,4): UP (2,5) [apple], DOWN (2,3) [empty], LEFT (1,4) [empty], RIGHT (3,4) [empty].  \nAll four would be open unless enemy moves there.  \n\n**DOWN to (2,2):**  \nNext turn possible moves: UP (2,3), DOWN (2,1) [apple], LEFT (1,2), RIGHT (3,2).  \nAlso all four open.  \n\nBoth are equally good for future options.  \n\n**Tie-break**: Let\u2019s see enemy\u2019s likely move. Enemy at (1,6) might go for apple (2,5) or (4,2) or (6,3).  \nApple (2,5) is 3 away from enemy (1,6): dx=1, dy=-1 \u2192 distance 2? Wait, (1,6) to (2,5): dx=1, dy=-1 \u2192 Manhattan 2.  \nSo enemy might move toward (2,5) by going LEFT? No, (2,5) is to its right and down. From (1,6) to (2,5) is: right 1, down 1 \u2192 could move RIGHT to (2,6) then DOWN to (2,5), or DOWN to (1,5) then RIGHT to (2,5).  \n\nIf enemy moves RIGHT this turn to (2,6), that\u2019s close to (2,5) apple, which is also my target if I go UP. Could cause competition for that apple next turn.  \n\nIf I go DOWN toward (2,1), enemy is farther from (2,1) (distance 5). Less competition.  \n\nSo maybe DOWN is better to avoid early conflict.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nWe\u2019re heading toward apple (2,1) to get first growth. Avoid enemy #0 initially; it\u2019s closer to apples (2,5) and (4,2). After eating (2,1), consider moving toward (4,2) or (6,3) while keeping space.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move choice:** DOWN  \n\nDOWN",

The enemy snake's movement is unknown but the previous rationale assumed it might try for (2, 1).\n\n**Target Apple Review:**\nThe closest apple to me (2, 6) is (2, 5).\nManhattan Distance: $|2-2| + |6-5| = 1$. The apple (2, 5) is one move away (DOWN).\n\n**Safe Moves Check for ID 0 (2, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 2, 7):** Safe.\n2.  **DOWN (to 2, 5):** Lands on an apple! This is a high-priority move.\n3.  **LEFT (to 1, 6):** Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 3, 6):** Safe.\n\n**Considering Enemy Snake #1 (2, 2):**\nSnake #1 is small and located far away. Its closest apple is (2, 1), 1 move away (DOWN).\nIf Snake #1 moves DOWN to (2, 1), it collects an apple.\n\n**Collision Analysis:**\nSince both snakes are only 1 segment long, the only collision risk is a head-on collision or moving into a wall/boundary.\n\n1. **Head-on collision (ID 0 vs ID 1):**\n    *   ID 0 is at (2, 6). ID 1 is at (2, 2). Distance 4 in Y. Collision is not possible this turn.\n2. **Moving into an enemy body:** This is impossible since both snakes have no body segments yet.\n\n**Evaluating Best Move:**\n\nThe move **DOWN** to (2, 5) immediately collects the nearest apple. This is the optimal move.\n\n*ID 0 (2, 6) moves DOWN $\\rightarrow$ (2, 5). Apple collected.*\n\nWe must also consider what Snake #1 is likely doing. Snake #1 (2, 2) is highly likely to move DOWN to (2, 1) to collect its nearest apple. However, since the moves are simultaneous, even if Snake #1 collects an apple, I will also collect mine, putting us tied at 1 apple each.\n\n**Potential Future State Forecast (Assuming ID 1 moves DOWN):**\n*   ID 0 new head: (2, 5). Length 2 (body at (2, 6)). Score 1.\n*   ID 1 new head: (2, 1). Length 2 (body at (2, 2)). Score 1.\n*   Apples remaining: (6, 3), (4, 2), (8, 9).\n\nThis move is safe and guarantees an apple collection.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:**\n1. Move DOWN to (2, 5) to collect the apple.\n2. Next turn, ID 0 will be at (2, 5), length 2 (body segment at (2, 6)). ID 1 likely at (2, 1), length 2 (body segment at (2, 2)).\n3. New targets: (6, 3) (distance 5), (4, 2) (distance 3). The apple at (4, 2) is closer to my new position (2, 5). I will look to move RIGHT then DOWN towards (4, 2) unless Snake #1 positions itself aggressively.\n\nDOWN",

However, moving backwards into your own body is only deadly if you have a body segment there. Since I have no body, UP is safe.\n\n*Board bounds:* All moves within 0\u20139.\n\n*Enemy body collision:* Enemy has no body yet, so no risk.\n\n*Head-on collision risk:* Enemy at (2,6) can move to: UP (2,7), DOWN (2,5), LEFT (1,6), RIGHT (3,6).  \nCheck if any of my moves land on the same cell as an enemy move:\n- My UP (2,3) vs enemy moves: no match.\n- My DOWN (2,1) vs enemy moves: no match.\n- My LEFT (1,2) vs enemy moves: no match.\n- My RIGHT (3,2) vs enemy moves: no match.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision possible this turn.\n\n*Enemy moving into my future head cell:* Enemy could move to (2,5), which is an apple but not my target cell. None of my candidate cells match enemy\u2019s possible moves.\n\nAll four moves are safe from immediate death.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Evaluate apple proximity and future options:**\n\nClosest apples:\n- (2,1) is 1 step DOWN (Manhattan distance 1).\n- (2,5) is 3 steps UP (distance 3).\n- (4,2) is 2 steps RIGHT (distance 2).\n- (6,3) is 4 steps RIGHT and 1 UP (distance 5).\n- (8,9) is far.\n\nBest apple: (2,1) is directly below me. DOWN moves me onto it, eating it this turn, growing to length 2, and scoring my first apple.\n\nOther moves:\n- UP moves toward (2,5) but not directly onto an apple.\n- LEFT moves away from all apples.\n- RIGHT moves toward (4,2) but not directly onto an apple.\n\n**Future safety after eating apple (2,1):**\nIf I go DOWN to (2,1), I eat the apple. My new head will be at (2,1), and my tail will remain at (2,2) because I grow by 1 segment (my body will be [(2,1), (2,2)]). Next turn, my possible moves from (2,1) will be UP (back to (2,2), which will be my neck), LEFT (1,1), RIGHT (3,1), DOWN (2,0). UP would move into my own new body segment at (2,2), so that would be fatal. So after eating, I must avoid UP next turn. That\u2019s okay; I\u2019ll have three other safe directions.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (2,6). It might move toward (2,5) apple (distance 1) or (4,2) (distance 4). If it goes DOWN to (2,5), it will eat that apple and grow. That\u2019s fine; I\u2019ll be eating (2,1) and gaining length.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Consider competition and future paths:**\n\nGoing DOWN to eat (2,1) gives me an early growth advantage. It also positions me to potentially move toward other apples like (4,2) or (6,3) next, while enemy is occupied with (2,5). Eating (2,1) also removes that apple from the board, reducing enemy\u2019s options later.\n\nAlternative moves like UP, LEFT, or RIGHT don\u2019t give me an apple this turn, delaying growth. Since the enemy is also length 1, getting the first growth could be crucial.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn:**\nAfter eating apple at (2,1), my body will be [(2,1), (2,2)]. Next turn, avoid moving UP into my own neck at (2,2). Consider moving RIGHT toward (4,2) apple or LEFT/DOWN to open space. Enemy may have eaten (2,5) and be longer. Stay clear of enemy head; keep distance.\n\n**Final move choice:** DOWN\n\nDOWN",

(Note: The rationale from last turn correctly predicted the consumption of (2,5) and (2,1)).\n\n### Safety Check for ID 0 at (2, 5):\n\nWe must eliminate moves that lead to death: off-board, into my body, or into an enemy body/head location (considering simultaneous movement).\n\n1.  **UP (to 2, 6):** Collides with my own body segment (2, 6). **DANGER (Eliminate)**. (Moving backwards into my body is a self-collision).\n2.  **DOWN (to 2, 4):** Safe.\n3.  **LEFT (to 1, 5):** Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 3, 5):** Safe.\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining:** DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Enemy Movement Prediction (ID 1 at 2, 1):\n\nID 1 is at (2, 1), length 2 (body at 2, 2). It has collected its nearest apple.\n\nCurrent closest apples to ID 1 (2, 1):\n*   (4, 2): Manhattan distance $|4-2| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3$.\n*   (6, 3): Manhattan distance $|6-2| + |3-1| = 4 + 2 = 6$.\n\nID 1's safe moves (must avoid (2, 2) and boundaries):\n*   UP (to 2, 2): Collision with its own body. **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n*   DOWN (to 2, 0): Safe.\n*   LEFT (to 1, 1): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (to 3, 1): Safe.\n\nID 1 is likely to move towards (4, 2). Possible beneficial moves for ID 1: RIGHT (to 3, 1) or DOWN (to 2, 0) then LEFT/RIGHT. Moving RIGHT to (3, 1) seems like a good first step towards (4, 2).\n\n### Move Evaluation for ID 0 (2, 5):\n\nID 0's location is (2, 5).\n\nCurrent closest apples to ID 0 (2, 5):\n1.  **(4, 4):** Manhattan distance $|4-2| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3$.\n2.  **(2, 8):** Manhattan distance $|2-2| + |8-5| = 0 + 3 = 3$.\n3.  **(4, 2):** Manhattan distance $|4-2| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5$.\n4.  **(6, 3):** Manhattan distance $|6-2| + |3-5| = 4 + 2 = 6$.\n\nSince (4, 4) and (2, 8) are equally close (distance 3), I must decide which path offers better long-term options and avoids conflict.\n\n**Option A: Move RIGHT (path towards (4, 4))**\n*   Move R $\\rightarrow$ (3, 5). Distance to (4, 4) becomes 1 + 1 = 2.\n*   This also positions me closer to (4, 2) which ID 1 might pursue.\n*   No immediate self-collision risk.\n\n**Option B: Move DOWN (path towards (4, 4) or (4, 2))**\n*   Move D $\\rightarrow$ (2, 4). Distance to (4, 4) becomes 2 + 0 = 2.\n*   Distance to (4, 2) becomes 2 + 2 = 4.\n*   This keeps me centralized.\n\n**Option C: Move LEFT (general move)**\n*   Move L $\\rightarrow$ (1, 5). Distance to both target apples increases slightly. Least optimal.\n\nComparing RIGHT and DOWN: Both lead to distance 2 from apple (4, 4) in the next turn.\n\n*   If I move **RIGHT (3, 5)**: I prepare to move DOWN/RIGHT to reach (4, 4) next turn.\n*   If I move **DOWN (2, 4)**: I prepare to move RIGHT/UP to reach (4, 4) next turn.\n\nMoving RIGHT seems slightly more flexible, preparing for the R/D move sequence necessary for (4, 4) (which is (4, 4) is 1 move from (3, 4), and (3, 4) is 1 move from (3, 5) or (2, 4)).\n\nLet's look at the apple (2, 8). This is 3 moves UP. Moving DOWN or RIGHT ignores this apple.\n\nIf I choose to target **(2, 8)**, the natural move sequence is UP, but UP is currently blocked by my own body segment (2, 6).\n\nTherefore, I must clear my body segment at (2, 6) before I can move to (2, 7) and then eventually (2, 8). The only way to clear (2, 6) is to move to a non-colliding cell, causing the tail (2, 6) to shift off the board (since my length is 2).\n\n*Step 1: Move away (e.g., RIGHT to 3, 5).*\n*New Head: (3, 5). New Tail: (2, 5) (was 2, 6, now 2, 5 is the tail). Length remains 2.*\n*The cell (2, 6) is now free.*\n\n*Step 2 (Next turn): Move UP (to 3, 6).* Still not heading towards (2, 8).\n\nTrying for the closer apples (4, 4) or (4, 2) seems smarter, as the path is open. Targeting (4, 4) with a path like RIGHT -> DOWN -> RIGHT seems ideal.\n\nMy preferred move is **RIGHT** to position for the apple at (4, 4).\n\n### Collision Check (RIGHT move for ID 0):\n\n*   ID 0 moves to (3, 5). Safe from walls/body.\n*   ID 1 is likely moving DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT from (2, 1). Worst case, ID 1 moves UP to (2, 2) (which is blocked) or tries a strange move diagonal towards me. No immediate head-on collision risk with (3, 5).\n\nThe target (4, 4) is appealing and requires moving RIGHT first.\n\nLong-term plan for next few turns:\n1. Move RIGHT to (3, 5) targeting apple (4, 4).\n2. Next turn, move DOWN or RIGHT again to reach (4, 4) or continue positioning.\n3. Keep an eye on Enemy Snake #1's trajectory towards (4, 2). We might try to steal (4, 2) if ID 1 moves slowly or poorly.\n\nRIGHT",

UP goes into (2,1) which will be empty, safe. But far from apples.  \n   - Keeps me away from enemy head.  \n\n2. **LEFT to (1,1):**  \n   - Moves slightly away from (4,2) but not terrible.  \n   - Next turn from (1,1): can go UP (1,2), DOWN (1,0), RIGHT (2,1), LEFT (0,1). Opens more options.  \n   - Still not toward nearest apple quickly.  \n\n3. **RIGHT to (3,1):**  \n   - Moves toward (4,2) apple (now distance 2 instead of 3).  \n   - Next turn from (3,1): can go UP (3,2), DOWN (3,0), LEFT (2,1), RIGHT (4,1). UP (3,2) is closer to (4,2).  \n   - Also keeps distance from enemy at (2,5).  \n\nRIGHT seems best for apple proximity.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety after RIGHT:**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (3,1), my body becomes [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2)].  \nNext turn, moving LEFT to (2,1) would be into my own body \u2192 deadly. So I\u2019d avoid LEFT next turn. But UP, DOWN, RIGHT would be safe.  \n\nEnemy could move toward (4,4) or (2,8) and might not interfere with my path to (4,2).  \n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (3,1), target (4,2) apple via UP then RIGHT, or RIGHT then UP. Avoid moving LEFT into own body. Keep tracking enemy head at (2,5) \u2014 if it moves toward (4,4), we may cross paths near center later; stay aware.  \n\n**Final choice:** RIGHT  \n\nRIGHT",

ID 1 is likely still aiming for the closest apple, (4, 2).\nPath distance to (4, 2) from (3, 1): $|4-3| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nID 1's safe moves (must avoid (2, 1) and boundaries):\n1.

If ID 1 chooses UP, it will be at (3, 2) next turn. If ID 1 chooses RIGHT, it will be at (4, 1). Both are strong moves. I will assume ID 1 moves UP, as it keeps distance from the wall.\n\n### Move Evaluation for ID 0 (3, 5):\n\nID 0 is at (3, 5).\n\nClosest reachable apples:\n1.  **(4, 4):** Distance $|4-3| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n2.  **(6, 3):** Distance $|6-3| + |3-5| = 3 + 2 = 5$.\n3.  **(4, 2):** Distance $|4-3| + |2-5| = 1 + 3 = 4$. (Contested by ID 1)\n4.  **(2, 8):** Distance $|2-3| + |8-5| = 1 + 3 = 4$.\n\nThe apple at (4, 4) is clearly the best immediate target (distance 2).\n\n**Option A: Move DOWN (to 3, 4)**\n*   New distance to (4, 4) is $|4-3| + |4-4| = 1$. This is the fastest way to get to (4, 4).\n*   Path: DOWN $\\rightarrow$ RIGHT/UP.\n*   Safe from ID 1 conflict (ID 1 is far south).\n\n**Option B: Move RIGHT (to 4, 5)**\n*   New distance to (4, 4) is $|4-4| + |4-5| = 1$. Also fastest way to get to (4, 4).\n*   Path: RIGHT $\\rightarrow$ DOWN.\n*   Safe from ID 1 conflict.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT bring me 1 move away from (4, 4).\n\nIf I move **DOWN (3, 4)**, the next move is RIGHT (to 4, 4) to eat the apple.\nIf I move **RIGHT (4, 5)**, the next move is DOWN (to 4, 4) to eat the apple.\n\nMoving RIGHT might put me slightly further away from the contested apple (4, 2) which is now 3 moves away, whereas moving DOWN keeps (4, 2) 3 moves away (3, 4 $\\rightarrow$ 3, 3 $\\rightarrow$ 4, 3 $\\rightarrow$ 4, 2).\n\nSince the paths are equally effective for reaching (4, 4), let's look at long-term positioning. Moving DOWN aligns me vertically, which is generally good for exploration, but moving right keeps options open towards the center of the board.\n\nI will prioritize the move that completes the path to (4, 4) in the simplest manner.\n\nChoosing **RIGHT** (to 4, 5):\n1. Next turn I can move DOWN to immediately consume the apple at (4, 4).\n2. Staying on y=5 moves me away from potentially converging paths with ID 1 (who is moving up from y=1).\n\nIf ID 1 moved to (3, 2), they are still far from (4, 5). No collision risk.\n\nThe plan is simple: secure (4, 4).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1. Move RIGHT to (4, 5).\n2. Move DOWN to (4, 4) and eat the apple.\n3.

Away from all apples.\n3. **LEFT (to 3, 2):** Collision with body segment. **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n4. **RIGHT (to 5, 2):** Safe. Towards (6, 3).\n\nID 1 will likely choose UP or RIGHT to head toward (6, 3). Moving UP (4, 3) seems most direct to set up for (6, 3). Moving RIGHT (5, 2) also advances towards (6, 3).\n\n*Prediction: ID 1 moves UP to (4, 3) or RIGHT to (5, 2).*\n\n### Move Evaluation for ID 0 (4, 4):\n\nThe next primary target is the closest apple (6, 3).\nID 0 (4, 4) to (6, 3): Distance 3 (2 right, 1 down).\n\n1.  **Move DOWN (to 4, 3):**\n    *   Moves 1 step closer to (6, 3) (New distance 2: 2 right, 0 down).\n    *   **Collision Risk:** If ID 1 moves UP (to 4, 3), a head-on collision occurs. **DANGER (High Risk)**.\n\n2.  **Move RIGHT (to 5, 4):**\n    *   Moves 1 step closer to (6, 3) (New distance 2: 1 right, 1 down).\n    *   Safe from ID 1's predicted movements (4, 3) or (5, 2).\n    *   Sets up for DOWN or RIGHT next turn.\n\n3.  **Move LEFT (to 3, 4):**\n    *   Moves away from (6, 3). Increased distance.\n\nComparing DOWN and RIGHT:\nMoving DOWN (to 4, 3) is the shortest Manhattan distance path towards (6, 3), but it puts me directly in the path of ID 1 if they move UP. Given that ID 1 is at (4, 2) and (6, 3) is the closest apple for them, moving UP is a strong candidate for ID 1.\n\nMoving RIGHT (to 5, 4) is safer. It advances toward the target (6, 3) while keeping a safe distance from ID 1's immediate threat zone (4, 2/4, 3).\n\n**Optimal safe move is RIGHT (to 5, 4).**\n\n### Long-term Plan (Next 2-3 Turns):\n\n1.  (T=5): Move RIGHT to (5, 4) to approach (6, 3) safely. ID 1 likely moves UP (4, 3) or RIGHT (5, 2).\n2.  (T=6): ID 0 at (5, 4). Move DOWN to (5, 3). (Distance to (6, 3) is now 1 step right).\n3.

Let's reconstruct: previous head was (3,2)? Actually body shows head (4,2), then (3,2), then (3,1). So last move was from (3,2) to (4,2) \u2192 RIGHT. That matches last move info.)\n\n**Possible moves from (4,2):**\n- UP: to (4,3) \u2192 contains apple (4,3)? Yes, apple at (4,3). But enemy snake head at (4,4) could move down to (4,3) same turn? Possibly head-on collision risk.\n- DOWN: to (4,1) \u2192 empty? Board shows at (4,1) is '.'? Wait, board row 1 shows at x=4 is '.'? Row y=1: positions: 0 ., 1 ., 2 ., 3 T (tail of my snake at (3,1)? Actually (3,1) is my tail, not (4,1)). So (4,1) is empty.\n- LEFT: to (3,2) \u2192 my own body segment (second segment) \u2192 suicide.\n- RIGHT: to (5,2) \u2192 empty.\n\n**Check immediate death moves:**\n1. LEFT: into own body at (3,2) \u2192 eliminate.\n2. UP: into (4,3) \u2014 is that safe? It's an apple cell. No snake body there currently. But enemy snake head at (4,4) could move DOWN to (4,3) same turn \u2192 possible head-on collision. Both length 3 \u2192 tie \u2192 both die. Risky.\n3. DOWN: to (4,1) \u2014 empty, no body, within board.\n4. RIGHT: to (5,2) \u2014 empty, no body, within board.\n\nSo safe immediate moves: DOWN, RIGHT. UP is risky due to possible head-on collision.\n\n**Consider enemy's possible moves from (4,4):**\nEnemy body: [(4,5), (3,5)]. So it cannot move UP (into its own body at (4,5)? Actually (4,5) is its second segment? Wait: enemy body: head (4,4), then (4,5), then (3,5). So from (4,4), possible moves:\n- UP to (4,5) \u2192 own body \u2192 no.\n- DOWN to (4,3) \u2192 possible, and apple there.\n- LEFT to (3,4) \u2192 empty.\n- RIGHT to (5,4) \u2192 empty.\n\nEnemy might go for apple at (4,3) by moving DOWN. That's likely. If I move UP to (4,3) same turn, we collide head-on \u2192 both die (same length). So UP is dangerous.\n\n**Which move gives better future options?**\n- DOWN to (4,1): puts me near my tail (3,1) and (3,2). Next turn from (4,1): possible moves UP (back to (4,2) \u2014 my previous head position, now empty), LEFT (to (3,1) \u2014 my tail, but tail will move if I don't eat apple? Actually tail moves forward each turn unless I eat apple. Since I'm not eating apple this turn, my tail at (3,1) will disappear next turn, so (3,1) becomes empty. So LEFT next turn might be safe. DOWN to (4,0) board edge \u2014 risky later. RIGHT to (5,1) empty. So decent options.\n- RIGHT to (5,2): from there, next moves: UP to (5,3) empty, DOWN to (5,1) empty, RIGHT to (6,2) empty, LEFT back to (4,2) empty. More open space.\n\nRIGHT seems to keep more options open.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\n- Apple at (4,3) is closest but risky.\n- Apple at (6,3) is 2 steps right, 1 up from (4,2).\n- Apple at (0,3) far left.\n- Apple at (2,8) far.\n- Apple at (8,9) far.\n\nRIGHT moves me toward apple at (6,3). DOWN moves me away from most apples.\n\n**Long-term plan:** I want to avoid head-on collisions, stay alive, and gradually collect apples. Since enemy is above me and might go for (4,3), I should avoid that cell this turn. I can move RIGHT to open space and approach (6,3) safely next turn. Also, moving RIGHT avoids trapping myself.\n\n**Final decision:** RIGHT is safe and moves toward apple while keeping options open.\n\nRIGHT",

Away from apples.\n3. **LEFT (to 4, 2):** Collision with body segment. **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n4. **RIGHT (to 6, 2):** Safe. Towards (6, 3).\n\nBoth UP (5, 3) and RIGHT (6, 2) are strong moves towards apples. ID 1 has an easier path to (6, 3) via RIGHT (6, 2) or UP (5, 3). Moving UP to (5, 3) immediately positions them to strike (6, 3) or (4, 3) next round.\n\n*Prediction: ID 1 moves UP to (5, 3) or RIGHT to (6, 2).*\n\n### Move Evaluation for ID 0 (5, 4):\n\nID 0 is currently at (5, 4).\n\nThe immediate targets are (6, 3) and the *newly spawned* (4, 3).\n\n1.  **Move DOWN (to 5, 3):**\n    *   If ID 1 moves UP (to 5, 3), a head-on collision occurs. **DANGER (High Risk)**.\n    *   This is the shortest path to both (6, 3) (distance 2) and (4, 3) (distance 2).\n\n2.  **Move RIGHT (to 6, 4):**\n    *   Moves 1 step closer to (6, 3) (New distance 1: 0 right, 1 down).\n    *   Sets up for DOWN move next turn to eat (6, 3).\n    *   If ID 1 moves RIGHT (to 6, 2), they remain safely separated.\n    *   If ID 1 moves UP (to 5, 3), they remain safely separated. **High Safety.**\n\n3.  **Move UP (to 5, 5):**\n    *   Moves away from closest apples. Does not contribute to immediate objective.\n\n**Comparison of DOWN and RIGHT:**\n\nMoving DOWN (5, 3) is a direct confrontation for the (6, 3) and (4, 3) apples, as ID 1 is strongly predicted to move into this vicinity (either to (5, 3) or (6, 2)). Since moving DOWN presents a high risk of head-on collision with ID 1 moving UP, it must be avoided.\n\nMoving RIGHT (6, 4) is the safest and most efficient path to securing apple (6, 3). It guarantees I am ahead of ID 1 for that apple, as they would need two moves (e.g., RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT) to reach (6, 3) from their predicted positions, whereas I am set up to eat it in one move next turn.\n\n### Long-term Plan (Next 2 Turns):\n\n1. (T=6): Move RIGHT to (6, 4) to avoid collision and prepare for apple (6, 3). ID 1 likely moves into (5, 3) or (6, 2).\n2. (T=7): ID 0 at (6, 4). Move DOWN to (6, 3) to eat the apple. ID 1 will likely be stuck deciding between the newly occupied (6, 3) and the open (4, 3).\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n- **DOWN to (5,1):** Empty (`.`). Safe.\n- **LEFT to (4,2):** My own body (second segment). **Suicide.**\n- **RIGHT to (6,2):** Empty (`.`). Safe.\n\nSo LEFT is eliminated.\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**\nThe enemy head at (5,4) can move DOWN to (5,3). If I move UP to (5,3) same turn, we collide head-on. Both length 3 \u2192 both die. So UP is risky.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\n- Apple at (6,3) is 1 step RIGHT, 1 step UP from me.\n- Apple at (4,3) is 1 step LEFT, 1 step UP (but LEFT is blocked by my body).\n- Apple at (0,3) far.\n- Apple at (2,8) far.\n- Apple at (8,9) far.\n\nMoving RIGHT gets me closer to (6,3). Moving DOWN moves away from apples.\n\n**Future options:**\n- **UP (5,3):** Risky due to possible head-on. If enemy doesn't go DOWN, it's safe and puts me closer to (6,3). But enemy might reasonably go DOWN for apple at (4,3) or to avoid me? Actually enemy might avoid head-on too, but it's a gamble.\n- **DOWN (5,1):** Safe, but leads to bottom edge; next turn from (5,1) options are UP (back to 5,2), LEFT (4,1), RIGHT (6,1), DOWN (5,0). Opens some space but away from apples.\n- **RIGHT (6,2):** Safe, opens space toward right side. Next turn from (6,2): UP to (6,3) apple, DOWN to (6,1), RIGHT to (7,2), LEFT back to (5,2). Good options and directly sets up for apple at (6,3) next turn.\n\n**Enemy likely moves:**\nEnemy at (5,4) with body [(4,4), (4,5)]. It cannot move UP into (5,5) (empty) or DOWN into (5,3) (empty), LEFT into (4,4) own body, RIGHT into (6,4) empty. It might go for apple at (4,3) by moving LEFT to (4,4)? Wait, (4,4) is its own body segment, so LEFT is invalid. Actually its possible safe moves: UP (5,5), DOWN (5,3), RIGHT (6,4). It might go DOWN to (5,3) for potential apple or to move toward center. So UP remains risky for me.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,2), next turn I can likely go UP to (6,3) to eat the apple, provided enemy doesn't also target it. Enemy would need two moves to reach (6,3) from (5,4) (e.g., RIGHT to (6,4) then DOWN to (6,3)), so I'd get there first if I move UP next turn. However, I must check for other snakes or hazards then. For now, secure safe positioning.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT is safe, advances toward an apple, and keeps future options open. Avoid the risky UP move.\n\nRIGHT",

This is the best move for ID 1.\n2. **DOWN (to 6, 1):** Safe. Away from apples.\n3. **LEFT (to 5, 2):** Collision with body segment. **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n4. **RIGHT (to 7, 2):** Safe. Away from immediate apples, but provides options.\n\n**Strongest Prediction: ID 1 moves UP to (6, 3) to eat the apple.**\n\n### Move Evaluation and Collision Check:\n\nBoth snakes are positioned to move onto the apple at (6, 3) this turn.\n\n*   **ID 0 Move DOWN (to 6, 3):** Collision risk with ID 1.\n*   **ID 1 Predicted Move UP (to 6, 3):** Collision risk with ID 0.\n\nIf both snakes move to (6, 3), a head-on collision occurs. Since both snakes are length 3, both will die. We must avoid this outcome if possible, as a tie on apples (2-2) where both die is undesirable.\n\nIf we move DOWN, we are intentionally moving into a high-risk collision square.\n\n**Alternative Safe Moves for ID 0:**\n\n1.  **Move UP (to 6, 5):** Safe. Moves away from (6, 3) and (4, 3), but maintains position superiority over ID 1 for apples further North or West. Opens up space for future movement.\n2.  **Move RIGHT (to 7, 4):** Safe. Moves away from apples.\n\n*Our objective is to safely eat apples.* Since (6, 3) is a guaranteed double-kill scenario (both die, tie score), we must concede this apple and focus on the next best target: (4, 3).\n\nIf ID 1 takes (6, 3), our next move must secure (4, 3) or position us for the far-off apples.\n\n**Conceding (6, 3) to gain (4, 3):**\n\n*   If ID 0 moves **UP (to 6, 5)**:\n    *   T=7: ID 0 at (6, 5). ID 1 at (6, 3) [Eats].\n    *   T=8: ID 0 needs two moves to reach (4, 3) (e.g., LEFT, LEFT or LEFT, DOWN). ID 1 is now longer (L=4) and blocks the right side.\n*   If ID 0 moves **RIGHT (to 7, 4)**:\n    *   T=7: ID 0 at (7, 4). ID 1 at (6, 3) [Eats].\n    *   This move takes us completely away from apples at (4, 3) and (2, 8). It sets us up for (8, 9), but that will allow ID 1 to easily scoop (4, 3) and (2, 8) before we get back.\n\nThe best strategic move is to reposition for (4, 3) while respecting the collision threat on (6, 3).\n\nTo capture (4, 3) optimally, we need to move towards X=4, Y=3.\n\nCurrent (6, 4). Target (4, 3).\n1. Move LEFT is disallowed (self-collision).\n2. Moving UP or RIGHT wastes the turn.\n\nWait, the move LEFT to (5, 4) is blocked by our body segment (5, 4).\n\nLet's re-examine the collision and access to (4, 3).\nIf ID 1 takes (6, 3) (Length 4), their head is now at (6, 3), body at [(6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2)].\n\nIf ID 0 moves **UP (to 6, 5)**:\n*   T=8 from (6, 5): Move LEFT (to 5, 5). Safe.\n*   T=9 from (5, 5): Move LEFT (to 4, 5). Safe.\n*   T=10 from (4, 5): Move DOWN (to 4, 4). Safe.\n*   T=11 from (4, 4): Move DOWN (to 4, 3) [Eats]. (4 moves to eat, ID 1 has 3 turns lead).\n\nIf ID 0 takes a move that avoids the center line, we can try to secure (4, 3) fast.\n\nSince moving DOWN to (6, 3) is suicidally dangerous (we tie on length, both die), we absolutely must yield the immediate apple. Moving **UP** (6, 5) seems like the least worst option as it keeps us moving North, allowing us to pivot West towards (2, 8) or South-West towards (4, 3) later, without being trapped on the right wall yet.\n\nIf we move UP, ID 1 has a clear path to (6, 3). We must then rush (4, 3) before ID 1 gets there.\n\n**Future Plan Notes (Next 3 Turns):**\n1. (T=7, ID 0 at 6, 4): Move UP to (6, 5). Concede (6, 3). ID 1 will likely take (6, 3) (L=4).\n2. (T=8, ID 0 at 6, 5): Turn LEFT toward (4, 3). Move LEFT to (5, 5).\n3. (T=9, ID 0 at 5, 5): Move LEFT to (4, 5).\n4. (T=10, ID 0 at 4, 5): Move DOWN to (4, 4) or 4, 3 if safe.\n\nThis is a defensive move to avoid a fatal tie, sacrificing a point but ensuring continued survival and pursuing the next target.\n\nUP",

Apple at (8,9), (2,8), (0,3) are farther.\n\n**Future options:**\n- **UP (6,3):** Eat apple, grow to length 4. But risk head-on if enemy moves DOWN. However, enemy might avoid DOWN if it predicts my move? Unclear. Eating apple gives me advantage.\n- **DOWN (6,1):** Safe, moves away from apples. Next turn from (6,1): UP back to (6,2), LEFT (5,1), RIGHT (7,1), DOWN (6,0). Opens space but delays apple collection.\n- **RIGHT (7,2):** Safe, moves right.

Since LEFT is blocked, DOWN is a strong candidate because it's toward an apple and safe (unless I go UP). If I move UP, we might collide. If I move RIGHT or DOWN, I avoid collision.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**\nIf I move RIGHT to (7,2), I stay safe and can consider moving toward apples later. However, enemy might eat the apple at (6,3) if it moves DOWN, giving it a length advantage. Since we're tied at 2 apples, letting enemy get apple could put me behind.\n\nGiven the rules, if I die, I lose. So avoiding head-on is critical. But if I don't take the apple, enemy might. However, enemy might also avoid DOWN to avoid head-on. It's a gamble.\n\n**Decision:** UP is tempting but risky. RIGHT is safe and keeps me alive. Since survival is paramount, I'll choose RIGHT. It also positions me to possibly go for apple at (8,9) later or other apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Pivots toward (6, 3) or (8, 9).\n2. **DOWN (to 7, 1):** Safe. Away from apples.\n3. **LEFT (to 6, 2):** Collision with body segment. **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n4. **RIGHT (to 8, 2):** Safe. Pivots toward (8, 9).\n\n**Strongest Prediction: ID 1 moves UP to (7, 3)**, setting up for (6, 3) next turn, or moving RIGHT to (8, 2) to pursue (8, 9). Given the proximity of (6, 3), UP is most likely.\n\n### Move Evaluation and Collision Check:\n\nWe still have the apple at (6, 3) available. We are 2 steps away. ID 1 is 2 steps away (if they move UP, they are 1 step away next turn).\n\nTarget: (6, 3).\n\n| Our Move (ID 0) | New Head Position (ID 0) | ID 1 Prediction (H1 at 7, 3) | Outcome |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **UP** | (6, 6) | (7, 3) | Safe. Move away from target. |\n| **LEFT** | (5, 5) | (7, 3) | Safe. Move toward (4, 3), away from (6, 3). |\n| **RIGHT** | (7, 5) | (7, 3) | Safe. ID 0 closer to (8, 9). |\n\nWe chose UP last turn to avoid a potential head-on collision at (6, 3). That collision did not happen, and the apple is still free. Getting to (6, 3) quickly is now paramount as ID 1 is repositioning.\n\n**Option 1: Go for (6, 3)**\nTo get to (6, 3), we need 2 steps (e.g., UP is blocked, so we need to navigate *around* our neck segment at (6, 4)). Wait, our neck segment is *at* (6, 4), and moving DOWN is illegal.\n\nID 0 Head (6, 5). Body [(6, 4), (5, 4)].\n*   Move DOWN to (6, 4) is illegal (reverse onto neck).\n\nTherefore, we cannot move directly towards (6, 3) from (6, 5). We must move LEFT or RIGHT first.\n\nIf ID 0 moves **LEFT (to 5, 5)**:\n*   T=9 from (5, 5): Move DOWN to (5, 4)? No, (5, 4) is our tail segment/body.\n*   T=9 from (5, 5): Move LEFT to (4, 5). Safe.\n\nIf ID 0 moves **RIGHT (to 7, 5)**:\n*   T=9 from (7, 5): Move DOWN to (7, 4). Safe.\n*   T=10 from (7, 4): Move LEFT to (6, 4)? No, our old head/new body will be at (6, 5), (7, 4). (6, 4) will be the new tail position. Yes, (6, 4) will be open for consumption (or land on the 6, 4 body segment, depending on if we shrunk).\n\nLet's re-examine body movement. Since we didn't eat an apple last turn, our tail (5, 4) moved to (6, 4) and then to (6, 5) as the head.\nT=7 Start: H(6, 4), B[(5, 4), (4, 4)].\nT=7 Move UP. New H(6, 5). Snake B[(6, 4), (5, 4)]. The tail (4, 4) was removed.\n\nCurrent Body Composition (T=8, ID 0):\nH: (6, 5)\nB: (6, 4), (5, 4)\n\n1.  Move DOWN to (6, 4)? **Illegal.** (Body segment)\n2.  Move LEFT to (5, 5)? Safe.\n3.  Move RIGHT to (7, 5)? Safe.\n4.  Move UP to (6, 6)? Safe.\n\n**Option 2: Go for (4, 3)**\n(4, 3) is 3 steps away: (6, 5) -> (5, 5) -> (4, 5) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 3). (4 steps if we avoid (4, 4) being our body).\n\nIf we move LEFT to (5, 5):\n*   T=9 from (5, 5): Move LEFT to (4, 5).\n*   T=10 from (4, 5): Move DOWN to (4, 4).\n*   T=11 from (4, 4): Move DOWN to (4, 3) [Eats].\nThis takes 3 turns to reach the cell *next* to (4, 3) and 4 turns total to eat. Is ID 1 likely to intercept? ID 1 (7, 2) is 4 steps away minimum. This seems relatively safe for (4, 3).\n\n**Option 3: Go for (2, 8)**\n(2, 8) is far, 7 steps away minimum.\n\n**Returning to (6, 3) Strategy:**\nSince moving DOWN is illegal, we must pivot.\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (7, 5)**:\n*   T=9 from (7, 5): Move DOWN to (7, 4).\n*   T=10 from (7, 4): Move DOWN to (7, 3).\n*   T=11 from (7, 3): Move LEFT to (6, 3) [Eats]. (3 turns to eat).\n\nCompare path for ID 1 (Prediction: UP to 7, 3):\n*   T=9 from (7, 3): Move LEFT to (6, 3) [Eats]. (1 turn to eat).\n\nID 1 is guaranteed to beat us to (6, 3) if they move UP this turn and follow the shortest path. ID 1 moved RIGHT last turn, putting them into a stronger position relative to (6, 3) than we thought.\n\n**Conclusion:** We must concede (6, 3) as ID 1 is highly likely to take it next turn (T=9). We should focus on (4, 3).\n\n### Decision: Move LEFT\n\nMoving LEFT (to 5, 5) starts the trajectory towards the apple at (4, 3).\n\n| Turn | ID 0 Move (H) | ID 1 Predicted Move (H) | Apple Target |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| T=8 | LEFT (5, 5) | UP (7, 3) | Set route for (4, 3) |\n| T=9 | LEFT (4, 5) | LEFT (6, 3) [Eat] | Continue route for (4, 3) |\n| T=10 | DOWN (4, 4) | UP/LEFT/DOWN (6, 3)* | Continue route for (4, 3) |\n| T=11 | DOWN (4, 3) [Eat] | - | Success |\n\n*If ID 1 eats (6, 3), they will be length 4 and likely focus on (4, 3) next, but we have a slight lead.*\n\nID 1 at (6, 3) is 2 steps away from (4, 3) (LEFT, UP/DOWN/LEFT, LEFT, etc). If ID 1 moves LEFT to (5, 3) this turn (T=10), then LEFT to (4, 3) (T=11), they will intercept us.\n\n*   ID 0: (4, 4) at T=10.\n*   ID 1: (6, 3) at T=9.\n    *   T=10: Move UP to (6, 4)? Or LEFT to (5, 3).\n    *   If ID 1 moves LEFT to (5, 3) at T=10, they are 1 step away from (4, 3), just like us.\n\nThis still creates a potential head-on collision at (4, 3) on T=11. We need a more defensive/guaranteed path.\n\n**Option 4: Go for (2, 8) or (8, 9)**\n\nIf we prioritize the corners, we avoid ID 1 for a while. ID 1 is now far South/East.\n\n1.  **Move UP (to 6, 6):** Set course for (8, 9) or (2, 8). (8, 9) is 6 steps away (R, R, U, U, U, U). (2, 8) is 7 steps away (L, L, U, U, U).\n\nIf we move UP, we continue drawing ID 0 North and East, away from the tight center. This clears space for (4, 3) if ID 1 goes for (6, 3).\n\nIf ID 1 eats (6, 3) at T=9, they are L=4 at (6, 3). They must then choose between (4, 3) (2 steps away) or chase us North. They will likely go for (4, 3).\n\nIf we move UP (7, 5), we target the corner.\n*   (T=8) ID 0 H(6, 6). ID 1 H(7, 3).\n*   (T=9) ID 0 H(7, 6). ID 1 H(6, 3) [Eat].\n*   (T=10) ID 0 H(8, 6). ID 1 H(5, 3) (Likely moving towards (4, 3)).\n\nThis avoids immediate collision and gives us a safe apple (8, 9).\n\nLet's stick with the path to (8, 9) by moving **RIGHT** now, and then continuing RIGHT.\n\nPlan for (8, 9):\n1. (T=8) Move RIGHT (to 7, 5).\n2. (T=9) Move RIGHT (to 8, 5).\n3. (T=10) Move UP (to 8, 6).\n4. (T=11) Move UP (to 8, 7).\n5. (T=12) Move UP (to 8, 8).\n6. (T=13) Move UP (to 8, 9) [Eats].\n\nThis path is 6 turns, completely safe from ID 1 for now, and guarantees an apple.\n\n### Final Check:\n\n*   Move RIGHT (to 7, 5). Safe.\n*   Keeps us ahead of ID 1 relative to (8, 9).\n*   Avoids collision at (6, 3) and potential collision at (4, 3).\n\n**Long-term strategy note:** ID 1 is favored to take (6, 3) next turn (T=9) and likely (4, 3) after that. We must pursue the distant (8, 9) immediately via the right side to get a safe apple and then assess if (2, 8) is viable afterwards.\n\nRIGHT",

This apple is the closest and provides immediate growth. It is highly likely ID 1 will move LEFT to (6, 3) and eat the apple.\n\nPossible moves for ID 1 (must avoid (7, 2) and boundaries):\n1. **UP (to 7, 4):** Safe. Puts H1 1 step away from H0 (7, 5). Potential for next-turn head-on if H0 moves into (7, 6) or H1 moves into (7, 5).\n2. **DOWN (to 7, 2):** Collision with body segment. **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n3. **LEFT (to 6, 3):** Eats apple A(6, 3). **HIGHLY LIKELY.**\n4. **RIGHT (to 8, 3):** Safe. Moves toward (4, 3) less directly, or towards (8, 9).\n\n**Strongest Prediction: ID 1 moves LEFT to (6, 3), eating the apple.** (This assumes the last rationale's prediction of H1 moving UP to (7, 3) was correct, which it was.)\n\n### Move Evaluation and Collision Check (Assuming ID 1 moves LEFT to (6, 3)):\n\nThe path taken by ID 0 last turn (RIGHT to 7, 5) committed us to the **(8, 9)** apple target, avoiding the conflict over (6, 3). We must now continue that path to secure our score.\n\n**Target: (8, 9)** (5 steps away: $R \\to U \\to U \\to U \\to U$)\n\n| Our Move (ID 0) | New Head Position (ID 0) | ID 1 Prediction (H1 at 6, 3, EATING) | Notes / Outcome |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **UP** | (7, 6) | (6, 3) | Safe. Moves perpendicular to target path. |\n| **DOWN** | (7, 4) | (6, 3) | Safe. Note: H1 could move UP to (7, 4) instead of LEFT to (6, 3). This would be a Head-on Collision! **DANGER if prediction fails.** |\n| **RIGHT** | (8, 5) | (6, 3) | Safe. Continues path toward (8, 9). |\n\n#### Re-evaluating the (7, 4) Collision Risk:\nIf ID 1 *chooses* to ignore the apple at (6, 3) and move UP instead to (7, 4), then:\n*   ID 0 moves DOWN to (7, 4).\n*   **Result: Head-on collision at (7, 4). Both snakes die.**\n\nSince ignoring an immediate apple for an aggressive maneuver is unlikely but possible, moving DOWN risks an immediate head-on collision. **DOWN is too risky.**\n\n#### Evaluating UP vs. RIGHT:\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe moves against the prediction that ID 1 eats (6, 3).\n\n*   **RIGHT (to 8, 5):** This directly progresses the chosen plan toward the safe apple A(8, 9). $H0 \\to (8, 5)$. Target is now 4 steps away.\n*   **UP (to 7, 6):** This moves us sideways relative to the (8, 9) path, requiring an immediate turn RIGHT next turn to resume the plan. $H0 \\to (7, 6)$. Target is still 5 steps away.\n\n**RIGHT** is the optimal choice as it executes the established safe strategy and further separates us from ID 1, who will be preoccupied in the lower-middle territory.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (for T=10, 11, 12):\nContinue the defined path to capture A(8, 9):\n1.  T=9: Move RIGHT (to 8, 5). (Chosen)\n2.  T=10: Move UP (to 8, 6).\n3.  T=11: Move UP (to 8, 7).\n4.  T=12: Move UP (to 8, 8).\n5.  T=13: Move UP (to 8, 9) [Eat].\n\nAfter this, assess the new board state. ID 1 will likely move to (4, 3) next, so we should look at A(2, 8) or A(0, 3). This path keeps us safe and utilizes the upper right side of the board.\n\nRIGHT",

The new body is H1 (6, 3), Neck (7, 3), B2 (7, 2), Tail (6, 2).\n    *   Apples collected: 3.\n*   **Apples Remaining (A):** (8, 9), (2, 8), (0, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2).

Move LEFT to (5, 3).\n2. Move LEFT to (4, 3) [Eats].\n\nPossible path for ID 1 to A(4, 2):\n1. Move DOWN to (6, 2). (Collision with own body (6, 2) if it's still there. Since the tail moved, the new tail is likely (6, 2), so moving DOWN is a collision risk and highly unlikely).\n*Correction on body/tail movement post-eating:* Since ID 1 ate, the tail (6, 2) remains in place for this turn, delaying the tail movement. So, H1 cannot move to (6, 2).\n\nSafe moves for H1: (6, 3) must avoid (7, 3).\n1. **UP (to 6, 4):** Safe. Moves toward center.\n2. **DOWN (to 6, 2):** **DANGER**. Head moves into the current tail segment (6, 2) which remains in place after eating.\n3. **LEFT (to 5, 3):** Safe. Moves onto the path toward A(4, 3) or A(4, 2). **HIGHLY LIKELY.**\n4. **RIGHT (to 7, 3):** **DANGER**. Head moves into the current neck segment.\n\n**Strongest Prediction: ID 1 moves LEFT to (5, 3), targeting A(4, 3) or A(4, 2).**\n\n### Move Evaluation and Collision Check (Assuming ID 1 moves LEFT to (5, 3)):\n\nOur strategy is to continue moving toward A(8, 9) using the path mapped out in the previous turn's rationale:\n1.  T=10: Move UP (to 8, 6).\n2.  T=11: Move UP (to 8, 7).\n3.  T=12: Move UP (to 8, 8).\n4.  T=13: Move UP (to 8, 9) [Eat].\n\n| Our Move (ID 0) | New Head Position (ID 0) | ID 1 Prediction (H1 at 5, 3) | Head-on Risk? | Notes / Outcome |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **UP** | (8, 6) | (5, 3) | None | Safe. Continues path to A(8, 9). |\n| **DOWN** | (8, 4) | (5, 3) | None | Safe, but away from target. |\n| **RIGHT** | (9, 5) | (5, 3) | None | Safe, but moves towards wall. Target is slightly further away. |\n\nMoving **UP** advances the plan directly toward the safe apple A(8, 9) and keeps us separated from the engagement area of Snake \\#1.\n\n### Checking for Secondary Collisions:\n\nSince the entire board between H0 (8, 5) and H1 (6, 3) is clear of snake bodies and they are far apart, there is virtually no risk of collision (either head-on or body insertion) if ID 1 follows the path LEFT to (5, 3).\n\n*   If H1 moves UP to (6, 4), H0 moving UP to (8, 6) is still safe.\n*   If H1 moves to (6, 2) (a slight risk), H0 moving UP to (8, 6) is still safe.\n\nThe optimal move is **UP**.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (for T=11, 12, 13):\nContinue the defined path to capture A(8, 9):\n1. T=11: Move UP (to 8, 7).\n2. T=12: Move UP (to 8, 8).\n3. T=13: Move UP (to 8, 9) [Eat].\nAfter eating A(8, 9), assess the new board state. The next high-value target appears to be A(2, 8).\n\nUP",

It needs to secure more apples to defend its lead, or perhaps seek an elimination if possible, though ID 0 is far away.\n\nThe apple *A(6, 5)* is relatively close (about 3-4 steps, depending on route). *A(2, 8)* and *A(7, 9)* are also available.\n\nPossible attractive moves for H1 (4, 2):\n1. **UP (to 4, 3):** Moves into own body (the neck). **DANGER (Eliminate).**\n2. **DOWN (to 4, 1):** Safe.\n3. **LEFT (to 3, 2):** Safe.\n4. **RIGHT (to 5, 2):** Safe.\n\nSince H1 cannot move UP, its immediate path is restricted. H1 must move away from its body segments: (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2). The closest free area allowing movement toward apples like A(6, 5) or A(2, 8) would be RIGHT to (5, 2), or DOWN to (4, 1) and then around. Moving RIGHT to (5, 2) looks like a good move to try and clear the long segment running along y=3.\n\n**Strongest Prediction: ID 1 moves RIGHT to (5, 2).**\n\n### Move Evaluation and Collision Check (Assuming ID 1 moves RIGHT to 5, 2):\n\nWe have a clear path to A(8, 9).\n\n| Our Move (ID 0) | New Head Position (ID 0) | ID 1 Prediction (H1 at 5, 2) | Head-on Risk? | Notes / Outcome |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **UP** | (8, 9) (Eats A) | (5, 2) | None | **Best move.** Increase score to 3. |\n| **LEFT** | (7, 8) | (5, 2) | None | Safe, but misses immediate apple. |\n| **RIGHT** | (9, 8) | (5, 2) | None | Safe, but misses immediate apple. |\n\nMoving **UP** allows us to capture A(8, 9) and close the gap on Snake 1. This is the optimal move.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (for T=14, 15, 16):\n1. **T=14:** My snake is at (8, 9), length 4, score 3. The remaining easy apple is A(7, 9). Snake 1 remains the primary threat. I must move LEFT (to 7, 9) to secure A(7, 9) and reach score 4.\n2. **T=15:** If I get A(7, 9), I will be at (7, 9), length 5, score 4. I should aim for A(6, 5) or A(2, 8) to contest 5 apples with Snake 1.\n\nUP",

My body segments are at (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (7,2).  \nEnemy snake #0 head is at (8,8), body at (8,7), (8,6).\n\n**Possible moves from (4,2):**  \n- UP \u2192 (4,3): That's my own body segment \u2192 **DEATH**  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,1): Empty cell \u2192 **SAFE**  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,2): Empty cell \u2192 **SAFE**  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,2): Empty cell \u2192 **SAFE**  \n\nSo UP is immediately eliminated.\n\n**Enemy snake #0 possible moves from (8,8):**  \nIts body is at (8,7) and (8,6), so it cannot move DOWN (into its own body).  \nPossible safe moves for enemy: UP to (8,9), LEFT to (7,8), RIGHT to (9,8).  \nNote: There are apples at (8,9) and (7,9) near the enemy.\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**  \nIf I move RIGHT to (5,2), the enemy would need to move to (5,2) simultaneously for a head-on collision, which is impossible from its position.  \nIf I move LEFT to (3,2), same logic.  \nIf I move DOWN to (4,1), also safe from head-on collision.\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nApples at: (8,9), (2,8), (0,3), (7,9), (6,5).  \nClosest to me: (6,5) is 3 units away (Manhattan distance), (0,3) is 4 units away, (2,8) is 6 units away.  \nMoving DOWN to (4,1) takes me further from most apples.  \nMoving LEFT to (3,2) moves slightly closer to (0,3).  \nMoving RIGHT to (5,2) moves slightly closer to (6,5).\n\n**Future mobility:**  \nFrom (4,1): Possible moves UP (back to (4,2)), DOWN to (4,0), LEFT to (3,1), RIGHT to (5,1). All four might be safe depending on future body positions.  \nFrom (3,2): Possible moves UP to (3,3) - empty, DOWN to (3,1) - empty, LEFT to (2,2) - empty, RIGHT to (4,2) - currently my neck but will be empty next turn since I'm moving. Actually, if I move LEFT, my neck at (4,2) will become empty as my body follows. So RIGHT would be into my current head position which becomes empty next turn \u2192 safe. Good mobility.  \nFrom (5,2): Possible moves UP to (5,3) - my body currently there but will shift, DOWN to (5,1) - empty, LEFT to (4,2) - empty next turn, RIGHT to (6,2) - empty. Also good mobility.\n\n**Enemy threat assessment:**  \nEnemy is far away at (8,8), no immediate threat of collision.\n\n**Strategic note for future self:**  \n- I have 5 apples vs enemy's 2, so I'm leading. Survival is key.  \n- My body forms a barrier on row 3 from x=4 to x=7 and at (7,2).  \n- Avoid getting trapped in corners. Currently central position is good.  \n- Consider heading toward apple at (6,5) or (0,3) but maintain escape routes.\n\n**Decision:**  \nBoth LEFT and RIGHT seem safe and maintain good future options. RIGHT moves me slightly closer to apple at (6,5), which seems reachable without immediate danger. LEFT moves toward (0,3) but that's near the edge.\n\nI'll choose RIGHT to move toward the apple cluster in the upper right while keeping central mobility.\n\nRIGHT",

Clears y=2 for future use.\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 2):** Collision with own body segment (neck). **DANGER (Eliminate).**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 2):** Safe.

The easiest remaining apples are A(4, 9) and A(2, 8). I should aim for A(4, 9) first, requiring 3 LEFT moves. Snake 1 is likely moving toward A(6, 5) or A(2, 8) if it moved RIGHT to (6, 2). I must continue horizontal movement to secure (4, 9).\n2.  **T=16:** Move LEFT to (6, 9).\n3.  **T=17:** Move LEFT to (5, 9).\n4.  **T=18:** Move LEFT to (4, 9) (Eats A).\n\nLEFT",

Safe. This continues my high-level plan.\n\n### Enemy Prediction (ID 1 at 6, 2):\n\nID 1 is at (6, 2), length 6, score 5.

It must move away temporarily.\n1. H1 moves RIGHT (to 7, 2): Puts it in a safe position, maybe preparing to move up later, or down/right towards the bottom corner.\n2. H1 moves DOWN (to 6, 1): Moves further away from all apples but maintains safety.\n\n**Strongest Prediction: ID 1 moves RIGHT to (7, 2)** to expand options.\n\n### Collision Check (ID 0 H0 at 7, 9; ID 1 H1 at 7, 2):\n\nGiven the significant vertical and horizontal separation (7, 9) vs. (7, 2), there is virtually no head-on collision threat. The minimum distance is $9-2=7$ units.\n\n### Move Evaluation:\n\nSince I cannot move RIGHT to the apple at (9, 9) (blocked by my neck), and A(4, 9) is the next most accessible apple, moving **LEFT** is the necessary step to execute the planned apple acquisition sequence.\n\n| Our Move (ID 0) | New Head Position (ID 0) | H1 Prediction (7, 2) | Head-on Risk? | Follow-up Apple | Notes |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **LEFT** | (6, 9) | (7, 2) | None | A(4, 9) (2 steps) | Best strategic move. |\n| **DOWN** | (7, 8) | (7, 2) | None | Far away | Moves away from high-priority targets. |\n\nI will move **LEFT** to continue the pursuit of A(4, 9).\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (for T=16, 17, 18):\n1.  **T=16:** Move LEFT to (5, 9). Still aiming for A(4, 9).\n2.  **T=17:** Move LEFT to (4, 9). **Eats A(4, 9)**. Score 5.\n3.  **T=18:** Now at (4, 9), length 6. Next goal is A(9, 9) or A(2, 8). If safe, move UP (to 4, 9 - wait, UP is blocked since 9 is top edge, so this must be a safe spot). If A(9, 9) is available, move RIGHT repeatedly, or drop down and seek A(2, 8) or A(6, 5).\n\nLEFT",

My body runs: head (6,2), then (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3).  \nEnemy snake #0 head is at **(7,9)**, body at (8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6).\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Immediate safety check from (6,2):**  \n- **UP** to (6,3): That\u2019s my own body segment (currently the tail) \u2192 **DEATH**  \n- **DOWN** to (6,1): Empty cell \u2192 **SAFE**  \n- **LEFT** to (5,2): That\u2019s my own body segment (the neck) \u2192 **DEATH**  \n- **RIGHT** to (7,2): Empty cell \u2192 **SAFE**\n\nSo **UP** and **LEFT** are immediately fatal. Only **DOWN** and **RIGHT** are viable.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy threat assessment:**  \nEnemy head at (7,9). Its possible moves:  \n- UP to (7,10) \u2192 off board \u2192 death  \n- DOWN to (7,8) \u2192 empty  \n- LEFT to (6,9) \u2192 empty (there\u2019s an apple at (6,5) but that\u2019s far)  \n- RIGHT to (8,9) \u2192 its own body \u2192 death  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves are DOWN to (7,8) and LEFT to (6,9). It will likely go DOWN toward the apple at (7,9) is already taken? Wait, the board shows an apple at (7,9) is *not* listed in the apples list (apples are at (2,8), (0,3), (6,5), (4,9), (9,9)). The board drawing shows \u2018A\u2019 at (7,9) \u2013 that must be a mistake in the drawing vs. the list. I\u2019ll trust the list: no apple at (7,9). So enemy might go DOWN or LEFT, but not into my immediate area.\n\n**Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \nI\u2019m at (6,2), enemy at (7,9). No overlap in possible move destinations. Safe.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nApples: (2,8), (0,3), (6,5), (4,9), (9,9).  \nFrom (6,2):  \n- (6,5) is Manhattan distance 3 (same x, up 3).  \n- (0,3) is distance 9.  \n- (2,8) is distance 10.  \n- (4,9) is distance 11.  \n- (9,9) is distance 10.\n\nMoving **RIGHT** to (7,2) keeps same distance to (6,5) but moves slightly away in x.  \nMoving **DOWN** to (6,1) increases distance to (6,5) to 4.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility:**  \nFrom **(7,2)** (if I go RIGHT):  \n- UP to (7,3): empty (my body at (6,3) will shift away).  \n- DOWN to (7,1): empty.  \n- LEFT to (6,2): will be empty (my current head).  \n- RIGHT to (8,2): empty.  \nAll four directions likely safe next turn. Good.\n\nFrom **(6,1)** (if I go DOWN):  \n- UP to (6,2): empty.  \n- DOWN to (6,0): empty.  \n- LEFT to (5,1): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (7,1): empty.  \nAlso good mobility.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019m leading 5 apples to 4. Survival is priority. My body forms a barrier along row 3 from x=4 to x=6 and at (4,2), (5,2). I should avoid getting trapped by it. The apple at (6,5) is the closest. Moving RIGHT positions me to possibly go UP later toward it while staying central. Moving DOWN retreats and wastes a turn. Also, moving RIGHT keeps me farther from the enemy, who is in the top-right corner.\n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT gets me away from my own body cluster and maintains good mobility while keeping the apple at (6,5) reachable soon.\n\nRIGHT",

Its possible moves:  \n- UP to (6,10) \u2192 off board \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN to (6,8) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT to (5,9) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT to (7,9) \u2192 its own body segment (7,9) \u2192 death.  \nSo enemy's safe moves are DOWN and LEFT. It is far away (Manhattan distance 7 from me), so no immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nApples: (2,8), (0,3), (6,5), (4,9), (9,9).  \nFrom (7,2):  \n- (6,5) is Manhattan distance 4 (left 1, up 3).  \n- (0,3) is distance 8.  \n- (2,8) is distance 9.  \n- (4,9) is distance 8.  \n- (9,9) is distance 9.  \nClosest apple is (6,5).\n\n**Future mobility and strategy:**  \nMy body forms a barrier: [(6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (5,3)]. Moving LEFT to (6,2) would put me back onto a cell that will be empty, but it's adjacent to my body segments at (5,2) and (6,3). That could reduce future options. Moving UP to (7,3) gets me closer to the apple (6,5) (y+1). Moving RIGHT to (8,2) moves away from the closest apple. Moving DOWN to (7,1) also moves away.\n\nI should aim toward (6,5). The direct path would be UP then LEFT. Starting with UP seems good. Also, moving UP opens future options: from (7,3), I can go LEFT, UP, or RIGHT next turn.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nI'm leading 5-4. Prioritize survival and approach the apple at (6,5). Avoid moving into areas where my long body might trap me. Keep an eye on enemy #0 in the top-right; it might head for apples at (4,9) or (9,9).\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gets me closer to the nearest apple while maintaining good mobility and staying safe.\n\nUP",

This is the optimal move.\n\n### Enemy Prediction (ID 1 at 7, 3):\n\nID 1 is at (7, 3). Its neck is (7, 2).

This is the shortest path and therefore the most probable move.\n\nPrediction Cautiously: ID 1 moves **LEFT to (6, 3)** to pursue A(6, 5).\n\n### Collision Check:\n\nMy move: **LEFT to (4, 9)** (Apple capture).\nEnemy predicted new cells: (7, 4), (6, 3), or (8, 3).\n\nThere is no risk of collision (4, 9) is nowhere near the enemy's potential moves.\n\n### Move Evaluation:\n\nMoving **LEFT** secures an apple, ties the score, and extends my snake's length, setting me up for the next goal. Since this move is safe and directly achieves the immediate objective, it is the best choice.\n\n---\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (for T=18, 19, 20):\n1. **T=18:** Now at (4, 9), length 6, score 5. Next goal is A(2, 8) (2 steps away). Move DOWN to (4, 8).\n2. **T=19:** At (4, 8). Move LEFT to (3, 8).\n3. **T=20:** At (3, 8). Move DOWN to (3, 7). (This strategy needs slight adjustment, as moving to (3, 8) then DOWN to (3, 7) doesn't capture A(2, 8). Instead: T=19: Move LEFT to (2, 9). T=20: Move DOWN to (2, 8) to capture A(2, 8)).\n\nRevised Plan:\n1. **T=18:** Aim UP/LEFT for A(2, 8). Since H0 at (4, 9), move LEFT to (3, 9).\n2. **T=19:** At (3, 9). Move DOWN to (3, 8).\n3. **T=20:** At (3, 8). Move LEFT to (2, 8). **Eats A(2, 8)**. (Or, move DOWN/LEFT from (3, 9) to (2, 9) then to (2, 8).)\n\nThe path (4, 9) -> (3, 9) -> (2, 9) -> (2, 8) (if the snake moves right through (2, 9)) is safer than going down into the middle of the board prematurely.\n*Wait, A(2, 8) is only 1 step away from (3, 8). Path: (4, 9) -> (3, 9) -> (3, 8) -> (2, 8).*\n\nPlan stands:\n1. **T=18:** Move LEFT to (3, 9).\n2. **T=19:** Move DOWN to (3, 8).\n3. **T=20:** Move LEFT to (2, 8). **Eats A(2, 8)**.\n---\n\nLEFT",

However, my body will shift forward this turn, so (7,2) will become my new neck, and the tail (4,3) will move. Since (7,2) is my own body and I'd be moving into it, this would kill me. **NOT SAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (6,3): Empty. **SAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (8,3): Empty. **SAFE**.\n\nSo **DOWN is eliminated** because it's moving backwards into my own body (the segment immediately behind my head). That's a death rule.\n\n**Enemy threat assessment:**\nEnemy snake #0 head at (5,9). Its possible moves from (5,9):\n- UP to (5,10) \u2192 off board \u2192 death.\n- DOWN to (5,8) \u2192 empty.\n- LEFT to (4,9) \u2192 contains apple A, but also possible collision with my future move? I'm far away.\n- RIGHT to (6,9) \u2192 its own body segment (6,9) \u2192 death.\nSo its safe moves are DOWN and LEFT. It's far away (Manhattan distance 6 from me), so no immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Apple proximity and strategy:**\nApples: (2,8), (0,3), (6,5), (4,9), (9,9).\nFrom my head (7,3):\n- (6,5) is distance 3 (left 1, up 2).\n- (0,3) is distance 7.\n- (2,8) is distance 8.\n- (4,9) is distance 7.\n- (9,9) is distance 8.\nClosest apple is **(6,5)**.\n\nTo get closer to (6,5), I should move **LEFT** (to (6,3)) or **UP** (to (7,4)). Moving LEFT reduces the x-distance to 0 and y-distance to 2. Moving UP keeps x-distance at 1 and reduces y-distance to 1. Both are good. However, moving UP to (7,4) might be slightly safer for future mobility, as it opens more central space.\n\n**Future mobility check:**\nFrom (6,3) after LEFT:\n- Next moves: UP to (6,4), DOWN to (6,2), LEFT to (5,3), RIGHT to (7,3).\n- DOWN (6,2) is currently my body segment, but will it be empty next turn? My body will shift, so (6,2) becomes part of my neck? Actually, my current body is [(7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (4,3)]. After moving LEFT to (6,3), my new body becomes [(6,3), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)] and tail (4,3) disappears. So (6,2) remains occupied. So DOWN from (6,3) would be into my own body next turn. That's dangerous. Similarly, RIGHT to (7,3) would be into my current head position, which will become my neck, so also occupied. So from (6,3), only UP and LEFT might be safe next turn. That's limited.\n\nFrom (7,4) after UP:\n- Next moves: UP to (7,5), DOWN to (7,3), LEFT to (6,4), RIGHT to (8,4).\n- DOWN to (7,3) will be my neck, so occupied \u2192 not safe.\n- So safe options: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. That's three safe moves, better mobility.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**\nI'm leading 5-4. Prioritize survival and approach the apple at (6,5). Moving UP gives better mobility and keeps me closer to the center. Next turn, from (7,4), I can consider LEFT towards (6,5) or continue UP. Avoid boxing myself in. Enemy #0 is in the top-right and may go for (4,9) or (9,9). No immediate threat.\n\n**Decision:**\nBetween the two safe moves that get me closer to the nearest apple (LEFT and UP), UP offers better future mobility. RIGHT moves away from the apple. So **UP** is the best choice.\n\nUP",

Its neck is (7, 3).\nBody coordinates: (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2).\nEnemy is currently positioned in the middle right, with body segments potentially blocking column 7 (down) and row 2.\n\nSafe moves for H1: UP (to 7, 5), LEFT (to 6, 4), RIGHT (to 8, 4), DOWN (to 7, 3) is collision with neck. **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\nApples near H1:\n*   A3 (6, 5): 1 step (LEFT) + 1 step (UP) = 2 steps.\n*   A4 (9, 9): 2 steps (RIGHT) + 5 steps (UP) = 7 steps.\n*   A2 (0, 3): Far, 7 steps.\n\nGiven the shortest distance, H1 is highly likely to move towards A3 (6, 5).\nPreferred H1 moves:\n1. **UP (to 7, 5):** Shortens distance to A3's y-coordinate. Path: (7, 5) -> (6, 5).\n2. **LEFT (to 6, 4):** Shortens distance to A3's x-coordinate. Path: (6, 4) -> (6, 5).\n\nID 1 is expected to move **UP to (7, 5)** or **LEFT to (6, 4)**.\n\n### Collision Check:\n\nMy intended move: **LEFT to (3, 9)**.\nEnemy potential new cells: (7, 5) or (6, 4).\n\nThere is no immediate collision risk. H0 is in the top left, H1 is in the center-right.\n\n### Move Evaluation:\n\nMove **LEFT** to (3, 9) is safe and continues the path towards A1 (2, 8), which keeps the snake near the safe boundaries for future moves.\n\n---\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (for T=19, 20, 21):\n1. **T=18:** Move LEFT to (3, 9). (Executed)\n2. **T=19:** From (3, 9), move DOWN to (3, 8). This is 1 step closer to A1 (2, 8).\n3. **T=20:** From (3, 8), move LEFT to (2, 8), consuming A1. Score 6-5. New apples will spawn.\n4. **T=21:** Based on new apple locations and H1 movement. If H1 takes A3 (6, 5), the next closest apple to H0 will become the target.\n---\nLEFT",

SAFE.\n\nSo DOWN is eliminated.\n\n**Enemy threat assessment:**\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (4,9).

Actually, my current body is [(7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2)]. After moving LEFT to (6,4), my new body becomes [(6,4), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2)] and tail (4,2) disappears. So (6,3) remains empty. Wait, (6,3) is not in my new body. So DOWN might be safe.\n   - RIGHT to (7,4) will be my neck \u2192 occupied \u2192 not safe.\n   - So safe next moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).\n   - UP goes directly to apple (6,5).\n\n3. **RIGHT to (8,4):**\n   Next moves: UP to (8,5), DOWN to (8,3), LEFT to (7,4), RIGHT to (9,4)\n   - LEFT to (7,4) will be my neck \u2192 occupied \u2192 not safe.\n   - So safe next moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).\n   - Moves away from nearest apple.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT get me closer to apple (6,5) and offer good mobility. UP gives me direct access to (6,5) via LEFT next turn. LEFT gives me direct access via UP next turn.\n\n**Long-term plan note:**\nI'm tied 5-5 with snake #0. The apple at (6,5) is highly contested territory. Snake #0 is far away at (4,9), but could potentially head toward (6,5) over several turns. Moving UP to (7,5) keeps me central and gives flexibility: next turn I can go LEFT to (6,5) to eat the apple if still there, or continue UP/right based on the board. Moving LEFT to (6,4) also works but might box me slightly against the left wall. Given that (6,5) is just above-left from my current position, UP then LEFT seems slightly more natural than LEFT then UP.\n\n**Decision:**\nUP offers good mobility and positions me perfectly to take apple (6,5) next turn if I choose LEFT. It also keeps me away from my own body and any immediate threats.\n\nUP",

My immediate safe moves will be UP, DOWN, LEFT. Avoid moving RIGHT into my own neck. The board still has apples at (2,8), (0,3), (9,9), (5,1). Apple (5,1) is south-west, but my long body along column 7 and row 2 might block some paths. Consider heading toward (9,9) or (2,8) while maintaining space.\n\nGiven the clear immediate gain and safety, LEFT to eat the apple is the best move.\n\nLEFT",

Moving **LEFT** consumes this apple immediately. This is the highest priority move, as it ties the score and maintains density control in the top area.\n\n### Enemy Prediction (ID 1 at 6, 5):\n\nAssuming Snake 1 is now at H1 (6, 5) after consuming the apple that was there (A3 from last turn), and their new body segment is (7, 5).\n\nSafe moves for H1 (6, 5).

It might move UP to (6, 6) or DOWN to (6, 4) to maintain central position or go towards the bottom apples.\n\nIf H1 moves to (6, 6), (6, 4), or (5, 5), none of these moves interfere with H0 moving LEFT to (2, 8).\n\n### Collision Check:\n\nMy intended move: **LEFT to (2, 8)** (consumes A1).\nEnemy potential new cells: (6, 6), (6, 4), (5, 5).\n\nNo collision possible. The snakes are far apart.\n\n### Move Evaluation:\n\nMoving **LEFT** consumes the immediate apple, bringing my score to 6, tying the lead, and increasing my length. This is the optimal, safe, immediate action.\n\n---\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (for T=21, 22, 23):\n1. **T=20:** Move LEFT to (2, 8), consuming A1. Score 6-6. New head is (2, 8).\n2. **T=21 onwards:** H0 is now positioned well to move towards A2 (0, 3) or newly spawned apples in the top-left quadrant. The longest path is currently spanning the top wall. We should try to clear this region (possibly by moving down the left side) before looping back to the center or cutting off H1.\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

NOT SAFE.\n\nSo RIGHT is eliminated.\n\n**Enemy threat assessment:**\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (3,8). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (3,9): its own body (3,9) \u2192 death.\n- DOWN to (3,7): empty.\n- LEFT to (2,8): contains apple (2,8) \u2014 eating allowed.\n- RIGHT to (4,8): empty.\nSo it can move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Manhattan distance from my head (6,5) to (3,8) is 6. No immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\nRemaining apples: (2,8), (0,3), (9,9), (5,1), (6,0)\nFrom my head (6,5):\n- (5,1): distance 5\n- (6,0): distance 5\n- (2,8): distance 7\n- (9,9): distance 8\n- (0,3): distance 8\n\nClosest are (5,1) and (6,0) \u2014 both south.\n\n**Future mobility analysis after each safe move:**\n\n1. **UP to (6,6):**\n   Next moves: UP to (6,7), DOWN to (6,5), LEFT to (5,6), RIGHT to (7,6)\n   - DOWN to (6,5) will be my neck \u2192 not safe.\n   - Safe: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).\n   - Moves away from closest apples.\n\n2. **DOWN to (6,4):**\n   Next moves: UP to (6,5) (neck), DOWN to (6,3), LEFT to (5,4), RIGHT to (7,4)\n   - UP not safe.\n   - Safe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).\n   - Gets closer to (5,1) and (6,0).\n\n3. **LEFT to (5,5):**\n   Next moves: UP to (5,6), DOWN to (5,4), LEFT to (4,5), RIGHT to (6,5) (neck)\n   - RIGHT not safe.\n   - Safe: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).\n   - Slightly closer to (5,1) but also central.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- I have a lead (6 apples vs 5). Growing longer reduces mobility, but eating apples is the win condition.\n- The enemy is far north-east, currently heading toward apple (2,8) if it moves LEFT.\n- My body forms an L-shape along column 7 and row 2, which could block paths south. Moving DOWN or LEFT opens routes toward the southern apples (5,1) and (6,0).\n- Moving UP keeps me safe but doesn\u2019t progress toward apples.\n- DOWN seems best: it maintains safe options and moves directly toward the cluster of apples at (5,1) and (6,0), while also keeping distance from the enemy.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turns:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (6,4), aim to safely approach (5,1) or (6,0). Watch for enemy movement toward (2,8). Avoid getting trapped in the bottom-left corner; keep escape routes open. My long body along row 2 might become a barrier\u2014consider circling around.\n\nGiven the clear progression toward apples while maintaining safety, **DOWN** is the best move.\n\nDOWN",

(2 moves)\n\nChoosing UP seems slightly better as it positions the snake along the wall, maximizing future movement space (LEFT would put H0 next to the wall on the left side, slightly constricting movement options compared to being on the top edge).\n\n### Enemy Prediction (ID 1 at 6, 4):\n\nH1 is at (6, 4). Neck is (6, 5).\nSafe moves for H1: UP (6, 5 - collision), DOWN (6, 3), LEFT (5, 4), RIGHT (7, 4 - collision).\nWait, the enemy body is [(6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2)].\n\n1. **UP (to 6, 5):** Collision with neck (6, 5). **DANGER (Eliminate)**. (The body list starts with the segment immediately following the head).\n2. **DOWN (to 6, 3):** Safe. Clears path to A4 (6, 0).\n3. **LEFT (to 5, 4):** Safe. Clears path to A3 (5, 1).\n4. **RIGHT (to 7, 4):** Collision with body segment (7, 4). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\nH1 must choose between DOWN (towards (6, 0)) or LEFT (towards (5, 1)). Both apples are 3 steps away. Since H1 is slightly closer to (6, 0) via a straight vertical path, DOWN seems the most logical move for H1.\n\nIf H1 moves DOWN to (6, 3), it does not influence my movement toward A5 (1, 9).\n\n### Collision Check:\n\nMy intended move: **UP to (2, 9)**.\nEnemy likely move: DOWN to (6, 3) or LEFT to (5, 4).\n\nNo head-to-head collision risk. No intersection risk with static body cells.\n\n### Move Evaluation:\n\nMoving **UP** to (2, 9) is safe and prepares H0 for consuming A5 (1, 9) in the next turn. This secures another apple quickly and keeps my snake in a favorable position along the top edge of the board.\n\n---\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (for T=22, 23, 24):\n1. **T=21:** Move UP to (2, 9). Positioned to consume A5.\n2. **T=22:** Move LEFT to (1, 9), consuming A5. Score 7-6. Head at (1, 9).\n3. **T=23 onwards:** The body is primarily spanning (3, 8) to (7, 9). We should secure A2 (9, 9) if possible, or move down the left edge towards A1 (0, 3) if A2 is too risky due to Snake 1's position. Priority is to capture remaining apples and maintain a safe, open movement path.\n\n\nUP",

No immediate head-on collision risk (it would take at least 4 moves to reach me).\n\n**Apple proximity from (6,4):**\n- (5,1): distance |6-5|+|4-1| = 1+3 = 4\n- (6,0): distance |6-6|+|4-0| = 0+4 = 4\n- (0,3): distance 6+1 = 7\n- (1,9): distance 5+5 = 10\n- (9,9): distance 3+5 = 8\n\nClosest apples are (5,1) and (6,0), both south.\n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**\n\n1. **DOWN to (6,3):**\n   Next moves from (6,3):\n   - UP to (6,4) \u2192 my neck?

So UP to (6,4) would be my own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n   - DOWN to (6,2): That's my own tail segment? Let's check: after move, tail is at (6,2). But moving onto it would kill me (tail is part of body). So DOWN unsafe.\n   - LEFT to (5,3): empty.\n   - RIGHT to (7,3): my own body (sixth segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n   So only LEFT would be safe next turn.

Good mobility.\n\nAlso, LEFT moves me closer to apple (5,1) (distance reduces from 4 to |5-5|+|4-1| = 3).\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- Enemy is far away, no immediate threat.\n- My body forms a sort of C-shape around column 7 and row 2-5. Moving LEFT opens central area and keeps many options.\n- Moving DOWN reduces future options drastically (only LEFT safe next turn), which could corner me.\n- Apple (5,1) is close and reachable via LEFT then DOWN moves.\n- Apple (6,0) is also close but requires moving into column 6, which is partly occupied by my body.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turns:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (5,4), aim to go DOWN toward (5,1) while avoiding trapping myself. Keep an eye on enemy movement toward apple (1,9) or (0,3). My long body along column 7 and row 2 may act as a barrier; I can loop around it if needed. Prioritize keeping at least 2 safe moves after each step.\n\nGiven the better mobility and progress toward the closest apple, **LEFT** is the safer and more strategic choice.\n\nLEFT",

(x=0 to 9 is okay)\n*   Own body: (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9).\n*   Enemy body: (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2).\n*   Enemies: H1 is at (5, 4).\n\n1.  **UP (to 2, 10):** Off board. **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n2.  **DOWN (to 2, 8):** Collision with own neck. **DANGER (Eliminate)**. (The last move was UP to (2, 9), so (2, 8) is the cell H0 just left.)\n3.  **LEFT (to 1, 9):** Moves onto A5. Safe move, guaranteed apple. **SAFE**.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 3, 9):** Collision with own body (segment previously at (3, 9)). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\n**Wait: Re-evaluating Own Body Collision.**\nThe previous body was [(2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9)].\nAfter moving UP to (2, 9), the new head is (2, 9).\nThe segment immediately behind the head is (2, 8). Moving DOWN to (2, 8) is a collision with the neck.\nThe rest of the body maintains its shape: (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9).\n*   RIGHT to (3, 9) would hit the third segment (which was at (3, 9) and is now stationary or moving based on the size change). Since an apple was *not* consumed in the last move (T=21), the tail (6, 9) is removed this turn, and the body shifts forward.\n\n**Let's retrace snake body movement:**\nT=21 Head: (2, 8). Body: [(3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9)]. Length 7. (No apple consumed at T=21).\n*   T=22 Head moves to (2, 9).\n*   New Body segments (excluding tail): (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9).\n*   The tail (7, 9) is removed.\n\nCells occupied by my snake *before* H0 moves: (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9). Wait, this is wrong. The provided current state body list is already the *new* body list for T=22 *after* the move was made at T=21.\n\n**Current State (T=22):**\nHead: (2, 9)\nBody: [(2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9)]. Length 7.\n\nRethink Safety for H0 at (2, 9):\n1.  **UP (to 2, 10):** Off board. **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n2.  **DOWN (to 2, 8):** Collision with neck (2, 8). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n3.  **LEFT (to 1, 9):** Moves onto A5. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 3, 9):** Collision with body segment (3, 9). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\n**Only one safe move remains: LEFT.**\n\n### Move Evaluation:\n\nMoving **LEFT** to (1, 9) consumes A5 (1, 9). This is the only safe move, and it secures an apple, increasing my score to 7 and my length to 8. This is an easy decision.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (for T=23, 24, 25):\n\n1. **T=22:** Move LEFT to (1, 9), consuming A5. Score 7-6. Head at (1, 9).\n2. **T=23:** Head is at (1, 9). Neck is (2, 9). Next goal is A2 (9, 9). The top edge is open. Need to move RIGHT aggressively.\n    *   Safe moves: DOWN (1, 8), RIGHT (2, 9, which is the neck). UP/LEFT are borders.\n    *   Need to re-evaluate turn structure on collision with neck. If I move RIGHT to (2, 9), it is the neck segment, and I die. Wait, this isn't true if the snake consumed an apple, but it did this turn.\n\nAssume T=22 move is LEFT to (1, 9), apple is consumed.\nNew Head (T=23): (1, 9).\nNew Body (T=23): [(2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9)]. Length 8. No tail removed.\n\nFrom (1, 9) at T=23:\n* UP/LEFT: Borders.\n* DOWN to (1, 8): Safe.\n* RIGHT to (2, 9): Collision with neck. **DANGER.**\n\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 8), I am safe, but I pull away from A2 (9, 9).\nIf H1 moves aggressively towards the top right, I might lose A2. Let's see H1's expected movement.\n\nH1 at (5, 4). Possible safe moves: DOWN to (5, 3) or LEFT to (4, 4). (Assuming H1 didn't consume an apple targeting A3/A4). H1 is likely moving towards A3 (5, 1) or A4 (6, 0). If H1 targets A3, T=23 H1 at (5, 3), T=24 H1 at (5, 2), T=25 H1 at (5, 1) (Eats A3). This keeps H1 away from the top right for a while.\n\nSince the move RIGHT is immediately fatal next turn, I must move DOWN to (1, 8).\n\n3. **T=24:** H0 at (1, 8). Neck (1, 9).\n    * Safe moves: UP (to 1, 9 - neck), DOWN (to 1, 7), LEFT (to 0, 8), RIGHT (to 2, 8).\n    * Moving LEFT to (0, 8) sets up a sweep along the left wall towards A1 (0, 3).\n    * Moving RIGHT to (2, 8) keeps options to move toward the center/right.\n\nI will prioritize A1 (0, 3) next since A2 (9, 9) requires crossing the highly utilized (2, 9) to (6, 9) path where my body currently lies, which is complex immediately after consuming an apple. Sweeping down the left side is safer.\n\nPlan: T=22 LEFT (Eat A5). T=23 DOWN (to 1, 8). T=24 LEFT (to 0, 8). T=25 DOWN (to 0, 7) ... towards A1.\n\nLEFT",

SAFE.\n- **DOWN** to (5,3): Empty. SAFE.\n- **LEFT** to (4,4): Empty. SAFE.\n- **RIGHT** to (6,4): That's my own body (second segment, my neck from last turn). Moving into it would kill me \u2192 NOT SAFE.\n\nSo unsafe moves: RIGHT. Safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Enemy threat assessment:**\nEnemy #0 head at (2,9). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (2,10): Off-board \u2192 death.\n- DOWN to (2,8): Its own body (second segment) \u2192 death.\n- LEFT to (1,9): Apple at (1,9) \u2192 would eat and grow.\n- RIGHT to (3,9): Its own body (third segment) \u2192 death.\nSo enemy's only safe move is LEFT to (1,9). That means next turn its head will likely be at (1,9).\n\nManhattan distance from my head (5,4) to enemy's projected next head (1,9) is |5-1|+|4-9| = 4+5 = 9. No immediate collision risk.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\nApples at: (0,3), (9,9), (5,1), (6,0), (1,9).\nFrom my head (5,4):\n- (5,1): distance |5-5|+|4-1| = 0+3 = 3\n- (6,0): distance |5-6|+|4-0| = 1+4 = 5\n- (0,3): distance 5+1 = 6\n- (1,9): distance 4+5 = 9 (but enemy heading there)\n- (9,9): distance 4+5 = 9\n\nClosest apple is (5,1) directly below me.\n\n**Future mobility analysis for each safe move:**\n\n1. **UP to (5,5):**\n   Next moves from (5,5):\n   - UP to (5,6): Empty.\n   - DOWN to (5,4): My neck (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n   - LEFT to (4,5): Empty.\n   - RIGHT to (6,5): My body (third segment) \u2192 unsafe.\n   So 2 safe options (UP, LEFT). Moderate mobility.\n\n2. **DOWN to (5,3):**\n   Next moves from (5,3):\n   - UP to (5,4): My neck \u2192 unsafe.\n   - DOWN to (5,2): Empty.\n   - LEFT to (4,3): Empty.\n   - RIGHT to (6,3): Empty.\n   So 3 safe options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Good mobility, and moves directly toward closest apple (5,1).\n\n3. **LEFT to (4,4):**\n   Next moves from (4,4):\n   - UP to (4,5): Empty.\n   - DOWN to (4,3): Empty.\n   - LEFT to (3,4): Empty.\n   - RIGHT to (5,4): My neck \u2192 unsafe.\n   So 3 safe options (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Good mobility, but moves away from the closest apple.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- Enemy is moving to (1,9) to eat that apple, growing to length 7. We're tied at 6 apples currently.\n- Apple (5,1) is closest and uncontested. Moving DOWN gets me closer to it.\n- My body forms a barrier along column 6-7 and rows 2-5. Moving DOWN keeps me central and avoids getting trapped near edges.\n- Moving DOWN gives excellent next-turn mobility (3 safe directions).\n- Moving LEFT also gives good mobility but takes me slightly away from the primary target apple.\n- UP gives fewer options and moves away from apples.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turns:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (5,3), next turn I should continue DOWN toward (5,1) if safe, while monitoring enemy movement. Avoid moving into column 6 where my body is. Keep options open by not boxing myself against my own body or walls. If enemy moves toward central apples later, I may need to pivot.\n\nGiven the need to collect apples to win and maintain mobility, **DOWN** is the best choice.\n\nDOWN",

(Since an apple was eaten last turn, the tail segment was retained, and the neck is still 1 segment away from the head's previous position).\n\n### Enemy Movement Prediction (H1 at 5, 3):\n\nH1 is currently closer to A3 (5, 1) and A4 (6, 0).\nPossible safe moves for H1:\n*   LEFT (4, 3): Safe, keeps distance from walls/bodies.\n*   DOWN (5, 2): Safe, moves towards A3 (5, 1).\n*   RIGHT (6, 3): Safe, somewhat towards A4 (6, 0).\n*   UP (5, 4): Collision with neck. **DANGER**.\n\nIf H1 wants A3, it will move DOWN to (5, 2). If H1 wants A4, it will move RIGHT or DOWN. Since A3 is closer (2 steps) and A4 is 3 diagonal steps away, H1 is highly likely to move DOWN to (5, 2). This keeps H1 far away from the top boundary.\n\n### Move Evaluation for ID 0:\n\nWe have two safe moves: LEFT (to 0, 9, capturing A5) and DOWN (to 1, 8).\n\n1.  **LEFT (to 0, 9):** Captures A5. Score increases to 8. Length increases to 9. This maintains our lead.\n2.  **DOWN (to 1, 8):** Moves into free space. Safe, but misses an immediate apple.\n\nGiven the immediate availability of an apple (A5 at 0, 9), and the importance of maintaining an apple lead over Snake #1 (currently 7-6), taking the guaranteed food is the superior choice, especially since it's perfectly safe.\n\n**Check for Head-on Collision:**\nH0 moves LEFT to (0, 9). H1 is likely moving DOWN near (5, 2) or LEFT to (4, 3) and is too far away for collision. Safe move.\n\nDecision: **LEFT**.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (for T=24, 25, 26):\n\n1. **T=23:** Move LEFT to (0, 9), consuming A5. Score 8-6. Length 9.

No potential for head-on collision or collision with the enemy's projected path.\n\nThe forced move DOWN aligns with our long-term strategy of sweeping down the left side of the board towards A1 (0, 3) and A5 (0, 1).\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (for T=25, 26, 27):\n\n1. **T=24:** Move DOWN to (0, 8). Score 8-6 (assuming H1 eats A3). Length 9. Head at (0, 8).\n2. **T=25:** Head at (0, 8). Neck (0, 9). Must move DOWN to (0, 7) or, if safe, explore right. Given the high-X occupancy of our body, continuing down the left wall is the safest path to A1 (0, 3).\n3. **T=26:** Move DOWN to (0, 6).\n4. **T=27:** Move DOWN to (0, 5).\n5. **T=28:** Move DOWN to (0, 4).\n6. **T=29:** Move DOWN to (0, 3), capturing A1.

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current board state and available moves step by step.\n\n**Current position:** Head at (5,2), body segments: (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4).  \n**Apples:** (0,3), (9,9), (5,1), (6,0), (0,1).  \n**Enemy snake (#0):** Head at (0,9), body extends east along row 9 and down/around.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Check each direction for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (5,3) \u2192 That's my own body segment \u2192 **DEATH** \u2192 Eliminated.\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 Apple at (5,1) \u2192 No body there \u2192 Safe (apple means I'll grow, tail won't move).\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 Empty \u2192 Safe.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,2) \u2192 Empty \u2192 Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Consider enemy snake's possible moves and collisions:\n\nEnemy snake head at (0,9), body: (1,9),(2,9),(2,8),(3,8),(3,9),(4,9),(5,9),(6,9).  \nPossible moves for enemy:  \n- UP (0,10) \u2192 off board \u2192 death \u2192 unlikely unless enemy suicides.  \n- DOWN (0,8) \u2192 empty \u2192 possible.  \n- LEFT (-1,9) \u2192 off board \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT (1,9) \u2192 its own body segment \u2192 death.  \n\nSo enemy's only safe move is DOWN to (0,8). That means enemy will likely move DOWN.\n\nGiven that, enemy head will be at (0,8) next turn, far from me. No direct head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Evaluate safe moves for future options and apple access:\n\n**DOWN (5,1):**  \n- Lands on apple \u2192 grow by 1, score +1.  \n- Next turn head at (5,1), body adds segment at old tail? Wait, growth means tail stays put this turn, so next turn body length increases.  \n- After moving down, my body will be: head at (5,1), then (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4) \u2192 tail at (7,4) still.  \n- From (5,1), possible next moves: UP back to (5,2) (occupied by my body), LEFT (4,1) empty, RIGHT (6,1) empty, DOWN (5,0) empty. So 3 safe moves next turn (UP is into body). Good.\n\n**LEFT (4,2):**  \n- No apple.  \n- Next turn head at (4,2), body: (4,2),(5,2),(5,3),(5,4),(6,4),(6,5),(7,5) \u2192 tail moves away from (7,4) because no growth.  \n- From (4,2), possible next moves: UP (4,3) empty, DOWN (4,1) empty, LEFT (3,2) empty, RIGHT back to (5,2) (my body) \u2192 3 safe moves. But farther from most apples.\n\n**RIGHT (6,2):**  \n- No apple.  \n- Next turn head at (6,2), body: (6,2),(5,2),(5,3),(5,4),(6,4),(6,5),(7,5) \u2192 tail gone from (7,4).  \n- From (6,2), possible moves: UP (6,3) empty, DOWN (6,1) empty, LEFT back to (5,2) body, RIGHT (7,2) empty \u2192 3 safe moves. Puts me closer to apple at (6,0) next turn.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Apple proximity:\n\nApples: (0,3) far, (9,9) far, (5,1) closest, (6,0) close, (0,1) far.  \nDOWN gets apple immediately. RIGHT sets up for (6,0) next turn (DOWN from (6,2) \u2192 (6,1) \u2192 then (6,0) if still there).  \nBut immediate apple gives me growth and score advantage.\n\n---\n\n### 5) Long-term plan note:\n\nEating apple now grows me longer, which could limit future mobility slightly, but with board still open, it\u2019s fine. Need to close apple gap with snake #0 (they have 8 apples vs my 6). Prioritize safe apple consumption while avoiding trap.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** DOWN gives immediate apple, safe, and keeps options open.\n\nDOWN",

Sticking to the wall is safer for harvesting the local apples.\n\nWe choose **DOWN**.\n\n### Enemy Movement Prediction (H1 at 5, 1):\n\nH1 just ate an apple and is now length 8. It is very close to A3 (6, 0).\nPossible safe moves for H1:\n*   UP (5, 2): Collision with neck. **DANGER**\n*   RIGHT (6, 1): Safe. (Proximity to A3 (6, 0))\n*   DOWN (5, 0): Safe.\n*   LEFT (4, 1): Safe.\n\nH1 is highly likely to try to move toward A3 (6, 0).\n1. H1 moves RIGHT to (6, 1). This puts H1 right next to A3.\n2. H1 moves DOWN to (5, 0) or RIGHT to (6, 1) and then DOWN to (6, 0) to capture A3.\n\nIf H1 moves RIGHT to (6, 1), our move DOWN to (0, 7) is completely safe. The snakes remain far apart (5 cells of separation minimum).\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (for T=26, 27, 28):\n\nThe current strategy of sweeping down the left column (X=0) to harvest A1 and A4 remains optimal, as it increases our lead while maintaining safety near the board edge, away from the enemy's operational area.\n\n1. **T=25:** Move DOWN to (0, 7). Head at (0, 7).\n2. **T=26:** Move DOWN to (0, 6).\n3. **T=27:** Move DOWN to (0, 5).\n4. **T=28:** Move DOWN to (0, 4).\n5. **T=29:** Move DOWN to (0, 3), capturing A1.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation.\n\n**Current Position:** My head is at (5,1). My body segments are: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4). Tail is at (7,4). I just ate the apple at (5,1), so I will grow. My new length is 8 (head + 7 body segments + 1 growth). This means my tail will stay at (7,4) for this turn.\n\n**Apples:** (0,3), (9,9), (6,0), (0,1), (9,1)\n**Enemy (#0):** Head at (0,8), body along top and down. Their only safe move last turn was DOWN to (0,8). From (0,8), their safe moves now are likely UP (back to 0,9 - its old body segment? Wait, check) or other directions. Let's check enemy's current body: Head (0,8), then (0,9), (1,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9), (4,9), (5,9). So from (0,8):\n- UP to (0,9): That's its own body segment \u2192 **Death**.\n- DOWN to (0,7): Empty \u2192 Safe.\n- LEFT: Off board \u2192 Death.\n- RIGHT to (1,8): Empty \u2192 Safe.\nSo enemy's safe moves are DOWN or RIGHT. They are far away, so collision risk is low this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Check my four moves for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (5,2): That's my own body segment \u2192 **DEATH**.\n- **DOWN** to (5,0): Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (4,1): Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (6,1): Empty. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Consider apple proximity and future mobility:\n\n**Apples:** \n- (6,0) is very close (two steps: DOWN then LEFT/RIGHT? Actually from (5,1), DOWN to (5,0), then RIGHT to (6,0)).\n- (0,1) and (0,3) are far left.\n- (9,1) and (9,9) are far right/top.\n\n**DOWN (5,0):**\n- No apple.\n- Next turn from (5,0): Possible moves UP (back to 5,1 - will be my body after growth?), LEFT (4,0), RIGHT (6,0 - apple!), DOWN off board. So UP might be blocked by my new body, but we need to simulate growth.\n\nLet's simulate growth after last turn: I was at head (5,1), body (5,2)...(7,4). I ate apple, so I grow. New body: head at (5,1) (new head position), then old head becomes body? Wait, the sequence: My head moved to (5,1) and ate. My old head was at (5,2). So new body: (5,2) (old head), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4), and tail stays at (7,4) because of growth. So my body now is: [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4)] with head at (5,1). So (5,1) is head, (5,2) is body.\n\nThus, if I move DOWN to (5,0), my new body next turn will be: head at (5,0), then (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5) and tail at (7,4)? No, growth means tail didn't move, so body length is now 8 segments? Let's be precise: Before move, length = 8 (head + 7 body). After moving DOWN (no apple), tail moves. So new body: head (5,0), then (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5). Tail at (7,5)? Actually, the last segment (old tail at 7,4) is removed, and the segment before it (7,5) becomes new tail. So body: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5). So from (5,0) next turn, UP to (5,1) is my body \u2192 blocked. LEFT (4,0) free, RIGHT (6,0) has apple, DOWN off board. So only LEFT and RIGHT are safe next turn from (5,0). That's okay but limits options.\n\n**LEFT (4,1):**\n- No apple.\n- Next turn from (4,1): body will be head at (4,1), then (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5). Possible moves: UP (4,2) free, DOWN (4,0) free, LEFT (3,1) free, RIGHT (5,1) my body \u2192 blocked. So 3 safe moves. Puts me closer to left-side apples but they are far.\n\n**RIGHT (6,1):**\n- No apple.\n- Next turn from (6,1): body will be head at (6,1), then (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5). Possible moves: UP (6,2) free, DOWN (6,0) apple!, LEFT (5,1) my body \u2192 blocked, RIGHT (7,1) free. So 3 safe moves, and DOWN next turn leads to apple at (6,0).\n\n---\n\n### 3) Strategic note:\nI need to catch up in apples (7 vs enemy's 8). The apple at (6,0) is highly valuable and reachable. Moving RIGHT now sets up a direct path to it next turn (DOWN from (6,1) to (6,0)). Moving DOWN now also allows eventual access but requires an extra turn. RIGHT seems more efficient for apple gathering.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT keeps me more central and avoids the left edge, which could be limiting. My body forms a barrier on my left (column 5, rows 1-4), so moving LEFT might eventually trap me.\n\nGiven enemy is far away and not an immediate threat, prioritizing the quickest safe path to an apple is best.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Secure the apple at (6,0) next. Then assess board. Avoid getting boxed in by my own body near the left wall. Keep an eye on enemy's position; they are currently in the top-left.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** RIGHT sets up for apple at (6,0) next turn while keeping good mobility.\n\nRIGHT",

(We just came from (0, 7)).\n2.  **DOWN (to 0, 5):** Empty space. Safe. Path leads toward A1 (0, 3).\n3.  **LEFT (to -1, 6):** Off board. **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 1, 6):** Empty space. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n### Move Selection:\n\nWe are continuing the simple, direct, safe path along the wall toward A1 (0, 3) and A4 (0, 1). The current score is 8 vs 7, so maintaining the lead and growing is paramount.\n\n*   **DOWN (to 0, 5):** Advances one step closer to A1. Maintains safety along the periphery.\n*   **RIGHT (to 1, 6):** Moves away from the primary targets.\n\nWe choose **DOWN**.\n\n### Enemy Movement Prediction (H1 at 7, 1):\n\nH1 is at (7, 1). Its neck is (6, 1). Apples visible nearby are A3 (6, 0) and A5 (9, 1).\n\nLast turn, we predicted H1 would move DOWN to (6, 0). H1 actually moved from (6, 1) to (7, 1) (RIGHT). This suggests that A3 (6, 0) might be less attractive or H1 might be prioritizing space/wall moves.\n\nPossible safe moves for H1:\n*   UP (7, 2): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (8, 1): Safe. (Toward A5)\n*   DOWN (7, 0): Safe. (One step from A3)\n*   LEFT (6, 1): Collision with neck (6, 1). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\nH1 is likely moving toward A5 (9, 1) or consolidating space near the bottom right.\nIf H1 moves to (8, 1) for A5: it gets closer to A5.\nIf H1 moves to (7, 0) for A3: it gets closer to A3.\n\nRegardless of H1's move, its position in the bottom right corner poses no immediate threat to H0 on the left wall.\n\nOur selection of **DOWN** remains robust.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (for T=28, 29, 30):\n\nContinue moving DOWN on the X=0 column toward A1 (0, 3) and A4 (0, 1).\n\n1. **T=28:** Move DOWN to (0, 4).\n2. **T=29:** Move DOWN to (0, 3), capturing A1.\n3. **T=30:** Move DOWN to (0, 2).\n4. **T=31:** Move DOWN to (0, 1), capturing A4.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Looking at the board and rules, let's analyze the current state. My snake (ID 1) has head at (7,1). My body occupies: [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]. Enemy snake #0 head at (0,6), body extends.\n\nAvailable apples at: (0,3), (9,9), (6,0), (0,1), (9,1).\n\nLet's check each possible move from (7,1):\n\n- **UP** to (7,2): Check if safe. My body: (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5). (7,2) is not in my body. Enemy body: (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (3,9). (7,2) not there. On board? Yes. Also need to consider enemy head movement: enemy head at (0,6) could move UP to (0,7) (occupied by its own body), DOWN to (0,5), LEFT off board, RIGHT to (1,6). So enemy won't be at (7,2). So UP seems safe.\n\n- **DOWN** to (7,0): Check: My body doesn't include (7,0). Enemy body not there. On board? Yes. Apple at (6,0) nearby but not at (7,0). Safe? Possibly, but note enemy head could move DOWN to (0,5) or RIGHT to (1,6), not to (7,0). So DOWN safe.\n\n- **LEFT** to (6,1): That's my own body segment! That would kill me. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n- **RIGHT** to (8,1): Not in my body, not in enemy body, on board (8,1 is within 0-9). Enemy head far away. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow consider future options and apples:\n\n- **UP** to (7,2): From there, next moves? Possibly UP to (7,3) (open), DOWN back to (7,1) (occupied by my old head position? Actually after move, my head at (7,2), tail at (6,5) stays? Wait, movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves into previous segment's position, tail moves forward if no growth. Since I didn't eat an apple this turn, my tail will move from (6,5) to (6,4)? Actually body list: head moves to (7,2), then segment 1 (old head at (7,1)) becomes new segment 2 at (7,1)? Let's simulate: My body: [(6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (6,5)]. After moving UP without eating: new head at (7,2). New body: old head position (7,1) becomes new segment 1, then (6,1) becomes segment 2, (5,1) segment 3, (5,2) segment 4, (5,3) segment 5, (5,4) segment 6, (6,4) segment 7, and tail (6,5) disappears because no growth. So new body: [(7,1), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)]. So (7,2) head, body occupies those. From (7,2), possible moves: UP to (7,3) (free), DOWN to (7,1) (occupied by my new body), LEFT to (6,2) (free), RIGHT to (8,2) (free). So three safe moves next turn except DOWN. Good.\n\n- **DOWN** to (7,0): New head at (7,0). New body: (7,1) becomes segment 1, then (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4). Tail (6,5) gone. From (7,0), moves: UP to (7,1) occupied, DOWN off board, LEFT to (6,0) (apple there but check safety: (6,0) is not in my new body? New body: (7,1),(6,1),(5,1),(5,2),(5,3),(5,4),(6,4). (6,0) is free. But DOWN off board so invalid. RIGHT to (8,0) free. So only LEFT and RIGHT possible next turn? Actually UP is occupied by own body at (7,1). So only LEFT and RIGHT. That's limited. So DOWN leads to fewer options.\n\n- **RIGHT** to (8,1): New head at (8,1). New body: (7,1) segment1, (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4). Tail (6,5) gone. From (8,1), moves: UP to (8,2) free, DOWN to (8,0) free, LEFT to (7,1) occupied, RIGHT to (9,1) (apple at (9,1) but also check enemy? enemy far). So three safe moves except LEFT.\n\nNow consider apples: Apples at (0,3), (9,9), (6,0), (0,1), (9,1). Closest to me: (9,1) is at (9,1) \u2013 moving RIGHT twice would get me there? From (7,1) to (8,1) then (9,1). But (9,1) is apple. However, need to check safety: moving RIGHT to (8,1) is safe now. Next turn if I go RIGHT again to (9,1), is that safe? At that time, my body will have moved: after first RIGHT, body as above. At turn 28, head at (8,1), body: (7,1),(6,1),(5,1),(5,2),(5,3),(5,4),(6,4). Moving RIGHT to (9,1): that cell not in my body, not off board. But enemy? Enemy head at (0,6) could move anywhere. Unlikely to reach (9,1) in one move. So possible. But also apple at (6,0) is closer? From (7,1), DOWN to (7,0) then LEFT to (6,0) gets apple. But DOWN limits future options.\n\nAlso consider enemy: enemy has 8 apples, I have 7. Enemy is long and wrapped on top row. It might be going for apples at (0,3) or (0,1). But enemy head at (0,6), moving DOWN to (0,5) then (0,4) etc could get to (0,3). But (0,1) apple is near my body? My body at (5,1),(6,1) etc. Enemy far.\n\nLong-term: I want to collect apples safely and avoid dead ends. Moving UP opens more space in the upper area. Moving RIGHT gets me toward apple at (9,1). Moving DOWN is risky because it reduces options.\n\nGiven that, UP seems best for maintaining mobility. Also, from (7,2), I can go UP further to (7,3) etc, or left to (6,2) which is open space. Right now board has many open cells.\n\nPlan for next few turns: Move UP to open area, then consider going towards apple at (9,9) or (0,3) depending on enemy movement. Avoid getting trapped in corners.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nUP chosen because it keeps maximum future options open (3 safe moves next turn) and moves away from my body cluster. DOWN limits options to only two moves next turn. RIGHT is also good but UP is slightly better for accessing central area. Will aim to collect apples safely while monitoring enemy.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

If H1 moves **LEFT** (to 6, 2), it gets closer to A3 (6, 0), which is two vertical units down.\n3. If H1 moves **RIGHT** (to 8, 2), it pivots toward A5 (9, 1), three moves away.\n\nGiven the proximity of A3 (6, 0), H1 might prioritize moving LEFT (6, 2) or UP (7, 3) to give itself space to maneuver down.\n\nRegardless of H1's move, H0 remains safe on the left wall with no collision risk. We maintain our strategy.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (for T=29, 30, 31):\n\nContinue moving DOWN on the X=0 column.\n\n1. **T=29:** Move DOWN to (0, 3), capturing A1.\n2. **T=30:** Move DOWN to (0, 2).\n3. **T=31:** Move DOWN to (0, 1), capturing A4.\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n### Move Selection:\n\nMoving **DOWN** immediately captures A1 at (0, 3), increasing our length and score, and moving us closer to A4 (0, 1). This is the optimal move.\n\n### Enemy Movement Prediction (H1 at 8, 2):\n\nH1 is at (8, 2), neck at (7, 2).\nPossible safe moves for H1:\n*   UP (8, 3): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (9, 2): Safe.\n*   DOWN (8, 1): Leads directly to A5 (9, 1) or sets up for it. Safe.\n*   LEFT (7, 2): Collision with neck (7, 2). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\nH1 has three safe moves.\n1. H1 moves **RIGHT** (to 9, 2): H1 gets closer to A5 (9, 1), likely planning to cut down.\n2. H1 moves **DOWN** (to 8, 1): Pivots towards A5 (9, 1) or A3 (6, 0).\n3. H1 moves **UP** (to 8, 3): Moves away from immediate targets, perhaps towards A2 (9, 9).\n\nThe enemy is focused on the southeast corner targets (A3, A5). This poses no threat to H0 on the left wall.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (for T=30, 31, 32):\n\nContinue maximizing apple consumption on the X=0 column.\n\n1. **T=30:** Move DOWN to (0, 2) (from A1 capture).\n2. **T=31:** Move DOWN to (0, 1), capturing A4.\n3. **T=32:** Move RIGHT or continue exploration from (0, 0).\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "**Analysis of the current board:**\n\nMy snake (ID 1) is at head (8,2) with body extending left and up. Enemy snake #0 is at head (0,4) with a long vertical body along the left edge. There are apples at (0,3), (9,9), (6,0), (0,1), (9,1). Enemy has 8 apples, I have 7.\n\n**Immediate danger check for each direction from (8,2):**\n\n- **UP** to (8,3): Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (8,1): Contains an apple at (9,1)? Wait, (8,1) is adjacent to my body segment at (7,1) but is itself empty? Checking board: column 8, row 1 is shown as '.' (empty). However, my body list shows (7,1) and (6,1). So (8,1) is free. But moving DOWN would put my head at (8,1). That cell is empty. However, I must check if moving DOWN would cause a head-on collision with enemy #0. Enemy head at (0,4) is far away, so no.\n- **LEFT** to (7,2): That's my own body segment (the second segment). That would kill me.\n- **RIGHT** to (9,2): That's within board (0-9). Empty cell. Safe.\n\nSo LEFT is immediately fatal. UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe from immediate self-collision and board boundaries.\n\n**Enemy movement prediction:** Enemy #0 head at (0,4). Its possible moves: UP to (0,5) is its own body (0,5) -> fatal. DOWN to (0,3) is an apple. LEFT is off board (x=-1) -> fatal. RIGHT to (1,4) is empty. So enemy's only safe move is DOWN to (0,3) (apple) or RIGHT to (1,4). It might go for the apple at (0,3) since it's adjacent. But moving DOWN to (0,3) would eat apple and grow. That's likely.\n\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (0,3), it will eat apple, grow, and its tail will stay at (2,8) (since eating adds length). Its new head will be at (0,3). That doesn't threaten me directly this turn.\n\n**Apple proximity:** Closest apples to me: (9,1) is at distance Manhattan 8 from (8,2)? Actually (9,1) is 1 right, 1 down = 2 steps away. (6,0) is 2 left, 2 down = 4 steps. (0,3) far. (9,9) far. (0,1) far.\n\n**Future mobility:** Let's evaluate safe moves:\n\n- **UP to (8,3)**: Next turn from (8,3): Possible moves: UP to (8,4) empty, LEFT to (7,3) empty, RIGHT to (9,3) empty. DOWN to (8,2) is my previous head position but will be empty next turn? Actually after I move UP, my body will shift: head to (8,3), second segment becomes (8,2), tail (5,4) disappears. So (8,2) will be empty next turn. So from (8,3) all four directions might be safe (depending on enemy). Good mobility.\n\n- **DOWN to (8,1)**: From (8,1): UP to (8,2) will be empty (my old head), LEFT to (7,1) is my body (will be there next turn? Let's see: after moving DOWN, my body: head (8,1), then (8,2), (7,2), (7,1), (6,1)... So (7,1) remains a body segment. So LEFT to (7,1) is fatal. RIGHT to (9,1) is apple. DOWN to (8,0) empty. So from (8,1) only UP, RIGHT, DOWN are safe? Actually LEFT is blocked by own body. Mobility reduced.\n\n- **RIGHT to (9,2)**: From (9,2): UP to (9,3) empty, DOWN to (9,1) apple, LEFT to (8,2) empty (old head), RIGHT off board fatal. So three directions safe.\n\n**Risk of head-on collision:** Enemy could move RIGHT to (1,4). That's far. No risk.\n\n**Strategic considerations:** I'm trailing by 1 apple. Need to catch up. The apple at (9,1) is very close if I move DOWN then RIGHT? Actually from (8,2), moving DOWN to (8,1) then RIGHT to (9,1) would eat it next turn. But moving RIGHT to (9,2) then DOWN to (9,1) also eats it next turn. Both sequences get apple in 2 turns? Wait: If I move RIGHT to (9,2) this turn, next turn I can move DOWN to (9,1) and eat apple. That's 2 turns total. If I move DOWN to (8,1) this turn, next turn I can move RIGHT to (9,1) and eat apple. Also 2 turns. So same.\n\nBut moving DOWN to (8,1) puts me closer to other apples like (6,0) maybe later. However, moving DOWN reduces mobility because left is blocked by own body. Moving UP keeps more options open.\n\nAlso, enemy might eat apple at (0,3) and grow, increasing its lead. I need to eat apples quickly.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Secure nearby apples while maintaining mobility. The apple at (9,1) is priority. After eating it, consider moving toward center to access more apples. Avoid getting trapped along edges. Keep an eye on enemy's long body along left wall\u2014it may eventually run out of space.\n\n**Decision:** UP seems safest regarding future options. DOWN also safe but limits left movement. RIGHT also fine. But UP gives me more freedom next turn. However, UP moves away from the closest apple (9,1). But I can go UP now, then next turn go LEFT/DOWN to approach apple? Actually from (8,3) I can go DOWN to (8,2) then RIGHT to (9,2) then DOWN to (9,1)\u2014takes longer.\n\nGiven I need apples, maybe go RIGHT to (9,2) to set up for DOWN to (9,1) next turn. That seems direct.\n\nCheck safety of RIGHT: cell (9,2) empty, no enemy collision risk. Good.\n\n**Final choice:** RIGHT.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (9,2), move DOWN to (9,1) to eat apple unless something changes. Then consider moving leftward along bottom row to (6,0) apple or upward.\n\nRIGHT",

Actually after eating, the tail doesn't move this turn, so my body becomes: head (9,1), then (9,2), (8,2), (7,2), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) \u2013 length 9.\n- Next turn from (9,1): UP to (9,2) is my body (fatal), LEFT to (8,1) empty, DOWN to (9,0) empty, RIGHT off board fatal. So only LEFT and DOWN would be safe. That's very restrictive and could trap me along bottom-right edge.\n\nIf I move **UP to (9,3)**:\n- My new head: (9,3). Body shifts: (9,2) becomes second segment, tail (5,3) disappears.\n- Next turn from (9,3): UP to (9,4) empty, DOWN to (9,2) my body (fatal), LEFT to (8,3) empty, RIGHT off board fatal. So UP and LEFT are safe. Better mobility than DOWN option, and keeps me away from immediate dead-end.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**  \nI'm trailing by 1 apple. While eating the apple at (9,1) now would tie the apple count, it severely limits my next moves and could get me stuck. The enemy is long and may eventually face space issues on the left wall. My priority should be to stay alive, maintain mobility, and position to collect multiple apples. Moving UP opens the board and lets me later target apples like (6,7) or (9,9). Moving DOWN risks getting pinned.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (9,3), consider moving LEFT toward center to improve access to apples (6,7) and (6,0). Monitor enemy's movement along left wall. Avoid getting trapped in corners. If enemy moves toward (0,1) apple, it may temporarily be away from top-left apples.\n\n**Final choice:** **UP** (maintains mobility and avoids potential trap).\n\nUP",

Best immediate move.\n2. **RIGHT (to 1, 2):** Moves away from the apple and potentially gives the enemy time to intercept other apples.\n\nThe optimal move is to continue moving **DOWN** to secure A3.\n\n### Enemy Movement Prediction (H1 at 9, 3):\n\nH1 is at (9, 3), neck at (9, 2).\nPossible safe moves for H1:\n*   UP (9, 4): Safe, moves towards A1 (9, 9).\n*   RIGHT (10, 3): Off board. **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n*   DOWN (9, 2): Collision with neck (9, 2). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n*   LEFT (8, 3): Safe.\n\nH1 must move UP or LEFT.

Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (9,2): My own body (second segment). **FATAL**.\n- **LEFT** to (8,3): Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: Off board (x=10). **FATAL**.\n\nSo only **UP** and **LEFT** are immediately safe.\n\n**Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy head at (0,2). Its possible moves:  \n- UP to (0,3): its own body \u2192 fatal.  \n- DOWN to (0,1): contains an apple \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT: off board \u2192 fatal.  \n- RIGHT to (1,2): empty \u2192 safe.  \nSo enemy can go DOWN or RIGHT. No immediate head-on collision risk with me.\n\n**Apple proximity and future mobility:**\n\n- **UP to (9,4)**: Puts me closer to apple (9,9) (vertical distance 5). Next turn from (9,4): UP and LEFT likely safe, but staying along right wall may limit future options.\n- **LEFT to (8,3)**: Moves me toward board center, closer to apples (6,7) (distance 2 left, 4 up) and (6,0) (distance 2 left, 3 down).

Avoiding edges generally provides more future safe moves.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,3), consider moving UP or LEFT to target apples (6,7) or (6,0).

This is a safe pivot but inefficient compared to eating.\n\nThe optimal move is **DOWN**.\n\n### Enemy Movement Prediction (H1 at 8, 3):\n\nH1 is at (8, 3), neck at (9, 3).\nPossible safe moves for H1:\n*   UP (8, 4): Safe.\n*   DOWN (8, 2): Collision with body (8, 2). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n*   LEFT (7, 3): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (9, 3): Collision with neck (9, 3). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\nH1 must move UP or LEFT. If H1 moves UP to (8, 4), it positions itself well to reach A4 (6, 7) or threaten A1 (9, 9). If it moves LEFT to (7, 3), it moves away from A1. Given the density of apples in the right columns, UP is a probable strategic move.\nIf H1 moves to (8, 4) in T=32, the snake body remains mostly on the right side.\n\n### Collision Check (H0 vs H1):\n\nH0 moves to (0, 0). H1 moves to (8, 4) or (7, 3). No collision risk.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (for T=33, 34, 35):\n\nAfter collecting A5 (0, 0) by moving DOWN:\n1. **T=33:** Head will be at (0, 0). Move RIGHT to (1, 0), starting the traverse towards A2 (6, 0).\n2. **T=34:** Move RIGHT towards A2 (e.g., to (2, 0)).\n3. **T=35:** Continue moving RIGHT towards A2. H0 should reach A2 around T=37-38.\n\nDOWN",

Next turn from (8,4): UP, LEFT likely safe, but staying near right wall may limit options.  \n- **LEFT to (7,3)**: Moves toward board center, closer to apples (6,7) (distance 1 left, 4 up) and (6,0) (distance 1 left, 3 down). Next turn from (7,3): UP, DOWN, LEFT likely safe, offering more flexibility.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**  \nI trail by 3 apples (7 vs 10). Enemy may eat (0,0) soon, widening gap. Moving LEFT improves mobility and access to multiple apples, while moving UP keeps me near the right edge, which could become a trap. According to [github.com](https://github.com/JeremyHub/Snake-Algorithms), algorithms that avoid edges and keep the tail in sight tend to perform better. Moving LEFT positions me more centrally, preserving future safe moves.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (7,3), consider moving UP toward (6,7) or DOWN toward (6,0), depending on enemy movement. Monitor if enemy eats (0,0) and heads toward other apples. Stay central to maintain options.\n\nLEFT",

Moving RIGHT to (1, 0) is the first step in traversing the bottom edge towards A2.\n\nWe are forced to move **RIGHT**. This aligns perfectly with the pre-planned strategy.\n\n### Enemy Movement Prediction (H1 at 7, 3):\n\nH1 is at (7, 3), neck at (8, 3). Snake 1 is moving left and is currently 7 segments long.\nPossible safe moves for H1:\n*   UP (7, 4): Safe. Moves away from the bottom wall.\n*   DOWN (7, 2): Collision with body (7, 2). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n*   LEFT (6, 3): Safe. If it moves here, it is positioning itself to go towards A5 (6, 2) or A4 (6, 7).\n*   RIGHT (8, 3): Collision with neck (8, 3). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\nH1 must move UP or LEFT. Snake 1 is long enough and located in a position where it should prioritize eating. A5 (6, 2) is the closest apple. A move LEFT to (6, 3) and then DOWN to (6, 2) seems highly likely, or perhaps UP to (7, 4) to maintain distance from ID 0.\n\nIf H1 moves LEFT to (6, 3), it gets dangerously close to A2, which is our target. However, ID 0 is 6 steps away from A2, while H1 is 3 steps away (6, 3) -> (6, 2) [A5] is 1 step, or (6, 3) -> (6, 0) [A2] is 3 steps. H1 is more likely to go for A5 than A2.\n\nSince H0 only has one safe move (RIGHT), we must take it.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (for T=34, 35, 36):\n\nCurrent goal: A2 (6, 0).\n1. **T=34:** Head will be at (1, 0). Move RIGHT to (2, 0).\n2. **T=35:** Head will be at (2, 0). Move RIGHT to (3, 0).\n3. **T=36:** Head will be at (3, 0). Continue moving RIGHT towards A2 (6, 0).\n\nRIGHT",

According to [github.com](https://github.com/JeremyHub/Snake-Algorithms), staying central and keeping the tail in sight improves survival. Moving LEFT to (6,3) positions me centrally with many safe follow-ups.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,3), assess safety of DOWN to (6,2) to eat apple. If DOWN is blocked by enemy or my body, consider UP toward (6,7) or LEFT/RIGHT to maintain space. Monitor enemy movement toward column 6 apples.\n\nLEFT",

T0 (tail) used to be at (1, 9) but should be (2, 9) if the snake grew at T=33. Recalculating S0 body from Turn 33 Rationale: S0 body before T=33 move was [(0, 1) ... (1, 9), (2, 9)]. Since an apple *was* eaten at T=33, the tail didn't pop. The body is now [(0, 0), (0, 1), ..., (1, 9), (2, 9)].*\n\n*Correction based on the current body provided in the prompt (which reflects the actual board state after T=33):*\nMy snake (ID 0) Body: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9)] (Length 12).\n*Tail (T0) is at (1, 9). The space (2, 9) must have been the previous tail position (T=32 tail).*\n\n### Safety Evaluation for H0 at (1, 0):\n\nForbidden next moves for H0:\n*   Borders: None near (1, 0).\n*   Own body: (0, 0) [neck], (0, 1), ..., (1, 9).\n*   Enemy body (T1): (7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 2), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1).\n*   Enemy Head: H1 (6, 3).\n\n1.  **UP (to 1, 1):** Safe. Empty square.\n2.  **DOWN (to 1, -1):** Off board. **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n3.  **LEFT (to 0, 0):** Collision with neck (0, 0). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 2, 0):** Safe. Empty square.\n\nSafe moves: UP (1, 1) and RIGHT (2, 0).\n\n### Enemy Prediction (H1 at 6, 3):\n\nH1 is at (6, 3), neck at (7, 3).\nClosest accessible apples for S1: A5 at (6, 2) (1 move) or A4 at (6, 7) (4 moves). A2 at (6, 0) is 3 moves away. Given that A5 (6, 2) is immediately below, S1 is highly likely to move **DOWN** to (6, 2) to eat the apple.\n\n### Strategy:\n\nMy main objective is A2 at (6, 0).\n*   If I move **RIGHT** to (2, 0), I am continuing directly toward A2 (6, 0). This requires 4 more moves: (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0).\n*   If I move **UP** to (1, 1), I deviate from the most efficient path for A2.\n\nThe move RIGHT (to 2, 0) is safe for my snake regardless of S1\u2019s move, as S1 is likely moving DOWN to (6, 2) (or LEFT/UP, far from my position near (1, 0)). Even if S1 moves unpredictably towards the bottom edge, S0 has a clear path for 3 more turns before reaching (5, 0).\n\nThe optimal move is to proceed along the lowest row towards A2 at (6, 0).\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (for T=35, 36, 37):\n1. **T=35:** Head targets (3, 0). Move RIGHT.\n2. **T=36:** Head targets (4, 0). Move RIGHT.\n3. **T=37:** Head targets (5, 0). Move RIGHT.\n4. **T=38:** Head targets (6, 0) [A2]. Move RIGHT (to eat).\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy body: [(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9)].  \nApples: (9,9), (6,0), (9,1), (6,7), (6,2).  \n\n**Immediate danger check from (6,3):**  \n- **UP** to (6,4): Empty. Safe.  \n- **DOWN** to (6,2): Contains an apple, and my body is not there. Safe (eating apple does not cause self-collision).  \n- **LEFT** to (5,3): Empty. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT** to (7,3): My own body (second segment). **FATAL**.  \n\nSo **UP**, **DOWN**, and **LEFT** are immediately safe.\n\n**Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy head at (1,0). Last turn I predicted it would move RIGHT to (1,0) \u2014 that happened. Now from (1,0), possible moves:  \n- UP to (1,1): empty \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN to (1,-1): off board \u2192 fatal.  \n- LEFT to (0,0): its own body \u2192 fatal.  \n- RIGHT to (2,0): empty \u2192 safe.  \nEnemy has two safe moves: **UP** to (1,1) or **RIGHT** to (2,0).  \nIf enemy moves UP to (1,1), it heads toward apples (6,0) or (6,2) indirectly.  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (2,0), it also heads toward column 6 apples.  \nNo immediate head-on collision risk with me unless I move to (5,3) and enemy moves RIGHT to (2,0) \u2192 not same cell.\n\n**Apple proximity and future mobility:**  \n- **DOWN to (6,2)**: Eats apple immediately. From (6,2): UP back to (6,3) would be my body after growth? Wait: after eating, my body grows by 1 segment at the tail end, so my head moves to (6,2), body becomes [(6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (9,3), (9,2), (8,2), (7,2), (7,1)] \u2014 so (6,3) is now my neck. Possible moves from (6,2): UP to (6,3) is my neck \u2192 fatal. LEFT to (5,2) empty. RIGHT to (7,2) my body (7th segment) \u2192 fatal. DOWN to (6,1) empty. So after eating, only LEFT and DOWN remain safe. That\u2019s risky.  \n- **UP to (6,4)**: No apple. From (6,4): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all likely safe (enemy far). Good mobility.  \n- **LEFT to (5,3)**: No apple. From (5,3): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all likely safe. Good mobility.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**  \nI trail by 4 apples (7 vs 11). Eating an apple now would tie me at 8 vs 11, still behind. However, eating the apple at (6,2) leaves me with limited safe moves next turn (only LEFT or DOWN). That could trap me. According to [github.com](https://github.com/JeremyHub/Snake-Algorithms), keeping future options open is critical. Moving DOWN for immediate gain might sacrifice future safety.  \nMoving UP or LEFT keeps more options open and positions me to target other apples (6,7) or (9,9) later. Enemy is far and moving toward column 6 apples; I might want to avoid direct competition until I\u2019m longer.  \nAlso, from [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54273041/snake-segments-that-flow-rather-than-snap-to-the-snakes-head-position), smooth movement and avoiding tight corners helps survival. Moving DOWN into a corner of my own body after growth could be dangerous.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,3), avoid DOWN if it leads to limited mobility after eating. Prefer UP or LEFT to maintain central position and keep tail in sight. Next turn, reassess safety toward apples (6,7) or (9,9). Monitor enemy movement toward (6,0) and (6,2).\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP and LEFT both safe and keep good mobility. LEFT moves me away from the apple cluster but keeps options. UP moves me toward apple (6,7) and keeps all directions open. I choose UP to progress toward (6,7) while staying safe.\n\nUP",

If enemy moves RIGHT, it moves away from me. No immediate head-on collision risk with my possible moves.\n\n**Apple proximity and future mobility:**  \n- **UP to (6,5)**: No apple. From (6,5): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all likely safe (enemy far, my body not adjacent). Good mobility.  \n- **LEFT to (5,4)**: No apple. From (5,4): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all likely safe. Good mobility.  \n- **RIGHT to (7,4)**: No apple. From (7,4): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all likely safe. Good mobility.  \n\nAll three safe moves keep good future options. I need to consider which direction gets me closer to apples while avoiding traps.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**  \nI trail by 4 apples (7 vs 11). Eating apples quickly is important, but staying alive is paramount. The nearest apples are:  \n- (6,2) is below me, but moving DOWN is fatal (into my body). I cannot reach it directly this turn.  \n- (6,7) is above me; moving UP progresses toward it.  \n- (9,9) is far top-right; moving RIGHT then UP could approach it.  \n- (9,1) is far right-down; moving RIGHT then DOWN could approach it.  \n- (6,0) is far down-left; moving LEFT then DOWN could approach it.  \n\nEnemy is at (2,0) and likely heading toward (6,0) or (6,2). I should avoid direct competition until I\u2019m longer. Moving UP toward (6,7) seems safe and puts distance between me and enemy. Moving LEFT or RIGHT also safe but doesn\u2019t progress toward an apple as directly.\n\nFrom [github.com](https://github.com/JeremyHub/Snake-Algorithms), keeping the tail in sight and maintaining mobility is key. My tail is at (7,2). Moving UP keeps it visible and opens central space. Moving RIGHT moves toward my tail but not into it. Moving LEFT moves away from my tail but also away from most apples.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,5) if I move UP, I can next consider UP toward (6,6) closer to apple (6,7), or RIGHT toward (7,5) to eventually target (9,9). Monitor enemy movement; if enemy moves UP to (2,1), it\u2019s still far. Avoid getting boxed in by my own body.\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP seems the best balance: progresses toward apple (6,7), keeps all directions open next turn, and maintains distance from enemy.\n\nUP",

Empty square.\n\nSafe moves: UP (3, 1) and RIGHT (4, 0).\n\n### Enemy Prediction (H1 at 6, 5):\n\nH1's neck is at (6, 4).\nClosest accessible apples for S1: A4 at (6, 7) (2 moves away: UP, UP). A3 at (6, 2) is 3 moves away (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN), but S1 cannot move DOWN this turn into its neck (6, 4). S1 is heavily incentivized to move UP towards (6, 7).\n\nPossible safe moves for S1 (H1 at 6, 5):\n1. **UP (to 6, 6):** Safe. Best move toward A4 at (6, 7).\n2. **DOWN (to 6, 4):** Collision with neck (6, 4). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n3. **LEFT (to 5, 5):** Safe.\n4. **RIGHT (to 7, 5):** Safe.\n\nS1 most likely moves **UP** to (6, 6).\n\n### Strategy:\n\nMy goal is A2 at (6, 0). I am on a direct path and the enemy snake is far away at (6, 5) and moving vertically. The path is safe.\n\n1. If I move **RIGHT** to (4, 0), I continue along the shortest path to (6, 0).\n2. If I move **UP** to (3, 1), I deviate, adding unnecessary steps and potentially complicating movement near my large vertical body segments on X=0 and X=1/2.\n\nContinuing RIGHT is the optimal choice.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy\n\n1. **T=37:** Head targets (5, 0). Move RIGHT. (2 steps from apple)\n2. **T=38:** Head targets (6, 0) [A2]. Move RIGHT (to eat). (1 step from apple)\n3. **T=39:** Eat A2 at (6, 0). Move RIGHT (to eat).\n4. After eating (6, 0), I might turn UP to target A3 at (6, 2) or A4 at (6, 7), depending on S1's position. S1 is currently heading toward A4 (6, 7). A3 at (6, 2) is currently blocked by S1's body segments T1 at (6, 3) and (6, 4), but the tail segment T1 at (8, 2) is 7 segments back, meaning S1's tail will move far away soon. If S1 continues moving UP, (6, 2) will likely clear up for me.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy body: [(2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8)].  \nApples: (9,9), (6,0), (9,1), (6,7), (6,2).  \n\n**Immediate danger check from (6,5):**  \n- **UP** to (6,6): Empty. Safe.  \n- **DOWN** to (6,4): My own body (second segment). **FATAL**.  \n- **LEFT** to (5,5): Empty. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT** to (7,5): Empty. Safe.  \n\nSo **UP**, **LEFT**, and **RIGHT** are immediately safe.\n\n**Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy head at (3,0). Possible moves:  \n- UP to (3,1): empty \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN to (3,-1): off board \u2192 fatal.  \n- LEFT to (2,0): its own body \u2192 fatal.  \n- RIGHT to (4,0): empty \u2192 safe.  \nEnemy has two safe moves: **UP** to (3,1) or **RIGHT** to (4,0).  \nNo overlap with my possible destinations: (6,6), (5,5), (7,5). No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Apple proximity and future mobility:**  \n- **UP to (6,6)**: No apple, but puts me one step closer to apple (6,7). From (6,6), I can move UP to eat it next turn if safe. Future moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT likely safe (DOWN would be into my new body).  \n- **LEFT to (5,5)**: No apple. Moves away from most apples. From (5,5), future moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT safe (RIGHT into my body).  \n- **RIGHT to (7,5)**: No apple. Moves toward apples (9,9) and (9,1) but farther. From (7,5), future moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe (LEFT into my body).  \n\nAll three safe moves offer good future options, but UP directly progresses toward the nearest apple (6,7) and maintains central mobility.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**  \nI trail by 4 apples (7 vs 11). Eating quickly is crucial. Apple (6,7) is two steps up; moving UP now sets up a likely safe consumption next turn. Enemy is far and likely targeting bottom apples (6,0) or (6,2). Moving UP creates distance and may secure the top apple uncontested.  \n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nIf I move UP to (6,6), next turn prioritize eating apple (6,7) if safe (check enemy movement and potential head-on collision). After eating, consider moving right toward (9,9) or left to avoid boxing myself. Monitor enemy\u2019s position; if enemy moves toward bottom apples, I can focus on top-right apples.\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP balances apple proximity, safety, and future mobility best.\n\nUP",

No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Apple proximity and future mobility:**  \n- **UP to (6,7)**: Apple (6,7) is here! Eating it grows me to length 9, increases my apple count to 8 (still trailing enemy\u2019s 11), and places a new apple randomly. After eating, my new tail will be at (9,2) (since I grow at the head). From (6,7), future moves: UP to (6,8) (empty), LEFT to (5,7) (empty), RIGHT to (7,7) (empty). All three safe, excellent mobility.  \n- **LEFT to (5,6)**: No apple. Moves away from most apples. From (5,6), future moves: UP to (5,7) (empty), DOWN to (5,5) (empty), LEFT to (4,6) (empty). All three safe, but delays eating.  \n- **RIGHT to (7,6)**: No apple. Moves toward apples (9,9) and (9,1). From (7,6), future moves: UP to (7,7) (empty), DOWN to (7,5) (empty), RIGHT to (8,6) (empty). All three safe, but also delays eating.\n\nAll three safe moves offer good future options, but **UP** directly eats an apple now, closing the gap with the enemy and giving me immediate growth. Eating quickly is crucial while staying safe.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**  \nI trail by 4 apples (7 vs 11). Securing (6,7) now is optimal\u2014it\u2019s uncontested (enemy far away) and safe. After eating, I\u2019ll be at (6,7) with good mobility toward other apples (especially (9,9) and (9,1)). Enemy may target bottom apples (6,0) or (6,2), but those are risky for them due to their long body along the left wall. My priority should be to eat as many apples as possible while avoiding dead-ends.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nIf I eat (6,7) and move to (6,7), next turn I should:  \n1. Check immediate safety from (6,7). Likely safe moves: UP to (6,8), LEFT to (5,7), RIGHT to (7,7).  \n2. Prioritize moving toward the nearest remaining apple, likely (9,9) or (9,1). From (6,7), moving RIGHT toward column 9 seems promising.  \n3. Monitor enemy\u2019s position; if enemy moves toward bottom apples, I can focus on top-right apples uncontested. Avoid boxing myself into corners; keep multiple escape routes.\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP is the best move\u2014immediate apple consumption, safe, and maintains high mobility.\n\nUP",

Safe move, guaranteed apple.\n\nSafe moves: UP (5, 1) and RIGHT (6, 0).\n\n### Enemy Prediction (H1 at 6, 7):\n\nH1's neck is at (6, 6).\nClosest apples for S1: A5 (7, 6) (2 steps away), A4 (6, 2) (5 steps away).\nS1 is currently positioned vertically at X=6.\n\nPossible safe moves for S1 (H1 at 6, 7):\n1. **UP (to 6, 8):** Safe. Moving away from A5 (7, 6).\n2. **DOWN (to 6, 6):** Collision with neck (6, 6). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n3. **LEFT (to 5, 7):** Safe.\n4. **RIGHT (to 7, 7):** Safe. One step closer to A5 (7, 6), but still 2 steps total (7, 7) -> (7, 6) is not allowed due to turning restrictions if they move RIGHT. Wait, S1 can move RIGHT to (7, 7), then DOWN to (7, 6) or DOWN to (6, 6) then LEFT/RIGHT. To get to (7, 6), the shortest path is usually DOWN to (6, 6) and then RIGHT to (7, 6), but DOWN is blocked.\n\nS1's safe options are UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n*   If S1 moves UP to (6, 8), they are positioning themselves for A1 (9, 9) or A3 (9, 1).\n*   If S1 moves LEFT to (5, 7), they are moving towards the center/left.\n*   If S1 moves RIGHT to (7, 7), they are positioning for A5 (7, 6).\n\nIf S1 moves $\\rightarrow$ (7, 7), they are now at distance 1 from $A5$ (7, 6). This is the shortest path to an apple currently visible for S1. I predict S1 moves **RIGHT** to (7, 7).\n\n### Evaluating My Move: RIGHT (to 6, 0)\n\nMoving **RIGHT** to (6, 0) allows me to eat Apple A2.\n*   H0 moves to (6, 0).\n*   Snake grows to length 13.\n*   Apples score becomes 12.\n\nHead collision check:\n*   My target: (6, 0).\n*   S1's likely target: (7, 7).\n*   No collision risk.\n\nThis move is optimal as it secures an apple immediately.\n\n### Strategy Note:\n1. **T=39:** H0 will be at (6, 0), length 13, 12 apples. New apples are spawned randomly. Given the remaining visible apples: A4 (6, 2) and A3 (9, 1). The shortest path to A4 (6, 2) is 2 steps UP. S1 is likely heading towards A5 (7, 6) or A1 (9, 9). I should prioritize A4 (6, 2) by moving UP. This keeps me on the vertical axis X=6, which is good for intercepting S1 if they try to move down later, and also keeps me near my larger body mass.\n\nRIGHT",

Good mobility and apple proximity.\n\nAll three safe moves offer good future options, but **RIGHT** positions me to potentially eat (7,6) next turn while also moving toward top-right apples. **UP** also moves toward top apples but delays eating. Since I trail in apples (8 vs 11), I should prioritize moves that lead quickly to an apple while staying safe.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**  \nEnemy is far away in bottom-left.

Alternatively, moving UP then RIGHT later may take longer.  \nAlso note my long body along column 6 from y=3 to y=6; moving RIGHT opens space and avoids trapping myself in that column.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nIf I move RIGHT to (7,7):  \n1. Next turn check immediate safety from (7,7). Likely safe moves: DOWN to (7,6) (apple), UP to (7,8), RIGHT to (8,7).  \n2. Prioritize DOWN to eat apple (7,6) if safe (enemy not threatening).  \n3. After eating, aim for top-right apples (9,9) or (9,1) while keeping escape routes open. Monitor enemy movement; if enemy moves toward bottom apples, I can secure top apples uncontested. Avoid boxing myself into right wall prematurely.\n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT positions me best for quick apple consumption next turn while maintaining mobility and moving toward high-value areas.\n\nRIGHT",

Empty square.\n\nSafe moves: UP (6, 1) and RIGHT (7, 0).\n\n### Enemy Prediction (H1 at 7, 7):\n\nH1's neck is at (6, 7).\nClosest apples for S1: A3 (7, 6) (1 step away), A5 (5, 8) (3 steps away), A1 (9, 9) (4 steps away).\n\nS1 is highly likely to move towards A3 (7, 6).\n*   Move DOWN to (7, 6): Eats A3. Safe move.\n*   Other options: UP (7, 8), LEFT (6, 7). Moving LEFT hits its neck (6, 7). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\nS1 must move **DOWN** to (7, 6) to eat the apple.\n\n### Evaluating My Safe Moves:\n\nMy closest apples are A4 (6, 2) (2 steps away) and A3 (9, 1) (4 steps away).\n\n1. **UP (to 6, 1):**\n    *   Next turn, I will be one step closer to A4 (6, 2).\n    *   Safety vs S1: S1 moves to (7, 6), far away. No conflict.\n    *   *Follow-up:* I can move UP again to (6, 2) to eat A4. This seems optimal.\n\n2. **RIGHT (to 7, 0):**\n    *   Moving away from A4 (6, 2).\n    *   This positions me better for A3 (9, 1) but requires 3 more turns (7, 0) $\\rightarrow$ (8, 0) $\\rightarrow$ (9, 0) $\\rightarrow$ (9, 1).\n    *   If I go RIGHT, S1 might finish up high and come down the right side.\n    *   This is a less direct route to a visible apple.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving **UP** allows me to continue the vertical climb along X=6 to immediately claim the next apple at (6, 2). This path is clean and safe.\n\n### Strategy Note:\n1. **T=40:** Move UP to (6, 1).\n2. **T=41:** Move UP to (6, 2) to eat A4.\n3. Then assess new apple spawns and prioritize A3 (9, 1) or A5 (5, 8) depending on S1's movement. S1 is likely heading high up the board now (after eating A3).\n\nUP",

Enemy body: [(5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6)].  \nApples: (9,9), (9,1), (6,2), (7,6), (5,8).  \n\n**Immediate danger check from (7,7):**  \n- **UP** to (7,8): Empty. Safe.  \n- **DOWN** to (7,6): Apple present, no snake body. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** to (6,7): My own body (second segment). **FATAL**.  \n- **RIGHT** to (8,7): Empty. Safe.  \n\nSo **UP**, **DOWN**, and **RIGHT** are immediately safe.\n\n**Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy head at (6,0). Possible moves:  \n- UP to (6,1): Empty \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN to (6,-1): Off board \u2192 fatal.  \n- LEFT to (5,0): Its own body \u2192 fatal.  \n- RIGHT to (7,0): Empty \u2192 safe.  \nEnemy has two safe moves: **UP** to (6,1) or **RIGHT** to (7,0).  \nNo overlap with my possible destinations: (7,8), (7,6), (8,7). No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Apple proximity and future mobility:**  \n- **DOWN to (7,6)**: Apple present \u2192 eat immediately, grow by 1, score becomes 9. From (7,6), future moves: UP to (7,7) (empty after I move), DOWN to (7,5) (empty), LEFT to (6,6) (my body), RIGHT to (8,6) (empty). So two safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good mobility.  \n- **UP to (7,8)**: No apple. Moves toward top apples (9,9) and (5,8). From (7,8), future moves: UP to (7,9) (empty), LEFT to (6,8) (empty), RIGHT to (8,8) (empty). All three safe, good mobility toward top-right.  \n- **RIGHT to (8,7)**: No apple. Moves toward right side, closer to apples (9,9) and (9,1). From (8,7), future moves: UP to (8,8) (empty), DOWN to (8,6) (empty), RIGHT to (9,7) (empty). All three safe, good mobility.  \n\nAll three safe moves are viable. However, **DOWN** gives an immediate apple, increasing my score to 9 (enemy has 12). Since I trail, eating quickly is critical. Also, eating now grows my tail, which may block enemy later but also lengthens my body, slightly increasing future collision risk\u2014but the immediate gain outweighs that.  \n\n**Strategic considerations:**  \nEnemy is far away in bottom-left, likely targeting apple (6,2) or (9,1). Apple (7,6) is closest to me and uncontested. Eating it now puts me at 9 apples, narrowing the gap. After eating, I can plan a route toward top apples (9,9) or (5,8) while monitoring enemy movement.  \n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nIf I move DOWN and eat apple (7,6):  \n1. My new head will be at (7,6), body grows by 1 segment (tail stays at (9,3) one extra turn).  \n2. Next turn check immediate safety from (7,6). Likely safe moves: UP (back to (7,7)), DOWN to (7,5), RIGHT to (8,6). LEFT to (6,6) is my body \u2192 fatal.  \n3. Prioritize moves that keep me safe and advance toward remaining apples, especially (9,9) or (5,8). Avoid trapping myself against right wall or my own long body along column 6.  \n4. Monitor enemy: if enemy moves toward (6,2) or (9,1), I may aim for (5,8) or (9,9) accordingly.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nDOWN gives an immediate apple, increases score, and maintains good mobility.  \n\nDOWN",

H1 is potentially trapped unless it goes RIGHT or DOWN.\n    *   If H1 moves **RIGHT (to 8, 6):** Safe.\n    *   If H1 moves **DOWN (to 7, 5):** Safe.\n\nGiven the goal is to reach high-Y apples, **RIGHT (8, 6)** is likely, allowing it to navigate around the top of its current structure (7, 7) and then push upwards. DOWN would take it away from the high-Y apples.\n\nLet's assume S1 moves RIGHT to (8, 6).\n\n### Evaluating My Safe Moves:\n\nMy immediate goal is A3 (6, 2).\n\n1. **UP (to 6, 2):** **Eats Apple A3.**\n    *   Score: ID 0: 13, ID 1: 9.\n    *   Safety: Apple space is empty.

No immediate benefit.\n\n### Collision Check (H0 vs H1):\n*   H0 moves to (6, 2).\n*   H1 moves to (8, 6) (Predicted).\n\nNo head-on collision is remotely possible.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n1. **T=40 (Current):** Move UP to (6, 2) to collect A3.\n2. **T=41:** After eating, a new apple will spawn. I will be at (6, 2) with my neck at (6, 1). I must then decide between A2 (9, 1) and A5 (2, 2). S1 is likely working its way toward A1 (9, 9) or A4 (5, 8). I should assess S1's position and prioritize A5 (2, 2) if it is safe, as it's closer than A2 (9, 1), and then use the bottom path to approach A2.\n\nUP",

All three safe, good mobility toward top-right apples (9,9) and (5,8).  \n\n**Strategic considerations:**  \nEnemy is at 12 apples, I\u2019m at 9. Enemy is likely to eat apple (6,2) if it moves UP, widening the gap. I need to target the high-value apples (9,9) and (5,8) while staying safe.  \nMoving RIGHT to (8,6) gives better access to the top-right region and keeps more options open. Moving DOWN to (7,5) moves me toward bottom-left where enemy is and offers fewer future options.  \n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nIf I move RIGHT to (8,6):  \n1. Next turn from (8,6), safe moves likely UP to (8,7), DOWN to (8,5), RIGHT to (9,6).  \n2. Aim to approach apple (9,9) via a safe path: e.g., (8,6) \u2192 (8,7) \u2192 (8,8) \u2192 (9,8) \u2192 (9,9) or (8,6) \u2192 (9,6) \u2192 (9,7) \u2192 (9,8) \u2192 (9,9).  \n3. Monitor enemy: if enemy eats (6,2), it may next target (9,1) or (2,2). I\u2019ll focus on (9,9) and (5,8).  \n4. Avoid getting pinned against the right wall or my own body along column 6.  \n\nRIGHT",

(0,0) bottom-left, (9,9) top-right.\n*   **Boundary:** $0 \\le X, Y \\le 9$.\n\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head (H0): (6, 2). Length: 14 (13 body segments + head).\n    *   Neck: (6, 1).\n    *   Apples: 13.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   Head (H1): (8, 6). Length: 10? (The preceding rationale from Turn 40 indicates S1 gained an apple, bringing its score to 9 and length to 10. The current state shows 9 body segments which confirms length $1+9=10$).\n    *   Neck: (7, 6).\n    *   Apples: 9.\n\n*   **Apples Remaining (A):**\n    *   A1: (9, 9)\n    *   A2: (9, 1)\n    *   A3: (5, 8)\n    *   A4: (2, 2)\n    *   A5: (5, 4)\n\n(Note: The location of the apples changed slightly from the last rationale/move, which suggests I successfully ate the apple at (6, 2) and five new apples were spawned: (9, 9), (9, 1), (5, 8), (2, 2), (5, 4). The new apple count is 5, consistent with the initial setup).\n\n### Safety Evaluation for H0 at (6, 2):\n\nForbidden positions for ID 0:\n*   Borders: X<0, X>9, Y<0, Y>9.\n*   Own body (Neck is at (6, 1)): [(6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)].\n*   Enemy body (T1): [(7, 6), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3)].\n*   Enemy Head: H1 (8, 6).\n\n1.  **UP (to 6, 3):** Collision with Enemy body segment (6, 3). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 1):** Collision with neck (6, 1). **DANGER (Eliminate)**. (Moving backwards).\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 2):** Safe. Empty square. Closest apple is A4 (2, 2).\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 2):** Safe. Empty square.\n\nSafe moves: LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Enemy Prediction (H1 at 8, 6):\n\nH1's neck is at (7, 6).\nS1 is in a strong position high up on the board.\nClosest apples for S1: A3 (5, 8) (5 steps: L, U, U, L, U) or A1 (9, 9) (4 steps: U, R, U, U). A1 is closer.\n\nS1's forbidden moves:\n1.  **DOWN (to 8, 5):** Safe.\n2.  **LEFT (to 7, 6):** Collision with neck (7, 6). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n3.  **RIGHT (to 9, 6):** Safe. Moving closer to A1 (9, 9). Very likely move.\n4.  **UP (to 8, 7):** Safe. Also moving closer to A1 (9, 9) or A3 (5, 8).\n\nIf S1 prioritizes A1 (9, 9), it will likely move UP to (8, 7) or RIGHT to (9, 6). Both moves lead it towards the high-Y apples. Let's assume S1 moves **UP to (8, 7)**, keeping flexible for A1 or A3.\n\n### Evaluating My Safe Moves (H0 at 6, 2):\n\nMy options are LEFT (5, 2) and RIGHT (7, 2).\n\n*   **Target proximity:**\n    *   A4 (2, 2): 4 steps left.\n    *   A5 (5, 4): 3 steps (L, U, U).\n    *   A2 (9, 1): 4 steps (R, R, R, D).\n    *   A1 (9, 9): Very far.\n    *   A3 (5, 8): 7 steps.\n\nThe best immediate targets are A4 (2, 2) and A5 (5, 4).\n\n1.  **Move LEFT (to 5, 2):**\n    *   Next move options: UP (5, 3), DOWN (5, 1), LEFT (4, 2).\n    *   Allows a direct path to A4 (2, 2) by continuing LEFT (5, 2 $\\to$ 4, 2 $\\to$ 3, 2 $\\to$ A4).\n    *   The path to A5 (5, 4) is also open (U, U).\n    *   This path helps me consolidate the bottom-left area, which S1 is currently ignoring.\n\n2.  **Move RIGHT (to 7, 2):**\n    *   This is a less commit-intensive move, keeping open the option to go towards A2 (9, 1) or stay central.\n    *   The snake's body is very long and stretches across the bottom from X=0 to X=6. Moving RIGHT creates less space to maneuver and complicates access to A2 (9, 1). If I go RIGHT, the only way to A2 is R, R, R, D, which leads me close to the enemy body mass (8, 3).\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving LEFT towards A4 (2, 2) is the most beneficial and safest option. It captures an apple swiftly, avoids the enemy, and solidifies control over the lower half of the board.\n\n### Collision Check (H0 vs H1):\n*   H0 moves to (5, 2).\n*   H1 moves to (8, 7) (Predicted UP).\nNo collision risk.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n1. **T=41 (Current):** Move LEFT to (5, 2). Start moving towards A4 (2, 2).\n2. **T=42:** Move LEFT (4, 2).\n3. **T=43:** Move LEFT (3, 2).\n4. **T=44:** Move LEFT (2, 2) to eat A4.\n5. After eating A4, proceed UP towards A5 (5, 4) or assess the new apple locations. S1 is likely focusing on A1/A3, so I should focus on the remaining low-Y apples and try to maximize score separation.\n\nLEFT",

Safe.  \n- **DOWN** to (8,5): Empty. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** to (7,6): My own body (first segment after head). **FATAL**.  \n- **RIGHT** to (9,6): Empty. Safe.  \n\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy head at (6,2). Possible moves:  \n- UP to (6,3): Empty \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN to (6,1): Its own body \u2192 fatal.  \n- LEFT to (5,2): Empty \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT to (7,2): Empty \u2192 safe.  \nEnemy has three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nIf enemy goes UP to (6,3), it moves into a cell adjacent to my body segment at (6,3)? Wait, checking board: my body at (6,3) is my 7th segment. That is safe for enemy (it's not its own body).  \nNo immediate head-on collision risk: my possible destinations (8,7), (8,5), (9,6) don't overlap with enemy's possible destinations (6,3), (5,2), (7,2).\n\n**Apple proximity and future mobility:**  \n- **UP to (8,7)**: No apple. From (8,7), future moves: UP to (8,8) (empty), DOWN to (8,6) (will be empty after I move), LEFT to (7,7) (my body), RIGHT to (9,7) (empty). Two safe moves (UP, RIGHT).  \n- **DOWN to (8,5)**: No apple. From (8,5), future moves: UP to (8,6) (empty), DOWN to (8,4) (empty), LEFT to (7,5) (empty), RIGHT to (9,5) (empty). All four safe! Good mobility.  \n- **RIGHT to (9,6)**: No apple. From (9,6), future moves: UP to (9,7) (empty), DOWN to (9,5) (empty), LEFT to (8,6) (empty). Three safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n\n**Strategic considerations:**  \nEnemy has 13 apples, I have 9. Apples (9,9) and (5,8) are high-value targets. Moving UP (8,7) gets me closer to (9,9) but reduces future options (only two safe next moves). Moving DOWN (8,5) gives excellent mobility and keeps me central, but moves away from top-right apples. Moving RIGHT (9,6) also gives good mobility and positions me to go UP toward (9,9) next turn.  \n\nGiven my long-term plan from last turn to target (9,9), RIGHT to (9,6) seems consistent: it places me on the rightmost column, from which I can go UP to (9,7) next turn, then (9,8), then (9,9). However, being on the edge (x=9) reduces lateral escape options. DOWN to (8,5) offers more flexibility and keeps me away from the edge.  \n\nChecking apple (5,4) is also reachable from (8,5) via LEFT-DOWN path, but enemy is near that region.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT gives a direct path upward along the right wall toward (9,9). DOWN gives maximum safety and options. Since enemy is not an immediate threat and I need to catch up in apples, I'll prioritize progress toward (9,9). RIGHT is acceptable.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nIf I move RIGHT to (9,6):  \n1. Next turn from (9,6), safe moves likely UP to (9,7), DOWN to (9,5), LEFT to (8,6).  \n2. Aim to approach apple (9,9) via (9,6) \u2192 (9,7) \u2192 (9,8) \u2192 (9,9).  \n3. Monitor enemy: if enemy moves toward (5,4) or (2,2), I can continue toward (9,9).  \n4. Avoid getting trapped along right wall; if UP becomes blocked, consider going DOWN or LEFT to regain space.\n\nRIGHT",

(Moving backwards).\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### Enemy Prediction (H1 at 9, 6):\n\nH1's neck is at (8, 6). S1 is pursuing the high-Y apples, A1 (9, 9) is 3 steps away (U, U, U), and A3 (5, 8) is 5 steps away (L, U, U, L, U). A1 looks like the clear priority.\n\nS1's forbidden moves:\n1.  **DOWN (to 9, 5):** Safe.\n2.  **LEFT (to 8, 6):** Collision with neck (8, 6). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n3.  **RIGHT (to 10, 6):** Off board. X>9. **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n4.  **UP (to 9, 7):** Safe. Moves toward A1 (9, 9). Very likely move.\n\nS1's safe options: UP, DOWN. Given the current lead in the area and proximity to A1 (9, 9), S1 will almost certainly move **UP to (9, 7)**.\n\n### Evaluating My Safe Moves (H0 at 5, 2):\n\nMy strategic goal from the previous turn was to claim A4 (2, 2).\n\n*   **Target proximity from (5, 2):**\n    *   A4 (2, 2): 3 steps LEFT.\n    *   A5 (5, 4): 2 steps UP.\n    *   A2 (9, 1): 4 steps (D, R, R, R) or (R, R, R, D).\n\n**1. Move LEFT (to 4, 2):**\n*   This is the continuation of the plan to eat A4 (2, 2).\n*   Path to A4: (5, 2) $\\to$ (4, 2) $\\to$ (3, 2) $\\to$ (2, 2) (Eat).\n*   Risk: Minimal. S1 is nowhere near.\n*   Next safe move options from (4, 2): UP (4, 3), DOWN (4, 1), LEFT (3, 2). Still plenty of space.\n\n**2. Move UP (to 5, 3):**\n*   Diverts towards A5 (5, 4).\n*   Path to A5: (5, 2) $\\to$ (5, 3) $\\to$ (5, 4) (Eat).\n*   This apple is equally close (2 steps vs 3 steps for A4), but A4 is slightly safer as it moves H0 further away from the main body mass at X=6. Additionally, moving Up might block the tail or create pathing issues if I then need to go back left or down. Given my long body is concentrated at the bottom, moving left to clear the congestion at X=6 is preferable.\n\n**3. Move DOWN (to 5, 1):**\n*   Moves towards a less critical area, away from apples A4 and A5. This reverses progress toward the current targets. **Avoid.**\n\n**Comparison:**\nMoving LEFT to (4, 2) keeps the plan on track, targets a close apple (A4), and provides good maneuvering space for the next turn.\n\n### Collision Check (H0 vs H1):\n*   H0 moves to (4, 2).\n*   H1 moves to (9, 7) (Predicted UP).\nNo collision risk.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update:\n1. **T=42 (Current):** Move LEFT to (4, 2). Continue path to A4 (2, 2).\n2. **T=43:** Move LEFT (3, 2).\n3. **T=44:** Move LEFT (2, 2) to eat A4, increasing score to 14.\n4. After eating A4, pivot towards A5 (5, 4) if it's still available, or assess new apple spawns. S1 will likely get A1 (9, 9) soon. I must maximize score in the lower half of the board.\n\nLEFT",

From (9,7) next turn, safe moves will be UP and LEFT (since DOWN will be into neck, RIGHT off board). Limited but allows progress toward (9,9).\n- DOWN to (9,5): Gets closer to apple (9,1) (now 4 steps away). From (9,5) next turn, safe moves will be DOWN and LEFT (UP into neck, RIGHT off board). Similarly limited.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\nEnemy has 13 apples, I have 9. I need to catch up. Apple (9,9) is on my column and enemy is far. Going UP commits to the top-right corner but gives a clear path to (9,9) in two more moves. After eating (9,9), I can escape left via (8,9). Going DOWN leads to apple (9,1) but takes longer, and enemy might grab other apples in the meantime.\nGiven my previous plan to target (9,9), moving UP is consistent and efficient. The risk of being trapped at the corner after eating is manageable because I can exit left.\nI choose UP to continue toward (9,9).\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**\nIf I move UP to (9,7):\n1. Next turn from (9,7), safe moves likely UP to (9,8) and LEFT to (8,7).\n2. Aim to go UP again to (9,8) to get closer to (9,9).\n3. Monitor enemy: if enemy moves toward (2,2) or (5,4), I can still proceed.\n4. After reaching (9,9) and eating, plan to go LEFT to (8,9) to avoid being trapped.\n5. Also consider apple (5,8) as a secondary target after (9,9) by moving left from (8,9) or (8,7).\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 4, 2):** Collision with neck (4, 2). **DANGER (Eliminate)**. (Moving backwards).\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### Enemy Prediction (H1 at 9, 8):\n\nH1's neck is at (9, 7). S1 is clearly focused on A1 (9, 9).\n\nS1's forbidden moves:\n1.  **UP (to 9, 9):** **Target A1.** Safe. Very likely.\n2.  **DOWN (to 9, 7):** Collision with neck (9, 7). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 8):** Safe. Moves away from A1. Less likely unless pathfinding suggested it was safer.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 10, 8):** Off board. **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\nS1 Prediction: S1 will move **UP to (9, 9)** and eat the apple A1. S1's score will increase to 10.\n\n### Evaluating My Safe Moves (H0 at 3, 2):\n\nMy objective is A4 (2, 2), which is 1 step away.\n\n**1. Move LEFT (to 2, 2):**\n*   Eats A4. My score increases to 14.\n*   This is the best move to secure points and maintain pressure.\n\n**2.

Move DOWN (to 3, 1):**\n*   Moves away from A4. Avoid.\n\n**Decision:** The move LEFT is critical for scoring this turn.\n\n### Collision Check (H0 vs H1):\n*   H0 moves to (2, 2) (Eats A4).\n*   H1 moves to (9, 9) (Eats A1).\nNo collision risk.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update:\n1. **T=44 (Current):** Move LEFT to (2, 2) to consume A4 (My score: 14). Predict Snake 1 eats A1 (S1 score: 10).\n2. **T=45:** My head is at (2, 2). The next closest apple is A5 (5, 4). Pathfinding from (2, 2) to (5, 4) should be prioritized, possibly going UP/RIGHT through (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4) or similar open routes. Need to avoid moving into my own body, which will now include (3, 2) as the neck. Available moves around (2, 2) are UP (2, 3) and possibly DOWN (2, 1). RIGHT (3, 2) is safe.\n3. **T=46:** Execute path toward A5.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current board and my position:\n\n**Current situation:**  \nMy head is at (9,8). My body: [(9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (7,6), (7,7), (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4)].  \nEnemy snake #0 head at (3,2), body long.  \nApples: (9,9), (9,1), (5,8), (2,2), (5,4).  \nI have 9 apples, enemy has 13. Need to catch up.\n\n**Immediate danger check from (9,8):**  \n- UP to (9,9): Contains apple, not occupied by any snake body. Safe unless head-on collision.  \n- DOWN to (9,7): My own body (neck). FATAL.  \n- LEFT to (8,8): Empty. Safe.  \n- RIGHT to (10,8): Off board (x=10). FATAL.  \nSafe moves: UP, LEFT.\n\n**Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy head at (3,2). Possible moves:  \n- UP to (3,3): Empty.  \n- DOWN to (3,1): Empty.  \n- LEFT to (2,2): Contains apple at (2,2), but also empty cell (apple is not a snake body). That\u2019s safe for enemy.  \n- RIGHT to (4,2): Its own body (neck). FATAL.  \nSo enemy has three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (2,2), it will eat apple (2,2) and grow. That\u2019s likely because it\u2019s the closest apple to enemy.  \nMy possible destinations are (9,9) and (8,8). No overlap with enemy\u2019s possible destinations, so no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Apple proximity and future mobility:**  \n- UP to (9,9): Eat apple immediately. Then I grow, so my tail stays at (6,4). Next turn from (9,9), safe moves will be limited: UP off board, RIGHT off board, DOWN into my new body segment (the old head position becomes body after growth? Wait: after eating, my head moves to (9,9), my body extends by 1 segment at the tail end, so the segment at (6,4) remains tail, and the segment behind head (old head at (9,8)) becomes body. So from (9,9), DOWN to (9,8) would be my own body (fatal). LEFT to (8,9) is empty. So only LEFT is safe. That\u2019s a dead-end next turn \u2014 I\u2019d be forced LEFT to (8,9), then from there maybe DOWN/LEFT/etc. Risk of being trapped if enemy approaches.  \n- LEFT to (8,8): No apple. From (8,8), safe moves next turn: UP to (8,9) empty, LEFT to (7,8) empty, DOWN to (8,7) my body (fatal), RIGHT to (9,8) my body (fatal). So two safe moves: UP and LEFT. More options, but I delay eating apple (9,9) which is right there.\n\n**Strategic trade-off:**  \nIf I go UP and eat (9,9), I gain an apple (now 10 vs enemy 13 or 14 if enemy eats (2,2)), but next turn I have only one safe move (LEFT to (8,9)). That could lead to being trapped if enemy moves toward top-right.  \nIf I go LEFT to (8,8), I keep more options open, but enemy might eat (2,2) and possibly (5,4) or (5,8) later, widening gap. However, apple (9,9) remains for me to take later if I can maneuver back.\n\nGiven the enemy\u2019 longer body and distance from (9,9), it\u2019s unlikely enemy will reach (9,9) before I can loop back if I go LEFT now. But going LEFT means I don\u2019t eat this turn, enemy could eat (2,2) and maybe others while I\u2019m moving away from apples.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**  \nIf I go LEFT to (8,8):  \nNext turn from (8,8), I can go UP to (8,9) then possibly LEFT along top row toward apple (5,8). Or I can go LEFT to (7,8) then down toward (5,4). This keeps flexibility.  \nIf I go UP to (9,9) and eat:  \nNext turn forced LEFT to (8,9). Then from (8,9) I have UP off board, LEFT to (7,9) empty, DOWN to (8,8) empty? Wait, (8,8) will be empty unless I go back. Actually after moving to (8,9), my body will be: head (8,9), then (9,9), (9,8), (9,7), ... So from (8,9), DOWN to (8,8) is empty, LEFT to (7,9) empty, UP off board, RIGHT to (9,9) body. So two safe moves: DOWN and LEFT. That\u2019s okay. So not as trapped as I thought.\n\nActually, let's recalc: If I move UP to (9,9) and eat apple, my body becomes: head at (9,9), then old head (9,8) becomes body segment, then (9,7), (9,6), ... tail at (6,4). So from (9,9), possible moves:  \nUP (9,10) off board \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT (10,9) off board \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN (9,8) my body \u2192 fatal.  \nLEFT (8,9) empty \u2192 safe.  \nSo only LEFT is safe. That\u2019s correct.  \nThen after moving LEFT to (8,9), my body: head (8,9), body (9,9), (9,8), (9,7), ... tail (6,4). From (8,9):  \nUP (8,10) off board \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN (8,8) empty \u2192 safe.  \nLEFT (7,9) empty \u2192 safe.  \nRIGHT (9,9) body \u2192 fatal.  \nSo two safe moves: DOWN and LEFT. That\u2019s fine. So not completely trapped.\n\nGiven that, going UP to eat apple now gains an apple immediately and still allows escape leftwards. Enemy is far away, so low risk of being cut off.\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP to (9,9) to eat apple and grow, then plan to move LEFT next turn.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (9,9), move LEFT to (8,9). Then assess board for apple (5,8) or (5,4). Avoid moving into enemy\u2019s possible paths.\n\nUP",

Open space.\n2.  **DOWN (to 2, 1):** Safe. Open space.\n3.  **LEFT (to 1, 2):** Safe. Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 3, 2):** Collision with neck (3, 2). **DANGER (Eliminate)**. (Moving backwards).\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### Enemy Prediction (H1 at 9, 9):\n\nH1's neck is at (9, 8). S1 is in the top right corner and has no immediate apples nearby. S1 must move off the boundary (9, 9).\n\nS1's forbidden moves:\n1.  **UP (to 9, 10):** Off board. **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n2.  **DOWN (to 9, 8):** Collision with neck (9, 8). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 9):** Safe. The only logical expansion move. Very likely.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 10, 9):** Off board. **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\nS1 Prediction: S1 will move **LEFT to (8, 9)**.\n\n### Evaluating My Safe Moves (H0 at 2, 2):\n\nMy objective now is the set of apples in the center-right: A3 (5, 4) and A5 (5, 3). A4 (1, 5) is also reachable.\n\n**Pathfinding to A3 (5, 4) / A5 (5, 3):**\nThe fastest way to get into the center lane (x=5) is generally by moving UP and then RIGHT, or DOWN and then RIGHT, maximizing movement toward the target x-coordinate 5. Since my neck is at (3, 2), pushing past it means moving into column 3 or 4.\n\n1.  **Move UP (to 2, 3):**\n    *   This sets me up for a rightward movement next turn toward (3, 3) or (4, 3) and then onto the apples (5, 3) or (5, 4). This minimizes turning around my snake's tightly wound body.\n    *   Path: (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (5, 3) [Eats A5]. 4 steps to A5, 5 steps to A3.\n\n2.  **Move DOWN (to 2, 1):**\n    *   This brings me closer to my own body segments at (2, 0) and (1, 0).\n    *   Path: (2, 2) -> (2, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (5, 1). This route is less direct to (5, 4) or (5, 3).\n\n3.  **Move LEFT (to 1, 2):**\n    *   This moves me toward A4 (1, 5).\n    *   Path: (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 4) -> (1, 5) [Eats A4]. 3 steps to A4. This is the fastest nearby apple.\n\n**Comparison of Targets:**\n*   A4 (1, 5) is 3 steps away (via LEFT, UP, UP).\n*   A5 (5, 3) is 4 steps away (via UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, UP).\n*   A3 (5, 4) is 5 steps away.\n\nGiven the proximity of A4 (1, 5) and the safety of the path (it moves me away from my most dense body segments in the bottom right corner of my current coil), A4 is a great immediate target. Snatching this apple will increase my lead.\n\n**Decision for A4 (1, 5):**\nTo reach (1, 5) in 3 steps, the first move must be LEFT to (1, 2).\n\n### Collision Check (H0 vs H1):\n*   H0 moves to (1, 2).\n*   H1 moves to (8, 9).\nNo collision risk.\n\nThe best move is LEFT to pursue the nearest apple at (1, 5).\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update:\n1. **T=45 (Current):** Move **LEFT** to (1, 2). Target A4 (1, 5). S1 moves to (8, 9).\n2. **T=46:** Move UP to (1, 3).\n3. **T=47:** Move UP to (1, 4).\n4. **T=48:** Move UP to (1, 5) and eat A4. My length increases to 16. My score is 15.\n5. **T=49:** From (1, 5), transition to the center apples (5, 8), (5, 4), or (5, 3), likely by moving RIGHT or DOWN initially depending on which path is safest from (1, 5).\n\nLEFT",

This segment is still part of my body this turn. **DANGER (Eliminate)**. *Wait, let's recheck the body listing.*\n\n*My Body Segments from input:* [(2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1)].\n*The segment at (0, 2) was the tail during the last move (T=45 rationale calculated its position after eating the apple), but now the current input shows the tail is at (0, 1).*\n*Last segment listed: (0, 1). Therefore, (0, 2) is currently **unoccupied** by my snake's body.*\n\nLet's carefully verify the last move and tail position:\n*   T=45 Start Head: (2, 2). Body for T=45: [(3, 2), (4, 2), ..., (0, 1), (0, 2)]. Length 15.\n*   T=45 Move: LEFT to (1, 2). The apple was at (2, 2), so I ate it.\n*   New Head (T=46 start): (1, 2).\n*   New Body (T=46 start): The old neck (2, 2) plus the rest of the old body. Since I ate an apple, the tail segment (0, 2) is *retained* and becomes part of the body.\n*   However, the provided current body list for T=46 is: [(2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1)].\n*   The length of this list is 14 segments. My length is 15 (Head + 14 body segments).\n*   The last segment is (0, 1). The segment (0, 2) is **not** on the body list.\n\nCrucially, **the current board state confirms (0, 2) is NOT occupied by my snake (ID 0)**. The map shows:\n 2 . 0 T T T T T . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nAt (0, 2), there is a '.' (empty cell).\n\nSo, the space (0, 2) is SAFE.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 0, 2):** Safe. Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 2, 2):** Collision with neck (2, 2). **DANGER (Eliminate)** (Moving backwards).\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### Enemy Prediction (H1 at 8, 9):\n\nH1's neck is now at (9, 9). S1 is still constrained in the top right, but has successfully broken out of the very corner on the previous turn.\n\nS1's forbidden moves:\n1.  **UP (to 8, 10):** Off board. **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n2.  **DOWN (to 8, 8):** Safe. Sets up for diagonal movement in the top right.\n3.  **LEFT (to 7, 9):** Safe. Good open space move.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 9, 9):** Collision with neck (9, 9). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\nS1's Likely Moves: DOWN (to 8, 8) or LEFT (to 7, 9). Both move S1 into open space, away from the immediate concentration of our snake's body in the bottom half. S1 is likely heading towards A2 (5, 8).\n\n### Evaluating My Safe Moves (H0 at 1, 2):\n\nMy long-term plan was to continue toward A4 (1, 5).\n\n1.  **Move UP (to 1, 3):**\n    *   This continues the path toward A4 (1, 5).\n    *   A4 is two moves away (T=47: 1, 4; T=48: 1, 5 [Eat]). This trajectory is clean and fast.\n\n2.  **Move DOWN (to 1, 1):**\n    *   Takes me toward my tightly coiled body sections [(1, 0), (0, 0)] and away from the apple. Low utility.\n\n3.  **Move LEFT (to 0, 2):**\n    *   Moves me away from A4 (1, 5) and puts me on the far left wall, potentially trapping me against my own long column of body blocks (0, 0), (0, 1). Low utility.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe path UP is the best move as it directly pursues the closest apple A4 (1, 5) while keeping the snake safe and in open territory.\n\n### Collision Check (H0 vs H1):\n*   H0 moves to (1, 3).\n*   H1 moves to (8, 8) or (7, 9).\nNo collision risk.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update:\n1. **T=46 (Current):** Move **UP** to (1, 3). Target A4 (1, 5). S1 moves to (8, 8) or (7, 9).\n2. **T=47:** Move UP to (1, 4).\n3. **T=48:** Move UP to (1, 5) and eat A4. Score becomes 15, length 16.\n4. **T=49:** From (1, 5), assess the safety and path to the next closest central apple: A3 (5, 4), A5 (5, 3), or A2 (5, 8). The path will likely involve moving RIGHT to the x=5 column.\n\nUP",

However, it keeps me near the top edge, which could limit future mobility.\n\nApple (5,8) is at y=8, x=5. From (8,9), going DOWN to (8,8) gets me closer in y-coordinate (from 9 to 8) and sets me up to move left toward it. Apple (5,4) and (5,3) are further down; I can head that way later.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:**  \nMove DOWN now to (8,8). Next turn, assess: if LEFT to (7,8) is safe, take it to approach apple (5,8). Avoid moving into enemy's path\u2014enemy is far left/bottom. Keep an eye on enemy's progression toward apples (5,3)/(5,4). Prioritize staying alive and maintaining at least two safe moves each turn.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN\n\nDOWN",

(0, 0) is safe.\n*   Enemy body (T1): [(8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6)].\n*   Enemy Head: H1 (8, 8).\n\n1.  **UP (to 1, 4):** Safe. Open space, continues path to A4 (1, 5).\n2.  **DOWN (to 1, 2):** Collision with neck (1, 2). **DANGER (Eliminate)** (Moving backwards).\n3.  **LEFT (to 0, 3):** Safe. Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 2, 3):** Safe. Open space.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Enemy Prediction (H1 at 8, 8):\n\nH1's neck is at (8, 9). H1 is positioned to move toward the central-top apple A2 (5, 8).\n\nS1's forbidden moves:\n1.  **UP (to 8, 9):** Collision with neck. **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n2.  **DOWN (to 8, 7):** Safe. Open space.\n3.  **LEFT (to 7, 8):** Safe. Pursues A2 (5, 8), moves away from their long body segment.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 9, 8):** Collision with body segment (9, 8). **DANGER (Eliminate)** (9, 8 is part of the body: (9, 9), (9, 8)...).\n\nS1's likely safe moves: DOWN or LEFT. Moving LEFT to (7, 8) is a stronger path toward A2 (5, 8). Moving DOWN to (8, 7) is also possible but less direct for A2. **I assume H1 moves LEFT to (7, 8) or DOWN to (8, 7).**\n\n### Secondary Collision Check (H0 vs H1):\n*   H0 potential moves: (1, 4), (0, 3), (2, 3).\n*   H1 potential moves: (7, 8), (8, 7).\nNo immediate risk of head-on collision.\n\n### Evaluating My Safe Moves (H0 at 1, 3):\n\nMy objective is to secure A4 (1, 5) quickly.\n\n1.  **UP (to 1, 4):**\n    *   Direct path continuation. Next turn (T=48) I will move UP to (1, 5) and eat the apple. Highest utility.\n\n2.  **LEFT (to 0, 3):**\n    *   Moves away from A4. Low utility.\n\n3.  **RIGHT (to 2, 3):**\n    *   Moves away from A4. Low utility.\n\n**Decision:** The move UP is the clear choice to secure the target apple A4 in two moves.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update:\n1. **T=47 (Current):** Move **UP** to (1, 4). Target A4 (1, 5). S1 likely moves to (7, 8) or (8, 7).\n2. **T=48:** Move UP to (1, 5) and eat A4. Score becomes 15, length 16. The new apple spawn may shift the strategy.\n3. **T=49:** From (1, 5), assess the path to the next closest central apples: A3 (5, 4), A5 (5, 3). Given my current long body coiling in the bottom left, moving RIGHT to the x=5 column seems logical to get to those fruits and utilize the open space. S1 is likely far away in the top-right pursuing A2.\n\nUP",

That leaves only UP back to (8,8) as safe next turn \u2014 a dead-end! This would trap me with only one safe move next turn, which is risky.\n- **LEFT to (7,8):** Moves me left toward apple (5,8). From (7,8), next turn I could go DOWN to (7,7) (my body \u2192 fatal), LEFT to (6,8) (empty), UP to (7,9) (empty), RIGHT to (8,8) (empty). That gives three safe moves next turn (LEFT, UP, RIGHT), keeping options open.\n\nApple (5,8) is at y=8, x=5. Moving LEFT to (7,8) gets me closer in x-coordinate (from 8 to 7) and sets me up to continue left toward it. Apple (5,4) and (5,3) are lower; I can head down later after securing (5,8). Apple (9,1) is far bottom-right; I can consider it later.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:**  \nMove LEFT now to (7,8). Next turn, assess: if LEFT to (6,8) is safe, take it to continue toward apple (5,8). Avoid moving into my own body or the enemy's path. Keep an eye on enemy's progression toward apples (5,3)/(5,4). Prioritize staying alive and maintaining at least two safe moves each turn.\n\nLEFT",

I am one move away.\n\n### Safety Evaluation for H0 at (1, 4):\n\nSnake 0 Body (excluding Head at (1, 4)): [(1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0)].\n*Note: Since my previous move did not involve eating, my tail (1, 0) will shed this turn, making (1, 0) safe.*\n\n**Forbidden positions for ID 0 (before enemy movement):**\n*   Borders: None of the immediate adjacent squares are borders.\n*   Own body: [(1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0)]. (1, 0) is safe.\n*   Enemy body (T1): [(8, 8), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6)].\n*   Enemy Head: H1 (7, 8).\n\n1.  **UP (to 1, 5):** Apple A4 is here. **Safe.** (This results in growth).\n2.  **DOWN (to 1, 3):** Collision with neck (1, 3). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n3.  **LEFT (to 0, 4):** Safe. Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 2, 4):** Safe. Open space.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Enemy Prediction (H1 at 7, 8):\n\nH1's neck is at (8, 8). H1 is generally oriented toward the top-right corner. The immediate apple A2 (5, 8) is two steps to the left.\n\nS1's forbidden moves:\n1.  **UP (to 7, 9):** Safe. Keeps S1 centralized relative to A2 (5, 8).\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 7):** Collision with body segment (7, 7). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 8):** Safe. Direct path toward A2 (5, 8). Highest Utility.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 8):** Collision with neck (8, 8). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\nS1's likely safe moves: UP (to 7, 9) or LEFT (to 6, 8). S1 is most likely moving **LEFT** to *6, 8* to get to A2 at *5, 8*.\n\n### Secondary Collision Check (H0 vs H1):\n*   H0 potential moves: (1, 5), (0, 4), (2, 4).\n*   H1 potential moves: (7, 9), (6, 8).\nThere is no risk of collision between H0 and H1 this turn.\n\n### Evaluating My Safe Moves (H0 at 1, 4):\n\nThe move **UP to (1, 5)** results in eating A4 (1, 5), increasing my score to 15, and guaranteeing growth and future safety by creating space. This is the highest utility move.\n\nIf I move LEFT or RIGHT, I allow Snake 1 to continue closing the gap in apples, and I forfeit the target I spent the last few turns moving toward.\n\n**Decision:** Move UP and eat the apple.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update:\n1. **T=48 (Current):** Move **UP** to (1, 5) and eat A4. Score 15, Length 16 (tail will not shed). S1 likely moves LEFT to (6, 8) pursuing A2 (5, 8).\n2. **T=49:** From (1, 5), my body is very dense in the bottom-left corner. The next closest apples are A3 (5, 4) and A5 (5, 3). I need to move RIGHT to break out of the corner and head towards the central area. The path `(2, 5)` -> `(3, 5)` -> `(4, 5)` -> `(5, 5)` then DOWN to A3 or A5 seems appropriate.\n\nUP",

The game state shows a new apple at (9, 2) and (5, 8) is still A2. Apples were re-indexed for clarity only.*\n\nMy snake is currently in the far left lane. I just ate an apple, so my tail did not move from (1, 0) last turn, and my length is now 16.\n\n### Safety Evaluation for H0 at (1, 5):\n\nSnake 0 Body (excluding Head at (1, 5), ordered head-to-tail): [(1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0)].\n\n*Since I grew last turn, my tail (1, 0) **will not** shed this turn.*\n\n**Forbidden positions for ID 0 (before enemy movement):**\n*   Borders: None.\n*   Own body: [(1, 4)] is the neck. A move DOWN is suicidal. All other body segments are forbidden: [(1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0)].\n*   Enemy body (T1): T1 occupies (6, 7), (7, 6), (8, 6)... (See board map: the 'T' and '1' segments).\n*   Enemy Head: H1 (6, 8).\n\n1.  **UP (to 1, 6):** Safe. Open space.\n2.  **DOWN (to 1, 4):** Collision with neck (1, 4). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n3.  **LEFT (to 0, 5):** Safe. Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 2, 5):** Safe. Open space.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Enemy Prediction (H1 at 6, 8):\n\nH1 is at (6, 8), with its neck at (7, 8). Enemy 1 is likely pursuing A2 at (5, 8).\n\nS1's forbidden moves:\n1.  **UP (to 6, 9):** Safe. Open.\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 7):** Collision with body segment (6, 7). **DANGER (Eliminate)**. (S1 body includes (6, 7) based on the board map: a T is at (6, 7)).\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 8):** Apple A2 is here. **HIGH UTILITY**.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 8):** Collision with neck (7, 8). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\nS1's most rational move is **LEFT** to (5, 8) to eat the apple.\n\n### Secondary Collision Check (H0 vs H1):\n*   H0 potential moves: (1, 6), (0, 5), (2, 5).\n*   H1 potential moves: (6, 9), (5, 8).\nThere is no risk of collision between H0 and H1 this turn.\n\n### Evaluating My Safe Moves (H0 at 1, 5):\n\nMy primary goal is to move towards the next available apple. The closest available apples are A3 (5, 4) and A4 (5, 3), which are 4 steps away. A2 (5, 8) is 5 steps away, but Snake 1 is likely eating it this turn.\n\nI need to move **RIGHT** to shift my snake away from the dense column it is currently trapped in (column 1 is full of my body segments).\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (to 2, 5):** Directs me toward the center of the board and the cluster of apples at (5, 4) and (5, 3). This is the best strategic option.\n*   **Move UP (to 1, 6):** Moves me further into the top-left corner, away from the apples and closer to the border/Snake 1's general area.\n*   **Move LEFT (to 0, 5):** Traps me against the West wall. Bad move.\n\nThe move RIGHT to (2, 5) immediately opens up further options (e.g., continuing RIGHT towards column 5).\n\n**Decision:** Move RIGHT.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update:\n1. **T=49 (Current):** Move **RIGHT** to (2, 5). S1 likely moves LEFT to (5, 8) and eats A2. My score 15, Length 15 (tail sheds at 1, 0).\n2. **T=50:** From (2, 5), continue **RIGHT** to (3, 5), shifting further into open territory toward A3 (5, 4) / A4 (5, 3).\n3. **T=51:** Continue **RIGHT** to (4, 5).\n4. **T=52:** Move **DOWN** to (4, 4).\n5. **T=53:** Move **RIGHT** to (5, 4) and eat A3.\n\nThis path prioritizes movement and securing the next available central apple cluster before Snake 1 can pivot from the top-center.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current board, my head is at (6,8). My body occupies cells: [(7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (7,6), (7,7)]. Apples are at: (9,1), (5,8), (5,4), (5,3), (9,2). Enemy snake #0 head at (1,5), body long.\n\n**Immediate safety check for each possible move from (6,8):**\n\n- **UP to (6,9)**: Check board: row 9 column 6? Board shows at (9,6) is my body (T). But (6,9) is within bounds 0-9. Looking at board representation: row 9 (top row) shows \". . . . . . . . T T\" so column 6 (0-indexed) is the 7th char: positions 0-9: 0:'.',1:'.',2:'.',3:'.',4:'.',5:'.',6:'.',7:'.',8:'T',9:'T' -> column 6 is '.' (empty). Wait, careful: The board is drawn with Y from 9 at top to 0 at bottom. So row 9 is top row. The string \"9 . . . . . . . T T\" means columns 0-9: col0='.', col1='.', col2='.', col3='.', col4='.', col5='.', col6='.', col7='.', col8='T', col9='T'. So (6,9) is row 9, column 6 -> empty. Also check enemy body: enemy body list doesn't include (6,9). So UP is safe.\n\n- **DOWN to (6,7)**: Check board: row 7 column 6? Row 7: \"7 . . . . . . . T . T\" -> col6 is the 7th char: positions: 0:'.',1:'.',2:'.',3:'.',4:'.',5:'.',6:'.',7:'T',8:'.',9:'T' -> col6='.' empty. My body: (6,7) not in my body list. Enemy body: not there. Safe.\n\n- **LEFT to (5,8)**: Check board: row 8 column 5? Row 8: \"8 . . . . . A 1 T T T\" -> col5='A' (apple). So (5,8) is an apple. My body: not in my body. Enemy body: not there. However, need to check if enemy head could move into (5,8) this turn. Enemy head at (1,5). Possible moves: UP to (1,6), DOWN to (1,4) but that's its own neck? Actually enemy body: [(1,4), (1,3), ...] so DOWN to (1,4) is its own body \u2192 fatal. LEFT to (0,5), RIGHT to (2,5). So enemy cannot reach (5,8) in one move. So LEFT is safe and eats apple.\n\n- **RIGHT to (7,8)**: That's my own body (second segment). That would be moving into my own body \u2192 fatal. So not safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Now consider enemy head movement and potential head-on collisions:**\n\nEnemy head at (1,5). Its safe moves: UP to (1,6), LEFT to (0,5), RIGHT to (2,5). DOWN to (1,4) is its own body. So enemy cannot reach any of my candidate cells this turn. So no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Strategic evaluation:**\n\n- **LEFT to (5,8)**: Immediately eats apple, bringing my apple count to 11 vs enemy's 15. After eating, my snake will grow by 1 segment next turn (tail won't move). From (5,8), next turn my head will be at (5,8) and my body will include the old head position (6,8) as new segment. Then possible moves from (5,8): UP (5,9) empty, DOWN (5,7) empty, LEFT (4,8) empty, RIGHT (6,8) my body (since old head becomes body). So three safe moves except RIGHT. Good mobility. Also note apple at (5,4) and (5,3) are directly below along same column, could be a path.\n\n- **UP to (6,9)**: Empty cell. From there, next turn moves: UP off board (dead), DOWN (6,8) my body (since my neck is (7,8) but after moving UP, my body will be [(6,8), (7,8), ...] so (6,8) is my body), LEFT (5,9) empty, RIGHT (7,9) empty? Check board: row 9 col7 is 'T' (my body), so RIGHT into body. So only LEFT is safe. That's risky because only one safe move next turn.\n\n- **DOWN to (6,7)**: Empty cell. From there, next turn moves: UP back to (6,8) my body? After moving DOWN, my body will be [(6,7), (6,8), (7,8), ...] so (6,8) is my body. DOWN to (6,6) empty, LEFT to (5,7) empty, RIGHT to (7,7) my body (since (7,7) is in my body list). So DOWN and LEFT are safe. That's two safe moves. However, no immediate apple nearby.\n\nComparing: LEFT gives apple and good future options. UP is risky (only one safe follow-up). DOWN is safe but doesn't progress toward apple.\n\nAlso consider long-term: Enemy has 15 apples, I have 10. Need to catch up. Eating apples quickly is important, but must avoid dead ends. After eating apple at (5,8), I could go DOWN toward (5,4) and (5,3). However, note that enemy is far away on left side, so I have time.\n\nCheck board for potential traps: My current body forms a sort of C-shape on right side. Moving LEFT away from my body cluster opens space.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move LEFT to (5,8) and eat apple. Next turn, assess from (5,8): likely move DOWN to (5,7) to start descending toward lower apples while keeping options open (LEFT/UP/DOWN). Avoid moving RIGHT back into my body. Also consider that enemy may try to cut me off, but enemy is far.\n\n**Final move:** LEFT\n\nLEFT",

Length: 16 (Did not grow last turn, as length remains 16).\n    *   Neck: (1, 5).\n    *   Apples collected: 15.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   Head (H1): (5, 8). Length: 12 (Must have eaten an apple, score 11 suggests one was eaten somewhere).\n    *   Neck: (6, 8).\n    *   Apples collected: 11.\n*   **Apples Remaining (A):** (9, 1), (5, 4), (5, 3), (9, 2), (4, 4). (Total 5 apples).\n\n**Observation:** My prediction that Snake 1 would eat an apple was correct (score changed from 10 to 11, and the apple at (5, 8) is gone). My own move was RIGHT to (2, 5).\n\n### My Snake (ID 0) Movement Details:\nH0 is at (2, 5). The snake is 16 segments long.\nBody segments (ordered head-to-tail): [(1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0)].\nSince I did not eat an apple, my tail segment, (2, 0), will be shed this turn, opening up (2, 0) for movement.\n\n**Forbidden positions for ID 0 (before enemy movement):**\n1.  **Borders:** None.\n2.  **Own body:** Forbidden: [(1, 5) - Neck, (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0)]. Safe: (2, 0) (tail sheds).\n3.  **Enemy body (T1):** T1 occupies [(6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7)] (Length 12).\n4.  **Enemy Head:** H1 (5, 8).\n\n### Safety Evaluation for H0 at (2, 5):\n\n1.  **UP (to 2, 6):** Safe. Open space.\n2.  **DOWN (to 2, 4):** Safe. Open space.\n3.  **LEFT (to 1, 5):** Collision with neck (1, 5). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 3, 5):** Safe. Open space.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n### Enemy Prediction (H1 at 5, 8):\nH1 is at (5, 8). It just ate an apple, so its tail (7, 7) will **not** shed this turn.\n\nNearby Apples: The cluster (5, 4), (5, 3), (4, 4). These are 4-5 moves away, a bit far for immediate pursuit by Snake 1, but manageable.\n\nS1's forbidden positions:\n1.  **Borders:** None.\n2.  **Own Body:** Neck (6, 8) and body segments.\n3.  **My Body:** None nearby.\n4.  **My Head:** H0 at (2, 5).\n\nPossible moves for S1:\n1.  **UP (to 5, 9):** Safe. Keeps S1 in the top row.\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 7):** Safe. This move pivots S1 towards the central apples (5, 4), (5, 3).\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 8):** Safe. Moves S1 towards the center-top.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 8):** Collision with neck. **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\nS1's most rational move is either **DOWN** to (5, 7) to start approaching the remaining large apple cluster, or **LEFT** to gain maneuverability. We will assume S1 prioritizes approaching the next nearest food.\n\n### Secondary Collision Check (H0 vs H1):\n*   H0 potential moves: (2, 6), (2, 4), (3, 5).\n*   H1 potential moves: (5, 9), (5, 7), (4, 8).\nNo head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n### Evaluating My Safe Moves (H0 at 2, 5):\n\nThe closest apples are:\n1.  (4, 4) - 2 steps (Right, Down).\n2.  (5, 4) - 3 steps (Right, Right, Down).\n3.  (5, 3) - 3 steps (Right, Right, Down).\n\nMy current position (2, 5) gives me great central control and is 3 squares away from the central apple action.\n\nThe long-term plan from the last turn was:\n1. **T=50 (Current):** Move **RIGHT** to (3, 5). (This is now the current turn).\n2. **T=51:** Continue **RIGHT** to (4, 5).\n3. **T=52:** Move **DOWN** to (4, 4). (Eat apple).\n4. **T=53:** Move **RIGHT** to (5, 4) and eat A3.\n\nThis path is still optimal as it leads directly to the nearest, relatively uncontested apple cluster. An immediate move DOWN to (2, 4) or UP to (2, 6) is useful for flexibility but delays reaching the target apples. Moving RIGHT progresses the plan.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 5):\n*   Next turn, I am at (3, 5). Snake 1 will likely be at (5, 7) or (4, 8).\n*   From (3, 5), I have a clear path (3, 5) -> (4, 5) -> (4, 4 [Apple]) in two steps.\n\nThis seems like the best approach to maximize apple collection while controlling the center.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update:\n1. **T=50 (Current):** Move **RIGHT** to (3, 5). Progress toward the center apples (4, 4) and (5, 4).\n2. **T=51:** Move **RIGHT** to (4, 5).\n3. **T=52:** Move **DOWN** to (4, 4) and eat the apple. (Score 16, Length 17).\n4. **T=53:** From (4, 4), move **RIGHT** to (5, 4) and eat the apple. (Score 17, Length 18).\n5. **T=54:** From (5, 4) move **DOWN** to (5, 3) and eat the apple. (Score 18, Length 19).\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Looking at the board, my head is at **(5,8)**. My body is: `[(6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (7,6), (7,7)]`. Apples are at: `(9,1), (5,4), (5,3), (9,2), (4,4)`. Enemy snake #0 head is at **(2,5)**.\n\n**Immediate safety check for each possible move from (5,8):**\n\n- **UP to (5,9)**: Check board: Row 9, column 5 is '.' (empty). Not in my body. Not in enemy body. Within bounds. Safe.\n- **DOWN to (5,7)**: Check board: Row 7, column 5 is '.' (empty). Not in my body. Not in enemy body. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (4,8)**: Check board: Row 8, column 4 is '.' (empty). Not in my body. Not in enemy body. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (6,8)**: This is my own body (the second segment in my body list). Moving into my own body is fatal. Not safe.\n\nSo safe moves: **UP, DOWN, LEFT**.\n\n**Enemy head movement and collision risk:**\nEnemy head at (2,5). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (2,6): Empty.\n- DOWN to (2,4): Empty? Check board: Row 4, column 2 is 'T' (enemy body? Actually row 4 shows `. T . . A A . . . .`, so column 2 is 'T' - enemy body). So DOWN is into its own body \u2192 fatal.\n- LEFT to (1,5): Its own body (second segment). Fatal.\n- RIGHT to (3,5): Empty.\n\nSo enemy's only safe moves are **UP to (2,6)** and **RIGHT to (3,5)**. Neither of these squares overlaps with my candidate moves (5,9), (5,7), or (4,8). So no immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Strategic evaluation:**\n\n1.  **LEFT to (4,8)**: Moves away from my dense body cluster on the right. From (4,8), next turn I'd have options: UP (4,9), DOWN (4,7), LEFT (3,8). All three appear empty currently. Good mobility. It also moves me closer to the apple at (4,4) (straight down from (4,8) to (4,4)).\n2.  **DOWN to (5,7)**: Moves toward the column with apples at (5,4) and (5,3). From (5,7), next turn options: UP back to (5,8) is my body (old head becomes body), DOWN (5,6) empty, LEFT (4,7) empty, RIGHT (6,7) empty? Row 7 col6 is '.' (empty). So DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT would be safe. Good mobility and progresses toward apples.\n3.  **UP to (5,9)**: Moves to top edge. From (5,9), next turn options: UP off board (dead), DOWN to (5,8) my body, LEFT (4,9) empty, RIGHT (6,9) empty. So only LEFT and RIGHT are safe. This is risky as it reduces future options.\n\n**Long-term plan:** The enemy has a significant lead (15 apples vs my 11). I need to aggressively but safely collect apples. The cluster at (5,4), (5,3), and (4,4) is reachable. My current position (5,8) is directly above this column. Moving DOWN seems most direct, but moving LEFT to (4,8) also sets up a descent and might be safer by moving away from my long body which could create traps.\n\n**Considering apple proximity:**\n- DOWN gets me closer to (5,4) and (5,3).\n- LEFT gets me closer to (4,4).\n\nBoth are good. However, moving DOWN to (5,7) keeps me in the same column as two apples, which might be efficient. I should also consider that my body occupies (6,8) behind me, so moving DOWN doesn't risk immediate trapping.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move DOWN to (5,7) to begin descending the column toward apples (5,4) and (5,3). Next turn, from (5,7), I can likely move DOWN again to (5,6), then (5,5), etc., while checking left/right options to avoid my own tail and the enemy. This path looks clear and offers multiple safe branches at each step.\n\n**Final choice:** DOWN provides a clear, safe path toward multiple apples while maintaining good future mobility. UP is too restrictive. LEFT is safe but slightly less direct to the main apple cluster.\n\nDOWN",

The tail segment (3, 0) will shed this turn, opening up (3, 0) for movement.\n\n**ID 0 Body (excluding head):** [(2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0)]. (15 segments)\n\n**Forbidden positions for ID 0 (before enemy movement):**\n1.  **Borders:** None.\n2.  **Own body:** Forbidden: Neck (2, 5). The rest of the body is away from (3, 5). Safe: (3, 0) (tail sheds).\n3.  **Enemy body (T1):** T1 length 12. Body segments: [(5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (7, 6)].\n\n### Safety Evaluation for H0 at (3, 5):\n\n1.  **UP (to 3, 6):** Safe. Open space.\n2.  **DOWN (to 3, 4):** Safe. Open space.\n3.  **LEFT (to 2, 5):** Collision with neck (2, 5). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 4, 5):** Safe. Open space.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n### Enemy Prediction (H1 at 5, 7):\nH1 is at (5, 7). It is moving towards the central apples A2, A3, and A5, located at (5, 4), (5, 3), and (4, 4).\n\nS1's forbidden positions:\n1.  **Borders:** None.\n2.  **Own Body:** Neck (5, 8) and body segments.\n3.  **My Body:** None nearby.\n4.  **My Head:** H0 at (3, 5).\n\nPossible moves for S1 (from 5, 7):\n1.  **UP (to 5, 8):** Collision with neck (5, 8). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 6):** Safe. This is the optimal move to reach apples A2/A3 quickly. (Dist 2 to A2(5, 4)).\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 7):** Safe. Keeps S1 flexible and near A5(4, 4).\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 7):** Safe. Less direct but keeps S1 away from center.\n\nS1 is highly likely to move **DOWN** to (5, 6) or **LEFT** to (4, 7) to approach the apple cluster.\n\n### Head-on Collision Check (H0 vs H1):\n*   H0 potential moves: (3, 6), (3, 4), (4, 5).\n*   H1 potential moves: (5, 6), (4, 7), (6, 7).\nNo head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n### Evaluating My Safe Moves (H0 at 3, 5):\n\nThe game plan established last turn was to move RIGHT twice, then DOWN to eat the apple at (4, 4).\n\n1. **RIGHT (to 4, 5):** This moves me one step closer to A5 (4, 4) and A2 (5, 4).\n    *   From (4, 5), the path to A5 (4, 4) is 1 step DOWN.\n    *   From (4, 5), the path to A2 (5, 4) is 1 step RIGHT.\n    *   This move implements step 2 of the prior plan. It is highly advantageous as it secures my position for the next two apple captures.\n\n2. **DOWN (to 3, 4):** This move puts me directly on the vertical line with S1's predicted movement (S1 -> 5, 6). While it is still safe and keeps the target apples nearby, moving RIGHT (to 4, 5) forces me ahead of S1 in the sequence of apple captures.\n\n3. **UP (to 3, 6):** This diverts me from the immediate apple cluster and cedes spatial control to S1. This is a defensive move that is not necessary yet.\n\n**Conclusion:** The planned move **RIGHT** to (4, 5) is the best option. It maintains the offensive pressure, puts me in a position to eat A5 (4, 4) next turn, and then immediately target A2 (5, 4) and A3 (5, 3). Even if S1 moves DOWN to (5, 6), I will still reach (4, 4) before S1 can interfere.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update:\n1. **T=51 (Current):** Move **RIGHT** to (4, 5). Set up for A5 (4, 4).\n2. **T=52:** Move **DOWN** to (4, 4) and eat A5. (Score 16, Length 17).\n3. **T=53:** Move **RIGHT** to (5, 4) and eat A2. (Score 17, Length 18).\n4. **T=54:** Move **DOWN** to (5, 3) and eat A3. (Score 18, Length 19).\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current board:\n\n**Immediate safety check for each possible move from (5,7):**\n\n- **UP to (5,8):** This is my own body (the second segment, (5,8)). Moving into my own body is fatal. Not safe.\n- **DOWN to (5,6):** Check board: Row 6, column 5 is '.' (empty). Not in my body. Not in enemy body. Within bounds. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (4,7):** Check board: Row 7, column 4 is '.' (empty). Not in my body. Not in enemy body. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (6,7):** Check board: Row 7, column 6 is '.' (empty). Not in my body. Not in enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: **DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT**.\n\n**Enemy head movement and collision risk:**\nEnemy head at (3,5). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (3,6): Empty.\n- DOWN to (3,4): Empty? Row 4, column 3 is '.' (empty).\n- LEFT to (2,5): Its own body (second segment). Fatal.\n- RIGHT to (4,5): Empty.\n\nSo enemy's safe moves are **UP, DOWN, RIGHT**. None of these squares overlap with my candidate safe squares (5,6), (4,7), or (6,7). So no immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Strategic evaluation:**\n\n1.  **DOWN to (5,6):** Moves directly toward the apples at (5,4) and (5,3). From (5,6), next turn I'd have options: UP back to (5,7) is my body, DOWN (5,5) empty, LEFT (4,6) empty, RIGHT (6,6) empty. So DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT would be safe. This is a direct path to the apple cluster and maintains good mobility.\n2.  **LEFT to (4,7):** Moves toward the apple at (4,4). From (4,7), next turn options: UP (4,8) empty, DOWN (4,6) empty, LEFT (3,7) empty. All three appear safe. Good mobility and gets closer to (4,4).\n3.  **RIGHT to (6,7):** Moves away from the apple cluster and toward the right edge where my body is densely packed. From (6,7), next turn options: UP (6,8) is my body, DOWN (6,6) empty, LEFT (5,7) my body, RIGHT (7,7) empty. So only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. This reduces future options and moves into a more congested area.\n\n**Long-term plan:** My goal is to catch up to the enemy (15 apples vs my 11). The apple cluster at (5,4), (5,3), and (4,4) is the primary target. Moving DOWN is the most direct route to two apples. Moving LEFT is a good alternative that also targets an apple and may offer a safer path around my own body. RIGHT is suboptimal as it moves away from apples and into a potential trap.\n\n**Considering future safety:** My long body creates a risk of trapping myself if I loop back into it. Moving DOWN into column 5 seems promising because the column below is currently clear down to row 4 (apple) and row 3 (apple). I should plan to descend, eat (5,4), then (5,3), while being mindful of my tail's position.\n\n**Final choice:** DOWN provides the most direct path to two apples while keeping multiple safe moves available next turn. LEFT is also good, but DOWN is more efficient.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Continue moving DOWN toward (5,4) and (5,3). After eating (5,4), consider moving LEFT to (4,4) or continuing DOWN to (5,3) based on safety checks. Avoid moving right into my body cluster.\n\nDOWN",

Length: 16 (Did not grow last turn, tail is shedding from (4, 0)).\n    *   Neck: (3, 5).\n    *   Apples collected: 15.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   Head (H1): (5, 6). Length: 12 (Did not grow last turn, tail is shedding from (8, 6)).\n    *   Neck: (5, 7).\n    *   Apples collected: 11.\n*   **Apples Remaining (A):** A1 (9, 1), A2 (5, 4), A3 (5, 3), A4 (9, 2), A5 (4, 4). (Total 5 apples).\n\n**Observation:** My last move was RIGHT, successfully positioning H0 at (4, 5). Snake 1 moved DOWN, positioning H1 at (5, 6). This was the expected enemy move, bringing S1 2 steps away from A2 (5, 4) and 3 steps from A5 (4, 4). My position at (4, 5) places me 1 step from A5 (4, 4) and 1 step from A2/A3 (via (5, 5) or (4, 4) then (5, 4)). I have the advantage to grab A5 this turn.\n\n### My Snake (ID 0) Movement Details:\nH0 is at (4, 5). The snake length is 16. The tail segment (4, 0) will shed this turn, opening up (4, 0) for movement.\n\n**ID 0 Body (excluding head):** [(3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0) - *will shed*].\n\n**Forbidden positions for ID 0 (before enemy movement):**\n1.  **Borders:** None.\n2.  **Own body:** Neck (3, 5).\n3.  **Enemy body (T1):** T1 segments are far away. (5, 7 is the closest body segment).\n\n### Safety Evaluation for H0 at (4, 5):\n\n1.  **UP (to 4, 6):** Safe. Open space.\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, 4):** Collision with Apple A5. **SAFE (EAT APPLE)**.\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 5):** Collision with neck (3, 5). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 5):** Safe. Open space, one square away from H1 at (5, 6).\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN (Apple), RIGHT.\n\n### Enemy Prediction (H1 at 5, 6):\nH1 is at (5, 6). S1 is competing for A2/A3/A5. Since I am positioned to take A5 by moving DOWN, S1 will likely focus on A2 (5, 4).\n\nPossible moves for S1 (from 5, 6):\n1.  **UP (to 5, 7):** Collision with neck (5, 7). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 5):** Optimal move to approach A2 (5, 4) and A3 (5, 3). This blocks my path on the right side if I move RIGHT.\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 6):** Indirect approach. Puts S1 2 steps from A5 if I miss it.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 6):** Moves S1 away from the immediate cluster. Least likely aggressive move.\n\n**S1 Highly Predicted Move:** DOWN to (5, 5). S1 wants A2/A3.\n\n### Head-on/Side Collision Check (H0 vs H1):\n*   H0 moves DOWN to (4, 4) (Apple A5).\n*   H1 moves DOWN to (5, 5).\nNo collision risk.\n\n*   H0 moves RIGHT to (5, 5).\n*   H1 moves DOWN to (5, 5).\n**Head-on Collision Risk at (5, 5)!** If I attempt to go to (5, 5) and S1 moves DOWN, both snakes die. Therefore, **RIGHT is a DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\n### Evaluating My Safe Moves (H0 at 4, 5):\n\nThe pre-planned move was to take A5 at (4, 4) this turn, then A2 at (5, 4) next turn.\n\n1. **DOWN (to 4, 4), eating A5:**\n    *   **Result:** Snake grows, score 16. H0 is at (4, 4).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe, as S1 moving DOWN lands at (5, 5).\n    *   **Next step:** From (4, 4), I can move RIGHT to (5, 4) (Apple A2), securing the next apple.\n    *   This is the optimal move.\n\n2. **UP (to 4, 6):**\n    *   **Result:** Open space. Gives up A5 to S1's potential LEFT movement, and cedes spatial control. Not competitive.\n\n3. **RIGHT (to 5, 5):**\n    *   **Result:** Highly likely head-on collision with S1 moving DOWN to (5, 5). **DANGER.**\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving **DOWN** to eat A5 (4, 4) is perfectly safe and perfectly executed according to plan. This move denies A5 to the opponent and sets up the immediate capture of A2 and A3.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update:\n1. **T=52 (Current):** Move **DOWN** to (4, 4) and eat A5. (Score 16, Length 17).\n2. **T=53:** Move **RIGHT** to (5, 4) and eat A2. (Score 17, Length 18).\n3. **T=54:** Move **DOWN** to (5, 3) and eat A3. (Score 18, Length 19).\n4. **T=55:** Exit the area (likely DOWN to (5, 2), then RIGHT). S1 will likely be stuck around (5, 5) or (5, 6) after these captures.\n\nDOWN",

Its possible moves:\n- UP to (4,6): This is my candidate LEFT move square. **Potential head-on collision risk.**\n- DOWN to (4,4): Contains an apple 'A'.\n- LEFT to (3,5): Its own body (second segment). Fatal.\n- RIGHT to (5,5): This is my candidate DOWN move square. **Potential head-on collision risk.**\n\nSo enemy's safe moves are **UP and DOWN**. These squares overlap with my candidate safe squares (4,6) for LEFT and (5,5) for DOWN. So there is a risk of head-on collision if we both choose the same square.\n\n**Strategic evaluation:**\n\n1.  **DOWN to (5,5):** Moves directly toward the apples at (5,4) and (5,3). However, the enemy could also move RIGHT to (5,5), causing a head-on collision and both of us dying. This is a high-risk, high-reward move.\n2.  **LEFT to (4,6):** Moves toward the apple at (4,4). The enemy could move UP to (4,6), also causing a head-on collision. Same high-risk situation.\n3.  **RIGHT to (6,6):** Moves away from the apple cluster and toward the right edge where my body is densely packed. From (6,6), next turn options: UP (6,7) empty, DOWN (6,5) empty, LEFT (5,6) my old head position (will be empty next turn), RIGHT (7,6) empty. This move does not conflict with the enemy's safe moves (UP to (4,6) or DOWN to (4,4)). It is the only move with **no risk of immediate head-on collision**.\n\n**Long-term plan:** My primary goal is to stay alive and close the apple gap. Moving RIGHT into (6,6) is the safest immediate choice. It avoids a potential fatal clash and keeps me alive. While it moves away from the main apple cluster, it opens up the board's center-right area, which is currently less congested. From (6,6), I can reassess next turn\u2014I could go DOWN toward (6,5) which is closer to the apple at (5,4), or go RIGHT/UP to navigate around my body.\n\n**Considering enemy behavior:** The enemy snake has 15 apples and a long body. It is likely to prioritize eating the apple at (4,4) by moving DOWN. If it does that, the squares (4,6) and (5,5) become safe for me next turn. However, I cannot rely on that assumption. The safest play is to avoid the conflict zone entirely this turn.\n\n**Final choice:** RIGHT is the only move with zero chance of a head-on collision this turn. Survival is paramount.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After moving RIGHT to (6,6), aim to descend toward the lower-left apple cluster while monitoring the enemy's position. Potential path: next turn DOWN to (6,5), then LEFT to (5,5) or (5,4) if safe. Avoid boxing myself in against the right wall and my own body.\n\nRIGHT",

Length: 17 (Grew last turn, tail remains at (4, 0)).\n    *   Neck: (4, 5).\n    *   Apples collected: 16.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   Head (H1): (6, 6). Length: 12 (Moved RIGHT from (5, 6) to (6, 6). This is an unexpected move, as I predicted DOWN).\n    *   Neck: (5, 6).\n    *   Apples collected: 11.\n*   **Apples Remaining (A):** A1 (9, 1), A2 (5, 4), A3 (5, 3), A4 (9, 2), A5 (3, 9). (Total 5 apples).\n    *   *Note: Apple at (4, 4) was eaten last turn.*\n\n**Observation:** My last move (DOWN) successfully secured the apple at (4, 4). Snake 1 moved RIGHT from (5, 6) to (6, 6), which was highly unexpected as it moved away from the cluster of apples (5, 4), (5, 3). H1 is now at (6, 6), directly adjacent to its body segment (6, 8). H0 is at (4, 4), perfectly positioned to strike A2 (5, 4) this turn.\n\n### My Snake (ID 0) Movement Details:\nH0 is at (4, 4). The snake length is 17. The tail segment (4, 0) remains stable this turn since an apple was eaten.\n\n**ID 0 Body (excluding head):** [(4, 5), (3, 5), ..., (4, 0)].\n\n**Forbidden positions for ID 0 (before enemy movement):**\n1.  **Borders:** None.\n2.  **Own body:** Neck (4, 5).\n3.  **Enemy body (T1):** T1 segments are at (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8), etc. The closest is (5, 4) -- wait, no, (5, 6) is the closest segment.\n\n### Safety Evaluation for H0 at (4, 4):\n\n1.  **UP (to 4, 5):** Collision with neck (4, 5). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, 3):** Safe. Open space.\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 4):** Safe. Open space.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 4):** Collision with Apple A2. **SAFE (EAT APPLE)**.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (Apple).\n\n### Enemy Prediction (H1 at 6, 6):\nH1 is at (6, 6). S1's move was strange. It placed its head between its body (6, 8) and its neck (5, 6). Its current position (6, 6) is:\n*   Adjacent to T1 body (6, 2) which is my segment. Not dangerous.\n*   Adjacent to its own body (6, 8) if it moves UP.\n\nS1 is 2 steps away from A5 (3, 9) and far from the current apple cluster. Given H1 is at (6, 6), its likely goals are now:\n1.  Move towards A3 (5, 3) or A4/A1 (9, 2), potentially using the space opened up by its previous move.\n2.  Move to prevent me from continuing to dominate the immediate apple cluster.\n\nPossible moves for S1 (from 6, 6):\n1.  **UP (to 6, 7):** Safe, moves towards A5 (3, 9).\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 5):** Safe, moves maybe towards A3 (5, 3).\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 6):** Collision with neck (5, 6). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 6):** Safe, moves towards border/A1/A4.\n\n**Most Likely S1 Moves:** UP (to 6, 7) or RIGHT (to 7, 6) to pursue other apples, or DOWN to (6, 5) to reposition.\n\n### Head-on/Side Collision Check (H0 vs H1):\nH0 is moving RIGHT to (5, 4).\nH1 is far away at (6, 6).\nNo collision risk.\n\n### Evaluating My Safe Moves (H0 at 4, 4):\n\n1. **RIGHT (to 5, 4), eating A2:**\n    *   **Result:** Snake grows, score 17. H0 is at (5, 4).\n    *   **Safety:** Perfect. The move secures another apple per the plan.\n    *   **Next step:** From (5, 4), I can move DOWN to (5, 3) (Apple A3), securing the third apple in quick succession.\n    *   This is the optimal move.\n\n2. **DOWN (to 4, 3):**\n    *   **Result:** Safe, but gives up A2 (5, 4) to Snake 1 if it decides to make an aggressive maneuver (e.g., to 5, 5, despite the risk of collision with its body later). Unnecessary risk.\n\n3. **LEFT (to 3, 4):**\n    *   **Result:** Safe, but moves away from the priority target A2 (5, 4). Not competitive.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving **RIGHT** to eat A2 (5, 4) is safe and maintains offensive pressure, following the established plan to clear the central apple cluster.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update:\n1. **T=53 (Current):** Move **RIGHT** to (5, 4) and eat A2. (Score 17, Length 18).\n2. **T=54:** Move **DOWN** to (5, 3) and eat A3. (Score 18, Length 19).\n3. **T=55:** Exit the area (likely DOWN to (5, 2), then RIGHT to (6, 2), etc.). Snake 1 is moving towards the right side of the board and may target A1/A4. I need to reposition after clearing A3.\n\nRIGHT",

          "move": "DOWN",
          "rationale": "Looking at my current position **(6,6)**:\n\n**Immediate safety check for each possible move:**\n\n- **UP to (6,7):** Check board: Row 7, column 6 is '.' (empty). Not in my body. Not in enemy body. Safe.\n- **DOWN to (6,5):** Check board: Row 5, column 6 is '.' (empty). Not in my body. Not in enemy body. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (5,6):** Check board: Row 6, column 5 is 'T' (my tail segment from last turn). My body list shows (5,6) is my second segment. However, I moved from (5,6) to (6,6). My tail will move from (9,6) to (9,5)? Wait, let's trace: My body is [(5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6)]. My head moved from (5,6) to (6,6). So my new head is (6,6), and my old head (5,6) is now the first body segment. My tail is (9,6). When I move this turn, my tail will move forward? In Snake, the entire body shifts: the head moves to a new cell, each body segment moves into the position of the segment ahead of it, and the tail cell is vacated unless I eat an apple. I did not eat an apple last turn (no apple at (6,6)), so my length stays the same. Therefore, after my move last turn, my body should be: New head (6,6), then old head (5,6) becomes segment 2, then (5,7), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (9,7), and the tail (9,6) will be removed. So the cell (5,6) is occupied by my body this turn. Moving LEFT to (5,6) would be moving into my own body. **Not safe.**\n- **RIGHT to (7,6):** Check board: Row 6, column 7 is '.' (empty). Not in my body. Not in enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: **UP, DOWN, RIGHT**.\n\n**Enemy head movement and collision risk:**\nEnemy head at **(4,4)**. Its possible moves:\n- UP to (4,5): Its own body (second segment, (4,5)). Fatal.\n- DOWN to (4,3): Check board: Row 3, column 4 is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- LEFT to (3,4): Check board: Row 4, column 3 is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- RIGHT to (5,4): Contains an apple 'A'. Safe.\n\nEnemy's safe moves are **DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT**. None of these directly overlap with my safe squares (6,7), (6,5), (7,6). However, we must consider that snakes move simultaneously. My candidate squares are not in the enemy's immediate move set, so no risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\n**Strategic evaluation:**\n\n1. **UP to (6,7):** Moves up toward the top-right where my body is coiled (rows 8-9). This area is congested with my own body. It might lead to getting trapped soon. Not ideal.\n2. **DOWN to (6,5):** Moves toward the apple cluster at (5,4) and (5,3). From (6,5), next turn I could go LEFT to (5,5) to approach apples. However, (5,5) might be a contested square next turn if enemy moves RIGHT to (5,4) and then considers (5,5). Still, it's a move toward food.\n3. **RIGHT to (7,6):** Moves further right, closer to the wall and my dense body area. From (7,6), next moves: UP (7,7) empty, DOWN (7,5) empty, RIGHT (8,6) empty, LEFT (6,6) will be empty. This keeps options open but moves away from apples.\n\n**Apple accessibility:**\nApples at: (9,1), (5,4), (5,3), (9,2), (3,9). Closest to me: (5,4) and (5,3) are 2-3 moves away if I go DOWN then LEFT. (3,9) is far. (9,1) and (9,2) are near my tail but risky to reach through my own body.\n\n**Long-term plan:** I need to close the apple gap (11 vs 16). Moving DOWN to (6,5) positions me best to go for (5,4) or (5,3) next turn, while staying clear of the enemy's likely path. The enemy at (4,4) will likely go for the apple at (5,4) by moving RIGHT, or (4,3) by moving DOWN. If it moves RIGHT to (5,4), then my path to (5,4) might be blocked, but I could target (5,3) instead. Moving DOWN seems the most aggressive toward reducing the apple difference.\n\n**Safety of DOWN (6,5):** Check future safety: From (6,5), possible next moves: UP back to (6,6), DOWN to (6,4), LEFT to (5,5), RIGHT to (7,5). All those squares are currently empty. It seems safe and keeps options open.\n\n**Final choice:** DOWN positions me optimally toward the apples while maintaining safety and avoiding immediate collision risks.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (6,5), aim to move LEFT to (5,5) if safe, then down to (5,4) for the apple, provided enemy doesn't occupy it. Monitor enemy head position closely to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nDOWN",

Length: 18 (Grew last turn, tail remains at (4, 0)).\n    *   Neck: (4, 4).\n    *   Apples collected: 17.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n    *   Head (H1): (7, 6). Length: 12 (Moved RIGHT from (6, 6) to (7, 6)).\n    *   Neck: (6, 6).\n    *   Apples collected: 11.\n*   **Apples Remaining (A):** A1 (9, 1), A2 (5, 3), A3 (9, 2), A4 (3, 9), A5 (8, 0). (Total 5 apples).\n    *   *Note: Apple at (5, 4) was eaten by me last turn. Apple list adjusted.*\n\n**Observation:** My last move (RIGHT) successfully secured the apple at (5, 4) and repositioned H0 to (5, 4). Snake 1 moved RIGHT from (6, 6) to (7, 6), continuing its path eastward, away from the central apple cluster. My current head position (5, 4) is perfectly adjacent to **Apple A2 (5, 3)**.\n\n### My Snake (ID 0) Movement Details:\nH0 is at (5, 4). The snake length is 18. The tail segment (4, 0) remains stable this turn since an apple was eaten last turn.\n\n**ID 0 Body (excluding head):** [(4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5), ..., (4, 0)].\n\n**Forbidden positions for ID 0 (before enemy movement):**\n1.  **Borders:** None.\n2.  **Own body:** Neck (4, 4).\n3.  **Enemy body (T1):** T1 segments are at (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8), etc. None are immediately adjacent.\n\n### Safety Evaluation for H0 at (5, 4):\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 5)**: Safe. Open space.\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 3)**: Collision with Apple A2. **SAFE (EAT APPLE)**.\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 4)**: Collision with neck (4, 4). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 4)**: Safe. Open space.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN (Apple), RIGHT.\n\n### Enemy Prediction (H1 at 7, 6):\nH1 is at (7, 6). S1 is clearly moving towards the right side of the board, perhaps targeting A3 (9, 2) or A1 (9, 1).\n\nPossible safe moves for S1 (from 7, 6), assuming neck (6, 6) frees up:\n1.  **UP (to 7, 7):** Safe. Keeps moving up towards the top wall/corner.\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 5):** Safe. Moves toward the center/right lower apples (A1, A3, A5).\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 6):** Safe now (neck segment (6, 6) is popped). Moves towards my area, but delayed.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 6):** Safe. Continues right.\n\n**Most Likely S1 Moves:** DOWN (to 7, 5) or RIGHT (to 8, 6) to consolidate a position for the bottom right apples. If it moves LEFT (to 6, 6), it might try to challenge me if I leave A2 (5, 3) open, but given my position, this seems unlikely for S1.\n\n### Head-on/Side Collision Check (H0 vs H1):\nH0 is moving DOWN to (5, 3).\nH1 is moving to (7, 5), (8, 6), (6, 6), or (7, 7).\nNo collision risk.\n\n### Evaluating My Safe Moves (H0 at 5, 4):\n\n1. **DOWN (to 5, 3), eating A2:**\n    *   **Result:** Snake grows, score 18. H0 is at (5, 3).\n    *   **Safety:** Perfect. This executes the short-term plan to clear the central cluster of apples.\n    *   **Next step:** From (5, 3), all immediate adjacent apples are consumed. I must plan an exit.\n\n2. **UP (to 5, 5):**\n    *   **Result:** Safe, but ignores the available apple A2 (5, 3), allowing S1 time to change course or potentially giving S1 an opportunity if it moves aggressively toward the center. Not optimal.\n\n3. **RIGHT (to 6, 4):**\n    *   **Result:** Safe, but ignores A2 (5, 3). Moves closer to S1's former path, which might be risky later if S1 turns back.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving **DOWN** to eat A2 (5, 3) is safe, optimal for scoring, and successfully concludes the operation to clear the central apple cluster.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update:\n1. **T=54 (Current):** Move **DOWN** to (5, 3) and eat A2. (Score 18, Length 19).\n2. **T=55:** H0 is at (5, 3). I need to move to the side of the board to pursue the remaining apples (A1, A3, A5). The quickest exit seems to be RIGHT to (6, 3), then DOWN towards A1 (9, 1) and A3 (9, 2). I must also watch S1 who is likely converging on the right side.\n3. **T=56+:** Use the open horizontal space (Row 3/2) to navigate right and secure A1/A3/A5, prioritizing A5 (8, 0) as it is in the corner and less defended by S1's current path (S1 is too high).\n\nDOWN",

My body list shows (6,6) is my second segment. Moving into my own body is fatal. **Not safe.**\n- **DOWN to (6,4):** Check board: Row 4, column 6 is '.' (empty). Not in my body. Not in enemy body. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (5,5):** Check board: Row 5, column 5 is '.' (empty). Not in my body. Not in enemy body. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (7,5):** Check board: Row 5, column 7 is '.' (empty). Not in my body. Not in enemy body. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: **DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT**.\n\n**Enemy head movement and collision risk:**\nEnemy head at **(5,4)**. Its possible moves:\n- UP to (5,5): Check board: Row 5, column 5 is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- DOWN to (5,3): Contains an apple 'A'. Safe.\n- LEFT to (4,4): Its own body (second segment, (4,4)). Fatal.\n- RIGHT to (6,4): Check board: Row 4, column 6 is '.' (empty). Safe.\n\nEnemy's safe moves are **UP, DOWN, RIGHT**. My candidate squares:\n- (6,4) (my DOWN) is also enemy's RIGHT. **Potential head-on collision if both choose these squares simultaneously.** Must avoid.\n- (5,5) (my LEFT) is enemy's UP. **Potential head-on collision.** Must avoid.\n- (7,5) (my RIGHT) is not in enemy's immediate move set, so safe from head-on collision.\n\nThus, considering simultaneous movement, only **RIGHT to (7,5)** avoids a possible head-on collision.\n\n**Strategic evaluation:**\n\n1. **RIGHT to (7,5):** Moves away from the apple cluster but keeps me safe. From (7,5), next moves could be UP (7,6), DOWN (7,4), RIGHT (8,5), LEFT back to (6,5). This area is relatively open, with my body concentrated in rows 8-9. It maintains flexibility.\n2. **LEFT to (5,5) and DOWN to (6,4)** are risky due to potential head-on collisions with the enemy's UP and RIGHT moves, respectively. Even if I think the enemy might choose another direction, I cannot guarantee it. Since survival is paramount, I should avoid these squares.\n\n**Apple accessibility:**\nApples at: (9,1), (5,3), (9,2), (3,9), (8,0). The closest are (5,3) and (8,0). Moving RIGHT doesn't directly approach any apple, but it keeps me alive to fight another turn. The enemy is at (5,4) and will likely eat (5,3) if it moves DOWN, increasing its lead. I need to stay alive and look for opportunities later.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nFrom (7,5), I can consider moving DOWN to (7,4) next turn to approach the apple at (8,0) or (9,1) via the bottom-right. Alternatively, I could loop around the left side to approach (3,9). The key is to avoid the enemy's immediate vicinity and my own body. My tail is at (9,6) and will move as I progress, potentially opening up space.\n\n**Final choice:** RIGHT is the only safe move that avoids a potential head-on collision. It keeps me alive with future options.\n\nRIGHT",

Length: 12 (Moved DOWN from (7, 6) to (7, 5) based on visual evidence, assuming last turn S1 moved DOWN).\n    *   Neck: (7, 6).\n    *   Apples collected: 11.\n*   **Apples Remaining (A):** A1 (9, 1), A2 (9, 2), A3 (3, 9), A4 (8, 0), A5 (4, 1). (Total 5 apples).\n    *   *Note: Apple at (5, 3) was eaten by me last turn, score updated to 18.*\n\n**Board Visualization (Recalculated from input body list):**\nThe input lists suggest that the visual board provided is accurate, given my move DOWN from (5, 4) to (5, 3).\n(5,4) is now my neck. (5,3) is my head.\nSnake 1's head is (7, 5). Its neck is (6, 5). This confirms Snake 1 moved RIGHT from (6, 5) to (7, 5). *Correction: The board shows H1 at (7, 5) and the next body segment at (6, 5), meaning S1 came from (6, 5). The previous turn's state might have been different, but based on the current *given* state, S1 moved right from (6, 5) to (7, 5). The previous rationale assumed S1 moved from (7, 6) to (7, 5), which is now contradicted by the current body list structure.*\n\nLet's stick to the current available data:\nH0 = (5, 3). Neck = (5, 4).\nH1 = (7, 5). Neck = (6, 5).\n\n### My Snake (ID 0) Movement Details:\nH0 is at (5, 3). Length 19. The tail segment (4, 0) remains stable this turn since an apple was eaten 2 turns ago, and I grew last turn.\n\n**ID 0 Body (excluding head):** [(5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0)].\n\n**Forbidden positions for ID 0 (before enemy movement):**\n1.  **Borders:** None immediately adjacent.\n2.  **Own body:** Neck (5, 4). Also (5, 2), (4, 4), (6, 2), etc.\n3.  **Enemy body (T1):** (6, 5). This segment is adjacent to (5, 5), (6, 4), (7, 5). Not adjacent to H0 (5, 3).\n\n**Safety Evaluation for H0 at (5, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 4)**: Collision with neck (5, 4). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 2)**: Collision with own body (5, 2). **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 3)**: Safe. Open space. Leads towards A5 (4, 1).\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 3)**: Safe. Open space. Leads towards the right side cluster (A1, A2, A4).\n\nSafe moves: LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Enemy Prediction (H1 at 7, 5):\nH1 is at (7, 5). Neck is (6, 5). S1 is currently blocking much of the right-center board.\nApples A1 (9, 1), A2 (9, 2), and A4 (8, 0) are close to S1.\n\nPossible safe moves for S1 (from 7, 5), given neck (6, 5) frees up:\n1.  **UP (to 7, 6):** Safe. Leaves open the direct route to the lower right apples.\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 4):** Safe. Moves toward A4 (8, 0) and A1/A2.\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 5):** Safe. Moves towards my snake.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 5):** Safe. Moves right, potentially setting up for the top border or a turn down towards A4.\n\nS1 is likely to move to secure the right-side apples, probably **DOWN (7, 4)** or **RIGHT (8, 5)**. Moving LEFT (6, 5) seems less aggressive towards Apples A1, A2, A4.\n\n### Head-on/Side Collision Check (H0 vs H1):\nH0 options: (4, 3) or (6, 3).\nH1 options: (7, 6), (7, 4), (6, 5), (8, 5).\nNo possibility of a lethal head-on or side collision at the next turn.\n\n### Evaluating My Safe Moves (H0 at 5, 3):\n\nI have successfully cleared the central apples and must now choose between the bottom-left apple A5 (4, 1) and the cluster on the right (A1, A2, A4) that S1 is currently threatening.\n\n1. **LEFT (to 4, 3):**\n    *   **Pros:** Directly targets A5 (4, 1). A5 is currently uncontested. Securing it means another growth and points.\n        *   Path to A5: (5, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 1) [Eat] (3 moves away). Note: (4, 2) is currently part of my body, but it will be vacated by the tail unless I grow this turn. Since I grew last turn, (4, 0) is still the tail. (4, 2) will *not* be vacated. This means the path is (5, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 1). Wait, (4, 2) is currently $B_11$ (11th segment from the head). It is too far from the tail $T$ (4, 0) to be available next turn.\n        *   Path to A5 (4, 1) must avoid (4, 2) and adjacent (5, 2), (3, 2).\n        *   Revised Path: (5, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 4) (Collision) -> Trap.\n        *   *Conclusion:* The path to A5 (4, 1) is currently extremely congested by my own body segments (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2). Moving LEFT risks getting trapped or wasting time trying to navigate the blockade. This is a very high-risk move series.\n\n2. **RIGHT (to 6, 3):**\n    *   **Pros:** Opens up the path to the right side of the board which is less congested by my own long body. Prepares for A4 (8, 0), A1 (9, 1), and A2 (9, 2).\n    *   **Cons:** S1 is close (H1 at 7, 5). I risk a race or collision if S1 decides to move down aggressively.\n    *   If I move R (6, 3) and S1 moves R (8, 5), I have a full two turns minimum to approach the apples A1/A2/A4.\n    *   If I move R (6, 3) and S1 moves D (7, 4), S1 is now strongly positioned for A4 (8, 0). I can still target A1 (9, 1) or A2 (9, 2).\n\nGiven that the path to A5 (4, 1) via LEFT is almost impossible without hitting my own body segments that won't move in time, I must pivot RIGHT and accept a contest for the remaining apples with S1.\n\n**Optimal Move Strategy: RIGHT**\nMove **RIGHT** to (6, 3). This avoids internal body congestion and sets up a race against S1 for the right-side apples.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update:\n1. **T=55 (Current):** Move **RIGHT** to (6, 3). (H0 approaches right-side apples, length 19).\n2. **T=56:** H0 is at (6, 3). Assess S1's new position (likely securing A4 or A2/A1). If S1 is high (e.g., 7, 6 or 8, 5), prioritize A4 (8, 0) by moving DOWN (6, 2 - dangerous body segment), or RIGHT (7, 3). Since (6, 2) is a body segment, I must move RIGHT to (7, 3), then possibly DOWN/RIGHT towards the lower corner.\n3. **T=57+:** Execute the path to secure the most viable eastern apple(s).\n\nRIGHT",

None of my safe moves risk a head-on collision with the enemy\u2019s possible destinations.  \n\nStrategic evaluation:  \n- **UP** to (7,6) moves away from most apples and limits future moves (only UP and RIGHT would be safe next turn).  \n- **DOWN** to (7,4) improves distances to apples at (9,2), (9,1), and (8,0) while opening three safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) next turn, providing flexibility.  \n- **RIGHT** to (8,5) also improves distances to several apples but moves closer to the right wall, which may restrict future movement.  \n\nDOWN positions me in clearer territory (lower rows have fewer body segments) and away from the enemy\u2019s likely path. Given the need to catch up in apples (11 vs. 18) and maintain maneuverability, DOWN is the best choice.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (7,4), aim to safely approach the apples at (9,2) and (9,1) by moving down and right along the bottom, while monitoring the enemy\u2019s position and avoiding its body.  \n\nDOWN",

The last move was RIGHT from (5, 3) to (6, 3).\n\n### Safety Evaluation for H0 at (6, 3):\n\n**Snake 0 Body Segments (B0):** Neck (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0).\n*Note: The tail (T0) is (5, 0). Since I did not eat an apple on Turn 55, T0 at (5, 0) will move to (6, 0), and (6, 0) will move to (6, 1), etc., vacating (5, 0) next turn.*\n\n**1. UP (to 6, 4):**\n    *   Adjacent to S1 body segment (6, 5) and free space (7, 4) (where H1 is now).\n    *   Safe from self/wall collision.\n    *   **Safe.**\n\n**2. DOWN (to 6, 2):**\n    *   Collision with own body segment (6, 2).\n    *   **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\n**3. LEFT (to 5, 3):**\n    *   Collision with neck (5, 3). Moving backwards.\n    *   **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\n**4. RIGHT (to 7, 3):**\n    *   Adjacent to H1 (7, 4) and S1 body (7, 5).\n    *   Safe from self/wall collision.\n    *   **Safe.**\n\nSafe moves: UP (6, 4), RIGHT (7, 3).\n\n### Enemy Prediction (H1 at 7, 4):\nH1 is at (7, 4). Neck is (7, 5). H1 is positioned between my snake and the right-side apples (A1, A2, A4).\n\nPossible safe moves for S1 (from 7, 4), given neck (7, 5) frees up:\n1.  **UP (to 7, 5):** Collision with neck (7, 5). **DANGER**.\n2.  **DOWN (to 7, 3):** Targets A4 (8, 0). This is a fast move towards the corner.\n3.  **LEFT (to 6, 4):** Targets my head area (6, 3). Potential for a head-on collision if I move UP to (6, 4), or a cut-off if I move RIGHT.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 8, 4):** Sets up for A4 (8, 0) or A1/A2 (9, 1)/(9, 2).\n\nS1 will likely prioritize apples or aggressive maneuvering.\n*   If S1 moves **DOWN (7, 3)**: It targets A4. I survive.\n*   If S1 moves **RIGHT (8, 4)**: Targets A4/A2/A1. I survive.\n*   If S1 moves **LEFT (6, 4)**:\n    *   If I move UP (6, 4): Head-on collision. **Lethal to both.**\n    *   If I move RIGHT (7, 3): S1 occupies (6, 4), cutting me off potentially from the top area, but leaving the route to (7, 3) open.\n\n### Evaluating My Safe Moves and Collision Avoidance:\n\nI am contesting the right side for A1 (9, 1), A2 (9, 2), and A4 (8, 0). A4 (8, 0) is the closest in terms of open space.\n\n**1. UP (to 6, 4):**\n*   **Risk:** High risk of collision if S1 moves LEFT (6, 4). If S1 does move LEFT, we both die.\n*   **Reward:** Opens up the path towards A3 (3, 9) or allows maneuvering around the top of S1's long body.\n*   *Conclusion:* Too risky due to the high probability of S1 moving LEFT to cut me off or simply because it's a safe move for them.\n\n**2. RIGHT (to 7, 3):**\n*   **Risk:** Safe from S1 moving LEFT/RIGHT/UP. If S1 moves DOWN (7, 3), it's a head-on collision.\n*   **Reward:** Directly approaches the lower right quadrant, setting up for A4 (8, 0) or moving along the Y=3 row toward A1/A2.\n*   *Collision Check:* If S1 moves DOWN to **(7, 3)** and I move RIGHT to **(7, 3)**, we collide and both die. This is the primary risk. Moving DOWN (7, 3) is a strong apple-targeting move for H1.\n\n**Comparing Risks (H1 is at 7, 4):**\n*   Move UP (6, 4): Risky if H1 moves LEFT (6, 4).\n*   Move RIGHT (7, 3): Risky if H1 moves DOWN (7, 3).\n\nBoth *LEFT* for S1 and *DOWN* for S1 are strategically sound moves. However, S1 just moved to (7, 4); moving DOWN to (7, 3) makes a beeline for A4 (8, 0), which is common aggression. Moving LEFT to (6, 4) is aggressive towards me (cut-off or collision).\n\nLet's prioritize safety by selecting a move that minimizes the chances of a mutual kill. S1 is currently one square above (7, 3). S1 is two squares away from (6, 4).\n\nIf I move **UP (6, 4)**:\n*   If S1 goes RIGHT (8, 4) or DOWN (7, 3): I live.\n*   If S1 goes LEFT (6, 4): Mutual death.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT (7, 3)**:\n*   If S1 goes LEFT (6, 4) or RIGHT (8, 4): I live.\n*   If S1 goes DOWN (7, 3): Mutual death.\n\nSince (7, 3) is currently empty space leading directly towards A4, moving RIGHT is the primary, apple-focused path. H1 has a strong incentive to move DOWN towards A4.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Move to an area where S1 has no interest.**\nThe top left apple A3 (3, 9) is safe, but far.\n\n**Path Correction:**\nIf I choose **UP (6, 4)**: I still have the flexibility to go RIGHT (7, 4, if S1 moves, or to 7, 5 later). I can also maneuver around the high ground.\nIf I choose **RIGHT (7, 3)**: I commit to the low ground. If S1 moves DOWN, I die. If S1 moves RIGHT or LEFT, I secure a good position for A4 or A1/A2.\n\nThe safest move that maintains offensive pressure is to **move to a cell adjacent to H1, but in a direction H1 is unlikely to move aggressively towards.**\n\nH1's neck is (7, 5). H1 cannot move UP to (7, 5).\nH1's options are DOWN (7, 3), LEFT (6, 4), or RIGHT (8, 4).\n\nIf I move to **(7, 3)**, I contest H1's move to (7, 3).\nIf I move to **(6, 4)**, I contest H1's move to (6, 4).\n\nBetween (6, 4) and (7, 3), (7, 3) seems more immediately desirable for S1 to reach the apple A4 (8, 0) quickly. My move **UP** to (6, 4) avoids this direct line of fire and positions me to intercept S1 if they move RIGHT (8, 4) or to race if they move DOWN (7, 3).\n\nLet's proceed with **UP** to (6, 4). This move is equally risky to the RIGHT move, but it opens the path above S1's body for long-term maneuverability toward the eastern apples, offering a better retreat or lateral movement option if needed, compared to being pinned in the corner at (7, 3).\n\n---\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n1. **T=56 (Current):** Move **UP** to (6, 4). This avoids the immediate conflict point at (7, 3) with H1's most aggressive apple pursuit path (DOWN to 7, 3).\n2. **T=57:** Assess H1 position. If H1 moved DOWN or RIGHT, proceed RIGHT (7, 4) or UP (6, 5 - collision with T1 body) or (6, 6 - free space). If (6, 5) is open (because T1 vacated the neck (7, 5) and moved everything one step), this is a solid move. Wait, (6, 5) is T1 body, which won't move until T1 tail is vacated. Since S1 is length 12, (6, 5) is segment 3. It will vacate only upon S1 eating an apple. We must go towards (7, 4) or (6, 6).\n3. **T=57+:** Focus on maneuvering around S1 to capture A1 (9, 1) and A2 (9, 2). Abandon A4 for now if S1 is targeting it aggressively.\n\nUP",

No enemy body there. \u2705 **SAFE**\n- **LEFT** to (6,4): Check board: (6,4) is empty ('.'). \u2705 **SAFE**\n- **RIGHT** to (8,4): Check board: (8,4) is empty ('.'). \u2705 **SAFE**\n\nSo three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy snake #0 possible moves from (6,3):**\n- UP to (6,4) - That's my LEFT move destination.\n- DOWN to (6,2) - Occupied by enemy's own body (segment at (6,2)). \u274c\n- LEFT to (5,3) - Occupied by enemy's own body (segment at (5,3)). \u274c\n- RIGHT to (7,3) - That's my DOWN move destination.\n\nSo enemy has only two safe moves: UP to (6,4) and RIGHT to (7,3).\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**\n- If I move LEFT to (6,4) and enemy moves UP to (6,4), we'd collide \u2192 both die.\n- If I move DOWN to (7,3) and enemy moves RIGHT to (7,3), we'd collide \u2192 both die.\n- My RIGHT move to (8,4) doesn't conflict with enemy's possible safe moves.\n\n**Apple distances:**\n- (9,1): Distance from (7,4) = |7-9| + |4-1| = 2+3=5\n- (9,2): Distance = |7-9| + |4-2| = 2+2=4\n- (3,9): Distance = |7-3| + |4-9| = 4+5=9\n- (8,0): Distance = |7-8| + |4-0| = 1+4=5\n- (4,1): Distance = |7-4| + |4-1| = 3+3=6\n\nFrom potential new positions:\n- **RIGHT to (8,4)**: Closer to (9,1) dist=4, (9,2) dist=3, (8,0) dist=4\n- **LEFT to (6,4)**: Closer to (4,1) dist=4, (3,9) dist=8\n- **DOWN to (7,3)**: Closer to (4,1) dist=5, (8,0) dist=5\n\n**Future mobility from each position:**\n- **RIGHT to (8,4)**: Would have UP(8,5)-occupied by my body, DOWN(8,3)-empty, LEFT(7,4)-empty but my current head, RIGHT(9,4)-empty. So potentially 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT).\n- **LEFT to (6,4)**: UP(6,5)-occupied by my body, DOWN(6,3)-occupied by enemy head currently, LEFT(5,4)-occupied by enemy body, RIGHT(7,4)-empty but my current head. Actually only UP and RIGHT would be occupied, DOWN and LEFT occupied by enemy. Wait, enemy might move away from (6,3), but currently (6,3) is enemy head. After both move, (6,3) might be empty if enemy moves. But (5,4) is enemy body, so LEFT blocked. So from (6,4): UP blocked by my body at (6,5), DOWN to (6,3) - if enemy moves away could be safe but risky, LEFT to (5,4) enemy body blocked, RIGHT to (7,4) my old head position safe. So likely only 1 safe move (RIGHT back to where I came from) unless DOWN becomes safe.\n- **DOWN to (7,3)**: UP(7,4)-empty (my old head), DOWN(7,2)-empty, LEFT(6,3)-currently enemy head but enemy might move, RIGHT(8,3)-empty. So potentially 3 safe moves if enemy moves away from (6,3).\n\nConsidering head-on collision risk: Both LEFT and DOWN risk collision with enemy's possible moves. RIGHT to (8,4) has no collision risk since enemy can't reach (8,4) in one move.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\nI'm behind in apples (11 vs 18). Need to collect apples safely while avoiding death. The apple at (9,2) is closest overall (distance 4 from current). Moving RIGHT gets me closer to it (distance 3 from (8,4)). Also (9,1) is nearby.\n\nThe enemy is long (18 segments) and occupies much of the left and center. The right side has more open space and apples. Moving RIGHT seems prudent to access the apples at (9,2) and (9,1) while avoiding the enemy's territory.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (8,4), I can consider moving DOWN to (8,3) then further down toward (8,0) apple, or RIGHT to (9,4) then down toward (9,2) and (9,1). The enemy is currently at (6,3) and likely to move UP to (6,4) or RIGHT to (7,3). Either way, staying on the right side keeps distance.\n\n**Final decision:** RIGHT is safe, avoids head-on collision, moves toward closest apples, and maintains reasonable future mobility.\n\nRIGHT",

UP (to 6, 5):**\n    *   Collision with S1 body segment (6, 5).\n    *   H1 moved R, so S1 body segments are now (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), ... (6, 5) is segment 4 of S1's new body. It will not move.\n    *   **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\n**2. DOWN (to 6, 3):**\n    *   Collision with own neck (6, 3). Moving backwards.\n    *   **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\n**3. LEFT (to 5, 4):**\n    *   Collision with own body segment (5, 4).\n    *   My body is: [(6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), ...]. (5, 4) is segment 3. It will not vacate.\n    *   **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\n**4. RIGHT (to 7, 4):**\n    *   (7, 4) is now the neck of S1. S1's new body is [(7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), ... (8, 9)].\n    *   This segment (7, 4) will be vacated *if* S1 does not eat an apple this turn. S1 did *not* eat an apple last turn (length 12 -> length 12).\n    *   S1 Head (8, 4) is moving, the S1 body shifts. The segment at (7, 4) will shift to (7, 5), and (7, 5) shifts to (6, 5), etc., and the tail (8, 9) moves up or out of the board.\n    *   Wait, the body list for S1 is: `(7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), ...`.\n    *   If H1 (8, 4) moves, say, UP to (8, 5):\n        *   New H1: (8, 5)\n        *   New S1 body starts at (8, 4) (where H1 was).\n    *   Therefore, (7, 4) will be the second segment of the S1 body after H1 moves. It will NOT be vacated. Collision.\n    *   **DANGER (Eliminate)**.\n\n**Re-evaluating Body Movement:**\nWhen a snake of length *L* moves and does *not* eat, the head moves to $H'$, and the tail $T$ is popped. The cell $T$ occupied is now empty. All other $L-2$ body segments shift one position.\n\nMy snake (L=19): Tail was (6, 0). My head moved (6, 3) to (6, 4). My body shifted. The list given for T=57 is: `[(6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0)]`. The last segment listed, (6, 0), is the cell that was vacated by the previous tail (which was likely at (5, 0) or (5, 1) based on the T=56 rationale which listed (6, 0) as existing body then). *The current body list IS the body for Turn 57 (after the move on Turn 56).* The actual tail that is about to be popped off is (6, 0).\n\nS1 Body (L=12): Head (8, 4), Body: `[(7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9)]`.\n(7, 4) is S1's neck. If H1 moves, (7, 4) will become the new head's neck. It is **not** vacated.\n\n**Conclusion:** All four directions result in immediate death for H0. This indicates an error in the safety evaluation or the provided coordinates imply H0 is trapped.\n\nLet's carefully re-examine the current state of H0 (6, 4) and its neighbors:\n\n1.  **UP (6, 5):** Occupied by S1 body `(6, 5)`. **DEAD.**\n2.  **DOWN (6, 3):** Occupied by S0 neck/body `(6, 3)`. **DEAD.**\n3.  **LEFT (5, 4):** Occupied by S0 body `(5, 4)`. **DEAD.**\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 4):** Occupied by S1 body `(7, 4)`. **DEAD.**\n\nH0 is at (6, 4). It is surrounded by:\n*   (6, 5) T1\n*   (6, 3) T0\n*   (5, 4) T0\n*   (7, 4) T1\n\nThis is a complete self-entrapment or a fatal position resulting from the last move.\n\n*(Self-Correction/Rethink)*: In standard Snake, if you move, say, RIGHT from (X, Y) to (X+1, Y), then (X, Y) becomes the new neck. If you move back LEFT to (X, Y) the next turn, you hit your neck. The *only* safe self-collision space is the tail, which is guaranteed to move.\n\nLet's check if the tail (6, 0) position helps S0.\nThe snake body list is ordered head-to-tail.\nS0 body: `[(6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0)]`\n\nNone of the surrounding segments (6, 3), (5, 4) is the tail (6, 0). Therefore, these cells will remain occupied by S0's shifting body.\n\nH0 has no legal move. The game ends in death for Snake 0 this turn.\n\nHowever, the problem requires me to choose one of the four directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). If all moves are fatal, the game rules state:\n> If all snakes die on the same turn for any reason, the game ends immediately and the snake with more apples at that moment wins; if apples are tied, the game is a draw.\n\nSince I have 18 apples and S1 has 11, if I die alone, I lose. If S1 dies too, I win. But S1 seems safe.\n\nIf all four directions lead to my death, I must select one direction, leading to Game Over for Snake 0. Since the game requires a move, I will analyze which death is the \"least wrong\" or if there is a fundamental rule exception I missed (e.g., collision tolerance in multi-snake games, which is explicitly denied by the rules).\n\nGiven the strict rules:\n*   (6, 5) T1\n*   (6, 3) T0 (Neck)\n*   (5, 4) T0\n*   (7, 4) T1 (Neck of T1)\n\nS0 is indeed trapped and dies this turn. Since I must output a move, I will choose a direction that has zero chance of a mutual collision, just in case S1 makes a bizarre move that lands in my death cell, but that's grasping at straws. S1 is entirely safe at (8, 4).\n\nS1 options from (8, 4), neck (7, 4):\n1. UP (8, 5): Safe. Good path towards A3 (3, 9) by controlling the top edge.\n2. DOWN (8, 3): Targets A4 (8, 0).\n3. LEFT (7, 4): Hits neck (7, 4). Dead.\n4. RIGHT (9, 4): Collision with wall (X=9 is the max X). Wait, (9, 4) is a valid coordinate. It's empty.\n\nS1 likely moves UP (8, 5) or RIGHT (9, 4) to pursue A2/A1, or DOWN (8, 3) to pursue A4.\n\nIf I move **UP (6, 5)**: I hit T1.\nIf I move **DOWN (6, 3)**: I hit T0 (Neck).\nIf I move **LEFT (5, 4)**: I hit T0.\nIf I move **RIGHT (7, 4)**: I hit T1 (Neck).\n\nI will choose **RIGHT** (7, 4), as it's a collision with an enemy body part, which, while fatal, usually doesn't involve the most egregious rules violation (like moving directly back into neck) or wall collision.\n\nThis is a losing situation due to entrapment by the previous move's geometry.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, my body ends at (8,9) tail, but (8,5) is empty according to board? Let's check: My body segments are: (7,4), (7,5), (6,5), (6,6), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (8,9). (8,5) is not in my body. Board shows column 8 row 5 is '.' Actually row 5 column 8 is '.' Yes, (8,5) is empty. But need to check enemy body: Enemy body doesn't include (8,5). So UP to (8,5) appears safe. \u2705\n- **DOWN** to (8,3): Check board - (8,3) is empty '.' No enemy body there. \u2705 **SAFE**\n- **LEFT** to (7,4): This is my neck (first body segment after head). \u274c **UNSAFE** (would hit myself)\n- **RIGHT** to (9,4): Check board boundaries: x=9 is within 0-9, y=4. Board shows (9,4) is '.' empty. No enemy body there. \u2705 **SAFE**\n\nSo three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy snake #0 possible moves from (6,4):**\n- UP to (6,5): Occupied by my body at (6,5) \u274c\n- DOWN to (6,3): Occupied by enemy's own body (first segment after head at (6,3)) \u274c\n- LEFT to (5,4): Occupied by enemy's own body (segment at (5,4)) \u274c\n- RIGHT to (7,4): Occupied by my body at (7,4) \u274c\n\nWait, enemy has NO safe moves? That can't be right. Let's re-examine: Enemy head at (6,4). Its body: [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), ...]. So:\n- UP (6,5): My body at (6,5) \u2192 occupied\n- DOWN (6,3): Enemy's own body at (6,3) \u2192 occupied\n- LEFT (5,4): Enemy's own body at (5,4) \u2192 occupied\n- RIGHT (7,4): My body at (7,4) \u2192 occupied\n\nIndeed, enemy is completely trapped! Unless I'm missing something about board coordinates. According to the board display, at row 4 (y=4), column 6 is '0' (enemy head), column 7 is 'T' (my body at (7,4)), column 5 is 'T' (enemy body at (5,4)), column 6 row 5 is 'T' (my body at (6,5)), column 6 row 3 is 'T' (enemy body at (6,3)). Yes, enemy has no safe moves. That means enemy snake #0 will die this turn regardless of what move it chooses.\n\n**This is crucial:** If enemy dies this turn, and I survive, I immediately win since all opponents are dead. So my primary goal is to survive this turn.\n\n**Head-on collision risk:** Since enemy has no safe moves, any move it makes will kill it. But I should still avoid moving into cells enemy might choose (though they're all occupied). Actually, if enemy chooses a move into occupied cell, it dies immediately. But if I move into that same cell, would we both die? Let's check:\n- If enemy moves UP to (6,5) (my body) and I move UP to (8,5): no collision.\n- If enemy moves RIGHT to (7,4) (my body) and I move DOWN to (8,3): no collision.\n- If enemy moves LEFT/DOWN into its own body: I'm not going there anyway.\n\nSo no head-on collision risk with enemy's possible moves since I can't reach those cells from (8,4) in one move anyway.\n\n**Apple distances from (8,4):**\n- (9,1): |8-9| + |4-1| = 1+3=4\n- (9,2): |8-9| + |4-2| = 1+2=3\n- (3,9): |8-3| + |4-9| = 5+5=10\n- (8,0): |8-8| + |4-0| = 0+4=4\n- (4,1): |8-4| + |4-1| = 4+3=7\n\nClosest apples: (9,2) distance 3, (9,1) and (8,0) distance 4.\n\n**Future mobility from potential positions:**\n- **UP to (8,5)**: Then possible moves: UP(8,6)-empty, DOWN(8,4)-my old head but will be empty after I move, LEFT(7,5)-my body \u274c, RIGHT(9,5)-empty. So 3 safe moves next turn.\n- **DOWN to (8,3)**: Then possible moves: UP(8,4)-empty, DOWN(8,2)-empty, LEFT(7,3)-empty, RIGHT(9,3)-empty. All 4 directions safe! Excellent mobility.\n- **RIGHT to (9,4)**: Then possible moves: UP(9,5)-empty, DOWN(9,3)-empty, LEFT(8,4)-empty, RIGHT would be off board \u274c. So 3 safe moves.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\nSince enemy is trapped and will die this turn, I just need to survive. All three moves are safe for me. DOWN to (8,3) gives the best future mobility (4 options next turn). It also moves me toward apple at (8,0) (distance reduces from 4 to 3 from (8,3)). UP moves toward (9,2) but less directly. RIGHT moves directly toward (9,2) but limits future right moves.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:** With enemy dead after this turn, I'll be the only snake left. I should focus on safely collecting apples while avoiding trapping myself. The apples at (9,1), (9,2), (8,0) are closest. My body is quite long (12 segments including head), so I need to be careful not to box myself in. The right side of the board has more open space. I should work my way down toward (8,0) and (9,1)/(9,2) while keeping escape routes open.\n\n**Final decision:** DOWN gives maximum mobility, moves toward apple (8,0), and keeps me safe. With enemy guaranteed to die, I just need to survive this turn and then I win.\n\nDOWN",
