While not directly towards them, it keeps the path open.\n   - Moving down from (9, 9) gives me more flexibility for the next turn (I can move left, down, or right from (9, 8)).\n\n2. **Move LEFT to (8, 9):**\n   - This is also a safe move.\n   - It moves me towards the right edge, closer to the apples at (8, 2) and (8, 3).\n   - From (8, 9), the next move could be left (towards the apple at (7, 0)) or down (towards apples at (8, 2) and (8, 3)).\n\n### Comparing the Two Safe Moves\n\n- Moving **DOWN** to (9, 8) seems slightly more conservative and keeps more options open.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (8, 9) is more directional, heading toward the cluster of apples on the right side of the board.\n\nHowever, the snake at (3, 1) is far away and unlikely to be a concern for this turn. The priority is to start moving toward apples and expanding my options.\n\n### Strategic Plan\n\nMy head is at the top-right corner. There are two apples to my immediate left at (8, 2) and (8, 3). The best initial move is to move **LEFT**, which starts me on a path toward those apples and begins to centralize my position, making future apple collection more efficient.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nI will move **LEFT** to (8, 9) to begin moving toward the nearby apples.\n\nLEFT",

Wait\u2014rule says moving directly backwards into your own body counts as hitting yourself. But with no body, the \"backwards\" move (LEFT) is onto an empty cell, so it's allowed.

No imminent walls or loops opportunity here.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turns:** Continue RIGHT along y=2: (6,2) this move, then (7,2), reach x=8 by ~turn 6.

Its possible moves (UP to (7,8), DOWN to (7,6), LEFT to (6,7), RIGHT to (8,7)) are possible, but none target my safe moves' destinations (e.g., no shared cells like (7,4) vs. (7,6)). No immediate head-on risk this turn, and no body collision threat since I won't move into its path and it has no body. However, staying in x=7 risks pursuit if it descends in that column.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nAmong these, LEFT takes me to (6,3) in open mid-board area with ample escapes (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT from (6,3) or nearby), dodging the enemy's exact x=7 column early while angling northwest toward clustered left apples (e.g., (1,4) at y=4/x=1). DOWN to (7,2) goes straight for the immediate apple at (7,0) (two turns down), but positions me lower at y=2 post-move, closer to board edge and my own tail at (8,2), potentially narrowing options if enemy pursues vertically or if I grow and need to loop up without space. UP to (7,4) keeps an \"up and right\" path (e.g., via (8,4) or beyond toward apples like (5,8) at y=8/x=5), but remains in x=7, risking direct encroachment if enemy drops down (it could reach y=6 in one more move, forcing defensive veers).\n\nBest: LEFT\u2014follows the planned early dodge, opens flexible northwest pursuit with distance from enemy (moves farther from x=7), and avoids committing to low-y edge risks or overhanging the enemy too long.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turns:** From (6,3), either LEFT to (5,3) or UP to (6,4) for another dodge/angle adjustment, aiming northwest to x=4-2 range then up to (1,4) in the open mid-left quadrant (keep y around 4-5 to chain to (1,8)/(0,7) after eating). Watch x=7 for enemy descent\u2014 if it moves DOWN to (7,6), accelerate LEFT to (5,3) and up to y=5+ for escape, or loop prematurely in x=5-7 if needed to avoid collision; maintain 2-3 exits ahead. If enemy shifts east (e.g., RIGHT to (8,7) or beyond), shift rightward myself via UP/RIGHT from (6,3) toward (7,4) and then (8,4)-(5,8) scan before it clears the area. Prioritize eating (1,4) soon for early growth lead, reset dodge if enemy advances aggressively in x=6-8, and avoid y<2 unless an apple drops there and path is clear.\n\nLEFT",

All these are currently high and distant; no immediate threat to my safe moves this turn. If enemy descends in x=7 or shifts left to x=6, it could approach later, potentially blocking westward paths toward low-x apples ((1,4), (1,8), (0,7)). Prioritizing LEFT to (2,3) continues momentum toward x=1 apples without closing options: from (2,3), another LEFT to (1,3) gets closer, UP to (2,4) opens toward (1,4), DOWN to (2,2) allows south evasion if needed (board opens down to y=0-2). UP to (3,4) would keep x stable but move farther from low-x targets, while DOWN might crowd the bottom prematurely near the distant (7,0) apple. Avoid UP or DOWN initially to prioritize the clustered low-x apples; LEFT maximizes progress westward while retaining follow-up flexibility (at least three safe directions post-move).\n\nNext plan for future turns: After this LEFT to (2,3), aim for another LEFT to (1,3) to approach x=1. From (1,3), prioritize UP to (1,4) to eat the apple, grow, and continue NORTH toward (1,8) if available\u2014or adjust SOUTH at (1,3) to (1,2) if enemy threatens (e.g., if it descends and shifts left). Watch enemy position post-move; if it stays high or goes right, push for more apples like (0,7) via west then north. Fallback: If low-x apples are threatened or eaten, loop BACK to higher x for (5,8) at y=8, starting with RIGHT and UP from (1,3) or later.

No body.\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 1):** Head at (3, 3), body at (4, 3) and (5, 3).\n- **Apples:** Located at (7, 0), (1, 8), (0, 7), (1, 4), (5, 8).\n- **Board Size:** 10x10 (coordinates from 0,0 to 9,9).\n\n**Objective:**\n- Stay alive.\n- Collect apples.\n- Avoid collisions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Identify Immediate Moves and Safety\n\n**Possible Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**My Head Position:** (7, 9) \u2014 top edge of the board.\n\n**Evaluating Each Move:**\n\n- **UP:** From (7, 9) to (7, 10) \u2192 Invalid (off the board). **Death.**\n- **DOWN:** From (7, 9) to (7, 8) \u2192 Valid. Safe.\n- **LEFT:** From (7, 9) to (6, 9) \u2192 Valid. Safe.\n- **RIGHT:** From (7, 9) to (8, 9) \u2192 Valid. Safe.\n\n**Eliminated Move:** UP (off the board).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Check for Collisions with Snakes\n\n**My Snake:** No body. Only head at (7, 9). No self-collision possible.\n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n- Head: (3, 3)\n- Body: (4, 3), (5, 3)\n\nNone of the potential moves (DOWN to (7,8), LEFT to (6,9), RIGHT to (8,9)) place my head on an enemy's body or head.\n\n\u2705 **All remaining moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are collision-free.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Proximity to Apples\n\n**Current Apple Positions:**\n1. (7, 0) \u2014 Far below.\n2. (1, 8) \u2014 On the same row as my head (y=9), far to the left.\n3. (0, 7) \u2014 Below and to the left.\n4. (1, 4) \u2014 Below and to the left.\n5. (5, 8) \u2014 One row below, two columns to the left.\n\n**My head is at (7, 9).**\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each move for future apple access:\n\n- **DOWN to (7, 8):** Aligns with apple at (7, 0) \u2014 direct vertical path. This move maintains access to that apple and is **strategically strong**.\n- **LEFT to (6, 9):** Moves away from the apple at (7, 0). Still aligns with apples at (5, 8), (1, 8), etc., but not as directly.\n- **RIGHT to (8, 9):** Moves further away from all apples and toward an edge. Risky for future access.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Consider Enemy Movement\n\nEnemy snake head is at (3, 3). Tail is at (5, 3). It\u2019s currently horizontal.\n\nPossible moves for enemy: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (assuming not reverse into body).\n\nIf enemy moves:\n- UP to (3, 4)\n- DOWN to (3, 2)\n- LEFT to (2, 3)\n- RIGHT to (4, 3) \u2014 blocked by own body. Invalid.\n\nSo it will likely stay put or move up/down/left. It\u2019s far away (distance: 4 rows, 4 columns). **Not an immediate threat.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Choose Best Safe Move\n\nAmong safe moves:\n- **DOWN (7, 8):** Keeps me in direct line with apple (7, 0). Keeps future moves open (can move DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT next).\n- **LEFT (6, 9):** Also safe. Potential access to other apples.\n- **RIGHT (8, 9):** Safe but moves toward edge, reducing options.\n\n**Preferred Move:** DOWN \u2014 safest, maintains apple path, and keeps options open for next turns.\n\n---\n\n### Long-Term Plan (for my future self):\n\n**Plan:** Move straight down toward apple (7, 0). Once I move to (7, 8), I will likely continue DOWN next turn to (7, 7), keeping aligned with the apple. Enemy is far away for now, so not a concern, but monitor its moves.\n\nDOWN",

No immediate conflict with enemy (they're distant at (5,8) with no blocking moves), and keeps the board open without crowding walls or reducing future moves. (0,7) is an alternate nearby apple via LEFT first, but this path scores closer or equal to (0,7) in move count, avoids potential minor snake crowding near x=0, and aligns with prior strategy.\n- LEFT to (0,4): Empty, on-board, no collision. Positions closer to (0,7) apple (direct vertical path of 3 UP moves from here, matching the UP path above). Also maintains 3 safe egress (UP to (0,5), DOWN to (0,3), RIGHT to (1,4)-now body after move, but safe for current turn). Similar safety and apple proximity as UP, but UP feels more aligned with the northward y=8 cluster focus from last rationale, preventing divided attention; plus, LEFT edges closer to western wall (x=0 line) sooner, subtly narrowing long-term width if enemy approaches inland.\n- RIGHT to (2,4): Empty, on-board, no collision initially. But locks in 2 future safe moves already (UP to (2,5); RIGHT to (3,4); DOWN to (2,3)-own body suicide; LEFT to (1,4)-own body suicide), crowding options early versus 3 for UP/LEFT. Pivots eastward without clear apple gain (distances (6,3) by a couple moves but overall net worse), and could box self against eastern wall later. Avoid to preserve flexibility.\n- DOWN to (1,3): Directly into own body (next segment), immediate death\u2014eliminated.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Rating: UP > LEFT > RIGHT (UP keeps y-progression intact, opens widest path; LEFT is strong but narrower; RIGHT poorest). Enemy (length 2) from (5,8) can safely move UP/DOWN/LEFT; if they retreat LEFT or DOWN, they might loop back; if UP, they near row 9 edge. No shared apple on (1,8) or (0,7)\u2014they're distant\u2014so no head-on pressure yet. Prioritize UP for secure growth trajectory; if (1,8) gets challenged later, can pivot LEFT from (1,5) to (0,5) toward (0,7) fallback. Watch for enemy descending (e.g., DOWN then LEFT/DOWN) to flank; if they stall, maintain length lead.\n\nUP",
