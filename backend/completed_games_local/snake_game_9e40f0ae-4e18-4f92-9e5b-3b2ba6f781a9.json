UP leads directly into Snake #0's head at (3,0)? No, but let's check: Snake #0's head is at (3,0), body at (3,1). (7,1) is empty and not adjacent to Snake #0, but UP to (7,1) is open. However, moving UP from (7,0) to (7,1) is valid and doesn't immediately hit anything. But let's re-examine: Snake #0's body is at (3,1), not blocking (7,1). However, my last move was LEFT from (8,0) to (7,0), and now I'm at (7,0). But per the board, (8,0) is empty now, since I moved. \n\nBut per the board:\nRow 1: . A . T . . . . . A\nCol 0: (1,0) is '.', (1,1) is 'A', (1,2) is '.', (1,3) is 'T', etc.\nBut the coordinate mapping is:\nRow 0 is y=0, row 1 is y=1, ..., row 9 is y=9.\nColumn x=0 to x=9.\n\nSo (7,0) is row 1, col 7 (since y=0 is row 0). But the board is shown as:\nRow 0: 0 . . A 0 . A . 1 . .\nBut the formatting is a bit ambiguous. Let's parse the board as given:\n\nLine 0 (y=0):  . . A 0 . A . 1 . .\nSo x=0: '.', x=1: '.', x=2: 'A', x=3: '0', x=4: '.', x=5: 'A', x=6: '.', x=7: '1', x=8: '.', x=9: '.'\n\nBut the legend says: \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\" So the first line is y=0 (bottom), last is y=9 (top).\n\nYour head is at (7,0), so x=7, y=0. From the bottom row (y=0): x=7 is the '1' in the string above. But the legend says \"T\" is your head, so on the board it's marked as 'T' at (1,3) for x=3, y=1? Wait, let's look at row 1 (y=1):\n\nRow 1 (y=1): . A . T . . . . . A\nSo x=0: '.', x=1: 'A', x=2: '.', x=3: 'T', x=4: '.', x=5: '.', x=6: '.', x=7: '.', x=8: '.', x=9: 'A'\n\nSo (x=7, y=1) is '.'; (x=3, y=1) is 'T' (your previous head?), but your current head is (7,0), which is on row 0, x=7: from row 0: x=7 is '1' (from the string: \"...A . 1 . .\"), but that's probably a formatting error.\n\nBut the explicit coordinates are given, so we can ignore the board grid and just use the coordinate lists.\n\nSo from (7,0), possible moves:\n- UP: (7,1) -- is this occupied? Snake #0's body is at (3,1), not (7,1). No other snake head at (7,1). So it's open.\n- DOWN: off board (y would be -1)\n- LEFT: (6,0) -- open\n- RIGHT: (8,0) -- but previously you were at (8,0), now it's empty since you moved.\n\nBut the main threat is Snake #0 at (3,0), with body at (3,1). If you move UP to (7,1), you are not adjacent to Snake #0's head or body, so it's safe. But moving LEFT to (6,0) is also safe.\n\nHowever, if you move UP to (7,1), Snake #0 could move and possibly block you later, but for now, both moves are safe.\n\nBut let's consider long-term: moving LEFT keeps you along the bottom row, where there are apples at (5,0) and (2,0), and more space to maneuver. Moving UP puts you in a row with fewer immediate apples and closer to enemy territory.\n\nAlso, since you have no body, you can't die from hitting yourself by moving backwards.\n\nTherefore, safest and most flexible is LEFT, keeping you on the bottom row with more escape options and closer to apples at (5,0) and (2,0).\n\nLong-term plan: Stay on the bottom row, collect apples at (5,0) and (2,0) if possible, avoid the center where Snake #0 is, and only move up when necessary and safe.\n\nLEFT",

If that happens, I need to pivot to other apples like (5, 3) or (4, 4), both at distance 5-6 from my current position.\n\nUP to (1, 2) gives me the most flexibility with 3 safe follow-up moves, avoids potential head-on collisions with the enemy, and puts me in a good position to hunt for other apples.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (1, 2), then navigate toward apples in the upper portion of the board while avoiding the enemy.\n\nUP",

Wait\u2014let me re-examine: head is (3,6), body is (3,5). So UP would be (4,6), DOWN is (2,6), LEFT is (3,5) which is my body (forbidden), RIGHT is (4,6). But UP and RIGHT both go to (4,6)? No: UP is (x, y+1): (3,7). DOWN is (3,5) but that's my body. LEFT is (2,6). RIGHT is (4,6). So the legal moves are UP (3,7), LEFT (2,6), RIGHT (4,6).\n\nLet me clarify:\n- Head: (3,6)\n- Body: [(3,5)]\n\nSo possible moves:\n- UP: (3,7)\n- DOWN: (3,5) \u2192 body, invalid\n- LEFT: (2,6)\n- RIGHT: (4,6)\n\nCheck each:\n- (3,7): empty, not occupied by any snake, not off board.\n- (2,6): empty, not occupied.\n- (4,6): empty, not occupied.\n\nNow, analyze each:\n\n**UP to (3,7):**\n- Moves me closer to upper apples (e.g., (6,9), (8,9), (7,8), (5,8)).\n- Keeps me away from Snake #0, whose head is at (1,8) and body at (1,7), (1,6), (1,5).\n- Opens up access to the upper half of the board.\n- Less risk of immediate collision with Snake #0.\n\n**LEFT to (2,6):**\n- Moves left toward Snake #0\u2019s body at (1,6). Risk of collision if Snake #0 moves right or down.\n- Less access to apples on the right side of the board.\n\n**RIGHT to (4,6):**\n- Keeps me centered, but doesn\u2019t move closer to any particular apple.\n- Still a safe move, but doesn\u2019t advance my long-term plan of controlling the upper-right quadrant.\n\nLong-term plan: Stay alive, avoid Snake #0, and position myself to reach upper-right apples. UP is the safest and most advantageous option, as it opens up more space and keeps me away from the enemy cluster.\n\nTherefore, I choose UP.\n\nUP\n\n**Long-term plan:** Continue moving upward, aiming for the apples at (6,9), (7,8), and (8,9), while maintaining distance from Snake #0. Stay flexible and avoid tight corridors. Prioritize safety and future options above short-term apple grabs unless a safe opportunity presents itself.",

Not my body (body at y=5,6,7). Not enemy body. SAFE.\n- DOWN to (1, 7): This is my first body segment (neck). NOT SAFE.\n- LEFT to (0, 8): On board. Not my body. Not enemy body. SAFE.\n- RIGHT to (2, 8): On board. Not my body. Not enemy body. SAFE.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFollow-up options analysis:\n- From (1, 9) after UP: Only 3 safe follow-ups (can't go UP - off edge). Edge position limits options.\n- From (0, 8) after LEFT: 3 safe follow-ups (can't go LEFT - off edge). Edge position.\n- From (2, 8) after RIGHT: 4 safe follow-ups (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all available). Best flexibility.\n\nApple proximity considerations:\n- Closest apples: (5, 8) at distance 4, (4, 7) at distance 4\n- UP to (1, 9): Distance to (5, 8) becomes 5, (4, 7) becomes 5. Moving away from apples.\n- LEFT to (0, 8): Distance to (5, 8) becomes 5, (4, 7) becomes 5. Moving away from apples.\n- RIGHT to (2, 8): Distance to (5, 8) becomes 3, (4, 7) becomes 3. Moving toward apples!\n\nEnemy collision risk analysis:\n- Enemy from (3, 6) could go UP to (3, 7), LEFT to (2, 6), or RIGHT to (4, 6)\n- If I go RIGHT to (2, 8) and enemy goes UP to (3, 7), we'd be at (2, 8) and (3, 7) respectively - distance 2 (diagonal)\n- Next turn, I must be careful not to go RIGHT to (3, 8) if enemy goes UP to (3, 8) from (3, 7) - that would be a head-on collision\n- From (2, 8), I have other safe options: UP to (2, 9), DOWN to (2, 7), or LEFT back to (1, 8)\n\nRIGHT to (2, 8) provides the best balance of:\n- 4 follow-up options for maximum flexibility\n- Getting closer to the apple cluster at (5, 8), (4, 7), (6, 7)\n- Avoiding edge constraints of UP and LEFT moves\n- Safe position with room to maneuver\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to (2, 8), then continue toward the apple cluster while monitoring enemy movement. Next turn, I'll avoid going to (3, 8) if enemy is at (3, 7) to prevent potential head-on collision.\n\nRIGHT",
