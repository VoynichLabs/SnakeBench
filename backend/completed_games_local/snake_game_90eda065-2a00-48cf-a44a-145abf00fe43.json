While safe now, it reduces future options since I'll be against the wall. No apples are nearby on the left.\n- **RIGHT to (2, 0):** Moves me toward the center of the board, keeping more options open. There's an apple at (5, 1) which is in this general direction.\n- **UP to (1, 1):** Also keeps me in the center, heading toward apples at (5, 1) and (5, 4). This also keeps all future options open.\n\nComparing RIGHT and UP, both are good. However, UP positions me better for a longer route toward multiple apples, as I'll be aligned vertically with apples at y=1 and y=4.\n\nMy long-term strategy should be to move upward to gain access to the central apples, particularly (5, 1) and (5, 4), while avoiding the enemy snake at (3, 4). Staying mobile and avoiding walls is key in the early game.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Move upward to get into open space and position myself to approach the apples at y=1 and y=4.

RIGHT leads away, increasing distance to both (e.g., to (5,1) now 4+ moves). Prioritize apple proximity.\n\nDOWN risks: Enemy could contest (5,1) by going RIGHT x3 (also 3 moves). If both arrive simultaneously (turn 5), head-on collision\u2014both die, but I win 1-0 apples. If enemy ignores (e.g., takes easier (1,0) in 2 moves for 1-0 tie), I eat uncontested for 2-1 lead. Paths don't cross earlier; enemy can't block column 5 low in <3 moves. Win-win: either immediate win or lead.\n\nUP risks: Uncontested (enemy 9 moves away), gets me to 2 apples by turn 5.

Going DOWN to get it is safe and beneficial.\n\nThe enemy is at (5, 3) and could potentially move toward (5, 1) or (5, 7), so heading toward (5, 1) might be risky if we both try to go there.\n\n### Step 4: Avoiding head-on collisions and constriction\n\nThe enemy is longer than me (it has a body segment), and is moving this turn too. I don't know its move, but moving DOWN to the apple is away from it and safe.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nGoing DOWN to (1, 0) to get the nearby apple is the best move:\n- Safe.\n- Gains a point.\n- Keeps future moves open (though I'll have to avoid going UP next turn into my own neck).\n- Moves away from the enemy.\n\nShort-term plan: Collect the apple at (1, 0) and then consider moving RIGHT or UP next turn to head toward apples at (5, 1) or (3, 9)/(4, 9) while avoiding getting trapped in any bottom corner or near the enemy snake.\n\nDOWN",

No, it's within (0-9, 0-9).\n     - Is (3, 4) part of my body? No, my body is at (2, 3).\n     - Is (3, 4) part of the enemy snake? No.\n     - Is it moving backwards into my own body? No, as my body is to the left, not above.\n   - Strategic value:\n     - This move takes me further from the nearest apples, but it's a safe open space.\n     - It keeps future options open (can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT from (3, 4) next turn).\n\n2. **Move DOWN to (3, 2):**\n   - Next cell: (3, 2)\n   - Safety check:\n     - Is (3, 2) out of bounds? No.\n     - Is (3, 2) part of my body? No.\n     - Is (3, 2) part of the enemy snake? No.\n     - Is it moving backwards? No.\n   - Strategic value:\n     - This is also a safe move into open space.\n     - It takes me away from apples and closer to the bottom edge, limiting future space.\n\n3. **Move LEFT to (2, 3):**\n   - Next cell: (2, 3)\n   - Safety check:\n     - Is (2, 3) out of bounds? No.\n     - Is (2, 3) part of my body? Yes. This is my own body segment.\n     - **This move is immediately fatal. Eliminate LEFT.**\n\n4. **Move RIGHT to (4, 3):**\n   - Next cell: (4, 3)\n   - Safety check:\n     - Is (4, 3) out of bounds? No.\n     - Is (4, 3) part of my body? No.\n     - Is (4, 3) part of the enemy snake? No.\n     - Is it moving backwards? No.\n   - Strategic value:\n     - This is a safe move into open space.\n     - It aligns me horizontally with apples at (3, 9) and (4, 9), though they are far away.\n     - It keeps future options open.\n\n---\n\n### Decision Making\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nLet's compare them:\n\n- **DOWN** moves me toward the edge of the board, which is generally risky as it reduces future options.\n- **UP** moves me toward the center of the board, which is good for options, but farther from apples.\n- **RIGHT** moves me horizontally toward the cluster of apples at (3, 9) and (4, 9), even though they are still 6 rows away. It also keeps me in the middle of the board vertically.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is at the top and seems focused on the apples there, moving RIGHT to position myself for a long-term path toward those apples while staying in the middle of the board seems like the best strategic choice. It balances safety, option preservation, and a potential path to food.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Move RIGHT to (4, 3) to begin moving toward the upper apples and stay in the center. Next turn, evaluate moving UP or RIGHT again to continue developing a safe path.\n\nRIGHT",

No.  \n     - Is (4, 4) part of my body? No.  \n     - Is (4, 4) part of the enemy snake? No.  \n   - **Strategic value:**  \n     - Moving up keeps me in vertical alignment with the apples at (3, 9) and (4, 9), although the enemy is nearby and poses a serious threat.  \n     - This move builds vertical mobility but increases risk due to proximity to the enemy in future turns.  \n\n2. **Move DOWN to (4, 2):**  \n   - **Safety check:**  \n     - Is (4, 2) out of bounds? No.  \n     - Is (4, 2) part of my body? No.  \n     - Is (4, 2) part of the enemy snake? No.  \n   - **Strategic value:**  \n     - Moves me further away from the enemy and apples, but gives me more open board space to maneuver.  \n     - Safe and defensive.  \n\n3. **Move LEFT to (3, 3):**  \n   - **Safety check:**  \n     - Is (3, 3) part of my body? Yes. This is a fatal collision.  \n   - **Eliminate LEFT.**  \n\n4. **Move RIGHT to (5, 3):**  \n   - **Safety check:**  \n     - Is (5, 3) out of bounds? No.  \n     - Is (5, 3) part of my body? No.  \n     - Is (5, 3) part of the enemy snake? No.  \n   - **Strategic value:**  \n     - This move expands horizontally into open space.  \n     - It increases distance from the dangerous top area and offers better future positioning.  \n     - Slightly preferable over UP because the enemy is coiling near the top, and moving right avoids direct confrontation for now.  \n\n---\n\n### Decision\n\n**Safe moves:** UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n- **UP** risks getting me into a dangerous zone where a collision or trap could be fatal.  \n- **DOWN** is very safe but risk-averse and reduces apple accessibility.  \n- **RIGHT** offers the best balance: safe, avoids enemy territory, and positions me to swing up later or head toward lower apples like (0, 5) or (9, 6) when practical.\n\nLonger-term, I should plan to move vertically once I have more safe space, and prioritize survival over aggressive apple chasing.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Move RIGHT to (5, 3) to open up more safe board space and remain mobile. Re-evaluate next turn based on enemy position and apple movements.\n\nRIGHT",

LEFT superior: progresses northwest apple trifecta ((0,8),(0,6),(0,5)) in ~3 turns, maintains length edge (8 vs. 1), keeps board control open (top row clear for sweeps).

My last move was LEFT, which was likely random due to a rate limit error, moving me from (5, 1) to (4, 1). This is a safe position.\n\nLooking at the board:\n- Enemy snake 0 is long (9 segments) and its head is at (0, 7). It\u2019s likely trying to navigate down or right. Its body stretches from (0, 9) down to (5, 8), so moving right (toward my head at (4, 1)) is possible, but would require it to move up first or avoid conflict.\n- My head is at (4, 1), and I can move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. LEFT would be a direct collision with my own body at (5, 1), so it is not safe.\n\n### Move Safety Check\n\n1. **UP (to (4, 2))**:\n   - Safe. No snake body or head is there.\n   - Keeps options open. I could move towards apples at (0, 2) or (0, 5) later.\n2. **DOWN (to (4, 0))**:\n   - Safe. No snake body or head is there.\n   - Keeps options open. I could move towards apples at (0, 2) later, but it's further away.\n3. **LEFT (to (3, 1))**:\n   - **Unsafe**. Direct collision with my own body segment.\n   - Eliminated.\n4. **RIGHT (to (5, 1))**:\n   - **Unsafe**. Direct collision with my own body segment.\n   - Eliminated.\n\nOnly UP and DOWN are safe.\n\n### Strategic Evaluation (Safe Moves Only)\n\n- **UP**:\n  - Moves me to (4, 2).\n  - Positions me to potentially move toward nearby apples later (e.g., (0, 2), (0, 5), or even (7, 8) if I go far right).\n  - Keeps the open space of the board (center) available for maneuvering.\n- **DOWN**:\n  - Moves me to (4, 0).\n  - Pushes me towards the bottom edge of the board.\n  - Limits future movement options. If I go further down, I get trapped along the bottom. If I turn around, it will take more moves.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nMy snake is currently very short (2 segments), so avoiding getting trapped near walls or enemy snakes is crucial. Moving UP is the better choice as it keeps my options open, moves me slightly closer to potential future apples, and avoids cornering myself.\n\n**Plan for future moves**: Prioritize UP for now to get into open space. Then assess a path to the nearest reachable apple (likely (0, 2) or one of the apples along the left column if I can get there before the enemy snake dominates that region). Avoid getting too close to the enemy snake's head at (0, 7).\n\nUP",

Keeps mobility high.  \n   - Positions for future access to apples like (6, 5) or even (7, 8) if I move right later.  \n   - No risk of immediate confrontation with the enemy snake, which is moving around the top-left area.  \n\n2. **LEFT (to (3, 2))**:  \n   - Moves me slightly left but not toward any immediate apple.  \n   - Keeps me relatively close to (0, 2) and (0, 5), but is not particularly strategic.  \n\n3. **RIGHT (to (5, 2))**:  \n   - Could be a good path toward (6, 5) or (7, 8).  \n   - However, (6, 5) and (7, 8) are also attractive targets for the long enemy snake. Moving right puts me more in open space but also closer to a race for distant apples.  \n\n### Enemy Snake Behavior\nSnake 0 is long (9 segments) and positioned primarily near the top edge moving downward or rightward. Its head is now at (0, 6). It might be prioritizing the apples on the left side: (0, 5), (0, 2).\n\nIts current valid moves:\n- UP: to (0, 7) \u2013 blocked by own body.\n- DOWN: to (0, 5) \u2013 apple.\n- LEFT: to (-1, 6) \u2013 off board.\n- RIGHT: to (1, 6) \u2013 valid, safe.\n\nIt seems highly likely that the enemy will move DOWN to (0, 5) to grab that apple next turn. Therefore, trying to contest the apples on the far left (like (0, 2) or (0, 5)) may not be viable long-term.\n\n### Strategic Pathing\nRather than head directly left to compete for apples with a superior-length snake, it's smarter to grow in a different region: the center or right. Moving UP or RIGHT preserves options. But moving UP makes more sense this turn to maintain safety and stay open.\n\n### Final Decision\nMove **UP** to (4, 3). This places me in open space, safely away from direct conflict or bottlenecks. It sets up a better positioning for mid-board apples and gives flexibility for next turn.\n\n**Plan for future moves**:\n- Next few turns: head UP to (4, 4), (4, 5), then consider moving RIGHT toward (6, 5) or further if needed.\n- Keep an eye on enemy snake\u2019s expansion; avoid paths that box me in.\n- Prioritize center or right-side apples to deconflict with enemy territory.\n\nUP",

UP to (7, 5)**\n- **Safety:**\n  - The cell (7, 5) is empty. It's not out of bounds.\n  - It's not in my body.\n  - It's not in the enemy's body.\n  - It's a safe move.\n- **Future Potential:**\n  - This move puts me directly below the two apples at (7, 8) and (9, 8).\n  - It's a highly strategic position for future growth.\n  - From (7, 5), I have three open directions: UP, LEFT, DOWN. This move keeps my options maximized.\n\n**2. DOWN to (7, 3)**\n- **Safety:**\n  - The cell (7, 3) is empty. It's a safe move.\n- **Future Potential:**\n  - This moves me away from the center and the concentrations of apples.\n  - It leaves me with only two follow-up safe moves (LEFT or UP). It's a slightly less flexible position.\n\n**3. LEFT to (6, 4)**\n- **Safety:**\n  - The cell (6, 4) is occupied by my own body segment [the first part of my tail].\n  - Moving here would cause an immediate collision with my own body.\n- **Conclusion:** This is an illegal move and results in instant death. **Eliminated.**\n\n**4. RIGHT to (8, 4)**\n- **Safety:**\n  - The cell (8, 4) is empty. It's a safe move.\n- **Future Potential:**\n  - This moves me towards the edge of the board.\n  - It puts me closer to the apple at (9, 6), but not as efficiently as moving UP.\n  - From (8, 4), my future safe moves are limited to UP, DOWN, or LEFT (RIGHT would take me to the board edge at (9,4) on the next turn). Less optimal than UP. Moving UP gives better access to the northern apples and more escape routes.\n\n---\n\n### Analyzing Enemy Snake's Potential Moves\n\nThe enemy snake is significantly longer and in a dominant position.\n\n- Its head is at (6, 5).\n- Its body is a long, mostly horizontal line.\n- Its most likely target is the cluster of apples at (7, 8) and (9, 8).\n\n**It will probably move UP to (6, 6) or RIGHT to (7, 5).**\n\nThis is a critical point. If I also move to (7, 5), that would be a head-on collision, resulting in both snakes dying instantly. Since the enemy is much longer and will win in a draw, I must avoid this square.\n\n---\n\n### Re-evaluating My Moves with Enemy Prediction\n\nLet's reassess my safe moves, knowing the enemy might go for (7, 5).\n\n1. **UP to (7, 5):**\n   - **High Risk:** As analyzed, the enemy snake at (6, 5) is very likely to move RIGHT to (7, 5). This would result in a head-on collision. **Eliminated.**\n\n2. **DOWN to (7, 3):**\n   - **Safety:** Still safe.\n   - **Future Potential:** It moves me towards the apple at (3, 3) but places me far from the main apple sources. However, it's a safe retreat from the immediate danger zone near the enemy.\n\n3. **LEFT to (6, 4):**\n   - **Eliminated:** Moves into my body.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 4):**\n   - **Safety:** Still safe.\n   - **Future Potential:** Moves me to the edge, but also allows me to swing wide around the bottom of the enemy snake. From here, I can potentially move UP on the next turn to reposition myself under the apple cluster. This also avoids the direct threat of the enemy's head path. While not the most aggressive towards apples, it's a safe and flexible maneuver that creates separation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision\n\nThe logic has evolved:\n\n- My initial best choice (UP) becomes deadly due to a predicted collision.\n- The next best immediate safe moves are DOWN or RIGHT.\n- **Moving UP is suicidal. Eliminated.**\n- **Moving DOWN** is safe and gets me closer to one apple in the bottom-left. It's a very defensive but valid option.\n- **Moving RIGHT** is also safe. It moves me to the board's edge but takes me out of the direct line of fire from the stronger, longer enemy snake who is moving into the space I would have occupied. It sets me up for a safer, future-oriented path.\n- Given the immediate threat from the enemy and the need to survive, **RIGHT** is the most prudent move. It avoids the collision risk at (7, 5) and prevents getting trapped by the long enemy snake.\n\n**Short Plan for Next Turn:**\nMy last move was RIGHT, placing me at (8, 4). I avoided a potential collision at (7, 5) where the enemy might have gone. The dominant strategy is to survive. From (8, 4), I should assess the new enemy position. My next priority is to move UP towards the open space at (8, 5) and then position myself under the northern apples at (7, 8) or (9, 8), while being mindful of the snake ID 0's head. Keeping the enemy's long body to my left or below me is preferable.\n\nRIGHT",

Assume enemy DOWN (9,3): t33 UP (9,6) eat 12th; t34 UP (9,7); t35 UP (9,8) eat 13th; t36 LEFT (8,8); t37 LEFT (7,8) eat 14th. t38 DOWN (7,7) empty; t39 DOWN (7,6); t40 DOWN (7,5) empty-by-then; head south/west to (3,3) (~t45, row5 clears) or (0,2) if available. Monitor enemy\u2014if pursues east post-eat, intercept at (9,7)/(8,8); if south to (3,3)/(0,2), use length to block/circle. If enemy UP t32, win. Aim 20+ by t50, dominate board.\n\nRIGHT",
