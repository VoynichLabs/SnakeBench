Moving up or down keeps me on empty squares, but they take me away from the nearest reachable apple at (0,\u202f4), which is the closest apple that I can still aim for without a long detour. Moving left steps onto an empty cell (6,\u202f4), brings me one step closer to that apple, and leaves multiple escape routes for the next turn (I could then go up, down, or continue left). No enemy head can reach (6,\u202f4) in a single move, so a head\u2011on collision is impossible this turn. Therefore, the safest and most strategically advantageous move is to go LEFT.  \nLEFT",

This move maximizes both safety and strategic advantage.\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter eating the apple at (2, 5), I'll be at (2, 5) with 7 apples vs enemy's 4. The remaining apples are (9, 2), (2, 9), (8, 1), and (7, 8).

This would be an immediate apple collection\n- Moves me to the top row (y=9)\n- This would put me at 8 apples, extending my lead to 8-5\n- This is the most direct path toward immediate apple collection\n- Gets me to the top edge of the board, which could limit future movement options\n- This is the highest-value immediate move\n\n**LEFT (1, 8) Analysis:**\n- Moves me to (1, 8)\n- Keeps me on the left edge of the board\n- Moves me away from all remaining apples\n- Less strategic value for apple collection\n- Still maintains distance from enemy\n- Reduces options for future movement\n\n**RIGHT (3, 8) Analysis:**\n- Moves me to (3, 8)\n- Moves me toward center of board\n- Brings me closer to apples (4, 7)\n- Increases potential interaction with enemy snake\n- Less direct path to immediately reachable apples\n- Opens up more movement options\n\n**Enemy Movement Considerations:**\nThe enemy at (6, 8) can move to (6, 9), (5, 8), (7, 8), or (6, 7). If the enemy moves to (6, 9), it's moving up. If it moves to (5, 8) or (7, 8), it's moving horizontally. If it moves to (7, 8), it would hit its own body segment - that's not a legal move. The enemy likely won't be able to reach the apple at (8, 4) or (8, 1) immediately.\n\nLooking at the apple positions, the apple at (2, 9) is much closer to me than to the enemy, so I have priority on that one. The apple at (4, 7) is closer to me than to the enemy as well. The apples at (8, 4) and (8, 1) are closer to the enemy.\n\n**DECISION: UP**\n\nUP is the optimal choice. It moves me directly toward the apple at (2, 9), which contains an apple! This is an immediate opportunity to collect another apple, extending my lead to 8-5. This move maximizes my apple collection while maintaining my advantage. The move puts me at the top edge of the board, but the immediate reward outweighs the potential movement limitation.\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter moving to (2, 9) and collecting the apple, I'll be at 8 apples with a 3-apple lead. I should assess the board state to determine the next best apple to pursue. The remaining apples are (9, 2), (8, 1), (8, 4), and (4, 7). I should prioritize the closer apple at (4, 7) while maintaining my lead and avoiding the enemy snake in the right half of the board.\n\nUP",

Both of these moves would put the enemy extremely close to both (4, 7) and (4, 6).\n\nThe apples at (8, 4), (8, 1), and (9, 2) are much farther away from both snakes and less immediate concerns.\n\n**DECISION: LEFT**\n\nLEFT is the optimal choice. While RIGHT would bring me closer to the apples at (4, 7) and (4, 6), the enemy snake is positioned to reach those apples very quickly. Moving RIGHT would put me in direct competition for those apples with the enemy, and the enemy has a positional advantage.\n\nMoving LEFT keeps me away from immediate competition with the enemy and maintains my lead. From (1, 9), I can potentially move toward the left side of the board and look for opportunities to reach the more distant apples (9, 2), (8, 1), or (8, 4) before the enemy can get there. This is a safer move that preserves my advantage while avoiding direct confrontation.\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter moving to (1, 9), I should assess the board state. The enemy will likely head toward (4, 7) or (4, 6). I should move toward the right side of the board to position myself for the apples at (8, 4), (8, 1), and (9, 2), which are farther from the enemy's current position. I need to maintain my 3-apple lead while avoiding direct competition with the enemy for the nearest apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Both of these moves would put the enemy extremely close to both (4, 7) and (4, 6).\n\nThe apples at (8, 4), (8, 1), and (9, 2) are much farther away from both snakes and less immediate concerns.\n\n**DECISION: DOWN**\n\nDOWN is the optimal choice. Moving DOWN to (3, 8) takes me off the top edge and positions me closer to the remaining apples while maintaining competitive distance to both (4, 7) and (4, 6). This move keeps me in the game for apple collection and provides more flexibility for future moves compared to RIGHT, which would keep me on the top edge with limited movement options.\n\nFrom (3, 8), I can potentially move toward the apples at (4, 7) or (4, 6) if the enemy doesn't take them, or reposition myself for the more distant apples (8, 4), (8, 1), and (9, 2). This is a proactive move that maintains my lead while positioning me for potential apple collection.\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter moving to (3, 8), I should assess the board state. The enemy will likely head toward (4, 7) or (4, 6). If the enemy takes (4, 7), I should consider moving toward (4, 6) or repositioning for the more distant apples. If the enemy moves elsewhere, I should consider moving toward (4, 6) or (4, 7) myself. I need to maintain my 3-apple lead while positioning myself to collect more apples before the enemy can reach them.\n\nDOWN",

Would hit enemy \u274c\n\n**CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS**\n\nI'm in a very dangerous position! All four possible moves would result in death:\n\n- UP, DOWN, and LEFT would hit my own body\n- RIGHT would hit the enemy snake's body\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREATS:**\n\n**My Snake's Position:**\n- Head at (3, 8)\n- My body segments occupy: (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (1, 5), (0, 5)\n- I'm positioned in a tight cluster on the left side of the board\n- All adjacent cells to my head are occupied by either my own body or the enemy snake\n\n**Enemy Snake's Position:**\n- Head at (4, 7)\n- Body: [(4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (6, 7)]\n- The enemy is positioned to my right and slightly below me\n- The cell directly to my right (4, 8) is occupied by the enemy's body\n\n**DEATH SCENARIO CONFIRMATION**\n\nThis is a confirmed death scenario. There is no safe move available. This appears to be a result of my previous move DOWN to (3, 8), which has trapped me against my own body with the enemy snake blocking the only remaining exit.\n\n**GAME OUTCOME**\n\nSince all possible moves result in death, I will die on this turn regardless of my choice. The game will end, and the enemy snake will win by default with a score of 6-8 (the enemy has 6 apples, I have 8, but since I'm dead, the enemy wins).\n\nThis is an unfortunate situation resulting from being boxed in by my own body with the enemy snake blocking the escape route.\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:**\nThere is no viable plan since all moves lead to death. This turn will result in my elimination from the game.\n\nRIGHT",
