I am single-segment.\n\n**Movement Considerations:**\n1.  **UP:** Moves to (5, 9). This is valid (within 0-9).\n2.  **DOWN:** Moves to (5, 7). This is valid.\n3.  **LEFT:** Moves to (4, 8). This is valid.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Moves to (6, 8). This is valid.\n\nI need to check for collisions (immediate or potential head-on).\n*   **Opponent:** Snake #1 at (1, 9). They can move UP (die), DOWN (1,8), LEFT (0,9), or RIGHT (2,9).\n    *   If they move **RIGHT** to (2, 9), and I move **LEFT** to (4, 8), no collision.\n    *   If I move **RIGHT** to (6, 8), no collision with opponent.\n*   **Snakes moving into each other:**\n    *   If I move **LEFT** to (4, 8) and they move **RIGHT** to (2, 9), distinct cells.\n    *   If I move **RIGHT** to (6, 8), no conflict.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nThere are two nearby apples: (6, 4) and (5, 4). Both are 4 steps away (via Right/Down or Down/Right).\n*   Current pos: (5, 8).\n*   Target (6, 4): Need to go Right 1, Down 4. Total 5 moves.\n*   Target (5, 4): Need to go Down 4. Total 4 moves.\n\nIf I go **LEFT**, I move away from these apples.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I move toward (5, 4).\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I move toward (6, 4).\n\nAlso, there is an apple at (9, 8). To reach that from (5, 8), I need to go RIGHT 4 times.\n*   If I go **RIGHT** now, I step towards the apple at (9, 8) AND the apple at (6, 4). (6,4) is vertically closer, but (9,8) is a straight line. However, the apples at (5,4) and (6,4) are clustered. Usually, securing a close cluster is safer.\n\nLet's evaluate the paths:\n*   **Path to (5, 4):** DOWN (5,7) -> (5,6) -> (5,5) -> (5,4). This is a straight line. The only obstruction is the board edge. It is safe.\n*   **Path to (6, 4):** RIGHT (6,8) -> (6,7) -> (6,6) -> (6,5) -> (6,4). Also a straight line. Safe.\n\nBoth (5,4) and (6,4) are equally reachable. Moving **DOWN** puts me in line for (5,4). Moving **RIGHT** puts me in line for (6,4) and (9,8).\n\nWait, looking at the board again.\nApple at (6,4) is adjacent to (5,4) and (6,5).\nApple at (5,4) is at x=5.\nI am at (5,8).\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6,8), I am on the path to (6,4).\nIf I go **DOWN** to (5,7), I am on the path to (5,4).\n\nWhich one is better?\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I can potentially grab (6,4) and then (5,4) or (9,8).\nIf I go **DOWN**, I can grab (5,4) and then (6,4).\n\nThere is also an apple at (2, 8). To reach it, I must go LEFT twice.\nIf I go **LEFT** now, I move towards (2,8).\n(2,8) is at x=2.\n(5,8) is at x=5.\nDistance to (2,8) is 3 steps.\nDistance to (5,4) is 4 steps.\nDistance to (6,4) is 5 steps.\n\nHowever, (5,4) and (6,4) are close to each other. Eating one puts me near the other.\n(2,8) is isolated.\n\nLet's check for head-on collisions again.\nOpponent is at (1,9).\nThey can move DOWN to (1,8) or RIGHT to (2,9).\nIf I move **LEFT** to (4,8), I am safe from (1,8) and (2,9).\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (6,8), I am safe.\nIf I move **DOWN** to (5,7), I am safe.\n\nNo immediate collision risks.\n\nLet's look at the **Apple at (9, 8)**.\nI am at (5, 8).\nPath: Right, Right, Right, Right.\nMoving **RIGHT** (to 6,8) is the first step of this path.\nThis also aligns with the path to **Apple at (6, 4)** (Right 1, then Down 4).\nSo, moving **RIGHT** covers the path to (9,8) and (6,4).\nMoving **DOWN** covers the path to (5,4) and (6,4).\n\nIf I move **LEFT**, I go to (4,8). This is the first step to (2,8) (Left, Left).\nIt is also a step away from the (5,4)/(6,4) cluster.\n\nThe (5,4)/(6,4) cluster is denser.\nI should prioritize the cluster.\nTo hit the cluster efficiently, I can go either DOWN or RIGHT.\nIf I go DOWN, I eat (5,4), then I must turn RIGHT to get (6,4).\nIf I go RIGHT, I eat (6,4), then I must turn LEFT to get (5,4).\nThis suggests **RIGHT** and **DOWN** are equivalent for the cluster.\n\nHowever, **RIGHT** is also the start of the path to (9,8).\n**LEFT** is the start of the path to (2,8).\n(9,8) is closer to the right edge.\n(2,8) is closer to the left edge.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nRow 8: \". . A . . 0 . . . A\"\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nI am at 5.\nA at 2 and A at 9.\n\nIf I go **LEFT**, I go to 4.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I go to 6.\n\nThere are no other snakes immediately threatening these spots.\nThe opponent is at (1,9).\nIf opponent moves **DOWN** to (1,8), and I move **LEFT** to (4,8), we are 3 spaces apart.\nIf opponent moves **RIGHT** to (2,9), and I move **LEFT** to (4,8), we are safe.\n\nIf opponent moves **DOWN** to (1,8), and I move **RIGHT** to (6,8), we are 5 spaces apart.\n\nLet's assume the opponent wants apples too.\nApples at (2,8) and (9,8).\n(2,8) is very close to the opponent at (1,9). Distance: |1-2| + |9-8| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n(9,8) is far.\nThe opponent is likely to go for (2,8).\nIf opponent goes for (2,8), they might move RIGHT to (2,9) or DOWN to (1,8).\nIf they move **RIGHT** to (2,9), they are closer to the apple.\nIf they move **DOWN** to (1,8), they are closer.\n\nIf the opponent goes for (2,8), and I go **LEFT**, I am contesting that apple? No, I am at (4,8). The apple is at (2,8). The opponent is at (1,9).\nOpponent -> (2,9) -> (2,8).\nI -> (4,8) -> (3,8) -> (2,8).\nWe would collide at (2,8) if we race.\nHowever, the opponent is closer. They can get to (2,8) in 2 turns (R, D). I need 3 turns (L, L, D).\nIt is likely the opponent will get (2,8) before me.\nTherefore, I should not go **LEFT**. I should go for the other apples.\n\nThe other apples are (5,4), (6,4), (9,8).\n(5,4) and (6,4) are a cluster.\n(9,8) is isolated.\n\nIf I go **DOWN** (to 5,7), I am on the path to (5,4).\nIf I go **RIGHT** (to 6,7), I am on the path to (6,4) and (9,8).\n\nLet's consider the \"keep future options open\" rule.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I am at (5,7).\nNext turn, I can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I am at (6,8).\nNext turn, I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\nFrom (6,8), I can go DOWN to (6,7) [towards (6,4)] or LEFT to (5,8) [back to start] or RIGHT to (7,8) [towards (9,8)].\nFrom (5,7), I can go DOWN to (5,6) [towards (5,4)].\n\nThe (5,4)/(6,4) cluster is very attractive.\nLet's decide between **DOWN** and **RIGHT**.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I secure the x=5 column. The apple is at (5,4).\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I secure x=6. The apple is at (6,4).\n\nIs there any reason to prefer one over the other?\n(5,4) and (6,4) are very close. Once I eat one, I can easily get the other.\nLet's look at the board surrounding (5,4) and (6,4).\nRow 4: \"...AA...\"\n(5,4) and (6,4) are both apples.\nI can eat one, then immediately turn to the other.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I go (5,7)->(5,6)->(5,5)->(5,4). Eat. Now I'm at (5,4). Next move I can go RIGHT to (6,4). Eat. Good.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I go (6,8)->(6,7)->(6,6)->(6,5)->(6,4). Eat. Now I'm at (6,4). Next move I can go LEFT to (5,4). Eat. Good.\n\nBoth strategies work.\nHowever, the opponent is at (1,9).\nIf the opponent wants apples, the closest apple to them is (2,8).\nIf the opponent eats (2,8), they might grow.\nI should eat something.\n(5,4) and (6,4) are 4-5 steps away.\n(9,8) is 4 steps away (if I go right).\n(2,8) is 3 steps away (if I go left), but contested.\n\nLet's look at the \"Turn 0\" state. Usually, in turn 0, you want to establish a direction.\nGoing **LEFT** is risky because of the opponent's proximity to (2,8).\nGoing **DOWN** or **RIGHT** are safer.\n\nIs there any danger in going **RIGHT**?\nAt (6,8), I am clear.\nAt (5,7), I am clear.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I am at (5,7).\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I am at (6,8).\n\nLet's look at the apple at (3, 0).\nIt's far bottom left.\nThe apple at (5,4) is much closer.\n\nLet's refine the choice between **DOWN** and **RIGHT**.\nIs there any difference in board geometry?\nRow 8: \". . A . . 0 . . . A\"\nRow 7: \". . . . . . . . . .\"\nRow 6: \". . . . . . . . . .\"\nRow 5: \". . . . . . . . . .\"\nRow 4: \". . . . . A A . . .\"\n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (5,7), I am entering the column 5.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6,8), I am entering column 6.\n\nLet's assume the opponent is rational.\nOpponent at (1,9).\nClosest apple: (2,8).\nOpponent likely moves **RIGHT** to (2,9) or **DOWN** to (1,8).\nIf opponent moves **RIGHT** to (2,9), they are setting up for (2,8).\nIf opponent moves **DOWN** to (1,8), they are also setting up.\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (4,8), I am moving towards the contested (2,8). This is bad.\nIf I move **DOWN** or **RIGHT**, I am moving away from the opponent and the contested apple.\n\nBetween **DOWN** and **RIGHT**:\n(5,4) and (6,4) are a pair.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I am one step closer to (9,8) as well (in case the cluster becomes dangerous).\nIf I go **DOWN**, I am moving towards the \"bottom\" of the board.\n\nThe apple at (5,4) has the same X coordinate as my current X (5).\nThe apple at (6,4) has X=6.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I maintain the X=5 line.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I switch to X=6.\n\nLet's check the coordinate range (0-9).\nNo issues.\n\nOne specific check on **RIGHT**:\nMove to (6,8).\nIs there any snake at (6,8)? No.\nAny snake moving there? Opponent is at (1,9). Max move is 1 unit.\nSo (6,8) is safe.\n\nOne specific check on **DOWN**:\nMove to (5,7).\nSafe.\n\nWhich one offers better \"future options\"?\nIf I am at (5,7), I can go DOWN (to 5,6), LEFT (to 4,7), RIGHT (to 6,7).\nIf I am at (6,8), I can go DOWN (to 6,7), LEFT (to 5,8), RIGHT (to 7,8), UP (to 6,9).\n(6,8) has slightly more neighbors, but (5,7) is central.\nThe critical factor is the apples.\n(5,4) and (6,4) are both reachable.\nThe apple at (9,8) is also reachable.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I have two paths: Down to (6,4) cluster, or Right to (9,8).\nIf I go **DOWN**, I have one path: Down to (5,4), then Right to (6,4).\nThe **RIGHT** move seems to offer more flexibility (can go for (9,8) if (6,4) is blocked later, though currently not blocked).\nAlso, moving **RIGHT** puts me at (6,8), which is exactly the X coordinate of one of the apples (6,4). This aligns me perfectly with the target.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (9,8).\nIt is on the same row (y=8).\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I stay on row 8.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I leave row 8.\nStaying on row 8 keeps the option for (9,8) open longer.\nMoving DOWN commits to the bottom apples.\nSince the bottom apples (5,4, 6,4) are close, staying on row 8 for a bit to check for safety or potential other apples (though none are listed nearby) is fine.\nActually, the apples are listed. No others.\nSo, go for the apples.\n(9,8) is 4 steps away.\n(6,4) is 5 steps away (1 Right, 4 Down).\n(5,4) is 4 steps away (4 Down).\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I am at (6,8). Distance to (6,4) is 4 (Down). Distance to (9,8) is 3 (Right).\nIf I go **DOWN**, I am at (5,7). Distance to (5,4) is 3 (Down). Distance to (6,4) is 4 (1 Right, 3 Down).\n\nThe distances are roughly similar.\nHowever, (6,8) is a \"fresh\" cell (has an apple at same row, far right). (5,7) is just empty space.\nAlso, (6,4) is a shared cluster. If I go **RIGHT**, I enter the column (x=6) of that cluster.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I am still at x=5.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nRow 8: \"...A..0...A\"\nIf I go **LEFT**, I move towards (2,8).\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I move towards (9,8).\nIf I go **DOWN**, I move towards (5,4).\n\nThe opponent is at (1,9).\nThe opponent is likely to go for (2,8).\nIf opponent goes for (2,8), they will likely be on the left side.\nThis makes the right side (including x=6, x=9) safer from the opponent.\nTherefore, going **RIGHT** or **DOWN** is safer than **LEFT**.\nBetween **RIGHT** and **DOWN**:\nGoing **RIGHT** moves me to the right side of the board (x=6, potentially x=9).\nGoing **DOWN** keeps me in the middle (x=5).\nSince the opponent is on the left, moving to the right side might be spatially advantageous to avoid the opponent in the long run (if the opponent moves left/right).\nAlso, the apple at (9,8) is far right.\nThe apple at (6,4) is at x=6.\nThe apple at (5,4) is at x=5.\nIf I go **RIGHT** (to 6,8), I am committed to the right side.\nIf I go **DOWN** (to 5,7), I am in the middle.\n\nLet's assume the opponent moves to (2,8) or (1,8).\nIf I am at (6,8), I am far away.\nIf I am at (5,7), I am closer but still distant.\n\nLet's calculate the moves exactly.\nTarget: (6,4).\nPath from (5,8): R, D, D, D, D.\nPath from (5,8): D, R, D, D, D.\nThe first path (RIGHT first) aligns me with the X coordinate of the target immediately.\nThe second path (DOWN first) keeps me at X=5, then I have to jump to X=6.\n\nAlso, the apple at (9,8) is \"free\" if I go right.\nIf I go RIGHT, I can eat (9,8) on the way to (6,4)? No, (9,8) is to the right, (6,4) is down.\nBut if I finish (6,4), I can go back up for (9,8).\nOr if I go for (9,8) first? (9,8) is closer?\nFrom (5,8):\nTo (9,8): 4 Right.\nTo (6,4): 1 Right, 4 Down.\nTo (5,4): 4 Down.\n(5,4) is the closest (4 moves).\n(6,4) is 5 moves.\n(9,8) is 4 moves.\n\nSo (5,4) and (9,8) are tied for closest.\n(5,4) is a cluster.\n(9,8) is isolated.\nCluster is usually better (sustainability).\nIf I go **DOWN**, I secure (5,4).\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I secure (9,8) and (6,4).\nWait, if I go **RIGHT**, I am at (6,8).\nFrom (6,8):\nTo (9,8): 3 Right.\nTo (6,4): 4 Down.\nSo from (6,8), (9,8) is closer than (6,4).\nFrom (5,7):\nTo (5,4): 3 Down.\nTo (6,4): 1 Right, 2 Down (total 3).\nSo from (5,7), (5,4) and (6,4) are equally close.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** -> I will likely grab (9,8) -> then go DOWN for (6,4).\nIf I go **DOWN** -> I will grab (5,4) -> then go RIGHT for (6,4).\n\nThe distance from (6,8) to (9,8) is 3.\nThe distance from (5,7) to (5,4) is 3.\nThen from (9,8) to (6,4) is 3 Right, 4 Down? No.\n(9,8) to (6,4): 3 Left, 4 Down.\nFrom (5,4) to (6,4): 1 Right.\nSo the path DOWN->(5,4)->(6,4) seems more efficient for the cluster.\nThe path RIGHT->(9,8)->(6,4) is scattered.\n\nHowever, the prompt asks to \"keep future options open\".\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I can still go DOWN later and get (6,4).\nIf I go **DOWN**, I can still go RIGHT and get (6,4).\nThe difference is whether I touch (9,8) or (5,4) first.\n(5,4) is safer (it's in the middle of the cluster).\n(9,8) is on the edge.\n\nLet's reconsider the opponent.\nOpponent at (1,9).\nClosest apple: (2,8) distance 2.\nSecond closest: (3,0) or (5,4) distance...\nDistance from (1,9) to (3,0) is |1-3| + |9-0| = 11.\nDistance from (1,9) to (5,4) is |1-5| + |9-4| = 4 + 5 = 9.\nWait, (5,4) is at x=5, y=4.\nOpponent is at x=1, y=9.\n(5,4) is quite far (Manhattan 9).\n(6,4) is 10.\n(2,8) is 2.\n(9,8) is 8 (if they go right).\n(3,0) is 11.\nSo the opponent is extremely likely to go for (2,8).\n\nIf the opponent goes for (2,8), they will move to (2,9) or (1,8).\nIf they move to (2,9), they block the upper row from the left.\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (6,8), I am on the right side.\nIf I move **DOWN** to (5,7), I am in the middle.\nIf I move **LEFT** to (4,8), I am approaching the opponent.\n\nIf the opponent moves to (1,8) (DOWN), they are moving into the \"arena\".\nIf I move **LEFT**, I get closer to collision.\nIf I move **RIGHT** or **DOWN**, I am distancing.\n\nIs there any risk of head-on collision?\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (6,8).\nOpponent moves **RIGHT** to (2,9).\nDistinct.\nOpponent moves **DOWN** to (1,8).\nDistinct.\nIf I move **DOWN** to (5,7).\nOpponent moves **RIGHT** to (2,9).\nDistinct.\nOpponent moves **DOWN** to (1,8).\nDistinct.\nIf I move **LEFT** to (4,8).\nOpponent moves **RIGHT** to (2,9).\nOpponent moves **DOWN** to (1,8).\nIf opponent moves **DOWN** to (1,8), and I move **LEFT** to (4,8), distinct.\nIf opponent moves **RIGHT** to (2,9), and I move **LEFT** to (4,8), distinct.\nSo strictly speaking, **LEFT** is not an immediate death.\n\nHowever, **LEFT** puts me on the same row (y=8) as the opponent's target (2,8).\nIf I go to (4,8), and opponent goes to (2,9), I might be able to race to (2,8) in the future?\nOpponent: (2,9) -> (2,8).\nMe: (4,8) -> (3,8) -> (2,8).\nOpponent wins the race by 1 turn.\nThis suggests I should not compete for (2,8).\n\nSo, I should avoid **LEFT**.\nRemaining: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n**UP**: (5,9). Valid.\n**DOWN**: (5,7).\n**RIGHT**: (6,8).\n**UP** moves to (5,9).\nOpponent at (1,9).\nDistance 4.\nIf opponent moves RIGHT, stays on 1 or 2.\nIf opponent moves DOWN, goes to 1,8.\nSo (5,9) is safe from immediate collision.\nBut is it useful?\nApples are at (5,4) (down), (6,4) (down/right), (9,8) (down/left from 9,9? No, right from 5,9? 5,9 -> 9,8 is 4 right, 1 down). (2,8) is left.\nSo from (5,9), I can go LEFT to (2,8) (contested) or DOWN to (5,4) (safe) or RIGHT to (9,8) (safe).\n(5,9) is close to (5,4).\nDistance (5,9) to (5,4) is 5.\nMy current (5,8) to (5,4) is 4.\nSo **UP** is strictly worse than **DOWN** for reaching (5,4).\n**UP** is the same distance to (9,8) as **RIGHT**?\nFrom (5,9): (9,8) is 4 Right, 1 Down.\nFrom (5,8): (9,8) is 4 Right.\nSo **RIGHT** is better for (9,8).\n**DOWN** is better for (5,4).\n**RIGHT** is better for (6,4) (1 R, 4 D) vs **DOWN** (1 R, 3 D from 5,7).\nWait, from (5,8):\nTo (6,4): R, D, D, D, D (5 moves).\nFrom (5,7):\nTo (6,4): R, D, D, D (4 moves).\nFrom (6,8):\nTo (6,4): D, D, D, D (4 moves).\nSo **DOWN** and **RIGHT** are equally efficient for (6,4) and (5,4) combined?\nLet's check the \"Two Step\" strategy.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I am at (5,7).\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I am at (6,8).\nFrom (5,7), I can go DOWN to (5,6) or RIGHT to (6,7).\nFrom (6,8), I can go DOWN to (6,7) or RIGHT to (7,8).\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 4: \". . . . . A A . . .\"\nThe two apples at (5,4) and (6,4) are adjacent.\nThis is a \"pair\".\nUsually, you want to eat the pair efficiently.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I head to (5,4). Eat. Then I can easily go RIGHT to (6,4).\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I head to (6,4). Eat. Then I can easily go LEFT to (5,4).\nBoth are good.\n\nHowever, the board is 10x10.\nThere is an apple at (3, 0) at the bottom left.\nThere is an apple at (9, 8) at the top right.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I am moving towards the bottom half.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I am moving towards the right half.\n\nThe opponent is at (1, 9) (Top Left).\nIf the opponent goes for (2, 8), they are in the top left.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I go to the top right.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I go to the middle/bottom.\nSpatially, if the opponent is top-left, being bottom-right or right-middle is good.\n\nLet's look at the \"Future Options\" constraint.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I am at (5,7).\nFrom (5,7), I can go DOWN (5,6) -> (5,5) -> (5,4).\nOr RIGHT (6,7) -> (6,6) -> (6,5) -> (6,4).\nBoth are open.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I am at (6,8).\nFrom (6,8), I can go DOWN (6,7) -> (6,6) -> (6,5) -> (6,4).\nOr LEFT (5,8) -> ... back to start?\nOr RIGHT (7,8) -> (8,8) -> (9,8).\nSo **RIGHT** offers the option of (9,8).\n**DOWN** does not offer a quick path to (9,8) (would have to go all the way up later).\n\nIs (9,8) worth it?\n(9,8) is 4 steps away from start.\n(5,4) is 4 steps away.\n(6,4) is 5 steps away.\n(9,8) is isolated.\n(5,4) and (6,4) are a pair.\nUsually, a pair is better than an isolated apple because eating one puts you right next to the other.\nSo the pair (5,4)/(6,4) is the primary target.\nIf the pair is the target, does it matter if I go DOWN or RIGHT?\nIf I go DOWN, I am closer to the \"left\" apple (5,4).\nIf I go RIGHT, I am closer to the \"right\" apple (6,4).\nSince they are adjacent, this difference is minimal.\n\nHowever, consider the coordinate (9,8).\nIt is at y=8.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I leave y=8.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I stay at y=8 for one step.\nStaying at y=8 keeps the option for (9,8) open.\nIf I go DOWN, I have to climb back up to y=8 later to get (9,8).\nClimbing back up costs moves.\nSo, **RIGHT** preserves the option to easily grab (9,8) later.\n**DOWN** commits to the bottom cluster.\n\nIs there a downside to **RIGHT**?\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6,8), is it safe?\nYes.\nIs there a downside to **DOWN**?\nIf I go **DOWN** to (5,7), is it safe?\nYes.\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\n(3, 0), (9, 8), (6, 4), (2, 8), (5, 4).\nThe opponent is at (1, 9).\nThe opponent will likely go for (2, 8).\nIf the opponent gets (2, 8), they will be at (2, 8).\nIf I am at (6, 8), distance is 4.\nIf I am at (5, 7), distance is |5-2| + |7-8| = 3 + 1 = 4.\nSimilar.\n\nLet's assume the opponent moves to (2, 9) (Right).\nThen to (2, 8) (Down).\nI will be at (6, 8) or (5, 7).\nI am safe.\n\nLet's assume the opponent moves to (1, 8) (Down).\nThen to (1, 7) or (2, 8).\nI am safe.\n\nLet's think about the start of the game.\nUsually, you want to establish a direction.\n**RIGHT** is a solid direction. It points to (9,8) and the (6,4) cluster.\n**DOWN** is a solid direction. It points to the (5,4) cluster.\n**LEFT** is bad (opponent conflict).\n**UP** is useless (dead end).\n\nBetween **RIGHT** and **DOWN**:\nThe (6,4) apple is at x=6.\nThe (5,4) apple is at x=5.\nIf I go **RIGHT**, I am at x=6. I am perfectly aligned to eat (6,4) by going straight down.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I am at x=5. I am perfectly aligned to eat (5,4) by going straight down.\nThis symmetry is broken by (9,8).\n(9,8) is at x=9, y=8.\nFrom (6,8), (9,8) is 3 Right.\nFrom (5,7), (9,8) is 4 Right, 1 Up.\nGoing **RIGHT** makes (9,8) much easier to reach.\nGoing **DOWN** makes (9,8) much harder.\n\nSo, **RIGHT** is strictly better for (9,8).\n**RIGHT** and **DOWN** are equivalent for the cluster (5,4)/(6,4).\nTherefore, **RIGHT** is the better move.\n\nFinal check:\nMove: **RIGHT** to (6, 8).\nIs (6, 8) empty? Yes.\nIs any snake moving to (6, 8)?\nOpponent at (1, 9). Max distance 1. No.\nIs it off board? No.\nIs it into my own body? No body.\n\nOne more check on the \"Backwards\" rule.\nI have no body. So I cannot move backwards into my body.\nIf I move **LEFT**, I move to (4, 8).\nIf I later turn around and move **RIGHT**, I would go back to (5, 8).\n(5, 8) is not currently in my body (no body).\nSo even if I had a body, (5, 8) is currently my head. My body is empty.\nSo backwards is not an issue now.\n\nDecision: **RIGHT**.\n\nLong-term plan:\nHead to the right side. Grab the apple at (9, 8) or the cluster at (6, 4)/(5, 4). Maintain distance from the opponent on the left.\n\nMove: RIGHT.\n\nThe board contains an apple at (9,8) on the same row as my current position, and a cluster of apples at (6,4) and (5,4) in the lower middle. The opponent is at (1,9), likely targeting the apple at (2,8). Moving **LEFT** would move me towards the contested apple and the opponent, which is risky. Moving **DOWN** would move me away from the apple at (9,8), making it harder to reach later. Moving **RIGHT** aligns me with the apple at (9,8) and sets a path towards the apple at (6,4), effectively covering two distinct targets while moving away from the opponent. This preserves future options and maximizes safety.\n\nRIGHT",

The other apples ((3, 0), (9, 8), (5, 4), (6, 4)) are much farther away from them. This implies the opponent will remain in the left quadrant of the board.

My current position is (6, 8).\n    *   If I move **DOWN** to (6, 7), I am perfectly aligned vertically with the apple at (6, 4).

If the cluster gets blocked (unlikely), I can easily loop back to (9, 8) later.\n*   **Safety:**\n    *   Opponent is far away (Left side).\n    *   Moving **DOWN** to (6, 7) puts me in an empty column.\n    *   Moving **LEFT** to (5, 8) brings me back towards the opponent's potential future expansion, though not immediately dangerous.\n    *   Moving **UP** is a dead end (wall at y=9).\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** moves away from the cluster (6,4) which is closer to my X=6 than (9,8).\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **DOWN** is the optimal choice.

This is the most direct path towards the apples at (6, 4) and (5, 4). It reduces the distance to the target and maintains a clear path.\n- **LEFT:** Moves to (5, 6). This moves me left, but the apples at (5, 4) and (6, 4) are 2 units down. Moving left or right now would require moving down later anyway. Staying in the column (6,6) -> (6,5) -> (6,4) is the most efficient line to reach the apple at (6,4).\n- **RIGHT:** Moves to (7, 6). This moves me away from the apples.\n\n**Strategy:**\nMy goal is to collect the apples in the cluster at (6,4) and (5,4). The immediate priority is to get to (6,4). The move **DOWN** aligns me perfectly with that apple. I must also watch out for the enemy snake at (2,7). It moved DOWN last turn, and based on its tail marker 'T' at (2,8), it is growing. It poses no immediate threat to my position at (6,6).\n\nTherefore, **DOWN** is the safest and most efficient move.\n\nDOWN",

This matches my body part.\n    *   So moving **UP** to (5, 5) is empty space on the board.\n    *   Is it occupied by my body?\n        *   My body is `[(6, 4), (6, 5)]`.\n        *   (5, 5) is not in that list.\n    *   Is it occupied by enemy?\n        *   Snake #1 is at (3, 5) and body [(3, 6), (3, 7)].

UP, DOWN, and LEFT are safe.\n\n**Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n*   **UP (5, 5):** Keeps me aligned with potential future moves. I can go to (6, 5) (if I wait for my tail to move) or (4, 5) or (5, 6). (5, 6) is near the board edge but open.\n*   **LEFT (4, 4):** Moves me towards the left side of the board. This opens up paths to (3, 4), (2, 4), etc. It also puts me closer to the apple at (3, 0) if I decide to go down later, or the apple at (4, 8) if I go up.\n*   **DOWN (5, 3):** Moves me down towards the bottom of the board. This is useful for the apple at (3, 0) and potentially (5, 0) if it were an apple (it's empty).\n\n**Strategy Consideration:**\n*   I need to avoid getting trapped.\n*   The map is open.\n*   My body is currently vertical at x=6. If I move LEFT, my body becomes a hook shape: Head (4, 4) -> Body1 (5, 4) -> Body2 (6, 4) -> Tail (6, 5).\n*   If I move UP, my body becomes: Head (5, 5) -> Body1 (5, 4) -> Body2 (6, 4).\n*   If I move DOWN, my body becomes: Head (5, 3) -> Body1 (5, 4) -> Body2 (6, 4).\n\n**Apple Scouting:**\n*   (3, 0): Bottom left.\n*   (5, 9): Top middle.\n*   (4, 8): Top left.\n*   (9, 8), (9, 9): Top right.\n\nI need to choose a direction that keeps options open.\n*   Moving **LEFT** to (4, 4) seems like a strong move. It reduces the x-coordinate. The left side of the board (x=0-3) seems relatively empty and has an apple at (3, 0).\n*   Moving **UP** to (5, 5) seems okay, but it puts me closer to the top wall (y=9). However, there are apples there too.\n*   Moving **DOWN** to (5, 3) seems okay to target the apple at (3, 0), but I'm currently at (5, 4). To get to (3, 0), I need to go Left and Down. If I go DOWN now to (5, 3), I still need to go LEFT.\n\nLet's look at the enemy snake #1 at (3, 5).\n*   It can move UP to (3, 6), DOWN to (3, 4), LEFT to (2, 5), or RIGHT to (4, 5).\n*   If I move UP to (5, 5), the distance between me and snake #1 is large.\n*   If I move LEFT to (4, 4), the distance is large.\n*   If I move DOWN to (5, 3), the distance is large.\n\nAll three moves seem safe in terms of collision this turn. I should prioritize moves that give me the most future flexibility (longest path).\n*   The board is 10x10.\n*   Moving **LEFT** into the void on the left side seems like it gives me access to a large area.\n*   Moving **UP** takes me closer to the top wall, but there are apples there, so it's a high-value area.\n*   Moving **DOWN** takes me closer to the bottom wall.\n\nLet's consider the snake's potential path.\nIf I move **LEFT**:\nHead becomes (4, 4).\nBody becomes [(5, 4), (6, 4)].\nThis leaves (6, 5) open as the tail moves away.\nNext turn, I can go to (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 5).\nThis looks good.\n\nIf I move **UP**:\nHead becomes (5, 5).\nBody becomes [(5, 4), (6, 4)].\nNext turn, I can go to (5, 6), (4, 5), (6, 5).\n(6, 5) is currently my body, but by the next turn, the tail (6, 5) will have moved, so (6, 5) will be free.\nThis also looks good.\n\nIf I move **DOWN**:\nHead becomes (5, 3).\nBody becomes [(5, 4), (6, 4)].\nNext turn, I can go to (5, 2), (4, 3), (6, 3).\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\n*   (3, 0): Down-Left.\n*   (4, 8): Up-Left.\n*   (5, 9): Up.\n\nCurrent head: (5, 4).\nDistance to (3, 0) = |5-3| + |4-0| = 2 + 4 = 6.\nDistance to (4, 8) = |5-4| + |4-8| = 1 + 4 = 5.\nDistance to (5, 9) = |5-5| + |4-9| = 0 + 5 = 5.\n\nThe closest apples are (4, 8) and (5, 9). Both are UP.\nWait, (4, 8) is Left and Up.\n(5, 9) is straight Up.\n\nMoving **UP** gets me closer to both (5, 9) and (4, 8).\nMoving **LEFT** gets me closer to (4, 8) but further from (5, 9).\nMoving **DOWN** moves me away from (4, 8) and (5, 9), closer to (3, 0).\n\nSince (5, 9) and (4, 8) are closer, moving UP seems advantageous to target them.\nAlso, moving UP puts me at (5, 5). From there, I can access (4, 5), (6, 5), (5, 6).\nMoving LEFT puts me at (4, 4). From there, I can access (3, 4), (5, 4), (4, 3).\n\nLet's check the board state for row 5 again. `. . . 1 . . T . . .`\nThere is a body part at (6, 5). If I move UP to (5, 5), I am adjacent to the enemy at (3, 5)? No, (3, 5) is on the same row but far away.\nIf I move UP, the enemy at (3, 5) can move RIGHT to (4, 5). I would be at (5, 5). That's safe (distance 1).\nIf the enemy moves UP to (3, 6), I'm safe.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (3, 4), I'm safe.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (2, 5), I'm safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 4):\nThe enemy at (3, 5) can move RIGHT to (4, 5). I am at (4, 4). That's safe (adjacent).\nThe enemy can move DOWN to (3, 4). I am at (4, 4). That's safe.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 3):\nThe enemy at (3, 5) is far.\n\nAll moves are safe regarding the enemy this turn.\n\nLet's look at the \"T\" at (6, 5). This is my tail. It will move next turn.\nIf I move UP to (5, 5):\nMy head is at (5, 5).\nMy body will be (5, 4) and (6, 4).\nThe tail (6, 5) will disappear.\nNext turn, I can go to (6, 5) if I want.\nThis path is clear.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 4):\nMy head is at (4, 4).\nMy body will be (5, 4) and (6, 4).\nNext turn, I can go to (4, 5), (4, 3), (3, 4), or (5, 4) (backwards, death).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 3):\nMy head is at (5, 3).\nMy body will be (5, 4) and (6, 4).\nNext turn, I can go to (5, 2), (5, 4) (death), (4, 3), (6, 3).\n\nI want to go towards apples. The closest apples are UP.\nSo, I should probably go UP.\nHowever, going LEFT positions me well for the left side apples too.\nLet's consider the board size. 10x10.\nGoing UP moves me from y=4 to y=5. I have 4 steps to the top wall.\nGoing LEFT moves me from x=5 to x=4. I have 4 steps to the left wall.\nGoing DOWN moves me to y=3. I have 3 steps to the bottom wall.\n\nGoing UP seems like the most direct path to the nearest apples (4,8) and (5,9).\nLet's verify the map.\nRow 8 has an apple at (4, 8).\nRow 9 has apples at (5, 9) and (9, 9).\nGoing UP gets me closer to these.\n\nIs there any trap?\nIf I go UP to (5, 5):\nI am in row 5. The board row 5 is `. . . 1 . . T . . .`.\nThe enemy is at (3, 5).\nMy position is (5, 5).\nThe body part is at (6, 5).\nIf I go UP again to (5, 6):\nRow 6 is `. . . T . . . . . .`.\nBody part at (3, 6)? No, the description said Snake #1 body is [(3, 6), (3, 7)].\nWait, the board shows `T` at (3, 6) and (3, 7).\nSo Row 6: `. . . T . . . . . .`.\nSo at (5, 6), the board is empty.\nIf I go to (5, 6), I can continue to (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9).\nRow 8 has an apple at (4, 8).\nRow 9 has an apple at (5, 9).\nSo going UP is a clear path to high-value targets.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 4):\nNext I can go to (4, 5).\nRow 5 is clear at (4, 5).\nThen (4, 6).\nRow 6 is clear at (4, 6).\nThen (4, 7).\nRow 7 is clear at (4, 7).\nThen (4, 8) - Apple.\nSo LEFT also leads to an apple at (4, 8).\n\nGoing UP leads to (5, 9). Going LEFT leads to (4, 8).\nDistance to (5, 9) from (5, 5) is 4 steps.\nDistance to (4, 8) from (4, 4) is 4 steps.\nFrom current (5, 4):\nTo (5, 9): 5 steps.\nTo (4, 8): 1 (LEFT) + 4 (UP) = 5 steps.\nTie.\n\nHowever, if I go UP now to (5, 5), I can potentially pivot to (4, 5) next turn to head to (4, 8) if (5, 9) is blocked or I want to change targets.\nIf I go LEFT now to (4, 4), I am committed to the left side more.\nIf I go UP to (5, 5), I am in the middle, open to go left or right or up.\n\nThe board is open. I have space.\nLet's look at the enemy again.\nSnake #1 is at (3, 5).\nIf I go UP to (5, 5), I am far.\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 4), I am getting closer.\nBut the enemy is likely chasing the apple at (4, 8) or (5, 9) as well.\nThe apple at (3, 0) is far for the enemy (y=5 to 0).\nThe apple at (9, 8) is far for the enemy.\nThe enemy is probably going UP or LEFT/RIGHT.\n\nLet's assume the enemy goes UP to (3, 6).\nI am at (5, 5).\nWe are safe.\n\nIf I go LEFT:\nThe enemy goes UP to (3, 6). I am at (4, 4). Safe.\nThe enemy goes RIGHT to (4, 5). I am at (4, 4). Safe.\n\nIf I go UP:\nThe enemy goes UP to (3, 6). I am at (5, 5). Safe.\nThe enemy goes RIGHT to (4, 5). I am at (5, 5). Safe.\n\nI will choose **UP**. It seems like a balanced move that keeps me on the path to the cluster of apples at the top while maintaining flexibility.\n\nWait, let me re-read the \"My last move information\".\n\"My snake head is at (6, 4).\"\nWait, the description for this turn says:\n\"Your snake (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (5, 4)\n  - Body: [(6, 4), (6, 5)]\"\n\nThere is a contradiction in the prompt.\nThe \"My last move information\" says \"My snake head is at (6, 4)\".\nThe \"Your snake (ID: 0)\" block says \"Head: (5, 4)\".\nThe board state shows `0` at `(5, 4)` (row 4, index 5).\n\nLet's look at the board state carefully again.\nRow 4: `. . . . . 0 T . . .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nSo `0` is at index 5. Coordinate (5, 4).\nThe `T` is at index 6. Coordinate (6, 4).\n\nSo the \"Your snake (ID: 0)\" block and the board state agree that the head is at (5, 4).\nThe \"My last move information\" says \"My snake head is at (6, 4)\".\nThe \"My last move information\" also says \"LEFT\" was the last move.\nIf the head was at (6, 4) and I moved LEFT, the head would go to (5, 4).\nThis explains the discrepancy!\nThe \"My last move information\" is describing the state *before* the last move, or it's slightly lagging in text, but the result is clear: I am at (5, 4).\nThe body is [(6, 4), (6, 5)].\nSo, I am indeed at (5, 4).\n\nSo, the analysis above (Head at 5,4) is correct.\n\nLet's double check the moves from (5, 4).\nHead: (5, 4)\nBody: [(6, 4), (6, 5)]\n\n1.  **UP (5, 5):** Empty on board. Not in body list. Safe.\n2.  **DOWN (5, 3):** Empty on board. Not in body list. Safe.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 4):** Empty on board. Not in body list. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 4):** Contains `T` on board. Is in body list `[(6, 4), ...]`. Unsafe.\n\nSo we are safe to move UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\nI prefer UP because it heads towards the apples at (5, 9) and (4, 8).\nLet's check the apple locations relative to (5, 4).\n(5, 9): Up 5.\n(4, 8): Up 4, Left 1.\n(3, 0): Down 4, Left 2.\n(9, 8): Right 4, Up 4.\n(9, 9): Right 4, Up 5.\n\nTargeting (5, 9) is a straight shot if I go UP.\nIf I go UP to (5, 5):\nNext moves: (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (5, 9).\nThis seems the most efficient.\nHowever, I must be wary of the enemy snake #1 at (3, 5).\nIf I go UP to (5, 5), I am in row 5.\nSnake #1 is at (3, 5). It is in the same row.\nIf Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (4, 5), it is one cell away.\nIf it moves RIGHT again next turn to (5, 5), I might be there... no, I'm moving up.\nWait, if I am at (5, 5) and Snake #1 is at (4, 5), I am safe.\nIf Snake #1 is at (5, 5) and I am at (5, 6), we collide? No, simultaneous move.\nIf Snake #1 moves to (4, 5) and I move to (5, 5), we are adjacent.\nIf Snake #1 moves to (5, 5) and I move to (5, 5), we die.\n\nIs it possible Snake #1 goes for (5, 9)?\nIt's at (3, 5).\nIt can go (3, 6), (4, 5), etc.\nTo get to (5, 9), it needs to go (3, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (5, 7) -> (5, 8) -> (5, 9).\nOr (4, 5) -> (4, 6) ...\nI am at (5, 4). If I go (5, 5) -> (5, 6)...\nWe might race for (5, 9).\nBut I am closer to (5, 9) in terms of Y distance (5 vs 4 for it? No, it's at y=5, I am at y=4. It's at y=5, I am at y=4. I am 5 steps away, it is 4 steps away? No.\nSnake #1 at (3, 5). (5, 9) is (5, 9).\nDistance: |3-5| + |5-9| = 2 + 4 = 6.\nMe at (5, 4). (5, 9) is (5, 9).\nDistance: |5-5| + |4-9| = 0 + 5 = 5.\nI am closer by 1 step. I have the advantage if we race straight.\nHowever, I need to be careful not to run into it.\nIf I go UP, I increase my Y. It might increase its Y.\nWe might end up on a collision course or getting too close.\n\nLet's consider **LEFT (4, 4)**.\nIf I go LEFT:\nI go to (4, 4).\nI can then go UP to (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (4, 8) - Apple.\nSnake #1 at (3, 5). Distance to (4, 8) = |3-4| + |5-8| = 1 + 3 = 4.\nMe at (4, 4). Distance to (4, 8) = 0 + 4 = 4.\nTie.\nBut if I go LEFT now, I can then go UP.\nSnake #1 might go RIGHT to (4, 5).\nIf Snake #1 goes to (4, 5), I am at (4, 4).\nIf I then go UP to (4, 5), we collide head-on (if it stays there) or I die.\nWait, simultaneous moves.\nTurn 6: I move LEFT to (4, 4). Snake #1 moves... let's say RIGHT to (4, 5).\nTurn 7: I move UP to (4, 5). Snake #1 moves... let's say UP to (4, 6).\nWe are fine.\nIf Snake #1 moves UP to (3, 6) in Turn 6. I am at (4, 4). We are safe.\nTurn 7: I go UP to (4, 5). Snake #1 goes RIGHT to (4, 6).\nWe are safe.\n\nGoing **UP** seems fine too.\nTurn 6: I go UP to (5, 5). Snake #1 goes RIGHT to (4, 5).\nTurn 7: I go UP to (5, 6). Snake #1 goes RIGHT to (5, 5).\nWait. If Snake #1 goes RIGHT to (4, 5) on Turn 6, and I go UP to (5, 5).\nTurn 7: I am at (5, 5). Snake #1 is at (4, 5).\nSnake #1 moves RIGHT to (5, 5). I move UP to (5, 6).\nWe collide? No, we move simultaneously.\nSnake #1 moves from (4, 5) -> (5, 5).\nI move from (5, 5) -> (5, 6).\nDestination cells are different. No collision.\nBut wait. If Snake #1 moves to (5, 5) and I am at (5, 5), we both die.\nIf Snake #1 moves to (5, 5) and I move to (5, 6), we are fine.\nSo, if I am at (5, 5), I need to make sure I don't stay there if Snake #1 wants to move there.\n\nThis implies that staying on the vertical line (x=5) might be risky if Snake #1 decides to come to x=5.\nIf I go **LEFT** to (4, 4), I move away from the enemy's x-coordinate (3).\nIf I go **UP** to (5, 5), I stay on the same x as the apple (5, 9).\nIf I go **UP**, I am heading to the enemy's general direction (x=3 to x=5).\nIf I go **LEFT**, I am heading away from the enemy.\n\nIs the enemy heading to (5, 9)?\nIf the enemy is at (3, 5), it might want (4, 8) or (3, 0).\nThe board shows apples at (4, 8) and (5, 9).\nIt's hard to predict the enemy.\nHowever, avoiding the enemy is generally good.\nGoing **LEFT** moves me to x=4.\nThe enemy is at x=3.\nIf I go **LEFT**, I am at x=4, enemy at x=3.\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (4, 5), I am at (4, 4). We are adjacent.\nIf I go **UP**, I am at (5, 5). If enemy goes RIGHT to (4, 5), we are adjacent.\nIf enemy goes UP to (3, 6), we are safe.\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\n(5, 9) is very tempting. It's straight ahead.\n(4, 8) is also tempting.\nMaybe I should just go UP. It's the shortest path to (5, 9).\nIf I go LEFT, I have to zig-zag to get to (5, 9).\nAnd (5, 9) is closer to my current X (5) than (4, 8) is? No, (4, 8) is x=4.\nLet's assume I want to eat apples efficiently.\nI'll target (5, 9).\nPath: (5, 4) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 6) -> (5, 7) -> (5, 8) -> (5, 9).\nThis is a clear path according to the board state (rows 5, 6, 7, 8 are clear at x=5).\nRow 9 has an apple at (5, 9).\nLet's check the board for obstacles at (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8).\nRow 6 (y=6): `. . . T . . . . . .` -> x=5 is empty.\nRow 7 (y=7): `. . . T . . . . . .` -> x=5 is empty.\nRow 8 (y=8): `. . . . A . . . . A` -> x=5 is empty.\nRow 9 (y=9): `. . . . . A . . . A` -> x=5 is `A` (Target).\nSo the path is clear!\n\nThe only danger is the enemy snake #1.\nSnake #1 is at (3, 5).\nIf it moves UP to (3, 6), it's fine.\nIf it moves RIGHT to (4, 5), it's fine.\nIf it moves RIGHT to (5, 5) on Turn 7... I will be at (5, 6).\nWait, on Turn 6, I go to (5, 5).\nIf Snake #1 goes to (5, 5), we die. But Snake #1 is at (3, 5). It takes 2 moves to get to (5, 5).\nTurn 6: Snake #1 goes to (4, 5).\nTurn 7: Snake #1 goes to (5, 5).\nOn Turn 6, I am at (5, 5). Snake #1 is at (4, 5).\nOn Turn 7, I am at (5, 6). Snake #1 is at (5, 5).\nWe are safe.\n\nSo, moving UP is safe and efficient.\n\nWhat if Snake #1 moves UP to (3, 6) on Turn 6, and then RIGHT to (4, 6) on Turn 7?\nI am at (5, 6).\nWe are safe.\nWhat if Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (4, 5) on Turn 6, and UP to (4, 6) on Turn 7?\nI am at (5, 5) -> (5, 6).\nWe are safe.\nWhat if Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (4, 5) on Turn 6, and RIGHT to (5, 5) on Turn 7?\nI am at (5, 5) -> (5, 6).\nSnake #1 is at (4, 5) -> (5, 5).\nWe are safe (different cells).\n\nIt seems UP is the best move. It's a straight shot to an apple.\nIf I go LEFT, I have to navigate around the enemy or take a longer path.\nI'll stick with UP.\n\nWait, one check. \"My last move information\" says \"LEFT\".\nThis means I just moved from (6, 4) to (5, 4).\nMy body is now [(6, 4), (6, 5)].\nIf I go UP to (5, 5), I am moving into the space that was previously occupied by my tail? No, my tail is at (6, 5).\n(5, 5) is empty.\nIf I go UP, my body becomes [(5, 4), (6, 4)].\nThe tail (6, 5) disappears.\nThis is fine.\n\nWhat about DOWN? (5, 3).\nPath to (3, 0).\n(5, 3) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (3, 0).\nBoard row 0: `. . . A . . . . . .`. (3, 0) is apple.\nRow 1, 2, 3 are empty.\nBut (5, 9) and (4, 8) are closer.\nAlso, going DOWN moves me away from the other apples.\nSo DOWN is less optimal.\n\nLEFT?\nPath to (4, 8).\n(4, 4) -> (4, 5) -> (4, 6) -> (4, 7) -> (4, 8).\nBoard row 8 has apple at (4, 8).\nThis path is also clear.\nDistance from (5, 4) to (4, 8): 5 steps.\nDistance from (5, 4) to (5, 9): 5 steps.\nDistance from (5, 4) to (9, 8): 8 steps.\nDistance from (5, 4) to (3, 0): 6 steps.\n\nSo (4, 8) and (5, 9) are the closest.\nI can pick one.\nIf I go UP, I target (5, 9).\nIf I go LEFT, I target (4, 8).\nIf I go UP, I have a clear straight path.\nIf I go LEFT, I have a clear straight path.\nIs there any reason to prefer one over the other?\nThe enemy is at (3, 5).\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 4), I am closer to the enemy.\nIf I go UP to (5, 5), I am further from the enemy.\nSo UP is safer regarding the enemy.\nAlso, if I go UP, I can pivot to (4, 5) next turn if I want to switch to (4, 8).\nIf I go LEFT, I am committed to x=4. To get to (5, 9), I'd have to go back right.\nSo UP provides more flexibility.\n\nFinal check.\nHead (5, 4).\nMoves:\nUP (5, 5): Safe. Path open. Apple access.\nDOWN (5, 3): Safe. Path open. Apple access.\nLEFT (4, 4): Safe. Path open. Apple access.\nRIGHT (6, 4): Death.\n\nI will choose UP.\n\nOne small detail. The prompt says \"Turn: 6 / 150\". This is early game.\nI should play safe.\nThe enemy is at (3, 5). My head at (5, 4).\nIf I go UP, I am at (5, 5). Enemy at (3, 5).\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (4, 5), distance is 1.\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (5, 5), distance is 0 (collision).\nBut enemy is at (3, 5). It needs 2 moves to get to (5, 5).\nTurn 6: Enemy to (4, 5). Me to (5, 5).\nTurn 7: Enemy to (5, 5). Me to (5, 6).\nSafe.\n\nIf I go LEFT, I am at (4, 4). Enemy at (3, 5).\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (3, 4), distance is 1.\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (4, 5), distance is 1.\nIf enemy goes DOWN then RIGHT... (4, 4).\nTurn 6: Enemy to (3, 4). Me to (4, 4).\nTurn 7: Enemy to (4, 4). Me to (4, 5).\nCollision?\nTurn 6:\nMe: (5, 4) -> (4, 4)\nEnemy: (3, 5) -> (3, 4)\nTurn 7:\nMe: (4, 4) -> (4, 5)\nEnemy: (3, 4) -> (4, 4)\nNo collision.\nWait, if Enemy goes (3, 5) -> (4, 5) on Turn 6.\nMe: (5, 4) -> (4, 4).\nTurn 7:\nMe: (4, 4) -> (4, 5)\nEnemy: (4, 5) -> (4, 6) or (5, 5).\nIf Enemy goes to (4, 6), fine. If Enemy goes to (5, 5), fine.\nIf Enemy stays at (4, 5), I go to (4, 5), we collide.\nBut enemy won't stay.\nSo both moves seem viable.\n\nHowever, UP seems slightly safer because I am further from the enemy's initial position and I am moving towards the \"top\" which usually has less traffic than the \"middle\"? No, apples are there.\nActually, there are apples at (9, 8) and (9, 9) too. The top right is also populated.\nBut (5, 9) is straight up.\nI'll stick with UP. It's the most direct route to a target.\n\nWait, I noticed something in the \"My last move information\".\nIt says \"My snake head is at (6, 4)\".\nThe state says \"Head: (5, 4)\".\nThe last move was \"LEFT\".\nSo I moved from (6, 4) to (5, 4).\nIf I move UP now, I am at (5, 5).\nThis is adjacent to (6, 5) (my tail).\n(5, 5) is safe.\n(4, 4) is safe.\n(5, 3) is safe.\n\nLet's double check the enemy coordinates in the text.\n\"Snake #1 - Head: (3, 5), Body: [(3, 6), (3, 7)]\"\nThe board shows `T` at (3, 6) and (3, 7). This matches.\nThe board shows `1` at (3, 5). This matches.\n\nIs there any move that guarantees a win?\nNo.\nIs there any move that guarantees death?\nYes, RIGHT.\n\nSo I must pick UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\nI will pick UP.\n\nWait, I should write the plan for the next turn.\n\"Plan: Move UP to (5, 5) to head towards the apple at (5, 9). Keep an eye on enemy snake #1.\"\n\nI will output the plan and then the move.\n\nOne last check. Is (5, 5) empty?\nBoard row 5: `. . . 1 . . T . . .`\nIndices 0-9.\nIndex 5 is `.`.\nYes.\nIs (4, 4) empty?\nRow 4: `. . . . . 0 T . . .`\nIndex 4 is `.`.\nYes.\nIs (5, 3) empty?\nRow 3: `. . . . . . . . . .`\nYes.\n\nOkay, UP seems good.\n\nWhat about the apple at (3, 0)?\nIf I go DOWN, I head to it.\nBut the score is 2 vs 2. I need points.\nThe apples at (4, 8) and (5, 9) are closer.\nI should go for those first.\n\nI'll choose UP.\n\nWait, if I go UP, and the enemy goes UP (to 3,6) and then RIGHT (to 4, 6) and then RIGHT (to 5, 6)...\nI am at (5, 6) -> (5, 7).\nIf Enemy goes (3, 5) -> (3, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (5, 6)...\nI am at (5, 5) -> (5, 6) -> (5, 7).\nOn turn when I am at (5, 6) and enemy at (4, 6), safe.\nNext turn I am at (5, 7) and enemy at (5, 6), safe.\nNext turn I am at (5, 8) and enemy at (5, 7), safe.\nNext turn I am at (5, 9) (Apple) and enemy at (5, 8).\nIf enemy moves to (5, 9), we collide.\nBut I get the apple first? No, simultaneous.\nIf we collide, we both die.\nBut I can't control the enemy.\nI should just focus on my move.\nI'll choose UP.\n\nFinal check on the coordinates.\n\"The first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one\"\nMy body is `[(6, 4), (6, 5)]`.\nThis means the segment attached to the head is at (6, 4).\nThe next segment is at (6, 5).\nThis is a vertical tail at x=6, y=4 and y=5.\nMy head is at (5, 4).\nSo I am at (5, 4), body goes to (6, 4) then (6, 5).\nThis forms an 'L' shape or a corner.\nMoving UP to (5, 5) keeps me away from the body.\nMoving LEFT to (4, 4) keeps me away.\nMoving DOWN to (5, 3) keeps me away.\nAll safe.\n\nI'll go UP.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (5, 5). This heads towards the apples at (5, 9) and keeps options open. Monitor enemy movement.\n\nMove: UP\n\nWait, I should make sure I don't type \"Plan: ...\" as the final output.\nThe prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nSo I can write the plan in the text, but the last line must be the word.\nOkay.\n\nOne final check.\nIs it possible the enemy is going for (3, 0)?\nIt's far. Unlikely.\nIs it possible the enemy is going for (9, 8) or (9, 9)?\nIt's at x=3, so that's far.\nMost likely it's going for (4, 8) or (5, 9) or maybe (3, 0).\nIf it goes for (4, 8), I am competing for that too if I go LEFT.\nIf it goes for (5, 9), I am competing if I go UP.\nIf I go UP, I have a head start on (5, 9).\nIf I go LEFT, I have a head start on (4, 8).\nIt's a toss up.\nLet's go UP.\n\nActually, looking at the board again.\nRow 8 has an apple at (4, 8) and (9, 8).\nRow 9 has an apple at (5, 9) and (9, 9).\nRow 0 has an apple at (3, 0).\nRow 4 has an apple at (3, 0)? No, row 0 has (3, 0).\nRow 4 has nothing (except my head).\n\nThe distribution is top-heavy and bottom-left heavy.\nMy position is (5, 4).\nGoing UP puts me in the top cluster.\nGoing DOWN puts me far away.\nGoing LEFT puts me closer to the top-left cluster.\nI think UP is fine.\n\nI'll write the response nowBased on the current board state, my head is at (5, 4) and my body segments are at (6, 4) and (6, 5). I need to choose between UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (6, 4)**: This cell contains my body segment. Moving here results in immediate death.\n2.  **UP to (5, 5)**: This cell is empty on the board and not part of my body. It is a safe move that moves me closer to the apple at (5, 9).\n3.  **DOWN to (5, 3)**: This cell is empty. It is safe but moves me away from the cluster of apples at the top of the board.\n4.  **LEFT to (4, 4)**: This cell is empty. It is safe and moves me towards the apple at (4, 8).\n\nEliminating RIGHT leaves UP, DOWN, and LEFT as safe options.\nComparing UP and LEFT:\n- Moving UP to (5, 5) puts me on a direct vertical path to the apple at (5, 9). This path appears clear based on the board state.\n- Moving LEFT to (4, 4) puts me on a path to the apple at (4, 8).\n- Both targets are equidistant from my current position (5 steps).\n- Moving UP keeps me slightly further from the enemy snake at (3, 5) than moving LEFT does, which is a marginal safety benefit.\n\nTherefore, moving UP is the preferred choice as it aims for a high-value target while maintaining safety and future flexibility.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (5, 5) to approach the apple at (5, 9). Monitor the enemy snake at (3, 5) to avoid potential head-on collisions in future turns.\n\nUP",

Like LEFT, it moves me away from the nearby apple.\n4.  **Enemy Analysis:** Snake #1 is at (3, 1). It is far away and poses no immediate threat to my move UP to (5, 9).\n5.  **Conclusion:** Moving UP is the optimal move as it secures an apple immediately. It is safe and cannot be blocked by the enemy this turn.\n\n**Plan:** Eat the apple at (5, 9) to grow. After eating, I will likely have the segment at (5, 8) added to my tail. I will then look to collect the apple at (4, 8) or (9, 8)/ (9, 9) next.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Body at [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)].\n*   Apples near enemy: (0, 0) and (9, 0) are far. (4, 8) is also far.\n*   Enemy is unlikely to come to (6, 9) or (4, 9) as they are far away.\n*   Head-on collision risk is low.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI am trapped in the top row (y=9).\n*   Moving LEFT to (4, 9) puts me closer to the apple at (0, 9) and (4, 8).\n*   Moving RIGHT to (6, 9) moves me towards the cluster of apples at (9, 8) and (9, 9).\n*   I need to avoid getting stuck in the corner. (9, 9) is a dangerous corner if I can't leave.\n\nLet's look at the board:\nRow 9: `A . . . . . . . . A` (apples at 0 and 9).\nRow 8: `. . . . A T . . . A` (apple at 4, 8 and 9, 8).\nRow 7: `. . . . . T . . . .`\nRow 6: `. . . . . T . . . .`\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 9):\n- I am at (4, 9). Down is (4, 8) which is an apple (and currently empty since I didn't move down, wait, the board state shows T at (4, 8)? No, wait. The board state provided is the *current* state before the move. It shows `T` at (4, 8). `T` is an obstacle. Wait, `T` usually denotes the tail of a snake in these visualizations.\nLet's re-read the board key.\n`9 A . . . . 0 . . . A` -> My head at 5,9 is `0`. My body is `T` at 5,8, 5,7, 5,6.\n`8 . . . . A T . . . A` -> (4,8) is `A`. (5,8) is `T` (my tail).\nSo (4,8) is an apple.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 9):\n- Next turn, I can go DOWN to (4, 8) to eat the apple. Or LEFT to (3, 9).\n- (3, 9) is empty.\n- This path seems open.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 9):\n- I am at (6, 9). Next turn I can go LEFT back, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n- (9, 9) is an apple but it's a corner.\n- (9, 8) is an apple.\n- Going RIGHT puts me in line to eat the (9,8)/(9,9) cluster.\n\nBoth seem viable. Let's check if one is \"better\".\nEnemy is at (3,0).\nApple at (0,9) is closer to (4,9) than to (6,9).\nApple at (9,9) is closer to (6,9).\nBoth sets of apples have 2 apples.\nHowever, the (9,9) cluster includes (9,8) which is right next to (9,9). If I go RIGHT, I can eat (9,9) then (9,8).\nIf I go LEFT, I can eat (0,9) then (4,8).\n\nLet's look at the immediate safety.\n(4,9) and (6,9) are both empty.\nNeither leads to immediate death.\n\nI will choose LEFT to head towards the left-side apples to avoid potentially cornering myself at (9,9) if the enemy decides to come up the right side (unlikely, but possible).\n\n**Rationale:**\n1.  **Current State:** Head at (5, 9).\n2.  **Move Evaluation:**\n    *   **UP:** Off board. **Dead.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (5, 8). Currently occupied by my body. **Dead.**\n    *   **LEFT:** (4, 9). Valid empty space. Leads to apples at (0, 9) and (4, 8).\n    *   **RIGHT:** (6, 9). Valid empty space. Leads to apples at (9, 9) and (9, 8).\n3.  **Decision:** Both LEFT and RIGHT are safe. I choose LEFT to approach the cluster of apples on the left side. This keeps my options open and avoids pushing towards the corner at (9,9) immediately.\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to (4,9). On the next turn, move DOWN to (4,8) to eat the apple.\n\nLEFT",

There are no obstacles between me and the apple at (4, 8).\n    *   **Enemy Analysis:** Snake #1 is at (9, 1) with a long tail on the bottom row. They are likely heading up towards the apples at the top right. They are not an immediate threat to my current position (1, 8).\n    *   **Choice:** While both are safe, moving **RIGHT** aligns me directly with the apple at (4, 8). I am currently at (1, 8), and the apple is at (4, 8). This is a straight line of open space. Moving RIGHT is the most direct path to the nearest cluster of apples (4,8 and 9,8).\n    *   *Self-Correction/Refinement:* I am at (1, 8). If I go RIGHT, I am at (2, 8).

Specifically, (2, 9) is not occupied in the provided body list `[(1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9)]`, but looking at the board map `9 T T 0 . . .`, the `0` is at (2,9). Wait, the body list shows `head=(2,8)`, `body=[(1,8), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9)]`. So (2,9) is **Empty**. However, looking at the board map, Row 9 has `T T 0 ...`. The `0` at (2,9) is the head? No, the header says `Head: (2,8)`. The board map shows the head at (2,8) as `0` in row 8: `8 T T 0 ...`. In row 9, the `0` must be a tail segment. Wait, the body list does not include (2,9). The board map shows `9 T T 0 . .`. Let's check the body list again: `Body: [(1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9)]`. The head is (2,8). The first body segment is (1,8). Then (0,8). Then (0,9). Then (1,9). There is no segment at (2,9). The board map shows `9 T T 0 .`. If the map is accurate, (2,9) is occupied. If the body list is accurate, (2,9) is empty. I must trust the explicit coordinate list over the visual map if they conflict, as the map is a representation. The list `Body: [(1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9)]` does not contain (2,9).

Since `RIGHT` is safe (no body/wall/enemy collision), I must take it to maximize score and growth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI will move **RIGHT** to $(4, 8)$ to eat the apple and grow. This puts me at 5 apples and increases my length, which is crucial for future survival and blocking the enemy.\n\nRIGHT",

However, the text description of the board state says Row 8 ends with `A` (at 9,8) and Row 9 starts with `T` (at 0,9).\n        Let's re-verify the coordinates.\n        Map shows `9 T . . . . . . . .

Strategic Analysis:**\n*   **Options:** LEFT (Death), RIGHT (Safe), UP (Safe), DOWN (Safe).\n*   **Apple Proximity:**\n    *   **UP** leads to $(4, 9)$. Looking at the map, there is an Apple at `(9, 9)` on the top right, and one at `(9, 8)` just below it. Moving UP moves me away from the vertical cluster of apples at `x=9`. It puts me in the open top lane, which can be useful for maneuvering, but doesn't immediately target a cluster.\n    *   **DOWN** leads to $(4, 7)$. This moves me toward the apple at $(4, 6)$.\n    *   **RIGHT** leads to $(5, 8)$. This moves me horizontally across the board. The target here would be the cluster at $(9, 8), (9, 9)$.\n*   **Enemy Analysis:**\n    *   Snake #1 is at $(7, 2)$ in the bottom right. It is currently collecting apples near its tail.\n    *   If I move **DOWN** toward $(4, 6)$, I stay away from Snake #1.\n    *   If I move **RIGHT** toward the top-right corner, I enter the top-right quadrant. Snake #1 is in the bottom-right. It would take Snake #1 roughly 5-6 turns to reach me up here, assuming it wanted to.\n*   **Decision Logic:**\n    *   `LEFT` is suicide.\n    *   `UP` is open space but moves away from the immediate apple at `(9,8)` (which is to the right) and `(4,6)` (which is down).\n    *   `DOWN` targets `(4,6)`. This is a single apple.\n    *   `RIGHT` targets the cluster `(9,8), (9,9)`. There are two apples here.\n    *   Moving `RIGHT` aligns with the horizontal path I am currently on. My body stretches from `x=0` to `x=4` at `y=8`. Moving `RIGHT` extends this line. It keeps my body linear and parallel to the top edge, which is usually easier to defend and navigate than a vertical line in the middle of the board.\n    *   Targeting the `(9,8), (9,9)` cluster is high value (2 apples close together).\n    *   Since `RIGHT` is safe and leads to a high-value cluster, it is the best move.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\nMove RIGHT towards the corner apples `(9,8)` and `(9,9)`. Keep an eye on Snake #1 moving from the bottom right.\n\nRIGHT",

After a left move I can only continue left, up, or down, but I lose the ability to head right later without stepping onto my own body.\n- Moving DOWN brings me toward the apple at (1,1) but away from the cluster of apples at y\u202f\u2265\u202f6, and it also reduces my y\u2011coordinate, making it harder to reach the nearest apple (9,6).\n- Moving UP increases my y\u2011coordinate, directly toward the nearest apple (9,6) and the other high\u2011y apples.

My current position $(6, 8)$ is on the same row as $(9, 8)$. The apple at $(9, 9)$ is diagonally adjacent.\n*   **Enemy Analysis (Critical):** Snake #1 is at $(8, 4)$. The vertical gap between my head $(6, 8)$ and the enemy head $(8, 4)$ is only 4 units ($8-4=4$).\n    *   *Hypothetical Trajectory:* If the enemy moves UP three times: $(8,4) \\to (8,5) \\to (8,6) \\to (8,7)$. If I continue moving RIGHT to chase the apple at $(9, 8)$, I would be at $(9, 8)$. The enemy could potentially reach $(8, 8)$, creating a direct adjacency threat. Even worse, if they move to $(9, 7)$, they could challenge me for the apple.\n    *   *Positioning:* Moving RIGHT to $(7, 8)$ puts me at $x=7$, directly above the enemy's current $x=8$. This aligns our columns and sets up a potential head-on collision or a race for the top-right corner apples.\n*   **Option Comparison:**\n    *   **RIGHT (to 7, 8):** This is the most direct path to the $(9, 8)$ apple. However, it engages the enemy directly. If the enemy decides to move UP aggressively, I am entering a contested zone with limited escape routes (I would be near the right wall).\n    *   **UP (to 6, 9):** This moves towards the $(9, 9)$ apple. Crucially, it moves **away** from the vertical column where the enemy is approaching ($x=8$). By staying at $x=6$ and moving to the top wall, I maintain a safer distance from the enemy. If the enemy commits to the $x=8$ column to chase $(9, 8)$ or $(9, 9)$, I can react from a safer position. Furthermore, being at $y=9$ allows me to traverse the top row if the enemy blocks the approach from below.\n    *   **DOWN (to 6, 7):** This moves away from the apples and towards the empty middle of the board. It is safe but passive.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will choose **UP**. While I want the apples at $(9, 8)$ and $(9, 9)$, the enemy is currently directly below the path to $(9, 8)$. Engaging them at $(7, 8)$ or $(8, 8)$ is risky given the narrow vertical space between us. Moving **UP** to $(6, 9)$ positions me on the top wall, safe from the vertical approach of the enemy, and allows me to secure the $(9, 9)$ apple or approach the $(9, 8)$ apple from a safer angle (flanking from the top).\n\n**Plan:** Move UP to the top row to distance myself from the approaching enemy. Prepare to move RIGHT towards the apples at $(9, 9)$ and $(9, 8)$ once the enemy's trajectory is clear or if they move past the critical vertical zone.\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

The prompt's \"Body\" list shows a double `(6, 8)`, suggesting I **did eat** an apple at $(6, 9)$ (my head last turn).\n    *   *Checking Apples:* The previous board state listed apples at $(9,8), (9,9), (1,1), (4,6), (9,6)$. None were at $(6,9)$. Wait, if I moved UP to $(6,9)$ and ate, the apple must have spawned there or the prompt has a discrepancy. Regardless, my current body length suggests I consumed something.

This limits my movement to LEFT and RIGHT.\n*   **Option Comparison:**\n    *   **LEFT (to 5, 9):** This moves towards the left side of the board. It offers safety but moves away from the apples at $(9, 9)$ and $(9, 8)$. The enemy is focused on the right side ($x=8$), so this creates distance, but if the game is about scoring, this is a retreat.\n    *   **RIGHT (to 7, 9):** This moves towards the cluster of apples at $(9, 9)$ and $(9, 8)$.\n        *   *Path:* $(6,9) \\to (7,9) \\to (8,9) \\to (9,9)$.\n        *   *Enemy Interaction:* The enemy is at $(8,5)$. If they move UP twice, they reach $(8,7)$. If I am at $(8,9)$, I am safe from direct collision provided they don't jump up 4 spaces instantly.\n        *   *Risk:* If the enemy moves UP to $(8,6)$ next, and I move to $(7,9)$, we are maintaining our distance.\n        *   *Reward:* I am on track to eat the apple at $(9,9)$ in 2 turns.\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Staying at the top row allows me to flank the enemy. The enemy is currently below me. Moving **RIGHT** is the only direction that pursues points while maintaining the positional advantage (height) over the enemy.\n    *   If I move LEFT, I surrender the apples on the right side to the enemy.\n    *   If I move RIGHT, I threaten the apples at $(9,9)$ and $(9,8)$.\n    *   The enemy is at $(8,5)$. If they move UP to $(8,6)$, they are still far away. If they move RIGHT to $(9,5)$, they are moving away from the top row apples I am targeting.\n    *   Therefore, **RIGHT** is the optimal move to secure the apple at $(9,9)$.\n\n**Plan:** Move RIGHT towards $(9,9)$. The enemy is currently low on the board ($y=5$), so I have time to secure the top-right corner apples. Monitor the enemy's vertical movement next turn.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

I did **not** grow this turn.\n    *   *Contradiction:* The prompt states I collected 5 apples total. This implies I should have 5 body segments (Head + 4 Body). The prompt shows a Body list of length 5. This is inconsistent with the \"non-growing\" move. However, the Board State and the official \"Scores\" update are the ultimate source of truth. I will trust the Board State for immediate collision safety (which shows no gap) and assume I am length 6 (Head + 5 Body).\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:**\n    *   **Head:** $(9, 7)$. Previous was $(8, 6)$? No, previous was $(8, 6)$. Wait, checking the prompt: \"Enemy Snake #1 - Head: (9, 7)\". Previous prompt said (8, 6). Let's check the Board State.\n    *   **Board State Check:** Row 7 shows `A . . . . . . . . 1`. The `1` is at $(9, 7)$. Correct. The enemy moved UP and RIGHT.\n    *   **Body:** $[(8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4)]$.\n    *   **Observation:** The enemy is adjacent to the apple at $(9, 6)$ (directly below it). The enemy is also adjacent to the apple at $(9, 8)$ (directly above it). The enemy is effectively occupying the top right corner.\n*   **Apples:**\n    *   $(9, 9)$: Present.\n    *   $(9, 8)$: Present.\n    *   $(9, 6)$: Present.\n    *   $(4, 6)$: Present.\n    *   $(1, 1)$: Present.\n\n**2. Safety Analysis (Immediate Moves from Head $(8, 9)$):**\n*   **UP (to (8, 10)):** Off board. **DEAD.**\n*   **LEFT (to (7, 9)):**\n    *   **Occupied:** My body is at $(7, 9)$ (previous head position).\n    *   **Result:** Collision. **DEAD.**\n*   **DOWN (to (8, 8)):**\n    *   **Board:** Row 8 shows `T T T T T`. Index 8 is `T`.\n    *   **Occupied:** Wait, Row 8 in the prompt is: `9 . . . . . . T T 0 A`.\n        *   Wait, Row 9 is `9 . . . . . . T T 0 A`.\n        *   Row 8 is `8 . . . . T T T . . A`.\n        *   So `(8, 8)` is Empty.\n    *   **Enemy Collision:** The enemy head is at $(9, 7)$. If I move to $(8, 8)$, I am adjacent. If the enemy moves to $(8, 8)$, it's a head-on collision (both die).\n    *   **Risk:** The enemy is likely targeting the apple at $(9, 8)$ (UP) or $(9, 6)$ (DOWN).\n*   **RIGHT (to (9, 9)):**\n    *   **Board:** Row 9 index 9 is `A`.\n    *   **Occupied:** No snake body.\n    *   **Enemy Collision:** The enemy head is at $(9, 7)$. They cannot reach $(9, 9)$ in one move (distance is 2). They can move to $(9, 8)$.\n    *   **Result:** Safe.\n\n**3. Strategic Analysis & Win Condition:**\n*   **Win Condition:** I have 5 apples. I need 45 to win immediately (assuming enemy dies) or just survive/beat them. The enemy has 5 apples.\n*   **The Corner Trap:** The enemy is currently at $(9, 7)$. The apples are at $(9, 8), (9, 9), (9, 6)$.\n    *   If the enemy moves UP to $(9, 8)$, they eat that apple.\n    *   If the enemy moves DOWN to $(9, 6)$, they eat that apple.\n    *   If the enemy moves UP again, they are at $(9, 9)$.\n*   **My Move:**\n    *   **Option A (RIGHT -> $(9, 9)$):** I eat the apple at $(9, 9)$. I am safe from immediate collision (enemy cannot reach me). This secures a point.\n    *   **Option B (DOWN -> $(8, 8)$):** I do not eat an apple. I move into a position adjacent to the enemy. The enemy is likely to move UP to $(9, 8)$ or DOWN to $(9, 6)$.\n        *   If I go DOWN to $(8, 8)$, and the enemy goes UP to $(9, 8)$, I am safe.\n        *   If I go DOWN to $(8, 8)$, and the enemy goes DOWN to $(9, 6)$, I am safe.\n        *   However, the enemy might be trapped. If the enemy is at $(9, 7)$, they are vulnerable. But they have apples surrounding them.\n*   **Trap Opportunity:** If I move **RIGHT** to $(9, 9)$, I eat the apple (growing). The enemy is likely to chase the closer apples at $(9, 8)$ or $(9, 6)$.\n    *   If the enemy goes to $(9, 8)$, I am at $(9, 9)$. I can move DOWN to $(9, 8)$ next turn (eating it and potentially hitting the enemy tail).\n    *   Actually, there is a head-on risk if the enemy tries to go to $(9, 9)$. But they are at $(9, 7)$. They cannot go to $(9, 9)$ this turn.\n*   **Conclusion:** Moving **RIGHT** to $(9, 9)$ is the highest value move. It secures an apple immediately. It puts me in the corner, but I can plan an escape route. Moving down to $(8, 8)$ denies me the apple and leaves me on the \"edge\" of the enemy's cluster. Taking the apple is the correct aggressive play.\n\n**Plan:** Move RIGHT to eat the apple at (9, 9). From there, monitor the enemy's move to (9, 8) or (9, 6). If they go to (9, 8), I will be trapped at (9, 9) if I don't act, so next turn I must move DOWN to (9, 8) or LEFT to (8, 9). If they go to (9, 6), I can move DOWN to (9, 8) safely.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

A`.\n        Index 9 is `A`.\n        \n        **Is it possible the apple at (9,8) is actually at (8,9)?** No.\n        **Is it possible the apple at (9,8) is actually at (8,9) or (9,8)?**\n        \n        **Let's check the Enemy Head at (9,6).**\n        Row 6: `6 . . . . A . . T T 1`.\n        Index 9 is `1`. Correct.\n        Index 8 is `T`. Enemy body. Correct.\n        \n        **Let's check the Enemy Body.**\n        `8 . . . . T T T . . A`.\n        At Row 8, Index 4,5,6 are `T`.\n        This matches Enemy Body segments at (6,8)?? No.\n        Enemy body: [(8,6), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4)...]\n        \n        **Wait, let's look at Row 8 of the Enemy.**\n        `8 . . . . T T T . . A`\n        Indices 4,5,6 are `T`.\n        My body is at (4,8), (5,8), (6,8).\n        These are MY body parts.\n        \n        **Let's re-read the Enemy Body from prompt:** `[(8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2)]`.\n        Enemy body does not go to y=8.\n        \n        **So the `T` at Row 8, indices 4,5,6 belong to ME.**\n        \n        **What about Row 9?**\n        `9 . . . . . . T T T 0`\n        Indices 6, 7, 8 are `T`.\n        My body is at (6,9), (7,9), (8,9). Correct.\n        \n        **NOW, THE APPLES.**\n        Row 8, Index 9 is `A`. This is NOT in the apple list: `(9, 8), (1, 1), (4, 6), (2, 4), (6, 5)`.\n        Wait, the list includes `(9, 8)`.\n        Row 8, Index 9 corresponds to coordinate (9, 8).\n        \n        **SO:**\n        The ASCII shows `A` at (9,8).\n        The text says `Apples at: (9, 8)`.\n        The ASCII shows `A` at Row 8, Index 9.\n        This matches.\n        \n        **Wait, I previously thought Row 8 Index 9 was `A`. Yes.**\n        \n        **What about Row 9?**\n        Row 9 is `9 . . . . . . T T T 0`.\n        This is 10 columns.\n        Indices 0-9.\n        Index 6: `T`\n        Index 7: `T`\n        Index 8: `T`\n        Index 9: `0`\n        \n        If `0` is my head at (9,9), and `T` at (8,9), (7,9), (6,9).\n        \n        **Is there an apple at (9,9)?** No. I just ate it. The text says \"Apples at: (9, 8)\". So (9,9) is NOT an apple.\n        \n        **So where is the error?**\n        The prompt says \"Apples at: (9, 8)...\".\n        The ASCII shows `A` at (9,8).\n        The ASCII shows `0` at (9,9).\n        The ASCII shows `T` at (8,9).\n        \n        **WAIT.** The prompt says:\n        `9 . . . . . .

Correct.\n        **Apple at (1,1):** Row 1, Col 1 = `A`. Correct (Row 1 is `1 . A ...`).\n        **Apple at (4,6):** Row 6, Col 4 = `A`. Correct (Row 6 is `6 . . . . A ...`).\n        **Apple at (2,4):** Row 4, Col 2 = `A`. Correct (Row 4 is `4 . . A ...`).\n        **Apple at (6,5):** Row 5, Col 6 = `A`. Correct (Row 5 is `5 . . . . . . A ...`).\n        \n        **All apples match the ASCII.**\n        \n        **What about the Enemy Head (9,6)?**\n        Row 6: `6 . . . . A . . T T 1`.\n        Col 9 = `1`. Correct.\n        \n        **What about My Head (9,9)?**\n        Row 9: `9 . . . . . . T T T 0`.\n        Col 9 = `0`. Correct.\n        \n        **So the ASCII is consistent with the text description.**\n        \n        **Why did I think there was a conflict?**\n        I thought Row 9 showed `T T T 0` and I looked for an `A`.\n        The text said Apples include (9,8).\n        The ASCII shows Row 8, Col 9 is `A`.\n        \n        **Okay, the board is:**\n        Row 9 (y=9): Indices 6,7,8 are `T` (My body). Index 9 is `0` (My head).\n        Row 8 (y=8): Indices 9 is `A` (Apple).\n        \n        **So, moving RIGHT (to 10,9) is Off Board.**\n        **Moving UP (to 9,10) is Off Board.**\n        \n        **Current Head: (9,9).**\n        **Possible moves:**\n        1.  **LEFT:** to (8,9).

(And growing if they ate).\n            \n            *   **Enemy Move Prediction:**\n                *   Enemy at (9,6). Apples at (9,8) and (9,6).\n                *   They will likely move UP to (9,7) or (9,8) or DOWN to (9,5) or (9,6) (if apple is there).\n                *   Wait, text says Enemy Head: (9, 6).\n                *   If Enemy moves UP to (9,7), then UP to (9,8), then UP to (9,9).\n                *   If Enemy moves UP to (9,7), they are at (9,7).\n                *   If I move DOWN to (9,8), I am at (9,8).\n                *   If Enemy moves UP to (9,7) and I move DOWN to (9,8), the distance is 1.\n                *   Can Enemy reach (9,8)?\n                *   Enemy is at (9,6).\n                *   Move 1: (9,7).\n                *   Move 2: (9,8).\n                *   So Enemy cannot reach (9,8) this turn.\n                *   Can Enemy reach (9,9) this turn?

No, only if heads collide.\n                \n                *   **What if Enemy moves RIGHT?** Off board. Dead.\n                *   **What if Enemy moves LEFT?** To (8,6).\n                    *   My body is at (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8).\n                    *   (8,6) is safe from my body.\n                    \n                *   **What if Enemy moves DOWN?** To (9,5).\n                    *   (9,5) is safe.\n            \n            *   **Safety of DOWN:**\n                *   Target: (9,8).\n                *   Is it occupied? No. It's an apple.\n                *   Is it occupied by Enemy? No (Enemy at 9,6).\n                *   Is it occupied by Me? No (Head at 9,9).\n                *   **Is it backwards?** My previous head was (8,9). (9,8) is not (8,9).\n                *   So DOWN is safe.\n        \n        3.  **RIGHT:** Off board. Dead.\n        4.  **UP:** Off board. Dead.\n        \n        **So the only safe move is DOWN.**\n        \n        **Wait, let's double check LEFT.**\n        Head at (9,9). Left is (8,9).\n        Body: (8,9) is the first element of the body.\n        So moving LEFT is backwards into the body? No, it's into the segment right behind the head.\n        \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself\".\n        Yes, (8,9) is directly behind.\n        \n        **So I must move DOWN.**\n        \n        **Strategy for next turn (if I survive):**\n        I will be at (9,8) and eat the apple. I grow.\n        I will need to escape the corner.\n        Enemy is at (9,6).\n        If Enemy moves UP to (9,7) and I am at (9,8), we are adjacent.\n        Next turn, I can move DOWN to (9,7) (risk head-on if Enemy goes UP to 9,8) or LEFT to (8,8).\n        If I move DOWN to (9,7), and Enemy moves UP to (9,8), we swap places? No, we would collide if we cross? No, simultaneous. If I go to 9,7 and Enemy goes to 9,8, we don't collide.\n        \n        If Enemy is at (9,7) and I am at (9,8), and I move DOWN to (9,7), that is a head-on collision (both at 9,7).\n        If Enemy moves UP to (9,8), that is a head-on collision (both at 9,8).\n        \n        So if I am at (9,8), I should probably move LEFT to (8,8) to avoid the line of conflict, unless I know I can beat them.\n        (8,8) is currently empty (Row 8, Col 8 is `.`).\n        \n        **Current Plan:** Move DOWN to (9,8). Eat apple. Plan to move LEFT to (8,8) next turn to get out of the corner and away from the enemy cluster.\n        \n        **Wait, is there ANY other move?**\n        The prompt shows `T T T 0` at row 9.\n        Indices 6,7,8 are T. Index 9 is 0.\n        Is it possible that the ASCII is shifted?\n        `9 . . . . . . T T T 0`\n        Let's count the dots. 6 dots.\n        ` . . . . . . ` (6 dots) + ` T T T 0` (4 chars) = 10 chars.\n        Indices 0-5: Dots. 6: T, 7: T, 8: T, 9: 0.\n        \n        Is it possible that one of the T's is an apple?\n        No, text says apples are specific.\n        \n        Is it possible my body is NOT at (8,9)?\n        Prompt: \"Body: [(8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8)]\".\n        Yes, (8,9) is there.\n        \n        So I cannot move LEFT.\n        \n        I cannot move UP or RIGHT.\n        \n        I must move DOWN.\n        \n        **Wait, look at Row 8 again.**\n        `8 . . . . T T T . . A`\n        Indices 4,5,6 are `T`.\n        These are my body (4,8), (5,8), (6,8).\n        Index 7 is `.`.\n        Index 8 is `.`.\n        Index 9 is `A`.\n        \n        If I move DOWN to (9,8), I will be at Index 9, Row 8.\n        The cell is `A`. Safe.\n        \n        What if the enemy moves LEFT to (8,6)?\n        Enemy body is currently at (8,6) (from previous turn).\n        So Enemy cannot move LEFT to (8,6).\n        Enemy could move DOWN to (9,5) or UP to (9,7).\n        \n        If Enemy moves UP to (9,7), and I move DOWN to (9,8), we are adjacent vertically.\n        No collision this turn.\n        \n        **Decision:** Move DOWN.\n        \n        **Plan for next turn:** I will be at (9,8). I will have eaten an apple.\n        I need to get out of the corner.\n        If I move LEFT to (8,8), I am safe from the enemy (who is likely at 9,7 or 9,6).\n        If I move DOWN to (9,7), I might hit the enemy if they stay at (9,6) or if they move UP to (9,7).\n        So LEFT to (8,8) is the safest escape route.\n        \n        **Check if (8,8) is safe next turn.**\n        My body will be: (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (5,8), (4,8).\n        (8,8) is NOT in my body. So I can go there.\n        \n        **Summary:** Move DOWN. Eat apple. Next turn move LEFT.\n        \n        **Wait, is there any scenario where DOWN is bad?**\n        What if the enemy moved UP to (9,7) and grew (ate apple at 9,6)?\n        Enemy body: (9,7), (9,6), (8,6)...\n        If I go DOWN to (9,8), I am adjacent to (9,7).\n        What if the enemy moves UP to (9,8) this turn?\n        Enemy is at (9,6). To get to (9,8) in one turn is impossible.\n        So collision at (9,8) is impossible this turn.\n        \n        What about (8,8)?\n        If I go to (9,8), then next turn go to (8,8).\n        Is (8,8) occupied?\n        My body: (8,9) is there.\n        (8,8) is not listed as body.\n        Enemy body: (8,6) is there.\n        So (8,8) is empty.\n        \n        One risk: The enemy might be at (9,7) and I move to (9,8). Then next turn I go to (8,8).\n        If the enemy is at (9,7), they could move LEFT to (8,7).\n        If I go to (8,8), and Enemy goes to (8,7), we are adjacent.\n        \n        Let's stick to the plan.\n        \n        **Move:** DOWN.\n        \n        **Plan for next turn:** Move LEFT to (8,8).\n        \n        **Wait, check if I can move LEFT from (9,8) next turn.**\n        Head (9,8). Left is (8,8).\n        Previous head would be (9,8) (if I move DOWN this turn).\n        So (9,8) becomes part of body.\n        (8,8) is not body.\n        So yes.\n        \n        **Double check coordinate system.**\n        (x,y).\n        (9,9) is Top Right.\n        (9,8) is below (9,9).\n        So DOWN is (9,8).\n        \n        **Final check on safety of DOWN.**\n        (9,8) is an apple.\n        (9,8) is not occupied by my body.\n        (9,8) is not occupied by enemy body.\n        (9,8) is not occupied by enemy head (distance 2+).\n        (9,8) is not off board.\n        (9,8) is not backwards (backwards would be (8,9)).\n        \n        So DOWN is safe and correct.\n        \n        **Wait, is there any other move?**\n        No.\n        \n        **Rationale Summary:**\n        1. Current head: (9,9).\n        2. Moves: UP (off board), RIGHT (off board), LEFT (into own body at 8,9).\n        3. Only safe move is DOWN to (9,8).\n        4. (9,8) contains an apple.\n        5. Enemy is at (9,6), cannot reach (9,8) this turn.\n        6. Next turn strategy: Move LEFT to (8,8) to escape the corner and avoid the enemy at (9,7).\n\n**Plan:** Move DOWN to eat the apple at (9, 8). Immediately plan to move LEFT on the next turn to (8, 8) to escape the corner and maintain distance from the enemy snake likely advancing up the right column.\nDOWN",

Board State & Safety Check:**\n*   **Current Head:** $(9, 9)$.\n*   **Immediate Moves:**\n    *   **UP / RIGHT:** Both are off the board (coords > 9). Illegal.\n    *   **LEFT:** Moves to $(8, 9)$.\n        *   Looking at the board: `9 . . . . . . T T T 0`.\n        *   Col 9 is `0` (Head). Col 8 is `T` (Body). Col 7 is `T` (Body).\n        *   My body is currently at $(8, 9)$. Moving LEFT would cause immediate suicide.\n    *   **DOWN:** Moves to $(9, 8)$.\n        *   Row 8: `8 . . . . T T T . . A`.\n        *   Col 9 is `A` (Apple).\n        *   The cell is empty of obstacles (only contains the target apple).\n        *   Is it backwards? My previous head was $(8, 9)$. $(9, 8)$ is not $(8, 9)$, so it is not a direct back-move.\n        *   Is it occupied by Enemy? Enemy head is at $(9, 6)$. Distance is $|9-9| + |8-6| = 2$. Enemy cannot reach $(9, 8)$ this turn.\n\n**2. Strategic Reasoning:**\n*   **Resource Gain:** Moving **DOWN** captures the apple at $(9, 8)$, increasing my score to 8 and causing my tail to stay put (growing the snake).\n*   **Escape Plan:** Being at $(9, 9)$ is a corner. Moving DOWN to $(9, 8)$ places me in the corner with a single exit: **LEFT** to $(8, 8)$.\n    *   Next turn, I will move **LEFT** to $(8, 8)$.\n    *   This moves me away from the enemy at $(9, 6)$ and opens up the board to the left.\n    *   $(8, 8)$ is currently safe (Row 8, Col 8 is `.`).\n*   **Enemy Management:** The enemy is at $(9, 6)$. If they move UP, they will be at $(9, 7)$. This keeps them pinned against the wall, which is advantageous for me.\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\nThere is only one legal move. It is also the optimal move as it secures an apple and sets up an escape route.\n**Plan:** Move DOWN to eat the apple at $(9, 8)$. Next turn, move LEFT to $(8, 8)$ to escape the corner.\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",
