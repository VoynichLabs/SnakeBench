Apples EVERYWHERE, closest for us is (0,1) at Manhattan 3 \u2013 we SNIPE that in 3 moves EZ, while enemy needs 10+ to even sniff it. \ud83d\ude02\n\nQUICK SCAN \u2013 ALL 4 MOVES SAFE AF (no offs, no bodies, enemy too far for collision this turn):\n- **UP** to (1,4): Empty, but heads north away from quick apple. Future options good, but why detour? \ud83e\udd14\n- **DOWN** to (1,2): Empty row2 col1. Keeps ALL 4 follow-ups open next turn (left to wall apple path, right to (2,2) empty, up back home, down to (1,1) empty). PERFECT for snipin' (0,1) via down-down-left OR left-down. Space galore, no trap! \ud83d\udcaf\n- **LEFT** to (0,3): Empty, walls us early (no left option next). Still hits apple path (down-down), but fewer escapes. Risky if enemy swings wild later.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,3): Empty, straight shot to (6,3) apple in 5... but that's SLOWER than our 3-move prize. Why gift enemy time to grow? NOPE. \ud83d\ude24\n\nBEST PLAY: DOWN. Maximizes options, closes on apple FASTEST, keeps us nimble to BOX #0 later when he chokes on those right-side apples (7,2)(6,2). He goes left? We grow left, swing center, trap him against wall like a NOOB! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5 Who's gettin' crashed first? US? NEVER!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat (0,1) in 3 turns via flexible path (down-left-down or down-down-left), grab (0,0) next for length 3. Then rocket center (col4-6 apples) to intercept #0's inevitable left push \u2013 grow faster, body-block his lanes, force crash! Dominate or die tryin'! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nDOWN",

So those are out.  \n- That leaves LEFT and DOWN as the only safe moves.  \n- If I go LEFT to (7,3), I open a fresh column, get closer to the tasty apple at (5,3) \ud83c\udf4e and keep my options wide open.  \n- Going DOWN to (8,2) would push me deeper into the same column, but then I'd be stuck moving only LEFT or further DOWN, eventually hitting the bottom wall.

          "rationale": "Yo CHAT! \ud83c\udf89 What's good, fam? We're LIVE at turn 22, apples 14 vs 7, head at (3,2). Adjacent cells: LEFT (2,2), UP (3,3) \u2013 DEAD (our own body), DOWN (3,1), RIGHT (4,2). UP is a no\u2011go, so we have three safe options. Which one opens the most pathways and puts us on a direct bite\u2011path to the next apple?\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Plan for the next few turns: \n- Move LEFT to (2,2) \u2013 this pushes us into the spacious left corridor, keeps our long right\u2011hand tail far from the wall, and sets us up to drop down to (2,1) next turn and eat that apple. \n- From there we can swing up toward the (1,5)/(0,4) cluster while using the left wall as a safe retreat. \n- Keep the enemy\u2019s column\u20119 vertical line in mind; they\u2019ll keep marching down, so staying left\u2011most gives us time to out\u2011maneuver them. \n- Never back\u2011track into (3,2) \u2013 that\u2019s a self\u2011kill. \n- Aim to grow while staying in open space, so we can later swing right to snag (4,5),(5,6) and lock down the top\u2011right apple stash. \nLEFT",
