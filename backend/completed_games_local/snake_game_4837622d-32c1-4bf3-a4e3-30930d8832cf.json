This direction is the only one that advances toward the apple-rich area, and because the enemy snake #0 is far to the right (head at (6,\u202f5)), it cannot reach (2,\u202f7) in a single turn, so there is no risk of a head\u2011on collision. Moving up also leaves the column x\u202f=\u202f2 largely empty, preserving multiple escape routes for future turns.\n\nAmong the safe moves, UP is the only one that makes progress toward the apples and keeps the board state open for later turns.\n\nPlan: Continue upward toward the apple rows at y\u202f\u2265\u202f7, then branch left to collect the nearby apples.
