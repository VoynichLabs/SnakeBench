This cell is empty. It moves towards the apples at (1, 3) and (1, 1).\n*   **LEFT:** Target (0, 6). This cell is empty. It is adjacent to the apple at (0, 7).\n*   **RIGHT:** Target (2, 6). This is my neck/body segment. **INVALID.**\n\n**2. Evaluate Apple Targets:**\n*   **Apple (0, 7):** Distance 2 from current head (1, 6). This is the highest priority and safest target.\n*   **Apple (1, 3):** Distance 3 from current head. Snake #0 is currently at (2, 1), making it roughly 3 moves away from (1, 3) as well.\n*   **Apple (6, 8):** Distance 7 from head.\n*   **Apple (8, 6):** Distance 7 from head.\n*   **Apple (1, 1):** Distance 5 from head.\n\n**3. Strategic Selection:**\nMy previous move to (1, 6) successfully positioned me to take the top-left apple.\n*   Moving **UP** to (1, 7) allows me to take (0, 7) on the next turn by moving LEFT.\n*   Moving **LEFT** to (0, 6) allows me to take (0, 7) on the next turn by moving UP.\n\nMoving **UP** to (1, 7) is slightly better because it stays further away from the boundary for one more turn and gives better vision of the board. It also keeps me vertically aligned with the lower apples should I need to dive down later.\n\n**4. Enemy Analysis:**\nSnake #0 is at (2, 1). It is currently very close to the apples at (1, 1) and (1, 3). I should secure (0, 7) quickly and then evaluate if I can contest (1, 3) or if I should head towards the right side of the board (6, 8) and (8, 6) to avoid a direct confrontation with a longer snake in a tight corner.\n\n**Strategic Plan:**\nMove UP to (1, 7). Next turn, move LEFT to collect the apple at (0, 7). From (0, 7), I will likely head DOWN towards (1, 3) or RIGHT towards the central-upper area to stay mobile.\n\nUP",

It is on the same Y-axis as my current position and several cells to the right.\n*   **Apple (8, 6):** Located further right and slightly down.\n*   **Apple (3, 5):** Centrally located.\n*   **Apple (0, 0), (2, 3):** These are currently being contested by Snake #0, which is much closer to them (at (1, 3)).\n\n**3. Enemy Analysis (Snake #0):**\n*   Snake #0 is at (1, 3). It is elongated and positioned in the bottom-left quadrant.\n*   It is currently likely to target the apples at (2, 3) or (0, 0).\n*   By moving along the top (Y=8 or Y=9), I stay safely away from its head and body.\n\n**4. Strategic Selection:**\n*   **UP to (0, 9):** This puts me in the corner. While safe, it limits immediate maneuverability.\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 8):** This is the most efficient path toward the nearest apple at (6, 8). It keeps me away from the wall and allows me to maintain forward momentum without getting trapped in a corner.\n\n**Strategic Plan:**\nMove RIGHT towards the apple at (6, 8). By staying on the upper portion of the board, I avoid the congested area where Snake #0 is operating. This allows me to collect the eastern apples (6, 8) and (8, 6) while Snake #0 is occupied in the bottom-left.\n\nRIGHT",

I will monitor Snake #0's movement; if they move toward (3, 5), I will likely stay on the upper rows to avoid a mid-board confrontation until I have a length advantage or a clear path to the remaining apples.\n\nRIGHT",

If I move DOWN to (6, 7), I am 2 units away from their current head. If they move RIGHT to (5, 6), we would be even closer.\n- The safest path to the apple at (8, 6) is to move RIGHT first to maintain horizontal distance from the enemy, then maneuver down. \n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 8) keeps the option open to go further right to (8, 8) or (9, 8), staying far away from the enemy's potential pathing while closing in on (8, 6).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1. Move RIGHT to (7, 8). \n2. Follow up by moving toward (8, 6). The path (7, 8) -> (8, 8) -> (8, 7) -> (8, 6) seems very safe and avoids any immediate head-on collisions with Snake #0.\n3. Once (8, 6) is collected, evaluate the board for the next apple, likely moving toward the right-side edge or the bottom-right apple at (9, 0).\n\nRIGHT",

However, Snake #0 is at (7, 6). If Snake #0 moves RIGHT, we will have a **head-on collision** at (8, 6). Since Snake #0 is significantly larger (12 apples vs 6), I must avoid risky head-on collisions unless necessary. However, if I take it and they move elsewhere, I grow. If both move there, we both die. Given I am behind in points, a double-death results in a loss.\n2. **RIGHT (9, 7):** Safe move. It moves me away from Snake #0's head. From (9, 7), I can potentially move DOWN to (9, 6) or (9, 0) later.\n3. **UP (8, 8):** **INVALID** (Backwards into body).\n4. **LEFT (7, 7):** Safe from my own body, but (7, 7) is adjacent to Snake #0's head at (7, 6). If they move UP, we collide.\n\n### Risk Assessment & Strategy:\nSnake #0 is likely targeting the apple at (8, 6). \n- If I move **DOWN**, and they move **RIGHT**, we both die.\n- If I move **RIGHT**, I stay alive and can react to their next move. \n- If Snake #0 takes the apple at (8, 6), they will be at (8, 6) with their tail moving. \n- The apple at (9, 0) is a long-term goal, but I need to navigate around the large body of Snake #0 occupying the middle-left.\n\nMoving **RIGHT** is the safest way to preserve the snake while staying close enough to contest the right side of the board.\n\n### Long-term Plan:\nAvoid the head-on collision at (8, 6) this turn. Move to the edge at (9, 7) to observe Snake #0's path. If they commit to the bottom-right, I will loop around the top or wait for an opening to head toward the clusters at (0, 0) and (0, 1).\n\nRIGHT",

It stays on the board and avoids bodies.\n2. **DOWN (9, 6):** Safe move. It brings me closer to the apple at (8, 6) and (9, 0).\n3. **LEFT (8, 7):** **INVALID** (Backwards into body).\n4. **RIGHT (10, 7):** **INVALID** (Off board).\n\n### Potential Risks:\nSnake #0 is at (7, 5). They have several options:\n- If they move **RIGHT** to (8, 5), they are preparing to take the apple at (8, 6).\n- If they move **UP** to (7, 6), they are following their own body.\n- If they move **DOWN** to (7, 4), they are moving toward the bottom.\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (9, 6), I am adjacent to the apple at (8, 6). \n- If Snake #0 moves to (8, 5) and I move to (9, 6), we are diagonally adjacent. \n- If I move **DOWN**, I am on the edge of the board, which limits my movement but keeps me away from the bulk of Snake #0's long body.\n\nThe apple at (8, 6) is contested. However, from (9, 6), I can decide whether to contest (8, 6) or continue down the wall to (9, 0). Since Snake #0's head is currently at (7, 5), they can reach (8, 6) in two turns. I can reach (8, 6) in two turns (via 9, 6 -> 8, 6). \n\nMoving **DOWN** is the most proactive move to secure the right-side apples or force Snake #0 to make a choice.\n\n### Long-term Plan:\nHead south along the 9-column. This positions me to either take (8, 6) if the opponent retreats, or to bypass them and go for the isolated apple at (9, 0). I must stay aware of Snake #0's head position to avoid being pinned against the right wall.\n\nDOWN",

To get there, moving DOWN is more direct. However, Snake #0 is at (7, 0). If it moves to (8, 0) and then (9, 0), it might reach it first or we might clash.\n- **Immediate Threat:** Moving to (8, 2) is safe.

Since Snake #0's head is at (7, 0), it is very close to (9, 0). If it contests (9, 0), I will pivot to the right wall (column 9) or head back up toward (9, 8).\n\nDOWN",

I'll move to the right-side wall (column 9). If Snake #0 moves to (9, 0), it will be momentarily trapped against the corner and its own body.
