Check for immediate death**  \n- UP (1, 2): Contains an apple, no snake body there currently. Safe unless Snake #1 moves there simultaneously.  \n- DOWN (1, 0): Empty cell, no body, inside board. Safe unless Snake #1 moves there simultaneously.  \n- LEFT (0, 1): Empty cell, inside board. Safe.  \n- RIGHT (2, 1): Empty cell, inside board. Safe.  \n\n**3. Consider Snake #1\u2019s possible moves**  \nSnake #1 head at (5, 3). Possible moves: UP (5,4), DOWN (5,2), LEFT (4,3), RIGHT (6,3).  \nNone of these overlap with my possible moves except in very indirect ways \u2014 no direct head-on collision possible this turn because Snake #1 is too far away.  \n\n**4. Apple proximity**  \nApples: (1, 2), (2, 0), (9, 3), (9, 0), (8, 0).  \nClosest apple to me: (1, 2) \u2014 directly above me.  \nUP (1, 2) gets me an apple immediately.  \n\n**5. Safety of UP move**  \nUP is safe:  \n- Not off board.  \n- Not into own body (I have no body yet).  \n- Not into Snake #1\u2019s body (Snake #1 body is empty).  \n- No head-on collision possible with Snake #1 this turn.  \n\n**6. Future options after each move**  \n- UP: After eating apple at (1, 2), my body will be longer (head at (1, 2), body at (1, 1)). Next turn I can go LEFT (0, 2), RIGHT (2, 2), DOWN (1, 1) \u2014 but DOWN would be into my new body segment, so not safe next turn. So 2 safe moves next turn.  \n- Other moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) don\u2019t get apple but leave me with 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nStill, eating apple early is good for growth and score. UP seems optimal.  \n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (1, 2), avoid moving back into (1, 1) next turn. Prefer LEFT or RIGHT to explore board and head toward other apples while avoiding trapping myself.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

That means Snake #1 grew, so its tail didn\u2019t move. Last turn it moved from head (9,0) to (8,0) and ate the apple there.\n\n**Apples** at: (2, 0), (1, 8), (8, 5), (0, 8), (5, 6) \u2014 wait, but check board: Apple at (5,6) is listed and also apple at (5,5)?? Let\u2019s reconstruct:  \nFrom board:  \nApple at (2,0), (1,8), (8,5), (0,8), (5,6) \u2014 yes, (5,5) has my head now, so no apple there. So only 5 apples on board.\n\n**Snake #1\u2019s possible moves** from (8,0):  \n- UP \u2192 (8,1): empty, safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off-board \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,0): empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,0): its own body segment (unsafe).  \nSo Snake #1 can go UP or LEFT.\n\nWhat\u2019s Snake #1 likely to do? Apples nearby:  \n- (2,0) far across the board, (8,5) is north. Might go UP to get closer to (8,5) eventually. But its immediate goal uncertain.  \n\n**My possible moves** from (5,5):  \n- UP \u2192 (5,6): apple there (safe; no snake body there now) \u2014 eating apple next turn.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,4): my body segment (unsafe) \u2192 eliminated.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,5): empty (safe).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,5): empty (safe).\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Collision risk with Snake #1 this turn:**\nSnake #1 head at (8,0). It can\u2019t reach my possible next positions in one move since they are far.\n\n**Other risk assessment**:  \nIf I go UP to eat apple at (5,6), I grow, my tail stays at (4,3), so I\u2019ll be length 5 next turn. That keeps my tail far away for now, so I won\u2019t trap myself quickly.\n\nAlso, going UP gets an apple and gets me closer to the apples at top left area (1,8) (0,8).\n\nLEFT or RIGHT don\u2019t give immediate apple.\n\n**Future moves after eating apple at (5,6):** next turn head at (5,6), body: [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (4,3)] \u2014 still relatively safe area, can go LEFT(4,6)/RIGHT(6,6)/DOWN(5,5) unsafe because body. So I'll have at least two moves typically.\n\nSo UP is clearly best: apple + safe.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating (5,6), head to top apples (1,8) or (0,8) via left side to avoid Snake #1, who\u2019s currently bottom right.  \nKeep checking Snake #1\u2019s likely path to the top apples to avoid head-on collision.\n\n---\n\nUP",
