The board is 10x10.\n\nMy immediate goal is to collect apples safely.\n\nApples are at: (8, 4), (7, 2), (4, 5), (8, 1), (2, 4), (5, 0), (6, 7), (3, 8), (1, 2), (9, 2), (1, 9), (8, 7), (8, 6), (3, 3), (0, 8).\n\nMy current position is (4, 2).\n\nSafe moves check:\n1. UP: (4, 3). Safe. Apple at (3, 3) is nearby. Apple at (4, 5) and (2, 4) are reachable.\n2. DOWN: (4, 1). Safe. Apple at (5, 0) is reachable.\n3. LEFT: (3, 2). Safe. Apple at (1, 2) is reachable.\n4. RIGHT: (5, 2). Safe. Apple at (7, 2) and (9, 2) are reachable.\n\nAll four moves are safe, as I have no body to hit, and none move off the 10x10 board. I also don't collide with Snake 0, which is far away at (7, 5). Its possible moves are (7, 6), (7, 4), (6, 5), (8, 5). None of these intersect with my immediate next moves.\n\nLet's evaluate proximity to apples:\n- (4, 2)\n  - UP to (4, 3). Next turn, I could go LEFT to (3, 3) and eat an apple. Total distance to (3, 3) is 1 move, but I need 2 turns (UP, then LEFT).\n  - LEFT to (3, 2). Next turn, I could go LEFT to (2, 2) or DOWN/UP. Apple at (1, 2) is 2 moves away.\n  - RIGHT to (5, 2). Next turn, I could go RIGHT to (6, 2) or further. Apple at (7, 2) is 3 moves away. Apple at (9, 2) is 4 moves away.\n  - DOWN to (4, 1). Apple at (5, 0) is 2 moves away (RIGHT, DOWN or DOWN, RIGHT).\n\nThe closest *eatable* apple in 2 turns is (3, 3) via UP, then LEFT.\n\nLet's look at apples reachable in D Manhattan distance:\nD=1: None.\nD=2:\n  - (3, 3): L1 distance is |4-3| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2. Achievable via UP then LEFT.\n  - (5, 0): L1 distance is |4-5| + |2-0| = 1 + 2 = 3. Wait, this isn't 2. (4 moves: DOWN twice then RIGHT, or RIGHT then DOWN twice, or DOWN then RIGHT then DOWN)\n  - (1, 2): L1 distance is |4-1| + |2-2| = 3.\n  - (5, 0) is L1=3.\n  - (2, 4) is L1=4.\n  - (7, 2) is L1=3.\n\nLet's re-evaluate (3, 3) which is 2 moves away.\nIf I move UP to (4, 3), I am 1 move from (3, 3). I can eat it on Turn 1 by moving LEFT.\n\nLet's check (1, 2). If I move LEFT to (3, 2), I am 2 moves from (1, 2). I can eat it on Turn 2 by moving LEFT, then UP/DOWN/LEFT.\n\nLet's check (7, 2). If I move RIGHT to (5, 2), I am 2 moves from (7, 2). I can eat it on Turn 2 by moving RIGHT twice. Wait, that's 3 moves total. (4, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (6, 2) -> (7, 2).\n\n(3, 3) is clearly the nearest apple reachable in 2 turns:\nT0: Move UP to (4, 3)\nT1: Move LEFT to (3, 3) (Eat apple)\n\nThis seems like the optimal first move.\n\nPlan: Move UP to position myself for eating the apple at (3, 3) on the next turn.\n\nFinal move choice: UP.\n\nNote to future self: Aim for (3, 3) next turn (LEFT).\n\nUP",

I still have no body segments (length 1).\n\n**Game State Summary:**\n*   **My Head:** (4, 3)\n*   **Target Apple (from T0 plan):** (3, 3) (Apple available)\n*   **Enemy Head (Snake #0):** (8, 5) (Assuming Enemy moved from (7, 5) or similar, but its T0 location was (8, 5) and mine was (4, 3) in the input for T1). Wait, checking T0 data: Enemy head was at (8, 5). Since this is Turn 1, the opponent's position (8, 5) is its *current* head position after its T0 move.\n\n*Checking T0 data again:*\nMy T0 location: (4, 3). My T0 move: UP. New location: (4, 3). No, wait.\nMy head was (4, 3) in the input for T1. This means (4, 3) *is* my position after the T0 move.\nThe input for Turn 1/150 indicates:\nYour snake (ID: 1): Head: (4, 3).\nThis means the move UP from (4, 2) succeeded, and I am now at (4, 3).\n\nApples are at: (8, 4), (7, 2), (4, 5), (8, 1), (2, 4), (5, 0), (6, 7), (3, 8), (1, 2), (9, 2), (1, 9), (8, 7), (8, 6), **(3, 3)**, (0, 8).\n\n**Goal for this Turn (T1):** Eat the apple at (3, 3).\n\n**1. Check Immediate Danger/Safety:**\nMy head is (4, 3). I must avoid (0-9, 0-9) boundaries, self-collision (impossible), and enemy body/head collisions.\nEnemy Snake #0 is at (8, 5). It is far away and poses no immediate threat.\n\n**2. Evaluate Moves from (4, 3):**\n\n*   **UP to (4, 4):** Safe. Moves towards (4, 5) apple (1 move away), (2, 4) apple (2 moves away).\n*   **DOWN to (4, 2):** Safe. Moves back to my T0 starting square.\n*   **LEFT to (3, 3):** **Eats Apple!** Safe move. This is the optimal move based on the T0 plan.\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 3):** Safe. Moves towards (7, 2) apple (3 steps away).\n\n**3. Optimal Choice:**\nMoving LEFT to (3, 3) successfully collects the closest apple, resulting in snake growth (length 2) and score increase (1 apple).\n\n**4. Enemy Projections (Snake #0 at (8, 5)):**\nSnake #0 can move to:\n*   (8, 6) [Apple]\n*   (8, 4) [Apple]\n*   (7, 5)\n*   (9, 5)\nNone of these moves affect my immediate apple acquisition at (3, 3).\n\n**5. Future Strategy Discussion (After Eating Apple):**\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 3), my head will be (3, 3) and my tail/body will be (4, 3).\nApples remaining near me:\n*   (4, 5): L1 distance 2 (U, R or R, U)\n*   (2, 4): L1 distance 2 (U, L or L, U)\n*   (2, 4) is potentially closer if I move L/U.\n\nLet's look at the proximity from (3, 3):\n*   (4, 5): (3, 3) -> (4, 3) [R] -> (4, 4) [U] -> (4, 5) [U]. 3 moves (R, U, U). Wait, L1 distance is |3-4| + |3-5| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n*   (2, 4): L1 distance is |3-2| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2. Achievable in 2 turns. (3, 3) -> (2, 3) [L] -> (2, 4) [U] (Eat). Or (3, 3) -> (3, 4) [U] -> (2, 4) [L] (Eat).\n\nThe next immediate target should be (2, 4).\n\nPlan for T2 (next turn): Target (2, 4) by moving UP or LEFT.\n\nThe move for T1 is definitively LEFT.\nLEFT",

(1, 2): L1 = |3-1| + |3-2| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n**Target Selection:**\nThe apple at (2, 4) is the closest and most accessible. I should aim to acquire it in the next 1-2 turns.\n\n**1. Safety Check (Moves from (3, 3)):**\n\n*   **Obstacles:**\n    *   Walls: (0, 0) to (9, 9)\n    *   My Body/Tail: (4, 3) (Tail)\n    *   Enemy Body: (8, 5)\n    *   Enemy Head: (8, 4)\n\n*   **Move UP to (3, 4):**\n    *   Safe?

Yes.\n    *   Leads to (2, 4): (2, 3) -> (2, 4) [U]. 2 moves total.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (4, 3):**\n    *   **DANGER!** This is my body/tail segment (4, 3). If I move R, I attempt to move into the space currently occupied by my tail, and since I just ate, this segment will *not* disappear this turn. Moving backward into your own body/tail is immediately fatal. **KILLED.**\n\n**2. Optimal Move Evaluation (Toward (2, 4)):**\n\nBoth UP to (3, 4) and LEFT to (2, 3) lead to an easy consumption of the (2, 4) apple next turn.\n\n*   **If UP to (3, 4):** Next turn, move LEFT to (2, 4) (Eat).\n*   **If LEFT to (2, 3):** Next turn, move UP to (2, 4) (Eat).\n\nBoth are equally good in terms of path efficiency. Let's choose the one that keeps me centralized, or sets up better for the next apple after (2, 4).\n\nIf I eat (2, 4), my head will be at (2, 4), body at (3, 3), (4, 3).\nFrom (2, 4), the next closest apples are:\n1.  (4, 5): L1 = |2-4| + |4-5| = 3.\n2.  (1, 2): L1 = |2-1| + |4-2| = 3.\n3.  (4, 6): L1 = 4.\n\nIf I move UP to (3, 4) first, I am slightly higher on the board, potentially favoring (4, 5) or (4, 6) later.\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 3) first, I am slightly more to the left, potentially favoring (1, 2) or (0, 8) later.\n\nGiven (2, 4) is the immediate goal, I'll choose UP, as it moves the tail (4, 3) further away from walls and keeps the snake body in a more centralized vertical line [(3, 4), (3, 3), (4, 3)] if the tail remains due to eating. Wait, if I move UP to (3, 4), my body becomes [(3, 4), (3, 3)]. My tail (4, 3) disappears *unless* I eat an apple, which I am not doing this turn. Since I ate last turn, my length is 2. My body is [(4, 3)].\n\nCurrent state: Head (3, 3), Body [(4, 3)]. Length 2.\nIf I move UP to (3, 4), no apple eaten:\nNew Head: (3, 4)\nNew Body: [(3, 3)]\nLength L = 2. Tail (4, 3) disappears.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 3), no apple eaten:\nNew Head: (2, 3)\nNew Body: [(3, 3)]\nLength L = 2. Tail (4, 3) disappears.\n\nBoth are safe and equally efficient for the next apple. I will choose UP just to generally move into the denser apple region in the upper-middle board.\n\n**3. Enemy Projection (Snake #0 at (8, 4), Body (8, 5)):**\nEnemy options:\n- (8, 3) [Safe, moves away from body]\n- (7, 4) [Safe]\n- (9, 4) [Safe]\nThe enemy is far away and not contesting (2, 4).\n\n**4. Final Decision:** UP.\n\n***\n**Future Strategy Note (For T3):**\nMove target is (2, 4). Next turn (T3), if current move is UP to (3, 4), move LEFT to (2, 4) to eat the apple. After eating (2, 4), look at (4, 5) and (1, 2). Current plan: UP.\n***\n\nUP",

Enemy Collision Check (Enemy Head at (6, 4), Body at (7, 4)):**\nThe enemy is 4 cells away (6, 4).\nPotential enemy moves:\n*   UP (6, 5): Safe, moves towards dense apple cluster (6, 7). L1 to (4, 5) is 3 (less favorable than my position).\n*   DOWN (6, 3): Safe.\n*   LEFT (5, 4): Safe, moves closer to my position.\n*   RIGHT (7, 4): DANGER (hitting tail).\n\nIf the enemy moves UP to (6, 5), they are safely moving away from my area (2, 4) and towards their own cluster.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 4), they are moving toward my target (4, 5).\nIf I move UP to (2, 5), the enemy is highly unlikely to reach (4, 5) before me, as I could then move RIGHT (3, 5 then 4, 5) or UP (towards 4, 6), keeping separation.\n\nLet's assume the enemy goes for the closest viable apple: (6, 7) or (4, 5).\n(6, 7) is L1=3. (4, 5) is L1=3.\nIf the enemy moves UP to (6, 5), they decrease distance to (6, 7) to 2, and distance to (4, 5) to 2.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 4), they decrease distance to (4, 5) to 1. This would mean they could eat it next turn.\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 5), my distance to (4, 5) becomes 2. I need two more moves (e.g., R, R) to reach it.\nIf I move UP to (2, 5): T5 I move R to (3, 5). T6 I move R to (4, 5) and eat.\nIf the enemy moves L to (5, 4): T5 they move L to (4, 4). T6 they move U to (4, 5) and eat.\nThis leads to a potential collision or race for (4, 5) if the enemy goes LEFT, but the apple (4, 5) is just slightly more favorable for me as (4, 4) is currently empty.\n\nAh, wait, if the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 4), they are 1 step away from (4, 5) via a UP move (5, 5) or RIGHT move (4, 4).\n(5, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 5) - 2 moves.\n(5, 4) -> (5, 5) -> (4, 5) - 2 moves.\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 5).\n(2, 5) -> (3, 5) -> (4, 5) - 2 moves.\n\nIf the enemy moves LEFT (5, 4) and I move UP (2, 5), we are both 2 moves away from (4, 5). However, I have more moves (3) to get there safely (U, R, R or U, L, D to (1, 4), (1, 3)). The enemy's closest path to (4, 5) is through (4, 4), which is currently free.\n\nGiven the potential race for (4, 5), and the fact that (1, 2) is entirely uncontested in the corner, I will re-evaluate moving toward (1, 2) which is also L1=3.\n\n**Re-evaluating based on Target (1, 2):**\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 3), I am 2 moves from (1, 2) (L, D or D, L).\nT5: (2, 3)\nT6: (1, 3) (or 2, 2)\nT7: (1, 2) (or 1, 2) [Eat]\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 4), I am 2 moves from (1, 2) (D, D).\nT5: (1, 4)\nT6: (1, 3)\nT7: (1, 2) [Eat]\n\nMoving LEFT to (1, 4) puts me on the clear path (1, 4) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 2).\nMoving DOWN to (2, 3) allows me more flexibility for the vertical/horizontal moves (2, 3) -> (1, 3) or (2, 2).\n\nThe spot (1, 4) is directly on the edge, but moving LEFT seems the most linear and safest way to acquire (1, 2) without worrying about the enemy.\n\nLet's stick with the LEFT move.\nNew position: (1, 4). Body: [(2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3)].\n\n***\n**Future Strategy Note (For T5):**\nI will be at (1, 4). Next target is (1, 2). Move DOWN to (1, 3).\nLength 3.\nThe enemy is likely moving into the central apple cluster (around 4, 5 or 6, 7).\n***\n\nLEFT",

(1, 2): L1 = |1-1| + |2-4| = 2.\n2. (0, 8): L1 = |0-1| + |8-4| = 1 + 4 = 5.\n3. (4, 5): L1 = |4-1| + |5-4| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n4. (7, 1): L1 = |7-1| + |1-4| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\n(1, 2) is the closest and uncontested.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves towards (1, 2):**\n\n1.  **Move DOWN to (1, 3):**\n    *   Perfect path towards (1, 2). Next move is DOWN to (1, 2) and eat.\n    *   L1 to (1, 2): 1.\n\n2.  **Move LEFT to (0, 4):**\n    *   Safe. Moves away from (1, 2) horizontally, requiring 3 moves total (L, D, D).\n    *   L1 to (1, 2): 3.\n\n3.  **Move UP to (1, 5):**\n    *   Safe. Moves away from (1, 2), requiring 3 moves total (U, D, D, D or zig-zag).\n    *   L1 to (1, 2): 3.\n\nMoving DOWN to (1, 3) is clearly the optimal move as it puts me 1 move away from eating the apple at (1, 2).\n\n**Enemy Collision Check (Enemy Head at (5, 4), Body at (6, 4)):**\nThe enemy is centered on the board.\nPossible enemy moves:\n*   UP (5, 5): Safe. Good path towards (4, 5) (L1=1) or (6, 7) (L1=3).\n*   DOWN (5, 3): Safe.\n*   LEFT (4, 4): Safe. Excellent path towards (4, 5) (L1=1).\n*   RIGHT (6, 4): DANGER (hitting own body).\n\nThe enemy's most likely targets are (4, 5) (L1=1) and (5, 0) (L1=4). (4, 5) is 1 move away if they go LEFT to (4, 4) and then UP to (4, 5) (if (4, 4) is empty this turn, they eat T+2). If they choose LEFT to (4, 4), they will be 4 units away from me and completely irrelevant to my position at (1, 3).\n\nI am moving DOWN to (1, 3). This move is entirely safe with respect to the enemy and guarantees the apple (1, 2) on the next turn.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note (For T6):**\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 3), I will eat apple (1, 2) next turn by moving DOWN again. This increases my length to 4. After eating (1, 2), I should evaluate the apples in the (0, 8), (3, 8), and (4, 5) region. The lower boundary (y=0) is free, so I have escape options.\n\nDOWN",

(I successfully ate the apple at (1, 2) last turn.)\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (4, 5). The enemy's previous body was [(5, 5), (5, 4)]. Since the board shows a '0' at (4, 5) and 'T' at (5, 5) and (5, 4), the enemy likely ate the apple at (4, 5) last turn, putting their head at (4, 5) and body at [(5, 5), (5, 4)]. This means their length is 3 and they have 2 apples (Score check confirms this).\n*   **Apples remaining:** (7, 2), (8, 1), (5, 0), (6, 7), (3, 8), (9, 2), (1, 9), (8, 7), (8, 6), (0, 8), (4, 6), (7, 7), (7, 1), (4, 8), (1, 5).\n\n**Immediate Surroundings of My Head (1, 2):**\n 3 . T . . .\n 2 . 1 . . .\n 1 . . . . .\n 0 . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4\n\n**Potential Moves from (1, 2):**\n*   UP: (1, 3) - Self Body segment (1, 3). **DANGER!** Moving backward into my own body.\n*   DOWN: (1, 1) - Empty. Safe.\n*   LEFT: (0, 2) - Empty. Safe.\n*   RIGHT: (2, 2) - Empty. Safe.\n\n**Safe moves:** DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Target Selection Strategy:**\nI have a significant lead (3 vs 2 apples) and I am near the bottom-left corner. The highest concentration of apples is in the upper half of the board (Y=5+). My goal should be to move North, ideally along the x=0 or x=1 boundary, to secure the apples at (0, 8), (1, 9), and potentially (1, 5).\n\n**Apple Distances (Manhattan Distance L1 from (1, 2)):**\n1.  (1, 5): L1 = |1-1| + |5-2| = 3. Very close.\n2.  (7, 2): L1 = |7-1| + |2-2| = 6. (Right)\n3.  (7, 1): L1 = |7-1| + |1-2| = 7. (Right/Down)\n4.  (0, 8): L1 = |0-1| + |8-2| = 7. (Up/Left)\n5.  (1, 9): L1 = |1-1| + |9-2| = 7. (Up)\n\nThe nearest apple is (1, 5) at L1=3. This is the optimal short-term target.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves towards (1, 5):**\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (1, 1):** Moves away from the target (1, 5). L1 increases to 4. Risky if forced further South.\n*   **Move LEFT to (0, 2):** Moves towards the boundary but parallel to the target (1, 5). L1 remains 4 (move to (0, 3) then (1, 5) or (0, 4) then (1, 5)). Not ideal for direct path but keeps the left boundary open.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (2, 2):** Moves away from the target (1, 5). L1 increases to 4. Less desirable.\n\nWait, if I want to reach (1, 5), the path is UP, UP, UP. Since UP is blocked by my body (1, 3), I need to move aside temporarily to allow my tail to vacate segment (1, 3) so I can continue moving up the column.\n\nMy body segments are (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4).\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 2):\nNew Head: (0, 2). New Body: [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]. Tail remains at (2, 4).\nNext turn (T8), the tail (2, 4) will still be occupied (since I eat nothing, length remains 4). The segment (1, 3) will become (T8) (1, 4). The segment (1, 2) will become (1, 3). The segment (0, 2) will be the head.\nWait, if I don't eat, the tail (2, 4) moves off the board, my new body is [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]. (1, 3) is then free for T8!\n\nLet's re-evaluate the tail movement:\nT7 Start: H(1, 2), B[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4)]. Length 4.\nMove LEFT to (0, 2). (No Apple)\nT8 Start: H(0, 2). Body: [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]. Tail (2, 4) is now free. (1, 3) is now occupied by a body segment.\n\nIf I want to go straight up the (1, Y) column, I need to vacate (1, 3). The only way to eventually reach (1, 3) is if I move to X != 1, and the tail (2, 4) leaves the snake, allowing the body segments to shift and free up (1, 3).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 2):\nT8 potential moves from H(0, 2):\n*   UP (0, 3): Safe.\n*   DOWN (0, 1): Safe.\n*   LEFT (-1, 2): Die.\n*   RIGHT (1, 2): Body segment occupied. DANGER: Self-collision.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 2):\nT8 potential moves from H(2, 2):\n*   UP (2, 3): Safe.\n*   DOWN (2, 1): Safe.\n*   LEFT (1, 2): Body segment occupied. DANGER: Self-collision.\n*   RIGHT (3, 2): Safe.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 1):\nT8 potential moves from H(1, 1):\n*   UP (1, 2): Body segment occupied. DANGER: Self-collision.\n*   DOWN (1, 0): Safe.\n\nAll three safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) lead to a difficult position next turn as the cell (1, 2) becomes occupied by my body, and the cell (1, 3) remains occupied. I need to move to a position that allows future UP movement easily, or bypasses the (1, 3) obstruction.\n\n**Strategy: Bypass (1, 3) and aim for (1, 5).**\n\n1.  Move LEFT to (0, 2). (Sets up movement along the X=0 boundary).\n    T8 H(0, 2), B[(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]. (1, 3) is blocked, (1, 2) is blocked.\n    From (0, 2), I can move UP to (0, 3).\n    T9 H(0, 3), B[(0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3)]. (1, 4) is free.\n    From (0, 3), I can move UP to (0, 4).\n    T10 H(0, 4), B[(0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2)]. (1, 3) is free.\n    From (0, 4), I can move RIGHT to (1, 4). (Body is at (0, 3)). Safe.\n    T11 H(1, 4), B[(0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2)]. (1, 4) is now 1 move away from (1, 5).\n    This path is 4 turns to get close to (1, 5). Total 5 moves.\n\n2.  Move RIGHT to (2, 2). (Sets up movement along the X=2 boundary).\n    T8 H(2, 2), B[(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]. (1, 3) and (1, 2) blocked.\n    From (2, 2), I can move UP to (2, 3).\n    T9 H(2, 3), B[(2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3)]. (1, 4) is free.\n    From (2, 3), I can move UP to (2, 4). **DANGER! (2, 4) is my body segment (1, 4) shifted.** Wait, (1, 4) doesn't shift here because the tail (2, 4) should have moved off.\n    Let's check the body list: H(1, 2), B[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4)].\n\n    *T7 Move RIGHT to (2, 2). No apple.*\n    T8 Head: (2, 2). New Body: [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]. Tail (2, 4) is vacant.\n    T8 Moves from (2, 2):\n    *   UP (2, 3): Safe.\n    *   DOWN (2, 1): Safe.\n    *   LEFT (1, 2): Body collision.\n    *   RIGHT (3, 2): Safe.\n    If T8 moves UP to (2, 3). No Apple.\n    T9 Head: (2, 3). New Body: [(2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3)]. Tail (1, 4) is vacant.\n    T9 Moves from (2, 3):\n    *   UP (2, 4): Safe (vacated by tail shift).\n    *   LEFT (1, 3): Body collision.\n    If T9 moves UP to (2, 4). No Apple.\n    T10 Head: (2, 4). New Body: [(2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2)]. Tail (1, 3) is vacant.\n    T10 Moves from (2, 4):\n    *   LEFT (1, 4): Safe! (1 move from (1, 5)).\n    *   UP (2, 5): Safe.\n    If T10 moves LEFT to (1, 4). No Apple.\n    T11 Head: (1, 4). New Body: [(2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2)]. (1, 2) is vacant.\n    T11 Moves from (1, 4):\n    *   UP (1, 5): **APPLE!** Reached in 4 moves, Eaten in 5 moves.\n\nThis path (RIGHT, UP, UP, LEFT, UP) is functional and targets the nearest apple.\n\n**Collision Check (Enemy Snake 0 at (4, 5)):**\nEnemy is far away (L1=6). They likely moved to (4, 5) last turn, eating an apple.\nNearby apples for Enemy 0: (4, 6) (L1=1), (6, 7) (L1=2), (8, 7) (L1=3).\nEnemy 0 next moves from (4, 5):\n1. UP to (4, 6) -> Eats apple (4, 6). (Most likely move).\n2. RIGHT to (5, 5) -> Hits own body (5, 5). DANGER.\n3. DOWN to (4, 4) -> Empty.\n4. LEFT to (3, 5) -> Empty.\n\nIf Snake 0 moves UP to (4, 6), they are still far from me and moving North-East. No immediate collision risk.\n\nThe move RIGHT is the best first step to maneuver around my body segment (1, 3) and head towards (1, 5).\n\n**Revised Long-Term Plan:**\n1. T7: RIGHT to (2, 2).\n2. T8: UP to (2, 3).\n3. T9: UP to (2, 4).\n4. T10: LEFT to (1, 4).\n5. T11: UP to (1, 5) (Eat apple).\n\nThis ensures I reach the closest apple safely and relatively quickly.\n\nRIGHT",

This plan aimed to bypass the segment (1, 3) which was blocking my straight path up.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves based on Plan:**\n1.  **Move UP to (2, 3):** This is the next step in the established plan to reach (1, 5) (L1=3 from (2, 2)). (2, 3) is safe.\n2.  **Move RIGHT to (3, 2):** This moves away from the target (1, 5). (L1 increases to 4).\n3.  **Move DOWN to (2, 1):** This moves away from the target (1, 5). (L1 increases to 4).\n\nMoving UP to (2, 3) is the optimal move to follow the pre-calculated safe path towards the nearest apple (1, 5).\n\n**Enemy Collision Check (Head at (4, 6)):**\nThe enemy is now at (4, 6) with body [(4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4)].\nPotential moves for Enemy 0 from (4, 6):\n*   UP: (4, 7) - Empty. (Good move to reach (4, 8) or other high apples).\n*   DOWN: (4, 5) - Body collision. DANGER.\n*   LEFT: (3, 6) - Empty.\n*   RIGHT: (5, 6) - Empty.\n\nThe enemy is focusing on the central/upper board area, completely separated from my current path in the bottom-left corner. No immediate head-on collision danger.\n\n**Confirming Path Safety (My body):**\nIf I move UP to (2, 3):\nNew Head: (2, 3). New Body: [(2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3)]. Tail (1, 4) is vacated.\nNext Turn (T9) my potential move to (2, 4) will be safe, as (1, 4) is now the tail and will move off the board if I don't eat.\n\nThe plan holds: Move UP.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Check (T9 - T11):**\n*   T8 (Now): UP to (2, 3).\n*   T9: Move UP to (2, 4) (Safe, as (1, 4) is vacated by tail shift).\n*   T10: Move LEFT to (1, 4) (Safe, as (1, 3) is vacated by tail shift).\n*   T11: Move UP to (1, 5) (Eat apple).\n\nThis path is solid.\n\nUP",

It is positioned centrally high up.\nIt is likely targeting (3, 8) (apple L1=1) or (0, 8) or (1, 9).\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 4), I hug the west wall.\nIf I move UP to (2, 5), I enter the main board area more, which is slightly higher risk if Snake 0 decides to sweep left.\n\nSince both moves are equally optimal for immediate apple capture, I will choose the one that executes the established plan and keeps me slightly more contained towards the wall, minimizing potential interaction with the large Snake 0 that is currently performing well.\n\nPlan execution: Move LEFT to (1, 4).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T11 - T13):**\n*   T10 (Now): Move LEFT to (1, 4).\n*   T11: Move UP to (1, 5) (Eat apple).\n*   T12: Evaluate next target, likely (0, 8) or (1, 9), depending on Snake 0's movements.

Moving directly onto my neck is safe *if* I grew (which I did, because I ate an apple). However, the rules state \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" Since I grew by 1, (1, 4) is now the second segment of my body, and I still die if I move into it (this rule applies regardless of growth). **FATAL.** (Wait, the clarification on snake bodies in various sources is complex. In this specific game environment, usually moving onto the immediate previous space is fatal because the *body* has not yet shifted. Let's assume standard rules where moving into the cell occupied by the *first segment* of your body is fatal, even if you just ate and the tail hasn't moved yet.) (1, 4) is occupied by my body. **FATAL, AVOID.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 5):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (0, 5) is empty and on board.\n    *   Apples? No immediate apple.\n    *   Leads towards (0, 8) (Apple) and (0, 3) (Apple).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 5):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (2, 5) is empty and on board.\n    *   Apples? No immediate apple.\n    *   Moves me closer to the center, potentially blocking Snake 0, but also getting closer to its body segments (2, 4) is T. (4, 5) is T. (3, 7) is Head 0. (2, 4) is also part of MY body.\n        *   Wait, let's re-examine my body coordinates: [(1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3), (2, 2)].\n        *   (2, 4) is my second body segment. Moving right to (2, 5) is safe, but moving to (2, 4) is fatal.\n\n**Summary of Safe Moves:** UP (1, 6), LEFT (0, 5), RIGHT (2, 5).\n\n**Strategy/Long Term Goal:** Grab nearby apples (0, 8) or (0, 3) to keep pace with Snake 0.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **UP (1, 6):** Moves me closer to the high-value cluster (0, 8) and (1, 9).\n*   **LEFT (0, 5):** Also moves me towards the left edge and towards (0, 8) and (0, 3).\n*   **RIGHT (2, 5):** Moves me across Snake 1's path and closer to Snake 0 territory. This seems less safe and less direct to an apple.\n\nIf I go UP to (1, 6), the next turn I can evaluate (0, 6) or (1, 7).\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 5), the next turn I can evaluate (0, 6) or (0, 4).\n\nLet's prioritize the upper left area where (0, 8) and (1, 9) are located.\n\nIf I choose UP:\nT12: (1, 5) -> (1, 6)\nT13 options: (0, 6), (2, 6), (1, 7). (1, 7) is empty. (0, 6).\nFrom (1, 7), I can easily hit (0, 8).\n\nIf I choose LEFT:\nT12: (1, 5) -> (0, 5)\nT13 options: (0, 6), (0, 4), (1, 5) [my body, likely fatal if I didn't grow, but I just grew, so 1, 5 is the head's previous spot].\nIf I move down from (0, 5) to (0, 4), I can then hit (0, 3).\nIf I move up from (0, 5) to (0, 6), I can then hit (0, 7) -> (0, 8).\n\nBoth UP and LEFT seem equally viable for apple collection in the short term (2-3 moves).\n\nHowever, moving UP keeps me along a clear column and gives me good access to the (1, 9) apple as well. Moving LEFT gets me to the very edge, which sometimes limits options.\n\nLet's examine Snake 0's potential moves from (3, 7):\nHead 0: (3, 7)\nNeck 0: (3, 8)\n1. UP to (3, 8): Fatal (Neck).\n2. DOWN to (3, 6): Safe. Moves toward center bottom.\n3. LEFT to (2, 7): Safe. Moves closer to me, but also potentially towards my body at (2, 4).\n4. RIGHT to (4, 7): Fatal (Body segment).\n\nSnake 0 safe moves: DOWN (3, 6) or LEFT (2, 7). Snake 0 has apples at (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7). It will likely move RIGHT/UP eventually to grab those. But moving RIGHT is blocked at (4, 7).\n\nIf Snake 0 moves DOWN (3, 6): It targets the lower right apples.\nIf Snake 0 moves LEFT (2, 7): It threatens the central space and potentially restricts my movement if I stay low.\n\nSince Snake 0 is constrained for upward movement and has many apples to the E/NE, it might try to weave around or go DOWN and then W/E.\n\nMy path UP (1, 6) seems orthogonal to Snake 0's immediate threats and leads directly to valuable apples. It avoids the congested center-left area where Snake 0 might pivot if it moves LEFT to (2, 7).\n\nI will move UP to target (0, 8) and (1, 9).\n\n**Short-Term Plan:** Move UP to (1, 6), then proceed to (1, 7) or (0, 6) depending on board status, aiming for the (0, 8) or (1, 9) apple.\n\nUP",

Neck 0: (3, 7).\n        *   Options for Snake 0: UP (3, 7 - Fatal), DOWN (3, 5 - Safe), LEFT (2, 6 - Safe), RIGHT (4, 6 - Fatal, Body segment).\n        *   Snake 0 has safe moves DOWN and LEFT. Snake 0 is still slightly constrained due to its body configuration.\n        *   If Snake 0 moves LEFT to (2, 6), a collision happens. Given Snake 0 is currently in the lower middle and has a path UP/RIGHT cleared relatively far away, and there's an apple at (5, 0), (7, 2), (8, 1), it might want to continue moving DOWN towards the bottom row apples.\n        *   However, (2, 6) is an open path towards the center/left, and Snake 0 might try to cut me off.\n        *   Moving RIGHT to (2, 6) carries significant collision risk (50% chance they move LEFT, based on their safe moves). Let's treat this as high risk. **AVOID.**\n\n**Summary of Safe and Low-Risk Moves:** UP (1, 7), LEFT (0, 6).\n\n**Comparing UP and LEFT:**\n\nBoth moves lead towards the apples at (0, 8) and (1, 9).\n\n*   **Move UP (1, 7):** Position (1, 7) allows me to either move LEFT (0, 7) or UP (1, 8) on the next turn. (1, 8) is very close to (1, 9) (Apple). (0, 7) would set up for (0, 8) (Apple). This bifurcation is strategically useful.\n*   **Move LEFT (0, 6):** Position (0, 6) is against the wall. Next safe moves: UP (0, 7) or DOWN (0, 5). This commits me more firmly to the left edge. If I go (0, 6) -> (0, 7) -> (0, 8) (A), I get that apple in 3 steps.\n\nLet's look at UP:\n(1, 6) -> (1, 7) (1 move)\nIf I go UP again: (1, 7) -> (1, 8) (2 moves). (1, 9) is Apple. If I target (1, 9), I get it in 3 moves total.\nIf I go LEFT: (1, 7) -> (0, 7) (2 moves). (0, 8) is Apple. I'd get it in 3 moves total.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT yield an apple in 3 moves, depending on the subsequent path chosen. However, UP (1, 7) keeps me one step away from the wall, offering slightly more flexibility if Snake 0 tries to move up the 2-column or 3-column. Snake 0 is currently at (3, 6) and is heading toward the bottom or the center. Even if Snake 0 tried for the (0, 8) apple, it would take them 5-6 moves and require coming past me or around my body.\n\nMoving UP (1, 7) is a strong choice as it directly sets up the attack on the top-left apples while maintaining distance from Snake 0.\n\n**Strategic Note:** Continue moving towards the high-scoring northern apples ((1, 9), (0, 8)) using the clear path up the Y=1 column.\n\nUP",

Empty cell.\n    *   This is the fastest path towards Apple (1, 9) (1 move away after this, total 2 moves).\n    *   Also maintains connectivity to Apple (0, 8). Extremely desirable move.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 6):**\n    *   Safe? **DANGER.** (1, 6) is my neck segment. Moving backwards is fatal. **FATAL, AVOID.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 7):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. Empty cell.\n    *   This is a good move towards Apple (0, 8) (1 move away after this, total 2 moves).\n    *   Slightly more constraining as it places me against the left wall.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 7):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. Empty cell.\n    *   This moves away from the primary target zone. It is safe, but less optimal strategically.\n    *   (2, 8) is a body segment (T), blocking further upward movement if I were to go RIGHT.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (UP and LEFT):**\n\n*   **Move UP (1, 8):** Positions me perfectly near the corner apple (1, 9) AND keeps open the option to move LEFT to (0, 8) in two turns if Snake 0 decides to move up the 1-column. Both are open.\n*   **Move LEFT (0, 7):** Positions me perfectly near the wall apple (0, 8). This is also excellent.\n\nSince both (1, 9) and (0, 8) are 2 moves away from the current position via safe, optimal paths, I should evaluate which path provides more flexibility or leads to a higher concentration of apples.\n\n*   If I choose **UP to (1, 8)**, the next move UP hits (1, 9) (Apple).\n*   If I choose **LEFT to (0, 7)**, the next move UP hits (0, 8) (Apple).\n\nBoth are equally fast acquisitions. The area around (1, 9) is: (0, 9). (2, 9). (1, 8). The area around (0, 8) is: (0, 9). (0, 7). (1, 8).\n\nSnake 0 is far away at (3, 5) and seems to be targeting the bottom of the board. There is no immediate interference risk in the upper-left corner.\n\nI prefer **UP** to (1, 8) because it allows for easy access to the (1, 9) apple and keeps (0, 8) as a strong follow-up target via the cell (0, 8) itself (which is an apple) or moving later to get (0, 9). Furthermore, if I move to (1, 8), I am still one step away from the wall, retaining marginally better movement options than moving immediately to (0, 7).\n\nLet's confirm Snake 0's location (3, 5). They are likely heading towards (5, 0), (7, 1), (8, 1), (7, 2), or (9, 2). My movement UP is uncorrelated with their expected movement.\n\nI will move UP towards (1, 9).\n\nUP",

(1, 9) is an Apple ('A').\n    *   **Result:** Eats an apple, grows, score increases to 5. Highly desirable.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 7):**\n    *   Safe? **DANGER.** (1, 7) is my neck segment. Moving backwards is fatal. **FATAL, AVOID.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 8):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (0, 8) is an Apple ('A').\n    *   **Result:** Eats an apple, grows, score increases to 5. Highly desirable.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 8):**\n    *   Safe? **DANGER.** (2, 8) is a segment of my body (denoted T on the board, but based on my body list: [(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4)] - (2, 8) is actually an empty spot on the board, but the map shows 'T' at (2, 8). Let's re-examine the board state and my body list.\n    *   My body: (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4). None of these are (2, 8).\n    *   Enemy body: [(3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8)]. None of these are (2, 8).\n    *   Conclusion: The 'T' at (2, 8) on the map must belong to Snake 0 based on the board visualization provided, even though the text description of Snake 0's body does not include (2, 8). Given the board visualization (9 A 1 . T T A...), the cell (2, 8) is occupied by *some* snake body. Since it's not mine, it must be the enemy's (T). **Therefore, moving RIGHT to (2, 8) is FATAL.**\n\n*Self-Correction on Board Visualization/Enemy Body:* I must trust the board visualization showing 'T' at (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5). The text description for Snake 0's body is [(3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8)]. This matches 5 segments. The board has 7 'T' segments: (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4) [My Body] and (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8) [Enemy Body]. That makes 9 segments total, but the board shows 'T' at (2, 8) and maybe others I miscounted.\nList of 'T' cells on the board:\n(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4) - My body (4 segments)\n(2, 8) - T\n(3, 8) - T\n(3, 7) - T\n(3, 6) - T\n(3, 5) - T\nWait, let's map the enemy body (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8): 5 segments.\nOn the board:\nRow 8: A 1 . **T** **T** A . . . . -> (2, 8) is T, (3, 8) is T.\nRow 7: . T . **T** . . A A A A -> (1, 7) is T, (3, 7) is T.\nRow 6: . T . **T** . . . . A . -> (1, 6) is T, (3, 6) is T.\nRow 5: . T . **T** . . . . . . -> (1, 5) is T, (3, 5) is T.\nRow 4: . T . 0 . . . . . A -> (1, 4) is T.\n\nThis means the full set of T segments shown are:\n(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4) [My 4 segments]\n(3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8) [Enemy 5 segments]\nCell (2, 8) is shown as 'T' on the board visualization. This cell is NOT in my body list nor the enemy body list provided *textually*. Since I must use the board state provided: if (2, 8) is 'T', I cannot move there.\n\n**Final Conclusion on Move RIGHT:** The board visualization indicates 'T' at (2, 8). Regardless of which snake owns it, moving into 'T' kills me. **AVOID.**\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (UP and LEFT)**:\nBoth are apples, leading to a score of 5 (tying Snake 0).\n\n*   **Move UP to (1, 9):**\n    *   Eats apple.\n    *   Next potential target is (0, 9) (empty) or perhaps turning down the wall. It places me in the corner.\n*   **Move LEFT to (0, 8):**\n    *   Eats apple.\n    *   Next potential target is (0, 9) (empty) or (0, 7) (empty). It places me against the left wall.\n\nIf I move UP to (1, 9), I've secured the corner. The next turn, I can move LEFT to (0, 9) and then DOWN to (0, 8), perhaps setting up a path to (0, 3).\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 8), I've secured the wall. The next turn, I can move UP to (0, 9) and then RIGHT to (1, 9).\n\n(1, 9) is on the top edge, (0, 8) is one step from the left edge. Either choice leads to an apple and allows access to the *other* apple on the subsequent turn or two.\n\nI prefer **UP to (1, 9)**. It takes the absolute corner apple first, which is often a good secure move. If I move UP, I am setting up for the subsequent move around the perimeter.\n\n(1, 8) -> UP -> (1, 9) [Eats A]\nNext turn, Head at (1, 9).\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 9), I am still near (0, 8).\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 8), I hit my body (now (1, 8) will be my neck).\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 9), it's open.\n\nSince (1, 9) is an Apple, and the path is safe, I will choose UP.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Focus on clearing the dense cluster of apples in the upper left (1, 9), (0, 8), (0, 3). Snake 0 is still far away in the bottom half of the board.\n\nUP",

My snake length is now 6 (5 body segments, 1 head).\n*   **My Body (ID 1):** [(1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4)].\n*   **Apples Collected:** 5. (Tied with Snake 0).\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (4, 4).\n*   **Enemy Body (ID 0):** [(3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)]. Note: The enemy tail is (3, 8). The previous turn's body list for Snake 0 was [(3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8)]. It seems Snake 0 moved from (3, 4) to (4, 4), consuming an apple, as its body shifted and grew, replacing (4, 8) with the new tail (3, 8) if it grew, or (4, 8) was not an apple and the body just moved. Since its score remained 5, and the body list is 5 segments long, it either ate an apple and moved, or just moved. Given the body shift: (3, 4) -> (4, 4). Old head (3, 4), new head (4, 4). The new body segments are (3, 4), (3, 5), ..., (3, 8). This is 5 segments. If it grew, the tail would be (4, 8) which is not listed. If it moved without eating, the tail (4, 8) should have disappeared, and the new tail is (3, 8). Let's trust the current state list: 5 segments.\n\n**Nearest Apples to My Head (1, 9):**\n1.  (0, 8) - 2 steps away (LEFT, DOWN OR DOWN, LEFT)\n2.  (5, 8) - 4 steps away\n3.  (0, 3) - 6 steps away\n\n**Current Board Visualization near (1, 9):**\n 9 . 1 . . A . . . . .\n 8 A T . T . A . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n(0, 9) is empty.\n(1, 9) is my head (1).\n(2, 9) is empty.\n(0, 8) is Apple (A).\n(1, 8) is my neck (T).\n\n**Evaluation of Potential Moves from (1, 9):**\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 10):**\n    *   Fatal. Off the board.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 8):**\n    *   Fatal. Into my neck segment.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 9):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (0, 9) is empty ('.').\n    *   **Result:** Safe passage. This sets me up perfectly to grab the apple at (0, 8) next turn.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 9):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (2, 9) is empty ('.').\n    *   **Result:** Safe passage. This moves me away from the apple cluster I was prioritizing (0, 8, 0, 3).\n\n**Decision:**\nI need to secure the apple at (0, 8). Moving LEFT to (0, 9) is the cleanest way to set up for this.\n\n*   If I move LEFT to (0, 9): Next turn (0, 9) -> (0, 8) (Eat A). This is a guaranteed apple sequence.\n*   If I move RIGHT to (2, 9): Next turn I'd have to turn DOWN to (2, 8). Looking at the board, (2, 8) is marked 'T' (snake body). Last turn, I concluded (2, 8) was occupied by the enemy snake or unknown snake body. If (2, 8) is still occupied, moving RIGHT is inefficient as it leads me potentially into a blockade or away from current targets.\n\nLet's re-verify the status of (2, 8).\nThe enemy body list is [(3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8)]. (2, 8) is not in this list.\nMy body list is [(1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4)]. (2, 8) is not in this list.\nThe board visualization shows: `8 A T . T . A . . . .`\nT at (1, 8). . at (2, 8). T at (3, 8).\n\nWAIT. I must re-read the board state provided in the input, carefully aligning coordinates:\n...\nBoard state:\n 9 . 1 . . A . . . . .\n 8 A T . T . A . . . .\n...\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nAt Y=8:\nX=0: A\nX=1: T (My body (1, 8))\nX=2: . (Empty) <-- **NOT 'T' like I thought in the previous rationale.**\nX=3: T (Enemy body (3, 8))\nX=4: .\nX=5: A\n\nMy analysis from the previous turn was flawed due to a misreading of the board visualization *in the rationale section*. I relied on the textual coordinates for safety. Let's look at the current board visualization: (2, 8) is now empty ('.').\n\nSo, if I move RIGHT to (2, 9):\n*   (2, 9) is empty. Safe.\n*   Next turn: I could move DOWN to (2, 8), which is now empty.

Turn 16: Move LEFT to (0, 9).\n2.  Turn 17: Move DOWN to (0, 8) and eat the apple.\n3.  Turn 18: Move towards (0, 3). Snake 0 is still far away controlling the middle/bottom of the board.\n\nLEFT",

Since (0, 7) was not an apple, my tail will move from (1, 6) to (1, 7).\n\n**Checking for Enemy Collisions:**\nEnemy snake 0 is at (7, 4) and cannot reach (0, 6) in one turn. No head-on collision risk.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategy Update):**\n1.  Turn 19: Move DOWN to (0, 6).\n2.  Turn 20: From (0, 6), the next target is the apple at (0, 5). The only viable move will likely be DOWN again, as (1, 6) will be part of my body. If (0, 5) is reached, I will extend my lead and then continue toward (0, 3).\n\nDOWN",

Into my own body. (Backwards move)\n\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 2):**\n    *   (0, 2) is an empty cell.\n    *   **Safety Check:** Safe.\n    *   **Result:** Safe, but moves me perpendicular to the desired path (rightwards) and away from the closest apple (5, 0).\n\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 3):**\n    *   Fatal. Off the board.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 3):**\n    *   (1, 3) is an empty cell.\n    *   **Safety Check:** Safe.\n    *   **Result:** This is the intended path to move right across the board towards (5, 0) and the other right-side apples. It maintains distance from my body. Excellent move.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nMoving RIGHT to (1, 3) implements the established plan to head towards the right side of the board where there are many apples, starting with (5, 0). All other safe moves (only DOWN) either kill me or are inefficient.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategy Update):**\n1.  Turn 23 (Current): Move RIGHT to (1, 3).\n2.  Turn 24: Move RIGHT to (2, 3), continuing movement across the board.\n3.  Turn 25-27: Continue moving right (3, 3), (4, 3), then turn down/right to acquire (5, 0).\n4.  After (5, 0), I will target the next closest available cluster, likely (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (7, 2), (9, 2). I need to ensure my tail at the far upper left doesn't trap me. Since my length is 9, I have room to maneuver for a few more turns before the tail (initially at (1, 8)) becomes an immediate threat near my path.\n\nRIGHT",

Given its proximity to apples, it will likely move to (7, 6), (9, 6) (if it goes down/right it might hit its own body), or UP towards (8, 7) or (9, 7). No matter what it does, it doesn't affect my current move.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nMoving RIGHT to (2, 3) is the most direct and efficient way to execute the long-term plan: traverse the bottom of the board toward the abundant apples on the right side.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategy Update):**\n1.

If board space permits, moving (5, 3) then (5, 2), (5, 1) then (5, 0) is safer than immediately turning down. Let's aim to get to (5, 0) and then attack the (X, 1) and (X, 2) clusters.\n\nRIGHT",

Less optimal for progress.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 2):**\n    *   (2, 2) is currently empty.\n    *   **Safety Check:** Safe.\n    *   **Result:** Safe. Maintains a path parallel to the bottom wall and sets up for moving right toward (5, 0). (2, 2) and (3, 2) are good spots.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 3):**\n    *   (1, 3) is occupied by my body (neck).\n    *   Fatal (moving backward).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 3):**\n    *   (3, 3) is currently empty.\n    *   **Safety Check:** Safe.\n    *   **Result:** This continues the established path toward the apple clusters and the center of the board. This is the most direct path toward (5, 0).\n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 0) Movement Consideration:**\nHead at (8, 7). It could go:\n*   UP to (8, 8) (Empty, safe).\n*   RIGHT to (9, 7) (Apple A). Very likely.\n*   DOWN to (8, 6) (Body). Fatal.\n*   LEFT to (7, 7) (Apple A). Likely.\n\nSnake 0 is far away and currently consuming apples in the top right. Its movement does not pose an immediate threat.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nThe strategy is to continue moving RIGHT along the bottom of the board to spread out and position for the apple cluster around (X, 0), (X, 1), and (X, 2). Moving RIGHT to (3, 3) is the safest and most efficient continuation of this plan.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategy Update):**\n1.  Turn 25 (Current): Move RIGHT to (3, 3).\n2.  Turn 26: Move RIGHT to (4, 3).\n3.  Turn 27: Move DOWN to (4, 2) or RIGHT to (5, 3). Given the apple (4, 1) nearby, and (5, 0) slightly further, aiming for (4, 3) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 1) seems like a good local apple chain, potentially followed by (5, 1) -> (5, 0).\n\nRIGHT",

However, no immediate apple, and it might drift away from the dense cluster of apples nearby (e.g., (9,7), (7,7), (6,7), (7,9)).\n- DOWN: To (8,6) - this is directly into my own body (the next segment), invalid, die.\n- LEFT: To (7,7) - contains apple at (7,7), safe (empty cell + apple, no collisions), follows last-turn plan to eat this apple. Eating it advances me to 9 apples immediately, gaining a point lead on the enemy temporarily. After this move, the body will shift accordingly (tail moves from (5,4) to (6,4)), freeing some space. Strong follow-up options: e.g., LEFT again from (7,7) to (6,7) for another apple eat (safely reachable), or UP to (7,8) to keep elevated options toward row8 apples like (5,8)\u2014this maintains access to the east-side apple cluster without trapping myself, unlike RIGHT which we'll see is riskier.\n- RIGHT: To (9,7) - contains apple at (9,7), safe (empty cell + apple, no collisions), also eats for 9 apples. However, after this move, options get limited fast: from (9,7), only UP to (9,8) is safe (DOWN hits my body at (9,6), LEFT hits my shifted body at (8,7), RIGHT off-board). That forces a narrow path to (9,8), which could trap me in the top-right corner with enemy potentially expanding leftward (its head at (2,3) could move RIGHT or UP this turn to approach col3-4 eventually, closing in), and reduces future apple accessibility near the cluster.\n\nAll snakes move simultaneously, but given enemy is far (head at (2,3), no likely head-on collisions this turn\u2014no enemy move reaches near (7,7), (9,7), or (8,8) in one step), and no obvious board edges hit. No part of my current body blocks these moves; enemy body is all in col0, aligning with the left wall, so no overlaps.\n\nEvaluated options: Eating apples maximizes score growth (currently tied at 8 apples; leaping to 9+ keeps pace and pressures enemy). LEFT aligns perfectly with last-turn strategy, eats (7,7), leaves flexible paths (can turn LEFT again for (6,7) or zig southward right for other apples), avoids bottlenecks (RIGHT leads to potentially dead-end at (9,8)), and doesn't deviate from aggressive apple-eating near the board's right side. UP is safe but no eat, lesser.\n\nOverall decision: Pri talking LEFT to eat (7,7), gain the apple lead, and support short-term loops for 9+ apples in 1-2 more turns before enemy can counter.\n\nLeft: To (7,7) for apple, score 9; next turn LEFT to (6,7) eat if safe for +10, keeping east row7-8 paths open and monitoring enemy push left (aim west if row7-8 apples thin and enemy nears col4+; 10-15 apples in 3turns to dominate early)..LEFT",

It brings me closer to the bottom row apples (4, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0) and maintains clearance from my main body mass on the left.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 3):**\n    *   (2, 3) is occupied by my body (neck).\n    *   Fatal (moving backward).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 3):**\n    *   (4, 3) is currently empty.\n    *   **Safety Check:** Safe.\n    *   **Result:** This is also a strong move. It continues the progress to the right. From (4, 3), I can move DOWN to (4, 2) then (4, 1) [Apple] or (4, 0) [Apple].\n\n**Comparing DOWN and RIGHT:**\n*   Moving RIGHT to (4, 3) sets up a direct path to the apples at (4, 1) and (4, 0) via (4, 2).\n*   Moving DOWN to (3, 2) also sets up a path to (4, 1) or (4, 0) by moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nThe path 3,3 -> 4,3 -> 4,2 -> 4,1 (Apple) seems slightly more direct to securing the first apple, (4, 1), requiring 3 moves.\nThe path 3,3 -> 3,2 -> 4,2 -> 4,1 (Apple) also requires 3 moves.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 3), I maintain distance from the left wall, which is largely comprised of my own body. This keeps my expansion horizontal before dipping down, offering more flexibility.\n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 0) Consideration:**\nHead at (7, 7). It is far away and preoccupied with the upper right corner apples (A at 6, 7; A at 9, 7; A at 7, 9).\nPossible moves for Snake 0:\n*   UP to (7, 8) (Empty, safe).\n*   RIGHT to (8, 7) (Body T). Fatal.\n*   DOWN to (7, 6) (Empty, safe).\n*   LEFT to (6, 7) (Apple A). High probability move.\n\nNo immediate threat of collision.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 3) is the best choice to continue expanding my territory and positioning myself for the upcoming apples, especially (4, 1) and (4, 0), which are close to the center-bottom of the board.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategy Update):**\n1.  Turn 26 (Current): Move RIGHT to (4, 3).\n2.  Turn 27: Move DOWN to (4, 2).\n3.  Turn 28: Move DOWN to (4, 1) (Apple).\n4.  Turn 29: Move DOWN to (4, 0) (Apple).\n5.

Leader in score without advancing it; keeps board-wide options open, avoiding leftward commitment.\n- DOWN to (7,6): Empty cell (row 6, col 7: .). No apple eat. Puts me lower/more central, but reduces immediate apple access (denser apples are mid-right board). Follow-ups: LEFT to (6,6, empty), RIGHT to (8,6, empty\u2014 WAIT, (8,6) is own body: body list includes (8,6), so RIGHT from (7,6) to (8,6) hits body, invalid. UP to (7,7 error, back into head/external invalid). So very limited: only DOWN further or LEFT. Risks getting boxed in without eats. Weak choice.\n- LEFT to (6,7): Empty cell + apple (row 7, col 6: A, apple (6,7)). Safely eats for 10 apples (2-point lead). Alters body (new segment inserts at old head (7,7) after move, length 10\u219211, tail (5,4) stays put per rules). Follow-up positions: UP to (6,8, empty), DOWN to (6,6, empty), LEFT to (5,7, empty\u2014row 7, col 5: . , unsafe? Wait, safe: no body there). RIGHT blocked by new body at (7,7). Eats now while near row 7-9 apple cluster; supports last-turn plan to chain eats for max apples (aiming 10-15 in 3 turns).\n\nPriorities: Avoid death (none here), eat apples to build unassailable lead (need 50 total to win early), maintain future flexibility. All moves safe from collisions/head-ons. LEFT best: immediate eat +1, aligns with aggressive apple focus for early domination. UP safer long-term (evades left-side traps) but no eat, delaying score growth. DOWN lowest value. Enemy's row 0 wall/growth suggests leftward expansion soon\u2014pinning to mid-board is risky if I go too far left without eats.\n\n**Short-term plan for next few turns:** After LEFT eat (6,7) for 10 apples, assess: If row 7-8 remains flexible (e.g., UP to (6,8) for loop toward (5,8 apple at row 8 col 5), or DOWN to reposition if needed), continue apple chains eastward/upward for 11-13. Monitor enemy push (likely RIGHT from (3,3) toward col 4+); if it nears, hover mid-board defensively. Goal: Hit 50 apples before enemy catches (currently 9:8, but I'm growing faster).\n\nLEFT",

The current body listed is the state *after* the move from (3, 3) to (4, 3), meaning the old tail (0, 8) has vanished. The body list provided must be the current state: [(3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)]. Length is 8. Wait, length was 9 before, if the old tail (0, 8) vanished, the new length is 9 (head + 8 body segments). Let's re-verify the body length based on the turn 26 state:\n    *   T26 Head: (3, 3). Body: [(2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)]. Length 9.\n    *   T27 Head: (4, 3). Body: [(3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)]. Length 9. (0, 7) is the new tail. This is consistent.\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (6, 7).\n*   **Enemy Body (ID 0):** [(7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4)]. Length 11. (Enemy ate an apple? No, enemy score went from 9 to 10. Yes, enemy ate an apple last turn. Location of consumed apple: (6, 7) was an apple location.)\n*   **Apples at:** (7, 2), (8, 1), (5, 0), (9, 2), (7, 1), (9, 7), (5, 8), (4, 9), (7, 9), (9, 1), (3, 7), (1, 5), (4, 1), (4, 0), (1, 4).\n*   **Score:** I have 8 apples, Enemy has 10 apples.

Move DOWN to (4, 1) (Apple).\n3.  Move DOWN to (4, 0) (Apple).\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 4):**\n    *   (4, 4) is occupied by Enemy Body (T).\n    *   Fatal.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 2):**\n    *   (4, 2) is currently empty.\n    *   **Safety Check:** Safe.\n    *   **Result:** This stays on plan, moving me one step closer to two adjacent apples at (4, 1) and (4, 0).\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 3):**\n    *   (3, 3) is occupied by My Body (neck).\n    *   Fatal (moving backward).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 3):**\n    *   (5, 3) is currently empty.\n    *   **Safety Check:** Safe.\n    *   **Result:** This moves me horizontally. From (5, 3) I could go DOWN to (5, 2) then to (5, 1) or (5, 0) [Apple]. This path is viable but takes an extra turn compared to the path starting with DOWN if I target (4, 1) first.\n\n**Collision Check (Head 1 vs. Head 0):**\nMy next possible moves: (4, 2), (5, 3).\nEnemy Head 0 at (6, 7). Enemy previous move was likely into (6, 7) (Apple).\nPossible moves for Head 0:\n*   UP to (6, 8) (Empty, safe).\n*   DOWN to (6, 6) (Empty, safe).\n*   LEFT to (5, 7) (Empty, safe).\n*   RIGHT to (7, 7) (Body T). Fatal.\n\nNo risk of head-on collision or the enemy intercepting my immediate target area (y=0 to y=2).\n\n**Decision Analysis:**\nThe goal is to secure (4, 1) and (4, 0) quickly. Moving DOWN to (4, 2) sets me up perfectly for the next two turns to collect these apples.\n\nPath:\nT27: (4, 3) -> DOWN -> (4, 2)\nT28: (4, 2) -> DOWN -> (4, 1) (Apple, Grow)\nT29: (4, 1) -> DOWN -> (4, 0) (Apple, Grow)\n\nThis is the most efficient apple-grabbing sequence available.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategy Update):**\n1.  Turn 27 (Current): Move DOWN to (4, 2).\n2.  Turn 28: Move DOWN to (4, 1) (Apple).\n3.  Turn 29: Move DOWN to (4, 0) (Apple).\n4.

Enemy head at (4,3), distant\u2014no immediate collision risk this turn regardless of move, as simultaneous moves unlikely to align heads. Board open around head: UP (6,8) empty, LEFT (5,7) empty, DOWN (6,6) empty; RIGHT (7,7) own neck/body invalid. Apple's apple cluster accessible: (5,8 at (5,8)) reachable in two moves.\n\nPossible safe moves:\n- UP to (6,8): Empty cell. No immediate eat, but advances toward (5,8; path: this UP, next LEFT eats it, grows length 10\u219211, tail static at (5,4)). Also positions higher near row9 apple cluster ((7,9 at (7,9)); potential chain via (5,8)\u2192UP to (5,9)\u2192LEFT to (4,9 eat)). Keeps mid-right board wide open (follow-ups: LEFT, RIGHT (7,8 empty), or further UP (6,9 empty if possible)). Aligns with last-turn plan for upward chain to 11-13 apples, evading potential left-side enemy expansion. Leader position strengthened without stalling growth; row8 open allows safe loops/repositions if enemy shifts right.\n- LEFT to (5,7): Empty cell. No immediate eat. Path to (5,8): this LEFT, next UP eats it. But moves left-poised, unpredictable enemy advance at (4,3) could close in (enemy likely expanding right/up, e.g., UP to (4,4) or RIGHT to (5,3)); less flexibility than UP (from (5,7): LEFT to (4,7 empty), DOWN to (5,6), RIGHT invalid; narrower vs. row8 expanse). Still viable for apple chain but risks getting mid-left if chases without grows\u2014UP better for sustained lead.\n- DOWN to (6,6): Empty cell. No eat, lowers toward board center/middle apples. Very limited follow-ups (LEFT (5,6) or RIGHT (7,6) empty, but UP backtracks, DOWN potentially boxes in near own body at row4-5). Worst choice: delays apple growth, tightens options, encourages no-score turns vs. accessible (5,8).\n\nAll moves safe from death/off-board/self-hit/body-hit/head-on. Prioritize apples/flexibility: UP advances apple-focused plan (chain to (5,8) then row9 like (7,9)), offers 3 strong follow-ups (LEFT eat, RIGHT open, UP open), avoids left-trap risk. LEFT eats same path but starts lower, more vulnerable to enemy (e.g., if RIGHT to (5,3)). DOWN eats nothing, restrictive. Enemy's bottom-wall growth suggests rightward mobility\u2014keep high for defense/offense.\n\n**Short-term plan for next few turns:** After UP to (6,8) toward (5,8 eat for 11 apples), evaluate: If (5,8) eatable (LEFT next turn), do so, then prioritize row9 chain (e.g., from (5,8) UP to (5,9)\u2192LEFT to (4,9 eat for 12\u219213) or RIGHT cycles). Monitor enemy (likely UP/RIGHT growth toward mid-board); if nears (e.g., col5+), DOWN to mid-reposition defensively. Goal: Chain 5-8 apples next 5 turns for 15-18, widen lead before enemy hits 10+; win early at 50 if possible.\n\nUP",

This is the most likely offensive move, as the enemy is currently apple-focused.\n*   RIGHT to (7, 8) (Empty, safe).\n*   DOWN to (6, 7) (Body T). Fatal.\n\nThe enemy is far away and does not pose any collision risk in the bottom-middle section of the board.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving DOWN to (4, 1) is the immediate priority, as it is an apple and perfectly safe. This continues the executed plan to quickly secure the stack of apples at (4, 1), (4, 0), and then potentially (5, 0).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategy Update):**\n1.  Turn 28 (Current): Move DOWN to (4, 1) (Apple).\n2.  Turn 29: Move DOWN to (4, 0) (Apple). (My head will be at (4, 1))\n3.  Turn 30: Move RIGHT to (5, 0) (Apple). (My head will be at (4, 0))\n4.  Turn 31: Move UP to (5, 1) or (6, 0) if (5, 0) wasn't an apple, depending on other apple locations (e.g., (7, 2), (7, 1), (8, 1)).\n\nDOWN",

Enemy head at (4,2), no risk of collision this turn (possible enemy moves: DOWN (4,1), LEFT (3,2), RIGHT (5,2)\u2014all safe from hitting me). Reachable apples: (5,8) via LEFT, (7,9) via RIGHT then UP if needed, but (5,8) is immediate. Board mostly open; no tight spaces near head.\n\nSafe moves (no death/off-board/self-hit/collisions):\n- UP (6,9): Empty, moves to row9 but no eat; follow-ups: LEFT (5,9), RIGHT (7,9 eat); flexible, positions higher near (4,9)/(7,9), but delays scoring.\n- LEFT (5,8): Into apple, grow to 11 apples (grow length 10\u219211, tail at (6,4) stays); follow-ups from (5,8): UP (5,9), LEFT (4,8); directly achieves last-turn plan to eat (5,8), gains point fast, chains to row9 later.\n- RIGHT (7,8): Empty; follow-ups: UP (7,9 eat), RIGHT (8,8); also allows immediate eat next turn for 11, similar chain potential but shifts right.\n\nPrioritize eating to widen lead and follow prior plan: LEFT eats instantly, boosts to 11 vs 8, keeps multiple options open (3 follow-ups) while chaining toward row9 apples ((4,9 next via UP/LEFT). RIGHT eats same, but LEFT aligns with upward path quoted last turn (\"move toward (5,8; path: ... LEFT eats it\"). UP safer longer-term but not as aggressive. Enemy unlikely to block soon\u2014monitor next turn.\n\n**Short-term plan for next few turns:** After LEFT eat to (5,8) for 11 apples, chain UP to (5,9), then LEFT to (4,9) eat for 12\u219213; avoid down else closer to enemy. If enemy shifts right/up (e.g., to col5), reposition LEFT/DOWN defensively. Target 12-15 apples in 3-4 turns; enemy at 8 could chase bottom cluster, but lead first. Adapt if enemy eats (rows0-2 apples: (4,0),(5,0),(4,1),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1)\u20146 possible quickly, but stay mid-high for safety/rows7-9 apples).\n\nLEFT",

Moving DOWN to (6, 8) hits the third segment of the body. Fatal.)\n\nIt is highly likely Enemy #0 moves RIGHT to (7, 9) to grab that apple.

My current snake length is 12.\n*   **My Neck (ID 1):** (5, 0).\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (7, 9).

I am down by 1.\n\n**Board Visualization near My Head (5, 1):**\n\n 9 . . . . A T 0 . .\n ...\n 4 T A . . . A . . T T\n 3 T T T T T . . . . .\n 2 . . . . T . . A . A\n 1 . . . . T H .

I am targeting the high-density apple region in the southeast.\n\n**Evaluation of Potential Moves from (5, 1):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 2):**\n    *   (5, 2) is occupied by My Body, the segment (5, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (4, 1) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 5). Wait, let's re-examine my body list: [(5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)].\n    *   The board shows T at (5, 2). Looking at the board state provided:\n        `2 . . . . T . . A . A` -> T is at (4, 2).\n        Let's check the coordinates of my body segments:\n        (5, 0) - OK (Neck)\n        (4, 0) - T\n        (4, 1) - T\n        (4, 2) - T\n        (4, 3) - T\n        (5, 2) is EMPTY. The board shows `.` at (5, 2).\n    *   **Safety Check:** Safe.\n    *   **Result (UP):** Leads towards the center and apples (5, 4), (5, 6). Good option for flexibility, but slightly slower getting to the dense cluster (7, 1), (8, 1), etc.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 0):**\n    *   (5, 0) is occupied by My Body (Neck).\n    *   Fatal (moving backward).\n\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 1):**\n    *   (4, 1) is occupied by My Body.\n    *   Fatal.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 1):**\n    *   (6, 1) is currently empty.\n    *   **Safety Check:** Safe.\n    *   **Result (RIGHT):** This quickly advances toward the major apple cluster ((7, 1) is an apple, (8, 1) is an apple, (9, 1) is an apple) and keeps me near the wall, minimizing exposure to Enemy #0, who is far away at (7, 9). This aligns perfectly with the strategic goal of clearing the southeast corner first.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 1) is the best choice. It directly pursues the dense cluster of apples in the right/bottom corner, helping me catch up to Snake #0's score.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Head 0 at 7, 9):**\nEnemy #0 likely just ate the apple at (7, 9). Its neck is (6, 9).\nPossible moves for Head 0 (7, 9):\n*   UP to (7, 10): Off board. Fatal.\n*   DOWN to (7, 8): Apple (A). Optimal.\n*   LEFT to (6, 9): Neck. Fatal.\n*   RIGHT to (8, 9): Empty, but leads to apple (9, 7) or (8, 8).\n\nSnake #0 will almost certainly move DOWN to (7, 8) to grab the next available apple. This maintains distance between us.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategy Update):**\n1.  Turn 32 (Current): Move RIGHT to (6, 1). (Head at (6, 1)).\n2.  Turn 33: From (6, 1), I will likely move RIGHT again to (7, 1) to eat an apple.\n3.  Turn 34: Continue capitalizing on the dense apple cluster in the southeast before moving north if necessary.\n\nRIGHT",

Invalid.\n- DOWN: To (7,8), in bounds, no snake body (confirmed not in my or enemy body lists), no apple, but opens path to apple at (8,8) via RIGHT next turn while keeping some flexibility. Safe.\n- LEFT: To (6,9), directly backwards into own neck (previous head position), die. Invalid.\n- RIGHT: To (8,9), in bounds, no snake body (none present there), no immediate apple but opens paths to adjacent apples like (8,8) via DOWN or (9,7) via RIGHT then DOWN-DOWN, with multiple future options (DOWN, RIGHT, even potential LEFT loops if careful). No head-on collision risk. Safe.\n\nPreferred for keeping multiple follow-up options open while progressing toward clustered apples in x=8-9 range and keeping distance from enemy trajectory (likely staying left/low).\n\nShort-term plan: Go DOWN next turn from (8,9) to eat (8,8) and grow to 13 apples, maintaining lead. From (8,8), shift toward (9,7) apple via RIGHT then DOWN or other safe shifts; if enemy threatens, veer defensively via UP or path back left if safe. Avoid tight spots near top row. Adjust based on enemy next moves toward left apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Turn 33 (Current): Move RIGHT to (7, 1) and eat an apple. (Head at (7, 1), score 12).\n2.  Turn 34: From (7, 1), continue along the dense apple cluster, likely moving RIGHT to (8, 1) (Apple) or UP to (7, 2) (Apple).

Eats an apple, maintains the pursuit along the bottom/corner, and directly addresses the score deficit.\n\n**Comparison (UP vs. RIGHT):**\nBoth UP and RIGHT eat an apple immediately.\n*   Moving RIGHT to (8, 1) positions me well for (9, 1) next turn (another apple).\n*   Moving UP to (7, 2) positions me well for either RIGHT to (8, 2) (empty) or UP/DOWN.\n\nSince the goal is to maximize apple collection quickly in this dense area, moving along the wall (RIGHT, then 9, 1) is slightly more direct and guarantees two apples in two turns, provided no obstacles.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 1):\nNext turn (T35), I will be at (8, 1). Apples are at (9, 1) and (7, 2). I would move RIGHT to (9, 1).\n\nIf I move UP to (7, 2):\nNext turn (T35), I will be at (7, 2). Apples are at (8, 1) and (9, 2). I could move RIGHT to (8, 2) (empty, then to 9, 2) or DOWN/RIGHT to (8, 1).\n\nRIGHT seems the most expedient path for maximum score gain immediately.\n\n**Collision Check:**\nEnemy 0 is at (8, 8). It could move (7, 8), (9, 8), (8, 9), or (8, 7). None of these moves interfere with my move to (8, 1). The risk of collision is zero.\n\n**Decision:** Move RIGHT to (8, 1) to eat the apple.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategy Update):**\n1. Turn 34 (Current): Move RIGHT to (8, 1) (Eat apple, Score 13).

My current snake length is 14 (Head + 13 Body segments).\n*   **My Body:** [(7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4)].\n*   **Enemy Head (ID 0):** (9, 8). Snake 0 moved to (9, 8) last turn. Its body is now [(8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5)]. Length 14. Note: I assume Snake 0 moved RIGHT from (8, 8) to (9, 8) and ate an apple (there was an apple at (9, 8) according to T34 apple list, though (9, 8) is now marked as 0). Wait, the T34 state showed Apple at (8, 1) and (9, 1), and Enemy 0 was at (8, 8). If Enemy 0 moved, it likely moved from (8, 8) to (9, 8). Looking at the board: (9, 8) is marked '0'. If it moved there, it must have eaten an apple, as its length is 14 and mine is 14.\n*   **Apples at:** (7, 2), (9, 2), (9, 7), (4, 9), (9, 1), (3, 7), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 7), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (5, 3), (2, 2).\n*   **Score:** I have 13 apples, Enemy #0 has 13 apples. The score is tied.\n\n**Board Visualization near My Head (8, 1):**\nMy goal is still to sweep the high-density apple region in the southeast corner: (9, 1), (7, 2), (9, 2).\n\n 9 . . . .

Wait, checking the board state visual: (8, 2) is marked 'A'. This is confusing. Let me check the provided apple list. (8, 2) is *not* in the apple list. However, (8, 1) was an apple I just ate. Let's re-examine the coordinates against the board diagram and the apple list.\n    *   Apple List: (7, 2), (9, 2), (9, 7), (4, 9), (9, 1), (3, 7), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 7), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 0), (5, 3), (2, 2).\n    *   Board Diagram at (8, 2): Looks like 'A'. Let's trust the coordinate list first. (8, 2) is NOT listed. The diagram must be misinterpreted or have a typo, or perhaps the diagram uses 'A' for something other than the current remaining apples. Considering row 2: `2 . . A . T . . A . A`. This means (2, 2), (7, 2), (9, 2) are apples. Wait, (8, 2) is missing from the diagram. The diagram shows: (7, 2) is the second 'A' in that row, (9, 2) is the third 'A' in that row. The slot (8, 2) is empty (.).\n    *   Let's move based on the provided apple list and the state diagram where it is unambiguous based on my current location:\n        *   (7, 1) is T (body).\n        *   (9, 1) is A (Apple).\n        *   (8, 2) is empty (.).\n        *   (8, 0) is empty (.).\n    *   **Move UP to (8, 2):** Empty space. Safe. Leads towards (7, 2) or (9, 2) next.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 0):**\n    *   (8, 0) is empty (.).\n    *   **Safety Check:** Safe.\n    *   **Result (DOWN):** Moves away from the dense apple cluster. Not ideal.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 1):**\n    *   (7, 1) is occupied by My Body (Neck).\n    *   Fatal (moving backward).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 1):**\n    *   **Move RIGHT to (9, 1):** (9, 1) is an Apple (A).\n    *   **Safety Check:** Safe. No self-collision risk. Enemy is far away (9, 8).\n    *   **Result (RIGHT):** Optimal move. Eats another apple immediately, taking the lead and continuing the sweep strategy.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe move RIGHT to (9, 1) is the highest priority as it directly results in an apple and furthers the cleaning of the bottom right corner region.\n\n**Collision/Trap Check:**\nEnemy 0 is at (9, 8), far away. Its possible moves (UP to (9, 9) [T], DOWN to (9, 7) [A], LEFT to (8, 8) [T]) do not obstruct me.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategy Update):**\n1. Turn 35 (Current): Move RIGHT to (9, 1) (Eat apple, Score 14). Head at (9, 1).\n2. Turn 36: From (9, 1), move UP to (9, 2) (Apple, Score 15). Head at (9, 2).\n3. Turn 37: From (9, 2), assess moving LEFT towards (8, 2) (empty) or (7, 2) (Apple). Likely LEFT to (8, 2), then UP/LEFT to (7, 2), consolidating the bottom corner apples effectively.\n\nRIGHT",

No. This move itself is safe, growth occurs, points to 14 (extending lead on enemy at 13), but follow-up moves from (9,7) are impossible (all adjacent cells occupied by own body or invalid), leading to certain death on the next turn.\n- LEFT to (8,8): Into own body (the neck segment directly behind head). Dies immediately.\n- RIGHT to (10,8): Out of bounds. Dies immediately.\n\nBoth non-lethal options (UP and DOWN) trap the snake and lead to death, but DOWN utilizes an immediate apple for growth and potential edge in apples if all snakes die simultaneously (win condition if apples higher). UP does not gain the apple and leaves apples tied or behind. Prioritize DOWN per strategy (increase chance of eating apples safely, though short-term).\n\nLong-term plan: Continue cautiously; next position (9,7) will be fatal next turn, but boost apples now for possible simultaneous endgame win. Monitor enemy movements for any head-on or collision opportunities, but focus on survival if somehow viable (unlikely here).\n\nDOWN",

Fatal.\n*   Move DOWN (9, 6): Collision with body segment (9, 6)? Yes. Fatal.\n*   Move LEFT (8, 7): Collision with body segment (8, 7)? Yes. Fatal.\n\nThis means Snake 0 has only one safe move available: it must have died or there is an error in my analysis/input processing, as (9, 7) should be surrounded by its body except for one exit.\n\nLet's re-examine the body coordinates relative to H0 (9, 7):\nNeck: (9, 8) -> UP is impossible.\nBody segments near (9, 7): (9, 6) is a segment. (8, 7) is a segment. (10, 7) is off board.\nIt appears Snake #0 has surrounded itself and will die this turn unless I am misreading the board data.\n\nLet's assume the provided body data is correct:\nHead (9, 7). Neighbors:\n(9, 8) -> Body (Neck). CRASH.\n(9, 6) -> Body (Segment 12, after (8, 6)). CRASH.\n(8, 7) -> Body (Segment 11, after (7, 7)). CRASH.\n(10, 7) -> Off board. CRASH.\n\nIf my analysis is correct, Snake #0 will self-destruct this turn. I must ensure I do not self-destruct.\n\n**My Decision:**\nMove UP to (9, 2). This secures an apple and further increases my lead. Since Snake #0 appears to be trapped, this move is completely safe regardless of Snake #0's fate.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Strategy Update):**\n1. Turn 36 (Current): Move UP to (9, 2) (Eat apple, Score 15). Head at (9, 2).\n2. Turn 37: From (9, 2), move LEFT to (8, 2) (empty) or possibly UP to (9, 3) (empty). Since (7, 2) is the next apple, LEFT to (8, 2) is the preferred path to continue sweeping the south-east area.\n3. Turn 38: Move LEFT to (7, 2) (Apple).\n\nUP",
