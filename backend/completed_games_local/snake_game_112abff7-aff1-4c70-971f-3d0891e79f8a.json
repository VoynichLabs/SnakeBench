Moving RIGHT eats it immediately, growing to length 2 with tail at (5,3).  \n\n**Enemy consideration:** Enemy at (4,9) is far away, no immediate collision risk.  \n\n**Future safety after eating apple:**  \nIf I eat (6,3), my body will be [(6,3), (5,3)] next turn.  \nFrom (6,3), possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (6,4) \u2013 empty  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,2) \u2013 empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,3) \u2013 my own tail (but tail will move if I don\u2019t grow again) \u2014 careful: next turn after eating, tail stays at (5,3) for one more move before moving? Wait, rules: when you eat an apple, you grow by 1 segment immediately, so after moving to apple, your length increases, but tail doesn\u2019t move that turn. Next turn, when you move, tail moves forward (so old tail cell becomes empty). So after eating at turn 2, at start of turn 3 my snake is length 2, head at (6,3), tail at (5,3). On turn 3, if I move, tail moves to (6,3)? No \u2014 tail movement: each turn the head moves forward, each body segment moves into the previous segment\u2019s old position, so tail moves to where the 2nd segment was. Actually, let's simulate:  \n\nTurn 2 start: head (5,3), body none.  \nTurn 2 move RIGHT to (6,3) (apple). After move: head (6,3), body (5,3). Length 2.  \n\nTurn 3 start: head (6,3), body (5,3).  \nIf I move UP to (6,4) on turn 3: new head (6,4), body becomes [(6,4), (6,3)], tail (5,3) disappears. So (5,3) becomes free.  \n\nThus, moving LEFT from (6,3) to (5,3) on turn 3 would be safe because (5,3) will be empty after tail moves.  \n\nSo eating apple now is safe and gives growth.  \n\n**Other apples:** After (6,3), next closest is (7,3) at distance 1 from (6,3), so could go RIGHT again next turn to eat it if safe.  \n\n**Plan:**  \nEat (6,3) now \u2192 length 2. Next turn from (6,3) consider eating (7,3) if enemy not threatening, else go UP/DOWN to explore.  \n\nRIGHT is the only move that eats apple now, others just move toward apples more slowly.

Let\u2019s check:  \nTurn 0: length 2.  \nTurn 1: ate apple \u2192 length 3.  \nTurn 2: ate apple \u2192 length 4.  \nYes, length 4 now. But body shown is only [(6, 3), (5, 3)] after head (7, 3). That\u2019s 3 segments total. That means one segment is missing from the list? Let\u2019s check:  \nFrom last turn rationale, I moved from (6,3) to (7,3) and ate apple.  \nBefore that move, my body was [(5,3)] (length 2). After eating, length becomes 3, so body should be [(6,3), (5,3)] plus head (7,3) \u2192 total 3 segments. But apples collected = 2 means I\u2019ve eaten 2 apples total, starting length 2 \u2192 total length 4.  \nHmm, discrepancy. Let\u2019s trust the given data:  \nApples collected: 2.  \nBody listed: [(6,3), (5,3)] after head (7,3) \u2192 that\u2019s 3 segments total.  \nMaybe they count apples collected but length growth is delayed by one turn? Or maybe they show body before growth from last apple? Actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, you grow at the end of the turn, so next turn your tail doesn\u2019t move. But here they show body after head move but before growth? No \u2014 they say \u201cYour snake (ID: 1): Head: (7,3) Body: [(6,3), (5,3)]\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s the current state after last turn\u2019s move and growth. That\u2019s length 3, not 4. So maybe starting length was 1? Let\u2019s check earlier: Turn 0 length 2. If I ate 2 apples, length should be 4. Something\u2019s off.  \n\nLet\u2019s ignore and just use given coordinates:  \nMy segments: (7,3) head, (6,3), (5,3) tail.  \n\n**Possible moves from (7,3):**  \nUP \u2192 (7,4) \u2013 empty on board.  \nDOWN \u2192 (7,2) \u2013 empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (6,3) \u2013 my own body segment (neck). Illegal (would die).  \nRIGHT \u2192 (8,3) \u2013 empty.  \n\nAll except LEFT are safe from immediate self-collision.  \n\n**Enemy snake #0:** head (5,8), body [(5,9)].  \nIt could move in any direction. Possible head positions next turn: (5,7), (5,9) (its own tail, safe if tail moves), (4,8), (6,8). None overlap with my possible moves except maybe if it goes to (6,8) and I go to (7,4) etc \u2014 no direct collision possible this turn since I\u2019m at y=3, enemy at y=8.  \n\n**Apples:** (2,2), (1,6), (0,0), (0,9), (1,0).  \nClosest apple to me is (1,6) or (2,2). (1,6) is 5 Manhattan distance, (2,2) is 6 distance.  \n\n**Future safety:**  \nFrom (7,3):  \n- If I go UP to (7,4), next turn my body will be: head (7,4), then (7,3), (6,3), tail (5,3) moves off? Wait, length 3 means after moving without eating, tail disappears, body becomes [(7,4), (7,3), (6,3)]. So (6,3) still occupied.  \nFrom (7,4), possible moves: UP (7,5), DOWN (7,3) (body segment), LEFT (6,4), RIGHT (8,4). So DOWN blocked.  \n\nSimilarly, from (7,2): body next turn: [(7,2), (7,3), (6,3)], so UP to (7,3) blocked next turn.  \n\nFrom (8,3): body next turn: [(8,3), (7,3), (6,3)], so LEFT blocked next turn.  \n\nSo all moves block one direction next turn, but that\u2019s normal.  \n\n**Plan:**  \nI want to move toward nearest apple while keeping options open.  \n(1,6) is at y=6, x=1. From (7,3), going UP gets closer in y.  \n(2,2) is at y=2, x=2, so DOWN gets closer in y but farther in x.  \n\nLet\u2019s check safety of UP: (7,4) is safe now. Next turn from (7,4), I can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN blocked). That\u2019s fine.  \n\nEnemy is far, no immediate threat.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose UP to approach (1,6) while staying in open area.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Also avoids moving toward the right where my tail was.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 4), check enemy position and choose between DOWN or LEFT to continue toward (2, 2).

I\u2019ll be at (1, 1) and can eat (1, 0) before enemy reaches it.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (1, 6), it\u2019s far away.  \n\nLEFT to (0, 2) reduces my safe moves and doesn\u2019t get me closer to (1, 0) than DOWN does.  \nUP moves away from closest apple.  \n\nBest: DOWN to (1, 1) to grab (1, 0) next turn while keeping options open.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn**  \nAfter moving to (1, 1), apples left: (1, 6), (0, 0), (1, 0), (3, 9), (3, 5).  \nEnemy likely at (0, 5) or (1, 6).  \nFrom (1, 1), eat (1, 0) if safe (check enemy possible moves to (1, 0) or adjacent). If enemy threatens, maybe go LEFT to (0, 1) or UP to (1, 2) to avoid head-on.  \nGoal: secure (1, 0), then consider (0, 0) or (3, 5).  \n\nDOWN",

If I go RIGHT, I create distance but lose pressure on the bottom half. \n\nThe most efficient move to stay in the game for the cluster of apples is DOWN. Snake #1's body currently blocks their own movement options to the left/bottom-left, so they are likely to head for (4, 2) or (8, 1). By moving DOWN, I remain flexible to challenge (4, 2) or shift to (0, 3).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nPursue (4, 2) if Snake #1 doesn't take it immediately.

If enemy moves DOWN to (4, 2) and I move UP to (4, 3), we swap positions, no collision. If enemy moves LEFT/RIGHT and I move UP to (4, 3), I occupy empty cell (since enemy left it). So UP is not an immediate death from collision with enemy head this turn? Wait, rule: If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both die. That means if enemy chooses to move DOWN to (4, 2) and I choose UP to (4, 3), we move to different cells, fine. If enemy chooses LEFT to (3, 3) and I choose UP to (4, 3), I go to (4, 3) which is now empty (enemy left it), fine. So UP is not a guaranteed head-on collision. But there\u2019s a risk: if enemy stays at (4, 3) (by moving UP to (4, 4) which is illegal, so enemy cannot stay), so enemy must move. So UP is safe from immediate death? Let\u2019s check board boundaries: (4, 3) is within board. Not my body (my body is at (4, 1), (3, 1), etc.). So UP is not obviously lethal.  \n\n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 1) \u2013 my own body \u2192 illegal.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 2) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 2) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Enemy possible moves from (4, 3)**  \nEnemy safe moves:  \nUP (4, 4) \u2013 own body \u2192 illegal.  \nDOWN (4, 2) \u2013 my current head (but I will move away) \u2192 not enemy\u2019s body, so allowed for enemy.  \nLEFT (3, 3) \u2013 empty.  \nRIGHT (5, 3) \u2013 empty.  \nSo enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Collision risk this turn**  \nIf I go UP to (4, 3): enemy cannot be there at turn end because enemy must move. So no head-on collision unless enemy moves into (4, 3) from elsewhere? Enemy can only move 1 step, so from (4, 3) to (4, 3) is impossible. So safe.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 2): enemy could move DOWN to (4, 2) or LEFT/RIGHT, no overlap.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 2): enemy could move RIGHT to (5, 3) or DOWN/LEFT, no overlap.  \n\nSo all three moves are safe from immediate collision.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nApples: (0, 0) blocked by my body, (0, 3) far, (3, 9) far, (8, 1) far, (8, 8) far.  \nNo apple adjacent this turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Future safety after each move**  \nIf UP to (4, 3):  \nNew body: head (4, 3), then (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0) \u2014 tail (1, 1) disappears (since no apple eaten).  \nFrom (4, 3): UP (4, 4) enemy body (danger next turn if enemy leaves?), but enemy body currently at (4, 4), but enemy will move this turn, so (4, 4) might become empty if enemy moves away. Actually enemy\u2019s body after moving: if enemy moves DOWN to (4, 2), its body becomes [(4, 3), (4, 4), \u2026] so (4, 4) still occupied. If enemy moves LEFT to (3, 3), its body becomes [(4, 3), (4, 4), \u2026] so (4, 4) still occupied. So (4, 4) likely occupied next turn. So UP from (4, 3) next turn is risky.  \nDOWN (4, 2) my body (will be my neck), LEFT (3, 3) possibly enemy head if enemy moves there this turn? Wait, enemy could be at (3, 3) if it moves LEFT. So LEFT could be dangerous. RIGHT (5, 3) possibly empty. So next turn from (4, 3) could be tight.  \n\nIf LEFT to (3, 2):  \nNew body: head (3, 2), then (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0) \u2014 tail (1, 0) disappears.  \nFrom (3, 2): UP (3, 3) possibly enemy head if enemy moves LEFT to (3, 3) this turn. DOWN (3, 1) my body, LEFT (2, 2) empty, RIGHT (4, 2) my body. So only LEFT is certainly safe next turn.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (5, 2):  \nNew body: head (5, 2), then (4, 2), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0) \u2014 tail (1, 0) disappears.  \nFrom (5, 2): UP (5, 3) possibly empty (enemy could go RIGHT to (5, 3) this turn, making it occupied), DOWN (5, 1) empty, LEFT (4, 2) my body, RIGHT (6, 2) empty. So DOWN and RIGHT likely safe next turn.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Strategic choice**  \nUP puts me close to enemy, risk next turn.  \nLEFT leaves only one safe move next turn (LEFT again to (2, 2)), risky.  \nRIGHT gives two likely safe moves next turn (DOWN to (5, 1) or RIGHT to (6, 2)), and moves away from enemy.  \n\nBest is RIGHT: maximizes future options, avoids enemy proximity.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (5, 2), assess enemy position. Likely safe moves will be DOWN to (5, 1) or RIGHT to (6, 2). Aim to gradually move toward apples (8, 1) or (8, 8) while keeping distance from enemy.  \n\nRIGHT",

Once collected, my body will lengthen to 9 segments. I will then turn and head UP the 0-column to collect the apple at (0, 8).

I will continue moving RIGHT or start moving UP once I have cleared my own tail segments. I need to keep an eye on Snake #1's pathing, as it might contest the apples at (3, 5) or (8, 8).

Moving to (1, 2) would leave me with only one exit (RIGHT to 2, 2) before my tail at (3, 3) clears.\n- Snake #1 is at (6, 1). Moving RIGHT to (2, 1) keeps a healthy distance from them while moving away from my own coiled tail.\n- The closest apple is (3, 5). To get there, I need to move into the open space and eventually cross the row 3 line once my tail clears (which will take about 6 turns to fully clear the current row 3 segments).\n- Moving RIGHT to (2, 1) provides the most flexibility and avoids getting \"squeezed\" between my own body parts.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will move RIGHT to (2, 1). This moves me toward the center-right where there is more maneuvering room. I will wait for my tail to clear the row 3 barrier (currently at x=0, 1, 2, 3) before I attempt to head north for the apples at (3, 5) and (0, 8). I must keep an eye on Snake #1 to ensure they don't block my path to the right.\n\nRIGHT",

When I move, tail follows: new head at (5,1), rest shift: (6,1) becomes new segment 2, (6,0) segment 3, etc., tail (7,2) becomes new last segment? Let's trace:  \nCurrent: H(6,1), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (7,2), T(6,2)  \nMove LEFT to (5,1):  \nNew head (5,1), then old head (6,1) becomes segment 2, (6,0) segment 3, (7,0) segment 4, (8,0) segment 5, (8,1) segment 6, (8,2) segment 7, (7,2) segment 8, tail (6,2) is dropped.  \nSo after move, body: [(5,1), (6,1), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (7,2)]  \nTail at (7,2).  \nThus from (5,1) next turn:  \nUP (5,2) \u2013 empty (since tail moved from (6,2) to (7,2)).  \nDOWN (5,0) \u2013 empty.  \nLEFT (4,1) \u2013 empty.  \nRIGHT (6,1) \u2013 my body (segment 2) \u2192 illegal.  \nSo safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).  \n\nIf RIGHT to (7,1):  \nNew body: [(7,1), (6,1), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (7,2)]  \nTail at (7,2).  \nFrom (7,1) next turn:  \nUP (7,2) \u2013 my body (tail) \u2192 illegal.  \nDOWN (7,0) \u2013 my body (segment 4) \u2192 illegal.  \nLEFT (6,1) \u2013 my body (segment 2) \u2192 illegal.  \nRIGHT (8,1) \u2013 my body (segment 5) \u2192 illegal.  \nAll blocked! So RIGHT leads to certain death next turn unless I eat an apple this turn (which I won\u2019t, since no apple at (7,1)).  \nSo RIGHT is unsafe in practice because it traps me.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Strategic plan**  \nLEFT is clearly better: moves toward closest apple, avoids trap, gives 3 safe moves next turn.  \nEnemy is at (1,1) and can go UP or RIGHT. It might be heading toward (3,5) via (2,1)-(3,1)-(4,1)-(4,2) etc. I should move left quickly to get to (3,5) before enemy.  \nFrom (5,1) next turn, I can go UP to (5,2) then left toward apple, or DOWN to (5,0) then left, depending on enemy position.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5,1), check enemy head position. If enemy is moving toward apple, maybe take a more direct route (UP then LEFT). If not, continue left toward (4,1) etc. Avoid getting too close to enemy head to prevent head-on risk.\n\nLEFT",

Safe. My tail was at (1, 3) and is moving to (0, 3). However, the segment currently at (1, 3) will be the new tail. Wait\u2014looking at the body: the tail is (1, 3). After this move, (1, 3) will disappear. So (2, 3) is currently occupied by a body part, but it is *not* the tail. The tail is (1, 3). Let's re-examine body: (2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3). The tail is (1, 3). (2, 3) is empty. UP is safe.\n2. **DOWN:** Moves to (2, 1). **Invalid.** This is my neck.\n3. **LEFT:** Moves to (1, 2). Safe. The cell (1, 2) is empty.\n4. **RIGHT:** Moves to (3, 2). Safe. This moves me toward the center and the apple at (3, 5).\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Snake #1 is at (5, 2). If I move RIGHT to (3, 2) and they move LEFT to (4, 2), we will be adjacent.\n- The apple at (3, 5) is the closest. \n- My body currently forms a \"C\" shape or a coil on the left. I need to exit this area to reach the apples. Moving UP to (2, 3) or RIGHT to (3, 2) are the best ways to bypass my own segments at (0,3) and (1,3).\n- Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) puts me on a more direct path to (3, 5).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (3, 2). This positions me to head North towards the apple at (3, 5) and (3, 9). I must be careful of Snake #1, but moving to x=3 keeps a two-tile buffer from their current x=5 (assuming they might move to x=4).\n\nRIGHT",

This is safe. It moves me directly toward the apple at (3, 5). Note: Snake #1 is at (5, 4). If they move LEFT to (4, 4), they will be adjacent to me.\n2. **DOWN:** Moves to (3, 2). **Invalid.** This is my neck/body.\n3. **LEFT:** Moves to (2, 3). Safe.\n4. **RIGHT:** Moves to (4, 3). Safe, but puts me directly adjacent to Snake #1's previous head position and potentially closer to their head if they move LEFT or DOWN.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- The most immediate objective is the apple at (3, 5). \n- Snake #1 is at (5, 4). If I move UP to (3, 4) and they move LEFT to (4, 4), we are safe this turn, but they might contest (3, 5) on the next turn. However, I am currently closer (2 steps) to (3, 5) than they are (3 steps).\n- The board has plenty of open space above and to the right. My tail is clearing out from the bottom left.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to take the apple at (3, 5). Monitor Snake #1's movement; if they move toward (3, 5), prioritize securing it or pivoting to (0, 8) if contested. Once (3, 5) is secured, the next logical targets are (3, 9) and (0, 8).\n\nUP",

The closest apple for them is likely (8, 4) or (8, 8).\n- The apple at (3, 9) is directly above me. Moving UP puts me on a direct path to it.\n- Apple (0, 8) is also accessible, but moving UP first keeps my options open for both (3, 9) and (0, 8) while maintaining distance from Snake 1.\n- My tail is at (0, 1). As I move up, I am clearing the bottom-left area.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove toward (3, 9) to secure the lead. After reaching (3, 9), pivot toward (0, 8). Monitor Snake 1's progress toward the right side of the board; if they commit to (8, 8) or (9, 9), I have clear control over the top-left quadrant.\n\nUP",

If we both move toward each other, a head-on collision could occur at (5, 7) in two turns.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- I am currently leading 9 to 7.\n- Apple (3, 9) is directly in front of me.\n- Neighboring apple (0, 8) is also accessible.\n- Snake 1 is likely moving toward (8, 8), (9, 9), or (8, 4).\n- By moving UP, I maintain my path toward (3, 9) while keeping distance from Snake 1.\n\n**Strategy Note:**\nContinue moving UP to take the apple at (3, 9). After collecting it, the next immediate target should be the apple at (0, 8) to secure a wider lead and control the upper-left quadrant. Avoid moving into the middle-right area where Snake 1 is currently dominant unless necessary.\n\nUP",

It allows me to loop around the top left corner.\n- However, (6, 9) is quite close. Let's look at Snake 1. It is at (7, 8). It can reach (6, 9) in 2 turns (e.g., UP to 7,9 then LEFT to 6,9).

Eating it would grow me to length 9 (still shorter than enemy length 11 after they grow if they eat an apple, but they have no apple in reach this turn).  \nOther apples: (6,9) is close but requires UP then LEFT next turn; (9,9) is near (8,8).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Future safety after each move**  \nIf RIGHT to (8,8) \u2013 eat apple, new head at (8,8), new tail stays (5,3).

Eating (8,8) grows me and keeps 3 options next turn.  \nAfter eating (8,8), consider moving toward (9,9) or (6,9) depending on enemy movement.  \nEnemy is on left side, so staying in top-right is safer.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,8), if (9,9) still there, consider UP then RIGHT or RIGHT then UP to get it while avoiding being trapped.

Wait: eating apple means I grow, so next turn my body will be: head (8,4), then (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (6,7) \u2014 length 10.  \n\nFrom (8,4) after eating:  \nUP \u2192 (8,5): my new body segment (from growth) will be there? No, growth happens after move, so next turn (8,5) will be my neck, so moving back up into own neck is illegal. So UP not safe next turn.  \nDOWN \u2192 (8,3): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (7,4): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9,4): empty.  \nSo next turn from (8,4) would have 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\nIf UP to (8,6):  \nNext turn from (8,6): UP (8,7) my body, DOWN (8,5) empty, LEFT (7,6) empty, RIGHT (9,6) my body \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\nIf LEFT to (7,5):  \nNext turn from (7,5): UP (7,6) empty, DOWN (7,4) empty, LEFT (6,5) empty, RIGHT (8,5) empty \u2192 4 safe moves, but no apple this turn.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Risk of trapping after eating**  \nEating (8,4) puts me at bottom edge of board with enemy possibly moving toward center. But I\u2019ll have 3 safe moves next turn, not trapped.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nEnemy has 11 apples, I have 8. Need to catch up. Eating (8,4) now is efficient. After eating, I can go LEFT toward (5,4) or DOWN toward (9,2) later. Avoid moving toward enemy until I\u2019m longer.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating (8,4), choose among DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT based on enemy position. Likely go LEFT toward (5,4) apple if safe, else DOWN to open space.  \n\nDOWN",

Actually (6,9) is far from both.  \nClosest apple is (7,1) at distance 2 from both possible next heads.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Future safety after each move**  \nIf DOWN to (6,2):  \nNext turn from (6,2): UP (6,3) my neck, DOWN (6,1) empty, LEFT (5,2) empty, RIGHT (7,2) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (7,3):  \nNext turn from (7,3): UP (7,4) my body, DOWN (7,2) empty, LEFT (6,3) my neck, RIGHT (8,3) empty \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\nDOWN gives more options next turn.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nEnemy is on left side, I\u2019m on right. I need to collect apples while staying safe. (7,1) is the closest apple. From (6,2) I can go DOWN to (6,1) then LEFT to (5,1) then DOWN to (5,0) then RIGHT to (6,0) then UP to (6,1)?? Wait, better to think: from (6,2), DOWN to (6,1) then LEFT to (5,1) then DOWN to (5,0) then RIGHT to (6,0) then UP to (6,1) is a loop? Actually I should aim to go to (7,1) directly: from (6,2), RIGHT to (7,2) then DOWN to (7,1) eats apple. That path seems safe if (7,2) is empty next turn.  \n\nRIGHT now puts me at (7,3), then DOWN to (7,2) then DOWN to (7,1) also eats apple in two turns. But RIGHT now reduces next-turn options to 2, which is riskier if enemy approaches.  \n\nDOWN now keeps more options and still progresses toward (7,1).  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN is safer for future flexibility and moves toward closest apple.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,2), consider moving RIGHT to (7,2) to approach (7,1), or DOWN to (6,1) to keep options open.

Actually tail moves forward after growth, so (6,2) disappears, (9,6) stays? Wait: after eating, tail stays put one extra turn? In Snake, after eating, you grow at next move, so tail doesn\u2019t move that turn. So next turn, body will be: head at (7,1), then old head (7,2) becomes new neck, then (6,2), (6,3), \u2026, (9,6) plus new tail segment added after (9,6)? Actually growth adds segment at tail end after moving, so tail stays at (9,6) one more turn. Let\u2019s check: current length 10, after eating apple \u2192 length 11, so next turn tail stays at (9,6). So from (7,1): UP (7,2) will be my neck (occupied), DOWN (7,0) empty, LEFT (6,1) empty, RIGHT (8,1) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nIf UP to (7, 3):  \nNext turn from (7, 3): UP (7,4) my body, DOWN (7,2) empty (old head), LEFT (6,3) my body, RIGHT (8,3) empty \u2192 only 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\nIf RIGHT to (8, 2):  \nNext turn from (8, 2): UP (8,3) empty, DOWN (8,1) empty, LEFT (7,2) empty, RIGHT (9,2) apple \u2192 all 4 safe.  \n\nSo RIGHT gives best future mobility.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Path to closest apple**  \n(7,1) is closest, but eating it now reduces future options (only 3 safe moves next turn).  \n(9,2) is reachable in 2 moves via RIGHT twice.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Consider enemy movement**  \nEnemy could move UP toward center, but still far. My right side is open.  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN eats apple but reduces mobility. RIGHT keeps mobility high and positions for (9,2) next turn while staying safe. UP is less flexible.  \nGiven I\u2019m behind in apples (10 vs 11), I need to collect apples but also stay alive long-term. RIGHT now \u2192 next turn go RIGHT to (9,2) apple, then reassess.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 2), go RIGHT to (9, 2) to eat apple, unless enemy blocks.

Safe. It allows access to the center and the apple at (5, 5).\n2. **DOWN:** Moves to (4, 0). Safe. Moves me to the bottom edge, but limits my pathing toward current apples.\n3. **LEFT:** Moves to (3, 1). **Death** (moving into neck).\n4. **RIGHT:** Moves to (5, 1). Safe. This puts me on a direct path to the apple at (7, 1). However, Snake 1 is at (8, 2). If Snake 1 moves DOWN to (8, 1) or LEFT to (7, 2), they are extremely close. If I move to (5, 1) and Snake 1 moves to (7, 1) next turn, they get the apple and I'm forced to react.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Snake 1 is much closer to (7, 1) and (9, 2). They can reach (7, 1) in 2 moves (down then left, or left then down). \n- My best bet for an apple without a high-risk confrontation is (5, 5), but that is currently boxed in by Snake 1's body.\n- If I move RIGHT to (5, 1), I am putting myself in a narrow corridor between the bottom wall and Snake 1's body. \n- Snake 1's tail at (9, 5) is moving away, but their head is currently postured to take the bottom-right apples.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 1) allows me to potentially contest (7, 1) or slip under Snake 1 if they move UP. \n\n**Plan:**\nI will move RIGHT to (5, 1). This keeps the pressure on the apples at (7, 1) and (9, 2). I must be careful not to get trapped against the bottom edge if Snake 1 moves aggressively downward.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe. This is a very good move. It avoids the narrow bottom row, keeps distance from Snake 1's head at (8, 1), and positions me to potentially go for the apple at (5, 5).\n2. **DOWN:** Moves to (5, 0). Safe, but pins me against the bottom wall.\n3. **LEFT:** Moves to (4, 1). **Death** (backwards into neck).\n4. **RIGHT:** Moves to (6, 1). Safe, but very risky. The apple is at (7, 1). Snake 1 is at (8, 1). If we both move toward (7, 1), we will have a head-on collision at (7, 1) this turn. Even if Snake 1 doesn't move LEFT, I would be adjacent to their head in a very tight space.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nSnake 1 is at (8, 1) and I am at (5, 1). The apple is at (7, 1).\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 1) and Snake 1 moves LEFT to (7, 1), they get the apple.\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 1) and Snake 1 moves LEFT to (7, 1) next turn, we might collide.\nHowever, if I move UP to (5, 2), I am safe regardless of Snake 1's move. Snake 1 is currently blocking the path to (5, 5) with their body at (5, 3/4), but that body will move forward. More importantly, (5, 2) gives me the most flexibility to navigate the board.\n\n**Plan:**\nMoving RIGHT into (6, 1) is too dangerous given Snake 1's proximity and the likelihood of a head-on collision or getting trapped. Moving UP to (5, 2) is the safest constructive move, allowing me to observe Snake 1's pathing before committing to the bottom-right or center-board.\n\nUP",

The cell (3, 4) is currently empty. This move continues my path toward the center/upper apples and away from the dense body segments below.\n- **DOWN (3, 2):** **Death.** This is my neck (backwards move).\n- **LEFT (2, 3):** Safe.

This is also a viable move toward the apples, but (5, 3) is occupied by the enemy snake's body.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Snake 1 is at (5, 0). It is heavily restricted by its own body and the bottom-right corner. It cannot reach me or the center apples (5, 5) quickly.\n- To the right and below me, there is significant congestion from my own body and Snake 1's body.\n- Moving **UP** is the most open path. It sets me up to approach (5, 5) safely. From (3, 4), I can move to (4, 4) or (3, 5) depending on where Snake 1 moves.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to reach (3, 4). From there, continue navigating toward the apple at (5, 5). This keeps me in the most open part of the board and ahead of the enemy's potential pathing toward the upper apples.\n\nUP",

Moving UP now to (5, 6) keeps me flexible and starts the approach toward (6, 8) and (6, 9) while staying clear of my own body trailing below me.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (5, 6). Next turns will target (6, 8), then (6, 9) and (9, 9). I will monitor Snake #1 to ensure they don't escape their current bottom-row confinement and challenge the top-right quadrant.\n\nUP",

However, Snake 1 at (1, 2) is closer to the bottom-left area, though currently far from (0, 7).\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nThe most efficient path to scoring remains the cluster in the top right. \n- (6, 8) is 2 steps away (Right then Up, or Up then Right).\n- (6, 9) is 3 steps away.\n- (0, 7) is 5 steps away.\n- (9, 9) is 6 steps away.\n\nMoving **RIGHT** to (6, 7) is excellent because it positions me to take (6, 8) next turn. It also keeps my head away from the potential path of my own tail as it clears out of the (5, 2)-(3, 1) area. Snake 1 is at (1, 2) and is currently occupied in the bottom left, posing no immediate threat to the (6, 8) apple.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (6, 7).

Wait, body: (1, 5) is old head, (1, 4) is my body segment that won\u2019t move until I move. Actually, if I go DOWN, my head goes to (1, 5) which is currently empty, but then my body shifts: (1, 6) becomes body segment, (1, 5) becomes head, (1, 4) stays body. So from (1, 5) next turn: DOWN to (1, 4) would be my body \u2192 illegal. So DOWN reduces future options slightly.\n\n**LEFT to (0, 6)**:  \nNext turn from (0, 6):  \n- UP (0, 7): apple!  \n- DOWN (0, 5): empty.  \n- LEFT off board \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT (1, 6): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves, one leads to apple.\n\n**RIGHT to (2, 6)**:  \nNext turn from (2, 6):  \n- UP (2, 7): empty.  \n- DOWN (2, 5): empty.  \n- LEFT (1, 6): empty.  \n- RIGHT (3, 6): empty.  \nAll 4 moves possible, but no apple adjacent.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apples and long-term planning**  \nApples: (9, 9), (9, 2), (0, 7), (4, 3), (8, 0)  \n\nClosest apple to me is (0, 7) \u2014 distance 1 from (0, 6) or (1, 7).  \nFrom (1, 7): LEFT next turn gets apple.  \nFrom (0, 6): UP next turn gets apple.  \nBoth are equally close.  \n\nBut enemy is far away at top right, likely heading for (9, 9) apple. I should secure (0, 7) quickly.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Avoid future trap**  \nMy tail is at (6, 0), body length 12. I have space.  \nIf I go UP to (1, 7), I can go LEFT next turn to eat (0, 7) and grow. That also keeps me near top left where enemy isn\u2019t.  \nIf I go LEFT to (0, 6), I can go UP next turn to eat (0, 7).  \n\nBoth are safe, but UP gives slightly more options after eating apple because from (0, 7) after eating, I could go DOWN, RIGHT, or UP (if not off board). Actually (0, 7) \u2192 UP (0, 8) empty, DOWN (0, 6) my body after move, so maybe not great. Let\u2019s think:  \n\nIf I go UP now to (1, 7), then LEFT to (0, 7) apple next turn:  \nMy body will be: head at (0, 7), then (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), \u2026 tail at (6, 0).  \nFrom (0, 7) after eating:  \n- UP (0, 8): empty.  \n- DOWN (0, 6): my body (segment that was at (1, 6) now at (0, 6)? Wait, need to simulate:  \nTurn 69: head at (1, 6), body: (1, 5), (1, 4), \u2026 (6, 0).  \nMove UP to (1, 7).  \nTurn 70: head at (1, 7), body: (1, 6), (1, 5), \u2026 (5, 0).  \nMove LEFT to (0, 7) apple.  \nTurn 71: head at (0, 7), body: (1, 7), (1, 6), \u2026 (4, 0), and new tail segment stays at (4, 0) because apple growth means tail doesn\u2019t move that turn.  \nSo at turn 71, (0, 6) is empty. So DOWN from (0, 7) is safe.  \n\nSo after eating apple at (0, 7), I\u2019ll have options DOWN, UP, RIGHT (1, 7) is body, so only DOWN and UP. That\u2019s a bit tight.  \n\nIf I go LEFT now to (0, 6), then UP to (0, 7) apple next turn:  \nTurn 69: head (1, 6) \u2192 LEFT to (0, 6).  \nTurn 70: head (0, 6), body: (1, 6), (1, 5), \u2026 (5, 0).  \nMove UP to (0, 7) apple.  \nTurn 71: head (0, 7), body: (0, 6), (1, 6), \u2026 (4, 0).  \nFrom (0, 7): UP (0, 8) empty, DOWN (0, 6) body, RIGHT (1, 7) empty. So two options UP or RIGHT.  \n\nBoth sequences give 2 options after apple.  \n\nBut going UP now keeps me farther from my long body in bottom row, reducing risk of boxing myself.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction**  \nEnemy at (7, 9) will likely go DOWN to (7, 8) or RIGHT to (8, 9) to approach (9, 9) apple. Either way, it\u2019s far from me.  \n\nI\u2019ll go UP now, then LEFT next turn to eat (0, 7). After that, I can go UP or DOWN from (0, 7) to maneuver toward (4, 3) or (9, 2) later.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 7), move LEFT to eat apple at (0, 7). Then assess safe exits.  \n\nUP",
