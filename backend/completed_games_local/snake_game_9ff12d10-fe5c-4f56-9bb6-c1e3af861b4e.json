So after eating apple, body: [(7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5)] \u2014 length 5.  \n   From (7,7) next turn:  \n   - UP (7,8) empty  \n   - DOWN (7,6) my body  \n   - LEFT (6,7) empty  \n   - RIGHT (8,7) empty  \n   So 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n2. **LEFT to (6,6)**  \n   No apple. Body: [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (6,5)], tail (5,5) gone.  \n   From (6,6) next turn:  \n   - UP (6,7) empty  \n   - DOWN (6,5) my body  \n   - LEFT (5,6) empty  \n   - RIGHT (7,6) my body  \n   So only 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT).  \n\n3. **RIGHT to (8,6)**  \n   No apple. Body: [(8,6), (7,6), (7,5), (6,5)], tail (5,5) gone.  \n   From (8,6) next turn:  \n   - UP (8,7) empty  \n   - DOWN (8,5) empty  \n   - LEFT (7,6) my body  \n   - RIGHT (9,6) apple  \n   So 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT), and next turn can eat apple at (9,6).  \n\n---\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is (7,7) \u2014 1 step away (UP). Eating it now gets me to 4 apples, tying enemy\u2019s apple count.  \nRIGHT to (8,6) sets up (9,6) apple next turn, but enemy could also be moving toward apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nTake the apple at (7,7) now to tie score and grow to length 5. After eating, move toward center to keep mobility. From (7,7) next turn, avoid DOWN into body, choose UP/LEFT/RIGHT depending on safety. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s possible path toward (4,8) or (2,8).  \n\n---\n\nUP",

This is the most direct path to the nearest apple at (1, 5).\n   - **DOWN**: (1, 2). **Deadly**. This is my own body segment (directly behind the head).\n   - **LEFT**: (0, 3). **Safe**. However, it moves away from the cluster of apples and closer to the wall.\n   - **RIGHT**: (2, 3). **Safe**. Provides more room in the center of the board, but moves away from the target apple at (1, 5).\n\n2. **Apple Analysis**:\n   - Primary target: (1, 5). Distance: 2 moves (1, 4) -> (1, 5).\n   - Secondary targets: (2, 8) and (2, 9).\n   - Snake #0 is currently at (6, 8). It is likely moving toward (4, 8) or perhaps (2, 8). I have a clear path to (1, 5) before there is any potential conflict with Snake #0.\n\n3. **Collision / Space Evaluation**:\n   - My body is clearing out of the (1, 1) and (2, 1) area. Moving UP to (1, 4) maintains my trajectory towards the northern apples while staying on the west side of the board.\n   - Snake #0 at (6, 8) is far enough away. I should remain mindful as I approach the top-left corner where several apples are clustered.\n\n4. **Strategic Choice**:\n   Move UP to (1, 4). This continues the progression toward (1, 5).\n\n**Long-term plan**:\nCollect the apple at (1, 5), then continue UP toward (2, 8) and (2, 9). Monitor Snake #0's movement; if it moves toward the (2, 8) area, be prepared to navigate carefully to avoid a head-on collision or being trapped against the top/left walls.\n\nUP",

It creates distance from Snake #0's head and prepares a path to the (0, 9) apple.\n\n**Long-term plan**:\nMove LEFT to (0, 7), then UP towards (0, 9).

Snake #0 might try to intercept the apple at (0, 9) or move right to grab its own space. Given my current body position (pinned against the left wall), moving UP to (0, 8) and then (0, 9) is the most logical path. If Snake #0 moves to (1, 9), I must be careful of a head-on collision at (0, 9) on the following turn, but currently, UP is safe.\n\n**Long-term plan**:\nMove UP to (0, 8) then to (0, 9) to collect the apple. Monitor Snake #0's head at (2, 9). If it moves towards me (to 1, 9), I may need to reconsider the (0, 9) apple to avoid a head-on collision. If it moves away, I will secure the apple and then look to head DOWN along the 0-column or move into the center.\n\nUP",

This is my own body.\n- **LEFT**: Off-board. **Deadly**.\n- **RIGHT**: (1, 8). Safe. This move avoids a potential head-on collision at (0, 9) and moves away from the corner.\n\n2. **Risk Analysis**:\nSnake #0 is currently at (1, 9). Its only legal moves are LEFT to (0, 9) or DOWN to (1, 8). \n- If I move UP to (0, 9) and Snake #0 moves LEFT to (0, 9), we both die.\n- If I move RIGHT to (1, 8) and Snake #0 moves DOWN to (1, 8), we both die.\n- If I move RIGHT to (1, 8) and Snake #0 moves LEFT to (0, 9), I am safe and have successfully escaped the pocket.\n\n3. **Strategic Choice**:\nMoving UP is extremely risky because the apple at (0, 9) is a natural target for both snakes, and a head-on collision is highly likely. Move RIGHT is also risky but necessary to avoid being pinned. However, looking at the board, if I move RIGHT and Snake #0 moves DOWN, we collide. If I move UP and he moves DOWN, I get the apple and he hits my body (at 1, 8) or moves into the empty space. \nWait, if I move UP to (0, 9), and Snake #0 moves DOWN to (1, 8), I get the apple safely. If Snake #0 moves LEFT to (0, 9), we draw/die.\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 8), and Snake #0 moves DOWN to (1, 8), we draw/die. \nBetween the two, UP gives me an apple if I survive. But there's a safer consideration: Snake #0's body is at (2, 8). If I move RIGHT to (1, 8), I am not hitting any body. \n\nActually, UP is the move. If I move UP and we collide, the game ends in a draw/score comparison. If I don't move UP, I'm potentially trapping myself in the corner against my own body. Given Snake #0 is ahead in apples (7 vs 5), I should avoid a collision unless I can take the apple. But if I don't move UP, Snake #0 takes (0, 9) and I am stuck. \n\nWait, the most common snake AI behavior is to go for the closest apple. Snake #0 will almost certainly move LEFT to (0, 9). If I move UP, we collide. If I move RIGHT, I might survive if he moves LEFT. \n\nLet's reconsider. RIGHT is safer for purely avoiding the (0, 9) collision.\n\nRIGHT",

This is the current body of Snake #0. However, wait\u2014let's re-examine the coordinates.\n\nSnake #0's body is at (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8).\nMy Head is at (1, 8).\n- UP (1, 9): Snake #0's body.\n- DOWN (1, 7): My body.\n- LEFT (0, 8): My body.\n- RIGHT (2, 8): Snake #0's body.\n\nRe-checking move RIGHT: (2, 8) is Snake #0's body. If Snake #0 moves, its tail at (7, 8) will move, but (2, 8) will not clear this turn.\nWait, let's look at the \"Board state\" representation provided:\n9 0 T T . . . . . . .\n8 T 1 T T T T T T . .\nRow 8 shows: (0, 8) is Tail/Body, (1, 8) is Me, (2, 8) through (7, 8) are Snake #0's body.\nRow 9 shows: (0, 9) is Snake #0 Head, (1, 9) and (2, 9) are its body.\n\nWait, if I am at (1, 8), and my body is [(0, 8), (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5)]:\nMoving RIGHT leads to (2, 8). (2, 8) is part of Snake #0's body.\nMoving UP leads to (1, 9). (1, 9) is part of Snake #0's body.\nMoving LEFT leads to (0, 8). (0, 8) is my tail. If I move, the tail at (1, 5) moves, but (0, 8) is the segment immediately behind my head. \nWait, the body is listed head-to-tail: (1, 8) -> (0, 8) -> (0, 7) -> (1, 7) -> (1, 6) -> (1, 5).\nThe tail is (1, 5). The segment (0, 8) will NOT move out of the way.\n\nIs there any escape?\nCheck (2, 7) - it's an apple! But I am at (1, 8).\nThe board state visual:\n8: T(0,8) 1(1,8) T(2,8) T(3,8) T(4,8) T(5,8) T(6,8) T(7,8)\nSnake #0 has effectively pinned me against its own long body.\nHowever, I must choose a move. (2, 8) is Snake #0's body. (1, 9) is Snake #0's body. (0, 8) is my body. (1, 7) is my body.\nWait, (2, 7) is an apple and is empty. If I could get to (2, 7). To get to (2, 7) from (1, 8), I would need to go DOWN or RIGHT.\nDOWN is (1, 7) - my body.\nRIGHT is (2, 8) - enemy body.\nThere is no \"safe\" move. However, if Snake #0's head was at (0, 9) and it moves to (0, 8) or (1, 9), it might vacate a spot? No, it's moving *forward*.\nThe only chance is if a body part vactates. Snake #0's body at (2, 8) is the 3rd segment. It won't vacate.\nMy own body at (1, 7) is the 4th segment. It won't vacate.\nMy only hope is that the coordinates provided in the \"Board state\" or \"Body\" lists have a typo and a direction is open. Based on the coordinate list: (1, 8) is surrounded by (0, 8), (1, 9), (2, 8), and (1, 7). \n\nI will move RIGHT and hope for the best.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, check: enemy body list is [(0,8), (0,7), \u2026], so (0,8) is enemy body segment \u2192 collision if I go there \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT (-1,9) \u2192 off board \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT (1,9) \u2192 my own body (second segment) \u2192 death.  \n\nAll four moves appear deadly. But last turn\u2019s rationale said after eating apple at (0,9), only safe move next turn would be DOWN to (0,8) because enemy would move to (1,8) and leave (0,8) empty. Let\u2019s verify current enemy position:  \nEnemy head is now at (1,8) (they moved RIGHT as predicted). Their body: [(0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5)]. So (0,8) is indeed occupied by enemy body.  \n\nThat means DOWN is not safe \u2014 it\u2019s into enemy body.  \n\nWait, did I miscalculate? Let\u2019s check board coordinates:  \nMy head (0,9). Enemy body includes (0,8). Yes, DOWN to (0,8) hits enemy body.  \n\nSo all four moves are fatal? That can\u2019t be right \u2014 maybe I misread my own body. My body after last move:  \nI moved LEFT from (1,9) to (0,9) and ate apple, so new head (0,9), old head (1,9) becomes second segment, rest as before. So my body: [(1,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), \u2026].  \nSo RIGHT to (1,9) is my own body \u2014 death.  \n\nSo indeed: UP off, DOWN enemy body, LEFT off, RIGHT own body \u2192 all deadly.  \n\nBut that means I must have made a fatal move last turn? No \u2014 last turn\u2019s rationale assumed enemy would be at (1,8) now, leaving (0,8) empty. But enemy\u2019s body includes (0,8) from before \u2014 they didn\u2019t vacate it because their tail didn\u2019t move? Let\u2019s trace:  \nEnemy previous turn: head (0,8), body [(0,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4)].  \nThey moved RIGHT to (1,8). New head (1,8), old head (0,8) becomes body segment, old tail (1,4) disappears (since no apple eaten). So new body: [(0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5)]. Yes, (0,8) is still there as first body segment.  \n\nSo DOWN is indeed into enemy body.  \n\nBut wait \u2014 if all moves are fatal, I\u2019m dead no matter what. That suggests I\u2019ve already lost? But the game is still asking for a move, so maybe I\u2019m missing something.  \n\nLet\u2019s re-check coordinates carefully:  \nBoard is 0\u20139 in x and y. My head (0,9).  \nUP (0,10) invalid.  \nDOWN (0,8) \u2014 enemy body at (0,8) yes.  \nLEFT (-1,9) invalid.  \nRIGHT (1,9) \u2014 my body at (1,9) yes.  \n\nSo indeed no safe move.  \n\nBut maybe the rules say: if you have no safe move, you must still pick one and die. But the instruction says \u201cnever choose a move that obviously kills you\u201d \u2014 but here all kill me.  \n\nPerhaps I\u2019m misreading enemy body \u2014 maybe (0,8) is not actually there? Let\u2019s look at the board state given:  \nRow 8: \"T 1 T T T T T T . .\"  \nCoordinates: y=8, x=0..9:  \nx=0: T (my tail? No, my tail is at (2,8) per my body list) \u2014 actually T is my body segment? Wait T is my snake (ID 0). At (0,8) on board: T. That means (0,8) is my body, not enemy\u2019s.  \n\nYes! Look:  \nRow 8: \"T 1 T T T T T T . .\"  \nx=0, y=8: T (my snake)  \nx=1, y=8: 1 (enemy head)  \nx=2, y=8: T (my body)  \n\nSo (0,8) is my body segment \u2014 not enemy\u2019s.  \n\nSo enemy body list in text must be wrong? Let\u2019s check: Enemy body given: [(0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5)] \u2014 but board shows (0,8) as T (me), not enemy. So likely a typo in the enemy body list \u2014 maybe it should be [(1,8)? No, that\u2019s head]. Actually enemy head is (1,8), body segments: (0,8) can\u2019t be enemy if board says T.  \n\nSo I trust the board visual: (0,8) is my body.  \n\nThen DOWN to (0,8) is into my own body \u2014 still death.  \n\nSo still all moves fatal?  \n\nWait \u2014 my body list: [(1,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), \u2026] \u2014 (0,8) is not in my body list. So why is (0,8) marked T? That\u2019s a contradiction.  \n\nLet\u2019s check my body coordinates again:  \nFrom last turn: my body before move: [(1,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8)]  \nI moved LEFT to (0,9) and ate apple, so new head (0,9), old head (1,9) becomes segment 2, rest shift. Tail stays at (2,8) until I move next turn (growth happens after move). So after move but before growth: body = [(1,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8)] \u2014 length 8 segments.  \n\nSo (0,8) is not in my body.  \n\nBut board says (0,8) is T. That means either board is wrong or I\u2019m misreading coordinates. Let\u2019s check row y=8:  \n\"T 1 T T T T T T . .\"  \nx=0: T  \nx=1: 1  \nx=2: T  \nx=3: T  \nx=4: T  \nx=5: T  \nx=6: T  \nx=7: T  \nx=8: .  \nx=9: .  \n\nMy body segments at y=8: (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8) \u2014 those match T at x=2..7.  \n(0,8) as T \u2014 that\u2019s not my body. Could be a display error? Or maybe my body includes (0,8) from earlier? No.  \n\nGiven this confusion, I\u2019ll trust my body list from game data: my body doesn\u2019t include (0,8). So DOWN to (0,8) is empty.  \n\nThen safe moves: DOWN only.  \n\n---\n\n**So only DOWN is safe.**  \n\n**Next turn plan:**  \nFrom (0,8) next turn, I\u2019ll have length 9 (growth from apple). Tail will be at (2,8) still.  \nEnemy head at (1,8) now, will move somewhere. Need to avoid head-on.  \n\nBut for now, only DOWN works.  \n\nDOWN",
