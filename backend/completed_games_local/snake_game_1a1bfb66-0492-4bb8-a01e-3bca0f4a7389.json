Wait \u2014 (5, 7) is currently empty but will be my body next turn if I move UP now? Actually, if I move UP now, my current head becomes body segment (5, 7) and tail stays (4, 6). So if I move LEFT now to (4, 7), next turn my body will be [(4, 7), (5, 7), (4, 6)]. So RIGHT from (4, 7) next turn goes to (5, 7) which is body \u2192 invalid. So safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n- **RIGHT** (6, 7): Next turn: UP (6, 8), DOWN (6, 6) enemy body \u2192 invalid, LEFT (5, 7) body, RIGHT (7, 7) \u2192 only 2 safe moves.\n\nSo UP and LEFT give better mobility than RIGHT.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is longer (4 apples vs my 2), so avoid confrontation.  \nGoing UP keeps me near top edge but open space.  \nGoing LEFT moves toward apples (2, 3) and (1, 3) but also toward center.  \nRIGHT reduces mobility next turn.\n\n**Final move:** UP keeps options open and avoids immediate dead ends.\n\nUP",

Wait, careful: After eating, my body will extend by one \u2014 so new body appended at tail before head moves? Actually: head moves to apple cell, old body shifts, tail stays put (since we eat apple). So new body: [(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5)].  \nNext moves from (2,3): UP (back to 2,4) gets blocked by new body segment? Let's check:  \nAfter move DOWN: segments: head (2,3), then (2,4) (was old head), (3,4), (3,5).  \nSo from (2,3), UP: (2,4) is my body \u2192 unsafe immediately next turn? Wait, no enemy collision scenario? Let's check carefully:\n\nActually, I misunderstood \u2014 eating apple means at the end of turn, we add a new segment at the tail (so tail doesn't move that turn). So after moving head to apple, the segments shift: each body segment moves forward along the path, and the tail does NOT move but we add a new segment at tail, so tail stays in same place as before but becomes part of lengthened snake.\n\nLet\u2019s track:\nBefore move: head (2,4), body [(3,4), (3,5)].  \nMove DOWN: head to (2,3) (apple).  \nBody shifts: segment1 (old head 2,4) becomes new segment1.  \nSegment2 (3,4) becomes new segment2.  \nTail was (3,5) \u2014 it does not move, but a new segment is added there (since we ate apple), so tail remains at (3,5).  \nThus new body: [(2,4), (3,4), (3,5)].  \nSo from new head (2,3), possible moves next turn:  \n- UP: (2,4) \u2192 my body \u2192 unsafe  \n- DOWN: (2,2) \u2192 free  \n- LEFT: (1,3) \u2192 free  \n- RIGHT: (3,3) \u2192 free  \n\nSo after eating apple at (2,3), I will have UP blocked but DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT open \u2014 decent mobility.\n\n- UP to (2,5): free, but no apple there. Next moves possible: UP (2,6), LEFT (1,5), RIGHT (3,5) but (3,5) is my body after move? Wait, after moving UP to (2,5), body becomes [(2,4), (3,4), (3,5)]. So from (2,5): UP (2,6) free, DOWN (2,4) body \u2192 no, LEFT (1,5) free, RIGHT (3,5) body \u2192 no. So actually only UP and LEFT possible next turn \u2014 this is risky; low mobility (only 2 moves).\n\n- LEFT to (1,4): free, next moves: UP (1,5), DOWN (1,3) near apple, LEFT (0,4) free, RIGHT (2,4) body? Wait body after moving LEFT to (1,4): body segments: [(2,4), (3,4), (3,5)]. So from (1,4): UP (1,5) free, DOWN (1,3) free, LEFT (0,4) free, RIGHT (2,4) body \u2192 blocked. So 3 moves possible \u2014 good mobility.\n\n**Decision:**  \nDOWN gives immediate apple, growth, good mobility after eating (3 directions except UP).  \nLEFT gives no immediate apple but keeps me mobile and closer to apple (1,3) for next turn.  \nUP is safe but worse mobility (only 2 moves next turn).\n\nBest is DOWN: eat apple now, grow, stay safe.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating apple at (2,3), likely go LEFT to (1,3) to eat second apple if still available, else DOWN/LEFT to open area.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (2, 3) with body segments at (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5).\n\nLet me evaluate the four possible moves:\n\n1. UP: From (6, 3) to (6, 4)\n   - Safe move (on board, no bodies)\n   - Moves to (6, 4), which is currently empty\n   - Doesn't move directly toward any apple\n\n2.

RIGHT: From (6, 3) to (7, 3)\n   - NOT safe - moves into my own body segment at (7, 3)\n   - Would kill me\n\nI have only one safe move: LEFT.\n\nStrategically:\n- LEFT would take me to (5, 3), positioning me closer to the apples at (1, 3) and (2, 7)\n- The apples at (1, 3) and (2, 7) are in the left direction from my current position\n- The apple at (9, 2) is to my right, but I can't move right this turn as it would hit my own body\n- The apple at (7, 0) is below me, but I can't move down as it would hit my own body\n\nI should also consider the enemy snake's position. The enemy snake is at (2, 3) with body at (2, 4) and (3, 4). Moving LEFT would take me away from the enemy snake, which is good for safety.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think LEFT is the best move as it:\n1. Is the only safe move\n2. Moves me toward the apples at (1, 3) and (2, 7)\n3. Takes me away from the enemy snake\n4. Keeps future options open\n\nI'll choose LEFT to move to (5, 3).\n\nLEFT",

Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP: (6, 4) free  \n- DOWN: (6, 2) its body \u2192 unsafe for it  \n- LEFT: (5, 3) free  \n- RIGHT: (7, 3) its body \u2192 unsafe  \n\nEnemy will likely go UP or LEFT. Distance to me: |6-2| + |3-3| = 4. Enemy too far to hit me this turn. No head-on risk.  \n\n**Mobility after each safe move:**  \n- LEFT to (1, 3): eat apple \u2192 new body: head (1,3), body [(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5)].  \n  Next turn from (1,3): UP (1,4) free, DOWN (1,2) free, LEFT (0,3) free, RIGHT (2,3) my body \u2192 unsafe.

The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (1, 2) with body segments at (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4).\n\nLet me evaluate the four possible moves:\n\n1. UP: From (4, 3) to (4, 4)\n   - Safe move (on board, no bodies)\n   - Moves to (4, 4), which is currently empty\n   - Moves closer to apples at (2, 7), (1, 1), and (1, 8)\n\n2. DOWN: From (4, 3) to (4, 2)\n   - Safe move (on board, no bodies)\n   - Moves to (4, 2), which is currently empty\n   - Moves closer to apples at (9, 2) and (7, 0)\n\n3. LEFT: From (4, 3) to (3, 3)\n   - Safe move (on board, no bodies)\n   - Moves to (3, 3), which is currently empty\n   - Moves closer to apples at (2, 7), (1, 1), and (1, 8)\n\n4. RIGHT: From (4, 3) to (5, 3)\n   - NOT safe - moves into my own body segment at (5, 3)\n   - Would kill me\n\nI have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and LEFT.\n\nStrategically:\n- UP and LEFT both move me closer to the same set of apples (2, 7), (1, 1), and (1, 8)\n- DOWN moves me closer to different apples (9, 2) and (7, 0)\n- The enemy snake is at (1, 2) with body at (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)\n- Moving LEFT would take me away from the enemy snake, which is good for safety\n\nGiven these considerations, I think LEFT is the best move as it:\n1. Is safe\n2. Moves me closer to multiple apples (2, 7), (1, 1), and (1, 8)\n3. Takes me away from the enemy snake\n4. Keeps future options open\n\nI'll choose LEFT to move to (3, 3).\n\nLEFT",

Enemy snake #0 head at (4, 3) is 5 spaces away, not an immediate threat.\n\n**Safety check from (1, 2):**\n- UP (1, 3): My body \u2192 **DEATH**\n- DOWN (1, 1): Apple cell, safe (only collision risk is with enemy head, but enemy is far).\n- LEFT (0, 2): Free cell.\n- RIGHT (2, 2): Free cell.\n\n**Safe moves:** DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Apple targeting:**\n- DOWN goes directly to apple (1, 1). This is optimal for growth.\n- LEFT/RIGHT move away from the closest apple.\n\n**Future mobility after each move:**\n- After DOWN (1, 1): Can go LEFT (0,1), RIGHT (2,1), or UP (1,2) which is my neck. 2 safe options.\n- After LEFT (0, 2): On edge. Can go UP (0,3), DOWN (0,1), RIGHT (1,2) is neck. 2 safe options but constrained by left edge.\n- After RIGHT (2, 2): Can go UP (2,3) is body? Wait, my body is at (2,3) so unsafe. So UP is blocked. DOWN (2,1), LEFT (1,2) is neck, RIGHT (3,2). Actually only 2 safe options: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nDOWN gives immediate apple and similar future mobility to alternatives. Grabbing the apple now is best.\n\n**Enemy consideration:**\nEnemy is at (4,3). They might move towards center apples, but are distant. No head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Decision:**\nDOWN to collect the apple at (1,1) is the clear best move. It grows me, is safe, and maintains good options.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**\nAfter eating apple at (1,1), my body will be longer. From (1,1), check safety of LEFT (0,1) and RIGHT (2,1). Prefer moving away from the left edge to avoid getting trapped. Possibly head towards apple at (7,0) or (2,7) next, but prioritize safety and space.\n\nDOWN",
