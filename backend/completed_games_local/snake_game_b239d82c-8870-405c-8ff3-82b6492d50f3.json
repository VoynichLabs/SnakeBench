Safe and beneficial\n\n**Enemy Snake #0:**\n- Head: (0, 3)\n- Body: [(0, 2), (0, 1), (1, 1)]\n- Apples: 3\n\n**Enemy's possible moves from (0, 3):**\n- UP: (0, 4) - Safe\n- DOWN: (0, 2) - This is its body, would kill it\n- LEFT: (-1, 3) - Off board, would kill it\n- RIGHT: (1, 3) - Safe\n\nSo the enemy has two safe moves: UP to (0,4) or RIGHT to (1,3).\n\n**Remaining Apples:**\n- (1, 5), (4, 6), (4, 0), (5, 1)\n\nWait, let me recheck the board state. I see an apple at (7,5) in the board display, but it's not listed in the apple coordinates.

That makes this a very attractive move.\n\n**Safe moves analysis:**\n- RIGHT to (7,5): This is an apple! Very good move - I gain a point and grow\n- DOWN to (6,4): Safe but less beneficial\n- LEFT to (5,5): Safe but less beneficial\n\n**Conclusion:**\nRIGHT is clearly the best move - it's safe and gives me an apple. This will bring me to 3 apples total, putting me closer to the enemy's 3 apples.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**\nAfter eating the apple at (7,5), my head will be at (7,5) and my body will be [(6,5), (6,6), (5,6)]. I should plan my next move carefully to avoid blocking myself in.\n\nRIGHT",
