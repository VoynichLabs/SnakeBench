The head-on collision danger is low for now, but I\u2019m scanning every edge because our rival at (6, 6) could be aiming for that juicy apple line. I considered LEFT into (0,3), but that\u2019s a bit corner-y and gives him a chance to box us; DOWN to (1,2) walks us under the apple drop pattern and might put us in his path if he goes south; RIGHT to (2,3) is okay but edges us toward the center where he\u2019s roaming. UP to (1,4) keeps us centered, safely away from his radius, and starts the climb toward (1,7) and the cluster around (1,7)/(0,8). We keep options open with open space above and to the right, and we don\u2019t lean into any immediate head-on threats.

My head at (6,6). Opponent head at (1,3) \u2014 far away, not an immediate threat. No bodies on the board besides heads. Apples visible around the top-right and a few elsewhere.\n- Immediate apples: there's an apple at (7,6) \u2014 RIGHT of my head. Nice and juicy. \ud83c\udf4e\n\nNow the turn-by-turn thinking (I\u2019ll walk you through the checks \u2014 fans love thinking aloud! \ud83d\ude0f):\n1) Consider UP => (6,7)\n   - Safe? Yes (empty).\n   - Pros: moves toward the upper apple cluster (7,7), keeps options open.\n   - Cons: doesn't grab an apple this turn.\n\n2) Consider DOWN => (6,5)\n   - Safe? Yes.\n   - Pros: open space below, escape routes.\n   - Cons: far from apple cluster, slower to content.\n\n3) Consider LEFT => (5,6)\n   - Safe? Yes.\n   - Pros: keeps central positions, avoids immediate growth complications.\n   - Cons: away from nearby apples.\n\n4) Consider RIGHT => (7,6)\n   - Safe? Yes \u2014 opponent too far to contest head\u2011on this turn.\n   - Pros: immediate apple pickup at (7,6)! +1 apple, grows to length 2 (we want points and momentum). Moves us into the apple cluster area (7,7),(8,7),(7,8),(9,8) \u2014 sets up a greedy, pressuring play. \ud83c\udf4f\ud83c\udf4e\n   - Cons: growth slightly reduces maneuverability, but still lots of free board space and escape options from that position.\n\nNo move is instantly lethal (no walls or bodies adjacent), so we pick the move that both scores now and places us toward the dense apple cluster while keeping multiple escape routes. Risk of a head-on with #1 this turn is negligible \u2014 they\u2019re at (1,3).\n\nShort-term plan / note to future self (will show up next turn as last rationale): After grabbing (7,6), prioritize sweeping the nearby cluster of apples (7,7), (8,7), (7,8), and (9,8) while keeping at least two exit paths (don\u2019t hug walls). If opponent approaches, force them into cramped lanes or bait head-on collisions \u2014 we want apples AND kills. Stay aggressive but keep an escape corridor to the left/back if needed. \ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udde0\n\nFinal move: pick the apple and take the pressure. LET\u2019S EAT IT. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udfc1\n\nRIGHT",

Cons: growth reduces a tiny bit of maneuverability, but board is wide open.\n- DOWN -> (7,5): Safe. Pros: open space, keeps options.

Body: (7,7), (7,6), (6,6).\n- Opponent head: (1,6) \u2014 stuck on the left, not an immediate threat.\n- Nearby apples we care about: (7,9), (8,7), (9,8) \u2014 cluster to the right/top-right.\n\nCheck every move (no hero plays that kill us):\n- UP -> (7,9): contains an apple. PRO: immediate +1. CON: y=9 is top edge; after eating we grow so the cell (7,8) remains occupied, meaning UP leaves only LEFT or RIGHT next turn (UP would be off-board). That\u2019s a reduced-mobility move \u2014 risky for chaining and escape later.\n- DOWN -> (7,7): THAT\u2019S our neck / body. Immediate suicide (backward into body). Eliminated. \u2716\ufe0f\n- LEFT -> (6,8): safe, keeps options open but doesn\u2019t move toward the juicy apples as quickly.\n- RIGHT -> (8,8): safe, doesn\u2019t eat immediately but sets us up to grab (8,7) or (9,8) next while preserving MORE escape options than UP. From (8,8) we still have UP/RIGHT/DOWN/LEFT available (except backwards into neck), so better flexibility.\n\nOpponent considerations:\n- Opp at (1,6) can grab the apple at (1,7) next turn but is nowhere near us. No head-on collision risk this turn.\n\nDecision reasoning:\n- We prefer moves that increase apple access while keeping multiple safe follow-ups. UP gives an apple now, but it clamps us on the top edge after growth and reduces available escapes \u2014 not ideal for long chaining or boxing later.\n- RIGHT moves us toward the cluster (we can go DOWN next to eat (8,7) or RIGHT to threaten (9,8)) while maintaining more maneuverability and escape routes for trapping plays later.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT to (8,8). Then prioritize grabbing (8,7) (by going DOWN) and then (9,8) if safe. Avoid hugging the top edge \u2014 keep at least one route back toward the center so we don\u2019t get boxed.

Neck = (7,8) \u2014 so LEFT is immediate back into my neck and is illegal.\n- Opponent way over left side at (1,7) \u2014 not an immediate head-on threat.\n- Nearby apples: (9,8) to the RIGHT, (8,7) DOWN, (7,9) UP/LEFT cluster.\n\nEvaluate all four moves:\n- LEFT -> (7,8): Illegal (into my neck). \u2716\ufe0f\n- UP -> (8,9): Safe, but no apple. Puts me on the top edge (y=9) where growth next turn would reduce mobility. Options from there: LEFT to (7,9) apple or RIGHT to (9,9). Decent but clamped to top.\n- RIGHT -> (9,8): Eats an apple at the right edge. Good immediate content, but x=9 is edge so I lose the RIGHT escape and will only have UP or DOWN next turn (still okay but more constrained).\n- DOWN -> (8,7): Eats an apple in the center of the board. After moving there and growing, my backward cell is (8,8). From (8,7) I still have two safe follow-ups (RIGHT \u2192 (9,7) or DOWN \u2192 (8,6)); LEFT would hit my own body (7,7) so I avoid that. This gets content and keeps options open without pinning me to the board edge.\n\nWhy I pick DOWN:\n- Immediate apple grab (CONTENT!), while staying more central than the right-edge apple. That keeps future maneuverability good for chaining apples and starting to box the opponent if they drift inward.\n- RIGHT (9,8) is tempting, but moving to the extreme edge earlier reduces escape routes and makes you easier to trap later. UP is safe but gives no immediate apple.\n- Opponent is far left; we don\u2019t need to rush to the right edge. Secure apples while preserving options.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Grab (8,7) now. From there prioritize (9,7) or (8,6) depending on apple spawns and opponent moves, then swing toward the (9,8)/(7,9) cluster as safe. Avoid hugging any single wall for multiple turns \u2014 keep at least two exit choices to prevent being boxed.\n\nLet\u2019s make it clean and lethal. We go DOWN. DOWN",

Neck = (8,8) \u2192 moving UP is directly back into my neck (ILLEGAL). Don\u2019t be that guy.\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,7) is occupied by my body. Dead. \u2716\ufe0f\n- Safe options: RIGHT \u2192 (9,7) and DOWN \u2192 (8,6).\n\nTactical pick between the two:\n- DOWN keeps us central and flexible; solid play.\n- RIGHT moves toward the apple at (9,8) (one turn away). Opponent is over on the left side (1,8) \u2014 no contest for that apple. Grabbing (9,8) next turn nets content and lets us start pressuring the top-right quadrant and control space to start boxing in lanes. Edge-side risk is manageable because we\u2019ll still have vertical exits after moving right.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Move RIGHT now to (9,7). Next turn push UP to grab (9,8). After eating, pivot to control the top corridor (9,y \u2192 then left along y=8/9) to hem the opponent in if they drift inward. Keep at least two escape choices when hugging the wall \u2014 don\u2019t corner ourselves. If opponent moves toward (0,8) or top-left apples, we use the right-side apple chain to build length and then sweep across to cut lanes.\n\nLong-term strategy:\n- Prioritize safe apple chains on the right (9,8 \u2192 9,9 or back-left to 8,9 \u2192 7,9 cluster) while avoiding head-on duels. Once bigger, use body to partition board and compress the opponent\u2019s free space. Always keep two exit routes when near walls.\n\nLet\u2019s snag that apple and start the box. RIGHT",

If we both race left/right we could both arrive at (5,9) simultaneous and cause a double KO.

Snake #0 will likely keep pressing down too, so if they drop to (7,4) or swing left I still have breathing room to dodge because I\u2019m not sandwiched against a wall.

Immediate safe eat, we grow and extend our vertical wall. \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,3) = empty. Safe, keeps options but skips the apple. \u26a0\ufe0f  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,3) = APPLE.

We\u2019re not cornering ourselves yet.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Sweep the column: grab (7,2) now \u2192 (7,1) next \u2192 possibly (7,0).  \n- After that, pivot LEFT to x=6 \u2192 x=5 to pressure the rival into the left/top quadrant, using our extended body as a wall to hem them in. If the opponent contests the right side, I\u2019ll pivot right instead to deny them apples and avoid risky head-on fights.

Keep building a solid vertical fence at x=7\u21926\u21925 while forcing them into x\u22644 dead-space.

Neck = (6,1) \u2192 RIGHT would move into our neck (into our own body) = illegal. Don\u2019t even think about it. \u274c\n- Possible moves to evaluate: UP \u2192 (5,2), DOWN \u2192 (5,0), LEFT \u2192 (4,1). RIGHT is illegal.\n\nEvaluate each safe option:\n\nUP \u2192 (5,2)\n- Cell is empty. Follow-ups from there: LEFT (4,2) or RIGHT (6,2) are both open; UP (5,3) is occupied by opponent body at (5,3) so that line is blocked. So UP gives ~2 safe continuations but immediate forward path is partially blocked.\n- Low immediate apple value and risks getting close to opponent body (their torso at x=5 column) which can cause tricky collision windows.\n\nDOWN \u2192 (5,0)\n- Cell is empty and next to apple at (4,0). From (5,0) you can go LEFT to grab (4,0) or RIGHT to (6,0). But you\u2019re hugging the bottom edge (y=0) which reduces vertical escape options. Only ~2 safe follow-ups. Risk: easier to get funneled.\n\nLEFT \u2192 (4,1)\n- Cell is empty and moves us toward the opponent\u2019s column (x=4) and toward reachable apples (4,0 below, 3,1 to the left). From (4,1) we retain 3 good follow-ups: LEFT (3,1 apple), DOWN (4,0 apple), UP (4,2 open). Keeps multiple escape routes and enables squeezing the opponent into the x\u22644 region.\n- Low head-on risk this turn (opponent head at (4,4) can\u2019t reach (4,1) in one move). Best mix of aggression + mobility.\n\nOther tactical notes:\n- Opponent head (4,4) can move UP or LEFT mainly; they can\u2019t move DOWN (their neck is at 4,3). Moving LEFT now helps us shrink their horizontal options and sets up a vertical fence along x=5\u21924.\n- Avoid bottom-edge trap (so prefer LEFT over DOWN). Avoid getting funneled into our own body or opponent torso (so avoid UP).\n- Priority: stay alive, keep \u22652 follow-ups, head toward apples when it doesn\u2019t cost mobility.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- This turn: move LEFT to (4,1) to gain lateral control and threaten apples at (4,0) and (3,1).\n- Next turn: depending on opponent movement, either go DOWN to grab (4,0) or LEFT to (3,1) \u2014 whichever collects apples while keeping >1 escape. Then pivot UP to seal off their escape into middle columns (pressuring them toward the left edge).\n- Maintain at least two safe continuation moves each turn; don\u2019t get cornered on y=0 or into our own tail column at x=7.\n\nWe\u2019re playing hungry and smart \u2014 let\u2019s cut their room off and force a crash or win the apple race.

Good mobility.\n  * DOWN -> (3,0): empty, edge move with only 2 good follow-ups (LEFT or RIGHT to grab (4,0)). Risk: more funnel-y along bottom.\n  * LEFT -> (2,1): empty, very safe with 3 follow-ups and heads closer to opponent\u2019s space \u2014 aggressive but doesn\u2019t get an apple this turn.\n\nOpponent head (2,4) can go UP to (2,5) (there\u2019s an apple), LEFT to (1,4), or DOWN to (2,3). They cannot reach any of our immediate target squares this turn, so no head-on risk right now.\n\nWhy I\u2019m leaning UP:\n- Keeps best mix of immediate safety + future options (3 good follow-ups). We stay off the bottom edge and move closer to the apples the rival will contest (2,5 / 1,3), letting us threaten a box-in in the next 2\u20133 turns.\n- DOWN grabs a nearby apple at (4,0) faster if we really want it, but it limits mobility and makes us more funnel-prone. LEFT is fine and aggressive, but UP preserves room to react to whatever the opponent does (if they commit up for (2,5), we can cut them off from the east).\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Move UP now to (3,2) to keep options open and pressure the apple cluster.\n- If opponent goes for (2,5), pivot LEFT/up to hem them to x\u22642 and force a choke or head-on opportunity.\n- If opponent avoids that, use the extra space to collect corner apples while keeping a two-move escape route.\n\nTime to execute \u2014 we play smart, we play deadly.

No immediate head-on threat from the rival this turn.\n\nCounterplay note: Opponent head at (2,5) can\u2019t reach any of my immediate target squares this move.

No body, no collision, and the enemy can\u2019t bait a head-on if we keep this altitude.\n- LEFT to (0,6) feels like stalling in the corner\u2014sure, there\u2019s an apple at (0,5), but it would crowd us against the edge and hand Snake #0 the freedom to carve the middle while we fight our own tail for space.\n- DOWN takes us into the cramped lane around (1,5) with our own vertebrae nearby and their head creeping up column 1. That move tightens the noose and robs us of escape routes, so we pass.\n\nSo we\u2019re leaning into the safest, most aggressive path: climb toward (1,8), snag that apple, and keep the west wall press on deck.\n\nPlan note: After grabbing (1,8), ride the top row west to corral Snake #0 into his shrinking southern tunnel, then drop down through column 0/1 to seal the box and force them into their tail.

Best mobility + points. \ud83c\udf4e\u2728\n\nOpponent head at (1,6): can go UP toward (1,8) apple, LEFT to (0,6), or move down slowly \u2014 they can't contest (1,3) this turn. No immediate head-on risk if we go UP. \u2705\n\nWhy UP is the move:\n- We PICK an apple right now \u2014 more apples = more win leverage. \ud83d\ude24\n- After (1,3) we keep multiple safe exits (UP/LEFT/RIGHT) \u2014 keeps us flexible to box them later instead of trapping ourselves.\n- It helps us push vertically to control the x=1 column and potentially corral the rival toward the left wall. Want to box him on x\u22641? We need vertical presence \u2014 this move advances that plan. \ud83d\udce6\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Eat (1,3) this turn. Next, continue moving upward/right-left depending on opponent\u2019s choices to cut off their escape \u2014 priority is to maintain >=2 escape options at every step.\n- Use our body as a wall along x\u22652 if they try to squeeze; keep an escape lane along the left/bottom edges so we don\u2019t get boxed. Don\u2019t tunnel into the tight corridor near our current tail on the right.\n- If they commit toward the top or left, collapse the box and bait a head-on or force them into our body. GLHF \u2014 let\u2019s make them crash! \ud83d\udca5\n\nTime to grab that apple and keep the pressure. You ready? LET\u2019S GOOOO!!\n\nUP",

DOWN is a dead-end trap path. We take options and apples \u2014 not one-way alleyways.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Move UP to (0,5) to eat and keep two exits. Then react: if the enemy drifts right/down, push UP\u2192(0,6) to maintain the left wall and force them east; if they crowd up, slide RIGHT to (1,5) to cut off their lanes and create the funnel. Always keep >=2 exits unless a guaranteed kill appears.

We still have time to pivot if (1,6) clears.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Climb: UP \u2192 (0,6) then push to (0,7)/(0,8)/(0,9) while watching (1,6)/(1,7)/(2,8) movements.\n- If (1,6) or the opponent shifts down/right and opens lanes, pivot RIGHT near the top to cut them off and box their access to the high-value apples (4,9/5,9/8,9).\n- Avoid moving into cramped spaces with only 0\u20131 escapes unless we can guarantee a kill. Bait, then collapse. \ud83e\udea4\ud83d\udd25\n\nTime to execute \u2014 keep the apples and the W mindset.\n\nUP",

Worst-case: it\u2019s forced, but it\u2019s the right forced play. We avoid the tight lanes near our neck (1,6)/(2,6) so we don\u2019t get snared.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns \u2014 stash this as next-turn rationale):\nClimb to (0,9) and hold the top edge. From there, pressure right across y=9 to either contest the high apple at (8,9) or use the top edge to hem the opponent into the middle. Stay patient \u2014 we lead by apples, so avoid unnecessary head-on risks. Keep multiple escape routes open; only commit to a trap when we can force a head-on or block every exit.\n\nUP",

No risky head-on this turn: opponent head is at (7,9) far to the right and blocked by its own body to the left, so immediate collisions aren\u2019t a concern this turn.\n- Moving to (2,9) keeps us on the top row to contest the apple at (8,9) later and preserves options to drop down at x\u22482\u20134 where there\u2019s open space. We avoid getting boxed in for now and keep multiple follow-up exits available.\n- We must watch snake #1\u2019s approach along the top: if they push right we can contest the apple; if they loop down we can slip behind them. Don\u2019t commit to a head-on unless it guarantees their death or more apples.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Slide right along y=9 for a few turns to contest (8,9). If opponent commits into the top corridor we can either fight for the apple or peel down earlier into the open column at x=3\u20134 to avoid being trapped. Keep escape downwards available and avoid moving into cells adjacent to their head if they start closing the gap.\n\nRIGHT",

Illegal instant death. Don\u2019t be that guy. \u2716\ufe0f\n- UP \u2192 (2,10): off the board. Instant death. \ud83d\udc80\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,9): occupied by opponent #1\u2019s body (their segment sits there). Moving into any snake body = death. \ud83d\udeab\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,8): also occupied by opponent #1\u2019s body. Also deadly if treated as moving into a body.\n\nSo here\u2019s the cold truth: three moves are impossible/instant-death by the rules (LEFT is backwards, UP off-board, RIGHT into occupied cell), and DOWN is the only cardinal direction that isn\u2019t the backwards move or off-board. DOWN is still currently occupied by an opponent body segment, which means under strict \u201cinto-a-body = death\u201d rules we\u2019re toast whichever way we slice it. But we must choose\u2014so pick the option that preserves the most plausible hope of survival if the opponent\u2019s body shifts in a way that frees space, and that keeps our path off the congested top row.\n\nShort-term plan (what I\u2019ll try to force over the next few turns if we survive):\n- Drop down (try to escape the top-row sandwich), then weave into x=2\u20134 columns where there\u2019s slightly more breathing room and apples nearby. Avoid hugging the wall at x=0 again; being a corridor snack is how we lose.\n- Watch opponent #1\u2019s head moves \u2014 if they peel right we can slip behind; if they push down we gotta pivot quickly to avoid their closure. Prioritize survival > contesting apples for the next couple of turns.\n\nThis is a rough one \u2014 we\u2019re likely getting boxed, but DOWN is the only non-backwards, on-board direction that gives even a speck of potential flexibility. Time to gamble and try to wiggle outta the top-row trap.\n\nDOWN",
