It is a safe move.\n    *   **RIGHT (9, 9):** This cell is currently empty. It is a safe move.\n\n2.  **Analyze Backwards Move Constraint:**\n    *   My previous head position was (9, 9).\n    *   The cell behind my current head is (9, 9).\n    *   Moving RIGHT would take me to (9, 9), which is directly backwards. This is forbidden.\n    *   **RIGHT is eliminated.**\n\n3.  **Compare Remaining Safe Moves (DOWN vs LEFT):**\n    *   **DOWN (8, 8):**\n        *   Moves me into the open center of the board.\n        *   Neighbors include (7, 8), (9, 8), (8, 7).\n        *   Potential risk: The enemy snake #1 at (3, 4) is inactive (head=2, tail=2). However, if the enemy moves UP, they might reach (3, 5) or (2, 5), moving towards the board center.\n        *   The apple at (1, 9) is currently safe (blocked by wall).\n        *   The apple at (7, 3) is active (blocked by body and wall).\n        *   Keeping high y-coordinate (9) allows me to defend the top row apples ((1,9), (3,6)) against enemies coming from the center.\n\n    *   **LEFT (7, 9):**\n        *   Moves me to (7, 9).\n        *   This keeps me on the top row.\n        *   It puts me closer to the apple at (1, 9).\n        *   It maintains a position where I can potentially block enemies from reaching the top row apples.\n        *   My next moves from here would likely be LEFT or DOWN.\n        *   If I go LEFT to (6, 9), I remain safe.\n        *   If I go DOWN to (7, 8), I enter the open board.\n\n4.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   The goal is to survive and eat apples.\n    *   The apple at (1, 9) is very close if I continue LEFT. Since it is blocked by a wall, I can likely secure it if I reach it, while the enemy cannot.\n    *   The apple at (7, 3) is \"Active\". A \"vulnerable\" apple usually suggests an enemy might try to reach it. However, the enemy is at (3, 4) and quite far. They might be going for (4, 4).\n    *   By staying on the top row (choosing LEFT), I secure the position against the top apples.\n    *   If I go DOWN, I lose the top row position and might get into a scramble in the center. The enemy is already in the center.\n    *   Therefore, staying on the perimeter (Top Row) is a safer and more controlling strategy.\n\n5.  **Final Check:**\n    *   My head is at (8, 9).\n    *   Target: (1, 9) apple.\n    *   Next step: LEFT to (7, 9).\n    *   Future options: From (7, 9), I can go LEFT to (6, 9) or DOWN to (7, 8). Both will be safe (since I am moving forward).\n    *   No immediate collision with enemy.\n\nDecision: Move LEFT to continue towards the apple at (1, 9).\n\nLEFT",

It is the safest and closest apple. The enemy snake is at (4, 6), which is far away (4 spaces in X, 3 spaces in Y). They cannot intercept me.\n2.  **Next Moves:**\n    *   Current Position: (5, 9).\n    *   Move 1: **LEFT** to (4, 9).\n    *   Move 2: **LEFT** to (3, 9).\n    *   Move 3: **LEFT** to (2, 9).\n    *   Move 4: **LEFT** to (1, 9) -> **EAT APPLE**.\n3.  **Future Options:** After eating the apple at (1, 9), I can consider moving DOWN towards the center apples, or continue to the edge if needed.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe path to the left is clear. Moving LEFT gets me closer to the apple at (1, 9) and maintains my position on the top wall, which is generally safe.\n\nLEFT",

Bounds are x=0 to 9, y=0 to 9.\n3.  **Last Move:** The user says \"Your last move information... My previous head position was (4, 9)\" and \"START LAST MOVE PICK LEFT\". However, the board state clearly shows the head at (2, 9) and the apple at (1, 9) is still present. If the snake had moved LEFT from (4, 9) to (3, 9), it would be at (3, 9). If it moved LEFT again, it would be at (2, 9). The board shows (2, 9) is occupied by '0'. This implies the snake is at (2, 9). The text mentions the previous head was (4, 9) and the chosen move was LEFT, resulting in (3, 9). Then the text mentions moving LEFT again from (3, 9) to (2, 9). The board state confirms the head is at (2, 9). There is a discrepancy in the \"Last Move\" text description versus the board state (which shows the *current* state). I must trust the board state provided in the prompt as the absolute current reality.\n    *   *Self-correction:* The prompt says \"Turn: 9\". The \"Last Move\" section describes the move made for Turn 8 (resulting in current position). The board shows Head at (2, 9). The \"Last Move\" text says \"My previous head position was (4, 9)\" and \"move RIGHT to (4, 9)\" (which is contradictory to the move listed \"LEFT\"). Wait, the \"Last Rationale\" says \"My previous head position was (4, 9)\". It says \"My current target is the apple at (1, 9)\". It says \"LEFT (2, 9): Moves directly toward the target\". This implies the move from (3, 9) to (2, 9). I will assume the snake is currently at (2, 9) as per the board state.\n\n4.  **Safety Check (Turn 9):**\n    *   Head: (2, 9).\n    *   **UP (2, 10):** y=10 is out of bounds (max y=9). **DEADLY.**\n    *   **DOWN (2, 8):** Coordinate (2, 8). The board shows 'A' (Apple) at (2, 8). Apples are safe to enter. **SAFE.**\n    *   **LEFT (1, 9):** Coordinate (1, 9). The board shows 'A' (Apple) at (1, 9). **SAFE.**\n    *   **RIGHT (3, 9):** Coordinate (3, 9). The board shows '.' (Empty) at (3, 9). **SAFE.**\n\n5.  **Backwards Constraint:**\n    *   If the previous head position was (3, 9) (implied by move LEFT to get to 2,9 or by the board state of (3,9) being empty), then moving **LEFT** is the forward move.\n    *   If the previous head position was (1, 9), moving **RIGHT** is forward.\n    *   The text explicitly states: \"My previous head position was (4, 9)\" (Wait, this is impossible given the board state and the board history usually shown). Let's re-read carefully.\n        *   Board at Turn 9 shows Head at (2, 9).\n        *   Rationale says: \"My previous head position was (4, 9)\".\n        *   Rationale says: \"Moving RIGHT to (4, 9) would move me back... FORBIDDEN\".\n        *   Rationale says: \"LEFT (2, 9): Moves directly toward the target\".\n        *   This rationale is slightly confusing if taken literally, but the *conclusion* is that the head is moving from somewhere to (2, 9) or is at (2, 9).\n        *   Let's look at the board again.\n            Row 9: `. A 0 . . . . . . .` -> Indices 0 to 9.\n            Index 0: `.`\n            Index 1: `A` (Apple at 1,9)\n            Index 2: `0` (Snake head at 2,9)\n            Index 3: `.` (Empty at 3,9)\n            ...\n            The Rationale mentions \"Current Head: (3, 9)\" in step 1. This must be a typo in the rationale or referring to the state *before* the last move that is being reported. The board shows the result of the move.\n            If the head is at (2, 9), the previous head *must* have been (1, 9), (2, 8), or (3, 9).\n            Given the Rationale mentions \"LEFT (2, 9)\" as the move, and mentions \"Previous head (4, 9)\", this seems like a hallucination or error in the provided \"last move\" info.\n            *However*, I must play the turn from the *Board State*.\n            Current Head: (2, 9).\n            Potential moves:\n            *   UP: (2, 10) -> OUT OF BOUNDS.\n            *   DOWN: (2, 8) -> Contains 'A'.

Safe.\n\n6.  **Target Analysis:**\n    *   Apples: (7, 2), (1, 9), (7, 3), (1, 7), (2, 8).\n    *   My head: (2, 9).\n    *   (1, 9) is adjacent (Left).\n    *   (2, 8) is adjacent (Down).\n    *   (1, 7) is 2 steps away (Down-Left or Down-Down-Left).\n    *   Enemy Snake #1: Head (1, 6), Body [(2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6)].\n    *   Enemy is far away (y=6 vs my y=9). They cannot reach the top row apples this turn.\n\n7.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   I am at (2, 9).\n    *   I have two apples adjacent: (1, 9) and (2, 8).\n    *   (1, 9) is directly to the Left.\n    *   (2, 8) is directly Down.\n    *   Which one to take?\n        *   If I go Left to (1, 9): I eat an apple. I grow. My tail stays (if I didn't eat, it moves, but I did, so tail stays). The body will extend behind (2, 9). Next turn, I will be at (1, 9) with body segment at (2, 9). From (1, 9), I can go Left (0, 9), Down (1, 8), or Right (2, 9) - but Right would be back into my new body segment (if I haven't moved tail yet) or empty. Wait, the body fills in the old head spot. So from (1, 9), (2, 9) will be my body. So I cannot go Right.\n        *   If I go Down to (2, 8): I eat an apple. I grow. Head moves to (2, 8). Body segment at (2, 9). Next turn, from (2, 8), I can go Down (2, 7), Left (1, 8), Right (3, 8). I cannot go Up (2, 9) because that's my body.\n    *   Both moves are valid and safe.\n    *   Is there any difference?\n        *   (1, 9) is at the edge (x=1). Left of it is (0, 9), then (0, 10) is out. It's a corner-ish area.\n        *   (2, 8) is more central.\n    *   Let's look at the board:\n        Row 9: `0 A 0 .`\n        Row 8: `. . A .`\n        Row 7: `. A .`\n        The apple at (1, 9) is isolated. The apple at (2, 8) is near the apple at (1, 7) and (1, 9) and (1, 8). Wait, (1, 8) is empty. (2, 7) is empty.\n        Actually, going Left to (1, 9) puts me next to a wall. Going Down to (2, 8) keeps me in the open area of the top row.\n        Let's check the \"Rationale\" provided. It says: \"My current target is the apple at (1, 9).\" and \"LEFT (2, 9): Moves directly toward the target\".\n        The \"Last Move Info\" implies that the intended direction was LEFT (towards 1,9).\n        However, I am currently at (2, 9). To get to (1, 9), I move LEFT.\n        To get to (2, 8), I move DOWN.\n        Both are safe.\n        Let's check the \"Backwards Constraint\". If I am at (2, 9), and I came from... where?\n        If I came from (3, 9), I cannot go back to (3, 9) (Right).\n        If I came from (2, 10), I cannot go back (Up) - but Up is impossible anyway.\n        If I came from (1, 9), I cannot go back (Left).\n        If I came from (2, 8), I cannot go back (Down).\n        Since the board shows (3, 9) is empty, and (1, 9) is an apple, and (2, 8) is an apple, and (2, 10) is out of bounds...\n        It is most likely I came from (3, 9) or I started there.\n        If I came from (3, 9), I can go Left, Down, Up (deadly), Right (backwards).\n        The Rationale mentions \"My previous head position was (4, 9)\" which is weird, but also mentions \"Current Head: (3, 9)\" in step 1. This is contradictory to the board state.\n        *Let's ignore the specific \"Last Move\" text details about previous coordinates if they conflict with the board, but respect the \"Board State\" image as the absolute truth.*\n        Board: Head at (2, 9). Empty at (3, 9). Apple at (1, 9). Apple at (2, 8).\n        I can go Left or Down.\n        The \"Rationale\" section explicitly targets (1, 9).\n        \"Current distance: 2 moves (Left, Left).\" -> This implies (1, 9) is the target.\n        \"LEFT (2, 9): Moves directly toward the target\". -> This is the logic for the next move.\n        Wait, I am currently at (2, 9). The target is (1, 9). One move Left.\n        If I am at (2, 9), and I move Left, I go to (1, 9).\n        So the logic holds: Move LEFT.\n\n        Let's double check if there are any threats.\n        Snake #1 is at (1, 6) with body (2,6), (3,6), (4,6).\n        They are 3 units away in Y.\n        They can move Up, Down, Left, Right.\n        Max distance they can cover in one turn is 1.\n        They cannot reach me (y=9) this turn.\n        They cannot reach the apples at y=9 (1,9) or (2,8) this turn.\n        So I am competing only against myself for the apple.\n        Both (1, 9) and (2, 8) are free.\n        The \"Last Rationale\" text strongly suggests the strategy is to take (1, 9).\n        \"My current target is the apple at (1, 9).\"\n        \"LEFT (2, 9): Moves directly toward the target apple.\"\n        This logic is sound if my head was previously at (3, 9) or (2, 10). But I am at (2, 9).\n        If I am at (2, 9), moving Left takes me to (1, 9).\n        This matches the target.\n        Therefore, LEFT is the intended move.\n\n        Wait, look at the board again.\n        Row 9: `. A 0 .`\n        Index 0: .\n        Index 1: A (1,9)\n        Index 2: 0 (2,9)\n        Index 3: . (3,9)\n        My head is at index 2.\n        Target is at index 1.\n        Direction: LEFT.\n\n        Is there any reason to choose DOWN instead?\n        Down leads to (2, 8). There is an apple there.\n        Both are safe.\n        The prompt asks me to explain my reasoning.\n        The \"Last Move\" info is a bit messy with coordinates, but the *intent* is clear: Target (1, 9).\n        I will stick to the strategy of taking the apple at (1, 9) if safe.\n        It is safe.\n\n        Let's verify the \"Backwards Constraint\" carefully for the current turn (Turn 9).\n        My head is at (2, 9).\n        The \"Last Move\" text says \"My previous head position was (4, 9)\".\n        This is impossible given the board state (Head at 2,9).\n        However, the text also says \"DOWN (3, 8): Cell is empty. SAFE.\" in the \"Immediate Safety Check\" of the *previous* rationale. This implies the previous head was at (3, 9). If the previous head was at (3, 9), then (3, 9) is the \"backwards\" direction. Since (3, 9) is currently empty, it's a valid move *back* to where I came from (if I was there).\n        If I was at (3, 9), and I moved Left to (2, 9), then (3, 9) is the \"previous cell\".\n        If I move Right now, I go back to (3, 9). This is forbidden.\n        If I move Left, I go to (1, 9).\n        If I move Down, I go to (2, 8).\n        So I cannot move Right.\n        I can move Left or Down.\n        The \"Rationale\" explicitly says \"LEFT (2, 9): Moves directly toward the target apple. It is the optimal choice to secure the apple next turn.\"\n        Since I must output the move for the *current* turn, and the current head is at (2, 9), and the target is (1, 9), the move is LEFT.\n\n        One final check: Are there any other apples?\n        (7, 2), (1, 9), (7, 3), (1, 7), (2, 8).\n        (1, 9) is the closest/easiest if I am at (2, 9).\n        (2, 8) is also adjacent.\n        The \"Last Rationale\" text seems to be a template or a previous thought process where the snake was at (3, 9) or (4, 9). But the *conclusion* of that rationale was \"LEFT\".\n        And the board shows the snake is at (2, 9).\n        If the snake is at (2, 9) and wants to execute the \"LEFT\" strategy to get to (1, 9), then the move is simply LEFT.\n\n        Let's verify if I am at (2, 9).\n        Board line: `9 . A 0 . . . . . . .`\n        This is row 9.\n        x=0: .\n        x=1: A\n        x=2: 0\n        x=3: .\n        ...\n        So Head is at (2, 9). Confirmed.\n\n        Previous position?\n        If the head moved from (3, 9) to (2, 9), then (3, 9) is the tail segment (unless I ate).\n        If I ate at (2, 9), I wouldn't have a tail segment added at (3, 9).\n        The board shows `.` at (3, 9).\n        So I likely moved from (3, 9) to (2, 9) and ate the apple at (2, 9)? No, apples are at (1, 9) and (2, 8).\n        So I moved from (3, 9) to (2, 9) and did *not* eat.\n        Wait, if I didn't eat, my tail should have moved from somewhere else to (3, 9) or (2, 9) to (3, 9).\n        Actually, the board state is just the static state *after* moves.\n        It's Turn 9.\n        Let's assume the \"Last Move\" info is from Turn 8.\n        Rationale: \"My previous head position was (4, 9)\" -> \"Moving LEFT to (4, 9)\" -> This text is garbled.\n        Rationale: \"Immediate Safety Check (Current Head: (3, 9))\".\n        Rationale: \"LEFT (2, 9)\".\n        This looks like the logic was for moving from (3, 9) to (2, 9).\n        So at the start of Turn 8, head was at (3, 9).\n        Move was LEFT -> Result (2, 9).\n        So at Start of Turn 9, head is at (2, 9).\n        This matches the board.\n        So the \"backwards\" direction is RIGHT (to 3, 9).\n        Target is (1, 9).\n        Move is LEFT.\n\n        Final check: Is (1, 9) safe from enemies?\n        Enemy #1 at (1, 6). Distance is 3 in Y.\n        Enemy cannot reach (1, 9) this turn.\n        Therefore, it is safe.\n\n        Decision: Move LEFT.\n\n        Wait, looking at the board again.\n        Snake #1 is at y=6.\n        Apple at (1, 9) and (2, 8).\n        I am at (2, 9).\n        The enemy is far away.\n        I should take the apple.\n        Left is the direction.\n\n        The prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\n        I will output LEFT.\n\n        Wait, I should double check the \"Multi-apple\" aspect.\n        If I move LEFT, I eat (1, 9). I grow. Next turn I am at (1, 9) with body at (2, 9).\n        If I move DOWN, I eat (2, 8). I grow. Next turn I am at (2, 8) with body at (2, 9).\n        Both are good.\n        The \"Last Rationale\" strongly hints at LEFT.\n        I will follow the hint. It seems to be a continuity of a thought process.\n\n        One minor detail: \"My previous head position was (4, 9)\". This is likely a hallucination in the prompt's \"Rationale\" text, possibly from a different game state or simulation. I must ignore coordinates that don't match the board. I rely on the board: Head at (2, 9).\n        Backwards constraint: If I came from (3, 9), I cannot go Right.\n        I am at (2, 9).\n        Target: (1, 9).\n        Move: LEFT.\n\n        Wait, could the \"Last Move\" info be fake? \"Your last move information... START LAST MOVE PICK LEFT\".\n        Okay, the user is confirming the *previous* move was LEFT.\n        If the previous move was LEFT, and the head is now at (2, 9), then the previous head was (3, 9).\n        This is consistent.\n\n        So:\n        Current Head: (2, 9).\n        Previous Head: (3, 9).\n        Cannot go RIGHT (backwards).\n        Can go UP (Deadly), LEFT (Safe), DOWN (Safe).\n        Target: (1, 9).\n        Move: LEFT.\n\n        I'll write a plan.\n        Target (1, 9).\n        Avoid Backwards (Right).\n        Avoid Out of Bounds (Up).\n        Prefer (1, 9) over (2, 8) as per the provided thought process (Rationale).\n\n        Double check coordinates.\n        X increases to the right. Y increases up.\n        (2, 9) is head.\n        (1, 9) is left.\n        (3, 9) is right.\n        (2, 8) is down.\n        (2, 10) is up.\n\n        Plan: Move Left to eat the apple at (1, 9). This was the plan in the previous turn's rationale and is still the best move. The enemy is far away.\n\n        One edge case: What if the enemy moves UP to (1, 7) and then next turn... no, they are at (1, 6). They can't reach (1, 9) in one turn.\n        What if another snake spawns? No, \"Enemy snakes\" lists only #1.\n        What if I miss something?\n        \"If two snake heads move into the same cell... both die.\"\n        I am moving to (1, 9). Enemy cannot reach it. Safe.\n\n        The prompt is very long and contains a lot of context. The \"Last Rationale\" seems to be a generic template or from a specific previous state. I will extract the useful parts:\n        - Current Head: (2, 9) (from Board).\n        - Backwards: (3, 9) (inferred from \"Last Move Left\" + Board).\n        - Target: (1, 9) (from Rationale text).\n        - Safe moves: Left, Down.\n        - Best move per Rationale: Left.\n\n        So the decision is LEFT.\n\n        Wait, the prompt says \"You are controlling a snake... Turn 9\".\n        The \"Last Move Info\" section is very specific. It says \"My previous head position was (4, 9)\" which is impossible.\n        But it also says \"Current Head: (3, 9)\" which is also impossible given the board.\n        This suggests the \"Last Move Info\" block is generated based on the *intended* move of the previous turn, not necessarily the *actual* resulting state if I was hallucinating or if the simulation had an error.\n        However, I MUST trust the Board State provided.\n        Board State: Head at (2, 9).\n        I will proceed with that.\n\n        Is it possible the snake is actually at (3, 9) and the board is wrong? No, \"Board state\" is the ground truth.\n        Is it possible the snake is at (2, 9) and the board is right?\n        Yes.\n        So, from (2, 9), I need to move.\n        Left -> (1, 9) Apple. Safe.\n        Down -> (2, 8) Apple. Safe.\n        Right -> (3, 9) Empty. Safe? If I came from (3, 9), this is backwards. \"My previous head position was (4, 9)\" implies I came from 4->3->2? No, 4->3->2 is impossible in 1 turn (Turn 8 to 9).\n        Actually, if I am at (2, 9) and the last move was LEFT, then I came from (3, 9).\n        So RIGHT is forbidden.\n        UP is forbidden.\n        So LEFT or DOWN.\n        The \"Last Rationale\" says \"LEFT (2, 9): Moves directly toward the target apple.\"\n        This implies the move to take is LEFT.\n\n        I will choose LEFT.\n\n        One check on the \"Last Rationale\" text:\n        \"My current target is the apple at (1, 9).\"\n        \"Current distance: 2 moves (Left, Left).\"\n        Wait. If I am at (2, 9), distance to (1, 9) is 1 move.\n        If the text says \"2 moves\", it implies I am at (3, 9).\n        But the Board says I am at (2, 9).\n        This is a strong contradiction.\n        If I am at (3, 9), I can move LEFT to (2, 9).\n        If I am at (2, 9), I can move LEFT to (1, 9).\n        If the \"Rationale\" thinks I am at (3, 9), it would say \"Move Left\".\n        If I am at (2, 9), I should move Left to get the apple.\n        If I am at (2, 9) and I move Left, I get the apple.\n        If I am at (2, 9) and I move Down, I get the apple.\n        Which one is better?\n        (1, 9) is a wall apple. (2, 8) is an inner apple.\n        (1, 9) is closer to (1, 7) (2 steps away via 1,8). (2, 8) is closer to (1, 7) (1 step via 1,8 or 2,7).\n        Actually, (1, 7) is directly below (1, 9) and (2, 8).\n        If I am at (1, 9), I have a body at (2, 9). I can go DOWN to (1, 8). Then (1, 7).\n        If I am at (2, 8), I have a body at (2, 9). I can go DOWN to (2, 7). Then (1, 7). Or LEFT to (1, 8).\n        The \"Rationale\" text is very specific about targeting (1, 9).\n        \"My current target is the apple at (1, 9).\"\n        \"LEFT (2, 9): Moves directly toward the target apple.\"\n        Even if the distance reasoning is slightly off (due to the board/rationale mismatch), the *intent* is to get (1, 9).\n        Since I am at (2, 9), moving Left gets (1, 9).\n        So I will move Left.\n\n        Is there any reason to prefer (2, 8)?\n        The enemy is at (1, 6). If I go to (1, 9), I am directly above the enemy's X coordinate. If they move up aggressively, I might be in a funnel. But I am at y=9. They are at y=6. They need 3 turns to reach me. I will be long gone (eating apples).\n        Also, I will have length 2 by then. Space is tight at the edge, but manageable for a short snake.\n        The prompt says \"prefer moves that... keep future options open\".\n        (2, 8) is more open than (1, 9). (1, 9) has a wall to the left.\n        However, (1, 9) is the target identified in the prompt's thought process.\n        If I deviate from the prompt's logic without a clear reason, I might be missing something.\n        But the prompt's logic has a coordinate error (saying distance is 2 when it's 1 if board is correct).\n        Let's assume the board is correct. I am at (2, 9).\n        Option A: Left (1, 9). Wall on left. Wall on top. Corners are risky. But I eat an apple.\n        Option B: Down (2, 8). Open to left and right. Eat an apple.\n        Option C: Right (3, 9). Forbidden (backwards).\n        Option D: Up (2, 10). Deadly.\n\n        Let's look at the board again.\n        Row 8: `. . A . . . . . . .`\n        Index 1 is empty.\n        Row 7: `. A . . . . . . . .`\n        Index 1 is Apple.\n\n        If I go to (1, 9):\n        I am at edge. Next turn, I can go Down (1, 8) or Left (0, 9) or Right (2, 9) - blocked by body.\n        (0, 9) is a corner.\n        (1, 8) is empty.\n        If I go to (2, 8):\n        Next turn, I can go Down (2, 7), Left (1, 8), Right (3, 8).\n        (1, 8) is empty.\n        (2, 7) is empty.\n        (3, 8) is empty.\n\n        (2, 8) seems slightly safer because it has 3 exits vs (1, 9) which effectively has 2 (Left is a corner).\n        However, the prompt explicitly sets the target to (1, 9).\n        \"My current target is the apple at (1, 9).\"\n        \"LEFT (2, 9): Moves directly toward the target apple.\"\n        This strongly implies I should take (1, 9).\n        Maybe the wall isn't an issue because I can just eat and leave?\n        If I take (1, 9), I am at (1, 9). Next turn I can go Down to (1, 8). Then Down to (1, 7) to eat another apple. This is a straight line.\n        If I take (2, 8), I am at (2, 8).

A 0 .`\n        If '0' is at index 2, it's (2, 9).\n        If '0' was at index 3, it would be (3, 9).\n        It is at index 2.\n        So (2, 9).\n        Target is (1, 9).\n        Move is LEFT.\n\n        I will output LEFT.Based on the board state and the strategy to target the apple at (1, 9), the snake should move LEFT to collect the apple. This move is safe as the enemy snake is too far away to contest the top row. Moving DOWN to (2, 8) is also safe but diverges from the current target of (1, 9).\n\nContinue strategy to collect apples at (1, 9) and then (1, 7).\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "First, I need to understand the current board state and my position. My snake (ID 0) has its head at (0, 9) and body at [(1, 9)]. The apples are at (7, 2), (7, 3), (2, 8), (0, 8), and (9, 4). Snake #1 is at head (1, 8) with body [(1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6)].\n\nFrom the board visualization:\n\n- Row 9: 0 T . . . . . . . . \u2192 This shows my head at (0,9) as '0' and my body at (1,9) as 'T'. The '.' are empty spaces.\n\n- Row 8: A 1 A . . . . . . . \u2192 This shows an apple at (0,8) as 'A', snake #1's head at (1,8) as '1', and another apple at (2,8) as 'A'. So, (0,8) and (2,8) are apples.\n\nIn the last move, I was at head (2,9) and moved LEFT to (1,9), but now my head is at (0,9)? That doesn't match. Let me check the last move information.\n\nIn the last move rationale, it says: \"My head is at (2, 9). The nearest apple is at (1, 9). Moving LEFT collects the apple and grows my snake.\" But in the current state, my head is at (0,9) and body at (1,9). So, after moving LEFT from (2,9) to (1,9), I collected the apple at (1,9)? But in the apples list, (1,9) is not listed; the apples are at (7,2), (7,3), (2,8), (0,8), (9,4). There's no apple at (1,9). I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps the board state has changed after my move. Let me read carefully.\n\nThe current state says: \"Your snake (ID 0): - Head: (0, 9) - Body: [(1, 9)]\" and apples include (0,8) and (2,8), but not (1,9). So, in the last move, I moved LEFT from (2,9) to (1,9), but since there was no apple at (1,9), I didn't grow, so my body is now only [(1,9)]? But if I moved from (2,9) to (1,9), and I had one apple collected already, my body should have been longer. Let's see the scores: I have 1 apple, so I should have a body of length 1 after eating one apple? Typically, the snake starts with length 1 (just head), and after eating an apple, it grows by one segment, so body length should be 1 after one apple. But here, body is listed as [(1,9)], which is one segment, so that makes sense. But when I move, my body follows, so after moving from (2,9) to (1,9), my previous head position (2,9) becomes part of the body, so body should be [(2,9)]? But the body is listed as [(1,9)]. That implies that (1,9) is the body segment, meaning that after moving, the head is at (1,9) and body is the previous head position? But in the current state, head is at (0,9), so something doesn't add up.\n\nI think there's a misunderstanding. Let's look at the board state from the visualization:\n\nRow 9: 0 T . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, at (0,9): '0' which is my head? But '0' typically represents the head, and 'T' represents the tail? But in the description, it says \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one, and the last tuple is the tail.\" So for my snake, head is (0,9), body is [(1,9)], so the body list has only one element, which is (1,9), so that means the tail is at (1,9)? But in the board, (0,9) has '0' and (1,9) has 'T', so 'T' might be the tail, and '0' is the head. But if body is [(1,9)], then after head, the body segment is at (1,9), which is the tail since it's only one segment. So when I move, if I move from (0,9) to some direction, my body will shift.\n\nBut in the last move, I moved from (2,9) to (1,9), but now head is at (0,9)? That means between last move and current state, another move happened? No, the current state is after my last move? Let's see the turn: Turn 11 / 150. And this is the state for turn 11? Or is this the state before my move for turn 11? The message says \"Turn: 11 / 150\" and then \"Your last move information\" which is from turn 10? Let's see the structure.\n\nThe user says: \"Turn: 11 / 150\" and then provides the current state, including my snake and enemy snake positions. Then it says \"Your last move information\" which is from turn 10? Because it says \"My last move\" and \"last move pick\" etc. So, for turn 11, I need to decide my move for turn 11.\n\nIn the last move rationale, it says: \"My head is at (2, 9).\" but in the current state for turn 11, my head is at (0,9). So, after my last move (which was LEFT from (2,9) to (1,9)), the game must have advanced, and snake #1 also moved, and now for turn 11, my head is at (0,9)? But from the board, row 9 has '0' at (0,9), so my head is at (0,9). How did I get from (1,9) to (0,9)? I must have moved again? But the last move was for turn 10, and now for turn 11, I'm at (0,9)? That doesn't make sense because between turns, snakes move simultaneously, so after my move for turn 10, I should be at (1,9) if I moved LEFT from (2,9), but then for turn 11, I need to decide my move from (1,9)? But the current state says head at (0,9), so perhaps I moved again? I think there's a mistake in my interpretation.\n\nLet's read the last move rationale carefully: \"My head is at (2, 9). The nearest apple is at (1, 9). Moving LEFT collects the apple and grows my snake.\" But in the apples list for the current state, there is no apple at (1,9). The apples are at (7,2), (7,3), (2,8), (0,8), (9,4). So, at (1,9) there is no apple. So why did I think there was an apple? Perhaps in the previous turn, there was an apple at (1,9), and I collected it, so now it's gone? But in the current state, apples are listed, and (1,9) is not in the list, so after I collected it, it's removed. So, in turn 10, I moved LEFT from (2,9) to (1,9), collected the apple at (1,9), so I grew, and now for turn 11, my head is at (1,9) and body includes (2,9)? But the current state says head is at (0,9) and body at [(1,9)]. So, after collecting the apple, my body should be longer. Let's see the body length.\n\nTypically, when a snake eats an apple, it grows, meaning that after moving to the apple, the body length increases by one. So, if before move, head at (2,9), body [(1,9)]? But from the last move rationale, it doesn't specify the body before move. Let's assume from the scores: I have 1 apple, so before any moves, I had 1 apple? But the game started with turn 1, and we are at turn 11, so I have collected one apple so far. In the last move, I collected another apple? But the scores say \"Your snake (ID 0) apples: 1\" and \"Snake #1 apples: 4\", so I have only 1 apple, meaning that in the last move, I did not collect an apple? But the last move rationale says I moved to collect an apple at (1,9), but if I collected it, my apples should be 2, but it's still 1. So, contradiction.\n\nPerhaps the last move rationale is from a previous turn, and the current state is after that move? But the turn is 11, and last move information is for turn 10? Let's look at the user message: \"Turn: 11 / 150\" and then \"Your last move information\" which includes the move I made for turn 10? So, for turn 10, I moved LEFT from (2,9) to (1,9), and since there was an apple at (1,9), I collected it, so my apples should increase to 2, but in the current state for turn 11, my apples are still 1? That doesn't make sense.\n\nI think there's a error in the provided information. Let's ignore the last move rationale for a moment and focus on the current state for turn 11.\n\nFrom current state:\n- My snake: head (0,9), body [(1,9)], apples: 1\n- Snake #1: head (1,8), body [(1,7), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)], apples: 4\n- Apples: (7,2), (7,3), (2,8), (0,8), (9,4)\n\nFrom the board visualization:\n- (0,9): head of snake 0\n- (1,9): body of snake 0\n- (1,8): head of snake 1\n- (1,7): body of snake 1\n- (1,6): body of snake 1\n- (2,6): body of snake 1\n- (3,6): body of snake 1\n- Apples: at (0,8) from row 8, at (2,8) from row 8, at (0,8) is listed, at (2,8) is listed, and from other rows, (7,2) from row 2, (7,3) from row 3, (9,4) from row 4.\n\nSo, for my snake at (0,9) with body at (1,9), I need to choose a move for turn 11.\n\nNow, let's consider possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nFirst, check for immediate death:\n\n- If I move UP: from (0,9) to (0,10)? But board is from 0 to 9, so y=10 is outside, so I die. So UP is invalid.\n\n- If I move DOWN: from (0,9) to (0,8). What is at (0,8)? From apples list, (0,8) is an apple. Also, from board, row 8 has 'A' at (0,8), so it's an apple. So, if I move down to (0,8), I would eat the apple, so I grow and gain a point. But is there any snake there? From current state, snake #1 has head at (1,8) and body at (1,7), (1,6), etc., so (0,8) is empty except for the apple. So, moving DOWN seems safe and I eat an apple.\n\n- If I move LEFT: from (0,9) to (-1,9)? x=-1 is outside, so I die. So LEFT is invalid.\n\n- If I move RIGHT: from (0,9) to (1,9). But (1,9) is my own body segment? From my snake, body is at (1,9), so if I move into my own body, I die. So RIGHT is invalid because I would hit my own body.\n\nSo, only DOWN seems safe? But let's confirm: when I move DOWN to (0,8), I eat the apple, so I grow. But since I'm moving, my body will follow. Currently, my body is at (1,9). After I move to (0,8), my body will shift: the new head is (0,8), and the body will include the previous head (0,9) and the previous body (1,9)? But since I grew, the tail might not move immediately? Let's think about snake movement.\n\nIn Snake games, when you move, the head moves to the new cell, and if you eat an apple, you grow, meaning that the tail does not move for that turn. So, after moving to (0,8), my new body should be: [ (0,9), (1,9) ]? But since I grew, the body length increases by one, so the tail stays at (1,9), and I add the previous head to the body. So, new body: [ (0,9), (1,9) ]? But (1,9) was the only body segment, so after adding (0,9), body becomes [ (0,9), (1,9) ], so tail is (1,9). But in terms of coordinate list, head is (0,8), body is [ (0,9), (1,9) ], so when I move, if I don't eat, I would move head and shift body, but since I eat, I add the previous head to body without removing the tail.\n\nSo, for moving DOWN to (0,8), it seems safe, and I eat an apple.\n\nBut are there any other dangers? For example, snake #1 might move and collide with me? But since moves are simultaneous, I need to consider where snake #1 might move.\n\nSnake #1 has head at (1,8). Possible moves for snake #1: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- If snake #1 moves UP: to (1,9). But (1,9) is my body segment? So, if snake #1 moves to (1,9), it would hit my body, so snake #1 would die, and I remain alive. So, if I stay at (0,8) or move to (0,8), and snake #1 moves to (1,9), I'm safe because it hits my body, not my head.\n\n- If snake #1 moves DOWN: to (1,7). But (1,7) is currently occupied by its own body? From snake #1 body, (1,7) is the first body segment, so if it moves DOWN to (1,7), it would hit its own body? Let's see: head is at (1,8), body includes (1,7), so if it moves DOWN to (1,7), it would move into its own body, so it would die. So, snake #1 cannot move DOWN because it would hit itself.\n\n- If snake #1 moves LEFT: to (0,8). But (0,8) is where I might move? If I move to (0,8), and snake #1 moves to (0,8), then both heads move to the same cell, so both snakes die. So, if I move DOWN to (0,8), and snake #1 moves LEFT to (0,8, we would both die. So, I need to avoid that.\n\n- If snake #1 moves RIGHT: to (2,8). (2,8) is an apple, so if snake #1 moves to (2,8), it would eat the apple and grow. But (2,8) is currently empty except for apple? From board, at (2,8), there is an apple, and no snake body? Snake #1 body is at (1,7), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), so (2,8) is empty. So, if snake #1 moves RIGHT to (2,8), it would eat the apple and survive.\n\nSo, for snake #1, possible moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT? But LEFT might cause head-on collision if I move to (0,8). And UP to (1,9) would hit my body, so snake #1 dies. RIGHT to (2,8) is safe for snake #1.\n\nNow, back to my move. If I move DOWN to (0,8), I eat the apple, but if snake #1 moves LEFT to (0,8), we both die. So, is it safe to move DOWN? It depends on what snake #1 does.\n\nBut since I don't know what snake #1 will do, I need to consider the probability or avoid moves that could lead to death.\n\nIf I move DOWN, and snake #1 moves LEFT, we both die. If snake #1 moves UP or RIGHT, I survive and eat the apple.\n\nIf I don't move DOWN, what are my other options? From earlier, UP and LEFT are invalid because they kill me immediately. RIGHT is invalid because I hit my own body. So, only DOWN is possible? But if I move DOWN, there is a risk of head-on collision with snake #1 if it moves LEFT.\n\nBut is there any other move? Perhaps I should stay? But in Snake game, you must move each turn; you cannot stay. So, I have to choose one of the four directions.\n\nSo, only DOWN seems available, but with risk.\n\nBut let's confirm if RIGHT is really invalid? My head at (0,9), moving RIGHT to (1,9). (1,9) is my own body segment, so yes, I would hit myself, so I die. So, RIGHT is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, UP and LEFT are out of bounds.\n\nSo, only DOWN is possible? But if I move DOWN, and snake #1 moves LEFT, I die. But if snake #1 moves UP or RIGHT, I survive.\n\nNow, what would snake #1 likely do? Snake #1 has apples: 4, so it might want to eat more apples. There is an apple at (2,8), which is to its RIGHT, so moving RIGHT would eat that apple. Also, there is an apple at (0,8), which is to its LEFT, so moving LEFT would eat that apple. But moving LEFT risks head-on collision with me if I move to (0,8). But snake #1 doesn't know what I will do? From the perspective of snake #1, it sees my head at (0,9) and body at (1,9). If snake #1 considers moving LEFT to (0,8), it might see that I might move to (0,8) as well, so it might avoid moving LEFT to avoid death.\n\nSimilarly, moving UP to (1,9) would hit my body, so it dies immediately. So, snake #1 would not move UP because that kills itself. Similarly, moving DOWN to (1,7) hits its own body, so it dies. So, snake #1 has only two safe moves: LEFT to (0,8) or RIGHT to (2,8). But LEFT has risk of head-on collision if I also move to (0,8), so if snake #1 is smart, it might avoid LEFT and move RIGHT to eat the apple at (2,8) safely.\n\nIf snake #1 moves RIGHT, it eats the apple at (2,8) and grows, and I move DOWN to (0,8) and eat the apple at (0,8), so both survive and eat apples.\n\nIf snake #1 moves LEFT, we both die if I move to (0,8).\n\nSo, from snake #1's perspective, moving RIGHT is safer because it doesn't risk collision with me, and it eats an apple. Moving LEFT risks death if I move to (0,8). Since snake #1 has already 4 apples, it might want to avoid risk and go for the safe apple.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that snake #1 will move RIGHT to (2,8).\n\nThus, if I move DOWN to (0,8), I likely eat the apple and survive.\n\nBut is there any other consideration? What about future moves? After I move to (0,8), my new head is at (0,8), body is [ (0,9), (1,9) ]. Now, from there, I need to plan future moves.\n\nBut for this turn, since I have no other choice, I should move DOWN.\n\nBut let's double-check if there is any other safe move. What about moving to other directions? I already considered, but only DOWN seems valid.\n\nPerhaps I can move to another direction if I consider the body movement? No, from my current position, only DOWN is into an empty cell with apple.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, I need to ensure that after my move, I don't hit any other snake's body. But since I'm moving to (0,8), which is currently empty except for apple, and snake #1 is at (1,8), which is adjacent, but since we move simultaneously, I need to see where snake #1 moves.\n\nBut as above, if snake #1 moves to (0,8), we collide. But if it moves to (2,8), we don't.\n\nSo, to avoid death, I might consider not moving to (0,8) if I think snake #1 will move there. But I have no other moves! UP, LEFT, RIGHT are all invalid because they kill me immediately. So, I must move DOWN, and hope that snake #1 does not move LEFT.\n\nBut in terms of strategy, since I have no choice, I have to take the risk.\n\nBut let's see the apples: there is another apple at (2,8), but I cannot reach it directly from (0,9) without going through (1,9), which is my body.\n\nSo, for turn 11, I must move DOWN.\n\nNow, for the long-term plan, after moving to (0,8), I will have head at (0,8), body at [ (0,9), (1,9) ]. Then, I can consider moving to other directions to get to other apples. For example, from (0,8), I can move RIGHT to (1,8), but (1,8) is where snake #1 head is? After moves, snake #1 might be at (2,8) if it moved RIGHT, so (1,8) might be empty? Let's see: if snake #1 moves RIGHT to (2,8), then from (1,8), it moves to (2,8), so (1,8) becomes empty? But since snake #1 moves, its body shifts: after moving to (2,8), its new body would include the previous head (1,8) and previous body segments? So, if it moves RIGHT, new head at (2,8), body: [ (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (2,6) ]? But (2,6) was already body, so after moving, the tail might move? Since it ate an apple, it grows, so the tail does not move, so body becomes [ (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (2,6) ]? But (3,6) might be removed? Let's think carefully.\n\nWhen a snake moves and eats an apple, it grows: the head moves to the new cell, and the body adds the previous head position without removing the tail. So, for snake #1, if it moves from (1,8) to (2,8) and eats the apple, its new head is (2,8), and new body is [ (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (2,6) ]? But originally, body was [ (1,7), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6) ], so after adding the previous head (1,8), the body becomes [ (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (2,6) ], and the tail (3,6) is gone? No, in snake growth, when you eat, you add one segment, so the body length increases by one. So, from head at (1,8) and body of 4 segments? Let's see the body list: [(1,7), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6)] so 4 body segments, meaning the snake has length 5 (head + 4 body). After eating, length becomes 6, so body should have 5 segments. After moving to (2,8), the new body should be: [ (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6) ]? But that would be 5 body segments, so length 6. Yes, so the tail remains at (3,6) because we grew, so we don't remove the tail. So, after snake #1 moves to (2,8), its body is [ (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6) ].\n\nSimilarly for my snake: after I move to (0,8), I eat an apple, so I grow. My current length: head and one body segment, so length 2. After eating, length 3, so body should have two segments. After moving to (0,8), new head is (0,8), and new body is [ (0,9), (1,9) ]? Since I added the previous head (0,9) to the body, and the previous body (1,9) remains, so yes, body [ (0,9), (1,9) ], so tail is (1,9).\n\nNow, back to turn 11 move: I must move DOWN to (0,8).\n\nSo, for the decision, I think DOWN is the only safe move, and it has a chance to eat an apple, with risk of collision only if snake #1 moves LEFT, which is unlikely.\n\nTherefore, I will move DOWN.\n\nBut let's confirm the board state once more. From the board visualization, at (0,8), there is an apple, and no snake, so yes.\n\nAlso, note that there is an apple at (2,8), which snake #1 might go for.\n\nSo, for my move, I choose DOWN.\n\nNow, for the long-term plan, I should note that after this move, I will be at (0,8) with body [ (0,9), (1,9) ], and I should plan to get to other apples, like (2,8) or (7,2) etc., but need to avoid snake #1.\n\nBut since the plan is for future turns, I can write a short plan.\n\nSo, my move: DOWN\n\nLong-term plan: After moving to (0,8), I will have a body blocking (1,9). From (0,8), I can move RIGHT to (1,8) if it's safe, or DOWN to (0,7), etc. I need to reach other apples while avoiding snake #1.\n\nBut for now, for turn 11, I move DOWN.After moving to (0,8), I will collect the apple and grow. My new body will be [(0,9), (1,9)], which blocks the path to (1,9). From (0,8), I should consider moving RIGHT to (1,8) if snake #1 has moved away, or DOWN to (0,7) to explore lower rows for apples like (7,2) or (7,3). I need to monitor snake #1's position to avoid collisions, especially since it might be at (2,8) after eating the apple there. Prioritizing safety while seeking the nearest apples is key.\n\nDOWN",
