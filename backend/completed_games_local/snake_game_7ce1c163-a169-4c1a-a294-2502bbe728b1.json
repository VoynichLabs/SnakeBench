The nearby apples are at (6,0), (5,3), and (3,1), with (7,3) being relatively close to some, especially the apple at (6,0) if I can get there efficiently.\n\nFirst, I need to identify safe moves:\n\n- Moving UP (to (7,4)): This does not collide with my body or enemy, as my snake is only one segment long, and no body is blocking this. But moving UP doesn\u2019t immediately approach any apples. It does keep options open, but seems less urgent.\n\n- Moving DOWN (to (7,2)): This is safe; there's no obstacle. Moving down brings me closer to the apple at (6,0) over time if I plan carefully, but since that apple is at (6,0), moving down doesn't immediately decrease the distance to it. Moving down keeps the current pathway open.\n\n- Moving LEFT (to (6,3)): This would move me toward the apple at (5,3), which is directly to the left. Exciting opportunity to eat at that apple in the next move if I choose LEFT. Seems promising.\n\n- Moving RIGHT (to (8,3)): Moving right away would be toward the enemy snake's head at (8,0), but that is two steps away vertically. Moving right would not be safe if an enemy or obstacle exists; but in the current map, moving RIGHT to (8,3) is safe, as that cell is empty. But moving toward the enemy's head at (8,0), which is two steps below, seems less advantageous unless I intend to commit to that route.\n\nConsidering safety, all four moves seem safe since the snake is only length one and no immediate dangers. But the priority should be to pick a move that helps me collect the closest apple or avoid waiting too long in a potentially dangerous position.\n\nGiven the apple at (6,0) is very close, and the apple at (5,3) is to the left, I can move LEFT to pick the apple at (5,3) next move, which seems to be a good plan.\n\nSo, I will choose LEFT to move directly toward the apple at (5,3).\n\n**My decision: LEFT**",

Future options are limited (only up or left, since right is off-board) \u2192 low priority.\n- **UP (8, 1)**: Nearest apple is (3, 1) (5 x-units left) \u2013 farther than the closest apple. Open future options but less aligned with short-term growth \u2192 medium priority.\n- **LEFT (7, 0)**: Brings me one step closer to the nearest apple (6, 0) (only 1 more left move to reach it). Future options are open (up to 7,1, left to 6,0, right back to 8,0) \u2192 high priority.\n\nHead-on collision risk is zero for all safe moves: enemy snake 1 (7, 3) has no possible moves that would take it to my target cells (7,0, 9,0, 8,1) in this turn.\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Future Self Note)\n1. Short-term: Secure the nearby (6,0) apple next turn to grow first (improves survival odds against the enemy).\n2. After eating (6,0), assess enemy movement: if they target (5,3) or (0,3), pivot to the next closest apple (3,1) to maintain a point lead.\n3. Avoid unnecessary movement toward the enemy\u2019s initial position (7,3) to prevent early head-on collisions.\n4. Prioritize lower-y apples first (closer) before targeting the far (9,8) apple.\n\nLEFT",

The closest to us is at (0,3), but that is far away.\n- Enemy snake's head at (6,1) moving along (6,0), approaching upward.\n- To stay safe, I need to avoid colliding with walls or any snake bodies.\n- The current position is safe: moves in all directions are possible initially, but moving into walls or own body needs consideration.\n\nAssessing movement options:\n\n- **UP (to (4,4))**:\n  - Keeps close to current position, safe, open space ahead.\n  - Moving up gets us closer to Apple at (4,2)? No, that is below, so not directly beneficial for current goal (getting apples soon).\n  - Also, possibility of cutting off enemies or setting up next move.\n\n- **DOWN (to (4,2))**:\n  - Moving to (4,2) is safe.\n  - Not immediately advantageous, but positions us close to apples at (4,2) if they reappear.\n  - Dead-end in the immediate future, no apples directly accessible at (4,2), but the path is clear.\n\n- **LEFT (to (3,3))**:\n  - Moving left is safe, and it positions us closer to the apple at (3,1) in the longer term.\n  - Moving left would put us in a more open space and avoid enemy head directly.\n\n- **RIGHT (to (5,3))**:\n  - Moving right would put us onto the position of our current tail, which is safe because tail moves away.\n  - It would be risky if the tail didn't move, but since the tail is at (5,3) and moves away after the move, it's safe.\n  - It moves us further from the apple at (4,2), but potentially prepares us to approach it in subsequent moves.\n\nConsidering the immediate benefit:\n\n- Moving **LEFT** seems the best:  \n  - It moves us away from the enemy's likely approach (the enemy is at (6,1) moving upward).\n  - It opens potential paths and maintains safety.\n  - It positions us nearer to the apple at (3,1) for future consumption.\n\nOther options (UP or DOWN) are safe but less strategic given the current placement.\n\nI will choose **LEFT** to maximize open space and set up better future moves, while still remaining safe and close to other apples.\n\n**My move: LEFT**",

Still, safety is good.  \n- Moving **DOWN** to (2,2): safe as well, but closer to our body at (2,3) and away from the apple at (3,9). It could lead to a more enclosed situation since the space below is open, but risks moving nearer to enemy's position at (3,2) if enemy moves upward.  \n- Moving **LEFT** to (1,3): safe and closer to the apple at (0,3), which is directly to the left. This also keeps the right side open.  \n- Moving **RIGHT** to (3,3): occupied by our body, illegal.  \n\nGiven that, **Left** not only moves closer to the nearby apple and keeps options open, but also does not put us into immediate danger from the enemy or our own body.\n\nThe safest and most strategic move considering current positions is **LEFT**.\n\n**Decision: LEFT**",
