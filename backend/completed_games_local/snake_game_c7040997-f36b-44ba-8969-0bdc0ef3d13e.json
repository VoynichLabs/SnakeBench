No collisions with board edges or any snake.\n2. **DOWN** to (6, 5): Safe. No collisions.\n3. **LEFT** to (5, 6): **BLOCKED** - This is where my body currently is. Moving left would be moving directly backward into my own body = death.\n4. **RIGHT** to (7, 6): Safe. No collisions.\n\n**Viable Moves:** UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options remain)\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n\nThe closest apple is at (7, 7), which is 1 cell up and 1 cell right from my current position. My path needs to be efficient while keeping options open.\n\n- **UP** to (6, 7): Moves closer to the (7, 7) apple (distance reduces to \u221a2). This positions me well for an immediate right move next turn to collect that apple. Maintains good board flexibility.\n\n- **DOWN** to (6, 5): Moves away from all nearby apples. Poor strategic choice.\n\n- **RIGHT** to (7, 6): Also gets closer to (7, 7) apple (distance \u221a2). However, I need to check if this creates collision risks. Enemy head is at (7, 4) and will move. If enemy moves up to (7, 5), then on the next turn moving up to (7, 7) would require checking safety. Moving UP first gives me better control and clearer vision.\n\n**Preferred Path:** Moving UP first allows me to collect (7, 7) next turn with minimal risk, then continue to collect other apples like (9, 8).\n\n**Long-term strategy note for next turn:**\nAfter moving UP to (6, 7), expect to move RIGHT to (7, 7) on turn 9 to collect the apple there. This keeps me ahead in the apple race (currently 1-2 in apples). Monitor enemy position carefully; they're at (7, 4) and pose no immediate threat if moving up the right side of the board. Prioritize collecting (9, 8) next, then reassess for remaining apples.\n\nUP",

This is perfect because:\n- Moving LEFT to (2, 9) puts me just 1 cell away from the apple at (1, 9)\n- Next turn, I can move LEFT again to (1, 9) and grab that apple\n- This maintains my lead or extends it (currently tied at 3-3 apples)\n- After getting that apple, I'll have room to pursue other apples on the board\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1. Move LEFT this turn to (2, 9)\n2. Move LEFT next turn to (1, 9) to collect the apple\n3. After collecting, reassess the board and pursue the next nearest apple while maintaining safe distance from Snake #1\n4. The apples at (9, 6), (9, 8), and (7, 1) are reasonable secondary targets, but prioritize not dying first\n\nLEFT",

Moving UP into (3,9) is safe assuming Snake #0 either peels left toward (1,9) or drops down into the current head cell and kills itself, and it keeps my head ahead of the enemy while inching toward the contested apple. That move also keeps my tail flexible for future maneuvers and keeps the corridor open for a possible pivot if the enemy blocks the top-left apple.\n\nPlan: Keep pushing toward the (1,9) apple while maintaining enough separation from Snake #0 so it can\u2019t trap me; if it commits to the apple then bail toward the nearby (0,2) or (9,6) instead.\n\nUP",
