I would eat it and grow.\n   - Safe (no collision with own body or enemy).\n   - After eating, I'd be at (6, 5) with length 2.\n\n2. **UP to (5, 6)**:\n   - No apple there.\n   - Safe move.\n   - From there, I could go UP to (5, 7) or RIGHT to (6, 6).\n\n3. **LEFT to (4, 5)**:\n   - No apple there.\n   - Safe move.\n   - From there, I'd need to go RIGHT twice to reach the nearest apples.\n\n4. **DOWN to (5, 4)**:\n   - No apple there.\n   - Safe move.\n   - This moves away from most apples.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe RIGHT move to (6, 5) is optimal because:\n1.

I should prioritize the immediate apple at (6, 5) and grow my snake.\n\n**Plan for future:** After eating at (6, 5), I'll assess whether to go after (8, 5) next, or possibly head toward the cluster of apples at (8, 9) and (8, 3).
