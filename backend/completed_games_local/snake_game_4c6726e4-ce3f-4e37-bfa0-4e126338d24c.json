This moves away from the cluster of apples on row y=4 ((5, 4) and (8, 4)) and doesn't significantly improve access to other apples.\n- **DOWN**: Moves to (3, 3).

From (2,4) I can take (2,5) next turn or pivot as needed depending on enemy movement.\n- UP is also safe, but keeps me hugging x=1 for longer.\n- LEFT is least attractive because it restricts space.\n\nShort plan:\n- Move RIGHT now to approach the (2,5)/(3,5) apples.

From (2,5) I can go UP or RIGHT to approach the (3,8)/(3,9) apples while preserving multiple escape routes.

It keeps me alive, moves me to a more open area of the board, and preserves multiple future movement options. Moving left would trap me in the corner with limited mobility.\n\nStrategy note: After moving up to (1, 1), I should assess the board again and potentially head right/up to get closer to the center where I have more room to maneuver toward the apples on the right side of the board.\n\nUP",

Enemy head (1,0) and its body are far away, so no likely head-on collision this turn.\n- Moving UP toward (3,6) does not step on an apple now, so my tail will move forward and I won't accidentally collide with my own body next turn.\n\nChoice reasoning:\n- UP is the most direct move toward the nearby apples at (3,8) and (3,9). It keeps multiple follow-up options (LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN on the next turn except LEFT into the neck will be illegal after some moves), and it avoids getting funneled toward column 0 where my older body lies.\n- RIGHT (4,5) is safe but delays reaching the two apples directly above me. DOWN (3,4) moves away from those high-value apples and into less useful space.\n- The enemy is distant and constrained along the bottom/right corridor, so aggressive risk is unnecessary; collecting the apples above is the priority.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move UP to approach the (3,8)/(3,9) apples, then continue up to eat them while keeping escape options toward the center if enemy movements become threatening.\n\nUP",
