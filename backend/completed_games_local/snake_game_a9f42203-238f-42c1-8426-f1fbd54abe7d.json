We are starting at (0, 4) and that archrival of ours is chillin' at (4, 7). He thinks he's safe? HE THINKS HE'S GOT THE MACRO?! Not on my watch! \ud83d\ude24\n\nLet's break down the geometry, Chat! We need apples, we need length, and we need to make sure we don't get boxed in early! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**THE GOALS:**\n1. **APPLES:** We got a cluster at (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), and (1, 8). That\u2019s a literal gold mine right next to us! \ud83d\udcb0\n2. **THE ENEMY:** Snake #1 is at (4, 7). If I go UP, I'm heading straight toward that apple buffet. \n3. **SAFETY CHECK:** \n   - **LEFT:** ( -1, 4 ) - INSTANT DEATH! We're off the board! Throwing the game turn 1? We don't do that here! \ud83d\udeab\n   - **DOWN:** (0, 3) - Safe, but there's no fruit down there. We're playing for content, not for a nap! \ud83d\ude34\n   - **RIGHT:** (1, 4) - Safe, moves us toward center-ish, but doesn't immediately grab the line of apples.\n   - **UP:** (0, 5) - Safe! And it puts us one step away from the (1, 5) apple next turn. We stay on the edge, keeping our options open to loop around!\n\n**THE STRAT:**\nWe're going to climb the left wall! If we move UP to (0, 5), we can then pivot RIGHT to start snacking on that vertical line of apples at x=1. Our rival is at (4, 7), likely looking at the apples at (5, 8) or (6, 8). If we play it smart, we grow long on the left side and then cut him off when he tries to breathe! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udeab\n\nIs he ready for the aggression?! He's probably thinking I'll play it slow. NOPE. We're going for the speedrun! UP we go!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** \nClimb the x=0 or x=1 columns to secure the 1-5, 1-6, 1-7, and 1-8 apples. This builds our tail fast. Use that length to create a wall on the left side of the board and force the rival into the center or right where we can trap him against the edge! Let's get this dub! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! We're LIVE, Turn 0! Fresh start, 10x10 board, and my archrival, Snake #0, is lurking down in the bottom-left corner at (0, 4)! We're up high at (4, 7). This isn't just Snake, it's a battle for dominance! Who's ready for some calculated aggression?\n\nWe've got apples scattered everywhere! Look at that cluster in the top-right and the line through column 1! We need to scoop some serious content, but more importantly, we need to box in this villain!\n\nCurrent position: ID 1 is at (4, 7).\nSnake #0 is at (0, 4).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Safe Moves (ID 1)\n\nMy possible moves are UP (4, 8), DOWN (4, 6), LEFT (3, 7), RIGHT (5, 7). Since I'm length 1, hitting my own body backwards isn't a concern yet.\n\n1.  **UP (4, 8):** Safe. Moves towards apples at (5, 8) and (6, 8).\n2.  **DOWN (4, 6):** Safe. Leaves me exposed but keeps me central.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 7):** Safe. Moves closer to apples at (1, 7) and (1, 6).\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 7):** Safe. Moves closer to apples at (6, 8).\n\nAll four moves are safe *from self-collision and border collision*.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Opponent's Threat (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (0, 4).\nPossible moves for Snake #0: UP (0, 5), DOWN (0, 3 - wall), RIGHT (1, 4). LEFT is the wall, so they will die if they go LEFT.\nSafe moves for Snake #0: UP, RIGHT. DOWN is a border death!\n\nThe closest Snake #0 can get to me this turn is (0, 5) or (1, 4). There is zero chance of a head-to-head collision this turn.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Positioning and Apple Grabbing\n\nWe need to establish early control. The apples are concentrated in the top half and the left edge. I'm already well-positioned for the top.\n\n*   **Option UP (4, 8):** Puts me on A (5, 8) or A (6, 8) for the next turn. Great centralization for the top-right cluster.\n*   **Option LEFT (3, 7):** Puts me one move away from (1, 7) or (1, 6) cluster. A strong move to compete on the left side.\n\nLooking at the board, Snake #0 is likely going for the left side (up to (0, 5) then right, or directly right to (1, 4)). If they go to (1, 4), they are aiming for the central left area where the apples (1, 5), (2, 5) are, or the bottom (3, 0), (3, 1).\n\nI have a huge advantage up top. Let's push high and grab some altitude. This gives us space to maneuver and isolate the opponent later.\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 8):\nNext turn I can go RIGHT (5, 8) to instantly eat an apple (5, 8), or UP again (4, 9) or LEFT/DOWN. This is a very open, content-rich spot.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 7):\nNext turn I can go LEFT again to (2, 7) or DOWN to (3, 6). The apple at (1, 7) is two steps away. This is slightly slower for immediate content compared to the setup for (5, 8).\n\nLet's capitalize on the vertical advantage we have! We're starting at (4, 7), the high ground is ours! We move UP and secure the top lane. We can easily transition to (5, 8) next turn for the first apple of the game! First blood is huge, right, Chat?!\n\n### Future Plan (Long-Term Strategy Note)\n*T0-T2: Secure the top right apple cluster (starting with (5, 8)). Use the height advantage to force Snake #0 to chase us into open space or risk being bottlenecked near the bottom.*\n\nWe are moving UP! Securing the height! Let's GO!\n\nUP",

Our rival at (4, 8) is probably shaking in his scales right now! He thinks he can outplay us? NOT TODAY! \ud83d\udc85\n\n**THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS:**\nWe are on the far left edge. Our body is literally just our head right now (no length yet!), so we can't hit ourselves. But we *can* hit the wall! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n- **LEFT:** ( -1, 5 ) - CHAT, NO! We are not hitting the wall on turn 2! That's a one-way ticket to the \"fail compilation\" videos! \ud83d\udeab\n- **DOWN:** ( 0, 4 ) - Going back where we came from? BORING! No progress, no apples, no glory!\n- **UP:** ( 0, 6 ) - Keeps us on the wall. It's safe, but it's not getting us that delicious fruit juice!\n- **RIGHT:** ( 1, 5 ) - **BOOM!** There it is! The first apple of the game is sitting right there at (1, 5)! \ud83c\udf4e\u2728\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nWe are going RIGHT!

He's likely looking at (5, 8) or (6, 8). He's far enough away that we don't have to worry about a head-on collision at (1, 5). We are playing the long game, building our wall on the left side to eventually PIN HIM DOWN! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n**LONG-TERM STRAT:**\nGrab (1, 5), then pivot UP to vacuum up (1, 6), (1, 7), and (1, 8). By the time we hit the top-left corner, we'll have a massive tail to start snaking across the top of the board. We're building a cage, Chat!

Snake #0, our archrival, also moved UP, going from (0, 4) to (0, 5)! He's trying to contest the left side, but we're about to run the top half! He's just streaming in the minor leagues while we're on the main stage, right?\n\nCurrent position: ID 1 @ (4, 8)\nOpponent #0 @ (0, 5)\nApple target: (5, 8) is literally one step away! (6, 8) is two steps away! We are in apple paradise!\n\n### Strategic Objective for Turn 1\nWe need that first apple! Getting the first bit of content gives us a huge psychological and size advantage. We've set ourselves up perfectly for the apple at (5, 8).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Safe Moves (ID 1)\n\nMy possible moves are:\n1.  **UP (4, 9):** Safe. Moves towards apples at (9, 9) but leaves (5, 8) for someone else.\n2.  **DOWN (4, 7):** Safe. Retreats back to where we started. Why would we do that? Waste of altitude!\n3.  **LEFT (3, 8):** Safe. Moves toward (1, 8). This is an alternative apple grab path.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 8):** **Apple at (5, 8)!** This is the move! Instant content win!\n\nAll four moves are safe\u2014no self-collision, no border collision (yet).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Opponent's Threat (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (0, 5).\nPossible moves for Snake #0: UP (0, 6) or RIGHT (1, 5). DOWN is a safe retreat to (0, 4). LEFT is a border death.\n\n*   If Snake #0 goes UP to (0, 6), they are aiming for the (1, 6) apple.\n*   If Snake #0 goes RIGHT to (1, 5), they are aiming for the (1, 5) apple instantly!\n\nIf Snake #0 takes (1, 5), they get their first apple. We cannot stop that from (4, 8).\n\nIs there any chance of collision if we go RIGHT to (5, 8)?\nSnake #0 is 5 steps away (0, 5) -> (1, 5) -> (2, 5) -> (3, 5) -> (4, 5) -> (5, 5). No risk of collision this turn, even if he maximizes distance towards us. He's way too slow!\n\n### Step 3: Prioritize Content!\n\nThe move is clear, Chat! We execute the plan: get to (5, 8) and grab that sweet, sweet content! First apple of the game is ours! This also pushes us further right, perfectly setting us up for (6, 8) and (9, 8)/(9, 9) in the subsequent turns. We are dominating the high-value real estate!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (T1-T3)\nWe are going right to eat (5, 8). Our body will now be at (4, 8). Next, we aim for (6, 8). Once we have (5, 8) and potentially (6, 8), we pivot. If Snake #0 remains small and centralized on the left, we use our length advantage to cut off his access to the middle/top of the board. The priority remains apples and controlling space.\n\nWe are going RIGHT for the apple! LET'S GOOOOO!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! That was a massive Turn 1! We got the apple at (5, 8) and secured the early lead! We grew to length 2, and now our body is [(4, 8)]! Snake #0 also snagged an apple, moving from (0, 5) to (1, 5) and getting the apple at (1, 5)! He's matching us on apples, but we control the high ground, y'all! Time to press the advantage!\n\nCurrent position: ID 1 @ (5, 8). We are fat and happy!\nOpponent #0 @ (1, 5). He's currently moving right and low.\n\n### Strategic Objective for Turn 2\nWe need to keep eating and consolidating power in the top-right corner. The next content grab is looking like (6, 8) or (9, 8)! We aim to maximize our length quickly to start building walls and restricting Snake #0's movement.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Safe Moves (ID 1)\n\nMy current head is at (5, 8). My body is at (4, 8).\n\n1.  **UP (5, 9):** Safe. No apple. Moves toward the boundary and away from the nearest apple (6, 8).\n2.  **DOWN (5, 7):** Safe. No apple. Retreats. Unnecessary.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 8):** **DEATH!** Moving into our own body segment! ABSOLUTELY NOT. That's a self-clip!\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 8):** **APPLE at (6, 8)!** This is the move! Two apples in two turns! We are going for the streak!\n\nOnly three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. **RIGHT** is the clear winner because it secures another apple!\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Opponent's Threat (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 5), body at (0, 5).\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0:\n*   **UP (1, 6):** **Apple!** This is very likely his move. He grabs (1, 6) and starts moving into the vertical lane.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 5):** Apple is at (2, 5). Also very likely! He secures the horizontal lane.\n*   **DOWN (1, 4):** Safe, but retreats from apples.\n*   **LEFT (0, 5):** **DEATH!** Moving into their own body segment!\n\nWe assume Snake #0 is smart (even though he's our rival, he's not *that* bad) and will go for an apple at (1, 6) or (2, 5).\n\nCan Snake #0 reach (6, 8)? No. He is 5 steps away, and even if he moves 5 steps up and right immediately, he won't be close enough to even threaten us. We have virtually no threat of collision on the top half of the board during this move.\n\n### Step 3: Prioritize Content and Position!\n\nMove is unequivocally RIGHT to (6, 8) for the apple! This gives us fantastic positioning. We will be length 3, with our body at [(5, 8), (4, 8)]. We can then aim for the massive cluster of apples on the top edge: (9, 8) and (9, 9).\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (T3-T5)\nWe continue to vacuum up the top edge of the board. After eating at (6, 8), our next targets are probably (9, 8) and (9, 9). This will stretch us across the top, denying that space to Snake #0 and giving us a massive length advantage. Meanwhile, Snake #0 is likely going for the column of apples around x=1, currently aiming at (1, 6) or (2, 5). Our goal is to grow quickly, then use our length to force him into the corner (0,0) or isolate him below y=4. We need to be wary of the apple at (2, 5) which is also valuable, but (6, 8) is secured by us and offers a better path to the high-value cluster.\n\nWe are going for the apple! Let's get this dub, Chat!\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #1 is fumbling around in the top right while we are out here playing efficient, tactical, high-IQ Snake. \ud83e\udde0\n\n**THE VIBE CHECK:**\nWe just hit (1, 6) and grew to size 3. My body is trailing behind at (1, 5) and (0, 5). We are looking lean, mean, and hungry for more! Check the map\u2014there's an apple at (1, 7) and another at (1, 8). It\u2019s like a trail of breadcrumbs for the GOAT! \ud83d\udc10\n\n**THE TACTICAL BREAKDOWN:**\n- **LEFT:** (0, 6) - It's safe, but it's a dead zone. No apples, no progress. We don't do \"safe but boring\" here! \ud83d\ude34\n- **DOWN:** (1, 5) - CHAT, THAT'S MY OWN BODY! You want me to eat myself for the memes? Absolutely not.

We are now LITERALLY stretching across the high ground! Our body is THICK: [(5, 8), (4, 8)]!\n\nBut wait, what did Snake #0 do? He clearly picked UP and ate the apple at (1, 6)! He's matching us on apples: 2-2! He's gaining length and moving up that left vertical column! He's still down low, but he's mobile!\n\nCurrent Position:\nID 1 (Us): (6, 8). Body: [(5, 8), (4, 8)].\nSnake #0: (1, 6). Body: [(1, 5), (0, 5)].\n\nThe board is open, but we need to start boxing him in! Our plan to dominate the top edge is working!\n\n### Strategic Objective for Turn 3\nContinue securing the top boundary and creating a formidable wall. Our goal is to stretch towards the corner apples (9, 8) and (9, 9) and then pressure Snake #0, who is now moving into the center left.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Safe Moves (ID 1)\n\nMy head is at (6, 8). Body trail is (5, 8).\n\n1.  **UP (6, 9):** Safe. No apple. Moves towards the boundary but sets us up perfectly for (9, 9).\n2.  **DOWN (6, 7):** Safe. No apple. Retreats from the objective.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 8):** **DEATH!** Moving into our own body! *Clip alert!* Hard pass, Chat!\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 8):** Safe. No apple *here*, but this is our main access point to the huge apple cluster at (9, 8) and (9, 9)! This is a strong positional move.\n\nWe have a choice between UP to (6, 9) (border run) or RIGHT to (7, 8) (access point). Both are excellent positional moves.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Opponent's Threat (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 6). Body is (1, 5). He has several attractive options:\n*   **UP (1, 7):** **Apple at (1, 7)!** This is highly likely! He continues up the vertical column, maybe aiming for (1, 8).\n*   **RIGHT (2, 6):** Safe. Moves him toward the center.\n*   **DOWN (1, 5):** **DEATH!** Into his own body! Not a play.\n*   **LEFT (0, 6):** Safe. Moves him toward the boundary.\n\nIf Snake #0 goes UP to (1, 7), he's still locked on the left side. He poses absolutely no threat to us on the right side of the board (x > 6) right now. A head-on collision is impossible this turn.\n\n### Step 3: Prioritize Position! What is the best sequence?\n\nWhere is the next most valuable content for us?\n1. Apple at (9, 8) and (9, 9).\n2. Apple at (7, 5).\n\nIf we go UP to (6, 9):\nNext move options: LEFT (5, 9), RIGHT (7, 9).\n*   Movement sequence: (6, 8) -> (6, 9) -> (7, 9) -> (8, 9) -> RIGHT to (9, 9). This is 3 moves to the first major apple.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (7, 8):\nNext move options: UP (7, 9 - no apple), RIGHT (8, 8 - no apple), DOWN (7, 7).\n*   Movement sequence: (6, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (8, 8) -> UP/RIGHT -> (9, 8) or (8, 9). This is also about 3 or 4 moves minimum to the target (9, 8).\n\nThe (9, 8) and (9, 9) apples are absolutely critical for securing the top boundary. If we go RIGHT to (7, 8), we are directly on the path to (9, 8).\n\nLet's look at the density of apples. The entire top right corner is content heaven.\n(9, 9) is the furthest out. (9, 8) is right next to it.\n(7, 8) looks like the most direct path to start grabbing the right side perimeter because it keeps us away from the top boundary for one more turn, allowing us to pivot easily between (9, 8) and (9, 9).\n\nIf we go UP to (6, 9), we are locked to the top edge sooner, which is fine, but it might make turning around later a little tighter if we want to come down the right wall.\n\nLet's take the most aggressive path towards the corner cluster. RIGHT to (7, 8) will put us on the x-axis that holds (9, 8).\n\n### Final Decision Analysis: RIGHT to (7, 8)\nThis move:\n1. Keeps us 100% safe.\n2. Moves us aggressively toward the most valuable content chunk on the board (the top-right border).\n3. Maintains excellent space separation from Snake #0.\n4. Extends our body further horizontally, making us a bigger obstacle very early.\n\nThis is a power play, Chat! We claim the border!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (T4-T6)\nContinue moving RIGHT along y=8 to secure (9, 8). Once we hit (9, 8), we will turn UP for (9, 9). This guarantees us four apples in the first few turns and makes us a massive horizontal wall, forcing Snake #0 to deal with the bottom two-thirds of the board, heavily constrained. We need to be aware of the center apples on y=5 and y=4 soon, and ensure we don't allow Snake #0 to grow too long and cut across the middle.\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #1 is trying to act tough, but look at him\u2014he's wandering around (7, 8) like he's lost in the sauce! Meanwhile, we just gobbled up that apple at (1, 7) and we are looking like a total snack (but not for him)!\n\n**THE VITALS:**\n- **Head:** (1, 7)\n- **Body:** [(1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5)]\n- **Apples:** 3 (Gimme that gold!)\n\n**THE TACTICAL BREAKDOWN:**\n- **DOWN:** (1, 6). THAT'S OUR OWN TAIL, CHAT! We aren't doing the Ouroboros challenge today. NOPE. \ud83d\udeab\n- **LEFT:** (0, 7). Safe? Yes. Progressive? No. Why move to the edge when we have a buffet waiting for us? \ud83d\ude34\n- **RIGHT:** (2, 7). It\u2019s an option if we wanted to head to the center, but why give up our momentum on the left flank?\n- **UP:** (1, 8). **LET\u2019S GOOO!** Look at the map! There is an apple sitting right there at (1, 8). It\u2019s practically screaming our name! If we take this, we hit 4 apples and keep our lead. \ud83c\udf4e\u2728\n\n**THE RIVAL WATCH:**\nSnake #1 is at (7, 8). If he goes UP to (7, 9) or RIGHT to (8, 8), he's staying away from us. If he tries to come LEFT toward the center, he's still miles away. We are living rent-free in his head while we feast on the left side of the board!\n\n**THE LONG-TERM PLAY:**\nWe take the apple at (1, 8) this turn. Then, we look at the board\u2014the apple at (0, 0) is far, but there are clusters at (3, 0), (3, 1), and (3, 2). After we grab (1, 8), we can potentially loop around or cut across to keep the pressure high. Snake #1 is playing checkers, we are playing 4D Snake! \ud83e\udde0\n\nDon't blink, Chat, because we are about to be 4-2! Stay hungry, stay dangerous! \ud83e\udd4a\n\nUP",

We gotta step up the content creation, fam!\n\nLast turn, we executed the Power Play, moving **RIGHT** to (7, 8). That was fire! Look at our body now: [(6, 8), (5, 8)]! We are H-U-G-E across the top border! Snake #0, as predicted, went UP and snagged the apple at (1, 7)! He's now at (1, 7) with a body of [(1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5)]. He's trying to make a vertical wall on the left!\n\n### The Game State: Critical Analysis\n\nWe are at (7, 8). We are perfectly positioned to seize the top-right corner. Snake #0 is at (1, 7).\n\n**Board State Review:**\n- We are threatening the (9, 8) and (9, 9) apples.\n- Snake #0 is threatening the (1, 8) apple and the (2, 5) apple.\n- The center-right is opening up, especially around (7, 5).\n\nOur immediate priority is to catch up on apples and extend our wall!\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Safe Moves (ID 1)\n\nMy head is at (7, 8). Body trail is (6, 8).\n\n1.  **UP (7, 9):** Safe. No apple. Puts us on the boundary, great for pivoting to (9, 9).\n2.  **DOWN (7, 7):** Safe. No apple. Retreats from the border goal.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 8):** **DEATH!** Moving into our own body (the block right behind us)! NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 8):** Safe. No apple *yet*, but this is the straight shot towards the (9, 8) apple! This is the most aggressive move towards content!\n\nWe have two great positional moves: UP to (7, 9) or RIGHT to (8, 8). Which one gets us to the next apple fastest?\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Opponent's Threat (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 7). Body is (1, 6).\n\nWhat is Snake #0 likely to do?\n*   **UP (1, 8):** **Apple at (1, 8)!** This is highly probable. He gets a fourth apple and continues his vertical wall, making the left side dense.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 7):** Safe. Moves him toward the center. Less likely since there's an apple UP.\n*   **LEFT (0, 7):** Safe. Keeps him on the edge.\n*   **DOWN (1, 6):** **DEATH!** Into his own body!\n\nIf he goes UP to (1, 8), his body will be [(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5)]. He is still completely isolated on the far left. Head collision is impossible.\n\n### Step 3: Prioritize Content and Positioning!\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (8, 8):\n*   Next turn (T5): We can move RIGHT again to (9, 8) and grab that sweet apple!\n*   (7, 8) -> (8, 8) -> (9, 8) (Apple!) -> (9, 9) (Apple!) This is absolutely the fastest route to two immediate apples.\n\nIf we go UP to (7, 9):\n*   Next turn (T5): We can move RIGHT to (8, 9) (no apple). Then T6 to (9, 9) (Apple!). This path is slower to the first apple.\n\nThe path RIGHT to **(8, 8)** is objectively superior for content acquisition because it lines us up for the immediate apple at (9, 8) on the very next turn. This ensures we quickly claim the top-right corner as our territory and make that horizontal wall even stronger!\n\n### Future Strategy Note (T5-T7)\n\nWe must go RIGHT to (8, 8) this turn. Next turn, we hit the apple at (9, 8). After that, we claim the high ground at (9, 9). Once we own the top boundary, we start looking for a way to pressure Snake #0. Maybe we'll drop down the right side (y=9, y=8 secured) and start claiming the (9, 4), (7, 5), and (7, 1) apples, squeezing him into the bottom-left quadrant. We have space, we have momentum. We need to focus on content and length!\n\nRIGHT",

That\u2019s what DOMINANCE looks like!\n\n**THE VITALS:**\n- **Head:** (1, 8)\n- **Body:** [(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5)]\n- **Apples:** 4 (We're feasting tonight!)\n\n**THE TACTICAL BREAKDOWN:**\n- **DOWN:** (1, 7). That\u2019s our own neck, Chat! We aren't trying to do a 180 and end the stream early! **HARD PASS.** \ud83d\udeab\n- **LEFT:** (0, 8). Safely hugging the wall, but it\u2019s a bit claustrophobic. Why go into the corner when we have the whole board to dominate?\n- **UP:** (1, 9). This puts us on the very top edge. Not bad, but it limits our movement options for the next turn. We want to stay flexible! \ud83e\udd38\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n- **RIGHT:** (2, 8). **OH YEAH!** This is the high-IQ play! It moves us toward the center-right where the REAL action is. Look at those apples at (3, 5), (7, 5), and the spicy ones popping up at (9, 8) and (9, 9)!\n\n**THE RIVAL WATCH:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (8, 8). He's way over on the right. If we go RIGHT, we are effectively starting a pincer move. He thinks he's safe in his little corner? Think again! Moving to (2, 8) keeps us central and ready to react to wherever he tries to slither. He's playing for 2nd place while we're playing for the CROWN! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**THE LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe take (2, 8) now. Next, we are looking to dip down toward that apple cluster in the middle-bottom (3, 5), (2, 5). We're going to grow so big that Snake #1 won't have any floor space left to breathe! We\u2019re building a wall, and he\u2019s going to pay for it with his life! Let's get that 5th apple and keep the momentum rolling! \ud83d\udcc8\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #0 is cracked and has 4 apples, we're stuck at 2! This is unacceptable! We gotta close this gap!\n\nSnake #0, as predicted last turn, snagged the apple at (1, 8)! He is now at (1, 8) with a body of [(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5)]. He's building a massive vertical wall on the left side. He's trying to separate the board!\n\n### The Game State: Critical Analysis\n\nWe are at (8, 8). We are sitting right next to the (9, 8) apple! This is a guaranteed grab! Our body is [(7, 8), (6, 8)]. We are stretching across the top!\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Safe Moves (ID 1)\n\nMy head is at (8, 8). Body trail is (7, 8).\n\n1.  **UP (8, 9):** Safe. No apple. Puts us in the top corner. Good strategic move for the (9, 9) apple next.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 7):** Safe. No apple. Retreats from the objective.\n3.  **LEFT (7, 8):** **DEATH!** Into our own body! NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 8):** **APPLE!** (9, 8) is an apple! This is the content we need! Safe and high-value!\n\nOnly one choice gives us immediate content and gets us back in the apple race: **RIGHT!**\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Opponent's Threat (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 8). Body is (1, 7). He just grew to five segments! He's massive!\n\nWhat is Snake #0 likely to do?\n*   **UP (1, 9):** Safe. Keeps him on the edge. High probability, unless he spots the apples in the middle.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 8):** Safe. No apple. Moves him toward the highly contested center top.\n*   **LEFT (0, 8):** Safe. Keeps him on the boundary.\n*   **DOWN (1, 7):** **DEATH!** Into his own body!\n\nIf Snake #0 goes **UP to (1, 9)**, he secures the top-left boundary and continues to build his wall. His new body will be [(1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5)]. We are completely safe from collision this turn.\n\nIf Snake #0 goes **RIGHT to (2, 8)**, he approaches our territory, but we will already be at (9, 8). We still have zero collision risk.\n\n### Step 3: Prioritize Content and Positioning!\n\nWe MUST take the apple. If we don't, we fall further behind, and Snake #0 might potentially swing around the top and try to take it later, but that seems extremely slow for him. Our move is straightforward: **RIGHT to (9, 8) and get that 3rd apple!**\n\n**Wait! Head Collision Check!**\n\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (2, 8), and we move RIGHT to (9, 8), are we safe? Yes, 7 units apart.\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (1, 9), and we move RIGHT to (9, 8), are we safe? Yes.\n\nWe execute the plan for maximum content!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (T5-T7)\n\nWe execute **RIGHT** to (9, 8) this turn (T5, Apple +1). Our head is now in a perfect position to grab the final top-right corner apple at (9, 9) next turn (T6, Apple +1). This guarantees us two apples very quickly, catching us up to Snake #0, who will have 4 or 5 apples depending on what he does this turn (he has no immediate apples near him unless he travels far).\n\nAfter we secure the (9, 9) apple, we will own the entire top boundary. We must then calculate the best way to drop DOWN the right wall. The next accessible apples are at (9, 4), (8, 2) or cutting inward towards (7, 5). We will have to prioritize setting up a blockade to prevent Snake #0 from ever reaching the right half of the board! We are sealing the top half! Box him in early!\n\n### Final Decision\n\nPure content, pure positioning.\n\nRIGHT",

We've got 4 apples, he's only got 3, and we are looking like the absolute KINGS of this 10x10 jungle! Did you see that last move? (2, 8) puts us right where we need to be!\n\n**THE BOARD BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP:** (2, 9). Just hugging the top wall. Why limit our ceiling? We want to stay in the open where we can pivot and punish!\n- **LEFT:** (1, 8). **ABORT!** That's our own body! We aren't here to beat ourselves, we're here to beat the competition! \ud83d\uded1\n- **RIGHT:** (3, 8). This keeps us parallel to the top wall. It's okay, but check out the prize pool below us!\n- **DOWN:** (2, 7). **BINGO!** Look at the map, Chat! There is a juicy apple at (2, 5) and (3, 5). Moving DOWN sets us up for a straight shot at those nutrients!\n\n**THE TACTICAL PINCER:**\nOur rival, Snake #1, is hanging out at (9, 8). He's way on the other side of the map, likely trying to grab that (9, 9) apple. Let him! While he's stuck in the corner eating one apple, we're diving into the heart of the board to gobble up the cluster at (3, 5), (2, 5), and (3, 6)! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4f\n\nBy moving **DOWN** to (2, 7), we're keeping our body flexible. We aren't getting trapped against the north wall. We're staying mobile, staying hungry, and staying LETHAL! Snake #1 thinks he's safe? We're growing our length now so that when we meet in the middle, he's got NO WHERE TO RUN! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**THE FUTURE PLAY:**\nGet to (2, 5) ASAP. Secure the center. If Snake #1 tries to come across the middle, we'll have the length to cut him off and force the crash! Keep that lead, keep the pressure, and keep the CONTENNNTTT coming! \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udc51\n\nDOWN",

That was the easiest content grab of the night! We are now at (9, 8), stretched across the top, and staring right at the (9, 9) apple!\n\nSnake #0 is catching strays though! He's at (2, 8) and has 4 apples. He's building a huge wall on the left side, which is perfect for us, because we are about to seal off the top-right corner!\n\n### Current Board State Review\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 8)\n*   Body: [(8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8)] (Length 4)\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (2, 8)\n*   Body: [(1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5)] (Length 5)\n\n**Apples Near Me:** (9, 9) is right there! (9, 4) is a potential target after that.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Safe Moves (ID 1)\n\nMy head is at (9, 8). Body trail is (8, 8).\n\n1.  **UP (9, 9):** Safe! APPLE! This is a 100% must-take move! Box secured!\n2.  **DOWN (9, 7):** Safe. No apple. Retreats. Why would we retreat from glory?\n3.  **LEFT (8, 8):** **DEATH!** Into my own body! NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 8):** **DEATH!** Off the board! NOPE!\n\nWe only have one direction that provides immediate content and keeps us alive: **UP!**\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Opponent's Threat (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 8). Body is (1, 8). He is long and imposing.\n\nWhat is Snake #0 likely to do?\n*   He is staring right at the vast empty space in the middle. He might be tempted to go RIGHT or DOWN.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 8):** Safe. Moves him into the middle, away from his wall.\n*   **UP (2, 9):** Safe. Gets him close to the (9, 9) corner (but we get there first). Could connect him to the center top.\n*   **DOWN (2, 7):** Safe. Moves him toward the center.\n*   **LEFT (1, 8):** **DEATH!** Into his own body! NOPE!\n\nIs there any head-on collision risk?\nWe are moving to (9, 9). Snake #0's closest possible moves are (2, 9) or (3, 8). We are completely safe. There is literally zero risk of collision. This is a clean steal, Chat!\n\n### Step 3: Prioritize Content and Strategy!\n\nWe take the guaranteed apple at (9, 9). This puts us tied with Snake #0 at 4 apples each, and gives us ultimate board control of the top edge.\n\nOur new strategic focus for the next few turns is sealing that right side!\n1.  **T6 (Current Turn):** Move **UP** to (9, 9). Apple +1.\n2.  **T7:** From (9, 9), we dive **DOWN** to (9, 8). (This is a necessary retreat, setting up the right wall.)\n3.  **T8:** From (9, 8), we eye the (9, 4) apple, but we might move **DOWN** to (9, 7) or (9, 6) first to put pressure on the right wall and make that half of the board OURS!\n\nThis move (UP) is pure dominance!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (T7-T9)\n\nWe will execute UP to (9, 9) this turn (T6, Apple +1). Next turn (T7), we must move DOWN to (9, 8) to secure our position on the right wall. We will then continue DOWN the right edge (T8, T9) towards the (9, 4) apple. This strategy seals the top and right sides of the board, forcing Snake #0 into a small area on the left and middle. Our goal is to block access to the rich apple deposits on the bottom and right, and constrict his movement while we grow massive! Let's box this guy in!\n\nUP",

We are smooth with it!\n\n**THE BOARD BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP:** (2, 8). **ABORT!** That's our own neck! We aren't trying to fold ourselves like a lawn chair in front of the fans! \ud83d\uded1\n- **LEFT:** (1, 7). **ABORT!** Also our own body! Chat, we have to stay focused\u2014don't hit yourself, that's amateur hour!\n- **RIGHT:** (3, 7). This is an okay move, but it leads into the \"empty\" zone. Why go there when the buffet is open downstairs?\n- **DOWN:** (2, 6). **LETHAL!** Look at the vision! Moving to (2, 6) puts us one step away from a massive apple cluster at (3, 6), (3, 5), and (2, 5).

We are huge! L for the opponent for letting us run free like that!\n\n### Current Board State Review (Turn 7)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 9)\n*   Body: [(9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8)] (Length 5)\n*   Apples Collected: 4\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (2, 7)\n*   Body: [(2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6)] (Length 5). *Wait, his body is (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6). No, looking at the board: (2, 8) is body, (1, 8) is body, (1, 7) is body, (1, 6) is body. The *T*s are marked correctly!*\n*   Apples Collected: 4\n\n**Apples Near Me:** The next high-value apple on our side is (9, 4) or maybe (7, 5). We need to secure this right wall, Chat!\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Safe Moves (ID 1)\n\nMy head is at (9, 9). My body trail is at (9, 8).\n\n1.  **UP (9, 10):** **DEATH!** Off the board! NOPE!\n2.  **DOWN (9, 8):** Safe! This is the cell currently occupied by the first segment of my body. It will become safe because my tail moves off (6, 8) and my body moves off (9, 8) *simultaneously* with the head's movement. This moves us right down the wall! Strategy confirmed!\n3.  **LEFT (8, 9):** Safe! Moves us into the middle. A good option if we needed to pivot, but we are committed to the wall.\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 9):** **DEATH!** Off the board! NOPE!\n\nThe safest and most strategically sound move is **DOWN**. It continues our right-side wall construction toward the next apple target (9, 4).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Opponent's Threat (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 7). He built a nice wall on the left side, which is perfect for boxing him in.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 (Head at (2, 7), adjacent body at (2, 8)):\n*   **UP (2, 8):** Safe! Moves into his current body segment, but that segment releases simultaneously (since he didn't eat an apple last turn and isn't growing). This moves him toward the corner we just vacated.\n*   **DOWN (2, 6):** Safe! Moves him toward the center bottom, potentially aiming for the (3, 1) or (3, 0) apples.\n*   **LEFT (1, 7):** **DEATH!** He hits the next segment of his body (1, 7) which is *two* steps away from his head. That cell (1, 7) will NOT be empty this turn. NOPE!\n*   **RIGHT (3, 7):** Safe! Moves him into the central clearing, connecting to the vertical line of apples on X=3.\n\n**Collision Check:** We are moving to (9, 8). He is moving somewhere around (2, X) or (3, 7). Zero collision risk. We are good, Chat!\n\n### Step 3: Prioritize Content and Strategy!\n\nThe plan is simple: dominate the right side! Moving **DOWN** to (9, 8) seals the top part of the wall and sets us up beautifully for the next moves.\n\n**The Box-In Strategy is LIVE:**\n1.  **T7 (Current Turn):** Move **DOWN** to (9, 8).\n2.  **T8:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 7).\n3.  **T9:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 6).\n4.  **T10:** Grab the apple at (9, 4) potentially after one more setup move (9, 5).\n\nThis forces Snake #0 to deal with a rapidly constricting board and allows us to get massive first. We are putting in the work, chat! This is how you secure the bag!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (T8-T10)\n\nContinue the downward movement along the right wall (X=9) to secure access to the (9, 4) apple and establish maximum control over the right half of the board. This strategy aims to constrict Snake #0's available movement space to the central-left area. We become the Great Wall of Content!\n\nDOWN",
