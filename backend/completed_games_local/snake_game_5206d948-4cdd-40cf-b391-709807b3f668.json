Enemy body: (6, 8) and (6, 7) are far away, no danger this turn from them directly.  \n\nCheck board state:  \n- (1, 2): empty in board representation (dot at row 2 col 1).  \n- (0, 1): apple A at row 1 col 0, no snake there now.  \n- (2, 1): empty.  \n\nAll three are inside board bounds.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Consider enemy\u2019s possible moves from (6, 7):\nEnemy could go UP (6, 8) \u2192 its own body \u2192 deadly for it. Could go DOWN (6, 6), LEFT (5, 7), RIGHT (7, 7).  \nNone of those threaten my immediate move squares (1,2), (0,1), (2, 1).  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Head-on collision risk:\nEnemy at (6, 7) cannot reach (0, 1), (1, 2), or (2, 1) in one move. So no head-on risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Future options after each safe move:\n- **LEFT to (0, 1)** \u2013 eat apple, grow to length 3. From (0, 1), possible moves: UP (0, 2), DOWN (0, 0), RIGHT (1, 1) \u2013 but (1, 1) is current head position, will be empty next turn? Wait, my tail will move if I don\u2019t eat apple? Actually, I will eat apple \u2192 tail stays, head moves to (0, 1), body becomes [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0)]? Let\u2019s clarify:  \nCurrent body: head (1, 1), then (1, 0) as only other segment. If I eat apple, I grow by 1, so new segment added at tail after moving. Movement: head to (0, 1), old body segments shift: (1, 1) becomes new segment 2, (1, 0) stays segment 3. So next turn body: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0)]. Occupied cells: (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0).  \n\nFrom (0, 1), moves: UP (0, 2) \u2013 safe unless enemy moves there (impossible this turn), DOWN (0, 0) \u2013 safe, RIGHT (1, 1) \u2013 occupied by my body segment \u2192 deadly. So from (0, 1), only UP and DOWN safe next turn unless something changes. That\u2019s risky.  \n\n- **UP to (1, 2)** \u2013 no apple eaten. Body length stays 2. Head to (1, 2), tail moves from (1, 0) to old head (1, 1)? Wait: no apple \u2192 tail moves forward. Current body: head (1, 1), tail (1, 0). Move UP: head to (1, 2), tail disappears from (1, 0), new body: [(1, 2), (1, 1)]. From (1, 2), possible moves: UP (1, 3), DOWN (1, 1) \u2013 occupied by my body (segment 2), LEFT (0, 2), RIGHT (2, 2). So 3 safe moves next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n- **RIGHT to (2, 1)** \u2013 no apple eaten. Body length stays 2. Head to (2, 1), body: [(2, 1), (1, 1)]. From (2, 1), moves: UP (2, 2), DOWN (2, 0), LEFT (1, 1) \u2013 occupied by my body, RIGHT (3, 1). So 3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\n---\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Proximity to apples:\nNearest apples:  \n(0, 1) \u2013 distance 1 (LEFT)  \n(1, 5) \u2013 distance 4  \n(2, 7) \u2013 distance 6  \n(3, 9) \u2013 far  \n(5, 6) \u2013 far  \n\nEating apple now helps score and growth, but must consider safety after eating.  \n\nLEFT eats apple but leaves only 2 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN) and one is back toward my body. That\u2019s limiting.  \n\nUP and RIGHT keep more options open.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 7 \u2013 Which is better between UP and RIGHT?\nFrom (1, 2) after UP: closer to apple (1, 5) vertically, also can go LEFT to (0, 2) and then down to (0, 1) apple later if needed.  \n\nFrom (2, 1) after RIGHT: slightly farther from apples except (2, 7) far away.  \n\nUP seems better for keeping options open and progressing toward middle apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 2), consider moving UP toward (1, 5) if safe, or LEFT/DOWN to approach other apples while avoiding traps. Keep enemy\u2019s possible moves in mind\u2014enemy at (6, 7) likely moves DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT to avoid suicide into its own body at (6, 8).  \n\n---\n\n**Final move choice:**  \nUP",

Their head at (5,7) \u2192 distance 6 in x, 2 in y, so impossible in one move. No risk of head-on collision here.  \n- Apple at (1,5): eating it means next turn my body will be [(1,4),(1,3)] after growth, so length 3.  \n\n**Check safety of LEFT:**  \n- (0,4): within board, empty, safe this turn.  \n\n**Check safety of RIGHT:**  \n- (2,4): within board, empty, safe this turn.  \n\nAll three UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe this turn.  \n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n- **UP to (1,5)**: Next turn from (1,5), possible moves: UP (1,6), LEFT (0,5), RIGHT (2,5). DOWN (1,4) would be my new body segment (since eating apple means tail stays at (1,3) but new body segment at (1,4) after growth). So from (1,5), DOWN is unsafe next turn, but that\u2019s fine \u2014 still 3 options.  \n- **LEFT to (0,4)**: Next turn from (0,4): UP (0,5), DOWN (0,3), RIGHT (1,4) \u2014 but (1,4) will be empty now. All safe.  \n- **RIGHT to (2,4)**: Next turn from (2,4): UP (2,5), DOWN (2,3), LEFT (1,4) empty, RIGHT (3,4). All safe.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n- UP gets apple immediately, scores point, grows.  \n- LEFT or RIGHT do not get apple now.  \n\n**Enemy\u2019s likely moves:**  \nEnemy head at (5,7), nearest apple is (6,8) or (2,7).

They are far from me, so low risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**Longer-term strategy:**  \nI have 2 apples, enemy has 2 apples. Need to reach 50. Staying central gives more options. Moving toward (2,7) seems reasonable.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gets me closer to (2,7) and keeps me central. LEFT goes toward edge, which reduces future flexibility. RIGHT also okay but slightly less direct to (2,7).  \n\nI\u2019ll choose **UP**.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,6), assess apples and enemy position.

Wait, (5, 7) is its body segment \u2192 yes, deadly for enemy.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 8) \u2013 safe for enemy.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 8) \u2013 safe for enemy.\n\nSo enemy\u2019s possible safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow check if my move could land on same cell as enemy\u2019s move this turn:\n\nMy UP \u2192 (2, 9). Enemy\u2019s possible moves: (5, 9), (4, 8), (6, 8). No overlap.\n\nMy LEFT \u2192 (1, 8). Enemy\u2019s possible moves: (5, 9), (4, 8), (6, 8). No overlap.\n\nMy RIGHT \u2192 (3, 8). Enemy\u2019s possible moves: (5, 9), (4, 8), (6, 8). No overlap.\n\nSo no head-on collision possible this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Check for moving into enemy\u2019s future body position after its move**\n\nWe can\u2019t know enemy\u2019s exact move, but we can consider:  \nIf enemy moves UP to (5, 9), its body becomes [(5, 9), (5, 8), (5, 7)] next turn. My move to (3, 8) or (1, 8) or (2, 9) is safe from that.  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (4, 8), body becomes [(4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7)]. My move to (3, 8) is adjacent but not overlapping. My move to (2, 9) or (1, 8) is fine.\n\nSo all three moves seem safe from enemy\u2019s possible moves.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Apple proximity and future mobility**\n\nFrom (2, 8):\n- Closest apple: (3, 9) distance Manhattan = |3-2|+|9-8| = 2.\n- Other apples: (6, 8) distance 4, (7, 8) distance 5, (6, 3) distance 7, (0, 1) distance 9.\n\nCheck each move:\n\n1. UP to (2, 9): distance to (3, 9) = 1, very close. Next turn from (2, 9), safe moves: DOWN (2, 8) \u2013 my old head? Wait, old head (2, 8) will be body segment next turn? Actually, after I move UP to (2, 9), my body becomes [(2,9), (2,8), (1,7), (1,6)]? No, I don\u2019t grow unless I eat an apple. My length stays 4, so tail (1,6) disappears, body becomes [(2,9), (2,8), (1,7)]. So (2, 8) is body next turn, so DOWN from (2, 9) is into my own body \u2192 deadly next turn. So from (2, 9), possible moves: UP? (2, 10) out of bounds. So only LEFT (1, 9) and RIGHT (3, 9) are safe next turn. That\u2019s 2 safe moves.\n\n2. LEFT to (1, 8): distance to (3, 9) = 3. Next turn from (1, 8), safe moves: UP (1, 9), DOWN (1, 7) \u2013 is (1, 7) free? Next turn my body: [(1,8), (2,8), (2,7), (1,7)]? Wait, tail (1,6) gone, so body = [(1,8), (2,8), (2,7)]. So (1,7) is free. DOWN safe. LEFT (0, 8) safe. So 3 safe moves.\n\n3. RIGHT to (3, 8): distance to (3, 9) = 1. Next turn from (3, 8), body = [(3,8), (2,8), (2,7), (1,7)]? No, tail gone: body = [(3,8), (2,8), (2,7)]. So safe moves from (3, 8): UP (3, 9) \u2013 apple there, DOWN (3, 7), RIGHT (4, 8). LEFT (2, 8) is body \u2192 deadly. So 3 safe moves.\n\nSo UP gives fewer future moves (2), LEFT and RIGHT give 3 each.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Risk of enemy cutting off path to apple**\n\nEnemy at (5, 8) could move LEFT to (4, 8) or RIGHT to (6, 8). If I go RIGHT to (3, 8), enemy going LEFT to (4, 8) puts it adjacent to me, but not blocking yet. If I go UP to (2, 9), enemy could go UP to (5, 9), not blocking. If I go LEFT to (1, 8), enemy is far.\n\nGiven apple at (3, 9), going RIGHT to (3, 8) sets me up to eat it next turn with UP to (3, 9) unless enemy gets there first. Enemy\u2019s closest path to (3, 9): from (5, 8) to (3, 9) requires two moves (e.g., LEFT to (4, 8) then UP to (4, 9) then LEFT to (3, 9) \u2014 three moves). So I can get there first.\n\nBut if I go RIGHT to (3, 8), enemy might move LEFT to (4, 8) and be adjacent, possibly risking head-on next turn if I move to (4, 8) then. But I don\u2019t need to go to (4, 8); I can go UP to (3, 9) to eat apple.\n\nEating apple will grow me, so after eating, my body will include (3, 9), (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), tail gone? Actually, growth means tail doesn\u2019t disappear, so length becomes 5. That\u2019s fine.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Choose best move**\n\nUP (2, 9) gives fewer options next turn (only 2 moves), riskier if enemy moves near.  \nLEFT (1, 8) is safe but delays apple.  \nRIGHT (3, 8) is safe, gives 3 future moves, and positions to eat (3, 9) next turn.\n\nI\u2019ll choose RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (3, 8), if apple at (3, 9) is still there, take it unless enemy head is at (3, 9) or (4, 9) threatening collision. Otherwise, consider DOWN or RIGHT to stay safe and target other apples.\n\nRIGHT",
