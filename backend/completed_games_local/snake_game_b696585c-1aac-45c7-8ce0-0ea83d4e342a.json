Is that safe?  \n  - Within board: yes (y=4, x=9).  \n  - Not my body: I have no body yet.  \n  - Not enemy body: enemy has no body yet.  \n  - Not enemy head moving into same cell? Enemy head is at (4,9). Could enemy move to (9,4)? No, too far. But head-on collision only if we both choose same cell. Enemy could move DOWN from (4,9) to (4,8), LEFT to (3,9), RIGHT to (5,9), UP is off board. So (9,4) is safe from head-on collision this turn.  \n  - Safe.\n\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,2).  \n  - Within board: yes.  \n  - No body issues.  \n  - Enemy can't reach (9,2) in one move.  \n  - Safe.\n\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,3).  \n  - Within board: yes.  \n  - Safe.\n\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10,3) \u2192 off board (x max is 9) \u2192 **death**. Eliminate RIGHT.\n\nSo RIGHT is out.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Evaluate remaining moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) for strategic value:**\n\nApples closest to me:\n1. (8,4) \u2013 distance from (9,3): Manhattan distance = |9-8| + |3-4| = 1+1=2.\n2. (7,7) \u2013 distance = |9-7| + |3-7| = 2+4=6.\n3. (3,2) \u2013 distance = 6+1=7.\n4. (9,9) \u2013 distance = 0+6=6.\n5. (0,0) \u2013 far.\n\nClosest apple is (8,4).\n\nWhich move gets me closer to (8,4)?\n- UP (9,4): distance to (8,4) = 1.\n- DOWN (9,2): distance = 1+2=3.\n- LEFT (8,3): distance = 0+1=1.\n\nBoth UP and LEFT are equally close (distance 1) to (8,4). DOWN is farther.\n\nCheck enemy position: enemy at (4,9). It might go for (9,9) apple or (7,7) apple. Not an immediate threat to me.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future mobility:**\nFrom (9,3):\n- If I go UP to (9,4): next turn possible moves: UP (9,5), DOWN (9,3), LEFT (8,4) \u2013 which is apple. That\u2019s good. Three options likely safe unless enemy moves into them.\n- If I go LEFT to (8,3): next turn possible moves: UP (8,4) apple, DOWN (8,2), RIGHT (9,3), LEFT (7,3). Also three options.\nBoth seem similar.\n\nBut consider: If I go LEFT to (8,3), I\u2019m closer to center, more open space. From (9,4) I\u2019m near top edge (y=4 is middle, but x=9 is right edge). Edge reduces options slightly (RIGHT off board). Actually from (9,4), RIGHT is off board, so only UP, DOWN, LEFT. From (8,3), all four directions are on board.\n\nSo LEFT gives more future mobility.\n\nAlso, going LEFT now avoids potential future trap in top-right corner.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn:**\nEnemy at (4,9). It might go DOWN to (4,8) or LEFT to (3,9) or RIGHT to (5,9). No chance it reaches my target cells (9,4), (9,2), (8,3). So safe.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**\nI should aim for nearest apple (8,4) next turn if possible, while staying safe from enemy. Enemy is far away for now. Keep moving toward center to maintain options.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move toward (8,4) apple, then (7,7) or (3,2) depending on enemy movement. Avoid getting trapped against walls.\n\n**Final choice:** LEFT (to (8,3)) \u2013 gets me equally close to apple (8,4) as UP would, but with better future mobility.\n\nLEFT",

Moving UP to (8,4) would eat that apple immediately, giving me my first point and growing to length 2.\n\nLet's evaluate safety for each possible move:\n\n1. **UP to (8,4)** \u2013 On board. No body segments. Enemy snake #1 is at (5,9), far away. No risk of moving into enemy body (they have none). Could there be a head-on collision? Enemy could move DOWN to (5,8), LEFT to (4,9), RIGHT to (6,9), or UP to (5,10) which is off-board. None of these reach (8,4). So UP is safe.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8,2)** \u2013 On board. Safe from immediate death.\n\n3. **LEFT to (7,3)** \u2013 On board. Safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9,3)** \u2013 On board. Safe.\n\nAll four moves are immediately safe.\n\n**Strategic choice:**  \nUP directly collects the apple at (8,4). This gives me an early lead and grows my snake, which is beneficial. The only downside is that after eating, my body will occupy (8,3) (my current head position), so next turn I must avoid moving back into that cell. However, from (8,4) my possible moves would be UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT, and only DOWN would go back into my new body segment\u2014so I'd just avoid DOWN next turn.\n\nThe enemy is far away and not an immediate threat. Grabbing the nearest apple now is optimal. Moving LEFT or DOWN doesn't get me closer to any apple than UP does. RIGHT keeps me stationary relative to the apple.\n\n**Future mobility:** After eating the apple at (8,4), I'll be at y=4, x=8, with my tail at (8,3). That's a central position with three directions open (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) since DOWN would be into my own body next turn. That's still good flexibility.\n\n**Long-term plan:** After eating this apple, assess the board again. The next closest apples are (7,7) and (3,2). Given the enemy's position at (5,9), they might head toward (7,7) or (9,9). I should consider moving toward (7,7) or (3,2) while avoiding potential head-on collisions.\n\n**Final decision:** UP to eat the apple.\n\nUP",

DOWN would go into (8,4) (my new body) \u2192 not safe next turn. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n- If I go LEFT to (7,4): body at (8,4),(8,3). From (7,4), possible moves: all four directions? Check: UP (7,5) free, DOWN (7,3) free, LEFT (6,4) free, RIGHT (8,4) is my body \u2192 so RIGHT would be unsafe next turn. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n- If I go RIGHT to (9,4): body at (8,4),(8,3). From (9,4), possible moves: UP (9,5) free, DOWN (9,3) free, LEFT (8,4) is my body \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT off-board \u2192 unsafe. So only 2 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN).  \n\nSo RIGHT reduces future options.  \n\n**Strategic choice:** Between UP and LEFT, both equally close to apple (7,7). UP keeps me more central, LEFT moves me toward left side where apple (3,2) and (3,7) also are. Enemy is at (6,9), likely heading toward (7,7) or (9,9). If I move LEFT to (7,4), I might get to (7,7) in 3 moves (UP thrice). Enemy from (6,9) to (7,7) is 3 moves (DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN?). Actually (6,9)\u2192(7,7) = 1+2=3 moves. We could race.  \n\nBut moving UP to (8,5) also gets me to (7,7) in 3 moves (LEFT, UP, UP). Similar race.  \n\nGiven enemy has no body yet, it can move freely. I should maybe avoid moving directly toward the same apple if enemy might also aim there, risking head-on later. But not an immediate risk this turn.  \n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:** After this move, aim for apple (7,7) but watch enemy\u2019s movement. If enemy moves toward (7,7), maybe switch target to (3,7) or (3,2) to avoid collision. Keep growing safely.  \n\n**Decision:** I\u2019ll choose UP to (8,5) because it keeps good mobility and progresses toward (7,7) while staying central.  \n\nUP",

If I move LEFT, I might avoid direct competition for (7,7) and instead target (3,7) or (3,2), which are farther from the enemy.\n\nGiven I have a slight lead (1 apple vs 0), playing cautiously and avoiding potential future head-on collisions near contested apples is wise. Moving LEFT sets me on a path toward less contested apples and keeps good mobility.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:** After moving LEFT to (7,5), consider moving UP toward (7,7) if enemy is not threatening it, or continue LEFT/DOWN toward (3,7) or (3,2). Monitor enemy's movement\u2014if it moves toward (7,7), I may want to avoid that area and target the left-side apples.\n\n**Decision:** I'll choose LEFT to (7,5) to start moving toward the cluster of apples on the left while maintaining good future mobility and avoiding potential conflict near (7,7).\n\nLEFT",

However, the enemy at (8,9) is also close. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (9,9) to eat that apple, it will be farther from (7,7). If the enemy moves DOWN to (8,8), it could then move LEFT to (7,8) and compete for (7,7). Since we move simultaneously, I cannot guarantee I'll reach (7,7) first if I move UP now \u2013 I'd need to move UP again next turn, and the enemy could potentially move into (7,7) on the same turn I try to eat it, causing a head-on collision.\n\nGiven my lead (1 apple vs 0), a more conservative approach might be to avoid direct competition and target the apples on the left side (3,7) and (3,2), which are farther from the enemy. Moving LEFT now starts that journey.\n\nHowever, moving UP to (7,6) keeps options open: next turn I can assess the enemy's position and decide whether to go for (7,7) or move LEFT/RIGHT to avoid conflict. It also positions me closer to the top-right apples if the enemy moves away.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:** After moving UP to (7,6), evaluate enemy's move. If enemy moves toward (7,7) (e.g., to (7,9) or (8,8)), consider avoiding head-on and instead move LEFT toward (6,6) to target left-side apples. If enemy moves away (e.g., RIGHT to (9,9)), then consider moving UP to (7,7) to safely eat it.\n\nGiven the proximity and the value of collecting apples to extend my lead, I'll move UP to position myself for a potential safe capture of (7,7) next turn, while maintaining flexibility.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n\nSo UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe from self-collision.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head is at **(9,9)** with body at (8,9). Its possible safe moves:\n- UP to (9,10) \u2192 off-board \u2192 dies.\n- DOWN to (9,8) \u2192 free.\n- LEFT to (8,9) \u2192 its own body \u2192 dies.\n- RIGHT to (10,9) \u2192 off-board \u2192 dies.\n\nSo the enemy's only safe move is **DOWN to (9,8)**.\n\nMy possible head positions next turn: (7,7), (6,6), (8,6).\n\nCheck for overlap with enemy's only possible move (9,8):\n- (7,7) vs (9,8): No.\n- (6,6) vs (9,8): No.\n- (8,6) vs (9,8): No.\n\nNo direct head-on collision possible this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and strategic movement.**\n\nFrom my head (7,6):\n- **UP to (7,7)**: Directly onto an apple. I would eat it, grow to length 3, and gain a point.\n- **LEFT to (6,6)**: Manhattan distance to nearest apple (3,7) = |6-3|+|6-7| = 3+1 = 4.\n- **RIGHT to (8,6)**: Distance to apple (8,5) = |8-8|+|6-5| = 0+1 = 1 (adjacent vertically).\n\nMoving UP to eat the apple at (7,7) is the most immediate gain. However, I must consider the enemy's position. The enemy is forced to move DOWN to (9,8), which is two steps away from (7,7). It cannot reach (7,7) next turn. Therefore, moving onto (7,7) is safe from head-on collision with the enemy this turn.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility after each move.**\n\nIf I eat the apple (move UP), my body will become: new head at (7,7), old head (7,6) becomes body, old body (7,5) remains. My length will be 3.\n\nFrom (7,7) next turn, possible moves:\n- UP to (7,8): free.\n- DOWN to (7,6): my new body \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (6,7): free.\n- RIGHT to (8,7): free.\n\u2192 3 safe moves next turn. Good mobility.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,6) or RIGHT to (8,6), I do not eat an apple this turn. My body becomes: new head at chosen cell, old head (7,6) becomes body, old body (7,5) remains. Length stays 2.\n\nFrom (6,6) or (8,6), I would have 3 safe moves next turn (since one direction leads back into my new body). However, moving RIGHT to (8,6) positions me right above the apple at (8,5), which I could eat next turn by moving DOWN, provided it's still there and safe.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and risk assessment.**\n\nThe safest and most advantageous move is **UP to (7,7)** to eat the apple. This extends my lead (2 apples vs enemy's 1). The enemy is forced away and cannot interfere. There is no risk of head-on collision, and the cell is free.\n\nMoving LEFT or RIGHT avoids immediate growth but keeps me safe. However, given the forced enemy move, I have a clear opportunity to collect an apple with zero competition.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating the apple at (7,7), my head will be at (7,7) with a length of 3. The enemy will be at (9,8). I should then assess the board for the nearest safe apple\u2014likely (8,5) is close, but I must check the enemy's possible moves from (9,8) to avoid walking into a trap or head-on collision. I may consider moving towards the left-side apples (3,7) or (3,2) to draw away from the enemy, or cautiously approach (8,5) if the enemy's path is clear.\n\nUP",

The enemy could potentially move down the column and contest it. Moving LEFT towards (3,7) might be safer as it draws me away from the enemy.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility after each move.**\nIf I move UP to (7,8): From there, safe moves likely UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN into my new body at (7,7) would be unsafe).

I can eat it next turn by moving LEFT again. This is the most direct path to growth.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility after each move.**\nIf I move UP to (5,8): From there, safe moves likely UP, DOWN, LEFT (RIGHT into (6,8) is currently empty, but enemy could move there). Good.\nIf I move DOWN to (5,6): From there, safe moves likely UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (my new body at (5,7) would be above). Good.\nIf I move LEFT to (4,7): From there, safe moves likely UP, DOWN, LEFT (RIGHT into my new body at (5,7) unsafe). Good.\nAll three offer good mobility.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and risk assessment.**\nMy lead (2 apples vs 1) is small. Securing the apple at (3,7) is a priority as it's uncontested. The enemy is closer to the apple at (8,5) and may move towards it (DOWN to (7,7) or LEFT to (6,8)). Moving LEFT continues my path away from the enemy and towards safe growth. I should also consider that after eating the apple at (3,7), my tail will remain at (7,7) for a few moves, opening up space behind me.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move LEFT to (4,7) this turn. Next turn, move LEFT to (3,7) to eat the apple. After eating, I will be longer, so I need to plan an escape route from (3,7). From there, possible moves are UP, DOWN, or RIGHT (back into my body at (4,7) would be unsafe). I should likely go DOWN towards (3,6) to explore the lower-left area and potentially target the apple at (3,2) or (0,0), while keeping distance from the enemy in the top-right.\n\nLEFT",

The RIGHT move to (7, 8) is my own body from the previous turn.

Moving UP takes me further from most apples and closer to the enemy's territory (top-right).

However, moving DOWN starts me on a path toward the dense apple area (bottom-left) and away from the enemy, who is in the top-right. The enemy is likely to target (8,5) or (5,4). I should secure the uncontested apples first.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and risk assessment.**\nMy plan from last turn was to move DOWN after eating the apple to explore the lower-left. I should execute that. The enemy is at (6,9) and will likely move LEFT or RIGHT. It poses no immediate threat. My priority is to safely collect apples (3,2) and (0,0) while monitoring the enemy's movement. I should avoid moving into the center where the enemy might descend for (5,4). Moving DOWN now is consistent and safe.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After moving DOWN to (3,6), assess the safest route to (3,2). Likely continue DOWN, then LEFT toward (0,0).

          "rationale": "Looking at the board, my head is at **(3,6)**. My body is [(3,7), (4,7), (5,7)]. I have 3 apples. Apples are at (3,2), (0,0), (8,5), (6,0), (5,4). Enemy snake #1 is at **(7,9)** with body [(6,9)].\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (3,6).**\n- **UP to (3,7)**: That's my own body segment. **Eliminated**.\n- **DOWN to (3,5)**: Within board. Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (2,6)**: Within board. Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (4,6)**: Within board. Empty. Safe.\n\nSo DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe from self-collision.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\nEnemy head is at **(7,9)** with body at (6,9). Its possible safe moves:\n- UP to (7,10): Out of bounds \u2192 dies.\n- DOWN to (7,8): Within board, empty. Safe.\n- LEFT to (6,9): That's its own body \u2192 dies.\n- RIGHT to (8,9): Within board, empty. Safe.\nSo enemy's only safe moves are **DOWN to (7,8)** and **RIGHT to (8,9)**.\n\nMy possible head positions next turn: (3,5), (2,6), (4,6).\nCheck for overlap with enemy's possible moves (7,8), (8,9):\n- All my possible positions are far from (7,8) and (8,9). No direct head-on collision possible this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and strategic movement.**\nFrom my head (3,6):\n- **DOWN to (3,5)**: Manhattan distance to apple (3,2) = |3-3|+|5-2| = 0+3 = 3. Distance to (5,4)=3, (0,0)=8, (6,0)=6, (8,5)=7.\n- **LEFT to (2,6)**: Distance to apple (5,4)=|2-5|+|6-4|=3+2=5. To (3,2)=|2-3|+|6-2|=1+4=5. To (0,0)=8. To (6,0)=8. To (8,5)=9.\n- **RIGHT to (4,6)**: Distance to apple (5,4)=|4-5|+|6-4|=1+2=3. To (3,2)=|4-3|+|6-2|=1+4=5. To (0,0)=10. To (6,0)=4. To (8,5)=4.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT get me to distance 3 from a nearest apple. DOWN targets (3,2) and (5,4). RIGHT targets (5,4) and (6,0). However, moving RIGHT brings me closer to the enemy's general area (top-right). The enemy is at (7,9) and may move down/right. Moving DOWN continues my path toward the dense, uncontested apples in the bottom-left (3,2) and (0,0), which is consistent with my previous plan.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility after each move.**\n- **DOWN to (3,5)**: From there, safe moves would be DOWN to (3,4), LEFT to (2,5), RIGHT to (4,5). UP to (3,6) is now my body? Wait, after moving, my body will be [(3,6), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7)]. So (3,6) is my new neck, so moving UP back to it is fatal. So 3 safe exits.\n- **LEFT to (2,6)**: From there, safe moves would be DOWN to (2,5), LEFT to (1,6), RIGHT to (3,6) (my body, fatal), UP to (2,7) (empty). Actually, UP (2,7) is empty. So safe: DOWN, LEFT, UP = 3 exits.\n- **RIGHT to (4,6)**: From there, safe moves would be DOWN to (4,5), LEFT to (3,6) (my body, fatal), RIGHT to (5,6), UP to (4,7) (my body, fatal). So only DOWN and RIGHT are safe? Let's check: UP (4,7) is part of my body [(3,7), (4,7), (5,7)]? Yes, (4,7) is my second segment. So UP is fatal. LEFT is fatal. So only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. That's only 2 safe exits, reducing my future mobility. **This is a significant drawback.**\n\nMoving RIGHT severely limits my next move options, increasing risk of getting trapped. DOWN and LEFT both offer 3 safe exits.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and risk assessment.**\nMy plan from last turn was to head toward the bottom-left apples (3,2) and (0,0). Moving DOWN continues that plan directly and maintains good mobility. The enemy is distant and not an immediate threat. The apple at (5,4) is tempting but contested; the enemy may go for it. Securing the two apples in the lower-left first seems safer and builds my lead.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After moving DOWN to (3,5), proceed toward (3,2) via DOWN, then likely LEFT toward (0,0). Monitor enemy movement\u2014if it moves toward (5,4), I may need to decide whether to loop back for it after securing the lower apples, or let it have it and focus on others.\n\nDOWN",

My long-term plan from last turn was to secure the bottom-left apples (3,2) and (0,0). Moving DOWN directly progresses that plan and puts me one step away from eating (3,2). The apple at (5,4) is also close, but moving RIGHT would put me adjacent to it, but then my body behind me (at (3,4)) might block immediate consumption if I need to maneuver. Since (3,2) is closer to my current path and aligns with my plan, DOWN is preferable.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility after each move.**\n- **DOWN to (3,3)**: From there, safe moves would be DOWN to (3,2) (apple), LEFT to (2,3), RIGHT to (4,3). UP to (3,4) is now my neck (body segment after move), so fatal. So 3 safe exits, one leads directly to an apple.\n- **LEFT to (2,4)**: From there, safe moves would be DOWN to (2,3), LEFT to (1,4), RIGHT to (3,4) (my body, fatal), UP to (2,5) (empty). So safe: DOWN, LEFT, UP = 3 exits.\n- **RIGHT to (4,4)**: From there, safe moves would be DOWN to (4,3), LEFT to (3,4) (my body, fatal), RIGHT to (5,4) (apple), UP to (4,5) (empty). So safe: DOWN, RIGHT, UP = 3 exits, one leads to an apple.\n\nAll three safe moves offer 3 safe exits. DOWN and RIGHT each put me one step from an apple next turn.\n\n**Step 5: Decision and plan.**\nDOWN is consistent with my previous plan to secure (3,2). Eating an apple increases my score and length, which is beneficial. The enemy is far away in the top-right, so no immediate threat. Moving DOWN to (3,3) sets me up to eat (3,2) next turn unless something unexpected happens.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After moving DOWN to (3,3), I will move DOWN again to (3,2) to eat the apple, unless the enemy suddenly moves into that area or a head-on collision risk emerges. After eating, I can consider moving toward (0,0) or (5,4) depending on the board state.\n\nDOWN",

I have a solid lead (4 apples vs 1).\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (4,2).**  \nMy body segments are at: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5).  \n- **UP to (4,3)**: Empty. Safe.  \n- **DOWN to (4,1)**: Empty. Safe.  \n- **LEFT to (3,2)**: That's my own body. **Eliminated**.  \n- **RIGHT to (5,2)**: Empty. Safe.  \n\nSo UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are safe from self-collision.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1's position and possible moves.**  \nEnemy head is at (7,6), body at (7,7). Its safe moves:  \n- UP to (7,7): Its own body. **Eliminated**.  \n- DOWN to (7,5): Empty.  \n- LEFT to (6,6): Empty.  \n- RIGHT to (8,6): Empty.  \n\nMy possible next head positions are (4,3), (4,1), (5,2). None of these conflict with the enemy's possible moves ((7,5), (6,6), (8,6)), so no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity.**  \nApples at: (0,0), (8,5), (6,0), (5,4), (5,0).  \nFrom my head (4,2):  \n- **UP to (4,3)**: Manhattan distances: to (5,4)=2, to (8,5)=6, to (5,0)=4, to (6,0)=5, to (0,0)=7.  \n- **DOWN to (4,1)**: Distances: to (5,0)=2, to (6,0)=3, to (0,0)=5, to (5,4)=4.  \n- **RIGHT to (5,2)**: Distances: to (5,4)=2, to (5,0)=2, to (6,0)=3, to (8,5)=4, to (0,0)=7.  \n\nRIGHT puts me equidistant to the cluster at (5,4) and (5,0). UP gets me closest to (5,4). DOWN gets me closest to (5,0). The apple at (5,4) is one step away from (5,2) or (4,3).\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility and board control.**  \n- **UP to (4,3)**: Next turn, my neck will be at (4,2). Safe moves would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT? Need to check: From (4,3), moving LEFT to (3,3) would be my body? Actually, my body after moving UP would be: head (4,3), then (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). So (3,3) is occupied. So from (4,3), safe moves: UP to (4,4), DOWN to (4,2) (neck, fatal), LEFT to (3,3) (body), RIGHT to (5,3). That's only 2 safe exits (UP, RIGHT). This is a bit restrictive.  \n- **DOWN to (4,1)**: Next turn, neck at (4,2). Body: head (4,1), then (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). From (4,1), safe moves: DOWN to (4,0), LEFT to (3,1), RIGHT to (5,1). UP to (4,2) is neck. So 3 safe exits.  \n- **RIGHT to (5,2)**: Next turn, neck at (4,2). Body: head (5,2), then (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). From (5,2), safe moves: UP to (5,3), DOWN to (5,1), RIGHT to (6,2). LEFT to (4,2) is neck. So 3 safe exits.\n\nDOWN and RIGHT offer better future mobility (3 exits) than UP (2 exits). Given my lead, maintaining options is wise.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and enemy consideration.**  \nThe enemy is in the top-right. I'm in the center-left. The apples at (5,4) and (5,0) are prime targets. Moving RIGHT to (5,2) positions me perfectly to go UP to (5,3) then to (5,4), or DOWN to (5,1) then to (5,0). It also keeps me away from the enemy's likely path. Moving DOWN also works, but RIGHT feels more central and gives equal access to both apple rows. I should avoid moving towards the crowded left wall where my long body is.\n\n**Final decision:**  \nRIGHT\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** From (5,2), assess safety and target either (5,4) or (5,0). Enemy is distant; maintain mobility and avoid boxing myself in. Keep an eye on enemy's possible approach vector.\n\nRIGHT",

That's 3 safe exits (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Actually, UP leads to apple, which is good.  \n- **DOWN to (5,1)**: Next turn, neck at (5,2). Body: head (5,1), then (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4).

UP and DOWN each put me one step from an apple, which is highly desirable.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and enemy consideration.**  \nThe enemy is at (8,6) and may move toward the apple at (8,5). That's far from me. I have a strong lead, so securing another apple quickly is wise. Both (5,4) and (5,0) are reachable. Moving UP to (5,3) sets up to eat (5,4) next turn. Moving DOWN to (5,1) sets up to eat (5,0) next turn. Which is safer?  \n- If I go UP, next turn I can eat (5,4) unless the enemy somehow interferes (unlikely).  \n- If I go DOWN, next turn I can eat (5,0).  \n\nThe apple at (5,4) is closer to the center, while (5,0) is near the bottom edge. Being near an edge can limit mobility later. However, my long body is along x=3, so moving UP keeps me more central. Also, the enemy is in the top-right, so moving UP might slightly increase proximity, but still far enough.\n\nGiven my lead, I should prioritize securing an apple while maintaining future options. UP to (5,3) is optimal because it positions me to eat (5,4) next turn, after which I can reassess.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** From (5,3), if safe, move UP to (5,4) to eat the apple. Check for enemy movements \u2014 they might be heading toward (8,5). After eating, my tail will grow, but my body will still be mostly on the left. Plan to then move rightward to open space and avoid trapping myself.\n\nUP",

Immediate point and growth.  \n- **LEFT to (4,3)**: Manhattan distances: to (4,4)=1, to (5,4)=2, to (5,0)=4, to (6,0)=4, to (0,0)=7.  \n- **RIGHT to (6,3)**: Distances: to (6,0)=3, to (5,4)=2, to (5,0)=4, to (4,4)=3, to (0,0)=9.  \n\nUP is the only move that gets an apple this turn. Eating an apple extends my lead to 5 vs 2 and grows my body, which is strategically strong.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility after each move.**  \n- **UP to (5,4) (eat apple)**: Next turn, my new head will be at (5,4). My body will grow by 1, so my tail won't move. Body will be: head (5,4), then (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3). From (5,4), safe moves next turn would need checking, but I'll have just eaten, securing a point.  \n- **LEFT to (4,3)**: Next turn, neck at (5,3). From (4,3), likely safe moves: UP to (4,4) (apple), DOWN to (4,2) (my body), LEFT to (3,3) (my body), RIGHT to (5,3) (neck). So only UP might be safe, which is risky (only 1 exit).  \n- **RIGHT to (6,3)**: Next turn, neck at (5,3). From (6,3), safe moves: UP to (6,4), DOWN to (6,2), RIGHT to (7,3). LEFT to (5,3) is neck. That's 3 safe exits, better mobility.\n\nHowever, UP gives an immediate apple and a point. While it might slightly reduce mobility next turn because my body is longer and around (5,3), the gain is worth it. I have a significant lead, and securing another apple quickly pressures the opponent.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan.**  \nMy strategy is to maintain my apple lead while avoiding traps. After eating the apple at (5,4), my body will be longer, so I need to plan an escape route from the top-left area. My body currently blocks leftward movement from (5,4). Next turn, from (5,4), I should consider moving RIGHT to (6,4) or UP to (5,5) if safe, to open space and avoid getting encircled by my own body. The enemy is far away at (8,5), likely moving toward the apple at (4,4) or (6,0). I should monitor its direction.\n\nGiven the above, **UP** is the best move: it secures an apple this turn, extends my lead, and is safe from immediate collisions. The other moves don't provide an immediate point and have mobility concerns (LEFT leads to a potential dead-end next turn).\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** From (5,4) after eating, check safe moves: likely UP, RIGHT, maybe DOWN? DOWN to (5,3) is my new neck, so fatal. So options are UP to (5,5) or RIGHT to (6,4). Prefer RIGHT to move toward center and away from my clustered body. Also, watch if enemy moves toward (4,4) or (6,0).\n\nUP",

I have 5 apples vs enemy's 2.\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (5,4).**\n- **UP to (5,5)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN to (5,3)**: That's my own body (second segment). **Eliminated**.\n- **LEFT to (4,4)**: Contains an apple. Safe (eating is allowed).\n- **RIGHT to (6,4)**: Empty. Safe.\n\nSo UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe from self-collision.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1's position and possible moves.**\nEnemy head is at (9,5), body at (8,5), (8,6). Its safe moves from (9,5):\n- UP to (9,6): Empty.\n- DOWN to (9,4): Empty.\n- LEFT to (8,5): Its own body. **Eliminated**.\n- RIGHT: Off board (x=10). **Eliminated**.\n\nIts possible next heads are (9,6) and (9,4). My possible next heads are (5,5), (4,4), (6,4). No overlap, so no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and eating opportunity.**\nApples at: (0,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,4), (5,8).\nFrom my head (5,4):\n- **LEFT to (4,4)**: Directly onto an apple. Immediate point and growth.\n- **UP to (5,5)**: Manhattan distances: to (5,8)=3, to (4,4)=2, to (6,0)=6, to (5,0)=5, to (0,0)=9.\n- **RIGHT to (6,4)**: Distances: to (6,0)=4, to (5,8)=4, to (5,0)=4, to (4,4)=2, to (0,0)=10.\n\nLEFT is the only move that gets an apple this turn. Eating extends my lead to 6 vs 2.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility after each move.**\n- **LEFT to (4,4) (eat apple)**: Next turn, my body grows. New body: head (4,4), then (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3). From (4,4), safe moves next turn would need checking, but I'll have just eaten.\n- **UP to (5,5)**: Next turn, neck at (5,4). From (5,5), safe moves: UP to (5,6), LEFT to (4,5), RIGHT to (6,5). DOWN to (5,4) is neck. That's 3 safe exits, good mobility.\n- **RIGHT to (6,4)**: Next turn, neck at (5,4). From (6,4), safe moves: UP to (6,5), DOWN to (6,3), RIGHT to (7,4). LEFT to (5,4) is neck. That's 3 safe exits, good mobility.\n\nLEFT gives an immediate apple but places me at (4,4), which is surrounded by my body to the left (3,4 is empty but (3,3) and (3,2) are below) and the board edge. My mobility next turn might be limited. However, securing the apple is valuable given my lead.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and risk assessment.**\nMy lead is strong (5 vs 2). The enemy is on the right edge and may be trapped soon. The apple at (4,4) is the closest. Eating it could pressure the enemy further and bring me closer to 50. While UP or RIGHT offer better immediate future mobility, the guaranteed point from LEFT is strategically sound to press my advantage. After eating, from (4,4) I should plan to move UP to (4,5) or RIGHT to (5,4) (but that's my neck, so not possible) \u2014 actually, RIGHT to (5,4) would be my new neck, so fatal. So from (4,4) after eating, possible safe moves would be UP to (4,5) and maybe LEFT to (3,4) if not occupied. I need to check next turn carefully.\n\nGiven the above, **LEFT** is the best move: it secures an apple, extends my lead to 6, and is safe. The enemy is far and not an immediate threat.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** From (4,4) after eating, my body will be longer. Check safe moves: likely UP to (4,5) and possibly LEFT to (3,4) if not occupied by my body (check (3,4) is empty now, but after growth my tail is at (3,3)? Actually my tail is at (3,3) and will stay there since I ate, so (3,4) should be free). DOWN to (4,3) is my body (segment (5,3)? Wait, after growth, body is: (4,4) head, then (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3). So (4,3) is empty. But (5,3) is body, not (4,3). I need to recalc: from (4,4), DOWN is (4,3) \u2014 that cell is currently empty on board and not in my future body list? My future body list includes (5,3) but not (4,3). So DOWN might be safe. Will evaluate next turn. Priority is to move towards center or toward another apple (like (5,8) or (6,0)) while avoiding boxing myself in.\n\nLEFT",

From (3,5), safe moves: UP to (3,6), LEFT to (2,5), DOWN to (3,4). RIGHT to (4,5) is neck. That's 3 safe exits.\n- **RIGHT to (5,5)**: Next turn, neck at (4,5). From (5,5), safe moves: UP to (5,6), DOWN to (5,4) is my body? Future body: head (5,5), then (4,5), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2). So (5,4) is body (third segment). So DOWN is unsafe. RIGHT to (6,5) is empty. LEFT to (4,5) is neck. So only UP and RIGHT are safe\u20142 exits, which is acceptable but less flexible.\n\nAll three moves are viable, but RIGHT offers slightly fewer future options.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and risk assessment.**\nMy lead is strong (6 apples vs enemy's 2). The enemy is on the right side but not an immediate threat. The apple at (2,6) is attractive and reachable. Moving UP or LEFT both get me equally close to it. However, moving UP to (4,6) keeps me more central and may give better access to the upper board, including the apple at (5,8). Moving LEFT to (3,5) also works but edges me closer to the left wall. Given my body occupies columns 3-5 in lower rows, staying central might be better for future mobility.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** From (4,6), I can consider moving LEFT toward (2,6) or UP toward (5,8). Monitor enemy movement\u2014it's currently on the right edge and may move leftward. Continue to avoid boxing myself in; prioritize moves that keep at least 2 safe exits. The apple cluster at bottom-left (0,0), (5,0), (6,0) is still available but farther; maybe plan a route later if upper apples are taken.\n\nUP",

Enemy snake #1's head is at (7,6), body at [(8,6), (9,6)].\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (4,6).**\n- **UP to (4,7)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN to (4,5)**: That's my own body (second segment). **Eliminated**.\n- **LEFT to (3,6)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (5,6)**: Empty.

My possible next heads are (4,7), (3,6), (5,6). No overlap, so no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and eating opportunity.**\nFrom my head (4,6):\n- **UP to (4,7)**: Manhattan distances: to (2,6)=3, to (5,8)=2, to (5,0)=8, to (6,0)=9, to (0,0)=11.\n- **LEFT to (3,6)**: Distances: to (2,6)=1, to (5,8)=4, to (5,0)=8, to (6,0)=9, to (0,0)=9.\n- **RIGHT to (5,6)**: Distances: to (5,8)=2, to (2,6)=3, to (6,0)=6, to (5,0)=6, to (0,0)=11.\n\nThe closest apple is (2,6) at distance 1 from (3,6). Moving LEFT gets me directly adjacent to it. The apple at (5,8) is also close, distance 2 from both (4,7) and (5,6).\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility after each move.**\n- **UP to (4,7)**: Next turn, neck at (4,6). From (4,7), safe moves: UP to (4,8), LEFT to (3,7), RIGHT to (5,7). DOWN to (4,6) is neck. That's 3 safe exits.\n- **LEFT to (3,6)**: Next turn, neck at (4,6). From (3,6), safe moves: UP to (3,7), LEFT to (2,6) is the apple (safe to move onto), DOWN to (3,5). RIGHT to (4,6) is neck. That's 3 safe exits, and one leads directly to an apple.\n- **RIGHT to (5,6)**: Next turn, neck at (4,6). From (5,6), safe moves: UP to (5,7), RIGHT to (6,6) (but enemy could move there this turn\u2014check: enemy could move to (6,6), but that's not a head-on risk for this turn's move). DOWN to (5,5) is empty. LEFT to (4,6) is neck. That's 3 safe exits.\n\nAll three moves offer good future mobility.\n\n**Step 5: Decision and long-term plan.**\nMy lead is strong (6 apples vs 2). The apple at (2,6) is very close and moving LEFT to (3,6) positions me to eat it next turn (by moving LEFT again to (2,6)). This is a clear, safe path to increase my lead. Moving UP or RIGHT toward (5,8) is also reasonable, but the immediate gain from (2,6) is more direct.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's position. It's on the right edge and may move left toward (6,6), but that doesn't threaten my move to (3,6). My body occupies the central-left area, so moving LEFT keeps me in open space.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** If I move LEFT to (3,6), my next move should be LEFT to (2,6) to eat the apple, provided it's still there (no other snake eats it this turn). After eating, I'll need to assess escape routes from (2,6) to avoid trapping myself against the left wall. The upper board with the apple at (5,8) remains a target for later.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy snake #1's head is at (5,6), body at [(6,6), (7,6)].\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (2,6).**\n- **UP to (2,7)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN to (2,5)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (1,6)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (3,6)**: That's my own body (second segment). **Eliminated**.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe from self-collision.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1's position and possible moves.**\nEnemy head at (5,6), body at (6,6), (7,6). Its safe moves from (5,6):\n- UP to (5,7): Empty.\n- DOWN to (5,5): Empty.\n- LEFT to (4,6): That's my body (third segment). **Eliminated**.\n- RIGHT to (6,6): Its own body. **Eliminated**.\nIts possible next heads are (5,7) and (5,5). My possible next heads are (2,7), (2,5), (1,6). No overlap, so no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and eating opportunity.**\nFrom my head (2,6):\n- **UP to (2,7)**: Manhattan distances: to (5,8)=4, to (3,0)=10, to (5,0)=10, to (6,0)=11, to (0,0)=13.\n- **DOWN to (2,5)**: Distances: to (3,0)=6, to (5,0)=8, to (6,0)=9, to (5,8)=6, to (0,0)=7.\n- **LEFT to (1,6)**: Distances: to (0,0)=7, to (3,0)=9, to (5,0)=11, to (6,0)=12, to (5,8)=8.\n\nNo immediate apple consumption. The closest apple is (5,8) from UP (distance 4) and (3,0) from DOWN (distance 6). However, (5,8) is north-east, while (3,0) is south.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility after each move.**\n- **UP to (2,7)**: Next turn, neck at (2,6). From (2,7), safe moves: UP to (2,8), LEFT to (1,7), RIGHT to (3,7). DOWN to (2,6) is neck. That's 3 safe exits.\n- **DOWN to (2,5)**: Next turn, neck at (2,6). From (2,5), safe moves: LEFT to (1,5), RIGHT to (3,5), DOWN to (2,4). UP to (2,6) is neck. That's 3 safe exits.\n- **LEFT to (1,6)**: Next turn, neck at (2,6). From (1,6), safe moves: UP to (1,7), LEFT to (0,6), DOWN to (1,5). RIGHT to (2,6) is neck. That's 3 safe exits.\n\nAll three safe moves offer good future mobility.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and apple targeting.**\nI have a significant lead (7 apples vs 2). My primary goal is to stay alive and maintain my lead. The enemy is confined to the right side and may struggle to find apples. The apples are mostly on the bottom row (0,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0) and one at the top (5,8). Moving DOWN gets me closer to the cluster of apples at the bottom. Moving UP gets me closer to the single apple at (5,8), but that path may bring me closer to the enemy's area. Moving LEFT keeps me safe but away from most apples.\n\nGiven my long body, I should avoid boxing myself in. Moving DOWN to (2,5) seems promising: it opens a path toward the bottom apples while keeping multiple exits. From there, I can consider moving LEFT/DOWN toward (0,0) or RIGHT/DOWN toward (3,0), (5,0), (6,0). The enemy is at (5,6) and likely moving UP or DOWN, so the bottom row should be relatively clear.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** After moving DOWN to (2,5), assess the path to the nearest apple (likely (3,0)). Consider moving DOWN again to (2,4) or LEFT to (1,5) to start circling toward the bottom-left. Avoid moving right into the column x=3-5 where my body is stacked. Monitor enemy's position\u2014if it moves DOWN to (5,5), it could become a competitor for the bottom apples.\n\nDOWN",

Moving RIGHT gets me closer to the top apple (5,8) as well, but that's also where the enemy is likely heading (to (5,8)). Moving DOWN is a safer path toward the bottom apple cluster.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility after each move.**\n- **DOWN to (2,4)**: Next turn, neck at (2,5). From (2,4), safe moves: LEFT to (1,4), RIGHT to (3,4), DOWN to (2,3). UP to (2,5) is neck. That's 3 safe exits.\n- **LEFT to (1,5)**: Next turn, neck at (2,5). From (1,5), safe moves: UP to (1,6), LEFT to (0,5), DOWN to (1,4). RIGHT to (2,5) is neck. That's 3 safe exits.\n- **RIGHT to (3,5)**: Next turn, neck at (2,5). From (3,5), safe moves: UP to (3,6) (my body at (3,6)? Wait, my body segment at (3,6) is still there. That would be a self-collision next turn if I go UP. Let's check carefully: My body is [(2,6), (3,6), (4,6), ...]. So (3,6) is occupied. Therefore, from (3,5), safe moves: DOWN to (3,4), LEFT to (2,5) is neck, RIGHT to (4,5) (my body at (4,5)? Yes, (4,5) is occupied. So only DOWN to (3,4) is safe? That's a dead end next turn. **Eliminated** because it severely limits future options and risks trapping me.\n\nRIGHT is dangerous because it leaves only one safe exit next turn (DOWN to (3,4)), which could easily lead to a trap.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and apple targeting.**\nI have a strong lead (7 apples vs 2). My priority is safety and maintaining the lead. The enemy is likely to move UP to (5,8) to eat that apple, which would bring its head to (5,8). That's fine; it keeps it away from the bottom cluster. My best path is toward the bottom apples (0,0), (3,0), (5,0), (6,0). Moving DOWN to (2,4) is a direct step toward (3,0) and keeps my options open with three exits. Moving LEFT to (1,5) is also safe but slightly less direct toward the apples.\n\nGiven that RIGHT is eliminated due to poor future mobility, I choose between DOWN and LEFT. DOWN is more aggressive toward the apple cluster and keeps me centered for future moves to either side. LEFT is conservative and might be safer if I want to avoid the enemy entirely, but the enemy is far away on the top-right.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** After moving DOWN to (2,4), assess the path to the nearest apple (likely (3,0)). Consider moving DOWN again to (2,3) or LEFT to (1,4) to approach. Avoid moving right into columns x=3-5 where my body is stacked. Monitor enemy's position\u2014if it ate the apple at (5,8), it will grow and its tail will stay, possibly blocking that area.\n\nDOWN",

No overlap, so no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and eating opportunity.**\nFrom my head (2,4):\n- **DOWN to (2,3)**: Manhattan distances: to (2,0)=3, to (3,0)=4, to (5,0)=6, to (6,0)=7, to (0,0)=5.\n- **LEFT to (1,4)**: Distances: to (0,0)=5, to (2,0)=5, to (3,0)=6, to (5,0)=8, to (6,0)=9.\n- **RIGHT to (3,4)**: Distances: to (3,0)=4, to (2,0)=5, to (5,0)=6, to (6,0)=7, to (0,0)=7.\n\nMoving DOWN gets me closest to the apple cluster, specifically (2,0) is only 3 steps away. LEFT and RIGHT are slightly farther.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility after each move.**\n- **DOWN to (2,3)**: Next turn, neck at (2,4). From (2,3), safe moves: LEFT to (1,3), RIGHT to (3,3), DOWN to (2,2). UP to (2,4) is neck. That's 3 safe exits.\n- **LEFT to (1,4)**: Next turn, neck at (2,4). From (1,4), safe moves: UP to (1,5), LEFT to (0,4), DOWN to (1,3). RIGHT to (2,4) is neck. That's 3 safe exits.\n- **RIGHT to (3,4)**: Next turn, neck at (2,4). From (3,4), safe moves: UP to (3,5) (empty), DOWN to (3,3) (empty), RIGHT to (4,4) (my body at (4,4)? Yes, (4,4) is occupied). So only UP and DOWN are safe, giving 2 exits. This is less flexible.\n\nRIGHT offers fewer safe exits next turn, making it less desirable.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and apple targeting.**\nI have a strong lead (7 apples vs 3). My priority is to safely collect the bottom apples while avoiding traps. The enemy is on the top-right and unlikely to interfere immediately. Moving DOWN to (2,3) is a direct step toward the closest apple (2,0) and maintains good mobility. Moving LEFT is also safe but less direct. Given the apple density at the bottom, descending is the most efficient path.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** After moving DOWN to (2,3), the nearest apple is (2,0). Consider moving DOWN again to (2,2) or LEFT/RIGHT to approach other apples like (3,0) or (0,0). Keep an eye on the enemy's position\u2014if it moves toward the bottom, I may need to adjust. My body forms a barrier on the right (columns 3-5, rows 4-6), so avoid moving into that area.\n\nDOWN",

Enemy snake #1's head is at (7,7), body at [(6,7), (6,8), (5,8)].\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (2,1).**\n- **UP to (2,2)**: That's my own body (second segment). **Eliminated**.\n- **DOWN to (2,0)**: Contains an apple. Safe (eating is allowed).\n- **LEFT to (1,1)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (3,1)**: Empty. Safe.\n\nSo DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe from self-collision.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1's position and possible moves.**\nEnemy head at (7,7), body at (6,7), (6,8), (5,8). Its safe moves from (7,7):\n- UP to (7,8): Empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (7,6): Empty. Safe.\n- LEFT to (6,7): Its own body. **Eliminated**.\n- RIGHT to (8,7): Empty. Safe.\nIts possible next heads are (7,8), (7,6), (8,7). My possible next heads are (2,0), (1,1), (3,1). No overlap, so no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and eating opportunity.**\nFrom my head (2,1):\n- **DOWN to (2,0)**: Directly onto an apple. This would give me my 8th apple and grow my snake.\n- **LEFT to (1,1)**: Manhattan distances: to (0,0)=1, to (2,0)=2, to (3,0)=3, to (5,0)=5, to (6,0)=6.\n- **RIGHT to (3,1)**: Distances: to (3,0)=1, to (2,0)=2, to (5,0)=3, to (6,0)=4, to (0,0)=4.\n\nDOWN gives an immediate apple capture. LEFT and RIGHT get close to apples but don't eat this turn.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility after each move.**\n- **DOWN to (2,0)**: After eating, my tail stays put, so my body will be: head at (2,0), then (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). Next turn, neck at (2,1). From (2,0), safe moves: LEFT to (1,0), RIGHT to (3,0) (apple). UP to (2,1) is neck. That's 2 safe exits, one of which is an apple.\n- **LEFT to (1,1)**: Next turn, neck at (2,1). From (1,1), safe moves: UP to (1,2), LEFT to (0,1), DOWN to (1,0). RIGHT to (2,1) is neck. That's 3 safe exits.\n- **RIGHT to (3,1)**: Next turn, neck at (2,1). From (3,1), safe moves: UP to (3,2), DOWN to (3,0) (apple), RIGHT to (4,1). LEFT to (2,1) is neck. That's 3 safe exits.\n\nLEFT and RIGHT offer more future mobility (3 exits vs 2), but DOWN gives an immediate apple, extending my lead to 8 vs 3. With a strong lead, securing apples safely is key. The reduced mobility after eating at (2,0) is manageable because I can then go LEFT to (1,0) or RIGHT to (3,0) next turn, both likely safe.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and apple targeting.**\nMy plan from last turn was to move DOWN to (2,1) and then DOWN to (2,0) to eat the apple. That remains optimal. After eating at (2,0), I'll have a long body along column 2. I should then move LEFT toward (0,0) or RIGHT toward (3,0) to continue collecting the bottom-row apples. Moving LEFT to (1,0) might be safer because it keeps distance from my body stack in column 2. The enemy is far away and not an immediate threat.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** After moving DOWN to (2,0) and eating, my head will be at (2,0). From there, assess safety of LEFT to (1,0) and RIGHT to (3,0). Prefer LEFT to collect (0,0) next, as moving RIGHT into (3,0) brings me closer to my body column. Monitor enemy movement\u2014still distant.\n\nDOWN",

Moving LEFT to (5, 6) is the best first step toward this goal.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n1. LEFT to (5, 6)\n2. Continue toward (5, 4) or the bottom apples at (5, 0)/(6, 0)\n3. Avoid the enemy snake's body at (2, 0) through (4, 6)\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Looking at the board, my head is at **(3,0)** after moving RIGHT last turn and eating the apple at (3,0). My body is now: head (3,0), then (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,6). I have 9 apples. Apples remain at (0,0), (6,0), (5,0), (5,4), (4,8). Enemy snake #1 is at head (6,6), body [(7,6), (7,7), (6,7)].\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (3,0).**\n- **UP to (3,1)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN**: Off the board (y would be -1). **Eliminated**.\n- **LEFT to (2,0)**: That's my own body (second segment). **Eliminated**.\n- **RIGHT to (4,0)**: Empty. Safe.\n\nOnly UP and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Step 2: Enemy snake #1's position and possible moves.**\nEnemy head at (6,6). Its safe moves from (6,6):\n- UP to (6,7): Its own body. **Eliminated**.\n- DOWN to (6,5): Empty. Safe.\n- LEFT to (5,6): Empty. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (7,6): Its own body. **Eliminated**.\nIts possible next heads: (6,5), (5,6). My possible next heads: (3,1) or (4,0). No overlap, so no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and eating opportunity.**\n- **UP to (3,1)**: Manhattan distances: to (4,8)=10, to (5,4)=5, to (5,0)=5, to (6,0)=6, to (0,0)=4.\n- **RIGHT to (4,0)**: Manhattan distances: to (5,0)=1, to (6,0)=2, to (0,0)=4, to (5,4)=8, to (4,8)=8.\n\nRIGHT gets me very close to the apples at (5,0) and (6,0) on the bottom row. UP moves me away from the bottom edge and starts a path toward the center and the apple at (5,4).\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility after each move.**\n- **UP to (3,1)**: After moving (no apple eaten), my tail moves. New body: head at (3,1), then (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6). Tail (4,6) disappears. Next turn, neck at (3,0). From (3,1), safe moves: UP to (3,2), LEFT to (2,1) (my body? Let's check: after move, body segments: (3,0), (2,0), (2,1)... so (2,1) is occupied), RIGHT to (4,1), DOWN to (3,0) is neck. So safe moves would be UP and RIGHT. That's 2 safe exits.\n- **RIGHT to (4,0)**: After moving (no apple), tail moves. New body: head at (4,0), then (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6). Tail (4,6) disappears. Next turn, neck at (3,0). From (4,0), safe moves: UP to (4,1), RIGHT to (5,0) (apple). DOWN off-board, LEFT to (3,0) is neck. That's 2 safe exits.\n\nBoth moves yield 2 safe exits next turn. However, RIGHT to (4,0) sets up a direct move onto the apple at (5,0) next turn if I choose RIGHT again. That's a strong immediate gain. UP to (3,1) offers a path toward (5,4) but is less direct.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and apple targeting.**\nMy lead is 9 vs 3. I should continue to eat apples efficiently while maintaining safety. The enemy is still distant. Moving RIGHT to (4,0) positions me to eat (5,0) and then (6,0) quickly, potentially reaching 11 apples. After that, I'll need to navigate upward to avoid the bottom edge and target (5,4) and (4,8). Moving UP now is safer in terms of staying away from the board edge, but the immediate apple gain from the RIGHT path is compelling.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** If I move RIGHT to (4,0), next turn I can move RIGHT to (5,0) to eat the apple, provided it's safe (check enemy and my own body). After that, consider moving UP to (5,1) to avoid the edge and work toward (5,4). Monitor enemy movement\u2014it may move toward the center.\n\nGiven my lead, securing the nearby apples quickly is a good strategy. RIGHT to (4,0) is the move that best positions me for immediate future apple consumption.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples are at (0,0), (6,0), (5,0), (5,4), (4,8). Enemy snake #1's head is at (5,6), body [(6,6), (7,6), (7,7)].\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (4,0).**\n- **UP to (4,1)**: Empty.

My possible next heads are (4,1) or (5,0). No overlap, so no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and eating opportunity.**\n- **UP to (4,1)**: No apple. Distances to apples: (5,4)=4, (4,8)=7, (0,0)=5, (6,0)=6, (5,0)=5.\n- **RIGHT to (5,0)**: Eats the apple. Immediate gain (my apple count goes to 10). After eating, I grow, so my tail stays at (3,6). My new body length will be 11 segments.\n\nEating the apple at (5,0) is a clear advantage, increasing my lead to 10 vs 3.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility after each move.**\n- **UP to (4,1)**: After moving (no apple), my tail moves. New body: head (4,1), then (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). Tail (3,6) disappears. From (4,1), safe moves next turn: UP to (4,2), LEFT to (3,1) (empty?), RIGHT to (5,1) (empty), DOWN to (4,0) is neck. So likely 3 safe exits.\n- **RIGHT to (5,0)**: After moving and eating apple, I grow. New body: head (5,0), then (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6). Tail does NOT disappear. From (5,0), safe moves next turn: UP to (5,1) (empty), RIGHT to (6,0) (apple), DOWN off-board, LEFT to (4,0) is neck. So 2 safe exits (UP and RIGHT). However, RIGHT leads to another apple at (6,0).\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and risk assessment.**\nMoving RIGHT to eat (5,0) is aggressive and continues my plan from last turn. It brings me to the bottom edge, but I will have an immediate opportunity next turn to eat (6,0) if I move RIGHT again. That would give me 11 apples. The enemy is far away and not threatening. The main risk is that after eating (5,0), I am at (5,0) with my long body behind me. Next turn, if I move RIGHT to (6,0) to eat, I must ensure that move is safe (check enemy and my body). From (5,0), UP to (5,1) is also safe and opens a path toward the apple at (5,4).\n\nGiven my significant lead (9 vs 3), securing the two apples on the bottom row quickly is efficient. The enemy is not in a position to intercept. Moving UP to (4,1) is safer in terms of keeping more space, but it delays apple consumption and allows the enemy more time to potentially eat apples like (5,4) or (4,8).\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** If I move RIGHT to (5,0) and eat the apple, next turn I should evaluate moving RIGHT to (6,0) to eat that apple as well, provided it's safe (enemy head will be at one of (5,7), (5,5), or (4,6) \u2013 none threaten (6,0) directly). My own body will not be at (6,0). After that, I must move UP to (6,1) or (5,1) to avoid the bottom edge and start navigating toward the remaining apples. Keep monitoring enemy movement\u2014it may head toward (5,4) or (4,8).\n\nRIGHT to (5,0) is the best move to increase my score and maintain momentum.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples are at (0,0), (6,0), (5,4), (4,8), (9,0). Enemy snake #1's head is at (4,6), body [(5,6), (6,6), (7,6)].\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (5,0).**\n- **UP to (5,1)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN**: Off the board (y = -1). **Eliminated**.\n- **LEFT to (4,0)**: That's my own body (second segment). **Eliminated**.\n- **RIGHT to (6,0)**: Contains an apple. Safe (moving onto an apple is safe; collision checks are with bodies, not apples).\n\nOnly UP and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves from (4,6).**\nIts safe moves from (4,6):\n- UP to (4,7): Empty.\n- DOWN to (4,5): Empty.\n- LEFT to (3,6): That's my tail. **Eliminated** (would die by moving into my body).\n- RIGHT to (5,6): Its own body. **Eliminated**.\nSo its possible next heads are (4,7) or (4,5). My possible next heads are (5,1) or (6,0). No overlap, so no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and eating opportunity.**\n- **UP to (5,1)**: No apple. Distances to apples: (5,4)=3, (4,8)=7, (0,0)=6, (6,0)=5, (9,0)=8.\n- **RIGHT to (6,0)**: Eats the apple. Immediate gain (my apple count goes to 11). After eating, I grow, so my tail stays at (3,6). My new body length will be 12 segments.\n\nEating the apple at (6,0) is a clear advantage, increasing my lead to 11 vs 3.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility after each move.**\n- **UP to (5,1)**: After moving (no apple), my tail moves. New body: head (5,1), then (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). Tail (3,6) disappears. From (5,1), safe moves next turn: UP to (5,2), LEFT to (4,1), RIGHT to (6,1), DOWN to (5,0) is neck. So 3 safe exits.\n- **RIGHT to (6,0)**: After moving and eating apple, I grow. New body: head (6,0), then (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6). Tail does NOT disappear. From (6,0), safe moves next turn: UP to (6,1) (empty), RIGHT to (7,0) (empty), DOWN off-board, LEFT to (5,0) is neck. So 2 safe exits (UP and RIGHT). However, I am on the bottom edge.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and risk assessment.**\nMoving RIGHT to eat (6,0) continues my aggressive apple collection on the bottom row. My lead is huge, and the enemy is far away and not threatening. The main risk is being on the edge with fewer exits. However, next turn from (6,0), I can move UP to (6,1) to regain mobility and start heading toward the apple at (5,4) or (4,8). Moving UP now to (5,1) is safer for future space but delays eating an apple right in front of me. Given my lead, securing the apple is efficient and denies it from the enemy (though they are far). The enemy's possible moves (4,7) or (4,5) do not threaten me.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** If I move RIGHT to (6,0) and eat the apple, next turn I must move UP to (6,1) to avoid the edge and open a path toward the central apples. The enemy may move toward (5,4) or (4,8), so I should plan a route to intercept. My long body is mostly on the left side, so moving up the right side (columns 5-6) seems open.\n\nRIGHT to (6,0) is the best move to increase my score and maintain momentum.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples are at (0,0), (5,4), (4,8), (9,0), (6,9). Enemy snake #1's head is at (4,7), body [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6)].\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (6,0).**\n- **UP to (6,1)**: Empty.

Safe.\n\nSo safe moves are UP and RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves from (4,7).**\nIts safe moves from (4,7):\n- UP to (4,8): Contains an apple.\n- DOWN to (4,6): Its own body. **Eliminated**.\n- LEFT to (3,7): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (5,7): Empty.\nSo its possible next heads are (4,8), (3,7), or (5,7). My possible next heads are (6,1) or (7,0). No overlap, so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and eating opportunity.**\n- **UP to (6,1)**: No apple. Distances to nearest apples: (5,4)=3, (4,8)=7, (6,9)=8.\n- **RIGHT to (7,0)**: No apple. Distances: (9,0)=2, (0,0)=7, (5,4)=5.\n\nNeither move eats an apple this turn. The closest apple is (9,0) from (7,0), but moving RIGHT puts me on a path along the bottom edge toward it. The apple at (5,4) is more central and valuable for future growth, but requires moving upward.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility after each move.**\n- **UP to (6,1)**: After moving, my tail moves (since no apple eaten). New body: head (6,1), then (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). Tail (2,6) disappears, and (3,6) becomes the new tail? Wait, my body list is head-to-tail. After moving without eating, the last segment (tail, (3,6)) is removed, and the new tail becomes (2,6). Let's trace: current body length 12. Move head to (6,1), add it to front, remove last element (3,6). New body: [(6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)]. Yes, tail is (2,6). From (6,1), safe moves next turn: UP to (6,2), LEFT to (5,1), RIGHT to (7,1), DOWN to (6,0) is neck. So 3 safe exits. Good central mobility.\n- **RIGHT to (7,0)**: After moving (no apple), new body: head (7,0), then (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). Tail (3,6) removed. From (7,0), safe moves next turn: UP to (7,1) (empty), RIGHT to (8,0) (empty), DOWN off-board, LEFT to (6,0) is neck. So 2 safe exits (UP and RIGHT). Being on the bottom edge limits options.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and risk assessment.**\nMy lead is 11 apples to 3. The enemy is far away and not an immediate threat. The primary goal is to maintain safety and position myself to collect more apples efficiently. Moving UP to (6,1) gives better future mobility and opens a path toward the central apples (5,4) and (4,8). Moving RIGHT to (7,0) corners me on the bottom edge with fewer exits and only leads toward the apple at (9,0), which is a dead-end path.\n\nThe enemy might move to (4,8) to eat that apple, but that's fine; there are other apples. I should aim for (5,4) next, which is closer from (6,1) than from (7,0).\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** From (6,1), plan to move UP or LEFT toward (5,4). Avoid moving into column 2 where my long body is coiled. Keep an eye on enemy #1's position; it may try to cut me off from central apples, but with its short length, it's less dangerous. Maintain space and avoid trapping myself.\n\nUP",

My possible next heads are (6,2), (5,1), or (7,1). No overlap, so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and eating opportunity.**\n- **UP to (6,2)**: No apple. Distances to nearest apples: (5,4)=2, (6,9)=7, (1,8)=5.\n- **LEFT to (5,1)**: No apple. Distances: (5,4)=3, (1,8)=7, (0,0)=5.\n- **RIGHT to (7,1)**: No apple. Distances: (6,9)=8, (9,0)=8, (5,4)=3.\n\nNo move eats an apple this turn. The closest apple is (5,4), which is 2 steps away from (6,2) (UP then LEFT) and 3 steps away from (5,1) (LEFT then UP/UP/LEFT) and (7,1) (RIGHT then UP/LEFT). Moving UP puts me directly on a path to (5,4) with the shortest Manhattan distance.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility after each move.**\n- **UP to (6,2)**: After moving (no apple), new body: head (6,2), then (6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). Tail (2,6) disappears. From (6,2), safe moves next turn: UP to (6,3), LEFT to (5,2), RIGHT to (7,2), DOWN to (6,1) is neck. So 3 safe exits. Good central mobility, moving toward the middle of the board.\n- **LEFT to (5,1)**: After moving, new body: head (5,1), then (6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). Tail (2,6) disappears. From (5,1), safe moves next turn: UP to (5,2), LEFT to (4,1), DOWN to (5,0) is my body, RIGHT to (6,1) is neck. So 2 safe exits (UP, LEFT). This moves me closer to my coiled body in column 2, slightly limiting space.\n- **RIGHT to (7,1)**: After moving, new body: head (7,1), then (6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). Tail (2,6) disappears. From (7,1), safe moves next turn: UP to (7,2), RIGHT to (8,1), LEFT to (6,1) is neck, DOWN to (7,0) is empty? Wait, (7,0) is empty on the board. Actually, DOWN to (7,0) is empty. Let's check: current board shows (7,0) as '.' and my future body after moving would not include (7,0). So from (7,1), DOWN to (7,0) is safe. That gives 3 safe exits (UP, RIGHT, DOWN). However, moving RIGHT keeps me near the right edge, which could be limiting long-term.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and risk assessment.**\nMy lead is 11 apples to 4. The enemy is far away in the top-left quadrant. The primary goal is to safely collect the central apple at (5,4). Moving UP to (6,2) is the most direct step toward it and maintains excellent mobility. Moving LEFT or RIGHT are less direct and may box me in or delay reaching the apple.\n\nThe enemy might move to (4,9), (3,8), or (5,8). It could be heading for the apple at (1,8) or (6,9). I should secure (5,4) quickly, then consider (6,9) or (1,8) depending on enemy movement.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** From (6,2), plan to move LEFT to (5,2) to get adjacent to the apple at (5,4). Then on the following turn, move UP to (5,3) or LEFT to (4,2) to position to eat it. Keep an eye on enemy #1; if it moves toward (5,4), I may need to block or take an alternative apple. Avoid moving into column 2 where my body is coiled.\n\nUP",

Apples are at (0,0), (5,4), (9,0), (6,9), (1,8). Enemy snake #1's head is at (5,8), body [(4,8), (4,7), (4,6), (5,6)].\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (6,2).**\n- **UP to (6,3)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN to (6,1)**: That's my own body (second segment). **Eliminated**.\n- **LEFT to (5,2)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (7,2)**: Empty. Safe.\n\nSafe moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves from (5,8).**\nIts safe moves from (5,8):\n- UP to (5,9): Empty.\n- DOWN to (5,7): Empty.\n- LEFT to (4,8): Its own body. **Eliminated**.\n- RIGHT to (6,8): Empty.\nSo its possible next heads are (5,9), (5,7), or (6,8). My possible next heads are (6,3), (5,2), or (7,2). No overlap, so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and eating opportunity.**\nThe closest apple is **(5,4)**. From my head:\n- Manhattan distance to (5,4) = |6-5| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3.\nLet's evaluate each move's effect on reaching it:\n- **UP to (6,3)**: New distance to (5,4) = |6-5| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2. Good step.\n- **LEFT to (5,2)**: New distance = |5-5| + |2-4| = 0 + 2 = 2. Also good, and puts me in the same column as the apple.\n- **RIGHT to (7,2)**: New distance = |7-5| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4. Moves me away.\n\nNo move eats an apple this turn. UP and LEFT both reduce the Manhattan distance to (5,4) equally.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility and safety after each move.**\n- **UP to (6,3)**: After moving, new body: head (6,3), then (6,2), (6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Tail (2,5) disappears. From (6,3), safe moves next turn: UP to (6,4), LEFT to (5,3), RIGHT to (7,3), DOWN to (6,2) is neck. So 3 safe exits. Good central mobility.\n- **LEFT to (5,2)**: After moving, new body: head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Tail (2,5) disappears. From (5,2), safe moves next turn: UP to (5,3), LEFT to (4,2), DOWN to (5,1) is empty? Wait, check board: (5,1) is empty. My future body after moving would be (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0), (5,0)... So (5,1) is not occupied. So DOWN to (5,1) is safe. RIGHT to (6,2) is neck. So 3 safe exits (UP, LEFT, DOWN). However, moving LEFT puts me adjacent to my coiled body in column 2, which could limit future maneuvering in that area.\n- **RIGHT to (7,2)**: After moving, new body: head (7,2), then (6,2), (6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Tail (2,5) disappears. From (7,2), safe moves next turn: UP to (7,3), RIGHT to (8,2), LEFT to (6,2) is neck, DOWN to (7,1) is empty. So 3 safe exits (UP, RIGHT, DOWN). This moves me toward the right edge, away from the central apple.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and risk assessment.**\nMy lead is strong (11 vs 4). The enemy is in the top area, possibly heading for apples at (1,8) or (6,9). My priority is to safely collect the central apple at (5,4), which is the most accessible. Moving UP to (6,3) is a direct step toward it while keeping me in a more open central column. Moving LEFT to (5,2) also works, but it places me directly under the apple, which might force a specific path next turn (likely UP to (5,3) then UP to (5,4) to eat). However, being in column 5, row 2 is closer to my coiled body in column 2, which could become a trap if I need to loop around later.\n\nConsidering the [github.com](https://github.com/JeremyHub/Snake-Algorithms) algorithm's principle of keeping the tail in sight and avoiding voids, moving UP seems to maintain better overall board vision and access to the tail (which is currently at (2,4) and will be at (2,5) after this move). The tail is moving upward along column 2, so staying central gives me options to circle back if needed.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** From (6,3), plan to move LEFT to (5,3) to get adjacent to the apple at (5,4). Then on the following turn, move UP to (5,4) to eat it. Monitor enemy #1's movement; if it heads toward (6,9), I might pivot to that apple after securing (5,4). Avoid moving into column 2 where my body is coiled.\n\nUP",

Good step.\n- **LEFT to (5,3)**: New distance = |5-5| + |3-4| = 0 + 1 = 1. Also good, and puts me directly under the apple.\n- **RIGHT to (7,3)**: New distance = |7-5| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3. Moves me away.\n\nNo move eats an apple this turn. UP and LEFT both reduce the Manhattan distance to (5,4) equally.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility and safety after each move.**\n- **UP to (6,4)**: After moving, new body: head (6,4), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). Tail (2,4) disappears. From (6,4), safe moves next turn: UP to (6,5), LEFT to (5,4) (apple!), RIGHT to (7,4), DOWN to (6,3) is neck. So 3 safe exits, with one leading directly to the apple. Excellent.\n- **LEFT to (5,3)**: After moving, new body: head (5,3), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). Tail (2,4) disappears. From (5,3), safe moves next turn: UP to (5,4) (apple!), LEFT to (4,3), DOWN to (5,2), RIGHT to (6,3) is neck. So 3 safe exits, with one leading directly to the apple. Also excellent.\n- **RIGHT to (7,3)**: After moving, new body: head (7,3), then (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). Tail (2,4) disappears. From (7,3), safe moves next turn: UP to (7,4), RIGHT to (8,3), LEFT to (6,3) is neck, DOWN to (7,2) is empty. So 3 safe exits, but moves me away from the central apple cluster.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and risk assessment.**\nMy lead is strong (11 vs 4). The enemy is near the apple at (6,9) and may eat it. My priority is to safely collect the central apple at (5,4). Both UP and LEFT set me up to eat it next turn. However, I must consider the enemy's potential move to (6,9). If it eats that apple, it will grow, but that's not an immediate threat.\n\nChoosing **LEFT to (5,3)** puts me directly under the apple, guaranteeing I can eat it next turn by moving UP, provided that cell remains safe. However, from (5,3), my only path to the apple is UP, which could be risky if the enemy somehow interferes (unlikely given its distance). Choosing **UP to (6,4)** also sets me up to eat next turn by moving LEFT to (5,4). Both are equally good in terms of steps to the apple.\n\nLooking at future mobility after eating the apple: If I go LEFT now to (5,3) and then UP to (5,4) to eat, my new head will be at (5,4) with a longer body. From there, I could consider moving towards other apples like (6,9) or (1,8), but I'll be near my coiled body in column 2. If I go UP now to (6,4) and then LEFT to (5,4) to eat, I'll end up at the same spot (5,4) but from a slightly different path. The difference is minimal.\n\nI'll choose **LEFT** because it directly aligns my head under the apple, making the next move straightforward and reducing any chance of an unexpected obstacle appearing in column 6. It also keeps me closer to the left side where my tail is moving, potentially allowing for a loop.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:** From (5,3), plan to move UP to (5,4) to eat the apple. After eating, assess safety: the new tail will be at (2,3). Consider moving towards the apple at (6,9) or (1,8) next, but avoid getting boxed in by my own body in column 2. Monitor enemy #1's position; if it ate (6,9), it may be longer and more dangerous.\n\nLEFT",

Apples are at (0,0), (5,4), (9,0), (6,9), (1,8). Enemy snake #1's head is at (7,8), body [(6,8), (5,8), (4,8), (4,7)].\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (5,3).**\n- **UP to (5,4)**: Contains an apple. Safe (eating is allowed).\n- **DOWN to (5,2)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (4,3)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (6,3)**: That's my own body (second segment). **Eliminated**.\n\nSafe moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves from (7,8).**\nIts safe moves from (7,8):\n- UP to (7,9): Empty.\n- DOWN to (7,7): Empty.\n- LEFT to (6,8): Its own body. **Eliminated**.\n- RIGHT to (8,8): Empty.\nSo its possible next heads are (7,9), (7,7), or (8,8). My possible next heads are (5,4), (5,2), or (4,3). No overlap, so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and eating opportunity.**\nThe apple at **(5,4)** is directly above me. Moving **UP** eats it immediately, giving me a point and growing my length. This is the most direct way to increase my lead (12 vs 4). The other apples are much farther.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility and safety after each move.**\n- **UP to (5,4)**: After eating, my new head is at (5,4), and my body grows by 1. The new body will be: head (5,4), then (5,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). The tail remains at (2,3) for now. From (5,4), safe moves next turn: UP to (5,5), LEFT to (4,4), RIGHT to (6,4), DOWN to (5,3) is neck. So 3 safe exits. Good mobility.\n- **DOWN to (5,2)**: Moves away from the nearest apple. From (5,2), safe moves next turn: UP to (5,3) is neck, DOWN to (5,1), LEFT to (4,2), RIGHT to (6,2) is my body. So only 2 safe exits (DOWN, LEFT). This reduces future options and doesn't progress towards an apple.\n- **LEFT to (4,3)**: Also moves away from the apple at (5,4). From (4,3), safe moves next turn: UP to (4,4), DOWN to (4,2), LEFT to (3,3), RIGHT to (5,3) is neck. So 3 safe exits. However, it delays eating.\n\n**Step 5: Risk assessment.**\nEating the apple is safe. The enemy is far away and cannot interfere this turn. There is no risk of moving into its path. My own body does not occupy (5,4). The only minor consideration is that after eating, my body will occupy more space, but I will still have good mobility from (5,4). Not eating the apple now gives the enemy more time to catch up, and I might miss the opportunity if the enemy somehow moves into the area later.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**\nAfter moving UP to eat the apple at (5,4), my head will be at (5,4). From there, assess the safest path towards another apple, likely (6,9) or (1,8). The apple at (6,9) is closer (Manhattan distance 5 vs 7 to (1,8)), but the enemy is near it. A safer medium-term target might be the apple at (1,8), though it requires navigating through my own body coils in columns 2-3. Plan a route that avoids boxing myself in and maintains at least 2 safe exits each turn. Monitor enemy #1's growth if it eats (6,9).\n\nUP is the clear best move: it safely collects an apple, extends my lead, and maintains good future mobility.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n\nSafe moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves from (7,9).**\nIts safe moves from (7,9):\n- UP to (7,?): Off board (y=10). **Eliminated**.\n- DOWN to (7,8): Its own body. **Eliminated**.\n- LEFT to (6,9): Contains an apple at (6,9). Safe (eating allowed).\n- RIGHT to (8,9): Empty. Safe.\nSo its possible next heads are (6,9) or (8,9). My possible next heads are (5,5), (4,4), (6,4). No overlap, so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and eating opportunity.**\nThe closest apples are:\n- (7,1): Manhattan distance |5-7|+|4-1| = 2+3=5.\n- (1,8): |5-1|+|4-8| = 4+4=8.\n- (6,9): |5-6|+|4-9| = 1+5=6.\n- (0,0) and (9,0) are farther (9 and 8 respectively).\n\nThe apple at (7,1) is the closest. To reach it, I need to move RIGHT (to (6,4)) or DOWN (blocked) or LEFT/UP to eventually loop around. Moving RIGHT gets me closer in x-coordinate. Moving UP or LEFT increases the distance slightly.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility and safety after each move.**\n- **UP to (5,5)**: From (5,5), safe moves next turn: UP to (5,6), LEFT to (4,5), RIGHT to (6,5), DOWN to (5,4) is neck. So 3 safe exits. However, it moves me away from the closest apple (7,1).\n- **LEFT to (4,4)**: From (4,4), safe moves next turn: UP to (4,5), DOWN to (4,3), LEFT to (3,4), RIGHT to (5,4) is neck. So 3 safe exits. Moves me slightly left, away from (7,1).\n- **RIGHT to (6,4)**: From (6,4), safe moves next turn: UP to (6,5), DOWN to (6,3) is my body, LEFT to (5,4) is neck, RIGHT to (7,4). So only 2 safe exits (UP, RIGHT). However, this moves me directly toward (7,1) in x-direction and sets up a potential path down the right side. The reduced exits are a concern, but from (6,4) I can go RIGHT to (7,4) next, then DOWN toward the apple.\n\n**Step 5: Risk assessment and enemy consideration.**\nThe enemy is at (7,9) and likely will eat the apple at (6,9) by moving LEFT, growing to length 5. It will then be closer to the apple at (1,8) or may come down. I have a significant lead (12 vs 4). My priority should be to safely collect more apples while avoiding being trapped. Moving RIGHT toward (7,1) is appealing, but I must ensure I don't box myself in. From (6,4), my only safe moves next turn are UP or RIGHT. If I go RIGHT to (7,4), I then have more options (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) to approach (7,1). This seems viable.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP or LEFT maintains more immediate flexibility but delays eating. Given my lead, I could play more conservatively to avoid risk. However, the board is relatively open, and the enemy is far away in the top rows. Moving RIGHT seems safe from collision and starts me toward an apple.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (6,4), my head will be at (6,4). Next turn, likely move RIGHT to (7,4) to continue toward the apple at (7,1) while checking safety. Be aware that my body occupies (6,3) and (6,2) below, so moving DOWN from (6,4) is blocked. Keep an eye on enemy #1's position after it likely eats (6,9). It may head toward (1,8) or come down the left side. I should aim to collect (7,1), then consider (9,0) or (0,0) while avoiding getting encircled by my own long body.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples are at (0,0), (9,0), (6,9), (1,8), (7,1). Enemy snake #1's head is at (8,9), body [(7,9), (7,8), (6,8), (5,8)].\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (6,4).**\n- **UP to (6,5)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN to (6,3)**: That's my own body (third segment). **Eliminated**.\n- **LEFT to (5,4)**: That's my own body (first segment behind head). **Eliminated**.\n- **RIGHT to (7,4)**: Empty. Safe.\n\nOnly safe moves are UP and RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves from (8,9).**\nIts safe moves from (8,9):\n- UP to (8,10): Off board (y=10). **Eliminated**.\n- DOWN to (8,8): Empty. Safe.\n- LEFT to (7,9): Its own body. **Eliminated**.\n- RIGHT to (9,9): Empty. Safe.\nSo its possible next heads are (8,8) or (9,9). My possible next heads are (6,5) or (7,4). No overlap, so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and eating opportunity.**\nThe closest apples are:\n- (7,1): Manhattan distance |6-7|+|4-1| = 1+3=4.\n- (6,9): |6-6|+|4-9| = 0+5=5.\n- (1,8): |6-1|+|4-8| = 5+4=9.\n- (0,0) and (9,0) are farther.\n\nThe apple at (7,1) is the closest. To reach it, I need to move RIGHT (to (7,4)) to get closer in x-coordinate, then eventually DOWN. Moving UP to (6,5) moves me away from it.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility and safety after each move.**\n- **UP to (6,5)**: From (6,5), safe moves next turn: UP to (6,6), LEFT to (5,5), RIGHT to (7,5), DOWN to (6,4) is neck. So 3 safe exits. However, it moves me away from the closest apple (7,1) and toward the top where the enemy is.\n- **RIGHT to (7,4)**: From (7,4), safe moves next turn: UP to (7,5), DOWN to (7,3), RIGHT to (8,4), LEFT to (6,4) is neck. So 3 safe exits. This moves me directly toward (7,1) in x-direction and sets up a clear path: next turn I could go DOWN to (7,3), then (7,2), then (7,1) to eat the apple, provided those cells remain clear.\n\n**Step 5: Risk assessment and enemy consideration.**\nThe enemy is at (8,9) and will likely move DOWN to (8,8) or RIGHT to (9,9). It is far from me and from the apple at (7,1). I have a significant lead (12 apples vs 4). My priority is to safely collect the nearest apple while maintaining mobility. Moving RIGHT to (7,4) gives me good options and progresses toward (7,1). Moving UP is safe but delays eating and brings me closer to the enemy's territory near the top apples (6,9) and (1,8), which could lead to a confrontation I don't need given my lead.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (7,4), my head will be at (7,4). Next turn, I should move DOWN to (7,3) to continue toward the apple at (7,1), provided it's safe (check for my body and enemy positions). Be aware that my body occupies (6,3) to the left of (7,3), so that cell is blocked, but (7,3) itself is currently empty. The path (7,4) -> (7,3) -> (7,2) -> (7,1) looks clear. Keep monitoring enemy #1's movement; it may head for the apple at (6,9) or (1,8). With my lead, I can afford to secure the closest apple and avoid unnecessary risks.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples are at (0,0), (9,0), (6,9), (1,8), (7,1). Enemy snake #1's head is at (9,8), body [(8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (7,8)].\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (7,3).**\n- **UP to (7,4)**: That's my own body (first segment behind head). **Eliminated**.\n- **DOWN to (7,2)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (6,3)**: That's my own body. **Eliminated**.\n- **RIGHT to (8,3)**: Empty. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake #1's possible moves from (9,8).**\nIts safe moves from (9,8):\n- UP to (9,9): Empty. Safe.\n- DOWN to (9,7): Empty. Safe.\n- LEFT to (8,8): Its own body. **Eliminated**.\n- RIGHT: Off board (x=10). **Eliminated**.\nSo its possible next heads are (9,9) or (9,7). My possible next heads are (7,2) or (8,3). No overlap, so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and eating opportunity.**\nThe closest apple is at **(7,1)**, Manhattan distance |7-7|+|3-1| = 0+2 = 2.\nTo reach it, I need to move DOWN. Moving DOWN to (7,2) directly progresses toward it. Moving RIGHT moves sideways.\nOther apples: (6,9) is far, (1,8) far, (0,0) and (9,0) far.\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility and safety after each move.**\n- **DOWN to (7,2)**: From (7,2), safe moves next turn: UP to (7,3) is neck, DOWN to (7,1) is the apple, LEFT to (6,2) is my body, RIGHT to (8,2). So 2 safe exits (DOWN to apple, RIGHT). Moving DOWN to (7,1) next turn would eat the apple and grow, which is good. The path is clear.\n- **RIGHT to (8,3)**: From (8,3), safe moves next turn: UP to (8,4), DOWN to (8,2), LEFT to (7,3) is neck, RIGHT to (9,3). So 3 safe exits. Moves away from the nearest apple.\n\n**Step 5: Risk assessment and enemy consideration.**\nEnemy is at (9,8) and will likely move UP to (9,9) or DOWN to (9,7). It is far from me and from the apple at (7,1). I have a large lead (12 apples vs 4). My priority is to safely collect the nearest apple while avoiding traps. Moving DOWN to (7,2) is the most direct route to the apple, and next turn I can move DOWN again to (7,1) to eat it, provided it remains safe. The enemy is not a threat to this path.\n\nGiven my lead, securing the apple quickly is beneficial. Moving RIGHT gives more options but delays eating. The apple at (7,1) is very close, and eating it will extend my lead and increase my length, which can be advantageous for controlling space. The [github.com](https://github.com/JeremyHub/Snake-Algorithms) algorithm emphasizes keeping the tail in sight to avoid death; here, my tail is at (2,0), and moving DOWN keeps it accessible via a path along the bottom and left.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (7,2), my head will be at (7,2). Next turn, I should move DOWN to (7,1) to eat the apple, provided it's safe (check for my body and enemy positions). The cell (7,1) is currently an apple. Be aware that my body occupies (6,1) to the left, but that's fine. If DOWN becomes unsafe next turn (e.g., enemy somehow moves there), I could go RIGHT to (8,2) as an escape. The key is to secure the apple at (7,1) to extend my lead to 13 apples.\n\nDOWN",

This would kill me.\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (10, 8)**: Off the board. This would kill me.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\nUP is my only safe move. From (9, 9):\n- I can continue moving UP along the right edge\n- I can eventually work my way toward apples at (9, 0) or (6, 9)\n- The right edge keeps me away from Snake #0's body cluster in the center\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter moving UP to (9, 9), I'll have better options. I can navigate toward the apple at (9, 0) by working my way down the right edge, or possibly head toward (6, 9) if that route becomes safer.\n\nUP",

However, I must still make a legal move this turn. Since the enemy will die regardless, my primary goal is to survive this turn and secure victory.\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and eating opportunity.**\nThe closest apple is at **(7,1)**, Manhattan distance 1. Moving DOWN directly eats it, increasing my score to 13 apples and growing my length. Moving RIGHT to (8,2) avoids the apple but keeps me alive. Given the enemy's imminent death, eating the apple is safe and beneficial for any future tie-breakers (though victory should be immediate after this turn).\n\n**Step 4: Future mobility and safety after each move.**\n- **DOWN to (7,1)**: Eating apple. From (7,1), next turn's safe moves would need assessment, but since the enemy will be dead, I only need to avoid my own body. My new tail position will depend on growth; typically, the tail stays put for one turn after eating. My current tail is at (3,0). The area around (7,1) has my body at (6,1) and (6,2), but UP to (7,2) will be my neck, LEFT to (6,1) is body, RIGHT to (8,1) is empty, DOWN to (7,0) is empty. So likely 2 safe exits next turn.\n- **RIGHT to (8,2)**: From (8,2), safe moves next turn: UP to (8,3), DOWN to (8,1), LEFT to (7,2) is neck, RIGHT to (9,2). So 3 safe exits. However, this delays eating.\n\n**Step 5: Decision and long-term plan.**\nSince enemy snake #1 has no legal moves and will die, my move this turn only needs to keep me alive to claim victory. Both DOWN and RIGHT are safe. Eating the apple at (7,1) is advantageous\u2014it increases my score and length with no risk from the enemy. The [github.com](https://github.com/JeremyHub/Snake-Algorithms) algorithm prioritizes keeping the tail in sight; my tail is at (3,0), and moving DOWN keeps a path open along the bottom edge.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving DOWN and eating the apple, the game should end because the opponent is dead. If for any reason the game continues, I will assess from (7,1) and avoid my own body. My immediate goal is secured.\n\nDOWN",

This appears to be a completely trapped position.\n\nHowever, I need to reconsider the board visualization. Looking at the original board:\n\n```\n 9 . . . . . . A T T 1\n 8 . A . . . . . . T T\n```\n\nIf my head is at (9, 9), and there's an apple 'A' at (6, 9), and 'T' segments at (7, 9) and (8, 9), then my body would include (7, 9) and (8, 9). This means:\n- (8, 9) is my body \u2192 LEFT would be suicide\n- (9, 8) is my body \u2192 DOWN would be suicide\n\nLet me re-examine the board more carefully. There might be a different interpretation.\n\nActually, reviewing the full board, I notice the snake #0 has body segments at various positions. Let me reconsider what cells are actually occupied.\n\nLooking at the board again, I see 'T' symbols (representing Snake #0's body) at positions including:\n- Row 9: (7, 9), (8, 9)\n- Row 8: (8, 8), (9, 8) \n- Row 2: (7, 2) is Snake #0's head\n- And other positions\n\nIf my body is at [(9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 9), (7, 9)], then:\n- (9, 8) and (8, 8) are marked 'T' on the board\n- (8, 9) and (7, 9) are also marked 'T' on the board\n\nThis doesn't match. Let me look at the snake description again - it says these are MY body segments, not Snake #0's.\n\nActually, I think the 'T' markers on the board might represent all snake bodies, not just enemy snakes. So my body segments would also show as 'T'.\n\nGiven this interpretation and my current trapped position where all four directions lead to death, I need to assess the situation differently.\n\nSince UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT all lead to immediate death, I should look at the spirit of the rules. The rules state that moving backwards into your own body kills you, but also say to avoid obvious death. \n\nLet me reconsider - perhaps the board has a different configuration than I'm reading. The most conservative approach is to try to find ANY valid move.\n\nGiven the trapped situation, I'll go with UP as my move, attempting to continue the momentum from my previous move.\n\nUP",
