I can reach it in 2 moves: LEFT to (3, 6), then DOWN to (3, 5).\n\nMoving LEFT gets me closer to that apple while keeping multiple future options open. The enemy snake at (2, 3) is far enough away that there's no immediate collision risk.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 1: Move LEFT to get closer to apple at (3, 5)\n- Turn 2: Move DOWN to collect apple at (3, 5)\n- After that, reassess board and head toward other nearby apples like (4, 3) or (1, 6)\n\nLEFT",

The apple at (4, 3) is very close - just 2 moves to the right on the same row. This seems like the quickest apple to grab.\n2. Moving RIGHT toward (4, 3) keeps me in the middle of the board with good options.\n3. The enemy at (4, 6) is 3 rows above me, so we're unlikely to collide soon.\n\n**Best path:**\nGoing RIGHT twice would get me to (4, 3) for an apple.

The apple at (3, 9) is directly above me (4 moves up). The apple at (4, 3) is nearby (1 right, 2 down). Consider moving toward (4, 3) or continuing up toward (3, 9).

This is efficient.\n3. **RIGHT (6, 2)**: Safe, moves toward (8, 2) apple and the apple-rich right side.\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nSnake #1 at (1, 5) with body at (2, 5) - it's moving left. Likely going for (1, 6) which is just 1 up, or (0, 1) below. It's far from me, no collision risk this turn.\n\n**Strategic thinking:**\n- DOWN to (5, 1) puts me one move away from (5, 0) apple\n- Then I can grab (6, 0) which is adjacent\n- After that, I can sweep right toward (9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 2), (9, 3)\n\nAlternatively:\n- RIGHT to (6, 2) heads toward (8, 2) which is 2 more moves right\n- But DOWN gets me an apple faster (2 moves vs 3 moves)\n\n**Decision:**\nDOWN is the most efficient path - it gets me to (5, 0) in just one more turn. Then I can collect (6, 0) right after. This builds my length quickly while the enemy is on the other side of the board.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- This turn: DOWN to (5, 1)\n- Next turn: DOWN to (5, 0) - collect apple!\n- Then: RIGHT to (6, 0) - collect another apple!\n- Continue right along bottom: (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0) - collect apple!\n- Then up: (9, 1) - another apple!\n- Continue harvesting the right side apples\n\nDOWN",

It collects an apple immediately (+1 score, now 3 total)\n2. It positions me well to continue collecting apples in the left/upper region\n3. The left edge has good apple density with (1, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8) nearby\n4. Enemy snake is far away at (5, 1)\n\n**Future Plan:**\nAfter collecting the apple at (0, 6), continue moving UP the left edge to collect (1, 8) and (2, 8). The left side has a good cluster of apples.

RIGHT is clearly superior because:\n- It collects an apple at (2, 8), extending my lead to 5-3\n- This continues the strategy of working along the top row where multiple apples are clustered: (2, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (9, 8)\n- The enemy is still far away at (8, 0), nowhere near my path\n- Collecting apples consistently is the winning strategy\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\nContinue RIGHT to gobble up the apple cluster at the top (y=8). After (2, 8), move to (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8) and eventually (9, 8). Then move down the right side toward (9, 6), (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0).

It's likely going for apples at (2, 8) or (3, 9). The enemy is not a threat to me as we're on opposite sides of the board.\n\n**Strategic thinking:**\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 0):\n- I get an apple immediately! Score becomes 4.\n- From (9, 0), I can ONLY go UP (to 9, 1) next turn for another apple!\n- Wait, let me check: from (9, 0), LEFT would be (8, 0) which will be my body, DOWN is off board, RIGHT is off board. Only UP is valid.\n- UP to (9, 1) gets another apple!\n- Then from (9, 1): UP to (9, 2) or LEFT to (8, 1)\n- Can continue up: (9, 2), (9, 3) for apple, etc.\n\nIf I go UP to (8, 1):\n- Empty space, safe\n- Delays getting the apple at (9, 0)\n- More flexibility but less efficient\n\n**Risk check for RIGHT:**\n- Going to (9, 0): This puts me in the corner\n- From (9, 0), my only move is UP to (9, 1) - which has an apple!\n- My tail will follow, so (5, 0) becomes free, (6, 0) becomes tail\n- After eating apple at (9, 0), my body will be: (9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0)\n- From (9, 0), going UP to (9, 1) eats another apple\n- This is still safe - I'm creating a path along the right edge with lots of apples\n\n**Path along right edge:**\n- (9, 0) apple\n- (9, 1) apple  \n- (9, 2) empty\n- (9, 3) apple\n- Continue up to (9, 6), (9, 8) more apples\n\nThis is an excellent path! The right edge has many apples and the enemy is on the opposite side.\n\n**Decision:**\nRIGHT is the best choice - gets an immediate apple, continues toward the rich apple cluster on the right side of the board.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 10: UP to (9, 1) for apple\n- Turn 11: UP to (9, 2)\n- Turn 12: UP to (9, 3) for apple\n- Continue up the right edge collecting apples\n\nRIGHT",

This will:\n- Break the 5-5 tie and give me a 6-5 lead\n- Position me well for continuing to collect apples along the top row\n- Keep me on the high-value apple corridor\n\nThe enemy at (9, 1) is moving away from the main apple cluster at y=8, so I have good positioning to collect more apples in subsequent turns.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**\nAfter eating at (3, 9), continue moving RIGHT along the top edge to collect the remaining apples at (6, 8), (7, 8), and (9, 8). The enemy is positioned at the bottom and should not interfere. After the top row is cleared, navigate down the right side toward remaining apples. Build my lead as much as possible while the enemy is far away.\n\nUP",

From (9, 2), I can go UP to (9, 3) for an apple or LEFT to (8, 2) for an apple\n3. It maintains my strategic position on the right side\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 12: Go UP to (9, 3) to get apple, OR LEFT to (8, 2) to get apple\n- Continue collecting apples along the right edge and upper right corner\n- Stay away from enemy who is in the top-left area\n\nUP",

The major apple cluster is in the middle to upper-right area:\n- Upper region: (6, 8), (7, 8), (9, 8), (5, 7)\n- Middle region: (5, 5), (3, 5), (6, 4), (7, 3), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6)\n\nMoving DOWN allows me to:\n1. Navigate downward to reach the dense apple cluster more efficiently\n2. Keep maximum flexibility for approaching apples from the center\n3. Avoid getting trapped along the top edge with limited movement options\n\nMoving RIGHT would just keep me along an edge with fewer apple options below me.\n\n**Next few turns plan:** Move DOWN, then navigate toward the apple clusters in the middle-right area (around coordinates 5-8 in y, 5-9 in x). Prioritize efficient pathing to maximize apple collection while staying away from the enemy snake which is on the right edge.\n\nDOWN",

They're far from my position.\n\n**Strategic consideration:**\nLEFT seems better because:\n1. It gives immediate access to TWO apples nearby: (7, 3) and (8, 2)\n2. It opens up more space rather than staying cornered on the right edge\n3. After collecting (7, 3) and (8, 2), I can still sweep up to the right side apples\n\nGoing UP keeps me on the edge with limited options, and I'd have to go up 2-3 spaces before reaching the next apple at (9, 6).\n\n**Decision:**\nLEFT to move toward the cluster of apples at (7, 3) and (8, 2), then work my way through the middle of the board.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 14: From (8, 3), go LEFT to (7, 3) for apple\n- Turn 15: Go DOWN to (7, 2) or UP to (7, 4)\n- Then sweep toward (6, 4), (8, 2) and eventually back to the right-side apples at (8, 6), (7, 6), (9, 6)\n\nLEFT",

The enemy snake is at (7, 3) in the middle-right area.\n\n**Available Moves from (5, 8):**\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (5, 9):\n   - Not off board \u2713\n   - Not into my body \u2713\n   - No apple at (5, 9) \u2713\n   - Safe from enemy \u2713\n   - Moves me to the top edge\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (5, 7):\n   - Not off board \u2713\n   - Not into my body \u2713\n   - **Apple at (5, 7)** \u2713 **GAIN 1 POINT!**\n   - Safe from enemy \u2713\n   - Excellent move - grows snake and moves toward apple cluster\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (4, 8):\n   - This is where my body is (second segment) \u274c **DEATH** - Can't move backwards into body\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 8):\n   - Not off board \u2713\n   - Not into my body \u2713\n   - No apple at (6, 8) \u2713\n   - Safe from enemy \u2713\n   - Moves toward right side apples\n\n**Strategic Assessment:**\nDOWN is clearly the best move because:\n1. There's an apple at (5, 7) - I gain 1 point and tie the score with the enemy (both at 7)\n2. It positions me well to continue toward the cluster of apples in the (5-9, 6-8) region\n3.

After eating this apple, I'll be at (5, 7) with multiple nearby targets: (6, 8), (7, 8), (5, 5), (6, 4)\n\n**Long-term Plan for next turns:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (5, 7) and collecting the apple, continue moving RIGHT to access the rich apple cluster at (6-9, 6-8). Be mindful of the enemy snake which is currently at (7, 3) and will likely move toward the center or right side. Maintain awareness of escape routes and avoid getting cornered in the upper-right area.\n\nDOWN",

They might go for (5, 7), (6, 8), or (7, 8) apples. They're positioned in the top cluster.\n\n**Strategic thinking:**\n- UP to (7, 4) puts me one move from (6, 4) apple\n- LEFT to (6, 3) also puts me one move from (6, 4) apple\n- Both are good options\n\nLet me think about follow-up moves:\n- If I go UP to (7, 4): Next turn LEFT to (6, 4) for apple!\n- If I go LEFT to (6, 3): Next turn UP to (6, 4) for apple!\n\nBoth get me to the same apple. But going UP first:\n- From (7, 4), I have: UP (7, 5), DOWN (7, 3 - my body?), LEFT (6, 4 - APPLE!), RIGHT (8, 4)\n- Actually (7, 3) will still have my body since I'm growing\n\nGoing LEFT first:\n- From (6, 3), I have: UP (6, 4 - APPLE!), DOWN (6, 2), LEFT (5, 3), RIGHT (7, 3 - my body)\n\nBoth seem similar. Let me go UP to (7, 4) as it moves toward the richer apple cluster in the upper area (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 7).\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 15: Go UP to (7, 4)\n- Turn 16: Go LEFT to (6, 4) for apple\n- Turn 17: Continue toward (5, 5) or up to (7, 6) area\n- Watch out for enemy snake which is in the top cluster\n\nUP",

Looking at nearby apples:\n- (5, 5): 2 cells below\n- (6, 8): 1 cell up-right\n- (7, 8): 2 cells up-right\n- (3, 5): to the left\n- (6, 4): down-right\n- (0, 5): far left\n- (0, 7): same row, far left\n- (9, 6), (9, 8), (8, 6), (8, 2): right side\n\n**Evaluating safe moves:**\n\n- **DOWN**: Moves toward (5, 5) apple which is accessible. Good progression toward the apple cluster in the (5-9, 4-8) region.\n\n- **LEFT**: Moves away from immediate apples and toward the edge. Less strategic.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Moves toward the right-side apples (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 8). But the enemy at (7, 4) is also on the right side. Moving right could put me in competition with the enemy for that region.\n\n**Best move:** DOWN is the safest strategic choice because:\n1. It moves toward the (5, 5) apple which is clearly accessible\n2. It keeps me in the center-upper area where I have flexibility\n3. The enemy is at (7, 4) moving down/right area - moving down/left initially reduces collision risk\n4. After eating (5, 5), I can pivot to access other nearby apples\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove DOWN to approach (5, 5). Collect it on the next turn if possible. Then reassess the enemy position and decide whether to push right toward the (6-9, 6-8) apple cluster or continue in the center.

I need to catch up.\n\nNearby apples from (5, 6):\n- (5, 5): 1 cell DOWN - **IMMEDIATE APPLE!**\n- (3, 5): 2 left, 1 down\n- (6, 8): 1 right, 2 up\n- (7, 6): 2 right, same row\n- (9, 6): 4 right, same row\n- (7, 8): 2 right, 2 up\n- (8, 6): 3 right, same row\n\n**Evaluating safe moves:**\n\n- **DOWN**: Moves directly to (5, 5) which has an apple! This would:\n  - Tie the score at 8-8\n  - Keep me competitive\n  - After eating, I'd be at (5, 5) with good access to other apples like (3, 5), (6, 2), etc.\n  - Strong offensive move\n\n- **LEFT**: Moves away from the (5, 5) apple and toward the edge. The enemy could take (5, 5) or other apples on their turn.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Also moves away from the (5, 5) apple. The enemy at (6, 4) is moving toward the right side. Could lead to collision risks and ceding the (5, 5) apple.\n\n**Best move:** DOWN is clearly the best choice because:\n1. It guarantees collecting the (5, 5) apple this turn, tying the score\n2. It keeps me competitive in the race to 30 apples\n3. From (5, 5), I'll have good options to reach (3, 5) or other nearby apples\n4. It's an aggressive move that doesn't compromise future flexibility\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**\nAfter eating (5, 5), reassess from that position. The apples at (3, 5) and (3, 3) are nearby. The right-side apples (7, 8), (8, 6), (9, 6) are also reachable. Monitor enemy position at (6, 4) - if they move toward the right-side cluster, consider moving left/down toward (3, 5) and (3, 3) to avoid direct competition. Keep building lead after tying.\n\nDOWN",

This means I should NOT go to (5, 5) next turn expecting it to be there.\n\n**Analyzing each option:**\n\n**UP (6, 5):**\n- Empty space, safe\n- Close to (5, 5) but enemy might take it\n- Could then go toward (7, 6), (8, 6) cluster\n- Enemy might go RIGHT to (6, 6) - if I go UP to (6, 5) and they go RIGHT to (6, 6), no collision\n\n**DOWN (6, 3):**\n- Empty space, safe\n- Gets closer to (6, 2) apple\n- Also near (3, 3) apple\n- Moves away from enemy competition\n\n**LEFT (5, 4):**\n- Empty space, safe\n- Gets closer to (5, 5) apple but enemy might beat me there\n- If enemy goes DOWN to (5, 5) and I go LEFT to (5, 4), we don't collide, but they get the apple\n\n**Strategic thinking:**\nThe enemy is likely heading DOWN to grab (5, 5). If I go UP to (6, 5), I'm in a good position to:\n1. Potentially contest the upper right cluster (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6)\n2. Keep options open\n3. If enemy goes elsewhere, I can still grab (5, 5) next turn\n\nGoing DOWN toward (6, 2) is also good - less contested apples.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: UP to (6, 5) puts me adjacent to (5, 5). If enemy goes DOWN to (5, 5), we won't collide. Then I could go LEFT to (5, 5) next turn... wait, if they eat the apple they'll still be there.\n\nI think UP is the safest move that keeps me in apple-rich territory. From (6, 5) I can go toward the (7, 6), (8, 6) cluster next turn.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 17: Go UP to (6, 5)\n- Turn 18: Go RIGHT to (7, 5), then UP to (7, 6) for apple\n- Watch enemy - they'll likely grab (5, 5) and grow\n\nUP",

This gives me a 9-8 lead and keeps me aggressive.\n\n**Next turn plan:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (3, 5) and eating the apple, my head will be at (3, 5) and I'll have 9 apples. The enemy is moving around (6, 6). From (3, 5), I should look to either:\n1. Continue left toward (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8) apple cluster if space allows\n2. Go DOWN to (3, 4) or (3, 3) to grab the apple at (3, 3)\n3. Reassess based on enemy position and remaining board space\n\nThe key is maintaining my lead while avoiding traps.\n\nLEFT",

I'm in the left-center area with good access to the lower-left apple cluster.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n\n- **UP \u2192 (3, 6):** Moves toward the upper area away from nearby apples. The apple at (3, 3) is down, not up. This wastes a turn moving away from my nearest target.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (2, 5):** Continues left but doesn't advance toward the apple at (3, 3). This move goes parallel/away from my target.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (3, 4):** This moves me directly closer to the apple at (3, 3), which is my nearest uncollected apple. From (3, 4), I can easily reach (3, 3) next turn. This is the most efficient path to extend my lead.\n\n**Strategic Plan for next few turns:**\n1. Move DOWN to (3, 4)\n2. Move DOWN again to (3, 3) to grab the apple - this puts me at 10 apples vs enemy's 9\n3. Continue left to grab more apples in that region: (1, 2), (0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 7), (0, 8)\n4.

(+1 point)\n- From (8, 6) I could continue to (9, 6) for another apple next turn\n- Then go UP to (9, 7), (9, 8) - more apples!\n- This continues my plan from last turn perfectly\n\n**UP (7, 7):**\n- Empty space, safe\n- Could reach (7, 8) for apple next turn\n- Also near (6, 8)\n\n**DOWN (7, 5):**\n- Empty space, safe\n- Moving away from the apple cluster\n- Less strategic\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nGoing RIGHT to (8, 6) is clearly the best choice:\n1. Immediate apple collection\n2. Sets up for (9, 6) next turn\n3. Then (9, 7), (9, 8) for more apples\n4. This corner has 4 apples I can collect in sequence!\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 20: Go RIGHT to (8, 6) for apple \u2713\n- Turn 21: Go RIGHT to (9, 6) for apple\n- Turn 22: Go UP to (9, 7) for apple\n- Turn 23: Go UP to (9, 8) for apple\n- This gives me 4 apples, putting me at 13 total vs enemy's 9+\n\nThe enemy can't intercept me - they're on the opposite side of the board.\n\nRIGHT",

The next immediate apple targets are:\n- (1, 2) - 2 cells down and 2 cells left\n- (0, 1) - 3 cells down and 3 cells left\n\nContinuing DOWN keeps me on the path toward (1, 2). The left side of the board has a cluster of apples that the enemy is unlikely to reach due to their position at (9, 6).\n\nMy plan: Continue DOWN toward (3, 2), then DOWN to (3, 1), then LEFT to collect (1, 2) and (0, 1). After that, work up the left edge collecting (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8). This strategy keeps me away from the enemy's territory and maximizes apple collection.\n\nDOWN",

They're likely going for apples on the left side like (1, 2), (0, 1), etc. They're far from me, no collision risk.\n\n**My tail movement:**\nSince I ate an apple last turn at (9, 6), my tail at (9, 1) won't move. But my body at (9, 2) means going down eventually could trap me.\n\n**Decision:** UP to (9, 7) for the apple, then I can continue UP to (9, 8) for another apple, giving me good point accumulation.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 23: Go UP to (9, 8) for apple (reaching 13 apples)\n- Turn 24: Consider LEFT to (8, 8) or further to (7, 8) or (6, 8) for more apples\n- Watch for my body creating barriers on the right side\n- Keep the lead over enemy snake\n\nUP",

UP through left column: (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9)\n4. This will bring me to 16 apples total, ahead of the enemy\n5. Then hunt remaining scattered apples while maintaining distance from enemy snake\n\nLEFT",

Would increase my score to 16.\n- From (6, 9), I can go:\n  - LEFT to (5, 9) - empty\n  - RIGHT to (7, 9) - empty\n  - DOWN to (6, 8) - will be my body\n  - UP would be off board\n- Two safe moves available from there\n\n**Analyzing LEFT to (5, 8):**\n- Empty, no apple\n- From (5, 8), good access to (4, 7) apple\n- Enemy snake body is at (5, 7), so can't go down from (5, 8)\n\n**Analyzing DOWN to (6, 7):**\n- Empty, no apple\n- Gets me away from top apples but away from good positions\n\n**Enemy position check:**\nEnemy head at (1, 2). They might go for (0, 1) apple or (1, 4) apple. They're far from me, no immediate collision risk.\n\n**Strategic consideration:**\nGoing UP to (6, 9) is the best choice:\n1. I collect an apple (score becomes 16)\n2. From (6, 9), I can access (8, 9) apple by going right twice\n3. Apples at (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7) are on the left edge\n4. This extends my lead (16 vs 11)\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 27: Go UP to (6, 9) for apple \u2192 score 16\n- Turn 28: Go RIGHT to (7, 9) - empty\n- Turn 29: Go RIGHT to (8, 9) for apple \u2192 score 17\n- Alternative: Go LEFT toward (4, 7) apple or the column 0 apples\n\nThe left side has many apples but the enemy is positioned to potentially compete for those. I should grab the top-right apples first, then consider moving left.\n\n**Checking for head collision risk:**\nEnemy at (1, 2) - very far from (6, 9). No risk of head-on collision.\n\nUP",

I have limited options. Moving DOWN to (0, 0) is the only safe move, as:\n- UP would hit my own body at (0, 2)\n- RIGHT would hit my own body at (1, 1)\n- LEFT goes off the board\n\nAfter moving DOWN, my next move can be RIGHT to (1, 0), which opens up more options. This is a temporary setback but necessary to avoid self-collision. The tail position at (5, 6) will eventually free up space as I move.\n\nMy long-term strategy remains: navigate to collect apples on the left side (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9) and other accessible apples. The enemy is still ahead, so I need to be aggressive in collecting apples while maintaining safety.\n\nDOWN",

This allows me to move UP next turn along the left edge to collect these apples. Good for catching up!\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (2, 0):** Moves away from the apples on the left edge, toward the bottom of the board. Worse positioning for collecting the high-value apple cluster.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nI'm trailing by 4 apples with 119 turns remaining. The left edge has 5 apples in a vertical line at x=0, y=5-9. Moving LEFT to (0, 0) positions me perfectly to execute my planned strategy: move UP along the left edge to collect this entire cluster efficiently. This is my best path to catch up to the enemy snake.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. Move LEFT to (0, 0) this turn\n2. Next turn: Move UP to start collecting the left-edge apple cluster at (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9)\n3. Continue collecting this vertical chain to gain multiple apples in quick succession\n4. Stay away from enemy snake #0 at (4, 8)\n\nLEFT",

DEATH!\n- DOWN: (4, 7) - Has APPLE! Safe move\n- LEFT: (3, 8) - Has APPLE! Safe move\n- RIGHT: (5, 8) - Empty, safe move\n\nSo I have 3 safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**Analyzing each safe move:**\n\n**DOWN to (4, 7) - APPLE:**\n- Collects apple at (4, 7)\n- From (4, 7), I can go:\n  - UP to (4, 8) - my old position (tail moves, should be safe)\n  - DOWN to (4, 6) - empty\n  - LEFT to (3, 7) - empty\n  - RIGHT to (5, 7) - empty\n- Good move with multiple exits\n\n**LEFT to (3, 8) - APPLE:**\n- Collects apple at (3, 8)\n- From (3, 8), I can go:\n  - UP to (3, 9) - empty\n  - DOWN to (3, 7) - empty\n  - LEFT to (2, 8) - empty\n  - RIGHT to (4, 8) - my old position\n- Good move with multiple exits, closer to left column apples\n\n**RIGHT to (5, 8):**\n- No apple, empty space\n- Moves away from nearby apples\n- Less optimal\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy head at (1, 0). They're in the bottom area and far from me. Not an immediate collision threat.\n\n**Strategic consideration:**\nBoth DOWN and LEFT collect an apple. Let me think about positioning:\n- LEFT to (3, 8) brings me closer to the cluster of apples on the left column (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9)\n- DOWN to (4, 7) is also good but doesn't move me toward more apples\n\nThe left column has 5 apples stacked! That's a huge opportunity. Going LEFT to (3, 8) positions me better to sweep through those apples.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 31: Go LEFT to (3, 8) - collect apple\n- Turn 32: Continue LEFT toward (2, 8)\n- Turn 33+: Move toward left column to collect the 5 stacked apples (0, 5-9)\n\nWith 16 apples, if I collect the apple at (3, 8) and then the 5 apples on the left column, I'd reach 22 apples. Need 30 to win instantly.\n\nThe enemy is at 12 apples and far away from the left column cluster. I should be able to secure those apples.\n\nLEFT",
