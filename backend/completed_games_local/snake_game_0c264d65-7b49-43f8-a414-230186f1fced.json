My current position is at the bottom of the board with no body, so I have all four options initially: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck immediate hazards:\n- Moving LEFT from (5,0) to (4,0): safe, no body or edge.\n- Moving RIGHT from (5,0) to (6,0): safe, no body or edge.\n- Moving UP from (5,0) to (5,1): safe.\n- Moving DOWN from (5,0) to (5,-1): off board, so unsafe.\n\nPrioritize moving toward the apple at (4,4). To reach (4,4), I need to move LEFT and then UP multiple times, but directly moving LEFT immediately could be a good initial step.\n\nGiven that, moving LEFT to (4,0) keeps me safe and clears the path toward the apple at (4,4). From there, I can plan to go UP to approach the apple around (4,4).\n\nNext, consider avoiding enemy head collisions: the enemy snake is at (7,6), which is quite far from my current position, so immediate collision danger is low.\n\nAlso, moving UP could be considered, but at (5,0), going UP would take me further away from immediate apple targets and could lead to dead-end scenarios if I go too far without a plan.\n\nTherefore, the best initial move is LEFT to (4,0).\n\nI'll choose LEFT to start heading toward the apples.\n\n**My move:** LEFT",

Future moves from there: still 3 directions safe (except possibly DOWN back to current cell, but that\u2019s fine).\n- **DOWN** (7,5): moves closer to (7,2) (now 3 steps away). From (7,5), next turn could go DOWN again to (7,4) etc. Good progress toward apple.\n- **LEFT** (6,6): moves slightly away from (7,2) (now 5 steps). Not better.\n- **RIGHT** (8,6): moves away from (7,2) (now 5 steps). Not better.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long\u2011term plan note for next turn:**\nGoal: collect nearest apple at (7,2) while staying safe. Move DOWN this turn to (7,5). Next turn, if still safe, move DOWN again to (7,4), then (7,3), then (7,2) to eat. Watch enemy movement\u2014currently far away, but may approach other apples.

Possible moves: UP\u2192(3,3), DOWN\u2192(3,1), LEFT\u2192(2,2), RIGHT\u2192(4,2).  \nMy possible destinations: (7,1), (6,2), (8,2). None intersect enemy\u2019s possible moves \u2192 no head\u2011on collision possible this turn.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Evaluate apple proximity and future options:**  \nClosest apples in Manhattan distance from (7,2):  \n- (7,4) distance = |7-7| + |4-2| = 2  \n- (3,4) distance = 4 + 2 = 6  \n- (4,4) distance = 3 + 2 = 5  \n- (2,5) distance = 5 + 3 = 8  \n- (2,7) distance = 5 + 5 = 10  \n\nThe nearest is (7,4) \u2013 two steps away.  \n- To reach (7,4) I need to go UP eventually, but UP is blocked by my own body this turn. Next turn my tail will move forward (if I move away from it), so (7,3) may become free.  \n- If I move DOWN or LEFT/RIGHT, I move away from (7,4) temporarily, but I can loop back.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Check safety after each safe move (next turn considerations):**  \n\n- **DOWN to (7,1):**  \n  Next turn my body will be: head at (7,1), tail at (7,2) (since tail follows).  \n  From (7,1) safe moves: UP (7,2) \u2013 into my new body? Yes, body at (7,2) \u2192 blocked. LEFT (6,1), RIGHT (8,1), DOWN (7,0). So 3 safe exits.  \n\n- **LEFT to (6,2):**  \n  Next turn body: head at (6,2), tail at (7,2).  \n  From (6,2) safe moves: UP (6,3), DOWN (6,1), LEFT (5,2), RIGHT (7,2) \u2013 but (7,2) will be my body \u2192 blocked. So 3 safe exits.  \n\n- **RIGHT to (8,2):**  \n  Next turn body: head at (8,2), tail at (7,2).  \n  From (8,2) safe moves: UP (8,3), DOWN (8,1), LEFT (7,2) \u2013 blocked, RIGHT (9,2). So 3 safe exits.  \n\nAll three keep 3 safe exits next turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Strategic preference:**  \nI want to eventually target apple at (7,4). Moving DOWN now puts me farther in y-direction, requiring two UP moves later. Moving LEFT or RIGHT keeps me at y=2, closer in y to the apple.  \nBetween LEFT and RIGHT:  \n- LEFT (6,2) moves me toward board center (more future apple options).  \n- RIGHT (8,2) moves me toward right edge, slightly more limiting.  \nEnemy is at (3,2) \u2013 moving LEFT brings me slightly closer to enemy but still far enough.  \n\nApple at (7,4) is directly above my tail (7,3). If I move LEFT or RIGHT this turn, next turn my tail will advance to (7,2), freeing (7,3). Then I could move UP to (6,3) or (8,3) and then UP again to (6,4)/(8,4) and then horizontally toward (7,4). That\u2019s a longer path.  \n\nActually, the quickest path to (7,4) from (7,2) is: UP (blocked this turn), wait one turn, then UP next turn. That means I should stay in a position where next turn I can move UP to (7,3) (which will be free if my tail moves). To do that, I need to be at (7,1) or (6,2) or (8,2) such that moving UP reaches (7,3) or an adjacent cell that allows subsequent UP.  \n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,1), next turn UP goes to (7,2) (my body then), not helpful.  \nIf I move LEFT to (6,2), next turn UP to (6,3) \u2013 then I\u2019m at (6,3), still need two steps to (7,4): RIGHT to (7,3) then UP to (7,4). That\u2019s three steps total.  \nIf I move RIGHT to (8,2), similar: UP to (8,3), LEFT to (7,3), UP to (7,4) \u2013 three steps.  \n\nSo all three safe moves yield similar path lengths to (7,4).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Choose move that also improves overall board position:**  \nMoving LEFT toward center (more space, more apples) seems slightly better. Also, enemy is at (3,2); moving LEFT doesn\u2019t immediately approach it but keeps options open.  \n\n**Long\u2011term plan for next few turns:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (6,2), next turn aim to go UP to (6,3) if safe, then right toward apple at (7,4). Monitor enemy movement; it may go for apples at (3,4) or (4,4). Keep distance. With length 2, avoid boxing myself; prefer moves that keep \u22652 safe exits.  \n\n**Final move choice:**  \nLEFT  \n\nLEFT",

Length = 2.  \n- Enemy snake #1 head at (4,3), length 1.  \n- Apples at (4,4), (2,5), (3,4), (2,7), (7,4).  \n- Last turn I moved UP from (6,2) to (6,3). My tail stayed at (6,2) because I didn\u2019t eat an apple last turn.  \n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Check each possible move for immediate death:**  \n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (6,4).  \n   - Within board? Yes.  \n   - Into own body? No.  \n   - Into enemy body? Enemy body is only at (4,3) \u2013 no.  \n   - Safe. \u2705  \n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (6,2).  \n   - Within board? Yes.  \n   - Into own body? Yes, my tail is at (6,2). This would kill me. \u274c **Eliminate.**  \n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (5,3).  \n   - Within board? Yes.  \n   - No body collision. \u2705  \n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,3).  \n   - Within board? Yes.  \n   - No body collision. \u2705  \n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy movement and head\u2011on collision risk:**  \nEnemy head at (4,3). Possible moves: UP\u2192(4,4), DOWN\u2192(4,2), LEFT\u2192(3,3), RIGHT\u2192(5,3).  \nMy possible destinations: (6,4), (5,3), (7,3).  \n- If I move LEFT to (5,3), enemy could move RIGHT to (5,3) \u2192 head\u2011on collision \u2192 both die. That\u2019s risky.  \n- If I move UP to (6,4) or RIGHT to (7,3), no overlap with enemy\u2019s possible moves.  \n\nSo LEFT carries a head\u2011on collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Evaluate apple proximity and future options:**  \nClosest apples in Manhattan distance from (6,3):  \n- (7,4) distance = |7-6| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2  \n- (4,4) distance = 2 + 1 = 3  \n- (3,4) distance = 3 + 1 = 4  \n- (2,5) distance = 4 + 2 = 6  \n- (2,7) distance = 4 + 4 = 8  \n\nNearest is (7,4).  \n- To reach (7,4) I need to move RIGHT then UP, or UP then RIGHT.  \n- Moving UP to (6,4) puts me one step away from (7,4) (RIGHT then UP? Actually from (6,4) to (7,4) is RIGHT, distance 1).  \n- Moving RIGHT to (7,3) puts me one step away from (7,4) (UP, distance 1).  \n- Moving LEFT moves away from the nearest apple.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Check safety after each safe move (next turn considerations):**  \n\n- **UP to (6,4):**  \n  Next turn my body will be: head at (6,4), tail at (6,3).  \n  From (6,4) safe moves: UP (6,5), DOWN (6,3) \u2013 blocked, LEFT (5,4), RIGHT (7,4) \u2013 if apple still there, eating it would grow. So 3 safe exits.  \n\n- **RIGHT to (7,3):**  \n  Next turn body: head at (7,3), tail at (6,3).  \n  From (7,3) safe moves: UP (7,4) \u2013 apple, DOWN (7,2), LEFT (6,3) \u2013 blocked, RIGHT (8,3). So 3 safe exits.  \n\n- **LEFT to (5,3):**  \n  Next turn body: head at (5,3), tail at (6,3).  \n  From (5,3) safe moves: UP (5,4), DOWN (5,2), LEFT (4,3) \u2013 enemy currently at (4,3), but enemy may move; still risky, RIGHT (6,3) \u2013 blocked. So 3 safe exits, but one is toward enemy\u2019s current position.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Strategic preference:**  \nI want to avoid head\u2011on collision risk this turn, so LEFT is less desirable. Between UP and RIGHT:  \n- UP moves me to (6,4), closer to apple (7,4) and also closer to apple (4,4) but that\u2019s near enemy.  \n- RIGHT moves me to (7,3), directly below apple (7,4) \u2013 next turn I could move UP to eat it.  \n- Enemy is at (4,3); moving RIGHT keeps more distance from enemy than moving UP (which brings me closer to the row where enemy might move UP to (4,4)).  \n\n**Long\u2011term plan for next few turns:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (7,3), next turn I can move UP to (7,4) to eat the apple, growing to length 3. That will give me an apple lead and keep my tail behind me. I should monitor enemy movement; it may go for (4,4) or (3,4). With length 3, I need to avoid boxing myself; prefer moves that keep \u22652 safe exits.  \n\n**Final move choice:**  \nRIGHT",

My tail is still at (6,3) because growth happens after movement; next turn my tail will stay in place (I will become length 3 with tail at (6,3) until I move again). Actually, after eating, the tail doesn\u2019t move on the next turn, so my body now is head (7,4), then (7,3), then (6,3).  \n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Check each possible move for immediate death:**  \n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (7,5).  \n   - Within board? Yes.  \n   - Into own body? No (body at (7,3), (6,3)).  \n   - Into enemy body? Enemy body at (4,4), (4,3) \u2013 no.  \n   - Safe. \u2705  \n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (7,3).  \n   - Within board? Yes.  \n   - Into own body? Yes, my body segment at (7,3) is directly behind my head. This would kill me. \u274c **Eliminate.**  \n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (6,4).  \n   - Within board? Yes.  \n   - Into own body? No.  \n   - Into enemy body? No.  \n   - Safe. \u2705  \n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (8,4).  \n   - Within board? Yes.  \n   - Into own body? No.  \n   - Into enemy body? No.  \n   - Safe. \u2705  \n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy movement and head\u2011on collision risk:**  \nEnemy head at (3,4). Possible enemy moves: UP\u2192(3,5), DOWN\u2192(3,3), LEFT\u2192(2,4), RIGHT\u2192(4,4) (but (4,4) is its own body, so that would kill it; enemy likely won\u2019t choose RIGHT).  \nMy possible destinations: (7,5), (6,4), (8,4).  \nNo overlap with enemy\u2019s possible moves \u2192 no head\u2011on collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Evaluate apple proximity and future options:**  \nClosest apples in Manhattan distance from (7,4):  \n- (7,5) distance = 1 (directly above)  \n- (4,9) distance = |7-4|+|4-9| = 3+5 = 8  \n- (2,5) distance = 5+1 = 6  \n- (2,7) distance = 5+3 = 8  \n- (1,9) distance = 6+5 = 11  \n\nNearest is (7,5) directly above me. Moving UP eats it immediately, giving me apple lead (3 vs enemy\u2019s 2) and growing to length 4.  \nLEFT to (6,4) moves toward center but away from nearest apple. RIGHT to (8,4) moves away from apples.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Check safety after each safe move (next turn considerations):**  \n\n- **UP to (7,5) \u2013 eating apple:**  \n  After eating, my body will be: head (7,5), then (7,4), (7,3), tail (6,3). Length = 4.  \n  From (7,5) next turn safe moves: UP (7,6), DOWN (7,4) \u2013 blocked by own body, LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5). So 3 safe exits. Good.  \n\n- **LEFT to (6,4):**  \n  Not eating apple. Body: head (6,4), then (7,4), (7,3), tail (6,3).  \n  From (6,4) next turn safe moves: UP (6,5), DOWN (6,3) \u2013 blocked by own tail? Wait, tail is at (6,3) now, but after moving, tail will move? Actually, if I don\u2019t eat, my tail moves forward: my body becomes head (6,4), then (7,4), then (7,3) (new tail). So from (6,4) next turn, body cells will be (7,4) and (7,3). Then DOWN to (6,3) is empty, so safe. Let\u2019s check: possible moves from (6,4): UP (6,5), DOWN (6,3), LEFT (5,4), RIGHT (7,4) \u2013 blocked by own body. So 3 safe exits.  \n\n- **RIGHT to (8,4):**  \n  Not eating apple. Body: head (8,4), then (7,4), (7,3), tail (6,3).  \n  From (8,4) next turn safe moves: UP (8,5), DOWN (8,3), LEFT (7,4) \u2013 blocked, RIGHT (9,4). So 3 safe exits.  \n\nAll three safe moves give 3 safe exits next turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Strategic preference:**  \nEating the apple at (7,5) increases my lead and length, making me safer from being trapped and more threatening in head\u2011on collisions. The move is safe and leaves good options. Enemy is far away (at (3,4)), so no immediate threat.  \n\n**Long\u2011term plan for next few turns:**  \nAfter eating apple at (7,5), I\u2019ll be length 4 with head at (7,5). Next turn I should avoid DOWN into (7,4). I can consider moving UP to (7,6) or LEFT to (6,5) to stay flexible and approach other apples (e.g., (4,9) or (2,5)). Monitor enemy movement; if enemy moves north toward (2,5) area, I can maneuver to keep distance or cut it off.  \n\n**Final move choice:**  \nUP",

Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP\u2192(2,6), DOWN\u2192(2,4), LEFT\u2192(1,5), RIGHT\u2192(3,5) (into its own body at (3,5) \u2013 would kill it, so unlikely).  \n\nMy possible destinations: (6,6), (6,4), (5,5).  \nNo overlap with enemy\u2019s possible moves \u2192 no head\u2011on collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Evaluate apple proximity and future options:**  \nApples: (2,7), (1,9), (4,9), (3,1), (2,1).  \nFrom my head (6,5), Manhattan distances:  \n- (2,7): |6-2|+|5-7| = 4+2 = 6  \n- (1,9): 5+4 = 9  \n- (4,9): 2+4 = 6  \n- (3,1): 3+4 = 7  \n- (2,1): 4+4 = 8  \n\nClosest are (2,7) and (4,9) at distance 6.  \n\n- **UP to (6,6)**: distances to (2,7)=|4|+|1|=5, to (4,9)=|2|+|3|=5 \u2013 improves toward both nearest apples.  \n- **DOWN to (6,4)**: distances to (2,7)=|4|+|3|=7, to (4,9)=|2|+|5|=7 \u2013 worse.  \n- **LEFT to (5,5)**: distances to (2,7)=|3|+|2|=5, to (4,9)=|1|+|4|=5 \u2013 also improves.  \n\nBoth UP and LEFT bring me closer to the nearest apples.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Check safety after each safe move (next turn considerations):**  \n\n- **UP to (6,6) \u2013 not eating apple:**  \n  After moving, body: head (6,6), then (6,5), (7,5), (7,4) (tail (7,3) drops off).  \n  From (6,6) next turn safe moves: UP (6,7), DOWN (6,5) \u2013 blocked by own body, LEFT (5,6), RIGHT (7,6). So 3 safe exits.  \n\n- **DOWN to (6,4) \u2013 not eating apple:**  \n  After moving, body: head (6,4), then (6,5), (7,5), (7,4) \u2013 note (7,4) is still in body.  \n  From (6,4) next turn safe moves: UP (6,5) \u2013 blocked, DOWN (6,3), LEFT (5,4), RIGHT (7,4) \u2013 blocked. So only 2 safe exits (DOWN, LEFT). Riskier.  \n\n- **LEFT to (5,5) \u2013 not eating apple:**  \n  After moving, body: head (5,5), then (6,5), (7,5), (7,4).  \n  From (5,5) next turn safe moves: UP (5,6), DOWN (5,4), LEFT (4,5), RIGHT (6,5) \u2013 blocked. So 3 safe exits.  \n\nDOWN gives fewer future options, so I\u2019ll eliminate it unless necessary.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Strategic preference and long\u2011term plan:**  \nUP and LEFT both give good future mobility and move toward nearest apples.  \nEnemy is at (2,5) and may move toward (2,7) via UP then LEFT, or toward (4,9) via RIGHT then UP. I should aim to claim one of these apples before it does.  \nUP to (6,6) positions me well to go toward (4,9) via LEFT\u2011UP moves, or toward (2,7) via more LEFT/UP.  \nLEFT to (5,5) also works but is slightly farther from (4,9) in vertical distance.  \n\nGiven the board layout, moving UP opens more vertical space and keeps me central. I\u2019ll choose UP.  \n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nAfter UP to (6,6), assess enemy\u2019s move. If enemy moves toward (2,7), I can consider moving toward (4,9) via LEFT then UP. If enemy heads toward (4,9), I might aim for (2,7) or (1,9). Keep building lead (currently tied 3 apples each). Avoid getting pinned near top edge after a few moves.  \n\nUP",

Possible moves: UP (4,7) \u2013 blocked, DOWN (4,5), LEFT (3,6), RIGHT (5,6).

Apple (4,9) is safer from immediate enemy competition.\n\nGiven the tie in apples (3\u20133), securing an apple quickly is valuable. UP to (4,8) gives me a clear shot at (4,9) next turn with less enemy contest risk. LEFT to (3,7) risks enemy also moving toward (2,7) and potential head\u2011on collision next turn if we both go for it.\n\n**Long\u2011term plan for next few turns:**  \nAfter UP to (4,8):  \n- Next turn, if apple (4,9) is still there, move UP to eat it and grow.  \n- If enemy eats (4,9) before me, reassess: from (4,8) I can go LEFT toward (2,7) or DOWN/LEFT to other apples.  \n- Keep monitoring enemy\u2019s position to avoid converging on same apple simultaneously.  \n- Maintain central flexibility and avoid trapping myself near edges.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current game state, I need to choose a safe move that positions me well.\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Immediate safety from my head (4,8):**\nMy body: [(4,7), (5,7), (6,7)]\nEnemy body: [(1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5)]\n\n1. **UP \u2192 (4,9)**\n   - Within board? Yes (0-9).\n   - Into own body? No.\n   - Into enemy body? No.\n   - Safe \u2705\n\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (4,7)**\n   - Within board? Yes.\n   - Into own body? **Yes**, (4,7) is my first body segment directly behind my head. \u274c Eliminate.\n\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (3,8)**\n   - Within board? Yes.\n   - Into own body? No.\n   - Into enemy body? No.\n   - Safe \u2705\n\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (5,8)**\n   - Within board? Yes.\n   - Into own body? No.\n   - Into enemy body? No.\n   - Safe \u2705\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Head-on collision risk with enemy #1 (head at (1,9)):**\nEnemy\u2019s possible moves from (1,9):\n- UP \u2192 (1,10) \u274c Off board (y=10 invalid). Not safe for enemy.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,8) \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,9) \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,9) \u2705\n\nMy possible destinations: (4,9), (3,8), (5,8).\nNo overlap with enemy's possible safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). So no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**\nApples: (2,7), (4,9), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2)\nFrom my head (4,8), Manhattan distances:\n- (2,7): |2|+|1|=3\n- (4,9): |0|+|1|=1\n- (3,1): |1|+|7|=8\n- (2,1): |2|+|7|=9\n- (2,2): |2|+|6|=8\n\nClosest is (4,9) at distance 1 (directly above me).\n- **UP to (4,9)**: lands on the apple! Eat and grow.\n- **LEFT to (3,8)**: distances to (4,9)=|1|+|1|=2, to (2,7)=|1|+|1|=2.\n- **RIGHT to (5,8)**: distances to (4,9)=|1|+|1|=2, to (2,7)=|3|+|1|=4.\n\nUP directly collects an apple, increasing my score to 4 and tying Snake #1.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**\n- **UP to (4,9) and eat apple**: My snake grows. New body will be: head at (4,9), then old head (4,8), then (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). Length becomes 5. Next turn from (4,9), possible moves: DOWN (4,8) \u2013 blocked by own new body segment, LEFT (3,9), RIGHT (5,9). So 2 safe exits (LEFT, RIGHT). Being at the top edge reduces mobility slightly, but I just scored.\n- **LEFT to (3,8)**: No apple. Body: head (3,8), then (4,8), (4,7), (5,7), tail (6,7). Next turn from (3,8), possible moves: UP (3,9), DOWN (3,7), LEFT (2,8), RIGHT (4,8) \u2013 blocked by own body. So 3 safe exits. Puts me closer to apple (2,7).\n- **RIGHT to (5,8)**: No apple. Body: head (5,8), then (4,8), (4,7), (5,7), tail (6,7). Next turn from (5,8), possible moves: UP (5,9), DOWN (5,7) \u2013 blocked by own body?, wait (5,7) is in my body (third segment). Yes, blocked. LEFT (4,8) \u2013 blocked, RIGHT (6,8). So only 2 safe exits (UP, RIGHT). Mobility is poor.\n\nLEFT offers good mobility and path to another apple. UP scores immediately but reduces next-turn mobility. RIGHT is weak.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy threat and competition:**\nEnemy at (1,9) is adjacent to apple (4,9)? Actually distance from (1,9) to (4,9) is |3|+|0|=3. Enemy could move RIGHT to (2,9), then next turn RIGHT to (3,9), then RIGHT to (4,9) in three turns. But if I move UP now, I eat (4,9) before enemy can reach it. That's good.\nEnemy is also close to apple (2,7) (distance |1|+|2|=3). If I go LEFT to (3,8), I'm one step from (2,7) (distance 2 via LEFT then DOWN?), actually from (3,8) to (2,7) is LEFT+DOWN, two steps. Enemy could potentially get there in two moves as well (e.g., DOWN to (1,8), then LEFT to (0,8) or RIGHT to (2,8)? Not directly toward (2,7)). Might be a race.\n\nGiven the scores (me 3, enemy 4), catching up is important. UP gives me an immediate apple, tying the score. The reduced mobility next turn is a trade-off, but I'll be at 4 apples and can plan from there. Since the enemy is at (1,9), they might move away from my area, reducing immediate collision risk.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:**\nAfter UP to (4,9) and eating:\n- Next turn from (4,9), I'll have 2 safe moves: LEFT (3,9) or RIGHT (5,9). Prefer LEFT to move toward center and apple (2,7) area.\n- Monitor enemy movement. If enemy moves toward my area, avoid head-on.\n- Since I'll be longer, be mindful of not boxing myself in. Aim to loop back toward center.\n- With scores tied, focus on securing another apple while staying safe.\n\nUP",
