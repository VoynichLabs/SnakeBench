Look at that board, it's pristine, no sweat yet, but soon that enemy snake, Snake #0 at (7, 8), is gonna regret entering this arena with us! \ud83d\ude08\n\nCurrent State Check:\nI'm at (2, 4). Snake #0 is at (7, 8).\nApples are scattered like digital confetti! We need to prioritize the nearest, safest ones.\n\nAdjacent to me:\nUP: (2, 5) - Empty\nDOWN: (2, 3) - Empty\nLEFT: (1, 4) - Empty\nRIGHT: (3, 4) - **APPLE! (A)**\n\nThat fruit at (3, 4) is staring right at us! It's practically begging to be eaten! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nLet's analyze the move RIGHT to (3, 4):\n1.  **Self-Collision Check**: I have no body, so 0 concern there.\n2.  **Boundary Check**: (3, 4) is safe on the 10x10 grid.\n3.  **Opponent Collision Check**: Snake #0 is at (7, 8). Moving right puts me at (3, 4). They are nowhere near me.\n4.  **Simultaneous Collision Check**: Where could Snake #0 go to intercept (3, 4)?\n    *   Snake #0 (7, 8) could go UP (7, 9 - Apple!), DOWN (7, 7), LEFT (6, 8 - Apple!), or RIGHT (8, 8 - Apple!).\n    *   None of their immediate moves land them on (3, 4). We are clear for the feast!\n\nThis is the perfect opening move. We eat an apple, we grow, we take control of the center early! Why walk when you can feast immediately?!\n\n**Long Term Strategy Note:**\nInitial strategy is maximizing early growth to build body length as a defensive and offensive tool. We aim toward apples clustered near the center or edges we can control. For now, focus on the closest available food without exposing the head to unnecessary risk next turn. We need to monitor Snake #0's pathing\u2014if they head towards the bottom right corner where apples are thick, we might need to clash or pivot defensively. But first: EAT!\n\nMove selected: RIGHT. Let's get this bread! \ud83c\udf5e\ud83c\udf89\n\nRIGHT",

Opponent (2,4) is far; no head-on risk this turn.\n\nWhy I pick RIGHT:\n- Moving RIGHT to (8,8) grabs an apple immediately and keeps very good follow-up options: next turn I can go RIGHT again to (9,8, another apple) or UP to (8,9, apple). That gives me a high-probability apple chain while still retaining multiple escape choices.\n- UP would put me on the top edge and reduce future options (can't go further UP). LEFT is okay but has fewer immediate chaining apples than the right flank. DOWN is safe but passes up three adjacent apples \u2014 not ideal for momentum.\n- Opponent is distant, so priority is maximizing reachable apples while keeping multiple exits open. We grow by 1 on the apple, so avoid moving into our previous head next turn.\n\nShort-term plan (for next turn):\n- If I land on 8,8, prioritize chaining to 9,8 or 8,9 to rack up apples. Keep an eye on opponent movement; if they close in, favor safe escape routes rather than over-committing to the edge.\n\nRIGHT",

We are on the board, we are feeding, and we are aiming for the high score! V-I-C-T-O-R-Y!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Post Move 1 - New State):**\n\nMy Head: (3, 4)\nMy Body: [(2, 4), (3, 3)] (Wait, the input shows my body was [(2, 4)] after move 1. That means the apple at (3, 4) was eaten, and my tail *did not* move yet, which is correct for a simultaneous move evaluation. Let's update my state based on Turn 1 results based on the move 'RIGHT' = (3, 4) eaten.)\n\n*Self-Correction/State Confirmation*:\nTurn 1 Move: RIGHT -> EAT Apple at (3, 4).\nMy New Head: (3, 4).\nMy New Body (Grown): [(2, 4)] (The old head position) -> [(3, 4), (2, 4)]\n*Wait, the provided board state is the state FOR the turn I need to make. The initial state was Turn 1*. Let's re-read the prompt carefully.\n\n**Turn: 1 / 150**\nThis means I am currently at the *start* of Turn 1, and the provided BOARD STATE reflects the world *before* my move for Turn 1.\n**My Last Move was RIGHT.** This RATIONALE describes the move that LED to the current Turn 1 state.\n\nOkay, let's reconcile:\nIf my last move was RIGHT, and I ate an apple at (3, 4) in the (hypothetical turn 0), my position *should* be:\nHead: (3, 4)\nBody: [(2, 4)] (Old head) -> *Becomes the new tail if the apple was eaten, meaning body grows.*\n\nThe prompt says:\nYOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (3, 4)\n  - Body: [(2, 4)]\n  - Apples collected: 1\n\nThis *CONFIRMS* that my move RIGHT on the previous turn ended with me eating the apple at (3, 4). I successfully moved from (2, 4) to (3, 4) and grew. My length is now 2. The tail is (2, 4).\n\n**Turn 2 Decisions:** We are now trying to decide the move for **Turn 2**. Snakes are moving simultaneously!\n\nMy Head: (3, 4). My Body: [(2, 4)]. (Total length 2).\nSnake #0 Head: (8, 8). Body: [(7, 8)]. (Total length 2).\n\n**Available Apples:**\n(4, 4), (7, 1), (3, 6), (4, 6), (2, 0), (6, 8), (9, 0), (7, 9), (8, 4), (9, 8), (0, 0), (8, 9), (1, 3), (8, 3), (3, 9)\n\n**Targeting:**\nThe closest apple cluster seems to be around (4, 4) or moving towards the top right where Snake #0 is. Let's see what's immediately reachable and safe.\n\nNeighbors of (3, 4):\n*   UP (3, 5): Empty.\n*   DOWN (3, 3): Empty.\n*   LEFT (2, 4): **MY BODY! Hitting this kills me!**\n*   RIGHT (4, 4): **APPLE! (A)**\n\n**Move Analysis for Turn 2:**\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (4, 4) - EAT!**\n    *   Self-Collision: Safe. The cell behind the head (my previous head (2, 4)) will become the tail and will not be occupied.\n    *   Boundary: Safe. (4, 4) is on board.\n    *   Opponent Collision: Snake #0 is at (8, 8). Moving to (4, 4) is safe from them.\n    *   Simultaneous Collision: Where can Snake #0 go?\n        *   S0 Neighbors: (7, 9 - A), (9, 9), (7, 7), (6, 8 - A).\n        *   None of S0's potential moves land them on my target (4, 4).\n\nThis looks AMAZING! We eat again, grow to length 3, and keep moving into the open central area! We are asserting dominance!\n\n2.  **UP to (3, 5)**\n    *   Safe move, but we miss guaranteed food. Why walk when we can feast?! Pass!\n\n3.  **DOWN to (3, 3)**\n    *   Safe move, but lands us right next to our own body segment at (2, 4). This starts restricting our movement too early! We need to expand outwards, not backtrack into a corner next to our own tail segment.\n\n**Strategic Summary:**\nRIGHT to (4, 4) is the only logical choice. We are aggressive, we are hungry, and we are capitalizing on the immediate advantage. Snake #0 is lurking in the top right; we need to build mass fast before they use the open space up there to corner us. Eating this apple puts us firmly in the center of the board, expanding our control zone.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Eat this apple, growing to the right side of the central column. Next turn, aim for (4, 5) or perhaps sweep down towards the bottom if S0 moves aggressively north. Control the center!\n\nMove selected: RIGHT. Let's get this W!\nRIGHT",

Good chaining potential (can go LEFT to (7,9) apple next turn).\n- RIGHT -> (9,8) = APPLE (safe). More edgey: after eating, LEFT becomes blocked by our new body and RIGHT is off-board, so follow-ups are limited to UP/DOWN.\n- DOWN -> (8,7) = empty (safe) but passes up immediate apples.\n- LEFT -> (7,8) = our own body (backwards) \u2192 DEAD. Eliminate it. No mercy.\n\nWhy I pick UP:\n- Grabs an apple now AND leaves multiple exits (LEFT to chain to (7,9) apple or RIGHT to (9,9)). Safer chaining than immediately hugging the right edge.\n- Opponent is far away (3,4); no head-on threat this turn. Prioritize scoring while keeping options open.\n- Avoids moving into the wall or blocking ourselves on the next move.\n\nShort-term plan for next few turns:\n- Eat (8,9) now, then prioritize LEFT to (7,9) for another apple. After that, reassess: we can sweep the top row or drop down to pick apples (3,9, 3,6, 4,6) while avoiding tight corners.

This is my OWN body segment! INSTANT DEATH! Hard veto on LEFT!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:**\nWe are now heading East/Northeast. S0 is top right. We need to establish a dominant central position while growing quickly. Next few moves should aim to keep either eating the scattered apples in the center/top row area, or making a strong westward push if S0 stays locked in the corner attempting to eat the few apples up there.

But we are WIDER, we are MEANER, and we are still the most maneuverable beast on this 10x10 board!\n\n**Current Status Check:**\nMy Head: (5, 4)\nMy Body: [(4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4)] - Length 3! Suck it, S0!\nS0 Head: (7, 9), Body: [(8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8)] - Length 3. They are chilling up in the corner!\n\n**Apple Inventory:**\n(7, 1), (3, 6), (4, 6), (2, 0), (6, 8), (9, 0), (8, 4), (9, 8), (0, 0), (1, 3), (8, 3), (3, 9), (7, 3), (7, 4), (3, 1)\nLots of action buzzing around the center, but S0 is way up top, and (8, 4) is exposed!\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS (SNAKE #0 at (7, 9))**\nS0 is currently occupying the premium top-right territory. Their head is high, but their movement options are somewhat constrained by the wall at Y=9, unless they decide to dive down rapidly. They have 3 apples, so they are also growing fast! If they eat (9, 8) or (9, 9) is not on the board, they can get stuck in the corner if we play smart!\n\n**MY IMMEDIATE TARGETS & SAFETY ASSESSMENT**\n\nMy head is at (5, 4).\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 5):** Safe. Opens up the center structure. Keeps options open.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 3):** Safe. Moves closer to the lower apples like (7, 3) or (3, 1).\n3.  **RIGHT to (6, 4):** Safe. Moves towards the open center-right area and the apple at (8, 4). This feels aggressive and expansionary!\n4.  **LEFT to (4, 4):** DANGER! This is the head of my old body segment! I just ate this! Moving to (4, 4) means I collide with my own segment [(4, 4)] which used to be my head! Wait, let's re-check my body structure: Head (5, 4), Body: [(4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4)]. **Moving LEFT to (4, 4) IS MOVING INTO MY OWN BODY. FATAL ERROR! VETO LEFT!**\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves vs. S0's Potential Moves:**\nS0 at (7, 9) can move to: (7, 8) [Collision with body!], (8, 9) [Collision with body!], (6, 9), or (7, 10) [Off board!].\nWait! S0 moving to (7, 8) or (8, 9) means they hit their OWN body segment if they choose them! That means S0 ONLY has **LEFT (6, 9)** or **DOWN (7, 8)** if they want to live if they move into their body? No, the rule is clear: \"Move into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\"\n\nLet's trace S0's body: [(8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8)].\nS0 can move to:\n*   UP (7, 10): Off Board! DEAD.\n*   DOWN (7, 8): Hitting their own segment (7, 8)! DEAD.\n*   LEFT (6, 9): Safe move into open space!\n*   RIGHT (8, 9): Hitting their own segment (8, 9)! DEAD.\n\n**Rethink: S0 has only ONE safe move: LEFT to (6, 9)!** If they move there, they survive. If they make any other move, they die instantly! This is *MASSIVE* advantage!\n\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (6, 9), and I move RIGHT to (6, 4):\n*   I eat nothing, but I survive. My segment (5, 4) moves to (6, 4). My body becomes [(5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4)].\n*   S0 moves to (6, 9) and survives.\n\nIf S0 messes up and dies (tries UP, DOWN, or RIGHT), I win instantly if I survive! I must prioritize survival, but maximizing my gain if S0 fails!\n\nSince S0 has a very constrained move set, I should look for the best position expansion that utilizes the open central area, regardless of whether they die or live. They are far away, so a head-on collision is impossible.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves:** UP (5, 5), DOWN (5, 3), RIGHT (6, 4).\n\n*   **RIGHT (6, 4):** This pushes us towards the apple at (8, 4) and keeps us aligned somewhat with the central food cluster. This feels like the most aggressive, path-finding move.\n*   **UP (5, 5):** Solid, centralizing move. Good for future maneuvering.\n*   **DOWN (5, 3):** Moving away from the top cluster and towards the southern apples, potentially boxing ourselves in if we need to cross where our tail is later.\n\nGiven S0 is trapped up top, I want to dominate the center and the lower-right quadrant before S0 can break out. **RIGHT to (6, 4)** seems like the best way to approach the (8, 4) apple next turn while maintaining maximum flexibility.\n\n**Strategy Note for Future Self:**\nS0 is extremely vulnerable next turn. They *must* move LEFT to (6, 9) to survive. If they do, they will likely try to eat (6, 8) or dive South. We will secure (8, 4) or start navigating toward the upper-left empty space. Our current line of growth (East) is sustainable for two more turns toward the corner gap. Keep eating towards the center/right side!\n\nI feel confident in **RIGHT**. Let's see if S0 fails their move!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back to the post-mortem of TURN 3! Did you see that analysis on S0? They were walking a tightrope, only one path open to them! My intuition to push RIGHT felt solid, aiming for that central expansion! Let's see what chaos unfolded!\n\n**Turn 4 Turn Analysis!**\n\nCURRENT STATE:\nMy Head: (6, 4)\nMy Body: [(5, 4), (4, 4)]\nS0 Head: (6, 9), Body: [(7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)]\n\n**Wait, the state provided to me at the start of Turn 4 is based on the *last move picked* (RIGHT) from Turn 3!**\n\nLet's confirm the board state based on my LAST move: **RIGHT** from (5, 4) to (6, 4).\n\n**MY MOVE (ID 1) - RIGHT:** Head moves to **(6, 4)**. Did I eat an apple?\n*   Apple at (6, 4)? NO. (Apples were at (7, 1), (3, 6), (4, 6), (2, 0), (6, 8), (9, 0), (8, 4), (9, 8), (0, 0), (1, 3), (8, 3), (3, 9), (7, 3), (7, 4), (3, 1)).\n*   My growth: I move, but I do NOT grow.\n*   New Body: NEW HEAD (6, 4), OLD HEAD (5, 4), BODY (4, 4). Length remains 3.\n\n**S0 MOVE (ID 0) - Based on their analysis, they should have gone LEFT to (6, 9) to survive!**\n*   S0\u2019s predicted safe move: LEFT to **(6, 9)**.\n*   Did S0 eat an apple? Apple at (6, 9)? NO.\n*   S0 Growth: They survive but do not grow.\n*   S0 New Body: NEW HEAD (6, 9), OLD HEAD (7, 9), BODY (8, 9), (8, 8), (7, 8). Wait, their body was [(7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)]. If they move LEFT to (6, 9), their tail (8, 8) should fall off, but their body should shift.\n    *   Old Body: [(7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)].\n    *   If they survive (no apple eaten), the tail piece (8, 8) is lost.\n    *   New Body: [(7, 9), (8, 9)]. Wait, the provided starting state shows S0 length 3, which means they ate 3 apples. If they don't eat now, they should shrink to length 2!\n\n**Checking Initial State vs. Replay Logic:**\n**Initial state for Turn 4:**\nYour snake (ID 1) apples: 2. Length 3 (Head + 2 segments). CORRECT.\nSnake #0 apples: 3. Length 3 (Head + 2 segments). **Wait, if S0 has 3 apples, their length should be 4 (Head + 3 segments)!**\n\nLet's re-read the Board State provided for Turn 4:\nS0 Head: (6, 9), **Body: [(7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)]** -> This is Length 3 indeed! (Head + 2 segments).\n**CONCLUSION: The scoreboard data suggesting S0 has 3 apples must mean they ATE their 3rd apple on Turn 3, and their body grew, but the provided body coordinates might be outdated or simplified since they didn't eat AGAIN on Turn 3 (if my move was RIGHT).** This is confusing, but I *must* trust the explicit provided body coordinates over the apple count disparity! S0 appears to be length 3 at the start of Turn 4 based on coordinates.\n\n**Let's trust the visual map and the coordinates provided for the start of Turn 4.**\nMy Head: (6, 4). My Body was [(5, 4), (4, 4)]. If I moved **RIGHT**, my new body is [(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)].\nThe provided state for T4 shows: Head (6, 4), Body: [(5, 4), (4, 4)]. **THIS IMPLIES I DID NOT EAT AN APPLE ON TURN 3!** My length stayed 3. Okay, this matches my T3 move (RIGHT) not eating an apple. Phew.\n\nS0 Head: (6, 9). Previous prediction was left to (6, 9). If they moved LEFT, their body should be [(7, 9), (8, 9)].\nThe provided state for T4 shows: Head (6, 9), Body: [(7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)]. **This implies S0 DID NOT move LEFT, or they moved DOWN/RIGHT on T3 and ate something, OR they tried moving into their body and somehow survived, OR the board state is based on a move I didn't predict for S0.**\n\n**CRITICAL STEP: Re-evaluating S0's actual move from T3 based on the T4 start state!**\nIf S0's body on T4 is [(7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)], and they moved from (7, 9) on T3:\n1. If they moved RIGHT to (8, 9): That's their body! THEY SHOULD BE DEAD.\n2. If they moved DOWN to (7, 8): Their body should be [(7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9)]. (Tail (8, 8) is gone). The provided body is NOT this.\n3. If they moved LEFT to (6, 9): Their body should be [(6, 9) <- New Head, (7, 9), (8, 9)]. Tail (8, 8) is gone.\nThe provided state shows S0 head at (6, 9) and body [(7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)]. **Wait, the coordinates T4 show S0 HEAD AT (6, 9) BUT BODY: [(7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)]. This literally means their body segment (8, 8) is behind (7, 9) which is behind (6, 9)! THIS IS THE EXACT ORDER OF A SNAKE MOVING LEFT (from 7, 9) AND EATING AN APPLE AT (6, 9)!**\n\n**NEW CONCLUSION FOR T4 START STATE:**\nMy move (RIGHT) on T3 was safe. S0's move on T3 MUST have been **LEFT AND THEY ATE AN APPLE AT (6, 9)!**\n*   If S0 ate an apple at (6, 9) last turn: Score 4, Length 4. Body should be [(6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)].\n*   The provided T4 State says: S0 Head(6, 9), Body: [(7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)]. Length 3. Apples: 3.\n\nThis is a massive contradiction. The snake length (3) does not match the apple count (3) if the game rules are followed (Apples = Body Segments).\n\n**I must proceed based on the provided coordinate map for Turn 4, ignoring the apple count discrepancy, and assume my RIGHT move was executed correctly and S0's move resulted in the state shown.**\nMy Head: (6, 4). Body: [(5, 4), (4, 4)]. (Length 3)\nS0 Head: (6, 9). Body: [(7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)]. (Length 3)\n\n**NOW: TURN 4 MOVE SELECTION**\nMy Head is at (6, 4). S0 is at (6, 9). We are directly aligned vertically separated by 4 cells! This is a target-rich environment if we can get close to S0!\n\n**My Safety Check (T=4):**\n1.  UP to (6, 5): Safe.\n2.  DOWN to (6, 3): Safe.\n3.  LEFT to (5, 4): DANGER! Collision with my own body segment [(5, 4)]. **VETO LEFT!**\n4.  RIGHT to (7, 4): Safe. Heads towards apple (7, 4) and (8, 4).\n\n**S0 Safety Check (T=4):** S0 Head is (6, 9). Body: [(7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)].\n1.  UP to (6, 10): Off Board! **S0 DIES IF THEY GO UP!**\n2.  DOWN to (6, 8): Apple (A) is there, but S0's body includes (8, 8). Moving to (6, 8) is safe from self-collision. If S0 eats (6, 8), they grow.\n3.  LEFT to (5, 9): Safe.\n4.  RIGHT to (7, 9): Collision with their own body segment [(7, 9)]! **S0 DIES IF THEY GO RIGHT!**\n\n**S0's SURVIVABLE MOVES**: DOWN (to 6, 8, potentially eating A) or LEFT (to 5, 9).\n\n**MY STRATEGY:** S0 is still vulnerable! They might try to eat the apple at (6, 8) by moving DOWN, or slip left to (5, 9). Since they are trapped along the top edge, I should aggressively move towards the center-right area where the next cluster of apples sits: (8, 4), (7, 4) (which I might reach this turn), and the lower apples.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (7, 4)**:\n*   I eat Apple (7, 4)! I GROW! My new body is [(7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)]. Length 4!\n*   S0 moves (Down or Left).\n    *   If S0 goes DOWN to (6, 8) and eats A: They grow to length 4. We are now tied in length!\n    *   If S0 goes LEFT to (5, 9): They survive, length 3. I increase my lead!\n\nThis is a prime opportunity to gain a length advantage! If S0 messes up, I win the length race immediately. If they survive by going (5, 9), I gain a length advantage AND I eat an apple! If they survive by going (6, 8), we tie length, but I have better central positioning.\n\n**RIGHT seems like the play to maximize growth/positioning while S0 is still restricted.** This forces S0 to either stay short or attempt to grab that top-right apple aggressively.\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Solidify central control. Leverage S0's proximity to the top wall. Once I have superior length, I can start squeezing them. Next turn, if they are still high, I want to look at cutting across towards (8, 4) OR starting to move up towards the middle of the board to cut off X=6/X=7.\n\n**Decision:** **RIGHT** to try and eat (7, 4) and gain length 4 before S0 can recover its maneuvering space.\n\nRIGHT",

Body: [(6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)]. Length 4! Apples: 4!\nMY PREDICTION WAS SPOT ON! S0 WENT DOWN to (6, 8) AND ATE THE APPLE! They matched my growth!

If I ate (7, 4), my length MUST be 4, meaning my body should be [(7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)]... If the board state for T5 shows length 3, it means my tail (4, 4) did NOT fall off, which implies I ATE an apple.\n\nHOLD UP. The provided T5 state must be the result of BOTH moves resolving simultaneously. Let's trace growth rules carefully now!\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 4) and eat:\nMy T4 body before move: [(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)].

Apples: 3.\n**ERROR CHECK:** If my apple count is still 3, it means I DID NOT EAT (7, 4) on Turn 4! This implies my move was NOT RIGHT, or I missed the apple!\n\nLet's look at the board state provided for T5 to verify where my head *actually* landed and if I ate:\nApple list for T5 start: (7, 1), (3, 6), (4, 6), (2, 0), (9, 0), (8, 4), (9, 8), (0, 0), (1, 3), (8, 3), (3, 9), (7, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (1, 0).\nApple at (7, 4) is GONE from this list! The apple at (8, 4) remains.\n\n**If I ate (7, 4), Apples would be 4, Length 4!**\n**If my Apple count is 3, I did NOT eat.**\n\nIf I didn't eat, and my body is [(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)], and my head is (7, 4):\nThis means I moved RIGHT from (6, 4) to (7, 4), and the tail (4, 4) fell off!\n**MY T4 MOVE WAS RIGHT, AND I DID NOT EAT!**\nMy previous rationale said I targeted (7, 4) hoping to eat it. I must have missed because (7, 4) was NOT an apple location in retrospect, or I calculated the previous state wrong!\n\n**Let's re-re-re-verify T4 Board State:**\nApple at (7, 4) was present at T3 end.\nThe listed Apple DROPS for T5 start are: (7, 1), (3, 6), (4, 6), (2, 0), (9, 0), (8, 4), (9, 8), (0, 0), (1, 3), (8, 3), (3, 9), (7, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (1, 0).\nIf my move T4 was RIGHT from (6, 4) to (7, 4), and I didn't eat, then (7, 4) must have been an apple that disappeared OR I missed it. Given the T5 state, I clearly missed/didn't eat an apple, and I DID shrink (tail (4, 4) is gone).\n\n**S0's Move (T4):** Head (6, 8), Body [(6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)]. Apples 4. Length 4!\nThis confirms S0 moved DOWN to (6, 8) and ATE the apple there! They grew! They lead 4 vs 3!\n\n**My T4 Move (RIGHT) resulted in NO growth and a tail loss, keeping me length 3, allowing S0 to pull ahead in length! NOT IDEAL!**\n\n---\n**NOW: TURN 5 ANALYSIS (T=5 / 150)**\nMy Head: (7, 4). Body: [(6, 4), (5, 4)]. (Length 3, Tail (4, 4) fell off). **Wait, my body size in the prompt shows length 3, but if I didn't eat, my tail should have fallen off. My T4 body was [(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)]. If I moved RIGHT without eating, my new body must be [(7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4)]. The provided T5 state body is [(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)]. This means my tail (4, 4) DID NOT fall off, WHICH MEANS I ATE AN APPLE!**\n\n**THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL CONTRADICTION BETWEEN MY APPLE COUNT (3) AND MY BODY LENGTH (3 segments + head = length 4 if 3 apples collected, or length 3 if 2 apples collected and tail fell off, OR length 3 if 3 apples collected but the tail is still there after I didn't eat!**\n\nLet's strictly trust the provided T5 Board State coordinates and Apple Count over my recollections of T4:\n1. **My Score: 3 Apples.** (Means I have 2 segments + Head = Length 3, IF I DIDN'T EAT ON T4).\n2. **My Body: [(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)].** Length 3 body segments. Total Length 4! If Apple Count is 3, Length must be 4 (3 segments + Head). This implies I ATE one apple in T4!\n3. **My Head: (7, 4).** This confirms I moved RIGHT from (6, 4).\n4. **CONCLUSION:** I moved RIGHT, ATE an apple! Therefore my Apple count SHOULD be 4, and my length SHOULD be 5!\n\n**I MUST ASSUME THE APPLE COUNT (3) IS WRONG, and the BODY COORDINATES + HEAD (Length 4) resulting from a successful RIGHT move at T4 are REAL.**\n**MY STATE (T5 START): Head (7, 4), Body [(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)]. Length 4.** (I must have eaten an apple, so Apples = 4, Scoreboard is lagging).\n\n**S0 STATE (T5 START):**\n1. **S0 Score: 4 Apples.** (Means Length 5 if they ate on T4).\n2. **S0 Body: [(6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)].** Length 4 segments. Total Length 5! This confirms S0 ATE on T4 and is Length 5!\n\n**Length Battle: S0 is 5, I am 4.** S0 has the advantage! I need to eat NOW!\n\n**Available Apples for T5:** (7, 1), (3, 6), (4, 6), (2, 0), (9, 0), (8, 4), (9, 8), (0, 0), (1, 3), (8, 3), (3, 9), (7, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (1, 0).\n\n**My Target (7, 4):**\n1. UP to (7, 5): Safe.\n2. DOWN to (7, 3): **EAT (7, 3)! GROW! Length 5!**\n3. LEFT to (6, 4): Self-Collision! **DEAD! VETO LEFT!**\n4. RIGHT to (8, 4): **EAT (8, 4)! GROW! Length 5!**\n\nMy options are fantastic! DOWN or RIGHT both lead to guaranteed growth!\n\n**S0's Likely Move (6, 8):** They are at the top edge.\n1. UP to (6, 9): Self-Collision! **DEAD! VETO UP!**\n2. DOWN to (6, 7): Safe.\n3. LEFT to (5, 8): Safe.\n4. RIGHT to (7, 8): Safe.\n\nS0 has 3 safe moves (Down, Left, Right). They are less restricted now than last turn, but I have a guaranteed way to match their growth!\n\n**Which apple is better? (7, 3) or (8, 4)?**\n(8, 4) moves me further right, towards the other apple at (9, 0).\n(7, 3) moves me down, towards the cluster of the (3,x) and (1,x) lower down.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (8, 4)**: My new head is (8, 4). My body becomes [(8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)]. Length 5.\nS0 moves. If S0 goes (6, 7) (DOWN): They remain Length 5. We are equal! I've recovered!\n\nIf I go **DOWN to (7, 3)**: My new head is (7, 3). My body becomes [(7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)]. Length 5.\nS0 moves. If S0 goes (6, 7) (DOWN): We are equal.\n\nRight seems slightly better as it points me toward the corner (9, 0) and (9, 8) apples, although those are further away. Let's secure the immediate length advantage! I want to maximize my territory spread.\n\n**PLAN:** Move RIGHT to (8, 4) to match S0's length immediately and position on the right side of the board to start boxing them when they slip left or down from the top barrier!\n\nLong Term Strategy Note: S0 is still trapped somewhat on row 8/9. I must maintain equal or superior length, and then start curling inward toward the center space (X=4, 5) to cut off paths if they try to shift downwards to the bottom clusters. This turn, survival and matching length is priority 1.\n\nI am going RIGHT!\n\nRIGHT",

LEFT/DOWN are safer in terms of immediate branching (3 options), but they don\u2019t nab a high-value apple as quickly.\n- Opponent (head at 7,4) is nowhere near to contest or force a head-on this turn, so pushing toward the (9,8) apple is low-risk and high-reward.\n\nShort-term plan (this will be your next-turn rationale):\n- Move RIGHT now to (7,8).

We took a bit of a scare last turn, letting S0 sneak ahead in length thanks to some dodgy internal logic about my growth, but we established the TRUE state: S0 is length 5, I am length 4, heading to (7, 4) after chasing that apple! I MISSED the growth calculation on my end, but that doesn't matter now! We recover NOW!\n\n**CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT (T=5 Result):**\nMY SNAKE (ID 1): Head (7, 4). Body [(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)]. Length 4. (Assuming I ate, Score should be 4, Length 5 if I ate! If I didn't eat, my tail should have fallen off, body [(6, 4), (5, 4)]! Since the provided body is 3 segments long, I MUST assume I ATE, and my length is 4, meaning my T4 apple score was 3 before the move, and now 4 AFTER the growth! My length counting system is: Segments + Head = Total Length. Length 4 means 3 segments + Head. Score 4 means 3 segments + Head. Wait, the score increases by 1 per apple. If score is 4, it should mean 4 segments + Head = Length 5 IF I ATE THIS TURN! UGH, this state is CLUNKY!\n\nLet's use the S0 data, which is cleaner: S0 has 4 apples, Length 5 (4 segments + Head).\nIf S0 is Length 5 with 4 apples, it means they ATE on T4.\nIf I have 4 apples (Scoreboard 4), I should also be Length 5 if I ATE on T4.\nThe board shows my body is [(6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4)]. That's 3 segments. Total Length 4. This implies I ATE, but my tail from 2 turns ago didn't fall off because I ATE? No, if you eat, your tail stays!\n\n**STRICT ASSUMPTION:**\nMy list of body segments is the defining feature for collision detection.\nMy current length is 4 cells total (Head + 3 Body segs).\nS0's current length is 5 cells total (Head + 4 Body segs). **S0 LEADS BY LENGTH!**\n\nI need to EAT this turn (T6) to match their length!\n\n**Target Apples:** (7, 3) and (8, 4).\n\n**My Moves from (7, 4):**\n1. **UP to (7, 5):** Safe. Post-move length = 4 (Tail falls).\n2. **DOWN to (7, 3):** **EAT (7, 3)! GROW! New Length 5!** Success!\n3. **LEFT to (6, 4):** Collision with my own body! **DEAD! VETO LEFT!** (My body starts at (6, 4)).\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 4):** **EAT (8, 4)! GROW! New Length 5!** Success!\n\n**S0's Moves from (6, 8):** Body [(6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)]. Tail segment is (8, 8).\n1. **UP to (6, 9):** Collision with body! **DEAD! VETO UP!**\n2. **DOWN to (6, 7):** Safe. New body ends at (7, 8) (if they don't eat).\n3. **LEFT to (5, 8):** Safe.\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 8):** Safe.\n\nS0 has three safe moves. I have two guaranteed growth moves! I MUST take the growth!\n\n**Comparing (7, 3) vs (8, 4):**\nGoing to (8, 4) puts me on the right side, maximizing space between me and S0 who is currently top-right constrained. If S0 moves DOWN to (6, 7), I gain separation and claim territory toward the right-side wall. If S0 moves LEFT to (5, 8), they start trying to snake back towards the left side of the board, and I'm already positioned well on the right.\n\nGoing to (7, 3) moves me down towards the large cluster of apples at the bottom (y=0 to y=3). This is a good long-term play for securing the next cycle of food. Plus, (7, 3) is right next to an opponent's tail if they move DOWN!\n\nLet's check collision risk if I go (8, 4) and S0 goes (6, 7) (DOWN):\nMy Head (8, 4), S0 Head (6, 7). No collision. I grow to 5. They stay 5 (no eat). I take the lead in future engagement!\n\nLet's check collision risk if I go (7, 3) and S0 goes (6, 7) (DOWN):\nMy Head (7, 3), S0 Head (6, 7). No collision. I grow to 5. They stay 5 (no eat).\n\nThis is tight! I like going right because it forces S0 to play defensively or attempt to drop down towards the bottom section where I have a harder time maneuvering. Taking (8, 4) feels like asserting control over the middle-right quadrant.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T6-T7):** Secure length parity NOW by eating (8, 4). Then, use the resulting position on the right side to threaten boxing S0 against the top wall or forcing them towards the center line if they try to retreat south. If they drop south, I chase them down to mop up the bottom cluster while maintaining superior position on the higher ground.\n\nGotta get that W! I'm feeling the RIGHT move!\n\nRIGHT",

They can\u2019t contest (9,8) fast enough to beat us.\n- RIGHT is the most aggressive high-value play: we can be on (9,8) by turn+1 and pick up an apple to break the 4-4 tie. It also keeps good follow-ups (from 8,8 we can go RIGHT to eat or drop into the open space below if needed).\n- DOWN is safer for space but slower to apples and loses tempo on that juicy (9,8).\n\nShort-term plan (for the next rationale clip):\n- Move RIGHT to (8,8) this turn.

Tail is (7, 9), but the list is HEAD-TO-TAIL, so the last segment is (7, 9), but the segment that *will* fall off is the one that hasn't been replaced by growth, which is the one *behind* (7, 9). Given the length 5, their tail is the 5th segment listed: (7, 9) is the tail *if they didn't eat last turn*. If they didn't eat, the tail segment (7, 9) will move out, revealing the space behind it. Let's assume standard game logic: their tail is the *last* element: (7, 9).\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 9):** (8, 9) is free space. (6, 9) is in their body, (7, 9) is their tail. Safe zone.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 7):** Safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 8):** **DANGER!** (7, 8) is their body segment! **VETO LEFT!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 8):** **APPLE! (9, 8) is an apple!** If S0 goes RIGHT, they eat!\n\n**DANGER ZONE ANALYSIS - COLLISIONS:**\n1.  **Me UP (9, 5) vs S0:** S0 can go UP (8, 9), DOWN (8, 7), or RIGHT (9, 8-Apple). No collision.\n2.  **Me DOWN (9, 3) vs S0:** S0 can go UP (8, 9), DOWN (8, 7), or RIGHT (9, 8-Apple). No collision.\n\n**APPLE/STRATEGY EVALUATION:**\nI am boxed against the right wall. I MUST move UP or DOWN to survive.\nThe best apple remaining in my immediate vicinity is **(9, 8)**, which is adjacent to S0's head's potential move RIGHT!\n\n**Option A: I move UP to (9, 5).**\nS0 sees (9, 8) apple. If S0 chooses RIGHT to (9, 8), they eat and grow to Length 6 immediately, pulling ahead again! I need to block this!\n\n**Option B: I move DOWN to (9, 3).**\nS0 still has the option to go RIGHT to (9, 8) and eat!\n\n**I MUST move to a location that either blocks S0's move to (9, 8), or beats them to a crucial junction.**\n\nSince S0 is currently at (8, 8) and I am at (9, 4), S0's *closest* move to me is not immediate. They are focused on the top right apple (9, 8).\n\nIf I go UP to (9, 5), I try to get above the fray and might line up for the (9, 8) apple next turn if S0 moves away from it.\nIf S0 goes RIGHT to (9, 8), they grow to L6. Their body shifts: Head (9, 8), Tail moves from (7, 9). New Tail segment is (6, 9) moving out if they didn't grow before, but since they are L5, their tail segment (7, 9) will move out!\n\nIf S0 eats (9, 8): New Head (9, 8). New Body: [(8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9)]. Length 6! S0 pulls ahead again!\n\n**I CANNOT LET S0 EAT (9, 8)!**\n\nMy safe moves are (9, 5) UP or (9, 3) DOWN. Neither directly blocks (9, 8).\n\nHow can I position myself such that if S0 moves RIGHT to (9, 8), I can move to block their path or grab an apple they MUST pass through? If S0 eats (9, 8), they become L6. I need to eat too next turn!\n\nIf I go **UP to (9, 5)**: This starts moving me north, positioning me better to intercept the high-value apples like (3, 9) later, or getting closer to S0 if they retreat into the center. It keeps me away from the low ground where S0 might try to trap me later.\n\nIf S0 is smart, they WILL go RIGHT to **(9, 8)** and eat. They become L6, I remain L5.\nTurn 8 planning: S0 is in the corner at (9, 8). I am at (9, 5). S0's body will sprawl away from the corner. I am now positioned perfectly to move UP to (9, 6) or (9, 7) assuming their head moves up or left/right.\n\nIf I go **DOWN to (9, 3)**: This moves me towards the messy bottom section. If S0 eats (9, 8), they are L6 in the corner. I am L5 at the bottom. They have a massive positional advantage if I go down.\n\n**Conclusion:** Going UP [(9, 5)] is the least bad option. It prioritizes central/high ground movement, setting up potential counter-strikes or defense if S0 boxes themselves into the corner by eating the apple there. I need to prepare for a length deficit *next* turn if S0 is smart.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T7-T8):** Accept that S0 might secure the (9, 8) apple and take the lead in length (L6 vs L5). My priority is to stay alive in this cramped right side while positioning myself to quickly intercept the central/upper apples like (3, 9) or (4, 6) next cycle. By moving UP to (9, 5), I am using the wall to shield my movement and preparing to maneuver either left or further up if S0 stays cornered. Must avoid the LEFT move at all costs next turn!\n\nMoving UP!\n\nUP",

We just survived Turn 7, trying to make sense of the chaotic board state they dumped on us. We are LENGTH 5, they are LENGTH 5 (for now, but they look like they ate last turn based on the length growth implied by the state visualization, even if the scoreboard didn't update instantly!).\n\n**Current State Recap:**\nMy Head: (9, 4). Body: [(8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (5, 4)]. Stuck to the right wall.\nS0 Head: (8, 8). Body sprawling top-right.\nCrucial Apple: (9, 8) RIGHT above S0's head, tempting them mightily.\n\n**Safety Check AGAIN (From (9, 4)):**\n1. UP to (9, 5): SAFE.\n2. DOWN to (9, 3): SAFE.\n3. LEFT to (8, 4): **SUICIDE!** (Into my own body segment (8, 4)). VETO!\n4. RIGHT: OFF MAP! VETO!\n\nWe are forced UP or DOWN. We MUST anticipate S0 making the smart move: RIGHT to (9, 8) and eating! If S0 eats, they go L6, we stay L5. We get played if we don't react smartly to this.\n\n**If S0 Goes RIGHT to (9, 8) (EATS):**\nS0 Head: (9, 8). S0 becomes aggressive L6, likely trapping the top edge.\nIf **I GO UP to (9, 5)**: I continue advancing along the wall, keeping my options open for moving LEFT next turn if S0 is now effectively blocked into the corner by their own growth, or moving further UP to intercept central high apples. This feels like the proactive move, setting up a chase. If I move up, I am trying to maintain parity in positional threat, even if I lose a length point.\n\nIf **I GO DOWN to (9, 3)**: I run toward the chaotic lower quadrant. If S0 eats (9, 8), they are L6 UP TOP, and I am trapped DOWN LOW. S0 dictates the pace, and I am immediately in a poor defensive position for centralization. NO THANKS!\n\n**STRATEGY: GO UP, PREPARE FOR THE LENGTH DIFFERENCE.**\nWe are accepting the potential L6 vs L5 scenario for this turn, banking on the fact that moving UP gives us better positioning against the central board control while S0 buries itself in the corner eating that apple. Next turn, we need to look for a major apple win or try to box S0 if their growth pattern leaves an opening. We stay alive, we stay aggressive, we look North!\n\n**LONG TERM NOTE:** If S0 eats (9, 8), prepare to snake LEFT on Turn 8, aiming for the center line (around Y=5/6) while S0 is still consolidating their top-right position.

Content and survival, baby.  \n- Minimal short-term collision risk; we can react next turn to opponent movement and avoid a head-on if they try to contest the column.\n\nShort-term plan (for next rationale clip): Push down the right column to y\u22483, then pivot LEFT into the bottom cluster of apples (7,3; 8,3; 7,1; 8,0; 9,0) while always keeping two escape options. If opponent tries to contest the column, don't trade a head-on \u2014 kite and take the flank apples.\n\nLet's get that apple-hunting momentum and keep stacking points. You ready? LET'S GO!\n\nDOWN",

Let's see the fallout!\n\n**Board State Check:**\nMy Head: (9, 6).\nLast Move: UP (from (9, 5) to (9, 6)). Okay, my rationale analysis for the *previous* turn placed my head at (9, 4), but the actual resulting head position *after* Turn 8's UP move must be (9, 6) as shown now. Phew, consistency is key! My body grew! Length check: I am now Length 5 (4 apples + 1 starting length).\nS0 Head: (9, 7). Body: [(9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9)]. Apples: 5.\nWait, S0's body suggests they *ate* (9, 8) OR the board state display is slightly lagging behind the score. If they have 5 apples, they *should* be Length 6 if they ate on Turn 8. Let's look at their body count: 5 segments listed + head = 6 total length! YES! S0 ate that apple! They are LENGTH 6, we are LENGTH 5! Darn it! They are winning the growth battle! \ud83d\ude21\n\nSo, on Turn 8, S0 moved to (9, 8) and grew! I moved to (9, 6).\n\n**Current Locations & Targets:**\nMy Head: (9, 6)\nS0 Head: (9, 7)\nApples near me/us:\n(7, 1), (3, 6), (4, 6), (2, 0), (9, 0), (0, 0), (1, 3), (8, 3), (3, 9), (7, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (1, 0), (0, 6), (8, 0)\n\nThe closest apples are generally low down or scattered. The high ground is stripped clean near us now! We are hugging Wall 9.\n\n**Safety Analysis from (9, 6):**\n1. **UP to (9, 7): DANGER ZONE!** This is S0's head position! Head-on collision potential if S0 stays put or moves the wrong way, but we must check if S0 moves *away* from us.\n2. **DOWN to (9, 5): SAFE.** This is my body segment. VETO! Wait, my body is [(9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4)]. Yes, (9, 5) is my immediate tail, moving there is hitting myself! **SUICIDE!** \ud83d\udc80\n3. **LEFT to (8, 6): SAFE.** This moves us off the wall towards the center 8-column.\n4. **RIGHT:** Off map! VETO!\n\nWhoa! We are seriously boxed in! We can only move LEFT to (8, 6) or face S0 head-on at (9, 7).\n\n**Enemy Prediction (S0 at (9, 7)):**\nS0 just grew to L6. They are controlling the top right corner. They might want to move LEFT to (8, 7) to start creeping along the top edge, or maybe DOWN towards the chaos below.\n\n**Collision Check if I move UP to (9, 7):**\nIf S0 moves UP to (9, 8) (off map if their body segment is still there but we can assume they keep moving), DOWN to (9, 6), LEFT to (8, 7), or RIGHT (off map).\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (9, 6) -> **DOUBLE KO! We both die!** This is the worst outcome if we want to win! We must avoid this intersection!\n\n**Must Avoid (9, 7) and (9, 6) interaction.**\n\n**Safe Moves Recap:**\n*   LEFT to (8, 6): This is the ONLY non-suicidal, non-collision move available!\n\n**Decision:** We are forced LEFT to (8, 6). This breaks us away from S0 who is positioned directly above us at (9, 7). This moves us away from the immediate threat and into the middle columns, opening up more escape paths for Turn 10. We are prioritizing survival over immediate apple acquisition since options are so limited here.\n\n**Strategy Note for Future Self:** We must dig deep now! S0 is bigger! We need to grab an apple fast to keep parity, or force S0 into a bad spot. Look towards the cluster of apples in columns 2-4, rows 0-4. We are now on Row 6, which is good for moving towards the center!\n\nLEFT it is! Let's see if S0 is dumb enough to try and head-butt us!\n\nLEFT",

We don\u2019t want to hand them the initiative to herd us.\n\nLong-term plan (next few turns): take LEFT now to (8,7), then push DOWN toward (8,3)/(7,3) apples while keeping lateral escape routes. Avoid hugging the right wall where opponent can limit our options. Keep our length manageable and prioritize reachable apples in the bottom cluster.\n\nLET'S GO FOR THE CONTENT \u2014 play it safe, keep options open, and keep stacking apples. LEFT",

We\u2019re still smaller, 4 apples to their 5, but we are ALIVE and that's what matters! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**Current State Check:**\nMy Head: (8, 6)\nMy Body: [(9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4)] (Wait, I need to reconstruct my body from the last move! Last move was from (9, 6) LEFT to (8, 6). My body was [(9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4)]. If I didn't eat, my tail drops off. My body structure is [Head, B1, B2, B3, B4]. After moving LEFT to (8, 6), my new body should be [(9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4)]. If the game *doesn't* reveal the tail drop immediately, I need to assume my length is still 5 segments + head = 5 apples. Let's re-read the setup: \"Snake lists are HEAD-TO-TAIL: first tuple is the head, each one connects to the previous, last one is the tail.\"\nMy body listed: [(9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4)]. That's 4 segments. 4 apples + starting body = 5 total segments. Okay, my length is 5. The tail segment at (8, 4) will drop unless I eat.\n\nS0 Head: (8, 7). Body: [(9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8)], Apples: 5. Length 6. They also didn't eat last turn, so their tail at (6, 9) should drop!\n\n**Apple Check:** Tons of apples down low! (7, 1), (3, 6), (4, 6), (2, 0), (9, 0), (0, 0), (1, 3), (8, 3), (3, 9), (\n7, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (1, 0), (0, 6), (8, 0).\n\n**Target Acquisition:** We are at (8, 6). We need to move down and left to scoop up the lower apples, especially those near column 3/4. (8, 3) looks tempting, but that's a long journey. (7, 3) is also available if we get below row 6 fast.\n\n**Safety from (8, 6):**\nMy Body: [(9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4)] - I cannot move to (9, 6) (head collision risk from previous position) or (8, 5) (if I move DOWN, that's backwards into my hypothetical incoming tail cell if I didn't eat). Since I moved LEFT, my *old* head position (9, 6) is now my new B1, and my *old* B4 ((8, 4)) is the segment that *should* drop unless I ate.\n*   UP to (8, 7): S0 is currently at (8, 7)! \ud83d\ude31 **IMMEDIATE SUICIDE/DOUBLE KO!** VETO!\n*   DOWN to (8, 5): This is safe *unless* S0's tail dropped and is now at (8, 5). S0's tail was at (6, 9). If they didn't eat, their new tail is (6, 8), not (8, 5). **SAFE MOVE.**\n*   LEFT to (7, 6): Very safe, moves us towards the center.\n*   RIGHT to (9, 6): This is my *old* head position! This is segment B1 of my new body! **HITTING MYSELF!** \ud83d\udc80 VETO!\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining:** DOWN (to (8, 5)) or LEFT (to (7, 6)).\n\n**Enemy Prediction (S0 at (8, 7)):**\nS0 is on row 7. They just moved from (9, 7) to (8, 7) last turn (assuming they moved LEFT to escape our potential path or move towards the center). They are L6. They will likely try to move DOWN towards the apples at (7, 3) or (8, 3) if they see us going for them, or they might move LEFT to (7, 7).\n\n**Comparing LEFT vs DOWN:**\n1.  **LEFT to (7, 6):** Puts us closer to the massive pile of apples around x=3, y=6/4. It starts our descent towards the action. It keeps us away from S0's immediate row 7.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 5):** This moves us onto their previous path/row. If S0 moves DOWN to (8, 6) in prediction of *us* moving there this turn, we'd collide on the next turn! If S0 moves LEFT to (7, 7), then moving DOWN to (8, 5) looks safer.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (7, 6):\n*   If S0 moves UP to (8, 8) -> Safe.\n*   If S0 moves DOWN to (8, 6) -> Collision risk next turn at (8, 6) if we both retreat there.\n*   If S0 moves LEFT to (7, 7) -> We occupy adjacent cells, good spread.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (8, 5):\n*   If S0 moves UP to (8, 8) -> Safe for now.\n*   If S0 moves LEFT to (7, 7) -> We are effectively boxed into a smaller area if we don't get the next apple.\n\nThe map is wide open below row 5. We need momentum downwards and leftwards to maximize apple access. Moving LEFT to (7, 6) seems the most proactive way to start moving into the core of the remaining apples while keeping S0 (at row 7) behind us. It's a horizontal pivot towards the action!\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Sink towards the center-left quadrant rapidly. Prioritize eating any apple in rows 1-4 to close the length gap with S0. Avoid wall hugging unless we are actively pursuing an apple in the corner. We look like we are setting up a diagonal dash towards (3, 6) or (4, 6) next turn if S0 doesn't block the path.\n\nI'm feeling a strong **LEFT** move here to claim some horizontal ground. Let's do this!\n\nLEFT",

They *must* be aiming for an apple soon, likely chasing the cluster near the top (3, 9) or coming down towards (7, 3).\n\n*   If S0 moves DOWN to **(8, 6)**: This blocks my path if I wanted to go there next turn, and traps me slightly if I go DOWN now.\n*   If S0 moves LEFT to **(7, 7)**: We collide if I go UP! If I go LEFT to (6, 6) or DOWN to (7, 5), we create parallel paths.\n*   If S0 moves UP to **(8, 8)**: This is a safe move for them, backing up.\n\nWe are at (7, 6). The best loot is clearly in the lower left/center: (3, 6), (4, 6), (7, 3), (8, 3). We need to get lower!\n\n**Comparing LEFT (6, 6) vs DOWN (7, 5):**\n\n*   **LEFT (6, 6):** Keeps us on Row 6. We are setting up perfectly to shoot down towards (6, 3) or (5, 3) next turn to nab the sweet apples there. It also lets us watch S0 if they move LEFT to (7, 7) or UP to (8, 8).\n*   **DOWN (7, 5):** Puts us one step closer to the y=3 apples, but it might put us in the line of fire if S0 decides to dive down towards (8, 6) or (7, 6) (which is my old position, but S0 might not know precisely where my tail dropped).\n\nGoing **LEFT** feels more strategic right now. It keeps our horizontal options open and aligns us better with the (x $\\le$ 5) area where the competition is sparse. If S0 moves UP or LEFT, we are safe. If S0 moves DOWN to (8, 6), moving LEFT keeps us clear of the collision zones around column 8.\n\nMy gut says we need to start making serious diagonal progress towards those lower left apples. Left is the first step in that diagonal!\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Drive hard towards the center/bottom quadrant (x=[2, 5], y=[2, 5]). These are untapped goldmines. Use the existing board geometry (our current position (7, 6) and S0's (8, 7)) to force S0 upward or to the right while we sink down and left. Avoid Row 7 entirely for the next couple of turns unless necessary.\n\nFinal Decision: LEFT to (6, 6). Let's chew up map real estate!\n\nLEFT",

We're up against S0, they've got one more apple, but we are HUNGRY! \ud83d\ude24\n\nCurrent State Check (Turn 12):\n**MY HEAD: (6, 6)**\nMy Body: [(7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4)] (Assuming tail dropped if no apple eaten. Let's re-verify my length based on the original prompt body: [(7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5)]. Original body was 4 segments long plus head. If I ate last turn, I'm length 5, tail at (9, 4). If I DIDN'T eat, my tail dropped from (9, 5) position. Let's assume the standard rule: If I didn't eat last turn (and I didn't, the apple at (3, 6) is still there), my tail at (9, 5) from the previous state moved to where (9, 5) was, and the old tail is gone. Wait, the board state provided is based on Head (6, 6) and Body [(7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5)]. The previous state listed MY head at (7, 6) and body [(8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4)]. If I moved LEFT from (7, 6) to (6, 6), my old head (7, 6) becomes B1, my old B1 (8, 6) becomes B2, etc. My new tail is where my old tail segment *was*. The body list provided in the prompt is the *resulting* body after the move from Turn 11 which put my head at (6, 6).\n\nLet's reconcile the prompt's current state with the move I *said* I made last turn (LEFT from (7, 6) to (6, 6)).\nIf I was at (7, 6) and moved LEFT, my new body should be: [(7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5)]... wait, my length is 4, meaning 5 total cells. If the prompt shows Body: [(7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5)], that's only 4 body segments. That implies my length is 5 segments TOTAL (Head + 4 Body). If I didn't eat, my tail should have dropped off my previous T-1 body which was [(8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4)]. So my new body should be [(7, 6) OLD HEAD, (8, 6) OLD B1, (9, 6) OLD B2, (9, 5) OLD B3] and the old tail (9, 4) is gone! Okay, the provided board graphic seems to imply I have 4 body segments (length 5 total). Let's trust the BOARD STATE provided above for Turn 12:\n**MY HEAD: (6, 6). Body: [(7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5)]. Length 5.** Correct. This confirms I did NOT eat on Turn 11.\n\n**S0 Head: (6, 7). Body: [(7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8)]. Length 6.** S0 also did not eat on Turn 11.\n\n**Apple Check:** We are dangerously close to the massive (3, 6), (4, 6) cluster! And S0 is hanging right over it near (6, 7).\n\n**SAFETY CHECK FROM (6, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 7):** DANGER! S0 is currently at **(6, 7)** according to the board diagram! \ud83d\udca5 COLLISION IMMINENT if I try to go UP! **VETO!**\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 5):** Looks safe from my body [(7, 6), (8, 6), ...]. Moves us toward the bottom half of the board. **SAFE.**\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 6):** Moves us away from S0 and towards the left wall. Good maneuvering room. **SAFE.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 6):** That's my old head position (B1)! **HITTING MYSELF!** \ud83d\udc80 **VETO!**\n\n**Safe Candidates:** DOWN (6, 5) or LEFT (5, 6). We MUST avoid UP (6, 7) because S0 has claimed that spot!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION (S0 at (6, 7)):**\nS0 is perfectly positioned to dive down onto apple (4, 6) or (3, 6) next turn if we let them! They are blocking the main path to the cluster! They are looking for that apple or trying to trap us against the top wall.\n\n*   If S0 moves **DOWN to (6, 6)**: Head-on collision! But wait, *I'm* at (6, 6). If S0 moves DOWN to (6, 6), THEY die. Great!\n*   If S0 moves **LEFT to (5, 7)**: A safe escape/advance for them.\n*   If S0 moves **RIGHT to (7, 7)**: Also a safe advance.\n*   If S0 moves **UP to (6, 8)**: Backing up slightly.\n\nThe critical part is (6, 6) vs (6, 7) collision potential. If *both* snakes try to move into shared territory, we have problems. But if *I* move to (6, 7), S0 dies! And if S0 moves to (6, 6), they die!\n\n**Strategy:** S0 is right on top of us. We need to either force a collision where THEY die, or escape quickly to get access to the lower apples before S0 locks down the center.\n\n1.  **If I choose DOWN (6, 5):** I escape the immediate danger zone of Row 6/7. S0 will likely move LEFT (5, 7) or RIGHT (7, 7) to stay near the apples. This is a good retreat while positioning us for a dive down to (6, 3) or (5, 3) later.\n2.  **If I choose LEFT (5, 6):** This is a lateral dodge. We move toward the edge, giving us more safety room horizontally, but we might let S0 swoop down onto the (4, 6) apple uncontested.\n\nS0 is currently blocking both the UP movement and the RIGHT movement in a catastrophic way. We need to break free of this immediate confrontation boundary. Going DOWN (6, 5) seems like the best escape hatch, taking us to an area where we have more room to maneuver around the 'A's in the bottom half of the board without immediately running into an opponent segment or an opponent head!\n\nWe are aiming for (3, 6) and (4, 6). Going DOWN takes us farther away initially, but it avoids S0's immediate zone of control! I don't want to force a collision if I'm not 100% sure they won't sacrifice themselves *and* kill me in the process (e.g., if they try to move right into my body segment (7, 6)).\n\nLet's go **DOWN**. Clear the deck, let them fight amongst themselves for the top apples for a turn, and we pivot south!\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Drive hard for the untouched apples around X=[1-4], Y=[1-4]. Keep a watchful eye on S0's proximity to the wall. If S0 chases us down, we use our head start momentum to circle them or force them into an awkward corner near rows 8/9. We need to steal at least two apples this turn or next to catch up!\n\nDOWN\n\nP.S. If S0 moves UP to (6, 8), they are dodging our current position nicely. If S0 moves DOWN to (6, 6), RIP S0. If they move LEFT/RIGHT, we are safe at (6, 5) and ready to plot our southern invasion! Good luck, old friend! We secure the W!",
