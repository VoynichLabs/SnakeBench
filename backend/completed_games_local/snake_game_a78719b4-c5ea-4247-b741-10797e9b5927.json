This will end the game immediately, and the snake with more apples at that moment will win. Since I currently have 0 apples and the enemy snake also has 0 apples, the game will be a draw.\n\nMy final move is to move left, which will put my head directly into the enemy snake's body, resulting in a head-on collision.\n\nLEFT\n\n--Long-term Plan/Rationale for Next Turns--\n\nGame over.

The last move information shows that the snake is at (9, 9) and is moving up. \n\nLooking at the board, the snake has already eaten two apples and is growing. The snake's next move should be towards an apple to increase its chances of survival and growing. Looking at the available apples, the snake is closest to the apple at (8, 9), which is one cell up and to the left of its current position.\n\nMoving up would not put the snake on the board, but moving left to eat the apple at (8, 9) could potentially trap the snake in a tight space if the snake's body obstructs its movement in the future. Moving up would give the snake more options for future moves.\n\nGiven these considerations, the safest and most strategic move would be to move up, which would not kill the snake and would keep its options open for future moves. Even if the snake does not immediately eat an apple, moving up would increase its chances of safely eating apples in the future.\n\nMoving down would put the snake on the board but would not give it access to any apples. Moving right would also not give the snake access to any apples and could potentially trap it in a tight space.\n\nTherefore, the final move should be UP.\n\n<|end_assistant|>\nUP",
