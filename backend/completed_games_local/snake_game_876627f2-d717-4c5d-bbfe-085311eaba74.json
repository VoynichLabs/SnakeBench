Progresses toward (4,4) but requires an additional LEFT move afterward.\n- **DOWN**: Safe (5,2) with body [(5,3), (6,3)].

Safe move (no immediate collision), collects an apple (score increases to 2, health restored), and enables growth for future turns. Body becomes [(4,4), (3,4), (3,3)].\n\n**Decision**: RIGHT is the optimal choice. It safely collects an apple for immediate growth and points, avoids collisions, and maintains strategic mobility. This move keeps me centered vertically, allowing flexibility to pursue other apples (e.g., (5,8) or (4,1)) after strengthening. Prioritizing apple collection here gives a health and score boost, which is critical for long-term survival.\n\nRIGHT",

Move **DOWN** to (4,0) **now**.\n  2. Next turn, move **RIGHT** to (5,0), collecting the apple and increasing our score to 4 (matching the enemy\u2019s current count).\n  3. Proceed to collect the (6,0) apple by moving **RIGHT** to (6,1), then **DOWN** to (6,0).\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Moving **DOWN** first maximizes flexibility by opening both **LEFT** and **RIGHT** options for the next turn.\n- This path aligns with the immediate goal of collecting apples on row Y=0 while avoiding collision risks with the enemy snake (which is far above on Y=8).\n\n**Final Move:**  \n**DOWN**",
