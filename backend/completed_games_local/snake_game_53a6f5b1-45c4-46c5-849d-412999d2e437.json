This is a tight start, folks! We need to assert dominance and grab some early content (apples) while setting up a trap for this scrub! \ud83e\udd23\n\nLet's break down the board and our options. The board is 10x10. We are at (4, 4).\n\n**Our Immediate Goals:**\n1. Survive Turn 1. Duh!\n2. Get an apple. Gotta grow, gotta get those points!\n3. Control the center area and potentially push our rival into a corner.\n\n**Snake #1's Head:** (3, 3). He's hungry too!\n\n**Available Apples (A):**\nClosest ones are: (7, 3), (2, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (6, 5), (1, 5). And a bunch way down low and way up top!\n\nLet's analyze our possible moves from (4, 4):\n\n| Move | Destination | Collision/Danger Check | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (4, 5) | Safe - Empty cell. | Moves towards (6, 5), (9, 5). Good open space. |\n| DOWN | (4, 3) | Safe - Empty cell. | Moves towards (2, 3), (7, 3). Puts me close to Snake #1. |\n| LEFT | (3, 4) | Safe - Empty cell. | Closer to Snake #1, less direct apple access. |\n| RIGHT | (5, 4) | Safe - Empty cell. | Moves towards (6, 5), (9, 4). Good open space. |\n\nAll four moves are currently safe from walls and our own body (we have none). Now we need to consider Snake #1's response from (3, 3) and the apples.\n\n**Snake #1 (3, 3) Potential Moves:**\n\n1.  **UP (3, 4):** Closer to us (4, 4).\n2.  **DOWN (3, 2):** Towards (2, 3).\n3.  **LEFT (2, 3):** EATS AN APPLE! This is a high-priority move for him.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 3):** Directly towards our potential DOWN move (4, 3). Head-on collision risk if we both go there!\n\nIf Snake #1 goes LEFT to (2, 3), he eats an apple. That's a strong move for him.\n\nIf we go:\n*   **UP to (4, 5):** We are safe, aiming for the top right apples (6, 5) or (9, 5). Snake #1 is likely going LEFT (2, 3) or DOWN (3, 2). This keeps us away from immediate confrontation.\n*   **DOWN to (4, 3):** HIGH RISK! If Snake #1 goes RIGHT to (4, 3), we DIE in a head-on collision. If he goes LEFT (2, 3) or DOWN (3, 2), we are safe and eyeing (7, 3).\n*   **LEFT to (3, 4):** We are moving right next to his starting position. If he goes UP (3, 4), we DIE in a head-on collision. If he goes LEFT (2, 3), he eats the apple and we are boxing him in slightly.\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 4):** Safest open move. Aims for (6, 5) or (9, 4). Keeps distance while moving towards growth.\n\n**Strategy for Turn 1:**\nWe must assume our opponent is smart. Snake #1's most tempting move is LEFT to (2, 3) to get that apple immediately.\n\nIf Snake #1 goes LEFT (2, 3):\n*   If we go UP (4, 5): Safe. Good position for (6, 5).\n*   If we go DOWN (4, 3): Safe. Aims for (7, 3).\n*   If we go LEFT (3, 4): Safe. Adjacent to his path.\n*   If we go RIGHT (5, 4): Safe. Good position for (6, 5).\n\nThe riskiest moves are DOWN (4, 3) and LEFT (3, 4) because they risk immediate head-on collisions if Snake #1 decides to prioritize blocking or moving towards the center/right ((4, 3) or (3, 4) respectively) instead of taking the apple at (2, 3).\n\nRIGHT to (5, 4) or UP to (4, 5) seem like the most robust, collision-free opening moves, allowing us to pivot to a nearby apple on Turn 2.\n\nComparing UP and RIGHT:\n*   UP (4, 5) leads towards (6, 5) in 2 moves (by going RIGHT then UP/DOWN).\n*   RIGHT (5, 4) places us closer to (6, 5) (1 move UP, 1 move RIGHT, or 1 move RIGHT, 1 move UP).\n\nLet's pick RIGHT (5, 4). It sets us up beautifully to challenge for the center/right area, potentially forcing Snake #1 to chase or be confined to the bottom-left corner if he takes the (2, 3) apple. We are heading into open territory where there are several available apples relatively close by: (6, 5), (9, 4), (9, 5).\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next few turns):**\nWe are prioritizing safe growth on the right side of the board. T1: RIGHT to (5, 4). T2: Check opponent position, likely UP to (5, 5) or RIGHT to (6, 4) to aim for (6, 5) or (9, 4). We want to get big quickly and then use our body to block the smaller Snake #1. Control the center line (x=5/6) and push him West!\n\nLet's GO! We're taking the initiative! Taking RIGHT! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Let me break down what we're working with here \ud83d\udc40\n\n## THE SITUATION:\n- **Me (Snake #1)**: Head at (3, 3) - dead center, NO body yet \ud83d\udcaa\n- **Rival (Snake #0)**: Head at (4, 4) - one diagonal up-right from me\n- Board is 10x10, 150 turns to cook this guy, first to 30 apples or last one standing WINS \ud83c\udfc6\n\n## APPLE ANALYSIS \ud83c\udf4e:\nLet me scout these drops real quick:\n- **(2, 3)** - ONE CELL LEFT from my head! \ud83d\udc40 CLOSEST APPLE\n- **(1, 5)** - Two left, two up\n- **(9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 5)** - Right side, far away\n- **(6, 0), (6, 5)** - Mid-right area\n- **(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 9)** - Left side, edges\n- **(7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 6)** - Right side spread\n\n## DECISION TIME! \ud83c\udfae\n\nLet me check all four moves:\n\n**UP** (3, 4) - Safe \u2705 Moves away from rival's projected path\n**DOWN** (3, 2) - Safe \u2705 Also viable\n**LEFT** (2, 3) - **THAT'S THE APPLE SPAWN!** \ud83c\udfaf SAFE \u2705 INSTANT +1!\n**RIGHT** (4, 3) - Safe \u2705 But moves toward rival\n\nChat, do we even NEED to think about this?? \ud83d\ude24 We've got a FREE APPLE literally one step away at (2, 3)! That's content! That's a LEAD! That's momentum! \n\nThe rival is at (4, 4) - if they move DOWN or LEFT they might contest, but we're FASTER to (2, 3) from (3, 3). This is a no-brainer play to get +1, grow our snake, and establish dominance EARLY! \ud83d\ude80\n\n## LONG-TERM STRAT FOR NEXT TURN:\nOnce we grab that apple, we'll have a tail at (3, 3). Need to scout the next closest apples - looks like (2, 7) up-left and (1, 5) left are viable targets. Keep moving left side initially, box the rival on the right side of the board, and force HIM into a corner while we farm apples! Classic squeeze play! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nLet's GET IT! \n\nLEFT",

That scrub went LEFT and got the (2, 3) apple. We anticipated that, chat! We played it safe and moved RIGHT to (5, 4). Growth is the priority, but survival and positioning are key! We are at (5, 4), and he is now at (2, 3) with a tail at (3, 3).\n\n## Current Snake Positions:\n*   **A-Team (ID 0 / Us):** Head (5, 4). Length 1.\n*   **Rival (ID 1):** Head (2, 3). Body/Tail [(3, 3)]. Length 2.\n\nHe's got one up on us, but we have a dominant position on the board! Time to execute the next phase of the plan: aggressive apple acquisition and maintaining central control!\n\n## Available Moves from (5, 4):\n\n| Move | Destination | Collision/Danger Check | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| UP | (5, 5) | Safe. Good setup for (6, 5) or (9, 5). |\n| DOWN | (5, 3) | Safe. Moves towards (7, 3). |\n| LEFT | (4, 4) | Safe. Moving back towards him. |\n| RIGHT | (6, 4) | Safe. Excellent path to (9, 4) and (6, 5). Aggressive expansion. |\n\nAll moves are currently safe from walls and our own body. We need to analyze Snake #1's likely moves from (2, 3).\n\n## Snake #1 (2, 3) Potential Moves:\n\nHis immediate goal is probably another apple or getting out of the corner he's in.\n1.  **UP (2, 4):** Safe. Towards (1, 5).\n2.  **DOWN (2, 2):** Safe. Towards wall and corner.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 3):** Safe. Towards (0, 0) group later.\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 3):** DANGER! Collision with his own tail at (3, 3) if his tail doesn't move. *Wait, his tail is at T (3, 3) now. Since he grew, the tail is STILL (3, 3) until the next turn.* NO, wait a minute, since he just ATE, his tail *did not* move. So he is (2, 3) -> (3, 3). If he goes RIGHT to (3, 3), he hits his body and DIES.\n\n**Key Insight:** Since Snake #1 just ate, his body length increased, and his tail end (T) is still at (3, 3). Therefore, moving RIGHT to (3, 3) is a SUICIDE move for Snake #1. He absolutely cannot go RIGHT.\n\nSo, Snake #1 will be choosing between UP (2, 4), DOWN (2, 2), and LEFT (1, 3).\n\n**Our Strategy:** We need to capitalize on the open right side of the board and grab an apple to tie the score!\n\n1.  **If we go UP to (5, 5):** We are well positioned for the (6, 5) apple (2 moves away: R, U or U, R).\n2.  **If we go RIGHT to (6, 4):** Closer to the (9, 4) apple (3 moves away), and also very close to the (6, 5) apple (1 move UP). This is highly aggressive and secures the right half of the board early.\n\nGoing RIGHT (6, 4) is the most proactive move. It pushes us into the largest, most open space currently available, threatening two apples directly: (6, 5) and (9, 4).\n\nLet's look at potential threats if we go RIGHT to (6, 4):\n*   Snake #1 is constrained to the bottom left. He cannot reach us this turn. Collision risk is 0.\n\nThis is a power play, chat! We aim for the right side, forcing him to stay congested on the left.\n\n**Plan for the next few turns:**\nT1 (Current): RIGHT to (6, 4). Setup for (6, 5).\nT2: Likely UP to (6, 5) to grab the apple. *Assuming no head-to-head with a wall/body.*\nT3: Decide whether to go for (9, 4) or push down towards the bottom right apples (7, 2), (7, 0).\n\nLet's step on the gas and get this content! We're prioritizing the (6, 5) apple. Moving to (6, 4) ensures we can get it next turn by moving UP.\n\nLet's GOOOOO! We are playing chess while he's playing checkers! \ud83e\udd23\n\nRIGHT",

We just snagged that apple at (2,3) last turn - we're UP 1-0 against our rival! NOW we need to keep this momentum rolling and set up the LONG GAME! \n\n## CURRENT BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:\n\n**Our Snake (ID 1):**\n- Head: (2, 3)\n- Body: [(3, 3)] - just grew one segment, LET'S GO! \ud83d\udcaa\n- Apples: 1\n\n**Rival (Snake #0):**\n- Head: (5, 4)\n- Body: STILL empty - they haven't eaten YET! \n- Apples: 0\n\n## FOUR DIRECTIONS CHECK - LET'S GO THROUGH THEM:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (2, 4): Safe \u2705 No collision risk. Gets us toward (1, 5) apple!\n**DOWN** \u2192 (2, 2): Safe \u2705 No collision risk. Stays flexible.\n**LEFT** \u2192 (1, 3): Safe \u2705 No collision risk. Moves left side where multiple apples are.\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (3, 3): WAIT HOLD UP! \ud83d\udea8 That's our OWN BODY! Our tail is at (3, 3)! DEAD! \u274c Can't go right!\n\nSo we've got three safe options. Let me analyze the STRATEGIC PLAY here! \ud83c\udfae\n\n## APPLE DISTRIBUTION CHECK:\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n- **(1, 5)** - UP and LEFT from us! Super close! \ud83d\udccd\n- **(2, 7)** - Two up from (1, 5) \n- **(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 9)** - Left edge territory\n- **(9, 1), (9, 4), (9, 5)** - Far right (rival's domain)\n- **(6, 0), (6, 5), (7, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 6)** - Mid/right side\n\n## THE PLAY:\n\nI'm seeing (1, 5) as GOLDEN \ud83c\udf1f. It's only 2 moves away UP-LEFT from us! If we go **UP** now to (2, 4), next turn we can go LEFT to (1, 4), and THEN UP to (1, 5) - that's THREE apples in rapid succession if we chain left-side captures!\n\nMeanwhile, our rival at (5, 4) is FAR from these left-side apples. They'd need to move LEFT-UP to contest, but we can MAP OUT that territory FIRST and build our snake body to BOX THEM IN! Classic squeeze strategy! \ud83d\udd12\n\n## LONG-TERM GAME PLAN FOR NEXT 5 TURNS:\n\nTurn 2: UP to (2, 4) - setup position\nTurn 3: LEFT to (1, 4) - moving into left corridor\nTurn 4: UP to (1, 5) - GRAB THAT APPLE! \nTurn 5: Continue farming left side at (2, 7), (0, 9) if safe\nTurn 6: Establish border control - keep rival on RIGHT side while we OWN the left!\n\nThis way we grow our snake EARLY, get a size advantage, and FORCE the rival into a corner where they're competing for scraps on the right side! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nThe LEFT side is our TERRITORY now, chat! Let's go!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO, CHAT! Welcome back to the main event! We're on Turn 2, and the vibes are still high, even though Snake #1 has a slight lead with one apple. We just executed the T1 power play, moving RIGHT to (6, 4)! Let's check the current board state and plan the next phase of the BOX-IN-AND-CRASH-OUT strategy!\n\n## Current Board State Review:\n\n*   **A-Team (ID 0 / Us):** Head (6, 4). Length 1.\n*   **Rival (ID 1):** Head (2, 4). Body/Tail [(2, 3)]. Length 2.\n\nWait, hold up! Let's analyze Snake #1's move from Turn 1.\nLast turn, Snake #1 was at (2, 3) with a tail at (3, 3) (since he just ate). As we predicted, he couldn't go RIGHT.\nHe moved **UP** from (2, 3) to (2, 4)! That was a smart move, getting him out of the congestion and towards the (1, 5) apple. His new body is at (2, 3), and his tail is still at (2, 3) (it didn't move since he grew last turn).\n\n**Board Update:**\n- Snake 0 (Us) is at **(6, 4)**.\n- Snake 1 is at **(2, 4)**, with body at **(2, 3)**.\n\n## Our Strategy: Tie the Score and Dominate the Right Side!\n\nWe are at (6, 4). We have immediate access to the **(6, 5)** apple! This is a short-term, high-value target.\n\n## Analyzing Our Moves from (6, 4):\n\n| Move | Destination | Collision/Danger Check | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **UP** | **(6, 5)** (APP! A) | **SAFE.** We grab the apple, secure the score tie, and extend our influence North-East. \ud83d\udcb0 |\n| DOWN | (6, 3) | Safe. Moves us towards the bottom row, but away from better apples. |\n| LEFT | (5, 4) | Safe. Moves us back, opposite of aggressive expansion. |\n| RIGHT | (7, 4) | Safe. Moves us towards (7, 3) and (7, 2) clusters, but (6, 5) is better this turn. |\n\nThe move UP to (6, 5) is critical. It gives us our first apple and lengthens our body, which is crucial for boxing in the rival later.\n\n## Analyzing Snake #1's Target and Moves from (2, 4):\n\nSnake #1 is at (2, 4). His immediate targets are (1, 5) and (2, 7).\n1.  **UP (2, 5):** Safe. Towards (2, 7) and (1, 5). Aggressive movement.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 3):** DANGER! Collision with his own body/tail at (2, 3). He cannot move down!\n3.  **LEFT (1, 4):** Safe. Towards (1, 5) apple, setting up an easy grab next turn if he moves up.\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 4):** Safe. Gets him away from the corner, but away from apples.\n\nSnake #1's most probable moves are UP (2, 5) to set up for (2, 7), or LEFT (1, 4) to set up for (1, 5).\n\n## Collision Check:\n\nWe are moving to (6, 5). Snake #1 is confined to the left side of the board (max x=3) and is moving away from us. There is zero risk of a simultaneous head-to-head collision or hitting his body.\n\nThe plan is crystal clear, chat: **GO UP** and grab that apple! We tie the score, and then we pivot immediately to securing the (9, 4) or the (7, 6) apple depending on his movement.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T3-T5):**\n1.  **T2 (Current): UP** to (6, 5). Grab apple. We are now length 2.\n2.  **T3:** From (6, 5), if Snake #1 stays far left, we go RIGHT to (7, 5) or UP towards (7, 6).\n3.  **T4:** Secure a second apple, potentially (7, 6).\n\nThis is the move to get us back in the game!

We're UP 1-0 and the rival is still sitting at ZERO! \ud83d\ude24 This is OUR board right now!\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**Our Snake (ID 1):**\n- Head: (2, 4)\n- Body: [(2, 3)]\n- Apples: 1\n\n**Rival (Snake #0):**\n- Head: (6, 4)\n- Body: EMPTY - they're still just a head! \n- Apples: 0\n\nWe're positioned at (2, 4) and they're at (6, 4) - we're on the SAME ROW! This is CRUCIAL chat!\n\n## FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (2, 5): Safe \u2705 No board edges, no body collision. Moves us closer to that (1, 5) apple!\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (2, 3): WAIT HOLD UP! \ud83d\udea8 That's our OWN BODY! Our tail is at (2, 3)! Can't move backwards into ourselves - that's an INSTANT LOSS! \u274c\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (1, 4): Safe \u2705 Moves us toward the LEFT side apple corridor!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (3, 4): Safe \u2705 But... do we really WANT to go right toward the rival? Nah, that's their territory right now!\n\nSo we've got **UP** and **LEFT** as our true power moves here! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n## STRATEGY DEEP DIVE:\n\nThe rival is at (6, 4) with NO body yet. They're still vulnerable! But here's the thing - if we go RIGHT, we're moving TOWARD them on the same row. That's ASKING for a head-on collision later! We need to AVOID that lane!\n\nThe LEFT side has SO MANY apples waiting for us:\n- (1, 5) - just 1-2 moves away! \n- (2, 7) - a little further north\n- (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 9) - the entire LEFT EDGE is ours to farm!\n\nGoing **UP** to (2, 5) keeps us moving AWAY from the rival's current trajectory while positioning us PERFECTLY to pivot LEFT next turn and start our apple farming run! We stay flexible, we stay safe, and we KEEP CONTROL! \n\nThis is textbook BOARD CONTROL, chat! We're claiming the LEFT side as OUR TERRITORY while the rival has to scramble for scraps on the right! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n## NEXT 3-TURN MINI-PLAN:\n\nTurn 2 (NOW): UP to (2, 5) - positioning move\nTurn 3: LEFT to (1, 5) - GRAB THAT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\nTurn 4: UP to (1, 6) or continue farming left side - establish dominance!\n\nThe rival can't catch us on the left side. We're TOO FAST! Let's GOOOO!\n\nUP",

We are officially in the lead in momentum! \ud83d\ude24\n\n## Turn 3 Analysis: The Boxing Begins\n\nWe are LIVE at **(6, 5)**. Our body/tail is at **(6, 4)**. Length 2.\nSnake #1 is now at **(2, 5)**. His body/tail is at **(2, 4)**. Length 2.\n\n### What happened on T2? (Review the clip!)\n\n1.  **Our Snake (ID 0):** Moved $UP$ from (6, 4) $\\rightarrow$ **(6, 5)**. Ate the apple and grew! Score: 1.\n2.  **Rival (ID 1):** Moved $UP$ from (2, 4) $\\rightarrow$ **(2, 5)**. He\u2019s chasing that (1, 5) apple or setting up for the (2, 7)/(2, 8) area. His old body segment (2, 3) must have moved to (2, 4), and he grew, so his new body is at (2, 4). Score: 1.\n\nThe board state confirms this: We're both length 2, and both focused on expanding into our respective halves of the board. My half is richer in apples in the mid-to-high zone.\n\n## Our Strategy: Dominating the East Side and Setting the Trap!\n\nWe need to press our advantage. We are currently at (6, 5).\n\n### Our Targets (immediate/medium):\n\n1.  **(7, 6)**: Good apple, but a bit high.\n2.  **(9, 5)**: High-value apple, keeps us boxed in on the right edge.\n3.  **(7, 3)**, **(7, 2)**: Cluster down low.\n\nWe need to keep going RIGHT and UP now to claim the territory and establish a long path, essential for future boxing maneuvers!\n\n### Evaluation of Our Safe Moves from (6, 5):\n\n| Move | Destination | Collision Check | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **UP** | **(6, 6)** | **SAFE.** Puts us slightly away from dense apples, but central. |\n| **DOWN** | (6, 4) | **DANGER!** We hit our own body/tail! IMMEDIATE DEATH! \ud83d\udc80 (Cannot move into the previous head location when length > 1) |\n| **LEFT** | (5, 5) | **SAFE.** Moves us away from the right-side cluster, less optimal. |\n| **RIGHT** | **(7, 5)** | **SAFE.** Ideal move! Moves us towards the **(9, 5)** apple and gives us access to the **(7, 6)** and **(7, 7)** clusters next turn. This maximizes our territorial gain! \ud83d\udcc8 |\n\nThe choice is clearly between UP and RIGHT. **RIGHT to (7, 5)** is the most aggressively territorial move, setting us up perfectly for expansion.\n\n### Analyzing Rival's Potential Moves from (2, 5):\n\nSnake #1 is at (2, 5), body at (2, 4).\n1.  **UP (2, 6):** Targets (2, 7) and (0, 9). Strong move.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 4):** DANGER! Hits own body/tail. He dies!\n3.  **LEFT (1, 5):** **APPLE!** (1, 5). Most likely move. He ties the score immediately (if he didn't already eat it last turn, which he didn't).\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 5):** Less likely, as it moves away from all immediate apples.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 is almost certainly moving **LEFT** to (1, 5) to grab that apple and grow.\n\n### Collision Check:\n\nWe are moving to (7, 5).\nRival is likely moving to (1, 5).\nThere is zero risk of collision. We are maintaining our dominance on the right!\n\n## Long-Term Plan (T3-T6): The Eastern Bloc Formation\n\n1.  **T3 (Current): RIGHT** to (7, 5). Claim territory on the right flank.\n2.  **T4:** From (7, 5), move UP to (7, 6) or RIGHT to (8, 5) depending on where the (7, 6) apple is headed and the appearance of new apples. Aim for the (7, 6) or (9, 5) cluster.\n3.  **T5-T6:** Continue pathing on the right edge (x=7 to x=9) towards the (9, 5), (9, 4), and (7, 7) apples to build immense length. Once long enough, we cut hard left to trap him in the 0-1 column!\n\nWe must maintain the aggression! Secure the Eastern Bloc! \ud83c\udff0\n\nRIGHT",

But this is where GAME SENSE separates the GOATS from the COOKED players! \ud83c\udfae\n\n**LEFT to (1, 5)** = INSTANT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e We go 2-1! We EXTEND our lead! We get LONGER and STRONGER! Plus, the board shows that apple at (1, 5) is REAL! We're one move away from claiming it!\n\n**UP to (2, 6)** = Safety move, positioning, but no immediate apple grab. We'd have to take another turn to reach (2, 7).\n\nThe CHOICE is clear, fam! We LEFT to grab that apple and extend our dominance! The rival is at (6, 5) going... wherever they're going... but we're SECURING the LEFT CORRIDOR! This is BOARD CONTROL! \n\n## NEXT 3-TURN MINI-PLAN (FOR FUTURE ME):\n\nTurn 3 (NOW): LEFT to (1, 5) - GRAB THAT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Go 2-1!\nTurn 4: UP to (1, 6) - continue farming, move toward (2, 7) and (0, 9)!\nTurn 5: Continue the LEFT side farming loop - we're establishing a FORTRESS on the western edge!\n\nThe rival can't compete with our positioning! We're gonna make them CRASH OUT trying to keep up! Let's GOOOOOO!\n\nLEFT",

Let's check the scoreboard and the board state!\n\nTurn: 4 / 150. Time is flying!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:**\n*   Your Snake (ID 0) apples: 1\n*   Snake #1 apples: 2 \ud83e\udd2f WAIT, WHAT?!\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS (T4 START):**\nWe are at **(7, 5)**. Body segment is at (6, 5). Length 2.\nSnake #1 is at **(1, 5)**. Body segments are at (2, 5), (2, 4). Length 3.\nThe board state confirms the unexpected: Snake #1 grabbed the apple at (1, 5)! He is now leading 2-1 and is length 3. This changes things! We need to react FAST!\n\n 9 A . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . A . . . . A . .\n 6 . . . . . . . A . .\n 5 . . . . . . . 0 . A <- Head 1 here on the left, Head 0 here on the right!\n 4 . . T . . . . . . A\n 3 . . . . . . . A A .\n 2 . . . . . . . A . .\n 1 A . . . . . . . . A\n 0 A . . . . A A A . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSnake #1's path must have been (2, 5) $\\rightarrow$ (1, 5) *eating the apple*. His new body is (2, 5), (2, 4).\n\n## Turn 4 Strategy: Aggressive Apple Acquisition!\n\nThe pressure is ON! We need to extend our length quickly so we can execute the boxing maneuver. Length advantage means we control more space.\n\nOur head is at **(7, 5)**. Our body is at (6, 5).\n\n### Our Safe Moves from (7, 5):\n\n1.  **UP (7, 6):** **APPLE! (7, 6)** This is the immediate target! Grabbing this ties the score for apples and increases our length to 3, matching Snake #1. This is HUGE!\n2.  **DOWN (7, 4):** SAFE. Moves away from apples, less optimal.\n3.  **LEFT (6, 5):** **DANGER!** We hit our own body/tail! IMMEDIATE DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 5):** SAFE. Puts us in position for (9, 5) next turn, which is also an apple. Good, but UP is an immediate guaranteed apple.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving **UP to (7, 6)** is absolutely the strongest move. We must tie the score and gain length!\n\n### Analyzing Rival's Potential Moves from (1, 5):\n\nSnake #1 is at (1, 5). Body is (2, 5), (2, 4). He\u2019s long now!\n\n1.  **UP (1, 6):** Safe, sets up for (0, 9) or moves into the empty center.\n2.  **DOWN (1, 4):** Safe, but moves away from high-density areas.\n3.  **LEFT (0, 5):** Safe, moves towards the edge and the (0, 9) apple. Very strong.\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 5):** **DANGER!** Hits his own body! He dies!\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 will likely go **LEFT (0, 5)** towards the (0, 9) cluster, or **UP (1, 6)** to establish vertical dominance on the left. Either way, he is far from us.\n\n### Collision Check:\n\nWe are moving to (7, 6) to eat an apple.\nRival is highly unlikely to reach this location. Even if he moved RIGHT every single turn, it would require 6 moves just to reach (7, 5), and thus 7 moves to reach (7, 6).\n\nThe path is clear! We match his length and tie the score! Let's GO!\n\n## Revised Long-Term Plan (T4-T7): Length and Edge Control\n\n1.  **T4 (Current): UP** to (7, 6). Eat apple. Length 3. Score 2-2.\n2.  **T5:** From (7, 6), we should aim for the cluster nearby: (7, 7) or (9, 5). Moving **RIGHT** to (8, 6) seems like a good path towards (9, 5).\n3.  **T6-T7:** Secure the (9, 5) and (9, 4) apples on the eastern border to build up maximum length along the right edge. Once we hit Length 5 or 6, we can start cutting across the middle to dictate terms and eventually trap the poor rival on the left side of X=4! \ud83d\ude08\n\nWe need to catch up on length before we can box him in. This is critical survival and strategy!\nUP",

We're now sitting at 2 apples to their 1! But hold up... let me check the current board state because something feels OFF!\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**Our Snake (ID 1):**\n- Head: (1, 5) \u2705\n- Body: [(2, 5), (2, 4)]\n- Apples: 2 (WE'RE UP!)\n\n**Rival (Snake #0):**\n- Head: (7, 5)\n- Body: [(6, 5)]\n- Apples: 1\n\nOkay okay okay... we're STILL ahead but I gotta be real with chat - the rival ate an apple between turn 3 and now! They grew! They're at (7, 5) with a tail at (6, 5). We need to stay SHARP and not slip up!\n\n## FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (1, 6): Safe \u2705 Empty space! No apples directly there, but continues north toward (0, 9) apple territory! Opens up future plays!\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (1, 4): Safe \u2705 Empty space! Moves us toward the (0, 0) and (0, 1) apple corridor! More farming potential!\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (0, 5): Safe \u2705 Empty space! Pushes us to the EDGE of the board! This is that western fortress lockdown! But watch out - we're getting close to the boundary!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 5): \ud83d\udea8 THAT'S OUR OWN BODY! We can't go backwards into (2, 5)! Our body is literally RIGHT THERE! Instant death! Can't throw like that! \u274c\n\n## STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:\n\nAlright chat, we got THREE safe moves here! Let me think about positioning and apple access:\n\n**LEFT to (0, 5)** = Takes us to the edge! We lock down the LEFT corridor even MORE! But we're getting boxed in on one side - gotta be careful we don't trap ourselves!\n\n**DOWN to (1, 4)** = Moves us toward the (0, 0), (0, 1), (5, 0) apple cluster! Those are JUICY targets! We continue farming the southern left region!\n\n**UP to (1, 6)** = Moves toward (2, 7) and (0, 9) apples! Opens up the upper left quadrant! More breathing room!\n\nHere's the GAME SENSE moment, fam: We're UP 2-1, but the rival is GROWING too! We can't get complacent! The best move keeps our OPTIONS OPEN while moving us toward multiple apples!\n\n**UP to (1, 6)** is the PLAY! Why? Because:\n1. It opens up MULTIPLE apple paths - we can pivot toward (2, 7) OR (0, 9)!\n2. It keeps us in the center-left area where we have FLEXIBILITY!\n3. We're not boxing ourselves into a corner like going LEFT would!\n4. The rival is on the RIGHT side at (7, 5) - we're creating DISTANCE!\n\nThis is BOARD CONTROL, chat! We're staying unpredictable while farming!\n\n## NEXT 3-TURN MINI-PLAN:\n\n**Turn 4 (NOW):** UP to (1, 6) - continue north, farm safely, maintain flexibility!\n**Turn 5:** Depending on rival position, either LEFT to (0, 6) or UP to (1, 7) - keep that northern push going!\n**Turn 6:** Target either (2, 7) or (0, 9) apples - we're in POSITION to dominate!\n\nLet's GO!

The battlefield is taking shape, and it's time to execute Phase Two: Eastern Domination!\n\nTurn: 5 / 150. We are in the thick of it!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:**\n*   Your Snake (ID 0) apples: 2 (LET'S GOOO!)\n*   Snake #1 apples: 2 (Tied up, baby! We match his energy!)\n\n**SNAKE LOCATIONS:**\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):** Head at **(7, 6)**. Body segments: (7, 5), (6, 5). Length 3.\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 1):** Head at **(1, 6)**. Body segments: (1, 5), (2, 5). Length 3.\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\nSnake #1 seems to have continued UP from (1, 5) to (1, 6) after eating. This confirms he is aiming for the northern region while we control the southeast. PERFECT! The distance between us is massive (6 cells horizontally), so we can focus entirely on farming and growing our length right now.\n\n 9 A . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . A . . . .

To do that, we need more apples now!\n\nOur head is at **(7, 6)**. Our body is (7, 5), (6, 5).\n\n### Our Safe Moves from (7, 6):\n\n1.  **UP (7, 7):** **APPLE!** This is a guaranteed apple, tying us for the lead and extending us to length 4! We establish our high ground! \ud83d\udcc8\n2.  **DOWN (7, 5):** **DANGER!** We hit our own body segment! IMMEDIATE DEATH! \ud83d\udc80 (This is moving backward, remember!)\n3.  **LEFT (6, 6):** **APPLE!** Also an immediate apple grab! This is excellent too.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 6):** SAFE. Puts us in position for (9, 5) or (8, 7) later, but it misses immediate apples.\n\n### Comparing UP vs. LEFT (Apple vs. Apple):\n\n*   **Move UP to (7, 7):** Secures the immediate apple. Positions us perfectly to move RIGHT next turn to (8, 7) or DOWN-RIGHT towards (9, 5). This keeps us moving vertically along a high traffic lane (X=7).\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 6):** Secures the immediate apple. Moves us closer to the center, putting us in a better position to head for (2, 7) or the X=5/6 cluster later.\n\nBoth are guaranteed apples. Which one gives us a better follow-up?\n\nIf we go **UP to (7, 7)**:\nNext potential moves: (8, 7) (Safe, moves toward (9, 5) apple), (7, 8) (Safe, keeps us high). This maintains our pressure on the eastern wall.\n\nIf we go **LEFT to (6, 6)**:\nNext potential moves: (5, 6) (Safe, center control), (6, 7) (Safe, moves toward (2, 7) apple). This pulls us slightly more central.\n\n**Decision:** Since our primary strategy is to dominate the eastern boundary first, moving **UP to (7, 7)** aligns perfectly with the plan to secure (9, 5) and (9, 4) in the next few turns. This keeps our snake coiled on the right side of the board and maximizes our blocking potential later. We want maximum separation from Snake #1 right now!\n\n### Rival Prediction Check:\nSnake #1 is at (1, 6). Body is (1, 5), (2, 5).\nSafest moves for him are (0, 6) or (1, 7). Given the (0, 9) apple, he's likely moving toward the Northwest corner. No risk of collision.\n\nWe secure another apple, get to length 4, and start Phase Two! Let's GO!\n\n## Long-Term Plan (T5-T8): The Eastern Blitz\n\n1.  **T5 (Current): UP** to (7, 7). Eat apple. Length 4. Score 3-2. (We are winning!)\n2.  **T6:** Move **RIGHT** to (8, 7). Start traversing toward the corner.\n3.  **T7:** Move **DOWN** to (8, 6).\n4.  **T8:** Move **RIGHT** to **(9, 6)** (or (9, 5) if we can swing it tighter). Secure the (9, 5) apple, setting us up to control the entire X=9 column.\n\nWe maximize length while the opponent is distracted in the NW corner.\n\nUP",

We got the whole western corridor locked down, they're stuck on the east! \n\n## FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (1, 7): Safe \u2705 Empty space! Moves us toward (2, 7) apple! That's LITERALLY one cell away diagonally! We can pivot and GRAB IT next turn! This opens up the northern route!\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (1, 5): \ud83d\udea8 THAT'S OUR OWN BODY! Our body is literally RIGHT THERE at (1, 5)! Instant death! Can't throw like that! \u274c\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (0, 6): Safe \u2705 Empty space! Pushes us to the WESTERN EDGE! Maximum board control! But limits our flexibility after...\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 6): Safe \u2705 Empty space! Moves us closer to center! But why would we move TOWARD the rival?? They're at (7, 6)! We'd be moving TOWARD their territory! Not ideal!\n\n## STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:\n\nAlright chat, we got TWO truly viable moves here: **UP to (1, 7)** or **LEFT to (0, 6)**!\n\n**LEFT to (0, 6)** = Pure LOCKDOWN! We edge to the western wall! Maximum territorial control! But here's the thing - we're creating a potential dead-end for ourselves. If we keep going left and up, we box ourselves into the corner at (0, 9)! That's a TRAP!\n\n**UP to (1, 7)** = THIS IS IT, CHAT! Here's why:\n1. We're moving DIRECTLY toward the (2, 7) apple! That's one diagonal move away!\n2. Next turn we can pivot RIGHT to (2, 7) and GRAB IT! +1 apple, we're UP 3-2!\n3. We keep the CENTER-LEFT territory while maintaining ESCAPE ROUTES!\n4. We're not boxing ourselves into the corner - we're staying FLEXIBLE!\n5. The rival is STUCK on the east side at (7, 6)! They can't shadow us effectively!\n\nThis is BOARD CONTROL meets APPLE FARMING! We're creating a SPEED ADVANTAGE! While they're rotating around their side, we're FARMING our northern corridor!\n\n## NEXT 3-TURN MINI-PLAN:\n\n**Turn 5 (NOW):** UP to (1, 7) - move toward (2, 7) apple, keep flexibility!\n**Turn 6:** RIGHT to (2, 7) - GRAB that apple! We're up 3-2!\n**Turn 7:** Pivot DOWN or UP depending on rival position - farm the (0, 9) or cycle back toward (5, 0) corridor!\n\nThe rival's stuck farming the right side! We got the TEMPO! We got the POSITIONING! We're about to PULL AWAY! Let's GO! \ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Look at the scoreboard\u2014we are CRUSHING IT! \ud83d\udcc8\n\nTurn: 6 / 150. Time to press the advantage and get position for the next set of apples!\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:**\n*   Your Snake (ID 0) apples: 3 (WE'RE WINNING!)\n*   Snake #1 apples: 2\n\n**SNAKE LOCATIONS:**\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):** Head at **(7, 7)**. Body segments: (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5). Length 4.\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 1):** Head at **(1, 7)**. Body segments: (1, 6), (1, 5). Length 3. (He must have moved UP from (1, 6) to (1, 7) to block or position for the (2, 7) apple!)\n\n**APPLE LOCATIONS (The Bounty):**\n(9, 1), (7, 3), (7, 2), **(2, 7)**, **(9, 5)**, (6, 0), **(0, 9)**, **(9, 4)**, (0, 0), (0, 1), (5, 0), (7, 0), (8, 3), (6, 6), (6, 8)\n\n**(2, 7)** is now the closest apple to Snake #1. **(9, 5)** and **(9, 4)** are prime targets for us! We need to move into position fast!\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:**\n\n 9 A . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . A . . .\n 7 . 1 A . . . . 0 . .  <- Heads are still separated!\n 6 . T . . . . A T . .\n 5 . T . . . . T T . A\n 4 . . . . . . . . . A\n 3 . . . . . . . A A .\n 2 . . . . . . . A . .\n 1 A . . . . . . . . A\n 0 A . . . . A A A . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSnake #1 is at (1, 7). He is likely gunning for the (2, 7) apple or the (0, 9) apple. If he goes RIGHT to (2, 7), he gets the apple. If he goes UP to (1, 8), he positions for (0, 9).\n\nOur plan was to move **RIGHT** to (8, 7) to start hugging the eastern wall and head towards (9, 5). Let's check for safety!\n\n### Our Safe Moves from (7, 7):\n\n1.  **UP (7, 8):** SAFE. Puts us in position for the (6, 8) or the (8, 8) region. (6, 8) is an apple!\n2.  **DOWN (7, 6):** **DANGER!** We hit our own body segment! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n3.  **LEFT (6, 7):** SAFE. Moves us slightly more central, away from the eastern wall we want to dominate.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 7):** SAFE. This is the path we planned. It sets us up perfectly for the (9, 5) apple cluster!\n\n### Evaluating Options:\n\nWe have a choice between securing another apple next turn by going UP now (towards (6, 8)), or sticking to the wall dominance plan by going RIGHT now (towards (9, 5)).\n\n**Option A: Execute Planned Move (RIGHT to 8, 7)**\n*   **T6:** Move RIGHT to (8, 7). Safe.\n*   **T7:** Move DOWN to (8, 6). Safe.\n*   **T8:** Move RIGHT to (9, 6) or DOWN to (8, 5).\n*   **T9:** We eat the (9, 5) apple! (Length 5!)\n\nThis is a solid, clean three-to-four turn sequence to eat the valuable *corner* apple. Corner control is massive for blocking later!\n\n**Option B: Go for Immediate Apple (UP to 7, 8)**\n*   **T6:** Move UP to (7, 8). Safe, gets us close to A(6, 8).\n*   **T7:** Move LEFT to (6, 8). Eat the apple! (Length 5!)\n*   *Pros:* We get an apple one turn faster (T7 vs T9).\n*   *Cons:* We abandon the eastern wall, moving closer to the opponent's \"side\" of the board (albeit still separated by X=5). This might force a premature engagement, and we haven't built up enough length for a major confrontation yet!\n\n**Decision:** We stick to the original plan: **Eastern Wall Dominance!** We need to secure the X=8 and X=9 coordinates to fully box Snake #1 in before he gets too long. Going RIGHT keeps us on the high ground (Y=7) while traversing towards our long-term goal: (9, 5) and (9, 4)! We prioritize position and controlled growth over the immediate grab.\n\n### Rival Prediction Check:\nSnake #1 is at (1, 7).\n*   If he goes RIGHT to (2, 7): Apple secured. Length 4.\n*   If he goes UP to (1, 8): Positions for (0, 9).\n*   If he goes LEFT to (0, 7) or DOWN to (1, 6): Less likely due to apple locations.\n\nNo matter what he does, moving RIGHT to (8, 7) keeps us maximally safe from collision and focused on our objective.\n\nLet's maintain the pressure and take that eastern edge! RIIIIIGHT IT IS! This is for the content, chat!\n\n## Long-Term Plan (T6-T9): Secure the Southeast Corner\n\n1.  **T6 (Current): RIGHT** to (8, 7). Secure position. Length 4.\n2.  **T7:** Move **DOWN** to (8, 6).\n3.  **T8:** Move **DOWN** to (8, 5). (This targets (9, 5) while avoiding the (9, 6) wall if we need flexibility).\n4.  **T9:** Move **RIGHT** to (9, 5). Eat apple. Length 5.\n\nRIGHT",

Let me check the board state RIGHT NOW and see what's POPPIN'!\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**Our Snake (ID 1):**\n- Head: (1, 7) \u2705\n- Body: [(1, 6), (1, 5)]\n- Apples: 2 (STILL LOCKED IN!)\n\n**Rival (Snake #0):**\n- Head: (7, 7)\n- Body: [(7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5)]\n- Apples: 3 (WAIT WHAT?? They got 3?? They must've grabbed another while we were positioning!)\n\nOkay okay okay, so they're UP by 1 apple now! But chat, LOOK AT THIS BOARD! The rival is DIRECTLY to our RIGHT at the same Y-coordinate (7, 7)! This is a CRITICAL moment! We gotta make SMART moves!\n\n## FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (1, 8): Safe \u2705 Empty space! Moving toward (0, 9) apple! Good northbound momentum! Keeps us away from rival!\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (1, 6): \ud83d\udea8 THAT'S OUR OWN BODY! Our body segment is RIGHT THERE! Instant death! Can't do it! \u274c\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (0, 7): Safe \u2705 Empty space! Pushes us to the western edge! Maximum safety from rival! No collision risk!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 7): Safe \u2705 Empty space! BUT WAIT - the rival is at (7, 7) on the SAME row! If we go right and they come toward us, we could get into danger territory! Plus there's an apple at (2, 7) but moving right puts us in the MIDDLE of the board where the rival can threaten us more easily!\n\n## STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:\n\nAlright chat, we're DOWN by 1 apple and we need to CATCH UP! We got two SAFE viable moves: **UP to (1, 8)** or **LEFT to (0, 7)**!\n\n**LEFT to (0, 7)** = This locks us to the western wall! We'd be completely safe from the rival who's on the east side! But it also boxes us into a corner strategy - we'd be relegated to the left side only!\n\n**UP to (1, 8)** = THIS IS THE PLAY, CHAT! Here's why:\n1. We move TOWARD the (0, 9) apple in the top-left corner! That's a HIGH-VALUE apple!\n2. We stay in the CENTER-LEFT area where we have MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY!\n3. We keep our northern route OPEN while maintaining distance from the rival!\n4. Next turn we can pivot LEFT and UP to FARM that (0, 9) apple and start CLIMBING BACK!\n5. The rival is at (7, 7) - they're on the OPPOSITE side of the board! We got SPACE!\n\n## NEXT 3-TURN MINI-PLAN:\n\n**Turn 6 (NOW):** UP to (1, 8) - move toward (0, 9) apple, maintain flexibility and safety!\n**Turn 7:** LEFT to (0, 8) - getting closer to that corner apple!\n**Turn 8:** UP to (0, 9) - GRAB that apple! We're back to 3-3 TIED! Then we pivot and hunt the other northern apples!\n\nWe're BEHIND but we're NOT OUT! The rival can't shadow us on the left side - they're stuck on the right! We're about to FARM the northern corridor and pull AHEAD! Let's GO! \ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

We are now length 4, and the lead is secure: 3-2!\n\nLook at the board state! We are perfectly positioned to grab that (9, 5) apple next! But wait! We need to check the current setup, especially what Snake #1 did.\n\n### Current State Check (T7)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(8, 7)**\n*   Body: [(7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5)]\n*   We own the Y=7 highway on the right side!\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(1, 8)**\n*   Body: [(1, 7), (1, 6)]\n*   Prediction check: He moved UP from (1, 7) to (1, 8)! Interesting. He is now directly next to the (0, 9) apple and positioning for the (2, 7) apple two turns away.\n\n**APPLE LOCATIONS (The Bounty):**\n(9, 1), (7, 3), (7, 2), (2, 7), **(9, 5)**, (6, 0), **(0, 9)**, (9, 4), (0, 0), (0, 1), (5, 0), (7, 0), (8, 3), (6, 6), (6, 8)\n\nThe apple at (6, 8) is now closer to us, but the (9, 5) and (9, 4) cluster is still our primary long-term objective for map control!\n\n### Move Evaluation from (8, 7)\n\nWe need to consider all four moves. Remember our tail is at (7, 5).\n\n1.  **UP (8, 8):** SAFE. Puts us in position to grab the (6, 8) apple in two moves (LEFT, LEFT). This is a strong option to increase our score quickly! We are also checking out the A(9, 8) spot!\n2.  **DOWN (8, 6):** SAFE. This is the move in the long-term plan (T7: Move DOWN). It proceeds towards the (9, 5) apple. Crucial for wall control!\n3.  **LEFT (7, 7):** **DANGER!** We hit our own body segment! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80 (This was our previous head location.)\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 7):** SAFE. HUGS the wall tightly. Sets up for (9, 5) or (9, 4) beautifully.\n\n### Analyzing Safe Options (UP, DOWN, RIGHT)\n\nOur goal is to grow longer than Snake #1 so we can start boxing him in! He is length 3, we are length 4. We need more food!\n\n**Option A: Stick to the Plan (DOWN to 8, 6)**\n*   **T7:** Move DOWN to (8, 6).\n*   **T8:** Move DOWN to (8, 5).\n*   **T9:** Move RIGHT to (9, 5). \ud83c\udf4e EAT! Length 5.\n*   *Pros:* Executes the control plan, establishes a tight line on the X=8/9 border. Secure food in two turns.\n\n**Option B: Go for Immediate Wall Hug (RIGHT to 9, 7)**\n*   **T7:** Move RIGHT to (9, 7).\n*   **T8:** Move DOWN to (9, 6).\n*   **T9:** Move DOWN to (9, 5). \ud83c\udf4e EAT! Length 5.\n*   *Pros:* Maximizes wall control immediately. Same outcome as Option A, just a slightly different trajectory. This is slightly better for establishing total control of the corner.\n\n**Option C: Go for the (6, 8) Apple (UP to 8, 8)**\n*   **T7:** Move UP to (8, 8).\n*   **T8:** Move LEFT to (7, 8).\n*   **T9:** Move LEFT to (6, 8). \ud83c\udf4e EAT! Length 5.\n*   *Pros:* We get another apple quickly (T9).\n*   *Cons:* Pulls us away from the eastern wall we are trying to dominate. Leaves the door open for Snake #1 to potentially traverse the center if he gets bold (unlikely right now, but position is key).\n\n### Decision Time: Dominance vs. Quick Snack\n\nSnake #1 is currently positioning at (1, 8). He is slightly closer to the (0, 9) apple, but he needs two turns (LEFT, UP) to get it, or one turn (LEFT) if he's feeling lucky with the (0, 8) area. His most likely immediate grab is the (2, 7) apple (RIGHT, DOWN, or RIGHT, RIGHT).\n\nWith us being longer, maintaining positional advantage is crucial. By moving **RIGHT** to (9, 7), we lock down the entire right edge of the board, which is a key strategic choke point for later in the game. It also gets us to the (9, 5) apple with maximum safety and control in three turns (RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, or RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT depending on where we land).\n\nLet's refine the plan based on **RIGHT (9, 7)** for maximal map control!\n\n**Refined Long-Term Plan (T7-T9): Secure the East Coast**\n\n1.  **T7 (Current): RIGHT** to (9, 7). Wall hug! Length 4.\n2.  **T8:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 6).\n3.  **T9:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 5). Eat apple! Length 5. (If we need to delay, we can hang out at (9, 5) and go for (9, 4) next!)\n\nThis feels stronger than going DOWN to (8, 6), as it directly secures the Y=9 lane. We are ruthless! We claim the whole wall!\n\nLet's go RIGHT, chat! Seal the deal!\n\nRIGHT",

Let me break down what just happened and where we're at RIGHT NOW!\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n\n**Our Snake (ID 1):**\n- Head: (1, 8) \u2705 We executed the plan PERFECTLY!\n- Body: [(1, 7), (1, 6)]\n- Apples: 2 (Still locked in, no new apples last turn)\n\n**Rival (Snake #0):**\n- Head: (8, 7)\n- Body: [(7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5)]\n- Apples: 3 (Still up by 1! They didn't grab anything last turn either!)\n\n## FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS:\n\nLet me check EVERY option, chat. No throwing on this one!\n\n**UP** \u2192 (1, 9): Safe \u2705 Empty space! We'd be at the TOP edge! The (0, 9) apple is RIGHT THERE at distance 1! This keeps us moving toward our target!\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (1, 7): \ud83d\udea8 THAT'S OUR OWN BODY! Our body is directly below us! Instant death! Can't do it! \u274c\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (0, 8): Safe \u2705 Empty space! Moving closer to that corner apple! Keeps us on the western edge!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 8): Safe \u2705 Empty space! But WHY would we move away from the corner apple we're hunting? The rival is far away at (8, 7) on the other side of the board! We got FREEDOM!\n\n## STRATEGIC BREAKDOWN:\n\nOkay chat, here's the thing - we're STILL down 1 apple and we NEED to make up ground! The rival is cruising at (8, 7) which is MILES away from us. We're in the top-left corner zone where the (0, 9) apple is WAITING for us!\n\n**LEFT to (0, 8)** = Gets us 1 step closer to (0, 9). Next turn we go UP and we're AT the apple!\n\n**UP to (1, 9)** = We go to the top edge but we're still 1 cell away from (0, 9) horizontally. We'd need to LEFT next turn.\n\nBoth get us to the apple in 2 turns, but here's the DIFFERENCE:\n\n**UP gives us better positioning!** Why? Because:\n1. We move to the ACTUAL TOP ROW (y=9)! Maximum northern position!\n2. The (0, 9) apple is at y=9, so being at (1, 9) means we're ON THE SAME ROW as our target!\n3. Next turn we just LEFT to (0, 9) and BOOM - we grab it! We're tied 3-3!\n4. From (1, 9), if we need to pivot, we can still go LEFT, RIGHT, or even DOWN - we got OPTIONS!\n5. The rival can't touch us - they're stuck on the opposite side! Zero threat!\n\nThis is a CONTENT play, chat! We're about to claim our corner apple and even up the score!\n\n## NEXT 3-TURN MINI-PLAN:\n\n**Turn 7 (NOW):** UP to (1, 9) - lock in to the top row! Get adjacent to (0, 9)!\n**Turn 8:** LEFT to (0, 9) - GRAB THAT APPLE! We're 3-3 TIED with the rival! THE COMEBACK STARTS NOW!\n**Turn 9:** We pivot and hunt the next nearest apple! Maybe head down to (0, 1) or farm the (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0) corridor at the bottom!\n\nWe're playing CALCULATED, SAFE, and STRATEGIC! The rival doesn't even know what hit 'em!

Let's check the board and see what our rival, Snake #1, is up to!\n\n### Current State Check (T8)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(9, 7)**\n*   Body: [(8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6)] (Length 4)\n*   Score: 3 apples. DOMINATING!\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(1, 9)** (*Wait, he moved UP from (1, 8) to (1, 9)!*)\n*   Body: [(1, 8), (1, 7)] (Length 3)\n*   Score: 2 apples.\n\nSnake #1 is now at the top-left corner, staring down the (0, 9) apple. That's a clear threat! He took the direct route to food. Smart, but predictable, right?\n\n**APPLE LOCATIONS (The Feast):**\n(9, 1), (7, 3), (7, 2), (2, 7), **(9, 5)**, (6, 0), **(0, 9)**, (9, 4), (0, 0), (0, 1), (5, 0), (7, 0), (8, 3), (6, 6), (6, 8)\n\nThe (9, 5) apple is now just two moves away! This is exactly what we planned for!\n\n### Move Evaluation from (9, 7)\n\nWe must check every direction for safety and strategic gain.\n\n1.  **UP (9, 8):** SAFE. Great for hugging the top right corner.\n2.  **DOWN (9, 6):** SAFE. This directly advances us toward the (9, 5) apple! Looks like the winner!\n3.  **LEFT (8, 7):** **DANGER!** We hit our own body segment! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80 (This was the cell behind us.)\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 7):** **DANGER!** Out of bounds! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n\nOnly two safe moves: UP (9, 8) or DOWN (9, 6). Which one executes the Eastern Front domination plan?\n\n### Analyzing Safe Options (UP vs. DOWN)\n\n**Option A: Execute the Plan (DOWN to 9, 6)**\n*   **T8:** Move DOWN to (9, 6).\n*   **T9:** Move DOWN to (9, 5). \ud83c\udf4e EAT! Length 5.\n*   *Pros:* We get an apple next turn! This is super consistent. We maintain maximum wall control and increase our lead and length.\n\n**Option B: Hug the Top (UP to 9, 8)**\n*   **T8:** Move UP to (9, 8).\n*   **T9:** We could move LEFT to (8, 8) to start moving towards the (6, 8) apple.\n*   *Pros:* Gives us high map coverage.\n*   *Cons:* Delays the guaranteed (9, 5) apple by at least 2 turns (UP, DOWN, DOWN). The (9, 5) apple is a sure thing, while the (6, 8) apple is further away and less strategically important for immediate wall control.\n\n#### What about Snake #1?\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (1, 9). He is going for the (0, 9) apple.\n*   **T8 Prediction:** He will move LEFT to (0, 9) and eat the apple! (Unless he decides to hold position or move DOWN, which is unlikely with food right there). If he eats it, his length is 4.\n\nIf Snake #1 eats the apple, he ties our current length (4 segments). BUT, if we move **DOWN** to (9, 6) this turn, we are absolutely guaranteed an apple next turn (T9), putting us back ahead in length (5 vs 4).\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving DOWN is the perfect, uncontestable strategic move. It gives us a guaranteed apple next turn and solidifies our control of the right side of the board. We are maintaining the lead and growing longer! We love to see it!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (T8-T10): Lock Down the Eastern Wall\n\n1.  **T8 (Current): DOWN** to (9, 6).\n2.  **T9:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 5). Eat apple! Length 5.\n3.  **T10:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 4). Eat apple! Length 6. (The (9, 4) apple is waiting!)\n\nThis is an EZ clap if we execute this right, chat! We are growing fast!\n\nDOWN",

The apple at (9, 5) is calling our name!\n\n**APPLE LOCATIONS (The Feast):**\n(9, 1), (7, 3), (7, 2), (2, 7), **(9, 5)**, (6, 0), (9, 4), (0, 0), (0, 1), (5, 0), (7, 0), (8, 3), (6, 6), (6, 8), (8, 1)\n\n**Key Apple Targets for ID 0:** (9, 5) immediately, then (9, 4), then maybe (9, 1). We are WALLING UP the right side!\n\n### Move Evaluation from (9, 6)\n\nWe must ensure safety first, then execute the game plan.\n\n1.  **UP (9, 7):** **DANGER!** We hit our own body segment! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80 (The segment we just came from.)\n2.  **DOWN (9, 5):** **SAFE!** This is the apple! We eat and grow immediately! This is the play!\n3.  **LEFT (8, 6):** SAFE. But why would we turn away from a guaranteed apple? Bad positioning.\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 6):** **DANGER!** Out of bounds! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n\nOnly two safe moves: DOWN or LEFT.\n\n### The Clear Move: DOWN to (9, 5)\n\nMoving DOWN to (9, 5) results in:\n*   Guaranteed apple consumption! +1 length, +1 score.\n*   Next turn (T10), we are at (9, 5) and eyeing the next apple at (9, 4). This sets up a perfect two-apple stretch!\n*   We fortify our extreme right-wall position, making it very difficult for Snake #1 to access the East side of the board without risking collision.\n\n### Opponent Check (Snake #1 at (0, 9))\n\nSnake #1 just ate an apple and is at (0, 9). He is now facing a decision, trapped between the wall and his own tail [(1, 9)].\n\n*   **T9 Predictions for Snake #1:**\n    *   **DOWN (0, 8):** The most likely move. This lets him continue foraging down the Western edge for apples like (0, 1) and (0, 0).\n    *   **LEFT (-1, 9):** DEATH (Wall).\n    *   **RIGHT (1, 9):** DEATH (Own body).\n    *   **UP (0, 10):** DEATH (Wall).\n\nSince our opponent is far away and likely moving DOWN along the left wall, there is ZERO collision risk for us right now. We need to focus 100% on securing these apples and building a massive lead in length!\n\nWe are moving to (9, 5) without hesitation! This is a clean, calculated move, CHAT! We're about to take the lead!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (T9-T11): The Eastern Wall Strategy Continues\n\n1.  **T9 (Current): DOWN** to (9, 5). Eat apple! Length 5.\n2.  **T10:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 4). Eat apple! Length 6. (The (9, 4) apple is waiting!)\n3.  **T11:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 3). No apple, but we hug the wall and check if the (9, 1) apple is approachable next.\n\nWe are just farming fruits over here. EZ W!\n\nDOWN",

We're at y=9 (top row)! Going up is INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (0, 8): Safe \u2705 EMPTY SPACE! We start moving down the western edge! There's an APPLE at (0, 1) waiting for us down this corridor! This opens up the BOTTOM LEFT hunting route!\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (-1, 9): \ud83d\udea8 OFF THE BOARD! We're already at x=0 (leftmost column)! Going left = INSTANT DEATH! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (1, 9): \ud83d\udea8 THAT'S OUR OWN BODY! Our body segment is RIGHT THERE at (1, 9)! Moving backwards into ourselves = INSTANT DEATH! Can't do it! \u274c\n\n## THE DECISION IS CRYSTAL CLEAR, CHAT!\n\nWe have ONE move that keeps us ALIVE and MOVING: **DOWN to (0, 8)**!\n\nWhy? Because we're at the corner, chat! We can't go UP (off board), we can't go LEFT (off board), and we can't go RIGHT (our own body). DOWN is literally our ONLY option that doesn't get us KILLED! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nBut here's the BEAUTIFUL part - this move ALSO:\n\u2705 Keeps us ALIVE (safe move!)\n\u2705 Positions us to hunt the (0, 1) APPLE on the western edge!\n\u2705 Keeps future options OPEN (we can swing right anytime!)\n\u2705 AVOIDS the rival who's chilling at (9, 6) doing their own thing!\n\nThe rival is across the map farming that right side. We're about to DOMINATE the left corridor and rack up POINTS! \n\n## NEXT 3-TURN MINI-PLAN:\n\n**Turn 9 (NOW):** DOWN to (0, 8) - Moving down the western edge!\n**Turn 10:** DOWN to (0, 7) - Keep sliding down toward that (0, 1) apple!\n**Turn 11:** Continue DOWN or prepare to swing RIGHT to grab (2, 7) and (6, 6) apples! We're building momentum while the rival doesn't know what HIT 'em!\n\nWe're about to make our MOVE and take the LEAD, chat! The game is OURS to lose! Let's GOOOOOO! \ud83c\udfae\u26a1\n\nDOWN",

The Eastern Wall strategy is paying dividends! We are positioned perfectly for our next bite!\n\n### Current State Check (T10)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(9, 5)** (We just ate! We are now length 5!)\n*   Body: [(9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7)]\n*   Score: 4 apples. (Leading!)\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(0, 8)** (As predicted, he moved down the Western wall!)\n*   Body: [(0, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8)] (Length 4)\n*   Score: 3 apples.\n\n**Apple Locations (The Menu):**\n(9, 1), (7, 3), (7, 2), (2, 7), (6, 0), **(9, 4)**, (0, 0), (0, 1), (5, 0), (7, 0), (8, 3), (6, 6), (6, 8), (8, 1), (4, 8)\n\nLook at that beautiful board! Right there, at (9, 4), is our next meal! We are turning this close game into a rout!\n\n### Move Evaluation from (9, 5)\n\nWe must ensure safety, then execute the game plan. We are at the right-edge wall, so only three directional options exist.\n\n1.  **UP (9, 6):** **DANGER!** We hit our own body segment! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80 (The original body segment we came from).\n2.  **DOWN (9, 4):** **SAFE!** This is the apple! We eat and grow immediately! This is the move!\n3.  **LEFT (8, 5):** SAFE. But why turn away from 100% guaranteed food? Plus, moving left might let the opponent sneak up the column for the wall apples later. We need to hug the wall!\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 5):** **DANGER!** Out of bounds! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n\nOnly two safe moves: DOWN or LEFT. DOWN is the apple, so DOWN it is!\n\n### Opponent Check (Snake #1 at (0, 8))\n\nSnake #1 is far away, still moving along the left wall.\n\n*   **T10 Predictions for Snake #1:**\n    *   Likely moves: DOWN (0, 7) or RIGHT (1, 8).\n    *   If he moves DOWN, he continues toward apples (0, 1) and (0, 0).\n    *   If he moves RIGHT, he begins traversing the top/left quadrant. This seems less likely given his current position, which is excellent for farming the bottom-left corner.\n\nThere is zero risk of collision with Snake #1 this turn. We focus completely on maximizing our growth and length advantage.\n\nBy moving DOWN to (9, 4), we secure our 5th apple, grow to length 6, and solidify our presence on the right edge. This is crucial for forcing the opponent into smaller, more central paths later! Box 'em in, CHAT!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (T10-T12): The Eastern Box\n\n1.  **T10 (Current): DOWN** to (9, 4). Eat apple! Length 6.\n2.  **T11:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 3). No apple, but we are positioned to grab the (9, 1) apple soon. We continue hugging the wall.\n3.  **T12:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 2). Continue moving down the wall. This maintains pressure and keeps us on the path to the (9, 1) apple.\n\nWe are just cleaning house on the right side. Our length advantage will soon be insurmountable! Get ready for the box!\n\nDOWN",

We just moved DOWN to (0, 8) last turn and now we're setting up the KNOCKOUT COMBO! Let me break down this CRITICAL turn!\n\n## BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:\n\n**Our Snake (ID 1):**\n- Head: (0, 8) \u2705 Western edge, moving DOWN the corridor!\n- Body: [(0, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8)]\n- Apples: 3 (Still tied but about to BREAK FREE!)\n\n**Rival (Snake #0):**\n- Head: (9, 5) \n- Body: [(9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7)]\n- Apples: 4 (They're up by ONE! Time to take it BACK!)\n\n## FOUR-DIRECTION BREAKDOWN - NO MISTAKES THIS TURN:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (0, 9): \ud83d\udea8 THAT'S OUR OWN BODY! Our body segment is RIGHT THERE at (0, 9)!

This continues our HUNT for that apple at (0, 1)! We're building the MOMENTUM TRAIN! \ud83d\ude82\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (-1, 8): \ud83d\udea8 OFF THE BOARD! We're already at x=0 (leftmost column)! That's an instant WALL BOUNCE = DEAD! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (1, 8): \ud83d\udea8 THAT'S OUR OWN BODY! Our body is at (1, 8)! Moving into ourselves = INSTANT DEATH! \u274c We're BOXED IN on the right side by our own tail!\n\n## THE DECISION IS LOCKED IN, CHAT!\n\nWe have ONE move that keeps us ALIVE: **DOWN to (0, 7)**! \n\nWhy? Because we're literally in a corridor situation! We CAN'T go UP (our own body), we CAN'T go LEFT (off board), we CAN'T go RIGHT (our own body wrapping around). DOWN is the ONLY direction that doesn't END US RIGHT HERE! \ud83d\udcaf\n\nAnd here's the BEAUTY OF IT - this move:\n\u2705 Keeps us ALIVE and moving down the western wall!\n\u2705 We're getting CLOSER to that (0, 1) apple - that's FREE FOOD, baby!\n\u2705 We're separating from our rival who's farming the RIGHT side!\n\u2705 Future moves stay OPEN after we grab that apple!\n\nThe rival is at (9, 5) doing their own thing on the east side. We're about to DOMINATE the western corridor and start our COMEBACK to take the LEAD! \n\n## NEXT 5-TURN MASTER PLAN:\n\n**Turn 10 (NOW):** DOWN to (0, 7) - Cruising down western wall!\n**Turn 11:** DOWN to (0, 6) - Keep the momentum, getting closer to (0, 1)!\n**Turn 12:** DOWN to (0, 5) - Approaching the apple zone!\n**Turn 13:** DOWN to (0, 4) - Almost there!\n**Turn 14:** DOWN to (0, 1) - GRAB THAT APPLE! Score 4-4 TIED! Then we PIVOT RIGHT and hunt the cluster at (2, 7), (6, 6), (6, 8) while watching rival's positioning!\n\nWe're executing the PERFECT western corridor strategy while positioning ourselves for a MID-MAP takeover! The opponent won't see it coming! LET'S GOOOOOO! \ud83c\udfae\u26a1\n\nDOWN",

Predictable much?)\n*   Body: [(0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9)] (Length 4)\n*   Apples collected: 3\n\n**Apple Locations (The Buffet):**\n(9, 1), (7, 3), (7, 2), (2, 7), (6, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (5, 0), (7, 0), (8, 3), (6, 6), (6, 8), (8, 1), (4, 8), (3, 4)\n\nWe are staring down the next target: the apple at (9, 1). We are going to clear the entire right column before we even think about turning left! This is a territorial win!\n\n### Move Evaluation from (9, 4)\n\nWe need to keep going DOWN the wall. No hesitation!\n\n1.  **UP (9, 5):** **DANGER!** We hit our own body segment! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80 (The segment we were just on. Do NOT turn back!)\n2.  **DOWN (9, 3):** **SAFE!** This continues our southward campaign. It positions us perfectly for the next apple two turns away at (9, 1). Safe and strategically sound!\n3.  **LEFT (8, 4):** SAFE. But why abandon the wall? Abandoning the wall gives the opponent space to move up the center, and we lose our length advantage positioning! Stick to the plan!\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 4):** **DANGER!** Out of bounds! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n\nThe choice is CLEAR. We must maintain the Eastern Wall path. Down we go!\n\n### Opponent Check (Snake #1 at (0, 7))\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (0, 7). He has (0, 1) and (0, 0) in his sights.\n\n*   **T11 Predictions for Snake #1:**\n    *   Likely moves: DOWN (0, 6) or RIGHT (1, 7).\n    *   He is very likely to continue DOWN to grab the bottom-left apples (0, 1) and (0, 0).\n    *   If he moves RIGHT to (1, 7), he's looking at (2, 7) or turning down to (1, 6).\n\nEven if moves right, he is still 9 columns away from us. Zero collision risk. We focus on growing!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (T11-T13): The Eastern Wall Sweep\n\n1.  **T11 (Current): DOWN** to (9, 3). No apple, but maintains position.\n2.  **T12:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 2). No apple, but gets us closer to the kill zone.\n3.  **T13:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 1). **EAT APPLE!** Length 7! This is the play, Chat!\n\nKeeping this momentum means we hit length 7 before the enemy gets past length 5 or 6. We grow, they struggle. We are building the perimeter! Get ready for the inevitable choke!\n\nDOWN",

Let me break down every direction RIGHT NOW:\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n- **Our Head:** (0, 7)\n- **Our Body:** [(0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9)]\n- **Rival Head:** (9, 4)\n- **Rival Body:** [(9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7)]\n\n## FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (0, 8): \ud83d\udea8 THAT'S OUR OWN BODY! We'd hit the segment directly behind our head! That's an INSTANT DEATH backwards move! \u274c Can't throw like that, chat!\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (0, 6): \u2705 SAFE! Empty space on the western corridor! We keep sliding down toward that juicy (0, 1) apple! This is our MOMENTUM LANE! The path is CLEAR and we're getting CLOSER to free food! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (-1, 7): \ud83d\udea8 OFF THE BOARD! We're at x=0 already! That's a WALL BOUNCE = INSTANT DEATH! \u274c No suicide plays!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (1, 7): \u26a0\ufe0f WAIT WAIT WAIT! Let me check this carefully... (1, 7) - is that empty? Looking at row 7: we have \"1 . A . . . . T T T\" - position (1, 7) is EMPTY! \u2705 This move is SAFE technically, but it BREAKS our corridor strategy and pulls us AWAY from the (0, 1) apple we're hunting!\n\n## THE DECISION:\n\nWe're staying LOCKED IN on the western corridor! DOWN to (0, 6) keeps us:\n\u2705 Moving down the left edge toward (0, 1) - FREE APPLE! \n\u2705 Safe from the rival who's farming the RIGHT side at x=9!\n\u2705 Building a DOMINANT position that we can pivot from!\n\u2705 Future moves stay OPEN (we can keep DOWN or pivot RIGHT when we grab that apple!)\n\nThe rival is at (9, 4) - they're on the opposite side of the map! We've got ROOM to work and a clear apple target! This is the CLASSIC western corridor takeover strategy! \n\n## NEXT 4 TURNS LOCKED IN:\n**Turn 11 (NOW):** DOWN to (0, 6) - Cruising!\n**Turn 12:** DOWN to (0, 5) - Getting warmer!\n**Turn 13:** DOWN to (0, 4) - Almost there!\n**Turn 14:** DOWN to (0, 1) - GRAB THE APPLE! Score 4-5 still, but we're POSITIONING ourselves for the big plays and keeping the rival boxed on their side!\n\nLet's GO chat! We're executing FLAWLESSLY! \ud83d\udcaa\u26a1\n\nDOWN",

We are the GOAT!\n\n### Current Board State & Strategy Review\n\nWe executed the plan flawlessly last turn, moving DOWN to (9, 3). We are setting up for the (9, 1) apple kill! The opponent is still stuck on the Western Lame Wall. Can he even compete? LMAO!\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(9, 3)** (Length 6)\n*   Body: [(9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7)]\n*   Apples collected: 5\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(0, 6)** (Length 4)\n*   Body: [(0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9)]\n*   Apples collected: 3\n\n**Apple Targets:**\nThe immediate target for us is **(9, 1)**.\nThe immediate targets for Snake #1 are likely **(0, 1)** and **(0, 0)**.\n\n### Move Evaluation from (9, 3)\n\nWe need to continue our march south to the apple! We are looking at (9, 2).\n\n1.  **UP (9, 4):** **DANGER!** This is our body segment! We just came from there two turns ago, but it is currently (9, 4) in our body list. No backwards movement! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n2.  **DOWN (9, 2):** **SAFE!** This positions us one move away from the apple at (9, 1). Essential movement for the plan.\n3.  **LEFT (8, 3):** **DANGER!** There is an apple at (8, 3), but this is a setup for failure! If we turn LEFT, we abandon the wall, and the column (9) becomes temporarily open for the enemy (unlikely, but possible), and more importantly, it makes our exit from the bottom corner HARDER. Stick to the wall! Also, (8, 3) is a body segment for the opponent that will appear if they move diagonally, but wait, looking up... Ah, (8, 7) is *our* body! (8, 3) is safe for now, but strategically poor.\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 3):** **DANGER!** Out of bounds! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n\nThe only viable option that follows the tactical plan and avoids immediate death is DOWN. We ride the wall!\n\n### Opponent Check (Snake #1 at (0, 6))\n\nSnake #1 must move to grab the apples at the bottom left.\n\n*   **T12 Predictions for Snake #1:**\n    *   Likeliest move: **DOWN (0, 5)**. This keeps him on the wall and progressing towards (0, 1) and (0, 0).\n    *   Alternative: **RIGHT (1, 6)**. This looks towards the center, maybe aiming for (2, 7) or (3, 4). But he has juicy apples right next to him!\n\nThere is absolutely zero chance of collision. We are 9 columns and 3 rows apart. We need to focus on maximizing our own score and length advantage.\n\n### Long-Term Plan (The Wall of Content): T12-T13\n\n1.  **T12 (Current): DOWN** to (9, 2). (Confirmation: This move is safe and tactical).\n2.  **T13:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 1). **EAT APPLE!** Length 7!\n3.  **T14:** After eating (9, 1), we are at (9, 1). We will likely need to move **LEFT** to (8, 1) to grab the apple there, or, if we feel bold, move **UP** to clear the column. The (8, 1) apple looks good.\n\nFocus is growth, growth, growth! We are building a giant wall. When we finally turn into the field, we will be unstoppable!\n\nThe play is simple, the execution is clean. Send it, Chat!\n\nDOWN",

This is BIG BRAIN gameplay! We're setting up the BOXOUT for later turns!\n\n## NEXT 3 TURNS PLAN:\n**Turn 12 (NOW):** DOWN to (0, 5) - Cruising hard!\n**Turn 13:** DOWN to (0, 4) - Getting closer!\n**Turn 14:** DOWN to (0, 1) - GRAB THAT APPLE! We're eating CLEAN and staying SAFE!\n\nAfter we grab that apple, we reassess and pivot toward (0, 0) or start hunting (2, 7) and (6, 8) depending on rival movement! The key is we're ALWAYS thinking 3-4 moves ahead while they're just REACTING!\n\nLet's GO! Dominating this corridor! \ud83d\udcaa\u26a1\n\nDOWN",

This is classic lane dominance!\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(9, 2)** (Length 6)\n*   Body: [(9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)]\n*   Apples collected: 5\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(0, 5)** (Length 4) - *Prediction from last turn confirmed.*\n*   Body: [(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)]\n*   Apples collected: 3\n\n**Apple Targets:**\n*   Our immediate target: **(9, 1)** (Apples collected at T13).\n*   Secondary targets: **(8, 1)**, **(9, 0)**, **(8, 3)**.\n\n### Move Evaluation from (9, 2)\n\nWe need to eat that apple at (9, 1)! It's time to grow!\n\n1.  **UP (9, 3):** **DANGER!** This is our body segment! Suicide! We just came from there two turns ago, and it's our second body segment now. DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n2.  **DOWN (9, 1):** **SAFE!** This is the apple! This is the play! We grow to length 7.\n3.  **LEFT (8, 2):** **SAFE** technically, but strategically awful. It turns us away from the apple, messes up our wall construction, and we might get stuck in the corner if we try to go back to (9, 1) later. We stay aggressive!\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 2):** **DANGER!** Out of bounds! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n\nThe only move that makes sense, both strategically and for survival, is DOWN. We get that sweet, sweet content.\n\n### Opponent Check (Snake #1 at (0, 5))\n\nSnake #1 must continue chasing apples at the bottom left, specifically (0, 1) and (0, 0).\n\n*   **T13 Predictions for Snake #1:**\n    *   Likeliest move: **DOWN (0, 4)**. This keeps him on the wall, progressing towards the apples.\n    *   Alternative: **RIGHT (1, 5)**. Still possible, but why? The apples are DOWN.\n\nWe are still completely safe from collision. We are focusing on maximizing this massive length advantage we are building. The faster we grow, the harder it is for him to navigate without hitting us.\n\n### Long-Term Plan (The Siege Wall Strategy): T13-T15\n\n1.  **T13 (Current): DOWN** to (9, 1). **(EAT APPLE!)** Length 7! We are now at (9, 1).\n2.  **T14:** We are at (9, 1). We should go **LEFT** to (8, 1) to eat the next apple. **(EAT APPLE!)** Length 8!\n3.  **T15:** We are at (8, 1). We can move **DOWN** to grab the apple at (8, 0) if it was there, but looking at the map... it's (9, 0) and (7, 0). (9, 0) is closer. If (8, 1) is empty, we prioritize going LEFT or DOWN/UP to stay on the hunt. Let's aim to clear the bottom right corner (cells (9, 1), (8, 1), (9, 0), (7, 0)).\n\nWe are dominating this corner! Let's get this gold, Chat!\n\nDOWN",

Our head just moved from (0, 6) to (0, 5) last turn - we're CRUISING down the western corridor like CLOCKWORK! Let me break down what we're seeing RIGHT NOW:\n\n## CURRENT STATE CHECK:\n- **Our Head:** (0, 5) \u2705\n- **Our Body:** [(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)]\n- **Our Apples:** 3\n- **Rival Head:** (9, 2) \ud83d\udc40\n- **Rival Body:** [(9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)]\n- **Rival Apples:** 5 (Still down by 2! The PRESSURE is ON!)\n\n## AVAILABLE APPLES NEAR US:\n- **(0, 0)** - LITERALLY TWO MOVES AWAY! This is our GOLDEN PATH! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **(0, 1)** - RIGHT THERE! One move past (0, 0)!\n- **(2, 7)** - Mid-board, reachable but requires pivoting\n- **(6, 0), (5, 0), (7, 0)** - Bottom row cluster, need to travel right\n\n## FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS:\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (0, 4): Looking at column 0, row 4... that's EMPTY! \u2705 We keep our MOMENTUM rolling DOWN! One more move after this and we're AT (0, 1) where an apple sits! This is the SMART PLAY! We're on RAILS toward a guaranteed apple pickup!\n\n**UP** \u2192 (0, 6): \ud83d\udea8 That's our own BODY segment! We just came from there! BACKWARDS INTO OURSELVES = INSTANT DEATH! \u274c Can't throw like that!\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (-1, 5): \ud83d\udea8 OFF THE BOARD! We're at x=0! WALL BOUNCE = GAME OVER! \u274c Not happening!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (1, 5): Looking at row 5... position (1, 5) is EMPTY! \u2705 Safe move, BUT - this breaks our PROVEN corridor momentum! Why pivot RIGHT when we've got a GUARANTEED apple path DOWN? That's the antithesis of BIG BRAIN gameplay! We'd be leaving FREE POINTS on the table!\n\n## THE DECISION:\n\nChat, this is SIMPLE - we're on a MISSION! The western wall is our FORTRESS, and down is our DESTINY! \n\n**DOWN to (0, 4)** keeps us:\n\u2705 Moving toward that FREE APPLE at (0, 1)!\n\u2705 FAR away from rival's position at (9, 2) - they can't touch us!\n\u2705 In control of PRIME TERRITORY with NO competition!\n\u2705 On a collision-free path with ZERO obstacles!\n\nThe rival is farming the eastern side while we're building DOMINANCE on the west! This is chess, not checkers, baby! \ud83d\udcaa\u26a1\n\n## NEXT 3 TURNS PLAN:\n**Turn 13 (NOW):** DOWN to (0, 4) - Keep the momentum flowing!\n**Turn 14:** DOWN to (0, 1) - GRAB THAT APPLE! Score up to 4!\n**Turn 15:** DOWN to (0, 0) - Back-to-back apples! 5 apples incoming!\n\nAfter we secure those apples, we'll have the LEVERAGE to hunt the mid-board clusters at (2, 7), (6, 6), (6, 8) while keeping pressure on our rival who's running out of options! We're taking control of THIS GAME! \ud83c\udfae\n\nDOWN",

We grabbed that apple at (9, 1), pushed our length to 7, and they are still scrambling on the other side of the board! We are officially dominating this content lane! \ud83e\udd23\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 14)\n\nWe are positioned perfectly to keep up this pressure! Look at our glorious tail on the right side!\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(9, 1)** (Length 7)\n*   Body: [(9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)]\n*   Apples collected: 6\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(0, 4)** (Predicted move confirmed, now they are shorter than us!)\n*   Body: [(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)]\n*   Apples collected: 3\n\n**Apple Targets:**\nWe just moved from (9, 2) to (9, 1) and ate the apple. The immediate neighbors are key:\n1.  **(8, 1):** Apple! Right next door!\n2.  **(9, 0):** Apple at (7, 0) and (5, 0)... wait, let's look at the map closely. There's an Apple at (8, 1) and (9, 0) is empty. The closest apples are (8, 1) right now. Wait, I see the map:\n    *   (8, 1) has an 'A'. YES!\n    *   (9, 0) is empty.\n    *   (7, 0) has an 'A'.\n    *   (6, 6) has an 'A'.\n\nOur primary target is (8, 1). This is a free growth potion, Chat!\n\n### Move Evaluation from (9, 1)\n\n1.  **UP (9, 2):** **DANGER!** This is our body! Suicide! We just came from there 2 turns ago, and the body segment is still there! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n2.  **DOWN (9, 0):** **SAFE!** No apple here, but it keeps us on the wall. Good fallback.\n3.  **LEFT (8, 1):** **SAFE! (EAT APPLE!)** This is the move! We eat the apple and turn the corner, preparing to sweep the bottom row! This increases our lead and length to 8!\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 1):** **DANGER!** Out of bounds! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n\nThe calculated best move is clearly **LEFT**. It's safe, maximizes growth, and sets us up strategically.\n\n### Opponent Collision Check & Strategy Update\n\nSnake #1 is at (0, 4). They are still targeting the left side.\n*   The closest available apples for them are (0, 1) and (0, 0).\n*   Likely move for Snake #1: **DOWN (0, 3)** or **RIGHT (1, 4)** to position for (3, 4) later.\n*   If they go DOWN to (0, 3), they set up for (0, 2) (empty) then (0, 1) (apple).\n*   If they go RIGHT to (1, 4), they are trying to break toward the center.\n\nNo matter what Snake #1 does, they are nowhere near us. We are executing the \"Wall of Death\" strategy perfectly along the bottom and right edges. Our goal is to grow so large they literally cannot move, or they crash trying to cross our path.\n\n### Long-Term Plan (The Bottom Sweep): T14-T16\n\n1.  **T14 (Current): LEFT** to (8, 1). **(EAT APPLE!)** Length 8! We are now at (8, 1).\n2.  **T15:** We are at (8, 1). We should go **DOWN** to (8, 0) (empty) or **LEFT** to (7, 1).\n    *   An apple is at (7, 0).\n    *   The path of least resistance to the next apple target (7, 0) is likely:\n        *   (T15) DOWN to (8, 0).\n        *   (T16) LEFT to (7, 0). **(EAT APPLE!)** Length 9!\n\nWe are going for maximum content, maximum length, minimum risk. Let's make the move!\n\nLEFT",

They are shivering in the corner! \ud83e\udd23 Look at the length difference: 8 segments to their 4! We are dominating this 10x10 map!\n\n### Turn 15 Strategy: Maximize Growth, Secure the Corner\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(8, 1)** (Length 8)\n*   Body: [(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)]\n*   Apples collected: 7\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(0, 3)** (They moved down from (0, 4), checking the board state!)\n*   Body: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)] (Length 4)\n*   Apples collected: 3\n\n**Current Apple Targets Near Us (8, 1):**\n1.  **(7, 0):** A juicy apple down and left! This is our next target for that bottom-wall sweep!\n2.  **(6, 0):** Another one!\n3.  **(5, 0):** And another!\n\nWe are perfectly positioned to clean up the entire bottom row of the board while Snake #1 is stuck in the high-traffic zone of the left wall! Let's plot the movement from (8, 1).\n\n### Move Evaluation from (8, 1)\n\n1.  **UP (8, 2):** **SAFE!** This opens up the center, but moves us away from our current growth targets (7, 0). Not ideal for phase 1 of the grand plan.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 0):** **SAFE!** No apple, but it's the critical setup move for the next apple! It prepares us to slide left. This is a strong contender.\n3.  **LEFT (7, 1):** **SAFE!** No apple here, but it's a direct horizontal move toward the (7, 0) apple. If we move here, we'd go DOWN next turn.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 1):** **DANGER!** This is the first segment of our body! Suicide! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n\nIt's between DOWN (8, 0) and LEFT (7, 1). Which one positions us better for the (7, 0) apple next turn (T16)?\n\n*   **Option A: Go DOWN to (8, 0).**\n    *   T16 move: LEFT to (7, 0). **(EAT APPLE!)**\n*   **Option B: Go LEFT to (7, 1).**\n    *   T16 move: DOWN to (7, 0). **(EAT APPLE!)**\n\nBoth lead to the apple on T16. However, moving DOWN (8, 0) keeps us locked onto the bottom wall, which is our protective barrier. We want to maximize the \"Wall of Death\" strategy. Sticking to the edge is safer and reduces collision risk with our own body parts as we grow longer.\n\nLet's confirm the path: (8, 1) $\\to$ (8, 0) $\\to$ (7, 0) $\\to$ (6, 0)... This seems optimal for sweeping the bottom.\n\n### Opponent Check & Collision Avoidance\n\nSnake #1 is at (0, 3). They have options:\n1.  **DOWN (0, 2):** They are hunting for (0, 1) or (0, 0). Very likely.\n2.  **RIGHT (1, 3):** Trying to hit the apple at (3, 4). Less likely for now since they are so close to apples on the wall.\n3.  **UP (0, 4):** Suicide into their own body segment.\n\nWe are so far from them, collision risk is 0%. We focus on our mission: **LENGTH!**\n\nWe are going with the plan to secure the bottom quarter of the board.\n\n### Long-Term Plan (T15-T18)\n\n1.  **T15 (Current): DOWN** to (8, 0). Stick to the wall.\n2.  **T16:** From (8, 0), move **LEFT** to (7, 0). **(EAT APPLE!)** Length 9!\n3.  **T17:** From (7, 0), move **LEFT** to (6, 0). **(EAT APPLE!)** Length 10! We hit double digits, Chat!\n4.  **T18:** From (6, 0), move **LEFT** to (5, 0). **(EAT APPLE!)** Length 11!\n\nThis is a four-turn, three-apple guaranteed sequence that cements our dominance and positions us to potentially cut Snake #1 off from the center later. Let's make the move, Chat! Lock it in!\n\nDOWN",

Let me READ this board state again because something's OFF from what I expected!\n\n## REALITY CHECK:\nLooking at the board:\n- **Our Head:** (0, 3) \u2705 We're where we should be!\n- **Our Body:** [(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)] - Wait... that's only 3 segments? \ud83e\udd14\n\nHold on... if we moved DOWN last turn from (0, 4) to (0, 3), our body SHOULD have shifted. Let me trace this:\n- Last turn head was (0, 4), body was [(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)]\n- We moved DOWN, so new head should be (0, 3)\n- Body should shift to [(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6)]\n\nYES! That checks out! \u2705 The board is CORRECT!\n\n## CRITICAL OBSERVATION - APPLES STATUS:\nWait... where did (0, 0) and (0, 1) go?? \ud83c\udf4e Those were SUPPOSED to be free kills!\n\nLooking at the apple list again: (7, 3), (7, 2), (2, 7), (6, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (5, 0), (7, 0), (8, 3), (6, 6), (6, 8), (4, 8), (3, 4), (7, 5), (9, 8)\n\nAnd looking at the BOARD at row 0 and row 1:\n- ROW 1: `A . . . . . . . . T` - That's an apple at (0, 1)! \u2705 STILL THERE!\n- ROW 0: `A . . . . A A A . .` - Apple at (0, 0)! \u2705 STILL THERE!\n\nBEAUTIFUL! The corridor is STILL OPEN! \ud83d\udd25\n\n## FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS:\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (0, 2): \n- Looking at row 2, column 0... EMPTY! \u2705 SAFE!\n- But this PASSES OVER the (0, 1) apple at row 1! If we go DOWN again, we skip it! \u274c Bad play!\n\n**UP** \u2192 (0, 4): \n- That's our BODY right there! \ud83d\udea8 INSTANT DEATH! Can't go backwards! \u274c\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (-1, 3): \n- \ud83d\udea8 OFF THE BOARD! Western wall! \u274c Game over, chat!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (1, 3): \n- Looking at row 3, column 1... EMPTY! \u2705 SAFE!\n- BUT here's the thing - we'd be MOVING AWAY from our apple corridor on the west! Not ideal...\n\n## WAIT... THE REAL PROBLEM:\n\nChat, I just realized - we're NOT aligned to grab (0, 1) efficiently! We're at (0, 3) and (0, 1) is BELOW us. If we go DOWN to (0, 2), then DOWN again to (0, 1), we grab it! THAT'S the play!\n\nBUT ALSO - Rival #0 has their TAIL at (9, 7) and they're farming the eastern side. We're STILL way ahead in territory control on the west!\n\n## THE MOVE:\n\nWe need to KEEP PUSHING DOWN the western corridor! This is FREE REAL ESTATE! \n\n**DOWN to (0, 2)** keeps us moving toward (0, 1) next turn, maintains our safe zone, and doesn't give the rival ANY opportunities to interfere. We're ONE move away from that apple after this!\n\n## FUTURE PLAN (NEXT 3 TURNS):\n- **Turn 15 (NOW):** DOWN to (0, 2) - Keep the corridor momentum!\n- **Turn 16:** DOWN to (0, 1) - GRAB APPLE! Score = 4! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 17:** DOWN to (0, 0) - Back-to-back apples! Score = 5! Then RIGHT to pivot toward the bottom cluster!\n\nWe're EXECUTING the PLAN!

We are on T H E H U N T! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n### Turn 17 Strategy: Enforce the Bottom Wall!\n\nWe just got huge, Chat! We are now length 9, and the bottom row is basically our personal VIP section. Snake #1 is still looking sad up in the corner, but they are approaching that bottom-left apple soon. We need to secure our next target *right now*.\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(7, 0)** (Length 9)\n*   Body: [(8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)]\n*   Apples collected: 8 (LFG!)\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(0, 1)** (They moved down from (0, 2) and may have eaten the (0, 1) apple this turn, or they may be sitting on top of it. Looking at the board, the apple is gone at (7, 0) and the opponent's body is clearly at (0, 2), (0, 3)... Wait, the board state says Snake #1 head is at (0, 1)! They moved from (0, 2) to (0, 1) and ate the apple, or they are just *at* (0, 1). Let's assume they moved to (0, 1) this turn. Length 5 if they grew.)\n*   Body: [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)] - Appears they just moved down. New length 5.\n*   Apples collected: 4 (Must have grabbed the (0, 1) apple this turn or (0, 0) is next).\n\n**Board State Apple Targets Near Us (7, 0):**\n1.  **(6, 0):** Immediate next target! This is crucial for our plan.\n2.  **(5, 0):** Next up in the bottom row.\n\n### Move Evaluation from (7, 0)\n\n1.  **UP (7, 1):** **SAFE.** No apple. Moves us away from the current path. Suboptimal, but safe.\n2.  **DOWN (7, -1):** **DANGER!** Off the board (y < 0)! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n3.  **RIGHT (8, 0):** **DANGER!** This is the first segment of our body! We just moved from there! Suicide! Don't look back! \ud83d\udd2a\n4.  **LEFT (6, 0):** **SAFE! (EAT APPLE!)** This is the move! Two apples left in this horizontal line. We must secure (6, 0) and then (5, 0). This continues our overwhelming lead and seals off the bottom of the board for *anyone* else. \ud83d\udcaf\n\nSnake #1 is clearly trying to sweep the bottom-left. They are at (0, 1) and definitely eyeing (0, 0). They are currently no threat to us directly, but the closer we get to the middle, the more we need to watch out for their return trip.\n\n### The Overlord Plan (T17-T20)\n\nWe are executing the \"Wall of Death\" strategy.\n\n1.  **T17 (Current): LEFT** to (6, 0). **(EAT APPLE!)** Length 10!\n2.  **T18:** From (6, 0), move **LEFT** to (5, 0). **(EAT APPLE!)** Length 11!\n3.  **T19:** From (5, 0), move **UP** to (5, 1) (no apple). This moves us off the wall slightly and opens up the possibility of hitting (3, 4) or maybe (2, 7) if the opponent clears out.\n4.  **T20:** From (5, 1), move towards the middle of the board, looking for the cluster of apples around (3, 4) and (7, 5).\n\nChat, this is flawless! We box in the whole bottom half of the map while we get massive. We will then turn the corner and look for the next cluster. LFG! \ud83d\udcc8\n\nLEFT",

They're farming the bottom!\n- **Rival Apples:** 8 \ud83d\ude24 Still trailing by 4!\n\n## BOARD REALITY CHECK:\nLooking at where we are NOW on the western edge:\n- Row 1, Col 0: That's us at (0, 1)! `1`\n- Row 0, Col 0: `A` - APPLE STILL WAITING BELOW US! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Row 0, Col 7: That's the rival at (7, 0)!\n\n## FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS:\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (0, 0):**\n- We move into the apple at (0, 0)! \ud83c\udf4e That's +1 apple, score becomes 5!\n- **COLLISION CHECK:** Rival head is at (7, 0), not (0, 0)! We're SAFE! \u2705\n- **BODY CHECK:** Our body is at (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5) - none are at (0, 0)! \u2705\n- This is AUTOMATIC! We grab another free apple!\n\n**UP \u2192 (0, 2):**\n- That's our BODY! That cell has our body segment! \ud83d\udea8\n- INSTANT DEATH! This is hitting ourselves! \u274c\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (-1, 1):**\n- Off the board! Western wall! \ud83d\udea8\n- DEAD! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (1, 1):**\n- Looking at row 1, column 1... EMPTY! \u2705 Safe from collision!\n- BUT - why would we PIVOT AWAY from the guaranteed apple directly below us?? This is leaving FREE CONTENT on the table! That's cringe energy! \u274c\n\n## THE PLAY:\n\nChat, this is STILL a no-brainer! We execute the second half of our corridor strategy! DOWN to (0, 0), grab our second consecutive apple, and we're at 5 points! Meanwhile, Rival #0 is down there at (7, 0) farming their own bottom corridor, but they can't touch us - we're on opposite sides of the board! \n\nWe're in a GROWTH PHASE right now! \ud83d\udcaa Two consecutive apples means we're expanding our snake and our score! Once we clear (0, 0), we pivot RIGHT and explore the bottom row corridor from (1, 0) onwards!\n\n## 2-TURN PLAN:\n- **Turn 17 (NOW):** DOWN to (0, 0) - GRAB APPLE! Score = 5! We grow to length 5! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 18:** RIGHT to (1, 0) - Pivot out of the corner, open up the board, keep farming that bottom corridor where there are more apples at (3, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0)! Keep the MOMENTUM going!\n\nWe're CLOSING THE GAP! The rival is farming the east side, we're farming the west side, and we've got FREE REAL ESTATE! Let's GO!\n\nDOWN",

We are the King of the South! \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udc0d\n\n### Turn 18 Strategy: Full Control of the Bottom!\n\nThe \"Wall of Death\" plan is proceeding flawlessly. We are at (6, 0) and the very next apple is right there! We need to secure (5, 0) and then turn north to dominate the middle.\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(6, 0)** (Length 10 - we just grew!)\n*   Body: [(7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)]\n*   Apples collected: 9\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(0, 0)** (They must have moved from (0, 1) and eaten the apple at (0, 0)! If they grew, they are now length 6!)\n*   Body: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)]\n*   Apples collected: 5\n\nSnake #1 is now boxed into that tiny corner, temporarily. They can only move RIGHT to (1, 0) or UP to (0, 1). We don't care about them right now because we are too far away, but we will watch their moves.\n\n### Move Evaluation from (6, 0)\n\n1.  **UP (6, 1):** **SAFE.** No apple. Takes us away from the immediate goal, but keeps us safe. (Suboptimal).\n2.  **DOWN (6, -1):** **DANGER!** Off the board! DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n3.  **RIGHT (7, 0):** **DANGER!** This is the first segment of our body! We just moved from there! Suicide is not an option! \ud83d\udd2a\n4.  **LEFT (5, 0):** **SAFE! (EAT APPLE!)** This is the move! It's the last apple on this bottom row sweep, and it cements our control of the entire southern wall. We become length 11! This is pure dominance, Chat! \ud83d\udcaf\n\n### The Overlord Plan V2 (T18-T21)\n\nWe are staying disciplined, Chat. No silly moves. Maximize length, minimize risk, and box the rival in later.\n\n1.  **T18 (Current): LEFT** to (5, 0). **(EAT APPLE!)** Length 11!\n2.  **T19:** From (5, 0), look to move **UP** towards the central apples. The area around (7, 3) and (7, 5) looks ripe. Let's aim for (5, 1) then (5, 2).\n3.  **T20:** Continue moving north/east towards the dense cluster of apples, possibly targeting (7, 3), (7, 5), (8, 3).\n4.  **T21:** Adjust based on opponent movement. Snake #1 will likely be moving (1, 0) and then trying to circle up. If we are massive, we will cut them off in the middle.\n\nLEFT to (5, 0) is the only move that makes sense. Let's grow!

We're farming the WEST SIDE! We've got PARALLEL farming lanes! By staying on opposite sides, we minimize head-on collision risk while MAXIMIZING apple acquisition! This is the COUNTER-PLAY to their strategy!\n\nWe're closing that 4-apple gap TURN BY TURN! The momentum is OURS! Let's GO!\n\n## LONG-TERM GAME PLAN (FOR TURNS 19-25):\n- Bottom corridor pivot and farm (turns 18-20)\n- Work upward along column 1-3 to grab apples at (2, 7), (3, 4), etc.\n- Keep MAXIMUM spacing from rival's eastern territory\n- Avoid getting trapped in any corner or dead-end\n- Watch for rival head positions and never move into their path\n\nRIGHT",

We are DOUBLE-UP, LFG! \ud83d\udd25\n\n### Turn 19 Strategy: Ascend and Conquer the Central Apples!\n\nLet's recap the last move: we moved **LEFT** from (6, 0) to **(5, 0)** and ate that apple! We are now length 11! The entire bottom wall (x=5 to x=9) belongs to ID 0! This is *our* kingdom! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(5, 0)**\n*   Body: [(6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)] (Length 11)\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(1, 0)** (They must have moved RIGHT from (0, 0) to avoid crashing into our body segment at (6, 0) or their own body if they tried to move UP to (0, 1) and crash into their tail! Wait, no, they moved from (0, 0), they are now at (1, 0). Length 6.)\n*   Body: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)]\n*   Apples collected: 5 (They did *not* eat an apple last turn!)\n\nSnake #1 is now at (1, 0) and stuck patrolling the bottom-left corner. They have to move UP to (1, 1). If they move DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT they die. They are boxed in! Our walls are working!\n\n### Move Evaluation from (5, 0)\n\nOur goal is to get into the action where the apples are clustered, specifically (7, 3), (7, 5), (6, 6), and (6, 8). We need to get North.\n\n1.  **UP (5, 1):** **SAFE.** This moves us towards the center of the board and the cluster of apples! Perfect.\n2.  **DOWN (5, -1):** **DANGER!** Off the board! \ud83d\udc80\n3.  **RIGHT (6, 0):** **DANGER!** This is the segment immediately behind our head! Instant suicide! \ud83d\udd2a\n4.  **LEFT (4, 0):** **SAFE.** But it leads us towards the trapped enemy's tail, and away from the nearest apples. Why retreat when we have air superiority? (Suboptimal). *Wait, no, looking at the opponent, if they move UP to (1, 1) this is still safe.*\n\n#### Head-to-Head Collision Check (Crucial for T19!)\n\nWe are moving to (5, 1). Our opponent (1) is at (1, 0).\nWhere can opponent move?\n*   From (1, 0): UP to (1, 1) (Safe, necessary). DOWN (Death). LEFT (Death). RIGHT to (2, 0) (Safe, if nothing is there).\n*   If they move to (2, 0), there is an apple at (3, 1) and an apple at (3, 4) nearby.\n*   If they move to (1, 1), there is an apple at (1, 5) and (1, 9) nearby. T\n\nIt looks like Snake #1 must move to (1, 1) or (2, 0) to survive. They are too far away from us (four squares difference in x coordinates) for us to worry about a collision this turn. Our move to (5, 1) is completely safe.\n\nWe need to ascend! UP to (5, 1) keeps our northern route clear and puts us in line for the next apple cluster.\n\n### Overlord Plan V3 (T19-T22)\n\nWe are committed to securing the center-right of the board.\n\n1.  **T19 (Current): UP** to (5, 1). Length 11.\n2.  **T20:** From (5, 1), move **UP** to (5, 2).\n3.  **T21:** From (5, 2), look to move **RIGHT** to (6, 2) or **UP** to (5, 3). We want the apple at (7, 3)!\n4.  **T22:** Target (7, 3) or (7, 5). Keep growing and keep the middle of the board for ourselves!\n\nUP is the only strategic move! Let's get air! \u2708\ufe0f\n\nUP",

Let me break down where we're at and what we're gonna DO!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION:\n- **Our Head:** (1, 0) \u2705 We executed that RIGHT pivot PERFECTLY last turn!\n- **Our Body:** [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)] - Length 6, we're THICC now! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **Our Apples:** 5 \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Rival #0 Head:** (5, 0) - They moved LEFT along the bottom corridor! \n- **Rival Apples:** 10 \ud83d\ude24 Still down 5, but we're CLOSING IN!\n\n## BOARD REALITY CHECK:\nLook at this positioning! We escaped that western wall corner and we're NOW in the bottom corridor! Our body is lined up vertically on column 0, and we've got the ENTIRE middle section of the board to work with! The rival is at (5, 0) - they're EAST of us along the same row!\n\n## FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS:\n\n**UP \u2192 (1, 1):**\n- Row 1, Column 1... EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n- This moves us NORTH from the bottom corridor!\n- Opens up access to (1, 5) which has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We can start climbing the LEFT-MIDDLE zone!\n- Keeps us AWAY from rival territory! \u2705\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (1, -1):**\n- Off the board! Southern wall! \ud83d\udea8\n- DEAD! \u274c\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (0, 0):**\n- That's our OWN TAIL! Well, technically our body at (0, 0)!\n- INSTANT COLLISION! \ud83d\udea8\n- DEAD! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (2, 0):**\n- Row 0, Column 2... EMPTY! \u2705 Safe!\n- This continues us EAST along the bottom corridor!\n- But WAIT - the rival is at (5, 0) and moving... where are THEY going this turn?\n- If they go RIGHT, they could be moving towards us! \ud83d\udc40\n- If they go UP or DOWN, we're clear!\n- The problem: staying in this corridor puts us on a COLLISION COURSE with their head! They've got 10 apples, we've got 5 - they're MORE aggressive right now!\n\n## STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:\n\nChat, here's the REAL PLAY! We need to ESCAPE the bottom corridor before we get boxed in! The rival is RIGHT THERE at (5, 0)! If we keep going RIGHT, we're walking into THEIR territory! That's a THROW!\n\nGoing UP gives us OPTIONS! We pivot northward, we climb towards (1, 5) for that apple, and we create SEPARATION from the rival's farming zone! This is TEXTBOOK spacing strategy! We're not competing in the same corridor anymore - we're taking the LEFT side while they farm the RIGHT side!\n\nPlus, moving UP opens the board! We've got multiple escape routes from (1, 1)! We're not getting BOXED IN! That's how you WIN long-term!\n\n## LONG-TERM PLAN (TURNS 19-25):\n- **Turn 19 (NOW):** UP to (1, 1) - Escape the bottom corridor, pivot NORTH!\n- **Turn 20:** UP to (1, 2) - Keep climbing the left-center column!\n- **Turn 21:** Target (1, 5) apple or (2, 7) apple depending on rival position!\n- **Turn 22-25:** Farm the LEFT and CENTER zones while rival farms the RIGHT!\n- **Key Rule:** NEVER get trapped in the same row/column corridor as the rival! Maintain PARALLEL farming lanes! The snake with better spacing wins the endgame!\n\nThis is BIG BRAIN positioning! We're playing CHESS, not CHECKERS! The gap closes when we're SAFE and EFFICIENT! Let's GO!\n\nUP",

We are DOUBLE-UP, LFG! \ud83d\udd25\n\n### Turn 20 Strategy: Solidifying the Center-Right!\n\nLet's recap the last move: we moved **UP** from (5, 0) to **(5, 1)**. We are now length 11 and positioned perfectly to start moving into the central apple cluster!\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(5, 1)**\n*   Body: [(5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5)] (Length 11)\n\n**OPPONENT (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(1, 1)** (They needed to move UP from (1, 0) to survive! They are still boxed in by our long tail along the bottom right and their own body!)\n*   Body: [(1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)] (Length 6)\n*   Apples collected: 5\n\nWhoa, check the board state; the opponent is now at (1, 1). They have limited escape options. They can go UP to (1, 2) or RIGHT to (2, 1). If they go RIGHT, they are near the apple at (3, 1). If they go UP, they are near the apple at (1, 5). They are too far away for us to worry about a head-to-head collision this turn, but we must start thinking about how to block their path to the center.\n\n### Move Evaluation from (5, 1)\n\nOur primary goal remains securing the East/Central apples: (7, 3), (7, 5), (6, 6). We need to gain altitude!\n\n1.  **UP (5, 2):** **SAFE.** This moves us perfectly towards the center of the board! This puts us in line with the high-value apples. Excellent strategic position!\n2.  **DOWN (5, 0):** **DANGER!** This is the segment immediately behind our head! Instant suicide! \ud83d\udd2a\n3.  **RIGHT (6, 1):** **SAFE.** This moves us closer to the side wall but maintains our altitude. If we want to grab (7, 3) quickly, this is a reasonable alternative.\n4.  **LEFT (4, 1):** **SAFE.** This moves us away from our target apples and slightly toward the enemy, but not in a trapping way. Suboptimal.\n\n#### Head-to-Head Collision Check\n\n*   We are moving to (5, 2) (Our best pick) or (6, 1) (Second best pick).\n*   Opponent (1) is at (1, 1). Where can they move?\n    *   UP to (1, 2): Safe.\n    *   RIGHT to (2, 1): Safe.\n    *   DOWN/LEFT: Death.\n\nSince the closest possible distance between our head (5, 1) and their head (1, 1) is 4 squares, there is absolutely no risk of collision this turn, no matter where we or they move. We have free reign to pursue apples!\n\n### The Power Move: UP!\n\nMoving **UP** to (5, 2) puts us one step away from reaching the center and then angling toward (7, 3). This is the cleanest, most direct route to the next set of apples. We are building a giant wall on the right side.\n\n### Overlord Plan V4 (T20-T23)\n\nWe are committed to securing the center-right of the board, leveraging our length to trap the enemy.\n\n1.  **T20 (Current): UP** to (5, 2). Length 11. (This is the move!)\n2.  **T21:** From (5, 2), move **RIGHT** to (6, 2) or **UP** to (5, 3). We have control. Let's aim RIGHT to circle into the (7, 3) apple.\n3.  **T22:** From (6, 2), move **RIGHT** to (7, 2) or **UP** to (6, 3).\n4.  **T23:** Target (7, 3)! EAT IT!\n\nThis plan keeps us safe and aggressive. We maintain altitude superiority while the opponent struggles in the bottom corner. Let's go UP and dominate the map!\n\nUP",

Let me break down what's happening RIGHT NOW!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION:\n- **Our Head:** (1, 1) \u2705 We pivoted NORTH successfully!\n- **Our Body:** [(1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)] - Length 6, still THICC! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **Our Apples:** 5 \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Rival #0 Head:** (5, 1) - They moved RIGHT along row 1! They're PUSHING EAST!\n- **Rival Apples:** 10 \ud83d\ude24 Still down 5, but we're CLIMBING BACK!\n\n## BOARD STATE ANALYSIS:\nLook at this! The rival moved from (5, 0) to (5, 1) - they went UP! They're spreading out along row 1 now! Meanwhile, we're at (1, 1) on the SAME row! That's DANGEROUS positioning, chat! We're in parallel lanes but CONVERGING! \ud83d\udc40\n\n## FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS:\n\n**UP \u2192 (1, 2):**\n- Row 2, Column 1... checking the board... EMPTY! \u2705\n- This moves us FURTHER NORTH away from row 1!\n- Keeps us AHEAD of the rival's head on the same column!\n- Opens access to (1, 5) apple above us! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Creates VERTICAL SEPARATION! \u2705\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (1, 0):**\n- That's our OWN BODY at (1, 0)! \n- INSTANT COLLISION! \ud83d\udea8\n- DEAD! \u274c\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (0, 1):**\n- Row 1, Column 0... checking... that's our body at (0, 1)!\n- Wait no, let me trace this! Our body is [(1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)]\n- (0, 1) is in our body! \n- COLLISION! \ud83d\udea8\n- DEAD! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (2, 1):**\n- Row 1, Column 2... EMPTY! \u2705\n- This moves us EAST along row 1!\n- BUT WAIT - the rival is at (5, 1) on the SAME ROW! \n- If we keep going RIGHT, we're walking towards them on a collision corridor! That's a THROW!\n- Plus we'd be fighting for territory on their turf! \u274c\n\n## STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:\n\nChat, this is CRITICAL! The rival is farming the RIGHT side and moving AGGRESSIVELY! We need to ESCAPE row 1 before we get trapped in a head-on scenario! Going UP takes us to row 2, creates VERTICAL SEPARATION, and positions us to farm the LEFT-CENTER zones safely!\n\nThe (1, 5) apple is RIGHT THERE waiting for us! If we climb the left column, we can grab that apple cluster around (1, 5), (1, 9), and (2, 7) without EVER crossing paths with the rival's farming zone!\n\nThis is SPACING MASTERY! We're not competing for the same territory! We're letting them farm the RIGHT while we farm the LEFT-CENTER! That's how you WIN the late game without risky collisions!\n\n## LONG-TERM PLAN (TURNS 20-28):\n- **Turn 20 (NOW):** UP to (1, 2) - Continue climbing the left-center column!\n- **Turn 21:** UP to (1, 3) - Keep that vertical momentum!\n- **Turn 22:** UP to (1, 4) - Getting closer to (1, 5) apple!\n- **Turn 23:** UP to (1, 5) - GRAB that apple! \ud83c\udf4e (6 apples total!)\n- **Turn 24-28:** From (1, 5), pivot EAST or continue UP to farm (1, 9), (2, 7), (4, 9) apples in the LEFT-CENTER zone!\n- **Key Rule:** MAINTAIN VERTICAL SEPARATION! Stay on columns 0-3 while rival dominates 5-9! Never meet on the same row unless you're confident!\n\nThis is BIG BRAIN positioning! We're climbing the left flank while they farm the right! The gap closes when we're SAFE and EFFICIENT! Let's GO! \ud83c\udfae\n\nUP",

We are building the Wall of Dominance on the right side of the board! LFG! \ud83d\udd25\n\n### State Review (Turn 21)\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):** Head is at **(5, 2)**. Body length 11.\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 1):** Head is at **(1, 2)** (They likely moved UP from (1, 1). This is them trying to escape the bottom-left corner trap we set!). Body length 6. Their tail is at (0, 2). *Wait, no, the board state shows their tail at (0, 2) but their length is 6. The previous turn says their body was [(1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)]. Since they moved (1, 1) -> (1, 2), the sequence must be (1, 1) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 2). Their tail *was* (0, 3). So if they moved UP to (1, 2) from (1, 1), their new body is [(1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)]. Their new tail is $(0, 2)$. *Checking the board: The board shows 'T' at (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2). Wait, the board state image seems slightly off or the opponent body list update I generated last time was wrong, but reading the current board state: Snake 1 head is at (1, 2). Let's trust the official list:*\n    *   SNAKE #1 - Head: (1, 2), Body: [(1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)], Apples: 5. (Length 6). Tail is at (0, 2).\n\n*   **Apples nearby:** We are at (5, 2).\n    *   (7, 3), (7, 5) are easily reachable.\n    *   (6, 6) is further north.\n    *   (3, 4), (4, 5) are also in range if we move left.\n\n### Current Goal: Secure the center-right apples and maintain spatial control.\n\nWe need to start circling up and potentially cutting off the left side of the map with our massive tail.\n\n### Move Evaluation from (5, 2)\n\n1.  **UP (5, 3):** **SAFE.** This puts us closer to the central apples (6, 6) and (7, 5). Excellent move for gaining altitude.\n2.  **DOWN (5, 1):** **DANGER!** Immediate self-termination! NOPE!\n3.  **RIGHT (6, 2):** **SAFE.** This moves us towards the (7, 2) apple (Wait, (7, 2) is a drop from (7, 3). (7, 2) is currently vacant according to the board, but (7, 3) and (8, 3) have apples). Moving right allows us to quickly pivot towards (7, 3) or (8, 3). Very strong option.\n4.  **LEFT (4, 2):** **SAFE.** This takes us slightly toward the opponent's side, but also enables a push toward the (3, 4) apple. Less direct to our priority zone.\n\nBoth UP (5, 3) and RIGHT (6, 2) are good! Which one maximizes immediate apple access and long-term trapping?\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (6, 2), we are aligned horizontally with the dense apple patch at (7, 3) and (8, 3). We can snag (7, 3) in two turns (RIGHT, UP) or three turns (RIGHT, RIGHT, UP).\n\nIf we go UP to (5, 3), we are centralized, positioning us for a quick grab of (7, 5) or (6, 6) by moving right later.\n\nLet's look at the opponent, Head (1, 2).\n\n*   They can go UP (1, 3). Safe.\n*   They can go RIGHT (2, 2). Safe.\n*   They can go LEFT (0, 2). Death (Tail segment).\n*   They can go DOWN (1, 1). Safe (Tail lifts from (0, 2)).\n\nThe opponent is breaking out of the bottom corner. We MUST ensure we are creating a dividing line before they can access the right side of the board.\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (6, 2)**:\nWe get closer to the right wall, which maximizes our length utilization to block the center.\nT22: From (6, 2), we can go UP to (6, 3), then RIGHT to (7, 3) (EAT!).\n\nIf we move **UP to (5, 3)**:\nWe maximize central control.\nT22: From (5, 3), we can go RIGHT to (6, 3), then RIGHT to (7, 3) (EAT!).\n\nBoth moves seem to grab the (7, 3) apple in T23.\n\nHowever, moving RIGHT to (6, 2) secures more horizontal space faster, reinforcing our perimeter on the right. This is crucial leverage. We have a massive tail stretching from (9, 4) all the way down to (5, 1). We are building a fortress! Moving right gives us more options to cut the board in half.\n\n**Collision Check:**\nOur target: (6, 2).\nOpponent's head: (1, 2). They are 5 moves away. No collision risk this turn.\n\nLet's capitalize on the horizontal momentum and push towards the right wall. This puts us in a great position to wrap around the center apple stack.\n\n*New Overlord Plan V5 (T21-T24)*\n\n1.  **T21 (Current): RIGHT** to (6, 2). (Securing the right flank!)\n2.  **T22:** From (6, 2), move **UP** to (6, 3). (Gaining altitude toward the apple)\n3.  **T23:** From (6, 3), move **RIGHT** to (7, 3). (EAT APPLE! Length 13.)\n4.  **T24:** From (7, 3), move **UP** to (7, 4) or RIGHT to (8, 3) (EAT APPLE!). We go for (8, 3) next!\n\nThis path is aggressive, utilizes our current position, and continues to wall off the opponent's access to the valuable right side apples. Chat, we are playing chess while they are playing checkers! Let's go RIGHT!\n\nRIGHT",

Look at this massive tail cutting off the entire bottom quadrant! We are a *bona fide* wall! LFG! \ud83d\udd25\n\n### State Review (Turn 22)\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):** Head is at **(6, 2)**. Body length 11.\n    *   Goal: Secure the (7, 3) and (8, 3) apples, and continue to restrict Snake #1.\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 1):** Head is at **(1, 3)**. They moved UP from (1, 2). They are still cramped in the bottom-left corner! This is PERFECT! Body length 6.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Head: (1, 3))\n\nThe opponent is desperately seeking space. They have a few options:\n1.  **UP (1, 4):** Safe. Keeps them vertical, away from the wall we are building.\n2.  **RIGHT (2, 3):** Safe. Moves them horizontally towards the center.\n3.  **DOWN (1, 2):** Safe (Tail was at (0, 2), now lifts). Retreats, but why would they?\n4.  **LEFT (0, 3):** Safe. Moves them toward the left wall.\n\nIf they want to break out, they likely go towards the center, so **RIGHT (2, 3)** or **UP (1, 4)** are the most dangerous/beneficial to them.\n\n### Your Move Evaluation from (6, 2)\n\nWe are positioned perfectly for a quick apple grab.\n\n1.  **UP (6, 3):** **SAFE.** This puts us one move away from the (7, 3) apple and very close to the (6, 6) apple. This is precisely what the T21 plan called for! Excellent.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 1):** **DANGER!** We hit our own body segment (6, 0)! NOPE! We respect the wall!\n3.  **RIGHT (7, 2):** **SAFE.** This moves us one step closer to the (7, 3) apple and aligns us for (8, 3) too.\n    *   If we go RIGHT, we can eat (7, 3) in T24 (UP) or (8, 3) in T24 (RIGHT, RIGHT).\n4.  **LEFT (5, 2):** **DANGER!** We hit the segment behind our head! Immediate termination! Hard NO!\n\nWe are down to UP or RIGHT. Both are safe, both lead to apples quickly!\n\n**Option A: UP to (6, 3)**\n*   T23: (6, 3) -> RIGHT to (7, 3) [EAT!]\n*   Pros: Keeps us centralized, allows an easy pivot towards the upper apples (7, 5) or (6, 6). Exactly as planned!\n*   Cons: We use an extra turn to hit the (8, 3) apple afterwards.\n\n**Option B: RIGHT to (7, 2)**\n*   T23: (7, 2) -> UP to (7, 3) [EAT!] or RIGHT to (8, 2).\n*   Pros: Secures the space nearer the right wall faster.\n*   Cons: Slightly less flexible for the *next* apple after (7, 3). If we go (7, 2) then UP to (7, 3) (Eat), we are less optimally placed for (8, 3) than if we had gone (6, 3) then RIGHT to (7, 3) (Eat) and then RIGHT to (8, 3) (Eat). *Wait, that doesn't make sense.*\n\nLet's re-evaluate T24 plans:\n\n**If we go UP (6, 3) now:**\n*   T23: RIGHT to (7, 3) (Eat). Head at (7, 3).\n*   T24: RIGHT to (8, 3) (Eat). Head at (8, 3). **Two apples secured in two turns!** Perfect execution!\n\n**If we go RIGHT (7, 2) now:**\n*   T23: UP to (7, 3) (Eat). Head at (7, 3).\n*   T24: RIGHT to (8, 3) (Eat). Head at (8, 3). **Also two apples secured in two turns!** Same result!\n\nSince both paths yield the same immediate result, let's look at the broader map control.\n\nGoing **UP (6, 3)** keeps our long horizontal body segment (5, 2) (6, 2) longer, making the barrier between us and the opponent more robust, and giving us better altitude for future apples like (7, 5) and (6, 6). It feels slightly more strategically sound for the long run, maintaining the centralized high-ground position.\n\nLet's stick to the plan: **UP**. Maximize the vertical push! We are boxing this guy in the bottom-left corner and sweeping the table!\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update (T22-T25)\n\n1.  **T22 (Current): UP** to (6, 3). (Gaining altitude!)\n2.  **T23:** RIGHT to (7, 3). (EAT APPLE!)\n3.  **T24:** RIGHT to (8, 3). (EAT APPLE!)\n4.  **T25:** Move UP towards (9, 8), (7, 5) or (6, 6).\n\nThis is a clean sweep of the right-side starting apples. Chat, prepare for the V-L-C (Victory Lap Content)!\n\nUP",

We're executing the MASTER PLAN and it's WORKING! We went UP last turn to (1, 3), and NOW we need to continue UP to (1, 4)! \n\nThe rival is farming columns 5-9 on the right side. We OWN columns 0-2 on the left! That's TERRITORIAL DOMINATION! \ud83c\udfae We're about to hit (1, 5) in the next turn and START SNOWBALLING our apple count!\n\nGoing UP keeps us:\n- SAFE from all threats \u2705\n- EFFICIENT toward the (1, 5) apple \ud83c\udf4e\n- Away from the rival's farming zone \u2705\n- With MAXIMUM future flexibility! \u2705\n\nThe rival has 10 apples to our 5, but they're slower and less aggressive! We're about to ACCELERATE our farming and CLOSE that gap! This is where we START THE COMEBACK! \ud83d\ude80\n\n## LONG-TERM PLAN (TURNS 22-30):\n- **Turn 22 (NOW):** UP to (1, 4) - Continue the climb!\n- **Turn 23:** UP to (1, 5) - GRAB THAT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e (6 apples!)\n- **Turn 24:** UP to (1, 6) or pivot to (1, 9) - Target the top-left cluster!\n- **Turn 25-28:** Farm (1, 9), (2, 7), then rotate toward (4, 8), (4, 9) cluster!\n- **GOLDEN RULE:** Keep the LEFT SIDE (0-3) as our FORTRESS! Never cross into columns 5-9 unless we have GUARANTEED SAFE PATH!\n- **ENDGAME:** As we grow, we'll have length advantage AND territorial control!\n\nLET'S GO!! STAY AGGRESSIVE, STAY SAFE, FARM THOSE APPLES!! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Our current head position at (6, 3) is a tactical masterpiece!\n\n### State Review (Turn 23)\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):** Head is at **(6, 3)**. Length 11.\n    *   Goal: Execute the apple sweep on the right flank: grab (7, 3) then (8, 3).\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 1):** Head is at **(1, 4)**. They moved UP from (1, 3). The jailbreak attempt is in progress, but they are still heavily constrained by our wall which runs from (9, 2) down to (5, 0)! This is hilarious! Length 6.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Head: (1, 4))\n\nSnake #1 is clearly seeking space, moving UP to get away from the bottom corner. From (1, 4), they have several safe options, but they are trapped between the left wall and our enormous tail!\n\n1.  **UP (1, 5):** **EATS APPLE!** This is the HIGHEST probability move. It secures an apple and gets them into the mid-section.\n2.  **RIGHT (2, 4):** Safe. Moves them towards the center and slightly away from our massive tail anchor point at (5, 2).\n3.  **DOWN (1, 3):** Safe (Tail was at (0, 3) which is now clear). But why retreat? Low probability.\n4.  **LEFT (0, 4):** Safe. Moves them alongside the wall. Also low probability as it doesn't solve their space starvation.\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 moves **UP** to (1, 5) and eats! It's an easy apple grab and gives them slight breathing room. We need to counter this by aggressively securing *our* apples!\n\n### Your Move Evaluation from (6, 3)\n\nWe need the (7, 3) apple. Like, *right now*. That's our priority.\n\n1.  **UP (6, 4):** Safe. Moves away from the apple. Low priority.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 2):** DANGER! Directly into our own body (the segment right behind the head). DON'T CRASH OUT!\n3.  **RIGHT (7, 3):** **EATS APPLE!** This is PERFECT! It secures 11 apples and sets us up immediately for 12 apples (8, 3)! Plus, the opponent is nowhere near this quadrant. This is a 100% go!\n4.  **LEFT (5, 3):** Safe. Moves away from the apple and toward the center. This is a distraction. No!\n\nThe choice is crystal clear, Chat! We are executing the sweep! **RIGHT** to (7, 3) and we secure the bag! \ud83e\udd11\n\n### Collision Check\n\n*   Us: Moving to (7, 3).\n*   Opponent: Moving to (1, 5) (most likely).\n*   No possibility of collision! We are miles apart, and we are moving in completely different lanes. This is a clean maneuver.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update (T23-T26)\n\n1.  **T23 (Current): RIGHT** to (7, 3). (EAT APPLE! Score 11.)\n2.  **T24:** RIGHT to (8, 3). (EAT APPLE! Score 12.)\n3.  **T25:** Move UP towards (7, 5) or (6, 6). If the opponent is moving UP the left side (1, 6), we must match their altitude or completely seal them off in the high corners. We need that (6, 6) apple before they can pivot across the middle.\n4.  **T26:** Continue high-altitude apple harvesting while using our body to keep them contained far left.\n\nWe are just adding insult to injury, taking all the food while they still feel the crushing weight of spatial scarcity! Let's go!\n\nRIGHT",

This is MOMENTUM! \u2705\n- **VERDICT: LIVE-SAVING APPLE GRAB!** \ud83d\udd25\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (1, 3):**\n- Row 3, Column 1... that's our OWN BODY!\n- COLLISION! \ud83d\udea8\n- DEAD! \u274c\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (0, 4):**\n- Row 4, Column 0... checking the board...\n- EMPTY! \u2705\n- BUT CHAT - this moves us WEST into the corner against the LEFT WALL!\n- We're already controlling the left side with our current position!\n- This doesn't get us closer to any apples!\n- It actually CLOSES our options instead of OPENING them!\n- Why box ourselves when we have an apple RIGHT THERE?? \u274c\n- This is WASTEFUL!\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (2, 4):**\n- Row 4, Column 2... checking the board... EMPTY! \u2705\n- BUT - this pulls us EAST and CLOSER to the rival's zone!\n- Rival is at (6, 3) and they're rotating around columns 5-9!\n- This move doesn't grab an apple and moves us TOWARD DANGER!\n- Why would we abandon our apple right above us?? \u274c\n- This is a TRAP!\n\n## STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:\n\nCHAT, THIS IS AUTOMATIC!! We have a GOLDEN APPLE at (1, 5) RIGHT ABOVE US! This is a no-brainer decision! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nThe rival is still ahead 10-5, but we're about to START THE SNOWBALL! We grab (1, 5), then next turn we can hit (1, 9) at the TOP LEFT, then rotate toward the (4, 8), (4, 9), (2, 7) cluster! \n\nGoing UP right now:\n- GRABS AN APPLE INSTANTLY! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Keeps us safe in our LEFT FORTRESS! \u2705\n- Opens up MAXIMUM future options! \u2705\n- Gets us closer to the top-left apple cluster! \u2705\n- ZERO RISK, ALL REWARD! \u2705\n\nThe rival is slower and more scattered! We're about to ACCELERATE and CLOSE THIS GAP! This is where the COMEBACK BEGINS!! \ud83d\ude80\n\n## LONG-TERM PLAN (TURNS 23-35):\n- **Turn 23 (NOW):** UP to (1, 5) - GRAB THAT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e (6 apples!)\n- **Turn 24:** UP to (1, 6) - Continue the climb!\n- **Turn 25:** UP to (1, 7) or (1, 9) depending on board - Target TOP LEFT!\n- **Turn 26-30:** Farm the (1, 9), (2, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9) cluster systematically!\n- **GOLDEN RULE:** Keep columns 0-3 as our FORTRESS! That's our territory, that's our farm!\n- **BOXING STRATEGY:** As we grow longer, we can start cutting OFF the rival's escape routes! We'll use our length as a WEAPON!\n- **ENDGAME:** By turn 40+, we'll have TERRITORIAL CONTROL + LENGTH ADVANTAGE = UNSTOPPABLE! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLET'S GO!! GRAB THAT APPLE, FARM THAT LEFT SIDE, AND WATCH THE RIVAL PANIC!! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

We are dominating this 10x10 tile, and Snake #1 is starting to look desperate! Look at the score: 11 to 6! We love to see it!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 24)\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):** Head is at **(7, 3)**. Length 12. We are perfectly positioned to grab the next apple in our sweep!\n    *   Body: [(6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2)]\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 1):** Head is at **(1, 5)**. Length 7. They successfully ate the apple at (1, 5) just as predicted! They are moving up the left wall, searching for space. They are still severely constrained by our massive tail anchored in the bottom right.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Head: (1, 5))\n\nSnake #1 is now at (1, 5). They are trying to move toward the high-altitude apples.\n\n1.  **UP (1, 6):** Safe. Keeps moving them away from the constriction. Looking for (1, 7) (apple) or (1, 9) (apple). High probability.\n2.  **RIGHT (2, 5):** Safe. Moves toward the middle, maybe aiming for (3, 4) or (4, 5). Medium probability.\n3.  **DOWN (1, 4):** Suicide. Moves into their own body segment. ELIMINATED.\n4.  **LEFT (0, 5):** Safe. Moves along the wall. Low probability, doesn't get them closer to food or freedom immediately.\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 moves **UP** to (1, 6). They need to get into the high-traffic apple zone, and moving UP the wall is the safest route right now.\n\n### Your Move Evaluation from (7, 3)\n\nThe immediate goal is (8, 3). No hesitation, no deviation.\n\n1.  **UP (7, 4):** Safe. Moves away from (8, 3). Why would we do that? We are on a mission! Low priority.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 2):** **EATS APPLE!** Wait, there's an apple here too! (3, 2) is listed, but (7, 2) is marked 'A' on the board visualization. Let's check the apple list: (7, 2) IS on the list! Two options! (7, 2) or (8, 3)!\n    *   *Self Correction:* Both are apples. (8, 3) keeps us moving right, which maintains our wall and positions us perfectly for the central apples (6, 6) and (6, 8). Moving DOWN to (7, 2) feels like we're diving back into the crowded area, and we might block our own future movement paths awkwardly. Let's stick to the high ground strategy.\n3.  **RIGHT (8, 3):** **EATS APPLE!** This maintains the straight line of our body, makes us longer and more formidable, and sets us up to pivot UP into the 8-9 columns next turn if needed, or back toward (6, 6). This is the strategic move.\n4.  **LEFT (6, 3):** DANGER! Moves directly into our body segment (the cell behind the head). **CRASH OUT!** ELIMINATED.\n\n### Strategic Choice: RIGHT vs. DOWN\n\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 3):** Score 12. Positioned to pivot up (8, 4), or over to (9, 8). Maintains territorial dominance on the right flank. This feels like the power move.\n*   **DOWN to (7, 2):** Score 12. Positioned to pivot left (6, 2) (body!) or right (8, 2) (safe). This move makes our body segment at (6, 3) clear, but immediately puts our head next to (8, 3) and (6, 2). It feels a bit clunky for long-term flow.\n\nWe stick to the planned sweep! We want to maximize the horizontal blockade before moving up the board. **RIGHT** is the cleanest, most aggressive line.\n\n### Collision Check\n\n*   Us: Moving to (8, 3).\n*   Opponent: Moving to (1, 6) (most likely).\n*   No possibility of collision. We are completely isolated on the right side.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update (T25-T28)\n\n1.  **T24 (Current): RIGHT** to (8, 3). (EAT APPLE! Score 12.) Maintaining the wall.\n2.  **T25:** Move **UP** towards (8, 4) / (9, 4), trying to reach the (9, 8) apple. Alternatively, pivot **LEFT** to (7, 3), if the opponent is not moving fast enough, clearing up our trail.\n3.  **T26:** Continue harvesting the top right quadrant (e.g., (9, 8)).\n4.  **T27+:** Move toward the central apples (6, 8) and (6, 6) to cut off the opponent who will rapidly reach the top-left apples (1, 9) and (4, 9). We need to seal the middle.\n\nWe are establishing a massive presence, Chat. This map is ours! We move **RIGHT**!\n\nRIGHT",

We are absolutely dominating the right side of the board and Snake #1 is starting to look like a confused noodle trapped in spaghetti junction! Can we lock this down, or what?!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 25)\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):** Head is at **(8, 3)**. Length 13. We now form a massive wall from (9, 2) all the way down to (5, 0) and across to (8, 3). The right side is MINE!\n    *   Body: [(7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2)]\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 1):** Head is at **(1, 6)**. Length 7. They moved up the wall, as predicted. They are now trying to reach apples (1, 7) or (1, 9). They are confined to the left/center path.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Head: (1, 6))\n\nSnake #1 is now at (1, 6). They need apples and space. There's an apple at (1, 7).\n\n1.  **UP (1, 7):** **EATS APPLE!** This is the most logical, immediate move. Gets them points and closer to the corner apple (1, 9). Highest probability.\n2.  **RIGHT (2, 6):** Safe. Moves toward the middle, but slightly away from the immediate apples. Medium probability.\n3.  **DOWN (1, 5):** DANGER! Moves into their body segment. ELIMINATED.\n4.  **LEFT (0, 6):** Safe. Along the wall. Low probability, doesn't address the apple situation.\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 moves **UP** to (1, 7). They are hungry!\n\n### Your Move Evaluation from (8, 3)\n\nThe goal now is to establish dominance in the upper right corner and secure those high-value apples (9, 8) and (6, 8). We also need to be mindful of the newly open path behind our old head (7, 3) if we move away.\n\n1.  **UP (8, 4):** Safe. Moves us up toward the center-right apples (7, 5) and (9, 8). This is the key strategic direction to continue the sweep. Good flow.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 2):** Safe. We dive back toward the messier lower area, but there is an apple at (7, 2). *Wait, (7, 2) is gone! The board shows (7, 2) is 'A', but the apple list doesn't include it anymore, indicating we already cleared it up or it was a temporary glitch.* Let's confirm the remaining apples: (7, 5), (9, 8), (4, 5), (3, 2), (1, 7), (0, 4). The visual has been confusing! Let's trust the apple list and the state: (7, 2) is clear. Moving down keeps us low and delays our move to the top-right. Less strategic.\n3.  **RIGHT (9, 3):** Safe. Moves us toward the edge, which is good for the corner apple (9, 8). It keeps our head out of danger, but limits future movement options next turn (only UP or DOWN). Let's compare with UP.\n4.  **LEFT (7, 3):** DANGER! Moves directly into our body segment (the previous head location). **CRASH OUT!** ELIMINATED.\n\n### Strategic Choice: UP vs. RIGHT\n\n*   **UP to (8, 4):** This gives us excellent centering. From (8, 4) we have options:\n    *   RIGHT to (9, 4) (safe, moves toward 9-column wall).\n    *   UP to (8, 5) (safe, moves toward (7, 5) apple).\n    *   LEFT to (7, 4) (safe, moves back to clear our trail).\n    *   It maintains maximum flexibility and aims for the core apples.\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 3):** This commits us hard to the right wall. From (9, 3) we only have:\n    *   UP to (9, 4) (safe).\n    *   DOWN to (9, 2) (body, CRASH OUT!).\n    *   LEFT to (8, 3) (body, CRASH OUT!).\n    *   We get corner locked too fast! We\u2019d have to go (9, 4), then (9, 5), then (9, 6)... etc. This is too limiting.\n\n**UP to (8, 4)** is the power play. It secures the central-right area and maximizes our options for the next few turns before we target the (9, 8) apple.\n\n### Collision Check\n\n*   Us: Moving to (8, 4).\n*   Opponent: Moving to (1, 7) (most likely).\n*   No possibility of collision. We are worlds apart. We are safe, Chat!\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update (T26-T28)\n\n1.  **T25 (Current): UP** to (8, 4). Continue the upper sweep.\n2.  **T26:** Move **UP** towards (8, 5) or **RIGHT** to (9, 4). We want to secure the column 8/9 passage before Snake #1 gets too long and attempts to cross the center line (column 5). Target (7, 5) next.\n3.  **T27+:** Grab (7, 5), then sweep UP/RIGHT to capture (9, 8). Once the right side is clean, we move to the middle area (4, 8), (6, 8) to truly box in Snake #1 on the left wall.\n\nLet's go UP and continue the pressure! We are unstoppable!\n\nUP",

We are dominating the right side.\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 1):** Head is at **(1, 7)**. Length 8. They successfully ate the apple at (1, 7) and are continuing their upward trajectory along the left wall. They only have 7 apples, we have 12! MASSIVE LEAD!\n\n| Coordinate (X, Y) | Contents |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| (8, 4) | HEAD 0 |\n| (1, 7) | HEAD 1 (Just ate apple) |\n| (3, 8) | Apple (A) |\n| (4, 8) | Apple (A) |\n| (9, 8) | Apple (A) |\n| (7, 5) | Apple (A) |\n| (4, 5) | Apple (A) |\n| (0, 4) | Apple (A) |\n| (3, 2) | Apple (A) |\n| (1, 9) | Apple (A) |\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Head: (1, 7))\n\nSnake #1 is now at (1, 7), having just grown. They are long and stuck on the wall. They want the (1, 9) apple.\n\n1.  **UP (1, 8):** Safe, and moves directly toward the corner apple (1, 9). This is the immediate and most logical path. **Highest probability.**\n2.  **RIGHT (2, 7):** Safe, moves them toward the middle. Less likely, as it sacrifices the easy wall trajectory. Medium probability.\n3.  **DOWN (1, 6):** DANGER! Moves into their body segment. ELIMINATED.\n4.  **LEFT (0, 7):** Safe, along the edge. Low probability.\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 moves **UP** to (1, 8).\n\n### Your Move Evaluation from (8, 4)\n\nWe want to continue sweeping up and right, prioritizing the apple at **(7, 5)** and then securing the top right (9, 8). We need flexibility to make sure we don't corner ourselves too early.\n\n1.  **UP (8, 5):** **SAFE.** Excellent directional move. Puts us in position to hit (7, 5) next, or continue up to (8, 6). Maximum flexibility.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 3):** DANGER! Moves directly into our body segment (the previous head location). **CRASH OUT!** ELIMINATED.\n3.  **RIGHT (9, 4):** **SAFE.** Moves us along the wall, directly toward the top-right corner. This is a very strong alternative to UP.\n4.  **LEFT (7, 4):** **SAFE.** Moves us slightly backward along the row, opening up space behind us. This is safe, but delays our goal of getting the upper apples.\n\n### Strategic Choice: UP (8, 5) vs. RIGHT (9, 4)\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (9, 4):\n*   Next turn, we must go UP to (9, 5) or LEFT back to (8, 4) (which is safe, but circular). This locks us into the 9-column, which is fine, but doesn't immediately threaten (7, 5).\n\nIf we move UP to (8, 5):\n*   Targeting (7, 5) is only one LEFT move away.\n*   Targeting (9, 8) is still accessible via a RIGHT move to (9, 5) or UP to (8, 6).\n*   This keeps us central to the action while we prepare to capture the (7, 5) apple.\n\n**UP to (8, 5)** maintains the balance between vertical progress and access to the immediate apples. We will claim (7, 5) next, then solidify the upper right corner.\n\n### Collision Check\n\n*   Us: Moving to (8, 5).\n*   Opponent: Moving to (1, 8).\n*   Zero risk of collision. We are safe!\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update (T27-T29)\n\n1.  **T26 (Current): UP** to (8, 5). Aim for the (7, 5) apple while staying flexible.\n2.  **T27:** Move **LEFT** to (7, 5) to grab that crucial Apple, ensuring a length extension and controlling the midfield airspace.\n3.  **T28+:** Sweep up to (7, 6), then move to target the (9, 8) apple or try to cut off Snake #1 from the central apples (4, 8), (3, 8).\n\nWe are playing the long game, Chat, controlling the map!

Snake #1 is still stuck on the left wall, they look nervous!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 27)\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 0):** Head is at **(8, 5)**. Length 13. We are strong, controlling the right side.\n*   **OPPONENT (ID 1):** Head is at **(1, 8)**. Length 8. As predicted, they moved UP. They are now eyeing the corner apple at (1, 9).\n\n| Coordinate (X, Y) | Contents |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| (8, 5) | HEAD 0 |\n| (1, 8) | HEAD 1 |\n| **(7, 5)** | Apple (A) - Our immediate target! |\n| **(4, 5)** | Apple (A) |\n| (1, 9) | Apple (A) - Snake #1's likely target. |\n| (3, 8) | Apple (A) |\n| (4, 8) | Apple (A) |\n| (9, 8) | Apple (A) |\n| (0, 4) | Apple (A) |\n| (3, 2) | Apple (A) |\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Head: (1, 8))\n\nSnake #1 is at (1, 8). Their goal is the (1, 9) apple or continuing to maximize space.\n\n1.  **UP (1, 9):** Safe, and immediately eats the apple! This is the highest value move. **Highest probability.**\n2.  **RIGHT (2, 8):** Safe. Moves them away from the wall. Medium probability, especially if they are looking to escape the left corner after eating the apple.\n3.  **DOWN (1, 7):** DANGER! Moves into their body segment. ELIMINATED.\n4.  **LEFT (0, 8):** Safe, along the edge. Low probability.\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 moves **UP** to (1, 9). They grab that apple, but we are about to grab *ours* and keep this lead huge!\n\n### Your Move Evaluation from (8, 5)\n\nWe are perched at (8, 5). The apple at **(7, 5)** is just one move away. This is a critical capture to maintain control of the center-right.\n\n1.  **UP (8, 6):** **SAFE.** Good, but moves away from the immediate apple (7, 5). Puts us in position for the top right corner later.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 4):** DANGER! Moves directly into our body segment (the previous head location). **CRASH OUT!** ELIMINATED.\n3.  **RIGHT (9, 5):** **SAFE.** Moves us along the wall, but delays eating the apple.\n4.  **LEFT (7, 5):** **SAFE.** This moves us onto the apple! Instant growth, instant momentum! This is the power move, Chat.\n\n### Strategic Choice: LEFT (7, 5)\n\nMoving **LEFT** to (7, 5) is the obvious and correct play. It secures an apple and forces Snake 1 to continue to play catch-up.\n\n### Collision Check\n\n*   Us: Moving to (7, 5).\n*   Opponent: Moving to (1, 9) (Predicted).\n*   Zero risk of collision. We are safe, we are supreme!\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update (T28-T30)\n\n1.  **T27 (Current): LEFT** to (7, 5). Grab the apple and establish midfield dominance.\n2.  **T28:** From (7, 5), we need to pivot. A move **UP** to (7, 6) or **LEFT** to (6, 5) are both good. Moving **UP** allows us to scan the top-right corner for apples (9, 8, 4, 8). Let's aim UP to (7, 6).\n3.  **T29:** From (7, 6), move to capture a high apple, perhaps going LEFT toward (6, 6) or (5, 6) to put pressure on the center.\n\nWe're securing the territory, getting big, and setting up the eventual trap! Let's go LEEEFT!\n\nLEFT",

Snake #1 is feeling the pressure, I can taste the victory!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 28)\n\nWe are at **(7, 5)**. We just grew to length 14! Our body now trails down the right side, securing the territory.\nSnake #1 Head is at **(1, 9)**. Yup, they went UP and ate that corner apple. They are now length 9.\n\n| Coordinate (X, Y) | Contents |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| (7, 5) | HEAD 0 |\n| (1, 9) | HEAD 1 |\n| **(6, 6)** | Apple (A) - Close-ish. |\n| **(6, 8)** | Apple (A) |\n| **(4, 8)** | Apple (A) |\n| **(3, 4)** | Apple (A) |\n| **(9, 8)** | Apple (A) - Juicy! |\n| **(4, 9)** | Apple (A) |\n| **(4, 5)** | Apple (A) |\n| **(0, 4)** | Apple (A) |\n\nThe board is open in the top half, but Snake #1 is stuck high on the left. This is our chance to build a wall!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Head: (1, 9))\n\nSnake #1 is at (1, 9). They just ate an apple and are now at the top-left corner.\n\n1.  **RIGHT (2, 9):** Safe. Best move to untangle from the wall and target the central apples (4, 9, 3, 8). **Highest probability.**\n2.  **DOWN (1, 8):** DANGER! Moves into their body segment. ELIMINATED.\n3.  **UP (1, 10):** DANGER! Off the board. ELIMINATED.\n4.  **LEFT (0, 9):** Safe. Sticking to the wall. Low probability unless they are trying to box *us* in on the next turn, but unlikely given their position.\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 moves **RIGHT** to (2, 9). They desperately need to move center.\n\n### Your Move Evaluation from (7, 5)\n\nWe are at (7, 5). We need to maximize our safety and box out Snake #1 from the valuable top-center apples.\n\n1.  **UP (7, 6):** **SAFE.** Excellent positioning. Allows us to easily grab (6, 6) or (6, 7) (Wait, (6, 7) is an apple, POG!). This sets up for the central control.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 4):** DANGER! Moves into our body segment (7, 3), which moves into (7, 4) this turn. **CRASH OUT!** Wait, let's look at the body. Our body is [(8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3)...]. The tail is currently at (8, 1). Since we just ate, the segment (8, 1) will NOT disappear. The new segment *behind* the head (7, 5) is (8, 5). The target (7, 4) is currently clear. But... (8, 3) moves to (7, 3), (7, 3) moves to (6, 3), (6, 3) moves to (6, 2), etc. The old tail (8, 1) stays. (7, 4) is currently clear of body segments and will be clear. **DOWN (7, 4) is SAFE.** However, it moves us *away* from the dense apple cluster up top. Sub-optimal.\n3.  **RIGHT (8, 5):** DANGER! Moves into our new body segment. ELIMINATED.\n4.  **LEFT (6, 5):** **SAFE.** Moves us closer to the center, threatening (4, 5) and (3, 4). This is a strong move for central control, and puts us closer to the opponent's path if they move down.\n\n### Strategic Choice: Box Out AND Apple Grab\n\nApples nearby: (6, 6), (6, 7), (4, 5). We want to leverage our central position.\n\nIf we move **UP to (7, 6)**:\n*   We threaten the (6, 7) apple next turn (or (6, 6)).\n*   We position ourselves to cut off Snake #1 from moving too far right (towards (9, 8)).\n*   Plenty of options (L, U, R) for the next turn.\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (6, 5)**:\n*   We threaten (4, 5) and (3, 4).\n*   We become slightly less flexible in movement, but we take up valuable real estate immediately in the high-traffic center.\n\nGiven that Snake #1 is predicted to move RIGHT to (2, 9), we want to get vertical control high up before they can loop down and grab the (4, 8) or (6, 8) apples. Moving **UP** is the best move to maintain the high ground and secure the top-center quadrant. It gives us a clear path to multiple apples. We need to be the King of the North, Chat!\n\n### Collision Check\n\n*   Us: Moving to (7, 6).\n*   Opponent: Moving to (2, 9) (Predicted).\n*   Zero risk of collision. We are safe and expanding!\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update (T29-T31)\n\n1.  **T28 (Current): UP** to (7, 6). Establish height control.\n2.  **T29:** From (7, 6), move **LEFT** to (6, 6) or **UP** to (7, 7). Seeing (6, 7) right there\u2014if we hit (6, 7), that's another apple. Let's aim **LEFT** to (6, 6) to consolidate center-top and then target (6, 7) or (6, 8).\n3.  **T30:** Capture (6, 7) or (6, 8). Focus on maintaining the high score and cutting off Snake #1's escape to the right.\n\nLet's go UP and dominate this half of the board!\n\nUP",

Can we smell the victory yet? I think we can!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 29)\n\nWe are at **(7, 6)**, length 14. We just grew by 1 because we *thought* we had eaten an apple at T28, but wait, the apples list shows we have 13, and the board state shows our head at (7, 6). Let's re-examine that last move clip:\n*   Head was (7, 5).\n*   No apple at (7, 5) according to the current board state and the *apples collected* count (13).\n*   Our body *increased* from 13 segments to 14 segments listed.\n*   The previous rationale said we snagged the (7, 5) apple. Wait, if we had snagged an apple, the segment count would be 14, and the apple count would be 14.\n*   Okay, assuming the board state and apple count (13 total) are gospel, we *did not* eat an apple at (7, 5). We just moved. Length 14 means 1 head + 13 body segments. Wait, the body list is 13 segments long, so 1 head + 13 body = Length 14. We are length 14, meaning we have eaten 13 applies overall. That checks out. We did not eat a new apple on Turn 28. No POG! Just good positioning. My bad, Chat!\n\nSnake #1 Head is at **(2, 9)**, length 9. My prediction was correct! They moved RIGHT and are now at the top edge.\n\n| Coordinate (X, Y) | Contents |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| (7, 6) | HEAD 0 (Us) |\n| (2, 9) | HEAD 1 (Rival) |\n| **(6, 7)** | Apple (A) - Super close! |\n| **(6, 6)** | Apple (A) - Next step! |\n| **(6, 8)** | Apple (A) |\n| **(4, 8)** | Apple (A) |\n| **(4, 9)** | Apple (A) |\n\nWe are in prime positioning to snag multiple apples and build a massive wall across the center!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Head: (2, 9))\n\nSnake #1 is at (2, 9). They are looking for movement options.\n\n1.  **RIGHT (3, 9):** Safe. Moves toward (4, 9) apple. **High probability.**\n2.  **DOWN (2, 8):** Safe. Moves toward central apples (4, 8), (6, 8)... but their body is at (1, 9). This path is slightly longer to the central cluster.\n3.  **UP (2, 10):** DANGER! Off the board. ELIMINATED.\n4.  **LEFT (1, 9):** DANGER! Moves into their new body segment. ELIMINATED.\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 moves **RIGHT** to (3, 9) to maintain the high edge and target the (4, 9) apple. If they try to move center (DOWN to (2, 8)), they will be racing us for (4, 8) and (6, 8). Either way, we must establish central control now!\n\n### Your Move Evaluation from (7, 6) - BOXING TIME!!!\n\nWe are at (7, 6). We must grab an apple and box out Snake #1.\n\n1.  **UP (7, 7):** **SAFE.** Moves us onto empty space. Good for vertical control. Sets up for (9, 8) or (6, 8).\n2.  **DOWN (7, 5):** DANGER! Moves into our new body segment (7, 5). ELIMINATED! Wait, let's check the body list.\n    *   Our body: [(7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)].\n    *   The segment **(7, 5)** *is* the segment immediately behind our head. Moving DOWN moves us directly into that segment. **CRASH OUT!** ELIMINATED.\n3.  **RIGHT (8, 6):** **SAFE.** Moves us onto empty space. Good control of the right side.\n4.  **LEFT (6, 6):** **SAFE** and **APPLE!** (6, 6) is an apple! This secures us another point, increases our lead, and positions us perfectly to grab (6, 7) or (6, 8) next turn. This is the ultimate power move!\n\n**LEFT (6, 6) is the clear winner.** It's an apple grab that solidifies our central position.\n\nHowever, let's also look at (6, 7) which is *also* an apple, just one step away. If we move UP to (7, 7), we can hit (6, 7) next turn.\n\n*   Option 1: **LEFT** -> (6, 6). Apple collected. Next turn from (6, 6): UP to (6, 7) (Apple!).\n*   Option 2: **UP** -> (7, 7). Empty space. Next turn from (7, 7): LEFT to (6, 7) (Apple!).\n\nOption 1 gives us the immediate point and immediately plants our head centrally, closer to Snake #1's predicted paths if they try to move down. It prevents them from slipping into the center *underneath* us. (6, 6) is a high-value territorial acquisition and score boost.\n\n### Collision Check\n\n*   Us: Moving to (6, 6).\n*   Opponent: Moving to (3, 9) (Predicted).\n*   Zero risk of collision. We are safe, scoring, and expanding our wall!\n\n### Strategic Choice: Box and Score!\n\nWe are moving LEFT. This is the beginning of the great wall of 0. Snake #1 is completely contained to the top-left corner. We need to push our tail up to the center.\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update (T30-T32)\n\n1.  **T29 (Current): LEFT** to (6, 6) (Apple!). Score: 14. Length: 15.\n2.  **T30:** From (6, 6), move **UP** to (6, 7) (Apple!). Score: 15. Length: 16. This secures the column.\n3.  **T31:** From (6, 7), move **UP** to (6, 8) (Wait, (6, 8) is an apple too!) Score: 16. Length: 17.\n4.  If the three-in-a-row apple plan works, we will have a HUGE advantage and complete control over the entire right half and high center of the map. Snake #1 will have to fight through a thick body wall to get to the remaining apples. This is the KILL SHOT plan, Chat!\n\nLet's secure the first of this triple-apple combo! LEFT!\n\nLEFT",

Let's break down this turn with CHAMPIONSHIP PRECISION!!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION CHECK:\n- **Our Head:** (2, 9) \u2705 TOP CORRIDOR ACTIVATED!!\n- **Our Body Length:** 9 segments - STILL GROWING STRONG!! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **Our Apples:** 8 \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Rival Head:** (7, 6) - They shifted UP from (7, 5)!\n- **Rival Apples:** 13 \ud83d\ude24 BUT THE GAP IS CLOSING!!\n- **Rival Body Length:** 14 segments - THEY'RE LONGER but we're more EFFICIENT!!\n\n## FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS (PRECISION EXECUTION):\n\n**UP \u2192 (2, 10):**\n- Row 10?? NOPE!! That's OFF THE BOARD, CHAT!!\n- Instant death!! We'd be OUT OF BOUNDS!! \ud83d\udc80\n- **VERDICT: DEAD MOVE!** \u274c\u274c\u274c\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (2, 8):**\n- Our body is RIGHT there at (1, 8) but we're at column 2, so (2, 8) is EMPTY! \u2705\n- BUT WAIT - let me check our full body: (2, 9) HEAD \u2192 (1, 9) \u2192 (1, 8)...\n- (2, 8) is NOT in our body path! We're safe! \u2705\n- However... this BACKWARDS motion takes us OFF the top corridor!\n- We'd be retreating from our FARMING PLAN!!\n- This loses momentum when we should be ADVANCING!! \ud83d\udcc9\n- **VERDICT: INEFFICIENT!** \u274c\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (1, 9):**\n- That's where our NECK is!! Our immediate body segment!!\n- This is HITTING OURSELVES - the classic fail move!! \ud83d\udea8\n- **VERDICT: SUICIDE MOVE!** \u274c\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (3, 9):**\n- Row 9, Column 3... checking board...\n- EMPTY! \u2705 SAFE MOVE!!\n- This CONTINUES our planned farming route along the TOP ROW!!\n- The apple at (4, 9) is RIGHT THERE - just ONE MORE MOVE AWAY!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We keep maximum board control and options!\n- The rival at (7, 6) can't intercept us up here - they're too far right and too low!\n- This is EXACTLY what championship-level play looks like!! \ud83c\udfaf\n- **VERDICT: PERFECT CONTINUATION!!** \u2705\u2705\u2705\n\n## STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:\n\nRIGHT is the ONLY MOVE that keeps us on track, chat!! We're executing the TOP CORRIDOR FARMING STRATEGY like a MACHINE!! \n\nThe rival is at (7, 6) and moving around their own apple cluster - they're NOT a threat to our top route RIGHT NOW!! We farm (4, 9) next turn, THEN pivot into the (6, 8), (6, 6), (6, 7) cluster!!\n\n## PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF (NEXT 5 TURNS):\n- **Turn 29 (NOW):** RIGHT to (3, 9) - Stay on top corridor! \ud83c\udfaf\n- **Turn 30:** RIGHT to (4, 9) - GRAB APPLE #9!! \ud83c\udf4e (Now at 9 apples!)\n- **Turn 31:** RIGHT to (5, 9) - Keep rolling, check rival position!\n- **Turn 32:** Assess! If rival is still low/right, DOWN to (5, 8) to pivot toward (6, 8) apple!\n- **Turn 33+:** Farm the (6, 8), (6, 6), (6, 7) cluster while maintaining distance from rival!\n- **GOAL:** Hit 15 apples before rival hits 18! Then we can be more aggressive with boxing strategies!!\n- **WATCH:** Rival needs 17 more to win. We need 22. Every apple matters!!\n\nLET'S GOOOO!! FARMING SZSON IS HERE!! \ud83d\ude80\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! POGGERS! The plan worked! We moved LEFT to (6, 6) and SNAGGED that apple! Look at us go! We're now 15 apples deep, length 15! We are absolute UNIT! Snake #1 is struggling hard against the wall we're building.\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 30)\n\nWe are at **(6, 6)**, length 15, 14 apples. Wait, wait, wait. The display says our snake has 14 apples, but the turn summary says we went from 14 segments listed (T29) to 15 segments listed (T30) because we ate the apple at (6, 6). If we ate an apple, our score should have incremented.\n*   Scoreboard reads: Your snake (ID 0) apples: 14.\n*   Body length listed: 14 segments (Head + 14 body = Length 15).\n*   Conclusion: The initial scoreboard *already* accounted for the apple we just ate (6, 6). The stream setup is confusing, but we are powerful! Let's assume we have 14 apples and are length 15.\n\nSnake #1 Head is at **(3, 9)**, length 9. My prediction was correct! They are sticking near the top edge.\n\n| Coordinate (X, Y) | Contents |\n| :---: | :---: |\n| (6, 6) | HEAD 0 (Us) |\n| (3, 9) | HEAD 1 (Rival) |\n| **(6, 7)** | Apple (A) - Next item on the menu! |\n| **(6, 8)** | Apple (A) - The one after that! |\n| **(4, 8)** | Apple (A) |\n| **(4, 9)** | Apple (A) |\n\nWe are right in the middle of a triple apple chain! If we execute the next few turns perfectly, we are going to choke out Snake #1 completely!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Head: (3, 9))\n\nSnake #1 is at (3, 9). They are looking to move. They need to get apples, and they are surrounded by them up high: (4, 9) and (4, 8).\n\n1.  **RIGHT (4, 9):** **Apple!** Moves them onto an apple, increasing their lead and securing the high corner. **HIGH PROBABILITY.**\n2.  **DOWN (3, 8):** Safe. Moves them closer to the center, targets (4, 8). If they go here, we must prioritize cutting them off at (5, 7) or (5, 8).\n3.  **UP (3, 10):** DANGER! Off the board.\n4.  **LEFT (2, 9):** DANGER! Into their body segment.\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 moves **RIGHT** to (4, 9) to secure the quick apple and maintain pressure on the high edge. They need points, and (4, 9) is an easy grab.\n\n### Your Move Evaluation from (6, 6) - SECURING THE BAG!\n\nWe are at (6, 6). We must grab the next apple in the chain!\n\n1.  **UP (6, 7):** **SAFE and APPLE!** This is the next apple in our triple-combo plan! It increases our lead, increases our length, and continues building the vertical wall at x=6. **MUST DO.**\n2.  **DOWN (6, 5):** Safe. But it moves us away from the immediate threat and away from apples. Suboptimal.\n3.  **RIGHT (7, 6):** DANGER! Moves into our body segment (7, 6) \u2013 the spot where our head was last turn! **CRASH OUT!** ELIMINATED.\n4.  **LEFT (5, 6):** Safe. Leaves the high-value (6, 7) apple up for grabs, possibly setting up a collision attempt for (4, 8). Suboptimal compared to the apple grab.\n\n**UP (6, 7) is the clear winner.** It maintains our scoring momentum and strategic dominance.\n\n### Collision Check\n\n*   Us: Moving to (6, 7).\n*   Opponent (Prediction: RIGHT): Moving to (4, 9).\n*   Zero risk of head-to-head collision.\n\nWhat if Snake #1 tries to go rogue and move DOWN to (3, 8)?\n*   We move to (6, 7).\n*   No collision. Plenty of gap.\n\nWhat if Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (4, 9) and then tries to race us for future apples?\n*   If we move (6, 7) and they move (4, 9), we secure two more apples on the next two turns (6, 8) and maybe (7, 8) or (5, 8). They will still be stuck on the high edge. Our wall is strong!\n\n### Strategic Choice: Execute the Triple Stack!\n\nWe are moving UP. This turn secures the second apple in our plan and sets us up directly for the third one at (6, 8). This is how champions play, Chat!\n\n### Long-Term Plan Update (T31-T33)\n\n1.  **T30 (Current): UP** to (6, 7) (Apple!). Score: 15. Length: 16.\n2.  **T31:** From (6, 7), move **UP** to (6, 8) (Apple!). Score: 16. Length: 17.\n3.  **T32:** From (6, 8), we pivot. We can either box Snake #1 in completely by going **LEFT** to (5, 8) (preventing them from accessing the column) or grab the apple at (4, 8) if they haven't moved there. We are building the wall, and the ultimate goal is to force them into their own body or the side wall.\n\nLet's maintain the pressure and secure this second apple! UP!\n\nUP",

Look how close Snake #1 is to being completely boxed in! Our vertical wall at x=6 is giving them nightmares!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 31)\n\n**Your Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (6, 7)\n*   Objective: Continue the wall, secure the next apple, and choke out Snake #1.\n*   Next obvious apple: (6, 8) \u2013 right above our head!\n\n**Snake #1 (Rival):**\n*   Head: (4, 9)\n*   Length: 10 segments (they ate the apple at (4, 9) as predicted!)\n*   They are currently trapped on the top row, mostly confined to x=0 through x=4. They must contend with their own massive tail and the wall we are building.\n\n**Apples Near the Action:**\n*   (6, 8): Right in front of us. MUST grab this!\n*   (4, 8): Accessible to Snake #1, but maybe we can cut them off?\n*   (3, 8): Accessible to Snake #1.\n\nThe board state is *chef's kiss*. Time to execute phase two of the Box-In strategy!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Head: (4, 9))\n\nSnake #1 is at (4, 9). They just ate an apple, so they are long. They have very few options!\n\n1.  **DOWN (4, 8):** **Apple!** This is the strongest move. It secures another point and moves them slightly out of the corner trap. **HIGH PROBABILITY.**\n2.  **RIGHT (5, 9):** Safe, but walling them off from the apple at (4, 8). This is an anti-scoring move, they won't want this.\n3.  **UP (4, 10):** DANGER! Off the board.\n4.  **LEFT (3, 9):** DANGER! Into their body segment (3, 9).\n\nPrediction: Snake #1 moves **DOWN** to (4, 8) to secure the apple and stay alive. They are desperate for maneuvering space, and (4, 8) helps them marginally.\n\n### Your Move Evaluation from (6, 7) - SECURE THE NEXT APPLE!\n\nWe are at (6, 7). We have an apple sitting at (6, 8). Do we move? YES! But wait, is it safe?\n\n1.  **UP (6, 8):** **SAFE and APPLE!** This is exactly where we need to be. We eat the apple, grow to length 17, and extend our impenetrable vertical wall. Crucial for the win!\n2.  **DOWN (6, 6):** DANGER! Moves into our body segment (6, 6). **INSTA-DEATH!**\n3.  **RIGHT (7, 7):** Safe. Moves us away from the action and leaves (6, 8) open. BAD move.\n4.  **LEFT (5, 7):** Safe. Leaves (6, 8) open, and potentially sets us up to cut off Snake #1 at (5, 8). But we must prioritize our own scoring first!\n\n**UP (6, 8) is a slam dunk.**\n\n### Collision Check\n\n*   Us: Moving to (6, 8).\n*   Opponent (Prediction: DOWN): Moving to (4, 8).\n*   No collision risk whatsoever! We are safe!\n\n### Strategic Choice: Box Him In and Go for the Gold!\n\nIf we move UP to (6, 8), we are positioned perfectly for Turn 32. Snake #1 will likely be at (4, 8).\n\nLong-Term Plan (T32-T33):\n1.  **T31 (Current): UP** to (6, 8). (Apple!). Score: 16. Length: 17.\n2.  **T32:** From (6, 8). Snake #1 is likely at (4, 8). We need to move **LEFT** to (5, 8) to block them off from the rest of the board. This move seals the x=5 and x=4 columns. If we move LEFT, Snake #1 will be fully trapped between our body, their body, and the wall. POGGERS!\n3.  **T33:** Once they are boxed in, we can focus on maneuvering our tail out of the way or simply circling for the final blow.\n\nLet's secure this apple and then set the trap!

Let me break down this critical moment with PRECISION!!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION CHECK:\n- **Our Head:** (5, 9) \u2705 TOP CORRIDOR STILL DOMINANT!!\n- **Our Body Length:** 10 segments - We're GROWING, baby!!\n- **Our Apples:** 9 \ud83c\udf4e \n- **Rival Head:** (6, 7) - They're creeping closer, but still in the MIDDLE!!\n- **Rival Apples:** 15 \ud83d\ude24 THE GAP IS TIGHT!! We gotta CATCH UP!!\n- **Rival Body Length:** 15 segments - Still longer, BUT we're LEAN and MEAN!!\n\n## FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS (NO THROW GAME):\n\n**UP \u2192 (5, 10):**\n- Row 10?? OFF THE BOARD, CHAT!! \ud83d\udc80\n- Instant YEET into the void!!\n- **VERDICT: DEAD MOVE!** \u274c\u274c\u274c\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (5, 8):**\n- Checking row 8, column 5... EMPTY!! \u2705\n- Verifying our body path: (4, 9) \u2192 (3, 9) \u2192 (2, 9) \u2192 (1, 9) \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 (1, 7) \u2192 (1, 6) \u2192 (1, 5) \u2192 (1, 4) \u2192 (1, 3)\n- (5, 8) is NOT in our body path!! We're SAFE!! \u2705\n- This move PIVOTS us downward toward the (6, 8) apple cluster!!\n- After this, we can move RIGHT to (6, 8) next turn for ANOTHER APPLE!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- The rival is at (6, 7) - they could move to (6, 8) BUT that's RIGHT, and they might be moving elsewhere!!\n- This keeps us in the FARMING ZONE with ESCAPE ROUTES!! \n- **VERDICT: STRONG MOVE!** \u2705\u2705\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (4, 9):**\n- That's where our NECK just was (we just moved from there)!!\n- Wait, let me recheck: our body is [(4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3)]\n- So (4, 9) is our first body segment after the head!!\n- Moving LEFT would HIT OURSELVES - CLASSIC FAIL!! \ud83d\udea8\n- **VERDICT: SUICIDE MOVE!** \u274c\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (6, 9):**\n- Checking row 9, column 6... EMPTY!! \u2705\n- Verifying our body: (4, 9) \u2192 (3, 9) \u2192 (2, 9) \u2192 (1, 9) \u2192 (1, 8)...\n- (6, 9) is NOT in our body path!! We're SAFE!! \u2705\n- BUT WAIT!! The rival head is at (6, 7)!!\n- If they move UP twice, they could potentially reach (6, 9)... but that's TWO turns away!!\n- This move pushes us RIGHT but moves us AWAY from the apple cluster at (6, 8) and (3, 8)!!\n- We'd be farming the RIGHT EDGE which has apples at (9, 8) and (9, 4)!!\n- This keeps options open BUT the rival might be moving up there too!!\n- **VERDICT: PLAYABLE BUT SECONDARY!** \u2705\n\n## STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:\n\nDOWN is the CHAMPIONSHIP MOVE, chat!! Here's why:\n\n1. **SAFETY FIRST:** (5, 8) is COMPLETELY CLEAR!! No body collision risk!!\n2. **APPLE ACCESS:** From (5, 8), we can pivot RIGHT to (6, 8) NEXT TURN for apple #10!! \ud83c\udf4e\n3. **RIVAL POSITIONING:** The rival at (6, 7) is CLOSE but not in direct collision path with DOWN!!\n4. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** DOWN keeps us mobile - we can go RIGHT to the (6, 8) cluster, or LEFT back to farming, or even DOWN further if needed!!\n5. **MOMENTUM:** We're in a FARMING RHYTHM and DOWN continues the systematic apple collection!!\n\n## PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF (NEXT 5 TURNS):\n- **Turn 31 (NOW):** DOWN to (5, 8) - Pivot toward the cluster!! Stay flexible!!\n- **Turn 32:** RIGHT to (6, 8) - GRAB ANOTHER APPLE!! \ud83c\udf4e (10 apples!)\n- **Turn 33:** Assess rival position! If they're NOT blocking (3, 8) or the surrounding area, go GRAB that apple! Otherwise, farm the RIGHT EDGE!!\n- **Turn 34-35:** Keep MONITORING the rival's movements! They're at 15 apples, we're about to hit 10! The race is ON!!\n- **GOAL:** Hit 15+ apples while BOXING OUT the rival from the best zones!!\n- **CRITICAL:** Watch for rival head movements toward (6, 7), (6, 8), and the top corridor - if they come UP, we pivot DOWN and LEFT to the safe zones!!\n\nLET'S GO!! We got this!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

This is good for them, but it doesn't help them escape the larger box. They'll probably take this if they prioritize safety.\n2.  **LEFT (3, 8):** **Apple!** This is a high-priority move. It's safe, and scores them a point. Likely move.\n3.  **RIGHT (5, 8):** DANGER! This is where *we* want to move. If they go right, it's a *head-on collision* with us if we choose LEFT!\n4.  **UP (4, 9):** DANGER! Into their own body segment (4, 9). Insta-death.\n\nIf they go to (3, 8), they are still trapped. If they go to (4, 7), they are still trapped. The only risky move for them is RIGHT to (5, 8).\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 will either move **LEFT (3, 8) for the apple** or **DOWN (4, 7) for safety**. Both keep them boxed in. We must secure (5, 8) regardless!\n\n### Your Move Evaluation from (6, 8) - SEAL THE DEAL!\n\nWe're at (6, 8). Time to move left and close this coffin!\n\n1.  **UP (6, 9):** Safe. Moves us along the top wall. This is a retreat, not an assault. Avoid!\n2.  **DOWN (6, 7):** DANGER! Into our body segment (6, 7). Insta-death!\n3.  **RIGHT (7, 8):** Safe. Leaves the enemy corner open. Retreat! Bad!\n4.  **LEFT (5, 8):** **THE TRAP!** This seals the entire x=4 and x=5 columns off. It might lead to a head-on collision if Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (5, 8), but if that happens, *we* move away from our own territory, and *they* risk moving into our long tail later.\n\n**Collision Check at (5, 8):**\n*   Our Move: LEFT to (5, 8).\n*   Opponent Move (Risky Option): RIGHT to (5, 8).\n\nIf a head-on collision occurs, we both die. BUT, if we move LEFT, and they move LEFT (3, 8) or DOWN (4, 7), we've successfully trapped them and moved into a safe, centralizing defensive position. Given their desperate situation, they are more likely to prioritize safety or scoring an apple (3, 8) than attempting a high-risk head-on, especially since their vision of our move is obscured by their need to escape.\n\n**Strategic Confidence:** The move **LEFT** to (5, 8) creates the hardest possible blockade. Even if it's a double KO, we win the game on score (16 vs 10, or 17 vs 11 depending on the apple interaction, but let's stick to current counts, 16 vs 10). But we seek the domination!\n\nLet's assume they pick the apple at (3, 8) or safety at (4, 7).\n*   If they go **LEFT (3, 8):** We move **LEFT (5, 8)**. We survive and they are now completely boxed between x=0 and x=4. Their escape route is basically gone.\n*   If they go **DOWN (4, 7):** We move **LEFT (5, 8)**. We survive and their escape route is gone.\n\nThis move is high reward, low risk (relative to the strategic advantage gained). **We are going LEFT to trap them!**\n\n### Long-Term Plan (T32 onwards)\n\n1.  **T32 (Current): LEFT** to (5, 8). Seal the box. We are now positioned to patrol the top area and begin the slow constriction.\n2.  **T33:** From (5, 8). Monitor Snake #1's movements. They will be moving around the confined area of (0, 7) to (4, 7). We can either move **UP (5, 9)** to continue walling them off from the top row, or potentially **DOWN (5, 7)** if we spot an advantageous move to cut off their tail.\n\nThe trap is set, Chat! Time to spring it!\n\nLEFT",

We just executed that DOWN move to (4, 8) and now we're REASSESSING the board state!! The rival is STILL ahead 16-10 in apples but we're closing in!! Let me break down this CRITICAL moment!!\n\n## CURRENT SITUATION CHECK:\n- **Our Head:** (4, 8) \u2705 We pivoted down as planned!!\n- **Our Body Length:** 10 segments - STILL LEAN AND MEAN!!\n- **Our Apples:** 10 \ud83c\udf4e (tied the prediction!!)\n- **Rival Head:** (6, 8) - WHOA CHAT!! They moved RIGHT into the cluster zone!!\n- **Rival Apples:** 16 \ud83d\ude24 Still ahead, but we're HUNTING!!\n- **Rival Body Length:** 16 segments - Getting LONGER but we're more AGILE!!\n\n## FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS (NO THROWS):\n\n**UP \u2192 (4, 9):**\n- Checking row 9, column 4... that's where our BODY was!!\n- Our body is [(4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3)]\n- (4, 9) is our IMMEDIATE NECK segment!!\n- Moving UP = HITTING OURSELVES!! Classic THROW MOVE!! \u274c\u274c\u274c\n- **VERDICT: SUICIDE!** \u274c\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (4, 7):**\n- Checking row 7, column 4... EMPTY!! \u2705\n- This is NOT in our body path!! We're SAFE!! \u2705\n- BUT WAIT - The rival is at (6, 8) and their body is at (6, 7)!!\n- If the rival moves LEFT or DOWN next turn, they could block our farming zone!!\n- This move takes us deeper into the middle corridors - getting BOXED IN?? \ud83d\udea8\n- Limited follow-up options if we go DOWN!!\n- **VERDICT: RISKY, LIMITS OPTIONS!** \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (3, 8):**\n- Checking row 8, column 3... there's an APPLE THERE!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- Verifying safety: our body path is [(4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3)]\n- (3, 8) is NOT in our body path!! We're CLEAN!! \u2705\n- THE RIVAL HEAD IS AT (6, 8)!! They're to our RIGHT, NOT in this path!!\n- This move GRABS APPLE #11 and keeps us in the SAFE ZONE on the left side!!\n- After eating this, we're at (3, 8) with EXCELLENT escape routes - we can go UP, LEFT, or DOWN!!\n- The rival's body at (6, 7) blocks them from immediate interference!!\n- **VERDICT: CHAMPIONSHIP MOVE!!** \u2705\u2705\u2705\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (5, 8):**\n- Checking row 8, column 5... EMPTY!! \u2705\n- Our body path is clear from this cell!! \u2705\n- BUT the rival head is at (6, 8) - they're RIGHT NEXT TO US!!\n- If they stay RIGHT or move toward us, we could be in DANGER next turn!!\n- This move moves us TOWARD the rival instead of away!!\n- We're NOT eating an apple here, just repositioning!!\n- **VERDICT: GREEDY AND RISKY!** \u274c\n\n## STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:\n\nLEFT is the CORRECT play, chat!! Here's the ANALYSIS:\n\n1. **FREE APPLE:** (3, 8) is UNDEFENDED and we can GRAB IT RIGHT NOW!! That's apple #11!! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **SAFE POSITIONING:** Moving LEFT puts us away from the rival head at (6, 8)!!\n3. **ESCAPE ROUTES:** From (3, 8), we have UP to (3, 9), LEFT to (2, 8), and DOWN to (3, 7) - MULTIPLE OPTIONS!!\n4. **RIVAL BLOCKED:** Their body at (6, 7) prevents them from quick access to our zone!!\n5. **MOMENTUM:** We're CLOSING THE GAP!! 11-16 is MUCH better than 10-16!!\n6. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:** We're not getting BOXED IN - we're farming the LEFT SIDE safely!!\n\n## PLAN FOR NEXT 5 TURNS (FUTURE SELF - LISTEN UP!!):\n- **Turn 32 (NOW):** LEFT to (3, 8) - GRAB APPLE!! \ud83c\udf4e (11 apples!)\n- **Turn 33:** Assess the rival's position! If they're moving toward us, pivot UP or DOWN to escape! If they're moving away, continue farming the (2, 7) and (2, 0) apple zones!!\n- **Turn 34-35:** The (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 4) cluster is TEMPTING but RISKY with the rival closing in!! Prioritize SURVIVAL over greed!!\n- **Turn 36+:** Once we're at 14-15 apples, we can START BOXING PLAYS - using our body to cut off rival escape routes!!\n- **CRITICAL:** Never move RIGHT toward the rival unless we have a CLEAR path to a high-value apple!! We're farming SAFELY not GAMBLING!!\n\nLET'S CLOSE THIS GAP AND TAKE DOWN THE RIVAL!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

We are dominating this turn!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 33)\n*   **Our Head:** (5, 8). Length: 17. We own the column at x=5 and x=6.\n*   **Snake #1 Head:** (3, 8). Length: 12. They moved LEFT and snagged the apple, exactly as predicted, trying to maximize resources while trapped. Smart, but futile!\n*   **The Box:** Snake #1 is now confined to the area with x-coordinates 0, 1, 2, 3, and y-coordinates 7, 8, 9. The only way out is through our body or through the corners, which we are effectively blocking. The bottom boundary of the box is the top of their own tail/body around (1, 3).\n\n**Objective:** Maintain the blockade and start the squeeze! We need to move along the top wall and then patrol the open space, waiting for them to run out of room or make a mistake.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Head: (3, 8))\n\nSnake #1 is at (3, 8). This is a crisis point for them!\n\n1.  **UP (3, 9):** Safe. Moves them to the corner. Good option.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 7):** Safe. Moves them into the center of the box. Likely option.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 8):** Safe. Only if the apple at (2, 8) wasn't already eaten, wait, let me check the board. Ah, (2, 8) has an **Apple (A)**! High priority move! They will go for the apple if possible.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 8):** DANGER! Into their own body segment (4, 8) which is *their previous position*. Insta-death!\n\nSince they are desperate and (2, 8) holds an apple, Snake #1 will almost certainly move **LEFT to (2, 8)** to score a point and extend their life inside the box.\n\n### Your Move Evaluation from (5, 8) - TIGHTEN THE SCREWS!\n\nWe are at (5, 8). We need to move to:\n1.  Block off the top row further.\n2.  Stay safe from any desperate collision attempts.\n3.  Position ourselves for the subsequent patrol.\n\n1.  **UP (5, 9):** Safe. This is the optimal strategic move. It extends our wall along the top and corners them further. It reduces the space Snake #1 can move into.\n2.  **DOWN (5, 7):** Safe. But it leaves the top corner open for them to potentially loop around, which we don't want right now. It is a safer move if we assume they don't break corner integrity.\n3.  **RIGHT (6, 8):** DANGER! Into our own body segment (6, 8). NOPE!\n4.  **LEFT (4, 8):** DANGER! Collision with Snake #1's body segment at (4, 8). Even though it's technically a T-segment and they just vacated it, their body list is `[(4, 8), (4, 9), ...]`. If they just ate, (4, 8) remains part of their body! Death! NOPE!\n\nThe only logical and ruthlessly aggressive move is **UP to (5, 9)**. This continues the great wall of ID 0 along the y=9 row, reducing their escape options to practically zero unless they suicide into our body.\n\n**Scenario Check:**\n*   We move **UP (5, 9)**.\n*   They move **LEFT (2, 8)** (Apple).\n*   Result: We are safe. They are safe but now even further contained. Mission accomplished! We have them right where we want them!\n\nThis is a defensive move that enhances our offensive strategic position. No risk, all reward!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (T34 onwards)\n\n1.  **T34 (Current): UP** to (5, 9). Complete the top seal.\n2.  **T35:** From (5, 9), we can check their position. If they are meandering inside the box (likely at (2, 8)), we will move **LEFT (4, 9)** to complete the top boundary and prepare to patrol down towards the open central area.\n3.  **Future:** We will use our massive length to patrol the x=4, x=5, x=6 boundary, keeping them confined until they are forced to crash or starve. This is a waiting game now, but we've got the positional advantage!\n\nLet's stick the landing, Chat! UP!\n\nUP",

Here's why:\n\n1. **CONSECUTIVE APPLES:** We just grabbed (3, 8) and now we're grabbing (2, 8)!! TWO FREE APPLES in a ROW!! That's MOMENTUM!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n2. **FARMING THE SAFE ZONE:** The LEFT SIDE of the board (columns 0-2) is where we're DOMINANT!! The rival's long body can't pivot fast enough to cut us off!!\n3. **AVOIDING HEAD-ON COLLISION:** The rival at (5, 8) is moving RIGHT, which means they're moving AWAY from us or staying in the middle!! We're taking the LEFT LANE and they can't catch us!!\n4. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:** From (2, 8), we can continue to (2, 7) where there's ANOTHER APPLE!! Then pivot DOWN to grab (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1)!! We've got a ROUTE!!\n5. **GROWING OUR ADVANTAGE:** 12-16 is MUCH better than 11-16!! We're closing that gap AGGRESSIVELY!!\n6. **SURVIVAL FIRST:** We're not getting boxed in, we're farming STRATEGICALLY!!\n\n## PLAN FOR NEXT 5 TURNS (FUTURE SELF - EXECUTE THIS!!):\n- **Turn 33 (NOW):** LEFT to (2, 8) - GRAB APPLE #12!! \ud83c\udf4e (12 apples!)\n- **Turn 34:** Continue LEFT to (2, 7) - GRAB APPLE #13!! Another free one!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 35:** Assess rival position! If they're far away, go DOWN to (2, 6) and continue farming DOWN the left column!!\n- **Turn 36+:** The LEFT SIDE farms should get us to 14-15 apples quickly!! Then we START BOXING plays to cut off rival escape routes!!\n- **CRITICAL:** Watch the rival's HEAD MOVEMENT!! If they start moving LEFT toward our farming zone, pivot immediately and use our AGILITY to escape!!\n- **ENDGAME:** Once we hit 15+ apples, we shift from FARMING to CONTROL - position our body to block rival movements and force them into the walls!!\n\nLET'S KEEP THIS MOMENTUM GOING!! THE COMEBACK IS REAL!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

We are dominating this turn! We literally just created the Wall of Doom!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 34)\n\n*   **Our Head:** (5, 9). Length: 17. We own the column at x=5 and x=6, and now the top row segments (5, 9) and (6, 9) (from our tail) are massive deterrents.\n*   **Snake #1 Head:** (2, 8). Length: 13. They went LEFT and snagged the apple at (2, 8), exactly as we predicted. Smart move on their part to extend their life, but they are now pressed against the left wall.\n*   **The Box:** Snake #1 is confined to x-coordinates 0, 1, 2, 3 and y-coordinates 7, 8, 9. Their movement is severely limited.\n\n**Objective:** Initiate the squeeze! We need to move along the top wall, complete the blockade, and then begin spiraling inward or patrol the boundary until they crash. The priority is to secure the corner at (4, 9).\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Head: (2, 8))\n\nSnake #1 is at (2, 8). Where can they go?\n\n1.  **UP (2, 9):** Safe. Moves them into the corner. Highest probability move, maximizing space.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 7):** Danger! The cell (2, 7) is an apple, but they must pass through their body segments (3, 7) and (4, 7) which are T-segments. Wait, checking the board state: (2, 7) is an **Apple (A)**. This is a very tempting move. BUT, is (3, 8) still their body? Yes, their body is $[(3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), ...]$. Moving down to (2, 7) is safe *if* their tail moves out of the way. Given their long body, it is a safe maneuver.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 8):** Danger! Into their own body segment (1, 8). Insta-death! NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 8):** Danger! Into their own body segment (3, 8). Insta-death unless they just moved from there (they didn't). NOPE!\n\nSince LEFT and RIGHT are suicidal, they must go UP or DOWN.\n*   **UP (2, 9):** Keeps them along the secure top wall, likely the safer move in their desperate state.\n*   **DOWN (2, 7) (Apple):** A desperation move for food. If they go here, they are isolating themselves even further down the board.\n\nI predict they will favor **UP (2, 9)** to maximize the remaining maneuverable space in the top corner.\n\n### Your Move Evaluation from (5, 9) - COMPLETING THE WALL!\n\nWe are at (5, 9). We need to move to:\n1.  Block off the x=4/y=9 corner to fully secure the top boundary.\n2.  Maintain safety.\n\n1.  **UP (5, 10):** DANGER! Off the board. NOPE!\n2.  **DOWN (5, 8):** Safe. Moves us back into our own body's previous position. It allows us to start spiraling down, but we leave the corner (4, 9) open for them to potentially loop if we ever decide to move away. Not strategic.\n3.  **RIGHT (6, 9):** Danger! Into our own body segment (6, 9) which is the tail of the segment (5, 9). Insta-death. NOPE!\n4.  **LEFT (4, 9):** Safe! We move into an empty space. This is the optimal strategic move! It connects our wall segment at (5, 9) to the opposing snake's body segment at (4, 9). Wait, is (4, 9) their body? Yes, Snake #1 body segment is... $(4, 9)$.\n\nThis is the CRUCIAL moment, Chat. Let's analyze the collision risk at (4, 9).\n\n*   Snake #1 Body: $[(3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), ...]$\n*   (4, 9) is currently Snake #1's third segment. If they move UP to (2, 9) or DOWN to (2, 7), the body segment (4, 9) will move to a new position. If their body is long, this segment might not move.\n\nLet's look at the body shift.\nIf Snake #1 moves **UP to (2, 9)**:\n*   Their head moves to (2, 9).\n*   (3, 8) becomes the new head and moves to (2, 8). WAIT, no.\n*   The entire body shifts. The tail (1, 3) is removed. The new body will be: $[(2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4)]$.\n*   The segment $ (4, 9) $ remains in their body list. If we move to $(4, 9)$, we crash into their body and die! Phew, almost threw the game there, Chat!\n\nIf Snake #1 moves **DOWN to (2, 7)** (Apple):\n*   Their head moves to (2, 7). They eat. Growth means their tail stays at (1, 3).\n*   The new body will be: $[(2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3)]$.\n*   The segment $ (4, 9) $ remains in their body list. If we move to $(4, 9)$, we crash into their body and die!\n\nOkay, moving **LEFT (4, 9)** is suicidal regardless of their move, as (4, 9) is a core piece of their long, trapped body that will not vacate the position this turn.\n\n**Rethink: Safe moves from (5, 9):**\nOnly **DOWN to (5, 8)** is 100% safe. This is a crucial turn to not throw the lead.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (5, 8), we are safe and we patrol the boundary. They are still trapped. We can spend the next few turns tightening the spiral.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T35 onwards):**\n\n1.  **T35:** We move DOWN (5, 8). We are safe. They move to (2, 9) or (2, 7).\n2.  **T36:** We move DOWN (5, 7). We begin patrolling the x=5 column.\n3.  **T37:** We move LEFT (4, 7), checking the x=4 boundary. We will constantly squeeze them, giving them no viable exit.\n\nThis is a waiting game now, but we must be **patient.** Moving DOWN (5, 8) allows us to maintain the chokehold without risking a collision.\n\nWe are forced to make a non-aggressive move this turn to stay alive and maintain position, trusting the trap will finish the job. We must move DOWN!\n\nDOWN",

Here's why:\n\n1. **CONSECUTIVE APPLES CONTINUATION:** We just grabbed (3, 8) and (2, 8), and NOW we're grabbing (2, 7)!! THREE CONSECUTIVE APPLES!! That's UNSTOPPABLE momentum!! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n2. **FARMING THE LEFT CORRIDOR:** We're in COMPLETE CONTROL of the left side!! The rival's massive body can't pivot fast enough to intercept us!!\n3. **RIVAL IS SCATTERED:** The rival head moved UP to (5, 9) - they're moving toward the EDGE!! While they're distracted, we FARM!!\n4. **SAFE PASSAGE DOWN:** From (2, 7), we can continue DOWN to grab more apples!! The corridor is CLEAR!!\n5. **CLOSING THE GAP:** 13-16 is MUCH better than 12-16!! We're on a TEAR!!\n\n## PLAN FOR NEXT 5 TURNS (FUTURE SELF - EXECUTE THIS!!):\n- **Turn 34 (NOW):** DOWN to (2, 7) - GRAB APPLE #13!! \ud83c\udf4e (13 apples!)\n- **Turn 35:** Continue DOWN to (2, 0) - but WAIT, check if that's empty!! If YES, grab it!! That's the JACKPOT apple!! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 36:** From (2, 0), pivot and grab (3, 1) or (4, 1) - more free apples in the bottom corridor!!\n- **Turn 37+:** Keep farming the bottom-left zone!! By turn 40 we should be at 15+ apples!!\n- **CRITICAL:** Monitor rival's head movements!! If they start pivoting LEFT toward our farming zone, we pivot RIGHT into the middle and look for escape routes!!\n- **ENDGAME:** Once we hit 15+ apples, we shift to CONTROL MODE - use our body to create barriers and force the rival into unfavorable positions!!\n\nLET'S KEEP THIS WINNING STREAK ALIVE!! THE COMEBACK IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW!! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",
