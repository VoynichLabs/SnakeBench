Moves towards apples at (7, 3), (7, 0), and (2, 4).\n- **LEFT**: Moves to (4, 4). Safe. Moves towards apples at (2, 4) and (4, 6).\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to (6, 4). Safe. Moves towards apples at (7, 3) and (8, 6).\n\n**Step 2: Strategy and Enemy Consideration**\nThe enemy is at (5, 8). If I move UP and they move DOWN, we are still separated, but heading towards the same general area in the middle. The apple at (2, 4) is quite safe for me as it is far from the enemy.\n\nHowever, moving LEFT to (4, 4) puts me 2 steps away from the apple at (2, 4) and 2 steps away from (4, 6). It is a central, flexible position.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nI will move LEFT towards (2, 4). This move keeps space between me and the enemy snake and sets me up to take the closest uncontested apple. I will then evaluate whether to continue for (2, 4) or pivot to (4, 6) based on the enemy's movement.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Snake #1 is at (4, 8), which is 2 steps away from apple (4, 6).\n\n**Evaluation of potential moves:**\n- **UP**: Moves to (4, 5). This is 1 step away from (4, 6) and 3 steps from (2, 4). However, the enemy at (4, 8) is also moving toward (4, 6). They could be at (4, 7) this turn. If I move to (4, 5) and they move to (4, 7), we are only one cell apart vertically.\n- **DOWN**: Moves to (4, 3). This moves me away from the enemy and closer to (7, 3), but increases the distance to the apple at (2, 4).\n- **LEFT**: Moves to (3, 4). This is 1 step away from the apple at (2, 4). This move is safe and keeps a healthy distance from the enemy snake while securing a point.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to (5, 4). Safe, but doesn't immediately help in securing the closest apples compared to moving LEFT.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nThe enemy (Snake #1) is at (4, 8) and I am at (4, 4). The apple at (4, 6) is exactly in the middle of us. If we both move toward it, we might collide or enter a high-pressure situation. The apple at (2, 4) is much safer for me as it is further from them. \n\nBy moving LEFT, I reach (3, 4). On the following turn, I can reach (2, 4) regardless of what the enemy does.\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\nMove LEFT to (3, 4), then move LEFT again to (2, 4) to collect the apple.

This will increase my length to 3 and my score to 2.\n- **Snake #1:** They are at (7, 7). They are likely targeting (8, 6) or (5, 9).

The next closest apples will be (7, 0) and (7, 3). \n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (4, 1) to collect the apple. From there, I will likely move toward (7, 0) or (7, 3) depending on Snake #1's movement. Snake #1 is currently at (7, 7), so (7, 3) is a contested area.

Snake #1 is at (5, 1). If it moves LEFT to (4, 1), we are still separated by one column. If it moves UP to (5, 2), we are separated.\n2. **DOWN (3, 0):** **SAFE.** Moves toward the bottom wall. No immediate threat, but slows down apple collection.\n3. **LEFT (2, 1):** **SAFE.** Moves toward the left wall, away from Snake #1. \n4. **RIGHT (4, 1):** **INVALID.** This is my neck/body.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nI am currently trailing Snake #1 (3 apples vs 5). I need to secure the nearest apple at (3, 3) to narrow the gap. Snake #1's head is at (5, 1), and its body is trailing upwards and right. Snake #1 cannot move LEFT to (4, 1) without hitting my body segment that is currently there (though that segment will move this turn, the head-on logic or body-collision timing makes (4, 1) a dangerous spot for them). If they move UP to (5, 2), they are moving toward the center. By moving UP to (3, 2), I am one step away from the apple at (3, 3).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to (3, 2), then UP again to (3, 3) to collect the apple. From (3, 3), I will evaluate the path to either (1, 4) or (3, 6). I must ensure I don't get boxed into the left side of the board by Snake #1. Currently, Snake #1 occupies a significant portion of the right-center, so I will prioritize the apples on the left.\n\nUP",

Moving LEFT toward the wall at (0, y) reduces my escape routes if Snake #1 moves to intercept me. Additionally, apple (3, 6) is on my current X-axis, making the pathing very efficient.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to (3, 5), then UP again to collect the apple at (3, 6).

Moving DOWN would keep me away from the enemy and my own body, and give me more options for the next turn.\n\n**Best Move:**\nLEFT is the best move because:\n- It keeps me alive.\n- It moves me to the apple at (5,9), which is the closest apple.\n- It gives me more options for the next turn to move towards the closest apple at (5,7) or (3,9).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter moving left, I'll reassess the board. The next closest apple would be at (5,7), which would require moving down. I should continue to monitor the enemy's movements and try to maintain distance while collecting apples efficiently.\n\nLEFT",

The closest remaining apples are at (7, 4) and (8, 4). Moving UP is the most direct path to these targets. The enemy snake is currently at the top of the board (3, 8) and is likely focused on the apples at (3, 9) and (8, 9). \n\n- **UP to (7, 3)** puts me one step away from (7, 4). \n- **RIGHT to (8, 2)** is safe but moves me further from the current apple cluster.\n- **DOWN to (7, 1)** is safe but inefficient for scoring right now.\n\nI must be mindful that the enemy head at (3, 8) is far away, but they could eventually contest the (8, 9) or (8, 4) area. By going UP now, I secure a position to take the two middle-right apples quickly.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to (7, 3), then UP again to (7, 4) to collect that apple. From (7, 4), move RIGHT to (8, 4) for the next apple. This path keeps me away from the enemy while maximizing score.\n\nUP",

Moving UP would take me to the apple at (3,9), which is the closest apple.\n2. Moving LEFT would take me away from the apples and towards the enemy.\n3. Moving RIGHT would take me towards the apples at (8,4) and (7,4).\n\n**Best Move:**\nUP is the best move because:\n- It keeps me alive.\n- It moves me to the apple at (3,9), which is the closest apple.\n- It gives me more options for the next turn to move towards the next closest apples.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter moving up, I'll reassess the board.

It is safe from the enemy head (at 4, 9).\n2. **UP (7, 5):** Safe, but moves away from the immediate apple at (8, 4).\n3. **DOWN (7, 3):** **INVALID.** This is my neck/body.\n4. **LEFT (6, 4):** Safe, but moves away from the apple.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nI just collected the apple at (7, 4). The next most accessible apple is at (8, 4). Moving RIGHT will collect it, bringing my score to 11 and giving me the lead. The enemy is at the top of the board (row 9) and likely heading for the apple at (8, 9). I am far enough away to avoid any immediate conflict. After taking (8, 4), I will have to decide between heading back towards the cluster at (1, 1) and (2, 0) or moving toward (1, 6).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (8, 4) to take the lead. From (8, 4), I cannot move further right (board edge), so I will likely move UP or DOWN. Given the current body configuration, moving DOWN towards (8, 0) and then hooking LEFT towards the apples at (2, 0) and (1, 1) seems like a safe way to clear my trail and prepare for the next phase, as the enemy is congested in the top-right quadrant.\n\nRIGHT",

My snake is 10 segments long (head at (4,9), body at (3,9), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (7,8)).\n2. The enemy snake is 10 segments long (head at (7,4), body at (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (4,2), (3,2), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4)).\n3. The closest apples to me are at (8,9) (right) and (8,4) (right and down).\n4. The enemy is to my left and down at (7,4), but not an immediate threat.\n\n**Safe Moves Analysis:**\n- UP: (4,10) - off the board (suicide).\n- DOWN: (4,8) - safe (no collision, on board).\n- LEFT: (3,9) - would hit my own body (suicide).\n- RIGHT: (5,9) - safe (no collision, on board).\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n1. Moving DOWN would take me away from the apples and towards the enemy.\n2. Moving RIGHT would take me towards the apples at (8,9) and (8,4).\n\n**Best Move:**\nRIGHT is the best move because:\n- It keeps me alive.\n- It moves me towards the apples at (8,9) and (8,4).\n- It gives me more options for the next turn to move towards the next closest apples.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter moving right, I'll reassess the board. The next closest apples would be at (8,9) and (8,4), which would require moving right and down. I should continue to monitor the enemy's movements and try to maintain distance while collecting apples efficiently.\n\nRIGHT",
