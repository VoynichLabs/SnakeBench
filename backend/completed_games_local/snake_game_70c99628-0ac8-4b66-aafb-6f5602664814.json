They have several options, but they are likely looking at the apples at (8, 2), (7, 1), or (9, 9). \n\nThe nearest apple to me is at **(1, 2)**. \n- Path to (1, 2) from (2, 5): 1 move Left, 3 moves Down (Total 4 turns).\n- Path to (5, 0) from (2, 5): 3 moves Right, 5 moves Down (Total 8 turns).\n\nSnake #1 is closer to the right-side apples. Pursuing (8, 2) or (7, 1) directly might lead to a confrontation or being cut off since Snake #1 is already at x=5. My best strategy is to secure the bottom-left area, specifically the apple at **(1, 2)**, then pivot toward **(5, 0)**.\n\nBetween DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT:\n- **DOWN** (2, 4) reduces the distance to (1, 2) to 3 steps.\n- **LEFT** (1, 5) reduces the distance to (1, 2) to 3 steps.\n- **RIGHT** (3, 5) moves me away from (1, 2).\n\nMoving **DOWN** is slightly better than LEFT because it maintains more central flexibility and keeps me further away from Snake #1's potential horizontal movement.\n\n### Long-term Plan:\nHead toward (1, 2) to increase score to 2. Once collected, assess the position of Snake #1. If they are moving toward (8, 2), I will contest (5, 0) or move toward the top-right apple at (9, 9) if the path is clear.

This creates a vertical wall directly to my right on the x=5 line. \n3.  **Snake #1's Movement**: Their head is at (6, 0). They are close to apples at (7, 1) and (8, 2) and just ate at (6, 0). \n4.  **Available Options**: \n    *   **UP (4, 3)**: Moves away from the dense activity at the bottom. It provides flexibility to circle around Snake #1's tail once it moves.\n    *   **DOWN (4, 1)**: Puts me directly adjacent to Snake #1's body (5, 1) and positions me for the apple at (4, 0). \n\n### Risk Assessment:\nIf I move **DOWN** to (4, 1), and Snake #1 moves **LEFT** to (5, 0), I am safe but boxed in. However, the apple at (4, 0) is very tempting. \nIf I move **UP** to (4, 4), I play it safe and wait for Snake #1 to clear the x=5 line.\n\nHowever, since Snake #1's head is at (6, 0), they are likely moving RIGHT toward (7, 1) or (8, 2). Moving **DOWN** to (4, 1) allows me to grab the apple at (4, 0) on the next turn. Snake #1 cannot reach (4, 0) this turn or the next (dist calc: (6,0) to (4,0) is 2 steps, same as me, but they would have to move through their own body or around it).\n\nMoving **DOWN** is the most aggressive play for the nearest apple. Moving **UP** is the safest play for long-term positioning. Given the score is 2-3, I need to keep pace.\n\n### Long-term Plan:\nMove DOWN to (4, 1) then DOWN to (4, 0) to collect the apple. This will put me at the bottom edge. After collecting (4, 0), I will likely need to move LEFT or UP to stay away from the corner unless Snake #1 moves further right.\n\nDOWN",
