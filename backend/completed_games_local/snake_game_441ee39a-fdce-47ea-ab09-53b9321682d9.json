Both UP (to 3,8) and LEFT (to 2,7) reduce distance to (2,9) to 2 and keep multiple follow-up options open (e.g., the upper-left area remains spacious with no walls or bodies). DOWN (to 3,6) or RIGHT (to 4,7) increase distance to (2,9) and pull toward denser apple clusters in the mid/bottom-right, which might invite enemy competition later or trap me if enemy maneuvers there.\n\nEnemy is a similar size/one-segment, so focus on maneuvering to (2,9) quickly while staying 4-5+ manhattan away to avoid future head-on collisions (enemy heads will move simultaneously). LEFT feels slightly better than UP for closing the x-gap toward (2,9)'s corner, keeping the path shorter (direct then up) and providing tighter control versus UP (which goes up the column and might require extra sidesteps later). No preference on offer from last rationale's UP\u2014LEFT builds on it naturally.\n\nLong-term plan for next few turns: Proceed to (2,9) via LEFT and/or UP to minimize detours, collecting the apple along the way. After that, pivot toward the bottom cluster ((5,2), (6,3), (9,3)), prioritizing whichever isn't claimed by enemy (likely (6,3) or (5,2) next based on distances). Monitor enemy path to (7,6) and stay vigilant for head-on risks, preferring open areas like the bottom-left over the upper-right where enemy might lurk. If enemy picks up (7,6), reconsider rushing bottom apples if I can box them in safely; otherwise, use extra turns to outmaneuver.\n\nLEFT",

UP from (2,7) to (2,8) reduces the gap to 1, directly lining me up for the next turn, while leaving multiple follow-ups (e.g., RIGHT to (3,8) for later pivots or LEFT back if needed).

They're far away and not an immediate threat to my planned path.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- LEFT to (5, 3) is the only viable safe move (UP and DOWN both kill me)\n- This move positions me perfectly to go DOWN to (5, 2) next turn to collect that apple\n- This keeps my options open and continues my progress toward the nearest apple\n\n**Plan:**\n- Turn 7: Move LEFT to (5, 3)\n- Turn 8: Move DOWN to (5, 2) to collect the apple\n- Continue collecting nearby apples while monitoring enemy movements\n\nLEFT",

This would extend me upward and keep my options open.\n\n2. **DOWN to (5, 2)**: This cell contains an apple! Moving here would let me collect it and grow. However, I need to consider what happens afterward. After collecting, my body would be [(5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3)]. From there, my next moves would be more limited - I'd be somewhat \"curled\" and might have fewer escape routes.\n\n3. **LEFT to (4, 3)**: This cell appears empty, but moving left further constrains my position and doesn't directly progress toward any apples.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 3)**: This was my previous position. Since my body followed me when I moved LEFT, (6, 3) is now occupied by my body segment. Moving here would be suicide.\n\n**Apple Proximity Analysis:**\n- (5, 2) is right below me - closest and most accessible\n- (8, 1) is farther away\n- Other apples are even more distant\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\nWhile (5, 2) contains an apple and DOWN seems tempting, I need to think ahead. After moving DOWN:\n- My body would be: [(5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3)]\n- From there, UP would take me back to (5, 3) where I just was\n- RIGHT from (5, 2) would go to (6, 2) - need to check if that's safe\n- LEFT from (5, 2) would go to (4, 2)\n\nThe key question is: does collecting this apple now put me in a better or worse position for future moves?\n\nAlternatively, if I move UP to (5, 4):\n- I maintain a straighter, more flexible body configuration\n- From (5, 4), I could later move DOWN to (5, 3), LEFT to (4, 4), RIGHT to (6, 4), or continue UP\n- This keeps more options open\n\n**Enemy Position:**\nSnake #0 is at the top of the board (6, 9) with body at (5, 9). They're far away and not an immediate threat to my current position or the (5, 2) apple.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nWhile DOWN to collect (5, 2) would give me an immediate point, moving UP to (5, 4) is strategically better because:\n1. It keeps my body in a more flexible, extended configuration\n2. It maintains more safe movement options for future turns\n3. I'm not in immediate danger of being trapped\n4. I can always go back down to (5, 2) on a future turn\n\nThe apple at (5, 2) will still be there, and I can collect it later when my position is more optimal. Prioritizing body positioning over immediate point collection is the smarter long-term strategy.\n\nUP",

No, the body list will update, but initially, moving to a cell that's your own body? Rules say into any snake's body dies, including own.

From new head (8,7), follow-ups: up (8,8), down (8,6) into new body, left (7,7) into (7,7) own, right (9,7). So only up or right, 2 options, potential trap if up leads to wall. No apple near, and going up away from apples.\n\nDOWN to (8,5): new head (8,5), body [(8,6),(7,6),(7,7),(7,8)]; follow-ups from (8,5): up (8,6) own, down (8,4), left (7,5), right (9,5).

So up (9,7), down (9,5); 2 options, along col9, toward (9,3) via down, potential trap after eating if cornered at y=0, but space now.\n\nPrioritizing (9,3) as per last plan since enemy will likely head east to (8,1) first (e.g., they can reach y=1 quicker than y=3), and (9,3) is 5 moves: right to (9,6), down 3 to (9,3). (8,1) also ~5 moves south, maintain options. DOWN to (8,5) moves toward (8,1) more directly, with 3 follow-ups, but deviates from (9,3) priority; last plan favored east toward (9,3) for advantage. UP moves away, loses multiple options after move, poor for apple proximity.\n\nRIGHT keeps exactly 2 safe follow-ups but aligns with plan, maintains lead; DOWN has more immediate options but risks if enemy contests east soon. Favor RIGHT for quicker access to (9,3) via right-down path, monitor enemy east movement.\n\nShort-term plan for next few turns: Right to (9,6), then continue down each turn along col9 toward (9,3) at (9,3), eating in 3 more moves (to (9,6) down to (9,3)). After eating, assess: if enemy is east/south near (8,1), go left to (8,3) from (9,3), down/right toward (8,1). If enemy west or neutral, consider (3,9) north or fallback apples.

DOWN better advances toward (9,3) (5 moves total from start of plan), a closer or equidistant goal where enemy (at (6,2)) likely targets east-south (e.g., (8,1)). Enemy's safe moves: RIGHT to (7,2) or DOWN to (6,1), neither directly threatening yet; no imminent head-on collision. After eating (9,3), pivot left (e.g., to (8,3)) for (8,1) if contested, or consider (3,9) northwest; maintain at least 2 options to avoid traps. Stay cautious of enemy simultaneous paths.\n\nDOWN",

The enemy is occupying the right edge of the board at x=9 from y=2 to y=6.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving DOWN to (9, 0) is optimal because it:\n- Collects the apple at (9, 0), extending my lead to 5 apples\n- Moves me away from the enemy snake which is directly above me\n- Keeps options open for future moves (LEFT to (8, 0) or continuing along the bottom row)\n- Is the only safe move available to me\n\nThis move gives me a clear advantage and positions me to potentially go after the apple at (6, 0) next turn.\n\nDOWN",
