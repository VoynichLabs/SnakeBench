My snake is at (7,3) with body segments at (7,4), (8,4), (8,3), (9,3), and (9,4).\n2. The enemy snake is at (5,3), with body segments at (6,3), (6,2), and (7,2).\n3. The closest apples are at (4,5) (3 units left and 2 units up) and (3,8) (4 units left and 5 units up).\n4. The apple at (9,9) is 6 units up but requires moving right, which is unsafe (my own body).\n\n**Safe Moves Analysis:**\n- UP: (7,4) - my own body, unsafe (would kill me)\n- DOWN: (7,2) - enemy body, unsafe (would kill me)\n- LEFT: (6,3) - enemy body, unsafe (would kill me)\n- RIGHT: (8,3) - my own body, unsafe (would kill me)\n\nAll moves are unsafe. This is a critical situation.\n\n**Re-evaluating:**\n- The enemy snake is at (5,3), and their body is at (6,3), (6,2), and (7,2).\n- My body is at (7,4), (8,4), (8,3), (9,3), and (9,4).\n- The only possible safe move is to move UP to (7,4), but that is my own body. This seems like a dead end.\n\n**Potential Enemy Moves:**\n- The enemy is at (5,3). If they move UP, they would move toward (5,4), which is empty space.\n- If they move LEFT, they would move toward (4,3), which is empty space.\n- If they move RIGHT, they would move toward (6,3), which is their own body, so they would die.\n- If they move DOWN, they would move toward (5,2), which is empty space.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll moves are unsafe. This seems like a dead end. However, if the enemy moves RIGHT, they would die, and their body would disappear, potentially freeing up space.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven the current state, all moves are unsafe. However, if the enemy moves RIGHT, they would die, and their body would disappear, potentially freeing up space. Therefore, I will choose a move that might be safe if the enemy moves RIGHT.\n\n**Long-term note for next turn:**\n\"All moves are unsafe. If the enemy moves RIGHT, they would die, and their body would disappear, potentially freeing up space. Next move should consider the enemy's position and the path to the apples at (4,5), (3,8), (5,9), and (9,9).\"\n\nUP",
