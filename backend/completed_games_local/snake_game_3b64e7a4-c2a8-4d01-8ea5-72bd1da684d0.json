Enemy snake #1 is at (0,4) with body (1,4), (2,4), (2,5).\n\nThe apples are at (0,2), (9,2), (4,0), (0,7), (6,4).\n\nFirst, consider immediate deaths:\n- Moving UP: (5,4). This is safe.\n- Moving DOWN: (5,2). This is safe.\n- Moving LEFT: (4,3). This is the location of part of my body, so it results in death.\n- Moving RIGHT: (6,3). This is safe.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are safe moves.\n\nNow consider the apples and possible future positions.\n- Moving UP: (5,4). The closest apple is at (6,4). After moving UP, moving RIGHT next turn leads to an apple.\n- Moving DOWN: (5,2). The closest apple might be (9,2) or (4,0). It moves us away from that cluster of apples at (6,4), (0,7).\n- Moving RIGHT: (6,3). The closest apples are at (6,4) or (9,2).\n\nAlso take into account the other snake: Snake #1 is at (0,4) with body (1,4), (2,4), (2,5).\nSnake #1's possible moves this turn:\n- UP: (0,5)\n- DOWN: (0,3)\n- LEFT: (-1,4) - which is off the board, and thus lethal.\n- RIGHT: (1,4) - which is fine.\n\nIf snake #1 moves UP to (0,5), it becomes slightly less of a concern. If snake #1 moves DOWN to (0,3), it moves closer to the apples at (0,2) and (0,7).\n\nIf I move UP to (5,4), and Snake #1 moves DOWN to (0,3), there won't be any collisions. Furthermore, moving UP lets me move RIGHT to grab the apple at (6,4).\n\nThe current score difference is only 1, so I want to prioritize grabbing apples.\n\nLong-term plan: Move toward (6,4) apple. If that becomes too risky, move toward (0,7). Avoid the left side of the board due to Snake #1 potentially growing and blocking.\nI will choose move UP.\n\nUP",

After that eat, my tail will not move, so the square I just left (9,2) becomes part of my body and DOWN would be a backward move (illegal) on the following turn. From (9,3) I would have only UP and LEFT as follow-ups (RIGHT off-board, DOWN is into my neck). That still works, but it makes reaching (8,1) trickier because moving into (8,2) later could collide with my own body depending on timing.\n- DOWN does not eat this turn, so the tail will move forward and free up space. From (9,1) I can then go LEFT to (8,1) next turn to eat that apple cleanly. There are no nearby enemy heads to contest those apples, so timing is safe.\n- DOWN therefore preserves straightforward access to the nearby apple at (8,1) on the next turn and keeps more immediate escape options than eating on the wall right now.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move DOWN to (9,1) this turn, then LEFT to (8,1) to eat that apple.

RIGHT: (5, 8) - Safe.\n\nLet's consider the apples.\n- (9, 3) is far away to the right and up.\n- (7, 5), (7, 6) are somewhat down and to the right.\n- (1, 2) is far away to the left and down.\n- (6, 5) is down and to the right.\n\nNow let's evaluate the moves:\n- UP: Takes me to (4, 9). This keeps options open to go to the right towards the apple at (9, 3) or down towards the apples at (7, 5) and (7, 6).\n- DOWN: Takes me to (4, 7). This keeps options open towards the apples at (7, 5) and (7, 6).\n- RIGHT: Takes me to (5, 8). Seems less promising than moving up or down.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (4, 0). It doesn't seem to pose an immediate threat.\n\nGiven the apple distribution, moving DOWN or UP seems like a good move. UP might be slightly better to open my options for both upper and lower apples next move.\n\nFuture plan:\nNext turn I should consider moving towards the apple at (7,5) or (7,6).\n\nUP",

No apple on either, so my tail (currently at (8,2)) will vacate this turn.\n\nComparison:\n- LEFT (to 3,0) keeps me on the bottom row. After that I\u2019d have LEFT (2,0) or UP (3,1) as follow-ups, but staying on y=0 limits vertical escape options and may funnel me along the edge.\n- UP (to 4,1) moves me into more open space with multiple exits (LEFT to 3,1, RIGHT to 5,1, UP to 4,2). It also better positions me to head toward the cluster of apples near (6,5)/(7,5)/(7,6) or swing left/up to (1,2) if needed.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy head is at (4,8), far away\u2014no immediate head-on threat.\n- Neither move causes self-collision this turn, and UP preserves more safe follow-ups.\n\nShort long-term plan:\n- Move into open space (UP) to retain options. Then navigate towards the nearest promising apple cluster (prefer (6,5)/(7,5)/(7,6) for multiple nearby apples) while avoiding getting boxed in by my own body.

It might lead to the apples at (7,5), (7,6) and (6,5), but I might get trapped.\n-RIGHT to (7, 9) looks also interesting. It opens up the possibility towards apple at (9,3)\n\nLet's think about enemy snake.

The closest apples are (7, 5), (7, 6), (6, 5). Going right could lead to the apple at (9,3). Also, it keeps my options open.\n\nFuture Plan:\nIf I go RIGHT this turn, the apple at (9, 3) is the main target. The apple at (7, 5) and (7, 6) are also options. I should also consider that the enemy is at (4, 3). If the enemy heads towards the row 3, I need to be careful.\n\nRIGHT",

The apple at (0, 8) seems safest and closest. The other snake doesn't seem to be targeting it.

I can reach it in two moves via UP then LEFT or LEFT then UP. Enemy head at (2,8) can also reach it in two moves (DOWN then RIGHT), so this is contested. Going LEFT now maximizes my escape choices and keeps pressure on that apple.\n- Other apples (0,8) and (1,2) are further; keeping space and mobility is the priority to contest/rotate toward them later.\n\nShort-term plan (for next turns):\n- Move LEFT now to (3,6). If safe, next turn go UP to (3,7) to try to secure that apple while being ready to pivot away if the enemy contests.\n- Avoid moving into the x=4 vertical column (DOWN unsafe in mid-term). Keep lateral freedom to approach top-left apples (0,8) or swing down to (1,2) later.\n- Avoid stepping onto or adjacent to the enemy\u2019s long row at y=8 where possible to reduce head-on and trapping risks.\n\nMove decision:\nLEFT",

RIGHT: (2, 1) Safe.\n\nLet's consider the apple positions and the enemy snake.\nThe closest apple seems to be potentially the one at (7, 3) and (6,0) or those far on the east. Snake 1 at (5,3), is quite close to the apple at (7,3).\n\nAnalyzing each move a bit further:\n- UP: Definitely deadly, collision.\n- DOWN: (1, 0). This gets me closer to two apples at (9,0) and (6,0).\n- LEFT: (0, 1). Going left potentially limits choices on next turns, the board edge is nearby.\n- RIGHT: (2, 1). Looks relatively safe. This moves away from apples at (6,0), (7,3), (9,0).\n\nSnake #1 is at (5, 3). Possible moves for snake #1:\n- UP: (5, 4)\n- DOWN: (5, 2)\n- LEFT: (4, 3)\n- RIGHT: (6, 3)\n\nLet's trace possible scenarios:\n\nMe DOWN to (1, 0):\nSnake #1 goes...\n- UP: (5, 4) - Safe for me\n- DOWN: (5, 2) - Safe for me\n- LEFT: (4, 3) - Safe for me\n- RIGHT: (6, 3) - Safe for me.

There would be just two options next turn.\n- RIGHT: (2, 0). This moves me closer to the apple (6,0) and potentially (7,3) later.\n\nSnake #1 is at (6, 3).

RIGHT: (3, 0) - Safe\n\nSo, the only possible moves are UP and RIGHT.\n\nEvaluating UP:\n- New position: (2, 1). The next turn opens:\n    - UP: (2, 2)\n    - DOWN: (2, 0)\n    - LEFT: (1, 1) death\n    - RIGHT: (3, 1)\nEnemy snake #1 is at (7,3), possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT.

The apple at (1,5) is close but getting there might be difficult.\n\nEvaluating RIGHT:\n- New position: (3, 0). The next options are:\n    - UP: (3,1)\n    - DOWN: (3, -1) - death\n    - LEFT: (2, 0)\n    - RIGHT: (4, 0)\nThis positions me better long term for an apple at (6,0) and (9,0) along the bottom edges of the board.\n\nI prioritize survival and moving towards apples closer to the bottom edge. Snake #1 is near the top of the board, so it is not conflicting with my desired area.\n\nTo make the decision, let's consider where each move takes me relative to nearby apples and any potential dangers. snake #1 has a larger body length, and avoiding it is crucial. Currently, going UP puts me more in the center of the board where snake #1 could more easily intersect me. The best long-term strategy is to stay closer to the walls where it is less likely to have another snake intersect my path.\n\nLong-term plan: Prioritize (6,0) and (9,0). Avoid snake #1, move along the lower edge.\n\nRIGHT",

If it chooses UP, moving LEFT to (8,0) is safe.\n- Given the nearby apple at (7,2), the enemy is plausibly more likely to go UP toward that apple than to move RIGHT into open space. There is still some risk of a head-on if the enemy moves RIGHT, but LEFT is the only allowed legal move for me.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move to (8,0) this turn.\n- Immediately reassess enemy movement next turn. If enemy did not move into (8,0), proceed to (8,1) and then contest the nearby apple at (7,2) or head up the right side to reach other apples while avoiding tight loops of my own body.\n- If enemy moved into (8,0) and a collision occurs, that outcome is unavoidable this turn.\n\nLEFT",

UP: (7, 3) - Safe.\n2. DOWN: (7, 1) - Collides with body so death.\n3. LEFT: (6, 2) - Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (8, 2) - Safe.\n\nThe safe moves are UP, LEFT and RIGHT. Let's consider each:\n- Moving UP: (7, 3). Safe. The body of snake #1 is sitting at (7,3) so if they move down it is head on.\n- Moving LEFT: (6, 2). Safe.\n- Moving RIGHT: (8, 2). Safe.\n\nLet's look at apple positions: (9, 8), (1, 5), (4, 9), (8, 8), (4, 1).\n\nConsider the opponent. If the opponent goes DOWN, they will die (head on collision). If they go LEFT, they bump into your body part (7,1).\nIf they go UP, they go to (8,2) and if you go RIGHT you die (head on collision). Thus, it is safest to move UP or LEFT.\n\nGoing up gets further away from all the apples.\nGoing right might result in the opponent moving up and causing a head on collision if we follow that next turn.\nGoing left seems reasonable, and opens up either UP or DOWN next move.\n\nNew Plan: Move towards (4, 9). Be carefully of the other snake.\nUP",

Its legal moves are LEFT (6,2), RIGHT (8,2), or UP (7,3). UP would move into my body and kill it (unlikely unless suicidal); RIGHT would cause a head-on collision at (8,2) if I go there. LEFT is a safe alternative for it. I cannot avoid the potential head-on this turn because UP is the only legal non-fatal move for me.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Move up now to (8,2) and immediately reassess enemy movement. If enemy contested and caused a head-on, accept the unavoidable outcome. If enemy avoids (8,2), continue moving up the right side to contest apples at (8,8)/(9,8) while keeping space to retreat and avoid being trapped against enemy body.\n\nUP",
