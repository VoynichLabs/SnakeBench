Currently, the snake's head is at (8, 0) with body extending upward to (8, 4). The immediate danger is moving **UP**, which would collide with the body segment at (8, 1), causing death. **DOWN** is invalid because it would move off the board. This leaves **LEFT** and **RIGHT** as the only safe moves. \n\nMoving **LEFT** to (7, 0) opens a path toward the apple at (7, 6). The snake could then ascend vertically from (7, 1) onward, avoiding self-collisions since the body would shift eastward to (8, 0), (8, 1), etc. This path minimizes risks of future collisions and aligns toward a reachable apple. \n\nConversely, moving **RIGHT** to (9, 0) forces the snake to traverse the board's edge before turning upward toward (8, 6). While safe now, this route is longer and exposes the snake to potential edge-related hazards or enemy movements toward the same column-8 apples. \n\nGiven the enemy snake is far in column 4, the priority is to avoid immediate risks and focus on maximizing apple access. **LEFT** is chosen to advance toward the (7, 6) apple efficiently while maintaining flexibility. \n\n**Rationale for future turns**: Continue prioritizing upward movement toward column-7 or column-8 apples once the body has shifted eastward. Avoid committing to a single column unless necessary. Monitor enemy movements closely, especially if they enter column 7 or 8, and adjust paths to avoid head-on collisions. Always prioritize collecting apples to outpace the enemy's growth.\n\nLEFT",
