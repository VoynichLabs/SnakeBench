Moving UP puts me on the optimal path. On subsequent turns, I'll need to:\n1. Continue UP to eat the apple at (0,4)\n2. Watch for the enemy snake's movements and avoid head-on collisions\n3.

My new head will be at (0,6), body at (0,5), tail at (0,3).\n- **DOWN** to (0,4): **DEAD** - My body segment is at (0,4). Moving backwards into my own body kills me.\n- **LEFT** to (-1,5): **DEAD** - Off the board, cannot choose this.\n- **RIGHT** to (1,5): **SAFE** - Empty cell. My new head will be at (1,5), body at (0,5), tail at (0,4).\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n1. **Apple Priority**: All remaining apples are at least 4-5 moves away. The closest is (3,8) at 6 moves (3 right, 3 up), or (4,8) at 8 moves (4 right, 3 up).\n2. **Enemy Position**: The enemy snake is at (5,0) and will move simultaneously. Let me check if it can reach me this turn - it would need to move LEFT 5 times and UP 5 times, which is impossible, so I won't collide with it.\n3. **Board Position**: I'm on the left edge. Moving UP keeps me on the edge where the apple at (0,9) is located. Moving RIGHT takes me away from the edge but gives more flexibility.\n4. **Future Options**: Moving UP will put me closer to the apple at (0,9), which is the next logical target on the left edge. However, I should also consider the apple at (3,8) which is closer diagonally.\n\n### Move Selection\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe. Let me evaluate which is better:\n- **UP** to (0,6): Keeps me on the left edge, closer to (0,9) apple (3 moves away). Still 4 moves from (3,8).\n- **RIGHT** to (1,5): Takes me away from the edge but gives more flexibility for future moves. Still 6 moves from (3,8).\n\nSince I have a 2-1 lead and there are no immediate threats, I should prioritize positioning myself for the nearest apple while maintaining flexibility. The apple at (3,8) is closer than (0,9) if I consider a more direct path.\n\n**Move: RIGHT**\n\nRIGHT",

Not strategically helpful.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT, both are good options. UP gets me closer to (3,8) which requires fewer total moves. RIGHT gets me closer to (6,5) which is also accessible.

Moving UP gets me to (0, 7), then UP again gets me to (0, 8), then UP again gets me to the apple at (0, 9).\n\n**Enemy movements this turn**: Snake #0 at (6, 2) can move to:\n- (6, 3) UP\n- (6, 1) DOWN (body) - DEAD\n- (5, 2) LEFT\n- (7, 2) RIGHT\n\nThe most likely moves are UP to (6, 3) or LEFT to (5, 2) or RIGHT to (7, 2).\n\n**Board position**: I'm currently against the left wall (x=0). Moving UP keeps me in a good position to reach (0, 9) and gives me more room to maneuver.\n\n**Move Selection**: Between UP and DOWN, UP is clearly better because:\n1. It positions me to eat the very close apple at (0, 9) next turn\n2. It keeps me away from the bottom of the board where the enemy is located\n3. It maintains my position near the left wall for potential future maneuvers\n\n## Plan\nMove UP to (0, 7), then next turn UP again to (0, 8), and then UP to eat the apple at (0, 9) on turn 9. This gives me 3 apples total. I should continue monitoring the enemy's position and adjust if they threaten my path to the apple.\n\nUP",

Every snake's head moves one cell in its chosen direction at the same time.\n- If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point (1 apple).\n- If you move outside the board (beyond the listed coordinate ranges), you die.\n- If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\n- Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\n- If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\n- If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die (head-on collision).\n- If all snakes die on the same turn for any reason, the game ends immediately and the snake with more apples at that moment wins; if apples are tied, the game is a draw.\n- The game ends immediately when any snake reaches 50 apples. If multiple snakes reach 50 or more on the same turn, the snake with the higher apple count wins that round; if tied, it is a draw.\n- The game lasts at most 150 turns.\n- If at any point all opponents are dead and you are alive, you immediately win.\n- If multiple snakes are still alive at the final turn, the snake with the most apples wins. If apples are tied at the end of the game, the game is a draw.\n\nObjective and strategy:\n- You cannot win if you are dead, so never choose a move that obviously kills you.\n- Among the moves that keep you alive, prefer moves that both:\n  * increase your chance of safely eating apples, and\n  * keep future options open (avoid getting trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends).\n\nDecision process for each move:\n1) Consider all four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n2) Eliminate any move that would immediately kill you (off the board, into your own body including backwards, or into another snake's body).\n3) Among remaining safe moves, favor moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available and move you closer to reachable apples while avoiding likely head-on collisions (remember enemy heads will also move this turn).\n\nYou may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\nYou may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\nCoordinate reminder: decreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right. Decreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nThe final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.",
