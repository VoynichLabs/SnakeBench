After that move the cell above (3,5) is still occupied by our body, so an immediate upward move would still be blocked and the new head would be adjacent to several of our own segments, limiting flexibility.  \n- **RIGHT** moves the head to (5,4). This column is completely empty, keeps the cell (4,5) still occupied (so we cannot move up immediately) but it creates a clear corridor to the empty cells (5,5), (5,6), etc., allowing us to climb upward in future turns toward the apple at (5,9) and later loop back to (4,7). It also keeps us far from the enemy head at (8,6) and avoids any head\u2011on collision risk.\n\n**Plan:**  \nShift right to column\u202f5, then climb upward toward the apple at (5,\u202f9) and later circle back to (4,\u202f7).
