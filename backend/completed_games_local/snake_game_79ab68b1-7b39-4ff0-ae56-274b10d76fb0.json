It avoids the restrictive right edge and positions the snake closer to the central/apple area for future turns.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move LEFT to get closer to the center. After that, aim for the apple at (6,1) or (6,0) depending on the enemy snake's movement (it is currently near (6,0) so I should be cautious of a head-on collision there).\n\nLEFT",

The board visual shows 'A's at: (1,8), (2,4), (2,2), (6,1), (3,1). These match exactly.\n    *   **Target Apples:** The apples are located at (1,8), (2,4), (2,2), (3,1), (6,1). The enemy is at (6,0), near the apple at (6,1).\n\n**Movement Options Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **UP:** Move to (7, 3).\n    *   Status: Valid.\n    *   Collision: No body. No apple.\n    *   Strategy: Moving away from the lower-center cluster of apples. Not optimal.\n2.  **DOWN:** Move to (7, 1).\n    *   Status: Valid.\n    *   Collision: No body. No apple. (Apple is at 6,1).\n    *   Strategy: Moves closer to the apple at (6,1), but I'm moving directly towards the lane the enemy is currently in. If the enemy moves UP to (6,1), we collide. If I move DOWN, I am at (7,1).\n3.  **LEFT:** Move to (6, 2).\n    *   Status: Valid.\n    *   Collision: No body. No apple.\n    *   Strategy: Moves closer to (6,1) and (3,1). Creates a diagonal approach to the apple cluster.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Move to (8, 2).\n    *   Status: Valid.\n    *   Collision: No body. No apple.\n    *   Strategy: Moves away from the central apples. Bad option.\n\n**Comparison:**\nThe best apples are at (6,1) and (3,1). The enemy is at (6,0). If I move **DOWN** to (7,1), I risk the enemy moving UP to (6,1) causing a head-on collision (or me surviving if I am closer? No, if I am at 7,1 and he is at 6,0 and moves UP to 6,1, we are not in the same cell. He is at 6,1, I am at 7,1. Safe. But if he moves RIGHT to (7,0), I am at 7,1. Safe. If he moves LEFT to (5,0), safe. If he moves DOWN, he dies.\nIf I move **LEFT** to (6,2), I am directly above the apple at (6,1). This gives me a secure position to eat the apple next turn if the enemy doesn't take it.\nIf I move **DOWN** to (7,1), I am to the right of the apple at (6,1). If the enemy moves UP to (6,1), I am at (7,1) and safe. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (7,0), I am at (7,1) and safe.\nActually, moving **LEFT** puts me on the X-axis of the target apple (6,1). Moving DOWN puts me on the Y-axis but offset.\nLet's look at the apple at (2,2) and (3,1). From (7,2), moving LEFT gets me closer to x=2. Moving DOWN gets me closer to y=1.\nThe apple at (6,1) is the closest. To get there, moving LEFT (to 6,2) then DOWN (to 6,1) is a 2-turn path. Moving DOWN (to 7,1) then LEFT (to 6,1) is also a 2-turn path.\nHowever, moving LEFT (to 6,2) keeps me off the bottom edge. Moving DOWN (to 7,1) brings me closer to the bottom edge (y=0). Keeping options open is a rule.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the collision risk for the apple at (6,1).\nEnemy at (6,0). I am at (7,2).\nIf I move **LEFT** to (6,2):\nEnemy options:\n*   Up to (6,1): He eats the apple. I am at (6,2). I am safe.\n*   Right to (7,0): Safe.\n*   Left to (5,0): Safe.\n*   Down: Dies (wall).\nIf I move **DOWN** to (7,1):\nEnemy options:\n*   Up to (6,1): He eats the apple. I am at (7,1). Safe.\n*   Right to (7,0): He moves into my \"future path\" or just adjacent. I am at (7,1). He is at (7,0). Safe.\n*   Left to (5,0): Safe.\n\nBoth seem safe regarding immediate collision. However, moving **LEFT** to (6,2) positions me better to intercept the apple at (3,1) and (2,2) in the long run. Moving DOWN takes me towards the bottom right corner.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,0). If I move **LEFT** to (6,2), I am in the same column as the enemy. If the enemy moves **UP** to (6,1), he gets the apple. I am at (6,2). If I move **LEFT**, I am positioned to chase the apple at (2,2) or (3,1) or wait for the next apple at (6,1) if he misses it.\nActually, the apple at (6,1) is at (6,1). If I move **LEFT** to (6,2), I am adjacent to the apple. If I move **DOWN** to (7,1), I am also adjacent.\nThe enemy is at (6,0). If he moves UP, he eats (6,1). If he does that, I should look elsewhere.\nIf I move **LEFT**, I am at (6,2). I can move DOWN next to (6,1) if he misses, or LEFT to (5,2) to go for (3,1).\nIf I move **DOWN**, I am at (7,1). I can move LEFT to (6,1).\nThe apple at (2,2) is visible. The apple at (1,8) is high up.\nThe apples are clustered at (2,2), (3,1), (6,1).\nFrom (7,2), the vector to (2,2) is (-5, 0). From (7,1), the vector is (-5, 1). From (6,2), the vector is (-4, 0).\nMoving **LEFT** reduces the X distance to the cluster by 1. Moving DOWN increases the Y distance (initially) or keeps it similar.\nGiven the rule \"keep future options open\", moving LEFT moves me off the bottom edge (currently at y=2, so not critical) but towards the center of the board (x=6).\nActually, the board is 0-9. I am at 7. Center is around 4.5. Moving LEFT moves towards center. Moving DOWN moves towards edge (0). So LEFT is better.\n\nLet's check the text from the prompt.\n**START LAST RATIONALE** ... **LEFT** ... **END LAST RATIONALE**\nThe previous turn (Turn 0) the snake was at (8,2). It moved LEFT to (7,2). That was correct.\nNow, I am at (7,2).\nI should move **LEFT** again? Let's see.\nIf I move **LEFT** to (6,2), I am at X=6. This is where the apple at (6,1) is. This sets me up to potentially eat it or move towards (3,1).\nThe enemy is at (6,0). If he moves UP to (6,1), he eats it. If I am at (6,2), I am safe.\nIf I move **DOWN** to (7,1), I am next to the apple. If the enemy moves UP, I am safe. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (7,0), I am safe.\nIs there a reason to prefer one over the other?\nIf I move LEFT to (6,2), I am in a good position for the apple at (2,2) (west) and (3,1) (west-south).\nIf I move DOWN to (7,1), I am closer to (6,1) but further from (2,2).\nThe apple at (2,2) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance if I move LEFT (dist to 2,2 is 5) vs DOWN (dist to 2,2 is 6).\nAlso, moving LEFT puts me on X=6. The enemy is at X=6. If he moves UP, he gets the apple. If he dies or moves away, I can eat the next apple.\nWait, if I move **LEFT** to (6,2) and the enemy moves **UP** to (6,1), I am at (6,2). He is at (6,1). If on the *next* turn I move DOWN, I move into (6,1). He would have eaten the apple and grown. If he moves to (6,1) this turn, his tail is at (6,0). So (6,0) becomes empty. He grows.\nIf I move **DOWN** to (7,1), and he moves **UP** to (6,1), I am at (7,1). He is at (6,1). Next turn I can move LEFT to (6,1). But he would be there (if he stays) or he moved.\nActually, if he eats the apple at (6,1), he grows. So (6,0) becomes empty next turn.\nIf I move **LEFT** to (6,2), and he moves **UP** to (6,1), I am at (6,2) and he is at (6,1). We are adjacent. If he eats the apple, he grows into (6,0). If I move DOWN next turn, I move into (6,1). He would be at (6,1) (if he stayed) or moved.\nWait, if he moves UP to (6,1) and eats the apple, his body becomes: Head (6,1), Body (6,0). So the cell (6,0) is occupied by his tail.\nIf I move **LEFT** to (6,2) and he moves **UP** to (6,1):\nTurn 1:\nMe: (6,2)\nHim: (6,1)\nTurn 2:\nIf I move DOWN to (6,1) and he moves UP to (6,2):\nWe collide. Both die.\nIf he moves somewhere else, I get the apple (if there was one) or just move.\nThe apple at (6,1) is only there for 1 turn if he takes it.\n\nThe safe play is to move towards the cluster but stay safe.\nMoving **LEFT** to (6,2) puts me in the same column as the enemy. This is dangerous if he moves unpredictably.\nMoving **DOWN** to (7,1) keeps me in a different column.\nHowever, the prompt strategy says \"keep future options open\".\nIf I move **DOWN**, I am at (7,1). My options: UP (back), DOWN (7,0), LEFT (6,1), RIGHT (8,1).\nIf I move **LEFT**, I am at (6,2). My options: UP (6,3), DOWN (6,1), LEFT (5,2), RIGHT (7,2).\nAt (7,1), moving DOWN leads to (7,0). At (6,2), moving LEFT leads to (5,2) which is safer than (7,0).\nAlso, the apple at (6,1) is closer to me now than to the enemy (Manhattan distance: Me 2, Enemy 1). The enemy is closer.\nIf the enemy takes (6,1), I should pivot to (3,1) or (2,2).\nFrom (6,2), going for (2,2) or (3,1) is efficient.\nFrom (7,1), going for (2,2) or (3,1) is less efficient.\nSo, I will move **LEFT**.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move LEFT to position myself at (6,2). This places me on the X-axis of the apple cluster (6,1, 3,1, 2,2) and sets up a pivot towards the western apples if the enemy takes the eastern one.\n\nLEFT",

The apples are located at (1, 8), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), and (6, 1).\n\nI need to choose a move (UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT) from (7, 2).\n\n1.  **Analyze potential moves from (7, 2):**\n    *   **UP (7, 3):** Safe (no walls, no snakes). Moves away from the low Y apples (3, 1, 2, 2, 6, 1). Not optimal.\n    *   **DOWN (7, 1):** Safe. Moves closer to apple at (6, 1). I would be at (7, 1), enemy at (6, 0). If enemy moves UP to (6, 1), I am safe at (7, 1). If enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 0), I am safe. This is a valid move, but leaves me on the bottom edge (y=1) and further from the western apples (2, 2).\n    *   **LEFT (6, 2):** Safe. Moves closer to apple at (6, 1) (distance 2) and apple at (2, 2) (distance 4). This is the most central option.\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 2):** Safe. Moves away from the apple cluster. Bad option.\n\n2.  **Compare LEFT vs DOWN:**\n    *   **Positioning:** Moving **LEFT** to (6, 2) keeps the snake centrally located and moves it towards the cluster of apples at (2, 2) and (3, 1). Moving **DOWN** to (7, 1) moves it to the edge of the board and away from the western apples.\n    *   **Enemy Interaction:** The enemy is at (6, 0). If the enemy moves UP to (6, 1), the apple at (6, 1) is eaten. If I am at (6, 2) (via LEFT), I am safe and can pivot to (2, 2) next turn. If I am at (7, 1) (via DOWN), I am safe but my path to (2, 2) is longer.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (6, 2), I have access to (5, 2), (6, 3), etc., staying in the central area. From (7, 1), I am at risk of being cornered against the bottom edge if the enemy moves aggressively.\n\n    The move **LEFT** provides the best balance of approaching the nearest apple cluster and keeping future options open (avoiding edges).\n\n3.  **Safety Check for LEFT:**\n    *   My new head: (6, 2).\n    *   Enemy new head: Let's consider the worst case, enemy moves UP to (6, 1).\n    *   Result: Me at (6, 2), Enemy at (6, 1). No collision. I am safe.\n    *   If enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 0): Me at (6, 2), Enemy at (7, 0). Safe.\n    *   My body: None. Backwards would be (8, 2), which is not where I am going. Safe.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Moving LEFT is the best move to secure position towards the apple cluster at (2, 2) and (3, 1) while remaining safe.\n\nLEFT",

Be cautious of Snake #0 near the bottom edge.\n\nThe board state shown in the prompt description lists the head at (5, 2). However, the \"Last Move Information\" section indicates a previous move of LEFT from (7, 2). Let's compare:\n- **Description text**: Head at (5, 2).\n- **Grid visualization**: Shows `1` at `(5, 2)`.\n- **Last Move Rationale**: Explicitly states the previous head was at (7, 2) and moves LEFT to (6, 2).\n\nI will trust the grid visualization and description text over the hallucinated last move rationale. The \"START LAST MOVE PICK: LEFT\" is likely a fabrication by the model. I will assume my current position is **(5, 2)**, as indicated by the `(x, y)` coordinate system and the grid.\n\nCurrent Position: (5, 2)\nApples: (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 1), (1, 8), (6, 4)\nEnemy: Snake #0 at (5, 1), Body: [(6, 1), (6, 0)]\n\nAnalysis of moves from (5, 2):\n1.  **DOWN (5, 1)**: This is the cell occupied by Snake #0's head. If Snake #0 stays still or moves away, I might survive, but typically heads move. If Snake #0 moves UP or stays, we collide head-on (both die). If Snake #0 moves LEFT, it leaves (5, 1) empty, but that's risky. However, (5, 1) is currently occupied by a snake head. Moving into a cell occupied by an enemy head is a guaranteed head-on collision this turn (since the enemy head is already there and will remain or move, but you are moving *into* it). Actually, simultaneous movement rules say if two heads move into the same cell, both die. If I move to (5,1) and #0 is already there, I am moving *into* his head. He might move out, but I am still entering the cell he currently occupies. Strict avoidance of enemy heads is best. **Unsafe/High Risk.**\n\n2.  **LEFT (4, 2)**: Moves toward the apple cluster at (2, 2) and (3, 1). It is currently empty. Distance to (3, 1) becomes 2. Distance to (2, 2) becomes 2. Safe.\n\n3.  **RIGHT (6, 2)**: Moves toward the apple at (6, 4). It is currently empty. Distance to (6, 4) becomes 2. Safe.\n\n4.  **UP (5, 3)**: Moves away from the closest apples. It is currently empty. Safe, but less optimal for scoring immediately.\n\n**Comparison (Left vs Right):**\n- **Left (4,2)** leads to two apples: (3, 1) and (2, 2).\n- **Right (6, 2)** leads to one apple: (6, 4).\n- **Enemy Position**: Enemy #0 is at (5, 1), immediately below me. Moving DOWN is dangerous. Moving LEFT or RIGHT removes me from the column above the enemy, reducing immediate collision risk if the enemy moves UP.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **LEFT** is the best strategic choice to approach the dense apple cluster (2, 2) and (3, 1) while maintaining safety.\n\nPlan: Approach apple cluster at (2,2) and (3,1) by moving LEFT. Maintain distance from Snake #0 at (5,1).\n\nLEFT",

Body: `[(5, 1), (6, 1)]`.\n*   **Apple Cluster:** `(2, 2)` and `(3, 1)` are close.\n*   **Board Size:** 10x10 (0-9).\n*   **Turn:** 4/150.\n\n**Move Evaluation from `(4, 2)`:**\n\n1.  **DOWN (`(4, 1)`):**\n    *   **Occupancy:** Currently occupied by Snake #0's head.\n    *   **Risk:** High. This is a head-on collision path. If Snake #0 stays still or moves UP, we collide immediately. Even if Snake #0 moves, moving *into* a cell occupied by another head is extremely dangerous and usually results in a head-on collision if the enemy doesn't vacate it.\n    *   **Verdict:** **Unsafe.**\n\n2.  **UP (`(4, 3)`):**\n    *   **Occupancy:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. The nearest apple in that direction is `(6, 4)`. Moving up puts me on a path to `(5, 3)`, `(6, 3)`, `(6, 4)`.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moderate. It's a path to the apple at `(6, 4)`, but I have to bypass a potential conflict area near `(4, 1)` (Snake #0) without gaining immediate points.\n\n3.  **LEFT (`(3, 2)`):**\n    *   **Occupancy:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** High. This moves me directly towards the apple at `(2, 2)` and the apple at `(3, 1)`. From `(3, 2)`, I can easily reach `(2, 2)` next turn.\n    *   **Enemy Interaction:** This moves me away from Snake #0 at `(4, 1)`, reducing immediate collision risk.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (`(5, 2)`):**\n    *   **Occupancy:** Empty.\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moderate. This moves me towards the apple at `(6, 4)`. However, I am currently blocking Snake #0's potential path upwards (if he wanted to go UP, he would have to collide with me this turn, but he is at `(4, 1)`). Moving RIGHT allows me to flank Snake #0 if he moves UP.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **LEFT** is the best choice. It aligns me perfectly with the dense apple cluster at `(2, 2)` and `(3, 1)`. It is safe and minimizes immediate interaction with the enemy snake at `(4, 1)`. Moving UP is a viable alternative but is less direct for the closest apples.\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to approach the apple cluster at (2, 2) and (3, 1).

There is an apple at (2, 2) to my left and an apple at (3, 1) below me.\n\nI need to evaluate the four possible moves for this turn (Turn 5):\n\n1.  **UP (to (3, 3))**: This cell is currently empty. It moves me away from the enemy snake #0 and the immediate bottom edge. While there are no apples immediately adjacent in this direction, it keeps me safe and central. It is a valid safe move.\n2.  **DOWN (to (3, 1))**: This cell is occupied by the head of snake #0. Moving here would result in a head-on collision. Both snakes would die. Since I cannot win if I am dead, this move is fatal.\n3.  **LEFT (to (2, 2))**: This cell contains an apple ('A'). Moving here would allow me to eat the apple, grow, and score a point. I must check if the cell is safe from collision. I will be the only occupant of (2, 2) because snake #0 is at (3, 1) and (4, 1). To move LEFT to (2, 2), snake #0 would have to move UP to (3, 2) (my current position), LEFT to (2, 1), or DOWN (illegal). None of these moves land on (2, 2). Therefore, moving LEFT is safe, scores a point, and grows my snake.\n4.  **RIGHT (to (4, 2))**: This cell is empty. This moves me away from the apple at (2, 2) but keeps me relatively safe.\n\nComparing the safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT):\n- **LEFT** allows me to eat an apple immediately, increasing my score. The destination is safe from collision. This is the most aggressive and beneficial move.\n- **UP** and **RIGHT** are safe but do not yield immediate points.\n\nStrategy: Eat the apple at (2, 2) to gain a point and grow.

Note: The apple at (2, 4) was eaten by me on the previous turn (Turn 7), so it is no longer there (implied by board update).\n\n**Objective:**\nSurvive, gain apples, and close the score gap. I am trailing 2-3.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1.  **UP (to (2, 5)):**\n    *   **Safety:** The cell (2, 5) is currently empty.\n    *   **Collision Check:**\n        *   **Self:** My body is at (2, 3) and (2, 2). (2, 5) is free. Not backwards.\n        *   **Enemy:** Snake #0 is at (1, 2). Its immediate options are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n            *   If Enemy goes UP to (1, 3), safe.\n            *   If Enemy goes RIGHT to (2, 2), safe (hits my tail, grows).\n            *   If Enemy goes DOWN to (1, 1), safe.\n            *   If Enemy goes LEFT to (0, 2), safe.\n            *   Enemy cannot reach (2, 5) this turn.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves towards apples at (1, 8) and (2, 9). This direction offers a clear path North. However, moving UP aligns me vertically with the enemy. If the enemy continues to move Right/Up and I move Up, we might compete for space in the upper half later.\n\n2.  **RIGHT (to (3, 4)):**\n    *   **Safety:** The cell (3, 4) is empty.\n    *   **Collision Check:**\n        *   **Self:** Safe.\n        *   **Enemy:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves towards the apple at (6, 4). This is the closest horizontal apple. This move opens up the option to go UP towards the (9, 7) cluster later or continue East to the (6, 4) apple. It also moves me away from the enemy's current vertical alignment, potentially reducing immediate conflict for the Northern apples.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to (1, 4)):**\n    *   **Safety:** The cell (1, 4) is empty.\n    *   **Collision Check:**\n        *   **Self:** Safe.\n        *   **Enemy:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves towards (1, 8). However, this keeps me close to the enemy's potential expansion route (if they go Up).\n\n4.  **DOWN (to (2, 3)):**\n    *   **Collision:** My body is at (2, 3). Moving **DOWN** into (2, 3) means hitting my own body. **DEADLY.**\n\n**Decision:**\nI will eliminate **DOWN** as it is fatal.\n\nComparing the remaining safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT):\n*   **UP** moves towards the cluster of apples at (1, 8) and (2, 9). It is a strong move but brings me closer to the enemy vertically.\n*   **LEFT** also moves towards (1, 8), but is less efficient than UP (diagonal path) and keeps me closer to the enemy's current position.\n*   **RIGHT** moves towards the apple at (6, 4). This is a distinct, valuable apple that is further away from the enemy's current position. It also allows for a future transition to the Northern apples (9, 6) and (9, 7) if I move UP later.\n\n**RIGHT** is chosen because it secures a path to the central apple at (6, 4) while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy. It offers good future options without immediately cornering me.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nHead East towards the apple at (6, 4). From there, I will likely turn North towards the cluster at (9, 6), (9, 7). I need to ensure I do not get trapped by the enemy or walls.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving **LEFT** into (4, 4) hits my own body. **DEADLY.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to (6, 4)):**\n    *   **Safety:** Contains an apple.\n    *   **Collision Check:**\n        *   **Self:** Safe (my body is at 5,4; 4,4; 3,4).\n        *   **Enemy:** Safe (Enemy is at 1,5).\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves onto the apple. This will grow my snake, increase my score to 3, and potentially block the enemy or clear the board for future moves.\n\n**Decision:**\nI eliminate **LEFT** as it results in immediate death. **UP** and **DOWN** move away from the immediate objective. **RIGHT** secures the apple at (6, 4), which is the most direct way to increase my score and catch up to the enemy. Eating the apple is the priority.\n\n**RIGHT**\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter eating the apple at (6, 4), I will likely need to navigate around the new body segment or move towards the Northern cluster (9, 6), (9, 7) or (2, 9). I will assess the safest path North or West after this move.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, looking at the *Previous Last Move Rationale*, it said Snake #0 moved to (1, 8). The current board state shows Snake #0 head at (2, 8). This implies Snake #0 moved RIGHT from (1, 8) to (2, 8) on turn 14.\n    *   Wait, let's re-read the *Previous Last Move Rationale* carefully: \"Enemy Snake #0: Head at (1, 8). ... Snake has moved to (1, 8)\". This is the state *before* Turn 14. The *Current Board State* shows `0` at (2, 8). So Snake #0 moved RIGHT.\n    *   Actually, looking at the provided \"Board State\" in the prompt for Turn 15: Row 8 shows `. T 0 ...`. This corresponds to coordinates (0,8) to (9,8). `T` is at x=1, `0` is at x=2. So Snake #0 is at (2, 8). Correct.\n*   **Apples:** (9, 7), (9, 6), (2, 9), (8, 3), (9, 2). (Apple at (7, 6) was eaten).\n*   **Board Context:** My head is at (7, 6). I just ate the apple at (7, 6). I am adjacent to the Northern cluster (9,6), (9,7). The enemy snake is at (2, 8), moving towards the apple at (2, 9).\n\n**Move Evaluation (checking immediate collision):**\n1.  **UP (to (7, 7)):**\n    *   **Safety:** The board state shows `.` at (7, 7) (Row 7, Col 7). Row 7 has `A` at (9, 7).\n    *   **Collision Check:** Safe. (Body is at (6, 6), (6, 5)... not (7, 7)).\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves towards the apples at (9, 7) and (9, 6). Good.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to (7, 5)):**\n    *   **Safety:** The board state shows `.` at (7, 5).\n    *   **Collision Check:** Safe. (Body is at (6, 5), but (7, 5) is empty).\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves away from the Northern apples. Less optimal than UP.\n\n3.  **LEFT (to (6, 6)):**\n    *   **Safety:** My body is at (6, 6).\n    *   **Collision Check:** **DEADLY.** Moving into my own body.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to (8, 6)):**\n    *   **Safety:** The board state shows `A` at (9, 6) (Row 6). (8, 6) is currently empty `.`.\n    *   **Collision Check:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Moves closer to the apple at (9, 6). However, moving UP to (7, 7) also approaches the cluster.\n\n**Comparison of UP and RIGHT:**\n*   **UP (7, 7):** Moves into the column x=7. Next turn, I can move UP to (7, 8), then RIGHT to (9, 8), then DOWN to (9, 7) or (9, 6).\n*   **RIGHT (8, 6):** Moves into the column x=8. Next turn, I can move UP to (8, 7), then RIGHT to (9, 7). This is a more direct path to (9, 7).\n\n**Enemy Prediction:**\nEnemy at (2, 8) with apple at (2, 9) and (9, 2).\n*   Likely move: UP to (2, 9) to eat the apple.\n*   Unlikely to interact with me at x=7 or x=8.\n\n**Decision:**\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe. Moving **UP** to (7, 7) seems slightly better because it keeps my options open. If I go UP, I can eventually go RIGHT to (9, 7) or (9, 6).\nHowever, looking at the coordinates:\nCurrent: (7, 6).\nTarget: (9, 7) (Manhattan distance 3) or (9, 6) (Manhattan distance 2).\nPathing:\nOption UP: (7, 6) -> (7, 7) -> (8, 7) -> (9, 7). (3 moves).\nOption RIGHT: (7, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (9, 6). (2 moves).\nOption RIGHT is a much faster path to (9, 6).\nOption RIGHT: (7, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (8, 7) -> (9, 7). (3 moves).\nSo RIGHT offers a faster route to (9, 6) and a comparable route to (9, 7).\n\nWait, if I move UP to (7, 7), I am closer to (8, 7).\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 6), I am closer to (9, 6).\nThe apple at (9, 6) is \"below\" the apple at (9, 7).\nAlso, there is an apple at (8, 3).\nMy body extends down to (5, 4). If I go RIGHT to (8, 6), I can eventually spiral down to (8, 3).\nHowever, the apples at (9, 7) and (9, 6) are closer.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nRow 6: `. T . . . . T 1 . A`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n(8, 6) is currently empty.\n(7, 7) is currently empty.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 6):\nI am at (8, 6). Next turn I can go UP to (8, 7) or RIGHT to (9, 6).\nIf I move UP to (7, 7):\nI am at (7, 7). Next turn I can go UP to (7, 8) or RIGHT to (8, 7).\n\nMoving **RIGHT** seems to be a direct step towards the apple at (9, 6). Let's verify safety for NEXT turn if I go RIGHT.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 6):\nMy body becomes: [(8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)].\nThe cell (7, 6) is the old head.\nNext turn, if I go UP to (8, 7): Safe?\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 6): Safe? (There is an apple at 9,6).\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 6): Safe? (Old body part). Yes, that's safe, but leaves the apple.\n\nMoving UP to (7, 7):\nMy body becomes: [(7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)].\nNext turn:\nUP to (7, 8): Safe?\nRIGHT to (8, 7): Safe?\nDOWN to (7, 6): Safe? (Old body). Yes.\nLEFT to (6, 7): Safe?\n\nBoth seem safe.\nLet's look at the enemy. Head at (2, 8). Body at (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5).\nIf the enemy moves UP to (2, 9) to eat the apple, they will be at (2, 9).\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (3, 8), they are just moving.\nThere is no threat to me at x=7 or x=8.\n\nWhy prefer RIGHT over UP?\nRight moves me to x=8. Up moves me to y=7.\nApple (9, 6) is at x=9, y=6.\nApple (9, 7) is at x=9, y=7.\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 6), I am equidistant to both (distance 1 to (9,6) and distance sqrt(2) to (9,7)).\nIf I go UP to (7, 7), I am distance 2 to (9,6) and distance 2 to (9,7).\nActually, from (8, 6):\n- To (9, 6): 1 move (RIGHT).\n- To (9, 7): 2 moves (UP then RIGHT).\nFrom (7, 7):\n- To (9, 7): 2 moves (RIGHT then RIGHT).\n- To (9, 6): 2 moves (RIGHT then DOWN) or (DOWN then RIGHT).\nDistance is equal. However, (8, 6) is closer to (9, 6). (9, 6) is one of the two apples in the cluster.\nAlso, consider the apple at (8, 3).\nFrom (8, 6), (8, 3) is 3 moves DOWN.\nFrom (7, 7), (8, 3) is 4 moves (DOWN then RIGHT...).\n\nSo, **RIGHT** seems slightly better for reaching the nearest target (9, 6) and the southern target (8, 3).\n\nWait, let's check if (8, 7) is safe next turn.\nBoard state Row 7: `. T . . . . . . . A`. (0 to 9).\n(8, 7) is `.`.\nBoard state Row 8: `. T 0 . . . . . . .`.\n(8, 8) is `.`.\nSeems safe.\n\nOne final check. Is there any trap?\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 6). The cell (8, 6) is currently empty.\nIs there a snake at (9, 6)? No, there is an apple.\nIs there a snake at (9, 5)? Row 5: `. T . . . . T . . .`. (9, 5) is `.`.\nIs there a snake at (8, 5)? Row 5: (8, 5) is `.`.\nIs there a snake at (7, 6)? Yes, that's my old head. But I am moving *into* (8, 6), so I won't collide with (7, 6) on this turn.\nIs there a snake at (9, 6) moving into (8, 6)? No, no enemy snakes are near.\n\nSo, RIGHT is safe and progress toward the cluster.\n\nOne alternative consideration:\nThe apple at (2, 9) is likely to be eaten by Snake #0. Let's assume Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 9).\nThe apple at (9, 2) is far south.\nThe apple at (8, 3) is south.\nThe apples at (9, 6) and (9, 7) are the best targets.\n\nLet's write the plan.\nPlan: Move RIGHT to (8, 6) to close the distance to the apples at (9, 6) and (9, 7). Next turn, target (9, 6) or (9, 7). Keep an eye on the enemy at (2, 8).\n\nWait, the instructions say: \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nI will write the plan, then the move.\n\nDouble check coordinates.\nY axis: 0 is bottom. 9 is top.\nBoard:\nRow 9: `9 . . A . . . . . . .`\nRow 8: `8 . T 0 . . . . . . .`\nRow 7: `7 . T . . . . . . . A`\nRow 6: `6 . T . . . . T 1 . A`\nCurrent head: `1` at (7, 6).\nRight of head (8, 6) is empty `.`\nUp of head (7, 7) is empty `.`\nDown of head (7, 5) is empty `.`\nLeft of head (6, 6) is `T` (my body).\n\nSo, Left is death.\nUp, Down, Right are safe.\nRight gets me closer to (9, 6).\nUp gets me closer to (9, 7).\nWhich is better?\n(9, 6) and (9, 7) are right next to each other.\nI can get (9, 6) first, then (9, 7).\nOr (9, 7) first, then (9, 6).\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 6):\nI can go RIGHT to (9, 6) immediately next turn.\nIf I go UP to (7, 7):\nI can go RIGHT to (8, 7), then RIGHT to (9, 7).\nTo get (9, 6) from (7, 7): UP to (7, 8), RIGHT to (9, 8), DOWN to (9, 7), DOWN to (9, 6). This is a longer path.\nSo, RIGHT is strictly better for the (9, 6) apple, and equal or better for the (9, 7) apple in the long run.\n\nAlso, what if the enemy moves RIGHT?\nEnemy at (2, 8). Moving RIGHT goes to (3, 8).\nThis is nowhere near me. I am at x=7.\n\nWhat if there is a hidden danger?\nBoard is 10x10.\nI am at (7, 6).\nMy tail is at (5, 4).\nIf I eat an apple, I grow. So the tail doesn't move this turn.\nNext turn, the tail moves closer to the head (unless I eat again).\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 6):\nHead moves to (8, 6).\nBody becomes: (8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4).\nThis is valid.\n\nIs there a risk of being cornered?\n(8, 6) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 5) or (9, 7).\n(9, 6) is an apple. Eating it gives space.\nIf I am at (9, 6), I can go DOWN to (9, 5) or UP to (9, 7) or LEFT to (8, 6).\n(9, 5) is empty `.`\n(9, 7) is apple.\n(8, 6) will be my body.\nSo at (9, 6), I can go UP to (9, 7).\nAt (9, 7), I can go UP to (9, 8) or LEFT to (8, 7).\n(9, 8) is empty `.`.\n(8, 7) is empty `.`.\nSo I have exits.\n\nIf I go UP to (7, 7) first:\n(7, 7) -> (7, 8).\n(7, 8) -> (8, 8) or (7, 9) or (6, 8).\n(7, 9) is empty `.`\n(8, 8) is empty `.`\nAlso safe.\n\nBoth paths seem fine. RIGHT is just faster to the first apple.\n\nOne detail: The enemy snake is ID 0. Apples: 4. I have 4 apples.\nTie breaker: Most apples wins.\nI need to eat. The closest apples are (9, 6) and (9, 7).\nLet's grab (9, 6).\n\nFinal check on \"moving directly backwards\".\nMy current head is (7, 6).\nMy previous head was (6, 6).\nThe vector from previous to current is (1, 0) (RIGHT).\nThe vector for DOWN is (0, -1). This is NOT backwards.\nThe vector for LEFT is (-1, 0). This IS backwards. (Left is (6, 6)). That's blocked by body.\nSo I correctly identified LEFT as death.\n\nDecision is RIGHT.\n\nPlan: Pursue the northern apple cluster at (9, 6) and (9, 7). Moving RIGHT now to minimize distance to (9, 6).\n\nWait, I need to format the output.\nThe prompt says: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note... Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nSo:\nPlan: ...\nRIGHT\n\nWait, the prompt says: \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nIf I write a plan, it should be a separate paragraph or line?\n\"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nSo:\n[Plan text]\n[Move]\n\nExample:\n\"Plan: Secure the apple at (9, 6).\nRIGHT\"\n\nI will do that.\n\nOne final check on the enemy.\nEnemy head at (2, 8). Body parts at (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5).\nApple at (2, 9). Distance 1 (UP).\nApple at (9, 2). Distance is large.\nThe enemy will almost certainly move UP to (2, 9).\nThis means on the next turn, the enemy body will extend to (2, 8) (old head) and (1, 8) (old body).\nThe cell (2, 8) will be occupied by the enemy body (tail).\nThe cell (1, 8) will be occupied by the enemy body.\nThe cell (2, 7) is currently empty, but will likely be empty next turn unless the enemy moves down, which is unlikely.\nThis is far away from me (x=2 vs x=8).\n\nSo, I am safe to move RIGHT.\n\nAnother check:\nWhat if Snake #0 moves LEFT instead of UP?\nSnake #0 at (2, 8). Left is (1, 8), which is occupied by its own body (since it just moved there from (1, 8)? No, wait.\nThe state shows:\nSnake #0 Head: (2, 8).\nBody: [(1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5)].\nSo the neck is (1, 8).\nMoving LEFT would be into (1, 8), which is its own body.\nSo Snake #0 cannot move LEFT.\nSnake #0 can move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\nDOWN to (2, 7). RIGHT to (3, 8).\nIf it moves DOWN, it moves away from the apple.\nIf it moves RIGHT, it moves away from the apple.\nIf it moves UP, it eats the apple.\nMost likely UP.\nIf it moves UP, it is at (2, 9).\nNext turn, its tail will move to (1, 7).\nSo (1, 8) will be empty.\n(2, 8) will be its body.\nNo interaction with me.\n\nSo, I stick to RIGHT.\n\nPlan:\nI am at (7, 6). I want to reach the apples at (9, 6) and (9, 7).\nMoving RIGHT to (8, 6) is the shortest path to (9, 6).\nFrom (8, 6), I can go RIGHT to (9, 6) next turn.\nI will also watch out for the enemy snake, but they are currently at (2, 8) and likely eating at (2, 9).\n\nMove: RIGHT.\n\nOutput format:\n[Plan text]\nRIGHT\n\nI will write a concise plan.\n\nOne tiny thought: What if the enemy moves UP to (2, 9) and eats the apple, growing to length 5.\nDoes this change anything?\nNo, they are still far away.\n\nIs there any risk of head-on collision at (8, 6)? No.\nIs there any risk of head-on collision at (9, 6)? No. Enemy is at x=2.\n\nOkay, go ahead.\n\nWait, checking the \"Rules\" again.\n\"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\"\nI am moving to (8, 6).\nIs there any snake that could move to (8, 6)?\nEnemy at (2, 8).

Apples are at: (8, 3), (9, 2), (3, 4), (0, 1), (5, 4).\nWait, the prompt says I am at (9, 7) in the \"Your snake (ID: 1)\" section. But the \"My last move information\" says I moved UP from (9,6). There is a slight contradiction in the prompt data vs the \"last move\" text, but usually the \"last move\" text defines the *transition* I just made. If I moved UP from (9,6), I am at (9,7). The \"Your snake\" section shows \"Head: (9,7)\". This matches.\n\nSo, I am at (9,7).\nI cannot go DOWN (backwards into (9,6)).\nI cannot go RIGHT (off board).\nI cannot go UP (off board).\nI MUST go LEFT to (8,7).\n\nIs (8,7) safe?\nRow 7: `. T . . . . . . . A` (from previous board state).\nIn the previous board state: Row 7: `. T . . . . . . . A`.\nThis means (1,7) is 'T'. (9,7) is 'A'.\n(8,7) is empty.\nSo LEFT is safe.\n\nMy plan was to go to (9,2). To do that, after going LEFT to (8,7), I will likely need to go DOWN.\n\nLet's write the plan for the next turn.\nSTART PLAN\nI am forced to move LEFT to (8,7) because DOWN is backwards and RIGHT/UP are off board. From (8,7), I will look to move DOWN to (8,6), but I must check if (8,6) is occupied by my tail. If I move LEFT now, my tail will shift. The ultimate goal is the apple at (9,2).\nEND PLAN\n\nAnd the move.\nSTART LAST MOVE PICK\nLEFT\nEND LAST MOVE PICK\n\nOne final check. Is there any possibility of an enemy snake hitting me?\nSnake #0 is at (3,8) head. Body at (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7).\nThey are far away.\nCollision check: No head-on collision possible at (8,7).\n\nThe move is LEFT.\n\nFINAL OUTPUT:\nSTART PLAN\nI am at (9,7) and must turn LEFT to (8,7) because moving DOWN would be backwards into my own body and other directions are off the board. Once at (8,7), I plan to navigate towards the apple at (9,2), likely by moving DOWN and potentially LEFT to open space.\nEND PLAN\n\nSTART LAST MOVE PICK\nLEFT\nEND LAST MOVE PICK\n\nSTART LAST RATIONALE\nI am at (9,7). The cell directly behind me is (9,6), which is part of my body. Moving DOWN would be moving backwards, which is fatal. Moving RIGHT or UP moves off the board. The only valid and safe move is LEFT to (8,7). I will take this move to stay alive and reposition.\nEND LAST RATIONALE\n\nLEFT",

Moving here is moving directly backwards into my own body, which is fatal.\n\nSo I must avoid RIGHT.\n\nOptions:\n1. **UP (6, 8)**: Moves me into row 8. The enemy snake has a body segment at (6, 9). The enemy head is at (3, 5). If the enemy moves UP, it stays in the left column. However, moving UP brings me closer to the top edge and the enemy's tail area. From (6, 8), my next moves would be restricted by the wall and potential body blocks.\n2. **DOWN (6, 6)**: Moves me into row 6. This opens up the path towards the bottom-left apples ((5, 4), (3, 4)) and the apple at (0, 1).\n3. **LEFT (5, 7)**: Similar to DOWN, moves towards the center-left area.\n\nLet's evaluate safety and future options.\n**LEFT** to (5, 7): Moves towards the center. From (5, 7), I can access (5, 6) or (5, 8).\n**DOWN** to (6, 6): Moves towards the lower center. From (6, 6), I can access (5, 6) or (6, 5).\n\nThe apple at (5, 4) is a prime target. It is currently unblocked. Moving **DOWN** to (6, 6) positions me directly above (6, 5) and adjacent to (5, 6), both of which are steps towards (5, 4).\nMoving **LEFT** to (5, 7) also works.\n\nLet's consider the enemy snake. Head at (3, 5). It has 5 apples. It might be targeting (3, 4) or (5, 4).\nIf I move **DOWN** to (6, 6), I am at y=6. The enemy is at y=5. If the enemy moves DOWN to (3, 4), it might eat an apple. If it moves RIGHT, it approaches the center.\nMoving **DOWN** seems to be the most direct path to the cluster of apples at y=4.\n\nLet's check for immediate dangers.\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 6):\n- The cell is empty.\n- My tail moves from (8, 6) to (7, 6).\n- My body will be: (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (8,6).\n- Safe.\n\nIf I move UP to (6, 8):\n- The cell is empty.\n- However, (6, 9) is a body part of the enemy. If the enemy moves DOWN, (6, 9) becomes empty, but (6, 8) becomes occupied by the enemy's tail (assuming they don't grow). But if the enemy grows, the tail doesn't move. This is risky.\n- Also, the edge at x=9 and y=9 is occupied. The top rows are getting crowded.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 7):\n- Safe.\n- Good position to descend to (5, 6) or (5, 5).\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT, DOWN positions me closer to the apple at (5, 4) and the general y=4 row where apples are located.\nTarget: (5, 4).\n\nMove: DOWN.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN towards the apples at y=4. Watch out for the enemy snake potentially moving into the center.\n\nDOWN",

My body occupies (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), and (8, 6).\nI am calculating the safety of the four possible moves:\n- **LEFT to (5, 6)**: (5, 6) is currently empty. My tail will move from (8, 6) to (7, 6). My body will be at (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6). No collision.\n- **UP to (6, 7)**: This is my current body segment immediately behind my head. This is moving backwards and is fatal.\n- **DOWN to (6, 5)**: (6, 5) is empty. My tail moves to (7, 6). Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (7, 6)**: (7, 6) is empty. My tail moves to (7, 6)? No, wait. If I move to (7, 6), my body follows. Current body: (6, 6), (6, 7)... Wait, my head is (6, 6). Current body is (6, 7), (7, 7)... (8, 6). So (7, 6) is currently empty. If I move Right, head becomes (7, 6). The rest of the body shifts. The tail at (8, 6) moves to (7, 6)? No, the tail moves to where the second to last segment was. Second to last is (9, 6). So the tail moves to (9, 6)? No. Let's trace: Head (6, 6) -> (7, 6). Segment 2 (6, 7) stays? No, all segments shift. Segment 2 moves to (6, 6). Segment 3 (7, 7) moves to (6, 7). ... Segment 6 (8, 6) moves to (9, 6)? No.\nLet's look at the body list: [(6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6)].\nMoving Right to (7, 6):\nNew Head: (7, 6)\nNew Body starts with old head (6, 6).\nNew Body: [(6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6)].\nOld tail (8, 6) is gone.\nIs (7, 6) currently occupied? By the body? No. By an apple? No.\nIs there a collision? No.\nSo RIGHT is actually safe.\n\nOkay, let's re-evaluate the blocked moves.\nThe only definitely blocked move is UP.\nLEFT, DOWN, and RIGHT are all valid options.\n\nWhere are the apples? (8, 3), (9, 2), (0, 1), (5, 4), (3, 0).\nMy current y=6. The closest apple is (5, 4) or (3, 0).\nTo get to (5, 4), I need to go Left and Down.\nTo get to (3, 0), I need to go Left and Down.\nTo get to (8, 3) or (9, 2), I need to go Right and Down.\n\nLet's analyze the board state from (6, 6).\n- **LEFT (5, 6)**: Opens up Left/Down paths. Seems safe.\n- **DOWN (6, 5)**: Moves towards the bottom. Safe.\n- **RIGHT (7, 6)**: Moves towards the right side. The right side (x=7,8,9) seems crowded by my own body (at y=7) and the edge. Also, apples at (8,3) and (9,2) are there.\n\nConsider the enemy at (3, 4).\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 6), I am approaching the center.\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 5), I am moving away from the enemy (vertical distance).\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 6), I am moving towards my own body tail area? No, my tail is at (8, 6) currently. Moving Right puts me at (7, 6), which is to the left of my tail? No, (8, 6) is to the right of (7, 6). Wait. My tail is at (8, 6). Moving Right to (7, 6) is actually moving AWAY from my tail (which is at x=8)? No. My head is at x=6. Tail is at x=8. Moving Right increases x to 7. So I move closer to my tail? No. Wait.\nHead: (6, 6).\nTail: (8, 6).\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 6), I am moving closer to the tail (8,6).\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 6), I am moving away from the tail.\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 5), I am moving away from the tail.\n\nMoving RIGHT towards my own tail is usually a bad idea in the long run unless I am about to eat an apple. There are no apples at (7, 6) or (8, 6).\nSo RIGHT is likely a bad long-term choice.\n\nBetween LEFT and DOWN:\nLEFT (5, 6) moves towards the horizontal center, giving access to (4, 6), (5, 5), etc. This connects to (5, 4).\nDOWN (6, 5) moves vertically down. (6, 5) is open. (6, 4) is open. (6, 3) is open. (6, 2) is open. (6, 1) is empty? No, (6, 1) is empty but (5, 1) is an apple? No, apple is at (0, 1). (3, 0) is an apple.\nFrom (6, 5), I can go to (5, 5) to reach (5, 4).\nFrom (6, 6), I can go LEFT to (5, 6) then DOWN to (5, 5) then DOWN to (5, 4).\nOr I can go DOWN to (6, 5) then LEFT to (5, 5) then DOWN to (5, 4).\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN seem reasonable.\nHowever, looking at the board:\nRow 6 is: `. . . T . . 1 . T T`\nCurrent x=6 (where the 1 is).\nTo the Left (x=5) is empty.\nTo the Right (x=7) is empty.\nTo the Down (y=5) at x=6 is empty.\nTo the Up (y=7) at x=6 is body.\n\nLet's look at the \"survival\" aspect.\nI am at (6, 6).\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 5):\nMy body moves. The tail (8, 6) moves to (7, 6).\nNew body includes (6, 6), (6, 7)...\nWait, if I move DOWN, my head becomes (6, 5). Old head (6, 6) becomes neck.\nIf I move LEFT, my head becomes (5, 6). Old head (6, 6) becomes neck.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (3, 4).\nIf I move DOWN, I increase distance from enemy.\nIf I move LEFT, I stay same distance or decrease slightly.\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\n(5, 4) is close.\n(3, 0) is far.\n(8, 3) and (9, 2) are right-ish.\n\nThe board grid shows:\nRow 6: `. . . T . . 1 . T T`\nRow 5: `. . . T . . . . . .`\nRow 4: `. . . 0 . A . . . .`\nRow 3: `. . . . . . . . A .`\n\nAt Row 6, x=6 is my head.\nx=5 is empty.\nx=7 is empty.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 5):\nI am at (6, 5).\nThis allows me to access (5, 5) next turn.\nFrom (5, 5), I can get to (5, 4).\n(5, 4) has an apple.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 6):\nI am at (5, 6).\nI can go DOWN to (5, 5) next turn.\nFrom (5, 5) to (5, 4).\n\nBoth seem to be good paths.\nIs there any immediate threat?\nThe enemy snake is at (3, 4). He might be going for (5, 4) or the apple at (0, 1).\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT, he goes to (4, 4).\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 5), I am safe.\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 6), I am safe.\n\nLet's check \"future options\".\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 5):\nMy body occupies (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6).\nWait, the tail moves. Old tail (8, 6) moves to (7, 6).\nSo body is: (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (7, 6)?\nLet's trace carefully.\nHead: (6, 6).\nBody: (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6).\nMove DOWN: Head -> (6, 5).\nNew Body: Old Head (6, 6), then (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6).\nTail (8, 6) is dropped.\nSo new body: (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6).\nCurrent positions: Head (6, 5), Body (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6).\nThis looks like a solid block on the right side of the board, and a vertical line at x=6.\nFrom (6, 5), I can go LEFT to (5, 5), DOWN to (6, 4), or RIGHT to (7, 5).\n(7, 5) is currently empty.\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 5), my body would shift. (6, 5) becomes body. (6, 6) becomes body... The tail (9, 6) drops.\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 5), I am approaching the center.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 6):\nHead -> (5, 6).\nBody: Old Head (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6).\nTail (8, 6) drops.\nNew Body: (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6).\nCurrent positions: Head (5, 6), Body (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6).\nFrom (5, 6), I can go LEFT to (4, 6), DOWN to (5, 5), UP to (5, 7).\n(5, 7) is empty? No, (5, 7) is empty in the grid.\nWait, row 7 is `. . . T . . T T T T`.\n(5, 7) is empty.\nSo from (5, 6), I have 3 safe directions (Left, Down, Up).\nFrom (6, 5), I have 3 safe directions (Left, Down, Right).\n\nThe apple at (5, 4) is the closest.\n(5, 4) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 6) OR (6, 5) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 4).\nSo both paths work.\n\nHowever, the board has an apple at (3, 0).\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 5), I am getting further from (3, 0).\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 6), I am roughly the same distance.\n\nLet's look at the enemy again. Head (3, 4).\nIf the enemy wants (5, 4), it will likely move RIGHT.\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 5), I am not competing for (5, 4) immediately.\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 6), I am setting up to compete for (5, 4).\nMaybe it's better to go DOWN to (6, 5) to avoid conflict?\n\nWait, let's look at the apple at (8, 3) and (9, 2).\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 5), I am at y=5.\nTo get to (8, 3), I would go RIGHT then DOWN.\nTo get to (5, 4), I would go LEFT then DOWN.\nFrom (6, 5), both are accessible.\n\nLet's look at the \"trap\" potential.\nCurrent body is bulky on the right.\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 6), I am squeezing myself between my body and the edge?\nHead (7, 6).\nBody follows. Old head (6, 6).\nBody will be: (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6).\nThe space at (7, 5) is open. (8, 5) is open.\nBut (9, 5) is blocked by the wall? No, x=9 is max. (9, 5) is inside.\nWait, (9, 6) is body. (9, 7) is body.\nIf I am at (7, 6), I can go DOWN to (7, 5).\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 5), then I might be able to go RIGHT to (8, 5).\nFrom (8, 5) to (8, 4) to (8, 3) (apple).\nSo RIGHT is a valid path to the right-side apples.\n\nBut earlier I said moving RIGHT is bad because it moves towards the tail?\nLet's re-read. \"Moving RIGHT towards my own tail\".\nHead (6, 6). Tail (8, 6). X=8 > X=6. So tail is to the RIGHT.\nMoving RIGHT increases X. So yes, I move towards tail.\nWhy is this bad?\nBecause the tail is part of the body. If I get too close, I might trap myself.\nHowever, the tail might move away next turn (it will move left to 7, 6 if I move right to 7, 6? No, the tail follows the body).\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 6), my body shifts. The tail (8, 6) drops. The new tail is (9, 6).\nWait.\nHead (6, 6) -> (7, 6).\nBody: (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6).\nTail is (9, 6).\nSo moving RIGHT actually puts me at x=7 and the tail at x=9.\nDistance is 2.\nI am NOT moving into the tail. The tail moves away (to the right) as the body shifts? No, the tail drops off the end.\nThe \"tail\" is the last element of the list. It gets removed.\nSo I am safe from hitting my tail immediately.\nThe risk is running into the body segments that will be there after the shift.\nNew body includes (6, 6) and (6, 7).\n(7, 6) is safe.\n(7, 7) is body.\n(6, 6) is body.\n(6, 5) is empty.\nSo from (7, 6), I can go DOWN (7, 5), LEFT (6, 6) which is body (bad), UP (7, 7) which is body (bad).\nSo from (7, 6), my only safe move next turn would be DOWN (to 7, 5) or RIGHT (to 8, 6)?\nWait, (8, 6) was the old tail. It drops. So (8, 6) becomes empty?\nOld body: (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6).\nNew body: (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6).\nSo (8, 6) is empty.\nFrom (7, 6):\n- DOWN to (7, 5): Safe.\n- UP to (7, 7): Body (hit).\n- LEFT to (6, 6): Body (hit).\n- RIGHT to (8, 6): Empty. Safe.\nSo from (7, 6), I have 2 options: DOWN and RIGHT.\nFrom (5, 6) (LEFT move):\n- DOWN (5, 5): Safe.\n- UP (5, 7): Safe.\n- LEFT (4, 6): Safe.\n- RIGHT (6, 6): Body (hit).\n3 options.\nFrom (6, 5) (DOWN move):\n- LEFT (5, 5): Safe.\n- RIGHT (7, 5): Safe.\n- DOWN (6, 4): Safe.\n- UP (6, 6): Body (hit).\n3 options.\n\nSo LEFT and DOWN give 3 options. RIGHT gives 2.\nSo RIGHT is strictly worse in terms of flexibility.\n\nNow compare LEFT (5, 6) vs DOWN (6, 5).\nBoth give 3 options.\nLEFT (5, 6) puts me at X=5.\nDOWN (6, 5) puts me at Y=5.\n\nApple (5, 4) is at X=5, Y=4.\nTo get there from (5, 6): 2 moves (Down, Down).\nTo get there from (6, 5): 2 moves (Left, Down).\nSame distance.\n\nApple (3, 0) is at X=3, Y=0.\nFrom (5, 6): 5 moves (Left, Down...).\nFrom (6, 5): 6 moves (Left, Left...).\n(5, 6) is closer to (3, 0).\n\nApple (0, 1) is at X=0, Y=1.\n(5, 6) is closer.\n\nApple (8, 3) is at X=8, Y=3.\nFrom (5, 6): Distance is 3 + 3 = 6.\nFrom (6, 5): Distance is 2 + 2 = 4.\n(6, 5) is closer to the right-side apples.\n\nApple (9, 2) is at X=9, Y=2.\nFrom (6, 5): Distance 3 + 3 = 6.\nFrom (5, 6): Distance 4 + 4 = 8.\n(6, 5) is closer.\n\nEnemy snake is at (3, 4).\nEnemy is close to (5, 4).\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 6), I am on the same X column as the apple (5, 4) and the enemy (3, 4).\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 5), I am on a different X column (6).\nThe enemy might go for (5, 4). If he does, and I also go for (5, 4), we might collide.\nThe enemy is at (3, 4). To get to (5, 4), he needs to move Right, Right. That's 2 moves.\nFrom (3, 4), he can also go Down to (3, 3), Left to (2, 4), Up to (3, 5).\n(3, 5) is his own body.\n(2, 4) is empty.\n(3, 3) is empty.\nIf he goes Down, he gets closer to (3, 0) and (0, 1).\nIf he goes Right, he gets closer to (5, 4) and (8, 3).\n\nIf I choose DOWN (6, 5):\nI am closer to (8, 3) and (9, 2).\nIf the enemy goes Right, I can compete for the right apples?\nNo, the right apples are far for him.\nIf I choose LEFT (5, 6):\nI am closer to (5, 4) and (3, 0).\nIf the enemy goes Right, he contests (5, 4).\nIf the enemy goes Down, he goes for (3, 0).\n\nIf the enemy goes Right:\nMe: LEFT to (5, 6).\nEnemy: (4, 4).\nNext turn: Me (5, 5). Enemy (5, 4).\nWe both want (5, 4). He gets it first (simultaneous move, but he moves into the apple).\nIf he eats (5, 4), he grows. His tail might not move.\nIf I move into (5, 4) while he is there (head or body), I die.\nSo contesting (5, 4) with the enemy seems risky if he is also going for it.\n\nIf I choose DOWN (6, 5):\nI am targeting the right apples (8, 3) or (9, 2).\nThe enemy is on the left.\nWe are in different areas. Less chance of collision.\nThe apple at (5, 4) is still there.\nIf the enemy doesn't take it immediately, I can loop back for it.\nIf the enemy takes it, I lose that apple, but I stay safe.\n\nLet's consider the board geometry.\nMy body is currently a \"wall\" on the right (x=6 to 9 at y=7, and x=9 at y=6).\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 5), I am below my body wall.\nMy body becomes: (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6).\nThis creates a \"U\" shape open to the left.\nFrom (6, 5), I can enter this \"U\" (go LEFT to 5,5) or continue DOWN.\nThis seems flexible.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 6), I am outside the \"U\".\nMy body is (6, 6), (6, 7)...\nThis is also flexible.\n\nHowever, looking at the apples at the bottom right (8,3) and (9,2).\nThey are relatively close to (6, 5).\n(6, 5) is at y=5. (8, 3) is at y=3.\nDistance: |6-8| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4.\nFrom (5, 6): |5-8| + |6-3| = 3 + 3 = 6.\nSo (6, 5) is definitely better for the bottom-right apples.\n\nThe apple at (5, 4).\nFrom (6, 5): |6-5| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\nFrom (5, 6): |5-5| + |6-4| = 0 + 2 = 2.\nSame distance.\n\nThe apple at (3, 0).\nFrom (6, 5): 3 + 5 = 8.\nFrom (5, 6): 2 + 6 = 8.\nSame distance? 5+3=8, 6+2=8. Yes.\nWait. (6,5) -> (3,0) is dx=3, dy=5. Total 8.\n(5,6) -> (3,0) is dx=2, dy=6. Total 8.\nSame.\n\nThe apple at (0, 1).\nFrom (6, 5): dx=6, dy=4. Total 10.\nFrom (5, 6): dx=5, dy=5. Total 10.\nSame.\n\nThe apple at (9, 2).\nFrom (6, 5): dx=3, dy=3. Total 6.\nFrom (5, 6): dx=4, dy=4. Total 8.\n(6, 5) is better.\n\nSo (6, 5) is strictly better for the right-side apples and equal for the others.\nThe right-side apples (8, 3) and (9, 2) are 2 apples. The left-side cluster is (5, 4), (3, 0), (0, 1) (3 apples).\nBut the enemy is on the left.\nIf the enemy goes for the left cluster, I might get squeezed.\nIf I go for the right cluster, I have the area to myself.\nAlso, (8, 3) and (9, 2) are close to the edge.\nFrom (6, 5), I can go DOWN to (6, 4) -> (6, 3) -> (7, 3) -> (8, 3).\nThis path seems clear. Row 3 is `. . . . . . . . A .`.\nRow 4 is `. . . 0 . A . . . .`.\nRow 5 is `. . . T . . . . . .`.\nRow 6 is `. . . T . . 1 . T T`.\nSo the path (6,5) -> (6,4) -> (6,3) -> (7,3) -> (8,3) is clear.\nRow 4 has a `0` at (3,4). That's the enemy head? No, the enemy head is at (3,4). Wait, the grid shows `0` at (3, 4). Yes.\nSo my path is far away from the enemy.\nThis seems like the safest and best strategic move.\n\nThe only risk is if the enemy moves DOWN to (3, 3).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN, he goes towards (3, 0).\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 5), I go towards (8, 3).\nWe are moving away from each other.\nThis is good.\n\nThe alternative is LEFT to (5, 6).\nFrom (5, 6), I can go DOWN to (5, 5).\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 4), we are getting closer.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (3, 3), we are separating.\nIt's harder to predict the enemy's move from the left side.\nFrom the right side, the enemy is far.\n\nSo I will choose DOWN.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (6, 5). This positions me to safely access the apples at (8, 3) and (9, 2) on the right side of the board, while maintaining distance from the enemy snake on the left.\n\nDOWN",

That's also 2 moves (Down, Left). But (5, 4) is at y=4. From (6, 4), I can go LEFT to (5, 4). So Down then Left is also 2 moves.\nHowever, (5, 5) is a safer intermediate step than (6, 4)?

If the enemy is simply moving away from (5, 4), then moving into (5, 4) would result in a \"head-on collision\" (if it moves towards me) or me entering a cell that is still occupied (if the game processes turns in a specific order, though typically simultaneous means checking outcomes). To be safe, I should verify if I can kill the enemy.\n\nLet's look at the enemy snake #0 at (5, 4) with body [(4, 4), (3, 4), ...].\nThe enemy has 4 open cells around it: UP (5, 5), DOWN (5, 3), LEFT (4, 4), RIGHT (6, 4).\n- DOWN (5, 3): Empty. Safe.\n- UP (5, 5): Empty. Safe.\n- LEFT (4, 4): Part of its own body (segment 1). If the enemy moves LEFT, it hits its own body and dies.\n- RIGHT (6, 4): My current head position. If the enemy moves RIGHT, it hits my head (head-on collision), so both snakes would die.\n\nThe enemy is very likely to move DOWN to (5, 3) to avoid death and perhaps eat the apple at (3, 0) in the future. If the enemy moves DOWN, (5, 4) becomes empty. I can safely move LEFT to (5, 4) and eat the apple.\n\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT (into me), we both die. If the enemy moves UP or DOWN, I get the apple at (5, 4). Only if the enemy moves LEFT (suicide) do I not get the apple, but I also don't die.\n\nSo, moving LEFT is the optimal play. It offers a high probability of gaining a point and a length extension, and a low probability of death (only if I am wrong about the board boundaries or the enemy moves into me).\n\nLet's double-check the board.\nMy body is at [(6, 5), (6, 6), ...].\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 4):\n- My head moves to (5, 4).\n- My body shifts: (6, 4) becomes the new segment after head (if I wasn't eating). Wait, if I eat the apple at (5, 4), I do not lose my tail this turn.\n- Current tail is (9, 7).\n- The segment (6, 4) is currently empty (it's where my neck was, but my head moved from (6, 4) to (6, 5)? No.\n- Wait. My current head is (6, 4). My body is [(6, 5), (6, 6), ...].\n- If I move LEFT to (5, 4):\n  - New head: (5, 4).\n  - Body: [(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), ...].\n- Is (6, 4) safe? Yes, it's currently my body's neck, but after the move, it becomes the new neck. It is not occupied by the head or other body parts in a conflicting way.\n- The only danger is the enemy snake at (5, 4).\n\nBased on the likelihood of the enemy moving DOWN (to (5, 3)) to chase the apple at (3, 0), moving LEFT seems correct. If the enemy moves RIGHT, we die, but that's a risk I have to take to win.\n\nAlternative: Move DOWN to (6, 3). This is safe and avoids the enemy head-on risk.\nDistance to (5, 4) from (6, 3) is 2 moves.\nFrom (6, 4) moving left is 1 move (and eating).\nThe risk/reward favors LEFT.\n\nWait, looking at the enemy body: (4, 4), (3, 4)...\nIf the enemy moves LEFT into (4, 4), it dies.\nIf the enemy moves UP/DOWN, it lives.\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT into (6, 4), it dies (head-on).\nSo the enemy is forced to move UP or DOWN to live.\nIf the enemy moves UP, I get the apple.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN, I get the apple.\n\nThus, LEFT is the correct move.\n\nLEFT\nPlan: Move LEFT to (5, 4) to eat the apple. The enemy snake at (5, 4) will likely move DOWN or UP to avoid death. If it moves into me, we both die, but that is unlikely given its path to the bottom-left apples. Eating this apple extends my length and brings me closer to the cluster of apples on the left/bottom edge.\n\nLEFT",
