Moving **RIGHT** also moves me towards the apple at (7,7) and keeps the board edge to my right, which is generally safe.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nSince Snake #0 is to my left, moving **LEFT** creates a 50/50 chance of death if they move right. Moving **RIGHT** is the safest move; it avoids the enemy, stays on the board, and sets up a path to the apples in the lower right quadrant.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move right towards the (7,7) apple, avoiding the enemy snake on the left side of the board.

Safe.\n\n**Opportunity & Strategy:**\n*   **Immediate Goal:** Navigate towards the apple at (6, 0) while maintaining safety.\n*   **Move Selection:**\n    *   I cannot move UP.\n    *   **LEFT** to (4, 5) keeps me on the Y=5 row, same as the enemy head at (1, 5). While I am far away, this row is generally active.\n    *   **RIGHT** to (6, 5) moves towards the (6, 0) apple but keeps me on the same Y-axis as the enemy.\n    *   **DOWN** to (5, 4) moves towards the (6, 0) apple and moves me away from the enemy's current row (Y=5).\n\n**Reasoning:**\nI will move **LEFT** to (4, 5).\nWait, let's re-evaluate. My goal is (6, 0).\nFrom (5, 5), Manhattan distance to (6, 0) is |5-0| + |6-5| = 5 + 1 = 6.\nMoving DOWN to (5, 4) changes distance to |4-0| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5. (Approaching)\nMoving LEFT to (4, 5) changes distance to |5-0| + |6-4| = 5 + 2 = 7. (Receding)\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 5) changes distance to |5-0| + |6-6| = 5 + 0 = 5. (Approaching)\n\nWhy LEFT then?\nThe enemy Snake #0 is at (1, 5). Moving LEFT puts me at (4, 5).\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT, it goes to (2, 5).\nIf I move LEFT and it goes to (4, 5), there is still a gap.\nHowever, looking at the board state, the area to the left (X < 5) seems more open in the upper rows.\nSpecifically, looking at the apple at (3, 2). If I stay at (5, 5), I am far from (3, 2).\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 5), I am slightly closer to (3, 2) (Distance: |2-5| + |3-4| = 3+1=4 vs currently 3+0=3).\nActually, the most valuable path is towards (6, 0).\nLet's look at the board.\nRow 6: `T . . . . T . . .` (My tail is at 6,6? No, my tail is at 5,6 based on body list `[(5, 6)]`.\nWait, the board state shows:\nRow 6: `T . . . . T . . .`\nRow 5: `T 0 . . . 1 . . .`\n\nMy Head is 1 at (5, 5).\nMy Body is T at (5, 6).\nThe board shows `T` at (5, 6) and `1` at (5, 5).\nSo the board visualization is accurate for my position.\n\nWhy choose LEFT?\nIf I go DOWN to (5, 4), I am entering the \"field\" where the enemy is at (1, 5).\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 5), I am also entering that field.\nActually, let's look at the body of the enemy.\nEnemy Head: (1, 5). Body: [(0, 5), (0, 6)].\nThe enemy is on the far left (X=0, 1).\nI am at X=5.\nDistance is 4 units.\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 5), distance becomes 3.\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 4), distance is |4-1| + |5-0| = 3 + 5 = 8? No. Manhattan distance from (5,4) to (1,5) is |4-5| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5.\nDistance from (5,5) to (1,5) is 4.\nDistance from (4,5) to (1,5) is 3.\nSo moving LEFT brings me slightly closer to the enemy on the same Y axis.\n\nLet's reconsider the apples.\nApples: (6, 0), (8, 2), (3, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0).\nThe closest is (6, 0) or (3, 2).\n(6, 0) is at the bottom right.\n(3, 2) is in the middle left.\n\nIf I move DOWN, I head straight for (6, 0).\nIf I move RIGHT, I head straight for (6, 0).\nIf I move LEFT, I head towards (3, 2) or (1, 1).\n(6, 0) is very close (6 steps).\n(3, 2) is 4 steps away? No, from (5, 5) to (3, 2) is |2-5| + |3-5| = 3+2=5 steps.\nSo (6, 0) is 6 steps away. (3, 2) is 5 steps away.\n(3, 2) is actually closer!\nAnd (3, 2) is in the \"middle\" of the board, while (6, 0) is at the edge.\nWait, looking at the board:\nRow 2: `. . . A . . . . A .` -> (3,2) and (8,2).\nRow 0: `. A . . . . A . . .` -> (1,0) and (6,0).\n\n(3, 2) is at (3, 2).\n(6, 0) is at (6, 0).\nDistance (5,5) -> (3, 2): |5-2| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5.\nDistance (5,5) -> (6, 0): |5-0| + |6-5| = 5 + 1 = 6.\n\nOkay, (3, 2) is closer.\nTo get to (3, 2), I need to go LEFT and DOWN.\nIf I go DOWN now, I am getting further from (3, 2).\nIf I go LEFT now, I am getting closer to (3, 2).\nIf I go LEFT, I go to (4, 5).\nFrom (4, 5), I can go DOWN to (4, 4) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 2) -> (3, 2). That's 4 steps from (4, 5).\nFrom (4, 5) to (6, 0) is longer.\n\nSo, the strategy shifts to the closer apple (3, 2).\nWhy is (3, 2) better?\nIt is in the middle of the board. It offers more escape routes.\n(6, 0) is at the bottom right. If I go there, I might get stuck.\n(1, 1) and (1, 0) are near the enemy.\n(8, 2) is far.\n\nSo, I should head towards (3, 2).\nTo go towards (3, 2) from (5, 5), I should go LEFT.\nLEFT puts me at (4, 5).\nIs this safe?\nEnemy is at (1, 5). He is far away.\nMy body is at (5, 6). Moving LEFT to (4, 5) is not backwards.\nBoard is 10x10. (4, 5) is empty.\nSo, LEFT is safe.\n\nWait, let's check the \"Last Move Information\".\nLast turn, I was at (5, 6). I moved DOWN to (5, 5).\nThe Rationale said: \"I will move DOWN to (5, 5)... Although (3, 2) is technically one step closer (6 vs 7), (6, 0) is a straight line down... Moving DOWN towards (6, 0) is a clear path.\"\n\nWait, the \"Last Move Information\" provided in the prompt says:\n\"**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nDOWN\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\"\nAnd the rationale says \"I will move DOWN to (5, 5)\".\nThis implies I *did* move DOWN to (5, 5) (which matches the current state \"Head: (5, 5)\").\nHowever, the rationale *before* that says I decided to move LEFT to (5, 6) (to get from 6,6 to 5,6). That matches the body.\n\nNow, re-evaluating from (5, 5).\nThe rationale for moving DOWN said (3,2) was 6 steps and (6,0) was 7.\nLet's re-verify Manhattan distance.\n(5, 5) to (3, 2): |5-2| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n(5, 5) to (6, 0): |5-0| + |6-5| = 5 + 1 = 6.\nOkay, I was right, (3,2) is closer.\nThe previous rationale said \"(3,2) is 6 steps\", that was a calculation error in the previous turn's thought process (maybe from (5,6)?). From (5,6) to (3,2) is 5 steps. From (5,6) to (6,0) is 6 steps. So (3,2) was closer even then.\n\nGiven (3, 2) is the closest apple and safer (middle of board), I should pivot towards it.\nI am at (5, 5).\nTo get to (3, 2), I should go LEFT.\nLEFT to (4, 5).\nIs there any reason NOT to go LEFT?\nUp is body.\nDown is towards (6,0).\nRight is towards (6,0).\nLeft is towards (3,2).\n\nLet's check for traps.\nIf I go LEFT, I am at (4, 5).\nFuture moves: I can go DOWN or LEFT again.\nThis seems to maintain options.\n\nWhat about the enemy?\nEnemy at (1, 5). If he moves RIGHT, he goes to (2, 5). I am at (4, 5). No collision.\nMy body is at (5, 6).\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 5), and then next turn I go DOWN to (4, 4).\nMy body will be (5, 5) and (5, 6).\nThat's a straight line down from (5, 6) to (5, 5) to (4, 4). Not a 180.\n\nConclusion: LEFT is the best move to target the closest apple (3, 2) and maintain safety.\n\nLong-term plan: Move towards the apple at (3, 2). Avoid the enemy. Watch out for the apple at (6, 0) if I need to loop around later.\n\nLEFT",

No, wait. Visual map shows `T` at (2, 2) relative to Snake #0's column at x=1. Let's re-read the enemy body list: Head (1, 0), Body [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]. The visual map `Grid 2` shows `T`s at (2, 2), (3, 2) which are mine (Snake ID 1). Enemy ID 0 is at x=1.\n    *   Let's re-verify the board state grid:\n        *   Row 2: `. T . 1 . . . . A .`\n        *   Index 0: `.`\n        *   Index 1: `T` (Snake #0 body, since Snake #0 head is at (1,0) and body stretches up).\n        *   Index 2: `.` (This is Empty).\n        *   Index 3: `1` (Me).\n    *   Wait, the text description says Enemy #0 Body: `[(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]`. This means the enemy is strictly on the X=1 line.\n    *   However, the visual map shows `T` at (2, 2). If that `T` is part of the Enemy, then the Enemy text description is incomplete or the visual is misleading.\n    *   **Re-evaluating the Visual Map vs Text:**\n        *   Text Enemy: Head (1,0), Body (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n        *   Visual Row 1: `. T . . . . . . . .` (X=1 is `T`).\n        *   Visual Row 2: `. T . 1 . . . . A .` (X=1 is `T`, X=3 is `1`).\n        *   Visual Row 3: `. T . T . . . . . .` (X=1 is `T`, X=3 is `T`).\n        *   Visual Row 4: `. T . T . . . . . .`.\n    *   If the visual `T` at (2, 2) is strictly Snake #0, then the text body list is missing the segment at (2, 2).\n    *   However, usually, the text list is the ground truth for logic, and the visual is a representation. But I must survive.\n    *   Let's assume the text body list is accurate. `Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]`.\n    *   My potential moves:\n        *   **LEFT to (2, 2):** Is this occupied by Snake #0? The visual says Yes (`T` at (2, 2) under row 2). The text says Snake #0 is at x=1. There is a conflict.\n        *   *Correction:* The visual map shows the board state *after* my last move.\n            *   I moved DOWN from (3,3) to (3,2).\n            *   Enemy moved. Let's assume the visual map is accurate for the current state.\n            *   At (2, 2), the visual shows `T`. Since this is not my body (my body is at x=3), it must be the enemy's body.\n            *   *Hypothesis:* The enemy text description `Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)]` might be the state *before* the enemy moved last turn, or the visual includes the extension.\n            *   Let's look at the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" for Snake #0. It's not provided, but we know it ate an apple.\n            *   If the visual map has a `T` at (2, 2), I cannot move LEFT.\n    *   **Let's treat the Visual Map as the definitive current state for obstacles.** If there is a `T` at (2, 2), I cannot go LEFT.\n    *   **Re-evaluating LEFT:** Visual shows `.` at (2, 2)? Wait, the visual says:\n        `Row 2: . T . 1 .`\n        Indices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n        Index 2 is `T`.\n        So **LEFT is blocked**.\n4.  **RIGHT:** To (4, 2). **SAFE.** Visual shows `.`.\n\n**Strategy:**\n*   I am at (3, 2). My body is at (3, 3) and (3, 4).\n*   **UP** is death (into my body).\n*   **LEFT** appears blocked by the enemy (Visual `T` at 2, 2).\n*   **DOWN** is safe.\n*   **RIGHT** is safe.\n*   **Decision:** I need to move towards the apples. The apples are at (6, 0), (8, 2), (7, 6), (4, 8).\n*   Moving **RIGHT** gets me closer to (6, 0), (8, 2), and (7, 6).\n*   Moving **DOWN** takes me towards (6, 0) but leaves me at y=1.\n*   Let's check `RIGHT` safety. Target (4, 2). Visual says `.`. Is it possible Snake #0 moves into (4, 2)? No, he is far away.\n*   Let's check `DOWN` safety. Target (3, 1). Visual Row 1: `. T . . .`. Index 3 is `.`. Safe.\n*   However, if I move DOWN, I am approaching the board edge (y=0) and the apple at (6,0).\n*   Let's prioritize getting to the center cluster.\n*   Moving **RIGHT** to (4, 2) seems the best approach. It keeps me at y=2 (central vertical) and increases x.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove towards the central apples at (8,2) and (7,6). Avoid getting trapped near the bottom edge.\n\n**Move Selection:**\n*   Up: No (Body).\n*   Left: No (Enemy/Visual).\n*   Down: Possible, but Right is more central.\n*   Right: Best option to reach the cluster of apples.\n\nI will move RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

If I go **UP**, I am committing to the top-left/top-center area.\nLooking at the board, the cluster to the right (x=6,7,8) seems more dense than the top-left (x=2,4).\nI will turn **RIGHT** and move towards the (8,2) apple.\n\n**Move Selection:**\n*   LEFT: Invalid (Self).\n*   DOWN: Valid, but moves away from the main right-side cluster.\n*   UP: Valid, moves towards (4, 8), but leaves the right-side cluster behind.\n*   RIGHT: Valid, moves towards (8, 2), (6, 0), and (7, 6).\n\nI will move RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Visual shows Row 2, Column 8 is `A` (Apple). **SAFE and REWARD**.\n\n**Strategy:**\nCurrent position (7, 2).\n*   **Apple (8, 2)** is 1 step to the right. This is a guaranteed eat.\n*   **Apple (7, 6)** is 4 steps up.\n*   **Apple (6, 0)** is 1 step down and 1 step left (but left is dangerous or blocked by body).\n\n**Choice:** The apple at (8, 2) is directly accessible. Moving **RIGHT** grabs it. I must ensure this move is safe.\nChecking safety:\n*   Board: (8, 2) is within bounds (0-9).\n*   My Body: My body is at (6, 2) and (5, 2). (8, 2) is safe.\n*   Enemy Snake #0: Head at (5, 0).\n    *   Target: (8, 2).\n    *   Distance from enemy head: `abs(5-8) + abs(0-2) = 3 + 2 = 5` moves.\n    *   Enemy move: 1 move.\n    *   Result: Enemy cannot reach (8, 2) this turn.\n    *   Can enemy intercept my path? My path is just this one move. No snake can enter my head's destination (8, 2) this turn if it is not already there (it isn't) or adjacent with a move that lands there (snake is too far).\n    *   Can enemy hit my body? My body is moving. My tail (currently at (5,2)) moves to (6,2). My head moves to (8,2). The only occupied cells this turn are (6,2) (new head connection) and (7,2) (old head, will be occupied by body segment 1 after move).\n    *   Wait, the body update happens after the move.\n    *   My new body list: (8,2), (7,2), (6,2).\n    *   Enemy at (5,0) moving to ... (6,0) is an apple, (4,0) is body, (5,1) is empty.\n    *   Enemy cannot hit my body either.\n\n**Conclusion:** Right is safe, eats an apple, and scores a point.\n\n**Move Selection:**\n*   LEFT: Invalid (Self).\n*   UP: Valid, but misses the immediate apple.\n*   DOWN: Valid, but moves away from the right-side cluster and misses the apple.\n*   RIGHT: Valid, eats apple (8,2).\n\nI will move RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving **LEFT** would be the immediate direction, but (7, 2) is currently occupied by my tail which will move to (6, 2) only after I move. However, (7, 2) is my immediate previous position, and standard Snake rules prevent moving backwards into your own body. Thus, **LEFT** is fatal.\nI must move **UP** or **RIGHT** or **DOWN**.\n*   **DOWN** moves me to (8, 1) and towards (6, 0) (which is an apple, but currently occupied by enemy head?). No, (6,0) is an apple and enemy head is there. The enemy will move off (6,0) or stay. Moving to (8,1) is safe but moves me away from the left-side apples.\n*   **RIGHT** moves me to (9, 2), effectively going to the corner. This is usually bad.\n*   **UP** moves me to (8, 3). This keeps me in the same x-column but increases y. From (8, 3), I can move **LEFT** to (7, 3) next turn (which will be safe as my tail will have moved past) and then **LEFT** to (6, 3) or **UP** to (8, 4). This creates a path towards (7, 4) and (7, 6).\n\nLet's verify safety of **UP**:\n*   Target (8, 3): Empty on board.\n*   Self: Head (8,2) moving to (8,3). Body is (7,2), (6,2), (5,2). Safe.\n*   Enemy Snake #0: Head (6,0). Distance to (8,3) is |6-8| + |0-3| = 5. Enemy moves 1. Cannot reach (8,3). Cannot intercept.\n\nMoving **UP** is the best option to keep options open and head towards the cluster of apples at (7,4) and (7,6).\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Body is [(8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2)].\n    *   *Verification:* I successfully moved LEFT from (8, 4) to (7, 4) to eat the apple. The game state has updated, placing my head at (7, 4). The tail is at (7, 2). The body connects from (7, 4) -> (8, 4) -> (8, 3) -> (8, 2) -> (7, 2).\n*   **Enemy:** Snake #0 Head at (8, 1). Body at [(7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0)].\n*   **Apples:** (7, 6), (4, 8), (2, 5), (1, 9). (Apple at (7, 4) eaten).\n*   **Immediate Goal:** Move safely and potentially target the apple at (7, 6).\n\n**Risk Analysis of Moves from (7, 4):**\n1.  **UP:** To (7, 5).\n    *   Visual check: Row 5 is `. . A . . . . . . .` (Column 7 is empty).\n    *   Snake check: My body occupies (7, 2) and (8, 4) etc. (7, 5) is clear.\n    *   Enemy check: Enemy is at Y=1.\n    *   **SAFE.**\n2.  **DOWN:** To (7, 3).\n    *   Visual check: Row 3 is `. . . . . . . . T .`. Column 7 is `T`.\n    *   Snake check: My body is at (7, 2). The segment at (7, 2) is connected to (8, 2). However, the visual map shows a `T` at (7, 3). The coordinate list is [(8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2)]. Wait, the list is ordered Head-to-Tail. So index 0 is (8, 4), index 3 is (7, 2). The cell immediately behind my head (at 7,4) is (8,4).\n    *   Let's look at the *new* body order. After eating, the tail *might* stay (if the apple was the tail target) or stay if the snake hasn't moved the tail off yet. Wait, in Snake, you only shorten if you *don't* eat. If I ate, the tail stays (or rather, the snake effectively lengthens). The prompt says \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\".\n    *   So the old body was [(8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2)] (from prev turn).\n    *   New head is (7, 4).\n    *   New body is [Old Head, Old Body...].\n    *   New Body: [(8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2)].\n    *   So (7, 3) is empty.\n    *   Wait, let's re-read the \"Visual check\".\n    *   Row 3: `. . . . . . . . T .`\n    *   Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9.\n    *   'T' is at index 8. That is (8, 3). Correct.\n    *   (7, 3) is index 7. That is '.'.\n    *   So (7, 3) is empty.\n    *   However, moving DOWN to (7, 3) puts me at Y=3.\n    *   Enemy #0 Head is at (8, 1). Enemy moves Up to (8, 2) or Left to (7, 1).\n    *   If I move Down to (7, 3), I am safe relative to my body.\n    *   **Update:** Actually, let's check the visual map again.\n    *   Row 4: `. . . . . . . A 1 T .` -> Wait, the prompt text says `1 T .` at the end. This implies (8,4) is '1' and (9,4) is 'T'. But my head is at (7,4) now. The map might be slightly outdated or I'm misreading the visualization.\n    *   *Correction:* The prompt says \"Board state:\" then lists rows 9 to 0. It is a snapshot *before* my move. The text description of my snake \"Head: (7, 4), Body: ...\" is the correct current state.\n    *   So, (7, 3) is `.`.\n    *   **SAFE.**\n3.  **LEFT:** To (6, 4).\n    *   Visual (old): Row 4, Col 6 is `.`.\n    *   **SAFE.**\n4.  **RIGHT:** To (8, 4).\n    *   Visual (old): Row 4, Col 8 is `T`.\n    *   Current Body includes (8, 4).\n    *   **CRITICAL RISK (Suicide).**\n\n**Decision:**\nI want to target the apple at (7, 6) (UP).\nI want to avoid (8, 4) (RIGHT).\nI want to avoid getting trapped.\n\nLet's look at UP to (7, 6).\nTarget is (7, 6). Distance is 2 steps up.\nMove UP now to (7, 5). Next turn I can go UP to (7, 6).\n\nIs (7, 5) safe?\nYes.\nIs there a better move?\n(6, 4) is Left. That takes me away from the apple.\n(7, 3) is Down. That takes me away from the apple.\n\nI will choose UP to approach the apple at (7, 6).\n\n**Strategy:**\nMove UP towards the apple at (7, 6). Watch out for Snake #0. If Snake #0 moves UP (to 8,2) and then UP again, it might block my path or head-attack. But for this turn, UP is the best approach.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Every snake's head moves one cell in its chosen direction at the same time.\n- If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point (1 apple).\n- If you move outside the board (beyond the listed coordinate ranges), you die.\n- If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\n- Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\n- If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\n- If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die (head-on collision).\n- If all snakes die on the same turn for any reason, the game ends immediately and the snake with more apples at that moment wins; if apples are tied, the game is a draw.\n- The game ends immediately when any snake reaches 50 apples. If multiple snakes reach 50 or more on the same turn, the snake with the higher apple count wins that round; if tied, it is a draw.\n- The game lasts at most 150 turns.\n- If at any point all opponents are dead and you are alive, you immediately win.\n- If multiple snakes are still alive at the final turn, the snake with the most apples wins. If apples are tied at the end of the game, the game is a draw.\n\nObjective and strategy:\n- You cannot win if you are dead, so never choose a move that obviously kills you.\n- Among the moves that keep you alive, prefer moves that both:\n  * increase your chance of safely eating apples, and\n  * keep future options open (avoid getting trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends).\n\nDecision process for each move:\n1) Consider all four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n2) Eliminate any move that would immediately kill you (off the board, into your own body including backwards, or into another snake's body).\n3) Among remaining safe moves, favor moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available and move you closer to reachable apples while avoiding likely head-on collisions (remember enemy heads will also move this turn).\n\nYou may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\nYou may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\nCoordinate reminder: decreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right. Decreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nThe final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.",

Body at [(7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2)].\n*   **Board State:**\n    *   `T` at (7, 6): This is my tail (from the previous turn, before moving to 8,6).\n    *   `1` at (8, 6): This is my head.\n    *   `T` at (9, 3): Enemy #0 tail.\n    *   `0` at (9, 3): Enemy #0 head (Wait, the board shows `T 0` at row 3. Usually this means `T` is at (8,3) and `0` is at (9,3) or similar. Looking at the text: \"Head: (9, 3)\" for Snake #0. The board shows `T 0` at the end of row 3. This implies (8,3) is `T` (Tail) and (9,3) is `0` (Head).\n    *   `A` at (4, 8), (2, 5), (1, 9), (6, 4), (2, 8).\n\n**Wait, let's re-read the \"Your last move information\" carefully.**\nIt says: \"My Position: Head at (7, 6).\"\nIt says: \"Decision: Eat the apple at (8, 6).\"\nIt says: \"UP\" (This was the chosen move for turn 23? No, the last move was RIGHT based on the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" section). \n\n**Correction on Turn State:**\nThe \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" says **RIGHT**.\nThe \"START LAST RATIONALE\" confirms the previous head was at (7, 6) and moving to (8, 6).\nThe \"Board state\" provided in the prompt is labeled \"Board state:\" and shows `1` at `(8, 6)` (Row 6, Col 8).\nThis confirms I successfully moved **RIGHT** to (8, 6) on the previous turn (Turn 23).\nCurrent Turn is **24**.\nCurrent Head is **(8, 6)**.\n\n**Goal:**\nMove from (8, 6) to a safe square, ideally towards an apple.\nApples are at: (4, 8), (2, 5), (1, 9), (6, 4), (2, 8).\n\n**Check Moves from (8, 6):**\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 7):**\n    *   Board row 7: `. . . . . . . . . .`\n    *   (8, 7) is empty.\n    *   Is it safe?\n        *   My body: (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2).\n        *   (8, 7) is not in my body.\n        *   Enemy #0: Head (9, 3), Body (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1).\n        *   (8, 7) is not in enemy body.\n        *   Is there a head-on collision risk?\n            *   Enemy #0 Head at (9, 3). It can move Up(9,4), Right(10,3 - invalid), Left(8,3), Down(9,2 - body).\n            *   I am at (8, 6).\n            *   If I go Up to (8, 7), enemy moves to (8, 3). No collision.\n            *   If I go Up to (8, 7), enemy could potentially move to (9, 7) or (8, 7) or (7, 7) if it decides to go way up? No, it's unlikely to reach that far in one turn.\n            *   Actually, I need to check where *I* want to go.\n            *   (8, 7) is empty. Safe.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 5):**\n    *   Board row 5: `. . A . . . . T . .`\n    *   (8, 5) is `T`. (Tail of Snake #0, looking at the board row 5 ending in `T` and row 4 ending in `T T`).\n    *   Wait, let's trace the enemy snake.\n    *   Enemy #0 Body: [(9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1)].\n    *   Head: (9, 3).\n    *   So (9, 2) is body. (8, 2)? No, (7, 1) is part of body.\n    *   Let's look at the board again.\n    *   Row 5: `. . A . . . . T . .` -> (7, 5) is `T`. (This is (x=7, y=5)).\n    *   Row 4: `. . . . . . .

T T` -> (7, 2) is `.`. (8, 2) is `T`. (9, 2) is `T`.\n    *   Row 1: `. . . . . . T T T T` -> (6, 1) is `T`. (7, 1) `T`. (8, 1) `T`. (9, 1) `T`.\n    \n    *   So, (8, 5) is not an obstacle based on the board text? Row 5 shows `T` at (7, 5). (8, 5) in the text is `.` (since the `T` is at the 7th index of that row string, assuming 0-based indexing for the string or coordinates).\n    *   Let's re-read the board string carefully.\n    *   Row 5: `. . A . . . . T . .`\n       Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n       X: 0..9\n       So (0,5)=`.`, (1,5)=`.`, (2,5)=`A`, ..., (7,5)=`T`.\n       My move Down is to (8, 5). (8, 5) corresponds to index 8 in the string, which is `.`.\n       (9, 5) is index 9, which is `.`.\n       So (8, 5) is empty.\n       \n       Is it safe?\n       My body: (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2).\n       (8, 5) is not in my body.\n       Enemy body: (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1). And tails at (7,5), (8,4), (9,4), (8,3), (9,3), (8,2), (9,2)...\n       (8, 5) is not in enemy body.\n       So (8, 5) is safe.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 6):**\n    *   This is my current tail (from turn 23).\n    *   However, I just moved from (7, 6) to (8, 6). The tail (7, 6) will move to (7, 5) or eat?\n    *   If I move LEFT, I go to (7, 6).\n    *   My body currently occupies (7, 6).\n    *   Rule: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n    *   Since I didn't eat an apple this turn (I haven't moved yet, but I am checking if I can move left), the tail will move.\n    *   BUT, the tail moves *after* I move.\n    *   If I move LEFT to (7, 6), and the tail is currently at (7, 6), will the tail move out of the way?\n    *   Current Body: [Head(8,6), (7,6), (7,5)...]\n    *   If I move Left to (7, 6), the new head is (7, 6).\n    *   The tail is currently (7, 6).\n    *   Since I am moving into the tail's *current* position, and the tail will move away, this is usually a safe move in standard snake rules (unless I grew this turn, but I didn't eat on turn 23).\n    *   However, the rules state: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n    *   On turn 23, I moved to (8, 6) (Apple). I ate. I grew.\n    *   So the tail (7, 6) on turn 24 is *not* going to move away this turn.\n    *   Wait. Turn 23: I was at (7, 6). I moved Right to (8, 6). (8, 6) was an apple.\n    *   Since I ate, I did not shrink. I kept the tail.\n    *   So on Turn 24, my body is: (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2).\n    *   The tail is at (8, 2).\n    *   Let's re-verify the tail.\n    *   Start of Turn 23: Head (7, 6), Body [(7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2)].\n    *   Move: Right to (8, 6).\n    *   Eat: Yes.\n    *   New Body: [(7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2)]. The old head (7, 6) becomes the neck.\n    *   Wait, the prompt gives the \"Your snake\" state at the start of the turn.\n    *   \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (8, 6), Body: [(7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2)]\"\n    *   This confirms: Head (8, 6). Neck (7, 6). Tail (8, 2).\n    *   So, if I move LEFT to (7, 6):\n        *   I am moving into my own neck (which is part of the body).\n        *   This is a collision.\n        *   **LEFT is DEATH.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 6):**\n    *   Board row 6: `. . . . . . . . T 1` (Wait, the prompt says \"T 1\" at the end. This implies (8,6) is `T` and (9,6) is `1`? Or (7,6) is `T` and (8,6) is `1`?)\n    *   Let's look at the \"Board state\" provided in the prompt.\n    *   Row 6: `. . . . . . . T 1 .`\n    *   Wait, let's count the characters.\n    *   ` 9 . A . . . . . . . .`\n    *   ` 8 . . A . A . . . . .`\n    *   ` 7 . . . . . . . . . .`\n    *   ` 6 . . . . . . . T 1 .`\n    *   Row 6 string: `. . . . . . . T 1 .`\n    *   Indices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n    *   Index 7: `T` (My tail? No, I'm at 8,6). Ah, the prompt's board shows `T` at (7,6) and `1` at (8,6).\n    *   Wait, the prompt says \"Your snake ... Head: (8, 6)\". So `1` is at (8,6).\n    *   The `T` at index 7 (x=7) in row 6 is likely a previous tail position or something.\n    *   But the text explicitly says `T` is at (7, 6) and `1` is at (8, 6) in the board diagram.\n    *   However, the \"Your snake\" text data overrides the diagram for precise coordinates.\n    *   Let's look at the diagram again.\n    *   Row 4: `. . . . . . . A T T .`\n    *   Row 3: `. . . . . . . . T 0`\n    *   Row 2: `. . . . . . . . T T`\n    *   Row 1: `. . . . . . T T T T`\n    \n    *   My body goes down to (8, 2).\n    *   Row 2 shows `T` at (8, 2). This matches.\n    *   So the diagram is accurate for the *state* at the start of turn 24.\n    *   (8, 6) is my Head `1`.\n    *   (7, 6) is my Neck `T`.\n    *   (7, 5) is empty `.`.\n    *   (7, 4) is empty `.`.\n    *   (8, 4) is empty `.`.\n    *   (8, 3) is empty `.`.\n    *   (8, 2) is `T` (Tail).\n    *   So my body is: (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2).\n    \n    *   Back to RIGHT: (9, 6).\n    *   Row 6: `. . . . . . . T 1 .`\n    *   Index 9 (x=9) is `.`.\n    *   So (9, 6) is empty.\n    *   Is it safe?\n    *   My body: No collision.\n    *   Enemy #0: Head (9, 3). Body... (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1).\n    *   (9, 6) is not in enemy body.\n    *   So RIGHT is safe.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (UP and DOWN and RIGHT):**\n\n*   **UP (8, 7):**\n    *   Empty.\n    *   Leads to area with apples: (4, 8) and (1, 9) are North.\n    *   Risk: I go up. Enemy is at (9, 3). If enemy moves Left to (8, 3), I am safe. If enemy moves Up, it stays at (9, 4). If enemy moves Right (dies). If enemy moves Down (body).\n    *   No head-on collision with Enemy #0.\n\n*   **DOWN (8, 5):**\n    *   Empty.\n    *   Leads to apple at (6, 4). (6, 4) is Left and Down from here?\n    *   From (8, 5): (6, 4) is Left 2, Down 1.\n    *   (6, 4) is an apple.\n    *   However, moving DOWN puts me closer to the enemy snake at (9, 3).\n    *   If I go DOWN to (8, 5), and Enemy goes UP to (9, 4), we are close. If Enemy goes LEFT to (8, 3), we are close.\n    *   It puts me on a \"collision course\" potential.\n\n*   **RIGHT (9, 6):**\n    *   Empty.\n    *   Leads to... right edge of board. (9, 6) is on the edge.\n    *   If I go RIGHT, I am at (9, 6). Next turn I cannot go Right (out of bounds).\n    *   This is a \"dead end\" or \"corner\" behavior. I should avoid getting stuck on the edge.\n    *   It moves me away from all apples. (Apples are at x=4, 2, 1, 6, 2).\n    *   This seems like a bad move.\n\n**Decision Making:**\n\nBetween UP, DOWN, and RIGHT:\n*   RIGHT is bad (edge, away from apples).\n*   DOWN moves me towards the enemy and towards a specific apple (6, 4).\n*   UP moves me towards multiple apples (4, 8), (2, 8), (1, 9) and away from the enemy.\n\nLet's check if (7, 7) is safe.\nRow 7 is all dots. `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.`.\n(7, 7) is empty.\nIs (7, 7) blocked by anything else?\nEnemy #0 is at (9, 3). Cannot reach (7, 7) in one turn.\nSo (7, 7) is safe.\n\nLet's check if (8, 5) is safe.\nRow 5: `. . A . . . . T . .`\n(8, 5) is `.`.\nIs it blocked?\nMy body: (8, 2) to (8, 6) are occupied. (8, 5) is between (8, 6) and (8, 4).\nWait. My body is: (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2).\nSo (8, 5) is **empty**.\nIs there a conflict with the tail?\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 5), my old head (8, 6) becomes neck.\nThe tail is (8, 2).\nWait. If I move DOWN, do I hit my body?\nMy body parts:\n(8, 6) (Head)\n(7, 6) (Neck)\n(7, 5)\n(7, 4)\n(8, 4)\n(8, 3)\n(8, 2) (Tail)\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 5):\nThe new head is (8, 5).\nThe body follows: (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3).\nSince I didn't eat (assuming I don't eat this turn), the tail (8, 2) disappears.\nSo the body is: (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3).\nIs (8, 5) in the body? No.\nIs (8, 5) an apple?\nRow 5: `. . A . . . . T . .`\n(8, 5) is index 8, which is `.`.\nSo no apple. So I don't grow.\nSo (8, 5) is safe.\n\n**Comparing UP vs DOWN:**\n\n*   **UP (8, 7):**\n    *   Safe.\n    *   Moves towards apples at (4, 8), (2, 8), (1, 9).\n    *   Moves away from Enemy #0 (who is at y=3).\n    *   Increases Y coordinate. Higher Y is \"up\".\n    *   Board is 10x10. (8, 7) is safe.\n\n*   **DOWN (8, 5):**\n    *   Safe.\n    *   Moves towards apple at (6, 4).\n    *   Moves closer to Enemy #0 (who is at y=3).\n    *   Decreases Y coordinate.\n\n**Current Status:**\nI have 6 apples. Enemy has 5 apples.\nI need to eat to win.\nThe apple at (4, 8) is a good target.\nThe apple at (6, 4) is also a good target.\n\nLet's evaluate the path to (4, 8) vs (6, 4).\nPath to (4, 8):\nFrom (8, 6) -> Up -> (8, 7) -> Up -> (8, 8) -> Left -> (7, 8) -> Left -> (6, 8) -> Left -> (5, 8) -> Left -> (4, 8).\nOr from (8, 7) -> Up -> (8, 8) -> Left... seems open.\n\nPath to (6, 4):\nFrom (8, 6) -> Down -> (8, 5) -> Down -> (8, 4). Wait, (8, 4) is my body.\nI have to navigate around my body.\nCurrent body: (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2).\nTo get to (6, 4):\nFrom (8, 6), I can't go Down because (8, 5) is clear, but then (8, 4) is my body.\nI would have to go (8, 6) -> (8, 5) -> (8, 4) is blocked.\nSo I can't go straight down.\nI would have to go (8, 6) -> (8, 5) -> (7, 5). But (7, 5) is also my body.\nWait, let's look at the body again.\n(8, 6) (H)\n(7, 6) (N)\n(7, 5)\n(7, 4)\n(8, 4)\n(8, 3)\n(8, 2)\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 5):\nMy body becomes: (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3).\nNow I am at (8, 5).\nI want to go to (6, 4).\nI can't go Left to (7, 5) because (7, 5) is in my body (index 2 of the new body).\nI can't go Down to (8, 4) because (8, 4) is in my body (index 5 of the new body).\nI can go Right to (9, 5). That leads to the corner.\nI can go Up to (8, 6). That's my body (index 1).\n\nSo, if I move DOWN to (8, 5), I am trapped. I can only go Up or Right.\nUp is my body. Right is the corner.\nSo moving DOWN is a trap.\n\nLet's double check.\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 5):\nNew Head: (8, 5).\nNew Body: [ (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3) ].\nCheck neighbors:\nUp: (8, 6) - Part of body.\nDown: (8, 4) - Part of body.\nLeft: (7, 5) - Part of body.\nRight: (9, 5) - Valid? Yes, it's within bounds.\nSo I can go Right.\nBut (9, 5) is empty.\nFrom (9, 5), I can go Up (9, 6), Down (9, 4), Left (8, 5 - my body), Right (10, 5 - invalid).\nSo I can go Up or Down.\nUp to (9, 6) - Empty.\nDown to (9, 4) - Empty.\nSo I am not immediately trapped if I go Right, but I am in a very tight spot (edge of board).\nThis is dangerous. The enemy is at (9, 3).\nIf I go Down to (8, 5), I am forcing myself into a defensive position near the edge.\n\n**UP is the better choice.**\nFrom (8, 6) -> UP to (8, 7).\nNew Head: (8, 7).\nNew Body: [ (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3) ].\nNeighbors of (8, 7):\nUp: (8, 8) - Empty. (Row 8 has `.` at index 8).\nDown: (8, 6) - My neck.\nLeft: (7, 7) - Empty. (Row 7 is all dots).\nRight: (9, 7) - Empty. (Row 7 is all dots).\nSo from (8, 7), I have 3 safe options (Up, Left, Right).\nThis keeps my options open.\nAlso, I am moving towards apples.\n\n**Why not LEFT?**\nWe established LEFT is into my own neck (7, 6), which is body. So LEFT is death.\n\n**Why not DOWN?**\nIt leads to a tight spot (trap) or forces me to the edge where the enemy is.\nThe enemy is at (9, 3). If I am at (8, 7), distance is large.\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 5), distance is smaller.\nAlso, the trap argument is strong.\n\n**Why not RIGHT?**\nMoves to edge, away from apples.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nUP is the only move that provides open space, keeps options available, moves towards apples, and avoids the enemy.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove UP to (8, 7). From there, aim for the apple cluster at (4, 8), (2, 8). Avoid the enemy at the bottom right corner. Keep center/upper board control.\n\nDecision: UP.\n\nUP",

My body extends downwards and left from there, specifically occupying (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), and (8, 2).\n2.  **Eliminating Bad Moves:**\n    *   **LEFT:** Moving to (7, 6) would be moving directly into my own neck (part of my body). This results in death. So, LEFT is invalid.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Moving to (9, 6) is valid, but it places me on the right edge of the board (x=9). This limits my future movement options and moves me away from the apples located in the upper-left and center of the board. It is a poor strategic choice.\n    *   **DOWN:** Moving to (8, 5) is valid, but it leads to a dangerous trap. Looking at the \"Board state\" provided, (8, 5) is empty. However, my body occupies (8, 4) below it. My body also occupies (7, 5) to the left. This creates a \"cage\" where if I move down, I will be surrounded by my own body on three sides, forcing me to turn around or get trapped near the edge.\n3.  **Selecting the Best Move:**\n    *   **UP:** Moving to (8, 7) is safe. Row 7 is clear of obstacles. This move keeps me in the center of the board, maximizing my future movement options (I can go Left, Right, or Up from there next turn).\n    *   **Strategic Goal:** My goal is to reach the apples at (4, 8) and (2, 8). Moving UP is the first step in that direction. The enemy snake is far away in the bottom right, so moving towards the top center is safe from immediate collision.\n\n**Decision:** Move UP to (8, 7) to maintain flexibility and chase the nearest apples.\n\nUP",

My body follows: (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4).\n\nI need to check the four possible moves:\n\n1.  **UP**: Target (8, 9). Checking the board map: Row 9, Col 8 is empty. My body occupies (8, 7) below, but that doesn't block the move. This move is **SAFE**.\n2.  **DOWN**: Target (8, 7). This is currently occupied by my own body (the segment directly connected to my head). This move is **DEADLY** (suicide).\n3.  **LEFT**: Target (7, 8). Checking the board map: Row 8, Col 7 is empty. My body is at (8, 7) and (7, 6), but (7, 8) is currently free. This move is **SAFE**.\n4.  **RIGHT**: Target (9, 8). Checking the board map: Row 8, Col 9 is empty. This move is **SAFE**.\n\nSo, I have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n*   **Apples:** The closest apples are at (4, 8) and (2, 8) to the left, and (1, 9) and (2, 8) in the top-left. Moving **LEFT** puts me directly on the path to these apples. Moving **UP** takes me to the top edge, which might be a good long-term highway, but leaves the apple at (4, 8) accessible only by turning. Moving **RIGHT** takes me away from most apples and towards the edge.\n*   **Safety:** The enemy snake is at (9, 5), quite far away and unlikely to reach me immediately.\n*   **Opponent Analysis:** As noted in the prompt history, the opponent often chooses defensive or wall-hugging moves (like moving Right to the wall). If the opponent moves RIGHT to (9, 6) or (9, 4), they are no threat to me in the left/center area.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **LEFT** is the most efficient move to collect apples. It brings me closer to the cluster at (4, 8) and (2, 8). While the opponent noted that moving right to the edge is limiting, moving left into the open board is the opposite\u2014it opens up the whole board. I must ensure I don't trap myself, but currently, moving to (7, 8) leaves me with options to go UP, LEFT, or DOWN (though DOWN would be risky if my tail doesn't move).\n\nHowever, looking at the map again:\nRow 8: `. . A . A . . . 1 .` (Wait, the prompt says my head is (8,8), but the map shows '1' at (8,8)? No, the map shows the '1' at (8,8). Let's re-read the prompt state.\n\"My head is at (8, 8).\"\nBoard map: Row 8 is `. . A . A . . . 1 .` This is the visual representation. If '1' is at (8,8), then (8,8) is occupied.\nWait, the text description says: \"Head: (8, 8)\".\nThe ASCII map shows: \"9 . A . . . . . . . .\" ... \"8 . . A . A . . . 1 .\"\nLet's count the columns: 0 to 9.\nIndex 0: .\nIndex 1: .\nIndex 2: A\nIndex 3: .\nIndex 4: A\nIndex 5: .\nIndex 6: .\nIndex 7: .\nIndex 8: 1\nIndex 9: .\nSo yes, my head is at (8, 8).\n\nMy body is listed as: `[(8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 4), (8, 4)]`.\nLet's trace my body on the map:\n(8, 7): Row 7, Col 8 -> The map shows Row 7: `. . . . . . . . T .`. Col 8 is 'T'. Correct.\n(8, 6): Row 6, Col 8 -> The map shows Row 6: `. . . . . . . T T .`. Col 8 is 'T'. Correct.\n(7, 6): Row 6, Col 7 -> Col 7 is 'T'. Correct.\n(7, 5): Row 5, Col 7 -> Row 5: `. . A . . . . T . 0`. Col 7 is 'T'. Correct.\n(7, 4): Row 4, Col 7 -> Row 4: `. . . . . . A T T T`. Col 7 is 'T'. Correct.\n(8, 4): Row 4, Col 8 -> Col 8 is 'T'. Correct.\n\nOkay, the map and text match.\n\nNow, evaluating moves from (8, 8):\n**LEFT to (7, 8)**:\nTarget: Row 8, Col 7.\nMap Row 8: `. . A . A . . . 1 .`\nCol 7 is `.`.\nIs it blocked by my body?\nMy body occupies (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), etc.\n(7, 8) is NOT in the body list.\nHowever, I need to consider the tail.\nTail is (8, 4).\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 8), the tail moves to (8, 3).\n(7, 8) is clear.\n(7, 8) is adjacent to my body at (8, 7) and (7, 6), but not occupied.\nSo LEFT is safe.\n\n**UP to (8, 9)**:\nTarget: Row 9, Col 8.\nMap Row 9: `. A . . . . . . . .`\nCol 8 is `.`.\nSafe.\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 8)**:\nTarget: Row 9, Col 9? No, Row 8, Col 9.\nMap Row 8, Col 9 is `.`.\nSafe.\n\n**DOWN to (8, 7)**:\nTarget: My body. Dead.\n\n**Decision Logic:**\nI want to get to the apples.\nApples are at: (4, 8), (2, 5), (1, 9), (6, 4), (2, 8).\nClosest are (4, 8) (distance 3) and (1, 9) (distance 2? Wait. (8,8) to (1,9) is 7 X + 1 Y = 8 steps).\n(8,8) to (4,8) is 4 steps.\n(8,8) to (2,8) is 6 steps.\nWait, looking at the map:\nRow 8: `. . A . A . . . 1 .`\nThere is an apple at (2, 8) and (4, 8). These are very close.\n(2, 8) is at x=2.\n(4, 8) is at x=4.\n(8, 8) is at x=8.\nMoving LEFT moves towards these apples.\n\nThe opponent is Snake #0 at (9, 5). If they move UP, they go to (9, 6). If they move LEFT, they go to (8, 5).\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 8), I am moving away from them.\n\nI need to be careful about trapping myself.\nMy body is at (8, 7) and (7, 6).\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 8), I can next turn go LEFT to (6, 8), DOWN to (7, 7), or UP to (7, 9).\n(7, 7) is currently empty (Row 7, Col 7 is `.`).\nThis seems like a good path.\n\nWait, I should double check the \"Head-On Collision\" rule.\n\"All snakes move simultaneously\".\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 8), and the enemy moves UP to (9, 6), no collision.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (8, 5), no collision.\nIf the enemy moves UP to (9, 6), and I move LEFT, we are far apart.\n\nThe prompt says: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns.\"\n\"Moving LEFT is the correct strategic move to chase the apples at (4, 8) and (2, 8).\"\n\nLet's verify if there are any hidden traps.\nThe map shows an apple at (1, 9). This is also reachable.\nMoving UP puts me on the top wall (9), which is dangerous because if I get trapped there, I have fewer moves. Moving LEFT keeps me in the open.\nMoving RIGHT is definitely bad as it puts me against the wall and away from apples.\n\nSo, LEFT is the best move.\n\nWait, I must check if I am moving into my own tail.\nMy tail is at (8, 4). My move to (7, 8) is nowhere near it.\nAlso, if I move LEFT, my body moves.\nOld head (8,8) becomes neck.\nOld neck (8,7) becomes body.\n...\nOld tail (8,4) disappears.\nNew head (7,8).\nIs (7,8) currently occupied?\nMap says no.\nBody list says no.\n\nOne final check on the \"Backwards\" rule.\nI came from (8, 8). I cannot go back to (8, 8).\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 7), I hit my neck. That is suicide.\nLEFT is not backwards.\nUP is not backwards.\nRIGHT is not backwards.\n\nSo, LEFT is the winning move.\n\nShort term plan:\nMove LEFT towards the apples at (4, 8) and (2, 8). This keeps me centered and away from the enemy.\n\nFinal check:\nThe map shows `1` at (8,8).\nRow 8: `.` `.` `A` `.` `A` `.` `.` `.` `1` `.` (Wait, I miscounted earlier).\nLet's index carefully.\nString: \". . A . A . . . 1 .\"\nSplit by spaces: [\".\", \".\", \"A\", \".\", \"A\", \".\", \".\", \".\", \"1\", \".\"]\nIndices:\n0: .\n1: .\n2: A\n3: .\n4: A\n5: .\n6: .\n7: .\n8: 1\n9: .\nSo my head (8,8) is at index 8.\nLeft of me is index 7: `.`\nSo (7,8) is empty.\nThis confirms LEFT is safe.\n\nDecision: LEFT.\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to approach the apples at (4,8) and (2,8). Avoid getting trapped on the edge.\n\nLEFT",

Moving here is suicide.\n    *   **Result: DEADLY.**\n\n3.  **LEFT**: Target (7, 8).\n    *   Coordinates: (7, 8) is within the board.\n    *   Collision check: My body is at (8, 7), (7, 6), etc. (7, 8) is not listed in my body.

(9, 8) is empty.\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n*   **Apples:** I want to reach the apples at (4, 8) and (2, 8). Moving **LEFT** to (7, 8) is the direct path to these apples. Moving **UP** goes along the wall, which is generally riskier and takes me away from the immediate center apples. Moving **RIGHT** puts me against the wall and away from all apples.\n*   **Safety:** The enemy snake is at (9, 6). If they move UP, they head to (9, 7). If they move LEFT, they head to (8, 6). Neither of these moves will collide with me if I move LEFT to (7, 8).\n*   **Future Moves:** Moving to (7, 8) opens up moves to (6, 8), (7, 9), or (7, 7). (7, 7) is currently empty and could be a good loop back if needed, though forward (6, 8) is the path to the apples. Moving UP to (8, 9) restricts me to (7, 9), (8, 8) (backwards, illegal), or (9, 9) (dead end). Therefore, LEFT is strictly better than UP.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove **LEFT** to approach the apples at (4, 8) and (2, 8) while maintaining central positioning and maximum flexibility.\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to approach the apples at (4,8) and (2,8). This path keeps the center open and avoids the edge where the enemy snake is located.\n\nLEFT",

Opens up access to the left side of the board. From (3, 8), I can go Left, Up, or Down (Right is back to (4, 8) which will be occupied by my tail eventually but next turn it's my body? No, next turn the tail moves. (4,8) will be safe next turn if I move now? Actually (4,8) is currently empty (was the apple I ate). If I move LEFT, my tail moves from (7,6) to (7,7)? Wait, the tail is (7,6). The body is 7 long (excluding head). If I move LEFT, the tail moves. The cell (4,8) becomes part of my body (segment 1). So going RIGHT into (5,8) is definitely hitting my body. Moving LEFT to (3,8) is clear.\n*   **UP (4, 9):** Moves to the wall. This restricts future movement significantly. From (4,9), I can only go Left, Right, or Down.\n*   **DOWN (4, 7):** Moves into a relatively open space. However, looking at the board, there is an apple at (2, 6). My body blocks the path from (4,7) to (2,6) directly if I go down then left? No, my body is at (7,6) and (8,6). (4,7) is clear.\n\n**Strategic Plan:**\nI want to eat the apples at (2, 8) and (1, 9).\nMy current position is (4, 8). I just ate the apple at (4, 8) (I assume, based on the last move rationale saying \"Move LEFT to (4, 8) to eat the apple\"). Wait, the prompt says \"Your last move information: ... LEFT\". And my head is at (4, 8). So yes, I successfully ate the apple at (4, 8).\nNow I need to navigate to the next cluster.\nIf I go **LEFT**, I arrive at (3, 8).\nFrom (3, 8), I can go LEFT to (2, 8) (eating an apple).\nIf I go **UP**, I arrive at (4, 9).\nFrom (4, 9), I can go LEFT to (3, 9) -> (2, 9) -> (1, 9) or (2, 8). But (4, 9) is a corner spot. It's safer to move into the open.\nIf I go **DOWN**, I arrive at (4, 7).\nFrom (4, 7), I can go LEFT to (3, 7) -> (2, 7) -> (2, 6). This is a valid path to the apple at (2, 6).\n\nHowever, the most immediate and accessible apple is at (2, 8).\nGoing **LEFT** is the direct path. It also keeps me away from the wall (x=4 is currently a wall relative to my tail, but x=3 is open).\nThe apple at (1, 9) is also attractive. From (2, 8), I can go UP to (2, 9), then LEFT to (1, 9).\nFrom (3, 8), I can also go UP to (3, 9), then LEFT to (2, 9), etc.\n\nGoing UP to (4, 9) puts me against the wall immediately. From there, I have to make a turn. It's less flexible.\nGoing DOWN to (4, 7) moves me away from the (2, 8) and (1, 9) cluster, towards the (2, 6) apple. While (2, 6) is a good target, the cluster at (2, 8), (1, 9) is denser. Also, my body extends down to y=6 at x=8,7. (2, 6) is accessible but I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nThe best move is **LEFT**. It positions me to eat (2, 8) next, and from there I can pivot to (1, 9) or (2, 6). It keeps my options open and avoids the wall.\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to (3, 8). Next turn, I will likely move LEFT to (2, 8) to eat the apple, or UP to (3, 9) to approach (1, 9). I must watch out for Snake #0 moving, but he is currently far.\n\nLEFT",

The board state shows (3, 7) is empty ('.'). This is a safe move. It moves me towards the center but away from the apples at (2, 8) and (1, 9).\n\nComparing the safe moves:\n- **LEFT** moves directly to an apple at (2, 8). Eating this apple grows my body, which is beneficial. The cell (2, 8) is currently empty and not part of any snake.

A . . . . . . .` -> index 2 is A).\n    *   So, there is NO apple at (2,8) currently on the board.

Let's re-read the board carefully.\n    *   Row 8: `. . 1 T T T T T T T` (Indices 0-9). Index 2 is `1`. Index 0 is `.`. Index 1 is `.`.\n    *   Row 5: `. . A . . . . . . .`.

The first character is the Y-label. The columns are 0-9. So column 0 is `9` (label)? No, the prompt says \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left\". The text diagram has Y coordinates on the left.\n        *   Row 9: `9 . A . . . . . 0 T T`.

I trust the board.\n        *   Apples on board: (2,5), (2,6), (6,4), (0,7), (2,9).\n    *   My head (2,8). Target apple (2,9) is directly UP.\n    *   Target apple (2,6) is DOWN.\n    *   Target apple (1,9) is LEFT/UP? (1,9) is empty on board, but (2,9) is an apple.\n    *   Let's check valid moves from (2,8):\n        *   **UP**: (2,9). Board shows `A` at (2,9) (Row 9, index 2). This is an apple. Safe.\n        *   **DOWN**: (2,7). Board shows `.` at (2,7) (Row 7, index 2 is `.`). Safe.\n        *   **LEFT**: (1,8). Board shows `.` at (1,8) (Row 8, index 1 is `.`). Safe.\n        *   **RIGHT**: (3,8). Board shows `T` at (3,8) (Row 8, index 3 is `T`). This is my body. DEADLY.\n    *   So RIGHT is forbidden.\n    *   Between UP, DOWN, LEFT:\n        *   UP gets an apple immediately. Eating an apple grows the tail, keeping the space behind me safe for one turn (tail doesn't move).\n        *   LEFT moves towards (0,7) and potentially (1,9) (if we believe the text list, or (2,9) if we trust the board).\n        *   DOWN moves towards (2,6) and (2,5).\n    *   Since I am currently on the top edge (Y=8), moving UP (to Y=9) puts me against the wall. If I move UP, I eat the apple. My tail stays. Next turn, I will be at (2,9).\n        *   Next turn options from (2,9): LEFT (1,9), DOWN (2,8 - my tail, safe because I just ate), RIGHT (3,9 - empty), UP (wall).\n        *   This seems safe.\n    *   If I move LEFT to (1,8):\n        *   I do not eat an apple.\n        *   Next turn, tail moves.\n        *   This seems less advantageous immediately.\n    *   If I move DOWN to (2,7):\n        *   No apple immediately.\n    *   The most direct benefit is UP to (2,9).\n\n    *Wait, re-reading the previous turn rationale again:* \"The board state shows (2, 8) is an apple ('A')\".\n    *   Board row 8: `. . 1 T ...`\n    *   Board row 9: `9 . A ...`\n    *   The previous AI saw an 'A' and thought it was at (2,8). It was looking at the wrong row or misaligning. The 'A' is at (2,9).\n    *   However, the text says \"Apples at: ... (1,9) ... (2,6)\".\n    *   If (1,9) is an apple, but the board shows `.` at (1,9), and `A` at (2,9), it's ambiguous.\n    *   Let's assume the Board Visualisation is the ground truth for the *current* state. The board shows an 'A' at (2,9).\n    *   So, moving UP is the only move that gets an apple *right now* based on the board.\n\n    *Double check collision:*\n    *   Move UP to (2,9).\n    *   My tail is at (8,6). I grow. Tail stays at (8,6).\n    *   Enemy #0 head at (7,9).\n    *   Distance between me (2,9) and enemy (7,9) is 5 units. Safe.\n    *   I am safe to move UP.\n\n    *Alternative Strategy:*\n    *   If I move UP, I am at (2,9). I am pinned against the wall.\n    *   If I move LEFT, I am at (1,8).\n    *   Apples visible on board:\n        *   (2,9) - UP\n        *   (2,6) - DOWN 2\n        *   (2,5) - DOWN 3\n        *   (6,4) - Far\n        *   (0,7) - LEFT 1, DOWN 1\n    *   If I go UP to (2,9), I eat. Next turn I can go DOWN (back to 2,8), LEFT (1,9), or RIGHT (3,9).\n    *   If I go LEFT to (1,8), I can then go UP to (1,9) (if apple exists) or DOWN to (1,7).\n    *   If I go DOWN to (2,7), I can then go DOWN to (2,6) to eat the apple there.\n    *   The apple at (2,9) is right now. The apple at (2,6) is 2 moves away.\n    *   Eating now is generally better to extend the tail and prevent it from blocking paths later.\n    *   Also, eating (2,9) prevents the tail from moving and potentially opening a hole for the enemy (though the enemy is far).\n    *   I will move UP.\n\n    *Wait, check the \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" in the prompt.*\n    \"LEFT\"\n    *   The prompt says: \"**START LAST MOVE PICK** LEFT **END LAST MOVE PICK**\"\n    *   And the board shows Head at (2,8).\n    *   So the previous turn I moved LEFT from (3,8) to (2,8).\n    *   That matches the board state. My head is at (2,8).\n    *   Now I must decide the *next* move.\n    *   The apples are at (2,9) (based on board `A` at (2,9)) and (2,6) and (2,5).\n    *   Moving UP eats the apple at (2,9).\n    *   Moving DOWN goes towards (2,6).\n    *   Moving LEFT goes towards (1,8) and (0,7).\n    *   Moving RIGHT goes to (3,8) (my body).\n    *   So I must pick UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n    *Let's look at the text list of apples again:* (2, 5), (1, 9), (6, 4), (2, 6), (0, 7).\n    *   Board shows A at: (0,7), (2,5), (2,6), (6,4), (2,9).\n    *   Text says (1,9). Board says (2,9).\n    *   Text says (2,8). Board says (2,8) is `1`.\n    *   Text says (2,5). Board says (2,5) is `A`.\n    *   Text says (2,6). Board says (2,6) is `A`.\n    *   Text says (6,4). Board says (6,4) is `A`.\n    *   Text says (0,7). Board says (0,7) is `A`.\n    *   The text list has (1,9) and doesn't list (2,9).\n    *   If I trust the text list, (2,9) is empty. If I trust the board, (2,9) is an apple.\n    *   However, I am at (2,8). If (2,9) is empty, moving UP is safe but doesn't get an apple immediately.\n    *   If I move UP to (2,9) and it is empty, I am at (2,9).\n        *   My tail moves from (8,6) to (8,5).\n        *   This opens up (8,6).\n    *   If I move DOWN to (2,7), I am at (2,7).\n        *   Head moves to (2,7).\n        *   Tail moves to (8,5).\n        *   This puts me closer to (2,6) (apple) and (2,5) (apple).\n        *   I can eat (2,6) next turn.\n    *   If I move LEFT to (1,8).\n        *   Head moves to (1,8).\n        *   Tail moves to (8,5).\n        *   I am close to (0,7).\n    *   Let's prioritize the board visualisation `A` at (2,9) because it is the most immediate data. If the board shows an `A`, I should assume there is an apple.\n    *   However, there is a conflict. If the board shows `A` at (2,9) but the text says \"Apples at: ... (1,9) ...\", it's possible the board is updated but the text description of apples hasn't fully synced or is slightly off.\n    *   BUT, the prompt says: \"Apples at: ...\". This is usually the ground truth.\n    *   Let's look at the board again.\n    *   Row 9: `9 . A . . . . . 0 T T`\n    *   If (1,9) is an apple, why is there a `.` at index 1?\n    *   If (2,9) is an apple, index 2 is `A`.\n    *   If (2,8) is an apple, index 2 is `1`.\n    *   It is highly likely the board visualisation is correct for current state.\n    *   And I am currently at (2,8).\n    *   So, I have a choice.\n    \n    *Let's try to be safe.*\n    If I move UP and there is NO apple, I just moved into empty space.\n    If I move DOWN, I am moving towards the cluster of apples at (2,6) and (2,5).\n    \n    Let's look at the enemy.\n    Snake #0 is at (7,9).\n    My potential positions:\n    If I go UP to (2,9): Distance to (7,9) is 5.\n    If I go LEFT to (1,8): Distance to (7,9) is roughly 7.\n    If I go DOWN to (2,7): Distance to (7,9) is roughly 6.\n    \n    Is there any threat of head-on collision?\n    Snake #0 is at (7,9).\n    Can Snake #0 reach (2,9) this turn? No. (Distance 5).\n    Can Snake #0 reach (1,8)? No.\n    Can Snake #0 reach (2,7)? No.\n    \n    So all moves are safe from immediate collision with Snake #0.\n    Self-collision:\n    RIGHT (3,8) is my body.\n    UP (2,9) is not in my body list. My body starts at (3,8).\n    DOWN (2,7) is not in my body list.\n    LEFT (1,8) is not in my body list.\n    \n    So I can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n    \n    If I go UP to (2,9):\n    - I might eat an apple.\n    - I am at the top wall.\n    \n    If I go DOWN to (2,7):\n    - I don't eat immediately.\n    - I am moving towards (2,6).\n    \n    If I go LEFT to (1,8):\n    - I don't eat immediately.\n    - I am moving towards (0,7).\n    \n    The prompt's \"Last Rationale\" said: \"The board state shows (2, 8) is an apple ('A')\". This was incorrect. The board shows my head there.\n    But the rationale also said: \"I will move LEFT to eat the apple at (2, 8)\".\n    Wait. If I was at (3,8) and moved LEFT to (2,8), and the board shows \"1\" at (2,8), then I am there now.\n    Did I eat an apple last turn?\n    If I moved from (3,8) to (2,8), and there was an apple at (2,8), I would have eaten it.\n    My tail would not have moved last turn.\n    My body list is `[(2,8), (3,8), (4,8)...]`.\n    The text says my head is (2,8). Correct.\n    \n    So, for this turn:\n    I am at (2,8).\n    \n    Let's look at the board again.\n    Row 8: `. . 1 T T T T T T T`.\n    Row 7: `A . . . . . . . . .`.\n    Row 9: `9 . A . . . . . 0 T T`.\n    \n    I am at (2,8).\n    Apple at (0,7) (Down-Left).\n    Apple at (2,6) (Down-Down).\n    Apple at (2,5) (Down-Down-Down).\n    Apple at (6,4) (Far).\n    Apple at (2,9) (Up) - on board, not in text list.\n    Apple at (1,9) (Up-Left) - in text list, not on board.\n    \n    I should probably assume the text list is what I need to target.\n    If I target (1,9):\n    I need to move UP and LEFT.\n    If I target (2,6):\n    I need to move DOWN.\n    If I target (0,7):\n    I need to move LEFT and DOWN.\n    \n    If I move UP (to 2,9):\n    - If (2,9) is an apple (board says yes), I eat. Good.\n    - If (2,9) is empty (text says no), I just moved up. I am now at (2,9).\n      - Next turn I can go LEFT (1,9), DOWN (2,8), or RIGHT (3,9).\n      - If I go DOWN to (2,8), that's where I am now.\n      - If I go LEFT to (1,9), that puts me where the text says an apple is.\n    \n    If I move LEFT (to 1,8):\n    - If (1,9) is an apple (text says yes), I am one step away.\n    - If I go UP next turn from (1,8) to (1,9), I eat.\n    \n    If I move DOWN (to 2,7):\n    - I am closer to (2,6).\n    \n    Let's consider the \"Multi-apple Snake game\". Usually, apples are the objective.\n    If I ignore the board visualisation discrepancy and trust the text list:\n    Apples: (2,5), (1,9), (6,4), (2,6), (0,7).\n    My position: (2,8).\n    Closest apples:\n    (1,9): dist = 1+1 = 2.\n    (0,7): dist = 1+1 = 2.\n    (2,6): dist = 2.\n    (2,5): dist = 3.\n    \n    Option 1: Go LEFT (to 1,8).\n    - Next turn I can go UP (1,9) to eat.\n    - Or go LEFT (0,8).\n    - Or go DOWN (1,7).\n    \n    Option 2: Go DOWN (to 2,7).\n    - Next turn I can go DOWN (2,6) to eat.\n    \n    Option 3: Go UP (to 2,9).\n    - Next turn I can go LEFT (1,9) to eat (if apple is there).\n    \n    Which direction gives me the most space?\n    I am currently in row 8. Row 8 is full of my body from X=3 to X=8.\n    My head is at 2. My body is to the right.\n    So my left side is open.\n    Up is wall.\n    Down is open.\n    \n    If I go UP to (2,9):\n    - I am on the wall.\n    - Next turn I must turn.\n    - This might be slightly restrictive, but not deadly.\n    \n    If I go LEFT to (1,8):\n    - I am moving into the open space.\n    - This seems good to keep options open.\n    \n    If I go DOWN to (2,7):\n    - I am moving towards the cluster of apples on the Y-axis.\n    \n    Let's look at the Enemy again.\n    Snake #0: Head (7,9). Body: (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6).\n    This snake is on the right top corner.\n    I am on the left top side.\n    We are far apart.\n    Direct conflict is unlikely next turn.\n    \n    So, it's about efficiency.\n    If I go LEFT, I can eat (1,9) next turn.\n    If I go DOWN, I can eat (2,6) next turn.\n    (1,9) is at Y=9 (top). (2,6) is at Y=6.\n    (1,9) is only 1 move away (after LEFT).\n    (2,6) is 2 moves away (DOWN, DOWN).\n    \n    So, moving LEFT sets me up to eat (1,9) very quickly.\n    However, the board shows `.` at (1,9). If the text list is right, (1,9) is an apple.\n    If the text list is wrong, (1,9) is empty.\n    \n    Let's assume the text list is the goal. If I go LEFT -> UP, I get an apple.\n    If I go DOWN -> DOWN, I get an apple at (2,6).\n    (2,6) is shown as 'A' on the board. This is a reliable signal.\n    (1,9) is not on the board.\n    So, I should probably target (2,6).\n    \n    To get to (2,6) from (2,8):\n    Turn 1: DOWN to (2,7).\n    Turn 2: DOWN to (2,6) [Eat].\n    \n    To get to (2,9) (board apple) from (2,8):\n    Turn 1: UP to (2,9) [Eat?].\n    \n    If I target the board-visualised apple at (2,9):\n    - Move UP.\n    - If I eat, I grow. My tail stays at (8,6).\n    - Next turn, I am at (2,9).\n    - I can go LEFT (1,9) or DOWN (2,8).\n    \n    If I target the board-visualised apple at (2,6):\n    - Move DOWN.\n    - I don't eat yet. Tail moves to (8,5).\n    - Next turn, I go DOWN to (2,6) and eat.\n    \n    Eating an apple *now* is usually better than eating it later.\n    The board shows an 'A' at (2,9).\n    The text says Apples at (1,9) and (2,6).\n    The board shows 'A' at (2,5), (2,6), (6,4), (0,7). It does NOT show (1,9).\n    \n    There is a 4/5 agreement between board and text.\n    Disagreement on (1,9) vs (2,9).\n    I am at (2,8).\n    If I move UP, I hit the spot the board says is an apple.\n    If I move LEFT, I go to (1,8). Then UP to (1,9).\n    \n    Let's check Row 9 again: `9 . A . . . . . 0 T T`\n    Columns: 0=Label, 1='.', 2='A', ..., 7='.', 8='0', 9='T'.\n    So (2,9) is 'A'.\n    \n    Let's assume the text list is slightly outdated or I should prioritize the board.\n    If I move UP to (2,9):\n    - I collide with nothing.\n    - I likely eat an apple.\n    - My tail stays.\n    - This is a safe, productive move.\n    \n    What if the text list is correct and (2,9) is empty?\n    - I move UP to (2,9).\n    - I don't eat.\n    - Next turn I can move DOWN (back to 2,8) or LEFT (1,9).\n    - If I move LEFT to (1,9), and text is correct, I eat.\n    - That would be 2 turns to get an apple (UP then LEFT).\n    - If I move LEFT now to (1,8), then UP to (1,9), it's also 2 turns.\n    \n    So, moving UP now is not worse than moving LEFT now regarding time to eat (1,9).\n    But moving UP now allows me to eat (2,9) if the board is right.\n    Moving LEFT now allows me to eat (2,6) later.\n    \n    Since (2,9) is adjacent, I should check it.\n    \n    Also, consider the board state at Y=8.\n    My body is from X=3 to X=8.\n    Moving LEFT to (1,8) is safe.\n    Moving UP to (2,9) is safe.\n    Moving DOWN to (2,7) is safe.\n    \n    I will assume the board is correct.\n    Move UP to (2,9).\n    \n    Wait, \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself\".\n    My head is at (2,8). My body starts at (3,8) (to the right).\n    The cell \"behind\" my head relative to my body direction (right) is (1,8).\n    Moving LEFT to (1,8) is NOT moving backwards into the body. It's turning away from the body.\n    Moving RIGHT to (3,8) IS moving into the body.\n    Moving UP/DOWN is perpendicular.\n    So LEFT is valid.\n    \n    Let's refine the strategy.\n    I have a cluster of apples at (2,5), (2,6).\n    I have an apple at (0,7).\n    I have an ambiguous apple at (1,9) / (2,9).\n    \n    If I go DOWN (towards 2,6):\n    - I am moving towards the cluster.\n    - I am moving away from the wall (slightly).\n    - I am moving away from the enemy (who is at X=7, Y=9).\n    - This seems to open up more space in the long run.\n    \n    If I go UP:\n    - I hit the wall.\n    - If I eat, I grow.\n    - Next turn I must turn LEFT or DOWN.\n    - If I turn LEFT, I go to (1,9).\n    - If I turn DOWN, I go back to (2,8).\n    \n    If I go LEFT:\n    - I move towards (0,7).\n    - I can then go DOWN to (1,7) or UP to (1,9).\n    \n    Let's look at the coordinates again.\n    (2,8) -> (2,9) is 1 move.\n    (2,8) -> (2,6) is 2 moves.\n    (2,8) -> (0,7) is 2 moves.\n    \n    I should probably go UP. The board shows an apple there.\n    \n    One final check on the text vs board.\n    Text: Apples at: (2, 5), (1, 9), (6, 4), (2, 6), (0, 7).\n    Board (Row 9): `9 . A . . . . . 0 T T`\n    If (1,9) was an apple, index 1 would be 'A'. It is '.'.\n    If (2,9) was an apple, index 2 would be 'A'. It is 'A'.\n    It is much more likely that the text list entry `(1, 9)` is a typo for `(2, 9)`.\n    Or, the board is updated with a new apple at (2,9) that wasn't in the initial list?\n    The prompt says \"Apples at: ...\". This is the *current* turn's apples.\n    There is a conflict.\n    However, the board is drawn. I can see the 'A'.\n    I will trust the visual board `A` at (2,9).\n    \n    So, UP.\n    \n    Wait, if I move UP to (2,9) and there is NO apple (if the board is wrong or I am misreading it), is that fatal?\n    No. I just move to empty space.\n    The only danger is collision.\n    (2,9) is not in my body. (Body starts at 3,8).\n    (2,9) is not in Enemy #0 body.\n    (2,9) is on the board (Y=9).\n    So it is safe.\n    \n    If there IS an apple, I grow.\n    \n    So UP is the best move if I believe the board.\n    \n    What if I play it safe and go DOWN?\n    I am moving towards (2,6).\n    (2,7) is empty.\n    If I go DOWN, I don't eat immediately.\n    But I set up to eat (2,6) next turn.\n    (2,6) is definitely an apple (Board and Text agree).\n    \n    Compare:\n    Option A: UP -> (2,9). Might eat apple (Board says yes, Text says maybe).\n    Option B: DOWN -> (2,7). Definitely eat apple in 2 turns (2,6).\n    Option C: LEFT -> (1,8). Might eat apple in 2 turns (1,9 or 0,7).\n    \n    If I eat NOW, I prevent my tail from moving. This is usually good for defense and space management.\n    If I don't eat, my tail moves. This opens up the space behind me.\n    At (2,8), the space behind me (right side) is full of my body.\n    If I don't eat, my tail moves from (8,6) to (8,5).\n    The cell (8,6) becomes empty.\n    Does that help me? Not immediately, as my head is far left.\n    \n    I am currently quite long (9 segments).\n    Growing longer makes me more vulnerable to being trapped.\n    However, eating an apple is the objective.\n    \n    If I go UP and eat, I grow to length 10.\n    If I go DOWN and don't eat, I stay length 9.\n    \n    Let's stick to the visual board.\n    Row 9: `9 . A ...`\n    This is an apple at (2,9).\n    I will move UP.\n    \n    Wait, is it possible the `A` is at (1,9) and I am misaligning the columns?\n    \"9 . A ...\"\n    Indices:\n    0: '9' (Label)\n    1: '.'\n    2: 'A'\n    So (2,9) is the apple.\n    \n    Okay.\n    \n    One more check: Snake #0.\n    Head at (7,9).\n    Body: (8,9), (9,9), (9,8)...\n    If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (7,8), I am at (2,9). Safe.\n    If Snake #0 moves LEFT to (6,9), I am at (2,9). Safe.\n    \n    I will move UP.\n    \n    Wait, I see the user prompt says: \"Your last move information: ... LEFT\".\n    And the board shows head at (2,8).\n    So I just moved left.\n    Now I need to move next.\n    \n    If I move UP, I go to (2,9).\n    If I move LEFT, I go to (1,8).\n    If I move DOWN, I go to (2,7).\n    \n    Let's reconsider the \"Long Term Plan\".\n    If I go UP to (2,9):\n    - I am at the top wall.\n    - Next moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n    - RIGHT is (3,9). Is that safe? My body is at (3,8). (3,9) is empty. Yes.\n    \n    If I go LEFT to (1,8):\n    - Next moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n    - RIGHT is (2,8) (my old position, will be occupied by my body next turn? No, head moves, body follows). Wait, if I move LEFT, my body shifts. (2,8) will be the second segment. So (2,8) will be occupied. So RIGHT is blocked.\n    - UP is (1,9).\n    - DOWN is (1,7).\n    - LEFT is (0,8).\n    \n    If I go DOWN to (2,7):\n    - Next moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n    - UP is (2,8) (occupied by body).\n    - DOWN is (2,6).\n    - LEFT is (1,7).\n    - RIGHT is (3,7).\n    \n    All options seem open.\n    \n    Why choose UP?\n    Because the board shows an apple there.\n    Why choose DOWN?\n    Because text lists (2,6) as an apple, and I can get there in 2 turns.\n    \n    I will bet on the board visualisation.\n    Move UP.\n    \n    Rationale:\n    The board shows an apple at (2,9). Moving UP gets it immediately. This is the most direct way to score a point and grow. The move is safe from collision. My head is at (2,8), body extends right. (2,9) is empty of my body and the enemy.\n    \n    Wait, I must write the plan for the *next* turn.\n    If I move UP, I will be at (2,9).\n    My tail stays at (8,6).\n    Next turn, I will have options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n    I should probably plan to go LEFT or DOWN to find more apples.\n    But first, I need to survive this turn.\n    \n    Let's double check the \"Apples at\" list vs Board.\n    If I ignore the board 'A' at (2,9) and trust the text list (1,9), then moving UP is bad because I don't eat.\n    But the board is usually the ground truth for the \"State\".\n    The \"Apples at\" is a summary.\n    There is a high chance (2,9) is the intended apple.\n    \n    Let's look at the board row 9 again.\n    `9 . A . . . . . 0 T T`\n    The '0' is at index 8.\n    The 'A' is at index 2.\n    If (1,9) was the apple, index 1 would be 'A'. It is '.'.\n    So (2,9) is the apple.\n    The text list `(1, 9)` is likely a typo or outdated.\n    \n    So, UP.\n    \n    Plan for next turn: \"If I eat the apple at (2,9), I will be at (2,9) with a long tail. I will then look to move LEFT towards (1,9) or DOWN towards the (2,6) cluster, depending on the updated board state.\"\n    \n    Wait, the prompt asks for \"Strategy note to your future self\".\n    \"Eat the apple at (2,9). Then prepare to move towards the cluster at (2,6) or explore the left side.\"\n    \n    Let's be precise.\n    Current head: (2,8).\n    Move: UP.\n    Result: Head at (2,9). Eat apple (if board is correct). Tail stays.\n    \n    If the board is wrong and no apple at (2,9):\n    I am at (2,9). Tail moves to (8,5).\n    I am safe.\n    Next turn I can go LEFT (1,9). If text is correct, I eat (1,9).\n    \n    So UP is a safe move that either eats an apple or positions me to eat an apple next turn.\n    It is a good move.\n    \n    Decision: UP.\n    \n    Wait, is there any reason NOT to go UP?\n    If I go UP, I am at (2,9).\n    The enemy is at (7,9).\n    If the enemy moves LEFT 5 times (impossible), they hit me.\n    If the enemy moves DOWN to (7,8), we are safe.\n    If the enemy moves LEFT to (6,9), we are safe.\n    \n    What if I go LEFT?\n    I go to (1,8).\n    I don't eat.\n    I am further from the enemy.\n    I am closer to (0,7).\n    I am further from (2,6).\n    \n    If I go DOWN?\n    I go to (2,7).\n    I don't eat.\n    I am closer to (2,6).\n    \n    The apples listed:\n    (2,5), (1,9), (6,4), (2,6), (0,7).\n    I am at (2,8).\n    (1,9) is up-left.\n    (2,6) is down.\n    (0,7) is left-down.\n    \n    If I go UP, I check (2,9).\n    If I go LEFT, I check (1,8).\n    If I go DOWN, I check (2,7).\n    \n    I will go UP.\n    \n    One final check: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body\".\n    My body direction is RIGHT (from (2,8) to (3,8)).\n    Backwards is LEFT (to (1,8)).\n    Moving UP is perpendicular. Safe.\n    \n    Okay.\n    \n    Plan:\n    Eat the apple at (2,9). This extends my tail, preventing it from moving and opening space next turn. I will then be positioned to explore the left side for the apple at (0,7) or head back down towards (2,6).\n    \n    Move: UP.\n    \n    Wait, I should check if (2,9) is blocked by the enemy head?\n    Enemy head is at (7,9). Distance is 5. No.\n    \n    So, UP.\n    \n    Actually, wait. The board shows `A` at (2,9).\n    If I move UP, I eat.\n    If I move LEFT, I go to (1,8).\n    If I move DOWN, I go to (2,7).\n    \n    Let's consider the \"Long Term Plan\" format.\n    It should be a note to myself.\n    \n    \"Target the apple at (2,9) by moving UP. After eating, my tail will stay at (8,6). This gives me more room to maneuver. Next turn, I will decide between moving towards (0,7) or (2,6).\"\n    \n    This looks good.\n    \n    One tiny risk:\n    What if the enemy moves to (2,9)?\n    Enemy is at (7,9).\n    (2,9) is 5 units away.\n    Enemy moves 1 unit/turn.\n    Impossible for enemy to reach (2,9) this turn.\n    \n    So, UP is safe.\n    \n    Final check on the board coordinates.\n    (0,0) bottom left.\n    (9,9) top right.\n    Y increases UP.\n    X increases RIGHT.\n    I am at (2,8).\n    UP is (2,9). Correct.\n    \n    Okay.\n    \n    I will write the plan and rationale.\n    \n    Wait, the prompt says: \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n    And \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\n    \n    So:\n    [Plan]\n    [Rationale]\n    UP\n    \n    The rationale should explain why I chose UP over other options.\n    I chose UP because the board shows an apple at (2,9). This is the most direct way to score. Other moves (LEFT, DOWN) do not offer immediate apple consumption based on the board visualisation, though they move towards other apples.\n    \n    I'll also note the discrepancy between board and text just in case, but trust the board.\n    \n    Actually, I don't need to mention the discrepancy in the output. Just the logic.\n    \n    Rationale:\n    My head is at (2,8). The board shows an apple at (2,9). Moving UP allows me to eat this apple immediately. Moving DOWN or LEFT moves me away from this immediate opportunity. Moving RIGHT is fatal (into my own body). Therefore, UP is the optimal move.\n    \n    Plan:\n    Eat the apple at (2,9). After growing, I will re-evaluate the board for the next apple, likely towards the left or back down to the cluster at (2,6).\n    \n    Let's write it.**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nTarget the apple at (2,9) by moving UP. After eating, my tail will remain at (8,6) because I grew, giving me more space to maneuver next turn. I will then position myself to pursue the cluster of apples at (2,6) and (2,5), or the apple at (0,7).\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nMy head is currently at (2, 8). I need to choose a move that avoids collision and allows me to score points.\n\n1.  **RIGHT**: Target (3, 8). The board state and my body list show that (3, 8) is part of my body. Moving here would result in self-collision. This move is fatal.\n2.  **LEFT**: Target (1, 8). This is empty. While safe, it does not immediately result in eating an apple. It moves me towards (0, 7) and (1, 9).\n3.  **DOWN**: Target (2, 7). This is empty. It moves me towards the apples at (2, 6) and (2, 5), but does not allow me to eat immediately.\n4.  **UP**: Target (2, 9). The board visualisation explicitly shows an apple ('A') at this location. The text list of apples mentions (1, 9) but the board shows (2, 9) as the apple. Given the visual evidence, (2, 9) is an apple. This move allows me to eat immediately.\n\nEating an apple is a primary objective. Since moving UP allows me to eat an apple immediately and is safe (no collision with my body or the enemy), it is the optimal choice.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",
