Moves towards (1, 3), but Snake #0 is much closer to that apple.\n\nStrategic Choice:\nMove UP toward (6, 4). From there, I have a clear path to (6, 6) or (8, 4).

They are not an immediate threat to my head at (5, 9), but they are near my body.\n- Since I want to reach the apples on the right side of the board, RIGHT is the more aggressive path toward points, while LEFT is more conservative.\n- Looking at the board, (6, 9) is safe.

This avoids any congestion with my own body segments at (6, 6-9) and gives me a broad path to the targets.\n- Snake #0 is currently at (4, 8) and might move toward the top or center.

Since the enemy has a head at (9, 5), it might move UP to (9, 6), DOWN to (9, 4), or LEFT to (8, 5).

Moving RIGHT to (5, 1) would position me directly to the left of this apple, making it easy to collect on the next turn.

Moving DOWN to (5, 0) would allow me to collect this apple immediately. This is clearly the best strategic move as it increases my score and grows my snake.\n\nI should also consider the enemy snake's potential movements. The enemy snake's head is at (8, 0) and could move UP to (8, 1), DOWN to (8, -1) (which is off the board and would kill it), LEFT to (7, 0), or RIGHT to (9, 0). The most likely moves are UP or LEFT. Moving DOWN to (5, 0) keeps me away from the enemy snake's likely movements and positions me well to collect the apple.\n\nTherefore, the best move is DOWN.\nDOWN",

Given I am currently leading in score (10 to 4), a draw by collision is less desirable than continuing the game.

More importantly, Snake #0's head is at (3, 0), and they have apples at (2, 0) and (1, 0) behind them. They are currently facing LEFT (as they just came from 4,0).\n- Moving UP to (6, 2) is very safe and gives me the most freedom to navigate towards the apples at (0, 7), (0, 8), or (6, 9).\n\nSelection: UP is the most open move.\n\nUP",

It's less likely to move towards me since I'm on the left side of the board.\n\nBetween the two safe moves, LEFT to (2, 0) seems better because:\n1. It moves me closer to apples\n2. It's a direct path to food\n3. The enemy snake is on the opposite side of the board, so there's less risk of collision\n\nI'll choose LEFT to move towards the apples at (1, 0) and (2, 0).\n\nLEFT",

UP: Would move to (1, 1) - This is safe as it's not off the board, not into my own body, and not into the enemy snake's body.\n2. DOWN: Would move to (1, -1) - This is off the board, so it would kill me.\n3. LEFT: Would move to (0, 0) - This is safe as it's not off the board, not into my own body, and not into the enemy snake's body.\n4. RIGHT: Would move to (2, 0) - This is my own body, so it would kill me.\n\nSo I have two safe moves: UP to (1, 1) and LEFT to (0, 0).\n\nLet me analyze these safe moves more carefully:\n\nUP to (1, 1):\n- This moves me away from the apples at (0, 7), (0, 8), (6, 9), (6, 6), and (9, 6)\n- It opens up more space for future moves\n- It keeps me away from the enemy snake's head at (6, 3)\n\nLEFT to (0, 0):\n- This moves me to an empty cell\n- It's closer to the apples at (0, 7) and (0, 8)\n- It keeps me near the bottom of the board\n\nLooking at the enemy snake (ID 1):\n- Its head is at (6, 3)\n- Its body is along the right side of the board\n- It might move towards the apples or continue expanding\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 0), I would be moving towards the apples at (0, 7) and (0, 8). This seems like a good strategic move as it gets me closer to potential apples. The enemy snake is on the opposite side of the board, so there's less risk of collision.\n\nBetween the two safe moves, LEFT to (0, 0) seems better because:\n1. It moves me closer to the apples at (0, 7) and (0, 8)\n2. It keeps me near the bottom of the board where I have more space\n3. The enemy snake is on the opposite side of the board, so there's less risk of collision\n\nI'll choose LEFT to move to (0, 0) and position myself better for future apple collection.\nLEFT",
