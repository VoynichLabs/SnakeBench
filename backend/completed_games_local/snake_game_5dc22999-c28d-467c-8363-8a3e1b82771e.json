We are starting at (6, 1) and that archrival of ours is way up at (1, 7). They think they're safe up there? NOT ON MY WATCH! \ud83d\ude24\n\nLet's break down the vibes:\n- **UP:** Leads toward (6, 2). It's a solid step toward the center and that apple at (5, 1) is right next to us, but maybe we want to position for the long game?\n- **LEFT:** Moves me to (5, 1). YO! That's an immediate apple on Turn 1! We love the content! If we take (5, 1), we grow to size 2 immediately. \ud83c\udf4e\n- **RIGHT:** Moves to (7, 1). No immediate gain, just vibes.\n- **DOWN:** Moves to (6, 0). Puts my back to the wall. We don't want to get boxed in this early, that's amateur hour!\n\nThe enemy is at (1, 7). They are probably going for those juicy apples at (0, 5) or (1, 3). If I go LEFT, I'm not just grabbing a snack, I'm moving toward the lane they need to descend! We need to get big, get long, and cut off their rotation to the bottom half of the map. \n\nAm I scared? NO! We are going for the growth. More segments = more wall to smash their head into later! Let's secure this first apple and start the snowball! \ud83c\udf7f\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:** Grab the apple at (5, 1) immediately. Then, look to path toward (5, 6) or (5, 7) to intercept the rival. If they come down to the bottom-left, I'll be there waiting to wall them off. Stay aggressive, stay hungry!\n\nLEFT",

It directly targets two apples on row 7 at (4,7) and (5,7) and keeps both up and down escape routes clear. It also maintains distance from Snake 0.\n\nImmediate plan: move to (2,7) this turn to start the line along row 7 toward the apples, then continue along to (4,7)/(5,7) to grow.\n\nPotential risks: none on this turn; the Apple drop list includes many spots but there is no enemy interference here.\n\nLong-term: stay on open corridors, force trades when beneficial, and try to lure the opponent into boxed areas later if the chance arises.\n\nMOVE PLAN COMPLETE\n\nRIGHT",

I have the score advantage\u2014if we collide head-on, I win the tie-break if the game ends, but I\u2019d rather just grow so big he has nowhere to run!

We just hit (5, 2), and look at the board\u2014we are sitting pretty in the middle-bottom while that rival is scrambling up top! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\nMy head is at (5, 2) and my tail is behind me at (5, 1). I'm looking at a board full of opportunities, but more importantly, I'm looking at my PREY. Snake #1 is at (2, 8). He thinks he's safe up there? THINK AGAIN!\n\n**THE MOVE BREAKDOWN:**\n- **UP:** Moves us to (5, 3). This is the play, Chat! \ud83d\ude80 It\u2019s clean, it\u2019s aggressive, and it keeps us moving toward the center apples like (4, 4) and (5, 6). We want to be BIG so we can cut him off later.\n- **DOWN:** Moves us to (5, 1). NO! That\u2019s our own body! We aren't here to beat ourselves; we're here to beat the rival! \ud83d\udeab\n- **LEFT:** Moves us to (4, 2). Not bad, but it keeps us lower on the board. We need to gain ground!\n- **RIGHT:** Moves us to (6, 2). This is okay, but moving UP is a more direct path to the heavy apple zones and gives us more lateral options later.\n\n**PRO PLAN:**\nThe rival is at (2, 8). If he goes for the apple at (1, 3) or (0, 5), he has to come DOWN. If I keep moving UP, I\u2019m building a wall right in his face! \ud83e\uddf1 We are going to head through (5, 3) towards (4, 4). If we get that apple, we\u2019re size 3 and he\u2019s going to start panicking. We stay tall, we stay long, and we make him regret ever entering this lobby!\n\nIs he ready for this level of pressure? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Let's get this bread! \ud83c\udf5e\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

We want the W!\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nI'm going **UP**. Why? Because it keeps the center-line pressure. It positions us to contest the (5, 6) apple and keeps us flexible to react to their move. We are building the wall, Chat! If they try to loop around us, they're going to realize there's no room left to breathe! \ud83d\ude24 \n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:** \nWe're going to shadow their Y-axis.

But wait, if they move LEFT to (4, 7) (wait, that's their body) or if they move DOWN to (5, 6), we are setting up a trap.\n- **RIGHT (5, 5):** This moves us toward the apple at (5, 6).

We don't give handouts!\n- **DOWN (4, 4):** NOPE! That's my own tail! We aren't out here throwing for the blooper reel! \u274c\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nLook at the rival at (5, 7). They are currently \"above\" us. If they want that apple at (5, 6), they have to move DOWN. If we move **UP to (4, 6)**, we aren't hitting them, but we are positioning ourselves to PIN them against the top wall or force them to turn away from the center apples. \n\nWait, let's look closer. If I move UP to (4, 6), I am at (4, 6). If they move DOWN, they are at (5, 6). We will be side-by-side. From (4, 6), I can then swing RIGHT to (5, 6) next turn to take the apple or block them! We are playing the long game, boxing them into that top-left pocket! \ud83d\udce6\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE:**\nWe are going UP to (4, 6). This contests the middle-upper area. We need to be careful\u2014if they get that apple at (5, 6), they go to 4 apples. We need to snag the one at (0, 5) or (2, 7) soon to keep pace. Let's stay twitchy! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nUP",

None of those equal our target cells this turn, so no guaranteed head-on trap on this move.\nSTRATEGY: Take the apple now to accelerate the pace and keep multiple escape routes open for the next turns; use the extra length to threaten him and force mistakes.\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Nudge him toward the top-right area and close the net bit by bit; avoid tight cul-de-sacs that could trap us first.\nMove: DOWN\nDOWN",

They just snagged an apple, putting them at 4 points to our 2. They think they\u2019re the main character? NOT ON MY WATCH! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n- **US:** Head (4, 6).

Plus, the point deficit makes this a \"lose-lose\" head-on. \u274c\n- **DOWN (4, 5):** DEAD! That's our own body. Don't be a scrub, Chat! \u274c\n- **LEFT (3, 6):** THIS IS THE PLAY! \ud83e\udde0 Check it out: If we go LEFT to (3, 6), we create space.

They are starting to BOX THEMSELVES IN! \ud83d\udce6\n\n**BIG BRAIN STRATEGY:**\nBy moving **LEFT**, we escape the immediate pressure of their head at (5, 6). We are heading toward the apple at **(0, 5)** and **(2, 7)**. While they are tangled up in the (4, 8) area, we are going to loop around and cut off their exit! We need those apples to close the score gap so we can eventually force that head-on collision on OUR terms! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nWait, look at Snake #1's head at (5, 6). If they move UP to (5, 7), they hit their own body! If they move LEFT to (4, 6), they hit where we just were! Their only safe moves are RIGHT to (6, 6) or DOWN to (5, 5). Either way, moving **LEFT** keeps us alive and gives us the most breathing room to relocate. Let's get that apple at (2, 7) and take control of the left side! \n\nSTAY HYPED!

Opponent is at (4,6) with body [(4,5),(4,4)]. Apples are everywhere, but we\u2019re focusing on the enemy and the space between us.\n\nSAFETY FIRST, OPTIONS ANALYSIS: UP is illegal (smashes into your own neck). LEFT would collide with the opponent\u2019s head given current positioning. SAFE moves are DOWN to (5,5) or RIGHT to (6,6).\n\nDETAILED ENGAGEMENT LOGIC: If we go RIGHT to (6,6), the opponent\u2019s only legal move on the next turn becomes (3,6) because (4,7) would be blocked by our new body, (5,6) would be occupied by our chain, and (4,5) is their own body. The same blocking logic applies if we go DOWN to (5,5): their only safe option is also (3,6). So either choice initiates a forced drift to the left, tightening the board around them and buying us time to trap them later.\n\nWHY THIS DIRECTION: Pushing right gives us room to steer toward the right-top apple cluster later, while consistently forcing them into a narrowing corridor. We stay alive, keep multiple escape routes, and maintain the lead (4 apples vs 2).\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN NOTE: Build a widening net toward the top-right, avoid dead-ends, and pressure them toward the corner or a wall. If the right opportunity pops (a clean head-on or a blunder into our body), take it\u2014though we\u2019ll prioritize safety and board control first while the lead holds.\n\nRIGHT",

Absolute rookie mistake, we aren't doing that! \u274c\n- **DOWN (3, 5):** SAFE! This opens up the path to the apple at (0, 5) and (3, 1). It keeps us away from the rival\u2019s head at (6, 6). \u2705\n- **LEFT (2, 6):** SAFE! This is a solid horizontal move. It keeps us flexible. \u2705\n- **UP (3, 7):** AGGRESSIVE! Look at this, Chat! If we go UP to (3, 7), we are one step away from the apple at **(2, 7)**. BUT WAIT\u2014look at the rival\u2019s body! (4, 7) and (5, 7) are occupied. If we go UP, we are getting closer to being squeezed against their tail. \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nWe need to close the score gap. If we go **UP**, we can snag (2, 7) next turn. The rival is at (6, 6). If they move LEFT to (5, 6), they are just following their own tail trail. If they move UP to (6, 7), they are staying away. By moving UP, we position ourselves to grab that apple at (2, 7), bringing us to 3 apples. \n\nWait... look at (4, 7)! That is part of the rival's body. If we move UP to (3, 7), and then the rival moves LEFT twice, they could try to pin us against our own body or the wall. However, if we take the **LEFT** move to (2, 6) first, we have a clear diagonal path to both the (2, 7) apple and the (0, 5) apple without getting \"pinched\" between the rival and the edge.\n\nActually, let's look at the \"Safety First\" meta. The rival is at (6, 6). If we go **UP** to (3, 7), we are directly adjacent to their body at (4, 7). That's spicy! But if we want to win, we need that apple at (2, 7) NOW. We need to grow so we can start body-blocking them. \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove UP to take the (2, 7) apple. After that, we pivot LEFT toward the (0, 5) apple or DOWN toward the cluster at (2, 1) and (3, 1). We need to stay mobile. The rival is slightly bunched up; if we can get equal in length, we can force them to crash into their own trailing tail! LET'S GET IT!\n\nUP",

We are the underdog right now, but that just makes the comeback CLIP even better!\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n- **US:** Head at (3, 7). Body: (3, 6), (4, 6). We are 3 segments long.\n- **RIVAL:** Head at (7, 6). Body: [(6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 7)]. They are 5 segments long.\n- **DANGER ZONE:** Look at (4, 7). That is the rival's tail tip. Since they aren't eating an apple this turn, that spot will be empty next turn! But we can't move into it *this* turn.\n\n**THE MENTAL STACK:**\n- **UP (3, 8):** SAFE! This takes us towards the top wall. Is there content there? Not really, just a long walk to (6, 9). \n- **DOWN (3, 6):** DEAD! That's our own body. We don't sell! \u274c\n- **RIGHT (4, 7):** DEAD!

It\u2019s an apple, it\u2019s growth, and it moves us away from the rival's head at (7, 6). If the rival tries to move towards us (LEFT), they'd be at (6, 6). They are still miles away! We grab the apple, we look at the board, and we plan our next move toward the apple at (0, 5) or maybe loop back down to (3, 1). \n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nSnag (2, 7) this turn. Then, we look at the (0, 5) apple. The rival is currently congested in the (4,6) to (7,6) area. If they keep moving left, they might trap themselves against the wall or their own body.

Look at the scoreboard\u2014we are sitting at 4 apples, and our rival has 5. They are bigger, but they are getting TIGHT against that right wall! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n**SITUATION REPORT:**\n- **US:** Head at (2, 8). Body: [(2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6)]. We are looking sleek!\n- **RIVAL:** Head at (9, 6). They just hit the edge! Their Body: [(8, 6), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7)]. They are literally pressed against the boundary at x=9. \n- **THE FIELD:** There are apples everywhere, but look at (1, 6) and (0, 5). Those are calling our name!\n\n**THE MENTAL STACK:**\n- **UP (2, 9):** SAFE! This takes us to the top row. It\u2019s okay, but there are no immediate apples there. \ud83d\udfe6\n- **DOWN (2, 7):** DEAD! That's our own neck, chat! We aren't doing the \"reverse-into-self\" fail today! \u274c\n- **LEFT (1, 8):** SAFE! This sets us up to pivot down toward the apples at (1, 6) and (0, 5). It keeps us mobile and far away from that rival's mess. \u2705\n- **RIGHT (3, 8):** SAFE! But why go toward the center where it's crowded? We want to maintain our territory! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:**\nWe are going **LEFT** to (1, 8). Why? Because we need to reposition! The rival is stuck at (9, 6). If they go UP to (9, 7), they are chasing apples but getting even more squeezed against the wall. By moving LEFT, we open up the entire left side of the board for ourselves. We can swoop down for the (1, 6) and (0, 5) apples while the rival is busy navigating the cramped right side! We are playing the long game, chat! We keep our tail moving and our options wide open! Let's make them sweat! \ud83d\udca6\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nMove LEFT to (1, 8), then calculate the path to (1, 6). We want to stay flexible. If the rival tries to come across the middle, we\u2019ll be ready to cut them off. We are faster, we are smarter, and we are going to OWN this 10x10 grid! STAY TUNED!\n\nLEFT",

RIGHT is off-board and LEFT slams into our own neck, so that\u2019s a no.\n\nWHY UP (9,7) IS THE CALL:\n- Apple at (9,7) drops this turn. Eating it +1 apple, +1 length. We want that lead.\n- No risk of running into the enemy this turn\u2014Snake #0\u2019s head is on the left; they can\u2019t collide with us this move.\n- Sets us up for the next grab at (9,8) if that apple is still there on the next turn. Keeps us on the right edge with multiple escape options.\n\nWHY DOWN IS LESS IDEAL NOW:\n- Doesn\u2019t eat this turn, giving the opponent room to close the gap or run a different route.\n- Less immediate fruit gain, harder to press the \u201cbox\u201d on their left flank later.\n\nLONG-TERM GAME PLAN (short-term focus for next few turns):\n- Primary goal: snowball apples on the right edge to push the score gap wider (you\u2019re 5 vs 4).\n- Use the top-right area as a staging ground; eat (9,7), then (9,8) if available, and keep lines open to dodge any stray pursuits.\n- If Snake #0 ever misreads and ventures toward the right, aim for a safe head-on only if it guarantees a clean KO with a higher score; otherwise prioritize safety and fruiting.\n\nDECISION PROCESS SUMMARY:\n- Evaluated all four directions, filtered out illegal moves (off-board, self-collision, enemy-body collision).\n- Chose the move that maximizes immediate fruit intake while preserving future escape routes and keeping pressure on the opponent.\n\nExecuting move:\nUP",

We are going to close the score gap, gain that extra length, and keep our coils ready to box them in if they dare venture into the bottom half of the map! We are playing chess while they are playing checkers! \u265f\ufe0f\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nDrop DOWN to (1, 7), then snag the apple at (1, 6). After that, we eye the apple at (0, 5) or look to cut off the rival if they try to escape the right side. We stay flexible, we stay hungry, and we stay ALIVE! LET'S GET IT!\n\nDOWN",

If they go UP to (9, 9), they are hitting the corner. If they go LEFT to (8, 8), they are moving toward the center. We are staying on our side of the street for now. By moving **DOWN** to (1, 6), we get our 5th apple, grow a bit, and position ourselves to either dive deeper for more food or pivot to block them if they try to cross the board. We're playing the long game, chat! We need that size to challenge them later! \u265f\ufe0f\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nSnag the apple at (1, 6) now. Next turn, we look at the apple at (0, 5) or (1, 3) to keep the momentum going. We want to stay flexible in the middle-left area. If the rival starts moving toward our territory, we'll have the length to make things uncomfortable for them. STAY HUNGRY, STAY TACTICAL! LET'S GOOO!\n\nDOWN",

It preserves more room to maneuver and plants us closer to the rival\u2019s lane, giving us future pressure to force mistakes.\n\nWhy not UP? Sure, grab the top-right apple, but it tightens the corridor to a single path and could invite a trap along the edge later. \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nCurrent plan: eat at (8,8) now for growth; keep two safe exits (after the move you can swing toward (8,9) or (7,8) as needed). Then pressure toward the left side gradually to threaten a boxed-in feel while not letting the rival slip free.\n\nLong-term: use the longer, flexible body to threaten a head-on if the rival missteps, but keep space to veer if they push toward you.\n\nStance on turn: aggressive but safe. We snack now, set up future cross-traffic, and keep options open.\n\nDeciding move now:\nLEFT",

They've got a massive body trail from (7, 8) down to (6, 6).\n\n**THE RADAR:**\n- **UP (0, 6):** SAFE! This takes us further up the left wall. It's open space, but we aren't moving toward the apple clusters below.\n- **RIGHT (1, 5):** **BACKWARDS!** That's where our neck is! If we go here, it's game over and chat will never let us live it down! \u274c\n- **LEFT (-1, 5):** **OFF THE BOARD!** We aren't ghosts, chat!

Their head is pretty far, but they are bulky. If they keep moving left, they might try to contest the middle. We need to descend NOW to claim the territory at (1, 3), (3, 2), and (3, 1). By moving DOWN to (0, 4), we are positioning ourselves to loop around and secure the bottom-left corner. We have 6 apples; they have 8. We need to eat!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nWe are going DOWN to (0, 4), then we keep heading DOWN toward that apple at (1, 3). Once we secure the bottom wall area, we'll have the length to start curving back toward the middle. Snake #1 is coiled up high\u2014if we take the bottom, we effectively split the board and force them to play in the cramped top-right! Let's get these gains!\n\nDOWN",

More importantly, it keeps us glued to the wall, making it impossible for anyone to get behind us. We are securing the entire bottom-left quadrant for ourselves! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**THE GAME SENSE:**\nSnake #1 is way up at (5, 8). If they want to contest these bottom apples, they have to travel a long way through the middle. While they're busy navigating the top, we're going to feast!

We are playing for the late-game squeeze! \ud83c\udf4b\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nWe go DOWN to (0, 3), then we grab the apple at (1, 3). After that, we sweep right to pick up (3, 2), (3, 1), and (1, 0). By the time Snake #1 realizes we've taken the bottom floor, we'll have more length and better positioning to box them into the top-right corner.

But wait\u2014check the score! Snake #1 has 8 apples to our 6? Are they actually trying to flex on us? NOT TODAY! We are playing chess while they are playing checkers!\n\n**THE BATTLEFIELD RECAP:**\n- **US (ID 0):** Head at (0, 3). Our tail is snaking up the (1, x) column. We are tucked in, safe, and ready to feast!\n- **RIVAL (ID 1):** Head at (5, 9). They just hit the top wall! They are way up there, basically in the nosebleed section, while we control the ground floor!\n\n**WHERE DO WE GO? ANALYZING THE PLAYS:**\n- **LEFT (-1, 3):** INTO THE VOID! That\u2019s a game over, chat. We don\u2019t do that here! \u274c\n- **UP (0, 4):** **BACKWARDS!** That\u2019s our own neck! We aren't trying to choke! \u274c\n- **DOWN (0, 2):** Safe!

If we take this, we hit 7 apples and close the gap on our rival. It\u2019s also wide open space!\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN STRATEGY:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (5, 9). If they want to stop us from clearing out the bottom-left quadrant, they have a massive journey ahead of them. They are currently boxed against the top edge. We are going to grab the apple at (1, 3), then pivot to grab the cluster at (3, 2), (3, 1), and (2, 1). We are going to out-grow them and then use our massive length to cut off the entire middle of the board!\n\nThey think they're winning because they have 8, but we're about to go on a heater! Let's secure this apple and keep the momentum! WE NEVER BACK DOWN! \ud83d\ude24\n\nRIGHT",

Ultra-skim plan: fight on the top edge, widen our lead, and keep two safe exits open.\n\nSAFE MOVES CHECK:\n- UP: off the board (y would be 10) \u2014 dead. not an option.\n- DOWN: would run into our own neck at (5,8) \u2014 dead. not an option.\n- LEFT: to (4,9) \u2014 safe, but misses the obvious apple on the top edge.\n- RIGHT: to (6,9) \u2014 safe, and there is an apple waiting at (6,9). Eat = +1 apple, push ahead 9\u20136.\n\nDECISION: RIGHT. Grab the top-right apple and keep the top-row pressure. This also reinforces our lane control near the wall and keeps the opponent boxed toward the left.\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN:\n- Turn 18: Move RIGHT to (6,9) and eat the apple there. Score climbs; our body length increases, making the top edge our ally.\n- Turn 19+: If the apple at (9,9) or other top-row apples appear, we\u2019ll swing along the top to stack more growth, staying away from the left snake to avoid any accidental head-on with their head.\n\nMID/LONG-TERM STRATEGY:\n- Maintain the top-edge corridor with a tight but safe shape. Don\u2019t backtrack into your own neck; push rightward along the top while leaving escapes toward the left and toward (9,9) open.\n- Use the wall to limit the left snake\u2019s options and threaten a forced head-on only if it creates a guaranteed win, not a turbo risk.\n- If the left snake tightens into a choke near the wall, we exploit space on the top row to slip around them and keep growing without getting boxed in.\n\nOpportunity watch:\n- There\u2019s a juicy apple at (9,9) and (3,9), but chasing (9,9) along the top after (6,9) is safer and still rewarding. We\u2019ll accumulate +1 for (6,9) now and plan the next top-row grab later without sacrificing safe exits.\n\nRIGHT",

We aren't trying to ends the stream early with a self-clash! \u274c\n- **LEFT (0, 2):** Safe, but it puts us against the wall and further from the apple cluster.

Moving RIGHT to (2, 2) puts us in the perfect \"strike zone\" to grab the apples at (3, 2) next turn, then zip down to (3, 1) and (2, 1). It keeps us central and gives us the most flexibility to dodge if Snake #1 tries a desperate dive later!\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN STRATEGY:**\nWe have 7 apples, they have 9. But look at the concentration of food in our area! By moving **RIGHT**, we are positioning ourselves to vacuum up four apples in the next five turns. Snake #1 is stuck in the corner; we are going to grow so large that we basically become a wall they can't cross. We are playing for the late-game dominance! Let's get these points and let's get that W!\n\nRIGHT",

Preserve the top-edge box, force the left snake to funnel toward the wall, and avoid any risky detours. No apple this turn, so stay clean and keep options open for the next move.\n\nLONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTES:\n- Maintain edge dominance to corral Snake #0. Grow when it doesn\u2019t shrink your escape routes.\n- Avoid creating dead-ends near the wall; prioritize safety and space over flashy apple grabs.\n- If a favorable head-on setup arises (and you\u2019re clearly ahead on apples), go for the trade; otherwise keep the pressure and space advantage.\n\nLET\u2019S GOOOOO, STAY HUNGRY, stay alive, and keep that top row locked down.\n\nRIGHT",

If we take this, we grow, we score, and we position ourselves perfectly to sweep the bottom row. \u27a1\ufe0f\n- **DOWN (2, 1):** Also safe and leads to an apple at (2, 1), but moving RIGHT first lets us path through (3, 2) then (3, 1) then (2, 1) for a triple-kill streak of fruit! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**THE MASTER PLAN:**\nWe are going to go RIGHT to (2, 2) -> (3, 2).
