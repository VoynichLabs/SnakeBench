It is not an immediate threat to the apples at (4, 3) or (2, 4).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nThe move **DOWN** to (5, 3) is very flexible. From (5, 3), I can go **LEFT** to (4, 3) to grab the apple. After that, I can continue left towards (2, 3) and then up to (2, 4) and (2, 5) to collect those two apples in a sequence. This path keeps me away from my own segments and the enemy.\n\nDOWN",

Moves closer to (2, 4) and (2, 5).\n- **DOWN (3, 2):** Safe. Moves into open space at the bottom.\n- **LEFT (2, 3):** Safe. Directly below apple (2, 4).\n- **RIGHT (4, 3):** **Death.** This is my neck (moving backwards).\n\n**Strategy and Risks:**\n- Snake #1 is at (1, 4). It is almost certain to move RIGHT to (2, 4) to eat that apple.\n- If I move UP to (3, 4), and Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (2, 4), we will be adjacent.\n- If I move LEFT to (2, 3), and Snake #1 moves RIGHT/DOWN, we could have a head-on collision at (2, 4) next turn, or I could be cut off.\n- The apple at (2, 4) is very contested. Snake #1 is closer to it than I am. \n- However, moving **UP** to (3, 4) positions me well. If Snake #1 takes (2, 4), it will likely then aim for (2, 5). I can potentially contest (2, 5) or move around it. \n- Alternatively, moving **LEFT** to (2, 3) is very aggressive. If Snake #1 moves to (2, 4), and I am at (2, 3), I am directly \"under\" the enemy snake. Given its body is mostly to its left, it might try to turn upward or downward.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving UP to (3, 4) is a balanced move. It keeps me close enough to the apple cluster (2,4)/(2,5) to benefit if Snake #1 moves away, but gives me more flexibility to move RIGHT or UP again to avoid a head-on collision at (2,4) if Snake #1 claims it this turn.\n\nUP",

More importantly, if it stays or we move into each other, it's a collision.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 5):** **POTENTIAL DEATH.** My tail is currently at (5, 5). Usually, a move into the tail is safe as it moves forward. however, my body creates a loop. This direction moves me towards a cluster of apples on the right (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6).\n\n**Risks and Opportunities:**\nSnake #1 is very close to my head (3, 5).

No, the head-on would happen if we both moved to the *same* new cell. If I move UP to (4, 7) and Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (4, 6), they hit the spot I just left.

If they choose UP to (3, 7), they are adjacent to (4, 7).\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 6), I create distance from Snake #1 and head toward a higher density of apples (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6).

Moves away from Snake #1 and toward the density of apples on the right side of the board.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nI am currently at (4, 7) and there is an apple at (4, 8). Snake #1's head is at (3, 7). \nIf I move UP to (4, 8), I get the apple. \nPotential conflicts: If Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (4, 7), they occupy the space I currently occupy; if they move UP to (3, 8), they are adjacent to the apple I just ate. \nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 7), I bypass the immediate apple to head for the group at (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6).\nHowever, (4, 8) is a guaranteed point if Snake #1 doesn't have a way to collision me. Since we move simultaneously, if I move to (4, 8) and they move to (4, 8), we both die. Can Snake #1 reach (4, 8)? Their head is at (3, 7). To get to (4, 8) in one move, they would have to move diagonally, which is impossible. Their possible moves are (3, 8), (2, 7), (4, 7), or (3, 6) (down is blocked by their tail). None of these are (4, 8).\n\nTherefore, UP to (4, 8) is perfectly safe from a head-on collision this turn.\n\n**Plan:** Move UP to (4, 8) to collect the apple. Then assess whether to turn RIGHT to head toward (8, 6) or continue navigating the top.\n\nUP",

No snake parts there. Moves toward the top edge.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 6):** **Eats Apple.** (8, 6) is an apple. Snake grows.\n3.  **LEFT (7, 7):** **DEATH.** Hits neck.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 7):** Safe. No snake parts there.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n*   **Score:** I am behind (10 vs 12). I need to prioritize apple collection.\n*   **Apple Sequence:** The apple at (8, 6) is directly below my current head. Moving DOWN immediately secures a point and positions me next to two more apples: (9, 6) and (8, 5). \n*   **Space:** Snake #1 is far to the left, confined mostly to columns 0-3. I have total control over the right side (columns 5-9).\n*   **Immediate Path:** \n    *   Turn 43: DOWN to (8, 6) - Get Apple.\n    *   Turn 44: DOWN to (8, 5) - Get Apple OR RIGHT to (9, 6) - Get Apple.\n    *   Turn 45: Continue to (8, 2).\n\nMoving DOWN is the most efficient way to start harvesting the current cluster.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nConsume the cluster on the right-hand side starting with (8, 6), then (8, 5) and (9, 6). After clearing (8, 5), head south for the apple at (8, 2). Continue to monitor Snake #1's movement to ensure they don't migrate into the bottom-right territory.\n\nDOWN",

Alternatively, grabbing (8, 5) then (9, 6) is a very tight 2-turn sequence.\n\nDOWN",

If I go DOWN first, I have to come back UP later to get (9, 6), which might be blocked by my own body as it grows and trails behind.\n*   If I move RIGHT to (9, 5), the path is: (9, 5) -> (9, 6) [Eat] -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4) -> (9, 3) -> (9, 2) -> (8, 2) [Eat]. This allows me to clear the edge and then sweep the bottom.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (9, 5). Next turn, move UP to (9, 6) to collect the apple.

Into own body. **Death.**\n*   **DOWN:** (5, 8). This cell was my tail last turn, but according to the current body list, it is still occupied by my tail segment (5, 8). However, as I move, the tail at (5, 8) will move to (6, 8). *Wait*, let's re-verify the body list: `[(6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8)]`. Since I am currently (5, 9), my tail at (5, 8) will vacate this turn. However, moving into a vacating tail is generally safe unless I grow. Since I just ate an apple at (5, 9) last turn, I have grown, meaning my tail (5, 8) stays put this turn. Therefore, (5, 8) is a collision. **Death.**\n*   **LEFT:** (4, 9). This cell is empty. It is safe.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nMoving LEFT to (4, 9) is the only survivable move. This puts me in a position to wrap around the top-left or head down column 4/3 to reach the apple at (5, 7) or (0, 5). Snake #1 is currently at (7, 4) and moving toward the bottom/center, so there is no immediate threat of collision.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (4, 9). Then, continue moving LEFT or DOWN to navigate around the current body cluster. My goal is to reach (5, 7) or (0, 5) while ensuring I don't trap myself against the top wall.\n\nLEFT",

Snake #1 is at (7, 1), so (5, 5) is safe from immediate head-on collisions.\n*   **LEFT:** (4, 6). **Safe.** Plenty of space, though it stays in the middle.\n*   **RIGHT:** (6, 6). **Safe.** However, it moves toward my own body at (8, 6) and (9, 6).\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\n- There is a cluster of apples in the bottom half: (6, 3), (2, 1), and (4, 0).\n- Snake #1 is positioned at (7, 1), making (6, 3) a competitive target.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (5, 5) puts me in a direct line to contest (6, 3) or pivot toward (4, 0) and (2, 1). It also avoids the congested top-left/right areas where my own body segments are located.\n- Going LEFT to (4, 6) is also viable, but DOWN feels more direct for apple acquisition.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will move DOWN to (5, 5). My next objective is to secure either the apple at (6, 3) or (4, 0). I must watch Snake #1 (Head: 7, 1); if they move UP toward (7, 2) or (7, 3), I need to be careful not to get cut off.

No snake bodies here.\n*   **DOWN (4, 4):** **Death.** Snake #1's body is at (4, 4).\n*   **LEFT (3, 5):** Safe. No snake bodies here.\n*   **RIGHT (5, 5):** **Death.** This is moving backward into my own body.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (6, 2) and is very close to the apples at (6, 3), (4, 0), and (2, 1). My head is trapped in a narrow area bounded by my own body above and to the right, and the enemy's body below. \n- Moving **UP** to (4, 6) puts me in a very tight corridor (x=4) between my body at x=5 and the enemy body at x=1/2. However, my body segments at (5, 6) and (5, 7) will move soon.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (3, 5) gets me closer to apple (0, 5). \n\nLooking at the board, if I go LEFT to (3, 5), I am at a distance of 3 from (0, 5). If I go UP to (4, 6), I am at a distance of 6 from (2, 8). \nThe enemy head at (6, 2) is likely going for (6, 3) or heading towards the bottom-left cluster. Crucially, the enemy body at (4, 4) and (5, 4) blocks my path downward. I must navigate around the enemy's long tail.\n\nMoving LEFT seems best to maintain space and potentially contest (0, 5) or loop around to the bottom.\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to (3, 5) to gain maneuverability and head toward (0, 5).\n\nLEFT",

Note: (4, 6) is currently empty, but I am surrounded by my own segments at (3,5), (4,5), (5,6), (4,7).\n\n**Potential for Traps:**\nI am currently in a somewhat narrow corridor bounded by the board edge (x=0, x=1) and my own body (x=3 to 5). To my left, the path to apple (1, 7) and (2, 8) is very clear. Snake #1 is currently tangled in the bottom-right quadrant and poses no immediate threat to my head.\n\n**Plan:**\nMoving UP or LEFT are both good. UP (2, 7) puts me directly below apple (2, 8) and adjacent to apple (1, 7). However, I need to be careful not to box myself in against my own tail at (4,7). Since I just moved UP from (2,5) to (2,6), continuing UP to (2,7) maintains momentum toward the cluster of apples in the top-left area.\n\nUP",

It is safe from my own body and walls. (2, 9) is empty for a next move, though I must be careful of the \"pocket\" at (4, 8) and (4, 9).\n2.  **DOWN (2, 6):** **Death.** This is my own neck.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 7):** **Apple!** Moves onto an apple. Very safe. It keeps me away from the congestion of my body on the right and provides clear paths to (1, 8), (0, 7), or (1, 6).\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 7):** Safe, but puts me in a narrow corridor between my body at (2, 7) and (4, 7). This leads toward my own coiled body and is less efficient than grabbing the nearby apples.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nSnake #1 is far away (y=1) and currently entangled in its own body structure. I have two immediate apples reachable at (2, 8) and (1, 7). \nIf I go LEFT to (1, 7), I am one step away from (2, 8) or (0, 5).\nIf I go UP to (2, 8), I am one step away from (1, 8) or (2, 9).\n\nThe move LEFT (1, 7) seems slightly better for long-term positioning as it keeps me further from the \"wall\" created by my tail segments at (4,7), (4,8), and (4,9), giving me more room to maneuver around the left edge of the board.\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to collect the apple at (1, 7), then aim for (2, 8) or (0, 5) depending on accessibility.\n\nLEFT",

The safest and most accessible apple is at (0, 5) or navigating the perimeter.\n\nMoving UP to (2, 9) allows me to use the top edge (row 9) to reposition. Since (1, 8) is occupied, I cannot move left immediately. After moving to (2, 9), the cell (1, 9) will be free, and I can head toward the left side of the board.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove to the top row (y=9) to bypass my body at (1, 8) and (1, 7).

While safe now, moving right into x=3 keeps me closer to the dense part of my own body.\n\n**Strategy:**\nMoving LEFT is the most logical path. It leads away from the cluster of my own body segments on the right and toward the open left side of the board. My goal is to navigate around the \"hook\" formed by (1, 8) and (1, 7) to reach the apple at (0, 5).

This route provides safety and sets up a trajectory to eventually move back into the center once the tail clears the upper-right area.\n\nDOWN",

As I move down, the tail at (4, 9) will advance, gradually opening up the top and middle-right sections of the board.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will continue moving DOWN to collect the apple at (0, 5). Once at (0, 5), I will likely have to move RIGHT or continue DOWN towards the bottom row depending on how the tail clears and where Snake #1 positions itself. Controlling the perimeter while the body processes through the \"snake-trap\" is the priority.\n\nDOWN",

My tail at (4, 8) will move to (4, 7) this turn, slowly clearing the top-right path.\n\nChoosing DOWN is the most productive move as it directly secures a point and progress toward the bottom edge, away from the dense cluster of my own body in the (1, 7) to (2, 9) area.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nGrab the apple at (0, 5). Monitor Snake #1's movement; it is currently near the center and could contest the middle apples.

This leads toward the apple at (0, 2).\n4.  **RIGHT:** **Safe.** Cell (1, 5) is currently empty. however, my body at (2, 5) and (0, 5) creates a narrow space, and the enemy head is at (4, 4).\n\n**Strategic Outlook:**\nGoing DOWN is the safest path to expanding my territory. My current body forms a massive wall through the center-left. By moving DOWN toward (0, 4), and eventually (0, 2), I can grab an apple and then wrap around the bottom edge. Snake #1 is near (4, 4) and likely moving towards the apple at (4, 6) or (6, 6). If I move RIGHT to (1, 5), I risk getting cornered or facing a head-on collision sooner than necessary. \n\nThe apple at (0, 2) is a clear target. My tail at (4, 8) will continue to move, eventually freeing up the top-right quadrant.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove down the 0-column to collect the apple at (0, 2). From there, navigate the bottom edge (y=0 or y=1) toward the right side of the board. This keeps me away from the self-imposed trap of my own body segments in the (2,7) to (5,7) region until the tail clears.\n\nDOWN",

This snake is currently in the middle of the board and is blocking the path to the apples at (6, 6) and (4, 6).\n*   **Apples:** (8, 8), (4, 6), (9, 3), (6, 6), (0, 2).\n*   **Immediate Surroundings:**\n    *   **UP:** Hits body at (0, 5). **(Death)**\n    *   **LEFT:** Off-board (x = -1). **(Death)**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (1, 4) is currently empty.\n    *   **DOWN:** (0, 3) is currently empty.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- The move **DOWN** (to 0, 3) is the most direct path to the apple at (0, 2). It also keeps me along the edge, which is generally safer given my long body.\n- The move **RIGHT** (to 1, 4) puts me closer to Snake #1 and potentially boxes me in against my own body at (2, 5) and (3, 5).\n- Snake #1 is at (5, 4). If it moves LEFT toward (4, 4), and I move RIGHT to (1, 4), we are shrinking the gap quickly. However, Snake #1's body is very coiled in the bottom-right/center.\n\n**Strategy:**\nGrab the apple at (0, 2) first. It is the most isolated apple and is closest to my current position. By following the x=0 column down, I avoid the congested center and my own snaking body segments. After collecting (0, 2), I will evaluate moving along the bottom row (y=0 or y=1) to reach the apples on the right side of the board (9, 3) or (8, 8).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (0, 3) then (0, 2).

Looking ahead, after taking (0, 2), I will need to navigate towards the bottom-right. The path at y=0 or y=1 currently has segments of Snake #1, but those will likely have moved by the time I reach those columns.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove DOWN to take the apple at (0, 2). After that, the board becomes tight. I will likely need to move RIGHT along the bottom edge (y=1 or y=0 depending on where Snake #1's tail moves) to find a path toward the apples at (9, 3) or (8, 8).

My tail at (5, 7) will move to (5, 6).\n*   If I move **RIGHT** to (1, 2), I move toward the middle.\n\nLooking at the board, Snake #1 is coiled in the center-right. The bottom-left area (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1) is currently open. However, Snake #1's tail is at (8, 1).\nThe most restrictive part of the board for me right now is the fact that I am essentially \"outside\" my own long body. I need to find a way to navigate toward the apples (mostly on the right side) without getting trapped.\n\nThe move **DOWN** to (0, 1) is the safest way to maintain space. If I move RIGHT now, I might get squeezed between my own segments at x=2 and the enemy segments at x=2/3. By moving DOWN, I can eventually wrap around the bottom (y=0) once Snake #1's body clears out of the (2,0)-(5,0) area.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nFollow the perimeter down to (0,0), then evaluate if the path along y=0 is clear of Snake #1's segments.

If I go to (1, 1), I might get stuck if Snake #1 doesn't move its tail/body out of the way quickly.\nMoving **DOWN** to (0, 0) is the safest positional play.

From (0, 0), I can then move to (1, 0) once Snake #1's segments at (2, 0) and (3, 0) move forward. \n\nLooking at Snake #1's head at (6, 6), it is likely going for the apple at (4, 6) or moving toward the cluster at (9, 8). I am currently far behind in position to contest the apples on the right, so my priority is survival and navigating to the bottom-right as segments clear.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove to (0, 0), then wait for the path along the bottom wall (y=0) to clear. Snake #1 is moving its body \"upstream\" away from the (2,0) area.

Body: [(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1)]\n\n**Immediate Move Options for Head (1, 0):**\n*   **LEFT:** Hits body at (0, 0). (Death)\n*   **DOWN:** Off-board (1, -1). (Death)\n*   **UP:** Target (1, 1). This cell is currently empty.\n*   **RIGHT:** Target (2, 0). This cell is currently occupied by Snake #1's body. **Crucially**, since Snake #1's head is moving this turn, every segment of its body will shift forward. The segment at (2, 0) will move to (2, 1). Thus, (2, 0) will be empty when my head arrives.\n\n**Evaluation:**\nSnake #1 is currently coiled in the center-right and top-right. My body is wrapped around the left and top-left edges. \nIf I move **UP** to (1, 1): My next moves would be constricted by my own body at (1, 7)/(1, 8)/(1, 9) and Snake #1's body at (2, 1)/(2, 2). \nIf I move **RIGHT** to (2, 0): I follow Snake #1's tail as it clears the bottom row. This allows me to reach the open space on the bottom-right of the board (x=7,8,9) and eventually contest the apple at (9, 3).\n\nScanning for head-on collisions: Snake #1 at (6, 8) cannot reach (2, 0) or (1, 1) this turn.\n\n**Strategy:**\nContinue tracking Snake #1's tail as it moves away from the bottom-left. Moving to (2, 0) is safe because the body part currently there will move to (2, 1) this turn. This keeps me along the wall and opens up the most board space.\n\nRIGHT",
