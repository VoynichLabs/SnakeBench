Possible moves:\n  - UP -> (5,7): occupied by our own neck, unsafe.\n  - DOWN -> (5,5): empty, safe.\n  - LEFT -> (4,6): occupied by enemy snake #0\u2019s body, unsafe.\n  - RIGHT -> (6,6): empty, safe.\n\n- Among safe options, DOWN aligns with aiming to hit apples along the column x=5 (at (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0)) in successive moves, continuing a plan to cluster around the (5,5)-(6,6) region and sweep downward toward multiple apples. RIGHT would head toward (6,0) but offers fewer immediate apple opportunities and may complicate future routes.\n\n- Decision: choose DOWN to (5,5) to pursue the vertical apple corridor.\n\nDOWN",

Both avoid immediate collisions with any snake body.\n- LEFT (4,4) would set up a route toward the apple at (3,5) in a couple moves, but it\u2019s a tighter corridor with enemy positions nearby (notably the head at (5,3) and adjacent body segments). Potential traps are present along the left side barriers.\n- RIGHT (6,4) points toward the apple at (7,5) fairly directly: from (6,4) you can go to (7,4) (empty) and then to (7,5) to eat the apple. This path seems clearer and less risk-prone in the near term, and it avoids the ongoing pressure from the enemy head at (5,3 this turn).\n- Given the current setup, RIGHT offers a safer, more straightforward apple chase with fewer immediate traps than LEFT.\n\nPlan for next turns:\n- Move RIGHT to (6,4) now.\n- In subsequent turns, aim for the apple at (7,5) by heading to (7,4) and then up to (7,5) to maximize immediate gain while avoiding the dense left-side barrier.\n- Maintain distance from Snake #0\u2019s head at (5,3) to minimize head-on collision risk; monitor their potential moves to (5,2), (6,3), or (5,4).\n- If opportunity arises, also consider collecting nearby apples (e.g., (5,2) if safely accessible later) but avoid stepping onto occupied enemy cells.\n\nRIGHT",
