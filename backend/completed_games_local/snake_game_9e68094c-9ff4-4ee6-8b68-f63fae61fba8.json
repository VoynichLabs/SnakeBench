Let me consider which is strategically better:\n- LEFT takes the apple at (1, 6), moving closer to the apple at (0, 9)\n- RIGHT takes the apple at (3, 6), moving closer to the apple at (3, 8)\n\nThe apple at (3, 8) is directly above (3, 6), which means after moving RIGHT and eating, I can easily move UP next turn to get another apple. This creates a clear path to 2 apples in consecutive turns.\n\nMoving LEFT gives me an apple but the next closest apple would be at (0, 9), requiring me to move UP and then LEFT, which is a bit more spread out.\n\n**Strategy for future turns:**\n- Turn 0: Move RIGHT to (3, 6) - eat apple\n- Turn 1: Move UP to (3, 7) or (3, 8) to eat the apple at (3, 8)\n- Continue collecting apples while maintaining distance from enemy snake\n\nRIGHT is the optimal choice as it secures an apple and positions me for another immediate apple collection.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving RIGHT to (1, 4) is safe, as it stays within bounds, avoids the single enemy head at (2, 6), and I have no body.\nStrategically, moving RIGHT is superior to moving UP. While UP moves towards the apple at (0, 9), it hugs the left edge (x=0). The enemy at (2, 6) is poised to take an apple at (1, 6) or (3, 6). If the enemy takes (1, 6), they will be adjacent to the left edge path. Moving directly UP towards (0, 9) along the edge risks a head-on collision if the enemy contests the path (e.g., moving (1, 6) -> (0, 6) while I move (0, 5) -> (0, 6)). Moving RIGHT first gets me off the edge and into the open board (1, 4), preserving flexibility. From (1, 4), I can adapt: move UP to (1, 5) to pressure the enemy if they take (1, 6), or continue moving right and then UP to safely secure the (0, 9) apple if the enemy moves towards (3, 6). This keeps my options open and minimizes risk.\n\nRIGHT",

Currently I'm at (3, 8):\n- Moving UP to (3, 9) gets me closer to (0, 9) - just 3 cells to the left\n- Moving LEFT to (2, 8) also moves toward (0, 9) horizontally\n- Moving RIGHT moves away from all apples\n\nThe nearest apple is (0, 9) which is at distance 3 from my current position. Moving LEFT approaches it horizontally, while UP gets me to the top row where I can then move left.\n\n**Path Planning:**\nIf I move LEFT now to (2, 8), I can then go LEFT again to reach (0, 9) in 2 more moves. The enemy snake at (1, 6) is below me and shouldn't interfere with this path.\n\nLEFT appears to be the best move - it directly approaches the (0, 9) apple while maintaining options.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:**\nTarget the apple at (0, 9) - it's the closest and most direct. Path: LEFT to (2, 8), LEFT to (1, 8), UP to (1, 9), LEFT to (0, 9). This should take 3 more moves. After that, evaluate the remaining apples at (5, 2), (6, 6), (7, 7), and (9, 1).\n\nLEFT",

This is DEATH.\n\n2. **LEFT to (0, 6):** Safe move, no apple there. But this puts me against the left edge, severely limiting future options (only UP or DOWN would be valid next).\n\n3. **RIGHT to (2, 6):** Safe move, no apple there. This puts me in the same column as the enemy who is at (3, 8). If enemy moves LEFT to (2, 8), we'd be in the same column with one cell between, risking head-on collision on the next turn.\n\n4. **UP to (1, 7):** Safe move, no apple there. Keeps me one column away from the board edge, giving me 3 valid moves next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT - only DOWN is blocked by my body). This is the safest option for avoiding collisions while maintaining flexibility.\n\n**Apple considerations:**\n- UP to (1, 7) keeps me well-positioned to go for either (0, 9) or (7, 7) based on how the game develops\n- The enemy at (3, 8) is closer to (0, 9), so there's less competition for (7, 7)\n\n**Strategy:** UP gives me the best balance of safety and future options. It keeps me away from the edge and doesn't put me on a collision course with the enemy. From (1, 7), I can head toward whichever apple offers the best opportunity.\n\nUP",

This move:\n- Keeps me alive \u2713\n- Moves me toward the apples cluster on the right side of the board\n- I'm currently at the top-left corner, so moving down will eventually allow me to position toward apples at (5, 2), (4, 1), (9, 1) or the upper cluster at (6, 6), (7, 7)\n- Enemy is at (1, 6), not a collision threat at (0, 8)\n\n**Plan for Next Turns:**\nFrom (0, 8), I should move RIGHT to navigate along the left side and then work toward the apples. The apples at (5, 2) and (4, 1) form a lower cluster that might be efficient to target next, or I could head to (6, 6) and (7, 7). I need to maintain flexibility and avoid getting cornered.\n\nDOWN",

It secures an apple immediately, grows my snake, extends my lead over the enemy, and keeps me safe. The path forward remains open for future moves.\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turns:**\n- Turn 14: After collecting (5, 9), consider moving RIGHT toward (7, 7) apple to compete with enemy\n- Alternatively, move DOWN toward middle apples at (5, 2)\n- Monitor enemy position closely - avoid direct collision paths\n- Current lead of 4-2 apples is good; focus on maintaining safety while collecting more\n- The lower apples (4, 1) and (5, 2) are still available as fallback targets\n\nUP",

Moving down would place me at (7, 6), and on the next turn, moving left would be blocked by my shifting body at (6, 6), and up would be blocked by my neck at (7, 7).

However, the enemy is at (5, 9) and can also reach (8, 9) in 3 moves (Right, Right, Right). If I go Right, I reach (8, 9) in 3 moves (Right, Up, Up).

However, I need to be careful about the enemy snake which is at (7, 8) and moving - I don't know which direction they'll move, but they could potentially move left to (6, 8) causing a head-on collision.\n\n- **RIGHT to (7, 9)**: Moves me toward the (8, 9) apple on this top row. This is a safer immediate play - I stay at the top, and the apple at (8, 9) is very close (just 1-2 moves away).\n\nLooking more carefully at the enemy position: Enemy head is at (7, 8).

They are 4 spaces away.

Let's look at their options:\n        *   **UP:** To (9, 7). This is their own neck. **Death** for them.\n        *   **RIGHT:** To (10, 6).

Their head hits my body, so **they die**.\n    *   If the enemy moves **DOWN**, they survive, but I have still gained an apple and length.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving LEFT is the optimal choice. It guarantees an apple. Furthermore, due to the mechanics of growing (tail not moving), it creates a 50% chance (if the enemy moves left) that the opponent dies immediately, giving me the win.\n\nLEFT",

I can collect an apple immediately and increase my lead to 6-4. The right-edge corridor remains safe.\n\n**Strategy Note for Future Turns:**\nAfter collecting the apple at (9, 1), I'll be at position (9, 1) with 6 apples. The next target should be (7, 0) - it's only 2 cells away to the left. The enemy is still far away at (4, 3) and moving slowly. After collecting (7, 0), I can reassess the board for remaining apples. I should maintain my lead and avoid risky moves as my snake grows longer.\n\nDOWN",

Analyze Available Apples:**\n*   Closest targets are **(4, 1)** and **(5, 2)**.\n*   Other apples: (9, 1), (1, 1), (7, 0).\n\n**3. Evaluate Moves:**\n*   **UP (to 4, 4):** Into my own body. **Invalid**.\n*   **LEFT (to 3, 3):** Safe. Moves away from the cluster of apples near column 4 and 5. Reduces maneuverability near the left wall.\n*   **RIGHT (to 5, 3):** Safe. Moves closer to the apple at (5, 2). However, this positions me closer to the enemy snake on the right side of the board. It also commits primarily to the (5, 2) apple, as (4, 1) becomes further away.\n*   **DOWN (to 4, 2):** Safe. This move is strategically superior. From (4, 2), I will be exactly one turn away from the apple at (4, 1). Furthermore, from (4, 2), the apple at (5, 2) is also just one move to the right.\n*   **Flexibility:** Moving to (4, 2) gives me the option to eat *either* (4, 1) or (5, 2) on the next turn, depending on which looks safer or more advantageous at that moment. Moving to (5, 3) limits me mostly to (5, 2).\n\n**4. Enemy Assessment:**\n*   Enemy #1 is at (9, 2). There is an apple at (9, 1). It is highly likely they will move DOWN to eat it. They are contained on the far right.\n*   Staying at x=4 is safer than moving to x=5 to maintain distance from the enemy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **DOWN** to (4, 2) creates the most options, putting me within striking distance of two apples (4,1 and 5,2) while keeping a safe buffer from the enemy snake.\n\nDOWN",

It positions me well to collect multiple apples in sequence\n\n**Plan for Next Turns:**\n- This turn: Move LEFT to (7, 1)\n- Next turn: Move DOWN to (7, 0) to grab the apple\n- Then move LEFT to (6, 0) to grab another apple\n- After that, reassess and potentially move UP toward (5, 2)\n- Keep monitoring enemy position to avoid head-on collisions\n\nLEFT",

Analyze My Snake and Surroundings:**\n*   **Head:** (4, 1)\n*   **Body:** [(4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)]\n*   **Orientation:** Vertical, head pointing down (based on body order). Actually, looking at the coordinates, the head is at y=1 and body goes up to y=6. So the head is at the bottom of the snake column.\n*   **Constraint:** Cannot move UP (into neck at 4, 2).\n\n**2. Analyze Available Apples:**\n*   **(5, 2):** Distance 2 (Right then Up).\n*   **(1, 1):** Distance 3 (Left x3).\n*   **(6, 0):** Distance 2 (Down then Right x2).\n*   **(7, 0):** Distance 3 (Down then Right x3).\n*   **(8, 9):** Far away (enemy territory).\n\n**3. Evaluate Moves:**\n*   **UP (to 4, 2):** Directly into my own neck. **Invalid/Death**.\n*   **DOWN (to 4, 0):** Safe. Moves to bottom row. From here, I can chase apples at (6, 0) or (7, 0).\n*   **LEFT (to 3, 1):** Safe. Moves towards apple (1, 1).\n*   **RIGHT (to 5, 1):** Safe. Moves towards apple (5, 2).\n\n**4. Comparison of Options:**\n*   **RIGHT (to 5, 1):** This move positions me directly below the apple at (5, 2). Next turn, I can move UP to (5, 2) and eat. This is a 2-turn path to food.\n*   **DOWN (to 4, 0):** This moves me towards (6, 0). From (4, 0) -> (5, 0) -> (6, 0). This is a 3-turn path to food. It also ignores the apple at (5, 2).\n*   **LEFT (to 3, 1):** Path to (1, 1) is (3, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (1, 1). This is a 3-turn path.\n*   **Enemy Check:** Enemy is at (8, 1). Moving to (5, 1) maintains a distance of 3 squares from the enemy head. The enemy is blocked to the RIGHT by their own body. Even if they move LEFT twice, I will have moved away or eaten the apple.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **RIGHT** creates the fastest path to the nearest apple (5, 2) and keeps me centrally positioned with good options for the apples on the bottom row afterwards.\n\nRIGHT",

RIGHT takes me directly to the apple at (8, 6), giving me an immediate point and growing my snake. This is an obvious winning move - it both keeps me safe AND collects an apple.\n\nAfter collecting (8, 6), I'll have 9 apples. I'll then need to decide whether to pursue (8, 9) which is 3 up, or pivot toward the western apples. The score is tied at 8-8, so gaining this apple puts me ahead.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**\n1. Take the (8, 6) apple this turn (RIGHT)\n2. Next turn, move UP toward (8, 9) - it's only 3 cells away\n3. Collect (8, 9) to reach 10 apples\n4. Then reassess and potentially move toward the cluster of apples on the left side (1,1), (0,5), (0,6)\n5. Monitor enemy position - currently at (2, 1), relatively far away\n\nRIGHT",

Next turn (turn 40): Move UP to (8, 9) to collect the apple and reach 10 apples\n2. After reaching 10 apples, reassess: I'll need to pursue the remaining apples. The left-side cluster (0, 5), (0, 6), (2, 5) is far but valuable. The (5, 8) apple is closer and on the way.\n3. Monitor enemy position - currently at (0, 1), moving slowly through the bottom-left area. Continue to maintain safe distance.\n4. Keep options open and avoid getting trapped.\n\nUP",

The enemy at (0, 4) is still far away and unlikely to interfere.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\nAfter securing (5, 8), evaluate the (2, 7) apple cluster vs. left-side apples. Enemy is still lagging by 1 apple, so maintaining my lead through safe apple collection is key. Avoid unnecessary risks and keep the board open.\n\nDOWN",

It collects the (5, 8) apple immediately, tying the score at 11-11 with 106 turns remaining. This is critical since I'm currently behind.\n\nAfter collecting this apple, I should pursue the (2, 7) and (2, 5) apple cluster on the left side of the board, which are relatively close together. The enemy is at (0, 6) and appears to be moving around the left edge - I need to be careful not to collide with them while pursuing those apples.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Turn 44 (this turn): Move LEFT to (5, 8) - collect apple #11, tie the score\n- Turn 45: Move LEFT to (4, 8) - head toward the (2, 7)/(2, 5) cluster\n- Turn 46: Move LEFT again or adjust to (2, 7) depending on board state\n- Monitor enemy #0's position carefully as we both move toward the left side of the board\n\nLEFT",

Moving RIGHT will eat this apple immediately, growing my snake by 1 segment and bringing my score to 12 (still behind by 1, but closing the gap). This is a no-brainer move.\n\nAfter eating (6, 7), I'll still have the (7, 7) apple just 1 more move away, so I can chain two quick apples together. The enemy is far away on the left side of the board at (2, 4), so collision risk is minimal.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. Move RIGHT to (6, 7) - eat the apple\n2. Move RIGHT to (7, 7) - eat another apple (score will be 13, tied with enemy)\n3. Decide next based on remaining apple positions and enemy movement\n\nRIGHT",

Moving backwards into my own body is fatal.\n\n2. **DOWN (to 2, 3):** This cell is empty ('.'), so this is safe. It moves me toward the apples at (4, 3), (6, 2), and (8, 3).\n\n3. **LEFT (to 1, 4):** This cell is empty ('.'), so this is safe. However, from there I would have only 2 options since (0, 4) is part of my body.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to 3, 4):** This cell is empty ('.'), so this is safe. This also moves me toward the apples and puts me on a direct path to (4, 3).\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (5, 7), their possible moves are:\n- DOWN to (5, 6) - empty\n- RIGHT to (6, 7) - apple\n- UP to (5, 8) would be fatal (their neck)\n- LEFT to (4, 7) would be fatal (their neck)\n\nThere's no risk of collision with the enemy snake from any of my safe moves.\n\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT, both allow me to move toward the apples. RIGHT to (3, 4) gives me a more central position and puts me on a direct path to (4, 3): (3, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (4, 3). It also keeps me away from the left edge where I have less room to maneuver.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (3, 4), I would have three safe follow-up moves:\n- UP to (3, 5) - empty\n- DOWN to (3, 3) - empty\n- RIGHT to (4, 4) - empty\n\nThis allows me to maintain flexibility while making progress toward the apples. The enemy is closer to the apples at (6, 7) and (7, 7), so I have a clear path to (4, 3), (6, 2), and (8, 3).\n\nRIGHT is the best move as it positions me well for reaching the lower right apples while keeping multiple safe options open.\n\nRIGHT",

The only viable direction is DOWN. This is critical - I'm hemmed in by my own body. Moving DOWN takes me from (7, 7) to (7, 6), which moves me closer to the (8, 5) apple (distance becomes 2). \n\nAfter moving DOWN:\n- From (7, 6), I can move RIGHT to (8, 6), then move to (8, 5) to eat the apple\n- This should open up more maneuverability\n\nThe enemy at (4, 4) is far enough away that collision isn't an immediate concern.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n1. Move DOWN to (7, 6) - positioning toward (8, 5)\n2. Move RIGHT to (8, 6) - getting closer to apple\n3. Move DOWN to (8, 5) - eat the apple and reach 14 apples (take the lead!)\n4. After that, need to carefully navigate back toward central areas to avoid getting trapped on the right edge\n\nDOWN",

I need to monitor collision risk, but currently the enemy is far enough away.\n\n**Next few turns plan:**\n1. Move RIGHT to (8, 6) - position directly above the (8, 5) apple\n2. Move DOWN to (8, 5) - eat the apple, reach 14 apples\n3. Move DOWN to (8, 4) - continue toward (8, 3) apple\n4.

I need to be careful about potential collisions. Looking at the apple cluster at (6, 2) and (6, 1), these are relatively close. The (9, 1) apple is also nearby at distance 3.\n\nDOWN to (8, 2) is a solid move because:\n- It's safe\n- It positions me well for either the (9, 1) apple (1 move right) or the (6, 2) apple (2 moves left)\n- It keeps my options open for next turn\n- The enemy is focused on the left side of the board, so the right side is safer\n\nLEFT to (7, 3) would also work and brings me closer to the (6, 2) apple directly, but DOWN keeps more flexibility.\n\n**Future Strategy Note:**\nAfter this move, plan to collect the (9, 1) apple (move right to (9, 2), then down to (9, 1)). This avoids the enemy territory on the left side of the board. Once that's secured, reassess positioning relative to remaining apples. The enemy is concentrated left, so maintaining a presence on the right side maximizes safe apple collection opportunities.\n\nDOWN",

DOWN moves me to (8, 1), from which I'd need to move RIGHT to (9, 1).\n\nRIGHT is slightly better because it moves me directly toward the apple and positions me on the x-coordinate of the apple target, making the final capture more direct.\n\n**Future Strategy Note:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (9, 2), next turn move DOWN to (9, 1) to collect that apple. This will tie the score at 16-16. After that, reassess - the enemy has territory on the left side of the board. Look to collect (6, 0) or (6, 1) if safe, or pivot to the upper apples at (6, 9) or (9, 9) to avoid direct confrontation. The key is managing the score tightly while maintaining safe distance from enemy territory.\n\nRIGHT",

This leaves DOWN or LEFT as viable options.\n\nLEFT moves me toward the board's interior and keeps me away from edges. This is safer long-term and positions me to potentially reach apples at (6, 9) or (2, 2).\n\nDOWN moves me to (9, 0), which is still at the edge and somewhat isolated.\n\nThe best move is LEFT to (8, 1), which:\n- Keeps me alive\n- Maintains flexibility for future moves\n- Positions me toward available apples\n- Avoids getting trapped in corners\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (8, 1), I should continue navigating toward the apple at (2, 2) or potentially (0, 1) to catch up in score. The enemy is still ahead 18-16. I need to collect apples efficiently to close the gap. Avoid the enemy snake's body which is primarily on the left side of the board around columns 0-2.\n\nLEFT",

Path should be: (6, 1) \u2192 (5, 1) \u2192 (4, 1) \u2192 (3, 1) \u2192 (2, 1) \u2192 (2, 2). After collecting (2, 2), pivot toward (0, 1) if the path is clear.
