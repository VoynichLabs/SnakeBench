No immediate off-board risks or collisions with enemy body.\n\nEnemy snake #1 (head at 1,7, body [(1,8), (2,8)]) has safe moves DOWN (1,6), LEFT (0,7), RIGHT (2,7). Can't move UP due to own body. Likely paths: RIGHT could aim east toward (2,0) apple or column proximity for growth; DOWN might target south for expansion or contesting lower board; LEFT heads west/left-edge. No obvious immediate threat to you\u2014apples at (2,0) and (3,1) are distant/evadeable\u2014but watch for RIGHT moves implying pursuit northward. If enemy aims northwest, apple at (3,1) could be contested; prioritize avoiding west traps.\n\nAmong safe moves:\n- DOWN (7,0): Positions in bottom row, offering only LEFT/RIGHT follow-ups; risks tight spaces if enemy pushes north and chases you south, cutting off vertical movement. Moves you farther from high-y apples like (6,9)/(6,8)/(4,9). Avoid for now.\n- UP (7,2): Good exploration; opens 3 follow-ups (RIGHT to 8,2; UP to 7,3; LEFT to 6,2, where 6,2 is empty). Potential zig-left to x=6 column for upward climbs toward y=8/9 apples, but adds ~8-9 total moves to reach (6,8)/(6,9) via (6,2->UP route). Better long-term than DOWN, but delays your rightward plan to column 9.\n- RIGHT (8,1): Follows prior strategy; gets you to (9,1) next turn (only 1 more RIGHT). From (9,1), 3 follow-ups (RIGHT off-board die; LEFT 8,1 with own tracks; UP 9,2; DOWN 9,0). Keeps options open for quick UP climbs to y=9. Closest/fastest to executing your original route to (9,9) then LEFT to (4,9)\u2014efficient for clearing x=6 body interference and hitting stacked high-y apples. Slight detour possible later if apples flush west, but sticking to right minimizes backsplash.\n\nFavor RIGHT for continued column 9 push: advances eastern options, opposes enemy east/right trends, positions for up-column apple hunts without dead-ends. UP is a solid alternative if pivoting left early feels wiser\u2014but RIGHT aligns better with existing plan to hit (4,9) soon. Avoid DOWN's trap risk.\n\n**Long-term strategy note to future self:** At (8,1) next turn, continue RIGHT to (9,1) for full column-9 access (opens UP/DOWN, blocks reverse tries). Then UP 8 more to (9,9) by mid-turns (aim for effective growth). From there, LEFT across y=9 to (4,9) apple (~5 LEFTs; eat/grow immediately). Post-growth, backtrack RIGHT to (9,9) edge, then zigzag LEFT/DOWN as needed for loops to (6,9)/(6,8) if y=9 apples persist uncontested. Total priority on y=9/x=4-6 apples (8-10 eat potential); monitor enemy RIGHT/down advances\u2014use length for south blocks if pursued west/left. Target 7-8 apples by turn 25-30; reroute only if enemy nears (3,1)/(2,0) directly.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake (#1) is far northwest at (2,6), so no immediate collision risk from their simultaneous moves (e.g., their LEFT is into their own body, similar restriction).\n\nEvaluating safe options:\n- **UP to (9,2)**: Aligns perfectly with last turn's strategy to ascend column 9 rapidly. This progresses toward y=9 apples ((4,9), (6,9)), offering abundant open space (rows 2-9 are largely empty at x=9), multiple follow-ups (e.g., further UP to 9,3+ or LEFT/RIGHT later), and avoids self-traps. No own body blocks, and enemy is unlikely to contest immediately. Eco:Closer to high-density apples (4,9 nearish via later LEFTs), high options, low risk.\n\n- **DOWN to (9,0)**: Opens bottom access ((2,0)/(3,1) at x<4), but (9,0) has only one viable follow-up (LEFT to 8,0) before dead-ends or returning UP, creating a potential trap. Less strategically promising than UP, as mid-term enemy could pivot south.\n\nPrioritizing UP per last rationale maximizes safe growth (aim 6-7 apples by turn 35) by targeting y=9 apples first.

This would extend my lead to 6 vs 3.\n- LEFT (5,8): No apple. Puts me closer to the left side of the board.\n- RIGHT (7,8): No apple. Puts me closer to enemy snake #0.\n\n**Enemy assessment:**\nSnake #0 is at (8,4). Their possible moves (considering their body):\n- UP\u2192(8,5) their body \u274c\n- DOWN\u2192(8,3) empty \u2705\n- LEFT\u2192(7,4) empty \u2705\n- RIGHT\u2192(9,4) empty \u2705\n\nThey have 3 safe moves. They could move LEFT to (7,4) which would bring them closer, but they'd still be 3 moves away from me. I'm not in immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Future mobility after each move:**\n- **DOWN to (6,7)**: Eat apple, position is good.\n  Next turn from (6,7) with new length 7:\n    - UP\u2192(6,8) my body \u274c\n    - DOWN\u2192(6,6) empty \u25a1\n    - LEFT\u2192(5,7) empty \u25a1\n    - RIGHT\u2192(7,7) empty \u25a1\n    3 safe moves possible.\n\n- **LEFT to (5,8)**: No growth.\n  Next turn from (5,8):\n    - UP\u2192(5,9) my body \u274c\n    - DOWN\u2192(5,7) empty \u25a1\n    - LEFT\u2192(4,8) my body \u274c\n    - RIGHT\u2192(6,8) my body \u274c\n    Only 1 safe move (DOWN)! This is very risky as it's a potential dead-end.\n\n- **RIGHT to (7,8)**: No growth.\n  Next turn from (7,8):\n    - UP\u2192(7,9) empty \u25a1\n    - DOWN\u2192(7,7) empty \u25a1\n    - LEFT\u2192(6,8) my body \u274c\n    - RIGHT\u2192(8,8) empty \u25a1\n    3 safe moves possible.\n\n**Strategic decision:**\nEating the apple at (6,7) is clearly optimal. It gives me points, extends my lead, and maintains good mobility for future turns. LEFT is dangerous due to only having 1 safe move next turn. RIGHT is safe but gives no immediate benefit.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating the apple at (6,7), I'll have to assess the board but likely want to move DOWN to (6,6) or RIGHT to (7,7) to maintain central positioning and options.

Prioritizing eating the adjacent apple (LEFT) stalls y-progress toward the y=0-1 targets and slightly reduces future maneuverability after growth (snake length increases to 5, adding mild risk when navigating tight spots later), while RIGHT expands laterally away from apples. DOWN aligns with the vertical-first plan, keeping y decreasing (from current y=3 to 2, close to the y=1-2 goal in prior rationale) and supporting a later leftward west shift (e.g., to x=4 from x=8, 4 moves) for safe eats like (4,0) or (3,1), while avoiding premature commitment to x=7's potentially narrower path (though still open now). DOWN eats no apple now but preserves this high-y descent momentum with multiple viable follow-ups (DOWN again to 8,1?; LEFT to 7,2?; RIGHT to 9,2? all empty), better aligning with win conditions by staying alive, open, and pursuit-focused vs. the enemy's 6 points lead.\n\nStrategy update for next turn: Proceed DOWN to (8,3) already complete via last move; now continue vertical descent to (8,2), then (8,1) toward y=0-1 apples, prioritization (4,0) then (3,1)\u2014eat if path clear, otherwise (2,0). Hold x=8 for open options until ready to shift WEST (LEFT) post-y=1; avoid RIGHT unless necessary to dodge enemy (unlikely based on its current vertical stretch).

The last segment (4,7) is the tail for this turn.)\n- Apples remaining: (2, 0), (3, 1), (1, 6), (4, 0), (7, 3)\n- Enemy snake #0 head: (8, 3), body: [(8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6)], apples: 3\n\n**Safety check for each direction:**\n- UP: (6, 8) \u2192 my body \u274c\n- DOWN: (6, 6) \u2192 empty \u2705\n- LEFT: (5, 7) \u2192 empty \u2705\n- RIGHT: (7, 7) \u2192 empty \u2705\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Apple targeting:**\n- The apples at (7,3) and (1,6) are the closest in terms of Manhattan distance.\n- RIGHT (7,7) gets me closer to (7,3) and is 4 moves away (Down, Down, Down, Down).\n- LEFT (5,7) gets me closer to (1,6) and is 5 moves away (Left x4, Down).\n- DOWN (6,6) is not directly closer to any specific apple but opens up the central area.\n\n**Enemy assessment:**\nSnake #0 is at (8,3). Their possible moves:\n- UP\u2192(8,4) their body \u274c\n- DOWN\u2192(8,2) empty \u2705\n- LEFT\u2192(7,3) contains apple! \u2705\n- RIGHT\u2192(9,3) empty \u2705\n\nThey have 3 safe moves. The most likely move for them is LEFT to (7,3) to eat the apple. This would put their head at (7,3). This is important because if I go RIGHT to (7,7), and then plan to go DOWN, I could potentially run into them in 2-3 turns. However, since we move simultaneously, a head-on collision this turn is impossible from my current position.\n\n**Future mobility analysis from each safe move:**\n- **DOWN to (6,6):**\n    Next turn from (6,6):\n    - UP\u2192(6,7) my body \u274c\n    - DOWN\u2192(6,5) empty \u2705\n    - LEFT\u2192(5,6) empty \u2705\n    - RIGHT\u2192(7,6) empty \u2705\n    -> 3 safe moves. Good.\n\n- **LEFT to (5,7):**\n    Next turn from (5,7):\n    - UP\u2192(5,8) my body \u274c\n    - DOWN\u2192(5,6) empty \u2705\n    - LEFT\u2192(4,7) my body \u274c\n    - RIGHT\u2192(6,7) my body \u274c\n    -> Only 1 safe move (DOWN)! This is a trap. **ELIMINATE LEFT.**\n\n- **RIGHT to (7,7):**\n    Next turn from (7,7):\n    - UP\u2192(7,8) empty \u2705\n    - DOWN\u2192(7,6) empty \u2705\n    - LEFT\u2192(6,7) my body \u274c\n    - RIGHT\u2192(8,7) empty \u2705\n    -> 3 safe moves. Good.\n\n**Strategic decision:**\nLEFT is immediately eliminated due to poor future mobility. The choice is between DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n- **DOWN (6,6)** moves me away from the enemy and keeps options open in the central/southern part of the board. It's a very safe, consolidating move.\n- **RIGHT (7,7)** moves me towards the cluster of apples ((7,3)) and the enemy. This is more aggressive. The enemy is likely to move to (7,3) this turn, so they will be just south of me. This could lead to a confrontation, but also an opportunity to potentially trap them if I'm careful.\n\nGiven my significant lead (6 apples vs 3), the safer play is to consolidate and avoid unnecessary risks near the enemy. I should focus on controlling space and picking up the more isolated apples.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After moving DOWN to (6,6), I can assess moving towards the apple at (4,0) or (1,6), keeping my distance from snake #0. Maintain central control and let the enemy possibly make a mistake.\n\nDOWN",

However, the enemy snake #0 is at (8, 2) and their most likely move is towards the apple at (7, 3) (LEFT to (7, 2)), putting them in direct competition.\n- Given my lead (6 apples vs 3), a cautious approach is better. I should avoid a potential confrontation near (7, 3) and target the less contested apples.\n- Moving DOWN positions me well to go towards (4, 0) or (1, 6) next, areas further from the enemy.\n\n**Strategic decision:**\nRIGHT offers good mobility but moves me towards the enemy's probable path. LEFT offers only 2 future moves and feels constricting. DOWN offers good mobility and moves me towards safe, uncontested apples. It's the most strategic choice to maintain my lead and control.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After DOWN to (6, 5), assess moving LEFT/DOWN towards the apple at (4, 0). Keep the enemy on the opposite side of the board. Prioritize safety and map control.\n\nDOWN",

That's not possible here because enemy is at (6, 1) and I'm at (4, 3) \u2014 no overlap possible.  \n\nSo no immediate head-on risk.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**\n\n- **DOWN to (4, 2)**:  \n  Next turn from (4, 2):  \n  UP \u2192 (4, 3) (empty? no, that's my old head position? Wait, my body will move with me, so (4, 3) becomes my neck, so it's occupied by my body next turn) \u2192 \u274c  \n  DOWN \u2192 (4, 1) empty \u2705  \n  LEFT \u2192 (3, 2) empty \u2705  \n  RIGHT \u2192 (5, 2) empty \u2705  \n  \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n- **LEFT to (3, 3)**:  \n  Next turn from (3, 3):  \n  UP \u2192 (3, 4) empty \u2705  \n  DOWN \u2192 (3, 2) empty \u2705  \n  LEFT \u2192 (2, 3) empty \u2705  \n  RIGHT \u2192 (4, 3) my body \u274c  \n  \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n- **RIGHT to (5, 3)**:  \n  Next turn from (5, 3):  \n  UP \u2192 (5, 4) my body \u274c  \n  DOWN \u2192 (5, 2) empty \u2705  \n  LEFT \u2192 (4, 3) my body \u274c  \n  RIGHT \u2192 (6, 3) enemy body \u274c  \n  \u2192 only 1 safe move (DOWN) \u2014 very bad.  \n  So \u274c avoid RIGHT.\n\nSo safe moves with good mobility: DOWN, LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple targeting:**\n\nApples: (2, 0), (3, 1), (1, 6), (4, 0), (6, 0).  \n\nFrom (4, 3):  \n- DOWN to (4, 2) gets me closer to (4, 0) and (3, 1).  \n- LEFT to (3, 3) gets me closer to (2, 0) and (3, 1) but slightly less direct than DOWN for (4, 0).  \n\n(4, 0) is 2 steps away if I go DOWN then DOWN again.  \n(3, 1) is 2 steps away if I go DOWN then LEFT.  \n\nEnemy is at (6, 1) and might go to (6, 0) to eat that apple. If I go DOWN, I can aim for (4, 0) and (3, 1) while enemy takes (6, 0).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid enemy path:**\n\nEnemy could go to (5, 1) or (6, 0). If it goes to (5, 1), it's closer to (4, 0) next turn. But I can still reach (4, 0) first if I go DOWN now and DOWN again next turn.  \n\nLEFT is safer from enemy but moves away from some apples except (2, 0).  \n\nGiven my score lead (7 vs 4), I should play safe but also collect apples to extend lead. DOWN seems better for apple gathering.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Final choice:**\n\nDOWN is safe, good mobility, leads toward apples, and avoids enemy's immediate path.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**  \nHead toward (4, 0) then (3, 1) or (2, 0). Avoid getting trapped near enemy; keep enemy on opposite side of board. Use left side for safety.\n\nDOWN",

UP to (5,3) temporarily regains space upward, but prioritizing RIGHT aligns with last plan for untrapping and rightward progress.\n\nUpcoming strategy note: Pursue RIGHTward expansion to x=7-8 in rows 1-2, aiming for apples at (7,0) or (8,1) via paths like (6,2) -> (7,2) -> (7,1) -> (7,0) or onto (8,1). Watch enemy #1 (head at 1,2), who may target (2,0) or (8,1)\u2014intercept defensively if they head right. Expand mobility to row 4+ if space permits, avoiding x=4 conflicts. Apples goal: Bridge 8-apples gap before turn 150.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nSafe moves from (6,2): LEFT invalid (into own body at (5,2), the cell directly behind head); RIGHT to (7,2); UP to (6,3); DOWN to (6,1). RIGHT and UP offer multiple follow-up options, while DOWN leads to more restricted space after the next move (only RIGHT open from (6,1)). RIGHT advances toward apples at (7,0) or (8,1) without entering likely collision paths with enemy head at (1,3), who may head right. UP moves up toward open space but away from apples and closer to potential enemy pressure.\n\nUpcoming strategy note: Continue RIGHT to positions x=7-8, targeting apples at (7,0) via (6,2)->(7,2)->(7,1)->(7,0) or at (8,1) via (7,2)->(8,2)->(8,1). If enemy heads right (e.g., toward x=4-8), adjust to block or deflect; otherwise, prefer RIGHT to maintain open moves and apple pursuits, aiming to close the apples gap to under 2 before turn 50.\n\nRIGHT",

Let's check:  \nFrom (3,6):  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4,6) \u2192 then DOWN \u2192 (4,5) \u2192 then LEFT/RIGHT to apple: total 3 moves to (5,5) or (6,5)? Actually Manhattan: (3,6) to (5,5) = 3 moves? Let's check: (3,6)\u2192(4,6)\u2192(5,6)\u2192(5,5) = 3 moves.  \nDOWN \u2192 (3,5)\u2192(4,5)\u2192(5,5) = 2 moves to (5,5). So DOWN is shortest path to apple (5,5).\n\nMobility check after each move:  \n- UP (3, 7): next turn UP (3, 8) empty \u2705, DOWN (3, 6) empty \u2705, LEFT (2, 7) empty \u2705, RIGHT (4, 7) empty \u2705 \u2192 4 safe moves \u2014 good.  \n- DOWN (3, 5): next turn UP (3, 6) empty \u2705, DOWN (3, 4) empty \u2705, LEFT (2, 5) my body \u274c, RIGHT (4, 5) empty \u2705 \u2192 3 safe moves \u2014 less due to body.  \n- RIGHT (4, 6): next turn UP (4, 7) empty \u2705, DOWN (4, 5) empty \u2705, LEFT (3, 6) empty \u2705, RIGHT (5, 6) empty \u2705 \u2192 4 safe moves \u2014 good.  \n\nRIGHT and UP both have high mobility; DOWN has less but gets apple faster.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Avoiding enemy**  \nEnemy at (7,0) going LEFT or RIGHT \u2014 no immediate threat to me.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nDOWN gets me to (5,5) fastest, but reduces mobility next turn because left is blocked by my body.  \nRIGHT keeps options open and still progresses toward apples.  \nSince I'm ahead in apples (9 vs 8), maybe prioritize safety over speed.  \nRIGHT seems balanced: good mobility, progress toward apples.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After RIGHT, consider DOWN toward (5,5) if safe, or continue toward (6,5). Keep an eye on enemy #0 moving along bottom edge.\n\nRIGHT\n\n**Final move:**  \nRIGHT",

RIGHT opens more space on right side. DOWN also okay but might push me toward bottom edge.

Not eating this turn (by going UP to (3,1)) keeps similar immediate mobility but delays scoring without clear benefit, as the apple remains reachable but farther away downstream. Overall, this move safely advances scoring without closing off recovery or future options against a stronger enemy.\n\nShort plan for next turns: Eat the (2,0) apple this turn for 9 apples, then move UP to (2,1) to escape the corner and open vertical paths toward (2,8) or lateral shifts toward (8,3).

Body: [(6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6)].\n\nCheck moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 2): empty \u2705 safe  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 0): empty \u2705 safe  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 1): empty \u2705 safe  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 1): my body \u274c unsafe  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy snake #0 head at (4, 4)**  \nEnemy body: [(4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)].\n\nEnemy\u2019s possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 5): empty \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 3): body \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 4): empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 4): empty \u2705  \n\nEnemy can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nManhattan distance from my head (5,1) to enemy head (4,4) = 4.  \nNo immediate head-on collision risk this turn because enemy can\u2019t reach my possible moves in one step except possibly (5,0) if I go DOWN and enemy goes RIGHT to (5,4) \u2014 not collision. Wait, check: enemy RIGHT to (5,4), I DOWN to (5,0) \u2192 no collision. So no immediate danger.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apples**  \nApples: (3, 9), (9, 9), (2, 8), (9, 7), (3, 8).  \nClosest apple is (3,8) \u2014 distance 7 units away.  \nMoving UP or LEFT gets me closer to apples in the top-left area.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Mobility after each safe move**  \n- UP (5,2): next turn UP (5,3) empty \u2705, DOWN (5,1) body \u274c, LEFT (4,2) empty \u2705, RIGHT (6,2) body \u274c \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n- DOWN (5,0): next turn UP (5,1) body \u274c, DOWN (5,-1) off board \u274c, LEFT (4,0) empty \u2705, RIGHT (6,0) empty \u2705 \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n- LEFT (4,1): next turn UP (4,2) empty \u2705, DOWN (4,0) empty \u2705, LEFT (3,1) empty \u2705, RIGHT (5,1) body \u274c \u2192 3 safe moves.\n\nLEFT gives best mobility next turn (3 moves). UP and DOWN give only 2 moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term positioning**  \nMy body blocks the right side. Moving LEFT toward (4,1) opens paths toward apples (3,8) and (2,8) and avoids trapping myself.  \nEnemy at (4,4) is not in my immediate vicinity, so moving LEFT is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid dead-ends**  \nUP and DOWN both reduce future options. LEFT keeps more options open.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter going LEFT to (4,1), next turn I can go UP to (4,2) or LEFT to (3,1) to approach apples while keeping mobility high. Avoid moving toward enemy unless necessary.\n\nLEFT",

UP to (3,5) offers 3 follow-ups (UP 3,6, LEFT 2,5, RIGHT 4,5), good. LEFT to (2,4) offers 3 (UP 2,5, DOWN 2,3, LEFT 1,4), also good. Both UP and LEFT move closer to apples ((2,8),(3,8),(3,9)) in the left space with fewer enemy parts. Per last plan, prioritize the LEFT path to x=2/3 for easier apple access; LEFT first keeps more separation from enemy. No obvious traps, and LEFT aligns with strategy to stay left and loop if needed.\n\nLong-term plan for next few turns: From (2,4), go UP to (2,5) then further to reach (2,8); if (2,8) eaten or enemy interfered, pivot to x=3 path via DOWN or RIGHT to aim for (3,8)/(3,9). Keep monitoring enemy (likely moving UP from (3,1) next), maintain distance, revert to LEFT loops if center/right gets congested.\n\nLEFT",
