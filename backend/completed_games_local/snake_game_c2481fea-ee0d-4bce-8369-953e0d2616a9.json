However, moving RIGHT toward the cluster at (8, 4), (8, 6), and (7, 7) puts me in a area with more resources further away from the enemy.

Its distance to (3, 2) is only 2 steps. It will likely take that apple.\n\nThe apple at (8, 4) is the most efficient target for me. It is 3 steps away, and I am already oriented toward it. Once I secure (8, 4), I will be perfectly positioned to move up to (8, 6) and (7, 7).\n\n**3. Long-term Plan:**\nProceed RIGHT to collect (8, 4). Then evaluate between chasing (8, 6) or dropping down for (7, 1) depending on Snake #1's growth and position. Currently, Snake #1 is too far away to contest the right-side cluster.\n\nRIGHT",

Note: They just ate the apple that was at (7, 1).\n*   **Apples:** (9, 9), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 8), (8, 8).\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1.  **UP (8, 3):** **Invalid**. This is moving backwards into my body.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 1):** **Safe**. This moves me closer to the bottom edge. Snake #1's head is at (7, 1). If they move RIGHT, we could have a head-on collision at (8, 1). This is risky.\n3.  **LEFT (7, 2):** **Safe**. This moves me between my body and the enemy body. However, Snake #1's head is at (7, 1). If they move UP, we would have a head-on collision at (7, 2). This is also risky.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 2):** **Safe**. This moves me toward the right wall, away from Snake #1. This is the safest move to avoid a head-on collision.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Snake #1 is very close (distance 2). Since we are currently tied/close in score and the game is relatively early, avoiding a 50/50 head-on collision is more important than contesting the immediate space.\n- Moving RIGHT to (9, 2) provides a buffer. From (9, 2), I can move UP toward the apples at (8, 8) and (9, 9).\n- Snake #1 just grew, so their tail will not move this turn, but they are relatively short.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to create distance from Snake #1 and avoid a potential head-on collision at (8, 1) or (7, 2). After reaching the wall, I will head UP along the right edge toward the apples at the top right of the board ((8, 8) and (9, 9)).

Body is [(7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (4, 2)].\n*   **Apples:** (9, 9), (8, 8), (1, 7), (1, 5), (2, 8).\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1.  **UP (9, 4):** **Safe**. This continues my path along the right wall toward (9, 9) and (8, 8). Snake #1 is at (6, 2) and cannot reach (9, 4) this turn. \n2.  **DOWN (9, 3) -> (9, 2):** **Invalid**. This is moving backwards into my neck.\n3.  **LEFT (8, 3):** **Invalid**. This is moving into my own body.\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 3):** **Invalid**. Off the board.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Only one legal move exists: UP.\n- Moving UP allows me to bypass the cluster formed by my body and Snake #1's body at y=1 to y=3.\n- Snake #1 is currently somewhat constrained near the middle-bottom. By moving UP, I maintain control of the right side of the board.\n- The next targets are (8, 8) and (9, 9). \n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nProceed strictly UP the x=9 column. This keeps me away from Snake #1 and leads directly to two apples. Once at the top, I can evaluate whether to grab (9, 9) or pivot left for (8, 8) depending on Snake #1's progress.\n\nUP",

Let me verify:\n\n- UP to (6, 3): Enemy body is at (6, 3) - **DEADLY**\n- DOWN to (6, 1): My body is at (6, 1) - **DEADLY**\n- RIGHT to (7, 2): My body is at (7, 2) - **DEADLY**\n- LEFT to (5, 2): Enemy body is at (5, 2) - **DEADLY**\n\n### Enemy Snake Analysis\nEnemy at (9, 3) can move to:\n- UP (9, 4): Safe\n- DOWN (9, 2): Safe\n- RIGHT (10, 3): **DEADLY** (off board)\n- LEFT (8, 3): Safe\n\n### Strategy Note\nI am in a deadly situation with no safe moves available. The enemy snake is positioned to block my movement paths and has created a wall of bodies around my head. This appears to be a trap where the enemy has maneuvered me into a position with no escape.\n\nThe only potential hope would be if the enemy snake moves out of one of the blocking positions this turn, but even then I would need to predict their movement correctly. Given the current board state, any move I make will result in death.\n\n**Plan**: This appears to be a no-win situation. The enemy has successfully trapped me. I will need to accept that this move will result in death.\n\nLEFT",
