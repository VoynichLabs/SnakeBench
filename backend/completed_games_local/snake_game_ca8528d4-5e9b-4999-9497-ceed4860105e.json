With most apples concentrated in the upper right quadrant, I have excellent opportunities to continue growing. After eating the apple at (8,7), my body will grow to include (7,8) and (6,8), giving me more strategic options.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Continue aggressive food collection by moving DOWN to eat the apple at (8,7). This maintains my growth momentum and keeps me in the apple-rich area. After this move, I'll have clear paths to other nearby apples at (4,7) and potentially (2,7) depending on my position. Watch for body management as I grow longer.\n\nDOWN",

That would be dangerous, leading to collision with the enemy's tail, which is about to be vacated, so perhaps safe to move into that cell if the enemy is moving away? But in the rules, moving into a cell occupied by any snake's body (including the tail) results in death unless the tail is moving away simultaneously. The tail at (7,7) is about to move away since the enemy's head is at (5,7) and segments behind, so (7,7) is likely vacated this turn if the enemy moves forward. But as the enemy's head is at (5,7) with several segments behind, their move likely doesn't directly affect (7,7). For safety, move into (7,7) might be risky unless certain the tail is moving away. Need to assess enemy movement:\n\n  - Enemy's head at (5,7), with body at (6,7), (7,7).  \n  - Enemy may choose to move UP (to (5,8)), DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Since the opponent's tail is at (7,7), and they have extensions beyond it, they might move away or stay. To avoid assuming their move, perhaps safest to avoid (7,7) for now.\n\n- DOWN to (7,5): This is two tiles below our head and seems fairly safe and closer to apple at (4,4), but moving down would take us away from immediate apple opportunities and to the lower side.\n\n- LEFT to (6,6): Moving left would put us closer to apples at (6,6) (which is the apple at (6,6)), but that apple isn't currently on the board: wait, the apple at (6,6) exists, so moving left puts us directly onto it if we move to (6,6). That's advantageous as it would grow our snake and increase score. Also, (6,6) isn't occupied by any other snake.\n\n- RIGHT to (8,6): Moving right takes us away from apples and closer to boundaries.\n\nAssessing movement options:\n\n- UP: risky due to possible collision with enemy tail or head \u2014 but the enemy's body positions suggest (7,6) is open if the tail moves away, which it may if the enemy moves their head. Moving into (7,7) could be risky if tail vacates or not; more cautious to avoid that.\n\n- DOWN: safe and moves us closer to apple at (4,4), but perhaps less optimal compared to other options near valuable apples.\n\n- LEFT: directly onto apple at (6,6) \u2014 excellent for scoring, safe move, and keeps us away from danger.\n\n- RIGHT: less beneficial, moving away from apples and closer to boundary.\n\nGiven the above, the most promising move seems to be LEFT: moving into (6,6) to eat the apple there. It is safe, immediate, and potentially opens up more space.\n\nBefore finalizing, let's confirm safety:\n\n- Cell (6,6): unoccupied.  \n- Our tail will stay in (7,6) unless we move onto another cell.  \n- No collision with enemy snake's current position at (5,7) or segments behind.  \n- Moving into (6,6) helps us grow and accumulate points.\n\nOn the downside, moving left slightly diversifies our path, reduces risk of collision, and gains us an apple.\n\nThus, I decide to go LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

More likely it will move LEFT to (6,6) toward the apple, or DOWN/UP to safer spaces.\n\n**Best path forward:** DOWN to (4,6) seems optimal. It moves me toward the apple at (4,4) while keeping me away from the enemy. It also gives me good mobility - from (4,6) I can go LEFT toward other apples or continue DOWN. UP would take me away from the dense apple cluster. LEFT is reasonable but puts me closer to the edge.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Move DOWN to (4,6) to pursue the apple at (4,4).
