Safe empty, but meh, no gains. LEFT to (8,0)? APPLE BABY! \ud83c\udf4f Eat, grow to 2, +1 score, and line up for (7,0) apple next? That's a DOUBLE DIP setup! Enemy can't touch (8,0) this turn\u2014too far, their moves stay mid-board. No collisions, no traps. Perfect aggression! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\ude80\n\nWhy LEFT over UP?

HIM. \ud83d\ude08\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Sweep bottom apples LEFT to (8,0) -> (7,0) -> scout (5,0), grow to 4+ quick. Watch enemy path from (4,3), cut off their apple runs (like (3,5) or (2,4)).

Apples EVERYWHERE, but we gotta play SMART! \ud83e\udde0\n\nFirst, let's check our immediate moves. From (4,3):\n- UP \ud83e\udc45 to (4,4) \u2013 Looks clear? No snakes, no walls. Apple at (3,5) is tempting\u2026\n- DOWN \ud83e\udc47 to (4,2) \u2013 Also clear? No immediate threats.\n- LEFT \ud83e\udc44 to (3,3) \u2013 Clear? Seems safe.\n- RIGHT \ud83e\udc46 to (5,3) \u2013 Clear? But enemy is far right, so probably safe.\n\nWAIT! \ud83d\ude30 Are any of these suicide? Let's eliminate:\n- None go off board (all within 0-9).\n- No body segments (we're just a head!).\n- No immediate collision with enemy body (they also have no body).\n\nSO ALL MOVES ARE SAFE? \ud83d\ude0e But we gotta think about the ENEMY! They're at (9,0). What might THEY do? They might go LEFT to (8,0) for that apple? Or UP to (9,1)? They have apples at (7,0), (8,0), (9,3) nearby? But we're far apart for now.\n\nBut long-term? We wanna BOX THEM IN! \ud83e\udd4a They're in the bottom-right corner. If we can control the center and left, we can trap them! Also, apples on the left side: (0,6), (0,0), (1,6), (0,8), (0,4), (1,7) \u2013 that's a buffet! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nSo which move sets us up for that?\n- UP to (4,4) \u2013 gets us closer to center and apples like (3,5).\n- DOWN to (4,2) \u2013 still okay, but fewer apples down?\n- LEFT to (3,3) \u2013 moves us left toward the apple cluster! \ud83d\ude0b\n- RIGHT to (5,3) \u2013 moves us right, but that might push us toward enemy territory? Not ideal.\n\nLEFT us toward the left-side apple paradise and away from the enemy. Also, it keeps options open: from (3,3), we can go UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT still.\n\nBut what about apples? The closest apples are at (0,4) and (0,6) and (1,6) \u2013 left and up! So LEFT then UP later could be a plan.\n\nAlso, enemy is at (9,0) \u2013 they might be distracted by apples on their side. We can sneak and grab all the left apples! \ud83c\udfc3\ud83d\udca8\n\nSo my move: LEFT to (3,3)! Then next turn, we can go UP toward (3,4) or (3,5) for that apple? Or further left? Let's not get greedy \u2013 one step at a time!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (for future me): \nMove left to dominate the left side and gobble apples. Avoid moving right toward enemy unless necessary. Watch for enemy trying to cut us off? But they're far. We can maybe trap them in the corner later by controlling the center and right? But for now, LEFT IS BEST! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

Our rival, Snake #1, is chilling at (8,0) with a body at (9,0) and one apple already. We gotta catch up!\n\nFirst, check our options from our new head at (3,3):\n- **UP \ud83e\udc45 to (3,4)**: That space is empty! Looks clear, no snakes, no walls. A step closer to the apple cluster on the top-left!\n- **DOWN \ud83e\udc47 to (3,2)**: Also empty! Safe move, but takes us further from the main apple buffet. Might be a bit passive.\n- **LEFT \ud83e\udc44 to (2,3)**: Moves us left, deeper into our territory! Still clear, no obstructions.\n- **RIGHT \ud83e\udc46 to (4,3)**: Back where we just came from? \ud83e\udd14 That space should be empty since we just left it. But is moving backwards the best play? Probably not strategically.\n\nAll moves are SAFE? \ud83d\ude0e Let's confirm:\n- No going off the board (all coordinates 0-9 are valid).\n- No body segments (we're still just a head!).\n- No enemy bodies in any of these cells (their body is at (9,0), far away).\n\nBUT WAIT! \ud83e\udd2f What about the enemy's NEXT move? Their head is at (8,0). They could go UP to (8,1), LEFT to (7,0) (which has an apple! \ud83c\udf4e), or even DOWN? But DOWN is off the board (y= -1), so not allowed. So they'll likely go LEFT or UP. They might grab that apple at (7,0) and grow! We need to secure our own apples FAST.\n\nWhere are the closest apples? Looking at the list: (0,6), (2,4), (0,0), (1,6), (0,8), (3,5), (1,7), (0,4)... HOLY COW, the left side is LOADED! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nSo which move gets us closer to the apple jackpot?\n- UP to (3,4): Puts us one step closer to (3,5) which has an apple! Also sets us up to go further up to (2,4) or (1,6), etc.\n- LEFT to (2,3): Moves us left, but the nearest apples are above us (like (2,4) is at y=4, we're at y=3). So we'd need to go up next.\n- DOWN or RIGHT: Don't help us get to the apples as directly.\n\nUP seems BEST! We can grab (3,5) next turn if we go up now! Then we can continue upwards to (2,4) or left to (1,6)? So many options!\n\nAlso, long-term plan: DOMINATE THE LEFT SIDE! \ud83d\ude80 Grab all those apples, grow big, and then we can start boxing in the enemy who's stuck in the bottom-right. They might be distracted by the apples on their side (like (7,0), (7,1), (8,4), etc.), so we can build a massive lead!\n\nSo let's go UP! Get that content! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

Enemy noob still a pathetic length 1 at (3,4), zero eats, surrounded by apples but WE'RE the ones feastin'! Bottom row loaded: (5,0),(4,0) ripe for the sweep, and (7,1) starin' me RIGHT in the face! Time to FATTER UP and BOX this scrub in! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80 Who's hyped for length 4?! \n\n**QUICK SCAN ALL MOVES\u2014NO SUICIDE PLAYS:**\n- **DOWN**: (7,-1)? OFF-BOARD YEET. Instant RIP. \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udca5\n- **RIGHT**: (8,0)\u2014my own neck! Self-sabotage, DEAD on arrival. DumbAF. \u274c\ud83d\udc0d\n- **LEFT**: (6,0)\u2014empty safe spot, no apple. Length stays 3: new head (6,0), tail pulls from (9,0) to body [(6,0),(7,0),(8,0)]. Options open left/down-ish, but NO GROW?

Enemy clown at (3,4) can't touch it (their moves: LEFT(2,4)A, RIGHT(4,4)., UP(3,5)A, DOWN(3,3).\u2014nowhere near col7 row1). Clutch!\n\nSAFE MOVES: LEFT (safe but meh) vs UP (EAT & GROW \ud83d\udd25). UP DOMINATES\u2014score to 3, body walls off bottom-right harder, forces enemy north detour while I chain feasts. LEFT leaves apple on table? Nah, we SNATCH!\n\nEnemy schemes? Probably LEFT to (2,4)A or UP to (3,5)A\u2014grow to 2 maybe, but WE outpace 'em 3-1 already. They chase mid-board snacks, I own the south! No head-on risk, distance too big.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Eat (7,1) -> sweep LEFT to (6,1) empty or snake LEFT/DOWN to trap bottom apples (5,0)/(4,0)\u2014length 5+ fast. Coil body to block enemy south paths, grow massive, encircle their head for crash. If they north, steal (8,4)A later. UNSTOPPABLE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83e\udeb1\ud83e\uddc0\n\nUP",

Just moved UP, a POWER MOVE to get us closer to that sweet, sweet content! \ud83c\udf4e But our rival is already at 2 apples, we can't let them get further ahead!\n\nWhere we at? Head at (3,4). Our options are:\n- **UP \ud83e\udc45 to (3,5)**: DING DING DING! APPLE ALERT! \ud83c\udf4e That's a free point! But is it safe? Let's check for enemy heads about to move there...\n- **DOWN \ud83e\udc47 to (3,3)**: Just came from there! It's empty, but moving back is a bit of a weak play when an apple is RIGHT THERE.\n- **LEFT \ud83e\udc44 to (2,4)**: Also an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e But wait, is someone else gunning for it? And is it the better play?\n- **RIGHT \ud83e\udc46 to (4,4)**: Empty space. But it moves us away from the left-side apple buffet.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK:**\n*   UP: (3,5) has an apple, not a body. But could Snake #1's head get there? Their head is at (7,0). They can't reach us in one move, they're miles away! SAFE.\n*   DOWN: (3,3) is empty. SAFE.\n*   LEFT: (2,4) has an apple. SAFE.\n*   RIGHT: (4,4) is empty. SAFE.\n\nOK FAM, all moves are safe from immediate suicide! But which one gets us the BIGGEST ADVANTAGE? \ud83e\udd14\n\n**THE APPLE CONUNDRUM:**\nWe have TWO apples we can grab in one move: (3,5) UP and (2,4) LEFT! SO. MUCH. CONTENT. The board is LOADED on the left! But which one to take?\n\nLet's think about our **OPPONENT** \ud83d\udc0d Their head is at (7,0) with body at (8,0) and (9,0). What can they do? They can go:\n- UP to (7,1) -> ANOTHER APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e They'll grab it and grow to 3 apples!\n- LEFT to (6,0) -> Empty, but no apple.\n- They can't go RIGHT (off board) or DOWN (off board).\n\nSO THEY ARE 100% GOING FOR THAT APPLE AT (7,1)! They're gonna get BIGGER! We NEED to secure our points NOW!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY & FUTURE PROOFING:**\nGrabbing the apple at (3,5) (UP) puts our new head right on (3,5). From there, our next moves could be UP to (3,6), DOWN (back to (3,4)), LEFT to (2,5), or RIGHT to (4,5). That's 3 new options (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Very open!\n\nGrabbing the apple at (2,4) (LEFT) puts our new head on (2,4). From there, we could go UP to (2,5), DOWN to (2,3), LEFT to (1,4), or RIGHT (back to (3,4)). Also 3 new options! Also solid!\n\nSO BOTH APPLE MOVES ARE EQUALLY GOOD FOR FUTURE OPTIONS! But which one puts us on a better path? The cluster of apples is all over the left: (0,6), (1,6), (0,8), (1,7), (0,4)... Going UP to (3,5) feels like it opens up the top-left corner MORE. It's the more aggressive, forward-thinking play!\n\n**THE VERDICT:**\nWe're going for the apple UP at (3,5)! It secures our first point, keeps our future wide open, and continues our push to DOMINATE the left side of the map! We can't let the enemy's growth scare us \u2013 we just need to start our own snowball! LET'S GET THIS BREAD! \ud83c\udf5e\n\nUP",

Looks clear! But is there a future there?\n**DOWN \ud83e\udc47 to (3,4):** That's our own body! \ud83d\ude35 INSTANT DEATH! CANNOT GO DOWN!\n**LEFT \ud83e\udc44 to (2,5):** ALSO empty! And it puts us closer to ALL THOSE APPLES on the left!\n**RIGHT \ud83e\udc46 to (4,5):** Another empty space... but that moves us away from the action!\n\nSO DOWN IS IMMEDIATELY OUT! WE'RE NOT TRYING TO DIE TODAY! Let's check the other three.\n\nSAFETY CHECK ON THE SAFE MOVES:\n*   **UP (3,6):** Not off board, not our body, not the opponent's body.

SAFE.\n\nOKAY, ALL POTENTIAL MOVES SEEM SAFE FROM *IMMEDIATE* DEATH. BUT WE GOTTA THINK ABOUT THE ENEMY! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nOUR RIVAL SNAKE #1:\n*   Head at (7,1). Body at (7,0), (8,0), (9,0).\n*   They JUST ATE THE APPLE AT (7,1) last turn! So their head is now at (7,1) and they grew a segment. Their new body segment is at their old head position, (7,0). So their current full body is now: [(7,1), (7,0), (8,0), (9,0)].\n*   From (7,1), where can they go?\n    *   UP to (7,2): Empty. No apple.\n    *   DOWN to (7,0): That's their own neck/body! \ud83d\ude35 They'd die! They are NOT going to do that.\n    *   LEFT to (6,1): Empty! No apple.\n    *   RIGHT to (8,1): Empty! No apple.\n\nSO THEY HAVE THREE SAFE MOVES: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. They are gonna try to get to more apples, probably the cluster at the top! They are a THREAT!\n\nNOW, STRATEGY TIME! We want to box them in! We also want apples! The BIGGEST cluster of apples is on the LEFT and TOP-LEFT! Look at all those A's! (0,6), (1,6), (0,8), (1,7), (0,4)... SO MUCH CONTENT! \ud83e\udd24\n\nGoing **LEFT** to (2,5) puts us DIRECTLY in the path to claim that territory! From (2,5), next turn we could go UP to (2,6) towards (1,6) and (0,6), or LEFT to (1,5), or even DOWN to (2,4) (which has an apple! but we'd have to loop back). This feels AGGRESSIVE! We are taking control of our side of the map!\n\nGoing **UP** to (3,6) is also a solid move, keeping us in the middle and giving us options to go left/right/up next turn. But is it as powerful as claiming the left flank?\n\nGoing **RIGHT** to (4,5) moves us AWAY from the apple buffet. That seems like a weaker, more defensive play. We are here to WIN, not to hide! \u274c\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nLet's start claiming the left side! We can cut off the board and force the opponent into a smaller space. They are stuck on the bottom-right for now. If we dominate the left, we can eventually trap them against the wall! We need to be AGGRESSIVE and go where the points are!\n\nLEFT is the play, chat! It secures our path to multiple apples and starts our plan to BOX IN THE ENEMY! \ud83e\udd4a\n\nLEFT",

Our rival is sitting pretty with 3 apples, but we're about to start our DOMINATION of the left side! We gotta execute the plan!\n\nFirst, let's assess the NEW BOARD STATE! Our head is at (2,5). Our body is at (3,5). We have ONE apple. Snake #1's head is at (6,1), body at [(7,1), (7,0), (8,0)]. Apples: 3.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK! WHAT MOVES KILL US? \ud83d\udea8**\n\n*   **UP \ud83e\udc45 to (2,6):** Empty space! Looks clear! SAFE.\n*   **DOWN \ud83e\udc47 to (2,4):** WHOA! That's an APPLE at (2,4)! \ud83c\udf4e But is it safe? We'd be moving onto the apple. It's not a body part. SAFE! (AND DELICIOUS!)\n*   **LEFT \ud83e\udc44 to (1,5):** Empty space! SAFE.\n*   **RIGHT \ud83e\udc46 to (3,5):** OUR OWN BODY! \ud83d\ude35 INSTANT CLIP! That's where our tail JUST WAS! CANNOT GO RIGHT! \u274c DEATH MOVE!\n\nOkay, so RIGHT is immediately out! We have three valid moves: UP, DOWN (to the apple!), and LEFT.\n\n**NOW, ENEMY PREDICTION! WHERE IS SNAKE #1 GOING? \ud83d\udc0d**\nThey are at (6,1). Their possible moves:\n*   UP to (6,2): Empty.\n*   DOWN to (6,0): Empty.\n*   LEFT to (5,1): Empty AND has an APPLE at (5,0) nearby! Very tempting!\n*   RIGHT to (7,1): Their own neck/body! DEATH. \u274c\n\nSo they have UP, DOWN, or LEFT. That APPLE at (5,0) is a huge lure for them. I predict they go LEFT towards it! They want to extend their lead!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN & OUR BEST MOVE!**\nWe are on the left side! Our plan is to CONTROL THIS TERRITORY and feast on the apple buffet! We have apples at (2,4) DOWN, (0,4) further down, (0,6) and (1,6) up, and (1,7) even higher!\n\n*   **DOWN (to (2,4)):** This gets us an APPLE IMMEDIATELY! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcc8 This closes the gap to 2 vs 3 apples! It's aggressive and gets us points! But from (2,4), our next moves? We could go LEFT to (1,4), DOWN to (2,3) (another apple!), or... UP back to (2,5). But going RIGHT to (3,4) is also safe. This gives us options and gets us fed! This is the AGGRESSIVE PLAY!\n*   **UP (to (2,6)):** This moves us towards the apples at (1,6) and (0,6). Also a strong path! But it delays our immediate score. From (2,6), we can go LEFT to (1,6) (APPLE!), UP to (2,7), or RIGHT to (3,6). Good options.\n*   **LEFT (to (1,5)):** This moves us deeper into the left flank. From (1,5), we can go UP to (1,6) (APPLE!), DOWN to (1,4), or LEFT to (0,5). Also solid, but again, no *immediate* apple.\n\nCHAT, THE CHOICE IS CLEAR! We need to close that apple gap NOW! The apple at (2,4) is RIGHT THERE! We can't leave content on the table! Going DOWN gets us the points AND keeps us on our planned path to dominate the left side! We can loop around and collect the other apples after! LET'S GET THIS BREAD... I MEAN, APPLE! \ud83e\udd56\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** We're taking the APPLE! It's the most aggressive, point-scoring move that advances our position! WE EATIN'!\n\nDOWN",

But which one sets us up for the WIN?\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION! WHERE IS SNAKE #1 GOING? \ud83d\udc0d**\nTheir head is at (5, 0), body at [(5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,0)]. Their moves:\n*   UP to (5,1): Their own body! DEATH. \u274c\n*   DOWN \ud83e\udc47 to (5, -1): OFF THE BOARD!

They have only TWO choices LEFT or RIGHT! They will 100% go **LEFT** for that apple at (4,0)! It secures their lead and is the only logical play!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN: BOX HIM IN! \ud83d\udce6**\nOur opponent is getting stuck in the bottom-right corner! Chat, this is our moment! We need to CONTROL THE BOARD \ud83d\ude24\n*   Our left side is an APPLE BUFFET: (0,4), (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (0,8)! That's our path to POWER!\n*   Snake #1 is about to be trapped against the bottom and right walls with their long body. We need to cut off their escape!\n\n**STRATEGY FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n1.  **GO LEFT!** We need to start claiming the entire left side of the map. This does two things: it gobbles up all the apples there AND positions us to wall off the center, trapping the enemy.\n2.  **AVOID THE CENTER FOR NOW.** Going RIGHT (to 3,3) drifts us towards the enemy. We don't want a head-on collision when we're shorter. Let them rot in their corner!\n3.  **SET THE TRAP.** Once we control the left, we can slowly push right, forcing them into a smaller and smaller space until they have nowhere to go but into a wall or our body! THAT'S THE CONTENT! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nLEFT is the move! It's SAFE, it gets us closer to FIVE APPLES, and it executes our long-term plan to BOX IN THE ENEMY! This isn't just about one apple, it's about the WHOLE GAME! LET'S GO CHAT!\n\nLEFT",

We gotta assume they want to survive and might go UP to start their escape from the corner!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN: CONTINUE THE BOX-IN! \ud83d\udce6**\nOur plan is WORKING! They are stuck in the bottom-left! Our move now is CRITICAL!\n*   **GOING LEFT (0,4):** EATS THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e IMMEDIATE GROWTH! This extends our body and solidifies our control over the left wall. It's a POWER MOVE! However, it puts our head on the very edge (x=0). Next turn, our options might be more limited (can't go further left). But we'd be longer and stronger!\n*   **GOING UP (1,5):** This is a SAFE, CENTRALIZING move. It keeps us away from the walls and gives us MORE options next turn (we could go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT from there). It moves us TOWARDS the apple cluster at (0,6), (1,6), (1,7)! But it delays the feast by one turn.\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nCHAT, THIS IS TOUGH! Do we take the guaranteed apple NOW and risk being on the edge, or do we play it safe and keep our options open for an even bigger feast next turn? \ud83e\udd14\n\nLooking at the board, that apple at (0,4) is RIGHT THERE. We can't let it rot! Taking it makes us longer, which is crucial for eventually boxing in the enemy. Being on the edge isn't ideal, but we can manage it for a turn to secure the growth.

We'll control the board and pick off the apples they can't reach! This is a setup for a MAJOR power play! We're playing the long game, chat! They might be up an apple now, but we're about to have the whole map! LET'S GO!\n\nDOWN",
