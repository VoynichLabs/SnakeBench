My snake's head is at **(2,1)**, and the closest apple is at **(1,1)**, just **1 cell to the left**. Key considerations:\n\n1. **Safety Check**:  \n   - Moving **LEFT** to **(1,1)** is valid:  \n     - Not off the board.  \n     - No collision with own body (snake length = 1, no tail to collide with).  \n     - No collision with enemy snake's head or body (enemy is at **(8,5)**, far from **(1,1)**).  \n\n2. **Apple Acquisition**:  \n   - **(1,1)** contains an apple. Collecting it grants **+1 apple**, increasing my score and growing the snake to length 2. This improves future offensive/defensive capabilities.  \n\n3. **Enemy Analysis**:  \n   - The enemy snake is at **(8,5)**, ~6 cells horizontally and ~4 vertically away. They are unlikely to collide with my new position **(1,1)** in one turn. Even if they prioritize the apple at **(8,1)**, they must make multiple moves to threaten me.  \n\n4. **Long-Term Strategy**:  \n   - Eating this apple allows me to grow and position myself to pursue other apples like **(0,0)** or **(2,9)**. Delaying collection risks the apple being claimed by the enemy if they approach.  \n\n5. **Risk Assessment**:  \n   - While moving left **exposes the apple**, the enemy\u2019s distance makes it improbable they will collide with me this turn. Prioritizing food consumption over evasion is necessary for growth.  \n\n**Move Justification**:  \nLEFT is the safest and most strategic choice. It guarantees apple collection, growth, and positional advantage for future turns, while enemy proximity remains negligible.  \n\n**Final move:** LEFT",

I need to choose the most strategic move:\n\n- UP: Moves to (8, 3), getting further away from the apple at (8, 1)\n- DOWN: Moves to (8, 1), which is an apple position - this would let me eat the apple\n- LEFT: Moves to (7, 2), not particularly close to any apple\n- RIGHT: Moves to (9, 2), not particularly close to any apple\n\nThe apple at (8, 1) is directly below my current position, making DOWN the obvious choice.

Moving LEFT aligns us horizontally with this apple and reduces the distance to it. This move is safe: it stays on the board, avoids collisions with our body (we are moving to a new cell not occupied by any body segment), and does not intersect with the enemy snake's position ([(7,5), (7,4), (7,3)]).\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (2,3), our body becomes [(2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,2)] (tail at (4,2) is dropped). Next turn, we will move LEFT again to (1,3), then LEFT to (0,3) to collect the apple and grow to size 5. This positions us to potentially pursue the remaining apple at row 9 while the enemy snake is likely occupied elsewhere.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Collect the apple at (0,3) (3 turns left).\n- Head toward an unknown remaining apple at row 9 (e.g., (2,9), (4,9), (5,9), or (7,9)) by moving UP and RIGHT as needed.\n- Avoid the enemy snake by steering clear of column 7.\n- Prioritize survival and apple collection to outscore the enemy.\n\nLEFT",
