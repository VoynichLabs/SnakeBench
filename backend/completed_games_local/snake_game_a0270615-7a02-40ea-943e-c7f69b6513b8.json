Main risk is future collision with enemy snake #0. Enemy is far right (x=9), so staying left side might be safer early on.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT moves me toward apple (1, 8), keeps away from enemy initially, and doesn\u2019t box me in.  \n\nLet\u2019s check: from (3, 8), next turn I could go LEFT again to (2, 8), then (1, 8) to eat apple. That\u2019s a clear short-term plan.  \n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan note for future self:**  \nMove toward (1, 8) apple while avoiding moving too close to enemy at (9, 7). After eating apple, consider going downward toward other apples, but watch for enemy movement patterns.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Actually, none of those apples are at (7, 8), (7, 6), (6, 7), or (8, 7). So enemy won\u2019t grow this turn.  \n\nSo enemy cannot move RIGHT into (8, 7) (its own body).  \nMy possible moves:  \n- (2, 9), (2, 7), (1, 8), (3, 8) \u2013 none are in enemy\u2019s possible moves (7, 8), (7, 6), (6, 7), so no head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple to (2, 8) is (1, 8) \u2013 1 step LEFT.  \nEating it would give me my first apple and grow to length 2.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Safety after eating apple:**  \nIf I move LEFT to (1, 8) and eat apple, my body will be [(1, 8), (2, 8)] next turn.  \nFrom (1, 8), possible moves: UP (1, 9), DOWN (1, 7), LEFT (0, 8), RIGHT (2, 8) \u2014 but RIGHT (2, 8) will be my body next turn, so that\u2019s invalid. So I\u2019d have 3 safe moves next turn if I eat apple now.  \n\nIf I avoid eating apple now, I could go RIGHT to (3, 8) to stay away from enemy and keep flexibility, but then apple (1, 8) is still there and enemy might go for it later.  \n\nBut eating early is good to grow and score. Also, enemy is far at (7, 7), so no immediate threat near (1, 8).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options:**  \nFrom (1, 8), I can go DOWN toward (2, 0) or (5, 1) apples later.  \nAlso, I should avoid moving toward enemy until necessary.  \n\nLEFT seems the best \u2014 gets apple, grows, still safe next turn.  \n\n**Short-term plan note for future self:**  \nAfter eating apple at (1, 8), move DOWN toward (2, 0) or (5, 1) apples while monitoring enemy movement. Avoid trapping myself in corners.  \n\nLEFT",

Enemy body at (7, 7).  \nEnemy\u2019s possible moves from (6, 7):  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 8)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 6)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 7)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 7) (its own body, so invalid unless it grows this turn)  \n\nCould enemy grow this turn?  \nApples reachable in 1 move from enemy: none of (9,2), (5,1), (2,0), (9,0), (0,7) are at (6,8), (6,6), (5,7), or (7,7). So enemy won\u2019t grow this turn, so RIGHT into (7,7) is blocked by its own body.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s possible head positions next turn: (6,8), (6,6), (5,7).  \n\nMy possible safe moves: (1,9), (1,7), (0,8).  \nCheck head-on collision:  \n- (1,9) vs enemy\u2019s possible (6,8) \u2192 no conflict.  \n- (1,7) vs enemy\u2019s possible (6,6) or (5,7) \u2192 no conflict.  \n- (0,8) vs enemy\u2019s possible (6,8) \u2192 no conflict.  \n\nSo all three moves are safe from immediate head-on collision.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apples to (1, 8):  \n- (0, 7) is at distance |1-0|+|8-7| = 2 steps (LEFT then DOWN).  \n- (2, 0) is far.  \n- (5, 1) is far.  \n- (9, 2) and (9, 0) are far.  \n\nNo apple is adjacent this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safe moves after each option:**  \nFrom (1, 9): possible moves next turn: UP (1, 10) out of bounds \u2192 invalid, DOWN (1, 8) my old head position? Wait, my body next turn will be [(new head), (1, 8), (2, 8)]? Let\u2019s check: currently body = [(1,8),(2,8)]? Actually current body is [(2,8)] only? No, I ate apple last turn, so my head moved to (1,8), my tail was at (2,8) and I grew by 1 after eating, so now body length is 2: head (1,8), then (2,8) as only body segment. So yes, body = [(1,8),(2,8)] is wrong \u2014 body is given as [(2,8)]? Wait, in game state: \u201cHead: (1, 8) Body: [(2, 8)]\u201d means head at (1,8), body segment at (2,8). So length = 2 total.  \n\nIf I move to (1,9), next turn body will be [(1,9),(1,8),(2,8)]? No \u2014 growth happens only when eating apple. I am not eating apple this turn, so my tail will move forward. Actually Snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves into previous segment\u2019s position, last segment (tail) vacates its old cell. So if I move to (1,9), body becomes [(1,9),(1,8)], tail at (1,8) vacates (2,8) is gone.  \n\nSo next turn from (1,9), my body will be at (1,8). So possible moves from (1,9): UP (1,10) invalid, DOWN (1,8) my body, LEFT (0,9) valid, RIGHT (2,9) valid. So 2 safe moves.  \n\nFrom (1,7): body becomes [(1,7),(1,8)], so from (1,7) next turn: UP (1,8) body, DOWN (1,6) valid, LEFT (0,7) valid, RIGHT (2,7) valid \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nFrom (0,8): body becomes [(0,8),(1,8)], so from (0,8) next turn: UP (0,9) valid, DOWN (0,7) valid, LEFT (-1,8) invalid, RIGHT (1,8) body \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\nSo (1,7) gives most options next turn (3 moves).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Path toward apples:**  \n(0,7) is apple. From (1,7), I can go LEFT to (0,7) next turn to eat it. From (1,9) or (0,8), reaching (0,7) takes more steps.  \n\nEnemy is at (6,7), apple at (0,7) is closer to me than to enemy. Moving toward it seems good.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid future traps:**  \nMoving DOWN to (1,7) is safe now and keeps options open.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,7), if apple at (0,7) still there, consider moving LEFT to eat it unless enemy threatens. Monitor enemy movement toward (5,1) or (2,0).  \n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN  \n\nDOWN",

Its possible moves:  \nUP (5, 8), DOWN (5, 6), LEFT (4, 7), RIGHT (6, 7) (its own body, invalid unless it eats apple).  \nApples reachable in 1 move for enemy: (5, 1) is too far, (0, 7) is far, others far. So enemy won\u2019t grow this turn \u2192 RIGHT into (6, 7) blocked.  \nSo enemy\u2019s possible head positions next turn: (5, 8), (5, 6), (4, 7).  \n\nMy safe moves: DOWN (1, 6), LEFT (0, 7), RIGHT (2, 7).  \n\nCheck head-on collisions:  \n- LEFT (0, 7) vs enemy\u2019s possible heads: none match \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (1, 6) vs enemy\u2019s possible heads: no match \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (2, 7) vs enemy\u2019s possible heads: no match \u2192 safe.  \n\nAll three are safe from immediate head-on collision.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple advantage:**  \nLEFT (0, 7) eats apple immediately \u2192 I grow to length 3 (head + 2 body segments), score increases to 2 apples. This is beneficial for win condition.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety after eating apple:**  \nIf I eat apple at (0, 7), my new head at (0, 7), body becomes [(0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8)]? Wait:  \nCurrent: head (1, 7), body [(1, 8)].  \nIf I move LEFT to (0, 7) and eat apple: head moves to (0, 7), body grows by 1 segment \u2192 new body = [(1, 7), (1, 8)] (old head becomes first body segment, old body stays). So total length = 3 cells: head (0, 7), body (1, 7), body (1, 8).  \n\nNext turn from (0, 7), possible moves:  \nUP (0, 8): empty.  \nDOWN (0, 6): empty.  \nLEFT (-1, 7): out of bounds \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT (1, 7): my body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo only UP and DOWN available next turn. That\u2019s a bit restrictive, but I\u2019ll be alive and have 2 safe moves.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Alternative moves without eating apple:**  \nDOWN (1, 6): no apple, body becomes [(1, 7), (1, 8)]? Actually if no apple eaten: head moves to (1, 6), body becomes [(1, 7)], tail (1, 8) disappears. So length stays 2. Then from (1, 6) next turn: UP (1, 7) body, DOWN (1, 5), LEFT (0, 6), RIGHT (2, 6) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nRIGHT (2, 7): no apple, body becomes [(1, 7)], length 2. From (2, 7): UP (2, 8), DOWN (2, 6), LEFT (1, 7) body, RIGHT (3, 7) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Compare:**  \nEating apple gives me +1 apple (score 2 vs enemy\u2019s 1), but reduces next turn moves to 2.  \nNot eating apple keeps moves at 3 next turn but no score gain.  \n\nSince the goal is to reach 50 apples, eating apples early is good if safe. Here, (0, 7) is safe this turn, and enemy is far (distance 5). I should take it.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan after eating:**  \nFrom (0, 7) after eating, next turn I\u2019ll have only UP (0, 8) or DOWN (0, 6).  \n- UP (0, 8): then possible moves: UP (0, 9), DOWN (0, 7) body, LEFT invalid, RIGHT (1, 8) empty \u2192 2 moves.  \n- DOWN (0, 6): then possible moves: UP (0, 7) body, DOWN (0, 5), LEFT invalid, RIGHT (1, 6) empty \u2192 2 moves.  \n\nI\u2019ll need to plan escape from the left edge after eating.

Its possible moves:  \nUP (5, 7) (its own body, invalid unless it eats an apple this turn), DOWN (5, 5), LEFT (4, 6), RIGHT (6, 6).  \nNo apple is adjacent to enemy head. So enemy won\u2019t grow this turn \u2192 UP into (5, 7) is blocked by its own body.  \nThus enemy\u2019s possible head positions next turn: (5, 5), (4, 6), (6, 6).  \n\nMy moves:  \nUP (0, 8) vs enemy\u2019s possible heads: no match \u2192 safe.  \nDOWN (0, 6) vs enemy\u2019s possible heads: no match \u2192 safe.  \n\nBoth are safe from head-on collision this turn.  \nAlso no risk of moving into enemy body: enemy body is at (5, 7), far away.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple advantage:**  \nNo apple is adjacent to my head this turn, so no immediate eating.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety and options:**  \nFrom UP (0, 8):  \nNext turn moves: UP (0, 9) empty, DOWN (0, 7) my body, LEFT invalid, RIGHT (1, 8) empty \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\nFrom DOWN (0, 6):  \nNext turn moves: UP (0, 7) my body, DOWN (0, 5) empty, LEFT invalid, RIGHT (1, 6) empty \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\nBoth give same number of next-turn options.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nI\u2019m currently on the left edge (x=0), which restricts movement. I should move away from the edge to regain mobility.  \nUP (0, 8) keeps me near the top-left corner; DOWN (0, 6) moves me slightly toward the center vertically but still stuck on left edge.  \n\nFrom (0, 8) next turn, I could go RIGHT to (1, 8) to escape the edge.  \nFrom (0, 6) next turn, I could go RIGHT to (1, 6) to escape the edge.  \n\nBut apples are at (9, 2), (5, 1), (2, 0), (9, 0), (6, 9).  \nClosest apple to (0, 8) is (2, 0) in terms of Manhattan distance but far.  \nClosest apple to (0, 6) is (2, 0) or (5, 1) \u2013 similar distances.  \n\nThe enemy is at (5, 6) \u2013 moving toward the top-right area where apple (6, 9) is.  \nIf I go UP to (0, 8), I\u2019m farther from enemy but also farther from most apples.  \nIf I go DOWN to (0, 6), I\u2019m closer to the lower apples (5, 1), (2, 0), (9, 0), (9, 2).  \n\nGiven my length is 3 and enemy\u2019s is 2, I have a slight advantage. I should aim to collect apples while avoiding head-on collisions.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nI choose DOWN to (0, 6) because it moves me slightly toward the cluster of apples in the bottom half, and next turn I can go RIGHT to (1, 6) to escape the left edge and open more options.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (0, 6), go RIGHT to (1, 6) if safe, to get off the left edge. Then assess apple targets (2, 0) or (5, 1). Keep enemy\u2019s position in mind; it may head toward (6, 9).  \n\nDOWN",

RIGHT requires to moving one right and 7 down.\n- Apple at (2,5): LEFT requires moving 2 left and 3 up. RIGHT requires moving 4 right and 3 up.\n- Apple at (9,2): LEFT requires moving 5 left and 6 down. RIGHT requires moving 3 right and 6 down.\n\nGiven this information, LEFT or RIGHT could be good choices.

Next moves from (5,1): UP (5,2), DOWN (5,0), RIGHT (6,1) \u2192 all 3 safe (no body/board edge). Good mobility.  \n- DOWN to (4,0): no apple, length stays 3. Next moves from (4,0): LEFT (3,0), RIGHT (5,0) \u2192 only 2 safe moves (UP is my body at (4,1)). Lower mobility, but closer to (2,0).  \n- UP to (4,2): no apple, length 3. Next moves from (4,2): UP (4,3), LEFT (3,2), RIGHT (5,2) \u2192 all 3 safe. Good mobility but farther from apples.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nEating (5,1) now gives me apple lead (3 vs enemy 2). Enemy is far away, so no immediate threat. After eating (5,1), I can consider (2,0) next or go toward (2,5). Need to avoid trapping myself later.  \n\nRIGHT is clearly best: immediate apple, safe, keeps good future options.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5,1), check enemy position. Likely safe moves: RIGHT to (6,1) or DOWN to (5,0) toward (2,0), or UP to (5,2). Avoid moving into possible enemy path if it gets close. Prioritize staying alive and collecting apples while keeping escape routes.  \n\nRIGHT",

My current position and safe moves**  \nMy head: (7, 1)  \nMy body: [(6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1)]  \nApples: (9, 2), (2, 0), (9, 0), (2, 5), (5, 8)  \nEnemy snake #0: head (9, 7), body [(9, 8), (8, 8)], length 3, apples: 2  \n\nPossible moves from (7, 1):  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 2): empty  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 0): empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 1): my body \u2192 invalid  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 1): empty  \n\nSo UP, DOWN, RIGHT are immediately safe (no walls, no bodies now).  \n\n**2. Simultaneous move collision risk**  \nEnemy snake #0 at (9, 7) can move:  \n- UP (9, 8): own body \u2192 invalid  \n- DOWN (9, 6): empty  \n- LEFT (8, 7): empty  \n- RIGHT: off board \u2192 invalid  \n\nSo enemy possible heads next turn: (9, 6), (8, 7).  \n\nMy possible heads next turn: (7, 2), (7, 0), (8, 1).  \nNo overlap \u2192 no risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**3. Apple targeting**  \nClosest apples to me (Manhattan distance from (7, 1)):  \n- (9, 2): |7-9| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3  \n- (9, 0): |7-9| + |1-0| = 2 + 1 = 3  \n- (2, 0): |7-2| + |1-0| = 5 + 1 = 6  \n- (2, 5): |7-2| + |1-5| = 5 + 4 = 9  \n- (5, 8): |7-5| + |1-8| = 2 + 7 = 9  \n\nSo (9, 2) and (9, 0) are tied for closest (distance 3).  \n\nFrom my possible moves:  \n- UP (7, 2): distance to (9, 2) = 2, to (9, 0) = 4  \n- DOWN (7, 0): distance to (9, 0) = 2, to (9, 2) = 4  \n- RIGHT (8, 1): distance to (9, 2) = 2, to (9, 0) = 2  \n\nRIGHT gets equally close to both apples (distance 2). UP favors (9, 2), DOWN favors (9, 0).  \n\n**4. Future safety after each move**  \nUP (7, 2):  \nNext moves from there: UP (7, 3), DOWN (7, 1), LEFT (6, 2), RIGHT (8, 2). All safe next turn assuming enemy doesn\u2019t block. Good mobility.  \n\nDOWN (7, 0):  \nNext moves: UP (7, 1), LEFT (6, 0), RIGHT (8, 0). All safe next turn. Good but near bottom edge.  \n\nRIGHT (8, 1):  \nNext moves: UP (8, 2), DOWN (8, 0), LEFT (7, 1), RIGHT (9, 1). All safe next turn. Moves closer to right wall but still has options.  \n\nAll three safe moves give good options next turn.  \n\n**5. Enemy positioning**  \nEnemy is far away (top-right area), so immediate threat low. But moving RIGHT gets me closer to the apples on the right side.  \n\n**6. Long-term planning**  \nI want to maintain mobility while targeting apples efficiently.  \nRIGHT (8, 1) is good because:  \n- It keeps central y-coordinate (y=1), allowing next move UP or DOWN toward either apple.  \n- It\u2019s equally close to both closest apples.  \n- From (8, 1), I can go to (9, 1) next turn and then UP to (9, 2) or DOWN to (9, 0).  \n\nBut UP (7, 2) also reasonable \u2014 slightly safer from wall proximity, but favors only (9, 2).  \n\nGiven enemy is far and I want to keep options open for both apples, RIGHT seems slightly better \u2014 it reduces distance to both apples equally and keeps flexibility for next turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 1), check enemy position. Likely go UP toward (9, 2) if safe, else DOWN toward (9, 0). Avoid moving into (9, 1) if enemy might enter it next turn.  \n\nRIGHT",

UP favors (9, 2), DOWN favors (9, 0).  \n\n**Future safety:**  \nUP (8, 2): next moves UP (8, 3), DOWN (8, 1), LEFT (7, 2), RIGHT (9, 2). All safe next turn except possibly if enemy moves into (9, 2)? Enemy at (9, 6) can\u2019t reach (9, 2) in 1 move.  \n\nDOWN (8, 0): next moves UP (8, 1), LEFT (7, 0), RIGHT (9, 0). All safe next turn.  \n\nRIGHT (9, 1): next moves UP (9, 2), DOWN (9, 0), LEFT (8, 1). RIGHT off board \u2192 invalid. So from (9, 1), only UP, DOWN, LEFT are possible next turn.

Enemy can\u2019t reach (8, 1) from (9, 6) in 1 move, but could in 2 moves.  \n\n**Enemy\u2019s possible moves:** Enemy likely wants apples too. Closest apple to enemy: (5, 8) distance 5, (9, 2) distance 5, (9, 0) distance 6. So enemy might move DOWN (9, 5) or LEFT (8, 6) to get closer to center.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT (9, 1) puts me on x=9, which reduces future lateral mobility but gives me equal access to both (9, 2) and (9, 0) next turn. However, moving RIGHT means next turn I\u2019ll be against the right wall, so only 3 moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n\nUP (8, 2) keeps more open space (4 moves next turn) and gets me closer to (9, 2) specifically. DOWN (8, 0) also keeps 3 moves next turn but near bottom edge.  \n\nGiven enemy is far and I want to maximize future mobility while targeting apples, UP seems slightly better \u2014 it doesn\u2019t corner me against the wall yet, and I can still go RIGHT next turn to (9, 2) for apple.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 2), check if (9, 2) is safe (enemy not moving there), then possibly go RIGHT to eat apple if safe, else continue UP/LEFT to stay safe. Avoid moving into (9, 2) if enemy could head-collide there.  \n\nUP",

Wait: my body will be [(9, 2) if I go RIGHT and eat apple, but I\u2019m considering UP now, not RIGHT.] Actually: If I go UP now without eating apple, my body next turn: head (8, 3), then (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1). So (8, 2) will be my body next turn. So from (8, 3), DOWN would be into my body \u274c. So safe moves from (8, 3) next turn: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n3. **LEFT to (7, 2)**  \n   Next turn head at (7, 2). Possible moves: all 4 directions likely safe except maybe (8, 2) will be my body? Let\u2019s see: If I go LEFT now, my body next turn: head (7, 2), then (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1). So (8, 2) is my body next turn, so from (7, 2), RIGHT would be into my body \u274c. So safe: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\nSo all safe moves give 3 options next turn except maybe UP gives UP/LEFT/RIGHT, LEFT gives UP/DOWN/LEFT, RIGHT gives UP/DOWN/LEFT.  \n\nEating apple now is good for score and growth. But eating puts me at (9, 2), against right edge, reducing future right moves but not trapping me yet.  \n\n**Enemy behavior:**  \nEnemy might go for apple (5, 8) or (9, 2)? They\u2019re at (9, 5), so (9, 2) is 3 steps away, (5, 8) is 5 steps away. They could move DOWN (9, 4) or LEFT (8, 5) to get closer to center apples. They\u2019re unlikely to reach (9, 2) next turn, so RIGHT for me is safe from head-on collision.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT gets the apple, increases score to 4 apples vs enemy\u2019s 2, lengthens my body, and is safe this turn. The only downside is slightly reduced mobility next turn (still 3 moves). That\u2019s acceptable.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9, 2), avoid moving RIGHT (off board). Choose among UP, DOWN, LEFT based on apple positions and enemy location. Possibly target (9, 0) or (5, 8) next.  \n\nRIGHT",

Enemy cannot reach (9, 1) in one move. So DOWN has no head-on risk.\n\n**Future safety:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (9, 1):  \nMy body next turn: head (9, 1), then (9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1) \u2014 length 6.  \nFrom (9, 1), possible moves:  \n- UP (9, 2): my body \u274c (will be my neck next turn)  \n- DOWN (9, 0): apple \u2705  \n- LEFT (8, 1): my body \u274c  \n- RIGHT: off board \u274c  \n\nSo only DOWN to (9, 0) is safe next turn. That\u2019s risky because only one move next turn.\n\nIf I go UP to (9, 3):  \nMy body next turn: head (9, 3), then (9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1).  \nFrom (9, 3), possible moves:  \n- UP (9, 4): enemy\u2019s current head location, but enemy will move away potentially \u2705 empty next turn  \n- DOWN (9, 2): my body \u274c  \n- LEFT (8, 3): empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT: off board \u274c  \n\nSo safe moves from (9, 3) next turn: UP, LEFT (2 options). Better than DOWN\u2019s 1 option, but head-on risk this turn.\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple to (9, 2):  \n- (9, 0): distance 2 (down twice)  \n- (3, 2): distance 6  \n- (2, 0): distance 9  \n- (2, 5): distance 8  \n- (5, 8): distance 9  \n\n(9, 0) is closest. DOWN moves toward it.\n\n**Enemy\u2019s plan:** Enemy at (9, 4) might go DOWN to (9, 3) to chase apple (3, 2) or (5, 8)? Possibly. If enemy goes DOWN, I go UP \u2192 head-on collision at (9, 3). That\u2019s bad for both. So UP is risky.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nUP \u2192 possible head-on collision if enemy moves DOWN.  \nDOWN \u2192 safe from head-on, but only 1 safe move next turn (to apple (9, 0)), which could be okay if I plan to eat it and reassess after.\n\nEating (9, 0) next turn would grow me to length 7, and from (9, 0) I\u2019d have possible moves UP (9, 1) \u2014 which might be body then? Let\u2019s check: after eating (9, 0), body: head (9, 0), then (9, 1), (9, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (7, 1), (6, 1). From (9, 0), UP (9, 1) is body \u274c, LEFT (8, 0) empty \u2705, DOWN off board \u274c, RIGHT off board \u274c. So only LEFT. That\u2019s a dead end after eating.\n\nSo DOWN now \u2192 next turn only DOWN to (9, 0) safe \u2192 then only LEFT to (8, 0) safe \u2192 then from (8, 0) maybe more options.\n\nUP now \u2192 possible death this turn if enemy moves DOWN. Enemy might not move DOWN? They could go LEFT to (8, 4) to avoid wall, but we can\u2019t assume.\n\nGiven the head-on risk, DOWN seems safer short-term, even though it limits next turn\u2019s options.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next self:**  \nIf I go DOWN now to (9, 1), next turn I must go DOWN to (9, 0) to eat apple and survive. Then from (9, 0), only LEFT to (8, 0) is safe. Try to then move toward center/apples while avoiding trapping self.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Next turn, consider moving toward (3, 2) via LEFT or UP, but check enemy\u2019s position first. If enemy moves toward (5, 8), I can safely target (3, 2) and (1, 4). Keep length advantage \u2014 avoid head-on collisions by staying 1+ cells away from enemy\u2019s possible moves.\n\nUP",

No overlap with enemy\u2019s possible moves \u2192 safe from head-on collision.\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple is (2, 0) (2 steps left, 2 down).  \n- LEFT to (2, 2) gets closer to (2, 0) and (1, 4) and (2, 5).  \n- DOWN to (3, 1) also gets closer to (2, 0).  \n- UP to (3, 3) moves away from (2, 0) but toward (2, 5) and (1, 4).  \n\nLEFT and DOWN are both good for nearest apple.\n\n**Future mobility after each move:**  \n- LEFT to (2, 2): body becomes [(3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0)] (tail stays at (7,0) for now). From (2,2): UP (2,3), DOWN (2,1), LEFT (1,2), RIGHT (3,2) \u2014 RIGHT is my body (segment 2), so 3 safe moves.  \n- DOWN to (3, 1): body same as above. From (3,1): UP (3,2) blocked, DOWN (3,0), LEFT (2,1), RIGHT (4,1) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n- UP to (3, 3): from (3,3): UP (3,4), DOWN (3,2) blocked, LEFT (2,3), RIGHT (4,3) \u2192 3 safe moves.\n\nAll give 3 safe next moves.\n\n**Enemy prediction:**  \nEnemy likely goes to apple (2, 5) or (1, 4) or (0, 8) or (9, 4). Currently at (5, 8), apple (2, 5) is 3 left and 3 down, apple (1, 4) is 4 left and 4 down. Enemy may move LEFT toward them. That\u2019s far from me.\n\n**Long-term plan after this move:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (2, 2), next turn I can go DOWN to (2, 1) then (2, 0) to eat apple (2, 0). That\u2019s a safe path (check next turn for obstacles). Then aim for (1, 4) or (2, 5). Keep an eye on enemy moving toward same apples eventually, but I\u2019m closer.\n\nLEFT seems best because it gets me closer to (2, 0) and positions me well for (1, 4) and (2, 5) while keeping options open.\n\nLEFT",

That\u2019s far from my area currently.  \n\n---\n\n**7. Long-term plan:**  \nI want to collect apples efficiently while avoiding dead ends.  \n(2, 0) is close but moving DOWN means next turn I must go DOWN to eat it, then I\u2019m at bottom edge with fewer options.  \n(1, 4) is also close and moving UP or LEFT now sets me up for it.  \n\nGiven enemy is far, I prefer to go for (1, 4) because it\u2019s safer than bottom edge.  \nUP to (2, 3) gets me closer to (1, 4) and (2, 5) and keeps central mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**8. Final choice:**  \nUP seems best for apple proximity and future options.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 3), consider moving toward (1, 4) via LEFT then UP, or directly UP toward (2, 5) if safe. Keep enemy in mind \u2014 they may head for (2, 5) too, but I\u2019m closer.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

Check for collisions with enemy movement:**\nEnemy head at (2,8) could move:\n- UP \u2192 (2,9) \u2014 safe for me\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,7) \u2014 safe for me\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,8) \u2014 safe for me\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,8) \u2014 its own body, not allowed\n\nSo enemy cannot reach (2,5), (1,4), or (3,4) in one turn.  \nThus all UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe from enemy head collision this turn.\n\n**4. Future safety after each move:**\n- **UP to (2,5)**:  \n  Next turn from (2,5): possible moves: UP (2,6), LEFT (1,5), RIGHT (3,5). All likely safe next turn (no immediate body, enemy far). Eating apple \u2192 grow by 1, tail stays at (6,2) for now.\n- **LEFT to (1,4)**:  \n  Next turn from (1,4): possible moves: UP (1,5), DOWN (1,3), LEFT (0,4). All likely safe. Eating apple \u2192 grow.\n- **RIGHT to (3,4)**:  \n  Next turn from (3,4): possible moves: UP (3,5), DOWN (3,3), RIGHT (4,4). All safe. No apple eaten, so no growth.\n\nEating apples is good for score and also extends tail, giving slightly more space behind.\n\n**5. Long-term positioning:**\nFrom (2,5) after eating apple (2,5), I can go to (1,5) \u2192 toward apple (0,8) eventually or (1,4) is already gone if I eat it now.  \nFrom (1,4) after eating apple (1,4), I can go to (1,5) or (0,4) \u2192 toward apple (0,8) or back to center.\n\nBoth apple moves are good, but UP to (2,5) keeps me closer to center board, which might be safer for future mobility.\n\nLEFT to (1,4) pushes me to left edge\u2014could limit options if enemy approaches later.\n\n**6. Final choice:**\nUP gets an apple, keeps central position, and has good follow-up moves.  \nLEFT also gets an apple but moves toward edge.  \nRIGHT gets no apple.\n\nBest: **UP**\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (2,5), eat apple, then consider moving toward (0,8) via LEFT/UP path, but check enemy location first.

No.\n   - Occupied by enemy body? No (enemy body cells: (1,8),(2,8),(3,8),(4,8)).\n   - Safe? Yes.\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (2, 5)\n   - Within board: yes (y=5).\n   - Occupied by my body? Yes, (2,5) is my second segment \u2192 immediate death.\n   - Not safe.\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (1, 6)\n   - Within board: yes (x=1).\n   - Occupied by my body? No.\n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.\n   - Safe? Yes.\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (3, 6)\n   - Within board: yes (x=3).\n   - Occupied by my body? No.\n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.\n   - Safe? Yes.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Consider enemy possible moves:**\nEnemy at (0,8) with body (1,8),(2,8),(3,8),(4,8).\nEnemy\u2019s safe moves:\n- UP \u2192 (0,9): empty, safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,7): empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 death.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,8): occupied by its own body \u2192 death.\nSo enemy can go UP or DOWN.\n\nIf enemy goes UP to (0,9), it\u2019s far from me.\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (0,7), still far.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk for any of my safe moves.\n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**\n- (1,4): 2 units away (Manhattan distance) from LEFT path.\n- (4,9): far.\n- (2,0): far.\n- (9,4): far.\n- (8,7): far.\n\nClosest apple is (1,4) at distance 2 from (1,6) if I go LEFT now.\n\n---\n\n**Future options after each move:**\n\n**UP** to (2,7):\n- Next moves from (2,7): UP (2,8) \u2192 but (2,8) is enemy body \u2192 would be dangerous next turn if enemy stays? Actually enemy at (0,8) could move away from (2,8) but it\u2019s risky.\n- LEFT from (2,7) \u2192 (1,7) safe.\n- RIGHT from (2,7) \u2192 (3,7) safe.\n- DOWN from (2,7) \u2192 back to (2,6) safe unless occupied next turn (won't be).\nSo UP keeps central position.\n\n**LEFT** to (1,6):\n- Next moves from (1,6): UP (1,7), DOWN (1,5), LEFT (0,6), RIGHT (2,6).\n- DOWN (1,5) leads toward apple (1,4).\n- This puts me closer to apple (1,4) and keeps options open except maybe left into (0,6) could be a bit near board edge but still fine.\n\n**RIGHT** to (3,6):\n- Next moves: UP (3,7), DOWN (3,5), RIGHT (4,6), LEFT back to (2,6).\n- Moves me toward center/right side apples (4,9),(8,7) later.\n\n---\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\nI have 7 apples vs enemy 4. I\u2019m leading, so staying safe is priority.  \nGoing LEFT toward (1,4) seems direct, but I must consider if enemy could intercept? Enemy at (0,8) is far from (1,4), so not a threat soon.\n\nHowever, moving LEFT to (1,6) might reduce future space slightly because my long body is along x=2,3,4,5 at y=2, so I have room above.\n\nActually, looking at my body: it\u2019s mostly on bottom half (y=2 to y=6). Going UP opens more space above. Going LEFT keeps me near left wall which could limit escape later.\n\nGiven my body occupies y=2 to y=6 on x=2, moving UP to (2,7) avoids trapping myself near left edge.\n\nAlso, apple (1,4) is still reachable later: from (2,7), I could go LEFT to (1,7) then DOWN toward it.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**\nUP seems safest \u2014 moves into open space, keeps more options next turn, avoids risk of boxing myself near left wall.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (2,7), consider moving LEFT to (1,7) then down toward apple (1,4), or go RIGHT toward center board. Keep an eye on enemy movement near (0,8) \u2014 they may go for apple at (4,9) via (0,9) across top, so be ready to avoid head collisions in the top row later.\n\nUP",

This is not safe as there is T (body) there.\n- DOWN: Moving DOWN would move the head to (0, 5). This is a safe move.\n- LEFT: Moving LEFT would move the head to (-1, 6). This is not safe as we will go outside the board.\n- RIGHT: Moving RIGHT would move the head to (1, 6). This is a safe move.\n\n2) Analyze the remaining safe moves:\n- DOWN (0, 5): Open area.\n- RIGHT (1, 6): Open area.\n\n3) Evaluate and pick move:\n\nThe apples at (2, 0), (1, 4), (9, 4), (4, 9), (8, 7) are on the board. Snake #1 head is currently at (3,7).\nPrioritize apple collection. Need to avoid collision with enemy snake. The closest apples are at (1,4) and (2,0).\n\nIf I go down I end up at (0,5). From there, I can go right towards (1,4). Alternatively, from here I can still aim at the (2,0) apple by going right and then down.\nIf I go right I end up at (1,6). From there, I can go down towards (1,4).\n\nLet's consider Snake #1. Snake #1 is at (3,7). So it could go up, down, left, or right. Going left would mean it is at (2,7) next turn, and currently there is T (body) at (2,7) so Snake #1 will probably not go left. Going down would put snake #1 at (3,6). We don't really care about that. Going right would put snake #1 at (4,7). Going up would put snake #1 at (3,8). Based on the board, snake #1 will likely go down or up.\n\nI think going right is a better move than going down, since it opens up more possibilities in the future.\n\nLong-term plan: Move right then down. Avoid the snake #1 and collect apples at (1,4) and (2,0). Be aware of the borders.\n\nRIGHT",

Length 5 (4 apples eaten means starting length 1 + 4 = 5).  \n\n---\n\n**Possible moves from (3, 7):**  \n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (3, 8)  \n   - On board? Yes (y=8).  \n   - Occupied? Board shows (3, 8) is empty (board row 8 col 3 is \u2018.\u2019). Wait, check: row 8 in board diagram:  \n     Row 8: T T T . . . . . . .  \n     So x=0,1,2 are T (enemy body), x=3 is \u2018.\u2019 empty. Yes.  \n   - Safe from my body? My body coords: (2,7),(2,6),(2,5),(2,4),(2,3),(2,2),(3,2). None is (3,8).  \n   - Enemy body? Enemy body: (0,7),(0,8),(1,8),(2,8). None is (3,8).  \n   - Enemy head possible move? Enemy head at (0,6). Possible moves for enemy: UP (0,7) into own body \u2014 no, DOWN (0,5), LEFT off board, RIGHT (1,6). So enemy won\u2019t be at (3,8) next turn.  \n   - So UP is safe.\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 6)  \n   - On board? Yes (y=6).  \n   - Occupied? Board row 6: 0 . T . . . . . . .  \n     x=3 is \u2018T\u2019? Wait row 6 col 3: That\u2019s x=3, y=6. Board row 6: \"0 . T . . . . . . .\"  \n     So x=0: \u20180\u2019 (enemy head label?), no that\u2019s enemy head at (0,6) but board shows \u20180\u2019 at (0,6). x=1: \u2018.\u2019, x=2: \u2018T\u2019 (my body), x=3: \u2018.\u2019? Let\u2019s read carefully:  \n     Actually row 6: \"0 . T . . . . . . .\" means: col0='0', col1='.', col2='T', col3='.', col4='.', etc.  \n     So (3,6) is empty.  \n   - My body? My body has (2,6) but not (3,6).  \n   - Enemy body? Enemy body doesn\u2019t include (3,6).  \n   - Enemy head possible move? Enemy at (0,6) can\u2019t reach (3,6) in 1 move.  \n   - So DOWN is safe.\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 7)  \n   - On board? Yes (x=2).  \n   - Occupied? My own body segment #2 is (2, 7) (directly behind head). That\u2019s suicide (moving into own body).  \n   - Eliminate.\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 7)  \n   - On board? Yes (x=4).  \n   - Occupied? Board row 7: \"T . T 1 . . . . A .\"  \n     So x=4 is \u2018.\u2019 empty.  \n   - My body? No.  \n   - Enemy body? No.  \n   - Enemy head possible move? Enemy can\u2019t reach (4,7) in 1 move from (0,6).  \n   - So RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Apples positions:**  \n(2,0), (1,4), (9,4), (4,9), (8,7)  \n\nFrom my head (3,7):  \n- Apple at (8,7): same y, distance 5 right.  \n- Apple at (4,9): 1 right, 2 up.  \n- Apple at (1,4): 2 left, 3 down.  \n- Apple at (9,4): 6 right, 3 down.  \n- Apple at (2,0): 1 left, 7 down.  \n\nClosest apples in Manhattan distance:  \n(4,9): dist 3  \n(8,7): dist 5  \n(1,4): dist 5  \n(9,4): dist 9  \n(2,0): dist 8  \n\nSo (4,9) is closest.\n\n---\n\n**Which safe move gets me closer to (4,9)?**  \nFrom (3,7) to (4,9): need +1 in x, +2 in y.  \n- UP (3,8): now dist to apple = |3-4|+|8-9|=1+1=2 (better, was 3)  \n- DOWN (3,6): dist=1+3=4 (worse)  \n- RIGHT (4,7): dist=0+2=2 (same improvement as UP)  \n\nBoth UP and RIGHT reduce distance to 2.\n\n---\n\n**Future options after each:**  \n\nUP to (3,8):  \nPossible next moves from (3,8): UP (3,9) \u2013 empty? Row 9: . . . . A . . . . . so x=3,y=9 empty. DOWN back to (3,7) \u2013 empty then (but was head pos, now empty). LEFT (2,8) \u2013 occupied by enemy body (enemy #0 body at (2,8)). RIGHT (4,8) \u2013 empty.  \nSo from (3,8), safe moves next turn likely UP, RIGHT, DOWN (LEFT deadly). That\u2019s 3 options.\n\nRIGHT to (4,7):  \nFrom (4,7): UP (4,8) empty, DOWN (4,6) empty, LEFT (3,7) empty now, RIGHT (5,7) empty. All 4 directions possibly safe unless enemy moves into them. Enemy head at (0,6) could move to (1,6) but not relevant. So 4 options.\n\nRIGHT gives more future mobility.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy head collision risk:**  \nEnemy head at (0,6) possible moves:  \nUP (0,7) \u2013 own body, no.  \nDOWN (0,5) \u2013 empty.  \nLEFT off board, no.  \nRIGHT (1,6) \u2013 empty.  \nSo enemy will likely go DOWN or RIGHT. Neither threatens (4,7) or (3,8) directly.\n\nNo head-on risk seen.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nWe want to target closest apple at (4,9). After RIGHT to (4,7), next turn UP to (4,8) then UP to (4,9) eats apple. That path seems safe. Also, staying away from my long body along column 2 is good. Avoid left side where my body blocks.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nRIGHT gets me closer to apple (4,9) while keeping more options next move.  \n\nRIGHT",

Wait (3,7) is my body currently (segment 2), but after moving LEFT without eating apple, tail moves: tail (2,3) disappears, body shifts: new body: head (3,8), then (4,8), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4). So (3,7) still occupied next turn? Let\u2019s check: current body: head (4,8), then (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (2,3). Moving LEFT without apple: new head (3,8), tail (2,3) removed, so new body: [(3,8),(4,8),(4,7),(3,7),(2,7),(2,6),(2,5),(2,4)]. So (3,7) is still occupied. So DOWN from (3,8) goes to (3,7) \u2192 body \u2192 illegal. LEFT from (3,8) to (2,8) empty. RIGHT to (4,8) body. UP to (3,9) empty. So next turn safe: LEFT, UP only. That\u2019s also limited.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,8):  \nNext turn body after no apple: [(5,8),(4,8),(4,7),(3,7),(2,7),(2,6),(2,5),(2,4)]. From (5,8): UP (5,9) empty, DOWN (5,7) empty, LEFT (4,8) body, RIGHT (6,8) empty. So safe: UP, DOWN, RIGHT \u2192 3 options, better mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter RIGHT, I\u2019ll have good mobility and can plan to go toward apple at (8,7) or (9,4) later while avoiding boxing myself in. Avoid moving toward enemy unless necessary; enemy is shorter and might risk hitting my body.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gets apple now but reduces next-move options to 2 (LEFT/RIGHT only) from top edge.  \nRIGHT gives best mobility for future turns and keeps me central.  \nLEFT gives worse mobility than RIGHT.  \n\nSince I\u2019m already ahead in apples (7 vs enemy 4), I don\u2019t need to greedily grab apple if it risks trapping myself. Better to stay safe with more options.  \n\nSo choose **RIGHT**.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Moving LEFT would go backwards into own body \u2192 death.  \n- Not safe.  \n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (7, 8)  \n- Inside board? Yes.  \n- My body? No.  \n- Enemy body? No.  \n- Safe? Yes.  \n\nSo safe moves: **UP, DOWN, RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Consider enemy snake\u2019s possible moves and head-on collisions\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (1, 3). Its safe moves:  \n- UP to (1,4) \u2192 hits its own body \u2192 no.  \n- DOWN to (1,2) \u2192 safe (empty).  \n- LEFT to (0,3) \u2192 safe (empty).  \n- RIGHT to (2,3) \u2192 safe (empty).  \n\nSo enemy can move DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nMy possible next head positions vs enemy possible next head positions:  \n- If I go UP to (6,9), enemy possible heads: (1,2), (0,3), (2,3) \u2014 no overlap \u2192 safe.  \n- If I go DOWN to (6,7), enemy possible heads same \u2014 no overlap \u2192 safe.  \n- If I go RIGHT to (7,8), enemy possible heads same \u2014 no overlap \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Future mobility and apple proximity\n\nFrom each safe move:\n\n**UP to (6,9)**  \nNext turn from (6,9): UP off board \u2192 no; DOWN to (6,8) safe unless occupied next turn? Possibly safe; LEFT to (5,9) safe? Check apple at (4,9) nearby but not immediate; RIGHT to (7,9) safe. So next turn safe moves likely 3 (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). But top row limits future upward growth.  \n\n**DOWN to (6,7)**  \nNext turn from (6,7): UP back to (6,8) safe; DOWN to (6,6) safe; LEFT to (5,7) safe? (my body at (4,7) not adjacent); RIGHT to (7,7) safe. So 4 safe moves next turn. Apple at (8,7) is closer? From (6,7) distance to (8,7) is 2 in x, 0 in y \u2192 Manhattan dist = 2.  \n\n**RIGHT to (7,8)**  \nNext turn from (7,8): UP to (7,9) safe; DOWN to (7,7) safe; LEFT back to (6,8) safe; RIGHT to (8,8) safe. So 4 safe moves next turn. Apple at (8,7) is 1 in x, 1 in y \u2192 dist = 2. Apple at (9,4) farther.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Compare apple targeting\n\nClosest apples:  \n- (4,9): from (6,8) dist 4; from (6,9) dist 3; from (6,7) dist 5; from (7,8) dist 5.  \n- (8,7): from (6,8) dist 3; from (6,9) dist 4; from (6,7) dist 2; from (7,8) dist 2.  \n- (9,4): far.  \n- (2,0): far.  \n- (8,0): far.  \n\n(6,7) and (7,8) both equally close to (8,7). (6,7) also closer to (4,9)? No, (4,9) is farther from (6,7) than from (6,8).  \n\nBut (6,7) puts me closer to bottom apples long-term? Not urgent.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Avoid trapping / maximize options\n\nUP to (6,9) \u2192 top edge reduces future UP option.  \nDOWN to (6,7) \u2192 central, more space.  \nRIGHT to (7,8) \u2192 right side, near apples (8,7) and (9,4), also central column access.  \n\nEnemy is at bottom-left, far from me. I\u2019m ahead in apples (7 vs 5), so I can play safe and keep mobility.  \n\nI think **RIGHT** keeps me closer to two apples ((8,7) and (9,4)) and maintains good mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7,8), consider moving toward (8,7) via DOWN or RIGHT next turn, depending on enemy positions. Keep escape routes open, avoid being forced into corners. Monitor enemy movement\u2014it might go for (2,0) apple.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Yes.\n\n**Safe moves:** UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Consider enemy possible moves and head-on collisions\n\nEnemy head at (2, 3). Possible moves for enemy:  \n- UP to (2,4) \u2192 empty, safe.  \n- DOWN to (2,2) \u2192 empty, safe.  \n- LEFT to (1,3) \u2192 its own body segment \u2192 no.  \n- RIGHT to (3,3) \u2192 empty, safe.\n\nSo enemy can move UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nMy possible next positions vs enemy possible next positions:  \n- If I go UP to (7,9): enemy possible heads: (2,4), (2,2), (3,3) \u2192 no overlap \u2192 safe.  \n- If I go DOWN to (7,7): enemy possible heads same \u2192 no overlap \u2192 safe.  \n- If I go RIGHT to (8,8): enemy possible heads same \u2192 no overlap \u2192 safe.\n\nNo head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Future mobility & apple proximity\n\nFrom each safe move:\n\n**UP to (7,9)**  \nNext turn from (7,9): UP off board \u2192 no; DOWN to (7,8) safe unless occupied next turn? My tail will move if I don't eat apple; currently tail at (2,6), will move to (2,5) if no apple eaten. So (7,8) will be empty next turn. LEFT to (6,9) safe? Yes. RIGHT to (8,9) safe? Yes. So 3 safe moves next turn (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Top row reduces upward mobility. Apple (4,9) is Manhattan distance 5 from (7,9). Apple (8,7) distance 3.\n\n**DOWN to (7,7)**  \nNext turn from (7,7): UP to (7,8) safe; DOWN to (7,6) safe; LEFT to (6,7) safe; RIGHT to (8,7) safe unless apple there? Apple at (8,7) means if I go RIGHT next turn from (7,7), I eat it. But this turn I'm at (7,8) going DOWN to (7,7) \u2192 next turn RIGHT to (8,7) eats apple. Good. 4 safe moves next turn. Apple (8,7) distance 1 next turn. Apple (9,4) distance 5.\n\n**RIGHT to (8,8)**  \nNext turn from (8,8): UP to (8,9) safe; DOWN to (8,7) safe (apple there); LEFT to (7,8) safe; RIGHT to (9,8) safe. 4 safe moves next turn. Apple (8,7) distance 1 next turn (DOWN from (8,8)). Apple (9,4) distance 4.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Compare apples\n\nClosest apples:  \n- (8,7): from (7,8) distance 1 in x, 1 in y \u2192 Manhattan dist = 2.  \n  - If I go DOWN to (7,7): dist to (8,7) = 1.  \n  - If I go RIGHT to (8,8): dist to (8,7) = 1.  \n  - If I go UP to (7,9): dist to (8,7) = 3.  \n- (4,9): from (7,8) dist = 4; from (7,9) dist = 3; from (7,7) dist = 5; from (8,8) dist = 5.  \n- (9,4): far.  \n- (2,0): far.  \n- (8,0): far.\n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT both put me equally close (distance 1 next turn) to apple (8,7). UP puts me slightly closer to (4,9) but farther from (8,7).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Avoid trapping\n\nUP \u2192 top edge reduces options.  \nDOWN \u2192 central, more space, close to apple.  \nRIGHT \u2192 also central, close to apple, good options.\n\nEnemy is far away at (2,3), moving possibly toward (2,0) apple. I'm ahead 7 vs 5 apples. I can play safe and go for nearest apple while keeping mobility.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are good. DOWN to (7,7) gives me next turn options: RIGHT to eat (8,7) apple, or DOWN/LEFT/UP to maneuver. RIGHT to (8,8) also gives DOWN to eat (8,7) apple next turn.  \nBut DOWN to (7,7) also opens path toward bottom apples later and keeps me more central. RIGHT puts me nearer right edge.\n\nI'll choose **DOWN** because it gives same apple access next turn while staying more flexible for future moves toward other apples.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7,7), likely RIGHT to (8,7) to eat apple unless enemy interferes. Monitor enemy movement toward (2,0). Keep escape routes open.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Yes.\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (6, 7)  \n- Inside board? Yes.  \n- My body? No.  \n- Enemy body? No.  \n- Safe? Yes.\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (8, 7)  \n- Inside board? Yes.  \n- My body? No.  \n- Enemy body? No.  \n- Apple? Yes \u2014 there is an apple at (8, 7). Eating it is safe.  \n- Safe? Yes.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Consider enemy possible moves and head-on collisions\n\nEnemy head at (2, 2). Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP to (2, 3) \u2192 its own body segment \u2192 no.  \n- DOWN to (2, 1) \u2192 empty, safe.  \n- LEFT to (1, 2) \u2192 empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT to (3, 2) \u2192 empty, safe.\n\nSo enemy can move DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nMy possible next positions vs enemy possible next positions:  \n- DOWN to (7, 6): enemy heads (2, 1), (1, 2), (3, 2) \u2192 no overlap \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT to (6, 7): enemy same \u2192 no overlap \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT to (8, 7): enemy same \u2192 no overlap \u2192 safe.\n\nNo head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Future mobility & apple proximity\n\nFrom each safe move:\n\n**DOWN to (7, 6)**  \nNext turn from (7, 6): UP to (7, 7) safe; DOWN to (7, 5) safe; LEFT to (6, 6) safe; RIGHT to (8, 6) safe. All 4 moves open. Apple distances: (8, 7) dist 2, (4, 9) dist 6, (9, 4) dist 4.\n\n**LEFT to (6, 7)**  \nNext turn from (6, 7): UP to (6, 8) safe? My body currently at (6, 8), but tail at (2, 7) will move to (2, 6) if no apple eaten, so (6, 8) will be free next turn. DOWN to (6, 6) safe; LEFT to (5, 7) safe; RIGHT to (7, 7) safe. All 4 moves likely safe. Apple (8, 7) dist 2, (4, 9) dist 4.\n\n**RIGHT to (8, 7)**  \nEating apple \u2192 grow by 1, tail stays at (2, 7). Next turn from (8, 7): UP to (8, 8) safe; DOWN to (8, 6) safe; LEFT to (7, 7) safe; RIGHT to (9, 7) safe. All 4 moves safe. Apple (9, 4) dist 3, (4, 9) dist 5.\n\nEating apple now gives me length 8 vs enemy length 6, increasing lead. Also apple disappears, denying enemy.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Avoid trapping\n\nAll three moves keep good mobility. RIGHT eats apple and stays central. LEFT moves toward board center but away from immediate apple. DOWN moves away from most apples.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Decision\n\nRIGHT gets apple immediately, increases score lead, keeps 4 safe moves next turn. Enemy is far away at (2, 2), not threatening (8, 7) area this turn. No risk of head-on collision. Best to grab apple while safe.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 7), consider moving toward (9, 4) or (4, 9) next, but also watch enemy movement toward (2, 0). Keep central mobility.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP to (2, 2) \u2192 its own body \u2192 no.  \n- DOWN to (2, 0) \u2192 empty (apple there).  \n- LEFT to (1, 1) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT to (3, 1) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.

Apple proximity & growth  \n\nApples: (2, 0), (9, 4), (4, 9), (8, 0), (4, 2).  \n\n- UP (8, 8): closest apple (4, 9) dist 5, (9, 4) dist 4.  \n- DOWN (8, 6): closest apple (9, 4) dist 3, (8, 0) dist 6.  \n- RIGHT (9, 7): closest apple (9, 4) dist 3, (4, 9) dist 6.  \n\nNo apple directly at my possible next heads. All equal in immediate apple reach.  \n\nBut DOWN or RIGHT keeps me closer to (9, 4). UP moves away from most apples.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility  \n\nFrom each safe next head:  \n\n**UP (8, 8)**  \nNext turn from (8, 8): UP (8, 9) safe, DOWN (8, 7) safe? That\u2019s current head \u2014 will be free next turn since I moved. LEFT (7, 8) safe? My body currently at (7, 8), but tail (2, 7) moves to (2, 6) if no apple eaten \u2192 (7, 8) will be free. RIGHT (9, 8) safe. All 4 moves open.  \n\n**DOWN (8, 6)**  \nNext turn from (8, 6): UP (8, 7) safe, DOWN (8, 5) safe, LEFT (7, 6) safe, RIGHT (9, 6) safe. All 4 moves open.  \n\n**RIGHT (9, 7)**  \nNext turn from (9, 7): UP (9, 8) safe, DOWN (9, 6) safe, LEFT (8, 7) safe, RIGHT (10, 7) off-board \u2192 so only 3 safe moves next turn (RIGHT is deadly). That\u2019s worse mobility.  \n\nSo RIGHT reduces future options because I\u2019d be on right edge.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Enemy threat  \n\nEnemy is far away (2, 1), heading possibly toward (2, 0) apple. No immediate threat to my area.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Decision  \n\nUP and DOWN both keep 4 moves next turn, RIGHT only 3. DOWN is closer to (9, 4) apple than UP.  \nDOWN also keeps central position, avoids edges.  \n\nBetter to choose DOWN for mobility and apple proximity.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 6), consider moving toward (9, 4) via RIGHT or DOWN, but check enemy movement first. Keep away from right edge to preserve mobility.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

No.  \n- Safe? Yes.\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (9, 6)  \n- Inside board? Yes.  \n- My body? No.  \n- Enemy body? No.  \n- Safe? Yes.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy possible moves & head-on collisions\n\nEnemy head at (2, 0). Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP to (2, 1) \u2192 its own body \u2192 no.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 no.  \n- LEFT to (1, 0) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT to (3, 0) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo enemy can go LEFT or RIGHT: possible next heads (1, 0), (3, 0).  \n\nMy possible next heads:  \n- DOWN (8, 5) \u2014 no overlap.  \n- LEFT (7, 6) \u2014 no overlap.  \n- RIGHT (9, 6) \u2014 no overlap.  \n\nNo head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple proximity\n\nApples: (9, 4), (4, 9), (8, 0), (4, 2), (0, 3).\n\n- DOWN (8, 5): closest apple (9, 4) distance |8-9|+|5-4| = 2. Also (8, 0) dist 5.\n- LEFT (7, 6): closest apple (4, 9) dist |7-4|+|6-9| = 6. (9, 4) dist 4.\n- RIGHT (9, 6): closest apple (9, 4) dist 2. Also (8, 0) dist 7.\n\nRIGHT and DOWN both closest to (9, 4) with dist 2.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility\n\nFrom each safe next head:\n\n**DOWN (8, 5)**  \nNext turn from (8, 5): UP (8, 6) safe? That\u2019s current head location \u2014 will be empty next turn because I move. DOWN (8, 4) safe. LEFT (7, 5) safe. RIGHT (9, 5) safe. All 4 moves open.\n\n**LEFT (7, 6)**  \nNext turn from (7, 6): UP (7, 7) safe? My body currently at (7, 7) \u2014 tail will move to (2, 6) if no apple eaten \u2192 (7, 7) will be free next turn. DOWN (7, 5) safe. LEFT (6, 6) safe. RIGHT (8, 6) safe. All 4 moves open.\n\n**RIGHT (9, 6)**  \nNext turn from (9, 6): UP (9, 7) safe. DOWN (9, 5) safe. LEFT (8, 6) safe. RIGHT (10, 6) off-board \u2192 so only 3 safe moves next turn.\n\nSo RIGHT reduces future options because I\u2019d be on right edge.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Enemy threat\n\nEnemy is far away (2, 0). Moving toward (0, 3) or (4, 2) apples possibly. No immediate threat to my area.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Decision\n\nDOWN and LEFT both keep 4 moves next turn. RIGHT only 3 moves.  \nDOWN is closer to (9, 4) apple than LEFT (dist 2 vs 4).  \nAlso DOWN moves toward (9, 4), which is on right side, but next turn from (8, 5) I can go RIGHT to (9, 5) or DOWN to (8, 4) to approach it.\n\nLEFT moves me away from the nearest apple cluster.\n\nBetter to go DOWN now, then next turn go RIGHT or DOWN toward (9, 4).\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 5), consider moving toward apple (9, 4) \u2014 RIGHT (9, 5) or DOWN (8, 4). Keep mobility high, avoid right edge until necessary.\n\nDOWN",

No.  \n- Safe? Yes.\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (9, 4)  \n- Inside board? Yes.  \n- My body? No.  \n- Enemy body? No.  \n- Contains apple? Yes \u2014 apple at (9, 4). Moving here would eat it.  \n- Safe? Yes.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy possible moves & head-on collisions\n\nEnemy head at (0, 0). Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP to (0, 1) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 no.  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 no.  \n- RIGHT to (1, 0) \u2192 its own body \u2192 no.  \n\nSo enemy can only go UP to (0, 1).\n\nMy possible next heads:  \n- DOWN (8, 3) \u2014 no overlap.  \n- LEFT (7, 4) \u2014 no overlap.  \n- RIGHT (9, 4) \u2014 no overlap.\n\nNo head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple proximity\n\nApples: (9, 4), (4, 9), (8, 0), (4, 2), (0, 3).\n\n- RIGHT (9, 4) \u2192 on apple immediately.\n- DOWN (8, 3) \u2192 closest apple (8, 0) dist 3, (9, 4) dist 2.\n- LEFT (7, 4) \u2192 closest apple (4, 2) dist 5, (9, 4) dist 3.\n\nRIGHT eats apple instantly.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility after each safe move\n\n**RIGHT (9, 4)** \u2013 Eat apple, grow by 1.  \nAfter eating, my body will be: head at (9, 4), then old head (8, 4), then (8, 5), etc. Tail stays same length because eating adds segment next turn.  \nFrom (9, 4) next turn:  \nUP (9, 5) safe? Yes, empty now.  \nDOWN (9, 3) safe? Yes, empty.  \nLEFT (8, 4) safe? That\u2019s old head \u2014 will be empty next turn (since I moved).  \nRIGHT off board \u2192 so 3 moves next turn (UP, DOWN, LEFT). On edge.\n\n**DOWN (8, 3)** \u2013 No apple eaten.  \nFrom (8, 3) next turn:  \nUP (8, 4) safe? That\u2019s current head location \u2014 empty next turn.  \nDOWN (8, 2) safe? Yes.  \nLEFT (7, 3) safe? Yes.  \nRIGHT (9, 3) safe? Yes.  \nAll 4 moves open.\n\n**LEFT (7, 4)** \u2013 No apple eaten.  \nFrom (7, 4) next turn:  \nUP (7, 5) safe? Yes.  \nDOWN (7, 3) safe? Yes.  \nLEFT (6, 4) safe? Yes.  \nRIGHT (8, 4) safe? Yes (empty next turn).  \nAll 4 moves open.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Risk vs reward\n\nEating apple now is good for score (I lead 8 vs 6). But being at (9, 4) next turn reduces moves to 3, though still safe.  \nEnemy far away, no immediate threat.\n\nEating apple now might let me plan path to other apples next turn. Also, if enemy later gets near, having more length can be useful defensively but risks self-collision later. My length is 9 segments now (head + 8 body). Eating makes it 10.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Decision\n\nRIGHT eats apple instantly, gets point, still safe.  \nLEFT and DOWN keep more mobility but delay eating.\n\nGiven enemy is far and I want to increase score lead, RIGHT seems best. The only downside is slightly reduced mobility next turn, but still 3 safe moves, which is fine.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9, 4) after eating, avoid RIGHT (off board). Choose among UP, DOWN, LEFT to stay safe and maybe aim for (8, 0) or (4, 9) later. Keep monitoring enemy movement toward left-side apples.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Yes.  \nRIGHT off board \u2192 no.  \nSo 3 moves next turn.\n\n**LEFT (8, 3)**  \nFrom (8, 3) next turn:  \nUP (8, 4) safe? No \u2014 my body will be at (8, 4) still? Let\u2019s trace: my body moves forward one cell, so neck (9, 4) becomes head if I go LEFT, tail stays at (5, 8). So (8, 4) is empty next turn? Wait:  \nCurrent body: (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), \u2026  \nIf I move LEFT to (8, 3), new body becomes [(8, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), \u2026]. So (8, 4) is occupied next turn? Yes, it\u2019s the third segment. So UP from (8, 3) goes to (8, 4) which is my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (8, 2) safe? Yes.  \nLEFT (7, 3) safe? Yes.  \nRIGHT (9, 3) safe? Yes (empty next turn).  \nSo 3 moves next turn as well.\n\nBoth give same immediate future move count.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Long-term planning\n\nApple (9, 1) is one step away if I go DOWN now and DOWN next turn. That\u2019s a quick score.  \nEnemy is far left and likely going for (0, 3) apple. I should grab (9, 1) safely while keeping options open.  \nLEFT moves me toward center but away from immediate apple. DOWN gets apple next turn and then I can go left toward (8, 0) or (4, 2) after.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9, 2), move DOWN to (9, 1) to eat apple, unless enemy somehow threatens. Then plan path to (8, 0) or (4, 2) while avoiding dead ends.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",

It also removes that apple, reducing clutter.  \nAfter eating, I\u2019ll be at (9, 1) with only DOWN and LEFT safe next turn. That\u2019s riskier, but I can plan:  \n- If I go DOWN to (9, 1), then next turn I can go DOWN to (9, 0) or LEFT to (8, 1).  \n- (9, 0) is near apple (8, 0) \u2192 could be a good path.  \n- I must avoid trapping myself in bottom-right corner.\n\nEnemy is far away and likely heading for (0, 4) area or apple (1, 5). No immediate threat.\n\nEating now is valuable for score lead and reduces apple count for enemy.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating (9, 1), assess from (9, 1): likely go DOWN to (9, 0) then LEFT toward (8, 0) apple, or LEFT to (8, 1) to open space.

Immediate safety check\n\n**UP** \u2192 (9, 2)  \n- Inside board: Yes.  \n- Occupied by my body? Yes, first body segment (9, 2) \u2192 unsafe.  \n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (9, 0)  \n- Inside board: Yes.  \n- My body? No.  \n- Enemy body? No.  \n- Safe? Yes.  \n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (8, 1)  \n- Inside board: Yes.  \n- My body? No.  \n- Enemy body? No.  \n- Safe? Yes.  \n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (10, 1) \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n\n**Safe moves:** DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy possible moves & head-on collision risk\n\nEnemy head at (1, 3). Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP to (1, 4) \u2014 empty.  \n- DOWN to (1, 2) \u2014 empty.  \n- LEFT to (0, 3) \u2014 its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe for it.  \n- RIGHT to (2, 3) \u2014 has apple, but my body not there.  \n\nSo enemy can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.  \n\nMy possible next heads:  \n- DOWN (9, 0) \u2014 far from enemy.  \n- LEFT (8, 1) \u2014 far from enemy.  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple proximity\n\nFrom (9, 1):  \n- DOWN (9, 0) \u2192 no apple.  \n- LEFT (8, 1) \u2192 no apple.  \n\nClosest apple to (9, 1) is (8, 0) distance 2 via DOWN then LEFT or LEFT then DOWN.  \nAlso (4, 2) and (2, 3) are farther.  \n\nNo immediate apple in one move.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility\n\n**DOWN (9, 0)** \u2014 no apple eaten, body shifts:  \nNew body: [(9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8)] (tail (6, 8) gone)  \nFrom (9, 0) next turn:  \nUP to (9, 1) \u2192 occupied by my second segment \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT to (8, 0) \u2192 apple there \u2192 safe and beneficial.  \nRIGHT off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo only 1 safe move next turn (LEFT to (8, 0) apple).  \n\n**LEFT (8, 1)** \u2014 no apple eaten:  \nNew body: [(8, 1), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8)]  \nFrom (8, 1) next turn:  \nUP to (8, 2) \u2192 empty.  \nDOWN to (8, 0) \u2192 apple \u2192 safe.  \nLEFT to (7, 1) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT to (9, 1) \u2192 occupied by my second segment \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nLEFT gives much better future mobility.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Long-term planning\n\nGoing DOWN to (9, 0) traps me next turn \u2014 only one move (LEFT to apple (8, 0)), but after eating that apple, I\u2019ll grow and be at (8, 0) with body behind me. That could be risky if enemy approaches later, but enemy is far now.  \n\nGoing LEFT to (8, 1) keeps options open: next turn I can go DOWN to (8, 0) apple, UP to (8, 2), or LEFT to (7, 1). This is safer and more flexible.  \n\nGiven enemy is far and I have a 3-apple lead, maintaining mobility is key to eventually collecting more apples safely.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 1), go DOWN to eat (8, 0) apple, then assess. Avoid moving back into crowded right side unless necessary.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Immediate death checks for each move  \n\n**UP** \u2192 (8,1) \u2192 That\u2019s currently part of my body? Wait, check body list:  \nMy body: [(8,1), (9,1), (9,2), \u2026]. Yes, (8,1) is my second segment. Moving into own body \u2192 death.  \n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (8,-1) \u2192 off the board (y < 0) \u2192 death.  \n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (7,0) \u2192 Check if any snake occupies:  \nBoard shows at (7,0) a \u2018T\u2019 (my own tail? Let\u2019s check my body list end: tail is at (7,8)? No, tail is last body segment: (7,8) is last, so (7,0) is empty? Wait, look at board: column 7 row 0: from diagram:  \nRow 0: \"T T T . . . . . 1 .\" \u2192 columns 0=T, 1=T, 2=T, 3=., 4=., 5=., 6=., 7=., 8=1, 9=.  \nSo (7,0) is empty. Enemy snake #0 body: ends at (2,0), so not in (7,0).  \nSo (7,0) is safe? But need to check enemy head movement risk.  \n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (9,0) \u2192 Check board: row 0 col 9 = '.' empty. My body not there. Enemy body not there. Safe? But enemy head at (3,3) cannot reach (9,0) in one move.  \n\nSo immediately safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT. UP and DOWN are lethal.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Check for head-on collisions with enemy snake #0  \n\nEnemy head at (3,3). Possible enemy moves: UP\u2192(3,4) (apple), DOWN\u2192(3,2), LEFT\u2192(2,3), RIGHT\u2192(4,3).  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,0), enemy can\u2019t reach (9,0) in one move \u2192 no head-on risk.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (7,0), enemy can\u2019t reach (7,0) in one move \u2192 no head-on risk.  \n\nSo both LEFT and RIGHT avoid immediate head-on collision.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Future safety & apples  \n\nApples: (4,9), (4,2), (1,5), (3,4), (9,8).  \n\nFrom (8,0):  \n- LEFT to (7,0) \u2192 closer to apple at (1,5) maybe, but far. Also near enemy snake at (3,3)? Actually enemy occupies cols 0\u20133 mostly. Going left into column 7 then 6 etc. might be fine short term.  \n- RIGHT to (9,0) \u2192 then possible to go UP later toward apple (9,8) but that\u2019s far up. Also going right puts me at right edge with only UP as next move (since DOWN off board, LEFT back to (8,0) occupied by my body next turn). That\u2019s risky: from (9,0) next turn only safe move might be UP to (9,1) but (9,1) is currently my body segment \u2014 but next turn my body moves forward so (9,1) might be empty? Let\u2019s simulate:  \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9,0), my new head at (9,0). My body shifts: old head (8,0) becomes neck, tail end (7,8) stays? Wait, no apple eaten so length same: new body = [(9,0), (8,0), (8,1), \u2026, last segment removed]. Last segment removed is (7,8). So (9,1) currently in body list as (9,1) \u2192 will it be removed? Let\u2019s check: current body length 12 segments (head + 11 body). After move without apple: new length still 12: head new pos, then old head, then old body except last segment removed.  \nSo old body list: (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7), (7,8).  \nAfter shift: new body: head=(9,0), then (8,0), then (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7). Tail removed: (7,8).  \n\nSo (9,1) is still occupied next turn! So from (9,0), UP to (9,1) is suicide next turn. Also RIGHT from (9,0) impossible (off board). DOWN off board. So only LEFT from (9,0) next turn, which goes back to (8,0) \u2014 but (8,0) will be my neck then, so also suicide. Conclusion: moving RIGHT to (9,0) leads to being trapped with no safe move next turn \u2192 certain death next turn.  \n\nSo RIGHT is not safe for future.  \n\nLEFT to (7,0): next turn from (7,0) possible moves: UP to (7,1) \u2014 check board: (7,1) currently \u2018T\u2019? Row 1 col 7: board shows row 1: \"T . . . . . . . T T\" \u2192 col 7 = \u2018.\u2019? Wait, row 1: index 0=T, 1=., 2=., 3=., 4=., 5=., 6=., 7=., 8=T, 9=T. So col 7 row 1 empty. But will my body be there next turn? My new body if move LEFT: head=(7,0), then (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), \u2026, remove last segment (7,8). So (7,1) is free. So UP from (7,0) next turn safe. Also LEFT from (7,0) to (6,0) is free (empty currently). Also DOWN off board. So next turn from (7,0) I\u2019d have UP and LEFT safe. That\u2019s better than RIGHT\u2019s zero safe moves.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Long-term plan note  \n\nLEFT seems only viable safe move now. Then move up column 7 toward apples possibly, avoid enemy area col 0\u20133. Try to get apple at (9,8) later by going right after moving up a bit, but careful of body.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Check possible moves from (7,1):**  \n\n- **UP** \u2192 (7,2):  \n  Check board: At (7,2) in board state: row 2 (y=2), column 7 (x=7) \u2192 board shows \u2018.\u2019 (empty).  \n  Not off board (y=2 within 0\u20139).  \n  Not in my body: My body coords: (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7) \u2192 no (7,2).  \n  Not in enemy body: enemy body coords listed above \u2192 no (7,2).  \n  Safe unless enemy head moves there simultaneously \u2014 check enemy head moves: enemy at (2,4) can move U/D/L/R:  \n    - Up: (2,5)  \n    - Down: (2,3) (occupied by enemy body) \u2192 invalid for them.  \n    - Left: (1,4)  \n    - Right: (3,4) (occupied by enemy body) \u2192 invalid for them.  \n  So enemy\u2019s possible safe moves: Up to (2,5), Left to (1,4).  \n  Enemy cannot reach (7,2) in one move from (2,4).  \n  So UP is safe from collision with enemy head this turn.  \n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (7,0):  \n  That\u2019s my body (second segment) \u2192 death. Eliminate.  \n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (6,1):  \n  Check board: row 1 (y=1), col 6 \u2192 board shows \u2018.\u2019 (empty).  \n  Not off board.  \n  Not in my body (list: no (6,1)).  \n  Not in enemy body.  \n  Enemy possible moves: (2,4) \u2192 (6,1) impossible in one move. Safe.  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8,1):  \n  That\u2019s my body (fourth segment) \u2192 death. Eliminate.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP and LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**2. Which is better strategically?**  \n\nApples nearby:  \n- (5,1) is at x=5,y=1 \u2014 from (7,1), LEFT twice gets there, but first LEFT to (6,1) then LEFT to (5,1) would be next turn. But (5,1) is close.  \n- (9,8) far away.  \n- (4,2) is x=4,y=2 \u2014 from (7,1), UP then LEFT\u00d73 maybe.  \n- (1,5) far.  \n- (4,9) far.  \n\nBut also need to consider future safe moves after moving.  \n\nFrom (7,2) (if UP): possible next moves: U/L/R (D would go back to (7,1) which might be occupied by tail later? Tail is at (8,7) currently, will move if we eat apple? We haven\u2019t eaten this turn, so tail stays at (8,7) next turn, so (7,1) will be empty next turn). Actually, tail moves forward if no apple eaten? Wait, in Snake, if no apple eaten, the tail moves forward (head moves, last segment removed). So current tail (8,7) will be removed next turn if no apple eaten, and new tail will be (8,6). So (7,1) will be empty next turn. So DOWN from (7,2) next turn is safe.  \n\nFrom (6,1) (if LEFT): possible next moves: U/D/L (RIGHT back to (7,1) empty next turn).  \n\nBoth have 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nBut (5,1) apple is closer if we go LEFT now: from (6,1) next turn, apple at (5,1) is adjacent LEFT. However, enemy snake is at (2,4), not close to (5,1) immediately.  \n\nBut also, enemy snake might go for (4,2) apple maybe.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Avoid dead ends:**  \nCheck board corners: My snake occupies right side heavily. Going UP from (7,1) keeps more central options. Going LEFT goes toward more open center.  \n\nBut look at board state: right column (x=9) has my body at (9,1)-(9,4), (9,2) etc. Actually from (7,2), up to (7,3) is empty, left to (6,2) empty. Seems fine.  \n\nActually, check if (7,2) is safe: yes.  \n\nLet\u2019s simulate enemy moves: enemy at (2,4) could go Up to (2,5) toward apple (1,5)? Or Left to (1,4) toward apple (4,2)? Not sure.  \n\nGiven I have 11 apples vs enemy 9, I\u2019m ahead. Main goal: stay alive, avoid risky head-on.  \n\nBoth UP and LEFT seem safe this turn and next.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Tie-breaker:**  \nGoing UP moves toward top where apple (4,9) is eventually, but also gets me away from my long body on right side.  \n\nGoing LEFT moves toward apple (5,1) quickly. That\u2019s a clear short-term gain.  \n\nEating apple grows my length, which could be risky if I trap myself later, but I can plan to loop around.  \n\nGiven I\u2019m longer, maybe better to eat apple sooner to end game faster? Game ends at 50 apples, I have 11, long way to go.  \n\nBut also, being longer means more body to avoid.  \n\nLet\u2019s check: If I go LEFT to (6,1), next turn apple at (5,1) is adjacent. I can eat it next turn if still there. Enemy might take (4,2) apple, not (5,1).  \n\nActually enemy could move: (2,4) \u2192 Left (1,4) \u2192 then Down (1,3) is its body, Up (1,5) apple, Right (2,4) back, so maybe enemy goes Up to (2,5) toward (1,5). So (5,1) safe from enemy next turn.  \n\nSo LEFT seems good for quick apple.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Long-term plan note:**  \nAfter eating (5,1), I\u2019ll be longer, need to avoid boxing self in right side. Consider moving up through center after eating.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move choice:**  \nLEFT",

T T .\" \u2192 x=0: T, x=1: ., x=2: ., x=3: ., x=4: ., x=5: ., x=6: ., x=7: T, x=8: T, x=9: .  \n  So (6,0) is '.' actually.  \n  Not in my body: my body has (7,0) and (8,0) but not (6,0) \u2192 safe from self.  \n  Not in enemy body: enemy body ends at (0,0) \u2192 no (6,0).  \n  Enemy head cannot reach (6,0) in one move.  \n  So DOWN is safe.  \n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,1):  \n  That\u2019s an apple (5,1)!  \n  Not off board.  \n  Not in my body \u2192 safe from self.  \n  Not in enemy body.  \n  Enemy head at (2,5) cannot reach (5,1) in one move \u2192 safe.  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,1):  \n  That\u2019s my body (second segment) \u2192 death. Eliminate.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy possible moves from (2,5):**  \nEnemy moves:  \nUP \u2192 (2,6) \u2013 board '.' at (2,6) (row 6 col 2 is '.'), not in its body, not my body.  \nDOWN \u2192 (2,4) \u2013 its own body \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT \u2192 (1,5) \u2013 apple, not in bodies, safe for them.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3,5) \u2013 board '.' at (3,5), safe.  \n\nSo enemy could go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (1,5), they eat apple and grow.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Evaluate safe moves for me:**  \n\n**LEFT (to (5,1))**:  \n- Immediate apple, grow to length 13.  \n- Next turn head at (5,1), body will be: new head (5,1) + old head (6,1) + old body except tail stays (since apple eaten, tail doesn\u2019t move). Tail currently at (8,6) stays.  \n- Danger: After eating, my body occupies (6,1) and (7,1) etc. From (5,1) next turn, safe moves? Possibly UP (5,2), DOWN (5,0), LEFT (4,1). RIGHT (6,1) will be my body \u2192 not safe. So 3 moves remain.  \n- Risk of trapping myself later? Not immediately.  \n\n**UP (to (6,2))**:  \n- No apple.  \n- Next turn head at (6,2), tail moves to (8,5) if no apple eaten.  \n- From (6,2) next turn, possible moves: UP (6,3), LEFT (5,2), RIGHT (7,2), DOWN (6,1) (will be empty then). So 4 moves.  \n- Lets me approach apple at (4,2) or (4,9) later.  \n\n**DOWN (to (6,0))**:  \n- No apple.  \n- Next turn head at (6,0), tail moves to (8,5).  \n- From (6,0) next turn: UP (6,1) (empty), LEFT (5,0), RIGHT (7,0) (my body then? Wait, (7,0) is my body now, but tail moves, so (7,0) will be empty next turn if no apple eaten? Actually if no apple eaten, tail moves from (8,6) to (8,5), so (7,0) stays occupied (since body segment at (7,0) doesn\u2019t move unless we ate apple earlier). Let\u2019s check: current body: head (6,1), then (7,1), (7,0), (8,0), ... If we move DOWN to (6,0), new head (6,0), old head (6,1) becomes body[1], then (7,1) body[2], (7,0) body[3], etc. Tail (8,6) removed if no apple. So (7,0) is still occupied next turn? Yes, because (7,0) is the 4th segment after moving. So RIGHT to (7,0) would be suicide next turn. So from (6,0) next turn safe moves: UP (6,1), LEFT (5,0). DOWN off board. So only 2 safe moves next turn. That\u2019s risky.  \n\nThus DOWN is less favorable due to fewer future options.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Compare UP vs LEFT:**  \n\nLEFT:  \n- Gain apple now, increase lead (12 vs 9 apples after enemy possibly eats (1,5)).  \n- But growth makes maneuvering harder.  \n- Still have 3 safe moves next turn from (5,1).  \n\nUP:  \n- No immediate gain, but more options next turn (4 safe moves).  \n- Lets me stay agile and possibly get (4,2) apple soon.  \n\nGiven my lead (11 vs 9), maybe better to stay agile and deny enemy chance to catch up by blocking or getting apples they want. Apple (1,5) is closer to enemy, they might get it. If I take (5,1), I\u2019m closer to center and can maybe go for (4,2) after.  \n\nBut UP seems safer long-term because it avoids growing too fast in a crowded right side.  \n\nActually, looking at board: my body occupies right side heavily. Moving LEFT gets me into more open area, but then I\u2019m near enemy if they go for (4,2). Enemy at (2,5) could go LEFT to (1,5) apple, then maybe DOWN/LEFT toward (4,2) later.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Head-on collision risk:**  \nEnemy could go UP to (2,6) or RIGHT to (3,5) or LEFT to (1,5). No head-on possible with my moves UP/DOWN/LEFT since they\u2019re far away.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nI think UP is the best balance of safety and future options. LEFT gives an apple but reduces next turn\u2019s options slightly. Given my lead, I should prioritize survival and flexibility.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (6,2), consider moving toward (4,2) apple via LEFT moves, while keeping an eye on enemy\u2019s position. Avoid getting trapped in right side.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

Not in my body [(6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (8,4)] \u2192 safe. Not in enemy body [(1,5), (1,4), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1)] \u2192 safe.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5,1): Apple there. Not off board. Not in my body \u2192 safe. Not in enemy body \u2192 safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4,2): Apple there. Not off board. Not in my body \u2192 safe. Not in enemy body \u2192 safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,2): My body segment (second segment) \u2192 death.  \n\nSo safe: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy head at (1,4)** possible moves:  \nUP (1,5) \u2014 its own body? Wait, enemy body: first segment after head is (1,5)? Actually looking at enemy body list: [(1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1)].  \nSo (1,5) is enemy\u2019s neck \u2192 UP to (1,5) is into its own body \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN (1,3) \u2014 enemy body segment? Yes, (1,3) is in enemy body \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT (0,4) \u2014 free '.' \u2192 valid.  \nRIGHT (2,4) \u2014 enemy body segment? Yes, (2,4) is in enemy body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is LEFT to (0,4).  \n\nThat means enemy will be at (0,4) next turn, far from my possible positions (5,3), (5,1), (4,2). No head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nApples: (4,9), (4,2), (9,8), (5,1), (6,7).  \nFrom my head (5,2):  \n- (5,1) is DOWN (distance 1).  \n- (4,2) is LEFT (distance 1).  \nBoth are reachable in one move.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (5,1), I eat apple \u2192 grow to length 13, tail stays at (8,4) (no tail movement).  \nIf I go LEFT to (4,2), I eat apple \u2192 grow to length 13.  \n\n---\n\n**Future options after eating apple:**  \nEating apple means my tail doesn\u2019t move this turn, so my body occupies the same cells next turn except head moves.  \n\n**DOWN to (5,1):**  \nNext turn head at (5,1), body: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (8,4)].  \nFrom (5,1), possible moves: UP (back to (5,2) \u2014 body), DOWN (5,0) \u2014 free, LEFT (4,1) \u2014 free, RIGHT (6,1) \u2014 body. So only DOWN and LEFT safe. That\u2019s only 2 safe moves, risky.  \n\n**LEFT to (4,2):**  \nNext turn head at (4,2), body: [(5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (8,4)].  \nFrom (4,2), possible moves: UP (4,3) \u2014 free, DOWN (4,1) \u2014 free, LEFT (3,2) \u2014 free, RIGHT (5,2) \u2014 body. So UP, DOWN, LEFT safe (3 options). Better.  \n\n**UP to (5,3):** (no apple eaten)  \nNext turn head at (5,3), tail moves to (6,2) (oldest body gone). Body: [(5,2), (6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (8,4)]? Wait, careful: current body after moving head to (5,3) without apple: head (5,3), then previous head (5,2) becomes new segment 2, then old body[1]=(6,2) becomes segment 3, old body[2]=(6,1) segment 4, etc., tail (8,4) moves to old body[10]? Actually snake length 12 now, so after moving without apple: head new at (5,3), then (5,2), then (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), tail (9,4)? Wait, my current body: head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), tail (8,4). So tail is (8,4). After moving without apple: head to (5,3), add (5,2) as segment 2, shift everything, remove tail (8,4). So new body: (5,3), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). Tail is (9,4).  \nFrom (5,3) next turn: UP (5,4) free, DOWN (5,2) body, LEFT (4,3) free, RIGHT (6,3) free \u2192 3 safe moves. But no apple eaten, so score doesn\u2019t increase.  \n\n---\n\n**Risk:**  \nEating apple grows length but also reduces future mobility if I trap myself. DOWN to (5,1) leaves only 2 moves next turn, which could be dangerous. LEFT to (4,2) gives 3 moves and eats apple. UP gives 3 moves but no apple.  \n\nGiven enemy only can move to (0,4), they are far from apples (4,2) and (5,1). I can safely take one.  \n\nI prefer **LEFT** to (4,2) because:  \n1. Eat apple \u2192 score +1.  \n2. More options next turn (3 moves) than DOWN.  \n3. Moves me away from my crowded right-side body.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (4,2), assess moves UP/DOWN/LEFT toward remaining apples (4,9) or (6,7), but prioritize keeping options open. Avoid moving back into my body at (5,2) unless safe.  \n\nLEFT",

Safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,1): Board shows \u2018.\u2019 at (4,1). Not off board. Not in my body. Not in enemy body. Safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,2): Board shows \u2018.\u2019 at (3,2). Not off board. Not in my body. Not in enemy body. Safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,2): My body\u2019s first segment (neck) \u2192 death.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy snake #0 head:** (0,4)  \nEnemy body: [(1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (0,3), (0,2)]  \n\nPossible moves from (0,4):  \n- UP \u2192 (0,5): Not off board, not in enemy body (check list: (0,5) not there), not in my body \u2192 safe for enemy.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0,3): In enemy body (segment (0,3) is there) \u2192 death for enemy.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (-1,4): Off board \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,4): In enemy body (neck) \u2192 death.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is UP to (0,5).  \n\nThus enemy will be at (0,5) next turn \u2014 far from my possible moves. No head-on risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity from (4,2):**  \n- (5,1): distance |4-5|+|2-1| = 2 steps (DOWN then RIGHT, but RIGHT from (4,2) is unsafe now).  \n- (4,9): vertical distance 7.  \n- (6,7): distance |4-6|+|2-7| = 2+5=7.  \n- (9,8): distance 5+6=11.  \n- (8,9): distance 4+7=11.  \n\nClosest reachable apples: (5,1) is 2 steps away, but requires going DOWN now to (4,1) then RIGHT to (5,1) next turn (if safe).  \n\n---\n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n\n1. **UP to (4,3)** (no apple):  \n   Next turn body: head (4,3), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), tail (9,4)? Wait, length is 13 now because I ate last turn, so tail stays at (8,4) this turn? Let\u2019s check: last turn I ate apple at (4,2), so this turn my length is 13, tail didn\u2019t move. So after moving UP without apple: new head at (4,3), add (4,2) as segment 2, shift all, remove tail (8,4). New tail becomes (9,4). Body: (4,3), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4).  \n   From (4,3) next turn:  \n   UP (4,4): free.  \n   DOWN (4,2): body (segment 2) \u2192 unsafe.  \n   LEFT (3,3): free.  \n   RIGHT (5,3): free.  \n   So 3 safe moves.  \n\n2. **DOWN to (4,1)** (no apple):  \n   Next turn body: head (4,1), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). Tail gone: (8,4) removed.  \n   From (4,1) next turn:  \n   UP (4,2): body \u2192 unsafe.  \n   DOWN (4,0): free.  \n   LEFT (3,1): free.  \n   RIGHT (5,1): apple there, but is it safe? Check: (5,1) not in body above \u2014 yes free. So 3 safe moves. Actually RIGHT to (5,1) is safe and eats apple. So DOWN now gives good options next turn.  \n\n3. **LEFT to (3,2)** (no apple):  \n   Next turn body: head (3,2), then (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4).  \n   From (3,2) next turn:  \n   UP (3,3): free.  \n   DOWN (3,1): free.  \n   LEFT (2,2): free.  \n   RIGHT (4,2): body \u2192 unsafe.  \n   So 3 safe moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple strategy:**  \n(5,1) is reachable in two steps: DOWN now \u2192 (4,1), then RIGHT next turn to (5,1) eats apple if still there and safe.  \n(6,7) is far.  \n(4,9) is far but could be long-term goal.  \n\n---\n\n**Risk:** No immediate head-on collision. All three moves give 3 safe moves next turn. DOWN sets up apple (5,1) next turn. UP and LEFT keep central position.  \n\nI think **DOWN** to (4,1) is best because:  \n- It moves toward apple (5,1) for next turn.  \n- It stays clear of my body cluster on right.  \n- From (4,1), next turn I can go RIGHT to (5,1) for apple, or DOWN/LEFT if needed.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (4,1), assess moves toward (5,1) if apple still there and safe. Keep options open, avoid trapping myself near top right body.  \n\nDOWN",

The apples at (8,9) and (9,8) seem far. The apple at (6, 7) looks interesting.\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 7), then I could go UP to (0, 8) or LEFT to ( -1, 7) which is death , or DOWN to (0,6) which is into my body or RIGHT to (1,7) which is back into the square I came from. So LEFT looks bad this turn.\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 7), then I could go UP to (2, 8) or RIGHT to (3,7) or DOWN to (2,6).\n\nLet's think about the apple at (6,7). If I go RIGHT to (2,7), then if there are no collisions, my next move could be to (3,7), (2,8), (2,6).\n\nIt looks like if I want to get to the apple at (6,7) within the next couple of turns, I want to avoid going UP.

Staying flexible is key.  \nFrom (1,2), I can go UP toward (6,7) or (4,9) via left side, avoiding enemy body near (3,3)-(2,4)-(2,5).  \nMoving UP also keeps distance from enemy head currently at (1,7).  \nAvoid moving into bottom row where my body occupies (7,0),(8,0) etc.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,2), if safe, go UP or LEFT to continue toward upper apples while monitoring enemy movement.

So DOWN doesn't seem optimal.\nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 7), I eat an apple.\n\nSnake 1 is at (3,3). So I want to avoid there. Snake 1 could go UP to (3,4), LEFT to (2,3), RIGHT to (4,3), or DOWN to (3,2). If it goes UP to (3,4), there is no immediate collision with me.\n\nIt looks like the best move is RIGHT to get the apple.\n\nMy plan is to grab the (6,7) apple and then head upwards to compete for the apples at (4,9) and (8,9).

Its possible moves: UP (5,8) empty, DOWN (5,6) empty, LEFT (4,7) its own body, RIGHT (6,7) is an apple. Enemy can move UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk (my head far from enemy head).\n\n**Future mobility check** (next turn safe moves from each candidate):\n\n- **UP to (3,4)**: Next turn moves: UP (3,5) empty, DOWN (3,3) will be empty, LEFT (2,4) empty, RIGHT (4,4) empty \u2192 4 safe moves.\n- **DOWN to (3,2)**: Next turn moves: UP (3,3) empty, DOWN (3,1) our body? (3,1) is in our body list \u2192 unsafe, LEFT (2,2) empty, RIGHT (4,2) our body? (4,2) is in our body list \u2192 unsafe.

RIGHT moves toward right-side apples (6,7) etc.\n\n**Risk assessment**:  \nEnemy snake is at (5,7), can move UP toward (4,9) or RIGHT onto apple (6,7). If I go UP, I might converge with enemy near row 7\u20139 later. But currently we are far apart. UP gives most options next turn, which is good for flexibility.\n\n**Plan for next few turns**:  \nMove UP to (3,4), then likely continue UP toward (3,5), (3,6) to approach (6,7) from left side, avoiding column 4\u20135 where enemy is. Keep monitoring enemy head movement. Avoid getting boxed in by own body.\n\n**Final move**: UP",

I\u2019d get there next turn if I go RIGHT now.  \nBut is (5, 5) safe next turn? Let\u2019s check: enemy possible heads this turn: (6, 9), (5, 8), (7, 8). None is (5, 5). So apple still there next turn if I go RIGHT now.  \nHowever, if enemy goes LEFT to (5, 8), then next turn it could move DOWN to (5, 7), still not at (5, 5).

Eating it grows me, extends my body, but may block some space later. Still, gaining apple advantage over enemy (12 vs 11 \u2192 13 vs 11) is good.\n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \n\nRIGHT gives:  \n- Immediate safety  \n- Best apple proximity  \n- Good next-turn mobility  \n- No head-on collision risk with enemy this turn or next at apple cell  \n- Puts me closer to other apples on right/top later.\n\nUP and LEFT are safe but don\u2019t get apple as fast.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nAfter eating (5, 5), consider moving toward (4, 9) or (8, 9) while avoiding boxing myself in. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s position (6, 8) \u2013 it may move toward top apples too.\n\nRIGHT",

Eliminate deadly moves  \n\n**LEFT to (6,5)**: My own body occupies (6,5) (second segment). That\u2019s fatal. \u274c  \n\n**RIGHT to (8,5)**: Board shows (8,5) = apple \u2018A\u2019. Enemy snake #0 is far away. Is there any enemy body there? Enemy body:  \nSnake #0 body: [(8,9),(7,9),(6,9),(6,8),(6,7),(5,7),(4,7),(3,7),(2,7),(1,7),(1,6),(0,6)] \u2014 none at (8,5). My own body: no. On board? Yes (x=8, y=5). \u2705  \n\n**UP to (7,6)**: Board shows (7,6) = \u2018.\u2019 empty. Check my body: My body: [(6,5),(5,5),(4,5),(3,5),(3,4),(3,3),(2,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1)] \u2014 no (7,6). Enemy body: no. \u2705  \n\n**DOWN to (7,4)**: Board shows (7,4) = \u2018.\u2019 empty. My body: no. Enemy body: no. \u2705  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Consider apples and enemy head movement  \n\nApples: (4,9), (9,8), (5,1), (8,5), (2,8)  \n\n- **RIGHT (8,5)** is an apple \u2014 eating it grows me immediately, score to 14.  \n- **UP (7,6)** \u2014 not an apple, but maybe safer path?  \n- **DOWN (7,4)** \u2014 not an apple, moves me away from most apples.  \n\nEating apple is good for score, but must check if enemy could kill me there.  \n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (9,9). Possible moves from (9,9): UP off board \u274c, DOWN to (9,8) (apple), LEFT to (8,9) (its own body second segment), RIGHT off board \u274c. So enemy\u2019s only safe move is DOWN to (9,8).  \n\nSo enemy will move to (9,8) this turn. That\u2019s far from (8,5). No risk of head-on collision.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Future options after each safe move  \n\n**RIGHT to (8,5)** \u2014 eat apple, grow longer. Next turn head at (8,5): possible moves: UP (8,6), DOWN (8,4), LEFT (7,5) (occupied by my old neck now at (6,5)? Wait, after move RIGHT, my body shifts: new head (8,5), old head (7,5) becomes neck, (6,5) still body, etc.) Actually, after growth: new segment added at tail end? In Snake, growth means tail stays same length, head moves forward, new segment appears at tail after move? Actually, in this game: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\" \u2014 means after moving onto apple, at end of turn, your tail doesn\u2019t move, so length increases by 1. So next turn my body: head (8,5), neck (7,5), then (6,5), etc. So from (8,5), LEFT to (7,5) would be into my neck \u2014 deadly next turn. So from (8,5) safe moves next turn: UP (8,6), DOWN (8,4), RIGHT (9,5). Three options.  \n\n**UP to (7,6)** \u2014 no apple. Next turn from (7,6): possible moves UP (7,7), DOWN (7,5) (neck), LEFT (6,6), RIGHT (8,6). DOWN deadly, so 3 options.  \n\n**DOWN to (7,4)** \u2014 no apple. Next turn from (7,4): UP (7,5) neck deadly, DOWN (7,3), LEFT (6,4), RIGHT (8,4) \u2192 3 options.  \n\nAll give 3 options next turn, but RIGHT gets apple now.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Long-term considerations  \n\nEnemy snake #0 will be at (9,8) next turn. That\u2019s near apple (9,8) \u2014 it will eat it and grow.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,5), I\u2019m close to apple (9,8) but enemy will eat it this turn, so it\u2019s gone next turn. I\u2019ll be at (8,5) with enemy at (9,8). That could be dangerous if enemy tries to move west toward me, but enemy\u2019s only safe move from (9,8) next turn? Let\u2019s check quickly: from (9,8), possible moves: UP (9,9) empty? Actually after enemy moves down to (9,8), its old head (9,9) becomes neck, so UP into neck deadly, DOWN (9,7), LEFT (8,8), RIGHT off board. So safe: DOWN or LEFT. LEFT (8,8) is far from me at (8,5). So likely safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** RIGHT gets apple, is safe this turn, and keeps future options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (8,5) and eating apple, avoid moving left into neck next turn. Consider moving UP/RIGHT/DOWN to maneuver toward remaining apples (4,9) or (5,1), while watching enemy movement from (9,8).  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Future options after each safe move  \n\n**RIGHT (9,5)**: Next turn from (9,5):  \nUP (9,6), DOWN (9,4), LEFT (8,5) (my neck? Wait: after moving RIGHT, my new head (9,5), neck (8,5), so LEFT into neck deadly next turn). So safe next turn: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (off board deadly). So only 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**UP (8,6)**: Next turn from (8,6):  \nUP (8,7), DOWN (8,5) (neck), LEFT (7,6), RIGHT (9,6). DOWN deadly \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n**DOWN (8,4)**: Next turn from (8,4):  \nUP (8,5) (neck), DOWN (8,3), LEFT (7,4), RIGHT (9,4). UP deadly \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nSo UP and DOWN keep more options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Long-term plan  \n\nApples:  \n- (6,6) is close to UP path from (8,6) in 2 moves.  \n- (5,1) far south.  \n- (4,9) far north.  \n- (2,8) far left.  \n- (9,1) far south-east.  \n\nEnemy is at (9,8) and will likely move toward (8,8) or (9,7). If enemy goes (8,8), it\u2019s moving toward center, possibly toward apples (6,6) or (4,9).  \n\nFrom (8,6), I can go UP/LEFT toward (6,6) apple next turn.  \n\nFrom (8,4), I\u2019m farther from most apples except (5,1) but that\u2019s 4+ moves away.  \n\n---\n\n**Best choice:** UP to (8,6) \u2192 keeps 3 options, moves toward apple (6,6), away from enemy currently at (9,8).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,6), consider moving UP to (8,7) or LEFT to (7,6) to approach (6,6) apple, while checking enemy\u2019s new position after this turn. Avoid moving into my own neck (8,5). Watch for enemy head possibly at (8,8) or (9,7).  \n\nUP",

Future options after each safe move  \n\n**UP to (8,7)**:  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (8,7) this turn \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 both die \u274c.  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (7,8), then (8,7) is safe this turn.  \nNext turn from (8,7): UP (8,8) enemy? maybe empty, DOWN (8,6) my neck? Wait: after moving UP, my neck is (8,6), so DOWN deadly. LEFT (7,7) empty, RIGHT (9,7) empty. So 2 safe moves next turn if no enemy there.\n\n**LEFT to (7,6)**:  \nEnemy cannot reach (7,6) this turn (max move from (8,8) to (7,8)). Safe this turn.  \nNext turn from (7,6): UP (7,7), DOWN (7,5) my body? my body: (8,5), (7,5) is my 3rd segment? Actually body: [(8,5), (7,5), \u2026] so (7,5) is occupied by my body \u2192 deadly. LEFT (6,6) apple? yes apple at (6,6), RIGHT (8,6) my neck? Wait: after moving LEFT to (7,6), neck is (8,6), so RIGHT deadly. So only UP and LEFT safe next turn.

That\u2019s risky.  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (7,8), then (8,7) safe. I can\u2019t know enemy\u2019s choice, but since I have a 1-apple lead, maybe avoid risking head-on collision.\n\nLEFT (7,6) is safe regardless of enemy move.  \nRIGHT (9,6) is safe regardless of enemy move.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Long-term plan  \n\nApple (6,6) is reachable in 2 moves via LEFT now then LEFT next turn. That\u2019s good.  \nEnemy is near (8,8) and might move toward (7,8) or (8,7). If enemy moves to (7,8), then (6,6) apple path could be contested next turn, but I\u2019d get there first if I go LEFT now then LEFT next turn.\n\nRIGHT (9,6) moves away from most apples except maybe (9,1) far down. Less useful.\n\nUP risks death if enemy moves DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Best choice:** LEFT to (7,6) \u2192 safe this turn, sets up next turn to grab apple at (6,6) with LEFT move (if enemy doesn\u2019t block), keeps options open.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7,6), consider moving LEFT to (6,6) to eat apple if enemy not blocking. Check enemy\u2019s new head position first. If enemy blocks, maybe go UP to (7,7) to stay safe and reposition.\n\nLEFT",

Only DOWN is safe.\nThe enemy snake is at (7, 6).\n\nIf I choose DOWN, I can approach the apples at (6,6), (5,1), (9,1) but I am also potentially blocking that route for the enemy snake. However I am also moving away from the apple at (2,8). It will take time to make my way back to that apple.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (7,6). If I go to (7,7), the enemy snake can move up to (7,7) and cause a head-on collision. That means me moving DOWN may mean a quick death if the opponent seeks my destruction.\n\nThe long term strategy is to:\n1) Move to (7,7) on this current turn.\n2) The direction of the next move depends on where the opponent goes from (7,6).\n3) If the opponent tries to go to (7,7) to collide, then I will prefer to go LEFT or RIGHT if they are safe. Otherwise I will not move DOWN into the opponent's desired collision position.\n4) If I am able to survive, I want to reach the apple at (2,8) as quickly as possible. To do that, it is important to move LEFT when it is possible to move LEFT.\n\nDOWN",

Apples and enemy movement\n\nApples: (4,9), (5,1), (2,8), (6,6), (9,1)  \n- LEFT (6,6) \u2192 apple there \u2192 I will eat it and grow by 1.  \n- UP (7,7) \u2192 no apple.\n\nEnemy #0 head at (7,8), body: [(8,8), (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7)]\n\nEnemy's possible moves from (7,8):  \n- UP (7,9) \u2192 its own body \u274c  \n- DOWN (7,7) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- LEFT (6,8) \u2192 board shows '.' empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT (8,8) \u2192 its own body \u274c  \n\nSo enemy can move DOWN to (7,7) or LEFT to (6,8).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Collision risk this turn\n\nIf I move UP to (7,7) and enemy moves DOWN to (7,7) \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 both die.  \nIf I move LEFT to (6,6) \u2192 enemy cannot reach (6,6) this turn \u2192 safe regardless.\n\nEating apple at (6,6) grows me, moves my head to apple cell, tail stays same length (since I grow by 1), so my body extends by 1 segment at head.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Future options after each safe move\n\n**LEFT to (6,6)** (eat apple):  \nNext turn head at (6,6). Possible moves:  \n- UP (6,7): enemy body at (6,7)? Yes, enemy segment at (6,7) \u2192 deadly \u274c  \n- DOWN (6,5): my body at (6,5)? Yes, my segment at (6,5) \u2192 deadly \u274c  \n- LEFT (5,6): empty '.' \u2705  \n- RIGHT (7,6): my neck at (7,6)? After move, neck is (7,6), but (7,6) is now empty (old head moved) \u2192 safe \u2705  \n\nSo after eating apple, next turn only LEFT and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**UP to (7,7)**:  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (6,8), then (7,7) safe this turn.  \nNext turn head at (7,7):  \n- UP (7,8): enemy head? No, enemy moved away from (7,8) possibly, but (7,8) is empty now? Wait, enemy's old head (7,8) moved, so (7,8) empty. But enemy body has (7,9), (8,8), etc. So (7,8) empty \u2705  \n- DOWN (7,6): my neck? After moving UP, neck is (7,6), but (7,6) empty \u2705  \n- LEFT (6,7): enemy body at (6,7)? Yes, enemy segment at (6,7) \u2192 deadly \u274c  \n- RIGHT (8,7): empty \u2705  \n\nSo next turn from (7,7) would have UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe (3 moves).\n\nBut UP (7,7) risks head-on collision if enemy moves DOWN (7,7).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Decision\n\nI have a 1-apple lead (14 vs 13). Risking head-on collision on UP move is dangerous.  \nLEFT move guarantees:  \n- Eat apple \u2192 lead 15 vs 13.  \n- Safe this turn.  \n- Next turn only 2 safe moves (LEFT to (5,6) or RIGHT to (7,6)), but that\u2019s okay because I can plan then.\n\nIf I take apple now, enemy might try to contest other apples, but I extend lead.\n\nUP move: if enemy chooses LEFT (6,8), then safe and more options next turn, but if enemy chooses DOWN (7,7), we both die \u2192 I lose my lead and possibly the game.\n\nGiven I\u2019m ahead, avoid unnecessary risk. Take the guaranteed apple.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,6) after eating apple:  \n- Check enemy\u2019s new head position.  \n- Safe moves: LEFT (5,6) or RIGHT (7,6).  \n- Prefer LEFT toward board center for more space, unless RIGHT is safer due to enemy position.  \n- Avoid moving into enemy body segments.\n\nLEFT",

Yes, my body: [(5,6), (6,6), ..., (4,5), ...] \u2014 (4,5) is in my body list. That\u2019s my own body segment.  \n  So DOWN would kill me.  \n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (3, 6)  \n  Check: My body? No. Enemy body? Not in list. Board empty? Grid shows row 6 col 3 is `.`.  \n  Looks safe from immediate collision.  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (5, 6)  \n  Check: My body: first segment after head is (5,6) \u2014 yes, that\u2019s my own neck.  \n  So RIGHT would kill me.  \n\nSo immediately safe moves: **LEFT** only.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. But must also consider enemy\u2019s possible moves and head-on collisions:  \n\nEnemy head at (9, 7).  \nPossible moves for enemy:  \n\n- UP \u2192 (9, 8) \u2014 its own body at (9,8)? Yes, enemy body list has (9,8). So enemy can\u2019t go UP.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 6) \u2014 empty? Grid row 6 col 9 is `.`. Not in enemy body (check: enemy body: (8,7), (7,7), ..., (4,7), no (9,6)). Possible.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 7) \u2014 enemy body at (8,7)? Yes, that\u2019s its own neck. So no.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board (10,7), impossible.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is DOWN to (9, 6).  \n\nNow check head-on collision: If I go LEFT to (3, 6), enemy goes DOWN to (9, 6) \u2014 no conflict.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Apples reachable:  \n\nApples at: (4,9), (5,1), (2,8), (9,1), (9,2).  \n\nFrom my new position (3, 6) after LEFT:  \nClosest apple maybe (2,8) or (4,9). But (4,9) requires moving right/up, but currently blocked by enemy body in between.  \n\nBut anyway, only one safe move this turn: **LEFT**.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (3,6), my body will shift forward one cell, so tail at (1,2) will disappear (since I didn\u2019t eat apple). My new head (3,6) is safe now.  \nNext turn, I can consider moving UP to (3,7) or DOWN to (3,5) or RIGHT to (4,6) (which will be empty now), or LEFT to (2,6).  \nTry to avoid moving into enemy body or my own body.  \nGoal: get to an apple safely. (2,8) could be target via (3,7) \u2192 (2,7) \u2192 (2,8), but need to check enemy\u2019s future moves.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",
