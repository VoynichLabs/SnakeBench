The target cell is empty, not occupied by any part of our snake, and no enemy head can reach it in this turn. It directly heads toward the apple at (2,8), keeps us on the same row where we have the most freedom, and leaves multiple safe follow\u2011up directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT) after the move.\n\n**Plan for the next few turns**  \n- Continue moving left along y=8 toward the apple at (2,8).  \n- Once we reach x=2, consider moving down to collect the apple at (0,7) or (1,2) while staying clear of the enemy\u2019s path.  \n- Keep the body from forming a tight loop; after each left move the tail vacates (9,9) and shifts forward, preserving space for future turns.  \n- Monitor enemy head positions; avoid moving into any cell that could become their new head after their simultaneous move.\n\nLEFT",

This is also safe and moves me directly toward the closest apple.\n\n**Best Move Analysis:**\nI have just collected the apple at (0,8) and now have a 2-apple lead over enemy snake #1. The closest remaining apple is at (2,8), which is 2 moves away. Both safe moves (UP and RIGHT) keep me alive. RIGHT moves me directly toward the apple at (2,8), which is the most strategic choice.

This would move back to my previous position, which is now empty since my body has moved forward.\n\n3. **LEFT to (1,9)** - Safe. This moves me to the left edge, closer to the apple at (1,9).\n\n4. **RIGHT to (3,9)** - Safe. This moves me toward the center of the board, potentially closer to the apple at (3,2).\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Current position: (2,9) with body [(2,8), (1,8), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6)]\n- Just collected apple at (2,9) - now have 6 apples\n- Apples remaining: (3,2), (1,2), (4,0), (1,9)\n- Enemy snake #1 at (3,6) with body [(3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (5,8)]\n- Lead: 6 apples vs 4 for enemy snake #1 (2-apple lead)\n- Game ends at 50 apples - still 44 apples away from victory\n\n**Apple Proximity Analysis:**\n- (1,9): Directly LEFT from current position - 1 move away\n- (3,2): Bottom-center, 7 moves away\n- (1,2): Bottom-left, 7 moves away\n- (4,0): Bottom-center, 9 moves away\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 Analysis:**\n- Head at (3,6), positioned below and to the right of me\n- Body extending upward and rightward\n- Not directly threatening my current position\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n\n**UP**: Invalid - cannot move off the board. Eliminated.\n\n**DOWN**: Safe but moves me away from the closest apple at (1,9). Would be moving backward into a less strategic position.\n\n**LEFT**: Moves me directly to the apple at (1,9). This is the closest apple and would extend my lead to 3 apples over enemy snake #1. This is the most immediate and strategic choice.\n\n**RIGHT**: Safe but moves me away from the closest apple and toward enemy snake #1's territory. Less optimal than LEFT.\n\n**Best Move Analysis:**\nThe apple at (1,9) is directly to my LEFT and is the closest apple. Moving LEFT immediately extends my lead to 3 apples, which is significant early in the game. All other safe moves are less optimal - DOWN moves me away from the apple, and RIGHT moves me toward enemy territory. LEFT is clearly the best choice.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\n- Move LEFT to (1,9) to collect the apple and extend the lead to 3 apples\n- After collecting (1,9), consider moving toward the bottom-left apple cluster (3,2), (1,2)\n- Maintain the lead and force enemy snake #1 to take riskier moves\n- Use the left edge position to maintain flexibility for future LEFT, UP, or RIGHT movements\n- Keep an eye on enemy snake #1's movements and avoid head-on collisions\n- Focus on collecting apples efficiently while maintaining safety\n\nLEFT",

This would move off the board (y=10 is outside the 0-9 range). This move is impossible.\n\n2. **DOWN to (1,8)** - Safe. This would move back to my previous position, which is now empty since my body has moved forward.\n\n3. **LEFT to (0,9)** - Safe. This moves me to the left edge, closer to the apple at (1,9).\n\n4. **RIGHT to (2,9)** - Safe. This moves me toward the center of the board, potentially closer to the apple at (3,2).\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Current position: (1,9) with body [(2,9), (2,8), (1,8), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6)]\n- Just collected apple at (1,9) - now have 7 apples\n- Apples remaining: (3,2), (1,2), (4,0)\n- Enemy snake #1 at (3,6) with body [(3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (5,8)]\n- Lead: 7 apples vs 4 for enemy snake #1 (3-apple lead)\n- Game ends at 50 apples - still 43 apples away from victory\n\n**Apple Proximity Analysis:**\n- (3,2): Bottom-center, 7 moves away\n- (1,2): Bottom-left, 7 moves away\n- (4,0): Bottom-center, 9 moves away\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 Analysis:**\n- Head at (3,6), positioned below and to the right of me\n- Body extending upward and rightward\n- Not directly threatening my current position\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n\n**UP**: Invalid - cannot move off the board. Eliminated.\n\n**DOWN**: Safe but moves me away from the center and toward the bottom edge. Would be moving backward into a less strategic position.\n\n**LEFT**: Safe but moves me to the left edge, away from the center where the remaining apples are located.\n\n**RIGHT**: Moves me toward the center of the board and the apple cluster at (3,2), (1,2), (4,0). This is the most strategic direction to pursue the remaining apples.\n\n**Best Move Analysis:**\nThe remaining apples are clustered in the bottom-center of the board. Moving RIGHT positions me better to access this cluster and maintain my lead. All other safe moves are less optimal - DOWN moves me backward, and LEFT moves me away from the apple cluster. RIGHT is clearly the best choice for positioning.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\n- Move RIGHT to (2,9) to position myself for the bottom-center apple cluster\n- After positioning, move toward the apple at (3,2) or (1,2)\n- Maintain the 3-apple lead and force enemy snake #1 to take riskier moves\n- Use the center position to maintain flexibility for future UP, LEFT, or RIGHT movements\n- Keep an eye on enemy snake #1's movements and avoid head-on collisions\n- Focus on collecting apples efficiently while maintaining safety\n\nRIGHT",

Moving DOWN brings us directly closer to the (3,2) apple (distance\u202f2) and leaves LEFT and RIGHT open for the next turn, preserving flexibility. Moving LEFT would also be safe but moves us away from that apple and toward the left wall, reducing future options. Moving RIGHT is farther from any apple. Therefore the move that best satisfies the growth\u2011and\u2011flexibility criteria is DOWN.\n\nPlan: Continue moving down toward the (3,2) apple while keeping LEFT and RIGHT open for the following turn, avoiding head\u2011on collisions and maintaining multiple safe continuations.\n\nDOWN",
