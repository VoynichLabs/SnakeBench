Board is empty except for apples. No bodies yet.\n\n**CHECKING MOVES:**\n\n- **UP:** (6,10) \u2192 Off the board! \u274c DEAD. No.\n- **DOWN:** (6,8) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT:** (5,9) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT:** (7,9) \u2192 Empty. Safe.\n\nSo UP is out. DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are all safe *immediately*.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Opponent at (8,8). Where can they go? UP (8,9) empty, DOWN (8,7) empty, LEFT (7,8) empty, RIGHT (9,8) empty. All safe for them too. They might go for nearest apple? Closest apple is at (7,6) or (9,4)? Actually (9,4) is far. They might go DOWN/LEFT towards center.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK:** If we go RIGHT to (7,9), could they go UP to (8,9)? No collision. If we go DOWN to (6,8), could they go LEFT to (7,8)? No collision. If we go LEFT to (5,9), they'd have to go two left to collide \u2014 impossible.\n\nSo no immediate head-on danger.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:** We want to box him in. He's in the top-right corner (8,8). We're at (6,9). If we move DOWN to (6,8), we're cutting off his potential move south-west. If we move LEFT to (5,9), we're staying high but not pressuring him directly. If we move RIGHT to (7,9), we're closer to him but also putting us in a risky spot if he moves up.\n\nBest move? Let's think: We want to dominate the board. Moving DOWN to (6,8) gives us more central position, opens future moves in all directions except up, and starts to create a barrier below him. Moving RIGHT to (7,9) pins him a little but leaves us with fewer escape routes next turn.\n\nChat, I'm feeling **DOWN** \u2014 it's safe, it gets us toward apples (there's one at (7,6) below eventually), and it starts controlling the space between us and him.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:** After moving down, aim to wrap around his left side, force him toward the wall. Keep our body as a fence. Grow by eating apples when safe, but priority is positioning over greed.\n\nFINAL MOVE:\n\nDOWN",

No bodies, no apples yet \u2014 time to be aggressive and corner this guy. Ready to box him? Let\u2019s think it through.\n\nQuick move scan (HEAD: 8,8)\n- UP \u2192 (8,9): safe (on top row). Puts me level with opponent but risks getting hemmed against top if I overcommit. \ud83e\udd14\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,7): safe. Keeps mobility and space below me. Good fallback.\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,8): safe. Aggressive \u2014 closes the gap toward the enemy and keeps 4-way options open. Perfect for pressuring. \ud83d\ude08\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,8): safe but hugs the right wall, reduces future options. Not ideal for boxing.\n\nImmediate-death eliminations? None \u2014 we\u2019re clear of walls and bodies. Nice.\n\nHead-on risk check: opponent (6,9) can go left (5,9), right (7,9), or down (6,8). None of those are the cells I\u2019d move into this turn for any of the four options, so no immediate mutual-head collision now. But I must avoid setting up an easy head-to-head next turn since scores are tied \u2014 we don\u2019t want a double-KO. \u2705\n\nWhy LEFT (7,8)?\n- It\u2019s the most aggressive but still safe choice: it closes distance to the rival without immediately forcing a head-to-head.\n- From (7,8) I keep multiple follow-up options (up/left/down/right), so I don\u2019t get trapped against edges.\n- I can pressure his top-row position (he can\u2019t go up) and threaten to cut off escape routes in the next couple moves while still having room to bail if he tries a risky snipe. \ud83d\ude0f\n- Going right or up would hug walls and reduce maneuverability; down is conservative. LEFT is the play that balances aggression and safety.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next turns):\n- After LEFT to (7,8), watch his move. If he drifts right/down into tighter space, pivot to (6,8) to cut him off and corner him against the top wall. If he tries to bait a head-on into (7,9), don\u2019t take it \u2014 instead fall back and force him into making the risky move. Keep at least two escape options open each turn. \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udd79\ufe0f\n\nLet\u2019s box him in and make him crash. You ready? LET\u2019S GO! \ud83d\udc4a\n\nLEFT",

No bodies, scores tied 0\u20130.\n\nMove checks:\n- UP \u2192 (7,9): safe but hugs the top row and reduces vertical escape. Gives him room to slip left/down.\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,7): safe and conservative \u2014 keeps options but doesn\u2019t close gap.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,8): safe but moves away and gives him initiative to take center.\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,8): safe. This moves INTO his current head cell (which is allowed because moves are simultaneous), aggressively closes distance and starts the box-in. No immediate same-cell head-on is possible this turn because adjacent heads can\u2019t both enter the same third cell in one move.\n\nWhy LEFT:\n- Aggressive playstyle \u2014 we want to pressure and shrink his available space. LEFT closes the gap and forces him to react.\n- We keep escape options after moving into (6,8): we can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT next turn depending on his response. So we\u2019re not committing to a dead-end yet.\n- Scores are tied, so we aren\u2019t trying to bait a suicide head-on \u2014 we\u2019re forcing positional mistakes instead. If he panics and moves into our body later, we win; if he swaps into our previous cell we still control the tempo.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Move LEFT now to close. Observe his move:\n  * If he retreats left/down, follow and cut access to the center, pushing him toward the wall.\n  * If he goes up (toward the top), mirror with UP/LEFT to trap him against the top edge.\n  * Always keep at least two escape options; if he attempts a risky snipe, don\u2019t take a blind head-on \u2014 bait him into a collision or trap him against walls.\n- Prioritize controlling the 6\u20137 x-range and forcing him toward the left/top walls while keeping room to dodge.\n\nLET\u2019S BOX HIM IN \u2014 press the attack and don\u2019t give him breathing room.

If we go UP and he stays, we collide head-on and BOTH DIE! \ud83d\ude35 If he moves away, it's safe. But that's a gamble.  \n- **DOWN** to (6,6): Safe (empty, on board).  \n- **LEFT** to (5,7): Safe (empty, on board).  \n- **RIGHT** to (7,7): Safe (empty, on board).  \n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nHe's at (6,8). Where can he go?  \n- UP to (6,9): top edge, possible but limiting.  \n- DOWN to (6,7): OUR CURRENT CELL! If he goes DOWN and we stay, he crashes into us and DIES!

He might go DOWN thinking we'll stay, and then he dies. But he might predict that.  \nIf we move LEFT to (5,7), we're also safe from his DOWN.  \nBut what if we STAY AGGRESSIVE and try to force him into a corner?  \n\n**SAFEST + AGGRESSIVE MOVE:**  \nRIGHT to (7,7) feels strong. It:  \n1) Avoids immediate head-on risk (unless he goes RIGHT too, which is unlikely if he wants the apple at (7,6)?).  \n2) Puts us closer to apples (7,6) and (7,5) for future content! \ud83c\udf4e  \n3) Keeps all options open next turn\u2014we can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT from there.  \n4) Starts boxing him from the right side if he stays up top.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nWe want to push him toward the top wall. Next turn, if he's at (6,7) or (5,8), we can move to cut off his escape. Grow by taking apples when safe, but PRIORITY is trapping him. If scores stay tied, avoid head-on. If we get longer, force the collision!  \n\nRIGHT",

No bodies, tied 0\u20130.\n- We're directly above him. We can either keep pressure, swipe lateral control, or back off. We do NOT want a mutual head-on since scores are tied.\n\nMove-by-move thinking:\n- UP \u2192 (6,9): safe but hugs the top wall and reduces vertical escape. Less room to maneuver \u2014 not ideal for trapping.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,7): moves into his current head cell. Simultaneous move mechanics: swapping or following is allowed, so this is safe unless we both move into the same third cell (unlikely this turn). DOWN keeps the most options (left/right/down/up from new pos) and keeps direct pressure on him. Aggro move without dumb suicide.\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,8): safe, aggressive flank \u2014 good for boxing later but gives him room to slip down or right.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,8): safe, drifts away from him and gives him initiative. Not what we want.\n\nEliminate losers: UP and RIGHT are either passive or limit escape. LEFT is decent but gives him a simple sidestep. DOWN is the most confrontational while keeping 3\u20134 follow-up options and forcing him to react right now.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns \u2014 memorize this as our playbook): keep pressure directly above/behind him. If he retreats/down-left/right, follow and compress his available cells \u2014 always keep at least two escape routes for ourselves. If he tries a risky head-swap, we can bait and keep our body clear to survive. If he panics toward the wall, close the gap and force a mistake. \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4a\n\nWe\u2019re going in on him \u2014 time to squeeze. DOWN",
