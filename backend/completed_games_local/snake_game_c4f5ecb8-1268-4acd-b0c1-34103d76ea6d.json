Wait:  \nCurrent body: head (8,0), body (7,0). After move RIGHT to (9,0), new head (9,0), body becomes [(8,0)] (tail at (8,0)).  \n\nSo next turn from (9,0), body at (8,0).  \nThen UP to (9,1) possible if enemy not there; LEFT to (8,0) is body \u2192 dead; DOWN off-board; RIGHT off-board. So only UP might be safe if enemy not at (9,1). That\u2019s risky if enemy stays there.  \n\nFrom (8,1) after UP:  \nNext turn body at (8,0). Possible moves: UP (8,2), LEFT (7,1), RIGHT (9,1) (if enemy not there), DOWN (8,0) body \u2192 dead. More options.  \n\nBut UP risks collision this turn if enemy goes LEFT.  \n\n---\n\nGiven the enemy\u2019s likely move (LEFT), RIGHT avoids that collision.  \nEven though RIGHT reduces future options next turn, survival this turn is priority.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go RIGHT now, next turn I\u2019ll be at (9,0) with body at (8,0).  \nEnemy likely at (8,1) if they go LEFT.  \nThen my only safe move next turn may be UP if enemy moves away from (9,1), else I could be trapped.  \nBut I can reassess then\u2014maybe enemy goes elsewhere.  \n\nFor now, choose RIGHT to avoid probable head-on collision.  \n\nRIGHT",

LEFT (8,1) is on board and unoccupied. RIGHT (10,1) is off-board. Safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Head-on collision risk**  \nEnemy head at (9,3) can move UP to (9,4), DOWN to (9,2), or LEFT to (8,3). If I go UP to (9,2) and enemy goes DOWN to (9,2), we collide and both die. If I go LEFT to (8,1), no enemy move can reach (8,1) this turn, so LEFT avoids collision entirely.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Enemy likely move**  \nClosest apple to enemy is (5,5) (distance 6). UP and LEFT both reduce that distance to 5. LEFT also reduces distance to (4,1) (from 7 to 6), while UP increases it. Enemy may prefer LEFT for dual benefit. Even if enemy chooses DOWN, my LEFT remains safe.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future options**  \nIf I go LEFT to (8,1), my body becomes [(9,1)]. Next turn from (8,1), I\u2019ll have three safe moves: UP (8,2), DOWN (8,0), LEFT (7,1). If I go UP to (9,2), my body becomes [(9,1)], leaving only UP (9,3) and LEFT (8,2) as safe next moves.

Distance to (5,5) decreases equally (from 8 to 7) for both moves. LEFT is better for apple collection.\n\n**Conclusion:** LEFT is safer (no collision risk), provides more future options, and moves me closer to the nearest apple.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Continue moving left toward apple (4,1). From (8,1), consider LEFT to (7,1) or DOWN to (8,0) depending on enemy\u2019s new position. Keep an eye on enemy #1, who may descend from above.\n\nLEFT",

From (8,3):  \n- DOWN (8,2) reduces distance to (5,5) to 5.  \n- LEFT (7,3) reduces distance to (5,5) to 5 and also reduces distance to (4,1) from 8 to 7.  \n- UP (8,4) increases distance to (5,5).  \nEnemy may prefer DOWN or LEFT. If enemy goes DOWN to (8,2), my UP would collide.  \nSafer to avoid UP.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future options after each safe move**  \nFrom (8,1):  \n- DOWN to (8,0): next turn safe moves likely UP (8,1) (occupied by my tail?), LEFT (7,0), RIGHT (9,0). Tail at (9,1) moves away, so (8,1) becomes free. That gives 3 options.  \n- LEFT to (7,1): next turn safe moves UP (7,2), DOWN (7,0), LEFT (6,1). Possibly 3 options.  \nBoth seem fine.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nNearest apple to me: (4,1) distance |8-4|+|1-1| = 4.  \n- DOWN to (8,0): distance to (4,1) becomes 5 \u2192 worse.  \n- LEFT to (7,1): distance becomes 3 \u2192 better.  \nAlso apple at (0,0) is far, apple at (5,5) distance 9 vs 10 for DOWN. LEFT improves apple proximity.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid trapping myself**  \nLEFT keeps me near middle columns, more room. DOWN puts me near bottom edge, slightly limits future upward movement but not immediately dangerous.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nUP risks collision, DOWN moves away from nearest apple, LEFT is safe, reduces distance to apple (4,1), and maintains good future options.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Continue moving left toward apple (4,1). From (7,1), consider LEFT to (6,1) or DOWN to (7,0) to approach apple while staying safe from enemy #1. Monitor enemy\u2019s movement toward (5,5) or (4,1).\n\nLEFT",

Moving LEFT to (5,1) keeps me away from enemy path to (5,5) for now.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nNext turn from (5,1): apple at (4,1) is adjacent LEFT. So next turn I can eat it safely if enemy not also moving there. Enemy is far (distance 5 from (4,1)), so likely safe. After eating, I\u2019ll grow to length 3 (head + 2 body segments), giving more space cushion. Then aim for (3,6) or (5,5) depending on safety.  \n\nLEFT is clearly best: closest to nearest apple, safe, good future options.  \n\n**Final decision:**  \nLEFT",

Wait, from (3,5) my body will be at (4,4),(4,3),(5,3) so DOWN (3,4) is empty then? Let\u2019s check: after move UP, body becomes [(3,5),(4,4),(4,3),(5,3)]. So DOWN (3,4) is empty. So UP gives good mobility.  \n- DOWN to (3,3): next turn safe moves likely UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN maybe off board? (3,2) is on board). Also okay mobility but moves away from apples.  \n- LEFT to (2,4): next turn safe moves likely UP, DOWN, LEFT (RIGHT into own body at (3,4)? Wait, after LEFT body is [(2,4),(3,4),(4,4),(4,3)], so RIGHT (3,4) is occupied. So LEFT reduces mobility slightly.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy consideration**  \nEnemy at (5,4) with no body. It will likely go for nearest apple (5,5) UP, or possibly (4,4) LEFT into my old body? That would kill it. Safer for enemy is UP to (5,5) or RIGHT to (6,4). If enemy goes UP to (5,5), it eats apple and grows, then next turn its body will be at (5,4). That could block area near (5,5). Going UP myself to (3,5) then (3,6) gets apple (3,6) without interfering.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP is safe, no head-on risk, moves directly toward apple (3,6) (distance 1 next turn), and maintains good future mobility. DOWN or LEFT avoid apples and don\u2019t improve position. Given my lead (3 apples vs 0), securing another apple safely is good.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,5), if apple (3,6) still there, go UP to eat it. Watch enemy position after its move. After eating (3,6), consider path toward (4,9) or (7,9), keeping distance from enemy. Avoid moving into confined spaces.  \n\nUP",

Yes (y=7).\n   - Occupied by my body? No.\n   - Occupied by enemy body? Enemy has no body yet.\n   - Potential head-on collision? Enemy head at (5,4) could move UP to (5,5) \u2014 not same cell. Could move LEFT to (4,4) \u2014 not same. Could move DOWN to (5,3) \u2014 no. Could move RIGHT to (6,4) \u2014 no. So safe from head-on.\n   - Safe? Yes.\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (3,5)\n   - Inside board? Yes (y=5).\n   - Occupied by my body? Yes, (3,5) is my body segment \u2192 death.\n   - Eliminated.\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (2,6)\n   - Inside board? Yes.\n   - Occupied by my body? No.\n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.\n   - Potential head-on collision? Enemy head at (5,4) could move UP to (5,5) \u2014 no; LEFT to (4,4) \u2014 no; DOWN to (5,3) \u2014 no; RIGHT to (6,4) \u2014 no. So safe.\n   - Safe? Yes.\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,6)\n   - Inside board? Yes.\n   - Occupied by my body? No.\n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.\n   - Potential head-on collision? Enemy could move LEFT from (5,4) to (4,4) \u2014 not same as (4,6). Safe.\n   - Safe? Yes.\n\n---\n\n**Safe moves:** UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Next, consider apple proximity and future options:**\n\n- **UP (3,7):**\n  - Apples nearby: (4,9) is 2 up + 1 right from (3,7), Manhattan distance = 3. (6,8) is 3 right + 1 up, distance = 4. (7,9) further.\n  - Future moves from (3,7): can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN goes back to (3,6), which is safe next turn if body moved? Actually next turn my tail will move from (4,3) to somewhere depending on my move \u2014 but if I go UP, my body segments shift: head to (3,7), (3,6) becomes body, (3,5) becomes body, (3,4) body, (4,4) body, tail (4,3) disappears if no apple eaten. So (3,6) will be occupied by my body next turn, so DOWN from (3,7) would be into own body next turn if I go UP now? Wait, check: after moving UP without eating apple: new body: [(3,7), (3,6), (3,5), (4,4), (4,3)]? No \u2014 my current body: head (3,6), body: (3,5), (3,4), (4,4), (4,3). After moving UP without eating: head (3,7), body becomes [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)] \u2014 tail (4,3) is gone because length stays 5. So (3,6) occupied next turn. So from (3,7), DOWN next turn would be into (3,6) which is my body \u2014 so that\u2019s bad. So UP now reduces future DOWN option next turn. But still have LEFT/RIGHT/UP from (3,7).\n\n- **LEFT (2,6):**\n  - Apples: far from most apples except maybe (0,0) far away.\n  - Future moves from (2,6): can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT? Check my body next turn if I go LEFT without eating apple: head (2,6), body: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)], tail gone. So (3,6) occupied, (2,5) free, (1,6) free, (2,7) free. So all four directions possible except RIGHT goes to (3,6) which is my body \u2192 so RIGHT not possible next turn. So 3 directions possible.\n\n- **RIGHT (4,6):**\n  - Apples: closer to (4,9) and (6,8), (5,5) also close but enemy might target (5,5) this turn.\n  - Future moves from (4,6) without eating apple: head (4,6), body: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (4,4)], tail gone. So (3,6) occupied, (4,5) free?, (4,7) free, (5,6) free. So UP, DOWN, RIGHT possible (LEFT goes to (3,6) occupied). 3 directions.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy\u2019s likely move:** Snake #1 at (5,4), apples: (5,5) is adjacent UP. It will probably go UP to eat apple unless it sees danger. Could it die? From (5,4), UP to (5,5) is safe (no body there, my body far). So likely enemy moves UP to (5,5) this turn.\n\nIf enemy goes UP to (5,5), then apple at (5,5) gone next turn. That means apples left: (0,0), (4,9), (7,9), (6,8).\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,6), I\u2019m closer to (4,9) and (6,8) than from (3,7). Actually from (3,7) to (4,9): up 2, right 1; from (4,6) to (4,9): up 3. Same Manhattan distance? (3,7)\u2192(4,9): dy=2, dx=1 \u2192 3. (4,6)\u2192(4,9): dy=3 \u2192 3. Same distance.\n\nBut going RIGHT also gets me closer to (6,8): from (4,6): dx=2, dy=2 \u2192 4; from (3,7): dx=3, dy=1 \u2192 4. Same.\n\nGoing LEFT moves me away from all apples except (0,0) which is far. So LEFT seems worst for apple gathering.\n\n---\n\n**Avoiding future dead ends:**  \nUP (3,7) loses DOWN option next turn but still okay. RIGHT (4,6) loses LEFT option next turn. Both okay.\n\n**Head-on risk this turn:** Enemy likely UP to (5,5), so no conflict.\n\nI think RIGHT is slightly better than UP because:\n- From (4,6), I can go UP next turn to (4,7) toward (4,9), or RIGHT to (5,6) toward (6,8)/(7,9).\n- From (3,7), going UP to (3,8) then (3,9) then need RIGHT to (4,9) \u2014 longer path.\n\nAlso, enemy at (5,5) after eating apple will grow to length 2 next turn, body at (5,4). That could block some area but not immediately threatening.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move toward (4,9) or (6,8). Keep distance from enemy head. Avoid boxing self in corners. Remember tail will move each turn unless eating apple.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

So their options: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nIf enemy goes UP to (5,6), then my RIGHT to (5,6) causes head-on collision \u2192 both die.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (4,5), then my DOWN to (4,5) causes head-on collision \u2192 both die.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (6,5), then both my DOWN and RIGHT are safe from head-on.  \n\nSo I should avoid moves that could collide if enemy chooses a certain likely move.  \n\nWhich move is safest?  \n- UP to (4,7): enemy can\u2019t reach (4,7) in one move from (5,5) \u2192 safe from head-on regardless of enemy move.  \n- DOWN to (4,5): only collides if enemy moves LEFT.  \n- RIGHT to (5,6): only collides if enemy moves UP.  \n\nEnemy\u2019s incentives:  \nApples: (4,9) is close \u2014 from (5,5), LEFT to (4,5) then UP, or UP to (5,6) then LEFT? Actually from (5,5) to (4,9): Manhattan distance 5. From (4,5) to (4,9): distance 4. From (5,6) to (4,9): distance 4 as well (dx=-1, dy=3). So both LEFT and UP put enemy equally closer to (4,9) in two moves.  \n\nBut enemy also sees (6,8) from (5,5): distance 3 (dx=1, dy=3). From (5,6): distance 3 (dx=1, dy=2) \u2014 actually shorter. So UP then RIGHT might be better for (6,8).  \n\nGiven enemy\u2019s body is at (5,4), moving UP to (5,6) leaves body behind safely. Moving LEFT to (4,5) also safe. I\u2019d guess enemy might go UP because (6,8) is closer in Manhattan than (4,9) from (5,6)? Let\u2019s check: (5,6) to (6,8): dx=1, dy=2 \u2192 3. (5,6) to (4,9): dx=-1, dy=3 \u2192 4. So (6,8) is closer. So UP is reasonable for enemy.  \n\nIf enemy goes UP, my RIGHT is deadly. My DOWN is safe if enemy goes UP. But DOWN from (4,6) to (4,5) puts me closer to apple (7,0)? Not really.  \n\nUP seems safest because no head-on possible.  \n\n---\n\n**Future options:**  \nFrom (4,7) without eating apple: body becomes [(4,6),(3,6),(3,5),(3,4)], tail (4,4) gone. So next turn, (4,6) is my body, so from (4,7), DOWN is blocked. But UP, LEFT, RIGHT open.  \n\nApple proximity: (4,9) is 2 up from (4,7) \u2014 close. (6,8) is 2 right, 1 up from (4,7) \u2014 close. Good position to target either.  \n\nFrom (4,5) (if I choose DOWN and enemy doesn\u2019t kill me): body becomes [(4,6),(3,6),(3,5),(3,4)], so (4,6) occupied, (4,4) free? Actually (4,4) was tail, now gone. So from (4,5), UP blocked by my body at (4,6), DOWN to (4,4) free, LEFT to (3,5) occupied (my body), RIGHT to (5,5) possible unless enemy there. So fewer options.  \n\nFrom (5,6) (if I choose RIGHT and enemy doesn\u2019t kill me): body becomes [(4,6),(3,6),(3,5),(3,4)], so (4,6) occupied, (5,5) possibly enemy, (5,7) free, (6,6) free. Options limited but okay.  \n\nBut UP is safest this turn and keeps good apple access.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (4,7), consider moving toward (4,9) or (6,8) depending on enemy position. Avoid moving into (5,6) if enemy might be there.  \n\nUP",

Yes (0\u20139).  \n   - My body? No.  \n   - Enemy body? No.  \n   - Head-on collision risk? Enemy head at (5,6) could move UP\u2192(5,7), LEFT\u2192(4,6), DOWN\u2192(5,5), RIGHT\u2192(6,6). None is (4,8). Safe.\n\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (4, 6)**  \n   - Inside board? Yes.  \n   - My body? Yes, (4,6) is my body \u2192 suicide.\n\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (3, 7)**  \n   - Inside board? Yes.  \n   - My body? No.  \n   - Enemy body? No.  \n   - Head-on risk? Enemy moving RIGHT from (5,6) to (6,6) no. Enemy moving UP to (5,7) no. Enemy moving DOWN to (5,5) no. Enemy moving LEFT to (4,6) no. Safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (5, 7)**  \n   - Inside board? Yes.  \n   - My body? No.  \n   - Enemy body? No.  \n   - Head-on risk? Enemy moving LEFT from (5,6) to (4,6) no. Enemy moving UP to (5,7) \u2192 yes, possible. If enemy chooses UP, we collide at (5,7) \u2192 both die.\n\n---\n\n**Immediately safe moves:** UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is suicide).  \nRIGHT has potential head-on collision if enemy goes UP.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy\u2019s possible moves from (5,6):**\n- UP \u2192 (5,7)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,5) (own body at (5,5)? Yes, enemy body is [(5,5)] \u2192 DOWN would be suicide, so enemy won\u2019t choose DOWN).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,6)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,6)  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s viable moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nIf enemy goes UP to (5,7) and I go RIGHT to (5,7), head-on collision \u2192 both die.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (4,6) and I go LEFT to (3,7), no collision.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (6,6) and I go RIGHT to (5,7), no collision.  \n\nSo RIGHT is risky only if enemy chooses UP.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy\u2019s incentives:**  \nApples: closest are (4,9) and (6,8).  \nFrom (5,6):  \n- To (4,9): dx=-1, dy=3 \u2192 Manhattan 4.  \n- To (6,8): dx=1, dy=2 \u2192 Manhattan 3. So (6,8) is slightly closer.  \n\nEnemy might go RIGHT to (6,6) to get closer to (6,8), or UP to (5,7) to get closer to both (4,9) and (6,8). LEFT to (4,6) moves away from (6,8) but toward (4,9).  \n\nGiven (6,8) is closest, enemy might prefer UP or RIGHT. If enemy goes UP, my RIGHT is deadly.  \n\n---\n\n**Which move is safest?**  \nUP to (4,8): no head-on possible regardless of enemy\u2019s move.  \nLEFT to (3,7): safe from head-on (enemy can\u2019t reach it in one move).  \nRIGHT to (5,7): possible head-on if enemy goes UP.  \n\nUP and LEFT are collision-safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Future options after each safe move:**\n\n- **UP to (4,8):** body becomes [(4,7),(4,6),(3,6),(3,5),(3,4)], tail (3,4) gone. Next turn from (4,8): UP to (4,9) apple? Yes, apple at (4,9) \u2192 can eat next turn. DOWN to (4,7) blocked by my body. LEFT to (3,8) free. RIGHT to (5,8) free. So options: UP (apple), LEFT, RIGHT. Good.  \n\n- **LEFT to (3,7):** body becomes [(4,7),(4,6),(3,6),(3,5),(3,4)], tail (3,4) gone. Next turn from (3,7): UP to (3,8) free, DOWN to (3,6) blocked (my body), LEFT to (2,7) free, RIGHT to (4,7) blocked. Options: UP, LEFT. Fewer options, but still viable.  \n\nUP gives more options next turn and puts me one step from apple (4,9).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn if I go UP:**  \nIf enemy is not threatening (5,9) or (4,9), I can eat (4,9) next turn. If enemy is close, maybe go LEFT or RIGHT to avoid collision. But eating apple grows me, which is good.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nUP is safest this turn, avoids head-on risk, and positions me to get apple (4,9) next turn if safe.  \n\nUP",
