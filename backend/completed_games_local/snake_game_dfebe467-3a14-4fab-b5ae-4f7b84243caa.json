This is an apple (A). Safe.\n   * DOWN: (6, 5). Empty space. Safe.\n   * LEFT: (5, 6). Empty space. Safe.\n   * RIGHT: (7, 6). Empty space. Safe.\n\n   Since my snake is only one segment long, moving into adjacent empty cells or apples is safe unless the enemy moves there simultaneously (head-on collision risk).\n\n3. **Analyze risk/reward for immediate moves:**\n\n   * **UP to (6, 7):** This is an apple. Excellent immediate reward.\n     * Risk of collision: Enemy snake #0 is far away at (1, 5). They cannot reach (6, 7) this turn. Safe.\n\n   * **DOWN to (6, 5):** Empty space. Moves slightly away from most nearby apples, but keeps central position.\n   * **LEFT to (5, 6):** Empty space.\n   * **RIGHT to (7, 6):** Empty space.\n\n4. **Strategic choice:**\n   Moving UP to (6, 7) immediately grants an apple and increases body length, which is a strong start. Given the enemy is far away, the move is perfectly safe.\n\n**Plan:** Move UP to secure the apple at (6, 7).\n\nUP",

Enemy head at (6,6) is far and cannot reach any of these squares this turn, so head-on collision risk this turn is negligible.\n- Which move keeps options open? RIGHT to (2,5) moves directly toward the nearby apple at (3,5) and leaves multiple follow-up choices (continue RIGHT to eat apple, or go UP to approach (2,6), or DOWN toward other apples). UP to (1,6) also approaches (2,6) but is slightly less direct toward the immediate apple cluster. LEFT and DOWN move away from nearby apples and reduce momentum toward a cluster.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns:\n- Move to (2,5) this turn, then go to (3,5) to eat that apple. After eating, prefer moves that keep space (avoid cornering) and pursue nearby apples (e.g., (2,6), (5,3), (2,3)) while watching enemy head for potential conflicts. If the enemy moves toward the apple cluster around x\u22486\u20139, avoid confronting them head-on and favor securing local apples safely.\n\nDecision:\nRIGHT",

The apple (4, 8) is the easiest immediate target.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (Snake 0 at (3, 5)):**\nEnemy 0 is likely moving towards nearby apples: (2, 6) [2 moves], (5, 3) [4 moves], (3, 0) [5 moves].\nIf Enemy 0 moves UP to (3, 6) or LEFT to (2, 5) (suicide, or if tail moved), or RIGHT to (4, 5).\nIf they move UP to (3, 6), they are heading towards (2, 6).\nMy move LEFT to (5, 8) keeps me safely distant from the enemy and its potential path.\n\nThe choice is LEFT.\n\n**Future Plan:** After eating (4, 8) on Turn 3, I will be at the left side of the upper board. I should then look for (2, 6) or down towards (2, 3) or (1, 2) depending on what Snake 0 does.\n\nLEFT",

This seems like a reasonable way to approach the central band of apples.\n\n*   **LEFT to (3, 8):** Empty space.\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Reward:* No immediate apples. Does not directly lead to the closest apples, but positions me for a turn towards the western wall.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 8):** My body segment.\n    *   *Safety:* Deadly. **KILL MOVE.**\n\n**3. Head-to-Head Collision Check (Neighboring Cells Only):**\nEnemy 0 is at (2, 6). It can move to (1, 6), (3, 6) (body), (2, 7), or (2, 5).\nMy head is at (4, 8).\n\nPossible collision points (if E0 moves towards me): None. The closest E0 can get is (3, 7) or (3, 5).\n\n**4. Decision Rationale:**\n\nI have a strong position high up on the board. The two main directions are UP towards (9, 9) (high value target) or DOWN/LEFT towards the cluster of apples around the middle (2, 5), (5, 3).\n\n*   **Option 1: UP to (4, 9).**\n    *   Pro: Guarantees safety, sets up a run for the corner apple (9, 9).\n    *   Con: Doesn't address the lower-lying cluster of 5-move distant apples right away.\n\n*   **Option 2: DOWN to (4, 7).**\n    *   Pro: Puts me in a direct path to (2, 5) (4 moves) or (5, 3) (5 moves). These are the closest apples.\n    *   Con: Brings me closer to Enemy 0 (2, 6) who is currently low. If Enemy 0 moves to (2, 7) or (3, 7), they are moving up the board, but they are unlikely to reach (4, 7) in time to block me, especially if they are distracted by (2, 5) or (0, 3).\n\n*   **Option 3: LEFT to (3, 8).**\n    *   Pro: Maintains safety; good position to move down the left wall towards (0, 3) or (0, 1).\n    *   Con: (3, 8) is 1 move farther away from the target (2, 5) than (4, 7).\n\nSince (2, 5) and (5, 3) are the closest targets, moving DOWN to (4, 7) seems optimal for setting up the next moves while maintaining flexibility. I will then likely move LEFT/DOWN to intercept (2, 5), or RIGHT/DOWN for (5, 3).\n\nLet's anticipate Enemy 0's move from (2, 6).\nE0's closest apples: (2, 5) (1 move), (0, 3) (5 moves), (2, 3) (3 moves).\nE0 will almost certainly move DOWN to (2, 5) to eat the apple.\n\nIf E0 takes (2, 5), the next closest apples for me are:\n1. (5, 3): |4-5| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 moves (from (4, 7)).\n2. (9, 9): |4-9| + |7-9| = 5 + 2 = 7 moves (from (4, 7)).\n3. (2, 3): |4-2| + |7-3| = 2 + 4 = 6 moves (from (4, 7)).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 7), I am well-positioned to pivot into the central region for (5, 3).\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 9), I immediately target the perimeter:\n1. (9, 9): |4-9| + |9-9| = 5 moves (from (4, 9)).\n2. (8, 6): |4-8| + |9-6| = 4 + 3 = 7 moves (from (4, 9)).\n\nGiven that E0 has a clear 1-move priority (2, 5), I should prioritize the next set of apples that E0 is unlikely to intercept quickly. (5, 3) is further from E0's current position and direction than (2, 3). Moving DOWN targets (5, 3) nicely.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Turn 5):**\nMy head will be at (4, 7). Enemy 0 likely moves to (2, 5) and grows. I will aim for the lower-right cluster: (5, 3), (7, 5), (8, 5). I should move RIGHT or DOWN next turn to continue advancing towards (5, 3).\n\nDOWN",

No enemy head is close enough to contest this cell this turn.\n\nRisk/benefit:\n- Taking the apple at (2,5) gives an immediate score increase and is not contested by the nearby enemy (enemy head at (4,8)). After eating, my body will grow (tail will not move), so I must avoid moving into (3,5) or back into (2,6) on the next turn (those will be occupied).\n- UP or LEFT keep more immediate freedom but miss an easy apple. RIGHT is deadly.\n\nShort plan for the next few turns:\n- Eat (2,5) now, then prioritize nearby low-contest apples (e.g., (2,3), (1,2), (0,3), (0,1)).\n- After eating, avoid moving into occupied segments (especially (3,5) and (2,6)). Favor moving down/left to approach the cluster around x<=2.\n- Avoid the right side (x>=5\u20139) where the enemy is closer and apples are clustered.\n\nDOWN",

This is the closest target.\n*   **LEFT to (3, 7):** Empty space.\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Closest neighbor is E0 body (3, 6).\n    *   *Reward:* Puts me in striking distance of (2, 3).

Distance to (5, 3) is |5-5| + |7-3| = 0 + 4 = 4 moves. Also good for apples further right ((7, 5), (8, 5)).\n\n**3.

Decision Rationale:**\n\nMy last move brought me to (4, 7). Enemy 0 has successfully eaten (2, 5). My two best-positioned apples are (5, 3) (4 moves away via RIGHT or DOWN) and (2, 3) (5 moves away via LEFT).\n\n*   **Option 1: RIGHT to (5, 7).**\n    *   Pros: Keeps 4 moves distance to (5, 3). Positions me for a clean path down the 5-column (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3). Also prepares for the right side apples like (7, 5) and (8, 5).\n    *   Cons: Pulls me further away from the left wall section where E0 is currently operating.\n\n*   **Option 2: DOWN to (4, 6).**\n    *   Pros: Keeps 4 moves distance to (5, 3). Centralizes me. Prepares for a diagonal down-right movement.\n    *   Cons: The path down column 4 is less direct to (5, 3) than descending column 5.\n\n*   **Option 3: LEFT to (3, 7).**\n    *   Pros: Positions me to challenge E0 for the (2, 3) apple.\n    *   Cons: (2, 3) is 5 moves away. If E0 moves to (2, 4), they are 1 move closer to (2, 3) than I am (4 moves for E0). E0's current direction (consuming (2, 5)) suggests they are focused on the lower-left quadrant. Rushing (2, 3) might lead to a blockage or a race I am likely to lose.\n\n**Choosing the best target:** (5, 3). It is the closest high-value apple not immediately contested by Snake 0.\n\nMoving **RIGHT** to (5, 7) sets up the best run to (5, 3). The next moves would likely be DOWN (to 5, 6), DOWN (to 5, 5), DOWN (to 5, 4), and then DOWN to eat (5, 3). This is a safe, direct path.\n\n*Anticipating E0's move from (2, 5):* E0 will likely move DOWN to (2, 4) or LEFT to (1, 5) to clear their body and head towards (2, 3), (1, 2) or (0, 3). If they go (2, 4) then (2, 3) is 2 moves away. If I delay, E0 will get (2, 3), and my next closest apple is further away than (5, 3). I should secure (5, 3) quickly.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Turn 6):**\nMove RIGHT to (5, 7). Next move: DOWN to (5, 6), continuing the direct path to (5, 3). Maintain pressure on the center-right section of the board.\n\nRIGHT",

It is 4 moves away via a direct path.\n\n**1. Evaluate Potential Moves from Head (5, 7):**\n\n*   **UP to (5, 8):** Into my body segment. Deadly.\n*   **DOWN to (5, 6):** Empty space.\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Directly towards the target (5, 3).\n    *   *Reward:* Moves 1 step closer to (5, 3). Distance remaining: 3.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 7):** Into my body segment (position immediately behind head). Deadly.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 7):** Empty space.\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Reward:* Maintains distance 4 to (5, 3) (via 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 5, 3 is 1 + 2 = 3 moves + 1 movement left= 4 moves to (5,3)). Also opens up route to (7, 5) (Distance 4: |6-7| + |7-5| = 1 + 2 = 3 moves).\n\n**2. Evaluate Enemy Threat (Snake 0 at (2, 4)):**\n\nSnake 0 is heavily focused on the bottom left quadrant, likely targeting (2, 3), (1, 2), or (0, 3).\n\nSnake 0 safe moves:\n*   (2, 3) (Apple): Distance 1. Very likely move.\n*   (1, 4) (Empty): Distance 1 to (1, 2).\n*   (3, 4) (Empty)\n*   (2, 5) (Body - safe for S0 if tail (3, 6) moves)\n\nIf Snake 0 moves to (2, 3) (the apple), they will grow. This is the most anticipated move. This move puts S0 4 units away from me (|5-2| + |7-3| = 3 + 4 = 7).\n\n**3. Choose Best Move:**\n\nSince moving UP or LEFT is fatal, the choice is between DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n*   **DOWN to (5, 6):** Secures the direct, fastest path to the target (5, 3). Successive moves would be (5, 5), (5, 4), and then eating (5, 3). This seems optimal for safe apple acquisition.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 7):** Opens up the right side (7, 5), (8, 5) but delays getting (5, 3). While (7, 5) is also 3 moves away from (6, 7), (5, 3) is a more centrally located apple, valuable for maintaining control.\n\nGiven the priority is securing the closest, safest apple, **DOWN** to (5, 6) is the mandatory choice. It continues the strategy initiated last turn.\n\n**4. Collision Check:**\nThere is no risk of collision as Snake 0 is far away and moving away towards the left side of the board.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Turn 7):**\nTarget (5, 3). Move DOWN to (5, 6), positioning for the next steps: (5, 5) and (5, 4) before consuming (5, 3). This is a safe route.\n\nDOWN",

The nearest enemy head (5,7) is far and cannot contest (2,3) this turn, so the apple is effectively uncontested.\n- LEFT or RIGHT are safe but pass up a free apple and don't improve my immediate score. They also don't offer a clear advantage over taking the apple now.\n- Moving DOWN keeps options open afterward to continue toward the low-x apple cluster (1,2), (0,3), (0,1) and stays away from the enemy. Growing by one here is fine; it doesn't trap me since I have space to turn after consuming the apple.\n\nShort plan:\n- Take (2,3) now (DOWN).\n- Next moves: head toward (1,2) then sweep (0,3)/(0,1) as available, avoiding the enemy and keeping lateral escape options.\n\nDOWN",

Apples 3.\n    *   *Note:* My last move was DOWN from (5, 7) to (5, 6). The new tail segment (the old head at (5, 7)) remains, the old tail (4, 8) disappears since I didn't eat an apple. *Correction based on provided state*: Since the apple count is 3 and the length is 4, my previous move DOWN did *not* eat an apple. The tail (4, 8) must have disappeared, so the body segments are now (5, 7), (4, 7), and (4, 8) is the body segment right before the tail (which is what is listed for Turn 7). Wait, the input body listed for my snake now is: `[(5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8)]`. This means my full length is 4. If I moved from (5, 7) to (5, 6) (DOWN) without eating, the snake should be: Head (5, 6), Body [(5, 7), (4, 7)]. The segment (4, 8) should have been the old tail segment that disappeared.\n    *   *Re-interpreting provided data:* The provided state *always* shows the current full body excluding the head, ordered head-to-tail.\n        *   Turn 6 Head: (5, 7). Body: [(4, 7), (4, 8)]\n        *   Turn 7 Head: (5, 6). Body: [(5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8)]\n        *   Aha! I must have eaten an apple on Turn 6! Let's check the score.\n            *   Turn 6 Score: 3 apples. Length 4 (Head (5, 7), Body [(5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8)] assuming the body list was wrong/misread from Turn 5 analysis, OR length was 3, and I ate one, making it length 4.\n            *   *Scenario 1: Snake was length 4 before Turn 6, apple count was 2.* If I ate an apple, my score is 3 and length is 5.\n            *   *Scenario 2: Snake was length 3 before Turn 6, apple count was 3.* If I moved to (5, 6) (empty), my length should be 3.\n            *   *Analyzing the data provided for Turn 7:* Head (5, 6). Body [(5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8)]. Length 4. Apples 3. If I moved DOWN from (5, 7) to (5, 6), and my length remained 4, the tail must have effectively stayed in place, meaning I collected an apple.\n            *   *Conclusion:* I must have eaten an apple on Turn 6, increasing my apple count to 3 and retaining the old tail position (4, 8). The previous state must have misstated the coordinates or my interpretation of the length was off, but I'll trust the current state: I am at (5, 6) and I am 4 blocks long.\n*   **Target Apple:** (5, 3). Distance from (5, 6) is 3 moves (directly DOWN).\n*   **Enemy Snake 0:** Head at (2, 3). Length 5 (Body: [(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6)]). Apples 4.\n    *   *Note:* Snake 0 previously had Head (2, 4) and 3 apples. Since it is now at (2, 3) and has 4 apples, it successfully ate the apple at (2, 3) last turn. Its length increased to 5.\n\n*   **Available Apples (14 total):** (9, 9), (9, 1), (5, 3), (1, 2), (8, 5), (8, 6), (3, 0), (8, 0), (0, 1), (9, 2), (5, 1), (7, 5), (0, 3), (2, 0), (8, 8).

Evaluate Potential Moves from Head (5, 6):**\n\n*   **UP to (5, 7):** Into my body segment. Deadly.\n*   **DOWN to (5, 5):** Empty space.\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Directly towards the target (5, 3).\n    *   *Reward:* Moves 1 step closer to (5, 3). Distance remaining: 2.\n    *   *Path check:* (5, 6) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 4) -> (5, 3) (Eat). This is a guaranteed safe line of movement.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 6):** Empty space.\n    *   *Safety:* Safe. Moves towards my body segment (4, 7) but doesn't hit it.\n    *   *Reward:* Maintains distance 3 to (5, 3). Also potentially opens up access to apples (0, 3) and (1, 2) but is a detour.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 6):** Empty space.\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Reward:* Maintains distance 3 to (5, 3). Moves closer to (7, 5) (Distance 2).\n\n**2. Evaluate Enemy Threat (Snake 0 at (2, 3)):**\n\nSnake 0 is long (length 5) and has just moved into the bottom left quadrant.\nSnake 0 safe moves:\n*   (2, 2) (Empty)\n*   (1, 3) (Empty)\n*   (3, 3) (Empty)\n*   (2, 4) (Into body segment; only safe if tail (3, 6) moves).\n\nSnake 0 is likely aiming for (1, 2), (0, 3), or (2, 0). (1, 2) is 2 moves away via (1, 3), then (1, 2). (0, 3) is 2 moves away via (1, 3), then (0, 3). (2, 0) is 3 moves away.\n\nSnake 0 is far from me (distance |5-2| + |6-3| = 3 + 3 = 6). No collision risk.\n\n**3. Choose Best Move:**\n\nMy primary goal remains securing (5, 3). The move **DOWN** to (5, 5) is the most direct and safest path.\n\n*   Move 1 (Turn 7): (5, 6) -> (5, 5)\n*   Move 2 (Turn 8): (5, 5) -> (5, 4)\n*   Move 3 (Turn 9): (5, 4) -> (5, 3) (Eat Apple)\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 6), I could target (7, 5) next. (7, 5) is only 2 moves away.\n*   Move 1 (Turn 7): (5, 6) -> (6, 6)\n*   Move 2 (Turn 8): (6, 6) -> (7, 6) or (6, 5)\n*   Move 3 (Turn 9): (6, 5) -> (7, 5) (Eat Apple) OR (7, 6) -> (7, 5) (2 moves).\n\nBoth (5, 3) and (7, 5) are highly accessible apples (3 moves away). (5, 3) is strategically better as it is central. I will prioritize the planned path to (5, 3).\n\n**4. Collision Check:** Safe.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Turns 8 & 9):**\nContinue the direct descent to apple (5, 3).\nTurn 8: Move DOWN to (5, 4).\nTurn 9: Move DOWN to (5, 3) (Eat apple). After eating (5, 3), the next targets will be (5, 1) or perhaps swinging R/UP to (7, 5).\n\nDOWN",

Evaluate Enemy Threat (Snake 0 at (1, 3)):**\n\nSnake 0 is long (length 5) and is now positioned to attack the apples in the bottom left corner: (0, 3), (1, 2), (0, 1), (2, 0).\nSnake 0 probable moves:\n*   (0, 3) (LEFT - Eat Apple)\n*   (1, 2) (DOWN - Towards Apple)\n*   (2, 3) (UP - Into body segment, deadly unless the tail moves out, but (2, 3) is the immediate segment.)\n\nGiven the proximity of (0, 3) and (1, 2), Snake 0 is likely aiming to eat on this turn if possible. (0, 3) is an obvious target (1 move).\nIf Snake 0 moves to (0, 3), it eats an apple and grows to length 6.\n\nSnake 0 is safely far from me (distance 6). No collision risk.\n\n**3. Choose Best Move:**\n\nMy goal is to eat the apple at (5, 3). Moving DOWN to (5, 4) sets me up perfectly for eating it on Turn 9.\n\nIf I chose RIGHT to (6, 5), I'd be aiming for (7, 5) (2 moves away). This is also a good option, but (5, 3) was prioritized earlier and is perfectly set up. Sticking to the plan is best here.\n\n**4. Collision Check:**\n*   Move (5, 5) -> (5, 4). This cell is empty and safe from immediate collision with my body or board edges.\n*   Enemy Head: (1, 3). Maximum reach is (2, 4), which is distance 3 from (5, 4). Safe.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Turns 9 & 10):**\nTurn 9: Move DOWN to (5, 3) (Eat Apple). Length 5.\nTurn 10: After eating (5, 3), assess whether to target (5, 1) (2 moves away) or swing RIGHT toward (7, 5) (3 moves away). (5, 1) is likely the safest and fastest sequence.\n\nDOWN",

LEFT (to 0,3) gets an apple but puts me on the left edge, reducing escape options (can't go further left), and makes the next move more constrained.\n- DOWN (to 1,2) also gets an apple and keeps me off the edge, preserving more follow-up options (can go toward 0,2/0,1 or sweep back toward center). Enemy head (5,5) is too far to contest these apples this turn, and its backward move into (5,6) is illegal so head-on risk is negligible.\n- UP is safe but passes up an immediate apple and gives the enemy more time to approach the central apples \u2014 not necessary.\n\nShort plan:\n- Take the nearby apple at (1,2) now, then sweep the small-x cluster (0,1),(0,3),(1,2) while staying off the edge when possible.

Length 6 (Body: [(1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)]). Apples 5.\n    *   The enemy head moved from (1, 3) to (1, 2). Since the enemy length is now 6 (up from 5), it must have eaten an apple. The apple at (1, 2) is not listed, so it must have moved from a spot adjacent to one of the eaten apples. Looking at the previous board state, the apple at (0, 3) was available. If the enemy moved LEFT to (0, 3), it would have gotten an apple. If it moved DOWN to (1, 2), it did not immediately get an apple based on the T8 board state (1, 2) was empty.\n    *   Wait, let's re-examine the T8 state and the apple list.\n        *   T8 Apples: (9, 9), (9, 1), (5, 3), (8, 5), (8, 6), (3, 0), (8, 0), (0, 1), (9, 2), (5, 1), (7, 5), (0, 3), (2, 0), (8, 8), (0, 7).\n        *   T8 Enemy Head: (1, 3).\n        *   T9 Enemy Head: (1, 2).

Did the snake move (1, 3) -> (0, 3) (LEFT), eat the apple, and then the head state was misreported in the transition? No, the T9 head is (1, 2).\n        *   If the snake 0 head changed from (1, 3) to (1, 2), and it grew, an apple *must* have been at (1, 2) on T8. Let's check the T8 apple list again: (1, 2) is NOT listed.\n        *   This suggests an error in my analysis or the provided state history. However, I must rely solely on the *current* state (T9) provided.\n        *   Current state: Snake 0 is at (1, 2), length 6, 5 apples collected. It is long and dominant in score.\n*   **Target Apple:** (5, 3). Distance from (5, 4) is 1 move (DOWN).

Moves away from the apple (5, 3).\n\n**2. Evaluate Enemy Threat (Snake 0 at (1, 2)):**\n\nSnake 0 is far away (min distance 4: 1,2 -> 2,2 -> 3,2 -> 4,2 -> 5,2). No immediate risk of collision with my head or body.\n\nSnake 0 is long (L=6) and is positioned near (0, 3), (0, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0).\nThe apple at (0, 3) is still reported on the current board! (This confirms my previous assumption about Snake 0's move was likely wrong, and it simply moved into empty space (1, 2) and if it grew, it must have been an unseen apple outside the visible list, or the length counting is complex). Relying on the current board state: (0, 3) is a prime target for Snake 0 (2 moves: LEFT to (0, 2), then UP to (0, 3), or LEFT to (0, 2), then RIGHT to (1, 2) - wait, (0, 3) is 1 move away if it goes UP/LEFT to get to (0, 2) first, which is 1 move.\nIf Snake 0 moves LEFT to (0, 2), distance to (0, 3) is 1 (UP).\nIf Snake 0 moves UP to (1, 3), it hits its body.\nIf Snake 0 moves DOWN to (1, 1), it is 1 move from A(0, 1).\nIf Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (2, 2), it is free.\n\nSnake 0 seems focused on the bottom left corner apples. I need to focus on my immediate objective.\n\n**3. Choose Best Move:**\n\nThe planned move DOWN to (5, 3) is safe and results in eating an apple. This is the optimal move.\n\n**4. Collision Check:**\nMove (5, 4) -> (5, 3) is safe.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Turns 10 & 11):**\nAfter eating (5, 3), my head will be at (5, 3) (Length 5).\nNearest apples:\nA1: (5, 1) - Distance 2 (DOWN, DOWN). High priority.\nA2: (7, 5) - Distance 3 (RIGHT, UP, UP or RIGHT, RIGHT, UP).\nA3: (8, 5)/(8, 6) - Distance 4-5.\n\nPlan A: Target (5, 1).\nTurn 10: Move DOWN to (5, 2)\nTurn 11: Move DOWN to (5, 1) (Eat Apple).\n\nThis uses the vertical corridor I am already in and secures two central apples in a row.\n\nDOWN",

Apples 5.\n    *   Last move was DOWN to (5, 1), successfully eating an apple.\n*   **Enemy Snake 0:** Head at (1, 1). Length 7 (Body: [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)]). Apples 6.\n    *   Enemy moved from (0, 1) to (1, 1). Since its total length increased (from 6 to 7) and its apple count increased (from 6 to 6 - wait, the score summary shows Enemy apples 6, same as last turn, but the body length increased from 6 to 7. This suggests the apple increase from the previous turn's move was recorded, but in this turn analysis, the enemy body is 7 long. Let's verify the body length change. T11 body was 5 segments + H, total length 6. Now T12 body is 6 segments + H, total length 7. Since the apple count didn't increase this specific turn, the enemy must have moved onto an empty square (1, 1) or the length increase is a consequence of eating an apple on T11. Assuming the body list provided is correct for the current turn (T12), the enemy length is 7).\n\n*   **Apples remaining:** (9, 9), (9, 1), (8, 5), (8, 6), (3, 0), (8, 0), (9, 2), (7, 5), (0, 3), (2, 0), (8, 8), (0, 7), (3, 9), (6, 0), (0, 5). (Total 15 apples left).\n\n*   **My current position:** (5, 1). The snake is long, occupying column 5 from y=1 to y=6.\n*   **Closest reachable apples (Ignoring path blockages for a moment):**\n    1. (6, 0): Distance 2 (RIGHT, DOWN) from (5, 1). High Priority.\n    2. (2, 0): Distance 4 (L, L, D, D) or (D, L, L, D) but (5, 1) -> (5, 0) is blocked by (5, 1) itself if we assume the tail only disappears *after* the move. Wait, the tail is (5, 6). The move happens simultaneously. The cell (5, 6) will clear if I don't eat an apple. I just ate an apple, so my new body segment (5, 6) will remain, and I will gain a new tail segment at (5, 7). No, that's wrong. I ate an apple, so the tail (5, 6) stays, and the body grows. The body list provided updates to reflect the growth.\n    My previous body: [(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)]. 5 segments.\n    New state after eating apple at (5, 1): Head (5, 1). Body: [(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6)]. Length 6. (The body list already includes 5 segments following the head, making total length 6). The tail (5, 6) remains.\n    3.

Highest value movement path.\n\n**2. Evaluate Enemy Threat (Snake 0 at (1, 1)):**\n\nEnemy Snake 0 is at (1, 1). It is 4 steps away from my head. It has the following options:\n*   UP to (1, 2): Into its body segment (1, 2). Deadly.\n*   DOWN to (1, 0): Empty space. Sets up for (2, 0) apple/ (3, 0) apple.\n*   LEFT to (0, 1): Into its body segment (0, 1). Deadly.\n*   RIGHT to (2, 1): Empty space. Sets up for (2, 0) apple/ (3, 0) apple.\n\nThe enemy must move RIGHT to (2, 1) or DOWN to (1, 0) to survive.\nIf it moves to (2, 1), it prepares to contest (2, 0) or move towards the center/right.\nIf it moves to (1, 0), it prepares to contest (2, 0) or (3, 0).\n\nThe distance between my next intended location (6, 1) and potential enemy moves (2, 1) or (1, 0) is safe. No collision risk.\n\n**3. Choose Best Move:**\n\nThe immediate strategic priority is to secure the next closest apple, which is (6, 0). Moving RIGHT to (6, 1) sets me up perfectly for a DOWN move next turn to capture (6, 0).\n\n**4. Long-Term Plan:**\nT12: Move RIGHT to (6, 1). Head at (6, 1).\nT13: Move DOWN to (6, 0). Eat apple. Head at (6, 0). Length 7 (+1 apple).\nFrom (6, 0), options include (8, 0) (Distance 2, R, R), (9, 1) (Distance 3, R, U, U or R, R, U but R, R, U is blocked by (8, 1) if (8, 0) is taken), or circling high to (7, 5).\n\nThis plan maximizes early apple gain in the bottom right quadrant.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, the apple list for T13 showed (2, 0) and (3, 0) were apples. The enemy's move from (2, 1) to (2, 0) suggests they ate the apple at (2, 0). Let's check the current apple list.\n\n*   **Apples remaining:** (9, 9), (9, 1), (8, 5), (8, 6), (3, 0), (8, 0), (9, 2), (7, 5), (0, 3), (8, 8), (0, 7), (3, 9), (0, 5), (3, 3), (9, 7).

Moving UP to (6, 1) is moving into the segment immediately behind the head. **DEADLY.**\n*   **DOWN to (6, -1):** Off the board. Deadly.\n*   **LEFT to (5, 0):** Empty space. Safe. Moves toward (3, 0).\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 0):** Empty space. Safe. Moves toward (8, 0).\n\n**2. Analyze Adjacent Apples:**\n*   (8, 0): Distance 2 (RIGHT, RIGHT).\n*   (3, 0): Distance 3 (LEFT, LEFT, LEFT OR LEFT, UP/DOWN, LEFT/RIGHT).\n\nThe apple at (8, 0) is the highest priority target due to proximity.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake 0's Movement (Head at (2, 0)):**\n\nEnemy 0 must move safely from (2, 0).\n*   UP to (2, 1): Into its own body segment (first segment is (2, 1)). Deadly.\n    *   *Correction on Enemy Snake Anatomy:* Head (2, 0). Body starts at (2, 1). Moving UP to (2, 1) is moving into the segment immediately behind the head. **DEADLY.**\n*   DOWN to (2, -1): Off the board. Deadly.\n*   LEFT to (1, 0): Empty space. Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (3, 0): Apple at (3, 0). High Priority.\n\nThe enemy is highly cornered but has a direct path to the apple at (3, 0). Given their score lead and the easy capture, they are highly likely to move RIGHT to (3, 0).\n\n**4. Collision and Competition Check:**\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 0), the enemy moves RIGHT to (3, 0). No risk of collision. We are targeting completely separate areas.\n\n**5. Optimal Move Determination:**\nMy goal is (8, 0). Moving RIGHT to (7, 0) sets me up perfectly for the next turn to capture (8, 0).\n\n*   T14: Move RIGHT to (7, 0).\n*   T15: Move RIGHT to (8, 0). Eat apple.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 0), I might be contesting the (3, 0) apple, but the enemy is clearly in a better position to get it immediately (1 move vs my 3 moves minimum).\n\nTherefore, focusing on (8, 0) is the better strategy.\n\n**Final Decision:** Move RIGHT.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Strategy (Next 3 turns):**\n1. T14: RIGHT to (7, 0). Set up for (8, 0).\n2. T15: RIGHT to (8, 0). Eat apple. Head at (8, 0). Score 7.\n3. T16: Target (9, 1). Move UP towards (8, 1) or (9, 1).

After moving RIGHT my follow-ups will be RIGHT to (4,0) or UP to (3,1).\n\nEnemy head (6,0) has neck at (6,1), so it cannot move UP; its plausible moves are LEFT (5,0) or RIGHT (7,0). Neither move can reach or contest (3,0) this turn, so there is no immediate head-on risk with my RIGHT move.\n\nChoice and reasoning:\n- LEFT is survivable this turn but gives me fewer safe options and forsakes the nearby apple at (3,0).\n- RIGHT gets the apple immediately, increases my lead, and leaves multiple safe follow-ups (UP or RIGHT). There\u2019s no immediate collision risk with the only opponent.\n\nShort plan:\n- Take the apple at (3,0) now (RIGHT). Then continue along the bottom toward (8,0) if safe, otherwise turn UP to access the cluster around (3,3)/(3,9).

Apples 8.\n    *   Enemy moved UP from (3, 0) to (3, 1).\n\n*   **Apples remaining (15 total):** (9, 9), (9, 1), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 2), (7, 5), (0, 3), (8, 8), (0, 7), (3, 9), (0, 5), (3, 3), (9, 7), (6, 2), (3, 2).\n\n*   **Scores:** Enemy 8, Me 7. I am still trailing by 1 apple.\n\n**1. Evaluate Potential Moves from My Head (8, 0):**\n\n*   **Obstacles/Dangers:**\n    *   My body: (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4).\n    *   Enemy head (3, 1) and body segments are far away.\n\n*   **UP to (8, 1):** Empty space. Safe. Moves toward (9, 1) apple.\n*   **DOWN to (8, -1):** Off the board. Deadly.\n*   **LEFT to (7, 0):** Into my body segment. Deadly (Moving backwards).\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 0):** Empty space. Safe. Moves toward (9, 1).\n\n**2. Analyze Optimal Apple Targets:**\n\nI am on the right edge (x=8) and bottom edge (y=0). Nearby apples are:\n1.  **(9, 1):** 2 moves away (E.g., RIGHT, UP or UP, RIGHT)\n2.  **(9, 2):** 3 moves away.\n3.  **(9, 7):** Further away.\n\nThe apple at **(9, 1)** is the immediate target. I need to move to x=9 and y=1.\n\n*   **Option A: Move UP to (8, 1).**\n    *   Next turn I can move RIGHT to (9, 1) and eat the apple.\n*   **Option B: Move RIGHT to (9, 0).**\n    *   Next turn I can move UP to (9, 1) and eat the apple.\n\nBoth options lead to capturing the apple at (9, 1) in T17. Let's check for enemy interference.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake 0's Position and Likely Moves (Head at (3, 1)):**\n\nEnemy 0 is at (3, 1). Nearby apples for the enemy:\n1.  **(3, 2):** 1 move (UP).\n2.  **(3, 3):** 2 moves (UP, UP).\n3.  **(6, 2):** Farther.\n4.  **(0, 3), (0, 5), (0, 7):** Farther, but likely target if they move LEFT.\n\nThe most likely and optimal move for Snake 0 is **UP to (3, 2)** to eat the apple there.\n\n*   If Enemy 0 moves U to (3, 2) (eats apple). Head is 8 moves away horizontally, 1-8 moves away vertically. No danger of collision.\n\n**4. Optimal Move Determination for Snake 1:**\n\nSince both UP and RIGHT moves for Snake 1 are safe and lead to the (9, 1) apple next turn, either is acceptable.\n\n*   Moving **UP to (8, 1)** sets up a RIGHT move to the apple (9, 1). It also moves the snake off the bottom wall, offering a little more immediate space.\n*   Moving **RIGHT to (9, 0)** moves along the boundary, setting up an UP move to the apple (9, 1).\n\nI will choose **UP** to (8, 1). This keeps me central relative to the apple targets (9, 1) and (9, 2) on the right edge, and avoids hugging the very corner (9, 0) which would slightly limit the options if something unexpected happened on the next turn.\n\n**5. Long-Term Plan Strategy (Next 3 turns):**\n1. T16: UP to (8, 1). Head at (8, 1).\n2. T17: RIGHT to (9, 1). Eat apple. Head at (9, 1). Score 8.\n3. T18: Target (9, 2). Move UP to (9, 2). Eat apple. Head at (9, 2). Score 9.\n4. T19: Target (9, 7) or (8, 8). Use current position (9, 2) to move UP and LEFT along the right edge.\n\nUP",

Determine Optimal Move based on Targets and Safety:**\n\nI have only two safe, viable moves: UP and DOWN.\n\n*   **Move UP to (9, 2):** This move immediately secures an apple. It aligns perfectly with my strategy of clearing the right edge and moving toward the high-value cluster of apples on the right side (9, 7, 9, 9, 8, 8). This is the highest priority move.\n*   **Move DOWN to (9, 0):** This is safe, but leads away from the denser core of remaining apples and might trap me against the bottom edge when I want to move up the right side. It offers no immediate reward.\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake 0's Position (Head at (3, 3)):**\n\nEnemy 0 is at (3, 3). Nearby apples for the enemy:\n1.  **(0, 3):** LEFT (3 moves).\n2.  **(3, 9):** UP (6 moves).\n3.  **(6, 2):** RIGHT (3 moves).\n4.  **(4, 5):** R, U, U (3 moves).\n\nThe enemy could move:\n*   **LEFT to (2, 3):** Cleans up the bottom left.\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 3):** Starts moving towards the center/right.\n*   **UP to (3, 4):** Starts moving towards (3, 9).\n\nGiven its history, the enemy might pursue (0, 3) or (4, 5). No matter what, the enemy is far away and poses no threat to my current position or objective.\n\n**4. Optimal Move Selection:**\n\nMoving **UP** to (9, 2) is the only logical choice as it provides an immediate apple and continues the right-side route.\n\n**5. Long-Term Plan Strategy (Next 3 turns):**\n1.  T18: UP to (9, 2). Eat apple. Head at (9, 2). Score 9.\n2.  T19: Target (9, 7). Move UP along the right edge: (9, 3). Head at (9, 3).\n3.

Safe, but leads toward my tail (1,3) which will vacate only if I don't eat; slower progress.\n- DOWN -> (3,2): my neck -> illegal (would hit myself).\n\nEnemy head (9,1) has neck at (8,1), so it cannot move into (8,1). Its only reasonable moves are UP to (9,2) (an apple) or DOWN to (9,0). No immediate threat or head-on contest for any of my adjacent squares this turn.\n\nEvaluation:\n- UP keeps me on column x=3, progressing toward the apple cluster up the board (apple at (3,9) is reachable). From (3,4) I have three open exits (up/left/right) next turn, which preserves mobility and reduces risk of getting boxed.\n- RIGHT moves toward the apple at (4,5) but would put me next to enemy body at (5,3), slightly increasing collision risk and potentially reducing safe options.\n- LEFT is safe but less aggressive toward high-value apples and risks longer routing.\n\nShort plan (for next turns):\n- Take UP now to continue north along x=3 toward (3,9). After securing the northern apples, use the open left/top area to loop and collect apples near x=0\u20134 while avoiding drifting right into the enemy cluster (x=5\u20139). Keep moves that preserve 2+ escape options each turn to avoid being trapped.\n\nUP",

Let's use the provided body list and head location.\n    *   The enemy board representation (T) shows segments at: (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2). This matches the body provided, except the board text is inconsistent: (3, 4) is marked '0', (3, 3) is marked 'T'.

Moves toward the cluster (8, 5), (8, 6).\n*   **RIGHT to (10, 2):** Off board (X=10). Deadly.\n\n**2. Determine Optimal Move based on Targets and Safety:**\n\nI have two safe, viable moves: UP and LEFT.\n\n*   **Target Analysis:**\n    *   Apples directly reachable: None.\n    *   Closest apples: (9, 7) (4 steps UP), (8, 8) (1 L, 6 U or 3 U, 1 L), (8, 5), (8, 6) (1 L, 3-4 U).\n    *   The path UP along the edge (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), then (9, 7) (apple) is very efficient and uncontested.\n\n*   **Move UP to (9, 3):** This maintains my position along the relatively safe right edge, directly aiming for (9, 7) and (9, 9). It keeps my long body out of the dense center and minimizes collision risk. This is the continuation of the plan from the last turn.\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 2):** This pivots toward the center/left. While closer to other apples, it brings me toward Snake 0's potential path, and my long body currently stretches down and left, making turns potentially more dangerous. It also delays reaching the immediate high-value apple (9, 7).\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake 0's Position (Head at (3, 4)):**\n\nEnemy is at (3, 4). It is focused on the left/center of the board.\nNearby apples for the enemy:\n1.  **(4, 5):** 1 R, 1 U. Very easy target.\n2.  **(2, 5):** 1 L, 1 U. Easy target.\n3.  **(0, 3):** 3 L, 1 D.\n4.  **(3, 9):** 5 U.\nThe enemy is likely aiming for (4, 5) or (2, 5). Moving to (3, 5) (U), (4, 4) (R), or (2, 4) (L) are all likely. None of these moves threaten my position at (9, 2).\n\n**4. Optimal Move Selection:**\n\nThe path **UP** is strategically superior as it is safe, uncontested, and leads directly to multiple high-scoring apples (9, 7, 9, 9). I must catch up to Snake 0.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Strategy (Next 3 turns):**\n1.  T19: UP to (9, 3). Head at (9, 3). Safely advance.\n2.  T20: UP to (9, 4). Head at (9, 4). Continue advancement.\n3.

Tail is (0, 2).\n    *   The enemy moved from (3, 4) to (3, 5) (UP), eating an apple at (3, 5) or moving into an empty space that was previously the head position, which suggests they grew in the previous turn. Looking at the board, (3, 5) is marked '0' (Head of Snake 0) and the spot (4, 5) is an Apple 'A'.\n\n*   **Apples remaining (15 total):** (9, 9), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 5), (0, 3), (8, 8), (0, 7), (3, 9), (0, 5), (9, 7), (6, 2), (6, 9), (1, 9), (4, 5), (2, 5).\n*   **Scores:** Enemy 10, Me 9.

Moves toward the center/left group.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (10, 3):** Off board (X=10). Deadly.\n\n**2. Determine Optimal Move based on Targets and Safety:**\n\nI have two safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\n*   **Target Assessment:**\n    *   My current path UP along the right wall is secure and leads efficiently to (9, 7) (4 cells away) and (9, 9) (6 cells away).\n    *   Moving LEFT takes me toward the center, (8, 3). From there I could approach (8, 5), (8, 6), or (7, 5). This route is longer to reach the guaranteed right-wall apples and could risk collision with my own body segments (8, 1), (8, 0) or the enemy if they shift right.\n\n*   **Enemy Analysis (Head at 3, 5):**\n    *   The enemy is still clustered on the left side. Apples they might target immediately: (4, 5) *very tempting, 1 R*, (2, 5) *1 L*, (3, 9) *4 U*.\n    *   If Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (4, 5), they eat an apple and grow. This is the most likely move.\n    *   No matter what the enemy does, our current move up the right wall remains isolated and safe.\n\n*   **Safety and Efficiency:**\n    *   Moving UP to (9, 4) is the safest and most direct continuation of the plan to secure the high-value apples on the right edge (9, 7) and (9, 9). This minimizes navigation complexity for my long body.\n\n**3. Move Selection:**\nI will move UP to (9, 4).\n\n**Long-Term Plan Strategy (Next 3 turns):**\n1. T20: UP to (9, 4). Head at (9, 4). Continue advancement.\n2. T21: UP to (9, 5). Head at (9, 5). Continue advancement.\n3. T22: UP to (9, 6). Head at (9, 6). Positioned one step below (9, 7).\n\nUP",

Apples 10.\n    *   Body: [(3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1)].\n    *   Last turn, Snake 0 moved from (3, 5) to (3, 6). The board shows '0' at (3, 6) and 'T' at (3, 5). This means they moved UP and ate the apple at (3, 6) if there was one, or moved into an empty space. Looking at the board (3, 6) is an empty space now. The apple list shows (4, 5) was an apple. Given the head is at (3, 6) now, they moved UP from (3, 5). If they moved UP, they didn't eat (4, 5) yet. (3, 6) is empty on the current board '6 . . . 0 . . . . A .'. This means the enemy moved UP from (3, 5) to (3, 6) and did *not* eat an apple (or the apple was at (3, 6) and is now gone). Their tail (0, 1) will move / disappear, freeing (0, 1).\n\n*   **Apples remaining (15 total):** (9, 9), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 5), (0, 3), (8, 8), (0, 7), (3, 9), (0, 5), (9, 7), (6, 2), (6, 9), (1, 9), (4, 5), (2, 5).\n*   **Scores:** Enemy 10, Me 9.

Oh, wait, the board legend says A at (9, 7) and (9, 9). The current apple list is the source of truth if there is a conflict. Let's rely on the apple list: (9, 7) and (9, 9) are apples. (0, 5) is an apple, not (9, 5). The board shows (9, 4) is '1'. (9, 5) seems empty. Safe.\n*   **Move DOWN to (9, 3):** Into my body segment. Deadly.\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 4):** Empty space. Safe.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (10, 4):** Off board. Deadly.\n\n**2. Determine Optimal Move based on Targets and Safety:**\n\nI have two safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n\n*   **Target Assessment:**\n    *   We are positioned on the right wall, aiming for apples (9, 7) and (9, 9).\n    *   (9, 7) is 3 steps away (UP, UP, UP).\n    *   (9, 9) is 5 steps away.\n    *   Moving UP to (9, 5) maintains the high-efficiency path towards these apples.\n    *   Moving LEFT to (8, 4) starts a pivot towards the center group of apples (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 5), (4, 5). This route is less direct for the immediate closest target (9, 7) and introduces more body collision risks later unless I turn immediately towards the top or bottom wall.\n\n*   **Enemy Analysis (Head at 3, 6):**\n    *   Enemy is at (3, 6). They have several high-value apples nearby they might target: (3, 9) (3 U), (0, 7) (3 L, 1 U), (4, 5) (1 R, 1 D), (2, 5) (1 L, 1 D).\n    *   If the enemy goes RIGHT to (4, 6), they are getting slightly closer to the middle of the board.\n    *   If the enemy goes UP, they target (3, 9).\n    *   If the enemy goes DOWN/LEFT, they target the cluster near 5 and 6 Y.\n    *   The enemy's actions are unlikely to interfere with my movement along the right wall for the next few turns.\n\n*   **Safety and Efficiency:**\n    *   UP to (9, 5) is the most straightforward, safe, and efficient move to secure the apples on the right side, especially (9, 7). This keeps the snake streamlined and minimizes internal threats.\n\n**3. Move Selection:**\nI will move UP to (9, 5).\n\n**Long-Term Plan Strategy (Next 3 turns):**\n1. T21: UP to (9, 5).

Length 11 (grew last turn because I moved UP to (9, 5) and ate an apple implicitly, although my previous rationale assumed (9, 5) was empty. Let's verify the body length change. $10 \\to 11$. Apples $9 \\to 9$. Wait, the length is given as 11 segments: (9, 5) + 10 body segments = 11. My apples are still 9. This means I did *not* eat an apple (9, 4) $\\to$ (9, 5). The previous body had [(9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1)]. The tail (6, 1) was the end. Now the tail is (6, 1). If I didn't eat, the tail should have moved to (6, 2) or disappeared. Length must have remained 11. My current body list is 10 segments long, including the head: $1 + 10 = 11$. The tail is (6, 1). If I did not eat, the tail (6, 1) should disappear, and the body list should be 9, meaning length 10.\n    *   Let's check the provided state carefully:\n        *   Head: (9, 5)\n        *   Body: [(9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1)] (9 segments listed here, which means total length 10: Head + 9 Body).\n    *   Okay, I was length 10 last turn (9, 4) + 9 body segments. Now I am length 10: (9, 5) + 9 body segments. This confirms I moved from (9, 4) to (9, 5) and *did not* eat an apple. The tail (6, 1) is now free.\n*   **Enemy Snake 0 (ID 0):** Head at (3, 7). Length 12 (grew, ate an apple). Apples 10 $\\to$ 10 (Wait, apple count didn't change this turn either. Let's assume the provided score is the state *after* Turn 21 movements but before Turn 22 movement).\n    *   The enemy moved from (3, 6) to (3, 7). Length: 1 + 10 body = 11 last turn. Now 1 + 10 body = 11. They also did not grow.\n\n*   **Apples remaining (15 total):** (9, 9), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 5), (0, 3), (8, 8), (0, 7), (3, 9), (0, 5), (9, 7), (6, 2), (6, 9), (1, 9), (4, 5), (2, 5).\n*   **Scores:** Enemy 10, Me 9. I am trailing by 1 apple.\n\n**1. Evaluate Potential Moves from My Head (9, 5):**\n\n*   **Move UP to (9, 6):** Empty space. Safe. Direct path towards (9, 7) Apple.\n*   **Move DOWN to (9, 4):** Into my body segment. Deadly.\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 5):** Apple! Eating this apple (8, 5) would give me a point, raise my score to 10, and put me level with the enemy. It's a key move.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (10, 5):** Off board. Deadly.\n\n**2. Determine Optimal Move based on Targets and Safety:**\n\nI have two safe choices: UP or LEFT.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 5):**\n    *   Pros: Immediate apple acquisition. Levels the score.\n    *   Cons: Requires checking for head-on collision. Snake 0 is far away (3, 7). The path is clear. This is a very strong option.\n\n*   **Move UP to (9, 6):**\n    *   Pros: Continues the path towards (9, 7) and (9, 9) apples. Maintains position on the wall.\n    *   Cons: Delays scoring. (9, 7) is 2 moves away (UP, UP). (8, 5) is 1 move away (LEFT).\n\nSince (8, 5) is an immediate apple, acquiring it is highly advantageous, both for score and length increase (which provides defensive benefits).\n\n**3. Safety Check for (8, 5):**\n\n*   My move: (9, 5) $\\to$ (8, 5).\n*   Enemy Head: (3, 7).\n*   Enemy potential moves: (3, 8/9), (2, 7), (4, 7). None of these threaten (8, 5).\n\nThe move LEFT to (8, 5) is safe and guarantees an apple.\n\n**4. Move Selection:**\nI will move LEFT to capture the apple at (8, 5).\n\n**Long-Term Plan Strategy (Next few turns):**\n1. T22: LEFT to (8, 5). EAT. Score 10. Length 11.\n2. T23: From (8, 5), I will assess nearby apples: (8, 6) (1 U), (7, 5) (1 L). I should likely target (8, 6) or (8, 8). (8, 6) is a very easy follow-up. UP to (8, 6).\n3. T24: From (8, 6), target (8, 8). UP, UP.\n\nI prioritize securing immediate apples since the score is close.\n\nLEFT",

If safe, move UP again to (3,9) to get that apple on the following turn.\n- After taking (3,9), reassess: then approach nearby top apples (1,9) or (6,9) depending on enemy movements, avoiding immediate growth into tight corridors.\n\nUP",

Both are 1 move away and both are safe from self-collision or board edge collision.\n\n*   **Target (8, 6) [UP]:**\n    *   If I move UP, my new position is (8, 6).\n    *   This keeps me generally aligned towards the high-value apples further north (8, 8), (9, 9), (9, 7).\n    *   The area around (8, 6) is relatively open.\n\n*   **Target (7, 5) [LEFT]:**\n    *   If I move LEFT, my new position is (7, 5).\n    *   This moves me towards the center left, potentially blocking access from Snake 0 who is currently at (3, 8).\n    *   The next nearest apples are (6, 2) and (4, 5).\n\n**3. Head Collision Risk Assessment:**\n\nEnemy Snake 0 is at (3, 8).\nPossible Enemy moves: (3, 9) [Apple], (4, 8), (2, 8), (3, 7) [Body].\n\n*   If Snake 0 moves (3, 9) or (4, 8) or (2, 8), they are far from me and collision is impossible.\n*   If Snake 0 attempts to move to (3, 7), they hit their body and die (which we assume the enemy won't do).\n\nSince the enemy is far away (minimum distance 5 cells), there is no head-on collision risk with either (8, 6) or (7, 5).\n\n**4. Strategic Choice: UP vs. LEFT**\n\nBoth moves are excellent as they guarantee a score lead (11-10).\n\nLook at the future state:\nA) If I move **UP to (8, 6)**:\n    *   Next apples easily reachable: (8, 8) [2 U], (9, 7) [2 R, 1 U], (4, 5) [4 L, 1 D].\n    *   This position keeps me dominant on the right side of the board and allows sequential apple captures (8, 6) $\\to$ (8, 8).\n\nB) If I move **LEFT to (7, 5)**:\n    *   Next apples easily reachable: (4, 5) [3 L], (6, 2) [1 L, 3 D].\n    *   This centralizes my position and might force the enemy to move away from the high-y apples.\n\nGiven the cluster of apples along the right wall (9, 7), (8, 8), (9, 9), continuing the upward movement seems strategically superior to maximize sequential scoring opportunities without major turns. Moving UP to (8, 6) sets me up perfectly for (8, 8).\n\n**5. Final Move Selection:** UP\n\n**Long-Term Plan Strategy (Next few turns):**\n1. T23: UP to (8, 6). EAT. Score 11.\n2. T24: From (8, 6), move UP towards (8, 8).\n3. T25: From (8, 7), move UP to (8, 8). EAT. Score 12.\n4. T26: From (8, 8), target (9, 9) or (9, 7). (9, 7) is 1 R, 1 D. (9, 9) is 1 R, 1 U.\n\nUP",

Evaluate Potential Moves from My Head (8, 7):**\n\n*   **Move UP to (8, 8):** This is an apple (A)! Safe and guarantees 1 point.\n*   **Move DOWN to (8, 6):** Into my body. Deadly.\n*   **Move LEFT to (7, 7):** Empty space. Safe.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (9, 7):** This is an apple (A)! Safe and guarantees 1 point.\n\n**2. Analyze Optimal Moves (Apple Options):**\n\nI have two immediate apple choices:\n1.  **UP to (8, 8):**\n2.  **RIGHT to (9, 7):**\n\nBoth moves are safe and result in eating an apple and increasing my score to 12.\n\n*   **Comparing (8, 8) and (9, 7):**\n    *   (8, 8) is slightly more centered towards the remaining cluster of apples (9, 9) and (6, 9).\n    *   (9, 7) pushes me right against the wall, but also positions me well for (9, 9). (9, 9) is 2 moves away (via (9, 8)).\n\nLet's look at the geometry:\n*   If I move UP to (8, 8): Next turn I can move RIGHT to (9, 8) (empty) or UP to (8, 9) (empty). Both lead towards the (9, 9) apple.\n*   If I move RIGHT to (9, 7): Next turn I must move UP to (9, 8) (empty, next to wall) to target (9, 9), or DOWN to (9, 6) (empty).\n\nThe path via (8, 8) (UP) offers slightly better central control and flexibility for the subsequent move, though both are excellent. Given the plan was to target (8, 8), I should stick with it unless there is a strong reason not to.\n\n**3. Head Collision Risk Assessment:**\n\nEnemy Snake 0 is at (2, 9).\nPossible Enemy moves:\n*   (1, 9): Apple (A). Most likely move.\n*   (3, 9): Into body. Death.\n*   (2, 8): Empty. Safe.\n*   (2, 10): Out of bounds. Death.\n\nThe enemy is focusing on the top left corner. My move on the top right corner is completely safe from immediate Pincer/Head-on collision (minimum distance is 6 cells if they move to (1, 9)).\n\n**4. Strategic Choice:**\n\nMoving UP to (8, 8) is the most direct continuation of my current strategy, secures an apple, and maintains flexibility for the next apple cluster (9, 9) and (6, 9).\n\n(8, 8) -> Next target: (9, 9) or (9, 7) now that (9, 7) is open.\nIf I go to (8, 8) this turn:\nT26 options:\n1.  RIGHT to (9, 8): Sets up (9, 9) next turn.\n2.  LEFT to (7, 8): Opens up movement laterally.\n3.  UP to (8, 9): Sets up (9, 9) in 2 turns.\n\nI will choose UP to (8, 8).\n\n**Long-Term Plan Strategy (Next few turns):**\n1. T25: UP to (8, 8). EAT. Score 12.\n2. T26: Aim for (9, 9). Move RIGHT to (9, 8).\n3. T27: Move UP to (9, 9). EAT. Score 13.\n4. T28: From (9, 9), look for next nearby apple, potentially (6, 9) or move down the right wall.\n\nUP",

The enemy is concentrated on the right side of the board and is not an immediate head-on threat.\n- DOWN to (2,8) is safe but doesn't take the nearby apple and stalls progress toward the left apple cluster. It also leaves me closer to my long vertical body at x=3, which can create tighter maneuvering later.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Moving LEFT does not move into any snake body and is not a head-on collision risk this turn. Growing by one segment is acceptable here because the left and downward space toward x=0 apples is open and gives escape routes.\n\nShort plan:\n- Take (1,9) this turn, then head toward (1,7) and the x=0 apples ((0,7),(0,5),(0,3)). Avoid getting trapped by my own long vertical body at x=3; keep paths open downward and left. Monitor Snake #1\u2019s movement on the right and avoid re-entering that crowded area.\n\nLEFT",

This was a move RIGHT from (8, 8) last turn.\n    *   Length: 13.\n    *   Body: [(8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0)].\n    *   Apples Collected: 12.\n*   **Enemy Snake 0:**\n    *   Head: (1, 8). (Hypothesized move DOWN from (1, 9) where the apple was).\n    *   Length: 14 (Must have eaten an apple).\n    *   Body: [(1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (3, 2), (3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0)].\n    *   Apples Collected: 13.\n    *   *Observation:* Snake 0 successfully moved from (1, 9) down to (1, 8) and ate the apple, increasing its score to 13. I am now one apple behind.\n\n*   **Apples remaining (14 total, two eaten last turn):** (9, 9), (7, 5), (0, 3), (0, 7), (0, 5), (9, 7), (6, 2), (6, 9), (4, 5), (2, 5), (5, 3), (5, 6), (1, 7), (1, 4), (4, 0).\n    *   (9, 9) is directly above my head (9, 8).\n    *   (9, 7) is directly below my head (9, 8).\n    *   (6, 9) is relatively close.\n\n**1. Evaluate Potential Moves from My Head (9, 8):**\n\n*   **Move UP to (9, 9):** Safe. This is an apple (A). Optimal scoring move.\n*   **Move DOWN to (9, 7):** Safe. This is an apple (A). Good scoring move.\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 8):** Into my body (the segment just moved from). Deadly.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (10, 8):** Out of bounds. Deadly.\n\n**2. Strategic Choice:**\n\nBoth UP to (9, 9) and DOWN to (9, 7) are apples.\n\n*   If I move **UP to (9, 9)**, I eat the apple, bringing my score to 13, tying Snake 0. My new head is (9, 9). The space below me (9, 8) becomes the new tail position next turn (if not growing). I am well-positioned to then go DOWN to (9, 7) (if it doesn't get eaten by the enemy's tail or something unexpected).\n*   If I move **DOWN to (9, 7)**, I eat the apple, bringing my score to 13. My new head is (9, 7). I can then move UP to (9, 8) or (9, 9) next turn. (9, 8) is safe empty space; (9, 9) is where the other apple is.\n\nBoth moves are excellent. Choosing UP to (9, 9) secures the higher corner first, keeping options open along the right wall.\n\n**3. Safety and Collision Check:**\n\n*   **Self-Collision:** All safe moves avoid my body.\n*   **Enemy Collision:**\n    *   Enemy Head 0 is at (1, 8). It is far away from (9, 9) or (9, 7).\n    *   Possible moves for Snake 0 from (1, 8):\n        *   UP to (1, 9): Into body. (Dead).\n        *   DOWN to (1, 7): Apple (A). Most likely move, continuing down the left wall.\n        *   LEFT to (0, 8): Empty.\n        *   RIGHT to (2, 8): Empty.\n    *   There is no risk of collision.\n\n**4. Final Decision:**\n\nChoose UP to eat the (9, 9) apple.\n\n**Long-Term Plan Strategy Note to Future Self (T28+):**\n1. T27: UP to (9, 9). EAT. Score 13.\n2. T28: Move DOWN to (9, 8) (empty, safe) or DOWN to (9, 7) (Apple). Since (9, 7) is adjacent and an apple, prioritize DOWN to secure the second apple.\n3. T29: Look towards the center or the (6, 9) apple.\n\nUP",

Let's re-check the body segment rule.*\nMy body list is: [(9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0)]. (Length 13 segments).\nThe previous head was (9, 8). I moved (9, 8) -> (9, 9) and grew.\nMy new head is (9, 9).\nThe next segment is (9, 8).\nIf I move DOWN to (9, 8), I hit my own body. **Therefore, DOWN is deadly.**\n\n**Only SAFE move is LEFT to (8, 9).**\n\n**2. Strategic Implications for LEFT (8, 9):**\n\n1.  **Safety:** LEFT is safe.\n2.  **Goal:** I must try to catch up to Snake 0 (currently 14 apples).\n3.  **Next Turn:** From (8, 9), I have access to:\n    *   UP (8, 10): Deadly (Wall).\n    *   DOWN (8, 8): My body segment. Deadly.\n    *   LEFT (7, 9): Empty, heading towards (6, 9) apple.\n    *   RIGHT (9, 9): My body (The head's previous location). Deadly.\n\n*Wait again!* If I move LEFT to (8, 9), and I do *not* eat an apple (which I won't, as (8, 9) is empty), my tail (7, 0) will vacate.\nMy new body segments will shift: (9, 9) -> (9, 8) -> (8, 8) -> ... -> (8, 0). (7, 0) is free.\nNext turn, I will be at (8, 9).\nFrom (8, 9):\n*   To (7, 9): Safe, empty. Moving toward (6, 9) apple.\n*   To (9, 9): Into my body (the segment just moved from). Deadly.\n*   To (8, 8): Into my body (the segment behind (9, 8)). Deadly.\n*   To (8, 10): Out of bounds.\n\nThis path seems restrictive, but it's the only immediate safe move.\n\n*Let's check alternative directions again carefully.*\n\n*   **DOWN to (9, 8):** (9, 8) is the first segment of my body. Immediate death.\n*   **UP / RIGHT:** Off board. Immediate death.\n\n**Conclusion: LEFT is the only safe move.**\n\n**3. Planning for the Apple (6, 9):**\n\n1.  T28: Move **LEFT** to (8, 9). (Safe, empty).\n2.  T29: Move **LEFT** to (7, 9). (Safe, empty).\n    *   From (7, 9): UP/DOWN/RIGHT are safe (assuming no enemy collision, which is unlikely).\n3.  T30: Move **LEFT** to (6, 9). EAT Apple A. Score 14. Tie Snake 0.\n\nThis seems like a solid, forced sequence to capture the next available apple. I must secure the path toward (6, 9) now.\n\n**4. Enemy Snake 0 Consideration:**\nHead is at (1, 7).\nPossible moves for Snake 0:\n*   UP (1, 8): Into body segment. Deadly.\n*   DOWN (1, 6): Safe, empty.\n*   LEFT (0, 7): Apple A. HIGHLY likely move.\n*   RIGHT (2, 7): Safe, empty.\n\nSnake 0 is heavily favored to move LEFT to (0, 7) and eat the apple there. This doesn't affect my plan to move towards (6, 9).\n\n**Long-Term Plan Strategy Note to Future Self (T29+):**\n1. T28: Move LEFT to (8, 9). This was forced.\n2. T29: Aim to continue LEFT to (7, 9), securing the path to the (6, 9) apple.\n3. T30: Move LEFT to (6, 9) and eat the apple. Re-evaluate goal priority after T30 consumption.\n\nLEFT",

(I am now 2 apples behind).\n\n*   **Apples remaining (14 visible on board state minus (0, 7) eaten by S0):**\n    *   (7, 5), (0, 3), (0, 5), (9, 7), (6, 2), (6, 9), (4, 5), (2, 5), (5, 3), (5, 6), (1, 4), (4, 0), (6, 0), (5, 8), (7, 8). (Total 15 listed in game state. Let's rely on the board display for occupied vs apple, but the list confirms targets).\n    *   Closest available apples to my Head (8, 9):\n        1. (6, 9): Two moves LEFT (7, 9 -> 6, 9). High priority.\n        2. (9, 7): RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN. Complex path due to body if going right. Safer approach is just DOWN to (8, 8), but (8, 8) is my body.\n        3. (7, 8): LEFT, DOWN. (7, 8) is directly accessible in 2 moves: (8, 9) -> (7, 9) -> (7, 8).\n\n**1. Evaluate Potential Moves from My Head (8, 9):**\n\n*   **Move UP to (8, 10):** Out of bounds. Deadly.\n*   **Move DOWN to (8, 8):** Into my body segment. (8, 8) is the fourth segment of my body list. Deadly.\n*   **Move LEFT to (7, 9):** Safe. Empty space. This continues the thrust toward the (6, 9) apple.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (9, 9):** Into my body segment (the previous head location). Deadly.\n\n*Self-Correction Check:* Since I did not eat an apple on T28, my tail segment (8, 0) will vacate. This doesn't open up any of the currently blockaded moves (DOWN or RIGHT) if I move to (7, 9).\n\n**Only SAFE move is LEFT to (7, 9).** The immediate path is predetermined by safety constraints.\n\n**2. Strategic Implications for LEFT (7, 9):**\n\n1.  **Safety:** LEFT is safe.\n2.  **Apple Access:** Moving to (7, 9) sets me up directly for the (6, 9) apple next turn (T30). This is crucial to catch up to Snake 0.\n3.  **Future Options from (7, 9) (T30):**\n    *   UP (7, 10): Deadly (Wall).\n    *   DOWN (7, 8): Apple (7, 8). Excellent option if (6, 9) is somehow blocked or less desirable. Requires one move DOWN.\n    *   LEFT (6, 9): Apple (6, 9). High priority. Requires one move LEFT.\n    *   RIGHT (8, 9): My body. Deadly.\n\nBoth (6, 9) and (7, 8) are reachable in one move from (7, 9). This is a great position.\n\n**3. Enemy Snake 0 Consideration (Head at (0, 7)):**\nSnake 0 just ate (0, 7). They are long and currently on the left edge.\nPossible moves for Snake 0 from (0, 7):\n*   UP (0, 8): Safe, empty.\n*   DOWN (0, 6): Safe, empty.\n*   LEFT (-1, 7): Wall. Deadly.\n*   RIGHT (1, 7): Body segment (the segment they just came from). Deadly.\n\nSnake 0 is essentially trapped between the wall and their own body. They must move UP to (0, 8) or DOWN to (0, 6).\n*   If S0 moves UP to (0, 8), they are near the top, possibly heading for (0, 9) (empty) or (1, 9) (body).\n    *   If S0 tries to go to (0, 5) (apple) down the wall, UP is wrong.\n    *   If S0 tries to go to (6, 9) (my target), UP is potentially better, but currently they look far away.\n*   If S0 moves DOWN to (0, 6), they are closer to apples (0, 5) and (0, 3). This is the most logical path for them.\n\nS0's movement does not threaten my immediate apple target (6, 9) or (7, 8).\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nThe move LEFT is the only safe option and optimally positions me to consume either (6, 9) or (7, 8) next turn, allowing me to close the gap with Snake 0.\n\n--Short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns:--\nT29: Move LEFT to (7, 9). This was forced.\nT30: From (7, 9), prioritize the apple (6, 9) (move LEFT). If enemy movement somehow blocks (6, 9), resort to (7, 8) (move DOWN). The primary goal is to eat an apple to reduce the score gap.\nT31+: Re-evaluate based on the new head position (6, 9 or 7, 8) and remaining apples, especially (9, 7), (5, 8), and those on the opposite side (0, 5), (0, 3).\n\nLEFT",

(15 total).\n\n*   **Closest available apples to my Head (7, 9):**\n    1.  (6, 9): 1 move LEFT. CRITICAL TARGET.\n    2.  (7, 8): 1 move DOWN. Second best target.\n    3.  (5, 8): 2 moves (LEFT, DOWN) or (DOWN, LEFT).\n    4.  (9, 7): 3 moves (RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN if clear).\n\n**1. Evaluate Potential Moves from My Head (7, 9):**\n\n*   **Move UP to (7, 10):** Out of bounds. Deadly.\n*   **Move DOWN to (7, 8):** Safe. Apple (7, 8). Excellent option.\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 9):** Safe. Apple (6, 9). Excellent option.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (8, 9):** Into my body segment. Deadly.\n\n**2. Strategic Decision Between LEFT (6, 9) and DOWN (7, 8):**\n\nBoth moves result in eating an apple and are immediately safe.\n\n*   **Option A: LEFT to (6, 9) [Apple]:**\n    *   New Head: (6, 9). Body expands. My length increases to 15.\n    *   Future options from (6, 9):\n        *   UP (6, 10): Wall.\n        *   DOWN (6, 8): Safe.\n        *   LEFT (5, 9): Safe.\n        *   RIGHT (7, 9): Now body (previous head position). Deadly.\n    *   This keeps me along the top edge. Good for accessing the (5, 8) or possibly swinging down later.\n\n*   **Option B: DOWN to (7, 8) [Apple]:**\n    *   New Head: (7, 8). Body expands. My length increases to 15.\n    *   Future options from (7, 8):\n        *   UP (7, 9): Now body (previous head position). Deadly.\n        *   DOWN (7, 7): Safe.\n        *   LEFT (6, 8): Safe.\n        *   RIGHT (8, 8): Into my body (5th segment). Deadly.\n    *   This moves me inward. It potentially sets me up for (7, 5) or (5, 8).\n\n**3. Goal Prioritization and Constraint Check:**\n\nThe primary goal is to eat an apple quickly. Both succeed. (6, 9) is on the very edge, which sometimes limits future movement, but (7, 8) is flanked by my body at (8, 8) and currently (7, 9).\n\nLet's look at the remaining apples after eating (6, 9) vs (7, 8).\nIf I eat (6, 9): (7, 8) remains a close target.\nIf I eat (7, 8): (6, 9) remains a close target.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 9), my body now hugs the top wall: (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8)...\nFrom (6, 9), I can move S to (6, 8) or W to (5, 9).\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 8), my body is: (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8)...\nFrom (7, 8), I can move S to (7, 7) or W to (6, 8).\n\nThe move LEFT (6, 9) provides slightly better immediate openness as I avoid boxing myself in between my body segments at (7, 9) and (8, 8). If I move DOWN to (7, 8), moving RIGHT to (8, 8) is immediately blocked by my body, and moving UP is blocked by my body (7, 9). I would be restricted to (7, 7) or (6, 8).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 9), moving right is blocked by (7, 9), but I have (6, 8) and (5, 9). This feels marginally safer and opens up the corner more cleanly. Additionally, Snake 0 is far away on the left side and not threatening either apple.\n\nI choose LEFT to (6, 9).\n\n**4. Check for Collisions with Enemy Snake 0:**\nS0 Head: (0, 6). They will likely try to move DOWN to (0, 5) (apple) or RIGHT to (1, 6) or possibly stay on the wall (0, 7) (body).\nSafe moves for S0: DOWN to (0, 5) [Apple], or RIGHT to (1, 6).\n*   If S0 moves DOWN to (0, 5), they eat an apple and become 3 apples ahead.\n*   If S0 moves RIGHT to (1, 6), they move away from the wall.\n\nRegardless of S0's move, they pose no threat to me near (7, 9).\n\n**Conclusion:** Move LEFT to consume the apple at (6, 9).\n\n--Short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns:--\nT31: After eating (6, 9), the next priority is (7, 8) or (5, 8). From (6, 9), move DOWN to (6, 8) and then RIGHT to (7, 8). Alternatively, move LEFT to (5, 9) and head towards (5, 8). Choose the path that keeps me away from potential entrapment, prioritizing (7, 8) since it is closer to the main body clump of apples. The goal remains to eat apples aggressively to overcome S0's lead.\nLEFT",

Continue to (0,3) to take both apples on column 0.\n- After sweeping column 0, head toward (1,4) / (2,5) or move right into open space while avoiding the tight corridor near x=3 and staying away from Snake #1's right-side territory.\n\nDOWN",

(I am 2 apples behind).\n\n*   **Apples remaining:** (7, 5), (0, 3), (9, 7), (6, 2), (4, 5), (2, 5), (5, 3), (5, 6), (1, 4), (4, 0), (6, 0), (5, 8), (7, 8), (2, 0), (4, 3) (15 total).\n\n**1. Identify Closest Targets from My Head (6, 9):**\n1.  (7, 8): 2 moves (DOWN, RIGHT).\n2.  (5, 8): 2 moves (LEFT, DOWN).\n3.  (5, 6): 3 moves (DOWN, DOWN, LEFT) or (LEFT, DOWN, DOWN).\n\n**2. Evaluate Potential Moves from My Head (6, 9):**\n\n*   **Move UP to (6, 10):** Out of bounds. Deadly.\n*   **Move DOWN to (6, 8):** Safe. No apple. Leads towards (7, 8) or the center.\n*   **Move LEFT to (5, 9):** Safe. No apple. Leads towards (5, 8).\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 9):** Into my body segment. Deadly.\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT are safe. I must decide which path is better for securing the next apple quickly and safely.\n\n*   **Option A: DOWN to (6, 8)**\n    *   Path towards (7, 8): (6, 8) -> (7, 8) [Apple]. Total 2 moves.\n    *   Path towards (5, 8): (6, 8) -> (5, 8) [Apple]. Total 2 moves (LEFT).\n    *   (6, 8) is safe from Snake 0 interaction.\n    *   If I go to (6, 8), my head blocks access to the tail segment (8, 1) or the interior for a potential return if needed, but it opens up the board.\n\n*   **Option B: LEFT to (5, 9)**\n    *   Path towards (5, 8): (5, 9) -> (5, 8) [Apple]. Total 2 moves.\n    *   Path towards (7, 8): (5, 9) -> (6, 9) (Body) -> Not feasible. Must go (5, 9) -> (5, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (7, 8). Total 4 moves (much slower).\n    *   (5, 9) is safe from Snake 0 interaction (S0 is at (0, 5)).\n\n**3. Comparison and Rationale:**\n\nThe goal is to move efficiently to the next apple. Both (7, 8) and (5, 8) are 2 moves away.\n\nIf I choose DOWN to (6, 8):\nNext turn (T32): I can move RIGHT to (7, 8) [Apple], or LEFT to (5, 8) [Apple]. Moving RIGHT seems slightly more complex because (7, 8) is between my body segments at (7, 9) and (8, 8), but (7, 8) is currently clear.\n\nIf I choose LEFT to (5, 9):\nNext turn (T32): I can only move DOWN to (5, 8) [Apple]. This path is definite.\n\nChoosing LEFT (5, 9) commits me to (5, 8), which is great. It brings me off the immediate top edge and toward the center body of apples.\nChoosing DOWN (6, 8) gives me a choice between (7, 8) and (5, 8) on the next turn.\n\nLet's prioritize the most open and least restrictive path.\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 9) and then DOWN to (5, 8), I am in a good position to target (5, 6) or (4, 5).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 8):\nT32 options:\n1. RIGHT to (7, 8) [Apple]. This positions me next to my body (7, 9, 8, 8). Future movement from (7, 8) would be constrained: limited to (7, 7) or (6, 8) (backwards). This creates a potentially tight spot.\n2. LEFT to (5, 8) [Apple]. This is good, similar to the direct LEFT path.\n\nSince the direct LEFT path (5, 9) -> (5, 8) avoids the potentially constraining move into (7, 8), it seems strategically superior for maintaining flexibility.\n\n**4. External Snake Check (S0):**\nS0 Head: (0, 5). S0 has close apples at (0, 3) and possibly (1, 4). They are highly unlikely to cross the board to interfere with (5, 8) or (7, 8) in the next few turns.\n\nI will move LEFT towards (5, 8).\n\n--Short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns:--\nT32: Move DOWN to (5, 8) to secure the apple. After that, target (5, 6) or (4, 5), prioritizing continued movement down the left side towards the cluster of apples around column 4 and 5. Maintain momentum and avoid getting trapped along the walls now that I have moved inward.\nLEFT",

Body [(0, 4), (0, 5), ... (3, 2)]. Tail to vacate: (3, 1).\n    *   If S0 moved to (1, 4): Head (1, 4), Length 17. Body [(0, 4), (0, 5), ... (3, 2)]. Tail to vacate: (3, 1).\n    *   If S0 moved to (0, 2): Head (0, 2), Length 17. Body [(0, 3), (0, 4), ... (3, 2)]. Tail to vacate: (3, 1).\n    *   Given the visualization, S0 likely ate the apple at (0, 3). The new head position is (0, 3). The current board state confirms '0' at (0, 3).\n    *   Apples Collected: 17 (I am 2 apples behind).\n\n*   **Apples remaining (14 total):**\n    A1: (7, 5), A2: (9, 7), A3: (6, 2), A4: (4, 5), A5: (2, 5), A6: (5, 3), A7: (5, 6), A8: (1, 4), A9: (4, 0), A10: (6, 0), A11: (7, 8), A12: (2, 0), A13: (4, 3), A14: (6, 7).\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Goal:**\nI am at (5, 8). I need to catch up to Snake 0. I should target the nearest safe apples.\n\n**2. Evaluate Available Apples (and distance from (5, 8)):**\n1. (7, 8): Dist 2 (RIGHT, RIGHT).\n2. (5, 6): Dist 2 (DOWN, DOWN).\n3. (6, 7): Dist 2 (DOWN, RIGHT or RIGHT, DOWN).\n4. (4, 5): Dist 4 (LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN).\n5. (5, 3): Dist 5 (DOWN x5).\n6. (4, 3): Dist 6 (LEFT, DOWN x5).\n7. (6, 2): Dist 6 (DOWN x6).\n\nThe best immediate targets are (7, 8), (5, 6), and (6, 7).\n\n**3. Evaluate Potential Moves from My Head (5, 8):**\n\n*   **Move UP to (5, 9):** Into my body segment. Deadly.\n*   **Move DOWN to (5, 7):** Safe. Moves toward (5, 6) (1 move away) and (5, 3). This column (x=5) is relatively free until (5, 9).\n*   **Move LEFT to (4, 8):** Safe. Moves toward (4, 5) and (4, 3).\n*   **Move RIGHT to (6, 8):** Safe. Moves toward (7, 8) (1 move away) and (6, 7).\n\n**4. Safety and Collision Check:**\n\n*   Snake 0 Head is at (0, 3). It is very far away and poses no collision threat for the next couple of turns.\n\n**5. Comparing Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **A) Move DOWN to (5, 7):**\n    *   Pros: Keeps me central, directly targets (5, 6) for T34.\n    *   Cons: My surrounding body is quite constricting in the (9, y) and (8, y) columns, but (5, y) is open.\n*   **B) Move RIGHT to (6, 8):**\n    *   Pros: Targets (7, 8) for T34, and (6, 7) for T34/T35. This area seems slightly less congested currently than moving vertically down the middle, though I have body segments near (7, 9).\n*   **C) Move LEFT to (4, 8):**\n    *   Pros: Opens up the left side, potentially targeting (4, 5), (4, 3).\n    *   Cons: Pulls me away from the (7, 8) cluster.\n\nThe cluster of apples around (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8) is very dense.\n\nLet's prioritize closing the gap with Snake 0 while maintaining flexibility. (5, 7) and (6, 8) are equally appealing.\n\n*If I choose DOWN to (5, 7):*\nT34 target: (5, 6). Path: (5, 7) -> (5, 6). Safe.\n\n*If I choose RIGHT to (6, 8):*\nT34 target: (7, 8). Path: (6, 8) -> (7, 8). Safe.\n\nBoth paths lead to an apple in 1 turn. I will choose the path that potentially opens up better movement afterwards.\n\n*   From (5, 6) (after eating): Options include (5, 5), (4, 6), (6, 6). (5, 5) is safe, (4, 5) is 1 move away. (4, 5), (5, 3) are good targets.\n*   From (7, 8) (after eating): Options include (7, 7), (6, 8), (8, 8). (8, 8) is my body; (6, 8) is safe; (7, 7) is safe, leads towards (7, 5).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 8) seems slightly better as it utilizes space outside the tightly packed (5, y) column if I continue down towards (5, 3). The congestion around (8, 8) and (8, 7) is on my RHS, but (7, 8) is safe and opens up the horizontal movement towards (7, 5).\n\nI will go RIGHT to (6, 8) to secure the apple at (7, 8) next turn.\n\n**6. Final Decision:** RIGHT.\n\n--Short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns:--\nT34: Move to (7, 8) to eat the apple. T35: Move towards (7, 5) or (6, 7). Prioritize clearing the top right quadrant of available apples before going south towards (5, 6) or (4, 5). Stay aware of the large body segments around (8, y) and (9, y).\nRIGHT",

It also steers me away from the long body column at x=0 without committing into a dead-end.\n- DOWN to (0,2) could eventually take (0,1) in two moves, but it keeps me hugging the left edge and slightly reduces maneuvering space compared to moving into x=1 where I have more room to navigate toward other apples.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Move RIGHT to (1,3).\n- Next turn likely UP to eat (1,4), then proceed toward the nearby apples at (2,5)/(4,5)/(2,0)/(4,3) while avoiding the x=3 corridor where much of my body lies.\n\nRIGHT",

Determine Immediate Goal:**\nI am at (6, 8). The nearest apple is (7, 8) and (6, 7). Since I moved RIGHT last turn to get into position, (7, 8) is a one-move capture. Capturing apples is the priority to close the score gap (15 vs 17).\n\n**2. Evaluate Potential Moves from My Head (6, 8):**\n\n*   **UP to (6, 9):** Into my body. Deadly.\n*   **DOWN to (6, 7):** This is an apple! A15: (6, 7). Safe movement.\n*   **LEFT to (5, 8):** This is my body segment (position immediately behind the head). Deadly (moving backwards).\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 8):** This is an apple! A11: (7, 8). Safe movement.\n\n**3. Comparing Apple Moves (DOWN vs RIGHT):**\n\nBoth DOWN (to (6, 7)) and RIGHT (to (7, 8)) capture an apple this turn. Both moves are safe in terms of immediate self-collision and enemy collision (Snake 0 is far).\n\n*   **If I move DOWN to (6, 7):**\n    *   Eats apple (6, 7).\n    *   Next potential targets: (7, 5) (DDR), (5, 6) (L U/D), (6, 2) (DDD), (5, 3) (LDD).\n    *   Keeps me close to the center for subsequent movement south.\n\n*   **If I move RIGHT to (7, 8):**\n    *   Eats apple (7, 8).\n    *   Next potential targets: (6, 7) (1 move away, D), (7, 5) (DD), (9, 7) (R D R), (8, 7) (D).\n    *   Opens up movement towards the dense body segments on the right (8,y) and (9,y), which might be constricting, but also towards the (7, 5) and (9, 7) apples.\n\nLet's look at the subsequent move options from both positions to maximize future apple access and avoid trapping myself.\n\n**A) From (6, 7):**\nNext preferred target is (7, 5) (2 moves away) or (5, 6) (2 moves away).\nMove options: (5, 7) L (safe), (6, 6) D (safe), (7, 7) R (safe).\n(6, 6) leads directly to (6, 2) and (6, 0).\n\n**B) From (7, 8):**\nNext preferred target is (6, 7) (1 move away) or (7, 5) (2 moves away).\nMove options: (7, 7) D (safe, towards 7, 5), (6, 8) L (safe), (8, 8) R (into my body, deadly).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7, 8) gives me immediate access to (6, 7) next turn (if Snake 0 doesn't steal it, which is highly unlikely due to distance *and* the dense wall of body segments near (3, 7) and (1, 7) blocking it). This allows for a two-apple capture sequence (7, 8) -> (6, 7).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 7), the best move next turn is likely to (7, 7) or (6, 6). (7, 8) is still available but moving away from the south/center cluster.\n\nThe sequence (7, 8) -> (6, 7) allows me to capture two adjacent apples and then position myself well to move down the board center axis towards (7, 5), (6, 2), (5, 6), (5, 3). Since (6, 7) is currently blocked from Snake 0 by many body segments, capturing (7, 8) first seems strategically safer for ensuring multiple captures in sequence, securing the slightly more vulnerable apple (7, 8).\n\nPlan: Capture (7, 8) this turn, then (6, 7) next turn.\n\n**4. Final Decision:**\nMove RIGHT to (7, 8).\n\n--Short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns:--\nT34: Move RIGHT to (7, 8) to secure apple. T35: Move DOWN to (6, 7) to secure the next apple. Then head towards (7, 5) and move down towards (6, 2) or cut towards the middle (5, 6), (5, 3). Ensure continuous movement away from the thickest parts of my own body segment wall (8,y) and (9,y).\nRIGHT",

(8, 8) is in the way for R move.\n\nOkay, the only safe move is DOWN to (7, 7).\n\n3. Analyze Move DOWN to (7, 7):\n*   Destination (7, 7) is safe (empty space 'T').\n*   Future position: (7, 7).\n*   If I move DOWN, my tail (9, 2) *will* vacate since I ate an apple last turn, but I am not eating an apple this turn. The tail position will remain (9, 2).\n\nFrom (7, 7), where do I go next?\n*   Target (6, 7) is 1 move LEFT. Safe.\n*   Target (7, 5) is 2 moves DOWN. Safe.\n*   Target (9, 7) is 2 moves RIGHT. (8, 7) is in my body, so 2 moves right is still difficult.\n    *   (7, 7) -> (8, 7) [RIGHT] is deadly. (8, 7) is in my body.\n*   Target (8, 6) is 3 moves approx. (8, 6) is currently in my body. Wait, (8, 6) is currently in my body. I need to get away from this wall (8,y) and (9,y).\n\nThe immediate next priority is (6, 7). Moving DOWN to (7, 7) positions me perfectly for a LEFT move to (6, 7) next turn, capturing another apple.\n\nAlternative move evaluation: None, as UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are immediately fatal.\n\nFinal choice must be DOWN.\n\n**Short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns:**\nT35: Move DOWN to (7, 7).

This move is safe, gets me closer to the apple cluster, but places me adjacent to my long column at x=3 which slightly reduces right-side escape routes.\n- UP to (1,5): immediate options after that are RIGHT (to apple at 2,5) or UP (to 1,6). LEFT is blocked by my body at (0,5) and DOWN would be the neck. Moving UP keeps more room between my head and the long vertical body at x=3, and puts me directly in line to take (2,5) on the next turn while avoiding a cramped corridor next to my own body.\n\nNo enemy head is close enough to contest these nearby apples on the next turn, so the choice is mainly about preserving maneuvering room. Moving UP keeps two good follow-ups (RIGHT to (2,5) to eat the apple, or UP to gain vertical space) while steering me away from the x=3 column where my body is concentrated.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Take the nearby apple at (2,5) on the next turn (RIGHT from (1,5) if safe).\n- After that, prioritize apples at (4,5) and (4,3) while avoiding getting trapped against my own body column at x=3.\n- Keep distance from tight spaces along the left wall and the x=3 corridor; prefer routes that leave multiple exits.\n\nUP",

Evaluate potential moves from My Head (7, 7):\n\n*   **UP to (7, 8):** Into my body. Deadly. (7, 8) is the segment right behind the head.\n*   **DOWN to (7, 6):** Safe. Coordinates (7, 6) is empty space.\n*   **LEFT to (6, 7):** Target apple! This is a safe move and leads to an apple.\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 7):** Into my body. Deadly.\n\n2. Analyzing Safe Moves: DOWN to (7, 6) and LEFT to (6, 7).\n\nA. Move LEFT to (6, 7):\n*   Outcome: Eat apple at (6, 7). Grow. Score +1.\n*   Collision check: Enemy 0 is at (1, 5), too far to conflict.\n*   This is the optimal move based on the immediate goal.\n\nB. Move DOWN to (7, 6):\n*   Outcome: Safe move, moves towards (7, 5).\n*   Pro: Keeps options open.\n*   Con: Ignores an immediate apple capture.\n\n3. Enemy Consideration:\nEnemy 0 is at (1, 5). Possible next moves for E0: (0, 5), (2, 5) (apple!), (1, 6), (1, 4) (into tail). E0 is likely targeting (2, 5). E0 is far away and does not interfere with my move to (6, 7).\n\n4. Decision:\nThe move LEFT to (6, 7) is safe and captures an apple. This is the highest priority.\n\n5. Future Strategy:\nAfter capturing (6, 7), my head will be at (6, 7). I will look to move to (6, 6) or (5, 7) to target other nearby apples like (7, 5) (2 moves away), (5, 6) (1 move away), (5, 3) (3 moves away), or clearing the way toward (6, 2) or (5, 2). Moving to (5, 6) next turn seems very appealing.\n\nShort long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns:\nT36: Move LEFT to (6, 7) to capture an apple. T37: Move to (5, 7) or (6, 6). (5, 6) is another excellent target 2 moves away. I need to be careful with the body segments around (7, 5) and (8, 5) as I consolidate.\nLEFT",

No enemy head is near (2,5), so head-on collision is unlikely.\n- UP to (1,6) keeps me alive but is more constraining: from (1,6) the only good forward option is RIGHT to (2,6). UP is into my body at (1,7), LEFT is blocked, DOWN is the neck \u2014 so moving UP would leave me with essentially one follow-up, reducing flexibility.\n- Taking the apple now is both safe and furthers the objective of collecting apples before opponents can reach nearby apple clusters.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Take (2,5) now.

Since the board state shows E0's head at (2, 5), and the apple list doesn't include (2, 5), it means E0 ate the apple last turn, if it moved to (2, 5). Wait, let's re-read the provided E0 head location and score. E0 Head: (2, 5). The scores indicate E0 has 19 apples. If E0 moved to (2, 5) this turn, it would have eaten an apple *if* an apple existed there. The apple list provided is for Turn 37, *before* I move.\n\nLet's check the board state at (2, 5): '0' (Enemy 0's head). This means E0 moved *to* (2, 5) on the previous turn (T36). If there was an apple there, E0 ate it. The apple list provided for Turn 37 (current turn) does not list (2, 5). Thus, E0 just ate an apple and is 19 segments long.\n\n1. Evaluate potential moves from My Head (6, 7):\n*   **UP to (6, 8):** Into my body. Deadly. (6, 8) is the third segment of my body.\n*   **DOWN to (6, 6):** Safe. Empty space. Moves toward apples (7, 5), (5, 6), (6, 2).\n*   **LEFT to (5, 7):** Safe. Empty space. Moves toward apple (5, 6).\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 7):** Into my body. Deadly. (7, 7) is the segment right behind the head.\n\n2. Analyzing Safe Moves: DOWN to (6, 6) and LEFT to (5, 7).\n\nA. Move LEFT to (5, 7):\n*   Distance to (5, 6) is 1 move.\n*   Distance to (7, 5) is 3 moves (5, 7 -> 5, 6 -> 6, 6 -> 7, 6 or similar).\n*   (5, 7) is an open space.\n\nB. Move DOWN to (6, 6):\n*   Distance to (5, 6) is 1 move (via 5, 6).\n*   Distance to (7, 5) is 2 moves (via 7, 6).\n*   (6, 6) is an open space.\n\n3. Comparing targets and path safety:\nApples nearby: (7, 5), (5, 6), (2, 7), (6, 2).\n\n*   Target (5, 6):\n    *   From (6, 7) -> LEFT to (5, 7). Next turn (T38): DOWN to (5, 6) (eat apple). Total 2 turns.\n    *   From (6, 7) -> DOWN to (6, 6). Next turn (T38): LEFT to (5, 6) (eat apple). Total 2 turns.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN reach (5, 6) in 2 turns.\n\n*   Target (7, 5):\n    *   If I go LEFT to (5, 7): (5, 7) -> (6, 7-EAT!) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 5-EAT!). This is complicated by the body around (7, 7) and (8, 7).\n    *   If I go DOWN to (6, 6): (6, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 5-EAT!). 3 turns total. (6, 7) -> (6, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 5).\n\nSince I am seeking the most direct path to an apple, (5, 6) is a high priority.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 6):\nT37: Head at (6, 6). Tail vacates (9, 3).\nT38: Move LEFT to (5, 6) (eat apple).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 7):\nT37: Head at (5, 7). Tail vacates (9, 3).\nT38: Move DOWN to (5, 6) (eat apple).\n\n4. Evaluating future stability and constraints:\n\nMy body runs along the north/east edge: (7, 7), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), ...\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 7), I will be close to my body segments (5, 8) and (5, 9).\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 6), I am moving away from the wall of my body.\n\nThe move DOWN to (6, 6) seems slightly better for maneuverability as it avoids boxing myself in against the (5, 8) segment. It also positions me nicely to pivot south/east toward the cluster of apples down there (6, 2), (5, 2), (7, 2).\n\n5. Enemy 0 collision check:\nEnemy 0 is at (2, 5). E0 may move UP to (2, 6), DOWN to (2, 4), LEFT to (1, 5) (into body), RIGHT to (3, 5) (into body).\nE0's safe moves are (2, 6) and (2, 4).\nIf E0 moves (2, 6): Head is far away.\nIf E0 moves (2, 4): Head is far away.\nNo collision risk.\n\nDecision: Move DOWN to (6, 6). This sets up an easy apple capture at (5, 6) next turn and maintains good central board position.\n\nShort long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns:\nT37: Move DOWN to (6, 6). T38: Move LEFT to (5, 6) and eat apple. T39 onwards: Look towards (7, 5) or the south cluster (6, 2), (5, 2).\nDOWN",

That risks getting boxed in.\n- UP to (2,6) is legal and gives at least two reasonable follow-ups: UP to (2,7) (there is an apple at (2,7) to claim next turn) or LEFT to (1,6) to keep space. RIGHT from (2,6) is blocked by my body at (3,6). Enemy head (6,7) is far enough that a head-on collision at (2,6)/(2,7) is very unlikely this turn.\n\nShort plan:\n- Move to (2,6) now, then take the apple at (2,7) on the following turn. After that, head toward the cluster around (4,5)/(4,3) while keeping paths that maintain at least two exits and avoiding being trapped along the x=3 column.\n\nUP",

Move LEFT to (5, 6):\n*   I capture an apple. My length increases to 19.\n*   Next turn, I will be at (5, 6).\n*   This is the preferred move.\n\nB. Move DOWN to (6, 5):\n*   Empty space. Moves me south.\n\nC. Move RIGHT to (7, 6):\n*   Empty space. Moves me toward (7, 5) apple, but (7, 6) is close to my body segments (7, 7), (8, 6).\n\n3. Enemy 0 collision check:\nE0 is at (2, 6). Possible moves:\n*   UP to (2, 7) (Eats apple)\n*   DOWN to (2, 5) (Into body segment right behind head. Deadly.)\n*   LEFT to (1, 6) (Safe)\n*   RIGHT to (3, 6) (Into body segment. Deadly.)\n\nE0 will likely move UP to (2, 7) for the apple. (2, 6) -> (2, 7). This is far from my position (6, 6). No collision risk.\n\n4. Decision: The move LEFT to (5, 6) captures an apple immediately, increasing my score to 18 and length to 19.\n\n5. Future Path considerations after LEFT (to (5, 6)):\nI will be at (5, 6).\nNearby apples: (7, 5) (distance 3), (5, 3) (distance 3), (4, 5) (distance 1).\nIf I move LEFT, I can then go LEFT to (4, 6) and then DOWN to (4, 5) (eat apple, total 2 moves after current move).\nOr I can go DOWN to (5, 5) and then DOWN to (5, 4) and then to (5, 3) (eat apple, total 3 moves after current move).\n\nThe path is clear and beneficial.\n\nShort long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns:\nT38: Move LEFT to (5, 6) and eat apple. T39: From (5, 6), target (4, 5) by moving LEFT to (4, 6) or DOWN to (5, 5) and then adjust towards (4, 5) or (5, 3). Given the board layout, (4, 5) seems an easier immediate follow-up.\n\nLEFT",

Let's rely on the head position change (2, 6) -> (2, 7) and the score increase (19 -> 20) and length increase (20 -> 21) from the previous turn's analysis (the rationale states E0 was at 19 apples before T38, and now it is 20, confirming the apple was eaten). *Self-correction: The board depiction shows `A` at (2, 7), but the apple list provided for T39 does NOT list (2, 7).*\n**Apple List for T39:** (7, 5), (9, 7), (6, 2), (4, 5), (5, 3), (4, 0), (6, 0), (2, 0), (4, 3), (0, 1), (5, 2), (5, 0), (7, 2), (2, 3), (9, 6).\n*Wait, the provided board state for T39 shows 'A' at (9, 7), (9, 6), (7, 5), (4, 5), (5, 3), (4, 3), (2, 3), (5, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (0, 1), (2, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0).*\n*Wait again, the apples listed in the text are:* (7, 5), (9, 7), (6, 2), (4, 5), (5, 3), (4, 0), (6, 0), (2, 0), (4, 3), (0, 1), (5, 2), (5, 0), (7, 2), (2, 3), (9, 6).\nThese 15 apples seem consistent with the board map and are the targets.\n\nMy Head is at (5, 6).\n\n1.

Evaluating safe moves towards (4, 5):\n*   **LEFT to (4, 6):** Distance to (4, 5) becomes 1 (DOWN). Excellent move.\n*   **DOWN to (5, 5):** Distance to (4, 5) becomes 1 (LEFT). Excellent move.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN position me well for the apple at (4, 5).\n\n4. Enemy 0 (E0) at (2, 7) analysis:\nE0 is long (21 segments).\nPossible moves for E0:\n*   UP to (2, 8): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (2, 6): Into E0's body segment (2, 6). Deadly.\n*   LEFT to (1, 7): Safe, but close to its body segments (1, 8), (1, 9).\n*   RIGHT to (3, 7): Into E0's body segment (3, 7). Deadly.\n\nE0's only truly safe moves are UP (2, 8) and LEFT (1, 7). E0 is currently blocked from further movement to the South/East easily. E0 is far away from me (distance 5+1 = 6).\n\nIf E0 goes UP to (2, 8), it moves away from me, and closer to its trapped tail area.\nIf E0 goes LEFT to (1, 7), it also moves away from me, and closer to its long body segment (0, 7) and (1, 8).\n\nThere are no immediate head-on collision risks.\n\n5. Choosing between LEFT (4, 6) and DOWN (5, 5):\n\nBouncing off my own long tail, which wraps around the right side of the board, is a growing concern.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 6):\nNext move options: UP (4, 7), DOWN (4, 5) [EAT APPLE], LEFT (3, 6). All safe based on current board state except potential blockages from E0 or walls. (4, 5) is open (A). (3, 6) is an open T. (4, 7) is open. This path seems good.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 5):\nNext move options: UP (5, 6) [Into own body segment (6, 6) if no apple eaten], DOWN (5, 4), LEFT (4, 5) [EAT APPLE], RIGHT (6, 5). (4, 5) is open (A). (5, 4) is open. (6, 5) is open. This path also seems good.\n\nLet's look further ahead.\n(4, 5) is priority.\n\nIf I go LEFT (4, 6) -> DOWN (4, 5) [EAT]. I am now at (4, 5), length 20.\nNext apple targets: (5, 3) (distance 2), (4, 3) (distance 2).\nFrom (4, 5): UP (4, 6), DOWN (4, 4), LEFT (3, 5), RIGHT (5, 5). All safe. (4, 4) is blocked by T0's path, (3, 5) is open, (5, 5) is open.\n\nIf I go DOWN (5, 5) -> LEFT (4, 5) [EAT]. I am now at (4, 5), length 20. Same position, same future options.\n\nSince (5, 6) is central, moving LEFT (to (4, 6)) keeps me closer to x=4/3 line where there are many apples: (4, 5), (4, 3), (4, 0), (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 0).\nMoving LEFT prioritizes navigating the lower-left/center area.\n\nI will choose LEFT to target (4, 5).\n\nShort long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns:\nT39: Move LEFT to (4, 6). T40: Move DOWN to (4, 5) to eat the apple. Then prioritize apples (4, 3) and (5, 3) in the center-bottom region. E0 is busy on the far left/top.\n\nLEFT",

I did not eat an apple last turn, so my tail (9, 5) will move to the body location (8, 5).\n\nEnemy Snake 0 (E0):\nHead: (2, 8)\nBody: [(2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9), (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5)]\nLength: 21. E0 did not eat an apple last turn, so its tail (3, 5) will move to the body segment (3, 6). E0 moved from (2, 7) to (2, 8) (UP).\n\nApples at: (7, 5), (9, 7), (6, 2), (4, 5), (5, 3), (4, 0), (6, 0), (2, 0), (4, 3), (0, 1), (5, 2), (5, 0), (7, 2), (2, 3), (9, 6)\n\nMy current head position is (4, 6).\n\n1. Evaluate potential moves from My Head (4, 6):\n*   **UP to (4, 7):** Safe. Empty space.\n*   **DOWN to (4, 5):** Safe. Apple! (EAT)\n*   **LEFT to (3, 6):** Safe. Empty space.\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 6):** Into my body segment (segment right behind head). Deadly. (My body starts at (5, 6)).\n\nSafe Moves: UP (4, 7), DOWN (4, 5) [EAT apple], LEFT (3, 6).\n\n2. Prioritize:\nThe closest apple is at (4, 5). Moving DOWN is an immediate kill move, which is extremely desirable, especially since E0 is ahead in score (20 vs 18).\n\n3. Collision Analysis:\nMy target is (4, 5).\nE0's head is at (2, 8). E0 is far away and won't reach (4, 5) this turn. The distance is 4 (2 in X, 3 in Y). Any move E0 makes will keep it far.\n\n4. Choosing the move:\nMoving DOWN to (4, 5) is the best choice as it secures an apple, increases my lead potential, and maintains safe positioning.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 5) [EAT]:\nMy length becomes 20. My new tail remains at (9, 5) because I ate an apple.\nNew Head: (4, 5).\n\n5. Short long-term plan:\nAfter eating the apple at (4, 5), I will be at (4, 5). Closest apples are:\n(5, 3): Distance 1 (X) + 2 (Y) = 3\n(4, 3): Distance 2 (Y) = 2\n(7, 5): Distance 3 (X) = 3\n(5, 2): Distance 1 (X) + 3 (Y) = 4\n\nThe apple at (4, 3) is the closest. From (4, 5), I can move DOWN to (4, 4) or (4, 3). (4, 4) is currently empty space. (4, 3) is an apple.\nThe path to (4, 3) via DOWN, DOWN is straightforward.\n\nPlan: T40: DOWN to (4, 5). T41: DOWN to (4, 4). T42: DOWN to (4, 3) [EAT]. Then target (5, 3) or (5, 2).\n\nDOWN",
