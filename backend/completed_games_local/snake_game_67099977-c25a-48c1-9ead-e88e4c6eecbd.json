No collision risk.  \n**Plan note:** t18: RIGHT (5,9). t19: RIGHT (6,9). t20: RIGHT (7,9). t21: RIGHT (8,9). t22: RIGHT (9,9). t23: DOWN (9,8). t24: DOWN (9,7)\u2014but check enemy (if they head east post-(7,5), at t23 pivot LEFT (8,9) then DOWN col8 to avoid; if clear, continue to (9,0) eat7 t27, len8, then west row0 to (4,0) eat8 t30, (0,0) eat9 t34). If enemy chases south to (4,0), I block by taking first or loop north/center. Maintain lead, evade body trails (col4 clears by t21). If enemy errs (e.g. into own body chasing (7,5)), win early.  \nRIGHT",

Prefer UP: direct to (0,3) apple next (t35 eat to 11, grow len12, tail stays (4,4) as (0,3) empty now), secures col0 apple before enemy detours (enemy blocked by my col4 wall at row1-5, needs UP/DOWN then LEFTs, ~4-6 turns to col0 row3 vs my 1 turn). RIGHT to (1,1) viable alt (then UP (1,2) empty for path to (1,4) apple), but slower/looser to (0,3); risks apple spawn/competition if enemy breaks left soon (e.g., DOWN t34 (5,1)-LEFT t35 (4,1) but my (4,1) still occupied t35 unless I grow multiple, no). Enemy likely stalls UP/DOWN to circle right apples or avoid trap; if DOWN t34 (5,1), t35 could LEFT toward (2,2) via row1 detour but hits my (4,1)/(3,1 empty? but chain risk).

Monitor enemy: if UP chain to row4+ for (3,4), intercept at (1,4); if DOWN/LEFT toward (2,2), post-eat go RIGHT (1,3)-RIGHT (2,3 empty)-DOWN (2,2) eat/block. Ignore (9,9) still.

Avoid (9,9) until endgame trap.  \n**Plan note:** t50 DOWN (7,1) eat 15; t51 RIGHT (8,1); t52 UP (8,2) eat 16; then if clear t53 UP (8,3), t54 UP (8,4) eat 18, adjust south; else t53 RIGHT (9,2), t54 DOWN (9,1), t55 DOWN (9,0) eat 17. Adapt enemy south push, block west.  \nDOWN",

Enemy body cols8-9 rows4-9 blocks south push, reinforces plan safety.  \n**Plan note:** t66 UP (0,2); t67 UP eat (0,3) (18,grow19) head(0,3); t68 RIGHT (1,3); t69 RIGHT (2,3); t70 RIGHT (3,3); t71 RIGHT (4,3); t72 RIGHT eat (5,3) (19,grow20) head(5,3). Row3 cols1-5 empty/safe. Tail by t72 frees row0 col5+ / row2 col9, no path blocks. Post-t72: UP to (5,4)t73, UP (5,5)t74, UP (5,6)t75, LEFT eat (4,6)A t76 (20,grow21) if row4-6 cols4-5 clear (currently empty, row4 col4 ., row5 col4-5 . T? row5 col8-9 T enemy, but cols4-5 free; monitor enemy post-(2,8) moves NW or S? bias north). If enemy south to row6 col4 risk, pivot LEFT from (5,3) to (4,3)t73 then UP/DOWN adapt to (1,4)A or evade col0 west. Prioritize (4,6) for +1 lead (21-15/16), then north (2,8) if remains or south (1,4) secured.  \nUP",

UP accelerates 2-apple path (t67/t72), maintains options post-(5,3): immediate UP eat (5,4)A t73 (+1 to 20, grow20) as row4-5 cols5 empty; then UP (5,5)t74, UP to (5,6)t75, LEFT to (4,6)A t76 (+1 to 21) if cols4-5 row6 clear (currently .

Enemy if DOWN t70 (2,6), continues south to (1,2) t73-74 (via left/down), misses my chain (can't reach cols4+ rows3-6 in 4-5 turns blocked by path length ~7+); if RIGHT t70 (3,7), heads east but top row9 body slows pivot south (min 6+ turns to (4,6), I already eat t78). UP/LEFT suboptimal: UP north wastes turns (to (4,6) ~5 turns zig-zag vs 4 straight), risks enemy south uncontested; LEFT traps west near my bottom body, ignores chain (+0 vs +4). RIGHT maximizes eats (+4 net this phase), maintains lead/extension (23 vs enemy max +1=16), keeps options (post-chain head (4,6) open north/east/south block). No collision risks (dist enemy head 3+, simultaneous move no overlap). Tail post-no-eat t70 shrinks from (7,1), frees space irrelevant.  \n**Plan note:** t70 RIGHT (2,4); t71 RIGHT (3,4); t72 RIGHT (4,4); t73 DOWN eat (4,3) (20,g21) (4,3); t74 RIGHT eat (5,3) (21,g22) (5,3); t75 UP eat (5,4) (22,g23) (5,4); t76 UP (5,5); t77 LEFT (4,5); t78 UP eat (4,6) (23,g24) (4,6). Post-t78: 23 apples, monitor enemy position (if south to (1,2) eat t74ish, lead 23-16=7; if east/south chase, block at (5,6) RIGHT or (3,6) LEFT; avoid col8-9 enemy tail). If enemy deviates RIGHT t70+ to center, adapt t76 DOWN block (5,4) hold or LEFT loop row5. Goal: secure 23+ by t80, expand mid-board, force enemy edge play for 25-30 total by t100.  \nRIGHT",

Net +3 vs enemy +1, lead to 7; dominates mid-board. If enemy skips (4,6) (unlikely, greedy), still gain +3 uncontested, then pursue (4,6) later. UP wastes chain (+0 immediate, reaches (4,6) t75 vs enemy t72); DOWN suboptimal (+1-2 short-term, abandons east apples, tightens west space). RIGHT maximizes score/safety, preserves options (post-t75 at (5,4): east row4 col6-9 empty for expansion, north row5+ open to block enemy).  \n**Plan note:** t72 R (4,4); t73 D eat (4,3) (20,g21); t74 R eat (5,3) (21,g22); t75 U eat (5,4) (22,g23).

Monitor (4,6): if uneaten post-t75, loop back t77-78 via U (5,5)t76 - R? Wait no, post-R t76 at (6,4): pivot west? Better U t76 (5,5), t77 L (4,5) empty, t78 U (4,6) if available +23.

Safe, but leads toward congested bottom rows (row 0 fully occupied by own tail, row 1 mostly open but dead-ends east at (9,1) own tail). Limits north access; nearby apples (1,2)/(2,2) inaccessible without backtracking dangerously. Poor for expansion.  \n- **LEFT** to (4,2): Directly into own body (immediate backward collision). Suicide.  \n- **RIGHT** to (6,2): Empty (row 2, col 6 is .). Safe. Opens path north: (6,3) empty, (6,4) empty, toward (3,5) apple (dist ~3-4, via left at row 5). Avoids self-trap, maintains lead by probing uncontested center-north while enemy likely eats (7,7) left (head to (7,7), growing to 18). No head-on risk (enemy far east, unlikely to contest col 6 soon).  \n\nOnly two safes; RIGHT prioritizes apple access (3,5) and open space (cols 6-9 rows 2-5 mostly free of both snakes), keeping 3+ follow-ups open (up/right/down from (6,2)). DOWN risks isolation in south, wasting turns on no apples.\n\n### Enemy Prediction\nEnemy head (8,7) adjacent to apple (7,7) left\u2014high chance LEFT to eat (+1 to 18), vacating (8,7). Post-eat, they'll likely probe south (8,6 empty) or east (9,7 empty), but our RIGHT path skirts their east flank without collision. If they go UP/DOWN/ RIGHT instead, (7,7) stays for us later (dist ~8 post-RIGHT, feasible by t83-85 via row 5 east then north).\n\n### Strategy Note for Next Turns\nt78 RIGHT (6,2)e no-eat, tail lags at (9,1); t79 UP (6,3)e; t80 UP (6,4)e; t81 LEFT (5,4)?

Assume growth: path to (3,5) via t80 LEFT from (6,3)? Adjust: t79 RIGHT (7,2)e row2 col7 .; safer north loop. Then t80 UP (7,3)e row3 col7 .; t81 UP (7,4)e; t82 LEFT (6,5)e row5 col6 . toward (3,5) dist2; t83 LEFT (5,5)e; t84 LEFT (4,5)e; t85 LEFT (3,5)+24. Blocks enemy east if they south post-eat. If enemy skips (7,7), we can detour east t82+ to claim it (~dist 5 from t81). Prioritize (3,5) for +24 lead to 7; then (0,7) long north-west via col0 row7 open. Avoid south entirely; contain enemy in col8+ rows6-9. Monitor for enemy DOWN to (8,6)e\u2014adapt t82 RIGHT to (8,4)e intercept if needed.

Positions head centrally in col 6, aligning with clear up-path to row 5 (all col 6 rows 3-5 empty), enabling direct access to (3, 5) apple if prioritized, or pivot right to (7, 4) then (8, 4). Multiple follow-ups: up, right (both empty).  \n- **DOWN** to (6, 1): Empty (row 1, col 6 is .). Safe short-term, allows left along row 1 to eat (1, 2) and (2, 2) (+2 by t86 to 25), but traps snake in southern pocket (row 1 ~9 cells + row 2 col 1-3 + row 3 col 2-3 ~12 free cells total). Length 25 exceeds space; body blocks north exits (row 4 col 2-5 T), leading to fill-up and death ~t90-95 despite no immediate collision. Violates keeping options open; isolates from northern apples and risks enemy claiming (8, 4)/(3, 5).  \n- **LEFT** to (5, 2): Own body (immediate segment). Suicide.  \n- **RIGHT** to (7, 2): Empty (row 2, col 7 is .). Safe. Opens east row 2, but slightly detour for northern path vs. UP's direct col 6 alignment. Follow-ups: up/right/down all empty.  \n\nSafe: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. DOWN eliminated for trapping/death risk. Between UP/RIGHT, both reach (8, 4) eat (+24) by t82 (UP-UP-R-R or R-UP-UP-R sequences, 4 moves, clear path). UP preferred: central col 6 offers branch to (3, 5) in 6 moves (UP-UP-UP-L-L-L to t84 eat alt path) if enemy nears (8, 4); RIGHT commits east sooner, fewer branches. Prioritizes apple proximity (8, 4 dist 4 manhattan) and open north-center space (rows 3-5 col 6-9 mostly free).\n\n### Enemy Prediction\nHead (7, 7), safes: UP (7, 8) empty or LEFT (6, 7) empty; DOWN/RIGHT own body suicide. No adjacent apple; likely LEFT probing west/center (toward (3, 5) dist ~4 but own body blocks south), gaining ~1-2 cells/turn toward us. UP keeps north. Unlikely to contest (8, 4) (dist 4 but down blocked, requires ~6+ turns detour) or (3, 5) soon (own row 7 col 1-4 T chokes left). (0, 7) A blocked for enemy (cannot bypass own body west/north; alt east-south loop ~20+ turns). South apples (1, 2)/(2, 2) too far (~15+ turns via center), likely uneaten.\n\n### Strategy Note for Next Turns\nt79 UP (6, 3) no-eat (tail removes (9, 0), new tail (8, 0)); t80 UP (6, 4) no; t81 RIGHT (7, 4) no; t82 RIGHT (8, 4) eat +24 (grow to 25, tail static).

(row 6 col 8 T? row6 col8 T enemy, but not immediate). No collision risk.  \n- **DOWN** to (8, 3): Empty (row 3 col 8 .). Safe but suboptimal. Heads south into own body-dense area (row 3 col 7-4 partial congestion); follow-ups limited (LEFT own (7, 3) T, RIGHT (9, 3) ., DOWN (8, 2) . but traps momentum). Detour to (3, 5) ~7 turns via loops; risks self-entrapment as tail shifts south. Avoid.  \n- **LEFT** to (7, 4): Own body. Suicide.  \n- **RIGHT** to (9, 4): Empty (row 4 col 9 .). Safe, but edges board; follow-ups UP (9, 5) ., DOWN (9, 3) ., LEFT back to (8, 4) vacated but own trail. Delays apples (to (3, 5) ~7 turns looping south/west); exposes east flank unnecessarily. No apple gain.  \n\nSafe: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. UP optimal: progresses to (3, 5) efficiently, preserves lead (24 vs 18), keeps options open west/north. RIGHT exploratory but wasteful; DOWN risky congestion.\n\n### Enemy Prediction\nHead (4, 8): Only safe move UP to (4, 9) . (DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT into own body). Post-move, enemy in row 9 col 4; likely RIGHT (5, 9) . or LEFT (3, 9) T? Tail at (3, 9) shifts away.

Post-eat (0,7) t89: Grows (length 20, tail holds (3,7)); next likely DOWN (0,6) t90 (UP (0,8) traps next turn: no safe follow-up). Then continue DOWN col0 t91 (0,5), t92 (0,4), etc., targeting south apples (safe open path, no self-collision). My LEFT path intersects at (0,5) t91: head-on (both die, I win 25-19). If enemy detours (e.g., t91 RIGHT (1,6) from (0,6)), no collision\u2014my path clear, I eat (1,2) t95 before enemy navigates my body blocks (e.g., can't DOWN col1/2 early: (1,4)/(2,4) occupied until t95/t96). Low risk of enemy taking south first.\n\n### Strategy Note for Next Turns\nt89 LEFT (2,5); t90 LEFT (1,5); t91 LEFT (0,5) [collide/win if enemy down col0, else safe]; t92 DOWN (0,4); t93 DOWN (0,3); t94 DOWN (0,2); t95 RIGHT (1,2) eat +26 (grow, tail holds at whatever freed). Post-eat: From (1,2), DOWN (1,1) A t96 +27 or RIGHT (2,2) A t96 +27 [check clearance]; avoid enemy remnant if survives. Then loop east for (6,8) A if board opens (row8 col6 via row5/6 post-tail shift, ~t100). Maintain 7+ lead; collision preferred for immediate win, else clear south for 27-19+.\n\nLEFT",

Safe; opens north path toward (6,8) A, but delays south (3-4 apples closer, risks enemy uncontested grab). Follow-ups: LEFT/RIGHT along row6 clear short-term, but traps if enemy blocks col0/2.  \n- **DOWN** to (2,4): Own body (2,4). Suicide.  \n- **LEFT** to (1,5): Empty (row5 col1 .). Safe; continues south-west path per plan, positions for col0 down to (1,2) A t95 (+26). No immediate body overlap; tail frees col0 progressively (e.g., (0,3) viable t93 as snake shifts).  \n- **RIGHT** to (3,5): Own body (3,5). Suicide.  \n\nSafe: UP/LEFT. Prefer LEFT: Secures south apples faster (distance ~5 vs. UP's detour ~8+), maintains lead (25-19), avoids north where enemy (0,7) could contest (6,8) A. UP risks enemy DOWN col0 sweep, claiming (1,2)/(1,1) before I loop back.\n\n### Enemy Prediction\nHead (0,7): LEFT off-board suicide; RIGHT own body (1,7); UP (0,8) . (north, away from apples\u2014low incentive, dead-ends vs. own body row8/9); DOWN (0,6) . (optimal: open col0 south to apples, no self-hit).

If detours RIGHT t91 (1,6) ., delays its south by 2-3 turns; can't bypass my tail blocks early (e.g., (1,3)/(1,4) occupied til t94).

Safe; heads north toward (6,8) A (dist ~7), but risks enemy RIGHT collision (both to (1,6)\u2014head-on death, but 25>19 wins game). Leaves south apples (1,2/1,1/2,2/4,0) vulnerable if enemy DOWNs uncontested. Follow-ups: UP further to row7 col1 T (enemy body)\u2014blocked; RIGHT/LEFT lateral but tight with enemy head nearby.  \n- **DOWN** to (1,4): Own body (1,4). Suicide.  \n- **LEFT** to (0,5): Empty (row5 col0 .). Safe; advances south-west per plan, positions for col0 descent to (1,2) A by t95 (+26). No self-hit; tail at (0,1) freeing downward progressively (e.g., (0,4)/(0,3) clear soon). Potential enemy DOWN collision to (0,5)\u2014mutual death, but 25>19 wins immediately.  \n- **RIGHT** to (2,5): Own body (2,5). Suicide.  \n\nSafe: UP/LEFT. Prefer LEFT: Secures 3-4 south apples uncontested (total dist ~6 vs. UP's north detour ~10+), widens lead to 28-29 before north. Enemy can't block col0 fast (its body loops east/north); if collision, instant win. UP risks enemy claiming south while I detour, narrowing lead.\n\n### Enemy Prediction\nHead (0,6): UP own body (0,7); LEFT off-board; RIGHT (1,6) . (east detour, delays south by 2+ turns, low incentive vs. apples south); DOWN (0,5) . (optimal: direct col0 south to (1,2)/(1,1) A, ~3-4 turns). Likely DOWN t91 (0,5)\u2014collision if I LEFT (win via apples); if RIGHT t91 (1,6), my LEFT clear, enemy delayed (reaches (1,2) t94+ vs. my t95 eat). No way for enemy to steal south before me; north (6,8) A safe for later.\n\n### Strategy Note for Next Turns\nt91 LEFT (0,5) [collide/win if enemy DOWN, else safe]; t92 DOWN (0,4) [empty, tail shifts clear]; t93 DOWN (0,3) [tail (0,3) frees as head moves]; t94 DOWN (0,2) [empty]; t95 RIGHT (1,2) eat +26. Post-eat head (1,2): t96 RIGHT (2,2) A +27 (greedy double-eat, clears path to (1,1)); alt t96 DOWN (1,1) A +27 if (2,2) risky. Then t97 RIGHT/DOWN to (4,0) A ~t99 +28 (row0/1 east clear post-tail). Secure south fully (~t100: 28-19+ lead), then loop north via row0 east to (6,8) A t105+ if open. If collision win now, done; else force enemy trap/death in east/north. Monitor enemy post-south: if alive, bait col0/1 collision.\n\nLEFT",

It keeps me on the left edge, maintaining distance from the enemy and preserving multiple future options, such as moving RIGHT later toward apples at (1,2) or (1,1) if the path clears. This avoids immediate threats while positioning for potential apple collection.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**  \nContinue monitoring the enemy at (1,5); if they move away, attempt to reach (1,2) or (1,1) via RIGHT and DOWN; if blocked, use the left edge to loop around toward (6,8) or (4,0) via safer paths, prioritizing survival and open spaces. **END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",
