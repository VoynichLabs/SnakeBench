(8, 7) - Distance: 3 units (1 right, 2 up OR 2 up, 1 right).\n2. (3, 6) - Distance: 5 units (4 left, 1 up).\n3. (3, 3) - Distance: 6 units (4 left, 2 down).\n4.

Moving towards it immediately is the most efficient opening strategy.\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\nHead towards the apple at (8, 7). After that, evaluate the positions of the remaining apples, specifically (4, 8) and (3, 6), while monitoring Snake #1's movement.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nTargeting the nearest apple at (8, 7).

However, Snake #1 is at (8, 8). If Snake #1 moves DOWN to (8, 7) this turn, they will consume it. If I move UP to (8, 6), I will be directly below them.\n- If I move UP to (8, 6) and they move DOWN to (8, 7), they grow and I am at risk of a head-on collision on the following turn if I continue UP.\n- Apple at (8, 1) is relatively safe and far from the enemy.\n- The middle/left part of the board has three apples.\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\nMove UP to take the apple at (8, 7) if Snake #1 doesn't take it first. If Snake #1 moves to (8, 7), I will pivot toward the other apples. Given the turn count and positions, getting on the same column as the enemy allows for potential blocking, but capturing (8, 7) is the immediate priority.\n\nUP",

Moves away from Snake #1 and toward the cluster of apples at (3, 6) and (4, 8).\n4. **RIGHT (9, 6):** Safe move. Moves away from Snake #1, but closer to the edge.\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (8, 7). They are likely to move toward an apple. The closest apple to them is at (4, 8) or (9, 9). If they move DOWN to (8, 6), we collide. Since they just ate an apple and have a tail at (8, 8), they are currently length 2. I have no body segments (length 1).\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nMoving LEFT is the best option. It avoids a potential head-on collision at (8, 7) and (8, 6) if the opponent moves down. It positions me to contest the apples in the center-left of the board (3, 6) or (4, 8) while maintaining distance from the larger snake. \n\n**Plan for future turns:**\nTransition to the middle of the board to collect apples (3, 6) and (4, 8).

It increases the distance from Snake #1 and moves me directly towards the apple at (3, 6). Snake #1 is likely targeting (4, 8) or (3, 6) themselves. By moving LEFT, I contest the middle more effectively.\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\nCollect apple at (3, 6). Monitor Snake #1's movement; since they have a body segment, they are less maneuverable than me but have a slight advantage in head-on threats.

Moves closer to (4, 8) and (3, 6). However, it puts me adjacent to Snake #1's body at (7, 7).\n2. **DOWN (6, 5):** Safe move. Moves towards (3, 3) and (8, 1).\n3. **LEFT (5, 6):** Safe move. Directly towards apple at (3, 6).\n4. **RIGHT (7, 6):** Safe move, but moves me back toward the enemy snake's tail/body area.\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\nSnake #1 is at (7, 8). Their body segment is at (7, 7).\nSnake #1's possible moves:\n- UP to (7, 9)\n- DOWN to (7, 7) - Blocked by their own body.\n- LEFT to (6, 8)\n- RIGHT to (8, 8)\n\nSnake #1 is currently two units away vertically and one unit away horizontally. My move to (5, 6) or (6, 5) keeps a healthy distance from their head.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nThe apple at (3, 6) is the closest and most logical target. It is located at x=3, and I am currently at x=6. Moving LEFT brings me to (5, 6), exactly two tiles away from the apple. Snake #1 is at x=7 and likely targeting (4, 8) or (9, 9) or attempting to cut me off. By moving LEFT, I secure a path to (3, 6) and (3, 3).\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\nCollect apple at (3, 6), then evaluate the distance to (3, 3) or (4, 8). Maintain distance from Snake #1, as they have a body segment and can use it to wall me off if I get too close to the top-right quadrant.\n\nLEFT",

It also moves me closer to Snake #1.\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (5, 7). They are most likely targeting the apples at (5, 4) or (6, 3), or perhaps moving towards (9, 9).

This move takes me further from Snake #1 and puts me just two steps away from the apple at (8, 1).\n3. **RIGHT (8, 3):** SAFE.

They are currently positioned between me and the top-right cluster.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nI have 3 apples, and Snake #1 has 3 apples.

Snake #1 would have to travel through the center or around me to get it.\n- RIGHT (8, 3) is slightly better than DOWN because it preserves my ability to move UP the 8th or 9th column later if Snake #1 moves away from the top-right cluster, while still being only two moves away from (8, 1).\n\n**Plan:**\nMove toward (8, 1) to secure a lead.

This is my own body (the segment directly behind my head).\n\n**Snake #1 Analysis:**\nSnake #1 is at (6, 6). They have several apples nearby: (6, 8) is their closest target.

Since Snake #1 is already \"above\" me, it is safer and more efficient to grab the guaranteed point at (8, 1) first, then travel up the right wall (X=9) to pick up the leftovers in the top-right corner.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (8, 2) and then to (8, 1) to collect the apple.

Snake #1 is only 1-2 steps away from those same apples.\n\nAttempting to race Snake #1 for the top-right cluster is risky, but staying on the X=9 column (the edge) is my safest path to maneuver. Moving UP allows me to either contest any apples they miss or pivot toward the center-left apples (1, 6) and (3, 6) once my tail clears the middle of the board. \n\nSince UP is my only viable \"productive\" move that doesn't immediately trap me or waste time in a corner, it is the best choice.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (9, 2). Continue moving UP the right wall to see how Snake #1 reacts to the apple cluster. If Snake #1 occupies the top-right corner, I will look for an opening to cross back toward the middle (Y=4 or Y=5) to grab the apples at (3, 6) and (1, 6).\n\nUP",

Body: [(9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1)].\n- Snake #1 Head: (9, 9). Body: [(9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)].\n- Apple locations: (1, 6), (3, 6), (0, 4), (0, 3), (4, 4).\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nSnake #1 is currently coiled in the top-right corner. Their head is at (9, 9), meaning they have very limited mobility (they must move LEFT to (8, 9) this turn). \n\nI am at (9, 4). The closest apple to me is at (4, 4). If I move UP, I continue along the wall, but I eventually run into the tail of Snake #1 or the top-right corner where Snake #1 is currently trapped. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (8, 4), I begin a direct path toward the cluster of apples. My tail is currently at (8, 1) and (9, 1). Moving LEFT now is safe because my body will follow me, clearing the (9, x) column. \n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (8, 4). This initiates a trek toward the apples at (4, 4), (0, 4), and (0, 3). This move keeps me away from Snake #1 and puts me in a better position to claim the apples in the center and left of the board.\n\nLEFT",

This moves me directly adjacent to the apple at (0, 4) and avoids any immediate collision with Snake #1.\n3. **LEFT to (0, 5):** **SAFE**. This moves me toward the left wall. From (0, 5), I have easy access to (0, 4) and (0, 3).\n4. **RIGHT to (2, 5):** **SAFE**. This move is into an empty square. However, my body currently occupies (3, 5), so going right again would be blocked next turn.\n\n**Enemy Check:**\nSnake #1 is at (2, 7). Its possible moves:\n- **UP to (2, 8):** Safe.\n- **DOWN to (2, 6):** Safe (this cell is currently my body, but my body segment at (2, 6) moves this turn).\n- **LEFT to (1, 7):** Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (3, 7):** **DEADLY** (reversing into its own body segment).\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nI am tied with Snake #1. The nearest apples are (0, 4), (0, 3), and (2, 2). \n- Snake #1 is two squares above me. If I move **LEFT to (0, 5)**, I put the most distance between myself and the enemy head while positioning myself perfectly to sweep the vertical line of apples at (0, 4) and (0, 3).\n- Moving **DOWN to (1, 4)** is also very strong as it puts me adjacent to (0, 4) and (2, 4) (empty) and is a direct path to the apple cluster.\n- Given Snake #1's position at (2, 7), it is likely to try to move toward the top or loop around its own body. It is currently somewhat \"tangled\" in the middle-top.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (0, 5). This secures the left column and prepares me to take the apples at (0, 4) and (0, 3) in sequence. This path minimizes the risk of a head-on collision with Snake #1 if it moves aggressively downward.\n\nLEFT",
