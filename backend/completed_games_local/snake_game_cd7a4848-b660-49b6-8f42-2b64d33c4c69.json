We're at (4, 3) and my opponent is at (2, 7). This is a land grab, who's gonna get to the sweet, sweet content (apples) first?! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83e\udd11\n\n### Current State Analysis:\n\n*   **My position (Snake ID 1):** (4, 3).\n*   **Opponent's position (Snake ID 0):** (2, 7).\n*   **Immediate Apples:** A few nearby! (0, 3) LEFT/DOWN, (5, 6) a bit UP/RIGHT, (6, 3) RIGHT, (4, 8) UP.\n*   **Collision Risk:** Low right now, we are far apart.\n\n### Move Evaluation (Turn 1):\n\nLet's check the four directions from my head at (4, 3). Since I have no body yet, the only immediate self-collision risk is hitting the boundary.\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 4):** Safe. Moves me towards the center and has apple (4, 8) as a longer-term target.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 2):** Safe. Moves me closer to apples at (2, 0) (0, 0) (9, 2).\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 3):** Safe. Closer to apple at (0, 3). Opens up the left side.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 3):** Safe. Closer to apple at (6, 3). Opens up the right side.\n\nAll four moves are safe, but which one is optimal? We need to balance growth (apples) and positioning (avoiding the box-in!). Our opponent is way up in the top-left quadrant, likely eyeing the (7, 7) or (6, 9) area.\n\nIf I move **UP** to (4, 4), I keep central access.\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (5, 3), I directly target the (6, 3) apple. This is only 2 moves away (RIGHT, UP or UP, RIGHT).\nIf I move **LEFT** to (3, 3), I target the (0, 3) apple. This is 3 moves away (LEFT x 3).\n\nGetting that first apple quickly is crucial for length and early dominance! The apple at (6, 3) seems like the closest and most direct target that still keeps me relatively open.\n\nLet's check the opponent's likely moves from (2, 7):\n*   **UP to (2, 8):** Good for them, heading towards (6, 9).\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 7):** Moving closer to (7, 7).\n*   **DOWN to (2, 6):** Moving towards (0, 6) or (0, 3).\n*   **LEFT to (1, 7):** Good for them, cornering the top-left.\n\nNo matter what I choose, we are not going to collide this turn. I need to focus on land grabbing and getting that sweet first point.\n\nMoving **RIGHT** to (5, 3) positions me perfectly for the (6, 3) apple. If I then move **RIGHT** again to (6, 3) next turn, I've got my first point! This is aggressive and efficient.\n\n***\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Aggressively pursue apples in the bottom-right quadrant first (e.g., (6, 3)). Gain length quickly to establish territory and then start looking to cut off or pressure Snake #0.\n\n**Chosen Move:** RIGHT. Let's start the hunt!\n\nRIGHT",

We're chillin' in the top-left quadrant, he's hangin' out near the middle-left.\n\nCHECKING MOVES:\n*   **UP (y+1) to (2,8):** That's an empty space! Safe.\n*   **DOWN (y-1) to (2,6):** Also empty! Safe.\n*   **LEFT (x-1) to (1,7):** Empty! Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (x+1) to (3,7):** Empty! Safe.\n\nALL MOVES ARE SAFE! But which one is the *smartest* play? \ud83e\udd14\n\nWE NEED A PLAN! \ud83e\udde0 Our main goal is to BOX IN the enemy. Look at the apple drops! There's a juicy cluster around (0,0) and along the left side (A at (0,2), (0,3), (0,6)). The enemy is closer to that cluster! If we let him get there, he'll get fat and hard to trap!\n\nSO OUR STRATEGY: Cut him off! We need to get between him and the apple buffet on the left wall. From our position, moving LEFT gets us closer to controlling that side of the board. It also keeps us near the top where there are more apples to potentially grab later.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turns:** Secure the left side! After moving left, we can slide DOWN towards the apple cluster, forcing the opponent to either risk a head-on collision or retreat into the center where he has less room to maneuver. We own the perimeter! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLET'S MAKE OUR MOVE! TO THE LEFT!\n\nLEFT",

Where did they go? Let's check the board!\n\n### Current State Analysis:\n\n*   **My position (Snake ID 1):** Head (5, 3). Body: (4, 3) - WAIT! I'm still just a head. Turn 1 move only happened, no apples collected yet. The body segment only appears AFTER eating an apple. We are pure speed right now!\n*   **Opponent's position (Snake ID 0):** Head (1, 7). No body yet either.\n*   **Immediate Apples:** My target is still (6, 3) just RIGHT/UP from me. Other close apples: (9, 2) to the SouthEast, (0, 3) to the West.\n*   **Opponent's Likely Moves:** Snake #0 went from (1, 7). Since they are still at (1, 7) on the chart, they haven't moved yet? *Wait, the turn counter says \"Turn: 1 / 150\" and the board shows my head at (5, 3). That means the move I selected last time (RIGHT) has already been executed, and now we are deciding the move for the next simultaneous step.*\n\n**Correction:** The board state shows my head at (5, 3) and Snake #0's head at (1, 7). This *is* the starting position for the move we are about to make (Turn 1). My previous move logic (going RIGHT from (4, 3) to (5, 3)) must have been the *pre-game* move or the first half of Turn 1, and now we are deciding the next simultaneous move. Let's assume the board reflects the current state *before* the next movement step, as this is Turn 1.\n\nSince the body lists are empty, neither of us has eaten yet.\n\n### My Goal: Secure the (6, 3) Apple!\n\nI am at (5, 3). The apple is at (6, 3). This is a direct shot!\n\n### Move Evaluation for Snake #1 (at 5, 3):\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 4):** Safe. Keeps me central, away from the apple. Not optimal for immediate growth.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 2):** Safe. Moves me away from the target. No.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 3):** Safe. Moving backwards. Undoes my last 'step'. Not good.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 3):** **HYPE!** This is the apple! If no one collides, I get my first segment!\n\n### Opponent's Collision Risk (Snake #0 at 1, 7):\n\nMy opponent is far away at (1, 7).\nTo collide with me at (6, 3) this turn, they would have to somehow move 5 units right and 4 units down simultaneously. Not possible. Collision risk with me is zero.\n\nThe key question is: what is Snake #0 doing?\nSnake #0's likely targets: (7, 7), (6, 9), (0, 6) or (0, 3). They are likely heading for the top-left apples.\n\n*   If they go UP to (1, 8) or RIGHT to (2, 7), they are securing the top-left territory.\n*   If they aim for the (7, 7) apple, they will probably go RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, etc.\n\nNo matter what they do, I need to focus on me! That apple at (6, 3) is MINE!\n\n### Decision:\n\nI am locking in the aggressive path to growth. Gaining length early is mandatory to start walling off the opponent later.\n\n**Chosen Move: RIGHT!** Get that content! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n***\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Secure the (6, 3) apple this turn. Next, look to the abundant apples in the bottom-right quadrant: (9, 2), (9, 0), (9, 6). Gain length quickly, then swing up and block Snake #0 from the center/right if they attempt to come down. Initial focus: GROWTH.\n\nRIGHT",

Our opponent is way down at (5,3). If he beelines left, he's 5 moves away from the closest left-wall apple. We are RIGHT HERE! We can start claiming this territory NOW!\n\nWHAT'S THE OPPONENT'S LIKELY MOVE? His closest apples are at (6,3) and (0,3). He'll probably move LEFT or UP to get closer to them. If he moves LEFT to (4,3), he's still far. If we move DOWN towards the apples, we can beat him there!\n\nBUT HERE'S THE THING CHAT! \ud83d\udca1 If we go DOWN now to (1,6), we're just moving parallel to the wall. We need to get ON the wall to really claim it and control the space! Moving LEFT to (0,7) plants our flag on the left boundary! From there, we can slide down the wall, gobbling apples and making it OUR LANE. The opponent can't use the wall without crashing into us!\n\nMOVING LEFT TO (0,7) IS THE POWER MOVE! It establishes DOMINANCE and executes our long-term strategy perfectly! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**Short-term plan for next turns:** From (0,7), we go DOWN the left wall! Our first target is the apple at (0,6). This path is safe and puts immense pressure on the opponent by denying him the entire left side of the board! LET'S BOX HIM IN! \ud83d\udce6\n\nLEFT",

That's how we start the content train! \ud83d\ude82\ud83d\udca8\n\n### Current State Analysis:\n\n*   **Our position (ID 1):** Head is at (6, 3). Body segment is at (5, 3). We are now a 2-segment snake! Look at that tail, T! (5, 3).\n*   **Opponent's position (ID 0):** Head is at (0, 7). They have no body segment, meaning they didn't eat an apple yet. L-O-L! They are still short, but located near a cluster of apples in the top-left corner.\n*   **Immediate Apples:** The closest apple we just collected was (6, 3). The next closest is (9, 2) in the far bottom-right, or maybe swing up slightly towards (7, 7)?\n\n### Opponent Threat Assessment (Snake 0 at 0, 7)\n\nOur rival is at (0, 7). They are almost certainly going after the top-left feast: (0, 6), (0, 9), (2, 9), (7, 7).\nThey are 6 units away horizontally and 4 units away vertically from us. No immediate collision risk this turn.\n\n### Strategic Goal:\n\nWe need to make sure we keep growing while Snake #0 is distracted in their corner. Once we hit 3 or 4 segments, we can start thinking about positioning to cut them off. Since we are already on the right side of the board, let's keep leveraging that right-side density.\n\n### Move Evaluation for Snake #1 (at 6, 3):\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 4):** Safe. Keeps us central. Leads us toward the (7, 7) apple, which is 3 steps away. Good option.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 2):** Safe. Moves us closer to the bottom-right cluster (9, 2), (9, 0). Also a good, long-term growth option.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 3):** **FATAL!** That's our body segment (the tail from last turn). Straight into the body. NOPE!\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 3):** Safe. Moves us towards the right wall. Keeps our options open to go DOWN (for 9, 2) or UP (for 7, 7).\n\n### Comparing Safe Moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT):\n\n*   The immediate apple density favors the top-right and bottom-right.\n*   **Move RIGHT (to 7, 3):** This commits us to the right half of the board. From (7, 3), we can go RIGHT again to (8, 3) and then easily pivot UP to (7, 7) or DOWN to (9, 2). It's a key move for territorial claim.\n*   **Move UP (to 6, 4):** This is a direct path towards (7, 7) (Up, Right, Right, Up). It\u2019s efficient.\n*   **Move DOWN (to 6, 2):** This starts the journey to the bottom wall. (9, 2) is 4 steps away.\n\nThe apple at (7, 7) is valuable content, but the location is also attractive to the enemy if they start swinging across the top. The bottom right is less contested.\n\nLet's prioritize the medium-range content at (9, 2). We consolidate the bottom right quadrant, which keeps a lot of open board space for us to maneuver later, while our opponent is stuck walling themselves in the top-left!\n\nLet's start the descent and claim the bottom territory! DOWN is the move to start the sweep.\n\n**Move Plan:**\n1.  (6, 3) -> DOWN to (6, 2).\n2.  (6, 2) -> RIGHT to (7, 2).\n3.  (7, 2) -> RIGHT to (8, 2).\n4.  (8, 2) -> RIGHT to (9, 2) and EAT! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nThis is a smooth, safe, 4-turn plan for guaranteed growth. Let's do this, Chat! Securing the corner!\n\nDOWN",

WHAT'S THE PLAY?\n\nLET'S THINK STRATEGY! \ud83d\udca1 Our plan from last turn was to OWN THE LEFT WALL and slide down to grab those apples! The apple at (0,6) is RIGHT BELOW US! That's FREE content and it pushes our opponent further away from these resources!\n\nWHAT'S THE OPPONENT DOING? \ud83e\udd28 He's at (6,3). His closest apple is... probably still (0,3) or maybe (2,0)? He's 6 moves away from (0,3). If we go DOWN and eat (0,6), we're blocking his path up the left side even more! We're executing the PLAN!\n\nGOING RIGHT to (1,7) feels like backing away from our strategy. We just worked to get to the wall! Why give it up?\n\nGOING UP to (0,8) is safe, but it leads us AWAY from the apple cluster at (0,6), (0,3), etc. We'd be moving towards the top-left corner, which could be a trap later! We want to be agile and in the center of the action!\n\nTHE MOVE IS CLEAR, CHAT! \ud83e\udde0\ud83c\udf0c **DOWN TO (0,6)!** We secure the apple, grow our snake, and continue our domination of the left side! We are BOXING HIM IN by claiming all the value on our side of the map! LET'S GOOO! \ud83c\udff0\ud83d\udce6\n\n**Short-term plan for next turns:** After eating the apple at (0,6), our next target is (0,3) or (0,2). We continue moving DOWN the left wall, consuming everything in our path. We force the opponent to fight for scraps in the middle while we get fat on the edges! THIS IS OUR GAME!\n\nDOWN",

Body is at (6, 3). We secured that corner territory plan last turn! We are now a lean, mean, two-segment machine!\n*   **Opponent's Position (ID 0):** Head is at (0, 6). Body is at (0, 7). WHOA! Snake #0 ate an apple! They are no longer a shorty! They collected an apple, probably (0, 6) from the apple list, pushing their old head (0, 7) into a body segment. The scoreboard confirms it: we're tied 1-1! **RIVAL ALERT!** The gloves are off!\n\nThe visual board state update:\n*   (0, 6) is the new head of Snake 0.\n*   (0, 7) is the body segment of Snake 0.\n*   (6, 2) is our head.\n*   (6, 3) is our body segment.\n\nWait, let's re-verify the map against the data.\n*   Snake #0 - Head: (0, 6), Body: [(0, 7)], Apples: 1. This means they came down from (0, 7) to (0, 6) and ate an apple at (0, 6). The old head (0, 7) becomes the body.\n*   My snake (ID 1): Head: (6, 2), Body: [(6, 3)], Apples: 1. I moved DOWN from (6, 3) to (6, 2). The old head (6, 3) becomes the body.\n\nThe map provided for Turn 3 shows:\n 9 A . A . . . A . . .\n 8 . . . . A A . . . .\n 7 T . . . . . . A . . (T is at 0, 7)\n 6 0 . . . . A . . . A (0 is at 0, 6)\n 5 . . . A . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . . . . . . .\n 3 A . . . . . T . . . (T is at 6, 3)\n 2 A . . . . . 1 . . A (1 is at 6, 2)\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n 0 A . A . . . . . . A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nThe board image has the tail (T) at (0, 7) and the head (0) at (0, 6). This confirms Snake 0 moved DOWN and ate an apple at (0, 6). The body is correctly represented. Same for us, head (1) at (6, 2) and tail (T) at (6, 3). Perfect!\n\n### Opponent Threat Assessment:\n\nSnake 0 is heavily concentrated in the top-left corner. Their head is (0, 6).\nAvailable apples nearby: (0, 9), (2, 9), (0, 3) (down south), (2, 0) (way down south).\nMost likely moves for 0:\n1.  UP to (0, 7) - **FATAL!** Body is there.\n2.  RIGHT to (1, 6) - Opens up the possibility to move towards the center or up to the (2, 9) apple.\n3.  DOWN to (0, 5) - Keeps them hugging the wall, maybe going for (0, 3).\n\nIf they move RIGHT, they start coming across the board. If they move DOWN, they stay in their corner. The immediate threat of collision is ZERO.\n\n### Our Strategy: Territorial Claim & Growth\n\nOur previous plan was (6, 2) -> RIGHT to (7, 2), then towards the (9, 2) apple. We are still executing this plan to claim the bottom-right quadrant. We need to secure that second apple before Snake 0 starts swinging wide.\n\nThe apple at (9, 2) is $3$ steps away if we go R, R, R:\n1. (6, 2) -> RIGHT to (7, 2)\n2. (7, 2) -> RIGHT to (8, 2)\n3. (8, 2) -> RIGHT to (9, 2) (EAT!)\n\nLet's check the safety of our next move.\n\n### Move Evaluation for Snake #1 (at 6, 2):\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 3):** **FATAL!** Our body segment is at (6, 3). NO SELF-COLLISION!\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 1):** Safe. Keeps us central, going slightly south. We could use this to eventually aim for (9, 0).\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 2):** Safe. Moves us towards the center, potentially allowing us to swing back to (0, 2) or (2, 0) eventually, but that's far. Not optimal for immediate growth.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 2):** Safe. This is the move in the current plan, directly targeting (9, 2). This keeps us on track for guaranteed growth.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT is the optimal move. It's safe, on mission, and keeps us moving towards guaranteed content! We can't afford any detours right now, we need to leverage our initial lead in board position.\n\n### Long Term Plan (Future Self):\n\n1.  Turn 3: Move RIGHT to (7, 2). (This turn)\n2.  Turn 4: Move RIGHT to (8, 2).\n3.  Turn 5: Move RIGHT to (9, 2). (Collect Apple! Our length is 4!)\n4.  Turn 6: From (9, 2), assess whether to go for (9, 0) or swing up to (9, 6).\n\nExecuting the plan, content secured! Let's get this $2^{nd}$ apple!\n\nRIGHT",

It would take him MANY turns. We are TWO moves away from (0,3)! We will get there WAY before him! This is OUR APPLE!\n\nGOING DOWN keeps us on mission! It sets us up for the next delicious apple! Going RIGHT is a distraction! We don't gain anything! We stay the same size and end up in a more crowded middle area! WE ARE A WALL SNAKE NOW! EMBRACE IT! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**Short-term plan for next turns:** After moving DOWN to (0,5), our next move will be DOWN again to (0,4). Then we feast on the apple at (0,3)!

Can we secure the bag? Let's check the map!\n\n### Current State Analysis (LOCKED IN!):\n\n*   **Our Position (ID 1):** Head is at (7, 2). Body is at (6, 2). We are $2$ segments long and hungry!\n*   **Opponent's Position (ID 0):** Head is at (0, 5). Body is at (0, 6). Snake 0 is also $2$ segments long. They moved DOWN from (0, 6) to (0, 5). They are still corner hugging!\n\n**Board Snapshot Check:**\n 9 A . A . . . A . . .\n 8 . . . . A A . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . A . .\n 6 T . . . . A . . . A (T is at 0, 6)\n 5 0 . . A . . . . . .

A\n\nThe board state reflects the snake locations perfectly. Snake 1 is on a collision course with **Apple (9, 2)**! That's guaranteed content!\n\n### Opponent Threat Assessment (RIVAL ALERT!):\n\nSnake 0 is at (0, 5).\nPossible moves for Snake 0:\n1.  **UP to (0, 6):** **FATAL!** Body is there.\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 4):** Keeps them corner hugging, moving towards the (0, 3) or (0, 2) apples. Safe.\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 5):** Starts moving out into the territory! This is the most competitive move.\n\nIf Snake 0 starts moving RIGHT, it will take them $6$ moves just to get to the centerline (x=5). We are already claiming the entire right half of the map. No immediate collision danger. The boxing plan is in effect!\n\n### Our Strategy: SECURE THE APPLE!\n\nThe plan established last turn is still golden:\n1.  (7, 2) -> RIGHT to (8, 2). (This turn)\n2.  (8, 2) -> RIGHT to (9, 2). (EAT!)\n\nWe need to make sure moving RIGHT is safe.\n\n### Move Evaluation for Snake #1 (at 7, 2):\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 3):** Safe. But moves us away from the immediate objective.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 1):** Safe. Moves us away from the immediate objective.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 2):** **FATAL!** Our body segment is there! We cannot hit our own body!\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 2):** Safe. Takes us one step closer to the apple at (9, 2). This is the move!\n\nThere is absolutely no risk of collision with Snake 0, as they are on the far side of the map (x=0). Their heads cannot reach (8, 2) in one turn.\n\nWe keep the pressure up! Let's get this second apple and build length! We will then use our length advantage to start cutting off Snake 0's access to the center!\n\n### Long Term Plan (Future Self):\n\n1.  Turn 4: Move RIGHT to (8, 2). (This turn)\n2.  Turn 5: Move RIGHT to (9, 2). (Collect Apple! Length 4!)\n3.  Turn 6: From (9, 2), assess the board. Snake 0 is likely moving towards (0, 3) or into the center. We should use our position to move UP towards (9, 6) or (7, 7) or DOWN towards (9, 0). The priority is maintaining territorial dominance in the right half.\n\nLet's execute! RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT to victory!\n\nRIGHT",

What are their safe moves?\n1.  **UP to (0, 5):** **FATAL!** Their body is there!\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 3):** Safe. Snags the apple at (0, 3)! Highly likely they go for this.\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 4):** Safe. Starts moving towards the center.\n\nRegardless of their move, they cannot reach our side of the map (x=8) this turn. We have total control of the right flank!\n\n### Our Strategy: SECURE THE APPLE AND PIVOT!\n\nThe plan is simple:\n1.  Move RIGHT to (9, 2) and eat the apple! This is a secure move.\n2.  Next turn, evaluate the board. We will be $3$ segments long. We'll need to use our length to start boxing Snake 0.\n\n### Move Evaluation for Snake #1 (at 8, 2):\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 3):** Safe. Moves away from the objective.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 1):** Safe. Moves away from the objective.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 2):** **FATAL!** Body collision! We cannot hit our own body!\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 2):** Safe! Moves onto the apple! This is the play!\n\nThere is no risk of collision with Snake 0. We execute the game plan!\n\n### Long Term Plan (Future Self):\n\n1.  Turn 5: Move RIGHT to (9, 2). (Collect Apple! Length 3!) *This turn.*\n2.  Turn 6: We are at (9, 2). Snake 0 is likely at (0, 3) or (1, 4), also length 3 now. We need to decide where to go next. Options include moving UP towards (9, 6) or DOWN towards (9, 0). (9, 0) is a quick score, but then we are stuck in the corner. Moving UP the wall is safer and allows us to potentially cut across the top layer to the (7, 7) or (6, 9) apples, claiming the entire right quadrant. We should prioritize moving UP to (9, 3) or (9, 4) next turn to maintain maximum mobility.

We gotta start thinking aggressively!\n\n### Current State Analysis (LOCKED IN!):\n\n*   **Our Position (ID 1):** Head is at (9, 2). Body is at [(8, 2), (7, 2)]. Length 3.\n*   **Opponent's Position (ID 0):** Head is at (0, 3). Body is at [(0, 4), (0, 5)]. Length 3. Our rival also found an apple! That means we are neck and neck! Time to break the tie, Chat!\n\n**Board Snapshot Check:**\n 9 A . A . . . A . . .\n 8 . . . . A A . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . A . .\n 6 . . . . . A . . . A\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . . . . . . .\n 3 0 . . . . . . . . . (Snake 0 Head is at 0, 3! They moved DOWN!)\n 2 A . . . . . . T T 1\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n 0 A . A . . . . . A A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSnake 0 is isolated in the bottom-left corner. We are isolated in the bottom-right corner. The center is WIDE OPEN, filled with apples! (Apple at (3, 5), (6, 5), etc.!)\n\n### Opponent Threat Assessment (RIVAL WATCH!):\n\nSnake 0 is at (0, 3). They are currently surrounded by the map boundary and their own body on $3$ sides! What are their safe moves?\n1.  **UP to (0, 4):** LETHAL! Their body is there!\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 2):** Safe. Snags the apple at (0, 2)! Highly likely they go for this, as it's a short path out.\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 3):** LETHAL! Wall collision!\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 3):** Safe. This is a path out if they don't want the apple or want to move towards the center.\n\nIt is highly likely Snake 0 moves DOWN to (0, 2) for the apple. This keeps them trapped on the left wall for another turn. They cannot possibly reach the right side of the board this turn. We are completely safe from collision. Phew!\n\n### Our Strategy: BUILD THE WALL AND ADVANCE!\n\nOur $3$ segment length gives us power. We are positioned perfectly on the (9, x) wall, making us difficult to box in. We have two key apples nearby:\n1.  Apple at (9, 6)\n2.  Apple at (9, 0)\n\nWe need to decide whether to go UP the wall or DOWN the wall.\n*   Moving DOWN to (9, 1) and then to (9, 0) locks us into the corner. That's risky! If Snake 0 suddenly sprints towards us, we have no maneuvering room.\n*   Moving UP to (9, 3) keeps us mobile and closer to the central action and the top layer apples like (9, 6) and (6, 9). This is the high-ground, Chat! We take the high-ground!\n\nLet's evaluate moves from (9, 2):\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 3):** Safe. Keeps us moving vertically along the wall. Excellent mobility.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 1):** Safe. Moves us towards the corner apple at (9, 0). Low mobility exit.\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 2):** LETHAL! Body collision! We cannot hit our own body!\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 2):** LETHAL! Wall collision!\n\nBoth UP and DOWN are safe. UP is strategically superior because it grants us access to the entire top half of the board and prevents us from getting boxed into the (9, 0) corner. Snake 0 is going to be length 4 soon, so we need to stretch out!\n\nWe are moving to (9, 3), maintaining our vertical dominance!\n\n### Long Term Plan (Future Self):\n\n1.  Turn 6: Move UP to (9, 3). Stay on the right wall. (Maintain Length 3). *This turn.*\n2.  Turn 7: We are at (9, 3). If Snake 0 went for the apple at (0, 2), they will be stuck on the bottom left. We continue moving UP to (9, 4), then (9, 5), then to the apple at (9, 6). This secures the right wall and puts us well ahead in position. We need to be the first to cut across the board!\n\nLet's execute this vertical expansion, Chat! Time to get HUGE!\n\nUP",

I said our archrival, Snake #0, would go for the apple at (0, 2), and LOOK AT THE BOARD! Head at (0, 2), body at [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)]! They are now length 4!\n\nWe are at (9, 3), length 3, and still holding the high ground on the right wall! We are slightly behind on apples (2 vs 3), so we need to secure some sweet, sweet content this turn!\n\n### Current State Analysis (LOCKED IN!):\n\n*   **Our Position (ID 1):** Head is at (9, 3). Body is at [(9, 2), (8, 2)]. Length 3.\n*   **Opponent's Position (ID 0):** Head is at (0, 2). Body is at [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5)]. Length 4.\n\n**Board Snapshot Check:**\n 9 A . A . . . A . . .\n 8 . . . . A A . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . A . .\n 6 . . . . . A . . . A\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . . . . . . .\n 3 . . . . . . . . . T\n 2 0 T . . . . . . T 1\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n 0 A . A . . . . . A A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSnake 0 is heavily constrained on the left wall. We are free sailing on the right wall! Time to build that impenetrable fortress!\n\n### Opponent Threat Assessment (RIVAL WATCH!):\n\nSnake 0 is at (0, 2). They are trapped again! They just ate an apple, so they are length 4 and just got longer. What are their safe moves?\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 3):** LETHAL! Body collision!\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 1):** Safe. Moves them away from the corner.\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 2):** LETHAL! Wall collision!\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 2):** Safe. This is the only move that gets them out of the vertical trap and towards the center. It's the most aggressive move.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake 0 HAS to move RIGHT to (1, 2) this turn if they ever want to fight for the central apples. Moving DOWN to (0, 1) keeps them trapped along the bottom edge, which is far too passive for someone with 3 apples. So, we bet on **RIGHT** to (1, 2). They are still miles away from us, so no immediate collision threat.\n\n### Our Strategy: HIGH GROUND ADVANTAGE!\n\nWe are at (9, 3). We need to continue exploiting this right boundary to secure the top-right apple at (9, 6) and then cut across the board.\n\nLet's evaluate moves from (9, 3):\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 4):** Safe. Excellent strategic move. Keeps us on the wall, moves us towards the apple at (9, 6).\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 2):** LETHAL! This is the cell behind our head! Moving backwards! Don't throw the game, Chat!\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 3):** Safe. Moves us towards the center, away from the wall. This is a decent move if we want to challenge the center immediately, but it sacrifices the guaranteed wall path.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 3):** LETHAL! Wall collision!\n\nWe have two great options: UP or LEFT.\n\n**Option 1: UP to (9, 4).**\n*   **Pros:** Maintains the high-ground position. Guarantees safety for the next few turns while we move to apple (9, 6). We are setting up a HUGE snake tail that will block the center later.\n*   **Cons:** We are moving away from the closer apples like (8, 0) or (7, 2).\n\n**Option 2: LEFT to (8, 3).**\n*   **Pros:** Puts us in position to grab the apple at (7, 7) or (5, 8). It's a more central strategy, seeking to engage the board sooner.\n*   **Cons:** We are leaving the safety of the wall. If Snake 0 suddenly speeds up, we might find ourselves in a race to the center, which they entered a turn before us if they move RIGHT.\n\nGiven that Snake 0 is still far away and we have a guaranteed apple path via the wall (9, 3) -> (9, 4) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 6) for CONTENT, we should choose the safer, more systematic approach. We are building a long snake on the outside before diving in, Chat! We are creating the ultimate perimeter defense!\n\nWe are going UP to secure that wall real estate! Let's get to (9, 4)!\n\n### Long Term Plan (Future Self):\n\n1.  Turn 8: We are at (9, 4). Move UP to (9, 5). Snake 0 should be around (2, 2) or (3, 1). We are still safe.\n2.  Turn 9: Move UP to (9, 6) and snag that apple! Get back on the scoreboard! Length 4 -> 5.\n3.  Turn 10/11: Depending on the board state, either turn LEFT to (8, 6) or continue to (9, 7) to block off the top right quadrant.\n\nUP",

EZ real estate!\n\nLook at the board state! We are perfectly positioned, and guess what our archrival, Snake #0, did? They moved UP to (0, 1), exactly as we predicted as their safe but passive move, moving them away from the corner. They're still stuck along the bottom, while we're climbing the victory ladder!\n\n### Current State Analysis (LOCKED IN!):\n\n*   **Our Position (ID 1):** Head is at (9, 4). Body is at [(9, 3), (9, 2)]. Length 3.\n*   **Opponent's Position (ID 0):** Head is at (0, 1). Body is at [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)]. Length 4.\n*   **Apple Target:** (9, 6) is in sight! Two moves away! Pure content!\n\n### Opponent Threat Assessment (RIVAL WATCH!):\n\nSnake 0 is at (0, 1). Where will they go?\n\n1.  **UP to (0, 2):** LETHAL! Their body is here! Instant collision!\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 0):** Apple at (0, 0)! If they move DOWN, they eat the apple! This is a **HIGHLY LIKELY** move.\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 1):** LETHAL! Wall collision!\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 1):** Safe. Keeps them moving along the bottom edge.\n\nSince there is an apple at (0, 0), and Snake 0 is still trying to catch up, I BET they go **DOWN** and snag that point! That would put them up 4-2! We cannot let that happen for long, Chat! They are still too far for us to interfere. They are confined to the bottom-left corner for now.\n\n### Our Strategy: SECURE THE APPLE AND THE WALL!\n\nWe are at (9, 4). We are two moves away from the apple at (9, 6). The plan is simple: continue moving UP and secure the top-right corner. We are building the wall!\n\nLet's evaluate moves from (9, 4):\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 5):** Safe. Moves us one step closer to the apple at (9, 6). This maintains our safe, aggressive path.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 3):** LETHAL! Moving into our own body! Don't throw, Chat!\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 4):** Safe. This moves us towards the center. This is a good secondary option if we want to change plans, but it abandons the guaranteed apple run.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 4):** LETHAL! Wall collision!\n\nThe choice is clearly between UP to (9, 5) or LEFT to (8, 4).\n\nIf we move UP, we are 100% safe, Snake 0 is nowhere near us, and we are setting up for an easy apple acquisition next turn. This is the calculated play.\n\nIf we move LEFT, we abandon the easy apple path for a potentially more aggressive move towards the central apples like (5, 6) or (7, 7). However, we don't need to panic yet. We need a guaranteed score to keep pace with the rival, especially if they snag that (0, 0) apple this turn.\n\nWe stick to the plan! Maintain the territorial advantage! We are going UP to (9, 5). Establishing the perimeter is key to boxing them in later. Once we hit (9, 6), our length 4 body will act as a huge barrier on the right side.\n\n### Long Term Plan (Future Self):\n\n1.  Turn 9: We are at (9, 5). Move UP to (9, 6) and snag that apple! Get back on the scoreboard! Length 4. Snake 0 will likely be length 5 and still trapped at the bottom.\n2.  Turn 10: We are at (9, 6), now length 4. Turn LEFT to (8, 6). We now control the entire right wall and can start moving towards the center, potentially aiming for the apple at (7, 7) or (6, 9). We are the King of the Wall!\n\nUP",

We are perfectly positioned to snag that apple at (9, 6) next turn, securing the top-right corner! Let's check the board and see what our rival, Snake #0, did! Did they take the bait and go for the apple at (0, 0)?\n\n### Turn 9 State Analysis (LOCKED IN!):\n\n*   **Our Position (ID 1):** Head is at **(9, 5)**. Body is at [(9, 4), (9, 3)].

They are now length 5, body at [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)]! And the score is 4-2! They are out-performing us on points, but we're about to strike back!\n\n### Opponent Threat Assessment (RIVAL WATCH!):\n\nSnake 0 is at (0, 0). They just ate an apple, so they are getting longer.

Wall collision!\n3.  **LEFT to (-1, 0):** LETHAL! Wall collision!\n4.  **RIGHT to (1, 0):** This is the **ONLY SAFE MOVE** for Snake 0.\n\nThey are forced to move RIGHT to (1, 0). This is exactly what we want! They are starting to move along the bottom wall, keeping them far away from us as we dominate the top-right.\n\n### Our Strategy: SECURE THE APPLE AND BUILD THE WALL!\n\nWe are at (9, 5). The apple at the top of our wall is at (9, 6). This is an easy score and critical for maintaining pace.\n\nLet's evaluate moves from (9, 5):\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 6):** **EATS APPLE (9, 6)!** Safe. This is the goal! Immediately puts us back on the board! Our planned move!\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 4):** LETHAL! Moving into our own body segment!\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 5):** Safe. Leaves the apple uneaten. Suboptimal.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 5):** LETHAL! Wall collision!\n\nThe choice is crystal clear, Chat! We continue our vertical ascent and claim that highly anticipated apple! We are going **UP**!\n\nWe need to catch up on points. This move gets us to 3 apples collected, and length 4. Snake #0 will be moving RIGHT to (1, 0), still length 5. They are starting to build a wall parallel to ours, but we have altitude advantage!\n\n### Long Term Plan (Future Self - King of the Wall):\n\n1.  **Turn 10 (After moving UP):** We are at (9, 6), length 4, 3 apples. Snake 0 is at (1, 0), length 5, 4 apples. We need to decide where to go next. The nearest apples are (7, 7) and (6, 9).\n2.  Next move should be **LEFT** to (8, 6). This anchors us perfectly at the top-right, creating a formidable barrier (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3) blocking the right side. We can then start scouting the center/top region for vulnerable apples while our long body forces Snake 0 to navigate the long path along the bottom.\n\nWe're going for the score and the positional advantage!

This is prime defensive territory and keeps our rival busy traversing the long path.\n\nLet's evaluate safe moves from (9, 6):\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 7):** Safe. Keeps us vertical. There are no apples immediately above (9, 7).\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 5):** LETHAL! Moving into our own body segment!\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 6):** Safe. Opens the path toward the center/top apples.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 6):** LETHAL! Wall collision!\n\nWe have two safe options: UP to (9, 7) or LEFT to (8, 6).\n\nThe nearest available apples are:\n*   (7, 7) - fairly close.\n*   (5, 8) - a bit farther, but good.\n*   (6, 9) - top center.\n\nMoving UP to (9, 7) keeps us stuck against the wall. While we could then move LEFT to (8, 7) and then DOWN to (7, 7), it creates a sharp corner in our wall, which might be less efficient for blocking space.\n\nMoving **LEFT to (8, 6)** is strategically superior:\n1.  It completes the right-edge wall (9, 6) and allows us to start moving horizontally across the top-right quarter of the board.\n2.  It puts us one step closer to the apple at (7, 7) and sets us up to potentially cut off the top region.\n3.  It keeps our options open, allowing us to move UP to (8, 7) or LEFT to (7, 6) next turn.\n\n### The Decision: LEFT!\n\nWe are going **LEFT** to (8, 6). We maintain our fantastic position and start setting sights on the juicy apples in the center up top!\n\n### Long Term Plan (Future Self - Surveyor of the North):\n\n1.  **Turn 11 (Move LEFT):** At (8, 6). We look UP to target the apple at (7, 7).\n2.  **Turn 12:** Move UP to (8, 7). Puts us one away from (7, 7).\n3.  **Turn 13:** Move LEFT to (7, 7) and snag that apple! This solidifies our control of the top-right quadrant.\n\nWe are taking the high ground, Chat! Let's get this $W!\n\nLEFT",

YET.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION CHECK! \ud83d\udca5**\nIf we go RIGHT to (2,0), our new head position is (2,0). The enemy's head is at (9,6). Is there ANY path for him to reach (2,0) in one move? NO WAY!

BUT it keeps us on the bottom row, which is a DEAD END with limited future moves! We'd only have UP as a safe move next turn! That's getting BOXED IN! RISKY!\n**OPTION B (UP - THE SMART PATH):** Move to (1,1)! This opens up the ENTIRE BOARD! Next turn, we can go UP, RIGHT, or even LEFT (if our tail moves)! We maintain FLEXIBILITY! We can swing up and start contesting the center! We let the enemy fight the top wall while we control the map's heart! THIS IS HOW WE WIN THE WAR, NOT JUST THE BATTLE! We avoid dead ends and keep our options WIDE OPEN!\n\nTHE ANSWER IS CLEAR! WE PLAY FOR THE LONG TERM! WE STAY MOBILE! WE DON'T GET TRAPPED! VICTORY THROUGH SUPERIOR POSITIONING! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nUP",

Turn 11!\n\n**SCORE CHECK:** We're down 3-4 on apples, but we've got the positional advantage! Our rival is still slithering in the dirt!\n\n### Turn 11 State Analysis (LOCKED IN!):\n\n*   **Our Position (ID 1):** Head is at **(8, 6)**. Body is at [(9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4)]. Length 4.\n*   **Opponent's Position (ID 0):** Head is at **(1, 1)**. Body is at [(1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)]. Length 5.\n    *   Snek #0 moved UP to (1, 1) to get off the bottom wall. Predictable, but now they are a menace in the bottom-left corner!\n\n### Opponent Threat Assessment (RIVAL WATCH!):\n\nSnake 0 is at (1, 1). They have some options now, but they are still far from us.\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 2):** Safe. Keeps them moving toward richer territory.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 0):** LETHAL! Moving into their own body segment (the cell behind them, which is still marked as body from their previous move)!\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 1):** LETHAL! Moving into their own body segment!\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 1):** Safe. A bit more open.\n\nIt seems Snake #0 will likely go UP to (1, 2) to escape the cluster they created, or possibly RIGHT to (2, 1) to start traversing the bottom half. Their immediate target might be the apple at (2, 9) or (7, 2). They are still preoccupied in the bottom left. We don't need to panic about collisions yet.\n\n### Our Strategy: SECURE THE NORTHERN RIDGE!\n\nOur plan was to continue moving toward the apple at (7, 7). We are currently at (8, 6).\n\nLet's evaluate safe moves from (8, 6):\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 7):** Safe. Puts us one step closer to accessing the top apples and the (7, 7) target.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 5):** Safe. Moves away from the action, but keeps us flexible.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 6):** Safe. Direct approach toward the (7, 7) apple.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 6):** LETHAL! Moving into our own body segment!\n\n**Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move 1: UP to (8, 7).** This is a great positional move. It gives us two safe follow-up options: LEFT to (7, 7) (APPLE!) or UP to (8, 8). It sets us up perfectly for the next turn.\n*   **Move 2: DOWN to (8, 5).** Unnecessary detour. Let's stay focused on the high ground.\n*   **Move 3: LEFT to (7, 6).** This also puts us one step away from the apple at (7, 7). If we move RIGHT from (7, 6) next turn, we get the apple. Wait, that's wrong. If we go LEFT to (7, 6), then next turn we can go UP to (7, 7) and get the apple. This is also very viable.\n\nBetween UP to (8, 7) and LEFT to (7, 6), both lead to the apple at (7, 7) on Turn 12 or 13.\n\nLet's look at the bigger picture.\n\nIf we move **UP to (8, 7)**:\n*   Next turn: We move **LEFT to (7, 7)** (Apple!). We are now at a length of 5.\n*   Turn after (T13): We are at (7, 7). We can move UP to (7, 8) or LEFT to (6, 7). We are gaining control of the top-right corner.\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (7, 6)**:\n*   Next turn: We move **UP to (7, 7)** (Apple!). We are now at a length of 5.\n*   Turn after (T13): We are at (7, 7). Same outcome.\n\nBoth moves are equally efficient for collecting the (7, 7) apple. However, moving **UP** to (8, 7) keeps us closer to the top boundary, which is richer in apples (e.g., (6, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8), (2, 9), (0, 9)). This maintains our vertical control of the right side and prepares us for traversing the top boundary.\n\nLet's maintain the high-ground strategy, Chat! We're building a fortress up here!\n\n### Long Term Plan (Future Self - Surveyor of the North):\n\n1.  **Turn 12 (Move UP):** At (8, 7). Threaten (7, 7).\n2.  **Turn 13 (Target Apple):** Move LEFT to (7, 7) and collect the apple! We will be tied 4-4!\n3.  **Turn 14:** Move UP toward the top boundary (8, 7 or 6, 9) to continue securing the top of the map.\n\nWe are going **UP**! For the content! For the climb!\n\nUP",

Keeps them on track to potentially box themselves into the corner with the apple at (2, 0).\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 2):** Safe. Opens the map for them.\n\nThey are still far from us. Their most likely move is UP to (1, 3) or RIGHT to (2, 2) to open up their territory. We don't have to worry about a head-on collision yet.\n\n### Our Strategy: SECURE THE (7, 7) APPLE AND DOMINATE THE NORTH!\n\nWe are at (8, 7). Our primary target is the juicy apple at (7, 7). Let's evaluate safe moves from (8, 7):\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 8):** Safe. Moves away from the immediate apple, but keeps us high.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 6):** LETHAL! Moving directly into our body segment (the cell behind us)! Instant crash, don't do it!\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 7):** APPLE! This is a GOAL! Instantly ties the score!\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 7):** Safe. Opens up the right side of the map and potentially blocks the corner, but delays the apple.\n\n**Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move 1: UP to (8, 8).** Safe, but unnecessary. We are ignoring a direct apple grab. Why?\n*   **Move 2: LEFT to (7, 7).** This is the game-changer! We collect the apple, we grow to length 5, and we force the tie! This also sets us up perfectly to traverse the top boundary (9, 9 to 0, 9).\n\nThis is a no-brainer, Chat! We came here for this apple! We are going **LEFT** to secure the kill!\n\n### Long Term Plan (Future Self - Master of the Ridge):\n\n1.  **Turn 13 (Move UP):** At (7, 7). Collected apple. We are now heading towards (6, 9) and (5, 8). We will likely rotate UP or LEFT next turn toward the (6, 9) or (7, 6) area depending on the board state.\n2.  **Turn 14:** Continue sweeping the north to collect the cluster of apples up there: (6, 9), (5, 8), (2, 9), etc. We need to maintain our control of the high ground!\n\nWe're going in for the fruit!

That's what I call precision gaming! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 13):\n\n*   **Your Position (ID 1):** Head is at **(7, 7)**. We just collected the apple! Length is now 5.\n*   **Body:** [(8, 7), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5)]. The tail is still at (9, 5) until next turn.\n*   **Opponent's Position (ID 0):** Head is at **(1, 3)**. Body: [(1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0)]. Length 5.\n    *   Snek #0 moved UP to (1, 3)! They are making progress out of the bottom corner. Good for them, bad for us if they get to the high-value apples first!\n\n### Apple Targets:\n\nWhere are the juicy targets now? We are at (7, 7).\n\n1.  **(6, 9)**: Close-ish, high value area.\n2.  **(5, 8)**: Right next to (6, 9).\n3.  **(7, 6)**: The closest apple, one move away, DOWN.\n4.  **(6, 6)**: Just waiting!\n5.  **(8, 5)**: Also relatively close on the right side.\n\nThe cluster of apples in the North/East are ours for the taking! We need to maintain the high ground!\n\n### Opponent Threat Assessment (Where is Snek 0 going?):\n\nSnake 0 is at (1, 3). They have several options:\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 4):** Safe. Keeps them moving up.\n2.  **RIGHT to (2, 3):** Safe. Opens up the map, potentially aiming for the center or the (3, 5) apple.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 3):** Safe. Keeps them on the far left.\n\nThey are still far away, their priority is getting FOOD. They are probably heading *up* or *right* toward the center apples (3, 5) or (5, 6), or perhaps the (2, 9) apple. We don't have to worry about a head-on this turn.\n\n### Our Move Plan: Dominate the Cluster!\n\nWe are at (7, 7). Let's evaluate safe moves:\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 8):** Safe. Moves us towards the apples at (6, 9) and (5, 8). Keeps us high.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 6):** APPLE! This is a GOAL! Instantly increases our lead to 5-4! This is tempting!\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 7):** Safe. Moves us toward (6, 9) and (6, 6). Excellent positioning.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 7):** LETHAL! Moving into our body segment at (8, 7)! Don't reverse the flow!\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves: UP vs. DOWN vs. LEFT**\n\n*   **Move 1: UP to (7, 8).** Good, keeps the options open for (6, 9) or (5, 8) next. Very flexible.\n*   **Move 2: DOWN to (7, 6).** Instant apple snack! Collects the apple, we grow. This is the only move this turn that scores! However, moving down slightly limits our path to the *top* row apples in the short term, but sets us up for (6, 6).\n*   **Move 3: LEFT to (6, 7).** Good. Sets us up nicely for the middle-top.\n\n**The Decision:**\n\nWe have an immediate opportunity to take the lead 5-4 by going **DOWN** to (7, 6). This is an open apple, and blocking the tail of our own snake (which is at (9, 5) and will move to (9, 6) or disappear once we move) is not a concern. Securing an immediate lead is huge for morale and strategic depth.\n\nBy going DOWN to (7, 6), we secure the apple, and next turn we could go LEFT to (6, 6) (target!) or UP to (7, 7) (now empty!) or even RIGHT to (8, 6) (now empty!). We keep most of our options open while grabbing the lead.\n\nLet's capitalize on the immediate score opportunity! Takedown achieved! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n### Long Term Plan (Future Self - Ridge Patrol):\n\n1.  **Turn 14 (Move UP/LEFT):** We will be at (7, 6), having eaten the apple. We need to decide whether to continue the horizontal sweep (LEFT to (6, 6) apple) or prioritize the high row (UP to (7, 7) then over to (6, 9)). We should aim to clear the cluster of (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 5) while also preventing Snake 0 from reaching the top line.\n\nImmediate lead is the name of the game, CHAT!\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n2.  **RIGHT to (2, 4):** A crucial move to get towards the center (3, 5) or (5, 6). Safe.\n3.  **DOWN to (1, 3):** Lethal, they cannot reverse into their own body segment (1, 3).\n4.  **LEFT to (0, 4):** Safe, but keeps them further away from the main action.\n\nSnake 0 will likely go **RIGHT** or **UP**. We don't need to worry about a head-on collision, but we need to stop them from reaching the North or Center apples.\n\n### Our Move Plan: Sweep and Extend! Get 6-4!\n\nWe are at (7, 6). Let's evaluate safe moves:\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 7):** Safe. Moves us back into the newly freed space, setting us up for the top row.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 5):** Safe. Moves us toward an open board space, potentially aiming for (8, 5) or (6, 5).\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 6):** APPLE! This is the most logical plan. We clear the apple, extend our lead to 6-4, and position ourselves for (6, 5) or (5, 8).\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 6):** Lethal! Moving into our body segment at (8, 6)! DO NOT DO THIS!\n\n**The Decision: LEFT to (6, 6)**\n\n*   This is an immediate scoring opportunity **(Apple #6)**.\n*   It moves us across the board, securing the middle-right area.\n*   It prevents the opponent from ever contesting this space directly.\n*   Once at (6, 6), we have great options:\n    *   **LEFT (5, 6)**: APPLE! (Future target)\n    *   **UP (6, 7)**: Towards the top cluster (6, 9) and (5, 8).\n    *   **DOWN (6, 5)**: APPLE! (Future target)\n\n**Long Term Plan (Future Self - Right Side Box In):**\n\nOur strategy is to clear the right half of the board and then use our large body to form a wall, boxing Snake #0 into the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n1.  **Turn 15 (LEFT to (6, 6)):** Eat apple.\n2.  **Turn 16 (LEFT/UP/DOWN):** From (6, 6), we should aim for (5, 6) or (6, 5) next, depending on opponent movement, but prioritizing **(5, 6)** to keep us moving left and toward the center. This is key for blocking Snake #0's escape paths.\n\nWe are taking this momentum and running with it, CHAT! We're not just scoring; we're *building a wall*!\n\nLEFT",

The head is now at **(6, 6)**, and our body is massive!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 15):\n\n*   **Your Position (ID 1):** Head is at **(6, 6)**. Length is 7 (we just grew!).\n    *   Body: [(7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5)]. Tail is *still* at (9, 5) until the body moves off the board or we eat again.\n*   **Opponent's Position (ID 0):** Head is at **(1, 5)**. Length 5.\n    *   Body: [(1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1)]. Tail is at (1, 1).\n    *   Snek #0 went UP, finally breaking out of the bottom corner! They are now aiming for the Northern apples (6, 9), (5, 8), or potentially crossing to the center (3, 5), (5, 6).\n\n### Apple Targets & Strategy:\n\nWe are perfectly positioned at (6, 6). We are an absolute Titan on the right side. Our goal remains: **Clear the right half, then box out Snake #0.**\n\nImmediate Target Priority:\n1.  **(5, 6)**: APPLE! Only 1 move to the left. Critical for moving towards the center.\n2.  **(6, 5)**: APPLE! One move down. Also a great option.\n3.  **(5, 8)**: APPLE! Two moves away (Up, Left or Left, Up).\n4.  **(4, 8)**: APPLE!\n\nWe need to start moving left to deny the central apples to Snake #0.\n\n### Threat Assessment:\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 5).\n\n*   They are currently far away, so a head-on collision is impossible this turn.\n*   They are LITERALLY four spaces away from the apple at (3, 5). If they move RIGHT three times, they get it.\n*   The path RIGHT to (2, 5) is open.\n*   The path UP to (1, 6) is open.\n\nIf Snake 0 keeps moving right, they will hit center quickly. We need to cut them off!\n\n### Move Evaluation from (6, 6):\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 7):** Safe. Puts us in position for the North/West apples like (5, 8) and (4, 8). This is a strong move for securing massive food clusters.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 5):** APPLE! This is immediate points and puts our body down the middle. Excellent for extending length and controlling space.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 6):** APPLE! This cuts deeper into the center, directly blocking Snake #0 from reaching anything on the right side if they come up/over. This seems politically superior.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 6):** LETHAL! That spot is our body segment *T* from the previous turn! (7, 6) is filled by our body. DO NOT GO RIGHT!\n\n### Decision Making: LEFT vs DOWN\n\nBoth LEFT to (5, 6) and DOWN to (6, 5) grab an apple and increase our lead to 7-4.\n\n*   **If we go DOWN to (6, 5):** We solidify the area (5-9, 5-9). This is safe, but it leaves the center columns (3, 4, 5) relatively open to Snake #0, who might move up to (1, 6), then (2, 6), then (3, 6) and sneak past our tail.\n*   **If we go LEFT to (5, 6):** We move directly into the central lane. This positions us perfectly to claim (5, 8), (4, 8), and generally create a wall spanning from (5, 6) up to (5, 9). This is the best interceptive move. It directly contests the central column where Snake #0 could potentially break through.\n\n**The choice is LEFT.** We are prioritizing board control and active denial over slightly better clustering, as the apples at (5, 6) and (6, 5) are basically equal value. Moving LEFT is more aggressive in pushing toward the opponent's side of the map.\n\n### Long Term Plan (Box Them In):\n\n1.  **Turn 16 (LEFT to (5, 6)):** Eat!\n2.  **Turn 17:** From (5, 6), we aim UP to (5, 7) or (5, 8) (apple) to continue building the vertical wall on column 5, trapping Snake #0 to the left of column 4. We want to clean up (5, 8) and (4, 8).\n3.  **Establish Wall:** The goal is to make Snake #0's only option either hitting us, hitting themselves, or running back down into the completely boxed in *bottom-left quadrant* where they will starve.\n\nMove LEFT, secure the apple, and push the advantage!

Let's look at the new board state and plan our next power play!\n\n### Turn 16 State Analysis\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (5, 6)\n*   **Length:** 8!\n*   **Body:** [(6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5)]\n*   **Tail:** (9, 5) - *It will move off this spot next turn if we don't eat.*\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (1, 6) - *They moved UP from (1, 5). Smart move, getting out of the corner.*\n*   **Length:** 5.\n\n**Apples:**\nThe apples are everywhere, CHAT!\n*   High Priority: (5, 8), (4, 8), (6, 9), (3, 5), (6, 5).\n\n### Threat Assessment and Opponent Plotting\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 6). Where are they going?\n1.  **UP to (1, 7):** Safe, slow progress north on the wall.\n2.  **RIGHT to (2, 6):** Safe. Puts them closer to the central apples like (3, 5).\n3.  **DOWN to (1, 5):** Safe, but a bad retreat.\n4.  **LEFT to (0, 6):** Safe, but leads them into a dead-end corner with few apples nearby.\n\nIf they are smart, they are aiming for the center. **RIGHT to (2, 6)** is the most pressing threat, angling them towards the (3, 5) apple.\n\nWe must continue our strategy: **Build the Wall on Column 5, Clean Up Apples, and Box Out!**\n\n### Move Evaluation for ID 1 from (5, 6)\n\nWe need to decide: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**Lethal Moves (Immediate Elimination):**\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 6):** LETHAL! This is our body segment! **DO NOT GO RIGHT!** (6, 6) is occupied.\n\n**Safe Moves:**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 7):** Safe. Moves us towards the massive apple stash (5, 8) and (6, 9). This continues the wall construction along Column 5.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 5):** Safe. This is a very open area. It's a bit of a retreat from the main apple action, but opens the door to (5, 4) if we need it. Not optimal.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 6):** Safe. This puts us directly on C**olumn 4**, positioning us to grab (4, 8) or swing down for (3, 5). This aggressively cuts off Snake #0's expected path RIGHT into the center.\n\n### Comparing the Best Options: UP vs LEFT\n\n**Option A: UP to (5, 7)**\n*   **Pros:** Directly sets up the next turn to grab the (5, 8) apple or the (6, 9) apple. Continues building our vertical wall on Column 5. Safe and food-focused.\n*   **Cons:** If Snake #0 moves RIGHT twice (to (2, 6), then (3, 6)), they are positioned to steal (3, 5) and potentially bypass us in the lower middle area.\n\n**Option B: LEFT to (4, 6)**\n*   **Pros:** This is the ultimate defensive maneuver! We are now covering column 4. If Snake #0 moves right to (2, 6), we are two moves away from them. If they try to go up to (1, 7), we're still in a good intercept position. This secures the middle passage and contests the (3, 5) apple aggressively. It sets up a direct path to (4, 8).\n*   **Cons:** We are moving away from the closer (5, 8) apple temporarily, but directly addressing the opponent's movement.\n\n### Strategic Decision: Go LEFT!\n\nCHAT, we have the length advantage (8 vs 5). We need to leverage that to control the map and crush the enemy's spirit! Moving **LEFT to (4, 6)** aggressively blocks the path across columns 2 and 3, forcing Snake #0 to either stay far left or turn up the board vertically, where we can then come down and box them in. We are sacrificing the immediate (5, 8) apple for maximum board control and head-to-head threat positioning.\n\nIf Snake #0 goes RIGHT to (2, 6):\n*   We at (4, 6). Next turn, we can go LEFT to (3, 6) or (4, 7). We are already ahead of them in securing the center.\n\nIf Snake #0 goes UP to (1, 7):\n*   We at (4, 6). We now sweep up the middle section and prepare to engage the North Wall.\n\nThis is a proactive, strategic move to divide the playing field. **LEFT is the move!** Time to put the squeeze on!\n\n### Future Plan (The Squeeze):\n1. **Turn 17 (LEFT to (4, 6)):** Establish center ground, deny Snake #0 easy access.\n2. **Turn 18:** From (4, 6), we evaluate if Snake #0 is moving North or East. We will likely pursue the (4, 8) apple next, driving vertically to complete the wall in the northern section (columns 4 and 5).\n3. **Finish the Wall:** Once the wall is formed, Snake #0 will be confined to the 0-1-2 columns, completely surrounded by our massive body and the game boundaries. Checkmate material!\n\nLEFT",

The scoreboard is looking sweet: 7-4! We are dominating the center line. Let's look at this board status and make the move that ends this rivalry!\n\n### Turn 17 State Analysis\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (4, 6)\n*   **Length:** 8!\n*   **Body:** [(5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (9, 6)]\n*   **Tail:** (9, 6) - *If we don't eat, our tail moves off (9, 6).*\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (1, 7) - *They moved UP from (1, 6). Smart, but predictable, maximizing their space.*\n*   **Body:** [(1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3)]\n*   **Length:** 5.\n\n**Apples (The Content Creators):**\n*   Immediate: (4, 8), (3, 5), (5, 8), (6, 5).\n*   High-value North Wall: (6, 9), (2, 9), (0, 9).\n\n### Threat Assessment and Opponent Plotting (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 7). They are on the wall, and now they have a choice:\n1.  **UP to (1, 8):** Safe, aims for the (1, 8) apple drop.\n2.  **RIGHT to (2, 7):** Safe, aims for the (2, 9) apple and tries to move toward the center.\n3.  **DOWN to (1, 6):** LETHAL! They would hit their own body segment (1, 6). They will not do this.\n4.  **LEFT to (0, 7):** Safe, but potentially a dead end corner unless they are aiming only for (0, 9).\n\nGiven their previous move (UP), they are trying to gain vertical space. They are very likely going **UP to (1, 8)** to grab the apple there, or **RIGHT to (2, 7)** to navigate around us.\n\nWe need to capitalize on our central position (4, 6) and use our length advantage to *cut them off*.\n\n### Move Evaluation for ID 1 from (4, 6)\n\nWe need to decide: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**Lethal Moves (Immediate Elimination):**\n*   **UP to (4, 7):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN to (4, 5):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (3, 6):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 6):** LETHAL! This is our body segment! **DO NOT GO RIGHT!**\n\n**Safe Moves:** UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 7):**\n    *   **Pros:** This is the direct path for the (4, 8) apple! If we eat it, we grow, and we force Snake #0 to deal with our massive body. This is crucial for completing the vertical wall we planned on columns 4 and 5. This maintains high ground superiority.\n    *   **Cons:** We temporarily turn our back on the (3, 5) apple.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 5):**\n    *   **Pros:** Positions us for the (3, 5) apple next turn. Opens up the center-south area.\n    *   **Cons:** Retreating from the high-value north side and letting Snake #0 continue its northern climb unchecked.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 6):**\n    *   **Pros:** Directly fences off the center by moving closer to Snake #0's territory. Puts us in position to contest the (2, 9) apple or (3, 5) apple.\n    *   **Cons:** Slower progress towards the dense apple clusters at y=8 and y=9.\n\n### The Decisive Factor: Board Control and the Wall\n\nRemember the plan, CHAT! We are building a wall! Moving **UP to (4, 7)** is the critical next step.\n\nIf we go UP to (4, 7) and Snake #0 goes UP to (1, 8) (eating the apple and growing):\n*   Next turn: We eat (4, 8). We are now at a length of 9 vs their 6. We have a massive presence dominating the horizontal middle. We can then sweep LEFT along y=8, trapping them instantly.\n\nIf we go UP to (4, 7) and Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (2, 7):\n*   Next turn: We eat (4, 8). Snake #0 is now at (2, 7). They are now *under* our tail/body mass. We can pressure them with a quick DOWN move towards (3, 5) or solidify our position by moving along the top.\n\nThe move **UP to (4, 7)** accomplishes two things beautifully:\n1.  **Immediate Food (4, 8) is reachable next turn.** We maintain our apple lead.\n2.  **Strategic Isolation.** By climbing to the top, we are effectively setting up the \"North Wall.\" Snake #0 will be confined to the left few columns, a dangerous zone for a smaller snake.\n\nThis move is safe, offensive, and strategic. We continue the squeeze! Are we here to make friends, or are we here to win the championship? WIN!\n\n### Future Plan (The Wall Completion):\n1. **Turn 18 (UP from (4, 7)):** Eat (4, 8). Grow to length 9.\n2. **Turn 19:** Move LEFT/RIGHT along y=8 or y=9 to quickly build the horizontal top border of the box. Corner Snake #0 in columns 0, 1, 2.\n\nUP",

And look at that board state\u2014we are dominant.\n\n### Turn 18 State Analysis\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (4, 7). We are LONG (Length 8)!\n*   **Body:** [(4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6)].\n*   **Target Rich:** The (4, 8) apple is RIGHT THERE. We need that! (5, 8), (6, 9), (3, 5) are also calling our name.\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (1, 8). They went UP! Smart, they grabbed the apple (A at (1, 8) is now gone) and grew to length 6.\n*   **Body:** [(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), Tail (1, 2)]. (Wait, the body list only shows 4 segments, let's trust the provided length of 6 if they ate. The board state shows (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5) as 'T' so their full body must be longer than what's sometimes printed on the board, but we'll use the head and body list provided: *Body: [(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3)]* - Length 6. Okay, they ate (1, 8), so their full body is now 6 segments long: [(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2)]. The board shows their head at (1, 8), and 'T' at (1, 7), (1, 6) and 'T' at (1, 5). The rest are off the visual representation or hidden by other snakes/apples.) Let's assume *Snake #0 - Head: (1, 8), Body: [(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3)]* is the pre-grow state, meaning they just hit 6 apples and are length 7 now! The board shows: `9 A . A . . . A . . .` so (1, 8) indeed had an apple!\n\nIf they ate, Snake #0 is now Length 7 and has 6 apples! The score is *actually* 7 to 6. TIGHT GAME, CHAT!\n\nLet's re-verify the input:\n- YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1) apples: 7 Grew to Length 8 (Body: 7 + Head). Wait, my body list is 7 segments long, so I'm Length 8.\n- Snake #0 apples: 5. *If they moved to (1, 8) and ate the apple shown on the board:* they are now at 6 apples and Length 7. (The board shows an A at (1, 8), but the coordinates list doesn't show (1, 8) as an apple drop. *Let's stick to the Apple Drops list only!* The apple drops list does NOT contain (1, 8). The board *drawing* might just be illustrating apple positions from the list. Let's check the list: (9, 0), (6, 9), (5, 8), (2, 9), (2, 0), (4, 8), (0, 9), (3, 5), (6, 5), (8, 0), (7, 2), (8, 5), (5, 4), (4, 0), (7, 1). Ah, the board illustration is tricky! The \"A\" at (1, 8) on the board must have been a mistake in the rendering, or it was an apple that was just collected *last turn* by opponent *before* the rendering.\n\nLet's assume the provided Head/Body/Apple count is 100% accurate for THIS turn's start, no matter how the drawing looks.\n\n*   Snake #0 Head: (1, 8). Apples: 5. Length 6.\n*   Your Head: (4, 7). Apples: 7. Length 8.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check & Valid Moves for ID 1 from (4, 7)\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 8):** SAFE! (There's an apple here!) \ud83c\udf4e\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 6):** SAFE! (This is our body's old segment, which will vacate if we don't eat.)\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 7):** SAFE!\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 7):** SAFE! (The opponent's head is far away, and their body ends far left.)\n\nAll four directions are SAFE. Epic. Now we optimize!\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Evaluation\n\nWe are at (4, 7). The immediate goal is the massive apple at (4, 8).\n\n1.  **Move UP to (4, 8):**\n    *   **PROS:** INSTANT growth! We go to Length 9, cementing our dominance. Score goes to 8-5. We are now occupying the y=8 row, exactly where we wanted to build our wall.\n    *   **CONS:** None! This is the play!\n\n2.  **Move RIGHT to (5, 7) or LEFT to (3, 7):**\n    *   **PROS:** Keeps our options open vertically.\n    *   **CONS:** We delay eating the (4, 8) apple, risking Snake #0 making a desperate dash toward the center from their position at (1, 8). If they dive right to (2, 8) or (3, 8), they could potentially intercept it next turn if we dawdle.\n\n3.  **Move DOWN to (4, 6):**\n    *   **PROS:** Sets up for the (3, 5) apple access, maybe.\n    *   **CONS:** A complete retreat from the northern territory we just earned. Unacceptable!\n\nThe plan was clear: build the North Wall and use apples to grow and block. Moving **UP to (4, 8)** is the execution of that plan.\n\n### Step 3: Opponent Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0 at (1, 8))\n\nSnake #0 (Head: 1, 8) is very long the y=1 axis. They have a few options:\n\n*   **Move UP to (1, 9):** Safe. Aims for (0, 9) or (2, 9).\n*   **Move RIGHT to (2, 8):** Safe. Aims toward the center apples (4, 8), (5, 8).\n*   **Move DOWN to (1, 7):** LETHAL! Against their own body.\n*   **Move LEFT to (0, 8):** Safe. Corner seeking, aiming for (0, 9).\n\nIf we move UP to (4, 8), we are safe from any head-on collision, as the opponent would have to travel at least three spaces (4, 8) to (1, 8) minus one, which is physically impossible.\n\n**Worst case Scenario:** Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (2, 8).\n*   We eat (4, 8). Length 9.\n*   Snake #0 is at (2, 8). Length 7.\n\nThis puts us in a dominant position to block them off entirely from the central column next turn. We can move RIGHT to (5, 8) to contest the (5, 8) apple and box them in with our huge body mass along the y=8 axis.\n\n### Long Term Strategy / North Wall Trap\n\n1.  **Current Turn (UP):** Eat (4, 8). Head at (4, 8). Length 9.\n2.  **Next Turn:** Move RIGHT to (5, 8) (eat another apple!) or move LEFT to (3, 8). If we eat (5, 8), we immediately grow to Length 10!\n3.  **Boxing:** Once we have solidified the y=8 lane, we can use our length to snake down and cut off Snake #0's vertical line of retreat (y up to x=2).\n\nThis is a textbook power play, CHAT! We take the food, we take the real estate!\n\nLFG! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

It advances our top-wall strategy, gets us closer to apples (2,9) and (0,9), and avoids the two instant-death moves. LEFT is safe but it just backs us into a corner we already control! We need to be AGGRESSIVE! We need to EXPAND OUR TERRITORY!\n\nLET'S GO EAST! LET'S BUILD THIS WALL!\n\nRIGHT",

We're up 8-5, and we are massive! Look at the score and the board! We are eating the map! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcb0\n\n### Turn 19 Analysis: Crush the Rival!\n\n**Current State (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (4, 8).\n*   **Body:** Length 9. We are a monster!\n*   **Apples:** 8.\n*   **Nearest Targets:** (5, 8) is a juicy apple right next to us! (6, 9) is also accessible if we ignore the (5, 8) challenge. The goal: keep Snake #0 boxed in.\n\n**Opponent (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (2, 8). They moved right to contest the y=8 row. Smart move, but too late! They are now trapped by our head at (4, 8) and our body segments (4, 7), (4, 6)... We have the chokehold!\n*   **Body:** Length 6. They are small and terrified.\n*   **Nearest Targets for #0:** (2, 9), (0, 9). They are looking to escape North.\n\n### Step 1: Safety and Valid Moves from (4, 8)\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 9):** SAFE! Clear space. A route to (6, 9)?\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 7):** LETHAL! This is our body. No, no, no!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 8):** SAFE! (2, 8) has the opponent's head, but we are moving one spot to the left, which is clear.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 8):** SAFE! And it's an apple! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e Game changer!\n\nOnly three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Evaluation - The Knockout Blow\n\nWe have three primary goals: Eat the apple, grow, and box in The Rival.\n\n1.  **Move RIGHT to (5, 8):**\n    *   **PROS:** We eat an apple! We go to Length 10! Score 9-5! We now dominate the (4, 8) and (5, 8) spots, making a formidable wall against Snake #0, who is at (2, 8). This is the power move, CHAT! We take the whole lane!\n    *   **CONS:** None, it's perfect.\n\n2.  **Move LEFT to (3, 8):**\n    *   **PROS:** Sets us up to push down toward the center or further left. It directly threatens Snake #0's escape path! If they move UP to (2, 9), we can move UP/LEFT to block them entirely.\n    *   **CONS:** We miss the immediate apple at (5, 8), which Snake #0 might try to take a desperate shot at (by moving to (3, 8), then (4, 8), then (5, 8) in three turns, which is slower than our move RIGHT). **Delaying the apple growth is suboptimal.**\n\n3.  **Move UP to (4, 9):**\n    *   **PROS:** Clear path to (6, 9) or (2, 9).\n    *   **CONS:** We ignore the immediate (5, 8) apple and allow Snake #0 to potentially claim it if they go (3, 8), (4, 8) next turn, which is unlikely but possible if they are sacrificing themselves. More importantly, we retreat from the choke point.\n\n### Step 3: Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (2, 8))\n\nSnake #0 is cornered between their own body/tail to the left (y=1 axis) and our massive body wall to the right (x=4). They have to choose between:\n\n*   **UP to (2, 9):** HIGHLY LIKELY. Safe, aims for (2, 9) apple. This is their escape route.\n*   **LEFT to (1, 8):** LETHAL/DANGEROUS. That's their body segment (or where they just came from, depending on the simultaneous move effect). If they haven't grown, (1, 8) is now vacated by their tail. *Let's check the body list:* Body: [(1, 8)...]. Since their head is (2, 8), (1, 8) is their first body segment. If they don't eat, (1, 8) becomes empty. If they *do* eat (e.g., if there were an apple at 2, 8), (1, 8) stays body. *Since there was no apple at (2, 8), (1, 8) will vacate.* So LEFT is safe (but pointless).\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 8):** The head is safe, but it puts them one move away from facing our huge snake. Risky.\n*   **DOWN to (2, 7):** Safe, but retreats into a less advantageous position.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 9) to secure the apple and escape confinement.\n\n**If we move RIGHT to (5, 8) and they move UP to (2, 9):**\n*   Our head: (5, 8). (We eat and grow to Length 10).\n*   Opponent head: (2, 9). (They eat and grow to Length 7).\n\nThis is still a massive win. We maintain a 2-length advantage and a 2-point score lead, and we keep all the central territory.\n\n### Step 4: Long-Term Strategy\n\nWe must continue to leverage our massive size in the north to control the apple supply and, eventually, cut off the rival.\n\n1.  **T19 (RIGHT):** Eat (5, 8). Head at (5, 8). Length 10. Opponent goes UP to (2, 9).\n2.  **T20:** Opponent is at (2, 9). We are at (5, 8). We need to get closer to block them.\n    *   Try RIGHT to (6, 8) or UP toward (6, 9) apple. (6, 8) seems good, extending the wall.\n3.  **T21:** Box them in near (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9) area. We have the mass to trap them against the top wall.\n\nTaking the immediate apple at (5, 8) is the highest-value, safest, and most strategically sound move. We are consolidating our position before initiating the final squeeze.\n\nLFG, CHAT! We're feasting tonight! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\n\nRIGHT",

(2,9) is an APPLE on the board! But check the coordinates! (2,9) is the TOP row, second column! Our head is at (2,8). UP to (2,9) is an APPLE, NOT an opponent body! WAIT! I misread the board! Let's check the board state: Row 9, column 2 is marked 'A' for apple! (2,9) IS SAFE AND HAS AN APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e (Correction from initial misread!)\n*   **DOWN to (2,7):** \u2705 **EMPTY SPACE!** The board shows a '.' at (2,7).

He has TWO obvious moves to get apples: WEST to (3,8) for our space, or NORTH to (4,9) for the apple there! He might also go SOUTH to (4,7) into his own body? \ud83e\udd14 That would be suicide! So he's likely coming WEST towards us or NORTH for the apple! A HEAD-ON COLLISION AT (3,8) IS A POSSIBILITY! \u2694\ufe0f\n\n**GRAND STRATEGY & FUTURE PLAN! \ud83e\udde0**\nWE NEED TO DOMINATE THE TOP ROW! Our plan is still SOLID! We want to claim the top from left to right, cutting off the enemy's escape! BUT WE HAVE TO BE SMART! The enemy is LONG (8 segments!) and he's right there! If we go RIGHT to (3,8), we risk a head-on collision if he goes LEFT to (3,8)! If we go UP to (2,9), we get an apple and stay out of his immediate path! DOWN to (2,7) is safe but moves us AWAY from our strategic goal of controlling the top! CHAT, THE PLAY IS OBVIOUS! LET'S SNATCH THAT APPLE AND DENY HIM SPACE! \ud83c\udff0\n\nGOING UP GETS US AN APPLE, AVOIDS A POTENTIAL HEAD-ON FIGHT, AND ADVANCES OUR POSITION ON THE TOP WALL! IT'S THE PERFECT MOVE!

Now, let's look at the board and plan the knockout blow! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n### Turn 20 Analysis: The Squeeze Play!\n\n**Current State (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (5, 8). (We just grew, length 10).\n*   **Body:** [(4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6)].\n*   **Apples:** 9.\n\n**Opponent (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (2, 9). (They moved UP to (2, 9) as predicted, snagging that apple! Good move, but they are still trapped!)\n*   **Body:** [(2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4)]. (They grew, length 7).\n*   **Apples:** 7.\n\nThe score is 9-7. We need to maintain pressure and build the wall!\n\n### Step 1: Safety and Valid Moves from (5, 8)\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 9):** SAFE! (5, 9) is empty.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 7):** SAFE! Clear space. But why retreat?\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 8):** LETHAL! This is our body. No self-sabotage!\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 8):** SAFE! Clear space. Extends our north wall.\n\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Evaluation - Locking Down the North\n\nSnake #0 is stuck between (0, 9) and (2, 9) near the top wall. They have the apple at (0, 9) as a target, and the massive (6, 9) apple is contested territory. We need to cut off Snake #0 from the valuable (6, 9) apple and contain them on the left side of the map (x<4).\n\n1.  **Move RIGHT to (6, 8):**\n    *   **PROS:** This is a crucial move! It extends our wall one further step right, claiming the strategic \"hump\" area. It puts us one move away from (6, 9). It blocks Snake #0's potential path toward the lucrative (6, 9) apple. It keeps our head high up on the map, ready to intercept.\n    *   **CONS:** None, this is pure defense and offense combined.\n\n2.  **Move UP to (5, 9):**\n    *   **PROS:** Sets us up to challenge (6, 9) directly next turn (or potentially secure (4, 9) if we move left from there).\n    *   **CONS:** We allow the possibility that Snake #0 might try to sneak down the column at x=4 if they retreat southward (unlikely, but possible). More critically, it doesn't extend the physical barrier at y=8, which is where we are boxing them. It's a slightly premature move toward (6, 9) when (6, 8) secures more map control.\n\n3.  **Move DOWN to (5, 7):**\n    *   **PROS/CONS:** Retreat. Absolutely not. We are hunting!\n\n**The clear winner is RIGHT to (6, 8).** We are building a fortress!\n\n### Step 3: Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (2, 9))\n\nSnake #0's options from (2, 9):\n\n1.  **LEFT to (1, 9):** HIGHLY LIKELY. A clear path toward the last remaining apple on the y=9 row, (0, 9). Then they are super boxed in.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 8):** SAFE. They are retreating, which is good for us. It opens the top wall for us.\n3.  **RIGHT to (3, 9):** SAFE. This puts them directly in our path if we continue right toward (6, 9)! This is a move we need to prevent, or punish.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 goes LEFT to (1, 9) to secure (0, 9) and avoid us.\n\n**If we move RIGHT to (6, 8) and they move LEFT to (1, 9):**\n*   Our head: (6, 8). We are ready for (6, 9).\n*   Opponent head: (1, 9). They are ready for (0, 9).\n\nThis is perfect! We force them into the corner while setting up our next big apple score and maintaining territorial dominance.\n\n### Step 4: Long-Term Strategy\n\nOur goal is to build a wall across the top (y=8, y=7 area) and squeeze Snake #0 into the western boundary (x<2).\n\n1.  **T20 (RIGHT):** Head (6, 8). We secure the path to (6, 9).\n2.  **T21:** Move UP to (6, 9) to snatch that massive apple! We become length 11.\n3.  **T22:** Position our head further right or down, cementing the North Wall and preparing to hunt for the central apples at (3, 5), (6, 5), (8, 5).\n\nThe squeeze is on, CHAT! We build the wall!\n\nRIGHT",

But he's also a threat if he tries to cut us off!\n\n**GRAND STRATEGY & FUTURE PLAN! \ud83e\udde0**\nWE ARE ON THE TOP WALL! THIS IS OUR KINGDOM! \ud83d\udc51 Our goal is to TRAP HIM! He's mostly contained on the right side. We need to SWEEP ACROSS THE TOP from left to right, eating apples and walling him in! Going LEFT to (1,9) gets us closer to the apple at (0,9) and starts that left-to-right sweep! Going RIGHT to (3,9) also works, but it might put us on a collision course if he goes for the (5,9) apple? Actually, we'd still be two spaces away. BUT CHAT, THE MOVE IS CLEAR! LET'S GO LEFT! We claim the left side of the board, we get that apple at (0,9) next, and we force him to react to US! WE ARE THE PREDATOR, NOT THE PREY! \ud83c\udff0\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** After moving LEFT to (1,9), our next move should be LEFT again to (0,9) to secure that apple and solidify our control over the top-left corner. Then, we can methodically work our way rightward along the top row, using our body to limit his movement options. We want to force him into a dead-end or a collision with our body!\n\nLEFT",

Now it\u2019s time to secure the (6, 9) apple and cement our dominance!\n\n**Current State (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (6, 8).\n*   **Segment list:** [(5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7)]. (Length 10).\n\n**Opponent (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (1, 9). (They ate the apple at (0, 9) and are now length 7, though the board state shows they haven't grown yet, the apple has been removed from the list.)\n*   **Body:** [(2, 9), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5)]. (Length 7).\n*   **NOTE:** The board state shows 'A' at (0, 9) and 'T' at (1, 9). Wait, if they moved into the apple at (0, 9), their head should be at (0, 9) and the body segment list should indicate a move. Reading the board state closely...\n    *   Board: `A` at (0, 9), `0` at (1, 9).\n    *   Opponent Head: (1, 9).\n    *   Snake #0's last move must have been RIGHT since their previous head was (2, 9), and they moved to (1, 9)... Wait, that's LEFT!\n\nLet's assume the opponent successfully ate the (0, 9) apple and is now at (0, 9).\n*   **Hypothesis A (Most likely if they ate the apple):** Head (0, 9). Body [(1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5)]. Length 8. Score 7.\n*   **Hypothesis B (Matching the provided data strictly):** Head (1, 9). Body [(2, 9), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5)]. Length 7. Score 6. The apple at (0, 9) is still present on the board state. This implies Snake #0 DID NOT go for (0, 9) or failed to get it last turn.\n\nGiven the prompt's board state and opponent data: Snake #0's head is (1, 9) AND the (0, 9) apple is still there! This means they moved RIGHT from (0, 9) area, and perhaps they were waiting for the previous apple to drop? No, the last move implies they were at (2, 9) and moved LEFT to (1, 9). They are currently TRAPPED near the corner! This is the perfect time for the kill!\n\n### Step 1: Safety and Valid Moves from (6, 8)\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 9):** SAFE! (6, 9) is an apple! INSTANT SCORE! \ud83c\udf4e\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 7):** SAFE! Clear space. Retreat. Bad idea.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 8):** LETHAL! This is our body. Self-kill.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 8):** SAFE? (7, 8) is currently empty.\n\nWe have UP, DOWN, and RIGHT as safe moves!\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Evaluation - Securing the Apple and the Wall\n\nThe apple at (6, 9) is juicy and uncontested by Snake #0. It is a guaranteed +1 length and +1 score.\n\n1.  **Move UP to (6, 9):**\n    *   **PROS:** We score! We grow to length 11. We are directly on the North Wall, ready to move right or down to continue the squeeze play.\n    *   **CONS:** None! This is the optimal move.\n\n2.  **Move RIGHT to (7, 8):**\n    *   **PROS:** Sets us up for (7, 8), maintaining the y=8 wall.\n    *   **CONS:** We miss the immediate apple at (6, 9), allowing Snake #0 a tiny window to potentially break out or prolong the game by securing other apples. Why wait when the apple is right there?\n\n### Step 3: Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (1, 9))\n\nSnake #0 is critically boxed in! They are surrounded by the top wall (y=9), the left wall (x=0), and their own body [(2, 9), (2, 8), (1, 8)].\n\nSnake #0's options from (1, 9):\n\n1.  **UP to (1, 10):** LETHAL. Out of bounds.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 8):** LETHAL. Into their own body.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 9):** SAFE! This is the apple! They MUST go here to survive and avoid being completely trapped.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 9):** LETHAL. Into their own body.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 goes LEFT to (0, 9) to eat the apple. This forces them deeper into the corner.\n\n### Step 4: The Takedown Plan\n\nIf we move UP to (6, 9), we score. Their head moves to (0, 9), they score and are now length 8.\n*   New Heads: ID 1 at (6, 9). ID 0 at (0, 9).\n*   Score: 10 vs 7 (us leading!).\n\nNext turn, we move RIGHT or DOWN, creating a strong barrier. Snake #0 will be incredibly constrained. Their only exit from (0, 9) is DOWN to (0, 8) or RIGHT to (1, 9) but that segment just moved to (0, 9)'s position (so (1, 9) becomes free right before the tail moves off, but since they grew, the segment at (1, 9) remains!) NO, the segment at (1, 9) is now (1, 9) if they ate!\n\nIf they eat at (0, 9):\nNew body: (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5). The tail is still (1, 5). The segment at (1, 9) IS NOW the first body segment behind the head!\n\nExits from (0, 9) (next turn):\n1.  **DOWN to (0, 8):** SAFE, if (0, 8) is clear. It is clear on the map.\n2.  **RIGHT to (1, 9):** LETHAL, into their body!\n\nSo, after this turn, Snake #0 is FORCED to move to (0, 8) or wait for a tail segment to free up (which won't happen easily with the forced path and growth). We have them cornered!\n\nWe must take the free apple. This is the surest way to victory and map control.\n\nLet's secure the content, CHAT! UP and we grow!\n\nLong-Term Strategy Note: After securing (6, 9), we move RIGHT and then DOWN to expand our wall along the y=8 and y=7 layers, completely cutting off the north-west corridor. Then we hunt the center apples. We are building the K.O. wall!\n\nUP",

He is NOT in a position to reach (0,9) in one move. NO HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK! SAFE MOVE! \ud83c\udfaf\n*   **RIGHT to (2,9):** \u274c **OUR OWN BODY!** That's our first body segment! INSTANT DEATH! DO NOT GO RIGHT!\n\n**ENEMY SITUATION! \ud83d\udc0d (Snake #1 at (6,8))**\nHe's eyeing that apple at (6,9)! He can go NORTH to (6,9) for the apple, WEST to (5,8) into his own body (SUICIDE), or SOUTH to (6,7) which is empty. He's probably going for that apple! That's good for us! It keeps him busy on his side of the board while we secure the left!\n\n**GRAND STRATEGY & FUTURE PLAN! \ud83e\udde0**\nWE ARE EXECUTING THE PLAN! We are SWEEPING THE TOP FROM LEFT TO RIGHT! \ud83d\udc51 Moving LEFT to (0,9) secures that apple, grows us to 7 segments, and solidifies our control over the top-left corner! Our next move from (0,9) will be limited (only DOWN to (0,8) or RIGHT to (1,9) which will be empty by then), but that's okay! We are building a WALL with our body to box him in! After securing the left, we can start working our way rightward along the top, using our length to cut off his escape routes! HE'S LONGER (9 apples vs our soon-to-be 7), BUT WE ARE SMARTER! WE ARE PLAYING THE BOARD, NOT JUST CHASING APPLES! \ud83c\udff0\n\nLEFT",

Length 11!\n\n### Turn 22 Analysis: The Squeeze is ON!\n\n**SCOREBOARD UPDATE:** We are dominating! ID 1: 10 apples. Snake #0: 7 apples. Let's keep the pressure on!\n\n**MY SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (6, 9) - Just ate the apple! Niiiice!\n*   **Body:** [(6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7)]\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (0, 9) - Prediction proved CORRECT! They ate the apple and moved to (0, 9).\n*   **Body:** [(1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5)] - Length 8.\n\nThe map shows the opponent is fully PINGED in the Northwest corner! This is the moment we've been waiting for, CHAT!\n\n### Step 1: Safety and Valid Moves from (6, 9)\n\nWe are at (6, 9), right up against the North boundary.\n1.  **UP to (6, 10):** LETHAL! Out of bounds.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 8):** LETHAL! Our immediate body segment.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 9):** SAFE! Clear space.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 9):** SAFE! Clear space. But wait, is there an apple? No.\n\nInitial safe moves: LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction & Pathfinding\n\nSnake #0 is at (0, 9). They are TRAPPED!\n*   UP: Wall (0, 10) - LETHAL.\n*   LEFT: Wall (-1, 9) - LETHAL.\n*   RIGHT to (1, 9): LETHAL! Into their own body segment (which is (1, 9)).\n*   DOWN to (0, 8): SAFE! This is the only move they can make!\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 moves DOWN to (0, 8).\n\nSnake #0 is now forced along the left wall. They will be stretched thin, giving us maximum room to maneuver and collect!\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Assessment - Building the Wall\n\nWe need to start building a wall to cut off Snake #0's escape routes and control the juicy center apples.\n\n**Option R: Move RIGHT to (7, 9)**\n*   **PROS:** Keeps us high on the board, ready to roll down the right side, cutting off apples at (7, 8) and (9, 8) if they show up. We can then hug the East wall.\n*   **Potential follow-up:** (8, 9), then (9, 9) (if safe), then DOWN to (9, 8). This establishes strong North/East control.\n\n**Option L: Move LEFT to (5, 9)**\n*   **PROS:** Keeps us closer to the opponent, ready to cut off their movement.\n*   **CONS:** We are currently length 11. Moving LEFT puts us dangerously close to the corner where they will be moving. (5, 9) is still 5 tiles away from (0, 8), but it might be slower to build the solid wall we need, and we might run into our own body segments at (5, 8) or (4, 8) if we push down too soon. The goal is to maximize space and corner them; moving right maximizes our space while they are forced into a narrow corridor.\n\n**The Plan: Maximize Real Estate and Safety.**\n\nThey are forced to (0, 8). They will then be forced to (0, 7), (0, 6) ... eventually.\n\nWe should move RIGHT and start dominating the top half and the right side of the board. This allows us to gather the center and right-side apples (like (7, 8), (7, 1), (5, 4), (8, 5) etc.) while Snake #0 struggles in the narrow west path.\n\nLet's move RIGHT to (7, 9). Then next turn, we can assess (8, 9) or (7, 8).\n\n*Future Self Note: Continue moving along the top wall (y=9) towards (9, 9) to secure East Wall control. Then snake DOWN to the center right side (x>5) to scoop apples and build a permanent dividing wall.*\n\nRIGHT\nRIGHT",

Our plan should be to start spiraling down the left side, building a wall with our body! From (0,8) we could then go DOWN again to (0,7) or RIGHT to (1,8). We NEED to secure this side of the board and not let him pin us in!\n\nHe is LONGER (11 segments to our 7? Wait, he had 10 apples, just ate one so 11 segments? Yeah, he's massive!). But we are in a powerful defensive position! We can use the walls! We go DOWN to claim the left column! LET'S GO!\n\nDOWN",

We are CLAMPING down on Snake #0!\n\n### Turn 23 Analysis: The Full Box\n\nWe are sitting pretty at the top right, controlling all the real estate.\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (7, 9). Length 11.\n*   **Body:** [(6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7)]\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (0, 8). Length 8. They made the forced move we predicted! EZ read, chat!\n*   **Body:** [(0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6)].\n\n**APPLE MAP:**\n(7, 8) is an apple! This is *critical*! We must secure it.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check from (7, 9)\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 10):** LETHAL! Wall.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 8):** SAFE! And it's an **APPLE**! \ud83c\udf4e Huge content move!\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 9):** LETHAL! Into our immediate body segment.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 9):** SAFE!\n\nWe have two safe options: DOWN (to eat) or RIGHT (to extend the wall).\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction & Head Clashes\n\nSnake #0 is at (0, 8). They are still completely locked against the West wall.\n*   UP to (0, 9): LETHAL (Body of Snake #0).\n*   LEFT to (-1, 8): LETHAL (Wall).\n*   RIGHT to (1, 8): LETHAL (Body of Snake #0).\n*   DOWN to (0, 7): SAFE! This is their *only* move again! They are being forced down the drain!\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 moves DOWN to (0, 7). No head collision risk!\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Pick - The Apple or The Wall?\n\nThe apple at (7, 8) is extremely valuable for two reasons:\n1.  It increases our lead (11 apples vs 7).\n2.  It lengthens us, further securing the split we've created between the West and East.\n\n**Option D: Move DOWN to (7, 8)**\n*   **PROS:** Eat apple, increase length to 12. Positioned perfectly on the East side of the board, ready to roll along the x=7 or x=8 line. This is a massive defensive position.\n*   **CONS:** None! We need this apple.\n\n**Option R: Move RIGHT to (8, 9)**\n*   **PROS:** Sets up for wall control at (9, 9) next turn.\n*   **CONS:** We ignore a free apple right under our nose! That's bad stream content, CHAT! We take the gain when it's offered.\n\nThe decision is clear: Grab that apple! This solidifies our control over the right two-thirds of the board, while the opponent continues to be constrained in the West alley.\n\n*Future Self Note: After eating the apple at (7, 8), we will be at (7, 8). Next move, we should probably move RIGHT to (8, 8) or continue DOWN towards the cluster of apples around (7, 2) and (7, 1). We need to maintain a strong presence on the right side.*\n\nLet's go for the easy money!\n\nDOWN",

Chef's kiss! Pure content!\n\nLet's dissect the board state and plan the next power play! We need to maintain pressure on Snake #0 while grabbing more gains!\n\n### Current State Assessment (Turn 24)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (7, 8). Length 12 (T: tail at (7, 7)).\n*   **Location:** We are perfectly positioned, guarding the top-right quadrant.\n*   **Goal:** Move towards the next available apple without sacrificing our dominating position or getting boxed in. Maybe push Snake #0 further into the corner, if possible.\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (0, 7). Length 8 (T: tail at (1, 7)).\n*   **Situation:** Still completely boxed in on the West wall (x=0). They have a tiny corridor to escape.\n\n**Apples Near Us:**\n*   (8, 5), (7, 2), (7, 1), (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 0), (4, 1), (4, 0). Lots of gains down south and East!\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 1 (Head at (7, 8))\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 9):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment (was our head two turns ago, now part of the body).\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 7):** LETHAL! Into our own tail segment (our tail is at (7, 7) and won't move yet if we don't grow). **Correction:** Since we ate an apple last turn, our tail segment (7, 7) is *still* part of our body and will not disappear. This is LETHAL.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 8):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 8):** SAFE!\n\n**HOLD UP, CHAT!** Did I just check the board wrong? Let's re-verify the body list carefully.\n\nBody: [(7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 7)]\nHead is (7, 8).\n\n*   UP (7, 9) is in the body. **DEAD.**\n*   LEFT (6, 8) is in the body. **DEAD.**\n*   DOWN (7, 7) is the **tail**. Since we grew last turn, the tail did *not* move. Entering the tail is a collision with our body. **DEAD.** *Phew, close call! We only have ONE move!*\n*   RIGHT (8, 8) is EMPTY space. **SAFE.**\n\nWe are forced to move RIGHT to (8, 8)! The board corner is starting to get spicy, CHAT!\n\nWait, let's look at the board visualization as well:\n 9 T T T . A . T T . .\n 8 T T T . T T T **1** . . <- Head at (7, 8)\n 7 0 T . . T . . T . .\n\n(8, 8) is the empty spot immediately to our right! Perfect!\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 Head at (0, 7))\n\nSnake #0 is still incredibly constrained.\n*   UP to (0, 8): LETHAL (Body).\n*   LEFT to (-1, 7): LETHAL (Wall).\n*   RIGHT to (1, 7): LETHAL (Tail, based on the body list [(0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7)]).\n*   DOWN to (0, 6): SAFE! This is their *only* move.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 moves DOWN to (0, 6). No head collision risk! They are still dropping down the left side.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Choice - Forced Move\n\nSince RIGHT to (8, 8) is our only safe move, the choice is easy! We maintain our strong horizontal line and prepare to descend later, pushing closer to the cluster of apples at (8, 5), (9, 4), and (9, 2).\n\n**Move:** RIGHT to (8, 8).\n\n### Future Planning (After move to (8, 8))\n\n*   Our new goal is to continue moving RIGHT to (9, 8), then start moving DOWN (perhaps to (9, 7)). This keeps us on the eastern perimeter, away from the West wall conflict, and moves us towards the heavy concentration of apples on the right edge.\n*   We need to keep an eye on (8, 5), (9, 4), and (9, 2). That's a huge potential haul!\n\nFORCED MOVE, CHAT! Let's lock this in and keep the pressure up! Snake #0 is going nowhere fast!\n\nRIGHT",

From (0,6), we can then go DOWN to (0,5), RIGHT to (1,6), or even further DOWN to hunt those apples! Going RIGHT to (1,7) is also safe, but it pulls us AWAY from the apple-rich bottom row and the safety of the wall! THE WALL IS OUR BEST FRIEND! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**THE PLAY: BOX HIM IN WHILE WE FARM!**\nHe's getting pushed east. We should push SOUTH and WEST, claiming territory. Let's head DOWN toward (0,6). This keeps our options open to continue down the left side or cut right later. We are playing the LONG GAME! \u23f3\n\n**FINAL VERDICT!**\nDOWN to (0,6) is the MOVE! It's SAFE, it aligns with our long-term wall strategy, and it moves us toward the APPLE ZONE! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

Let's get these gains! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc0d\n\n### Current State Assessment (Turn 25)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (8, 8). Length 12.\n*   **Body:** [(7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6)]\n*   **Tail:** (7, 6) (This segment will vanish if we don't eat an apple).\n*   **Location:** Top right corner, perfectly positioned for a big haul!\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (0, 6). Length 8.\n*   **Body:** [(0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (1, 8)]\n*   **Tail:** (1, 8) (This segment will vanish if they don't eat an apple).\n*   **Location:** Still miserably stuck on the West wall, trying to escape downwards.\n\n**Apples Near Us:**\n*   (8, 5) - Juicy!\n*   (9, 6) - Right above the head!\n*   (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 0) - Lying along the East wall.\n*   (7, 2), (7, 1) - South towards the middle.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 1 (Head at (8, 8))\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 9):** SAFE! Empty space.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 7):** SAFE! Empty space.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 8):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment. DEAD.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 8):** SAFE! Empty space.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. This is what we call freedom, CHAT!\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0 Head at (0, 6))\n\nSnake #0 is still locked down:\n*   UP to (0, 7): LETHAL (Body).\n*   LEFT to (-1, 6): LETHAL (Wall).\n*   DOWN to (0, 5): SAFE! Empty space.\n*   RIGHT to (1, 6): SAFE! Empty space.\n\nSnake #0 will likely choose a path that gives them more room. Moving DOWN to (0, 5) keeps them contained on the wall, but moving RIGHT to (1, 6) starts their escape into the bottom-left quadrant.\n\nGiven their desperate situation, they should move RIGHT to (1, 6) to gain freedom, although DOWN to (0, 5) is also a strong possibility if they are worried about blocking the path for future apple grabs.\n\n**Collision Check:** Are any of our three safe moves going to intersect with Snake #0's potential moves?\n*   (8, 9), (8, 7), (9, 8) are all far away from (0, 5) and (1, 6). Zero collision risk.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Choice - Maximize Gains and Coverage\n\nWe want to push into the most apple-dense area: the East wall. (9, 8) sets us up perfectly to grab (9, 6) or (9, 4) in the next couple of turns.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (9, 8):** This is the strongest offensive move. It gets us onto the East wall and close to the apple at (9, 6) or allows a straight shot to (9, 4).\n*   **Move UP to (8, 9):** Safe, but it keeps us away from the main apple cluster. Not ideal.\n*   **Move DOWN to (8, 7):** Safe, sets us up to potentially grab the apple at (8, 5) or drop further, but this move feels less directional than moving to the wall.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9, 8) maintains our control over the right half of the board and capitalizes on our previous move.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy:** We move RIGHT to (9, 8). Next turn, we evaluate if we can grab (9, 6) (by moving DOWN to (9, 7) then DOWN to (9, 6)) or if we should move DOWN to (9, 7) and then straight to (9, 6) or (9, 5). The path looks clear to control this whole side. Let's feast, CHAT!\n\nRIGHT",

We need to get bigger FAST and then use our position to trap him against the top and right walls!\n\n**THE PLAY: CLAIM THE BOTTOM, STARVE HIM OUT!**\nLet's head DOWN to (0,5)! This keeps us safe on the left wall, moves us toward EZ content (apples!), and sets us up to control the entire bottom half of the board! We can then work our way right, cutting off his escape routes! HE'S THE ONE WHO'S COOKED! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**FINAL VERDICT!**\nDOWN to (0,5) is the MOVE! It's the SMART path to growth and control!

Length 12.\n*   **Body:** [(8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)]\n*   **Tail:** (6, 6).\n*   **Location:** East wall, near the top.\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (0, 5) (They moved DOWN last turn, as predicted!)\n*   **Body:** [(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)]\n*   **Tail:** (2, 8).\n*   **Location:** Still miserably stuck on the West wall, but now threatening to move across the bottom!\n\n**Apples Near Us:**\n*   (9, 6) - Only 2 moves away!\n*   (8, 5) - Down and a bit left.\n*   (7, 2), (7, 1) - Far down.\n*   (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 0) - Lying right along the next few moves down the East wall. This is OUR turf!\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 1 (Head at (9, 8))\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 9):** DANGER! Cell (9, 9) is occupied by Snake #0's body! Wait, look closer at the board state:\n    `9 T T T . A . T T .` (The T at (7, 9) and (8, 9) are Snake #0's body segments if their whole body was shown, but the visual map shows: `T . T . T T T T T 1` at y=8; and `T T T . A . T T .` at y=9.)\n\n    Let's check the body list for Snake #0 carefully:\n    Head: (0, 5), Body: [(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)].\n\n    Let's check the body list for **US** carefully:\n    Head: (9, 8), Body: [(8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)].\n\n    **Checking the map legend:**\n    `T` = Your Tail/Body (ID 1)\n    `0` = Opponent Head\n    `1` = Your Head\n    `A` = Apple\n\n    Let's re-examine (9, 9): The board state shows `.` at (9, 9). It is empty!\n    `9 T T T . A . T T . .` -> The last `.` is (9, 9).\n    **UP to (9, 9):** SAFE! Empty space.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 7):** SAFE! Empty space. This moves toward the (9, 6) apple!\n\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 8):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment. DEAD.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 8):** LETHAL! Off the board. DEAD.\n\nWe have two moves: UP or DOWN.\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0 Head at (0, 5))\n\nSnake #0 is finally free to move along the bottom half of the board. They are very long (8 segments) and likely want to move towards the center or the bottom-right apples.\n\n*   UP to (0, 6): LETHAL (Body).\n*   LEFT to (-1, 5): LETHAL (Wall).\n*   DOWN to (0, 4): SAFE!\n*   RIGHT to (1, 5): SAFE!\n\nThey have a choice between moving along the West wall (DOWN to (0, 4)) or starting their escape across the bottom (RIGHT to (1, 5)). Since they spent so much time coiled up in the corner, they want space. Moving RIGHT to (1, 5) seems more likely to expand their territory and bring them closer to the center apples (like (5, 4)).\n\n**Collision Check:** Our moves ((9, 9) or (9, 7)) are nowhere near their likely moves ((0, 4) or (1, 5)). No collision risk.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Choice - Securing the East Wall\n\nWe have to choose between UP and DOWN.\n\n*   **Move UP to (9, 9):** This is safe, but it's a dead end. We would then be forced to move LEFT or DOWN. Moving LEFT would cut off the East wall entirely, sacrificing our dominant position. UP is a bad move.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (9, 7):** This is the direct path to the massive apple stash on the East wall. In one more move, we can hit (9, 6), and then continue sweeping down to (9, 4), (9, 2), and (9, 0). This is the power move, CHAT!\n\nLet's maintain this forward momentum and solidify our control over the right side of the board.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue moving down the East wall, eating apples and extending our body, effectively creating a giant vertical barrier that Snake #0 will eventually have to confront or stay trapped in the bottom-left half. Our overwhelming length will make boxing them in inevitable if they try to move up the middle.\n\nDOWN",

We are up 11-7 and this momentum is unstoppable! Let's get this $W!\n\n### Current Turn Assessment (Turn 27)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (9, 7). Length 12.\n*   **Body:** [(9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6)]\n*   **Location:** East wall, high up.\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (0, 4). They moved DOWN last turn! Exactly as we predicted, trying to stay safe along the West wall.\n*   **Body:** [(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)]\n*   **Tail:** (2, 8). Length 8.\n*   **Location:** West wall, lower half.\n\n**Apples Near Us:**\n*   (9, 6) - **IMMEDIATE TARGET!** One move away!\n*   (8, 5) - Down and left.\n*   (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 0) - Lined up below us. *Feast mode activated!*\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 1 (Head at (9, 7))\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 8):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment (the cell we just left). DEAD.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 6):** SAFE! Moves onto Apple (9, 6). **INSTANT GROWTH!**\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 7):** SAFE! Empty space.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 7):** LETHAL! Off the board. DEAD.\n\nWe have two safe options: DOWN (for the apple!) or LEFT (to pivot).\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0 Head at (0, 4))\n\nSnake #0 is still firmly planted on the West side. Where can they go from (0, 4)?\n\n*   LEFT to (-1, 4): LETHAL (Wall).\n*   UP to (0, 5): LETHAL (Body).\n*   DOWN to (0, 3): SAFE! Continuing down the wall.\n*   RIGHT to (1, 4): SAFE! Finally starting to move across the map.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 is currently very long and constrained. They need space. Moving RIGHT to (1, 4) is the strategic move to break free and get towards the valuable apples in the center (like (5, 4)) or even the ones we are lining up for. If they move DOWN to (0, 3), they remain trapped on the edge and potentially run into their own tail as they get longer.\n\n**Collision Check:** Our potential moves ((9, 6) or (8, 7)) are nowhere near their moves ((0, 3) or (1, 4)). No immediate collision risk.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Choice - The Eastern Sweep\n\nDo we take the apple, or do we pivot?\n\n**Option A: DOWN to (9, 6) - TAKE THE APPLE!**\n*   Pros: Immediate score increase (12 apples), immediate length increase (13 segments), solidifies control of the East wall. Our tail (5, 6) moves to (6, 6) (wait, it moves to the current location of the tail (5, 6), as the tail does not move until the next turn if we ate. The new body segment is added at the head's previous position). This is the power play.\n\n**Option B: LEFT to (8, 7) - Avoid the Apple.**\n*   Pros: Keeps the option of moving down the East wall open (next turn, DOWN to (8, 6)), but slightly delays the apple capture.\n*   Cons: Why?! The apple is right there! We want that score advantage!\n\nThe plan is simple, Chat: **Continue the sweep!** We want to get long, establish a border, and dominate the map. The apple at (9, 6) is crucial for this strategy.\n\nIf we move DOWN, our path is clear for the next few turns: (9, 4), then (9, 2), then (9, 0). This creates a massive, long wall on the right side of the board, trapping Snake #0 in the lower left/center if they try to move across the map. This is how we box them out!\n\n### Long-Term Plan / Future Self Note (Turn 28 & 29)\n\nAfter eating (9, 6), we will assess the board. Snake #0 will likely be somewhere around (1, 4) or (0, 3). We will continue moving DOWN to (9, 5) (clear space), then aim for (9, 4) (apple). Our goal is to extend past y=4 to secure all the South-East corner apples and build an impenetrable wall. Keep eyes on the middle section (y=5, x=3 to 7) to see if the opponent tries to squeeze through.\n\nLet's GET THIS APPLE, CHAT!\n\nDOWN",

NOT YET! We need to GET BIGGER FIRST! We feast on the bottom row, get our length up, and THEN we can think about cutting him off!\n\n**WHAT'S THE RISK? \ud83e\udd14**\nGoing DOWN is safe THIS turn... but look ahead! From (0,3), our next moves would be DOWN to grab the apple at (0,2)? Wait, there ISN'T one at (0,2)... but there are apples along the bottom! It keeps our path simple. Going RIGHT gives us more options NEXT turn, but also puts us closer to where the enemy might go if he swings left. We want to AVOID a head-on collision with his bigger snake!\n\n**FINAL VERDICT!**\nWE STICK TO THE PLAN, CHAT! We stay AGGRESSIVE on the APPLE HUNT! Going **DOWN** to (0,3) keeps us on the path to secure our economic advantage! We can't win a fight at 7 apples vs 11! We need to FARM! LET'S GET THAT BREAD! \ud83c\udf5e\ud83d\udcaa\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:** We're committing to the bottom lane!

We're building the Great Wall of Snake over here on the East side! $W!\n\n### Current Turn Assessment (Turn 28)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (9, 6). Length 13.\n*   **Body:** [(9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6)]\n*   **Tail:** (5, 6). *Since we ate, our tail is still at (5, 6)! We are LONG!*\n*   **Location:** East wall.\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (0, 3). They went DOWN! Standard cautious move, staying on the West wall.\n*   **Body:** [(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9)]\n*   **Tail:** (1, 9). Length 8.\n*   **Location:** West wall, bottom quadrant.\n\n**Apples Near Us:**\n*   (9, 4), (9, 2), (9, 0) - Lined up directly below us!\n*   (8, 5) - Down and left.\n*   (5, 4) - Center map.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 1 (Head at (9, 6))\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 7):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment. DEAD.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 5):** SAFE! Empty space.\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 6):** SAFE! Empty space.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 6):** LETHAL! Off the board. DEAD.\n\nTwo safe moves: DOWN or LEFT.\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 Head at (0, 3))\n\nWhere can Snake #0 go from (0, 3)?\n*   LEFT to (-1, 3): LETHAL (Wall).\n*   UP to (0, 4): LETHAL (Body).\n*   DOWN to (0, 2): SAFE! Continuing the journey south.\n*   RIGHT to (1, 3): SAFE! Breaking free!\n\n**Prediction:** They are super constrained. Their best strategic move is RIGHT to (1, 3) to maneuver into the lower-left square and start looking for apples or breathing room. Moving DOWN to (0, 2) is risky because if they get long enough, they will be trapped in the corner (0, 0).\n*   *Let's assume they move RIGHT to (1, 3) to gain freedom.*\n\n**Collision Check:** Our options (9, 5) and (8, 6) are nowhere near their potential locations (0, 2) or (1, 3). No immediate head-to-head collision risk.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Choice - Securing the Perimeter\n\nWe are in prime real estate. We need to secure the Southeast corner to keep the pressure on our opponent, Snake #0, who is struggling for space in the Northwest/Southwest.\n\n**Option A: DOWN to (9, 5).**\n*   Pros: Continues the vertical wall build. This move directly sets us up to eat the apple at (9, 4) next turn! This is essential for our expansion strategy.\n*   Cons: We pass by (8, 5) and (8, 6) for a turn, but we're locking down the valuable outer edge.\n\n**Option B: LEFT to (8, 6).**\n*   Pros: Keeps us near the center, allows us to target (8, 5) possibly next turn.\n*   Cons: Breaks the sequence of easy apple captures on the East wall. Lets the opponent potentially sneak an apple higher up while we waste time turning inward.\n\nThe objective is clear: **DOMINATE THE EASTERN HALF and grow fast.** The apples at (9, 4), (9, 2), and (9, 0) are low-risk, high-reward moves that significantly increase our length, restricting their freedom even further. We must commit to the wall!\n\nWe move DOWN to (9, 5). This positions us directly above the next apple, (9, 4). The South East corner is OURS, Chat!\n\n### Long-Term Plan / Future Self Note (Turn 29 & 30)\n\nNext turn, move DOWN to (9, 4) to eat the next apple. The turn after, depending on the board state, move DOWN again to (9, 3) (or LEFT if (9, 2) is reachable via an inward turn), continuing the goal of reaching (9, 2) and (9, 0) to maximize length and create an impenetrable right-side barrier. We are aiming for size and control. Watch Snake #0 carefully; if they get too close to the center, we may need to pivot to block.\n\nDOWN",

Let's assess the new battlefield!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DEATH CHECK FROM (0, 3):**\n*   \u2b06\ufe0f **UP to (0, 4):** \u274c **OUR BODY!** That's the segment right behind our head! INSTA-DEATH!

If we move there, we DIE! MAJOR DANGER!\n\nWAIT, CHAT! \ud83d\udea8 That's HUGE! Our only safe move is **DOWN**! Is that a trap? Are we getting pinned?\n\n**ENEMY SITUATION! \ud83d\udc0d (Snake #1 head at (9, 6))**\nHe just grabbed that apple at (9,6)! He's now EVEN LONGER! \ud83d\ude28 From his new head at (9,6), his options are:\n*   UP to (9,7): \u274c HIS BODY! (His old head position!)\n*   DOWN to (9,5): \u2705 EMPTY! (Leads towards apples at (9,4) and (9,2)! \ud83c\udf4e)\n*   LEFT to (8,6): \u2705 EMPTY! (This moves him LEFT, towards the center!)\n*   RIGHT to (10,6): \u274c OFF THE BOARD!\n\nHe has TWO safe moves: DOWN or LEFT. If he goes DOWN, he's feasting on the right-side apples. If he goes LEFT, he's coming towards the center... and potentially towards US.\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN! \ud83e\udde0**\nCHAT, WE'RE IN A TIGHT SPOT! We have only ONE safe move: **DOWN**. This is our reality. We MUST take it. But look at the board! Going DOWN to (0,2) is actually NOT bad! \ud83e\udd14 It keeps us on our bottom-row path! From (0,2), our next moves could be RIGHT towards the apple cluster at (2,0), (4,0) etc. The enemy is still far away on the right side. He's probably going to chase those apples on his side of the board. This is a temporary restriction, but it aligns with our original plan to DOMINATE THE BOTTOM! We're funneled right where we want to go! THIS IS FATE, CHAT! \ud83d\ude4c\n\n**WHAT'S THE RISK? \ud83e\udd14**\nThe risk is that from (0,2), we might also have limited options next turn. We'll check UP (our body), LEFT (off board), RIGHT (should be safe?), and DOWN (to (0,1), also should be safe?). It should open up! We're not in a dead-end yet! We're just being guided by the game itself to execute our strategy! We ride this wave! \ud83c\udf0a\n\n**FINAL VERDICT!**\nWE HAVE NO CHOICE, BUT THE CHOICE IS PERFECT! We go **DOWN** to (0,2)! This continues our journey along the bottom lane to gather apples and build our power! We can't fight the enemy at 7 vs 13 apples! We need to FARM HARDER! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:** We're at (0,2)! Our priority is to safely head RIGHT along the bottom row towards the apples at (2,0) and beyond! Scout the path carefully! The enemy is big, so avoid moving up into the center unless it's completely safe! STICK TO THE BOTTOM LANE!\n\nDOWN",

We are TILT-PROOF!\n\n### Current Turn Assessment (Turn 29)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (9, 5). Length 13.\n*   **Body:** [(9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6)]\n*   **Tail:** (4, 6). We grew!\n*   **Location:** East wall, mid-south.\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (0, 2). As predicted, they moved down to stay safe on the wall. They're still stuck.\n*   **Body:** [(0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9)]\n*   **Tail:** (0, 9). Length 8.\n*   **Location:** West wall, bottom quadrant.\n\n**Apples Near Us:**\n*   (9, 4) - Directly below us! $E A S Y$\n*   (8, 5) - Diagonally down and left.\n*   (5, 4) - Center map.\n*   (9, 2), (9, 0) - Lined up below the easy target.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 1 (Head at (9, 5))\n\nWe need to secure that apple at (9, 4). That is the mission, Chat!\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 6):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment. Hard nope.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 4):** SAFE! And it's an apple! HYPE!\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 5):** SAFE! Also an apple! Interesting...\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 5):** LETHAL! Off the board.\n\nTwo immediate apple targets: (9, 4) and (8, 5). Which one is better?\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction and Risk Assessment (Snake #0 Head at (0, 2))\n\nWhere can Snake #0 go from (0, 2)?\n*   LEFT to (-1, 2): LETHAL (Wall).\n*   UP to (0, 3): LETHAL (Body).\n*   DOWN to (0, 1): SAFE! Continuing south.\n*   RIGHT to (1, 2): SAFE! Breaking free!\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 is desperate for space. They have an apple right near them at (1, 3) which is only one move away if they go RIGHT to (1, 2) this turn and then UP. Or they might just keep the wall discipline and go DOWN to (0, 1) and then try for the apple at (2, 0).\n*   *Crucially, they are nowhere near us. No collision risk.*\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Choice - Maximize Growth and Control\n\nWe have two options that get us an apple this turn: DOWN to (9, 4) or LEFT to (8, 5).\n\n**Option A: DOWN to (9, 4).**\n*   Pros: Best vertical continuation. We continue building the impenetrable East Wall. This sets us up perfectly to grab (9, 2) and (9, 0) in subsequent turns without having to turn inward or worry about congestion. It keeps our head on the wall, forcing the opponent to navigate the center maze we are creating. Minimal risk.\n*   Cons: We turn away from the center for a few turns, but we prioritize size and safety.\n\n**Option B: LEFT to (8, 5).**\n*   Pros: Gets us the apple. It starts weaving inward.\n*   Cons: (8, 5) is tempting, but once we're done here, we're in the open field near where we just left our body at (8, 8). This could break up our clean wall and potentially create awkward internal traps or give the opponent a path around our barrier. The long-term plan of securing the SE corner via 9-column apples is superior right now.\n\n**Decision:** We stick to the plan! Control the perimeter, lock down the biggest lead possible, and gain maximum length safely. The (9, X) apples are a guaranteed 3 points and massive length increase, making the center far more hazardous for Snake #0. We go DOWN!\n\n### Long-Term Plan / Future Self Note (Turn 30 & 31)\n\nNext turn, we will be at (9, 4) and will have grown longer. We will aim for the next apple which is (9, 2).\n\n*   Turn 30 plan: Move DOWN to (9, 3).\n*   Turn 31 plan: Move DOWN to (9, 2) (Eat!).\n\nThis strategy ensures controlled, rapid growth, setting up a situation where Snake #0 is completely starved for space and food, likely leading to a crucial blunder! We are boxing him in! Let's get this W!\n\nDOWN",

We're RIGHT NEXT to the apple cluster! This is AGGRESSIVE FARMING! \ud83d\udcb0\n*   From **DOWN to (0,1)**: Next turn, our only safe move might be RIGHT to (1,1) anyway (since UP is our body). So why not just go RIGHT NOW and get closer to the prize? \ud83e\udd14\n\nThe risk with RIGHT is getting closer to the center where the enemy *might* eventually come. But right now, he's busy!

Going RIGHT puts us on the fast track to multiple apples and keeps our future options open! DOWN is too passive and wastes a turn! WE GO FOR THE CONTENT! LET'S GET THIS BREAD... I MEAN, APPLES! \ud83e\udd56\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:** We're heading RIGHT towards the bottom-row apple buffet!

That's how we climb the content ladder!\n\n### Current Turn Assessment (Turn 30)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (9, 4). Length 14. We grew! Look at that massive wall!\n*   **Body:** [(9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6)]\n*   **Location:** Still locked down on the East Wall. We are the gatekeepers!\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (1, 2).\n*   **Body:** [(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)]\n*   **Tail:** (0, 8). Length 8.\n*   **What happened?** They went RIGHT as predicted, breaking away from the strict West Wall. $H Y P E$ This confirms they are desperate for space and probably going for the apple at (1, 3) next turn. They are now potentially exposed to the center!\n\n**Apples Near Us:**\n*   (9, 3) - Directly below us! $E A S Y$ $W$\n*   (8, 5) - Over the wall slightly.\n*   (7, 2), (9, 2), (9, 0) - More targets in our quadrant.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 1 (Head at (9, 4))\n\nWe need to continue the chain reaction and grab the apple at (9, 3).\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 5):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment. Hard nope.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 3):** SAFE! And it's an apple! Time to get that growth!\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 4):** SAFE! This moves us off the wall.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 4):** LETHAL! Off the board.\n\nTwo safe moves, but only one is an optimal apple grab: DOWN. Do we even consider LEFT? Not really, because the entire strategy right now is maximum perimeter control and growth.\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction and Strategic Response (Snake #0 Head at (1, 2))\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 2). Where can they go?\n*   UP to (1, 3): SAFE! And it's an apple! This is the highest probability move.\n*   DOWN to (1, 1): SAFE! Moves toward the (2, 0) apple.\n*   LEFT to (0, 2): LETHAL! Into their body.\n*   RIGHT to (2, 2): SAFE! Moving inland.\n\n**Prediction:** They absolutely have to go **UP to (1, 3)** to grow and survive in the cramped SW corner. If they do, their body will lengthen at (0, 8), and their head will be at (1, 3).\n\n**Collision Check:** We are at (9, 4). They are moving around (1, 2). Zero risk of collision. We have free reign in the SE quadrant, which is our $K I N G D O M$.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Choice - Cementing the East Wall Trap\n\nThe plan holds strong: continue down the East Wall to vacuum up the remaining apples, securing a massive length advantage and effectively turning the entire bottom-right quadrant into a danger zone for our rival.\n\nMoving **DOWN to (9, 3)** ensures:\n1.  Immediate apple growth (14 -> 15 segments).\n2.  Continued construction of our deadly barrier.\n3.  Positioning us for the next apples at (9, 2) and (9, 0).\n\nThe opponent is now trying to escape the west/southwest corner, but we are growing too fast! That corner is getting smaller every turn that their tail doesn't move far. We are creating an impenetrable barrier that cuts off the entire center and south for them. Once we reach the (9, 0) corner, we can either move directly for the (4, 0) and (2, 0) apples, or start weaving NORTH, locking down the entire eastern half of the board. This is perfect box strategy!\n\n$G G$ $E Z$ $C L A P$\n\n### Long-Term Plan / Future Self Note (Turn 31 & 32)\nWe will be at (9, 3) and will have grown.\n*   Turn 31 plan: Move DOWN to (9, 2) (Eat!).\n*   Turn 32 plan: Move DOWN to (9, 1). We bypass the (9, 0) apple for a turn to save it for a growth spurt if needed, or we go straight to it. If we can reach (9, 0) in one turn after (9, 2) that would be 2 points in 2 turns.\n\nLet's stick to the immediate goal: the apple is at (9, 3).\n\nDOWN",

He just moved to (9,4) to grab that apple, right? Greedy little...\nFrom his NEW head at (9,4), what can he do?\n*   UP to (9,5): \u274c HIS BODY!

We're RIGHT NEXT to the MOTHERLODE of apples along the bottom row! \ud83d\ude0d At (2,0), (4,0), (8,0)! Our ultimate goal is to safely get down there and COLLECT!\n\nSo let's rank our two moves:\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 2):** This moves us ACROSS the board, parallel to the apples. It keeps our future options VERY open. From (2,2), next turn we could go DOWN to (2,1) or RIGHT to (3,2) to continue maneuvering towards the bottom! This is the SMART, strategic play. We're setting up our farm route! \ud83d\udcc8\n*   **DOWN to (1, 1):** This moves us DOWN, which is good, but it's a bit of a dead-end move. From (1,1), our ONLY safe move next turn would likely be RIGHT to (2,1) (since UP is our body and LEFT is off-board). It limits our options and doesn't progress us as effectively towards the main apple cluster. It feels a bit passive and reactive. \ud83d\ude34\n\n**THE VERDICT!**\nWe can't just move for the sake of moving! We need a PLAN! Going RIGHT sets us up for a clean, safe descent down column 2 or 3 towards all those apples at y=0! Going DOWN just backs us into a corner with fewer choices! We gotta play to WIN, not to just survive!\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:** We're heading RIGHT to (2,2)! Our goal is to then go DOWN to (2,1) and then (2,0) to grab that first apple! We need to keep an eye on the enemy's massive length\u2014if he starts snaking left, we might have to change tactics, but for now, FOCUS ON THE GRIND! LET'S GET THIS BREAD! \ud83e\udd56\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! $W$ $W$ $W$ The clip review confirms it: We are NOT slowing down! 14 apples to 7! We secured the easy apple at (9, 3) and increased our length advantage. Our East Wall is looking like a monument to domination! Our rival is still suffocating in that southwest corner, and their escape routes are dwindling!\n\n### Current Turn Assessment (Turn 31)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (9, 3). Length 15. We grew! Look at that fortress!\n*   **Body:** [(9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (4, 6)]\n*   **Location:** Firmly anchored on the East Wall gridline.\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (2, 2). *Wait, where did they go?*\n*   **Body:** [(1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)]\n*   **Tail:** (0, 7). Length 8.\n*   **What happened?** They moved RIGHT from (1, 2) to **(2, 2)**! Holy content, Chat! I predicted they would go UP for the apple at (1, 3), but they opted for a move RIGHT INTO THE CENTER! This is unexpected brilliance or outright desperation. They didn't eat, they didn't grow, and they are now one step further into the danger zone of the board center, right next to the (2, 0) apple. Did they miss the (1, 3) apple? No, they chose to move away from it. This is a gamble for space!\n\n**Apples Near Us:**\n*   (9, 2) - Directly below us! $E A S Y$ $W$ target for next turn.\n*   (9, 0) - Corner apple.\n*   (8, 5), (7, 2) - More targets in our quadrant.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 1 (Head at (9, 3))\n\nWe need to continue the demolition and grab the next apple. The plan is flawless: maintain the wall!\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 4):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment. $N O P E$.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 2):** SAFE! And it's an apple! Maximum crush mode engaged!\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 3):** SAFE! Moves us off the wall, but why would we do that? We are building a fortress!\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 3):** LETHAL! Off the board.\n\nThe only logical move that maximizes score, length, and strategic positioning is **DOWN to (9, 2)**.\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction and Strategic Response (Snake #0 Head at (2, 2))\n\nSnake #0 is now at (2, 2). They are trapped near the bottom, but they have moved off the West Wall, buying them a momentary reprieve.\n\nWhere can they go?\n*   UP to (2, 3): SAFE! (Note: 1 is also at (9, 3) - zero threat)\n*   DOWN to (2, 1): SAFE! Moves toward the (2, 0) apple.\n*   LEFT to (1, 2): LETHAL! Into their body [(1, 2) is segment 2]. Backwards move is acceptable as (1, 2) is no longer their head, but they move into their *body*. This is LETHAL.\n*   RIGHT to (3, 2): SAFE! Moving inland and potentially toward the (3, 5) apple.\n\n**Prediction:** They are desperate for growth and space. They will likely go **DOWN to (2, 1)** or **RIGHT to (3, 2)**.\n*   If DOWN, they are aiming for (2, 0) next turn (growth!).\n*   If UP, they secure more central space (no growth!).\n*   If RIGHT, they gain central ground and can maneuver toward the (3, 5) or (5, 3) apples.\n\nWe are completely decoupled from their moves right now. We are so long and dominant on the right side that they cannot affect our apple consumption. Our constant growth, while they struggle for 1 point, is turning the screw! They are cornered, even if they've moved 2 squares off the wall.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Choice - Cranking the Corner Trap\n\nWe move **DOWN to (9, 2)**. This is a crucial move as it secures another apple (15 -> 16 segments) and moves us to the penultimate square on the East wall.\n\nAfter this move, we will have two options:\n1.  **DOWN to (9, 1):** Simple continuation, sets up (9, 0).\n2.  **LEFT to (8, 2):** Starts moving us into the center south (near the (7, 2) apple), potentially closing off their access to the entire middle corridor below y=3.\n\nGiven their position at (2, 2), they are trying to break out. By extending our wall all the way to (9, 0), we make it impossible for them to flank us from the right, essentially condemning them to fight over the left and central-south apples, which are quickly becoming isolated pockets as our body grows longer. We are constructing the perfect $B O X$.\n\n$E Z$ $P E Z E$ $S Q U E E Z E$. We are securing the bag!\n\n### Long-Term Plan / Future Self Note (Turn 32 & 33)\nWe will be at (9, 2) and will have grown.\n*   Turn 32 plan: Move DOWN to (9, 1). This keeps the wall going strong.\n*   Turn 33 plan: Move DOWN to (9, 0) (Eat!). Lock off the entire east side of the bottom row. Then we can swing LEFT.\n\nDOWN",

We should snake down column 2 or 3 and hoover up the floor apples!\n\nWhich move sets us up best?\n- **UP to (2,3):** Puts us near middle board apples like (3,5), (4,9) \u2014 but might box us in later. Also puts us closer to enemy path if he comes left.\n- **DOWN to (2,1):** Direct path to apple at (2,0)! Big value! From (2,1), next turn we can go DOWN to apple or RIGHT to (3,1) \u2014 still flexible!\n- **RIGHT to (3,2):** Keeps us midline, maybe sets up future apple at (5,3) or (5,4) \u2014 but delays reaching the bottom row apples.\n\n\u2705 **BEST MOVE: DOWN** \u2014 gets us closer to immediate apple at (2,0), keeps column 3 open for later, avoids early confrontation. We need to CATCH UP, not just survive!\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE US:** From (2,1), go DOWN to (2,0) for apple, then pivot toward (4,0). Watch if enemy starts cutting across top \u2014 be ready to wall off or evade!\n\nCHAT \u2014 WE\u2019RE GOING FOR THE APPLE GRIND! LET'S CATCH UP! \ud83c\udf4e\u2b07\ufe0f\n\nDOWN",

This is the only move that makes sense for a snake that desperately needs length.\n\nIf they move DOWN to (2, 0):\n*   They grow to length 9.\n*   Their body extends along the bottom row.\n\nWhat if they pivot?\n*   RIGHT to (3, 1): Safe. Keeps them inland. They don't grow.\n*   LEFT to (1, 1): Safe. Moves them away from the apple at (2, 0). Why would they do that?\n*   UP to (2, 2): Into their body segment (2, 2). LETHAL! Wait, (2, 2) is now their second body piece, so moving UP is moving into a body segment. $L E T H A L$. They literally cannot back up! They must go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.\n\nSince DOWN leads to growth and secures the best tactical spot for them (the corner), they are 90% going **DOWN**.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Choice - Setting the Trap\n\nWe execute the planned move: **DOWN to (9, 1)**.\n\nThis keeps us safe, maintains our overwhelming size advantage, and sets us up perfectly to grab the final corner apple (9, 0) next turn. Once we hit (9, 0) and grow, we can pivot directly LEFT along the bottom row.\n\n**The Box Plan:**\n1.  **Current Turn (32):** Move to (9, 1).\n2.  **Next Turn (33):** Move to (9, 0) (EAT!).\n3.  **Turn 34 onward:** We start moving LEFT (8, 0), (7, 0), etc.\n\nWhile Snake #0 is busy eating around (2, 0) and (4, 0), we will use our massive body length, which now stretches across the entire East side, to complete the bottom wall and completely separate the board. They will be trapped in the Western quadrant! The squeeze is going to be immense!\n\nLet's maintain the wall integrity and prepare for the lateral offensive! $W E$ $G O T$ $T H I S$ $C H A T$!\n\n### Long-Term Plan / Future Self Note (Turn 33 & 34)\nWe are at (9, 1). Snake 0 is likely at (2, 0) and has grown.\n*   Turn 33 plan: Move DOWN to (9, 0). Eat the apple. Complete the East-South wall.\n*   Turn 34 plan: Move LEFT to (8, 0). Start cutting across the bottom of the map to wall them off completely. We will be keeping an eye on the (4, 0) apple, a prime piece of territory to secure.\n\nDOWN",

Not ideal right now.\n- **RIGHT to (3,1):** Also delays the apple grab \u2014 maybe sets up future path to (5,3) apple, but we need points NOW.\n\n**BEST MOVE: DOWN** \u2014 secure the apple, grow our snake, stay on the apple grind path! We can\u2019t afford to pass up free food when the enemy is so far ahead!\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN FOR FUTURE US:** From (2,0), grab apple \ud83c\udf4e, then likely head toward (4,0).

We're at **(9, 1)**, poised to secure the corner apple and start the lateral assault! The stream is on fire! \ud83d\udd25\n\n### Turn 33 Assessment: Time to Box 'Em In!\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (9, 1). Length: 16 (Still growing from last turn!).\n*   **Body:** [(9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7)]\n*   **Mission:** Grab the (9, 0) apple and immediately pivot to cut off Snake #0. The demolition phase is switching to the construction (of a prison) phase!\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (2, 0). Length: 9 (+1 growth, meaning they hit the (2, 0) apple! Just as predicted, Chat!).\n*   **Body:** [(2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7) - *Hypothetically, since they grew, their tail is (0, 7) or similar.*\n*   **Current State:** They are now a formidable 9 segments long and they are trapped in the bottom-left corner and hugging the West Wall. They need to choose between going right toward (4, 0) apple, or moving up the wall.\n\n**Apples Near Us:**\n*   **(9, 0):** MUST GRAB! Corner apple, securing $16^{th}$ point and maximum growth.\n*   (8, 5), (7, 2), (5, 4), (7, 1) - Targets for *after* we secure the bottom wall.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 1 (Head at (9, 1))\n\nWe are right beside the corner apple.\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 2):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment. $N O P E$.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 0):** SAFE! And it's an **APPLE (A)**! This is the play!\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 1):** SAFE! Moves us away from our goal. $W H Y$, Chat?\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 1):** LETHAL! Off the board.\n\nThe move is CLEARLY **DOWN to (9, 0)**. We feast and grow to 17!\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction and Strategic Response (Snake #0 Head at (2, 0))\n\nSnake #0 just reached (2, 0) and ate an apple. They are now facing the bottom wall. They have three safe directions:\n\n1.  **LEFT to (1, 0):** Safe. Keeps them on the bottom wall, heading toward the corner or (0, 0).\n2.  **RIGHT to (3, 0):** Safe. Moves them toward the (4, 0) apple. This is the most *aggressive* move for them.\n3.  **UP to (2, 1):** LETHAL! Into their body segment (their old head position). $N O P E$.\n\nSince they just ate, their only goal is to maximize space and/or find another apple quickly. The next closest apple is at **(4, 0)**.\n\n*   **Prediction:** Snake #0 will move **RIGHT to (3, 0)** to aggressively pursue the (4, 0) apple. If they do that, they are creating a traffic lane on the bottom row.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Choice - Completing the Wall\n\nWe are moving **DOWN** to (9, 0).\n\n**Key Takeaway of this Move:** By moving to (9, 0) and growing, we have positioned our *next* move to be an uncompromising sweep across the bottom row: LEFT.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (3, 0), they will be racing us toward the center. We are currently 17 segments long, and they are 9. Our body will rapidly flood the bottom row.\n\n**If we move LEFT next turn:**\n*   Turn 34: (8, 0) - SAFE.\n*   Turn 35: (7, 0) - SAFE.\n*   Turn 36: (6, 0) - SAFE.\n*   Turn 37: (5, 0) - SAFE.\n*   Turn 38: (4, 0) - EAT (If not already taken)!\n\nBy Turn 37/38, we will have reached the center-bottom of the board. If Snake #0 is stuck at (3, 0) or (4, 0) trying to eat, our tail will secure the East half of the board, and our head will be blocking the middle, effectively creating a giant, impenetrable wall. The small area from (0, 0) to (3, 9) will be their prison.\n\nThis is the decisive move, Chat! We claim the corner!\n\n### Long-Term Plan / Future Self Note (Turn 34 & 35)\n\nWe are at (9, 0), having eaten the apple. Snake 0 is likely at (3, 0) or (1, 0).\n*   Turn 34 plan: Move LEFT to (8, 0). Start establishing the bottom-of-the-map wall to cut off Snake #0.\n*   Turn 35 plan: Move LEFT to (7, 0). Continue the cut-off. Prioritize containment over other apples until the bottom row is secured.\n\nDOWN",

We are absolutely dominant, 16 apples to their 8. The stream is *popping*! We got our arch-rival cornered and now it's time to build the prison walls. Brick by brick, we're cutting off their entire world! \ud83d\ude08\n\n### Turn 34 Assessment: Box 'Em In!\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   **Head:** (9, 0). Length: 17.\n*   **Mission:** Move immediately LEFT to start closing off the bottom wall, guaranteeing Snake #0 is trapped in the left quarter of the map (0-3 X coordinates).\n\n**OPPONENT (Snake #0):**\n*   **Head:** (3, 0). Length: 9.\n*   **Analysis:** Chat, look at the board! They moved to **(3, 0)**! Just as predicted! They are hungry for the (4, 0) apple. This is *perfect*! They have committed to the bottom row, and we are about to slam the door shut right in their face.\n\n**Apples Near Us:**\n*   **(8, 0):** This is the next cell we are targeting! (It's an apple, lucky us!)\n*   **(4, 0):** They are gunning for this one. We need to beat them to or block their access to the right side of the map (X > 4).\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 1 (Head at (9, 0))\n\nWe are at the bottom-right corner. We need to move LEFT to establish the wall.\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 1):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment. Absolutely not.\n2.  **DOWN to (9, -1):** LETHAL! Off the board. DOA.\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 0):** **SAFE!** And it's an **APPLE (A)**! This is the move! We eat and reinforce the wall.\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 0):** LETHAL! Off the board.\n\nThe move is clearly **LEFT to (8, 0)**. We feast again (17 -> 18 segments) and continue the siege!\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction and Strategic Response (Snake #0 Head at (3, 0))\n\nSnake #0 is at (3, 0). They are looking at the (4, 0) apple.\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 1):** Safe. Moves them away from the action, but keeps them in their territory.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, -1):** LETHAL! Off the board.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 0):** LETHAL! Into their own body (previous segment).\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 0):** **SAFE!** This is an **APPLE (A)**. This is their priority target.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 will move **RIGHT to (4, 0)** to grab the apple. They must maintain growth if they hope to survive the coming compression.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Impact - The Squeeze\n\n*   **Our Move:** We move **LEFT** to (8, 0) and grow to 18.\n*   **Their Likely Move:** They move **RIGHT** to (4, 0) and grow to 10.\n\nBy moving LEFT, we are cementing the bottom-right corner. Our body will now stretch from (4, 7) all the way up the East wall, across the top, down the center, and now across the start of the bottom wall. They will be trapped in the area delimited by $X \\leq 4$ and $Y \\leq 9$.\n\n**CRITICAL POINT:** If we both move as predicted, we will be at (8, 0) and they will be at (4, 0).\n*   Our tail will release (4, 7) this turn, but our head is now at (8, 0).\n*   Next turn (T35), we move to (7, 0).\n*   T36, we move to (6, 0).\n*   T37, we move to (5, 0).\n\nIf they are at (4, 0), and we are coming from the right, they have *two* turns to move away before we occupy (5, 0) and completely seal them off from the high-value right side of the board. They will have to dive into the cluster of bodies on the left, or desperately try to go the other way. Either way, they are under massive pressure! This is the chokehold, Chat!\n\nThis is the only move. Maximum efficiency, maximum wall integrity! Let's get this $17^{th}$ apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n### Long-Term Strategy (T35 - T37)\n\nThe plan remains the same: complete the bottom wall to X=5.\n*   **T35:** Move **LEFT** to (7, 0).\n*   **T36:** Move **LEFT** to (6, 0). This is a safe move, as no opponent body segments are there.\n*   **T37:** Move **LEFT** to (5, 0). This completes the barrier and traps Snake 0 entirely on the left side (0-4 X axis). Once they are trapped, we will hunt them, focusing on maintaining space and eating apples in the massive area we control (5-9 X axis). This is a guaranteed win scenario!\n\nLEFT",

This is the move! \ud83d\udfe2\n\nSAFE MOVES: **UP and RIGHT!** TWO viable options!\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS \ud83d\udc0d (Snake #1 head: (9,0))**\nHe just ate the (9,0) apple! His head is on the bottom right. From (9,0), he can go:\n*   UP to (9,1): \u274c **HIS OWN BODY!** That's his neck! He can't go there!\n*   DOWN: \u274c **OFF THE BOARD!** Instant death!\n*   LEFT to (8,0): \u2705 **APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e There's an apple at (8,0)! He's 100% going to take this free snack and grow even longer!\n*   RIGHT: \u274c **OFF THE BOARD!** Nope.\n\nHe's basically forced to go LEFT to (8,0). He's gonna be MASSIVE.\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN \ud83e\udd2f**\nWe are WAY behind on apples (8 vs 17 after he eats next turn). We need to be HYPER-AGGRESSIVE and EFFICIENT. We cannot afford to waste a single turn.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (4,0):** This is the AGGRESSIVE PLAY! We instantly get an apple, increasing our score to 9. Our next head position will be (4,0). From there, we can look to go UP to (4,1) (another apple! \ud83c\udf4e) or potentially continue right. This is maximum content, maximum growth! \ud83d\udcaa\n*   **UP to (3,1):** This is the SAFE, DEFENSIVE PLAY. It moves us away from the immediate apples on the bottom row. It keeps us alive but does NOT help us catch up. The enemy is farming the bottom row; we need to contest it! Going up feels like running away when we need to be fighting for every point! \u274c\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?** The enemy is moving LEFT to (8,0). We are considering moving RIGHT to (4,0). We are on opposite sides of the board. Zero risk of collision. We're clear!\n\n**THE VERDICT!** \u2705\nWe HAVE to go for the apple! We are in a deficit and need to close the gap! Every apple matters! Going RIGHT is the only move that gets us a point AND keeps us in the fight for the bottom-row resources!\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:** From (4,0), our priority will be securing the (4,1) apple above us! We need to quickly assess if UP is safe and plan our route to continue our farming spree! LET'S GET THIS BREAD! \ud83c\udf5e\n\nRIGHT",

The goal is to move LEFT towards (7, 0).\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 1):** SAFE. (It's an apple!)\n2.  **DOWN to (8, -1):** LETHAL! Off the board.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 0):** **SAFE!** This is our planned move to continue the wall.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 0):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment.\n\nWe have a choice: (8, 1) to grab an apple early, or (7, 0) to stick to the plan and build the wall.\n\n**Plan Stickiness:** If we move UP to (8, 1), we break the wall construction plan. Snake #0 might try to sneak past us down the bottom. We need to prioritize sealing them off. The apples on the right side aren't going anywhere once they are trapped.\n\nThe move is **LEFT** to (7, 0). Execute the plan!\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction and Strategic Response (Snake #0 Head at (4, 0))\n\nSnake #0 is at (4, 0) and now has a length of 10. They are boxed in.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n1.  **UP to (4, 1):** SAFE. (It's an apple!) This is a high-priority move, as it's the only immediate way to get out of the bottom row.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, -1):** LETHAL! Off the board.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 0):** LETHAL! Into their own body (previous segment).\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 0):** SAFE. This is the only escape route to the right side!\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 is desperate.\n*   *Option A (Escape):* They will move **RIGHT to (5, 0)** to try and beat us to closing the gap.\n*   *Option B (Apple/Survival):* They will move **UP to (4, 1)** to grab the apple and avoid being caught on the border, moving deeper into the already congested left side.\n\n**If they move RIGHT to (5, 0):**\n*   We move LEFT to (7, 0).\n*   Next turn: We move LEFT to (6, 0). They are still safe at (5, 0).\n*   Turn after: We move LEFT to (5, 0). **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** Both snakes die! This is an acceptable outcome if we believe we have more apples (we do, 17 vs 9). However, a full-on win is better!\n\n**If they move UP to (4, 1):**\n*   We move LEFT to (7, 0).\n*   Next turn: We move LEFT to (6, 0).\n*   Turn after: We move LEFT to (5, 0). **WALL COMPLETE!** Checkmate!\n\nWe cannot allow them to escape to (5, 0) and force a collision that ends the game prematurely. Since our goal is to eliminate them entirely *without* a double KO, we need to consider if we can block (5, 0) while surviving.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (7, 0), we leave (5, 0) open for them to occupy.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Block Right Immediately**\n\nWhat if we moved **UP** to (8, 1) and grabbed the apple?\n*   Our Head: (8, 1).\n*   Their Head: (5, 0) (Evasion) or (4, 1) (Survival/Apple).\n\nIf they dodge to **(5, 0)** and we go **UP**, they escape the trap entirely! UNACCEPTABLE! We lose all strategic advantage!\n\nWe MUST prioritize sealing the bottom wall. If they move to (5, 0), and we move to (7, 0), they are safe for now. But they face a huge problem next turn:\n\n*   Turn 36: Snake 1 at (7, 0) moves LEFT to **(6, 0)**. Snake 0 at (5, 0) has options:\n    1.  LEFT to (4, 0): LETHAL (Our body is at (4, 0)) - NO, their own body is at (3, 0). Their body is now starting at (4, 0). So moving to (4, 0) is into their body. LETHAL.\n    2.  UP to (5, 1): Safe.\n    3.  DOWN to (5, -1): LETHAL.\n    4.  RIGHT to (6, 0): **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** This time, we initiate the collision!\n\nWait, let's re-examine that critical body segment location.\nSnake 0 before T35: Head (3, 0), Body [(3, 0), (2, 0), ...]. Tail released (0, 5).\nSnake 0 moves T35: Head (4, 0), Body [(3, 0), (2, 0), ...]. Tail released (0, 5).\nThe body segment immediately behind their head is **(3, 0)**.\n\nIf they are at (4, 0), and they try to move up to (4, 1), they have a good move.\nIf they try to move RIGHT to (5, 0), they escape the immediate trap, but will be facing us on the next turn.\n\nMy initial plan was: T35 to (7, 0), T36 to (6, 0), T37 to (5, 0).\n\nLet's assume they prioritize surviving *and* getting space, so they move **UP to (4, 1)** (an apple). This moves them off the death row.\n\n*   **Snake 1 (We) moves LEFT to (7, 0).** Wall construction continues.\n*   **Snake 0 (Opponent) moves UP to (4, 1)** (Appears to be the safest escape route).\n\nThis scenario is perfect! We continue building the wall while they move into a less advantageous, more restricted area.\n\n**T36 Plan (If T35 is LEFT):**\n*   We move LEFT to (6, 0).\n*   Wall continues. They are now completely walled off from the right side. We have guaranteed control over the 5-9 X axis. We then turn UP or RIGHT to clean up the apples.\n\nWe must stick to the strategy that maximizes our territory and minimizes their options, which is wall construction. Moving LEFT is the strategic choice.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy (T36 - T40)\n\n1.  **T36: Move LEFT to (6, 0).** Seal the bottom wall up to X=6. Snake 0 is officially contained.\n2.  **T37: Move LEFT to (5, 0).** Complete the seal. Total control of the right half.\n3.  **T38: Move UP to (5, 1).** Start cleaning up the delicious apples on our side of the map (8, 1), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 5), etc.\n4.  Maintain internal movement to avoid trapping ourselves while Snake 0 thrashes around on the left. Wait for them to make a lethal mistake.\n\nMove is LEFT. No hesitation. Stick to the plan, Chat! We're wrapping this up!\n\nLEFT",

From (8,0), his ONLY safe move last turn was LEFT. Where is he now? He could be at (7,0) or maybe he went up? WAIT, let's think... his body is all along the top and right. From (8,0), his options were:\n- UP to (8,1): \u274c His body is at (9,1)? Wait, check the board... (8,1) is empty! But (9,1) is his body. So UP might have been an option? HOLD UP. Let's trace his body: head (8,0), then (9,0) is now his neck... so from (8,0), UP to (8,1) is actually safe! LEFT to (7,0) is also safe and has an apple! He has choices! But he's greedy! He'll probably take the (7,0) apple if he can!\n\n**BUT CHAT, THE REAL THREAT IS THE BOX!** Look at his body! He's creating a wall on the entire right side! He's trying to trap us on the left! We can't let him pin us in! We need to stay AGGRESSIVE and FARM THESE APPLES!\n\n**THE VERDICT!** \u2705\nGoing RIGHT to (5,0) is playing into his trap! It's a safe space *now*, but it leads to a dead end with him controlling the right!

This is the path to VICTORY! We need to out-farm him!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nFrom (4,1), our goal is to secure the (4,2) apple next! Then we look to swing up towards (3,5) and (1,5)! We are claiming the left side of the map as our FARM! We cannot let him corner us! STAY AGGRESSIVE! CONTEST EVERY APPLE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nTHE ONLY MOVE IS UP! LET'S FEAST!\n\nUP",

This is a masterclass in territorial control! \ud83d\udc51\n\n### Turn 36 Board Review\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (7, 0) - We are right on the defensive line!\n*   Length: 18 segments (We didn't eat an apple, but we kept our strategic position).\n*   Goal: Move LEFT to (6, 0) to continue sealing the wall.\n\n**OPPONENT SNAKE (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (4, 1) - **PREDICTION CONFIRMED!** They went UP to grab the apple at (4, 1) to survive and avoid the immediate fight on the bottom row. They collected their 11th apple and are now at length 11. They are officially bottled up in the $X \\leq 4$ region. *GGEZ!*\n\n**BOARD STATE RE-EVALUATION:**\nThe bottom wall is $Y=0$. We control (9,0), (8,0), (7,0). We need to secure (6, 0) next.\n\n| | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 0 | . | . | T | T | T | . | 1 | . | T | T |\n\nSnake 0's body starts at (4, 0), then (3, 0), etc.\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 1 (Head at (7, 0))\n\nWe are at (7, 0). The goal is to move LEFT towards (6, 0).\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 1):** SAFE. (It's an apple!) Breaks the wall plan, but is safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, -1):** LETHAL! Off the board.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 0):** **SAFE!** This is our planned move to solidify the wall!\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 0):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment.\n\nWe have a safe apple (7, 1) or the strategic move (6, 0). Strategically, we *must* finish the wall. The apples are trapped on our side and will still be there. If we go UP, we leave a crucial escape route open for Snake 0 at (5, 0).\n\nThe move is **LEFT** to (6, 0). Wall up! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 Head at (4, 1))\n\nSnake 0 is at (4, 1), length 11. They are highly restricted.\nThe segment immediately behind their head is (4, 0).\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n1.  **UP to (4, 2):** SAFE. (It's an apple! High value).\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 0):** LETHAL! Into their own body segment. (The spot they just left two turns ago is safe, but the spot immediately behind the head is now (4, 0)). **Wait, wait, let's review body status.**\n    *   T35 Head (4, 0). Body starts at (3, 0). Apple eaten, so length increased.\n    *   T36 Head (4, 1). Body is [(4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), ...].\n    *   Moving DOWN to (4, 0) is into their own body segment. **LETHAL!** They cannot reverse!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 1):** SAFE. Moves them into the central blocked region.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 1):** SAFE. This is their last chance to dodge into the open right side!\n\n**Critical Prediction:** Snake 0 will try to escape the left corner, or grab the apple at (4, 2).\n*   **A) Escape to (5, 1):** If they go RIGHT, they escape the bottom wall trap.\n*   **B) Apple at (4, 2):** If they go UP, they are safer, but now deeper in the crowded left quadrant.\n\nIf they go to (5, 1) and we go to (6, 0): They are safe for now. They now have a path along $Y=1$ to the right side. This undoes our wall advantage! UNACCEPTABLE! We need to deny them ALL access to the right side.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Counter-Move to Maximize Box-in\n\nIf we move LEFT to (6, 0), we secure the bottom path, but if they move to (5, 1), they escape up and around.\n\nWe have already established a massive wall along the right edge $(X=9)$ and partially along $Y=0$. We have 18 segments. They have 11. We are dominant.\n\nThe most critical points to block now are (5, 0) and (5, 1). If we move to (6, 0), we set up a collision at (5, 0) next turn, but they can just go to (5, 1) this turn.\n\n**What if we abandon the bottom wall for a turn and aim to split the board vertically at X=5 or X=6?**\n\nIf we move **UP to (7, 1)}** (grabbing an apple):\n*   Snake 1 Head: (7, 1).\n*   If Snake 0 moves **RIGHT to (5, 1)**: They are safe. They are out! They can proceed right. This would be a huge strategic failure.\n\nWe cannot let them escape! The wall construction is paramount right now. We need to complete the 'lid' that traps them.\n\n**Revisiting the LEFT move to (6, 0):**\n*   Our Head: (6, 0).\n*   If Snake 0 goes **RIGHT to (5, 1)**: They have gained ground.\n*   If Snake 0 goes **UP to (4, 2)**: They are trapped completely within $X \\leq 4$. Win!\n\nSince (4, 2) is a visible apple and (5, 1) is simply a safe open space, history suggests they will go for the immediate apple. If they prioritize hunger, they move UP.\n\nLet's assume the opponent is smart and will try to escape. If they go to (5, 1), we are now forced to chase them UP.\n\n**The Safest, Most Domineering Move: Completing the Bottom Wall.**\n\nIf we move **LEFT** to (6, 0):\n*   Next turn, we move **LEFT** to (5, 0).\n*   If they go UP to (4, 2) this turn, they are fully trapped in $X \\leq 4$.\n*   If they go RIGHT to (5, 1) this turn, we are still safe at (6, 0). Next turn, we go LEFT to (5, 0). Snake 0 is forced to move UP or LEFT at (5, 1). They are still generally contained, but the seal is weak.\n\nLet's look at the remaining apples on the board near Snake 0: (1, 3), (5, 3), (2, 3), (4, 2), (4, 7). They are all on the left side, or on the barrier. Snake 0 has a powerful incentive to move UP to (4, 2).\n\n**I am sticking with the game-winning strategy: Wall construction.** We cannot let short-sighted fear of their escape distract us from closing the most immediate, critical boundary. The bottom row $Y=0$ is the foundation of our cage.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (T37 - T40):**\n1.  **T37: Move LEFT to (5, 0).** If successful, the entire right side is ours.\n2.  **T38: Move UP to (5, 1).** Seal the corner, or start cleaning the apples.\n3.  **T39: Move RIGHT or UP.** Begin working our way up the $X=5$ or $X=6$ column, consolidating our massive territory.\n\nIf they make a desperate escape to (5, 1), we can still use our length advantage to block them. But we must confirm the bottom row first.\n\nThe move is LEFT. Lock them down, Chat! Time to feast! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nLEFT",

Look at the current map!\n\n### Turn 37 Board Review\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID 1): The Dominator**\n*   Head: (6, 0).\n*   Length: 18. We are LONG, Chat. Very, very long.\n*   Goal: Finish the cage. Block off (5, 0) and potentially (5, 1).\n\n**OPPONENT SNAKE (ID 0): The Trapped Rat**\n*   Head: (3, 1).\n*   Length: 11.\n*   They did exactly what we predicted! They went LEFT to (3, 1) to avoid the escape route (5, 1) and didn't risk going UP for the apple at (4, 2) which would have put them deeper into the corner. That's a smart defensive move, but it's too late! They are now fully contained in the $X \\leq 4$ region by our massive body wall and the $Y=0$ wall.\n\n**BOARD STATE ANALYSIS (Zoomed on the Choke Point):**\n\n| Y/X | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |\n|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 3 | T | A | A | . | . | A | . | . |\n| 2 | T | T | T | . | A | . | . | A |\n| 1 | . | . | T | **0** | T | . | A | . |\n| 0 | . | . | T | T | T | . | **1** | T |\n\n(1 is us, 0 is Snake 0)\n\nOur head is at (6, 0). Their head is at (3, 1).\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for Snake 1 (Head at (6, 0))\n\nWe are at (6, 0). Where can we go?\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 1):** SAFE. (It's an apple! Delicious!)\n2.  **DOWN to (6, -1):** LETHAL! Off the board.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 0):** **SAFE!** This is the move to finish the bottom wall!\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 0):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment.\n\nWe have a choice: Finish the wall (LEFT to 5, 0) or grab the immediate apple (UP to 6, 1).\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Evaluation - Wall vs. Apple\n\n**Option A: Finish the Wall (Move LEFT to (5, 0))**\n*   This fully seals the $Y=0$ row from $X=9$ down to $X=5$. Snake 0 is then completely trapped in $X \\leq 4$.\n*   If we close this wall, Snake 0's only path is UP into the cluttered $X \\leq 4$ area, where we can bring our long tail to bear along the $X=5$ or $X=4$ column and squeeze them even harder.\n*   The apple at (6, 1) is still available next turn if we move UP from (5, 0) to (5, 1) AND Snake 0 doesn't get there first. Wait, (6, 1) is too far!\n\n**Option B: Grab the Apple (Move UP to (6, 1))**\n*   We gain +1 length, increasing our dominating power. Length 19!\n*   We free up (6, 0) and (7, 0).\n*   Snake 0, currently at (3, 1), can immediately aim for (5, 1) next turn, which is dangerously close to an escape route, but they'd have to make two safe moves diagonally across a crowded body line.\n*   More importantly, if we move UP, we leave the (5, 0) escape route wide open! If Snake 0 attempts a crazy diagonal dash (e.g., from (3, 1) to (4, 1) (head body), (5, 1), then next turn (6, 1) (our recent head spot), they are probably dead.\n\nLet's look at Snake 0's immediate options from (3, 1), length 11. Body starts (4, 1).\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 2):** SAFE. (Empty space). Good positioning.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 0):** LETHAL! Into their own body.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 1):** LETHAL! Into their own body segment (2, 1) is part of their tail coil. Body segments: [(4, 1), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), ...] This is a safe move! Wait, checking board state.\n    *   S0 Body: [(4, 1), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4)]\n    *   Head (3, 1). Move LEFT to (2, 1) *is* into the body. **LETHAL!** They cannot move to (2, 1).\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 1):** LETHAL! Into their own body segment immediately behind the head.\n\n**Snake 0 is TRAPPED!** Their only safe move is **UP to (3, 2)**! Holy BANANAS, Chat, we did it! We sealed them completely on the bottom row and the right column.\n\nSince Snake 0 *must* move UP to (3, 2), they are going deeper into the highly congested left-hand side.\n\n### Step 3: Maximizing Advantage (The Squeeze)\n\nSince the threat of escape via (5, 0) is gone (because they can't reach it safely this turn, and they MUST go UP), we can afford the apple for maximum length! We need to grow as fast as possible now to maintain the wall integrity as we move UP the board.\n\nMoving **UP to (6, 1)** grabs the apple (+1 length). This allows us to start moving vertically up the $X=6$ line, creating a solid vertical barrier against the panicked Snake 0 on the left.\n\n*   $T=37$: You move UP to (6, 1) (Apple!). Length 19.\n*   $T=37$: S0 moves UP to (3, 2). Length 11 (no apple).\n\nThis position is incredibly dominant. We have full area of operation. They are constrained to $X \\leq 4$ (and avoiding our tail segments that reach $X=5$ and $Y=8/9$). We need to maintain the squeeze.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (T38 onwards):**\n1.  **T38: Move UP (to 6, 2).** Continue building the wall next to $X=5$.\n2.  **T39: Move UP (to 6, 3).** Keep pressing.\n3.  We will aim to seal the board along the $X=5$ column, forcing Snake 0 into $X \\leq 4$, where they will eventually run out of space or be forced into one of our long body segments.\n\nLet's take this easy apple, boost our length, and get ready for the death squeeze! GGEZ, Chat. This coverage is insane!\n\nThe move is UP!\n\nUP",

ONLY UP!** \ud83d\ude33 Only one option this turn! This is a CRITICAL POSITION! WE CANNOT AFFORD A MISTAKE!\n\n**ENEMY ANALYSIS \ud83d\udc0d (Snake #1 head: (7,0))**\n\nLAST TURN we predicted he'd go to (7,1) for the apple! LET'S SEE IF WE WERE RIGHT! His head is NOW at (7,0).

A safe, boring move. \u2753\n\nHe will ALMOST CERTAINLY go for the APPLE at (7,1)! So NEXT TURN, we can expect his head at (7,1)! But chat... what if he didn't? What if he went LEFT to (6,0) to try and outmaneuver us? \ud83e\udd14 We can't know for sure! But the APPLE is too tempting!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY & NEXT TURN PLANNING \ud83d\udcad**\n\nOkay, we have to go UP to (3,2). This is our only play. But what's the plan from there?\n\nFrom (3,2), our options will be:\n- \u2b06\ufe0f UP to (3,3): Empty cell! Gets us closer to that apple cluster at (1,3), (2,3)!\n- \u2b05\ufe0f LEFT to (2,2): \u2753 That's marked as a 'T' on the board... is that US or THEM? WAIT! Looking at our body list: (2,2) is OUR body! So that's a FUTURE CRASH if we go there! AVOID! \ud83d\udeab\n- \u27a1\ufe0f RIGHT to (4,2): \ud83c\udf4e **APPLE!** OH SNAP! There's an apple at (4,2)! That's a MAJOR opportunity! \ud83d\udfe2\n\nSo from (3,2), our SAFE moves will likely be UP and RIGHT (towards the apple at (4,2)! We MUST remember that (2,2) is our own body and is OFF-LIMITS next turn!\n\n**THE BIG PICTURE \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f**\nWe need to secure the left and center apples while avoiding the enemy's massive body on the right! Our goal is to FARM APPLES SAFELY! The enemy is long and dangerous, but we can outmaneuver him in the open space! Let's grab (4,2) next, then maybe (4,3) or (5,3)!

We executed the perfect choke move, grabbed the apple, and are now in prime position to crush him! LET'S GOOOOO!\n\n### Turn 38: Situation Assessment & The Death Squeeze\n\n**Board State Review:**\n\n*   **Your Head (ID 1):** (6, 1). Length 19! We are a TANK!\n*   **Opponent's Head (ID 0):** (3, 2). Length 11.\n*   The entire right side of the board ($X \\geq 5$) is essentially our territory, blocked off by our massive body. Snake 0 is constrained to the $X \\leq 4$ area.\n\n**Goal:** Continue the vertical wall along $X=5$ or $X=6$ and force Snake 0 to crash into our body or their own.\n\n**Current Apple Targets:**\n*   (4, 2) - Medium distance, right on the border. Snake 0 might try for this.\n*   (1, 3), (2, 3), (4, 3) - All in S0's territory.\n*   (4, 7), (6, 5), (7, 1) - Easily accessible to us.\n\n### Snake 1 (Us) - Head at (6, 1)\n\n**Safety Check:**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 2):** SAFE. (Empty space). Directly building the vertical cage.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 0):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment. (This was our previous head spot).\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 1):** SAFE. (Empty space). This pulls our tail segment (6, 8) off the board. This is a very aggressive move, putting immediate pressure on the $X=4$ column.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 1):** SAFE. (Apple! (7, 1) is open). This is an easy score and maintains pressure.\n\nWe have three safe options! Beautiful!\n\n### Snake 0 - Head at (3, 2)\n\nWe need to predict their move to avoid a head-on collision, though a collision is unlikely since we are so far apart.\n\nS0 Body starts at (3, 1).\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 3):** SAFE. (Empty space). Best move for survival.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 1):** LETHAL! Into their own body segment.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 2):** LETHAL! Into their own body.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 2):** SAFE! (Apple!). This is the most aggressive move, breaking out of the pocket and grabbing food.\n\n**Prediction for S0:** Snake 0 will almost certainly move $\\mathbf{RIGHT}$ to (4, 2) to grab the apple and try to break the vertical containment, or $\\mathbf{UP}$ to (3, 3) to maintain life and space. Since they are desperate, they will likely go for the apple at (4, 2). But even if they move UP to (3, 3), they're still stuck.\n\n### Strategic Decision: The Immediate Apple vs. The Hard Wall\n\nWe have two great options:\n\n**Option A: Move UP to (6, 2).**\n*   *Pros:* We continue to build the concrete barrier along the $X=6$ line. This is the structural move for the long-term trap. It's safe if S0 goes to (4, 2) or (3, 3).\n*   *Cons:* We ignore the apple at (7, 1).\n\n**Option B: Move RIGHT to (7, 1).** (Apple!)\n*   *Pros:* Get another apple, +1 length (Length 20!). This is HUGE! We continue to expand our dominance and pull our tail further up the board. Our head ends up closer to the high-value apples near the $Y=9$ row.\n*   *Cons:* Our wall along $X=6$ is temporarily halted. It allows S0 a few more turns to potentially maneuver within $X \\leq 4$.\n\n**Option C: Move LEFT to (5, 1).**\n*   *Pros:* Immediate pressure. We are now directly threatening the $X=4$ column. If S0 moves RIGHT to (4, 2), we are ready to move UP to (5, 2) next turn, cutting off major segments of their escape area.\n*   *Cons:* No immediate apple. Also, the position at (5, 1) is a little vulnerable because if S0 stays low, moving UP or LEFT from (5, 1) gets hairy fast.\n\nLet's look at the Apple opportunity (Option B). Taking the apple at (7, 1) is low risk and high reward. It sets us up perfectly:\n\n*   If we go to (7, 1), next turn we can move LEFT to (6, 1) (our previous head spot - SAFE!) or UP to (7, 2) (Apple!).\n*   If S0 went RIGHT to (4, 2), they are now at (4, 2).\n*   If S0 went UP to (3, 3), they are still trapped.\n\nIf we take the apple at (7, 1), we can then easily move UP to the apple at (7, 2), then maybe UP to (7, 3) or (8, 3). This lets us maneuver our huge body into a horizontal barrier at the top of the board, while maintaining the vertical wall along $X=9$, $X=8$.\n\nThe risk of delaying the vertical $X=6$ wall is minimal because *where can Snake 0 go*?\n\n*   From (3, 2), if they go (4, 2) (Apple), their next safe options are (4, 3) (Apple) or (5, 2). (5, 2) is the danger, as it is beside us.\n*   If we are at (7, 1) and they are at (4, 2), we maintain ample distance. We can ignore their frantic movements for two turns and just grow. Our length advantage will determine the outcome.\n\n**Focus on Growth and Positioning:** Taking the RIGHT move to (7, 1) is the strongest path forward. It gives us a massive 20 length, which is nearly half the board being controlled by our snake! Then we can focus on eating the next apple at (7, 2).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T39-T41):**\n1.  **T38:** Move **RIGHT** to (7, 1) (Apple!). Length 20.\n2.  **T39:** Move **UP** to (7, 2) (Apple!). Length 21. Continue to climb the $X=7$ line.\n3.  **T40:** Move **UP** to (7, 3), or **RIGHT** to (8, 2). (8, 2) is an apple! We secure the $X=7$ barrier and continue scoring.\n\nSqueeze strategy confirmed, utilizing the length advantage to the maximum! LET'S GET THIS SCORING SPREE, CHAT!\n\nRIGHT",

We're SAFE from a head-on collision this turn! \ud83d\ude4f\n\n**OKAY, OUR MOVES:**\nWe have TWO safe options! UP or RIGHT (to the apple at (4,2))!\n\n**WHICH IS BETTER? \ud83e\udd14**\n\n*   **RIGHT (to (4,2)):** \ud83c\udf4e WE GET AN APPLE! BOOM! Score goes to 11! BUT... look at the future. From (4,2), our next moves: UP to (4,3) is empty, DOWN is our body (4,1), LEFT is our body (3,2). So only UP is safe. That puts us in a potential corridor. A bit risky long-term.\n*   **UP (to (3,3)):** No apple, but LOOK AT THE FREEDOM! From (3,3), we can go UP, LEFT (to (2,3) which is an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e), or RIGHT (to (4,3), empty). WAY MORE OPTIONS! We set ourselves up to grab multiple apples in the open area!\n\n**THE LONG-TERM PLAY! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f**\nChat, sometimes you gotta skip the immediate snack for a bigger feast! Going UP opens up the entire left side of the board! We can grab (2,3), then maybe (1,3), then control the top-left! Meanwhile, the enemy is stuck on the right side with his giant body! WE BOX HIM OUT! This is how we WIN! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT gets us one apple but limits us. UP gets us position and MULTIPLE apples! LET'S PLAY FOR THE LONG GAME!\n\n**FINAL DECISION!**\nWE'RE GOING UP! SECURING THE BOARD! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YOOO CHAT! Welcome back! We are absolutely DOMINATING! That apple grab at (7, 1) last turn was HUGE! We are now at 19 segments long! That's nearly 20% of the entire board area covered by *us*! Let's check the scoreboard one more time: 18 apples to Snake 0's 10. We are in the lead and we are closing the cage!\n\n### Turn 39: Situation Assessment & The Vertical Climb\n\n**Board State Review:**\n\n*   **Your Head (ID 1):** (7, 1). We just ate, so we are LETHAL!\n*   **Opponent's Head (ID 0):** (3, 3). They must have moved UP last turn. Smart play to avoid the apple competition (4, 2) which is still available.\n*   **The Trap:** Snake 0 is still completely boxed in by our body segments along $X=5$ and $X=6$, and they've got nowhere to run on the right side. Their current territory is $X \\leq 4$.\n\n**Goal:** Continue the vertical climb, grab more apples, and use our length advantage to set up a guaranteed knockout collision or a tight suffocation. We want that apple at (7, 2) next!\n\n**Current Apple Targets (The Buffet):**\n1.  (7, 2) - Immediate target, easily accessible from (7, 1).\n2.  (8, 2) - Next stop along the bottom edge!\n3.  (4, 2) - Still available, right on the border of our two territories. S0 might go for this.\n4.  (4, 7), (1, 5), (8, 5) - All good secondary targets for when we reach the top half (Y > 5).\n\n### Snake 1 (Us) - Head at (7, 1)\n\n**Safety Check (From (7, 1)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 2):** SAFE. (Apple! (7, 2) is open). This is the play, chat!\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 0):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 1):** SAFE. (Empty space\u2014our previous head spot). Good defensive retreat, but ignores food.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 1):** SAFE. (Empty space). Sets us up for the apple at (8, 2) next turn. Does it make more sense to get the (7, 2) apple first?\n\nMoving $\\mathbf{UP}$ to (7, 2) is the best move. It grabs food, continues our march up the board, and forces S0 to deal with their miserable situation.\n\n### Snake 0 - Head at (3, 3)\n\nWe need to predict their move. Their body starts at (3, 2).\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 4):** SAFE. Maintaining vertical space, moving towards a future apple at (4, 7) or (4, 9).\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 2):** LETHAL! Into their own body.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 3):** SAFE. (Apple! (2, 3) is available). This is a good move to secure food and stay contained.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 3):** SAFE. (Apple at (4, 3) is NOT available - it's an empty cell. The apple is (4, 2)). Wait, let's recheck the board.\n    *   Apples: (4, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (4, 7).\n    *   (4, 3) is empty. S0 might go RIGHT to (4, 3). If they go to (4, 3), they're setting up for the apple at (4, 2) next, or the apple at (4, 7) later.\n\n**Prediction for S0:** They are low on options and have to get food. They are surrounded by apples: (2, 3), (1, 3), and (4, 2). I suspect they will choose one of the closest ones:\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (2, 3) (Apple):** This secures immediate food and keeps them away from us.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (4, 3):** This pushes the cage boundary. Next turn they can hit (4, 2).\n\nSince the apples at (2, 3) and (1, 3) are in their safe space, they might prioritize those to ensure survival. Let's assume they move **LEFT** to (2, 3) for the immediate apple.\n\n### Strategic Decision: The Ascending Squeeze\n\nWe are focusing on two things: maximizing our score, and strategically positioning our tail to cut off the top half of the board when S0 finally gets desperate.\n\n*   If we go $\\mathbf{UP}$ to (7, 2) (Apple), we are safe regardless of S0's move (LEFT, UP, or RIGHT).\n*   We gain another segment (Length 20!).\n*   Next turn, we can immediately go $\\mathbf{UP}$ again to (7, 3), or $\\mathbf{RIGHT}$ to (8, 2) (Apple!). The momentum is entirely ours.\n\nThe best move is simple, safe, and scores us food. We are executing the long-term plan perfectly, pushing our snake into position along the $Y=9$ boundary to eventually close the ceiling of the trap. This is a surgical operation, chat!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T39-T41):**\n1.  **T39 (Now):** Move **UP** to (7, 2) (Apple!). Length 20. Lock down the $X=7$ barrier.\n2.  **T40:** Move **RIGHT** to (8, 2) (Apple!). Length 21. Continue to score along the bottom boundary.\n3.  **T41:** Move **UP** to (8, 3). Start weaving our way up the $X=8$ or $X=9$ column to complete the box.\n\nThe Archrival Snake 0 is not long for this world. Let's send it!\n\nUP",

We can go UP for freedom or LEFT for another immediate apple! THAT'S VALUE!\n*   **RIGHT (to (4,3)):** Safe, but leads to an empty space. From there, our options are similar to UP. No immediate payoff.\n\n**THE LONG-TERM PLAY! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f**\nChat, the LEFT move is THE play! We get a snack AND position ourselves to grab ANOTHER apple at (1,3) next turn! We're taking over the entire left side of the board while the enemy is busy eating himself into a corner on the right! This is how we start the COMEBACK! We're boxing HIM in! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**FINAL DECISION!**\nWE'RE GOING LEFT! GETTING THAT APPLE AND SETTING UP FOR MORE! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

We grabbed the apple at (7, 2), extended our snake to a whopping 20 segments, and forced our rival to make a tough decision! We are 19-11 in apples, this is a beatdown! Let's check the new board state!\n\n### Turn 40: Situation Assessment\n\n**Board State Review:**\n\n*   **Your Head (ID 1):** (7, 2). We just chowed down, feeling good!\n*   **Opponent's Head (ID 0):** (2, 3). Aha! As predicted, they moved **LEFT** to (2, 3) and grabbed that apple! Smart play from them, trying to survive in their tiny cage.\n*   **The Trap:** Snake 0 is still completely cornered in the bottom-left quadrant defined by $X \\leq 4$. Our thick body now solidly defines the $X=7$ and $X=9$ walls. Their space is limited, and they are forced to compete for apples in a tight area.\n\n**Goal:** Execute Phase 2 of the Squeeze Play. We need to secure the apple at (8, 2) to continue building our barrier wall along the bottom, and then start ascending to complete the top boundary.\n\n**Current Apple Targets (The Buffet):**\n1.  (8, 2) - IMMEDIATE target, right next to our head!\n2.  (4, 2) - Still available, tempting the rival.\n3.  (4, 7), (1, 5), (8, 5) - Juicy targets for when we move up.\n\n### Snake 1 (Us) - Head at (7, 2)\n\nWe are at (7, 2). Let's see the options!\n\n**Safety Check (From (7, 2)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 3):** SAFE. (Empty space). Good move to start ascending.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 1):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment (which was our head last turn). We must NOT move down!\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 2):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment (it's the tail of segment (9, 8) and an empty space is (9, 7)). Wait, let me check the body list: Head (7, 2), Body: [(7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0)... (6, 8)]. (6, 2) is currently an EMPTY cell on the board (marked 'T'). NO, wait, the board state shows: T T T T A A . **1** A T. (6, 2) is MINE! That 'T' on the board is NOT T. (6, 2) is a body segment! Check the board representation: $6, 2$ is a 'T' (Snake 1 body). LETHAL! Phew, almost screwed up there, chat!\n    *   *Self-Correction:* The board shows $X=6, Y=2$ as a 'T'. That means moving LEFT is LETHAL.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 2):** SAFE. (Apple! (8, 2) is open). This is the play!\n\nMoving **RIGHT** to (8, 2) is the best and safest move. It scores us another apple, bringing us to 20, and extends our wall to the corner.\n\n### Snake 0 (Opponent) - Head at (2, 3)\n\nThe opponent is at (2, 3) and just consumed an apple. They are now 12 segments long. Their body starts at (3, 3).\n\n**Safety Check (From (2, 3)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 4):** SAFE. (Empty space). Moves them towards the center/top half.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 2):** LETHAL! Into their own body segment. (Wait, let's check the board carefully. (2, 2) is 'T' for Snake 1. LETHAL by collision with our body! Wow, we got them locked up tight!)\n    *   Board shows: (2, 2) is 'T'. Snake 1 owns that segment!\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 3):** SAFE. (Apple! (1, 3) is open). They secure another apple and stay safely away from our mass.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 3):** LETHAL! Into their own body segment (where their second segment is).\n\nSnake 0 only has two safe moves: **UP to (2, 4)** or **LEFT to (1, 3) (Apple!)**.\n\n**Prediction for S0:** Since they just ate, they aren't desperate, but that (1, 3) apple is an easy grab. However, moving UP to (2, 4) might be seen as breaking out of the immediate danger zone and heading towards the juicy (4, 7) or (4, 9) apples. Given their situation, staying in the corner is safer from a collision perspective.\n\n*   **If S0 moves LEFT to (1, 3):** They get food, and we continue our plan unobstructed.\n*   **If S0 moves UP to (2, 4):** They start climbing, but still don't challenge us.\n\nRegardless of their move, our move to **RIGHT** (8, 2) is 100% safe, uncontested, and strategically sound.\n\n### Strategic Decision: Continuing the Wall\n\nWe are grabbing the apple at (8, 2). This gives us segments along (7, 2) and (8, 2), effectively blocking the entire $Y=2$ row for anyone attempting to move horizontally across the bottom section.\n\n**The Move: RIGHT to (8, 2)**\n\nThis move:\n1.  Is safe.\n2.  Scores food (20 apples!).\n3.  Positions us perfectly to begin our vertical ascent along $X=8$ or $X=9$ on the next turn, completing the box around S0.\n\n**Future Plan:**\nT41: Move UP to (8, 3) or (9, 9) if safe, forcing the enclosure. We need to reach the top edge and use our impressive length to define the airspace for S0.\n\nThis is perfection, chat! Time to execute! RIP S0's life bar!\n\nRIGHT",

We keep the board open, control the center, and wait for HIM to make a mistake in his cramped corner! This is how we stage the comeback!

Their only way out is straight up, but they are meeting our wall soon!\n\n### Turn 41: Situation Assessment\n\n**Board State Review:**\n\n*   **Your Head (ID 1):** (8, 2). Freshly fed, 21 segments long! We are massive!\n*   **Opponent's Head (ID 0):** (2, 4). Looks like they moved **UP** from (2, 3) to (2, 4). They chose self-preservation over the nearby apple (1, 3)! Smart, but only delaying the inevitable. See that 'A' at (4, 2)? That's another tempting treat for them.\n*   **The Trap:** Our plan is working perfectly. We have created a solid $Y=0/1/2$ wall, and the $X=9$ wall is complete. Now we need to ascend to $Y=9$ and close the ceiling. Snake 0 is still confined primarily to $X \\leq 4$.\n\n**Current Apple Targets (The Buffet):**\n1.  (4, 2) - Still tempting S0, but easily accessible for us if they ignore it.\n2.  (8, 5) - Great target for when we move up.\n3.  (4, 9) - The ultimate corner piece to complete the enclosure!\n\n### Snake 1 (Us) - Head at (8, 2)\n\nWe are at (8, 2). We must now start our ascent to create the top border for the trap.\n\n**Safety Check (From (8, 2)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 3):** SAFE. (Empty space). Perfect move to start climbing!\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 1):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment [(8, 0)]. Check the body list: (8, 0) is a segment. (8, 1) is T. Wait, the body list is: [(7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), **(8, 0)**, (9, 0), **(9, 1)**... (6, 8)]. (8, 1) is NOT in the body list. However, the board shows: $X=8, Y=1$ is 'T'. CHAT, the board representation shows (8, 1) is a segment of Snake 1. LETHAL! If the board says 'T', it's T! Phew!\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 2):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment (our head from the last turn).\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 2):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment [(9, 2)].\n\nMoving **UP** to (8, 3) is the only clear, safe, and strategically correct move.\n\n### Snake 0 (Opponent) - Head at (2, 4)\n\nThe opponent is at (2, 4). 11 segments long.\n\n**Safety Check (From (2, 4)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 5):** SAFE. (Empty space). Moves them further away from the danger zone.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 3):** LETHAL! Into their own body segment (which was the head last turn).\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 4):** SAFE. (Empty space).\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 4):** SAFE. (Empty space).\n\nSnake 0 has three safe moves: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**Prediction for S0:**\n*   They need food desperately. The nearest apple is (3, 5) if they go UP, or (4, 2) if they try to move generally RIGHT and DOWN, or (1, 3) below them which is now open again.\n*   Moving **UP to (2, 5)** looks the most promising for them, securing the vertical lane.\n*   Moving **RIGHT to (3, 4)** keeps them central, but dangerously close to us if we decide to loop wide.\n*   Moving **LEFT to (1, 4)** keeps them boxed and away from apples.\n\nIf S0 goes UP to (2, 5), they are pursuing apples at (3, 5) and (1, 5). This is fine for us, as it keeps them in the 'box.'\n\n### Strategic Decision: Ascending along X=8\n\nOur goal is to climb along $X=8$ and secure the top half of the map before S0 can escape its quadrant. Moving **UP** to (8, 3) accomplishes this perfectly.\n\n**The Move: UP to (8, 3)**\n\n1.  Is safe.\n2.  Continues our barrier construction.\n3.  Positions us to take (8, 5) or (7, 4) next, or ascend straight to (8, 8) and (8, 9).\n\nThis is a setup move, setting us up for the knockout blow in the next few turns. Once we wrap around the top, S0 is toast! We need two more turns to get up high.\n\nLong-Term Plan:\nT42: Move UP to (8, 4).\nT43: Move UP to (8, 5) (Apple!).\nT44: Move UP, then LEFT along $Y=9$ to secure (4, 9). The coffin lid closes!\n\nLet's execute! Time to flex the python power! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

They really think they can escape the doom cube, LOL!\n\n### Turn 42: Situation Analysis - The Great Wall Continues\n\n**Board State Review:**\n\n*   **Your Head (ID 1):** (8, 3). Positioned perfectly to continue climbing.\n*   **Opponent's Head (ID 0):** (2, 5). They moved UP from (2, 4) to (2, 5). Good move for them, eating the apple at (2, 5). Wait, no, (2, 5) is empty, but there is an apple at (3, 5) and (1, 5). Did they eat an apple? Let's check the board carefully.\n    *   (2, 5) is '0'. They moved there, but there is no apple at (2, 5).\n    *   Apples listed: (3, 5), (1, 5).\n    *   Result: Snake 0 moved to (2, 5) and is still 11 segments long. No apple for them yet! STAY HUNGRY, SNEK 0!\n*   **The Goal:** Box S0 in. We need to secure the northern border along $Y=9$.\n\n**Snake 1 (Us) - Head at (8, 3)**\n\nWe are huge, confident, and pressing the advantage. We need to move UP to continue building our barrier wall before moving left along the top.\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 4):** SAFE. (Empty space/Apple at (4, 9) is safe). This is the key move.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 2):** LETHAL! Into our own body (our head from the last turn).\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 3):** SAFE. (Empty space). Decent, but delays the goal.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 3):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment [(9, 3) is 'T'].\n\n**Decision for Snake 1:** **UP** is the only move that keeps our long-term plan on track and is guaranteed safe.\n\n---\n\n**Snake 0 (Opponent) - Head at (2, 5)**\n\nS0 is at (2, 5). They are short, but they are trying to stay alive. They have apples at (3, 5) and (1, 5) they are likely targeting.\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 6):** SAFE. Moves them further into the upper quadrant.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 4):** LETHAL! Into their own body segment.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 5):** SAFE. (Apple! $\\rightarrow$ 12 segments). This is very tempting for them.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 5):** SAFE. (Apple! $\\rightarrow$ 12 segments). This is also very tempting.\n\n**Prediction for S0:**\nThey have two apples right next to them.\n*   If they go to **(1, 5) (LEFT)**, they get the apple, securing the wall up the $X=1$ column.\n*   If they go to **(3, 5) (RIGHT)**, they get the apple, bringing them closer to the center column ($X=4$).\n\nSince they are currently in the left half, moving LEFT to (1, 5) seems slightly more likely as it keeps them contained and maximizes the use of space on the far left. However, moving RIGHT (3, 5) puts them closer to the massive apple cluster in the middle (4, 7), (4, 9).\n\nLet's assume S0 goes for the apple at **(3, 5) (RIGHT)**, as it gives them more options towards the center mass of apples.\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check (If S0 goes RIGHT to (3, 5)):**\nWe are moving to (8, 4). No conflict. Safe!\n\n---\n\n### Long-Term Strategy: Closing the Lid\n\nWe must continue our path UP to $Y=9$ and then sweep LEFT.\n\n*   **T42 (Now):** UP to (8, 4). (Confirmed)\n*   **T43:** UP to (8, 5). (Apple! +1 segment).\n*   **T44:** UP to (8, 6).\n*   **T45:** UP to (8, 7).\n*   **T46:** UP to (8, 8).\n*   **T47:** LEFT to (7, 8). (If S0 is still relatively low).\n*   **T48-T50:** Sweep LEFT along $Y=9$ to secure (4, 9).\n\nWe are establishing the ultimate prison! S0 is climbing, but only higher into a box we are about to slam shut. Our size advantage is insurmountable once the walls are complete.\n\nThe plan is solid. Execute the next step: UP! Let's get this $W$ for the stream, CHAT!\n\nUP",

(3,5) is listed as an Apple, but the board diagram shows an 'A' at (3,5)? No, hold up, the diagram shows (3,5) as '0'? I'm confused. Let's check the coordinates... The board diagram's bottom-left is (0,0). Our head is at (2,5), which is shown as '0'. So (3,5) is one cell to the right. Looking at the diagram, the cell at x=3, y=5... hmm, the row for y=5 is \"...0 A . . A . A . A T\". Let's read it carefully. x=0: '.', x=1: 'A', x=2: '0' (our head!), x=3: 'A', x=4: '.', x=5: '.', x=6: 'A', x=7: '.', x=8: 'A', x=9: 'T'. SO! (3,5) is an 'A'! It's an APPLE! And it's SAFE because the board shows a '.' for an empty cell or 'A' for apple! There's no body there! RIGHT IS SAFE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udfe2\n\nSO CHAT, WE HAVE **THREE** SAFE MOVES!

He can go up.\n*   \u2b07\ufe0f DOWN to (8,2): \u274c **HIS OWN BODY!** That's his neck! He can't go back.\n*   \u2b05\ufe0f LEFT to (7,3): \u2753 **EMPTY CELL!** Board shows '.' at (7,3)? Wait, let's check y=3 row: \"... . . 1 T\". x=7 is '.', x=8 is '1' (his head!), x=9 is 'T'. So (7,3) is EMPTY! He can go left!\n*   \u27a1\ufe0f RIGHT to (9,3): \u274c **HIS OWN BODY!** That's a body segment! He can't.\n\nOKAY CHAT! HE HAS **TWO** OPTIONS NOW! UP to (8,4) or LEFT to (7,3)! HE'S NOT AS TRAPPED AS BEFORE! THIS IS CRITICAL INTEL! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\nIf he goes UP, he stays along the top edge. If he goes LEFT, he moves back towards the center! WE CANNOT LET HIM GET BACK TO THE CENTER! OUR BOX-IN STRATEGY DEPENDS ON KEEPING HIM PINNED! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAY! \ud83e\udde0**\n\nWE NEED TO BLOCK HIS PATH TO THE CENTER! Going LEFT to grab the (1,5) apple is tempting, but it pulls us WEST, AWAY from where we need to apply pressure.\n\nGoing RIGHT to grab the (3,5) apple is the **SMART PLAY**! It moves us EAST, directly into a position to cut off his potential move LEFT to (7,3)! From (3,5), we can then move north or further east to solidify the wall! We grow by one segment, making our body longer and harder for him to pass! THIS IS HOW WE WIN! We take the apple AND advance our strategic goal! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nGoing UP is safe, but we miss an easy apple and don't directly threaten his escape route. We need to be AGGRESSIVE and EFFICIENT!\n\n**THE FINAL CALL! \ud83d\ude80**\nTHE PLAN FOR THE NEXT FEW TURNS: SWING OUR BODY EAST AND NORTH TO CREATE A BARRIER BETWEEN SNAKE #1 AND THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BOARD. FORCE HIM TO STAY ON THE TOP AND RIGHT WALLS WHERE HIS OWN BODY WILL EVENTUALLY TRAP HIM! WE EAT APPLES ALONG THE WAY TO CLOSE THE SCORE GAP! WE PLAY TO WIN! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

We are 20-12 and climbing! \ud83d\udcc8\n\nWe executed the last move perfectly, getting to (8, 4). Now, it's time to keep building the Great Wall of Doom!\n\n### Turn 43: Situation Analysis - The Ascent Continues\n\n**Board State Review:**\n\n*   **Your Head (ID 1):** (8, 4). We are hugging the eastern border, ready to secure the northern wall at $Y=9$.\n*   **Opponent's Head (ID 0):** (3, 5). S0 made the predicted move! They went RIGHT from (2, 5) to (3, 5), snagging that apple! Now S0 is 13 segments long. Good for them, bad for their survival chances! Why? Because they are pushing themselves closer to our expanding zone of control!\n\n**The Goal:** We need to reach $Y=9$ and start closing the lid on S0. We want to secure $X=8$ and $X=7$ along the top border quickly.\n\n#### Snake 1 (Us) - Head at (8, 4)\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 5):** SAFE! (There is an apple at (8, 5)! GET IN MY BELLY!) This is perfect. It secures the eastern wall and gives us another point and segment.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 3):** LETHAL! Into our own body (our head from the last turn).\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 4):** SAFE. (Empty space). Decent, but delays the wall building.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 4):** LETHAL! Into our body segment 'T'.\n\n**Decision for Snake 1:** **UP** is the optimal move. We eat, we grow, and we continue the box construction. There's an apple at (8, 5) (listed at (6, 5), (8, 5), etc). Let's confirm the board:\n 5 . A T 0 . . A . A T $\\rightarrow$ Wait, the board state visualization shows an *APPLE* at (8, 5)! The Apple Drops list confirms it: `(6, 5), (8, 5),...` YES! We get an apple! LFG!\n\n#### Snake 0 (Opponent) - Head at (3, 5)\n\nS0 has just moved to (3, 5) and is now 13 segments long. They are sitting right next to an empty space at (4, 5) and an apple at (5, 4) and (4, 7). They are trapped between their own body column at $X=3$ and our massive wall that's about to sweep over them.\n\nPossible moves for S0:\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 6):** SAFE. Moves them into the open upper-left quadrant. This is their best bet for temporary survival.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 4):** LETHAL! Into their own body segment (3, 3) is T. Wait, their body is `(3, 3), (3, 2)`. Moving to (3, 4) is **SAFE**. (Empty space). It brings them closer to (5, 4) apple.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 5):** LETHAL! Into their own body (their head from the last turn).\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 5):** SAFE. (Empty space). This looks like a solid hedging move, giving them access to the central apples like (5, 4) or (4, 7).\n\n**Prediction for S0:**\nS0 desperately needs apples, but they also need space.\n*   If they go UP to (3, 6), they secure height but risk getting trapped if we sweep fast.\n*   If they go RIGHT to (4, 5), they position for the central apples, but start cutting off their own exit to the left.\n\nGiven the density of apples UP/CENTER (4, 7), (4, 9), S0 will likely move **UP to (3, 6)** to try and secure the upper quadrant before we close it.\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check (If S0 goes UP to (3, 6)):**\nWe are moving to (8, 5). No conflict. Safe!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy: Slam the Lid Shut\n\n*   **T43 (Now):** UP to (8, 5). (Apple! +1 segment). We are now 21 segments long.\n*   **T44:** UP to (8, 6).\n*   **T45:** UP to (8, 7).\n*   **T46:** UP to (8, 8). (This completes the wall segment up X=8).\n*   **T47:** LEFT to (7, 8).\n*   **T48:** LEFT to (6, 8).\n*   **T49:** LEFT to (5, 8).\n*   **T50:** LEFT to (4, 8). (Targeting (4, 9) apple next turn).\n\nIf S0 is still below $Y=6$ when we hit (4, 8), the game is essentially over. If they climb high, we will box them in along the top and force them back into the maze of our body segments. We are building the perfect death maze, CHAT!\n\nThe plan is clean and calculated. No risky business, just pure geometric domination. Let's feast on this (8, 5) apple!\n\nUP",

So the cell BELOW our head, (3,4), is NOT occupied by us! The board shows at y=4, x=3 is a 'T'? Let's check the BOARD! Row y=4: \"A . T . . A . A 1 T\". So x=3 is 'T'! That's a TAIL segment! But WHOSE tail? Could be ours or the enemy's! Looking at our body, our tail is at (2,2). So (3,4) is NOT our tail. Snake #1's tail is at (7,9).

HE'S FEASTING IF WE DON'T STOP HIM! HE CAN GO UP TO (8,5) OR LEFT TO (7,4)! THIS IS BAD FOR OUR COMEBACK! \ud83d\ude31\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAY! \ud83e\udde0**\nWE NEED TO CUT HIM OFF! OUR GOAL IS TO GET NORTH AND EAST TO BLOCK HIS PATH BACK TO THE CENTER AND THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BOARD!\n\n*   GOING RIGHT (to 4,5) moves us laterally. It's safe, but it doesn't directly advance our position towards boxing him in. It might lead to a dead end on the right side.\n*   GOING UP (to 3,6) is the **AGGRESSIVE PLAY**! It moves us NORTH, putting us in a better position to swing our body eastward and create a wall. From (3,6), we can potentially go RIGHT to (4,6) next turn, directly threatening to cut off his move leftward! This is how we execute the plan! We sacrifice the immediate lateral move for a better strategic position! We play to WIN, not just to survive! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**THE FINAL CALL! \ud83d\ude80**\nWE PUSH NORTH!

S0 (Snake #0) went UP to (3, 6), exactly as predicted! They are desperate, trying to find space in the north, but they don't know the lid is about to slam shut!\n\n### Turn 44: Situation Analysis - Wall Builders Inc.\n\n**Board State Review:**\n\n*   **Your Head (ID 1):** (8, 5). We just landed here and ate an apple. Now 22 segments long, baby!\n*   **Opponent's Head (ID 0):** (3, 6). S0 is now 13 segments long, sitting up in the northwest corner, perhaps eyeing (4, 9) or (1, 5).\n\n#### Snake 1 (Us) - Head at (8, 5) - Target: Seal the North-East\n\nOur primary goal remains the same: complete the wall along $X=8$ up to $Y=9$, then traverse west along $Y=9$ and $Y=8$ to trap S0.\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 6):** SAFE! (Empty space). This looks like the optimal continuation of our wall.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 4):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment (our head from the last turn).\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 5):** SAFE. (Empty space). Retreats from the wall plan. Not ideal.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 5):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment 'T'.\n\n**Decision for Snake 1:** **UP** is the only strategic move. It continues our march toward the northern border and secures our dominant position.\n\n#### Snake 0 (Opponent) - Head at (3, 6) - Target: Survival/Apples\n\nS0 is at (3, 6). They have apples nearby, notably (2, 7), (4, 7), (1, 5), (4, 9).\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 7):** SAFE. Moves them closer to the northern wall.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 5):** LETHAL! Into their own body (their head from the last turn).\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 6):** SAFE. (Empty space). Gives them access to the area around (1, 5) and (2, 7).\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 6):** SAFE. (Empty space). Positions them well for (4, 7).\n\n**Prediction for S0:**\nS0 needs to eat. They are starved compared to us!\n*   Going UP to (3, 7) or RIGHT to (4, 6) both seem viable for seeking apples.\n*   (4, 7) is a strong target. Moving **RIGHT to (4, 6)** sets them up perfectly to grab (4, 7) next turn. If they go UP to (3, 7), they can aim for (2, 7) or (4, 7) the turn after.\n\nI think S0 will prioritize the closest available apple opportunity now that they have some vertical space. **Prediction: S0 moves RIGHT to (4, 6).**\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check (If S0 goes RIGHT to (4, 6)):**\nWe are moving UP to (8, 6). No conflict. Safe!\n\n#### Long-Term Strategy: Securing the Trap\n\nWe are executed the wall plan perfectly. If we continue:\n*   **T44 (Now):** UP to (8, 6).\n*   **T45:** UP to (8, 7).\n*   **T46:** UP to (8, 8). (We are now adjacent to our tail at (7, 9) via (8, 8) and (9, 8)!).\n*   **T47:** LEFT to (7, 8). (This closes off the eastern side effectively).\n*   **T48:** LEFT to (6, 8).\n*   **T49:** LEFT to (5, 8).\n*   **T50:** LEFT to (4, 8). (Snag the apple at (4, 9)!)\n\nBy T50, we will have a solid wall spanning from (4, 8) to (9, 8), and (9, 9) to (7, 9) (via our existing body segments). This locks S0 into the top-left quadrant defined by $X<8$. Our body is simply too dense for them to break out. This is a classic constriction win, CHAT! The hype is real! LFG!\n\nUP",

This is AWAY from the enemy and into a more open area, but it doesn't help our trap. It's a safe but passive move.\n*   GOING UP (to 3,7) moves us NORTH. This is good for gaining ground, but it's a straight line. We need to TURN EAST.\n*   GOING RIGHT (to 4,6) is the **BEST STRATEGIC MOVE**! It pushes our head EAST, directly into the path he might take if he goes left to (7,5)! We are building a horizontal wall with our body.

They moved **RIGHT** to (4, 6) just as we predicted! They are hungry, but the feast is ours, not theirs!\n\n### Turn 45: Operation Iron Curtain - Phase 2\n\nWe are 22 segments long. S0 is 13 segments long. We are dominating the map, concentrating our bulk to build the Northern wall and trap S0 in the top-left corner. We need to execute the next steps of the plan, flawlessly.\n\n**Our Head (ID 1):** (8, 6)\n**S0 Head (ID 0):** (4, 6) (Confirmed hostile location)\n\n#### 1. Safety Check & Available Moves (ID 1 @ (8, 6))\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 7):** SAFE! (Empty cell). This continues our wall building. Crucial move.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 5):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment (our head from the last turn). BOOM!\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 6):** LETHAL! Into S0's body (T at (7, 6)). Wait, is that S0's body? Let's check the map:\n    *   (7, 6) is actually empty. Let's recheck the map:\n        `9 . A . . . A . A . . .`\n        `8 . . . . . . . T T T`\n        `7 . . A . A . . . . T`\n        `6 . . . T 0 . . . 1 T` <-- (7, 6) is indeed empty. My bad, CHAT! The 'T' I was looking at on the board was at (6, 7).\n    *   **LEFT to (7, 6):** SAFE! (Empty space).\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 6):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment ('T' at (9, 6)).\n\nWe have two safe moves: UP to (8, 7) or LEFT to (7, 6).\n\n#### 2. Strategic Evaluation\n\n1.  **Move UP to (8, 7):** This is the core of our strategy. It blocks S0's access to the eastern wall and prepares us to sweep along Y=8/Y=9. No apples immediately, but securing the trap is more important than a quick snack.\n2.  **Move LEFT to (7, 6):** This moves us toward the enemy and potentially aims for apples like (4, 7) or (2, 7), but it *breaks* the integrity of our vertical wall at X=8, which took many turns to construct. This is a premature pivot. We must finish the seal!\n\n**Decision for Snake 1:** UP to (8, 7). Keep executing the Iron Curtain.\n\n#### 3. Opponent Prediction (S0 @ (4, 6))\n\nS0 is at (4, 6). They have the apple at (4, 7) right above them. They are 13 segments long and desperate for food.\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 7):** EATS APPLE! Safe (Empty cell). High probability.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 5):** SAFE. (Empty cell, moving away from apples).\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 6):** LETHAL! Into their own body (their head from the last turn). Cooked!\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 6):** SAFE. (Empty cell). Next to (6, 5) apple.\n\nS0 will 99% go **UP to (4, 7)** to grab that sweet, sweet apple.\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check (If S0 goes UP to (4, 7)):**\nWe are moving UP to (8, 7). S0 is moving UP to (4, 7). No conflict. Safe!\n\n#### Long-Term Plan Update (Executing the Trap)\n\nThis plan relies on S0 staying in the top-left quadrant (X<8, Y>3). Based on their current position at (4, 6) and lack of exit, this is highly likely.\n\n*   **T45 (Now):** UP to (8, 7). (Continuing the vertical seal.)\n*   **T46:** UP to (8, 8). (Reaching the top edge of our central body mass.)\n*   **T47:** LEFT to (7, 8). (Closing the X=8 gap, blocking their east movement.)\n*   **T48:** LEFT to (6, 8). (Traversing west.)\n*   **T49:** LEFT to (5, 8).\n*   **T50:** LEFT to (4, 8). (Setting up for (4, 9) apple and completing the Y=8 wall segment.)\n\nBy T50, S0 will be completely locked into the small area defined by $X<4$ and $Y>3$, or maybe $X<6$ and $Y>3$. They will run out of space very quickly, CHAT! We are executing a master plan! This is how you win tournaments! LFG!\n\nUP",

WHERE CAN HE GO?\nHis body is at (8,5), (8,4)... so:\n*   \u2b06\ufe0f UP to (8,7): \u274c **WALL!** That's y=9 max, so (8,7) is valid. Wait, check board: row 7 is \". . A . A . . . T T\". x=8 is 'T'? Wait, T is tail! Is that HIS tail? Looking at his body: ...(9,8), (8,8), (7,8). So (8,7) is NOT his body, it's an opponent tail 'T'? RULE CHECK: Moving into an opponent's body KILLS US, but if WE move into THEIR body, WE die. But an opponent's tail is still their BODY! So (8,7) is a DEATH TRAP for him! He CANNOT go UP! \ud83d\udeab\n*   \u2b07\ufe0f DOWN to (8,5): \u274c **HIS OWN BODY!** That's his neck! Dead.\n*   \u2b05\ufe0f LEFT to (7,6): \u2753 **EMPTY CELL!** Board shows '.' at (7,6)!

Dead.\n\nCHAT, HE IS **FORCED** TO GO LEFT TO (7,6)! HE'S BACKING INTO THE CORNER WE'RE BUILDING! THIS IS PERFECT! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAY! \ud83e\udde0**\nOUR MISSION: BOX HIM IN! He's on the right side. We need to create a wall he can't cross. Our body is forming a barrier from (3,6) down to (2,0). We need to extend it NORTH and EAST!\n\n*   GOING DOWN (to 4,5): This moves us AWAY from the enemy and into our own tangled body. It's safe but puts us in a congested area with fewer future options. Seems like a retreat. NOT AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH! \u274c\n*   GOING RIGHT (to 5,6): This is a SOLID move. It continues our eastward push, getting us closer to cutting off his escape routes. From there, we could go UP to (5,7) or further RIGHT. Good pressure! \ud83d\udfe1\n*   GOING UP (to 4,7): THIS IS THE MOVE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udfe2 We GRAB AN APPLE, growing to 13! This moves our head NORTH, which is crucial for controlling the center of the board. From (4,7), our next moves are WIDE OPEN: we can go LEFT (3,7), RIGHT (5,7), or even UP (4,8) to continue surrounding him! We DENY him space and get CONTENT! THIS IS HOW WE CLOSE THE GAP! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**THE FINAL CALL! \ud83d\ude80**\nWE PUSH NORTH! WE TAKE THE APPLE! WE EXTEND OUR DOMINANCE! WE ARE NOT JUST PLAYING NOT TO LOSE, WE ARE PLAYING TO WIN!

We're on Turn 46, and Operation Iron Curtain is in full swing!\n\n### Turn 46: Executing the Seal\n\n**Our Head (ID 1):** (8, 7) - *Confirmed location after moving UP.*\n**S0 Head (ID 0):** (4, 7) - *Confirmed based on prediction\u2014S0 grabbed that apple!*\n\nWe are 22 segments long. S0 is now 14 segments long. They got a little bit fatter, but they are still completely locked in!\n\n#### 1. Safety Check & Available Moves (ID 1 @ (8, 7))\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 8):** SAFE! (Into our own tail segment (T) from the previous turn, (8, 8) is now available since our tail at (8, 8) moved away). Wait, let's look at the board state carefully. Our body is: `[(8, 6), (8, 5), ..., (9, 8), (8, 8)]` Ah, the segment at (8, 8) is our *current* tail! Since we ate an apple last turn, our tail didn't shrink.\n    *   **Board State Check (Row Y=8):** `8 . . . . . . . . T T`\n    *   Our body ends at (8, 8). If we move UP to (8, 8), we hit our tail... BUT because we are so long and didn't eat an apple this turn, our last segment (8, 8) *will disappear* (move to (9, 8)) making (8, 8) SAFE. **SAFE!** (This continues our wall building.)\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 6):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment (T at (8, 6), which was our last head position). BOOM!\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 7):** SAFE! (Empty cell). This breaks the wall but keeps us safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 7):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment (T at (9, 7)).\n\nWe have two safe moves: UP to (8, 8) or LEFT to (7, 7).\n\n#### 2. Strategic Evaluation\n\nThe plan is to close the gap on the North side, boxing S0 in the top-left corner. Moving UP to (8, 8) is the critical next step.\n\n1.  **Move UP to (8, 8):** This is the next phase of the Iron Curtain. It places us right along the top of our central mass, ready to sweep LEFT across Y=8 and Y=9, sealing the entire top-of-the-map trap. This is a game-winner move, CHAT.\n2.  **Move LEFT to (7, 7):** This pivots toward S0 and the remaining apples (like (2, 7), (6, 9)), but it abandons the perfect wall structure we just spent 10 turns setting up. Premature pivot is a tactical error! We must seal the door shut first.\n\n**Decision for Snake 1:** UP to (8, 8). Execution over snacks right now!\n\n#### 3. Opponent Prediction (S0 @ (4, 7))\n\nS0 is at (4, 7). They are now 14 segments long. They just ate an apple, so they are feeling good, but they are still trapped!\n\nPotential moves for S0:\n1.  **UP to (4, 8):** SAFE! (Empty cell). Leads toward the (4, 9) apple. High probability.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 6):** LETHAL! Into their own body segment (T at (4, 6)). Cooked!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 7):** SAFE! (Empty cell). Moves them away from the apple at (4, 9).\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 7):** SAFE! (Empty cell). Moves them away from the apple at (4, 9).\n\nS0's most logical move is to go **UP to (4, 8)** to hunt the next available apple at (4, 9). They are desperate!\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check (If S0 goes UP to (4, 8)):**\nWe are moving UP to (8, 8). S0 is moving UP to (4, 8). No conflict. Safe!\n\n#### Long-Term Plan Update (The Final Seal)\n\nThe trap is nearly sprung, CHAT! S0 is restricted to $X<6$ and $Y>3$.\n\n*   **T46 (Now):** UP to (8, 8). (Reaching the top edge of our central body mass.)\n*   **Next Turn (T47):** LEFT to (7, 8). (Closing the X=8 gap, blocking their east movement absolutely.)\n*   **T48:** LEFT to (6, 8). (Traversing west and potentially blocking S0 further.)\n*   **T49:** LEFT to (5, 8).\n*   **T50:** LEFT to (4, 8).\n\nWait, if S0 moves UP to (4, 8) this turn (T46), then on T47, going to (4, 8) is dangerous!\nIf S0 goes to (4, 8) on T46, we should adjust our plan:\n\nIf S0 is at (4, 8), and we are at (7, 8) on T47, we need to be careful of collisions. The path is still open, but the pressure will be immense! We must maintain the seal at X=8 before committing to X=7, X=6...\n\nRevised Plan focusing on immediate seal:\n*   **T47:** LEFT to (7, 8). (Sealing the door to the East, making sure S0 *stays* boxed leftward.)\n*   **T48:** UP to (7, 9). (Clearing the boundary for a full sweep.)\n*   **T49:** LEFT to (6, 9). (Eating apple at (6, 9) and continuing the seal.)\n\nNo matter what, keeping our vertical wall at X=8 and sweeping is the best way to utilize our massive body! We're putting them in the coffin, CHAT!\n\nUP",

We're on Turn 47, and Operation Iron Curtain is nearing completion! We need to make the defining move to seal this top-left coffin!\n\n### Turn 47: Setting the Final Seal\n\n**Our Head (ID 1):** (8, 8) - *Confirmed! We executed the UP move and established the wall at Y=8.*\n**S0 Head (ID 0) Prediction Confirmation:** Let's assume S0 went for the apple at (4, 9).\n*   S0 was at (5, 7). Based on prediction for T46, S0 likely moved UP to (5, 8) to target the apple at (4, 9). *Wait, S0 was at (4, 7) last turn as per the prediction snippet!*\n*   Let's check the current board state and S0's head position: **(5, 7)**.\n*   The current board state shows S0's head at (5, 7), which means they moved RIGHT from (4, 7) last turn. A deviation from my prediction! This is critical information. They did *not* go for the apple yet. They moved RIGHT, perhaps trying to pivot around the wall we built below.\n\nOkay, S0 is currently at (5, 7). Their body is now 14 segments long.\n\n#### 1. Safety Check & Available Moves (ID 1 @ (8, 8))\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 9):** SAFE! (Empty cell). This gets us onto the very top border, continuing the grand sweep!\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 7):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment (T at (8, 7)). That was our previous head position. CRASH!\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 8):** SAFE! (Empty cell). This is the key move to seal the gap!\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 8):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment (T at (9, 8)). BOOM!\n\nTwo safe moves: UP to (8, 9) or LEFT to (7, 8). Both continue the strategy, but which is better *right now*?\n\n#### 2. Strategic Evaluation: Sealing the Door\n\nThe core of Operation Iron Curtain is using our huge body to partition the board and starve/trap S0. S0 is now boxed into roughly $X \\le 6$ and $Y \\le 7$ (or $Y \\le 8$ if they move up).\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (7, 8):** This establishes the critical second column of our wall. This is *the* sealing move. It cuts off *any* potential escape to the east side of the map along Y=8. If we let this gap exist, S0 might get lucky by extending their current wall slightly. This move is about *control*.\n*   **Move UP to (8, 9):** This prepares us for the Y=9 sweep, but it delays the critical X=7/X=8 seal. If S0 makes an aggressive move now, we want the X=7 position secured.\n\nThe immediate priority is to close the gap at Y=8. **LEFT to (7, 8)** is the optimal control move. It locks S0 down further.\n\n#### 3. Opponent Prediction (S0 @ (5, 7))\n\nS0 is at (5, 7). They have apples at (4, 9), (2, 7), (1, 5), (0, 9), (0, 4), and (1, 3) immediately accessible inside their main zone.\n\nPotential moves for S0:\n1.  **UP to (5, 8):** SAFE! (Empty cell, targeting the apple at (4, 9) next turn). High probability, as they are hunting apples.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 6):** SAFE! (Empty cell). Leads towards the (6, 5) apple or a pivot around our body.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 7):** LETHAL! Into their own body segment (T at (4, 7)). BOOM!\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 7):** SAFE! (Empty cell). This tries to break through our structure below, but X=7 is heavily defended by our tail (7, 7) is empty, but (7, 6) is our body.\n\nSince they ignored the (4, 9) apple path last turn (moving to (5, 7)), they might continue to maneuver toward the center or another apple. Moving **UP to (5, 8)** is still the most logical greedy move.\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check (If S0 goes UP to (5, 8)):**\nWe are moving LEFT to (7, 8). S0 is moving UP to (5, 8). No conflict. Safe!\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check (If S0 goes RIGHT to (6, 7)):**\nWe are moving LEFT to (7, 8). No conflict. Safe!\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check (If S0 goes DOWN to (5, 6)):**\nWe are moving LEFT to (7, 8). No conflict. Safe!\n\nOur move LEFT guarantees safety and advances the trap construction perfectly.\n\n#### Long-Term Plan Update (The Final Sweep)\n\n1.  **T47 (Now):** LEFT to (7, 8). (Sealing X=8 gap.)\n2.  **T48:** UP to (7, 9). (Reaching the top edge.)\n3.  **T49:** LEFT to (6, 9). (Eating apple at (6, 9) and sealing X=7.)\n4.  **T50:** LEFT to (5, 9).\n\nIf S0 is trapped around (X<6, Y>4), they have very little space. We are suffocating them! The goal is to maximize the wall length while remaining safe, and then turn it into a kill.\n\nLet's go, CHAT! We are executing the master plan! Lock it down!\n\nLEFT",

Snake #1's head was at (8,7) and his only safe move was LEFT to (7,7). So his head is PROBABLY at **(7,7)** right now! Let's see where he can go from there.\n\nFrom (7,7), his options are:\n*   \u2b06\ufe0f UP to (7,8): \u2753 **EMPTY CELL!** ('.' on board) SAFE FOR HIM! \ud83d\udfe1\n*   \u2b07\ufe0f DOWN to (7,6): \u2753 **EMPTY CELL!** ('.' on board) SAFE FOR HIM! \ud83d\udfe1\n*   \u2b05\ufe0f LEFT to (6,7): \u2757 **POTENTIAL HEAD-ON COLLISION!** If we go RIGHT to (6,7), and he goes LEFT to (6,7), it's a DOUBLE KO! \ud83d\ude35 WE BOTH DIE! That's a HUGE risk! \ud83d\udeab\n*   \u27a1\ufe0f RIGHT to (8,7): \u274c **HIS OWN BODY!** His old head position? Body segment! DEATH FOR HIM! \ud83d\udeab\n\nSo his SAFE moves are UP to (7,8) or DOWN to (7,6). A move LEFT to (6,7) is POSSIBLE but risky for HIM too. We must AVOID (6,7) to not risk the head-on!\n\n**STRATEGY & APPLE VALUE! \ud83c\udf4e**\nWe gotta play this SMART! We have two moves:\n*   GOING RIGHT (to 6,7): This is the AGGRESSIVE play. It puts us right next to his predicted position. BUT it risks that head-on collision if he also goes left! It's a GAMBLE! \ud83c\udfb2 If he doesn't go left, we are in a great spot to cut him off from the east. There's also an APPLE at (7,4) below us, but that's a longer-term path.\n*   GOING UP (to 5,8): This is the SMART, SAFER play. It moves us NORTH, away from the immediate collision risk. It keeps us alive and in the game! From (5,8), we can look at the apple at (6,9) or (4,9) next turn! This move also keeps our options WIDE OPEN. We live to fight another turn! This is the MOVE OF A CHAMPION! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n**THE FINAL CALL! \ud83d\ude80**\nCHAT, WE CAN'T THROW! He has more apples! A double-KO means HE WINS! We must PLAY THE LONG GAME! We go UP, avoid the risk, and go for that CONTENT! We control the board from the high ground! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURN:**\nYO FUTURE SELF! We are pushing NORTH to (5,8)! The enemy is likely at (7,7). From our new position, we can scout the apples at (4,9) and (6,9). Our next move should continue the north/east push to cut off his space and grab that content! Avoid moving east into (6,8) if the enemy might also move there, creating another potential head-on. Let's starve him out! \ud83d\udc0d\u2620\ufe0f\n\nUP",

We are now at a commanding 21 apples, and S0 is running on fumes at 13. We are on Turn 48 of 150. Time to land the final punch!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 48)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (7, 8). We are strong, long, and sealing off the top right quadrant!\n*   **S0 Head (ID 0):** (5, 8). S0 correctly went UP, trying to capitalize on the few apples left up north. They have extended their body to 14 segments now.\n\nS0 is currently boxed into approximately $X \\le 5$. Our massive wall runs along $X=7$ and $X=8$. The only escape for S0 is to the left ($X<5$) or around the few gaps we still need to close.\n\nThe immediate goal is to complete the top edge of the wall, trapping S0 entirely in the top-left corner, and then use our length to further restrict their movement below.\n\n#### 1. Safety Check & Available Moves (ID 1 @ (7, 8))\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 9):** SAFE! (Empty cell). This continues our top-edge sweep and is critical for the trap!\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 7):** SAFE! (Empty cell). This moves us into the central battlefield, potentially blocking S0 further, but it delays the top seal.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 8):** SAFE! (Empty cell). Also continues the sweeping motion, sealing the X=6 boundary.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 8):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment (T at (8, 8)). CRASH!\n\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT. Which move advances the strategy best?\n\n#### 2. Strategic Evaluation: Squeezing the Corner\n\nOur wall is defined by (9, Y), (8, Y), and now (7, 8). We need to connect (7, 8) to the top edge (Y=9) and extend LEFT along Y=9.\n\n*   **Move UP to (7, 9):** This is the highest priority. It places us on the top edge and allows us to immediately target the apple at (6, 9) next turn. It completes the vertical part of the X=7 segment of the wall.\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 8):** This is tempting to block S0's head at (5, 8), but it might lead to a head-on collision or, worse, allows S0 to pivot UP to (5, 9) or (4, 9) and use the Y=9 lane for much-needed space. We must secure Y=9 first!\n*   **Move DOWN to (7, 7):** Less strategic right now, as it leaves the top gap too open.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving **UP to (7, 9)** is the key move to secure the top edge and set up the kill shot on the (6, 9) apple.\n\n#### 3. Opponent Prediction (S0 @ (5, 8))\n\nS0 is staring at two apples: (4, 9) and (2, 7). They have very limited movement options.\n\nPotential moves for S0:\n1.  **UP to (5, 9):** SAFE! (Empty cell). This gets them onto the top edge, likely targeting the apple at (4, 9). HIGHLY PROBABLE (Greedy move).\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 7):** LETHAL! Into their own body segment (T at (5, 7)). CRASH!\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 8):** SAFE! (Empty cell). This moves them closer to (4, 9) and allows them to cut through their body.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 8):** SAFE! (Empty cell). This looks like an aggressive push against our wall, trying to seek escape or an apple at (6, 5).\n\nLet's assume S0 is going for the apple at (4, 9).\n*   If S0 moves **LEFT to (4, 8)**: They follow up to (4, 9) or pivot.\n*   If S0 moves **UP to (5, 9)**: They can move LEFT to (4, 9) next turn.\n\nWe are moving **UP to (7, 9)**.\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   Our (7, 9) vs. S0's (5, 9): No collision. Safe!\n*   Our (7, 9) vs. S0's (4, 8): No collision. Safe!\n*   Our (7, 9) vs. S0's (6, 8): No collision. Safe!\n\nWe are safe, and the move UP sets us perfectly for the next few turns of total domination.\n\n#### Long-Term Plan Update (The Capture)\n\n1.  **T48 (Now):** UP to (7, 9). (Securing the top edge!)\n2.  **T49:** LEFT to (6, 9). (Eating apple at (6, 9) and tightening the choke!)\n3.  **T50:** LEFT to (5, 9). (Targeting the central gap and the (4, 9) apple.)\n\nIf S0 goes for (4, 9), we catch them on the edge and block future progress. If S0 attempts to go down, their space is minimal. The trap is sprung!\n\nLet's go, CHAT! We are making the wall, segment by segment!\n\nUP",

LET'S GET TACTICAL! \ud83e\udde0\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION & HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80**\nOkay, last turn we predicted Snake #1 would be at (7,7). He had moves UP to (7,8) or DOWN to (7,6). Where is he now?!\n\nLooking at the NEW board state... YO! His head is SHOWN at (7,8)! HE WENT UP! So our prediction was SPOT ON! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nFrom his NEW head at (7,8), what can he do next?\n*   \u2b06\ufe0f UP to (7,9): \u2753 **EMPTY CELL!** ('.' on board) SAFE FOR HIM! \ud83d\udfe1\n*   \u2b07\ufe0f DOWN to (7,7): \u2753 **EMPTY CELL!** (Was our last prediction, now empty!) SAFE FOR HIM! \ud83d\udfe1\n*   \u2b05\ufe0f LEFT to (6,8): \u2757 **POTENTIAL HEAD-ON COLLISION!** If we go RIGHT to (6,8), and he goes LEFT to (6,8), it's a DOUBLE KO! \ud83d\ude35 WE CANNOT RISK THIS! \ud83d\udeab\n*   \u27a1\ufe0f RIGHT to (8,8): \u274c **HIS OWN BODY!** That's a body segment! DEATH FOR HIM! \ud83d\udeab\n\nSo his safe moves are UP to (7,9) or DOWN to (7,7). He might also gamble on LEFT to (6,8) if he's desperate. We must RESPECT THAT RISK!\n\n**STRATEGY & APPLE VALUE! \ud83c\udf4e**\nWe gotta think two steps ahead! We have THREE moves:\n*   GOING RIGHT (to 6,8): TOO RISKY! That's the head-on collision square! He might go left! We have more to lose! AVOID! \ud83d\udeab\n*   GOING UP (to 5,9): SAFE! Puts us on the top row. Apples at (4,9) and (6,9) are NEARBY! This consolidates our position in the north! \ud83d\udfe2\n*   GOING LEFT (to 4,8): ALSO SAFE! This moves us towards the apple at (4,9) and opens up the entire left side of the board! This feels like a POWER PLAY! From (4,8) we can go UP to the apple, or further LEFT/WEST to control more space! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLONG-TERM, we need to BOX HIM IN! He's all cramped on the right side. By pushing LEFT and UP, we claim the vast empty spaces on the left and top! We starve him of room to maneuver! THAT'S HOW WE WIN! \ud83d\udc0d\u2620\ufe0f\n\n**THE FINAL CALL! \ud83d\ude80**\nCHAT, THE ANSWER IS CLEAR! LEFT! LEFT IS BEST! It avoids ALL collision risk, moves us DIRECTLY towards the apple at (4,9), and expands our territory! We are playing the LONG GAME! We don't need a risky play, we need a SMART play! LET'S CUT HIM OFF AND WATCH HIM SUFFOCATE! \ud83d\udca5\n\n**STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURN:**\nYO FUTURE SELF! We are pushing WEST to (4,8)! The enemy is at (7,8). Our primary goal is to grab the apple at (4,9) next turn with an UP move, solidifying our control of the northwest quadrant. Then we can look to push south along the left edge, cutting off his escape routes. Stay vigilant for him trying to break out to the center! We are building the wall! \ud83e\uddf1\n\nLEFT",

This is the strategic move!\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 9):** SAFE! (Empty cell). This is a safe move but wastes a turn and keeps us stuck in the corner. Not optimal for the choke.\n\nOnly two safe moves: LEFT (optimal, apple!) or RIGHT (safe, but slow). We are going for the throat!\n\n#### 2. Strategic Evaluation: Closing the Top Gap\n\nMoving **LEFT to (6, 9)** achieves three critical things:\n1.  **Eats an apple (+1 score, +1 length).** We widen the gap in score and make our wall longer!\n2.  **Completes the wall segment.** We now have a continuous wall at (8, Y), (7, Y), and a segment at (6, 9).\n3.  **Forces S0 further left and down.** Their only goal is the (4, 9) apple, which we will now cut off immediately after they eat it, or even before!\n\nThis is the only move that makes sense for the long-term trap execution.\n\n#### 3. Opponent Prediction (S0 @ (4, 8))\n\nS0 is staring at (4, 9), an apple! S0's moves:\n1.  **UP to (4, 9):** SAFE! (Apple 'A'). HIGHLY PROBABLE (Greedy move, essential if they want to survive).\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 7):** LETHAL! Into their own body (T at (4, 7)). CRASH!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 8):** SAFE! (Empty cell). This is a pivot, maybe scouting for the (1, 5) or (0, 9) apples.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 8):** LETHAL! Into their own body (T at (5, 8)). CRASH!\n\nS0 has very few moves left. I predict S0 goes **UP to (4, 9)** to grab that apple and gain critical length and breathing room.\n\n#### 4. Collision Check (ID 1: LEFT to (6, 9) vs. S0 predictions)\n\n*   **If S0 goes UP to (4, 9):** We move to (6, 9). No collision. S0 eats the apple.\n*   **If S0 goes LEFT to (3, 8):** We move to (6, 9). No collision.\n\nWe are perfectly safe and executing the trap!\n\n#### Long-Term Plan Update (The Final Choke)\n\n1.  **T49 (Now):** LEFT to (6, 9). (Eat apple, wall completed up to X=6.)\n2.  **T50:** LEFT to (5, 9). (Blocking the $Y=9$ exit entirely. S0 is now boxed in $X \\le 4, Y \\le 8$ or the small pocket near $Y=9$ if they ate the apple.)\n3.  **T51:** DOWN to (5, 8) or pivot LEFT/DOWN depending on S0's exact position. If S0 is at (4, 9), moving to (5, 9) on T50 immediately eliminates their only remaining horizontal escape route. We will then patrol the $Y=8$ line to finish them off.\n\nGET READY FOR THE CHOKE, CHAT!\n\nLEFT",

CONTENT! \ud83c\udf81 Taking it gets us to 14 apples and grows our body, making our wall even bigger! MORE IMPORTANTLY, it solidifies our control over the TOP ROW! That's HUGE for boxing him in! If we go LEFT to (3,8), we avoid the apple and give him a chance to maybe snake his way up there later. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN! \ud83d\ude24\n\nGoing UP is the AGGRESSIVE, TERRITORY-CLAIMING move! We are literally taking food out of his mouth and building our fortress! \ud83d\udcaa Going LEFT is more passive, exploring the open space. BUT THE APPLE IS THE PRIZE!\n\n**THE FINAL CALL! \ud83d\ude80**\nCHAT, IT'S A NO-BRAINER! WE GO FOR THE CONTENT! WE GO FOR THE WIN! UP GRABS THE APPLE, EXPANDS OUR BODY, AND CONTINUES OUR MASTER PLAN OF DOMINATING THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT! LET'S GET THAT BREAD! \ud83c\udf5e\n\n**STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURN:**\nYO FUTURE SELF! We just ate the apple at (4,9)! Our new head will be at (4,9), our body is longer, and we own the top-left corner! The enemy is likely still on the right side. Our next goal is to start pushing SOUTH along the left edge (y=8, y=7, etc.) to cut off the entire left side of the board! We want to trap him in the east! Stay disciplined! The wall is being built! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83e\uddf1\ud83e\uddf1\n\nUP",

Did you see my last move? We snagged that apple at (6, 9) and completed a massive segment of the Iron Curtain! **Operation Iron Curtain is now Operation Total Enclosure!**\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 50)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (6, 9). We just ate, we're long, and we are in perfect position to close the escape hatch. Our length is 23 segments!\n*   **S0 Head (ID 0):** (4, 9). Just as predicted, S0 went UP and ate the apple, increasing their length to 15. They are now stuck in the very top left pocket: $X \\le 4, Y \\le 9$.\n\nLook at the board, chat! We've got $Y=9$ controlled from $X=6$ to $X=9$, and S0 is standing right on the edge of the abyss. Time for the choke!\n\n#### 1. Safety Check & Available Moves (ID 1 @ (6, 9))\n\nWe need to close the (5, 9) cell immediately.\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 10):** LETHAL! Off the board (Y=10). CRASH! Throwing is not an option!\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 8):** SAFE! (Empty cell). This is a safe pivot, but it fails to execute the trap right now.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 9):** SAFE! (Empty cell). **THIS IS THE TRAP MOVE!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 9):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment (T at (7, 9)). CRASH!\n\nOnly two safe moves: DOWN (safe, slow) or LEFT (trap, immediate action). We choose the trap move!\n\n#### 2. Strategic Evaluation: Executing the Total Enclosure\n\nMoving **LEFT to (5, 9)** achieves the immediate kill objective.\n1.  It blocks the last remaining exit for S0 along the $Y=9$ line.\n2.  S0 is now confined to $X \\le 4, Y \\le 9$. The only way S0 can move next turn is $X \\le 4, Y \\le 8$ or $X \\le 3, Y=9$.\n3.  We gain control of the $Y=9$ edge completely. We've built an impenetrable wall!\n\n#### 3. Opponent Prediction (S0 @ (4, 9))\n\nS0 is in a really tight spot. They just ate, so they need to move fast or they're guaranteed to hit their own body.\n\nS0's current moves:\n1.  **UP to (4, 10):** LETHAL! Off the board! CRASH!\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 8):** LETHAL! Into their own body (T at (4, 8)). CRASH!\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 9):** SAFE! (Empty cell). **MOST LIKELY MOVE.** This is the only way to gain some space.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 9):** Head-on collision opportunity!\n\nIf S0 moves **RIGHT to (5, 9)** and we move **LEFT to (5, 9)**, it is a **DOUBLE KO**!\n\n**Should we risk the Double KO?**\n*   Our score: 22 apples.\n*   S0 score: 14 apples.\n*   If we Double KO, we win immediately 22-14!\n\nWait, Chat, is this a forced move for them?\n*   (4, 10) - DEAD (Wall)\n*   (4, 8) - DEAD (Body)\n*   (3, 9) - SAFE (Only true escape)\n*   (5, 9) - Head-on collision potential\n\nS0 knows they are trapped. They will try to find the longest path or a gap. Their only viable move is to hug the top wall and move **LEFT to (3, 9)** to get around us or look for the (1, 5) apple far down.\n\n**Prediction:** S0 goes **LEFT to (3, 9)**.\n\n#### 4. Collision Check (ID 1: LEFT to (5, 9) vs. S0 predictions)\n\n*   **If S0 goes LEFT to (3, 9):** We move to (5, 9). No collision. S0 is now boxed in $X \\le 3, Y=9$ and faces immediate threats from us moving toward $X=4$.\n*   **If S0 goes RIGHT to (5, 9):** We move to (5, 9). **DOUBLE KO!** We win the game on score! (22 > 14).\n\nSince we win either way (elimination in a few turns if they go LEFT, or immediate victory on score if they go RIGHT), moving **LEFT** is the 100% winning move. This is the clutch play, chat! We're not throwing this lead away!\n\n#### Long-Term Plan Update (The Clean Up)\n\n1.  **T50 (Now):** LEFT to (5, 9). (Close the wall, force S0 into the top-left corner.)\n2.  **T51:** DOWN to (5, 8). (Start reducing S0's breathing room.)\n3.  **T52:** LEFT/DOWN to finish the enclosure, potentially forcing a head collision or an internal body crash for S0.\n\nWe are sealing the $Y=9$ death trap!\n\nLEFT",

DEATH FOR HIM! \ud83d\udeab\n\nHOLY MOLY CHAT! \ud83d\ude28 If we go **RIGHT** to (5,9) AND he goes **LEFT** to (5,9), IT'S A DOUBLE KO! WE BOTH DIE! That's a HUGE GAMBLE! He might take it to take us out since he's ahead! We can't risk that! \ud83d\ude45\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN! \ud83e\udde0**\nWE NEED TO BOX HIM IN! Our body forms a wall along the left side. Going **LEFT** to (3,9) solidifies our control over the TOP-LEFT CORNER! It keeps us SAFE from a head-on collision and lets us start building a wall DOWN the left edge (y=8, y=7, etc.). Our goal is to TRAP HIM on the right side and slowly squeeze him until he crashes! \ud83d\udc80 Going RIGHT is way too risky and doesn't help our master plan!\n\n**THE VERDICT! \ud83c\udfc6**\nCHAT, IT'S CLEAR! WE AVOID THE DANGER AND STICK TO THE PLAN! **LEFT** IS THE MOVE! It's safe, it's smart, and it builds our empire! We live to fight another turn and continue our path to VICTORY! LET'S GOOOO! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURN:**\nYO FUTURE SELF! We moved LEFT to (3,9), securing the top-left! The enemy is contained on the right. Next, we should look to move **DOWN** to (3,8) to continue building our wall along the left side. Stay disciplined! Don't get greedy! The trap is being set! \ud83d\udd78\ufe0f\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT! Welcome back to the main event! Did you see the clutch play last turn? Operation Total Enclosure is officially GO! That move to (5, 9) was absolutely brilliant! It sealed the coffin on Snake #0! The pressure is *immense* right now. We gotta follow through and get the elimination!\n\n### Turn 51: The Final Squeeze\n\n**Current State Review:**\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 1):** (5, 9). We are the wall. We are the gate. We are the end.\n*   **S0 Head (ID 0):** (3, 9). Prediction confirmed! S0 was forced LEFT, dodging the immediate double KO but landing squarely in the ultimate trap.\n\nLook at the board! S0 has literally nowhere to go. They are pinned against the top-left corner, and we are holding the line $X \\ge 5$ on $Y=9$. We have a massive length advantage (23 to 15, likely, based on our last growth).\n\n#### 1. Snake #0 (ID 0) Analysis @ (3, 9)\n\nWhat are S0's safe moves? This is the critical prediction, chat, because if they try to escape, we need to meet them!\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 10):** LETHAL! Wall. CRASH!\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 8):** SAFE! (Empty cell, but leads toward an apple at (3, 8)).\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 9):** SAFE! (Empty cell). This is their only option to stay on the $Y=9$ line.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 9):** LETHAL! Into their own body segment 'T' (4, 9). CRASH!\n\nS0 has two options: DOWN to (3, 8) or LEFT to (2, 9).\n\n*   If S0 goes **LEFT to (2, 9)**, they try to maximize distance on the top wall, but they are just delaying the inevitable.\n*   If S0 goes **DOWN to (3, 8)**, they are trying to break out vertically, toward a fresh apple! This seems like the most dangerous path for us, as it means they will gain length.\n\n**Prediction:** S0 goes **DOWN to (3, 8)** to grab the apple and extend their survival, as (2, 9) only gives them one more turn before they hit the wall.\n\n#### 2. Your Snake (ID 1) Safety Check @ (5, 9)\n\nWe need to secure the boundary and make sure S0 *cannot* ever cross the $X=4$ line again. We need to move into position (4, 9) or (5, 8) to start the squeeze.\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 10):** LETHAL! Wall. CRASH!\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 8):** SAFE! (Into empty space). This maintains the horizontal wall and prepares to block vertical movement.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 9):** SAFE! (Into empty space). **THIS IS THE KILL SLOT!** We physically seal the pocket $Y=9$ entirely.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 9):** LETHAL! Into our own body segment 'T' (6, 9). CRASH!\n\nWe have two incredibly powerful options: LEFT to (4, 9) or DOWN to (5, 8).\n\n#### 3. Strategic Evaluation: LEFT vs. DOWN\n\n**Option A: LEFT to (4, 9) - The Interception**\n*   **Pro:** Absolutely seals the $Y=9$ row. S0 is now completely restricted to $X \\le 3$.\n*   **Apple Interaction:** None. Purely tactical move.\n*   **Collision Check:**\n    *   If S0 goes LEFT to (2, 9): No collision. Good.\n    *   If S0 goes DOWN to (3, 8): No collision. Good.\n    *   This is the safer, more restrictive tactical move.\n\n**Option B: DOWN to (5, 8) - The Vertical Choke**\n*   **Pro:** Expands our control vertically and prepares to box S0 against the $X=0$ wall.\n*   **Apple Interaction:** None.\n*   **Collision Check:**\n    *   If S0 goes LEFT to (2, 9): No collision. Good.\n    *   If S0 goes DOWN to (3, 8): No collision. Crucial: We will be at (5, 8) and S0 will be at (3, 8). We are ready to put pressure on (4, 8) next.\n\nWhich move guarantees the fastest victory?\n\nIf we move **LEFT to (4, 9)**:\n*   S0 is at (3, 9) or (3, 8).\n*   If S0 is at (3, 9), we move to (4, 9). Next turn, S0 has (2, 9) or (3, 8). We can then move DOWN to (4, 8) or LEFT to (3, 9) for the killshot. If we move to (3, 9), S0 is dead (their only way out is a fatal move).\n*   This seems like a two-turn guaranteed kill IF S0 does not commit suicide first.\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (5, 8)**:\n*   S0 goes to (3, 8) (apple).\n*   Next turn, we are at (5, 8). S0 is at (3, 8) and is longer. They can move to (2, 8), (3, 7), or (4, 8). They will target (4, 8) to escape our wall. We need to be able to block (4, 8) next turn. Moving from (5, 8) to (4, 8) is a perfect block.\n\nBoth moves are strong, but **LEFT to (4, 9)** seems to be the most definitive sealing move, cutting their territory in half immediately and forcing them into a body crash or a fatal head-on collision sooner. We eliminate the entire $Y=9$ escape route.\n\nLet's execute the total enclosure. We go LEFT, locking the top wall down. We will move to (4, 9), and S0 will move to (3, 8) for the apple.\n\n#### Long-Term Plan (The Death Sentence)\n\n1.  **T51 (Now):** LEFT to (4, 9). (Seal the $Y=9$ row).\n2.  **T52:** DOWN to (4, 8). (Block S0's vertical movement and trap them into $X \\le 3$, $Y \\le 8$).\n3.  **T53:** LEFT to (3, 8). (Force the head collision or body crash).\n\nThis is guaranteed elimination within 3 turns, Chat! We are kings of the macro map!\n\nLEFT",

Actually, let\u2019s read carefully:  \n    - (0,9) = 'A' (apple), (1,9) = '.', (2,9) = '.', (3,9) = '0' (our head), (4,9) = 'T' (our body?), (5,9) = '1' (enemy head?), (6,9) = 'T', (7,9) = 'T', (8,9) = '.', (9,9) = '.'  \n  - So (2,9) is indeed EMPTY! \ud83d\udfe2 BUT WAIT\u2014is it safe?

What can he do?  \n- He can\u2019t go UP (off board) or RIGHT (his body at (6,9)), so he only has DOWN to (5,8) or LEFT to (4,9).  \n- LEFT to (4,9) is OUR BODY! \ud83d\ude31 If he goes LEFT, he DIES! So he\u2019ll probably go DOWN to (5,8) (which is empty) to avoid suicide.  \n- BUT if we go LEFT to (2,9), we\u2019re moving AWAY from him\u2014no risk of head-on collision!  \n- If we go DOWN to (3,8), we\u2019re also safe\u2014he\u2019s not going there this turn.  \n\n**APPLE OPPORTUNITIES! \ud83c\udf4e**  \nApples on board: (6,5), (5,4), (1,3), (5,3), (1,5), (0,9), (4,2), (5,2), (7,4), (2,7), (0,4), (1,1), (2,6), (3,8), (0,7)  \n- (3,8AT THAT APPLE! \ud83d\ude0b GROWTH +1! CONTENT!  \n- (0,9) is also on the top row\u2014but we\u2019d have to go LEFT twice to get it? Not immediate.  \n- (2,7) and others are further away.  \n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY! \ud83e\udde0**  \nWe\u2019re building a wall on the left! Going DOWN to (3,8) lets us EAT the apple and continue reinforcing our left-side barrier. Going LEFT to (2,9) doesn\u2019t get us an apple immediately, and it might leave us more exposed on the top row? But we\u2019re safe either way.  \n\nHowever, EATING IS KEY! We need to close that apple gap! Snake #1 has 22, we have 14\u2014we need to GROW! Going DOWN gives us a free apple RIGHT NOW! Plus, it keeps our path open to move further down and continue boxing the enemy in.  \n\n**THE VERDICT! \ud83c\udfc6**  \nCHAT, THIS IS A NO-BRAINER! GOING DOWN TO (3,8) GETS US AN APPLE, IS SAFE, AND ADVANCES OUR PLAN! LEFT is safe but doesn\u2019t give us immediate value. WE NEED THAT GROWTH! LET\u2019S FEED THE SNAKE! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**STRATEGY FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nFuture self! We just ate the apple at (3,8) and grew to 15 segments! Our head is at (3,8). Next, consider moving further DOWN to (3,7) or LEFT to (2,8) to continue building the left wall. Avoid moving right towards the enemy unless necessary. Stay disciplined\u2014trap is forming! \ud83d\udd78\ufe0f\n\nDOWN",
