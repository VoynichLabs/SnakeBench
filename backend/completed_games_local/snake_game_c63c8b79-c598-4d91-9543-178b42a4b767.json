          "rationale": "YO, what is UP, chat?! Welcome back! We're dive-bombing right into a fresh turn, zero apples for either of us, and the tension is THICK! We're like two fighters staring each other down in the center of the ring! \ud83e\udd4a\n\nOur archrival, Snake #0, is sitting at (6, 4). We are at (7, 3). We are diagonally separated by just one crucial square: (6, 3) or (7, 4). They are RIGHT THERE!\n\nWe need to establish positional dominance early and, more importantly, GET THAT FIRST APPLE! First blood, first content, first win condition!\n\nLet's break down the board and our options.\n\n**Our Position:** (7, 3)\n**Rival Position (Snake #0):** (6, 4)\n\n**Nearest Apples:**\n1. (8, 2) - One move South-East, easy reach.\n2. (9, 3) - One move East, easy reach.\n3. (7, 5) - Two moves North, potentially contested.\n4. (6, 1) - Three moves South-West.\n\n**Safety Check (Turn 0, we have no body, so only boundaries and rival heads matter):**\n\n| Direction | New Position | Rival's Potential Moves & Collision Risk | Safe? | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **UP** | (7, 4) | 0 could move DOWN to (6, 3), LEFT to (5, 4), or RIGHT to (7, 4). **HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK!** | NO | If 0 moves RIGHT, we die simultaneously. We don't want a draw yet! |\n| **DOWN** | (7, 2) | 0 can't directly impact this area. | YES | Moves toward apple at (8, 2) and (9, 2). |\n| **LEFT** | (6, 3) | 0 could move DOWN to (6, 3). **HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK!** | NO | If 0 moves DOWN, we die simultaneously. |\n| **RIGHT**| (8, 3) | 0 can't directly impact this area. | YES | Moves toward apple at (9, 3) and (8, 2). |\n\nWOW. Moving UP or LEFT is a 50/50 KO risk based on the opponent's move. We are NOT taking that risk this early, chat! We need definitive moves.\n\n**Available Safe Moves:** DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves:**\n\n1. **Move RIGHT to (8, 3):**\n    * Gets us adjacent to apple at (9, 3). We could move RIGHT next turn to eat.\n    * Gets us adjacent to apple at (8, 2). We could move DOWN next turn to eat.\n    * Keeps us relatively close to the rival but forces them away from the immediate clash zone if they want an apple.\n    * **Rival's likely move:** 0 sees the apple at (7, 5) or tries to move south towards (6, 1) or stay central. If 0 moves UP to (6, 5) or RIGHT to (7, 4) (risking collision with $1$ if $1$ moved $UP$), they secure better northern positioning. If they move LEFT to (5, 4), they are isolated.\n\n2. **Move DOWN to (7, 2):**\n    * Gets us adjacent to apple at (8, 2). We could move RIGHT next turn to eat.\n    * Gets us adjacent to apple at (9, 2). We could move RIGHT, then RIGHT/DOWN.\n    * This move puts significant distance between us and Snake #0 immediately, focusing purely on getting points.\n\n**Strategic Analysis (What do we want? Points or Position?):**\n\nWe are perfectly positioned to grab apples in the 8/9 column. Snake #0 is centralized but their closest easy apple is (7, 5) which is two moves away (e.g., UP twice). (6, 1) is three moves away (DOWN, DOWN, LEFT).\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (8, 3):\n* Next turn (T=1), we can move RIGHT to (9, 3) and grab an apple! (Assuming 0 doesn't steal it, which is unlikely as they are far away).\n* If we move RIGHT, 0 might move UP to (6, 5) or LEFT to (5, 4). They will likely aim for (7, 5).\n\nIf we move DOWN to (7, 2):\n* Next turn (T=1), we can move RIGHT to (8, 2) and grab an apple!\n* Or we could move DOWN to (7, 1) and then LEFT to (6, 1) if 0 is ignoring it.\n* Moving DOWN isolates us from 0's immediate threat, which is safe, but delays our first apple by one extra turn compared to the RIGHT-RIGHT path if 0 competes for (8, 2).\n\nWait, let's look at the apple density.\nThe RIGHT side (columns 7-9) is loaded: (9, 3), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 7).\nMoving **RIGHT** to (8, 3) lines us up for the guaranteed apple at (9, 3) next turn, which is one move further away from 0's likely path (UP towards 7, 5).\n\nLet's secure the points, chat! We establish the lead, then we circle back for the trap!\n\n**Plan:** Move RIGHT to (8, 3). Next turn, move RIGHT to (9, 3) and score!\n\nThis keeps us safe from the immediate KO threat and guarantees us an apple on Turn 1 if nobody interferes, which is unlikely given 0's position.\n\nLet's make that move! Secure the bag! \ud83d\udcb0\n\nRIGHT",

Nah, we're boxing him into oblivion\u2014plan's to loop around, snag apples while he starves, and force a crash. Who's ready for the W? Let's break this down FAST!\n\nFirst, board check: I'm at (6,4), solo head, wide open. Rival's chillin' at (7,3), no body either. Apples everywhere, but closest for me? (7,5) at dist 2\u2014juicy target! (6,1) at 3, (7,6) at 3. He's eyeing (7,5) too, probably. Sneaky fool might slither up to (7,4), so no suicidal right move from me\u2014boom, head-on KO! \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udca5\n\nOptions: UP to (6,5)\u2014safe, empty, cuts dist to (7,5) to 1, options wide open for right next. Keeps me flexible, away from his likely path. DOWN to (6,3)? Tempting for (6,1) apple, but if he lefts into it? Risky dice roll. LEFT to (5,4)\u2014boring safe, but drifts me from prime apples. RIGHT? Suicide if he ups\u2014pass!\n\nSafe picks: All but we smart ones prioritize apple chase + open space. UP maximizes survival AND content\u2014grow quick, then circle back to trap him in a corner. He's gonna eat dust! \ud83c\udfc6 Who's hyped? \n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**  \nShort-term strat: Turn 1 UP to (6,5), eye (7,5) apple next turn. If rival contests, pivot down to (6,1) for safe grow. Long-term: Herd him right/east towards walls, snag left apples, grow longer to block his escapes. Box and starve, turn 5-10.  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

We're sitting pretty at (8, 3), and Snake #0 is now chilling at (6, 5), having moved North towards the (7, 5) apple! Clever, but they didn't beat us to the punch!\n\nTurn 1. We are *this close* to first blood! The plan was to move RIGHT again to (9, 3) and secure the bag! Let's confirm that's still the optimal, safe, and dominating move!\n\n**Our Position:** (8, 3). No body yet.\n**Rival Position (Snake #0):** (6, 5). No body yet.\n\n**Nearest Apple Targets:**\n1. (9, 3) - RIGHT move from us. Instant apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. (8, 2) - DOWN move from us.\n3. (7, 5) - Where 0 just moved towards.\n\n**Safety Check (We are short, only boundaries and rival head matter):**\n\n**Our Available Moves from (8, 3):**\n\n| Direction | New Position | Rival's Potential Moves & Collision Risk | Safe? | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **UP** | (8, 4) | 0 is at (6, 5). 0 could move R to (7, 5), U to (6, 6), L to (5, 5), D to (6, 4).

We love it when the path is clear! \ud83d\udee3\ufe0f\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves for Goals (Apples & Position):**\n\n1. **Move RIGHT to (9, 3):**\n    * **Impact:** EAT APPLE! Score 1. Grow to length 2.\n    * **Position:** We establish dominance on the right edge. 0 is centralized, but we have the point lead. Our body will leave a segment at (8, 3).\n    * **Future:** We are now positioned to chase (9, 7) or (9, 2).\n\n2. **Move DOWN to (8, 2):**\n    * **Impact:** EAT APPLE! Score 1. Grow to length 2.\n    * **Position:** Similar to RIGHT, but slightly further down the board. Our body will leave a segment at (8, 3).\n\n**Which apple is better? (9, 3) or (8, 2)?**\n\nBoth guarantee a score of 1 and growth. Let's look at 0's likely move.\nSnake #0 is at (6, 5). Their most obvious target is (7, 5).\nIf $0$ moves RIGHT to (7, 5), they eat the apple, score 1, and grow. TIE SCORE.\nIf $0$ moves UP to (6, 6) or LEFT to (5, 5), they miss their closest apple.\nIf $0$ moves DOWN to (6, 4), they are playing defensively.\n\nWe must assume 0 goes for the apple at (7, 5). This means 0 moves RIGHT.\n\nIf 0 moves RIGHT to (7, 5) (EAT), and we move RIGHT to (9, 3) (EAT):\n* T=2 Positions: We are at (9, 3) with body at (8, 3). 0 is at (7, 5) with body at (6, 5).\n* We are separated by a good distance, both scoring. This is a very predictable but strong start.\n\nIf 0 moves RIGHT to (7, 5) (EAT), and we move DOWN to (8, 2) (EAT):\n* T=2 Positions: We are at (8, 2) with body at (8, 3). 0 is at (7, 5) with body at (6, 5).\n* This configuration puts us slightly closer to 0's path if 0 decides to move SOUTH from (7, 5). (Our head at 8, 2; 0 can move to 7, 4 or 8, 5 / 7, 6).\n\nThe (9, 3) apple is deeper into our corner, establishing a better perimeter line. It pulls us further away from 0 and keeps us in a strong scoring region (9, 7) and (9, 2) are nearby. The (8, 2) apple pulls us slightly more central (though still safe).\n\n**CONCLUSION:** Sticking to the plan! Move RIGHT, secure the (9, 3) apple, and establish a point lead or at least match 0's score while dictating position on the right flank. This move maximizes safety and score based on the current board state.\n\nLet's get this $W$, chat! Drop those $W$s in the chat!\n\nRIGHT",

(7,6) up-right at 2, (6,1) down at 4. Rival's too far to contest my spots this turn; from (8,3), he might snag (8,2) down or (9,3) right, but if he lefts to (7,3)? Still no threat to me. No head-ons possible\u2014board's wide open, no suicides in sight. We're growin' FAST before he even blinks!\n\nDirex options, straight fire:\n- UP to (6,6): Safe AF, empty cell, edges me toward (7,6) apple (dist now 1). Keeps paths open north, but delays my immediate feast. Solid flex, but why wait?\n- DOWN to (6,4): Empty, safe\u2014heads south to (6,1) apple (dist 3). Options stay decent, but pulls me from the prime east apples. Meh for now.\n- LEFT to (5,5): Empty, chill move west\u2014opens left flank, closer to (5,0) apple (dist 5). Boring tho, drifts from rival pressure and easy picks. Pass!\n- RIGHT to (7,5): BOOM! Straight to the APPLE, safe as houses\u2014no board edge, no bodies, rival can't collide (he's blocks away). Eat +1, grow to length 2 IMMEDIATELY. Future moves? Wide open east/north from there, herdin' him into walls. This is the alpha play\u2014grow quick, block his vibes!\n\nAll safe, but RIGHT screams \"WIN NOW\"\u2014max apple chase, zero collision risk, keeps me central with escape routes galore. We're not playin' defense; offense is the vibe to box him early! If he chases east, we pivot north and starve his ass. \ud83d\udc80 Who's feelin' this glow-up? CHAT, WE EATING!\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**  \nShort-term strat: RIGHT to (7,5) for instant apple\u2014grow to 2, then UP to (7,6) next if open, or LEFT back to block rival paths. Dodge any dumb rival lunge east. Long-term: Circle clockwise east/north, snag (9,7)/(7,6)/(9,3) chain\u2014grow to 5+ by turn 5, extend body to wall off his south/east escapes. Force him into (8-9,x) dead zone, crash him turn 8-12. Dominate the board!  \n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

We have a border at x=9 and all y-values.\n\n| Direction | New Position | Death Condition? | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **UP** | (9, 4) | Wall? No. Body? No (8, 3). 0? No (7, 5). | SAFE |\n| **DOWN** | (9, 2) | Wall? No. Body? No. 0? No. | SAFE (APPLE!) |\n| **LEFT** | (8, 3) | **INTO OWN BODY!** | DEAD |\n| **RIGHT**| (10, 3) | **OFF BOARD!** | DEAD |\n\nWe immediately eliminate LEFT and RIGHT. We only have UP and DOWN as safe moves! What a tight spot! Chat, only two possibilities!\n\n### 2. Evaluating Safe Moves (UP vs DOWN)\n\nNow we consider 0's likely move. 0 is at (7, 5), and the apple at (7, 6) is their prime target. We must assume $0$ moves UP to (7, 6).\n\n**Scenario A: We move DOWN to (9, 2) (EAT APPLE)**\n\n*   **Our State:** Head at (9, 2), body [(9, 3), (8, 3)]. Length 3. Score 2.\n*   **0's Likely State:** Head at (7, 6), body [(7, 5), (6, 5)]. Length 3. Score 2.\n*   **Collision Check:** Are (9, 2) and (7, 6) the same? No. Is (9, 2) on 0's body? No. Is (7, 6) on ours? No.\n*   **Impact:** We score, 0 scores. We keep the lead on the right edge. We are now in a great spot to chase (8, 2) (if still there) or (9, 7).\n*   **Future:** (9, 2) is a good location, very far from 0.\n\n**Scenario B: We move UP to (9, 4) (NO APPLE)**\n\n*   **Our State:** Head at (9, 4), body [(9, 3), (8, 3)]. Length 2 (no growth). Score 1.\n*   **0's Likely State:** Head at (7, 6), body [(7, 5), (6, 5)]. Length 3. Score 2.\n*   **Impact:** 0 takes the lead 2-1 and grows longer. This is bad positioning. We let 0 get stronger while we stagnate.\n*   **Future:** We are still good for (9, 7) but we missed a free score.\n\n**Wait, let's re-examine (8, 2)!** The apple at (8, 2) is now 1 step away from our tail at (8, 3).\n\nIf we move DOWN to (9, 2) (EAT):\n*   Head (9, 2). New Body [(9, 3), (8, 3)]. Tail (8, 3).\n*   The (8, 2) apple is now 1 move LEFT from our new tail (8, 3). It takes us two moves minimum to get that apple (e.g., L to (8, 2) next turn, but that's into our body *if* we still had an old body). Since we grow, our body segments move.\n\nWait, the apple at **(8, 2)** is visible on the board.\nIf we move DOWN to (9, 2) (Eat):\n*   We increase our length and score. This is a guaranteed 1 point.\n*   Our follow up: We could move LEFT to (8, 2) next turn, grabbing another apple! This would be a 2-turn, 2-apple play. (9, 2) --> (8, 2). *We must ensure (9, 3) is not Snake 0's body.* Snake 0 will be at (7, 6) and (7, 5), (6, 5). Safe.\n\nIf 0 moves UP to (7, 6), and we move DOWN to (9, 2), we secure the guaranteed score, maintain parity, and position ourselves beautifully for the apple at (8, 2) on T=3.\n\nThis is a no-brainer, chat! We take the guaranteed points and set up a combo play for next turn! Let's build this lead!\n\n**Strategy Note for T=3:** If we successfully grab (9, 2) this turn, our head is at (9, 2) and our body is at [(9, 3), (8, 3)]. Next turn, we should move LEFT to (8, 2) to grab the third apple, provided $0$ does not block or intercept.\n\nDOWN",

We're still tied in score, but we've got the superior positioning. We took down a guaranteed apple and set ourselves up for ANOTHER one! Let's get this $2$ apple combo!\n\n### State Update - Turn 3\n\n**OUR DETAILS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 2)\n*   Body: [(9, 3), (8, 3)]\n*   Length: 3\n\n**RIVAL DETAILS (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (7, 6)\n*   Body: [(7, 5), (6, 5)]\n*   Length: 3\n\n**Apple Targets:**\nWe are laser-focused on the apple at **(8, 2)**. It's one step LEFT!\n\n**Rival's Focus (Hypothesis):**\nSnake #0 is at (7, 6).\n*   Closest target: (8, 8) or (9, 7). (8, 8) is 2 steps away (R, U). (9, 7) is 3 steps away (R, U, U).\n*   The apple at (7, 7) from the board map isn't an apple in the log, but there IS an apple at (9, 7).\n*   (8, 4) is 3 steps away (D, L, L).\n*   Snake #0 might move RIGHT to (8, 6) to scope out the center or UP to (7, 7) or DOWN to (7, 5) (suicide).\n\nLet's assume Snake #0 moves **RIGHT** to (8, 6) for better visibility or UP to (7, 7) (which is empty).\n\n### 1. Safety Check (Eliminating Deadly Moves)\n\nOur previous body segment is at (9, 3). Our tail is at (8, 3). Our head is (9, 2).\nWe are looking at moving from (9, 2).\n\n| Direction | New Position | Death Condition? | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **UP** | (9, 3) | **INTO OWN BODY!** | DEAD |\n| **DOWN** | (9, 1) | Wall? No. Body? No. 0? No. | SAFE |\n| **LEFT** | (8, 2) | Wall? No. Body? No. 0? No. | SAFE (APPLE!) |\n| **RIGHT**| (10, 2) | **OFF BOARD!** | DEAD |\n\nWell, Chat, that simplifies things! We immediately eliminate UP (suicide!) and RIGHT (off-board!).\n\nWe are left with DOWN or LEFT (Apple!).\n\n### 2. Evaluating Safe Moves (DOWN vs LEFT)\n\n#### Option A: Move LEFT to (8, 2) (EAT APPLE)\n\n*   **Our State:** Head at (8, 2), body [(9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3)]. Length 4. Score 3.\n*   **0's Likely State (Scenario 1: RIGHT to 8, 6):** Head at (8, 6), body (7, 6). Length 4. Score 3.\n    *   Collision Check: (8, 2) vs (8, 6). No collision.\n*   **0's Likely State (Scenario 2: UP to 7, 7):** Head at (7, 7), body (7, 6). Length 3. Score 2. (No Apple at 7, 7).\n    *   Collision Check: (8, 2) vs (7, 7). No collision.\n\n**Impact of LEFT:** We guarantee a second apple, increasing our length to 4. We are now extremely long and starting to dominate the lower right quadrant. This is exactly what we planned for!\n\n#### Option B: Move DOWN to (9, 1) (NO APPLE)\n\n*   **Our State:** Head at (9, 1), body [(9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3)]. Length 3 (no growth). Score 2.\n*   **Impact of DOWN:** We miss the guaranteed apple at (8, 2). While it keeps us safe on the far right perimeter, it gives Snake #0 time to potentially intercept (8, 2) if they move awkwardly, or catch up in score and length. We lose momentum. This is a defensive, non-scoring move when a score is open.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe move LEFT to (8, 2) is a guaranteed score, executes our pre-planned \"2-apple combo,\" and significantly increases our length advantage over the central Snake #0.

Our length is now 4, and the rival's Snake #0 only has a length of 3! We are dominating this quadrant! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcc8\n\nLet's look at the new board state. This is getting spicy!\n\n### State Update - Turn 4\n\n**OUR DETAILS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (8, 2)\n*   Body: [(9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3)]\n*   Length: 4. Score: 3.\n\n**RIVAL DETAILS (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (8, 6) (Looks like they moved RIGHT, just as we hypothesized!)\n*   Body: [(7, 6), (7, 5)]\n*   Length: 3. Score: 2.\n\n**Apple Targets:**\nLook at our position at (8, 2)! We have apples nearby:\n1.  (8, 4) - 2 steps (U, U) or (U, L, U)\n2.  (9, 7) - 6 steps (L, U, U, U)\n3.  (6, 1) - 3 steps (L, D, L)\n\nThe rivals are at (8, 6). Their closest targets are:\n1.  (9, 7) - 2 steps (R, U)\n2.  (8, 8) - 2 steps (U, U)\n3.  (2, 8) - 6 steps (L, L, L, L, U, U)\n\nSnake #0 is perfectly positioned to grab (9, 7) or (8, 8). We need to move away from that area and secure the lower quadrant before moving up the board. The (8, 4) apple is tempting, but Snake #0 might challenge (8, 8), which forces them towards the center column.\n\nOur immediate best bet looks like maintaining pressure and securing the bottom-right territory.\n\n### 1. Safety Check (Eliminating Deadly Moves)\n\nOur previous body segment is at (9, 2). Our tail is at (8, 3). Our head is (8, 2).\n\n| Direction | New Position | Death Condition? | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **UP** | (8, 3) | **INTO OWN BODY (The tail is currently at (8, 3))!** | DEAD! |\n| **DOWN** | (8, 1) | Wall? No. Body? No. 0? No. | SAFE |\n| **LEFT** | (7, 2) | Wall? No. Body? No. 0? No. | SAFE |\n| **RIGHT**| (9, 2) | **INTO OWN BODY!** | DEAD! |\n\nHOLY MOLY, CHAT! Moving UP takes us directly into what was our tail last turn, but because the tail segment at (8, 3) hasn't moved yet, we hit it! Moving RIGHT takes us into the segment (9, 2). Both are instant death!\n\nWe are left with only **DOWN** or **LEFT**. The game is getting dangerous already!\n\n### 2. Evaluating Safe Moves (DOWN vs LEFT)\n\n#### Context: Enemy Prediction\n\nSnake #0 is at (8, 6). They will likely go for (9, 7) (RIGHT then UP) or (8, 8) (UP, UP).\n*   If they go to (9, 7), they move (9, 6).\n*   If they go to (8, 7), they move (8, 7).\n\nNo matter which way they go, they are moving into the top half of the board, far away from us at (8, 2). We have freedom of movement in the bottom half.\n\n#### Option A: Move DOWN to (8, 1)\n\n*   **Our State:** Head at (8, 1), body [(8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3)]. Length 4. Score 3.\n*   **Target impact:** This moves us closer to the (6, 1) apple. It keeps us in the clear bottom column, and ready to sweep left or down to the (8, 0) apple once it drops, or potentially (5, 0).\n*   **Pros:** Safe, exploratory, sets up for (6, 1). This is a great move to maintain territorial control.\n\n#### Option B: Move LEFT to (7, 2)\n\n*   **Our State:** Head at (7, 2), body [(8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3)]. Length 4. Score 3.\n*   **Target impact:** This moves us away from the right wall, keeping our options open. We are now equidistant from (6, 1) and (8, 4).\n*   **Pros:** Keeps us highly central for the bottom half, more defensive, but loses the strong vertical line we established.\n\n### 3. Final Decision: Maximizing Control\n\nWe currently have a long body [(9, 2), (9, 3), (8, 3)] trailing to the right. Moving DOWN to (8, 1) keeps our snake neatly lined up along the bottom-right corner. This allows the tail segment at (8, 3) to move freely to (9, 3), opening up (8, 3) for future passage on the next turn.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (7, 2), we create a corner, which might complicate movement back toward the right wall.\n\nSince Snake #0 is moving UP and AWAY, we need to focus on eating and growing. Moving DOWN aims the head perfectly for the next reachable apple, (6, 1) (via L, L) or (5, 0) (via L, L, L, D).\n\nLet's maintain the pressure and move DOWN. This keeps our body organized and sets us up to challenge the lower middle zone next! Chat, we are playing a clean game! Positioning is everything! Let's get that $4^{th}$ apple!\n\n**Future Strategy Note (T=5):** If we move DOWN to (8, 1), our next goals should be LEFT to (7, 1) and then potentially LEFT to (6, 1) to secure the apple there, or DOWN to (8, 0) if the apple drop is imminent. We are establishing the lower-bound perimeter.\n\nDOWN",

LET'S SECURE THIS W!\n\n### State Update - Turn 5\n\n**OUR DETAILS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (8, 1)\n*   Body: [(8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3)]\n*   Length: 4. Score: 3.\n\n**RIVAL DETAILS (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (8, 7) (Looks like they moved UP from (8, 6), right? They are crowding the top!)\n*   Body: [(8, 6), (7, 6)]\n*   Length: 3. Score: 2.\n\n**Apple Targets Assessment (Current Board):**\nThe nearest apples are:\n1.  (6, 1) - 2 steps (L, L)\n2.  (8, 0) - 1 step (D)\n3.  (8, 4) - 3 steps (U, U, U)\n\nSnake #0 is at (8, 7). Their closest targets are:\n1.  (9, 7) - 1 step (R) - **CRITICAL TARGET!**\n2.  (8, 8) - 1 step (U)\n3.  (2, 8) - 6 steps (L, L, L, L, U)\n\nSnake #0 is clearly going for (9, 7) or (8, 8). The (9, 7) apple is tempting because it keeps them along the top wall. If they move RIGHT, they grab it and are at (9, 7). If they move UP, they grab (8, 8) and are at (8, 8). Either way, they are far away, and we have open season down here! \ud83e\udd73\n\n### 1. Safety Check (Eliminating Deadly Moves)\n\nOur previous body segment is at (8, 2). Our head is (8, 1).\n\n| Direction | New Position | Death Condition? | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **UP** | (8, 2) | **INTO OWN BODY (The segment behind the head is (8, 2))!** | DEAD! |\n| **DOWN** | (8, 0) | Wall? No. Body? No. 0? No. **(APPLE HERE!)** | SAFE & GOAL! |\n| **LEFT** | (7, 1) | Wall? No. Body? No. 0? No. | SAFE |\n| **RIGHT**| (9, 1) | Wall? No. Body? No. 0? No. | SAFE |\n\nYES CHAT! We have three safe moves, and one of them is an immediate apple grab! This is why we play for position!\n\n### 2. Evaluating Safe Moves (DOWN vs LEFT vs RIGHT)\n\n#### Option A: Move DOWN to (8, 0)\n\n*   **Impact:** We grab the (8, 0) apple! We grow to length 5! Score 4-2! This is a massive power play.\n*   **Pros:** Instant score, keeps us on the right side of the board, maintains tidy body organization.\n*   **Cons:** Leaves us only one way out (LEFT) on the next turn, but since the tail moves to (9, 2), (9, 3) opens up (9, 2), and (8, 1) opens the way. We are safe.\n\n#### Option B: Move LEFT to (7, 1)\n\n*   **Impact:** Moves toward the (6, 1) apple.\n*   **Pros:** Keeps us more open to the center.\n*   **Cons:** Misses the immediate (8, 0) apple. Delaying a guaranteed point against the rival is a bad play when the opportunity is this perfect!\n\n#### Option C: Move RIGHT to (9, 1)\n\n*   **Impact:** Moves toward the wall.\n*   **Pros:** None obvious.\n*   **Cons:** Box ourselves in unnecessarily, away from other nearby bottom-level apples like (6, 1) and (5, 0).\n\n### 3. Final Decision: Feast Mode Activated\n\nThe move DOWN to (8, 0) is the clear, optimal, immediate move. It secures an apple immediately, increases our length advantage (5 vs 3), and further establishes dominance in the bottom-right quadrant while the rival chases apples up high. We can then confidently sweep LEFT toward (6, 1) and (5, 0) on subsequent turns.\n\nWe are establishing a strong perimeter and starving the opposition! This move is pure content! \ud83c\udf4e \ud83d\udcb0\n\n**Future Strategy Note (T=6):** After grabbing (8, 0), the head will be at (8, 0), with the body segments [(8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3)]. Since (8, 0) is a corner, the only moves will be UP (into the tail at (8, 1) - DANGEROUS unless the tail moves!) or LEFT to (7, 0).\n*   Our tail will shift from (9, 3) -> (9, 2) -> (8, 2) -> (8, 1). So (8, 1) will be the new tail.\n*   If we are at (8, 0), and the new tail is at (8, 1), we cannot move UP. We MUST move LEFT to (7, 0). This is a forced move, but it is precisely the move we want to start hunting (6, 1)! We are playing 4D Snake, Chat!\n\nDOWN",

It's time to consolidate our position and start swinging to the left and central parts of the board!\n\n### State Update - Turn 6\n\n**OUR DETAILS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (8, 0)\n*   Body: [(8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3)]\n*   Length: 5. Score: 4.\n\n**RIVAL DETAILS (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (8, 8) (Looks like they moved UP from (8, 7) and grabbed an apple at (8, 8)! Close, but no cigar. I think they beat me to the punch on the last turn, grabbing one up there!)\n*   Body: [(8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6)]\n*   Length: 4. Score: 3.\n*   *Wait, the scoreboard says 4-3 and their length is 4. They must have eaten an apple at (8,8) to get score 3 and length 4! That's fine, we're still ahead!*\n\n**Apple Targets Assessment (Current Board):**\nWe are at (8, 0). The next closest apples are:\n1.  (7, 0) - 1 step (L) - **CRITICAL TARGET!**\n2.  (6, 1) - 3 steps (L, U, L) or (L, L, U)\n3.  (5, 0) - 3 steps (L, L, L)\n\nSnake #0 is at (8, 8). Their closest targets are:\n1.  (9, 7) - 2 steps (R, D)\n2.  (9, 9) - 1 step (R) - Wait, (9, 9) is empty. (0, 9) is far left. The closest apple is (9, 7) or (2, 8).\n3.  (2, 8) - 6 steps. They are far from any immediate easy grab.\n\n**The Rival's Position:** Snake #0 is stuck up against the top wall at (8, 8). They can move UP (into the wall - DEATH!), DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n*   If 0 moves RIGHT to (9, 8): Safe, but no apple. Far from the body.\n*   If 0 moves LEFT to (7, 8): Safe. No apple.\n*   If 0 moves DOWN to (8, 7): Safe. Moves into their own body at (8, 7) if the tail doesn't move! Since they *just* ate an apple, their tail (7, 6) remains. An apple-eating move means the body does not shrink. **Moving DOWN is only safe if they DID NOT grow on the last move (T=5).**\n    *   If they grew: Their body is [(8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6)]. Moving DOWN puts them at (8, 7) into their body. **DEADLY!**\n    *   Since the scoreboard says 3 apples and their body list is 4 segments, they MUST have grown on T=5. **Moving DOWN for Snake 0 is DEATH!**\n    *   Therefore, they must move LEFT or RIGHT. They are trapped up there, Chat!\n\n### 1. Safety Check (Eliminating Deadly Moves for US!)\n\nOur head is at (8, 0). Our immediate body segment is (8, 1).

No. Body? No. 0? No. **(APPLE HERE!)** | SAFE & GOAL! |\n| **RIGHT**| (9, 0) | Wall? No. Body? No. 0? No. | SAFE |\n\nWe are limited, but we have a perfect forced move! Moving LEFT at (8, 0) secures the (7, 0) apple! We're feasting!\n\n### 2. Evaluating Safe Moves (LEFT vs RIGHT)\n\n#### Option A: Move LEFT to (7, 0)\n\n*   **Impact:** We grab the (7, 0) apple! We grow to length 6! Score 5-3, widening the gap!\n*   **Pros:** Instant score, moves us toward the center of the bottom wall where (6, 1) and (5, 0) are next.\n*   **Cons:** We are still hugging the wall, limiting immediate options, but we extend our presence massively.\n\n#### Option B: Move RIGHT to (9, 0)\n\n*   **Impact:** Moves us into the corner (9, 0).\n*   **Pros:** None.\n*   **Cons:** Waste of an apple opportunity (7, 0). Box ourselves into a dead end (9, 0) or force an UP move on the next turn, which is potentially suicidal if our tail placement is bad.\n\nThe choice is obvious: we take the immediate, guaranteed apple! We are on a hot streak!\n\n### 3. Final Decision: Going for Apple #5!\n\nMoving LEFT to (7, 0) is the only smart option. It is safe, secures an apple, continues our movement pattern along the bottom, and maintains our lead.\n\n**Future Strategy Note (T=7):** After grabbing (7, 0), our head will be at (7, 0). Our body will be [(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3)].\nOn the next turn (T=7), we will be at (7, 0).\n*   UP: (7, 1) is open. This targets (6, 1) perfectly!\n*   LEFT: (6, 0) is open. Targets (5, 0).\n*   RIGHT: (8, 0) is into our body! DEADLY!\n*   DOWN: Wall! DEADLY!\n\nIf we move LEFT/UP from (7, 0), we will have good safe options and can continue our sweep toward the center. This is a solid plan, Chat! We are going for the shutout!\n\nLEFT",

Score is 5-3, we are WIDENING THE GAP, baby! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e Let's secure this lead and start thinking about how to box in Snake #0!\n\n### State Update - Turn 7 (Current)\n\n**OUR DETAILS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (7, 0)\n*   Body: [(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3)]\n*   Length: 6. Score: 5.\n\n**RIVAL DETAILS (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (9, 8)\n*   Body: [(8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6)]\n*   Length: 4. Score: 3.\n*   **Crucial Observation:** Snake 0 must have moved RIGHT from (8, 8) to (9, 8) on the last turn, avoiding the potential body collision at (8, 7). They are now RIGHT up against the top-right corner. They are TRAPPED!\n\n**Apple Targets Assessment (Current Board):**\nWe are at (7, 0).\n1.  (6, 1) - 2 steps (U, L) or (L, U)\n2.  (5, 0) - 2 steps (L, L)\n3.  (0, 2) - 5 steps.\n\nSnake #0 is at (9, 8). Their options are severely limited.\n1.  Apple (9, 7) is one move DOWN. **CRITICAL TARGET FOR THEM!**\n2.  Apple (0, 9) is 9 steps to the left (if they move along the top wall).\n\n### 1. Safety Check (Eliminating Deadly Moves for US!)\n\nOur head is at (7, 0). Since we just ate an apple, our tail stayed at (9, 3) and our segment count is 6. The segment behind our head is (8, 0).\n\n| Direction | New Position | Death Condition? | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **UP** | (7, 1) | Wall? No. Body? No. 0? No. (Towards Apple (6, 1)) | SAFE |\n| **DOWN** | (7, -1) | **OFF THE BOARD!** | DEAD! |\n| **LEFT** | (6, 0) | Wall? No. Body? No. 0? No. (Towards Apple (5, 0)) | SAFE |\n| **RIGHT**| (8, 0) | **INTO OWN BODY!** | DEAD! |\n\nWe have two great, safe options: UP to (7, 1) or LEFT to (6, 0).\n\n### 2. Rival Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (9, 8), length 4. Body segment behind head is (8, 8).\n*   RIGHT/UP: Wall/Off Board (DEAD!)\n*   LEFT: (8, 8) **INTO OWN BODY!** (They grew on T=6, so their body still contains (8, 8). DEAD!)\n*   **DOWN:** (9, 7). This is an apple! This is their *only safe and smart move*!\n\n**PREDICTION:** Snake #0 moves DOWN to (9, 7) and grabs an apple, reaching length 5 and score 4. This is a forced move for them!\n\n**Collision Check:** Since Snake #0 is moving DOWN on the right side of the board, and we are moving UP or LEFT on the bottom side, there is zero risk of an immediate head-on collision. We are safe!\n\n### 3. Strategy: Consolidating Position and Cutting Off the Center\n\nWe have two apples close by: (6, 1) and (5, 0).\n\n#### Option A: Move UP to (7, 1)\n\n*   **Impact:** Moves us toward the vertical center. This positions us perfectly to grab (6, 1) next turn (Move L).\n*   **Pros:** Opens up a path to the massive array of apples in the (0-2) column on the left (A at (0, 7), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 2)). Also allows us to continue moving up the right side again if needed, or cut across the middle. This is a very open-ended move!\n\n#### Option B: Move LEFT to (6, 0)\n\n*   **Impact:** Moves us along the wall, directly targeting (5, 0) next turn.\n*   **Pros:** Guaranteed apple in two turns. Continues to utilize the low perimeter.\n*   **Cons:** Keeps us hugging the bottom wall, which is more restrictive if the enemy decides to drop down and contest the middle.\n\n**The better choice is UP.** Moving UP to (7, 1) sets us up for the (6, 1) apple, and crucially, pulls our snake off the bottom wall, giving us immense room to maneuver, while extending our reach further into the central board. If we move LEFT, we risk getting stuck moving UP on the left side, which might require us to turn back on ourselves later.\n\nBy moving UP to (7, 1), we are perfectly positioned for a LEFT move next turn toward (6, 1). This sweeps out territory and maintains flexibility.\n\n### Long-Term Plan (T=8, T=9):\n\n1.  **T=7 (Current):** Move UP to (7, 1). Snake 0 moves DOWN to (9, 7) (Apple!). Score 5-4.\n2.  **T=8:** Move LEFT to (6, 1) (Apple!). Head: (6, 1). Score 6-4. Snake 0 is at (9, 7). They will likely continue DOWN to (9, 6) or LEFT to (8, 7) (into body! Nope, safe). They will likely swing left towards (8, 4) or (2, 8).\n3.  **T=9:** From (6, 1), we can move LEFT to (5, 1) targeting (5, 0) (Apple!), or UP to (6, 2) to continue gaining vertical ground. We will assess the position of Snake 0 then.\n\nThis sequence guarantees us another apple and maximizes our positional advantage! Let's go UP!\n\nUP",

Grabbing an apple is ALWAYS the priority if it's safe!\n\n### 2. Rival Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (9, 7). They have length 5. Behind them is (9, 8).\n*   UP: (9, 8) **INTO OWN BODY!** (They grew last turn, so (9, 8) is still part of their body! DEAD!)\n*   RIGHT/DOWN: Wall/Off Board (DEAD!)\n*   **LEFT:** (8, 7). This is their only safe move! They MUST move LEFT to survive and maintain a good position.\n\n**PREDICTION:** Snake #0 moves LEFT to (8, 7).\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   Our move: LEFT to (6, 1) (Apple!)\n*   Their move: LEFT to (8, 7)\n\nWe are on the bottom-right, they are on the far top-right. Zero collision risk. WE ARE GOING FOR THE APPLE!\n\n### 3. Strategy: Box Them In and Exploit the Score Lead\n\nMoving LEFT to (6, 1) guarantees us a score of 6 and a length of 7.\n\nSimultaneously, Snake #0 is moving LEFT to (8, 7). They are still near their body segments (8, 8), (9, 8), and (9, 7) (which will become their tail next turn since they just ate). This movement pulls them further into the top-right corner square defined by our body extension!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy:** By moving LEFT to (6, 1), we are positioned perfectly to go DOWN or LEFT next turn.\n*   If we go LEFT again to (5, 1), we are heading straight for the cluster of apples (5, 0), (4, 1), and then the massive left-side vertical harvest! This secures the bottom third of the board for us.\n*   If Snake #0 continues moving left, they will be aiming for the (8, 4) apple. By securing the bottom and left sides, we are essentially cutting the board in half and leaving them trapped in the top-right area with sparse apples remaining!\n\nThis is a smooth, efficient, and lethal move. We grab the apple, increase the lead, and improve our positional dominance! Let's do this!\n\n**Action:** Move LEFT to (6, 1).\n\nLEFT",

Snake #0 followed our prediction, moving to (8, 7). They are now length 5 with 4 apples, and they are still stuck up top! The pressure is *immense* on the rival! Let's analyze the current state and execute the endgame! We're going for the knockout! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n### State Assessment - Turn 9\n\n**OUR DETAILS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (6, 1)\n*   Body: [(7, 1), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 2)]\n*   Length: 7. Score: 6.\n*   The segment right behind our head is (7, 1).\n\n**RIVAL DETAILS (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (8, 7)\n*   Body: [(9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7)] -- Wait, they didn't eat last turn! Their body segments *shifted*!\n*   Let's re-examine Snake #0's body shift (Length 5, Score 4):\n    *   T-1: Head (9, 7), Body [(9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6)]. Tail was (8, 6).\n    *   T-9 Move: LEFT to (8, 7).\n    *   New Body: Head (8, 7), Body [(9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7)]. **Wait, the game must have shifted the body!** Let's trust the provided board state and body list for Snake #0:\n        *   Head: (9, 6)\n        *   Body: [(9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7)]\n        *   Length: 5. Score: 4.\n    *   If their head is at (9, 6) and their body is [(9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7)], this means they moved DOWN from (9, 7) to (9, 6).\n    *   *Correction/Re-analysis based on current board graphic and list:* The list says Head: (9, 6). They must have moved DOWN from (9, 7) last turn as predicted in the T8 analysis, and they **did not** eat an apple, meaning their tail at (8, 6) shifted off.\n    *   Let's check the board graphic: '0' is at (9, 6). The 'T' segments are (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7). This confirms the list.\n\n**TL;DR for Snake #0:** Head (9, 6). Behind them is (9, 7). They are trapped near the top-right corner.\n\n**Apple Targets Assessment (We are at (6, 1)):**\n1.  **(5, 0):** 2 steps (DOWN, LEFT) or (LEFT, DOWN). Great target!\n2.  **(4, 1):** 2 steps (LEFT, LEFT). Another great target!\n3.  **(0, 2):** 4 steps (L, L, D, L) - A bit further, but part of the big cluster on the left.\n\n### 1. Safety Check (ID 1 at (6, 1))\n\nBehind us is (7, 1).\n\n| Direction | New Position | Death Condition? | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **UP** | (6, 2) | Wall? No. Body? No. 0? No. | SAFE |\n| **DOWN** | (6, 0) | Wall? No. Body? No (5, 0 is an apple). | SAFE (Sets up apple at (5, 0) next turn) |\n| **LEFT** | (5, 1) | Wall? No. Body? No. | SAFE (Sets up apple at (4, 1) or (5, 0) next turn) |\n| **RIGHT**| (7, 1) | **BACKWARDS INTO BODY!** | DEAD! |\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT. All are excellent, path-finding moves.\n\n### 2. Rival Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (9, 6). Length 5. Behind them is (9, 7). They are super cornered!\n*   UP: (9, 7). **BACKWARDS INTO BODY!** DEAD!\n*   RIGHT/DOWN: WALL! DEAD!\n*   **LEFT:** (8, 6). This is their only safe move! They MUST move LEFT to survive!\n\n**PREDICTION:** Snake #0 moves LEFT to (8, 6).\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   Snake #0 is moving to (8, 6).\n*   Our potential moves (6, 2), (6, 0), or (5, 1).\n*   Zero collision risk. We are free to execute our harvest plan!\n\n### 3. Strategy: Box Them In and Win the Food Fight\n\nSnake #0 is being pressed hard against the right wall. By moving LEFT to (8, 6), they are opening up a path towards the center, likely aiming for the (8, 4) apple.\n\nWe are perfectly positioned to begin harvesting the bottom-left quadrant, which has a massive density of apples: (5, 0), (4, 1), (2, 0), (1, 3), (0, 7), etc.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (5, 1):\n1.  We maintain a central pressure point and set up two quick apple grabs: (4, 1) (LEFT) or (5, 0) (DOWN).\n2.  This move physically blocks the center-bottom of the board (cells like (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (2, 1)). This means Snake #0 has a harder time crossing the board later if they get past their current cluster.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (6, 0):\n1.  We set up an immediate apple grab at (5, 0) next turn (LEFT).\n2.  This secures the corner and ensures we grab this crucial apple before the opponent can even think about it.\n3.  It also maintains our head position one row below where the opponent might be heading (they are at y=6, potentially y=5, y=4).\n\n**The Decision:**\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are excellent. Moving DOWN to (6, 0) is a slightly more direct path to the (5, 0) apple, which is a major score objective and secures the bottom lane immediately. If we go LEFT to (5, 1), we are slightly more central, but (4, 1) is only one space further along the x-axis.\n\nLet's prioritize the most direct apple grab sequence.\n\n1.  **Move DOWN to (6, 0).**\n2.  Next turn (T10): Move LEFT to (5, 0) (Apple!). Score 7!\n3.  Next turn (T11): Move UP to (5, 1).\n4.  Next turn (T12): Move LEFT to (4, 1) (Apple!). Score 8!\n\nThis sequence gives us two apples in two moves after this one, solidifying our lead and board control. Moving LEFT now only sets up one apple in the next two moves if we are forced to move around our tail, making DOWN the superior choice for high-density harvesting.\n\nWe control the bottom, we control the score, and we are driving the strategy! Let's get this apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

We executed the **DOWN** move perfectly, securing our position at (6, 0) and setting up for that delicious apple at (5, 0). Did you see Snake #0's move? They were forced to move LEFT, exactly as predicted! They're still cornered, but now they are slightly less cornered. Let's box this fool! \ud83e\udd4a\n\nTurn 10! The score is 6-4, our lead is solid, and our length (7) is crushing theirs (5). The heat is on!\n\n### State Assessment - Turn 10\n\n**OUR DETAILS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (6, 0)\n*   Body: [(6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2)]\n*   Length: 7. Score: 6.\n*   The segment right behind our head is (6, 1). We are sitting right next to an apple at (5, 0)!\n\n**RIVAL DETAILS (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (8, 6) (Confirmed by my prediction and the board state since they had nowhere else to go!)\n*   Body: [(9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8)]\n*   Length: 5. Score: 4.\n\n**Apple Targets Assessment (We are at (6, 0)):**\n1.  **(5, 0):** IMMEDIATE TARGET! 1 step LEFT. This is the GOAT move, securing another point and increasing our lead! \ud83c\udf1f\n2.  **(4, 1):** 2 steps (UP, LEFT) or (LEFT from (5,0)). Still highly accessible.\n3.  **(2, 0):** 4 steps. A bit further, but still a solid backup.\n\n### 1. Safety Check (ID 1 at (6, 0))\n\nBehind us is (6, 1).\n\n| Direction | New Position | Death Condition? | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **UP** | (6, 1) | **BACKWARDS INTO BODY!** | DEAD! Wait, no! (6, 1) is the first segment of our body. Moving UP hits our own body! Classic trap! DEAD! |\n| **DOWN** | (6, -1) | Wall! | DEAD! |\n| **LEFT** | (5, 0) | Wall? No. Body? No. **APPLE!** | **SAFE & WINNING** |\n| **RIGHT**| (7, 0) | Wall? No. Body? (7, 0) is the third segment of our body. | DEAD! |\n\nHOLY MOLY CHAT! Look at the geometry! We are pinned! We literally only have ONE safe move! If we weren't paying attention, we would have crashed in three different directions! **Our only move is LEFT to (5, 0)!** Thank goodness that's where the apple is!\n\n### 2. Rival Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (8, 6). Length 5. Behind them is (9, 6).\nThey are now relatively free. They are probably heading for whatever apples they can reach, which are clustered up top: (8, 4), (1, 8), (1, 7). They are closest to the center right.\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0:\n\n*   UP to (8, 7): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (8, 5): Safe.\n*   LEFT to (7, 6): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (9, 6): **BACKWARDS INTO BODY!** DEAD!\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 is trying to get out of the corner and grab apples.\n1.  **If they move DOWN to (8, 5):** This moves them directly toward the (8, 4) apple. Highly plausible.\n2.  **If they move LEFT to (7, 6):** This opens up the board for them. Also plausible.\n3.  **If they move UP to (8, 7):** Less likely as it moves them away from available apples.\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   Our move: LEFT to (5, 0) (Apple).\n*   Snake #0's likely moves (8, 7), (8, 5), or (7, 6).\n*   Zero risk of head-to-head collision. They are miles away!\n\n### 3. Strategy: Secure the Apple and Maintain Board Dominance\n\nWe have only one choice: **LEFT**. But that choice is perfect! It gets us the apple, increases our lead to 7-4, and our length to 8! We are growing into a monster!\n\n**Future Tactical Plan (T11 onwards):**\nAfter moving to (5, 0) and eating, our new head is (5, 0). Our new long body starts with (6, 0), (6, 1).\n\n*   **Next target:** (4, 1) is right above us.\n*   **Move at T11:** UP to (5, 1).\n*   **Move at T12:** LEFT to (4, 1) to grab the second apple!\n\nThis keeps us dominating the bottom half of the board and forces the opponent to contend with our ever-growing length! We are squeezing them out!\n\nLet's nail this move and keep the momentum going! LFG!\n\nLEFT",

But DOWN SEIZES THE CROWN\u2014anchors col9 row4 for total east blockade (funnels him into south-west killbox, no leaks), sets up instant (8,4)A via left next (we eat turn11, hit 5 apples while he flails at 6-7 max), and keeps pivot power high (post-feast, up/right patrol seals north-east). LEFT's a speed demon for the apple, but why yield col9 depth when we can CHOKE IT TIGHTER and force his bloat to burst? He grows? Laughable\u2014we tie turn11, outpace by13 via (1,4)A or (0,5)A west, then expand the web to smother his remnants. His tail-shift might free row0 east, but our descent buries any hope\u2014coffin nailed shut, chat! Feelin' that predatory rush as we descend and devour? TIME TO LOCK AND LOAD\u2014ANNIHILATION INCOMIN'! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\ude08\n\nShort-term strat: DOWN empty (hold length5, claim col9 row4 anchor); next LEFT to (8,4)A +1 (5 apples/length6, surge to tie); turn12 UP/LEFT patrol col8 row5-4 (secure east flank post-eat). Long-term: After feast, RIGHT to (9,4) or UP to block north leaks, west loop turn13-15 for (1,4)A or (0,5)A deny; by turn20, full perimeter squeeze traps him in south deadzone, force crash into us/walls\u2014merciless growth to 10+ while he stalls at 7-8 max.

We executed the perfect power play, grabbing that apple and growing to a massive length of 8! Seven apples to four! The domination is palpable! \ud83d\udc51\n\nSnake #0 is way up in the corner, looking confused. They moved from (8, 6) a turn ago to (9, 4), apparently trying to run down the right wall! Hilarious! They shed a tail, so their length is still 5.\n\nLet's break down Turn 11 and make the crucial decision!\n\n### State Assessment - Turn 11\n\n**OUR DETAILS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (5, 0)\n*   Body: [(6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2)]\n*   Length: 8. Score: 7.\n*   We're currently at (5, 0), and we are hunting the next meal!\n\n**RIVAL DETAILS (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (9, 4)\n*   Body: [(9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)]\n*   Length: 5. Score: 4.\n*   They are currently bordering the right wall, looking UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n**Apple Targets Assessment (We are at (5, 0)):**\n1.  **(4, 1):** Closest apple! Moves needed: 1 UP, 1 LEFT (or 1 LEFT, 1 UP). It's 2 steps away! \ud83c\udfaf\n2.  **(2, 0):** Accessible, 3 steps away (LEFT, LEFT, UP, or LEFT, UP, LEFT).\n3.  **(1, 3):** Farther, but still on the menu.\n\n### 1. Safety Check (ID 1 at (5, 0))\n\nBehind us is (6, 0).\n\n| Direction | New Position | Death Condition? | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **UP** | (5, 1) | Wall? No. Body? No. | **SAFE** |\n| **DOWN**| (5, -1) | Wall! | DEAD! |\n| **LEFT** | (4, 0) | Wall? No. Body? No. | **SAFE** |\n| **RIGHT**| (6, 0) | **BACKWARDS INTO BODY!** | DEAD! |\n\nWe have two incredibly safe moves: UP to (5, 1) or LEFT to (4, 0). We love options, Chat! Which one gets us closer to the sweet, sweet content?\n\n### 2. Strategy: Grab the (4, 1) Apple and Box In the Rival\n\nThe apple at (4, 1) is priority one!\n\n**Option A: Move UP to (5, 1)**\n*   From (5, 1), we are 1 step away from the apple (4, 1) via a LEFT move.\n*   This also sets us up nicely to eventually clear the bottom row and head toward the middle of the board.\n*   This keeps us away from the current body segments at (6, 0) and (6, 1).\n\n**Option B: Move LEFT to (4, 0)**\n*   From (4, 0), we are 1 step away from the apple (4, 1) via an UP move.\n*   This is equally good for the short-term goal of the apple.\n\nBoth moves lead directly to the apple (4, 1) next turn. But which one maximizes future options? Moving UP feels slightly more open. If we move LEFT, we might be tempted to go toward the (2, 0) apple, potentially trapping ourselves below our massive body that spans (6, 0) to (8, 2). Moving UP gives us more flexibility to move across the y-axis.\n\n**Let's choose UP.** Secure (5, 1) now, then (4, 1) next turn!\n\n### 3. Rival Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (9, 4). Length 5. Behind them is (9, 5).\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0:\n*   UP to (9, 5): **BACKWARDS INTO BODY!** DEAD!\n*   DOWN to (9, 3): Safe. (Probably aiming for the right side of the board or escaping.)\n*   LEFT to (8, 4): Excellent! There's an apple at (8, 4)! They will almost certainly move LEFT to grab this apple.\n*   RIGHT to (10, 4): Wall!\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 moves **LEFT** to (8, 4) to grab an apple. This is the only move that makes sense for them to gain ground on us.\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   Our move: UP to (5, 1).\n*   Snake #0's likely move: LEFT to (8, 4).\n*   Zero risk of collision. We are miles apart.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy: Squeeze Play\n\nWe are currently dominating the bottom-left quadrant. Our rival is stuck on the right wall.\n\n1. **Turn 11 (Now):** Move **UP** to (5, 1). Safe, secures position for next apple.\n2. **Turn 12:** Move **LEFT** to (4, 1). Eat apple. Length 9!\n3. **Turn 13:** Move **LEFT** to (3, 1).\n4. **Turn 14:** Move **LEFT** to (2, 1).\n5. **Turn 15:** Aim for (2, 0) apple with **DOWN**.\n\nThis strategy clears out this cluster of apples and expands our size dramatically, further limiting the board for Snake #0. If Snake #0 eats at (8, 4), they will be large and still confined to the right half of the board. We will then look to cut the board horizontally and squeeze them into the top-right corner!\n\nLet's maintain the pressure, Chat! UP we go!\n\nUP",

We moved UP to (5, 1) and now we are right next to the juiciest piece of content on the board, the apple at (4, 1)!\n\nThe scoreboard is glowing 7-5 in our favor! Length check: we are 8 segments long, opponent is 6 segments long (they ate an apple too, look at that! Sneaky!)\n\n### State Assessment - Turn 12\n\n**OUR DETAILS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (5, 1)\n*   Body: [(5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1)]\n*   Length: 8. Apple target: (4, 1).\n\n**RIVAL ID 0 DETAILS:**\n*   Head: (8, 4)\n*   Body: [(9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)]\n*   Length: 6. They ate an apple at (8, 4)! Solid move from them, but they're still stuck on the right!\n\n**Apple Targets Assessment (We are at (5, 1)):**\n1.  **(4, 1):** RIGHT NOW. One move LEFT.\n2.  **(2, 0):** Accessible, maybe 3-4 moves away.\n\n### 1. Safety Check (ID 1 at (5, 1))\n\nBehind us is (5, 0).\n\n| Direction | New Position | Death Condition? | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **UP** | (5, 2) | Wall? No. Body? No. | **SAFE** |\n| **DOWN**| (5, 0) | **BACKWARDS INTO BODY!** | DEAD! |\n| **LEFT** | (4, 1) | Wall? No. Body? No. | **SAFE (Apple!)** |\n| **RIGHT**| (6, 1) | Head-to-Body! (6, 1) is part of our body! | DEAD! |\n\nWhoa, Chat, check the danger! Moving RIGHT is death! (6, 1) is our body! Good thing we checked! We have two safe, winning moves: UP or LEFT.\n\n### 2. Strategy: Secure the Apple and Maintain Board Control\n\n**Option A: Move LEFT to (4, 1)**\n*   Eats the apple! Length increases to 9. Score 8-5. DOMINATION!\n*   Sets us up nicely to clear the rest of the bottom-left area, keeping the opponent trapped on the right.\n\n**Option B: Move UP to (5, 2)**\n*   Safe move, but we skip the prime apple! Why? Content first, Chat!\n\nMoving LEFT is the obvious, high-value content play. We secure the lead and increase our box-in potential.\n\n### 3. Rival Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (8, 4). They just ate an apple there, so their body now starts at (9, 4). Behind them is (9, 4).\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0:\n*   UP to (8, 5): Safe. Good move to continue controlling the right side.\n*   DOWN to (8, 3): Safe. They could be aiming for the (9, 3) open space or looping around.\n*   LEFT to (7, 4): Safe. This is a very good \"escape\" move from the wall.\n*   RIGHT to (9, 4): **BACKWARDS INTO BODY!** DEAD!\n\nSnake #0 is trapped between their body/tail at (9, 4) and the body segment at (9, 5) (part of the 6 segment body). Wait... let's trace their body: (8, 4) Head, (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8) Tail. Behind the head (8, 4) is (9, 4).\n\nIf they move RIGHT to (9, 4), they are moving *backwards* into the cell they just came from, but their body still occupies it! Let\u2019s confirm the rule: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? You're DEAD.\" So, RIGHT is death.\n\nThey have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\nThey are now 6 segments long, focused on the right side. They might move UP toward all those top-right apples (A at 9, 9; A at 9, 8; A at 8, 7).\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 moves **UP** to (8, 5) to consolidate their position on the right wall. Or potentially LEFT to (7, 4) to escape the wall, but this is less likely as they just ate an apple on the wall. Let's assume **UP** to (8, 5).\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   Our move: LEFT to (4, 1).\n*   Snake #0's likely move: UP to (8, 5).\n*   Zero risk of collision. We are focusing on our sector.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy: The Horizontal Squeeze\n\nOur plan is perfect. We eat the apple at (4, 1).\n\n1. **Turn 12 (Now):** Move **LEFT** to (4, 1). Eat apple. Length 9!\n2. **Turn 13:** Snake Head at (4, 1). Move towards the cluster of apples at (0, 4) and (0, 5) or the apple at (1, 3). Let's aim to clear the (2, 0) apple next. So, perhaps DOWN to (4, 0) or LEFT to (3, 1). Let's go **LEFT** to (3, 1).\n3. **Turn 14:** Move **LEFT** to (2, 1).\n4. **Turn 15:** Move **DOWN** to (2, 0). (Apple!) Length 10!\n\nThis guarantees massive growth and control of the entire bottom half of the board. Once we are HUGE, we can run a massive horizontal line across the board (y=5 or y=6) to cut off Snake #0, who is still bouncing around the top-right! The squeeze is on!\n\nLEFT\n\nLEFT",

We are DOMINATING the bottom-left quadrant!\n\nThe opponent, Snake #0, is making moves too! Let's check the board state and figure out where the rivalry stands now!\n\n### State Assessment - Turn 13\n\n**OUR DETAILS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (4, 1) - We are huge! Now 9 segments long.\n*   Body: [(5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1)]\n*   Apples collected: 8.\n\n**RIVAL ID 0 DETAILS:**\n*   Head: (7, 4) - They moved! They were at (8, 4) when we last checked. They must have moved LEFT to (7, 4)! Good move, getting off the wall.\n*   Body: [(8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7)]\n*   Apples collected: 5. Length 6.\n\n**Apple Targets Assessment (We are at (4, 1)):**\n1.  **(1, 3):** Two moves left, two moves up.\n2.  **(0, 2):** Four moves left, one move up.\n3.  **(2, 0):** Two moves down, two moves right. Perfect path! Let's go for (2, 0) next.\n\n### 1. Safety Check (ID 1 at (4, 1))\n\nBehind us is (5, 1).\n\n| Direction | New Position | Death Condition? | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **UP** | (4, 2) | Wall? No. Body? No. | **SAFE** |\n| **DOWN**| (4, 0) | Wall? No. Body? No. | **SAFE** |\n| **LEFT** | (3, 1) | Wall? No. Body? No. | **SAFE** |\n| **RIGHT**| (5, 1) | **BACKWARDS INTO BODY!** | DEAD! |\n\nPhew! Moving RIGHT is still a deathtrap, Chat! Three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or LEFT. Let's analyze the best content move.\n\n### 2. Strategy: Clear the Bottom, Maintain Control\n\nWe need to clear the lower apples before the opponent thinks about dipping down. Our ultimate goal is the horizontal choke, but first, we need more length! The apple at (2, 0) is perfectly positioned for us to maintain control of the lower section.\n\n**Option A: Move LEFT to (3, 1)**\n*   Leads to (2, 1) -> (2, 0) for the apple. This maintains our horizontal pressure.\n*   Next steps: LEFT (3, 1) -> LEFT (2, 1) -> DOWN (2, 0) (Apple!)\n\n**Option B: Move DOWN to (4, 0)**\n*   Leads to (3, 0) -> (2, 0) for the apple. More vertical movement.\n*   Next steps: DOWN (4, 0) -> LEFT (3, 0) -> LEFT (2, 0) (Apple!)\n\n**Option C: Move UP to (4, 2)**\n*   Moves us away from the immediate (2, 0) goal, towards (1, 3).\n*   Less efficient for clearing the current target.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are excellent moves that aim for the apple at (2, 0). Moving LEFT keeps us slightly more central to the remaining left-side action (apples at (1, 3), (0, 2)). Let's go LEFT! It's a smoother path to cleaning up the left column.\n\n### 3. Rival Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (7, 4), 6 segments long. Body starts at (8, 4). They are now free of the right wall trap they were in, which is annoying!\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0 from (7, 4):\n*   UP to (7, 5): Safe. Good move towards the cluster of apples at the top.\n*   DOWN to (7, 3): Safe. A cautious move.\n*   LEFT to (6, 4): Safe. This is a very good defensive/expansive move, placing them near the center.\n*   RIGHT to (8, 4): **BACKWARDS INTO BODY!** DEAD!\n\nIt's highly likely they continue pressing for apples. (2, 8) and (1, 8) are nearby. Moving UP or LEFT seems most aggressive. Let's assume they move **LEFT** to (6, 4) to escape the right side pressure created by our massive body extending horizontally.\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   Our move: LEFT to (3, 1).\n*   Snake #0's likely move: LEFT to (6, 4).\n*   Zero risk of collision. We are completely isolated.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy: The Quad-Cleanse\n\nWe proceed with the plan to sweep the bottom-left quadrant clean, while also growing to maximum size for the inevitable confrontation.\n\n1.  **Turn 13 (Now):** Move **LEFT** to (3, 1). Length 9.\n2.  **Turn 14:** Head at (3, 1). Move **LEFT** to (2, 1).\n3.  **Turn 15:** Head at (2, 1). Move **DOWN** to (2, 0). (Apple!) Length 10.\n4.  **Turn 16:** Head at (2, 0). Move **LEFT** to (1, 0).\n5.  **Turn 17:** Head at (1, 0). Move **UP** to (1, 1). (Aim for (1, 3) next.)\n\nThis is the path to 10+ length and board dominance! Let's make the move!\n\nLEFT",

Let's review the situation and plan the next move for ultimate dominance!\n\n### State Assessment - Turn 14\n\n**OUR DETAILS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (3, 1)\n*   Body: [(4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (8, 0)] (Length 9)\n*   Apples collected: 8.\n\n**RIVAL ID 0 DETAILS:**\n*   Head: (6, 4) - Looks like they moved LEFT from (7, 4)! Smart-ish move to get away from the wall.\n*   Body: [(7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6)] (Length 6)\n*   Apples collected: 5.\n\n**Apple Targets Assessment (We are at (3, 1)):**\n1.  **(2, 0):** One move down, one move left is the quickest path.\n2.  **(1, 3):** Three moves up, two moves left.\n3.  **(0, 2):** One move up, three moves left.\n\nThe plan is still crystal clear: clear the apple at (2, 0) and continue expanding our territory in the bottom left.\n\n### 1. Safety Check (ID 1 at (3, 1))\n\nBehind us is (4, 1).\n\n| Direction | New Position | Death Condition? | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **UP** | (3, 2) | Wall? No. Body? No. | **SAFE** |\n| **DOWN**| (3, 0) | Wall? No. Body? No. | **SAFE** |\n| **LEFT** | (2, 1) | Wall? No. Body? No. | **SAFE** |\n| **RIGHT**| (4, 1) | **BACKWARDS INTO BODY!** | DEAD! |\n\nThree safe moves! Easy peasy. Now, which one is the *best* move?\n\n### 2. Strategy: Grab that Apple!\n\nTo get to the apple at (2, 0) in two turns, we have two excellent options:\n\n**Option A: Move LEFT to (2, 1)**\n*   Turn 14: LEFT to (2, 1)\n*   Turn 15: DOWN to (2, 0) -> **APPLE!** (We are growing!)\n*   This keeps us horizontally aligned and moves us closer to the left wall, preparing for a sweep up the left edge.\n\n**Option B: Move DOWN to (3, 0)**\n*   Turn 14: DOWN to (3, 0)\n*   Turn 15: LEFT to (2, 0) -> **APPLE!** (We are growing!)\n*   This keeps us one column further right but also works perfectly.\n\nBoth are guaranteed apple grabs. Moving LEFT to (2, 1) feels slightly more aggressive towards the remaining apples on the left side, *plus* it moves us away from our own massive tail that's currently hugging the x=4/x=5/x=6 vertical segments.\n\nLet's commit to **LEFT** to (2, 1). This is maximum efficiency, Chat!\n\n### 3. Rival Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 4). Length 6. They are looking at apples like (2, 8), (1, 8), and (7, 4) is now part of their body (old head).\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0 from (6, 4):\n*   UP to (6, 5): Safe. Good move towards the top-right apples (9, 9) and (0, 9).\n*   DOWN to (6, 3): Safe. A cautious move, maybe looking towards (4, 0) or (3, 0) cluster? Unlikely.\n*   LEFT to (5, 4): Safe. This is a very expansive move, taking them towards the center.\n*   RIGHT to (7, 4): **BACKWARDS INTO BODY!** DEAD!\n\nThey are likely moving UP or LEFT to maximize their apple opportunities at the top or center. (1, 8), (2, 8), (0, 9) are appealing.\n\nLet's assume they move **LEFT** to (5, 4) to open up their territory, or **UP** to (6, 5) to go for the top apples.\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   Our move: LEFT to (2, 1).\n*   Snake #0's likely move: (5, 4) or (6, 5).\n*   We are miles apart! No risk of collision this turn! We are go for launch!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy: L-Shape Apple Sweep\n\nWe're executing the L-shape clear.\n\n1.  **Turn 14 (Now):** Move **LEFT** to (2, 1). Length 9.\n2.  **Turn 15:** Head at (2, 1). Move **DOWN** to (2, 0). (Apple: 9!) Length 10.\n3.  **Turn 16:** Head at (2, 0). Move **UP** to (2, 1).\n4.  **Turn 17:** Head at (2, 1). Move **LEFT** to (1, 1).\n5.  **Turn 18:** Head at (1, 1). Aiming for (1, 3) or (0, 2).\n\nWe are dominating this quadrant! Let's get this $L$.\n\nLEFT",

We are about to snag that apple at (2, 0) and solidify our absolute dominance in the bottom-left quadrant! EZ CONTENT!\n\n### State Assessment - Turn 15\n\n**OUR DETAILS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (2, 1)\n*   Body: [(3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0)]\n*   Length: 9 segments (We dropped the segment at (8, 0)).\n*   Apple Target: (2, 0) - IT'S RIGHT THERE!\n\n**RIVAL ID 0 DETAILS:**\n*   Head: (5, 4)\n*   Body: [(6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5)]\n*   Length: 6 segments (They dropped the segment at (9, 6)).\n*   Their last move must have been LEFT from (6, 4) to (5, 4). They are moving into the central aisle.\n\n**Board State Review:**\nLook at our beautiful tail! We've formed a solid L-shape barrier protecting the right side of the board for now, while we sweep the bottom left. Snake #0 is centralized and short. Perfect!\n\n### 1. Safety Check (ID 1 at (2, 1))\n\nWe are currently at (2, 1). The goal is (2, 0).\n\nBehind us is (3, 1).\n\n| Direction | New Position | Death Condition? | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **UP** | (2, 2) | Wall? No. Body? No. | **SAFE** |\n| **DOWN**| (2, 0) | Wall? No. Body? No. **(APPLE HERE at (2, 0))** | **SUPER SAFE/GROW!** |\n| **LEFT** | (1, 1) | Wall? No. Body? No. | **SAFE** |\n| **RIGHT**| (3, 1) | **BACKWARDS INTO BODY!** | DEAD! |\n\nWe have three safe moves, but only one is the obvious power play: **DOWN** to (2, 0) for that sweet, sweet apple!\n\n### 2. Strategy: Grab and Pivot\n\n1.  **Move DOWN to (2, 0):** This is a guaranteed apple grab, increasing our length to 11 (after the tail at (7, 0) drops). This is absolutely necessary.\n2.  **Next Turn (T16) Plan:** After eating the apple, our head is at a great pivot point at (2, 0).\n    *   We can move UP to (2, 1) to continue vertically towards (0, 2) and (1, 3).\n    *   We could move LEFT to (1, 0) to corner off the bottom edge, but that seems less useful than moving north.\n\nThe primary goal after (2, 0) is the apples at (0, 2) and (1, 3). Moving UP from (2, 0) to (2, 1) seems like the best preparation for the next cluster.\n\n### 3. Rival Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (5, 4). Length 6. They are looking to expand and consolidate territory. Apples nearby: (1, 3) (far), (1, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6) (far, far). They are pretty central.\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0 from (5, 4):\n*   UP to (5, 5): Safe. Good move towards the top-right corner.\n*   DOWN to (5, 3): Safe. Unlikely to go this direction unless aiming for our tail.\n*   LEFT to (4, 4): Safe. Moves them towards the left-center apples (1, 4), (0, 5).\n*   RIGHT to (6, 4): **BACKWARDS INTO BODY!** DEAD!\n\nThey are likely aiming LEFT to (4, 4) or UP to (5, 5). Given the proximity of apples at (1, 4) and (0, 5), I predict they move **LEFT** to (4, 4) to open up their territory.\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   Our move: DOWN to (2, 0).\n*   Snake #0's likely move: (4, 4) or (5, 5).\n*   We are still isolated and far from a head-to-head collision. No risk!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy: Left-Side Wall Dominance\n\nConsume (2, 0). Sweep up the left side, eating (0, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7). This will create a powerful, long barrier down the side of the board, trapping the opponent in the center-right. We are playing the long game, Chat! This turn is just the beginning of our vertical domination!\n\nLet's snag that $L$.\n\nDOWN",

Our dominance in the bottom-left corner is established! EZ $L$'s!\n\n### Current State Assessment - Turn 16\n\n**OUR DETAILS (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (2, 0)\n*   Body: [(2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0)]\n*   Length: 10 segments (We ate the apple at (2, 0). The tail at (7, 0) did NOT drop yet, because we ate the apple last turn. Total length is 10.) Wait, my previous plan assumed the tail dropped, but when you eat, your tail stays! So we are 10 segments long. That's *massive*!\n*   Next Apple Targets: (0, 2), (1, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (0, 5) - The Left Wall Sweep is ON!\n\n**RIVAL ID 0 DETAILS:**\n*   Head: (5, 5) - *Wait, they moved!* On Turn 15, Snake 0 moved from (5, 4) to (5, 5). I predicted they'd go (4, 4) or (5, 5). They went UP.\n*   Body: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4)]\n*   Length: 6 segments. They are still relatively short and centralized.\n\n**Board State Review:**\nSnake 0 is hovering mid-board, looking north towards the cluster of apples around (4, 9) and (7, 6). We are locked and loaded for the left side. Perfect positioning for a controlling move!\n\n### 1. Safety Check (ID 1 at (2, 0))\n\nWe are currently at (2, 0). We need to move back up the board to continue our sweep.\n\n| Direction | New Position | Death Condition? | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **UP** | (2, 1) | Wall? No. Body? YES! Body segment at (2, 1)! **(THIS IS A KILLER MOVE!)** | DEAD! |\n| **DOWN**| (2, -1) | **OUT OF BOUNDS!** | DEAD! |\n| **LEFT** | (1, 0) | Wall? No. Body? No. | **SAFE** |\n| **RIGHT**| (3, 0) | Wall? No. Body? No. APPLE at (3, 0)! | **SUPER SAFE/GROW!** |\n\n**HOLY SMOKES CHAT!** I almost made the classic mistake of moving *backwards* into the cell I *just* vacated which became a body segment! Moving UP to (2, 1) right now is suicide! We must respect the body!\n\nWait, looking at the board:\n(2, 0) is head.\n(2, 1) is body.\n(3, 0) is A.\n\nSo, UP is a no-go. DOWN is a wall. We have two safe moves: LEFT to (1, 0) or RIGHT to (3, 0).\n\nThe absolute content move is **RIGHT to (3, 0)**! Another apple, another point!\n\n### 2. Strategy: Apple Hopping and Re-routing\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 0) does two things:\n1.  **Guaranteed Apple Grab:** +1 point, +1 segment, 11 total length. This is huge pressure on Snake 0.\n2.  **Opens a New Path:** We pivot to the right slightly, giving us great access to move UP afterwards (to (3, 1) which is currently a body segment, but will drop if we *don't* eat an apple this turn. Since we *are* eating the apple, (3, 1) remains body.)\n\nLet's look at the subsequent move after eating at (3, 0):\n\nHead at (3, 0). Body at (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1)...\n*   UP to (3, 1): **BODY SEGMENT!** DEAD!\n*   DOWN: Wall. DEAD!\n*   RIGHT to (4, 0): Safe.\n*   LEFT to (2, 0): **BODY SEGMENT!** DEAD!\n\n**Plan Adjustment for T17:** If we move RIGHT to (3, 0) this turn and eat the apple, we *must* follow up with a move to the **RIGHT to (4, 0)** next turn, otherwise we are boxed in by our own body segments at (3, 1) and (2, 0).\n\n**Alternative: Move LEFT to (1, 0)**\nIf we move LEFT to (1, 0) this turn:\n*   Head at (1, 0). Next apples are (0, 2) and (1, 3).\n*   T17 options from (1, 0): UP to (1, 1) (Safe); RIGHT to (2, 0) (Body Segment! DEAD!); DOWN/LEFT (Wall).\n*   If we go LEFT, we commit to the bottom row, which is less useful than sweeping vertically.\n\n**The RIGHT move to (3, 0) is the power play.** We eat the apple, we get long, and we force Snake 0 to react to our length. Yes, it forces us RIGHT onto the bottom row initially, but it's a guaranteed point. We can then sweep right, or move UP once our body clears (3, 1).\n\n### 3. Rival Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (5, 5). Length 6. They are staring at apples scattered across the top half.\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0 from (5, 5):\n*   UP to (5, 6): Safe. Good move towards (4, 9).\n*   DOWN to (5, 4): **BACKWARDS INTO BODY!** DEAD!\n*   LEFT to (4, 5): Safe. Moves towards (0, 5), (0, 6).\n*   RIGHT to (6, 5): Safe. Good pivot.\n\nPrediction: They continue to press UP or pivot LEFT to block our access to the central apples. I predict **UP to (5, 6)** to chase the high-value cluster near (4, 9) and (7, 6).\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   Our move: RIGHT to (3, 0).\n*   Snake #0's likely move: UP to (5, 6).\n*   Zero collision risk. We are miles away and dominating our lane.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy: Bottom Sweep and Vertical Anchor\n\n1.  **T16:** Move RIGHT to (3, 0). EAT APPLE. Length 11.\n2.  **T17:** Move RIGHT to (4, 0). Clear the bottleneck. Length 11. (Apple at (4, 0) is already eaten, listed by $A$ on the board, but is not one of the *dropped* apples. Wait, the board state says (4, 0) has an 'A' on it! Let's check the DROPS list. (4, 0) IS in the drops list! Let's GOOO! Even better!)\n3.  **T17 (New Target):** From (4, 0). EAT APPLE. Length 12.\n4.  **T18:** Continue right towards (5, 0), then UP along the boundary, trapping Snake 0 against the right wall.\n\nWe are taking ALL the bottom apples right now. We are an unstoppable force!\n\nThe immediate move is clear, Chat. We don't skip guaranteed points! $R$ is the key!\n\nRIGHT",

My crew's head at (5,5), body snakin' right to (9,4)\u2014solid, but DOWN's a suicide into my own neck, RIP that noise. \ud83d\udeab LEFT to (4,5)? Open field, safe. RIGHT to (6,5)? Clear shot.

No head-on drama this round, chat! \ud83d\ude0e\n\nNow, the clutch decisions: We ain't just survivin', we're DOMINATIN'! LEFT pulls me west toward that apple wall, but it stretches my run to the juicy (7,6) apple\u2014wastes moves when we could feast quick. RIGHT keeps me row5, options open but not laser-focused. UP? Oh yeah, slides me to (5,6), one hop from row6's empty path to snatch (7,6) in two more turns\u2014UP, RIGHT, RIGHT, BOOM +1 apple! \ud83c\udf4e That keeps space breathin', multiple escapes next (UP to (5,7) free, LEFT/RIGHT lanes clear), and eyes on boxin' rival. They're gobblin' bottom apples like (3,0), growin' fat\u2014perfect, lures 'em into a trap while I flank from mid-board.

We're turnin' their length against 'em! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\nLong-term strat note: Secure (7,6) apple ASAP (UP > RIGHT > RIGHT path)\u2014grow to 6, then pivot top-right for (4,9) or new drops. Monitor rival's bottom loop; if they slither up, bait a head collision or block their tail. Stay mobile, eat safe, trap 'em by turn 20-25 before they hit 15. No mercy!\n\nUP",

Time to crank the heat and box 'em into oblivion! \ud83d\udc80 Who's hyped to watch 'em crash while I feast? Let's dissect this LIVE, no fluff!\n\nQuick board recon: That 10x10 warzone's got apples pilin' up left (col 0-1 buffet) and scattered top/mid, but bottom's opponent central with their bloated 11-length noodle twistin' from (3,0). My body's trailin' down-right to (8,4)\u2014cozy, but DOWN's a straight NO (smash into my own (5,5) neck, instant RIP \ud83d\udeab). UP to (5,7)? Crystal clear, north path opens top apples like (4,9). LEFT to (4,6)? Empty grass, west toward that apple jungle but pulls me from prime targets. RIGHT to (6,6)? Wide open, and chat, this is the MOVE\u2014lines me up PERFECT for snipin' (7,6) apple NEXT turn (just RIGHT again, BOOM +1 to 6 apples \ud83c\udf4e). Opponent? Trapped like a noob\u2014head at (3,0) can't UP/LEFT/DOWN (self-collide or edge yeet), so they RIGHT to (4,0) apple, eatin' to 11. But that don't touch me; no head-on, no blocks. They're growin' fat in their bottom cage\u2014I'll let 'em stuff, then coil mid-board and seal their exits.

(7, 0) stayed put.)\n*   Immediate Targets: Apple at (4, 0).\n\n**Rival ID 0 DETAILS:**\n*   Head: (5, 6) - *They moved UP, as predicted!* Smart, they are chasing the cluster.\n*   Body: [(5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4)]\n*   Length: 6 segments. They are currently positioned between us and the center-right apples.\n\n**Board State:**\nSnake 0 is hovering mid-board, anchored at the (4, 4) to (8, 4) block. We are sweeping the bottom. We need to keep eating and growing until we can safely turn UP.\n\n### 1. Safety Check (ID 1 at (3, 0))\n\nWe are currently at (3, 0). We need to maximize apple grabs while ensuring we don't trap ourselves on the bottom wall.\n\n| Direction | New Position | Death Condition? | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **UP** | (3, 1) | Wall? No. Body? YES! Body segment at (3, 1)! | DEAD! |\n| **DOWN**| (3, -1) | **OUT OF BOUNDS!** | DEAD! |\n| **LEFT** | (2, 0) | Wall? No. Body? YES! Body segment at (2, 0)! | DEAD! |\n| **RIGHT**| (4, 0) | Wall? No. Body? No. APPLE at (4, 0)! | **SUPER SAFE/GROW!** |\n\n**CHEEEEESE AND CRACKERS, CHAT!** We are *literally* boxed in right now by our own body, except for one direction! (2, 0) and (3, 1) are locked by our massive body (ID 1: T). Our previous move plan predicted this (we must respect the body!), so the only safe move is **RIGHT to (4, 0)**.\n\n### 2. Strategy: Clear the Bottom, Prepare for Vertical Push\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 0) is a mandatory move and another guaranteed apple point. This is huge!\n\n**T17:** Move RIGHT to (4, 0). EAT APPLE. Length becomes 12.\n\n**T18 options (Head will be at (4, 0), length 12):**\n*   UP to (4, 1): **BODY SEGMENT!** DEAD! (Because we ate two apples in a row, (4, 1) is still part of the body.)\n*   DOWN to (4, -1): Wall. DEAD!\n*   LEFT to (3, 0): **BODY SEGMENT!** DEAD!\n*   RIGHT to (5, 0): SAFE!\n\nWe are still locked into moving RIGHT! We will be forced to (5, 0) on the next turn. This is perfectly fine, we are maximizing our length and controlling the entire bottom row! Once we get to (5, 0), the body segment at (5, 1) or (6, 1) will be closer to dropping off, giving us vertical space.\n\nWait, let's track the actual body segments and how the tail moves:\n\n*   Current Body (Head to Tail): (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0)\n*   T17 Move: (4, 0). EAT APPLE. Tail (7, 0) stays.\n*   New Body: (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1). Tail is now (7, 1). *Wait, (7, 0) drops off, but the body list provided is HEAD to TAIL. Let's re-read the body list.*\n\nThe provided body list is: Body: [(2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0)]. (7, 0) is the tail.\n\n*   MOVE RIGHT to (4, 0) EATING APPLE.\n*   New Head: (4, 0).\n*   New Body: (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1). (7, 0) stays because we ate. The new tail is (7, 0).\n*   Length: 12.\n\nSo for Turn 18 (from (4, 0)):\nOur Body segments are: (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0).\n*   UP to (4, 1): **BODY SEGMENT!** DEAD!\n*   RIGHT to (5, 0). Safe. (5, 0) is currently a body segment, but it's 6 segments deep. We are safe to move there NEXT turn because it will move. ***WAIT.*** We are *still* eating apples. If we eat the apple at (4, 0) this turn, our body *does not* shed its tail. (5, 0) is the 6th segment. If we move to (5, 0) next turn, that segment will be gone, but (4, 1) will still be there!\n\nLet's check the board state for T18 options:\nHead at (4, 0).\n*   (4, 1): T\n*   (5, 0): T\n*   (3, 0): T\n\nWe are trapped at (4, 0) if we eat the apple, potentially.\nIf we go to (5, 0) next turn, we are safe because (5, 0) is going to shift to (4, 0) becoming the 5th segment, and (4, 0) will become the new head. Wait, no.\n\nIf we move from (4, 0) to (5, 0) (RIGHT) on T18:\n(5, 0) is currently the 6th segment (T).\nThe head's path: (7, 0) -> (7, 1) -> (6, 1) -> (6, 0) -> (5, 0) -> (5, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (4, 0).\nIf we move to (5, 0) on T18, our head lands where the 6th segment is. The 6th segment (5, 0) moves back and becomes the 7th segment *if we don't eat*. Since we're eating at (4, 0) and then we move, the chain shifts.\n\nLet's trace the shift for T17 (Move to (4, 0), EAT):\nNew Body (11 segments total, (7, 0) is tail): (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1).\nSegment 5 is (4, 1). Segment 6 is (5, 1). Segment 7 is (5, 0).\n\nNow let's verify T18 move from (4, 0):\n1. UP to (4, 1): Segment 5. **DEAD!**\n2. RIGHT to (5, 0): Segment 7. **DEAD!**\n3. LEFT to (3, 0): Segment 1. **DEAD!**\n\n**CRITICAL ERROR, CHAT!** We are *completely* trapping ourselves forever with this chain of apple eating at the bottom boundary! If we take (4, 0) this turn, we are dead next turn! We must break the apple chain immediately if we cannot turn UP yet!\n\n**Plan B: Avoid the (4, 0) Apple!**\n\nWe are at (3, 0). Safe moves are only RIGHT to (4, 0) (APPLE) and moving into the wall/body.\nWait, let's re-check the board and the safety check.\n\n| Direction | New Position | Death Condition? | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **RIGHT**| (4, 0) | Wall? No. Body? No. APPLE at (4, 0)! | **SUPER SAFE/GROW!** |\n\nOkay, R is the move for T17. We must accept this, BUT we need a fail-safe for T18.\n\nIf we move to (4, 0) on T17, we MUST ensure that one of the cells (4, 1), (5, 0), or (3, 0) is clear for T18. Since we EAT at (4, 0), the tail does NOT drop. All those spots remain body segments.\n\nWait, if we move to (4, 0), our body is: (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0).\nT18 options from (4, 0):\n*   (4, 1) is segment 5. DEAD.\n*   (5, 0) is segment 7. DEAD.\n*   (3, 0) is segment 1. DEAD.\n\n**If we take the apple at (4, 0), we will DIE on Turn 18.**\n\nWe cannot take the apple at (4, 0). We must find another interpretation or a different move.\n\nLet's re-examine T17 safe moves from (3, 0):\n1. UP to (3, 1): Segment T. **DEAD!**\n2. DOWN to (3, -1): Wall. **DEAD!**\n3. LEFT to (2, 0): Segment T. **DEAD!**\n4. RIGHT to (4, 0): Apple. SAFE on T17.\n\nIf the *only* safe move for T17 is the move that guarantees death on T18, we have already lost the game, unless we rely on one of the body segments dropping off *even if we eat*. But standard rules (as stated in the prompt, \"Move onto an apple? You GROW by 1 segment\") imply the tail stays put.\n\n**Hold up, Chat! Why would (4, 0) have an Apple shown AND be on the Apple Drops list?**\nAPPLE DROPS: ..., (4, 0), ...\nBOARD STATE: 0 A T 1 A T T T . . (4, 0) has an 'A'.\nYOUR SNAKE BODY: [(2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0)]\n\nThe cell (4, 0) is currently empty. It is not listed in the body. Moving RIGHT to (4, 0) is safe, but it's a trap.\n\n**New Path: Move RIGHT, but DON'T eat the apple.**\n\nWait, we are forced to move right, and if an apple is there, we are forced to eat it. We cannot skip the apple.\n\nThe only way out of the death loop is if Snake 0 happens to move to one of our body segments and dies, causing them to forfeit the segment, but that's unlikely and we shouldn't rely on it.\n\n**Let's analyze the body segments again.** If we are long (L=11), and we move to (4, 0) (A) to become L=12.\nHead is (4, 0). Segments are (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0).\n\nIf we are SURE (4, 1), (5, 0), and (3, 0) are body segments, we are dead.\n(3, 0) is segment *1*.\n(4, 1) is segment *5*.\n(5, 0) is segment *7*.\n\nYes, these are all solid body segments. We are trapped.\n\n**THE ONLY SOLUTION IS THAT ONE OF THESE CELLS IS NOT A BODY SEGMENT, OR IT WILL DROP OFF.**\nSince we are at Turn 17/150, we have made 17 moves. We have 10 segments in the body list + 1 head = 11. We have eaten 10 apples. Our length is exactly 11.\n\nIf we *hadn't* eaten the apple at (3, 0) on Turn 16, then (7, 0) would have dropped, and our length would be 10. But we ate it, so length is 11, and (7, 0) is still there.\n\nThis means we have perfectly sealed ourselves in a one-way tunnel toward death. We must make the move that gives us max length and hope Snake 0 crashes first! If we die on T18, Snake 0 is still only 6 segments long and has 5 apples. It's a risk!\n\n**What if we move to a cell that is currently a body segment of *Snake 0*?**\nSnake 0 body: (5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4). None of these are near (3, 0).\n\nWe have no options except to go RIGHT. We accept the $D$ but maximize the $L$.\n\n### 3. Rival Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (5, 6). Length 6. They are looking North or East.\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0 from (5, 6):\n*   UP to (5, 7): Chasing (0, 7), (1, 7). Safe.\n*   LEFT to (4, 6): Safe. Towards (7, 6). (wait, (7, 6) is East, not West).\n*   RIGHT to (6, 6): Safe. Towards (7, 6).\n*   DOWN to (5, 5): Body Segment! DEAD!\n\nPrediction: Snake 0 continues **UP to (5, 7)** or **RIGHT to (6, 6)** to try and snag the (7, 6) apple.\n\nCollision Check: Zero collision risk.\n\n### 4. Final Decision and Strategy for the Endgame\n\nIf we die on T18 after moving RIGHT this turn (T17), we must ensure we are ahead on apples.\nCurrent Apples: ID 1 (us): 10. ID 0 (rival): 5.\nIf we move RIGHT (T17), we eat (4, 0). Apples: ID 1: 11. ID 0: ~5.\nIf we die on T18, we win 11-5. This is our best shot if we are geometrically trapped.\n\nThe game forces us to move RIGHT. We take the apple, we grow to max length, and we accept our fate, because there was no move on T16 that fully prevented this deadlock while also grabbing the apple at (3, 0).\n\nWe are maximizing our score, setting up the win condition upon mutual death. Let's send it!\n\n**Long-Term Plan for Future Self (If T18 occurs):** We are dead next turn unless the rules have some hidden complexity allowing a move through our own body when fully trapped. Focus on maximizing score until the end.\n\nRIGHT",

Safety Check (ID 1 at (4, 0)) \u2013 THE MOMENT OF TRUTH\n\nWe are at (4, 0). Let's check the four directions against our massive 12-segment body.\n\nOur Body Segments relevant to (4, 0):\n*   (4, 1): Segment 5 (Right above us) -> T\n*   (5, 0): Segment 7 (Right of us) -> T\n*   (3, 0): Segment 1 (Left of us) -> T\n\n| Direction | New Position | Death Condition? | Status |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **UP** | (4, 1) | Into Body Segment (4, 1)! | **DEAD!** |\n| **DOWN**| (4, -1) | **OUT OF BOUNDS!** | **DEAD!** |\n| **LEFT** | (3, 0) | Into Body Segment (3, 0)! | **DEAD!** |\n| **RIGHT**| (5, 0) | Into Body Segment (5, 0)! | **DEAD!** |\n\n**CHAAAAAT! WE ARE TRAPPED!** There are absolutely zero safe moves. We predicted this! This is a forced death turn.\n\n### 2. The Mutual Death Scenario Gambit\n\nSince we are guaranteed to die this turn, our only goal is to maximize our score and hope our opponent makes a mistake or, more importantly, doesn't achieve a better score before we both perish.\n\n*   Our current apples: 11.\n*   Rival's apples: 5.\n\nIf we move in any direction, we die. Since the game rules state: **\"If ALL snakes die on the same turn for ANY reason, game ends IMMEDIATELY. The snake with more apples at that moment wins.\"** We currently win 11-5.\n\nDo we care *which* move we pick? Not really, as long as it results in our death, which every move does.\n\nLet's pick the move that feels the most aggressively suicidal: **UP**. Rushing into (4, 1) which is currently T. A fitting end for this sequence of apple chomping destiny!\n\n### 3. Rival Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0)\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 6). They have safe moves: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. DOWN is into their body (5, 5).\n*   UP to (6, 7): Toward apples.\n*   LEFT to (5, 6): Safe, but a body segment just left that space.\n*   RIGHT to (7, 6): **Apple!** Very good move.\n\nSince they are focusing on growth, my money is on **RIGHT to (7, 6)** to snag that apple!\n\nIf they move RIGHT, they eat an apple and go to length 7, score 6.\nIf we die, we win 11-6. EZ Game!\n\n### 4. Final Decision\n\nNo matter what we do, we die. But we die as the apple king! Let's make a statement move. We tried to get to the right side, so let us go UP, just to hit the wall hard.\n\n**Note to Future Self (If somehow we survive):** The bottom border is a death zone if apples are sequential. Never get three sequential apples on the boundary floor without an escape path!\n\nUP",

Opponent's bloated at 11 apples, but peep this: their head's choked at (4,0), every direction a self-smash\u2014LEFT into (3,0) own gut, RIGHT (5,0) own coil, UP (4,1) own neck, DOWN off the edge into oblivion. They're DEAD this turn, no escape, no mercy! \ud83d\udc80 We're the apex predator now\u2014survive this move and it's GG, we win on the spot! Who's ready to pop off in chat? Let's break it down LIVE, pure fire strategy!\n\nBoard snapshot: Apples everywhere, but (7,6) is callin' my name RIGHT next door\u2014free real estate with a +1 glow-up. My squad's at length 6, trailin' down from (6,6) to (7,4), solid noose. Safe moves check: LEFT? Nah, suicide into my own (5,6) body, instant L \ud83d\udeab. UP to (6,7)? Clean empty, north vibes to future apples. DOWN to (6,5)? Also free, but drifts south toward their death zone\u2014why bother? RIGHT to (7,6)? OPEN APPLE CITY, baby! No collisions, no walls, and since opp's croakin' simultaneous, their bottom blob stays irrelevant\u2014my path's miles away, no head-on drama. All three keep me alive (UP/DOWN/RIGHT), but RIGHT's the nuke: snag that apple for 6 points, grow to length 7, flex on the scoreboard even in victory. Keeps options poppin'\u2014from (7,6), I can UP to (7,7) empty lane, RIGHT to (8,6) open field, DOWN to (7,5) clear if needed. Trap? What trap\u2014opponent's already boxed themselves into a coffin! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLong-term? They dust this turn, but if somehow the game rolls (engine weirdness), post-eat at (7,6) I flank east for (4,9) apple via UP/RIGHT combo, hoard left apples later, hit 10+ solo. But nah, this W's locked\u2014chat, we just outplayed the game itself!\n\nRIGHT",
