There is an apple at (3, 9) and a cluster of apples on the left edge at (0, 0), (0, 1), and (0, 4).\n\n1.  **UP** moves me to (2, 2).

Snake #1 could potentially move to (1, 0), threatening that area, but it's safe for now.\n3.  **LEFT** moves me to (1, 1). This is currently occupied by Snake #1. Since all snakes move simultaneously, if Snake #1 moves out of (1, 1), I won't collide with its body, but I would highly likely face a head-on collision or move into its path if it moves towards me. If I move LEFT, and it moves RIGHT, we collide at (1.5, 1) or essentially crash. If it stays still (not possible) or moves elsewhere, I take its previous spot. However, moving toward an enemy head is risky.\n4.  **RIGHT** moves me to (3, 1). This is safe and moves me away from the enemy.\n\nStrategic considerations:\nSnake #1 is at (1, 1) and will likely try to go for the apples at (0, 0), (0, 1), or (0, 4). If I move UP or RIGHT, I create space. If I move LEFT I'm looking for a fight/collision.\nThe most immediate apples are at (0, 1) and (0, 0). However, Snake #1 is closer to them. The apple at (6, 8) and (3, 9) are further away.\n\nI will move UP to maintain flexibility and avoid a direct 50/50 collision at (1,1) or (2,1).\n\nPlan: Move UP to (2, 2), then evaluate if I can contest the apple at (0, 4) or if I should head towards the apples at (6, 8) or (3, 9).

Snake #1's possible moves are UP to (4, 4) (my current head position), DOWN to (4, 2) (invalid/backwards), LEFT to (3, 3), or RIGHT to (5, 3). \nIf I move RIGHT and they move RIGHT, I am at (5, 4) and they are at (5, 3).\nIf I move RIGHT and they move UP, I am at (5, 4) and they are at (4, 4).\nMoving RIGHT is safe this turn and gains a point.\n\nLong-term plan:\nSecure the apple at (5, 4) by moving RIGHT. After that, the nearest apples are at (7, 1) or the group at the top (3, 9) and (4, 9). Since Snake #1 is nearby (4, 3), I should secure (5, 4) and then potentially move UP or further RIGHT to avoid being cut off against the bottom wall.\n\nRIGHT",

This is moving directly into your own body (backward move).\n2. **DOWN**: (3, 6). **Safe**. This moves you toward the apple at (4, 3) and (7, 1).\n3. **LEFT**: (2, 7). **Safe and Actionable**.

We would be adjacent, but since it's a simultaneous turn, I would already be at (2, 7). \n    - Snake #1's possible moves from (1, 8): UP (1, 9), DOWN (1, 7), RIGHT (2, 8). \n    - If I move LEFT to (2, 7) and Snake #1 moves DOWN to (1, 7), we are safe (no collision). If it moves RIGHT to (2, 8), it is one step above me.\n- **Grabbing Apples**: The apple at (2, 7) is only one tile away. Grabbing it increases my score to 7 and grows my body.\n\n### Long-term Plan\n1. Move LEFT to take the apple at (2, 7).\n2. Assess Snake #1\u2019s position. If it stays in the top-left, I will pivot DOWN or RIGHT towards the apples at (4, 3) or (7, 7) to avoid getting pinned against the left wall.\n3. Keep an eye on the apple at (0, 0); since Snake #1 is nearby, I may let them have it if it means avoiding a trap.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMoving LEFT to (2, 7) to collect the immediate apple. This is safe as Snake #1 is at (1, 8). Even if Snake #1 moves DOWN to (1, 7), we do not collide. This move increases my lead and keeps me away from my own long tail currently wrapping around the top right.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Moving UP to (2, 8) moves me closer to the top wall and my own tail.\n\n### Long-term Plan\nSnake #1 is constrained and will likely move DOWN. I will move DOWN to (2, 6) to stay flexible. This avoids getting pinched against the top wall and positions me to grab the apples in the center/bottom of the board. I will prioritize the apple at (6, 6) or (4, 3) next.\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT deadly (lands on enemy new neck regardless of their UP/DOWN/LEFT); UP backwards into own neck death. No head-on risks (enemy can't reach my safe spots; if they LEFT to (1,7), they hit my new neck and die). Enemy likely DOWN to (2,6) targeting (4,3) t29 eat (optimal: t25 RIGHT (3,6), t26 RIGHT (4,6), t27-29 DOWN x3 to (4,3); clears south path without north detour risks). Less likely UP (2,8) for awkward north loop to (7,7) (blocked by own body/turn radius); LEFT suicide. DOWN best: follows plan, uncontested col1 south (tail frees col0 row7 immediately), positions for t30 LEFT adjust at row1 avoiding post-eat row0 block at col1 (original t30 (1,0) flaw noted\u2014deviate to enter col0 at (0,1) t30 for clean row0 east post-eat). Secures (0,0) t31 before enemy pivot (even if they eat (4,3) t29 length9, east/south flank limits intercept; col2 down+left arrives t33 post-me). Post-t31 length5, row0 east unblocked (body pulls into row0 by t35). Avoids early LEFT diversion (less progress, exposes col0 if enemy flanks west unlikely).  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN**  \nT24: DOWN (1,6). T25-29: DOWN x5 col1 to (1,1) t29 (col1 clear; tail pulls north freeing space). T30: LEFT (0,1) (empty, preps col0 entry without blocking row0 col1 later). T31: DOWN (0,0) eat4/length5 (apple safe). T32-38: RIGHT x7 row0 to (7,0) t38 (row0 cols1-7 clear; body trails col0/1 pulling straight by t35). T39: UP (7,1) eat5/length6 (apple likely free vs enemy south). T40+: From (7,1), target (4,3) if uneaten via LEFT row1 to (4,1) t43, UP x2 to (4,3) t45 (contest if enemy post-(4,3) lingers col4); else (6,6) via RIGHT row1 to (6,1) UP x5 t50 or north loop if blocked. If enemy UP north took (7,7) t? (unlikely, slow), unopposed south then flank (6,6) row1/ col6. Shadow enemy: if DOWN to (4,3) t29 then east to (7,1)/(6,6), intercept row0/1 east post-t39; if DOWN then west to (0,0), block col1/row0 pre-t31 pivot (but they lose turn radius).

The apple at (7, 7) is also reasonably close (3 steps from (5, 6)).\n- **Safety**: Moving RIGHT keeps you in the center-right area, which is currently less congested. Snake #1 is confined to the left side (x=1). By moving RIGHT, you maintain a healthy buffer.\n- **Body Management**: Your tail is at (4, 9). Moving RIGHT to (5, 6) keeps you away from your own winding body segments at (2, 7)-(3, 7)-(3, 8)-(3, 9).\n\n### Long-term Plan\nI will target (6, 6) first, then assess the proximity to (7, 7). Snake #1 is currently disconnected from these apples. After securing the top-right apples, I will loop back down toward the bottom-right for (7, 1) and (4, 3), ensuring I don't get trapped against the right wall.\n\nRIGHT",

This will give you plenty of room to grow without getting tangled in your own body, which is currently clustered in the middle (x=2 to x=6).\n\n### Long-term Plan\nI will take the apple at (7, 7) this turn. From there, I'll assess whether to go for (9, 8) or navigate down the right side to get (7, 1).

This keeps you away from your own body trail which currently occupies the middle-top area.\n\n### Long-term Plan\nI am currently constricted and have only one valid move. I will move RIGHT to (8, 9) and proceed to (9, 9). From there, I will descend to (9, 8) to eat the apple. Once clear of the top-right corner, I will head toward the clusters at (7, 1) and (7, 0).\n\nRIGHT",

This might become a tight space later.\n    - If I move **DOWN** to (9, 7), I stay on the edge.

Moves directly back into the body/neck.\n2. **DOWN**: (9, 4). **Safe**. Continues down the right edge.\n3. **LEFT**: (8, 5). **Safe**. Moves towards apple (7, 5) and creates interior space.\n4. **RIGHT**: (10, 5). **Invalid**. Off the board.\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n- **Apple Targets**: \n    - The nearest apple is (7, 5). From (8, 5), I am only 1 step away.\n    - Snake #1 is at (7, 2). They could potentially reach apple (7, 3) in 1 step or move towards (7, 5). \n    - My head at (9, 5) is 2 steps away from apple (7, 5).\n- **Collision Risk**: If I move LEFT to (8, 5), and Snake #1 moves UP twice, we could contest (7, 5). However, Snake #1 is currently at (7, 2). To hit me at (8, 5) next turn, they would need to be at (8, 4) or (7, 5), which they cannot reach in one turn.\n- **Pathing**: Moving LEFT now is more efficient for apple collection than moving DOWN to (9, 4) and then trying to turn back in.\n\n### Long-term Plan\nMove LEFT toward (8, 5) to secure the apple at (7, 5). This positions me to either challenge Snake #1 for the apples at (7, 3) and (4, 3) or circle back if the area becomes too congested. My tail is currently clearing out of the top-right corner, so I have plenty of space behind me.\n\nLEFT",

However, Snake #1 is at (7, 3). If they move UP twice, they could be at (7, 5) on Turn 44. More importantly, if they move UP this turn to (7, 4), they are only 1 step away from (7, 5).

Moving toward apple (7, 3), but Snake #1 is already at (7, 3).\n4. **RIGHT**: (9, 5). **Invalid**. This is my neck.\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n- **Apple (7, 5)**: I am at (8, 5). Moving LEFT takes this apple immediately.\n- **Snake #1's Position**: Their head is at (7, 3). They have options to move toward (4, 3), (7, 0), or (7, 4). If I move to (7, 5), I am at a higher Y-coordinate than them.\n- **Space**: Taking (7, 5) is the most efficient move. It secures a point and keeps me away from the wall. My body is currently occupying the right and top edges, so moving toward the center-left is good for long-term navigation.\n- **Potential Collision**: If I move LEFT to (7, 5), and Snake #1 moves UP to (7, 4), we will be adjacent. They cannot kill me next turn via head-on collision at (7, 5) because they are 2 steps away.\n\n### Long-term Plan\nCapture the apple at (7, 5) by moving LEFT. After that, assess the position of Snake #1. If they move towards (4, 3), I can follow or head toward (0, 6) or (0, 4). I have a significant lead (11 vs 7), so playing safely while maintaining board presence is key.\n\nLEFT",

This moves into open space and maintains distance from Snake #1.\n2. **UP**: (7, 6). **Safe**. This moves into open space.\n3. **DOWN**: (7, 4). **Risky**. Snake #1 is at (6, 3). If they move UP to (6, 4) and I move DOWN to (7, 4), we will be adjacent. If they move RIGHT to (7, 3) (impossible as it's their neck) or UP then RIGHT, they could contest space. More importantly, (7, 4) is very close to their head.\n4. **RIGHT**: (8, 5). **Invalid**. This is my neck.\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n- **Nearby Apples**: (5, 4) and (4, 3) are the closest apples. (5, 4) is 3 steps away from me via (6, 5) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 4). Snake #1 is at (6, 3), only 2 steps away from (5, 4) via (6, 4) -> (5, 4).\n- **Snake #1's Behavior**: They are currently positioned mid-board. Moving towards the left side (0, 4) and (0, 6) might be safer long-term than contesting (5, 4) directly, as they are closer to the bottom-middle apples.\n- **Space Management**: My body is currently wrapped around the top-right corner. I should move towards the center-left where there is more open space and several apples.\n\n### Long-term Plan\nMove **LEFT** to (6, 5). This positions me to either contested the apple at (5, 4) or continue towards the cluster on the far left (0, 4 and 0, 6). By moving LEFT, I avoid a potential head-to-head confrontation at (7, 4) and keep my options open for navigating the middle of the board.\n\nLEFT",

DOWN leads toward (7,0) apple but risks tight space near own body vertical stack (e.g., next DOWN hits (6,1) own) and enemy territory; avoid for now. UP or LEFT both position toward nearby apples at (5,4) and (4,3), both Manhattan distance 2. Enemy at (7,5) can't reach either in 1-2 turns (distances 3+), no head-on risk this turn. Prioritize LEFT: shorter path to clear row 3, enables flexible follow-ups to eat both local apples quickly without detour, grows to len10/apples9 by t46, then surges west to (0,4)/(0,6). UP also viable but leaves row 3 path slightly less direct for (4,3). Enemy likely DOWN/LEFT to probe south/west (e.g., toward (7,0) or flank), but my left move vacates col6-7 partially (tail shifts east initially), distant from its coil (Manhattan 5+ post-move).

My best bet for apples are (0, 6) and (0, 4) or looping around to (7, 0).\n- **Snake #1's Move**: Snake #1 is likely to move LEFT towards (4, 4) or RIGHT towards (6, 4) to avoid me, or DOWN towards (5, 3) (invalid). They are likely heading for the clusters at (4, 3) or (1, 3).\n\n### Strategy\nMoving **UP** creates distance between me and Snake #1, preventing any accidental head-on collision this turn. It also positions me to sweep across the top-left quadrant for the apples at (0, 6) and (0, 4). Moving LEFT is also viable, but UP offers more expansion room away from the enemy's current path.\n\n**Plan**: Move UP to (5, 6) to secure space, then head LEFT toward (0, 6).\n\nUP",

Moves directly toward the apple at (0, 6). This is the shortest path and keeps me far from the enemy.\n2. **UP (3, 7)**: **Safe**. Moves into open space, but away from the apple at (0, 6).\n3. **DOWN (3, 5)**: **Safe**. Moves closer to the board center. Note that Snake #1 is at (3, 3). If I move to (3, 5) and they move UP to (3, 4), we will be one cell apart.\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n- **Food Targeting**: The apple at (0, 6) is very accessible. After that, (0, 4) is a logical next step.\n- **Enemy Movement**: Snake #1 is currently tangled near the center. They will likely go for the apple at (1, 3) or (6, 4). By heading towards the left wall, I stay away from their likely path and secure the food in the top-left quadrant.\n- **Space Management**: My body is currently occupying a significant portion of the right side and middle-right. Moving left gives me more room to maneuver.\n\n### Plan\nMove LEFT to (2, 6) to continue toward the apple at (0, 6). Following that, I will head down to (0, 6) and then decide between (0, 4) or (1, 3) depending on Snake #1's position.\n\nLEFT",

Their most likely targets are (1, 3) or (6, 4).\n- **Space Management**: The board's middle is somewhat congested by Snake #1 and my own mid-section. Sticking to the perimeter (the left wall) is a safe way to collect points while waiting for my tail at (9, 9) to clear out the top-right area.\n\n### Plan\nMove LEFT to (1, 6) to reach the apple at (0, 6). Then continue to (0, 6) and pivot down toward the apple at (0, 4). This path keeps me away from the enemy while securing two relatively uncontested apples.\n\nLEFT",

After moving to (0, 6), I will likely move DOWN twice to (0, 4).\n- **Enemy Contact**: Snake #1 is at (1, 3). If I move toward (0, 4), we will be in close proximity. However, because my body is currently occupying the (2,6) to (5,6) and (5,5) to (9,5) corridor, I am effectively sectioning off the top-left area for myself. \n- **Collision Risk**: If I move to (0, 6) and Snake #1 moves to (1, 4), we are safe. If I then move to (0, 5) and they move to (0, 4), I need to be careful of a head-on collision at (0, 4).\n\n### Plan\nMove LEFT to (0, 6) to eat the apple. On the next turn, assess Snake #1's position to safely approach the apple at (0, 4). My high apple count gives me a cushion, but I must maintain the lead.\n\nLEFT",

This moves me closer to the apple at (0, 4). However, the enemy snake (Snake #1) is at (1, 4) and is likely to go for the same apple at (0, 4). If I move to (0, 5) and they move to (0, 4), I cannot capture it next turn without risking a head-on collision at (0, 4).\n2. **UP (0, 7)**: **Safe**. Moves into open space along the left wall. This is a conservative move that maintains positioning while waiting to see where the enemy snake moves.\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n- **Apple at (0, 4)**: Snake #1 is only 1 move away from this apple. I am 2 moves away. They will likely reach it first.\n- **Apple at (6, 8)**: This apple is relatively close to me. After moving UP to (0, 7) and then (0, 8), I can move across the top toward (6, 8).\n- **Enclosure**: My current body forms a long horizontal line at Y=6 and Y=5. I have mostly partitioned the board. Snake #1 is currently trapped below my main body segments.\n\n### Plan\nI will move **DOWN** to (0, 5). While Snake #1 will likely get the apple at (0, 4) this turn, moving DOWN keeps me closer to the action and allows me to either pressure them or pivot toward the center. If they take (0, 4), I will then pivot back UP or RIGHT to avoid getting pinned against the wall. Alternatively, if they move RIGHT toward (2, 4), I might have a path to (0, 4). \n\n*Self-correction*: If I move DOWN to (0, 5), and they move LEFT to (0, 4), our heads will be diagonally adjacent. This is safe, but I must be careful not to move into (0, 4) on the turn after if they are already there.\n\nDOWN",

This move takes me away from the wall and provides more room to maneuver. It also puts me in a position to potentially intercept Snake #1 if they try to move further right or down.\n2. **DOWN (0, 4)**: **Dangerous**. Snake #1 is currently at (0, 4). If they stay still (not possible) or move anywhere else, I would hit their body. If they move UP to (0, 5) while I move DOWN to (0, 4), we have a head-on collision. If they move DOWN to (0, 3) and I move to (0, 4), I would be entering the spot their head just occupied, which is safe, but puts me in a very cramped vertical space.\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n- **Space Management**: I have 13 segments and am quite long. My body currently blocks the middle of the board (Y=5 and Y=6). \n- **Apple Targets**: The nearest apples represent a trek. (1, 5) is actually an apple, which is wonderful! I didn't see (1, 5) in my head position check, but the prompt lists it. Looking at coordinates: Head (0, 5), move RIGHT to (1, 5). \n- **The Apple at (1, 5)**: This is the safest and most immediate reward. By moving RIGHT, I grab an apple and maintain distance from the enemy head.\n\n### Plan\nMove **RIGHT** to capture the apple at (1, 5). This increases my lead and keeps me away from the collision risk at (0, 4). After taking (1, 5), I will evaluate moving further RIGHT toward (6, 4) or looping back UP to the open top-left area. Snake #1 is currently pinned in the bottom-left corner with limited escape routes.\n\nRIGHT",

Possible directions:\n- LEFT: OOB (-1,4), suicide.\n- RIGHT: (1,4) own body (first segment), suicide.\n- DOWN: (0,3) empty (row 3 col 0 unoccupied), no self/enemy overlap; post-move, new head (0,3), body shifts (tail (7,2) frees to new tail (7,3)), keeps south col 0 open but traps west uncoiling (next RIGHT (1,3) own body; limited east access until T55+ tail clears row 3).\n- UP: (0,5) current enemy head, but simultaneous move\u2014enemy must vacate (can't UP own body (0,6) or LEFT OOB; likely RIGHT (1,5) apple/eat to 14 or DOWN (0,4) vacated by me). No head-on (I sole mover to (0,5)); post-move, body shifts (tail frees (7,2)), no self-collision; preserves north col 0 claim.\n\nBoth DOWN/UP safe (no OOB/self/enemy static body; no backward for UP\u2014prior LEFT from (1,4), behind is RIGHT). Favor UP: Positions for T53 RIGHT (1,5) advance east (safe vs. enemy choices: swap if enemy LEFT, follow if RIGHT/DOWN; no collision risk), pulls body west/north for uncoiling (frees row 4 col 0-1 access T54+ toward (6,4)). DOWN suboptimal\u2014cedes (1,5) to enemy eat, strands south (row 0-3 col 0 loop, delayed east via tail clear T56+ for (7,0)/(9,1)), lower apple path efficiency vs. enemy len14 pressure.\n\n### Long-Term Plan\nT52: UP (0,5) claim north, body pulls (row 4 col 0 fills from east). Assume enemy RIGHT (1,5) eat14. T53: RIGHT (1,5)\u2014safe (vacated; swap if enemy LEFT (0,5), follow if RIGHT (2,5)/DOWN (1,4 my body, unlikely)). T54: From (1,5) RIGHT (2,5)\u2014safe (enemy vacates; pulls my body east, frees (0,4)/(1,4) for loop if needed). T55+: Continue east row 5 gaps (col 2-4 empty) to (3,5)/(4,5), skirt enemy row 5 body (col 5+ T, but enemy advances/retracts post-no-eat T54 len14-1=14 wait no, T53 no eat stay14, T54 retract if no eat to13). Target (6,4) eat12 ~T57 via row 4 drop if clear (my (5,4) shifts east T55+); if enemy chases west, pivot DOWN (x,4) south to (7,0) eat13 T59 circling row 2-0. Alt if enemy DOWN T52 to (0,4): T53 RIGHT (1,5) eat12/len13 (apple free), then UP (1,6)? Enemy body but shifts\u2014monitor.
