          "rationale": "We have a 10x10 board, apples at (3,9), (1,7), (2,6), (6,5), (1,8). Our snake (ID 0) head at (7,8), body empty (so we are length 1). Enemy snake #1 head at (2,3), body empty. Turn 0/150. All snakes move simultaneously. Need to pick a move that is safe and maximizes apple opportunities while staying alive.\n\nFirst, list all possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Compute new head positions:\n\n- UP: (7,9) (since y+1)\n- DOWN: (7,7)\n- LEFT: (6,8)\n- RIGHT: (8,8)\n\nNow check for immediate death for each:\n\n1. **UP to (7,9)**:\n   - Board boundaries: (7,9) is within board (x 0-9, y 0-9). Yes, y=9 is top row, valid.\n   - Snake collisions: Our body is empty, so no self-collision. Enemy snake #1 at (2,3) and body empty, so no enemy body at (7,9). However we need to consider head-on collisions: if enemy snake #1 also moves into (7,9) on the same turn? That's unlikely because they are far away. But we can't know their move. However the rules say: if two snake heads move into same cell, both die. We need to avoid that possibility. Since enemy is at (2,3), they could move left, right, up, down. Could they reach (7,9) in one move? No, they are at (2,3); to get to (7,9) they'd need to go right 5 and up 6, impossible in one turn. So head-on collision is impossible. So safe from immediate collision. Also no other snake bodies. So move UP is safe.\n\n2. **DOWN to (7,7)**:\n   - Within board: yes, y=7.\n   - No self body. No enemy body at (7,7). Could enemy head move to (7,7)? Enemy at (2,3) cannot reach in one turn. So safe.\n\n3. **LEFT to (6,8)**:\n   - Within board: yes.\n   - No self body. No enemy body at (6,8). Enemy cannot reach (6,8) in one turn? From (2,3) to (6,8) requires +4 in x, +5 in y, impossible. Safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8,8)**:\n   - Within board: yes.\n   - Safe from collisions.\n\nThus all four moves appear safe from immediate death. However we need to consider future options and apple proximity.\n\nApples: (3,9), (1,7), (2,6), (6,5), (1,8). Which are reachable? We are at (7,8). Let's compute Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (3,9): dx=|7-3|=4, dy=|8-9|=1, total 5.\n- (1,7): dx=6, dy=1, total 7.\n- (2,6): dx=5, dy=2, total 7.\n- (6,5): dx=1, dy=3, total 4.\n- (1,8): dx=6, dy=0, total 6.\n\nSo nearest apple is (6,5) with distance 4. Also (3,9) distance 5. So moving towards (6,5) could be good. (6,5) is at x=6, y=5. Our current (7,8). To get there, we need to go left and down. However moving left (to (6,8)) brings us closer in x, but still need down later. Moving down (to (7,7)) brings us closer in y but not x. Which direction gives better future options?\n\nAlso need to consider enemy snake #1 at (2,3). They might be going for apples too. Apples near them: (1,7) is at x=1,y=7 (distance from (2,3): dx=1, dy=4, total 5). (2,6) is at x=2,y=6 (distance 3). (1,8) is at (1,8) distance from (2,3): dx=1, dy=5, total 6. So they might go for (2,6) or (1,7). They might not interfere with us for now.\n\nBut we need to consider that after we eat an apple, we grow by 1 segment. Since we are currently length 1, after eating we become length 2, and our body will be the previous head position. This could affect future moves (collisions). So we need to think ahead.\n\nWe also need to consider that the board is only 10x10, and snake may become trapped if it grows too long and circles. But we have many turns (150) and only need to maximize apples.\n\nPotential long-term plan: We can aim to collect apples efficiently while avoiding the enemy. Since enemy is far, maybe we can focus on apples near us: (6,5) is closest, then maybe (3,9) or (1,8). However (3,9) is near top left, (1,8) also top left. (1,7) and (2,6) are near enemy.\n\nWe should also consider that after we eat, we need to ensure we don't trap ourselves. Since we have no body yet, we have lots of freedom.\n\nNow, which move is best among the four? Let's evaluate each:\n\n- UP to (7,9): This moves to top row. That might limit upward movement later (cannot go up further). However we could still move left/right/down. Apple (3,9) is on same y=9, but x=3. So moving to (7,9) puts us on same row as (3,9) but far left. From there we can go left along top row to reach it. However top row is a border; moving left along top row is fine. But also we need to consider that after moving up, our tail (if we eat) will be at (7,8). So body would be at (7,8). That might block us from going back down later. But that's okay.\n\n- DOWN to (7,7): Moves to y=7. Apple (1,7) is on same y=7, but far left. Could go left along y=7. Also (6,5) is south-west? Actually (6,5) is down-left from (7,7): dx=1 left, dy=2 down. So from (7,7) we can go left to (6,7) then down twice to (6,5). That seems fine. Also we are not at a border, so we have more flexibility.\n\n- LEFT to (6,8): Moves to x=6, y=8. That is one step left. This brings us closer to (6,5) (same x, lower y). From there we can go down twice to (6,6), (6,5) to eat. That's efficient. Also we are not at border.\n\n- RIGHT to (8,8): Moves away from apples generally. Rightmost column is x=9, so moving right makes us farther from all apples (closest is (6,5) which is left and down). So probably not optimal.\n\nThus RIGHT seems worst.\n\nNow between UP, DOWN, LEFT:\n\n- LEFT (to (6,8)): distance to nearest apple (6,5) reduces from 4 to 2? Actually from (7,8) to (6,5) Manhattan distance = |7-6|+|8-5|=1+3=4. From (6,8) to (6,5) = |6-6|+|8-5|=0+3=3. So reduces by 1. Also we are on the same x as the apple, which is good.\n\n- DOWN (to (7,7)): distance to (6,5) = |7-6|+|7-5|=1+2=3, also reduces by 1 (from 4 to 3). So both reduce distance by 1.\n\n- UP (to (7,9)): distance to (6,5) = |7-6|+|9-5|=1+4=5, actually increases distance! So UP moves us away from the nearest apple (6,5). However it moves us towards (3,9) (distance from (7,9) to (3,9) = 4, previously from (7,8) to (3,9) = 5). So UP brings us closer to (3,9). But (3,9) is farther overall.\n\nGiven that (6,5) is the closest apple, we should prioritize it. So LEFT or DOWN are both good. Which one gives more flexibility?\n\nConsider future moves after moving to (6,8) or (7,7).\n\nFrom (6,8):\nPossible moves: UP to (6,9) (border, but okay), DOWN to (6,7), LEFT to (5,8), RIGHT to (7,8) (which would be back to previous head, but that would be moving into our own body if we ate an apple? Actually if we eat an apple, our body grows, so after eating, our body would be at previous head. But we haven't eaten yet. At turn 0, we are moving to (6,8). If we don't eat an apple now (there is no apple at (6,8)), we remain length 1, and our tail remains at (7,8)? Actually the rules: snake grows only when moving onto an apple. If we don't eat, we just move, and the tail moves forward, so the snake's body will consist of the previous head (7,8) and the new head (6,8)? Wait, let's clarify: The snake is length 1 initially, so there is no body. When it moves without eating, the tail (which is also the head) moves to the new cell, so the snake remains length 1. There is no body left behind. So after moving to (6,8) without eating, we are still just head at (6,8), no body. So moving back to (7,8) would be moving into an empty cell (since the tail moved away). Actually if we move from (7,8) to (6,8) without eating, the snake's previous position (7,8) is now empty. So we could move back to (7,8) on the next turn without issue. So that's fine.\n\nFrom (6,8), we can go down to (6,7) which is closer to (6,5). So that seems good.\n\nFrom (7,7):\nPossible moves: UP (7,8) (previous head, but empty after move), DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7), RIGHT (8,7). This also gives good options.\n\nNow consider apple (6,5). From (6,8) we need to go down two steps: to (6,7) then (6,5) (actually (6,6) then (6,5)). From (7,7) we need to go left to (6,7) then down twice. So both similar.\n\nBut also consider that (6,5) is an apple; after eating it, we grow. That means after eating, our body will be at the previous head position. So if we eat at (6,5), our body will be at the cell we were at before (say (6,6) or (6,7) depending on path). That could affect subsequent moves.\n\nNow, what about the enemy snake? They are at (2,3). They might move towards apples (2,6) or (1,7). They could potentially collide with us if we both go to same apple later, but that's far away.\n\nWe also need to consider that moving to (6,8) is adjacent to (6,9) which is a border, but that's fine. Moving to (7,7) is more central.\n\nAnother factor: The board is 10x10, and we might want to avoid getting trapped. Since we are early and length 1, we can easily maneuver.\n\nPerhaps we should think about the apple at (3,9) which is on the top row. If we go to (6,8), we are one row below the top, and can go up to (6,9) then left along top to (3,9). However (6,9) is a border, but we can still move left along top row. That's okay.\n\nIf we go to (7,7), we are not on top row; to get to (3,9) we need to go up and left, which is fine.\n\nGiven the above, both LEFT and DOWN seem good. But we need to pick one. Let's also consider that the enemy snake might be moving towards (2,6) which is relatively close to us? Actually (2,6) is at x=2,y=6, still far. But if we go towards (6,5), we are moving away from enemy.\n\nNow, is there any risk of head-on collision with enemy? Unlikely.\n\nWhat about moving into an apple on this move? None of the possible moves land on an apple. Check each:\n\n- (7,9): no apple (apple at (3,9), (1,8) etc.)\n- (7,7): no apple.\n- (6,8): no apple.\n- (8,8): no apple.\n\nSo no immediate apple collection.\n\nThus we are just positioning.\n\nNow, which move maximizes future safe options? Let's consider the number of safe moves from each new position (considering that we will have a body after eating an apple, but currently no body). However, the board is open, so all directions are likely safe except maybe borders.\n\nFrom (6,8): possible moves: UP (6,9), DOWN (6,7), LEFT (5,8), RIGHT (7,8). All are within board. However we must also consider that if we move to (6,8) and then later move to (6,7), we need to ensure we don't have collisions. But no immediate concerns.\n\nFrom (7,7): possible moves: UP (7,8), DOWN (7,6), LEFT (6,7), RIGHT (8,7). All within board.\n\nFrom (7,9): possible moves: DOWN (7,8), LEFT (6,9), RIGHT (8,9). Up is out of board. So only 3 moves, but that's fine.\n\nFrom (8,8): possible moves: UP (8,9), DOWN (8,7), LEFT (7,8), RIGHT (9,8). All within board.\n\nSo all have at least 3 options, which is fine.\n\nNow, consider the apple at (6,5). If we go LEFT to (6,8), we are on the same column as the apple, which is advantageous. From (6,8), we can go DOWN to (6,7), then DOWN to (6,6), then DOWN to (6,5) to eat. That's a straight line. However we need to be careful: after each move, our body length increases only when we eat. So until we eat, we remain length 1, so no body to worry about. So we can just go straight down.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (7,7), then we need to go LEFT to (6,7), then DOWN to (6,6), then DOWN to (6,5). That's also fine but one extra turn (since we need to turn left). So LEFT to (6,8) is more direct to (6,5). So LEFT seems slightly better.\n\nWhat about other apples? (3,9) is also interesting. From (6,8) we can go UP to (6,9), then LEFT to (5,9), (4,9), (3,9). That's also a straight line. From (7,7) we could go UP to (7,8), then UP to (7,9), then LEFT to (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9) \u2013 more steps.\n\nThus LEFT seems better for both (6,5) and (3,9). However (6,5) is closer.\n\nAlso, consider that there is an apple at (1,8) and (1,7) near the left side. From (6,8) we can go left along row 8 to reach (1,8). That's a straight line left. From (7,7) we need to go up and left.\n\nThus LEFT appears to give more direct routes to multiple apples.\n\nTherefore, I think LEFT is the best move.\n\nBut wait: we need to consider that the enemy snake might also move and could potentially intercept. However, they are far. Unlikely.\n\nAlso, we must consider that moving LEFT to (6,8) might be safe, but what about the cell (6,8) being occupied by something else? No, it's empty.\n\nThus, I choose LEFT.\n\nBut let's double-check: The board state shows:\n\nRow 9: . . . A . . . . . . (apple at (3,9))\nRow 8: . A . . . . . 0 . . (apple at (1,8), our snake at (7,8))\nRow 7: . A . . . . . . . . (apple at (1,7))\nRow 6: . . A . . . . . . . (apple at (2,6))\nRow 5: . . . . . . A . . . (apple at (6,5))\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 3: . . 1 . . . . . . . (enemy at (2,3))\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nCoordinates: y from 0 bottom to 9 top. So row 9 is top, row 0 is bottom. Our snake at (7,8) is at row 8, column 7. Apple at (6,5) is row 5, column 6. So moving LEFT decreases x, so from x=7 to x=6, staying y=8. That's correct.\n\nThus, moving LEFT to (6,8) is safe.\n\nNow, I need to provide a short long-term plan or strategy note to my future self. The note will be shown as last rationale on the next turn. So I should include a plan before my final move. The plan can be a few sentences.\n\nPlan: \"Aim to collect apple at (6,5) first, as it's closest. Move left to align column, then down along column 6. Avoid enemy and consider other apples later.\"\n\nThen final move: LEFT.\n\nBut the instruction says: \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning. You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line. Coordinate reminder: decreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is the right. Decreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up. The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.\"\n\nThus my response should include the reasoning, then a plan, then the final move word.\n\nI will structure:\n\n- Reasoning: Evaluate moves, conclude LEFT is best.\n- Plan: A short note.\n- Final line: LEFT\n\nMake sure no extra characters after LEFT.\n\nAlso, note that the last move information was None, so no previous move to consider.\n\nNow, let's write the responseAfter evaluating all four possible moves from (7,8), I eliminated RIGHT because it moves away from the nearest apple. UP to (7,9) is safe but moves me farther from the closest apple at (6,5) and limits upward options. DOWN to (7,7) is safe and improves proximity to (6,5), but requires an extra turn to align columns. LEFT to (6,8) is safe, places me directly above the apple at (6,5) (distance reduced from 4 to 3), and offers straight-line access to several apples while keeping multiple path options open. No immediate collisions are possible with enemy snake #1 at (2,3) or board boundaries. Therefore, LEFT is the optimal move.\n\n**Plan:** Head toward the apple at (6,5) by moving left to align column, then descend along column 6 to eat it. Monitor enemy movements and consider pivoting to top-row apples afterward.\n\nLEFT",

But (2,5) is its own tail.

No, Snake #1 is at x=2.\n- Could Snake #1 move to (6,5)? No, it is too far away (distance 4).\n- Could Snake #1's head move into my intended path or my head?\n  - My head is moving from (6,6) to (6,5).\n  - Snake #1 is at (2,6).

No collision.\n  - If Snake #1 moves DOWN, it will be at (2,5). No collision.\n  - If Snake #1 moves UP, it will be at (2,7). No collision.\n  - If Snake #1 moves LEFT, it will be at (1,6). No collision.\n\nCheck for apple:\n- There is an apple at (6,5). Moving DOWN consumes it. I grow.\n\nCheck for traps:\n- From (6,5), I will be adjacent to the apple at (6,4)? No, (6,4) is empty.\n- Nearby obstacles: Wall at y=0. Snake #1 at (2,6).\n- At (6,5), I will have moves: UP (back to (6,6), occupied by my body? No, my body will shift: Head to (6,5), new body [6,6]. So (6,6) will be my body, so I cannot go back up). Wait, moving BACK into the cell my head just left is usually suicide. Let's verify.\n  - I move DOWN to (6,5).\n  - My body becomes [(6,6)].\n  - Next turn, if I try to move UP back to (6,6), I hit my own body.

I am not trapped.\n\nStrategy:\nI am at (6,6). The apple is at (6,5). Moving DOWN is the most efficient way to get the apple. This puts me on a path to the apple at (6,4) (if it exists, but here there isn't one) or allows me to turn towards the cluster on the left (x=1-3). Specifically, moving DOWN to (6,5) allows me to move LEFT to (5,5) and then DOWN to (5,4), approaching the apple at (1,8) or (3,9) eventually. If I go LEFT immediately from (6,6) to (5,6), I am moving laterally. If I go DOWN to (6,5), I am moving towards the apple at (6,5). Since the apple is directly below me, I should take it.\n\nDOWN",

The apple at (6, 5) was eaten.\n\nI need to verify the current board state and plan my next move. The prompt says \"Turn: 4 / 150\" and shows the board with my head at (6, 5) (represented by '0') and my tail at (6, 6) (represented by 'T').\n\nLet's analyze the board for Turn 4:\n*   **My position**: Head at (6, 5), Body at (6, 6).\n*   **Enemy Snake #1**: Head at (1, 6), Body at (2, 6). Previously it was Head (1, 6) -> Body (2, 6). Wait, the previous state showed Head (1, 6) -> Body (2, 6). The board shows `1` at (1, 6) and `T` at (2, 6). This means Snake #1 has moved *down* from (1, 7) to (1, 6) and its tail is at (2, 6). The previous body was (2, 6), so it must have grown? No, if the tail is (2, 6) and head is (1, 6), the body is just the tail. Let's re-read the previous state.\n    *   Previous Snake #1: Head (1, 6), Body [(2, 6)].\n    *   Current board shows `1` at (1, 6) and `T` at (2, 6).\n    *   This implies Snake #1 moved from (2, 6) to (1, 6)? No, heads move. If it was at (1, 6), moving to (1, 6) is impossible.\n    *   Let's look at the board logic. `1` is the head. `T` is the tail. The cell between them is empty (represented by a space).\n    *   So Snake #1 is just Head (1, 6) and Tail (2, 6). It is length 2. This means on the previous turn (Turn 3), Snake #1 likely moved DOWN to (1, 6) from (1, 7), and its tail was at (2, 6). Or maybe it moved LEFT from (2, 6)? No, the head is at (1, 6).\n    *   Actually, the board says: `6 . 1 T . . . T . . .`\n    *   Row 6 is y=6.\n    *   (1,6) is '1' (Head).\n    *   (2,6) is 'T' (Tail).\n    *   So Snake #1 is at (1,6) -> (2,6).\n    *   My head is at (6,5).\n\nNow I must decide where to move from (6, 5).\nValid moves:\n*   **UP**: Back to (6, 6). My body is currently at (6, 6). If I move UP, I hit my body. **Unsafe.**\n*   **DOWN**: To (6, 4). Empty. Safe.\n*   **LEFT**: To (5, 5). Empty. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT**: To (7, 5). Empty. Safe.\n\nI am currently at (6, 5). Where are the apples?\n*   (3, 9)\n*   (1, 7)\n*   (1, 8)\n*   (9, 1)\n*   (7, 0)\n\nI am at (6, 5).\n*   To (7, 0): Distance 5 + 5 = 10? No, (6,5) to (7,0) is dx=1, dy=5 => 6 steps.\n*   To (1, 7): dx=5, dy=2 => 7 steps.\n*   To (1, 8): dx=5, dy=3 => 8 steps.\n*   To (3, 9): dx=3, dy=4 => 7 steps.\n\nHowever, I must also consider the enemy snake at (1, 6).\nIf I go for the apples at (1, 7) or (1, 8), I might run into Snake #1.\nSnake #1 is at (1, 6). It can move to (1, 7) or (1, 5) or (0, 6) or (2, 6).\nSince there is an apple at (1, 7), Snake #1 might go for it.\nIf Snake #1 goes UP to (1, 7), it eats the apple and grows. Its body becomes (1, 6) and (2, 6) becomes (1, 6)? No. If it moves UP from (1,6) to (1,7), its tail becomes (1,6) and the previous body (2,6) becomes the new tail? No, the head moves.\nWait, Snake #1 is (1,6) -> (2,6). Length 2.\nIf Snake #1 moves UP to (1,7):\nHead becomes (1,7). Old head (1,6) becomes body. Old tail (2,6) becomes empty. New body is [(1,6)].\nSo Snake #1 becomes (1,7) -> (1,6).\nIf I move towards (1,7), I might encounter it.\n\nLet's look at the safe moves:\n*   **DOWN (6, 4)**: Moves away from most apples (except (7,0) which is far). However, it opens up the board downwards.\n*   **LEFT (5, 5)**: Moves towards the center. Opens up moves to (4,5), (5,4), (5,6), (6,5) (blocked by body next turn).\n    *   From (5, 5), I can reach (3,9) or (1,7/8).\n    *   (3,9) is open.\n    *   (1,7/8) is contested by Snake #1.\n*   **RIGHT (7, 5)**: Moves towards (9,1) and (7,0).\n    *   (7,0) is an apple.\n    *   (9,1) is an apple.\n\nLet's check for immediate traps.\nIf I go **LEFT to (5, 5)**:\nMy body becomes [(6, 5)].\nNext turn, I can go:\n- UP to (5, 6): Empty.\n- DOWN to (5, 4): Empty.\n- LEFT to (4, 5): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (6, 5): My body. Unsafe.\nSo 3 options.\n\nIf I go **DOWN to (6, 4)**:\nMy body becomes [(6, 5)].\nNext turn:\n- UP to (6, 5): Body. Unsafe.\n- LEFT to (5, 4): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (7, 4): Empty.\n- DOWN to (6, 3): Empty.\nSo 3 options.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (7, 5)**:\nMy body becomes [(6, 5)].\nNext turn:\n- UP to (7, 6): Empty.\n- DOWN to (7, 4): Empty.\n- LEFT to (6, 5): Body. Unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (8, 5): Empty.\nSo 3 options.\n\nLet's evaluate the targets.\n**Target 1: (7, 0)**\nFrom (6, 5), distance is 6.\nPath: (7,5) -> (7,4) -> (7,3) -> (7,2) -> (7,1) -> (7,0).\nThis looks clear.\n\n**Target 2: (9, 1)**\nFrom (6, 5), distance is 7.\nPath: (7,5) -> (8,5) -> (9,5) -> (9,4) -> (9,3) -> (9,2) -> (9,1).\n\n**Target 3: (1, 7) or (1, 8)**\nFrom (6, 5), distance is ~7-8.\nThis involves going LEFT. However, Snake #1 is at (1, 6). It might move UP to (1, 7) to eat the apple there. If it does, and I go for (1, 7), I might die (head-on or run into it). If Snake #1 eats (1, 7), it grows. If I then go to (1, 8), I might be okay, but (1, 8) is close to (1, 7) which might be the enemy's body.\n\n**Target 4: (3, 9)**\nFrom (6, 5), distance is 7.\nPath: (5,5) -> (4,5) -> (3,5) -> (3,6) -> (3,7) -> (3,8) -> (3,9).\nThis path seems clear.\n\nStrategy Decision:\nThe apples at (7,0) and (9,1) are in the bottom right. The apples at (1,7), (1,8), (3,9) are in the top left.\n\nCurrently at (6, 5).\nIf I go **RIGHT**:\nI move towards (7,0) and (9,1).\n(7,0) is the closest apple (6 steps).\n(9,1) is the second closest (7 steps).\nSnake #1 is far away on the left side.\nGoing RIGHT seems safe from the enemy.\n\nIf I go **LEFT**:\nI move towards (3,9) (7 steps) and (1,7) (7 steps).\nSnake #1 is at (1,6).\nSnake #1 can easily block or eat the apples at (1,7) and (1,8).\nContesting the left side is risky because of the enemy proximity.\n\nIf I go **DOWN**:\nI move towards nothing immediately. I can then turn to (7,0) or (9,1) in subsequent moves.\nDown to (6,4) -> Right to (7,4)...\nThis delays getting to the apples compared to going RIGHT immediately.\n\nLet's refine the plan.\nFrom (6, 5), if I go **RIGHT** to (7, 5):\n1. I close in on (7,0) and (9,1).\n2. (7,0) is directly below (7,5). I can go DOWN from (7,5) to (7,4), etc.\n3. (9,1) is to the right. I can go (8,5), (9,5), etc.\n\nAre there any traps?\n(7, 5) is empty.\nMy body will be at (6, 5).\nNext turn, from (7, 5), I have 4 moves, one blocked by my body (Left).\nSo 3 options.\nThe board at (7, 5) is open.\nThe wall is at x=9, y=0.\nEnemy is at x=1.\nSo RIGHT is safe.\n\nCan the enemy snake #1 reach (7, 5) or my path?\nNo, it is at (1, 6). Distance is 6 steps. It can't reach me in time.\n\nWhat if I go LEFT?\nIf I go to (5, 5), I am moving towards the enemy.\nSnake #1 might move UP to (1, 7) to eat the apple. Then it has a body at (1, 6).\nI might want (3, 9). Path: (5,5) -> (4,5) -> (3,5) -> (3,6) -> (3,7) -> (3,8) -> (3,9).\nThis path passes through (3, 6). Snake #1 is at (1, 6). If it moves right, it goes to (2, 6). It might try to block me.\nHowever, eating (7,0) seems more accessible and safer.\n\nLet's check if (7,0) or (9,1) are contested.\nThey are far right/bottom.\nSnake #1 is top left.\n\nDecision: Go RIGHT to (7, 5).\nThis is a safe move that initiates a chase for the apples at (7, 0) and (9, 1).\n\nWait, let's double check the board for any hidden dangers.\nBoard:\n`5 . . . . . . 0 . . .` (My head is at 6,5)\n`1 . . . . . . . . . A` (Apple at 9,1)\n`0 . . . . . . . A . .` (Apple at 7, 0)\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 5):\nNext turn I can go DOWN.\n(7, 4)\n(7, 3)\n(7, 2)\n(7, 1)\n(7, 0) -> Apple.\nThis is a straight line.\nThe only thing I need to watch out for is the tail.\nAt (7, 5), body is (6, 5).\nAt (7, 4), body is (7, 5), (6, 5).\n...\nAt (7, 0), body is (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5).\nThis is fine.\n\nWhat if I go DOWN to (6, 4)?\nFrom (6, 4), I can go RIGHT to (7, 4).\nThis is one turn slower than going directly to (7, 5).\n(6, 4) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 3) -> (7, 2) -> (7, 1) -> (7, 0).\nvs\n(7, 5) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 3) -> (7, 2) -> (7, 1) -> (7, 0).\nGoing RIGHT now saves a turn.\n\nSo, RIGHT is the best move to get the apple at (7, 0).\nBut wait, is there an apple at (6, 4) or nearby? No.\nSo moving to (7, 5) is purely positional.\n\nIs there any reason NOT to go RIGHT?\nMaybe the enemy moves towards the center?\nIt's at (1, 6). If it moves right repeatedly, it might come towards the center.\nBut I am at (6, 5). I am faster towards the right apples.\n\nLet's consider if the enemy moves to (2, 6) -> (3, 6)...\nEven if it rushes me, it takes many turns.\nI can secure (7, 0) and (9, 1) and turn back if needed.\n\nActually, let's look at the apple at (3, 9).\nDistance from (6, 5) is 7.\nDistance from (1, 6) is roughly 5.\nSnake #1 is much closer to (3, 9) and (1, 7), (1, 8).\nI should leave those to it (or avoid them) and take the ones on the right.\n\nSo, RIGHT is the optimal move.\n\nOne final check on traps.\n(7, 5) is empty.\nMy body is at (6, 5). So I cannot go LEFT next turn.\nThat leaves UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\nUP to (7, 6) is empty.\nDOWN to (7, 4) is empty.\nRIGHT to (8, 5) is empty.\nAll good.\n\nPlan:\nGo RIGHT to (7, 5).\nThen plan to go DOWN towards (7, 0).\nOr if the enemy interferes, go for (9, 1).\n\nActually, looking at the board again.\nApple at (9, 1).\nApple at (7, 0).\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 5), I am on the same x-coordinate as (7, 0).\nIf I go DOWN, I eat (7, 0).\nIf I go RIGHT -> (8, 5) -> (9, 5) -> ... -> (9, 1), I eat (9, 1).\nGoing for (7, 0) seems like the immediate goal because it's \"straight down\" from (7, 5).\n\nWait, if I go RIGHT to (7, 5), I am at (7, 5).\nIf I go DOWN, I go to (7, 4).\n...\n(7, 0).\nThis is a safe path.\nThe alternative path to (9, 1) is (8, 5) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4) -> ... -> (9, 1).\nThis path requires more turns.\n(7, 0) is 5 turns away from (7, 5).\n(9, 1) is 6 turns away from (7, 5) via the shortest path? No.\n(7, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4) -> (9, 3) -> (9, 2) -> (9, 1) = 6 moves.\n(7, 5) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 3) -> (7, 2) -> (7, 1) -> (7, 0) = 5 moves.\nSo (7, 0) is the closer apple.\n\nSo the plan is: RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN -> DOWN -> DOWN -> DOWN -> (7, 0).\n\nIs there any apple at (6, 4)? No.\nIs there any apple at (5, 5)? No.\nSo moving to (7, 5) is correct.\n\nWait, let's re-read the prompt carefully.\n\"Your snake (ID: 0): - Head: (6, 5) - Body: [(6, 6)]\"\n\"Board state: ... 5 . . . . . . 0 . . .\"\nThe board confirms I am at (6, 5).\nMy body is at (6, 6).\nSo I cannot go UP.\n\nLet's check LEFT.\nLeft is (5, 5).\nFrom (5, 5), I can go DOWN to (5, 4), then RIGHT to (6, 4), then DOWN...\nThis is a roundabout way to (7, 0).\n(5, 5) -> (5, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 3) -> (7, 2) -> (7, 1) -> (7, 0).\nThat's 7 moves from (5, 5). 8 moves from (6, 5).\nDirectly going RIGHT: 5 moves.\nSo RIGHT is much faster.\n\nWhat about the apple at (9, 1)?\nGoing RIGHT first is necessary to get to (9, 1) as well.\n(6, 5) -> (7, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4) -> (9, 3) -> (9, 2) -> (9, 1).\nSo RIGHT is the first step for both apples on the right.\n\nSo the decision is definitely RIGHT.\n\nFinal check on safety.\nEnemy at (1, 6).\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (2, 6), then (3, 6), etc., it will take a long time to reach me.\nI am at (6, 5).\nIf I move to (7, 5), I am 3 steps away from the center (x=4 or 5).\nIf enemy moves aggressively, I still have time to react.\nAlso, if I eat (7, 0), I grow. That gives me more length to defend or block.\n\nIs there any apple closer than (7, 0)? No.\n(1, 7) is distance 7.\n(3, 9) is distance 7.\n(9, 1) is distance 7.\n(7, 0) is distance 6.\n(1, 8) is distance 8.\nSo (7, 0) is technically the closest apple by 1 step (6 vs 7).\nHowever, path safety matters.\nPath to (7, 0): Right then down. Empty.\nPath to (1, 7): Left. Contested by Enemy.\nPath to (3, 9): Left and Up. Contested.\nPath to (9, 1): Right and Down. Safe.\n\nSo RIGHT is the safest and most efficient move towards the closest apple (7, 0) and the second closest (9, 1).\n\nOne small detail: The enemy is at (1, 6). There is an apple at (1, 7).\nThe enemy might move UP to (1, 7). That's good for me because it distracts it from other apples.\nThe enemy is at (1, 6). There is an apple at (3, 9).\nThe enemy might try to get that.\nBut I am closer to the right side apples.\n\nDecision: RIGHT.\n\nFinal check: Does moving RIGHT kill me?\n- Off board? No. (7, 5) is within 0-9.\n- Own body? My body is (6, 6). (7, 5) is not (6, 6).\n- Enemy body? Enemy is at (1, 6) and (2, 6). (7, 5) is far away.\n- Head-on? Enemy is at (1, 6). It can move to (2, 6), (1, 7), (1, 5), (0, 6). None of these are (7, 5).\nSo RIGHT is safe.\n\nLong term plan:\nMove RIGHT to (7, 5).\nThen move DOWN repeatedly to eat the apple at (7, 0).\nThen move towards (9, 1).\nAvoid the top-left quadrant as it is likely contested by Snake #1.\n\nMove: RIGHT.\n\nOUTPUT:\nRIGHT",

The apples are at (3, 9), (9, 1), (7, 0), (9, 3), and (7, 1). Enemy snake #1 is at (2, 8) with a body extending down to (1, 6).\n\n**1. Eliminate immediately fatal moves:**\n- **LEFT:** Moving to (7, 4). Looking at the board state and the \"last move\" info, my body was previously at (8, 5) and (7, 5). In the last turn, I moved DOWN from (8, 5) to (8, 4). The tail moves from (7, 5) to (8, 5) after I move (standard snake mechanics). So, after my move, (7, 4) is empty. Wait, the \"last move\" info says my head was at (8, 5) and body at (7, 5). I moved DOWN. So the new head is (8, 4). The old head (8, 5) becomes the first body segment. The old body (7, 5) becomes the tail. So current body is (8, 5), (7, 5). The cell to my LEFT is (7, 4). This is empty.\n- **UP:** Moving to (8, 5). This is my current first body segment. In the next turn, the tail will move, but standard snake mechanics dictate that moving into the space the head just vacated is safe (unless the snake is length 2 and moving backwards), but moving into the *current* body segment is fatal. Wait, let's look at the body list: `Body: [(8, 5), (7, 5)]`. The cell directly behind the head is (8, 5). Since I am not length 2, the tail (7, 5) will move forward to (8, 5) if I move forward. However, the rule says \"moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself\". The cell directly behind my head (8, 4) is (8, 5). That is my first body segment. If I move UP to (8, 5), I hit my own body. **Fatal.**\n- **DOWN:** Moving to (8, 3). This cell is empty (dot). Safe.\n- **RIGHT:** Moving to (9, 4). This cell is empty (dot). Safe.\n\nSo, UP is fatal. LEFT, DOWN, and RIGHT are potentially safe.\n\n**2. Evaluate safe moves:**\n- **LEFT (7, 4):** This leads towards the west side of the board. There are no apples immediately here. It keeps me away from the enemy snake #1 who is in the far west/north. It also doesn't give me an apple.\n- **DOWN (8, 3):** This leads towards the apples at (9, 1) and (7, 0). (8, 3) is empty.\n- **RIGHT (9, 4):** This moves me towards the right edge. There is an apple at (9, 3) directly below this if I survive the turn. (9, 3) is an apple.\n\n**3. Strategy & Future Planning:**\n- **Targeting:** I need to eat apples to win. I have 2 apples; Snake #1 has 3. I need to catch up.\n- **Enemy Analysis:** Snake #1 is at (2, 8). Their body is (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6). They are far away and unlikely to interfere with me on the right side.\n- **Move Choice:**\n    - If I go DOWN to (8, 3), I can potentially go for the apple at (9, 1) or (7, 0).\n    - If I go RIGHT to (9, 4), I am on the edge. Next turn I could go DOWN to (9, 3) to eat that apple. This seems like a safe, calculated move to secure an apple.\n- **Long-term Plan:** Secure the apple at (9, 3) next turn. Then, head towards the cluster at (9, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0).\n\nLet's look at the board again for (9, 4).\nCurrent position: (8, 4).\nMoving RIGHT goes to (9, 4).\nIs (9, 4) safe? Yes, it's a dot.\nIs it a good position? Yes, it sets me up to go DOWN to (9, 3) which is an apple.\n\nLet's double check the UP move being fatal.\nHead: (8, 4).\nBody: (8, 5), (7, 5).\nMoving UP goes to (8, 5). This is currently occupied by my body. Even if the tail moves, the head moves *simultaneously*. So I would move into (8, 5) while it is still occupied by my body. This is suicide.\n\nSo, LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\nDOWN (8, 3) -> Next turn can go DOWN to (8, 2) -> (8, 1) -> (8, 0). No apples at x=8 except (9,3). So DOWN is not immediately rewarding.\nRIGHT (9, 4) -> Next turn can go DOWN to (9, 3) (Apple). Or if blocked, UP to (9, 5) or LEFT to (8, 4). This keeps my head on the edge which is generally safer (fewer directions to be attacked from).\nLEFT (7, 4) -> Moves away from the immediate apple cluster.\n\nI will choose RIGHT. This positions me to eat the apple at (9, 3) on the next turn.\n\nWait, I should check if any snake is close enough to threaten me if I move RIGHT.\nSnake #1 is at (2, 8). Distance is huge. I am safe.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT.\n\nRationale: Moving RIGHT to (9, 4) is safe and positions my head adjacent to the apple at (9, 3). This allows me to eat the apple next turn. Moving DOWN or LEFT would not provide an immediate path to an apple. Moving UP is fatal as it goes into my own body at (8, 5). This move also keeps my head near the edge of the board, reducing the number of potential attack vectors from the enemy snake.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat the apple at (9, 3) next turn. Then move towards the cluster of apples at (9, 1) and (7, 0) while maintaining distance from Snake #1.RIGHT",

I die.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nI must choose between UP (9, 5) and DOWN (9, 3).\n-   **Option DOWN (9, 3):** Moves directly onto an apple. This increases my score by 1 and causes me to grow. Growing extends my tail, meaning I won't clear the spot (9, 4) for my body to move into it next turn (it will stay occupied).\n-   **Option UP (9, 5):** Moves to an empty spot. No apple. My body will shift, and (9, 4) will become my first body segment.\n-   **Enemy Analysis:** Snake #1 is at (3, 8) with a body of length 3. Their coordinates are far from mine (x-difference of 6). They are not a threat this turn.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince DOWN is an available apple and is safe (not blocked by my body immediately, as I am moving onto it), I should take it. It is always better to score a point if it doesn't kill you. While I will be forced to turn (either LEFT or UP) next turn because my body will block the way back, securing the point is the priority.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

A . . .\n- **Row 8:** . T T T . . . . . .\n- **Row 7:** T . A . . . . . . .\n- **Row 6:** . . . . . . . . . .\n- **Row 5:** . . . . . . . . T .\n- **Row 4:** . . . . . . . .

A . .\n\n**Identifying Threats:**\n1.  **Immediate Self-Collision:**\n    - Moving **UP** to (9, 4) puts my head where my body *currently* is. Since the body is a rigid list, the segment (9, 4) will move to (9, 5) as we move up. Wait, if I am at (9, 3), my body is (9, 4)... moving UP puts me back into (9, 4). However, in simultaneous movement, the tail moves away. But the rule states \"If your head moves into any snake's body... you die\". The body segment (9, 4) is currently present. Even if it moves, do we collide? Usually, if the head moves into a square occupied by the body *before* the move, and that body part is not the tail moving away, it's a collision. With a length of 4, the tail (8, 5) moves to (8, 6), but (9, 4) is the second segment. It will move to (9, 5). So (9, 4) will be vacated? No, wait. If I move UP:\n        - My head goes (9, 3) -> (9, 4).\n        - Segment 2 goes (9, 4) -> (9, 5).\n        - Segment 3 goes (8, 4) -> (8, 5).\n        - Segment 4 goes (8, 5) -> (8, 6).\n        - This seems valid (no collision). BUT, wait. My current head is (9, 3). My body is (9, 4). Moving UP puts me into (9, 4). Is (9, 4) part of my body? Yes. Is it the tail? No, the tail is (8, 5). Generally, moving into the square directly occupied by your body (except the very tip of the tail which moves away) is death.\n        - However, let's look at the provided `Board State` again.\n          - Row 4: `. . . . . . . . T T` (at x=8 and x=9).\n          - Row 3: `. . . . . . . . . 0` (at x=9).\n        - My body is `[(9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5)]`.\n        - If I move UP to (9, 4), I am moving into the location of my second body segment. I will die.\n\n2.  **Snake #1 Movement:**\n    - Snake #1 Head: (3, 9).\n    - Apples: (3, 7), (6, 9), (9, 1), (7, 0), (7, 1).\n    - Snake #1 is at the top. It is near apple (3, 7) (down 2) and apple (6, 9) (right 3). It might move DOWN or RIGHT. It cannot reach me (9, 3) this turn.\n\n**Evaluating My Moves:**\n- **UP (9, 4):** As analyzed, this is the square directly behind my head currently. It is occupied by my body. Collision. **DEAD.**\n- **DOWN (9, 2):** Empty. Safe. (Last move rationale mentioned moving down to (9, 3) was an apple, but now I am at (9, 3). So (9, 2) is the new down).\n- **LEFT (8, 3):** Empty (Row 3: `. . . . . . . . . 0`). Safe.\n- **RIGHT (10, 3):** Off board. **DEAD.**\n\n**Strategy:**\n- I have 2 safe moves: DOWN and LEFT.\n- Current Position: (9, 3).\n- Potential apples:\n  - (9, 1) is 2 squares DOWN.\n  - (7, 1) is 2 LEFT, 2 DOWN.\n  - (7, 0) is 2 LEFT, 3 DOWN.\n- Moving **DOWN** brings me closer to the apples at (9, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0). It also keeps me in the column with an apple (if there was one below, but we know (9, 1) is there).\n- Moving **LEFT** moves me away from (9, 1) but towards (7, 1) and (7, 0).\n- If I move DOWN to (9, 2):\n  - Next turn, I can move DOWN to (9, 1) (Apple).\n- If I move LEFT to (8, 3):\n  - Next turn, I can move DOWN to (8, 2).\n- The board is open.\n- Let's prioritize the apple at (9, 1). It is in the same column. Moving DOWN now sets up a direct path to (9, 1).\n- The move UP is fatal.\n- The move RIGHT is fatal.\n\nSo the choice is between DOWN and LEFT.\nThe rationale \"END LAST MOVE RATIONALE\" says I moved DOWN to (9, 3) to eat an apple.\nSo I am currently on an apple. I am growing.\nSince I am growing, my tail will not clear (8, 5). It will stay (8, 5) becomes (8, 6).\nBut since I am at (9, 3), the cell behind me is (9, 4).\nIf I move UP, I hit (9, 4).\nIf I move DOWN, I go to (9, 2).\nIf I move LEFT, I go to (8, 3).\n\nWait, checking the board again.\nRow 4: `. . . . . . . . T T`\nRow 3: `. . . . . . . . . 0`\nMy body is listed as `[(9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5)]`.\nSo (9, 4) is occupied.\nTherefore UP is fatal.\n\nDecision:\nDOWN is safer because it moves me towards the corner where apples (9, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0) are.\nLEFT is also safe, but DOWN aligns with the column of the closest apple (9, 1).\nI will choose DOWN.\n\nReasoning:\n1.  Identify my position: (9, 3).\n2.  Identify threats:\n    - UP: Moves into my body at (9, 4). Fatal.\n    - RIGHT: Off board. Fatal.\n3.  Identify safe moves:\n    - DOWN: (9, 2). Empty. Safe.\n    - LEFT: (8, 3). Empty. Safe.\n4.  Select best safe move:\n    - Target: Apples at (9, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0).\n    - Moving DOWN moves me 1 step closer to (9, 1).\n    - Moving LEFT moves me away from (9, 1) and sideways to the other apples.\n    - Since I just moved DOWN to get to (9, 3), continuing DOWN to chase (9, 1) is consistent.\n    - No enemy threats.\n\nFinal check:\n- Moving DOWN to (9, 2) is valid.\n- The cell (9, 2) is empty on the board.\n- The cell (9, 2) is not part of my body.\n- It is not off the board.\n\nTherefore, I will move DOWN.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thoughts\": \"I am currently at (9, 3). My body extends to (9, 4). Moving UP would put my head in (9, 4), which is currently occupied by my body, causing me to die. Moving RIGHT takes me off the board. I must choose between DOWN (to 9, 2) or LEFT (to 8, 3). Both are empty and safe. There is an apple at (9, 1). Moving DOWN aligns me with that apple and keeps me close to the bottom-right corner where other apples (7, 1, 7, 0) are located. Moving LEFT is also safe but delays reaching (9, 1). I will move DOWN to chase the (9, 1) apple.\"\n}\n```\n\nDOWN",

My body will extend to (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5). The path is clear.\n        *   **Gain:** +1 Apple.\n        *   **Positioning:** Puts me in the bottom-right corner. It's a tight space (right edge and bottom edge), but there are apples there ((9, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0)). I can eat (9, 1) immediately. Next turn I can move to (8, 1) or (9, 0) to chase (7, 1) or (7, 0).\n    *   **LEFT (8, 2):**\n        *   **Safety:** Safe. Moves me into open space.\n        *   **Gain:** 0 Apples.\n        *   **Positioning:** Moves me away from the apple at (9, 1). It offers more flexibility for movement in the center, but leaves the apple at (9, 1) on the board for potential interference later (though Snake #1 is far away at (4,9)).\n\n3.  **Strategy:**\n    *   My goal is to collect apples.\n    *   The apple at (9, 1) is adjacent to my head. Eating it yields a point and increases my length, which is generally good.\n    *   Moving LEFT delays eating this apple. Since I can safely eat it now, I should.\n    *   Eating (9, 1) places my head at the bottom right. From there, the next target would be the cluster at (7, 1) and (7, 0).\n\n4.  **Enemy Check:**\n    *   Snake #1 is at (4, 9). It cannot reach me this turn. No head-on collision risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** DOWN is the best move because it allows me to safely eat an adjacent apple, scoring a point and growing my snake.\n\nDOWN",

The previous rationale stated the intention to move LEFT to (8, 1), but the board state visualization and coordinates list my head at (8, 1). This implies the move LEFT was successfully executed in turn 11 (or the state provided is post-move). Regardless of the discrepancy, I am currently at (8, 1).\n\n**Current Analysis:**\n*   **Head:** (8, 1)\n*   **Body:** [(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4)]\n*   **Apples Nearby:** (7, 1), (7, 0), (2, 1).\n*   **Snake #1:** Head at (6, 9). Body snakes down from there. It is far away.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1.  **UP (8, 2):** The board shows (8, 2) is empty ('.'). It is safe. However, it moves away from the apple cluster at (7, 1) and (7, 0).\n2.  **DOWN (8, 0):** The board shows (8, 0) is empty ('.'). It is safe. It moves towards the bottom edge but away from the nearest apple (7, 1).\n3.  **LEFT (7, 1):** The board shows an apple ('A') at (7, 1). This is safe (not a body part) and scores a point. This is the most immediate reward.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 1):** The board shows 'T' (tail) at (9, 1). My body is currently [(9, 1), ...]. The tail moves away as I move, so technically this is safe (I can move back into where my tail just was). However, moving back to (9, 1) is a \"dead end\" move discussed in the previous turn. It offers no progress towards apples and limits options.\n\n**Strategy:**\nEating the apple at (7, 1) is the priority. It keeps me in a central position relative to the other apples at (7, 0) and (2, 1). Moving UP or DOWN delays this gain and risks losing the apple to potential board dynamics or self-trapping later.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (7, 1) to eat the apple.

Keeps moving towards the target apple at (2, 1).\n2.  **UP (6, 1):** Safe. This moves into the column directly above the head. Let's check if this leads to a trap.\n    *   From (6, 1), we could potentially go Left to (5, 1) or Right to (7, 1). However, (7, 1) is part of our body. (6, 1) itself is currently empty.\n    *   However, looking at the body structure: My body spans from (7, 0) -> (7, 1) -> (8, 1)...\n    *   If I go UP to (6, 1), I am sitting right next to my body at (7, 1).\n    *   From (6, 1), if I need to maneuver later, I might be restricted.\n    *   Moving UP also moves me away from the target apple at (2, 1) which is on Y-level 1. If I go UP to (6, 1), I have to eventually go DOWN to (6, 0) or LEFT to (5, 1) to reach (2, 1).\n\n**Strategy:**\nI am hunting the apple at (2, 1). My current X is 6, so I need to go Left. My current Y is 0, and the target Y is 1. I am currently on the bottom row. Moving UP now to (6, 1) places me on the same row as the target apple, but it also tightens my maneuvering space because the bottom row (y=0) is a safe boundary I can use. If I go UP, I lose the \"floor\" safety.\nFurthermore, checking the \"Last Move\" context: I previously moved LEFT from (7,0) to (6,0). My body is trailing to the right.\nIf I go UP to (6,1), I will be \"sandwiched\" between my body at (7,1) (East) and my tail expanding East.\nLet's reconsider the board map provided:\nRow 1 is `1 . . A A . . . T T T`\nRow 0 is `0 . . . . . . 0 T . .`\nAt (6,0), going UP puts me at (6,1). (7,1) is my body. (5,1) is empty.\nHowever, looking at the coordinates of the apples: (3,1) and (2,1). They are very close horizontally.\nIf I go LEFT to (5,0), I stay on the open bottom row. From (5,0), I can go UP to (5,1) to prepare for the apples.\nWhy is UP to (6,1) potentially bad? Because my body is at (7,1). If I go to (6,1), I am effectively \"stuck\" between my body and the open space to the left. But actually, (6,1) is a valid square.\nLet's look at the enemy Snake #1 at (8,8). They are far away. No immediate head-on threat.\nLet's look at the square (7, 1). It is occupied by my body.\nLet's look at the square (5, 1). It is empty.\nLet's look at the square (5, 0). It is empty.\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 0), I am 1 unit away from the X of the apples (2,3). This is good.\nIf I go UP to (6, 1), I am 4 units away from the apples X (2,3).\nThe apples are at (2,1) and (3,1). These are on Y=1.\nIf I stay on Y=0 (going LEFT), I can easily go UP to Y=1 when I am closer (e.g., at X=2).\nIf I go UP to Y=1 now (at X=6), I will be walking along the row above. My tail is currently at (9,3). The body connects (6,0)->(7,0)->(7,1)...\nWait, if I go UP to (6,1), my head is at (6,1). My body is at (7,0), (7,1)... So (7,1) is directly to my right. (5,1) is to my left.\nThe move LEFT to (5,0) allows me to set up a \"staircase\" or direct approach. (5,0) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> UP to (3,1) (Apple!).\nThis seems safer and more direct than going UP to (6,1) where I might have to snake around (7,1).\nThe empty space at (6,1) is available, but moving there seems unnecessary. The target is at Y=1, but specifically at X=2,3. I am at X=6. I need to close the X distance. Moving UP doesn't close the X distance.\nTherefore, LEFT is the best move to close the distance to the apples while maintaining safe maneuvering space on the open bottom row.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

I just ate an apple here.\nMy body currently occupies: (3, 1) [new head], (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (8, 1) [tail]. Total length: 8.\nTarget: There is an apple at (2, 1).\n\nMove Analysis:\n1.  **LEFT**: Target is (2, 1).\n    *   **Safety**: (2, 1) is an apple. It is not in my current body list (which starts at 4,1). The cell (2, 1) is empty on the board map (represented as an 'A'). Since I am moving into an empty cell (apple) that is not part of my body, this is safe.\n    *   **Outcome**: I eat the apple. My length becomes 9. My tail remains at (8, 1) for this turn as well. This maximizes my score and keeps my escape route open.\n2.  **UP**: Target is (3, 2).\n    *   **Safety**: (3, 2) is empty on the board map ('.'). It is not in my body. Safe.\n    *   **Outcome**: I move away from the apple at (2, 1).\n3.  **DOWN**: Target is (3, 0).\n    *   **Safety**: (3, 0) is empty on the board map ('.'). It is not in my body (my body is at (5,0), (6,0), (7,0)). Safe.\n    *   **Outcome**: I move away from the apple at (2, 1).\n4.  **RIGHT**: Target is (4, 1).\n    *   **Safety**: (4, 1) is currently my second body segment. Since I am moving into a cell occupied by my own body, this is suicide (illegal move).\n\nConclusion: LEFT is the only move that gains a point and is safe. UP and DOWN are safe but suboptimal. RIGHT is fatal.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

If Snake #1 chooses DOWN, we both die.\n    *   If Snake #1 moves **RIGHT**: (8, 5). Occupied by its own body (tail). Dead.\n\nSnake #1 (at 7 apples) must survive to outscore me (8 apples).

Is that occupied?\nLooking at the previous body list: [(1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1)...]\nThe segment at (1, 1) is connected to (1, 0).\nHowever, looking at the board visualization:\n```\n 1 . T T T T T . . . .\n 0 0 T . . . T T . . .\n```\nThe 'T' at (0, 1) corresponds to the body part. So (0, 1) is occupied by my body.\nThe 'T' at (1, 0) is the second segment.\nWait, let me trace the body list again: `[(1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0)]`.\n1. (1, 0)\n2.

The board visualization might be misleading or the 'T' at (0, 1) is actually empty or part of the board drawing connecting the vertical segment.\nLet's look at the list again.

The enemy is at (2, 3).\n*   Enemy's likely target: The apple at (0, 5) is in their line of sight.

But if I go UP to (0, 4) now, and the enemy goes UP to (2, 4) [Wait, (2,4) is their body], they cannot go UP. They must go LEFT or UP? (2,4) is occupied by their body. They can go LEFT to (1,3) or DOWN to (2,2).\n*   **Re-evaluating Enemy Move:** The enemy head is at (2, 3). The cell (2, 4) is their body. (1, 3) is free. (2, 2) is free.

If they go UP to (1, 4) and I go UP to (0, 5), safe. If they go LEFT to (0, 3) and I go UP to (0, 5), safe.\n        *   **However:** If I go **RIGHT** to (1, 3):\n            *   The enemy is likely moving **LEFT** to (1, 3).\n            *   **BANG!** Head-on collision. Both die.\n*   **Why is UP the better choice?**\n    *   If I go UP, I maintain the path to the apple at (0, 5). Even if the enemy goes LEFT, they are only at (1, 3). They cannot eat the apple at (0, 5) next turn. They would need two turns to get to (0, 5).\n    *   If I go UP, I am at (0, 4). Next turn, I eat the apple at (0, 5).\n    *   If I go RIGHT, I risk a head-on collision with the enemy who is highly likely to move LEFT to chase the same apple.\n    *   Furthermore, going **UP** keeps me on the left wall, maintaining a clear path and avoiding the clutter of the board center where the enemy is.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove **UP**. It is safe, avoids the immediate head-on collision risk posed by moving RIGHT into the enemy's likely path, and progresses directly toward the nearest apple.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (0, 5) next turn. After that, pivot right towards the apples at (3, 7) or (7, 1), keeping the enemy in the top right corner in mind.\nEND RATIONALE\nUP",

My likely move is UP to (0, 5).\n    - The enemy is at (2, 3). The apple at (0, 5) is visible to them.\n    - If the enemy attempts to intercept me, they would need to move to (0, 5) or a square blocking my path.\n    - Calculating time to (0, 5):\n        - **Me:** 1 turn (Move UP -> (0, 5)).\n        - **Enemy:** 4 turns (e.g., LEFT to (1,3), LEFT to (0,3), UP to (0,4), UP to (0,5)).\n    - Because I am strictly closer to the apple, I will eat it before the enemy can reach it.\n    - If the enemy moves to intercept *after* I have eaten the apple, they will be chasing my tail, putting me at a massive advantage.\n- **Safety Check:**\n    - If I move UP to (0, 5), I am at (0, 5).\n    - If the enemy moves RIGHT to (3, 3), they are far away.\n    - If the enemy moves LEFT to (1, 3), they are far away.\n    - There is no path for the enemy to land on (0, 5) this turn.\n- **Conclusion:** Moving UP is safe, gains a point, and there is no immediate collision threat because I am strictly faster to the target apple than the enemy.\n\n**Long-term Plan**\nEat the apple at (0, 5) immediately. After securing (0, 5), look to navigate towards the apple at (3, 7) or (7, 1), keeping the wall on my left to maintain a safe boundary while avoiding the enemy currently patrolling the right side.\n\nUP",

I have no apple directly adjacent to me at (0, 5). The apples are located at (3, 7), (9, 9), (3, 9), (7, 1), (6, 9).\n- **Path Analysis:**\n    - Moving **UP** to (0, 6) keeps me pinned against the left wall. From (0, 6), my only future option is likely UP again to (0, 7), leading to a dead end at (0, 9). This path restricts my movement significantly.\n    - Moving **RIGHT** to (1, 5) moves me off the wall and into the open board. This keeps future options open. From (1, 5), I can navigate up towards the apples at (3, 7) and (3, 9), or right/down towards others. It also prevents me from getting trapped in the corner.\n- **Enemy Interaction:**\n    - The enemy is at (3, 2) and seems to be patrolling the right side or heading towards (7, 1) or the cluster on the right.\n    - Moving **RIGHT** to (1, 5) moves me closer to the center, but I am still far from the enemy.\n    - Moving **UP** to (0, 6) isolates me.\n- **Conclusion:** Moving **RIGHT** is the safer choice to avoid getting trapped in the corner and maintains mobility. I will move towards the apples at the top (y=9).\n\n**Long-term Plan**\nMove RIGHT to (1, 5) to open up mobility. From there, plan a path UP towards the apples at (3, 7) and (3, 9), utilizing the open space in the center of the board.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving here would be moving backwards, which is fatal. **DEADLY.**\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 5):** Empty. Safe.\n\n**Strategic Reasoning**\n- **Immediate Goal:** Navigate towards the apples at the top of the board ((3, 7), (3, 9), (6, 9), (9, 9)). I am currently at (1, 5).\n- **Path Analysis:**\n    - Moving **LEFT** is impossible as it kills me.\n    - Moving **DOWN** to (1, 4) moves me further away from the primary cluster of apples at y=9. It also positions me closer to the apple at (7, 1), but that is further away and potentially contested by Snake #1.\n    - Moving **UP** to (1, 6) increases my y-coordinate, getting me closer to the top apples.\n    - Moving **RIGHT** to (2, 5) increases my x-coordinate, moving towards the center and the top apples.\n- **Comparison of Safe Moves:**\n    - From **(1, 6)**, I can go UP, RIGHT (to 2,6), or LEFT (back to 1,5). The path UP to (1,7) seems promising as it heads directly towards (3,7).\n    - From **(2, 5)**, I have a very open field. I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n    - While (1, 6) is a good step towards (1,7) and (3,7), moving **RIGHT** to (2, 5) opens up the most options for the subsequent turn. It shifts me from the left edge towards the center, allowing me to approach the top-right apples ((6,9), (9,9)) if the path to the left-top apples is blocked.\n- **Enemy Interaction:** Snake #1 is at (4, 2). They are currently moving away from me or staying in the bottom-right quadrant. They are not an immediate threat to my current position or my immediate path upwards. I should focus on securing my own growth.\n\n**Long-term Plan**\nMove RIGHT to (2, 5) to centralize and approach the top apple cluster. From (2, 5), I will likely aim UP towards (2, 6) and then (3, 7) in subsequent turns. I need to ensure I don't get trapped against the wall.\n\nRIGHT",

The space at (3, 6) is currently empty, and the path UP from there to (3, 7) is also clear. This is the most direct and efficient way to score a point.\n    - Moving **RIGHT** to (4, 5) is safe but delays scoring. While it centralizes me further, I need to prioritize gaining apples to win.\n- **Enemy Interaction:** Snake #1 is at (5, 1) and is not an immediate threat to the top-left area where I am heading.\n- **Trapping Risk:** Moving UP keeps me near the wall, but since I have a clear path to an apple immediately and there are no obstacles blocking the path to (3, 7), the risk is minimal.\n\n**Long-term Plan**\nMove UP to (3, 6) to prepare to eat the apple at (3, 7) next turn.

Body segments at (3, 7) down to (0, 1).\n*   **Enemy Position:** Head at (7, 2), Body extending down/left.\n*   **Apples:** There is an apple directly above me at (3, 9). The board shows an 'A' at (3, 9). I also see apples at (9, 9), (6, 9), (8, 9).\n\n**Step 1: Evaluate Immediate Moves**\n*   **UP (3, 9):** This is an apple location. If I move here, I grow. I need to check if it's safe (not a wall, not a snake body).\n    *   The board at row 9 shows ` . . . A . . A . A A ` at columns 0-9.\n    *   At (3, 9), there is an `A`. There are no 'T' (tail) or numbers here.\n    *   Enemy #1 is at (7, 2). They are far away.\n    *   Moving UP is safe and gains a point.\n*   **LEFT (2, 8):** The board shows a `.` (empty).\n    *   Adjacent body segments? My body is at (3, 7). (2, 8) is not adjacent to (3, 7) in a way that would hit immediately (it's a diagonal separation). Wait, moving into (2, 8) means my head is at (2, 8) and the body segment behind me is the old head (3, 8). (2, 8) and (3, 8) are adjacent. The body follows the head. But the rule is: \"If your head moves into any snake's body... you die.\" and \"Moving directly backwards... counts as hitting yourself\".\n    *   The cell (2, 8) is empty on the board map. It is not occupied by my current body.\n    *   However, looking at my body list: `[(3, 7), (3, 6)...]`.\n    *   So LEFT to (2, 8) is safe from immediate collision *this turn*.\n*   **RIGHT (4, 8):** The board shows a `.` (empty). Safe.\n*   **DOWN (3, 7):** My body is at (3, 7). This is \"directly backwards\" and hits myself. **DEADLY.**\n\n**Step 2: Strategy and Future Outlook**\nI am currently winning (10 vs 9 apples). The apple at (3, 9) is the closest apple (distance 1).\nIf I move **UP** to (3, 9):\n1.  I eat the apple and grow.\n2.  I will be at (3, 9).\n3.  From (3, 9), I will be at the top row. I can move LEFT to (2, 9) or RIGHT to (4, 9).\n4.  Looking at the apples list: (9, 9), (3, 9), (6, 9), (8, 9).\n    *   From (3, 9), the next closest apple is (6, 9) or (8, 9) or (9, 9).\n    *   The board at row 9 is: ` . . . A . . A . A A `\n    *   Columns: 0(.), 1(.), 2(.), 3(A), 4(.), 5(.), 6(A), 7(.), 8(A), 9(A).\n    *   So there is a cluster of 3 apples at the top right.\n    *   If I move UP to (3, 9), next turn I can go RIGHT towards the cluster.\n\n**Step 3: Comparison with other moves**\n*   If I go LEFT to (2, 8) or RIGHT to (4, 8), I do not score an apple this turn. The apple at (3, 9) is still reachable next turn, but I waste a turn not scoring.\n*   Since I am leading, scoring is good to extend the lead. Also, eating an apple makes my body longer, which is a double-edged sword, but necessary to win.\n*   Is there any danger?\n    *   Enemy #1 is at (7, 2). His body is at (7, 1), (6, 1)...\n    *   He cannot reach me this turn.\n    *   Is there a risk of head-on collision on the *next* turn? Possibly. But currently, (3, 9) is empty.\n    *   Let's verify (3, 9) is not on the enemy's potential path. The enemy is at y=2. He needs 7 moves to reach y=9. He won't be there next turn.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving UP to (3, 9) is safe, scores a point, and positions me to chase the cluster of apples at (9, 9), (8, 9), and (6, 9).\n\nUP",

This is also a safe move.\n\n*   **Apples & Strategy:**\n    *   I am currently on the apple at (3, 9).\n    *   Moving **LEFT** takes me to (2, 9), leaving the apple at (3, 9) for next turn (where my body will have moved, making it safe to eat).\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** takes me to (4, 9), leaving the apple at (3, 9) for next turn.\n    *   There is a cluster of apples to the right: (6,9), (8,9), (9,9).\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** puts me on the path towards the large cluster of apples at the top right (6, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9).\n    *   Moving **LEFT** leads towards (1, 1), which is the only apple currently visible on the left side.\n\n*   **Long-term Plan:**\n    *   *Turn 35 (Current):* Move RIGHT to (4, 9).\n    *   *Turn 36:* The head will be at (5, 9).

The apples at y=9 are the closest high-density target.\n    *   Wait, looking at the \"My last move information\" section provided in the prompt, I see this:\n        **START LAST MOVE PICK**\n        RIGHT\n        **END LAST MOVE PICK**\n    *   And the logic: \"Turn 35 (Current): Move RIGHT to (4, 9).\"\n    *   If the provided prompt says I moved RIGHT to (4, 9) in the \"last move\" (Turn 35), then my current position for Turn 36 must be (5, 9).\n    *   Let's re-read the prompt carefully.\n        \"Turn: 36 / 150\"\n        \"Head: (4, 9)\"\n    *   Wait, there is a contradiction in the prompt's data versus the \"Last Move\" text.\n        *   Current State says: Head is (4, 9).\n        *   Last Move Text says: \"Turn 35 (Current): Move RIGHT to (4, 9).\"\n        *   If I moved to (4, 9) on Turn 35, then on Turn 36 I am at (4, 9).\n        *   The prompt explicitly states: \"Your snake (ID: 0) - Head: (4, 9)\".\n        *   The \"Last Move Rationale\" text is likely a sample of how I should think, or a trace of the previous action that *resulted* in (4, 9). It says \"Turn 35 (Current): Move RIGHT to (4, 9)\". This implies the move *resulted* in being at (4, 9).\n        *   Therefore, I am at (4, 9). The \"Last Move\" text is just context explaining *why* I am here.\n\n    *   Okay, confirming current state:\n        *   Head: (4, 9).\n        *   Body: [(3, 9), ...].\n        *   Board: `9 . . . T 0 . A . A A` (0 is at index 4).\n\n    *   Re-evaluating Moves from (4, 9):\n        *   **RIGHT** to (5, 9): Safe. Leads to apples.\n        *   **DOWN** to (4, 8): Safe (map shows `.`).\n        *   **LEFT** to (3, 9): Crash (Body is there).\n        *   **UP** to (4, 10): Crash (Wall).\n\n    *   I need to decide between DOWN and RIGHT.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** to (5, 9) allows me to eat the apple at (6, 9) next turn.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** to (4, 8) gives me a new route but delays eating the top-row apples.\n    *   Since I am on row 9, and there are apples at (6,9) and (8,9), the shortest path is to go RIGHT.\n\n*   **Safety Check:**\n    *   Enemy at (7, 4). Cannot hit me at (5, 9).\n    *   No self-collision on right or down.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   The prompt's \"Last Move Rationale\" describes a strategy to \"go right to (4, 9) then continue to (5, 9)\" to hit the cluster.\n    *   I am at (4, 9).\n    *   Next logical step in that plan is RIGHT.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (5, 9) to approach the apple cluster at (6, 9), (8, 9), and (9, 9). Avoid moving LEFT (self-collision) or UP (wall). DOWN is safe but moves away from the immediate goal.\n\nRIGHT",

While open space is good, securing points is the priority, especially when the path is clear and the tail is moving out of the way.\n5.  **Safety Check**:\n    *   If I move **RIGHT** to (7, 9), my tail at (0, 3) moves to (0, 4). My body will look like: [(7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), ..., (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 4)]. None of these are at (7, 9) or (6, 9) (which are occupied by head and next segment).

My body occupies (6, 9) through (2, 5) and the left wall down to (0, 4).\n2.  **Immediate Options**:\n    *   **UP**: Invalid (off board).\n    *   **DOWN**: (7, 8). This is currently an apple (`A`). This is a safe move and allows me to grow. It is not occupied by any snake body.\n    *   **LEFT**: (6, 9). This is occupied by my own body. **DEATH**.\n    *   **RIGHT**: (8, 9). This is currently an apple (`A`). This is a safe move and allows me to grow.\n3.  **Enemy Analysis**: Snake #1 is at (6, 5). It is far away and poses no immediate threat to the top row.\n4.  **Apple Strategy**: There are three apples on the top row: (7, 8), (8, 9), and (9, 9). I am currently at (7, 9).\n    *   **Option 1 (RIGHT to 8,9)**: I eat the apple at (8, 9). My tail moves to (0, 5). My head is now (8, 9). For the next turn, I can potentially eat (9, 9) or (7, 9) (which will be empty after my tail moves).\n    *   **Option 2 (DOWN to 7,8)**: I eat the apple at (7, 8). My tail moves to (0, 5). My head is now (7, 8).\n5.  **Long-term Planning**:\n    *   If I move **RIGHT** to (8, 9), I am adjacent to the apple at (9, 9). I also have the apple at (7, 9) behind me (assuming it doesn't get blocked by my own tail). However, if I go RIGHT now, I am trapping myself in the corner (9,9) is the only exit left after that.\n    *   If I move **DOWN** to (7, 8), I eat the apple. On the next turn, I will be at (7, 8). I can then move **RIGHT** to (8, 8), then **RIGHT** to (9, 8), then **UP** to (9, 9). This path secures the (7, 8) apple first, then the (9, 9) apple. It avoids getting stuck in the immediate corner.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate the corner trap. If I move **RIGHT** to (8, 9) -> then **RIGHT** to (9, 9). My head is at (9, 9). Next moves: UP (invalid), RIGHT (invalid), LEFT (8, 9 - might be my body if I just came from there, or empty), DOWN (9, 8). I will have an escape route.\n    *   However, simply moving **DOWN** to (7, 8) feels safer as it keeps me away from the absolute edge wall (9,9) for one more turn. It also leaves the apple at (8, 9) open for a future turn if I loop around, but actually, if I go DOWN now, I can likely still eat (8,9) and (9,9) later.\n    *   Let's look at the sequence:\n        *   **Turn 39 Move: DOWN** (Eat 7,8).\n        *   **Turn 40 Move: RIGHT** (Eat 8,8? No, 8,8 is empty). Wait, if I go DOWN to (7,8), the apples are at (8,9) and (9,9). I am at (7,8). Next turn I can go RIGHT to (8,8) or UP to (7,9). If I go UP to (7,9), I block my own path slightly if I want to go to (8,9).\n        *   Actually, looking at the board, (8,9) and (9,9) are the targets.\n        *   **Path A**: (7,9) -> (8,9) -> (9,9). This eats 2 apples in 2 turns. Ends at (9,9).\n        *   **Path B**: (7,9) -> (7,8) -> (8,8) -> (9,8) -> (9,9). This eats 1 apple (at 7,8) in 1 turn, and 1 apple (at 9,9) in 4 turns.\n    *   Path A seems more efficient for score.\n    *   Let's reconsider safety. If I move **RIGHT** to (8,9), I am safe. If I move **DOWN** to (7,8), I am safe.\n    *   The apples at (8,9) and (9,9) are right there. I should take them.\n    *   I will move **RIGHT** to (8,9). This eats an apple and moves me closer to (9,9).\n\nFinal check for safety of RIGHT to (8,9):\n- Target (8,9): Empty on board (it's an Apple). No snake body.\n- My body: Will be at (7,9), (6,9)... My tail moves to (0,5).\n- Collision check: I will be at (8,9). My body occupies (7,9). I am not hitting myself.\n- Enemy: Snake #1 at (6,6). Safe.\n\nWait, looking at the board again:\n` 9 . . . T T T T 0 A A`\nIndices: 0-9.\nMy head is at index 7 (x=7). Apples are at 8 and 9.\nMoving RIGHT takes me to 8.\nLet's look at the board state provided:\n` 9 . . . T T T T 0 A A`\nMy head '0' is at (7,9).\nApples are at (8,9) and (9,9).\nWait, the prompt says \"Apples at: (9,9), (8,9)...\". The visual board confirms this.\nSo moving RIGHT to (8,9) eats the apple.\nMoving DOWN to (7,8) eats the apple at (7,8) (which is marked 'A' in row 8).\n\nOkay, let's re-read the visual board carefully.\nRow 9: ` . . . T T T T 0 A A`\nLet's map x-coordinates 0-9 to these characters.\nx=0: . (empty)\nx=1: . (empty)\nx=2: . (empty)\nx=3: T (Tail?)\nx=4: T\nx=5: T\nx=6: T\nx=7: 0 (My head)\nx=8: A (Apple)\nx=9: A (Apple)\n\nRow 8: ` . . . T . . . A . .`\nx=7: A (Apple)\nSo apples are at (7,8), (8,9), (9,9).\n\nMy head is at (7,9).\nMoves:\n- RIGHT: (8,9). Apple. Safe.\n- DOWN: (7,8). Apple. Safe.\n\nI previously thought about getting trapped. If I go RIGHT to (8,9), then RIGHT to (9,9), I am at (9,9). Next I can only go LEFT (8,9) or DOWN (9,8). I will be alive.\nIf I go DOWN to (7,8), I have more space, but I am moving away from the (8,9) and (9,9) apples.\nSince I am trying to score points, and the path to (8,9) and (9,9) is clear, I should take the immediate apple at (8,9).\n\nLet's double check the \"Last Move\" info. It says \"Analyzing the current board state and positions... My head is at (6,9)\". But the current prompt says \"Head: (7,9)\". The \"Last Move\" was \"RIGHT\". So I moved from (6,9) to (7,9). That matches.\n\nSo, current state: Head at (7,9).\nMoves:\n- RIGHT -> (8,9). Apple. Safe.\n- DOWN -> (7,8). Apple. Safe.\n- LEFT -> (6,9). Body. Death.\n- UP -> Off board. Death.\n\nI want to eat the apples. (8,9) and (9,9) are adjacent. (7,8) is also adjacent.\nIf I eat (8,9), I am one step closer to (9,9).\nIf I eat (7,8), I have to navigate around to get to (8,9) and (9,9).\nHowever, looking at the top row, if I move RIGHT to (8,9), I am taking the first step in clearing the top row.\nIf I move DOWN to (7,8), I am clearing a lower apple, but opening up the top row.\nWait, there are 3 apples in the top-right corner. I should secure them.\nMove RIGHT to (8,9).\n\nSafety:\n- (8,9) is an apple. Not a wall. Not a snake body.\n- My body follows.\n- Enemy Snake #1 is at (6,6). Far away.\n\nDecision: Move RIGHT.\n\nLong-term plan:\nSecure the apples on the top row (8,9) and (9,9). Then descend into the center to find more apples or grow. Avoid trapping myself against the wall.\n\nMove: RIGHT",

My body stretches down to (2, 5) and then left to (0, 4).\nThe apples on the board are at: (9, 9), (1, 1), (0, 0), (7, 8), (4, 4).\nI am adjacent to the apple at (9, 9). I am also adjacent to (7, 8), but (9, 9) is the most immediate target on the top row.\n\n**Immediate Moves Evaluation**\n*   **UP**: Off board. Invalid.\n*   **RIGHT**: (9, 9). This is an apple (`A`). It is within the board bounds (0-9). It is not occupied by any snake body. **Safe and beneficial.**\n*   **LEFT**: (7, 9). This is currently my own body (the segment behind my head). **Death.**\n*   **DOWN**: (8, 8). The board shows `.` at this position. It is safe, but it doesn't grant a point immediately. However, I must consider if moving to (8, 8) is better than moving to (9, 9).\n\n**Strategy**\nThe goal is to score points and survive.\nI am at (8, 9). The apple at (9, 9) is reachable in one turn.\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (9, 9):\n1. I eat the apple.\n2. My tail moves from (0, 4) to (0, 5).\n3. My new position is head at (9, 9).\n4. Future options: I will be in the corner. I can only move LEFT (back to 8, 9) or DOWN (to 9, 8).\n   *   Moving LEFT back to (8, 9) is dangerous if my tail hasn't cleared it, but since I just moved, the tail will have shifted one step.\n   *   Moving DOWN to (9, 8) seems like the best path forward to loop around towards the center apples at (7, 8) and (4, 4).\n   *   Being in the corner restricts movement, but since I know I have to move DOWN next turn, I can plan for it.\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (8, 8):\n1. I do not eat an apple.\n2. I am safe.\n3. Future options: I can still go RIGHT to (9, 8) or UP to (8, 9) next turn. This seems safer, but I lose the immediate point at (9, 9). However, Snake #1 might move towards that apple if they are close. Snake #1 is currently at (6, 6). They are 5 cells away (Manhattan distance: |6-9| + |6-9| = 3+3=6? No, |6-9| + |6-9| = 3+3=6). Wait, distance to (9,9) is |6-9| + |6-9| = 3+3 = 6. Distance to (7,8) is |6-7| + |6-8| = 1+2=3.\nSnake #1 is closer to (7,8) than (9,9). I am at (8,9). I am adjacent to (9,9). I should take the apple I am touching.\n\n**Safety Check for RIGHT**\nTarget: (9, 9).\n- Is it an apple? Yes.\n- Is it a wall? No (x=9 is valid, y=9 is valid).\n- Is it an enemy snake? No (Snake #1 is at (6,6), body starts at (6,5)).\n- Is it my body? No. My body starts at (7, 9) -> (6, 9)... The cell (9, 9) is empty of my body.\n- *Collision Check*: Simultaneous movement. Snake #1 is at (6,6). He might move towards (7,8). I am moving to (9,9). We are not in conflict.\n\n**Conclusion**\nMoving **RIGHT** secures an apple immediately and pushes me to the next turn where I can navigate down into the board towards the cluster of apples at (7, 8), (4, 4), etc. Avoiding the corner trap is important, but I can easily leave the corner by moving DOWN next turn. Securing the point is the priority.\n\n**Long-term Plan**: Secure the (9,9) apple. Next turn, move DOWN to (9,8) to exit the corner and head towards (7,8). Then target (4,4) or (1,1) depending on Snake #1's position.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "The board state shows my head at (9, 9). My previous turn's move was RIGHT to get to (9, 9) and eat an apple. However, looking at the \"Current Position Analysis\" provided in the prompt, it states: \"I am at (8, 9). My body stretches down to (2, 5) and then left to (0, 4). The apples on the board are at: (9, 9), (1, 1), (0, 0), (7, 8), (4, 4). I am adjacent to the apple at (9, 9).\"\n\nThis confirms that my head is currently at **(8, 9)** and I have not yet moved into (9, 9). The apple at (9, 9) is to my RIGHT.\n\n**Current Position Analysis:**\n*   **Head:** (8, 9)\n*   **Body:** [(7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 4)]\n*   **Apples:** (9, 9) is to the RIGHT. (7, 8) is DOWN-LEFT.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1.  **UP:** (8, 10). Off the board. **DEATH**.\n2.  **RIGHT:** (9, 9).\n    *   **Target:** (9, 9).\n    *   **Contents:** Apple (`A`).\n    *   **Safety:** It is not a wall. It is not my body (my body starts at (7, 9)). It is not Snake #1 (Snake #1 is at (6, 6)). It is safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** Eating the apple puts me at 15 apples (14 + 1). It moves my head to the corner. While corners can be traps, I am currently at (8, 9), which is also near the wall. Getting to (9, 9) secures the point. From (9, 9), I will be forced to move LEFT (back to 8,9) or DOWN (to 9,8). Since I am moving RIGHT now, my tail will move from (0, 4) to (0, 5). The cell (8, 9) will become my neck. If I move LEFT next turn, I would hit my neck. So from (9, 9), I must move DOWN to (9, 8). This is a viable path towards (7, 8).\n3.  **LEFT:** (7, 9).\n    *   **Target:** (7, 9).\n    *   **Contents:** My own body (segment 2).\n    *   **Safety:** **DEATH**. Moving backwards into the body is illegal.\n4.  **DOWN:** (8, 8).\n    *   **Target:** (8, 8).\n    *   **Contents:** Empty (`.`).\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Strategy:** This avoids the corner. It allows me to head towards the center apples. However, I am adjacent to an apple at (9, 9). Leaving an adjacent apple un-eaten is generally poor strategy, especially when it's safe to take. If I don't take it, Snake #1 (currently at (6,6) or moving) might eventually take it, or I might have to go out of my way later.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTaking the apple at (9, 9) via **RIGHT** is the most logical move. It scores a point and keeps me alive. The immediate concern is being trapped in the corner, but since I am forced to move DOWN next turn anyway (LEFT is blocked by my neck), I will end up at (9, 8). From (9, 8), I can turn LEFT towards the center (8, 8 -> 7, 8). This sets me up nicely to chase the apple at (7, 8).\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **RIGHT** to (9, 9) to eat the apple.\n2.  **Next turn:** Move **DOWN** to (9, 8) to avoid the wall/neck trap and enter the board.\n3.  **Following turn:** Move **LEFT** towards (8, 8) and the cluster at (7, 8).\n\nRIGHT",
