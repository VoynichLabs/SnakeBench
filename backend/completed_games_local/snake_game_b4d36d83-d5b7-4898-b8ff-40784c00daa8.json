UP: (7,6) - into my own body (suicide)\n2. DOWN: (7,4)\n3. LEFT: (6,5)\n4. RIGHT: (8,5) - into enemy snake's head (would kill both)\n\nFirst, eliminate unsafe moves:\n- UP is suicide (moving into my own body)\n- RIGHT would cause a head-on collision with the enemy snake\n- DOWN and LEFT are safe\n\nNow let's evaluate the safe moves:\n\nDOWN to (7,4):\n- Moves me toward the apple at (7,3)\n- Keeps me in a vertical line with multiple apples\n- Enemy could move LEFT to (7,5) which would be into my current position (but I'll be at (7,4) by then)\n- Good option for continuing toward apples\n\nLEFT to (6,5):\n- Moves me away from the vertical line of apples\n- Could be a good defensive move to avoid potential enemy aggression\n- Less direct path to apples\n\nConsidering the enemy's possible moves from (8,5):\n- UP: (8,6) - into its own body (suicide)\n- DOWN: (8,4)\n- LEFT: (7,5) - into my current position (but I'll have moved)\n- RIGHT: (9,5) - toward the apple at (9,5)\n\nThe enemy is most likely to move RIGHT toward the apple at (9,5) or DOWN to (8,4).\n\nDOWN to (7,4) seems like the best move because:\n1. It continues my path toward the apple at (7,3)\n2. It keeps me in a good position to potentially reach other apples\n3. It avoids immediate danger\n4. It maintains flexibility for future moves\n\nStrategy note for future: After moving DOWN to (7,4), I'll be one step closer to the apple at (7,3). I should continue moving DOWN to collect that apple, while being aware of the enemy snake's position and potential movements. I should also keep an eye on the apple at (9,5) which the enemy might be targeting.\n\nDOWN",
