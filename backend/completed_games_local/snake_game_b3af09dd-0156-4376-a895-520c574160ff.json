Current position and possible moves**  \nMy head is at (0, 6).  \nPossible moves:  \n- UP: (0, 7)  \n- DOWN: (0, 5)  \n- LEFT: (-1, 6) \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid  \n- RIGHT: (1, 6)  \n\nSo only UP, DOWN, RIGHT are possible without leaving the board.  \n\n**2. Check for collisions with other snakes' bodies**  \nSnake #1 is at (7, 2) with no body yet, so no body collision risk for me anywhere.  \nMy snake has no body yet, so no self-collision risk except moving backwards into the non-existent tail cell (but that\u2019s not relevant here since there\u2019s no body segment yet).  \n\nActually, \"moving directly backwards into your own body\" \u2014 since my snake is only a head, there\u2019s no body behind me yet. But I must check:  \n- If I had a body, the cell behind my head would be the tail. Currently no tail, so no backwards death.  \n\nSo all three moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) are safe from immediate death.  \n\n**3. Apples and future options**  \nApples: (2,5), (4,4), (6,7), (7,3), (8,9)  \n\nClosest apple is (2,5) \u2014 Manhattan distance from my head (0,6) is |2-0| + |5-6| = 2 + 1 = 3.  \n\n- UP (0,7): distance to (2,5) = 2 + 2 = 4  \n- DOWN (0,5): distance to (2,5) = 2 + 0 = 2 (closer)  \n- RIGHT (1,6): distance to (2,5) = 1 + 1 = 2 (same as DOWN)  \n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT both get me equally closer to the nearest apple.  \n\n**4. Future mobility**  \nFrom (0,5): possible moves: UP, RIGHT, LEFT still off board \u2192 only 2 directions unless I go RIGHT first later.  \nFrom (1,6): possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 directions) \u2014 better mobility.  \n\nFrom (0,7): possible moves: DOWN, RIGHT (2 directions) \u2014 worse.  \n\nSo RIGHT gives best immediate mobility (3 options next turn) and equally close to nearest apple as DOWN.  \n\n**5. Enemy snake consideration**  \nSnake #1 at (7,2) \u2014 far away, no immediate collision threat. No head-on risk this turn since I\u2019m moving to (1,6) and enemy is moving from (7,2).  \n\n**Conclusion:** RIGHT is optimal \u2014 closest to apple, best mobility.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move toward (2,5) apple while keeping space to avoid trapping myself near walls.  \n\nRIGHT",

Safe moves are UP to (7,4), LEFT to (6,3), RIGHT to (8,3) \u2013 DOWN is invalid as it moves into my own body. All these moves avoid collision with walls, bodies, or heads (enemy's potential moves don't overlap my chosen cell this turn).\n\nPrioritizing growth and openness: the nearest apples are (4,4) at distance 4, (6,7) at distance 5, with others farther. Last rationale focused on targeting (6,7) next. Moving LEFT to (6,3) directly reduces x-coordinates toward x=6, while staying open (col 6 is mostly empty; I can then move UP multiple times to close y-distance to 7). This keeps multiple options (UP, RIGHT later) and moves me closer to (6,7) without trapping. Moving RIGHT might box me against x=9, and UP stays closer to x=7 but requires another left move to reach x=6. LEFT is slightly preferable for direct progress to the apple while avoiding enemy-side risks.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue toward (6,7) \u2013 after LEFT, move UP from (6,3) to (6,4) or (6,5) next turn to close y-gap, monitoring enemy for potential interception of apples like (2,5) or (3,5). Consider shifting to (4,4) if closer opportunities arise without risk.\n\nLEFT",

Current position and possible moves**  \nMy head is at (1, 6).  \nPossible moves:  \n- UP: (1, 7)  \n- DOWN: (1, 5)  \n- LEFT: (0, 6)  \n- RIGHT: (2, 6)  \n\nAll four moves are on the board.  \n\n**2. Check for collisions with other snakes' bodies**  \nMy snake has no body yet, so no self-collision risk except moving backwards into the non-existent tail cell (but there\u2019s no tail yet, so all moves are safe from self-collision).  \nSnake #1 has body at [(7, 2)], far away from my possible moves.  \nSo no immediate collision risk with any snake body.  \n\n**3. Check for possible head-on collisions**  \nSnake #1 head is at (7, 3) and will move simultaneously.  \nPossible moves for Snake #1: UP (7,4), DOWN (7,2) \u2014 but (7,2) is its own body \u2192 invalid, LEFT (6,3), RIGHT (8,3).  \nNone of these overlap with my possible moves: (1,7), (1,5), (0,6), (2,6).  \nSo no head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n**4. Apples and future options**  \nApples: (2,5), (4,4), (6,7), (8,9), (3,5)  \n\nClosest apple is (2,5) \u2014 Manhattan distance from my head (1,6) is |2-1| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2.  \n\n- UP (1,7): distance to (2,5) = 1 + 2 = 3  \n- DOWN (1,5): distance to (2,5) = 1 + 0 = 1 (closer)  \n- LEFT (0,6): distance to (2,5) = 2 + 1 = 3  \n- RIGHT (2,6): distance to (2,5) = 0 + 1 = 1 (same as DOWN)  \n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT both get me equally closer to the nearest apple.  \n\n**5. Mobility after move**  \nFrom (1,5): possible moves next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 all 4 directions open (good mobility).  \nFrom (2,6): possible moves next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 all 4 directions open (good mobility).  \n\nFrom (1,7): possible moves next turn: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 3 directions (slightly worse).  \nFrom (0,6): possible moves next turn: UP, DOWN, RIGHT \u2014 3 directions (slightly worse).  \n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT are equally good in terms of mobility and apple proximity.  \n\n**6. Tie-breaker**  \nLooking at board:  \n- DOWN (1,5) puts me one step away from apple (2,5) \u2014 next turn I could go RIGHT to (2,5) and eat it.  \n- RIGHT (2,6) puts me one step away from apple (2,5) \u2014 next turn I could go DOWN to (2,5) and eat it.  \n\nBut also note apple at (3,5) \u2014 after eating (2,5), I could continue toward (3,5).  \nFrom (2,5), if I eat apple there, my body will be [(2,5), (2,6)?] Actually no \u2014 after eating, my head moves to apple cell, old head becomes first body segment. So if I go RIGHT then DOWN, my body will be [(2,6)] and head at (2,5). Then next turn from (2,5) I can go LEFT, UP, RIGHT, DOWN \u2014 but LEFT goes to (1,5) which is empty, UP to (2,6) is my body \u2014 so only 3 moves. Similar for DOWN-first path.  \n\nActually, let's check:  \nIf I go DOWN to (1,5): next turn RIGHT to (2,5) eats apple, body becomes [(1,5)], head at (2,5). Then from (2,5) possible moves: UP (body at (1,5)? no, wait \u2014 body is behind me at (1,5), so UP to (2,6) is free, DOWN to (2,4) free, LEFT to (1,5) is body (invalid), RIGHT to (3,5) free \u2192 3 moves.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,6): next turn DOWN to (2,5) eats apple, body becomes [(2,6)], head at (2,5). Then from (2,5) possible moves: UP to (2,6) is body (invalid), DOWN to (2,4) free, LEFT to (1,5) free, RIGHT to (3,5) free \u2192 3 moves.  \n\nSo exactly same future mobility after eating.  \n\n**7. Small preference**  \nGoing DOWN now leaves my head closer to the bottom edge \u2014 but not trapped.  \nGoing RIGHT now keeps me more central.  \nI'll pick RIGHT to stay central slightly.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nEat apple at (2,5) next turn, then likely go toward (3,5) or (4,4) while avoiding Snake #1.  \n\nRIGHT",

Let me parse the board better.\n\nGiven board ASCII:  \nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . 1 \u2192 Snake #1 head at (9, 8).  \nRow 7: . . . . . . . T T T \u2192 tail segments belong to Snake #1 at (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7) maybe reversed? Earlier data said head at (9,8), body: [(9,7), (8,7), (7,7)]. That works: head moved UP from (9,7) to (9,8) last turn, so body now is [(9,7), (8,7), (7,7)].\n\nYes, so Snake #1 length 4 now.\n\n**Step 2 \u2014 Possible moves**  \nFrom (4, 2):  \n- UP: (4, 3) \u2192 free  \n- DOWN: (4, 1) \u2192 free  \n- LEFT: (3, 2) \u2192 free  \n- RIGHT: (5, 2) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Step 3 \u2014 Immediate danger (head-on collision)**  \nSnake #1 head at (9, 8). Distance from me is 5 units away in x,y sum difference = |4-9| + |2-8| = 5+6 = 11 \u2192 no immediate overlap possible.  \nIts possible moves: UP off board invalid, DOWN (9,7) its body invalid, LEFT (8,8) free, RIGHT invalid off board actually x=9, right x=10 invalid. Snake #1 only possible move: LEFT to (8,8). So it will be far from me.  \n\nThus no head-on risk this turn.\n\n**Step 4 \u2014 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (8,9) far, (1,4) far, (5,9) far, (2,4) distance 4, (3,3) distance 2 (Manhattan).  \n\nClosest: (3,3) = 1 up, 1 left from me.  \nTo get (3,3) from (4,2): UP to (4,3), then LEFT to (3,3) next turn. Or LEFT to (3,2), then UP to (3,3).  \n\nSo both UP and LEFT put me closer to (3,3).  \n\nMy body blocks going right to (5,9) etc., so nearest apple is eastgroup: (5,9) but blocked by body.  \n\n(2,4): from (4,2) Manhattan distance 4.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2014 Future mobility after each move**  \nCurrent body: head (4,2), body (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4), (4,5)  \n\nIf UP (4,3):  \n  body becomes [(4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)] since apple not eaten, length same.  \n  From (4,3): moves: UP(4,4) body-blocked, DOWN(4,2) body-blocked, LEFT(3,3) free, RIGHT(5,3) body-blocked \u2192 only 1 safe move next turn \u2014 risky.  \n\nIf DOWN (4,1):  \n  body becomes [(4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]  \n  From (4,1): UP(4,2) body blocked, DOWN(4,0) free, LEFT(3,1) free, RIGHT(5,1) free \u2192 3 safe moves \u2014 better.  \n\nIf LEFT (3,2):  \n  body becomes [(4,2), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (4,4)]  \n  From (3,2): UP(3,3) free, DOWN(3,1) free, LEFT(2,2) free, RIGHT(4,2) body blocked \u2192 3 safe moves \u2014 good.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2014 Avoiding dead ends**  \nUP leads to only 1 option next turn (LEFT to (3,3)). That\u2019s a possible trap if later that space becomes risky. Avoid unless necessary for apple. But (3,3) is apple, so maybe worth it? Wait, eating apple would increase length next turn, altering mobility. Let\u2019s check:  \n\nIf move UP to (4,3) \u2014 no apple. Then next turn move LEFT to (3,3) eats apple then. That yields length 7 but you survive. Still, having only 1 move this turn is dangerous \u2014 if something unexpected happens (like Snake #1 moves toward me), could be trouble. Better to keep options.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2014 Decide**  \nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, UP(risky mobility next turn).  \nBest: DOWN or LEFT both give 3 next-turn options.  \n\nLEFT gets me closer to apple at (3,3)/ (2,4) group.  \nDOWN moves away from apples but safer? Actually DOWN to (4,1) \u2014 nearest apple from there is farther away.  \n\nGiven I have apple lead, maybe prioritize safety with some progress toward apples.  \n\nLEFT: next turn from (3,2) can go UP to (3,3) apple. That\u2019s a clear plan. Seems good.\n\n**Long-term plan note**: After this move, grab (3,3) apple next turn, then consider path to (2,4) or (1,4). Snake #1 is far top-right; keep growing lead.\n\nLEFT",

Avoid prolonged upper-right stays to prevent getting boxed. Continue favoring moves with 2+ safe options and apple proximity while dodging enemy activity.

Let\u2019s verify:  \nFrom (4,3): UP(4,4) body YES blocked, DOWN(4,2) body YES blocked, LEFT(3,3) body YES blocked, RIGHT(5,3) body YES blocked.  \nSo RIGHT is instant death next turn! So RIGHT is bad despite not dying this turn.  \n\nSo RIGHT is unsafe due to inevitable trap (no future moves).

Good.  \n\nUP(3,4):  \nNext turn body = [(3,3),(3,2),(4,2),(5,2),(5,3),(5,4),(4,4)] \u2014 free adjacent cells: UP(3,5) free, DOWN(3,3) body blocked, LEFT(2,4) apple and free, RIGHT(4,4) body blocked.  \nFree moves: UP and LEFT \u2192 2 safe moves. Slightly less mobility than LEFT but can eat apple next turn if choose LEFT.\n\n**Step 5 \u2014 Decision**  \nBoth UP and LEFT are safe with future moves. UP gets me closer to (2,4) directly next move (just go LEFT). Also UP gives access to more open space above.  \n\nUP seems slightly better because going to (3,4) then to (2,4) gets apple while still having escape route upward if needed. LEFT(2,3) also good for apple next turn, but maybe allows less upward mobility (but I can go UP from (2,3) to (2,4) apple next turn too).  \n\nActually:  \nPath: UP(3,4) \u2192 next moves: LEFT(2,4) apple.  \nPath: LEFT(2,3) \u2192 next moves: UP(2,4) apple.  \n\nBoth are symmetric in steps to apple.  \nBut starting with UP puts me at (3,4) with only 2 adjacent free cells next turn, which is riskier if something unexpected happens (snake #1 movement).  \nLEFT(2,3) gives 3 free cells next turn, which is safer.  \nSo I\u2019ll choose LEFT for safety of more options.\n\n**Plan next turns:** After LEFT to (2,3), go UP to (2,4) apple, then decide based on board. Snake #1 far, but watch if it gets close; keep growing and control center.\n\nLEFT",

Not great.\n\nIf LEFT (0,4): new head (0,4), body [(1,4), ...].  \nFrom (0,4): UP(0,5) free, DOWN(0,3) apple free, LEFT invalid (off board), RIGHT(1,4) body blocked \u2192 only 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN)\u2014corner risk: I\u2019m in column 0 with limited sideways movement.\n\nSo UP gives best mobility (3 moves next turn), DOWN and LEFT give 2 moves (but DOWN gets apple adjacency next turn).\n\n**Step 5 \u2014 Apple targeting strategy**  \nApple at (0,3) \u2014 DOWN now gets me closer but not eat yet; next turn LEFT from (1,3) eats it, but mobility low after that corner.  \nApple at (0,8) \u2014 far but possible path: go UP then LEFT along top later.  \nApple at (5,5) \u2014 central, can plan route soon.  \nApple at (0,0) \u2014 bottom left corner, risky long path yields trap possibility.  \nApple at (7,8) \u2014 Snake #1 area, maybe contest later.\n\nBest choice seems go UP to central row 5 or 6 for more options, then maybe LEFT across top to (0,8) apple.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nUP now keeps options open, avoids immediate danger, moves toward center/top region where apples (0,8) and flexibility exist. Avoid bottom-left corner trap. Snake #1 far enough not to interfere short-term.\n\nUP",

No immediate threat to my column5 path\u2014enemy's rightward reach is limited, and head-on unlikely this turn since I'm at (5,8) and they're at (1,5).

Follow with DOWN to (5,6) and (5,5) to eat apple (gaining score to 6), leaving body in column5 for open maneuvers. Monitor enemy\u2014 if they eat (0,3) and start moving right (e.g., toward column6+), consider LEFT at row5 to explore (0,8) via row5->row6+ back to column0, or pursue (7,8) if closer and safe.

UP is suicide due to own body.\n- Enemy head at (1,6); their body congests left/mid-left areas, with head potentially moving LEFT (toward apple at 0,3), DOWN (toward 0,0), RIGHT (toward column boundaries, less likely this turn), or UP (toward row7, no immediate Apple there). No foreseeable head-on collision this turn\u2014enemy's maximum reach is (2,6) if they go RIGHT, which doesn't intersect my safe moves. Their apples: 8 vs. my 5; catching up is priority.\n- Apples: (5,5) is 1 move down from (5,6), unobstructed path. Moving DOWN advances this low-risk grab (eat on next turn, score to 6) without exposure. Other apples like (7,8) at (7,8) risk side detour, and left-side apples (0,0/0,3) invite enemy confrontation. No apples en route except target.\n- Space/paths: Column 5 offers open vertical room (down to row4 empty after eating). Horizontal shifts (LEFT/RIGHT at (5,7)) offer temporary flexibility but deviate from (5,5) without guaranteed apple access, potentially tightening options if enemy pushes right later. Prioritize DOWN for proximity to apple while maintaining lane for quick growth/evasion post-eat.\n- Immediate death avoidance: No off-board, self-hit, or enemy-body risks in safe moves. Future: Stay aware of head-on if enemy zigzags right.\n\n### Strategy for Next 2-3 Turns\n- Move DOWN now to (5,6), then DOWN next to (5,5) for easy apple (gain to 6 apples). Once at (5,5) [assuming no blocks], evaluate: if enemy still left-leaning, consider LEFT via (4,5) toward (0,0/0,3) if path clears (e.g., enemy moves south/down). Otherwise, RIGHT to (6,5) for central access to (7,8) at (7,8) or unexplored right apples. Avoid downward traps in column 5 (enemy body at (5,2) limits extension); use horizon tals to flank for higher density apples. Aim for 8-10 apples by turn ~25-30 to close gap, preferring paths with 2+ exit options. If enemy encroaches column 5 or 6, pivot immediately to left/right escapes.\n\nDOWN",

Other apples: (0,3) and (0,0) risked by enemy proximity; (7,8) to right, longer detour; (0,8) distant and competing with enemy apples.

No head-on or overlap risk this turn; they appear focused leftward toward (0,8)/(0,3). If they eat (0,8), could push further left/down.\n- Apples: (0,0), (0,3) left side (risk enemy proximity; 5-6 moves away, contested); (7,8) upper-right (6+ moves, open but distant); (8,4) mid-right (3 moves to eat via RIGHT-RIGHT-DOWN-RIGHT). (0,8) competing directly with enemy. Prioritize RIGHT path for quick, uncontested eat (no trap; open space post-eat maintains 3+ options vs. left's tighter/occupied paths).\n- Space/paths: RIGHT opens column 6-8 laterally, avoids enemy density. DOWN extends column 5 downward but limits lateral moves immediately. LEFT shifts to column 4, near enemy edges (body at 2-3 rows), potential future congestion as enemy expands. RIGHT offers better long-haul flexibility over down/left.\n- Immediate safety: RIGHT poses zero death risk; post-move, 3 follow-ups (UP to 6,6; DOWN 6,4; RIGHT 7,5\u2014none occupied/focusing away from enemy). Avoids trapping in corners or dead-ends (left side hemmed by board edge/enemy).\n\n### Strategy for Next 2-3 Turns\nMove RIGHT to pursue (8,4) via (6,5) - (7,5) - (7,4) - (8,4) to eat at turn 24, score to 7. Then assess: if (7,8) still there, turn LEFT to (7,7), UP (7,8) if safe, or pursue left apples if not. Monitor enemy, if they encroach right, shift LEFT to (7,4) wait or exit. Try to eat 1-2 per turn cycles 25-35, reaching 10-12 apples. Use growth to occupy key cells post-eats to disincentivize attacks. Target consistent apple capture, aiming to surpass at 50 win (trigger endgame if enemy dies).\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #1 is at center-right area. Apples: (0, 8) is near my head.\n\n**Step 2 \u2014 Immediate safety check from (1, 8)**  \n\nUP (1, 9): within board \u2014 empty. Safe.  \nDOWN (1, 7): my body \u2014 unsafe.  \nLEFT (0, 8): Apple there \u2014 safe (no snake body).  \nRIGHT (2, 8): empty \u2014 safe.  \n\nSo DOWN is blocked. UP, LEFT, RIGHT safe.\n\n**Step 3 \u2014 Enemy movement possibilities**  \n\nSnake #1 head at (5,5):  \nPossible moves: UP (5,6): body \u2014 unsafe. DOWN (5,4): empty. LEFT (4,5): empty. RIGHT (6,5): empty.  \nIt could go for apple (7,8) or (8,4). Possibly DOWN/LEFT to avoid hitting walls.  \nNo direct threat to me right now \u2014 far away.\n\n**Step 4 \u2014 Apple targeting and future mobility**  \n\nBest immediate apple: (0,8) is adjacent LEFT. I can eat it by going LEFT.  \n\nFrom (0,8) after eating: body grows to length 10 next turn, occupying (0,8) as head, old head (1,8) becomes neck, etc.  \nOn the turn after eating apple (0,8):  \nFrom (0,8), safe moves are UP (0,9) and DOWN (0,7) \u2014 but DOWN (0,7) likely safe because my body is shifting. Wait \u2014 after eating, my body: head (0,8), neck (1,8), then (1,7), etc. So (1,8) is body, so going RIGHT from (0,8) next turn is body \u2014 unsafe. So from (0,8), only UP and DOWN work, possibly LEFT too but ( -1 , 8) OOB \u2014 so no LEFT. That\u2019s risky corner.  \n\nGoing LEFT could trap me next turn in corner with only UP and DOWN.  \n\nUP from (1,8) to (1,9): options next turn: LEFT (0,9), RIGHT (2,9) still safe \u2014 good mobility.  \n\nRIGHT from (1,8) to (2,8): opens central space, but moves away from apple (0,8).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2014 Avoiding future dead ends**  \n\nEating apple in corner temporarily traps \u2014 but if I eat it now (LEFT) then next turn choose UP (0,9), then possibly RIGHT to escape. Might be okay. But if I go UP now, then next turn I can go LEFT to (0,9), then maybe even get (0,8) afterward? Actually (0,8) apple is there now so if I don\u2019t eat it now, Snake #1 might come later? Unlikely soon. But safer to eat quickly.  \n\nBut UP now allows eating apple next turn anyway: (1,8) \u2192 (1,9) \u2192 (0,9) \u2192 (0,8) is a detour of 2 moves instead of 1. Let\u2019s check: if I go LEFT now: immediate apple. If I go UP: I still can get apple later, but risk losing it if snake #1\u2019s path changes.  \n\nCheck trap risk: from (0,8) after eating, only UP and DOWN available. That\u2019s risky if something blocks later. Therefore I should eat it only when I have an escape plan \u2014 going UP first to come back down might be safer actually for pathing.  \n\nBut given early game, immediate eating with length 9 seems okay: after eating (0,8), go UP (0,9), then right (1,9), etc., avoiding body.\n\n**Step 6 \u2014 Decision**  \n\nHigh priority: eat apple safely. LEFT is safe this turn and gets apple, boosts score to 9. Escape possible next turn: go UP (0,9) after eating, gives flexibility.  \n\nUP also safe but delays apple. RIGHT safe but moves away from apples.  \n\n**Plan**: Eat apple now with LEFT, then move upward to avoid corner trap.  \n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "### Analysis of Current Position\n- Head at (6,5), body [(5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,9)]. Safe moves: UP to (6,6, empty), DOWN to (6,4, empty), RIGHT to (7,5, empty). LEFT to (5,5) is own body/ suicide.\n- Enemy head at (0,8), safe moves: UP to (0,9, apple) or DOWN to (0,7, empty). No risk of simultaneous head collision this turn (we're on opposite sides); they seem likely to eat (0,9) for +1 point (to 10 totals), then maneuver east from (0,9) via (1,9). Monitor if they shift toward center/right; current trajectory minimizes contestation.\n- Apples: (8,4) is closest/uncontested (2-3 turns away via RIGHT-RIGHT-DOWN; open post-eat with 3+ options like LEFT or UP); (7,8) similar distance (3-4 turns via RIGHT-UP-UP-UP, also open); left-side apples ((0,0), (0,3), (0,9)) are enemy-adjacent/7+ turns away, increasing risk/reward. Prioritize (8,4) for quick, safe point gain (reach 7 apples by turn 23 vs. longer hauls).\n- Space/paths: RIGHT extends into open right side (columns 7-9) with exits; DOWN returns toward center (potential future congestion if enemy expands left); UP is neutral but shorter-term options vs. RIGHT (from (6,6), can't LEFT into body at (5,6), limiting). RIGHT maintains flexibility and apple pursuit outweighs slight enemy proximity risk (they're lagged).\n- Immediate safety: All safe moves keep 3+ follow-ups; RIGHT poses lowest trap risk (opens column 7 vs. tighter center).\n\n### Strategy for Next 2-3 Turns\nContinue RIGHT to (7,5) to eat (8,4) at turn 23 (+1 point), then pivot based on remaining apples/enemy. If (7,8) persists, loop UP via (7,6)-(7,7)-(7,8) post-eat; else track left if safe (avoid (0,9) if enemy eats). Aim for 1-2 eats per 5 turns (target 8-9 apples by 35), outpace enemy (their 10+ soon). Watch for enemy rightward push; use growth to block key spaces.\n\nRIGHT",
