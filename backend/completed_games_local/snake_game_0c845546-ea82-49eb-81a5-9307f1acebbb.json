Who's ready to box the rival in and snag some apples??? \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udc40\n\nQuick state: I'm at (1,2). Opponent head at (3,5). No bodies for either of us \u2014 we're both lone heads. Lots of apples on the board; the immediate tasty one is at (0,2) \u2014 right next to me. Let's break it down.\n\nDecision process (thinking out loud):\n1) Consider all four directions from (1,2):\n   - UP -> (1,3)\n   - DOWN -> (1,1)\n   - LEFT -> (0,2)  \u2190 apple!\n   - RIGHT -> (2,2)\n\n2) Eliminate any immediate-death moves:\n   - None of these moves goes off the board.\n   - Neither snake has a body to run into, and moving into the opponent\u2019s current head cell would only be fatal if we both move into the same spot simultaneously \u2014 that\u2019s not happening here given the distance. So ALL four are safe this turn.\n\n3) Evaluate which keeps options open and moves toward apples:\n   - LEFT to (0,2) immediately eats an apple (+1), giving us lead and making the opponent react. Yes please! \ud83c\udf4f\n   - From (0,2) we still have 3 exits (UP to (0,3), DOWN to (0,1), RIGHT back to (1,2)). Not boxed in yet \u2014 we won\u2019t be stuck in a one-cell dead-end immediately.\n   - UP/DOWN/RIGHT are safe but either pass up an immediate apple or move away from it. Taking free points early is huge for tempo.\n\n4) Head-on collision risk:\n   - Opponent is at (3,5), far away. They cannot contest (0,2) this turn. No simultaneous head-to-head risk this move.\n\nShort plan (for next turns):\n- After grabbing (0,2), prioritize escaping off the edge by circling back toward center (use RIGHT/UP as needed) to chase nearby apples like (2,1) and (2,5) while avoiding getting funneled into corners. Force them toward the denser apple clusters and deny them space. Stay at least one cell away from any direct head-on approach from the opponent.\n\nAlright squad \u2014 let's snatch that apple and pressure them! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

From there, tons of paths open: back DOWN, LEFT/RIGHT across the mid, or UP to chase more top apples. Versatility mode activated, and closer to eating? Hell yeah, that's the pick to fuel OUR growth while that 1's stuck bottom.\n\nWithout eating FIRST? Weak sauce\u2014apples win games, remember? OPPONENT might grab bottom treats, but we're gonna HUNT later. Long-term plan for future me: Gobble this apple, then zig or zag UP/RIGHT towards top row apples ((4,8), (4,9), heck even (6,7)) to rack up points, grow long AF. Then SWOOP DOWN/left to block that 1 at bottom, steal HIS apples ((2,0), (2,1), (1,7)), box him in tight like a noob trap. Plot revenge, stay open\u2014don't get cornered urself, that's EZ kills!

No way. \ud83d\udeab\n- UP -> (0,3): safe, heads toward the top cluster of apples but slower to the nearest bites.\n- DOWN -> (0,1): safe, moves us toward the lower apple cluster (2,1) and (2,0) which are reachable in a few turns.\n\nWhy I pick DOWN:\n- Immediate safety: only UP and DOWN are legal \u2014 LEFT is off-board and RIGHT is suicide into our neck.\n- DOWN gives the shortest route to reachable apples like (2,1) and (2,0) after a quick follow-up RIGHT move. Score early, snowball the pressure. \ud83e\uddca\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83c\udf4f\n- After moving DOWN we\u2019ll still have at least two exits (to (1,1) or (0,0)), so we\u2019re not getting boxed in immediately.

Time to bait and box! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udce6\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Turn 1: DOWN to (0,1).\n- Turn 2: aim RIGHT to (1,1) then to (2,1) to grab that apple, unless the opponent makes a surprising run \u2014 in which case pivot to avoid head-on and keep distance.\n- Midgame: force them into denser apple areas while we control escape routes and avoid tight corners.

Consider all 4 directions:\n- LEFT -> (4,1): illegal (neck/back into our body). \u274c\n- RIGHT -> (6,1): apple! Legal. If we eat, body becomes longer and we\u2019ll have exits: UP (6,2), RIGHT (7,1), DOWN (6,0). \u2705\n- UP -> (5,2): apple! Legal. From there we\u2019ll have exits: UP (5,3), RIGHT (6,2), LEFT (4,2) (down is neck). \u2705\n- DOWN -> (5,0): empty and legal, but not an apple and moves us toward the wall with less reward. \u2705\n\nCollision check: opponent head (1,8) is far away \u2014 no immediate head-on threats. Our own body blocks LEFT only. All other legal moves keep us alive this turn.\n\nWhy I pick UP:\n- UP eats the apple at (5,2) and keeps us centered (good for mobility). After that move we still have 3 safe follow-ups (UP, RIGHT, LEFT) \u2014 maximum flexibility.\n- Staying central lets us contest mid-board apples like (3,3) and (7,4) later and avoid getting funneled along the bottom wall if we chase the right-side corridor (7,0).\n- RIGHT is also an apple and viable, but UP matches our earlier plan to control the lower-middle band and keeps escape options open while building toward a box-in of the rival up top. DOWN is conservative but gives up immediate fruit.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Turn 9 (now): UP to eat (5,2).\n- Turn 10: evaluate neighbors; aim to move toward the cluster around y=3\u20134 (grab (3,3) or (7,4)) while maintaining \u22652 escape routes.\n- Midterm: extend length to control the x=4\u20136 corridor and force opponent to stay up top where they\u2019re cramped.\n\nLET\u2019S SNAG THIS APPLE AND KEEP OPTIONS WIDE \u2014 UP\n\nUP",

Body = [(5,1),(4,1),(4,0),(3,0),(2,0)]. Opponent head is way up at (0,8) \u2014 no immediate head-on threat. Apples nearby: (3,3), (7,4), (6,1), (6,6), (6,7) etc.\n\nConsider all four directions:\n- UP -> (5,3): legal. After moving there our new neck will be (5,2), so legal follow-ups = UP (5,4), LEFT (4,3), RIGHT (6,3) \u2192 3 safe exits. Moves us toward central apples (like (3,3)) and keeps lane control. Good mobility.\n- RIGHT -> (6,2): legal. Next-step exits = UP (6,3), RIGHT (7,2), DOWN (6,1 -> apple) \u2192 3 exits. Aggressive, gets us to the (6,1)/(7,0) corridor quickly and can net apples fast, but nudges us toward the bottom wall and a tighter corridor.\n- LEFT -> (4,2): legal. Next-step exits = LEFT (3,2), UP (4,3) \u2192 only 2 safe exits (DOWN is occupied by our body at (4,1); RIGHT is neck) \u2014 riskier, more likely to get funneled.\n- DOWN -> (5,1): ILLEGAL (that\u2019s our neck / immediate backward move) \u2014 instant death if we tried. \u274c\n\nSo valid choices that keep us alive this turn: UP, RIGHT, LEFT \u2014 with UP and RIGHT offering the most follow-up freedom (3 exits). LEFT reduces escape options and could get us boxed in. DOWN is out.\n\nDecision: I pick UP.\n\nWhy UP?\n- Keeps us central and maximizes flexible follow-ups (3 exits). Central control gives us better long-term access to multiple apples and lets us steer clear of tight bottom-right corridors.\n- Moves us toward the (3,3) apple cluster and preserves room to pivot \u2014 we can threaten multiple apples while avoiding being funneled by the wall or our own body.\n- RIGHT is tempting for a quick apple at (6,1), but it nudges us toward the bottom wall and a narrow corridor; I don\u2019t want to reduce future options when the opponent\u2019s up top and can be boxed later.\n\nShort-term plan (for the next few turns):\n- Turn 10 (now): UP to (5,3) to keep central control.\n- Next turns: evaluate \u2014 head-left slice toward (3,3) if safe, or snake-right to contest (7,4)/(6,6) from a central position. Keep \u22652 escape options and avoid hugging the bottom wall.\n\nLet\u2019s box the rival later \u2014 we keep the middle, stay flexible, and punish any dumb head-charges. LET\u2019S MOVE.\n\nUP",

Closest, highest reward, low risk this turn.\n\nOpponent is in top-left; they can\u2019t contest (3,3) this turn. Eating now increases our lead-chasing potential and keeps options open.

Let\u2019s run the checks.\n\nBoard recap (head = (3,3)). Immediate illegal move: RIGHT -> (4,3) is our neck/backwards = instant death. No backtracking allowed. So candidates: UP=(3,4), DOWN=(3,2), LEFT=(2,3).\n\nQuick threat check: Opponent head at (1,6) is too far to contest any of these cells this turn \u2014 no head-on risk this turn. Good. \ud83d\ude08\n\nMove-by-move:\n- UP -> (3,4)\n  - Cell is empty. After moving there, non-backwards follow-ups = LEFT(2,4), UP(3,5), RIGHT(4,4) \u2192 3+ exits. Keeps central control and gets us closer to the cluster around (2,5) and the top-left where the opponent lives. Safe, flexible, and sets up pressure. \u2705\n- DOWN -> (3,2)\n  - Cell is empty. Follow-ups (excluding backwards) = LEFT(2,2), DOWN(3,1), RIGHT(4,2) \u2192 3 exits. Moves toward lower apples (1,2,6,1) but nudges us away from the opponent and slightly toward tighter real estate. Decent but less aggressive. \ud83e\udd14\n- LEFT -> (2,3)\n  - Cell is empty. Follow-ups = LEFT(1,3), UP(2,4), DOWN(2,2) \u2192 3 exits. Approaches (2,5) quickly and edges toward the opponent\u2019s quadrant \u2014 could be used to box later but also edges us into their neighborhood where they already have body coverage. Riskier for an aggressive trap soon. \ud83d\udd73\ufe0f\n\nWhy UP this turn? We want to keep at least 3 safe exits, stay central, and start applying pressure toward the top-left apples and opponent without committing into their cramped area too early. UP gives the best mix of immediate safety, flexibility, and positioning for mid-game boxing moves. We\u2019re not sprinting for a single apple; we\u2019re positioning to control space and force mistakes. Ready to bait them into the wall! \ud83d\ude0f\ud83c\udfaf\n\nPlan (short-term): Move UP now to (3,4). Next turns, pivot LEFT/UP to contest (2,5) and the 6,x apples while keeping 3+ exits. If opponent hugs the wall, collapse from the right to box them; if they bolt, chase apples and keep central lanes open.\n\nUP",

No way. Don\u2019t be that guy.\n- Candidates: UP=(3,5), LEFT=(2,4), RIGHT=(4,4).\n\nSafety & options:\n- UP -> (3,5): free. Next-turn exits (excluding back) = UP (3,6), LEFT (2,5 apple), RIGHT (4,5) \u2192 3 good exits. Keeps center control and gives access to the nearby apple at (2,5) in one move after, while staying flexible. Opponent at (1,5) cannot reach (3,5) this turn, so no immediate head-on risk.\n- LEFT -> (2,4): free. Next exits = LEFT (1,4), UP (2,5 apple), DOWN (2,3) \u2192 3 exits. Gets us closer to the opponent and the (2,5) apple \u2014 but riskier because it nudges us into their neighborhood and they can already grab (2,5) by moving RIGHT this turn.\n- RIGHT -> (4,4): free but worse long-term. Next exits = RIGHT (5,4), UP (4,5) \u2014 DOWN is blocked by our own body at (4,3). That gives only 2 exits and starts to tighten our mobility. Avoid shrinking options unless we\u2019re forcing a kill.\n\nTactical read: opponent at (1,5) can immediately take (2,5) by moving RIGHT. We can contest later, but fighting for that apple right now would push us closer into their zone and reduce escape leverage. We want space, not a premature cornering. Keep 3+ exits and stay central to be able to collapse on them later or pivot to the big apple cluster if they run.\n\nShort plan (next few turns): Stay central, keep 3+ exits, bait them toward the wall. From UP (3,5) we can pressure left/upper lanes (then swing left to contest (2,5) or curve around to trap them along the x=0 wall). If they bolt, pivot right/up to the dense apples cluster. Don\u2019t give up mobility.\n\nLet\u2019s keep it safe, flexible, and threatening.\n\nUP",

After taking it our safe non-back exits drop and we risk getting crowded.\n- RIGHT = (4,5) is open but leads toward our own tail-block at (4,3) and reduces future mobility fairly quickly.\n- UP = (3,6) is open and gives us the most flexible follow-ups (non-backwards exits: (3,7), (2,6), (4,6)). Keeps center control and lets us pivot to either contest the big cluster on the right or swing left to pressure the rival later.\n\nTactical read:\n- Opponent at (1,4) cannot move UP (that\u2019s their neck), so they can\u2019t immediately head-on us.

UP maintains tempo and threat while keeping our options open.\n\nShort plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Take UP to stay central and keep 3+ exits.\n- If opponent chases (2,5), let them commit and then pivot right/up to cut them off along the top wall \u2014 or rotate clockwise to the dense apples around x=6\u20138 if they back off.\n- Avoid moving into currently occupied opponent body tiles; bait them toward walls, then collapse.\n\nStay flexible, keep space, and force them to make the tight move.\n\nUP",

Never. \ud83d\udc80\n- LEFT = (2,7) heads toward the smaller left corridor and the (2,5) apple. Tempting, but that pushes us toward the opponent\u2019s long left-wall body and reduces escape routes.

Risky now.\n- RIGHT = (4,7) pushes toward the juicy east apples (6\u20138 x) but funnels us into a tighter lane alongside our own torso and potential collisions when we chase that cluster. Viable but more committal.\n- UP = (3,8) is open, preserves the most exits (we can still go L/R/UP next turn), keeps center control, and lets us bait the rival into committing into the left wall so we can cut him off later. Best balance of safety + map control. \u2705\n\nTactical read:\n- Opponent #0 is cramped on the left wall with a long body from y=3..7 and tail curling at x=0; they can go for the (1,1) apple or shuffle, but they\u2019re less mobile than us.\n- East cluster (x=6\u20138) is rich; staying central lets us pivot there or swing left to trap #0 if they overcommit.\n- Preserve space > greedy sprint. We already lead in survival \u2014 keep options open.\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- UP now to maximize exits.\n- If opponent heads deeper into the left wall, pivot LEFT+DOWN to cut them off and contest (2,5) / (1,1).\n- If they retreat or stay, pivot RIGHT toward the east apple cluster and use superior mobility to pick apples safely and then circle back to box them.\n\nLET\u2019S STAY ALIVE, FEED, AND THEN SQUEEZE \u2014 who wants the KO? \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nUP",

RIGHT gives the fastest, safest route to score and maintain multiple exits (we can go up/down from the east corridor).\n\nShort-term plan (next 2\u20134 turns):\n- Sprint RIGHT to (5,8) this turn, then take (6,8) apple next turn. Chain the east apples (6\u20137 columns) to grow and dominate center-right.\n- Once we have length, loop down/right to cut off the left-wall opponent\u2019s escape routes \u2014 they\u2019re already cramped; we can shepherd them into a corner later.\n- Avoid getting trapped on the absolute edge; keep at least two escape options open each step.\n\nWe want apples + space.

Quick, loud brain-dump then the play.\n\nCurrent head: (6,8). Neck: (5,8) \u2192 LEFT is the neck, so LEFT is illegal. No doubt. \u274c\n\nEvaluate remaining moves:\n- UP -> (6,9): on-board and empty, but hugs the top edge and reduces follow-up freedom. Risky for chaining apples. \ud83e\uddf1\n- RIGHT -> (7,8): empty and safe this turn, moves us toward east apples, keeps options open. Good, but misses the immediate apple under us. \u27a1\ufe0f\n- DOWN -> (6,7): apple at (6,7) \u2014 immediate +1, safe (opponent head at (4,1) is nowhere near), and it opens the apple-chain to (6,6) next. Also gives us room to sweep right afterwards. \ud83c\udf4e\u2705\n\nCollision risk check: Opponent #0 head at (4,1) cannot reach any of these target cells this turn, so no head-on danger this move.\n\nTactical choice: TAKE THE APPLE. DOWN gets us (6,7) now, starts a reliable chain into (6,6) next turn, grows our length (more leverage to box the left-wall opponent later), and still leaves multiple escape options (we can swing right or back up after eating if needed). Eat now, dominate later. Who\u2019s gonna stop us? \ud83d\ude24\n\nShort-term plan (for next 3\u20136 turns):\n- Eat (6,7) now, follow to (6,6) to chain.\n- Use extra length to loop right/down, control the center-right corridor, then start hemming the left-wall snake into x\u22641 when safe.\n- Always keep two exits while closing in \u2014 avoid getting pinned on the edge.\n\nLet's munch.

Immediate two-turn apple chain = FAST growth and point.\n\nCollision/contest check:\n- Opponent head (7,1) is far; they can\u2019t contest (7,4) before we get there (we reach in 2 turns, they need 3+). No risky head-on expected this turn.\n- All three legal moves keep us alive this turn. We should favor a line that both scores reliably and preserves escape options.\n\nWhy I pick DOWN:\n- Going DOWN to (7,5) gives a guaranteed path to the apple at (7,4) next turn \u2014 quick points and growth. \ud83c\udf4f\n- From (7,5) we\u2019ll still have multiple exits (LEFT to (6,5), RIGHT to (8,5), or DOWN into the apple). That keeps us flexible and not trapped.\n- Grabbing (7,4) next turn lets us pivot toward nearby apples like (6,3) or swing back right to (8,4)/(9,5) while our extra length helps control space.\n- Long-term: eat (7,4), then pressure the lower corridor to try to shepherd the rival into x\u22641 funnel, avoid head-on fights, and always keep \u22652 escape routes.\n\nShort-term plan (next 3\u20136 turns):\n1) DOWN now to (7,5).\n2) Next turn DOWN to grab (7,4).\n3) After eating, pivot toward (6,3) or (8,4)/(9,5) depending on how the opponent moves; keep forcing them left into the narrow funnel while we control the center-right.\n\nLet\u2019s cash that apple and keep the squeeze going.

Let\u2019s break it down fast and loud. \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nQuick legal sweep from our head (8,4):\n- LEFT -> (7,4) is our neck (backwards) = insta-death. \u274c\n- UP -> (8,5) is open. \u2705\n- RIGHT -> (9,4) is open and gives fastest path to the apple at (9,5). \u2705\n- DOWN -> (8,3) is open. \u2705\n\nThreat & timing check on Snake #0 (head at 9,2):\n- They can only go UP or LEFT this turn. They cannot reach (9,4) or (9,5) this turn, so no immediate head-to-head if we go RIGHT.\n- If we go RIGHT -> (9,4) this turn, next turn we can go UP to (9,5) and eat the apple before #0 can contest it. Swapping into vacated cells by simultaneous movement is safe here.\n\nWhy RIGHT is best:\n- Immediate tempo: moves us one step closer to the apple at (9,5) and sets up eating it next turn. Apples = score + growth = more boxing power. \ud83c\udf4f\n- Keeps at least two follow-up exits next turn (UP or LEFT after arriving at 9,4), so we\u2019re not boxed into a one-move dead end immediately.\n- Puts pressure on the right edge and lets us use our extra length to herd #0 leftwards while they\u2019re stuck along row1 columns \u2014 perfect setup to corner them later.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns):\n1) RIGHT to (9,4) now.\n2) UP next turn to (9,5) and eat the apple.\n3) After eating, maintain mobility (avoid getting pinned on the top-right corner). Use length to compress #0 toward x \u2264 1 and take remaining nearby apples.\n\nWe do this loud, we do this smart \u2014 LET\u2019S box him in and finish strong.

Let\u2019s break it down quick and loud:\n\nLegal moves from head (9,6):\n- RIGHT \u2192 x=10 off the board = DEATH. \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,5) is our neck = illegal/backwards = instant-death. \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,6) \u2014 legal, leads to (8,7) apple next turn but sits next to our own body at (7,6) and has a dangerous corridor at (8,5) (left & down blocked by our body). Risky for getting boxed. \u26a0\ufe0f\n- UP \u2192 (9,7) \u2014 legal, gives at least two safe follow-ups: UP to (9,8) or LEFT to (8,7) (apple). Keeps more options open and avoids immediate corridor traps. \u2705\n\nEnemy threat check: Snake #0 is down around y=1\u20132 \u2014 no head-on collision risk this turn. We\u2019re free to prioritize space and apples.\n\nWhy I PICK UP:\n- Keeps multiple escape routes (not pinned to a one-way corridor). \ud83e\udded\n- Allows a clean approach to apple at (8,7) from a safer angle, or to push further up toward (5,9). \ud83c\udf4e\n- Avoids stepping into the 8,5 corridor that would reduce our mobility and make us easy to box later. \ud83e\udea4\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n1) UP now to (9,7) \u2014 maintain flexibility. \u2b06\ufe0f\n2) Next turn take LEFT to (8,7) to grab that apple if it\u2019s still there, or go UP to (9,8) to keep space. \ud83c\udf4f\n3) After apples, use our length to compress the right side (x=7..9), herd #0 toward the low columns, and NEVER allow ourselves to be funneled into single-cell corridors (especially around x=8,y=5). Trap him, don\u2019t get trapped. \ud83d\ude08\n\nWe stay alive, we farm apples, we box later. LET\u2019S GO! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

No immediate head-on threat to 7,8 or 8,9 this turn. Moving into (7,8) is safe vs opponents.\n\nDecision rationale (short): We want apples and mobility. LEFT immediately secures the apple at (7,8) (pushes our score to 15) while leaving two escape options (up or down) \u2014 that\u2019s both CONTENT and flexibility. UP is tempting to control the top band, but grabbing the apple now is higher value and still keeps us able to move onto the top row next turn if we choose. Let\u2019s cash the apple and keep options open for sweeping the top and then compressing the right side to box #0.\n\nShort long-term plan (next few turns):\n1) LEFT now to pick (7,8). Grow to 15.  \n2) From (7,8) prefer UP to (7,9) if safe, then sweep left toward (5,9) / (0,9) to bulk up.  \n3) With extra length, fold down along x=7..9 to herd/oppress #0 and close the trap on the low bands.

No realistic simultaneous head collision this turn if we go up.\n\nWhy UP is best: it keeps multiple escape options, lets us access the top-row apples (5,9 then 0,9) to grow more safely, and avoids walking into a trap or our own body. DOWN would immediately reduce our degrees of freedom and likely force a collision soon. Stay alive, collect content, keep options \u2014 that\u2019s the move.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n1) UP into (7,9) now.  \n2) Sweep left along y=9 toward (5,9) then (0,9) to bulk up safely.  \n3) With extra length, pressure the right/upper quadrant and look to fold down later to hem in opponents \u2014 but only when we have safe corridors.

Instant death. \u274c  \n- DOWN -> (7,8) = our neck (moving backwards). Illegal. \u274c  \n- RIGHT -> (8,9) = open this turn, but (8,8) below is our body so your follow-up options are VERY limited (you'd be forced along the right edge and toward our own segments).

Safe to be aggressive on top.\n\nWhy LEFT is best:\n- Gets us onto the top-row apples (5,9 then 0,9) for quick growth (CONTENT!!).  \n- Keeps more lateral freedom across the top rather than forcing us down into our own body on the right edge.  \n- Low immediate collision risk; lets us expand length before we start folding back and boxing opponents.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n1) LEFT into (6,9) now.  \n2) LEFT into (5,9) to eat that apple, then sweep left toward (0,9).  \n3) With extra length, force a controlled fold down later to hem in opponents \u2014 but only when corridors are safe.
