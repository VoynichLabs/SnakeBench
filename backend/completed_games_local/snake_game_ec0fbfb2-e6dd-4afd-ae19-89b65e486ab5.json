This is safe.\n- **DOWN** (1, 7): Moves to an empty cell. This is safe.\n- **LEFT** (0, 8): Moves to an empty cell. This is safe.\n- **RIGHT** (2, 8): This is a collision with my own body segment. **This move is fatal.**\n\nThus, the valid moves are: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### Evaluating Safe Moves\n\n1. **UP** to (1, 9):\n   - Collects an apple (+1 point).\n   - New head at (1, 9), body extends from (1, 8) to (2, 8).\n   - Next turn, I will have more options to move away from the wall.\n   - Distance to nearest other apple (4, 8) is 3 steps (R, R, D or similar).\n   - This move is positive in two ways: gains a point and moves away from a potential trap against the top wall.\n\n2. **DOWN** to (1, 7):\n   - Moves to an empty space.\n   - Opens up space below (y decreases), but moves me away from all apples.\n   - Next viable apple is at (4, 6), which is 4 steps away.\n   - This move is safe, but potentially suboptimal as it moves me further from apples.\n\n3. **LEFT** to (0, 8):\n   - Moves to an empty space.\n   - Puts me against the left wall (x=0), which limits future options.\n   - Next turn I can only move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n   - This move is safe but restrictive.\n\n### Considering Enemy Snake Movement\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2, 3). Its possible moves (assuming no immediate self-collision) are:\n\n- UP to (2, 4)\n- DOWN to (2, 2)\n- LEFT to (1, 3)\n- RIGHT to (3, 3)\n\nAll of these are safe and far from my current position, so no immediate head-on collision is expected.\n\n### Strategy Note (For My Future Self)\n\nMy priority is to collect apples while maintaining mobility. Moving UP to (1, 9) gains an apple and moves me into a less restrictive area of the board. This is preferable to moving DOWN or LEFT, which takes me away from apples or into a corner.\n\n### Final Decision\n\nUP",

Moving UP brings me closer to the upper rows where the apples are clustered, maintains my position in a column (x=2) that is clear of enemy body segments, and preserves all four directional options for future turns.\n\n**Plan**: Continue moving UP for the next 2 turns to reach (2,6) as previously planned. This vertical progression positions me optimally to turn RIGHT toward the apple at (4,6) while staying well clear of the enemy snake's body in rows 8-9. From (2,6), I can reach (4,6) in 2 additional moves (RIGHT, RIGHT). If the enemy snake interferes with that path or the apple is taken, I will be perfectly positioned to pivot toward alternative targets like (5,7) or (4,8) while maintaining safe distance from the enemy's territory.\n\nUP",
