I should prioritize moving towards the nearest available apple that is safe.\n\nMy head is at (7, 6).\nPossible moves and their resulting coordinates:\n1. UP: (7, 7) - Apple at (7, 7) is not listed, but (8, 7) and (7, 8) are nearby. Checking the board representation:\n   (7, 7) is empty.\n2. DOWN: (7, 5) - Apple at (7, 5). This is a direct immediate apple.\n3. LEFT: (6, 6) - Empty.\n4. RIGHT: (8, 6) - Apple at (8, 6). This is also a direct immediate apple.\n\nI have two immediate apple options: DOWN to (7, 5) or RIGHT to (8, 6).\n\nLet's check for collisions with Snake #0. Snake #0 is at (7, 3).\nSnake #0's potential moves:\nUP: (7, 4)\nDOWN: (7, 2)\nLEFT: (6, 3)\nRIGHT: (8, 3)\n\nThe closest movement of Snake #0 to me is if it moves UP to (7, 4). This is still 1 unit away from my potential move to (7, 5) or (8, 6). There is no risk of immediate collision with Snake #0's head since we are far apart.\n\nComparing DOWN to (7, 5) and RIGHT to (8, 6):\nBoth moves yield an apple and are safe.\n(7, 5) is surrounded by apples: (8, 5) to the right, (7, 8) and (8, 7)/(8, 8) above.\n(8, 6) is surrounded by apples: (8, 5) down, (8, 7)/(8, 8) up.\nBoth seem strategically good.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 5):\nApples nearby: (7, 5) (eaten), (8, 5), (8, 6), (7, 8), (8, 7), (8, 8).\nThis keeps me in a central-right path.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 6):\nApples nearby: (8, 6) (eaten), (8, 5), (7, 5), (8, 7), (8, 8).\nThis pushes me further right, towards the dense apple cluster on the 8th column.\n\nThe cluster seems slightly denser and higher up on the right side.\n(8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 1), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 3) are all on the right columns (x>=8).\n(7, 6), (7, 5), (7, 8), (7, 9) are on x=7.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 6), I place myself directly in the x=8 column cluster.\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 5), I am between x=7 and x=8 columns.\n\nLet's choose RIGHT to (8, 6). It puts me in the heart of a good cluster of apples, and gives clear access to (8, 7) or (8, 5) next turn, depending on where I want to go.\n\nCurrent board state visualization (A=Apple, 1=My head, 0=Enemy head):\n 9 . . . . . . .

Score: 0 apples.\nBoard size: 10x10 (0-9).\n\nApples remaining: (8, 1), (2, 6), (2, 7), (4, 3), (1, 2), (4, 7), (3, 3), (3, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), (2, 1), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (9, 8), (1, 1), (9, 3), (7, 9), (2, 8), (4, 6).\n\nMy head is at $H=(8, 6)$. My body occupies $B=[(7, 6)]$.\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **UP (8, 7):**\n    *   On board: (8, 7) is on the board.\n    *   Collision with self: No. (7, 6) is the only body segment.\n    *   Collision with enemy body: Snake #0 is length 1 at (7, 2). No collision.\n    *   Is (8, 7) an apple? Yes.\n    *   Status: SAFE and GETS APPLE.\n\n*   **DOWN (8, 5):**\n    *   On board: (8, 5) is on the board.\n    *   Collision with self: No.\n    *   Collision with enemy body: No.\n    *   Is (8, 5) an apple? Yes.\n    *   Status: SAFE and GETS APPLE.\n\n*   **LEFT (7, 6):**\n    *   Collision with self: Yes, this is my body segmentation (tail of the previous turn). Moving into (7, 6) is fatal (moving directly onto the cell immediately behind the head).\n    *   Status: FATAL.\n\n*   **RIGHT (9, 6):**\n    *   On board: (9, 6) is on the board.\n    *   Collision with self/enemy body: No.\n    *   Is (9, 6) an apple? No.\n    *   Status: SAFE but NO APPLE.\n\n**2. Analyze Head-to-Head Collision Risks:**\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at $E_H=(7, 2)$. The enemy is quite far away.\nMy safe moves are (8, 7), (8, 5), and (9, 6).\nThe closest the enemy could get in one move is (7, 3), (7, 1), (6, 2), or (8, 2). All are at least 3 units away from my potential positions. No immediate head-to-head risk.\n\n**3. Evaluate Apple-Gathering Moves (UP vs DOWN):**\n\nBoth UP to (8, 7) and DOWN to (8, 5) result in eating an apple and increasing my length. I need to choose the move that sets me up better for future turns in this dense right-side cluster.\n\n*   **If UP to (8, 7):**\n    *   I eat the apple.\n    *   Next potential apples nearby: (8, 8), (7, 8), (9, 8), (7, 9).\n    *   This keeps me moving upwards towards the top right corner, which has a dense concentration of apples: (8, 8), (9, 8), (7, 9).\n\n*   **If DOWN to (8, 5):**\n    *   I eat the apple.\n    *   Next potential apples nearby: (7, 5) (1 unit left), (8, 1) (4 units down). The density decreases quickly going down the board, although (9, 3) and (8, 1) are present.\n\nThe density of apples seems higher and safer going UP into the top portion of the board (y>6). Moving UP towards (8, 7) and then (8, 8) or (9, 8) seems like the best path to maximize apple yield quickly.\n\n**4. Strategic Choice:**\n\nI will choose UP to (8, 7). This maximizes immediate gain and future access to the largest apple cluster.\n\n**Long-term strategy note for next turn:**\nI should continue moving along the cluster of apples around x=8, y>=7, aiming for (8, 8) or (9, 8) next, depending on availability and preventing trapping. Enemy remains far away, focus on efficient apple collection.\n\nUP",

No.\n    *   Status: SAFE.\n\nSafe Moves: UP (Apples), LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Determine Potential Enemy Moves (Enemy Head 8, 2):**\n\nThe enemy snake #0 is very short and far away, currently at (8, 2). Possible moves:\n*   UP: (8, 3) - No apple.\n*   DOWN: (8, 1) - APPLE.\n*   LEFT: (7, 2) - No apple.\n*   RIGHT: (9, 2) - No apple.\n\nThe enemy will likely target (8, 1) if they are playing optimally, or potentially move towards the center/left where other apples are located (e.g., (2, 1), (2, 6)). Given their position, they pose no immediate threat. The closest they can get to my position (8, 7) is 3 units away (e.g., (8, 3) or (7, 2), depending on subsequent moves).\n\n**3. Evaluate Apple-Gathering Moves & Future Positioning:**\n\nThe clear best move is **UP to (8, 8)**, which captures another apple.\n\n*   $H_{new}=(8, 8)$. Body will be $[(8, 7), (8, 6)]$ (Tail at (8, 6) because we grew).\n\nAfter moving UP, I am in a very strong position within the densely packed corner.\nNext potential apples nearby: (7, 8), (9, 8), (7, 9).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 7) or RIGHT to (9, 7), I miss an immediate apple and allow the enemy to catch up in score/length, although the density is still high around me. Since UP is safe and leads to an apple, it is the optimal choice.\n\n**4. Strategic Choice:**\n\nMove UP to consume the apple at (8, 8) and secure position in the high-density apple area.\n\n**Long-term strategy note for next turn:**\nContinue moving in the top-right cluster. After (8, 8), target (9, 8) or (7, 8)/(7, 9), depending on which path keeps more options open and avoids tight turns near my own growing body. If I move to (8, 8) this turn, next I might aim for (9, 8) (RIGHT) or (7, 8) (LEFT) or (8, 9) (UP). (8, 9) is an apple. The best options are (8, 9), (9, 8), or (7, 8).\n\nUP",

Yes.\n    *   Status: SAFE and GETS APPLE.\n\nSafe Moves: UP, LEFT (Apple), RIGHT (Apple).\n\n**2. Evaluate Apple-Gathering & Positional Moves:**\n\nI have two immediate apple options: LEFT to (7, 8) and RIGHT to (9, 8).\n\n*   **Option A: Move LEFT to (7, 8).**\n    *   Gains an apple. New Head: (7, 8). Body: [(8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6)].\n    *   This moves me towards the high-density area slightly to the west (near 7, 9 and 6, 9 if I continue up).\n    *   Next potential targets: (7, 9) (Apple) or (6, 8) (Empty).\n\n*   **Option B: Move RIGHT to (9, 8).**\n    *   Gains an apple. New Head: (9, 8). Body: [(8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6)].\n    *   This moves me into the absolute corner.\n    *   Next potential targets: (9, 9) (Apple) or (9, 7) (Empty) or (8, 8) (Body segment). Moving to (9, 9) leaves little room for maneuver afterward.\n\n*   **Option C: Move UP to (8, 9).**\n    *   No apple. New Head: (8, 9).\n    *   Next potential targets: (7, 9) (Apple) or (9, 9) (Apple). This is a good maneuvering move if I wanted to potentially contest both (7, 9) and (9, 9) next turn, but sacrificing an immediate apple seems suboptimal when two are available.\n\n**Comparison of LEFT vs RIGHT:**\nBoth moves acquire an apple, leading to length 5 and score 4. I must consider immediate successor moves and openness.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (9, 8)**:\n*   Next turn: Head is (9, 8).\n    *   UP to (9, 9): Apple. Excellent.\n    *   LEFT to (8, 8): Collision with body (Head was (8, 8), now it's segment 2). FATAL.\n    *   DOWN to (9, 7): Safe, empty.\n    *   I'd be cornered, forced to go UP next for the apple, then likely DOWN or LEFT.\n\nIf I move **LEFT to (7, 8)**:\n*   Next turn: Head is (7, 8).\n    *   UP to (7, 9): Apple. Excellent.\n    *   LEFT to (6, 8): Safe, empty.\n    *   DOWN to (7, 7): Safe, empty.\n    *   RIGHT to (8, 8): Collision with body. FATAL.\n    *   This position (7, 8) gives slightly better centrality to the upper apple cluster, with (6, 9) also nearby, and keeps the path open towards the center of the board if needed, whereas (9, 8) traps me in the top-right corner.\n\nBoth directions are optimal for the immediate turn (gaining an apple). Since LEFT (7, 8) offers marginally better positional flexibility for continued apple gathering (accessing the (6, 9) and (7, 9) area), I will choose LEFT.\n\n**3. Enemy Snake Assessment:**\nEnemy Snake #0 is at (8, 1). Last turn, they were at (8, 2). Since they now have 1 apple, they must have eaten (8, 1) this turn. Their head is now (8, 1) and body (8, 2) is a mistake in my reading or the provided game state.\n\nRereading the current state:\nEnemy Snake #0 - Head: (8, 1), Body: [(8, 2)], Apples: 1.\nIf their head was (8, 2) last turn (T=2), and they moved DOWN to (8, 1) this turn (T=3), and (8, 1) was an apple *last turn* (based on my T=2 rationale), then they ate it. Their current state shows they are length 2 (Head (8, 1), Body (8, 2)) and have 1 apple. This confirms they moved DOWN and ate the apple at (8, 1).\n\nTheir current objective will likely be (9, 0) or (7, 2) or (2, 1). They are far away and pose no collision threat. My focus remains on maximizing my apple collection and maintaining flexibility in the top-right quadrant.\n\n**4. Strategic Choice:**\nMove LEFT to (7, 8) to secure an apple and maintain high positional flexibility in the apple-rich upper quadrant.\n\nLong-term strategy note for next turn:\nAfter moving LEFT to (7, 8), I aim for (7, 9) (Apple) or (6, 9) (Apple), depending on visibility and whether (7, 9) still exists. (7, 9) is on the list, so I should aim UP next.\n\nLEFT",

My snake is now length 5. The tail will be removed from the body list *unless* I eat an apple this turn. The tail's current position is (7, 6). If I don't eat an apple, (7, 6) becomes open.\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head 7, 8):**\n\n*   **Obstacles to avoid:**\n    *   Fences (0-9 range)\n    *   My Body: $\\{(8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6)\\}$\n    *   Enemy Body: $\\{(8, 1)\\}$\n    *   Enemy Head (Collision risk): (9, 1). E0 is far away, so head-on collision is negligible.\n\n*   **UP (7, 9):**\n    *   On board: Yes.\n    *   Collision with body: No.\n    *   Apple at (7, 9)? Yes.\n    *   Status: SAFE and GETS APPLE. (Tail moves off (7, 6); Head at (7, 9), Body starts (7, 8), ..., (8, 6))\n\n*   **DOWN (7, 7):**\n    *   On board: Yes.\n    *   Collision with body: No.\n    *   Apple at (7, 7)? No.\n    *   Status: SAFE.\n\n*   **LEFT (6, 8):**\n    *   On board: Yes.\n    *   Collision with body: No.\n    *   Apple at (6, 8)? No.\n    *   Status: SAFE.\n\n*   **RIGHT (8, 8):**\n    *   Collision with self: Yes, (8, 8) is the segment immediately behind the head.\n    *   Status: FATAL.\n\nSafe Moves: UP (Apple), DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Apple-Gathering & Positional Moves:**\n\nThe immediate target is **UP to (7, 9)**, which provides an apple.\n\n*   **Option A: Move UP to (7, 9).**\n    *   Gains an apple. New Head: (7, 9). Length 6.\n    *   This keeps me in the apple-rich top corner and puts me very close to another apple at (6, 9) and (9, 9) (which is currently empty, but (9, 8) is an apple).\n    *   Next potential move analysis (assuming UP): Head (7, 9). Body starts (7, 8).\n        *   UP (7, 10): Off board. FATAL.\n        *   DOWN (7, 8): Collision with body. FATAL.\n        *   LEFT (6, 9): Apple! Highly desirable.\n        *   RIGHT (8, 9): Safe, empty.\n\n*   **Option B: Move LEFT to (6, 8).**\n    *   No apple. New Head: (6, 8). Tail opens up (7, 6).\n    *   This positions me for (6, 9) next turn.\n    *   Next potential move analysis (assuming LEFT): Head (6, 8). Body starts (7, 8).\n        *   UP (6, 9): Apple! Highly desirable.\n        *   LEFT (5, 8): Safe, empty.\n\n*   **Option C: Move DOWN to (7, 7).**\n    *   No apple. Retreats from upper cluster. Less desirable.\n\n**Comparison:**\nMoving UP gives me an apple immediately (7, 9), and then L(6, 9) is still available for the following turn. This is the optimal path for apple maximization and aggressive positioning.\n\nIf I move UP to (7, 9):\n1. T=4: Head (7, 9), Apple, Score 5.\n2. T=5: Head (6, 9), Apple, Score 6.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 8):\n1. T=4: Head (6, 8), Empty, Score 4.\n2. T=5: Head (6, 9), Apple, Score 5.\n\nMoving UP is clearly superior.\n\n**3. Enemy Snake Assessment:**\nSnake 0 is at (9, 1). They are likely heading for (9, 0) (Apple) or maybe moving towards the center/left low area. They are too far away for their movement to influence my choice in the top right quadrant.\n\n**4. Strategic Choice:**\nMove UP to (7, 9) to secure the apple and prime the snake for the adjacent apple at (6, 9).\n\n**Long-term strategy note for next turn:**\nAfter eating (7, 9), the best follow-up is LEFT to (6, 9) to secure another apple, unless an unexpected collision risk appears.\n\nUP",

The current tail is (7, 6). If I do not eat an apple this turn, (7, 6) becomes open.\n\n**2. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head 7, 9)**\n\n*   **Obstacles (Walls, My Body, Enemy Body, Enemy Head):**\n    *   Walls: x < 0, x > 9, y < 0, y > 9.\n    *   My Body: $\\{(7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6)\\}$\n    *   Enemy Head (current): (9, 2).

No.\n    *   Status: SAFE.\n\nSafe Moves: LEFT (Apple), RIGHT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves & Optimal Strategy**\n\nThe goal remains apple maximization.\n\n*   **Option A: Move LEFT to (6, 9).**\n    *   Gains an apple. New Head: (6, 9). Length 7. Score 6.\n    *   This is highly desirable as it secures an immediate point and continues clearing the top edge.\n    *   Current location: (6, 9). Next safe moves: UP (6, 10 - FATAL), DOWN (6, 8 - Safe), LEFT (5, 9 - Safe), RIGHT (7, 9 - Collision with body).\n    *   If I move LEFT, my snake is well-positioned, and still has room to maneuver slightly down into the 8th row (e.g., (6, 8), (5, 8)).\n\n*   **Option B: Move RIGHT to (8, 9).**\n    *   No apple. New Head: (8, 9). Length 6.\n    *   This moves me toward (9, 8) (apple) and (9, 7) (apple).\n    *   However, it ignores the immediate apple at (6, 9).\n    *   Current location: (8, 9). Next safe moves: UP (8, 10 - FATAL), DOWN (8, 8 - Collision), LEFT (7, 9 - Collision), RIGHT (9, 9 - Safe).\n    *   Moving Right puts me in a cramped position next turn: I can only move to (9, 9) (empty) or possibly risk a turn around if (8, 8) opens up (which it won't). This is poor positional choice compared to LEFT.\n\n**4. Enemy Proximity/Danger Assessment**\n\nEnemy 0 is at (9, 2). They moved from (9, 1) to (9, 2) last turn (UP).\nPossible E0 moves this turn:\n1. UP: (9, 3) (Apple!) -> Highly likely.\n2. DOWN: (9, 1) (Safe, empty).\n3. LEFT: (8, 2) (Safe, empty).\n4. RIGHT: (10, 2) (FATAL).\n\nIf E0 moves to (9, 3), they are still far from me. There is no immediate collision risk whether I move LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nMoving LEFT to (6, 9) is the only move that secures an apple this turn. It also sets up a safe position for continued exploration of the top edge.\n\n**Long-term strategy note for next turn (Turn 6):**\nAfter eating (6, 9), the snake is long (length 7) and occupies the top left corner. Head will be (6, 9).\nOptions will include DOWN to (6, 8) or LEFT to (5, 9).\nIf I move DOWN (6, 8), the subsequent moves would likely involve moving LEFT into the (5, X) or (4, X) columns to attack the cluster of apples around (4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 3), and (3, 4), (3, 3).\nThe apple at (9, 8) and (9, 7) is currently far across the map.\n\nLEFT",

The tail (7, 6) remains stationary.\n\n**2. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head 6, 9)**\n\n*   **Obstacles (Walls, My Body, Enemy Body/Head):**\n    *   Walls: x < 0, x > 9, y < 0, y > 9.\n    *   My Body: $\\{(7, 9), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6)\\}$\n    *   Enemy Head: (9, 3).\n    *   Enemy Body: (9, 2), (9, 1).\n\n*   **UP (6, 10):** Off board (y=10). FATAL.\n\n*   **DOWN (6, 8):**\n    *   On board: Yes.\n    *   Collision with body: No. (7, 8) is occupied, but (6, 8) is clear.\n    *   Apple at (6, 8)? No.\n    *   Status: SAFE.\n\n*   **LEFT (5, 9):**\n    *   On board: Yes.\n    *   Collision with body: No.\n    *   Apple at (5, 9)? No.\n    *   Status: SAFE.\n\n*   **RIGHT (7, 9):** Collision with my body (segment immediately behind head). FATAL.\n\nSafe Moves: DOWN (6, 8), LEFT (5, 9).\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves & Optimal Strategy**\n\nThe goal is to maximize apples while maintaining safety and mobility. I am currently parked in the top-left corner. The nearest apples are mostly clustered further down and to the left (e.g., (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6)) or further to the right/down (e.g., (9, 8), (9, 7), (8, 5)).\n\n*   **Option A: Move LEFT to (5, 9).**\n    *   No apple this turn.\n    *   This keeps me along the top wall.\n    *   Next possible moves: (4, 9) or (5, 8). (4, 9) is safe. This path extends along the wall and forces me to turn down soon anyway.\n\n*   **Option B: Move DOWN to (6, 8).**\n    *   No apple this turn.\n    *   This moves me inwards. (6, 7) has an apple. If I move to (6, 8), I can move to (6, 7) next turn and get an apple. This seems like a better targeting strategy.\n    *   If I move DOWN, my tail (7, 6) opens up, making (7, 7) a clear move space in the future.\n\n**Comparison:**\nMoving DOWN targets a specific apple (6, 7) that is only 1 block away next turn.\nMoving LEFT just extends along the wall, pushing me away from easy targets.\n\nLet's prioritize the immediate apple target at (6, 7).\n\n**4. Enemy Proximity/Danger Assessment**\n\nEnemy 0 ($E_H=(9, 3)$) is far away.\nPossible E0 moves:\n1. UP: (9, 4) (Safe, empty).\n2. DOWN: (9, 2) (Collision with body segment (9, 2), but (9, 2) is the tail, so if no apple eaten, the tail moves to (9, 2) and (9, 3) becomes the head. This is safe.)\n3. LEFT: (8, 3) (Safe, empty).\n4. RIGHT: (10, 3) (FATAL).\n\nIt is likely the enemy will continue moving UP or LEFT to target the apples in the center or the (9, 8)/(9, 7) cluster. There is no immediate collision risk for Snake 1 on the current turn.\n\n**5. Long-term Plan (Next 2-3 Turns)**\n\n1.  **T6: DOWN** to (6, 8). (Set up for apple)\n2.  **T7:** Move toward (6, 7) (Apple).\n3.  **T8:** Move toward the (4, X) and (3, X) apple clusters (e.g., (4, 7), (3, 4)).\n\nChoosing DOWN to (6, 8).\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note for next turn (Turn 7):**\nAfter moving DOWN to (6, 8), the most advantageous move is likely DOWN again to (6, 7) to secure the apple there. If I eat (6, 7), my body will extend safely into the middle of the board and I can then look to harvest the apples in columns 2, 3, and 4 (e.g., (4, 7), (4, 6), (3, 4)).\n\nDOWN",

Score +1.\n    *   This move was anticipated in the previous turn's rationale. It sets me up well for the center apples.\n\n*   **Option B: Move LEFT to (5, 8).**\n    *   No apple this turn.\n    *   Moves me closer to the dense apple clusters in columns 2, 3, 4. This is a good general direction but foregoes an immediate guaranteed apple.\n\n**Decision:** Prioritize the immediate apple capture at (6, 7).\n\n**4. Enemy Proximity/Danger Assessment**\n\nEnemy 0 is at $E_H=(9, 4)$. The enemy body is at (9, 3), (9, 2).\nPossible E0 moves:\n1. UP (9, 5): Safe. Good for targeting (9, 7), (9, 8).\n2. DOWN (9, 3): Safe movement (tail moves).\n3. LEFT (8, 4): Safe. Good for targeting center apples.\n4. RIGHT (10, 4): FATAL (wall).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 7), the enemy is still far away and poses no immediate threat. The enemy will likely continue moving UP or LEFT to harvest apples at (9, 7), (9, 8) or (8, 5) / (7, 5).\n\nThe move DOWN to (6, 7) is safe and optimal.\n\n**5. Long-term Plan (Next 2-3 Turns)**\n\n1.  **T7: DOWN** to (6, 7). (Eat apple, Length 8).\n2.  **T8:** From (6, 7), I should look to move LEFT to get into the central cluster of apples. (5, 7) is empty. (4, 7) has an apple.\n    *   **T8 Potential:** LEFT (5, 7). If I move LEFT, I can target (4, 7) next turn.\n    *   Alternatively, I could move DOWN to (6, 6) or (6, 5) and then sweep LEFT. (7, 5) and (8, 5) are apples.\n    *   The path LEFT to (4, 7) seems most promising for accessing the dense core (2, 7), (2, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7).\n3.  **T9 Potential:** LEFT (4, 7). (Eat apple).\n\nLet's target the (4, 7) apple after this turn.\n\n**Strategy Note for next turn (Turn 8):**\nAfter eating the apple at (6, 7), the snake needs to move into the central part of the board safely. Moves LEFT to (5, 7) or DOWN to (6, 6) are the primary safe options. I will prioritize moving LEFT towards the (4, 7) apple.\n\nDOWN",

Score: 7 apples.\n*Self-correction:* The last move was DOWN from (6, 8) to (6, 7). An apple was consumed at (6, 7). The body grew, meaning the old tail segment (8, 6) is now part of the body, and no segment was removed.\n\nEnemy Snake #0 Head $E_H=(9, 5)$, Body $E_B=[(9, 4), (9, 3)]$. Length 3. Score: 2 apples.\n*Self-correction:* The enemy snake moved from (9, 4) to (9, 5). It did not eat an apple (based on the provided body length and apple count). Its tail segment (9, 2) was removed.\n\nBoard size: 10x10 (0-9).\n\nApples remaining: $A = \\{(2, 6), (2, 7), (4, 3), (1, 2), (4, 7), (3, 3), (3, 4), (8, 5), (7, 5), (2, 1), (9, 8), (1, 1), (2, 8), (4, 6), (0, 4), (9, 0), (9, 7), (3, 0), (4, 4), (1, 0)\\}$. (Note: 6, 7 is gone).\n\n**2. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head 6, 7)**\n\n*   **Obstacles (Walls, My Body, Enemy Body/Head):**\n    *   My Body: $\\{(6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6)\\}$\n    *   Enemy Head: (9, 5).\n    *   Enemy Body: (9, 4), (9, 3).\n\n*   **UP (6, 8):** Collision with my body (segment immediately behind head). FATAL.\n\n*   **DOWN (6, 6):**\n    *   On board: Yes.\n    *   Collision with body: No.\n    *   Apple at (6, 6)? No.\n    *   Status: SAFE.\n\n*   **LEFT (5, 7):**\n    *   On board: Yes.\n    *   Collision with body: No.\n    *   Apple at (5, 7)? No.\n    *   Status: SAFE.\n\n*   **RIGHT (7, 7):**\n    *   On board: Yes.\n    *   Collision with body: No (7, 8 is part of the body, but 7, 7 is free).\n    *   Apple at (7, 7)? No.\n    *   Status: SAFE.\n\nSafe Moves: DOWN (6, 6), LEFT (5, 7), RIGHT (7, 7).\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves & Optimal Strategy**\n\nThe immediate goal is to reach the cluster of apples in the center-left (columns 2, 3, 4, Y=6, Y=7). The closest apple is (7, 5) or (8, 5) to the right, or (4, 7) to the left.\n\n*   **Option A: Move LEFT to (5, 7).**\n    *   This is the logical move to continue towards the dense apple area (4, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (4, 6).\n    *   If I move LEFT, I can target (4, 7) next turn. (4, 7) has an apple.\n\n*   **Option B: Move DOWN to (6, 6).**\n    *   This move takes me toward the lower center. Apples (7, 5), (8, 5) are 1 or 2 turns away, and access to (4, 6) is slightly delayed compared to Option A.\n\n*   **Option C: Move RIGHT to (7, 7).**\n    *   This leads towards (7, 5) and (8, 5) apples.\n    *   If I move (7, 7), I could go DOWN to (7, 6) or (7, 5) next. (7, 5) is an apple. This is attractive because it is an immediate apple target, similar to the left path.\n\n**4. Compare LEFT vs. RIGHT (Immediate Apple Targeting)**\n\n*   **LEFT (5, 7) -> (4, 7):** Two moves to eat apple (4, 7).\n*   **RIGHT (7, 7) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 5):** Two moves to eat apple (7, 5)\n*   **RIGHT (7, 7) -> (8, 7) -> (8, 6):** (8, 6) is my body. Bad path.\n*   **RIGHT (7, 7) -> (8, 7) -> (8, 5):** Three moves to eat apple (8, 5).\n\nWait, the Apple (7, 5) is only two moves away via RIGHT (7, 7) and then DOWN (7, 6). (7, 5) is a good target.\n\nLet's re-examine **LEFT (5, 7)**.\nFrom (5, 7), the move to (4, 7) is a guaranteed apple capture on turn 9. This is the fastest capture.\n\nLet's consider the enemy Snake #0 at $E_H=(9, 5)$.\nPossible E0 moves:\n1. UP (9, 6): Safe. Targeting (9, 7) or (9, 8).\n2. DOWN (9, 4): Safe (tail moves). Not very profitable.\n3. LEFT (8, 5): *Eats apple!* This is the most dangerous move for me, as it captures an apple I might want (8, 5) or (7, 5), and it brings the enemy closer to the center.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 7):\n*   I secure a path to (4, 7).\n*   I am safe from collision with E0, even if E0 moves LEFT to (8, 5) or UP to (9, 6).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 7):\n*   If E0 moves LEFT to (8, 5) and I move RIGHT to (7, 7), E0 is now at (8, 5). The next apple I target is (7, 5). This keeps the enemy relatively close, potentially blocking access to (7, 5) or setting up a dangerous encounter later.\n\nSince the goal is to consistently collect apples and maximize growth, the guaranteed closest apple is preferred, provided it doesn't lead to a dead end.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5, 7) sets up the capture of (4, 7) next turn. This is the most dense apple area for future collection. (2, 7), (2, 6), (4, 6), (2, 8).\n\nComparing speed:\nLEFT: (6, 7) -> (5, 7) [T8] -> (4, 7) [T9, EATS].\nRIGHT: (6, 7) -> (7, 7) [T8] -> (7, 6) [T9]. (7, 5) eaten on T10. (Slower)\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the superior move, as it leads to an apple capture one turn earlier and takes the snake into a more resource-rich sector.\n\n**5. Long-term Plan (Next 2-3 Turns)**\n\n1.  **T8: LEFT** to (5, 7).\n2.  **T9:** Move LEFT to (4, 7). (Eat apple, Length 9).\n3.  **T10:** From (4, 7), look for (4, 6) or (3, 4) or (2, 7). A common move would be DOWN to (4, 6) (apple) or LEFT to (3, 7) towards (3, 4) and (2, 7).\n\nLet's stick with LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

Note: The apple table confirms (4, 7) is no longer listed.\n\n**2. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 1 (Head 4, 7)**\n\n*   **Obstacles (Walls, My Body, Enemy Body/Head):**\n    *   My Body: $(5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (7, 9), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7)$\n    *   Enemy Head: $(9, 7)$ (Assuming enemy moved to capture (9, 7) this turn)\n    *   Enemy Body: $(9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4)$\n\n*   **UP (4, 8):** Safe. No collision. Apple (2, 8) is nearby, but (4, 8) is empty.\n*   **DOWN (4, 6):** **APPLE!** (4, 6) is an apple location. Safe.\n*   **LEFT (3, 7):** Safe. No collision. Moving closer to the dense left side.\n*   **RIGHT (5, 7):** Collision with my body (segment immediately behind head). FATAL.\n\nSafe Moves: UP (4, 8), DOWN (4, 6), LEFT (3, 7).\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves & Enemy Threat**\n\nA primary goal is to maintain momentum and capture nearby apples.\n\n*   **DOWN (4, 6):**\n    *   **Goal:** Immediate apple capture. +1 Apple.\n    *   **Safety:** Perfect. Moves into open space, away from the enemy. This is the highest priority move.\n\n*   **LEFT (3, 7):**\n    *   **Goal:** Move toward (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 4) cluster.\n    *   **Cost:** No immediate apple.\n\n*   **UP (4, 8):**\n    *   **Goal:** Move toward (2, 8).\n    *   **Cost:** No immediate apple. Seems slightly less advantageous than DOWN as the immediate cluster density is lower.\n\n*   **Enemy Threat Analysis:**\n    *   $H=(4, 7)$. $E_H$ is likely $(9, 7)$. The enemy is still very far, focused on the top-right corner, possibly aiming for (9, 8) next. There is no immediate collision risk.\n\n**4. Move Selection**\n\nThe move DOWN (4, 6) leads to an immediate apple capture and keeps the snake in a central position to address the surrounding apple clusters.\n\n**5. Long-term Plan (Next 2-3 Turns)**\n\n1.  **T10: DOWN** to (4, 6). (Eat apple, Length 10).\n2.  **T11:** From (4, 6), my body is [(5, 7), (6, 7), ...]. We will evaluate moves toward the cluster (3, 4), (3, 3), (4, 4), (4, 3).\n    *   LEFT (3, 6): Safe, moves towards (3, 4).\n    *   DOWN (4, 5): Safe, moves toward (4, 4).\n    *   Possibilities: LEFT (3, 6) or DOWN (4, 5). If we go DOWN, we can eat the apple at (4, 4) next.\n    *   Let's aim for the (4, 4) apple cluster. Strategy: Down to (4, 6), Down to (4, 5), Left/Down to (4, 4).\n3.  **T12:** If T11 was DOWN to (4, 5), then LEFT to (3, 5) or DOWN to (4, 4) (Apple). We will prioritize (4, 4).\n\nDOWN",

(4, 4) might be captured by the enemy if they were closer, but they are very far away.\n\n*   **RIGHT (5, 5):**\n    *   **Result:** Move towards the right cluster.\n    *   **Cons:** Least efficient move for the current target cluster.\n\n*   **Enemy Threat:** Snake 0 is at (9, 9).

(Note: (5, 5) is safe, (5, 4) is safe).\n\nSafe Moves: DOWN (4, 3), LEFT (3, 4), RIGHT (5, 4).\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves & Enemy Threat**\n\nWe have two moves leading to immediate apple capture. We must choose the path that maximizes future safety and apple access.\n\n*   **Option A: DOWN (4, 3)**\n    *   **Result:** Capture apple. Length 12.\n    *   **Follow up:** From (4, 3), the next closest apples are (3, 3) (LEFT), (3, 4) (UP, if not taken by enemy, but we chose not to take it now), (7, 2) (far right/down). (3, 3) is the best immediate target, moving LEFT. This path keeps us central and focused on the lower cluster.\n\n*   **Option B: LEFT (3, 4)**\n    *   **Result:** Capture apple. Length 12.\n    *   **Follow up:** From (3, 4), the next closest apples are (3, 3) (DOWN) and (4, 3) (RIGHT, if not taken by enemy, but we chose not to take it now). This path also targets the central cluster, prioritizing the vertical lines.\n\n*   **Option C: RIGHT (5, 4)**\n    *   **Result:** Move without eating.\n    *   **Cons:** Misses guaranteed apples. Avoid this move.\n\n**A vs B Tiebreaker:**\nBoth moves are excellent and lead to follow-up apples.\n\n*   If we go DOWN (4, 3), we are one step from (3, 3).\n*   If we go LEFT (3, 4), we are one step from (3, 3).\n\nThe board layout suggests a clockwise rotation clearing the fruit around (4, 4).\n1. (4, 4) [EAT: Done]\n2. (3, 4) or (4, 3) [EAT]\n3. (3, 3) [EAT]\n\nIf we choose LEFT (3, 4):\nT13: LEFT to (3, 4) [EAT]\nT14: DOWN to (3, 3) [EAT]\nT15: RIGHT to (4, 3) [EAT, if still there] or continue LEFT/DOWN.\n\nIf we choose DOWN (4, 3):\nT13: DOWN to (4, 3) [EAT]\nT14: LEFT to (3, 3) [EAT]\nT15: UP to (3, 4) [EAT, if still there] or continue LEFT/DOWN.\n\nBoth strategies are equally good for clearing the immediate 3-apple cluster ((4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)).\n\nHowever, moving DOWN (4, 3) slightly aligns us better for the lower apples: (3, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0), etc., should we decide to clear the bottom row next. Moving LEFT (3, 4) keeps us slightly higher, closer to (0, 4) and (1, 6).\n\nSince the enemy is far away (8, 9), we don't need to prioritize blocking them.\n\nLet's maintain the downward momentum from the previous turn to focus on clearing the bottom half of the board before swinging back up.\n\n**4. Move Selection**\nI choose DOWN to (4, 3) to capture the apple and position for (3, 3) next turn.\n\n**5. Long-term Plan (Next 2-3 Turns)**\n\n1.  **T13: DOWN** to (4, 3).
