DOWN (9, 0): Moves me onto the (9, 0) apple, which is the closest and immediately beneficial.\n2. LEFT (8, 1): Moves me toward the (3, 3) and (4, 0) apples, but they are farther away.\n3. UP (9, 2): Moves me toward the (3, 3) apple, but it's farther away.\n\n**Best Option:**\n- DOWN (9, 0) is the most promising because:\n  - It moves me onto the (9, 0) apple, which is the closest and immediately beneficial.\n  - It keeps me away from the enemy snake and avoids potential head-on collisions.\n  - It maintains flexibility for future moves toward other apples.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:**\nFocus on the (9, 0) apple first as it is the closest. After that, reassess the board state and target the next closest apple while avoiding the enemy snake.
