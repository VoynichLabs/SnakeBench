Moving DOWN to (9,2) would leave me hugging the right wall with fewer escape routes.\n3. **Safety**: The enemy snake is far away at (2,3) with no immediate threat of head-on collision.

The only immediately safe directions are **UP** (8,4), **DOWN** (8,2) and **LEFT** (7,3); moving **RIGHT** would run into my own body at (9,3) and is illegal.  \n- The nearest apple is at (8,0) \u2013 only three cells straight down the same column. A Manhattan\u2011distance check shows all other apples are at least eight steps away.  \n- The enemy snake is far away (head at (1,3)) and shows no sign of moving toward my column this turn, so a head\u2011on collision is not a concern.\n\n**Choosing the best move**\n\n1. **Safety first** \u2013 The move must keep the snake alive. All three safe directions satisfy this.  \n2. **Path to food** \u2013 Using a simple BFS (breadth\u2011first search) on the grid \u2013 the same technique used in the Snake\u2011Game AI to find the shortest safe path to food \u2013 confirms that moving **DOWN** leads straight to (8,0) in three steps without encountering any obstacles.  \n   *Reference: [github.com](https://github.com/mazerissa/Snake-Game)*  \n3. **Keeping future options open** \u2013 The tail\u2011chasing principle described in the Snake\u2011Algorithms repo advises always keeping the tail in sight and avoiding moves that would block the head from eventually reaching the tail. Moving down along the same column keeps the tail (currently at (8,5)) on the same vertical line, preserving a clear escape route after the apple is eaten.  \n   *Reference: [github.com](https://github.com/JeremyHub/Snake-Algorithms)*  \n4. **Enemy awareness** \u2013 The Battlesnake rules CLI documentation reminds us that all snakes move simultaneously; since the opponent is far and likely moving upward toward its own apple at (1,4), a downward move does not create a head\u2011on collision risk.  \n   *Reference: [github.com](https://github.com/BattlesnakeOfficial/rules/tree/main/cli)*  \n\n**Plan for the next few turns**\n\n- **Turn\u202f12\u201114:** Continue moving **DOWN** each turn until reaching (8,0) and eating the apple there.  \n- After eating, the snake will have grown by one segment. I will then evaluate the new apple spawns and, using the same BFS approach, target the next nearest safe apple (most likely (1,0) or (1,4) depending on the updated board).  \n- Throughout, I will keep the tail reachable and avoid tight corridors that could trap the head.\n\n**Final move for this turn**\n\nDOWN",
