It poses no immediate collision threat.\n\n**Strategy for this turn:**\n- My only viable safe moves are UP to (3, 9) or RIGHT to (4, 8). \n- Moving **RIGHT** to (4, 8) keeps me more central relative to the board's width and aligns me better for a descent towards the apples located at (5, 4), (1, 3), and (3, 1). \n- Moving UP puts me against the wall with fewer immediate options to maneuver around my own segments.\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\nI will move RIGHT to (4, 8). From there, I plan to move around the right side of my own body (which currently occupies the y=7 and y=8 rows) to head downwards toward the cluster of apples in the lower half of the board. The nearest apple is (5, 4). I must be careful not to trap myself against the top or left walls as my body follows me.\n\nRIGHT",

Possible moves: (8, 2) - NO, (9, 3), (9, 1), (8, 2).\n- It is at the bottom right corner, far from my current position at (5, 6). No immediate collision threat.\n\n**3. Strategy and Move Selection:**\n- The apple at (5, 4) is only 2 units away vertically. **DOWN** is the most efficient path.\n- After collecting (5, 4), the next closest targets would be (3, 1) or (9, 4).\n- My body is currently concentrated in the top-middle/left area (Rows 7 and 8). Moving down into the open middle area of the board is a good positional move.\n- I have 4 apples; one more apple gets me further ahead of Snake #0 (who has 2).\n\n**Future Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (5, 5) and then DOWN again to (5, 4) to collect the apple. This will increase my length to 6. From (5, 4), I will likely target (3, 1) or (1, 3) unless the enemy moves aggressively toward the right-side apples.\n\nDOWN",

It is very far from my current position at (1, 3), so there is no immediate threat of collision.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    *   **DOWN** is the best move. It positions me to collect the apple at (3, 1) in three turns (Move sequence: DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT or similar). The apple at (2, 5) is also reachable, but going for (3, 1) keeps me in a more open area of the board for now.\n\n**Future Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (1, 2). Then continue moving toward the apple at (3, 1) by moving DOWN again to (1, 1) and then RIGHT.

Its likely path is to move towards (6, 3) or circle back down. It is far away and not a threat this turn.\n\n4.  **Strategic Choices:**\n    *   **Option 1: DOWN to (3, 0).** This positions me perfectly to grab the apple at (2, 0) on the next turn. \n    *   **Option 2: RIGHT to (4, 1).** Moves toward (6, 3) or (8, 0).\n    *   **Option 3: UP to (3, 2).** This moves me towards (6, 3) and (2, 5). However, my body currently occupies (3, 3) and (4, 3), meaning moving UP puts me into a tighter space between my own body segments.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Moving DOWN to (3, 0) is the most efficient path. It puts me one step away from the apple at (2, 0). After grabbing (2, 0), I can head right along the bottom row (y=0) to pick up the apple at (8, 0), while my tail clears out of the (3, 3) area.\n\n**Future Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (3, 0), then LEFT to (2, 0) to collect the apple. After that, head RIGHT across the bottom toward (8, 0) while keeping an eye on the apple at (6, 3). Avoiding the self-trap in the (1, 3) to (4, 3) region is a priority.\n\nDOWN",

Next turn, I will likely go UP to (0, 0) or (1, 1) depending on body clearance, with the goal of circling around the left side of my current body mass to reach apples in the center or right.\n\nLEFT",

The cell (1, 2) is currently occupied by the tail of the snake (last segment). However, in Snake games, the tail moves forward as the head moves unless an apple is eaten. Since I did not eat an apple last turn, (1, 1) will move to (2, 1), and (1, 2) (the current tail) will disappear. However, moving into a space currently occupied by a tail can be risky if the logic allows for collisions before the tail vacates. More importantly, (1, 2) is surrounded by my own body at (1, 1) and (0, 2). Moving RIGHT now would put me in a very cramped position.\n\n3.  **Strategy:**\n    *   Continuing **UP** along the x=0 axis is the safest and most efficient way to clear my own body segments. \n    *   As I move UP to (0, 3), (0, 4), etc., my tail segments [(3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1)] will move out of the way, eventually opening up the right side of the board.\n    *   The nearest high-probability apples are (3, 4) and (2, 5).

Once the body segments at x=1 and x=2 have moved, I will turn RIGHT to intercept the apples at (3, 4) and (2, 5). This keeps the snake along the edge while the \"tangle\" in the bottom left unravels itself.\n\nUP",

Now that my head is at y=4, moving right puts me 2 steps away from the apple at (3, 4) and 2 steps away from the apple at (2, 5). \n    *   By moving RIGHT, I start clearing the left wall, allowing my tail (which is moving from (3, 1) to (3, 0)) to follow through the \"U-turn\" I've formed.\n    *   Snake 0 is far away at (9, 5), so there is no immediate threat of head-on collision.\n\n4.  **Long-term Plan:**\n    Move RIGHT to (1, 4).

If Snake 0 moves LEFT twice, it would reach (4, 2) next turn while I am at (3, 2). There is no immediate head-on collision risk at (3, 2) this turn.\n    *   **Snake 0's Moves:** Snake 0 is likely targeting the apple at (5, 2). If it moves LEFT to (5, 2) this turn, it eats that apple.\n    *   **Future Pathing:** After taking (3, 2), I will need to be careful of Snake 0's head. However, taking the apple at (3, 2) is the most efficient move to increase my lead and grow. The board space to my right is opening up as Snake 0's tail moves, but its head is currently a threat in the middle-right area.\n\n4.  **Long-term Plan:**\n    Move DOWN to (3, 2) to collect the apple. This will increase my length and score. Following that, I will evaluate if the apple at (5, 2) is still available or if I should navigate toward the apple at (0, 5) or (8, 0). I must remain cautious of Snake 0, which is currently operating in the same horizontal corridor.\n\nDOWN",

It puts space between me and Snake #0's head. It also positions me to potentially contest the apples at (2, 3) or (7, 5).\n    *   **DOWN (4, 1):** High risk of head-on collision. Snake #0's most natural path to move away from me or seek lower-board space is towards (4, 1).\n    *   **Snake #0's Position:** Snake #0 is currently in a slightly cramped position near the bottom right. Their head is at (5, 1). They must move. UP (5, 2) is their own body. RIGHT (6, 1) is open. DOWN (5, 0) is open. LEFT (4, 1) is open but risky for them as well.\n\n4.  **Long-term Plan:**\n    Move UP to (4, 3). From there, I can pivot LEFT to take the apple at (2, 3) or move towards the upper middle board. This keeps me away from the wall and Snake #0 while maintaining my lead.\n\nUP",

Moves into open space toward the apple at (7, 5).\n    *   **DOWN (5, 3):** **SAFE**. Moves into open space toward the apple at (7, 2).\n    *   **LEFT (4, 4):** **DEATH** (Backwards into neck).\n    *   **RIGHT (6, 4):** **SAFE**. This is a solid move toward the center-right area. However, note that Snake #0's body is at (6, 3) and (6, 2).\n\n3.  **Strategy and Risk Assessment:**\n    *   **Snake #0** is at (7, 0) and will almost certainly move RIGHT to (8, 0) to eat that apple.\n    *   My body is currently coiled in the (0-4, 2-5) area, creating some pathing restrictions.\n    *   The apple at (7, 2) is being defended somewhat by Snake #0's body (a vertical wall at x=5 and x=6).\n    *   The apple at (7, 5) is very accessible.\n    *   If I move **UP** to (5, 5), I am well-positioned to sweep across the top for (7, 5). \n    *   If I move **RIGHT** to (6, 4), I am one step closer to the apples but closer to the opponent's body segments.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    Move **UP** to (5, 5). This keeps me above the main body mass of Snake #0 and gives me a clear path to (7, 5) while keeping the option to drop down for (7, 2) later. It also avoids any potential congestion at (6, 4) if Snake #0's tail segments were to somehow interfere or if Snake #0 moves unexpectedly.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove toward (7, 5) to increase the lead. Watch Snake #0 as they collect (8, 0); they will likely then turn upward toward (7, 2). I want to secure (7, 5) first, then potentially (7, 2) or look for a way to loop back toward the apples on the left as my tail clears those areas.\n\nUP",

However, this moves toward Snake #0's body and doesn't get me an apple immediately.\n    *   **LEFT (5, 5):** **DEATH** (Backwards into neck).\n\n3.  **Strategy and Risk Assessment:**\n    *   The apple at **(7, 5)** is only 1 step away (RIGHT). Collecting it increases my score to 14.\n    *   Snake #0 is at (8, 1). If I move to (7, 5), I will be at (7, 5) while Snake #0 could move to (8, 2), (9, 1), (7, 1), or (8, 0).

It's a guaranteed apple and a safe move.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter eating the apple at (7, 5), the next closest apples are (7, 2) and (4, 8). I must watch Snake #0's movement; since they are at (8, 1), they will likely contest (7, 2). If they move toward (7, 2), I will pivot UP toward (4, 8) to maintain space and avoid a potential head-on collision or being cut off. My tail will vacate (0, 4) soon, eventually freeing up the left side.\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #0 will likely take (7, 2) and remain in the bottom section.

Body: [(7, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3)]. (Enemy just ate the apple at (7, 2)).\n    *   **Apples:** (0, 5), (2, 3), (4, 8), (2, 8), (5, 9).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (7, 6)):**\n    *   **UP (7, 7):** **SAFE**. Moves toward higher value density of apples (4, 8), (2, 8), (5, 9).\n    *   **DOWN (7, 5):** **DEATH** (Backwards into neck).\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 6):** **SAFE**. Moves toward the edge, away from obstacles.\n    *   **LEFT (6, 6):** **SAFE**. Moves toward the center.\n\n3.  **Strategy and Risk Assessment:**\n    *   **Proximity to Enemy:** Snake 0 is at (7, 2), which is quite far (4 units below). I am safely positioned in the upper half of the board.\n    *   **Apple Targets:** The cluster at (4, 8), (2, 8), and (5, 9) is the most efficient target.\n    *   **Pathing:** Moving UP to (7, 7) allows for a flexible approach to (4, 8) or (5, 9).\n    *   **Obstacles:** My tail is currently bunched up on the left side (columns 1-5, rows 2-5). Moving UP and then LEFT across the top (row 7 or 8) bypasses this mess entirely.\n\n4.  **Decision:** Move **UP** to (7, 7). This keeps the most options open for reaching the top-row apples while maintaining maximum distance from both the enemy and my own body.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will proceed to (7, 8) then turn LEFT to collect (4, 8) and (2, 8). If the enemy moves towards (5, 9), I will evaluate whether to contest it or pivot. My goal is to stay in the upper board area until my tail clears out of the middle-left.\n\nUP",

Once (2, 8) is secured, look to grab (5, 9) or pivot down toward (0, 5) depending on how Snake 0 maneuvers. Avoid getting caught between the top wall and your own body segments at (7, 8).\n\nLEFT",

Leads toward (5, 9) but puts me against the top wall.\n    *   **DOWN (4, 7):** **SAFE**. This area is empty.\n    *   **LEFT (3, 8):** **SAFE**. This is the direct path toward the apple at (2, 8).\n    *   **RIGHT (5, 8):** **DEATH** (Backwards into neck).\n\n3.  **Strategy and Assessment:**\n    *   There is an immediate apple at (2, 8) and another at (5, 9).\n    *   Snake #0 is currently at (8, 6) moving upward toward the right-hand corner. It is not an immediate threat to the head, but it is occupying space near the center-right.\n    *   Moving **LEFT** to (3, 8) is the most efficient path to the apple at (2, 8). It keeps my head in open space and maintains momentum away from my own coiled body segments.\n    *   If I go UP to (4, 9), I'm hugging the wall and will eventually have to navigate around (5, 9) while my body at (5, 8) and (6, 8) blocks my path back down.\n    *   Space Check: My current tail is at (3, 4). As I move toward (2, 8), the tail will move forward, eventually opening up the (3, 2)-(3, 4) area.\n\n4.  **Decision:** Move **LEFT** to (3, 8). This targets the apple at (2, 8). After that, I can decide whether to loop up for (5, 9) or head down for (0, 5) or (2, 3).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nGrab the apple at (2, 8). After (2, 8), the plan is to assess the safety of (0, 5) versus (5, 9). Avoiding the cluster of segments at (7, 8)-(7, 5) is important to ensure I don't trap myself against the right wall or top-right corner.\n\nLEFT",

While not immediately fatal, it reduces my maneuvering space.\n    *   The enemy (Snake 0) just ate the apple at (5, 9) and is now at (5, 9). They are likely heading left or down, but they are far away from my current position.\n\n4.  **Long-term Plan:**\n    *   Continue moving **DOWN** the 0-column to collect the apple at (0, 5).\n    *   After (0, 5), I will aim for (0, 1) or cut right towards (3, 5) and (2, 3) depending on how the tail clears and where Snake 0 moves.\n    *   I currently have a 4-apple lead and plenty of open space in the bottom-left quadrant.\n\nDOWN",

Body: [(0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 4)].\n    *   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (3, 9). Body: [(4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2)].\n    *   **Apples:** (0, 5), (2, 3), (6, 3), (3, 5), (0, 1).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Moves for Snake 1 (Head at (0, 6)):**\n    *   **UP (0, 7):** **DEATH** (Hits own body).\n    *   **LEFT:** **DEATH** (Off board).\n    *   **RIGHT (1, 6):** **SAFE**. Leads into open space.\n    *   **DOWN (0, 5):** **SAFE**. This move collects the apple at (0, 5).\n\n3.  **Strategy Assessment:**\n    *   **Move DOWN (0, 5):** This is the logical choice. It consumes the apple at (0, 5), increasing the score to 18. This keeps me on the edge of the board and closes in on the next apple at (0, 1).\n    *   **Enemy Observation:** Snake 0 is at (3, 9). Their only safe moves are LEFT (2, 9) (DEATH - hits your body) or DOWN (3, 8) (DEATH - hits your body). Snake 0 is currently trapped by your body at (2, 9) and (3, 8). Unless they can move into a space your tail just vacated, they are in a very tight spot. Actually, checking the coordinates: (2, 9) and (3, 8) are currently occupied by Snake 1's body. \n    *   Snake 0's possible moves from (3, 9):\n        *   (2, 9): Occupied by Snake 1.\n        *   (4, 9): Occupied by Snake 0's own body (backwards).\n        *   (3, 8): Occupied by Snake 1.\n        *   (3, 10): Off board.\n    *   Snake 0 is guaranteed to die this turn as all adjacent cells are occupied by bodies or are off-board.\n\n4.  **Long-term Plan:**\n    *   Collect the apple at (0, 5).\n    *   Since the opponent is about to die, the game will likely end this turn or the next.\n\nDOWN",
