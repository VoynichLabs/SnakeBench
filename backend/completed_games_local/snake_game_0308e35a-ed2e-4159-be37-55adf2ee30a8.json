Coordinates are 0-9.\n\nMy current position (Head): (5, 6).\n\nAvailable moves:\n1. UP: (5, 7)\n2. DOWN: (5, 5)\n3. LEFT: (4, 6)\n4. RIGHT: (6, 6)\n\nCheck for immediate death conditions:\n1. Off the board: All four moves (5, 7), (5, 5), (4, 6), (6, 6) are within the 10x10 bounds. Safe.\n2. Into own body: I have no body segments, so this is safe, including moving backwards (which is irrelevant here).\n3. Into opponent's head or body: Opponent head is at (9, 2), body is none. None of my adjacent cells collide with the opponent.\n\nAll four moves are safe initially (barring simultaneous head collision). Since the opponent is far away (at (9, 2)), a head-on collision is impossible this turn.\n\nNow, evaluate moves based on apple proximity and future options.\n\nApples are at: (5, 1), (7, 3), (8, 6), (6, 8), (6, 5), (3, 4), (4, 9), (0, 3), (9, 8), (7, 5), (7, 0), (2, 3), (6, 9), (0, 4), (8, 5), (5, 8), (3, 0), (5, 2), (3, 7), (7, 8).\n\nDistances to nearest apples (Manhattan distance):\nMy position: (5, 6)\n\n1. (5, 8) (2 steps, UP): Straight UP 2 steps.\n2. (6, 5) (2 steps, RIGHT, DOWN): 1 step right, 1 step down.\n3. (3, 7) (3 steps, LEFT, UP)\n4. (7, 5) (3 steps, RIGHT, DOWN)\n5. (8, 6) (3 steps, RIGHT)\n\nEvaluating choices:\n\n1. UP to (5, 7): Moves towards (5, 8) (apple). Good.\n2. DOWN to (5, 5): Moves towards (6, 5) and (7, 5). Good.\n3. LEFT to (4, 6): Moves towards (3, 7). Fair.\n4. RIGHT to (6, 6): Moves towards (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 6). Good.\n\nLet's look at the density of apples nearby.\n\n(5, 6)\nIf I move UP to (5, 7), I point towards (5, 8).\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 5), I point towards (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5).\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 6), I point towards (6, 5), (8, 6), (7, 8), (6, 8).\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 6), I point towards (3, 7), (3, 4).\n\nThe immediate apple is at (6, 5) (2 steps) or (5, 8) (2 steps).\n\nMoving UP to (5, 7) keeps me centrally located and moves directly towards (5, 8) and (6, 8). It also gives good access to the top row (4, 9), (6, 9).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 6) gives access to (6, 5), (8, 6), and a dense group of apples to the East (7, 5), (8, 5).\n\nSince I am at (5, 6), moving UP or RIGHT seems equally attractive based on proximity to the nearest apples (2 steps away in both general directions).\n\nLet's analyze the grouping.\nNorth/East region: (5, 8), (6, 8), (4, 9), (6, 9), (9, 8), (7, 8). This area is quite dense.\nSouth/East region: (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (7, 3), (8, 6). Also dense.\n\nIf I go UP: (5, 7). Next turn I can hit (5, 8) (apple) by going UP again, provided it is not taken.\nIf I go RIGHT: (6, 6). Next turn I can hit (6, 5) (apple) by going DOWN, or (8, 6) by going RIGHT (2 steps total for 8, 6).\n\nIf I move UP to (5, 7):\nNext moves target: (5, 8) [A], (6, 7), (4, 7).\n(5, 8) is reachable in 1 more step UP.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 6):\nNext moves target: (6, 5) [A], (7, 6), (5, 6).\n(6, 5) is reachable in 1 more step DOWN.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT lead quickly to an apple in 2 turns total (1 move this turn + 1 move next turn, assuming the apple isn't moved upon this turn).\n\nI prefer moving UP because it puts me in a good position to exploit the central northern region of apples, especially (5, 8), (6, 8), and offers routes toward the corner (4, 9), (6, 9).\n\n(5, 7) is a safe, forward-looking move towards a nearby apple (5, 8).\n\nLong-term plan: Head North to collect (5, 8) and then decide whether to sweep East or West across the top region.\n\nUP",

EATING!\n\nI have two moves that immediately result in apple consumption: UP and RIGHT.\n\n**4. Compare UP vs RIGHT:**\n\n*   **Move UP to (5, 9):**\n    *   Eats an apple.\n    *   Puts me on the top edge of the board.\n    *   Potential follow-up moves: LEFT (4, 9 - Apple!), RIGHT (6, 9 - Apple!), DOWN (5, 8 - my future body). This gives access to 4 apples nearby: (4, 9), (6, 9), (9, 8).\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (6, 8):**\n    *   Eats an apple.\n    *   Puts me in a central location for the cluster of apples: (7, 8), (8, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (8, 5), (9, 8).\n    *   Potential follow-up moves: UP (6, 9 - Apple!), DOWN (6, 7), LEFT (5, 8 - my future body), RIGHT (7, 8 - Apple!). This gives immediate access to follow-up apples (6, 9) and (7, 8).\n\nBoth moves are equally good in terms of immediate reward (1 apple). I need to select the one that optimizes future movement and limits exposure.\n\nScenario A: Move UP to (5, 9).\nNext turn (Turn 3), from (5, 9):\n1. LEFT to (4, 9) (Apple)\n2. RIGHT to (6, 9) (Apple)\n3. DOWN to (5, 8) (Future body - deadly if I turn back)\nThis path secures two more apples in T+1, leading to length 4 quickly.\n\nScenario B: Move RIGHT to (6, 8).\nNext turn (Turn 3), from (6, 8):\n1. UP to (6, 9) (Apple)\n2. RIGHT to (7, 8) (Apple)\n3. DOWN to (6, 7)\n4. LEFT to (5, 8) (Future body - deadly if I turn back)\nThis path also secures two more apples in T+1, leading to length 4 quickly.\n\nBoth paths offer significant short-term gain. Let's look at the remaining board density near the edges.\n\nIf I take UP (5, 9), I am on the top boundary. If I want to access (9, 8), I would go (6, 9) -> (7, 9) -> ... or (6, 9) -> (7, 8) -> ...\nIf I take RIGHT (6, 8), I am already further right, in a more central access point to the eastern apples (7, 8), (9, 8).\n\nThe (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9) line offers three apples right next to each other, plus (6, 8) which I could take now, and (7, 8).\n\nIf I choose RIGHT to (6, 8), I am set up to follow the upper-right corner effectively.\nT2: (5, 8) -> (6, 8) [Eat A]\nT3 options: (6, 9) [Eat A] or (7, 8) [Eat A]. (6, 9) is on the boundary, (7, 8) is slightly more inward but also near boundary.\n\nIf I choose UP to (5, 9), I am also set up for the same cluster.\nT2: (5, 8) -> (5, 9) [Eat A]\nT3 options: (4, 9) [Eat A] or (6, 9) [Eat A].\n\nBoth are highly viable. Choosing RIGHT (6, 8) seems slightly better as it positions me slightly more centrally towards a slightly larger cluster of apples like (7, 8), (8, 6), (9, 8), and (7, 5).\n\nLet's commit to RIGHT.\n\nLong-term plan (T3 onwards): Move to (6, 8) which eats an apple. From (6, 8), I will assess moving to (7, 8) or (6, 9), both of which contain apples, prioritizing the one that keeps movement options open, likely following the Eastern boundary cluster downwards.\n\nRIGHT",

(Total 20 apples).\nNote: (7, 8) and (6, 9) were potential apples last turn. Game state shows (6, 9) is still an apple, and (7, 8) is occupied by my head '0'.\n\nThe board configuration reflecting Turn 4 state:\n 9 . . . . A . A . . .\n 8 . . . . A T T 0 . A\n 7 . . . A .

UP: (7, 9) [Empty]\n2. DOWN: (7, 7) [Empty]\n3. LEFT: (6, 8) [My body!]\n4. RIGHT: (8, 8) [Empty]\n\n**2. Check for immediate death conditions:**\n\nA. Off the board: All coordinates are within [0, 9] x [0, 9]. Safe.\n\nB. Into own body:\nLEFT to (6, 8) is my body segment. This is illegal. DEATHTRAP.\nEliminate LEFT.\n\nC. Into opponent's collision zone or body:\nEnemy Head is at (7, 4). Enemy Body is at (7, 3). They are far away from (7, 8). No head-on collision risk on the chosen squares.\n\n**Remaining safe moves:** UP (7, 9), DOWN (7, 7), RIGHT (8, 8).\n\n**3. Evaluate safe moves for apples:**\n\n1. UP to (7, 9): Empty space.\n2. DOWN to (7, 7): Empty space.\n3. RIGHT to (8, 8): Empty space. (Note: (9, 8) is an Apple!)\n\nNone of the moves eat an apple immediately. I must choose the best path towards the nearby apples: (6, 9), (9, 8), (4, 8), (8, 6), (7, 5), (8, 5).\n\n**4. Evaluate safe moves for positioning:**\n\n*   **Move UP to (7, 9):**\n    *   Places me on the top edge. Good for access to (6, 9) [Apple] or (9, 8) [Apple].\n    *   From (7, 9), future moves: LEFT (6, 9) [Apple!], RIGHT (8, 9) [Empty], DOWN (7, 8) [Future Body].\n    *   This is an excellent setup for grabbing (6, 9) next turn. Snake 1 is nowhere near this area.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (7, 7):**\n    *   Leads me into the dense middle area. Good for accessing (7, 5) [Apple] or (8, 5) [Apple].\n    *   From (7, 7), future moves: UP (7, 8) [Future Body], DOWN (7, 6) [Empty], LEFT (6, 7) [Empty], RIGHT (8, 7) [Empty].\n    *   This is a less direct route to the next immediate apple, but keeps open access to the lower area cluster.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (8, 8):**\n    *   Places me closer to the right edge and (9, 8) [Apple].\n    *   From (8, 8), future moves: UP (8, 9) [Empty], DOWN (8, 7) [Empty], LEFT (7, 8) [Future Body], RIGHT (9, 8) [Apple!].\n    *   This is an excellent setup for grabbing (9, 8) next turn. It also opens up (8, 6) [Apple] and (8, 5) [Apple].\n\n**5. Choosing the best path:**\n\nBoth UP to (7, 9) and RIGHT to (8, 8) set me up for an apple feed on Turn 5.\n\n1.  **UP -> (7, 9). Next Turn: LEFT -> (6, 9) [Apple].**\n    *   This apple (6, 9) is on the top edge, slightly isolated from future moves unless I go for (5, 9) or along the top edge.\n\n2.  **RIGHT -> (8, 8). Next Turn: RIGHT -> (9, 8) [Apple].**\n    *   This apple (9, 8) is in the corner. From (9, 8), the only moves are DOWN (9, 7) and LEFT (8, 8 - Future Body, possible dead end later). If I go DOWN, I access (9, 4) or sweep towards (8, 6), (8, 5).\n\nComparing the two clusters:\nThe cluster starting with (9, 8) and continuing towards (8, 6), (8, 5), (7, 5) seems richer and more accessible than the cluster starting with (6, 9) and leading towards (4, 9).\n\n(7, 8) -> RIGHT -> (8, 8) is preferable as it secures the corner apple (9, 8) and keeps me aligned to sweep down the right side where many apples are located: (8, 6), (8, 5).\n\nThe enemy snake is unlikely to interfere with either choice, as it is far below.\n\nI will choose RIGHT to move closer to (9, 8).\n\n**Long-term plan (T5 onwards):** Move RIGHT to (8, 8). Next turn, move RIGHT to (9, 8) (Apple). Then look to sweep down the right side (9, 7), towards (9, 4) (Apple) and across the 8-column for (8, 6) and (8, 5).\n\nRIGHT",

Check for immediate death conditions (Self and Walls):**\n*   Wall collisions: RIGHT to (10, 8) is illegal.\n*   Own body collision: LEFT to (8, 8) is my body (the second segment). Illegal.\n\nSafe moves remaining: UP (9, 9), DOWN (9, 7).\n\n**3. Check for immediate death conditions (Enemy Snake 1):**\nEnemy Head is at (6, 5). My head is at (9, 8). We are far apart. No immediate head-on collision threat.\nPossible next positions for Snake 1 (Head (6, 5), Body (7, 5)):\n1. UP (6, 6)\n2. DOWN (6, 4) [Apple!]\n3. LEFT (5, 5)\n4. RIGHT (7, 5) [Body!] -> Illegal.\n\nWherever Snake 1 moves, it does not currently constrain (9, 9) or (9, 7).\n\n**4. Evaluate safe moves for apples and future space:**\n\n*   **UP to (9, 9):** Moves into a corner. Safe, but restricts future options significantly, only LEFT or DOWN from (9, 9) next turn. Does not target any apple.\n*   **DOWN to (9, 7):** Moves along the edge, opens up the board downwards. Targets apples (9, 4) eventually. (8, 7) is also nearby. This seems like a much better move for future movement.\n\nApples near me: (8, 6), (8, 5), (9, 4), (8, 7).\nIf I move DOWN to (9, 7):\n*   Next turn, I can move LEFT to (8, 7) (Apple!), or continue DOWN to (9, 6).\nIf I move UP to (9, 9):\n*   Next turn, I must move LEFT to (8, 9) (Empty) or DOWN to (9, 8) (Future Body/Tail). This is dangerous as it locks me into a narrow path immediately after eating an apple and growing.\n\nMoving DOWN to (9, 7) aims to escape the immediate corner trap and move towards the cluster of apples further down the right side (9, 4) and into the center (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5).\n\n**5. Selecting the move:**\nDOWN to (9, 7) is the safest and most strategic move to continue pursuing apples and maintaining open space.\n\n**6. Future Plan consideration:**\nT6: Move DOWN to (9, 7).\nT7: From (9, 7), I will likely move LEFT to (8, 7) (Apple!) to access the row 8 apples, or DOWN further towards (9, 4) (Apple!). Since (8, 7) is an apple and keeps the body along the side, that looks optimal for T7.\n\nDOWN",

Selecting the move (Maximize apples):**\n\nMove DOWN to (8, 5).\n\n**6. Future Plan:**\nT9: DOWN to (8, 5) (Eat apple).\nT10: From (8, 5), S1 is still far. My body now occupies (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8). The tail (6, 8) might drop if I don't eat an apple. If I eat, length 8.\nIf I eat the apple at (8, 5), I will be looking for apples around me: (9, 4) is relatively close. (4, 4), (4, 3) are further away.\nPriority moves from (8, 5) next turn: LEFT (7, 5) (if S1's tail drops) or DOWN (8, 4). Since (7, 5) is currently S1's body and S1 is far away, assuming S1 continues its movement pattern (likely eating at (5, 2) or (4, 3)), (7, 5) might become available if S1's tail moves from (7, 4). But S1's body is [(6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4)]. The current tail (7, 4) will move to (x, y) if S1 eats, otherwise it drops. S1's head is at (5, 3). If S1 moves to (5, 2), the tail stays at (7, 4). If S1 moves to (4, 3), the tail stays at (7, 4). The current segment at (7, 5) remains occupied.\nTherefore, from (8, 5), I should prioritize moving DOWN to (8, 4) to maintain distance from my segmented body on the right edge, or attempt to move LEFT towards (7, 5) if it opens up, or RIGHT to (9, 5) to go for the apple at (9, 4). Moving DOWN to (8, 4) seems safe and gives maximum options.\n\nDOWN",

Let's verify the body representation based on the board (T for my tail/body, 1 for enemy head, A for apple):\n\nMy body (T): (8, 6), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8). (This is correct based on the board state T's near 0).\nEnemy body (implicit, since the board only shows 1's head): Assuming S1 moved to (5, 2), its body is at [(5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4)].\n\n**1. Determine potential moves from (8, 5) (My Head):**\n1. UP: (8, 6) [My body segment 1!]\n2. DOWN: (8, 4) [Empty]\n3. LEFT: (7, 5) [Enemy body segment 5 (S1 Body: (7, 5))]\n4. RIGHT: (9, 5) [Empty]\n\n**2. Check for immediate death conditions (Self and Walls):**\n*   Wall collisions: None.\n*   Own body collision: UP to (8, 6) is my immediate body segment. Illegal.\n*   Enemy body collision: LEFT to (7, 5) is Enemy Body segment 5. Illegal.\n\nSafe moves remaining: DOWN (8, 4) (Empty), RIGHT (9, 5) (Empty).\n\n**3. Check for immediate collision threats (Enemy Snake 1):**\nEnemy Head is at (5, 2). My head is at (8, 5). They are distant (3 in X, 3 in Y). No immediate head-on collision or T-boning threat.\nS1 safe moves from (5, 2):\n1. UP: (5, 3) [Body!] -> Illegal.\n2. DOWN: (5, 1) [Apple!] -> Very likely S1 will take this.\n3. LEFT: (4, 2) [Empty]\n4. RIGHT: (6, 2) [Empty]\n\nS1 is highly likely to move DOWN to (5, 1) to eat the next apple.\n\n**4. Evaluate safe moves for apples and future space:**\n\nA. **DOWN to (8, 4):**\n*   Safe, empty move.\n*   Next turn from (8, 4), I can reach (9, 4) (Apple) via RIGHT. Or (7, 4) [Enemy body (7, 4) is the current tail. If S1 moves to (5, 1) and eats, the tail stays, so (7, 4) is occupied. If S1 moves without eating, (7, 4) drops]. Since S1 is eating, (7, 4) remains occupied by the tail, so LEFT (7, 4) is still dangerous/illegal.\n*   DOWN (8, 3) is also empty.\n*   This path moves me away from my lengthy body cluttering the top right corner.\n\nB. **RIGHT to (9, 5):**\n*   Safe, empty move.\n*   Sets up for (9, 4) (Apple!) next turn. This is an immediate target.\n*   Moving toward the edge, which can be risky, but (9, 4) is an apple worth taking.\n\n**Comparison and Decision:**\n\nMove A (DOWN to (8, 4)) provides spatial flexibility.\nMove B (RIGHT to (9, 5)) sets up for an apple capture at (9, 4) next turn.\n\nSince (9, 4) is an immediate apple target, and moving RIGHT to (9, 5) makes (9, 4) available on T11, this seems like the stronger choice. The main risk is being trapped against the wall, but since I am long (length 8), using the edge to secure apples is sometimes necessary.\n\nRelying on the wall for two steps (8, 5) -> (9, 5) -> (9, 4) (Apple) seems solid. Once at (9, 4), the subsequent move options are:\n*   UP: (9, 5) [My body segment 1] -> Illegal. (Wait, if I move to (9, 5), my body is (8, 5). If I move to (9, 4), my body is (9, 5). UP to (9, 5) is hitting myself.)\n    *   T10: (8, 5) -> (9, 5). Body: (8, 5), (8, 6)...\n    *   T11: From (9, 5), UP to (9, 6) [Empty], DOWN to (9, 4) [Apple], LEFT to (8, 5) [Body].\n*   If move is RIGHT to (9, 5):\n    *   T11 options from (9, 5): UP (9, 6), DOWN (9, 4) [APPLE], LEFT (8, 5) [Body!].\n    *   I should go DOWN to (9, 4) to eat the apple.\n\nThis sequence guarantees an apple quickly and keeps my lead.\n\nLet's quickly re-evaluate DOWN to (8, 4).\n*   T10: (8, 5) -> (8, 4). Body: (8, 5), (8, 6)...\n*   T11 options from (8, 4): UP (8, 5) [Body!], DOWN (8, 3), LEFT (7, 4) [Enemy Tail/Body - dangerous], RIGHT (9, 4) [APPLE].\n*   If I go RIGHT to (9, 4), I eat an apple, same result as the other path, just one turn delayed for the path to the apple.\n\nSince both paths lead to the apple at (9, 4) on Turn 11, let's look at the interim moves:\nPath 1: (8, 5) -> RIGHT (9, 5) -> DOWN (9, 4) [EAT]\nPath 2: (8, 5) -> DOWN (8, 4) -> RIGHT (9, 4) [EAT]\n\nPath 1 requires moving along the edge (9, 5) position. Path 2 moves internal (8, 4) position. Both are safe.\n(8, 4) gives access to (8, 3) (further from obstacles).\n(9, 5) gives access to (9, 6) (closer to edge and my body components (9, 7)).\n\nSince the area around (8, 4) seems slightly more open and easier to maneuver out of after eating (9, 4) (as I'd be at (9, 4) with my body leading back to (8, 4)), compared to being at (9, 4) with my body leading back to (9, 5) and then (8, 5), I slightly prefer DOWN to (8, 4). This move keeps me less confined by the walls and my large snake body occupying (9, 5) and above.\n\nMoreover, if I move RIGHT to (9, 5), I isolate myself from the center of the board, making it longer to reach the other apple clusters. Moving DOWN to (8, 4) is a more central path while still targeting (9, 4).\n\nI choose DOWN.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nT10: DOWN to (8, 4) (Safe positioning).\nT11: RIGHT to (9, 4) (Eat apple).\nT12: From (9, 4), look for apples further down the right edge (none immediately close on the edge) or move LEFT to (8, 4) (my T11 body position) or DOWN (9, 3). If (7, 4) opens up (S1 tail drops), moving towards the center to targets like (4, 5) or (4, 4) is desirable.\n\nDOWN",

No collision threat to (8, 4) or its neighbors.\n\n**4. Evaluate safe moves for apples and future space:**\n\nA. **RIGHT to (9, 4):**\n*   *Eats an apple.* This is the primary objective based on proximity and safety.\n*   New head at (9, 4), length increases to 9.

Does not eat immediately.\n*   New head at (8, 3).\n*   Allows the apple at (9, 4) to remain available for T12 (via RIGHT).\n*   If I move DOWN, S1 might try to get (9, 4) on subsequent turns if it moves aggressively upwards, but S1 is currently far away (5, 1).\n*   Future options from (8, 3):\n    *   UP: (8, 4) [Body segment 1! *Deadly*]\n    *   DOWN: (8, 2) [Empty]\n    *   LEFT: (7, 3) [Empty]\n    *   RIGHT: (9, 3) [Empty]\n*   This keeps my options open but delays the apple capture. Given the high apple count competition (7 vs 7), immediate apple capture is strongly preferred.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nMoving RIGHT to (9, 4) is the only move that secures an apple this turn and is safe. It executes the immediate goal of the long-term plan swiftly.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will be at (9, 4) with a body segment at (8, 4). The area around me is tight due to the wall and my existing body mass in the 8/9 column above.\nT12: From (9, 4), I need to choose between (9, 5) (UP) and (9, 3) (DOWN). Down to (9, 3) seems preferable to move away from my thick body in the wall corner.

I should try to move away from the dense body mass in the upper right corner (around (8, 4) to (9, 8)) and potentially look towards the central apples or travel down the right side.\n\n**1. Determine potential moves from (9, 4) (My Head):**\n\n1. UP: (9, 5) [Empty]\n2. DOWN: (9, 3) [Empty]\n3. LEFT: (8, 4) [My Body segment 1! *Deadly*]\n4. RIGHT: (10, 4) [Into the Wall! *Deadly*]\n\n**2. Check for immediate death conditions (Self and Walls):**\n*   Wall collisions: RIGHT to (10, 4) is illegal.\n*   Own body collision: LEFT to (8, 4) is illegal.\n\nSafe moves remaining: UP (9, 5), DOWN (9, 3).\n\n**3. Check for immediate collision threats (Enemy Snake 1):**\nS1 Head is at (4, 1). We are distant. No immediate head-on threat.\n\nS1 likely moves from (4, 1):\n1. UP: (4, 2) [Apple!]\n2. DOWN: (4, 0) [Empty]\n3. LEFT: (3, 1) [Empty]\n4. RIGHT: (5, 1) [Body!] -> Illegal.\n\nS1 is very likely to move UP to (4, 2) to eat another apple, or possibly move LEFT towards (3, 0) or DOWN towards (4, 0). Its movement does not affect my choices at (9, 4).\n\n**4. Evaluate safe moves for apples and future space:**\n\nI am in a restrictive corner. Both remaining safe moves lead away from the thickest part of my body mass.\n\nA. **UP to (9, 5):**\n*   Pros: Keeps me high up on the board. Moves me slightly closer to (4, 9) and (6, 9), although that is still a long detour. The area (9, 5) is relatively open.\n*   Cons: My body segments (9, 7), (9, 8) are nearby, restricting movement up the 9 column.\n*   Future options from (9, 5):\n    *   UP: (9, 6) [Empty]\n    *   DOWN: (9, 4) [Body segment 1!] -> Deadly.\n    *   LEFT: (8, 5) [Body segment 2!] -> Deadly.\n    *   RIGHT: Wall.\n\nB. **DOWN to (9, 3):**\n*   Pros: Moves me away from the wall and the majority of my body mass. Opens up the possibility of moving LEFT to the center later, or continuing DOWN to the bottom of the board (e.g., towards (7, 0) or (6, 0) if allowed by S1).\n*   Cons: No immediate apples nearby.\n*   Future options from (9, 3):\n    *   UP: (9, 4) [Body segment 1!] -> Deadly.\n    *   DOWN: (9, 2) [Empty]\n    *   LEFT: (8, 3) [Empty]\n    *   RIGHT: Wall.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n\nThe move UP to (9, 5) results in a head position (9, 5) that only has one useful safe move next turn: UP to (9, 6). Any attempt to turn is blocked by my body at (8, 5) and (9, 4). This could lead to being trapped if the tail doesn't move quickly enough.\n\nThe move DOWN to (9, 3) results in a head position (9, 3) that has two useful safe paths next turn: DOWN to (9, 2) and LEFT to (8, 3). This offers better future maneuverability and escapes the corner confinement faster.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the safer and more flexible choice for continuing movement, aiming to keep options open while waiting for my body segments to move out of the way.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 2-3 turns):**\nMove DOWN to (9, 3).\nFrom (9, 3), try to move DOWN to (9, 2) or LEFT to (8, 3). Since (9, 2) and (8, 2) open up the bottom right board, I will aim to move into that area, perhaps towards (7, 0) or (6, 0), depending on S1's movements.\n\nDOWN",

Any of its moves are far from my current location (9, 3).\n\n**4. Evaluate safe moves for apples and future space:**\n\nA. **DOWN to (9, 2):**\n*   Pros: Continues the movement away from the large block of my body segments (8, 4) to (9, 8). Maintains progress down the eastern edge of the board, heading towards (7, 0) and (6, 0).\n*   Cons: Still far from apples.\n*   Future options from (9, 2):\n    *   UP: (9, 3) [Body segment 1!] -> Deadly, unless body moves.\n    *   DOWN: (9, 1) [Empty]\n    *   LEFT: (8, 2) [Empty]\n    *   RIGHT: Wall.\n    *   Outcome: Two safe paths (DOWN, LEFT). Good flexibility.\n\nB. **LEFT to (8, 3):**\n*   Pros: Moves into the main body of the board. Might allow access to apples further left, such as (3, 4), (4, 3). The current tail position is (8, 8). Moving left helps spread out the body.\n*   Cons: Brings me closer to the dense center of the board where S1 operates, although still quite distant.\n*   Future options from (8, 3):\n    *   UP: (8, 4) [Body segment 2!] -> Deadly.\n    *   DOWN: (8, 2) [Empty]\n    *   LEFT: (7, 3) [Empty]\n    *   RIGHT: (9, 3) [Body segment 1!] -> Deadly, unless body moves.\n    *   Outcome: Two safe paths (DOWN, LEFT). Good flexibility.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n\nBoth moves offer equal immediate safety and flexibility (two next-turn options).\n\n*   Moving DOWN to (9, 2) maintains the strategy of clearing the confined corner and moving toward the bottom right.\n*   Moving LEFT to (8, 3) immediately starts heading toward the board center/left.\n\nGiven the density of my body to the north and west of my head (at (9, 4), and (8, 4), (8, 5)), moving LEFT to (8, 3) immediately puts me adjacent to (8, 4), potentially making the next move (UP or RIGHT) immediately fatal due to my moving body segments.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (9, 2), I am adjacent to (9, 3) (my new body segment) and (8, 2) (empty). This isolates me from the restrictive segments at (8, 4) and higher better than (8, 3).\n\nSince my long-term plan was to continue moving DOWN towards the bottom apples ((7, 0), (6, 0)), continuing DOWN to (9, 2) is the most consistent and arguably safer path away from existing self-imposed constraints.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 2-3 turns):**\nMove DOWN to (9, 2). Then from (9, 2), move LEFT to (8, 2) or DOWN to (9, 1), prioritizing movement towards the bottom center of the board where apples (7, 0) and (6, 0) are located. We should be very aware of S1's position, which is currently focused on the (4, Y) column. After S1 eats (4, 3), it might continue UP to (4, 4) or start moving toward the left side.\n\nDOWN",

Determine potential moves from (9, 2) (My Head):**\n\n1. UP: (9, 3) [My Body segment 1! *Deadly*]\n2. DOWN: (9, 1) [Empty]\n3. LEFT: (8, 2) [Empty]\n4. RIGHT: (10, 2) [Into the Wall! *Deadly*]\n\n**2. Check for immediate death conditions (Self and Walls):**\n*   Wall collisions: RIGHT to (10, 2) is illegal.\n*   Own body collision: UP to (9, 3) is illegal.\n\nSafe moves remaining: DOWN (9, 1), LEFT (8, 2).\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake 1 (Head at (4, 3)):**\n\nS1 is operating in the center-left. We are far apart.\n\nS1's candidate moves from (4, 3):\n1. UP: (4, 4) [Apple! Highly likely target.]\n2. DOWN: (4, 2) [Body segment 1! Deadly.]\n3. LEFT: (3, 3) [Apple (2, 3) is nearby, but (3, 3) is empty. Apple (3, 4) is next turn.]\n4. RIGHT: (5, 3) [Body segment 5! Deadly.]\n\nS1 will likely move UP to (4, 4) to eat the apple. Our relative positions guarantee no immediate collision risk.\n\n**4. Evaluate safe moves for apples and future space (from (9, 2)):**\n\nA. **DOWN to (9, 1):**\n*   Pros: Continues the strategic movement towards the lower section of the board. Gets closer to the lower apples (7, 0), (6, 0).\n*   Cons: Still on the high-X edge, which can limit options if the lower corners get crowded.\n*   Future options from (9, 1):\n    *   UP: (9, 2) [Body segment 1!] -> Deadly.\n    *   DOWN: (9, 0) [Empty]\n    *   LEFT: (8, 1) [Empty]\n    *   Outcome: Two safe paths (DOWN, LEFT). Good flexibility.\n\nB. **LEFT to (8, 2):**\n*   Pros: Moves inward, opening up better access to apples and potentially separating my head from the long trail of my body along X=9.\n*   Cons: Doesn't move as directly towards the bottom apples, although it maintains momentum down the Y-axis if followed by a DOWN move. It also places me adjacent to two new empty squares: (7, 2) and (8, 1).\n*   Future options from (8, 2):\n    *   UP: (8, 3) [Empty, but will be my Body segment 1 next turn if I move there now.] (Wait, (8, 3) is empty now, the body is (9, 3), (9, 4)...). The body segment is (9, 3). If I move to (8, 2), my new segments are (9, 2), (9, 3)...\n        *   (8, 3) [Empty/Safe]\n    *   DOWN: (8, 1) [Empty]\n    *   LEFT: (7, 2) [Empty]\n    *   RIGHT: (9, 2) [Body segment 1!] -> Deadly.\n    *   Outcome: Three safe paths (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Excellent flexibility.\n\n**5. Decision Rationale:**\n\nMoving LEFT to (8, 2) offers significantly better future flexibility (3 safe moves vs 2 for DOWN). It also begins the process of drawing the snake out of the corner, utilizing the available space. From (8, 2), I can aim DOWN to (8, 1) and then towards (7, 0) or (6, 0).\n\nLet's check the distance to the nearest target apples (7, 0) and (6, 0).\nFrom (9, 2):\n*   To (7, 0): Needs 2 LEFT + 2 DOWN (4 moves minimum)\n*   To (6, 0): Needs 3 LEFT + 2 DOWN (5 moves minimum)\n\nIf I move LEFT to (8, 2): Distance to (7, 0) is 1 LEFT + 2 DOWN (3 moves).\nIf I move DOWN to (9, 1): Distance to (7, 0) is 2 LEFT + 1 DOWN (3 moves).\n\nBoth moves are equally efficient in distance, but LEFT to (8, 2) is safer due to higher options count for the next turn, and it avoids getting stuck along the edge.\n\nI choose LEFT.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 2-3 turns):**\nMove LEFT to (8, 2). Then aim DOWN to (8, 1) and eventually LEFT to (7, 1) or (6, 1) to access the apples at (7, 0) and (6, 0). We must remain aware of S1's growing length and potential movement towards the center-bottom.\n\nLEFT",

The move LEFT to (8, 2) was executed.\n\n**Current Goal:** Continue moving down and left to access the clustering of apples on the bottom rows.\n\n**1. Determine potential moves from (8, 2) (My Head):**\n\n1. UP: (8, 3) [Empty]\n2. DOWN: (8, 1) [Empty]\n3. LEFT: (7, 2) [Empty]\n4. RIGHT: (9, 2) [My Body segment 1! *Deadly*]\n\n**2. Check for immediate death conditions (Self, Walls, Enemy Bodies):**\n\n*   Wall collisions: None.\n*   Own body collision: RIGHT to (9, 2) is illegal.\n*   Enemy body collision: S1 body is far away.\n\nSafe moves remaining: UP (8, 3), DOWN (8, 1), LEFT (7, 2).\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake 1 (Head at (4, 4)):**\n\nS1 is in the center, likely having just eaten the apple at (4, 4) (assuming last turn S1 moved UP from (4, 3) to (4, 4)).\n\nS1's candidate moves from (4, 4):\n1. UP: (4, 5) [Apple!] - Highly likely target.\n2. DOWN: (4, 3) [Body segment 1! *Deadly*]\n3. LEFT: (3, 4) [Apple!] - Also highly likely.\n4. RIGHT: (5, 4) [Empty]\n\nS1 is at an intersection and has two immediate apples: (4, 5) and (3, 4).\n*   If S1 moves UP to (4, 5), it secures another apple.\n*   If S1 moves LEFT to (3, 4), it secures another apple.\n\nIt is impossible for S1 to collide with us this turn, as the minimum distance is large (4 units on X, 2 units on Y).\n\n**4. Evaluate safe moves for apples and future space (from (8, 2)):**\n\nWe are 3 moves away from (7, 0). We need to prioritize movement into the relatively empty lower-left area.\n\nA. **DOWN to (8, 1):**\n*   Pros: Direct aggressive movement towards the bottom row apples (7, 0), (6, 0). Leads directly to (8, 0) or (7, 1) next turn.\n*   Future options from (8, 1): (8, 0) [Empty], (7, 1) [Empty], (9, 1) [Empty]. (3 options).\n\nB. **LEFT to (7, 2):**\n*   Pros: Moves inward, closer to the center of the board. Keeps the option to move DOWN open immediately.\n*   Future options from (7, 2): (7, 3) [Empty], (6, 2) [Apple!], (7, 1) [Empty]. (3 options, one apple target).\n*   This places me one move closer to (6, 2) which is a strong apple target.\n\nC. **UP to (8, 3):**\n*   Pros: Keeps distance from my body segments (8, 4), (8, 5)...\n*   Cons: Moves away from the apple clusters at the bottom (2, 1), (3, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0). This is counter to the established strategy.\n\n**Comparison of DOWN vs. LEFT:**\n\n*   **Move DOWN (8, 1):** Gets us closer to (7, 0) and (6, 0).\n    *   (8, 2) -> (8, 1) -> (7, 1) or (8, 0).\n    *   Distance to (7, 0) = 1 LEFT + 1 DOWN = 2 moves.\n    *   Distance to (6, 0) = 2 LEFT + 1 DOWN = 3 moves.\n    *   Nearest apple: (2, 1) at dist M=5. (7, 0) at dist M=3.\n\n*   **Move LEFT (7, 2):** Gets us closer to (6, 2) (Apple).\n    *   (8, 2) -> (7, 2) -> (6, 2) [Eat Apple!]\n    *   Distance to (6, 2) = 1 LEFT + 0 DOWN = 1 move.\n    *   Distance to (7, 0) = 0 LEFT + 2 DOWN = 2 moves.\n\nMoving LEFT to (7, 2) allows us to grab the apple at (6, 2) next turn, which is critical since S1 is pulling ahead in score. Eating an apple keeps our length up and helps close the score gap. This path is efficient and leads to an immediate reward.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. Move LEFT to (7, 2).\n2. Move LEFT again to (6, 2) to eat the apple.\n3. Once the apple is eaten, we will be at (6, 2) and can decide whether to move down towards (6, 0) or continue left/upwards.\n\nI choose LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

(Total 20 apples)\n\n**Previous Plan Review:**\nThe previous plan was:\n1. Move LEFT to (7, 2). (Executed successfully)\n2. Move LEFT again to (6, 2) to eat the apple.\n\nWe are now at step 2 of the plan.\n\n**1. Determine potential moves from (7, 2) (My Head):**\n\n1. UP: (7, 3) [Empty] - S1 body segment (7, 5) is far.\n2. DOWN: (7, 1) [Empty]\n3. LEFT: (6, 2) [Apple!]\n4. RIGHT: (8, 2) [My Body segment 1! *Deadly*]\n\n**2.

Analyze Enemy Snake 1 (Head at (4, 5)):**\n\nS1 just ate an apple and is likely looking for the next available apple.\nApples near S1: (5, 7), (4, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 4). S1 has high density options in the center-left.\n\nS1's candidate moves from (4, 5):\n1. UP: (4, 6) [Apple?] No, (4, 6) is empty.\n2. DOWN: (4, 4) [Body segment 1! *Deadly*]\n3. LEFT: (3, 5) [Empty]\n4. RIGHT: (5, 5) [S1 Body segment! *Deadly*] Wait, (5, 5) is empty. S1 body: [(4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5)]. Okay, (5, 5) is safe.\n\nS1's safe moves: UP (4, 6), LEFT (3, 5), RIGHT (5, 5).\nIf S1 moves UP or LEFT, it maintains its position in the apple-rich central column/rows. (4, 6) is empty, but (5, 7) is nearby. (3, 5) is closer to (3, 6) and (3, 7).\n\nS1 is nowhere near my snake (minimum Manhattan distance is 7 - X: 7-4=3, Y: 5-2=3, M=6). No head-on collision danger.\n\n**4. Evaluate safe moves for apples and future space (from (7, 2)):**\n\nA. **LEFT to (6, 2):**\n*   Pros: Immediate apple consumption! Closes the score gap (8 -> 9 vs 11). Secures position near other bottom apples (6, 0), (7, 0).\n*   Future from (6, 2): (5, 2) [S1 body segment *Deadly*!], (6, 3) [S1 body segment *Deadly*!], (7, 2) [Body segment 1! *Deadly*], (6, 1) [Empty], (6, 0) [Apple!].\n*   We only have one safe move after eating the apple: DOWN to (6, 1). This is a tight spot but leads immediately to another apple opportunity.\n\nB. **DOWN to (7, 1):**\n*   Pros: Keeps general momentum towards (7, 0).\n*   Cons: Delays the apple at (6, 2).\n\nC. **UP to (7, 3):**\n*   Pros: Keeps options open.\n*   Cons: Moves away from immediate apple targets.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nThe immediate target (6, 2) is a highly beneficial move. It is safe and directly grants a score increase.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6, 2), our new head will be (6, 2). Our body will occupy (7, 2).\nNext turn (Turn 17), from (6, 2):\n*   UP (6, 3): S1 body. DEAD.\n*   DOWN (6, 1): Safe. Leads to (6, 0) (Apple).\n*   LEFT (5, 2): S1 body. DEAD.\n*   RIGHT (7, 2): My body. DEAD.\n\nIf we commit to LEFT, we must commit to DOWN immediately after to pursue (6, 0). This is a forced path for two turns, but it yields two apples safely. This is an excellent sequence.\n\nI choose LEFT to eat the apple at (6, 2).\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 2 turns):**\n1. T16: Move LEFT to (6, 2) (Eat Apple).\n2. T17: Move DOWN to (6, 1).\n3. T18: Access (6, 0) (Apple) or (7, 0) (Apple).\n\nLEFT",

(Total 19 apples)\n\n**Previous Plan Review:**\nPrevious plan:\n1. T16: Move LEFT to (6, 2) (Eat Apple). (Executed successfully)\n2. T17: Move DOWN to (6, 1). (Current turn goal)\n3. T18: Access (6, 0) (Apple) or (7, 0) (Apple).\n\n**1. Determine potential moves from (6, 2) (My Head):**\n\n1. UP: (6, 3) [Snake 1 Body segment! (S1 B9) *Deadly*]\n2. DOWN: (6, 1) [Empty] - Leads towards (6, 0) Apple and (7, 0) Apple.\n3. LEFT: (5, 2) [Snake 1 Body segment! (S1 B7) *Deadly*]\n4. RIGHT: (7, 2) [My Body segment 1! *Deadly*]\n\n**2. Check for immediate death conditions (Self, Walls, Enemy Bodies):**\n\n*   Wall collisions: None.\n*   Own body collision: RIGHT to (7, 2) is illegal.\n*   Enemy body collision: UP to (6, 3) is illegal. LEFT to (5, 2) is illegal.\n\nSafe move remaining: DOWN (6, 1).\n\n**3. Analyze Enemy Snake 1 (Head at (3, 5)):**\n\nS1 moved LEFT last turn, likely targeting the cluster of apples around (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 4).\nPotential moves for S1 from (3, 5):\n1. UP: (3, 6) [Apple!]\n2. DOWN: (3, 4) [Apple!]\n3. LEFT: (2, 5) [Apple!]\n4. RIGHT: (4, 5) [Body segment 1! *Deadly*]\n\nS1 has three immediate apple targets! This is critical. S1 will almost certainly pick one of these.\n\n*   If S1 moves UP (3, 6): opens up (3, 5).\n*   If S1 moves DOWN (3, 4): opens up (3, 5).\n*   If S1 moves LEFT (2, 5): opens up (3, 5).\n\nThe distance between my head (6, 2) and S1's head (3, 5) is Manhattan 3 + 3 = 6. No head-on collision threat.\n\n**4. Evaluate the only safe move: DOWN to (6, 1).**\n\n*   Pros: Keeps snake alive. Moves towards a high-density apple area (6, 0) and (7, 0). Follows the planned path.\n*   Future from (6, 1) (Turn 18):\n    *   UP: (6, 2) [My Body segment 1! *Deadly*]\n    *   DOWN: (6, 0) [Apple!] - Excellent target!\n    *   LEFT: (5, 1) [Snake 1 Body segment! *Deadly*]\n    *   RIGHT: (7, 1) [Empty]\n\nThe sequence DOWN -> DOWN (to 6, 0) looks secured and safe, yielding another apple.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe only safe move is DOWN to (6, 1). This is optimal as it follows the path to the next apple (6, 0).\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 2 turns):**\n1. T17: Move DOWN to (6, 1). (Ensure survival, setup for T18)\n2. T18: Move DOWN to (6, 0) (Eat Apple).\n3. T19: From (6, 0), move RIGHT to (7, 0) (Apple) or UP to (7, 1) if S1/S1's potential growth does not create an immediate threat further down the board. Given the proximity of (7, 0), RIGHT seems likely for another apple.\n\nDOWN",

Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (6, 0):** EATS AN APPLE. This is highly prioritized. It secures my 10th apple and allows growth.\n    *   Future position: (6, 0).\n    *   It also immediately positions me near the (7, 0) apple.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 1):** Empty space.

Analyze Enemy Snake 1 (Head at (3, 6)):**\n\nS1 just ate an apple at (3, 6) and is now chasing the cluster: (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9).\nPotential moves for S1 from (3, 6):\n1.

The action space for both snakes is separated.\n\n**5. Final Decision:**\n\nMoving DOWN to (6, 0) is the optimal choice as it secures an immediate apple and sets up for the next apple at (7, 0) or continued movement around the bottom wall.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 2 turns):**\n1. T18: Move DOWN to (6, 0) (Eat Apple). (Current turn goal)\n2. T19: From (6, 0), evaluate targets.\n    *   RIGHT to (7, 0) (Apple).

Length is now 11.)\n*   Body: [(6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6)]\n*   Apples Collected: 10\n\nEnemy snake (ID 1)\n*   Head: (3, 7) (S1 likely moved from (3, 6) to (3, 7) and ate an apple). Length is now 14.\n*   Body: [(3, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)] (Note: I need to account for S1's move *this turn*. S1 Head at (3, 7) means S1's old tail at (6, 5) moved to (6, 6) if it didn't eat, but S1 *did* eat (3, 7) this turn, so its old tail (6, 5) stays put IF it didn't grow. Wait, the board state provided shows the result *after* the previous turn's moves were executed. Let's rely on the provided turn 19 state.)\n\n*   S1 Head: (3, 7), Body: [(3, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), ..., (6, 5)] (The listed body length is 13, which means S1 has grown to length 14 after eating an apple, likely at (3, 7). The listed body is slightly outdated or incomplete based on the head position and growth. Assuming standard Snake rules, the body listed is the *pre-movement* body from T18, and the head moved to (3, 7) on T19. Since the game state reflects the start of Turn 19, the body list **includes** the segment S1 just moved out of (3, 6) and the head is now confirmed at (3, 7). S1's length is 14. S1's tail is at (6, 5). If S1 *eats* this turn, the tail stays, otherwise, the tail segment (6, 5) is freed.)\n\n*   **Crucial Correction:** The provided state is the *start* of the current turn (Turn 19). My analysis of the last turn confirmed I moved to (6, 0) and ate an apple. The current state reflects my head at (6, 0) and my new long body. Snake 1's head at (3, 7) means they *also* moved last turn, likely eating the apple at (3, 7). S1's body, therefore, has length 14. S1's tail is at (6, 5).\n\nApples remaining: (3, 4), (4, 9), (0, 3), (7, 0), (2, 3), (6, 9), (0, 4), (3, 0), (4, 8), (3, 8), (0, 8), (0, 5), (2, 1), (5, 7), (1, 1), (9, 8), (2, 5), (5, 6), (9, 6), (0, 0). (Wait, (6, 0) was eaten by me. (3, 7) was eaten by S1. The list should be checked against the provided visual board.)\n\n**Board Check (Focusing on Apples and Snake positions):**\nThe visualization confirms:\n*   My head (0) is at (6, 0).\n*   S1 head (1) is at (3, 7).\n*   Apple (A) nearby: (7, 0). This is my immediate apple target.\n\nVisible apples in my path:\n1. (7, 0) - Right, 1 step.\n2. (3, 0) - Far Left/Up.\n3. (2, 1), (1, 1), (0, 0) - Further left.\n\nS1 is heading UP the 3-column towards (3, 8).\n\n**1. Determine potential moves from (6, 0) (My Head):**\n\n1. UP: (6, 1) [My Body segment 1! *Deadly*]\n2. DOWN: (6, -1) [Wall! *Deadly*]\n3. LEFT: (5, 0) [Empty] - Leads towards (3, 0).\n4. RIGHT: (7, 0) [Apple!] - Highest priority target.\n\n**2. Check for immediate death conditions (Self, Walls, Enemy Bodies):**\n\n*   Wall collisions: DOWN is illegal.\n*   Own body collision: UP to (6, 1) is illegal.\n*   Enemy body collision: S1 is far away. No immediate threat.\n\nSafe moves remaining: RIGHT (7, 0) and LEFT (5, 0).\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 0):** EATS AN APPLE. This is the optimal move. It grants another point and moves me along the bottom edge.\n    *   Future position: (7, 0).\n*   **Move LEFT to (5, 0):** Empty space. Defers apple collection.\n\n**4. Analyze Enemy Snake 1 (Head at (3, 7)):**\n\nS1 is likely moving UP towards the cluster of apples at (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9).\nPotential dangerous moves for S1 (those that could threaten my path, assuming S1 continues its target):\n1. UP: (3, 8) [Apple!] - Highly likely.\n2. RIGHT: (4, 7) [Empty] - Less likely, as (3, 8) is a direct apple.\n\nS1 is not close enough to threaten my immediate move to (7, 0) or create a head-on collision.\n\n**5. Final Decision:**\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7, 0) is the best move as it secures an immediate apple and keeps my snake safely positioned near the bottom boundary.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 2 turns):**\n1. T19: Move RIGHT to (7, 0) (Eat Apple). (Current turn goal)\n2. T20: From (7, 0), the only open direct path away from the wall is UP to (7, 1) or RIGHT to (8, 0).\n    *   (8, 0) is empty. (9, 0) is empty. My long body [(6, 1) to (8, 6)] does not yet block this path. I can safely sweep the bottom and then decide whether to go up the 8/9 column or move towards (9, 8).\n\nRIGHT",

Length is now 12.)\n*   Body: [(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6)]\n*   Apples collected: 11\n*   Tail is currently at (8, 6). Since I ate, the tail segment (8, 6) *does not move* this turn.\n\nEnemy snake (ID 1):\n*   Head: (3, 8) (Moved from (3, 7). S1 likely ate the apple at (3, 8). Length is 15 based on scoring difference unless 3, 8 wasn't an apple.)\n*   Apples collected: 14.\n*   S1's head is now at (3, 8).\n*   S1's body: [(3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)]\n*   S1's tail is at (6, 5).\n\nBoard state review:\nApples (A) visible relevant to my position (7, 0): (3, 0), (0, 0), (8, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1). The concentration of apples is heavily on the left and upper boundaries.\n\n**1. Determine potential moves from (7, 0) (My Head):**\n\n1. UP: (7, 1) [Empty] - Leads towards the upper board.\n2. DOWN: (7, -1) [Wall! *Deadly*]\n3. LEFT: (6, 0) [My Body segment 1! *Deadly*]\n4. RIGHT: (8, 0) [Empty] - Keeps me along the bottom edge.\n\n**2. Check for immediate death conditions:**\n\n*   Wall collisions: DOWN is illegal.\n*   Own body collision: LEFT to (6, 0) is illegal (moving backwards).\n*   Enemy body collision: None imminent. S1 is on the other side of the board (near (3, 8)).\n\nSafe moves remaining: UP (7, 1) and RIGHT (8, 0).\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move UP to (7, 1):**\n    *   This is a strong move to get off the boundary.\n    *   There is an apple at (8, 1) one step away from (7, 1) if I move RIGHT next turn.\n    *   It leads away from the enemy's general direction, though S1 is currently far away.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (8, 0):**\n    *   Keeps me on the bottom boundary.\n    *   (8, 0) is empty. (9, 0) is empty.\n    *   The snake would then need to move UP from (9, 0) to get to (9, 1)/(9, 2). My body blocks (9, 2).\n    *   If I move RIGHT, I can then go UP to (8, 1) next turn to eat an apple.\n\n**Comparison of UP vs. RIGHT:**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 1)**: Gets me closer to the overall center. Next turn, I can move RIGHT to (8, 1) (Apple) or UP to (7, 2) (Body segment!). No, (7, 2) is my body! So from (7, 1), I must go RIGHT to (8, 1) (Apple) or LEFT to (6, 1) (Body segment!).\n    *   *If I move UP to (7, 1):*\n        *   T21: Move RIGHT to (8, 1) (Apple). Safe.\n        *   T21: Move UP to (7, 2) is **deadly** (My body).\n        *   T21: Move LEFT to (6, 1) is **deadly** (My body).\n        This path immediately leads to one safe move (RIGHT), which is towards the apple.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (8, 0)**: Stays on the boundary, less flexible, but leads to an apple.\n    *   *If I move RIGHT to (8, 0):*\n        *   T21: Move UP to (8, 1) (Apple). Safe.\n        *   T21: Move RIGHT to (9, 0). Safe.\n        *   T21: Move LEFT to (7, 0) is **deadly** (My body).\n    This path also leads to an immediate apple opportunity (UP) or continued boundary movement (RIGHT).\n\nBoth paths offer an apple pickup on Turn 21.\n\nLet's look at the body arrangement around the (8, Y) column:\nMy Body segments are at (8, 2), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6).\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 0), my path UP to (8, 1) (apple), and then (8, 2) to continue UP is blocked. I would have to go from (8, 1) to (9, 1) or (7, 1). This is a potential trap.\n\nIf I move UP to (7, 1), my path is much cleaner:\nT20: (7, 0) -> (7, 1)\nT21: (7, 1) -> (8, 1) (Apple).\nT22: From (8, 1):\n    *   I want to avoid (8, 2) (Body).\n    *   I can go RIGHT to (9, 1).\n    *   I can go UP to (8, 2) - **BLOCKED**\n    *   I can go LEFT to (7, 1) - **BLOCKED**\n    *   I can go DOWN to (8, 0).\n\nThe path UP to (7, 1) seems strategically better for long-term expansion as it targets the (8, 1) apple immediately while giving more room to maneuver around my dense body segments running up the 8-column.\n\nLet's confirm the tail position and potential freeing up of space.\nMy current body has 11 segments. Head (7, 0). Tail (8, 6).\nIf I move to (7, 1) (no apple), the tail (8, 6) moves to (8, 5) (or the previous segment, depending on how tail enumeration works, but we assume (8, 6) is freed up if no apple is eaten). Since I *did* eat last turn, the segment (8, 6) *is* the last segment. If I move to (7, 1) and do *not* eat, the body shrinks, and (8, 6) is freed.\n\nThe game state shows my body with 11 segments: [(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6)].\nThe head is (7, 0). Total length 12.\nLast turn, I ate an apple, so my length increased. This turn, if I move and don't eat, the segment (8, 6) will be freed.\n\nIf I choose UP to (7, 1):\nT20: (7, 0) -> (7, 1) [Empty]. (8, 6) is freed.\nT21: (7, 1) -> (8, 1) [Apple]. (8, 5) is NOT freed. Length 12 -> 13.\n\nThis path (UP, then RIGHT) looks like the best way to secure the apple at (8, 1) without getting immediately trapped by my own body segments in the (8, Y) column. I will briefly be next to (7, 2), but I will move away from it.\n\n**4. Enemy Consideration (S1 at (3, 8)):**\nS1 is likely moving around the top left quadrant. S1's next move is likely UP to (3, 9) or RIGHT to (4, 8) (Apple!). The movement of S1 does not currently interfere with my pursuit of the (8, 1) apple.\n\n**5. Final Decision:** UP towards (7, 1) provides the best intermediate stepping stone to secure the apple at (8, 1) and maintain flexibility.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 2-3 turns):**\n1. T20: Move UP to (7, 1). (Frees up (8, 6)).\n2. T21: Move RIGHT to (8, 1) (Eat Apple).\n3. T22: From (8, 1), try to snake down/right towards (9, 1) or sweep far right (9, 8) and (9, 6) apples. Must avoid (8, 2) and (7, 2). I can go RIGHT to (9, 1) or DOWN to (8, 0). Going RIGHT to (9, 1) is better for further mapping out the board.\n\nUP",

RIGHT takes me straight onto the apple at (4,8), keeping open the corridor along the top row to continue to (4,9) and beyond without boxing myself in, and there are no nearby enemy heads that can contest that cell.\n\nPlan: After grabbing (4,8), continue clearing the nearby apples at (4,9) and then sweep over toward the (6,9)/(8,9) cluster before descending to the remaining apples on the left side, keeping the upper corridor open so I can escape if an opponent approaches.\n\nRIGHT",

Coordinates 0-9.\n\n**1. Determine potential moves from (8, 1) (My Head):**\n\n1. UP: (8, 2)\n2. DOWN: (8, 0)\n3. LEFT: (7, 1)\n4. RIGHT: (9, 1)\n\n**2. Check for immediate death conditions:**\n\n*   **Wall collisions:** None.\n*   **Own body collision:**\n    *   UP (8, 2): Segment 7 of my body. **DEADLY.**\n    *   LEFT (7, 1): Segment 1 of my body (moving backwards). **DEADLY.**\n*   **Enemy body collision:** S1 is far away (near Y=9). No immediate threat.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\nThe only safe moves are DOWN to (8, 0) and RIGHT to (9, 1).\n\n*   (8, 0): Empty street. This position is close to the bottom right corner.\n*   (9, 1): Empty street. This position moves along the right edge, giving access to the column of apples at X=9 (specifically (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)).\n\n**4. Analyze the Safe Moves (Greedy/Strategic):**\n\n*   **Moving DOWN to (8, 0):**\n    *   Pro: Safe.\n    *   Con: It walls me in slightly. From (8, 0), the only way forward is RIGHT to (9, 0) (Apple A!) or back UP to (8, 1) (which would then be blocked by my segment 1, (8, 1)). This seems okay because (9, 0) is an apple right there. The apple at (9, 0) is actually non-existent; the apples are at (0, 0), (1, 0), (3, 0). (8, 0) is empty.\n    *   Let's check the map again for (8, 0): Empty (.).\n    *   If I move DOWN to (8, 0), my next safe moves are (9, 0) (empty) or (7, 0) (my body). It leads to a tight spot.\n\n*   **Moving RIGHT to (9, 1):**\n    *   Pro: Safe. Keeps me along the edge. From (9, 1), I have options UP to (9, 2) (my body) or RIGHT, which is off board (illegal). I actually have options UP and DOWN.\n    *   Let's re-examine options from (9, 1):\n        *   UP: (9, 2) [My Body segment 8! **DEADLY**]\n        *   DOWN: (9, 0) [Empty]\n        *   LEFT: (8, 1) [My Body segment 1! **DEADLY**]\n        *   RIGHT: Off board. **DEADLY**\n\nThis means moving RIGHT to (9, 1) also leads to an immediate tight spot, where only DOWN to (9, 0) is safe next turn.\n\n**5. Comparing the Options:**\n\n*   Path A: (8, 1) -> DOWN -> (8, 0)\n    *   T23 options from (8, 0): UP (body (8, 1)), LEFT (body (7, 0)), RIGHT (9, 0, empty), DOWN (off board). Only RIGHT to (9, 0) is safe.\n    *   T24 options from (9, 0): UP (9, 1, empty), LEFT (8, 0, body), RIGHT (off board). UP to (9, 1) is safe.\n\n*   Path B: (8, 1) -> RIGHT -> (9, 1)\n    *   T23 options from (9, 1): UP (body (9, 2)), LEFT (body (8, 1)), DOWN (9, 0, empty). Only DOWN to (9, 0) is safe.\n    *   T24 options from (9, 0): UP (9, 1, body), LEFT (8, 0, empty), RIGHT (off board). LEFT to (8, 0) is safe.\n\nBoth paths force me to the same two cells (8, 0) and (9, 0) over the next two mandatory moves, essentially cycling through the corner.\n\nLet's look for apples near these positions:\n(9, 0) is EMPTY.\n(8, 0) is EMPTY.\n(1, 0) and (0, 0) are Apples far away to the left.\n(3, 0) is an Apple further left.\n\nHowever, moving RIGHT towards (9, 1) sets me up on the right flank immediately, which is where the major apple clusters (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8) are. Although my immediate options are constrained, moving RIGHT now seems to position me better for the long run if I manage to escape the corner upwards.\n\nLet's consider the exit possibilities from the (9, 0)/(8, 0) loop:\nIf I go (8, 1) -> (9, 1) -> (9, 0).\nFrom (9, 0), T24 move must be LEFT to (8, 0) (or wait for the tail to move).\nWait, my tail is at (8, 5). It takes 13 moves for my body to release cells.\n\n*Recalculating freedom due to body moves:*\nLength is 13. Tail is at T(8, 5).\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 1):\nMy body is [(7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5)]. The tail moves from (8, 5) to (8, 4). (8, 5) becomes free.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 0):\nMy body is [(7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5)]. The tail moves from (8, 5) to (8, 4). (8, 5) becomes free.\n\nThe movement of the tail doesn't help me escape the corner quickly. I still effectively have a path through (8, 0) and (9, 0).\n\nLet's stick to the better starting position for future vertical movement. Moving RIGHT puts me on the X=9 border.\n\n(8, 1) -> RIGHT (9, 1).\nNext turn (T23): Must go DOWN to (9, 0).\nNext turn (T24): From (9, 0), must go LEFT to (8, 0).\nNext turn (T25): From (8, 0), must go UP to (8, 1), but (8, 1) is now my segment 4, so that's dead. Wait, this path is deadly!\n\nLet's retrace the body movement for path B: (8, 1) -> RIGHT (9, 1).\nT22 Head: (9, 1). Body: (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5) -> (8, 4) T.\n\nT23 from (9, 1): Must go DOWN to (9, 0).\nT23 Head: (9, 0). Body: (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4). T moves to (9, 4). (8, 4) is free.\n\nT24 from (9, 0): Must go LEFT to (8, 0).\nT24 Head: (8, 0). Body: (9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4). T moves to (9, 3). (9, 4) is free.\n\nT25 from (8, 0):\nOptions: UP (8, 1), RIGHT (9, 0).\n(8, 1) is currently segment 3. Still deadly.\n(9, 0) is currently segment 1. Still deadly (moving backwards).\nThis path is a trap for 3-4 turns until the body clears (9, 1) and (8, 1). Since I only have 13 segments, (8, 1) and (9, 1) will clear relatively quickly (in 13 turns). This is far too long to be constrained to two cells.\n\nI must avoid getting cornered in a 2xY or Xx2 space unless I can clear the body segments faster or there's an apple to grow and clear the tail faster.\n\nLet's re-examine the map:\nFrom (8, 1): DOWN to (8, 0) or RIGHT to (9, 1). Both are essentially corner moves.\n\nIf I choose DOWN to (8, 0):\nT22 Head: (8, 0). Body starts with (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0)....\nT23 from (8, 0): Must go RIGHT to (9, 0).\nT23 Head: (9, 0). Body starts with (8, 0), (8, 1), (7, 1)....\nT24 from (9, 0): Must go UP to (9, 1).\nT24 Head: (9, 1). Body starts with (9, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1)....\nT25 from (9, 1):\nOptions: UP (9, 2, my body!), DOWN (9, 0, my body!), LEFT (8, 1, my body!), RIGHT (Wall).\nThis path is disastrous. It leads to death in T25 unless I grew long enough to clear the segments, which I haven't.\n\n**Conclusion: I cannot move into the (8, 0)-(9, 0)-(9, 1)-(8, 1) quadrant without locking myself in.**\n\nWait, I need to check the exact segment numbers.\nMy current body: H(8, 1) -> S1(7, 1) -> S2(7, 0) -> S3(6, 0) -> S4(6, 1) -> S5(6, 2) -> S6(7, 2) -> S7(8, 2) -> S8(9, 2) -> S9(9, 3) -> S10(9, 4) -> S11(8, 4) -> S12(8, 5) T. (Length 13, 12 body segments).\n\n1. Move RIGHT to (9, 1).\nT22 Head: (9, 1). S1(8, 1). S2(7, 1). S3(7, 0)...\nT23 from (9, 1): Must go DOWN to (9, 0).\nT23 Head: (9, 0). S1(9, 1). S2(8, 1). S3(7, 1)...\nT24 from (9, 0): Must go LEFT to (8, 0).\nT24 Head: (8, 0). S1(9, 0). S2(9, 1). S3(8, 1)...\nT25 from (8, 0):\n(8, 1) is S4. **Deadly.**\n(9, 0) is S1. **Deadly** (moving backwards is disallowed).\n**This path leads to unavoidable internal collision death at T25.**\n\n2. Move DOWN to (8, 0).\nT22 Head: (8, 0). S1(8, 1). S2(7, 1). S3(7, 0)...\nT23 from (8, 0): Must go RIGHT to (9, 0).\nT23 Head: (9, 0). S1(8, 0). S2(8, 1). S3(7, 1)...\nT24 from (9, 0): Must go UP to (9, 1).\nT24 Head: (9, 1). S1(9, 0). S2(8, 0). S3(8, 1)...\nT25 from (9, 1):\n(9, 2) is S8. **Deadly.**\n(9, 0) is S1. **Deadly.**\n(8, 1) is S4. **Deadly.**\n**This path also leads to unavoidable internal collision death at T25.**\n\nIf both immediate safe movements force immediate death 3 turns later, I must look for an alternative path that allows me to move in a broader circuit.\n\nMy head is at (8, 1). Body segments block (8, 2), (7, 1).\n\nWait, the board is clear at (8, 3) and (9, 3). No, (9, 3) is S9.\nThe area above me is heavily congested: (8, 2) is S7, (9, 2) is S8.\n\nLet's look for a path *left* and *up* to escape the corner congestion.\n\n(8, 1) -> Must be DOWN (8, 0) or RIGHT (9, 1). No other safe moves exist.\nIf both safe moves lead to death in 3 turns, it means my current configuration is intrinsically deadly for the next few turns unless I change the structure heavily or grow significantly.\n\nLet's re-examine the current constraints: H(8, 1).\nSafe moves: (8, 0), (9, 1).\n\nWhy must I move like that?\nIf I go to (9, 1) [RIGHT], T23 has (9, 0) DOWN as the only safe move.\nFrom (9, 1): UP (S9, deadly), LEFT (S1, deadly), RIGHT (Wall).\n\nIf I go to (8, 0) [DOWN], T23 has (9, 0) RIGHT as the only safe move.\nFrom (8, 0): UP (S1, deadly), LEFT (S3, deadly), DOWN (Wall).\n\nSo, the next two moves are fixed regardless of my choice:\n(8, 1) -> (8, 0) -> (9, 0) (Path A)\n(8, 1) -> (9, 1) -> (9, 0) (Path B)\n\nBoth paths land the head at (9, 0) at T23.\nAt T24, I must go to the remaining non-body cell:\nIf Path A: (9, 0) -> (9, 1) (UP). At (9, 1), T25 leads to death.\nIf Path B: (9, 0) -> (8, 0) (LEFT). At (8, 0), T25 leads to death.\n\nSince death is inevitable in 3 turns, I choose the path that potentially helps me position better for the future, even if it delays the inevitable slightly or allows for a slim chance of the tail releasing the needed square.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 1), at T23 I am at (9, 0). This is closer to X=9 and may allow me to loop UP the right wall if/when (9, 2) clears.\n\nLet's check when (8, 1) and (9, 1) clear if I don't eat.\nLength L=13.\nIf I make 13 moves without eating, the cells I occupy now will be freed.\n(8, 1) is S1. It will be freed at T22 + 13 = T35.\n(9, 1) (if I move there) becomes S1. It will be freed at T36.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 1):\nT22: Head (9, 1). Body: (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0)... (8, 5) -> (8, 4) T.\nT23: Head (9, 0). Body: (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1)... (8, 4) -> (9, 4) T.\nT24: Head (8, 0). Body: (9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 1)... (9, 4) -> (9, 3) T.\nT25: Head (8, 1) is S4. Death.\n\nWait, my T25 calculation was based on assuming I have to choose between only four surrounding cells.\nT25 from (8, 0). Body segments: (9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1).\nSafe moves are blocked. I die.\n\nIs there any benefit to going to (9, 1) over (8, 0) when both result in forced death?\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 1), I stay along the X=9 wall, which leads north to a cluster of apples. If I move DOWN to (8, 0), I am stuck internally on X=8 and X=9.\n\nSince immediate death is unavoidable given the current body topology and the lack of adjacent open space, I will choose the move that minimizes the distance to the high-value apples (RIGHT). If I survive T25, I'm better positioned.\n\nI must move RIGHT or DOWN. I choose RIGHT for better spatial orientation in the long run.\n\nRIGHT\n**I will create a short plan note to check if I made a mistake in the path analysis next turn, but for now, based on the calculation of unavoidable death, picking the path that positions me closer to the high-value apple cluster at X=9 is the best strategy.**\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next few turns):**\nThe analysis shows unavoidable death at T25 due to self-trapping in the corner if I follow either of the only two safe moves (RIGHT or DOWN). Assuming the calculation is correct, choose RIGHT to (9, 1) to maximize future options should an enemy snake die, or if there is a mistake in the calculation. The path will be (9, 1) -> (9, 0) -> (8, 0). I need to check T25 options carefully next turn.\nRIGHT",

Check for immediate death conditions (T23):**\n\n*   **Wall collisions:** RIGHT is deadly.\n*   **Own body collision:**\n    *   UP (9, 2): Segment 9 of my body. **DEADLY.**\n    *   LEFT (8, 1): Segment 1 of my body (moving backwards). **DEADLY.**\n*   **Enemy body collision:** S1 is far away. No immediate threat.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\nThe only safe move is DOWN to (9, 0).\n\n*   (9, 0): Empty space (.). This is not an apple.\n\n**4. Check for Head-on Collisions (Enemy Head (5, 9)):**\n\nThe enemy is far away and moving generally along the top edge (Y=9). There is no risk of a head-on collision this turn.\n\n**5. Analysis of the Forced Move (DOWN to (9, 0)):**\n\nAs anticipated in the previous turn's rationale, this move takes me into the corner. I must now carefully evaluate T24 to ensure I escape the self-trap scenario identified previously.\n\n**Projected T24 State (Assuming DOWN to (9, 0)):**\nNew Head: (9, 0)\nNew Body: [(9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4)]\nTail frees (8, 4).

LEFT: (8, 0) - Empty. **SAFE.** (Note: My previous analysis had a cell at (8, 0). Let's confirm (8, 0) is empty on the current board: Yes, it is a period.).\n4. RIGHT: Off board. **DEADLY**.\n\nSo, at T24, I am forced to move LEFT to (8, 0). This confirms Path B from the previous rationale: (8, 1) -> (9, 1) -> (9, 0) -> (8, 0).\n\n**Projected T25 State (Assuming LEFT to (8, 0)):**\nNew Head: (8, 0)\nNew Body: [(9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), ...]\nTail frees (9, 4).

RIGHT: (9, 0) - Segment 1. **DEADLY** (Moving backwards).\n\nAs calculated previously, this path leads to immediate self-collision death at T25.\n\n**Let's re-examine if (8, 0) or (9, 0) is an apple.**\nApples: (3, 4), (0, 3), (2, 3), (6, 9), (0, 4), (3, 0), (0, 8), (0, 5), (2, 1), (5, 7), (1, 1), (9, 8), (2, 5), (5, 6), (9, 6), (0, 0), (8, 9), (9, 7), (1, 0), (3, 3)\n\nNeither (9, 0) nor (8, 0) are apples. My snake does not grow, and the length remains 13.\n\n**Can I survive T25?**\nT25 options from (8, 0):\nMy body segments currently surrounding (8, 0) are: (9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0).\n*   Right (9, 0): Deadly (S1).\n*   Up (8, 1): Deadly (S3).\n*   Left (7, 0): Deadly (S5).\n*   Down: Deadly (Wall).\n\nWait, the list of segments is ordered Head-to-Tail.\nT24 Head (8, 0).\nBody: S1(9, 0), S2(9, 1), S3(8, 1), S4(7, 1), S5(7, 0).\n(8, 1) is S3.\n(7, 0) is S5.\n\nWe only crash into S1 if we move directly backward.\nWe crash into S2, S3, ... if we move into their location.\n\nAt T25, if I move:\n1. UP to (8, 1): I hit S3. **DEAD.**\n2. LEFT to (7, 0): I hit S5. **DEAD.**\n3. RIGHT to (9, 0): I hit S1. **DEAD** (Moving backwards).\n\nThe previous analysis holds: I am facing unavoidable death on T25 if I continue this path. Since I have only one safe move now (DOWN), I must take it, and hope that either:\na) I miscalculated the body segment movement or position (unlikely, I checked both possible cornering moves in the previous turn).\nb) An enemy snake dies and shortens the game unexpectedly.\nc) There is an apple I missed that allows me to grow and clear segments faster (I checked for apples; there are none).\nd) The tail clears a key segment like (8, 1) faster than expected (requires 13 moves).\n\nThe path is forced. I must proceed DOWN.\n\nFinal forced move: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

Moving backwards. **DEADLY.**\n    *   LEFT (8, 0): Empty space (.). Safe for now.\n*   **Enemy body collision:** Enemy is far away at the top edge. No immediate threat.\n*   **Head-on collision:** Enemy head is at (6, 9). No possibility of immediate head-on crash.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\nThe only safe move is LEFT to (8, 0).\n\n**4. Analysis of the Forced Move (LEFT to (8, 0)):**\n\nAs anticipated in the previous turn's rationale, this path leads to a potential self-trap at turn T25.\n\n*   Current Head: (9, 0). Move LEFT to (8, 0).\n*   (8, 0) is not an apple. Length remains 13.\n*   New Head: (8, 0).\n*   New Body: [(9, 0), (9, 1), (8, 1), (7, 1), (7, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 3)].\n*   Tail clears (9, 4).\n\n**Projected T25 State (Options from (8, 0)):**\n\n1. UP to (8, 1): This is the 3rd segment of the new body. (S3: (8, 1)). **DEADLY.**\n2. DOWN to (8, -1): Wall. **DEADLY.**\n3. LEFT to (7, 0): This is the 5th segment of the new body. (S5: (7, 0)). **DEADLY.**\n4. RIGHT to (9, 0): This is the 1st segment of the new body. (S1: (9, 0)). Moving backwards. **DEADLY.**\n\nThe previous analysis holds true: T25 appears to be unavoidable death due to self-trapping in the (7, 0) - (8, 0) - (9, 0) corner.\n\n**Mitigation Check:**\nIs there any possible move the enemy snake could make that causes it to die or frees up a critical path by T25?\nThe enemy (6, 9) seems to be moving along the top edge or consolidating its massive body mass. It is not currently posing a threat that could help or hinder my local situation.\n\nSince only one move is currently safe, I must take it, even knowing the dire consequences for the next turn.\n\n**Long-term Plan/Strategy Note (T25 Onwards):**\nIf the configuration calculated for T25 is correct, the snake dies. I must assume the calculation is correct based on the provided state data. The immediate priority is survival T24.\n\nLEFT",

The game will resolve your death.\"\n\nSince all moves lead to fatality, I must select one direction. Strategically, if I am going to die, I should choose a move that possibly clears up space or puts the dying head in a less critical location, though it makes no difference to the game outcome for me this turn.\n\nLet's pick the move I was forced into previously: **LEFT** (7, 0) for consistency, although any choice ends the snake's life.\n\n**Short-term Plan/Strategy Note:**\nThe snake dies this turn (T25) due to self-trapping in the corner (7,0)-(8,0)-(9,0).
