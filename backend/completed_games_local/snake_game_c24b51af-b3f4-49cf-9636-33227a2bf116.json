Right from (0,5) to (1,5) looks safe then, but planning is limited.  \n\nDOWN: (0, 3) \u2013 eat apple, grow, next turn my body will be [(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4)], head at (0,3), so from there I could go UP (back to (0,4)?

UP (3,4): moves toward center, but away from most apples except maybe (5,8). Keeps options open.  \n2. DOWN (3,2): closest apple is at (5,2) \u2192 moves slightly closer; also near apple at (0,2) but far.  \n3. RIGHT (4,3): towards apple at (5,1) or (5,2), but enemy is at (6,3) so possible head-on collision risk if enemy moves LEFT to (5,3) or (6,3)\u2192? Wait, enemy can't move to (6,3) because already there, but enemy's possible moves:   \nEnemy #1 head (6,3): check neighbor cells:  \n- UP (6,4) is its own body \u2192 unsafe for enemy.  \n- DOWN (6,2) safe for enemy.  \n- LEFT (5,3) safe for enemy.  \n- RIGHT (7,3) safe for enemy.  \nSo enemy could move LEFT to (5,3) \u2014 that\u2019s exactly where I\u2019d be heading if I go RIGHT now (I go to (4,3), then next turn maybe to (5,3) if safe). If enemy moves LEFT to (5,3) now, it won\u2019t collide with me this turn, but next turn we could collide if I go to (5,3) when enemy is already there. But this turn, if I go RIGHT to (4,3) and enemy goes LEFT to (5,3), that's fine \u2014 no collision *this* turn. Danger is future collision.  \n\nAlso (5,1) apple is tempting: if I go RIGHT to (4,3), then next turn DOWN to (4,2), then RIGHT to (5,2) or (5,1) if possible.  \n\n**Best safe move toward apples:**  \nApple at (5,2) \u2014 from (3,3) the fastest is RIGHT+DOWN or DOWN+RIGHT. So going RIGHT is good first step, but so is DOWN.  \n\nLet\u2019s compare:  \n- If I go DOWN to (3,2): next possible RIGHT to (4,2) then (5,2) apple.  \n- If I go RIGHT to (4,3): next possible DOWN to (4,2) then apple (5,2). Actually both are two moves from apple, but RIGHT seems more central and less limiting.  \n\nBut look at enemy: If enemy moves LEFT to (5,3) to get apple at (5,2)? No, apple is (5,2), not (5,3). So enemy would go DOWN from (6,3) to (6,2) then LEFT to (5,2) to get apple? That\u2019s two moves. So no immediate head-on risk.  \n\nI think RIGHT is good \u2014 it progresses toward apples (5,1) and (5,2), keeps options open, and avoids putting me too close to enemy this turn.  \n\nUP moves away from many apples.  \n\nPlan for next turns: Try to collect apple at (5,2) or (5,1), avoid getting trapped by enemy.  \n\nRIGHT",

Body: [(3,3), (2,3)].  \nEnemy #1 head at (5,3), body: [(6,3), (6,4)].  \n\nPossible moves from (4,3):  \n- UP (4,4): empty \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (4,2): empty \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT (3,3): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (5,3): enemy head \u2192 could cause head-to-head collision if enemy moves there OR if enemy stays put on collision? Wait \u2014 enemy is currently at (5,3)?? No \u2014 enemy head is currently at (5,3). So RIGHT would move into enemy head's current position. That means:  \n  - If enemy stays still (same cell next turn), both heads move into (5,3) \u2192 mutual collision \u2192 both die.  \n  - If enemy moves away from (5,3), then I move into (5,3) but enemy body still there? Enemy body is [(6,3), (6,4)] \u2014 no, (5,3) is enemy head now, not body. After enemy moves away, (5,3) is empty? Wait, no: enemy head leaves (5,3) and becomes its new head location; tail might follow, so (5,3) might become vacant or become part of enemy body? Actually enemy moves first: new head position = new cell, each segment shifts, so tail moves up \u2014 so (5,3) becomes empty initially unless it's still part of body due to apple growth.  \n\nActually enemy's body length is 3: head (5,3), then (6,3), then (6,4). So tail is at (6,4). If enemy moves, say, UP to (5,4), then body becomes [(5,4), (5,3), (6,3)] \u2014 so (5,3) becomes second segment, not empty. So if I move RIGHT into (5,3) and enemy moves any direction, (5,3) will be occupied by enemy body (since head leaves, body shifts), so I hit enemy body and die. Thus moving RIGHT is unsafe regardless of enemy move \u2014 since enemy can't disappear the (5,3) segment this turn.  \n\nYes \u2014 because enemy's current head is at (5,3), moving to any direction will leave (5,3) occupied by the second segment (old head). So I die if I go RIGHT. So **RIGHT is unsafe**.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN only. LEFT is my body. RIGHT is enemy head position (and becomes enemy body after their move).\n\n**Evaluation of UP vs DOWN:**  \nApples: (1,0), (0,2), (5,2), (5,8), (5,1).  \nFrom (4,3):  \n- UP (4,4): moves toward center and closer to apple (5,8) long-term, but far from others.  \n- DOWN (4,2): closer to apples at (5,2) and (5,1).  \n\nEnemy at (5,3) could interfere if I go toward (5,2): if enemy goes DOWN to (5,2), I'd be moving toward that apple next turn \u2014 possible confrontation. But safer to go DOWN because it's nearer apples. Also DOWN keeps more space \u2014 check surroundings after move:  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (4,2): possible next moves: LEFT (3,2), RIGHT (5,2), DOWN (4,1), UP back to (4,3) possibly blocked by body? Body will be [(3,3),(2,3)] still, so (4,3) is vacant. So 4 options likely. Good openness.  \n\nIf I go UP to (4,4): possible next moves: LEFT (3,4), RIGHT (5,4), UP (4,5), DOWN (4,3). Also 4 options. But further from apples.  \n\nSince enemy is length 3 like me, no advantage in avoiding confrontation yet, but shorter path to apples seems wiser.  \n\n**Plan:** Go DOWN toward apples at (5,2) or (5,1), proceed carefully to avoid enemy head-on next turn.\n\n**Future plan:** After DOWN, if enemy doesn't take (5,2), consider RIGHT to (5,2) if safe; else go LEFT/DOWN to (3,2) for safety and approach other apples.\n\nDOWN",

Current safe moves are LEFT to (4,0) or RIGHT to (6,0)\u2014UP and DOWN are invalid (into self or off-board). RIGHT might detour unnecessarily upward or rightward, potentially getting me closer to no apples while opening a path towards (9,4) or edges, but it congested near my body at (6,3). LEFT keeps multiple escapes (UP after eats, or RIGHT if enemy threatens left side) and directly positions me to eat (1,0) in ~2 more moves, then climb column 0 for (0,1) and (0,2). Enemy at (2,2)\u2014if they go DOWN to (2,1), I could eat (1,0) safely and grow before they reach; if LEFT to (1,2), dodge by UP early or stay low.

UP to (4,1)\u2014empty, good escape if enemy encroaches. DOWN to (4,-1)\u2014off board, die. So LEFT or UP. LEFT continues the quick path to eat (1,0), grow, and approach (0,1)/(0,2) in 2-3 more moves total. UP positions me at (4,1), out of row 0, avoiding potential enemy DOWN moves (if at (2,2) to (2,1)), and keeps options open to eat bottom apples via LEFT from there or trap enemy if they pursue. Enemy might go LEFT to (1,2), trailing (2,2)+body. Prioritize LEFT if enemy stays high; UP if they come DOWN low\u2014this turn, both are safe, but LEFT eats faster. From eat at (1,0), plan: LEFT to (2,0)? Wait, after eating at (1,0), new head (1,0), old body (4,0),(5,0),(5,1),...; then UP to (1,1) for (0,1) in 1-2, then (1,2)/(0,2). Monitor enemy\u2014 if they reach low like (2,1), I dodge RIGHT along row 0 to (3,0) then UP, or escape upward. If I get lead (5 apples soon), pivot toward (9,4) or far apples, but focus near cluster first for surge. Avoid BOTTOM if enemy blocks left; keep flexible.\n\nMoved LEFT as it directly advances apple eating without unnecessary detour, keeping escapes open. \n\nAfter moving LEFT to (3,0), continue planning: From (3,0), primary LEFT to (2,0) en route to (1,0), but check for adjacent moves\u2014UP to (3,1) if enemy threatens (like at 1,1 or 2,1), providing dodge to top or mid-board. Include RIGHT back to (4,0) only if revoking prior move due to new danger. If apple eaten next, grow and head UP toward (0,1) immediately after. Long-term: After bottom cluster (1,0,0,1,0,2), aim for distant (9,4) via row 1-3 rightward, or top (5,8) after space. If enemy dies or shrinks, go aggressive; else, skulk for safe wins.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

That could bring them to (0,2), potentially locking low apples unless I got there first. If enemy goes DOWN to (1,1), they could intercept later, so UP would dodge upward early. But LEFT eats faster without unnecessary detour, positionally improves to bottoms with UP escapers, and keeps RIGHT option if enemy forces a swing mid-board. Congestion near my (5,3) isn't relevant yet. Favor LEFT for safe apple advance over UP's safer-but-slower pivot.\n\n**START STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF**\nAfter LEFT to (3,0), move LEFT again to (2,0) to get within 1 LEFT of eating (1,0). Then eat (1,0), grow, and immediately UP to (1,1) to dodge low if enemy pursues (like if they went DOWN this turn to (1,1)), and to access (0,1) and (0,2) sequentially. Monitor enemy closely: if they ate (0,2) and grow to apples 3, stay aggressive on bottoms (eat (1,0), then swing LEFT then UP for (0,1) and (0,2)). If they die or stall, surge to mid (e.g., toward (9,4) after bottoms). Keep row 1+ as escape alleys to avoid bottom traps. If apples tie or need, head toward (5,8) over edges via right turns.\n\nLEFT\n**END STRATEGY NOTE TO FUTURE SELF** \n\nLEFT",

This opens the bottom for me without immediate threat; going LEFT to (2,0) sets up eating (1,0) next turn, growing my body to 5 segments, and evasion UP to (1,1) after eating to access remaining bottom apples like (0,1) if enemy hasn't eaten it or (0,2).

But they can only get to (2,0) or (3,1). No overlap with (0,1) this turn. So DOWN is collision-safe this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Tactical choice UP vs DOWN**  \n\nDOWN (0, 1): eat apple, grow, but might near enemy if they move to (2,0) \u2192 their next move could be to (1,0) or (2,1), potentially boxing me in next turn.  \n\nUP (0, 3): safe, moves away from enemy, but apple at (0,1) may be eaten by enemy soon.  \n\nIf I eat DOWN apple: next turn from (0,1):  \n- UP to (0, 2) (my body after growing) \u2192 blocked until tail moves.  \n- DOWN to (0,0) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT: off board unsafe.  \n- RIGHT to (1,1) \u2013 empty.  \n\nSo two possible moves next turn: DOWN or RIGHT.

More flexible.  \n\nGiven enemy has more apples and I need to survive, UP seems safer and maintains future flexibility.

This would shift me toward the left side of the board, potentially positioning for apples like (2,6), (0,6), or even (9,4) if pivoting, but it's farther and opens a broader area.\n- RIGHT to (9,6): Row 6 at x=9 is \".\", safe. Moves me to the edge at x=9, with less lateral freedom afterward (only LEFT, UP, DOWN). Apple at (9,4) is in this column but down near y=4, past my body, and might require backtracking.\n- DOWN to (8,5): This is directly into my body (first segment: (8,5)), so immediate death \u2013 invalid.\n\nAll safe moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN would kill me.\n\nEnemy snake (#0) is at head (2,7), far away at x=2, so no immediate threat to me at x=8. Their likely safe moves: LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7 \u2013 board row 7 at x=3 is \".\"), DOWN (2,6 \u2013 eats apple, board row 6 at x=2 is \"A\"). They can't go UP into their own body at (2,8).\n\nNo imminent head-on collision risk for me in any safe direction. Their closest potential move toward x=8 would be RIGHT repeatedly, but that's 5-7 turns away, and they might prioritize apples at (2,6) or elsewhere.\n\nPrioritize eating apples safely while keeping options open. UP keeps me in a spacious column (x=8, with y=7-9 likely open), allowing easy access to the apple at (8,8) next turn and future pivots. LEFT opens good maneuvering west but delays eating (next apple is (8,8) at the same y=8 level, reachable via UP in one turn vs. multiple LEFTs to zigzag). RIGHT limits space and feels more restrictive near the edge.\n\nUP is the best balance: direct path to eat (8,8) imminently, maintains a lead in apples (9 vs. 5), and aligns with the previous plan of going up in x=8.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating (8,8), continue up to avoid any body crowding \u2013 aim for (8,9) space, then turn LEFT toward accessible apples like (4,9) if enemy doesn't claim it first, or west toward (2,6)/(0,6) for more points. Monitor enemy \u2013 if they expand right/left aggressively, adjust to avoid trapping myself. Keep lead by eating before turn 50, while staying centralized to react.\n\nUP",

Wait, board shows apples: (9, 4), (0, 6), (6, 5), (4, 4), (2, 2) \u2014 so (4, 9) apple is gone. Enemy is now at (4, 9) with length 12.  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (3, 9), it\u2019s moving toward center. If enemy goes DOWN to (4, 8), it\u2019s also moving toward center.  \n\nI\u2019m on top row, enemy is at (4, 9). If I go RIGHT to (2, 9), enemy could go LEFT to (3, 9) \u2014 then we\u2019re adjacent horizontally. That\u2019s risky because if I go RIGHT again next turn to (3, 9), we could collide head-on if enemy stays there.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (1, 8), I\u2019m moving away from enemy, safer.\n\n**Step 5 \u2014 Future safe moves**  \n\nFrom (1, 8):  \n- UP (1, 9): my old body \u2192 unsafe next turn.  \n- DOWN (1, 7): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (0, 8): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (2, 8): empty \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo only RIGHT is safe next turn from (1, 8). That\u2019s a dead-end next turn.  \n\nFrom (2, 9):  \n- UP (2, 10): off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (2, 8): empty \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT (1, 9): my old body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (3, 9): possibly enemy\u2019s next position if it goes LEFT \u2192 but we don\u2019t know.  \n\nFrom (2, 9), next turn safe moves: DOWN (safe), possibly RIGHT if enemy not there.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2014 Risk assessment**  \n\nGoing DOWN to (1, 8) leaves me with only 1 safe move next turn (RIGHT), which is risky.  \nGoing RIGHT to (2, 9) leaves me with at least 1 safe move (DOWN), possibly 2 if (3, 9) is empty.  \n\nAlso, enemy is long (length 12), so I must avoid head-on collision. If enemy goes LEFT to (3, 9), then from (2, 9) I should not go RIGHT next turn. But I can go DOWN.  \n\nRIGHT seems better because it keeps more options than DOWN.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2014 Apples**  \n\nClosest apple is (2, 2) but far. (0, 6) is close but blocked by my body. Need to survive and plan route later.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (2, 9), go DOWN to (2, 8), then possibly (3, 8), etc., to avoid enemy and seek apples (4, 4) or (2, 2). Avoid top row since enemy is there.  \n\nRIGHT",

Check board \u2014 at y=8: \"T . . . 1 . . . T .\" \u2192 x=2 is empty ('T' for my tail? Wait legend: actually '0'=my head, 'T'=tail, '1'=enemy head, '.'=empty? Look: row 9 first has 'T T 0 .

Let\u2019s manually check.)  \n\nUpdate: checking empty squares logically:  \nMy body: (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (1,6). Enemy body: (4,9), (5,9), (6,9), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3).  \n\nFrom (2,9):\n- UP (2,10): off board \u2192 no.\n- DOWN (2,8): Check: (2,8) not in my body, not in enemy body \u2192 safe.\n- LEFT (1,9): my body segment x=1,y=9 \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT (3,9): Check: not in my body; not in enemy body (enemy body y=9 at x=4,5,6,7,8) \u2192 safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 3 \u2014 Enemy Snake #1 possible moves**  \n\nFrom (4,8):\n- UP (4,9): enemy body segment \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN (4,7): empty \u2192 safe.\n- LEFT (3,8): empty \u2192 safe.\n- RIGHT (5,8): empty \u2192 safe.\n\nSo enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**Step 4 \u2014 Risk of head-on collision**  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (3,8), and I go DOWN to (2,8) \u2192 not adjacent, safe.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (5,8), no conflict with my possible moves.  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (4,7), safe.  \n\nActually possible conflict: If enemy goes LEFT to (3,9)? Wait enemy at (4,8), y=8. To get to y=9, must be UP, but (4,9) is its body. So enemy cannot reach my positions except:  \nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), enemy can\u2019t get there in 1 move.  \n\nThe only dangerous head-on is if we choose same cell next turn. But now, after I move this turn, enemy\u2019s head and mine won\u2019t occupy same cell unless I go to (3,9) and enemy goes to (3,9) from (3,8) \u2014 but enemy will be at (4,8) this turn. For head-on next turn: En: (3,8) \u2192 (3,9). Me: (3,9) \u2192 need to be at (2,9) now? Actually head-on collision happens if two heads move to same cell *this turn*: not possible since I\u2019m at (2,9) now, enemy at (4,8), no overlap possible in one move.  \n\nSo no immediate head-on risk this turn (they\u2019re too far apart); but be careful next turn.\n\n**Step 5 \u2014 Future safe moves**  \n\nFrom (2,8):\n- UP (2,9): my body next turn? Wait after I move, my body will include (2,9)? Actually new body after move:  \nIf I go DOWN to (2,8): head=(2,8), body=[(2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (1,7)] \u2014 tail (1,6) gone. Then next turn from (2,8):\nUP (2,9) will be my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (2,7): likely empty? Check: my body at (1,7), enemy body at (8,7), so empty.  \nLEFT (1,8): empty.  \nRIGHT (3,8): possible enemy this turn? Unknown.  \n\nSo from (2,8) next turn: safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, (maybe RIGHT if enemy not there).  \n\nFrom (3,9):\n- UP (3,10): off board.\n- DOWN (3,8): empty? safe unless enemy goes there this turn.  \n   If enemy goes (3,8) this turn, I must avoid (3,8) next turn. But I can check next turn.\n- LEFT (2,9): my body \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT (4,9): enemy body \u2192 unsafe.\n\nSo from (3,9) next turn only safe is DOWN, maybe.\n\nThus (2,8) offers more options next turn.\n\n**Step 6 \u2014 Apples**  \n\nApple (2,2) is far down. (4,4) is closer but need to move right/down.  \nGoing DOWN now gets me toward those apples.  \nEnemy is at (4,8) possibly moving toward (4,7) toward apple (4,4), so I should compete. But I am shorter; need to avoid confrontations.\n\n**Step 7 \u2014 Decision**  \n\nDOWN is safer:  \n- More future options next turn.  \n- Moves me toward apples.  \n- Avoids staying near enemy\u2019s territory (top-right area).  \n\nRIGHT gets me to (3,9) with fewer next-move options.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nAfter DOWN to (2,8), proceed down/left toward apple (2,2), then (4,4), avoiding enemy path. Keep tail in mind for possible looping.\n\nDOWN",

UP to (4,8) invalid (into own body). No off-board or enemy head risks on these moves. Enemy head at (2,8) is distant and left-leaning; unlikely to collide if I stick central-south. Apples at (4,4) [3 moves south, open path in column 4], (6,5) [nearer via RIGHT then east/down], but others farther. I lead 11-6; prioritize growing safely.\n\n**DECISION RATIONALE**  \nAmong safe moves, prioritize DOWN: Direct continuation of plan toward guaranteed apple at (4,4) in empty column 4 (via 4,6 and 4,5 to 4,4 on next turn, then north for growth). Keeps multiple options after eating (east to 6,5, north for positioning). LEFT weakens centrality, risks left-edge confinement near enemy activity. RIGHT shifts east prematurely but could pivot to (6,5) via row 7 moves; however, better to secure closer apple first per plan to maintain lead and flank options. No traps or dead-ends apparent; avoids enemy head-on paths.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE**  \nSecure (4,4) efficiently (two more DOWN moves: to 4,6 then 4,5, eat at 4,4). After eating and growing, turn RIGHT (east) via (5,5) or similar toward (6,5) in row 5, scouting north or west post-growth for blocking/expansion. Monitor enemy (likely southward/left) for clashes; abort plan if they pivot center.\n\nDOWN",

But if I go RIGHT to (3, 8), enemy can go LEFT to (3, 7), no overlap. However, if I go DOWN to (2, 7) and enemy goes DOWN to (4, 6), still fine. No immediate deadly overlap. Riskiest would be if enemy next turn moves to a cell I also target next turn \u2014 but can check then.\n\n**Step 3 \u2014 Future mobility & apple access**  \nFrom each safe move:\n- **DOWN (2, 7):** Next turn: UP blocked (body), RIGHT (3,7) might see enemy? Possibly blocked if enemy goes (3,7) this turn from (4,7). Options remain: DOWN (2,6), LEFT (1,7) my body \u2014 opps, (1,7) is my body (tail) \u2192 so after move DOWN, body = [(2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7)], tail (1,7) gone. So (1,7) empty next turn. So options: UP (2,8) body, DOWN (2,6), LEFT (1,7) empty, RIGHT (3,7) possibly enemy. So 2\u20133 moves possible.\n- **LEFT (1, 8):** Next turn: UP (1,9) my body, DOWN (1,7) my current tail gone after this move? Wait: If I go LEFT to (1,8), new body: head=(1,8). body=[(2,8), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7)], tail (1,7) gone.  \nSo next turn: UP (1,9) body, DOWN (1,7) empty, LEFT (0,8) body, RIGHT (2,8) body. So only DOWN safe. Trapped? Yes, only one escape next turn.  \n- **RIGHT (3, 8):** Next turn: UP (3,9) enemy body, DOWN (3,7) possible enemy this turn, LEFT (2,8) my body, RIGHT (4,8) enemy body. If enemy not at (3,7) next turn, only DOWN possible; if enemy at (3,7), I die next turn. Very risky.\n\nThus DOWN gives more options next turn.\n\n**Step 4 \u2014 Apple targeting**  \nClosest apples: (2,2) far; (4,4) more relevant.  \nGoing DOWN (2,7) lets me go further DOWN towards (2,2) or curve RIGHT later to (4,4). Safer path away from enemy, who is near (4,7) top area.\n\n**Step 5 \u2014 Decision**  \n- DOWN: safer future moves, path to apple.  \n- LEFT: next turn trapped.  \n- RIGHT: risky next turn.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**\nAfter going DOWN to (2,7), check enemy position; likely move DOWN again to (2,6) to approach apple (2,2), avoiding enemy\u2019s likely movement toward (4,4).\n\nDOWN",

Wait \u2014 no, my body has (0,7) as tail, not (1,7). So (1,7) is empty).  \n- **RIGHT (3, 7)**: empty.\n\nAll except UP safe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2 \u2014 Enemy risk**  \nEnemy head at (4, 6).  \nEnemy possible moves: UP (4, 7) its body, DOWN (4, 5) empty, LEFT (3, 6) empty, RIGHT (5, 6) empty.  \nSo they can be at (4, 5), (3, 6), (5, 6) next turn.\n\nHead-on collision this turn:  \nIf I go RIGHT (3, 7), they could go (3, 6) or (5, 6) \u2014 no shared target cell \u2192 safe.  \nIf I go LEFT (1, 7), no conflict.  \nIf I go DOWN (2, 6), enemy could go (3, 6) \u2014 adjacent but not same cell \u2192 okay.  \n\nNext turn head-on risk:  \nIf I go DOWN (2, 6), next turn my possible moves: UP (2, 7) my body, DOWN (2, 5) empty, LEFT (1, 6) empty, RIGHT (3, 6) possibly enemy if they go there this turn. So we could collide next turn if both choose (3,6) then \u2014 but I can avoid by not going RIGHT next turn if enemy is near.\n\n**Step 3 \u2014 Future mobility**  \n- **DOWN (2, 6)**: Opens toward apple (2, 2). Next turn options: DOWN (2,5), LEFT (1,6), RIGHT (3,6) risk.  \n- **LEFT (1, 7)**: Less future mobility \u2014 next turn: UP (1,8) body, DOWN (1,6) empty, LEFT (0,7) body, RIGHT (2,7) body \u2192 only DOWN possible. Trapped.  \n- **RIGHT (3, 7)**: Next turn: UP (3,8) my body? Not my body but wait: My body = [(2,8), (2,9), ...] \u2192 (3,8) empty. Down (3,6) possible enemy this turn, Left (2,7) body, Right (4,7) enemy body OR maybe empty? Enemy head left (4,6), body has (4,7)? Enemy body: starts head (4,6), then (4,7), yes (4,7) is enemy body \u2014 so right unsafe. So next turn at (3,7), moves: UP (3,8) free, DOWN (3,6) risky enemy proximity possibly, but LEFT blocked, RIGHT blocked. Basically limited to UP/DOWN but one risky. Worse than DOWN\u2019s options.\n\n**Step 4 \u2014 Apple targeting**  \nApple at (2,2) is straight DOWN path but far. Apple at (4,4) is reachable maybe via RIGHT then DOWN after. But enemy is near (4,6), so going toward (4,4) risks encounter.  \nSafer to go DOWN toward (2,2), staying opposite side of board from enemy\u2019s current position.\n\n**Step 5 \u2014 Conclusion**  \nLEFT leads to trap. RIGHT leads to limited options near enemy. DOWN gives better flexibility and path to apple.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2,6), likely enemy at (3,6) or (4,5) or (5,6). Avoid RIGHT next turn if enemy near. Move toward apple (2,2) or maybe swing left to (0,6) apple if possible afterward.\n\n**Final move:**  \nDOWN",

LEFT (3,5) to empty cell (row 5, col 3 is '.' per board state). RIGHT (5,5) to empty cell (between current position and apple at 6,5). No out-of-bounds or own-body risks in other three; enemy bodies not in any target cell. Enemy head at (2,6): UP (2,7) blocked by own body (directly to neck/body); safe options likely LEFT (1,6)-empty, RIGHT (3,6)-empty, DOWN (2,5)-empty. Enemy could move toward west/central (RIGHT) or southwest/down, potentially encroaching if they go right toward (3,6). Closest apple (4,4) is immediate DOWN, with column 4 wide open to row 0. Other apples: (6,5) two rights then downIf eat (4,4) and grow, keep solid 11-6 lead and central control. Row 4 has open space east/west, column space north/south post-eat.\n\n**DECISION RATIONALE**  \nPrioritize DOWN to (4,4) for immediate apple eat, growing +1 to score (lead now 12-6), keeping me in unblocked column 4. This aligns with last plan to secure (4,4) via vertical path, maximizes apple progress efficiently while distancing from enemy (now at opposite board side). Keeps multiple future options: from (4,4) post-eat, RIGHT (5,4) or UP (5,5 restored after tail move?) for scouting east toward (6,5) at row 5 or south freedoms. LEFT (3,4) moves west, bringing me toward enemy if they pivot left/down (increasing collision/head-on risk in central-west, e.g., if to (3,5)&enemy to (3,6) next). RIGHT (5,5) heads east prematurely, skipping closer apple but reaching midline; misses opportunity now, reduces vertical momentum. DOWN offers safest eat with high optionality (right/up as exits), no head-ons likely (enemy paths diverge), and maintains open board access.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE**  \nNext: Eat (4,4) \u2192 head at (4,4), grow. From there, go RIGHT to (5,4) to row 4 east, scouting toward (6,5) via level path (DOWN/LEFT later if needed). Avoid LEFT to (3,4) unless enemy remain distant; prioritize east/southeast for continued central [notice (9,4) but assist? ] apple aggregation, fallback north/up if space congeals. Monitor enemy (likely west pivot); if they chase central, shift east harder. Aim for (6,5) next for quick 13+ lead.\n\nDOWN",

Wait \u2014 snake movement without growth: head moves forward, all segments shift, tail cell vacated. Body length stays same.

Enemy head at (1,6): Likely LEFT to (0,6) for easy apple eat, moving west/farther away; possible RIGHT to central or DOWN south, but paths may converge less. Closest apples: (6,5) at (6,5) viable via east path; (9,4) east also. (8,5) midline; others farther. Lead 12-6 maintained; eastern path maximizes apple access without constriction, distancing from enemy.\n\n**DECISION RATIONALE**  \nRIGHT to (5,4) safest and plan-aligned: Eliminates UP suicide gamble. RIGHT keeps multiple exits (RIGHT to (6,4) for closer east apple scouting, UP to (5,5) or DOWN to (5,3) for flexibility), avoids LEFT (potential enemy proximity, e.g., if pivoting right/down, head-on risks in column 3-4). DOWN traps riskier vertically (dead-end southward to y=0 with no apples/escapes). RIGHT directly follows prior strategy to secure (6,5) via row-4 path, no head-on threats (enemy diverging west), preserves open board east (rows 4-5 clear for apple aggregation).\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE**  \nNext: RIGHT to (5,4) \u2192 continue RIGHT to (6,4) next turn for proximity to (6,5). Post-eat, shift UP to (6,5) from (6,4) if safe. Then pursue (8,5) or (9,4) east/up for 13+ lead. Monitor enemy: If still west (e.g., at (0,6)), push east aggressively; if central pivot, circle north via (5,5)+(6,5) path. Avoid west/left unless enemy clears; prioritize row-4/5 line for sustained options/openness.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy head at (0,6) with safe moves UP (0,7) or DOWN (0,5); likely UP towards (0,8) apple or DOWN exploring south, either way diverging from east.

Row5 open for chaining eats; row4 path slower for (6,5). No head-on risks; maintains lead (12-7).\n\n### DECISION RATIONALE\nUP to (5,5) preferred over RIGHT for immediate row5 entry: faster progression towards clustered eastern apples ((6,5) eatable in 1 turn via subsequent RIGHT), multiple follow-up exits (U to (5,6) north explore, R to (6,5) apple, D back if needed, L self-avoid), avoids potential row4 stagnation (RIGHT then UP takes 2 turns for (6,5)). DOWN risks south confinement with distant/src (2,2); maintains eastward momentum, distances from western enemy. No trap: row5 clear rightward cukup to col9 (apple at (9,5) hypothetical, but current (8,5) at (8,5)).\n\n### STRATEGY NOTE\nContinue chasing row5 apples: UP to (5,5) \u2192 next RIGHT to (6,5) eat ((8,5) next at dist 2 from there), sustaining east momentum for (9,4) access.

So tail stays at (2,8).\n\nFrom (0,8) next turn options:  \n- UP (0,9): empty & safe (no body, no enemy)  \n- DOWN (0,7): my body segment (neck is at (1,8), but (0,7) is body segment, yes dangerous)  \n- LEFT off board \u2192 death  \n- RIGHT (1,8): my neck/body segment \u2192 death  \n\nSo after (0,8) only safe is UP to (0,9) next turn.\n\n**Step 4 \u2014 Long-term planning**  \nFrom (0,9): possible moves next: DOWN(0,8) is new body segment? Need to check body configuration at that time, but likely very restricted. Still, must survive now.  \n\nPotential trap: going (0,8) this turn, then only UP to (0,9) next turn, then maybe trapped at top-left corner. But better than dying now.  \n\nApple at (0,8) is closest; eating helps close score gap (7 \u2192 8 vs enemy 13).\n\n**Step 5 \u2014 Final decision**  \nOnly legal move: LEFT to (0,8).  \n\n**Strategy note for my future self after eating apple at (0,8):**  \nYou\u2019ll be at (0,8), body blocks DOWN and RIGHT (neck and segment), LEFT off board, only UP safe to (0,9). From (0,9) next turn check: body shifts; possible safe moves then might be RIGHT (1,9)? Keep hugging top-left wall until an escape route opens. Avoid corners; plan route toward center/other apples after escaping.  \n\nLEFT",

This positions me better for future moves southward (e.g., toward (5,1) at (5,1)), keeps options open, and avoids potential crowding near my body mass to the east/north (where many body segments are at x=4-9 in rows 4-9). UP to (9,5) would let me eat (8,6) in a two-step path but risks tighter spaces near body segments at x=4-8 in row 5 after shifting, limiting follow-ups. Enemy snake is distant NW and unlikely to cause issues, but DOWN maintains broader safety and apple access.\n\nLong-term: After eating (6,3), prioritize going west/left along row 3, then south to target (5,1) and south row 2's (2,2). Avoid north/northeast to stay clear of my own body clusters and the enemy. Build up to 20+ apples by turn ~60-70, monitoring enemy to ensure no head-on threats.\n\nDOWN",

Neither move puts its head near me this turn, but RIGHT could position it closer for future turns, slightly increasing potential head-on risks if I linger near east side.\n\nLEFT to (8,3) immediately closes distance to the nearest apple at (6,3) in row 3 (reachable in two more LEFT moves: (8,3)\u2014(7,3)\u2014(6,3)). From there, after eating it, I'd have open options: further LEFT toward (2,3) in row 3, UP to (6,4) into mostly open space, or DOWN to (6,2) toward southern apples like (5,1) and (2,2). This keeps three directions available post-eat, avoids tightening space near my right-side body mass, and aligns with morphing last turn's south-facing plan into west-south priority.\n\nDOWN to (9,2) keeps me in column 9 with open options (UP back, DOWN to (9,1), LEFT to (8,2)), but reaching (6,3) would require more steps (e.g., UP then LEFT three times) and delays progress toward row 3 apples or south ones. Enemy's possible RIGHT move gives it more eastward freedom, potentially boxing me in if I stay right-bound. LEFT minimizes wasted moves while progressing toward max-apple win (currently 15 vs. 9, aiming for separation by 50).\n\nLong-term: Eat (6,3) next turn by continuing LEFT from (8,3). Then choose LEFT or DOWN based on enemy position\u2014LEFT to row 3 apples if enemy stays north/west, DOWN if enemy descends menacingly. Target (2,3) early turns, loop south to (2,2) and (5,1), monitor enemy for head-ons, and push to 50 by ~70-80 turns if no deaths.\n\nLEFT",

Let\u2019s verify: Body list: index0: (2,7) new head, index1: (2,9) old head, index2: (1,9), etc. So (2,8) not in body \u2014 correct. UP (2,8) is safe. LEFT (1,7) is in body (1,7) is index6.

Wait, board shows at y=5:  \n  Row 5: T A T . T T T T T .  \n  So (1, 5) is 'A'? Actually apples list says (1, 5) is an apple, but board at (1, 5) shows 'T'? That\u2019s a conflict \u2014 maybe board is before apple spawn? Let\u2019s trust the apples list: (1, 5) is an apple.  \n\nFrom (0, 7):  \n- UP: no apple.  \n- RIGHT: (1, 7) \u2192 no apple.  \n\nBut after moving:  \nIf UP to (0, 8), then next turn I can go RIGHT to (1, 8), then DOWN to (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5) apple.  \nIf RIGHT to (1, 7), then next turn I can go DOWN to (1, 6), then (1, 5) apple \u2014 that\u2019s shorter: RIGHT now \u2192 DOWN next turn \u2192 apple in 2 moves.  \n\nActually RIGHT now gets me closer to apple (1, 5) faster than UP.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Enemy snake #1**  \nEnemy head at (0, 2).

No immediate collision threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Long-term space**  \nMy tail ends at (2, 8) after this move (since we ate an apple last turn? Wait, last turn we moved UP to (0, 7) and ate apple at (0, 7) \u2014 yes, so body length increased by 1, tail stayed at (2, 9) originally but now after this move tail will be at (2, 8)).  \n\nRight now body blocks much of right side from x=2 upward. Moving RIGHT keeps me nearer the left edge but gives more lateral movement options next turn (UP/DOWN free). Moving UP goes along left edge, reducing lateral freedom next turn (only UP/RIGHT).  \n\nRIGHT seems to open more space.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Final choice**  \nRIGHT gets me closer to apple (1, 5) and keeps more flexibility.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (1, 7), consider going DOWN toward apple (1, 5) if safe, else UP to avoid dead ends.  \n\nRIGHT",

That\u2019s risky if enemy snake #1 moves there simultaneously (head-on collision possible).  \n\nApple (1, 3) is below but enemy snake #1 is near there \u2014 risky.  \nApple (4, 2) is also near enemy\u2019s territory.  \n\nFrom UP at (1, 8), I can go LEFT to (0, 8), then DOWN to (0, 7), (0, 6), etc., eventually reaching (1, 5) from the left side safely.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Enemy snake #1**  \nEnemy head at (0, 3).

Still, going DOWN now funnels me into potential conflict.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Long-term space**  \nMy tail is at (2, 8). Moving UP opens more space along the top-left area. Moving DOWN risks getting near the enemy and limits options.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Final choice**  \nUP gives more safe options next turn and avoids immediate danger.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (1, 8), go LEFT to (0, 8) to keep distance from enemy and circle toward apples safely.  \n\nUP",
