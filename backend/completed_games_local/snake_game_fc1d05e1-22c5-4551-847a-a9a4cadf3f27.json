It is a safe move.\n    *   **DOWN (7, 4):** This cell also contains an apple and is safe.\n    *   **UP (7, 6):** Safe, but moves away from immediate apples.\n    *   **LEFT (6, 5):** This is my own body (tail). Moving here would result in death.\n\n2.  **Strategy:**\n    *   My goal is to collect the local apples efficiently while positioning myself for the cluster of apples in the bottom-right corner (around (9, 3), (8, 2), (7, 0), etc.).\n    *   **Option A (RIGHT first):** Move RIGHT to (8, 5) [eat], then DOWN to (8, 4), then LEFT to (7, 4) [eat]. This path (consuming 2 apples in 3 moves) ends with my head at (7, 4), facing left/down. This orientation is excellent for continuing towards (8, 2) and (9, 3) in the subsequent turns without backtracking.\n    *   **Option B (DOWN first):** Move DOWN to (7, 4) [eat], then RIGHT to (8, 4), then UP to (8, 5) [eat]. This path ends with my head at (8, 5), facing up/right. From here, navigating to the bottom-right corner is more awkward, potentially forcing me against the right wall or requiring disjointed movement.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    Starting with the move **RIGHT** sets up a smoother collection path (sweeping right, then down, then left) that naturally funnels the snake into the apple-rich bottom section of the board. The opponent snake is far away at (3, 2) and poses no immediate threat to this plan.\n\n**Long-term Strategy:**\nMove RIGHT to (8, 5) to collect the apple. Next turn, move DOWN to (8, 4), then turn LEFT to (7, 4) to collect the second apple. From (7, 4), proceed downwards to target the cluster of apples at (9, 3), (8, 2), and the bottom row. This sequence maximizes intake while maintaining a safe distance from walls and the opponent.\n\nRIGHT",

It is on the opposite side of the board and poses no threat.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Moving RIGHT is the efficient choice. It strictly adheres to the edge-sweeping strategy, secures an apple immediately, and maintains the best orientation for future turns.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nMove RIGHT to (9, 3) to eat the apple. On the following turn, move DOWN to (9, 2), and then turn LEFT to (8, 2) to consume the second apple. This \"hook\" maneuver efficiently clears the corner area before advancing towards the bottom row targets (9, 0) and (7, 0).\n\nRIGHT",

Valid moves are DOWN (9, 1) and LEFT (8, 2).\n2.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    *   **LEFT (8, 2):** This move immediately captures an apple. Although it requires a slight deviation from a straight path down, it sets up a highly efficient sequence to clear the entire bottom-right corner. The sequence is:\n        *   Turn 10: LEFT to (8, 2) (Eat Apple).\n        *   Turn 11: DOWN to (8, 1).\n        *   Turn 12: RIGHT to (9, 1).\n        *   Turn 13: DOWN to (9, 0) (Eat Apple).\n        *   Turn 14: LEFT to (8, 0).\n        *   Then proceed LEFT along the bottom row (7, 0), (6, 0).\n        This path (\"The 2x2 Loop\") captures 2 apples in 4 moves (plus the subsequent ones) and ensures no apples are left behind in the corner (specifically 8,2 and 9,0), which would be hard to reach later. The body configuration during this loop (a small block) unwinds naturally as I exit towards (7, 0).\n    *   **DOWN (9, 1):** This move is safe and moves towards the corner apple (9, 0). However, it bypasses the apple at (8, 2). To get (8, 2) later would require significant backtracking or a disjointed path. It is more point-efficient to collect reachable apples in the current sector before moving on.\n3.  **Safety Check:**\n    *   Moving LEFT to (8, 2) is safe; the cell is empty (contains apple).\n    *   The subsequent planned moves (8,1 -> 9,1 -> 9,0) form a valid path with no dead ends, provided I commit to the loop. The only escape from (9, 0) is (8, 0), which leads safely to the open board on the left.\n    *   Snake 1 is at (0, 2), far away on the left side of the board, and cannot interfere with this corner operation in the next 5-10 turns.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Moving LEFT accounts for immediate gain and optimal long-term board clearing.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nMove LEFT to (8, 2) to eat the apple. Then move DOWN to (8, 1), RIGHT to (9, 1), and DOWN to (9, 0) to collect the corner apple. From there, traverse LEFT along the bottom row (row 0) to collect the line of apples there.\n\nLEFT",

This tunnel-like path is safe as it leads into open space populated with apples, and my tail will uncoil from the corner as I advance.

The enemy snake (ID 1) is far away at the top-left (0, 9).\n2.  **Move Evaluation:**\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 0):** Immediate death (collision with own body).\n    *   **DOWN (6, -1):** Immediate death (wall).\n    *   **UP (6, 1):** Moves into open space with 3 exits. Positions for the apple at (5, 1). Leaving (5, 0) empty might create a 1-tile gap (\"hole\") later if I circle back to the left, as (5, 0) would be surrounded by body segments and the wall.\n    *   **LEFT (5, 0):** Moves along the bottom wall. Positions for the apple at (5, 1) (by moving UP next) or (3, 0) (by moving LEFT). Although this position has only 2 exits (UP and LEFT), both lead to open/safe areas. Crucially, filling (5, 0) now prevents it from becoming an unusable hole, allowing for a tighter, more space-efficient path through the cluster of apples at (5, 1), (4, 1), and (3, 0).\n3.  **Strategy:** My goal is to collect the cluster of apples in the bottom-center region efficienty.\n    *   If I move **UP** to (6, 1), then Left to (5, 1), Left to (4, 1), then try to get (3, 0), the cell at (5, 0) becomes trapped between my body and the wall.\n    *   If I move **LEFT** to (5, 0), I can then move UP to (5, 1). This consumes the exact same apple on the 2nd turn but leaves my body occupying (5, 0) instead of (6, 1). (6, 1) is a more valuable interior space to keep open for maneuvering than (5, 0).\n    *   Therefore, the path `LEFT -> UP` is topologically superior to `UP -> LEFT`.\n4.  **Plan:** Move LEFT to (5, 0). Next turn, move UP to (5, 1) to eat the apple. Then move LEFT to (4, 1) (apple), then DOWN to (4, 0) and LEFT to (3, 0) (apple). This zig-zag path consumes 3 apples swiftly and packs the body efficiently against the bottom wall.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nExecute move LEFT to (5, 0). On the next turn, move UP to (5, 1) to eat the apple. Subsequent moves should target (4, 1) and then loop down to (4, 0) and (3, 0) to maximize space efficiency while collecting the cluster.\n\nLEFT",

Immediate death.\n    *   **UP (5, 2):** Safe and empty. Leads towards apples at (5, 3) and others higher up.\n    *   **RIGHT (6, 1):** Empty, but leads away from the cluster of apples to the left and into open space next to my tail.\n    *   **LEFT (4, 1):** Safe and contains an **Apple**. This move is optimal because it rewards immediate points and positions the head for further captures.\n3.  **Strategic Plan:** The previous turn's plan was to move UP to (5, 1) to set up a move LEFT to (4, 1). I am sticking to this plan. Moving LEFT secures the apple at (4, 1).\n4.  **Forward Path:**\n    *   From (4, 1), the cell below at (4, 0) is empty.\n    *   The cell to the left of that, (3, 0), contains another apple.\n    *   Therefore, the sequence `LEFT (eat) -> DOWN (maneuver) -> LEFT (eat)` efficiently clears the apples in the bottom-middle area, filling the 2x2 block at (4,0)-(5,1) without leaving gaps.\n    *   After clearing the bottom, the path naturally opens upwards via (3, 1) to the apple at (3, 2) and the rich cluster around row 3.\n    *   The enemy snake is distant (at the top of the board), posing no immediate threat to this sequence.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nMove LEFT to (4, 1) to collect the apple. Then move DOWN to (4, 0) and LEFT to (3, 0) to collect the next apple. This fills the local space efficiently. Afterward, move UP through (3, 1) towards the apple at (3, 2).\n\nLEFT",

My tail at (8, 2) will therefore remain effectively stationary for this turn as the new segment is added. My body occupies the bottom-right block of the board (rows 0 and 1, columns 3-9).\n2.  **Immediate Surroundings:**\n    *   **UP (3, 3):** Open. Leads to open space.\n    *   **DOWN (3, 1):** Blocked by my own body.\n    *   **LEFT (2, 2):** Open, but leads away from the main cluster of apples.\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 2):** Open. It is adjacent to my body segment at (4, 1). Occupying this square keeps my snake compact against its own body (\"hugging the wall\"), preventing the creation of hard-to-reach gaps.\n3.  **Strategy:**\n    *   There is a sequence of three aligned apples at Y=3: (4, 3), (5, 3), and (6, 3).\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** to (4, 2) positions me to move **UP** to (4, 3) next turn. This sequence ((3,2)->(4,2)->(4,3)->(5,3)->(6,3)) allows me to collect three apples in quick succession while filling the space efficiently at Y=2.\n    *   Moving UP immediately to (3,3) would also work but leaves (4,2) as an empty gap between my path and my existing body, which is poor space management.\n    *   **Enemy Analysis:** Snake 1 is at (7, 9), far away in the top right. Its path to these apples is longer, and it will likely prioritize apples closer to it (e.g., (6, 8)). I have safe, uncontested access to the Y=3 row.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (4, 2). Then move UP to (4, 3) to eat the first apple in the row. Continue RIGHT to consume (5, 3) and (6, 3).\n\nRIGHT",
