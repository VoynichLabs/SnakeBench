UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.  \n\n**Apples nearby:**  \nClosest apples: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 7), (3, 1), etc.  \n\nFrom (0, 6):  \n- UP (0, 7): no apple there.  \n- DOWN (0, 5): no apple there.  \n- RIGHT (1, 6): no apple there.  \n\nSo no immediate apple in one move.  \n\n**Enemy snake #0 at (2, 4):**  \nPossible moves for it: UP (2, 5), DOWN (2, 3) (apple at (2, 3)), LEFT (1, 4), RIGHT (3, 4).  \nIt might go for (2, 3) apple, or move randomly.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 6), I\u2019m far from enemy head, safe.  \n\n**Future options:**  \nFrom (0, 6):  \n- UP (0, 7): then can go UP again to (0, 8) (apple at (0, 8)? no, board shows no apple at (0, 8) \u2014 actually board shows row 8: . . . . A . . . A A, so x=0 row 8 is empty). Actually row 8: x=0 col 8? Wait, coordinates: (8,8) is apple, (0,8) is empty. So UP twice gives no apple but more space.  \n- DOWN (0, 5): then maybe toward (0, 1) apple eventually.  \n- RIGHT (1, 6): puts me closer to center, more apples accessible in future.  \n\nI think going RIGHT opens more options because I\u2019m currently on left edge with only 3 moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Staying on edge reduces future moves if I grow. Moving inward gives more mobility.  \n\n**Potential danger:** Enemy at (2, 4) could move to (1, 4) or (2, 5) etc., but I\u2019m at (1, 6) after RIGHT, so not adjacent to enemy\u2019s possible moves. No risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nMove toward center to have more escape routes, then target nearest apple (maybe (2, 7) or (1, 2) depending on position). Avoid moving toward enemy until necessary.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT  \n\nRIGHT",

That means enemy\u2019s possible safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nNone of those are my possible next head positions (2,7), (2,5), (1,6), (3,6) except possibly if enemy moves UP to (3,4) \u2014 not my squares. So no risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\nAlso, enemy body at (2,3) and (2,4) won\u2019t be in my target squares.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Consider eating apple at (2,7):**  \nIf I go UP to (2,7), I eat apple, grow to length 2 next turn (head at (2,7), tail at (2,6)). That\u2019s good for scoring.  \n\nFrom (2,7) after eating, next turn my body will be at (2,6). Possible moves from (2,7):  \n- UP (2,8) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN (2,6) \u2013 my own body next turn (so invalid then).  \n- LEFT (1,7) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT (3,7) \u2013 empty.  \n\nSo 3 safe moves next turn if I eat apple now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Consider other moves:**  \nIf I go DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT, I don\u2019t eat apple now, but maybe get closer to other apples later. However, apple at (2,7) is one step away, very close.  \n\nEnemy is far away at (3,3), not threatening (2,7) this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nEat apple at (2,7) now, then next turn avoid moving DOWN into own new body. From (2,7), go UP/LEFT/RIGHT depending on safety and nearest apples (maybe (4,8) or (3,1) later). Keep distance from enemy who is growing.  \n\n---\n\n**Final decision:**  \nUP to (2,7) to eat apple.  \n\nUP",

Wait, after moving UP, my body will be [(2,8), (2,7)], tail at (2,6)? No:  \nIf I move UP now: head to (2,8), body becomes [(2,8), (2,7)], tail stays at (2,6) because I didn\u2019t eat apple. Actually, I need to check: I have 1 apple collected, length 2. If I move without eating apple, my tail moves forward? In Snake, when you don\u2019t eat apple, you move head forward, tail follows (so length stays same). So after moving UP without eating apple:  \nHead (2,8), body segments: old head (2,7) becomes body[1], old tail (2,6) disappears. So body = [(2,8), (2,7)]. Yes.  \n\nSo from (2,8) next turn, DOWN to (2,7) is my own body \u2192 invalid. So from (2,8) safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nFrom (1,7): body becomes [(1,7), (2,7)], tail gone. Next turn from (1,7): DOWN (1,6) empty, LEFT (0,7) empty, RIGHT (2,7) my body \u2192 invalid, UP (1,8) empty. So 3 safe moves.  \n\nFrom (3,7): body becomes [(3,7), (2,7)], tail gone. Next turn from (3,7): DOWN (3,6) empty, LEFT (2,7) my body \u2192 invalid, RIGHT (4,7) empty, UP (3,8) empty. So 3 safe moves.  \n\nAll three options give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is at (3,2) with length 3, likely to eat apple at (3,1) if they go DOWN. That will grow them to length 4, moving their tail forward. They\u2019ll be closer to my area soon. I should collect apples quickly but avoid being near their head when they\u2019re longer.  \n\nRIGHT to (3,7) puts me near apples (5,7) and (6,7), but also closer to center. UP to (2,8) is slightly safer from enemy currently. LEFT to (1,7) moves me toward left side apples but fewer apples there.  \n\nI think RIGHT is best for immediate apple gathering.  \n\n---\n\n**Final decision:**  \nRIGHT to (3,7).  \n\nRIGHT",

No enemy body in these squares currently.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Immediate danger from enemy head:**  \nEnemy head at (3, 1).  \nEnemy\u2019s possible moves from (3, 1):  \n- UP \u2192 (3, 2) \u2013 its own body \u2192 invalid for them.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 0) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 1) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 1) \u2013 empty.  \n\nSo enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.  \nMy possible next heads: (3,8), (3,6), (4,7).  \nEnemy\u2019s possible next heads: (3,0), (2,1), (4,1).  \nNo overlap \u2192 no risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\nAlso, enemy body at (3,2), (3,3), (2,3) not in my target squares.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Consider apples:**  \nClosest apples to my possible moves:  \n- UP (3,8): closest apple is (4,8) distance 1, also (5,9) distance ~2.2.  \n- DOWN (3,6): closest apple is (1,2) distance 5, (0,5) distance ~3.6, (5,0) far.  \n- RIGHT (4,7): closest apple is (5,7) distance 1, (6,7) distance 2, (7,7) distance 3.  \n\nUP gets me very close to (4,8) (one move away next turn).  \nRIGHT gets me close to (5,7) (one move away next turn).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each move:**  \n\nFrom (3,8): body becomes [(3,8), (3,7)], tail gone. Next turn from (3,8): DOWN (3,7) my body \u2192 invalid, LEFT (2,8) empty, RIGHT (4,8) empty (apple there), UP (3,9) empty. So 3 safe moves.  \n\nFrom (3,6): body becomes [(3,6), (3,7)], tail gone. Next turn from (3,6): UP (3,7) my body \u2192 invalid, DOWN (3,5) empty, LEFT (2,6) empty, RIGHT (4,6) empty. So 3 safe moves.  \n\nFrom (4,7): body becomes [(4,7), (3,7)], tail gone. Next turn from (4,7): LEFT (3,7) my body \u2192 invalid, UP (4,8) empty (apple), DOWN (4,6) empty, RIGHT (5,7) empty (apple). So 3 safe moves.  \n\nAll three options give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is at (3,1) with length 4, likely to eat apple at (3,0)? No apple at (3,0). They might move toward (2,1) or (4,1) where no apples. They are far from me now (6 rows away). I should focus on eating apples quickly.  \n\nUP to (3,8) puts me next to apple (4,8) for next turn.  \nRIGHT to (4,7) puts me next to apple (5,7) for next turn.  \n\nBoth are good. UP keeps me near top where more apples: (5,9), (6,9), (9,8), (9,6) etc.  \nRIGHT leads to more apples in row 7: (6,7), (7,7).  \n\nI think UP is slightly better because it keeps me farther from enemy\u2019s eventual path upward.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go UP now to (3,8), next turn I can go RIGHT to (4,8) to eat apple, then assess. Avoid moving toward enemy until I\u2019m longer.  \n\n---\n\n**Final decision:**  \nUP to (3,8).  \n\nUP",

Wait \u2014 I have 2 apples collected, length = apples + 2? Let\u2019s check: start length 2, ate apple last turn \u2192 length 3 now. If I move without eating apple this turn, length stays 3, tail moves from (3,7) to (3,8)? Actually: current body: head (4,8), then (3,8), then (3,7). If I move to (4,9) without eating, new body: [(4,9), (4,8), (3,8)], tail (3,7) disappears. So length 3 still.  \n\nFrom (4,9) next turn:  \n- DOWN (4,8) my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT (3,9) empty.  \n- RIGHT (5,9) apple.  \n- UP off board \u2192 invalid.  \nSo 2 safe moves, one leads to apple.  \n\nIf DOWN to (4,7):  \nNew body: [(4,7), (4,8), (3,8)], tail (3,7) gone.  \n\nFrom (4,7) next turn:  \n- UP (4,8) my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN (4,6) empty.  \n- LEFT (3,7) empty.  \n- RIGHT (5,7) apple.  \nSo 3 safe moves, one leads to apple.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (5,8):  \nNew body: [(5,8), (4,8), (3,8)], tail (3,7) gone.  \n\nFrom (5,8) next turn:  \n- UP (5,9) apple.  \n- DOWN (5,7) apple.  \n- LEFT (4,8) my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT (6,8) empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves, two lead to apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term considerations:**  \nEnemy is far away in bottom left. I want to keep growing safely.  \nRIGHT (5,8) gives me two apple-adjacent moves next turn and keeps me central.  \nDOWN (4,7) also good, but RIGHT positions me better for (5,9) and (6,9) apples, which are closer to top edge where enemy isn\u2019t.  \n\nAlso, moving RIGHT now avoids getting trapped near top edge after UP.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (5,8), next turn I can go UP to (5,9) apple or DOWN to (5,7) apple. Both safe unless enemy suddenly appears, which is unlikely given their position. Keep collecting apples in top right quadrant while monitoring enemy\u2019s movement toward bottom-left apples.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

No direct collision with the enemy head at (8,8) in either case, as heads moving into the same cell would kill both, but enemy is far right and likely moving up/right.\n\nFollowing last turn's rationale and long-term plan: Prioritize vertical progression in column x=0 to eat (0,9) next (in 3 UP moves from here), then descend to (0,1) and (0,0) for 3 more apples in ~5 total turns, achieving a 6-total lead if uninterrupted. This keeps the safer left edge with banners and avoids potential right-side crowding or traps against the enemy (concentrated right) or borders. RIGHT here opens faster exploration toward (2,6) apple but risks getting boxed in later without a strong apple path yet, and enemy might pressure the center/right.\n\nFrom (0,7): Multiple follow-up options (UP toward apples or RIGHT to expand) without dead-ends, outweighing RIGHT's immediate openness but broader vulnerability.\n\nNext turns: UP x3 to (0,9) for apple 6, then DOWN to (0,8) and assess\u2014drop to (0,1) if column clear, else RIGHT to (1,9) and scan board for safe paths.

However, eating now increases lead over enemy (6 vs 5 apples \u2192 7 vs 5 after this turn). That\u2019s a good advantage.  \n\nCheck if any move leads to more future apples:  \nFrom (9, 8) next turn, UP (9, 9) empty, DOWN (9, 7) empty \u2014 no immediate apples next turn from there.  \nFrom (8, 9) next turn, apples nearby: (6, 9), (5, 9) to the left, but I\u2019d need to navigate.  \nFrom (7, 8) next turn, apples nearby: (6, 9) up-left, (7, 3) far down, (6, 4) down-left.  \n\nActually, apple at (8, 6) is also on board \u2014 that\u2019s reachable later.  \n\nGiven enemy is still at 5 apples, growing to 8 now could let me dominate. Risk of being on edge is moderate but manageable if I plan next move carefully.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go RIGHT and eat apple at (9, 8), next turn from (9, 8) I\u2019ll have UP and DOWN safe. DOWN (9, 7) is safer because it moves away from top edge and opens more future moves (can go LEFT to (8, 7) after tail moves away). UP (9, 9) is corner \u2014 avoid unless necessary. So next turn likely DOWN from (9, 8).  \n\nLEFT or UP now give no apple and same number of safe moves next turn (2), so less growth advantage.  \n\nI\u2019ll take the apple now to extend lead.  \n\nRIGHT",

That\u2019s risky if enemy approaches.  \nDOWN \u2192 (9, 7) leaves me with only DOWN possible next turn, but that goes to (9, 6) which has an apple.  \n\nCheck enemy\u2019s possible moves:  \nEnemy at (0, 7) could go UP to (0, 8) or RIGHT to (1, 7).  \nApple at (0, 9) is near enemy\u2019s UP path.  \n\nIf I go DOWN now, next turn I can eat apple at (9, 6) if still there (enemy can\u2019t reach it in one turn). That\u2019s a growth opportunity.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI need to avoid getting trapped. UP seems worse because (9, 9) \u2192 only LEFT to (8, 9) next turn, then maybe up-left toward apples at (6,9)/(5,9), but I\u2019ll be along top edge with limited moves.  \n\nDOWN now \u2192 (9, 7) \u2192 next turn DOWN to (9, 6) apple \u2192 grow to length 9, then from (9, 6) I\u2019ll have more options: LEFT (8,6) apple? Actually apple at (8,6) is there now, but could be eaten by enemy? Unlikely, enemy is far left.  \n\nActually, checking board: apple at (8,6) is present. If I go DOWN now to (9,7), then next turn DOWN to (9,6) apple, then turn after that I could go LEFT to (8,6) apple possibly. That\u2019s two apples in two turns if safe.  \n\nBut wait: from (9,7) only DOWN is safe next turn, so I must go to (9,6). That\u2019s fine.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Compare risks:**  \nUP \u2192 1 safe move next turn, no apple now, corner.  \nDOWN \u2192 1 safe move next turn, but leads to apple next turn.  \n\nSo DOWN is better for growth.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (9,7), next turn I must go DOWN to (9,6) to eat apple. Then from (9,6) I\u2019ll have:  \n- UP (9,7) \u2013 my body (if tail hasn\u2019t cleared) \u2192 maybe invalid depending on tail position.  \n- DOWN (9,5) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT (8,6) \u2013 apple.  \n- RIGHT off board \u2192 invalid.  \nSo likely 2 safe moves next turn after eating apple at (9,6). That\u2019s better than corner.  \n\nI\u2019ll go DOWN now to set up apple next turn and keep growth lead.  \n\nDOWN",

Moving RIGHT frees me from the wall, creating more future options like turning down later for bottom apples (e.g., (5,0), (9,0), (0,1)).\n\nAmong safe moves (only RIGHT), I choose it because it keeps multiple follow-up avenues open, positions me closer to exploring the board, and avoids traps like lingering near the wall. Enemy snake at (9,6) with body dominating the right side might threaten top apples like (5,9), so spreading to the center or down lowers head-on collision risk. Next turn from (1,9), I can evaluate RIGHT to (2,9) or DOWN to (1,8) for best apple access.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to escape the left wall permanently. From there, proceed RIGHT along the top row (staying clear of enemy hazards in columns 5-9) until reaching around x=3-4, then pivot DOWN or LEFT to sweep the bottom row for apples like (5,0), (9,0), or (4,1).

This maintains space and avoids trapping myself on the right edge.  \n\nLEFT",

New body: [(7,3), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7)]  \n\nFrom (7,3) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (7,4) \u2013 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,2) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,3) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,3) \u2013 empty.  \nSo three safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT), none lead to apple immediately visible (apples at (6,4), (4,2), (3,3) nearby but not adjacent).  \n\n**LEFT to (6, 4):**  \nApple at (6,4) \u2192 eat apple, grow to length 12. New body: [(6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7)]  \n\nFrom (6,4) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (6,5) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,3) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,4) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,4) \u2013 my body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo three safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT), none lead to apple immediately adjacent.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Compare:**  \nUP: no apple, reduces next-turn options to 2 moves.  \nDOWN: eat apple (7,3), keep 3 moves next turn, but moves away from other apples.  \nLEFT: eat apple (6,4), keep 3 moves next turn, positions near center.  \n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT give +1 apple, but LEFT keeps me closer to more apples in center (like (4,2), (3,3), (5,1), (4,1)) and away from enemy who is top row.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI have a lead (10 vs 6). Eating apples is good but must avoid trapping. LEFT to (6,4) gives good central position, multiple exits next turn, and I can go DOWN to (6,3) then LEFT/DOWN to reach lower apples, or UP to (6,5) to go toward (5,9) area later.  \n\nEnemy might eat (5,9) or (6,9) soon, but that\u2019s far from me. I should secure apples in middle and lower half.  \n\nLEFT seems best for growth and flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,4), consider moving DOWN to (6,3) to open path toward (4,2) and (3,3) apples, or LEFT to (5,4) toward (5,1) area. Avoid going UP into possible congestion near enemy later.  \n\nLEFT",

While it scores one apple now, it limits future moves and risks getting trapped, potentially allowing the enemy (at 11 apples) to maneuver freely or close gaps. DOWN to (7,8) keeps the board open (row 8 has many empty spots), allows a path LEFT to eat (5,8) next turn for another apple, and maintains options to shift toward bottom-cluster apples like (9,0) or (5,0). This avoids the top-right trap, prioritizes safety over short-term greed, and aligns with avoiding entrapment while eating apples. Enemy head at (5,3) could move toward row 8, but DOWN doesn't invite head-on collisions and leaves escape routes.\n\nUpdated long-term plan: Use DOWN to access (5,8), then LEFT toward it, bypassing the top-right corner trap at (9,9) since eating (8,9) and (9,9) isolates me. Instead, pivot down to (7,8)/(5,8) for quick points, using open row 8/7 spaces to target row 5's (9,4) and left-side apples (e.g., (0,5)).

DOWN also works but moves me closer to enemy body dangers in rows 4+ without immediate eats, risking tighter paths later around areas like row 5's clutter. Enemy head at (4,1) could go LEFT to (3,1) or DOWN to (4,0), both far from me, no immediate collision or block risks. Apples remain plentiful (e.g., (5,5) near reachable), and my 9 apples lag enemy at 13, so prioritize long-term positioning for multiple eats over short-term stagnation.\n\nLong-term plan: From (4,8), scan for eats like (5,5) by turning LEFT one more to (3,8) for absolute row 8 openness, then DOUBLE-DOWN southward around turns 26-28 (e.g., LEFT to (3,8), then DOWN to (3,7), extend to (4,6-5) if clear) to hit row 5/6 apples ((5,5), (2,6)) safely away from enemy's probable downward push toward row 0/1 Eats.

Safety first. UP is too risky.  \nRIGHT is safest in terms of future mobility.  \nDOWN gives an apple but reduces mobility next turn \u2014 but enemy is far, so maybe okay? Still, being on bottom row with only 2 moves could be dangerous if enemy approaches later.  \n\nBetter to keep mobility high. Choose RIGHT now, then next turn from (6, 1) I can go DOWN to (6, 0) or RIGHT to (7, 1) to stay flexible, maybe aim for (7, 3) apple in 2 turns.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 1), go DOWN to (6, 0) to avoid boxing in, then consider moving toward left side apples (0,0), (0,1) or up toward (5,5), (3,3).

My possible moves (6, 2), (6, 0), (7, 1) are far from those. No head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Evaluate each safe move:**  \n\n**UP to (6, 2):**  \nNo apple. New body: [(6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6)] \u2014 tail (9, 8) removed.  \n\nFrom (6, 2) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 3) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 1) \u2013 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 2) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 2) \u2013 empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n**DOWN to (6, 0):**  \nNo apple.

Still, bottom row limits mobility.  \nRIGHT (7, 1) \u2192 no apple now, 3 safe moves next turn, closer to (7, 3) apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI have a lead (14 vs 9 apples). Safety and mobility are key.  \nDOWN reduces mobility too much.  \nUP and RIGHT both give 3 safe moves next turn.  \nRIGHT moves me toward (7, 3) apple and keeps me away from enemy (who is top left).  \nUP moves me toward center but also toward my own body in column 6 above y=4.  \n\nLooking at board: my body occupies (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), etc. If I go UP to (6, 2), then UP again to (6, 3), I\u2019m one step below my body at (6, 4) \u2014 could be okay, but limits upward movement soon.  \nRIGHT to (7, 1) then UP to (7, 2) then UP to (7, 3) gets apple in 2 turns with good space.  \n\nBetter to go RIGHT now for flexibility and apple path.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 1), go UP to (7, 2) to approach (7, 3) apple, or DOWN to (7, 0) to avoid boxing in if needed. Keep enemy far away.  \n\nRIGHT",

UP is excluded as it would reverse into my own neck at (3,7), leading to death. No moves risk exiting the board (10x10 grid) or colliding with enemy bodies on this turn, though simultaneous head movements remain a risk.\n\nPrioritizing apple consumption to close the 9-14 apple gap (especially with 121 turns potentially left before 150), LEFT to eat (2,6) is the strongest move available. It allows growth, maintains flexibility in row 6 for future zigzagging/zagging (e.g., toward southwest apples like (5,5) or left-cluster options), and avoids tighter spaces. RIGHT or DOWN might edge closer to apples but delay eating/growth without an immediate payoff. Enemy snake at (7,2) could threaten northern areas, but this LEFT move positions me well south for chaining without obvious traps yet.\n\n**Long-term plan for next 3-5 turns:** After eating (2,6), head at (2,6)\u2014snake will stretch across row 6. Prioritize zigzagging east/west in row 6 (RIGHT to (3,6) or further east if safe, or LEFT if backtracking opens paths, but avoid U-turn reversals like repeating DOWN shortly). Target chaining (5,5) via shifts south to row 5 by turn ~32-35, while monitoring enemy surges north (e.g., from (7,2) toward (7,3); counter by staying flexible in row 6 to evade or loop south if they advance). If row 6 gets constricted by enemy (e.g., if they block east), loop south earlier via DOWN. Avoid DOWN immediately if it forces vertical stacks near enemy tail. Aim to eat 2-3 apps by turn 35 to hit ~12-13, closing gap while keeping options open for board control.\n\nLEFT",

No risks of exiting the board or colliding with enemy bodies this turn, and no immediate head-on collision threats since the enemy head is at (8,2) and far away.\n\nAmong safe moves, DOWN appears strongest: it starts positioning toward row 5's apples at (0,5) and (5,5), helps close the apple gap (me at 10, enemy at 14, with many turns left), and maintains flexibility for zigzag options in a less constrained row. UP opens northern space but risks crowding against the enemy snake's northern body and potential traps with fewer nearby apples. LEFT keeps zigzagging in row 6 toward the west edge, but delays accessing the denser southern apples without immediate payoff.\n\nLong-term plan for next 3-5 turns: After DOWN to (2,5), alter directions (e.g., RIGHT to (3,5)) to zigzag southeast in row 5 toward (5,5) by turn ~33-35 for chaining, while monitoring enemy movements north (e.g., if they surge toward (7,3) or higher, pivot UP sooner to row 6 for evasion and space).

Enemy head at (8,3) is far east, so no immediate head-on threat regardless of my choice.\n\nAmong safe options:\n- DOWN prolongs zigzagging west-southwest in rows 4-5, which opens paths toward apples like (0,0), (0,5), (2,0), and potentially (1,3) or (3,3), but it keeps me in tighter vertical lanes with more future constraints against my growing body and enemy encroachment north (their head could move south/east toward row 3-5 apples like (7,3) or (3,3)).\n- LEFT moves west in row 5 toward (0,5) apple or (1,3), but row 5 west has apple at (0,5) and open space, making it flexible for loops or backtracking. However, it delays the denser southeast apple cluster (e.g., (5,5), (9,4)) and might lead to edge crowding if I grow further.\n- RIGHT moves east in row 5 toward the (5,5) apple directly (reachable via another RIGHT to (4,5), then RIGHT to (5,5) or DOWN/UP adjustments), positioning for chaining in row 5's open spaces (multiple empties around). Row 5 has fewer obstacles than lower rows, keeps enemy threats distant (they'd need to zig southwest to intersect), and maintains follow-up options (continue east, loop back west, or drop to row 4 for (3,3)/(9,4)).\n\nRIGHT balances short-term apple access (closes on (5,5) or nearby (0,5) if I reverse) with long-term flexibility, avoiding row stagnation. It aligns with the prior plan to zigzag southeast early to eat apples by turn 33-35, aiming for 11-12 apples ahead of enemy's 14. If row 5 fills (e.g., after growth), pivot to row 4 for evasion.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, check:  \nFrom last turn: I moved RIGHT from (8,3) to (9,3), so new head (9,3), previous head (8,3) becomes second segment, tail (8,5) was removed. Yes, tail now is (8,4) because snake didn\u2019t grow.  \n\n**Enemy snake #0:**  \nHead: (3, 5)  \nBody: [(2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9)]  \nLength: 11  \n\n**Apples nearby:** (9, 4), (9, 2), (7, 3), (8, 9), (9, 9), (5, 5), (1, 3), (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 5), (5, 0), (9, 0)  \n\n---\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Possible moves from (9, 3):**  \n- UP \u2192 (9, 4) \u2013 apple!  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 2) \u2013 apple!  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 3) \u2013 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n\nValid: UP, DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy head at (3, 5) possible moves:**  \n- UP \u2192 (3, 6) \u2013 its own body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 4) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 5) \u2013 its own body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 5) \u2013 empty.  \n\nEnemy safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Immediate collision risk:**  \nEnemy could go to (3, 4) or (4, 5). My moves (9, 4) and (9, 2) are far away. No head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Evaluate each safe move:**  \n\n**UP to (9, 4):**  \nApple at (9, 4) \u2192 eat it \u2192 grow by 1 \u2192 length 16.  \nNew body: head (9, 4), then (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4) \u2014 tail stays (8,4) because growth.  \nFrom (9, 4) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (9, 5) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 3) \u2013 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 4) \u2013 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \nSo only 1 safe move (UP to (9, 5)) after eating apple \u2014 risky, could trap myself.  \n\n**DOWN to (9, 2):**  \nApple at (9, 2) \u2192 eat it \u2192 grow by 1 \u2192 length 16.  \nNew body: head (9, 2), then (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4) \u2014 tail stays (8,4).  \nFrom (9, 2) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (9, 3) \u2013 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 1) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 2) \u2013 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \nSo only 1 safe move (DOWN to (9, 1)) after eating apple \u2014 also risky.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Compare moves:**  \nBoth moves give an apple but leave only one safe move next turn. That\u2019s dangerous.  \nBut maybe I can choose one that gives more options later.  \n\nCheck board:  \nIf I go UP to (9,4) and grow, then next turn only UP to (9,5). From (9,5):  \n- UP \u2192 (9,6) empty  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,4) body  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,5) empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board  \nSo at (9,5) I\u2019d have UP and LEFT safe. That\u2019s better than it seems \u2014 so maybe not a dead end immediately.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (9,2) and grow, then next turn only DOWN to (9,1). From (9,1):  \n- UP \u2192 (9,2) body  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,0) apple  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,1) empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board  \nSo at (9,1) I\u2019d have DOWN and LEFT safe.  \n\nBoth seem similar.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019m at the right edge, so I need to eventually go left.  \nGoing UP to (9,4) then UP to (9,5) then maybe LEFT to (8,5) gets me closer to center.  \nGoing DOWN to (9,2) then DOWN to (9,1) then maybe LEFT to (8,1) also works.  \n\nBut check enemy: enemy at (3,5) could move DOWN to (3,4) or RIGHT to (4,5). Not threatening me yet.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose UP because (9,5) is closer to apples like (8,9), (9,9), and gives more space upward before hitting top edge.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter UP to (9,4) and eating apple, next turn only safe move is UP to (9,5). Then from (9,5) I can go UP or LEFT. Choose LEFT to (8,5) to move toward board center and open more options.  \n\nUP",
