Check each direction for immediate death:**  \n\n- **UP** \u2192 (2, 2)  \n  \u2705 On board.  \n  \u2705 Not touching own body (body is at (2, 0) only).  \n  \u2705 Snake 1 head far away.  \n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2, 0)  \n   \u274c That\u2019s my tail? Wait \u2014 tail is part of body. Moving into it kills me (rule: move into own body = death).  \n   \u274c Not safe.  \n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1, 1)  \n  \u2705 On board.  \n  \u2705 No body segments here currently.  \n  \u2705 No enemy head here.  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3, 1)  \n  \u2705 On board.  \n  \u2705 Empty.  \n\nSo UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.  \n\n---\n\n**2. Apples and strategy**  \n\nApples nearby:  \n- (0, 1) \u2014 1 move away LEFT then DOWN?? Wait check: from (2,1), LEFT to (1,1), then LEFT again to (0,1) eats it. That\u2019s pretty safe path because enemy far.  \n- (8, 1) \u2014 far right.  \n- (1, 3) \u2014 two moves away if I go UP then LEFT.  \n\nClosest apple is actually (0, 1) \u2192 need to go LEFT now to start path to it.  \n\nGoing UP to (2, 2) gets me *away* from that closest apple, but maybe positions me for (1, 3) next.  \n\nEnemy is at (6,8), heading probably towards (1,9) apple.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Future options after each move**  \n\n- **UP (2, 2):** Next moves: UP to (2, 3), LEFT to (1, 2), RIGHT to (3, 2). All fine. Gets me closer to (1, 3).  \n- **LEFT (1, 1):** Next moves: UP (1, 2), LEFT (0, 1) apple, RIGHT back to (2, 1) (safe since tail moved? Actually next turn tail moves forward; let\u2019s check: after moving left to (1,1), body becomes [(2,1),(2,0)]? Wait correction \u2014 when moving without eating apple, the tail moves: head goes to (1,1), tail at (2,0) disappears, new tail segment at old head?(No: process: head moves to (1,1), body segments follow: body was [(2,0)], so now head at (1,1), body at [(2,1)]?? Let\u2019s track precisely:  \n\nSnake length 2: H(2,1)-B(2,0)  \nMove LEFT: new head at (1,1), then body segments shift: first body segment goes to old head (2,1), tail (last segment) at old first body segment\u2019s old spot is gone. So new body: [(2,1)], yes. So after moving LEFT without eating apple: snake at H(1,1) B(2,1).  \n\nSo after LEFT: possible next moves from (1,1): UP (1,2), DOWN (1,0), LEFT (0,1) apple. RIGHT (2,1) is occupied by body \u2192 unsafe. So actually only 3 safe moves still (UP, DOWN, LEFT). DOWN is safe since (1,0) empty.  \n\nActually check: (1,0) on board and empty, yes. So 3 moves.  \n\n---\n\nImportant: I should check apple at (1,1)? No apple there. So LEFT doesn\u2019t eat now.  \n\nThe apple at (0,1) is close but I\u2019d get it next turn if I move LEFT now and then LEFT again. But after eating it then, I\u2019d grow to length 3. Might trap myself near corner (0,1) with fewer exits.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Evaluate safest high-growth path**  \n\nLong-term: corner (0,1) is risky after eating there because exits are limited. Better to go for (1,3) via UP now. That path keeps me more central.  \n\nUP now \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 next turn can go LEFT (1,2) \u2192 then UP (1,3) apple. That area less cramped.  \n\nAlso avoids potential head-on if snake #1 eventually comes down left side, but currently he\u2019s top right.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Decision**  \n\nUP: advances toward (1,3), keeps future options open, safe.  \nRIGHT: goes toward center but no apple immediate gain and near enemy later.  \nLEFT: gets me toward (0,1) but riskier corner.  \n\nBetter: choose **UP**.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (2,2), go LEFT to (1,2) aiming for apple (1,3), avoiding dead ends.

Yes, so no apple in adjacent cells.  \n\nWait, apple list: (1, 9), (9, 0), (0, 1), (8, 1), (7, 5). None adjacent to my head (1,3).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Future mobility**  \n\nAfter each safe move:  \n\n- **UP** to (1,4): safe, central position; can reach apples (1,9) upwards long path.  \n- **DOWN** to (1,2): closer to (0,1) apple in 2 more moves if safe next turns.  \n- **LEFT** to (0,3): partially cornered (left edge), but can still go UP/DOWN next turn. Closer to (0,1) \u2014 DOWN from (0,3) to (0,2) then (0,1) gets apple in 2 moves.\n\nShort-term plan: Get apple (0,1) safely. If I go LEFT now, enemy might head toward (1,9) apple; enemy at (4,9): Manhattan to (1,9) = 3 steps, to (0,1) = 12 steps, so it will probably go for (1,9). We can secure (0,1) apple with less competition.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Risk of collision with enemy**  \n\nEnemy safe moves from (4,9): UP invalid, DOWN (4,8), LEFT (3,9), RIGHT (5,9) into own body \u2014 no. So enemy can only go DOWN or LEFT. Either way, enemy cannot reach my possible destinations (1,2), (0,3), (1,4) in 1 move \u2014 safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Choose best option**  \n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT:  \nLEFT (0,3): closer to apple path, but on edge \u2014 slightly reduces future moves.  \nDOWN (1,2): still central, can go LEFT (0,2) next toward apple, keeps flexibility.  \nDOWN seems better for keeping mobility while progressing toward (0,1) apple.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for upcoming turns:**  \nGo for (0,1) apple: likely path: this turn DOWN to (1,2), next turn if safe LEFT to (0,2), then DOWN to (0,1) to eat. Avoid trapping self in corner. Watch enemy movement toward top row apple (1,9) \u2014 low conflict path.\n\nDOWN",

This is the shortest path to an apple.  \n\nOther moves:  \n- DOWN to (1, 0) \u2014 no apple, but safe.  \n- RIGHT to (2, 1) \u2014 no apple, moves away from apple at (0, 1).  \n\nLEFT is clearly beneficial for score.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Safety after eating apple**  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 1) and eat apple, my body becomes: head (0, 1), body [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)].  \nNext turn from (0, 1):  \n- UP (0, 2) \u2014 safe (empty).  \n- DOWN (0, 0) \u2014 safe (empty).  \n- RIGHT (1, 1) \u2014 safe (empty next turn because my old head moves).  \n\nSo no immediate trap after eating apple.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Enemy threat**  \n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (2, 9), body [(3, 9)].  \nPossible moves for enemy: UP (2, 9) off board? Wait, y=9 is top row, so UP is off board \u2192 invalid.  \nEnemy\u2019s safe moves: LEFT (1, 9) \u2014 empty, DOWN (2, 8) \u2014 empty, RIGHT (3, 9) into own body \u274c.  \nSo enemy can go LEFT or DOWN.  \n\nLEFT (1, 9) is far from me, no conflict. Enemy is far away, so no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Future mobility**  \n\nEating apple at (0, 1) puts me on the west edge, but I\u2019ll have 3 possible exits next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good.  \n\nRIGHT or DOWN now delay apple consumption unnecessarily.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Long-term plan after this move**  \n\nOnce I eat apple (0, 1), next closest apples: (8, 1) and (7, 5).  \nFrom (0, 1), move toward center to avoid getting stuck on edge for too long. Possibly go RIGHT next to (1, 1) then plan path to (8, 1) via bottom row.  \n\nWatch enemy movement \u2014 they might go for (1, 9) apple soon.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT to eat apple immediately and grow.\n\nLEFT",

Wait, check:  \nCurrent body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)].  \nIf I move UP to (0, 2), new body: head (0, 2), then (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2) \u2014 tail (1, 3) disappears? No \u2014 I didn\u2019t eat apple, so length stays same: head (0, 2), body [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)].  \nSo next turn from (0, 2):  \n- UP (0, 3) \u2014 safe.  \n- DOWN (0, 1) \u2014 my body \u274c.  \n- LEFT off board \u274c.  \n- RIGHT (1, 2) \u2014 my body \u274c.  \n\nSo after UP, next turn only UP is safe \u2014 dead end! Dangerous.\n\n---\n\n**DOWN to (0, 0)**:  \nNew body: head (0, 0), body [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)].  \nNext turn from (0, 0):  \n- UP (0, 1) \u2014 my body \u274c.  \n- DOWN off board \u274c.  \n- LEFT off board \u274c.  \n- RIGHT (1, 0) \u2014 empty \u2705.  \n\nSo after DOWN, only RIGHT is safe next turn \u2014 also dead end? But RIGHT (1, 0) then from there:  \nPossible moves from (1, 0): UP (1, 1) my body? Wait, next turn body would be [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)], so (1, 1) is body \u274c, DOWN off \u274c, LEFT (0, 0) body \u274c, RIGHT (2, 0) empty \u2705.  \nSo indeed, after DOWN then RIGHT, I\u2019d have only RIGHT again \u2014 I\u2019d be stuck along bottom edge with only right moves until I hit wall \u2014 very bad.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Rethink \u2014 maybe I missed something**  \n\nActually, check: after UP to (0, 2), next turn only UP safe \u2014 yes, that\u2019s a trap.  \nAfter DOWN to (0, 0), next turn only RIGHT safe \u2014 also a trap.  \n\nSo both safe moves lead to immediate dead ends next turn? That means I must have made a mistake earlier \u2014 maybe I can go to (0, 1) last turn was wrong? Wait, I had to eat apple, so maybe unavoidable.\n\nBut let\u2019s check: Could I have avoided this? Last turn I ate apple at (0, 1), so my body includes (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3) plus new head at (0, 1) \u2014 old head was (1, 1) \u2014 yes, so body is [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)] plus growth? Wait, growth happens after eating apple:  \nBefore eating: head (1, 1), body [(1, 2), (1, 3)] length 3.  \nEat apple at (0, 1): new head (0, 1), body [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)] length 4.  \nYes, so now at (0, 1) with body behind me blocking RIGHT and UP? No, UP (0, 2) is free. DOWN (0, 0) free. LEFT off board. RIGHT body.  \n\nSo indeed, now I\u2019m stuck next turn if I move.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Which is less bad?**  \n\nUP to (0, 2) \u2192 next turn only UP (0, 3) safe, then from (0, 3) only UP again \u2014 I go up the left wall until (0, 9). That gives me several turns before dead end at top, maybe find a way out earlier if apple appears?  \n\nDOWN to (0, 0) \u2192 next turn only RIGHT (1, 0) safe, then along bottom to (9, 0) \u2014 apple at (9, 0) is there, so I could eat it at (9, 0) and grow, which might change mobility.  \n\nEating apple extends body but head moves forward \u2014 if I eat at (9, 0), my body will trail behind, possibly allowing more moves after.  \n\nSo DOWN path leads to an apple in 9 steps, UP path has no apple on path.  \n\nBetter to go DOWN -> RIGHT toward apple (9, 0).\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Enemy threat**  \n\nEnemy at (1, 9) far away, no interaction.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Final choice**  \n\nDOWN leads to a path with an apple, UP leads to a dead end with no apple.  \nSo DOWN is better.\n\n---\n\n**Next turn plan:**  \nAfter DOWN to (0, 0), must go RIGHT next turn, then continue RIGHT along bottom to (9, 0) apple. Hope enemy doesn\u2019t block. Keep moving to avoid trap.\n\nDOWN",

But UP leaves more options after eating apple at (9, 4) since I can go LEFT to (8, 4) afterward.  \nDOWN leads to (9, 0) but after eating, only UP is possible, which is my body initially \u2014 but wait, after eating, my tail moves, so (9, 2) might be free? Let's check:  \nIf I go DOWN to (9, 1) \u2192 eat apple at (9, 0) next turn \u2192 body grows so tail stays \u2014 actually, after eating at (9, 0), my body will be: head (9, 0), then (9, 1), then (9, 2), etc. So from (9, 0), UP to (9, 1) is body \u274c, so only LEFT/RIGHT? LEFT (8, 0) empty \u2705, RIGHT off \u274c, so only LEFT. That\u2019s still 1 option.  \n\nUP path: after eating (9, 4), I can go LEFT (8, 4) or DOWN (9, 3) \u2014 but (9, 3) is my body after moving there? Let's simulate:  \nNow: head (9, 2), body includes (8, 2), etc.  \nMove UP: head (9, 3), body becomes [(9, 2), (8, 2), ...]  \nNext turn UP: head (9, 4) apple \u2192 body becomes [(9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), ...] \u2014 after eating, from (9, 4), possible moves: DOWN (9, 3) \u274c body, LEFT (8, 4) \u2705 empty, RIGHT off \u274c, UP off \u274c. So only LEFT. Hmm, same 1 option after eating.  \n\nSo both UP and DOWN lead to a dead-end after eating the apple? Wait, but I can plan to avoid that by not eating apple immediately if it traps me.  \n\nActually, better to check:  \nFrom (9, 3) before eating apple: moves: UP (9, 4) apple, LEFT (8, 3) empty. So if I go to (9, 3), I don\u2019t have to eat apple immediately \u2014 I can go LEFT to (8, 3) to keep more space. That\u2019s smarter: go UP this turn, then next turn decide whether to eat apple or go LEFT for more space.  \n\nFrom (9, 1) before eating apple: moves: DOWN (9, 0) apple, LEFT (8, 1) \u274c body. So only 1 move \u2014 must eat apple next turn. That\u2019s riskier.  \n\nThus UP is better \u2014 more flexibility next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy snake**  \nEnemy head at (5, 5). Far away, no immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term space**  \nUP keeps options open: next turn I can either eat (9, 4) or go LEFT to (8, 3) for more space.  \nDOWN forces me into a corner with fewer options.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Final choice**  \nUP is optimal \u2014 safe, leads toward apple with flexibility, better mobility next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (9, 3), if (8, 3) is safe next turn, consider going LEFT to open space instead of immediately eating apple if it risks trapping. Otherwise, eat apple and then navigate carefully along top edge toward middle apples.  \n\nUP",

Wait \u2014 let\u2019s double-check collision rules:  \n- DOWN to (7, 7): enemy head is currently at (7, 7), but enemy will also move this turn. So I need to check where enemy can go and where I\u2019ll end up.  \n\nActually, simultaneous movement:  \nIf enemy moves away from (7, 7), then (7, 7) could be safe. But if enemy stays or moves into me, collision possible.  \n\nLet\u2019s check enemy\u2019s possible moves from (7, 7):  \nEnemy\u2019s body: [(6, 7), (6, 8), \u2026] so:  \nEnemy\u2019s safe moves from (7, 7):  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 8) \u2192 my head? That\u2019s head-on collision if both go into same cell.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 6) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 7) \u2192 enemy body \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 7) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n\nSo enemy can go DOWN or RIGHT safely.  \n\nIf enemy goes UP to (7, 8) and I go DOWN to (7, 7), we swap positions \u2014 no collision because we don\u2019t occupy same cell simultaneously.  \n\nBut if enemy stays at (7, 7) (impossible because UP is into my head? Actually UP is into my head\u2019s current position (7,8) \u2014 but that\u2019s not safe for enemy because my head is there now? Wait, simultaneous move: enemy doesn\u2019t check my current head position as obstacle, but after move, if two heads occupy same cell \u2192 both die. So enemy going UP to (7,8) would kill both if I also go there \u2014 but I\u2019m not going UP.  \n\nSo:  \nIf I go DOWN to (7,7):  \n- If enemy stays at (7,7) \u2192 impossible because enemy must move.  \n- If enemy moves UP to (7,8) \u2192 I go to (7,7) \u2192 safe.  \n- If enemy moves DOWN to (7,6) \u2192 safe.  \n- If enemy moves RIGHT to (8,7) \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo (7,7) will be empty after enemy moves unless enemy stays (impossible) or some other snake moves there (none).  \n\nBut wait \u2014 enemy\u2019s body segment at (6,7) means enemy can\u2019t go LEFT, so enemy\u2019s only safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT. So enemy will leave (7,7). Therefore (7,7) is safe for me to move into.  \n\nSo DOWN is safe.  \n\nSimilarly check others:  \nUP: (7,9) is my body \u2014 unsafe.  \nLEFT: (6,8) is enemy body \u2014 unsafe (static body, not moving).  \nRIGHT: (8,8) is my body \u2014 unsafe.  \n\nSo only DOWN is safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Confirming**  \nYes \u2014 enemy must move, and enemy\u2019s only safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT, so (7,7) will be free.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Next turn lookahead**  \nIf I go DOWN to (7,7):  \nFrom (7,7):  \n- UP \u2192 (7,8) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,7) \u2192 enemy body \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,7) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n\nSo 3 options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApple at (7,2) is below; going DOWN gets me closer.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy threat**  \nEnemy head will be at either (7,6) if DOWN or (8,7) if RIGHT. Either way, I\u2019ll be at (7,7) with space to maneuver.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nAfter this move, head toward (7,2) apple while avoiding being trapped by enemy. Keep options open \u2014 maybe go DOWN again next if enemy is at (8,7), else RIGHT/DOWN toward apples on right edge later.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",
