I have 1 apple so far.\n- Snake #1: Head at (7,9), no body.\n- Apples: (1,0), (8,8), (9,2), (0,3), (5,8)\n\nLast turn I moved LEFT and must have eaten the apple that was at (2,6)? But it says \"Apples collected: 1\" and my head is now at (2,6) with body at (3,6). So the apple at (2,6) is gone? Wait, the board state shows no apple at (2,6) now. The apples listed are at (1,0), (8,8), (9,2), (0,3), (5,8). So (2,6) is not an apple anymore. I must have eaten it last turn.\n\nCurrent head position is (2,6), and my body is at (3,6). So I just ate an apple and grew to length 2.\n\nNow, possible moves:\n- LEFT to (1,6): empty space.\n- RIGHT to (3,6): my own body (tail) - would die.\n- UP to (2,7): empty.\n- DOWN to (2,5): empty.\n\nSo RIGHT is unsafe (hitting my own tail). LEFT, UP, DOWN are safe.\n\nNow, which apple to target?\n- (1,0) is far away (distance 6 in x and 6 in y).\n- (8,8) is even farther.\n- (9,2) is far.\n- (0,3) is closer: x=0, y=3. My head at (2,6): dx=2, dy=3.\n- (5,8) is at x=5,y=8: dx=3, dy=2.\n\nSo (0,3) and (5,8) are relatively closer.\n\nBut also, snake #1 is at (7,9) and might be going for (5,8) or (8,8). I should go for (0,3) to avoid conflict.\n\nTo go to (0,3):\n- I need to decrease x and decrease y.\n- From (2,6), LEFT (decrease x) and DOWN (decrease y) are both helpful.\n\nSpecifically, LEFT to (1,6) gets me closer in x, and DOWN to (2,5) gets me closer in y.\n\nAlso, I should consider future moves: after this move, I need to avoid hitting my body which will be at (2,6) (current head becomes body) and (3,6) (current tail).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1,6):\n- Next turn head at (1,6), body segments: (2,6) and (3,6).\n- Then I can go LEFT to (0,6), DOWN to (1,5), or UP to (1,7). RIGHT to (2,6) would hit body.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2,5):\n- Next turn head at (2,5), body: (2,6) and (3,6).\n- Then I can go LEFT to (1,5), DOWN to (2,4), RIGHT to (3,5) (safe? (3,6) is body but (3,5) is free), or UP to (2,6) which is body.\n\nSo LEFT gives me 3 options next turn, DOWN gives me 3 options (LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT) but RIGHT is safe only if (3,5) is free (which it is).\n\nBoth are good.\n\nBut to go to (0,3), LEFT is directly towards it in x. DOWN is also towards it in y, but I need to go left eventually.\n\nAlso, there is an apple at (1,0) which is near (0,3), so going left/down sets me up for both.\n\nI should avoid going UP because it takes me away from (0,3) and (1,0).\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN, both are safe and good.\n\nLEFT: (1,6) - no apple there, but closer to (0,3).\nDOWN: (2,5) - no apple, but also closer.\n\nWhich one gives more future options? Both similar.\n\nI could also consider the risk of snake #1: it is at (7,9) and might come down. But far away, so low risk.\n\nI think LEFT is slightly better because it directly reduces x towards 0.\n\nSo I choose LEFT.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nHead towards (0,3) and then (1,0). Avoid going right into the center where snake #1 might be. Keep an eye on snake #1's movements as it grows.\n\nLEFT",

I have collected 2 apples.\n- Apples at: (1,0), (9,2), (0,3), (5,8), (2,7) \u2014 the apple at (2,7) is new (not in previous list?).\n- Snake #1: Head at (6,8), Body: [(7,8)], has 1 apple.\n\nFrom head at (2,4), possible moves:\n- **LEFT**: (1,4) \u2014 currently empty (board shows '.' at (1,4)), safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (3,4) \u2014 currently empty ('.' at (3,4)), safe.\n- **UP**: (2,5) \u2014 this is my own body segment (second segment), unsafe (would die).\n- **DOWN**: (2,3) \u2014 currently empty ('.' at (2,3)), safe.\n\nSo safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. UP is unsafe.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- Closest apples: (0,3) is very close (2 moves away: e.g., LEFT then DOWN? Actually (0,3) is at x=0,y=3; I am at (2,4). So moving LEFT to (1,4) and then LEFT again to (0,4) and then DOWN to (0,3) would work. Alternatively, DOWN to (2,3) and then LEFT twice to (0,3)).\n- Another apple at (1,0) is also nearby (but requires going further down).\n- The apple at (2,7) is also relatively close but requires going up (which is currently blocked by my body). However, after a few moves, that path might open.\n- Snake #1 is at (6,8) and is moving toward (5,8) apple? It is not an immediate threat.\n- Long-term plan: Collect the bottom-left apples (0,3) and (1,0) first. They are safe and far from the enemy.\n- After collecting those, consider moving toward (2,7) or (9,2) but avoid Snake #1.\n\nWhich safe move gets me closer to (0,3)?\n- LEFT to (1,4): gets me closer (x decreases, same y).\n- DOWN to (2,3): gets me closer (y decreases, same x).\n- RIGHT to (3,4): takes me away.\n\nSo both LEFT and DOWN are good. RIGHT is less optimal.\n\nFuture flexibility:\n- LEFT to (1,4): next moves from there: LEFT to (0,4) (safe), DOWN to (1,3) (safe), UP to (1,5) \u2014 but (1,5) is my body? Currently (1,5) is my tail? Actually my body is [(2,5), (1,5)] so (1,5) is my tail. Moving into your own tail is safe only if it moves away? Rule: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So moving into (1,5) would kill me. So from (1,4), UP to (1,5) is unsafe. So safe next moves from (1,4) would be LEFT and DOWN.\n- DOWN to (2,3): next moves: LEFT to (1,3) (safe), RIGHT to (3,3) (safe), DOWN to (2,2) (safe). UP to (2,4) is my current head? But I will have moved, so it might be empty? Actually, after I move, my tail will also move? When I eat an apple, I grow, so my tail doesn't move. Currently I have 2 apples collected, so length is 3 (head + 2 body segments). I haven't eaten an apple this turn, so if I move without eating, my tail will move (the last segment is removed). So after moving to (2,3), my body becomes: head at (2,3), then (2,4) [previous head], then (2,5) [first body]. The tail (1,5) is gone. So (2,4) becomes a body segment. So from (2,3), UP to (2,4) would be unsafe (my own body). So safe next moves from (2,3) would be LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n- Therefore, both LEFT and DOWN give 2 safe next moves. DOWN gives slightly more (3 safe moves? Actually LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN are safe; UP is unsafe). So DOWN has 3 safe next moves? Wait: from (2,3):\n  - LEFT: (1,3) \u2014 empty\n  - RIGHT: (3,3) \u2014 empty\n  - DOWN: (2,2) \u2014 empty\n  - UP: (2,4) \u2014 my body (unsafe)\nSo 3 safe moves.\n\nLEFT to (1,4) gives:\n  - LEFT: (0,4) \u2014 empty\n  - DOWN: (1,3) \u2014 empty\n  - UP: (1,5) \u2014 my body (unsafe)\n  - RIGHT: (2,4) \u2014 my body (unsafe)\nSo only 2 safe moves.\n\nTherefore, DOWN offers better future flexibility (3 options vs 2).\n\nAlso, DOWN moves me directly toward (1,0) and (0,3) (decreasing y).\n\nSnake #1 is not a threat at this distance.\n\nSo I choose DOWN.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove DOWN to (2,3) to get closer to the bottom-left apples (0,3) and (1,0). Then likely move LEFT to (1,3) and then to (0,3). After collecting (0,3), go for (1,0). Monitor Snake #1's movement toward (5,8); it is far away and not an immediate concern. Avoid moving into my own body as it grows.\n\nDOWN",

(3,1) is also relatively close.\n- Long-term plan: Target the bottom-left apples (0,3) and (1,0) as they are safe from Snake #1.\n- Snake #1 is at (5,8) and moving toward (5,8) apple?

Moving here is safe and I will eat the apple.\n\nSo safe moves: RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- DOWN to (0,1): This eats the apple. I will grow by one segment. My body will extend (the tail won't move this turn since I'm eating), so my new head will be at (0,1) and my body becomes [(0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3)].\n- RIGHT to (1,2): Doesn't eat an apple, but keeps me safe. From (1,2), next moves could be UP to (1,3) (but (1,3) is my body - would be unsafe unless I eat an apple that makes it grow), DOWN to (1,1), or RIGHT to (2,2). But I would miss the immediate apple.\n\nEating the apple at (0,1) is highly beneficial: it increases my score to 4, extends my length, and puts me closer to the next apple at (1,0). From (0,1) after eating, next turn I can go DOWN to (0,0) (if empty), or RIGHT to (1,1) (if safe), or possibly LEFT (off board) or UP (to (0,2) which is my body, unsafe). So I need to plan ahead.\n\nHowever, eating the apple is the best immediate action. It brings me closer to victory and there is no risk since the cell is safe.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is far away at (3,7) and not a threat currently.\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:** After eating the apple at (0,1), I will be at (0,1) with body [ (0,2), (0,3), (1,3), (2,3) ]. Then, I should consider moving DOWN to (0,0) if it is safe (it is currently empty, but check for changes) or RIGHT to (1,1). The apple at (1,0) is adjacent to (0,0) and (1,1), so I can plan to get it soon.\n\nDOWN",

Actually, after RIGHT, my body segments next turn will be: head at (2, 0), then (1, 0), then (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3) \u2014 so (2, 0) could trap me if I don\u2019t plan ahead because after RIGHT, my valid moves next turn will be UP or maybe DOWN (if not off-board). Let\u2019s check:  \n\nFrom (2, 0): UP (2,1) safe, DOWN off-board, LEFT (1,0) body segment \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT (3,0) safe. So next turn safe moves: UP and RIGHT \u2014 that\u2019s fine.  \n\nIf I go UP to (1, 1) now, next turn safe moves likely: LEFT (0,1) body segment, UP (1,2) empty, RIGHT (2,1) empty, DOWN returns to (1, 0) but next turn that becomes tail end? Let's simulate snake motion:  \n\nCurrently: (1, 0) - (0, 0) - (0, 1) - (0, 2) - (0, 3) - (1, 3)  \n\nAfter move UP to (1, 1): head (1,1); tail moves forward: new body: (1,1) - (1,0) - (0,0) - (0,1) - (0,2) - (0,3) \u2014 last segment (1,3) gone (tail moved off).  \n\nSo from (1, 1) next turn:  \n- LEFT (0,1) \u2192 body segment unsafe (0,1 is in new body)  \n- UP (1,2) \u2192 empty  \n- RIGHT (2,1) \u2192 empty  \n- DOWN (1,0) \u2192 body segment \u2192 unsafe  \n\nSo UP now gives me 2 safe moves next turn (UP, RIGHT). RIGHT now gives 2 safe moves next turn (UP, RIGHT) but positions differently.  \n\nCloser to apples via UP?  \n\nApple at (2, 2):  \nFrom (1,1): path: UP to (1,2) then RIGHT to (2,2) \u2014 2 moves.  \nFrom (2,0): path: UP to (2,1) then UP to (2,2) \u2014 2 moves too.  \n\nBut from (1,1), I\u2019m also closer to (3,1): RIGHT to (2,1) then RIGHT to (3,1).  \n\nUP seems slightly better for central positioning and more options next turn to go towards multiple apples while snake #1 is far.  \n\n**END RATIONALE**  \n\n**Short-term plan:**  \nMove UP to centralize and approach (2,2) and (3,1) next turns.

RIGHT leads to (2,0) \u2014 cornered a bit, but also can go UP next.  \n\nApple (2,2) equally reachable from either path. But (3,1) is easier from (1,1) path.

(2, 2) is directly between us. A move DOWN for me and UP for them is a guaranteed collision.\nMoving **RIGHT** to (3, 3) is safer and sets me up to take (3, 6) or swoop back down if they move away.\n\nStrategy: Avoid the head-on collision at (2, 2). Move RIGHT to (3, 3). This maintains flexibility to grab the apple at (3, 6) or react to Snake #0's position.\n\nRIGHT",

Board shows (1,3) is \".\"  \n- RIGHT: (3,3) is empty?  \n- DOWN: (2,2) is apple (and currently empty)  \n- UP: (2,4) is its own body \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo Snake #1 has safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. It might go DOWN to (2,2) for the apple.  \n\nTherefore, if I go UP to (2,2), there is a risk of head-on collision if Snake #1 also goes DOWN.  \n\nGoing RIGHT to (3,1) is safer: no enemy snake is near (3,1). Snake #1 is at (2,3), and (3,1) is not directly in its path. Also, (3,1) is an apple.  \n\nDOWN to (2,0) is safe but doesn't get an apple, so it's less efficient.  \n\nAfter eating an apple, I grow. So if I go RIGHT to (3,1), new head (3,1), body becomes: [ (2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) ] and I add a segment (so tail doesn't drop). Similarly for UP.  \n\nLong-term: after eating, I need to avoid trapping myself. But with more length, I have to be careful.  \n\nPrioritize getting the apple with lower risk. RIGHT to (3,1) has no competition from Snake #1. UP to (2,2) has competition.  \n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the best move.  \n\n**END RATIONALE**  \n\n**Short-term plan:**  \nMove RIGHT to (3,1) to safely eat the apple. This avoids potential collision with Snake #1 over (2,2). Next turn, from (3,1), I can consider moving to other apples (e.g., (2,2) if still there, or (3,6) later). Keep an eye on Snake #1's movements to avoid head-on collisions.  \n\nRIGHT",

It might be interested in (2,2) or (3,6).  \n\nWhat moves can Snake #1 make from (3,3)?  \nIts body: [(2,3), (2,4), (2,5)]  \nSafe moves for Snake #1:  \n- LEFT: (2,3) is its own body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT: (4,3) is empty \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN: (3,2) is empty \u2192 safe.  \n- UP: (3,4) is empty \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo Snake #1 can go RIGHT, DOWN, or UP.  \n\nIf I go UP to (3,2), Snake #1 might go DOWN to (3,2) as well, causing a head-on collision. That is risky.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (3,0), it is safe but no apple.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4,1), it is safe and moves me toward the eastern apples (like (8,4) and (9,2)), but not directly.  \n\nHowever, going RIGHT might be safer to avoid potential collision with Snake #1. Also, from (4,1), I have many options: UP to (4,2), DOWN to (4,0), or RIGHT to (5,1).  \n\nLooking at the board, after my last move (RIGHT to (3,1)), I ate the apple at (3,1). So now my snake has grown? Actually, the body is still length 6 (because the tail doesn't drop when eating). So next turn, when I move, the tail will not drop (since I ate an apple last turn). So I am effectively length 7? Wait, the body list has 6 segments? Head is (3,1), then (2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)? Actually, the body is given as [(2,1), (1,1), (1,0), (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)] which is 6 segments. But I collected 6 apples, so initial length was 1 head + 6 body = 7 total? Actually, starting snake has no body? Wait, standard Snake: you start with a head and a tail (length 1). Each apple adds a segment. So with 6 apples, length should be 7: head + 6 body segments. Here, body list has 6 elements, so total 7.  \n\nNow, if I move, the tail should not move if I ate last turn? Actually, in this game, when you eat an apple, you grow by one, meaning that the tail does not drop for that move. So after moving to an apple, the next move the tail does not drop? Actually, the rule: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point\". So when you move onto an apple, you add a segment at the end (so the tail stays put). Then on the next move, you move the head and the tail moves? Typically, in Snake, after eating, the tail doesn't move for one step? But here, the movement is simultaneous. The description might imply that after eating, the body grows immediately, so the tail remains in place. So when I move next, the tail will not advance? Actually, it's standard: each turn, the head moves one cell, and if not eating an apple, the tail moves one cell (so length constant). If eating, the tail does not move (so length increases by one). So for this turn, since I ate last turn (moved to (3,1) with apple), my tail should not have moved. So the body should be the same as before, but with head at (3,1) and the tail still at (0,2). So when I move this turn, if I don't eat an apple, the tail will drop (so the last segment is removed). If I do eat an apple, the tail stays.  \n\nBut for safety checks, we only care about the head position after move.  \n\nBack to moves:  \n- RIGHT to (4,1): safe, no apple.  \n- UP to (3,2): safe, no apple (but adjacent to (2,2) apple).  \n- DOWN to (3,0): safe, no apple.  \n\nSo no immediate apple from any move.  \n\nWhich move gives better future options?  \n- UP to (3,2): puts me next to (2,2) apple. But Snake #1 is at (3,3) and might also go to (3,2) or (2,2). If I go UP, I risk head-on with Snake #1 if it goes DOWN.  \n- RIGHT to (4,1): moves me away from Snake #1, toward open space.  \n- DOWN to (3,0): safe but into a corner? (3,0) has neighbors: (2,0), (4,0), (3,1) but (3,1) is my body. So from (3,0), I can go LEFT to (2,0), RIGHT to (4,0), or UP to (3,1) (body). So only two safe moves? Actually, (2,0) is empty? Board shows (2,0) is \".\" so safe. (4,0) is \".\" safe. So two moves.  \n\nRIGHT to (4,1) has neighbors: (4,0), (4,2), (5,1), (3,1) (body). So three safe moves (excluding (3,1)).  \n\nSo RIGHT gives more options.  \n\nAlso, to avoid Snake #1, moving RIGHT is better.  \n\nLong-term, I want to collect apples. The apple at (2,2) is tempting, but risky due to Snake #1. Perhaps I can let Snake #1 take it and then avoid conflict? But if Snake #1 eats it, it grows to length 5 (currently 3 apples, so length 4? Head + 3 body = length 4). After eating, length 5.  \n\nAlternatively, I could go DOWN to (3,0) to be safe, but it doesn't help.  \n\nBest to go RIGHT to (4,1) to open up space and then later go for (8,4) or (9,2).  \n\n**END RATIONALE**  \n\n**Short-term plan:**  \nMove RIGHT to (4,1) to avoid potential collision with Snake #1 and gain maneuvering room. Next turn, from (4,1), consider moving UP to (4,2) to approach the eastern apples, or continue rightward. Monitor Snake #1's position to avoid head-on collisions.  \n\nRIGHT",

Its safe moves:  \nFrom (3,4), it can go LEFT (2,4) which is its body? Body: [(3,3), (2,3), (2,4)] \u2192 (2,4) is tail? Actually, body segments: (3,3) is directly behind head, (2,3) next, (2,4) tail. So LEFT to (2,4) is its own tail? But tail moves, so it might be safe? Rule: moving into your own body is deadly, but the tail might move away. However, since moves are simultaneous, we must consider the state before movement. (2,4) is currently occupied by Snake #1's body, so moving LEFT into (2,4) would be fatal. So LEFT is unsafe.  \nRIGHT to (4,4) is empty \u2192 safe.  \nDOWN to (3,3) is its body \u2192 unsafe.  \nUP to (3,5) is empty \u2192 safe.  \nSo Snake #1 can go RIGHT or UP.  \n\nIf Snake #1 goes RIGHT to (4,4), it will be closer to me. If it goes UP to (3,5), it moves toward (3,6) apple.  \n\nI want to avoid head-on collisions. My head is at (4,1), Snake #1 at (3,4). The Manhattan distance is |4-3| + |1-4| = 1+3=4, so no immediate collision risk this turn.  \n\nNow, evaluate my moves:  \n- RIGHT to (5,1): moves me toward eastern apples (8,4) and (9,2). Also, from (5,1), I can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT, which are likely safe (neighbors: (5,0), (5,2), (6,1)).  \n- UP to (4,2): moves me north, closer to (3,6) and (2,9). From (4,2), I can go LEFT (3,2) which is empty, RIGHT (5,2) empty, or UP (4,3) empty. Good options.  \n- DOWN to (4,0): moves me south. From (4,0), only LEFT (3,0) and RIGHT (5,0) are safe (UP is my body). So only two moves, which is limiting.  \n\nDOWN is less desirable due to limited options.  \n\nBetween RIGHT and UP:  \n- RIGHT: positions me for long-term eastward movement toward (8,4) and (9,2).  \n- UP: positions me for northward movement toward (3,6) and (2,9).  \n\nSnake #1 might go for (3,6) if it goes UP. If I go UP, I might compete for (3,6). However, (3,6) is 4 moves away (Manhattan distance from (4,1) is |4-3|+|1-6|=1+5=6? Actually, (4,1) to (3,6): dx=1, dy=5, total 6). So not immediate.  \n\nI should prefer moves that keep many options open. RIGHT to (5,1) gives 3 safe next moves, UP to (4,2) also gives 3, DOWN gives only 2. So avoid DOWN.  \n\nTo avoid potential future conflict with Snake #1, moving RIGHT (east) might be better, as Snake #1 is currently west/north of me.  \n\nAlso, note the apple at (2,2) is west, but my body blocks that direction for now.

From its head, it can move:  \nLEFT: (2,5) is empty? Board shows (2,5) as \".\" \u2192 safe.  \nRIGHT: (4,5) is empty \u2192 safe.  \nDOWN: (3,4) is its body \u2192 unsafe.  \nUP: (3,6) has an apple. Moving UP to (3,6) would eat the apple. So Snake #1 is likely to go UP to get the apple, unless it avoids for safety. But (3,6) is safe and desirable.  \n\nIf Snake #1 goes UP to (3,6), it eats the apple and grows to length 5. Its new head will be at (3,6).  \n\nI should avoid moving directly toward Snake #1 to prevent head-on collisions. Currently, Snake #1 is at (3,5), and I am at (5,1). Distance is |5-3| + |1-5| = 2+4=6, so no immediate danger.  \n\nEvaluate my moves:  \n- RIGHT to (6,1): moves me east. From there, I can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. This continues toward (8,4) and (9,2).  \n- UP to (5,2): moves me north. From (5,2), I can go LEFT (4,2), RIGHT (6,2), or UP (5,3). All are currently empty. This moves me closer to (3,6) and (2,9), but note Snake #1 might be at (3,6) next turn.  \n- DOWN to (5,0): moves me south. From (5,0), I can go LEFT (4,0) or RIGHT (6,0). UP (5,1) is my body. So only two options. Less desirable.  \n\nDOWN limits future options. So avoid DOWN.  \n\nBetween RIGHT and UP:  \n- RIGHT (east) is away from Snake #1 and toward apples.  \n- UP (north) might bring me closer to Snake #1 if it goes to (3,6). However, from (5,2) to (3,6) is |5-3|+|2-6|=2+4=6, so not too close.  \n\nBut Snake #1 might also move RIGHT to (4,5) or LEFT to (2,5). If it goes RIGHT to (4,5), it is closer to me? |5-4|+|1-5|=1+4=5. Still safe.  \n\nGiven that I have more apples (6 vs 3), I should play safe and avoid potential conflicts. Moving RIGHT seems safer as it goes away from Snake #1. Also, the eastern apples (9,2) and (8,4) are available.  \n\nMoreover, after RIGHT to (6,1), my next moves will be open, and I can plan to go UP to (6,2) then to (8,4).  \n\nSo choose RIGHT.  \n\n**END RATIONALE**  \n\n**Short-term plan:**  \nMove RIGHT to (6,1) to continue eastward toward apples (8,4) and (9,2). This keeps distance from Snake #1. Next turn, consider moving UP to (6,2) to approach (8,4) or continue RIGHT to (7,1). Monitor Snake #1's movement\u2014if it eats (3,6), it grows and might become more aggressive.  \n\nRIGHT",

Apples: (9,2), (8,4), (2,2), (2,9), (4,4). Snake #1 is at head (4,6) with body [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3)] (length 5).  \n\nCheck safe moves from (7,1):  \n- LEFT: (6,1) is my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT: (8,1) is empty (board shows \".\") \u2192 safe.  \n- UP: (7,2) is empty (board shows \".\") \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN: (7,0) is empty (board shows \".\") \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: RIGHT, UP, DOWN.  \n\nAnalyze apples:  \n- (9,2) is close: |7-9| + |1-2| = 3 units away.  \n- (8,4) is also close: |7-8| + |1-4| = 1+3=4 units away.  \n- Other apples are farther or might be contested by Snake #1 (e.g., (4,4)).  \n\nSnake #1 at (4,6) might target (4,4) (only 2 units away) or (2,9). It has safe moves: LEFT (3,6) is its body? Wait, from (4,6), moves:  \n- LEFT: (3,6) is its body? Actually, Snake #1's body is [(3,6), (3,5), ...], so (3,6) is its neck \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT: (5,6) is empty? Board shows \".\" at (5,6)? Actually, board has \"T\" at (3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3) for Snake #1, so (5,6) should be free.  \n- UP: (4,7) is empty.  \n- DOWN: (4,5) is empty? But (3,5) is body, so (4,5) is safe.  \n\nSo Snake #1 can move RIGHT, UP, or DOWN. It might go toward (4,4) via DOWN to (4,5) then LEFT? Or RIGHT to (5,6) then down? But (4,4) is adjacent to (4,5) and (3,4). Since Snake #1 is at (4,6), it can go DOWN to (4,5), then next turn to (4,4). So it is very close to (4,4).  \n\nTherefore, I should avoid (4,4) and focus on (9,2) and (8,4), which are safer.  \n\nFrom (7,1):  \n- RIGHT to (8,1): moves closer to (9,2) and (8,4). From (8,1), I can go UP to (8,2) (toward (9,2)) or RIGHT to (9,1).  \n- UP to (7,2): moves toward (8,4) and (9,2). From (7,2), I can go RIGHT to (8,2) or UP to (7,3).  \n- DOWN to (7,0): moves south, away from apples. Limited options: only LEFT (6,0) or RIGHT (8,0), both of which are dead-ends long-term.  \n\nDOWN is bad. Between RIGHT and UP:  \n- RIGHT: direct path to (9,2) via (8,1) -> (9,1) -> (9,2) or (8,1) -> (8,2) -> (9,2).  \n- UP: (7,2) -> (7,3) -> ... to (8,4) is longer.  \n\nRIGHT is more efficient for (9,2). Also, after RIGHT, I have more open space to maneuver (east side has fewer obstacles).  \n\nAlso, Snake #1 is far away (|7-4| + |1-6| = 3+5=8), so no immediate threat.  \n\nChoose RIGHT to (8,1).  \n\n**END RATIONALE**  \n\n**Short-term plan:**  \nMove RIGHT to (8,1) to approach apple (9,2). Next turn, consider going UP to (8,2) to get closer to (9,2) or (8,4). Avoid Snake #1, which is likely to take (4,4) soon.  \n\nRIGHT",

This is the goal from my previous move. I grow longer, which is good, but I need to make sure my next move from (9,2) is safe. I'll check that after getting the apple.\n- **DOWN**: Moves me to (9,0).

This puts me in a good position to grab the apple at (2, 2) or (0, 3).

I just ate the apple at (9,2), so my length is now 7.\n\nFirst, check which moves are safe from (9, 2):\n- **LEFT**: (8, 2) - Board shows this as empty (.), and it's not part of my body or Snake #1's body. **SAFE**.\n- **RIGHT**: (10, 2) - Off the board (x=10). **UNSAFE**.\n- **UP**: (9, 3) - Board shows this as empty (.). **SAFE**.\n- **DOWN**: (9, 1) - This is my own body. **UNSAFE**.\n\nSo safe moves: LEFT, UP.\n\nNow evaluate each safe option:\n\n**LEFT to (8, 2):**\n- This moves me closer to the apple at (8, 4). The path is clear: (8,2) -> (8,3) -> (8,4). I should avoid moving directly into my own body in future moves, but from (8,2), I can go UP to (8,3) next.\n- It also moves me away from the top-right corner, which is good for having more options.\n- The distance to (8,4) is |8-8| + |2-4| = 2.\n\n**UP to (9, 3):**\n- This moves me to the top row. From (9,3), my next moves could only be LEFT (8,3) or DOWN (9,2) (which is my body). So UP would put me in a corner with only one safe move next (LEFT). That is very risky.\n- There are no apples directly above (9,3). The nearest apple is (8,4), which is not directly accessible from (9,3) without going through (8,3) first.\n- This seems like a dead-end move that traps me.\n\nComparing the two:\n- UP leads to a trap with only one exit next turn.\n- LEFT gives me more options: from (8,2), I can go UP (to (8,3)) or LEFT (to (7,2)) or DOWN (to (8,1) which is my body, so not safe). So two safe moves from (8,2).\n- LEFT also moves me towards the apple at (8,4), which is a high-priority target.\n\nConsider Snake #1:\n- Its head is at (4,3). It is far away (distance |9-4| + |2-3| = 5+1=6). No immediate threat.\n- It is currently moving around its own area. It might be heading for the apple at (2,2) or (4,0), but that doesn't affect my immediate move.\n\nOther apples:\n- (2,2), (2,9), (4,0) are all far. After (8,4), I can plan to go for (4,0) or (2,2).\n\nShort-term plan:\nGo LEFT to (8,2) this turn. Next turn, go UP to (8,3) to get closer to the apple at (8,4). Then eat it on the following turn. Avoid going UP to (9,3) as it traps me.\n\nLEFT",

The board shows this as empty (.). **SAFE**.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nEvaluate options:\n\n**UP to (8, 4):**\n- This immediately eats the apple, giving me my 8th apple and growing my body by one segment.\n- After eating, my head will be at (8,4) and my body will be [(8,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,1), (8,1), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1)].\n- This achieves my immediate goal and puts me in a strong position with a longer body.\n\n**LEFT to (7, 3):**\n- This moves me away from the apple and provides no immediate benefit.\n- From (7,3), I could then move towards other apples like (4,0) or (2,2), but this is less efficient.\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 3):**\n- This also moves me away from the apple and towards the edge of the board.\n- From (9,3), my options would be limited (only LEFT and UP/DOWN depending on my body).\n\nConsider Snake #1:\n- Its head is at (2,3). It is far away (Manhattan distance of |8-2| + |3-3| = 6). No immediate threat.\n- It might be heading for the apple at (2,2) or (2,9).\n\nConclusion:\nUP is the clear and optimal choice. It allows me to safely eat the apple at (8,4), increasing my score and growing my snake. This aligns perfectly with my plan from last turn.\n\nPlan for next turns:\nAfter eating the apple at (8,4), reassess the board. The closest apples will likely be (4,0) or (2,2). I should plan a safe route to the next target while avoiding potential conflicts with Snake #1. My increased length gives me an advantage in blocking the enemy.\n\nUP",

The closest apple in that direction is at (2,9), which is very far.\n- From (7,5), future moves would be UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (RIGHT is (8,5) which is empty). Gives options.\n\n**DOWN to (7, 3):**\n- Moves me towards the apple at (2,6) and (3,1).

Excellent options.\n\n**LEFT to (6, 4):**\n- Moves me west, towards the cluster of apples.\n- From (6,4), future moves would be UP, DOWN, LEFT. RIGHT would be back to my head's current position (7,4), which will be empty next turn. Also good options.\n\nConsider Enemy Snake #1:\n- Head at (2,1). It is currently on a path that could go for the apple at (3,1) immediately. If it moves DOWN, it dies (off board). If it moves LEFT, it dies (off board). If it moves UP, it goes to (2,2) which is its own body. So its only safe move is RIGHT to (3,1) to eat the apple there.\n- This means Snake #1 will almost certainly move RIGHT and eat the apple at (3,1) this turn, growing to length 7.\n- After eating, its head will be at (3,1) and its body will extend backwards. Its new tail will be at (4,5) or similar.\n\nLong-Term Strategy:\nThe apple at (3,1) will be gone next turn. My best targets are now (2,6), (4,0), and (0,3). Moving DOWN puts me on the most direct path towards (2,6) and (4,0). Moving LEFT also helps, but DOWN is more aggressive towards the apples.\n\nMoving DOWN to (7,3) gives me the most flexibility and puts me closest to the remaining apples. It also avoids the area where Snake #1 will be (it will be at (3,1) and facing east, likely moving towards (4,1) or up/down from there).\n\nConclusion:\nDOWN is the best choice. It's safe, moves me directly towards the highest concentration of apples, and gives me excellent future options.\n\nPlan for next turns:\nHead south and west towards (4,0) and (2,6). The apple at (2,6) is my primary target. Be aware that Snake #1 will be growing and may also be heading towards (2,6) or (4,0). Plan a route that avoids potential conflicts.\n\nDOWN",

The cell directly behind my head (tail direction) is (7,4).\n\nCheck safe moves from (7,3):\n- **UP**: (7, 4). This is my own body segment. **UNSAFE**.\n- **DOWN**: (7, 2). The board shows this empty (.). Looks safe.\n- **LEFT**: (6, 3). The board shows this empty (.). Looks safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (8, 3). This is my own body segment. **UNSAFE**.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT.\n\nEvaluate options:\n\n**DOWN to (7, 2):**\n- Moves me south.\n- From (7,2), future moves would be DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (UP is body, RIGHT is (8,2) which is body). So moves would be DOWN to (7,1) (body? Wait, check: My tail was at (6,1) last turn. After I move, my tail moves forward, so (7,1) becomes my second-to-last segment? Let's project the body movement.\n    - After I move DOWN to (7,2), my body becomes: New head at (7,2). Then the old head (7,3) becomes the new neck. Then the rest of the body follows: (7,4), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,1), (8,1). The tail segment (7,1) is gone because we didn't eat an apple.\n    - So the new body will be: [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,1)].\n    - Therefore, from (7,2):\n        - UP to (7,3) is body (new neck).\n        - DOWN to (7,1) is empty.\n        - LEFT to (6,2) is empty.\n        - RIGHT to (8,2) is body.\n    - So future safe moves from (7,2) would be DOWN and LEFT. A bit limited.\n\n**LEFT to (6, 3):**\n- Moves me west, towards the apples at (2,6), (0,3), and (4,0).\n- From (6,3), future moves: Let's project the body.\n    - New head at (6,3). New body: [(6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,1)].\n    - From (6,3):\n        - UP to (6,4) is empty.\n        - DOWN to (6,2) is empty.\n        - LEFT to (5,3) is empty.\n        - RIGHT to (7,3) is body (new neck).\n    - So future safe moves from (6,3) would be UP, DOWN, LEFT. Three options. Excellent flexibility.\n\nEnemy Snake #1:\n- Last turn, its head was at (3,1) and it likely moved RIGHT to eat the apple at (3,1)? Wait, the apple was at (3,1) and the snake's head was at (2,1). It would have moved to (3,1) to eat the apple, growing to length 8 (7 apples + 1 new = 8).\n- Its new head is at (3,1). Its body will now be 8 segments long: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)].\n- This turn, from (3,1), its possible moves:\n    - UP to (3,2): Empty? Board shows (.) at (3,2). Safe.\n    - DOWN to (3,0): Empty. Safe.\n    - LEFT to (2,1): Its own body. UNSAFE.\n    - RIGHT to (4,1): Empty. Safe.\n- It will likely go for the nearest apple, which is at (4,0) (DOWN-RIGHT) or (2,6) (UP-LEFT). Moving LEFT is unsafe, so it will choose UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. RIGHT to (4,1) puts it closer to the apple at (4,0). UP to (3,2) starts a path towards (2,6). It's a toss-up.\n\nMy Strategy:\nLEFT gives me better future options and directly moves me towards the cluster of apples (0,3), (2,6), (4,0). DOWN leads to a more confined space with fewer immediate options. Therefore, LEFT is the superior move for maintaining flexibility and pursuing apples.\n\nPlan for next turns:\nHead west towards the apple cluster. The apple at (2,6) is a primary target, but (4,0) is also close. Be aware that Snake #1 is also likely heading for these apples. My path west (LEFT) keeps me safely distant from its probable path south/east from (3,1). I will aim to loop around and collect apples while avoiding a head-on collision.\n\nLEFT",

This means it will grow to length 9 and its body will extend.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN towards (4,0) would put me on a collision course with the enemy snake, which is dangerous. Moving LEFT is the safest and most flexible option, keeping me in the center and allowing me to pivot towards any apple next turn.\n\nPlan for next turns:\nContinue heading west to (5,3), then assess. The apple at (0,3) is a long-term goal, but the one at (2,6) is also viable. Avoid the south where the enemy is. Be prepared to go north or west next turn to collect apples and avoid the enemy's path.\n\nLEFT",

Safe. This puts me closer to the apple at (5, 1).\n    - **DOWN**: (4, -1). **INVALID** (Off-board).\n    - **LEFT**: (3, 0). **INVALID** (Backwards into body).\n    - **RIGHT**: (5, 0). Safe coordinate.\n\n2. **Targeting Apples**:\n    - **(5, 1)** is the closest apple. \n    - From (4, 0), moving **UP** to (4, 1) puts me 1 step away from (5, 1).\n    - From (4, 0), moving **RIGHT** to (5, 0) also puts me 1 step away from (5, 1).\n\n3. **Enemy Threat**:\n    - Snake #0 is at (5, 3). It could reach (5, 1) in 2 turns: (5, 3) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 1).\n    - If I move **UP** to (4, 1), I can reach (5, 1) next turn by moving RIGHT. \n    - If I move **RIGHT** to (5, 0), I can reach (5, 1) next turn by moving UP.\n    - If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (5, 2) this turn, and I move to (4, 1) or (5, 0), we will both be adjacent to apple (5, 1) next turn. \n    - However, if I move RIGHT to (5, 0), and Snake #0 moves DOWN to (5, 2), and then next turn we both try to move to (5, 1), we would collide at (5, 1).\n    - Moving UP to (4, 1) is slightly safer for positioning because it keeps me away from the wall and provides more escape routes if the enemy tries to cut me off.\n\n4. **Safety**:\n    - UP to (4, 1) is safe. My tail at (4, 4) will move to (4, 3) and my body will follow. I have plenty of room to the right and above.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (4, 1). Then move towards the apple at (5, 1). Be wary of Snake #0's head position at (5, 3) as it might also target the same apple.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n- **DOWN (5, 2)**: The board shows this as empty (.). Safe.\n- **LEFT (4, 3)**: The board shows this as empty (.). Safe.\n- **RIGHT (6, 3)**: This is my own body segment (the neck). **UNSAFE**.\n\nAll moves except RIGHT are safe: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nAnalyze the board and enemy movement:\n\nEnemy Snake #1 is at (4, 0). The apple at (5, 1) is one step away from me if I go DOWN to (5, 2). However, Snake #1 is also close to (5,1). It's unlikely it can reach (5,1) this turn because its head is at (4,0). Its safe moves are likely UP (4,1) or LEFT (3,0). (4,1) is empty, so it will probably go UP towards the apple at (5,1). If it goes UP, it will be at (4,1) next turn.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (5,2), I can contest the apple next turn. But if the enemy goes to (4,1), then we are adjacent to the same apple. This could lead to a head-on collision risk if we both try for it on the following turn.\n\nThe safest long-term play is to avoid immediate confrontation. Moving LEFT to (4,3) takes me towards the apple at (0,3) and away from the enemy. It also opens up future paths north or south along the left side of the board.\n\nMoving UP to (5,4) heads towards the apple at (2,6) and keeps me centralized.\n\nGiven that the enemy is likely moving UP and will be contesting the southern apples, the best move is to avoid that area and secure the apples on the left and top.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Secure the western apples. Head towards (0,3) first, then loop north towards (1,8) and (2,9). This path keeps me away from the enemy's probable trajectory.\n\nLEFT",
