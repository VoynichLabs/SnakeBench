The nearest apple is at (4,3) (Manhattan distance 2). LEFT and UP both move us to distance 1 from that apple. LEFT is chosen because it moves directly toward the cluster of nearby apples at (4,3) and (4,4) and keeps multiple escape options open for subsequent turns.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move LEFT now to (4,2), then UP next turn to eat (4,3). After that, aim for (4,4) or other nearby apples while avoiding getting boxed in.\n\nLEFT",
