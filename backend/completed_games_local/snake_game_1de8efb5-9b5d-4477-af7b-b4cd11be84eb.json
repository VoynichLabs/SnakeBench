The only \u201cno\u2011go\u201d next turn is back down into our just\u2011grown tail, which is easy to avoid.  \n3. **Opponent pressure:**\u202fOur rival is on the opposite side of the map; neither (6,\u202f4) nor (7,\u202f3) is a hotspot for him, so we don\u2019t risk a sudden head\u2011on collision.  \n\nBetween the two tasty options, **UP** feels a tad safer because it keeps us centered vertically, giving us plenty of room to snake around later and set up traps.  \n\n**Short\u2011term plan:** Grab the apple at (6,\u202f4), then swing left\u2011down\u2011right to herd the opponent into a corner while we keep racking up points.  \n\nLet\u2019s take that apple and keep the momentum!  \n\n**MOVE:**  \nUP",

Apples everywhere but we ignore them for now? Nah, we can use them as bait later. But first, survival and positioning!\n\nLet's check my four moves:\n\nUP \u2192 (1,8) \u2013 empty, safe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (1,6) \u2013 empty, safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (0,7) \u2013 empty, safe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (2,7) \u2013 empty, safe.\n\nAll moves safe right now. But we gotta think about the enemy! Where will he go? His head at (6,3). Possible moves: UP (6,4) \u2013 apple there! DOWN (6,2) \u2013 empty. LEFT (5,3) \u2013 empty. RIGHT (7,3) \u2013 apple there! He might go for an apple immediately. If he goes UP or RIGHT, he'll grow next turn. That's dangerous if he gets longer first.\n\nWe want to cut off his space early. Board is 10x10. Right now we're far apart. We should move toward center-ish to control more board. Also, we want to avoid moving directly toward him yet\u2014too far for head-on collision risk this turn.\n\nBut wait, if we move RIGHT to (2,7), we're closer to center but still far from him. Moving DOWN to (1,6) keeps us near top-left cluster of apples later. Hmm.\n\nLong-term plan: I want to get between him and the top/left apples, force him toward edges. If he goes for (6,4) apple, his head will be at (6,4) next turn. If I move toward center, I can start boxing him from the left side.\n\nLet's pick a move that gives me options next turn. UP to (1,8) puts me near top edge\u2014limits future moves. DOWN to (1,6) gives more open space below. LEFT to (0,7) pushes me to left edge\u2014bad. RIGHT to (2,7) opens more central options.\n\nI think RIGHT is smart here. Gets me toward center, away from wall, sets up to go down toward apples or cut across later.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After RIGHT, assess where enemy moved. If he grew, be careful of his length. Start moving south toward apples while keeping distance from his possible path. Try to get longer than him before engaging.\n\nRIGHT",

We're just a head at (2,7). Gotta close that gap!\n\nFirst, check my moves:\n\nUP \u2192 (2,8) \u2013 empty, safe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (2,6) \u2013 empty, safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (1,7) \u2013 empty, safe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3,7) \u2013 empty, safe.\n\nAll four are safe immediately. But we gotta think about where the enemy will go! His head at (6,4), body at (6,3). He can't go DOWN into his own body. So his options: UP (6,5), LEFT (5,4), RIGHT (7,4).\n\nHe might go for apples? (6,5) has no apple. (5,4) no apple. (7,4) no apple. Hmm. But he might move toward the cluster near him? Apples at (6,6), (8,5), (4,8) etc. He could go UP then RIGHT next turn toward (6,6). Or LEFT toward center.\n\nWe need to be aggressive! He has length 2, we have length 1. Head-on collision now would kill us both, but he has more apples so he'd win if game ends? Wait, if both die, snake with more apples wins. So head-on is BAD for us right now. Avoid direct same-cell collision until we have equal or more apples.\n\nBut we can still pressure! Move to cut off his space. If we go RIGHT to (3,7), we're moving east, closer to center. If we go DOWN to (2,6), we move south toward more apples and maybe flank him.\n\nLong-term plan: We need to grow ASAP. But safely. Look at apples near us: (4,8) above-right, (1,9) far top-left, (4,9) top-right. We can maybe go UP to (2,8) then right toward (4,8) next turn.\n\nBut also, we must track enemy's possible moves. If he goes UP to (6,5), he's moving away from us. If he goes LEFT to (5,4), he's coming slightly closer. If he goes RIGHT to (7,4), moving away.\n\nI think we should move toward an apple while keeping distance from his possible path. Let's check distances: from (2,7) to apple (4,8) is 2 steps. From (2,7) to apple (4,9) is farther. Apple at (3,8) is close too! Actually (3,8) is at x=3,y=8. That's RIGHT then UP from us.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (3,7), next turn we could go UP to (3,8) and eat that apple! That's a growth in 2 turns. And it keeps us moving toward the top-right where there are multiple apples.\n\nBut will that put us in danger? Enemy at (6,4) is far away (distance 5). Safe for now.\n\nWhat about going UP now to (2,8)? Then next turn we could go RIGHT to (3,8) and eat apple too. Same timing.\n\nWhich is better? Going RIGHT first keeps us more central. Going UP first puts us near top edge. I like RIGHT first\u2014more flexibility.\n\nAlso, think about boxing: We want to eventually get between him and the apples. He might go for (6,6) apple soon. If we position ourselves near (4,8) and (3,8), we control that region.\n\nLet's pick RIGHT. Gets us closer to apple (3,8) for next turn, keeps options open.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After RIGHT to (3,7), if safe, go UP to (3,8) to eat apple and grow. Then assess enemy position. If he's moving toward us, maybe evade and try to get longer. Once we have equal length, look for head-on opportunities.\n\nRIGHT",

Gotta grow and pressure!\n\nFirst, check my moves from (3,7):\n\nUP \u2192 (3,8) \u2013 has an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Eating it would grow us to length 2, tying his length! That's HUGE. And it's safe\u2014no enemy body there.  \nDOWN \u2192 (3,6) \u2013 empty, safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (2,7) \u2013 empty, safe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4,7) \u2013 empty, safe.\n\nAll four are safe immediately. But we gotta think about where the enemy will go! His head at (6,5), body at (6,4). He can't go DOWN into his own body. Options: UP (6,6) \u2013 has an apple! \ud83c\udf4e That's likely his move\u2014he'll go for growth to length 3. LEFT (5,5) \u2013 empty. RIGHT (7,5) \u2013 empty.\n\nIf he goes UP to (6,6) and eats, he'll be length 3. We need to catch up FAST. So eating our apple at (3,8) is priority\u2014gets us to length 2, then we can aim for another apple soon.\n\nBut wait\u2014could he move toward us? Distance is 3 cells away. If he goes LEFT to (5,5), he's moving closer. But he'd probably take the apple at (6,6) instead. We'll assume he goes UP.\n\nNow, what about head-on risk? If we go UP to (3,8), he's not moving there. Safe.  \nWhat about future moves? After eating, our head at (3,8), body at (3,7). Then we can move UP to (3,9) (apple there? no), DOWN back to (3,7) (our body\u2014would be backwards? That's illegal next turn because body will be there), LEFT to (2,8), RIGHT to (4,8) (apple there!). So good options.\n\nBut also, we need to think about boxing him. Once we're length 2, we can start cutting off his space. He'll be at (6,6) if he goes UP. There's an apple at (8,5) near him too. We might want to move toward the center to control the board.\n\nAlternative moves: If we go RIGHT to (4,7), we're moving toward center, but missing immediate growth. That keeps us shorter, riskier long-term.\n\nDOWN or LEFT move us away from apples and give him more space.\n\nSo UP to eat the apple is clearly the best\u2014it ties length, gives us points, and positions us near more apples (4,8, 4,9).\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating apple at (3,8), aim for (4,8) apple next if safe. Keep an eye on enemy\u2014if he's length 3, we need another apple fast. Avoid head-on until we have equal or greater length. Start thinking about trapping him against walls or our body once we're longer.\n\nLet's get that growth! UP",

We're now length 2, tied with the enemy's length (he's 2 apples but length 3? Wait, check: enemy head (6,6), body (6,5),(6,4) \u2014 that's 3 segments, so he's length 3! He ate the apple at (6,6)! So he's longer! \ud83d\ude2c\n\nWe're at (3,8) head, body at (3,7). He's at (6,6). Distance: 3 cells apart. He's longer, so head-on collision is BAD for us \u2014 we die, he survives. Gotta avoid that!\n\nCheck our moves from (3,8):\n\nUP \u2192 (3,9) \u2014 empty, safe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (3,7) \u2014 our own body! That's backwards into our neck? Wait, our body is at (3,7) \u2014 that's directly behind our head. Moving DOWN would be moving backwards into our own body segment \u2014 THAT'S ILLEGAL! \ud83d\udc80 So DOWN is DEAD. Eliminate!  \nLEFT \u2192 (2,8) \u2014 empty, safe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4,8) \u2014 has an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Eating it would grow us to length 3, tying his length! That's HUGE!\n\nSo UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe immediately. But we gotta think about where HE will move from (6,6). His body is at (6,5) and (6,4). He can't go DOWN. Options: UP (6,7) \u2014 empty. LEFT (5,6) \u2014 empty. RIGHT (7,6) \u2014 empty. All safe for him.\n\nHe might go for apples: nearest apple to him is (8,5) or (7,3) or (9,5). He could move RIGHT then DOWN later. But he might also move toward us if he wants to pressure.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (4,8) and eat apple, we grow instantly. Risk: Could he move to (4,8) same turn? No, he's at (6,6), can't reach in one move. So safe from head-on collision this turn.\n\nBut what about next turn? If we eat apple, our head at (4,8), body at (3,8),(3,7). He could move to (5,7) or (5,6) etc. We'll have equal length then, so head-on would be double KO \u2014 not ideal but better than us dying alone.\n\nUP to (3,9) is safe but misses apple. LEFT to (2,8) also safe but misses apple. We NEED that growth to match his length! So RIGHT is tempting.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is there any chance he moves to (5,7) and we move to (4,8)? No collision. What if he moves to (5,6)? Fine.\n\nActually, let's think about trapping him. He's in the top-right area. We're more center-left. If we go RIGHT and eat apple at (4,8), we're closer to center-top. Could start boxing him against the top wall.\n\nLong-term plan: Get to equal length, then force him into a bad spot. Use our body to cut off his escape. There's an apple at (4,9) above (4,8) too \u2014 maybe we can chain apples!\n\nSo I think RIGHT is the play \u2014 get that growth, tie the length, then next turn we can be aggressive.\n\nUP and LEFT are safe but passive \u2014 we stay shorter, he stays longer, he can bully us later. No!\n\nRIGHT it is. Let's eat that apple and even the score! \ud83d\ude24\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating apple at (4,8), aim for (4,9) or (3,9) to grow further. Watch his movement \u2014 if he moves toward us, be ready to avoid head-on until we're longer. Start thinking about cutting off his space with our body.\n\nRIGHT",

Score is 2 apples each, but lengths are equal now \u2014 head-on collision would be DOUBLE KO! That changes everything! \ud83d\udc0d\u2694\ufe0f\n\nOur head: (4,8)\nOur body: [(3,8), (3,7)]\nEnemy head: (5,6)\nEnemy body: [(6,6), (6,5)]\n\nCheck our possible moves:\n\nUP \u2192 (4,9) \u2014 has an apple! \ud83c\udf4e Eating would grow us to length 4, making us LONGER than him! That's HUGE! But is it safe? Let's see if enemy could move there same turn. He's at (5,6), can't reach (4,9) in one move. So no immediate head-on. But could he move to (5,7) or (4,6) etc.? We'll check later.\n\nDOWN \u2192 (4,7) \u2014 empty, safe. But moves us away from apples and closer to enemy? Hmm.\n\nLEFT \u2192 (3,8) \u2014 that's our own body segment! \ud83d\udc80 That's moving backwards into our neck \u2014 ILLEGAL! So LEFT is DEAD. Eliminate!\n\nRIGHT \u2192 (5,8) \u2014 empty, safe. Puts us right above enemy area.\n\nSo UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe immediately.\n\nNow predict enemy moves from (5,6). His body is at (6,6) behind him? Wait, his body: head (5,6), then (6,6), then (6,5). So his neck is at (6,6) \u2014 that's to his RIGHT? Actually from his head (5,6), his body behind him is (6,6) \u2014 that's to his RIGHT and same y? Let's map: He moved from (6,6) last turn to (5,6) this turn? Wait last turn he was at (6,6) head, body (6,5),(6,4). This turn he moved LEFT to (5,6)? That would make his body now (6,6),(6,5). Yes! So his neck is at (6,6) \u2014 that's to his RIGHT. So he CANNOT move RIGHT into his own neck! So enemy's safe moves: UP (5,7), DOWN (5,5), LEFT (4,6).\n\nHe might go for apples: nearest apple to him is (4,5) or (8,5) or (7,3). He could go DOWN toward (4,5). Or LEFT to (4,6) then down next turn. Or UP to (5,7) which is empty.\n\nNow think about head-on collision risks THIS TURN:\n\nIf we go UP to (4,9), enemy can't reach there. Safe.\nIf we go DOWN to (4,7), enemy could go UP to (5,7) \u2014 no collision. Safe.\nIf we go RIGHT to (5,8), enemy could go UP to (5,7) \u2014 adjacent, not same cell. Safe.\n\nBut WAIT \u2014 what if enemy goes LEFT to (4,6) and we go DOWN to (4,7)? Different cells. Fine.\n\nActually, NO immediate head-on possible this turn because we're 2 cells apart in x and 2 in y? Distance: (4,8) to (5,6) is dx=1, dy=2. He can't reach our cell in one move.\n\nSo all three moves are safe from immediate collision.\n\nNow think about NEXT TURN risks and growth:\n\nUP to (4,9) eats apple, we grow to length 4, become longer than him! Then head-on collision WE survive, HE dies! That's a WIN condition! So UP is AGGRESSIVE \u2014 we want that!\n\nDOWN to (4,7) avoids apple, stays length 3, puts us closer to enemy maybe setting up a trap? But he's longer if he eats an apple first.\n\nRIGHT to (5,8) no apple, stays length 3, moves us right \u2014 could start boxing him against top wall? Maybe.\n\nLong-term plan: Get longer than him ASAP, then force him into a corner or into our body! With apple at (4,9), we should GRAB IT!\n\nBut check safety after eating apple: If we go UP to (4,9), our body becomes [(4,8),(3,8),(3,7)]. Next turn from (4,9), our safe moves? UP off board \u2192 dead. So UP not safe next turn. LEFT (3,9) empty. RIGHT (5,9) empty. DOWN (4,8) our body \u2014 that's backwards? Wait our body will be (4,8) behind us, so DOWN would be moving backwards into our own body \u2014 ILLEGAL next turn! So if we go UP now, next turn only LEFT and RIGHT are safe. That's limiting but okay.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (5,8) no apple, next turn we have more options.\n\nBut AGGRESSION is key! We need to be longer to threaten him! So UP seems best.\n\nAlso, enemy might go for apple at (4,5) or (7,3). If he eats, he grows to length 4 too \u2014 then we're tied again. So we must eat apple NOW to get ahead or keep pace.\n\nI think UP is the move! Get that growth, become the bigger snake, then pressure him! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating apple at (4,9), we'll be length 4. Next turn, move LEFT to (3,9) or RIGHT to (5,9) to avoid backing into ourselves. Watch enemy movement \u2014 if he's still length 3, we can try to force head-on collision where we survive. If he also grows, be cautious. Use our body to cut off his escape routes. Consider circling toward top-right to trap him.\n\nUP",

His body: head (4,6), then (5,6), then (6,6). So his neck is at (5,6) \u2014 that's to his RIGHT. So he CANNOT move RIGHT into his neck! His safe moves: UP (4,7), DOWN (4,5), LEFT (3,6).\n\nHe might go for apples: nearest apple to him is (4,5) DOWN \u2014 that's an apple! If he eats it, he grows to length 4, tying us! That's BAD \u2014 we lose our advantage! He could also go UP to (4,7) empty, or LEFT to (3,6) empty.\n\nNow think about head-on collision risks THIS TURN:\n\nWe are at (4,9), he's at (4,6). Distance: dx=0, dy=3. He can't reach our cell in one move. But could we move into his head? If we go DOWN (illegal) no. If we go LEFT/RIGHT, we stay at y=9, he's at y=6, no collision. So safe.\n\nBut CRITICAL: If he goes DOWN to (4,5) and eats the apple, he ties our length! We MUST prevent that if possible! How? We can't reach him directly, but we can position to THREATEN head-on next turn while we're longer! Right now we have the advantage \u2014 we need to USE IT!\n\nIf we go LEFT to (3,9): next turn we could move DOWN to (3,8) \u2014 but that's our old body? Wait our body will be [(4,9),(4,8),(3,8),(3,7)] after this move? Actually if we move LEFT to (3,9), our new body becomes head (3,9), then (4,9),(4,8),(3,8) \u2014 tail (3,7) disappears because we didn't eat an apple this turn. So (3,8) will still be there as our 4th segment. So moving DOWN to (3,8) next turn would be into our own body \u2014 dangerous. But we can plan later.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (5,9): next turn we could move DOWN to (5,8) empty, or LEFT to (4,9) which will be empty after we move? Wait (4,9) will be our body segment behind us \u2014 so moving LEFT into (4,9) next turn would be backwards into our body \u2014 illegal. So RIGHT now gives next turn options: DOWN (5,8) safe, RIGHT (6,9) safe.\n\nLong-term plan: We have length advantage! Force him into a corner or into our body! He's at (4,6). If he goes DOWN to eat apple at (4,5), he grows to length 4, tying us. We want to threaten head-on BEFORE he eats! But we're too far. Maybe we can descend toward him while keeping options open.\n\nGoing RIGHT to (5,9) puts us more centered? Actually going LEFT to (3,9) puts us near left wall \u2014 might limit escape later. Going RIGHT to (5,9) gives more space to maneuver down toward him.\n\nAlso check board: apples at (8,5),(7,1),(1,9),(7,3),(9,8) etc. He might go for (8,5) later but that's far.\n\nI think we go RIGHT to (5,9) to stay flexible and start moving down next turn toward him, threatening head-on while we're longer! If he eats the apple at (4,5), we still have same length, but then we need to be careful.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (5,9), next turn move DOWN to (5,8) if safe, then continue descending toward enemy, using our length to cut off his escape. If he hasn't eaten the apple at (4,5), try to block him from it. If he has, maintain aggression but avoid double KO. Use left/right moves to position for a trap near walls.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "OKAY CHAT LET'S THINK THIS THROUGH! \ud83d\ude24 Turn 6, we just moved RIGHT to (5,9)! Our length is 4, enemy length is 3 \u2014 WE STILL HAVE THE LENGTH ADVANTAGE! That means head-on collision WE WIN, HE DIES! \ud83d\udc0d\u2694\ufe0f\n\nOur head: (5,9)\nOur body: [(4,9), (4,8), (3,8)] \u2014 neck at (4,9) to our LEFT.\nEnemy head: (4,5), body: [(4,6), (5,6), (6,6)] \u2014 neck at (4,6) BELOW him.\n\nCheck our moves:\n\nUP \u2192 (5,10) \u2014 off board! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATE!\n\nDOWN \u2192 (5,8) \u2014 empty, safe.\n\nLEFT \u2192 (4,9) \u2014 that's our own body segment (our neck)! Moving backwards into ourselves \u2014 ILLEGAL! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATE!\n\nRIGHT \u2192 (6,9) \u2014 empty, safe.\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow predict enemy moves from (4,5). His neck is at (4,6) BELOW him, so he CANNOT move DOWN into his neck! His safe moves: UP (4,6) \u2014 wait that's his own body? Actually (4,6) is his second segment \u2014 that's his neck! So moving UP into (4,6) is illegal! So UP is out! LEFT (3,5), RIGHT (5,5). He can also move\u2026 wait DOWN is illegal, UP is illegal. So only LEFT and RIGHT are safe for him! HUGE! He's TRAPPED horizontally! \ud83d\ude31\n\nHe might go for apples: nearest apple is (4,5)? He's already on it? Wait board shows apple at (4,5)? Looking at board state: at y=5, x=4 there's a '0' (his head). At (4,5) on the coordinate list? Actually apple drops list includes (4,5)? No, listed apples: (8,5),(7,1),(1,9),(7,3),(9,8),(0,1),(4,0),(8,2),(9,5),(3,0),(5,1),(2,1),(6,0),(4,2),(2,5). So (4,5) is NOT an apple currently. So he's just on an empty cell.\n\nSo enemy can only move LEFT to (3,5) or RIGHT to (5,5). Both are empty. He might try to run toward apples: (2,5) is an apple to his left, (5,1) is far down. He'll likely go LEFT toward (2,5)!\n\nNow head-on collision risk THIS TURN:\n\nWe are at (5,9), he's at (4,5). Distance: dx=1, dy=4. No possible collision in one move. Safe.\n\nBut CRITICAL: If he moves RIGHT to (5,5), and we move DOWN to (5,8), we'll be aligned vertically with him at x=5, with us at y=8, him at y=5. That sets up a potential future head-on if we both keep moving down/up. But we have length advantage \u2014 that's GOOD for us! If he moves LEFT to (3,5), we lose vertical alignment.\n\nWe want to PRESSURE him while we're longer! If we go DOWN to (5,8), we move closer to him and can potentially chase him down. If we go RIGHT to (6,9), we move away horizontally \u2014 less aggressive.\n\nAlso think about future safe moves: From (5,8) next turn, our body will be head (5,8), then (5,9),(4,9),(4,8) \u2014 tail (3,8) gone. So our neck will be at (5,9) ABOVE us. So next turn from (5,8), we CAN move UP (back into neck) \u2014 illegal! So UP would be out. But we can move DOWN to (5,7), LEFT to (4,8) (might be empty? (4,8) is our old body segment? Actually after this move, (4,8) becomes our 4th segment? Wait length 4, so body: (5,9),(4,9),(4,8) \u2014 yes (4,8) is our tail! So moving LEFT to (4,8) next turn would be into our own tail \u2014 but tails move! Actually if we don't eat an apple this turn, our tail (3,8) disappears, and (4,8) becomes the new tail. So next turn, if we move LEFT to (4,8), that's our own tail \u2014 but since the tail moves forward when we move, that cell might be empty by then? Actually in Snake, you move head forward, each segment follows, tail moves away. So at the start of next turn, (4,8) will be our 3rd segment, not tail? Let's track: current body: [(4,9),(4,8),(3,8)]. After moving DOWN to (5,8), new body: head (5,8), then (5,9),(4,9),(4,8). So (4,8) is the tail. Next turn after moving, tail advances to (4,9)? Actually the tail stays at (4,8) until we move again? I'm overcomplicating \u2014 but generally moving into where your tail is NOW is safe because tail moves away. However, game rules say \"Your head moves into ANY snake's body (including your own)? You're DEAD.\" That includes tail? Yes, tail is part of body. So moving into your own tail is deadly. So we must avoid that.\n\nBetter to keep options open: From (5,8), next turn safe moves likely DOWN (5,7) and RIGHT (6,8). From (6,9), next turn safe moves likely DOWN (6,8) and LEFT (5,9) \u2014 but (5,9) will be our body segment? Actually after moving RIGHT to (6,9), new body: head (6,9), then (5,9),(4,9),(4,8). So (5,9) is our neck \u2014 moving LEFT into it next turn would be illegal. So from (6,9) next turn, only DOWN and RIGHT might be safe.\n\nI think AGGRESSION is key! We have length advantage, enemy is restricted to left/right only this turn. Let's move DOWN to (5,8) to close the distance and threaten him! If he goes LEFT, we can curve left. If he goes RIGHT, we can follow. We want to force him toward a wall or into our body!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Descend toward enemy, use our length to cut off his escape. Try to trap him against the top wall (y=9) or left/right walls. If he eats an apple to tie length, be more cautious but still pressure. Avoid letting him get to apples freely.\n\nDOWN",

HE'S NOW LENGTH 5, HE HAS THE LENGTH ADVANTAGE! \ud83d\ude31 That means head-on collision WE DIE, HE SURVIVES! AVOID DIRECT CONFRONTATION!\n\nCHECK OUR MOVES:\n\nUP \u2192 (5,8) \u2014 that's our own neck! ILLEGAL! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATE!\n\nDOWN \u2192 (5,6) \u2014 empty! But wait... enemy body? Let's check: enemy body is [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), ???]. He just ate, so his tail didn't move! His NEW head is (2,5), his old head (3,5) is now his second segment. His full body: head (2,5), then (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6). So (5,6) is his TAIL! Moving into an enemy's tail is SAFE \u2014 he dies if he runs into us, but his tail is just a body segment. So DOWN to (5,6) is SAFE! \u2705\n\nLEFT \u2192 (4,7) \u2014 empty! Safe! \u2705\n\nRIGHT \u2192 (6,7) \u2014 empty! Safe! \u2705\n\nALL THREE DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe! NICE!\n\nNOW PREDICT ENEMY MOVES FROM (2,5):\nHis neck is at (3,5) to his RIGHT, so he CANNOT move RIGHT into his own neck! His safe moves: UP (2,6), DOWN (2,4), LEFT (1,5). Three options.\n\nWhere will he go? Apples nearby: (2,1) below, (3,3) down-right, (4,2) down-right. He'll likely go DOWN toward the apple cluster! He's longer, he wants to eat and dominate!\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:\nWe are at (5,7), he's at (2,5). Distance dx=3, dy=2. No possible same-cell collision in one move. Safe.\n\nBUT FUTURE TRAPS: If we go DOWN to (5,6), we land on his current tail! That's fine \u2014 but NEXT TURN, his tail will stay there (since he ate, his tail grows, so his old tail (5,6) becomes part of his body, and a new tail appears where his old tail was? Wait, growth mechanics: when you eat, you grow by 1 at the NEXT move. So after moving to (2,5) and eating, his length becomes 5, but his tail is still at (5,6) for now. After this turn's move, he will grow by 1 at the END of the turn, so his tail won't move this turn. So (5,6) will remain his tail until next turn. So if we move to (5,6), we occupy his tail cell \u2014 that's fine, no crash.\n\nBut think AGGRESSIVELY! He's longer, so we need to BOX HIM IN, not fight directly! We can use our body to cut off his escape! Our body is along the top-right edge. We can descend leftward to control the center and bottom-left apple zone!\n\nLEFT to (4,7) gets us closer to the left side, maybe cut him off from going up? DOWN to (5,6) gets us closer to his position and the bottom apples. RIGHT to (6,7) moves away \u2014 not aggressive.\n\nWe want to limit his space! If we go LEFT to (4,7), next turn our neck is at (5,7) to our RIGHT, so RIGHT illegal. Our safe moves then: UP (4,8) \u2014 our own body at (5,8)? Wait, our body after moving left: head (4,7), then (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (4,9). So (4,8) is empty! So UP, DOWN, LEFT possible. Good options.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (5,6), next turn neck at (5,7) above us, so UP illegal. Safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 also three options.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN give flexibility! But DOWN puts us on his old tail \u2014 might bait him into chasing us? He's longer, he might try to trap US!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: He's longer, so we need to force him into a dead end or make him crash into us while we have an escape! Use the board edges! There's an apple at (4,2) \u2014 if we go down-left over the next few turns, we can grab apples and maybe lure him into a corner!\n\nI think LEFT to (4,7) is SMART \u2014 it moves us toward the left side where there are apples (3,3), (4,2), (5,1) and opens future options to descend! We stay one column away from his possible upward path!\n\nLEFT IT IS! LET'S CUT HIM OFF! \ud83d\udc0d\u2694\ufe0f\n\nLEFT",

Let's check: Our snake ID 1: Head (4,7), Body: [(5,7), (5,8), (5,9)]. That's 3 body segments, total length 4. Yes! So our body list is HEAD-TO-TAIL: head (4,7), then (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). That's correct! So our neck is at (5,7) to our RIGHT.\n\nENEMY HEAD: (2,4) \u2014 he moved DOWN from (2,5)! He did NOT eat an apple (apple at (2,1) is far).

Our neck is at (4,7) to our RIGHT.\nENEMY HEAD: (2,3) \u2014 he moved DOWN from (2,4)! He's hunting those bottom apples! His body: [(2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)] \u2014 length 5. His neck is at (2,4) above him.\n\nSCORE: He has 4 apples, we have 3. He's longer by 1! So head-on collision WE DIE, HE SURVIVES! AVOID DIRECT CONFRONTATION!\n\nCHECK OUR MOVES FROM (3,7):\n\nUP \u2192 (3,8) \u2014 empty! Safe! \u2705\nDOWN \u2192 (3,6) \u2014 empty! Safe! \u2705\nLEFT \u2192 (2,7) \u2014 empty!

Good options!\n\nNOW PREDICT ENEMY MOVES FROM (2,3):\nHis neck is at (2,4) above him, so UP is ILLEGAL for him!\nHis safe moves: DOWN (2,2), LEFT (1,3), RIGHT (3,3).\n- DOWN (2,2) is empty.\n- LEFT (1,3) is empty.\n- RIGHT (3,3) \u2014 OH! That's an APPLE at (3,3)! \ud83c\udf4e He will PROBABLY go RIGHT to eat it and grow to length 6! That's BAD for us!\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN:\nWe are at (3,7), he's at (2,3). Distance dx=1, dy=4. No possible same-cell collision in one move. Safe.\n\nBUT if he goes RIGHT to (3,3) and we go DOWN to (3,6), we're on same column, but still far. If we go DOWN two moves later, we could meet him near apples.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: He's about to get longer! We NEED to eat apples FAST! Apples at (4,2), (5,1), (6,0) are clustered bottom-left. We should move DOWN carefully! Also, we can try to BOX HIM IN by controlling the left side.\n\nCHECK SAFE FOLLOW-UPS FOR EACH MOVE:\n\nIf we go UP to (3,8):\n- Next turn neck at (3,7) below, so DOWN illegal.\n- Possible moves: UP (3,9) \u2014 empty, LEFT (2,8) \u2014 empty, RIGHT (4,8) \u2014 empty. That's 3 options! But moves us away from apples.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (3,6):\n- Next turn neck at (3,7) above, so UP illegal.\n- Possible moves: DOWN (3,5) \u2014 WAIT! That's ENEMY BODY! (3,5) is in his body! \ud83d\udc80 So DOWN would be unsafe next turn unless he moves away. He might, but risky. LEFT (2,6) \u2014 empty, RIGHT (4,6) \u2014 empty. So only 2 safe options likely.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (2,7):\n- Next turn neck at (3,7) to our RIGHT, so RIGHT illegal.\n- Possible moves: UP (2,8) \u2014 empty, DOWN (2,6) \u2014 empty, LEFT (1,7) \u2014 empty. That's 3 options! And moves us toward left edge, maybe cut him off?\n\nAGGRESSIVE TRAP IDEA: He's likely going RIGHT to (3,3) to eat apple. If we go DOWN to (3,6), we're directly above him in same column. Next turn we could go DOWN to (3,5) if he moves, or LEFT/RIGHT to flank. But risky if he stays.\n\nCHAT, I THINK WE GO DOWN! \ud83d\ude24 DOWN puts us on path to apples (4,2), (5,1) and pressures him from above! He'll be at (3,3) eating, we'll be at (3,6) \u2014 we can maybe trap him against bottom wall or his own body! PLUS we keep LEFT and RIGHT open next turn if DOWN becomes unsafe!\n\nLET'S GO DOWN AND HUNT! WE NEED THAT APPLE EQUALIZE!\n\nDOWN",

None intersect our immediate area.\n\n**Available Moves for Us**  \n\n| Direction | Target Cell | Occupied? | Apple? | Verdict |\n|-----------|-------------|-----------|--------|---------|\n| UP        | (3,1)       | Empty     | No     | Safe, opens upward corridor |\n| LEFT      | (2,0)       | Empty     | No     | Safe, puts us next to apple at (2,1) |\n| RIGHT     | (4,0)       | **Our own body** \u2013 illegal |\n| DOWN      | (3,-1)      | Off\u2011board \u2013 illegal |\n\nBoth **UP** and **LEFT** are safe this turn. Which one improves our long\u2011term pressure?\n\n- **Apple Sweet Spot**: There\u2019s an apple at (2,1) right above (2,0). Moving LEFT now lets us grab it on the next turn with a simple UP, gaining another point and another growth segment.\n- **Board Control**: Heading left opens the whole left\u2011side corridor (x\u202f=\u202f0\u20112) where several apples sit (0,1), (0,2), (1,4). It also keeps us away from the opponent\u2019s vertical wall, preventing accidental head\u2011on collisions as they descend.\n- **Future Flexibility**: From (2,0) we can continue UP, LEFT, or even loop back right after clearing the left column, keeping many escape routes.\n\nGiven safety, apple opportunity, and strategic positioning, the optimal move is **LEFT**.\n\n**Long\u2011term plan**  \n1. **Turn\u202f24** \u2013 LEFT to (2,0).  \n2. **Turn\u202f25** \u2013 UP to (2,1) and eat the apple.  \n3. Keep hugging the left wall, sweeping upward to collect (0,1), (0,2), (1,4) while the opponent works down the column\u202f4.  \n4. When the opponent reaches the middle of the board, use our length advantage to cut off their path or force a head\u2011on where we have the higher score.\n\nThat will widen our lead and set us up to box the rival later.\n\n**MOVE**  \nLEFT",

He\u2019s eye\u2011balling left or right, but he can\u2019t just drop down into us because (4,3) is already occupied by our tail\u2011segment.  \n\n**Our options**:  \n\n| Dir | Target | Safe? | Apple nearby? |\n|-----|--------|-------|----------------|\n| **UP**   | (3,1) | \u2705 empty, no immediate apple | \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f will need another move to snag anything |\n| **LEFT** | (2,0) | \u2705 empty, right next to apple at (2,1) | \ud83c\udf4e **YES** \u2013 we can gobble that apple on the next turn (UP) and keep the left\u2011wall sweep going |\n| RIGHT | (4,0) | \u274c our own body |\n| DOWN  | (3,-1) | \u274c off\u2011grid |\n\nWhy LEFT?  \n- **Apple combo**: (2,1) is right above, so we\u2019ll net a point on turn\u202f26 with a simple UP.  \n- **Territory**: Sliding into the left corridor opens up a treasure trove of apples at (0,1), (0,2), (1,4)\u2026 perfect for extending our lead.  \n- **Safety**: The enemy can\u2019t reach us in one hop, and we stay clear of his vertical wall.  \n- **Future flex**: From (2,0) we can snake upward, loop left, or even reverse later if we need to dodge a surprise.  \n\n**Short\u2011term game plan**  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Turn\u202f25 \u2013 **LEFT** to (2,0).  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Turn\u202f26 \u2013 **UP** to (2,1) and eat the apple.  \n3\ufe0f\u20e3 Keep hugging the left edge, clearing apples while the opponent battles his own column. When he finally descends, we\u2019ll have the length and space to cut him off or force a head\u2011on where our score advantage wins.\n\nLet\u2019s pounce! \ud83d\ude80  \n\nLEFT",

BUT HE'S STILL STUCK LOW! WE'RE IN A GOOD SPOT AT (4,4) TO START BOXING HIM IN! LET'S CHECK OUR MOVES!\n\nIMMEDIATE MOVE OPTIONS FROM (4,4):\n\nUP \u2192 (4,5) \u2014 THAT'S OUR NECK! (4,5) IS OUR BODY! \ud83d\udc80 ELIMINATE!\nDOWN \u2192 (4,3) \u2014 EMPTY CELL! \u2705\nLEFT \u2192 (3,4) \u2014 EMPTY CELL! \u2705\nRIGHT \u2192 (5,4) \u2014 EMPTY CELL! \u2705\n\nSAFE MOVES: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT! ALL THREE SAFE! NICE!\n\nENEMY MOVES FROM (3,0):\nHIS NECK IS AT (4,0) (RIGHT OF HEAD).

WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHERE HE MIGHT GO AND HOW TO CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE! HIS GOAL IS PROBABLY TO GET NORTH TOWARD MORE APPLES! LOOK AT THE BOARD \u2014 APPLES AT (1,9), (9,8), (0,1), ETC. HE'S GOT A LONG BODY BLOCKING HIM FROM GOING EAST PAST X=4 AT LOW Y. HIS BEST PATH NORTH IS PROBABLY THROUGH (3,1), (3,2), ETC. BUT (3,2) IS HIS OWN BODY! SO IF HE GOES UP TO (3,1), NEXT TURN HE CAN'T GO UP TO (3,2) \u2014 THAT'S HIS BODY! HE'D BE FORCED LEFT OR RIGHT!\n\nOUR PLAN: BUILD A WALL AT Y=3 OR Y=4 TO SEAL HIM OFF! FROM (4,4), IF WE GO DOWN TO (4,3), WE'RE DIRECTLY ON THE LINE! NEXT TURN WE COULD GO TO (4,2) OR (3,3) TO FURTHER BLOCK! IF WE GO LEFT TO (3,4), WE'RE MOVING WEST \u2014 STILL OKAY BUT NOT AS DIRECTLY BLOCKING. IF WE GO RIGHT TO (5,4), WE'RE MOVING EAST AWAY FROM HIM \u2014 NOT AGGRESSIVE!\n\nCHECK FOLLOW-UPS:\n\nIF WE GO DOWN TO (4,3):\n- Next turn neck at (4,4) above, so UP illegal.\n- Moves: DOWN (4,2) \u2014 EMPTY, LEFT (3,3) \u2014 EMPTY, RIGHT (5,3) \u2014 EMPTY.

THREE SAFE OPTIONS! BUT WE'RE SLIGHTLY WEST.\n\nIF WE GO RIGHT TO (5,4):\n- Next turn neck at (4,4) left, so LEFT illegal.\n- Moves: UP (5,5) \u2014 EMPTY, DOWN (5,3) \u2014 EMPTY, RIGHT (6,4) \u2014 EMPTY. THREE SAFE OPTIONS! BUT WE'RE MOVING AWAY FROM THE ACTION!\n\nCHAT, WE NEED TO BE AGGRESSIVE! HE'S LONG BUT HE'S IN A TIGHT SPOT! IF WE CAN GET TO (4,3) NOW, WE CAN POTENTIALLY MOVE TO (4,2) NEXT AND BLOCK HIS NORTHERN ESCAPE COMPLETELY! HE'LL BE TRAPPED AGAINST THE BOTTOM AND HIS OWN BODY! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLET'S GO DOWN TO (4,3)! BUILD THAT WALL! BOX HIM IN! WE CAN'T LET HIM SLIP NORTH! \ud83d\ude24\n\nDOWN",
