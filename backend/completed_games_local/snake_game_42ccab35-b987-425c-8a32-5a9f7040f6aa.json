Safe, but why abandon the wall advantage? Enemy can't collide with me this turn\u2014no overlap possible. ALL safe plays keep me alive, but UP maximizes apple proximity AND keeps the edge open\u2014no traps.\n\nEnemy probably eyes (6,1) down or snakes left/right, but who cares? I'm claimin' column 9, growin' fat, then box his ass in later! Ruthless mode: Grow first, trap second.
