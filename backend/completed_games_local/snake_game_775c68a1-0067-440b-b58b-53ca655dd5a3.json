Yes.\n- Into self? No.\n- Into enemy? No.\n- Safe.\n\n**DOWN** (0, 2):\n- On board? Yes.\n- Into self? No.\n- Into enemy? No.\n- Safe.\n\n**LEFT** (\u22121, 3):\n- On board? No. (x < 0)\n- **Invalid.**\n\n**RIGHT** (1, 3):\n- On board? Yes.\n- Into self? No.\n- Into enemy? No.\n- Safe.\n\n**Eliminated moves**: LEFT.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of Safe Moves\n\nNow I'll evaluate the three safe options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n#### 1. UP (0, 4)\n\n- **Future moves next turn**: UP (0,5), DOWN (0,3 - into self, illegal), LEFT (\u22121,4 - off board), RIGHT (1,4).\n  - Two follow-up moves: UP, RIGHT.\n- **Proximity to apples**:\n  - Closest apple is at (2, 8) \u2014 this move gets me slightly closer (y from 3 to 4).\n  - Other apples are at (8,7), (5,5), (9,4), (6,3). This move increases distance from most of them.\n- **Risky?**: Cell (0, 4) is on an open area of the board. No immediate collision risk with the enemy expected.\n\n#### 2. DOWN (0, 2)\n\n- **Future moves next turn**: UP (0,3 - into self, illegal), DOWN (0,1), LEFT (\u22121,2 - off board), RIGHT (1,2).\n  - Two follow-up moves: DOWN, RIGHT.\n- **Proximity to apples**:\n  - This move brings me further from almost all apples.\n  - Apple at (6,3) is close, but I move further away from it.\n- **Risky?**: The bottom of the board is generally a bad long-term position. This move pushes me toward a dead-end.\n\n#### 3. RIGHT (1, 3)\n\n- **Future moves next turn**: UP (1,4), DOWN (1,2), LEFT (0,3 - into self, illegal), RIGHT (2,3).\n  - Three follow-up moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n- **Proximity to apples**:\n  - Apple at (6, 3). This move keeps me on the same y-level and moves me toward it (x from 0 to 1).\n- **Risky?**: Cell (1, 3) is open. It's slightly closer to enemy snake #0 at (6,4) than staying at (0,3), but not in a dangerous way.\n\n---\n\n### Comparing the Safe Options\n\n- **LEFT** is eliminated.\n- **DOWN** leads to fewer options and pushes me toward a dead-end. It's the least favorable.\n- **UP** increases y-level, which slightly helps toward the apple at (2, 8) but offers only two possible next moves.\n- **RIGHT** offers the most future options (three directions) and is a direct step toward the apple at (6, 3). It's the safest and most strategic move.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision\n\n**Plan for next few turns**: Move RIGHT toward the apple at (6, 3). It's the closest reachable apple and moving toward it will open up more strategic options. The enemy is on the other side of the board, so there\u2019s time to collect at least one apple before it becomes a major threat.\n\nRIGHT",

No: when you eat, you grow, so the moved head position becomes new, and you add a new segment\u2014functionally, for our head/tail list, the tail stays the same, and a new segment is added behind the new head position. But in terms of positions, after moving UP to (5,5) and growing, snake becomes [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]. LEFT to (4,4) is safe, open space. RIGHT to (6,4) is safe, open space. No collisions possible this turn since enemy is far away at (1,1), length 1, and simultaneous movement means no head-on unless paths cross perfectly, which they don't for any of these\u2014my moves keep me in upper mid-board, enemy is bottom left.\n\nFavoring moves that eat apples and keep options: UP directly eats (5,5) and positions me at length 3 with a fully open left/right column (x=4 empty above me at y=4-5, x=6 similar), plus up/down except backward (but up restores column 5 openness).

Head UP next if board stays clear, potentially reaching y=6-7 in 1-2 moves for vertical momentum/use center as loop zone to eat upper apples, avoid bottom clustering (enemy might push up/left). Enemy likely targets (4,1)\u2014don't chase if it risks positional advantage; focus on outscoring to 3-4 apples in 2-4 turns, then flanking for wins if enemy extends (their length 1 still). If they move up after eating, be ready to block paths near their likely trajectory but only if easy/safe. Keep center-up open for circling. Monitor for traps after any growth.",

Possible moves are:\n- **UP** \u2192 (1, 2)\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (1, 0)\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0, 1)\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 1)\n\n#### Check for immediate death:\n- **UP** (1, 2): Safe\n- **DOWN** (1, 0): Safe\n- **LEFT** (0, 1): Safe\n- **RIGHT** (2, 1): Safe\n\nAll moves are on the board and don't collide with any existing body segments or heads. None of them are backwards moves since the snake has no body yet.\n\nAll four directions are safe.\n\n### Step 2: Strategic Evaluation\n\nLet's evaluate each option strategically by considering proximity to apples and avoiding enemy snake.\n\n- **UP (1, 2)**:\n  - Gets me further from the edge and closer to center.\n  - No immediate apple, but opens up more board space.\n  - Distance to nearest apples:\n    - Apple at (2, 8) \u2192 Manhattan distance = |2-1| + |8-2| = 7\n    - Apple at (4, 1) \u2192 Manhattan distance = |4-1| + |1-2| = 3+\n  - Keeps options open.\n\n- **DOWN (1, 0)**:\n  - Moves me toward the bottom edge.\n  - Risky as it limits future movement options quickly.\n  - Apple at (4, 1) is nearby, but moving down puts me closer to the edge which can become a trap.\n\n- **LEFT (0, 1)**:\n  - Moves me left along the same row.\n  - Apple at (4, 1) is in the same row.\n  - Could be useful if I want to go after that apple.\n  - However, going left also confines me toward the wall potentially.\n\n- **RIGHT (2, 1)**:\n  - Moves me toward the center.\n  - Apple at (4, 1) is in same row, and this gets me closer to possible paths toward multiple apples.\n  - Better than staying on the edge.\n\nAmong the safe options:\n- RIGHT (2,1) seems like a good balance between moving toward open space and heading in the direction of future apple possibilities.\n- UP is also a solid choice to avoid edges.\n- LEFT would keep me on the edge for now, which might be okay but could be restrictive.\n- DOWN is risky as it brings me toward bottom edge.\n\n### Step 3: Consider Enemy Moves\n\nEnemy snake #0:\n- Head: (5,4)\n- Body: [(5,3)] \u2013 tail at (5,3)\n- Apple collected: 1\n\nPossible moves for enemy snake #0:\n- UP (5,5), DOWN (5,3 \u2013 into its body \u2013 not allowed), LEFT (4,4), RIGHT (6,4)\n\nMost likely moves are UP or LEFT or RIGHT, moving away from its own body.\n\nIf it moves UP to (5,5), it might go after the apple at (5,5), leading to a potential collision or need to react later.\n\nIf it moves LEFT or RIGHT, it goes away from apple cluster in middle.\n\nSince my snake is at (1,1) far from immediate danger of direct collision with enemy, I don't need to worry too much here.\n\n### Final Reasoning and Plan\n\n- **Preferred move**: RIGHT \u2013 gets me toward the center and sets up path to apple at (4,1)\n- Next few turns: Aim to get closer to reachable apples while keeping space options open. Watch enemy's movement next turn.\n\n**Final decision**: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

No apples adjacent, so this move is positional: UP best extends vertical momentum per last plan, avoiding risky side pursuit of (4,1) (enemy probably targeting it soon, netting 1 point and length 2\u2014don't chase at my length 3), maximizes future options (straight up keeps >2 branch points near y=6-7, vs. ~2 left/right), and positions for zigzagging to upper apples in 2-4 moves (e.g., (5,6) \u2192 (5,7) \u2192 (6,7) \u2192 etc. toward (8,7)).

Prioritizing: UP aligns with last plan for vertical momentum, builds toward the 3 upper apples ((2,8), (3,8), (8,7)) via efficient zigs (e.g., from 5,7 LEFT/RIGHT toward left or right apples), avoids potential enemy left-upward growth, and keeps >2 branch points open (still no tight spaces). LEFT/RIGHT are viable but slightly shift sideways sooner, potentially constraining if needing quick t-units or retreats\u2014UP maximizes scoring pace with the enemy trailing at 0 apples/length 1.\n\n**SHORT LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS**  \nAt (5,7), length 3 (assuming enemy eats for 1 apple/length 2), continue zigzagging for upper apples: next likely UP (stays vertical/central if not eating (2,8)/(3,8), or LEFT to (4,7) if eyeing (2,8)/(3,8), or RIGHT to (6,7) if pivoting toward (8,7)). After (5,7), target (2,8) or (3,8) in 2-4 moves via LEFT/RIGHT mix (e.g., (5,7)-(4,7)-(3,7)-(3,8)), or loop up for (8,7) if enemy lags down-low. Don't chase (4,1) yet unless enemy dies/leaves space\u2014focus flexibility in column 5 for retreats if blocked. Aim for 1-2 more apples in next 5 turns before enemy closes the apple gap; if enemy blocks left, flank right via (6,8) row.\n\nUP",

UP from (3, 2) -> moves to (3, 3)\n2. DOWN from (3, 2) -> moves to (3, 1)\n3. LEFT from (3, 2) -> moves to (2, 2)\n4.

No body.\n   - Into enemy snake body or head? Not (3,3) is not occupied by enemy yet.\n   - Safe.\n\n2. DOWN to (3, 1):\n   - On board? Yes.\n   - Into my own body?

This seems like a good strategic direction. It also opens up access to (4, 1) next turn, potentially contesting it before enemy snake can get there.\n\nAlso considering enemy snake at (4,8). Moving to (4,2) puts me on same x-coordinate but far below. Their likely optimal target would be other apples nearby like (3,8) or (2,8) or (9,4). Since their head is at (4,8), they may try going toward (3,8) which is UP next to them.\n\nMy current strategy: Move toward the nearest reachable apple safely while avoiding head-to-head conflict given enemy's position.\n\nRIGHT looks like a good choice.\n\nRIGHT",

Skipping this eats to chase less immediate gains (like DOWN toward (4,1) in row 1, which would require more turns downward while potentially giving ground to enemy advances) reduces near-term momentum unnecessarily.\n\nNo obvious head-on risks with enemy #1: even if it moves UP to (4,3) or RIGHT to (5,2), you're well-separated and can react next turn.\n\n**SHORT LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS**  \nAfter LEFT to (2,8) and eating (apples now 4), pivot strategically from new head (2,8) with body [(3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (5,7)]: immediately asses UPPER-ROW CLOUT: move LEFT to (1,8) for another potential LEFT to (0,8) next turn, accessing the left side's empty space while keeping row 8 fluidity (UP/DOWN open), or shift DOWN to (2,7) to flank toward central (5,5) if enemy #1 heads TRULY up (though it's bottomed out and likely slow). Watch enemy #1's upward push\u2014if it climbs column 4, dodge by swinging west via row 7/6 toward (4,1) bottom, but prioritize upper-left eats first to max score gap.\n\nLEFT",

I need to make a strategic decision now.\n- The board is 10x10, so the edges are at 0 and 9 on both axes.\n\n**Immediate Safety Check:**\n- My head is at (6, 2). I have no body, so I can't collide with myself.\n- The enemy snake's head is at (1, 6). It's far enough that a single move won't bring our heads into contact.\n- The enemy snake's body occupies: [(1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8)]. I must avoid these cells.\n- I must also avoid going off the board.\n\n**Analyzing Moves:**\n- UP to (6, 3): Safe. No immediate collision with enemy body or board edge. Moves me closer to apples at (5, 5) and (8, 3).\n- DOWN to (6, 1): Safe. No immediate collision. Moves me away from the center but toward apple at (4, 1) and (8, 3) (sort of, it's less direct).\n- LEFT to (5, 2): Safe. No immediate collision. Moves me toward apple at (4, 1) and (5, 5). This seems like a strong candidate.\n- RIGHT to (7, 2): Safe. No immediate collision. Moves me toward apples at (8, 3) and (8, 7). Also a good candidate.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\n- The enemy snake has 5 apples and is likely focused on pathing or avoiding me.\n- I have 0 apples and need to grow.\n- The apples at (5, 5) and (8, 3) seem most approachable from my current position.\n- Move LEFT to (5, 2) puts me on a direct path toward (5, 5) and (4, 1).\n- Move RIGHT to (7, 2) puts me on a direct path toward (8, 3) and (8, 7).\n- UP and DOWN are less direct for apple approach but offer more positional flexibility.\n\n**Future Moves Evaluation:**\n- After LEFT (5, 2): my next safe moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT. RIGHT would hit my own body.\n- After RIGHT (7, 2): my next safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n- After UP (6, 3) or DOWN (6, 1): I still have three direction options.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Between LEFT and RIGHT, RIGHT seems slightly better for apple acquisition (two apples vs. one directly on path), though LEFT is more central.\n- UP appears riskier in terms of immediate conflict with the enemy later on.\n- Choosing RIGHT (7, 2) keeps me in open space, heading toward a pair of apples with fewer immediate collidables nearby. It also avoids giving the enemy any incentive to chase me early.\n\n### Strategic Note\nShort term goal: Head to apple at (8, 3) as it's close and not too exposed. Long term: Stay mobile and avoid bottlenecks near the enemy snake with 5 apples.\n\nRIGHT",

No body yet.\n- Apples are at: (8, 7), (9, 4), (4, 1), (5, 5), (8, 3).\n- Enemy snake (ID 0) head at (2, 5), body: [(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8)].\n- I am trying to get closer to the nearest apples while staying safe.\n\n**Immediate Safety Check:**\n- Head at (7, 3). No body, so only need to avoid board edges and enemy snake.\n- Must not move to:\n  - Off the board.\n  - Into enemy snake body or head.\n\nEnemy body positions: (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8).  \nEnemy head is at (2, 5). Next turn, it might move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT (but mostly likely DOWN or RIGHT to chase apples or space).\n\nSo for this turn:\n\n**Analyzing possible moves:**\n\n- **UP to (7, 4):**\n  - Safe from board edge and enemy body.\n  - Moves me closer to apples at (8, 7) and especially (8, 3) via a future RIGHT move.\n  - Keeps most options open: can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT next turn.\n  - Good positional choice.\n\n- **DOWN to (7, 2):**\n  - Safe.\n  - Less directly useful now, although still open.\n  - Moves me slightly away from the primary apple targets.\n\n- **LEFT to (6, 3):**\n  - Safe.\n  - Closer to (5, 5) and (4, 1), but slower path than heading toward (8, 3).\n\n- **RIGHT to (8, 3):**\n  - Safe.\n  - Moves me directly onto the apple at (8, 3). Immediate gain.\n  - Would win the apple this turn, which is very strong.\n  - Only risk is that the enemy could try to compete for it next turn if it starts moving toward (8, 3) now.\n\n**Risk analysis of RIGHT move:**\n- If I move RIGHT to (8, 3), I collect the apple. Great.\n- But the enemy snake at (2, 5) is relatively far away and has a convoluted body shape. Its head is moving this turn too.\n- Even if it chose to go toward (8, 3) in a straight shot (e.g. RIGHT x5, UP x2), it would take 7 moves. I can get there in 1.\n- So moving RIGHT is safe and rewards my movement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTaking the apple at (8, 3) is not just safe, but the best immediate use of my turn.\n\n### Strategic Note\nShort-term: Collect apple at (8, 3) to grow.  \nLong-term: Keep heading right and upward after growing to chase higher apples like (8,7) and (9,4). Avoid getting trapped near left side where enemy is coiled.\n\nRIGHT",

My body was only (9, 1), and that cell is now empty unless tail didn't move. Wait, no \u2014 snakes move all parts forward. So, tail vacates (9, 1) and extends head. Since I did not eat last turn, my tail moved off (9, 1), so (9, 1) is now empty. NEW head at (8, 1) \u2014 then (9, 1) is now free.\n- But wait, you cannot move BACKWARDS into where your tail used to be if tail did not move, but in this case tail moved. Actually, the STRICT rule is: you cannot move into the cell directly behind the head (backwards). From head (8,1), your body is at (9,1) \u2014 so moving LEFT into (7,1) is okay because (9,1) is not blocking that. Correction: body was at (9,1). The move LEFT from (8,1) to (7,1) is not backward into (9,1). It's not backward. It's forward in a new direction, OK. So it's valid.\n\nActually, let\u2019s recheck: LEFT from (8,1) takes you to (7,1). The cell behind your head is (9,1), and you\u2019re not moving there \u2014 so no self-collision.\n\nStill, wait. Is there any snake body in (7, 1)?\n\n- My body? No.\n- Enemy body? It's at (5,4), (5,5), (4,5), etc. So (7,1) is clear.\n\nSo LEFT is safe.\n\n#### RIGHT to (9, 1):\n- That's the body segment \u2014 cannot move into yourself.\n- \u274c Invalid.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT\n\n### Evaluate Which Move is Best:\n\n#### LEFT:\n- Moves to (7, 1)\n- Near to closest apple at (4, 1) \u2014 but going LEFT means increasing distance.\n- Actually, (4,1) is on the board.\n- (7,1) is further from (4,1) in x.\n- But let\u2019s look at all apples:\n  - (8,7)\n  - (9,4)\n  - (4,1)\n  - (7,8)\n  - (6,8)\n- From (8,1):\n  - (7,1) is closer in x to (4,1) than (8,1) was \u2014 decreases x.\n  - But it moves you away from (8,7), (7,8), (6,8)\n  - You are near the right edge. Moving LEFT might close in snake if you want to avoid walls.\n  - Could allow further mobility in future turns \u2014 not an edge yet, but one step left from (7,1) to (6,1) would be okay.\n\n#### UP:\n- To (8, 2)\n- Neutral x.\n- Goes toward (8,7).\n- Leads toward apples.\n- No immediate trap.\n- Leaves many follow-up moves.\n\n#### DOWN:\n- To (8, 0)\n- Limits vertical movement.\n- Close to bottom edge.\n- No apples at y=0.\n- Less flexible \u2014 could quickly limit mobility.\n- No real strategic value.\n\nSo better candidates: UP and LEFT.\n\nUP clearly moves toward more apples (e.g. (8,7)) and keeps option open to continue upward or left later. LEFT gets you moving toward (4,1) \u2014 but it's not the closest apple now and would take you further from center where other apples are.\n\nAlso using longer-term view:\n\n- After UP: (8,2) \u2014 still can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT next.\n- After LEFT: (7,1) \u2014 still can go UP, DOWN, LEFT next.\n\nBut UP moves toward more apples centrally. LEFT moves you into the mid-area from edge.\n\nThe enemy is far (at (5,3)), so no immediate danger, but you are snake 1, they have 7 apples, you have 1.\n\n**Decision**: Prefer **UP** because it moves toward apples (e.g. at (8,7)), and keeps you in more central area with more mobility.\n\n### Final Move:\nUP",
