Actually (7,7) is at (7,7), from (8,5) distance = 1 + 2 = 3. From (8,4) to (7,7) = 1 + 3 = 4, so UP improves distance to (7,7).  \n- LEFT to (7,4) \u2013 distance to (5,4) = 2, to (7,7) = 3.  \n- DOWN to (8,3) \u2013 farther from both apples.  \n- RIGHT to (9,4) \u2013 farther from both apples.  \n\nSo best moves for apples: LEFT (toward (5,4)) or UP (toward (7,7)).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future options after move:**  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (7,4):  \n- Next turn I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT unless blocked. Still open board.  \n\nIf I go UP to (8,5):  \n- Next turn I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT unless blocked. Still open board.  \n\nBoth are fine.  \n\nBut (5,4) is also reachable by enemy? Enemy at (2,3) is closer to (5,4) in Manhattan distance?  \nEnemy to (5,4): |2-5| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4.  \nMe to (5,4): currently 3, after LEFT to (7,4) distance = 2. So I can beat enemy to it if I move left now and then left/down next turns.  \n\nAlso, (7,7) is not contested immediately.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \n\nI should go for (5,4) first because it's closest and I can get it before enemy possibly moves toward it. After eating, I'll have length 2, more flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove toward (5,4) via LEFT now to (7,4), then next turn likely LEFT again to (6,4) or DOWN to (6,3) if needed to avoid enemy. Enemy may go for (2,2) apple this turn.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

No apple at (5, 5), so length stays 2, body becomes [(5, 5), (5, 4)] (tail at old head). From (5, 5), possible moves: UP (5, 6), DOWN (5, 4) (body next turn), LEFT (4, 5), RIGHT (6, 5). DOWN would be into own body \u2192 so 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n- DOWN to (5, 3): No apple. Body becomes [(5, 3), (5, 4)]. From (5, 3), UP (5, 4) is body, so 3 safe moves.  \n\n- LEFT to (4, 4): No apple. Body becomes [(4, 4), (5, 4)]. From (4, 4), RIGHT (5, 4) is body, so 3 safe moves.  \n\nAll three safe moves give same immediate length, but UP moves toward more apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy apple competition:**  \nEnemy at (1, 3) could go UP to (1, 4) and eat apple (1, 4) next turn. That\u2019s their closest apple. I can\u2019t stop them from getting it unless I go there, but I\u2019m 4 steps away. So I should focus on nearest apples to me: (5, 9) and (7, 7).  \n\nUP gets me closer to both (5, 9) and (7, 7).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter moving UP to (5, 5), next turn avoid DOWN into own body. Consider moving UP or LEFT/RIGHT to approach (7, 7) or (5, 9). Keep an eye on enemy moving toward (1, 4) apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:** UP is safe, moves toward two apples, keeps options open.  \n\nUP",

Wait: when you eat apple, you grow by 1 segment at the end of the turn, so next turn body will be [(5,7), (6,7), (6,6), (6,5)]).  \nFrom (5, 7) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 8) \u2013 empty  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 6) \u2013 empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 7) \u2013 empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 7) \u2013 my own body (unsafe)  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**If RIGHT to (7, 7) and eat apple:**  \nBody next turn: [(7,7), (6,7), (6,6), (6,5)]  \nFrom (7, 7):  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 8) \u2013 empty  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 6) \u2013 empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 7) \u2013 my own body (unsafe)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 7) \u2013 empty  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**If UP to (6, 8) (no apple):**  \nBody next turn: [(6,8), (6,7), (6,6)] (tail (6,5) gone)  \nFrom (6, 8):  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 9) \u2013 empty  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 7) \u2013 my own body (unsafe)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 8) \u2013 empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 8) \u2013 empty  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nAll three options give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Enemy movement and apple competition  \nEnemy at (1, 7) might go LEFT to (0, 7) for apple, or UP to (1, 8). They are far from (5, 7) and (7, 7).  \nIf I go LEFT to (5, 7), I eat apple and grow to length 4, enemy stays length 3 unless they eat (0, 7).  \nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 7), same effect.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan note  \nEating an apple now gives me a length advantage over enemy if they don\u2019t eat one. Both LEFT and RIGHT are safe and give apples. Which is better?  \n\nCheck board:  \n- LEFT to (5, 7): puts me closer to apple (5, 9) for future.  \n- RIGHT to (7, 7): puts me closer to apple (7, 9) and also near (7, 9).  \n\nBut also consider enemy\u2019s possible moves: they might go toward (5, 9) later, but they\u2019re far now.  \n\nI think taking either apple is fine. Let\u2019s pick LEFT because (5, 7) is slightly farther from enemy\u2019s possible path (they might go to (0, 7) or (1,8)), leaving (7, 7) for later if needed, but actually both are safe.  \n\nBut wait \u2014 after eating apple at (5, 7), my body occupies (6,7), (6,6), (6,5), head at (5,7). That\u2019s fine.  \n\nActually, looking at the board, if I go LEFT to (5,7), next turn I can go UP to (5,8) toward (5,9) or DOWN to (5,6) to avoid dead ends.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:** Both LEFT and RIGHT are safe and get apples. I\u2019ll choose LEFT to eat (5, 7) and grow, giving a length advantage.  \n\nLEFT",

That\u2019s fine.  \n\nBut enemy might move toward (9, 6) next turn? Enemy at (3, 6) is far, can\u2019t reach (9, 6) in one move.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning  \nIf I eat apple now, I\u2019m at length 8 vs enemy length 6. That\u2019s good.  \nBut after eating, I\u2019ll be at (9, 6) with only UP/DOWN safe next turn \u2014 could get trapped along right wall.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 5), I keep more options and can still eat (9, 6) next turn if enemy doesn\u2019t take it. But enemy is far, so (9, 6) likely remains.  \n\nActually, if enemy moves toward (5, 5) or (7, 3), they won\u2019t take (9, 6).  \n\nSo maybe safest is DOWN now, then RIGHT next turn to eat (9, 6) with more space.  \n\nBut eating now gives immediate point lead and might force enemy to take risks.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT eats apple now, increases lead, and is safe this turn. Next turn I\u2019ll have UP/DOWN options along right wall \u2014 not ideal but manageable.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (9, 6) and eating apple, next turn choose UP or DOWN based on safety. Possibly aim to wrap toward (7, 3) or (5, 5) afterward.  \n\nRIGHT",

My safe moves (9, 4) and (8, 5) are not in those.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn  \nEnemy head at (4, 5) can move:  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 6) \u2013 empty  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 4) \u2013 empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 5) \u2013 its own body \u2192 unsafe  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 5) \u2013 apple there  \n\nEnemy\u2019s possible head positions after move: (4, 6), (4, 4), (5, 5).  \nMy safe moves: (9, 4), (8, 5).  \nNo overlap \u2192 no immediate head-on collision.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting and future safety  \n\n**DOWN to (9, 4):**  \n- No apple eaten.  \n- Next turn from (9, 4):  \n  New body after move (no growth): [(9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9)]  \n  - UP: (9, 5) my body \u2192 unsafe  \n  - DOWN: (9, 3) empty  \n  - LEFT: (8, 4) empty  \n  - RIGHT: wall \u2192 unsafe  \n  So safe next moves: DOWN, LEFT (2 options).  \n\n**LEFT to (8, 5):**  \n- No apple eaten.  \n- Next turn from (8, 5):  \n  New body: [(8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9)]  \n  - UP: (8, 6) my body \u2192 unsafe  \n  - DOWN: (8, 4) empty  \n  - LEFT: (7, 5) empty  \n  - RIGHT: (9, 5) my body \u2192 unsafe  \n  So safe next moves: DOWN, LEFT (2 options).  \n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT give 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity and board position  \nApples: (7, 3), (5, 5) are closest to me.  \nFrom (9, 5):  \n- LEFT to (8, 5) is 1 step closer to (7, 3) and (5, 5) than staying at (9, 5).  \n- DOWN to (9, 4) is slightly further from those apples but moves toward (7, 3) in the y-direction.  \n\nBut (7, 3) is at y=3, so from (9, 4), I\u2019d need LEFT and DOWN to reach it. From (8, 5), I\u2019d need LEFT and DOWN as well, but (8, 5) is closer in x to apple (7, 3).  \n\nAlso, enemy at (4, 5) might go RIGHT to (5, 5) to eat that apple and grow. If I go LEFT to (8, 5), I\u2019m still far from (5, 5) and not competing directly this turn.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning  \nI\u2019m longer than enemy (8 vs 6). I should avoid getting trapped along right wall. LEFT opens more central space. DOWN keeps me near right wall, which could limit future options after a few moves.  \n\nBetter to move toward center: LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter LEFT to (8, 5), next turn consider DOWN to (8, 4) or LEFT to (7, 5) to approach apple (7, 3). Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s possible move toward (5, 5).  \n\nLEFT",

Actually, (5, 5) is enemy body, so moving LEFT to (6, 5) is safe this turn, but next turn if enemy moves to (6, 4), we\u2019d be adjacent vertically/horizontally? Wait: (6, 5) me vs (6, 4) enemy \u2192 not same cell, so no immediate collision, but possible head-on next turn if I go DOWN to (6, 4) while enemy goes UP to (6, 4) \u2014 but that\u2019s a future risk.  \n\nBetter to keep distance. DOWN to (7, 4) keeps me farther from enemy\u2019s likely moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI\u2019m longer than enemy (8 vs 7). I can afford to be slightly cautious.  \nApple (7, 3) is reachable in 2 turns if I go DOWN now.  \nEnemy might also go for (7, 3) but they are farther.  \n\nGoing DOWN gives good future options (3 safe moves next turn) and moves toward apple.  \nLEFT gives fewer options (2 safe moves) and doesn\u2019t progress toward nearest apple.  \nUP is nearly a trap (only 1 safe move next).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 4), if enemy not blocking, go DOWN to (7, 3) to eat apple. Watch enemy\u2019s new head position to avoid head-on.  \n\nDOWN",

But I\u2019ll have 3 exits.  \nIf I don\u2019t eat apple now, enemy could eat more apples faster.  \n\nBetter to eat now and extend lead.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan after this move**  \nFrom (7, 1), I can go DOWN to (7, 0), then LEFT toward (2, 1) or RIGHT toward (9, 9) depending on enemy position.  \nAvoid moving toward enemy head if it\u2019s close.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN eats apple safely, increases score lead, no immediate danger, keeps options open.  \n\nDOWN",

More future flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction**\nEnemy at (1, 2) safe moves: UP (1, 3), LEFT (0, 2).  \nEnemy might go UP toward apple (1, 8) or LEFT toward apple (0, 7). Either way, enemy is moving away from my area (right side).  \nEnemy is shorter than me (length 9 vs my 11), so I can be slightly more aggressive, but need to avoid dead ends.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**\nLEFT gives more safe moves next turn (3 vs 2 from DOWN).  \nLEFT also keeps me at y=1, so I can potentially go RIGHT later toward (9, 1) apple, maybe after maneuvering.  \nDOWN reduces my y to 0, limiting upward movement and possibly boxing me near bottom edge.\n\nGiven the board, LEFT seems better for maintaining options.  \nAlso, from (4, 1), I can go UP next to (4, 2) and then maybe toward (4, 6) apple if safe, or continue left/down to open space.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**\nI\u2019m going LEFT to (4, 1) to keep flexibility.

Enemy is moving away from my area.  \nIf I go UP to (4,2), I\u2019m moving toward enemy\u2019s general area but not directly into it. However, only 1 safe move next turn is dangerous.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP gives apple progress but traps me next turn (only LEFT available). That\u2019s too risky\u2014if that left cell (3,2) becomes blocked by enemy next turn, I die.  \nDOWN gives 2 safe moves next turn but moves away from apples.  \nLEFT gives 3 safe moves next turn and keeps options open.  \n\nBetter to stay safe and keep flexibility. I\u2019ll go LEFT to (3,1) to maintain maneuverability, then reassess next turn for apple paths.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,1), consider moving toward (4,6) via UP if safe, or toward (9,1) via RIGHT later. Avoid boxing myself near bottom-left corner. Enemy is moving upward, so left side may open up.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy is moving away from my area. If I go UP to (3,2), I\u2019m moving toward (4,6) but also closer to enemy\u2019s possible path if it goes RIGHT then DOWN later. Still relatively safe.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP gives best apple progress and same future safety as other moves (2 options next turn). It also keeps me away from enemy\u2019s immediate area. DOWN and LEFT move away from apples and corner me more.  \n\nI\u2019ll go UP to progress toward (4,6) while maintaining reasonable future options.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,2), I can go LEFT or RIGHT. Check enemy position then. If enemy is far, consider moving toward (4,6) via RIGHT if safe, else LEFT to open space. Avoid (3,3) enemy body.\n\nUP",
