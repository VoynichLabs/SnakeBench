All legal moves keep me alive this turn; the priority is getting to apples while keeping escape options.\n\nChoice and short plan:\n- I choose RIGHT to move toward the apple at (7,3). RIGHT gives a short, safe path to that apple (7,1 \u2192 7,2 \u2192 7,3) while keeping multiple follow-up options (UP to continue to the apple, RIGHT/UP to access the north cluster, or LEFT to return toward central apples). After taking (7,3) I\u2019ll reassess and target (4,4) or the north apples depending on enemy movement.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving RIGHT to (1, 8) opens up multiple future options - I can continue moving EAST toward the center of the board to access the other apples, or move NORTH/SOUTH as needed. Being in the corner limits my movement options significantly, so moving toward the center is strategically better.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6, 1) in the bottom-right area, so moving eastward keeps me in the top-left quadrant where I have space to maneuver and collect more apples before potentially encountering the enemy.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (1, 8), I'll have more options to move toward apples at (2, 8), (4, 4), or continue building a path along the top or right side of my current position.\n\nRIGHT",
