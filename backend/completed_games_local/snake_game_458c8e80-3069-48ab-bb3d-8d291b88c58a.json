Since I moved LEFT last turn to get here, continuing LEFT puts me on the same x-coordinate as the apple (3). On the next turn, I can move UP to collect it.\n\n**Strategy for next few turns:**\nMove to (3, 5) to collect the apple. Then, evaluate the position of the apple at (0, 1) or (1, 9).

Moves toward (1, 9).\n2.  **DOWN (3, 4):** **INVALID.** This is moving directly into my own body.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 5):** Safe. Moves toward (1, 9) and (0, 1).\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 5):** Safe. Moves toward (8, 5) and (5, 2).\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\n*   The apple at (8, 5) is 5 units away from me and 3 units away from the enemy. The enemy is very likely to go for (9, 9) first, then potentially (8, 5).\n*   The apple at (5, 2) is 5 units away from me.\n*   The apple at (0, 1) is 7 units away.\n*   The apple at (1, 9) is 6 units away.\n*   The enemy (Snake #0) is at (8, 8). Their closest apples are (9, 9) and (8, 5).\n\n**Path Selection:**\nIf I go RIGHT, I contest (8, 5) and (5, 2), but I'm moving toward the enemy. If I go LEFT or UP, I move toward (1, 9) or (0, 1) in a more open area.\nGiven the current head position (3, 5), (5, 2) is a solid secondary target. However, moving RIGHT to (4, 5) puts me in a good position to pivot either DOWN to (5, 2) or UP to (1, 9) later, while keeping distance from the wall.\nActually, the most efficient path to an apple from (3, 5) is (5, 2) (distance 5) or (8, 5) (distance 5). (1, 9) is distance 6.\n\nLet's prioritize the southern/central apples to stay away from the enemy's corner.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nMove towards (5, 2) or (8, 5). Taking (5, 2) first seems safer as it's further from the enemy's likely path to (9,9) and (8,5).\n\nRIGHT",

If they move DOWN to (5, 5), it is a head-on collision and we both die. Even if they move elsewhere, I'm moving toward their head.\n4.  **DOWN (5, 3):** Safe. Moves toward the apples at (5, 2) and (6, 1).\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\nSnake #0 is at (5, 6), exactly two squares above me. If I move UP and they move DOWN, we collide. Given the apple at (3, 4), I want to maintain distance from the enemy while securing food.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\n*   **LEFT to (4, 4):** This is the most direct path to the apple at (3, 4). It also increases the horizontal distance from the enemy, making a collision less likely in the immediate next turn.\n*   **DOWN to (5, 3):** This moves toward the lower apples but keeps me on the same X-axis as the enemy, which could lead to complications if they continue moving down.\n\nThe apple at (3, 4) is only 2 moves away. Moving LEFT puts me at (4, 4), then (3, 4).\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (4, 4) to grab the apple at (3, 4). This move keeps space between me and Snake #0 and aligns me with a nearby target.\n\nLEFT",

This also puts me one step away from the apple at (5, 2).\n\n**Strategic Plan:**\nMy immediate goal is to collect the apples at (5, 2) and (6, 1). \n*   If I move **DOWN** to (4, 2), my next move to (5, 2) would be **RIGHT**.\n*   If I move **RIGHT** to (5, 3), my next move to (5, 2) would be **DOWN**.\n\nBoth are safe, but moving **DOWN** to (4, 2) now is slightly more efficient for a sweep of the bottom apples. From (4, 2), I can go (5, 2) -> (6, 1) -> then turn back left toward (0, 1) and (0, 2). Snake #0 is far enough away that I don't need to worry about a head-on collision or interference for the (5, 2) apple this turn.\n\n**Plan for Next Turns:**\nHead to (5, 2), then (6, 1). After that, circle back westward along the bottom of the board to collect (0, 1) and (0, 2).\n\nDOWN",

Body: [(6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7)]. \n*   **Movement Options from (8, 9):**\n    1.  **LEFT (7, 9):** **SAFE.** This moves me closer to the apple at (3, 9).\n    2.  **RIGHT (9, 9):** **INVALID.** This is my neck/previous head position.\n    3.  **DOWN (8, 8):** **SAFE.** This keeps me away from the wall but moves me closer to Snake #0's territory.\n    4.  **UP (8, 10):** **INVALID.** Out of bounds.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n*   **Snake #0 Threat:** Snake 0 is at (5, 8). Its possible moves are (4, 8), (6, 8) - invalid, (5, 9), or (5, 7). If it moves to (5, 9), it is heading for the apple at (3, 9).\n*   **Contesting (3, 9):** \n    - My distance to (3, 9) from (8, 9): 5 steps (LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT, LEFT).\n    - Snake 0 distance to (3, 9) from (5, 8): 3 steps (UP, LEFT, LEFT).\n    Snake 0 will likely reach the apple at (3, 9) before me. However, I must keep moving left to stay in the game and eventually reach the apples on the left side of the board.\n*   **Space Management:** Moving LEFT along the top row (y=9) is the cleanest path. It minimizes the risk of getting trapped by my own body and keeps me far from Snake 0 for the time being.\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to (7, 9). Continue moving left to navigate toward the cluster of apples at the bottom left (0,1), (0,2) while monitoring Snake 0's path toward (3,9) and (2,8).\n\nLEFT",

Even though the body moves, (5, 8) will become (4, 8), but (5, 8) is still occupied by the enemy snake's body until the move is complete.\n\n**Strategy and Risks:**\n*   Snake #0 is at (2, 8). One apple is at (3, 9). If Snake #0 moves UP-RIGHT or RIGHT-UP, it can intercept me.\n*   However, I am currently \"above\" the enemy. My tail is wrapping around the right side and bottom. \n*   If I move LEFT to (4, 9), I am one step away from the apple at (3, 9). \n*   If Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 9), it is also one step away from (3, 9).\n*   If we both move to (3, 9) on the same turn (Turn 39), we both die.\n*   The square (5, 8) is Snake #0's body. I cannot move DOWN.\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to (4, 9). I must monitor Snake #0's position. If it moves to (2, 9) or (3, 8) next turn, I must be careful about a head-on collision at (3, 9). My advantage is size and score; my goal is to continue collecting apples while maintaining a path toward the bottom-left cluster where more apples are available.\n\nLEFT",

My body is [(5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)].\n*   **Snake #0 (Enemy):** Head is at (2, 9). Body is [(2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8)].\n*   **Apples:** (3, 9), (5, 7), (0, 1), (0, 2), (9, 1).\n\n**Movement Options from (4, 9):**\n1.  **LEFT (3, 9):** This is where an apple is located. However, the enemy snake's head is at (2, 9). If Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (3, 9) this turn, we will have a **head-on collision** and both die. Given I am leading 11 to 4, a double-death results in my victory (highest score), but it is safer to stay alive if possible.\n2.  **RIGHT (5, 9):** **INVALID.** This is my neck/body.\n3.  **UP (4, 10):** **INVALID.** Out of bounds.\n4.  **DOWN (4, 8):** **INVALID.** This is Snake #0's body. Even though their tail moves, (4, 8) is currently occupied.\n\n**Detailed Evaluation:**\n*   Snake #0 is at (2, 9). Its only safe moves are DOWN to (2, 8) - which is its own body, but the tail moves, so it *might* be legal depending on length/growth, but actually, its neck is at (2,8), so it can't move DOWN. It can't move UP (out of bounds). It can move LEFT to (1, 9) or RIGHT to (3, 9).\n*   If I move LEFT to (3, 9), I risk the collision.\n*   Wait, looking at the board: Snake #0's head is at (2, 9). Its body is [(2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8)].\n*   Snake #0's neck is at (2, 8). It cannot move DOWN. It cannot move UP. It can only move LEFT (1, 9) or RIGHT (3, 9).\n*   If I move LEFT, and it moves RIGHT, we both die at (3, 9).\n*   However, if I don't move LEFT, I have no legal moves. UP is wall, DOWN is enemy body (4,8), RIGHT is my body (5,9). \n\n**Conclusion:** I have no choice. (4, 8) is an enemy body segment. (4, 10) is a wall. (5, 9) is my body. (3, 9) is the only square. I must move LEFT and hope Snake #0 moves LEFT or that the resulting double-death awards me the win.\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to (3, 9). If Snake #0 moves RIGHT, the game ends in my favor due to higher apple count. If it moves LEFT, I survive and take the apple.\n\nLEFT",

However, in Snake, when a snake moves, the tail cell becomes vacant unless the snake grows. Snake #0 did not grow. Its tail is (4, 8).\nIt seems I am trapped. My only hope is to move into a space that *becomes* vacant or to outscore if I die. Since I have 12 apples and the opponent has 4, if I die now and the game ends, I win.\n\nDOWN",
