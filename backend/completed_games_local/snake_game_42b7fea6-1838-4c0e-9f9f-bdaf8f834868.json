There are apples at (9,5), (1,9), (7,3), (8,6), (5,4).\n\nFirst, check all four moves for immediate death:\n\n- **UP**: (4,9) \u2013 within board bounds (0-9). No snakes there currently. Safe.\n- **DOWN**: (4,7) \u2013 within bounds. No snakes there. Safe.\n- **LEFT**: (3,8) \u2013 within bounds. No snakes there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT**: (5,8) \u2013 within bounds. No snakes there. Safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe immediately. Now consider enemy snake #0 at (2,0). It's far away, so no immediate collision risk this turn.\n\nNow think about apple proximity and future options:\n\n- Apple at (1,9) is at top-left corner. From my position (4,8), moving LEFT gets me closer horizontally, but I'd need to go up to y=9 eventually.\n- Apple at (9,5) is far right-middle. That's quite a distance.\n- Apple at (7,3) is lower right.\n- Apple at (8,6) is right and down a bit.\n- Apple at (5,4) is directly below me to the right.\n\nThe closest apple by Manhattan distance:\n- To (1,9): |4-1|+|8-9| = 3+1=4\n- To (9,5): |4-9|+|8-5| = 5+3=8\n- To (7,3): |4-7|+|8-3| = 3+5=8\n- To (8,6): |4-8|+|8-6| = 4+2=6\n- To (5,4): |4-5|+|8-4| = 1+4=5\n\nClosest is (1,9) at distance 4, then (5,4) at 5, then (8,6) at 6.\n\nBut (1,9) requires moving left and up. Since I'm at y=8, moving UP to (4,9) puts me one step closer to (1,9) vertically, but horizontally I'd still need to move left 3. Moving LEFT to (3,8) gets me closer horizontally but vertically still 1 away.\n\nConsider future safe moves: from (4,8):\n- If I go UP to (4,9): next moves possible are LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN (not UP because that's off board). That's 3 options.\n- If I go DOWN to (4,7): next moves possible are UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. All 4 directions safe (assuming no enemy moves into those cells). Good options.\n- If I go LEFT to (3,8): next moves possible are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. All 4 directions safe.\n- If I go RIGHT to (5,8): next moves possible are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. All 4 safe.\n\nAll give good future options. But I should think about the enemy snake #0 at (2,0). It might move toward apples too, but it's far away.\n\nGiven the closest apple is (1,9), moving LEFT reduces horizontal distance from 3 to 2. Moving UP reduces vertical distance from 1 to 0 (but then I'd be at y=9, and apple is at y=9 too). Actually, apple (1,9) is at y=9, so moving UP puts me at same y-level, which is good.\n\nBut moving UP puts me at (4,9). From there, to reach (1,9) I'd need to go LEFT three times. That path might be safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (3,8) then UP to (3,9) then LEFT twice to (1,9) also works.\n\nI think moving LEFT is slightly better because it reduces both x and y distance? Wait, from (4,8) to (1,9): \u0394x=-3, \u0394y=+1. Moving LEFT reduces \u0394x to -2, \u0394y still +1. Moving UP reduces \u0394x to -3, \u0394y to 0.\n\nI'll choose LEFT to start moving toward the closest apple while keeping many future options.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Head toward apple at (1,9) via leftward movement, but watch for enemy snake #0 possibly moving up. Avoid trapping myself in top-left corner.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy snake #0 is at (3,1), far away.\n\nFirst, check each move for immediate death:\n- **UP** to (2,9): Within board. No snake body there. Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (2,7): Within board. No snake body there. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (1,8): Within board. No snake body there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (3,8): Within board. No snake body there. Safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe this turn.\n\nNow consider enemy movement. Enemy head at (3,1) could move UP to (3,2), DOWN to (3,0), LEFT to (2,1), or RIGHT to (4,1). None of these threaten my immediate move destinations, as I'm far away. No head-on collision risk this turn.\n\nNow evaluate moves toward apples. Apples at: (9,5), (1,9), (7,3), (8,6), (5,4).\n\nClosest apple by Manhattan distance:\n- To (1,9): distance = |2-1|+|8-9| = 1+1=2\n- To (5,4): distance = |2-5|+|8-4| = 3+4=7\n- Others are farther.\n\nThe apple at (1,9) is very close. Moving LEFT to (1,8) gets me directly below it (distance 1). Moving UP to (2,9) gets me to the right of it (distance 1). Both are good.\n\nBut moving UP to (2,9) puts me on the top edge, reducing my future moves to three (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN). Moving LEFT to (1,8) keeps me off edges, preserving all four directions next turn. That's better for flexibility.\n\nAlso, moving LEFT positions me to potentially eat the apple next turn by moving UP to (1,9). However, I should consider if moving UP first might be safer? Let's think: If I move UP to (2,9), then next turn I could move LEFT to (1,9) to eat. But after eating at (1,9), I'd be at the top-left corner with my new body segment at (2,9) behind me. From (1,9), my only safe exit would be DOWN to (1,8), because RIGHT would go into my new body at (2,9). That's okay.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,8) this turn, then next turn I can move UP to (1,9) to eat. After eating, my new body segment will be at (1,8). From (1,9), my only safe exit would be DOWN to (1,8) but that's my new body\u2014so actually that's illegal. Wait, moving DOWN from (1,9) after eating would go into the new body segment at (1,8), which would kill me. So from (1,9) after eating, my only safe move might be RIGHT to (2,9), if that cell is free. Let's check: After eating at (1,9), my body will be [head at (1,9), tail at (1,8)]. So moving RIGHT to (2,9) is safe if that cell is empty. It likely will be.\n\nSo both approaches seem viable. However, moving LEFT now gives me more options next turn before eating: from (1,8) I could also move DOWN if needed, whereas from (2,9) I couldn't move DOWN (off board). So LEFT seems slightly better for maintaining optionality.\n\nConsider other apples: After eating (1,9), the next closest might be (5,4) or (7,3). I'll need to plan an exit from the top-left area.\n\nAlso, I should be aware of enemy snake #0. It might be heading toward apples too, but currently not a threat.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move LEFT to (1,8). Next turn, if safe, move UP to (1,9) to eat the apple. After eating, exit via RIGHT to (2,9) if possible, then head south/southeast toward the central apples.\n\nLEFT",

They could move DOWN to (1,7), LEFT to (0,8), RIGHT to (2,8), or UP to (1,9) where there's an apple. The UP move to (1,9) is most likely since it gets them an apple.\n\n**Apple Prioritization:**\nThe closest apple is at (5,4) - 3 moves away. Other apples: (7,3), (8,6), (9,5), (1,9). Snake #1 is likely heading for (1,9), so I should focus on the central/right apples.\n\n**Optimal Path:**\n- UP to (3,3): Good positioning toward (5,4) and (7,3)\n- RIGHT to (4,2): Also moves toward (5,4) but slightly less direct\n- LEFT/DOWN move me away from the apple cluster\n\n**Future Mobility:**\nUP gives me good options - I can then go RIGHT to (4,3) or continue UP.

Apples at: (9,5), (1,9), (7,3), (8,6), (5,4).\n\nFirst, check immediate safety for each possible move from (1,8):\n- **UP** to (1,9): Within board (0-9). No snake body there currently. Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (1,7): Within board. No snake body there. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (0,8): Within board. No snake body there. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,8): Within board. No snake body there. Safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe from immediate self-collision or board boundaries.\n\nNow consider enemy movement: Enemy head at (3,2) could move UP to (3,3), DOWN to (3,1), LEFT to (2,2), or RIGHT to (4,2). None of these squares are my potential move destinations, which are all in row 8 or 9. So no immediate threat of head-on collision or moving into its future body.\n\nNow evaluate apples: The closest apple is at (1,9) directly above me (Manhattan distance = 1). Moving UP this turn would eat it immediately, growing to length 2 and scoring my first apple. That's highly advantageous.\n\nConsider follow-up safety after eating: If I move UP to (1,9) and eat, my new body will be: head at (1,9), tail at (1,8). Next turn, from (1,9), my possible moves:\n- UP to (1,10): off board (invalid).\n- DOWN to (1,8): would collide with my own new body segment (tail) \u2013 illegal.\n- LEFT to (0,9): within board, currently empty.\n- RIGHT to (2,9): within board, currently empty.\n\nSo after eating, I'd have two safe exits: LEFT or RIGHT. That's acceptable. I can then plan to move away from the edge.\n\nIf I don't eat now and move elsewhere (e.g., LEFT to (0,8) or RIGHT to (2,8)), I'd still be one step away from the apple but give the enemy a chance to possibly move toward it. Since enemy is far away at (3,2), immediate competition for (1,9) is low, but securing the apple now is optimal.\n\nLong-term plan after eating: After moving UP to (1,9) and eating, I'll have length 2. Next turn, I should choose either LEFT to (0,9) or RIGHT to (2,9) based on safety and proximity to other apples. From there, aim for central apples like (5,4) or (7,3), while avoiding potential traps near edges.\n\nGiven the clear immediate gain and safety of UP, that's the best move.\n\nUP",

None of these squares are my potential move destinations (0,9) or (2,9). So no immediate threat of head-on collision or moving into its future body.\n\nNow evaluate apples: The closest apple in Manhattan distance from (1,9):\n- (5,4): distance = |1-5| + |9-4| = 4+5 = 9\n- (7,3): 6+6 = 12\n- (8,6): 7+3 = 10\n- (9,5): 8+4 = 12\n- (6,0): 5+9 = 14\n\nAll are far. No apple is adjacent.\n\nConsider follow-up safety after each safe move:\n- **LEFT to (0,9)**: Next turn from (0,9), possible moves:\n    - UP to (0,10): off board.\n    - DOWN to (0,8): within board, currently empty.\n    - LEFT to (-1,9): off board.\n    - RIGHT to (1,9): would be my current head position, but my tail will move? Wait: After moving LEFT, my body will be: head at (0,9), tail at (1,8) will move forward? Actually, since I didn't eat an apple, my snake moves: head to new cell, each body segment shifts forward, tail moves off old tail position. So next turn, my body will be: head at (0,9), body segment at (1,9) (since tail moved from (1,8) to (1,9)? Let's simulate: Current body: head (1,9), tail (1,8). Move LEFT: new head (0,9). Body segment shifts: old head (1,9) becomes first body segment. Tail (1,8) is removed because no growth. So new body: [(0,9), (1,9)]. So next turn from (0,9), moving RIGHT to (1,9) would collide with my own body segment \u2192 invalid. So from (0,9), safe moves would be DOWN only (to (0,8)). That's a dead-end (only one safe exit). Risky.\n- **RIGHT to (2,9)**: Next turn from (2,9), body will be: head (2,9), body segment (1,9). Possible moves:\n    - UP to (2,10): off board.\n    - DOWN to (2,8): within board, currently empty.\n    - LEFT to (1,9): would collide with my body segment \u2192 invalid.\n    - RIGHT to (3,9): within board, empty.\nSo from (2,9), safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT. Two safe exits, better.\n\nThus RIGHT gives more future flexibility. Also, moving RIGHT heads toward the center of the board where more apples are located. LEFT moves to edge and limits options.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving RIGHT to (2,9), next turn I'll have two safe moves: DOWN to (2,8) or RIGHT to (3,9). I should aim to gradually move toward the cluster of apples around columns 5-9, rows 0-6, while avoiding getting trapped near edges. Keep an eye on enemy movement; enemy is currently far away in lower left.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (2,9), consider moving DOWN to (2,8) to start descending toward apples, then possibly RIGHT/DOWN toward (5,4) or (7,3). Avoid getting pinned against top edge.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait: if my head is at (2,8) and my only body segment is at (2,9), that means my tail is above my head, so I'm currently moving DOWN? Let's trace: coordinate lists are head-to-tail. Head is (2,8), next segment is (2,9). So the body extends upward from head. That means I'm moving UP? Actually, if head is at (2,8) and next segment is at (2,9), that's north (up). So my current direction is UP. My last move was DOWN, but that might have been from previous turn? Let's check: last turn I moved DOWN, so my head moved from somewhere to (2,8). If I moved DOWN to (2,8), my previous head was at (2,9)? That would make sense: I was at (2,9), moved DOWN to (2,8), so my body now has segment at (2,9) behind me. So my current direction is DOWN? Wait, direction is inferred from head and neck: neck is at (2,9), head at (2,8), so neck is north of head, meaning I'm moving SOUTH (DOWN). Yes, that's consistent: I moved DOWN last turn, so my neck is behind me at (2,9). So I'm currently moving DOWN.\n\nNow evaluate possible moves:\n\n1. UP: to (2,9). That's my own body segment at (2,9) \u2014 would die (self-collision). So UP is invalid.\n\n2. DOWN: to (2,7). That's empty on board. Check for enemy body: Snake #0 head at (5,3), body none. So DOWN seems safe.\n\n3. LEFT: to (1,8). Empty. Safe.\n\n4. RIGHT: to (3,8). Empty. Safe.\n\nSo UP is eliminated. DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\nNow consider apples: apples at (9,5), (7,3), (8,6), (5,4), (6,0). Closest apples? My position (2,8). Manhattan distances:\n- (9,5): |2-9|+|8-5| = 7+3=10\n- (7,3): |2-7|+|8-3| =5+5=10\n- (8,6): |2-8|+|8-6| =6+2=8\n- (5,4): |2-5|+|8-4| =3+4=7\n- (6,0): |2-6|+|8-0| =4+8=12\n\nClosest is (5,4) distance 7. But need to consider reachability and enemy positions.\n\nEnemy snake #0 at (5,3) with no body. It might move towards apple at (5,4) or (7,3) etc.\n\nMy possible moves:\n- DOWN to (2,7): moves away from most apples except (6,0) far south.\n- LEFT to (1,8): moves west, not closer to any apple really.\n- RIGHT to (3,8): moves east, slightly closer to (5,4) and others.\n\nRIGHT seems best for approaching apples. But need to consider future safe moves: from (3,8), I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT? UP to (3,9) is empty, DOWN to (3,7) empty, LEFT back to (2,8) but that's my previous head position \u2014 is that allowed? Yes, it's empty now because I moved away. But careful: if I move RIGHT now to (3,8), my body will be at (2,8) and (2,9)? Actually after moving, my new head at (3,8), my body becomes [(2,8), (2,9)]? Wait, growth? I have apples collected: 1, meaning I've eaten one apple earlier. My length should be 2 (head + one body segment). Yes, my body is [(2,9)] only. So after moving without eating, my tail will disappear? Actually snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment shifts forward, tail is removed unless growing from eating apple. Since I didn't eat apple this turn, my tail (2,9) will disappear, and my body becomes [(2,8)]? Let's think: current: head (2,8), body [(2,9)]. After moving RIGHT to (3,8): new head at (3,8), old head becomes first body segment at (2,8), old body segment (2,9) becomes tail? Actually shift: body becomes [(2,8), (2,9)] then tail (2,9) removed because no growth. So final body: [(2,8)] only. So my new body will be just (2,8). So from (3,8), my neck is at (2,8). So moving LEFT from (3,8) would go back to (2,8) which is my own body \u2014 that would be suicide. So from (3,8), LEFT is not safe because it's my own body behind me. That reduces future options.\n\nCheck DOWN from (3,8): to (3,7) empty.\nUP from (3,8): to (3,9) empty.\nRIGHT from (3,8): to (4,8) empty.\nSo from (3,8), three safe moves except LEFT.\n\nNow consider LEFT move to (1,8): from there, my body will be [(2,8)]? Actually after moving LEFT: head to (1,8), old head (2,8) becomes body, tail (2,9) removed. So body is [(2,8)]. From (1,8), neck at (2,8). So moving RIGHT back to (2,8) would be suicide. So from (1,8), safe moves: UP (1,9), DOWN (1,7), LEFT (0,8). Three safe moves.\n\nDOWN move to (2,7): from there, body becomes [(2,8)]? Wait: head to (2,7), old head (2,8) becomes body, tail removed. So body is [(2,8)]. From (2,7), neck at (2,8) above. So moving UP back to (2,8) would be suicide. Safe moves: DOWN (2,6), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7). Three safe moves.\n\nAll three safe moves give three safe follow-ups. But which is best for apples? RIGHT moves towards (5,4) etc. DOWN moves towards (6,0) but that's far and not efficient. LEFT moves away from apples.\n\nAlso consider enemy snake #0 at (5,3). It might move towards apple at (5,4) which is adjacent. Possible moves for it: UP to (5,4) eats apple, DOWN to (5,2), LEFT to (4,3), RIGHT to (6,3). It will likely go UP to eat apple. That apple might be gone soon.\n\nOther apples: (7,3) close to enemy? (8,6) north-east, (9,5) far east.\n\nI should maybe go towards (8,6) or (7,3)? From my position, going RIGHT then RIGHT again etc.\n\nBut also need to avoid head-on collisions: enemy head at (5,3). If I move RIGHT repeatedly, we might meet later but not this turn.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to (3,8) to start heading east towards apples. Next turn, I can go RIGHT again to (4,8), then DOWN to (4,7) etc. towards (5,4) or (7,3). But apple at (5,4) might be eaten by snake #0 this turn. If snake #0 moves UP to (5,4), it will grow and its body will be at (5,3) behind. Then apple disappears and respawns elsewhere.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should go DOWN to (2,7) to go south towards apple at (6,0)? That's far and not efficient.\n\nBetter to go RIGHT and then perhaps DOWN later.\n\nAlso consider board edges: I'm near west edge at x=2, going LEFT to x=1 is safe, but going to x=0 next might limit.\n\nI think RIGHT is best.\n\nLet's check if any immediate head-on collision risk: enemy at (5,3) moving? It could move UP to (5,4), LEFT to (4,3), DOWN to (5,2), RIGHT to (6,3). No chance of meeting me this turn since I'm at (2,8).\n\nSo safe.\n\nI'll choose RIGHT.\n\nPlan for next turns: Head east towards central apples, avoid trapping myself. Keep an eye on enemy #0's position and possible growth.\n\nRIGHT",

This puts me directly on the apple, giving me +1 point and growing my snake. This apple is strategically valuable as it's close and uncontested by the enemy snake.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nSnake #1 is at (5,8) with body at (4,8). They're still distant in the upper left quadrant, so no immediate collision threat. Moving RIGHT places me further from their current position.\n\n**Path Planning:**\nAfter eating the apple at (7,3), I'll be at (7,3) with body segments at (6,3) and (6,4). This gives me flexibility to move UP, DOWN, or LEFT next turn while avoiding the wall on the right.\n\n**Strategic Next Steps:**\nAfter eating this apple, I should assess the remaining apple distribution.

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the board state.\n\n**Current position and safe moves:**\n- My head: (5,8)\n- My body: [(4,8)] (tail at (4,8))\n- Apples: (9,5), (7,3), (8,6), (6,0), (6,8)\n- Enemy snake #0: head at (6,3), body [(6,4)]\n\n**Check each direction for immediate death:**\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (5,9): within board (0\u20139), not my body, not enemy body. Safe.\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (5,7): within board, not my body, not enemy body. Safe.\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (4,8): this is my own tail (4,8). Moving into your own body kills you, even if it's the tail cell? Wait\u2014the tail will move forward if I don't eat an apple. Since I haven't eaten this turn, my tail at (4,8) will remain there after I move? Actually: simultaneous movement means my head moves first, then my body follows. But if my head moves into (4,8), that's currently occupied by my tail. Since I'm not eating this turn, the tail will stay at (4,8) until after movement? No\u2014rules: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment.\" I'm not on an apple now, so my tail will move forward (the segment at (4,8) will shift to where the head was? Actually in Snake, when you move without eating, the tail follows the head's previous path, so the cell (4,8) becomes empty after the move. But the movement is simultaneous: at the start of the turn, (4,8) is occupied by my tail. If I move LEFT into (4,8), that's moving into a cell occupied by my own body at the start of the turn\u2014that kills me. So LEFT is unsafe.\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,8): within board, not my body, not enemy body. It's an apple location\u2014so if I move RIGHT, I'll eat the apple and grow. That means my tail won't move this turn (it stays in place, and a new segment is added at the head's previous position after movement). So moving RIGHT is safe and gets an apple.\n\n**Enemy possible moves and collision risk:**\nEnemy head at (6,3), body at (6,4). Its possible moves: UP to (6,4)? That's its own body\u2014so not allowed. DOWN to (6,2), LEFT to (5,3), RIGHT to (7,3) (apple there). It cannot move UP into its own body. So enemy could move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nCould enemy move to (6,8) same turn as me? No, too far: Manhattan distance from (6,3) to (6,8) is 5, impossible in one move.\n\nCould enemy move to (5,8) (my current head) and cause head-on collision? From (6,3) to (5,8) is distance 6, impossible.\n\nCould enemy move to (6,7) or (5,7) etc.? Possibly, but no immediate head-on collision threat to my considered moves.\n\n**Check safe follow-up moves after each option:**\n\n- **RIGHT** to (6,8): eat apple \u2192 length becomes 3 (head at (6,8), body: (5,8) becomes new segment, tail stays at (4,8)? Actually after eating, new head at (6,8), old head (5,8) becomes body segment, tail stays at (4,8) \u2014 so body: [(6,8), (5,8), (4,8)]. Next turn from (6,8): possible moves UP (6,9), DOWN (6,7), LEFT (5,8) \u2014 but (5,8) will be my body next turn, so LEFT is unsafe. RIGHT (7,8) is empty. So 3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good.\n\n- **UP** to (5,9): no apple. Next turn from (5,9): possible moves DOWN (back to (5,8)), LEFT (4,9), RIGHT (6,9). All within board. (5,8) will be empty if I move UP? Actually my body segment at (5,8) moves to (4,8)? Wait, no apple eaten, so tail moves: my tail at (4,8) moves to (5,8)? Actually: head moves to (5,9), neck becomes (5,8), tail (4,8) disappears, new tail is at (5,8)? Let's simulate: start body: [(5,8),(4,8)]. Move UP without eating: new head (5,9), body becomes [(5,9),(5,8)], tail (4,8) is removed. So next turn from (5,9), DOWN to (5,8) is safe because (5,8) is my body but will it be there? At start of next turn, my body is [(5,9),(5,8)], so (5,8) is occupied. So DOWN would be moving into own body\u2014unsafe. So from (5,9), safe moves: LEFT (4,9), RIGHT (6,9). Only 2 safe moves. Less flexible.\n\n- **DOWN** to (5,7): no apple. Next turn from (5,7): possible moves UP (back to (5,8)), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7). (5,8) will be empty after move? Let's simulate: start body [(5,8),(4,8)], move DOWN to (5,7) without eating \u2192 new body [(5,7),(5,8)], tail removed. So next turn, UP to (5,8) is safe because (5,8) is empty at start of next turn? Wait, at start of next turn my body is [(5,7),(5,8)], so (5,8) is occupied. So UP is unsafe. So safe moves: LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7). Only 2 safe moves.\n\nThus RIGHT gives more future mobility and gets an apple.\n\n**Long-term plan after this turn:**\nAfter eating apple at (6,8), length 3. Next turn: avoid moving LEFT into (5,8) (own body). Consider moving toward another apple, maybe (8,6) or (9,5), while keeping space open. Monitor enemy movement\u2014enemy might be heading toward (7,3) apple. We have apple lead (2 vs 1) if we eat this one.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT is safe, gets apple, maintains good future options.\n\nRIGHT",

They're still distant and focused on the top-left quadrant. They're closer to the apple at (0,1) but that's far from my position.\n\n**Strategic Planning for Next Few Turns:**\nI should target the cluster of apples at (8,6) and (9,5) on the right side. This gives me a clear path: UP to (7,4), then RIGHT to (8,4), then UP to (8,5), then RIGHT to (9,5) for the apple. After that, I can easily get to (8,6).

Not occupied by my body [(5,8),(4,8)] or enemy body [(6,3),(6,4)]. Safe.\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (6,7): Within board. Not occupied by my body or enemy body. Safe.\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (5,8): This is currently my own body segment (5,8). Since I'm not eating an apple this turn (no apple at (5,8)), my tail will move forward, but simultaneous movement means at the start of the turn (5,8) is occupied by my body. Moving into it would kill me. Unsafe.\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,8): Within board. Not occupied by my body or enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy possible moves and collision risk:**\nEnemy head at (7,3). Its body at (6,3) and (6,4). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (7,4): empty.\n- DOWN to (7,2): empty.\n- LEFT to (6,3): its own body \u2014 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (8,3): empty.\n\nSo enemy can move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. Could it move into (6,8), (6,7), or (7,8) this turn? Manhattan distances:\n- To (6,8): |7-6|+|3-8| = 1+5=6 \u2192 impossible.\n- To (6,7): |7-6|+|3-7| = 1+4=5 \u2192 impossible.\n- To (7,8): |7-7|+|3-8| = 0+5=5 \u2192 impossible.\n\nSo no immediate head-on collision threat to my considered moves this turn.\n\n**Evaluate safe moves:**\n\n- **RIGHT to (7,8)**: No apple there. Next turn from (7,8): possible moves UP (7,9), DOWN (7,7), LEFT (6,8), RIGHT (8,8). All within board. My body next turn (if no apple eaten): head at (7,8), body becomes [(6,8),(5,8)], tail (4,8) disappears. So (6,8) will be my body segment. So LEFT to (6,8) would be unsafe next turn. That leaves UP, DOWN, RIGHT as safe next turn (3 options). Good mobility.\n\n- **UP to (6,9)**: No apple. Next turn from (6,9): possible moves DOWN (6,8), LEFT (5,9), RIGHT (7,9). My body next turn: [(6,9),(6,8),(5,8)]? Wait, simulate: start body [(6,8),(5,8),(4,8)], move UP without eating \u2192 new head (6,9), body becomes [(6,9),(6,8),(5,8)], tail (4,8) removed. So (6,8) is my body next turn. DOWN to (6,8) would be unsafe. So safe moves: LEFT (5,9), RIGHT (7,9). Only 2 safe moves.\n\n- **DOWN to (6,7)**: No apple. Next turn from (6,7): possible moves UP (6,8), LEFT (5,7), RIGHT (7,7). My body next turn: [(6,7),(6,8),(5,8)] (tail removed). So UP to (6,8) is unsafe (own body). Safe moves: LEFT (5,7), RIGHT (7,7). Only 2 safe moves.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\nApples at: (9,5), (8,6), (6,0), (9,0), (0,1).\nFrom my head (6,8):\n- To (9,5): distance 6\n- To (8,6): distance 4\n- To (6,0): distance 8\n- To (9,0): distance 11\n- To (0,1): distance 13\n\nClosest apple is (8,6) with Manhattan distance 4. Moving RIGHT to (7,8) gets me closer to (8,6) (distance from (7,8) to (8,6) is 3). Moving UP to (6,9) increases distance to (8,6) to 5. Moving DOWN to (6,7) also increases distance (to 5). So RIGHT is best for approaching the nearest apple.\n\n**Enemy movement consideration:**\nEnemy might go for apple at (7,3) or (8,6)? Apple at (7,3) is right next to enemy head, but it's not listed? Wait, the apples listed are (9,5), (8,6), (6,0), (9,0), (0,1). So (7,3) is not an apple. Enemy might move toward (8,6) as well, but from (7,3) to (8,6) distance is 4, same as my distance. But I'm currently at (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8) puts me 3 away from (8,6), while enemy from (7,3) would be 4 away if it moves RIGHT to (8,3) then UP etc. I have a slight advantage.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (7,8), next turn consider moving toward (8,6) via RIGHT to (8,8) then DOWN, or DOWN to (7,7) then RIGHT. Monitor enemy movement\u2014they may also head toward (8,6). Avoid potential head-on collisions by not moving into cells enemy could reach same turn. Keep multiple safe moves open.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT is safe, maintains good future mobility, and moves me closer to the nearest apple.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy possible moves and head-on collision risk.**\n\nEnemy head at (7,5). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (7,6): empty.\n- DOWN to (7,4): its own body \u2014 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (6,5): empty.\n- RIGHT to (8,5): empty.\n\nSo enemy can move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Could it move into (8,9), (8,7), or (9,8) this turn? Manhattan distances:\n- To (8,9): |7-8|+|5-9| = 1+4=5 \u2192 impossible.\n- To (8,7): |7-8|+|5-7| = 1+2=3 \u2192 possible if enemy moves RIGHT then DOWN? No, only one move. Enemy cannot reach (8,7) in one move.\n- To (9,8): |7-9|+|5-8| = 2+3=5 \u2192 impossible.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision threat to my safe moves this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for future mobility and apple proximity.**\n\n- **UP to (8,9)**: No apple. Next turn from (8,9): possible moves DOWN (8,8), LEFT (7,9), RIGHT (9,9). My body next turn (if no apple eaten): head at (8,9), body becomes [(8,9),(8,8),(7,8)], tail (6,8) disappears. So DOWN to (8,8) would be unsafe (own body). Safe moves: LEFT (7,9), RIGHT (9,9). Only 2 safe moves.\n\n- **DOWN to (8,7)**: No apple. Next turn from (8,7): possible moves UP (8,8), LEFT (7,7), RIGHT (9,7). My body next turn: [(8,7),(8,8),(7,8)] (tail removed). So UP to (8,8) is unsafe (own body). Safe moves: LEFT (7,7), RIGHT (9,7). Only 2 safe moves.\n\n- **RIGHT to (9,8)**: No apple. Next turn from (9,8): possible moves UP (9,9), DOWN (9,7), LEFT (8,8). My body next turn: [(9,8),(8,8),(7,8)] (tail removed). So LEFT to (8,8) would be unsafe. That leaves UP (9,9) and DOWN (9,7) as safe next turn (2 options). Mobility similar to UP/DOWN.\n\nApple proximity from my head (8,8):\n- To (9,5): distance |8-9|+|8-5| = 1+3=4\n- To (8,6): distance |8-8|+|8-6| = 0+2=2\n- To (6,0): distance 10\n- To (9,0): distance 9\n- To (0,1): distance 15\n\nClosest apple is (8,6) with Manhattan distance 2. Moving DOWN to (8,7) gets me to distance 1 from (8,6). Moving RIGHT to (9,8) gets me to distance 3 from (8,6). Moving UP to (8,9) increases distance to 3.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement toward apples.**\n\nEnemy might head for (8,6) as well. From (7,5), distance to (8,6) is 2. Enemy could move UP to (7,6) (distance to apple becomes 2), then RIGHT to (8,6) next turn. If I move DOWN to (8,7), I could move DOWN to (8,6) next turn. That could result in a head-on collision if we both move to (8,6) simultaneously on turn 13. However, if enemy moves UP to (7,6) this turn, I'd see that next turn and could avoid moving into (8,6) if enemy is adjacent. Moving DOWN now puts me one step away from the apple, but I should monitor enemy position next turn before committing.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:** After moving DOWN to (8,7), next turn I'll be adjacent to apple (8,6) and enemy might be at (7,6). I'll need to check if moving DOWN into (8,6) is safe (no enemy head entering same cell). If enemy is at (7,6), it could also move RIGHT to (8,6), causing head-on collision if I move there. So next turn I might need to choose LEFT or RIGHT instead to stay safe and let enemy possibly take the apple, then target another apple. The apple at (9,5) is also relatively close. Moving RIGHT to (9,8) positions me farther from (8,6) but opens a path toward (9,5) via DOWN/LEFT later.\n\nGiven my last move was RIGHT, continuing RIGHT might lead me toward the edge. DOWN seems best for apple proximity and maintains options (LEFT/RIGHT next turn from (8,7)). However, from (8,7), LEFT and RIGHT are safe next turn, but UP is blocked by my body. That's still 2 safe moves, same as other options. The key advantage of DOWN is it puts me closest to the nearest apple.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN is safe, minimizes distance to the nearest apple (8,6), and maintains reasonable future mobility. I'll proceed cautiously next turn to avoid head-on collision if enemy also approaches.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "**Analysis of current board state:**\n\nMy snake (ID 1) is at head (7,7) with body [(8,7), (8,8)].\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (9,5) with body [(8,5), (7,5), (7,4)].\n\nApples at: (8,6), (6,0), (9,0), (0,1), (3,0).\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Check each direction for immediate death:**\n\n*   **UP** \u2192 (7,8). Check: Within board? Yes (y=8). Into my body? My body cells are (8,7) and (8,8). (7,8) is not in that list. Into enemy body? Enemy body cells are (8,5), (7,5), (7,4). (7,8) not there. **Safe**.\n*   **DOWN** \u2192 (7,6). Within board? Yes (y=6). Into my body? No. Into enemy body? No. **Safe**.\n*   **LEFT** \u2192 (6,7). Within board? Yes (x=6). Into my body? No. Into enemy body? No. **Safe**.\n*   **RIGHT** \u2192 (8,7). Within board? Yes (x=8). Into my body? My body cell (8,7) is directly to the right. Moving RIGHT would hit my own body segment. **DEADLY**.\n\nSo RIGHT is eliminated.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy head movement and potential head-on collisions:**\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (9,5). Its possible moves:\n*   UP \u2192 (9,6) \u2013 safe for them? Within board, not into their body [(8,5),(7,5),(7,4)], not into my body.\n*   DOWN \u2192 (9,4) \u2013 safe? Within board, not into their body, not into my body.\n*   LEFT \u2192 (8,5) \u2013 safe? That's their own body segment (8,5) \u2013 **DEADLY for them**.\n*   RIGHT \u2192 Off board (x=10) \u2013 **DEADLY for them**.\n\nSo enemy's only safe moves are UP and DOWN. They are likely to choose one that gets them toward apples. Apple at (8,6) is close. UP to (9,6) moves them closer to (8,6) (distance 2) than DOWN to (9,4) (distance 4). They might choose UP.\n\nIf enemy moves UP to (9,6), that cell is not in my path for any of my safe moves.\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (9,4), also not in my path.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk with my safe moves (UP to (7,8), DOWN to (7,6), LEFT to (6,7)).\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Evaluate safe moves for future options and apple proximity:**\n\n*   **UP (7,8)**: From there, possible next moves: UP to (7,9) \u2013 edge but safe if not occupied later; LEFT to (6,8); RIGHT to (8,8) \u2013 but (8,8) is my current tail, which will move if I don't eat an apple. Closest apple is (8,6) \u2013 distance from (7,8) is |8-7|+|6-8|=1+2=3.\n*   **DOWN (7,6)**: Next moves: DOWN to (7,5) \u2013 caution: enemy body at (7,5) currently, but if enemy moves, it might vacate? Not safe to assume. LEFT to (6,6); RIGHT to (8,6) \u2013 that's an apple! Apple (8,6) is adjacent RIGHT from (7,6). Distance to apple (8,6) from (7,6) is 1.\n*   **LEFT (6,7)**: Next moves: UP to (6,8); DOWN to (6,6); LEFT to (5,7). Closest apple is (8,6) \u2013 distance |8-6|+|6-7|=2+1=3.\n\nDOWN puts me adjacent to apple (8,6), which is highly desirable. However, need to check if moving to (7,6) itself is safe regarding enemy head movement: enemy at (9,5) cannot reach (7,6) in one move (only to (9,6) or (9,4)). So safe this turn.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Consider tail movement and future space:**\n\nMy tail is at (8,8). If I move and don't eat an apple, my tail will move away from (8,8) next turn (since body follows). That opens up cells behind me.\n\nMoving DOWN to (7,6) leaves my body as [(7,6), (7,7), (8,7)]? Wait, careful: After moving DOWN, new head at (7,6). Body becomes: head (7,6), then previous head (7,7), then (8,7), then tail (8,8) will be removed because no apple eaten. So new body: [(7,6), (7,7), (8,7)]. Tail is (8,7). That opens (8,8) completely.\n\nFrom (7,6), if I then go RIGHT to (8,6) next turn, I eat the apple and grow. Need to ensure (8,6) is safe next turn: It could be targeted by enemy if they move UP to (9,6) this turn, then LEFT to (8,6) next turn. That's a potential head-on collision risk if we both go for it simultaneously next turn. But I can decide next turn based on their position.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn:**\n\nPriority: Get apple at (8,6). From (7,6), if enemy head is at (9,6) (if they moved UP), they might also aim for (8,6). I could go LEFT to (6,6) to avoid collision and target other apples. If enemy head is elsewhere, going RIGHT to (8,6) is good. Also consider apple at (0,1) and (3,0) for later, but far. Apple at (6,0) is closer but need to navigate down left.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN gives me best immediate progress toward apple (8,6) while keeping multiple options open (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN next turn). It's safe this turn.\n\nDOWN",

Check: enemy body includes (7,5)? Yes, enemy snake #0's body includes (7,5). **DEADLY** (moving into enemy body).\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (6,6): Within board. Not my body [(7,7),(8,7)]. Not enemy body [(9,5),(8,5),(7,5)]. **SAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8,6): Within board. Contains an apple. Not my body. Not enemy body. **SAFE**.\n\nSo only **LEFT** and **RIGHT** are immediately safe.\n\n**Enemy head movement consideration:**  \nEnemy snake #0 head at (9,6). Its possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (9,7): Safe? Within board, not its body [(9,5),(8,5),(7,5)], not my body.\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,5): That's its own body segment. **DEADLY for them**.\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,6): Contains apple, not its body, not my body. **SAFE for them**.\n- RIGHT \u2192 Off board (x=10). **DEADLY**.\n\nSo enemy's safe moves are UP and LEFT. They are likely to go LEFT toward apple (8,6) since it's adjacent and they have 3 apples already (competitive). If they move LEFT to (8,6), that's exactly where I'm considering moving RIGHT.\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**  \nIf I move RIGHT to (8,6) and enemy moves LEFT to (8,6) simultaneously, we collide and both die. That's high risk because apple (8,6) is tempting for both.  \nIf I move LEFT to (6,6), enemy moving LEFT to (8,6) doesn't conflict.\n\n**Future options and apple proximity:**  \n- **RIGHT (8,6)**: Eats apple immediately, I grow to 4 segments. But high risk of head-on collision with enemy. Even if enemy chooses UP to (9,7), they could still target (8,6) next turn. After eating, my new head at (8,6), body: [(8,6),(7,6),(7,7),(8,7)]. Tail at (8,7). From (8,6), next moves: UP (8,7) is my new tail? Wait, tail is (8,7) after growth? Actually after eating, tail stays, so body becomes: head (8,6), then previous head (7,6), then (7,7), then (8,7) (tail). So UP to (8,7) would be into my own tail\u2014deadly unless tail moves because I eat again? No, tail only moves if no apple eaten. So UP would be unsafe. DOWN (8,5) is enemy body currently (but could change). LEFT (7,6) is my previous head\u2014safe? Actually (7,6) becomes my second segment after move, so moving LEFT back into my own body\u2014deadly. RIGHT (9,6) is off board? Actually x=9 is within board (0-9). (9,6) is currently empty. So from (8,6) after eating, only RIGHT to (9,6) might be safe, but that's risky if enemy is near.\n- **LEFT (6,6)**: No apple. Keeps me safe from immediate head-on. From (6,6), next moves: UP (6,7) is currently my body? My body after moving LEFT: head (6,6), then (7,6), (7,7), (8,7). So (6,7) is free. DOWN (6,5) free. LEFT (5,6) free. RIGHT (7,6) is my new second segment\u2014deadly. So from (6,6), UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe next turn. Closest apples: (8,6) distance 2, (6,0) distance 6, (3,0) distance 7, (0,1) distance 7, (9,0) distance 9. I could maneuver toward (6,0) or others later.\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nEnemy is at (9,6) with 3 apples vs my 2. They may aggressively go for (8,6). Avoid head-on collision. Moving LEFT to (6,6) keeps me safe and opens paths downward toward (6,0) or left toward (3,0)/(0,1). Let enemy take (8,6) if they want; I can target other apples while they might get trapped near edge. My tail at (8,7) will move next turn if I don't eat, opening (8,8) and (8,7) later.\n\nGiven the high risk of head-on collision at (8,6), the safer choice is **LEFT**.\n\n**Final move:** LEFT",

Contains my own body segment (second segment). **DEADLY** (moving into own body).\n\nSo **UP, DOWN, LEFT** are immediately safe.\n\n**Enemy head movement consideration:**  \nEnemy snake #0 head at (8,6). Its possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (8,7): Within board, not its body [(9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5)], not my body.\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,5): That's its own body segment (fourth segment). **DEADLY for them**.\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,6): Contains my body? My body after moving? Actually my current body includes (7,6) as my second segment. So moving LEFT into (7,6) would be into my body \u2013 deadly for them.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,6): That's its own body segment (second segment). **DEADLY for them**.\n\nSo enemy's only safe move is **UP** to (8,7). They cannot go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT without dying. Therefore, enemy will almost certainly move UP to (8,7) this turn.\n\n**Apple proximity and future options:**\n- **UP (6,7)**: No apple. Puts me at (6,7). From there, next moves: UP (6,8) free, DOWN (6,6) back to current head position (safe if tail moves?), LEFT (5,7) free, RIGHT (7,7) is my body (second segment's next position? Actually after I move UP, my body becomes: head (6,7), then (6,6), then (7,6), tail (7,7). So (7,7) is my tail \u2013 moving RIGHT into own tail would be deadly unless tail moves because I eat an apple this turn, which I won't. So RIGHT would be unsafe next turn.\n- **DOWN (6,5)**: No apple. Puts me at (6,5). From there: UP (6,6) back to current head, DOWN (6,4) free, LEFT (5,5) free, RIGHT (7,5) is enemy body (currently at (7,5) \u2013 but enemy is moving UP to (8,7), so (7,5) becomes tail? Actually enemy body: head (8,6), then (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), tail (7,5). If enemy moves UP to (8,7), their new body: head (8,7), then (8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), tail (7,5) stays? Wait, they didn't eat an apple, so their tail (7,5) will disappear next turn? Actually in Snake, if no apple eaten, the tail moves forward, so (7,5) becomes empty next turn. So RIGHT (7,5) might be safe next turn if enemy moves.\n- **LEFT (5,6)**: No apple. Puts me at (5,6). From there: UP (5,7) free, DOWN (5,5) free, LEFT (4,6) free, RIGHT (6,6) back to current head.\n\n**Closest apples:** \n- (6,0) distance 6 from (6,6)\n- (3,0) distance 7 from (6,6)\n- (0,1) distance 7 from (6,6)\n- (9,0) distance 9 from (6,6)\n- (9,2) distance 5 from (6,6) but blocked by enemy? Actually (9,2) is far.\n\nMoving DOWN (6,5) gets me closer to (6,0) (distance 5). Moving LEFT (5,6) gets me closer to (3,0) and (0,1). Moving UP (6,7) takes me away from most apples.\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**  \nEnemy is forced to move UP to (8,7). No risk of head-on collision with me this turn regardless of my move.\n\n**Future planning:**  \nMy tail is at (8,7). If I don't eat an apple, my tail will move next turn? Actually my body: head (6,6), then (7,6), tail (7,7). If I move without eating, my tail (7,7) disappears, and new tail becomes (7,6). This opens up (7,7) and (8,7) for future moves.\n\nGiven enemy's forced move UP to (8,7), they will be adjacent to my tail at (8,7)? Wait, my tail is at (8,7) currently. If enemy moves UP to (8,7), they would move into my tail \u2013 but that's my body, so they would die. However, according to rules: \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\" So if enemy moves into (8,7), they die and I survive. That's beneficial for me. But is (8,7) considered my body? Yes, it's my tail. So enemy moving UP to (8,7) would kill them.\n\nBut wait: enemy's only safe move is UP to (8,7). If they move there, they die. That means enemy will likely be dead this turn if they follow their only safe move. However, they might have a different perception? The game rules say snakes move simultaneously. So if enemy moves UP to (8,7), they die. That would leave me as the only surviving snake, and I would immediately win since \"If at any point all opponents are dead and you are alive, you immediately win.\"\n\nTherefore, I should choose a move that keeps me alive and lets enemy potentially kill themselves. All my safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) keep me alive. I should avoid RIGHT which kills me.\n\n**Which move gives best future options if enemy dies?**  \nIf enemy dies, I have the board to myself. I can then safely navigate to apples. Moving DOWN (6,5) puts me closer to apple (6,0). Moving LEFT (5,6) puts me closer to apples (3,0) and (0,1). Moving UP (6,7) takes me away from apples.\n\nSo between DOWN and LEFT, both are good. DOWN gives slightly shorter path to (6,0). LEFT gives more central position.\n\nGiven that enemy is likely to die this turn, I should move toward the closest apple to maximize score. (6,0) is distance 6 from (6,6). From (6,5), it's distance 5. From (5,6), it's distance 8 to (6,0). So DOWN is better for reaching (6,0).\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nIf enemy dies this turn (likely), I will be alone. Immediately head toward apple (6,0) via DOWN then LEFT/DOWN moves. If enemy somehow survives, be cautious of their position. My tail at (8,7) will disappear next turn if I don't eat, opening space.\n\n**Final move:** DOWN",

If enemy remains alive, be cautious of their position near top-right. Keep collecting apples, especially (6,0) and (3,0).\n\n**Final move:** DOWN",

UP and LEFT are both safe moves.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Apples available: (6,0), (9,0), (0,1), (3,0), (9,2)\n- Snake #1 is at (6,4) with body at (6,5), (6,6)\n- I'm leading 4 apples vs 2 apples\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n- UP: Moves me away from the apple cluster but keeps me safe\n- LEFT: Moves me toward the center and closer to multiple apples\n\n**Risk Evaluation:**\nLEFT to (8,7) is strategically better because it positions me to potentially go for apples at (6,0), (3,0), or (0,1) while maintaining flexibility. The apple at (9,0) is tempting but requires me to navigate down the right side, which could be risky with my long body.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:**\nAfter moving LEFT, I should consider moving DOWN next turn to start approaching the bottom-row apples. Snake #1 will likely head toward (6,0), so I might want to target (3,0) or (0,1) to avoid direct confrontation while maintaining my lead.\n\nLEFT",

My body includes (6,5) as first segment. **DEADLY** (moving into own body)\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,3): Within board. Not my body. Not enemy body. **SAFE**\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,4): Within board. Not my body. Not enemy body. **SAFE**\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,4): Within board. Not my body. Not enemy body. **SAFE**\n\nSo DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe moves.\n\n**Enemy snake #0 movement analysis:**\nEnemy head at (9,7), body: [(8,7), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5)]\nEnemy's possible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (9,8): Within board, empty, safe\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,6): Within board, but (9,6) is enemy's body segment (second segment). **DEADLY**\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,7): Within board, but (8,7) is enemy's body segment (first segment). **DEADLY**\n- RIGHT \u2192 Off board (10,7). **DEADLY**\n\nSo enemy's only safe move is UP to (9,8).\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**\nIf enemy moves UP to (9,8), no collision with any of my possible moves:\n- My DOWN to (6,3): safe\n- My LEFT to (5,4): safe  \n- My RIGHT to (7,4): safe\n\n**Apple proximity analysis:**\nFrom my head (6,4):\n- (6,0): distance 4 (straight down)\n- (3,0): distance 7\n- (0,1): distance 9\n- (9,0): distance 13\n- (9,2): distance 9\n\nClosest apple is (6,0) at distance 4. Moving DOWN gets me closer.\n\n**Future planning:**\nMy tail is at (6,6). If I don't eat an apple this turn, my tail will disappear next turn, opening (6,6). Enemy is trapped in the top-right corner with only UP move available. After moving UP to (9,8), enemy's next moves will be limited - they'll be on the top edge with body blocking DOWN and LEFT.\n\n**Long-term strategy:**\nI should pursue the closest apple at (6,0). Moving DOWN gets me closer. LEFT or RIGHT would take me away from it. Enemy is currently trapped and likely to die soon if they can't find a way out of the corner. I have a significant advantage with more space and access to apples.\n\n**Potential risks:**\n- Moving DOWN puts me at (6,3), which is safe\n- Next turn from (6,3), I could continue DOWN to (6,2), then (6,1), then (6,0) for the apple\n- Need to watch enemy's position but they're far away at (9,8) after this turn\n\n**Best move:** DOWN toward the closest apple at (6,0).\n\nDOWN",
