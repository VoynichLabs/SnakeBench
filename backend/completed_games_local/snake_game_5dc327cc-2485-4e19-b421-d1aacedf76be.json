Apples are at (1,3), (4,3), (1,9), (6,8), (8,7).\n\nI need to check each direction for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (3,7): empty. Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (3,5): empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (2,6): empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (4,6): empty. Safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe. Now, which move improves my position?\n\n**Closest apples:**  \n- (1,3) is 5 steps away (Manhattan distance: |3-1|+|6-3|=2+3=5).  \n- (4,3) is 4 steps away (|3-4|+|6-3|=1+3=4).  \n- (6,8) is 5 steps away (|3-6|+|6-8|=3+2=5).  \n- (1,9) is 7 steps away.  \n- (8,7) is 6 steps away.\n\nThe nearest apple is (4,3) at distance 4. To get closer, I should move DOWN (towards y=3) or LEFT/RIGHT to adjust x. Currently my x=3, apple x=4, so moving RIGHT gets me closer in x. But moving DOWN from (3,6) to (3,5) reduces y-distance from 3 to 2 (since |6-3|=3 \u2192 |5-3|=2). That\u2019s a good step toward the apple.\n\nAlso, I must consider the enemy snake at (1,2). It might move toward the apple at (1,3) directly above it. That apple is likely to be eaten by snake #1 soon, so maybe I should target (4,3) which is farther from the enemy.\n\nMoving DOWN keeps me central and opens future options: from (3,5) I can go DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT/UP next turn. Moving RIGHT to (4,6) takes me slightly closer to (6,8) but farther from (4,3). Actually, (4,3) is directly below (4,6), so RIGHT then DOWN later is possible, but moving DOWN now is more direct.\n\n**Potential head-on collision risk:** Enemy at (1,2) is far away (distance 5), no risk this turn.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAim for apple at (4,3). Keep an eye on enemy #1 moving toward (1,3). Avoid getting trapped in corners; maintain space.\n\n**Final choice:** DOWN gives a direct path toward nearest apple (4,3) and keeps options open.\n\nDOWN",

Its possible safe moves:\n- UP to (1,6)\n- DOWN to (1,4) (its own body \u2192 would die)\n- LEFT to (0,5)\n- RIGHT to (2,5)\n\nSo enemy likely moves UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nPotential head-on collisions this turn:\n- If I move LEFT to (3,4) and enemy moves RIGHT to (2,5) \u2192 no collision.\n- If I move UP to (4,5) and enemy moves RIGHT to (2,5) \u2192 no.\n- If I move DOWN to (4,3) and enemy moves RIGHT to (2,5) \u2192 no.\n- If I move RIGHT to (5,4) and enemy moves RIGHT to (2,5) \u2192 no.\n\nNo direct head-on collision risk exists this turn given enemy's possible moves.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\n- Apple at (4,3) is directly DOWN from me \u2192 distance 1.\n- Apple at (6,4) is RIGHT 2 cells.\n- Apple at (8,7) is far.\n- Apple at (1,9) is far.\n- Apple at (6,8) is far.\n\nMoving DOWN to (4,3) eats the apple immediately. That would grow my snake to length 2 (head at (4,3), tail at (4,4) next turn). This is the closest apple.\n\n**Safety check for DOWN:** (4,3) is within board, no self-body, enemy body at (1,4) and (1,5) not there. Enemy could move to (1,6), (0,5), or (2,5) \u2014 none conflict. So DOWN is safe.\n\n**Future flexibility after eating apple:** After eating, I'll be at (4,3) with body segment at (4,4). From there, possible moves next turn: UP (back to (4,4) \u2014 my own body, would die), LEFT to (3,3), RIGHT to (5,3), DOWN to (4,2). So three safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN). That's acceptable.\n\n**Alternative moves:** UP to (4,5) moves away from apples. LEFT to (3,4) moves slightly closer to (4,3) but not directly. RIGHT to (5,4) moves closer to (6,4). But DOWN gives immediate apple and score.\n\n**Enemy consideration:** Enemy at (1,5) could move DOWN into its own body and die, but unlikely. It might move toward apple at (1,9) via UP, or toward center. Even if enemy heads toward (4,3), I get there first this turn.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Eat apple at (4,3) now. Next turn, from (4,3) with body at (4,4), avoid UP (into body). Likely move LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN to seek next apple (maybe (6,4) or (8,7)) while avoiding potential enemy path.\n\nDOWN",

Yes (y=9 is top row).  \n- Into my own body? My body cells are (6,7), (6,6), (6,5) \u2013 not (6,9).  \n- Into enemy body? Enemy body at (2,9), (1,9) \u2013 not (6,9).  \n- Head-on collision risk? Enemy head at (3,9). Could enemy move to (6,9)? That\u2019s 3 steps right (from x=3 to x=6) in one turn \u2013 impossible. So no head-on collision.  \n- Safe? Yes.\n\n**DOWN** to (6, 7):  \n- Within board? Yes.  \n- Into my own body? Yes \u2013 (6,7) is my neck, directly behind my head. Moving backwards into my own body kills me.  \n- Eliminate.\n\n**LEFT** to (5, 8):  \n- Within board? Yes.  \n- Into my own body? No.  \n- Into enemy body? No.  \n- Head-on collision? Enemy at (3,9) can\u2019t reach (5,8) in one move (needs to go 2 right and 1 down).  \n- Safe? Yes.\n\n**RIGHT** to (7, 8):  \n- Within board? Yes.  \n- Into my own body? No.  \n- Into enemy body? No.  \n- Head-on collision? Enemy at (3,9) can\u2019t reach (7,8) in one move.  \n- Safe? Yes.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is suicide.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2 \u2013 Evaluate safe moves for apples and future options\n\n**Apples:**  \nClosest apple to my head (6,8) is (8,7) (distance |8-6|+|7-8| = 2+1 = 3), then (4,6) (distance 2+2 = 4), then (2,4), (6,1), (3,0).\n\n- **UP** to (6,9): moves away from (8,7) and most apples. Puts me on top row with fewer future moves (can\u2019t go UP next turn). Risk of being trapped later.  \n- **LEFT** to (5,8): moves slightly closer to apple (4,6) (distance from 5,8 to 4,6 = 1+2=3, from 6,8 to 4,6 = 2+2=4). Also moves toward center-left.  \n- **RIGHT** to (7,8): moves toward apple (8,7) (distance from 7,8 to 8,7 = 1+1=2). This seems best for apple proximity.\n\n**Future options:**  \nFrom (7,8): possible next moves: UP to (7,9), DOWN to (7,7), RIGHT to (8,8), LEFT back to (6,8) (but that\u2019s into my old head position, which will be empty next turn). That\u2019s 3 or 4 options likely safe.  \nFrom (5,8): similar openness.  \nFrom (6,9): only DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT next turn (3 options), but top row is riskier if enemy approaches.\n\n**Enemy movement consideration:**  \nEnemy at (3,9) likely wants apples too.

Yes (y=9 is top row).  \n- Into my own body? My body cells are (6,8), (6,7), (6,6) \u2013 not (7,9).  \n- Into enemy body? Enemy body at (3,9), (2,9) \u2013 not (7,9).  \n- Head-on collision risk?

LEFT is suicide.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Evaluate safe moves for apples and future options**\n\n**Apples:** (8,7), (3,0), (2,4), (6,1), (4,6).  \nClosest apple to my head (7,8) is (8,7) (distance |8-7|+|7-8| = 1+1 = 2), then (4,6) (distance 3+2 = 5).\n\n- **UP** to (7,9): moves away from (8,7). Puts me on top row, reducing future options (can\u2019t go UP next turn).  \n- **DOWN** to (7,7): moves toward apple (8,7) (distance from (7,7) to (8,7) = 1). Also keeps more open space.  \n- **RIGHT** to (8,8): moves toward apple (8,7) (distance from (8,8) to (8,7) = 1). But from (8,8), next turn I could go DOWN to (8,7) to eat it.\n\n**Future options & safety:**  \nFrom (7,7): next moves possible: UP back to (7,8), DOWN to (7,6), LEFT to (6,7), RIGHT to (8,7). That\u2019s 4 options.  \nFrom (8,8): next moves: DOWN to (8,7), LEFT to (7,8), UP to (8,9) \u2013 3 options.  \nFrom (7,9): next moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2013 3 options, but top row riskier.\n\n**Enemy consideration:**  \nEnemy head at (4,9). Possible moves: DOWN to (4,8), LEFT to (3,9), RIGHT to (5,9).  \nApple at (4,6) is below; enemy may move DOWN toward it. No immediate head-on threat to my safe cells.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Choose best move**\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT get me equally close to apple (8,7) in Manhattan distance.  \nDOWN to (7,7) gives more open space and keeps me centered.  \nRIGHT to (8,8) positions me to eat the apple next turn (DOWN to (8,7)), but leaves me on the right edge.\n\nGiven the board layout, DOWN seems slightly safer\u2014more room to maneuver afterward.  \nAlso, moving DOWN avoids the top row and stays away from the enemy currently at y=9.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nAfter DOWN to (7,7), next turn likely move RIGHT to (8,7) to eat the apple, then consider heading toward (4,6) or (6,1).

Moving right brings you closer to the apple at (1,9), which is directly above (0,8). Moving down keeps you on the left edge without immediate threats but moves away from the apple.\n\nGiven the immediate benefit of moving toward the apple at (1,9), and considering that moving right initially is safe and strategic to grow, I\u2019ll choose to go RIGHT. Moving right also positions you to possibly eat more apples quickly and explore further.\n\nThis approach prioritizes survival, growth, and positioning for future apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe. \u2705\n- **LEFT** to (7,6): Within board, not in my body, not in enemy body. Safe. \u2705\n- **RIGHT** to (9,6): Within board, not in my body, not in enemy body. Safe. \u2705\n\n**Head-on collision risk**: Enemy head at (7,9) likely moves RIGHT to (8,9) (only safe move; UP off-board, LEFT into own body, DOWN into my body at (7,8) would kill enemy). None of my safe moves conflict with enemy moving to (8,9). No head-on collision.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Evaluate safe moves for apples and future options**\n\nApples at: (3,0), (2,4), (6,1), (4,6), (2,3). Closest is (4,6) distance 4.\n\n- **DOWN to (8,5)**:\n  - Moves away from (4,6) (distance increases to 5) but closer to (6,1) (distance decreases to 6) and other apples.\n  - Next turn from (8,5): UP to (8,6) will be occupied by neck, but DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT likely safe (3 options).\n  - Maintains flexibility.\n\n- **LEFT to (7,6)**:\n  - Moves toward all apples, especially (4,6) (distance decreases to 3).\n  - Next turn from (7,6): Only DOWN and LEFT safe (2 options) because UP is body, RIGHT is neck.\n  - Progress toward apple cluster but reduces immediate mobility.\n\n- **RIGHT to (9,6)**:\n  - Moves away from all apples.\n  - Next turn from (9,6): Only UP and DOWN safe (2 options) because LEFT is neck, RIGHT off-board.\n  - Puts me on edge, less desirable.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Choose best move**\n\nDOWN offers the most safe follow-up moves (3 vs 2) and maintains progress toward apples like (6,1) while keeping escape routes open. LEFT is tempting for apple proximity but reduces future options, which could lead to traps. RIGHT is inferior due to edge position and moving away from apples.\n\n**Long-term plan**: After moving DOWN to (8,5), next turn consider moving LEFT or DOWN to approach apple (6,1) or eventually circle toward (4,6). Monitor enemy; it is likely moving right and poses no immediate threat. Maintain apple lead (4 vs 2) by safe, incremental consumption.\n\nDOWN",
