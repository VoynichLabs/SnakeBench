It does move us to the left edge, so afterwards I should avoid getting trapped against the wall if the enemy moves to restrict escape routes. But gaining the apple now is worthwhile and still leaves exits (e.g., (0,6) or (1,7)).\n\nShort plan for next turns:\nAfter eating at (0,7), reassess enemy movement.

RIGHT to (6,6) is optimal because it moves me into the central cluster of apples (and gives a more direct route toward the apples on the right edge at (9,6)/(9,7)). From (6,6) I will have multiple follow-up options (up, right, down) and can safely continue eastward if the path remains clear.\n- UP to (5,7) also grabs an apple but would be slightly less direct for reaching the right-side apples. DOWN is safe but moves away from the apple cluster and wastes opportunity.\n- No opponent can contest (6,6) this turn, so taking that apple is low risk and improves my position.\n\nShort plan:\n- Take (6,6) now, then push east toward (9,6)/(9,7) while avoiding head-on collisions and maintaining at least two escape options each turn.

The opponent is far in the bottom-left so no immediate head-on risk. UP is attractive for (7,8) but is slightly slower to the high-value right-edge pair (9,6)/(9,7).\n\nShort plan:\n- Take (9,6) now, then take (9,7) next if safe.

Going LEFT to (8,7) or UP to (9,8) both allow reaching (7,8) in two moves, but LEFT immediately starts a westward approach along y=7 which also aligns me to (5,7) and (3,7) subsequently.\n\nDecision and short plan:\n- I will move LEFT to (8,7). This advances toward the cluster of apples at y=7 and keeps good escape options (UP or further LEFT). Plan for the next few turns: push west along row 7 to pick up (7,8)/(5,7), then sweep down/up as needed for (6,4) and the remaining apples while avoiding the long self-body at y=6.\n\nLEFT",

It keeps several follow-up escape options (up, down, further left) and stays away from my own body mass on the right.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Continue moving left to collect the (0,7)/(0,9) apples, while avoiding entering the dense region around y=6\u20138 on the right. Reassess after each apple; keep distance from the enemy (they are far) and avoid head-on collisions by not moving into contested cells.\n\nLEFT",
