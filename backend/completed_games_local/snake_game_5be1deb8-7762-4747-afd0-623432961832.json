          "rationale": "First, I need to understand the current board state and the positions of all entities.\n\nThe board is 10x10 with coordinates from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top left? Wait, the description says: \"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\" So (0,0) is bottom left, (9,9) is top right. That means y-coordinate increases upwards, x-coordinate increases rightwards.\n\nApples are at: (5,7), (0,9), (6,1), (0,4), (6,0)\n\nMy snake (ID 0):\n- Head: (8,3)\n- Body: none (so it's just the head, no tail yet)\n- Apples: 0\n\nEnemy snake #1:\n- Head: (1,9)\n- Body: none\n- Apples: 0\n\nBoard state from the text:\n\nRow 9: A 1 . . . . . . . .   -> This means at (0,9) there's an apple (A), at (1,9) there's snake #1's head (1), and the rest are dots.\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . . \nRow 7: . . . . . A . . . .   -> So at (5,7) there's an apple (A)\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 4: A . . . . . . . . .   -> (0,4) apple\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . 0 .   -> (8,3) my head (0)\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 1: . . . . . . A . . .   -> (6,1) apple\nRow 0: . . . . . . A . . .   -> (6,0) apple\n\nSo let's list all apples: \n- (0,9) -> top left? Wait, row 9 is top? Since y=9 is top, y=0 is bottom. So row 9 is y=9, which is top. Similarly, column 0 is left, column 9 is right.\nSo apples:\n1. (5,7) -> x=5, y=7\n2. (0,9) -> x=0, y=9\n3. (6,1) -> x=6, y=1\n4. (0,4) -> x=0, y=4\n5. (6,0) -> x=6, y=0\n\nMy head: (8,3) -> x=8, y=3\nEnemy head: (1,9) -> x=1, y=9\n\nNo bodies for either snake, so both are length 1.\n\nNow, it's my turn to move. I need to choose UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nFirst, check which moves are safe.\n\nI'm at (8,3). Let's see the board around me:\nFrom the board state, at row 3: ... . . . . . . 0 .   so positions around:\n- Up: (8,4) -> row 4, column 8? Let's see row 4: \"A . . . . . . . . .\" so that would be (0,4) is A, and the rest are dots? The row is: \"A . . . . . . . . .\" which means:\n  - (0,4) A\n  - (1,4) .\n  - (2,4) .\n  - (3,4) .\n  - (4,4) .\n  - (5,4) .\n  - (6,4) .\n  - (7,4) .\n  - (8,4) . \n  - (9,4) . \n  So (8,4) is empty? Since the row has 10 characters, and the first character is at column 0? Actually, from the board, the columns are labeled 0 to 9 at the bottom, and each row has 10 symbols corresponding to columns 0 to 9.\n\nSo for row 4: \"A . . . . . . . . .\" -> so:\ncol0: A, col1: ., col2: ., ..., col9: . \nSo at (8,4): col8, row4, so symbol is \".\" which is empty.\n\nSimilarly, for down: from (8,3) down would be (8,2). Row 2: \". . . . . . . . . .\" so all dots, so (8,2) is empty.\n\nLeft: (7,3). Row 3: \". . . . . . . . 0 .\" so the last part is \".0.\" meaning col7? Let's see the row: \". . . . . . . . 0 .\" so the first character is col0, then col1, etc. So the 8th character is the 9th? Let's count: \nThe string has 10 characters: positions: \n1: . (col0)\n2: space? No, the string is: \" . . . . . . . . 0 . \" but actually from the board, it's written as: \"9 A 1 . . . . . . . .\" etc. But for the row strings, it seems they are concatenated without spaces? Let's look at the board:\n\n\" 9 A 1 . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . A . . . .\n 6 . . . . . . . . . .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 A . . . . . . . . .\n 3 . . . . . . . . 0 .\n 2 . . . . . . . . . .\n 1 . . . . . . A . . .\n 0 . . . . . . A . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\"\n\nSo for row 3: \"3 . . . . . . . . 0 .\" \nThis seems to have a space after the row number? But in the text, it's written with spaces? Actually, looking at the board, each row has the row number, then spaces, then symbols separated by spaces? But in the text, it's not consistent. Let me interpret based on the description.\n\nFrom the board, for row 3: \"3 . . . . . . . . 0 .\" \nI think the row number is \"3\", then there are symbols for columns 0 to 9. So the symbols are: after \"3\" there might be a space, then the first symbol for col0, then space, then col1, etc. But in the string, it's \" . . . . . . . . 0 .\" which has 9 symbols? No, it should be 10 symbols.\n\nPerhaps the board is displayed with the row number and then 10 symbols with spaces in between. So for row 3, it's: \"3\" then \". . . . . . . . 0 .\" meaning 10 symbols: col0: ., col1: ., col2: ., col3: ., col4: ., col5: ., col6: ., col7: ., col8: 0, col9: . \n\nYes, that makes sense. So at (8,3) my head is at col8, row3, so symbol is 0.\n\nSimilarly, for left: from (8,3) to (7,3). So what is at (7,3)? From row 3, col7 is the 8th symbol? Let's list columns for row 3:\ncol0: . \ncol1: . \ncol2: . \ncol3: . \ncol4: . \ncol5: . \ncol6: . \ncol7: . \ncol8: 0 \ncol9: . \nSo (7,3) is col7, which is . , so empty.\n\nBut wait, from the string: \" . . . . . . . . 0 .\" so there are 10 dots? No, let's count the symbols in \" . . . . . . . . 0 . \" \nIf we remove spaces, it would be \".........0.\" but that's 11 characters? I think it's better to assume that each symbol is separated by a space, so the string has 10 symbols with spaces between.\n\nFrom the board, for row 3: \"3 . . . . . . . . 0 .\" \nIf we take the part after \"3\", it has 10 characters if we consider each dot or number as a symbol, but there are spaces. Typically in such representations, after the row number, there is a space, then for each column, there is a symbol and then a space, but since the last symbol might not have a space, it's messy.\n\nTo simplify, from the coordinates, we know that (8,3) is the head, so at x=8, y=3. The board shows that at that position, it's 0. So for other positions, we can use the same logic.\n\nSo for (7,3), which is x=7, y=3. From row 3, the symbols are: from left to right, x=0 to x=9. From the board row 3: \" . . . . . . . . 0 . \" \nThe \"0\" is at the 9th position? Let's list the symbols in order: \nThe string after \"3\" is: \" . . . . . . . . 0 . \" \nIf we assume that each \".\" or \"0\" is a symbol for a column, and there are spaces between, then for 10 columns, there should be 10 symbols. So let's write them: \n- The first character after \"3\" is space, then first symbol: . (for x=0), then space, then . (x=1), then space, then . (x=2), then space, then . (x=3), then space, then . (x=4), then space, then . (x=5), then space, then . (x=6), then space, then . (x=7), then space, then 0 (x=8), then space, then . (x=9). \nSo yes, (7,3) is x=7, which is the 8th symbol? From the sequence, after the 7th dot? Let's index: \nAfter \"3\" and space, the first symbol is for x=0: . \nThen space, then symbol for x=1: . \nThen space, then symbol for x=2: . \nThen space, then symbol for x=3: . \nThen space, then symbol for x=4: . \nThen space, then symbol for x=5: . \nThen space, then symbol for x=6: . \nThen space, then symbol for x=7: . \nThen space, then symbol for x=8: 0 \nThen space, then symbol for x=9: . \nSo indeed, at (7,3), it is \".\" which is empty.\n\nSimilarly, for right: from (8,3) to (9,3). From above, at (9,3) it is \".\" so empty.\n\nNow for up: (8,4). From row 4: \"4 A . . . . . . . .\" \nSimilarly, after \"4\" and space, symbol for x=0: A, then space, then . for x=1, and so on. So for x=8, what is the symbol? \nThe sequence: x=0: A, x=1: ., x=2: ., x=3: ., x=4: ., x=5: ., x=6: ., x=7: ., x=8: ., x=9: . \nSo (8,4) is empty.\n\nFor down: (8,2). From row 2: \"2 . . . . . . . . . .\" so all dots, so (8,2) is empty.\n\nSo all four directions seem empty? But let's check if there are any snakes or obstacles.\n\nMy own body: since I have no body, I won't hit myself unless I move backwards? But since I have no body, moving in any direction won't hit my own body because there is no tail. So no self-collision risk.\n\nEnemy snake: at (1,9), which is far away, so not in my path immediately.\n\nBut I need to consider that after I move, the enemy will also move. But for immediate safety, since no other snakes are near, all moves seem safe.\n\nBut I should also consider that moving might lead to traps later, but for now, all moves are safe.\n\nNow, I need to choose a move that gets me closer to apples and keeps options open.\n\nList of apples:\n- (5,7) - this is left and up from me? I'm at (8,3), so to reach (5,7), I need to go left and up. Manhattan distance: |8-5| + |3-7| = 3 + 4 = 7 moves.\n- (0,9) - left and up, very far: |8-0| + |3-9| = 8+6=14 moves.\n- (6,1) - right and down? (6,1) is x=6, y=1, so from (8,3), |8-6| + |3-1| = 2+2=4 moves.\n- (0,4) - left and up: |8-0| + |3-4| = 8+1=9 moves.\n- (6,0) - right and down: |8-6| + |3-0| = 2+3=5 moves.\n\nSo the closest apples are (6,1) and (6,0). (6,1) is 4 moves away, (6,0) is 5 moves away.\n\nBut (6,1) is at y=1, which is lower than me (y=3), so down would be towards it, but since x=6 is less than 8, left would also be towards it.\n\nSimilarly, (6,0) is even lower, but same x=6.\n\nNow, I need to move in a direction that brings me closer to these apples.\n\nBut since I have to choose one move now, I should consider which direction gets me closer to multiple apples or keeps paths open.\n\nAlso, remember that the enemy snake might go for apples too. But from the current position, enemy is at (1,9), which is close to apples (0,9) and (0,4). So he might go for those.\n\nBut since we move simultaneously, I don't know where he will go, but I should avoid potential head-on collisions if possible, but currently, no immediate threat.\n\nLet me list the safe moves and their benefits:\n\n- UP: to (8,4). This moves away from the closer apples (6,1 and 6,0) which are down. But it might be towards (5,7)? From (8,4) to (5,7) is |8-5| + |4-7| = 3+3=6 moves, which is worse than from (8,3) to (5,7) which is 7? From (8,3) to (5,7): |8-5|=3, |3-7|=4, so 7. From (8,4) to (5,7): |8-5|=3, |4-7|=3, so 6, so yes, closer to (5,7). But (5,7) is still far, and there are closer apples.\n\nAlso, from (8,4), I can go to (7,4) or (9,4) etc., but let's see the board.\n\nAfter moving UP, I would be at (8,4), and then I have body at (8,3) since I grow only when I eat an apple? No, in Snake game, when you eat an apple, you grow, meaning you add a segment. But initially, since I have no body, if I eat an apple, I grow by one segment, so after eating, my body would include the previous head position? Let's recall the rules.\n\nThe rules say: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point.\"\n\nAnd \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one, and the last tuple is the tail.\"\n\nSo initially, for me, head is (8,3), and no body, so the snake is only one cell.\n\nIf I move to a cell with an apple, then after moving, I grow, so my new head is the new position, and my body includes the old head, so the snake becomes two cells: new head and old head.\n\nIf I don't eat an apple, I still move, but since I have no body, I just move the head, and no tail to worry about? Actually, in Snake, when you move without eating, you don't grow, so the tail moves forward, but since there is no tail initially, after moving without eating, the snake should still be length 1? Let's think.\n\nIn standard Snake, if the snake has length 1, and you move to a new cell without eating, then the head moves to the new cell, and since there was no body, the snake remains length 1. So no tail to consider.\n\nSimilarly, if you eat an apple, you grow, so after eating, the snake has length 2: head at new cell, and body at old cell.\n\nSo in this case, since I have no body, if I move to a cell with an apple, I grow, and my body will be the current head position (8,3). If I move to a cell without an apple, I remain length 1, so no body.\n\nNow, for the enemy, similarly, if he eats an apple, he grows.\n\nBut for now, let's see which moves might lead to eating an apple immediately.\n\nFrom (8,3), is there an apple in any adjacent cell?\n\nCheck the apples: \n(5,7) - not adjacent\n(0,9) - not adjacent\n(6,1) - not adjacent? (6,1) is x=6,y=1, from (8,3), the differences are dx=2, dy=2, so not adjacent.\n(0,4) - not adjacent\n(6,0) - not adjacent\n\nSo no apple adjacent to me. So I won't eat an apple on this move.\n\nTherefore, after any move, I will still have no body, since I didn't eat, so length remains 1.\n\nSo for safety, since I have no body, I cannot hit myself because there is no body behind me. So moving in any direction is safe from self-collision, as long as I don't go off the board or into another snake.\n\nNow, check if any move goes off the board:\n- UP: from (8,3) to (8,4) -> y=4, which is within 0-9, so safe.\n- DOWN: to (8,2) -> y=2, safe.\n- LEFT: to (7,3) -> x=7, safe.\n- RIGHT: to (9,3) -> x=9, safe.\n\nSo all moves are within board.\n\nNow, are there any other snakes in those cells? From the board, the only other snake is at (1,9), which is far away, so no, all adjacent cells are empty.\n\nTherefore, all four moves are safe immediately.\n\nNow, I need to choose which one to make based on getting closer to apples and keeping options open.\n\nLet me consider the apples and which direction brings me closer.\n\nThe closest apples are (6,1) and (6,0). Both have x=6, so I need to decrease x from 8 to 6, so left twice. Also, y=3, for (6,1) I need to decrease y to 1, so down twice? From (8,3) to (6,1): I need to go left twice and down twice, but since moves are one per turn, I need to sequence them.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,0), I need to go left twice and down three times? From y=3 to y=0, that's down three times, so total moves: 2 left + 3 down = 5 moves, but since I can move diagonally? No, only one direction per turn, so I need to interleave left and down moves.\n\nBut for now, I need to choose one move.\n\nIf I move left, I go to (7,3). From there, I am closer to both (6,1) and (6,0) because x=7, so only one left to x=6. And y=3, so for (6,1), I need to go down twice, for (6,0) down three times.\n\nIf I move down, I go to (8,2). From there, for (6,1), I need to go left twice and down once? From (8,2) to (6,1): dx=2, dy=1, so two moves: left left down? Or left down left? Similarly for (6,0): from (8,2) to (6,0): dx=2, dy=2, so two left and two down.\n\nIf I move right, to (9,3). This increases x, which is away from both (6,1) and (6,0), so not good.\n\nIf I move up, to (8,4). This increases y, which is away from (6,1) and (6,0), which are down, so not good for those apples. But it might be towards (5,7), but that apple is farther, and there are closer apples.\n\nSo, moving left or down seems better.\n\nNow, between left and down, which is better?\n\nIf I move left to (7,3), then from there, I can go left again to (6,3), or down to (7,2), etc.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (8,2), I can go left to (7,2) or down to (8,1), etc.\n\nNow, I need to consider the enemy snake. The enemy is at (1,9). What might he do? He might go for apples near him, like (0,9) or (0,4). But (0,9) is at (0,9), which is adjacent to him? He is at (1,9), so if he moves left, he goes to (0,9), which has an apple. So he might eat that apple on this turn if he moves left. But since we move simultaneously, if he moves left, he will eat the apple and grow. But since he is far from me, it might not affect me immediately.\n\nHowever, I should avoid potential future collisions, but for now, since he is far, probably no immediate issue.\n\nBut let's think about the long term. I have to reach 50 apples, but the game ends when any snake reaches 50, but since we are at turn 0 and no apples eaten, it's far off. But the game lasts at most 150 turns, so I need to collect apples efficiently.\n\nThe apples are scattered, so I need to plan a path to eat multiple apples.\n\nBut for now, since there are multiple apples, I should go for the closest ones first to gain points early.\n\nThe closest apples are (6,1) and (6,0). But (6,1) is at y=1, and (6,0) at y=0, so if I go to (6,1), I can then go to (6,0) if it's still there, but since apples are static until eaten, and both snakes might eat them, I need to be careful.\n\nBut currently, no one has eaten any apples, so all apples are available.\n\nNow, from my current position, (6,1) is closer in Manhattan distance? From (8,3) to (6,1): |8-6| + |3-1| = 2+2=4\nFrom (8,3) to (6,0): |8-6| + |3-0| = 2+3=5\nSo (6,1) is closer.\n\nBut (6,1) is at y=1, and (6,0) at y=0, so if I go towards (6,1), I can then go to (6,0) easily if I want.\n\nSimilarly, there is (5,7) which is up, but that requires going left and up, which might take more moves.\n\nAlso, there is (0,4) and (0,9), but those are far left.\n\nSo for now, I should head towards the cluster of apples on the right bottom? From the board, there are apples at (6,1) and (6,0), and also (5,7) is up left, but (6,1) and (6,0) are close to each other.\n\nSo let's plan to go for (6,1) first.\n\nTo reach (6,1) from (8,3), I need to decrease x and decrease y. So I need to move left and down.\n\nNow, if I move left first, I go to (7,3). From there, to (6,1), I need to go left once and down twice. So from (7,3), if I move left, I go to (6,3), then from there, I need to go down twice to (6,1)? From (6,3) to (6,1) is down twice? Yes, y from 3 to 1, so down twice. But (6,1) is at y=1, so from y=3, down twice would be to y=1, so yes.\n\nBut from (7,3), if I move down, I go to (7,2), then from there, I can go left to (6,2), then down to (6,1). So same number of moves: two moves to reach (6,1) from (7,3)? From (7,3) to (6,1): minimum moves: two moves? One left and one down? But since I can only move one direction per turn, from (7,3), if I move left, I go to (6,3), then I need to move down twice to reach (6,1). So that's three moves: left, down, down? No, from (6,3) to (6,1) requires two down moves? From (6,3) to (6,2) is one down, then to (6,1) is another down, so yes, two down moves after left, so total from (7,3): one left and two down, but since I can only do one per turn, it would take three turns: turn1: left to (6,3), turn2: down to (6,2), turn3: down to (6,1). So three turns to reach (6,1) from (7,3).\n\nSimilarly, from (7,3), if I move down to (7,2), then I can move left to (6,2), then down to (6,1), so again three turns: down, left, down.\n\nBut from current (8,3), if I move left to (7,3), then after that, I need three turns to reach (6,1), so total from start: four turns? But let's see: after first move to (7,3), then three more moves to (6,1), so total four moves to reach (6,1) from (8,3) if I go via left first? But Manhattan distance is 4, so it should take at least 4 moves, since each move changes one coordinate by 1.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down first to (8,2), then from (8,2) to (6,1): I need to go left twice and down once? From (8,2) to (6,1): dx=2, dy=1, so minimum three moves: for example, left, left, down? But after left twice, I would be at (6,2), then down to (6,1), so three moves. So from (8,3), if I move down to (8,2), then from there, three moves to (6,1), so total four moves? First move down, then three moves to (6,1), so four moves total? But since I start at (8,3), after first move to (8,2), I am at (8,2), and then I need to reach (6,1), which is two left and one down, so three moves, so total turns: first move to (8,2), then second move to (7,2) or (8,1), etc., then third move to (6,2) or (7,1), then fourth move to (6,1). So yes, four moves to reach (6,1) from (8,3) regardless of which direction I go first, as long as I move towards it.\n\nBut if I move directly towards it, I can reach it in four moves.\n\nNow, similarly for (6,0), from (8,3) to (6,0): dx=2, dy=3, so Manhattan distance 5, so five moves.\n\nSo for now, I should move towards (6,1).\n\nNow, between moving left or down first, which is better?\n\nI need to consider the board and potential obstacles or traps.\n\nAlso, since the enemy might go for apples, but he is far from these apples, so probably no conflict.\n\nBut let's see the board around me.\n\nAfter moving left to (7,3), what are the available moves? From (7,3), I can go up, down, left, right? \n- Up: (7,4) - from row 4, at x=7, y=4, which is empty? From row 4: \"4 A . . . . . . . .\" so for x=7, it should be dot, since x=0 is A, then dots for x=1 to x=9? So yes, empty.\n- Down: (7,2) - from row 2, all dots, so empty.\n- Left: (6,3) - from row 3, at x=6, y=3, from row 3: \" . . . . . . . . 0 .\" so for x=6, it is dot? From earlier, row 3: x=0 to x=7 are dots, x=8 is 0, x=9 is dot, so x=6 is dot, so empty.\n- Right: (8,3) - but that would be back to where I came from? But since I have no body, moving back is not hitting myself because there is no body? But the rule says: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" But since I have no body, there is no cell behind me? So moving backwards should be safe? Let's see the rule: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" And \"moving directly backwards into your own body\" is a specific case. But since I have no body, if I move back to (8,3) from (7,3), I would be moving into a cell that was my previous head position, but since I have no body, that cell is empty now? After I move from (8,3) to (7,3), the snake is now at (7,3) with no body, so the cell (8,3) is empty. So if I move back to (8,3), I am moving into an empty cell, so no self-collision. So it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (8,2), from there, I can go up, down, left, right?\n- Up: (8,3) - empty after I leave? Similarly, safe.\n- Down: (8,1) - from row 1, at x=8, y=1, row 1: \" . . . . . . A . . .\" so for x=8, it is dot? Since x=6 is A, so x=8 is dot, so empty.\n- Left: (7,2) - empty.\n- Right: (9,2) - from row 2, all dots, so empty.\n\nSo from both (7,3) and (8,2), I have multiple options.\n\nNow, is there any reason to prefer one over the other?\n\nI should also consider that after moving, I might be closer to other apples or have better escape routes.\n\nAnother thing: the enemy snake might move towards me? But from (1,9), it's unlikely to come towards (8,3) quickly, since it has apples near it.\n\nBut let's think about potential future collisions. Since both snakes are length 1, if we ever meet head-on, we both die. So I should avoid moving towards where the enemy might go, but since he is far, it might not be an issue for now.\n\nPerhaps I should move towards the apple that is less likely to be taken by the enemy. The enemy is near (0,9) and (0,4), so he might go for those. The apples on the right, like (6,1) and (6,0), might be safer for me to take.\n\nSo I'll proceed towards (6,1).\n\nNow, between left and down, both seem reasonable. But let's see the board for potential obstacles.\n\nIf I move down to (8,2), then from there, I can move left to (7,2), then to (6,2), then to (6,1). This path seems clear.\n\nIf I move left to (7,3), then to (6,3), then to (6,2), then to (6,1). Also clear.\n\nBut notice that at (6,1) there is an apple, so when I reach (6,1), I will eat it and grow, so my body will be behind me.\n\nSimilarly, for (6,0), but I'll go for (6,1) first.\n\nNow, is there any advantage to moving down first? For example, if I move down to (8,2), then I am closer to (6,0) in terms of y-coordinate? From (8,2) to (6,0) requires two left and two down? From (8,2) to (6,0): dx=2, dy=2, so Manhattan distance 4, so four moves? But from (8,2) to (6,0): if I go left twice to (6,2), then down twice to (6,0), so four moves. From (8,3) to (6,0) is five moves, so from (8,2) it's four moves, so moving down first reduces the distance to (6,0) by one? From (8,3) to (6,0) is 5 moves, from (8,2) to (6,0) is 4 moves, so yes.\n\nBut since I'm going for (6,1) first, which is closer, then after eating (6,1), I might go for (6,0).\n\nBut after eating (6,1), my snake will have length 2, so I need to be careful not to hit my own body.\n\nBut for now, since I haven't eaten, no body.\n\nAnother apple: (5,7) is at y=7, which is up, and I am at y=3, so if I go up, I might reach it, but it's farther.\n\nBut let's see if there is an apple directly above or below. From the board, at y=4, there is an apple at (0,4), but that's far left. So no.\n\nSo I think going left or down is fine.\n\nBut let's check if from (7,3) or (8,2), I can see any issues with the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (1,9). If he moves down, he might go to (1,8), etc., but still far.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that after I move, the enemy might move towards me? But since there are apples in between, he might go for apples first.\n\nTo be safe, I should avoid moving directly towards the enemy, but since he is at top left and I am at bottom right, moving left or down doesn't directly towards him? Moving left decreases x, which towards the left where he is, but he is at x=1, so from x=8 to x=1, so yes, moving left is towards him, but since he is far, it might not be an issue for many turns.\n\nSimilarly, moving down is away from him? He is at y=9, I am at y=3, so moving down decreases y, so away from him? Since he is at high y, and I am at mid y, moving down to lower y, so away from him? Yes, so moving down might be better to avoid him? But since he is far, it might not matter.\n\nBut let's think about the long-term. If I move left, I might eventually go to the left side where there are apples, but there are also apples on the right, so I might not need to go left immediately.\n\nThe apples at (0,9) and (0,4) are on the left, but I have apples at (6,1) and (6,0) on the right, so I can eat those first without going left.\n\nSo to avoid the enemy, I might stay on the right side. But the enemy is on the left, so if I stay on the right, I might avoid him.\n\nBut if I move left, I might go towards him, but since there are apples in between, it might be okay.\n\nBut for now, since I have apples on the right, I should focus on those.\n\nSo moving down might be better because it keeps me on the right side? From (8,3), if I move down to (8,2), I am still at x=8, so on the right side. If I move left to (7,3), I am at x=7, which is still right, but closer to center? x=7 is towards left from x=8.\n\nBut both are on the right half.\n\nNow, let's see the board for any obstacles in the path.\n\nIf I go towards (6,1), the path seems clear, as per the board state.\n\nSimilarly for (6,0).\n\nBut I need to choose one move now.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that after moving, I want to have multiple safe moves for the next turn.\n\nFrom (8,2), I have up, down, left, right all safe, as above.\n\nFrom (7,3), similarly, all directions safe.\n\nSo both have good options.\n\nBut let's see the apple at (6,0). It is at y=0, which is the bottom row. If I go to (6,1) first, then from there, I can go down to (6,0) easily, but since (6,1) has an apple, when I eat it, I grow, so after eating, my body will be at the previous head position, so if I go from (6,1) to (6,0), I might hit my own body if I don't careful? Let's see.\n\nSuppose I am at (6,1) with head, and I have eaten the apple, so my body is at the previous head position. If I moved to (6,1) from (6,2), then after eating, my body is at (6,2). Then if I move down to (6,0), I am moving to a new cell, and my body will still be at (6,2), so no self-collision because the head is at (6,0) and body at (6,2), so no issue as long as I don't move into my own body later. But when I move from (6,1) to (6,0), the head moves to (6,0), and the body moves? In Snake, when you move, the head moves to new cell, and the tail moves forward if you didn't eat, but if you ate, the tail doesn't move, so you grow. So after eating at (6,1), when I move to (6,0), the head goes to (6,0), and since I ate last turn, the tail doesn't move, so the body is still at (6,2) and head at (6,0), so the snake has length 3? Let's think.\n\nAfter eating an apple, the snake grows by one segment. So from length 1, after eating, length 2: head at new position, body at old position.\n\nThen when I move again, if I don't eat, the head moves to new position, and the tail moves forward, so the snake remains length 2? No, in standard Snake, when you eat, you grow, so the number of segments increases. So from length 1, after eating, length 2. Then when you move without eating, the head moves, the tail moves, so the snake remains length 2? No, when you move without eating, the snake moves forward, so the head moves to new cell, and the tail moves forward one cell, so the length remains the same? But in this case, after eating, length is 2, so when I move without eating, head moves to new cell, tail moves from the old tail to the cell ahead, so if length is 2, there is only one body segment between head and tail. So after eating, head at H, body at B, tail at B? No, for length 2, the snake has two segments: head and body, and the body is also the tail? In snake, the tail is the last segment. So for length 2, coordinates: [head, body] where body is also the tail. When you move without eating, head moves to new cell, and the tail moves to the cell where the body was? Let's clarify.\n\nFrom the rules: \"the snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one, and the last tuple is the tail.\"\n\nSo for a snake of length 2, the list is [head, tail]. When the snake moves without eating, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail is removed? But then the snake would become length 1? That's not right.\n\nIn standard Snake, when the snake moves without eating, the entire snake moves forward: the head moves to the new cell, and each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, and the tail is removed? But in terms of coordinates, the new list would be [new_head, old_head, old_body, ...] until the tail? But since the tail is removed, the list should have the same length? I think I have a confusion.\n\nLet me read the rules carefully: \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one, and the last tuple is the tail.\"\n\nAnd \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point.\"\n\nSo, when you move, the head always moves to the new cell. If you didn't eat an apple, then the tail is removed, so the snake moves forward without growing. If you ate an apple, the tail is not removed, so the snake grows by one segment, meaning the new list has one more segment than before.\n\nSo for example, if a snake has length 1: list = [head]. If it moves to a new cell without eating, then the new list should be [new_head]? But that would mean the snake moved, but since there was no tail, it just moves? But in that case, the length remains 1. If it eats an apple, then after moving, the list becomes [new_head, old_head]? So length 2.\n\nIf a snake has length 2: list = [head, body]. When it moves without eating, the new head is at new position, and the body becomes the old head, and the tail? Since length 2, the body is also the tail? But then if we remove the tail, we would have only head? That doesn't make sense.\n\nIn standard Snake, for a snake of length L, when it moves without eating, the new head is at new position, and the new body includes the old head and all body segments except the last one? No, actually, the entire snake shifts forward: the new head is at new position, the second segment moves to the old head position, the third segment moves to the old second segment position, and so on, and the last segment (tail) is removed. So the length remains the same.\n\nBut in terms of coordinate list, if the old list is [H, B1, B2, ..., T] where T is tail, after moving without eating, the new list is [new_H, H, B1, ..., B_{L-2}] so the tail T is removed, so length remains L.\n\nBut if it eats an apple, then the tail is not removed, so the new list is [new_H, H, B1, ..., T] so length becomes L+1.\n\nSo for a snake of length 1, list = [H]. After moving without eating, new list = [new_H]? But that would mean length 1, which is correct. After moving with eating, new list = [new_H, H] so length 2.\n\nFor length 2, list = [H, T]. After moving without eating, new list = [new_H, H] so length 2? But where is the tail? In [new_H, H], the tail is H? But H is the old head, which becomes the new body, and the new tail is the old head? But in terms of segments, the snake now has two segments: new head and new body (which is old head), so the tail is the new body? So yes, length 2.\n\nAfter moving with eating, new list = [new_H, H, T] so length 3.\n\nSo in this case, for me, currently length 1: list = [(8,3)].\n\nIf I move to a cell with apple, after move, list = [new_head, (8,3)] so length 2.\n\nIf I move to a cell without apple, list = [new_head] so length 1.\n\nSo in my case, since no apple adjacent, after any move, I will still have length 1, so no body to worry about for self-collision.\n\nTherefore, for the next turn, I will still be length 1, so no risk of self-collision.\n\nSo for now, all moves are safe, and I can choose any direction.\n\nBut to decide, let's see which move gets me closer to multiple apples or sets up a good path.\n\nAnother apple: (5,7) is at (5,7), which is left and up. From (8,3), to reach (5,7), I need to go left 3 times and up 4 times, so 7 moves. But if I go left first, I might be on the way, but it's far.\n\nSimilarly, (0,4) is left and up, but very left.\n\nSo for efficiency, I should go for the closest apples first: (6,1) and (6,0).\n\nSo I need to move towards them.\n\nNow, from (8,3), to reach (6,1), I need to decrease x and decrease y. So moving left or down both help.\n\nBut if I move down, I decrease y, which is towards both (6,1) and (6,0)? (6,1) has y=1, so from y=3 to y=1, down twice? Similarly for (6,0), down three times.\n\nIf I move left, I decrease x, towards x=6.\n\nSo both are good.\n\nBut let's see the board for any reason to prefer one over the other.\n\nNotice that at y=1, there is an apple at (6,1), and at y=0, there is an apple at (6,0). So if I go down to y=2, I am closer to y=1 and y=0.\n\nIf I go left to x=7, I am closer to x=6.\n\nBut also, there is an apple at (6,1), which is at y=1, so if I go down, I might reach y=1 sooner, but from y=3, I need to go down twice to reach y=1, so if I move down first, I go to y=2, then I need another down to reach y=1, so two down moves to reach y=1 from y=3.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left first, I go to x=7, then need another left to reach x=6, so two left moves to reach x=6 from x=8.\n\nSo from (8,3), to reach (6,1), I need at least two left and two down moves, so four moves, as before.\n\nBut the order of moves might affect if I can eat other apples or avoid obstacles.\n\nBut from the board, there are no obstacles in the path to (6,1).\n\nAnother thing: the enemy might go for (6,1) or (6,0)? But he is at (1,9), so to reach (6,1), he needs to go down and right, which is many moves, so probably not soon.\n\nSo I think it's safe.\n\nNow, perhaps I should move down because it keeps me on the right side? Or move left because it might be towards other apples? But let's see the apple at (0,4) and (0,9), but they are far, and the enemy is there, so might be contested.\n\nSo I'll go for the apples on the right.\n\nNow, to choose between left and down, let's see which one allows me to see more options or avoid dead-ends.\n\nFrom (8,3), if I move left to (7,3), then from there, I can go down to (7,2), which is closer to (6,2) and (6,1), or I can go left to (6,3), then down to (6,2) etc.\n\nSimilarly, if I move down to (8,2), then from there, I can go left to (7,2), etc.\n\nBut notice that at y=0, there is an apple at (6,0), and at y=0, the board has apples at (6,0) and also at (0,0)? From the board, row 0: \"0 . . . . . . A . . .\" so at (6,0) there is apple, and no other apples on row 0.\n\nSimilarly, at y=1, apple at (6,1) and no other? From row 1: \"1 . . . . . . A . . .\" so at (6,1) apple.\n\nSo for me, from (8,3), moving down might be better because it brings me closer to both apples on the bottom, and since y=0 is the bottom, moving down might lead me to the bottom row where there are two apples close together? (6,0) and (6,1) are adjacent vertically, so once I reach one, I can easily reach the other.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left, I might be going towards the left where there are apples but also the enemy.\n\nBut let's calculate the distance to the apple cluster.\n\nFrom (8,3), the nearest point in the cluster (6,0) and (6,1) is (6,1) at distance 4, or (6,0) at distance 5.\n\nIf I move down to (8,2), then distance to (6,1) is |8-6| + |2-1| = 2+1=3, so reduced by 1.\nDistance to (6,0) is |8-6| + |2-0| = 2+2=4, reduced by 1.\n\nIf I move left to (7,3), then distance to (6,1) is |7-6| + |3-1| = 1+2=3, reduced by 1.\nDistance to (6,0) is |7-6| + |3-0| = 1+3=4, reduced by 1.\n\nSo both moves reduce the distance equally.\n\nSo no difference in terms of distance reduction.\n\nNow, another factor: the enemy. The enemy is at (1,9). If he moves, he might go left to (0,9) to eat the apple there, or down to (1,8), etc.\n\nIf I move left, I am moving towards the left side, so potentially towards the enemy's area, but since he might be busy eating apples on the left, he might not come my way soon.\n\nIf I move down, I am moving away from him.\n\nSo to avoid potential future conflict, moving down might be better.\n\nBut since the board is large, and we have many turns, it might not matter soon.\n\nPerhaps I should move down because there are two apples on the bottom right, so moving down gets me closer to them.\n\nSimilarly, if I move left, I am moving towards the center, but there are no apples directly on the left from me? From the board, at y=3, there are no apples between x=7 and x=0? From row 3, all dots, so no apples.\n\nSo moving left doesn't immediately bring me to an apple, while moving down doesn't either, but moving down gets me closer to the bottom apples.\n\nBut from both moves, I need two moves to reach an apple? From (7,3) to (6,1) requires three moves? From (7,3) to (6,1): as before, three moves? From (7,3) to (6,1): the path is left to (6,3), then down to (6,2), then down to (6,1)? But from (6,3) to (6,1) is two down moves, so yes, three moves from (7,3). From (7,3) to (6,1) directly is not possible in one move, so minimum three moves.\n\nSimilarly from (8,2) to (6,1): from (8,2) to (6,1): left to (7,2), then left to (6,2), then down to (6,1)? That's three moves? Or from (8,2) to (7,2) to (7,1) to (6,1)? But from (7,1) to (6,1) is left, so also three moves. So from (8,2), it takes three moves to reach (6,1)? But from (8,2) to (6,1) Manhattan distance is 2+1=3, so yes, three moves.\n\nSo from either (7,3) or (8,2), it takes three moves to reach (6,1).\n\nBut from (7,3), if I move down to (7,2), then from (7,2) to (6,1) requires one left and one down, so two moves, so from (7,3) to (6,1) via down first: move down to (7,2), then left to (6,2)? No, from (7,2) to (6,1) I can move left to (6,2) then down to (6,1), so two moves after down? From (7,3) to (7,2) is one move, then from (7,2) to (6,1) requires two moves? Let's see: from (7,2) to (6,1) is dx=1, dy=1, so minimum two moves: either left then down, or down then left? But since I can only move one direction per turn, from (7,2) if I move left, I go to (6,2), then from (6,2) I move down to (6,1), so two moves. So from (7,3) to (6,1) via down: down to (7,2), then left to (6,2), then down to (6,1)? That's three moves: down, left, down. So same as before.\n\nFrom (7,3) if I move left to (6,3), then from (6,3) to (6,1) requires two down moves, so again three moves: left, down, down.\n\nSo always three moves from (7,3) to (6,1).\n\nSimilarly from (8,2) to (6,1): from (8,2) if I move left to (7,2), then from (7,2) to (6,1) requires two moves as above, so left, then left and down? From (7,2) to (6,1) can be done in two moves: left then down, or down then left? So from (8,2), move left to (7,2) (1 move), then from (7,2) to (6,1) requires two moves? No, from (7,2) to (6,1) requires one left and one down, so two moves: for example, left to (6,2), then down to (6,1). So total from (8,2) to (6,1): first move left to (7,2), then second move left to (6,2), then third move down to (6,1)? But that's three moves? But Manhattan distance from (8,2) to (6,1) is 2+1=3, so it should take three moves? Yes, because each move changes one coordinate by 1, so from x=8 to x=6, need two left moves, from y=2 to y=1, need one down move, so three moves in total.\n\nSo from (8,3) to (6,1) takes four moves: from (8,3) to (7,3) or (8,2) takes one move, then from there to (6,1) takes three moves, so total four moves.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nTherefore, from a distance perspective, both moves are equivalent.\n\nSo I need another reason to choose.\n\nLet's consider the long-term plan. After eating (6,1), I will have length 2, and then I can go to (6,0) or other apples.\n\nFrom (6,1), I can go down to (6,0) to eat another apple, so that might be efficient.\n\nSo I should ensure that from (6,1), I can easily go to (6,0).\n\nBut from (6,1), to go to (6,0), I need to move down, which is safe as long as (6,0) is empty or has apple? (6,0) has apple, so if I move there, I eat it and grow, so it's good.\n\nBut after eating at (6,1), my body will be at the previous head position. If I came from (6,2) to (6,1), then after eating, my body is at (6,2). Then when I move to (6,0), I move down from (6,1) to (6,0), so the head moves to (6,0), and since I ate last turn, the tail doesn't move, so my body remains at (6,2), so the snake has segments at (6,0), (6,2)? But there is a gap at (6,1)? No, after eating at (6,1), the snake has head at (6,1) and body at (6,2). Then when I move to (6,0), the head moves to (6,0), and the body moves? In Snake, when you move, the head moves to new cell, and the body follows: the first body segment moves to the old head position, the second body segment moves to the old first body segment position, etc., and if no eating, the tail is removed. But if I ate last turn, then when I move, the tail is not removed, so the body segments shift, but the tail stays? Let's use coordinates.\n\nSuppose snake has coordinates [H, B] where H is head, B is body. After moving without eating, new head H' , and new body becomes [H]? So the new list is [H', H]? So the old body B is removed? But that would mean the snake moves without growing, so length remains 2, but the old body B is gone, and new body is H? So the snake moves forward: from [H, B] to [H', H]. So the tail becomes the old head? So the segment B is lost? But in standard Snake, when you move without eating, the snake slides forward, so the tail moves to the cell where the body was, but since the body moves to where the head was, the tail moves to where the body was? I think I have it.\n\nFrom the rules, the snake moves simultaneously: the head moves to a new cell, and then the body follows: each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front of it. So for a snake of length 2, after moving without eating, the new head is at new position, the new body is at the old head position, and the old body is discarded? So the snake remains length 2, but the tail moves from the old body position to the old head position? So the new list is [new_head, old_head]. So the old body is gone? But then the snake has only two segments: new head and old head, so the old body is not included? But in the initial state, for length 2, we have [head, body] where body is also the tail? So when moving, the body becomes the new tail? So yes, for length 2, after moving without eating, the snake has new head and old head as body, so the old body is gone? But in terms of segments, the snake has two segments: the new head and the segment that was previously the head, which is now the body and tail.\n\nSo in practice, when the snake moves, the tail always moves? No, only when not eating? Let's clarify with an example.\n\nSuppose snake has coordinates: [(1,1), (1,0)] so head at (1,1), body/tail at (1,0). If it moves right to (2,1) without eating, then the new coordinates should be [(2,1), (1,1)] so the body is now at (1,1), and the tail is at (1,1)? But that's only two points, so the tail is at (1,1), which is the body? So the snake is now at (2,1) and (1,1), so the segment at (1,0) is gone? But that means the snake moved without growing, so the tail moved from (1,0) to (1,1)? So yes, the tail moves forward to the cell where the body was? In this case, the body was at (1,0), but after moving, the body is at (1,1), so the tail moved from (1,0) to (1,1)? So the segment at (1,0) is removed, and the new tail is at (1,1). So for length 2, after moving, the snake has the new head and the old head as body, so the old body is lost? But in this case, the old body was the tail, so yes, the tail moved forward.\n\nSo in general, when a snake moves without eating, the tail moves forward, so the snake maintains the same length. When it eats, the tail does not move, so the length increases.\n\nSo for my case, since I have length 1, after moving without eating, I still have length 1, so no body to worry about.\n\nAfter eating, I have length 2, so I need to be careful not to hit my own body.\n\nBut for now, since I haven't eaten, I don't have a body, so for this move, all directions are safe, and for the next move, after I move, I still have length 1, so no body, so I can move in any direction, including backwards, without self-collision.\n\nSo from a self-collision perspective, no issue.\n\nTherefore, for this move, I can choose any direction, but I should choose one that leads me towards apples.\n\nSince both left and down are towards apples, I need to pick one.\n\nPerhaps I should move down because it gets me closer to the bottom where there are two apples, and it might be less crowded? But let's see the board: at the bottom, there are apples at (6,0) and (6,1), but also at (0,4) and (0,9), so the bottom left has no apples? From the board, at y=0, only (6,0) has apple, so the bottom right has apple, bottom left has no apple? From row 0: only (6,0) has apple, so yes.\n\nSimilarly, at y=1, only (6,1) has apple.\n\nSo the apples on the bottom are only at x=6, y=0 and y=1.\n\nSo if I go down, I might be heading towards that cluster.\n\nIf I go left, I might be heading towards the left where there are apples but also the enemy.\n\nSo perhaps down is better.\n\nBut let's see the enemy's potential moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (1,9). He has an apple at (0,9) which is adjacent left. So he might move left to eat it. If he does, he will grow to length 2. Then he might go for other apples.\n\nBut since he is on the left, he might stay on the left.\n\nSo if I stay on the right, I might avoid him for a long time.\n\nSo moving down might keep me on the right side.\n\nMoving left might bring me towards the center, but since there are no apples on the center from me, it might not be useful.\n\nSo I think moving down is slightly better.\n\nBut let's check the board for any dead-ends.\n\nFrom (8,3), if I move down to (8,2), then from there, I have options: up, down, left, right. All seem open.\n\nIf I move left to (7,3), similarly open.\n\nSo no issue.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that there is an apple at (0,4) which is at y=4, x=0, and from me, if I go left, I might eventually reach it, but it's far, and the enemy might take it.\n\nBut since I have closer apples, I should focus on those.\n\nSo I'll decide to move down.\n\nBut let's see if there is an apple directly in the down direction? From (8,3) down to (8,2), no apple. Then to (8,1), no apple? From row 1, at x=8, it's dot, so no apple. To (8,0), from row 0, at x=8, it's dot, so no apple. So no apple directly down.\n\nSimilarly, left to (7,3), no apple, then to (6,3), no apple, etc.\n\nSo both paths have no direct apples, but lead to apples after several moves.\n\nSo for this move, it doesn't matter much, but I need to choose one.\n\nPerhaps I should move towards the apple that is less likely to be taken by the enemy. The enemy is near (0,9) and (0,4), so he might take those first. The apples at (6,1) and (6,0) are far from him, so I can take them without competition.\n\nSo I'll go for (6,1) and (6,0).\n\nNow, to decide between down and left, let's see which one allows me to reach (6,1) in a way that I can also reach (6,0) easily.\n\nIf I go down to (8,2), then from there, I can go left to (7,2), then to (6,2), then to (6,1). From (6,1), I can go down to (6,0). So that seems fine.\n\nIf I go left to (7,3), then from there, I can go down to (7,2), then to (6,2), then to (6,1), then to (6,0). Similarly fine.\n\nSo no difference.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the turn number. It's turn 0, and we have 150 turns, so plenty of time, so I can choose any.\n\nBut I need to output a move.\n\nAnother thought: the enemy might move towards me? But from (1,9) to (8,3) is far, so unlikely.\n\nPerhaps I should move down because it's towards the bottom, and there are two apples there, so after eating them, I might have points early.\n\nBut let's see the score: currently, both have 0 apples, so if I eat two apples quickly, I have 2 points, which might give me a lead.\n\nSo I should move towards the cluster of two apples.\n\nFrom (8,3), to reach the cluster, I need to go to (6,1) or (6,0).\n\nSo I'll move down.\n\nBut let's confirm the board: from (8,3), moving down to (8,2) is safe, as per board state.\n\nSo I'll choose DOWN.\n\nBut wait, the coordinate system: y increases up, so moving down decreases y, so from (8,3) to (8,2) is down.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think I'll go with DOWN.\n\nBut let's see if there is any reason to go left. For example, if I go left, I might be closer to another apple? But from the list, the next apple is (5,7) which is left and up, so from (7,3), I can go up and left, but that might be towards (5,7), but (5,7) is farther than (6,1), so I should go for the closer one first.\n\nSimilarly, (0,4) is far.\n\nSo no.\n\nTherefore, I'll move down.\n\nSo my move is DOWN.I am at (8,3) with no body, so all four moves are immediately safe since there are no obstacles or other snakes nearby. The closest apples are (6,1) and (6,0), which are to the left and down from my current position. Moving down towards the bottom right brings me closer to this apple cluster, which includes two apples close together. This path keeps me on the right side, away from the enemy snake near the left, and allows me to efficiently collect apples early in the game. After moving down, I will still have length 1, so no self-collision risk, and I will have multiple safe options for future moves.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "First, I need to understand the current board state and my position. I am Snake #0 with my head at (6, 1) and my body at (7, 1). The apples are at (5, 7), (0, 4), (6, 0), (4, 0), and (5, 8). Snake #1 is at (0, 6) with its body at (0, 7).\n\nI'm considering my possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. I must eliminate any move that would kill me immediately.\n\n1. **DOWN**: Moving down would take me to (6, 0). According to the board state, there's an apple at (6, 0). Moving onto an apple is safe and beneficial, but I need to check if it's safe. The board shows (6, 0) as an apple, so there's no snake body there. However, I must also consider if any other snake might move into that same cell. Snake #1 is at (0, 6), which is far away, so it's unlikely they would move to (6, 0) in one turn. Also, moving down doesn't immediately kill me based on my own body; my body is at (7, 1), so moving to (6, 0) is not into my own body. So DOWN seems safe and gets me an apple.\n\n2. **LEFT**: Moving left would take me to (5, 1). I need to check if (5, 1) is safe. From the board, it appears empty. But I should verify if there's any snake body. My body is at (7, 1), so (5, 1) is not directly connected to my body, so no issue. Enemy snake is far. So LEFT might be safe, but it doesn't get me an apple immediately.\n\n3. **RIGHT**: Moving right would take me to (7, 1), but that's where my body is! Since my body is at (7, 1), moving right into that cell would be hitting my own body, which would kill me. So RIGHT is not safe.\n\n4. **UP**: Moving up would take me to (6, 2). From the board, it looks empty. No immediate threats. But it doesn't get me an apple.\n\nNow, considering the rules: if I move onto an apple, I grow and gain a point. Also, I need to think about future moves. But for now, I should prioritize safe moves that get me apples.\n\nI also need to consider the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (0, 6), which is far away, so they are not an immediate threat. However, since all snakes move simultaneously, I should think about where they might move. But from the last rationale, it seems the enemy is not close, so I can focus on getting apples.\n\nFrom my last move, I moved LEFT to (7, 1), and now I'm considering moving LEFT again to (6, 1), but that doesn't get me an apple. I see an apple at (6, 0), so moving DOWN to (6, 0) would get me that apple immediately.\n\nLet me list the safe moves: DOWN and LEFT are safe, UP is safe, but RIGHT is unsafe.\n\n- DOWN: to (6, 0) - has apple, so I grow. Safe because no snake there.\n- LEFT: to (5, 1) - no apple, but safe.\n- UP: to (6, 2) - no apple, but safe.\n\nAmong these, DOWN gives me an apple, so it should be preferred. But I need to ensure it's not risky due to simultaneous movement.\n\nCould Snake #1 move to (6, 0)? Unlikely, as it's far away. Snake #1 is at (0, 6), and to reach (6, 0), it would need to move diagonally or multiple steps, but each move is only one cell in cardinal direction. From (0, 6), moving right would go to (1,6), down to (0,5), etc., so in one turn, it can't reach (6,0). So no risk of head-on collision.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple, my body will grow. Currently, my body is [(7,1)], so after moving to (6,0) and eating, my new body will be [(6,0), (6,1), (7,1)]? Let's think: when I move, my head moves to the new cell, and my body follows. If I eat an apple, I grow, so my tail doesn't move for that turn. So from head (6,1), body (7,1), if I move DOWN to (6,0) and eat, then new head is (6,0), body becomes [(6,0), (6,1)]? No, the body should include the previous head and all body segments.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: when moving, the head moves to the new cell, each body segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front, and if no apple is eaten, the tail is removed. If an apple is eaten, the tail is not removed, so the body grows by one segment.\n\nIn this case, current body: head (6,1), body [(7,1)]. So if I move DOWN to (6,0) and eat apple, then:\n- New head: (6,0)\n- The body segment that was at (7,1) moves to where the head was, so (6,1)\n- But since I ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body becomes [(6,0), (6,1)]? No, the body list is ordered head-to-tail. After move, the head is at (6,0), and the body should be the previous head position and the previous body, so [(6,1), (7,1)]? Let's clarify.\n\nFrom the initial state: Head at (6,1), body at [(7,1)]. So the snake is two segments: head at (6,1), body at (7,1), meaning the tail is at (7,1).\n\nWhen I move, if I don't eat an apple, the head moves to new position, the body shifts: the first body segment moves to the old head position, and the tail moves to where the first body segment was, so if only one body segment, after move without eating, head moves to new, body becomes [old head], and tail moves to where body was, so effectively, the snake moves forward.\n\nBut in terms of the coordinate list: after move without eating, the new list is [new_head, old_head] for a snake of length 2? Let's see the current body list: it's [(7,1)], which is the body segment after the head. So for a length-2 snake, the list should be [head, body] or [head, tail]? The problem says: \"the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one, and the last tuple is the tail.\" So for my snake, head is (6,1), and body is [(7,1)], meaning the tail is (7,1). So the full snake is (6,1) connected to (7,1).\n\nWhen I move, if I move to a new cell without eating, the new head is at the new cell, and the body becomes the old head, and the tail is removed? But since there's only one body segment, after moving, the new body should be [old head], so the snake becomes [new_head, old_head]. But the old body segment (7,1) is no longer there because the tail moved? Let's think: when moving, the tail moves to where the body was, but since the body was only one segment, after moving, the new tail is where the body was? No.\n\nStandard snake movement: each segment moves to the position of the segment in front. So if head moves to new cell, the first body segment moves to the old head position, and the tail moves to where the first body segment was, so if the snake has length L, after moving without eating, the new snake has the same length, with new head, and all segments shifted, so the tail leaves its old cell.\n\nIn this case, length 2: head at (6,1), tail at (7,1). After moving without eating: head moves to new position, say (5,1), then the body moves to where the head was, so (6,1), and the tail moves to where the body was? But the body was at (7,1), so after movement, the snake would be: head at (5,1), body at (6,1), and tail at (7,1)? But that would mean the snake has three segments? No, because when moving, the tail disappears if no apple is eaten.\n\nI think I'm confusing myself. Let me read the rules again: \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one, and the last tuple is the tail.\"\n\nSo for my snake, currently: head (6,1), body [(7,1)] \u2013 so the list is [(6,1), (7,1)]? No, the body is given as a list, but it says \"body: [(7,1)]\", so the full snake list would be [ (6,1), (7,1) ]? But the body is listed separately. In the description, it says \"Head: (6,1), Body: [(7,1)]\", so the body is the list of segments after the head. So the full snake is: head, then body[0], which is the tail since only one body segment.\n\nSo the snake has two cells: head and tail.\n\nWhen moving, if no apple eaten, the head moves to a new cell, and the tail moves to where the head was? No, that would be incorrect.\n\nStandard snake movement: the snake moves by moving the head forward, and each body segment moves into the position of the segment in front, so the tail is left behind, thus shortening the snake? But that doesn't make sense because the snake length should remain the same if no apple is eaten.\n\nI think I have it: when a snake moves, the head moves to a new cell. Then, the body follows: each segment moves to the position of the segment in front. So for a snake with segments [S0, S1, S2, ..., S_{L-1}] where S0 is head, S_{L-1} is tail, after moving without eating, the new segments are: new head at new position, then S0, S1, ..., S_{L-2}. So the tail S_{L-1} is removed. Thus, the snake length remains the same.\n\nIn this case, my snake has two segments: head at (6,1), tail at (7,1). So after moving to a new head position, say (5,1), without eating, the new snake would have head at (5,1) and body at [(6,1)], so tail at (6,1). Thus, the cell (7,1) is vacated.\n\nIf I eat an apple, then after moving, the new snake has head at new position, and the body includes the old head and all old body segments, so length increases by 1. So from length 2, after eating, length becomes 3. So new head at new position, old head becomes first body segment, old tail becomes second body segment? No, in the list, after eating, the new body list includes all old segments plus the old head? Let's see the rules: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point.\" So the snake gains one segment, meaning the length increases by one. How does that affect the coordinate list? The new head is at the apple, and the body is the old snake, so the list becomes [new_head, old_head, old_body_1, ..., old_tail]. So for me, currently [head, tail] = [(6,1), (7,1)]. If I move to (6,0) and eat apple, then new head is (6,0), and the body is [ (6,1), (7,1) ]? But the body should be the old snake, so the full list would be [(6,0), (6,1), (7,1)]. So I have three segments.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo back to moves: if I move DOWN to (6,0), which has an apple, I eat it, and my new snake becomes head at (6,0), body at [(6,1), (7,1)]. So I grow to length 3.\n\nNow, is (6,0) safe? From the board, it's an apple, so no snake there. Also, no other snake can reach it in one move, as established.\n\nNow, what about other moves? If I move LEFT to (5,1), which is empty, I don't eat an apple, so my snake moves: head to (5,1), body becomes [(6,1)], tail at (6,1), so length remains 2. But I don't gain any apple.\n\nSimilarly, if I move UP to (6,2), empty, no apple.\n\nSo clearly, moving DOWN gives me an apple and growth, while others don't.\n\nBut I should consider if there are any risks. For example, after moving DOWN, my head is at (6,0), body at (6,1) and (7,1). Now, if the enemy snake moves in a way that it collides with me? But enemy is far, so unlikely.\n\nAlso, I need to think about future moves. After eating, I have more options to go for other apples. The apples are at (5,7), (0,4), (4,0), (5,8). Note that (4,0) is also an apple, which is close to (6,0). From (6,0), I can move LEFT to (5,0), but is (5,0) empty? From board, (5,0) is not listed as apple, and from the board state, row 0: columns 0-9: . . . . A . A . . . so at (5,0) it's empty? Let's see: from the board string: \"0 . . . . A . A . . .\" so positions: 0:., 1:., 2:., 3:., 4:A, 5:., 6:A, 7:., 8:., 9:. so yes, (5,0) is empty. So from (6,0), I can move LEFT to (5,0) or DOWN? But (6,0) is at y=0, so moving down would be outside board, since y=0 is the bottom. So from (6,0), I can only move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT? Let's see coordinates: from (6,0), y=0, so moving down would be to (6,-1), which is outside, so invalid. Similarly, left to (5,0), right to (7,0), up to (6,1). But (6,1) is where my body would be after moving down? Let's see.\n\nAfter moving DOWN to (6,0) and eating, my body becomes: head (6,0), body segments: (6,1) and (7,1). So if I then move UP to (6,1), that would be into my own body, which would kill me. So from (6,0), I cannot move UP immediately because that's where my body is. But that's for the next turn, not this turn.\n\nFor this turn, moving DOWN is safe and beneficial.\n\nNow, is there any reason not to move DOWN? For example, if I move DOWN, I might trap myself later? But from (6,0), I have left to (5,0), right to (7,0), and up to (6,1) but that's into my body, so only left and right are possible. (7,0) is empty? From board, row 0: ... A . A . . so at (7,0) it's . , empty. So I can move to (7,0) or (5,0) next. Also, from (5,0), I can go to (4,0) which has an apple, so that's good. So moving DOWN now sets me up to eat (4,0) next.\n\nIf I move LEFT now to (5,1), then from there I can move DOWN to (5,0) or DOWN to (4,0)? From (5,1), moving DOWN to (5,0) which is empty, and then to (4,0) for apple. But if I move LEFT now, I don't get an apple immediately, so I delay growth.\n\nSimilarly, if I move UP, I go away from the apples.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN, DOWN is better because I get an apple now.\n\nAlso, from the last rationale, I was considering LEFT to (6,1) but I already did that last turn? Last move I moved LEFT to (7,1)? Let's see my last move: \"My last move information: LEFT\" and \"placing my head at (7,1)\"? No, from the state: \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (6,1), Body: [(7,1)]\" so after last move, head is at (6,1)? Let's read carefully.\n\nIn the last move information: \"Moving LEFT last turn was successful, placing my head at (7,1).\" But from the current state, head is at (6,1). There might be a inconsistency.\n\nLook: \"Turn: 4 / 150\" and \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (6,1), Body: [(7,1)]\"\n\nBut in last move rationale: \"Moving LEFT last turn was successful, placing my head at (7,1).\" That doesn't match. Perhaps the body is listed, and after move, head moved to (7,1), but then from the state, it seems head is at (6,1). I think there's a mistake in my interpretation.\n\nLet's read the initial state: \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (6,1), Body: [(7,1)]\" so after turn 4, head is at (6,1). But last move rationale says \"placing my head at (7,1)\"? That must be from turn 3? Let's see the turn: Turn 4 / 150, so we are at turn 4, and we need to make move for turn 4? No, the turn number might indicate the current turn.\n\nThe problem says: \"Turn: 4 / 150\" and then \"Your last move information:\" so probably, after turn 3, we have this state, and we need to make move for turn 4.\n\nIn the last move, we moved LEFT, and from the rationale, it placed head at (7,1). But in the current state, head is at (6,1)? That doesn't match.\n\nPerhaps the body is listed, and after move, the head moved, and the body updated. Let's assume that the current state is after our last move.\n\nFrom the board: row 1: \"1 . . . . . . 0 T . .\" so at y=1, x=6, there is 0, which is our head? But in the coordinate, x=6, y=1, so (6,1) has 0, and at x=7, y=1, there is T? But T is for tail? In the board, \"0\" is our head, \"T\" is our tail? But from the state, our body is at (7,1), so yes, (6,1) is head, (7,1) is body.\n\nBut in the last move rationale, it says \"placing my head at (7,1)\"? That must be a mistake in the rationale? Or perhaps after last move, head was at (7,1), but then for this turn, the state has head at (6,1)? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's read the last move rationale: \"Moving LEFT last turn was successful, placing my head at (7,1).\" So after moving LEFT, head is at (7,1). But in the current state, head is at (6,1). So perhaps the current state is after some other move? No, the turn is 4, and we have last move information, so after last move (turn 3), we have this state? But the state shows head at (6,1), so if we moved LEFT last turn from some position, we should be at (7,1)? I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps the \"last move\" is for turn 3, and the state shown is after turn 3? But then why is head at (6,1)? Let's see the coordinates: from the board, at (6,1) there is 0, so head is at (6,1). But if we moved LEFT last turn, from where? If we were at (7,1) and moved LEFT, we would go to (6,1), so that matches! Yes, so last turn, we were at (7,1) and moved LEFT to (6,1). So the rationale saying \"placing my head at (7,1)\" is incorrect; it should be at (6,1). But in the rationale, it says \"placing my head at (7,1)\" which is the old position? Let's read: \"Moving LEFT last turn was successful, placing my head at (7,1).\" That must be a typo in the rationale. Because from the state, after move, head is at (6,1). So probably, the rationale meant that after moving LEFT, we are now at (6,1), but it said (7,1) by mistake? Or perhaps I misread.\n\nLet's read carefully: \"Moving LEFT last turn was successful, placing my head at (7,1).\" But from the current head position, it's (6,1), so this doesn't add up. Perhaps the \"body\" is listed, and the head is at (6,1), so after moving LEFT, from (7,1) to (6,1), yes, head is now at (6,1). So the rationale should say \"placing my head at (6,1)\" but it says (7,1)? Let's see the text: \"placing my head at (7,1)\" \u2013 that must be a error in the rationale provided? But in the context, it says \"I am still safe\" and \"moving LEFT to (6,1)\" so probably it's a typo, and it should be (6,1).\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll trust the current state: head at (6,1), body at (7,1).\n\nSo for this turn, turn 4, I need to make a move.\n\nFrom head (6,1), possible moves:\n- UP: to (6,2) - safe?\n- DOWN: to (6,0) - has apple, safe?\n- LEFT: to (5,1) - safe?\n- RIGHT: to (7,1) - but body is at (7,1), so hitting own body, unsafe.\n\nSo RIGHT is unsafe.\n\nNow, for DOWN: to (6,0). Is there any snake body there? From the board, at (6,0) there is A, which is apple, so no snake. Also, enemy snake is far, so no issue. So DOWN is safe and gets an apple.\n\nFor LEFT: to (5,1), empty, safe.\n\nFor UP: to (6,2), empty, safe.\n\nSo among safe moves, DOWN gives me an apple, so I should choose DOWN.\n\nBut let's confirm if moving DOWN might cause a head-on collision with enemy? Enemy is at (0,6), so unlikely. Also, since all snakes move simultaneously, I need to consider where enemy might move. But from the state, enemy snake #1 has head at (0,6) and body at (0,7). So enemy might move, but since they are far, no collision risk.\n\nAlso, from the rules, if I move onto an apple, I grow, which is good.\n\nSo I think DOWN is the best move.\n\nNow, for the response, I need to output only one word: the direction.\n\nSo I'll output DOWN.\n\nBut in the last rationale, I thought about moving LEFT to (6,1), but that was for previous turn. Now, after moving to (6,1), I have better options.\n\nSo my decision is DOWNDOWN",
