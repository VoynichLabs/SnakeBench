Body: None.\n- **Apples:** (8, 8), (5, 7), (3, 1), (4, 0), (2, 5).\n- **Turn:** 0/150.\n\n**Coordinate System:**\n- (0,0) is bottom-left.\n- (9,9) is top-right.\n- Moving **UP** increases Y.\n- Moving **DOWN** decreases Y.\n- Moving **RIGHT** increases X.\n- Moving **LEFT** decreases X.\n\n**Current Position (0, 8):**\n- I am against the left wall.\n- **Left (X-1):** X would be -1. Invalid (Wall).\n- **Down (Y-1):** (0, 7). Valid.\n- **Up (Y+1):** (0, 9). Valid (Top wall is Y=9).\n- **Right (X+1):** (1, 8). Valid.\n\n**Immediate Obstacles:**\n- No snake bodies are currently adjacent.\n- Enemy snake #0 is at (3, 4). It is far away and cannot reach me or an apple I am targeting in one turn (max distance 4). We are not on a collision course.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- **Apples:**\n  - (8, 8): Far right, top. Distance: 8 right, 0 up/down.\n  - (5, 7): Right, slightly down. Distance: 5 right, 1 down.\n  - (3, 1): Right, way down. Distance: 3 right, 7 down.\n  - (2, 5): Right, down. Distance: 2 right, 3 down.\n  - (4, 0): Right, bottom left. Distance: 4 right, 8 down.\n- **Goal:** I need to move towards the apples. Staying at (0, 8) is isolated. The cluster of apples is to the right.\n- **Safety:**\n  - If I go **UP** to (0, 9), I am pinned at the corner. If the enemy moves to block (1, 9) or (0, 8) (if I survive), I can be trapped. It limits my escape routes.\n  - If I go **DOWN** to (0, 7), I am moving away from the horizontal cluster of apples, though I am opening up space to move right later. However, I am moving away from the nearest apple (8,8) horizontally.\n  - If I go **RIGHT** to (1, 8), I move towards the apples. I open up options to go Up, Down, or Right next turn. This seems most flexible.\n  - If I go **LEFT**, I die.\n\n**Comparison of Safe Moves:**\n1.  **RIGHT (1, 8):** Moves towards the apples. Opens up the board. Maintains distance from enemy.\n2.  **UP (0, 9):** Puts me in a corner. Risky if the enemy decides to pressure the top edge later. Limits movement to [Right or Down] next turn.\n3.  **DOWN (0, 7):** Moves away from the immediate horizontal targets (like (8,8)) and closer to (4,0) but down a long way. Still moves towards (5,7) eventually.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **RIGHT** is the most balanced move. It progresses towards all apples (specifically the ones with x > 0) and keeps my movement options open. I will not move into the enemy's path, as they are far away. I will not collide with anyone.\n\n**Plan:** Move Right to (1, 8) to begin traversing the board towards the apple cluster at (8, 8) and (5, 7). Assess enemy movement next turn to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving LEFT would take me to (2, 8), which is the position I just came from, so it would be moving into my own previous body position (running into myself), which is fatal. This leaves DOWN to (3, 7) or RIGHT to (4, 8).\n\nThe board shows apples at (8, 8), (5, 7), (4, 0), (2, 5), (6, 7). The closest apples relative to my current position are at (5, 7) and (6, 7), which are slightly down and to the right. The apple at (8, 8) is straight right.\n\nLet's evaluate the remaining moves:\n- **DOWN to (3, 7)**: This lands on a cell that is part of the board (empty). It brings me closer to the row of apples at (6, 7) and (5, 7). It also opens up options to move left or right next turn.\n- **RIGHT to (4, 8)**: This is also a valid empty cell. It moves me towards the apple at (8, 8).\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake (#0) at (3, 1) with body (3, 2). It is far away and not an immediate threat.\n\nI should prioritize moves that don't lead to dead ends. Moving UP to the wall is bad. Moving LEFT runs into myself. So only DOWN and RIGHT are safe.\n\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT:\n- RIGHT moves towards (8, 8) but keeps me on row 8.\n- DOWN moves to row 7, which has a cluster of apples at (5, 7) and (6, 7).\n\nLet's check if the path is open. If I go DOWN to (3, 7), I am in the column 3, row 7. If I go RIGHT to (4, 8), I am in row 8.\n\nLooking at the board state:\nRow 8: ` . . . 1 . . . . A .`\nRow 7: ` . . . . . A A . . .`\n\nIf I go DOWN to (3, 7), I am at (3, 7). The apples at (5, 7) and (6, 7) are directly to the right. If I go RIGHT to (4, 8), I am at (4, 8) and the apple at (5, 7) is down-left.\n\nThe apple at (5, 7) is very close. If I am at (3, 8) and move DOWN to (3, 7), I am adjacent to (4, 7) and (3, 6) and (2, 7). The apple at (5, 7) is 2 steps away. The apple at (6, 7) is 3 steps away.\n\nIf I stay at row 8 moving RIGHT, I might be chasing the (8, 8) apple, but there are closer apples. The prompt says to prefer moves that increase chance of safely eating apples. Eating apples grows the snake, which is good.\n\nThe apple at (5, 7) is reachable. If I go DOWN now, next turn I can go RIGHT to (4, 7), then RIGHT to (5, 7). That seems like a good plan. If I go RIGHT now to (4, 8), the path to (5, 7) is RIGHT then DOWN. It's also valid.\n\nHowever, the apple at (8, 8) is on the top row. Being on row 8 near the top wall limits vertical movement. Row 7 is more open. Also, the snake #0 is at y=1. The action is at y=7 and y=8.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 9 is all empty (except boundaries).\nRow 8 is empty at 0,1,2,4,5,6,7.\nRow 7 is empty at 0,1,2,3,4,8,9.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (3, 7), I am in a very open area. I can reach (5, 7) easily. I can also reach (6, 7) easily.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 8), I am also open, but I am one step closer to the wall at x=9.\n\nThe apple at (8, 8) is at the far right. The apples at (5, 7) and (6, 7) are closer in terms of Manhattan distance to my potential future positions if I go down. If I go down to (3, 7), my distance to (5, 7) is 2. If I go right to (4, 8), my distance to (5, 7) is 2 (Right then Down) or 2 (Down then Right) depending on path.\n\nWait, let's look at the enemy snake. Snake #0 is at (3, 1) with body at (3, 2). It's moving up usually to get to apples. The closest apples for snake #0 are at (2, 5) and (4, 0). It's far away.\n\nI am at (3, 8).\nMove DOWN to (3, 7).\nMove RIGHT to (4, 8).\n\nLet's consider the \"future options\".\nIf I move DOWN to (3, 7), I can move RIGHT to (4, 7). Or UP to (3, 8) (back to where I was). Or LEFT to (2, 7) (empty). Or DOWN to (3, 6).\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 8), I can move DOWN to (4, 7). Or UP to (4, 9) (Wall!). Or LEFT to (3, 8) (where I am now). Or RIGHT to (5, 8).\n\nMoving to (4, 8) creates a situation where UP is a wall immediately (since y=9 is the top). That's a restriction.\nMoving to (3, 7) keeps me away from the top wall. The top row (y=9) is a trap zone.\n\nAlso, looking at the apples:\n(5, 7) is at x=5, y=7.\n(6, 7) is at x=6, y=7.\n(8, 8) is at x=8, y=8.\n\nIf I am at (3, 7), I am on the same Y row as the (5, 7) and (6, 7) apples. This is advantageous for horizontal movement.\nIf I am at (4, 8), I am above them.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN seems better to align with the cluster of apples at y=7.\n\nLet's double check the board state for obstacles at (3, 7).\nBoard row 7: `. . . . . A A . . .`\nColumn 3: `.` (row 9), `.` (row 8), `.` (row 7), `.` (row 6)...\nSo (3, 7) is empty. Safe.\n\nLet's double check the board state for obstacles at (4, 8).\nBoard row 8: `. . . 1 . . . . A .`\nColumn 4: `.` (row 9), `.` (row 8 - wait, row 8 at x=4 is empty? Board says: ` . . . 1 . . . . A .` (dots are empty, 1 is me at 3, A is apple at 8). So yes, (4, 8) is empty. Safe.\n\nHowever, if I go DOWN to (3, 7), next turn I can go RIGHT to (4, 7) -> (5, 7) (Apple).\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 8), next turn I can go DOWN to (4, 7) -> RIGHT to (5, 7).\nThe path is similar in length.\n\nBut, consider the enemy. If the enemy (at y=1) moves UP, it comes to y=2, etc. It's slow. I am safe.\n\nThe main reason to go DOWN is to avoid the top wall (y=9). If I go RIGHT to (4, 8), I am at y=8. If I continue RIGHT, I hit x=9 wall. If I go UP, I hit y=9 wall. So staying at y=8 near the right side is restrictive.\nIf I go DOWN to y=7, I have a huge open board below me (rows 0-6) and above me (rows 8-9). This maximizes future options.\n\nAlso, the apple at (2, 5) is left and down. If I go DOWN now, I can eventually head left to (2, 5) or stay right for (5, 7) / (6, 7).\n\nConclusion: DOWN is the best move for \"future options open\".\n\n**Strategy:** Move DOWN to (3, 7) to get onto the same row as the apples at (5, 7) and (6, 7), while avoiding the restrictive top wall.\n\nDOWN",

This is the path to the closest apple cluster. It is a safe move that opens up options to the right.\n    *   **DOWN (3, 5):** Moves onto an apple immediately. This guarantees growth and keeps the body count low (staying at length 1). However, looking at the board, the column to the left (x=0-2) seems somewhat enclosed, and moving down might limit mobility towards the apples in the upper right quadrant. Since I am currently length 1, I don't need to worry about running into my own tail immediately, but eating this apple will create a tail at (3, 6) on the next turn. If I go DOWN now and eat, I can't go back UP immediately without hitting my new tail. Still, it's a point.\n    *   **LEFT (2, 6):** Moves towards the apple at (2, 5). It's a safe move, but moving Left usually brings me towards the edge of the board and away from the denser apple cluster at (5, 7), (6, 7), and (8, 8).\n    *   **RIGHT (4, 6):** Moves towards the apples at (5, 7) and (6, 7). This is a good direction towards the center/right side of the board.\n\n*   **Decision:**\n    *   The apple at (3, 5) is tempting because it's an immediate eat, but it blocks the vertical path. The apples at (5, 7) and (6, 7) are worth points and moving toward them keeps me in the game longer with more options.\n    *   Since Snake #0 is far away, I don't need to run away. I should eat apples.\n    *   Moving **UP** to (3, 7) positions me perfectly to go for (5, 7) or (6, 7) next. It seems like the safest path to future points without trapping myself.\n\nI will move UP towards the apple cluster.\n\n**Plan:** Move UP towards the apple cluster at (5,7) and (6,7). From (3,7), I can then move RIGHT towards (5,7).\n\nUP",

From there, I can move towards (4, 9) or (8, 8). However, looking at the column x=3, moving UP puts me closer to the top edge. Specifically, (3, 8) is near the apple at (8, 8), but it's a long distance horizontally. I should check if this keeps my future options open. (3, 8) is safe.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 6):** This is my previous position (I just moved UP from here). My tail will be at (3, 6) if I eat an apple or move elsewhere, but generally, moving back is risky. If I don't eat this turn, my tail stays at (3, 6), so moving DOWN is illegal (suicide). Even if I eat, my tail moves to (3, 6) eventually, but immediately moving back into it is bad. Usually, one avoids moving back. Let's assume I shouldn't go back to where I just was unless necessary.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 7):** The board shows `(2, 7)` is empty (column 2, row 7). It is next to the apple at (2, 5) (down 2 steps). It is also somewhat near the apple at (5, 7).\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 7):** The board shows `(4, 7)` is an `A` (Apple). Eating this apple is advantageous.\n\n**Comparing the best options:**\n-   **RIGHT to (4, 7):** Moves directly onto an apple. This grows my snake immediately. The new body segment will appear at (3, 7). This is a safe, growth-oriented move.\n-   **UP to (3, 8):** Moves towards the top right apples. However, it doesn't eat an apple immediately.\n-   **LEFT to (2, 7):** Moves towards the apple at (2, 5), but (4, 7) is closer (actually, it's adjacent).\n\nBetween moving to a safe empty cell and moving to a safe cell with an apple, the apple is preferred. Also, moving RIGHT keeps me in the center of the board, maintaining flexibility.\n\n**Enemy Snake #0:**\nHead at (4, 1). It is far away (y=1 vs y=7). It poses no immediate threat. It might move up, but it's on the other side of the board.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 7) is the best move. It grabs an apple immediately, keeps the snake short (for now, actually it grows, but low density), and maintains good board position.\n\nPlan: Eat the apple at (4, 7). From there, I will be at (4, 7) with a body segment at (3, 7). The next turn, I can continue going for the apple cluster at (5, 7) and (6, 7) or explore upwards.\n\nRIGHT",

This is a safe move. However, it moves away from the dense cluster of apples at (5, 7), (6, 7), and (4, 9). It also moves towards Snake #0, which is at y=2. Distance to Snake #0 head is 4 steps. It's safe for now, but not offensive.\n3.  **LEFT (3, 7):** This is my body. It is strictly forbidden. I would die immediately.\n4.  **RIGHT (5, 7):** The board state showed `A` at (5, 7). This is an apple! Eating this grows me again. My body will become [(4, 7), (3, 7)]. This is excellent. It also clears the path to the next apple at (6, 7).\n\nComparison:\n-   **RIGHT (5, 7)** provides immediate growth and keeps me in the row with apples at (5, 7) and (6, 7). It also keeps options open to go UP to (5, 8) or (5, 9) later.\n-   **UP (4, 8)** moves towards the apple at (4, 9), but (5, 7) is equally accessible and I am currently at x=4. Wait, I am at (4, 7). The apple at (5, 7) is adjacent. The apple at (6, 7) is also in that direction.\n-   **DOWN (4, 6)** is safe but falls behind in score potential.\n\nStrategy: The cluster of apples at (5, 7), (6, 7), and (8, 8) is very attractive. The apple at (4, 9) is also high value. Moving RIGHT to (5, 7) secures the second apple in a chain.\n\nIs (5, 7) safe from enemy movement?\nSnake #0 is at (4, 2).\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n-   UP: (4, 3) - Safe.\n-   DOWN: (4, 1) -> (4, 0) is tail. It would hit its tail if it moves DOWN (unless it eats, but no apple there).\n-   LEFT: (3, 2) - Safe.\n-   RIGHT: (5, 2) - Safe.\nNone of these moves bring Snake #0 to (5, 7). The distance is huge. Head-on collision is impossible this turn.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the optimal move to secure the apple at (5, 7).\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #0 is at (4, 3) with body [(4, 2), (4, 1)].\nApples are at (8, 8), (2, 5), (6, 7), (4, 9), (9, 1).\nMy previous move was RIGHT to (5, 7), eating an apple.\nMy potential body is [(5, 7), (4, 7)] if I had eaten at (5, 7). Wait, I ate at (5, 7) in the previous turn? The prompt says \"Turn: 8 / 150\" and \"My last move information... RIGHT... eating an apple\".\nLet's verify the coordinates and game state logic.\nStarting state (Turn 8 input):\n- My snake (ID 1): Head: (5, 7), Body: [(4, 7)].\n- Apples: (8, 8), (2, 5), (6, 7), (4, 9), (9, 1).\n- Board state (Turn 8 input):\n  7 . . . . T 1 A . . .  (This implies (4,7) is T, (5,7) is 1). Wait, the board shows \"T 1 A\" at y=7. x=4 is T, x=5 is 1, x=6 is A.\n  Let's re-read the Turn 8 input carefully.\n  \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (5, 7), Body: [(4, 7)]\"\n  \"Apples at: (8, 8), (2, 5), (6, 7), (4, 9), (9, 1)\"\n  \"Board state: ... 7 . . . . T 1 A . . .\"\n  This means (6,7) is an Apple ('A'). (5,7) is my head ('1'). (4,7) is my tail ('T').\n  \n  My last move was RIGHT.\n  My previous position (Turn 7) was (4, 7).\n  I moved to (5, 7).\n  Did I eat an apple?\n  The apples listed for Turn 8 include (6, 7) and (5, 7) is NOT listed. Wait, let's check the \"My last move information\".\n  \"My last move information: ... RIGHT ... eating an apple.\"\n  If I moved from (4,7) to (5,7) and ate an apple, then (5,7) was an apple.\n  But the \"Apples at\" list for Turn 8 does NOT include (5, 7). It includes (6, 7).\n  This is a discrepancy in the prompt if it says I ate an apple at (5,7).\n  Let's look at the board again. \"T 1 A\" at x=4,5,6.\n  Maybe the \"Apples at\" list is the CURRENT list of apples *before* I make my move for Turn 8?\n  Or is it the list of apples *remaining*?\n  \n  Let's trace the Turn 8 prompt exactly.\n  \"Turn: 8 / 150\"\n  \"Apples at: (8, 8), (2, 5), (6, 7), (4, 9), (9, 1)\"\n  This list does NOT contain (5,7).\n  \n  However, the \"My last move information\" says: \"RIGHT ... eating an apple.\"\n  And the Rationale says: \"I am currently at (4, 7). ... RIGHT (5, 7): The board state showed `A` at (5, 7).\"\n  \n  There is a contradiction between the \"Board state\" (which shows `T 1 A` at y=7) and the \"Apples at\" list (which does not include (5,7)).\n  Usually, the explicit list \"Apples at\" is the ground truth for the state of the board.\n  \n  Let's look at the \"Board state\" grid again:\n  `7 . . . . T 1 A . . .`\n  This line corresponds to y=7.\n  x=4: T (My tail from Turn 7)\n  x=5: 1 (My head at Turn 8 start)\n  x=6: A (Apple)\n  \n  If I am at (5,7) at the start of Turn 8, and the apple is at (6,7), then I did NOT eat an apple in the previous move (Turn 7).\n  The text \"eating an apple\" in the last move info might be a hallucination or a test of attention.\n  The previous move was from (4,7) to (5,7). The apple was NOT at (5,7). It was at (6,7).\n  So I did not grow.\n  My body is still [(4,7)].\n  \n  Let's verify the \"Your snake (ID: 1)\" section.\n  \"Head: (5, 7), Body: [(4, 7)], Apples collected: 1\"\n  \n  So, at the start of Turn 8:\n  - Head: (5, 7)\n  - Body: [(4, 7)]\n  - Apples: (8, 8), (2, 5), (6, 7), (4, 9), (9, 1)\n  \n  Now I need to make a move for Turn 8.\n  Possible moves from (5, 7):\n  - UP: (5, 8)\n  - DOWN: (5, 6)\n  - LEFT: (4, 7) -> My body. Forbidden.\n  - RIGHT: (6, 7) -> Apple!\n  \n  Analysis:\n  1.  **RIGHT (6, 7):** There is an apple here. I should eat it.\n      Safety check:\n      - Board edge: x=6 is within [0,9]. Safe.\n      - My body: (6,7) is not (5,7) or (4,7). Safe.\n      - Enemy snake #0: Head (4,3), Body [(4,2), (4,1)].\n        Distance is large.\n      - Enemy movement: We don't know their move, but (6,7) is far from (4,3).\n      - If I eat (6,7), I grow. My new body will be [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7)].\n      \n  2.  **UP (5, 8):**\n      - Board edge: Safe.\n      - My body: Safe.\n      - This moves towards (5, 9) or (4, 9).\n      \n  3.  **DOWN (5, 6):**\n      - Board edge: Safe.\n      - My body: Safe.\n      - This is empty.\n      \n  Strategy:\n  Eating the apple at (6, 7) is the best move. It increases my score and length, and clears the path to (8, 8) or (7, 7).\n  \n  Is there any immediate danger?\n  Snake #0 is at (4, 3).\n  If Snake #0 moves UP, it goes to (4, 4).\n  If Snake #0 moves RIGHT, it goes to (5, 3).\n  It is very far away.\n  \n  Wait, I should check for head-on collisions.\n  Could Snake #0 reach (6, 7)? No.\n  Could Snake #0 reach (5, 8) or (5, 6)? No.\n  \n  So, moving RIGHT to (6, 7) is safe and optimal.\n  \n  Let's double-check the contradiction again.\n  Prompt: \"My last move information: ... eating an apple.\"\n  Prompt Board: `7 . . . . T 1 A`\n  Prompt Apples List: `... (6, 7) ...`\n  \n  If the board `T 1 A` is accurate for y=7, then (5,7) is my head and (6,7) is an apple.\n  If I moved RIGHT from (4,7) to (5,7), I did not eat anything.\n  So the text \"eating an apple\" is incorrect for the previous move.\n  This means my length has NOT increased. I am still length 2.\n  \n  Moving to (6, 7) will eat the apple there.\n  \n  Let's look at the \"My last move information\" again.\n  \"Current position: (4, 7). My previous move was RIGHT to get here, eating an apple.\"\n  This is part of the \"history\" provided by the system. It says I am at (4,7) and just moved RIGHT.\n  But the main game state says \"Head: (5, 7)\".\n  If I am currently at (4,7) (as per the \"last move\" block), then I haven't moved yet this turn? No, that block is describing the previous turn.\n  \n  Let's trust the \"Current Game State\" section over the \"Last Move Rationale\" history text, as the history text often contains the agent's internal monologue or a summary that might be slightly idealized (e.g. claiming to have eaten).\n  \n  Current Game State:\n  - Me: (5,7), Body [(4,7)].\n  - Apples: (6,7) is present.\n  \n  Decision:\n  Move RIGHT to (6, 7).\n  This eats an apple.\n  \n  Long-term plan:\n  Eat the apples in the top-right quadrant (6,7 -> 8,8 -> 9,9).\n  Monitor snake #0 at (4,3).\n  \n  Let's verify safety of (6,7).\n  Is there any snake at (6,7)? No.\n  Is it out of bounds? No.\n  Is it my body? No.\n  \n  What if Snake #0 decides to move UP and then eventually chase me?\n  It's on the left side of the board (x=4). I am moving to the right side (x=6).\n  There is a large gap.\n  \n  What if I move UP to (5,8)?\n  (5,8) is empty.\n  (5,9) is empty (based on board: `9 . . . . A . . . . .`).\n  (4,9) is an apple.\n  Moving UP keeps me in the x=5 column.\n  Moving RIGHT puts me on the apple at (6,7).\n  \n  Eating the apple is generally priority 1.\n  \n  Check for traps.\n  If I go to (6,7), I grow.\n  My body will be [(6,7), (5,7), (4,7)].\n  Next turn, I can move to (7,7), (6,8), (6,6), or (5,7) (backwards, fatal).\n  (6,8) is empty.\n  (7,7) is empty.\n  (6,6) is empty.\n  So I will have options.\n  \n  If I go to (5,8):\n  My body will be [(5,8), (5,7), (4,7)].\n  Next turn, I can go to (5,9) (empty), (6,8) (empty), (4,8) (empty), or (5,7) (fatal).\n  Also good options.\n  \n  However, (6,7) is an apple. (5,8) is not.\n  Therefore, (6,7) is strictly better.\n  \n  One more check: Snake #0.\n  Head at (4,3).\n  Possible moves for S0:\n  - UP: (4,4)\n  - DOWN: (4,2) -> This is its body part. It would die.\n  - LEFT: (3,3)\n  - RIGHT: (5,3)\n  \n  S0 is unlikely to go DOWN because it hits itself.\n  S0 is safe going UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n  S0 cannot reach me.\n  \n  Final decision: RIGHT.\n  \n  Long-term strategy note:\n  \"Eat the apple at (6,7) to grow. Plan to head towards (8,8) next. Keep an eye on Snake #0 at (4,3), currently no threat. Avoid getting trapped near the top wall if I go for (4,9) later.\"\n  \n  I will include the plan in the output as requested.\n  \n  Wait, I need to output the plan and then the move.\n  The prompt says: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n  \n  And: \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\n  \n  So structure:\n  [Rationale]\n  [Long-term plan]\n  [Move]\n  \n  Wait, the prompt says \"This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\" This implies I should put the plan in a specific format? Or just text?\n  Looking at the examples (implied), I should just write it clearly.\n  \n  Let's double check the \"My last move information\" again.\n  \"Current position: (4, 7). My previous move was RIGHT to get here, eating an apple.\"\n  If I am at (4,7), then I am not at (5,7).\n  But the \"Your snake (ID: 1)\" section says \"Head: (5, 7)\".\n  This is extremely confusing.\n  \n  Let's look at the board again:\n  `7 . . . . T 1 A . . .`\n  T at x=4. 1 at x=5. A at x=6.\n  \n  If I am at (4,7), the board would look like `7 . . . . 1 T A ...`\n  If I am at (5,7), the board is `7 . . . . T 1 A ...`\n  \n  The board shows T at 4, 1 at 5.\n  So I am at (5,7).\n  \n  The text \"Current position: (4, 7)\" in the last move block is describing the state *before* the last move, or it's a hallucination/contradiction I must resolve.\n  Given the visual board and the explicit \"Head: (5, 7)\" field, I will trust that I am at (5, 7).\n  \n  If I am at (5, 7), and I have an apple at (6, 7), I move RIGHT.\n  \n  What if the \"Current position: (4, 7)\" is correct and the board \"1\" is at 5 but that's where I'm going?\n  No, \"Board state\" is the state *now*.\n  \n  I'll proceed with moving RIGHT to eat the apple at (6,7).\n  \n  Plan:\n  Eat (6,7). Navigate to (8,8).\n  \n  Check for immediate death moves:\n  - LEFT: (4,7) - My body. DEAD.\n  - UP: (5,8) - Safe.\n  - DOWN: (5,6) - Safe.\n  - RIGHT: (6,7) - Apple. Safe.\n  \n  Eating the apple is the goal.\n  \n  One detail: \"If I eat, I grow.\"\n  If I move to (6,7) and eat:\n  My new head: (6,7).\n  My new body: (6,7) -> (5,7) -> (4,7).\n  \n  If I don't eat:\n  My new head: (5,8).\n  My new body: (5,8) -> (5,7) -> (4,7). (Tail (4,7) moves off).\n  \n  I prefer eating.\n  \n  Final check on Snake #0.\n  Snake #0 is at (4,3).\n  If Snake #0 moves UP to (4,4).\n  I am at (5,7).\n  Distance: Manhattan distance = |5-4| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n  It's far.\n  \n  I am confident in RIGHT.\n  \n  Long-term plan text:\n  \"Eat the apple at (6,7). Move towards (8,8). Avoid Snake #0 at (4,3).\"\n  \n  Wait, the prompt says \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\" and \"You may also write a short long-term plan...\". It seems I should put the plan *after* the reasoning, before the move?\n  Actually, it says \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\" So it can be anywhere before the move.\n  \n  I will write the reasoning and then the plan, then the move.\n  \n  Structure:\n  [Reasoning about options]\n  [Plan for future]\n  RIGHT\n  \n  Let's be careful about the \"eating an apple\" part in the history.\n  If the history says I ate, but the state says I didn't (no apple at 5,7, and body length is 1), then I didn't eat.\n  The prompt says: \"My last move information... RIGHT... eating an apple.\"\n  And \"My snake (ID: 1)... Body: [(4, 7)]\".\n  If I had eaten, my body would be [(5,7), (4,7)].\n  Since my body is only [(4,7)], I did NOT eat.\n  So the \"eating an apple\" text in the \"Last Move Rationale\" is incorrect.\n  I will ignore it.\n  \n  Final decision: RIGHT.\n  \n  Plan: \"Secure the apple at (6,7). Then target the apple at (8,8). Maintain distance from Snake #0.\"Based on the current board state, I am at position (5, 7). The apple at (6, 7) is directly to my right. Moving RIGHT will allow me to eat this apple, growing my snake and increasing my score.\n\nMoving LEFT is forbidden as it would result in moving into my own body at (4, 7). Moving UP to (5, 8) or DOWN to (5, 6) are safe, but they move me away from the immediate apple. Since the goal is to collect apples and winning requires maximizing score, securing the apple at (6, 7) is the optimal play.\n\nSnake #0 is currently at (4, 3), which is far enough away that a head-on collision is impossible in the immediate turn. I will proceed with RIGHT to consume the apple.\n\nSecure the apple at (6, 7). Then plan to move towards (8, 8) or (7, 7). Monitor Snake #0 at (4, 3), but maintain current distance.\n\nRIGHT",

There is an apple at (8, 8) directly diagonally up-right.\n\nI need to check the safe moves for my head at (7, 7):\n1.  **UP**: Takes me to (7, 8). This cell is currently empty (no apples, no snake bodies). It is safe.\n2.  **DOWN**: Takes me to (7, 6). This cell is empty. It is safe.\n3.  **LEFT**: Takes me to (6, 7). This cell is currently occupied by my own body (the segment following the head). Moving here would kill me. **Unsafe**.\n4.  **RIGHT**: Takes me to (8, 7). This cell is currently empty. It is safe.\n\nNow I consider the strategic value and risks of the safe moves:\n*   **UP to (7, 8)**: This puts me at (7, 8). From here, I could reach the apple at (8, 8) next turn by moving RIGHT. I also open up paths to the top edge and the apples at (4, 9) and (8, 8). I need to be mindful of Snake #0 which is currently at (4, 5). They might move UP, but I am at x=7, so a head-on collision is unlikely unless I intercept them at the top edge. This move seems good for reaching the apple.\n*   **DOWN to (7, 6)**: This moves me towards the bottom. The nearest apple is at (9, 1), which is far. This path is currently safer from Snake #0, but it doesn't lead to an immediate apple.\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 7)**: This puts me at (8, 7). From here, I could move UP to (8, 8) to get the apple next turn. However, moving to (8, 8) might turn my body towards the right wall, potentially trapping myself against the wall if I can't loop back.\n\nComparing **UP** and **RIGHT** for the apple at (8, 8):\n*   If I go **UP** to (7, 8), I can go **RIGHT** to (8, 8) next turn. This keeps my body oriented vertically for a bit longer, which might be more flexible.\n*   If I go **RIGHT** to (8, 7), I can go **UP** to (8, 8) next turn. This creates a horizontal body segment at y=7.\n\nGiven that UP to (7, 8) seems to offer a slightly better angle to approach the apple at (8, 8) while maintaining a connection to the center/top of the board, I will choose UP. I will also prepare a plan for the next turn to secure the apple.\n\nPlan for next turn: Move RIGHT to (8, 8) to eat the apple. After eating, move LEFT or UP depending on Snake #0's position.\n\nUP",

My available moves would be LEFT or DOWN. This is a similar \"corner\" trap.\n*   If I move **DOWN** to (8, 7), I stay at x=8 but move away from the wall. This preserves the option to move RIGHT (to 9,7) or UP (to 8,8) or DOWN (to 8,6) in the future.

Let's evaluate the next step from (8, 6) to verify safety. Note: The board provided in the prompt was from the *previous* turn (Turn 13), showing my head at (8, 8). My move DOWN takes me to (8, 7). The board for Turn 14 will be generated after all moves. I must assume my move succeeds.\n\nI need to make a move for Turn 14.\nMy hypothetical position for Turn 14 is (8, 7).\nPossible moves:\n1.  **UP**: Moves to (8, 8). This is currently my tail (assuming standard growth rules, my tail moves from (6,7) to (7,7) or similar, making (8,8) free). Safe.\n2.  **DOWN**: Moves to (8, 6). Board is empty. Safe.\n3.  **LEFT**: Moves to (7, 7). My body was at (7, 7) last turn. It will shift. The new body position at (7, 7) depends on the move. If I moved DOWN to (8, 7), my old body shifts. The cell (7, 7) might be occupied by my shifting body or might be free if my tail moves away. Let's check: Old body: [(8,8), (7,8), (7,7)]. Head moves to (8,7). New body: [(8,7), (8,8), (7,8)]. The cell (7,7) becomes empty. So LEFT to (7, 7) is safe.\n4.  **RIGHT**: Moves to (9, 6). Board is empty. Safe.\n\nI am currently at x=8. Moving RIGHT to x=9 puts me against the wall. From there, I can only move UP, DOWN, or LEFT (back the way I came). Moving DOWN to (8, 6) keeps me at x=8, retaining the option to move RIGHT or LEFT later. To reach the apple at (9, 1), I will eventually have to go to x=9, but I should be careful not to get trapped. However, I can't stay at x=8 forever if I want to go to (9,1).\n\nActually, if I move **DOWN** to (8, 6), I am getting closer to the apple at (9, 1) while keeping the right wall open. If I move **RIGHT** to (9, 6), I am immediately on the wall. From (9,6), I can move DOWN to (9,5)... etc. Let's compare paths to (9,1):\nFrom (8,7): Down to (8,6), then Right to (9,6), Down to (9,5)... (Manhattan dist 9).\nFrom (8,7): Right to (9,7), Down to (9,6)... (Manhattan dist 9).\n\nPath flexibility:\nIf I go **DOWN** (to 8,6): I have neighbors (8,7), (8,5), (9,6), (7,6).\nIf I go **RIGHT** (to 9,6): I have neighbors (9,7), (9,5), (8,6).\n\nIf I go **DOWN** now, I can evaluate next turn if I want to commit to the wall. I will choose **DOWN** to maintain current flexibility and continue my descent towards the apple.\n\nWait, let me re-evaluate the board state. The board shows an apple at (9,1). The enemy snake is at (2,6).\nIf I move DOWN, I get to (8,6). From there, I can move DOWN to (8,5) and so on. This is a safe corridor.\n\nFinal decision: **DOWN**.\nEND RATIONALE\nDOWN",

It might move. (7, 6) is empty currently, so it's a candidate.\n4.  **RIGHT**: Moves to (9, 6). This is empty. However, this puts me against the wall. From (9, 6), I can only go UP, DOWN, or LEFT. If I get stuck at the wall, I might have to turn back. Descending first at x=8 keeps more options open.\n\nComparing DOWN (8, 5) and RIGHT (9, 6):\n- (8, 5) allows movement in all 4 directions (except maybe blocked by obstacles). (9, 6) restricts me to 3 directions.\n- (8, 5) is closer to the apple at (9, 1) than (8, 6) is, and maintains a safe distance from the wall until I am lower (safer to be trapped in a corner if the tail is closer).\n- I will choose **DOWN** to continue the descent safely.\n\nDOWN",

I need to secure the corner apple and then use the growth to maneuver back out.\nEND LONG-TERM PLAN\n\nTo determine the best move, I must evaluate the safety of each direction and their strategic value.\n\n1.  **Evaluate Safety:**\n    *   **Board State Analysis:** The enemy snake #0 is at (2, 8) with body at (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5). My body is at (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8).\n    *   **My Tail:** My tail is at (8, 8). My current head is (8, 5). The cell behind me is (8, 6).\n    *   **Current Moves:**\n        *   **UP:** Moves to (8, 6). This cell is currently occupied by my body. Since this is a simultaneous move turn, my tail *will* move away from (8, 6) to (8, 7) (assuming I don't eat an apple this turn, which I won't as there are none at (8, 6)). Thus, (8, 6) becomes empty. Moving UP is safe from self-collision. It is safe from enemy collision (enemy is far away).\n        *   **DOWN:** Moves to (8, 4). This cell is empty on the board. Safe.\n        *   **LEFT:** Moves to (7, 5). This cell is empty on the board. Safe.\n        *   **RIGHT:** Moves to (9, 5). This cell is empty on the board. Safe.\n\n    All four moves are technically safe from immediate death.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Strategy:**\n    *   **Goal:** The apple at (9, 1) is the closest and most valuable target.\n    *   **Current Position:** (8, 5). Target: (9, 1).\n    *   **Move Analysis:**\n        *   **UP (to 8, 6):** This is backtracking to a previous position. While safe, it reverses my progress towards (9, 1) and leaves me with a tighter squeeze later.\n        *   **LEFT (to 7, 5):** Moves me away from the target and the right wall, which I need to cross.\n        *   **RIGHT (to 9, 5):** This moves me to the wall. From (9, 5), I can still move DOWN (to 9, 4) and eventually reach (9, 1). However, being on the wall reduces maneuvering space if the snake body grows or blocks. My previous logic (in the \"last move rationale\" which referenced being at 8,6) was to descend first. Since I am now at 8,5, I am lower. I can consider moving right.\n        *   **DOWN (to 8, 4):** This continues the descent towards the y-coordinate of the apple (y=1). From (8, 4), the path to (9, 1) is a straight line right and then down. This path remains open.\n\n    *   **Comparison of DOWN vs RIGHT:**\n        *   **DOWN (8, 4):** Keeps me at x=8. If enemy snake #0 (at x=2) moves to block, I have flexibility. It guarantees a clear path to the wall later.\n        *   **RIGHT (9, 5):** Commits me to the wall. If for some reason the path down the wall is blocked (e.g., an enemy tail moves there), I might be trapped. Since I have plenty of turns (Turn 16/150) and apples, maintaining the slightly more flexible position at x=8 until y=4 is reached is safer.\n\n    *   **Decision:** I will continue descending **DOWN** to (8, 4). This sets up a clean approach to the apple at (9, 1) while keeping options open to switch to RIGHT if needed next turn.\n\nDOWN",

Safe. Opens up (7, 2) and (6, 1).\n2.  **DOWN to (7, -1):** Off board. **Illegal**.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 0):** Empty. Safe. Leads towards (3, 1).\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 0):** Contains my own body segment (which used to be the head, now the first body segment). Moving here is suicide. **Illegal**.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nThere are two safe moves: UP and LEFT.\n*   Moving **LEFT** to (6, 0) moves me closer to the apple at (3, 1). It also moves me slightly away from the enemy snake at (5, 5), reducing the chance of a head-on collision if he decides to move down or left.\n*   Moving **UP** to (7, 1) moves me towards the apple at (7, 7), but that apple is quite far (distance 6). I need to consider intermediate steps. If I go UP now, I am at (7, 1). From there, I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or UP. If I go RIGHT to (8, 1), I am near my tail at (8, 2) and (9, 2), which could be risky later.\n\nLet's look at the path to the closest apples. The apples are at (3,1) and (1,2).\n*   To (3,1): The path is (6,0) -> (5,0) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1). This seems clear.\n*   To (1,2): Path is (6,0) -> (5,0) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (2,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (1,2). This also seems clear.\n\nIf I move UP to (7,1), I am not immediately progressing towards any specific apple, although I am moving closer to the general area of (7,7) and (3,1) is still reachable.\n\nHowever, let's check the board again. The board at y=1 is:\nRow 1: `. . . A . . . . . T`\nApple at (3,1).\nMy head is at (7,0).\nIf I move LEFT to (6,0), I am on the bottom row. The bottom row (y=0) ends at x=0. The path North from the bottom row is clear (lots of empty space).\nIf I move UP to (7,1), I am at y=1. The apple at (3,1) is on this row. I could potentially go LEFT along this row: (7,1) -> (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1). However, I must be careful of my own tail. My tail is at (8,2). If I go UP to (7,1), my tail will eventually move to follow.\n\nLet's stick to the immediate goal: acquiring apples safely.\nMoving **LEFT** to (6,0) is a solid move. It puts me on the path to the apple at (3,1) and also keeps the option open to move UP later if needed. It moves me away from the enemy at (5,5).\n\nWhat about the enemy?\nEnemy at (5,5). Apple at (6,5) is right next to him. He will almost certainly move RIGHT to (6,5) to eat it. If he does, he will grow.\nIf he moves RIGHT to (6,5), and I move LEFT to (6,0), there is no immediate collision. We are far apart.\n\nLet's double check the safe moves.\nUP (7,1): Safe.\nLEFT (6,0): Safe.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer UP?\nIf I go UP, I am at (7,1). My body will be [(7,0), (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (8,2)].\nIf I go LEFT, I am at (6,0). My body will be [(7,0), (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (8,2)].\n\nWait, looking at the board state provided in the prompt:\n\"9 . . . . T . . . . .\"\n\"0 . . . . . . . 1 T T\"\nThis representation is a bit abstract. Let's map the coordinates given.\nMy body: [(8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (8, 2)] (Head at 7,0 from previous move).\nThis matches the board.\nT at (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (8,2).\nT at (8,2) means (8,2) is occupied by my tail.\nIf I move LEFT to (6,0), my new head is (6,0).\nMy body becomes [(7,0), (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (8,2)].\nAll these coordinates are distinct and valid.\n(6,0) is empty.\n(7,0) is empty (I just moved from there).\n(8,0) is empty (I moved from there to 7,0).\n(9,0) is T.\n(9,1) is T.\n(9,2) is T.\n(8,2) is T.\n\nIs there any danger at (6,0)? No.\nIs there any danger at (7,1)? No.\n\nWhy choose LEFT?\n1.  It moves towards the cluster of apples at (3,1), (1,2). The distance to (3,1) decreases from 4 to 3.\n2.  It moves away from the enemy snake at (5,5). The Manhattan distance increases.\n3.  It keeps the bottom row open for movement.\n\nWhy choose UP?\n1.  It moves towards (7,7). Distance decreases from 7 to 6.\n2.  It moves to y=1, where an apple is at (3,1). Distance from (7,1) to (3,1) is 4 (Manhattan).\n\nComparing distances to (3,1):\nFrom (7,0): Manhattan distance is |7-3| + |0-1| = 4 + 1 = 5.\nFrom (6,0): Manhattan distance is |6-3| + |0-1| = 3 + 1 = 4.\nFrom (7,1): Manhattan distance is |7-3| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4.\n\nBoth moves result in the same Manhattan distance to (3,1) after one step (4).\nHowever, moving LEFT to (6,0) allows me to approach the apple along the bottom row (y=0) until x=3, then turn UP. This avoids potential traffic at y=1 (though currently empty).\nAlso, moving LEFT keeps me in a more spacious area of the board (bottom-left corner) compared to moving UP which heads towards the center (though still open).\n\nLet's consider the \"Head-on collision\" rule. If the enemy at (5,5) moves DOWN to (5,4), and I move LEFT to (6,0), we are safe. If I move UP to (7,1), and he moves DOWN, we are safe.\n\nLet's look at the apples again.\n(6,5) is the closest apple to the enemy. He will take it.\n(0,7) is far.\n(3,1) is a good target for me.\n(1,2) is close to (3,1).\n(7,7) is a good target if I go UP.\n\nIf I go LEFT, I can get (3,1) efficiently.\nIf I go UP, I might get (7,7) eventually.\n\nLet's check the board for \"blocked\" cells around (7,0).\n- (6,0): Empty.\n- (7,1): Empty.\n\nIs there any trap?\nIf I go LEFT to (6,0):\nNext turn I can go LEFT to (5,0) or UP to (6,1).\nIf I go UP to (7,1):\nNext turn I can go LEFT to (6,1), UP to (7,2), or RIGHT to (8,1).\n(8,1) is currently empty. But (8,0) will be my body. (9,0) is body. (9,1) is body. (8,2) is body.\nIf I am at (7,1) and go RIGHT to (8,1), my body will be:\n(7,1) -> (8,1) (Head)\n(7,0) -> (7,1)\n(8,0) -> (7,0)\n(9,0) -> (8,0)\n(9,1) -> (9,0)\n(9,2) -> (9,1)\n(8,2) -> (9,2)\nThis seems safe. The cell (8,1) is empty now, and (7,0) will be empty when I leave it.\n\nHowever, I am currently in the bottom right corner of my available space (x=7, y=0).\nTo the left of me (x<7) is all empty.\nAbove me (y>0) is all empty.\nI have plenty of space.\n\nThe apples at (3,1) and (1,2) are in the bottom-left quadrant.\nThe apple at (7,7) is in the top-right quadrant.\nThe enemy is in the top-center (5,5).\n\nI am currently winning 6 to 5. I should secure points safely.\nThe apple at (3,1) seems very safe to acquire.\nI will move LEFT.\n\nWait, let's look at the map again.\n`5 . . . . T 0 A . . .`\nEnemy head at 5,5. Apple at 6,5.\nIf the enemy eats the apple at (6,5), he grows. His tail is at (4,9). He will extend.\nI am at (7,0).\nIf I move LEFT to (6,0), I am at x=6. The enemy is at x=5.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT (unlikely, since apple is at 6,5), he goes to (4,5). Safe.\nIf the enemy moves UP, DOWN, RIGHT (likely RIGHT to eat), he goes to (6,5).\n\nWhat if I move UP to (7,1)?\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (5,4), we are fine.\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (6,5), we are fine.\n\nIs there any scenario where one move is significantly safer?\nIf I move LEFT to (6,0), and the enemy somehow moves DOWN to (5,4) and then next turn moves LEFT to (4,4), etc., we are still far apart.\nIf I move UP to (7,1), and the enemy moves DOWN to (5,4), we are still far apart.\n\nDistance to safety:\nIf I go LEFT, I have the entire x=0..9, y=0..9 space available.\nIf I go UP, I have the same.\n\nLet's look at the \"Last Rationale\" from the prompt.\nIt says: \"Based on the provided board state, my head is at (8, 0), not (9, 0) as described in the 'Last Move Information' text.\"\nWait, the prompt says:\n\"Turn: 23 / 150\"\n\"Head: (7, 0)\"\n\"Body: [(8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (8, 2)]\"\nThis implies I moved LEFT in turn 22 from (8,0) to (7,0). The \"Last Move Information\" says I picked LEFT. This is consistent.\nThe \"Last Rationale\" in the prompt is a sample/example of a rationale. It mentions being at (8,0) and moving to (7,0). That rationale is describing the move I *just* made (which brought me to the current state).\nWait, the prompt says \"Your last move information: ... LEFT\". And the board shows head at (7,0). So yes, I moved left.\n\nNow I am at (7,0).\nI need to choose for turn 23.\n\nComparing LEFT (6,0) and UP (7,1):\nBoth are safe.\nLEFT moves me towards apples (3,1) and (1,2).\nUP moves me towards apple (7,7).\nThe apples at (3,1) and (1,2) are closer to the bottom of the board and form a cluster.\nThe apple at (7,7) is isolated.\nAlso, if I go UP to (7,1), I am at y=1. The board shows an apple at (3,1). This is good.\nBut if I go LEFT to (6,0), I am at y=0. I can easily go UP to (6,1) to target the apple at (3,1) or continue left.\n\nLet's trace the path to (3,1).\nPath A (Go LEFT now):\n(7,0) -> (6,0) -> (5,0) -> (4,0) -> (3,0) -> (3,1).\nPath B (Go UP now):\n(7,0) -> (7,1) -> (6,1) -> (5,1) -> (4,1) -> (3,1).\n\nBoth paths are length 5.\nHowever, Path A stays on the bottom row longer. The bottom row has no obstacles (my tail is at (8,2), moving away as I move left).\nPath B moves into the open field.\n\nLet's consider the enemy.\nEnemy at (5,5).\nIf I go LEFT, I am at (6,0). Distance to enemy is |6-5| + |0-5| = 1 + 5 = 6.\nIf I go UP, I am at (7,1). Distance to enemy is |7-5| + |1-5| = 2 + 4 = 6.\nDistance is equal.\n\nHowever, moving LEFT reduces the X distance to the enemy (from 2 to 1), but increases Y distance (from 5 to 5, wait, current distance is |7-5| + |0-5| = 7. Moving UP to (7,1) makes it 2+4=6. Moving LEFT to (6,0) makes it 1+5=6).\nSo both moves reduce the distance to the enemy by 1. But the enemy is far away.\n\nLet's look at the \"Long-term plan\".\nI need to eat apples.\nApples are at: (0,7), (6,5), (3,1), (1,2), (7,7).\n(6,5) is contested/likely eaten by enemy.\n(0,7) is very far.\n(3,1) is the closest accessible apple (5 steps).\n(1,2) is close to (3,1).\n(7,7) is 7 steps away.\n\nSo (3,1) is the primary target.\nIs there any danger in moving to (6,0)?\nNo.\nIs there any danger in moving to (7,1)?\nNo.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves to (5,4)?\nThen the distance is safe.\nWhat if the enemy moves to (6,5) (to eat apple)?\nDistance is safe.\n\nLet's look at the board layout one more time.\nTop rows (7,8,9) have T's on the right side. My tail.\nBottom rows (0,1,2) have T's on the right side. My tail.\nLeft side is open.\nCenter has enemy.\n\nI am currently at the bottom edge.\nMoving LEFT keeps me at the bottom edge.\nMoving UP moves me one row up.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6,0), I can continue to (5,0), (4,0), (3,0) then (3,1). This path seems very safe.\nIf I go UP to (7,1), I might be tempted to go RIGHT to (8,1) to loop around, but that keeps me near my tail. Or I can go LEFT to (6,1) to target (3,1).\n\nActually, let's look at the board state again.\nRow 2: `. A . . . . . . T T`\nRow 1: `. . . A . . . . . T`\nRow 0: `. . . . . . . 1 T T`\n\nThere is an apple at (1, 2).\nThere is an apple at (3, 1).\n\nIf I go LEFT, I am at (6,0).\nIf I go UP, I am at (7,1).\n\nI will choose LEFT. Why?\nBecause staying on the bottom row (y=0) provides a clean \"spine\" to move along. Once I reach x=3, I can just turn UP to (3,1).\nIf I go UP to (7,1), I am at y=1. I have to navigate around empty space. While the space is open, staying on the edge is generally a good strategy to avoid being surrounded.\n\nLet's verify \"moving backwards\".\nIf I am at (7,0), I came from (8,0).\nMy body extends to (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (8,2).\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,0), I hit my body.\nIf I go LEFT to (6,0), safe.\nIf I go UP to (7,1), safe.\nIf I go DOWN to (7,-1), dead.\n\nSo LEFT or UP.\n\nLet's check the \"Scores so far\".\nMy snake (ID 1) apples: 5.\nSnake #0 apples: 5.\nWait, the prompt says:\n\"My snake (ID: 1) ... Apples collected: 5\"\n\"Enemy snakes: Snake #0 ... Apples: 5\"\nBut then I analyzed the \"Last Move\" saying I ate an apple.\nIf I ate an apple, my score should be 6.\nLet's look at the \"Last Move Information\".\n\"START LAST MOVE PICK\nLEFT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\"\nAnd the \"Last Rationale\" says: \"LEFT is the optimal move. It secures an apple, moving my score to 5 (matching the enemy)...\"\nWait, the Rationale says \"moving my score to 5\".\nBut the current state says \"Apples collected: 5\".\nIf I just ate an apple, the score should be updated in the \"Current State\" description.\nCurrent State:\n\"- Your snake (ID 1) apples: 5\"\n\"- Snake #0 apples: 5\"\nThis suggests I did NOT eat an apple, or the score hasn't updated, or the \"Last Rationale\" is hypothetical.\nWait, the \"Last Move Information\" says \"Based on the provided board state, my head is at (8, 0), not (9, 0) as described in the 'Last Move Information' text.\"\nThis implies the \"Last Move Information\" is a text block describing what happened, and the Rationale is a text block explaining it.\nActually, looking closely at the prompt structure:\n\"Turn: 23 / 150\"\n\"Apples at: ...\"\n\"Your snake (ID: 1): ... Apples collected: 5\"\n\"Enemy snakes: ... Apples: 5\"\nThen:\n\"--Your last move information:--\"\n\"START LAST MOVE PICK\nLEFT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\"\n\"**START LAST RATIONALE**\"\n\"Based on the provided board state, my head is at (8, 0), not (9, 0)...\"\nThis last rationale seems to be describing the state *before* the move that just happened (Turn 22). It mentions head at (8,0). The current state (Turn 23) says head is at (7,0).\nSo I moved from (8,0) to (7,0) on Turn 22.\nThe board shows an apple at (7,0).\nRow 7: `A . . . T . . A . .`\nApple at (0,7), (7,7).\nWait, the board mapping in the prompt:\nRow 7: `A . . . T . . A . .`\nThis corresponds to y=7.\nMy head is at (7,0). This is y=0.\nRow 0: `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`\n`. . . . . . . 1 T T`\nSo at y=0, x=7 is '1'. x=8 is 'T', x=9 is 'T'.\nSo I am at (7,0).\nIs there an apple at (7,0)?\nThe list of apples is: `(0, 7), (6, 5), (3, 1), (1, 2), (7, 7)`.\nNone of these are (7,0).\nSo I did NOT eat an apple.\nThe \"Last Rationale\" mentioned \"LEFT is optimal... secures an apple\". That rationale was perhaps planning for the move I just made, but the apple wasn't there? Or the rationale was wrong about the apple location?\nLet's re-read the \"Last Rationale\" from the prompt text.\n\"**2. Evaluate Moves:**\n*   ... **LEFT (7, 0):** Contains an apple (+1 point). It is not occupied by any snake. **Safe.**\"\nSo the AI *thought* there was an apple at (7,0).\nBut the apple list provided in the current turn (Turn 23) does not list (7,0).\nSo either the apple list is wrong, or the rationale was wrong, or the apple was eaten.\nIf the apple was eaten, my score should be 6.\nThe prompt says \"Your snake (ID: 1) apples: 5\".\nSo I did not eat an apple.\nWhy did the rationale say \"Contains an apple\"?\nMaybe the board state in the rationale (which showed head at 8,0) had an apple at 7,0, but the *actual* current state (head at 7,0) shows no apple at 7,0 in the list.\nWait, the \"Last Move Information\" block says \"Based on the provided board state, my head is at (8, 0)...\"\nThis is describing the state at the *start* of the previous turn (Turn 22).\nAt Turn 22 start:\nHead: (8,0).\nApples list: (presumably included (7,0) if the rationale said it was there).\nThe AI moved LEFT to (7,0).\nNow it is Turn 23.\nThe prompt says \"Apples at: (0, 7), (6, 5), (3, 1), (1, 2), (7, 7)\".\nThis list does NOT include (7,0).\nThis implies that either:\n1. The apple at (7,0) was eaten (by me or someone else).\n2. There was never an apple at (7,0).\n3. The prompt is inconsistent.\n\nGiven the explicit list provided for Turn 23, I must trust the list.\nCurrent Apples: (0, 7), (6, 5), (3, 1), (1, 2), (7, 7).\nMy head: (7, 0).\nMy body: [(8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (8, 2)].\nScore: 5.\n\nSo, moving to (7,0) did NOT result in an apple.\nThis means the \"Last Rationale\" was incorrect in its assessment of the apple presence, or the apple list changed.\nRegardless, I am now at (7, 0).\nI need to move.\nOptions:\nUP (7,1): Empty.\nDOWN (7,-1): Dead.\nLEFT (6,0): Empty.\nRIGHT (8,0): My body.\n\nSafe: UP, LEFT.\n\nApples to target:\n(3,1): Distance |7-3| + |0-1| = 5.\n(1,2): Distance |7-1| + |0-2| = 8.\n(7,7): Distance |7-7| + |0-7| = 7.\n(6,5): Distance |7-6| + |0-5| = 1+5=6.\n(0,7): Distance |7-0| + |0-7| = 14.\n\nClosest is (3,1).\nDistance 5.\nTo get there, I need to decrease X and eventually increase Y.\nMoving LEFT decreases X. So LEFT is towards (3,1).\nMoving UP keeps X same, increases Y.\n(3,1) is at (3,1). (7,0) -> (6,0) -> ... -> (3,0) -> (3,1).\n(7,0) -> (7,1) -> ... -> (3,1).\nBoth are valid paths.\nHowever, moving LEFT puts me at (6,0).\nMoving UP puts me at (7,1).\n\nLet's look at the board state again to check for walls or traps.\nRow 1: `. . . A . . . . . T`\nRow 2: `. A . . . . . . T T`\nRow 3: `. . . . . . . . . .`\n...\nRow 9: `. . . . T . . . . .`\n\nThe bottom rows (0, 1, 2) have apples and obstacles on the right side (my tail).\nThe left side is open.\nMoving LEFT to (6,0) keeps me in the open left area.\nMoving UP to (7,1) moves me towards the center-top, but keeps me on the right side (x=7).\nAt (7,1), the cell to the right is (8,1), which is empty.\nAt (7,1), the cell below is (7,0), which will be my body.\nAt (7,1), the cell to the left is (6,1), empty.\nAt (7,1), the cell up is (7,2). My tail is at (8,2). (7,2) is empty.\n\nActually, looking at the board:\nRow 2 has `T T` at the end (positions 8 and 9).\nMy body includes (8,2) and (9,2).\nSo (7,2) is empty.\nIf I go UP to (7,1), then next turn UP to (7,2) is safe.\nIf I go LEFT to (6,0), then next turn UP to (6,1) is safe.\n\nLet's consider the enemy at (5,5).\nIf I go LEFT, I am at (6,0). He is at (5,5).\nIf he moves DOWN to (5,4), we are safe.\nIf he moves LEFT to (4,5), we are safe.\nIf he moves RIGHT to (6,5), we are safe.\nIf he moves UP to (5,6), we are safe.\n\nIf I go UP, I am at (7,1). He is at (5,5).\nSame logic.\n\nWhich move is better?\nLeft moves towards the apple at (3,1).\nUp moves towards the apple at (7,7) but away from (3,1) relative to X.\nWait, (7,7) is at X=7. (7,1) is X=7. So moving UP aligns with (7,7).\n(3,1) is at X=3.\nI have to decide which apple to pursue.\n(3,1) is closer (Manhattan 5) than (7,7) (Manhattan 7).\nAlso, (1,2) is close to (3,1).\nSo the bottom-left cluster seems more efficient.\nTherefore, I should move towards (3,1).\nMoving LEFT decreases X, moving towards 3.\nMoving UP does not change X.\n\nSo, LEFT is the preferred move to approach the nearest apple cluster.\n\nHowever, if I move LEFT, I am at (6,0).\nIf I move UP, I am at (7,1).\nIs there any immediate danger?\nNo.\nIs there a risk of getting trapped?\nIf I go LEFT, I have the entire bottom row and bottom-left area.\nIf I go UP, I am in the \"middle\" of the board vertically, but still on the right side x-wise.\nIf I go UP, I can still go LEFT later.\n\nLet's look at the \"Long-term plan\" requirement.\nI should probably target (3,1).\nPlan: Move towards (3,1). Once there, move to (1,2). Then maybe (7,7).\n\nWait, I should double check the \"Moving backwards\" rule.\nIf I go LEFT, my body becomes:\nHead: (6,0)\nTail: (7,0), (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (8,2).\nAll good.\nIf I go UP, my body becomes:\nHead: (7,1)\nTail: (7,0), (8,0), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (8,2).\nAll good.\n\nOne detail: The apple at (6,5) is close to the enemy. He will likely eat it.\nIf he eats it, he grows.\nDoes this affect me? Not immediately.\n\nLet's consider the \"Turn: 23 / 150\".\nWe are early-mid game.\nGrowth is good.\nEating (3,1) is the best immediate objective.\nTo get there, I should move LEFT.\n\nLet's verify the board drawing again.\nRow 0: `. . . . . . . 1 T T`\nThis is (x=0..9, y=0).\n'1' is at x=7.\nMy body is at (8,0) and (9,0).\nSo (6,0) is empty.\n(7,1) is empty.\n\nI will choose LEFT.\n\nWait, let's reconsider the apple list one last time.\nApples: (0, 7), (6, 5), (3, 1), (1, 2), (7, 7).\nIs it possible that (3,1) or (1,2) is blocked?\nBoard:\nRow 1: `. . . A . . . . . T` -> (3,1) is A.\nRow 2: `. A . . . . . . T T` -> (1,2) is A.\nSo they are there.\n\nOne final check: Snake #0 at (5,5). Body [(4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9)].\nThe enemy is a vertical line at x=4, y=5..9 (head at 5,5).\nWait, body is [(4,5), (4,6), ...]. Head is (5,5).\nSo the body is to the LEFT of the head.\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (6,5), he eats the apple.\nIf he moves UP, DOWN, or LEFT, he moves into his body or empty space?\nIf he moves LEFT to (4,5), he hits his body (which is at (4,5)). So he cannot move LEFT.\nIf he moves UP to (5,6), empty?\nIf he moves DOWN to (5,4), empty?\nIf he moves RIGHT to (6,5), apple.\n\nHe will likely move RIGHT.\nIf he moves RIGHT to (6,5), and I move LEFT to (6,0), we are at different Y levels (5 vs 0). Safe.\n\nSo, LEFT is safe and efficient.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I am at (7,0). Apples are at (0,7), (6,5), (3,1), (1,2), (7,7). The closest apple to me is at (3,1) (Manhattan distance 5).

The enemy snake is at (5, 5).\n\n1.  **Immediate Safety Analysis:**\n    *   **UP (7, 1):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (7, -1):** Off board. **ILLEGAL**.\n    *   **LEFT (6, 0):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (8, 0):** Contains my own body segment (the previous head position). **ILLEGAL**.\n\n    So, the only available moves are UP and LEFT.\n\n2.  **Strategic Analysis:**\n    *   **Targeting Apples:** The apples at (3, 1) and (1, 2) are relatively close (distances 5 and 8 respectively). The apple at (7, 7) is distance 7. The apple at (6, 5) is close to the enemy at (5, 5) and is likely to be taken by him this turn.\n    *   **Approach to (3, 1):** To reach (3, 1), I need to decrease my X coordinate. Moving **LEFT** puts me at (6, 0), directly on the path towards the bottom edge of the board under the apple, from where I can easily turn North. Moving **UP** puts me at (7, 1), which is an unnecessary vertical deviation from the most direct horizontal approach to the x=3 coordinate, unless I intend to approach from the y=1 row specifically.\n    *   **Space:** Moving LEFT keeps me at the bottom edge of the board, maintaining access to the full width of the board. Moving UP places me in the interior, which is safe now but could be less optimal if the enemy moves down.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    Moving **LEFT** is the best choice because it aligns my movement with the nearest accessible apple cluster ((3,1) and (1,2)) while maintaining safety and space.\n\nLEFT",

Tail is at `(9, 0)`.\n    *   Apples: `(3, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(0, 7)`, `(7, 7)`, `(1, 1)`.\n    *   Enemy Snake #0: Head at `(6, 7)`. Body blocks a significant area around `(5, 5)` to `(6, 6)`.\n    *   Scores: Me (5), Enemy (6). I need to catch up.\n\n2.  **Immediate Safety (Turn 26):**\n    *   **UP:** `(4, 1)` is currently empty (Board shows row 1 has apples at 1 and 3, but 4 is clear). Safe.\n    *   **DOWN:** `(4, -1)` is off the board. **DEATH**.\n    *   **LEFT:** `(3, 0)` is empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT:** `(5, 0)` is currently my body segment (specifically, the 2nd segment). **DEATH**.\n\n    **Safe moves:** UP, LEFT.\n\n3.  **Strategic Planning & Apple Targeting:**\n    *   **Closest Apples:** `(3, 1)` (dist 2) and `(1, 2)` (dist 3) are my best targets.\n    *   **Pathing:**\n        *   To get to `(3, 1)` via the shortest Manhattan path, I need to decrease X and increase Y.\n        *   If I go **UP** to `(4, 1)`: I am adjacent to the apple at `(3, 1)`. Next turn I can go LEFT to `(3, 1)` to eat. However, being on `Y=1` with a long tail at `Y=0` creates a vertical barrier. If I grow, my body will block my descent to `(0, 7)` or other lower apples later. Also, `(4, 1)` is closer to the center where the enemy might expand.\n        *   If I go **LEFT** to `(3, 0)`: I am directly under the apple at `(3, 1)`. Next turn I can go UP to `(3, 1)` to eat. This move keeps me on the bottom row `Y=0`. This is generally safer because it leaves the upper board open for maneuvering later and keeps my long tail consolidated on the bottom edge, minimizing \"trapped\" scenarios.\n\n    *   **Enemy Prediction:**\n        *   Enemy at `(6, 7)` is hunting the top apples. They have a long tail.\n        *   My move to `X=3` (LEFT) moves me further away from the enemy's current cluster at `X=5/6`, which is safer.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    *   Moving **LEFT** is the safer long-term positioning play. It approaches the `(3, 1)` apple from the optimal angle (bottom-up) and keeps my tail safe on the bottom edge of the board. Moving UP currently offers no immediate benefit over LEFT (both leave me 1 move away from an apple) but risks future congestion.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nCollect the apple at (3, 1), then pivot to the cluster at (1, 2) and (1, 1). Once those are eaten, assess the safety of moving to (0, 7) while avoiding the enemy.\n\nLEFT",

I am currently sitting on an apple (waiting to eat it).\n\n2.  **Turn 32 Analysis (Immediate Safety):**\n    *   **UP:** `(1, 3)`. The board shows empty space at this location (Row 3, Col 1 is clear, the apple is at `(3, 2)`). It is not my body. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN:** `(1, 1)`. This was my previous head position. It is immediately behind me. Moving here is moving into my own neck. **DEATH.**\n    *   **LEFT:** `(0, 2)`. Within bounds. The board shows this cell is empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT:** `(2, 2)`. Within bounds. The board shows empty space at this location. Safe.\n\n3.  **Strategic Planning:**\n    *   I am now in the lead with 9 apples (having just eaten).\n    *   I must eliminate **DOWN** as a fatal move.\n    *   I am currently at `(1, 2)`. I need to clear the space directly behind me to keep moving forward.\n    *   **Goal:** Navigate towards the cluster of apples in the upper left.\n    *   **Obstacles:** The enemy snake (#0) is at `(8, 4)` with a long body in the top-right quadrant. I am safe from them for now.\n    *   **Decision:** I need to turn. I can go **LEFT**, **UP**, or **RIGHT**. Going **UP** is the most direct path towards the apple at `(0, 7)` and keeps me away from my own body. Going **RIGHT** towards `(3, 2)` is also possible, but **UP** maintains a cleaner path with fewer potential self-collision risks in the immediate future.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove UP to clear the space behind me. I need to maneuver carefully to the left side of the board to collect the apples at (0,7) and avoid getting trapped by my own body.

My body is filling the line `x=1` from `y=0` to `y=3`. If I stay on this vertical line, I am effectively \"spooling\" rope. I need to turn away from my body to avoid trapping myself.\n    *   **Apple Proximity:**\n        *   `(0, 7)` is North-West.\n        *   `(1, 7)` is North.\n    *   **Decision:**\n        *   Moving **UP** again keeps me on the column `x=1`. This is safe for this turn, but if I keep going up, I will eventually hit the wall at `y=9` or have to turn left/right. Since my body is directly below me, going UP creates a long vertical line that I must eventually navigate around.\n        *   Moving **LEFT** to `(0, 4)` is also safe. It moves me onto a clear column and positions me directly under the apple at `(0, 7)`. This seems like the start of a better pathing strategy.\n        *   However, moving **RIGHT** to `(2, 4)` is safe and moves away from my body immediately.\n    *   **Current Preference:** I will choose **UP**. Why? Because I am currently on an apple (turn 33) and growing. The cell `(1, 5)` is open. By going UP, I maintain my vertical momentum. If I go UP, I can continue to `(1, 6)`, then turn LEFT to `(0, 6)` to line up for the apples at `(0, 7)` and `(1, 7)`. If I turn LEFT now, I'm clipping my vertical ascent. I'll prioritize clearing the column and then turning.\n\n**Strategy for next few turns:**\nGo UP to `(1, 5)`. Then continue UP to `(1, 6)` to avoid the body tail. Then turn LEFT to `(0, 6)` to approach the apple at `(0, 7)`.\n\nUP",

Note: Because I ate an apple, my tail at `(4, 0)` did *not* move, so I have effectively grown by one segment.\n    *   Enemy #0 Head: `(6, 1)`. He moved RIGHT from `(6, 2)` (or UP from `(6, 0)`? No, the map shows `0` at `(6, 1)`. Wait, looking at the board: `(6, 1)` is `0`, `(6, 2)` is `T`. The enemy `0` was at `(6, 1)` on the board. The description says he is at `(6, 1)`. He is chasing the apple at `(6, 0)`.\n    *   Apples at `(0, 7)` and `(3, 2)` are still available.\n\n2.  **Safety Check (Immediate Moves from `(1, 7)`):**\n    *   **LEFT:** Target `(0, 7)`.\n        *   Board shows `(0, 7)` is an Apple ('A').\n        *   It is not part of my body (my body starts at `(1, 6)`).\n        *   Enemy #0 is at `(6, 1)`, far away.\n        *   **Safe.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** Target `(2, 7)`.\n        *   Board shows `(2, 7)` is empty.\n        *   **Safe.**\n    *   **UP:** Target `(1, 8)`.\n        *   Board shows `(1, 8)` is empty.\n        *   **Safe.**\n    *   **DOWN:** Target `(1, 6)`.\n        *   This is my body. Moving DOWN into my body at `(1, 6)` counts as hitting myself.\n        *   **Unsafe (Death).**\n\n3.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    *   **Plan Execution:** My stated plan was to move LEFT to `(0, 7)` to eat the second apple. This fulfills the plan perfectly.\n    *   **Reward:** Moving LEFT gains an apple (+1 score).\n    *   **Future Outlook:** After eating at `(0, 7)`, I will be at `(0, 7)` with a length of 12 (assuming I started length 11). My next target will likely be the apple at `(3, 2)`.\n        *   From `(0, 7)`, I can eventually maneuver down and right. The path `(0, 6) -> (0, 5)` is currently open.\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   LEFT: +1 Apple. Follows plan. Good.\n        *   UP: Safe, but moves away from the apple at `(0, 7)`. Enemy could theoretically get it, though he is far.\n        *   RIGHT: Moves away from apples.\n        *   DOWN: Death.\n\n    *   **Enemy Analysis:** Enemy #0 is at `(6, 1)`. The apple at `(6, 0)` is below him. He must move DOWN to get it. He is not a threat to me this turn.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    *   Moving **LEFT** is the only move that scores an apple immediately. It is safe and follows the optimal path.\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to `(0, 7)` to eat the apple. On Turn 37, move DOWN to `(0, 6)` to begin descending toward the apple at `(3, 2)`.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

The board at row 3 shows `T . . T`. `(1, 3)` appears to be `.` (Empty). It is not part of my body list (my body is at `x=0` for `y>1`, and `(1,1)`). It is safe.\n    *   **RIGHT:** Target `(2, 2)`.

It is safe.\n\n3.  **Strategy:**\n    *   My current body forms a \"hook\" shape.

It is better to stay in column 1 to use the vertical space.\n\n4.  **Safety Check:**\n    *   Up `(1, 3)`: Empty (Board `.`), Not in Self, Not in Enemy (Enemy is at `x=3+`).\n    *   Right `(2, 2)`: Empty, Not in Self, Not in Enemy.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move **UP** to `(1, 3)`.

The cell `(2, 7)` is now occupied by my head.\n2.  **Board State Check**: The \"Right\" move from the previous turn was executed successfully.\n    *   Left: `(1, 7)` is occupied by my body. **Death**.\n    *   Right: `(3, 7)` is occupied by a body part (visualized as `T` at x=3, y=7). **Death**.\n    *   Up: `(2, 8)` is `T` (occupied). **Death**.\n    *   Down: `(2, 6)` is `T` (occupied). **Death**.\n\nWait, the `T` at `(2, 8)` (x=2, y=8) corresponds to `T T T` in the visual for y=8. In the previous turn rationale, I noted `(2, 7)` was empty. Now looking at the current board state for row 7: `. T 1 T T T T . . .`. This confirms that `(3, 7)` (index 3) is `T`. The visual for row 8 is `. . . T T . . . . .`. This means `(3, 8)` is `T`, `(4, 8)` is `T`. It does *not* show a `T` at `(2, 8)`. However, the previous logic stated that to escape, I *must* move Right to `x=2`. If `x=2` is now blocked by `T` (visual check: row 8 index 2 is `.`, row 9 index 2 is `.`), then the visual might have shifted or I am misinterpreting the board.\n\nLet's look closer at the current board state provided in the prompt.\nRow 7: `7 . T 1 T T T T . . .`\nIndex 0: (0,7) `.` Index 1: (1,7) `T` (My tail/body) Index 2: (2,7) `1` (Me) Index 3: (3,7) `T` Index 4: (4,7) `T` ...\n\nRow 8: `8 . . . T T . . . . .`\nIndex 0: (0,8) `.` Index 1: (1,8) `.` Index 2: (2,8) `.` Index 3: (3,8) `T` ...\n\nRow 9: `9 . A . . . . . . . A`\nIndex 0: (0,9) `.` Index 1: (1,9) `A` ...\n\nSo, `(2, 8)` is `.` (Empty). `(2, 6)` is `T` (Row 6: `. T T T . . 0 . . .`, Index 2 is `T`).\n\nSo:\n- Up `(2, 8)`: **Safe**.\n- Left `(1, 7)`: **Unsafe** (Body).\n- Right `(3, 7)`: **Unsafe** (Body).\n- Down `(2, 6)`: **Unsafe** (Body).\n\nI am effectively pinned against my own body and the wall/trap structure.\n\n**Decision**:\n- **UP** to `(2, 8)` is the only valid move.\n- From `(2, 8)`, I will be at y=8.\n- Row 8: `. . . T T . . . . .`\n- `(3, 8)` is `T`.\n- `(2, 8)` is empty.\n- `(1, 8)` is empty.\n- `(2, 9)` is `.`.\n- `(1, 9)` is `A`. (Apple!)\n- Moving UP places me near the apple at `(1, 9)` and keeps me alive.\n\n**Long-term Plan**:\nSurvive the immediate trap. From `(2, 8)`, check if I can move LEFT to `(1, 8)` or UP to `(2, 9)`. I am trying to eat the apple at `(1, 9)`.\n\nMove: UP.\n\nUP",

From `(2, 9)`, I can potentially move LEFT to `(1, 9)` next turn to eat it.\n\n5.  **Enemy Snake #0**:\n    *   Head: `(6, 5)`.\n    *   It is far away. The `T`s visible in the grid (like `(3, 8)`, `(3, 7)`, etc.) are remnants of its body from previous turns, but the head is at `(6, 5)`.\n    *   There is no immediate threat of head-on collision from Snake #0.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nBoth LEFT and UP are safe moves. UP moves me closer to the apple at `(1, 9)` and positions me on the top edge of the board, which is generally safer than staying at `y=8` where I might get squeezed later.

My body extends upwards from `(0, 8)` to `(0, 9)` and then turns right. The cell directly above `(0, 7)` is `(0, 8)`, which is the second segment of my body. This means moving **UP** is illegal (self-collision).\n3.  **Analyzing Moves**:\n    *   **UP**: `(0, 8)` is occupied by my body. **DEAD**.\n    *   **LEFT**: `x=-1` is out of bounds. **DEAD**.\n    *   **RIGHT**: `(1, 7)`. According to the text board, this cell contains a `T`. Looking at my body list, `(1, 7)` is indeed present. Therefore, moving **RIGHT** is illegal (self-collision). **DEAD**.\n    *   **DOWN**: `(0, 6)`. This cell is on the board. It is empty on the text board (`.`). It is not in my body list (which contains `... (1, 2), (1, 3)...` upwards). It is not in the enemy snake's body list (which is mostly around x=6, and ends at `(2, 5)`). It is not an apple. It is safe.\n\n**Strategy**:\nI am continuing my descent down the left column. The target apple is at `(0, 5)`. The move **DOWN** brings me closer to it. I must check the turn order and potential enemy moves. My only legal move is DOWN.\n\n**Immediate Threat Check**:\nSnake #0 is at `(6, 0)`. If Snake #0 moves UP to `(6, 1)` or LEFT to `(5, 0)`, I am safe. If Snake #0 moves DOWN (suicide) or RIGHT (suicide), I win immediately. The only dangerous move for Snake #0 that affects me is if Snake #0 moves to `(0, 6)`. Since Snake #0 is at `(6, 0)`, the Manhattan distance to `(0, 6)` is 12. In a single turn, a snake can move at most 1 unit distance. Therefore, Snake #0 cannot reach `(0, 6)` this turn. My move **DOWN** to `(0, 6)` is safe.\n\n**Conclusion**: DOWN is the only legal and safe move.\n\nDOWN",

The apple at (2, 2) is immediately below, but eating it creates a risk of trapping myself against the wall if an enemy blocks the escape. I will prioritize navigating safely towards the cluster of apples at (7, 7), (7, 8), and (9, 9). This path utilizes the center of the board, offering more maneuvering room. I must remain vigilant of Snake #0's position to avoid head-on collisions.\nEND LONG-TERM PLAN\n\nSTART RATIONALE\n1.  **Board State**: My head is at (2, 3). My body occupies (1, 3) and fills the leftmost column. Apples are at (9, 9), (2, 2), (7, 8), (7, 7), and (3, 3).\n2.  **Move Analysis**:\n    *   **UP**: (2, 4). Based on the provided board map, row 4, columns 0-6 are marked 'T' (Tempting/Territory), and specifically (2, 4) corresponds to the 'T' in the row labeled '4'. This indicates a blocked cell, likely part of Snake #0's body (or a wall in the visual map). Even if it were empty, moving Up isolates me near the top wall, reducing future mobility.\n    *   **DOWN**: (2, 2). This cell contains an apple ('A'). However, moving here risks trapping myself. My body extends up to (2, 3) and left to (1, 3). To survive eating this apple, I would need to move right on the next turn (to 3,2) and then likely Up (to 3,3) or Down. If Snake #0 moves to block (3, 2) or (3, 3), I am dead. It is safer to skip this apple for now.\n    *   **LEFT**: (1, 3). This cell is occupied by my own body. Moving here results in immediate death.\n    *   **RIGHT**: (2, 4). Wait, I must check the map again. The row labeled '3' shows `T T 1 A . . T T . .`. My head is at (2, 3). The apple is at (3, 3). The map shows `(2, 4)` as a `T` in the row `4` visual. However, looking at the row `3` description, it ends with `T T` at (7,3) and (8,3). Row `4` starts with `T` at (0,4). The map is a bit dense. Let's re-evaluate the `RIGHT` move: (2, 4). The visual map for row 4 shows `T . . . . . T T . .`. The 'T's are at indices 0, 6, and 7. Index 2 is a dot. **Correction**: The row 4 map is `T . . . . . T T . .`. This means (2, 4) is **Safe** (Empty).\n    *   Re-evaluating **UP** to (2, 4): The map shows row 4 as `T . . . . . T T . .`. This means (2, 4) is empty. Wait, looking at the coordinates: 0 is bottom, 9 is top. Row 4 is the 5th row from the bottom. The visual map shows `T . . . . . T T . .` for row 4. This means (2, 4) is a `.` (Safe). I confused myself with the visual alignment. Let's look at the actual text provided: `4 T . . . . . T T . .`. Yes, column 2 is `.`.\n    *   **UP (Re-evaluated)**: Target (2, 4). The map shows `.` (Empty). This is **Safe**.\n    *   **RIGHT (Re-evaluated)**: Target (3, 4). The map shows `.` (Empty). This is **Safe**.\n    *   **DOWN (Re-evaluated)**: Target (2, 2). Contains Apple 'A'. **Safe**.\n3.  **Decision**:\n    *   I must avoid LEFT.\n    *   I want to move towards the center/top to chase the larger apples ((7,7), (7,8), (9,9)).\n    *   Moving **UP** to (2, 4) keeps me on the path to the center without exposing me to immediate threats. It avoids the tight spot at (2, 2).\n    *   Moving RIGHT is also safe, but UP aligns better with the path to (7,7) and keeps distance from the wall slightly better.\n4.  **Enemy Safety**: Snake #0 is at (7, 5). Moving to (2, 4) is far away.\nEND RATIONALE\n\nUP",

This is confusing. The prompt text explicitly says \"Head: (2, 4)\" and the \"START LAST MOVE\" says I just moved UP to (2, 4). If I am at (2, 4), looking at the map provided: `4 T . . . . . T T . .` (Wait, the prompt visual has `T . 1 . . .` at row 4). Let's look at the board description again: `4 T . 1 . . . T T . .`. This implies (2, 4) is `1`. If I just moved UP to (2, 4), that matches. However, the map legend says `.` is empty. If `1` is there, it's me.\n        *   Let's assume the visual map provided is the *current* state with me at (2, 4) denoted by `1`.\n        *   **LEFT:** (1, 4). The map shows `.` at index 1 for row 4. **Safe**.\n        *   **RIGHT:** (3, 4). The map shows `.` at index 3 for row 4. **Safe**.\n        *   **UP:** (2, 5). The map for row 5 is `T . . . . . T T . .`. Index 2 is `.`. **Safe**.\n\n3.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    *   **Goal:** Reach (3, 3) (Apple) -> (7, 7) (Apple).\n    *   **Current Position:** (2, 4).\n    *   **Snake #0 Threat:** Located at (7, 6). Its body blocks the path to (7, 7) from the bottom and right. I likely need to approach from the left or top.\n    *   **Option Analysis:**\n        *   **RIGHT to (3, 4):** This gets me closer to (3, 3) (Apple). If I go Right to (3, 4), I can then go Down to (3, 3) to eat the apple. (3, 3) is currently safe (it's an apple). My tail will move away from (2, 3) next turn, clearing the path for me to enter (3, 3) without hitting myself (unless I eat and grow, then the tail stays, but since I enter an empty spot (3,4) now, it's safe). This is a strong move to secure an apple.\n        *   **UP to (2, 5):** Moves away from (3, 3). (2, 5) is empty. From (2, 5), I can go Right to (3, 5).\n        *   **LEFT to (1, 4):** Moves towards the wall. (1, 4) is empty. This might be safe but leads towards a potential dead end near the top-left, or requires navigating around my own tail which is at (0, 9) etc. It does not seem as productive as going towards (3, 3).\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    *   **RIGHT** is the best move. It moves towards the apple at (3, 3).\n    *   Is (3, 4) safe? The map visual `4 T . 1 . . . T T . .` has a `1` at index 2. The dots are at index 1 and 3. So (3, 4) is `.`. Safe.\n    *   Is there a risk of collision with Snake #0? Snake #0 is at (7, 6). It moves one step. It cannot reach me at (3, 4) this turn.\n    *   Is there a risk of moving into Snake #0's body? No, its body is at x=6 and y=7. I am at x=3.\n    *   Is there a risk of head-on collision? Snake #0 is far away.\n\n    *   Let's double check the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" from the prompt. It says \"Re-evaluating UP to (2, 4)... The map shows row 4 as `T . . . . . T T . .`. This means (2, 4) is **Safe**\". This contradicts the provided board state visual `4 T . 1 . . . T T . .`. However, the \"My snake\" section says Head is at (2, 4). If the visual map in the prompt is strictly followed, (2, 4) is `1`. If the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" text is followed, (2, 4) is `.`.\n    *   Given the conflict, I must trust the textual description of my snake's position over the visual ASCII map which might be slightly stale or formatted differently. However, the text says \"My head is at (2, 4)\".\n    *   Let's look at Row 4 visual again: `4 T . 1 . . . T T . .`\n        Columns: 0(T), 1(.), 2(1), 3(.), 4(.), 5(.), 6(T), 7(T), 8(.), 9(.).\n        If I am at (2, 4), and the map says (2, 4) is `1`, that's consistent.\n        If I am at (2, 4), (3, 4) is `.`.\n    \n    *   Let's reconsider the **RIGHT** move to (3, 4).\n        Is (3, 4) actually safe?\n        The map `4 T . 1 . . . T T . .` shows (3, 4) is `.`.\n        Is there any other snake at (3, 4)? No.\n        Is there my body at (3, 4)? No.\n        So **RIGHT** is safe.\n\n    *   Let's reconsider the **UP** move to (2, 5).\n        Row 5: `T . . . . . T T . .` -> `.` at (2, 5).\n        **UP** is safe.\n\n    *   Let's reconsider **LEFT** to (1, 4).\n        Row 4: `T . 1 . . . T T . .` -> `.` at (1, 4).\n        **LEFT** is safe.\n\n    *   Let's reconsider **DOWN** to (2, 3).\n        My body is at (2, 3).\n        **DOWN** is death.\n\n    *   **Strategy:**\n        I want to get to (3, 3).\n        From (2, 4), moving **RIGHT** gets me to (3, 4). From there, I can go DOWN to (3, 3) to eat the apple.\n        If I go UP to (2, 5), I am moving away from the immediate apple at (3, 3).\n        If I go LEFT, I am moving away from apples.\n        \n        However, Snake #0 is at (7, 6). Its body occupies (6, 6). If I go RIGHT to (3, 4), I am getting closer to the center, but still far from the enemy.\n        \n        Wait, looking at Row 3: `T T T A . . T T . .`\n        Row 4: `T . 1 . . . T T . .`\n        \n        The apple at (3, 3) is directly \"down-right\" of my head (2, 4)? No, (3, 3) is Down-Right? No. (2, 4) -> (3, 4) is Right. (3, 4) -> (3, 3) is Down.\n        \n        Let's check if (3, 3) is safe to enter.\n        (3, 3) is an apple. It is currently occupied by an apple. Snakes can move into apples.\n        Is there a snake body at (3, 3)? No, the map says `A`.\n        Is there an enemy snake head that might move there? Snake #0 is at (7, 6).\n        \n        There is one subtlety. Snake #0 is at (7, 6). It might move UP (to 7,7) or LEFT (to 6,6) or RIGHT (to 8,6) or DOWN (to 7,5).\n        If it moves UP to (7, 7), it eats an apple.\n        It cannot reach me.\n        \n        Let's look at the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" again. It claims \"UP (Re-evaluated)... Safe\" and \"RIGHT (Re-evaluated)... Safe\". It chose UP.\n        Why did it choose UP?\n        \"Moving UP to (2, 4) keeps me on the path to the center/top without exposing me to immediate threats. It avoids the tight spot at (2, 2).\"\n        \n        I am currently at (2, 4). The \"tight spot\" is (2, 2). Going DOWN would go to (2, 3) then (2, 2). I am not going DOWN.\n        \n        The choice is between UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n        The rationale in the prompt chose UP to go to (2, 4). But I am *already* at (2, 4) according to the turn start.\n        \n        The prompt says: \"Turn: 66... Head: (2, 4)\".\n        \n        So I am at (2, 4).\n        I need to move to (2, 5), (1, 4), (3, 4), or (2, 3).\n        \n        If I go RIGHT to (3, 4), I am moving towards the apple at (3, 3) and generally towards the center.\n        If I go UP to (2, 5), I am moving towards the top wall.\n        If I go LEFT to (1, 4), I am moving towards the left wall.\n        \n        The apple at (3, 3) is very close. Snakes usually prioritize food if it is safe.\n        \n        Let's check if (3, 3) is reachable.\n        Turn 66: Move RIGHT to (3, 4).\n        Turn 67: Move DOWN to (3, 3) (Eat Apple). My tail moves, so (2, 4) becomes empty.\n        \n        Is (3, 4) currently safe?\n        Map: `T . 1 . . . T T . .` (Row 4). Index 3 is `.`.\n        \n        Is there any risk of Snake #0 moving into (3, 4)?\n        Snake #0 is at (7, 6).\n        To reach (3, 4) in one turn: Manhattan distance is (7-3) + (6-4) = 4+2=6. Max speed is 1. Impossible.\n        \n        So RIGHT is safe and good.\n        \n        Is UP safe?\n        Map: Row 5 `T . . . . . T T . .`. Index 2 is `.`.\n        Distance to Snake #0: (7-2)+(6-5)=5+1=6. Safe.\n        \n        Is LEFT safe?\n        Map: Row 4 `T . 1 . . . T T . .`. Index 1 is `.`.\n        Distance to Snake #0: (7-1)+(6-4)=6+2=8. Safe.\n        \n        Why choose RIGHT over UP/LEFT?\n        The apple at (3, 3) is to the \"South-East\" of my current position (2, 4).\n        (3, 3) is South-East of (2, 4)? No.\n        (2, 4) -> (3, 3) is (x+1, y-1).\n        I can't move diagonally.\n        To get there, I need to go RIGHT then DOWN, or DOWN then RIGHT.\n        If I go DOWN now (to 2, 3), I hit my body.\n        So I must go RIGHT first.\n        \n        If I go UP, I can go RIGHT next turn to (3, 5), then DOWN, DOWN, LEFT? No, that's inefficient.\n        If I go UP, I am moving away from the low hanging fruit at (3, 3).\n        \n        However, I must check the board state `4 T . 1 . . . T T . .`. This suggests (0,4) is 'T'. (1,4) is '.'.\n        Row 5: `T . . . . . T T . .`\n        \n        Let's look at the \"Scores so far\". I have 13, Snake #0 has 16. I am behind.\n        Eating an apple is a good idea if safe.\n        \n        Is there any reason NOT to go RIGHT?\n        Maybe there is a trap? But the map shows open space to the right until column 6.\n        \n        Let's verify the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" logic again.\n        It says: \"Moving UP to (2, 4)... keeps me on the path to the center/top\".\n        It says: \"RIGHT (Re-evaluated): Target (3, 4). The map shows `.` (Empty). This is Safe.\"\n        It says: \"Decision: I must avoid LEFT. I want to move towards the center/top... Moving UP to (2, 4)... aligns better with the path to (7,7).\"\n        \n        Wait, the previous turn's rationale ended with \"UP\". But I am at (2, 4). So the previous move worked.\n        Now I am at (2, 4).\n        \n        The prompt asks me to make a new decision.\n        \n        Let's re-read the specific part of the prompt:\n        \"My head is at (2, 4)\"\n        \"Apples at: (3, 3)\"\n        \n        The plan is: (3, 3) -> (7,7).\n        \n        To get to (7, 7), I need to go generally Right and Up.\n        Currently at (2, 4). Target (3, 3).\n        Target (3, 3) is Down-Right relative to (2, 4)?\n        (2, 4) -> (3, 4) is Right.\n        (3, 4) -> (3, 3) is Down.\n        \n        So moving Right now is the first step to (3, 3).\n        \n        Is there any danger from Snake #0?\n        Snake #0 is at (7, 6).\n        If Snake #0 moves UP, it goes to (7, 7).\n        If Snake #0 moves DOWN, it goes to (7, 5).\n        If Snake #0 moves LEFT, it goes to (6, 6).\n        If Snake #0 moves RIGHT, it goes to (8, 6).\n        \n        None of these intersect with (3, 4).\n        \n        What about my own body?\n        My body is at (2, 3), (1, 3)...\n        If I move RIGHT to (3, 4), I am not hitting myself.\n        \n        What about the \"long term plan\"?\n        \"Move towards (3, 3)\".\n        \n        If I move UP to (2, 5), I am moving away from (3, 3).\n        \n        If I move LEFT to (1, 4), I am moving away from (3, 3).\n        \n        So RIGHT seems the logical move to follow the plan.\n        \n        Let's double check the map one last time to ensure I am not hallucinating the `.`.\n        Board State text:\n        `9 T T T . . . . . . A`\n        `8 T . T . . . . A . .`\n        `7 T . T . T T T A . .`\n        `6 T . . . . . T 0 . .`\n        `5 T . . . . . T T . .`\n        `4 T . 1 . . . T T . .`  <-- My head is at index 2 (x=2).\n        `3 T T T A . . T T . .`  <-- Apple at index 3 (x=3).\n        `2 . . A . . . T T . .`\n        \n        So:\n        Row 4: `T . 1 . . . T T . .`\n        Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n        Values:  T . 1 . . . T T . .\n        \n        (3, 4) corresponds to index 3, which is `.`.\n        So (3, 4) is empty.\n        \n        Row 5: `T . . . . . T T . .`\n        (2, 5) corresponds to index 2, which is `.`.\n        \n        Row 3: `T T T A . . T T . .`\n        (1, 3) is `T` (part of my body). (0, 3) is `T` (my body). (2, 3) is my body (head was at 2,4). (3, 3) is `A` (Apple).\n        \n        So moving RIGHT to (3, 4) is safe.\n        Moving UP to (2, 5) is safe.\n        Moving LEFT to (1, 4) is safe.\n        \n        Why did the previous rationale suggest UP?\n        \"Moving UP aligns better with the path to (7,7)\".\n        Let's see.\n        Target (7, 7).\n        Current (2, 4).\n        Path: (3, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 5) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 7).\n        That's mostly Right, then Up.\n        \n        Target (3, 3).\n        Path: (3, 4) -> (3, 3).\n        \n        Target (7, 8) or (9, 9).\n        \n        If I go UP to (2, 5), I have to come back Down to get (3, 3).\n        If I go RIGHT to (3, 4), I can get (3, 3) next.\n        \n        Is (3, 3) worth getting?\n        It gives me +1 point. Total 14.\n        Snake #0 has 16.\n        \n        Is there any risk in eating (3, 3)?\n        If I move to (3, 4) now (Turn 66).\n        Then Move to (3, 3) (Turn 67) -> Eat. Tail stays at (2, 3) (wait, no, if I eat, I don't lose the tail).\n        My current body: Head (2, 4) -> (2, 3) -> ...\n        If I move RIGHT to (3, 4):\n        New Head (3, 4).\n        New Body: (2, 4), (2, 3), ...\n        Tail stays at (0, 9) (approx).\n        \n        If I then move DOWN to (3, 3):\n        New Head (3, 3).\n        New Body: (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 3) ...\n        Is (3, 4) empty? Yes (it was just my head). Is (2, 4) empty? Yes (it becomes body part). Is (2, 3) empty? Yes (it becomes body part).\n        Is (3, 3) an apple? Yes.\n        Is (3, 3) safe? Yes.\n        \n        There is no collision issue.\n        \n        Is there an issue with Snake #0?\n        Turn 66: S0 moves. S1 (Me) moves to (3, 4).\n        Turn 67: S0 moves. S1 moves to (3, 3).\n        S0 is far away.\n        \n        So RIGHT is a safe and productive move.\n        \n        Let's consider if Snake #0 might be a threat later.\n        S0 is at (7, 6). It has a long body.\n        My body is at the left wall.\n        \n        If I go UP to (2, 5), I am closer to the top wall. The top wall is a hazard.\n        If I go RIGHT to (3, 4), I am more central.\n        \n        However, the \"START LONG-TERM PLAN\" says \"Move towards (3, 3)\".\n        \n        I will execute RIGHT.\n        \n        Wait, let's check the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" text again.\n        It says: \"The map shows (2, 4) is **Safe**.\"\n        It says: \"Re-evaluating **RIGHT** to (3, 4)... This is **Safe**.\"\n        It says: \"**Decision**: ... Moving **UP** to (2, 4) keeps me on the path... aligns better with the path to (7,7).\"\n        \n        Wait, the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" is about the *previous* move (Turn 65 -> Turn 66).\n        It moved UP to (2, 4). That was the correct move for that turn.\n        \n        Now I am at (2, 4). I need to decide Turn 66 -> Turn 67.\n        \n        The previous rationale ended with \"UP\". That was the move that got me to (2, 4).\n        Now I am at (2, 4).\n        \n        The prompt asks me to think about the *current* turn.\n        \n        The \"START LONG-TERM PLAN\" in my response (the one I am generating now) should guide me.\n        \"Move towards (3, 3)\".\n        \n        Moving RIGHT gets me to (3, 4), which is adjacent to (3, 3).\n        Moving UP gets me to (2, 5), which is further from (3, 3).\n        Moving LEFT gets me to (1, 4), further from (3, 3).\n        \n        So RIGHT is the best.\n        \n        Wait, is there a reason to avoid (3, 3)?\n        Maybe Snake #0 can get there?\n        Snake #0 is at (7, 6).\n        Distance to (3, 3) is 4 (x) + 3 (y) = 7.\n        I am at distance 2 (from 2,4 to 3,3 is 1 step? No. (2,4) -> (3,4) -> (3,3) is 2 steps).\n        So I can get there in 2 turns.\n        S0 needs 7 turns (minimum).\n        So I am safe.\n        \n        However, I must check if S0 can block my escape path after I eat.\n        If I eat at (3, 3) on Turn 67, I will be at (3, 3).\n        My body will be (3, 4), (2, 4), ...\n        To escape, I need to move to (4, 3), (3, 2), (2, 3), or (3, 4).\n        (3, 4) is occupied by my body (the segment behind the head).\n        (2, 3) is occupied by my body.\n        (3, 2) is empty (Row 2: `. . A . . . T T . .` -> (3,2) is `A`? No, (2,2) is A. (3,2) is `.`).\n        (4, 3) is empty (Row 3: `T T T A . . T T . .` -> (4,3) is `.`).\n        \n        So after eating, I can move DOWN to (3, 2) or RIGHT to (4, 3).\n        \n        If I move DOWN to (3, 2), I am at an apple (Row 2: `. . A . . . T T . .` -> (3,2) is `.`? Wait, let's check Row 2 again.\n        `2 . . A . . . T T . .`\n        Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n        (2, 2) is A (index 2).\n        (3, 2) is `.` (index 3).\n        \n        So (3, 2) is safe.\n        \n        There are no threats.\n        \n        So I will move RIGHT.\n        \n        One final check: The prompt mentions \"Snake #0 - Head: (7, 6)\". The visual map shows `0` at (7, 6). The body is at (7, 5), (7, 4)... and (6, 6), (6, 5)...\n        The map shows `T` for body parts.\n        Row 6: `T . . . . . T 0 . .`\n        Row 7: `T . T .

T T . .`\n        \n        So S0's body is at:\n        (7, 6) (Head)\n        (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0)\n        (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)\n        (5, 7), (4, 7)\n        \n        My path to (3, 3) goes through (3, 4). This is nowhere near S0.\n        \n        So RIGHT is the optimal move.\n        \n        Wait, looking at the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" in the prompt text again:\n        It says \"Moving UP to (2, 4)... aligns better with the path to (7,7)\".\n        And it chose UP.\n        But I am now at (2, 4).\n        The prompt asks me to choose the NEXT move.\n        The prompt says \"Turn: 66 / 150\".\n        \n        Let's assume the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" in the prompt is describing the logic for the move that *got* me to (2, 4). That move was UP. That is correct.\n        Now I am at (2, 4). I need to make the move for Turn 66.\n        \n        The plan is (3, 3) -> (7,7).\n        So (3, 3) is the immediate target.\n        (3, 4) is the intermediate step.\n        \n        Is there any danger in going to (3, 4)?\n        No.\n        \n        Is there any danger in going UP or LEFT?\n        No. But they are not optimal.\n        \n        So I choose RIGHT.\n        \n        Wait, I should check if the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" text in the prompt is actually part of the *current* state description, or if it is describing the *previous* move.\n        The text says: \"--Your last move information:--\"\n        And then \"START LAST MOVE PICK: UP\"\n        And \"START LAST RATIONALE: ... Re-evaluating UP to (2, 4) ... This is Safe. ... Decision: ... Moving UP ...\".\n        \n        So the last move was UP. I am now at (2, 4).\n        \n        So my decision for this turn is independent of that, except for context.\n        \n        Final verification of safety of (3, 4):\n        Row 4: `T . 1 . . . T T . .`\n        My head is at `1` (index 2).\n        Index 3 is `.`.\n        This is correct.\n        \n        Final verification of safety of (2, 5):\n        Row 5: `T . . . . . T T . .`\n        Index 2 is `.`.\n        This is correct.\n        \n        Final verification of safety of (1, 4):\n        Row 4: `T . 1 . . . T T . .`\n        Index 1 is `.`.\n        This is correct.\n        \n        I will choose RIGHT.\n        \n        Wait, one tiny detail. The prompt says \"Apples at: (9, 9), (2, 2), (7, 8), (7, 7), (3, 3)\".\n        Is (3, 3) definitely the one to go for?\n        It is the closest.\n        \n        What about (2, 2)? It is at (2, 2).\n        I am at (2, 4).\n        (2, 3) is my body.\n        (2, 2) is the apple.\n        I cannot go DOWN because of my body.\n        So (2, 2) is blocked for this turn.\n        To get it, I'd have to loop around, which is risky.\n        \n        So (3, 3) is the best choice.\n        \n        Decision: RIGHT.\n        \n        Wait, let me re-read the map visual one more time.\n        `4 T . 1 . . . T T . .`\n        `3 T T T A . . T T . .`\n        `5 T . . . . . T T . .`\n        \n        If I move RIGHT, I go to (3, 4).\n        If Snake #0 moves DOWN, it goes to (7, 5).\n        If Snake #0 moves LEFT, it goes to (6, 6).\n        If Snake #0 moves UP, it goes to (7, 7).\n        If Snake #0 moves RIGHT, it goes to (8, 6).\n        \n        None of these intersect with (3, 4).\n        \n        So it's safe.\n        \n        What if Snake #0 moves into my body?\n        My body parts are at (2, 3), (1, 3), ...\n        Snake #0 is at (7, 6).\n        It can't reach my body in one turn.\n        \n        So I am safe.\n        \n        Final check: \"Rules and win conditions... If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\"\n        This means if S0 hits my body, I survive. But S0 is too far to hit my body.\n        \n        So the only danger is me hitting S0 or my own body.\n        \n        I will move RIGHT.\n        \n        One more thing.\n        The prompt mentions \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n        \"Decreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\"\n        \"Decreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\"\n        \n        My head is (2, 4).\n        RIGHT -> (3, 4). Correct.\n        UP -> (2, 5). Correct.\n        LEFT -> (1, 4). Correct.\n        DOWN -> (2, 3). Correct (and death).\n        \n        I am confident in RIGHT.\n        \n        Wait, I should consider if (3, 4) is actually \"T\" (Tempting) in the visual map?\n        The visual map for row 4 is `T . 1 . . . T T . .`.\n        The `.` at index 3 is empty.\n        The `T` at index 0 is \"Tempting\". The `T` at index 6 and 7 are \"Tempting\".\n        So (3, 4) is not \"T\".\n        \n        It is safe.\n        \n        I will write the response now.\n        \n        START LONG-TERM PLAN\n        Move to (3, 3) to eat the apple, then navigate to (7, 7) and (7, 8).\n        END LONG-TERM PLAN\n        \n        START RATIONALE\n        1.  **Current State**: Head at (2, 4). Body at (2, 3).\n        2.  **Target**: The apple at (3, 3) is the closest and safest target to gain points and catch up to Snake #0.\n        3.  **Move Analysis**:\n            *   **DOWN**: Hits my own body at (2, 3). **Death**.\n            *   **UP**: Safe, but moves away from the apple at (3, 3).\n            *   **LEFT**: Safe, but moves away from the apple at (3, 3).\n            *   **RIGHT**: Moves to (3, 4). The map confirms this cell is empty (`.`). This is the first step towards reaching (3, 3) next turn. It maintains momentum towards the center and the nearest apple.\n        4.  **Safety**: Snake #0 is at (7, 6) and cannot reach (3, 4) this turn. My body is not blocking (3, 4).\n        END RATIONALE\n        \n        RIGHT",

Move towards the apple cluster at (2,2), (4,1), and (3,3).\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\n**START RATIONALE**\n1.  **Current State**: My head is at (4, 4). My body immediately follows at (3, 4).\n2.  **Immediate Threats**: There is a gap of one cell between my head (4,4) and the potential approach of Snake #0's head at (7,8). Snake #0 is targeting the right side of the board, specifically the gap at (5,4) leading to the apple at (6,4)? No, Snake #0's head is at (7,8) and it has a gap at (8,8). However, if Snake #0 moves Left to (6,8), it controls the column 6. If it moves Down, it hits its own body at (7,7). If it moves Right, it dies at (9,8). So it will likely move Left to (6,8) or Up to (7,9).\n    More importantly, looking at the spot (5,4): This is empty. If I move Right to (5,4), I might be moving into a collision course if Snake #0 decides to rush for the apples in the center. But Snake #0 is far away.\n    The critical logic from the previous turn was that (4,4) has body at (3,4) and (5,4) is empty. The coordinates are (4,4). The body is at (3,4). The gap is at (5,4). The board state shows `1 . T T` at row 4, col 4. The cell to the right (5,4) is empty.\n    Wait, looking at Snake #0's body: It ends at (4,7). This is very close to my head at (4,4). It is 3 units away vertically.\n    If I move Right to (5,4), I am moving away from Snake #0's body.\n    If I move Up to (4,5), I am moving towards Snake #0's body tail at (4,7).\n    If I move Down to (4,3), I hit my own body at (3,3)? No, my body is at (3,4). Wait, my body is at (3,4) and (2,4). If I move Down to (4,3), I check the map. Row 3 shows `A . . T T`. (4,3) is empty. But I must check if (4,3) connects to my body. My body is at (3,4). They are not adjacent. So (4,3) is empty. Is it safe? Yes.\n    However, the most important constraint is the apple at (3,3). To reach it from (4,4), I need to go Left to (3,4) or Down to (4,3) then Left.\n    But (3,4) is my own body.\n    So I cannot go Left.\n    To get to (3,3), I must go Down to (4,3), then Left to (3,3).\n    Let's check safety of (4,3): My body is at (3,4), (2,4), etc. (4,3) is not on my body.\n    Enemy #0 body is at (4,7) downwards. (4,3) is not on enemy body.\n    So DOWN is safe.\n    Is UP safe? (4,5). My body? No. Enemy body? (4,7) is the closest. (4,5) is empty. But Snake #0 might move Down. If Snake #0 moves Down to (7,7), it hits its body. It won't.\n    If I move UP, I get closer to the enemy but away from the apple (3,3).\n    If I move DOWN, I get closer to the apple (3,3).\n    If I move RIGHT, I move away from the apple (3,3).\n    Target is (3,3).\n    Path: (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (3,3).\n    So DOWN is the correct move towards the target.\n    Let's re-evaluate the board map for Row 4: `T . T T 1 . T T . .`\n    Col 4 is `1` (my head).\n    Col 5 is `.` (empty).\n    Col 3 is `T` (Wait, let's look at the map again).\n    Row 4: `T . T T 1 . T T . .`\n    Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    So (3,4) is `T` (My body).\n    (5,4) is `.`.\n    (4,3) is at Row 3, Col 4.\n    Row 3: `T T T A . . T T . .`\n    Indices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    So (4,3) is `A`. Wait, the apple is at (3,3). (4,3) is also an apple? No, apples are at (3,3), (4,1), (2,2).\n    Let's check the list: Apples at (9,9), (2,2), (3,3), (4,1), (0,0).\n    So (4,3) is NOT an apple.\n    The map shows `T T T A . .` at row 3.\n    The `A` is at index 3, which is (3,3).\n    Index 4 is `.`, so (4,3) is empty.\n    So moving DOWN to (4,3) is safe (empty) and leads to the target (3,3).\n    Is there any risk?\n    Snake #0 is at (7,8).\n    It might move Left to (6,8).\n    It is very far.\n    So DOWN seems safe and optimal.\n    \n    Let's check UP just in case. (4,5). Row 5: `T . . . . . T T . .` (indices 0-9). (4,5) is `.`.\n    Up is safe.\n    Left is `T` (Self).\n    Right is `.` (Safe).\n    So UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n    Target is (3,3).\n    Distance to (3,3):\n    From (4,4): |4-3|+|4-3| = 2.\n    From (4,5): |4-3|+|5-3| = 3.\n    From (5,4): |5-3|+|4-3| = 3.\n    From (4,3): |4-3|+|3-3| = 1.\n    So DOWN gets me adjacent to the apple (actually on the x-axis of it, one step away).\n    If I move DOWN to (4,3), next turn I can move LEFT to (3,3) to eat it.\n    So DOWN is the best move.\n\n    Wait, check the enemy snake again.\n    Snake #0 ends at (4,7).\n    If I move DOWN to (4,3), I am creating a vertical line from (4,3) to (4,7) with a gap at (4,6) and (4,5).\n    If Snake #0 moves Left to (6,8) and then eventually Down, it might approach.\n    But right now, DOWN is clear.\n    One concern: Is there a trap?\n    If I go DOWN to (4,3), then LEFT to (3,3) to eat the apple.\n    At (3,3), I am safe.\n    Then I can go DOWN to (3,2) or LEFT to (2,3) or UP to (3,4).\n    (3,4) is my body, so I can't go UP.\n    (2,3) is my body? My body is (2,4) -> (2,3).\n    So (2,3) is occupied.\n    So if I eat at (3,3), I am at (3,3) with body occupying (4,3), (2,4), (2,3).\n    I am blocked by my own body at (2,3) and (4,3).\n    I can only go LEFT to (2,3) (Death) or RIGHT to (4,3) (Body) or DOWN to (3,2).\n    Wait, if I am at (3,3) and I just ate, my tail does not move this turn.\n    My body becomes: (3,3), (4,3), (3,4) ... wait.\n    My current body: (4,4) -> (3,4) -> (2,4) -> ...\n    Move Down to (4,3). New head (4,3). Body: (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4)...\n    Next turn move Left to (3,3). New head (3,3). Body: (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4)...\n    At (3,3), the cells around me:\n    (3,2): Row 2, Col 3 is `A` (Apple).\n    (2,3): My body (4,3)? No, (4,3) is the segment behind (3,3)? No, (4,3) is the previous head.\n    My body at (3,3) is:\n    1. (3,3) Head\n    2. (4,3) Old head\n    3. (4,4) Old head\n    4. (3,4)\n    5. (2,4) ...\n    So (3,2) is apple.\n    (2,3): Is this occupied? My body list: (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (2,3).\n    Yes, (2,3) is occupied by body.\n    (3,4): Occupied by body.\n    (4,3): Occupied by body.\n    So at (3,3), I am trapped except for (3,2).\n    Is (3,2) safe?\n    Row 2: `. . A . . . T T . .`\n    Col 3 is `A` (Apple).\n    So (3,2) is an apple.\n    Is it safe from enemy?\n    Snake #0 is at (7,8).\n    So (3,2) is safe.\n    So eating (3,3) leads to (3,2).\n    Then (3,1) is `.` (Row 1: `... . A . T T`, col 3 is `.`).\n    So the path is valid.\n    \n    So DOWN is the correct move.\n    One final check: The gap at (5,4).\n    The map shows `1 . T T` at row 4.\n    (5,4) is empty.\n    (6,4) is `T` (Enemy body, column 6).\n    If I move RIGHT to (5,4), I am next to the enemy body column.\n    If I move DOWN to (4,3), I am moving towards the apple cluster.\n    DOWN is safer and better.\n\n    Wait, I should check if (4,3) is occupied by *anything*.\n    Row 3: `T T T A . .`\n    (4,3) is the 4th item (0-indexed).\n    0: T\n    1: T\n    2: T\n    3: A (3,3)\n    4: . (4,3)\n    So it is empty.\n    \n    Is there any risk of Snake #0 moving to (4,3)?\n    Snake #0 is at (7,8). Distance to (4,3) is |7-4|+|8-3| = 3+5 = 8. He cannot reach it in 1 turn.\n    So DOWN is safe.\n\n    Final decision: DOWN.\n    \n    Wait, let's check if (4,3) is blocked by the apple at (3,3)? No, they are adjacent.\n    \n    What about the fact that (3,3) is an apple?\n    If I move DOWN to (4,3), I am one step away.\n    If I move RIGHT to (5,4), I am farther.\n    If I move UP to (4,5), I am farther.\n    So DOWN is the move.\n\n    Wait, looking at the board again.\n    Row 4: `T . T T 1 . T T . .`\n    Row 4 index 0 is T, 1 is ., 2 is T, 3 is T, 4 is 1.\n    Wait, the map legend:\n    0: Snake #0\n    1: Me\n    T: Body\n    A: Apple\n    .: Empty\n    \n    The string `T . T T 1 . T T . .`\n    Index 0: T (Body)\n    Index 1: . (Empty)\n    Index 2: T (Body)\n    Index 3: T (Body)\n    Index 4: 1 (Me)\n    Index 5: . (Empty)\n    Index 6: T (Body)\n    ...\n    \n    My body is at (3,4).\n    So (3,4) is T.\n    (2,4) is T.\n    (1,4) is . (Empty).\n    (0,4) is T.\n    \n    So the body at index 0 (x=0) is (0,4).\n    The body at index 2 (x=2) is (2,4).\n    The body at index 3 (x=3) is (3,4).\n    \n    So (1,4) is empty. Is that safe?\n    Yes.\n    But (1,4) moves me further from the target (3,3).\n    \n    Target is (3,3).\n    Moves:\n    UP (4,5): Safe, empty. Distance to target 3.\n    DOWN (4,3): Safe, empty. Distance to target 1.\n    LEFT (3,4): Unsafe, my body.\n    RIGHT (5,4): Safe, empty. Distance to target 3.\n    \n    So DOWN is the only move that decreases distance to target.\n    Therefore, I choose DOWN.\n    \n    Wait, one check on Snake #0.\n    Snake #0 head is at (7,8).\n    Body is at (7,7)...\n    Gap at (8,8).\n    It might move Right to (8,8).\n    It is far away.\n    No collision risk.\n\n    So, the move is DOWN.\n    \n    Wait, I need to make sure (4,3) is not occupied by a body.\n    Map row 3: `T T T A . . T T . .`\n    (4,3) is index 4.\n    The string is `T T T A . . T T . .`\n    Indexes: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    So (4,3) is index 4, which is `.` (Empty).\n    Correct.\n    \n    So DOWN is safe.\n    \n    Wait, what if Snake #0 moves Down to (7,7)?\n    (7,7) is its own body (7,7) is in the body list.\n    So it dies.\n    It won't do that.\n    \n    What if it moves Left to (6,8)?\n    It controls (6,8).\n    It has body at (6,7)...\n    It is safe.\n    It doesn't affect me.\n    \n    So, DOWN.\n    \n    Wait, I should check if (4,3) is a trap.\n    If I go (4,4) -> (4,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1).\n    (3,1) is `.` (Row 1: `... . A . T T` -> (3,1) is index 3, which is `.`, then index 4 is `A`).\n    So (3,1) is safe.\n    (3,0) is `.`.\n    So I can escape downwards if needed.\n    \n    So the plan is solid.\n    Move DOWN.\n    \n    Wait, I must check if (3,3) is the closest apple.\n    Apples: (9,9), (2,2), (3,3), (4,1), (0,0).\n    From (4,4):\n    To (3,3): 2 steps.\n    To (4,1): 3 steps.\n    To (2,2): 4 steps.\n    To (0,0): 8 steps.\n    To (9,9): 10 steps.\n    Yes, (3,3) is the closest.\n    \n    So I must move towards (3,3).\n    The only way is DOWN then LEFT.\n    Or LEFT then DOWN? No, LEFT is blocked.\n    So DOWN is the only option to start the path.\n    \n    Wait, can I reach it by going UP-LEFT? No, LEFT is blocked.\n    Can I go RIGHT-DOWN-LEFT? Yes, but that's 3 steps. DOWN-LEFT is 2 steps.\n    So DOWN is better.\n    \n    Final check: Is there any reason NOT to go DOWN?\n    If I go DOWN, I enter (4,3).\n    Is (4,3) empty? Yes.\n    Is (4,3) on my body? No.\n    Is (4,3) on enemy body? No.\n    Will I be trapped? No, I have exit via (3,2) after eating (3,3).\n    \n    So, DOWN.\n    \n    Wait, I must write the plan for the next turn.\n    \"Move to (4,3) to get closer to apple at (3,3).\"\n    \"Move towards the apple at (3,3).\"\n    \n    I'll put the plan in the format requested.\n    The move is DOWN.\n    \n    Double check the coordinates.\n    Head: (4,4).\n    DOWN means y-1 -> (4,3).\n    Yes.\n    \n    I will output DOWN.\n    \n    Wait, I see the map has a T at (3,4) which is left of me.\n    And T at (2,4).\n    And T at (0,4).\n    So (1,4) is empty.\n    But I don't want to go to (1,4) because it moves me away from the apple.\n    \n    So, DOWN.\n    \n    One last check on the enemy.\n    Snake #0 is at (7,8).\n    The gap is at (8,8).\n    It might move Right.\n    If it moves Right, it dies (off board).\n    If it moves Left, it eats an apple? No.\n    If it moves Up, it hits the wall? (7,9) is valid.\n    If it moves Down, it hits body (7,7).\n    So it will likely move Left or Up.\n    It doesn't threaten me.\n    \n    So, the answer is DOWN.\n    \n    Wait, the prompt says \"Do not mention future directions after it.\"\n    So just \"DOWN\".\n    \n    I will include the plan in the thought block.\n    \n    Plan: Move towards the apple at (3,3) by stepping Down to (4,3).\n    \n    Wait, I should check if I am moving backwards.\n    My previous move was RIGHT (from 2,4 to 4,4? No, 2,4 to 3,4).\n    My body is (3,4), (2,4)...\n    If I move DOWN, I go to (4,3).\n    Is that backwards into my body? (3,4) is adjacent to (4,4). (4,3) is not (3,4).\n    So it's not backwards.\n    \n    Correct.\n    \n    Output: DOWN.**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nMove towards the apple at (3, 3) to score. After reaching (3, 3), I will navigate towards the cluster of apples at (7, 7), (7, 8), and (9, 9) to catch up to Snake #0.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\n**START RATIONALE**\n1.  **Current State**: My head is at (4, 4). My body immediately follows at (3, 4).\n2.  **Immediate Threats**: Moving **LEFT** to (3, 4) would be fatal as it collides with my own body. Moving **UP** or **RIGHT** are safe but move me away from the closest apple at (3, 3).\n3.  **Safe Moves**:\n    *   **DOWN** to (4, 3) is confirmed empty on the map and moves me directly towards the apple at (3, 3).\n    *   **UP** to (4, 5) is safe but increases distance to the target.\n    *   **RIGHT** to (5, 4) is safe but increases distance to the target.\n4.  **Strategic Choice**: The apple at (3, 3) is the closest target. To reach it, I must navigate around my own body at (3, 4). Moving **DOWN** to (4, 3) positions me perfectly to capture the apple on the next turn by moving **LEFT**. This path maximizes safety and score potential.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

This cell contains my own body segment (the start of the chain listed as `[(4, 3), ...]`). **This is a collision.**\n2.  **DOWN:** Target `(4, 1)`. This cell contains an Apple.\n    *   *Safety:* No snake body or wall is listed at `(4, 1)`. It is safe.\n    *   *Effect:* Eat apple -> Grow. The tail will not move this turn.\n    *   *Positioning:* Moves towards `(0, 0)` and `(4, 1)`.\n3.  **LEFT:** Target `(3, 2)`.\n    *   *Safety:* The map shows `.` (empty) at `(3, 2)`. It is safe.\n    *   *Positioning:* Moves towards apples `(2, 2)` (directly Left) and `(3, 3)` (Up-Left).\n4.  **RIGHT:** Target `(5, 2)`.\n    *   *Safety:* The map shows `.` (empty) at `(5, 2)`. It is safe.\n    *   *Positioning:* Moves away from all nearby apples.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nBoth **DOWN** and **LEFT** are valid safe moves.\n*   **DOWN** guarantees an immediate point by eating the apple at `(4, 1)`. This keeps the tail longer (temporarily safer) and clears the path for future movement.\n*   **LEFT** positions the head at `(3, 2)`, placing it adjacent to apples at `(2, 2)` and `(3, 3)`, offering high scoring potential next turn.\n\nGiven the need to maintain safety and the fact that the prompt explicitly requested a \"Strategy Note\" focusing on moving to the closest apple (which could be interpreted as either the immediate adjacent one or the cluster), choosing the move that guarantees survival and scores immediately is the optimal play. Moving **DOWN** consumes the apple at `(4, 1)`.\n\n**Strategy Note:**\nSecure the guaranteed point at `(4, 1)` to grow immediately. This avoids the potential trap of moving Left into `(3, 2)` where the body will eventually constrict movement. By eating the apple at `(4, 1)`, we maintain a safe buffer and can navigate towards the cluster at `(2, 2)` and `(3, 3)` on subsequent turns.\n\nDOWN",

No immediate threat to my current position.\n\n**Analysis of Moves:**\n\n1.  **UP:** Target (4, 2).\n    *   This is occupied by my own body segment `[(4, 2), ...]`.\n    *   **Result:** Collision -> Death.\n\n2.  **DOWN:** Target (4, 0).\n    *   Board map shows `.` (empty) at (4, 0).\n    *   Is this safe? Yes, for this turn.\n    *   Long-term safety? My body occupies (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4). If I go DOWN to (4, 0), I will be entering a \"cul-de-sac\" (dead end). To leave, I must turn, but my body will block the exit.\n    *   Example path: Head at (4, 0).\n        *   Next turn Move RIGHT to (5, 0) -> Safe.\n        *   Next turn Move UP to (5, 1) -> Safe.\n        *   Next turn Move LEFT to (4, 1) -> **DEAD**. (My tail will have moved from (4, 1), but since I didn't eat an apple this turn, the tail moves. However, the body at (4, 2) and (4, 3) blocks the turn UP). Actually, if I don't eat, the tail moves. But looking at the vertical wall of my body at (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), the space to turn UP from (5, 0) is limited.\n        *   Actually, if I go DOWN to (4, 0), I am effectively trapping myself in the bottom row against my own vertical body wall. I can only move Right or Left. Moving Left hits the wall. Moving Right leads to (5, 0), (6, 0) which is blocked by Enemy Snake #0's tail at (6, 0).\n        *   **Conclusion:** This is a Trap/Dead End. Avoid.\n\n3.  **LEFT:** Target (3, 1).\n    *   Map shows `.` (empty).\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   Strategic value? This moves me closer to apples at (2, 2) and (3, 3).\n    *   Follow-up options from (3, 1):\n        *   UP to (3, 2): Safe.\n        *   LEFT to (2, 1): Safe.\n        *   DOWN to (3, 0): Safe (Apple at (0,0) direction).\n        *   RIGHT to (4, 1): Safe (where I am now).\n    *   This path keeps options open and avoids the wall.\n\n4.  **RIGHT:** Target (5, 1).\n    *   Map shows `.` (empty).\n    *   Is it safe? Yes.\n    *   Strategic value? There is an apple at (5, 2).\n    *   Follow-up options from (5, 1):\n        *   UP to (5, 2): **Apple**. Safe.\n        *   LEFT to (4, 1): Safe.\n        *   DOWN to (5, 0): Safe.\n        *   RIGHT to (6, 1): **DANGER**. Snake #0 body occupies (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)...\n    *   If I go RIGHT -> UP, I eat the apple at (5, 2). My tail stays. My body fills in.\n    *   If I go RIGHT -> DOWN -> RIGHT -> ..., I hit the enemy wall at (6, 1).\n    *   However, I don't have to go RIGHT. From (5, 1), I can go UP to the apple.\n    *   This seems like the best path. Right to get in range of the apple, then Up to eat it.\n\n**Comparison:**\nLEFT allows movement toward the cluster at (2,2)/(3,3).\nRIGHT allows movement toward the specific apple at (5,2).\nRIGHT -> UP is a guaranteed apple eat in 2 turns (Turn 71: Right, Turn 72: Up). Assuming I survive the intermediate steps.\n\nWait, let's re-verify the \"Right -> Up\" safety.\nTurn 71: Move RIGHT to (5, 1).\nTurn 72: Move UP to (5, 2). Eat apple.\nWhere is my body? The tail moves.\nIs (5, 2) safe? My body is coming from (4, 1) -> (4, 2) -> ...\nThe enemy is far away (at 6,0 etc).\nIs there any other snake at (5, 2)? No.\nIs there a wall? No.\nIs there my own body? No, I am moving into empty space (assuming the tail moves).\n\nLet's check if I can get trapped by moving RIGHT.\nIf I go RIGHT to (5, 1). Then UP to (5, 2). Eat.\nThen next moves... I am at (5, 2). My body is behind me. I can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\nThis seems safe.\n\nLet's check if I can get trapped by moving LEFT.\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 1).\nThen I can go UP to (3, 2).\nThen I can go LEFT to (2, 2) and eat that apple.\nThis is also valid.\n\nWhy choose RIGHT over LEFT?\nThe apple at (5, 2) is just as close (1 move away if I step right, then up, effectively 2 moves to eat) as the apple at (2, 2) (1 move left, then up, effectively 2 moves to eat).\nHowever, moving RIGHT moves me *away* from my own body wall at (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4).\nMoving LEFT moves me *closer* to the corner of my own body.\nAlso, the apple at (5, 2) is isolated. The apples at (2, 2) and (3, 3) are close to each other. It might be better to save the cluster for later when I have more freedom, and grab the isolated apple now to grow.\n\nStrategy Note:\nAvoid the trap at (4, 0) by rejecting DOWN. Avoid suicide at (4, 2) by rejecting UP.\nChoose RIGHT to approach the isolated apple at (5, 2). This positions the head in open space away from the dense body cluster near the left wall. After moving Right, the next move Up will consume the apple safely.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Move RIGHT to (5, 1).\n2.  Next turn (if safe), move UP to (5, 2) to eat the apple.\n\n**Safety check for RIGHT:**\nTarget (5, 1) is empty.\nSnakes:\nMy body: (4, 1) [current head], (4, 2)...\nEnemy: (9, 9)... (6, 7).\nCollision? None.\nWall? No.\nBackwards? No (I am at (4, 1), moving to (5, 1)).\n\n**Safety check for UP (next turn potential):**\nTarget (5, 2).\nSnakes: Enemy at (6, 2)? No, Enemy at (6, 0)-(6, 7). Wait, Enemy body is at (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)...\nYes, Enemy body is at (6, 2).\nIs (5, 2) adjacent to (6, 2)? Yes.\nIs (5, 2) occupied by Enemy Body? No.\nIs (5, 2) occupied by My Body? No.\nSo (5, 2) is safe to move into.\n\nWait, checking Enemy #0 body again: `Body: [...(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)...]`\nSo (6, 2) is occupied.\nMy move to (5, 2) is safe.\n\nWait, is there an Apple at (5, 2)?\nApples listed: (2, 2), (3, 3), (0, 0), (7, 9), (5, 2).\nYes.\n\nSo RIGHT is the correct move to set up the apple eat.\n\nWait, looking at the board map provided:\n`2 . . A . T A T T . .`\nRow 2 (y=2):\n(0,2) .\n(1,2) .\n(2,2) A\n(3,2) .\n(4,2) T (My body at (4,2)? Yes)\n(5,2) A (Apple)\n(6,2) T (Enemy body at (6,2)? Yes)\n...\nSo the map confirms an apple at (5, 2).\nAnd confirms enemy body at (6, 2).\nMy body at (4, 2).\n\nSo (5, 2) is empty.\n\nWait, I need to check one more thing.\nTurn 71: I move Right to (5, 1).\nEnemy moves.\nIf Enemy #0 moves Left (towards me), could they reach (5, 1)? No, they are at (9,9).\nIf Enemy #0 moves Down, they go to (9, 8). Still far.\nThey are in the top right corner.\n\nSo RIGHT is safe.\n\nWait, is LEFT safer?\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 1).\nApple at (2, 2) and (3, 3).\nIf I go LEFT -> UP to (3, 2) -> LEFT to (2, 2). Eat.\nIf I go LEFT -> UP to (3, 2) -> UP to (3, 3). Eat.\nAlso good.\n\nWhy RIGHT?\nBecause (5, 1) -> (5, 2) eats an apple.\n(3, 1) -> (3, 2) eats nothing.\n(3, 1) -> (2, 1) eats nothing.\n(3, 1) -> (2, 2) eats an apple (requires 2 moves: Left then Up).\nSo the apple at (5, 2) is reachable in 2 moves (Right, Up).\nThe apple at (2, 2) is reachable in 2 moves (Left, Up).\nThe apple at (3, 3) is reachable in 2 moves (Left, Up).\n\nBoth are 2 moves.\nBut moving Right takes me away from the enemy (which is far anyway) and away from my body.\nMoving Left takes me towards the corner.\nLet's look at the corner (0,0). There is an apple there.\nMaybe I should go Left to start heading towards (0,0) and the cluster?\nHowever, (0,0) is 4 Left and 1 Down from (3, 1).\n(5,2) is 1 Right and 1 Up from (4, 1).\n\nLet's stick to the immediate apple.\nIf I go RIGHT, I can eat (5, 2) next turn.\nIf I go LEFT, I can eat (2, 2) in 2 turns, or (3, 3) in 2 turns.\nActually, if I go LEFT to (3, 1), I am adjacent to (2, 2) (Left 1, Up 1) and (3, 3) (Up 2).\nWait, (3, 1) to (3, 3) is UP, UP.\n(3, 1) to (2, 2) is LEFT, UP.\nSo from (3, 1), I can reach an apple in 1 turn?\nNo, apples are at (2, 2) and (3, 3).\n(3, 1) -> (3, 2) (empty).\n(3, 1) -> (2, 1) (empty).\nSo no apple in 1 turn.\n\nFrom (4, 1):\nRight to (5, 1) -> Up to (5, 2) (Apple).\nLeft to (3, 1) -> Up to (3, 2) -> Left to (2, 2) (Apple).\nLeft to (3, 1) -> Up to (3, 2) -> Up to (3, 3) (Apple).\n\nThe path to (5, 2) is clearer (2 moves).\nThe path to (2, 2) or (3, 3) is also 2-3 moves.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"Dead End\" argument for DOWN.\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 0), I am at the wall.\nI can go Right to (5, 0).\nThen Up to (5, 1).\nThen Left to (4, 1). BUT (4, 1) was my previous head. If I ate an apple, the tail doesn't move, so (4, 1) becomes body. If I didn't eat, the tail moves.\nIf I go DOWN, I don't eat.\nSo:\nTurn 71: Down to (4, 0).\nTurn 72: Right to (5, 0).\nTurn 73: Up to (5, 1).\nTurn 74: Left to (4, 1).\nOn Turn 74, is (4, 1) occupied?\nMy body history:\nT70: Head (4, 1). Body: (4, 2)...\nT71: Head (4, 0). Body: (4, 1), (4, 2)...\nT72: Head (5, 0). Body: (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)...\nT73: Head (5, 1). Body: (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)...\nT74: Head (4, 1). Body: (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1)...\nWait, on T74, I move Left from (5, 1) to (4, 1).\nMy body before moving is (5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2)...\nSo moving to (4, 1) hits my own body at (4, 1).\nYes, going DOWN leads to death in a few turns unless I eat an apple to extend the tail.\nAre there apples near (4, 0)? No. (0, 0) is far left.\nSo DOWN is definitely bad.\n\nSo, choices are LEFT or RIGHT.\nRIGHT -> (5, 1). Next move Up to eat (5, 2).\nLEFT -> (3, 1). Next move Left/Up to eat (2, 2) or (3, 3).\n\nLet's check if (5, 1) is safe relative to Enemy #0.\nEnemy #0 is at (9, 9) -> ... -> (6, 7).\nDistance is huge. They are not a threat.\nMy own body is not a threat if I move Right.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer LEFT?\nMaybe to keep the board open?\nMy body is a vertical line at x=4 from y=1 to y=4.\nMoving Left puts me at x=3.\nMoving Right puts me at x=5.\nThe board is 10x10. Both are open.\n\nMaybe I should look at the total game state.\nSnake 0: 19 apples.\nSnake 1 (Me): 14 apples.\nTurn 71/150.\nI need to catch up.\nEating an apple now is crucial.\n\nWhich apple is safer?\n(5, 2) is surrounded by empty space on the map (except for the enemy wall at 6,2).\n(2, 2) is near my own body at (4, 2).\n(3, 3) is near my body at (4, 3).\nThe \"Open space\" near (5, 2) is better.\n\nLet's double check the Enemy #0 body at (6, 2).\nIf I am at (5, 2), the enemy is at (6, 2).\nIf I am at (5, 2), can I move Right? No, (6, 2) is enemy body.\nCan I move Up? Yes, (5, 3) is empty (map shows `.` at (5, 3) in row 3? No, row 3 is `T T T A T ...` at x=3..6. Wait. Row 3: `3 T T T A T . T T . .`\n(5, 3) is `T`. Is that my body or enemy?\nMy body: (4, 3), (4, 4), (3, 4)...\nEnemy: (6, 3)...\n(5, 3) is `T` on the map.\nWho is at (5, 3)?\nMy body: No.\nEnemy #0: (6, 3), (6, 4)... No (6, 3) is enemy, but (5, 3) is neighbor.\nWait, let's look at the map again.\nRow 3 (y=3): `T T T A T . T T . .`\nIndices:\n0: T\n1: T\n2: T\n3: A\n4: T\n5: .\n6: T\n7: T\n...\nSo (5, 3) is `.` (Empty).\nWait, my eyes tricked me. \"5: .\"\nYes, (5, 3) is empty.\nSo from (5, 2), I can go Up to (5, 3) if needed.\n\nLet's check the path to (2, 2).\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 1).\nThen UP to (3, 2).\nThen LEFT to (2, 2). Eat.\nThen I am at (2, 2).\nWhat are my options?\nLeft to (1, 2). Empty.\nDown to (2, 1). Empty.\nRight to (3, 2). My previous head.\nUp to (2, 3).\nMap row 3: (2, 3) is `T`.\nIs that my body? Yes, my body is at (2, 3).\nSo from (2, 2) after eating, I can go Left or Down.\nDown is (0, 0) direction.\nLeft is (0, 0) direction.\nThat seems okay too.\n\nLet's compare the \"score potential\".\nIf I go RIGHT -> (5, 1) -> (5, 2) [Eat].\nI have 15 apples.\nIf I go LEFT -> (3, 1) -> (3, 2) -> (2, 2) [Eat].\nI have 15 apples.\nThe time to eat is the same (2 turns).\n\nIs there any immediate danger?\nNo.\n\nWhy did I consider DOWN? Because the prompt said \"Move to closest apple\".\nClosest apple is (4, 1). Which I am standing on?\nWait.\nMy head is at (4, 1).\nApples listed: (2, 2), (3, 3), (0, 0), (7, 9), (5, 2).\nThere is no apple at (4, 1).\nWait. My head is at (4, 1).\nIs there an apple at (4, 1)?\nThe board row 1: `. . . . 1 . T T . .`\n(4, 1) is `1`.\nThe apple list does NOT include (4, 1).\nSo I am NOT standing on an apple.\nThe \"Last Rationale\" in the prompt was talking about an *old* state where the head was at (4, 2) and there was an apple at (4, 1).\nIn the *current* state:\nHead: (4, 1)\nApples: ... (5, 2) ...\nSo (4, 1) is empty (except for my head).\nThe apple at (5, 2) is the closest.\nDistance to (5, 2): |4-5| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2.\nDistance to (2, 2): |4-2| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3.\nDistance to (3, 3): |4-3| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3.\nDistance to (0, 0): |4-0| + |1-0| = 5.\nDistance to (7, 9): 3 + 8 = 11.\n\nSo (5, 2) is the closest apple.\nThe strategy \"move to closest apple\" leads me to (5, 2).\nTo get to (5, 2), I should move RIGHT (getting closer) or UP (getting closer).\nIf I move UP to (4, 2), I hit my body. Dead.\nSo I must move RIGHT to (5, 1).\nFrom (5, 1), distance to (5, 2) is 1.\n\nThis confirms RIGHT is the best move.\n\nStrategy Note:\nCurrent head is at (4, 1). The closest apple is at (5, 2), distance 2. Moving UP is fatal (hits own body at (4, 2)). Moving DOWN leads to a dead end. Moving LEFT moves towards apples at (2, 2) and (3, 3), but RIGHT moves directly towards the closest apple at (5, 2). Moving RIGHT to (5, 1) sets up a safe apple consumption next turn at (5, 2). This maintains the plan to secure immediate points.\n\nFinal check:\nTarget (5, 1) for my head.\nIs it empty? Map row 1: `. . . . 1 . T T . .`\n(4, 1) is 1 (Me).\n(5, 1) is `.`.\n(6, 1) is `T` (Enemy #0 body).\nSo (5, 1) is safe.\nIs it a wall? No (x=5 is within 0-9).\nIs it my body? No.\nIs it enemy body? No (Enemy is at 6,1, 7,1...).\n\nMove RIGHT.\n\nStrategy Note: My head is at (4, 1). The closest apple is at (5, 2). Moving UP is fatal (hits my body). Moving DOWN traps me against the wall. Moving LEFT is a valid alternative, but RIGHT moves directly towards the closest apple. I will move RIGHT to (5, 1) to position myself to eat the apple at (5, 2) on the next turn.\n\nRIGHT",
