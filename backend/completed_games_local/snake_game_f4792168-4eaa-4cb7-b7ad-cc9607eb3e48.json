          "rationale": "Current Situation:\n- My head is at (6, 8).\n- Enemy #1 is at (5, 4).\n- Apples are at (8, 2), (5, 0), (1, 0), (7, 8), (0, 0).\n- I have no body segments.\n- The board is empty aside from these positions.\n\nAnalysis of Moves:\n1.  **UP (6, 9):** Safe. Moves me towards the apple at (7, 8) (distance increases to sqrt(2), but keeps me on the same row as the target x). It is safe and maintains a path to the apple.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 7):** Safe. Moves me closer to the apple at (7, 8). This is a strong candidate as it reduces the Euclidean distance to the nearest apple and keeps the path open.\n3.  **LEFT (5, 8):** Safe. Moves me horizontally towards the apple at (7, 8) (reducing x distance). However, this moves me directly away from the top wall and closer to the center row where the enemy is. It also brings me to the same column as the enemy (x=5).\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 8):** Target! The apple is at (7, 8). Moving here consumes the apple, grows my snake, and scores a point.\n\nComparison of Options:\n- Moving **RIGHT** immediately puts me at (7, 8) and eats the apple. Since I have no body, I don't need to worry about immediate collision with my own tail.\n- Moving **DOWN** puts me at (6, 7). From there, I could eat the apple next turn by moving RIGHT. However, moving DOWN opens up the possibility of moving LEFT next to (5, 7). The enemy is at (5, 4). If the enemy moves UP to (5, 5) or further, and I move LEFT to (5, 7), I am moving closer to a potential collision zone (x=5 column). The vertical separation is 3 spaces (y=4 vs y=7).\n- Moving **LEFT** puts me at (5, 8). This is a dangerous column (x=5) where the enemy is currently located. While safe now, it limits future options compared to staying on the path to the apple.\n- Moving **UP** puts me at (6, 9). While safe, it moves me to the top edge, which can be restrictive (fewer escape routes). The apple is at (7, 8). From (6, 9), I would need to move DOWN or RIGHT to reach it. From (6, 8), moving RIGHT reaches it immediately.\n\nStrategy:\nThe primary objective is to score apples while maintaining safety.\nThe apple at (7, 8) is adjacent to my current head at (6, 8).\nTaking the immediate apple is usually the best play if it doesn't put me in immediate danger for the next turn.\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 8):\n- I eat the apple. My new head will be (7, 8), and I will grow.\n- My body will temporarily be just (6, 8) after the move (until I move again or the turn ends).\n- Next turn, I will be at (7, 8) with a tail at (6, 8). I will have open paths to (8, 8), (7, 9), (7, 7), or (8, 9).\n- The enemy snake is far away at (5, 4). It cannot reach me in one turn. Even if it moves optimally towards me (which it likely won't, it will chase apples), it is safe.\n\nLong-term plan:\n1. Move RIGHT to (7, 8) to eat the apple and grow.\n2. From (7, 8), evaluate the next closest apple. Likely (8, 2) or (5, 0).\n3. Avoid the x=5 column where the enemy is currently hovering to minimize collision risk.\n\nLet's verify the \"immediate collision threat\" from the prompt's previous thought. The prompt said: \"Enemy snake #1 is at (5,5)\". Wait, looking at the board state: \"4 . . . . . 1 . . . .\" (Wait, the board state says `4 . . . . . 1 . . . .` but the description says `Enemy snakes: * Snake #1 - Head: (5, 4)`. There is a discrepancy. The board shows `1` at (5, 4) if the row index 4 corresponds to y=4. Let's re-read the board.\n`9 . . . . . . . . . .`\n...\n`4 . . . . . 1 . . . .`\nThe prompt text description says: `Enemy snakes: * Snake #1 - Head: (5, 4), Body: none`. The board visualization shows `1` on the row labeled `4`. Row 4 corresponds to y=4. So the enemy is at (5, 4). The previous rationale said \"Enemy snake #1 is at (5,5)\". That was an error in the previous turn's thought process or a misinterpretation of the board. The actual enemy position is (5, 4).\nDistance from Me (6, 8) to Enemy (5, 4) is `|6-5| + |8-4| = 1 + 4 = 5`. This is a safe distance.\nThe previous rationale claimed \"There is an immediate collision threat.\" This was incorrect. The enemy is at y=4, I am at y=8. We are 4 rows apart.\nTherefore, the constraint \"If we both move toward each other, we will collide\" is not a direct threat right now.\nThis frees me up to take the apple safely without worrying about the enemy.\n\nDecision:\nI will move **RIGHT** to (7, 8) to eat the apple.\n\nSelf-Correction on Rationale:\nThe previous turn's rationale mentioned an immediate collision threat at (5,5) vs (5,8). The board shows the enemy at (5,4). The distance is 4 rows. It is safe to take the apple.\nHowever, I must write the *new* rationale for *my* move. I should not just say \"previous rationale was wrong\". I should state the correct state.\nCorrect state: Enemy is at (5, 4). I am at (6, 8). Distance is 4 vertical + 1 horizontal = 5. This is safe.\nApple is at (7, 8). Moving RIGHT eats it.\n\nI will write a short plan explaining the move to the apple and noting the safe distance from the enemy.\n\nPlan:\nMove RIGHT to (7, 8) to eat the apple. The enemy at (5, 4) is 4 rows away and poses no immediate threat. Eating the apple grows my snake, giving me a score lead and size advantage.\n\nMove:\nRIGHT\n\nWait, I should double check the board dimensions and coordinate system.\n\"Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\nBoard:\nRow 9 is top.\nRow 0 is bottom.\nSo (6, 8) is indeed the head.\nEnemy at (5, 4) is 4 rows below (y=4 vs y=8).\nCorrect.\n\nOne more check: \"If you move into your own body... you die.\"\nI have no body. So moving backwards isn't possible.\n\"If you move onto an apple, you grow.\"\nI am moving onto (7, 8), which contains an apple.\n\"Simultaneous movement\".\nEnemy moves same time I do. Enemy cannot reach me.\n\nFinal check of all options relative to Apple:\n1. RIGHT -> (7, 8) -> Apple eaten. New head (7, 8). Tail (6, 8). Safe.\n2. DOWN -> (6, 7) -> No apple. Safe. Next turn to (7, 8) or (6, 8).\n3. LEFT -> (5, 8) -> No apple. Safe. Moves closer to enemy column.\n4. UP -> (6, 9) -> No apple. Safe.\n\nRIGHT is the only immediate scoring move. It is safe. It is the best move.\n\nShort plan: Eat the apple at (7,8) to score. The enemy is far away.\n\nFinal move word: RIGHT\n\nOne detail: The prompt asks for \"a short long-term plan or strategy note\". I should include that in my thought process before the final word.\n\"Move RIGHT to eat the apple at (7,8). This scores a point and grows the snake. The enemy is currently at (5,4) which is safely distant (4 units away). After eating, I will have a tail at (6,8) and open space to maneuver towards the next closest apple.\"\n\nFinal Output Format:\nRationale (Thought)\nPlan (Thought)\nFinal Word\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nAnd \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\nSo I can output:\n[Talk/Rationale/Plan]\nRIGHT\n\nI will combine the rationale and plan.\n\"Enemy is at (5, 4) which is 4 rows below (my y=8). This is a safe distance.\nI can move RIGHT to (7, 8) to eat the apple immediately. This is the optimal play to score points and grow my snake.\nLong-term: Eat (7,8), then head towards (8,2) or (5,0).\"\n\nWait, I should check if the enemy can collide with me if I go to (7,8).\nIf enemy moves UP to (5,5), I am at (7,8).\nDistance is 2 rows, 2 cols. Safe.\nIf enemy moves UP to (5,8), distance is 2 cols. Safe.\nIf enemy moves UP to (5,9), distance is 1 row, 2 cols. Safe.\nIt is impossible for the enemy to reach me in one turn.\n\nThe move is correct.\n\nOne final check on \"HEAD-ON COLLISION\".\n\"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die\".\nMy target is (7,8). Is it possible for the enemy to move to (7,8)?\nEnemy is at (5,4).\nMoves to (6,4), (5,5), (4,4), (5,3).\nNo. Cannot reach (7,8).\nSo no head-on collision.\n\nCorrect.\n\nOne check on \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies\".\nIf I move to (7,8), my body is effectively empty for this turn (since I have no body currently). Or rather, the tail is not yet moved. Since I have no body, the enemy cannot run into my body.\n\nEverything checks out.\n\nI will write the output.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\nI will put the plan/rationale in the preceding text, and \"RIGHT\" on its own line.\n\nOne small nuance: The prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo I should write a specific plan.\nPlan: \"Eat apple at (7,8). Prepare to move towards (8,2) or (5,0) depending on enemy movement next turn.\"\n\nLet's keep it simple and focused.\n\nCurrent position (6,8). Apple at (7,8).\nEnemy at (5,4).\nMove RIGHT.\n\nReasoning:\n1. Immediate score.\n2. Safe from collision (distance > 1).\n3. Safe from wall.\n4. Grows snake.\n\nThis is a standard \"greedy\" move but verified safe.\n\nFinal check on previous turn's \"threat\".\nPrevious rationale claimed: \"There is an immediate collision threat. Enemy snake #1 is at (5,5)...\".\nBoard state: \"4 . . . . . 1 . . . .\".\nRow 4 is y=4.\nSo Enemy is at y=4.\nMy head is at (6,8) -> y=8.\nDifference is 4.\nPrevious rationale was wrong about the enemy position (5,5) and the threat level.\nHowever, I am starting a new turn.\nMy rationale should be based on the CURRENT state.\nCurrent state: Enemy at (5,4). Safe.\n\nI will output the plan and the move.\n\nOne constraint: \"Do not mention future directions after it.\" (The final word).\nSo the final word must be \"RIGHT\" and nothing else.\n\nThe plan is for \"future self\", so it's okay to mention future directions *before* the final word.\n\"Prepare to move towards (8,2)...\" seems okay.\n\nLet's refine the output.\n\nRationale:\n- Eat apple at (7,8) immediately.\n- Enemy at (5,4) is 4 units away, no collision threat.\n- Growing snake is priority.\n\nPlan:\n- Head to (7,8) now.\n- Next turn, evaluate (8,2) vs (5,0). (8,2) is at x=8, y=2. (5,0) is at x=5, y=0.\n- From (7,8), (8,2) is closer (distance 6 vs 10).\n- Avoid the x=5 column if enemy stays there.\n\nFinal word: RIGHT\n\nDouble check board size: 10x10. Indices 0-9.\n(7,8) is valid.\n(6,8) is valid.\n(5,4) is valid.\n\nOkay.\n\nOne thought: What if the enemy moves UP and I move RIGHT?\nEnemy at (5,5), Me at (7,8).\nSafe.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves RIGHT and I move RIGHT?\nEnemy at (6,4), Me at (7,8).\nSafe.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves UP and I move RIGHT?\nMe at (7,8), Enemy at (5,5).\nSafe.\n\nIt's all good.\n\nI will generate the response now.\n\nOne detail: \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\"\n\"Among remaining safe moves, favor moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available and move you closer to reachable apples...\"\nMoving RIGHT takes an apple.\nMoving DOWN moves closer but doesn't take it.\nMoving LEFT moves closer but doesn't take it.\nMoving UP moves away (closest apple is (7,8) at distance 1, (0,0) at distance 15. (7,8) is closer. Moving UP puts me at (6,9). Distance to (7,8) becomes sqrt(1^2+1^2)=1.41. Distance to (5,0) increases. So UP is strictly worse than RIGHT for the (7,8) apple.\n\nDecision is confirmed.\n\nI'll write the response.Current situation: I am at (6, 8) and there is an apple at (7, 8). Enemy #1 is at (5, 4), which is 4 units away vertically. There is no immediate threat of collision. Moving RIGHT will allow me to eat the apple immediately, scoring a point and growing my snake. This is the most efficient move. Moving any other direction would delay scoring and move me away from the closest apple.\n\nPlan: Eat the apple at (7, 8). After growing, evaluate the nearest remaining apples (likely (8, 2) or (5, 0)) while maintaining distance from the enemy.\n\nRIGHT",

I previously moved right from (7, 8) to (8, 8) to avoid a potential head-on collision with Snake #1 who was at (5, 2) and potentially moving right. Checking the board state from the turn summary: Snake #1 is now at (5, 2) (Head) with no body. This suggests Snake #1 moved from (5, 4) to (5, 2), likely eating the apple at (5, 0) or (5, 2)? Wait, the board state shows \"2 . . . . . 1 . . A .\" where '1' is at column 5, row 2. The apples list includes (5, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (9, 5), (8, 2). The apple at (5, 0) is present. Snake #1 moved from (5, 4) to (5, 2) (DOWN twice) or jumped? Wait, the turn is Turn 3. The previous turn was Turn 2. The last move info says \"My last move information: RIGHT\". And \"Current situation: I am at (6, 8) and there is an apple at (7, 8)\". This implies the turn 2 state had me at (6, 8). The turn 3 state has me at (8, 8). So I moved RIGHT twice? No, the \"last move\" was RIGHT from (6, 8) to (7, 8). But the current state says \"Head: (8, 8)\". There is a discrepancy between the textual description of the \"last move\" context and the provided board state. The board state is the authoritative source for the *current* turn. The board state shows:\nMy head: (8, 8)\nMy body: [(7, 8)]\nSnake #1 head: (5, 2)\n\nI am currently at (8, 8). I need to move.\nPossible moves:\n- UP: (8, 9). Valid.\n- DOWN: (8, 7). Valid.\n- LEFT: (7, 8). This is my current body segment. Moving LEFT would put my head into my own body (the segment at (7, 8)). This is suicide. **Eliminated**.\n- RIGHT: (9, 8). Valid.\n\nApples:\n(8, 2) - 6 steps away.\n(5, 0) - Eaten? No, board shows A at (5, 0) in row 0. Snake #1 is at (5, 2). So (5, 0) is still there.\n(1, 0), (0, 0), (9, 5).\n\nSnake #1 is at (5, 2). It is close to the cluster of apples at the bottom left. I am far right.\n\nI should move towards the nearest apple. The nearest apples are (9, 5) (Manhattan distance 4) and (8, 2) (Manhattan distance 6).\n(9, 5) is closer.\nPath to (9, 5):\nIf I go UP to (8, 9), dist to (9, 5) is 1+4=5.\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 7), dist to (9, 5) is 1+2=3. This is better.\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 8), dist to (9, 5) is 0+3=3. This is also good.\n\nHowever, consider Snake #1. It is at (5, 2). It likely wants the apples at (1, 0) or (5, 0). I am safe to pursue (9, 5).\nIf I go DOWN, I go to (8, 7). From there, I can go to (8, 6)... (8, 5) then right to (9, 5).\nIf I go RIGHT, I go to (9, 8). From there, I can go DOWN to (9, 7)... (9, 5).\nBoth are good.\n\nWait, looking at the \"Last Move Rationale\", it says: \"Current situation: I am at (6, 8) and there is an apple at (7, 8)\". And \"Moving RIGHT will allow me to eat the apple immediately\". This implies the apple was at (7, 8). But the current board state shows no apple at (7, 8). The apples are at (8,2), (5,0), (1,0), (0,0), (9,5).\nSo the apple was eaten? Or the rationale was from a previous hypothetical turn?\nIf I ate the apple at (7, 8), I should have grown. My body is currently [(7, 8)]. That fits.\nIf I didn't eat, I wouldn't have grown.\nSo I ate the apple.\n\nNow I am at (8, 8).\nI need to move.\nAvoid (7, 8).\nOptions: (8, 9), (8, 7), (9, 8).\n\nSnake #1 is at (5, 2).\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 7), I am getting closer to (9, 5).\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 8), I am getting closer to (9, 5).\n\nIs there any threat?\nMy body is at (7, 8).\nSnake #1 is far.\nNo immediate threats.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (9, 5). It is the closest high-value target? (8, 2) is further.\nI should aim for (9, 5).\n\nIf I move DOWN:\n(8, 7). Next turn I can move DOWN to (8, 6) -> (8, 5) -> (9, 5).\nIf I move RIGHT:\n(9, 8). Next turn I can move DOWN to (9, 7) -> (9, 6) -> (9, 5).\n\nLet's check if (9, 8) is a safe spot.\nBoard boundary: Yes.\nMy body: (8, 8) (current head) and (7, 8).\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 8), my new body will be [(9, 8), (8, 8)].\nThis is safe.\n\nLet's check if (8, 7) is a safe spot.\nMy body becomes [(8, 7), (8, 8)].\nSafe.\n\nBoth are good.\nHowever, moving RIGHT puts me at x=9. The apple is at (9, 5). Moving DOWN puts me at x=8.\nMoving RIGHT minimizes the distance to (9, 5) (Manhattan distance 3) vs moving DOWN (Manhattan distance 3). Tie.\nBut moving RIGHT might cut off the path if I need to go left later.\nMoving DOWN allows more flexibility (can go left or right).\nBut the apple is at (9, 5). Staying on the right wall is efficient for that apple.\n\nActually, looking at the board, there are no other apples near (9, 5).\nThe other apples are all bottom-left.\nIf I go for (9, 5), I will have to travel back across the board for the others.\nMaybe I should ignore (9, 5) for now and head towards the cluster (8, 2), (5, 0), etc?\nDistance to (8, 2) from (8, 8) is 6.\nDistance to (5, 0) from (8, 8) is 3+8=11.\nDistance to (9, 5) from (8, 8) is 1+3=4.\n(9, 5) is closest.\n\nWait, (8, 2) is at (8, 2).\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 7), I am on the path to (8, 2).\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 8), I am moving away from (8, 2).\n\nLet's reconsider the target.\nIf I go DOWN, I am on the path to both (8, 2) and (9, 5).\nPath to (8, 2): DOWN to (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2).\nPath to (9, 5): DOWN to (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (9, 5).\nSo DOWN is a \"hub\" for both.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I am on the path to (9, 5) only.\nPath to (9, 5): (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5).\nPath to (8, 2): (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4)... no, that's wrong. To get to (8, 2) from (9, 8), I have to go LEFT eventually.\nGoing RIGHT delays the turn back to the left.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN seems more flexible.\nHowever, let's check the \"Last Move Rationale\".\nIt mentioned: \"Plan: Eat the apple at (7, 8). After growing, evaluate the nearest remaining apples (likely (8, 2) or (5, 0))\".\nIt says (8, 2) or (5, 0).\nSo the plan is to target the bottom left cluster.\n(8, 2) is very close to my current column (8).\n(9, 5) is further away and isolated.\n\nIf I move DOWN, I am one step closer to (8, 2).\nIf I move RIGHT, I am moving away from (8, 2).\nBut I can't move LEFT (blocked by body).\nSo DOWN is the only option to move towards (8, 2).\nWait, can I move UP? (8, 9).\nThat moves me away from everything.\nSo DOWN is best for the (8, 2) target.\n\nLet's verify safety of DOWN to (8, 7).\nMy body: (7, 8).\nSnake #1: (5, 2).\nNo conflict.\n\nIs there a risk of Snake #1 intercepting me?\nSnake #1 is at (5, 2). If it moves UP to (5, 3)... it won't reach me.\nIf it moves RIGHT... it won't reach me.\nI am safe.\n\nSo the plan:\n1. Move DOWN to (8, 7).\n2. Next turn, move DOWN to (8, 6).\n3. Next turn, move DOWN to (8, 5).\n4. Next turn, move DOWN to (8, 4).\n5. Next turn, move DOWN to (8, 3).\n6. Next turn, move DOWN to (8, 2) - Eat apple.\n\nThis is 6 turns to get the (8, 2) apple.\nDistance to (9, 5) is 4 turns.\nDistance to (5, 0) is much more.\nSo (9, 5) is closer.\nWhy did the previous plan suggest (8, 2) or (5, 0)? Maybe because (9, 5) wasn't considered or the snake was further left?\nMy current head is (8, 8). (9, 5) is very close.\nLet's check the board again.\nApples at: (8, 2), (5, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0), (9, 5).\n(9, 5) is at x=9, y=5.\nI am at x=8, y=8.\nManhattan distance: |8-9| + |8-5| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n(8, 2) is at x=8, y=2.\nManhattan distance: |8-8| + |8-2| = 0 + 6 = 6.\n(5, 0) is at x=5, y=0.\nManhattan distance: |8-5| + |8-0| = 3 + 8 = 11.\n(9, 5) is definitely the closest.\n\nIf I move DOWN, I go to (8, 7). Distance to (9, 5) becomes 1+2=3.\nIf I move RIGHT, I go to (9, 8). Distance to (9, 5) becomes 0+3=3.\nIf I move UP, I go to (8, 9). Distance to (9, 5) becomes 1+4=5.\nIf I move LEFT, I die.\n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT are equally close to (9, 5).\nHowever, RIGHT puts me on the wall.\nDOWN puts me one step closer to (8, 2) as well (distance reduces from 6 to 5).\nSo DOWN is slightly better because it maintains flexibility towards the (8, 2) apple while not sacrificing distance to (9, 5).\n\nWait, if I move DOWN, the distance to (9, 5) is 3.\nIf I move RIGHT, the distance to (9, 5) is 3.\nIf I move DOWN, I can reach (9, 5) in 4 turns: (8,7) -> (8,6) -> (8,5) -> (9,5). That's 3 moves? (8,7) to (8,6) to (8,5) to (9,5) is 3 moves. Total 4 turns including this one.\nIf I move RIGHT, I can reach (9, 5) in 4 turns: (9,8) -> (9,7) -> (9,6) -> (9,5). That's 3 moves. Total 4 turns.\n\nSo it's a tie on the path to (9, 5).\nBut moving DOWN keeps me in the center column, allowing me to pivot to the left apples (5,0), (1,0), (0,0) if necessary.\nMoving RIGHT puts me on the edge.\nSo DOWN is better for future options.\n\nOne thing to check: Snake #1 at (5, 2).\nIf Snake #1 moves UP, it might block the path to the bottom apples.\nIf Snake #1 moves LEFT, it might eat (1, 0) or (0, 0).\nIt's far away from me.\nI don't need to worry about it for this move.\n\nDecision: Move DOWN.\nIt is safe and flexible.\n\nCheck \"Last Move Rationale\" again.\nIt said \"Moving RIGHT will allow me to eat the apple immediately\".\nThis confirms I was at (6, 8) and the apple was at (7, 8).\nI moved RIGHT to (7, 8).\nThen the board says I am at (8, 8) with body [(7, 8)].\nWait, if I was at (6, 8) and moved RIGHT to (7, 8), I should be at (7, 8) with body [(6, 8)].\nThere is a contradiction in the provided text vs the board state.\nBoard State: Head (8, 8), Body [(7, 8)].\n\"Last Move Info\": \"My last move information: RIGHT\".\n\"Current situation: I am at (6, 8) and there is an apple at (7, 8)\".\n\nPossibilities:\n1. The \"Current situation\" text is from a *previous* turn's rationale, not the actual current state of the snake on the board, but describes the *reason* for the last move. However, the board state is the absolute current state.\n2. The board state is correct.\n3. If the board state is correct, I am at (8, 8).\n4. The \"Last Move\" being RIGHT implies I moved from (7, 8) to (8, 8).\n5. This fits the board state perfectly.\n6. So the \"Current situation: I am at (6, 8)\" text in the provided input is likely a typo or a copy-paste error from a previous turn's context that I shouldn't rely on for my *current* position, only for the *intent* of the last move.\n7. I must trust the board state: Head (8, 8), Body [(7, 8)].\n\nGiven Head (8, 8), Body [(7, 8)]:\nMy previous position was (7, 8).\nI moved RIGHT to (8, 8).\nThe apple at (7, 8) is now the segment of my tail.\nI have collected the apple.\n\nNow I am at (8, 8).\nI need to move.\nLeft is blocked by body (7, 8).\nRight is (9, 8).\nUp is (8, 9).\nDown is (8, 7).\n\nTarget: (9, 5) is closest.\nMoving DOWN is flexible.\nMoving RIGHT is safe.\n\nLet's consider the \"Dead end\" rule.\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 8), I am on the wall. The only way to move is UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\nLEFT leads to (8, 8) (my current body will be at (8, 8) after I move). Wait, if I move RIGHT, my new body is [(9, 8), (8, 8)].\nIf next turn I am at (9, 8), I can go DOWN, UP, or LEFT.\nLEFT goes to (8, 8) which is occupied by my body (specifically, the neck).\nSo I cannot go LEFT back into my own body immediately (that's going backwards).\nSo from (9, 8) I can go UP or DOWN.\nThat's fine. 2 options. Not a dead end.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 7):\nNew body: [(8, 7), (8, 8)].\nNext turn, from (8, 7), I can go DOWN, UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\nDOWN -> (8, 6)\nUP -> (8, 8) (My body will be at (8, 8)? No, my body will be [(8, 7), (8, 8)]. So UP goes to (8, 8) which is occupied. So UP is backwards/dead.\nRIGHT -> (9, 7)\nLEFT -> (7, 7)\nSo from (8, 7) I have 3 options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\nFrom (9, 8) I have 2 options (DOWN, UP).\nSo (8, 7) is better for keeping options open.\n\nAlso, moving DOWN puts me on the x=8 column. The apple at (8, 2) is on that column.\nMoving RIGHT puts me on x=9.\nThe apple at (8, 2) is a valid target.\nSo DOWN is the best move.\n\nFinal check for safety:\nMove DOWN to (8, 7).\nIs (8, 7) occupied?\nMy body: [(7, 8)].\nEnemy #1: (5, 2).\nNo.\nIs it out of bounds? No.\nIs it backwards? No (currently facing RIGHT or UP? I came from (7, 8) to (8, 8), so facing RIGHT. DOWN is not backwards).\n\nSo the move is DOWN.\n\nRationale:\nI am at (8, 8). My body is at (7, 8).\nMoving LEFT is fatal (into own body).\nMoving UP moves away from most apples.\nMoving RIGHT or DOWN are both safe.\nMoving DOWN is preferred because it keeps me in the central column (x=8) which allows access to both the apple at (8, 2) and the apple at (9, 5) without getting trapped on the wall. It also maintains more open space for future turns (3 options vs 2 if I move to the wall).\n\nPlan:\nMove DOWN to (8, 7).\nHead towards the apple at (8, 2) or (9, 5).\nAvoid Snake #1 (currently at 5,2).\n\nDecision:\nDOWN.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nCurrent situation: I am at head (8, 8). The apple at (7, 8) has been eaten (it is my current tail). My body is [(7, 8)]. The closest apples are at (9, 5) (distance 4) and (8, 2) (distance 6). The enemy snake is at (5, 2), which is far away and poses no immediate threat.\n\nI have four possible moves:\n- LEFT: Moves to (7, 8), which is occupied by my own body. This is suicide.\n- UP: Moves to (8, 9). This moves me away from the apples and puts me on the corner wall, restricting future movement.\n- RIGHT: Moves to (9, 8). This is safe and moves me closer to the apple at (9, 5). However, it puts me on the wall, limiting my next move options to DOWN or UP (LEFT would be back into my body).\n- DOWN: Moves to (8, 7). This is safe and moves me closer to both apples: (9, 5) and (8, 2). Crucially, it keeps me in the center column, maintaining open paths to the left and right (DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT options next turn).\n\nStrategy: Flexibility is key in early game. While RIGHT moves me slightly faster towards (9, 5), DOWN moves me towards (8, 2) which is part of a denser cluster of apples ((5, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0)), while not sacrificing the (9, 5) target significantly. It also avoids getting pinned against the wall.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (8, 7). From there, I will likely continue down towards (8, 2) or turn towards (9, 5) depending on the enemy's movement. I will maintain distance from Snake #1.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

This is suicide.\n- UP: Moves to (8, 9). This moves me away from the apples and puts me on the corner wall, restricting future movement.\n- RIGHT: Moves to (9, 8). This is safe and moves me closer to the apple at (9, 5). However, it puts me on the wall, limiting my next move options to DOWN or UP (LEFT would be back into my body).\n- DOWN: Moves to (8, 7). This is safe and moves me closer to both apples: (9, 5) and (8, 2). Crucially, it keeps me in the center column, maintaining open paths to the left and right (DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT options next turn).\n\nStrategy: Flexibility is key in early game. While RIGHT moves me slightly faster towards (9, 5), DOWN moves me towards (8, 2) which is part of a denser cluster of apples ((5, 0), (1, 0), (0, 0)), while not sacrificing the (9, 5) target significantly. It also avoids getting pinned against the wall.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (8, 7). From there, I will likely continue down towards (8, 2) or turn towards (9, 5) depending on the enemy's movement. I will maintain distance from Snake #1.\n\nDOWN",

Moves me toward the cluster at (0,0), (1,0), (0,3), but it's currently a longer path. Keeps me in the open.\n    *   **RIGHT (9, 6):** Moves me to the right wall. Moves closer to the apple at (9, 5) (vertical distance). However, being on the wall restricts movement next turn (no RIGHT move possible).\n\n*   **Strategy:** Avoid the wall to maintain maneuverability. Moving DOWN is the strongest move because:\n    1.  It targets the apple at (8, 2) which is vertically aligned and relatively close.\n    2.  It maintains a central position with high flexibility (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN options).\n    3.

The closest cluster is centered around (1, 0). Enemy snake #1 is at (3, 0), currently blocking access to the right side of that cluster (specifically the apple at (1, 0)). I should move towards the bottom edge to get into position to intercept these apples once the enemy moves out of the way. Moving LEFT is the first step in traversing the board towards those apples.\n\n**Immediate Decision:**\nMoving **LEFT** is the only move that progresses toward the nearest cluster of apples in the bottom-left. Moving UP or DOWN would result in a wall bounce or require a later turn to correct course, delaying access to scoring opportunities.
