My snake is at (4,7) and the enemy is at (3,1).\nMy potential moves:\n- UP to (4,8): Safe, open space.\n- DOWN to (4,6): Safe, open space.\n- LEFT to (3,7): Safe, open space.\n- RIGHT to (5,7): Safe, open space.\n\nI need to prioritize reaching apples. The apples are at (8,4), (8,0), (4,2), (0,0), (2,9).\nCalculating distances:\n- (2,9): I can go UP/LEFT. 2 moves.\n- (4,2): I can go DOWN. 5 moves.\n- (8,4): I can go DOWN/RIGHT. 5 moves.\n- (0,0): 11 moves.\n- (8,0): 11 moves.\n\nI want to move towards the closer apples. The closest are (2,9) and (4,2).\nMoving UP targets (2,9). Moving DOWN targets (4,2).\nI am at y=7. (2,9) is North-East. (4,2) is South.\nIf I go UP, I go to (4,8). From there I can go LEFT to (3,8) to get closer to (2,9).\nIf I go DOWN, I go to (4,6). From there I can go DOWN to (4,5)... (4,2).\n\nI should also consider the enemy snake. It is at (3,1). It is far away. It will likely go for (0,0) or (4,2). If it goes for (4,2), it is closer to it than I am (distance 1 vs 5).\nWait, the enemy is at (3,1). (4,2) is distance 2 (Right + Up). I am distance 5.\nIf the enemy moves Right to (4,1), then Up to (4,2), it gets the apple quickly.\nIf I move Down, I am getting closer to (4,2), but the enemy might take it first.\nIf I move Up, I go for (2,9), which the enemy is very far from. That seems safer to guarantee an apple.\n\nLet's verify (2,9) is empty. The board shows row 9, column 2 is 'A'. Yes, an apple is at (2,9).\nThe board shows row 8 is empty.\nRow 9 has an apple at column 2.\nSo UP to (4,8) is a good first step towards (2,9).\nIs there any obstacle? No.\nIs moving UP safe? Yes.\n\nLong-term plan: Move UP to (4,8) to target the apple at (2,9). This path is safer than going for (4,2) which the enemy might contest.\n\nMove: UP\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n1.  **Current Position:** (4, 7).\n2.  **Enemy:** (3, 1) - Far away.\n3.  **Apples:**\n    *   (2, 9): Distance 2 (Manhattan).\n    *   (4, 2): Distance 5.\n4.  **Safety Check:**\n    *   UP: (4, 8) - Empty. Safe.\n    *   DOWN: (4, 6) - Empty. Safe.\n    *   LEFT: (3, 7) - Empty. Safe.\n    *   RIGHT: (5, 7) - Empty. Safe.\n5.  **Strategy:**\n    *   Targeting (2, 9) seems the most efficient path to an apple. It also moves me away from the enemy at (3, 1).\n    *   Moving UP is the correct first step.\n\n**Strategy Note:** Target apple at (2,9). Move UP to (4,8).\n\nUP",
