Moving RIGHT would leave me with only LEFT or UP later, but I\u2019m already farther from the nearest apple.\n\n3. **Head\u2011on collision risk** \u2013 The opponent\u2019s head is at (5,\u202f6). None of the opponent\u2019s likely next positions intersect (2,\u202f5), so moving UP does not create a head\u2011on collision risk this turn.\n\n4. **Safety margin** \u2013 UP is not on the board edge and the target cell is empty, giving a comfortable safety margin.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan (next few turns)**  \n- Continue moving upward while staying clear of my own tail.  \n- Once at (2,\u202f5), prepare to head left toward the apple at (0,\u202f5) or adjust right toward (7,\u202f4) depending on opponent positioning.  \n- Keep monitoring enemy head positions to avoid any head\u2011on collisions.\n\n**Chosen move**\n\nUP\nUP",

This cell is empty and contains no enemy body, so it is safe, but after moving the snake will be stuck on the left edge with only a downward option for the next turn.  \n- **DOWN** moves to (1,\u202f8). This cell is empty, not part of any snake\u2019s body, and leaves the head surrounded by three potentially free directions (LEFT, RIGHT, UP) after the move, preserving flexibility.\n\nAmong the safe moves, **DOWN** keeps the snake away from the edge, maintains multiple viable follow\u2011up directions, and does not block future apple\u2011collecting opportunities.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN now to stay central, keep several open adjacent cells for the next turn, and avoid becoming trapped at the board edge.\n\nDOWN",
