DOWN to (5,4) could lead to quick trapping along x=5 (own body at (5,2) blocks long-term). LEFT to (4,5) opens better middfa- to long-term paths: next left to (3,5), then up to eat (3,6) safely, then possibly up again to (3,7) for a double eat, gaining a lead while dodging enemy (who seem focused tops-right). This avoids dead ends and head-on risks, with branches (to x=3 then right/up/down).\n\nPlan for next: Go LEFT twice quickly (to (3,5)), then UP to eat (3,6). If eaten, from (3,6), up to (3,7) immediately for another eat; otherwise branch right to (4,6) if safe, or down to regroup. Watch enemy movements, avoid chasing directly into their path.\n\nLEFT",
