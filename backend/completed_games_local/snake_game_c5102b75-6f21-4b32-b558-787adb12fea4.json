I need to be careful of Snake #1 as it moves up from the bottom right; however, currently, it is likely heading for (8, 1). \n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (4, 5).

The enemy snake is at (5, 1), which is 3 units away from (5, 4) vertically; they cannot reach it this turn.

Then, evaluate the board to decide between heading for (1, 2) or (8, 3) depending on the enemy's trajectory.\n\nLEFT",

I am far enough away that a collision at (9, 7) is impossible.\n\n**Plan for future self:**\nCollect the apple at (9, 7). Since I'm moving right to the wall, I will then proceed UP column 9. After (9, 7), I will look at the state of the remaining apples. If Snake #1 hasn't taken (3, 8) or (2, 7), I will cut across the top of the board to contest them.\n\nRIGHT",

By moving LEFT, I begin to contest the center and provide a path to either the top-left apple or the bottom-left group.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will move left and then determine if I can cut across at Row 6 or 7 to intercept the apples at the bottom-left.

Moving LEFT this turn puts you on a direct path to that apple via (1,7) and then (1,8), allowing a growth next turn. Going DOWN to (2,6) would not grant an immediate apple this turn and would require extra moves to reach any nearby apples, delaying growth.\n- Enemies: Enemy #0 is far to the right and does not present an immediate collision risk on this turn if you choose LEFT. There\u2019s no head-on risk in the immediate next step from (2,7) to either (1,7) or (2,6).\n\nChosen move:\n- LEFT\n\nLong-term plan note:\n- After moving to (1,7), aim to eat the apple at (1,8) on the next turn by moving UP to (1,8). If you eat it, you\u2019ll grow and secure more length, which helps with survival and future escape options.\n- If the apple at (1,8) is still contested by enemy movement or if the path gets tight, consider transitioning toward the bottom-left apple cluster (near (0,0), (0,1), (1,0)) or continuing toward (1,2) to balance growth vs. space. Always avoid tightening into walls or into the enemy\u2019s potential corridor.\n\nLEFT",

This is a less contested area.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will move toward the apple at (7, 1) first. While the cluster at the bottom-left is tempting, Snake #1 is much closer to it. By moving toward (7, 1), I secure a point and keep my body stretched out in open space, avoiding the congestion likely to happen in the bottom-left corner.

Since Snake #1 is occupied with the cluster at the bottom-left, I am uncontested for (7, 1). After securing (7, 1), I will check the remaining apple counts.

Since the enemy is likely to gain 3 points soon, I must secure (7, 1) and then look to move toward (9, 8) or wait for new spawns in the center.

My body at (7, 1) through (7, 5) creates a wall to my left, so moving UP is the most logical path to maintain freedom of movement. Snake #1 is currently navigating a tight cluster on the left side of the board. Moving UP towards (8, 3) allows me to eventually loop around to the top apples or stay along the right wall.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue moving UP along the x=8 or x=9 columns. The target is the apple at (9, 8). Once near the top, I can evaluate whether to take (9, 8) or cross over to (3, 8) depending on where Snake #1 moves.\n\nUP",

It keeps me parallel to my own body wall (at x=7), preventing me from getting trapped. It also sets me up to grab the apple at (9, 8) or move across the top of the board to (3, 8). \n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAscend the x=8 or x=9 column to reach the apple at (9, 8). If Snake #1 captures the apples at (2, 4) or (0, 4), it will likely head toward (3, 8) or (4, 0). By staying on the right side, I maintain maximum space.

Moving UP to (8, 6) is the most logical path. It moves me further away from the horizontal segment of my body at (7, 5) and positions me to sweep the top right corner where two apples are located [(9, 8), (8, 9)]. \n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue moving UP until I reach y=8 or y=9. Once at the top, I will collect the apple at (8, 9) and then (9, 8). Snake #1 is far enough away on the left side of the board that it shouldn't be a threat to these specific apples yet.

This move collects the apple at (8, 9). It is the most direct and efficient path.\n- **DOWN (8, 7):** **DEATH** (Backwards into neck).\n- **LEFT (7, 8):** **SAFE**, but no immediate benefit. It moves away from the cluster of apples at (8, 9) and (9, 8).\n- **RIGHT (9, 8):** **SAFE**. This move collects the apple at (9, 8). However, moving to (8, 9) first allows a cleaner path to collect both (8, 9) and then (9, 8) by looping around.\n\n**Strategy:**\nMy goal is to collect the nearby apples. The apple at (8, 9) is directly above me. After taking it, the apple at (9, 8) will be adjacent to my position. The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (3, 7) and will likely target the apple at (3, 8), so there is no immediate competition for the (8, 9)/(9, 8) cluster.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to (8, 9) to collect the first apple. In the following turn, I will move RIGHT to (9, 9) and then DOWN to (9, 8) to secure the second apple. This pathing ensures I don't trap myself against the boundaries and leaves the rest of the board open for future navigation.\n\nUP",

This move lands on an apple and remains on the board.\n\n**Safe Move Selection:**\nOnly **DOWN** is a valid move. It allows me to collect the apple at (9, 8).\n\n**Potential Risks:**\nSnake 1 is at (2, 8). It cannot reach (9, 8) this turn. There are no other snakes. The only danger is boxing myself in, but moving down the 9th column is currently the most open path since my own body occupies the 8th column.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (9, 8) and collecting the apple, my next objective is the apple at (9, 5). I will continue moving DOWN along the right wall. This keeps me away from my own body at x=8. Once I reach (9, 5), I will evaluate the path toward the remaining apples at (4, 0) or (1, 5).\n\nDOWN",

Move LEFT to (5, 5).\n2. Move UP to (5, 6) to collect the first apple.\n3. Move LEFT to (4, 6) to collect the second apple.\n4. After those, reassess the position of Snake 1.

The enemy head is at (4, 9), so we are 3 units apart vertically. This is safe. Since my body is quite long and curled around the right side, the middle-left of the board is the safest area to occupy.\n- **UP (5, 7):** Safe, but ignores the immediate apple at (4, 6).\n- **RIGHT (6, 6):** Safe, but moves away from apples and toward the wall.\n- **DOWN (5, 5):** **DEATH** (Backwards into body).\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- I am tied with Snake 1 at 16 apples. Collecting (4, 6) puts me ahead.\n- Snake 1 is at (4, 9) and likely moving down or lingering in the top-left.\n- After taking (4, 6), I have a clear path to go DOWN towards the cluster of apples at the bottom (4, 0), (2, 1), and (2, 0).\n- My current tail is at (8, 9). Moving left creates space between my head and my long trail on the right.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1. Move LEFT to (4, 6) to eat the apple and take the lead.\n2. Continue moving DOWN (toward row 0/1) to collect the remaining three apples (4, 0), (2, 1), and (2, 0). This path is relatively clear of both my own body and the enemy segments.\n3. Keep an eye on Snake 1; if they move to intercept row 4, I will pivot further left or right depending on body placement.\n\nLEFT",

This continues my path toward the cluster of apples at (4, 0), (2, 1), and (2, 0). It also keeps me in the relatively open center-left part of the board.\n- **LEFT (3, 5):** Safe.

If I move LEFT toward (3, 5), I am technically closing the distance, though still several moves away from a collision.\n- The most valuable area for me right now is the bottom-left quadrant. Snake 1 is currently lingering in the top-left/top-center.\n- My tail is currently winding around the right and top edges. I need to ensure I don't trap myself in the bottom-left if I can't loop back out. However, the board is currently 10x10 and I am length 18, so I have plenty of space.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will move DOWN to (4, 4) and continue toward the southern apples. Specifically, (4, 0) is a straight shot. After securing the bottom cluster, I will evaluate the safest path to return to the upper board or sweep the remaining apple at (8, 1) if my tail has cleared enough.\n\nDOWN",

This is my own body.\n- **LEFT (4, 4):** **DEATH**. This is my own body (backwards move).\n- **RIGHT (6, 4):** **SAFE** and **TASTY**. This moves me onto an apple. It puts me adjacent to my body at (7, 4) and (6, 5), but (6, 4) itself is currently empty or has an apple.\n- **DOWN (5, 3):** **SAFE**. Moves toward the bottom cluster.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- I am tied for the lead. The apple at (6, 4) is directly in front of me. Taking it is the priority to break the tie.\n- Snake #1 is currently coiled near (3, 6) and (3, 7). It is relatively far, but I must be careful not to trap myself against my own body at x=7.\n- After taking (6, 4), I will need to maneuver carefully. Going further RIGHT to (7, 4) would be a collision. I will likely need to move DOWN toward the cluster at the bottom (8, 1), (4, 0), etc.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to consume the apple at (6, 4). Once the apple is consumed, I will be at (6, 4). Since (7, 4) and (6, 5) are occupied by my body, my only viable exit from that cell will be DOWN to (6, 3).

This cell is empty.\n- **LEFT (5, 3):** SAFE. This cell is empty.\n- **RIGHT (7, 3):** DEATH (My body).\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n1. **DOWN (6, 2):** A safe move. From (6, 2), I can move toward the apple at (8, 1) or move left toward the cluster of apples at (4, 0), (2, 1), etc. However, my tail at (7, 2) and segments at (8, 2), (9, 2) create a slight barrier.\n2. **LEFT (5, 3):** A safe move. This opens up the center of the board. From (5, 3), I can head directly toward the apple at (1, 3) or (4, 0). Snake #1 is at (2, 5), moving toward similar targets, but is currently blocked by its own tail and my body structure to some extent.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Moving **LEFT** toward (5, 3) is generally better for mobility as it gets me away from the \"wall\" formed by my tail on the right side of the board. \n- The apple at (1, 3) and (4, 0) are high priority. Snake #1 is closer to (1, 3) but must navigate around its own body.\n- By moving LEFT, I maintain more central board control.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (5, 3) to approach the apples in the bottom-left quadrant. This avoids getting pinched against my own tail at (7, 2). I will monitor Snake #1's path; they are currently at (2, 5) and likely heading down for the same apples.\n\nLEFT",

Leads to (4, 0), (2, 1), (2, 0).\n- **LEFT (4, 2):** SAFE. Leads towards (2, 1), (2, 0), and (1, 3).\n- **RIGHT (6, 2):** SAFE. Note that my tail at (7, 2) and (8, 2) is currently moving out of the way. However, Snake #1 is at (2, 3), so moving right is safe but moves away from the nearest apples.\n\n**Move Analysis:**\n1. **LEFT (4, 2):** Moves toward the apple at (1, 3) and the cluster at (2, 1), (2, 0).\n2. **DOWN (5, 1):** Provides a direct path to (4, 0) and then the (2, 1)/(2, 0) cluster. This is very safe and maintains distance from Snake #1.\n3. **Snake #1's likely moves:** Snake #1 is at (2, 3). It will likely target (1, 3) or move down toward (2, 1).\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nI have an 18-17 lead. My body is currently coiled in the middle-right. By moving **DOWN**, I enter the open bottom area. The apple at (4, 0) is only 2 moves away. The apple at (1, 3) is likely to be contested by Snake #1. By going for (4, 0) first, I secure a point and remain in a position to take (2, 1) and (2, 0) depending on Snake #1's movement.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (5, 1) and then to (4, 0) to secure that apple. From (4, 0), I can evaluate the status of the apples at (2, 1) and (2, 0). If Snake #1 goes for (1, 3), I can sweep the bottom row. This keeps me in the lead and keeps me in an open area while my long tail clears out from the (9, 4) area.\n\nDOWN",

It is very close to the apples at (2, 1) and (1, 3).\n- I have an apple directly \"below-left\" at (4, 0) and one to my right at (8, 1).\n- If I move **LEFT (4, 1)**, I am one step away from (4, 0) and (2, 1). However, moving left brings me closer to Snake #1's head, potentially creating a confrontation or allowing them to cut me off from the bottom row.\n- If I move **DOWN (5, 0)**, I can reach (4, 0) on the next turn. This is a very safe path that keeps me away from Snake #1 and secures an immediate point.\n- If I move **RIGHT (6, 1)**, I head toward (8, 1). While safe, (4, 0) is closer.\n\n**Strategy:**\nSecuring the lead is a priority. Snake #1 is likely to grab (2, 1) or (1, 3). By moving to (5, 0), I position myself to take (4, 0) immediately. This also gives me the option to then move along the bottom edge (X, 0) to grab (2, 0) before Snake #1 can reach it from (2, 1), or pivot back if they block that path.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (5, 0) to collect the apple at (4, 0) on the next turn.\n\nDOWN",

Open area.\n- **DOWN:** DEATH (Off the board).\n- **LEFT (4, 0):** APPLE. Immediate score increase.\n\n**Detailed Analysis:**\n- Snake #1 is at (2, 1). They are very close to the apple at (2, 0) and (1, 3).\n- I am at (5, 0). The apple at (4, 0) is directly to my left.\n- Moving LEFT to (4, 0) secures an apple immediately.\n- If Snake #1 moves to (3, 1) or (2, 0) this turn, they are still a safe distance from my head.\n- After taking (4, 0), I need to be careful of Snake #1 as we are both operating in the bottom-left corner. However, (4, 0) is a guaranteed point and keeps me in the lead or tied for the lead depending on Snake #1's move.\n\n**Strategy:**\nTake the high-percentage move. Moving LEFT to (4, 0) secures 19 apples. From there, I can assess whether to contest (2, 0) or retreat towards the right side of the board to grab (8, 1). To the right, (6, 0) or (7, 0) are also safe paths to escape potential trapping by Snake #1.\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to (4, 0) to collect the apple.\n\nLEFT",

Snake #1 is at (2, 0) and has several apples directly above them at (1, 3), (1, 4), and (1, 6). My current position (4, 0) is trapped between the bottom edge, my own body at (5, 0), and Snake #1. \n- Moving LEFT to (3, 0) risks a head-on collision or getting pinned against the edge.\n- Moving UP to (4, 1) is the safest escape route. From (4, 1), I can move towards the apple at (8, 1) or navigate around my own body to reach the upper-right apples.\n- Note that (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3) are currently empty, providing a clear path upward.\n\n**Strategy:**\nAvoid the head-on collision risk at (3, 0) and exit the bottom row.

Move towards the cluster of apples at x=1.\n- **RIGHT (5, 1):** DEATH (Into body).\n\n**Detailed Analysis:**\nI am currently in a somewhat restricted position. My own body occupies much of the x=5 to x=7 area.\n- Snake #1 is at (1, 0) and is likely moving UP towards the apples at (1, 3), (1, 4), and (1, 6).\n- If I move LEFT to (3, 1), I get closer to those apples, but I might find myself in a head-to-head competition with Snake #1 in a very narrow vertical corridor (Snake #1's body is at x=2, and my tail/body is at x=4/5).\n- Moving UP to (4, 2) is very safe and keeps my options open. From (4, 2), I can then decide to go RIGHT towards the apple at (8, 1) (by looping around my body at 5, 2) or LEFT to contest the apples at (1, 3/4/6).\n- Looking at (8, 1): To get there, I have to navigate around the \"wall\" formed by my segments at x=5. I would need to go up to (4, 7) or down to (4, 1) then right. Since (5, 1) and (6, 1) are currently empty, I can't go right immediately.\n\n**Strategy:**\nMove to (4, 2) to maintain flexibility. This avoids the immediate congestion near Snake #1 and allows me to observe their movement before committing to the left-side apples or looking for a path to the right-side apple at (8, 1).\n\nUP",

This is a very open move. It avoids the narrow corridor at x=2 and sets me up to potentially intercept the apples at (1, 3), (1, 4), or (1, 6).\n- **DOWN (3, 1):** SAFE. This move keeps me in a tighter area but is technically safe for now.\n- **LEFT (2, 2):** DEATH. Snake #1's head is at (1, 2), but its body segment is at (2, 2).\n- **RIGHT (4, 2):** DEATH (Backwards into body).\n\n**Comparison and Strategy:**\nSnake #1 is at (1, 2). Their most likely move is UP toward the apple at (1, 3).\nIf I move UP to (3, 3), I maintain a distance from Snake #1's body (x=2) and my own body (x=4).\nIf I move DOWN to (3, 1), I am moving away from the cluster of apples in the upper-left and deeper into a region boxed in by my body and Snake #1's body.\n\nThe best path is UP. From (3, 3), I can assess Snake #1's movement. If they continue up the x=1 column, I can stay parallel at x=3 or attempt to cut across if a gap opens in their body or if they move away. Since our scores are tied (19-19), obtaining the next few apples is critical. \n\n**Plan:** Move UP to (3, 3) to maintain maneuverability and contest the left-side apples.\n\nUP",
