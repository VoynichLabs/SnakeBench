DOWN is dead\n2. RIGHT collects an apple immediately\n3. LEFT and UP are safe but don't collect apples\n\nSince I can collect an apple immediately by moving RIGHT to (3, 7), this is the optimal move. It gives me 2 apples total (1 point ahead of Snake #1 who has 5 apples). Snake #1 will likely move UP to (9, 2), so there's no immediate threat to my position.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to collect the apple at (3, 7). This puts me at 2 apples total. Then I can continue toward the cluster of apples on the right side of the board while monitoring Snake #1's movements.\nRIGHT\n**END RATIONALE**",

Moving LEFT keeps us in the middle of the board but does not give an immediate apple. Moving DOWN steps onto (3,7) which contains an apple; it is empty of other heads this turn, and after the move we will grow and still have LEFT, RIGHT and DOWN (to (3,6)) as viable exits. Therefore the best immediate choice is to go DOWN to claim the apple and stay flexible.\n\nPlan: Eat the (3,7) apple now, then head upward toward the (3,9) apple while keeping LEFT and RIGHT options open for later turns.\nDOWN",
