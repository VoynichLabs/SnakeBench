The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (7,4) with no body.\n\nSince this is turn 0, all snakes are just starting. I need to choose a safe move that doesn't kill me and ideally moves toward an apple while keeping future options open.\n\nPossible moves from (4,7):\n- UP: (4,8) - within board, no snake body there currently.\n- DOWN: (4,6) - within board, no snake body.\n- LEFT: (3,7) - within board, no snake body.\n- RIGHT: (5,7) - within board, no snake body.\n\nAll four moves are safe because there are no bodies on the board (only heads) and moving backwards isn't an issue since there's no body segment behind the head. So no immediate death from any move.\n\nNow, consider the apples:\n- (6,4) is to the right and down.\n- (5,0) is far down.\n- (3,9) is left and up.\n- (7,2) is right and down.\n- (6,7) is right and same y.\n\nThe closest apple seems to be (6,7) at (6,7) which is 2 steps to the right (same y). Also (3,9) is 2 steps left and 2 up.\n\nBut I should also consider the enemy snake at (7,4). It might be heading for apples too, but currently it's not a direct threat since it's far away.\n\nTo maximize future options, I should avoid moving into corners or edges unnecessarily. Since I'm at (4,7), which is relatively central, all directions are open.\n\nMoving RIGHT towards (6,7) seems efficient. However, moving RIGHT to (5,7) is safe and gets me closer to (6,7). Also, there are other apples in that general direction (like (7,2) and (6,4)).\n\nMoving LEFT to (3,7) gets me closer to (3,9), but that's up and left.\n\nUP to (4,8) or DOWN to (4,6) don't directly approach any apple, but they keep options open.\n\nGiven that (6,7) is very close (only 2 away), and there are multiple apples to the right/down, I think RIGHT is a good choice.\n\nAlso, the enemy is at (7,4), which is to the right and down, but not directly in my path to (6,7). So no immediate collision risk.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose RIGHT.\n\nLong-term plan: Head towards the cluster of apples to the right (like (6,7), (7,2), (6,4)) while avoiding the enemy snake at (7,4). Possibly go for (6,7) first since it's closest.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples are at (5,0), (3,9), (7,2), (6,7), (0,8). Snake #1 is at (6,4) with body at (7,4) (so it has one segment: head at (6,4), tail at (7,4)).\n\nPossible moves from (5,7):\n- UP: (5,8) - within board, no snake body there (enemy body at (7,4) and head at (6,4) are far).\n- DOWN: (5,6) - within board, no snake body.\n- LEFT: (4,7) - within board, no snake body (since I just left (4,7) and have no body, so it's empty).\n- RIGHT: (6,7) - within board, and there is an apple at (6,7)! If I move right, I eat the apple and grow.\n\nIf I move right to (6,7), I eat the apple. After eating, my head becomes (6,7) and I grow a body segment at (5,7) (my previous head). So I'll have a body at (5,7).\n\nNow, check for safety:\n- All moves are within board.\n- No snake body parts at (5,8), (5,6), (4,7), or (6,7) except that (6,7) has an apple (which is not a body part).\n- Moving backwards: LEFT would go to (4,7), which was my previous head? Actually, since I have no body, moving left to (4,7) is safe because it's empty. Similarly, moving backwards isn't an issue until I have a body.\n\nSpecifically for moving right to (6,7): it is safe and I get an apple.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (6,4) with body at (7,4). It might move in any direction. Possible moves for it:\n- From (6,4), it can go UP (6,5), DOWN (6,3), LEFT (5,4), RIGHT (7,4) but (7,4) is its body, so RIGHT would kill it. So enemy cannot move right.\nEnemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n(6,7) is far from enemy (2 rows up and same column? Actually, (6,7) is 3 steps up from (6,4): |7-4|=3, and same x=6. So no immediate collision risk with enemy head.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (6,7) is safe and gets me an apple.\n\nOther moves:\n- UP (5,8): no apple, safe.\n- DOWN (5,6): no apple, safe.\n- LEFT (4,7): no apple, safe.\n\nBut RIGHT gives an immediate apple and growth. So it's clearly the best.\n\nLong-term plan after this: after eating, I'll be at (6,7) with body at (5,7). Then I can consider nearby apples like (7,2) or (3,9) or (0,8). But with one body segment, I need to avoid moving backwards into my body. For example, if I move right to (6,7), then next turn my body is at (5,7), so I cannot move left to (5,7) (which is my body). So future moves from (6,7) would be UP (6,8), DOWN (6,6), RIGHT (7,7), and LEFT (5,7) is blocked by my own body.\n\nSo after eating, I have three safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) and should avoid LEFT.\n\nBut for now, RIGHT is optimal.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT.\nRIGHT",

Snake #1 is at head (6,3) with body at (6,4) (so it has one segment: head at (6,3), tail at (6,4)).\n\nPossible moves from my head (6,7):\n- UP: (6,8) - within board (0 to 9), check for bodies: no snake body there (my body is at (5,7), enemy body at (6,4), enemy head at (6,3)).\n- DOWN: (6,6) - within board, no bodies.\n- LEFT: (5,7) - but this is my own body segment! Moving left would kill me (into my own body). So LEFT is invalid.\n- RIGHT: (7,7) - within board, no bodies.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider apples:\n- (7,2) is far down and right, (3,9) is far left and up, (0,8) far left, (0,5) far left and down, (5,0) far down.\nNone are immediately adjacent.\n\nBut (3,9) is at top left, and (0,8) is also top left. From (6,7), moving UP (to (6,8)) gets closer to the top row where (3,9) and (0,8) are. Moving RIGHT (to (7,7)) doesn't get closer to any apple directly. Moving DOWN (to (6,6)) goes away from most apples (except (5,0) is very far down).\n\nSo UP seems better for approaching apples.\n\nAlso consider enemy snake #1 at (6,3). It might move:\n- UP (6,4) but (6,4) is its body, so invalid.\n- DOWN (6,2) - safe.\n- LEFT (5,3) - safe.\n- RIGHT (7,3) - safe.\n\nSo enemy can move DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. It is currently below me at y=3, while I am at y=7. So no immediate collision risk.\n\nNow, future moves: after this move, I will have two body segments: head at new position, and body at (6,7) and (5,7). So I need to avoid (5,7) and (6,7) in future.\n\nIf I move UP to (6,8), next turn I can move UP (6,9), DOWN (6,7) but (6,7) will be my body? Actually, after moving UP, my body becomes [ (6,7), (5,7) ] in order. So head at (6,8), body segments at (6,7) and (5,7). So next turn, I cannot move DOWN to (6,7) (my body). Similarly, if I move RIGHT to (7,7), body becomes [ (6,7), (5,7) ], so next turn I cannot move LEFT to (6,7). So both UP and RIGHT leave three safe moves next turn (for UP: UP, LEFT, RIGHT; for RIGHT: UP, DOWN, RIGHT).\n\nMoving DOWN to (6,6) is safe, but it moves me away from the apples at top. Also, next turn from (6,6) with body at (6,7) and (5,7), I can move UP (6,7) but that is my body! So DOWN would leave me with only two safe moves next turn: DOWN (6,5) and RIGHT (7,6) and LEFT (5,6). Actually, UP is blocked by body at (6,7). So DOWN gives only three moves? Wait: from (6,6), adjacent:\n- UP (6,7) is body - invalid.\n- DOWN (6,5) - safe.\n- LEFT (5,6) - safe.\n- RIGHT (7,6) - safe.\nSo three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nBut moving DOWN goes away from apples, so it is less desirable.\n\nTherefore, UP is best: it gets me closer to apples at top left (like (3,9) and (0,8)), and has good future options.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving UP to (6,8), I should consider moving left towards (3,9) or (0,8). For example, next turn I can move LEFT to (5,8) and then continue left. But need to avoid enemy? Enemy is at bottom, so safe.\n\nSo choose UP.\n\nFinal decision: UP\nUP",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\nYour snake (ID 0):\n- Head: (6, 8)\n- Body: [(6, 7)] (so tail is at (6,7))\n- Apples collected: 1\n\nApples: (5,0), (3,9), (7,2), (0,8), (0,5)\n\nEnemy snake #1:\n- Head: (7,3)\n- Body: [(6,3)] (so tail is at (6,3))\n\nNow, possible moves from your head (6,8):\n- UP: (6,9) - within board (y=9 is top). Check bodies: no snake body at (6,9) (your body is at (6,7), enemy body at (6,3), enemy head at (7,3)). So safe.\n- DOWN: (6,7) - but this is your own body (tail)! Moving backwards into your own body is fatal. So DOWN is invalid.\n- LEFT: (5,8) - within board. Check bodies: no body there. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,8) - within board. Check bodies: no body there. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, consider apples:\n- (3,9) is at top left, (0,8) is top left, (0,5) is left bottom, (5,0) is bottom, (7,2) is right bottom.\nFrom (6,8), moving LEFT (to (5,8)) gets closer to (3,9) and (0,8). Moving UP (to (6,9)) also gets closer to (3,9) and (0,8). Moving RIGHT (to (7,8)) moves away from these apples.\n\nSo UP and LEFT are better for approaching apples.\n\nEnemy snake #1 at (7,3) is far below (y=3 vs your y=8). It can move:\n- UP: (7,4) - safe (no bodies)\n- DOWN: (7,2) - safe (no bodies, but apple at (7,2) - so it might go there)\n- LEFT: (6,3) - but this is its own body? Wait: enemy body is [(6,3)] which is its tail. So moving LEFT to (6,3) would be into its own body? Actually, the body list is [(6,3)] meaning the head is at (7,3) and the body segment (tail) is at (6,3). So moving LEFT to (6,3) is moving backwards into its own body - which is fatal. So LEFT is invalid for enemy.\n- RIGHT: (8,3) - safe.\n\nSo enemy can only move UP, DOWN, RIGHT. It cannot move LEFT. It might go DOWN to (7,2) to eat the apple there. So enemy is not an immediate threat to you.\n\nFuture moves: After this move, your body will be [ (6,8), (6,7) ] (head moves to new position, and the old head becomes body, and the tail remains until you eat an apple). So you have two segments: head and one body.\n\nIf you move UP to (6,9):\n- Next turn, from (6,9), you can move:\n  - UP: off board (y=10) - invalid.\n  - DOWN: (6,8) - but that will be your body (since after this move, your body is at (6,8) and (6,7)). So invalid.\n  - LEFT: (5,9) - safe.\n  - RIGHT: (7,9) - safe.\nSo only two safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT. This is risky because you are at the top edge.\n\nIf you move LEFT to (5,8):\n- Next turn, from (5,8), you can move:\n  - UP: (5,9) - safe.\n  - DOWN: (5,7) - safe (no body there? Your body will be at (6,8) and (6,7) - so (5,7) is free).\n  - LEFT: (4,8) - safe.\n  - RIGHT: (6,8) - but that is your body (since after moving left, your body is [ (6,8), (6,7) ]). So invalid.\nSo three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nIf you move RIGHT to (7,8):\n- Next turn, from (7,8), you can move:\n  - UP: (7,9) - safe.\n  - DOWN: (7,7) - safe.\n  - LEFT: (6,8) - your body - invalid.\n  - RIGHT: (8,8) - safe.\nSo three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nSo moving LEFT or RIGHT gives more future options than moving UP (which traps you at the top edge).\n\nNow, apples: (3,9) and (0,8) are top-left. Moving LEFT to (5,8) is directly towards them. Moving UP to (6,9) is also towards them but with fewer future moves. Moving RIGHT is away.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best choice: it gets you closer to the apples and maintains good future mobility.\n\nLong-term plan: After moving LEFT to (5,8), next turn consider moving further LEFT to (4,8) or UP to (5,9) to approach (3,9). Avoid moving RIGHT back to (6,8) as it is your body. Also, watch for enemy #1 which is far below but might come up later.\n\nFinal decision: LEFT\nLEFT",

Check bodies: no body there. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (4,8) - your own body (first segment). Moving into your own body is fatal.

The limited mobility next turn is acceptable because you can then move LEFT to (2,9) or RIGHT to (4,9) and continue.\n\nPlan after eating:\n- After moving UP to (3,9) and eating, your head will be at (3,9) with body [ (3,8), (4,8) ].\n- Next turn, consider moving LEFT to (2,9) to approach (1,9) and (0,8). Alternatively, RIGHT to (4,9) might be safe if there are no threats, but left is better for the apples.\n- Enemy snake #1 is still distant, so focus on collecting apples.\n\nUP",

Actually, last turn I moved RIGHT to (1,8) which had an apple. So it should be eaten and my snake grew. But the state shows head at (1,8) and body length 5 segments? Actually, initial body had 5 segments (including head) and I ate an apple, so now it should be 6. But the state says \"Body: [(0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9)]\" which is 5 segments. Wait, let's check: head is (1,8), then body segments: (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9). So total length is 6 (head + 5 body). That matches apples collected: 5 (initial) +1 =6? But scores say \"Your snake (ID 0) apples: 5\". There might be a discrepancy. Actually, the state says \"Apples collected: 5\" for my snake. So perhaps the apple at (1,8) was not there? Or it was already eaten? The board state shows at (1,8) there is '0' (my head) and no apple. So it was eaten. But why is apples collected still 5? Probably the state is after the move: head moved to (1,8) and ate the apple, so apples collected becomes 6? But it says 5. This is confusing.\n\nLooking at the board:\nRow 8: \"T 0 . . . . . . A .\" so at (1,8) is my head '0', and at (8,8) is apple 'A'. So the apple at (1,8) is gone. And my apples collected is 5? It should be 6. But the state says \"Apples collected: 5\". Perhaps it hasn't updated? Or I miscounted.\n\nActually, the initial state last turn had my apples:5. I ate one, so now it should be 6. But the state says \"Your snake (ID 0) apples: 5\". This might be a typo or error. But for safety, we'll use the given state.\n\nSo current head at (1,8), body: [(0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9)]\n\nNearby cells:\n- UP: (1,9) \u2192 my body (segment) \u2192 invalid\n- DOWN: (1,7) \u2192 empty (from board, row7 is all dots)\n- LEFT: (0,8) \u2192 my body (segment) \u2192 invalid\n- RIGHT: (2,8) \u2192 empty (from board, row8: at x=2 is '.')\n\nSo valid moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n**Safety check**\nEnemy snake #1 head at (2,1) with body [(3,1), (3,0), (4,0)]. It is far away (distance 7+ cells) and poses no immediate threat. No risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\n**Consequences**\n- DOWN: (1,7) is empty. No growth, so head moves to (1,7), and tail (3,9) is removed. New body: head (1,7), then (1,8), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,9). This is safe.\n- RIGHT: (2,8) is empty. No growth, so head moves to (2,8), and tail (3,9) is removed. New body: head (2,8), then (1,8), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (2,9). This is safe.\n\n**Future plan**\nFrom (1,7) (if DOWN), I can go DOWN to (1,6) towards (1,2) or (0,5), or LEFT to (0,7) (empty), or RIGHT to (2,7) (empty).\nFrom (2,8) (if RIGHT), I can go DOWN to (2,7) towards (1,2) or (0,5), or LEFT to (1,8) (my body, invalid), or RIGHT to (3,8) (empty), or UP to (2,9) (my body, invalid).\n\nSo both moves have options. But DOWN gets me closer to the apples at (1,2) and (0,5). RIGHT moves me towards the center but also closer to (5,5) eventually.\n\nAlso note apples at (8,9) and (8,8) are far, but we can plan later.\n\nSince DOWN is safe and moves me towards two apples (0,5) and (1,2), it is preferable.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (1,7), head at (1,7). Avoid moving UP to (1,8) as it is body. Consider moving DOWN to (1,6) to approach (1,2) or LEFT to (0,7) to approach (0,5).

RIGHT moves me away from them.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy: it is at (1,1) and might be heading for (1,2) as well. So I should try to get to (1,2) quickly.\n\nAfter moving DOWN to (1,6), next turn I can go DOWN to (1,5) (closer to (1,2)), or LEFT to (0,6) (towards (0,5)), or RIGHT to (2,6). Multiple options.\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (0,7), I can go DOWN to (0,6) (towards (0,5)), or RIGHT to (1,7) (my body, invalid), so only DOWN is safe? Actually, from (0,7), UP is (0,8) which is my body, DOWN is (0,6) empty, LEFT is off-board (-1,7) invalid, RIGHT is (1,7) my body. So only DOWN is safe. That would trap me in a corridor with only one move next turn.\n\nSimilarly, moving RIGHT to (2,7): next turn, UP is (2,8) empty? Actually, (2,8) is empty? Board shows row8: at x=2 is '.'? But my body has (2,9) which is above. From (2,7), UP to (2,8) is safe (empty), DOWN to (2,6) safe, LEFT to (1,7) my body (invalid), RIGHT to (3,7) safe. So two safe moves.\n\nBut RIGHT moves me away from the nearest apples.\n\nSo DOWN is best: it moves towards (1,2) and keeps multiple options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) for next turn.\n\nLEFT is risky because it leaves only one safe move next turn (DOWN), which is dangerous.\n\nRIGHT is safe but less efficient for apple collection.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is optimal.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (1,6), head at (1,6). Next turn, prioritize moving DOWN to (1,5) to approach (1,2) quickly, but also check if enemy is moving towards it. Alternatively, LEFT to (0,6) to approach (0,5) or RIGHT to (2,6) to avoid dead-end. Avoid moving UP to (1,7) as it is body. Enemy is at (1,1) and may also be going for (1,2), so be cautious.\n\nDOWN",

It could move UP to (1,3), DOWN to (1,1) (its body), LEFT to (0,2) (empty), or RIGHT to (2,2) (empty). So it might move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. No immediate threat of collision this turn since we are 4 cells apart vertically.\n\n**Consequences:**\n- DOWN (1,5): no apple, so move head to (1,5), tail (1,9) is removed. New body: head (1,5), then (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9). This moves me towards apple at (0,5) and (3,5).\n- LEFT (0,6): no apple, so head to (0,6), tail removed. New body: head (0,6), then (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9). This moves me towards apple at (0,5).\n- RIGHT (2,6): no apple, so head to (2,6), tail removed. New body: head (2,6), then (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9). This moves me towards center and eventually (5,5) or (3,5).\n\n**Future plan:**\nApples at (0,5) and (3,5) are closest. From (1,6):\n- To (0,5): 1 left and 1 down.\n- To (3,5): 2 right and 1 down.\n- Enemy is at (1,2) and might be heading for (0,5) or (3,5) as well.\n\nMoving DOWN to (1,5) is good: it brings me closer to (0,5) and (3,5). Next turn, from (1,5) I can go DOWN to (1,4) (closer to both), LEFT to (0,5) (apple!), or RIGHT to (2,5) (closer to (3,5)). Multiple options.\n\nMoving LEFT to (0,6): brings me closer to (0,5). Next turn, from (0,6) I can go DOWN to (0,5) (apple!), or RIGHT to (1,6) (my body, invalid), or UP to (0,7) (empty? but my body is at (0,8) and (0,9), so (0,7) is free). Actually, check: (0,7) is empty? Board shows row7: at x=0 is '.'? Yes. So from (0,6), UP (0,7) is safe, DOWN (0,5) is apple, LEFT off-board, RIGHT (1,6) body. So two safe moves (UP and DOWN). But DOWN gets the apple.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2,6): less direct for (0,5) but better for (3,5). Next turn, from (2,6): UP (2,7) empty, DOWN (2,5) empty, LEFT (1,6) body, RIGHT (3,6) empty. So three safe moves.\n\nHowever, the apple at (0,5) is very close and I should prioritize it. Enemy is at (1,2) and might also go for (0,5) by moving LEFT to (0,2) then DOWN, etc. So I should try to get it first.\n\nDOWN gets me to (1,5), which is one step away from (0,5) via LEFT next turn. LEFT gets me to (0,6), which is one step away via DOWN.\n\nBut if I go LEFT to (0,6), I can grab (0,5) next turn with DOWN. However, enemy might also be approaching (0,5). If enemy moves LEFT to (0,2) this turn, then next turn it could go DOWN to (0,1) and then to (0,0) etc., but not directly to (0,5) quickly. Enemy is 3 steps away from (0,5) (e.g., (1,2) -> (0,2) -> (0,3) -> (0,4) -> (0,5)), while I am 2 steps away (if I go LEFT to (0,6) then DOWN to (0,5)).\n\nBut if I go DOWN to (1,5), I am also 2 steps away (LEFT to (0,5) next turn).\n\nSo both DOWN and LEFT are equally good for reaching (0,5) in 2 turns.\n\nHowever, moving LEFT to (0,6) might be slightly riskier because if enemy moves to (0,2) this turn, it could potentially cause a future head-on collision at (0,5). But that is unlikely since I would get there first.\n\nAlso, after going LEFT to (0,6), I have only two moves next turn (UP and DOWN), while after DOWN to (1,5), I have three moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). So DOWN gives more flexibility.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is better.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (1,5), head at (1,5). Next turn, consider moving LEFT to (0,5) to eat the apple, but check if enemy is approaching (0,5). If safe, take it. Otherwise, go DOWN to (1,4) or RIGHT to (2,5) to avoid risk. Enemy is at (1,2) and may move towards (0,5) or (3,5), so be cautious.\n\nDOWN",

(so if I move here, I eat it and grow)\n- RIGHT: (2,5) \u2192 empty (from board: row5, x=2 is '.')\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Safety check:**\nEnemy snake #1 is at (1,3). It could move UP to (1,4) (empty), DOWN to (1,2) (its body), LEFT to (0,3) (empty), or RIGHT to (2,3) (empty). So it might move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. No immediate threat of collision this turn since we are 2 cells apart vertically.\n\n**Consequences:**\n- LEFT (0,5): eat apple! Then I grow: new head at (0,5), body becomes [current head (1,5) + current body without tail removal]. So new length 6. This gets me an apple and increases my lead.\n- DOWN (1,4): no apple, so move head to (1,4), tail (0,9) is removed. New body: head (1,4), then (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8). This moves me away from immediate apples but keeps me safe.\n- RIGHT (2,5): no apple, so head to (2,5), tail removed. New body: head (2,5), then (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8). This moves me towards (3,5) and (5,5).\n\n**Prioritizing apples:**\nThe apple at (0,5) is right next to me (LEFT). I should grab it immediately. This will give me 6 apples vs enemy's 4, extending my lead.\n\n**Risk assessment:**\nMoving LEFT to (0,5) is safe because:\n- It is not off-board.\n- It is not my body (my body is at (1,6), (1,7), etc. - no segment at (0,5)).\n- It is not enemy body (enemy body is at (1,2), (1,1), etc. - no enemy at (0,5)).\n- Enemy head is at (1,3) and cannot reach (0,5) this turn (it can only move to adjacent cells: (1,4), (1,2), (0,3), (2,3)). So no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is safe and gets an apple.\n\n**Future plan after eating (0,5):**\nAfter moving LEFT to (0,5) and eating, my new head is (0,5), and my body becomes [(0,5), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8)] (length 6). The apple at (0,5) is gone.\nNext turn, from (0,5), I can consider:\n- UP: (0,6) \u2192 empty? Currently (0,6) is empty (from board: row6, x=0 is '.'), but after I move, my body will be at (0,5) and (1,5), etc. So (0,6) should be safe.\n- DOWN: (0,4) \u2192 empty (row4, x=0 is '.').\n- LEFT: off-board (-1,5) \u2192 invalid.\n- RIGHT: (1,5) \u2192 my body (segment at (1,5)) \u2192 invalid.\nSo next turn, from (0,5), I have UP and DOWN as safe moves. This is acceptable.\n\nI should plan to move UP or DOWN next turn to avoid being trapped. UP (0,6) is good to explore more space. DOWN (0,4) is also safe.\n\nEnemy might be heading towards (3,5) or other apples. After I get (0,5), I can aim for (3,5) or (5,5) later.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLEFT is the best move because it immediately collects an apple and extends my lead. It is safe with no immediate threats.\n\nLEFT\n\n**Note for next turn:**\nAfter eating (0,5), head at (0,5). Next turn, move UP to (0,6) to avoid being stuck (only two moves: UP and DOWN). Then from (0,6), I can go RIGHT to (1,6) (if clear) or continue UP to (0,7). This will help me navigate towards other apples like (3,5) or (5,5). Enemy is at (1,3) and may be moving towards (3,5), so be cautious.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state after my last move:\n\n**Current position:**\n- My head: (0, 5)\n- My body: [(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9)]   [Note: I just ate the apple at (0,5), so I grew to length 7? Wait, let's check: I had 6 apples collected, and I just ate one, so now I have 7 apples. But my body length should be initial length (3) + apples collected (7) = 10 segments? Actually, in Snake, the body length is initial + apples eaten. Initially, snakes have length 3. So my snake should have 3 + 7 = 10 segments. But the state provided says my body has 6 segments? That doesn't add up. Let me recalc:\n\nFrom the game state:\n- My snake: head (0,5), body: [(1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9)] -> that's 6 body segments, plus head = 7 total. But I have collected 6 apples? Initial length is 3, so after 6 apples, I should be 3+6=9 segments. There's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, the state says: \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (0,5), Body: [(1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9)], Apples collected: 6\"\nSo total segments = head + body = 1 + 6 = 7. But with 6 apples collected, I should have initial 3 + 6 = 9. So there are 2 segments missing? Perhaps the state only lists the body without the head? Actually, the description says: \"Body: [list]\" which is the segments after the head. So total length = 1 (head) + len(body) = 1+6=7. But initial length is 3, so I should have grown by 6, meaning length 3+6=9. So there is an error.\n\nLooking back at the board state:\nRow 5: \"5 0 T . A . A . . . .\" -> at (0,5) is '0' (my head), and at (1,5) is 'T' (my tail/body). So indeed, my body includes (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9). That's 6 body segments.\n\nBut with 6 apples collected, I should have 3+6=9 segments. So why only 7? Perhaps the initial length is not 3? Or maybe the state is truncated? Actually, the board shows my head at (0,5) and body segments at (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9). That's 6, plus head=7. But I have 6 apples. This suggests that the initial length might be 1? Or there is a mistake.\n\nWait, let's read the rules: \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one, and the last tuple is the tail.\"\nSo the list provided for my snake is: Head: (0,5) and Body: [ (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9) ]. So the entire snake is: head (0,5), then (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9) as tail. That's 7 segments.\n\nBut with 6 apples collected, I should have grown 6 times from initial length. If initial length is 1, then 1+6=7, which matches. So perhaps the initial length is 1 in this game? That makes sense. So my snake has length 7.\n\nNow, after last move, I moved LEFT to (0,5) and ate the apple there. So now I have 7 apples collected, and my length is 8. But the state hasn't updated yet? Actually, this is the state after I moved: head at (0,5), and body now includes the old head (1,5) as the first body segment, and the tail didn't drop because I ate. So my new body should be: [ (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9) ] plus the new segment from growth? Actually, when you eat, you grow by adding a new segment at the tail end, but the tail doesn't move. So my body should now be 7 segments: the old body (6 segments) plus the new one? Wait, no: normally, when you eat, you move forward and the tail doesn't drop, so the length increases by one. So from length 7, after eating, I become length 8. But the state provided still shows body with 6 segments, which is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the state is before the growth? But it says \"Apples collected: 6\", and I just ate one, so it should be 7. This is confusing.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll trust the provided state: head at (0,5), body has 6 segments: (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9). So total length 7. And apples collected is 6. So I haven't grown yet? But I moved to (0,5) which had an apple. So the state might be after moving but before the apple is eaten and growth? Actually, the state is given for the start of turn 16.\n\nLet's look at the board: at (0,5) is '0' (my head), and there is no apple there now (since I ate it). So the apples list still has (0,5)? No, the apples list is: (5,5), (8,9), (8,8), (3,5), (9,4). So (0,5) is not there, meaning it was eaten.\n\nSo I did eat it, and I should have grown. But the body state hasn't updated to include the new segment? Perhaps the growth happens at the end of the turn, and the state is shown before growth? That might be it.\n\nFor safety, I should assume that my body is as given: head at (0,5), body at (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8), (0,9). So length 7.\n\nNow, for this turn (turn 16), I need to choose a move.\n\n**Valid moves from (0,5):**\n- UP: (0,6) -> check board: row6, x=0 is '.' (empty). Not my body? My body is at (1,5), (1,6), etc. (0,6) is not in my body list. So safe.\n- DOWN: (0,4) -> row4, x=0 is '.' (empty). Safe.\n- LEFT: (-1,5) -> off-board. Invalid.\n- RIGHT: (1,5) -> my body segment (first body segment). Invalid.\n\nSo only safe moves: UP and DOWN.\n\n**Enemy snake #1:** head at (2,3), body [(1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)]. It can move:\n- UP: (2,4) -> empty? Row4, x=2 is '.' -> safe.\n- DOWN: (2,2) -> empty? Row2, x=2 is '.' -> safe.\n- LEFT: (1,3) -> its own body -> invalid.\n- RIGHT: (3,3) -> empty? Row3, x=3 is '.' -> safe.\n\nSo enemy can move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. It is not near me (I'm at (0,5), enemy at (2,3)), so no immediate threat.\n\n**Apples available:** (5,5), (8,9), (8,8), (3,5), (9,4). The closest is (3,5), which is 3 cells away in x and same y. To reach it, I need to go RIGHT, but RIGHT is blocked by my body. So I must first move UP or DOWN to free up RIGHT.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI need to navigate towards the apples. Currently, I am against the left wall. Moving UP or DOWN will allow me to then turn RIGHT in future moves. For example, if I go UP to (0,6), then next turn I can go RIGHT to (1,6) (if clear) or continue UP. Similarly, if I go DOWN to (0,4), then RIGHT to (1,4).\n\nWhich is better? The apple at (3,5) is at y=5, so moving DOWN to (0,4) might be slightly better to get closer to y=5? Actually, (3,5) is at x=3,y=5. From (0,4), I need to go up as well. From (0,6), I need to go down. So similar.\n\nAlso, there is an apple at (5,5) which is further.\n\nI should avoid getting trapped. Currently, I have only two moves. After moving UP or DOWN, I will have more options.\n\n**Choose between UP and DOWN:**\nBoth are safe. Let's see which has better future options.\n\nIf I go UP to (0,6):\n- Next turn, from (0,6): can go UP to (0,7) (empty), DOWN to (0,5) (my body? But will it be there? After I move, my tail will move? Actually, since I didn't eat this turn, I will move and the tail will drop. So after moving UP to (0,6), my new head is (0,6), body becomes [ (0,5), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8) ] (tail (0,9) is dropped). So (0,5) becomes a body segment.\nThen from (0,6), moves:\n  - UP: (0,7) -> empty.\n  - DOWN: (0,5) -> my body -> invalid.\n  - LEFT: invalid.\n  - RIGHT: (1,6) -> currently, is it empty? In board, row6, x=1 is 'T' (my body). But after tail drop, (1,6) might become free? Actually, my new body will include (1,6) as a segment? Let's list new body: head (0,6), then (0,5), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8). So (1,6) is still a body segment. So RIGHT to (1,6) is invalid.\nSo only UP is safe from (0,6) next turn. That is risky.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0,4):\nAfter moving, head at (0,4), body becomes [ (0,5), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8) ] (tail (0,9) dropped).\nThen from (0,4), moves:\n  - UP: (0,5) -> my body -> invalid.\n  - DOWN: (0,3) -> empty.\n  - LEFT: invalid.\n  - RIGHT: (1,4) -> empty? Row4, x=1 is '.' -> safe.\nSo I would have two moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN gives me more options next turn (DOWN and RIGHT), while moving UP only gives UP.\n\nSo DOWN is better to avoid being trapped.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI should move DOWN to (0,4) to have more freedom next turn.\n\nDOWN\n\n**Note for next turn:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (0,4), head at (0,4), body: [ (0,5), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8) ]. Then I can move DOWN to (0,3) or RIGHT to (1,4). RIGHT is better to approach the apple at (3,5). So next turn, prefer RIGHT if safe.\n\nDOWN",

So it might move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. It is not an immediate threat to me.\n\n**Apples:**\nThe closest apple is (3,5) at distance |3-0| + |5-4| = 4. Moving RIGHT to (1,4) gets me closer to (3,5) (distance reduces to |3-1| + |5-4| = 3).

But enemy snake #1 has body at (1,3)? Actually, enemy body includes (1,3). So (1,3) is occupied by enemy body -> invalid (would die).\n  So only DOWN is safe from (0,3).\n\nThus, moving RIGHT gives more options (DOWN and RIGHT next turn), while moving DOWN only gives DOWN next turn and risks being trapped.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (1,4) to get closer to apples (especially (3,5) and (9,4)) and maintain flexibility.

(empty) in the board state (row 5, column 2 is shown as '.'). Also, not in any snake body? My body: no. Enemy body: no. Enemy head is at (3,5) which is not (2,5). So safe.\n- DOWN: (2,3) -> check board: row 3, column 2 is 'T' (which is my tail? Actually, my tail is at (1,7). But the board shows (2,3) as 'T'? In row 3: \"3 . T T T . . . . . .\" so column 2 is 'T' (which is (0,5), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) and (1,4) is just behind head. (2,3) is not in my body list. Actually, the 'T' at (2,3) is likely the enemy body? Enemy body has (2,3) as its fourth segment? Yes: enemy body is [(3,4), (3,3), (2,3), ...]. So (2,3) is occupied by enemy body -> invalid (would die).\n- LEFT: (1,4) -> occupied by my own body (first segment) -> invalid.\n- RIGHT: (3,4) -> check board: row 4, column 3 is 'T' (enemy body? Enemy body has (3,4) as first segment).

We checked and only UP is safe. So we must take it.\n\n**Next turn considerations:**\nIf we survive, from (2,5) we can go UP (2,6), DOWN (2,4) (our body? (2,4) is our head's current position, which will become body next turn), LEFT (1,5) (our body? (1,5) is in our body list), RIGHT (3,5) (enemy head currently, but might move). So we might have limited options. But we'll assess next turn.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nWe are forced UP to (2,5). If we survive, we need to avoid the enemy and aim for apples. The closest apple is (5,5) which is to the right. We should try to maneuver towards it while avoiding the enemy. Possibly go UP to (2,6) or RIGHT to (3,5) if enemy moves away.

They cannot reach (2,6) in one move. No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Future planning:**\nFrom (2,6), we have multiple safe moves. We should consider apple targeting and future flexibility.\n\nApples:\n- (7,7) is relatively close: path via RIGHT to (3,6), then (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), then UP to (7,7). But enemy might be going for (6,0) or (9,4) or (7,7) too.\n- (8,8) and (8,9) are far but achievable.\n- (9,4) is far and might be contested.\n- (6,0) is far and enemy might go for it.\n\nSince enemy has same apples (6), we need to grow. However, we should avoid risky paths.\n\nLEFT to (1,6) might lead to a dead end? Not immediately, but we have body segments around (0,4),(0,5),(1,4),(1,5). So (1,6) is adjacent to tail (1,5) but next turn tail will move if we don't eat? Currently no apple at (1,6), so if we move LEFT without eating, tail will shift and (1,5) becomes tail? Actually, after move without eating, tail moves: so body becomes [(2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,5)] and tail at (0,5). So (1,6) becomes free.\n\nRIGHT to (3,6) opens path to right side where apples are.\n\nUP to (2,7) is safe and gives more space.\n\n**Strategy note for future self:**\nWe are tied with enemy at 6 apples. We need to safely collect apples without getting trapped. The right side has multiple apples (7,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,4). Moving RIGHT seems promising to approach these. Also, enemy is at (5,5) and might go for (6,0) or (7,7). We should avoid head-on collisions and try to get to apples first. Keep options open.\n\nAmong safe moves, RIGHT moves us closer to the cluster of apples. UP also gives space but doesn't directly approach apples. LEFT moves away from apples and into a more congested area with our body.\n\nSo prefer RIGHT.\n\n**Final decision:**\nRIGHT",

Not in my body or enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, RIGHT.\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**\nEnemy head at (6,5). Their possible moves:\n- UP to (6,6): empty\n- DOWN to (6,4): empty\n- LEFT to (5,5): occupied by their own body \u2192 unsafe\n- RIGHT to (7,5): empty\n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nThey might go UP to (6,6) or DOWN to (6,4) or RIGHT to (7,5). They cannot reach (3,6) or (4,6) in one move. No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Apple targeting and strategy:**\nApples are mostly on the right side: (7,7), (8,8), (8,9), (9,4), and (6,0) is down. Moving RIGHT to (4,6) gets us closer to the cluster (7,7), (8,8), (8,9). UP to (3,7) is safe but doesn't progress much towards apples.\n\nWe should avoid moving towards enemy (who is at (6,5)) directly, but we can path around. Right now, enemy might go for (6,0) or (7,7). We can aim for (7,7) via (4,6) -> (5,6) -> (6,6) -> (7,6) then UP to (7,7). Alternatively, we could go UP to (3,7) and then right, but that is longer.\n\nAlso, note that our tail is at (0,5), so we have space behind. Moving RIGHT is preferable to get to apples faster.\n\n**Future planning:**\nWe are tied at 6 apples. We need to safely collect apples. The right side has multiple apples. Moving RIGHT positions us better. UP is safe but less productive. We should avoid getting trapped in the left where our body is.\n\n**Final decision:**\nRIGHT\n\n**Note to future self:**\nWe are moving right to approach apple cluster (7,7), (8,8), (8,9). Enemy is at (6,5) and might compete. Avoid head-on collisions. Consider pathing via (4,6)->(5,6)->(6,6) to (7,7). Also, watch for enemy moving to (6,6) or (7,5). If enemy goes for (6,0), we can secure the top-right apples. Keep options open.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n- **DOWN (5,6)**: This is my own neck/body segment. **NOT SAFE**.\n- **LEFT (4,7)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT (6,7)**: Empty. Safe.\n\nSo my safe moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Considering the enemy head at (7,7):**\nEnemy's possible moves from (7,7):\n- UP (7,8): Empty. Possible.\n- DOWN (7,6): This is the enemy's own neck/body segment. Not safe for them.\n- LEFT (6,7): Empty. Possible. This would directly compete with me if I go RIGHT.\n- RIGHT (8,7): Empty. Possible.\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,7) and the enemy goes LEFT to (6,7) on the same turn, we have a head-on collision and both die. This is a significant risk. To avoid immediate death, I should avoid (6,7) unless necessary.\n\n**Apple targeting:**\nApples are at: (8,9), (8,8), (9,4), (6,0), (7,8).\n- The closest apples are (8,9) and (8,8) in the top-right.\n- Apple (7,8) is particularly close\u2014only two moves away if I go UP then RIGHT. However, the enemy is also close to (7,8). If the enemy goes UP to (7,8), they get it first.\n\n**Strategy:**\nSince the enemy is slightly ahead (7 apples to my 6), I need to play safely and avoid direct confrontation. Going RIGHT risks a head-on collision. Going UP gives me more space and options toward the top-right apples while keeping distance from the enemy. Going LEFT moves me away from the main apple cluster but is safe.\n\n**Best choice:** UP. It's safe, progresses toward the high-value apple area, and avoids the head-on collision risk associated with RIGHT.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (5,8), reassess. Aim to swing right toward (8,8) or (8,9) if the enemy's position allows, but prioritize maintaining space and future mobility.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n- RIGHT (6,9): Empty. Safe.\n\nSo only safe moves are LEFT and RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy head at (8,8):**\nEnemy's possible moves:\n- UP (8,9): Contains an apple. Very likely.\n- DOWN (8,7): Empty.\n- LEFT (7,8): This is the enemy's own neck/body segment (first body segment is (7,8)). **NOT SAFE** for them.\n- RIGHT (9,8): Empty.\n\nSo enemy will likely go UP to (8,9) for the apple or possibly DOWN or RIGHT.\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,9), the enemy might go UP to (8,9) or other directions. No direct collision risk with enemy head this turn since enemy is at (8,8) and I'm at (5,9). However, if enemy goes UP to (8,9), that is far from me.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4,9), it is safe and moves me away from the enemy.\n\n**Apple targeting:**\nThe closest apple is at (8,9). Going RIGHT (to (6,9)) gets me closer to that apple. From (6,9), next turn I could go RIGHT to (7,9) and then to (8,9). However, the enemy is likely to take (8,9) this turn since it is adjacent to them. So I might not get it.\n\nThe other apples are at (9,4), (6,0), (6,4), (8,1). Going RIGHT puts me in a better position to eventually go down towards (6,4) or (9,4). Going LEFT moves me away from most apples.\n\n**Future options:**\nFrom (6,9):\n- Can go DOWN to (6,8) (empty), RIGHT to (7,9) (empty), or LEFT to (5,9) (but that would be my neck, so not safe next turn). So two safe moves likely.\nFrom (4,9):\n- Can go DOWN to (4,8) (empty), RIGHT to (5,9) (neck, not safe), LEFT to (3,9) (empty). So two safe moves.\n\nBoth have similar future options.\n\n**Strategy:**\nSince the enemy is likely to take (8,9) this turn, going RIGHT doesn't immediately get me an apple but positions me better for the next apples (like (9,4) or (6,4)). Going LEFT is safe but moves me away from the action. Given that the enemy has 9 apples (I have 6), I need to be aggressive to catch up.\n\nRIGHT is the better choice to stay competitive.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (6,9), assess the board. If enemy takes (8,9), consider moving DOWN towards (6,4) or RIGHT towards (9,4). Avoid getting trapped in the top row. The enemy's long body along the bottom might block some paths, but I can navigate.\n\nRIGHT",

Body: [(8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (3,4)].\n**Apples:** (9,4), (6,0), (6,4), (8,1), (6,7)\n\n**Potential moves from my head (6,9):**\n- UP (6,10): Off the board (y=10 invalid). **NOT SAFE**.\n- DOWN (6,8): Currently empty. But let's check for risks.\n- LEFT (5,9): This is my own body segment (neck). **NOT SAFE**.\n- RIGHT (7,9): Empty. Safe.\n\nSo only safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy head at (8,9):**\nEnemy's possible moves:\n- UP (8,10): Off the board. **NOT SAFE**.\n- DOWN (8,8): This is the enemy's own neck/body segment (first body segment is (8,8)). **NOT SAFE** for them.\n- LEFT (7,9): Empty.\n- RIGHT (9,9): Empty.\n\nSo enemy can only go LEFT to (7,9) or RIGHT to (9,9). Both are safe for them.\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**\nIf I go RIGHT to (7,9), that is one of the enemy's possible moves. If the enemy chooses LEFT to (7,9) at the same time, we would have a head-on collision and both die. Since the enemy has 10 apples and I have 6, this would be bad for me (they win). Therefore, going RIGHT is risky.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6,8), it is safe and avoids any potential head-on collision with the enemy.\n\n**Apple targeting:**\nThere is an apple at (6,7) which is adjacent to my body. From (6,8), going DOWN to (6,7) next turn would get me that apple. Also, (6,4) is another apple below. Going DOWN positions me to get these apples. Going RIGHT to (7,9) is risky and doesn't lead directly to an apple (closest is (9,4) or (8,1), but they are farther).\n\n**Future options:**\nFrom (6,8) [if I go DOWN]:\n- Can go DOWN to (6,7) (apple), RIGHT to (7,8) (empty), LEFT to (5,8) (empty). So multiple safe moves and an apple opportunity.\nFrom (7,9) [if I go RIGHT] - but this is risky due to potential head-on collision.\n\n**Strategy:**\nAvoid the head-on collision risk with the enemy. The enemy is forced to move to either (7,9) or (9,9). I should not go to (7,9) because there is a 50% chance the enemy goes there and kills us both. Instead, go DOWN to (6,8) which is safe and positions me for the apple at (6,7) next turn. This also moves me away from the top edge and towards other apples (like (6,4)).\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (6,8), go DOWN to (6,7) to eat the apple if still there. Then consider moving down further towards (6,4) or right towards (8,1). Avoid the enemy which is likely to be in the top right area. The enemy has a long body, so be cautious not to run into it.\n\nDOWN",

Wait \u2014 yes: tail advances next turn so previous head position (6, 7) might be body; actually, correction: this turn is the move after eating apple: so body length is currently 8 (including head), tail is still at (4,6). Movement this turn to (6,6) means body shifts: new head (6,6), next segment (6,7), then (6,8), (6,9)... so maybe next turn from (6,6) UP to (6,7) will be blocked by own body segment this turn\u2019s second segment (currently head (6,7) moves to (6,6), so segment behind head becomes (6,7) as new segment 2). So avoid going back there next turn. Need to plan paths to apples (6,4) or (8,1) without trapping myself.  \n\nFor now, only **DOWN** is safe anyway \u2014 so no choice.  \n\n**Final move:** DOWN  \n\nDOWN",

Both are far from my target (7,6), no immediate collision risk.\n\n**Growth status:**\nI just moved to (6,6) last turn (from previous head at (6,7)), and I had eaten an apple at (6,7) two turns ago? Actually, last rationale mentioned I ate apple at (6,7) last turn. But now my body length is 8 segments (head + 7 body parts), so I'm still in growth phase. This means when I move to (7,6), my tail won't advance - I'll grow to 9 segments.\n\n**Future planning:**\nAt (7,6), I need to plan to access apples. The closest are (6,4) and (8,1). I should avoid going north where my body is concentrated. From (7,6), next turn I could consider:\n- DOWN to (7,5): Currently enemy body at (7,5) but might move? Risky.\n- LEFT to (6,6): Will be empty? Actually, when I move to (7,6), my current head (6,6) becomes body segment, so (6,6) will be occupied.\n- RIGHT to (8,6): Empty.\n- UP to (7,7): Enemy body at (7,7) - risky.\n\nSo likely only DOWN or RIGHT might be safe next turn, but DOWN has enemy body at (7,5) which might move. I need to reassess next turn.\n\nFor now, only RIGHT is safe.\n\n**Final move:** RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",
