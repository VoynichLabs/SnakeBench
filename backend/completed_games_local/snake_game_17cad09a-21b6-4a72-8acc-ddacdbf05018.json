It is much closer to the apples at (3, 7), (2, 9), and (3, 5). \n\nConsidering my position at the bottom-right edge:\n- UP leads to (9, 3).\n- DOWN leads to (9, 1).\n- LEFT leads to (8, 2).\n- RIGHT leads to (10, 2) which is out of bounds.\n\nMoving LEFT is the most direct path toward any of the apples.

I will move LEFT to begin traversing across the bottom of the board.\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nMoving LEFT towards (4, 0).

          "rationale": "**START RATIONALE**\nMy head is at (4, 7). I need to move towards an apple. The closest apples are (3, 5) and (4, 0). The apple at (3, 5) requires moving Down twice and Left once. The apple at (4, 0) requires moving Down seven times.\n\nI must avoid the enemy snake #0 at (9, 2). Since it has no body, it can move anywhere next turn. It is currently far away (distance 9 horizontally, 2 vertically), so it is not an immediate threat.\n\nI will move DOWN to (4, 6) to head towards the apple at (3, 5) or (4, 0). Moving DOWN is safe because the cell (4, 6) is empty according to the board state. Moving UP to (4, 8) is also safe but moves me away from the apples. Moving LEFT to (3, 7) is blocked by an obstacle (as shown by the 'A' in the text description at (3, 7), though the map shows a dot? I will trust the map which shows (3, 7) as empty, but the text explicitly says \"Apples at: ... (3, 7)\". Wait, let me re-read the text. \"Apples at: (4, 0), (3, 7), (3, 5), (1, 4), (2, 9)\". The map shows (3, 7) as a dot. However, the map also shows (4, 0) as an 'A'. And (3, 5) as an 'A'. And (1, 4) as an 'A'. And (2, 9) as an 'A'. The map seems to contradict the list for (3, 7). But the map is the board state. Let's look at the map row 7: `7 . . . A 1 . . . . .`. This means (3, 7) is empty ('.'), (4, 7) is my head ('1'). The list says (3, 7) is an apple. This is a conflict. However, the list is usually the source of truth for apples, but the map is the board state. If the map says (3, 7) is empty, maybe the apple is not there? But the prompt says \"Apples at: ... (3, 7)\". I should probably trust the list. But the map shows (3, 7) as '.'.\n\nLet's look at the map again.\nRow 9: `9 . . A . . . . . . .` -> (2, 9) is A.\nRow 7: `7 . . . A 1 . . . . .` -> (3, 7) is A? No, (3, 7) is '.' (index 3). (4, 7) is '1'. The map representation might have indices starting at 0.\nLet's verify coordinates against the map.\nRow 7 (y=7): `7 . . . A 1 . . . . .`\nIndices 0-9.\nIndex 0: (0,7) = '.'\nIndex 1: (1,7) = '.'\nIndex 2: (2,7) = '.'\nIndex 3: (3,7) = 'A' (This is the 4th character).\nIndex 4: (4,7) = '1'.\nSo the map DOES show an 'A' at (3, 7). My bad. It is an apple.\n\nSo, targets:\n1. (3, 7): Left. Distance 1.\n2. (3, 5): Down 2, Left 1. Distance 3.\n3. (4, 0): Down 7. Distance 7.\n\nThe apple at (3, 7) is right next to me.\nLeft to (3, 7).\nIs this safe?\nMy current body: None.\nEnemy: (9, 2).\nEnemy potential moves: Any.\nMy potential moves after moving Left: (3, 7) (if I eat apple, I grow, tail stays at (4,7) next turn? No, I grow 1. If I eat, I don't remove tail).\nIf I don't eat, I move tail.\nIf I eat, tail stays.\nIf I move Left to (3, 7), is there any danger?\nThe enemy is far. (3, 7) is empty on the map (wait, it's an 'A', meaning apple. Apples are safe to move onto).\nSo moving LEFT is safe.\n\nHowever, I need to consider the \"Long-term plan\".\nIf I move LEFT, I eat the apple at (3, 7). My head becomes (3, 7). My body becomes (4, 7).\nNext turn, I am at (3, 7). I can go to (3, 6) (Down) or (2, 7) (Left) or (3, 8) (Up) or (4, 7) (Right - which is backwards into my body, so death).\nSo I will have 3 options.\nFrom (3, 7), the other apples are (3, 5) (Down 2) and (4, 0) (Down 7, Right 1).\nMoving LEFT seems good.\n\nLet's check other options.\nUP to (4, 8): Safe. No apple. Moves away from apples.\nDOWN to (4, 6): Safe. No apple. Closer to (3, 5) and (4, 0).\nRIGHT to (5, 7): Safe. No apple. Moves towards empty space.\n\nIf I move DOWN, I don't get an apple immediately, but I position myself to get (3, 5) or (4, 0).\n(3, 5) is at (3, 5). From (4, 6): Left -> (3, 6), Down -> (3, 5). 2 moves.\n(4, 0) is at (4, 0). From (4, 6): Down x 6.\n\nThe difference between moving LEFT and DOWN is immediate score vs positioning.\nSince I am at turn 0/150, scoring early is good to get size and potentially reach 50 faster.\nAlso, eating the apple removes it from the board, potentially blocking the enemy or just securing points.\nThe apple at (3, 7) is close.\nI will take the apple at (3, 7).\nWait, let me check if (3, 7) is a trap.\nFrom (3, 7), I can go to (3, 6) or (2, 7) or (3, 8).\n(3, 6) is empty (Row 6: `6 . . . . . . . . . .` -> (3,6) is '.').\n(2, 7) is empty (Row 7: `7 . . . A 1 . . . . .` -> (2,7) is '.').\n(3, 8) is empty (Row 8: `8 . . . . . . . . . .` -> (3,8) is '.').\nSo plenty of space.\n\nIs there a risk of head-on collision?\nThe enemy is at (9, 2). Distance is huge. No risk.\n\nSo, LEFT is a safe move that gets me an apple immediately.\nIs there any reason not to?\nMaybe if the enemy rushes me? Unlikely.\nMaybe if I want to go for a bigger apple?\n(3, 5) is also close. (3, 7) is closer.\n(4, 0) is far.\n\nI will go LEFT.\n\nWait, I should double check the board state mapping one more time.\nRow 7: `7 . . . A 1 . . . . .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nValues: (0,7) ., (1,7) ., (2,7) ., (3,7) A, (4,7) 1.\nSo (3,7) is definitely an apple.\n\nFinal check on safety.\nMoving to (3, 7).\nMy body is currently empty. So no self collision.\nEnemy body is empty.\nOff board? No.\nSo LEFT is safe.\n\nI will write a plan.\nPlan: Eat the apple at (3, 7) to grow. Then move towards (3, 5) or (4, 0).\n\nWait, I need to make sure I don't mention future directions in the final output. The prompt says: \"Do not mention future directions after it.\" The plan is separate.\n\nThe prompt says: \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nAnd \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo I will write the plan, then the move.\n\nLet's consider if the enemy can kill me.\nEnemy at (9, 2).\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 7).\nIf enemy moves to... well, they can't reach me in 1 turn.\nSo I am safe.\n\nLet's consider the \"multi-apple\" aspect. There are multiple apples. I am prioritizing the closest one.\n\nOne check on (3, 7). Is it possible that the apple is NOT there?\nThe list says yes. The map says yes (based on my analysis of the ASCII).\nWait, the ASCII I wrote in my thought process:\n`7 . . . A 1 . . . . .`\nIt is `A` in the list.\nYes.\n\nOkay, I am confident in LEFT.\n\nWait, is there any trap?\nRow 7: `7 . . . A 1 . . . . .`\nIf I go LEFT to (3, 7), I become the head at (3, 7).\nThe cell to my left is (2, 7) which is empty.\nThe cell to my down is (3, 6) which is empty.\nThe cell to my up is (3, 8) which is empty.\nThe cell to my right is (4, 7) which will be my body.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (4, 6):\n(4, 6) is empty.\nNext moves: (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 6), (4, 7) (backwards).\n(3, 6) is empty.\n(4, 5) is empty (Row 5: `5 . . . A . . . . . .` -> (4,5) is '.').\n(5, 6) is empty.\nSo DOWN is also safe.\n\nWhy LEFT over DOWN?\nLEFT gives me an apple *now*. This increases my score immediately.\nIn Snake, getting points early is usually beneficial.\nAlso, (3, 7) is \"closer\" in terms of turn count (1 turn vs 1 turn to (4,6), but (4,6) doesn't give points).\nSo LEFT > DOWN.\n\nWhy not UP or RIGHT?\nUP moves away from apples.\nRIGHT moves away from apples.\n\nSo, LEFT is the best move.\n\nOne final check on the enemy.\nEnemy at (9, 2). Apple at (4, 0).\nDistance enemy to (4, 0): |9-4| + |2-0| = 5 + 2 = 7.\nDistance me to (4, 0): |4-4| + |7-0| = 0 + 7 = 7.\nWe can both reach (4, 0) at roughly the same time if we both rush it.\nBut I am going LEFT first (to (3, 7)).\nThis puts me near (3, 5) and (3, 7).\nThe enemy is far away.\n\nI will proceed with LEFT.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nI am at (4, 7). The closest apple is at (3, 7), one cell to my left. Moving LEFT allows me to eat this apple immediately, securing 1 point and growing my snake. This move is safe as I have no body to collide with, the destination is within the board, and the enemy snake is too far away to threaten me this turn. Moving DOWN would position me closer to other apples but delays scoring. Moving UP or RIGHT moves me away from apples.\n\nPlan: Eat the apple at (3, 7). Next turn, navigate towards the cluster of apples at (3, 5) or the one at (4, 0), while keeping distance from enemy snake #0.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

The snake body currently occupies the cells (1, 5), (2, 5), and (2, 6). The move `DOWN` in the previous turn was a mistake as I was already at (1, 4) (confirmed by the board state where my head `1` is at y=4) and moved... nowhere? Wait, the prompt says \"Your last move information: ... DOWN\". The board state shows my head at `(1, 4)`. If I moved DOWN from the previous head position, I would have moved from `(1, 5)` to `(1, 4)`. However, the board state shows an apple at `(1, 5)` in the previous turn (based on the \"Apples so far\" list). The prompt logic is slightly confusing, but the current board state is the absolute truth.\n\nCurrent Board State (Turn 6):\n- My Head: `(1, 4)`\n- My Body: `[(1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6)]`\n- Apples: `(4, 0), (3, 5), (2, 9), (7, 8), (9, 2)` (No apple at `(1, 5)` because I presumably just ate it to be at `(1, 4)`).\n\nWait, if I ate the apple at `(1, 5)` in the last turn, I would have grown. The body list `[(1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6)]` suggests the old tail at `(2, 6)` is still there (since we haven't moved `T` off the board yet).\n\nLet's check the directions from `(1, 4)`:\n1.  **UP (1, 5):** This is currently occupied by my own body (the segment that was my neck). If I just moved DOWN to `(1, 4)` (which seems implied by the \"Last Move\" info, though that contradicts the board state showing a body segment there), I cannot move UP into my neck.\n2.  **DOWN (1, 3):** Empty on board `.`. Safe.\n3.  **LEFT (0, 4):** Empty on board `.`. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (2, 4):** Empty on board `.`. Safe.\n\nWait, re-evaluating the \"Last Move\":\nThe prompt says \"Your last move information: DOWN\".\nBut the Board State shows my head at `(1, 4)` and `Apples at: (4, 0), (3, 5), (2, 9), (7, 8), (9, 2)`.\nThere is **no apple at (1, 5)** in the current list.\nThis implies I ate the apple at `(1, 5)` in the previous turn and moved to `(1, 4)`. This is consistent.\nHowever, if I am at `(1, 4)` and my body is at `(1, 5)`, moving UP would be suicide (hitting my own body).\n\nLet's look for the nearest apple:\n- `(4, 0)`: Distance `|1-4| + |4-0| = 3 + 4 = 7`\n- `(3, 5)`: Distance `|1-3| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3`\n- `(2, 9)`: Distance `|1-2| + |4-9| = 1 + 5 = 6`\n- `(7, 8)`: Distance `|1-7| + |4-8| = 6 + 4 = 10`\n- `(9, 2)`: Distance `|1-9| + |4-2| = 8 + 2 = 10`\n\nThe closest apple is at `(3, 5)`.\nTo get to `(3, 5)` from `(1, 4)`, I need to go RIGHT and UP.\nMy current options: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\nRIGHT moves me closer to `(3, 5)`.\nDOWN moves me towards `(4, 0)` (distance increases to 8).\nLEFT moves me away from `(3, 5)` (distance increases to 4).\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is the optimal move to approach the nearest apple at `(3, 5)`.\n\n**Plan:**\nHead towards the apple at `(3, 5)`.\n\nRIGHT",

My body is `[(3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4)]`.\nI did not eat an apple on the last move (to `(3, 6)`), so my tail will move forward this turn. This means that `[(3, 5), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4)]` will shift, and the cell currently at `(1, 4)` will become empty (unless I eat an apple this turn).\n\nI need to check the safety of moving in each direction.\n\n**Potential Moves:**\n1.  **UP (3, 7):** The board state shows `.`. This is an empty cell.\n2.  **DOWN (3, 5):** The board state shows `1`. This is my body. However, because my tail is moving (I didn't eat last turn), the cell `(3, 5)` (which is my current neck) will move to `(3, 6)` (my new head position). Wait, actually, the neck moves to where the head is, the body moves to where the neck was, etc.\n    *   Let's trace the tail movement: My tail is currently at `(1, 4)`. It moves to `(2, 4)`.\n    *   The segment at `(2, 4)` moves to `(3, 4)`.\n    *   The segment at `(3, 4)` moves to `(3, 5)`.\n    *   The segment at `(3, 5)` moves to `(3, 6)`.\n    *   My head moves to a new position.\n    *   If I move **DOWN** to `(3, 5)`, I would be moving into the cell that the segment at `(3, 4)` is moving into. That is a collision. So **DOWN is fatal**.\n3.  **LEFT (2, 6):** The board state shows `.`. This is an empty cell.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 6):** The board state shows `.`. This is an empty cell.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n*   **Safety:** Moving DOWN is fatal. I must choose between UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n*   **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at `(6, 1)`. It is far away on the bottom right. It is unlikely to threaten me immediately, but I should generally avoid the bottom right to maintain distance.\n*   **Apples:**\n    *   Top-left: `(2, 9)` and `(7, 8)`.\n    *   Bottom-right: `(9, 2)`, `(9, 5)`.\n*   **Plan:**\n    *   Moving **UP** to `(3, 7)` is a safe, central move. It moves me towards the top apples `(2, 9)` and `(7, 8)`. This seems like the best long-term direction.\n    *   Moving **LEFT** to `(2, 6)` moves me towards the wall and the top-left corner. It is safe, but \"Up\" feels more flexible.\n    *   Moving **RIGHT** to `(4, 6)` moves me somewhat towards the middle, but also towards the bottom-right apples which are in contested territory. \"Up\" is safer and better for the top-left apples.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **UP** to `(3, 7)` is safe. It is the most direct path towards the apples in the top-left quadrant `(2, 9)` and `(7, 8)`. It maintains central board control and avoids the wall.

This is a valid and beneficial move.\n4.  **RIGHT (4, 9):** The board shows `.` (empty) at this coordinate.

Still far.\n        *   The enemy has 2 apples.\n        \n    *   Plan:\n        Move DOWN to (2, 8).\n        Then next turn, I can likely move RIGHT (to 3, 8) or DOWN (to 2, 7).\n        The body will be at (3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 7)... wait, if I move DOWN, the new body will be: Head (2, 8), Old Head (2, 9), then Old Body... but wait.\n        Current: Head (2, 9). Body [ (3, 9), (3, 8), ... ].\n        If I move DOWN:\n            New Head: (2, 8).\n            New Body: [ (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), ... ].\n            The tail (3, 5) moves to (3, 6).\n            \n        Next turn options from (2, 8):\n            UP: (2, 9). This is now part of my body (specifically, the segment behind head). **DEATH**.\n            DOWN: (2, 7). Empty? Board row 7: \". . . T . . . A . .\". Index 2 is '.'.\n            LEFT: (1, 8). Empty? Row 8: \". . . T . A . A . .\". Index 1 is '.'.\n            RIGHT: (3, 8). Is this free? My new body will be [ (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), ... ].\n                So (3, 8) is the 3rd segment of my body. It is occupied. **DEATH**.\n                \n        So, if I move DOWN now, next turn I cannot go UP (backwards) or RIGHT (into body).\n        I can only go DOWN or LEFT.\n        This is a bit constrained.\n        \n        Let's look at (2, 8) again.\n        If I go DOWN now to (2, 8).\n        Next turn:\n            DOWN -> (2, 7). Safe.\n            LEFT -> (1, 8). Safe.\n            UP -> (2, 9). Body. Death.\n            RIGHT -> (3, 8). Body. Death.\n            \n        If I go LEFT now to (1, 9).\n        Next turn:\n            Head (1, 9).\n            Body: [ (2, 9), (3, 9), ... ].\n            Moves:\n                UP: (1, 10).

Death.\n                \n        So from (1, 9) I have 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, UP is wall).\n        From (2, 8) I have 2 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT).\n        \n        However, (2, 8) is closer to the apples at Y=8.\n        \n        Let's re-evaluate the \"blocked\" moves from (2, 8).\n        The body is [ (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), ... ].\n        Right is (3, 8). That is indeed in the body list.\n        Up is (2, 9). That is indeed in the body list.\n        \n        So from (2, 8), I am forced to go DOWN or LEFT.\n        \n        If I go DOWN to (2, 7).\n        Next turn (from 2, 7):\n            Body: [ (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), ... ].\n            UP: (2, 8) -> Body. Death.\n            DOWN: (2, 6). Safe?\n            LEFT: (1, 7). Safe?\n            RIGHT: (3, 7). My body is (3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 7), ... (original body).\n            Wait, original body was (3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5).\n            So (3, 7) is part of the original body.\n            So RIGHT is Death.\n            \n        So I am stuck moving DOWN or LEFT for a while. This is a \"corridor\".\n        \n        Let's check the board for row 7, 6, 5.\n        Row 7: \". . . T . . . A . .\"\n        Row 6: \". . . T . A . . . .\"\n        Row 5: \". . . T . . . . . A\"\n        \n        If I go DOWN to (2, 8) -> (2, 7) -> (2, 6) -> (2, 5)...\n        I am running down the left edge.\n        \n        The apples are at:\n        (5, 8)\n        (7, 8)\n        (5, 6)\n        (7, 7)\n        (9, 5)\n        \n        To get these, I eventually need to turn RIGHT.\n        But I am blocked by my own body on the column x=3.\n        \n        Wait, my body is at x=3.\n        If I move DOWN repeatedly, my body stretches vertically at x=3 and x=2 (the new tail).\n        The tail is at (3, 5) initially. As I move down, the tail moves.\n        \n        Let's look at the grid layout.\n        My body forms a wall at x=3 from y=5 to y=9.\n        If I move down from (2, 9) to (2, 8), the new body segment is (2, 9).\n        If I move down to (2, 7), the new body segment is (2, 8).\n        So I am building a wall at x=2.\n        \n        To turn RIGHT, I need to reach a point where (3, y) is NOT in my body.\n        Currently my body is at (3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5).\n        If I move down 5 times, I will be at (2, 4).\n        My body will be:\n        (2, 4) [Head]\n        (2, 5)\n        (2, 6)\n        (2, 7)\n        (2, 8)\n        (2, 9)\n        (3, 9)\n        (3, 8)\n        (3, 7)\n        (3, 6)\n        (3, 5) [Tail]\n        \n        Wait, the body list is limited to length 6 (Head + 5 body segments).\n        So if I eat 0 apples, length is 6.\n        Head + 5 body.\n        Initial: H(2, 9), B(3, 9), B(3, 8), B(3, 7), B(3, 6), B(3, 5). Length 6.\n        \n        If I move DOWN 1 (Turn 15):\n        H(2, 8), B(2, 9), B(3, 9), B(3, 8), B(3, 7), B(3, 6). (Tail (3, 5) gone).\n        \n        If I move DOWN 2 (Turn 16):\n        H(2, 7), B(2, 8), B(2, 9), B(3, 9), B(3, 8), B(3, 7).\n        \n        If I move DOWN 3 (Turn 17):\n        H(2, 6), B(2, 7), B(2, 8), B(2, 9), B(3, 9), B(3, 8).\n        \n        If I move DOWN 4 (Turn 18):\n        H(2, 5), B(2, 6), B(2, 7), B(2, 8), B(2, 9), B(3, 9).\n        \n        If I move DOWN 5 (Turn 19):\n        H(2, 4), B(2, 5), B(2, 6), B(2, 7), B(2, 8), B(2, 9).\n        \n        At Turn 19 (Head at 2, 4), my body is strictly at x=2. The x=3 column is now clear of my body (except maybe the very old tail, but it's gone).\n        So at (2, 4), I can move RIGHT to (3, 4).\n        \n        Where are the apples?\n        (5, 6), (5, 8), (7, 7), (7, 8), (9, 5).\n        \n        To get to (5, 6), I need to go to Y=6. Currently Y=9. I need to go down.\n        If I go down to (2, 4), I am at Y=4.\n        Then I can go RIGHT to (3, 4), then UP to (3, 5)...\n        \n        But wait, (3, 5) is the original tail location.\n        \n        Let's look at the apples again.\n        (5, 8) is at Y=8. I am at Y=9. I should go there.\n        But I am blocked by my body at x=3.\n        If I go DOWN, I am moving away from Y=8.\n        \n        Is there a way to get to (5, 8)?\n        Current: (2, 9). Target: (5, 8).\n        Direct path: Right, Right, Down.\n        Step 1: Right to (3, 9). Blocked by body.\n        Step 1: Down to (2, 8). Valid.\n        From (2, 8): Right to (3, 8). Blocked by body (segment at 3, 8).\n        From (2, 8): Down to (2, 7). Valid.\n        From (2, 7): Right to (3, 7). Blocked (body at 3, 7).\n        ...\n        So I cannot go right until I have \"shed\" the body segments at x=3.\n        The body segments at x=3 are (3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5).\n        To shed (3, 9), I must move 1 step.\n        To shed (3, 8), I must move 2 steps.\n        To shed (3, 7), 3 steps.\n        To shed (3, 6), 4 steps.\n        To shed (3, 5), 5 steps.\n        \n        So I must make 5 moves before I can safely enter column 3 again (from column 2).\n        5 moves down takes me to (2, 4).\n        At (2, 4), I can move RIGHT to (3, 4).\n        \n        Now, at (3, 4), my body is [ (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9) ]? No, wait.\n        Length is 6.\n        After 5 moves down:\n        Head (2, 4).\n        Body: [ (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9) ].\n        This looks like a vertical line at x=2.\n        \n        So moving RIGHT to (3, 4) is safe.\n        Now I am at (3, 4).\n        Where are the apples?\n        (5, 6): x=5, y=6. (3, 4) -> (5, 6). dx=2, dy=2.\n        (5, 8): x=5, y=8. dx=2, dy=4.\n        \n        I need to go UP and RIGHT.\n        \n        Is there any other path?\n        What if I go LEFT?\n        (2, 9) -> (1, 9).\n        From (1, 9), I can go DOWN to (1, 8).\n        From (1, 8), I can go DOWN to (1, 7).\n        I can keep going down to (1, 0).\n        Then I can go RIGHT along the bottom.\n        Then I can go UP along the right edge.\n        But the apples are at x=5, 7, 9 and y=5, 6, 7, 8.\n        \n        Let's compare:\n        Path A (Down then Right): (2,9)->(2,8)->(2,7)->(2,6)->(2,5)->(2,4)->(3,4)->...\n        Path B (Left then Down): (2,9)->(1,9)->(1,8)->(1,7)->...->(1,0)->(2,0)->(3,0)->(4,0)->(5,0)->(6,0)->(7,0)->(8,0)->(9,0)->(9,1)->(9,2)...\n        \n        Wait, (9, 2) is the enemy snake head.\n        The enemy is at (9, 2). Body: [(8, 2), (7, 2)].\n        The board at row 2: \" . . . . . . . . T T 0 \".\n        So (9, 2) is 0 (Head). (8, 2) is T. (7, 2) is T.\n        \n        If I go down the left side (Path B), I avoid the enemy.\n        But Path A is much faster to the apples.\n        \n        Apples at:\n        (5, 6)\n        (5, 8)\n        (7, 7)\n        (7, 8)\n        (9, 5)\n        \n        Path A gets me to x=3 by turn ~19.\n        Then I can go UP to y=6 (turn 22).\n        Then RIGHT to x=5 (turn 24).\n        That's ~10 turns to get an apple.\n        \n        Path B: Going all the way around.\n        (2, 9) -> (1, 9) -> ... -> (1, 0) [9 moves]\n        -> (9, 0) [8 moves]\n        -> (9, 5) [5 moves]\n        Total ~22 turns.\n        \n        Path A is much better.\n        \n        So I must commit to moving DOWN.\n        \n        Let's verify the \"Death\" moves again.\n        UP: (2, 10) -> Wall. Death.\n        RIGHT: (3, 9) -> Body. Death.\n        DOWN: (2, 8) -> Empty. Safe.\n        LEFT: (1, 9) -> Empty. Safe.\n        \n        Is there any reason to prefer LEFT over DOWN?\n        If I go LEFT, I have more space to turn (since I'm not against the x=3 wall).\n        But I am already against the x=2 wall? No, x=2 is empty space to the left.\n        But going LEFT delays reaching the apples.\n        \n        The only danger in moving DOWN is getting trapped if I can't eventually turn right.\n        But we established I can turn right at (2, 4).\n        The board at (2, 4) is '.'.\n        The board at (3, 4) is '.'.\n        The board at (3, 5) is originally a body part, but by the time I get to (3, 4), (3, 5) will be empty.\n        \n        So DOWN is the optimal move.\n        \n        However, let's check the \"Last Rationale\" again. It claimed it moved LEFT into an apple.\n        It hallucinated an apple at (2, 9).\n        I am at (2, 9). There is NO apple.\n        The apples are listed explicitly: (7, 8), (5, 8), (9, 5), (5, 6), (7, 7).\n        \n        So the LLM assistant in the prompt made a mistake.\n        I must ignore that logic.\n        \n        My turn 14.\n        Head (2, 9).\n        Move DOWN to (2, 8).\n        \n        Wait, I should double check the board again.\n        Row 8: \". . . T . A . A . .\"\n        Index 2 (column 2) is empty.\n        \n        Is there any interaction with the enemy?\n        Enemy head (9, 2).\n        Enemy body (8, 2), (7, 2).\n        Enemy moves one step.\n        If enemy moves UP, to (9, 3).\n        If enemy moves LEFT, to (8, 2). But (8, 2) is its own body.\n        If enemy moves DOWN, to (9, 1).\n        If enemy moves RIGHT, to (10, 2) -> Wall.\n        \n        So the enemy is trapped or must move UP or DOWN.\n        It is far from me.\n        \n        So I am safe to move DOWN.\n        \n        Plan:\n        Move DOWN repeatedly until (2, 4).\n        Then move RIGHT to (3, 4).\n        Then navigate to the apples.\n        \n        I will write the move DOWN.\n        \n        One final check:\n        Is there any snake at (2, 8)?\n        Board shows \".\"\n        \n        Is there any snake at (2, 9)?\n        Board shows \"1\" (Me).\n        \n        Is there any snake at (3, 9)?\n        Board shows \"T\" (Me).\n        \n        So (2, 9) -> (2, 8) is valid.\n        \n        The \"Last Rationale\" mentioned moving LEFT because of an apple at (2, 9).\n        There is no apple.\n        So that rationale is wrong.\n        I should stick to my plan.\n        \n        Move: DOWN.\n        \n        Wait, I should consider if the enemy might move to (2, 8)?\n        Enemy is at (9, 2). It needs 7 steps to reach (2, 8). Impossible.\n        \n        So DOWN is safe.\n        \n        Wait, I should check if I am being too cautious.\n        The previous assistant moved LEFT.\n        Why?\n        Maybe it saw something I missed?\n        Or maybe it's just a bad hallucination.\n        \"Moving here would place my head at (2, 9), which is actually an apple!\"\n        \"Moving here... would place my head at (2, 9)\"\n        Wait, moving LEFT from (3, 9) places head at (2, 9).\n        The prompt says \"My current head is at (3, 9)\". (This is the start of the prompt).\n        So the previous move was LEFT from (3, 9) to (2, 9).\n        And the previous rationale claimed there was an apple at (2, 9).\n        There isn't.\n        So the previous turn's move was based on a hallucination.\n        Now I am at (2, 9). I have to decide the next move.\n        \n        Should I follow the wall?\n        (2, 9) -> (2, 8).\n        \n        Let's look at the coordinates of apples.\n        (5, 8) is at y=8.\n        If I go to (2, 8), I am on the same y-level as the closest apple (5, 8).\n        Distance is 3 squares to the right.\n        But I am blocked by my body at (3, 8).\n        My body is at (3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5).\n        To free up (3, 8), I need to move 2 times (so that (3, 8) is the tail and gets removed).\n        If I move DOWN to (2, 8) [1 move], body becomes [ (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), ... ].\n        If I move DOWN to (2, 7) [2 moves], body becomes [ (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), ... ].\n        At this point (after 2 moves), (3, 8) is still in the body list?\n        Let's trace length 6.\n        Start: (2,9) H, (3,9) B1, (3,8) B2, (3,7) B3, (3,6) B4, (3,5) B5.\n        Move 1 (DOWN): (2,8) H, (2,9) B1, (3,9) B2, (3,8) B3, (3,7) B4, (3,6) B5. (Tail (3,5) gone).\n        Move 2 (DOWN): (2,7) H, (2,8) B1, (2,9) B2, (3,9) B3, (3,8) B4, (3,7) B5.\n        Move 3 (DOWN): (2,6) H, (2,7) B1, (2,8) B2, (2,9) B3, (3,9) B4, (3,8) B5.\n        Move 4 (DOWN): (2,5) H, (2,6) B1, (2,7) B2, (2,8) B3, (2,9) B4, (3,9) B5.\n        Move 5 (DOWN): (2,4) H, (2,5) B1, (2,6) B2, (2,7) B3, (2,8) B4, (2,9) B5.\n        \n        At Move 5 (Head at 2,4), the body is at y=5,6,7,8,9.\n        Column 3 is free.\n        So I can move RIGHT to (3, 4).\n        \n        This confirms the 5-move plan.\n        The first move of this plan is DOWN.\n        \n        Is there any reason to wait?\n        No, apples are further down (y=8, 6, etc).\n        If I stay at (2, 9), I am moving away from apples (except maybe the ones at y=8, but I can't reach them yet).\n        So moving DOWN is correct.\n        \n        Final check on safety:\n        (2, 8) is empty.\n        Enemy is far.\n        \n        I will output DOWN.\n\n        One detail: the prompt says \"Turn: 14 / 150\".\n        I have plenty of time.\n        \n        The prompt says \"All snakes move simultaneously\".\n        I must consider if the enemy can block me. Unlikely.\n        \n        So the decision is DOWN.\n        \n        (Wait, is there any trap I'm missing? The board seems open in the bottom left.)\n        \n        Board:\n        9: . . 1 T . . . . . .\n        8: . . . T . A . A . .\n        ...\n        At (2, 8), it's empty.\n        \n        It seems correct.\n        \n        I will write the plan in the \"think out loud\" section.\n        The plan is: \"Move down to (2, 8). My current body blocks the right path to the apples. I need to move down 5 times to clear the column to my right (x=3). Then I can turn right to (3, 4) and head towards the apples at (5, 6) and (5, 8).\"\n        \n        Wait, the prompt asks me to put the plan \"before your final move line\".\n        \n        So:\n        <Plan>\n        Move DOWN to (2, 8). My body currently blocks the path to the apples at x=3. I need to move down 5 times to clear the column to my right. Then I can turn right and head towards the apples at (5, 6) and (5, 8).\n        </Plan>\n        DOWN\n        \n        Actually, I should keep it brief as requested (\"short long-term plan\").\n        \"Move down to clear the path to the right. I am currently blocked by my own body at x=3. Plan to move down 5 times, then turn right.\"\n        \n        Let's refine the text.\n        \n        \"My head is at (2, 9). My body is at x=3, blocking the rightward path. I must move DOWN to (2, 8) to begin clearing the path. Long term: Move down 5 turns, turn right to (3, 4), then head to apples.\"\n        \n        This seems good.\n        \n        One last check. Is (2, 8) really the best move?\n        What about (1, 9)?\n        (1, 9) -> (1, 8).\n        (1, 8) -> (1, 7).\n        This keeps me close to the wall.\n        But I have to walk all the way around.\n        The apples at (5, 8) are closer via the \"down and right\" route, provided I can clear the path.\n        Given my length is 6, I can clear the path in 5 moves.\n        So yes, DOWN is better.\n        \n        Also, the prompt says \"My current head is at (2, 9)\". This is the input state.\n        \n        I will output DOWN.\n\n        The prompt asks for \"short long-term plan or strategy note\".\n        I will write:\n        \"Strategy: Move DOWN to (2, 8). My body at x=3 blocks the path to apples. I will move down for 5 turns to clear the column, then turn right towards the apples at (5, 6) and (5, 8).\"\n\n        Wait, the prompt says \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n        And \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\n        \n        So the structure is:\n        [Output text]\n        MOVE\n        \n        I will output the text and then the move.\n\n        Let's write the text.\n        \n        \"My head is at (2, 9).

I plan to move down 5 times, then turn right to reach the apples.\"\n\n        No, I need to be careful about the \"think out loud\" part. I can just write the plan.\n        \n        \"Long term plan: Move DOWN to start clearing the path to the right. My body is blocking the column at x=3. I will move down for several turns, then turn right to reach the apples at (5, 8) and (5, 6).\"\n\n        Let's go with that.\n\n        The move is DOWN.\n\n        Wait, I must ensure I don't mention future directions *after* the final move line.\n        \"Do not mention future directions after it.\"\n        So I should not say \"I will move down\" and then \"DOWN\"?\n        No, it says \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n        So the plan comes first, then the move line.\n        \n        Example:\n        \"My plan is to go down. DOWN\"\n        This violates \"Do not mention future directions after it\" if \"go down\" is considered a mention.\n        But \"go down\" is in the plan.\n        The rule is \"Do not mention future directions after it\".\n        \"It\" refers to the final move line.\n        So I should not have text *after* \"DOWN\".\n        \n        I will write the plan, then a newline, then \"DOWN\".\n        \n        Plan text:\n        \"I am at (2, 9). Moving DOWN to (2, 8) begins clearing the path to the right, which is blocked by my body. I will move down for 5 turns to free up column 3, then head towards the apples at (5, 6) and (5, 8).\"\n\n        This looks fine.\n\n        One final check: Is there any danger from the enemy?\n        Enemy at (9, 2).\n        If I am at (2, 8), I am safe.\n        The game is 150 turns. I have 136 turns left.\n        \n        Final decision: DOWN.\n        \n        Wait, I should consider if I can eat an apple immediately.\n        Is there an apple at (2, 8)? No.\n        Is there an apple at (1, 9)? No.\n        So no immediate benefit.\n        \n        Is there an apple at (2, 5)? No.\n        \n        So I am just positioning.\n        \n        Is there a better positioning move?\n        (1, 9) allows me to potentially go to (0, 9) then down.\n        But (2, 9) is \"central\" in the sense that I can go left or down.\n        Going down is better because it leads to the apples.\n        \n        Okay, confident in DOWN.\n        \n        Text:\n        \"Moving DOWN to (2, 8). My body at x=3 blocks the path to the apples. I need to move down to clear the way. Long-term: Move down 5 turns, then turn right to (3, 4) and head for apples at (5, 6) and (5, 8).\"\n        \n        Wait, I should not be too verbose. \"Short long-term plan\".\n        \n        \"Move DOWN to clear the path to the right. I am blocked by my body. Plan to move down, then turn right to reach apples at (5, 6) and (5, 8).\"\n\n        That's short enough.\n\n        Final output structure:\n        [Reasoning/Plan]\n        DOWN\n        (Strictly one word on the last line).\n\n        Let's write it.Moving DOWN to (2, 8).
