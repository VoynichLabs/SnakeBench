However, requires an additional step upward to reach the apple.\n   - Risk: Enemy snake #0 could move upward and block or collide if their body aligns.\n   - **Next Move Potential:** Enables upward trajectory toward (5,2) and other apples like (9,7).\n\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (4, 0):**\n   - Moves toward the lower board but steers you away from the apple at (5, 2). Apple count remains distant.\n   - Risk: Limits future movement toward key apples like (5, 2) and (3,7).\n\n3. **RIGHT \u2192 (5, 1):**\n   - Immediate step toward the nearest apple at (5, 2). Manhattan distance reduces to 1 (next move UP to (5, 2) for collection).\n   - Prevents tight turns and keeps body length manageable for later turns.\n   - Enables clearer path toward goal apples like (5, 2) and (9, 7).\n\n**Critical Consideration:**\n- **Apple Priority:** The apple at (5, 2) is the closest and most accessible. Collecting it maximizes point growth and reduces snake length risk.\n- **Enemy Proximity:** Enemy snake #0 is far right; overlapping collision on our new position (5,1) is unlikely given their current position (X=9). Enemy body segments remain on the lower right corner, minimizing collision risk.\n\n**Decision:**\n- **RIGHT** is chosen to prioritize reaching the nearest apple (5,2) in the fewest steps while minimizing immediate collision risks. This aligns with the goal of efficient apple collection and maintaining movement flexibility.\n\n**Short-Term Plan:**\n1. Move RIGHT to (5,1), setting up for an UP move to collect the (5,2) apple.\n2. If the enemy snake moves predictably (e.g., LEFT), reassess and adjust to avoid head-on collisions in subsequent turns.\n3.
