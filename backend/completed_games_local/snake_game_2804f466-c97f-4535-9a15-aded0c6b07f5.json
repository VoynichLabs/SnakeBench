No snake body or head there.\n- Move is safe.\n\n**DOWN (7, 6):**\n- Cell (7, 6) is empty.\n- Move is safe.\n\n**LEFT (6, 7):**\n- Cell (6, 7) is empty.\n- Move is safe.\n\n**RIGHT (8, 7):**\n- Cell (8, 7) is empty.\n- Move is safe.\n\nAll four directions are immediately safe regarding board boundaries and direct collisions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Anticipate Enemy Snake Moves\n\nThe enemy snake (ID 0, head at (2, 5)) has two apples and a body. I should predict its movement to avoid collision.\n\nThe snake's body segments are at (2, 4) and (3, 4). This means the snake last moved from (3, 4) to (2, 4) to (2, 5). It cannot move directly backwards to (2, 4).\n\n**Predicted Moves for Snake 0:**\n- UP to (2, 6) - safe\n- DOWN to (2, 4) - invalid, into its own body\n- LEFT to (1, 5) - safe\n- RIGHT to (3, 5) - safe\n\nSo, snake 0 will likely move to (2, 6), (1, 5), or (3, 5).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate My Safe Moves Considering Enemy Position\n\nMy goal is to move toward reachable apples while maintaining safety and mobility.\n\n**UP (7, 8):**\n- Moves to an apple at (7, 8). Collecting it safely.\n- Next turn, my head is at (7, 8) and new body segment is at (7, 7).\n- Anticipating snake 0's move: if it goes to (2, 6), no collision concern.\n- This move prioritizes apple collection.\n\n**DOWN (7, 6):**\n- Moves away from any immediate apple.\n- Safe for next turn.\n- Keeps options open.\n\n**LEFT (6, 7):**\n- Moves toward the apple at (6, 3) and (7, 4).\n- No immediate apple collection.\n- Maintains good board position.\n\n**RIGHT (8, 7):**\n- Moves away from all current apples.\n- Keeps options open but less directly helpful short-term.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Select Optimal Move\n\nThe apple at (7, 8) is right above my head. Taking it will:\n\n1. Give me a point, improving my score relative to the enemy (currently 0 vs 2).\n2. Position me well on the upper right side of the board.\n3. Cause growth, with new body at (7, 7) which is safe.\n\nEnemy snake's likely moves (to (2,6), (1,5), or (3,5)) do not threaten my move up to (7,8).\n\n### Plan For Next Turn:\nAfter UP to (7, 8), my head is at (7, 8) and body is at (7, 7). I should plan to avoid getting trapped in the upper-right corner, and start thinking about the next apple at (7, 4) or (6, 3).\n\nUP",

DOWN would be into its own body at (7, 1).\n\n### Apple Analysis\n\nApples are at:\n- (7, 4)\n- (0, 6)\n- (3, 7)\n- (3, 4)\n- (1, 9)\n\nThe closest apple to my head (5, 7) is (3, 7), which is 2 moves away to the LEFT.\n\n### Move Evaluation\n\n1. **UP** to (5, 8):\n   - **Invalid**: This is into my own body segment. I would die.\n\n2. **DOWN** to (5, 6):\n   - **Valid**: Stays on the board and not into any body.\n   - This moves me away from the nearest apple at (3, 7).\n\n3. **LEFT** to (4, 7):\n   - **Valid**: Stays on the board and not into any body.\n   - This is a step towards the nearest apple at (3, 7).\n   - Future moves from (4, 7): UP to (4, 8), DOWN to (4, 6), LEFT to (3, 7 - the apple). RIGHT to (5, 7 - my old head position, invalid).\n   - This keeps options open.\n\n4. **RIGHT** to (6, 7):\n   - **Valid**: Stays on the board and not into any body.\n   - This moves me away from any reachable apple for now.\n\n### Strategic Consideration\n\n- Moving LEFT to (4, 7) puts me on a direct path to the apple at (3, 7). This is a safe move and advances my position toward a growth opportunity.\n- Moving DOWN to (5, 6) is safe but does not advance toward any apple and moves me further from the nearest one.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6, 7) is safe but also moves me away from apples.\n- The enemy snake at (7, 2) is far enough that its immediate moves are not a direct threat.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** Move LEFT toward (3, 7). On the next turn from (4, 7), I can move LEFT to get the apple at (3, 7) if it's still there. This is a safe and productive path.\n\nLEFT",
