RIGHT similarly nears (8,2) but offers fewer lateral escapes.\n\nLong-term plan: Prioritize eating the (7,5) apple next turn, then scan for (8,9)/(8,8) cluster or (6,6)/(6,7) without flanking enemy from left-side apples.

No body segments yet, so no self-collision.  \n\n**Enemy snake at (7, 3):**  \nIt can move UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT. It\u2019s far away (5 steps right, 1 step up from me), so no possible head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**Which move is best?**  \nBoth DOWN and LEFT lead directly to apples. Eating an apple now will give me a body segment at (2, 2) next turn.  \n\nIf I eat an apple, I grow, so my tail will stay at (2, 2) for now. That means next turn my head will be on the apple cell, and my body will occupy (2, 2), which could limit moves if I go into a corner.  \n\nCheck each apple move:  \n\n1. **LEFT to (1, 2)** \u2013 Apple there. After eating, my body at (2, 2), head at (1, 2). From (1, 2), possible moves: UP to (1, 3) (apple), DOWN to (1, 1) (apple), LEFT to (0, 2) (empty), RIGHT back to (2, 2) (body \u2013 not allowed). So 3 safe moves next turn, two toward apples.  \n\n2. **DOWN to (2, 1)** \u2013 Apple there. After eating, body at (2, 2), head at (2, 1). From (2, 1): UP back to (2, 2) (body \u2013 not allowed), DOWN to (2, 0) (empty), LEFT to (1, 1) (apple), RIGHT to (3, 1) (empty). So 3 safe moves next turn, one toward apple.  \n\nBoth give 3 safe moves next turn, but LEFT gives two apple options next turn.  \n\nAlso, LEFT moves me away from the center but not into a dead end yet.  \n\n**Long-term thinking:**  \nEarly game: collect apples but keep space to maneuver. Avoid boxing myself in.  \n\nLEFT seems slightly better because (1, 2) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 maybe (1, 4) etc. along column 1 has apples at (1, 3), (1, 1), (1, 0). Could chain them.  \n\nBut DOWN to (2, 1) also fine. Let\u2019s check safety:  \nEnemy at (7, 3) not a threat now.  \n\nI\u2019ll pick **LEFT** to get apple and set up for another apple next turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 2) with body at (2, 2), avoid moving RIGHT into body. Prefer UP to (1, 3) for apple if safe, else DOWN to (1, 1) for apple, else LEFT to (0, 2) to open space.  \n\nLEFT",

My key goal is to eat the nearby apple at (7,5) to grow early and maintain flexibility, especially since the last move positioned me optimally for this. Among the options:\n\n- **UP** to (7,5): Directly eats the apple, extending my length to 2 and opening paths northward (e.g., toward the (6,6)/(6,7)/(8,8)/(8,9) cluster) while keeping south (7,4) as new body out of bounds. This aligns with the prior plan to prioritize this apple and keeps multiple safe follow-ups (LEFT to (6,5), RIGHT to (8,5), UP to (7,6)), avoiding tighter spaces near the enemy or bottom-left apples where traps could form later as we both grow.\n- **DOWN** to (7,3): Safe and flexible on its own, but pulls me slightly southward toward the bottom area (near (0,0)/(1,1) cluster where enemy snake #0 is active at (1,2)), potentially risking future head-on collisions or blockages if the enemy expands left/right from its position. Fewer immediate apple near (7,3) compared to (7,5).\n- **LEFT** to (6,4): Safe, but moves me west without eating anything soon, closer to potential enemy paths or boundary risk if looping west later; keeps options but underutilizes the nearby apple.\n- **RIGHT** to (8,4): Safe and approaches the (8,2) apple below, but (7,5) is a guaranteed eat now with better long-term paths open (e.g., upward or eastward) compared to rightward confinement.\n\nPrioritizing apple collection and open options favors UP. Enemy snake #0, at (1,2) with a tail at (2,2), might head left toward (1,1)/(1,3) apples or down/offensively, but UP maintains distance and avoids speculative collisions\u2014enemy would need to unusually extend right to reach me here.\n\nLong-term plan: Post-growth at (7,5), head north or east to gobble (6,6)/(6,7) or (8,8)/(8,9) without crowding the board's west/left, watching for enemy expansion toward the left apples to avoid flanking or traps. Grow steadily while the board is vast, targeting high-apple areas and ensuring 3+ safe moves per step to dodge dead ends, aiming for 50 apples before turn 150 or enemy elimination.\n\nUP",

The enemy snake (head at 1,1 with body at 1,2 and 2,2) has 2 apples, so I need to keep growing safely to aim for 50 apples or outlast them. The board is still very open with many apples scattered, particularly a cluster around (6,6) and (6,7) to the northwest, which aligns with my last plan to push north while avoiding the west where the enemy is active (near apples like 1,3 and 2,1).\n\nEvaluating the four possible moves:\n- **UP** to (7,6): Safe (on board, not into any body, not backwards). No enemy can reach (7,6) this turn. Leaves multiple follow-up options: LEFT to (6,6) for an apple next, RIGHT to (8,6), or UP to (7,7). Keeps me heading north toward that apple cluster, as per my plan, without closing in on the enemy.\n- **LEFT** to (6,5): Safe (on board, not into any body). Good flexibility for UP to (6,6) on the next turn to eat. However, it moves me slightly west, potentially closer to enemy paths (e.g., if they head right to 2,1) than sticking north. Still 3 safe follows: UP, DOWN to (6,4), LEFT to (5,5).\n- **RIGHT** to (8,5): Safe (on board, not into any body). Opens eastward toward a possible apple at (9,5) or into the east cluster later, but moves away from the immediate northwest apples and might isolate me if the enemy expands west. Follow-ups include UP, DOWN, RIGHT to (9,5).\n- **DOWN** to (7,4): Immediately death \u2013 moves into my own body (backwards into the cell directly behind my head).\n\nNo moves trigger head-on collisions this turn, as the enemy head is far west. Among safe options, UP best advances my northbound strategy for apple collection (e.g., (6,6) reachable in 2 turns) while maintaining distance from the enemy and keeping at least 3 safe follow-ups, preventing traps.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue North from here to eat (6,6)/(6,7) cluster quickly for growth, then swing east to (8,8)/(8,9) or (9,5) apples if the board stays open. Monitor enemy \u2013 if they loop westward aggressively, skirt north/east to flank and eat while avoiding dead ends. Target steady growth without crowding, aiming for 50 apples or enemy death.UP",

If growth lags, prioritize eating opportunistically over conservative paths. Aim to hit 5-10 apples before mid-game, forcing enemy into tight spaces. Monitor for head-ons or trapping near board edges/walls.\n\nLEFT",

Goals: continue eating the northwest cluster ((6,7), (5,6), (6,3), etc.) for quick growth to close their 1-apple lead, while maintaining open paths (avoid edges/corners where traps form). Avoid east diversion early; monitor if enemy expands west/north for flanking later.

Follows last plan perfectly for cluster eating; from there, 3 safe follow-ups (RIGHT to (7,7) for centrality/potential (7,9), UP to (6,8), LEFT to (5,7)). Edges closer to north apples ((9,5), (7,9)) without closing in; no dead-ends yet. Keeps vs. enemy defended in open board.\n- **LEFT** to (5,6): Safe (eats apple immediately, +1 apple to 3, length 4).

Goals: Continue northwest growth via (5,6) next for another quick apple to close their 1-apple lead, maintaining fluid options (basic arithmetic: leveraging central positions avoids corners/edges where length can trap you; aim for 6-7 apples by turn 10-12 while scouting east opportunistically). If enemy stagnates/dies, pivot to southeast for (8,8)/(7,9); keep paths open, avoid tight clusters early.\n\nEvaluation of moves:\n- **LEFT** to (5,7): Safe (empty cell). Enables instant follow-up DOWN to (5,6) for guaranteed apple eat (+1 to 4 apples, length 5), with 4 open directions after ((5,8), (4,7), (6,7), (5,6)). Follows last plan perfectly for cluster eating without sidelining; earliest growth option vs. others. No risk of head-on (enemy heads northwest/clamp in south positioning them ~5 cells away minimum).

Good if prioritizing long-term east push, but no immediate eat\u2014delays vs. left's potential and lets enemy possibly nibble west undisturbed. Valid but less aggressive.\n- **UP** to (6,8): Safe (empty). Central for splitting plays (e.g., LEFT to (5,8)/(4,4) or RIGHT to (7,8)/(9,5)), with 4 directions. Keeps options wide-open, but no growth this turn, allowing potential enemy catch-up on west apples\u2014suboptimal when growth leads exist.\n- **DOWN** to (6,6): Into own body (immediate segment)\u2014death.

RIGHT is decent but non-growth; UP conserves but lacks urgency. Prioritize growth over caution here.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat (5,6) next via LEFT, then from there shift LEFT/RIGHT toward (4,5)/(6,3) or north for (5,8) route to (7,9)\u2014sustain northwest munch to 5-6 apples by turn 8-10. If enemy loops north (e.g., toward (1,6)), flank south to box them or snatch (2,4)/(0,0); else, probe east mid-board. If they die or we tie apples, solo clear remaining.

UP moves toward center-top apples and keeps flexibility. RIGHT moves toward (5, 2) apple but also toward enemy territory (enemy at (5, 6)). Currently enemy is far, but moving right may eventually bring me closer to conflict.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose **UP** to progress toward apples while keeping options open and staying slightly away from enemy.  \n\nUP",
