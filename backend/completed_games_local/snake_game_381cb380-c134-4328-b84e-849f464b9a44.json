          "rationale": "Let me analyze the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, I'm the only snake with a body (just the head at (1,3)), and there's one opponent snake at (0,0) with no body. The board is 10x10, with apples scattered throughout. I have zero apples so far, and the opponent also has zero.\n\nMy head is at (1,3). Possible moves:\n- UP: (1,4)\n- DOWN: (1,2)\n- LEFT: (0,3)\n- RIGHT: (2,3)\n\nLet's check each for immediate death:\n\n1. **UP to (1,4):**\n   - (1,4) is empty on the board (no apple, no body, not out of bounds).\n   - Not into my own body (I have no body yet).\n   - Not into opponent's body (opponent is only at (0,0)).\n   - Not off the board.\n   => SAFE\n\n2. **DOWN to (1,2):**\n   - (1,2) is empty.\n   - Not into my own body.\n   - Not into opponent's body.\n   => SAFE\n\n3. **LEFT to (0,3):**\n   - (0,3) is empty.\n   - Not into my own body.\n   - Not into opponent's body (opponent is at (0,0)).\n   => SAFE\n\n4. **RIGHT to (2,3):**\n   - (2,3) is empty.\n   => SAFE\n\nSo all four moves are physically safe this turn.\n\nNow, let's consider apples I could reach in one move:\n- (1,4) has no apple.\n- (1,2) has no apple.\n- (0,3) has no apple.\n- (2,3) has no apple.\n\nBut after moving, I will have a new body segment at my old position, so next turn my body will start to grow if I eat an apple.\n\nLet's look for apples that are one move away from any of these positions:\n- From (1,4): Up to (1,5) (empty), Down to (1,3) (was my head, now body), Left to (0,4) (empty), Right to (2,4) (empty). Nearest apple is at (3,4) (two moves right and one up), or (2,8) (far away).\n- From (1,2): Up to (1,3) (body), Down to (1,1) (empty), Left to (0,2) (empty), Right to (2,2) (empty). Nearest apple is (3,0) (diagonally down-right, two moves away), or (5,1) (right and up).\n- From (0,3): Up to (0,4) (empty), Down to (0,2) (empty), Left to (-1,3) (off board!), Right to (1,3) (body). If I go left, I'd go off the board if I try to go further left, but this move itself is safe. However, going left puts me closer to the left edge, which is a dead end if I keep going left.\n- From (2,3): Up to (2,4) (empty), Down to (2,2) (empty), Left to (1,3) (body), Right to (3,3) (empty). Nearest apple is (3,4) (one up and one right), or (2,8) (far up).\n\nLong-term, I want to avoid getting boxed into a corner or being forced into a dead end. The left edge is particularly limiting because you can't go left from x=0. So, unless there's an urgent apple, I should avoid hugging the left wall for too long.\n\nRight now, none of the moves gets me to an apple in one step. But moving right or up gives me more open space for maneuvering, while moving left puts me closer to the wall.\n\nAdditionally, the opponent is at (0,0). If I go to (0,3), I'm not directly threatening or threatened, but if the opponent moves up, they could try to intercept me.\n\nA good strategy is to keep my options open and head toward clusters of apples. The apples at (3,4), (5,1), (6,6), (8,9), etc., are the closest clusters.\n\nSo, among the safe moves, RIGHT and UP both keep me away from the wall and give me more room to maneuver. LEFT is less desirable unless I see an immediate apple or a forced path. DOWN is also safe but less promising for reaching the dense apple clusters in the upper right.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT, RIGHT gets me closer to the cluster near (3,4), (6,6), (8,7), etc.\n\nTherefore, I will choose RIGHT as my move.\n\nPlan for the next few turns: Move right to (2,3), then continue toward the cluster of apples near the upper right, avoiding the left edge and keeping space to maneuver. Watch opponent's movements and avoid head-on collisions or getting boxed in.\n\nRIGHT",

          "move": "RIGHT",
          "rationale": "First, I need to analyze the current game state and decide my next move for snake #1.\n\n**Current State:**\n- My snake (ID 1): Head at (0,0), no body, apples collected: 0\n- Enemy snake (#0): Head at (1,3), no body, apples: 0\n- Apples are at various positions, but notably, there's an apple at (3,0) which is close to my head at (0,0). Also, there's an apple at (0,0)? Wait, from the board state, at (0,0) it says \"1\", which is my head, and at (3,0) it says \"A\" for apple. So no apple at (0,0).\n\n**Board State Visualization:**\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . A .\nRow 8: . . A . . A A . . .\nRow 7: . . . . . . A . A .\nRow 6: . . . . . A A . . .\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 4: . . . A . . . . . .\nRow 3: . 0 . . . . . A . A\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 1: . . . . . A . A . .\nRow 0: 1 . . A . . . . A .\nColumns: 0 to 9\n\nSo, from (0,0), I can move to:\n- UP: (0,1) - from row 1, column 0: ., so empty? Wait, row 1, column 0: . (from \"1 . . . . A . A . .\" for row 1? Let's clarify the board state string.\n\nThe board state is given as:\n9 . . . . . . . . A .\n8 . . A . . A A . . .\n7 . . . . . . A . A .\n6 . . . . . A A . . .\n5 . . . . . . . . . .\n4 . . . A . . . . . .\n3 . 0 . . . . . A . A\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . A . A . .\n0 1 . . A . . . . A .\n\nSo, for row 0: \"1 . . A . . . . A .\" means:\n- column 0: 1 (my head)\n- column 1: . (empty)\n- column 2: . (empty)\n- column 3: A (apple)\n- etc.\n\nSimilarly, row 1: \" . . . . . A . A . .\" but wait, the first character is for column 0? Actually, looking at row 0: \"0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\" is written below, so the first character of each line corresponds to column 0.\n\nLet me parse the board properly:\n\nRow 9: column 0: ., col1: ., col2: ., col3: ., col4: ., col5: ., col6: ., col7: ., col8: A, col9: . (but wait, it says \"9 . . . . . . . . A .\" so after the row number, it's the cells from col 0 to 9? Actually, looking at the format: it has row number, then 10 characters for columns 0 to 9? But there are 11 characters after the row number? Let's count: for row 9: \" . . . . . . . . A .\" that's 10 dots and As? No, let's list them:\n\nFor row 9: \"9 . . . . . . . . A .\" - after \"9\" there are 10 characters: space, dot, space, dot, space, dot, space, dot, space, dot, space, dot, space, dot, space, A, space, dot? This is messy.\n\nFrom the text: \"9 . . . . . . . . A .\" - if I ignore the row number and the spaces, it's probably meant to be 10 cells: positions 0 to 9. Similarly for all rows. So for row 9, the cells are: col0: ., col1: ., col2: ., col3: ., col4: ., col5: ., col6: ., col7: ., col8: A, col9: .? But it says \" . . . . . . . . A .\" which is 9 dots and one A? Let's count the characters between spaces.\n\nActually, from the coordinate reminder, it's a 10x10 board, so each row should have 10 cells. Looking at the string for row 0: \"0 1 . . A . . . . A .\" - after \"0\" it has: 1 (which is the snake head), then ., then ., then A, then ., then ., then ., then ., then A, then .? That's 10 characters? Let's list the characters after the row number, ignoring spaces? But the text has spaces between each cell representation.\n\nI think it's easier to use the given coordinate ranges and the fact that the first tuple is the head. So for my snake, head is at (0,0). For enemy, head at (1,3).\n\nFrom the board state, at (0,0) it's my head. At (3,0) there is an apple (A). At (1,3) there is enemy head (0).\n\nNow, for my possible moves from (0,0):\n- UP: to (0,1) - from board, row 1, col 0: from row 1 string: \" . . . . . A . A . .\" but after row number, the first character is for col 0? From row 1: \"1 . . . . . A . A . .\" wait no, the row is \"1 . . . . . A . A . .\" but that has 10 characters? Let's see the pattern: for row 0: \"0 1 . . A . . . . A .\" - here, after \"0\", it has \"1\" which is the snake, then spaces? Actually, from the text, it seems like each row is written with row number, then the cell values for col 0 to 9, with spaces between them. So for row 0: \"0\" then cell for col 0: \"1\", then col 1: \".\", col 2: \".\", col 3: \"A\", col 4: \".\", col 5: \".\", col 6: \".\", col 7: \".\", col 8: \"A\", col 9: \".\". Similarly for row 1: \"1\" then col 0: \".\", col 1: \".\", col 2: \".\", col 3: \".\", col 4: \".\", col 5: \"A\", col 6: \".\", col 7: \"A\", col 8: \".\", col 9: \".\". But the string says \"1 . . . . . A . A . .\" which has 10 characters after \"1\" if we count the dots and As? Actually, \" . . . . . A . A . .\" has 10 items if we consider each dot or A as a cell, but there are spaces? To avoid confusion, I'll use the coordinate list from the apples and snake positions.\n\nFrom the apples list: (9,3), (5,8), etc., so y=0 is bottom, y=9 is top. x=0 left, x=9 right.\n\nFrom my head at (0,0):\n- UP: (0,1) - check if it's safe. From board, row 1, col 0: from row 1 in board state, it's \".\" meaning empty? But let's confirm with the apple list. Is (0,1) an apple? Apples are at (9,3), (5,8), (6,6), (8,9), (2,8), (5,1), (3,4), (6,7), (8,7), (3,0), (7,3), (6,8), (8,0), (5,6), (7,1). So (0,1) is not in the apple list, so probably empty. Also, no snake body at (0,1) since both snakes have only head, no body. So (0,1) is empty and on board.\n\n- DOWN: to (0,-1) - but y=-1 is outside the board, so this move would kill me. So DOWN is invalid.\n\n- LEFT: to (-1,0) - x=-1 outside board, invalid.\n\n- RIGHT: to (1,0) - from board, row 0, col 1: from row 0, col 1 is \".\" (since after \"1\" at col 0, col 1 is \".\"). Also, no apple at (1,0) from list. So empty.\n\nSo safe moves are UP and RIGHT. DOWN and LEFT are off-board.\n\nNow, among UP and RIGHT, which one is better?\n\nI need to consider apples and future options.\n\nApples close to me: from (0,0), the closest apple is at (3,0) which is to the right. Also, there is an apple at (5,1) and (7,1), but (3,0) is closer.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1,0), I am closer to (3,0). From (1,0), I can go right to (2,0), then (3,0) to eat the apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (0,1), I am moving away from the apple at (3,0), but there might be other apples? From the list, there is an apple at (5,1) which is at y=1, x=5, so from (0,1) I could go right towards (5,1), but (5,1) is farther than (3,0) from (0,0). From (0,0) to (3,0) is distance 3, from (0,0) to (5,1) is distance |5-0| + |1-0| = 6, so (3,0) is closer.\n\nAlso, from (0,1), I might have more options? But let's see the board.\n\nNow, I need to consider the enemy snake. Enemy head at (1,3). It might move in some direction. I don't know what it will do, but I should avoid potential head-on collisions.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1,0), and enemy moves DOWN to (1,2) or something, but since it's at (1,3), if it moves DOWN to (1,2), it might not collide with me at (1,0) immediately. But heads moving into the same cell: if I move to (1,0) and enemy moves to (1,0), but enemy is at (1,3), so it would have to move DOWN three times to reach (1,0), but in one turn, it moves one cell, so it can only reach (1,2) if it moves DOWN. So probably no immediate head-on collision with me at (1,0) since enemy is at (1,3) and can only move to adjacent cells.\n\nSimilarly, if I move UP to (0,1), enemy at (1,3) might move left to (0,3) or something, but not directly to (0,1).\n\nSo both moves seem safe from immediate collision.\n\nNow, considering future moves: if I move RIGHT to (1,0), I have two safe directions: UP to (1,1) or RIGHT to (2,0). LEFT would be back to (0,0), but since I have no body, moving backwards is not into my own body, so it might be safe, but usually, it's better to avoid going back unless necessary. From (1,0), moving LEFT to (0,0) is fine since no body, but it doesn't progress. So I can go UP or RIGHT.\n\nFrom (0,1), if I move UP, I can go to (0,2), or RIGHT to (1,1), or LEFT? But LEFT from (0,1) is (-1,1) off-board, so only UP and RIGHT.\n\nSo from (0,1), I have UP to (0,2) or RIGHT to (1,1).\n\nNow, which move gives me more options? From (1,0), I can go to (1,1) or (2,0), both might lead to apples. From (0,1), I can go to (0,2) or (1,1). But (0,2) might not have apples directly, but from the list, there is an apple at (2,8) which is far, or (3,4), etc. Not immediately close.\n\nWhereas from (1,0), I can go to (2,0) and then to (3,0) for apple.\n\nAlso, from (0,1), if I go to (1,1), then from there I can go to (2,1) or (1,2), etc., but (1,1) is not an apple, and (2,1) is not an apple? Apples are at (5,1), so from (1,1) to (5,1) is distance 4, while from (1,0) to (3,0) is distance 2.\n\nSo moving RIGHT seems better for reaching the closest apple quickly.\n\nBut I need to consider that after eating an apple, I grow, so my tail will be at previous position, but since I have no body now, after eating, I will have a body segment at my previous head position. But for now, since I have no body, moving into any cell is safe as long as it's not off-board or into another snake.\n\nAlso, I should avoid getting trapped. From (0,0), if I move RIGHT, I might be in a position where I can be surrounded, but since the board is open, probably not.\n\nAnother thing: the enemy snake might go for apples too. The apple at (3,0) is close to me, but enemy is at (1,3), which is also close to some apples? From (1,3), apples at (3,4) or (2,8) or others, but (3,0) is at distance |3-1| + |0-3| = 2+3=5, while from me, it's distance 3. So I have a shorter path to (3,0).\n\nBut I need to move first. Since all move simultaneously, if I move to (1,0) and enemy moves to somewhere, but if enemy moves to (2,3) or something, it doesn't affect me directly.\n\nNow, for head-on collision: if two snakes move to the same cell. From my current position, if I move to (1,0), enemy might move to (1,0)? But enemy is at (1,3), so it would have to move DOWN to (1,2), then (1,1), then (1,0) in three turns, not in one turn. So in one turn, it can only move to adjacent cells: from (1,3), it can go to (1,2), (1,4), (0,3), (2,3). None of these are (1,0). So no risk of head-on collision with enemy in this turn if I move to (1,0).\n\nSimilarly, if I move to (0,1), enemy cannot reach (0,1) in one move from (1,3). So both are safe from head-on collision.\n\nNow, considering growth: I need to eat apples to grow and win. So moving towards apples is good.\n\nFrom (0,0), the closest apple is at (3,0). So moving RIGHT directly towards it.\n\nIf I move UP, I am not moving towards any immediate apple. There is an apple at (5,1), but it's farther, and from (0,1), I have to go right to reach it, but from (0,0) going right is more direct.\n\nAlso, from (0,0), if I move UP, I might encounter the enemy? Enemy is at (1,3), so not immediate.\n\nAnother factor: after I eat an apple, I grow, so my body will extend, which might block my own path or something, but since I have no body now, after eating, I will have one body segment, which might affect future moves, but for now, it's fine.\n\nSo, I think moving RIGHT is better than UP.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are any apples in the immediate vicinity. From (0,0), only (3,0) is close, and (5,1) is a bit farther.\n\nAlso, from the board state, at (0,0) I am, and at (1,0) it's empty, so moving RIGHT is safe.\n\nNow, what about UP? From (0,0) to (0,1), is there any apple? No, (0,1) is empty. But from (0,1), I can go to (1,1), which is empty, and then to (2,1), etc., but no apple until (5,1). Whereas from (1,0) to (2,0) to (3,0), I can eat apple at (3,0) in two moves.\n\nSo clearly, moving RIGHT gets me to an apple faster.\n\nTherefore, I should move RIGHT.\n\nBut wait, is there any risk? For example, if I move to (1,0), and then in the next turn, the enemy might move to (2,0) or something, but since I would be at (1,0), and if I move to (2,0), and enemy moves to (2,0), then head-on collision. But that's in the future, and I can decide later based on what happens.\n\nFor now, since I have to choose one move, and RIGHT seems beneficial.\n\nAlso, from the rules, I need to avoid moves that kill me immediately, and among safe moves, prefer those that increase chance of eating apples and keep options open.\n\nMoving RIGHT seems to do that.\n\nIf I move UP, I am going to a cell with no immediate apple, and I have fewer options? From (0,1), I can only go UP or RIGHT, whereas from (1,0), I can go UP or RIGHT, similar number of options.\n\nBut from (1,0), I am closer to an apple.\n\nSo, I think RIGHT is the better move.\n\nNow, for the rationale: I need to provide a short plan for the future.\n\nSo, for the next turn, I plan to move towards the apple at (3,0) by going RIGHT, then in the next turn, if safe, move RIGHT again to (2,0), then to (3,0) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to be careful about the enemy snake.\n\nSo, my move: RIGHT\n\nThen, for the plan: \"Move towards the apple at (3,0) by going right. After eating, grow and explore further.\"\n\nBut since the move is for turn 0, and I need to output only the move at the end.\n\nThe instruction says: \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.\"\n\nBut it also says: \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning. You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo, I need to have my reasoning and plan before the final move word.\n\nSo, I'll write my reasoning, then the plan, then the move.\n\nBut since it says \"the final non-empty line must be exactly one word\", I should have all my text above, and then on the last line, just the word.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nMy reasoning: I am at (0,0) with no body. I can move UP or RIGHT since DOWN and LEFT are off-board. Moving RIGHT to (1,0) takes me closer to the apple at (3,0), which is the nearest apple. Moving UP to (0,1) does not immediately lead to an apple. Therefore, I choose RIGHT.\n\nPlan: Move towards (3,0) and eat the apple in the next few turns. Be aware of the enemy snake at (1,3) and avoid collisions.\n\nThen, on the last line: RIGHT\n\nBut I need to make sure that the plan is short and for the next few turns.\n\nAlso, I should consider that after eating the apple, I will grow, so my body will be at previous head position, which might affect future moves.\n\nBut for now, it's fine.\n\nAnother thing: in the board state, there is an apple at (8,0) which is also on the bottom row, but from (0,0), it's far, so I should go for the closer one.\n\nAlso, there is an apple at (3,0), which is at x=3, y=0, so on the same row.\n\nNow, is there any snake body between me and (3,0)? From the board, from (0,0) to (3,0), the cells are (1,0), (2,0), (3,0). From row 0, we have: col0:1, col1:., col2:., col3:A, so yes, empty until the apple.\n\nSo no obstacles.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT is safe and beneficial.\n\nSo, I'll go withI am at (0,0) with no body. The safe moves are UP to (0,1) and RIGHT to (1,0), since DOWN and LEFT would move off the board. Moving RIGHT brings me closer to the apple at (3,0), which is the nearest apple and can be reached in two moves by going RIGHT again. Moving UP to (0,1) does not lead directly to any close apple, as the next apple in that direction is at (5,1), which is farther away. Therefore, I choose RIGHT to efficiently pursue the apple at (3,0).\n\nPlan: Move towards the apple at (3,0) by going right, then eat it in the next turn. Monitor the enemy snake at (1,3) for potential collisions after I grow.\n\nRIGHT",

I have two valid open moves: UP and LEFT.\n- **UP** leads towards a cluster of apples: (3,4), (5,1), (5,6).\n- **LEFT** leads towards (0,7) but is initially empty.\n\nMoving **UP** is the best strategic choice. It moves towards the nearest apple clusters and keeps future paths open. Moving **LEFT** is also safe (moving into the vacating tail) but moves me away from the dense apple areas near the top-left of the board.\n\nMy choice: **UP**.\n\nMy snake (ID 1) is at (3,0). I need to choose a move for this turn.\n1.  **Evaluate Potential Moves:**\n    *   **UP:** (3,1). Within bounds. Empty. Safe. Leads towards apples at (3,4) and (5,1).\n    *   **DOWN:** (3,-1). Off board. **ILLEGAL**.\n    *   **LEFT:** (2,0). This was my previous position (tail). Since I likely ate an apple at (3,0) last turn, my tail will vacate (2,0) this turn. This is safe.\n    *   **RIGHT:** (4,0). Empty. Safe, but leads to a dead end at (5,0) and the wall.\n\n2.  **Strategic Analysis:**\n    *   **Goal:** Collect apples safely and avoid dead ends.\n    *   **RIGHT** is bad (dead end).\n    *   **LEFT** is safe (into vacating tail) but moves away from the main apple clusters (e.g., at (3,4)).\n    *   **UP** is safe and moves towards the nearest reachable apples. It also maintains flexibility.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    **UP** is the best move to progress towards apples and avoid getting trapped.\n\nUP",

My body occupies `(5, 1)` and `(4, 1)`.\n2.  **Apples:** I am currently standing on an apple at `(6, 1)`. My previous move RIGHT successfully consumed it. I will grow after this turn. Adjacent apples include `(7, 1)` to the right and `(5, 3)` up and to the left.\n3.  **Enemy Snake:** Snake #0 is at `(8, 3)`.\n4.  **Potential Moves:**\n    *   **UP:** `(6, 2)` is empty.\n    *   **DOWN:** `(6, 0)` is empty.\n    *   **LEFT:** `(5, 1)` is occupied by my own body. **Invalid**.\n    *   **RIGHT:** `(7, 1)` is an apple.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nMy current goal is to collect apples while avoiding collision. I am currently \"growing\" because I just ate an apple, so I don't need to worry about my tail moving into my head's previous position yet (since I'm growing, the tail stays put).\n\n**Immediate Move Selection:**\nI need to evaluate the safety of the remaining moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).\n-   **LEFT:** Hitting my own body at `(5, 1)`. Immediate death. **Invalid**.\n-   **RIGHT:** Moving to `(7, 1)` is valid. It is an apple, so I will grow again. It is adjacent to the wall at x=9, but plenty of room.\n-   **UP & DOWN:** These are valid moves to empty cells.\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\nI must consider the enemy snake (Snake #0) at `(8, 3)`.\nSnake #0's potential moves are `(8, 3)`, `(7, 2)`, `(9, 3)`, `(8, 4)`.\nNone of these positions are `(7, 1)`. The distance from Snake #0's head `(8, 3)` to `(7, 1)` is `|8-7| + |3-1| = 3`. It cannot reach `(7, 1)` this turn.\nTherefore, moving **RIGHT** to `(7, 1)` is safe from head-on collision with Snake #0 this turn.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **RIGHT** is the optimal move as it secures an immediate apple and keeps me on a trajectory to potentially collect more apples in the lower-right quadrant `(7, 1) -> (8, 1) -> (9, 1)`. It is safe from immediate collision.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nSecure the apple at `(7, 1)` immediately. After eating, I will be at `(7, 1)` with a body length of 4. From there, I will check if `(8, 1)` or `(9, 1)` are accessible. I need to keep an eye on Snake #0 at `(8, 3)` to ensure I don't get trapped.\n\nRIGHT",

This confirms I ate it last turn. I will grow. There is an apple at `(8, 0)` to the bottom-right and `(8, 1)` is currently empty but on the way to `(9, 1)`.\n3.  **Enemy Snake:** Snake #0 is at `(9, 3)` with body `(8, 3), (7, 3)`.\n4.  **Potential Moves:**\n    *   **UP:** `(7, 2)` is empty.\n    *   **DOWN:** `(7, 0)` is empty.\n    *   **LEFT:** `(6, 1)` is occupied by my own body. **Invalid**.\n    *   **RIGHT:** `(8, 1)` is empty.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nI am still growing from the previous apple (Turn 8). My head is now `(7, 1)` (the apple I just ate).\n\n*   **LEFT:** `(6, 1)` is my body. **Invalid**.\n*   **UP:** `(7, 2)` is empty. It is near Snake #0 at `(9, 3)` and `(8, 3)`. If I go UP, I might be moving closer to the enemy.\n*   **DOWN:** `(7, 0)` is empty. It is near the apple at `(8, 0)`. This looks like a safe move to collect the bottom-right apples.\n*   **RIGHT:** `(8, 1)` is empty. This keeps me on the bottom row line.\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\nSnake #0 is at `(9, 3)`. Its possible moves: `(9, 2)`, `(9, 4)`, `(8, 3)`, `(10, 3)`. None of these threaten `(7, 0)`, `(7, 2)`, or `(8, 1)` immediately.\n\n**Decision:**\nI want to collect the apple at `(8, 0)`.\nIf I move **DOWN** to `(7, 0)`, I am adjacent to `(8, 0)`. From `(7, 0)`, I can move **RIGHT** to `(8, 0)` next turn to eat.\nAlternatively, if I move **RIGHT** to `(8, 1)`, I am adjacent to `(8, 0)` as well. From `(8, 1)`, I can move **DOWN** to `(8, 0)`.\nHowever, looking at the board state:\nRow 0: `. . . . . . . . A .`\nRow 1: `. . . . T T T 1 . .`\nMoving **DOWN** to `(7, 0)` seems safer because it moves away from the snake cluster at `(7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3)`. Moving UP might corner me near the wall at `(9, 9)` or the enemy.\nSo, **DOWN** is the optimal move to approach the apple at `(8, 0)` and open up the bottom area.\n\nWait, let me re-evaluate the board.\nApple at `(8, 0)`.\nMoving **DOWN** to `(7, 0)` is good.\nMoving **RIGHT** to `(8, 1)` is also good.\nLet's look at the row 2: `. A . . . . . . . .`\nIf I go DOWN to `(7, 0)`, I can then go DOWN again? No, `y=0` is the bottom. So from `(7, 0)`, I can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\nFrom `(7, 0)`, `RIGHT` to `(8, 0)` eats the apple.\nFrom `(7, 0)`, `UP` to `(7, 1)` is my body (since I am growing, the tail won't move yet? No, the tail moves every turn unless I eat. If I don't eat this turn, the tail moves. If I eat this turn, tail stays).\nSo, moving **DOWN** seems like the best path to the apple at `(8, 0)`.\n\nLet's check if `(8, 1)` is better.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to `(8, 1)`, I am close to `(8, 0)`.\nBut looking at the board, row 1 has `1` at `(7, 1)`. The body `T T T` is at `(6,1), (5,1), (4,1)`.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to `(8, 1)`, I am stepping next to the corner `(9, 0)`.\nActually, `(7, 0)` is more central in the bottom row than `(8, 1)` is to the top.\nAlso, I am currently at `(7, 1)`. I just ate.\nIf I move **DOWN** to `(7, 0)`, I am at the bottom.\nIf I move **RIGHT** to `(8, 1)`, I am at the bottom.\nThe apple at `(8, 0)` is at the bottom right.\nLet's try to approach it from the left.\nSo, **DOWN** to `(7, 0)`.\n\nWait, looking at the previous turn's move: I moved RIGHT to `(7, 1)`.\nMy body is currently `[ (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1) ]`.\nI am eating at `(7, 1)`.\nSo the turn just happened.\nTurn 9.\nI am at `(7, 1)`.\nIf I move **DOWN** to `(7, 0)`.\nIf I move **RIGHT** to `(8, 1)`.\nIf I move **UP** to `(7, 2)`.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 0: `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`\n`. . . . . . . . A .`\nApple at `(8, 0)`.\nI am at `(7, 1)`.\nIf I move **DOWN**, I am at `(7, 0)`.\nThen next turn I can go **RIGHT** to `(8, 0)`.\nIf I move **RIGHT**, I am at `(8, 1)`.\nThen next turn I can go **DOWN** to `(8, 0)`.\n\nWhy choose one over the other?\nLooking at the empty spaces.\nFrom `(7, 0)`, I have access to `(6, 0)`, `(7, 1)` (my tail will move if I don't eat this turn... wait, I am eating? I am at `(7, 1)` which is an apple. I ate it last turn. I am growing. This turn I am moving FROM `(7, 1)`. If I land on an apple, I grow more. If not, I just move.\nThe apple I am on now is the one I just ate.\nSo I am moving from `(7, 1)`.\nThere is an apple at `(8, 0)`.\nThere is an apple at `(9, 1)`? No.\nThere is an apple at `(8, 1)`?

This usually limits my movement (can't go down further).\nGoing **RIGHT** takes me to `(8, 1)`. From there I can go DOWN to `(8, 0)` or UP to `(8, 2)`.\nGoing **DOWN** to `(7, 0)` limits me to `(6, 0)`, `(7, 1)`, `(8, 0)`.\nI should go **RIGHT** to `(8, 1)` to keep the option of going UP if needed. But `(8, 2)` is empty (Row 2 shows empty at 8).\nWait, if I go **RIGHT** to `(8, 1)`, I am at `(8, 1)`.\nIf I go **DOWN** to `(7, 0)`, I am at `(7, 0)`.\nThe enemy is at `(9, 3)`.\nThe space around `(7, 0)` is safer than `(8, 1)`? No, `(8, 1)` is right next to `(9, 1)`.\nLet's go **DOWN**. It's a straightforward move to the bottom row to start collecting the apples there.\n\nWait, looking at the board provided in the prompt:\n`9 . . . . . . . . A .`\n`8 . . A . . A A .

(2 moves)\nBoth take 2 moves.\nHowever, `(8, 1)` is closer to `(9, 1)` (empty) and `(9, 3)` (enemy).\n`(7, 0)` is closer to `(6, 0)` (empty) and `(5, 0)` (empty).\nAlso, from `(7, 0)`, I have `RIGHT` to `(8, 0)`.\nFrom `(8, 1)`, I have `DOWN` to `(8, 0)`.\nI will move **DOWN** to `(7, 0)`.\n\nWait, I see an apple at `(0, 7)`.\nI see an apple at `(5, 8)`.\nI see an apple at `(8, 9)`.\nI am at `(7, 1)`.\nI should probably go for the clusters.\nThe cluster at `(5, 8), (6, 7), (6, 8), (8, 7), (8, 8), (8, 9)` is in the top right.\nThe cluster at `(5, 3), (3, 4), (5, 6), (6, 6)` is in the middle.\nThe apple at `(8, 0)` is isolated-ish.\nI am at `(7, 1)`. I am very close to the bottom row.\nMaybe I should stay low and go for `(8, 0)` then head to the middle?\nOr go up to the middle cluster?\n`(5, 3)` is a target.\n`(7, 1)` to `(5, 3)` is `dx=2, dy=2`.\n`(7, 1)` to `(8, 0)` is `dx=1, dy=1`.\n`(8, 0)` is closer.\nAlso, moving **DOWN** to `(7, 0)` keeps me out of the way of Snake #0 at `(9, 3)`.\nIf I move UP, I go to `(7, 2)`. That brings me closer to `(8, 3)`.\nI will stick with **DOWN**.\n\nWait, look at the board again.\nRow 1: `1 . . . . T T T 1 . .`\nRow 2: `. A . . . . . . . .`\nRow 3: `A . . . . A .

If Snake #0 goes to `(9, 2)` (which is possible if it moves DOWN from `(9, 3)`), I might be setting up for a fight.\nFrom `(7, 0)`, I am further away.\nAlso, if I go **DOWN**, I can then go **RIGHT** to `(8, 0)` and eat.\nThen I will be growing.\nI'll choose **DOWN**.\n\nOne more check: `(7, 2)` is empty.\n`(6, 2)` is empty.\n`(5, 2)` is empty.\nIf I go UP, I can eventually go LEFT to `(5, 3)` apple.\nBut `(8, 0)` is right there.\nI will take the guaranteed apple at `(8, 0)` by moving **DOWN** then **RIGHT**.\n\nActually, looking at the board state provided:\n`5 . . . . . . . . . .`\n`4 . . .

Wait, the board shows `T T 0` at `(8, 3)`. The body is `(8, 3)` and `(7, 3)`? No, the list is Head: `(9, 3)`, Body: `[(8, 3), (7, 3)]`.\nSo `(7, 3)` is body.\nSo if I go **UP** to `(7, 2)`, I cannot go **UP** to `(7, 3)`.\nI could go **LEFT** to `(6, 2)` then **UP** to `(6, 3)` etc.\nBut this is slower to reach `(5, 3)`.\nMeanwhile, `(8, 0)` is 2 steps away.\nI will go **DOWN**.\n\nActually, let me check `(8, 0)` again.\nIf I go **DOWN**, `(7, 0)`.\nNext turn I can go **RIGHT**, `(8, 0)`.\nSnake #0 is at `(9, 3)`.\nSnake #0 can go `(9, 2)`.\nIf I am at `(8, 0)`, and Snake #0 goes to `(9, 2)`, we are safe.\nIf I am at `(8, 0)`, and Snake #0 goes to `(9, 1)`, we are safe.\nIf I am at `(8, 0)`, and Snake #0 goes to `(8, 3)` (stays), safe.\nSo, **DOWN**.\n\nWait, I just noticed the score. I have 3 apples. Snake #0 has 2.\nI need to keep winning.\nThe move **DOWN** is the best.\n\nOne detail: I just ate. My body length is 4 (Head, 3 body parts).\nIf I move **DOWN** and don't eat this turn, the tail `(4, 1)` will move.\nIf I move **DOWN** to `(7, 0)` and eat... there is no apple at `(7, 0)`.\nSo I won't eat.\nSo the tail `(4, 1)` will move to `(5, 1)`, then `(6, 1)`, then `(7, 1)`?\nWait, the move happens simultaneously.\nI move to `(7, 0)`.\nMy old head `(7, 1)` becomes body.\nMy body `(6, 1)` becomes body segment behind.\nMy body `(5, 1)` becomes body segment behind.\nMy tail `(4, 1)` moves to `(5, 1)`.\nSo new body: `[(7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1)]`.\nThis is correct.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer **RIGHT** over **DOWN**?\nIf I go **RIGHT** to `(8, 1)`.\nNext turn I can go **DOWN** to `(8, 0)` to eat.\nIf I go **DOWN** to `(7, 0)` next turn.\nFrom `(7, 0)`, I can go **RIGHT** to `(8, 0)`.\nFrom `(8, 1)`, I can go **DOWN** to `(8, 0)`.\nBoth end up at `(8, 0)` next turn (assuming I don't change my mind).\nHowever, if I go **DOWN** now, I am at `(7, 0)`.\nIf Snake #0 moves aggressively, `(9, 3)` -> `(9, 2)` -> `(9, 1)` -> `(9, 0)`.\nIf I am at `(7, 0)`, I can go `(6, 0)`, `(5, 0)`, etc.\nIf I am at `(8, 1)`, I am closer to `(9, 1)`.\nI prefer to be at `(7, 0)`.\nI'll choose **DOWN**.\n\nWait, looking at the board provided in the prompt:\nRow 1: `1 . . . . T T T 1 . .`\nThis row shows `1` at `(7, 1)`.\nThe `T T T` is at `(4, 1)`, `(5, 1)`, `(6, 1)`? No, the visual is `T T T`.\nThe prompt says: `Body: [(6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1)]`.\nSo `(4, 1)` is tail.\nVisual shows: `1 . . . . T T T 1 . .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nSo `(7, 1)` is `1`.\n`(6, 1)` is `T`.\n`(5, 1)` is `T`.\n`(4, 1)` is `T`.\nCorrect.\n\nI will move **DOWN**.\n\nWait, I see an apple at `(0, 7)`.\nI see an apple at `(5, 8)`.\nI see an apple at `(8, 9)`.\nI am at `(7, 1)`.\nGoing **DOWN** to `(7, 0)` is going away from all other apples except `(8, 0)`.\nGoing **UP** to `(7, 2)` brings me closer to `(5, 3)`, `(3, 4)`, `(5, 6)`, `(5, 8)`.\nWhy am I obsessed with `(8, 0)`?\nMaybe I should go **UP**?\nLet's check the safety of **UP**.\n`(7, 2)` is empty.\nSnake #0 is at `(9, 3)`.\nDistance to `(7, 2)` is 4.\nSafe.\nIf I go **UP**, I can go **UP** to `(7, 3)`? No, `(7, 3)` is Snake #0's body.\nI can go **LEFT** to `(6, 2)`.\nThen **UP** to `(6, 3)`.\nThen **LEFT** to `(5, 3)`.\nThat's a path to `(5, 3)`.\nPath: `(7, 1)` -> `(7, 2)` -> `(6, 2)` -> `(6, 3)` -> `(5, 3)`.\nThat's 4 moves to get to `(5, 3)`.\nIf I go **DOWN**:\n`(7, 1)` -> `(7, 0)` -> `(8, 0)` (eat). Now growing.\nThen I have to turn around.\nGoing **UP** seems better for the mid-game.\nHowever, `(8, 0)` is *right there*.\nIn Snake, it's usually good to take the closest apple unless it's a trap.\nIs `(8, 0)` a trap?\n`(7, 0)` is safe.\n`(8, 0)` is safe.\nFrom `(8, 0)`, I can go `(9, 0)` or `(8, 1)`.\nIf I go `(8, 0)` -> `(9, 0)`.\nThen `(9, 1)`.\nThen `(9, 2)`.\nThen `(9, 3)` is the enemy head.\nSo I shouldn't go to `(9, 3)`.\nIf I go `(8, 0)` -> `(8, 1)`.\nI can then go `(7, 1)` but that will be my tail (since I moved away).\nSo I am stuck in the bottom right corner `(7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (8, 1), (9, 1)`.\nThis is a small area.\nThe other snakes are far away.\nI can clear the bottom right and then head to the middle.\nThis seems like a valid plan.\nSo, **DOWN**.\n\nActually, let's look at the board again.\n`9 . . . . . . . .

No, enemy body.\nI can go **LEFT** to `(6, 2)`.\nThen **UP** to `(6, 3)`.\nThen **LEFT** to `(5, 3)` (Apple).\nThis is a good path to `(5, 3)`.\nThis seems much better than the isolated `(8, 0)`.\n\nWhy did I want `(8, 0)`? Because it was there.\nBut `(5, 3)` is also there and leads to a cluster.\n`(7, 2)` is safe.\nLet's go **UP**.\nWait, is `(7, 2)` safe?\nYes, it's empty.\nIs there any reason to avoid going UP?\nIf I go UP, I am getting closer to the enemy.\nBut I am also getting closer to the center apples.\n`(5, 3)` is a good target.\nLet's try to reach `(5, 3)`.\n\nPath to `(5, 3)`:\n1. `(7, 1)` -> `(7, 2)` (UP)\n2. `(7, 2)` -> `(6, 2)` (LEFT)\n3. `(6, 2)` -> `(6, 3)` (UP)\n4. `(6, 3)` -> `(5, 3)` (LEFT)\n\nIf I go **DOWN**, I am stuck in the bottom.\nI should go **UP**.\n\nWait, what about the apple at `(8, 0)`?\nIf I go **UP**, I am leaving it.\nBut it's just one apple.\nThe cluster at `(5, 3)`, `(3, 4)`, `(5, 6)` is better.\nAnd there's `(5, 8)` above.\nSo, **UP** is the strategic move.\n\nLet's check Snake #0 again.\nHead: `(9, 3)`.\nBody: `(8, 3), (7, 3)`.\nIf I go **UP** to `(7, 2)`, I am right next to `(7, 3)`.\nIf Snake #0 moves **LEFT** to `(8, 3)`, then `(9, 3)` becomes body, `(8, 3)` becomes head.\nWait, no. If Snake #0 moves **LEFT**, its head goes to `(8, 3)`.\n`(8, 3)` is currently occupied by its body.\nWait, the body is `[(8, 3), (7, 3)]`.\nSo if it moves **LEFT**, head to `(8, 3)`. `(8, 3)` is the first body part. This is allowed. The tail `(7, 3)` moves to `(8, 3)`? No.\nHead moves to `(8, 3)`. The old head `(9, 3)` becomes body. The old body `(8, 3)` becomes... wait.\nSnake #0: Head `(9, 3)`, Body `[(8, 3), (7, 3)]`.\nIf it moves **LEFT** to `(8, 3)`:\nNew head: `(8, 3)`.\nNew body: `[(9, 3), (8, 3)]`.\nThe old body `(7, 3)` becomes the tail and moves... wait. The tail is `(7, 3)`.\nWhen the snake moves, the head moves. The segment behind the head becomes the new first body part.\nSo `(9, 3)` becomes body part 1.\n`(8, 3)` becomes body part 2.\nThe tail `(7, 3)` is removed (unless eating).\nSo new body: `[(9, 3), (8, 3)]`.\nSo if Snake #0 moves **LEFT**, its head is at `(8, 3)`.\nMy head is at `(7, 2)`.\nDistance: `|8-7| + |3-2| = 2`. Safe.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves **DOWN** to `(9, 2)`.\nMy head at `(7, 2)`. Distance: `|9-7| + |2-2| = 2`. Safe.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves **UP** to `(9, 4)`.\nSafe.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves **RIGHT** to `(10, 3)`. (Off board). It dies.\n\nSo, moving **UP** to `(7, 2)` is safe.\nAnd it leads to the apple at `(5, 3)`.\n\nI will choose **UP**.\n\nOne final check.\nI am at `(7, 1)`.\nI move **UP** to `(7, 2)`.\nMy body becomes `[(7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1)]` (since I am growing from the previous turn, the tail `(4, 1)` stays? No. I ate on Turn 8. Turn 9 I am moving.\nI ate on Turn 8. So on Turn 9, I am growing. The tail does not move this turn.\nSo my body will be:\nHead: `(7, 2)`\nBody: `[(7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1)]`\nWait, if I am growing, the tail `(4, 1)` does NOT disappear.\nSo my body is 5 segments long.\n`(7, 2)`, `(7, 1)`, `(6, 1)`, `(5, 1)`, `(4, 1)`.\nIs `(7, 1)` safe? Yes, I am moving away from it.\nIs `(6, 1)` safe? Yes.\nIs `(5, 1)` safe? Yes.\nIs `(4, 1)` safe? Yes.\nSo it's safe.\n\nOkay, **UP** is the move.\n\n**Strategy Note:**\nMove UP to (7, 2) to approach the apple at (5, 3). I am currently growing, so my tail remains at (4, 1) this turn. The enemy snake at (9, 3) is not an immediate threat. This path keeps me away from the walls and towards the central apple cluster.\n\nUP",
