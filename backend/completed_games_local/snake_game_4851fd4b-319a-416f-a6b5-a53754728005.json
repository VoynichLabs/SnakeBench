Moving DOWN would also reduce the distance but would place me on the bottom row, limiting my next moves to only LEFT or RIGHT and risking a quick dead\u2011end.  \n\nTherefore, the safest and most flexible choice is to move LEFT, continuing toward the nearest apple while maintaining multiple viable future directions.  \nLEFT",

Safe.\n- **DOWN to (3,2):** Empty cell, within board. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (2,3):** This is my own body segment. Moving into it would kill me. **Not safe.**\n- **RIGHT to (4,3):** Empty cell, within board. Safe.\n\nSo my viable moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\n- **RIGHT (4,3):** Moves away from the cluster of apples. No apple nearby.\n- **UP (3,4):** Moves toward the apples at (1,8) and (1,9), but they are far. Also moves toward (0,4).\n- **DOWN (3,2):** Moves directly toward the apple at (3,0) and also toward the apple at (2,2).\n\n**Enemy consideration:** Enemy snake #0 is at (5,1). Its possible moves are UP to (5,2), DOWN to (5,0), LEFT to (4,1), RIGHT to (6,1). The nearest apple to it is at (3,0) or (2,2). It might move DOWN/LEFT toward (3,0) or UP/LEFT toward (2,2). I should be cautious of a potential head-on collision if we both target the same apple cell.\n\n**Analyzing DOWN (3,2):**\n- This moves me toward (3,0) and (2,2).\n- If enemy moves toward (3,0), a head-on collision is possible if we both end up in the same cell (e.g., (3,1) next turn, or (3,0) eventually). However, this turn, enemy cannot reach (3,2) from (5,1).\n- Moving DOWN gives me a clear path to the apple at (3,0) in two moves (DOWN to (3,2), then DOWN to (3,1), then DOWN to (3,0)), but I must check for enemy interference.\n\n**Analyzing UP (3,4):**\n- This moves me toward the upper apples, but they are farther away. It also keeps me more central.\n- Enemy is unlikely to head that way immediately, so it might be safer from head-on collisions in the short term.\n\n**Analyzing RIGHT (4,3):**\n- This moves me away from most apples, which is not ideal for scoring. It might open up space, but I should prioritize apple collection.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:** After this move, I'll have a body at (3,3). I should continue targeting the nearest safe apple, likely (3,0) or (2,2), while monitoring enemy #0's position to avoid head-on collisions. If I go DOWN now, I can assess next turn whether to continue toward (3,0) or veer toward (2,2) based on enemy movement.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN seems the best as it directly progresses toward two apples while being safe this turn. The risk of head-on collision with the enemy is not immediate this turn, and I can adjust my path next turn based on where the enemy moves.\n\nDOWN",

Wait, the board shows 'A' at (2,2) and my head at (3,2). The apple at (2,2) is still there. I didn't eat it. My last move was DOWN to (3,2). The apple at (3,0) is also still present.\n\n**Safety check from (3,2):**\n- **UP to (3,3):** This is my own body segment. Moving into it would kill me. **Not safe.**\n- **DOWN to (3,1):** Empty cell, within board. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (2,2):** This cell contains an apple. Moving onto an apple is safe (I will grow). Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (4,2):** Empty cell, within board. Safe.\n\nSo viable moves are DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\n- **LEFT (2,2):** Directly onto an apple. I would eat it, grow, and my tail would stay at (3,3) for now? Actually, when you eat an apple, you grow by adding a new segment at the tail next turn. So moving onto (2,2) gives me an apple immediately.\n- **DOWN (3,1):** Moves toward the apple at (3,0).\n- **RIGHT (4,2):** Moves away from apples.\n\n**Enemy snake #0** is at head (4,1) with no body. Its possible moves from (4,1):\n- UP to (4,2)\n- DOWN to (4,0)\n- LEFT to (3,1)\n- RIGHT to (5,1)\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**\n- If I move LEFT to (2,2), enemy cannot reach (2,2) in one move. Safe.\n- If I move DOWN to (3,1), enemy could move LEFT to (3,1) as well, causing a head-on collision. That's a risk.\n- If I move RIGHT to (4,2), enemy could move UP to (4,2), also a head-on collision risk.\n\nSo LEFT to the apple (2,2) has no head-on collision risk this turn, while DOWN and RIGHT both have a potential head-on collision if the enemy chooses the same cell.\n\n**Evaluating DOWN (3,1) risk:** Enemy could go LEFT to (3,1). Is that likely? The enemy might be targeting the apple at (3,0) or (2,2). From (4,1), LEFT to (3,1) is a step toward both (3,0) and (2,2). So it's a plausible move for the enemy.\n\n**Evaluating RIGHT (4,2) risk:** Enemy could go UP to (4,2). That moves it away from the nearest apples, so maybe less likely, but still possible.\n\n**Best move:** LEFT to (2,2) is safe from immediate collision, gets me an apple, and grows my snake. That's clearly advantageous. After eating, my body will be [(3,2), (3,3)] and a new segment will be added at the tail next turn. My head will be at (2,2).\n\n**Long-term plan note:** After eating the apple at (2,2), my next target could be (3,0) or the apples in the top-left. Be aware that enemy #0 is close and may also target (3,0). Avoid moving into (3,1) if the enemy is heading there. Consider moving toward (0,4) or (1,8)/(1,9) to collect more apples while staying away from the enemy if it becomes aggressive.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Looking at the board, my head is at (2,2) after moving LEFT last turn. I just ate the apple at (2,2), so my body is now: head at (2,2), followed by (3,2) and (3,3). I have grown, so my tail will stay at (3,3) for this turn. The apple at (2,2) is now gone.\n\n**Safety check from (2,2):**\n- **UP to (2,3):** Empty cell, within board. Safe.\n- **DOWN to (2,1):** Empty cell, within board. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (1,2):** Empty cell, within board. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (3,2):** This is my own body segment. Moving into it would kill me. **Not safe.**\n\nSo viable moves are UP, DOWN, and LEFT.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\nApples are at: (3,0), (0,4), (1,8), (1,9), (0,1).\n- **DOWN (2,1):** Moves toward (3,0) and (0,1).\n- **LEFT (1,2):** Moves toward (0,4) and the top-left apples (1,8, 1,9).\n- **UP (2,3):** Moves generally upward, but not directly toward any immediate apple.\n\n**Enemy snake #0** is at head (4,0) with no body. Its possible moves from (4,0):\n- UP to (4,1)\n- DOWN is off-board (4,-1) \u2192 would kill it.\n- LEFT to (3,0) \u2192 contains an apple.\n- RIGHT to (5,0) \u2192 empty.\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**\n- If I move DOWN to (2,1), enemy cannot reach (2,1) in one move. Safe.\n- If I move LEFT to (1,2), enemy cannot reach (1,2). Safe.\n- If I move UP to (2,3), enemy cannot reach (2,3). Safe.\n\nSo no immediate head-on collision risk with enemy #0 from any safe move.\n\n**Evaluating best apple target:**\nThe closest apples are (3,0) and (0,1). (3,0) is at risk because enemy #0 might move LEFT to (3,0) to eat it. If I move DOWN to (2,1), I am one step away from (3,0) and also closer to (0,1). However, moving toward (3,0) could lead to a confrontation next turn if the enemy eats it and moves toward me.\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,2) positions me to go toward (0,4) or (0,1) while putting more distance between me and the enemy. The enemy is at (4,0), so moving left seems safer.\n\n**Future mobility:**\nFrom (2,1): possible next moves would be LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN (to (2,0)), UP (back to (2,2) which may be occupied by my growing body? Actually, my body will be [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3)] after this move, so (2,2) will be my neck, which is part of my body. So from (2,1), moving UP back to (2,2) would be into my own body next turn\u2014that's a potential trap. I need to consider that.\n\nFrom (1,2): next moves would be UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. My body will be at (2,2), (3,2), (3,3). So (2,2) is occupied, but (1,1), (1,3), (0,2) are likely free. Good mobility.\n\nFrom (2,3): next moves would be UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. My body will be at (2,2), (3,2), (3,3). So (2,2) is occupied, but (2,4), (1,3), (3,3) are occupied? (3,3) is my tail, but if I grow, it stays. Actually, after eating last turn, my tail stays at (3,3) for this turn, and next turn it will still be there? Wait: growth mechanics: when you eat an apple, you grow by adding a new segment at the tail *next turn*. So this turn (Turn 3), my tail is at (3,3) and I have not yet added a segment. After this move (Turn 4), my tail will remain at (3,3) because I ate an apple last turn? Let's clarify: I ate an apple on Turn 3 (moving onto (2,2)). That means on Turn 4 (this move), my snake will grow: a new segment will be added at the tail, so my tail will stay at (3,3) and my body length increases to 4? Actually, typical Snake: you eat an apple, you grow by one segment at the end of the next move. So after moving on Turn 4, a new segment is added where the tail was, so the tail doesn't move. So after this move, my body will be: head at new position, then (2,2), (3,2), (3,3), and a new segment added at (3,3)? That would double up? Hmm, standard implementation: when you eat, you don't remove the tail on the next move. So if my tail is at (3,3) and I eat an apple, on the next move I move my head, my tail stays put, so my length increases by 1. So after this move, my body will be [new head, (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)] \u2014 length 4. So (3,3) remains occupied.\n\nThus, from (2,3), moving DOWN next turn would go to (2,2) which is my neck \u2014 that would be into my own body and kill me. So (2,3) might limit my options.\n\nGiven that, moving to (2,1) also has a similar issue: moving UP next turn would go to (2,2) which is my neck \u2014 also deadly. So both UP and DOWN from my current head lead to potential self-collision next turn if I reverse direction. However, moving LEFT to (1,2) avoids that because (2,2) is not directly adjacent in the left/right axis? From (1,2), moving RIGHT would go to (2,2) which is my neck \u2014 that would also be deadly. So I must avoid moving back into my neck next turn regardless.\n\nBut for this turn, I should choose a move that maximizes future safe moves. Moving LEFT to (1,2) gives me three adjacent cells: (1,3), (0,2), (1,1). All are likely empty except maybe (0,2) is empty. That seems good.\n\nMoving DOWN to (2,1) gives adjacent cells: (2,0), (1,1), (3,1). (2,0) is empty, (1,1) empty, (3,1) empty. Also three options.\n\nMoving UP to (2,3) gives adjacent cells: (2,4), (1,3), (3,3). (3,3) is my tail (occupied), so only two safe options next turn.\n\nSo UP is less flexible.\n\n**Decision:** Between DOWN and LEFT, both are safe and offer good future mobility. I want to collect apples while avoiding the enemy. The enemy is at (4,0) and likely targets (3,0). If I go DOWN to (2,1), I am closer to (3,0) and might compete with the enemy next turn. If I go LEFT to (1,2), I am moving toward the cluster of apples at (0,4), (1,8), (1,9) and also (0,1), which are farther from the enemy. This seems like a safer long-term strategy to gather apples without confrontation.\n\n**Long-term plan note:** After moving LEFT to (1,2), next turn consider moving toward (0,1) or (0,4) while monitoring enemy #0's position. Avoid moving back into (2,2). If enemy goes for (3,0), let it have it and focus on the top-left apples.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current board, my head is at (1,2). My body segments are at (2,2) and (3,2). I just grew from eating an apple last turn, so my tail will stay at (3,3) for this move, making my full body after this move: [new head, (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (3,3)]? Wait, let's trace carefully.\n\n**Current state (Turn 4):**\n- My head: (1,2)\n- Body: [(2,2), (3,2)]\n- Apples collected: 2\n- Last turn I ate an apple at (2,2) by moving LEFT from (2,2)? Actually, the last rationale says my head was at (2,2) after moving LEFT last turn, and I ate the apple there. So my body was [(3,2), (3,3)] before eating. After eating, I grew, so this turn (Turn 4) my body should be: head at (1,2) (after moving LEFT from (2,2)), then the neck at (2,2), then (3,2), and the tail at (3,3) because the new segment hasn't been added yet? The growth typically means the tail doesn't move on the turn after eating. So my current body length is 4: head (1,2), then (2,2), (3,2), (3,3). Yes, that matches the \"Body: [(2,2), (3,2)]\" in the prompt? That seems inconsistent. The prompt says \"Body: [(2,2), (3,2)]\" which would be length 3 total. But I have 2 apples, so my length should be 3 + apples = 5? Actually, starting length is 3, each apple adds 1. I have 2 apples, so total length = 5. Let's count: head (1,2), plus two body segments listed (2,2) and (3,2), that's only 3 segments. I'm missing two segments. The board shows \"T\" at (3,2) and (2,2)? The board shows my snake as \"1 T T\" at row 2: positions (1,2) is head \"1\", (2,2) is \"T\", (3,2) is \"T\". That's only three segments. But I have 2 apples, so I should have length 5. Something is off. Possibly the board only shows the head and the two immediate body segments? Or maybe growth hasn't been visualized yet. I'll trust the coordinate list in the prompt: my body is only [(2,2), (3,2)]. So my total segments = head + 2 = 3. That means I haven't grown from the last apple yet? But I have 2 apples collected. Starting length is typically 3, so with 2 apples I should be length 5. This is confusing.\n\nGiven the inconsistency, I'll proceed with the provided coordinates: head at (1,2), body at (2,2) and (3,2). So my full snake occupies (1,2), (2,2), (3,2). The tail is at (3,2). The board shows a \"T\" at (3,2) and (2,2), which matches.\n\n**Safety check from (1,2):**\n- **UP to (1,3):** Empty cell (board shows '.' at (1,3)? Row 3, column 1 is '.'). Within board. Safe.\n- **DOWN to (1,1):** Empty cell (row 1, column 1 is '.'). Within board. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (0,2):** Empty cell (row 2, column 0 is '.'). Within board. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (2,2):** This is my own body segment (neck). Moving into it would kill me. **Not safe.**\n\nSo viable moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\nApples at: (0,4), (1,8), (1,9), (0,1), (5,5).\n- **LEFT (0,2):** Moves toward (0,4), (0,1), and the top-left apples (1,8, 1,9) are above.\n- **DOWN (1,1):** Moves toward (0,1) and potentially (5,5) is far.\n- **UP (1,3):** Moves toward (0,4) and the top apples, but less directly.\n\n**Enemy snake #0:** Head at (3,0), body at (4,0). Its possible moves from (3,0):\n- UP to (3,1)\n- DOWN to (3,-1) \u2192 off-board, would die.\n- LEFT to (2,0) \u2192 empty.\n- RIGHT to (4,0) \u2192 its own body, would die.\n\nSo enemy can only move UP or LEFT safely.\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**\n- If I move LEFT to (0,2): enemy cannot reach (0,2) in one move (it's at (3,0)). Safe.\n- If I move DOWN to (1,1): enemy cannot reach (1,1). Safe.\n- If I move UP to (1,3): enemy cannot reach (1,3). Safe.\nNo immediate head-on collision.\n\n**Future mobility:**\nFrom each potential new head position, considering my current body will move: after I move, my body will shift: new head at chosen cell, then the old head (1,2) becomes neck, then (2,2) becomes second body segment, and the tail (3,2) will move? Actually, in Snake, when you move, the tail moves forward one cell into the previous second-to-last segment's old position. Since my body is only three segments long (head, two body), moving will cause the tail to move into the old neck position? Let's simulate:\nCurrent: head (1,2), body [(2,2), (3,2)].\nIf I move LEFT to (0,2):\n- New head: (0,2)\n- Neck: old head (1,2)\n- Second body: old first body (2,2)\n- Tail: old second body (3,2) disappears? Actually, the tail moves to the old position of the second body? Wait, standard Snake: each body segment moves into the position of the segment ahead of it. So after moving, the segment that was at (2,2) moves to (1,2), and the segment that was at (3,2) moves to (2,2). So new body becomes [(1,2), (2,2)]. So occupied cells after move: (0,2), (1,2), (2,2).\n\nSimilarly for other moves:\n- UP to (1,3): new body [(1,2), (2,2)].\n- DOWN to (1,1): new body [(1,2), (2,2)].\n\nSo in all cases, my body after moving will occupy: new head, (1,2), (2,2). The cell (3,2) becomes empty.\n\nNow, evaluate future moves from each new head:\n\n1. **LEFT to (0,2):**\n   Adjacent cells: UP (0,3), DOWN (0,1), RIGHT (1,2). RIGHT is my neck (1,2) which will be occupied. So only UP and DOWN are safe next turn. That's only 2 options.\n\n2. **DOWN to (1,1):**\n   Adjacent cells: UP (1,2) \u2192 neck, occupied; DOWN (1,0); LEFT (0,1); RIGHT (2,1). So three safe options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Good mobility.\n\n3. **UP to (1,3):**\n   Adjacent cells: DOWN (1,2) \u2192 neck, occupied; UP (1,4); LEFT (0,3); RIGHT (2,3). So three safe options (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Good mobility.\n\nBoth DOWN and UP offer 3 safe follow-up moves, while LEFT offers only 2. So LEFT is less flexible.\n\n**Apple targeting:**\n- DOWN (1,1) is closer to apple at (0,1) (Manhattan distance 1) and also moves toward (5,5) in the long run? (5,5) is far.\n- UP (1,3) is closer to apple at (0,4) (distance |1-0|+|3-4|=2) and the top apples (1,8) etc.\n- LEFT (0,2) is equidistant to (0,1) and (0,4) (distance 1 and 2 respectively).\n\nConsidering the enemy: enemy is at (3,0) and likely will move UP to (3,1) or LEFT to (2,0). It might target apple at (0,1) if it goes left and then down? Actually, from (3,0), LEFT to (2,0) then DOWN is off-board, so it can't reach (0,1) quickly. The apple at (0,1) is relatively safe for me to collect.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1,1), I can grab (0,1) next turn by moving LEFT. That's efficient.\n\nIf I go UP to (1,3), I can aim for (0,4) but that's two moves away (LEFT then UP or UP then LEFT). It's also closer to the enemy? No, enemy is far south.\n\n**Long-term plan:** I want to collect apples while maintaining mobility. DOWN seems good because it gives me immediate access to (0,1) and keeps three future directions open. UP also gives three directions but is farther from immediate apples. LEFT limits my future options.\n\n**Decision:** I'll go DOWN to (1,1) to secure the apple at (0,1) next turn and maintain high mobility.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (1,1), consider moving LEFT to (0,1) to eat the apple, unless the enemy moves into that cell (unlikely). Check safety and head-on collisions.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current board, my head is at (1,1). My body segments are at (1,2) and (2,2) (the tail is at (2,2)). The board shows my snake as \"1 T T\" at row 1 and 2, which matches: head at (1,1), body at (1,2) and (2,2). I have collected 2 apples, so my total length should be 5, but the visual only shows 3 segments. I'll trust the provided coordinates: head (1,1), body [(1,2), (2,2)], so my full snake occupies (1,1), (1,2), (2,2). The tail is at (2,2).\n\n**Safety check from (1,1):**\n- **UP to (1,2):** This is my own body segment (neck). Moving into it would kill me. **Not safe.**\n- **DOWN to (1,0):** Empty cell (board shows '.' at (1,0)? Row 0, column 1 is '.'). Within board. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (0,1):** Apple cell (board shows 'A' at (0,1)). Within board. Safe (eating apple).\n- **RIGHT to (2,1):** Empty cell (row 1, column 2 is '.'). Within board. Safe.\n\nSo viable moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\nApples at: (0,4), (1,8), (1,9), (0,1), (5,5).\n- **LEFT (0,1):** Directly onto apple at (0,1). Eating it would grow my length by 1.\n- **DOWN (1,0):** Moves away from most apples, but could later go left to (0,0) or right.\n- **RIGHT (2,1):** Moves toward center and apple at (5,5) but still far.\n\n**Enemy snake #0:** Head at (2,0), body at (3,0). Its possible moves from (2,0):\n- UP to (2,1)\n- DOWN to (2,-1) \u2192 off-board, would die.\n- LEFT to (1,0)\n- RIGHT to (3,0) \u2192 its own body, would die.\nSo enemy can only move UP or LEFT safely.\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**\n- If I move LEFT to (0,1): enemy cannot reach (0,1) in one move (it's at (2,0)). Safe.\n- If I move DOWN to (1,0): enemy could move LEFT to (1,0). That would be a head-on collision if enemy chooses LEFT. That is a risk.\n- If I move RIGHT to (2,1): enemy could move UP to (2,1). That would be a head-on collision if enemy chooses UP. That is a risk.\n\nSo LEFT is safe from head-on collision. DOWN and RIGHT have potential head-on collisions depending on enemy's choice.\n\n**Future mobility after move (considering growth if eating apple):**\n1. **LEFT to (0,1) and eat apple:**\n   After eating, I grow. My new body: head at (0,1), old head (1,1) becomes neck, old body (1,2) becomes second segment, old tail (2,2) becomes third segment, and a new tail segment will be added at the old tail position? Actually, in Snake, when you eat, you grow by not removing the tail on that turn. So after moving, my body will be: new head (0,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (2,2). So length 4. Occupied cells: (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2).\n   Next turn from (0,1): adjacent cells: UP (0,2), DOWN (0,0), RIGHT (1,1). RIGHT is my neck, occupied. So only UP and DOWN are safe. That's only 2 options. Mobility is reduced.\n\n2. **DOWN to (1,0) (no apple):**\n   After moving, my body shifts: head (1,0), neck (1,1), second segment (1,2). Tail (2,2) disappears. Occupied: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2).\n   Next turn from (1,0): adjacent cells: UP (1,1) \u2192 neck, occupied; DOWN (1,-1) \u2192 off-board; LEFT (0,0); RIGHT (2,0). So only LEFT and RIGHT are safe (2 options). Also, DOWN is off-board. So mobility is limited.\n\n3. **RIGHT to (2,1) (no apple):**\n   After moving, body: head (2,1), neck (1,1), second segment (1,2). Occupied: (2,1), (1,1), (1,2).\n   Next turn from (2,1): adjacent cells: UP (2,2) \u2192 empty? (2,2) is currently my tail but will be empty after move; DOWN (2,0) \u2192 currently enemy head? Actually enemy head is at (2,0) now, but will move this turn. If enemy moves away, it might be empty; LEFT (1,1) \u2192 my neck, occupied; RIGHT (3,1). So potentially UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe if DOWN is empty. That could be 3 options if enemy moves away from (2,0). But if enemy stays or moves into (2,0), it's complicated.\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n- LEFT: safe from head-on, but reduces future mobility to 2 directions. However, I get an apple, increasing my score to 3. The enemy has 1 apple, so I extend my lead.\n- DOWN: risk of head-on collision if enemy moves LEFT to (1,0). Even if not, future mobility is only 2 directions (LEFT and RIGHT) and I'm at the bottom edge.\n- RIGHT: risk of head-on collision if enemy moves UP to (2,1). Future mobility could be good if enemy moves away from (2,0).\n\n**Enemy behavior prediction:** Enemy likely wants to avoid dying and get apples. From (2,0), moving UP to (2,1) brings it closer to apples at (0,4) etc., but also risks collision with me if I go RIGHT. Moving LEFT to (1,0) brings it closer to apple at (0,1) but risks collision if I go DOWN. Since the enemy has only 1 apple, it might play cautiously. I cannot be sure.\n\n**Trade-off:** LEFT gives me a guaranteed apple and no collision risk, but limits my next moves. However, after eating, I can reassess. With a longer snake, I need to be careful about trapping myself, but the board is still open.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Secure apples to build a lead. Since the game ends at 50 apples or 150 turns, accumulating apples is key. I have a lead (2 vs 1), so extending it is good. LEFT is the only move that guarantees an apple this turn without collision risk.\n\n**Decision:** I'll go LEFT to (0,1) to eat the apple. This increases my score to 3 and avoids immediate collision dangers. Next turn, I'll have to navigate from (0,1) with limited options, but I can plan then.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (0,1) after eating, my body will be at (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2). My possible moves will be UP to (0,2) or DOWN to (0,0). I should choose the direction that keeps me safe and moves toward another apple (e.g., UP toward (0,4) or DOWN toward bottom-left area). I'll need to check enemy position and avoid dead ends.\n\nLEFT",

It also does not change our x\u2011coordinate, so we remain on the right side of the board where fewer apples are reachable.  \n\nConsidering apple proximity, future maneuverability, and the risk of running into the opponent\u2019s body, the best choice is to move LEFT.  \nLEFT",

Its possible moves from (1,0):\n- UP to (1,1)\n- DOWN to (1,-1) \u2192 off-board, would die.\n- LEFT to (0,0)\n- RIGHT to (2,0) \u2192 its own body, would die.\nSo enemy can only move UP or LEFT safely.\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**\n- If I move UP to (0,2): enemy cannot reach (0,2) in one move (it's at (1,0)). Safe.\n- If I move DOWN to (0,0): enemy could move LEFT to (0,0). That would be a head-on collision if enemy chooses LEFT. That is a risk.\n\n**Future mobility after move:**\n1. **UP to (0,2) (no apple):**\n   After moving, my body shifts: head (0,2), neck (0,1), second segment (1,1), third segment (1,2). Tail (2,2) disappears. Occupied: (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2).\n   Next turn from (0,2): adjacent cells: UP (0,3), DOWN (0,1) \u2192 my neck, occupied; LEFT (-1,2) off-board; RIGHT (1,2) \u2192 my body segment. So only UP is safe (1 option). That's very limiting and could trap me.\n\n2. **DOWN to (0,0) (no apple):**\n   After moving, body: head (0,0), neck (0,1), second segment (1,1), third segment (1,2). Occupied: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2).\n   Next turn from (0,0): adjacent cells: UP (0,1) \u2192 my neck, occupied; DOWN (0,-1) off-board; LEFT (-1,0) off-board; RIGHT (1,0) \u2192 currently enemy head? Enemy will move this turn. If enemy moves away, it might be empty. So potentially only RIGHT is safe if (1,0) becomes empty. That's also very limiting.\n\nBoth moves severely restrict my next move. However, moving UP at least keeps me closer to the apple at (0,4) and gives me a chance to continue upward along the left edge. Moving DOWN puts me in a corner with only one potential exit (RIGHT), but that cell (1,0) is currently occupied by the enemy head. If the enemy moves away (e.g., UP to (1,1) or LEFT to (0,0) which would cause a head-on collision with me if I go DOWN), then (1,0) might become free. But if I move DOWN and the enemy moves LEFT, we collide and both die. That's a risk I should avoid since I have an apple lead (3 vs 1).\n\n**Enemy behavior prediction:** From (1,0), enemy likely wants to avoid dying and get apples. Moving UP to (1,1) is safe (it's my body, but moving into another snake's body kills the mover, so enemy would die if it goes to (1,1)). Actually, (1,1) is my body segment. If enemy moves UP into (1,1), it dies. So enemy's only truly safe move is LEFT to (0,0) if it wants to live. But if I move DOWN to (0,0), that's a head-on collision. If I move UP, enemy might still choose LEFT to (0,0) to avoid dying, which is safe for it.\n\nGiven my apple lead, I should prioritize survival. Moving DOWN risks a head-on collision if enemy goes LEFT. Moving UP has no collision risk and keeps me alive, even though my next move will be limited to UP only. From (0,2) next turn, I can go UP to (0,3), then to (0,4) to get the apple. That path seems clear: (0,3) and (0,4) are currently empty. My body will trail behind me, but I need to ensure I don't trap myself. After eating the apple at (0,4), I'll grow and my tail will extend, but I'll be at the top-left edge. I'll need to plan an escape route, perhaps turning right afterward.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move UP this turn to (0,2). Next turn, move UP to (0,3) if safe. Then move UP to (0,4) to eat the apple. After that, consider turning RIGHT toward the center to avoid getting trapped in the corner. Keep an eye on enemy movements.\n\nUP",
