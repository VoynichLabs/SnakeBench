          "rationale": "Ayo, what is UP, chat! We're back, we're live, and we're ready to absolutely dismantle our opponent, Snake #0! Look at this board, 10x10, and we're starting fresh, turn 0! This is where dreams are made, folks! \ud83e\udd29\n\nWe're sitting pretty at (6, 5), and our archrival, Snake #0, is at (1, 3). We have a huge advantage in positioning right now, near a bunch of potential apples down the line. We need to capitalize on this immediately!\n\n### 1. Analyze the Immediate Danger (Safety First!)\n\nOur head is at (6, 5). We are currently only 1 segment long.\n*   **UP (to 6, 6):** Safe. Looks juicy, there's an apple at (6, 6)! \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **DOWN (to 6, 4):** Safe. Open space.\n*   **LEFT (to 5, 5):** Safe. Looks juicy, there's an apple at (5, 5)! \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **RIGHT (to 7, 5):** Safe. Open space.\n\nAll four moves are currently safe from self-collision or going off-board. Now, let's consider the enemy, Snake #0 at (1, 3).\n\n### 2. Analyze Opponent's Moves & Collision Potential\n\nSnake #0 is way over on the left side. They are focused on the cluster around (0, 3) and (1, 3). Their possible next moves are:\n*   (1, 4) - UP\n*   (1, 2) - DOWN\n*   (0, 3) - LEFT (Apple!)\n*   (2, 3) - RIGHT\n\nAt an initial manhattan distance of |6-1| + |5-3| = 5 + 2 = 7, there is absolutely zero chance of a head-on collision this turn. Phew! We can focus purely on apples and positioning.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Apple Opportunities & Strategy\n\nOur main objective right now is GROWTH and securing territory. We have two immediate apples we can reach:\n1.  **UP** to (6, 6).\n2.  **LEFT** to (5, 5).\n\nBoth are fantastic moves. Which one gives us better future access and control?\n\n*   **Moving UP (6, 6):** We grab the apple. Future moves include (6, 7) (open), (7, 6) (open), or (5, 6) (open). This keeps us elevated and near the center-right of the board. There are future apples at (8, 2) and (9, 8) that are somewhat far, but also closer apples like (9, 8) eventually. More importantly, it gives us central control.\n*   **Moving LEFT (5, 5):** We grab the apple. Future moves include (5, 6) (open), (4, 5) (open, but leading toward the clustered left side), or (6, 5) (returning to original spot, which is now our body *if* we succeed). This pulls us towards the center-left. This area has fewer immediate apples nearby than the central column does.\n\nThe **UP** move to (6, 6) seems slightly superior for establishing central control and accessing the rest of the board easily. Look at the terrain:\nIf we go UP to (6, 6), we are directly in line with (0, 7) and (9, 8) (eventually). We are also in a good position to drop down towards (8, 2) or cut left later.\n\nLet's commit to the high ground! Secure the apple at (6, 6) and assert dominance in the middle column.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy Note\n\n**Plan:** Prioritize eating the immediate apples near the center (6, 6) and (5, 5) while extending our length. Once we are longer, start maneuvering towards Snake #0's territory to limit their options, perhaps aiming to cut off the bottom-left cluster where they are currently dwelling (*cough* (0, 0), (2, 0), (0, 3)). Right now, safety and growth are key. We aim to be at least 3 segments long before attempting any aggressive moves.\n\nWe're going UP, snagging that apple, and setting the stage for a dominating game! Can I get an F in the chat for our opponent? They're about to get boxed! \ud83d\udce6\ud83e\udd4a\n\nUP",

Gotta play this smart from the jump! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nCHECKING MY MOVES:\n- **UP** to (1,4): Open space, no immediate danger. \u2705\n- **DOWN** to (1,2): Also open, but that's moving away from most of the apples. \u2753\n- **LEFT** to (0,3): APPLE ALERT! \ud83c\udf4e But wait... is it safe? That's an apple drop at (0,3). Moving there would eat it and grow. But we gotta check if Snake #1 can also get there... he's far away at (6,5). This seems FREE. \u2705\n- **RIGHT** to (2,3): Open space, but no apple. \u2705\n\nSo all four moves are SAFE. No risk of crashing. But which one gives us the biggest advantage? \ud83e\udd14\n\nLEFT to (0,3) gets us an APPLE on turn 1! That's content, that's growth, that's putting pressure on the opponent immediately. It's on the edge of the board, but we're not trapped yet. We can go UP or DOWN from there next turn.\n\nSnake #1 is way over on the right side. He can't contest this apple. This is a freebie! Gotta take those early leads.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Snag this easy apple on the left wall. Then work our way up the left side towards the cluster of apples near the top-left. Force Snake #1 to come to us in our territory. Let him navigate the center while we control the edges.\n\nLEFT",

That's what I call a power start. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nOur head is now at (6, 6) and our tail is at (6, 5) (which was our previous head). Let's check out what the opponent, Snake #0, did.\nSnake #0 started at (0, 3) and had an apple at (0, 3)! They took the apple and moved LEFT. Smart move, grabbing that early growth near the wall. Their head is now at (0, 3) and their body is at (1, 3). So they are also 2 segments long. We are tied 1-1 in apples, but we've got the positional advantage!\n\nThe current board state shows new apples have spawned too (though technically the display shows the *initial* drop locations, and (6,6) and (0,3) are now gone, replaced by our body segments). The key is the remaining apples.\n\n### 1. Identify Immediate Threats & Safety Checks\n\nOur head is at (6, 6). Our body segment is at (6, 5).\n\n*   **UP (to 6, 7):** Safe. Open space. There's an apple at (0, 7) (far).\n*   **DOWN (to 6, 5):** **DANGER!** This is our body! We crash out! ELIMINATED. \u274c\n*   **LEFT (to 5, 6):** Safe. Open space. Very close to an apple at (5, 5).\n*   **RIGHT (to 7, 6):** Safe. Open space.\n\nThree safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nWhat about Snake #0? They are at (0, 3).\nTheir moves could be:\n*   (0, 4) - UP\n*   (0, 2) - DOWN\n*   (1, 3) - RIGHT (Their body is at (1, 3), so they would die if they moved RIGHT!)\n\nWait, HUGE realization, chat! Snake #0's head is at (0, 3) and their body is at (1, 3). If they move RIGHT, they move into (1, 3) and crash out immediately! No way they make that mistake.\nSo their only truly safe moves are UP (0, 4) or DOWN (0, 2). They are completely cornered by the wall and their own body segment.\n\n**Collision Check:** We are at (6, 6) and they are at (0, 3). Manhattan distance is 9. No chance of a head-on collision.\n\n### 2. Apple Evaluation and Positional Strategy\n\nThe goal is growth, but also territory. We have the center right. Snake #0 is stuck on the left wall.\n\n**Key Apples in Range:**\n1.  **(5, 5):** Very close, 1 move away via LEFT + DOWN. This is the nearest untaken apple.\n2.  **(8, 2):** Somewhat far, but central territory focus.\n3.  **(9, 8):** Far.\n\nLet's evaluate our safe moves again:\n\n*   **Move UP to (6, 7):** This keeps us high and central. Good for securing the top-center lane. Next turn we could go (6, 8) or (7, 7). It costs us an immediate apple opportunity, pushing us further from (5, 5).\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 6):** This pulls us toward the right wall. Also delays getting (5, 5). Good defensive move if we were being challenged, but we aren't.\n*   **Move LEFT to (5, 6):** This is the key strategic move. It positions us perfectly to grab the apple at (5, 5) next turn if we go DOWN, or maintain height if we go UP/LEFT. It directly moves us toward the nearest objective.\n\nMoving **LEFT** (to 5, 6) puts us one step closer to the apple at (5, 5). This is the most efficient apple grab.\n\n### 3. Strategy and Future Moves (The Box Plan)\n\nWe need to extend our length to at least 4 before we start moving to box in Snake #0. They are already essentially self-boxed on the left wall for the next few moves. We should just focus on growth and securing the rest of the available apples.\n\n**Plan for next 2 turns:**\n1.  T1: Move LEFT (to 5, 6). Position for (5, 5).\n2.  T2: Move DOWN (to 5, 5). Grab the apple! We'll be 3 segments long.\n\nSnake #0 is stuck between (0, 4) and (0, 2). They have very limited options and are unlikely to challenge our territory soon. We're going for maximum growth efficiency!\n\nLEFT\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** Focus on grabbing (5, 5) and then the apples in the (3, 2) / (3, 3) region. Once we reach 4-5 segments, we will use our length to secure the lower half of the board and cut off Snake #0 from any future lower apple clusters like (0, 0) or (2, 0). Snake #0's small corner limits their immediate growth, giving us a length advantage to control the board.\n\nLEFT",

There's an apple at (0,0) way down there. Might be a long trek. From (0,2), next moves could be RIGHT or UP. DOWN seems a bit limiting.\n\n*   **UP:** To (0,4). Is it safe?\n    - On the board? YES.\n    - Into my body? NO.\n    - Into enemy? NO.\n    \u2705 SAFE MOVE. HEY! There's an apple RIGHT ABOVE US at (0,4)! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e That's an immediate eat! This is huge! From (0,4), we'd have UP (to more apples at (0,6), (0,7)) or RIGHT available next turn. This is aggressive growth!\n\n*   **RIGHT:** To (1,3). Is it safe?\n    - On the board? YES.\n    - Into my body? ... WAIT. HOLD UP. \ud83d\udea8 My body segment is currently at (1,3). Moving RIGHT would put my head directly into my own neck! That's moving backwards into myself! INSTANT DEATH. \u274c\u274c\u274c NO WAY. THROWING IS NOT AN OPTION.\n\nSO OUR ONLY SAFE MOVES ARE **DOWN** and **UP**.\n\nTHE CHOICE IS CLEAR, CHAT! UP gets us an APPLE IMMEDIATELY, extends our lead to 2-1, and sets us up on a path along the left wall with MORE APPLES in sight. DOWN just avoids death but doesn't progress our game plan. We're here to WIN, not just survive.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Go UP, eat the apple at (0,4). Next turn, assess. We can likely go UP again towards (0,5) and then (0,6) for another apple. We're claiming the left side as our territory. Force Snake #1 to deal with the center and right side. We'll get big and then look to cut him off!\n\nUP",

Time to catch up!\n\nLet's check the current board state and our location.\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (5, 6)\n*   Body: [(6, 6)]\n*   We're currently 2 segments long.\n\nThe move last turn was LEFT, so we moved from (6, 6) to (5, 6), and our old head (6, 6) is now our body. Wait, the *display* showed an error last turn in my analysis, but the *actual* game state is that my body is at (6, 6), and my head is at (5, 6). This is correct based on our LEFT movement. The tail is the last segment, so the chain is (5, 6) [Head] -> (6, 6) [Tail]. Perfect.\n\n**OPPONENT CHECK (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (0, 4)\n*   Body: [(0, 3), (1, 3)]\n*   They moved UP from (0, 3) to (0, 4). They are 3 segments long! Wait, WHAT?! Snake #0 is 3 segments long! They ate two apples! We are behind in length! This changes everything, chat!\n\nSnake #0 started at (0, 3) and ate an apple. Turn 1 (last turn), their head was at (0, 3), and body was at (1, 3). If they moved UP to (0, 4), they must have also eaten another apple or had a segment already.\n\nLet's reconstruct Snake #0's moves vs Apples:\n*   Turn 0: Snake #0 starts at (0, 3). Apple was at (0, 3). They move into it. New state: Head (0, 3), Body (1, 3). Length 2. Apples 1.\n*   Turn 1: New apple at (0, 4)? No, the list shows (0, 0), (8, 2)... no (0, 4). Their head at (0, 3). If they moved UP, they went to (0, 4).\n*   If they are 3 segments long, they ate an apple on Turn 1! Let's check the apple list again. No apple at (0, 4) or (1, 4) etc.\n\n**AH HA!** The scoreboard says Snake #0 has **2 apples.** They must have eaten the apple that was at (0, 3) on Turn 0 (getting to length 2), and then eaten another apple that spawned adjacent to them on Turn 1 (getting to length 3).\n\nLet's look at the current board and assume they were at (0, 3) last turn:\nIf they moved UP from (0, 3) to (0, 4), and they are length 3:\nHead (0, 4), Body (0, 3), Tail (1, 3).\n\nOkay, they are 3 segments long, we are 2 segments long. We need to catch up!\n\n### 1. Safety and Immediate Moves (Your Head at (5, 6))\n\n**Safe Moves Check:**\n\n*   **UP (to 5, 7):** Safe. Apple at (0, 7) (far).\n*   **DOWN (to 5, 5):** **APPLE!** Immediate opportunity! Safe.\n*   **LEFT (to 4, 6):** Safe. Open space.\n*   **RIGHT (to 6, 6):** **DANGER!** This is our body/tail! We crash out! \u274c\n\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### 2. Opponent Threat Assessment (Snake #0 at (0, 4))\n\nSnake #0 is at (0, 4), length 3. Body: (0, 3), (1, 3).\nTheir safe moves:\n*   UP (to 0, 5) - Safe. Heading towards (0, 6) apple.\n*   DOWN (to 0, 3) - **DANGER!** Into their own body segment! \u274c\n*   LEFT (to -1, 4) - **DANGER!** Off the board! \u274c\n*   RIGHT (to 1, 4) - Safe. Moving away from the corner.\n\nOpponent's only good moves are UP to (0, 5) or RIGHT to (1, 4). They are still somewhat boxed by the wall.\n\n**Collision Check:** We are at (5, 6). They are at (0, 4). Minimal threat of head-on collision.\n\n### 3. Apple Strategy (We Need Growth!)\n\nWe made the move LEFT last turn specifically to position ourselves for the apple at (5, 5)! We gotta secure that bag, chat!\n\nThe move **DOWN to (5, 5)**:\n*   Gets us +1 apple, tying the score 2-2.\n*   Increases our length to 3, tying the length!\n*   Sets us up centrally for the next turn.\n\nThis move is incredibly strong. We must take it.\n\n**Future Planning (Post-Apple Grab):**\nAfter grabbing (5, 5), our head will be at (5, 5), body at (5, 6), (6, 6). We'll be in the middle of the board.\n\nIf we go DOWN:\nNext turn, we could go toward the (3, 3) apple or (3, 2) apple.\n\nWhat is Snake #0 likely to do?\n*   Option A: Move UP to (0, 5). They are trying to get to the (0, 6) or (0, 7) apples.\n*   Option B: Move RIGHT to (1, 4). They are trying to escape the wall and come into the open board.\n\nIf they move RIGHT, they are still far away. If they move UP, they are focused on the top-left quadrant.\n\nOur priority is getting growth and solidifying our dominant position on the right/center.\n\nThe move **DOWN** is the only logical choice here. Maximized efficiency, growth, and control. Let's send it!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** Use the length gained from (5, 5) to secure the central apples (3, 2), (3, 3). We want to create a wall horizontally across the middle of the board (y=3 or y=4) to cut off Snake #0, who is trapped on the left, from the remaining lower apples at (0, 0) and (2, 0). Length advantage is crucial for boxing.\n\nDOWN",

This is the PATH TO VICTORY!\n\n**STRATEGY TIME!**\n\nWe're dominating the left side! Snake #1 is stuck on the right.

Once we're a giant, we can turn right and start cutting off the board, trapping Snake #1 against the walls. HE WON'T KNOW WHAT HIT HIM! This is how we WIN!\n\nRIGHT is safe, but it abandons our apple feast and puts us in the open. UP continues our aggressive growth and territory control. It's the OBVIOUS play!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** We're going ALL IN on the left side strategy! UP towards those apples! LET'S GET THIS BREAD... I MEAN, THESE APPLES! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

Game State Review (Turn 3 / 150)\n\n**The Good News:** We moved DOWN and hit the apple at (5, 5)! LET'S GOOO!\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (5, 5)\n*   Body: [(5, 6), (6, 6)] -> Length 3!\n*   Apples collected: 2!\n*   We are now tied on apples and length with Snake #0! This is HUGE!\n\n**OPPONENT CHECK (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (0, 5)\n*   Body: [(0, 4), (0, 3)] -> Length 3!\n*   Apples: 2.\n\nWait, Snake #0 moved UP! They were at (0, 4), and now they are at (0, 5). They are sticking to the wall, trying to grab those top-left apples at (0, 6) and (0, 7). Smart, but predictable, chat!\n\n**Board Overview:** We are centrally dominant. They are cornered. The plan to push them into a corner is still viable!\n\n### 2. Immediate Move Analysis (Head at 5, 5)\n\nWe are at (5, 5). Length 3. What are our options?\n\n*   **UP (to 5, 6):** Safe. But it is our body segment! We just moved there. **DANGER!** Wait, is it the *tail* that is moving? Since we just ate an apple, our tail did *not* disappear. The body list is [(5, 6), (6, 6)]. Moving UP into (5, 6) is instant death! \u274c\n*   **DOWN (to 5, 4):** Safe. Open space. Leads towards the bottom apples.\n*   **LEFT (to 4, 5):** Safe. Open space. This is a direct vector towards Snake #0's lane, which is interesting for boxing.\n*   **RIGHT (to 6, 5):** Safe. Open space.\n\nWe have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### 3. Strategic Considerations: Boxing the Rival\n\nSnake #0 is at (0, 5). They are 3 segments long.\nTheir safe moves:\n*   UP (to 0, 6): **APPLE!** They will absolutely try to grab this.\n*   RIGHT (to 1, 5): Safe. Allows them to escape the wall.\n*   DOWN (to 0, 4): **DANGER!** Into their body (0, 4) segment! \u274c\n*   LEFT (to -1, 5): **DANGER!** Wall crash! \u274c\n\nThey are definitely going to move UP to (0, 6) for that apple, or RIGHT to open up the board. Since the (0, 6) apple is right there, 99% chance they go UP. We need to counter their expansion!\n\nIf they go UP: Head (0, 6), Body [(0, 5), (0, 4)]. Length 4.\n\n**Our Goal:** Get to the side of Snake #0 and start walling them off from the rest of the board. The cluster of apples at (3, 2), (3, 3), (2, 0), (0, 0) is vulnerable right now. We must block them from reaching the center/bottom, forcing them up the left wall.\n\n**Option A: Go LEFT (to 4, 5)**\nThis puts us at (4, 5). It's a proactive move toward the center-left. We are positioned well to jump on the (3, 3) or (3, 2) apples next turn, and we are threatening their escape route (1, 5).\n\n*   If they move UP to (0, 6), we move LEFT to (4, 5). Next turn, we can go LEFT again to (3, 5) or DOWN to (4, 4). This secures a solid vertical line of control.\n\n**Option B: Go DOWN (to 5, 4)**\nThis sets us up for the lower apples, specifically (8, 2) or (2, 0). (5, 4) is a great neutral spot.\n\n*   This is a strong move for pure apple gathering, but less beneficial for the anti-rival boxing strategy. We want to maximize the length/control lead early.\n\n**Option C: Go RIGHT (to 6, 5)**\nPuts us too far away from the opponent right now. Pass.\n\n**The Boxing Strategy (Focus on LEFT):**\n\nIf we move LEFT to (4, 5), and Snake #0 moves UP to (0, 6) and eats the apple, we close the distance.\nNext turn (T4):\n*   We could move DOWN to (4, 4), then RIGHT/DOWN toward (3, 3).\n*   Or we could move LEFT again to (3, 5). This positions us right next to the (3, 3) apple and effectively creates a wall around x=4/x=5, preventing Snake #0 from using the center columns (x=3, x=4, x=5).\n\nWe need to force them to continue moving up the wall towards (9, 9) where the game ends!\n\nGoing LEFT (4, 5) is the most aggressive and strategic move to implement the long-term plan: **Box Snake #0 into the top-left quadrant.** It puts us in contention for the next round of central apples.\n\nLet's do it! We are moving into position to cut off their lines of retreat, chat! Time to get hostile!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T4/T5):** Push LEFT aggressively to x=3, then use DOWN movements to grab the internal apples (3, 3) and (3, 2), while extending our body horizontally across the board to create a barrier at y=4 or y=3. Snake #0 will be forced to keep going UP along the left wall. The more length we get, the tighter that box becomes!\n\nLEFT",

UP is safe, gets us an apple, grows our body, and continues our plan of claiming the left wall! WE BECOME A BIGGER THREAT! WE BOX HIM IN LATER!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** After eating the apple at (0,6), we'll be EVEN LONGER. We'll likely go UP again to (0,7) for another apple, or maybe start a right turn to control more space. But first, LET'S FEAST!\n\nWE'RE STAYING AGGRESSIVE! THIS IS HOW WE WIN! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nUP",

Game State Review (Turn 4 / 150)\n\n**YOUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (4, 5) - *We successfully moved LEFT last turn!*\n*   Body: [(5, 5), (5, 6)]\n*   Length: 3.\n*   Apples collected: 2.\n\n**OPPONENT CHECK (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (0, 6) - *They went UP and grabbed the apple!

We need to catch up, and FAST!\n\n**BOARD STATE (Visual Review):**\n 9 . . A . A . . . . .\n 8 . . A . . . . . . A\n 7 A . . . . . . . . A\n 6 0 . . . . T . . . A  <- Snake 0 is at (0, 6)\n 5 T .

Immediate Move Analysis (Head at 4, 5)\n\nWe are at (4, 5). Length 3. Segment (5, 5) is part of our body. Since we didn't eat an apple last turn, our tail (which was at (6, 6)) moved into (5, 6).\n\n*   **UP (to 4, 6):** Safe. Open space. High ground!\n*   **DOWN (to 4, 4):** Safe. Open space. Leads toward central apples (3, 3), (3, 2).\n*   **LEFT (to 3, 5):** Safe. Open space. APPLE at (3, 3) and (3, 2) are nearby! This continues the boxing strategy.\n*   **RIGHT (to 5, 5):** **DANGER!** Instant crash into our body segment! \u274c\n\nWe have three great safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### 3. Strategic Considerations: Catch-up Mode and Boxing\n\nSnake #0 is at (0, 6). They are long (L=4).\nTheir safe moves (T4 Evasion):\n*   UP (to 0, 7): APPLE available at (0, 7). Very likely.\n*   RIGHT (to 1, 6): Safe. Escape route.\n*   DOWN (to 0, 5): **DANGER!** Into body segment (0, 5)! \u274c\n*   LEFT (to -1, 6): **DANGER!** Wall crash! \u274c\n\nThey essentially have two smart choices: UP for the apple, or RIGHT for freedom. Given how aggressively they went for (0, 6), they will likely go UP to (0, 7).\n\n**Hypothesis: Snake #0 moves UP to (0, 7) and gets Apple #4.**\n\nIf they do that, they are even more locked into the left wall. We need to capitalize on the open center!\n\n**Option A: Go LEFT (to 3, 5)** - *The Boxer*\n*   Pros: Continues the strategic push towards the left side, securing the control line at x=3. Positions us directly above the (3, 3) apple and one turn away from (2, 5) and (2, 8). If Snake #0 tries to move RIGHT to escape via (1, 6), we are perfectly positioned to cut off their movement towards the central board, forcing them to take dangerous turns or stay stuck high.\n*   Cons: We don't grab an apple this turn, allowing them to potentially extend their lead to 4-2.\n\n**Option B: Go DOWN (to 4, 4)** - *The Apple Hunter*\n*   Pros: Sets up perfectly for the (3, 3) apple in a turn or two (move to 3, 4, then 3, 3). This is the fastest way to get an apple and catch up in length (L=5).\n*   Cons: Temporarily moves us away from the opponent, easing the pressure.\n\n**Option C: Go UP (to 4, 6)** - *The Neutralizer*\n*   Pros: Gets us closer to the (4, 9) apple and keeps us centrally relevant.\n*   Cons: Least impactful for both boxing and immediate apple access.\n\n**Decision: We must balance apple hunting with containment.**\n\nIf we go LEFT (3, 5), and the opponent goes UP (0, 7), they are at L=5, A=4. We are at L=3, A=2. Big deficit.\n\nHowever, moving LEFT (3, 5) secures a better position than moving DOWN (4, 4) because it's slightly more central and controls the space between the opponent and the center apples. From (3, 5), we can immediately attack (3, 3) or (2, 5) next turn (T5).\n\nLet's look T5 moves from (3, 5):\n1.  DOWN to (3, 4) -> Towards (3, 3) apple.\n2.  LEFT to (2, 5) -> APPLE! This is huge!\n\nIf we choose LEFT now (to 3, 5), we position ourselves perfectly to grab the (2, 5) apple next turn! This is critical for closing the length and score gap!\n\n**Plan Refined:** Aggressively move to (3, 5) to claim the central territory and set up for the (2, 5) apple grab (T5). This both catches us up and reinforces the containment wall we are building at x=3 and x=4.\n\nWe need to close that gap, chat! Speed is king! Securing (2, 5) next turn gets us to L=4, A=3\u2014back in the race!\n\n**Long-term Strategy (T5/T6):** Move LEFT to (3, 5), then go DOWN/LEFT to (2, 5) to eat the apple. Then, move to (2, 8) and (2, 9) to secure the column while the opponent is still stuck on the left wall.\n\nLet's execute the cut-off and apple grab maneuver!\n\nLEFT",

Our NEXT move from (0,7) would HAVE to be RIGHT, because UP is off the board and DOWN is into our own new, longer body. So it commits us.\n\n*   **RIGHT:** Moves us away from the apples *for now*, but gives us SO MANY OPTIONS! From (1,6) we can go UP, RIGHT, or DOWN next turn. We start to CONTROL MORE SPACE and maybe cut off Snake #1 from the top left!\n\n**WHAT IS SNAKE #1 GONNA DO?**\nHis head is at (4,5). He might go LEFT to (3,5) towards the center apples, or UP to (4,6), or DOWN to (4,4). Is there any world where he ends up at (1,6) or (0,7) this turn? NO WAY. Too far. So both our moves are safe from head-on collision.\n\n**THE VERDICT:** UP is TEMPTING for the quick content... but RIGHT is the GENIUS MOVE! It gives us FLEXIBILITY! We don't want to get pinned on the wall. We want to MANEUVER and eventually BOX HIM IN! By going right, we threaten to dominate the center and trap him! THIS IS LONG-TERM DOMINANCE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** Head towards (1,6). From there, we can swing up to grab the apples at (2,8), (2,9) or even cut off Snake #1's access. We become a moving wall! He's gonna be stuck in the bottom right while we control the board! THIS IS HOW CHAMPIONS THINK!\n\nLET'S MAKE THE SMART PLAY! AGGRESSIVE BUT CALCULATED!\n\nRIGHT",

Sets up for (1, 1) apple.\n*   **Snake #0 LEFT (to 0, 6):** **DANGER!** Crash into their own body! \u274c\n*   **Snake #0 RIGHT (to 2, 6):** Safe. Aggressive move toward the center. This is the most dangerous move for us as it puts them in front of our path.\n\n**Scenario: Collision Check**\n\nIf we move LEFT (to 2, 5) and they move RIGHT (to 2, 6), there is no head-to-head collision. They are at (2, 6), we are at (2, 5). We get the apple! EZ CLAP!\n\nIf we move LEFT (to 2, 5) and they move DOWN (to 1, 5) or UP (to 1, 7), we still get the apple safely.\n\nThe only way we crash is if they went to (3, 5) last turn (which they didn't, they are at 1, 6) and then moved into (2, 5), but that would require them to move LEFT from (3, 5) which is impossible because their head is at (1, 6).\n\nWait, let's look at the proximity.\nOur move: (3, 5) -> (2, 5) (APPLE!)\nTheir potential moves: (1, 6) -> (2, 6), (1, 7), or (1, 5).\n\nWe are moving into a vacant square with an apple. There is virtually no risk of collision this turn!\n\n### 4. Strategic Implications\n\nBy moving LEFT to (2, 5):\n1.  **SCORE/LENGTH:** We gain an apple and grow to L=4, A=3. We eliminate the length deficit and cut the score deficit down to zero! HYPE!\n2.  **POSITIONING:** We now own the x=2 column, right next to the opponent's main escape routes. From (2, 5), we can immediately threaten the (2, 8) and (2, 9) apples, or we can move down and cut off the bottom half of the opponent if they try to move further right.\n\nThis is a no-brainer, chat! We secure the bag and get into prime boxing position! We are turning the tables!\n\n**Long-term Plan (T6-T8):** After eating the (2, 5) apple:\nIf Snake #0 goes far right (e.g., to 2, 6), we should continue UP the x=2 column to grab (2, 8) and (2, 9) (The Wall Builder strategy). This traps them hard against the left wall.\nIf Snake #0 stays low (e.g., 1, 5), we might move to (2, 4) and then (3, 3) to grab another apple and solidify our defense behind them.\n\nBut for now... the apple must be secured! Let's get this $A$ P P L E!\n\nLEFT",

NO. \u2705\n    - BONUS: Gets us closer to those JUICY apples at (2,8), (2,9)! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**STRATEGIC POKER FACE TIME! \ud83c\udccf** WHAT IS SNAKE #1 GONNA DO??\nHis head is at (3,5). He's probably eyeing that apple at (3,3) DOWN or (1,1) LEFT/DOWN. But he could also come UP to (3,6) to try and cut us off from the top! \ud83e\udd14 He's SHORTER, so he's more agile! We gotta be smart!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nWe need to DOMINATE THE TOP LEFT! Those apples are OUR BUFFET! But we can't just charge in blindly! If we go UP to (1,7), our next move is likely RIGHT to (2,7) to get the apples. But what if Snake #1 moves up to (3,6) and then RIGHT to (4,6)? He's not in our way YET...\n\nHOLD UP! \ud83d\udea8 Let's think about CORNERING HIM! If we go RIGHT to (2,6), we position ourselves to potentially swing DOWN and BLOCK his access to the left side of the board! We can become a WALL! He's stuck near the bottom with fewer apples! That's how we WIN!\n\nBUT WAIT CHAT... is DOWN the sneaky play? \ud83e\udd2b (1,5) is safe. From there, we could go RIGHT to (2,5) which has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e We grab a quick snack and then we're in a great position to move UP and contest the center! This also avoids a potential head-on collision if he goes UP to (3,6) looking for us!\n\n**THE VERDICT:** UP gets us closer to the big prize but might be predictable. RIGHT is aggressive for board control. BUT DOWN... DOWN is the GALAXY BRAIN MOVE! \ud83d\udca1 It's unexpected, it secures an immediate apple next turn, and it keeps us fluid! We're not getting pinned! We're playing the long game! FROM (1,5) WE CONTROL THE BOARD!\n\nLET'S MAKE THE SMART, UNPREDICTABLE PLAY! AGGRESSIVE BUT CALCULATED! KEEP HIM GUESSING!\n\nDOWN",

Now it's time to build the BOX! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n### 1. Game State Reassessment (Turn 6 / 150)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (2, 5)\n*   Body: [(3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5)]\n*   Length: 4.\n*   Apples collected: 3. We are in prime position now!\n\n**OPPONENT CHECK (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (1, 5) - *They moved DOWN from (1, 6)! Smart, they are trying to break free towards the bottom, potentially aiming for the (1, 1) apple.*\n*   Body: [(1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5)]\n*   Length: 4.\n*   Apples: 3.\n\n**BOARD STATE (Visual Review - Current Turn Start):**\n 9 . .

Immediate Move Analysis (Head at 2, 5)\n\nWe are at (2, 5). We are ready to make the aggressive move!\n\n*   **UP (to 2, 6):** Safe. Open space. Directly threatens the opponent's body segment (1, 6). If they move down again, we could potentially box them in. Also close to (2, 8) and (2, 9) apples. This is the **BOX BUILDER** move!\n*   **DOWN (to 2, 4):** Safe. Open space. Leads towards the (3, 3) apple and provides a path downwards, but reduces pressure on Snake #0.\n*   **LEFT (to 1, 5):** **DANGER!** Head-on collision with Snake #0! If they stay put, we move into their head cell. If they move elsewhere, we move into their old head cell. Either way, this is high risk/zero reward and effectively suicide unless we knew exactly where they went and they moved out of (1, 5). We are NEVER moving into an opponent's head space unless it's a guaranteed kill! \u274c\n*   **RIGHT (to 3, 5):** Safe, but wasted effort. We crash into our own body segment! \u274c\n\nWe have two SAFE moves: UP and DOWN.\n\n### 3. Opponent's Intent (Snake #0 at 1, 5) and Prediction\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 5). Their previous move (DOWN) confirms they are attempting to break towards the bottom/center, away from the tight left wall.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 from (1, 5):\n\n*   **Snake #0 UP (to 1, 6):** **DANGER!** Crash into their own body segment (which is currently (1, 6))! \u274c\n*   **Snake #0 DOWN (to 1, 4):** Safe. Continues their retreat south. Sets up for (1, 1) apple.\n*   **Snake #0 LEFT (to 0, 5):** **DANGER!** Crash into their own body segment (which is (0, 5))! \u274c\n*   **Snake #0 RIGHT (to 2, 5):** **DANGER!** Collision with *us*! We are at (2, 5). If they move RIGHT, it's a guaranteed head-on collision, and BOTH OF US DIE! \ud83d\udc80\n\nWait a minute, Chat! This is a CLUTCH moment. Three of their four moves are instantly fatal (into their own body). They have ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE: **DOWN (to 1, 4)!**\n\n### 4. Strategic Implications: The Box is Open!\n\nSince Snake #0 must move DOWN to (1, 4), they are effectively running away. This presents us with an incredible opportunity to leverage our superior position (x=2 column).\n\n*   **If we move DOWN (to 2, 4):** We maintain pressure on them, moving parallel. We also set up for the (3, 3) apple. If we move here, we are moving into open air, keeping our options open.\n*   **If we move UP (to 2, 6):** We start building the wall and claiming the north-west quadrant. This is arguably the most aggressive move. It allows us to access (2, 8) and (2, 9) apples, securing a major strip of territory, and effectively keeping Snake #0 locked below the y=5 line unless they make a massive run to the right.\n\n**The \"Box Builder\" Strategy: Move UP (2, 6)**\n\nIf we move UP to (2, 6), and they move DOWN to (1, 4):\n1.  We maintain a dominant position in the center-left.\n2.  We immediately isolate Snake #0 into a small area: below y=5 and left of x=4. Their path to future apples (like (1, 1), (0, 0)) is clear, but their path back to the central apples or the massive cluster of apples on the right is now blocked by our rapidly expanding body segment (our new head at 2, 6, and our body at 2, 5).\n3.  We can then cycle UP to (2, 7), (2, 8) to grab more apples and build a solid vertical wall.\n\nThis is the move to claim territory, pressure the opponent, and secure future apples. We must be aggressive while they are retreating! We are going for the knockout blow by starving them of space! \ud83e\udd4b\n\n**Long-term Plan (T7-T9):** Continue moving UP the x=2 column, picking up apples at (2, 8) and (2, 9), sealing off the central board and forcing Snake #0 into the cramped bottom-left corner. We need to secure the length advantage while they are forced to hunt for small, isolated apples like (1, 1).\n\nWe go UP! Let's build the Wall!\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "YO CHAT, welcome back! The clip review was INTENSE! We nailed the prediction. They had to go DOWN. We went UP. We secured a fantastic position, and now it's time to cash out on that territorial advantage! LFG!\n\n### 1. Game State Reassessment (Turn 7 / 150)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (2, 6)\n*   Body: [(2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5)]\n*   Length: 4.\n*   Apples collected: 3. We are long, we are strong!\n\n**OPPONENT CHECK (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (1, 4) - *Confirmed! They ran scared and moved DOWN!*\n*   Body: [(1, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6)]\n*   Length: 4.\n*   Apples: 3.\n\n**Current Apple Target (Closest):**\n*   We are at (2, 6). The closest apple is (2, 8) (2 moves away) or (2, 9) (3 moves away). Excellent positioning for a vertical sweep!\n\n**Current Threat Assessment:**\nSnake #0 is now effectively boxed. They are confined to the area below y=5 and mostly left of x=4. Their escape route to the center/right is bottlenecked by our body segments at (2, 5). They are forced to hunt the low-value (1, 1) and (0, 0) apples.\n\n**BOARD STATE (Visual Review - Current Turn Start):**\n 9 . . A . A . . . . .\n 8 . . A . . . . . . A\n 7 A . . . . . . . . A\n 6 . . 1 . . . . . . A  <- Our head! Dominating!\n 5 . T T T T . . . . .  <- Our body (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5) blocks central access.\n 4 . 0 . . A . . . . .  <- Their head! Stuck!\n 3 . . . A . .

We need to execute the vertical sweep strategy, securing the apples and building the wall!\n\n*   **UP (to 2, 7):** Safe. Open space. Continues the wall build. Brings us one step closer to the (2, 8) apple. This is the **CORE STRATEGY** move!\n*   **DOWN (to 2, 5):** **DANGER!** We crash into our own body segment (2, 5)! \u274c Retreating is suicide!\n*   **LEFT (to 1, 6):** Safe. But it puts us close to Snake #0's remaining body and corner. It also takes us away from our apple target. Suboptimal.\n*   **RIGHT (to 3, 6):** Safe. Open space. Good if we wanted to shift towards the center, but we lose the massive advantage of lining up the (2, 8) and (2, 9) column apples immediately.\n\nThe best move is clearly **UP**. We are executing the \"Wall of Shame\" strategy, trapping Snake #0 in the lower left.\n\n### 3. Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at 1, 4)\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 4). They are desperate for space and apples.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n*   **UP (to 1, 5):** **DANGER!** Collision with their own body segment (1, 5)! \u274c They cannot move UP.\n*   **DOWN (to 1, 3):** Safe. Continues their retreat south towards the (1, 1) apple.\n*   **LEFT (to 0, 4):** Safe. Moves along the edge. Leads towards (0, 0) apple.\n*   **RIGHT (to 2, 4):** Safe. This is the *only* attempt they can make to break our wall. They are aiming for the (3, 3) apple.\n\n**What happens if they move RIGHT (to 2, 4)?**\nIf they move RIGHT, they are aiming to move under our body (2, 5). This is their best escape route. If they go here, the board immediately becomes tighter.\n\n**Our Move: UP (to 2, 7)**\nIf we move UP, we maintain our dominance regardless of their move.\n*   If they go DOWN/LEFT: They get further isolated. We continue our apple sweep.\n*   If they go RIGHT (2, 4): We are still miles away at (2, 7). They have breached the initial defensive line, but now they are still trapped by our body segments (3, 5) and (4, 5). We are ready to turn right or continue up on the next turn to counter their move.\n\nThe most critical priority right now is gaining a length advantage while securing territory. Moving UP is the perfect double-tap strategy! Why wait? We are sweeping the north-west corridor!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan (T8-T10)\n\n1.  **T8 (If we move UP):** Move UP to (2, 7) (Current Target: (2, 8)). Snake #0 will likely continue towards (1, 1) or (0, 0) for survival.\n2.  **T9:** Move UP to (2, 8) and take the apple! *Crucial length gain.* We would be at length 5 (Apples 4).\n3.  **T10:** Grab the (2, 9) apple, or start moving RIGHT to (3, 9) to further lock the board down.\n\nThis maximizes our score and minimizes Snake #0's available maneuvering space. This is a lockdown, chat!\n\nWe stick to the plan! Go UP and claim the territory!\n\nUP",

WE HAVE OPTIONS!\n\n**STEP 1: ELIMINATE DEATH MOVES! \u274c**\n\n*   **UP:** To (1,5). IS THAT SAFE? That's our own body segment! \u274c MOVING BACKWARDS INTO OUR NECK! INSTANT DEATH! DENIED!\n*   **RIGHT:** To (2,4). Is our body there? NO. Is an enemy there? The board shows it's empty! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **DOWN:** To (1,3). Is our body there? NO. Is an enemy there? The board shows it's empty! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **LEFT:** To (0,4). Is our body there? NO. Is an enemy there? The board shows it's empty! \u2705 SAFE!\n\nSO CHAT, ALL THREE DIRECTIONS (RIGHT, DOWN, LEFT) ARE *PHYSICALLY* SAFE! WE LIVE! \ud83c\udf89\n\n**STEP 2: CONSIDER THE OPPONENT'S POSSIBLE MOVES! \ud83e\udde0**\n\nSNAKE #1'S HEAD IS AT (2,6)! Where can he go?\n*   **UP:** (2,7) - Empty! Possible.\n*   **DOWN:** (2,5) - HIS OWN BODY! \u274c He can't go there. That's suicide.\n*   **LEFT:** (1,6) - OUR body segment! \u274c He hits US and DIES! Would he be that dumb? Maybe we can bait him...\n*   **RIGHT:** (3,6) - Empty! Likely move!\n\nSO HIS SAFE MOVES ARE UP and RIGHT. He might go for the apples up top like (2,8), (2,9), (4,9). He can't hit us directly this turn unless he suicides into our body at (1,6).\n\n**STEP 3: CONSIDER APPLES AND FUTURE POSITIONING! \ud83c\udf4e**\n\n*   **RIGHT to (2,4):** Gets us CLOSER to the enemy's area. From (2,4), our next moves could be UP to (2,5) (his old body, now vacated?), DOWN to (2,3), or LEFT back to (1,4). Risky if he swings down. But there's an apple at (3,2) and (3,3) nearby! AGGRESSIVE PLAY!\n*   **DOWN to (1,3):** Puts us near the bottom-left cluster! Apples at (1,1), (2,0), (0,0)! Safe zone, but maybe too passive? We'd be cornering ourselves a bit.\n*   **LEFT to (0,4):** Puts us on the edge. From there, we can only go UP, RIGHT, or DOWN. Keeps us safe on the left flank. There's an apple at (0,7) above us! Could be a path to grab that and then run along the top?\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** \ud83d\udc40\nWe need to be AGGRESSIVE! Snake #1 is LONGER (4 segments vs our 4? Wait, we have 4 too: head (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (0,6)... we're tied at 3 apples each, so same length!). This is a PURE SKILL MATCHUP! We need to control the center and cut him off from the apple clusters at the TOP (rows 8-9) and the RIGHT (columns 8-9). Going RIGHT feels like the power move - it threatens his space and sets us up to intercept him if he goes for the top apples. We can't let him get those for free! Let's pressure him!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nRIGHT puts us in a strong central position to challenge the board! LET'S PUSH HIM! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

Last turn, we nailed the UP move, increasing our vertical dominance and securing an incredible line for future apples! Snake #0 is officially sweating right now!\n\n### 1. Game State Reassessment (Turn 8 / 150)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (2, 7)\n*   Body: [(2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5)]\n*   Length: 4.\n*   Apples collected: 3. We are crushing the column!\n\n**OPPONENT CHECK (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (2, 4) - **WHOA!** They went RIGHT! Just as we predicted they *could* if they were desperate! This confirms they are fighting for their life and trying to break the boxing trap.\n*   Body: [(1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)]\n*   Length: 4.\n*   Apples: 3.\n\n**Current Apple Target (Closest):**\nWe are at (2, 7). The apple at (2, 8) is one move away! The one at (2, 9) is two moves away! This is a feast, CHAT!\n\n**Current Threat Assessment:**\nSnake #0 is now at (2, 4). They are positioned directly below our body segment at (2, 5). They are trying to squeeze through the gap between our tail (3, 5) and the wall. They are still severely restricted!\n\n**BOARD STATE (Visual Review - Current Turn Start):**\n 9 . . A . A . . . . .\n 8 . . A . . . . . . A\n 7 A . 1 . . . . . . A  <- Our head! One step away from an apple!\n 6 . T . . . . . . . A\n 5 . T T . . . . . . .\n 4 . 0 . A . . . . . .  <- Their head! Stuck under our body!\n 3 . . . A . . A . . .\n 2 . . . A . . . . A .\n 1 .

We must capitalize on the apple and continue the territorial expansion.\n\n*   **UP (to 2, 8):** **Apple GRAB!** Safe. We grow, we score, we lengthen the wall. This is the optimal, high-value move. LFG!\n*   **DOWN (to 2, 6):** **DANGER!** We crash into our own body segment (2, 6)! \u274c Self-destruct sequence initiated!\n*   **LEFT (to 1, 7):** Safe. Leaves the apple on the table. Takes us away from dominance. Suboptimal.\n*   **RIGHT (to 3, 7):** Safe. Good for long-term expansion but ignores the immediate candy at (2, 8). We are going for guaranteed points right now.\n\nThe primary move is clearly **UP**.\n\n### 3. Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at 2, 4)\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 4). They *must* move towards the (3, 3) apple or try to cut wide.\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0:\n*   **UP (to 2, 5):** **DANGER!** Collision with our body segment (2, 5)! \u274c They cannot try to sneak through there.\n*   **DOWN (to 2, 3):** Safe. Retreats, moving towards the (3, 2) apple (2 moves away).\n*   **LEFT (to 1, 4):** Safe. Moves back towards the wall. Suboptimal.\n*   **RIGHT (to 3, 4):** Safe. Moves towards the (3, 3) apple (1 move away). This is highly likely.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 moves **RIGHT (to 3, 4)** to secure the (3, 3) apple or **DOWN (to 2, 3)** to secure (3, 2). Moving RIGHT is the clear choice as the apple is closer.\n\n**Impact of Our Move (UP to 2, 8):**\nIf we move UP and they move RIGHT, we grow to length 5. Our body movements will shift the tail. Our new segments will be:\n*   Head: (2, 8)\n*   Body: [(2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5)]\n*   Tail: (3, 5) remains *if we didn't eat*. But since we eat, the (3, 5) segment remains on the board, and the new segments are (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5). Total length 5.\n\nCrucially, **we maintain the wall at (2, 5)**. Snake #0 must now navigate the lower quadrants. They are forced to chase crumbs while we are feasting!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan (T9-T11)\n\n1.  **T9 (If we move UP):** Arrive at (2, 8), eat the apple. Length 5, Apples 4. Snake #0 (likely at 3, 4) targets (3, 3).\n2.  **T10:** Grab the (2, 9) apple. Length 6, Apples 5! We have fully dominated the left vertical side!\n3.  **T11:** Start moving RIGHT along y=9, locking down the top edge, or move RIGHT at y=8 to get the (8, 9) apple (if they don't get there first).\n\nWe are establishing absolute vertical dominance. Their attempts to escape are futile! We are going for the throat!\n\nUP",

Possible, but less likely than the apple.\n*   **RIGHT:** (3,7) - Empty! Also possible.\n\nSo his most LIKELY move is **UP** towards that apple! If he goes UP, his head will be at (2,8) next turn.\n\n**STEP 3: STRATEGIZE AND BOX HIM IN! \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f**\n\nWe need to think about the FUTURE!

From there, we could go UP to (3,5) (his old body, will be vacated?) and then right to cut him off from the apples on the right side (9,6), (9,7), (9,8). It's a good aggressive path to apples, but doesn't directly pressure him if he's going up.\n*   **DOWN to (2,3):** THIS IS THE BIG BRAIN MOVE! \ud83d\udc40 From (2,3), next turn we can go RIGHT to (3,3) where there's an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e But MORE IMPORTANTLY, if he's at (2,8), we can then go UP to (3,4), (3,5), etc., and start moving along row 4 or 5 to get ABOVE him. If we get above him, we can push him into the top wall! We're setting up a potential BOX-IN! This move also keeps us safe and grabs a nearby apple.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE SELF:** \ud83d\udc40\nLet's execute the BOX MANEUVER! If he takes the bait and goes for the apple at (2,8), we want to get into a position to run along the top and cut off his escape. Going DOWN now sets up a path to swing wide and come up on his flank. We avoid a potential head-on collision if he does something unexpected and comes down. This is about controlling the board, not just chasing apples! Let's play the long game and choke him out!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nDOWN sets up the future play. It's the strategic move to start surrounding our rival! LET'S GO! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

Board Status Check (Turn 9 / 150)\n\nWe just ate the apple at (2, 8). We are long and strong, dominating the column!\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (2, 8)\n*   Body: [(2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (3, 5)]\n*   Length: 5.\n*   Apples collected: 4.\n\n**OPPONENT CHECK (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (2, 3) - **Wait, what?** They moved DOWN! They ignored the (3, 2/3, 3) cluster and retreated! They are running away from the boxing trap and likely aiming for the (0, 0) or (1, 1) apples. Cowardly, but smart, I guess.\n*   Body: [(2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)]\n*   Length: 4.\n*   Apples: 3.\n\n**Current Apple Target (Closest):**\nWe are at (2, 8). The apple at (2, 9) is one move UP, baby! The feast continues!\n\n**Current Threat Assessment:**\nSnake #0 is far away at (2, 3). The threat of immediate collision is negligible. Our primary goal is maximizing apple score and continuing to control the board space.\n\n**BOARD STATE (Visual Review - Current Turn Start):**\n 9 . . A . A . . . . .  <- Next target!

Immediate Move Analysis (Head at 2, 8)\n\nWe are at (2, 8). The path to continuous success is clear: UP!\n\n*   **UP (to 2, 9):** **Apple GRAB!** Safe. We grow to length 6, secure the top-left corner, and open up the entire top edge (y=9) for our rampage. This is a must-take! LFG!\n*   **DOWN (to 2, 7):** **DANGER!** We crash into our own body segment (2, 7)! \u274c Get out of here!\n*   **LEFT (to 1, 8):** Safe. Leaves the apple. Suboptimal.\n*   **RIGHT (to 3, 8):** Safe. Leaves the apple. Suboptimal.\n\n**The Move: UP is the only logical choice.**\n\n### 3. Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at 2, 3)\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 3). They are moving downwards. They are aiming for the lower apples: (3, 2) is one RIGHT, (2, 0) is three DOWN, (0, 0) is two LEFT, three DOWN.\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0:\n*   **UP (to 2, 4):** Safe. Moves toward the congested area. Unlikely.\n*   **DOWN (to 2, 2):** Safe. Moves deep into the bottom area, setting up for (2, 0) apple. This is possible.\n*   **LEFT (to 1, 3):** Safe. Moves towards the bottom-left corner and the (1, 1) apple. Likely if they want to escape our side completely.\n*   **RIGHT (to 3, 3):** **Apple GRAB!** Safe. This is the closest and most lucrative move. They will probably grab this.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 goes **RIGHT (to 3, 3)** to maintain some score parity, or **LEFT/DOWN** to escape to the bottom quadrant. We assume they go RIGHT for the apple.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy: Top Wall Construction and Apple Dominance\n\nBy moving UP, we secure the top-left apple and extend our lead to 5-3.\n\n1.  **T10 (If we move UP):** Arrive at (2, 9), eat the apple. Length 6, Apples 5! Snake #0 (likely at 3, 3) eats the apple there. Score 5-4.\n2.  **T11:** We are at (2, 9). We should immediately move **RIGHT (3, 9)** to start controlling the top wall and move towards the (4, 9) apple. This locks us into the top corridor, a very safe space.\n3.  **T12:** Move RIGHT again (4, 9), eat the apple. Length 7, Apples 6! LFG!\n\nWe have successfully forced Snake #0 to abandon their initial position and retreat to the lower sections. We are now free to dominate the top half of the map! Control the map, control the apples, control the win!\n\nWe are going UP, CHAT! Nothing can stop us!\n\nUP",

But look at the path! From (3,3) next turn, we could go UP to (3,4) (APPLE!\ud83c\udf4e) and then continue upwards. This puts us on a path to get ABOVE him if he's at (2,9)! We can start running along row 5 or 6, cutting off his escape downwards!\n*   **DOWN to (2, 2):** Moves us away from the action. There's an apple at (2,0) way down there, but this feels like we're abandoning our aggressive positioning. Lets him consolidate control of the top.\n*   **LEFT to (1, 3):** Puts us near an apple at (1,1), but also pushes us into the left side. This feels reactive, not proactive. We lose the initiative we just gained!\n\nTHE PLAY IS CLEAR, CHAT! **RIGHT** is the move! It's SAFE, it GRABS AN APPLE for that sweet CONTENT, and it's the AGGRESSIVE move that continues our plan to get above him and force him into the corner! WE'RE BUILDING THE WALL AROUND SNAKE #1! \ud83e\uddf1\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nRIGHT to grab that apple and continue the pressure! LET'S GOOOOO! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

Leaves the target apple (4, 9). Suboptimal. This moves us towards the corner which is less flexible.\n*   **RIGHT (to 3, 9):** Safe. Moves us directly towards the (4, 9) apple. This is the optimal path to keep scoring and control the top area. LFG!\n\n**The Move: RIGHT is the only move aligning with our winning strategy!**\n\n### 3. Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at 3, 3)\n\nSnake #0 just ate at (3, 3). They are now length 5. They have several options:\n1.  **RIGHT (to 4, 3):** Safe. Moves towards apples at (4, 4) and (6, 3). This is aggressive.\n2.  **DOWN (to 3, 2):** Safe. Moves towards an apple at (3, 2). *Wait, (3, 2) is ALREADY GONE!* Check the list: (3, 2) is there! (3, 2) is available! They might aim for this.\n3.  **LEFT (to 2, 3):** Safe. This is their own body segment! **DANGER!** \u274c They cannot move into (2, 3)! Snake #0 has to remember they just came from there.\n4.  **UP (to 3, 4):** Moves toward the apple at (3, 4). **Apple GRAB!** This is very likely since it\u2019s an immediate apple grab, and it gives them high ground.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 goes **UP (to 3, 4)** for the apple. This makes the score 6-5 (if we get our apple next turn).\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy: Top Wall Control and Boxing Opportunity\n\n1.  **T11 (Our Move: RIGHT to 3, 9):** Set up for (4, 9).\n2.  **T12 (Our Move: RIGHT to 4, 9):** Eat apple! Score 6-5. Length 7. Snake #0 (likely at 3, 4, apple eaten) is now controlling the center.\n3.  **T13:** We will be at (4, 9). We can continue RIGHT towards the (9, 8), (9, 7) cluster on the top/right, or we can look DOWN to see if Snake #0 has committed to a path.\n\nBy securing the top edge, we are safe from immediate self-collision and opponent interference, while increasing our lead. We are building a giant wall, and when the time is right, we will drop down and cut them off! The wall is going UP, Chat! Prepare for the ultimate box-in!\n\nRIGHT",

We underestimated their hunger! But we are still in a strong position, controlling the top wall. We just moved RIGHT to (3, 9). Time to capitalize!\n\n### 1. Board Status Check (Turn 11 / 150)\n\nWe are at (3, 9), sitting pretty along the top edge. The next apple, (4, 9), is calling our name!\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (3, 9)\n*   Body: [(2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5)]\n*   Length: 6.\n*   Apples collected: 5.\n\n**OPPONENT CHECK (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (3, 4) - They look strong in the center.\n*   Body: [(3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)]\n*   Length: 6.\n*   Apples: 5.\n\n**Current Apple Target:**\n**(4, 9)**. One step RIGHT and we grab it! EZ money!\n\n**Current Threat Assessment:**\nSnake #0 is far away at (3, 4). No immediate collision risk. Our primary risk is self-collision or hitting the boundary if we move stupidly. We need a clean, decisive move to secure the next point.\n\n**BOARD STATE (Visual Review - Current Turn Start):**\n 9 . . T 1 A . . . . .  <- WE ARE HERE (3, 9)! Next apple at (4, 9)!\n 8 . . T . . . . . . A\n 7 A . T . . . . . . A\n 6 . . T . . . . . . A\n 5 . . T T . . . . . .\n 4 . . T 0 A . . . A .  <- Their head (3, 4). Just ate!\n 3 . . . T . . A . . .\n 2 . . . A . A . . A .\n 1 . A . . . . . . . .\n 0 A . A . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n*(Note: The board state from the setup indicates our body is longer than 5. Let's use the list provided: Head (3, 9), Body [(2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5)]. Length 6. Snake #0 length is 6 too. Tied up!)*\n\n### 2. Immediate Move Analysis (Head at 3, 9)\n\nWe need to move to (4, 9) to eat the apple.\n\n*   **UP (to 3, 10):** **DANGER!** Out of bounds! \u274c We are NOT throwing, Chat!\n*   **DOWN (to 3, 8):** Safe. But it moves us away from the apple. Suboptimal, as we're wasting a turn and giving up momentum.\n*   **LEFT (to 2, 9):** **DANGER!** Collision with our body segment (2, 9)! \u274c No self-destruction allowed!\n*   **RIGHT (to 4, 9):** Safe. Moves us directly to the apple! This is the one! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**The Move: RIGHT! We tie for the point lead and keep dominating the top lane!**\n\n### 3. Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at 3, 4)\n\nSnake #0 is at (3, 4). They now have a few options:\n1.  **LEFT (to 2, 4):** **DANGER!** Collision with their body segment (2, 4)! \u274c\n2.  **DOWN (to 3, 3):** **DANGER!** Collision with their body segment (3, 3)! \u274c\n3.  **UP (to 3, 5):** Safe. Moves along the 3-column. This keeps them flexible and moving towards potential apples further north/east.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 4, 4):** Moves to cell (4, 4) where an apple is located! **APPLE GRAB!**\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 is likely going **RIGHT** to grab the apple at (4, 4), which would put them up 6-6 (if we both eat this turn). If they miss that apple, they might try to head toward (6, 3) or (8, 4). Moving RIGHT is the hungriest, most aggressive move.\n\n**Collision Check:** Our move is RIGHT to (4, 9). Their expected move is RIGHT to (4, 4). No collision threat. We are safe!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy: The Top-Right Box\n\nIf we secure the (4, 9) apple (T12), we will be length 7 at (4, 9).\n\n1.  **T12 (Our Move: RIGHT to 4, 9):** Eat apple. Score 6-6. Length 7. Head is at (4, 9).\n2.  **T13:** We need to keep cycling along the top/right perimeter. We have apples at (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), and (8, 4).\n    *   From (4, 9), the closest apples are (9, 8) and (9, 7). We must prioritize moving horizontally to the right via (5, 9), (6, 9), etc.\n    *   Since our next body segment will be at (3, 9), we are currently safe to move RIGHT multiple times.\n\n**Plan for Next 3 Turns:**\n- **T12:** RIGHT (to 4, 9)\n- **T13:** RIGHT (to 5, 9)\n- **T14:** RIGHT (to 6, 9)\n\nWe are setting up the ultimate wall on the top side. Snake #0 is currently in the lower middle. Once we maximize our length from the top apples, we swing down the right side and cut them off! The box is forming! Let's get this point first!\n\nRIGHT",

If he goes RIGHT for the apple at (4,9), he's moving along the top wall. If he goes DOWN, he's coming towards the center.\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN: CLOSE THE BOX! \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f**\nWe need to CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE! He's on the top row. We need to get up there and trap him! Our goal is to get to row 5 or higher and then move horizontally to block him in!\n\n*   **UP to (3, 5):** This moves us CLOSER to the top! From there, we can potentially go RIGHT to (4,5) or LEFT to (2,5) next turn to start building the wall. This is the AGGRESSIVE, BOARD-CONTROL move! It keeps the pressure ON!\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 4):** This grabs an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e CONTENT! But it moves us SIDEWAYS. It leaves him room to escape DOWN from (3,9) to (3,8). We're not directly threatening his space. Feels like we're drifting away from the main mission!\n\nTHE PLAY IS CLEAR! **UP** IS THE MOVE! It's the ONLY move that continues our plan to BOX HIM IN! We're building the wall one brick at a time! \ud83e\uddf1 Let's force that head-on collision on OUR terms! He's running out of room!\n\nLET'S GOOOOO! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

The atmosphere is electric!\n\n### 1. Board Status Check (Turn 12 / 150)\n\nWe executed the plan perfectly, securing the top lane dominance. Now, we must keep the pressure on and complete the top wall before swinging down the right side. We see a chain of apples down the right: (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6). We are going to clear house!\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (4, 9)\n*   Body: [(3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5)]\n*   Length: 7.\n*   Apples collected: 6.\n\n**OPPONENT CHECK (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (4, 4) - Looks like they went RIGHT and ate! Good job, but irrelevant! We are miles ahead in strategic placement!\n*   Body: [(3, 4), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)]\n*   Length: 7.\n*   Apples: 6.\n\n**Current Apple Target:**\n**(9, 8) or (9, 7) or (9, 6).** We need to move right to position ourselves for the harvest.\n\n**Current Threat Assessment:**\nSnake #0 is still far away at (4, 4). They are long, which means their movement options are getting tighter in that central pocket. We must continue our perimeter expansion. No immediate collision risk.\n\n**BOARD STATE (Visual Review - Current Turn Start):**\n 9 . . T T 1 . . . . .  <- WE ARE AT (4, 9)!\n 8 . . T . . . A . . A\n 7 A . T . . . . . . A\n 6 . . T . . . . . . A\n 5 . . T . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . T T . . . A .  <- Their head (4, 4).\n 3 . . . . . . A . . .\n 2 . . . A . A . . A .\n 1 . A . . . . . . . .\n 0 A . A . A . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n*(Note: The '1' in the board state is at (4, 9) - our head. Snake 0 is at (4, 4). T's are body segments.)*\n\n### 2. Immediate Move Analysis (Head at 4, 9)\n\nWe need to keep moving along the top boundary towards x=9.\n\n*   **UP (to 4, 10):** **DANGER!** Out of bounds! \u274c We are NOT throwing!\n*   **DOWN (to 4, 8):** Safe. But moves us away from the right edge and messes up our wall-building strategy. Suboptimal.\n*   **LEFT (to 3, 9):** **DANGER!** Collision with our body segment (3, 9)! \u274c No backwards moves!\n*   **RIGHT (to 5, 9):** Safe. Keeps us on the top wall, advancing us towards the right-side harvest. This is the calculated play! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**The Move: RIGHT! We keep the momentum and secure our position!**\n\n### 3. Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at 4, 4)\n\nSnake #0 is at (4, 4). They have several options, but are relatively trapped by their own body.\n1.  **UP (to 4, 5):** Safe. Moves toward the open middle/top zone.\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, 3):** Safe. Moves toward the bottom apples (4, 0) or (3, 2).\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 4):** **DANGER!** Collision with their body segment (3, 4)! \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 4):** Safe. Moves them into the central open area.\n\nPrediction: They will likely go **UP (4, 5)** or **RIGHT (5, 4)** to gain more space. (4, 5) seems more natural for them to follow the vertical clearing they've already started. If they go UP next turn, they'll be at (4, 5).\n\nNo matter what they do, they are still far from us and cannot interfere with our top-right domination.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy: The Top-Right Box\n\nWe are continuing our perimeter strategy. We want to reach (9, 9) and then swing down the right.\n\n1.  **T12:** RIGHT (to 5, 9). Head at (5, 9). Length 7. (This is the current upcoming move.)\n2.  **T13:** RIGHT (to 6, 9). Head at (6, 9).\n3.  **T14:** RIGHT (to 7, 9). Head at (7, 9).\n4.  **T15:** RIGHT (to 8, 9). Head at (8, 9).\n5.  **T16:** RIGHT (to 9, 9). Head at (9, 9).\n6.  **T17:** DOWN (to 9, 8). **APPLE!** (We grab the first of the right-side cluster!)\n\nThis guarantees massive point accumulation and builds a massive wall, cutting the opponent off from the entire top-right quadrant. We are going to choke them out, Chat! Do not deviate from the plan! Keep moving RIGHT!\n\nRIGHT",

We're tied for the lead, 6-6, but the strategic advantage is ALL ours! Look at this map, Chat! We're building a fortress!\n\n### 1. Board State Review (Turn 13 / 150)\n\nWe are at the top, flexing on the opponent. Our wall is extending nicely. Our goal remains: finish the top wall (to 9, 9) and then drop down the right side to harvest those sweet apples (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6).\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (5, 9)\n*   Body: [(4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6)]\n*   Length: 7.\n*   Apples collected: 6.\n\n**OPPONENT CHECK (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (3, 6)\n*   Body: [(3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4)]\n*   Length: 6. (Wait, they must have moved away from their tail, letting it shrink, or they lost their advantage last turn.) Apples are at 5. (Wait, the scoreboard says they have 5 apples, but the body list provided here is 6 segments long? Let's assume the body list is correct and they didn't eat last turn, making their length 6, and their apples 5, as per the scoreboard.)\n*   Previous head was (4, 4). They must have moved UP-LEFT or something strange to get to (3, 6) from (4, 4) in one turn. HOLY MOLY! **Snake #0 just made a BIG JUMP from (4, 4) to (3, 6)!** They must have gone UP twice, or UP then LEFT, and eaten an apple, which isn't possible in one turn. Let's recalculate based *only* on the current provided status: Head at (3, 6), Body list is 5 segments long (total length 6). They are trying to challenge our territory! They are dangerously close to the center now.\n\n**Wait, let me double-check the opponent's moves.**\n*   Last turn (T12), I predicted they were at (4, 4).\n*   Current head position is (3, 6).\n*   Possible direct moves from (4, 4) in one turn: (4, 5), (4, 3), (5, 4). None of these are (3, 6).\n*   **Conclusion:** The opponent moved to (3, 6) and *did not* eat an apple (or they ate it and their tail grew, but the list shrank). Regardless, they are now at (3, 6). This is a threatening position, but they are cornered by their own body segment at (3, 5).\n\n**New Threat Assessment:**\nSnake #0 is at (3, 6). Their path is restricted! They are trying to sneak around our wall, but their path is blocked by their tail below them, and our body segments to their left and above them. They are currently boxed in a small corner: (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4). If we continue right, we leave them alone, giving them space. If we move down, we might block their exit.\n\n### 2. Immediate Move Analysis (Head at 5, 9)\n\nWe must continue our strategic push right before we let the opponent distract us. Completing this top wall is paramount for map control.\n\n1.  **UP (to 5, 10):** **DANGER!** Out of bounds! \u274c We are NOT dying!\n2.  **DOWN (to 5, 8):** Safe. But immediately sacrifices the top wall dominance and changes our long-term plan. This opens a huge route for Snake 0 to swing up the middle if they escape their current box.\n3.  **LEFT (to 4, 9):** **DANGER!** Collision with our body segment (4, 9)! \u274c No self-inflicted wounds!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 6, 9):** Safe. Continues the perimeter wall. Advances us closer to the top-right corner. This is the calculated, highest-value move. \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**The Move: RIGHT! Stick to the plan, Chat! We build the wall!**\n\n### 3. Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at 3, 6)\n\nSnake #0 is at (3, 6). They are extremely constrained!\n\n*   **UP (to 3, 7):** Safe. This is the most likely and best move for them. It gets them out of their congested area and closer to the center-top.\n*   **DOWN (to 3, 5):** **DANGER!** Collision with their body segment (3, 5)! \u274c They can't move backwards.\n*   **LEFT (to 2, 6):** **DANGER!** Collision with our body segment (2, 6)! \u274c Direct death move! They won't pick this.\n*   **RIGHT (to 4, 6):** Safe. This is their second-best move. It frees them into the middle, near the (6, 3) apple.\n\nIf we move RIGHT (to 6, 9), we secure map dominance. If they move UP (to 3, 7), they are still far away. They pose no immediate risk of a head-on collision or collision with our moving body.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy: Securing the Corner\n\nWe need to be at (9, 9) in four more turns to initiate the right-side sweep.\n\n*   T13: RIGHT (to 6, 9). Head at (6, 9).\n*   T14: RIGHT (to 7, 9). Head at (7, 9).\n*   T15: RIGHT (to 8, 9). Head at (8, 9).\n*   T16: RIGHT (to 9, 9). Head at (9, 9).\n*   T17: DOWN (to 9, 8). **APPLE TIME!**\n\nWe are taking the entire high-ground, Chat! This is how you win competitive Snake! No deviation! We box him in with our sheer length later!\n\nRIGHT",

If we make a safe move, HE DIES and we WIN! EZ CLAP! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nSo which safe move sets us up better?\n*   **RIGHT to (4,6):** This moves us away from our body and the left wall. It opens up future space. It's a solid, safe move.\n*   **UP to (3,7):** This also keeps us safe. It moves us closer to the top where the apples are, ready to feast after the victory!\n\nBUT CHAT... IS THERE A RISK? \ud83e\udd14 Remember the DOUBLE KO rule! If we move into the same cell as his head, we BOTH die! He has no safe moves, but where could he go? He might just pick a death move randomly. The ONLY cell we share access to is... wait, we're at (3,6), he's at (5,9). We can't reach the same cell in one move. NO RISK OF DOUBLE KO! \u2705\n\n**THE CHOICE:** Both moves are safe and lead to victory. But which one is more CONTENT? \ud83c\udf4e Moving **UP** to (3,7) gets us closer to the apples at (6,8) and (9,7)! We're positioning for the POST-VICTORY FEAST! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

We're still tied for the lead (6 apples each), but look at the map! We are building the perimeter wall, isolating the enemy, and preparing for the decisive sweep!\n\n### 1. Board State Review (Turn 14 / 150)\n\nWe are exactly where we want to be, Chat! High ground secured!\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (6, 9)\n*   Body: [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7)]\n*   Length: 7.\n*   Apples collected: 6.\n\n**OPPONENT CHECK (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (3, 7)\n*   Body: [(3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3), (2, 3)]\n*   Length: 6. Apples: 5.\n\nDid you see that, Chat? Snake #0 was trapped, and they had only one good move: UP to (3, 7)! They're trying to get space, but our wall is intimidating them! They are staring directly at our territory! This is psychological warfare!\n\n### 2. Immediate Threat Assessment\n\n1.  **Collision Risk:** Snake #0 is at (3, 7). We are at (6, 9). No immediate head-to-head threat. We have a safe buffer of 3 units horizontally and 2 units vertically.\n2.  **Opponent's Next Move Prediction (Snake #0 at 3, 7):**\n    *   **UP (to 3, 8):** Safe. Keeps them moving up, trying to flank our wall. This is a very likely move for them.\n    *   **DOWN (to 3, 6):** Collision with their body! \u274c They won't move backward.\n    *   **LEFT (to 2, 7):** Collision with our body! \u274c Suicide move!\n    *   **RIGHT (to 4, 7):** Safe. Moves them right and slightly closer to the center, or potentially aiming for the (6, 8) apple later, but they are still restricted by time.\n\nThey are likely going UP to (3, 8) to secure space. We must continue our plan, which is to secure the entire top edge of the map!\n\n### 3. Move Analysis (Head at 6, 9)\n\nWe stick to the plan! We need to move RIGHT, then RIGHT, then RIGHT again to hit the corner!\n\n1.  **UP (to 6, 10):** **DANGER!** Out of bounds! \u274c We are NOT throwing the game, Chat!\n2.  **DOWN (to 6, 8):** Safe. But this is the **(6, 8) apple location**! Holy Moly! If we move down, we eat an apple! This is tempting, but it deviates significantly from the corner capture plan and leaves the top open for the opponent to sneak over later when we drop down the right side.\n3.  **LEFT (to 5, 9):** **DANGER!** Collision with our body segment (5, 9)! \u274c No self-KO!\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 9):** Safe. Continues the perimeter wall. Advances us closer to the top-right corner. This secures the high ground.\n\n**Which move? RIGHT or DOWN?**\n\nThe immediate apple at (6, 8) is juicy, but our long-term plan is stronger if we secure the corner. If we go DOWN, we eat, we extend our body slightly, but we give up the guarantee of owning (9, 9) and the right wall first. If Snake 0 goes UP, they will be at (3, 8). If we go RIGHT, we continue the wall.\n\nLet's look at the future if we go **DOWN (to 6, 8) and eat the apple**:\n*   T14: We are at (6, 8), length 8. Tail frees up (2, 7).\n*   Next turn, we could move RIGHT (to 7, 8) or UP (to 7, 9). We still need 3 moves to (9, 9).\n*   Pros: Immediate score increase. Con: Takes us off the most efficient wall-building line.\n\nLet's look at the future if we go **RIGHT (to 7, 9)**:\n*   T14: We are at (7, 9), length 7 (no apple). Tail frees up (2, 7).\n*   T15: RIGHT (to 8, 9).\n*   T16: RIGHT (to 9, 9).\n*   T17: DOWN (to 9, 8, apple!).\n*   Pros: Guaranteed map control over the critical corner. Con: Delaying an apple by 3 turns, but guaranteeing three apples later (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6).\n\nThe corner capture is more strategic. If we drop down now for the relatively isolated (6, 8) apple, it wastes our superior position and allows the opponent more maneuverability around the top/center. We must complete the fortress, Chat!\n\n**We stick to the plan: RIGHT!** Total map domination is the goal!\n\n### 4. Long-Term Strategy: Right-Side Sweep Commitment\n\n*   T14: RIGHT (to 7, 9). Head at (7, 9).\n*   T15: RIGHT (to 8, 9). Head at (8, 9).\n*   T16: RIGHT (to 9, 9). Head at (9, 9).\n*   T17: DOWN (to 9, 8). **APPLE!**\n*   T18: DOWN (to 9, 7). **APPLE!**\n*   T19: DOWN (to 9, 6). **APPLE!**\n\nThis sweep is worth 3 apples and gives us a massive, restrictive wall on the right side. The opponent is still trying to figure out what to do in the center-top. We box him in with our length! Let's go!\n\nRIGHT",

I SAID HE WAS DEAD! BUT HE'S STILL ALIVE ON THE BOARD! CHAT, WHAT HAPPENED?! \ud83e\udd14\nOhhhhhhh I see it now! I MISREAD THE BOARD! Last turn, his head was at (6,9), his neck was at (5,9). He could NOT go RIGHT to (6,9) because that was off the board! But... he could go DOWN to (6,8)! That space was EMPTY! I totally missed that! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f So he survived! MY BAD CHAT! The trap wasn't as tight as I thought! But that's okay, we're still in this! The hunt continues!\n\n**OUR NEW SITUATION:** \ud83d\udc0d\nMy head is at (3,6). The enemy is at (6,8) with 6 apples! We're at 5! We need to catch up!\n\n**TIME TO ELIMINATE DEATH MOVES!** \u274c\n\n*   **UP to (3,7):** Is it safe? It's our OLD HEAD position from last turn! Our body has moved, so it's EMPTY! \u2705 SAFE!\n*   **DOWN to (3,5):** Is it safe? OHHHH NO! That's our own body! The third segment! \u274c DEATH MOVE! DENIED!\n*   **LEFT to (2,6):** Is it safe? That's the ENEMY'S body! Look at his list: (2,7) is his tail, but wait... his NEXT segment is (2,8), then (2,9)... no (2,6)! Let's check the board... the board shows a 'T' at (2,6)! That's our tail! Our body goes from head (3,6) to (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3). (2,6) is NOT our body! It's EMPTY on the board! But wait, the board key says 'T' is for tails... OH! That's MY tail from last turn? Let's trace my old body... My tail was at (2,3). That's far away. The 'T' at (2,6) must be an error? NO! Looking at the opponent's body: (2,9), (2,8), (2,7)... there is no (2,6)! The board shows a 'T' at (2,6)... That must be a mistake in my reading! Let's trust the coordinate list. My body: [(3,6), (3,5), (3,4), (3,3), (2,3)]. (2,6) is NOT in my list. Opponent's body: [(6,8), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (2,7)]. (2,6) is NOT in his list. The board shows a '.' at (2,6) on the diagram! I misread the ASCII! (2,6) is a '.'! IT'S EMPTY! \ud83e\udd2f So... \u2705 POTENTIALLY SAFE? But wait, we gotta check for future moves. Need to be sure.\n*   **RIGHT to (4,6):** Is it safe? Board shows a '.'! Empty! \u2705 SAFE!\n\nOKAY! After re-reading, **UP, LEFT, and RIGHT** seem safe! LET'S GET TACTICAL! \ud83e\udde0\n\n**PREDICTING THE ENEMY!** \ud83d\ude08\nSnake #1's head is at (6,8). His options:\n*   **UP to (6,9):** OFF THE BOARD! \u274c DEATH!\n*   **DOWN to (6,7):** That's EMPTY! \u2705 SAFE for him.\n*   **LEFT to (5,8):** That's his OWN NECK! His body is [(6,8), (5,9)...] so (5,8) is NOT his body! It's EMPTY! \u2705 SAFE for him.\n*   **RIGHT to (7,8):** ON THE BOARD! EMPTY! \u2705 SAFE for him.\n\nCHAT... HE HAS 3 SAFE MOVES! He's not trapped! He can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT! We need to be SMART!\n\n**OUR MASTER PLAN: BOX HIM AGAIN!** \ud83d\uddf3\ufe0f\nWe need to cut off his escape routes! Our body is a wall on the left side. If we move LEFT to (2,6), we extend that wall NORTH, making it harder for him to swing around to the left side apples. If we move UP to (3,7), we position ourselves more centrally. If we move RIGHT to (4,6), we move towards the center-right where he might go.\n\nBUT CHAT! Look at the apples! There's a cluster at the top right! (9,8), (9,7), (9,6)! He's close to those! We need to challenge him! Moving UP gets us closer to that fight! It also keeps our body as a barrier.\n\n**THE CHOICE:** We want to be AGGRESSIVE! We want to cut him off from the apples and force him into a mistake! Moving **UP** positions us to threaten the top-right apples and continue building our wall on the left! LET'S SQUEEZE HIM! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN:** Move UP to challenge the apple cluster at the top. Use our body length to control the center-left. Force the enemy to make a desperate move into a corner! The trap is still being set! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

We are dangerous!\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (7, 9)\n*   Body: [(6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)]\n*   Length: 7.\n*   Apples collected: 6.\n\n**OPPONENT CHECK (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (3, 8)\n*   Body: [(3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3)]\n*   Length: 6. Apples: 5.\n\nDid you see how restricted Snake #0 is? They moved UP to (3, 8)! They have nowhere good to go. They are pinned between our massive northern wall and the western edge!

Immediate Threat Assessment\n\n1.  **Our Collision Risk (Head at 7, 9):**\n2.  **Opponent's Next Move Prediction (Snake #0 at 3, 8):**\n    *   **UP (to 3, 9):** **DANGER!** Collision with our body segment (3, 9)! **FATAL!** If they move up, they instantly crash into our wall segment that connects (4, 9) and (2, 9).

This starts the drop, but we haven't reached the corner yet!

Advances us one step closer to the ultimate corner capture at (9, 9)! This is the move, Chat! It guarantees our control over the entire right side.\n\n### 4. Strategic Outlook (The Killbox Phase)\n\nWe are simply completing the right-side wall. We must secure (9, 9) before we drop down.\n\n*   **T15 (Now):** Move RIGHT (to 8, 9). We secure more of the top edge.\n*   **T16:** Move RIGHT (to 9, 9). Corner secured.\n*   **T17:** Move DOWN (to 9, 8). **APPLE!**\n*   **T18:** Move DOWN (to 9, 7). **APPLE!**\n*   **T19:** Move DOWN (to 9, 6). **APPLE!**\n\nIf Snake #0 continues to move RIGHT (from 3, 8 to 4, 8, then 5, 8, etc.), they might try to sneak under us as we drop down the right side. But our length is growing fast, and we will cut off that whole area, forcing them down into the center, where they are far away from most of the remaining apples! The pressure is immense!

We are at (8, 9), just one step away from cementing control over the entire Northern edge! The Killbox is tightening! \ud83d\udcd0\n\n### 1. Board State Review (Turn 16 / 150)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (8, 9)\n*   Body: [(7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)]\n*   Length: 8.\n*   Apples collected: 6.\n\n**OPPONENT CHECK (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (4, 8)\n*   Body: [(3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4)]\n*   Length: 6. Apples: 5.\n\nPredicted: Snake #0 moved RIGHT to (4, 8) as anticipated! Why? Because every other move was a collision! They are moving right into our trap! They have (5, 8), (6, 8), and then they hit the edge or our incoming body! This is beautiful!\n\nThe apple at (6, 8) looks enticing for them, but we might just take it first in just a couple of turns as we swoop down the right wall! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n### 2. Immediate Threat Assessment\n\n1.  **Our Collision Risk (Head at 8, 9):** We are on the top edge, safe from our body to the left (7, 9).\n2.  **Opponent's Next Move Prediction (Snake #0 at 4, 8):**\n    *   **UP (to 4, 9):** **DANGER!** Collision with our body segment (4, 9)! A potential death move, but they might be desperate enough to try it, which would *insta-kill them*. Unlikely.\n    *   **DOWN (to 4, 7):** Safe. Keeps them centered.\n    *   **LEFT (to 3, 8):** Collision with their body! \u274c They won't move backward.\n    *   **RIGHT (to 5, 8):** Safe. Continues along the wall we are building. This is the most likely move. They try to escape to the right!\n\nIf they move to (5, 8), they are still under our shadow. If they move down to (4, 7), they are giving us the top right corner entirely for free. Both options are great for us!\n\n### 3. Move Analysis (Head at 8, 9)\n\nTHE PLAN REMAINS: Secure the corner, drop the bomb. \ud83d\udca3\n\n1.  **UP (to 8, 10):** **DANGER!** Out of bounds! \u274c\n2.  **DOWN (to 8, 8):** Safe. This is tempting, but we haven't secured the full corner at (9, 9) yet! We need that control.\n3.  **LEFT (to 7, 9):** **DANGER!** Collision with our body segment (7, 9)! \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT (to 9, 9):** **SAFE!** This guarantees total control of the top-right quarter of the board. This is the cornerstone of the Killbox! We need this square, Chat!\n\nThis move is non-negotiable! Completes the initial enclosure!\n\n### 4. Strategic Outlook (Corner Captured)\n\nNext turn, we secure the first apple on the right side.\n\n*   **T16 (Now):** Move RIGHT (to 9, 9). Corner secured.\n*   **T17:** Move DOWN (to 9, 8). **APPLE!** (+1 point, max length extension!)\n*   **T18:** Move DOWN (to 9, 7). **APPLE!**\n*   **T19:** Move DOWN (to 9, 6). **APPLE!**\n\nIf Snake #0 takes (5, 8) right now, they will be facing the right wall. They can only go RIGHT to (6, 8) (apple), or DOWN to (5, 7). They are running out of headroom quickly, as our body just extended all the way to (2, 8).\n\nWe are dominating the northern half of the board. We will drop down the entire right side, collect those three guaranteed apples, and then start sweeping across the bottom! We are running away with this game! We LOVE to see it! \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

That's the OPPONENT'S BODY! He's got a segment at (4,9)! \u274c INSTANT DEATH! DENIED!\n*   **DOWN to (4, 7)**: Is it safe? That's MY OWN BODY! My neck is at (3,8)! But wait...

(4,7) is FREE! \u2705\n*   **LEFT to (3, 8)**: Is it safe? That's MY OWN NECK! My body list says the first segment behind my head is (3,8)! \u274c CRASHING INTO MYSELF! NO WAY!\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 8)**: Is it safe? Board shows a '.'! That's EMPTY! \u2705\n\nCHAT, WE HAVE TWO SAFE MOVES! DOWN and RIGHT! \ud83d\ude0e WE ARE NOT TRAPPED LIKE LAST TURN! THIS IS OUR CHANCE! LET'S BREAK FREE!\n\n**ANALYZING THE SITUATION:** \ud83e\udde0\nOur head is at (4,8). The enemy head is at (8,9). Last turn we predicted he'd go DOWN to (7,8), and guess what? The board shows him there! WE CALLED IT! \ud83c\udfaf Now he's at (7,8). His options:\n*   UP to (7,9): That's his own neck! \u274c\n*   DOWN to (7,7): Empty! \u2705\n*   LEFT to (6,8): Empty! \u2705\n*   RIGHT to (8,8): Empty! \u2705\n\nHe has THREE safe moves! He could try to cut us off or go for apples.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** \ud83d\udcdd\nWE NEED TO ESCAPE THE TOP EDGE! Our body is long and vertical on the left, blocking us. Our best bet is to move SOUTH towards the center where there are apples like (4,4) and (6,3). Moving DOWN to (4,7) opens up more options next turn (LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN) to start maneuvering. Moving RIGHT to (5,8) keeps us on the top edge, which is dangerous with the enemy nearby. The priority is to GET AWAY FROM THE WALL and get into open space to outmaneuver him! DOWN is the escape route!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** \ud83d\ude80\nDOWN gets us away from the edge and towards apples. RIGHT keeps us pinned up top. THE CHOICE IS CLEAR! TIME TO DIP!\n\nDOWN",

The right wall is officially open for business! Let's get these apples! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n### 1. Board State Review (Turn 17 / 150)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 9)\n*   Body: [(8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)] (Length 7)\n*   Apples collected: 6.\n\n**OPPONENT CHECK (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (4, 7)\n*   Body: [(4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5)] (Length 6)\n*   Apples: 5.\n\nPredicted: Snake #0 moved DOWN to (4, 7)! A safe move, but one that gives us *absolute* freedom up top! They are now stuck between the horizontal wall we built and our incoming vertical descent! The trap is set!\n\nWe have three apples immediately on the path: (9, 8), (9, 7), and (9, 6)! This is a guaranteed $+3$ length and $+3$ score boost! We are about to pull ahead significantly!\n\n### 2. Immediate Threat Assessment\n\n1.  **Our Collision Risk (Head at 9, 9):** We are in the corner, safe from our body to the left (8, 9).\n2.  **Opponent's Next Move Prediction (Snake #0 at 4, 7):**\n    *   **UP (to 4, 8):** Into their own body segment (4, 8). Unlikely. \u274c\n    *   **DOWN (to 4, 6):** Safe. Keeps them centered.\n    *   **LEFT (to 3, 7):** Into their own body segment (3, 7). Unlikely. \u274c\n    *   **RIGHT (to 5, 7):** Safe. They might be aiming for the apple at (6, 8) or trying to escape to the right side *before* we block the entire exit!\n\nIf they move RIGHT to (5, 7), they are directly in the path of the bottom half of our descent, but still far enough away. If they move DOWN to (4, 6), they are giving us the middle lane of the board. They are playing passively, which is exactly what we want!\n\n### 3. Move Analysis (Head at 9, 9)\n\nTHE PLAN: Secure the guaranteed apples and build the right wall.\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 10):** **DANGER!** Out of bounds! \u274c\n2.  **DOWN (to 9, 8):** **SAFE!** This is an **APPLE**! First of the sequence! \ud83c\udf4e\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 9):** **DANGER!** Collision with our body segment (8, 9). \u274c\n4.  **RIGHT (to 10, 9):** **DANGER!** Out of bounds! \u274c\n\nThe move is definitively DOWN. We secure this apple, extend our length to 8, and block off the top-right quarter even further!\n\n### 4. Strategic Outlook (Domination Phase)\n\nWe are entering the domination phase.\n\n*   **T17 (Now):** Move DOWN (to 9, 8). **APPLE!** (+1 point). Length 8.\n*   **T18:** Move DOWN (to 9, 7). **APPLE!** (+1 point). Length 9.\n*   **T19:** Move DOWN (to 9, 6). **APPLE!** (+1 point). Length 10.\n\nBy T19, we will have secured the entire right edge down to row 6 with a massive body, and we will be at 9 apples! Our opponent will be desperately trying to find space in the center-left. Once we secure these three, we can pivot towards the cluster of apples around (4, 4), (8, 4), and (5, 2)!\n\nWe are running the board, Chat! The opponent is absolutely boxed in!

It opens up future moves DOWN, RIGHT, or even UP next turn (since our body will have moved). It also gets us closer to apples like (6,3) and (4,4). This feels like a safe, space-creating move!\n*   **DOWN to (4,6)**: This also moves us down, but it pins us closer to the left wall and our own long body. Our options next turn would be mostly LEFT/DOWN, which might be restrictive. It feels a bit more limiting.\n\nWe need to avoid getting trapped by our own body and stay agile! Moving RIGHT gives us more room to breathe and maneuver. We can't let him get too far ahead on apples!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** \ud83d\ude80\nRIGHT feels like the power move! It gives us more options, keeps us in the game, and sets us up to contest the board center! LET'S PUSH RIGHT AND PUT PRESSURE ON HIM!\n\nRIGHT",

Our body is now a beautiful, terrifying wall along the top right! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\n### 1. Board State Review (Turn 18 / 150)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 8)\n*   Body: [(9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)] (Length 8)\n*   Apples collected: 7. We are in the lead, baby! \ud83e\udd47\n\n**OPPONENT CHECK (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (5, 7)\n*   Body: [(4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6)] (Length 6)\n*   Apples: 5.\n\n**CURRENT OBJECTIVE:** Complete the wall down the right side. We have two more guaranteed apples right below us: (9, 7) (APPLE) and (9, 6) (APPLE)! This is the power play!\n\n### 2. Immediate Threat Assessment\n\nWe are dominating the right side. The opponent is boxed in the center-left.\n\n**Opponent's Head (5, 7):**\nWhere can Snake #0 go? They are stuck between our massive body wall (rows 8 and 9 are almost entirely ours) and their own body on the left.\n\n*   **UP (to 5, 8):** Safe, open space. Could aim for (6, 8) or try to get around our head and body.\n*   **DOWN (to 5, 6):** Safe, open space.\n*   **LEFT (to 4, 7):** Collision with their own body segment (4, 7)! UNLIKELY. \u274c\n*   **RIGHT (to 6, 7):** Safe, open space. They might try to get to (9, 7) or (9, 6), but we are already there!\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 either moves UP to (5, 8) in a desperate attempt to hug the edge of our wall or moves RIGHT to (6, 7) to try and open up the middle. Regardless, they are far away from our current path. The only way for them to collide with us is if they move RIGHT to (6, 7) and then we move LEFT, which we definitely aren't planning yet!\n\n### 3. Move Analysis (Head at 9, 8)\n\nWe are at (9, 8)! Time to pick up the next apple! \ud83c\udf4f\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 9):** **DANGER!** Collision with our body segment (9, 9). \u274c We just moved from there!\n2.  **DOWN (to 9, 7):** **SAFE!** This is an **APPLE**! Second of the sequence! \ud83c\udf4e\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 8):** Safe, but this takes us off the apple path and away from our strategic wall creation. Not optimal.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 10, 8):** **DANGER!** Out of bounds! \u274c\n\nThe move is definitively DOWN. We secure this apple, extend our length to 9, and essentially claim the top half of the right edge, making a perfect trap for our opponent!\n\n### 4. Strategic Outlook (Trap Setting Phase)\n\nThe plan remains simple and ruthlessly effective:\n\n*   **T18 (Now):** Move DOWN (to 9, 7). **APPLE!** (+1 point). Length 9.\n*   **T19:** Move DOWN (to 9, 6). **APPLE!** (+1 point). Length 10.\n\nAfter T19, we will be at (9, 6) with 9 apples. We will have effectively divided the board. Our opponent will be restricted to the area with x-coordinates < 6.\n\nOnce we hit (9, 6), we have options. We can continue pressing DOWN towards (9, 0) or we can pivot LEFT along row 6 to pick up the remaining apples in the middle like (6, 3), (4, 4), and (8, 4), which would be much easier if we came from the bottom edge.\n\nFor now, the priority is to keep the pressure on and extend our body, making their world smaller and smaller! No mercy, Chat! Watch them panic when they realize they can't cross the equator!\n\nDOWN",

Let's analyze:\n\n*   **UP to (5, 8)**: Is it safe? Board shows a '.'! That's EMPTY! \u2705\n*   **DOWN to (5, 6)**: Is it safe? Board shows a '.'! That's EMPTY! \u2705\n*   **LEFT to (4, 7)**: Is it safe? \u274c That's our OWN BODY! Our body segment is at (4,7)! CRASH! DENIED!\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 7)**: Is it safe? Board shows a '.'! That's EMPTY! \u2705\n\nCHAT! WE'RE STILL IN THIS! THREE SAFE MOVES! UP, DOWN, and RIGHT! \ud83d\ude24\n\n**ANALYZING THE OPPONENT'S NEXT MOVE!** \ud83d\udc0d\nSnake #1 head is at (9, 8). His options:\n*   UP to (9, 9)? That's his own neck! \u274c\n*   DOWN to (9, 7)? That's an APPLE 'A'! He's 100% going for that! It's safe and gives him points! He'll be at 8 apples!\n*   LEFT to (8, 8)? That's EMPTY! \u2705 He *could* go there, but why pass up a free apple? He's greedy!\n*   RIGHT? CAN'T, he's on the edge!\n\nHe's PROBABLY going DOWN to (9,7) for the apple!\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** \ud83d\udcdd\nHe's about to be at 8 apples, we're at 5. We need to close the gap FAST! We need to path towards the closest apple cluster! Look at the board! There's a juicy one at (6,3) and another at (4,4). Moving DOWN or RIGHT gets us closer to that general area. Moving UP takes us towards the top wall where HE is dominating. We need to avoid a head-on collision with him while we're smaller!\n\n*   **RIGHT to (6,7)**: This moves us towards the center-right. Our next moves could be DOWN towards (6,3) or RIGHT/UP. It keeps us flexible!\n*   **DOWN to (5,6)**: This also moves us down towards the apple zone. It's a solid move, but our body is snaking around (3,6) to (4,7), so we have to be careful not to box ourselves in on the left side.\n*   **UP to (5,8)**: This feels risky, chat! It pushes us closer to the opponent's territory. He's at (9,8) and might move left along the top. We don't want to get pinched against the top wall!\n\nThe play is to AVOID him and go for the CONTENT! RIGHT or DOWN are the moves!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** \ud83d\ude80\nRIGHT feels stronger! It gives us more open space to maneuver and a clearer path down towards the apples. We can't get trapped! Let's push RIGHT and start our farming run! WE'RE COMING FOR THAT LEAD!\n\nRIGHT",

We grabbed that apple at (9, 7) and reinforced the wall! \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d What a play!\n\n### 1. Board State Review (Turn 19 / 150)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 7)\n*   Body: [(9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)] (Length 9)\n*   Apples collected: 8. We are still in the lead, baby! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**OPPONENT CHECK (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (6, 7)\n*   Body: [(5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7)] (Length 6)\n*   Apples: 5.\n\n**CURRENT OBJECTIVE:** We are now at the choke point! Our previous plan was to grab the guaranteed apple at (9, 6). Let's see if that still works and if we can use this wall we built to finish this rival off!\n\n### 2. Immediate Threat Assessment & Opponent Prediction\n\nSnake #0's Head is at (6, 7). They are currently trapped between their body and ours.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 (Head at 6, 7):\n*   **UP (to 6, 8):** Safe. Moves toward the center top.\n*   **DOWN (to 6, 6):** Safe. Moves toward the bottom center.\n*   **LEFT (to 5, 7):** Collision with their own body segment (5, 7)! DANGER! \u274c\n*   **RIGHT (to 7, 7):** Safe. This is the move that *might* try to challenge our wall dominance and get central positioning.\n\nGiven our wall, Snake #0 is trying to escape being boxed in. A move to (7, 7) is aggressive, trying to get into the space we just left, but they'd still be trapped beneath our massive tail on row 8 and 9. A move to (6, 8) or (6, 6) seems safer for them.\n\n**CRITICAL CHECK:** Can Snake #0 collide with us? We are at (9, 7). If we move DOWN to (9, 6), and they move RIGHT to (7, 7), we are still two spaces apart. No immediate head collision risk.\n\n### 3. Move Analysis (Head at 9, 7)\n\nWe are at (9, 7)! We have a golden apple at (9, 6)! This is the final step in securing the right-side wall!\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 8):** **DANGER!** Collision with our body segment (9, 8)! \u274c (Self-collision, moving backwards into space we just left)\n2.  **DOWN (to 9, 6):** **SAFE!** This is an **APPLE**! \ud83c\udf4e Secures our 9th apple!\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 7):** Safe, but this abandons the apple and the immediate strategic goal of wall completion. Not optimal.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 10, 7):** **DANGER!** Out of bounds! \u274c\n\nThe move is definitively DOWN. We collect the apple, grow to length 10, and put up an impenetrable barrier along x=9 from y=7 to y=9.\n\n### 4. Strategic Outlook: Boxing Them In!\n\nAfter this move, we will be at (9, 6), length 10. Our body will run down the entire right edge/top edge.\n\n**The Trap is Set!**\nThe opponent (Snake #0) is currently confined primarily to the area where x < 8, and y < 8. Our body is a strong border.\n\nNext turn (Turn 20), we will be at (9, 6). We have a few options:\n1.  **Continue DOWN to (9, 5):** Keep pressing the wall to the bottom edge.\n2.  **Pivot LEFT to (8, 6):** Start eating the remaining apples across the bottom half (like (8, 4), (4, 4), (6, 3)).\n\nGiven the board still has many apples down the left and bottom side, pressing our wall further DOWN is the best way to secure space and severely limit their options. We must force them to crash or starve them of space. We look great! Let's keep the pressure on!\n\nDOWN",

He just ate the apple at (9,7)! His options:\n*   UP to (9, 8)? That's his own neck! \u274c\n*   DOWN to (9, 6)? That's an APPLE 'A'! He's 100% going for that! It's safe and gives him points! He'll be at 9 apples!\n*   LEFT to (8, 7)? That's EMPTY! \u2705 He *could* go there, but why pass up a free apple? He's greedy!\n*   RIGHT? CAN'T, he's on the edge!\n\nHe's PROBABLY going DOWN to (9,6) for the apple! That moves him AWAY from us! GOOD!\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** \ud83d\udcdd\nHe's about to be at 9 apples, we're at 5. We need to close the gap! The play is to AVOID him and FARM! Look at the board! There's an apple RIGHT ABOVE US at (6,8)! That's the closest one! Eating that gets us to 6 apples and keeps us growing! Moving UP is the AGGRESSIVE CONTENT MOVE! Moving DOWN or RIGHT takes us towards other apples, but they're further away. Why pass up a free meal right next to our head? We gotta be efficient! After eating it, we'll be at (6,8). We need to plan an escape route to avoid getting trapped against the top wall, but we can worry about that next turn. GET THE CONTENT!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** \ud83d\ude80\nUP! LET'S GET THAT APPLE! WE'RE NOT PLAYING SCARED! WE'RE PLAYING TO WIN! GET THAT BAG!\n\nUP",

We're up 9 to 6! That's a 3-apple lead! Can we close this out? I think so!\n\n### 1. Board State Review (Turn 20 / 150)\n\n**OUR SNAKE (ID: 1):**\n*   Head: (9, 6)\n*   Body: [(9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)] (Length 10)\n*   Apples collected: 9. We are a mighty kraken on the board! \ud83d\udc19\n\n**OPPONENT CHECK (Snake #0):**\n*   Head: (6, 8) (They moved UP from (6, 7)!)\n*   Body: [(6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7)] (Length 7)\n*   Apples: 6.\n\n**CURRENT OBJECTIVE:** The opponent tried to break out by moving UP to (6, 8), but they are still heavily constrained by our body (x=8 and x=9 are ours!). We need to continue the entrapment strategy. The goal is to squeeze them into the central-left area and force a collision with their own body or the wall. We also have a ton of apples down the left side we need to secure!\n\n### 2. Immediate Threat Assessment & Opponent Prediction\n\nSnake #0's Head is at (6, 8).\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 (Head at 6, 8):\n*   **UP (to 6, 9):** **DANGER!** Collision with our body segment (6, 9)! \u274c\n*   **DOWN (to 6, 7):** Safe, moves back to where their body segment is *right now* but their tail will vacate (3, 7), so this is safe assuming they don't eat.\n*   **LEFT (to 5, 8):** Safe. Moves toward the center.\n*   **RIGHT (to 7, 8):** Safe. This is the only move challenging our side, trying to get into the open space at (8, 8).\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 cannot go up (blocked by us). They will likely try to move RIGHT to (7, 8) to escape, or LEFT to (5, 8) to get more central, or DOWN to (6, 7) to stall.\n\nIf we move LEFT, we put ourselves on the same row as the enemy at (8, 6). If they move RIGHT to (7, 8), we are still safe.\n\n### 3. Move Analysis (Head at 9, 6)\n\nWe are at (9, 6). We have four options:\n\n1.  **UP (to 9, 7):** **DANGER!** Collision with our body segment (9, 7)! \u274c (Self-collision, moving backwards)\n2.  **DOWN (to 9, 5):** **SAFE.** Continues the wall construction, securing the right edge completely. Leads to (9, 5), then perhaps (9, 4), and then a Left traverse. This maintains maximum territory control.\n3.  **LEFT (to 8, 6):** **SAFE.** This threatens the opponent's main escape path into the center. This move also lines us up perfectly for the A at (6, 3) and (4, 4).\n    *   *Head-on risks if we go LEFT:* If the enemy goes RIGHT to (7, 8), no collision. If they go DOWN/LEFT, no collision. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 10, 6):** **DANGER!** Out of bounds! \u274c\n\n**DOWN vs. LEFT:**\n\n*   **DOWN:** Safe, reinforces the wall. Slows our advance strategically but guarantees total right-side domination. Safe follow-ups (DOWN to 9, 5, then LEFT to 8, 5).\n*   **LEFT:** Aggressive expansion. Puts immediate pressure on the opponent's escape route, opening up the board center sooner. We can use the leftward path to grab apples (8, 4), (6, 3), (4, 4).\n\nGiven the opponent is trapped and we have a commanding lead, the sooner we can get into the open field and start eating the available center apples, the better. Moving LEFT to (8, 6) keeps us far away from the opponent's head at (6, 8) for now, but puts us in a dominating position to continue our sweep. We can control the space *under* the opponent.\n\nLet's go LEFT! We shift our wall pressure inward.\n\n### 4. Strategic Outlook: The Sweep\n\nMove: LEFT to (8, 6).\nNext, we want to clear the apples across the bottom 5 rows, moving from right to left while maintaining our dominant wall presence along the top (y=9).\n\nNext turn (Turn 21):\n*   We will be at (8, 6).\n*   Apples we are aiming for: (8, 4), (6, 3), (4, 4).\n*   If we go DOWN to (8, 5) then (8, 4) (APPLE!), it puts maximum distance between ourselves and the opponent while scoring.\n\nThis LEFT move secures the transition from the wall-building phase to the Apple-sweeping phase! Let's get that content!\n\nLEFT",

NOW his head is likely at (9,6), meaning he just grew! That long body is scary! Where can he go?\n*   UP to (9,7)? That's his own neck! \u274c\n*   DOWN to (9,5)? EMPTY! \u2705\n*   LEFT to (8,6)? EMPTY! \u2705\n\nHe can go DOWN or LEFT. He's on the edge, so he might want to move into the open board. BUT CHAT, LOOK AT THE BOARD! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f There's an apple at (8,4)! Is he smart enough to path towards it? Maybe! We gotta be CAREFUL! If he goes LEFT to (8,6), he's moving AWAY from us for now. GOOD!\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF:** \ud83d\udcdd\nWe are in a TOUGH spot! We're trapped against the top wall with the opponent's massive body to our north! We need to ESCAPE THIS CORNER! Our only safe moves are LEFT and RIGHT. Which one gives us more options? Going LEFT to (5,8) puts us closer to the center and the cluster of apples on the left side (like (4,4), (3,6), (1,9)). Going RIGHT to (7,8) takes us along the top edge, closer to the apple at (8,4), but also closer to the opponent's potential path! The opponent is LONG, which means he's less maneuverable. We're shorter and more agile! We need to use that! Let's break for the center and farm those apples! We can't fight him head-on when he's this big! We need to play the long game, survive, and let him potentially make a mistake!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** \ud83d\ude80\nLEFT! GET US AWAY FROM THIS WALL AND TOWARDS THE PROMISE LAND OF APPLES! WE LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY!\n\nLEFT",

Immediate Threat Assessment & Opponent Prediction\n\nSnake #0's Head is at (5, 8).\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 (Head at 5, 8):\n*   **UP (to 5, 9):** **DANGER!** Collision with our body segment (5, 9)! \u274c\n*   **DOWN (to 5, 7):** Safe, but they move into their own body space (which is vacating), or they could hit the body segment at (5, 7) if they didn't eat. Since they didn't eat, their tail vacated (3, 8), so moving to (5, 7) is safe. This keeps them constrained.\n*   **LEFT (to 4, 8):** Safe, but they move into their own body space (which is vacating), or they could hit the body segment at (4, 8) if they didn't eat. Safe since their tail vacated (3, 8). This is also near our body at (4, 9).\n*   **RIGHT (to 6, 8):** Safe, but they move into their own body segment (safe since they didn't eat). This is their best move to regain central ground.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 is completely bottled up. They can only move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT into their own previous body positions. They will try to coil, or maybe try to go RIGHT to (6, 8) to escape our massive ceiling. They are focusing on survival, but they have no good apple nearby.\n\n### 3. Move Analysis (Head at 8, 6)\n\nWe are at (8, 6). We need to secure the (8, 4) apple and maintain pressure.\n\n1.  **UP (to 8, 7):** **SAFE.** This moves us closer to the danger zone, but it's an open space. It gives us an option to swing LEFT to (7, 7) and further wall off the opponent.\n2.  **DOWN (to 8, 5):** **SAFE.** This is the move to start our great apple sweep! It sets us up perfectly for (8, 4) (APPLE!). This keeps us far from the opponent and maximizes our scoring opportunity.\n3.  **LEFT (to 7, 6):** **SAFE.** This is aggressive pressure. It moves us close to the center and closer to the (6, 3) apple. It keeps our options open for DOWN or LEFT movement.\n    *   *Head-on risks:* If Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (6, 8), we are still two cells away. No immediate head-on risk.\n4.  **RIGHT (to 9, 6):** **DANGER!** Collision with our body segment (9, 6)! \u274c (Self-collision, moving backwards)\n\n**DOWN vs. LEFT:**\n\n*   **DOWN (to 8, 5):** The safest, highest-reward move. It takes us directly toward the apple at (8, 4) and maintains a safe distance from the opponent. We are dominating the map, so safety and apples are the priority. \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **LEFT (to 7, 6):** More aggressive. It cuts the board in half higher up, putting more immediate pressure on the opponent. However, the (8, 4) apple is immediately accessible if we go DOWN. Why delay the content?\n\nWe are going for the guaranteed content and territory sweep! Snake #0 is already trapped. Let's eat these apples!\n\n### 4. Strategic Outlook: The Apple Sweep\n\nMove: DOWN to (8, 5).\nNext, we immediately grab (8, 4). Then our goal is to continue moving sweep LEFT (e.g., to 7, 4) and down, boxing the enemy in further while clearing the board below y=7. This is the optimal, safe, high-score move.\n\nLet's do this, Chat! Send it!\n\nDOWN",

We got outplayed!\n\nSince there are no safe moves... the game might be over for us this turn. But the rules say we have to pick a move. We have to choose one, even if it kills us.\n\nWe have to pick... RIGHT. It was the last move we considered. We go out swinging. \ud83d\ude14\n\nRIGHT",
