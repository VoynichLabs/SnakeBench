(3, 8) is directly above me. Going UP gets an apple immediately and puts me at (3, 8) next turn.  \n\nPotential risk: After eating apple at (3, 8), my body will be [(3, 8), (3, 7)] next turn, so tail at (3, 7). That means I can\u2019t reverse into (3, 7) next turn, but that\u2019s fine.  \n\nOther apples are farther away; no reason to avoid the closest apple.  \n\n**Future self note:**  \nAfter eating apple at (3, 8), consider moving toward other apples at (2, 8) or (0, 8) if safe, but watch enemy snake #1\u2019s position for collisions. Keep space to avoid dead ends.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Enemy at (7,7) can move UP to (7,8), RIGHT to (8,7), DOWN to (7,6), LEFT to (6,7). None reach (1,9) in one move. So safe from collision.\n\n**Safety check for RIGHT (3, 9):**  \n- Same logic, safe from immediate death.\n\n---\n\n**Future mobility after move:**\n\nLEFT to (1, 9):  \nNext turn possible moves from (1, 9): UP off board, DOWN to (1,8) empty, LEFT to (0,9) empty, RIGHT to (2,9) empty but was my previous head position (now vacated). Actually body will move forward next turn: current body is (2,8),(3,8),(3,7). After I move to (1,9), body becomes [(1,9),(2,8),(3,8),(3,7)]? Wait, length is 4, so tail stays (3,7), head (1,9), body segments shift: new body: [(1,9),(2,9),(2,8),(3,8)]? Let\u2019s track:  \n\nCurrent: head (2,9), body[0]=(2,8), body[1]=(3,8), body[2]=(3,7).  \nMove to (1,9): new head (1,9), old head becomes body[0]=(2,9), old body[0] becomes body[1]=(2,8), old body[1] becomes body[2]=(3,8), old body[2]=(3,7) is tail and is removed? No, we only remove tail if we didn\u2019t eat apple. We didn\u2019t eat apple this turn (no apple at (1,9) or (3,9)), so length stays 4, tail (3,7) is removed, body shifts: new body = [(1,9),(2,9),(2,8),(3,8)]. Yes.  \n\nSo from (1,9) next turn:  \nUP off board \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN to (1,8) \u2192 empty (not in new body).  \nLEFT to (0,9) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT to (2,9) \u2192 that\u2019s in my new body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn (DOWN, LEFT).\n\nRIGHT to (3, 9):  \nAfter move to (3,9), body: head (3,9), then (2,9),(2,8),(3,8). Tail (3,7) removed.  \n\nFrom (3,9) next turn:  \nUP off board \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN to (3,8) \u2192 that\u2019s my body \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT to (2,9) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT to (4,9) \u2192 empty.  \nSo only 1 safe move next turn (RIGHT). That\u2019s risky.\n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nApple at (0,8) is close to (1,9) if I go LEFT: from (1,9) next turn DOWN to (1,8) then LEFT to (0,8) eats it.  \nApple at (1,4) far.  \nApple at (3,1) far.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (3,9), nearest apple is (0,8) farther.\n\nLEFT gives better mobility (2 moves next turn) and paths toward apple (0,8).\n\n---\n\n**Enemy considerations:**  \nEnemy at (7,7), no threat now. They might go for apple at (7,1) or (9,0). Not relevant to my immediate move.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,9), go DOWN to (1,8) (safe, opens path to apple (0,8) in 2 moves). Then LEFT to (0,8) to eat apple and grow, then continue toward lower left apples while keeping options open. Avoid trapping myself along top row.\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Good.  \n\n2. **DOWN to (1,6):**  \n   Next turn from (1,6):  \n   - UP\u2192(1,7): empty (body moved), safe.  \n   - DOWN\u2192(1,5): safe.  \n   - LEFT\u2192(0,6): safe.  \n   - RIGHT\u2192(2,6): safe.  \n   4 safe moves \u2014 maximizes options.  \n\n3. **RIGHT to (2,7):**  \n   Next turn from (2,7):  \n   - UP\u2192(2,8): safe.  \n   - DOWN\u2192(2,6): safe.  \n   - LEFT\u2192(1,7): safe.  \n   - RIGHT\u2192(3,7): safe.  \n   4 safe moves \u2014 but moves away from nearest apple (0,8).  \n\n---\n\n**Risk assessment:**  \nLEFT to (0,7) gets me closer to apple (0,8) while keeping good options next turn.  \nDOWN to (1,6) gives more next-turn moves but delays apple.  \nGiven enemy has 0 apples and I have 3, I can play safe but also aim to grow faster to secure lead.  \n\nApple at (0,8) is safe to eat next turn if I go LEFT now, because:  \nMy body currently at (1,8),(1,9),(2,9) will move with me when I move LEFT, so (0,8) will remain apple until I step on it. Eating it will grow my tail by 1 segment at the end of next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nIf I go LEFT now to (0,7), next turn I can eat apple at (0,8) by moving UP, unless enemy somehow reaches there (unlikely). After eating, my new tail end will be at (2,9) still? Wait, need to track growth:  \nCurrent body: head\u2192(1,7), then (1,8),(1,9),(2,9).  \nMoving LEFT: new head (0,7), body shifts: (1,7)\u2192(1,8)\u2192(1,9), tail stays (2,9) unless I eat apple. Eating apple next turn means tail stays same length but new segment added at tail after movement? Actually in Snake, when you eat apple, you grow at next move: after moving onto apple, you don\u2019t remove tail that turn. So length increases by 1 after that turn.  \n\nBut anyway, going LEFT now seems fine.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT gets apple next turn safely, keeps 3 moves next turn, enemy far away.  \n\nLEFT",

Check each direction for immediate death\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (0,9):  \n  Board shows (0,9) empty (no snake body). Not off board. Safe? Wait \u2014 the board ASCII shows at row 9: `. T . . . . . . . .` \u2014 so column 0, row 9 is `.` (empty). Yes, safe immediately.  \n  But check: my body ends at (1,9). (0,9) is not part of my body. Enemy snake #1 is at (7,2), far away. No immediate collision.\n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (0,7):  \n  That\u2019s my own body segment (second segment). Immediate death. **Not safe.**\n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (-1,8): off board. **Not safe.**\n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (1,8):  \n  That\u2019s my own body (fourth segment? Let\u2019s check: body list is [(0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9)] \u2014 yes, (1,8) is third element in list after head? Wait: head is (0,8), body[0] = (0,7), body[1] = (1,7), body[2] = (1,8), body[3] = (1,9). So (1,8) is body segment. Immediate death. **Not safe.**\n\nSo only **UP** is safe this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 2. But wait \u2014 enemy snake movement risk\n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (7,2), body none. They can move UP to (7,3), DOWN to (7,1) \u2014 but (7,1) has an apple, so if they go DOWN they\u2019ll eat it and grow to length 2 next turn. They could also move LEFT to (6,2) or RIGHT to (8,2).  \nNone of those moves bring them near (0,9) this turn. So no head-on collision risk with me.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple reachability\n\nGoing UP to (0,9) does not land on an apple. Apples are at (1,4), (3,1), (7,1), (9,0), (1,5). From (0,9), next turn my only safe move might be RIGHT to (1,9) because DOWN to (0,8) is my neck (body after move), LEFT off board, UP off board. So indeed, from (0,9) only RIGHT is safe next turn. That\u2019s okay \u2014 planning ahead: after (1,9), I can go DOWN to (1,8)? Wait, (1,8) will be my body then? Let\u2019s trace:  \nIf I move UP now to (0,9), my body becomes: new head (0,9), old head (0,8) becomes first body segment, then (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9) shifts? Wait \u2014 I have length 5 now (4 body + head). When moving without eating apple, head moves, tail stays same length, so last body segment disappears. Actually, let\u2019s check: current body length 4, total snake length 5. Moving without eating: new head at (0,9), add old head (0,8) to front of body, remove last body segment (1,9). So new body: [(0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (1,8)]. Yes, (1,9) is gone.  \n\nSo after move UP:  \nHead: (0,9)  \nBody: [(0,8), (0,7), (1,7), (1,8)]\n\nThen next turn from (0,9):  \n- DOWN to (0,8) \u2192 body segment, death.  \n- LEFT off board.  \n- UP off board.  \n- RIGHT to (1,9) \u2192 empty, safe.  \n\nSo indeed only RIGHT next turn. Then from (1,9), options: DOWN to (1,8) \u2192 body segment (yes, (1,8) is in body after previous move), LEFT to (0,9) \u2192 body segment, UP off board, RIGHT to (2,9) safe. So only RIGHT again from (1,9). That\u2019s getting restrictive but eventually I can go down the right side.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Alternative check \u2014 any oversight?\n\nCould staying alive by UP now lead to trap later? Possibly, but no choice \u2014 only one move is safe. So must take it.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for future:**  \nAfter UP to (0,9), must go RIGHT to (1,9), then RIGHT to (2,9). From (2,9), can go DOWN to (2,8) toward apples (1,5) and (1,4). Need to be careful not to box self in. Enemy far away for now.\n\n---\n\nUP",

Future planning after RIGHT\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1, 9):  \nNew head: (1, 9)  \nNew body: [(0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (1, 7)] (tail (1, 8) removed)\n\nFrom (1, 9) next turn:\n- UP \u2192 off board\n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 empty (not in new body)\n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 9) \u2192 body segment (0, 9)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 9) \u2192 empty\n\nSo next turn, DOWN and RIGHT are safe. That\u2019s better than being stuck at (0, 9) last turn.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Apple accessibility\n\nFrom (1, 9), apples at (1, 5) and (1, 4) are vertically below me. I can start moving DOWN carefully, avoiding boxing myself. Enemy is far away on the bottom half.\n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan:**  \nMove RIGHT now to (1, 9). Next turn, go DOWN toward apples (1, 5) and (1, 4), but watch for body traps. Keep moving to maintain options.\n\nRIGHT",

This would kill me. \u274c  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (1, 7): Check board: (1,7) is empty (look at board state row 7, column 1: '.'), and not in my body. \u2705  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0, 8): That's my own body segment (fourth segment). \u274c  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 8): Empty (row 8, col 2: '.'), not in my body, not off board. \u2705  \n\nSo safe moves are **DOWN** and **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy movement**\n\nEnemy snake #1: head at (7, 3), body [(7, 2)], length 2.  \nThey are far away, so no immediate collision risk unless they move toward me in 4+ moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Apples and future options**\n\nApples at: (1,4), (3,1), (9,0), (1,5), (0,1).\n\nFrom (1,8):  \n- **DOWN** to (1,7): Closer to apples (1,5) and (1,4) vertically. From (1,7), next safe moves likely DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT? Let\u2019s check:  \n  - UP would go to (1,8) which will be empty after I move, so safe.  \n  - LEFT to (0,7) is my tail segment now, but next turn my tail moves? Wait: if I eat an apple, my tail stays; if I don't, my tail moves forward. Currently length 5, so if I move down without eating, my tail (0,7) moves to (0,6), so (0,7) becomes empty. So LEFT from (1,7) could be safe next turn.  \n  - RIGHT to (2,7) safe.  \n  - DOWN to (1,6) safe.  \n  So from (1,7) all four directions could be safe next turn.  \n\n- **RIGHT** to (2,8): Moves away from apples (1,5) and (1,4), but toward apple (3,1) eventually. From (2,8):  \n  - UP to (2,9) safe (empty).  \n  - DOWN to (2,7) safe.  \n  - LEFT to (1,8) will be empty after I move, safe.  \n  - RIGHT to (3,8) safe.  \n  Also all four directions safe next turn.  \n\nBoth keep options open.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Strategic choice**\n\nI have 4 apples, enemy has 1. I want to get to 50 apples to win.  \nClosest apples are at (1,5) and (1,4).  \nGoing **DOWN** progresses toward them directly.  \nGoing **RIGHT** goes horizontally, then I'd need to go down later, maybe slightly longer path.\n\nAlso, from (1,7) I can go DOWN to (1,6), then (1,5) to eat apple in 2 moves.  \nFrom (2,8), I'd need 3 moves minimum to reach (1,5) or (1,4).\n\nSo **DOWN** is better for apple collection.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan note for next turn**\n\nPlan: After moving DOWN to (1,7), next turn go DOWN again to (1,6) unless something changes. That puts me one step from apple at (1,5). Keep checking enemy movement; they are far, so focus on eating apples quickly. Avoid trapping myself near top-left later; after eating (1,5) and (1,4), consider moving right toward center to have more space.\n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nDOWN",

Check each move for immediate death\n\n**UP** \u2192 (1, 4) \u2192 Occupied by my own body segment (tail end at (1, 9) but body wraps down from head? Wait, order is head first: head (1,3), then (1,4) is next body segment \u2192 so UP into (1,4) would hit my own body immediately \u2192 **dead**.  \n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 Empty on board, not off-grid, not occupied by my body, not occupied by enemy body (enemy at (5,6) and (5,5)). Safe.  \n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (0, 3) \u2192 Empty on board, safe.  \n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 Empty on board, safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. UP is suicide.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Consider enemy movement\n\nEnemy head: (5, 6), body: [(5,5)] length 2.  \nEnemy could move UP to (5,7), DOWN to (5,5) \u2192 hits own body \u2192 so DOWN not allowed for them. LEFT (4,6) has apple \u2014 they might go there to eat it. RIGHT (6,6) empty. UP (5,7) empty. So enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNo immediate collision risk for me because enemy is far away.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Apples proximity and future options\n\nApples:  \n- (0, 1): 2 moves away via LEFT then DOWN.  \n- (2, 1): 2 moves away via RIGHT then DOWN.  \n- (3, 1): 3 moves away via RIGHT\u00d72 then DOWN.  \n- (4, 6): far.  \n- (9, 0): far.\n\nMy snake is long (length 7). Need to avoid trapping myself.  \n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (1, 2): next turn I could go LEFT (0,2) or RIGHT (2,2) or DOWN (1,1) \u2014 all likely safe except maybe (1,1) later? Actually (1,1) is fine next turn. So 3 options. Gets me closer to (0,1) and (2,1).  \n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (0, 3): next turn could go UP (0,4) \u2014 empty, DOWN (0,2) \u2014 empty, RIGHT (1,3) \u2014 empty. Also 3 options. Puts me closer to apple (0,1).  \n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (2, 3): next turn could go UP (2,4) empty, DOWN (2,2) empty, LEFT (1,3) empty. Also 3 options. Closer to apple (2,1) and (3,1).  \n\nAll three safe moves give similar future flexibility.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Long-term planning\n\nMy tail extends to (1,9). My body occupies x=1 from y=3 to y=9. That\u2019s a vertical column on the left side. Moving DOWN or LEFT or RIGHT will start moving away from that column, which is good to avoid boxing myself in later.  \n\nI should probably aim to collect the nearest apples while leaving space to loop around without hitting myself.  \n\nGiven my length, going DOWN now to (1,2) leaves my head near bottom soon \u2014 but bottom row has apple (9,0) far away, but also (0,1) and (2,1) nearby. Going DOWN sets up to go LEFT next to (0,2) then DOWN to (0,1) to eat apple. That path seems safe and doesn\u2019t risk hitting myself soon.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nGo DOWN now to (1,2). Next turn, likely go LEFT to (0,2) (unless something changes), then DOWN to (0,1) to eat apple. This path avoids my body and keeps options open.\n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nDOWN",

Let's consider the four possible directions:\n- UP: Moving up would put us at (4, 8), which is on the board and safe from immediate collision. This move keeps options open and moves us closer to the apple at (7, 8).\n- DOWN: Moving down would put us at (4, 6), which is on the board and safe. However, this move does not bring us closer to any apple and could limit future options.\n- LEFT: Moving left would put us at (3, 7), which is on the board, safe, and closer to an apple at (3, 1).

          "rationale": "Let\u2019s look at the current state.  \n\n**My head:** (4, 1)  \n**My body:** [(3, 1), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)]  \n**Apples:** (9, 0), (0, 1), (7, 8), (0, 9), (1, 0)  \n**Enemy snake #1:** head at (3, 9), body [(3, 8), (4, 8)]  \n\n---\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Immediate safety from (4, 1):**  \n- **UP** to (4, 2): empty \u2192 safe.  \n- **DOWN** to (4, 0): empty \u2192 safe.  \n- **LEFT** to (3, 1): my own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- **RIGHT** to (5, 1): empty \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nNo apple adjacent to (4, 1). Closest apple horizontally:  \n- (9, 0) far right bottom.  \n- (0, 1) far left but blocked by my body in column 1.  \n- (1, 0) bottom left but blocked by my body.  \n- (7, 8) top right.  \n- (0, 9) top left.  \n\nSo apples are not immediate; I need to path toward one while avoiding traps.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy head at (3, 9). Possible moves:  \nUP to (3, 10) \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN to (3, 8) \u2192 its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT to (2, 9) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT to (4, 9) \u2192 empty.  \nSo enemy\u2019s only safe moves: LEFT or RIGHT.  \n\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (2, 9), it\u2019s far from me. If enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 9), still far (y=9 vs my y=1). No immediate collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future options after each safe move:**  \n\n**UP to (4, 2):**  \nNext head at (4, 2). Possible moves:  \nUP (4, 3): empty.  \nDOWN (4, 1): my old head \u2192 unsafe (body will be there next turn).  \nLEFT (3, 2): empty.  \nRIGHT (5, 2): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**DOWN to (4, 0):**  \nNext head at (4, 0). Possible moves:  \nUP (4, 1): old head \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (4, -1): off board \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT (3, 0): empty.  \nRIGHT (5, 0): empty.  \nSo 2 safe moves next turn \u2192 riskier.  \n\n**RIGHT to (5, 1):**  \nNext head at (5, 1). Possible moves:  \nUP (5, 2): empty.  \nDOWN (5, 0): empty.  \nLEFT (4, 1): old head \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (6, 1): empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nSo DOWN is worse for future flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term planning:**  \nMy long vertical body occupies column 1 rows 1\u20136, blocking left side. I should avoid moving left into that column soon.  \nBetter to go toward open right side where apples (9, 0) and (7, 8) are.  \n\nFrom (4, 2), I can go UP/RIGHT later toward (7, 8).  \nFrom (5, 1), I can go DOWN toward (9, 0) or UP toward (7, 8).  \n\nBoth UP and RIGHT keep options open.  \nBut RIGHT moves me directly away from my body and into more open space (columns 5\u20139 empty).  \nUP moves toward top apples but also toward enemy at y=9 eventually.  \n\nEnemy is small (length 3) and far away, so not an immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid dead ends:**  \nDOWN gives fewer options. Between UP and RIGHT:  \nRIGHT seems slightly better because:  \n- It increases distance from my long body (reduces risk of trapping myself).  \n- It moves toward (9, 0) apple path.  \n\nBut UP also fine. Let\u2019s check board:  \nFrom (4, 2), next turn safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 all open. From (5, 1), next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT \u2014 all open.  \n\nActually both are similarly safe.  \n\nLooking at apple positions:  \n(9, 0) is at bottom right. To reach it soon, moving DOWN or RIGHT helps.  \nFrom (5, 1), I could go DOWN next turn to (5, 0), then RIGHT toward (9, 0).  \nFrom (4, 2), going toward (9, 0) would require DOWN later, which might be blocked by my body later.  \n\nGiven my body in column 1, moving right opens more paths to both (9, 0) and (7, 8).  \n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan:**  \nMove RIGHT now to (5, 1), then next turn likely DOWN to (5, 0) to approach (9, 0), while keeping enemy in mind later.  \n\nRIGHT",

My body occupies the entire row y=1 from x=1 to x=6, plus a vertical segment at x=1 going up to y=3.\n\n**Enemy snake #1:**  \nHead at (0,9), body at (1,9), (2,9), (3,9). Far away from me.\n\n**Apples:** (9,0), (0,1), (7,8), (1,0), (5,5).\n\n---\n\n**Possible moves from (7,1):**  \n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (7,2) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (7,0) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (6,1) \u2013 my own body, death.  \n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (8,1) \u2013 empty, safe.\n\nSo LEFT is eliminated immediately.\n\n---\n\n**Check for immediate dangers with remaining moves:**  \n\n- **UP (7,2):**  \n  - Not off board.  \n  - Not my body (my body at (7,2)? No, body at (6,1),(5,1), etc., and (1,2),(1,3) only).  \n  - Not enemy body (enemy far).  \n  - Could enemy snake #1 move into (7,2) this turn? Their head at (0,9), impossible in one move. So safe from head-on collision.  \n\n- **DOWN (7,0):**  \n  - Not off board.  \n  - Not my body.  \n  - No enemy body there.  \n  - Could enemy move into (7,0)? No, too far.  \n\n- **RIGHT (8,1):**  \n  - Not off board.  \n  - Not my body.  \n  - No enemy body.  \n  - Safe from head-on collision (enemy at (0,9), impossible to reach (8,1) in one move).  \n\nSo all three moves are safe.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan / strategy note:**  \nMy snake is long (length 9), so I must avoid boxing myself in.  \nApples:  \n- (9,0) is far bottom-right, could go DOWN then RIGHT eventually.  \n- (0,1) is occupied by my body at (1,1) next to it, so can't get that apple without moving around.  \n- (7,8) is far top.  \n- (1,0) is near my tail but blocked by my body at (1,1) above it.  \n- (5,5) is middle, accessible.\n\nBest to keep space: moving UP opens more space above.  \nRIGHT goes toward (9,0) but also toward right edge, which might limit future moves if I hug the wall.  \nDOWN goes toward (9,0) as well but also toward bottom edge.  \n\nI should avoid trapping myself along edges with my long body. Currently my body is on left side mostly; moving RIGHT gives me more room on the right side. But moving UP gives more vertical space.\n\nLet's check future safe moves from each candidate:\n\nFrom (7,2):  \n- UP \u2192 (7,3) free  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,1) my body (occupied by old head position? Wait, after moving, body shifts: old head becomes new neck, so (7,1) will be my body next turn, so DOWN from (7,2) next turn would be suicide unless tail moves. Tail at (1,3) now, after moving UP, tail stays at (1,3) unless I eat apple. So (7,1) is body next turn. So from (7,2), DOWN not safe next turn.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,2) free  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,2) free  \nSo from (7,2), 3 safe moves next turn.\n\nFrom (7,0):  \n- UP \u2192 (7,1) body (same issue: old head becomes body), so not safe next turn.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board (death)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,0) free  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,0) free  \nSo from (7,0), only 2 safe moves next turn (LEFT, RIGHT).\n\nFrom (8,1):  \n- UP \u2192 (8,2) free  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,0) free  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,1) body (old head position) \u2192 not safe  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,1) free  \nSo from (8,1), 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nUP and RIGHT both give 3 safe moves next turn. DOWN gives only 2 safe moves next turn (and puts me on bottom edge).  \nBetween UP and RIGHT:  \nUP moves toward center more, RIGHT moves toward right edge.  \nApple at (5,5) is closer if I go UP eventually.  \n\nAlso, apple at (7,8) is far but UP is general direction.  \nRIGHT leads to apple at (9,0) but I'd need to go DOWN after, possibly boxing myself.\n\nBetter to go UP now for more open space.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7,2), consider moving toward (5,5) via LEFT/UP, but be careful not to trap myself in my own body loop. Keep space to maneuver.\n\n---\n\nUP",

No.  \n- Occupied by enemy body? Snake #1 body: [(0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9)] \u2192 none at (7, 4).  \n- Could enemy head move there? Enemy head at (1, 8) could move UP to (1, 9) (occupied by its own body), DOWN to (1, 7), LEFT to (0, 8) (its own body), RIGHT to (2, 8). So enemy won't be at (7, 4) next turn.  \nSafe.\n\nCheck LEFT (6, 3):  \n- Inside board: yes  \n- My body? No.  \n- Enemy body? No.  \n- Enemy head could move there? Enemy at (1, 8) \u2192 impossible distance.  \nSafe.\n\nCheck RIGHT (8, 3):  \n- Inside board: yes  \n- My body? No.  \n- Enemy body? No.  \n- Enemy head could move there? No.  \nSafe.\n\nSo UP, LEFT, RIGHT are all safe immediately.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future options and apples**  \n\nFrom (7, 4): neighbors: (7, 5), (6, 4), (8, 4), (7, 3) (my old head). Next turn, body will be at (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), ... So (7, 3) blocked. So possible future moves: UP to (7, 5), LEFT to (6, 4), RIGHT to (8, 4). All could be safe depending on board then.\n\nFrom (6, 3): neighbors: (6, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2), (7, 3) blocked. So future moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT possible.\n\nFrom (8, 3): neighbors: (8, 4), (9, 3), (8, 2), (7, 3) blocked. So future moves: UP, RIGHT, DOWN possible.\n\nApples: closest apple to each candidate:  \n- (7, 4) \u2192 apple at (7, 8) is 4 steps away vertically, (5, 5) is |7-5|+|4-5|=3.  \n- (6, 3) \u2192 (5, 5) distance |6-5|+|3-5|=3, (7, 8) is 6 steps.  \n- (8, 3) \u2192 (5, 5) distance 5, (7, 8) distance 5, (9, 0) distance 11.\n\nSo (7, 4) and (6, 3) both 3 steps from (5, 5), but (7, 4) is also closer to (7, 8) and central.\n\nAlso note: apple at (0, 1) is far; apple at (1, 0) is near my tail but risky area because enemy snake is at top left.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Avoid dead-ends and enemy risk**  \nEnemy snake #1 is far away at (1, 8), so no immediate collision threat.  \nMy tail is long, so I need space to maneuver. (7, 4) feels more open because right side of board is less cluttered. (6, 3) is closer to my own long body column at x=1..7, y=1.\n\nLet\u2019s check board visual: my body occupies y=1 from x=1 to 7, plus (7, 2). So moving to (6, 3) leaves me near that wall of body, possibly limiting future moves if I go further left into more confined area.\n\n(7, 4) \u2192 open above: row y=5 empty except apple at (5,5).

If the enemy snake moves in a way that creates a safe path to an apple, prioritize eating the apple. Otherwise, focus on avoiding collision and maintaining flexibility for future moves.\n\nDOWN",

No.  \n- Occupied by enemy body? Snake #1 body: [(1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 9)] \u2192 none at (7, 5).  \n- Could enemy head move there? Enemy head at (1, 7) could move UP to (1, 8) (its own body), DOWN to (1, 6), LEFT to (0, 7), RIGHT to (2, 7). So enemy won't be at (7, 5) next turn. Safe.\n\nCheck LEFT (6, 4):  \n- Inside board: yes  \n- My body? No.  \n- Enemy body? No.  \n- Enemy head could move there? Enemy at (1, 7) \u2192 impossible distance. Safe.\n\nCheck RIGHT (8, 4):  \n- Inside board: yes  \n- My body? No.  \n- Enemy body? No.  \n- Enemy head could move there? No. Safe.\n\nSo UP, LEFT, RIGHT are all safe immediately.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future options and apples**  \n\nFrom (7, 5):  \nNeighbors: (7, 6), (6, 5), (8, 5), (7, 4) (will be occupied by my body next turn). So future moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT possible.  \n\nFrom (6, 4):  \nNeighbors: (6, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 4) blocked. So future moves: UP, LEFT, DOWN possible.  \n\nFrom (8, 4):  \nNeighbors: (8, 5), (9, 4), (8, 3), (7, 4) blocked. So future moves: UP, RIGHT, DOWN possible.\n\nApples: closest apple to each candidate:  \n- (7, 5) \u2192 apple at (5, 5) distance |7-5|+|5-5|=2, apple at (7, 8) distance 3.  \n- (6, 4) \u2192 apple at (5, 5) distance |6-5|+|4-5|=2, apple at (7, 8) distance |6-7|+|4-8|=5.  \n- (8, 4) \u2192 apple at (5, 5) distance |8-5|+|4-5|=4, apple at (7, 8) distance |8-7|+|4-8|=5.\n\nSo (7, 5) and (6, 4) both 2 steps from (5, 5), but (7, 5) is also closer to (7, 8).\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Avoid dead-ends and enemy risk**  \nEnemy is far at (1, 7), no immediate threat. My body occupies y=1 from x=2 to 7, plus (7, 2), (7, 3). Moving LEFT to (6, 4) puts me closer to that wall of body, possibly limiting future moves if I go further left/down. Moving UP to (7, 5) opens up more space above and keeps me central. (8, 4) is okay but further from apples.\n\nAlso note: apple at (1, 0) is near my tail but risky because enemy snake is in top-left area (head at (1, 7)). Apple at (0, 1) also risky. Apple at (9, 0) far.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note**  \nPlan: Go for (5, 5) apple next. From (7, 5), I can go LEFT twice to (5, 5) safely if path is clear. Need to check next turn if moving LEFT from (7, 5) is safe (should be). After eating (5, 5), consider moving toward (7, 8) apple. Avoid getting trapped by my own long body on left side.\n\n**Final move choice**  \nUP",

So no head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\nAll three moves are safe immediately.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Evaluate apple proximity**  \n- LEFT (5, 5) \u2192 lands directly on apple (5, 5), eat and grow.  \n- UP (6, 6) \u2192 distance to (5, 5) = 2, to (7, 8) = 3.  \n- DOWN (6, 4) \u2192 distance to (5, 5) = 2, to (7, 8) = 5.  \n\nLEFT gets an apple immediately.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety after each move**  \nIf LEFT to (5, 5) and eat apple:  \nMy new body length increases by 1, so tail stays at (4, 1), head at (5, 5), body: [(6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1)]? Wait, order: head is first, then previous head (6,5) becomes second segment, etc. Actually after eating apple, new head at (5,5), old head (6,5) becomes second segment, rest as is, tail stays (4,1) because we grow by not moving tail. So body: [(5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1)] length 10.  \nNext turn from (5,5): possible moves: UP (5,6), DOWN (5,4), LEFT (4,5), RIGHT (6,5) (occupied by my new second segment). So RIGHT blocked. Others open unless enemy moves there. Enemy far away, low risk.  \n\nIf UP to (6, 6):  \nBody: [(6,6), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1)] length 9.  \nNext turn from (6,6): possible moves: UP (6,7), DOWN (6,5) occupied, LEFT (5,6), RIGHT (7,6). Three options. Apple (7,8) is closer but (5,5) still reachable.  \n\nIf DOWN to (6, 4):  \nBody: [(6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1)] length 9.  \nNext turn from (6,4): possible moves: UP (6,5) occupied, DOWN (6,3), LEFT (5,4), RIGHT (7,4) occupied by my body. Only DOWN and LEFT safe. That\u2019s fewer options.  \n\nSo DOWN reduces future moves more.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nEating apple now is good \u2014 increases score, lengthens body slightly but also moves head away from my long body column at x=7.  \nEnemy is far and small, not an immediate threat.  \nAfter eating (5,5), I can consider moving UP toward (7,8) or eventually (9,0) or (0,1).  \nAvoid getting trapped near my own body at bottom-left.\n\nLEFT seems optimal: immediate apple, safe next moves.\n\n**Plan for next turn**: From (5,5), likely go UP or LEFT to avoid moving back into my body at (6,5), and head toward (7,8) apple.\n\nLEFT",

So no head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\nAll three moves are safe immediately.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Evaluate apple proximity**  \nApples: (9, 0), (0, 1), (7, 8), (1, 0), (4, 7)  \n- UP (5, 7): distance to (4, 7) = 1, to (7, 8) = 3.  \n- LEFT (4, 6): distance to (4, 7) = 1, to (7, 8) = 4.  \n- RIGHT (6, 6): distance to (7, 8) = 2, to (4, 7) = 3.  \n\nClosest apple is (4, 7) at distance 1 from UP and LEFT. RIGHT is farther from both closest apples.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety after each move**  \nIf UP to (5, 7):  \nNew body: [(5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1)] length 11 (since we ate apple last turn? Wait, I had 9 apples before, now 9 apples still, so length = 9 + 1 = 10? Actually: apples collected = 9 means body length = 9 + 1 = 10 segments. But in current body list I count 10 segments including head. So no growth last turn, length stays 10. After moving, tail moves off (5,1), new body length 10.)  \nNext turn from (5, 7): possible moves: UP (5, 8), DOWN (5, 6) occupied, LEFT (4, 7) apple, RIGHT (6, 7). Three options open, one leads to apple.\n\nIf LEFT to (4, 6):  \nNew body: [(4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1)] length 10.  \nNext turn from (4, 6): possible moves: UP (4, 7) apple, DOWN (4, 5), LEFT (3, 6), RIGHT (5, 6) occupied. Three options open, one leads to apple.\n\nIf RIGHT to (6, 6):  \nNew body: [(6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1)] length 10.  \nNext turn from (6, 6): possible moves: UP (6, 7), DOWN (6, 5) occupied, LEFT (5, 6) occupied, RIGHT (7, 6). Only two safe moves next turn (UP, RIGHT), slightly riskier.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \n(4, 7) is closest apple, reachable in 1 move from UP or LEFT.  \nUP (5, 7) leaves me more central and has path to (7, 8) after possibly eating (4, 7).  \nLEFT (4, 6) also good but edges left side, fewer apples there after (4, 7).  \nRIGHT is less safe next turn (only 2 moves).  \n\nBest: UP to (5, 7), then next turn go LEFT to (4, 7) to eat apple, opening growth and more space.\n\nEnemy is far left, not a threat now. My body along bottom left may be a future trap if I loop too soon, but currently fine.\n\n**Plan for next turn**: From (5, 7), if apple at (4, 7) still there, go LEFT to eat it. If not, consider UP toward (7, 8) or RIGHT to stay safe. Avoid moving back into my body at (5, 6).\n\nUP",

Moving UP gets closer to it while staying flexible. My long body is mostly in lower half, so moving up opens more space.

Only DOWN safe \u2192 1 safe move (dangerous).  \n\nIf RIGHT to (3, 9):  \nNew body: [(3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4)] length 12.  \nNext turn from (3, 9): possible moves: UP off board (dead), DOWN (3, 8) occupied by my body, LEFT (2, 9) occupied, RIGHT (4, 9) empty. Only RIGHT safe \u2192 1 safe move (dangerous).  \n\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT leave only 1 safe move next turn.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Which is less risky?**  \nLEFT \u2192 only DOWN (1, 8) safe next turn. That cell is currently empty, but enemy snake #1 is at (1, 5) and could move up to (1, 6) or (2, 5) etc. It\u2019s not immediately threatening (1, 8) this turn.  \nRIGHT \u2192 only RIGHT (4, 9) safe next turn. That cell is empty and far from enemy.  \n\nHowever, after RIGHT to (3, 9), next turn RIGHT again to (4, 9), then from (4, 9) possible moves: DOWN (4, 8) occupied by my body, LEFT (3, 9) occupied, RIGHT (5, 9) empty, UP off board \u2192 again only 1 safe move (RIGHT). This leads me along top edge toward right side, eventually toward apple (7, 8) from above.  \n\nLEFT to (1, 9) then DOWN to (1, 8) leads closer to enemy snake #1 and board left edge with fewer options.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nRIGHT seems better because:  \n1. Moves toward apple (7, 8).  \n2. Enemy snake #1 is on left side, so moving right reduces interaction risk.  \n3. Moving along top edge (3,9)\u2192(4,9)\u2192(5,9)\u2192\u2026 gives a path toward (7,8) and possibly (8,5) later.  \n4. Even with only 1 safe move next turn, I can reassess after enemy moves; maybe DOWN from (3,9) becomes safe if my tail moves away from (3,8) by then (but currently occupied).  \n\nI\u2019ll choose RIGHT.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,9), likely only RIGHT (4,9) is safe. Prepare to continue right along top row toward apple (7,8). Watch enemy snake #1\u2019s movement\u2014if it moves toward (2,5) or (1,4), it\u2019s still far away. Avoid getting trapped at top-right corner later; consider turning down toward apple (8,5) when close.\n\nRIGHT",

No risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is (7, 8) at distance ~2.24.  \nFrom (5, 9):  \n- DOWN to (5, 8) \u2192 distance to (7, 8) = 2.24 (same as now, but now aligned horizontally).  \n- RIGHT to (6, 9) \u2192 distance to (7, 8) = 1.41 (closer).  \n\nRIGHT gets me closer to (7, 8) in Euclidean distance, but I must consider path: from (6, 9) next turn only DOWN is safe (UP off board, LEFT into body, RIGHT off board), so I'd be forced DOWN to (6, 8), which is still fine for approaching (7, 8).  \n\nDOWN to (5, 8) leaves more options next turn: LEFT (4,8) is body, RIGHT (6,8) empty, UP (5,9) body, DOWN (5,7) body. So only RIGHT from (5, 8) would be safe next turn, which also goes toward (7, 8).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety comparison:**  \nRIGHT (6, 9) \u2192 next turn only DOWN safe \u2192 path narrow but leads toward apple.  \nDOWN (5, 8) \u2192 next turn only RIGHT safe \u2192 same narrowing but slightly more central.  \n\nBoth lead to one safe move next turn, but RIGHT gets me closer to the apple now. However, RIGHT puts me at the top edge, which could be risky if I need to escape later.  \n\nGiven my long body, staying near the top edge might limit future escape routes. But the apple at (7, 8) is near the top edge anyway.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Consider enemy movement:**  \nEnemy is far away, unlikely to interfere in next 2 turns.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**  \nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are safe and lead toward the nearest apple. RIGHT gets me slightly closer now and sets me up to go DOWN next turn toward apple. DOWN keeps me one row lower, which might be slightly safer for future flexibility.  \n\nI'll choose **RIGHT** because it's more direct toward (7, 8) and my previous plan was to go right then down.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 9), only DOWN is safe. Take DOWN to (6, 8), then from there likely RIGHT to (7, 8) to eat apple if still there. If enemy moves into that area, reassess.\n\nRIGHT",

Actually (5,8) currently empty, but is it safe next turn? My body after moving DOWN to (6,8) will have (6,9) as first body segment, (5,9) second, etc. (5,8) is not in my body. So LEFT safe.  \nRIGHT to (7,8) \u2192 apple possibly still there.  \nDOWN to (6,7) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo from (6,8), safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. More options than from (7,9).  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety:**  \nRIGHT to (7,9) gives me next turn safe moves: RIGHT and DOWN (two options).  \nDOWN to (6,8) gives me next turn safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN (three options).  \n\nSo DOWN is better for future flexibility.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Enemy movement:**  \nEnemy might go DOWN to (1,0) for apple or LEFT to (0,1) for apple. Either way, far from me.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI want apple (7,8). From (6,8), I can go RIGHT to (7,8) next turn if still there. From (7,9), I can go DOWN to (7,8) next turn. But DOWN now gives more options next turn.  \n\nGiven my long body, staying near edges reduces options, but (6,8) is not top edge, so better.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN gives more options next turn and keeps me closer to central area while still moving toward apple (7,8).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 8), if apple (7,8) still there, go RIGHT to eat it. If not, choose safe move avoiding dead ends, maybe DOWN or LEFT depending on enemy position.  \n\nDOWN",

Both are far from my possible moves \u2192 no head-on risk.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is (7, 8) at distance 1 (RIGHT). Also (8, 5) and (9, 1) are farther.  \nRIGHT gets apple immediately \u2192 growth by 1, score increases, and body extends.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future safety after each move:**  \nIf RIGHT to (7, 8):  \nNext turn head at (7, 8), body will be [(6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9), \u2026 plus new tail from growth].  \nFrom (7, 8), possible moves:  \nUP\u2192(7, 9) currently empty, but after my move, (6, 9) is my body, (7, 9) still empty \u2192 safe.  \nDOWN\u2192(7, 7) empty \u2192 safe.  \nLEFT\u2192(6, 8) will be my body next turn \u2192 deadly.  \nRIGHT\u2192(8, 8) empty \u2192 safe.  \nSo three safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good.  \n\nIf DOWN to (6, 7):  \nNext turn from (6, 7): UP\u2192(6, 8) my body \u2192 deadly; LEFT\u2192(5, 7) my body \u2192 deadly; RIGHT\u2192(7, 7) empty; DOWN\u2192(6, 6) empty \u2192 only two safe moves.

Deadly next turn. So LEFT is a trap.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Conclusion:**  \nRIGHT gets apple, gives good future options.  \nDOWN gives fewer options but still safe this turn.  \nLEFT leads to certain death next turn.  \n\nBest move: RIGHT to eat apple (7, 8).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple, my body grows by 1 segment. From (7, 8), avoid going LEFT into (6, 8) which will be my body. Prefer UP to (7, 9) or RIGHT to (8, 8) to stay flexible, possibly targeting (8, 5) next.

It's also a move that keeps us safe from collision with our own body.\n- LEFT: This move is possible and would put us at (3, 2), which is our own body, so it's not a viable option as moving directly backwards into our own body counts as hitting ourselves.\n- RIGHT: Moving right would put us at (5, 2), which is on the board and does not immediately provide an apple.\n\nConsidering the goal of moving closer to apples while keeping future options open, moving UP seems to be a favorable option as it allows us to move away from the board edge and potentially position ourselves for future growth. Additionally, moving UP does not immediately block us from reaching any of the apples.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue to maneuver towards the nearest remaining apples, prioritizing moves that keep us safe from collision and position us for potential growth.

From (8,2), three safe moves will be available next turn (DOWN to (8,1), LEFT to (7,2), RIGHT to (9,2)).\n- **LEFT** to (7,3): empty, safe, but moves away from the cluster of apples at column 9.

With a significant apple lead (12 vs. 5), prioritizing safety and future flexibility is wise.\n\n**Comparison:**  \nDOWN and LEFT both provide three safe follow-up moves, but DOWN actively approaches the nearest apples (9,2), (9,1), and (9,0). RIGHT offers fewer future options and is riskier due to the edge.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nMove DOWN to (8,2) this turn. Next turn, move RIGHT to (9,2) to eat the apple.

Safe unless enemy moves there simultaneously.  \n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (7,2) \u2192 empty, safe.  \n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,2) \u2192 contains an apple, safe unless enemy head moves there simultaneously.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy possible moves from (4,3):**  \n- UP: (4,4) empty  \n- DOWN: (4,2) occupied by its own body (second segment) \u274c  \n- LEFT: (3,3) empty  \n- RIGHT: (5,3) empty  \n\nSo enemy can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Risk of head-on collision:**  \n- If I go RIGHT to (9,2), enemy can't reach it in one turn (max 1 cell movement). So no head-on collision risk from enemy #1 this turn.  \n- If I go DOWN to (8,1), enemy can't reach it in one turn.  \n- If I go LEFT to (7,2), enemy can't reach it in one turn.  \n\nSo all three moves are safe from simultaneous head-on collision with enemy #1.  \n\n---\n\n**Board constraints:**  \nApple at (9,2) is very close. If I go RIGHT, I eat it and grow. My tail is at (3,9), so growth means my body extends but tail stays put next turn.  \n\nIf I eat apple at (9,2), my new head will be at (9,2), my body will be [(9,2), (8,2), (8,3), ...]. Next turn from (9,2), possible moves:  \n- UP: (9,3) empty  \n- DOWN: (9,1) empty  \n- LEFT: (8,2) occupied by my new second segment (previous head) \u274c  \n\nSo from (9,2) after eating, only UP and DOWN would be safe next turn \u2014 that's a reduced choice (2 moves).  \n\n---\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8,1):  \nFrom (8,1), next turn:  \n- UP: back to (8,2) empty (since I moved)  \n- DOWN: (8,0) empty  \n- LEFT: (7,1) empty  \n- RIGHT: (9,1) empty  \n\nAll 4 moves available next turn \u2014 very flexible.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (7,2):  \nFrom (7,2), next turn:  \n- UP: (7,3) empty  \n- DOWN: (7,1) empty  \n- LEFT: (6,2) empty  \n- RIGHT: (8,2) empty  \n\nAlso all 4 moves available.  \n\n---\n\n**Closest apples:**  \n(9,2) is distance 1 away (RIGHT).  \n(9,1) distance 2, (9,0) distance 3.  \n(4,7) and (1,9) are farther.  \n\nGiven my long body, I must be careful about trapping myself. Eating (9,2) now puts me on the right edge with fewer options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Safety check:**  \nGoing RIGHT to eat apple: next turn only UP/DOWN safe. Could go DOWN to (9,1) to eat another apple, then only UP/LEFT safe from (9,1) \u2014 but LEFT would be (8,1) which might be occupied by then if my body moves? Let's simulate:  \nTurn 50: move RIGHT to (9,2), eat apple, grow. Body: new head (9,2), then (8,2), (8,3), ..., tail (3,9).  \nTurn 51: move DOWN to (9,1), eat apple, grow. Body: head (9,1), (9,2), (8,2), (8,3),..., tail still (3,9)? Wait, growth means tail doesn't move, so length increases. Actually, tail stays until moves happen without eating. Let's not overcomplicate: key point is that being against the right edge limits escape routes.  \n\n---\n\n**Better plan:**  \nGo DOWN to (8,1) this turn, keeping all options open. Next turn, from (8,1) I can go RIGHT to (9,1) to eat that apple, or go to (9,2) later. This gives more flexibility and avoids immediate edge constraint.  \n\nAlso, enemy is far away, no threat yet.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nFrom (8,1), next turn head to (9,1) to eat apple, then possibly (9,0), then move left along bottom to avoid trapping myself. Keep enemy in mind but maintain flexibility.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

No risk this turn.  \nIf I go DOWN to (8,0) or LEFT to (7,1), also safe from enemy head-on collision.  \n\n---\n\n**Eating apple considerations:**  \nRIGHT to (9,1) gets an apple immediately, but puts me on right edge. Next turn from (9,1):  \n- UP: (9,2) empty (apple there)  \n- DOWN: (9,0) empty (apple there)  \n- LEFT: (8,1) empty after I move  \n- RIGHT: off board \u274c  \n\nSo 3 safe moves next turn, but still on edge.

I'm currently wrapping top-right area.  \nEnemy is at (5,3), length 6.  \nIf I eat (9,1) and then (9,2), I'll be stuck along right edge for two turns, reducing escape options.  \n\nBetter to keep flexibility:  \nLEFT to (7,1) keeps all options open, moves me toward center, away from edge trap.  \nFrom (7,1) next turn I can still reach apples (9,1) or (9,0) in two moves, or (4,7) in more moves.  \n\nAlso, enemy is not an immediate threat, but staying in open space is safer.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nMove LEFT to (7,1) this turn.  \nNext turn, assess if going toward (9,1) is safe or if enemy is approaching. Possibly go UP to (7,2) then RIGHT to (8,2) etc., or head toward (4,7) if path is clear. Avoid getting pinned on edges with long body.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Check possible moves from (5, 2) for immediate death:**  \n\n- **UP** \u2192 (5, 3): Occupied by enemy body (5, 3) \u2192 **DEATH**.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5, 1): Empty on board (checked: not in my body, not enemy body). Safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4, 2): Empty. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 2): Occupied by my body (first segment after head) \u2192 **DEATH**.  \n\nSo safe moves: **DOWN**, **LEFT**.  \n\n---\n\n**2. Consider enemy movement from (5, 7) and potential collisions:**  \n\nEnemy safe moves from (5, 7):  \n- UP (5,8): empty.  \n- DOWN (5,6): own body \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT (4,7): apple, empty.  \n- RIGHT (6,7): empty.  \n\nSo enemy could go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.  \n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (5,1), enemy could go LEFT to (4,7) (apple), or UP to (5,8), or RIGHT to (6,7). No chance of head-on collision next turn because far apart.  \n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (4,2), enemy could still go anywhere except DOWN.  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision possible this turn since enemy is at (5,7), I\u2019m at (5,2), and we can\u2019t meet in one move.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Future options after each safe move:**  \n\n**LEFT to (4, 2):**  \nNext turn possible moves from (4,2):  \n- UP (4,3): enemy body (4,3) \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN (4,1): safe.  \n- LEFT (3,2): safe.  \n- RIGHT (5,2): currently my head\u2019s old position, will be empty next turn except if enemy moves there? Enemy at (5,7) can\u2019t reach (5,2) in one move. So safe.  \n\nSo from (4,2) next turn: safe moves DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n**DOWN to (5, 1):**  \nNext turn from (5,1):  \n- UP (5,2): empty next turn (my old head) \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (5,0): safe.  \n- LEFT (4,1): safe.  \n- RIGHT (6,1): my body at (6,1) now, but will it move? Let\u2019s trace: My body moves each turn: head to new spot, each segment moves forward.  \nAfter I move DOWN to (5,1), my body shifts: new body = [(5,1), (5,2), (6,1), (7,1), ...]. Wait, careful:  \nCurrent body: head (5,2), then (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), ...  \nIf I move DOWN to (5,1), new head (5,1), then old head (5,2) becomes second segment, then (6,2) becomes third, (6,1) becomes fourth, etc. So (6,1) is now the 4th segment. Next turn, if I move RIGHT to (6,1), that\u2019s occupied by my 4th segment \u2192 death. So RIGHT from (5,1) next turn is unsafe.  \n\nCheck: Next turn from (5,1):  \nUP (5,2): empty (since my old head moved, body shifted, (5,2) is now my neck, but will it move away when I move from (5,1)? Actually after I move to (5,1), body = [(5,1), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), ...]. So (5,2) is occupied by my 2nd segment. So UP into (5,2) next turn is into my own body \u2192 death.  \n\nLet\u2019s check properly:  \nCurrent body: head (5,2) \u2192 (6,2) \u2192 (6,1) \u2192 (7,1) \u2192 (8,1) \u2192 (8,2) \u2192 ...  \nIf I move DOWN to (5,1): new head (5,1), then old head (5,2) becomes segment 2, old (6,2) becomes segment 3, old (6,1) becomes segment 4, etc.  \n\nSo next turn from (5,1):  \n- UP (5,2): my segment 2 \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN (5,0): safe (empty).  \n- LEFT (4,1): safe (empty now and likely next turn unless enemy moves there, unlikely).  \n- RIGHT (6,1): my segment 4 \u2192 death.  \n\nSo only 2 safe moves next turn from (5,1): DOWN and LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**LEFT to (4,2)** next turn safe moves: DOWN (4,1), LEFT (3,2), RIGHT (5,2) (empty next turn because my old head at (5,2) moved to (4,2), so (5,2) is free). That\u2019s 3 safe moves.  \n\nSo LEFT gives more future flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Apples:**  \nClosest apple to (5,2) is (4,7) but far. (9,2) is closer in y but far right.  \nLEFT moves me toward left side where apple (1,9) is far up.  \nBut immediate apple gathering isn\u2019t urgent; staying alive and flexible is key.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Avoid enemy path:**  \nEnemy might go LEFT to (4,7) to eat apple. That\u2019s far from me. No threat of collision soon.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (4,2), I can go LEFT next turn to (3,2) to avoid enemy body at (4,3) and (5,3), opening path to bottom-left area which is less crowded. The right side is full of my own body.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nLEFT gives more future options (3 vs 2 safe moves next turn) and avoids moving into more crowded right side.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

No.  \n  Enemy body: not in [(4,7), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]? Yes.  \n  Board bounds: y=3 is within 0\u20139.  \n  Enemy head collision prediction: enemy head at (4,8) could move to (4,9), (5,8), (4,7), (3,8). It won\u2019t be at (3,3) next turn.  \n  So UP seems safe from immediate death.  \n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 1)  \n  Check collisions:  \n  My body: not in my body list? Yes.  \n  Enemy body: not in enemy body list? Yes.  \n  Board bounds: y=1 is within 0\u20139.  \n  Enemy head won\u2019t be there.  \n  Safe.  \n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 2)  \n  Check collisions:  \n  My body: not in my body list? Yes.  \n  Enemy body: not in enemy body list? Yes.  \n  Board bounds: x=2 is within 0\u20139.  \n  Safe.  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 2)  \n  Check collisions:  \n  My body: (4,2) is the first segment behind my head \u2192 moving directly backwards into own body \u2192 DEATH.  \n  So RIGHT is **not safe**.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Consider future options and apples  \n\n**Apples:**  \n- (9,0), (9,1), (9,2) are far right, near my tail\u2019s old area.  \n- (1,9) top left far away.  \n- (9,9) top right far away.  \n\nCurrently, I\u2019m at (3,2). My tail end is at (8,7). I have a long body blocking some paths.  \n\n**UP (3,3):**  \nNext turn from (3,3): possible moves: UP (3,4), LEFT (2,3), RIGHT (4,3), DOWN (3,2) \u2014 but (3,2) will be empty next turn (since head moved). So all 4 might be free unless enemy moves there.  \n\n**DOWN (3,1):**  \nFrom (3,1): next moves: LEFT (2,1), RIGHT (4,1), UP (3,2), DOWN (3,0). All likely free.  \n\n**LEFT (2,2):**  \nFrom (2,2): next moves: UP (2,3), DOWN (2,1), LEFT (1,2), RIGHT (3,2). All likely free.  \n\nAll three safe moves give good mobility next turn.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Enemy movement and collision avoidance  \n\nEnemy head at (4,8). Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP (4,9) \u2014 free.  \n- DOWN (4,7) \u2014 its own body segment, so not allowed.  \n- LEFT (3,8) \u2014 free.  \n- RIGHT (5,8) \u2014 free.  \n\nSo enemy won\u2019t move DOWN.  \n\nEnemy is far from me (distance 6 units in Manhattan terms), so no direct head-on risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Long-term plan  \n\nI have 12 apples, enemy has 6. I\u2019m leading, so survival is key.  \nMy body forms a barrier on right side (x=6\u20138, y=1\u20137).  \nI should avoid getting trapped in the lower-left corner later.  \n\nMoving UP (3,3) keeps me central and allows future path to (1,9) apple by going left and up later.  \nMoving LEFT (2,2) also fine but slightly closer to left edge.  \nMoving DOWN (3,1) is safe but moves away from most apples except the far right ones (9,0\u20132), which are near my tail \u2014 risky to go there with long body.  \n\nBest: UP, because it opens more future options and progresses toward top apples while staying safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (3,3), consider moving toward (1,9) via leftward moves while watching enemy. Keep enemy at distance; use body as barrier. Avoid right side where tail is moving slowly.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

Check each move for immediate death  \n\nFrom (1,3):  \n\n- **UP** \u2192 (1,4)  \n  Check board: At (1,4) in diagram: row 4, col 1 is empty (.) \u2014 safe? Wait, check my body: My body coords: (2,3), (3,3), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). None is (1,4). Enemy body: (5,9),(4,9),(4,8),(4,7),(5,7),(5,6) \u2014 none at (1,4). Enemy head at (5,8) \u2014 not same cell. So not immediate collision. On board? Yes (y=4 within 0-9). Safe for now.  \n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (1,2)  \n  Check: My body has (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), etc. No (1,2). Enemy body none at (1,2). On board? Yes. Safe.  \n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0,3)  \n  On board? Yes (x=0 within 0-9). My body none at (0,3). Enemy body none. Safe.  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,3)  \n  My body: first segment after head is (2,3)! That\u2019s directly adjacent to head currently, moving RIGHT would hit my own body immediately \u2192 death. So **RIGHT** is invalid.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Consider enemy possible moves and head-on collisions  \n\nEnemy head at (5,8). Possible moves: UP\u2192(5,9) but (5,9) is its own body segment \u2192 invalid. DOWN\u2192(5,7) is its own body \u2192 invalid. LEFT\u2192(4,8) is its own body \u2192 invalid. RIGHT\u2192(6,8) empty. So enemy only valid move is RIGHT to (6,8).  \n\nThus enemy will move to (6,8) this turn. No head-on collision possible for me unless I go to (6,8) \u2014 I\u2019m at (1,3), impossible in one move. So no head-on risk.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple targeting and future options  \n\nApples:  \n- (1,9) \u2014 far up, but accessible via left side maybe.  \n- (9,0), (9,1), (9,2) \u2014 far right bottom, blocked by my body in right side.  \n- (9,9) \u2014 far top-right.  \n\nFrom (1,3):  \n  - UP (1,4): moves toward (1,9) vertically, leaves options next turn except maybe right is blocked by body at (2,3)? Actually (2,3) is my neck, but if I move up, neck moves to (1,3), so (2,3) becomes free next turn? Let\u2019s think: after moving UP, body shifts: new head (1,4), neck becomes old head (1,3), rest follow. So (2,3) becomes free. That means from (1,4), possible moves: UP to (1,5), LEFT to (0,4), RIGHT to (2,4) (safe if not body), DOWN back to (1,3) which is now neck \u2014 not safe (backwards into body). So DOWN would be invalid next turn. So UP move now leaves 3 safe moves next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n  - DOWN (1,2): moves away from (1,9), toward bottom apples maybe but far. From (1,2), next moves: DOWN to (1,1), LEFT to (0,2), RIGHT to (2,2) \u2014 all likely safe except check if (2,2) is body? Body has (3,2) but not (2,2). So 3 safe moves next turn too.  \n\n  - LEFT (0,3): moves to left edge, from there next moves: UP (0,4), DOWN (0,2), RIGHT back to (1,3) \u2014 but (1,3) will be neck after move, so RIGHT next turn invalid. So only UP/DOWN safe next turn \u2014 reduces options.  \n\nSo UP and DOWN keep more options than LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Path to apples  \n\nClosest apple in Manhattan distance from (1,3):  \n- (1,9): dist 6  \n- (9,0): dist 11  \n- (9,1): dist 10  \n- (9,2): dist 9  \n- (9,9): dist 14  \n\nUP gets closer to (1,9). DOWN gets closer to bottom apples but they\u2019re farther.  \n\nGiven my body blocks right side, going up left side seems good for reaching (1,9). Enemy is far away (5,8) \u2192 not an immediate threat to me.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Choose move  \n\nBetween UP and DOWN:  \n- UP: closer to apple, keeps 3 options next turn, not near enemy.  \n- DOWN: safe but away from apple.  \n\nLEFT reduces future options.  \n\nSo **UP** is best.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Continue moving upward along left column toward apple (1,9), but watch for enemy movement from right side. Keep multiple escape routes open, avoid boxing self in at top left corner.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

The nearest apples are at (9, 0), (1, 9), (9, 1), (9, 2), and (9, 9).\n3. The enemy snake's head is at (1, 4).\n\nConsidering the four possible directions:\n- UP: This move is possible and would put us at (6, 9), which is on the board and does not immediately provide an apple. However, it would also put us closer to the apple at (1, 9) or (9, 9).\n- DOWN: This move is possible and would put us at (6, 7), which is on the board and does not immediately provide an apple.\n- LEFT: This move is possible and would put us at (5, 8), which is on the board and does not immediately provide an apple. This move would also put us into our own body.\n- RIGHT: This move is possible and would put us at (7, 8), which is on the board and does not immediately provide an apple.\n\nGiven these points, we need to consider moves that keep us alive and potentially move us closer to an apple while avoiding collision with the enemy snake or our own body.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue to maneuver towards the nearest remaining apples, prioritizing moves that keep us safe from collision and position us for potential growth. If the enemy snake moves in a way that creates a safe path to an apple, prioritize eating the apple. Otherwise, focus on avoiding collision and maintaining flexibility for future moves.\n\nSince moving left would result in collision with our own body, we have to choose between up, down, and right.

Check immediate death for each move from (1, 4)\n\n**UP** \u2192 (1, 5):  \n- On board? Yes.  \n- In my body? My body coords: none at (1, 5).  \n- In enemy body? Enemy body coords: none at (1, 5).  \n- Enemy head at (6, 8) \u2260 (1, 5).  \n- Safe for now.  \n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (1, 3):  \n- On board? Yes.  \n- In my body? First body segment after head is (1, 3)! That\u2019s my own body segment directly behind head currently. Moving DOWN would hit myself immediately \u2192 death. Invalid.  \n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (0, 4):  \n- On board? Yes.  \n- In my body? No.  \n- In enemy body? No.  \n- Safe.  \n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 4):  \n- On board? Yes.  \n- In my body? My body coords: none at (2, 4).  \n- In enemy body? No.  \n- Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN kills immediately.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Consider enemy possible moves and head-on collisions\n\nEnemy head at (6, 8): possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 9): empty? Yes (board shows \u2018.\u2019 at (6,9)).  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 7): empty? Yes.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 8): That\u2019s enemy\u2019s own body (first segment after head) \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 8): empty? Yes.  \n\nSo enemy can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.  \n\nCheck if any of my safe moves could cause head-on collision:  \n- UP (1, 5) vs enemy moving to (1, 5)? Enemy can\u2019t reach (1, 5) in 1 move from (6, 8).  \n- LEFT (0, 4): enemy can\u2019t reach.  \n- RIGHT (2, 4): enemy can\u2019t reach.  \nSo no head-on risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Future options after each move\n\nFrom (1, 4):  \n\n**UP to (1, 5)**:  \nNext turn from (1, 5):  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 6): empty now, no body there.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 4): would be old head position, but after moving UP, body shifts: new head (1, 5), neck (1, 4), rest follow. So (1, 4) will be occupied next turn \u2192 DOWN invalid next turn.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 5): empty now, safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 5): empty now, safe.  \n\nSo next turn safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n**LEFT to (0, 4)**:  \nNext turn from (0, 4):  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 5): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 3): empty now, safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 4): will be neck next turn \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT off board \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN (2 options).  \n\n**RIGHT to (2, 4)**:  \nNext turn from (2, 4):  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 5): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 3): That\u2019s my body segment currently at (2, 3), but after moving RIGHT, body shifts: neck becomes (1, 4), (2, 3) stays in body? Let\u2019s trace: current body: (1, 3), (2, 3), \u2026 After move RIGHT: head to (2, 4), new body: old head (1, 4) becomes neck, then (1, 3) becomes next, then (2, 3) becomes next\u2026 So (2, 3) is still in body next turn. So DOWN to (2, 3) invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 4): neck \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 4): empty now, safe.  \n\nSo next turn safe moves: UP, RIGHT (2 options).  \n\nSo UP gives more future options than LEFT or RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Apple targeting\n\nClosest apple in Manhattan distance from (1, 4):  \n- (1, 9): dist 5  \n- (9, 0): dist 12  \n- (9, 1): dist 11  \n- (9, 2): dist 10  \n- (9, 9): dist 13  \n\nUP gets closer to (1, 9).  \nLEFT (0, 4) is neutral for (1, 9) but not closer.  \nRIGHT (2, 4) is slightly away from (1, 9).  \n\nSo UP is best for apple approach.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Long-term plan note\n\nGoal: reach (1, 9) safely. Path: continue UP along left column, but at top near y=9, need to check enemy position. Enemy is far right top currently, might interfere if I go to (1, 9) at same time enemy moves toward it. Keep options open, avoid getting trapped in top-left corner. After reaching y=8 or so, consider moving right toward other apples if enemy blocks (1, 9).  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

This move would also put us into our own body.\n- RIGHT: This move is possible and would put us at (8, 9), which is on the board and does not immediately provide an apple.\n\nGiven these points, we need to consider moves that keep us alive and potentially move us closer to an apple while avoiding collision with the enemy snake or our own body.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue to maneuver towards the nearest remaining apples, prioritizing moves that keep us safe from collision and position us for potential growth. If the enemy snake moves in a way that creates a safe path to an apple, prioritize eating the apple. Otherwise, focus on avoiding collision and maintaining flexibility for future moves.\n\nSince moving left would result in collision with our own body and moving up is not possible, we have to choose between down and right. Moving right seems more promising as it keeps us at the top of the board and allows for more future moves.\n\nRIGHT",

Immediate death \u2192 invalid.\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (0, 6):  \n- On board: yes.  \n- In my body: no.  \n- In enemy body: no.  \nSafe.\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 6):  \n- On board: yes.  \n- In my body: no.  \n- In enemy body: no.  \nSafe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy possible moves and head-on collision risk\n\nEnemy head at (7, 9): possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 10) off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 8) empty (board shows \u2018.\u2019 at (7,8)) \u2192 valid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 9) enemy\u2019s own body (first segment after head) \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 9) empty \u2192 valid.  \n\nEnemy can move DOWN to (7, 8) or RIGHT to (8, 9).  \n\nHead-on collision happens if my next head position equals enemy\u2019s next head position after simultaneous moves.  \nCheck my safe moves vs enemy\u2019s possible moves:\n\nMy UP \u2192 (1, 7). Enemy possible heads: (7, 8) or (8, 9) \u2192 no conflict.  \nMy LEFT \u2192 (0, 6). Enemy possible heads: (7, 8) or (8, 9) \u2192 no conflict.  \nMy RIGHT \u2192 (2, 6). Enemy possible heads: (7, 8) or (8, 9) \u2192 no conflict.  \n\nSo no head-on risk.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Apple targeting\n\nClosest apple from (1, 6):  \n- (1, 9): Manhattan distance = 3  \n- (9, 0): distance = 14  \n- (9, 1): distance = 13  \n- (9, 2): distance = 12  \n- (9, 9): distance = 13  \n\nUP gets closer to (1, 9).  \nRIGHT moves away from (1, 9) but slightly closer to right-side apples (still far).  \nLEFT moves away from (1, 9) and reduces future options.\n\nUP is best for approaching (1, 9).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Long-term plan note\n\nEnemy at (7, 9) can move DOWN to (7, 8) or RIGHT to (8, 9) this turn. They are far away from (1, 9). Continue moving UP along x=1 to grab (1, 9) soon. After eating (1, 9), I\u2019ll be longer and can consider moving right along top row toward (9, 9) or going down right column for other apples. Avoid trapping myself in top-left corner \u2014 keep escape routes open. Enemy is still small (length 7) and far, so minimal immediate threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Check possible moves from (1, 9)\n\n- **UP**: (1, 10) \u2192 off board \u2192 **invalid**\n- **DOWN**: (1, 8) \u2192 occupied by my own body \u2192 **invalid**\n- **LEFT**: (0, 9) \u2192 empty on board (checked board state: row 9, col 0 is '.'), not in any snake body \u2192 **valid**\n- **RIGHT**: (2, 9) \u2192 empty on board (row 9, col 2 is '.'), not in any snake body \u2192 **valid**\n\nSo safe moves: **LEFT**, **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Consider enemy\u2019s possible moves from (9, 8)\n\nEnemy body: (9, 9) above, (8, 9) left of that, etc. From (9, 8):\n\n- UP: (9, 9) \u2192 own body \u2192 invalid  \n- DOWN: (9, 7) \u2192 empty? Board shows row 7 col 9 '.' \u2192 valid  \n- LEFT: (8, 8) \u2192 empty? Board shows row 8 col 8 '.' \u2192 valid  \n- RIGHT: (10, 8) \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid  \n\nSo enemy can move DOWN or LEFT.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Avoid head-on collisions\n\nMy possible moves: LEFT \u2192 (0, 9), RIGHT \u2192 (2, 9).  \nEnemy possible moves: DOWN \u2192 (9, 7), LEFT \u2192 (8, 8).  \nNo overlap possible this turn \u2192 no head-on collision risk.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility & apples\n\nApples:  \n- (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2) \u2014 far away  \n- (5, 5) \u2014 closer but blocked by my own body currently  \n- (7, 8) \u2014 closer to enemy than me  \n\nFrom (1, 9):  \n- LEFT (0, 9): next moves from there: UP off board, DOWN (0, 8) empty, RIGHT (1, 9) back to current head (occupied next turn by my old head\u2019s position? Wait, my body moves forward, so (1, 9) will be empty next turn? Actually my head moves to (0, 9), my tail (6, 1) moves forward? No, growth only if eat apple. I didn\u2019t eat apple last turn, so my tail moves: my tail is (6, 1), will move to (6, 2)?? Let\u2019s check: body list: head (1, 9), then (1, 8)\u2026 last (6, 1) is tail. If I move without eating, tail segment (6, 1) disappears, new tail becomes (6, 2). So (1, 9) becomes empty? No, my new head at (0, 9), old head at (1, 9) becomes body segment, so (1, 9) occupied by my body next turn. So from (0, 9) next turn: DOWN (0, 8) free, RIGHT (1, 9) my body \u2192 invalid, UP off board, LEFT off board \u2192 only 1 safe move next turn (DOWN). That\u2019s risky.\n\n- RIGHT (2, 9): from (2, 9) next turn: UP off board, DOWN (2, 8) empty, LEFT (1, 9) my body, RIGHT (3, 9) empty \u2192 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT). Better mobility.\n\nRIGHT seems better for keeping options open.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Long-term plan note\n\nI\u2019m long (length 14) and curled in the left side. Need to loop around to eat apples safely without trapping myself. Apple at (5, 5) is blocked by my own body currently \u2014 need to navigate around. Possibly go right across top, then down right side, avoid enemy near (7, 8). Enemy is shorter (length 8), may go for apple (7, 8) or (9, 2). Keep distance, maintain mobility.\n\n---\n\n**Final move choice:**  \nRIGHT",

Head-on collision risk\n\nMy possible moves: (2, 8) DOWN, (3, 9) RIGHT.  \nEnemy possible moves: (8, 7) DOWN, (7, 8) LEFT.\n\nNo overlap between { (2, 8), (3, 9) } and { (8, 7), (7, 8) } \u2192 no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility & apple access\n\nFrom (2, 9):\n\n- **RIGHT to (3, 9)**:  \nNext turn possible moves from (3, 9):  \nUP off board, DOWN (3, 8) empty, LEFT (2, 9) my body, RIGHT (4, 9) empty.  \nSo 2 safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.  \nApple (5, 5) is reachable eventually but blocked by my own body currently. Apple (7, 8) is near enemy, risky. Apples at (9,0-2) far.\n\n- **DOWN to (2, 8)**:  \nNext turn from (2, 8):  \nUP (2, 9) my body \u2192 invalid, DOWN (2, 7) empty, LEFT (1, 8) my body, RIGHT (3, 8) empty.  \nSo 2 safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nMobility-wise similar. But DOWN moves me away from the top edge, opens more future options toward center/left side.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Enemy\u2019s likely move\n\nApple at (7, 8) is right next to enemy\u2019s possible move LEFT to (7, 8). If enemy moves LEFT, it eats apple and grows by 1. That would put enemy head at (7, 8), body extends behind. Might block my path toward right side later.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 9), I stay near top edge, far from enemy. If I move DOWN to (2, 8), I go toward middle, closer to my own body loop but also closer to apple (5, 5) eventually.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Long-term plan\n\nMy snake body occupies left side (x=1) from y=3 to y=9, plus a horizontal segment at y=3 from x=1 to x=3, then down to (3,2) and across to (6,2). I need to avoid trapping myself. Moving DOWN from (2, 9) to (2, 8) keeps me near my own body line but there\u2019s space to go down then right later. Moving RIGHT to (3, 9) then maybe down later could loop around top-right.\n\nSince enemy might eat apple at (7, 8) and grow, I should maybe steer clear of that area for now. Apple (5, 5) is closer to my current position if I go down then right through (3, 8) \u2192 (4, 8) etc., but need to avoid colliding with my body at (1, 7), (1, 6), etc. Actually my body blocks direct path to (5, 5) from (2, 8) unless I go around.\n\nGiven that, maybe RIGHT is safer short-term because it moves me away from my own dense body region and avoids potential enemy conflict if enemy goes for (7, 8).\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove RIGHT to (3, 9), then next turn likely DOWN to (3, 8) to start descending right side, aiming to circle around toward apple (5, 5) from the east, avoiding enemy near (7, 8).\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy snake's head is at (3, 9).\n\nConsidering the four possible directions:\n- UP: This move is possible and would put us at (7, 9), which is on the board but directly into our own body, so it's not allowed.\n- DOWN: This move is possible and would put us at (7, 7), which is on the board and does not immediately provide an apple.\n- LEFT: This move is possible and would put us at (6, 8), which is on the board and does not immediately provide an apple.\n- RIGHT: This move is possible and would put us at (8, 8), which is on the board and does not immediately provide an apple, but it moves us closer to the apple at (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2) in the long run.\n\nGiven these points, we need to consider moves that keep us alive and potentially move us closer to an apple while avoiding collision with the enemy snake or our own body.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue to maneuver towards the nearest remaining apples, prioritizing moves that keep us safe from collision and position us for potential growth. The apples at (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2) seem like good targets for now, as they are closer than (0, 7) and moving towards them doesn't immediately put us in danger.\n\nSince moving right allows us to move towards the apples at (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2) without immediately hitting our own body or the enemy snake, this seems like the best immediate move.\n\nRIGHT",
