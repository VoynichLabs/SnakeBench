No snake heads or bodies are there.\n- **DOWN to (1, 2):** Safe. No snake heads or bodies are there.\n- **LEFT to (0, 3):** Safe. No snake heads or bodies are there.\n- **RIGHT to (2, 3):** Safe. No snake heads or bodies are there.\n\nAll four moves are immediately safe. Therefore, the decision will be based on strategic value.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Strategic Value of Moves\n\n#### Objective:\n\n1. Increase chance of safely eating apples.\n2. Keep future options open.\n\n#### Apple Proximity & Path Analysis\n\n- **Closest Apples:**\n  - (2, 6) is relatively close. Moving RIGHT opens a direct path up the board.\n  - (4, 5) and (7, 5) are further but on the same row, could be considered later.\n  - The top apples like (3, 9) and (4, 8) are distant; heading RIGHT first provides better long-term access.\n\n#### Current Enemy Position and Potential Threats\n\n- Enemy head is at (3, 2). It is two spaces to the right and one space down from my head.\n- If I move RIGHT to (2, 3), the enemy could potentially move to (2, 2) and get close, but it's not an immediate threat.\n- The enemy snake poses a strategic concern, but for Turn 0, the safest approach is to move away and consolidate position.\n\n#### Analyzing Directions:\n\n- **UP:** Moves me towards apples at (2, 6) and others above. However, it moves me further away from several apple-rich areas on the right side of the board. It's a valid option.\n- **DOWN:** Moves me towards the bottom of the board where fewer apples are. It keeps me away from the enemy snake, which is currently below and to the right of me. Less favorable for immediate apple collection.\n- **LEFT:** Moves me to the edge of the board (x=0). This severely limits future horizontal movement options and doesn't bring me closer to any apples. It's the least strategic option.\n- **RIGHT:** Moves me towards the center of the board. This is near the cluster of apples at (4, 5) and (7, 5). It also puts more distance between me and the enemy snake, while keeping my options open to move up or down in future turns. It provides the most flexibility and pathing towards apples.\n\n---\n\n### Plan for Next Few Turns\n\nMy initial strategy is to move RIGHT to get into a central x-column, then move UP to approach the apples at (2, 6) and (4, 5). I also want to avoid getting cornered by the enemy snake, so moving to the right half of the board is advantageous.\n\nRIGHT",

This is a death move.\n- The last move was LEFT, likely chosen randomly due to a rate limit error. This indicates I should not repeat that move without verification.\n\n**Valid Move Options from (0, 3):**\n1. **RIGHT** to (1, 3)\n2. **UP** to (0, 4)\n3. **DOWN** to (0, 2)\n\n**Evaluating Moves:**\n\n1. **RIGHT to (1, 3):**\n   - Safe: Yes, on board, no snake conflict.\n   - Strategy: Moves me away from the left wall, towards the center of the board where apples are.\n   - Future Moves: From (1, 3), I can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT next turn.\n   - Proximity to Apples: Gets me closer to apples at (2, 6) and (4, 5) potentially, but not immediately closer to any.\n\n2. **UP to (0, 4):**\n   - Safe: Yes, on board, no snake conflict.\n   - Strategy: Moves me up, closer to apples at (3, 9), (2, 6), (4, 8).\n   - Future Moves: From (0, 4), I can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn.\n   - Proximity to Apples: This seems like a good general direction.\n\n3. **DOWN to (0, 2):**\n   - Safe: Yes, on board, no snake conflict.\n   - Strategy: Moves me towards the bottom. Fewer apples are in that direction.\n   - Future Moves: From (0, 2), I can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn.\n   - Proximity to Apples: Not ideal, as it takes me away from most apples.\n\n**Comparing UP vs RIGHT:**\nBoth are safe and open up good future options. UP seems slightly better because it moves me towards the cluster of apples in the upper part of the board (rows 6-9).\n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 0) at (4, 4):**\nIts possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. It's far enough that it's not an immediate threat, but its direction could become relevant.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that UP is safe, moves me towards apples, and keeps future options open, it's the preferred move.\n\n### Short-Term Plan\nHead UP to get into a better vertical position for reaching apples in the upper half of the board. Avoid the left edge which is a death zone. Re-evaluate next turn based on enemy movement.\n\nUP",
