LEFT (2,4) into body \u2014 not safe. Also 3 safe moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy movement consideration:**  \nEnemy at (5,8) length 1. It might go for apples (9,6) or (9,9) possibly. It\u2019s far from (0,4). So moving toward (0,4) seems safe from immediate competition.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \n- UP moves away from closest apple.  \n- LEFT moves toward apple (0,4) and still keeps options open.  \n- RIGHT moves away from closest apple but toward board center.  \n\nGiven the objective to eat apples safely, LEFT seems optimal: gets me closer to (0,4) with no risk this turn, and next turn I can eat it if I choose.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go LEFT to (1,4), next turn I can go LEFT to (0,4) to eat apple, but check safety then: enemy may move unpredictably, but unlikely to reach (0,4) in two moves from (5,8). Keep avoiding moving into own body.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Wait: body order: head at (1, 5), then (1, 4), then (2, 4). So (1, 4) is body segment next turn, so DOWN not safe. LEFT (0, 5), RIGHT (2, 5) are safe. So safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).

After eating, even with only 2 moves next turn, I can likely survive if I choose wisely then.  \n\nGiven the rules, I should favor moves toward apples if safe.  \n\nLEFT is safe now and gets an apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go LEFT and eat apple at (0, 4), next turn I must choose UP or DOWN carefully, avoiding moving into my own body (1, 4).

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:  \n\n**My snake (ID 0):**  \n- Head: (5, 5)  \n- Body: [(4, 5), (3, 5)]  \n- Length: 3  \n- Apples collected: 2  \n\n**Apples:** (7, 5), (7, 0), (9, 6), (9, 9), (7, 9)  \n\n**Enemy snake (ID 1):**  \n- Head: (8, 9)  \n- Body: none  \n- Length: 1  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Possible moves from (5, 5):  \n\n**UP \u2192 (5, 6)**  \n- Within board.  \n- Not my body (body at (4,5), (3,5)).  \n- Not enemy body (enemy has no body).  \n- Safe.  \n\n**DOWN \u2192 (5, 4)**  \n- Within board.  \n- Not my body.  \n- Safe.  \n\n**LEFT \u2192 (4, 5)**  \n- That's my own body (neck). \u2192 Death. Eliminate.  \n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (6, 5)**  \n- Within board.  \n- Not my body.  \n- Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy movement prediction:  \nEnemy head at (8, 9). Possible enemy moves: UP (8,10) off board \u2192 death, so not likely. DOWN (8, 8), LEFT (7, 9), RIGHT (9, 9).  \nApples at (7, 9) and (9, 9) are adjacent to enemy.  \nEnemy will likely move to an apple if possible.  \nFrom (8, 9):  \n- LEFT to (7, 9) \u2192 apple there \u2192 grows to length 2.  \n- RIGHT to (9, 9) \u2192 apple there \u2192 grows to length 2.  \n- DOWN to (8, 8) \u2192 safe but no apple.  \n\nEnemy will probably go LEFT or RIGHT to eat apple.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (7, 9), new body segment at (8, 9).  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (9, 9), new body segment at (8, 9).  \n\nEither way, enemy will be at an apple cell after moving, growing next turn.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple proximity for me:  \nClosest apple: (7, 5) at distance |7-5| + |5-5| = 2.  \n\nFrom (5, 5):  \n- UP (5, 6): distance to (7, 5) = |2| + |1| = 3  \n- DOWN (5, 4): distance to (7, 5) = |2| + |1| = 3  \n- RIGHT (6, 5): distance to (7, 5) = 1  \n\nRIGHT reduces distance most.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Collision risk this turn:  \nEnemy at (8, 9) \u2192 can't reach my possible head positions (5,6), (5,4), (6,5) in one move. No head-on risk.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Future mobility after each safe move:  \n\n**If RIGHT to (6, 5):**  \nBody becomes [(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]  \nNext turn moves from (6,5): UP (6,6), DOWN (6,4), LEFT (5,5) body, RIGHT (7,5) apple \u2192 eating apple possible.  \nIf eat apple at (7,5) next turn, will grow to length 4, tail stays same.  \n\n**If UP to (5, 6):**  \nBody: [(5,6), (5,5), (4,5)]  \nNext moves from (5,6): UP (5,7), DOWN (5,5) body, LEFT (4,6), RIGHT (6,6) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n**If DOWN to (5, 4):**  \nBody: [(5,4), (5,5), (4,5)]  \nNext moves from (5,4): UP (5,5) body, DOWN (5,3), LEFT (4,4), RIGHT (6,4) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nAll keep 3 safe moves next turn except RIGHT gives option to eat apple immediately next turn if we choose.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Long-term considerations:  \nEnemy will grow to length 2 after this turn. Still far away.  \nRight now, getting apples faster is good. Moving RIGHT gets us closer to (7,5) and sets up eating next turn if we go RIGHT again then. Need to check if (7,5) is safe next turn: enemy won\u2019t be there (at (7,9) or (9,9) after eating).  \n\nAlso, after eating at (7,5), we\u2019ll be length 4, body: [(7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5)] \u2014 still mobile.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf we go RIGHT now to (6,5), next turn we can go RIGHT to (7,5) to eat apple unless enemy somehow threatens. Enemy will be far at (7,9) or (9,9) with length 2, so safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** RIGHT gets us closer to apple, safe, good mobility, no collision risk.  \n\nRIGHT",
