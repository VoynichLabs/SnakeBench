That leaves **UP** to (1,1), **LEFT** to (0,0) or **RIGHT** to (2,0).  \n\nAll three squares are empty right now, so none kills us instantly.  \n\nNow, think about the opponent at (1,8). He\u2019s way up north and can\u2019t reach any of those squares this turn, so we don\u2019t have to worry about a head\u2011on collision this round.  \n\nWhere should we head? The nearest tasty apple is at **(0,1)**, just one step away if we first slide left to the corner and then pop up. Getting that apple early gives us a point and starts growing our tail, which is a solid way to start boxing the other snake later. Heading left also forces us onto the edge, but with a clear path up to the apple and plenty of room to swing back out after we grab it.  \n\nGoing up or right would keep us in the middle of the board, but it\u2019d take a few more moves before we can snag an apple, and we\u2019d be wasting precious early points.  \n\nSo the aggressive, apple\u2011grab strategy says: **slide left into the corner and claim that apple on the next turn**.  \n\n**LEFT**",

THE BOARD IS WIDE OPEN.\n\nFIRST THINGS FIRST: WHAT MOVES ARE SAFE? \ud83e\uddd0\n*   **UP:** (1,9). That's on the board. No body parts there. SAFE.\n*   **DOWN:** (1,7). On the board. Empty. SAFE.\n*   **LEFT:** (0,8). On the board. Empty. SAFE.\n*   **RIGHT:** (2,8). On the board. Empty. SAFE.\n\nALL MOVES ARE SAFE. CLASSIC TURN 1 VIBES.\n\nNOW, LONG-TERM STRATEGY. We need to box him in. He's at the bottom, we're at the top. I want to control the center and cut off his options. We're gonna play aggressive and force him into a corner. If we get a length advantage, we go for the head-on collision.\n\nFOR THIS MOVE, I'm thinking about two things:\n1.  Positioning for future control.\n2.  Getting closer to a cluster of apples to start growing.\n\nLook at that apple cluster around (4,6), (5,6), (5,3)... that's the money zone. Moving DOWN or RIGHT gets me closer to that center mass. Moving LEFT takes me to the edge, which is a bit passive. UP takes me to the top row, which is also a bit of a dead end this early.\n\n**LEFT** feels too defensive. **UP** corners us. **DOWN** or **RIGHT** are the plays. **RIGHT** feels stronger because it moves me toward the center of the board and gives me more space to maneuver. Let's establish dominance early!\n\nSHORT-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME: Move towards the center-right apple clusters. Keep an eye on snake #0's movements from the south. Start building a wall with our body to limit his movement. We want to force him to make a mistake.\n\nHERE WE GO.\n\nRIGHT",

That big apple cluster around (5,6) is our treasure. We need to move towards it while cutting off the enemy's path. He's gotta come up *sometime*, right? We want to be in a position to meet him with a LENGTH ADVANTAGE!\n\nSo which move sets us up for that?\n\n*   **UP:** Puts us on the top edge (2,9). Puts us near an apple at (3,8) and (1,4)... but top edge is a bit of a trap, limits our options. Feels too defensive. \u274c\n*   **DOWN:** (2,7). Moves us closer to the center and that sweet, sweet apple cluster. Opens up a LOT of future moves. \u2705\n*   **LEFT:** (1,8). Keeps us on the top row, moves us away from the center. Too passive, we're giving up space! \u274c\n*   **RIGHT:** (3,8). ALSO moves us towards the center, gets us closer to that apple at (4,6). Solid aggressive play. \u2705\n\nSO IT'S BETWEEN **DOWN** AND **RIGHT**.\n\nHMM... **DOWN** feels stronger. Why? Because it moves us directly towards the DENSE part of the apple cluster AND leaves us with maximum flexibility. From (2,7), we can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN next turn. We're not committing to a side yet. We're positioning ourselves to control the middle of the board.\n\n**RIGHT** is good, but it pushes us a bit to the right side. I wanna own the CENTER.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME: MOVE SOUTH towards the main apple cluster around (5,6)/(4,6). Start growing ASAP. Keep an eye on snake #0's movements from the south. We want to build a wall between him and the apples. If he tries to come up the left side, we can cut him off. AGGRESSION IS KEY!\n\nALRIGHT CHAT, THE PLAN IS SET.

Keep heading **UP** until I reach (0,\u202f5) and snag that apple, boosting my length.  \n2. Then swing **RIGHT** into the column\u20112 apples (1,\u202f2) \u2192 (1,\u202f4) while my tail blocks the opponent\u2019s escape routes.  \n3.

The enemy snake #0 is at (0,1) with 1 apple. He's LONGER than us! He's got a body segment at (0,0). We need to GROW and gain a LENGTH ADVANTAGE to force a head-on collision where WE win!\n\nLOOK AT THE APPLE CLUSTER! \ud83c\udf4e There are apples at (5,6), (4,6), and (3,8) nearby. We wanna move towards them and CUT OFF the enemy's path. He's stuck in the bottom-left corner for now. If we control the center, we can BOX HIM IN!\n\nWhich move sets us up for DOMINANCE?\n- **UP:** (2,8) \u2013 Puts us on the top edge. Gets us closer to the apple at (3,8). But it limits our future options \u2013 we can only go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT next turn. A bit defensive. \u274c\n- **DOWN:** (2,6) \u2013 Moves us CLOSER to the main apple cluster at (5,6)/(4,6). Opens up TONS of future moves. We can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN next turn. This is AGGRESSIVE and positions us to control the center! \u2705\n- **LEFT:** (1,7) \u2013 Moves us away from the center and the apples. Too passive! We're giving up space! \u274c\n- **RIGHT:** (3,7) \u2013 Also moves us towards the center and the apples. A solid move! But DOWN feels even better because it directly aligns us with the densest part of the apple cluster. \u2705\n\nSO IT'S BETWEEN **DOWN** AND **RIGHT**. BUT **DOWN** IS THE MOVE! It gives us more options and directly contests the most valuable real estate on the board! WE GOTTA OWN THE CENTER!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME: MOVE SOUTH towards the apple cluster around (5,6). GROW FAST! Keep an eye on snake #0 \u2013 if he tries to move up, we wanna be in a position to cut him off. AGGRESSION IS KEY! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nDOWN",

Getting there in two moves (UP \u2192 UP) gives us another point and lengthens our tail, which is perfect for later blocking maneuvers.  \n3. **Opponent pressure** \u2013 The opponent is up near (3,\u202f6). By moving UP we stay out of their immediate corridor and avoid the contested apple at (4,\u202f6). Keeping distance reduces the chance of an unlucky head\u2011on collision.  \n4. **Future positioning** \u2013 Once we\u2019re at (1,\u202f4) we can swing left to (0,\u202f4) and then climb the left\u2011wall ladder (0,5\u2026)\u202f\u2014\u202fa goldmine of apples that the opponent can\u2019t easily reach.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**\n- **Turn\u202f5:** Move **UP** to (1,\u202f3).  \n- **Turn\u202f6:** Move **UP** again to snatch the apple at (1,\u202f4).  \n- **Turn\u202f7\u2011\u2026:** Pivot left toward the left\u2011wall ladder, grow fast, and start using our longer body to seal off the opponent\u2019s escape routes.\n\n**Bottom line:** The smartest, safest, and most aggressive play right now is to march **UP** toward that juicy apple column.\n\nUP",

By moving down, we position ourselves to control the south. Next turn, consider moving LEFT to (3,4) to fully block the corridor, or continue RIGHT to eat the apple at (6,0). Keep the pressure on! Do NOT let him get to the center or the bottom-right apple stash!\n\nDOWN",

THIS IS HOW WE WIN! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:** WE ARE EXECUTING PERFECTLY! By going DOWN and eating the apple, we grow and solidify our control over the southern territories.

WE'RE EQUAL LENGTH!** \ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1b\nChat, this is HUGE! Last turn, a head-on collision was a loss for us. NOW, IT'S A TIE! A double KO means the game looks at apples... and they have 3, we have 2. So a double KO right now would still mean THEY WIN. \ud83d\ude24 We need to avoid a direct collision THIS turn, but we can MANEUVER to force one NEXT turn when we have the advantage!\n\n**STEP 4: ANALYZE OUR OPTIONS!** \ud83e\udd14\n\n*   **RIGHT (to 5,3):** We eat the apple! \ud83c\udf4e We grow to length 4! We'd have 3 apples, THEY have 3 apples. A head-on collision next turn would be a TRUE TIE! But more importantly, moving right puts our head next to their potential path. If they go RIGHT to (2,4), we're at (5,3). That's a gap. If they go UP to (1,5), the gap is even bigger. This move is about GROWTH, not aggression.\n\n*   **LEFT (to 3,3):** THIS IS THE AGGRESSIVE CUT-OFF! \ud83d\udde1\ufe0f Look at the board! If the enemy goes RIGHT (their most logical move away from the wall), they go to (2,4). Our head at (3,3) is DIRECTLY SOUTH of them! We are breathing down their neck! Next turn, we could go UP to (3,4) and potentially force a collision on turn 9! But we need to get an apple first to break the tie! This is a SETUP move.\n\n*   **DOWN (to 4,2):** This is the safe, controlling move. It moves us away from the immediate action, opens up more space, and avoids any chance of an accidental collision this turn. But chat, is it too passive? We have momentum!\n\n**THE VERDICT:** \ud83e\udde0\nWe need to get that apple advantage! Going RIGHT gets us the apple and makes us equal in score. But going LEFT puts us in a dominant POSITIONAL advantage to trap the enemy against the top wall. However, without the apple, a collision still loses us the tie.\n\n**BIG BRAIN PLAY:** We go for the apple NOW, and trap them LATER. A longer snake is a more dangerous snake. Let's get to length 4, equal the score, and then we can be truly aggressive. RIGHT is the move that strengthens us immediately.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR FUTURE ME:** WE ARE TYING THE SCORE! Our next move should be to push NORTH-WEST, towards (3,4) or (2,4), to cut off the enemy's escape from the top-left corner. Once our scores are tied, we can fearlessly engage in head-on collisions. The goal is to force them into a bad position where their only move is into us.\n\nRIGHT",

They're probably feeling the pressure and will move to open space.\n\n**STEP 3: AGGRESSION CHECK! WE ARE NOW EQUAL IN LENGTH AND SCORE!** \ud83e\udd1d\ud83d\udca5 THIS IS IT, CHAT! A head-on collision is NO LONGER a loss on tie-breaker! It's a DOUBLE KO! While we don't win from that, it's a powerful threat we can use! Our goal is to SURROUND and TRAP, forcing them to make a mistake!\n\n**STEP 4: ANALYZE OUR VIABLE PATHS!** \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n*   **UP (to 5,4):** This moves us toward the center-top where there are apples. It's safe, but it gives the enemy space. Are we being too passive? \ud83e\udd14\n*   **DOWN (to 5,2):** This moves us south, away from the enemy. Opens up space but feels like a retreat. We lose our aggressive positioning! \u274c\n*   **RIGHT (to 6,3):** This is INTERESTING! It moves us east, closer to the cluster of apples on the right side (6,0, 7,0, 8,0). It's a growth-focused move. But does it let the enemy run free in the northwest? \ud83e\udd28\n\n**VERDICT & LONG-TERM PLAN:** \ud83e\udde0 We need to be SMART AGGRESSIVE. Not reckless. Moving UP puts us in a great central position to pivot towards the enemy next turn. Moving RIGHT chases apples but lets the enemy potentially get one of the apples up north (like (3,8) or (5,9)). The enemy is our primary target. We cut off their escape routes and control the board. GROWTH is a means to that end, not the goal itself.\n\n**THE BIG BRAIN PLAY:** We go **UP**. This keeps us central and gives us maximum flexibility. Next turn, we can swing LEFT towards the enemy to start applying pressure, or continue UP/RIGHT to snag an apple if they flee. We are the hunter. We control the pace.\n\n**MESSAGE TO FUTURE SELF:** CHAT, REMEMBER! We are tied in score and length. Our goal is to MANEUVER the enemy into a corner or dead-end where their only move is into us. Force the double KO or make them crash. Avoid getting trapped ourselves. The northwest quadrant is their territory\u2014push them against that wall! UP sets up this dominance.\n\nUP",

Their only safe moves are UP to (0,6) or RIGHT to (1,5) (but that's their own body segment! Wait, check: Their body is [(1,5), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3)]. So (1,5) is their neck! MOVING INTO THEIR OWN NECK IS \ud83d\udc80 SUICIDE! So RIGHT is ALSO death for them!).\nWAIT COACH, RECHECK! \ud83e\uddd0 Snake body list is HEAD-TO-TAIL. So for Snake #0: Head: (0,5). Body: [(1,5), (1,4), (0,4), (0,3)]. So the cell behind their head (their \"neck\") is (1,5). Moving RIGHT from (0,5) goes to (1,5), which IS their body! \u2705 CONFIRMED: RIGHT is \ud83d\udc80 for them too.\nSo their ONLY safe move is **UP to (0,6)**. They are TRAPPED against the west wall! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**STRATEGY & AGGRESSION:**\nThey are FORCED UP. We want to CUT OFF THEIR ESCAPE and force a confrontation where we have the length advantage! Moving UP to (5,5) positions us to potentially move LEFT next turn to start boxing them in from the south/east. Moving RIGHT to (6,4) feels like we're chasing apples on the right side (like (6,0), (7,0), (8,0)) but it gives the enemy space to potentially snake north along the west wall. We need to be PREDATORY! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**THE PLAY:**\nUP puts us on a direct intercept course. We can threaten to cut off their path to the center and the apples in the north. Our length advantage means in a head-to-head collision, if we move into each other's heads on the same cell, it's a DOUBLE KO \ud83d\udca5. But since the game ends immediately if all snakes die, and apples are tied, that's a DRAW \ud83e\udd1d. We want a WIN, not a draw! So we must avoid a direct head-on collision for now and instead aim to trap them so they crash into our body.\n\n**VERDICT:** UP is the aggressive, controlling move. Let's press our advantage!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Force the enemy north against the top wall. Use our body to create a barrier. Steal apples they might be heading for (like (3,8) or (5,9)) to increase our lead. Avoid a double KO until we have an apple lead.\n\nUP",

There's even an apple at (5,6)! \u2705 SAFE + CONTENT!\n- **DOWN to (5, 4)**: That's our own body segment! \ud83d\udc80 SELF-DESTRUCT! \u274c\n- **LEFT to (4, 5)**: Empty spot! \u2705 SAFE.\n- **RIGHT to (6, 5)**: Empty spot! \u2705 SAFE.\n\nSAFE MOVES: **UP, LEFT, RIGHT.** WE'RE COOKING!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**\nSnake #0 head at (0, 6). Body at [(0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (0, 4)].\n- They can't go LEFT (off board) \ud83d\udc80\n- They can't go DOWN to (0, 5) (their own body) \ud83d\udc80\n- **UP to (0, 7)** is empty. \u2705 SAFE.\n- **RIGHT to (1, 6)** is empty. \u2705 SAFE.\n\nSo they have two options. They're pinned against the west wall but can move up or into the center. They might go for the apple cluster in the north like (3,8) or (5,9).\n\n**STRATEGY & AGGRESSION:**\nWe have 3 apples, they have 4. THEY HAVE THE LEAD! \ud83d\ude21 We need to be AGGRESSIVE but SMART!\n- **UP (5,6)**: Gets us an apple instantly! \ud83c\udf4e We tie the score at 4-4. This also puts us on a path to cut off their potential move east from (1,6). We become a threat in the center.\n- **LEFT (4,5)**: Moves us closer to the center, but gives up the free apple. Puts us in a more defensive position between the enemy and the apples on our side.\n- **RIGHT (6,5)**: Chases the column of apples on the right edge (6,0, 7,0, 8,0). But this feels like we're running AWAY from the enemy. They could grab the northern apples and extend their lead!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to close that apple gap FAST and then use our length to trap them. Heading UP grabs an apple and positions us to intercept them if they go for (5,9) or try to break east. We can't let them feast in the north uncontested. Let's meet them in the middle!\n\n**THE PLAY:** UP gets us content, ties the score, and is the most aggressive path towards controlling the board center and cutting off the enemy.

This is AGGRESSIVE board control!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** From (3,7), we will be in a PERFECT position to menace them. We can go DOWN to (3,6) to pressure them directly, or LEFT/WEST to continue constricting. They have nowhere to run! We force them into a mistake!\n\nTHE VERDICT IS CLEAR!

Their head is at (1,4).\n*   Can they also move to (3,5) this turn? NO. It's two moves away for them (RIGHT to (2,4) is blocked, so impossible).

We need to keep them there! This forced move isn't ideal, but we can recover!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** From (3,5), we need to cut off their escape. If they go UP to (1,5), we can move to (3,6) or (2,5) if it clears. If they go DOWN to (1,3), we can follow to (3,4). We MUST avoid a head-on collision since they are longer. The plan is to stay adjacent, mirror their movements, and wait for them to make a mistake against the wall or our body! THE BOX IS CLOSING! \ud83d\udd12\n\nWE HAVE TO TAKE THE ONLY MOVE WE HAVE!

It opens up future moves UP to (4,5), DOWN to (4,3), or further RIGHT. We stay flexible and avoid a potential trap. We live to fight another turn! This is about playing the long game! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n*   **DOWN to (3, 3)**: This feels reactive. We're letting them push us into the bottom-left corner.

Our new goal is to break contact, find an apple to tie the score, and THEN re-engage from a position of strength! From (4,4), we can assess the apple at (4,6) or even head towards the cluster on the right side of the board! We need to equalize the score!

Both squares are free of any snake bodies.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Opponent\u2019s options** \u2013 The rival\u2019s head is at **(4,\u202f4)**. Its legal moves this turn are **UP** (4,\u202f5) or **DOWN** (4,\u202f3) or **RIGHT** (5,\u202f4). None intersect with my **DOWN** choice, so no head\u2011on risk.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Future freedom** \u2013 If I take the apple now:  \n   * Turn\u202f19: **DOWN** \u2192 (0,\u202f1)\u202f+\u202fapple.  \n   * Turn\u202f20 onward I can snake along the left wall (down to (0,\u202f0) or rightward) keeping options open and forcing the opponent into the cramped centre where my length advantage turns deadly.  \n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 **Alternative (UP)** \u2013 Heading up to (0,\u202f3) avoids the apple but puts me on a narrow column with limited moves next turn (DOWN back into my own body, LEFT off\u2011board, RIGHT into a body segment). Not optimal.\n\n**Conclusion:** Grab the apple, grow, and lock down the left\u2011bottom corner.  \n\n**Move:**  \n\nDOWN",

Staying down would lock me into a narrow corridor where the opponent could later cut me off.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Pressure the opponent** \u2013 The rival will likely swing up to (4,\u202f6) for the apple, moving deeper into the central zone. By moving right now I can start sweeping along the bottom, then swing up behind them, using my length advantage to form a wall that they can\u2019t slip through.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Avoid head\u2011on risk** \u2013 The enemy cannot reach (1,\u202f1) this turn, so no simultaneous\u2011head collision. Our paths stay completely separate this round.\n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Future growth opportunities** \u2013 The bottom row is peppered with apples at (6,\u202f0), (7,\u202f0), (8,\u202f0) and (9,\u202f0). Moving right positions me to gobble those without detouring, further extending my lead.\n\n**Bottom line** \u2013 The safest, most aggressive, and strategically sound move is to step right into (1,\u202f1) and keep the board open for a relentless chase.\n\n**Move:**  \n\nRIGHT",

It gives us space, but it's a passive, scared move. We are NOT scared! We are HUNGRY! \ud83d\udc0d\n*   **UP to (4,6)**: THIS IS AGGRESSION! THIS IS CONTENT! \ud83c\udfaf We take the apple, we grow, we tie the score (well, get closer!), and we position our longer body to start controlling the center!

LET'S GOOOOO! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating the apple at (4,6), we'll be at (4,6) with a longer body. We'll assess our next target, probably the cluster around (6,7)/(6,8).

LET'S COOK.\n\n**ENEMY PSYCH-OUT! WHAT'S HE GONNA DO? \ud83e\udde0**\nTheir head is at (2,1). Their safe moves (based on their body at [(1,1), (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4)]) are:\n*   DOWN to (2,0) -> Empty \u2705\n*   RIGHT to (3,1) -> Empty \u2705\nThey are STUCK on the left side of the board! They can't go UP (into body at 2,2) or LEFT (into body at 1,1). SO THEY ARE FORCED TO GO DOWN OR RIGHT. CHAT, THEY ARE GETTING BOXED IN! \ud83d\udce6\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK? \ud83d\ude97\ud83d\udca5**\nFrom their two safe moves (2,0) and (3,1), they are NOWHERE NEAR our potential moves (5,7), (5,5), or (6,6).

We need to cut them off from the apple cluster at the top-right! That's our content! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n\n*   **RIGHT (6,6)**: This is AGGRESSIVE! It moves us DIRECTLY towards the apple jackpot at (6,7) and (6,8)! It also helps us control the center-right of the board, further trapping the enemy on the left.\n*   **UP (5,7)**: Also good! Puts us right below the apples, setting up a future turn to grab one.\n*   **DOWN (5,5)**: This moves us AWAY from the main objective. It's safe, but it's a defensive, passive play. WE ARE NOT HERE TO BE PASSIVE! WE ARE HERE TO DOMINATE! \ud83d\udc51\n\nTHE WINNING MOVE IS TO PRESS THE ADVANTAGE! Moving RIGHT claims more territory and puts immediate pressure on the apples. We want to get long enough to completely wall off the enemy's escape routes. Our body is already forming a barrier on the left-center. Let's extend that barrier to the right!\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving RIGHT to (6,6), our next move will likely be UP to (6,7) to snag that apple or RIGHT to (7,6) to continue flanking. We gotta stay aggressive and force the enemy into a mistake! LET'S CLOSE THE NET! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nRIGHT",

TIME TO GET AGGRESSIVE! \ud83d\udc0d\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION! WHERE'S HE HEADED NOW? \ud83e\udde0**\nTheir head is at (4,1). They just escaped the left wall. Their safe moves are probably UP, DOWN, RIGHT? Let's check:\n*   UP to (4,2) -> APPLE! They'll go for it! They'll be at (4,2).\n*   DOWN to (4,0) -> Empty, but less likely with an apple above.\n*   RIGHT to (5,1) -> Empty.\nThey are WEAK on the bottom-left! They have 8 apples to our 7.

Look at this wealth! Apples at (6,8), (7,8), (7,9)! We need to consume it ALL and use our growing length to CUT THE BOARD IN HALF!\n\n*   **UP (6,8)**: THE PERFECT MOVE! \ud83d\udca1 We IMMEDIATELY grab another apple, grow to length 8, and position ourselves to control the entire top-right quadrant! From (6,8), next turn we can go RIGHT to (7,8) for another apple or LEFT to (5,8) to start boxing the enemy out. THIS IS MAXIMUM CONTENT AND POSITIONING!\n*   **RIGHT (7,7)**: Also good! Moves us into the cluster, but we DON'T eat this turn. It's a safer, more conservative path. But we are HUNGRY FOR CONTENT!\n*   **LEFT (5,7)**: This moves us AWAY from the apple cluster. It's a defensive, space-controlling move, but why give up free apples? WE ARE PRESSURING!\n\nTHE WINNING MOVE IS TO GO FOR THE THROAT! Eating that apple at (6,8) extends our lead in the growth race and puts us ONE STEP CLOSER to completely trapping the enemy on their side of the board. THEY CAN'T HIDE FOREVER! LET'S GET THIS BAG! \ud83d\udcb0\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving UP to (6,8) and eating, our head will be at (6,8) with apples all around! We will then look to grab (7,8) or (5,8), while simultaneously using our long body to slowly encroach on the enemy's space from the top. WE ARE THE PREDATOR! \ud83e\udd96\n\nUP",

Dropping **DOWN** now gives us the **shortest apple path** and keeps us hugging the bottom wall where the opponent can\u2019t follow without a long trek.\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Future sketch\n- **Turn\u202f26:** **DOWN** to (5,\u202f1).  \n- **Turn\u202f27:** **RIGHT** to (6,\u202f1) \u2192 grab apple.  \n- **Turn\u202f28\u201130:** slide right along y\u202f=\u202f0, munch (6,\u202f0), (7,\u202f0), (8,\u202f0).  \n- Then swing up the right side, cut off any escape routes, and set up a head\u2011on when we\u2019re solidly ahead.\n\nThat\u2019s the play: bite the bottom apples fast, widen our lead, and later corner the high\u2011up rival.

But it doesn't actively pressure the enemy. It's a passive play.\n*   **DOWN (4,7)**: THE AGGRESSIVE TRAP MOVE! \ud83d\ude08 THIS IS IT! This extends our wall straight down, sealing off the column. It brings us CLOSER to the enemy and sets us up to completely cut the board in half. From (4,7), our next move could be LEFT to (3,7) or DOWN to (4,6) (but that's our body, so probably LEFT).

He still has a length advantage, so we can't afford a head-on collision yet. BUT, look at the board! We have him ABOVE us and to the RIGHT. The top-left corner is a mess of apples and our tail. Our mission is to push him towards the TOP-RIGHT CORNER, the deadliest part of the board! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 5)**: This is AGGRESSIVE! We're cutting off his escape to the LEFT. We're building a vertical wall. This move also gets us closer to the apple at (3,2) for a future play.\n*   **UP to (2, 6)**: This moves us parallel to him. It's safer, but it doesn't really pressure him. It might even block our own tail's movement.\n*   **DOWN to (2, 4)**: This moves us AWAY from him. We'd be giving up all the pressure we built! We can't do that! We need to be the predator, not the prey!\n\nCHAT! THE ANSWER IS CLEAR! We go **RIGHT**! We continue our aggressive push! We need to DOMINATE the center and cut the board in half! We force him upwards where the space runs out! LET'S GO!\n\n**FUTURE SELF, LISTEN UP!** We are at (3,5) next. Our goal is to continue pushing right and up, herding Snake #0 into the top-right corner. Watch for his move; if he goes left, we might be able to intercept. If he goes up, we follow. We are the wall. He cannot pass! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

Too risky. |\n| **RIGHT** | (9,6)       | \u2705   | Empty, pushes me toward the wall but still safe; however it moves me away from the juicy apples at (9,7). |\n| **DOWN**  | (8,5)       | \u274c   | My own body \u2013 instant death. |\n\n**\ud83e\udd14 What can the opponent do?**  \n- From (6,6) they can go **UP** (6,7), **LEFT** (5,6) or **RIGHT** (7,6).  \n- The only move that would clash with me is their **RIGHT** into (7,6) **if I chose LEFT** \u2013 another reason to avoid LEFT.\n\n**\ud83d\ude80 Short\u2011term plan**  \n1. **UP** to (8,7) \u2013 stay central, keep three escape routes, and stay one step from the apple cluster at (9,7).  \n2. Watch opponent: if they sprint **UP** we\u2019ll be side\u2011by\u2011side and I can swing right\u2011up to claim (9,7) next turn.  \n3. If they drift **LEFT**, I still have room to circle around and cut\u2011off from the top\u2011right.  \n4. Keep my tail trailing cleanly (the last segment will drop) so I never block my own retreat.\n\nStaying aggressive, yet safe, lets me dominate the board and force the rival into a corner later.

It was a valid move! I MISREAD THE BOARD! HE WASN'T TRAPPED! CHAT, MY BAD! \ud83d\ude05 He outsmarted my prediction!\n\n**OKAY, NEW SITUATION! WE'RE SIDE-BY-SIDE!** Our head (6,6), his head (8,6). This is a STANDOFF!\n\n**CHECKING OUR FOUR MOVES! DON'T GET GREEDY!**\n*   **UP to (6, 7)**: Enemy body at (8,7)? No, board shows empty. OUR body? Our tail is at (2,7)... path looks clear! \u2705 **SAFE!** Gets us closer to that apple cluster at the top!\n*   **DOWN to (6, 5)**: OUR OWN BODY! \ud83d\udc80\u274c **DEATH!** That's our neck! Still blocked!\n*   **LEFT to (5, 6)**: Empty cell! \u2705 **SAFE!** Moves us away from him.\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 6)**: Empty cell! \u2705 **SAFE!** Moves us TOWARDS HIM!

We need to be SMART!\n*   **RIGHT to (7,6)**: High risk of a losing head-on. Too dangerous. \u274c\n*   **UP to (6,7)**: Smart! We move towards the apples at the top right (7,8), (7,9), (9,9). This puts pressure on him by contesting the food! If he follows, we might be able to trap him against the wall. If he doesn't, we GROW and close the score gap! This is the PLAY!\n*   **LEFT to (5,6)**: Retreats to the left side. There's an apple at (5,0) and (0,0), but it gives him free reign over the entire top-right apple cluster. We lose our aggressive positioning. Feels weak. \ud83d\ude15\n\n**FUTURE SELF, LISTEN UP!** We're moving UP to (6,7). He might go for the apples too. Our goal is to get to (7,7) or (7,8) next, but be HYPER-AWARE of where his head is. We need to avoid a head-on until we have more apples! Let's farm and pressure! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

NOPE!\n\nCHAT, WE ONLY HAVE ONE SAFE MOVE! **UP!** \ud83d\ude80\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION FROM (9,9)! WHAT'S HIS PLAY NOW? \ud83e\udde0**\nFrom (9,9):\n- UP: OFF THE BOARD! \ud83d\udc80\u274c **DEATH!**\n- DOWN to (9,8): HIS OWN BODY! \ud83d\udc80\u274c **DEATH!**\n- LEFT to (8,9): If we move there, he crashes into us! Head-on collision! But HE has 19 apples, WE have 10. That's a DOUBLE KO! We can't let that happen! \ud83e\udd2f\n- RIGHT: OFF THE BOARD! \ud83d\udc80\u274c **DEATH!**\n\n**THE FINAL PLAY! CHECKMATE! \ud83d\udd25**\nHe has NO safe moves next turn! If we stay alive this turn, he DIES on turn 46! BUT we have to avoid giving him a head-on collision, which would kill us both!\n*   **Our move to (8,9) is SAFE for us this turn.**\n*   **If he goes LEFT to (8,9)**, it's a head-on collision. DOUBLE KO. He loses, we lose, but he wins because he has more apples! \u274c\n*   **We need to PRAY he doesn't choose that!** But chat, he has NO OTHER OPTIONS! He's forced to crash into us or into a wall/body! This is it!\n\n**FUTURE SELF, THE CALCULATION IS SIMPLE!** We move UP to (8,9). The opponent's fate is sealed. If he goes left, it's a risky double KO where he likely wins on score. If he does anything else, he dies and we win. We've played this perfectly to force him into a no-win scenario. This is the climax! \ud83e\udd1e\n\nUP",
