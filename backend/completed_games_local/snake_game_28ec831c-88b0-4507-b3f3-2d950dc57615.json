There is an available apple at (9, 7), which is directly to the right of my current position.\n\nLet's evaluate the moves:\n\n1.  **RIGHT**: Moves to (9, 7).\n    *   **Safety**: The square (9, 7) is within the board boundaries (0-9). It is not occupied by my body segments (which are at (8, 7) and (8, 6)). The enemy snake is at (4, 2), posing no collision threat.\n    *   **Outcome**: I eat the apple. My score increases to 2, and my snake grows by 1 segment (my tail at (8, 6) will not move forward this turn).\n    *   **Positioning**: I land at the edge of the board, but adjacent to another apple at (9, 8), setting up an easy follow-up move for the next turn.\n\n2.  **UP**: Moves to (8, 8).\n    *   This is a safe move that positions me closer to the apple at (9, 8). However, it forgoes the guaranteed point at (9, 7) this turn.\n\n3.  **LEFT**: Moves to (7, 7).\n    *   Safe, but moves me away from the cluster of apples on the right side of the board.\n\n4.  **DOWN**: Moves to (8, 6).\n    *   **Fatal**: This moves my head directly into my own body segment (the neck at (8, 6)). According to the rules, moving backwards into your own body results in death.\n\n**Conclusion**: Moving RIGHT is the optimal choice. It safely secures an apple immediately, increasing my lead over the opponent, and sets up a favorable position to get another apple on the next turn.\n\nStrategy Note: Move RIGHT to eat the apple at (9, 7). Next turn, move UP to eat the apple at (9, 8). Be aware that your tail will stay at (8, 6) after this move due to growth, so the space behind you will remain occupied.\n\nRIGHT",

Collides with my own neck.\n\nI need to evaluate the best strategic move.\n*   **Apples**: There are apples at (0, 8) and (2, 8) forming a cluster on the top row. There is a single apple at (7, 4).\n*   **Enemy**: The enemy is at (1, 3), near the apple at (2, 3). They are far from the top row cluster.\n*   **Efficiency**:\n    *   Going **LEFT** allows me to traverse row 8 directly to eat (2, 8) in 4 turns, and then (0, 8) shortly after.\n    *   Going **DOWN** gets me to (7, 4) in 3 turns, but subsequent apples are much further away.\n    *   Going **UP** is safe but requires maneuvering down the edge to reach the apples, which takes more turns than going directly Left on row 8.\n\n**Conclusion**: Moving **LEFT** is the most efficient path to a dense cluster of safe apples. It maintains distance from the wall at x=9, reducing the risk of being boxed in by my own body.\n\nLEFT",

I would eventually have to move back down to collect them, which is inefficient.\n3.  **DOWN (6, 7)**: This moves away from the cluster of apples on row 8 towards the isolated apple at (7, 4). This is safe but less efficient than targeting the cluster, which yields more points quickly and blocks the enemy from reaching the top-left area.\n4.  **LEFT (5, 8)**: This moves along row 8 directly towards the apples at (2, 8) and (0, 8).

It is safe, but it does not make progress towards the apples on the current row (y=8). It adds an unnecessary turn.\n3.  **DOWN (3, 7)**: This moves away from the cluster of apples on row 8. While safe, it abandons the easily accessible points on the top row to chase apples further away.\n4.  **LEFT (2, 8)**: This moves onto the cell containing an apple. The path is clear of obstacles and my own body. The enemy snake is located at (4, 2) and poses no immediate threat.\n\n**Strategy**:\nThere is an apple immediately adjacent to my left at (2, 8). By moving Left, I consume this apple, increasing my score to 5 and taking the lead over Snake #1 (who has 4). After eating, I will be positioned to continue towards the apple at (0, 8).\n\n**Conclusion**:\nMoving **LEFT** is the optimal choice to safely gain a point and establish a lead.\n\nLEFT",

Moving **LEFT** to (3,2) advances me toward this apple, increasing my chance to collect it and grow.  \n\n### Step 3: Ensure future options  \nMoving **LEFT** keeps my body in a linear path (4,2) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (2,2), avoiding dead ends. This leaves multiple safe follow-up moves to navigate without immediate danger.  \n\nLEFT",
