          "rationale": "First, I need to understand the current board state and my position. My snake (ID 0) is at (0, 2) with no body, so I'm just a single head segment. The enemy snake #1 is at (8, 7) with no body. Apples are at (9, 8), (6, 3), (5, 0), (2, 6), and (9, 6).\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right. From the board state, row 9 is the top row, and row 0 is the bottom row. Column 0 is left, column 9 is right.\n\nMy head is at (0, 2). Let me visualize the area around me:\n\n- At (0, 2), I'm on the left edge.\n- Above me: (0, 3) \u2013 from the board, row 3 is \".\" so empty.\n- Below me: (0, 1) \u2013 row 1 is \".\" so empty.\n- Right: (1, 2) \u2013 from board, row 2 is \"0 . . . . . . . . .\" so (1,2) is empty (the \"0\" is at (0,2), and dots after are empty).\n- Left: (-1, 2) \u2013 outside the board, so I can't go left.\n\nSo, immediate possible moves: UP to (0,3), DOWN to (0,1), RIGHT to (1,2). LEFT is invalid because it's out of bounds.\n\nNow, I need to check for immediate dangers in these moves.\n\nFirst, moving LEFT is out of bounds, so that would kill me. So LEFT is eliminated.\n\nNow, for UP to (0,3): Is there any snake body there? My body is none, so only enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (8,7) and no body, so (0,3) should be empty. Similarly, DOWN to (0,1) and RIGHT to (1,2) should be empty. From the board state, all these positions are dots, meaning empty.\n\nBut I need to consider that snakes move simultaneously. So, even if a square is empty now, another snake might move into it at the same time.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (8,7). I need to predict where it might move. The enemy might move in any direction, but I don't know its strategy. However, for safety, I should avoid moving towards where the enemy might be, but since it's far away, it might not be an immediate concern.\n\nAlso, I should consider apples and try to move towards them. The closest apples to me: from (0,2), let's see the distances.\n\nApples: (9,8), (6,3), (5,0), (2,6), (9,6)\n\nCompute distances to my position (0,2):\n\n- (9,8): delta x=9, delta y=6, distance 15\n- (6,3): delta x=6, delta y=1, distance 7\n- (5,0): delta x=5, delta y=2, distance 7\n- (2,6): delta x=2, delta y=4, distance 6\n- (9,6): delta x=9, delta y=4, distance 13\n\nSo the closest apples are (2,6) with distance 6, then (6,3) and (5,0) with distance 7.\n\nBut distance might not be the best metric because of obstacles and paths.\n\nNow, from (0,2), if I move UP to (0,3), I'm moving towards the top, but (0,3) is on the left edge. If I go UP repeatedly, I might reach row 9, but there are apples at (2,6) and others.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0,1), I'm going towards bottom left. The apple at (5,0) is at bottom, but (5,0) is column 5, row 0. From (0,1), to reach (5,0), I need to go right and down, but since I'm at row 1, going down to row 0 would be direct.\n\nBut let's see the path: from (0,2) to (0,1) to (0,0) to (1,0) etc. But (0,0) might be safe? From board, row 0 is \". . . . . A . . . .\" so (0,0) is empty, (1,0) empty, etc. But there's an apple at (5,0), so if I go down, I might aim for that.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1,2), I'm moving towards the center. From (1,2), I can go to (2,2), etc., towards apple at (2,6) which is close.\n\nNow, I need to consider the enemy snake. Enemy is at (8,7). From the board, it's near the top right. There are apples at (9,8) and (9,6), which are close to it. So the enemy might move towards those apples.\n\nBut since the game is simultaneous, I don't know what it will do. However, for my decision, I need to avoid moves that might lead to head-on collision or other dangers.\n\nFirst, let's list all possible moves from (0,2):\n\n- UP: to (0,3)\n- DOWN: to (0,1)\n- RIGHT: to (1,2)\n\nLEFT is invalid.\n\nNow, check if any of these moves are immediately dangerous.\n\nImmediate danger means: moving into a wall, into my own body, or into another snake's body.\n\n- My body: none, so no self-collision.\n- Another snake's body: enemy has no body, only head at (8,7), which is far away, so no body collision.\n- Wall: only LEFT is wall, others are within board.\n\nSo all three moves are immediately safe from immediate death.\n\nBut I also need to consider that if another snake moves into the cell I'm moving to, we might have a head-on collision if both move to the same cell. But since the enemy is at (8,7), and I'm at (0,2), it's unlikely that it moves to the same cell as me in one turn, because the distance is large. From (8,7) to (0,2), delta x=8, delta y=5, so minimum moves to reach me is 13 steps, so in one turn, it can't reach me. Similarly, I can't reach it. So no head-on collision risk with the enemy in this turn.\n\nTherefore, all three moves are safe from immediate collision.\n\nNow, among these, I need to choose the one that helps me get apples and keeps future options open.\n\nLet me consider each direction:\n\n1. UP to (0,3): This is moving along the left edge. From (0,3), I can go UP to (0,4), DOWN back to (0,2), or RIGHT to (1,3). So I have three options from (0,3), but moving along the edge might limit me if I go too high, but since the board is open, it should be fine. However, apples are not directly above me; the closest apple is (2,6), which is to the right and up. So if I go UP, I need to eventually go right. But from (0,3), going RIGHT to (1,3) is possible, and then towards (2,6).\n\n2. DOWN to (0,1): This is moving down towards the bottom. From (0,1), I can go DOWN to (0,0), UP back to (0,2), or RIGHT to (1,1). (0,0) is within board, and from there, I can go to (1,0), etc. The apple at (5,0) is on row 0, so if I go DOWN, I might be able to reach it by going along the bottom row. But from (0,1) to (5,0), I need to go to (0,0) then right to (5,0), which is 5 steps right, but since I move one step per turn, it might take time. Also, there might be other apples closer.\n\n3. RIGHT to (1,2): This moves me into the board. From (1,2), I can go UP to (1,3), DOWN to (1,1), LEFT to (0,2), or RIGHT to (2,2). So more options from here. And I'm moving towards the apple at (2,6), which is only 4 steps away in terms of Manhattan distance? From (1,2) to (2,6), delta x=1, delta y=4, distance 5. But directly, from (1,2) to (2,6), I need to go right and up, but I can only move one step at a time. Similarly, from (0,2) to (2,6) is delta x=2, delta y=4, distance 6.\n\nBut let's think about the path: from (0,2) to (2,6), I need to go right twice and up four times, but since I can move in any order, it should be possible as long as the path is clear.\n\nNow, considering the enemy snake, it might be going for the apples near it, like (9,8) or (9,6). So probably not moving towards me. So I don't need to worry about it for now.\n\nNow, for long-term strategy, I should consider which apple to go for first. The closest apple is (2,6) with distance 6 from (0,2). From (0,2), if I go RIGHT, I start moving towards it. If I go UP, I also need to go right later, but going RIGHT directly might be better.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (5,0) is distance 7, but if I go DOWN, I can go to (0,0) then right, but that might take more moves because from (0,0) to (5,0) is 5 steps right, but from (0,2) to (5,0) via (0,0) is 2 down + 5 right = 7 moves, same as Manhattan distance, so it's efficient. But from (0,2) to (2,6) is 2 right + 4 up = 6 moves, so slightly closer.\n\nBut I need to ensure that the path is safe. From (0,2), going RIGHT to (1,2) seems open.\n\nAlso, I should consider that after eating an apple, I grow, so my tail will be left behind, but since I have no body now, after eating first apple, I will have one body segment. So I need to be careful not to run into myself later.\n\nBut for now, since I have no body, I have more freedom.\n\nNow, let's think about the board state. From the board, most areas are empty, so I have many options.\n\nI should avoid moving into dead ends. For example, if I go UP along the left edge, I might not get trapped because I can always go right. Similarly for down.\n\nBut moving RIGHT seems to open up more of the board immediately.\n\nNow, another thing: the apple at (5,0) is on the bottom row. If I go DOWN to (0,1), then to (0,0), I can then go right along the bottom row to (5,0). But from (0,0), going right is fine, but I need to make sure no other snake is there, but enemy is far away.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,6), from (1,2) I can go to (2,2), then to (2,3), etc., but (2,6) is at row 6, so I need to go up.\n\nFrom the board, between row 2 and row 6, are there any obstacles? From the board state, rows 3,4,5 have dots, so no obstacles. So path is clear.\n\nSimilarly, for bottom row, from (0,0) to (5,0), all are dots, so clear.\n\nNow, I need to decide which apple to pursue first.\n\nBut since the game is early, and I have multiple apples, I might not need to commit yet. I can start moving towards a close apple and see later.\n\nBut for this move, I need to choose one direction.\n\nLet me consider the future options from each move.\n\nIf I move UP to (0,3):\n\n- From (0,3), possible moves: UP to (0,4), DOWN to (0,2), RIGHT to (1,3)\n\n- All these should be safe, as no snakes or walls immediately.\n\n- Moving UP from (0,3) to (0,4) continues along the edge, but I might need to go right eventually to reach apples.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0,1):\n\n- From (0,1), possible moves: DOWN to (0,0), UP to (0,2), RIGHT to (1,1)\n\n- Similar to above.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1,2):\n\n- From (1,2), possible moves: UP to (1,3), DOWN to (1,1), LEFT to (0,2), RIGHT to (2,2)\n\n- This seems to give me more flexibility because I can move in four directions, whereas on the edge, I have only three directions.\n\nSo, from a game theory perspective, moving away from the edge might be better because it keeps more options open.\n\nAlso, from (1,2), I am closer to the center and can reach multiple apples easily.\n\nFor example, from (1,2), I can go towards (2,6) by going up and right, or towards (5,0) by going down and right, or towards (6,3) by going right and up.\n\nWhereas from (0,2) or after moving up/down, I might be constrained to the left side.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT seems advantageous.\n\nMoreover, since the apple at (2,6) is the closest, and I need to move right to get there, moving RIGHT now starts that journey.\n\nIf I move UP or DOWN, I still need to move right later, so moving RIGHT immediately might save a turn.\n\nBut let's calculate the number of turns to reach the apple.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (1,2) on turn 1, then from there, I can go towards (2,6). The shortest path might be: from (1,2) to (2,2) to (2,3) to (2,4) to (2,5) to (2,6) - that's 5 moves, but since I already moved once, after 5 more moves, I reach (2,6) on turn 6? Let's see: after move 1, I'm at (1,2); then after move 2, at (2,2); move 3, (2,3); move 4, (2,4); move 5, (2,5); move 6, (2,6). So on turn 6, I reach the apple if I move directly.\n\nBut I might not move directly if I need to avoid something, but for now, path is clear.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (0,1) on turn 1, then to (0,0) on turn 2, then to (1,0) on turn 3, (2,0) on turn 4, (3,0) on turn 5, (4,0) on turn 6, (5,0) on turn 7. So 7 turns to reach (5,0).\n\nSimilarly, if I move UP to (0,3) on turn 1, then I need to go right, so from (0,3) to (1,3) on turn 2, then to (2,3) on turn 3, but (2,6) is at y=6, so from (2,3) I need to go up to (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) on turns 4,5,6. So from start, after move 1 to (0,3), then move 2 to (1,3), move 3 to (2,3), move 4 to (2,4), move 5 to (2,5), move 6 to (2,6). So also 6 turns, same as going right first? Let's see: from (0,2) if I go right first to (1,2) on turn 1, then from there, as above, to (2,6) in 5 more moves, so on turn 6 I reach (2,6). If I go up first to (0,3) on turn 1, then from (0,3) to (2,6) takes 5 moves? From (0,3) to (2,6): delta x=2, delta y=3, so Manhattan distance 5, so after turn 1, I need 5 moves, so on turn 6 I reach (2,6). Same number of turns.\n\nBut when I go right first, after turn 1, I'm at (1,2), which is closer to the apple than (0,3)? From (1,2) to (2,6) distance |1-2| + |2-6| = 1+4=5, from (0,3) to (2,6) distance |0-2| + |3-6| = 2+3=5, so same Manhattan distance. So equally close.\n\nBut from (1,2), I have more options because I'm not on the edge.\n\nAlso, from (1,2), I can reach other apples easier. For example, apple at (6,3): from (1,2) to (6,3) distance |1-6| + |2-3| = 5+1=6, whereas from (0,3) to (6,3) distance |0-6| + |3-3| = 6+0=6, same. But from (1,2), I might go directly right and up.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on the closest apple.\n\nAnother apple: (6,3) is at distance 7 from (0,2), same as (5,0). (2,6) is distance 6, so closest.\n\nSo I should go for (2,6) first.\n\nTo go to (2,6), I need to move right and up. From (0,2), if I move RIGHT, I get to (1,2), which is on the path. If I move UP, I get to (0,3), which is also on the path if I go right later, but moving RIGHT first might be better because it moves me directly towards the apple in terms of x-coordinate.\n\nSince the apple is at x=2, and I'm at x=0, I need to increase x. So moving RIGHT is directly towards it in the x-direction.\n\nSimilarly, moving UP is towards it in y-direction, but since x=0, I need to increase x anyway.\n\nSo moving RIGHT seems more direct.\n\nMoreover, if I move UP, I might be moving away from other apples like (5,0) or (6,3), but since I'm going for (2,6), it should be fine.\n\nBut let's consider the enemy snake. The enemy is at (8,7). If I move towards (2,6), which is in the left center, while enemy is on the right, so no conflict.\n\nAlso, if I move RIGHT, I am moving towards the center, which might be good for future flexibility.\n\nNow, about the move: I need to ensure that after my move, I don't put myself in a position where I might be trapped or have limited options.\n\nFrom (1,2), as I said, I have four directions, all should be safe for now.\n\nIf I move UP to (0,3), I have three directions, but still safe.\n\nSimilarly for DOWN.\n\nBut since moving RIGHT gives me more options, I prefer that.\n\nAlso, in the decision process, I should favor moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available.\n\nFrom (0,2), moving RIGHT to (1,2) gives me four follow-up moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nMoving UP to (0,3) gives three: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (since LEFT is out of board).\n\nSimilarly for DOWN.\n\nSo moving RIGHT maximizes the number of immediate next moves.\n\nTherefore, I should move RIGHT.\n\nBut let's double-check if there is any hidden danger.\n\nFor example, if I move to (1,2), is there any apple there? No, apples are at (9,8), etc., not at (1,2).\n\nAlso, enemy snake might move, but as I said, it's far away.\n\nAnother thing: since snakes move simultaneously, I need to consider if the enemy might move towards me, but from (8,7) to (1,2) is too far, so no.\n\nSo, I think RIGHT is a good move.\n\nNow, for the long-term plan, I should note that I am going for the apple at (2,6) first.\n\nSo, I can write a rationale.\n\nBut the instruction says: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo, I should include a plan before my move.\n\nBut in the response, I need to have the move on the last line.\n\nSo, I'll write my reasoning and plan, then the move.\n\nPlan: I am moving RIGHT to start approaching the apple at (2,6). From there, I will continue towards it while avoiding dangers.\n\nNow, for the move, I think RIGHT is safe and beneficial.\n\nBut let's confirm all moves:\n\n- UP: to (0,3) - safe, but less options.\n\n- DOWN: to (0,1) - safe, but might be going towards (5,0), but (2,6) is closer.\n\n- RIGHT: to (1,2) - safe, more options, towards closest apple.\n\nSo, I choose RIGHT.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHTI am at (0,2) with no body, so I have multiple safe moves: UP to (0,3), DOWN to (0,1), or RIGHT to (1,2). LEFT is invalid as it would move me out of bounds. None of these moves immediately cause self-collision or collision with the enemy snake (which is at (8,7), far away). Among these, moving RIGHT to (1,2) is optimal because it increases my board position flexibility (from (1,2) I have four possible next moves, while from edge positions I have only three) and directly starts moving me towards the closest apple at (2,6), which is only 6 units away in Manhattan distance. Moving UP or DOWN would also eventually require moving right, but RIGHT immediately begins the approach without wasting turns. The enemy snake is unlikely to reach me this turn due to the distance, so head-on collision is not a concern.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue towards apple at (2,6) after moving to (1,2). Monitor enemy movements, but focus on collecting apples while maintaining escape routes.\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #0 is currently at (1, 2), much closer to the apples on the left side of the board. \n\nI will move UP to collect the apple at (9, 8). This keeps me along the edge for now.

(6, 5) is to the right.\n\n**Threat Assessment (Simultaneous Move Prediction):**\n1.  **Enemy Snake #1:**\n    *   **Current Head:** (8, 6)\n    *   **Possible Moves:**\n        *   **UP to (8, 7):** This is currently occupied by its own body. Snake #1 dies (crash into self).\n        *   **DOWN to (8, 5):** Empty. Safe.\n        *   **LEFT to (7, 6):** Empty. Safe.\n        *   **RIGHT to (9, 6):** Contains an apple. Safe, and it will grow.\n    *   **Head-on Collision Risk:** Snake #1's current body is at (8, 7). If I move **UP** to (2, 5) -> (2, 6), and Snake #1 moves **UP** to (8, 7) -> (8, 6), there is no head-on collision because our paths don't cross (I am at x=2, it is at x=8). If Snake #1 moves **DOWN**, **LEFT**, or **RIGHT**, it moves away from me. There is no scenario where Snake #1 moves into cell (2, 6).\n\n2.  **My Possible Moves:**\n    *   **UP (to 2, 6):** Contains an apple. This is the target. Is it safe?\n        *   *Board Check:* Cell is empty except for the apple.\n        *   *Collision Check:* Snake #1 is at x=8 or x=7. It cannot reach x=2 in one turn. The move is safe.\n    *   **DOWN (to 2, 4):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT (to 1, 5):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (to 3, 5):** Empty. Safe.\n\n**Strategic Conclusion:**\nMoving **UP** secures an apple immediately, extending my length and increasing my score. It is mathematically safe from the enemy snake given the distance and the board layout. While I should be wary of the body at (2, 5) becoming an obstacle in future turns, securing points and extending length is the primary objective. The immediate safety check confirms no collision is possible this turn.\n\nMy plan is to move UP to eat the apple at (2, 6). This puts my head at (2, 6) and my tail will remain at (2, 4) (since I grew, the tail doesn't move this turn).\n\nUP",

We are on the far right edge.\n\nEvaluation of Moves:\n1. UP: Moves to (9, 7). Safe. Puts head near (8, 8) and (2, 9), but (8, 8) is very close.\n2. DOWN: Moves to (9, 5). Safe. Moves toward the apples at (6, 5) and (6, 3).\n3. LEFT: Moves to (8, 6). **DEATH** (Collides with own body).\n4. RIGHT: Moves to (10, 6). **DEATH** (Off board).\n\nAnalysis of Safe Options:\n- There are two safe moves: UP and DOWN.\n- If I move UP to (9, 7), the next move can be UP to (9, 8) or LEFT to (8, 7) (collision risk if body hasn't moved). Wait, actually if I move UP to (9, 7), (8, 7) will still be occupied by the tail this turn.\n- If I move DOWN to (9, 5), I have a clear path along the wall and can then turn left toward the cluster of apples at column 6.\n- The apple at (8, 8) is very close. If I go UP to (9, 7), then UP to (9, 8), then LEFT to (8, 8), I collect it.\n- However, moving UP puts me higher on the board where fewer apples are clustered compared to the lower half.\n\nDecision:\nThe move UP to (9, 7) is efficient for targeting the apple at (8, 8). From (9, 7), I can then move towards (8, 8). Snake #0 is far away at x=2, so there's no immediate pressure.\n\nPlan:\nMove UP to (9, 7) to approach the apple at (8, 8).

UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are physically safe.\n\n**2. Enemy Snake #1 Analysis:**\n- **Position:** Head (9, 6), Body [(8, 6), (8, 7)].\n- **Threat:** Enemy is currently at x=9. The board width is 10 (indices 0-9). To attack me (at x=2), the enemy would need to move Left to (8, 6) or (8, 7).\n- **Body Block:** The cells (8, 6) and (8, 7) are explicitly listed as the enemy's *Body*.\n    - Standard snake rules usually prevent the head from moving into its own body (causing suicide).\n    - Even if we assume the enemy might \"hack\" or the rules are non-standard, the prompt rules state: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n    - If Enemy #1 moves Left, its head moves into (8, 6), which is its own body. This results in the enemy's death.\n- **Self-Preservation:** If the enemy dies by moving into its own body, its body segments (8, 6) and (8, 7) effectively remain as static obstacles (since the snake is dead). The turn happens simultaneously, so if I move UP to (2, 7) and the enemy suicide-moves Left to (8, 6), I am safe at (2, 7) and the enemy is dead.\n- **Safe Moves for Enemy:** The only moves the enemy can make to stay alive are Down to (9, 5) or possibly Right (if allowed, though x=9 is the edge, likely blocked). The enemy *cannot* move Left to attack me without committing suicide.\n- **Result:** The enemy cannot reach me this turn.\n\n**3. Strategic Analysis of Safe Moves (UP vs. LEFT/RIGHT):**\n- **Goal:** Survive, eat apples, avoid trapping myself.\n- **Current Board State (Y=7 to Y=9):**\n    - Row 9 (Y=9): `A` at (2, 9). (I am at X=2).\n    - Row 8 (Y=8): `T` (Enemy Body) at (8, 8). Empty at (2, 8).\n    - Row 7 (Y=7): Empty at (2, 7).\n- **Move UP (to 2, 7):**\n    - Moves me directly below the apple at (2, 9).\n    - Keeps X=2 fixed, offering a direct path to the apple at (2, 9) in 2 turns (2,7 -> 2,8 -> 2,9).\n    - Leaves options open to veer Left or Right later if needed.\n- **Move LEFT/RIGHT (to 1,6 or 3,6):**\n    - Moves me away from the X=2 column apple cluster (at 2,9).\n    - Forces me to maneuver back towards X=2 to claim that apple, wasting turns.\n    - Does not offer any immediate advantage over UP.\n    - Moving RIGHT (to 3,6) moves me slightly closer to the central apple at (6,5), but that is far away (distance 3) and I am currently tracking the closer apple at (2,9).\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nMoving UP is the optimal move. It avoids immediate death (unlike DOWN), avoids the enemy (who is effectively paralyzed/blocked by their own body), and positions me perfectly to chase the accessible apple at (2, 9). It maintains maximum flexibility.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

If the enemy moves **LEFT**, they go to (8, 7). This is physically far from me (x=8 vs x=2).\n    - If the enemy moves **DOWN** (to 9, 6), they collide with their own body segment at (9, 6) and die. This is unlikely optimal play unless forced.\n    - **Conclusion:** The enemy will likely prioritize the central apple (6, 5). A move **LEFT** or **DOWN** (suicide) are their only options to approach it. Even if they move **LEFT**, they remain far away (x=8). No immediate collision threat.\n\n**3. Strategic Analysis of Safe Moves (UP vs. LEFT/RIGHT):**\n- **Goal:** Eat apples and survive. The closest apple is **(2, 9)**. It is located directly above me (distance 2).\n- **Move UP (to 2, 8):**\n    - **Pros:** Moves directly towards apple (2, 9). Maintains the \"X=2\" column path. Keeps the path to (2, 9) open for the next turn.\n    - **Cons:** None immediate.\n- **Move LEFT (to 1, 7):**\n    - **Pros:** None.\n    - **Cons:** Moves away from apple (2, 9). Creates distance that needs to be covered later.\n- **Move RIGHT (to 3, 7):**\n    - **Pros:** None.\n    - **Cons:** Moves away from apple (2, 9). Moves me closer to the enemy's potential path (center board), increasing future risk unnecessarily.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nMoving **UP** is the optimal move. It progresses directly towards the nearest and safest apple at (2, 9). It maintains a straight line for the next turn (2, 8 -> 2, 9), securing a point soon. The enemy is not an immediate threat due to distance and board edges.\n**END RATIONALE**\nUP",

Given the board edge position, the enemy is likely to move LEFT to (8, 8) to eat the apple there.\n*   **Collision Risk:**\n    *   If Enemy moves **LEFT** to (8, 8): No collision with me (I am at x=2).\n    *   If Enemy moves **DOWN** to (9, 7): Hits own body (tail at 9,7), Enemy dies.

The apple at (2, 9) is right in front of me.\n*   **Move UP (to 2, 9):**\n    *   **Action:** Eats an apple.\n    *   **Result:** I grow. The tail at (2, 7) does not move this turn.\n    *   **Future:** On the next turn, my tail will be at (2, 7) (assuming I don't eat again), freeing up (2, 8) for movement. This allows me to continue moving along the top edge or drop down.\n    *   **Board Edge:** I will be at the top row (y=9). I cannot move UP next turn, but LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN will be available (depending on body position).\n*   **Move LEFT (to 1, 8):**\n    *   **Action:** Moves away from the apple at (2, 9).\n    *   **Cons:** Leaves a valuable point behind. Splits focus.\n*   **Move RIGHT (to 3, 8):**\n    *   **Action:** Moves away from the apple at (2, 9).\n    *   **Cons:** Same as LEFT.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nMoving **UP** is the best choice. It secures a guaranteed point immediately. Since I am moving onto an apple, I grow, meaning my tail remains at (2, 7) for this turn. This is safe because I am moving into (2, 9), and the only cell my tail would vacate is (2, 7), which is not the destination of my head. I will be at (2, 9) next turn, free to move LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN to plan my next move towards the cluster of apples at (6, 3), (6, 5), etc.\n**END RATIONALE**\nUP",

However, looking at the board, the bulk of apples are at y=5 and below. There are no apples on the top row (y=9) or near it. Heading right along the top row pushes me further away from the central vertical path. I will likely need to turn down eventually, but staying at y=9 limits my downwards options as I move right.\n-   **Moving DOWN to (3, 8):** This starts the descent towards the central apples. The closest apples are at (4, 5), (6, 3), (5, 0), (4, 0). The apple at (6, 5) is also accessible. Moving down puts me on the vertical axis x=3, which is a good vantage point. Looking at the board, x=3 is clear for a while.\n\nRISK ASSESSMENT:\n-   **Enemy #1:** Head at (7, 8). He is far away. He cannot reach me this turn.\n-   **Future Mobility:** If I go DOWN to (3, 8), the cell (3, 9) becomes my tail (if I don't eat). (3, 8) is currently empty. From (3, 8), I can go DOWN to (3, 7), LEFT to (2, 8), or RIGHT to (4, 8). (2, 8) is currently my body, but it will shift down by next turn if I don't eat, so it might be available. Actually, if I move DOWN to (3, 8), my body becomes [(3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)]. (2, 8) is still occupied. So from (3, 8), DOWN to (3, 7) is safe. LEFT to (2, 8) is bad (suicide). RIGHT to (4, 8) is currently empty. So DOWN gives me a path downwards.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 9):\n-   New Head: (4, 9).\n-   New Body: [(3, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8)].\n-   From (4, 9), I can go DOWN to (4, 8) (empty), LEFT to (3, 9) (occupied by my body), or RIGHT to (5, 9) (empty).\n-   This is also safe.\n\nHowever, the apples are primarily at lower Y coordinates. Descending is the priority to reach them.\nThe apple at (4, 5) is a likely first target.\nIf I move DOWN now, I am at (3, 8).\nNext turn, I can likely continue DOWN to (3, 7), (3, 6), etc.\nThe path at x=3 looks clear down to y=0 based on the board map.\nRow 8: `. . . . . . . . 1 T T` -> (3, 8) is clear.\nRow 7: `. . . . . . . . . .

To get to the apple at (6, 5), the path is LEFT + DOWN + DOWN. \n- Moving LEFT (6, 7) immediately puts me on the same x-column as an apple and allows me to move DOWN towards row 5.\n- Moving DOWN (7, 6) keeps me further right but closer to the row index of the apples.\n\nComparison:\n- LEFT (6, 7) is a strong move because it aligns with (6, 5) and (6, 3) while keeping me away from the right edge.\n- DOWN (7, 6) is also viable, but aligning with the column early allows for more straightforward navigation.\n\nTrajectory check:\nSnake #0 will likely move DOWN or RIGHT. If it moves DOWN towards (3, 7), (3, 6), etc., it is heading for (4, 5) and the apples at (4, 0)/(5, 0).\nBy moving LEFT then DOWN, I can contest the central board.\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to (6, 7), then look to move DOWN towards the apple at (6, 5).\n\nLEFT",

If I don't eat this turn, (3, 9) becomes my tail, but since I haven't eaten, my tail stays at (2, 9) and the body segment at (3, 9) remains for this turn. Moving into it is suicide. **DEAD.**\n2.  **DOWN (to 3, 7):** Currently empty. Enemy #1 is at (7, 7), so no collision risk. **SAFE.**\n3.  **LEFT (to 2, 8):** Currently empty. However, the cell (2, 8) is adjacent to the enemy head (7, 7) is far, but wait. Let's check safety. The enemy is at (7, 7). My body is at (3, 9) and (2, 9). (2, 8) is empty. **SAFE.**\n4.  **RIGHT (to 4, 8):** Currently empty. **SAFE.**\n\n**STRATEGIC CONSIDERATION:**\nI am at (3, 8). I want to reach the apples at (4, 5), (6, 5), and (6, 3).\n-   **Moving DOWN to (3, 7):** This is the most direct route to the central area. From (3, 7), I have a clear vertical path down to y=0 at x=3. This keeps my options open to pivot left towards (4, 5) or continue down to (5, 0) / (4, 0).\n-   **Moving LEFT to (2, 8):** This moves me away from the central apples and closer to the left wall. Less optimal.\n-   **Moving RIGHT to (4, 8):** This moves me towards the center but delays the descent. The apples are lower down (y=5 and y=0). Delaying the descent puts me behind on turns.\n\n**RISK ASSESSMENT:**\n-   **Enemy #1:** Head at (7, 7). He is far to the right. He is unlikely to intercept me if I stay on the left side of the board.\n-   **Future Mobility:** Moving DOWN to (3, 7) opens up (3, 6), (3, 5), etc. It is the most efficient path to the food. The apple at (4, 5) is the closest high-value target (since (5, 0) is very low).\n\n**DECISION:**\nMove DOWN to (3, 7) to descend towards the central apples and maintain a clear path.\n\n**PLANNING:**\n-   Turn 12: Move DOWN to (3, 6).\n-   Turn 13: Move DOWN to (3, 5).\n-   Turn 14: Move RIGHT to (4, 5) to eat the apple.\n\nDOWN",

The closest high-value apple is at (4, 5).\nMy current trajectory from the last turn was DOWN. Continuing DOWN puts me on a direct path to (4, 5) via (3, 5).\n-   Path: (3, 6) -> (3, 5) -> (4, 5).\n-   Alternatively, going RIGHT now to (4, 7) -> (4, 6) -> (4, 5) is also a valid path.\n\nHowever, looking at the bottom of the board (Row 0), there are apples at (4, 0) and (5, 0). To be competitive with Snake #1 (who has 3 apples to my 2), I need to eat efficiently.\nIf I go DOWN now, I have an open corridor at X=3 to drop all the way to the bottom if needed. If I go RIGHT, I might run into the \"T\" (tail of Snake #1) at (8, 8) or other obstacles later. Staying on the left side (X=3) is safer from the enemy who is on the right (X=6).\n\nIf I go DOWN, I get to (3, 6).\nNext turn, I can go DOWN to (3, 5).\nNext turn, I can go RIGHT to (4, 5) to eat the apple. This is a 3-turn plan to eat.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 7), I move away from the center apples.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 7), I am moving towards the enemy's side of the board. The enemy head is at (6, 7). The difference in X is 2 (4 vs 6). If I go RIGHT and he goes LEFT, we don't collide (4->5 vs 6->5), but if we both go for (5, 7), we collide. However, since he is currently at (6, 7), he is actually at the same Y coordinate as me.\nWait, looking at the board:\nRow 7: `. . . 0 . . 1 T . .`\nMy head is at (3, 7). Enemy head is at (6, 7).\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 7), and Enemy goes LEFT to (5, 7), we are safe.\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 7), and Enemy goes UP to (6, 8), he hits the T at (6, 8)? No, the board shows T at (6, 8) is empty in the text description? No, the board text shows `.` at (6, 8).\nLet's look at the Board State provided:\nRow 8: `. . . T . . . T T .`\nRow 7: `. . . 0 . . 1 T . .`\nEnemy #1 head at (6, 7). Body at (7, 7), (7, 8), (8, 8).\nSo (6, 8) is empty.\n\nRegardless, moving DOWN to (3, 6) seems to be the most conservative and strategic move. It maintains distance from the enemy and opens up the vertical path to the (4, 5) apple and the bottom row apples.\n\nI will move DOWN to (3, 6).\n\nShort-term plan:\nMove DOWN to (3, 6). Next turn move DOWN to (3, 5). Then move RIGHT to (4, 5) to eat the apple.\n\nDOWN\nEND LAST RATIONALE",

This is safer and consolidates my control over the left side of the board.\n\n**4. Long-term Plan:**\nMy logic remains consistent with Turn 12. I am executing a 2-turn plan to eat the apple at (4, 5):\n-   **Turn 13 (This turn):** Move DOWN to (3, 5).\n-   **Turn 14 (Next turn):** Move RIGHT to (4, 5) to eat the apple.\n\nMoving DOWN today creates a 2-cell gap between my head and the apple, which is the perfect distance for the simultaneous movement mechanic. It allows me to observe the enemy's move before committing the final direction to the apple.\n\n**Conclusion:** DOWN is the safest move that progresses the plan to eat the apple at (4, 5).\n\nDOWN",

Moves away from active apples and enemy.\n\nStrategic Analysis:\n- The closest apple is at (6, 3). Moving DOWN to (6, 4) puts me one step away from it.\n- Apple at (4, 5) is also near, but Snake #0 is at (3, 5). If I move LEFT to (5, 5) and Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (4, 5), we will be adjacent. If we both move toward (4, 5) on the following turn, a head-on collision at (4, 5) is possible. \n- Moving DOWN is safer as it maintains a vertical distance from Snake #0 while staying on the path to multiple apples (6, 3), (7, 1), and the bottom cluster.\n\nPlan:\nMove DOWN to (6, 4) to approach the apple at (6, 3). This avoids a potential immediate conflict with Snake #0 at (4, 5) and keeps my movement options flexible. From (6, 3), I can decide to head further down toward (7, 1) or sweep left toward (5, 0) and (4, 0).\n\nDOWN",

This grows my length, increases my score to 3, and positions me optimally to plan my next move.\n*   **Alternative Moves:**\n    *   **DOWN:** Moves me to (3, 4).

Outcome:**\n*   **Move RIGHT:** Head moves to (4, 5), eats apple.\n*   **Growth:** The tail does not move (because I ate), so I grow to length 4.

This limits my immediate options towards the densest apple cluster (bottom).\n*   **DOWN (4,4):** Moves me toward the apples at (4,0) and (5,0). This is a proactive move toward a score. It leaves both LEFT and RIGHT open for the next turn (I can go to (3,4) or (5,4)).\n*   **RIGHT (5,5):** Moves me toward the apples at (6,3) and (7,1). However, I have to traverse through (5,5), (5,4)... towards (5,0). This is a valid path.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving DOWN is a strong choice. It moves me towards the bottom apples (4,0) and (5,0) and keeps my future options open (I can turn Left or Right next turn). It keeps me clear of the enemy to the right.\n\n**Move:** DOWN\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Strategic Analysis:**\n*   **Objective:** I have 3 apples. Enemy has 5. I need to catch up. Apples are at (5,0), (4,0), (7,1), (0,5), (8,7).\n*   **Current Path:** I successfully moved DOWN to (4,4) as planned last turn.\n*   **Target:** The bottom apples (4,0) and (5,0) are the most logical and accessible targets to start closing the score gap. They are clustered, allowing for efficient growth.\n*   **Path to Bottom:**\n    *   From (4,4), moving DOWN to (4,3) puts me one step closer.\n    *   Alternatively, (3,4) or (5,4) keep me in the same row but shift horizontally.\n\n**3. Enemy Prediction (Snake #1):**\n*   **Position:** (6, 3).\n*   **Context:** There is an apple at (6, 3) and another at (7, 1).\n*   **Prediction:** Since the enemy head is currently ON an apple (6,3) according to the provided map (Apple at 6,3; Enemy head at 6,3), they have already eaten it. They will likely look for the next closest apple. The apple at (7, 1) is very close. They will likely move DOWN and then RIGHT, or LEFT and then DOWN.\n*   **Collision Risk:** The enemy is at x=6, y=3. I am at x=4, y=4. The minimum distance between us is 1+1 = 2 cells. If I move DOWN to (4,3) and they move Left to (5,3), the distance becomes 1. If I stay at (4,4) and they move Left to (5,3), distance is 2. If I move DOWN, I am closer to the bottom apples.\n\n**4. Move Evaluation:**\n*   **UP (4,5):** Moving back towards my body and away from the bottom apples. Dead end potential. **Bad.**\n*   **DOWN (4,3):** Moves directly towards the target cluster (4,0)/(5,0). This is the most efficient path. **Strong Candidate.**\n*   **LEFT (3,4):** Moves away from the (5,0) apple and towards the wall. While safe, it drifts away from the central cluster. **Suboptimal.**\n*   **RIGHT (5,4):** Moves towards (5,0). This is a valid alternative to DOWN. However, moving DOWN keeps me directly aligned with (4,0), creating a potential vertical tunnel. If I move RIGHT now, I might encounter my own body later if I turn down (since (4,5) is my body). Moving DOWN opens up both LEFT and RIGHT for the turn after next.\n\n**Conclusion:** DOWN is the most assertive move towards the closest apple cluster. It keeps the path to (4,0) open and maintains flexibility.\n**Plan:** Move DOWN to (4,3). Next turn, likely move DOWN to (4,2) or (4,1) to reach the apple at (4,0).\nEND RATIONALE\nDOWN",

Body: [(4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)].\n- Apples at: (5, 0), (0, 5), (8, 7), (5, 3), (1, 0).\n\nPotential Moves for Head (7, 0):\n1. UP: (7, 1). **DEATH** (Backwards into body).\n2. DOWN: Out of bounds (y < 0). **DEATH**.\n3. RIGHT: (8, 0). Safe. Moves away from apples but maintains space.\n4. LEFT: (6, 0). Safe. Directly towards apple at (5, 0).\n\nStrategic Analysis:\n- Snake #0 is at (4, 0). The apple at (5, 0) is situated exactly between us at (7, 0) and (4, 0).\n- If I move LEFT to (6, 0) and Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (5, 0), the next turn we would be at (6, 0) and (5, 0) respectively. I would be adjacent to the enemy head.\n- However, Snake #0 is currently in a very restricted position. Their body is at (4, 1-4). If they move RIGHT to (5, 0), they are moving toward me. If they move UP to (4, 1), they hit their own body. They must move LEFT or RIGHT.\n- If I move LEFT to (6, 0), I am one step away from the apple at (5, 0).\n- I need to be careful of a head-on collision at (5, 0) in two turns, but for this specific turn, LEFT is the most aggressive and rewarding move to secure the bottom area.\n\nPlan:\nMove LEFT to (6, 0) to contest the apple at (5, 0) and (1, 0). This keeps the enemy snake pinned against their own tail or forced into a confrontation where I have slightly more tail length/maneuverability behind me if I pivot correctly.\n\nLEFT",

Moving here would result in immediate death. **Unsafe.**\n2.  **LEFT to (3, 0):** This is on the board and currently empty. It does not collide with my body (which is at x=4). It does not collide with Snake #1 (Head at (7, 0), Body at x=6 or y>0). This move is safe.\n3.  **RIGHT to (5, 0):** This is an apple ('A'). It is on the board and not occupied by my body. It is not occupied by Snake #1 (Head is at (7,0)). This move is safe and allows me to grow.\n4.  **DOWN:** Moving down from (4, 0) would go to (4, -1), which is outside the board. **Unsafe.**\n\n**Comparison of safe moves (LEFT and RIGHT):**\n\n*   **LEFT (3, 0):** Moves me away from the apples at (4, 0) and (5, 0) and towards the open left side of the board.\n*   **RIGHT (5, 0):** Moves me directly onto an apple. This increases my score and length immediately. With a length of 5 (including the new head), I will have space to maneuver after eating. My tail is currently at (4, 4). When I move to (5, 0), my body will shift, and the tail will move to (4, 3). The cell (5, 1) is currently empty (Snake #1 is at x=6). Therefore, I will have an escape route upwards in the next turn.\n\nSince securing an apple is the objective and RIGHT is safe with an immediate escape route, it is the best move.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat the apple at (5, 0). From there, I will likely move UP to (5, 1) or LEFT to (4, 0) (which will be empty as my body moves) to position myself for the next apples, while keeping a safe distance from Snake #1.\n\nRIGHT",

RIGHT (6, 0) - **HEAD-ON COLLISION** if I move left. DOWN - **DEATH** (Bounds).\n   - Thus, Snake #0 will likely go UP to (5, 1) or try to collide with me at (6, 0).\n\nWait, I have no legal moves! \n- UP is (6, 1) which is my body.\n- DOWN is out of bounds.\n- RIGHT is (7, 0) which is my body.\n- LEFT is (5, 0) which is Snake #0's head.\n\nRe-checking My Body: Head (6, 0). Body: [(7, 0), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4)].\n- (7, 0) is behind me. (6, 1) is above me.\n- If I move LEFT to (5, 0), I am entering the square where Snake #0's head currently is. Since moves are simultaneous, Snake #0 will move *out* of (5, 0) this turn. \n\nIs (5, 0) safe? \n- If Snake #0 moves to (5, 1) or (6, 0), (5, 0) becomes empty (except for their tail at (4, 0) moving to (5, 0)).\n- Actually, Snake 0's body is [(4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)]. \n- If Snake 0 moves, (4, 0) becomes the new neck, and (5, 0) becomes part of the body.\n- No, if Snake 0 moves from (5, 0) to (5, 1), the head is at (5, 1) and the body is [(5, 0), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3)].\n- Therefore, moving LEFT to (5, 0) results in hitting Snake 0's head/body.\n\nWait, I must check the board again. Head is at (6, 0). \nMy body: (7, 0), (7, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4).\nThere are no empty adjacent squares.\nWait\u2014Snake #1's Tail is at (6, 4). My body is length 7. \nIs there any move? \nLEFT to (5, 0). Snake 0 is at (5, 0). If Snake 0 moves to (6, 0), we collide. If Snake 0 moves to (5, 1), I hit its body at (5, 0).\n\nThe only chance of survival is if Snake 0 moves and leaves (5, 0) vacant, but the head moving out makes that spot the new body segment. The only way (5, 0) is safe is if Snake 0 dies or that was its tail (it isn't).\n\nHowever, I have no other choice. Every other direction is immediate suicide. I will move LEFT and hope for a logic miracle or a head-on collision to tie.\n\nLEFT",
