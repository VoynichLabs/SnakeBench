Moving up therefore carries a non\u2011trivial risk.\n* **RIGHT \u2192 (9,5)** \u2013 Also adjacent to the opponent\u2019s head; the opponent could move down into (9,5) and we would clash. Same risk as moving up.\n* **LEFT \u2192 (7,5)** \u2013 No immediate collision risk; the opponent cannot reach (7,5) in a single step. However this move does not bring us any closer to an apple and leaves us farther from the nearest food source.\n* **DOWN \u2192 (8,4)** \u2013 No snake can reach (8,4) in one move (the opponent would need to move left\u202f+\u202fdown). It moves us directly toward the nearest apple at (8,2) and keeps the board open for future moves.\n\nGiven that safety is the top priority, the only direction that is both safe and progress\u2011toward an apple is **DOWN**. It keeps my options open (I can later move left, right, or up) while steadily approaching food.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan:**  \n1. Move down to (8,4) \u2013 safe and closer to the apple at (8,2).  \n2. Next turn, continue down to (8,3) if still safe, then to (8,2) to eat the apple and grow.  \n3.
