Possible moves: UP (4, 9), DOWN (4, 7), LEFT (3, 8), RIGHT (5, 8).  \nMy possible moves:  \n\nIf I go UP to (1, 2), enemy can't reach me in one move (distance > 1).  \nIf I go DOWN to (1, 0), same.  \nLEFT to (0, 1), same.  \nRIGHT to (2, 1), same.  \n\nNo possible head-on collision this turn because Manhattan distance between heads is |1-4|+|1-8| = 3+7=10, so we can't meet in one move.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Apple proximity and future options**  \n\nClosest apples to me (1, 1):  \n- (3, 0): distance |3-1|+|0-1| = 2+1=3  \n- (2, 6): distance |2-1|+|6-1| = 1+5=6  \n- (0, 7): far  \n- (3, 9): far  \n- (9, 3): far  \n\n(3, 0) is closest.

That's 3 options.  \nFrom (2, 1): possible moves next turn: UP (2,2), DOWN (2,0), LEFT (1,1), RIGHT (3,1). That's 4 options.  \n\nSo RIGHT gives more future mobility.  \n\nAlso, RIGHT moves toward center slightly, which is generally safer.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan note**  \n\nPlan: Go toward (3, 0) apple via RIGHT then DOWN next, but stay flexible. Avoid moving toward enemy until longer. Keep space open.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nRIGHT",

Next moves from (3,0): UP (back to 3,1 \u2013 but that\u2019s my tail next turn, so safe), LEFT (2,0), RIGHT (4,0) \u2013 3 options.  \n- RIGHT to (4, 1): next moves: UP (4,2), DOWN (4,0), LEFT (3,1), RIGHT (5,1) \u2013 4 options.  \n- LEFT to (2, 1): next moves: UP (2,2), DOWN (2,0), LEFT (1,1), RIGHT (3,1) \u2013 4 options.  \n- UP to (3, 2): next moves: UP (3,3), DOWN (3,1), LEFT (2,2), RIGHT (4,2) \u2013 4 options.  \n\nDOWN gives fewer options next turn but gets an apple now.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Consider enemy movement:**  \nEnemy at (3,9) with body at (4,9). It could move DOWN to (3,8), LEFT to (2,9), or RIGHT to (4,9) but that\u2019s its body so not allowed unless it grows into it? Wait, moving into own body kills it unless it grows into that cell this turn. It has 1 apple, so length 3? Let\u2019s check: Snake #0 apples: 1, so it ate 1 apple. Starting length unknown, but likely length = 2 + apples eaten = 3? Actually, if it started length 2 and ate 1 apple, current length = 3. Head (3,9), body [(4,9)], plus one more segment? But board shows only head and one body segment at (4,9). Possibly it grew last turn, so tail hasn\u2019t moved yet? Anyway, enemy is far away, not an immediate threat.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nGetting an apple early is good for score and growth, but growing reduces mobility slightly. However, apple at (3,0) is safe to take now. If I go DOWN, I eat apple, grow to length 2, and next turn I\u2019ll have tail at (3,1) so moving back UP is safe.  \n\nLong-term plan: After eating (3,0), consider moving toward (2,6) or (0,7) while avoiding top area where enemy is. Keep space open, maybe go left toward (2,6) after eating.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nDOWN",

Wait, I ate an apple last turn (DOWN to (3,0) ate apple at (3,0)), so I grew this turn. My length was 2 (head at (3,0), body at (3,1)). After moving this turn, my tail will move only if I don\u2019t eat an apple. Since I already ate last turn, this turn I move without eating (unless I land on another apple), so my tail moves forward: old tail at (3,1) will disappear, new tail will be the second-to-last segment. Let\u2019s check:  \nCurrent body: [(3, 1)] (only one segment after head). After moving without eating: head moves to new cell, body becomes [old head, old body\u2026 but old body is just (3,1), so new body is [(3,0)]? Wait, careful:  \nStart of turn: head (3,0), body [(3,1)] (length 2 total).  \nIf I move UP to (3,1): that\u2019s currently my body segment. Moving into your own body kills you unless you grow into it. Since I am not eating an apple this turn (no apple at (3,1)), moving UP into (3,1) would be moving into my own body without growing \u2192 death. So UP is unsafe.  \n\nLet\u2019s check each direction from (3,0):  \n- UP (3,1): my own body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (3,-1): off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (2,0): empty (board shows '.' at (2,0)) \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT (4,0): empty \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo only LEFT and RIGHT are safe from immediate death.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Check for possible head-on collision with enemy snake #0 (head at (2,9), body at (3,9)):**  \nEnemy head at (2,9). Manhattan distance to my head (3,0) = |3-2| + |0-9| = 1+9=10. No possible head-on collision in one move.  \nBut enemy could move into cells I might move into? Unlikely given distance.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nApples: (0,7), (9,3), (2,6), (5,9), (9,4).  \nClosest to (3,0) by Manhattan:  \n- (2,6): distance |3-2|+|0-6|=1+6=7  \n- (0,7): 3+7=10  \n- (9,3): 6+3=9  \n- (5,9): 2+9=11  \n- (9,4): 6+4=10  \n\nClosest is (2,6) (distance 7). LEFT moves me toward it (x decreases), RIGHT moves away.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each candidate:**  \nFrom (2,0) if LEFT: possible next moves: UP (2,1), RIGHT (3,0) (my old head position, but after moving, that will be my body segment? Let\u2019s simulate:  \nIf I move LEFT to (2,0) without eating apple: new head (2,0), body becomes [(3,0)] (old head). Next turn from (2,0):  \n- UP (2,1): empty now, safe.  \n- DOWN (2,-1): off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (1,0): empty.  \n- RIGHT (3,0): my body (segment from this turn) \u2192 unsafe unless I eat an apple there (none).  \nSo from (2,0) next turn, safe moves: UP, LEFT \u2192 2 options.  \n\nFrom (4,0) if RIGHT: new head (4,0), body [(3,0)]. Next turn from (4,0):  \n- UP (4,1): empty.  \n- DOWN (4,-1): off board.  \n- LEFT (3,0): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (5,0): empty.  \nSo safe: UP, RIGHT \u2192 2 options.  \n\nBoth give 2 safe moves next turn.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Consider enemy movement and long-term:**  \nEnemy is far away in top rows. I want to move toward apples while keeping space. (2,6) is closest apple. LEFT gets me closer to it and also toward (0,7). Going left also keeps me away from enemy\u2019s area (top right).  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT is safe, moves toward nearest apple, and maintains same future mobility as RIGHT. Prefer LEFT to start heading toward (2,6).\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter moving to (2,0), aim to go UP toward (2,6) while checking safety. Avoid trapping myself in left column; maybe go UP next if safe, then continue upward toward apple. Keep an eye on enemy from a distance.\n\nLEFT",

Wait, (2,7) to (2,6) is DOWN 1 step, not 5. Yes, so next turn enemy could be at (2,6) if it chooses DOWN.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity and risk of head-on collision**  \nClosest apple to me is (2, 6) at distance |2-2| + |1-6| = 5.  \nGoing UP reduces distance to 4.  \nBut enemy might also go DOWN toward (2, 6) this turn. If enemy goes DOWN, it will be at (2, 6) next turn, and I would be at (2, 2) if I go UP. That\u2019s safe vertical separation.  \n\nHowever, if I go UP multiple turns toward (2, 6), eventually we could meet. But for now, no immediate collision risk because enemy is far above.  \n\nCheck LEFT: (1, 1) \u2192 closest apple then is (0, 7) or (2, 6) \u2192 distances increase.  \nRIGHT: (3, 1) \u2192 similar.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility**  \nFrom (2, 2) after UP:  \n- UP (2, 3): '.'  \n- DOWN (2, 1): my body after move (old head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (1, 2): '.'  \n- RIGHT (3, 2): '.'  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nFrom (1, 1) after LEFT:  \n- UP (1, 2): '.'  \n- DOWN (1, 0): '.' (currently empty, but after my move, my tail at (2,0) stays, so (1,0) free)  \n- LEFT (0, 1): '.'  \n- RIGHT (2, 1): my body after move \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn too.  \n\nFrom (3, 1) after RIGHT:  \n- UP (3, 2): '.'  \n- DOWN (3, 0): '.'  \n- LEFT (2, 1): my body after move \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (4, 1): '.'  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nAll three safe moves give same immediate future mobility.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nI want to avoid boxing myself in left column if possible. Going UP keeps me central and moving toward apple (2, 6). Enemy might eat (2, 6) before I get there, but there are other apples.  \nAlso, enemy is length 2 like me, so no huge danger yet.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Check for possible same-cell collision this turn**  \nEnemy at (2, 7) cannot reach any of my possible next positions (2, 2), (1, 1), (3, 1) in one move, so no head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP moves toward closest apple, keeps central position, and is safe.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nContinue moving UP toward (2, 6) but watch enemy movement. If enemy moves DOWN toward that apple, consider veering LEFT or RIGHT to avoid direct vertical chase, maybe target (0, 7) or (5, 9) instead. Keep space around head.  \n\nUP",

(currently empty)  \n- LEFT (0, 2): '.'  \n- RIGHT (2, 2): my old head \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nAfter RIGHT to (3, 2):  \n- UP (3, 3): '.'  \n- DOWN (3, 1): '.'  \n- LEFT (2, 2): my old head \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (4, 2): '.'  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nAll three give same immediate future mobility.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term positioning**  \nGoing UP keeps me more central. Going LEFT moves me toward left wall, which could limit future options if I get trapped near column 0.  \nEnemy is above at (2, 6), moving toward it vertically might lead to conflict later, but for now safe.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Danger from enemy\u2019s possible moves**  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (2, 5), then next turn it could be at (2, 4) if it continues DOWN, and I could be at (2, 4) if I go UP twice \u2014 that\u2019s a possible head-on collision in 2 turns. But I can adjust later.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP seems best: closer to apple (0, 6) via a more central path, avoids left wall early, safe this turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMonitor enemy movement. If enemy moves DOWN toward (2, 5), consider veering LEFT or RIGHT next turn to avoid meeting head-on. Target apple (0, 6) or (0, 7) while keeping space.  \n\nUP",

So UP is risky.  \nIf I go LEFT to (6, 7) and enemy goes DOWN to (6, 7) \u2192 same cell \u2192 both die.

Let\u2019s check: enemy\u2019s possible positions after this turn: (7, 8) if DOWN, (8, 9) if RIGHT. So (7, 9) will be empty unless enemy stays (impossible because enemy must move). But (7, 9) will be empty.  \nActually, wait: enemy body after move: if enemy goes DOWN to (7, 8), its new body starts (7, 9) (old head) then (6, 9), etc. So (7, 9) becomes its body segment. So (7, 9) is unsafe for me next turn.  \nLet\u2019s evaluate all from (7, 8) next turn:  \n- UP (7, 9): enemy body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN (7, 7): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT (6, 8): enemy body \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT (8, 8): my old head (now body) \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo from (7, 8) next turn, all 4 moves unsafe!

Both have collision risk, but RIGHT also keeps pressure toward the right-side apples (9,4) and (9,3), which are relatively closer.\n- Rationale: Moving RIGHT advances toward the right-side apples and maintains open space above, while DOWN would dig toward the lower-right quadrant but invites a potential direct collision with the enemy if they choose LEFT. Since objective is to secure more apples while staying alive, RIGHT offers a stronger chance to contest the right-side apples without immediately boxing me in.\n- Short-term plan: Play aggressively to the right this turn to edge toward the right-side apples; reassess next turn based on enemy movement and available safe follow-ups.\n\nRIGHT",
