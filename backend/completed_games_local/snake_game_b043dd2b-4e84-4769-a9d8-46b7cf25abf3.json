Closes distance to (7, 2).\n\nAnalysis:\nApple at (7, 2) is the most logical immediate target. From (5, 1), the shortest path is 3 steps (e.g., RIGHT, RIGHT, UP or RIGHT, UP, RIGHT).\nApple at (8, 5) is also a possibility, but Snake #0 is currently at (8, 6), only 1 step away from it. Snake #0 will likely take (8, 5) or (6, 7) immediately.\nMy goal is to secure (7, 2) before Snake #0 can descend to it. Snake #0 is at y=6, apple is at y=2 (distance 4). I am at y=1, apple is at y=2 (distance 3). I have a slight advantage if I move towards it now.\n\nPlan:\nMove RIGHT to (6, 1) to position myself directly under the x-coordinate of the apple or close to it, then move towards (7, 2). I must watch out for Snake #0 moving down the 7th or 8th column.\n\nRIGHT",

From (5,1), they can move:\n- UP (5,2): Safe\n- DOWN (5,0): Safe\n- LEFT (4,1): **DEADLY** - would hit their own body\n- RIGHT (6,1): Safe\n\nThey cannot move LEFT, so they're forced to move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. They cannot eat the apple at (7,2) this turn since they're at (5,1) - 2 moves away horizontally and 1 move away vertically. They cannot eat the apple at (4,6) this turn - 5 moves away vertically.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- DOWN move gives me an immediate apple, bringing me to 4 apples (one away from winning)\n- LEFT and RIGHT moves don't give me an apple this turn\n- DOWN move positions me well for future turns toward the apple at (7,2)\n- RIGHT move brings me to the right boundary, which definitely limits future options\n- LEFT move keeps me away from boundaries and opens paths toward apples at (6,7) and (8,5)\n\n**Comparing DOWN vs LEFT:**\nDOWN gives me an immediate apple and brings me to 4 apples total. This is very close to winning (50 apples needed). LEFT doesn't give me an apple this turn. Given that I'm already at 3 apples and winning the game is the primary goal, getting the immediate apple with DOWN is clearly superior.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:**\nIf I move DOWN to (8,5) and eat the apple, I'll have 4 apples total. On my next turn, I'll be positioned to potentially eat the apple at (7,2) if I can reach it, or continue toward other apples. I need to be careful about my tail position after growing.\n\nDOWN",

Both UP and RIGHT bring me to a distance of 1 from it. However, moving UP to (1, 2) allows for a more direct path to (2, 2) while keeping me more central and away from the snake body currently at (2, 0) and (3, 0). Snake #0 is currently far away at the top of the board and shouldn't interfere with the immediate collection of the apple at (2, 2). After (2, 2), I will target the apples at (5, 3) or (9, 1).\n\nPlan:\nMove UP to (1, 2) to prepare for taking the apple at (2, 2). Next move will likely be RIGHT to (2, 2).\n\nUP",
