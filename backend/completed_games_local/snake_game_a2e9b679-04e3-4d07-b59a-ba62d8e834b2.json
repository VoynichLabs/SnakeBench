The bottom apples are closer and should be prioritized. Once I collect one or two there, reassess whether to chase upper apples or continue optimizing the bottom row.\n\nDOWN",

More follow-up options reduce risk of getting boxed in.\n\nGoal alignment:\n- Apples are mostly below us (y=6 and y=0).

These apples are on my horizontal level (y=1) and relatively close. The path appears clear and direct.\n\n- **UP to (1, 2)**: This moves away from the nearby apples at (5, 0) and (7, 1). It doesn't seem to offer a strategic advantage since I'd have to loop back around.\n\nThe enemy snake is positioned far away at (3, 6), so there's no immediate collision threat. Moving RIGHT continues my established strategy of collecting apples along the lower portion of the board while staying away from the enemy.\n\nThe apples at (5, 0) and (7, 1) are clearly reachable by continuing RIGHT. This move keeps me on track and maximizes my ability to collect points.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Continue moving RIGHT along row 1 to reach apple at (7, 1), then pivot to collect (5, 0). The enemy is sufficiently far away that I can pursue these apples safely. After collecting these, reassess the board state and move toward remaining apples while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nRIGHT",

Reasonable but less progressive.\n- DOWN (3,5): moves toward bottom region where the opponent is closer to some apples (e.g., (0,5), (7,1)); could invite competition and reduce options.\n- UP (3,7): maintains multiple escape options (can go up, left, or right next turn), and starts a direct path toward the apple at (4,9) and also helps later reach the row-6 apple at (9,6) by moving around my body-block at x=5.

Not productive.\n\nThe enemy snake at (4, 8) is 7 cells directly above me on column 4. If it continues moving down it could eventually threaten this column, but that's several turns away.

This is a critical opportunity. If I move UP, I can position myself to collect apples in a vertical line: (4, 5) then (4, 6) then (4, 8).\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\n- Enemy head is at (9, 6).

Now I need to plan my next moves carefully:\n\n- **UP to (4, 9)**: Takes me to the top row. From there, I'd be at the top edge with limited escape routes if I go further.\n- **LEFT to (3, 8)**: Moves me toward the left side of the board where there's a cluster of apples at (0, 5), (0, 2), (0, 9).\n- **RIGHT to (5, 8)**: Moves me away from apple clusters.\n\nThe apples at x=0 form a vertical line (0, 9), (0, 5), (0, 2). Going LEFT now allows me to work toward this cluster efficiently. My previous rationale was to target these left-side apples after consuming the (4, 8) apple, which I've now done.\n\nThe enemy is still at (6, 5) with 8 apples (same as me), so I'm in a competitive tie. I need to collect more apples quickly to get ahead.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**\n- Turn 33 (now): Move LEFT to (3, 8)\n- Turn 34: Continue LEFT toward the apple cluster at x=0\n- Target apples in order: (0, 9) first (closest when moving left), then (0, 5), then (0, 2)\n- Be cautious of the enemy snake - monitor its position to avoid head-on collisions\n- Once I secure 2-3 more apples, I'll have a 10-11 apple lead\n\nLEFT",

Preserving space and options is priority.\n\nShort plan: keep moving up/around the top to gain room (avoid being funneled into x=4).

It moves toward the left apples but approaching the enemy column at x=4 (they occupy (4,2)..(4,8)) so I'd get funneled unless I first get above that column.\n- RIGHT -> (7,7) is free. It\u2019s safe but moves away from the apples and doesn\u2019t improve my route to the left side.\n- UP -> (6,8) is free and gives the most options. From (6,8) I can go to (6,9) next turn to get above the enemy column and then swing left along the top row to reach (2,9) and (0,9) while avoiding their x=4 vertical body.\n\nEnemy considerations:\n- Enemy head is at (3,9) with neck at (3,8) so their illegal move includes DOWN. They are very likely to move LEFT to (2,9) to take that top apple, then continue left toward (0,9). That means I must get above the enemy column quickly to contest the top apples or switch to left-column apples at x=0 later.\n- Moving UP now keeps distance, gets me above more of the enemy body next turn, and preserves multiple follow-up moves (LEFT, RIGHT, UP from (6,8)).\n\nShort-term plan for next turns:\n- Take UP now to (6,8). Next turn move UP to (6,9) to get above the enemy column, then head left along y=9 to contest top apples. If the enemy clearly secures both top apples, pivot down-left later toward the apples on x=0 or x=2.\n\nUP",

The good news is that moving DOWN to (0, 8) keeps me moving toward the apple cluster on the left side of the board:\n- Apple at (0, 5) is directly below me - accessible by continuing DOWN\n- Apple at (0, 2) is further down\n- This maintains my position in the scoring lead (10-9)\n\nThe tight space near my head is a result of my snake's recent growth. I need to navigate carefully while the enemy snake at (8, 8) is relatively far away.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. Turn 38 (now): Move DOWN to (0, 8)\n2. Turn 39: Move DOWN to (0, 7)\n3. Turn 40: Move DOWN to (0, 6)\n4. Turn 41: Move DOWN to (0, 5) - collect apple (score: 11)\n5.

Both UP then RIGHT and RIGHT then UP reach it in two moves. The enemy head at (0,9) is far away and cannot contest (9,9) this turn.\n- RIGHT -> (9,8) gives two safe, non-backwards follow-ups (UP to apple or DOWN to open space). It keeps more forward momentum toward the apple without moving to the top edge yet, which preserves mobility.\n- UP -> (8,9) would also let me get the apple next turn, but that puts me on the top row (y=9) where UP is off-board \u2014 reducing one immediate direction. RIGHT maintains slightly better flexibility.\n- DOWN -> (8,7) is safe but moves away from the immediate chance to tie the score by taking (9,9) next turn.\n\nShort plan (for next turns):\n- Take (9,9) as soon as possible to tie apples (10).\n- After grabbing (9,9), avoid getting boxed into the top-right corner: prefer moving left or down after eating to keep escape routes open.\n- Then sweep back toward the cluster of apples near x<=5 while steering clear of the enemy's x=4 column which creates choke points.\n\nMove: RIGHT",

That would net two apples in two subsequent turns, likely before the enemy from (3,2) can contest (it needs more turns to reach row 6).\n\nShort-term plan (for next turns):\n- Move LEFT now to approach the (4,6)/(3,6) apples.\n- Next turn go UP to eat (4,6), then LEFT to take (3,6) if still available.\n- After that, re-evaluate: either continue collecting nearby apples (8,6 or 9,3) or head for (5,2) depending on opponent movement and space.

Currently, my snake is stretched vertically on the left side of the board, and I'm positioned at (5, 2) after eating the previous apple.\n\n**Collision Analysis:**\n- Enemy head at (4, 6) will move this turn. Possible moves: UP to (4, 7), DOWN to (4, 5), LEFT to (3, 6), RIGHT to (5, 6). None of these threaten (5, 3), (5, 1), or (6, 2) this turn.\n\n**Best Move:**\nMoving **RIGHT to (6, 2)** keeps me moving in a direction that:\n- Opens up paths toward the (9, 3) apple cluster\n- Keeps me away from the enemy snake's territory\n- Maintains flexibility for the next several moves\n- Continues moving along the bottom portion of the board where I have more maneuvering room\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- Turn 50 (now): RIGHT to (6, 2)\n- Turn 51+: Continue rightward toward (9, 3), then reassess apple positions and enemy locations\n\nRIGHT",

From (4,7) my options next turn would be limited (mainly UP or LEFT).\n- LEFT to (3,6) also eats an apple but preserves more escape options (LEFT to 2,6 then 1,6, UP to 3,7, or DOWN to 3,5). It also puts me on a direct path to the nearby apple at (1,6).\n- Preserving maneuverability is important given my long body curling on the right/top; taking (3,6) gives more future choices and reduces risk of getting boxed in.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns:\n- After LEFT -> (3,6), continue toward (1,6) (take 2,6 then 1,6) while monitoring enemy movement and remaining apples (8,6 and 9,3).\n- Avoid moving into tight spaces near my own body on the top/right unless I have an assured escape.\n\nLEFT",

It opens up the board and reduces the risk of getting trapped at the edge\n3. The enemy snake at (3, 7) is still reasonably far away\n4.

The next apple at (7, 8) is relatively close. However, I need to be careful about the enemy snake's position at (4, 8) - it's getting closer to that area.\n\nThe bottom apples at (6, 0) and (5, 0) are also good targets to keep in mind as backup options.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nCollect the apple at (8, 6) this turn. Then reassess the board and the enemy snake's movements to determine whether to pursue (7, 8) or pivot toward the bottom apples. The key is maintaining flexibility and avoiding getting cornered as we both compete for the remaining apples.\n\nUP",

If I move UP to (8, 7), I can reach (7, 8) next turn if it's still available. However, LEFT to (7, 6) positions me even better to claim (7, 8) next turn.\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. UP to (8, 7) is 1 step away from (7, 8). LEFT to (7, 6) is also 1 step away. Given the enemy's proximity and the value of being first to the (7, 8) apple, I should move toward it aggressively.\n\nMoving UP to (8, 7) keeps me in vertical alignment with both the top apple area and allows flexibility. Moving LEFT to (7, 6) is more direct toward (7, 8).\n\nI'll go LEFT to position myself optimally for the (7, 8) apple next turn while maintaining board flexibility.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nMove LEFT this turn to (7, 6), then move UP next turn to claim the apple at (7, 8). After that, re-evaluate based on remaining apples and enemy position. The bottom apples at (6, 0), (5, 0), and (8, 0) are secondary targets. Watch for the enemy snake trying to cut me off - maintain safe escape routes.\n\nLEFT",

That square is safe this turn, but being on the edge reduces escape options next turn (DOWN would be backwards into my current head, so follow-ups are LEFT or RIGHT). RIGHT would push me toward my dense body on the right side; LEFT keeps options but still hugs the edge.\n- LEFT to (2,8) moves me away from my crowded right-side body into more open space. From (2,8) I retain at least two non-backwards follow-ups (UP to 2,9 or LEFT to 1,8), which preserves more maneuvering room and a path toward the lower-left apple cluster (e.g., (1,4)) if it becomes safe.\n\nEnemy heads are distant (snake #0 head at 8,6), so no immediate head-on threat on either candidate square.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Move left/top to keep space and avoid getting boxed by my own body.\n- Re-evaluate next turn for a safe route toward reachable apples (prefer the left-side apple at (1,4) if uncontested), otherwise circle the top/left area to maintain space and wait for opponent to commit.\n\nLEFT",

The remaining apples are clustered at the bottom: (6, 0), (5, 0), and (8, 0). I should work toward that cluster after confirming it's safe.

My snake is currently quite long (18 segments) and positioned at (7, 8).\n\n**LEFT to (6, 8):** This moves me toward the center-left and keeps me positioned above my body. I can then move down along column 6 to reach apples at (6, 0) and (5, 0). This seems like a natural progression toward valuable apples.\n\n**RIGHT to (8, 8):** This keeps me on the right side where apple (8, 0) is located. This is also a viable path.\n\n**UP to (7, 9):** This pushes me to the top edge. While safe now, it limits my downward mobility and doesn't help me reach apples.\n\nThe enemy snake at (1, 9) is in the top-left corner. Moving UP would bring me closer to potential collision with them if they move right, though they're still 6 cells away.\n\n**Optimal Decision:**\nLEFT to (6, 8) is the best move because:\n- It safely moves me away from my own body\n- It positions me to navigate down the left-center area toward the apple cluster at (6, 0) and (5, 0)\n- It keeps me away from the enemy snake at (1, 9)\n- It maintains flexibility for the next several moves\n\n**Next Turn Plan:**\nContinue moving left and then down to collect the apples at the bottom of the board. The enemy is far away (head at 1, 9) so I have space to work with. Focus on collecting apples efficiently to reach 50 before the enemy catches up.\n\nLEFT",

That funnels me immediately.\n- LEFT to (0,9) is legal; from there the only non-backwards move is DOWN -> (0,8). Both routes lead quickly to (0,8), but staying on the top row a bit longer (LEFT) keeps me away from the congested interior (columns 2\u20135) and preserves predictable movement.\n\nOpponent threat:\n- Enemy head at (7,8) is far; no plausible head-on contest for the squares I'm targeting this turn.\n\nLong-term plan:\n- Move to (0,9) then down the left edge toward row 4; approach the (1,4) apple later from the left once my mid-body segments (like (1,7)) have time to clear.

My body is still trailing. Let me check - (7, 8) is now my second body segment \u2717 DEATH\n\n**Valid moves:** UP, LEFT, or DOWN\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nLooking at my position, I'm at (6, 8) directly above the apple at (6, 0). This is an excellent position!\n\n- **DOWN to (6, 7)**: This moves me closer to the apple cluster. I can continue down column 6 to reach (6, 0) in 7 more moves. This is a direct path to an apple.\n\n- **LEFT to (5, 8)**: This moves toward the center-left but takes me away from the (6, 0) apple that's directly below me.\n\n- **UP to (6, 9)**: This moves me to the edge away from apples. Inefficient.\n\nThe enemy snake is now at (0, 9) after their move. They're still on the left side of the board, not an immediate threat.\n\n**Optimal Decision:**\nDOWN to (6, 7) is the best move because:\n- It directly moves me toward the apple at (6, 0) which is 7 cells directly below\n- It's a safe path with no obstacles in the way\n- My body is trailing to the left, so moving down keeps me clear of it\n- This maximizes my apple collection rate\n\n**Next Turn Plan:**\nContinue moving DOWN through column 6 to collect the apple at (6, 0). Once I collect it, reassess and move toward the next closest apple cluster at (5, 0) and then potentially (8, 0) or (9, 1).\n\nDOWN",

(0,8) is currently empty and gives me follow-up options down the left edge; it avoids the congested center/right where the enemy occupies many cells. Long-term plan: continue down the left column toward y=4, then approach the apple at (1,4) once my internal body clears to avoid colliding with my mid-body. Avoid cutting into the crowded middle and watch enemy head movements for any attempts to contest the left side.\n\nDOWN",

This was my previous head position (where I came from). My body currently has [(6, 7), (6, 8), ...]. Position (6, 7) is my first body segment. \u2717 DEATH (moving backwards into own body)\n\n2. **DOWN to (6, 5)**: On board.

Position (7, 6) is my fifth body segment. \u2717 DEATH\n\n**Valid moves:** DOWN or LEFT\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nI've been pursuing the apple at (6, 0), which is directly below my current position. Moving DOWN continues this efficient path toward that apple (4 more moves away).\n\nMoving LEFT to (5, 6) would:\n- Move me away from the (6, 0) apple\n- Navigate toward other apples like (5, 0) eventually\n- Keep me in the mid-board area\n\nThe DOWN move maintains my momentum toward (6, 0), which is the closest apple I've been targeting. The path below appears clear, and I haven't occupied (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1) positions - wait, let me check: my body goes (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 7), (7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2)... \n\nI have (6, 2) in my body! So moving DOWN repeatedly won't work forever - I'll hit (6, 2) eventually. But for this turn, (6, 5) is clear.\n\nHowever, LEFT to (5, 6) gives me more flexibility. From (5, 6), I could move to approach (5, 0) or navigate toward other apples. This keeps my options open longer.\n\nActually, reconsidering: DOWN to (6, 5) is safe this turn and keeps me on track for (6, 0). Once I collect (6, 0), I'll naturally pivot to other apples. The risk of hitting my own body segment at (6, 2) is manageable since that's 4 moves away, giving me time to adjust course before then.\n\n**Decision:**\nDOWN is the best move - continues my efficient path toward the (6, 0) apple while remaining safe.\n\n**Next Turn Plan:**\nAfter eating (6, 0), I should move to collect (5, 0) next, which will free up my tail and give me more board flexibility for the remaining turns.\n\nDOWN",

My body extends from (6, 6) down through several segments, with (6, 2) being a critical checkpoint. Moving DOWN toward (6, 0) is still viable since (6, 4) is clear.\n\n**Path to (6, 0):**\n- Current position: (6, 5)\n- DOWN to (6, 4) - safe\n- DOWN to (6, 3) - safe (not occupied)\n- DOWN to (6, 2) - BLOCKED! This is my body segment.\n\nWait, I need to reconsider. My body segment is at (6, 2), so continuing straight DOWN will trap me. I have only 3 turns before hitting my own body at (6, 2).\n\n**Better approach:** Move RIGHT to (7, 5) to navigate around my body and maintain flexibility. From (7, 5), I can:\n- Move DOWN toward the apple cluster at (8, 0), (9, 1)\n- Or adjust as needed based on enemy movement\n\nRIGHT keeps my options open while avoiding an immediate dead-end collision with my own body.\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turns:**\nMy snake's current configuration forces me to navigate carefully. The apples at (6, 0) and (5, 0) are slightly blocked by my own body. Focus on the right-side apples (8, 0), (9, 1) which are more accessible. After 84 apples total needed (50 target), I'm at 17, so I need 33 more apples from 84 remaining turns - about 0.39 apples/turn.

No enemy head can reach (1,5) or (0,4) this turn, so both safe moves avoid immediate head-on risk.\n\nChoice:\n- Both RIGHT and DOWN are safe and both lead toward the nearby apple at (1,4) in one more move.\n- I prefer DOWN to continue using the left column to create space, wait for my tail to clear blocking segments, and then step into (1,4) next turn to take the apple.

Avoiding risky direct contest for the (6,4) apple is prudent since they are closer and very likely to secure it.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move DOWN to retain maneuverability and avoid getting boxed against my own body or into Snake #0's area.\n- From there, evaluate paths toward bottom apples (5,0 / 6,0 / 8,0 / 9,1) or look for safe opportunities to circle back if Snake #0 commits elsewhere.\n\nMove:\nDOWN",

This is strategically good since I have multiple apples within reach. From (5, 3), I can continue down to (5, 2), then (5, 1), then (5, 0) to collect the apple.\n\n- **UP to (5, 5):** This moves me upward into the middle of the board.

It's safe (no collisions)\n2. It directly moves me toward the concentrated apple cluster at y=0-1\n3. It keeps future options open (can continue down or move left/right at any time)\n4. Enemy snake #1 at (1, 1) is far away and not an immediate threat\n5. This positions me to collect multiple apples in the next few turns\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nContinue DOWN toward the apple cluster.

Enemy snake #1 head is at (2, 3), which won't interfere\n\n- **LEFT to (4, 1)**: Moves away from the apple cluster, less efficient.\n\n- **RIGHT to (6, 1)**: Also moves toward apples, but DOWN is more direct for the (5, 0) apple.\n\n**Strategy Notes for Future Turns:**\nAfter collecting (5, 0), continue executing the bottom-row apple collection: move to (6, 0), then towards (8, 0). Watch for any counter-movements from enemy snake #1. The apple at (9, 1) is also nearby and valuable. Priority: maintain apple lead while staying away from enemy snake's body.\n\nDOWN",

Moving to (6, 1) is safe - wait, let me verify. My body goes (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2)... so (6, 1) is clear. Safe! \u2713\n\n2. **DOWN to (6, -1)**: Off the board - DEATH \u2717\n\n3. **LEFT to (5, 0)**: My body - DEATH \u2717\n\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 0)**: Safe, moves toward apple at (8, 0) \u2713\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n\nThe best move is **RIGHT** because:\n- It continues my bottom-row apple collection strategy\n- (8, 0) is only 2 cells away now\n- After (8, 0), I can grab (9, 1) \n- This extends my apple lead significantly\n- Enemy snake #1 is far away (head at (2, 5)), no immediate collision threat\n- UP would move me back toward my own body and away from the immediate apple cluster\n\nThe bottom-row strategy remains optimal. I'm positioned perfectly to grab the cluster at (8, 0) \u2192 (9, 1) which will increase my apple lead.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Continue RIGHT to secure (8, 0), then maneuver to (9, 1), building an insurmountable lead before the final turns.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy #0's head is at (6,0), far away; its body cluster occupies the central/right area around (5,4)-(8,6).\n- The central apple (5,5) is 3 steps away from me and is the highest-value short-term target. Moving RIGHT gets me closest to that apple fastest (in two moves: (3,5)->(4,5)->(5,5)).\n- UP is a safe, conservative option that preserves space but delays reaching (5,5). LEFT heads toward the (1,8) apple which is safe and uncontested but is one step longer to reach than going right to the center apple.\n- Moving RIGHT does edge me toward the enemy's body cluster, but the enemy head is not an immediate threat to the apple this turn. I should watch for the enemy committing upward; if they contest the center apple aggressively, I should pivot to (1,8) or a safer apple.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move RIGHT to close the gap to (5,5). If the enemy commits to contesting the center apple (moving heads toward x\u22485,y\u22485), avoid head-to-head and reroute to (1,8) or one of the bottom apples if they become safe.\n- Preserve escape options by not entering tight corridors adjacent to my own long body; prefer routes that keep 2+ follow-up moves open.\n\nRIGHT",

LEFT (8, 1) moves me directly toward the nearest apple at (7, 2), which is just 1 cell left and 1 cell up from there. This is the more efficient path to grab the next apple.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (8, 1), I'll be well-positioned to grab the apple at (7, 2) by moving UP then LEFT. After that, assess whether to go for the apples at (3, 0) and (4, 0) on the bottom row, or pursue other opportunities. Keep monitoring enemy snake #1's position to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nLEFT",

From (5,7) valid follow-ups: UP or LEFT (RIGHT is blocked by enemy body at 6,7, DOWN is the neck). That preserves two escape options and moves me closer to a reachable apple.\n- LEFT (4,6) is also safe this turn and has exits to (4,7) and (3,6), but DOWN from there is blocked by my own body at (4,5), reducing safe continuations in that direction.\n- The enemy cluster is mostly to my east; moving UP keeps me further from that dense area while heading toward the high-value apple at (1,8).\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Move north to reach the (1,8) apple via the upper corridor, maintaining at least two escape options each turn.\n- Avoid drifting into the tight enemy cluster on the right; if the path to (1,8) becomes blocked, pivot left along open spaces and use my long tail corridor to circle safely.\n\nUP",

It keeps two good follow-ups (UP to 5,9 or LEFT toward 4,8\u21923,8\u21922,8\u21921,8) and moves me onto the same row as the nearby apple at (1,8). Enemy head is far away (8,1), and enemy bodies at (6,8)/(7,8) are to the right, so no immediate head-on risk.\n- LEFT (4,7) is safe this turn but funnels me slightly toward my own body at (4,5) if I try to go downward later, reducing escape options.\n- RIGHT and DOWN are immediate death.\n\nShort plan:\n- Move UP now to (5,8), then head left along y=8 to collect (1,8). Maintain at least two exit options each turn to avoid getting boxed by enemy body clusters on the east side. After securing the (1,8) apple, reassess for the top apple at (4,9) or pivot to lower apples if the east cluster closes routes.\n\nUP",

This puts me further ahead of the enemy snake (which still has 18).\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nAfter eating at (7, 2), I'll reassess. The next closest apples are at (3, 0) and (4, 0) on the bottom row. I should navigate there while being mindful of the enemy snake's position.

It positions me to hunt the nearby apples at (3, 0) and (4, 0) next turn, maintaining my lead over the enemy snake.\n\n**Plan for next 2-3 turns:**\nFrom (6, 0), I can move LEFT toward (3, 0) or (4, 0) to secure another apple. The enemy is positioned far away on the left side of the board, so there's minimal collision risk. After grabbing one of these nearby apples, I should reassess and hunt the remaining closer apples before considering the more distant ones.\n\nDOWN",
