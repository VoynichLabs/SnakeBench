Immediate death.\n- DOWN: Moves to (0, 2). This is safe. It moves further away from the enemy and the cluster of apples, but maintains life.\n- RIGHT: Moves to (1, 3). This is my own body segment (the neck). Immediate death.\n- UP: Moves to (0, 4). This is a head-on collision with Snake 0 if Snake 0 stays at (0, 4). However, Snake 0 must move. If Snake 0 moves to (0, 5) (towards the apple), I would be moving into its previous position, which is safe from collision *unless* it moves back to (0, 3) (which it cannot do as that's my head's current position). **Wait**, if Snake 0 moves to (1, 4) or stays on the 0-x axis, and I move UP, I risk a head-on collision at (0, 4) or (0, 5). More importantly, if Snake 0 moves DOWN to (0, 3), and I move UP to (0, 4), we swap, but if it moves to (0, 4) it's already there. \n\nActually, look at the Board State:\nSnake 0 is at (0, 4). My head is at (0, 3).\nIf I move UP, I move to (0, 4). If Snake 0 moves DOWN, it moves to (0, 3). We are safe.\nHOWEVER, if Snake 0 moves to (0, 5) and I move UP, I am now at (0, 4).\nIf I move UP and Snake 0 moves to (1, 4), I am at (0, 4).\nThe only way I die moving UP is if Snake 0's move results in its head being at (0, 4) at the end of the turn. But Snake 0 is *already* at (0, 4), it must move to a new adjacent cell.\nThe real danger of moving UP: If Snake 0 moves to (0, 5) and I move UP to (0, 4), we are still adjacent. If Snake 0 moves to (1, 4) and I move UP to (0, 4), we are still adjacent.\nMost importantly: (0, 5) is an apple. Snake 0 will likely move UP to (0, 5).\n\nIf I move UP to (0, 4) and Snake 0 moves UP to (0, 5), I am trailing it. This is good for reaching the apples at (0, 5) and (0, 7). \nIf I move DOWN to (0, 2), I am moving away from the apples and the enemy.\n\nStrategic Note:\nMoving UP is the most aggressive and rewarding path to the apples at (0, 5) and (0, 7). Since Snake 0 must vacate (0, 4), UP is safe from immediate collision. I will follow Snake 0 and look for an opening to take the higher apples or wait for it to move right.\n\nUP",

It is very close to the apple at (0, 3). If I move LEFT to (4, 2), and it moves RIGHT to (2, 3), we are narrowing the gap significantly. Snake 0 is also somewhat restricted by its own body and the board edge.\n- **Targeting Apples:** The closest apples are (0, 3), (9, 5), (7, 8), and (0, 8). (0, 3) is contested by Snake 0. (9, 5) and (7, 8) are open.\n- **Pathing:** Moving UP to (5, 3) is a flexible move. It allows me to pivot toward (0, 3) if Snake 0 misses it, or move toward the cluster of apples in the upper half of the board ((9, 5), (7, 8), (0, 8), (1, 9)).\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (5, 3). This avoids a potential immediate collision with Snake 0 while I assess its move towards the (0, 3) apple.

It avoids the congestion of the enemy's body and positions you to sweep the apples on the right side of the board.

Safe. Gets you adjacent to two apples: (7, 8) and (6, 8).\n- **DOWN:** Moves to (8, 6). Safe. There are no immediate threats here, but it moves away from the clusters of apples.\n- **LEFT:** Moves to (7, 7). Safe. This is a solid step toward the apples (7, 8) and (6, 8).\n- **RIGHT:** Moves to (9, 7). **Fatal.** This is your neck.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nThe apples at (7, 8) and (6, 8) are very close. Snake #0 is currently at (3, 9). To reach (7, 8), Snake #0 needs 5 moves (4 right, 1 down). You can reach (7, 8) in 2 moves (UP then LEFT, or LEFT then UP). You are in a strong position to secure both neighboring apples. Choosing UP first puts you at (8, 8), directly between the apple at (7, 8) and the edge, which is a safe path.\n\nMoving UP or LEFT is productive. UP puts you closer to the y-coordinate of the apples while keeping you away from your own body at x=9.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (8, 8). From there, move LEFT to (7, 8) to collect the first apple, then likely LEFT again to (6, 8) for the second. This maximizes your lead over Snake #0.\n\nUP",

However, (5, 7) is a potential head-on collision spot if Snake #0 moves RIGHT then UP.\n- If you move DOWN to (6, 6), you are adjacent to (5, 6). \n- Note your body at row $y=4$. Your head is currently at $y=7$. You have a relative \"pocket\" between your head and your body segments at $y=4$.\n- Moving LEFT is the most aggressive play for the apples at (4, 7) and (5, 6). Snake #0 is currently positioned to potentially cut you off or contest these apples.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (5, 7). This positions you to take the apple at (4, 7) or (5, 6).

Safe. It opens up the path towards many lower apples and avoids the current clump of your body.\n3. **LEFT:** Goes to (4, 6). Safe. This puts you near apple (4, 7) and (3, 3).\n4. **RIGHT:** Goes to (6, 6). Safe. This leads into the space between your body segments (row 7 and row 5), which is currently empty.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Snake #0 is at (2, 4). If you move LEFT to (4, 6), you are moving closer to them.\n- Apple (4, 7) is currently \"behind\" your neck segment at (5, 7). To get it, you'd likely need to loop around.\n- The area at (5, 5), (4, 5), (4, 6) is wide open.\n- Moving DOWN to (5, 5) is the most flexible move. It creates distance from your own tail/body coil and positions you to strike for apples at (3, 3) or (4, 1).\n- Snake #0 is currently boxed in slightly by their own body to their right (row 3). Their only immediate exits are (1, 4), (2, 3), or (2, 5).\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (5, 5). This provides a safe buffer from your body and the enemy while positioning you to grab the apples in the bottom-middle of the board.\n\nDOWN",

Moving to (4, 4) puts you adjacent to its possible next positions. \n3. **LEFT:** To (3, 5). **Fatal.** You would hit Snake 0's body at (3, 5).\n4. **RIGHT:** To (5, 5). **Fatal.** This is your own neck.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Your body currently forms a large loop to your right and above you.\n- Snake 0 has blocked off much of the left side (x=0 to x=3).\n- Apple (4, 7) is reachable but requires navigating between your body at (5, 7) and the enemy body at (3, 7).\n- Apple (4, 1) is in the bottom area.\n- Moving UP to (4, 6) is the safest way to maintain space. From (4, 6), you can aim for the apple at (4, 7). Although (4, 7) is flanked by bodies, it is accessible.\n- Moving DOWN to (4, 4) is viable but gets you closer to Snake 0's head.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (4, 6) to keep distance from Snake 0 and prepare to collect the apple at (4, 7). Avoid getting squeezed between your own tail and Snake 0's long vertical section on the 3-column.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n2. **DOWN:** To (4, 6). **Fatal.** This is your own neck.\n3. **LEFT:** To (3, 7). **Fatal.** This is Snake 0's body.\n4. **RIGHT:** To (5, 7). **Fatal.** This is your own body.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nAt (4, 7), you are currently in a very tight vertical corridor. To your left is Snake 0's body (x=3), and to your right is your own body (x=5). The only direction you can move to survive this turn is UP. \nSnake 0 is at (4, 2) and has access to several apples in the bottom area. While you are currently ahead (17 to 15), your primary goal is to navigate out of this trap. By moving UP to (4, 8), you gain a little more room and can eventually wrap around the top of the board or wait for your tail to clear the right side.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (4, 8) as it is the only safe move. Continue moving into open space to the top and right as segments clear, then reposition to hunt for the remaining apples.\n\nUP",

It is better to stay on the perimeter.\n- Snake #0 is currently at (0, 3) and poses no immediate threat.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue moving DOWN to (9, 4) to collect the first apple. From there, navigate to (8, 3) and then toward the cluster at (6, 4), (6, 1), and (6, 0).

You also have (7, 6) nearby.\n- If you move **LEFT** to (7, 2), your next move can be **LEFT** again to grab the apple at (6, 2).\n- If you move **DOWN** to (8, 1), you are heading towards (6, 1) or (6, 0).\n- Snake #0 is at (1, 8), which is very far away. You have uncontested access to this southern quadrant of the board.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT toward the apple at (6, 2). From there, I can sweep down to pick up (6, 1) and (6, 0), or turn up to get (6, 4). LEFT is the most direct path to the nearest reachable points.\n\nLEFT",

Moves towards (7, 6) or (6, 4).\n*   **DOWN:** (7, 1). Safe. Moves towards (6, 1) and (6, 0).\n*   **RIGHT:** (8, 2). **Fatal.** This is your neck/body.\n*   **LEFT:** (6, 2). Safe. Directly consumes an apple.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nCollecting the apple at **(6, 2)** is the most efficient move. It increases your score to 21 and places you in the middle of a dense cluster of remaining apples.\n*   After moving **LEFT** to (6, 2), your next options will be **DOWN** to get (6, 1) and (6, 0), or **UP** to get (6, 4).\n*   Snake #0 is at (1, 9), which is the opposite corner of the board. You have complete control over the apples in column 6 and 7.\n*   Space is slightly constrained by your own tail in the bottom right, but there is plenty of room to maneuver in the middle of the board.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nGrab (6, 2) this turn. Next, move DOWN to collect (6, 1) and (6, 0) to efficiently clear the bottom cluster before looping back up for (6, 4) and (7, 6).\n\nLEFT",

However, Snake #0's tail is currently at (4, 1). While (5, 1) is currently empty, Snake #0 cannot reach it next turn (it's at 2, 8). \n*   **DOWN:** (5, -1). **Fatal.** Out of bounds.\n*   **RIGHT:** (6, 0). **Fatal.** This is your neck.\n*   **LEFT:** (4, 0). **Safe.** Path towards the apple at (0, 1). Note that Snake #0's body occupies (3, 1), (4, 1), (2, 1), etc.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nSnake #0 is quite far away (Y=8), but its body creates a barrier across the bottom left. You are currently at (5, 0). The apple at (0, 1) is behind Snake #0's body.\nThe most open space is the middle columns (2, 3, 5). Moving UP towards (5, 4) or (5, 5) allows you to approach the clusters of apples at (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6), and (7, 7).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will move LEFT to (4, 0) to check if I can wrap around the bottom-left corner or if I should pivot UP. Since the apple at (0, 1) is enclosed by Snake #0's body, I likely need to head UP through column 5 or 2/3 to reach the main cluster of apples. Moving to (4, 0) keeps options open for now without boxing myself in against the right wall.\n\nLEFT",

Column 3 at (3, 0) and (3, 1) is tricky. Snake #0's tail is at (3, 1). If Snake #0 moves, its tail at (3, 1) will vacate.\nThe apple at (0, 1) is surrounded by Snake #0's body. To reach the cluster of apples at (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), you need to navigate around the massive wall your own body has created on the right and Snake #0 has created on the left.\nCurrently, your head is at (4, 0). Moving LEFT to (3, 0) is the only logical choice to eventually turn UP into the central corridor (columns 2, 3, 5).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (3, 0), then move towards the open space in the middle of the board. I need to be careful of Snake #0's head currently at (2, 7). My goal is to head towards the central apple cluster (6, 4), (6, 5) while staying clear of the \"coils\" formed by both snakes.\n\nLEFT",

While it might move out, moving into a tail is risky if the opponent grows or if the tail doesn't move.\n*   **RIGHT (4, 0):** **Fatal.** This is your neck.\n*   **DOWN (3, -1):** **Fatal.** Out of bounds.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nYour snake is very long (24 segments) and currently occupies most of the bottom and right edges.

It allows you to navigate the center of the board, potentially cutting off Snake #0 from the apple at (0, 1) or racing toward the cluster at (6, 4).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to navigate through the corridor formed by Snake #0's left wall and your own right wall. Head toward the apple cluster at (6, 4) and (6, 5). Monitor Snake #0's head at (2, 6) to avoid a head-on collision as you move up the board.\n\nUP",

Moving RIGHT toward (4, 2) or UP toward (3, 3) are both viable. \n- Moving **RIGHT** is slightly better because it creates more distance from Snake #0's head and moves you directly toward the x-coordinates of the apple cluster (x=6, 7). \n- Note your tail at (4, 8) and (4, 9). You need to be careful not to trap yourself in the center as you grow.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove towards the center and then toward the apple cluster at (6, 4) and (6, 5). Maintain awareness of Snake #0's position to avoid a head-on collision or being cut off from the apples. Avoid moving too far right too quickly, as your own tail occupies columns 8 and 9.\n\nRIGHT",

However, moving to (4, 3) puts you within \"striking distance\" of Snake #0's head at (3, 4). If both snakes move to (4, 4) next turn, a collision is possible.\n- **RIGHT (5, 2):** **Safe.** Moves you toward the empty center-bottom area. This is a very safe move that maintains flexibility and keeps you clear of your own body at x=6,7,8,9.\n- **DOWN (4, 1):** **Safe.** Moves you into the empty space in the bottom row.

You do not need to take extreme risks for the next apple.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (5, 2) allows you to approach the apples at (6, 4) and (6, 5) from the bottom/right, potentially cutting off Snake #0 or forcing them to move higher up. It also keeps your head away from Snake #0's current head position (3, 4).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nShift to (5, 2) then look to move UP toward the (6, 4) apple. By staying slightly to the right of Snake #0, you can use your length to potentially wall off the right side of the board if they try to circle around you. Continue to monitor the gap between your head and your body segments at (6, 0-2).\n\nRIGHT",

Body is quite long, occupying much of the outer perimeter and the bottom row.\n- **Snake #0:** Head at (4, 4). Body is centered and to the left.\n- **Apples:** Clustered at (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7). One isolated apple at (0, 1).\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n- **UP (5, 3):** **Safe.** Moves toward the (6, 4) and (6, 5) apples. It avoids Snake #0\u2019s head (4, 4) since the nearest Snake #0 can get is (4, 3), (4, 5), (5, 4), or (3, 4). A move to (5, 3) is safe from a head-on collision this turn.\n- **RIGHT (6, 2):** **Fatal.** This is your own body.\n- **DOWN (5, 1):** **Safe.** Moves into an empty space, but further away from the current apple cluster.\n- **LEFT (4, 2):** **Fatal.** This is your neck.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- You are leading by 4 apples.\n- Snake #0 is currently positioned at (4, 4), which is adjacent to the apple at (6, 4). If you move UP to (5, 3), you are one step closer to the cluster.\n- The path to the right is blocked by your own body at x=6,7,8. You must move UP to navigate toward the apples or stay in the bottom-middle.\n- Moving UP to (5, 3) allows you to contest (6, 4) or (6, 5) in the subsequent turns.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to (5, 3) to approach the center-right apple cluster. Be wary of Snake #0's head; if they move to (5, 4), you will be adjacent. Use your length to constrain Snake #0's movement if possible, but prioritize safe pathing to the apples at (6, 4) and (6, 5).\n\nUP",

Body segments are at (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), etc.\n- **Apples:** Clustered at (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7). One isolated at (0, 1).\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n- **UP:** Moves to (5, 4). This is a **FATAL** move. Snake #0's head is currently at (5, 4). Moving here results in an immediate collision with Snake #0's head/body. Even if Snake #0 moves, its body segment occupies (5, 4) this turn.\n- **DOWN:** Moves to (5, 2). This is a **FATAL** move. This is your own body (your neck).\n- **LEFT:** Moves to (4, 3). This is **SAFE**. It avoids both your body and Snake #0's body.\n- **RIGHT:** Moves to (6, 3). This is **SAFE**. Snake #0's head is at (5, 4), so it could potentially move to (6, 4) or (5, 5). Moving to (6, 3) is safe from immediate collision.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- You are currently locked in a tight spot near the center. Snake #0 is directly above you.\n- To the RIGHT (6, 3), you have an open path to move towards the cluster of apples at (6, 4) and (6, 5). However, moving to (6, 3) places you beneath Snake #0. If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (5, 3), it hits your old head position. If it moves RIGHT to (6, 4), it gets an apple. \n- To the LEFT (4, 3), you move toward a more open area on the board (the bottom-middle-left), but away from the current apple cluster.\n- Given the proximity of Snake #0, moving RIGHT (6, 3) is the most aggressive and productive path toward the apples, but LEFT (4, 3) is safer for repositioning. However, (6, 3) is more beneficial to contest the high-value apple area. \n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (6, 3) to approach the apple cluster. From there, aim to move UP to (6, 4) or (7, 3) to navigate around your own tail and Snake #0's head. Maintain the lead while monitoring Snake #0's movement in the center.\n\nRIGHT",

This is your own body.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Your body is coiled in a way that blocks LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN.\n- **UP (7, 4)** is your only legal move this turn. \n- Snake #0 is currently at (6, 5). If it moves RIGHT to (7, 5), it will be directly above you next turn. If it moves DOWN to (6, 4), it hits its own body. It will likely move UP to (6, 6) or towards (5, 5).\n- By moving UP, you begin to navigate the space between your own tail at x=9 and the enemy body segments at x=6 to reach the apples cluster.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to (7, 4). Continue UP to contest (7, 6) and (8, 7). Be cautious of Snake #0's head as you both move into the upper-right quadrant. Your current objective is to secure the apples at (7, 6) and (8, 7) to maintain your lead while navigating the narrow corridor created by your tail at x=9 and your middle body segments at x=8.\n\nUP",

This snake moved from (7, 7) to (8, 7), which is where an apple likely was or where it is contesting space. (Note: Looking at the coordinates provided, the opponent's head is now at (8, 7)).\n*   **Apples:** (0, 1), (5, 5), (4, 1), (8, 9), (1, 2).\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n*   **UP:** Moves to (8, 7). **FATAL**. This is Snake #0's current head position. Even if they move, you would be moving into their body or risking a head-on collision.\n*   **DOWN:** Moves to (8, 5). **FATAL**. This is your immediate neck/body.\n*   **LEFT:** Moves to (7, 6). **FATAL**. This is Snake #0's body.\n*   **RIGHT:** Moves to (9, 6). **FATAL**. This is your own body.\n\nWait, looking at the board state and history:\nYour Head: (8, 6).\nYour Body: (8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4), ... (9, 6).\nEnemy Head: (8, 7).\nEnemy Body: (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5)...\n\nRe-evaluating surroundings of (8, 6):\n- (8, 7): Occupied by Enemy Head.\n- (8, 5): Occupied by your Head's previous position (neck).\n- (7, 6): Occupied by Enemy Body.\n- (9, 6): Occupied by your Body.\n\nActually, let's look at the movement of the tail. Your tail is at (9, 6). When you move, the tail at (9, 6) will move to (9, 5). Therefore, the coordinate (9, 6) will become empty this turn. In Snake games, moves into the current tail position are typically safe unless you eat an apple this turn. \n\nWait\u2014Snake #0 is at (8, 7). If I move UP to (8, 7), I die or collide. I cannot move LEFT (7, 6) because of the enemy body. I cannot move DOWN (8, 5) because it's my neck. The only potentially technical \"safe\" move depends on the growth rule. Since I am NOT eating an apple at (9, 6), the tail segment at (9, 6) will vacating.\n\nHowever, there's an error in my assessment of the grid. Let's look at the board again:\nHead (8, 6). \nRight: (9, 6) - This is your tail.\nUp: (8, 7) - This is Snake 0 head.\nLeft: (7, 6) - This is Snake 0 body.\nDown: (8, 5) - This is your body.\n\nIf Snake 0 moves UP to (8, 8), (8, 7) becomes a body part. If I move UP, I hit it. The only possible move to survive is moving into my tail's location at (9, 6), assuming I do not grow.\n\nRIGHT",

This is currently your tail. Since you are not eating an apple at (9, 6), your tail at (9, 5) will move forward this turn, making (9, 5) empty/safe.\n*   **UP:** Moves to (9, 7).

This is off-board.\n\n**Spatial/Strategic Assessment:**\n*   You are currently on the right wall. The enemy snake (8, 8) is positioned above you and slightly to the left.\n*   If you move UP to (9, 7), the enemy head at (8, 8) could potentially move to (9, 8) or (8, 9), effectively trapping you against the wall or top corner.\n*   The apple at (8, 9) is very close to the enemy.\n*   By moving DOWN to (9, 5), you follow your own body's retreat. Your body currently loops around the bottom. This keeps you safe and allows you to eventually navigate toward the clusters of apples on the left side (0,1), (1,2), (4,1) once your current body segments clear those paths.\n\n**Plan:**\nFollow the tail down along the right edge. This is the safest way to clear space and reposition without getting cut off by the enemy snake #0, who currently controls the top-right quadrant.\n\nUP",

However, since there is no apple at (6, 9), the tail moves forward normally.\n    *   Wait, the \"Body\" list includes the neck. Looking at the provided Body list for Snake #0: `[(7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), ...]`.\n    *   Wait, (8, 9) is safe *only if* the snake moves and the segment at (8, 9) is the tail? No, (8, 9) is the segment after the neck. It will not be empty this turn.\n\n**Wait, let me look at the board again:**\nRow 9: `9 . T T T . . 0 T T 1`\n*   (6, 9) is `0` (Enemy Head)\n*   (7, 9) is `T` (Enemy Body)\n*   (8, 9) is `T` (Enemy Body)\n*   (9, 9) is `1` (Your Head)\n\nColumn 9:\n*   (9, 9) is your head.\n*   (9, 8) is your neck.\n\n**Available Moves from (9, 9):**\n*   UP: (9, 10) - Walls.\n*   RIGHT: (10, 9) - Walls.\n*   DOWN: (9, 8) - Your own body.\n*   LEFT: (8, 9) - Snake #0's body.\n\nEvery single direction results in death. However, in simultaneous-move Snake, if I move into a cell that is currently occupied by a tail, and that tail moves forward this turn, I survive. Looking at Snake #0's body: `[(7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), ..., (1, 5)]`. The tail of Snake #0 is at (1, 5). Therefore, the segment at (8, 9) is NOT the tail and will not move out of the way.\n\nActually, looking at the board layout again:\nHead (9, 9).\nLEFT is (8, 9). Snake #0 body.\nDOWN is (9, 8). Your body.\nUp/Right are walls.\n\nI am trapped. My only hope is to move LEFT and pray that the enemy snake was much shorter than the list suggests or that there's a typo in the board state.
