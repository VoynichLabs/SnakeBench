Avoid moving blindly toward enemy head region until longer.  \n\n**Final choice:**  \n\nLEFT",

Yes, there\u2019s an apple at (8,2).  \n  Would eating it kill me next turn? Let\u2019s check safety:  \n  Moving onto apple is safe unless enemy also moves there (head-on collision).  \n  Enemy at (7,7) is far; UP from (7,7) goes to (7,8), not (8,2). So no head-on risk.  \n  So UP is safe and gets apple.\n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8,0) \u2192 no apple. Safe? Yes, empty cell, on board, no body, enemy far.  \n  But moves away from most apples except (5,0) which is closer to (8,0) than (8,1).\n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7,1) \u2192 no apple. Safe? Yes, empty cell, on board, no body, enemy far.\n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,1) \u2192 off board \u2192 **invalid** (dies immediately).\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Which is best?**\n\nUP: gets apple immediately, grows to length 2 next turn (head at (8,2), tail at (8,1)).  \nAlso puts me closer to apple (8,5) above later.  \nNo immediate risk.\n\nDOWN: moves toward apple (5,0) eventually, but misses chance to eat (8,2) now.  \nLEFT: moves toward center but no apple nearby.\n\nEating early is good because longer snake can block enemy later.  \nAlso, enemy snake at (7,7) might go for (6,7) apple or (8,5) apple, but (8,2) is closer to me than to enemy.\n\n**Future safety after eating apple:**  \nIf I take UP to (8,2) and eat apple, next turn my body will be [(8,2), (8,1)].  \nPossible moves from (8,2): UP to (8,3), DOWN to (8,1) (occupied by my body, so not safe), LEFT to (7,2), RIGHT to (9,2) (off board, not safe).  \nSo only UP and LEFT safe next turn if I grow now. That\u2019s still okay \u2014 I can go UP toward (8,5) apple.\n\n**Enemy prediction:**  \nEnemy at (7,7) likely goes for (6,7) apple (LEFT) or (8,5) apple (RIGHT+DOWN-ish). Not an immediate threat.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nUP gets apple, is safe, gives growth advantage early.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (8,2), choose between UP (to (8,3)) or LEFT (to (7,2)) depending on enemy position then.

          "rationale": "Let\u2019s analyze the current state:  \n\n**My snake (ID 1):**  \nHead at (8, 3), body at [(8, 2)], length 2.  \n\n**Apples:** (2,1), (8,5), (5,0), (2,8), (6,3).  \n\n**Enemy snake (#0):** Head at (6,6), body at [(6,7)], length 2.  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Possible moves from (8,3):  \n- **UP** \u2192 (8,4)  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (8,2) \u2192 occupied by my own body \u2192 **not safe**  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (7,3)  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,3) \u2192 within board? Yes, board is 0\u20139 in x, 0\u20139 in y.  \n\nSo DOWN is immediately eliminated.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Check for enemy body collision:  \nEnemy body: [(6,7)] \u2192 not in any of (8,4), (7,3), (9,3).  \nEnemy head at (6,6) currently.  \n\nBut we must consider enemy\u2019s possible moves this turn:  \nEnemy can move UP to (6,7)? That\u2019s its own body \u2192 not allowed.  \nEnemy moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (6,7) body \u2192 illegal.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,5)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,6)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,6)  \n\nSo enemy head will be at (6,5), (5,6), or (7,6) next turn.  \nNone of my possible moves are those coordinates, so **no immediate head-on collision possible** (since enemy can\u2019t reach my possible cells in 1 move from (6,6)).  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Check future safety (next turn options):  \n\n**Option UP to (8,4):**  \nFrom (8,4), possible moves: UP to (8,5) (apple there), DOWN to (8,3) (my current head, will be empty next turn since I moved), LEFT to (7,4), RIGHT to (9,4).  \nAll four are inside board. No current snake bodies in those except maybe enemy moves? Enemy body next turn: old head (6,6) becomes body, old tail (6,7) stays? Wait, enemy length 2, so if enemy moves, tail (6,7) disappears and new head position becomes body, old head (6,6) becomes tail? Actually Snake #0: head (6,6), body [(6,7)]. After moving, new head at new position, old head (6,6) becomes body[0], old body (6,7) is removed (since no apple eaten unless they eat one). They haven\u2019t eaten this turn, so length stays 2. So enemy body next turn: [(6,6)] only. So enemy body cells: (6,6).  \nFrom (8,4), my possible next moves nowhere near (6,6). So safe.  \n\n**Option LEFT to (7,3):**  \nFrom (7,3), possible moves: UP (7,4), DOWN (7,2), LEFT (6,3) (apple there), RIGHT (8,3) (empty next turn).  \nAll inside board. No immediate danger.  \n\n**Option RIGHT to (9,3):**  \nFrom (9,3), possible moves: UP (9,4), DOWN (9,2), LEFT (8,3) (empty), RIGHT off board \u2192 so only 3 moves available. Being on edge reduces options.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Apples proximity:  \nClosest apple to my head (8,3):  \n- (8,5): 2 steps away (UP, UP)  \n- (6,3): 2 steps away (LEFT, LEFT)  \n- (5,0): 5 steps  \n- (2,1): 6 steps  \n- (2,8): 6 steps  \n\n(8,5) and (6,3) are equally close in Manhattan distance.  \n\n**UP** gets me closer to (8,5).  \n**LEFT** gets me closer to (6,3).  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Enemy\u2019s possible target:  \nEnemy at (6,6): closest apples: (6,3) 3 steps, (8,5) 3 steps, (2,8) 6 steps, (5,0) 6 steps, (2,1) 7 steps.  \nSo enemy might also target (6,3) or (8,5).  \n\nIf I go UP, I\u2019m heading toward (8,5). Enemy could try to get there too, but they\u2019re farther.  \nIf I go LEFT toward (6,3), enemy is closer to (6,3) than I am if I start at (8,3) and go LEFT twice (needs 2 moves) vs enemy at (6,6) needs 3 moves? Actually enemy at (6,6) to (6,3): down 3 steps (6,5),(6,4),(6,3) \u2192 3 moves. I need LEFT to (7,3), then LEFT to (6,3) \u2192 2 moves. So I can get there in 2 moves, enemy in 3 moves. So I win race to (6,3) if I go LEFT now.  \n\nBut going LEFT now means: move to (7,3), then next turn move LEFT to (6,3) to eat apple. Enemy could move DOWN twice to (6,4) then (6,3) same time as me? Let\u2019s check:  \nTurn 4: I move LEFT to (7,3), enemy moves DOWN to (6,5).  \nTurn 5: I move LEFT to (6,3) to eat apple, enemy moves DOWN to (6,4). So I get apple before enemy.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Which is safer long-term?  \nUP to (8,4) \u2192 next to apple (8,5), can eat next turn if I go UP again. Enemy not close enough to interfere.  \nLEFT to (7,3) \u2192 next to apple (6,3), can eat next turn if I go LEFT again. Enemy might try to race but I\u2019d win.  \n\nBut going LEFT puts me closer to enemy\u2019s area, possibly risking future head-on collisions if enemy moves toward same apple.  \n\nAlso, from (8,4) I have more open space (center-right side) than from (7,3) which is nearer enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nTarget apple (8,5) seems safer because enemy is farther from it. Once I eat it, I\u2019ll be length 3 and can consider other apples.  \n\nSo this turn: **UP** to (8,4), next turn UP to (8,5) to eat apple.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

Safe.  \n- Not colliding with enemy body: enemy body is at (6, 5). Safe.  \n- Enemy head currently at (6, 6), so not same cell now.  \n- But enemy might move into (8, 6) this turn? Let\u2019s check enemy possible moves from (6, 6):  \n  - UP (6, 7)  \n  - DOWN (6, 5) \u2013 but that\u2019s its own body \u2192 deadly for them, so they wouldn\u2019t choose it unless forced.  \n  - LEFT (5, 6)  \n  - RIGHT (7, 6)  \nSo enemy could move RIGHT to (7, 6), not to (8, 6). Could they move UP to (6, 7)? That\u2019s possible.  \nHead-on collision happens only if both move into same cell simultaneously. Enemy cannot reach (8, 6) in one move, so no risk of head-on here.  \n\nSo UP is safe from immediate death.  \n\n**DOWN (8, 4):**  \n- That\u2019s my own body segment \u2192 deadly. Eliminate.  \n\n**LEFT (7, 5):**  \n- Within board: yes.  \n- Not my body: safe.  \n- Not enemy body: safe.  \n- Enemy head moving to (7, 5)? From (6, 6), enemy moving DOWN is (6, 5) (own body, deadly). Enemy moving LEFT is (5, 6). Enemy moving RIGHT is (7, 6). Enemy moving UP is (6, 7). So enemy cannot reach (7, 5) in one move.  \n- Safe.  \n\n**RIGHT (9, 5):**  \n- Within board: yes (x=9 valid).  \n- Not my body: safe.  \n- Not enemy body: safe.  \n- Enemy cannot reach (9, 5) in one move.  \n- Safe.  \n\nSo deadly moves: only DOWN.  \n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Evaluate safe moves:**  \n\n**UP (8, 6):**  \n- Gets me closer to apple at (1, 6)? Not really \u2014 that\u2019s far left. Apple at (2, 8) is closer in y direction but far in x.  \n- Future moves from (8, 6): possible moves: UP to (8, 7), DOWN to (8, 5) (my tail will move away maybe), LEFT to (7, 6), RIGHT to (9, 6). All likely safe next turn except maybe if enemy moves into one.  \n- Enemy at (6, 6) could move RIGHT to (7, 6) \u2014 then (7, 6) could be dangerous for me if I go LEFT next turn. But not immediate issue.  \n\n**LEFT (7, 5):**  \n- Moves toward center, away from right edge.  \n- From (7, 5), future moves: UP (7, 6), DOWN (7, 4), LEFT (6, 5) \u2014 but (6, 5) is enemy body currently, but enemy head moving from (6, 6) might leave that cell empty next turn? Actually enemy body is at (6, 5), enemy head at (6, 6). If enemy moves DOWN into (6, 5), they die. So they probably won\u2019t. So (6, 5) might stay as enemy body next turn if enemy moves elsewhere (body stays until they eat). So moving LEFT to (6, 5) next turn would be deadly. That\u2019s one less option.  \n\n**RIGHT (9, 5):**  \n- Puts me near right edge. From (9, 5), only LEFT, UP, DOWN possible (RIGHT off board). Reduces future options.  \n- Not closer to any apple except maybe (6, 3) but that\u2019s down-left.  \n\nApple at (6, 3) is closest to me currently? Let\u2019s check distances:  \nFrom (8, 5) to (6, 3): Manhattan distance 4.  \nFrom (8, 5) to (2, 8): distance 11.  \nFrom (8, 5) to (1, 6): distance 8.  \nFrom (8, 5) to (5, 0): distance 8.  \nFrom (8, 5) to (2, 1): distance 10.  \n\nActually apple at (6, 3) is closest.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 5), distance to (6, 3) becomes 3.  \nIf I go UP to (8, 6), distance becomes 5.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 5), distance becomes 7.  \n\nSo LEFT gets me closer to the nearest apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Check collision risk with enemy head:**  \n\nEnemy at (6, 6) possible moves:  \n- UP (6, 7)  \n- LEFT (5, 6)  \n- RIGHT (7, 6)  \n- DOWN deadly.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 5), enemy going RIGHT to (7, 6) is safe (different y). Enemy going DOWN deadly. Enemy going UP/LEFT safe. So no head-on risk.  \n\nIf I go UP to (8, 6), enemy could go RIGHT to (7, 6) \u2014 no conflict.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 5), enemy can\u2019t reach me.  \n\nSo all safe from head-on.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Choose:**  \n\nLEFT seems best:  \n- Closer to nearest apple (6, 3).  \n- Keeps future options open (not near edge).  \n- Avoids risky positions.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 5), apple at (6, 3) is close. Consider moving DOWN/LEFT next turn if safe. Watch enemy at (6, 6) \u2014 they might move toward (6, 5) area or toward apples too. Avoid moving into their possible path.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

We should avoid cells enemy might move into if head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3: Check for head-on collisions.**\nIf we move LEFT to (6,4), could enemy move to (6,4)? No, enemy is at (5,7), can\u2019t reach (6,4) in one move.  \nIf we move DOWN to (7,3), enemy can\u2019t reach (7,3) in one move.  \nIf we move RIGHT to (8,4), enemy can\u2019t reach (8,4).\n\nSo no direct head-on collision possible this turn regardless of enemy move.\n\n**Step 4: Check for moving into enemy body after enemy moves.**  \nEnemy body currently at (5,6). After enemy moves, its tail might move? Wait \u2014 snakes grow only when they eat an apple. Snake 0 has length 2 (head + 1 body). It will move, its tail cell (5,6) might be vacated unless it eats an apple this turn.  \nWe don\u2019t know if enemy will eat an apple. But currently apple at (5,0) far away, so it won\u2019t eat this turn likely. So enemy\u2019s tail (5,6) will become empty after it moves.\n\nThus enemy body after move will be at: new head position, and old head (5,7) becomes body. So enemy body cells next turn: (5,7) and (5,6) stays? Wait, no:  \nSnake length 2: head at (5,7), body at (5,6).  \nIf enemy moves UP to (5,8): new head (5,8), body becomes [(5,7)], tail (5,6) disappears.  \nSo enemy body next turn: (5,7) only if it moves UP.\n\nSo if we move to (6,4), (7,3), or (8,4), none are (5,7) or (5,6) currently, but after move, enemy body could be at (5,7) if enemy moves UP. Our moves don\u2019t intersect that.\n\nSo all three moves safe from enemy body collision.\n\n**Step 5: Apples proximity.**  \nApple at (6,3) is closest to us: from (7,4):\n- DOWN to (7,3): distance to (6,3) is 2 steps (L then D or D then L).\n- LEFT to (6,4): distance to (6,3) is 1 step DOWN next.\n- RIGHT to (8,4): farther from (6,3).\n\nSo LEFT then DOWN next gets apple quick.\n\nAlso apple at (2,1), (5,0), (2,8), (1,6) farther.\n\n**Step 6: Future mobility after move.**  \nLet\u2019s check each safe move:\n\n- **DOWN to (7,3)**: From (7,3), possible moves next turn: UP back to (7,4) (occupied by our old head? No, our body after move: head at (7,3), body at [(7,4), (7,5), (8,5)]? Wait, we didn\u2019t eat apple, so length stays 3: head new at (7,3), body: old head (7,4) becomes first body segment, then (7,5), then (8,5) is tail. So (7,4) occupied, so UP from (7,3) next turn invalid.  \nFrom (7,3), possible: DOWN (7,2), LEFT (6,3) apple maybe, RIGHT (8,3). So 3 options next turn.\n\n- **LEFT to (6,4)**: From (6,4), body: [(7,4), (7,5), (8,5)]. So possible moves: UP (6,5) free, DOWN (6,3) apple, LEFT (5,4) free, RIGHT (7,4) body. So 3 options.\n\n- **RIGHT to (8,4)**: From (8,4), body: [(7,4), (7,5), (8,5)]. Possible moves: UP (8,5) body, DOWN (8,3) free, LEFT (7,4) body, RIGHT (9,4) free. So 2 options only.\n\nSo RIGHT is worst for mobility.\n\n**Step 7: Avoid dead ends.**  \nBoard 10x10, we are not near edge except RIGHT to (9,4) next turn could be okay but fewer options.\n\nLEFT and DOWN both give 3 options next turn.\n\nApple at (6,3) is directly DOWN from (6,4). So if we go LEFT now to (6,4), next turn DOWN to (6,3) eats apple. That\u2019s efficient.\n\nIf we go DOWN now to (7,3), then LEFT to (6,3) eats apple next turn too, but that\u2019s same timing.\n\nBut going LEFT now to (6,4) also moves us closer to other apples maybe.\n\nAlso, from (6,4), we can go DOWN to (6,3) apple next turn, then grow, which gives more future space.\n\nLet\u2019s choose LEFT to get closer to apple cluster (6,3), (2,1), etc.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf apple at (6,3) still there next turn, move DOWN to eat it unless unsafe. Keep enemy head in mind \u2014 enemy at (5,7) could move to (6,7) or (4,7) etc., far from (6,3). So likely safe.\n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Let's assess the current board.\n\n**Current state:**  \nMy snake (ID 1): head at (5,4), body at [(6,4), (7,4)], length 3.  \nEnemy snake #0: head at (4,8), body at [(5,8)], length 2.  \nApples: (2,1), (5,0), (2,8), (6,3), (1,6).  \n\nFrom last turn rationale: I moved DOWN to (6,3) to eat apple there. Wait \u2014 but the board shows head at (5,4), body (6,4), (7,4). That means last turn I moved LEFT (from (6,4) to (5,4)), not DOWN. The \"last move information\" says my last move was LEFT, but rationale inside it says DOWN. That seems contradictory \u2014 but the current game state is authoritative, so last turn I must have moved LEFT (from (6,4) to (5,4)), and apple at (6,3) is still there. Yes, board shows A at (6,3). So I didn't eat it last turn. Possibly enemy ate something else? But apple (6,3) still present. Good.\n\nNow possible moves from (5,4):\n\n- UP \u2192 (5,5): empty, safe? No snake body there, not off board.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,3): empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,4): empty, safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,4): my own body segment (current neck), so unsafe (hitting own body).\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n(6,3) is one move DOWN from (5,4)? Wait: (5,4) \u2192 DOWN is (5,3), not (6,3). So DOWN does not go directly onto apple.  \n(6,3) is actually RIGHT then DOWN from (5,4), but RIGHT is blocked. So can't get (6,3) in one move.  \nClosest apples:  \n(6,3) is 2 moves away (RIGHT+DOWN or DOWN+RIGHT, but RIGHT blocked now).  \n(5,0) is far down.  \n(2,1) far left-down.  \n(2,8) far up-left.  \n(1,6) far left-up.\n\nNo apple in immediate one-step reach except none.\n\n**Enemy possible moves:**  \nEnemy head at (4,8), body at (5,8). Safe moves for enemy: UP to (4,9), DOWN to (4,7), LEFT to (3,8), RIGHT to (5,8) is own body so unsafe. So enemy can move UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nCould enemy reach (5,4) or my move target? Unlikely in one move: from (4,8) to (5,4) is distance 5 in Manhattan, impossible. So no direct head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Future mobility:**  \nFrom (5,5) (if UP): possible next moves: UP to (5,6), LEFT to (4,5), RIGHT to (6,5), DOWN back to (5,4) (but that's current head position, safe if body moved).  \nFrom (5,3) (if DOWN): next moves: DOWN to (5,2), LEFT to (4,3), RIGHT to (6,3) (apple!), UP back to (5,4).  \nFrom (4,4) (if LEFT): next moves: UP to (4,5), DOWN to (4,3), LEFT to (3,4), RIGHT to (5,4) (current head, safe later).\n\nAll three safe moves keep good mobility.\n\n**Strategy:** Want to get apples while staying safe. Apple at (6,3) is tempting: if I go DOWN to (5,3), next turn RIGHT to (6,3) eats it (unless enemy takes it first? enemy at (4,8) far). Also apple at (5,0) is directly below (5,3), could go down later.\n\nBut apple at (2,8) is near enemy head (4,8), maybe enemy will go for it. Apple at (1,6) also near enemy? Not really.\n\nGiven my apple lead (2 vs enemy 1), I can play safe, avoid risky race to apple that enemy might also target. But (6,3) is closer to me than enemy.\n\nLet\u2019s check: enemy at (4,8) to (6,3) requires 7 moves Manhattan, I can get there in 2 moves. So likely mine if I move toward it.\n\nBest path to (6,3): from (5,4) \u2192 DOWN to (5,3) \u2192 RIGHT to (6,3) eats apple. That\u2019s safe now (DOWN safe).  \n\nLEFT to (4,4) also fine but doesn\u2019t progress toward nearest apple.\n\nUP to (5,5) moves away from apple (6,3).\n\nSo DOWN seems best for apple-seeking.\n\n**Potential trap?** After eating apple at (6,3), length becomes 4, body: head at (6,3), body [(5,4),(6,4),(7,4)]? Wait, current body is (6,4),(7,4). After move DOWN to (5,3), body becomes [(5,4),(6,4),(7,4)]? Actually: head moves to (5,3), tail moves? No apple eaten, so tail moves off (7,4) \u2192 body becomes [(5,4),(6,4)]? Let\u2019s simulate: current: head (5,4), body segments: (6,4), (7,4). Move DOWN to (5,3): new head at (5,3), add to front, shift body: new body = [(5,3), (5,4), (6,4)], tail (7,4) removed. Yes length 3 still. Then next turn RIGHT to (6,3) eats apple: head at (6,3), body becomes [(6,3), (5,3), (5,4), (6,4)], length 4. That seems fine.\n\nCheck safety of (5,3) now: no enemy body there, not off board, not my body (my body is at (6,4),(7,4),(5,4)? Wait (5,4) is current head, but after move head leaves (5,4) becomes neck, so (5,3) is not in current body. Safe.\n\nSo DOWN is safe and progresses toward apple.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move DOWN now to (5,3), then RIGHT to (6,3) to eat apple next turn unless enemy somehow gets it first (impossible in one move). After eating, assess board for next nearest apple, possibly (5,0) or (2,1). Keep away from enemy head path.\n\n**Final choice:** DOWN\n\nDOWN",

Wait, snake growth only if eat apple. No apple at (6,2), so length stays 4.

Check head-on collisions: none of our safe moves coincide with any possible enemy move this turn. Also, after movement, our head will not be in any enemy body, and enemy head will not be in our body, regardless of enemy move. So all three moves are safe.\n\nNow evaluate each safe move:\n\n- UP to (2,3): Closest apple is (4,4) at distance 3. Future mobility from (2,3): UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe (3 options). Good.\n- LEFT to (1,2): Closest apple is (4,4) at distance 5. Future mobility from (1,2): UP, DOWN, LEFT safe (3 options). But farther from apples.\n- RIGHT to (3,2): Closest apple is (4,4) at distance 3. Future mobility from (3,2): only UP and RIGHT safe (2 options). Reduced mobility.\n\nThus, RIGHT is less desirable due to fewer future options. Between UP and LEFT, UP is better because it is closer to the apple at (4,4) and keeps us more central.\n\nLong-term plan: Move towards apple at (4,4) while maintaining mobility.

Unsafe.\n\n3. **LEFT** to (1,3):  \n   - Not off board.  \n   - Not in my body.  \n   - Not in enemy body.  \n   Safe unless enemy head collides.\n\n4. **RIGHT** to (3,3):  \n   - Not off board.  \n   - Not in my body.  \n   - Not in enemy body.  \n   Safe unless enemy head collides.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Check head-on collision possibilities with enemy snake #0:**  \nEnemy head at (1,5). Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP to (1,6): into own body (segment behind head), unsafe for them.  \n- DOWN to (1,4): safe (not in any body currently).  \n- LEFT to (0,5): safe.  \n- RIGHT to (2,5): safe.  \n\nMy possible safe moves: UP (2,4), LEFT (1,3), RIGHT (3,3).\n\nCheck if any of my destinations could be the same as enemy's possible destinations this turn:  \nEnemy possible destinations: (1,4), (0,5), (2,5).  \nMy destinations: (2,4), (1,3), (3,3).  \nNo overlap \u2192 no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\nAlso, check if enemy head could land on my body after move:  \nMy body after move will not include (1,4),(0,5),(2,5) except if enemy goes RIGHT to (2,5) \u2014 my body cells are (2,2),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1), so no.  \nCheck if my head could land on enemy body after move: enemy body cells remain (1,6),(1,7),(2,7). My destinations not in those.\n\nSo all three moves UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Evaluate future mobility & apples proximity:**\n\nApples: (4,4) is closest to me currently at distance |2-4|+|3-4| = 3.  \n(5,0) distance 6, (8,5) distance 8, (9,0) distance 10, (3,9) distance 7.\n\nFrom each candidate:\n\n- **UP to (2,4):**  \n  Next moves from (2,4): UP to (2,5), DOWN to (2,3), LEFT to (1,4), RIGHT to (3,4).  \n  Check safety next turn preliminarily:  \n    - UP (2,5): not in my future body (my body will be [(2,4),(2,3),(2,2),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1)] tail at (5,1)? Wait, after moving UP my body becomes: head (2,4), then (2,3),(2,2),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1)? No, length is 6, so after moving UP without eating apple: new head (2,4), old head (2,3) becomes segment 2, then (2,2),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1), tail (5,1) drops off? Correction: snake length = body length + head = 6 total segments. When moving without eating apple, head moves to new cell, each body segment shifts forward, tail cell is removed. So after UP: head (2,4), body: (2,3),(2,2),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1). Tail (5,1) gone. So body cells: (2,3),(2,2),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1).  \n    So next turn from (2,4), possible moves:  \n    UP (2,5): not in body, safe unless enemy there.  \n    DOWN (2,3): in body (second segment), unsafe.  \n    LEFT (1,4): safe.  \n    RIGHT (3,4): safe.  \n  So 3 safe options from there.  \n  Closest apple from (2,4): (4,4) distance 2. Good.\n\n- **LEFT to (1,3):**  \n  Next moves from (1,3): UP (1,4), DOWN (1,2), LEFT (0,3), RIGHT (2,3).  \n  Body after LEFT: head (1,3), body: (2,3),(2,2),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1).  \n  Check: DOWN (1,2) not in body, UP (1,4) not in body, LEFT (0,3) not in body, RIGHT (2,3) in body (segment behind head). So 3 safe options.  \n  Closest apple from (1,3): (4,4) distance 4. Worse than UP.\n\n- **RIGHT to (3,3):**  \n  Next moves from (3,3): UP (3,4), DOWN (3,2), LEFT (2,3), RIGHT (4,3).  \n  Body after RIGHT: head (3,3), body: (2,3),(2,2),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1).  \n  Check: DOWN (3,2) not in body, UP (3,4) not in body, LEFT (2,3) in body (segment behind head), RIGHT (4,3) not in body. So 3 safe options actually (DOWN, UP, RIGHT).  \n  Closest apple from (3,3): (4,4) distance 2, same as UP.\n\nSo all three have 3 safe moves next turn. Apples: UP and RIGHT equally close to (4,4), LEFT farther.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Consider enemy movement & apple competition:**  \nEnemy at (1,5) might go for (4,4) via (2,5) \u2192 (3,5) \u2192 (4,4) etc. If I go RIGHT to (3,3), I could be closer but might race enemy. If I go UP to (2,4), next turn UP to (2,5) could be contested with enemy if enemy goes RIGHT to (2,5) this turn. But enemy might not go RIGHT if they think I'll be there.\n\nBetter to go UP now, then next turn decide based on enemy position. UP also keeps central.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nWe're heading toward (4,4). Enemy may also target it. From (2,4), next turn if enemy at (2,5), avoid head-on, maybe go LEFT to (1,4) or RIGHT to (3,4) to approach apple from different side. Keep mobility high.\n\n---\n\nUP",
