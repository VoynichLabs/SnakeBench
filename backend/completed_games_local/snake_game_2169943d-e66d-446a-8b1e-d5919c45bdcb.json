Time to get strategic.\n\nFirst, let's scope the board. Apples everywhere! A juicy one at (4,8) is just UP and then maybe RIGHT from us? But let's not get greedy yet, we gotta think survival first. \ud83e\udde0\n\n**THINKING ALOUD:**\nOkay, time to check the four directions from our head at (3,9):\n*   **UP:** Can't go UP! That's y=10, which is OFF THE BOARD. \u274c ELIMINATED.\n*   **DOWN:** y=8. That's the cell (3,8). Looks empty! \u2705 SAFE.\n*   **LEFT:** x=2. That's (2,9). Looks empty! \u2705 SAFE.\n*   **RIGHT:** x=4. That's (4,9). Looks empty! \u2705 SAFE.\n\nSo DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are all safe. No risk of hitting any body or the wall.\n\nNow, which one gives us the best options and gets us closer to an apple?\n*   **RIGHT (to (4,9)):** Puts us one step closer to that apple at (4,8). From there, we could go DOWN to snag it next turn! \ud83c\udf4e Also, it's a pretty open area on the right side of the board for now.\n*   **DOWN (to (3,8)):** Also gets us closer to the apple at (4,8) and others. Still a solid, central move.\n*   **LEFT (to (2,9)):** Takes us toward the left edge. Fewer apples over there immediately, and it could be a bit more limiting. Not the best play.\n\nOur enemy is way down at (7,1) chilling. No immediate threat of collision, so we can focus on our own path.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:** Yo future me, we're heading for that (4,8) apple! Let's secure our first bite and start growing. Keep an eye on the opponent's general area later, but for now, just focus on eating and staying safe in the open right-center of the map. Don't get pushed into a corner! We wanna box HIM in, not the other way around! \ud83d\ude08\n\nRIGHT is the move that gets us directly on the path to that first apple. LET'S GET THIS CONTENT!\n\nRIGHT",

Let's break down this situation:\n\n**My Position:** (7, 1) - Just getting started, head only, 0 apples\n**Enemy Position:** (3, 9) - Also just a head, hanging out in the upper left\n**Turn:** 0/150 - We got plenty of time to work with!\n\nLooking at the apple situation, I see scattered apples everywhere, but let me identify my best options:\n\n**APPLES NEAR ME:**\n- (9, 1) is 2 steps RIGHT - ACCESSIBLE this turn!\n- (5, 2) is LEFT and UP - need 2 moves\n- (2, 0) is way down and left - 5 steps away\n- (8, 7), (9, 7), (6, 4), etc. are scattered around\n\n**ENEMY NEAR APPLES:**\n- (4, 8) is RIGHT and DOWN from them - super close!\n- (2, 7) is LEFT and DOWN - also very accessible\n- (0, 6), (1, 3) in that upper left cluster\n\n**MY POSSIBLE MOVES:**\n- **UP \u2192 (7, 2)** - Safe! Opens up access to apples at (5, 2), (6, 4), (5, 6). Gives me 4 safe follow-up moves. Gets me into the upper apple zones!\n- **DOWN \u2192 (7, 0)** - Safe, but pushes me toward the bottom edge. Limited upside.\n- **LEFT \u2192 (6, 1)** - Safe, defensive position, but I'm not gaining much ground.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8, 1)** - Safe, moves TOWARD (9, 1) apple! But after that, my options get more limited.\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\nIf I go RIGHT, I can grab that (9, 1) apple immediately, which is FIRE! \ud83d\udd25 But then I'm kind of hugging the right wall and might get boxed in.\n\nIf I go UP, I'm positioning myself in the center, getting closer to multiple apples, AND I'm creating distance between me and the enemy. Plus I'm staying away from that upper-left apple cluster they might be eyeing!\n\nThe enemy is at (3, 9) looking at (4, 8) and (2, 7) - both are super accessible to them. They might grab one of those next turn!\n\n**MY PLAN:** I'm going UP to (7, 2)! \n\nThis gives me:\n\u2705 Better board coverage and future options\n\u2705 Access to the apple at (5, 2) next turn\n\u2705 Distance from the enemy\n\u2705 Multiple escape routes if things get spicy\n\u2705 Positioning to hit other apples like (6, 4) and (5, 6)\n\nThe RIGHT move is tempting for immediate gratification, but UP sets me up for a STRONGER long-term game. I want to be the one doing the boxing in, not the one getting boxed! \n\nLet's GOOO! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

We just ate that apple, so we're a big, strong snake of length 2!\n\n**CHECKING THE DIRECTIONS FROM (4,8):**\n*   **UP:** y=9. That's cell **(4,9)**. WAIT A MINUTE \ud83d\udea8 That's where our BODY is! That's instant death! \u274c CANNOT GO UP!\n*   **DOWN:** y=7. Cell **(4,7)**. Looks empty on the board! \u2705 SAFE.\n*   **LEFT:** x=3. Cell **(3,8)**. Also looks empty! \u2705 SAFE.\n*   **RIGHT:** x=5. Cell **(5,8)**. Empty! \u2705 SAFE.\n\nSo our only DEATH MOVE is UP. DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are all on the table. Let's talk strategy!\n\n**THE OPPONENT SITUATION:**\nSnake #1 is still chilling at **(8,2)**. They are SO FAR AWAY. Zero threat right now. We can focus on our own growth.\n\n**THE APPLE SITUATION:**\nThere's a juicy apple at **(5,6)**. To get there, we'd want to start moving RIGHT and then DOWN over the next few turns. The apple at **(6,4)** is also a target for later.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:**\nYo future me! We're setting up a path towards the center and that apple cluster near (5,6)/(6,4)! Let's not get stuck on the top edge. Moving DOWN or RIGHT gets us moving in the right direction. LEFT keeps us on the edge, which might be riskier long-term. The goal is to GROW and then start thinking about cutting off the enemy's space. They're way in the corner, maybe we can slowly take over the board center? \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nAll three safe moves seem okay, but which gives us the best future?\n*   **LEFT:** Puts us at (3,8). Next turn, we'd have walls/edges closer. Feels a bit limiting.\n*   **DOWN:** Puts us at (4,7). Opens up paths DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Good options!\n*   **RIGHT:** Puts us at (5,8). Also opens up paths DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT AND gets us closer to that (5,6) apple! This feels like the proactive, content-getting move! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nChat, the move is clear!

Let's analyze where we at and what's poppin'!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION CHECK:**\n- Me: (8, 2) - vibing in the middle-right\n- Enemy: (4, 8) - still posted up in the upper-left with body at (4, 9)\n- They already got 1 apple, we gotta EQUALIZE that immediately!\n- Turn 2/150 - time to make our move and get on the BOARD!\n\n**MY OPTIONS FROM (8, 2):**\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP \u2192 (8, 3)** - This the PLAY right here!\n- Clean path, no obstacles detected\n- Gets me CLOSER to that (9, 7) apple and also (9, 3) - we're hunting MULTI-APLE!\n- From (8, 3), I can continue UP to (8, 4) or go RIGHT to (9, 3) next turn\n- This keeps me heading toward the APPLE-RICH upper-right corner\n- The enemy is chillin' way over at x=4, so no head-on collision worries from this direction\n- Maximum pressure, minimum risk - that's the winning formula!\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 **RIGHT \u2192 (9, 2)** - Risky move, fam\n- That's the BOARD EDGE right there!\n- From (9, 2), my options would be DOWN or LEFT only - getting boxed in?\n- Nah, we ain't about that defensive life when there are apples to eat\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **DOWN \u2192 (8, 1)** - Too passive, not aggressive\n- Moving DOWN gets me further from the apple action\n- We came to COMPETE, not to play scared!\n\n\ud83d\udd34 **LEFT \u2192 (7, 2)** - Going backwards? Nah\n- Just moving back where I came from\n- That's weak energy, we need to FORWARD!\n\n**STRATEGIC THINKING:**\n\nThe enemy snake is trapped in that upper-left corner with body at (4, 9) - they basically sealed themselves in! They can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT, but UP is BLOCKED by their own body. Meanwhile, I'm out here FREE with the whole right side of the board to dominate!\n\nThose apples at (9, 7), (8, 7), and (9, 3) are just SITTING THERE waiting for me to claim them! Moving UP to (8, 3) sets me up PERFECT to hit (9, 3) next turn OR continue upward toward (8, 7) and (9, 7).\n\nThe enemy might try to come down and contest, but by the time they get over here, I'll already be FEASTING! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**WIN CONDITION FOCUS:**\n- Keep myself ALIVE (obviously \ud83d\udd25)\n- Get to those APPLES and start scoring!\n- Don't get boxed in - keep options OPEN\n- Eventually box the enemy in or trap them\n\nUP to (8, 3) gives me:\n\u2705 Safe path with no collision risks\n\u2705 Continues toward multiple reachable apples\n\u2705 Keeps my options WIDE open for next turns\n\u2705 Maintains distance from enemy territory\n\u2705 Aggressive positioning for maximum apple collection!\n\nLet's EAT, chat! Make it happen! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:**\nAfter moving UP to (8, 3), I'll assess whether to go RIGHT to (9, 3) to grab that apple, or continue UP toward (8, 7). The key is securing those upper-right apples before the enemy can come down and contest!\n\n**FINAL MOVE:**\n\nUP",

The apple at **(6,4)** is also on our radar for the future.\n\n**WHAT'S THE BEST PATH?**\n*   **UP:** Puts us at (5,9). Puts us on the top edge. From there, our only options next turn are LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN (back the way we came). Feels a bit limiting, puts us in a corner. Not ideal for future options.\n*   **RIGHT:** Puts us at (6,8). Keeps us on the top row. Next turn we could go RIGHT again, DOWN, or LEFT. Slightly better than UP, but still keeps us on the edge. Gets us closer to the apple cluster on the right, but that's also where the enemy is heading... could be a future conflict zone!\n*   **DOWN:** Puts us at (5,7). THIS IS THE WAY! \ud83d\udc40 It opens up SO MANY OPTIONS for next turn. From (5,7), we can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again. Most importantly, it DIRECTLY moves us toward our target apple at (5,6)! This is the most proactive, growth-oriented move. We're taking control of the board's center!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:**\nYO FUTURE ME! We are committing to the DOWN path to secure that (5,6) apple! Our goal is to GROW and then start controlling the center of the board. The enemy is on the right side, so as we grow, we might want to start moving right to cut off their expansion and maybe even TRAP THEM against the wall!

Last turn I made a CLEAN move to (9, 3) - but wait, let me check my CURRENT position...\n\n**WAIT WHAT?!** Looking at the board, my head is at (9, 3) but the display shows '1' at (9, 3) AND my body at (8, 3). That's... that's backwards from what I thought! Let me recalculate REAL quick:\n\n- My head: (9, 3) \u2705\n- My body: (8, 3) \u2705\n- My tail: (7, 3) - that's the 'T' at row 3, column 7!\n\nOkay so I'm at the RIGHT EDGE of the board, head at x=9. Let me assess my options from (9, 3):\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf MOVES FROM (9, 3):**\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 **RIGHT \u2192 (10, 3)** - OFF THE BOARD! \u274c DEATH! We're not doing that, chat!\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **UP \u2192 (9, 4)** - Let's check this out!\n- What's at (9, 4)? Looking at row 4... all dots, no apple, no snakes\n- From there I could go to (9, 5) or LEFT to (8, 4)\n- Apple at (8, 4) would be accessible\n- This keeps me in the right-side corridor\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **DOWN \u2192 (9, 2)** - Looking at row 2...\n- No apple at (9, 2), but apple at (9, 1) is ONE DOWN from there\n- Row 9, column 2 is clear - safe move\n- Could continue down to (9, 1) for an apple next turn\n- Enemy is far away at (5, 7), no collision worries\n\n\ud83d\udfe2 **LEFT \u2192 (8, 3)** - OH BABY, THERE'S AN APPLE AT (8, 3)!!!\n- That's a FREE POINT right there!\n- My body is currently AT (8, 3), but remember: we move HEAD FIRST\n- After I move to (8, 3), my body will be at [(8, 3), (9, 3)]\n- The apple at (8, 3) means I grow and get +1 point!\n- From (8, 3), I can go UP to (8, 4) or continue LEFT to (7, 3)\n\n**\ud83e\udde0 STRATEGIC THINKING:**\n\nThe apple at (8, 3) is literally RIGHT THERE calling my name! But wait, I need to be CAREFUL about the follow-up...\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8, 3):\n- \u2705 I grab the apple and we're TIED on the scoreboard!\n- \u2705 My new body becomes [(8, 3), (9, 3)]\n- \u26a0\ufe0f From (8, 3), my options are UP to (8, 4) or LEFT to (7, 3)\n- If I go LEFT again to (7, 3), that's where my tail CURRENTLY is\n- But by the time I get there next turn, my tail will have moved!\n\n**ALTERNATIVE: DOWN to (9, 2)**\n- No immediate point, but I'm heading toward the (9, 1) apple\n- Keeps my body more compact and flexible\n- Better long-term positioning?\n\n**LET'S THINK ABOUT THE BIG PICTURE:**\n- I'm at (9, 3), enemy is at (5, 7) - they're trapped in upper-left\n- The right side of the board has TONS of apples: (9, 7), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 7), (7, 1)...\n- I need to CONTROL this apple-rich territory\n- Moving LEFT gets me the immediate point AND moves me toward more apples\n\n**VERDICT:**\n\nGoing LEFT to (8, 3) is the PLAY! \ud83c\udfb0\ud83c\udfb0\ud83c\udfb0\n\n- I grab that FREE APPLE at (8, 3) and we're EQUALIZING on the scoreboard!\n- After eating, my body will be [(8, 3), (9, 3)] - perfect positioning\n- From there I can continue LEFT toward the (7, 1) apple OR go UP toward the (8, 7) motherlode\n- I'm DOMINATING the right side while enemy is stuck playing defense in the corner\n- This is AGGRESSIVE SNAKE, baby! Let's eat!\n\nThe apple is RIGHT THERE. We came to COMPETE, not play timid! Let's GET THIS BREAD! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcb0\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**\nAfter eating the (8, 3) apple, I'll assess:\n- If I go UP \u2192 (8, 4), I'm heading toward (8, 7) and (9, 7)\n- If I go LEFT \u2192 (7, 3), I'm heading toward (7, 1)\n- Either way, I'm feasting on right-side apples!\n\nLEFT",

Looks juicy!\n*   (5,2) - FARTHER DOWN.\n*   (0,6) - WAY TO THE LEFT.\n\n**OPPONENT CHECK:** \ud83d\udc0d\nSnake #1 is on the right edge. Their head is at (8,3). They might go UP towards the apple at (8,7) or (9,7). They might even go LEFT to (7,3). If they go LEFT, they're moving away from us. They are NOT a direct threat this turn.

The apple at (0,6) is far, and we'd be moving along the top, which might limit options later. Not ideal.\n*   **GOING RIGHT (6,6):** This moves us CLOSER to the apple at (6,4) and TOWARDS OUR OPPONENT'S TERRITORY! This is AGGRESSIVE! We could start pressuring them sooner. From (6,6), we can go DOWN to (6,5) next turn to snag that apple.\n\nCHAT, THIS IS THE MOMENT! DO WE PLAY IT SAFE AND CENTRAL WITH **DOWN**? OR DO WE GET AGGRESSIVE AND START THE PUSH WITH **RIGHT**? \ud83e\udd14\n\nI'M FEELING AGGRESSIVE! LET'S START CUTTING THE BOARD IN HALF!

Let me analyze this position CAREFULLY because we're going up against a 2-apple opponent and I need to DOMINATE this board!\n\n## \ud83d\udccd Current Situation\n\n**My Position:**\n- Head: (8, 3)\n- Body: [(9, 3)]\n- Score: 1 apple (we're HUNGRY for more!)\n\n**Enemy Position:**\n- Head: (5, 6)\n- Body: [(5, 7), (5, 8)]\n- Score: 2 apples (they've got a head start, but NOT for long!)\n\nLooking at the board, I'm positioned nicely on the RIGHT SIDE where there are TONS of apples! The enemy is trapped in the upper-left corner with limited mobility - this is PERFECT for boxing them in!\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Move Analysis from (8, 3)\n\n**UP \u2192 (8, 4):**\n- \u2705 No collision with anything\n- \u2705 Apple at (8, 4) - FREE POINT! Let's get this bread! \ud83c\udf4e\n- \u2705 From (8, 4), I have MULTIPLE safe options:\n  - UP to (8, 5) \u2192 heading toward the apple motherlode at (8, 7) and (9, 7)!\n  - RIGHT to (9, 4) \u2192 more right-side control\n  - DOWN to (8, 3) \u2192 back where I came from, but it's an option\n- \u2705 This keeps me in the apple-rich territory while the enemy is stuck in their corner\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (7, 3):**\n- \u2705 Apple at (7, 3) - another free point!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Here's the thing, chat: if I go LEFT, I need to think about the enemy\n- Their head is at (5, 6), so their possible moves are UP to (5, 7) [BLOCKED by their own body!] or LEFT to (4, 6)\n- If they go LEFT to (4, 6), they could potentially come down toward my position\n- Moving UP keeps more distance between us and gives me better long-term positioning\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (8, 2):**\n- \u274c Apple at (8, 2) - wait, no apple there actually\n- From (8, 2), I'd be heading toward apples at (7, 1) and (9, 1)\n- But this moves me DOWN when the BIG apple cluster is UP at rows 7-9\n- Less optimal for maximizing points quickly\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (9, 3):**\n- \u274c That's where my BODY currently is - I'd hit myself! DEATH!\n- Absolutely NOT the move, chat - we came to compete, not to throw!\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Strategic Thinking\n\nLooking at the BIG PICTURE:\n\n**The enemy is BOXED IN:**\n- Head at (5, 6), body going up to (5, 8)\n- They can only go LEFT (to 4, 6) or DOWN (to 5, 5)\n- Their mobility is SEVERELY restricted!\n\n**I'm DOMINATING the right side:**\n- Apples EVERYWHERE on the right: (9, 7), (8, 7), (9, 1), (7, 1), (9, 0)\n- I have space to maneuver and grow\n- The enemy can't easily reach this side without exposing themselves\n\n**The play is CLEAR:** I need to move UP toward the apple motherlode while maintaining my positional advantage!\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf THE PLAY: UP TO (8, 4)!\n\nMoving UP to (8, 4) is the PERFECT move because:\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE REWARD:** I grab the apple at (8, 4) and get +1 point, TIED with the enemy!\n\n2. **POSITIONING:** From (8, 4), I'm ONE MOVE away from (8, 5), which puts me on the doorstep of the (8, 7) and (9, 7) apple jackpot!\n\n3. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** After eating at (8, 4), my body will be [(8, 4), (9, 3)] - perfectly positioned to:\n   - Continue UP to (8, 5) for more apples\n   - Go RIGHT to (9, 4) for right-side control\n   - Even drop DOWN if needed\n\n4. **ENEMY PRESSURE:** By moving UP, I'm increasing the distance while the enemy is stuck in their corner. I'm controlling the board!\n\n5. **SAFETY:** No collision risks, no head-on collision dangers - just CLEAN, SAFE, AGGRESSIVE play!\n\n## \ud83d\udccb Next Few Turns\n\n**TURN 6 (after eating at 8, 4):**\n- Move UP to (8, 5) - heading toward the big apple cluster!\n\n**TURN 7:**\n- Move UP to (8, 6) or (8, 7) - FEAST MODE activated! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**TURN 8+:**\n- Keep eating right-side apples while the enemy struggles to escape their corner\n- Maintain pressure and keep them boxed in\n- Score will PILE UP and we'll leave them in the dust!\n\nLet's GOOO! We're eating WELL tonight, chat! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcb0\n\n**PLAN:** Move UP to (8, 4), grab that apple, then continue UP toward (8, 7) and (9, 7) to DOMINATE the right side of the board!\n\nUP",

We're going to TIE this enemy with 2 apples!\n- \u2705 From (9, 4), I've got OPTIONS:\n  - UP to (9, 5) \u2192 heading toward (9, 7)!\n  - DOWN to (9, 3) \u2192 more right-side control\n  - LEFT to (8, 4) \u2192 back where I came from\n- \u2705 This keeps me FIRMLY in control of the right side\n- \u2705 MAXIMIZES distance from enemy who's stuck on the left\n\n**UP \u2192 (8, 5):**\n- \u274c No apple there unfortunately\n- \u2705 Would move me toward (8, 7) apple\n- \u26a0\ufe0f But wait - if enemy goes UP to (6, 7), we'd both be moving UP the board\n- \u26a0\ufe0f The enemy could potentially block my path or create a head-on collision scenario\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Less ideal than staying on the far right\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (7, 4):**\n- \u2705 Apple at (7, 4) - that's another free point!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Moves me slightly left, closer to the enemy's general area\n- \u2705 Still not bad, but RIGHT gives me better territorial control\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (8, 3):**\n- \u274c That's where my BODY currently is - I'd hit myself! DEATH!\n- Absolutely NOT the move, chat - we're better than that!\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Enemy Analysis - What Are They Going To Do?\n\nThe enemy is at (6, 6) with body [(5, 6), (5, 7)]. Let's see their options:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (6, 7):** This looks like their BEST move! From (6, 7), they could potentially move toward the (8, 7) apple or escape their corner more.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5, 6):** BLOCKED by their own body at (5, 6)! DEATH!\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6, 5):** This is open, but it moves them AWAY from the apple-rich areas. Not their best play.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7, 6):** Open, but then they might run into our territory or the apple at (6, 4).\n\nThe enemy will almost certainly go UP to (6, 7). That's their best escape route.\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Strategic Decision\n\nHere's the THING, chat - the enemy going to (6, 7) is actually PERFECT for us!\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 4), I'm:\n1. **GRABBING that apple** and tying the score at 2-2\n2. **CONTROLLING the far right** where the enemy CAN'T reach me\n3. **SETTING UP** to hit (9, 7) and (8, 7) in the next few turns\n4. **MAINTAINING MAXIMUM DISTANCE** from the enemy - they're on the left, I'm on the right\n\nIf I go UP to (8, 5), I'd be:\n1. Moving TOWARD where the enemy wants to go\n2. Potentially creating a collision course or at least reducing my options\n3. Less safe overall\n\nThe RIGHT side of the board is OURS, chat! We've got apples at (9, 4), (9, 7), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 1) - that's a GOLD MINE! The enemy is stuck on the left side with limited mobility.\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf THE PLAY: RIGHT TO (9, 4)! \n\nMoving RIGHT to (9, 4) is DOMINANT because:\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE REWARD:** +1 apple, we're now TIED at 2 apples each! Content right there! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n2. **TERRITORIAL CONTROL:** We're claiming the far right corner - the enemy literally cannot reach us here without a long, vulnerable journey\n\n3. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** From (9, 4), we can:\n   - Continue UP to (9, 5), then (9, 6), then (9, 7) for that HUGE apple cluster!\n   - Go DOWN to (9, 3) for bottom-right control\n   - Loop around if needed\n\n4. **ENEMY PRESSURE:** By staying far right, we're forcing the enemy to either:\n   - Try to cross the ENTIRE board to reach us (risky!)\n   - Stay on the left and fight for scraps\n   - Either way, WE control the narrative!\n\n5. **SAFETY:** No collision risks, the enemy is 3+ cells away, we're in the open apple territory!\n\nLet's EAT, chat! We're about to leave this enemy in the dust! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcb0\n\n**PLAN:** Move RIGHT to (9, 4) to grab that apple, then continue UP the right side toward (9, 7) and (8, 7) to MAXIMIZE our apple collection while the enemy struggles to escape their corner!\n\nRIGHT",

Where can they go?\n*   Their UP: (8,5) - Empty \u2705\n*   Their DOWN: (8,3) - \ud83d\udea8 ITS OWN BODY! \u274c So they CANNOT go DOWN.\n*   Their LEFT: (7,4) - Empty \u2705\n*   Their RIGHT: (9,4) - Empty \u2705\n\nSo their **ONLY DEATH MOVE IS DOWN**. They can go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?** \ud83e\udd1d\ud83d\udca5\nIf we go RIGHT to (7,6), where are they going? They can't reach us.

WE NEED TO START BOXING HIM IN FOR REAL! HE'S STUCK ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BOARD. WE NEED TO CUT OFF HIS ESCAPE ROUTES TO THE CENTER AND LEFT!\n\n*   **GOING UP (6,7):** This moves us towards the top. It's safe but doesn't put immediate pressure on our rival. It feels a bit passive. Not the play.\n*   **GOING DOWN (6,5):** THIS IS THE MOVE! This moves us towards the apple at (6,4) and DEEPER INTO THE CENTER! From (6,5), we can control the board. We can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN next turn to grab that apple. This strengthens our center control and starts to cut the board in half between us and the opponent! THIS IS HOW WE START THE BOX!\n*   **GOING RIGHT (7,6):** This moves us TOWARDS the opponent. But it's a bit early to get that close. We're still small. We need to get bigger and control more space before we get aggressive. This move could risk getting pinned against the right wall ourselves if we're not careful. Too risky right now!\n\nCHAT, IT'S ALL ABOUT BOARD CONTROL! WE TAKE THE CENTER, WE WIN THE GAME! LET'S NOT GET GREEDY! LET'S PLAY SMART AND STRONG!\n\nTHE MOVE IS **DOWN**! LET'S GO FOR THAT APPLE AND DOMINATE THE MAP!\n\nDOWN",

Look at all these apple locations on our side:\n\n- (9, 7) - UP from us! \ud83c\udf4e\n- (8, 7) - diagonal opportunity! \ud83c\udf4e\n- (8, 8) - even MORE apples! \ud83c\udf4e\n- (9, 1) and (9, 0) - bottom right treasures! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nThe enemy is stuck on the left side with their head at (6, 5) and body wrapping around. They've got limited options and are basically trapped in a corner! This is PERFECT for us - we've got the territorial advantage, the mobility advantage, and soon we're gonna have the SCORE advantage too!\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 ENEMY MOVEMENT PREDICTION\n\nLet me figure out what the enemy is gonna do from (6, 5):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (6, 6):** BLOCKED! Their own body is there! DEATH!\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5, 5):** Would move them further left, away from everything\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6, 4):** OPEN - this is their safest bet, but it's moving AWAY from the action\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7, 5):** OPEN - would move them slightly toward our territory\n\nSo the enemy will probably go DOWN to (6, 4) or RIGHT to (7, 5). Either way, they're not threatening us right now - we're safe and STRATEGICALLY POSITIONED!\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf MY POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (9, 4)\n\n**UP \u2192 (9, 5):**\n- \u2705 Positions us to continue UP toward (9, 7) apple!\n- \u2705 Keeps us FIRMLY on the right side - territorial control!\n- \u2705 From (9, 5), we maintain options:\n  - Continue UP to (9, 6) then (9, 7) for that CLUSTER of apples!\n  - Go DOWN to (9, 4) if needed\n  - We're dominant and flexible!\n- \u2705 SAFETY: No collision risks, enemy is far away on the left!\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (9, 3):**\n- \u274c Moves us DOWN and AWAY from the apple-rich upper right!\n- \u2705 Would give us a longer vertical corridor potentially\n- \u26a0\ufe0f But we're giving up our STRATEGIC HIGH GROUND!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f We'd be moving away from the main apple cluster at (9, 7) and (8, 7)!\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (8, 4):**\n- \u274c BLOCKED! That's where our BODY currently is!\n- \u274c DEATH - moving backward into ourselves!\n- \u274c ABSOLUTELY NOT - we're better than that!\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (9, 5):**\n- \u274c WAIT - we're already at x=9, the RIGHTMOST column!\n- \u274c Moving RIGHT would take us OFF THE BOARD!\n- \u274c INSTANT DEATH - we're done!\n\n## \ud83c\udfc6 STRATEGIC DECISION\n\nListen chat, this is a NO BRAINER - we gotta go UP to (9, 5)!\n\nHere's why this is the DOMINANT move:\n\n1. **POSITIONAL DOMINANCE:** (9, 5) keeps us on the far right where we've got ALL THE APPLES! The enemy literally cannot reach us here without crossing the entire board!\n\n2. **APPLE ACCESS:** From (9, 5), we're ONE MOVE AWAY from (9, 6), and then BOOM - (9, 7) is OURS! That apple cluster at (9, 7), (8, 7), and (8, 8) is basically FREE MONEY at this point!\n\n3. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** Moving UP keeps multiple paths open:\n   - Continue UP the right wall toward the apple jackpot\n   - Branch off horizontally if needed\n   - We've got maximum flexibility!\n\n4. **ENEMY PRESSURE:** By staying on the right, we're forcing the enemy to either:\n   - Try to cross the entire dangerous board to reach us (they'll die trying!)\n   - Stay on the scraps on the left side while we DOMINATE the apple-rich right side!\n\n5. **SAFETY FIRST:** No collision risks, no body contacts, the enemy is 3+ cells away - this is the SAFEST move that also MAXIMIZES our potential!\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf THE PLAY: UP TO (9, 5)!\n\nMoving UP to (9, 5) is PURE SKILL because:\n\n1. We're CONTINUING our DOMINANCE on the right side!\n2. We're SETTING UP to absolutely FEAST on those upper-right apples!\n3. We're keeping the enemy TRAPPED on the left side with limited options!\n4. We're maintaining MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY for future turns!\n5. We're playing SMART and STRATEGIC - that's how CHAMPIONS win!\n\nLet's GO chat! We're about to LEAVE this enemy in the dust and take the LEAD! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udc0d\n\n**STRATEGIC PLAN FOR FUTURE:**\n- Turn 7: UP to (9, 5)\n- Turn 8: UP to (9, 6) \n- Turn 9: UP to (9, 7) - GRAB THAT APPLE!\n- Then continue toward (8, 7) and (8, 8) to ABSOLUTELY MAXIMIZE our apple collection!\n- The enemy can't stop us - we're playing SNAKE like a GRANDMASTER!\n\nRIGHT!

Wait, checking the board... no, (6, 5) has a \"T\" marking body, but I need to double-check if it's theirs or ours... Looking at the board, enemy body is [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6)], so UP is BLOCKED by their own body! DEATH!\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5, 4):** OPEN - would move them further left into nothingness\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6, 3):** OPEN - safe but moves them down and away\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7, 4):** OPEN - this is their BEST option, moves toward center\n\nSo enemy will likely go RIGHT to (7, 4) or DOWN to (6, 3). Either way, they're NOT threatening our apple-rich territory!\n\n## \ud83c\udf4e MY APPLE STRATEGY\n\nLooking at the board, we have a GOLDMINE of apples on our side:\n\n- (9, 7) - UP from us! \ud83c\udf4e\n- (8, 7) - LEFT from (9, 7)! \ud83c\udf4e  \n- (8, 8) - UP from (8, 7)! \ud83c\udf4e\n- (9, 1) and (9, 0) - bottom right treasures! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nThese upper-right apples at (9, 7), (8, 7), and (8, 8) are literally calling our name!\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf MY POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (9, 5)\n\n**UP \u2192 (9, 6):**\n- \u2705 Positions us to continue UP toward (9, 7) apple!\n- \u2705 MAINTAINS our STRATEGIC DOMINANCE on the right wall!\n- \u2705 From (9, 6), we can:\n  - Continue UP to (9, 7) for that DELICIOUS apple!\n  - We've got maximum flexibility and territorial control!\n- \u2705 SAFETY: Enemy is at (6, 4), they can't reach us here!\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (9, 4):**\n- \u274c Moves us DOWN and into our OWN BODY at (9, 4)!\n- \u274c INSTANT DEATH - cannot move backward into ourselves!\n- \u274c ABSOLUTELY NOT - we're smarter than that!\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (8, 5):**\n- \u2705 Could work, but this moves us AWAY from the right wall\n- \u2705 We'd be surrendering our STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE\n- \u274c More vulnerable to enemy approaching from left\n- \u274c We'd be giving up our dominant positioning!\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (9, 6):**\n- \u274c Wait, we're at x=9, the RIGHTMOST column!\n- \u274c Moving RIGHT would take us OFF THE BOARD!\n- \u274c INSTANT DEATH - we're done!\n\n## \ud83c\udfc6 STRATEGIC DECISION\n\nListen chat, this is EASY - we gotta go UP to (9, 6)! \n\nHere's why this is the DOMINANT move:\n\n1. **POSITIONAL DOMINANCE:** (9, 6) keeps us FIRMLY on the far right wall where we've got ALL THE APPLES! The enemy literally cannot reach us here!\n\n2. **APPLE ACCESS:** From (9, 6), we're ONE MOVE AWAY from (9, 7) and that APPLE! The cluster at (9, 7), (8, 7), and (8, 8) is FREE MONEY!\n\n3. **FUTURE OPTIONS:** Moving UP keeps multiple paths open:\n   - Continue UP to (9, 7) - EAT THE APPLE!\n   - We're maintaining maximum flexibility!\n\n4. **ENEMY PRESSURE:** By staying on the right, we're forcing the enemy to stay on scraps while we FEAST!\n\n5. **SAFETY FIRST:** No collision risks, the enemy is 3+ cells away - this is the SAFEST move!\n\n## \ud83d\udccb STRATEGIC PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:\n\n- **Turn 8:** UP to (9, 6) - Continue our DOMINANCE!\n- **Turn 9:** UP to (9, 7) - GRAB THAT APPLE! +1 score!\n- **Turn 10:** LEFT to (8, 7) - Collect another apple! +1 score!\n- **Turn 11:** UP to (8, 8) - Finish the cluster! +1 score!\n- **Turn 12+:** Continue DOMINATING the right side, eating apples, and watching the enemy struggle!\n\nBy sticking to this RIGHT WALL STRATEGY, we're going to absolutely FEAST on those upper-right apples while the enemy is trapped on the left with limited options!

FROM (7,5), OUR NEXT MOVE SHOULD BE TO GO RIGHT TO (8,5) TO SOLIDIFY THE TRAP! IF HE GOES UP TO (9,7) TO EAT THE APPLE, HE'S EVEN MORE TRAPPED! STAY AGGRESSIVE! THE BOX IS ALMOST SHUT!\n\nUP",

Let's GOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25 We're LIVE at turn 10 and it's time to make some PLAYS! \n\n**\ud83d\udccd WHERE WE AT THO:**\n\nAlright, so looking at the board after my last move:\n- **MY HEAD:** (9, 7) - DOMINATING the right wall like a boss! \ud83d\udcaa\n- **MY BODY:** [(9, 6), (9, 5)] - Compact, deadly, ready to strike!\n- **ENEMY:** Head at (7, 5) with body [(7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5)] - They're stuck on the left side struggling!\n\n**\ud83c\udf4e THE APPLE SITUATION:**\n\nWe got CLUSTERS of apples everywhere chat! Let me break this down:\n- **Upper-right cluster:** (8, 8), (8, 7) - These are calling our name!\n- **Right wall treasures:** (9, 1), (9, 0) - More snacks for days!\n- **Enemy side:** They got access to (7, 1) and (4, 5) - but we're hogging the GOOD stuff!\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf MY OPTIONS FROM (9, 7):**\n\nLet's analyze each direction systematically:\n\n**UP \u2192 (9, 8):**\n- \u274c BOARD EDGE! y=8 is the top, so UP goes to (9, 8)... wait no, let me check. The board goes 0-9, so UP from (9, 7) would be (9, 8)... but that IS on the board. Wait, let me double-check the board display...\n\nActually wait, looking at the board:\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . A .\n```\n\nRow 8 has an apple at (8, 8), so (8, 8) is valid. But what's at (9, 8)? Looking at row 8, the last position (x=9) is empty based on the dots. So UP to (9, 8) is SAFE and EMPTY.\n\nBut here's the PROBLEM with UP: from (9, 8), what are my next moves?\n- UP \u2192 (9, 9) - that's the TOP-RIGHT corner!\n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 8) - has an apple!\n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 7) - back where I came from\n- RIGHT \u2192 OFF BOARD (x=10) - DEATH!\n\nSo from (9, 8), I'd have limited options, and getting to (8, 8) still requires moving LEFT anyway. UP doesn't really help me access apples faster.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (10, 7):**\n- \u274c OFF THE BOARD! x=10 doesn't exist!\n- \u274c INSTANT DEATH - we're donezo!\n- \u274c ABSOLUTELY NOT - chat we're not throwing this!\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (9, 6):**\n- \u274c That's my OWN BODY! [(9, 6)] is literally in my body list!\n- \u274c Moving into myself = INSTANT DEATH\n- \u274c Never do this, it's basic snake 101!\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (8, 7):**\n- \u2705 SAFE - empty cell according to the board\n- \u2705 Has an APPLE at (8, 7)! \ud83c\udf4e FREE POINT!\n- \u2705 Positions me to access the upper-right apple cluster\n- \u2705 From (8, 7), I can go UP to (8, 8) for another apple! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- \u2705 Keeps multiple escape routes open for future turns\n- \u2705 Stays on the right wall where we DOMINATE!\n\n**\ud83e\udd14 STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n\nHere's the thing chat - we gotta think a few moves ahead. If I go UP to (9, 8), I'm in the corner and my options get restricted. But if I go LEFT to (8, 7):\n\n**Path 1: LEFT to (8, 7) \u2192 UP to (8, 8)**\n- Turn 10: (8, 7) - GRAB APPLE! +1 score! Total: 3 apples! \ud83d\udd25\n- Turn 11: (8, 8) - GRAB APPLE! +1 score! Total: 4 apples! \ud83d\udcb0\n\n**From there?** At (8, 8):\n- Can go LEFT to (7, 8)\n- Can go DOWN back toward our territory\n- Multiple options available!\n\n**Path 2: UP to (9, 8) first**\n- Turn 10: (9, 8) - no apple, just positioning\n- Turn 11: LEFT to (8, 8) - GRAB APPLE! +1 score\n\nThis takes LONGER to get the same apple! We're wasting a turn when we could be SCORING!\n\n**\ud83c\udfc6 WHY LEFT IS THE DOMINANT PLAY:**\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE VALUE:** (8, 7) has an apple! We score NOW, not later!\n\n2. **CLUSTER ACCESS:** Gets us into the upper-right apple zone - (8, 7), (8, 8), all that goodness is OURS!\n\n3. **TERRITORY CONTROL:** We're still dominating the right wall, enemy can't touch us here!\n\n4. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:** From (8, 7), we can:\n   - Go UP to (8, 8) for more apples!\n   - Go LEFT to (7, 7) for exploration!\n   - Go DOWN if we need to retreat!\n   - Come back RIGHT if we want!\n\n5. **ENEMY IGNORANCE:** Snake 0 is stuck at (7, 5) with limited mobility. They literally cannot reach our territory. We're playing a completely different game over here!\n\n**\ud83d\udccb GAME PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n\n- **Turn 10 (NOW):** LEFT to (8, 7) - EAT THAT APPLE! +1 score!\n- **Turn 11:** UP to (8, 8) - EAT ANOTHER APPLE! +1 score!\n- **Turn 12+:** Continue feasting on the upper-right cluster, then work our way down the right wall toward (9, 1) and (9, 0)!\n\nWe're going to absolutely FEAST while the enemy is trapped on the left with their 3 measly apples! Our 2 will become 3, then 4, then 5... we're coming for that lead chat! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf THE CALL: LEFT TO (8, 7)!**\n\nThis is PURE SKILL and STRATEGIC PLAYING! We're taking what's OURS and making smart moves that set us up for DOMINATION! The apple at (8,7) is literally waiting for us, and this move keeps all our future options OPEN while scoring us points!\n\nLet's GET this bread! \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\n\nLEFT",

WHAT'S THE BEST MOVE?\n\n*   **GOING UP (7,6):** \u2705 Moves us NORTH. Puts us in a good central position. An apple is at (8,7) but that's where the enemy IS. Next turn from (7,6): We could go UP, RIGHT, or LEFT. GOOD OPTIONS.\n\n*   **GOING RIGHT (8,5):** \u2705 THIS IS THE AGGRESSIVE MOVE, CHAT! \ud83d\udd25 THIS DIRECTLY BLOCKS THE ENEMY'S PATH SOUTH! From (8,5), we are directly between them and the bottom half of the board! Next turn from (8,5): We could go UP to (8,6) to FURTHER block them, RIGHT to (9,5), or DOWN to (8,4). SOLID POSITIONING!\n\n**THE CHOICE:** GOING RIGHT IS THE MOVE! IT'S AGGRESSIVE, IT CUTS OFF THE BOARD, AND IT KEEPS US SAFE! LET'S GO!\n\n**TO MY FUTURE SELF:** \ud83d\udc8c\nWE'VE MOVED RIGHT TO (8,5)! THE ENEMY IS AT (8,7)!

Let's review the current situation:\n- **MY HEAD:** (8, 7) - We're FEEDING chat! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **MY BODY:** [(9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5)] - Compact and deadly!\n- **ENEMY:** Head at (8, 5) with body [(7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4)] - They're still stuck on the left struggling!\n\n**\ud83c\udf4e THE APPLE SITUATION:**\n\nWe got OPTIONS chat! Let me break down what's available:\n- **Immediate apple:** (8, 8) is RIGHT ABOVE US! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Upper-right cluster:** (7, 8), (6, 8) - all empty and waiting!\n- **Right wall treasures:** (9, 1), (9, 0) - more snacks for later!\n- **Enemy side:** They got some apples but they literally can't reach our territory!\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf MY OPTIONS FROM (8, 7):**\n\nLet's analyze each direction systematically:\n\n**UP \u2192 (8, 8):**\n- \u2705 SAFE - empty cell according to the board\n- \u2705 Has an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e FREE POINT!\n- \u2705 Positions us to access the upper row\n- \u2705 From (8, 8), we can go LEFT to (7, 8) for another apple!\n- \u2705 OR go DOWN back toward our body if needed\n- \u2705 Multiple escape routes maintained!\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (9, 7):**\n- \u274c That's our OWN BODY! [(9, 7)] is literally our first body segment!\n- \u274c Moving into ourselves = INSTANT DEATH\n- \u274c Never do this, basic snake 101!\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (9, 6):**\n- \u274c That's our OWN BODY! [(9, 6)] is literally in our body list!\n- \u274c Moving into ourselves = INSTANT DEATH\n- \u274c ABSOLUTELY NOT chat we're not throwing this!\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (8, 6):**\n- \u2705 SAFE - empty cell according to the board\n- \u274c NO APPLE here\n- \u274c This moves us LEFT, away from our body cluster\n- \u274c From (8, 6), where do we go?\n  - UP \u2192 (8, 7) - back where we came from\n  - LEFT \u2192 (7, 6) - empty but no immediate reward\n  - DOWN \u2192 (9, 6) - INTO OUR BODY - DEATH!\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (9, 6) - INTO OUR BODY - DEATH!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Limited options if we go here!\n\n**\ud83e\udd14 STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n\nHere's the play chat - we gotta think a few moves ahead! If we go LEFT to (8, 6):\n\n**The PROBLEM:** From (8, 6), DOWN and RIGHT are both blocked by our own body! We're essentially trapped in a corner with only UP and LEFT available. That's BAD future flexibility!\n\n**The SOLUTION:** UP to (8, 8) gives us:\n- **IMMEDIATE VALUE:** We eat an apple NOW! +1 score! Total: 4 apples! \ud83d\udd25\n- **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:** From (8, 8), we can:\n  - LEFT to (7, 8) - another apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n  - DOWN to (8, 7) - back toward our territory\n  - RIGHT to (9, 8) - exploration option!\n- **POSITIONAL ADVANTAGE:** We're staying in the upper-right where we DOMINATE!\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\n\nSnake 0 is at (8, 5) with body [(7, 5), (7, 4), (6, 4)]. Where can THEY go?\n\nAvailable moves from (8, 5):\n- UP \u2192 (8, 6) - would move into our potential path\n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 4) - empty\n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 5) - INTO THEIR OWN BODY - DEATH!\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 5) - empty\n\nThey're pretty restricted too! They can't reach our territory, so we're playing our own game over here!\n\n**\ud83d\udccb GAME PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n\n- **Turn 11 (NOW):** UP to (8, 8) - EAT THAT APPLE! +1 score!\n- **Turn 12:** LEFT to (7, 8) - EAT ANOTHER APPLE! +1 score!\n- **Turn 13+:** Continue feasting on the upper row or work our way down the right wall!\n\nWe're going to absolutely FEAST while the enemy is trapped on the left with their 3 measly apples! Our 3 is about to become 4, then 5... we're coming for that lead chat! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**\ud83c\udfc6 WHY UP IS THE DOMINANT PLAY:**\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE VALUE:** (8, 8) has an apple! We score NOW, not later!\n\n2. **CLUSTER ACCESS:** We're already in the upper-right zone, and UP keeps us there!\n\n3. **TERRITORY CONTROL:** We're still dominating the right wall, enemy can't touch us here!\n\n4. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:** From (8, 8), we keep multiple escape routes open!\n\n5. **ENEMY IGNORANCE:** Snake 0 is stuck at (8, 5) with limited mobility. They literally cannot reach our territory. We're playing a completely different game over here!\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf THE CALL: UP TO (8, 8)!**\n\nThis is PURE SKILL and STRATEGIC PLAYING! We're taking what's OURS and making smart moves that set us up for DOMINATION! The apple at (8, 8) is literally waiting for us, and this move keeps all our future options OPEN while scoring us points!\n\nLet's GET this bread! \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\n\nUP",

The right wall is basically a DEAD END for us right now:\n\n**The PROBLEM with RIGHT to (9, 8):**\n- We'd be stuck in the corner\n- Can't go UP (off board)\n- Can't go DOWN (into our body)\n- Only option is back LEFT to (8, 8)\n- That's BACKWARDS movement - no progress, no apples!\n\n**The SOLUTION with LEFT to (7, 8):**\n- **IMMEDIATE VALUE:** We eat an apple NOW! +1 score! Total: 5 apples! \ud83d\udd25\n- **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:** From (7, 8), we can:\n  - LEFT to (6, 8) - another apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n  - DOWN to (7, 7) - exploration option!\n  - Continue moving toward the upper-left apple cluster\n- **TERRITORY EXPANSION:** We're breaking into new areas with tons of apples!\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\n\nSnake 0 is at (8, 6) with body [(8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 4)].

But wait - if we go LEFT to (7, 8), they can't reach us anyway. We're playing on different sides of the board!\n\nActually wait, let me check if they could move to (9, 5) which would block our future RIGHT moves...\n\n**THE CRITICAL QUESTION: Where does the enemy move this turn?**\n\nFrom (8, 6):\n- UP \u2192 (8, 7) - INTO OUR BODY - DEATH!\n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 5) - INTO THEIR OWN BODY - DEATH!\n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 6) - empty\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 6) - empty\n\nSo they can go LEFT to (7, 6) or RIGHT to (9, 6). Let me think...\n\nIf they go RIGHT to (9, 6), they're basically copying our position from last turn. And their body would shift to [(8, 6), (8, 5), (7, 5)] - they keep moving right.\n\nThis means (9, 5) would be EMPTY and available for us in future turns! That means we could potentially go RIGHT later and get more right-wall apples!\n\nSo even if they occupy (9, 6), our LEFT move to (7, 8) is still SAFE and STRATEGIC because:\n1. We get an apple NOW\n2. We open up the left side with tons of apples\n3. We maintain access to the right wall for later\n4. We're staying far away from the enemy\n\n**\ud83d\udccb GAME PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n\n- **Turn 12 (NOW):** LEFT to (7, 8) - EAT THAT APPLE! +1 score!\n- **Turn 13:** LEFT to (6, 8) - EAT ANOTHER APPLE! +1 score!\n- **Turn 14+:** Continue feasting on the upper-left cluster!\n- **Future:** When we want to come back to the right wall, we can navigate back through the upper row!\n\nWe're going to ABSOLUTELY FEAST while the enemy is stuck with their 3 measly apples! Our 4 is about to become 5, then 6... we're extending our lead chat! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**\ud83c\udfc6 WHY LEFT IS THE DOMINANT PLAY:**\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE VALUE:** (7, 8) has an apple! We score NOW, not later!\n\n2. **CLUSTER ACCESS:** We're breaking into the upper-left apple goldmine!\n\n3. **STRATEGIC EXPANSION:** We're not just staying in one corner - we're CONTROLLING THE BOARD!\n\n4. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:** From (7, 8), we keep multiple escape routes and apple access!\n\n5. **ENEMY SEPARATION:** Snake 0 can't reach our territory. We're playing our own game and WINNING it!\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf THE CALL: LEFT TO (7, 8)!**\n\nThis is PURE SKILL and STRATEGIC DOMINATION!

LET'S GET THIS PAPER! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\n**\ud83d\udccd CURRENT SITUATION:**\n\nAlright, we're LIVE at Turn 13 and we just ATE that apple at (7, 8) last turn - THAT'S OUR 5TH APPLE BABY! We're DOMINATING with a 2-apple lead! \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\n\nLet me break down where we're at:\n- **MY HEAD:** (7, 8) - Still in the upper-right corner but we moved LEFT last turn\n- **MY BODY:** [(8, 8), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6)] - Stretched along the right wall\n- **ENEMY:** Head at (7, 6) with body [(8, 6), (8, 5), (7, 5)] - They're stuck below us!\n\n**\ud83c\udf4e THE APPLE SITUATION:**\n\nLooking at the board, we got TONS of options chat! Our apple list shows plenty of targets:\n- **Immediate area:** (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8) all ABOVE us!\n- **Upper-left cluster:** (4, 8), (3, 7), (1, 7), (4, 6), (1, 3) and more!\n- **Left wall:** (0, 6), (0, 4), (0, 2) - Lots of vertical apple action!\n- **Lower areas:** (2, 0), (5, 2) and others scattered around\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf MY OPTIONS FROM (7, 8):**\n\nLet me analyze systematically what moves keep us alive:\n\n**UP \u2192 (7, 9):**\n- \u274c OFF THE BOARD! Can't go off board chat, that's instant death!\n- \u274c Never an option from y=8, basic survival!\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (7, 7):**\n- \u2705 SAFE - empty cell according to the board\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Close to enemy at (7, 6) - this is their UP destination!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f If they move UP to (7, 7) and I move DOWN to (7, 7)... BOTH DIE in a head-on collision!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Even if we don't collide, we're right next to each other - tense situation!\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (8, 8):**\n- \u2705 SAFE - that's where our tail segment is... wait no, the tail moves\n- \u2705 Would move us back toward our body trail\n- \u274c NO APPLE here\n- \u274c This is basically BACKWARDS movement - we're retreating from the apple cluster!\n- \u274c From (8, 8), we'd have limited options - can't go RIGHT (off board at x=9)\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (6, 8):**\n- \u2705 SAFE - empty cell according to the board\n- \u2705 Positions us for the upper apple cluster!\n- \u2705 From (6, 8), we have MULTIPLE options:\n  - UP \u2192 (6, 9) - more board to explore!\n  - LEFT \u2192 (5, 8) - another apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n  - DOWN \u2192 (6, 7) - exploration option!\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (7, 8) - back if needed\n- \u2705 Multiple escape routes maintained!\n- \u2705 We're moving TOWARD the apple-rich upper-left region!\n\n**\ud83e\udd14 STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n\nHere's what I'm seeing chat - we gotta think a few moves ahead!\n\n**The PROBLEM with DOWN to (7, 7):**\n- We'd be RIGHT NEXT TO THE ENEMY at (7, 6)!\n- They could move UP to (7, 7) - that's a HEAD-ON COLLISION and we'd BOTH DIE!\n- Even if they don't move there, we're in a tense standoff situation\n- Our apple access from (7, 7) is limited - we're kind of stuck between the enemy and the wall\n\n**The PROBLEM with RIGHT to (8, 8):**\n- This is RETREATING! We just came from there!\n- No immediate apple value\n- Limited future options - we're going back toward our own body\n- We're moving AWAY from the apple clusters\n\n**The SOLUTION with LEFT to (6, 8):**\n- **IMMEDIATE VALUE:** We get closer to the upper apple cluster! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n- **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:** From (6, 8), we can go UP, LEFT, or DOWN - tons of options!\n- **ENEMY SEPARATION:** We increase distance from the enemy at (7, 6)\n- **STRATEGIC PRESSURE:** We're threatening to cut off their access to the upper area!\n- **CLUSTER ACCESS:** We're moving toward (5, 8), (4, 8), etc. - the apple goldmine!\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\n\nWhere can Snake 0 at (7, 6) go this turn?\n\nAvailable moves from (7, 6):\n- UP \u2192 (7, 7) - empty, but we'd collide if I went there!\n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 5) - empty\n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 6) - empty\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 6) - that's their own body! DEATH!\n\nSo they can go UP to (7, 7), DOWN to (7, 5), or LEFT to (6, 6).\n\n**The KEY QUESTION: Where do they move?**\n\nIf they go UP to (7, 7):\n- They try to get closer to our position\n- But they can't reach us from (7, 7) - we'd be at (6, 8)\n- We'd have the advantage of threatening to block them\n\nIf they go LEFT to (6, 6):\n- They're trying to access the left side\n- This puts them further from the upper apples\n- We're ahead in the race for that cluster!\n\nIf they go DOWN to (7, 5):\n- They're retreating or going lower\n- We're completely winning the positioning battle!\n\nNo matter where they go, our LEFT move to (6, 8) is STRONG because:\n1. We're moving toward apples while they're reacting to us\n2. We maintain distance and avoid head-on collision risk\n3. We're threatening to cut off their upper access\n4. We have more escape routes than they do\n\n**\ud83d\udccb GAME PLAN FOR NEXT FEW TURNS:**\n\n- **Turn 13 (NOW):** LEFT to (6, 8) - Position for the feast!\n- **Turn 14:** LEFT to (5, 8) - Get that apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 15:** LEFT to (4, 8) - ANOTHER apple! \ud83d\udd25\n- **Turn 16+:** Continue through the upper-left cluster!\n- **Future:** When we finish the upper cluster, we can come back down the left wall!\n\nWe're going to ABSOLUTELY FEAST while the enemy is stuck with their 3 measly apples! Our 5 is about to become 6, 7, 8... we're extending our lead chat! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**\ud83c\udfc6 WHY LEFT IS THE DOMINANT PLAY:**\n\n1. **APPLE ACCESS:** We're moving toward the upper-left apple cluster with multiple targets!\n\n2. **ENEMY SEPARATION:** We avoid the dangerous DOWN option that could cause a head-on collision!\n\n3. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:** From (6, 8), we have UP, LEFT, and DOWN available - multiple paths!\n\n4. **STRATEGIC PRESSURE:** We're threatening to block the enemy's access to the upper area!\n\n5. **POSITIONING DOMINANCE:** We maintain the initiative while the enemy reacts to us!\n\n6. **SURVIVAL:** All other options either kill us (UP), risk collision (DOWN), or retreat (RIGHT)!\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf THE CALL: LEFT TO (6, 8)!**\n\nThis is PURE SKILL and STRATEGIC DOMINATION! We're taking the high ground in the apple race, keeping distance from the enemy, and setting up for a MULTI-TURN FEAST! The enemy can't touch us while we're collecting apples in the upper cluster!\n\nLet's GET this bread! \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nContinue LEFT through the upper row to access the apple cluster at (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 7), etc. Meanwhile, the enemy at (7, 6) is stuck below and can't reach those apples without going through our potential blocking positions. We're playing chess while they're playing checkers! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLEFT",

Apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- (2, 9) - Further up and left! Another apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- (1, 8), (1, 7) - Left side loaded with apples! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf MY OPTIONS FROM (4, 8):**\n\nLet me analyze systematically what moves keep us alive:\n\n**UP \u2192 (4, 9):**\n- \u2705 SAFE - empty cell according to the board\n- \u26a0\ufe0f No apple there unfortunately\n- \u26a0\ufe0f From (4, 9), our body would be at [(4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8)]\n- \u26a0\ufe0f This LIMITS our future options - we'd be at the top edge!\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (4, 7):**\n- \u274c IMMEDIATE DEATH! The ENEMY is at (4, 6) DIRECTLY BELOW (4, 7)!\n- \u274c If we move DOWN to (4, 7) and the enemy moves UP to (4, 7)... HEAD-ON COLLISION! BOTH DIE!\n- \u274c NEVER gamble when we have safer options available!\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (5, 8):**\n- \u274c That's where we CAME FROM! That's our body segment at (5, 8)!\n- \u274c Moving backwards into our own body = INSTANT DEATH!\n- \u274c Never an option!\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (3, 8):**\n- \u2705 SAFE - empty cell according to the board\n- \u2705 This POSITIONS US PERFECTLY to go DOWN to (3, 7) for the APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- \u2705 From (3, 8), we'll have tons of options:\n  - DOWN \u2192 (3, 7) - ANOTHER apple! \ud83d\udd25\n  - LEFT \u2192 (2, 8) - more positioning!\n  - UP \u2192 (3, 9) - exploration option!\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (4, 8) - back to safety!\n- \u2705 We're maintaining distance from the enemy below us!\n- \u2705 We're executing our STRATEGIC PLAN perfectly!\n\n**\ud83e\udd14 STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n\nHere's the play-by-play chat - we gotta think a few moves ahead!\n\n**The CRITICAL TIMING with (3, 7):**\n\nThere's an apple at (3, 7) - that's DIRECTLY DOWN and LEFT from our current position! Here's the sequence:\n\n- **Turn 16 (NOW):** LEFT to (3, 8) - Position ourselves ABOVE the apple! \ud83c\udfaf\n- **Turn 17:** DOWN to (3, 7) - EAT THAT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n\nBut here's the thing - we need to get to (3, 8) FIRST before we can go to (3, 7). If we go UP to (4, 9), we'd need to come back LEFT to (3, 9), then DOWN to (3, 8), then DOWN to (3, 7) - that's 3-4 turns just to get to the same position!\n\n**The PROBLEM with DOWN to (4, 7):**\n- The enemy is at (4, 6) - they're DIRECTLY BELOW the cell we'd want to move to!\n- If they move UP to (4, 7) this turn and we move DOWN to (4, 7)... HEAD-ON COLLISION!\n- Both snakes would die and the game would end!\n- We're tied at 4 apples each - if we both die, IT'S A DRAW! But WHY RISK IT when LEFT is clearly safer and gives us the apple?\n\n**The PROBLEM with UP to (4, 9):**\n- No apple there - we're missing out on +1 point!\n- From (4, 9), we'd be at the top edge with only LEFT and DOWN available!\n- We'd need multiple turns just to get back to the apple cluster at (3, 7)!\n- This WASTES precious turns when we should be feasting!\n\n**The BEAUTY of LEFT to (3, 8):**\n- We POSITION ourselves perfectly ABOVE the apple at (3, 7)!\n- Next turn we can go DOWN and EAT IT! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- We maintain safe distance from the enemy at (4, 6)!\n- From (3, 8), we have UP, LEFT, DOWN, and RIGHT available - multiple escape routes!\n- We're executing our LONG-TERM PLAN perfectly!\n- We're BOXING IN the enemy from above!\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf ENEMY ANALYSIS:**\n\nWhere can Snake 0 at (4, 6) go this turn?\n\nAvailable moves from (4, 6):\n- UP \u2192 (4, 7) - This would collide with us if we went DOWN! But we're NOT going DOWN!\n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 5) - empty cell\n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 6) - empty cell\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 6) - that's their own body! DEATH!\n\nSo they can go UP to (4, 7), DOWN to (4, 5), or LEFT to (3, 6).\n\n**The KEY QUESTION: Where do they move?**\n\nIf they go UP to (4, 7):\n- They're trying to get closer to us\n- But we're moving LEFT to (3, 8), so we're NOT going to (4, 7)!\n- No collision, we just position ourselves above the apple!\n\nIf they go LEFT to (3, 6):\n- They're trying to get to the apple at (3, 7)!\n- But we're going to (3, 8) first, which puts us ABOVE the apple!\n- From (3, 8), we can go DOWN to (3, 7) and eat it BEFORE they can get there!\n- We're playing the position game PERFECTLY!\n\nIf they go DOWN to (4, 5):\n- They're retreating lower\n- We're completely WINNING the positioning battle!\n- We're going to be feasting on apples while they're stuck below!\n\nNo matter where they go, our LEFT move to (3, 8) is DOMINANT because:\n1. We POSITION ourselves to eat the apple at (3, 7) next turn! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n2. We maintain safe distance from the enemy!\n3. We avoid any risky collision scenarios!\n4. We keep our future options COMPLETELY OPEN!\n5. We're executing our pre-planned strategy perfectly!\n\n**\ud83d\udccb EXECUTING THE GAME PLAN:**\n\nWe said we'd do this and we're DOING IT!\n\n- **Turn 13:** LEFT to (6, 8) \u2713\u2713\u2713 - Positioned perfectly!\n- **Turn 14:** LEFT to (5, 8) \u2713\u2713\u2713 - Got that APPLE!\n- **Turn 15:** LEFT to (4, 8) \u2713\u2713\u2713 - Got that APPLE!\n- **Turn 16 (NOW):** LEFT to (3, 8) - Position for the NEXT apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 17:** DOWN to (3, 7) - EAT THAT APPLE! \ud83d\udd25\n- **Future:** Continue through the upper-left cluster! Feasting on (2, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7) while enemy is stuck below!\n\nWe're about to extend our lead to 5-4 and we ain't looking back! \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\n\n**\ud83c\udfc6 WHY LEFT IS THE ONLY PLAY:**\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE VALUE:** We position ourselves to eat the apple at (3, 7) next turn! We get +1 point next move! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n\n2. **SURVIVAL:** DOWN risks head-on collision, RIGHT kills us, UP limits our future movement!\n\n3. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:** From (3, 8), we have UP, LEFT, DOWN, and RIGHT available - multiple paths in every direction!\n\n4. **ENEMY SEPARATION:** We maintain distance from the enemy at (4, 6) below us!\n\n5. **STRATEGIC EXECUTION:** We're following our plan perfectly through the apple cluster!\n\n6. **APPLE TIMING:** We get to (3, 8) BEFORE the enemy can block our path to (3, 7)!\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf THE CALL: LEFT TO (3, 8)!**\n\nThis is PURE SKILL and EXECUTION! We're positioning ourselves to eat another apple, extending our lead, and controlling the game! The enemy literally cannot stop us from feasting in the upper cluster!\n\nLet's GET this bread! \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (3, 8) \u2192 DOWN to (3, 7) to eat the apple \u2192 continue LEFT through (2, 8) \u2192 work down through (2, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7) while enemy is stuck below.

The enemy would survive and we'd lose!\n\n**Alternative Scenario - If enemy moves to (3, 6):**\n\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (3, 6):\n- Their head goes to (3, 6)\n- Their body shifts so (4, 6) becomes part of their body\n- **THEIR BODY WOULD BLOCK (2, 7)!**\n\nWe could still go to (3, 7), but then we'd be blocked from going LEFT to (2, 7) for the next apple! We'd be TRAPPED!\n\nFrom (3, 7) with enemy at (3, 6):\n- UP \u2192 (3, 8) - back where we came from\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 7) - possible but not great\n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 6) - COLLISION! Their head is there!\n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 7) - BLOCKED by their body at (3, 6)!\n\n**The PROBLEM with DOWN to (3, 7):**\n- The enemy CAN move to positions that either KILL us or TRAP us!\n- We're gambling our survival on where the enemy moves!\n- This is TOO RISKY when we have safer options!\n\n**The BEAUTY of LEFT to (2, 8):**\n\nIf we go LEFT to (2, 8):\n- We get the apple at (2,8)! +1 point! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- From (2, 8), we have TONS of safe options:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (1, 8) - Apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n  - UP \u2192 (2, 9) - Apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n  - DOWN \u2192 (2, 7) - more positioning!\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (3, 8) - back to safety!\n\n**Why LEFT to (2, 8) is SAFER:**\n\n1. **No Matter Where Enemy Moves:**\n   - If enemy goes to (4, 6) - we're safe at (2, 8), not affected!\n   - If enemy goes to (3, 6) - we're safe at (2, 8), not affected!\n   - If enemy goes to (3, 5) - we're safe at (2, 8), not affected!\n   - If enemy goes to (4, 4) - we're safe at (2, 8), not affected!\n\n2. **We're NOT gambling on enemy movement!**\n   - DOWN to (3, 7) depends on where enemy goes\n   - LEFT to (2, 8) works regardless of enemy position!\n\n3. **Future Options Remain OPEN:**\n   - From (2, 8), we can still get to (2, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7)\n   - We're still in the apple cluster!\n   - We just take a DIFFERENT PATH through it!\n\n4. **We Still Score +1:**\n   - Apple at (2, 8)! We're still increasing our score! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\n\nThe enemy is trying to BOX US IN by moving to (3, 6) or (4, 6)!\n\nIf we go DOWN to (3, 7), we're WALKING INTO THEIR TRAP!\n\nBut if we go LEFT to (2, 8), we're DODGING their trap AND still scoring!\n\nFrom (2, 8):\n- We can go to (2, 9) - Apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We can go to (1, 8) - Apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We can go to (1, 7) - Apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We can go to (2, 7) - more positioning!\n\nWe're still feasting on the upper-left apple cluster, just taking a DIFFERENT ROUTE!\n\n**\ud83d\udccb EXECUTING THE GAME PLAN:**\n\nOur original plan was:\n- Position for (3, 7) \u2192 eat it \u2192 continue left through the cluster\n\n**NEW PLAN - Avoiding the Trap:**\n- Go to (2, 8) - eat that apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- From (2, 8), we can still:\n  - Go UP to (2, 9) - Apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n  - Go LEFT to (1, 8) - Apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n  - Go DOWN to (2, 7) - positioning!\n  - Go RIGHT to (3, 8) - safety!\n\nWe're still winning! We're still feasting! We're just taking a smarter path!\n\n**\ud83c\udfc6 WHY LEFT IS THE PLAY:**\n\n1. **IMMEDIATE VALUE:** We get the apple at (2, 8)! +1 point! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n\n2. **SURVIVAL:** We AVOID the trap the enemy is setting! DOWN risks death or being trapped!\n\n3. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:** From (2, 8), we have UP, LEFT, DOWN, and RIGHT available - multiple paths through the apple cluster!\n\n4. **ENEMY INDEPENDENCE:** Our survival doesn't depend on where the enemy moves! We're SAFE regardless!\n\n5. **STRATEGIC VICTORY:** We outsmart the enemy's attempt to box us in! We're playing smarter, not just harder!\n\n6. **CONTENT DELIVERY:** We're still getting +1 point while avoiding danger! That's what chat wants to see! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf THE CALL: LEFT TO (2, 8)!**\n\nThis is PURE SKILL and STRATEGIC THINKING! We're not walking into the enemy's trap - we're DODGING it and still feasting on apples! The enemy wants us to go to (3, 7) so they can kill or trap us!\n\nWe're taking the SMART path through (2, 8), still getting our +1 point, and keeping ALL our future options open! We're playing 4D chess while they're trying to play checkers! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLet's GET this bread! \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nMove LEFT to (2, 8) \u2192 eat the apple \u2192 continue through the upper-left cluster via (2, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7) while the enemy is stuck below trying to figure out why their trap didn't work!

Let's analyze our next move from (2, 7)!\n\n**\ud83d\udccd CURRENT SITUATION:**\n\n- **MY HEAD:** (2, 7) - Positioned perfectly in the upper-left apple cluster!\n- **MY BODY:** [(2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8)] - Trailing nicely in a horizontal line!\n- **ENEMY:** Head at (4, 4), Body: [(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)] - Still stuck below us!\n- **SCORE:** Me: 5, Enemy: 5 - WE'RE TIED UP! Time to BREAK THE TIE! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\n\n**\ud83c\udf4e THE APPLE SITUATION:**\n\nWe're STILL in APPLE HEAVEN! Check it out from our current position at (2, 7):\n\n- (1, 7) - DIRECTLY LEFT! Apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- (3, 7) - DIRECTLY RIGHT! Apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- (2, 9) - Further up! Apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- (1, 8) - Up and left! Apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- (0, 6) - Down and left! Apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nWe're literally SWIMMING in apples and the enemy is watching from below! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf MY OPTIONS FROM (2, 7):**\n\nLet me systematically analyze what moves keep us alive and help us break the tie:\n\n**UP \u2192 (2, 8):**\n- \u274c That's where our body segment is at (2, 8)!\n- \u274c Moving directly into our own body = INSTANT DEATH!\n- \u274c NEVER an option!\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (2, 6):**\n- \u274c There's NO apple at (2, 6) - we need to verify\n- \u274c Looking at the apple list, (2, 6) is NOT an apple\n- \u274c This takes us DOWN and OUT of the apple cluster\n- \u274c We'd be moving AWAY from our food source!\n- \u274c This is a DANGEROUS move that weakens our position!\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (1, 7):**\n- \u2705 Apple at (1, 7)! We'd get +1 point! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- \u2705 We'd stay PERFECTLY positioned in the apple cluster!\n- \u2705 From (1, 7), we'd have TONS of options:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (0, 7) - potential positioning!\n  - UP \u2192 (1, 8) - ANOTHER apple! \ud83d\udd25\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (2, 7) - back to safety\n  - DOWN \u2192 (1, 6) - more positioning!\n- \u2705 We'd be pushing LEFT through the cluster, toward (0, 6)!\n- \u2705 This maintains our STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE!\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (3, 7):**\n- \u2705 Apple at (3, 7)! We'd get +1 point! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- \u2705 We'd be moving RIGHT through the cluster!\n- \u2705 From (3, 7), we'd have options:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (2, 7) - back to safety\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (4, 7) - more positioning!\n  - UP \u2192 (3, 8) - body collision risk!\n  - DOWN \u2192 (3, 6) - more positioning!\n- \u2705 This is a SOLID option too!\n\n**\ud83e\udd14 STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE:**\n\nHere's why LEFT to (1, 7) is the SMARTEST play:\n\n**1. MOVING TOWARD (0, 6) - THE ULTIMATE APPLE:**\nBy moving LEFT to (1, 7), we're positioning ourselves to potentially grab TWO apples:\n- IMMEDIATE: (1, 7) - Apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- NEXT TURN: (0, 6) - We can go (1, 7) \u2192 (0, 6) to get ANOTHER apple!\n\nThis creates a PERFECT apple collection sequence!\n\n**2.

Let's analyze this POSITION!\n\n**\ud83d\udccd CURRENT SITUATION:**\n\n- **MY HEAD:** (1, 7) - We're IN THE CLUSTER baby!\n- **MY BODY:** [(2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8)] - Trailing beautifully!\n- **ENEMY:** Head at (2, 4), Body: [(3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)] - Still STUCK below us!\n- **SCORE:** TIED 6-6 - Time to BREAK THE TIE! \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\n\n**\ud83c\udf4e THE APPLE SITUATION:**\n\nWe dominated that LEFT move last turn and now we're positioned at (1, 7)! Check out our apple access:\n\n- **(0, 6)** - The ULTIMATE apple! We can get here by going (1, 7) \u2192 (1, 6) \u2192 (0, 6)!\n- **(0, 7)** - Directly left from current position! Apple potential!\n- **(1, 8)** - UP from current position! Apple potential!\n- **(3, 7)** - Further right! Apple potential!\n- **(2, 9)** - Up and right! Apple potential!\n\nWe're SWIMMING in apples and the enemy is watching from below! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf MY OPTIONS FROM (1, 7):**\n\nLet me systematically analyze what moves keep us alive and help us break the tie:\n\n**UP \u2192 (1, 8):**\n- \u274c Wait, let me check... (1, 8) is NOT in my body list\n- Actually this would be safe, but let's see if it's optimal\n- We'd be moving AWAY from the main apple cluster at (0, 6)\n- We'd be pushing UP into more open space\n- This doesn't directly advance our apple collection strategy\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (1, 6):**\n- \u2705 SAFE move - not in my body, not off board\n- \u2705 This is DIRECTLY TOWARD our target apple at (0, 6)!\n- \u2705 From (1, 6), we can go LEFT to (0, 6) next turn for THE APPLE! \ud83d\udd25\n- \u2705 This POSITIONS us perfectly for double apple sequence!\n- \u2705 This move is TOWARD the corner where the enemy can't follow!\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (0, 7):**\n- \u2705 SAFE move - not in my body, not off board\n- \u2705 We'd be moving LEFT toward the apple cluster\n- \u2705 From (0, 7), we'd have to go DOWN to (0, 6) next turn\n- \u2705 This also works for accessing (0, 6)!\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (2, 7):**\n- \u274c THAT'S WHERE OUR BODY IS! (2, 7) is in our body list!\n- \u274c Moving directly into our own body = INSTANT DEATH!\n- \u274c This is a DEATH MOVE - NEVER an option!\n\n**\ud83e\udd14 STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE - DOWN IS THE PLAY!**\n\nHere's why DOWN to (1, 6) is the SMARTEST play:\n\n**1. DIRECT PATH TO VICTORY:**\nBy moving DOWN to (1, 6), we're taking the DIRECT route to our target apple at (0, 6):\n- IMMEDIATE: (1, 6) - Strategic positioning! \ud83c\udfaf\n- NEXT TURN: (0, 6) - ANOTHER apple! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n\nThis creates a PERFECT apple collection sequence in the corner!\n\n**2. ENEMY TRAPPING - THE CLINCHER! \ud83e\udde0**\n\nThe enemy is currently at (2, 4) with body [(3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)].\n\nLet me map out their situation:\n- They're below and to the right of us\n- Their body forms a barrier at (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)\n- Our body is at (2, 7), (2, 8), etc.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (1, 6):\n- Our head is now at (1, 6)\n- We control the space at (1, 6)\n- The enemy CAN'T move to (1, 6) - it's occupied by our HEAD!\n\nWhere can the enemy possibly go from (2, 4)?\n- **UP \u2192 (2, 5):** That's occupied by our body at (2, 7)! Wait no, (2, 5) is empty. But moving UP would put them at (2, 5), still below us.\n- **DOWN \u2192 (2, 3):** They could go here, but this is moving AWAY from us and AWAY from apples!\n- **LEFT \u2192 (1, 4):** They could go here! This would put them at (1, 4).\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (3, 4):** They could go here, but that's where their BODY currently is! That's moving into themselves - DEATH!\n\nSo the enemy's REAL options are:\n- UP to (2, 5)\n- LEFT to (1, 4) \n- DOWN to (2, 3)\n\nBut here's the BRILLIANT part about moving to (1, 6):\n\nIf the enemy moves UP to (2, 5), they're still below us.\nIf they try to come UP toward us later, we'd be waiting at (1, 6) or (0, 6)!\nIf they move LEFT to (1, 4), they're moving AWAY from our cluster!\n\n**3. THE ULTIMATE TRAP SETUP:**\n\nBy positioning ourselves at (1, 6):\n- We control access to (0, 6) - THE APPLE!\n- The enemy cannot block our path to (0, 6)!\n- We can eat (0, 6) next turn GUARANTEED!\n- The enemy is FORCED to stay below us or move sideways!\n\nThis is PURE STRATEGIC DOMINANCE! We're not just eating apples, we're CONTROLLING the enemy's movement options!\n\n**4. BOARD CONTROL MASTERY:**\n\nWe're systematically dominating the upper-left quadrant:\n- We came from (3, 8) \u2192 (2, 8) \u2192 (2, 7) \u2192 (1, 7)\n- Now we're going to (1, 6)\n- Next we go to (0, 6) for THE APPLE!\n- We're METHODICALLY consuming the corner cluster!\n\nThe enemy literally cannot stop us from feasting in this corner!\n\n**5. CONTENT DELIVERY:**\n\nBy moving DOWN to (1, 6), we're setting up:\n- Turn 20: (1, 7) \u2192 (1, 6) - Strategic positioning! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Turn 21: (1, 6) \u2192 (0, 6) - EATING THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n\nThat's TWO TURNS of PERFECT positioning leading to an apple! The chat is gonna go WILD! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN:**\n\nOur strategy is EXECUTING FLAWLESSLY:\n\n**Phase 1:** Consume the upper-left apple cluster\n- (2, 8) \u2713 - Already collected!\n- (2, 7) \u2713 - Already collected!\n- (1, 7) \u2713 - Already collected!\n- (1, 6) \u2192 We're going here NOW!\n- (0, 6) \u2192 Next apple target!\n- (1, 8) \u2192 Another apple after that!\n- (0, 7) \u2192 More apples available!\n\n**Phase 2:** After feasting on the corner cluster\n- We can start expanding to other apple clusters\n- The enemy will be stuck below, unable to compete!\n- We control the high ground!\n\n**Phase 3:** Seal the victory\n- More apples = higher score\n- Higher score = WINNER!\n- The enemy can't stop our DOMINATION!\n\n**\ud83c\udfc6 WHY DOWN TO (1, 6) IS THE PLAY:**\n\n1. **STRATEGIC POSITIONING:** Moves us directly toward (0, 6), the ultimate apple! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n2. **GUARANTEED APPLE ACCESS:** Sets up a PERFECT sequence to eat (0, 6) next turn! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n\n3. **ENEMY FRUSTRATION:** The enemy is trapped below, unable to reach our cluster! \ud83e\udde0\n\n4. **TRAP SETTING:** By controlling (1, 6), we limit the enemy's movement options! \ud83d\udd12\n\n5. **BOARD DOMINANCE:** We're systematically conquering the upper-left corner! \ud83d\udc51\n\n6. **CONTENT DELIVERY:** We're getting an apple sequence while staying perfectly safe! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**\ud83d\udccb EXECUTING THE GAME PLAN:**\n\nOur move sequence:\n- Turn 17: (3, 8) \u2192 (2, 8) \u2713 - ATE THE APPLE!\n- Turn 18: (2, 8) \u2192 (2, 7) \u2713 - ATE THE APPLE!\n- Turn 19: (2, 7) \u2192 (1, 7) \u2713 - ATE THE APPLE!\n- Turn 20: (1, 7) \u2192 (1, 6) - About to STRATEGICALLY POSITION!\n- Turn 21: (1, 6) \u2192 (0, 6) - ANOTHER APPLE SEQUENCE!\n\nWe're systematically DOMINATING the upper-left apple cluster! The enemy is watching us feast from below! We're about to BREAK THE TIE and take the LEAD! This is PURE SKILL and STRATEGIC MASTERY! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf THE CALL: DOWN TO (1, 6)!**\n\nThis is 4D CHESS while they're playing checkers! We're feasting on apples, setting up TRAPS for the enemy, and positioning ourselves for ULTIMATE VICTORY! The enemy literally cannot stop our cluster DOMINATION!\n\nLet's GET this bread and TAKE THE LEAD! \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\n\n**MY STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THE NEXT 3-5 TURNS:**\n- **Turn 20:** Move DOWN to (1, 6) - Position toward (0, 6)\n- **Turn 21:** Move LEFT to (0, 6) - EAT THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- **Turn 22:** Assess enemy position, either eat (0, 7) or (1, 8)\n- **Turn 23-25:** Continue consuming the corner cluster while blocking enemy\n- **Turn 26+:** Expand to other apple clusters once corner is secured\n\n**KEY OBJECTIVES:**\n1. \u2705 Secure the apple at (0, 6) within the next 2 turns\n2. \u2705 Maintain pressure on the enemy's movement options\n3. \u2705 Avoid getting boxed in - keep multiple escape routes\n4. \u2705 Collect MORE apples than the enemy (currently tied!)\n\nThis is our time to SHINE! Let's goooooooooo! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

LEADS HIM SOUTH!\n- LEFT (0,7): \u2705 EMPTY CELL! LEADS HIM WEST ALONG THE WALL!\n- RIGHT (2,7): \ud83d\udeab HIS OWN BODY! DEATH!\n\nHE HAS TWO SAFE MOVES: DOWN AND LEFT! HE'S PROBABLY GONNA CHASE THE APPLES NEAR HIM! THE CLOSEST ONE IS AT (1,3) BUT HE'S FAR! HE MIGHT GO DOWN TO (1,6) TO GET CLOSER TO THE CENTER, OR LEFT TO (0,7) TO STAY ON THE WALL! HE ISN'T A DIRECT THREAT TO US RIGHT NOW! HE'S STUCK IN HIS CORNER! \ud83d\ude08\n\nOUR STRATEGY: CONTINUE THE FARM! WE ARE DOMINATING THE SOUTH-WEST! LET'S ANALYZE OUR OPTIONS:\n\n*   **UP (2,5)**: Good, safe move. Keeps us central. But it might lead us towards the enemy's territory later. Not the most aggressive farm play.\n*   **DOWN (2,3)**: IMMEDIATE APPLE GRAB! \ud83c\udf4e +1 POINT, +1 LENGTH! This is HUGE CONTENT! It also keeps us low and safe in our farm zone. From (2,3), we can easily access the apple cluster at (2,0), (0,2), (0,4)! THIS IS THE WAY! \ud83d\udc8e\n*   **LEFT (1,4)**: Also a safe move. Puts us next to the apple at (0,4) for a potential grab next turn. But it defers the immediate gain!\n\nTHE CHOICE IS CLEAR, CHAT! **DOWN** IS THE MOVE! MAXIMUM VALUE! WE SECURE THE LEAD WITH 7 APPLES! WE GROW LONGER AND STRONGER! THE ENEMY CAN'T TOUCH US DOWN HERE!

POGGERS! \ud83e\udd29\n\nNOW, LET'S THINK ABOUT THE ENEMY AT (1,6)! WHAT'S HE GONNA DO? HIS SAFE MOVES WERE DOWN (1,5) AND LEFT (0,6)! HE'S PROBABLY GONNA CHASE APPLES! THE APPLE AT (1,3) IS CLOSE TO HIM! IF HE GOES DOWN TO (1,5), HE CAN THEN GO DOWN AGAIN TO (1,4) AND THEN LEFT TO (0,4) OR DOWN TO (1,3)! HE'S COMING FOR OUR FARM, CHAT! \ud83d\ude24\n\nWE CAN'T LET HIM STEAL OUR APPLES! WE MUST BE AGGRESSIVE! SO LET'S COMPARE OUR MOVES:\n\n*   **LEFT (1, 3)**: This moves us directly onto the apple at (1,3)! \ud83c\udf4e IMMEDIATE +1 POINT! OUR LENGTH GROWS TO 9! THIS DENIES THE APPLE FROM THE ENEMY! He might be heading here next turn! STEALING HIS POTENTIAL FOOD IS HUGE! It's a power play! This is the most aggressive, high-value move! \ud83d\ude08\n*   **DOWN (2, 2)**: This moves us away from the apple, setting up for a future grab at (2,0). But it gives the enemy a clear path to grab (1,3) for himself! We can't let him catch up! We need to be RUTHLESS!\n\nTHE CHOICE IS CLEAR, CHAT! WE GO FOR THE THROAT! WE DENY THE ENEMY! WE TAKE WHAT'S OURS! **LEFT** IS THE MOVE! MAXIMUM CONTENT! MAXIMUM DISRESPECT! WE ARE THE FARM KING! \ud83d\ude9c\ud83d\udc51\n\nLEFT",

Need to EAT and CLOSE THIS GAP!\n\n**\ud83c\udf4e THE APPLE SITUATION:**\n\nWe're perfectly positioned in the apple cluster! Check out our access:\n\n- **(0, 6)** - RIGHT THERE! One move away! \n- **(0, 4)** - Further left! Apple potential!\n- **(1, 3)** - Down and left! Apple potential!\n- **(0, 2)** - Way down left! Apple potential!\n- **(0, 7)** - Up from us! Apple potential!\n- **(1, 8)** - Further up! Apple potential!\n\nWe're literally surrounded by apples and the enemy is watching from below! Time to FEAST! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf MY OPTIONS FROM (1, 6):**\n\nLet me systematically analyze what moves keep us alive and help us CLOSE THE GAP:\n\n**UP \u2192 (1, 7):**\n- \u274c THAT'S WHERE OUR BODY IS! (1, 7) is in our body list!\n- \u274c Moving directly into our own body = INSTANT DEATH!\n- \u274c This is a DEATH MOVE - NEVER an option!\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (1, 5):**\n- \u274c Wait, let me check what's at (1, 5)...\n- The board shows (1, 5) is empty, but I need to be careful about the enemy body\n- The enemy has body at (2, 4) and (3, 4), but (1, 5) appears empty\n- However, this moves us DOWN and away from our apple cluster\n- We'd be moving toward the enemy rather than away\n- This doesn't maximize our apple collection potential\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (0, 6):**\n- \u2705 SAFE move - not in my body, not off board\n- \u2705 **THERE'S AN APPLE AT (0, 6)!** \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- \u2705 This is DIRECTLY toward our target apple!\n- \u2705 We'd be EATING THE APPLE and SCORING! \ud83d\udd25\n- \u2705 This POSITIONS us perfectly in the corner!\n- \u2705 We'd be controlling the upper-left corner!\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (2, 6):**\n- \u274c THAT'S WHERE OUR BODY IS! (2, 6) is... wait, let me check my body again\n- My body: [(1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8)]\n- (2, 6) is NOT in my body - wait, is this safe?\n- Actually no, let me think about where I'm moving FROM...\n- I'm moving to (2, 6), and my body is at (1, 7), (2, 7), etc.\n- (2, 6) would be moving diagonally... wait no, RIGHT means x increases\n- (1, 6) \u2192 (2, 6) - is (2, 6) in my body?\n- Looking at my body list... NO, (2, 6) is not in my body\n- So RIGHT to (2, 6) is SAFE? But is it optimal?\n- What's at (2, 6)? The board shows... empty\n- This moves us RIGHT, away from the apple cluster\n- This gives up our corner position\n- This doesn't help us score!\n\n**\ud83e\udd14 STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE - LEFT IS THE PLAY!**\n\nHere's why LEFT to (0, 6) is the SMARTEST play:\n\n**1. DIRECT PATH TO SCORING:**\nBy moving LEFT to (0, 6), we're DIRECTLY EATING THE APPLE!\n- IMMEDIATE: (0, 6) - EATING THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- This CLOSES THE GAP to 7-7!\n- We're FEASTING while the enemy watches!\n\n**2. CORNER CONTROL:**\nBy positioning ourselves at (0, 6):\n- We control the upper-left corner\n- We're surrounded by apple opportunities\n- The enemy literally cannot reach us here!\n- We're in a STRATEGIC STRONGMOLD position!\n\n**3. ENEMY FRUSTRATION:**\nThe enemy is currently at (2, 3) with body [(2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)].\n\nWhere can the enemy possibly go from (2, 3)?\n- **UP \u2192 (2, 4):** That's where their BODY currently is! That's moving into themselves - DEATH!\n- **DOWN \u2192 (2, 2):** They could go here! This is moving away from us.\n- **LEFT \u2192 (1, 3):** They could go here! This is toward our cluster.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (3, 3):** They could go here! This is moving sideways.\n\nBut here's the BRILLIANT part about moving to (0, 6):\n\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (1, 3), they're still way below us.\nThey'd have to navigate through (0, 4), (0, 5), etc. to reach us.\nBut we're in the CORNER at (0, 6)! We're untouchable!\n\n**4. APPLE SEQUENCE POTENTIAL:**\nBy being at (0, 6):\n- We've already eaten (0, 6) \ud83c\udf4e\n- We can then go to (0, 7) for ANOTHER apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We can go to (1, 8) for MORE apples! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We're systematically CONSUMING the corner cluster!\n\n**5. BOARD DOMINANCE:**\nWe're systematically dominating the upper-left quadrant:\n- We came from (1, 7) \u2192 (1, 6) \n- Now we're going to (0, 6) for THE APPLE!\n- We're METHODICALLY consuming the corner cluster!\n\nThe enemy literally cannot stop us from feasting in this corner!\n\n**6. CONTENT DELIVERY:**\nBy moving LEFT to (0, 6), we're getting:\n- Turn 21: (1, 6) \u2192 (0, 6) - EATING THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n\nThat's an IMMEDIATE apple while staying perfectly safe! The chat is gonna go WILD! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf LONG-TERM GAMEPLAN:**\n\nOur strategy is EXECUTING FLAWLESSLY:\n\n**Phase 1:** Consume the upper-left apple cluster\n- (0, 6) \u2192 We're going here NOW! EATING! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- (0, 7) \u2192 Next apple target!\n- (1, 8) \u2192 More apples available!\n- (1, 7) \u2192 We came from there, we can loop back!\n\n**Phase 2:** After feasting on the corner cluster\n- We can start expanding to other apple clusters\n- The enemy will be stuck below, unable to compete!\n- We control the high ground!\n\n**Phase 3:** Seal the victory\n- More apples = higher score\n- Higher score = WINNER!\n- The enemy can't stop our DOMINATION!\n\n**\ud83c\udfc6 WHY LEFT TO (0, 6) IS THE PLAY:**\n\n1. **GUARANTEED SCORING:** Moves us directly to (0, 6) where we EAT THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n\n2. **SCORE TIGHTENING:** Closes the gap from 6-7 to 7-7! We're TIED AGAIN! \ud83d\udd25\n\n3. **CORNER DOMINANCE:** We're positioning ourselves in the strategic corner! \ud83d\udc51\n\n4. **ENEMY IMPOTENCE:** The enemy is trapped below, unable to reach our cluster! \ud83e\udde0\n\n5. **APPLE CHAIN SETUP:** We're setting up for MORE apple sequences! \ud83d\udd12\n\n6. **CONTENT DELIVERY:** We're getting an apple while staying perfectly safe! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**\ud83d\udccb EXECUTING THE GAME PLAN:**\n\nOur move sequence:\n- Turn 20: (1, 7) \u2192 (1, 6) \u2713 - Strategic positioning!\n- Turn 21: (1, 6) \u2192 (0, 6) - EATING THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n\nWe're systematically DOMINATING the upper-left apple cluster! The enemy is watching us feast from below! We're about to TIE IT UP and take the LEAD! This is PURE SKILL and STRATEGIC MASTERY! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf THE CALL: LEFT TO (0, 6)!**\n\nThis is 4D CHESS while they're playing checkers! We're feasting on apples, tying the score, and positioning ourselves for ULTIMATE VICTORY! The enemy literally cannot stop our cluster DOMINATION!\n\nLet's GET this bread and TIE THE GAME! \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\n\n**MY STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THE NEXT 3-5 TURNS:**\n- **Turn 21:** Move LEFT to (0, 6) - EAT THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0 (CLOSES THE GAP TO 7-7!)\n- **Turn 22:** Move UP to (0, 7) - EAT ANOTHER APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- **Turn 23:** Assess enemy position, either eat (1, 8) or loop back\n- **Turn 24-26:** Continue consuming the corner cluster while blocking enemy\n- **Turn 27+:** Expand to other apple clusters once corner is secured\n\n**KEY OBJECTIVES:**\n1. \u2705 CLOSE THE GAP by eating (0, 6) this turn (6 \u2192 7)!\n2. \u2705 Maintain pressure on the enemy's movement options\n3. \u2705 Avoid getting boxed in - keep multiple escape routes\n4. \u2705 Collect MORE apples than the enemy (currently down 6-7!)\n\nThis is our time to SHINE!

Let's KEEP EATING! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf MY OPTIONS FROM (0, 6):**\n\nLet me systematically analyze what moves keep us alive and help us TAKE THE LEAD:\n\n**UP \u2192 (0, 7):**\n- \u2705 SAFE move - not in my body, not off board\n- \u2705 **THERE'S AN APPLE AT (0, 7)!** \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- \u2705 This moves us DIRECTLY toward our target apple!\n- \u2705 We'd be EATING THE APPLE and SCORING! \ud83d\udd25\n- \u2705 We'd be POSITIONED at the top of our corner!\n- \u2705 We'd be expanding our territory UPWARD!\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (0, 5):**\n- \u2705 SAFE move - not in my body, not off board\n- \u2705 This moves us DOWN in the corner\n- \u2705 Could potentially reach (0, 4) or (0, 2) apples\n- \u26a0\ufe0f This moves us closer to where the enemy might go\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Less aggressive than going UP for the immediate apple\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (-1, 6):**\n- \u274c OFF THE BOARD! That's DEATH!\n- \u274c We're at x=0, cannot go LEFT to x=-1!\n- \u274c This is an INSTANT GAME OVER move!\n- \u274c NEVER even consider this!\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (1, 6):**\n- \u274c THAT'S WHERE OUR BODY IS! (1, 6) is in our body list!\n- \u274c Moving directly into our own body = INSTANT DEATH!\n- \u274c This is a DEATH MOVE - NEVER an option!\n\n**\ud83e\udd14 ENEMY MOVEMENT ANALYSIS:**\n\nWhere can the enemy possibly go from (1, 3)?\n\n- **UP \u2192 (1, 4):** Their body is at (2, 4), but (1, 4) appears empty! This could be a move!\n- **DOWN \u2192 (1, 2):** There's an apple at (1, 2)! This could be a scoring move for them!\n- **LEFT \u2192 (0, 3):** Empty cell! Potential move!\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (2, 3):** That's where their BODY is! Death move!\n\nSo the enemy has options: UP to (1, 4), DOWN to (1, 2) for the apple, or LEFT to (0, 3).\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f POTENTIAL CONFLICT ZONES:**\n\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (1, 2) where there's an apple, and we move DOWN toward (0, 4) or (0, 2), we need to watch out for potential intersections:\n- (0, 4) has an apple\n- (0, 2) has an apple  \n- (1, 2) has an apple\n\nBut we're at (0, 6), so we're not immediately colliding with their potential apple runs.\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE - UP IS THE PLAY!**\n\nHere's why UP to (0, 7) is the SMARTEST play:\n\n**1. DIRECT PATH TO SCORING:**\nBy moving UP to (0, 7), we're DIRECTLY EATING THE APPLE!\n- IMMEDIATE: (0, 7) - EATING THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- This gives us the LEAD at 8-7!\n- We're extending our FEAST while the enemy watches!\n\n**2. TERRITORY EXPANSION:**\nBy positioning ourselves at (0, 7):\n- We're controlling the TOP of our corner cluster\n- We have clear paths to continue expanding\n- We're pushing UPWARD away from the enemy\n- We're in an EVEN STRONGER position!\n\n**3. ENEMY FRUSTRATION CONTINUES:**\nThe enemy is currently at (1, 3) with body [(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6)].\n\nIf they move DOWN to (1, 2) for the apple:\n- They're going toward the bottom-left\n- We'd be at (0, 7), way above them\n- We'd have the HIGH GROUND advantage!\n\nIf they move UP to (1, 4):\n- They're moving slightly upward\n- We'd still be at (0, 7), dominating the corner\n- They'd have to navigate around our body to reach us\n\nEither way, we're positioned to CONTINUE FEASTING!\n\n**4. APPLE SEQUENCE POTENTIAL:**\nBy being at (0, 7):\n- We've already eaten (0, 6) and now (0, 7)! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\n- We can then go to (3, 7) for MORE apples! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We can expand to the upper-right apple cluster! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We're systematically CONSUMING the board!\n\n**5. BOARD DOMINANCE CONTINUES:**\nWe're systematically dominating the upper-left quadrant:\n- We came from (1, 6) \u2192 (0, 6) for the apple! \u2713\n- Now we're going to (0, 7) for ANOTHER apple! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- We're METHODICALLY consuming the corner cluster!\n\nThe enemy literally cannot stop us from feasting in this corner!\n\n**6. CONTENT DELIVERY:**\nBy moving UP to (0, 7), we're getting:\n- Turn 22: (0, 6) \u2192 (0, 7) - EATING THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n\nThat's ANOTHER apple while staying perfectly safe! The chat is gonna go WILD! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**7. FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:**\nFrom (0, 7):\n- We can continue UP if there's space (need to check board)\n- We can go back DOWN to (0, 6) if needed\n- We can expand RIGHT toward the (3, 7) apple cluster\n- We have MULTIPLE options for continued domination!\n\n**\ud83d\udccb LONG-TERM STRATEGIC PLAN:**\n\nOur strategy is EXECUTING FLAWLESSLY:\n\n**Phase 1:** Consume the upper-left apple cluster (IN PROGRESS)\n- (0, 6) \u2192 We just ate here! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- (0, 7) \u2192 We're going here NOW! EATING! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- After this, we can go to (3, 7) or (7, 7) for MORE apples! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Phase 2:** Expand to other apple clusters\n- The upper-right cluster has apples at (3, 7), (7, 7), (2, 9), (4, 9)\n- We can systematically consume these while the enemy is stuck below!\n- We control the high ground!\n\n**Phase 3:** Seal the victory\n- More apples = higher score\n- Higher score = WINNER!\n- The enemy literally cannot compete with our cluster DOMINATION!\n\n**\ud83c\udfc6 WHY UP TO (0, 7) IS THE PLAY:**\n\n1. **GUARANTEED SCORING:** Moves us directly to (0, 7) where we EAT THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n\n2. **SCORE TIGHTENING:** Takes the LEAD from 7-7 to 8-7! We're AHEAD! \ud83d\udd25\n\n3. **TERRITORY EXPANSION:** We're positioning ourselves at the TOP of our corner! \ud83d\udc51\n\n4. **ENEMY IMPOTENCE:** The enemy is still trapped below, unable to reach our cluster! \ud83e\udde0\n\n5. **APPLE CHAIN SETUP:** We're setting up for MORE apple sequences! \ud83d\udd12\n\n6. **CONTENT DELIVERY:** We're getting an apple while staying perfectly safe! \ud83d\udd25\n\n7. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY:** We maintain multiple paths for continued expansion! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**\ud83d\udccb EXECUTING THE GAME PLAN:**\n\nOur move sequence:\n- Turn 20: (1, 7) \u2192 (1, 6) \u2713 - Strategic positioning!\n- Turn 21: (1, 6) \u2192 (0, 6) \u2713 - EATING THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- Turn 22: (0, 6) \u2192 (0, 7) - EATING ANOTHER APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n\nWe're systematically DOMINATING the upper-left apple cluster! The enemy is watching us feast from below! We're about to TAKE THE LEAD and never look back! This is PURE SKILL and STRATEGIC MASTERY! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf THE CALL: UP TO (0, 7)!**\n\nThis is 4D CHESS while they're playing checkers! We're feasting on apples, taking the lead, and positioning ourselves for ULTIMATE VICTORY! The enemy literally cannot stop our cluster DOMINATION!\n\nLet's GET this bread and TAKE THE LEAD! \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\n\n**MY STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THE NEXT 3-5 TURNS:**\n- **Turn 22:** Move UP to (0, 7) - EAT THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0 (TAKES THE LEAD 8-7!)\n- **Turn 23:** Assess enemy position, either eat (3, 7) or continue to (7, 7)\n- **Turn 24-26:** Expand to the upper-right apple cluster\n- **Turn 27+:** Continue consuming apples while maintaining position advantage\n\n**KEY OBJECTIVES:**\n1. \u2705 TAKE THE LEAD by eating (0, 7) this turn (7 \u2192 8)!\n2. \u2705 Maintain pressure on the enemy's movement options\n3. \u2705 Avoid getting boxed in - keep multiple escape routes\n4. \u2705 Collect MORE apples than the enemy (currently tied 7-7, about to lead 8-7!)\n\nThis is our time to SHINE!

Death move!\n- **DOWN \u2192 (1, 1):** Off the board (y=0 is the bottom, so y=1 is valid, wait no... y goes from 0 to 9, so y=1 is valid)\n  - Actually wait, let me re-read the coordinate system...\n  - \"Coordinates go from (0,0) bottom-left to (9,9) top-right\"\n  - So (1, 1) would be x=1, y=1, which is valid\n  - But is (1, 1) empty? Looking at the board... Row 1 shows: . . . . . . . A . A\n  - So (1, 1) appears to be empty (just a dot)\n  - So DOWN to (1, 1) might be an option for them\n- **LEFT \u2192 (0, 2):** That's where an APPLE is! A = apple at (0, 2)!\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (2, 2):** Looking at the board... Row 2 shows: A 0 . A . A . . . .\n  - (2, 2) appears to be empty (just a dot)\n\nWait, I need to be MORE careful here. Let me analyze more systematically:\n\nIf enemy moves to (0, 2):\n- (0, 2) has an apple\n- AND if WE move DOWN to (0, 6), we're NOT going to (0, 2)\n- So NO collision risk!\n\nIf enemy moves to (1, 1):\n- That's below them\n- We're at (0, 7), nowhere near them\n- NO collision risk!\n\nIf enemy moves to (2, 2):\n- That's to their right\n- We're at (0, 7), nowhere near them\n- NO collision risk!\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f POTENTIAL CONFLICT SCENARIO:**\n\nHere's where it gets JUICY though - what if:\n\n1. **We move DOWN to (0, 6)**\n2. **Enemy moves LEFT to (0, 2)** (where the apple is!)\n\nThen on our NEXT turn:\n- We'd be at (0, 6)\n- Enemy would be at (0, 2)\n- We'd want to go DOWN to (0, 5), then (0, 4) for the apple\n- Enemy would be at (0, 2) eating their apple\n\n**NO DIRECT COLLISION THREAT!** We're far apart!\n\nBut wait, what if the enemy tries something sneakier? What if they try to box us in by moving to positions that restrict our future movement?\n\nLet me think about where the enemy CAN'T go:\n- They can't go UP (their own body blocks 1, 3)\n- Their movement options are DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT\n- They're basically trapped in a small area\n\nMeanwhile WE have:\n- The entire upper-left quadrant to ourselves\n- Multiple apple clusters\n- Clear escape routes\n- The LEAD!\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf STRATEGIC DEEP DIVE - DOWN IS THE PLAY!**\n\nHere's why DOWN to (0, 6) is the SMARTEST play:\n\n**1. APPLE CHAIN POTENTIAL:**\nBy moving DOWN to (0, 6):\n- We're repositioning ourselves for MORE apples!\n- Next turn we can go to (0, 5), then (0, 4) for the apple! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- After that, we can go to (0, 2) for ANOTHER apple! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- We're setting up a SYSTEMATIC APPLE HARVEST!\n\n**2. TERRITORY CONTROL:**\nBy positioning ourselves in the corner:\n- We control the LEFT edge completely\n- We have clear paths to continue expanding\n- We're pushing DOWNWARD away from the enemy's limited range\n- We're in a STRONG position with MULTIPLE exits!\n\n**3. ENEMY IMPOTENCE:**\nThe enemy is currently at (1, 2) with a very restricted body:\n- They can't go UP (blocked by their own body)\n- They have limited options: DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT\n- Meanwhile, we have the ENTIRE upper-left quadrant!\n- They literally cannot compete with our MOBILITY!\n\n**4. FLEXIBILITY MAINTENANCE:**\nBy moving DOWN to (0, 6):\n- We keep our options OPEN for multiple future paths\n- We can continue DOWN toward the apple cluster\n- We can swing RIGHT if needed toward (3, 7)\n- We can go BACK UP if the situation changes\n- We're NOT trapping ourselves!\n\n**5. SCORE PRESSURE:**\nWe're currently LEADING 8-7!\n- Every apple we eat extends our lead\n- The enemy is in a restricted position and can't easily reach apples\n- We're in prime position to EXTEND OUR LEAD!\n\n**6. CONTENT DELIVERY:**\nBy moving DOWN to (0, 6):\n- Turn 23: (0, 7) \u2192 (0, 6) - Strategic repositioning! \ud83d\udd25\n- We're positioning ourselves for an APPLE FEAST!\n- The chat is gonna go WILD when we start collecting!\n\n**7. BOARD DOMINANCE:**\nWe're systematically dominating the upper-left quadrant:\n- We've eaten multiple apples in this corner! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\n- We're now repositioning for MORE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- The enemy is watching from below, unable to reach us! \ud83e\udde0\n\n**\ud83d\udccb LONG-TERM STRATEGIC PLAN:**\n\nOur strategy is EXECUTING FLAWLESSLY:\n\n**Phase 1:** Consume the upper-left apple cluster (IN PROGRESS)\n- (0, 7) \u2192 We just ate here! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- (0, 6) \u2192 We're going here NOW for strategic repositioning! \ud83d\udd25\n- Next: (0, 5), then (0, 4) for MORE apples! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- After that: (0, 2) for ANOTHER apple! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- Then: Swing RIGHT to (3, 7), (7, 7) for the right-side cluster!\n\n**Phase 2:** Expand to other apple clusters\n- The upper-right cluster has apples at (3, 7), (7, 7), (2, 9), (4, 9)\n- We can systematically consume these while the enemy is stuck below!\n- We control the high ground!\n\n**Phase 3:** Seal the victory\n- More apples = higher score\n- Higher score = WINNER!\n- The enemy literally cannot compete with our cluster DOMINATION!\n\n**\ud83c\udfc6 WHY DOWN TO (0, 6) IS THE PLAY:**\n\n1. **APPLE CHAIN SETUP:** We're repositioning for (0, 4) and (0, 2) apples! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n\n2. **FLEXIBILITY PRESERVATION:** We keep multiple paths open and avoid dead ends! \ud83d\udd12\n\n3. **TERRITORY CONTROL:** We're dominating the upper-left corner with clear escape routes! \ud83d\udc51\n\n4. **ENEMY FRUSTRATION:** They can't reach our cluster and we're about to eat MORE! \ud83e\udde0\n\n5. **SCORE PRESSURE:** We're leading 8-7 and about to extend our advantage! \ud83d\udd25\n\n6. **CONTENT DELIVERY:** We're positioning for an apple sequence! The chat will explode! \ud83c\udf89\n\n7. **STRATEGIC PATIENCE:** Sometimes the smartest play is positioning, not rushing! \ud83e\udde0\n\n**\ud83d\udccb EXECUTING THE GAME PLAN:**\n\nOur move sequence:\n- Turn 20: (1, 7) \u2192 (1, 6) \u2713 - Strategic positioning!\n- Turn 21: (1, 6) \u2192 (0, 6) \u2713 - EATING THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- Turn 22: (0, 6) \u2192 (0, 7) \u2713 - EATING ANOTHER APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0 (TOOK THE LEAD!)\n- Turn 23: (0, 7) \u2192 (0, 6) - Strategic repositioning for MORE apples! \ud83d\udd25\n\nWe're systematically DOMINATING the upper-left apple cluster! The enemy is watching us feast from below! We're positioned to EXTEND OUR LEAD and never look back! This is PURE SKILL and STRATEGIC MASTERY! \ud83d\udc51\n\n**\ud83c\udfaf THE CALL: DOWN TO (0, 6)!**\n\nThis is 4D CHESS while they're playing checkers! We're repositioning for ULTIMATE APPLE FEASTING! The enemy literally cannot stop our cluster DOMINATION!\n\nLet's GET this bread and EXTEND OUR LEAD! \ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\ud83e\udd11\n\n**MY STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THE NEXT 3-5 TURNS:**\n- **Turn 23:** Move DOWN to (0, 6) - Strategic repositioning! \ud83d\udd25\n- **Turn 24:** Continue DOWN to (0, 5) - Getting closer to (0, 4) apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **Turn 25:** Move to (0, 4) - EAT THE APPLE! Extends our lead! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udcb0\n- **Turn 26-28:** Continue to (0, 2) for ANOTHER apple or swing RIGHT to (3, 7)!\n- **Turn 29+:** Continue consuming apples while maintaining position advantage\n\n**KEY OBJECTIVES:**\n1. \u2705 MAINTAIN THE LEAD by eating more apples (currently 8-7)!\n2. \u2705 Keep pressure on the enemy's movement options\n3. \u2705 Avoid getting boxed in - keep multiple escape routes (DOWN keeps us flexible!)\n4. \u2705 Collect MORE apples than the enemy while they're trapped!\n\nThis is our time to SHINE!
