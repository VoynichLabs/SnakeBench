No eat, length stays 7; new snake: head (0,4), body [(0,3),(0,2),(0,1),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)] tail. Follow-up: t18 UP to (0,5) empty (row 5 col 0 empty), t19 UP to (0,6) apple (grow to 7 apples/length 8, head (0,6), body includes (0,5)-(0,1),(1,1)-(1,3); shed (1,3) by t19). Path clear\u2014no blocks, own tail sheds east without interfering col 0. Post-eat at t19 (0,6): options open\u2014UP to (0,7) empty then RIGHT along row 7 (mostly empty, A at (5,7)) to eat in 5 turns (arrive t24, 8 apples); or RIGHT to (1,6) empty then maneuver to (2,8) A (NE path, ~5 turns) or south to (8,2)/(6,5). Enemy length 4, ~7-8 turns to (5,7) or (2,8) from likely moves (e.g., LEFT/DOWN toward center); my longer body (8 vs 4) and west start let me reach (5,7) first or loop to block without collision. Adjust next based on enemy direction.\n**END RATIONALE**\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Post-this-move (DOWN to new head (8,2)), the (8,2) apple is eaten, so the tail (7,5) stays\u2014new full body will be [(8,2), (8,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)] (5-segment body; reference this to avoid self-collision in next turn\u2019s moves).\n2. Next immediate target is the (6,5) apple (Manhattan distance 5 from (8,2)); initial safe path draft: (8,2) \u2192 (7,2) \u2192 (6,2) \u2192 (6,3) \u2192 (6,4) \u2192 (6,5) (verify self/enemy collision safety at each step).\n3. Snake 1\u2019s only safe move this turn is UP to (0,4), so its new body will be [(0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)]\u2014still confined to the lower-left quadrant (x\u22641), so no immediate threat; flag any x\u22652 moves by Snake 1 as a detour trigger.\n4. After securing (6,5), re-evaluate apple priorities (next likely target: (5,7) to claim upper-board space) and maintain \u22653 safe follow-up moves per turn.\n5. Confirm next turn\u2019s self-collision checks against the 5-segment body [(8,2), (8,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)].\n\n### Current Move Evaluation\n1. **Current State Confirmation**: My snake\u2019s full body (head-to-tail) is [(8,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)] (4 segments, head at (8,3)). Enemy Snake 1\u2019s only safe move is UP to (0,4) (no head-on collision risk with any of my possible moves).\n2. **Safe Move Elimination**:\n   - LEFT: New head (7,3) = own body segment (self-collision; eliminated).\n   - UP: New head (8,4) = safe (board-valid, no own/enemy body) but no immediate apple gain.\n   - DOWN: New head (8,2) = safe (board-valid, no own/enemy body) and eats the (8,2) apple (immediate growth to 5 segments).\n   - RIGHT: New head (9,3) = safe (board-valid, no own/enemy body) but no immediate apple gain.\n3. **Safe Move Prioritization**:\n   - Apple Proximity: DOWN is the only move that eats an immediate apple (critical for closing the score gap with Snake 1).\n   - Follow-Up Flexibility: DOWN preserves 3+ safe follow-up moves (e.g., LEFT to (7,2), RIGHT to (9,2), UP to (8,3) is invalid but other options exist).\n   - Head-On Collision Risk: Zero (Snake 1\u2019s new head (0,4) is unrelated to my new head (8,2)).\n\nDOWN",
