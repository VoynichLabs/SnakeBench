RIGHT to (8,8) keeps us close to apples, but I want to make him sweat. LEFT to (6,8) is the move that keeps the heat on him, still gives us room to wiggle, and prepares for a potential box-in as he routes along the left wall.\n\nWe\u2019re not chasing apples yet\u2014this is about forcing the rivalry, making him choose between freedom and a head-on. He\u2019s stuck near the corner, and I\u2019m pressing the field to cut off escape routes. Every safe step to the left shrinks his real estate while keeping multiple follow-ups available for me. What if he tries to rush right? I\u2019ll be waiting with a bigger play. Why give him room when we\u2019re the aggressor?\n\nPlan: Keep sliding left and then bump down towards the gap below him, so I can corral him against the wall and make him think twice before moving forward.\n\nLEFT",

So we maximize future control and flexibility.\n\n### Strategy note to future me\nPriority for the next few turns:\n- Go RIGHT now to get off the wall and open up the map.\n- Then likely go UP to secure (1,8) and start growing.\n- After first apple, drift toward the central cluster (around x=3\u20136, y=4\u20136) to control space.\n- Keep an eye on routes where we can later cut off the enemy\u2019s escape toward the middle/top-right; we want to be the one dictating corridors, not reacting.\n\nRIGHT",

All four moves keep me alive, but we have to think like a predator.\n\nUP would drift me away from the party and give him room to wiggle; RIGHT is just backing off toward open space, which is safe but sloppy when we\u2019re already behind on apples; DOWN might be okay but unpins me from the corridor I\u2019m building. LEFT keeps me marching toward him, keeps his options cramped, and lets me be poised to drop down once he\u2019s pinned. No risky head-on yet\u2014we\u2019re not the higher scorer, so we don\u2019t bait collisions, but we still set the sandbox for later.\n\nPlan/Strategy: Keep moving left along row 8 to shepherd him toward the wall, then slide down once he\u2019s trapped near column 0 so he\u2019s forced to either collide or surrender real estate.

Kinda passive, right?\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (0,8)**  \n- On the board, no apple.  \n- After move: head (0,8), body (1,8).  \n- Next turn options: UP (0,9), DOWN (0,7); can\u2019t go RIGHT (backwards into body), can\u2019t go LEFT off-board.  \n- Again just 2 options, and we\u2019re shoved onto the left wall. Super low pressure, zero dominance. \ud83d\ude24\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (2,8)**  \n- On the board, no apple.  \n- After move: head (2,8), body (1,8).  \n- Next turn options:  \n  - UP \u2192 (2,9)  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (3,8)  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (2,7)  \n- That\u2019s **3** future options, way more flexible \ud83d\udcaa  \n- Moves us **toward center** and toward the enemy on the right side.

DOWN is suicide.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 So what\u2019s the *ruthless* play? \ud83d\ude08  \n\nWe\u2019re ahead on apples. That means:\n- We\u2019re allowed to be aggressive.\n- We want central control and flexibility so we can **grow a fat wall** and eventually either:\n  - force them into our body, or  \n  - set up a head-on line where they can\u2019t dodge without boxing themselves.\n\n**RIGHT to (2,8)**:\n- Increases our future move options (3 ways out).\n- Rotates us toward the central & top lanes where there are juicy apples and better cut-off angles.\n- Brings us closer to the enemy without hugging a wall, keeping initiative.\n\nUP or LEFT both reduce our options and push us to edges with less control. That\u2019s how *they* get to dictate the game. Not happening. \ud83d\udc4e\n\n---\n\n### Strategy note to future me \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udcd3  \n- Moving **RIGHT** now to get off the side lane and start drifting toward the center-top corridor (x\u22482\u20135, y\u22487\u20139).  \n- Next few turns: keep options high (3 moves whenever possible), grow toward the cluster of central apples while sliding gradually rightward to threaten the enemy\u2019s escape routes.  \n- Look for chances to form a horizontal wall across the upper-middle rows, so we can herd the enemy downward into tight corridors and either:  \n  - trap his head against our body and the wall, or  \n  - bait a head-on when we\u2019re still ahead on apples.  \n\nRIGHT",

He *knows* a left-move is suicide vs our score lead. That\u2019s exactly the kind of zugzwang we want. \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd1d Compare UP vs RIGHT\n\n- **UP**:\n  - +1 guaranteed apple (nice).\n  - But pushes us to the top wall, only 2 exits, less aggression.\n- **RIGHT**:\n  - No apple now, but:\n  - Keeps 3 exits.\n  - Puts us right next to the enemy lane.\n  - Creates an immediate **winning** head-on possibility he has to respect.\n\nAnd remember our marching orders:\n- \u201cDo not focus on where the apples are. Focus on where the enemy is.\u201d\n- \u201cTry to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\u201d\n\nRIGHT lines up **perfectly** with that. We threaten the double KO **on our terms** while keeping good mobility.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd3 Strategy note to future me\n\n- Stay glued to the enemy\u2019s side, one step off their lane, so any \u201cbrave\u201d move from them risks a **losing head-on**.\n- Use our length advantage as we grow to carve horizontal/vertical walls that limit their escape while always leaving ourselves 2\u20133 outs.\n- Whenever we\u2019re clearly ahead on apples, don\u2019t be afraid to walk into squares that create potential head-on ties\u2014they *can\u2019t* afford to take them, which hands us positional control.\n- Near term after this RIGHT: keep circling in the upper-middle rows (y\u22487\u20139, x\u22482\u20136) to both threaten him and be ready to snatch apples that increase our lead while we box him.\n\nRIGHT",

Focus on where the enemy is.\u201d\n- \u201cTry to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\u201d\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT obey that, but **RIGHT**:\n- Gives us better geometry to **dominate the column he\u2019s in**.\n- Keeps us in the upper-center sweet spot to herd him downward.\n- Maintains aggression while not over-committing to the wall.\n\nWe\u2019re up on apples, we WANT him to even *consider* that suicidal UP move. We\u2019re happy to trade everything for the dub. \ud83d\udca3\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategy note to future me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- Stay near the enemy\u2019s lane, ideally **one step above or beside** him so any \u201cbrave\u201d move risks a losing head-on.\n- Use our length lead as it grows to build vertical walls that push him down toward rows 0\u20133 while we patrol rows 6\u20139.\n- Whenever we can choose a move that:\n  - keeps 2\u20133 exits open,\n  - and offers a **possible winning head-on**,  \n  prefer it over pure apple-chasing.\n- From (4,8), look to:\n  - Drop to (4,7) later if it helps squeeze his vertical space.\n  - Or swing horizontally to start framing a box around his likely escape routes.\n\nWe play **aggressive, safe, and merciless**. If he steps wrong into our line, he\u2019s DONE. \ud83d\ude08\n\nRIGHT",

We stay SMALL while our rival is already bigger and closer to central apples.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udfe2 DOWN \u2192 (6,6) \ud83c\udf4e\n- Cell has an apple.\n- Not our body, not his body.\n- Enemy can\u2019t reach (6,6) in one move from (3,4), so no head-on.\n- We eat: length becomes 3, apples: 2 (tie with him).\n- New body: head (6,6) \u2192 (6,7) \u2192 (5,7).\n- Next-turn options from (6,6): LEFT (5,6), RIGHT (7,6), DOWN (6,5) \u2014 3 free spaces.\n- More central, a bit closer to him = more potential interaction sooner.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udfe2 RIGHT \u2192 (7,7) \ud83c\udf4e\n- Cell has an apple.\n- Not our body, not his body.\n- Enemy can\u2019t reach (7,7) from (3,4) in one move.\n- We eat: length 3, apples: 2 (tie).\n- New body: head (7,7) \u2192 (6,7) \u2192 (5,7).\n- Next-turn options from (7,7):\n  - UP \u2192 (7,8) (free)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (8,7) (another apple \ud83d\ude0f)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (7,6) (free)\n- AND we stay high and to the right, away from his immediate influence while farming.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Which safe move is BEST?\n\nWe want:\n- Stay alive (no throwing),\n- Catch up on apples,\n- Build a **huge** body on the right side to eventually box him into the lower-left.\n\nCompare the two apple moves:\n\n- **DOWN to (6,6)**:\n  - Gains 1 apple \u2705\n  - Goes more central, closer to enemy \u2705\n  - Slower access to more apples (need multiple moves to reach (7,7)/(8,7)) \u274c  \n\n- **RIGHT to (7,7)**:\n  - Gains 1 apple \u2705\n  - Immediately threatens a **second apple at (8,7)** next turn \u2705\n  - Maintains high-right dominance, far from any early head-on with a longer snake \u2705\n  - Still has 3 clear exits next turn (UP, RIGHT, DOWN) \u2705\n\nWhy rush into his zone when he\u2019s longer and we can vacuum up a rich apple line on the right first? We farm, we outscale, THEN we hunt. \ud83d\ude08\n\nSo the line is:\n- This turn: RIGHT to (7,7) \u2192 tie apples 2\u20132.\n- Next turn options: very likely slam RIGHT again to (8,7) for 3\u20132 lead, while still super safe and open.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategy note for future me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- Prioritize the **top-right farm route**: (7,7) \u2192 (8,7), then keep lanes open via UP/RIGHT/DOWN.\n- Do NOT take head-on collisions until we are **ahead on apples** (or clearly longer).\n- After we\u2019re bigger, start drifting DOWN from the right side to build a wide horizontal body that cuts the board in half and boxes him into the bottom-left.\n- Always leave at least 2 safe exits each turn; don\u2019t tunnel into the corner unless our body already secures the escape.\n\nRIGHT",

If he runs at us, he dies or we draw from a winning position.  \n- Always leave at least 2 safe exits; don\u2019t overfill the top-right corner without a clear escape route down or inward.\n\nright",

Good control, good flexibility.\n\nNow, what can the enemy do from (6,4)? Their legal moves:\n- UP \u2192 (6,5)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,4) \ud83c\udf4e\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,3)\n\nLet\u2019s walk through the juicy lines:\n\n#### If they go **UP to (6,5)**:\nEnd of this turn:\n- Us: head (7,6)\n- Them: head (6,5)\n\nNext turn:\n- Our options from (7,6):  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (6,6) \ud83c\udf4e  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (7,5)\n- Their options from (6,5):  \n  - UP \u2192 (6,6) \ud83c\udf4e  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (7,5)  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (5,5)\n\nNow look at the clashes:\n\n- Both go **(6,6)**:  \n  - Head-on on an apple.  \n  - Current apples: we 3, they 2 \u2192 both get +1 \u2192 4\u20133, both die \u2192 **we win the game**.  \n  That\u2019s a **forced winning double-KO** if they race for that central apple. Chef\u2019s kiss \ud83d\ude24\n\n- We go **DOWN (7,5)** and they go **RIGHT (7,5)**:  \n  - Head-on, no apple.  \n  - Apples: 3 vs 2 \u2192 both die \u2192 we still **win** 3\u20132.  \n  Another winning head-on available.\n\nSo by going LEFT now, if they push upward, we completely **dominate** the central fight: any direct clash is winning for us.\n\n#### If they go **RIGHT to (7,4)** (grabbing that apple):\nEnd of this turn:\n- Us: head (7,6), apples 3\n- Them: head (7,4), apples 3\n\nNext turn from (7,6):\n- We can:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (6,6) \ud83c\udf4e (safe, uncontested)  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (7,5) (risky if they go UP)\n\nFrom (7,4) they can:\n- UP \u2192 (7,5)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,4) \ud83c\udf4e\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,3) \ud83c\udf4e\n\nWe just **don\u2019t** go DOWN into a possible 7,5 head-on at equal score (that\u2019d be a draw).  \nInstead, we snap up **(6,6)** and stay **+1** again: 4\u20133, with central control.\n\n#### If they go **DOWN to (6,3)**:\nThey run away; we sit at (7,6) directly above, ready to:\n- Grab (6,6) \ud83c\udf4e,\n- Or step down toward them later for a box.\n\nAll of this while we\u2019re safely in the center with room to pivot. LEFT is **aggressive control** without throwing.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd3d DOWN \u2192 (8,5)\nCell (8,5) is empty \u2705\n\nBody after move:\n- Head (8,5), then (8,6),(8,7),(7,7)\n\nThis drops us toward the **big apple cluster** on row 4\u2026 but guess who\u2019s closer? The enemy at (6,4).\n\nTypical line:\n- They go RIGHT to (7,4) \ud83c\udf4e \u2192 apples: 3\u20133\n- Next turn they can hit (8,4) or (7,3), while we\u2019re only just arriving at (8,5).\n\nResult?\n- We walk into a low-space brawl near the bottom-right where **they\u2019ve already equalized**.  \n- Any future head-on around (8,4)/(9,4) risks a **draw**, not a win.\n\nAlso, from (8,5) our main profitable move is DOWN to (8,4) into their cluster \u2014 exactly where we don\u2019t want a fair fight right now.\n\nToo much \u201capple race\u201d, not enough **enemy control** \u274c\n\n---\n\n### \u27a1\ufe0f RIGHT \u2192 (9,6)\nCell (9,6) is empty \u2705\n\nBody after move:\n- Head (9,6), then (8,6),(8,7),(7,7)\n\nBut now we\u2019re glued to the **right wall**:\n- Next turn options from (9,6):\n  - UP \u2192 (9,7)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (9,5)\n  - LEFT is backwards (8,6) \u274c\n\nOnly **two** real options, and still far from the center. We give up central pressure and start sliding down the wall toward the same row-4 apples where the enemy is **already better positioned**.\n\nWall-hugging with fewer options and worse timing on apples? That\u2019s how **we** get boxed, not them \u274c\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Verdict: we go CENTRAL and THREATEN THE KILL \ud83d\ude08\n\nAmong safe moves:\n- **LEFT (7,6)**:\n  - Central control \u2705\n  - Keeps solid future options \u2705\n  - Creates immediate lines for **winning head-ons** if enemy climbs toward us \u2705\n  - Lets us later grab (6,6) if they drift right/down \u2705\n\nThis aligns perfectly with our gameplan:\n- Stay alive.\n- Maintain/extend the score lead.\n- Set up situations where any collision is on **our terms**, and we win even in a double-KO.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Note to future me (next few turns plan) \ud83e\udde0\n\nFrom **(7,6)**:\n- If their next move is **UP to (6,5)**:\n  - Strongly consider going **onto (6,6)** to either:\n    - Force a **winning head-on on the apple**, or  \n    - Take free central space and extend our lead.\n- If they instead go **RIGHT to (7,4)**:\n  - Prioritize **(6,6)** over diving straight down; keep our **+1 apple** edge and central dominance.\n- If they run **DOWN to (6,3)**:\n  - Use our height and central pillar to gradually push down and left, aiming to **cut off their escape routes** and steer them into a losing collision with our body.\n\nWe\u2019re the hammer now.

That\u2019s exactly the kind of aggression we want.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83e\uddee Case 2: Enemy goes RIGHT \u2192 (8,4) (apple)\nEnd of this turn:\n- Us: head (6,6), apples **4**\n- Them: head (8,4), apples **4** (they eat)\n\nScore is **4\u20134**, but:\n- We\u2019re higher and more central (6,6).\n- They\u2019re lower and drifting toward the lower-right cluster and wall.\n\nWe:\n- Keep **more flexible space** (UP/LEFT/DOWN all open).\n- Can later drift down to **box them from above** as they snake around the bottom apples.\n- Still can engineer **favorable collisions**, because we\u2019re in the better part of the map.\n\nThis is **strictly better** than DOWN-then-watch-them-get-4-3 on us.\n\n---\n\n#### \ud83e\uddee Case 3: Enemy goes DOWN \u2192 (7,3) (apple)\nEnd of this turn:\n- Us: head (6,6), apples **4**\n- Them: head (7,3), apples **4**\n\nThey run away downward; we sit above them with a long body stretching right.

LEFT is the power move.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Note to future me (next few turns \ud83d\udcd3)\n\nFrom **(6,6)** after this move:\n- If enemy ended at **(7,5)**:\n  - Look hard at whether we can threaten or take **(6,5)** as a **winning head-on square**.\n  - Keep at least **two safe outs** each turn so we don\u2019t get boxed ourselves.\n- If enemy runs to **(8,4)** or **(7,3)**:\n  - Stay slightly **above and between** them and the open space.\n  - Aim to slowly **push them toward the bottom/right wall**, growing when safe, and set up a situation where they **must** either:\n    - Crash into our body, or\n    - Take a **losing head-on**.\n\nLet\u2019s eat, thicken the body, and turn the whole mid-board into a minefield for this clown \ud83e\udde8\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

I\u2019m not giving him a free lane, I\u2019m taking another segment so I can keep that corridor clean while the rival has to worry about my tail chasing the east wall.\n\nPlan: after picking up (9,4), stay on that eastern spine, ladder up to (9,5)/(9,6) to seal the column, and force them into a head-on as soon as they overcommit.  \nRIGHT",

We can\u2019t contest it this turn. So our best counterplay is to:\n- Use our position above to farm the top cluster quickly.\n- Build a size/score lead via the northern apples.\n- Later swoop down to compress them against the bottom/right.\n\nNearest good apple for us: (6,8) straight above.\n- From current (6,6):\n  - If we go UP now \u2192 we\u2019re one step away from (6,8) next turn.\n  - If we go LEFT or DOWN, it\u2019s 3 steps away instead.\n\n### Compare candidates\n\n#### DOWN (6,5)\n- Pros:\n  - Drifts toward their half, \u201caggressive.\u201d\n- Cons:\n  - Only two safe directions next turn (left/right).\n  - Puts us directly over their body line at y=4 while still tied 4\u20134.\n  - Higher risk of getting into close-quarters trading before we\u2019ve built a score lead.\n\u2192 Too cramped, too close to them too early. Skip it.\n\n#### LEFT (5,6)\n- Pros:\n  - 3 safe exits next turn.\n  - Keeps vertical separation from enemy.\n  - Moves toward apple at (1,6).\n- Cons:\n  - Slower route to our best easy apple (6,8).\n  - Slightly drifts us away from top-center control where there are multiple apples.\n\n#### UP (6,7)\n- Pros:\n  - 3 safe exits next turn: UP to (6,8), LEFT to (5,7), RIGHT to (7,7).\n  - Direct setup to eat (6,8) in one more move \u2013 fast, safe apple to keep pace with or catch the enemy.\n  - Keeps us above and slightly away from the enemy, preserving positional advantage and avoiding immediate collision lanes.\n  - Our body at x=6\u20138, y=6\u20137 becomes a nice mid-board wall later for boxing them beneath us.\n\n- Cons:\n  - We temporarily let them farm (9,4) and possibly (9,3) uncontested \u2013 but we answer by farming the top cluster, not diving into a brawl while tied.\n\nGiven all that, UP is the most \u201con brand\u201d: safe, flexible, and sets up fast scoring from the northern apples while maintaining board control above the opponent.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Short plan for future turns\n\n- Next: likely take (6,8) to keep up in score while staying high and central.\n- After that, path into the dense top cluster: (2,8), (2,9), (4,9), maybe (9,9) if routing right is safe.\n- Use our growing body as a vertical wall in the 6\u20138 x-columns to keep the enemy sliding along the bottom/right.\n- Once we\u2019re up a point or two, start deliberately steering toward lines where a head-on in a choke corridor is possible and winning for us.\n\nUP",

Let\u2019s dissect this.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Our head: (6,7)  \n- Our body: (6,6) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (8,6) \u2192 (8,7)  \n- Our apples: 4  \n- Enemy head: (9,4)  \n- Enemy body: (8,4) \u2192 (7,4) \u2192 (6,4) \u2192 (5,4) \u2192 (4,4)  \n- Enemy apples: 5  \n\nWe\u2019re down by 1, board is still wide open, and we\u2019re sitting right above mid.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Check all four moves\n\nHead at (6,7):\n\n**UP \u2192 (6,8)**  \n- Board shows an apple at (6,8).  \n- That square is empty of all snake bodies.  \n- No way enemy reaches (6,8) this turn from (9,4).  \n\u2192 Safe, and we eat an apple. Strong contender.\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (6,6)**  \n- That is our own body segment directly behind our head.  \n\u2192 Moving DOWN is an instant self-kill. Illegal.\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (5,7)**  \n- (5,7) is empty right now.  \n- Enemy is far at (9,4); they can\u2019t contest that square this turn.  \n\u2192 LEFT is safe this turn.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (7,7)**  \n- (7,7) is empty right now.  \n- Enemy too far to collide there this turn.  \n\u2192 RIGHT is safe this turn.\n\nSo legal moves: **UP, LEFT, RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Future safety / flexibility\n\nWe have to think not just \u201cam I alive now?\u201d but \u201chow boxed am I next turn?\u201d\n\nAssume the enemy plays sensibly:\n\nFrom (9,4) they can:\n- UP \u2192 (9,5) (empty), or  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,3) (apple).  \n\nDOWN grabs an apple and is still safe with two exits, so expect them to trend **DOWN** toward the (9,3)/(7,3) cluster. Either way, they stay far from us this turn and the next.\n\nNow our options:\n\n**If we go UP to (6,8):**\n- New head: (6,8) on an apple \u2192 we grow, apples = 5.\n- Our body becomes: (6,8),(6,7),(6,6),(7,6),(8,6),(8,7).\n- Next-turn neighbors:\n  - UP (6,9): empty.\n  - LEFT (5,8): empty.\n  - RIGHT (7,8): empty.\n  - DOWN (6,7): our own neck (blocked).\n\u2192 We keep **3 safe exits** and we grab a point immediately. Also we sit just under the top row near a whole cluster of apples.\n\n**If we go LEFT to (5,7):**\n- Body next turn: (5,7),(6,7),(6,6),(7,6),(8,6).\n- Next-turn neighbors:\n  - UP (5,8): empty.\n  - LEFT (4,7): empty.\n  - DOWN (5,6): empty.\n  - RIGHT (6,7): neck (blocked).\n\u2192 Also **3 safe exits**, but no apple this turn, and we\u2019re now 2 moves away from that juicy (6,8) instead of 1.\n\n**If we go RIGHT to (7,7):**\n- Body next turn: (7,7),(6,7),(6,6),(7,6),(8,6).\n- Next-turn neighbors:\n  - UP (7,8): empty.\n  - RIGHT (8,7): will be empty (our tail vacates).\n  - LEFT (6,7): neck (blocked).\n  - DOWN (7,6): body (blocked).\n\u2192 Only **2 safe exits** (UP, RIGHT). Less flexibility, and still no apple.\n\nSo purely on survivability/future options:\n- UP and LEFT are best (3 exits),\n- RIGHT is strictly worse (2 exits).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Score pressure and aggression\n\nWe\u2019re **down 4\u20135**. If enemy goes DOWN for (9,3) this turn:\n- If we go UP and eat (6,8):  \n  - Our apples: 5  \n  - Their apples: 6  \n  \u2192 We\u2019re only down 1 and we just extended our body across the mid-top.\n- If we go LEFT or RIGHT and don\u2019t eat:  \n  - Our apples: 4  \n  - Their apples: 6  \n  \u2192 Now we\u2019re down 2 for no positional compensation.\n\nWe absolutely do **not** want a head-on trade while we\u2019re behind; they\u2019d win the game in any double-KO right now. That means our first priority is to **catch up in apples** while keeping them pushed into the bottom-right.\n\nUP does exactly that:\n- Safe apple now.\n- Keeps us high and central.\n- Builds a thicker vertical wall around x=6\u20138 to later box them beneath us.\n\nLEFT is safe but timid: delays our scoring and doesn\u2019t actually pressure the enemy. RIGHT drifts us toward them with less flexibility and no apple. For an \u201caggressive but smart\u201d line, UP is the clear play.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Short long-term plan (note to future self)\n\n- Immediately: Eat the (6,8) apple with **UP** to stay close in score and build mass.  \n- Next few turns:  \n  - Use our high position to sweep the top cluster: (2,8) \u2192 (2,9) \u2192 (4,9) and maybe across toward (9,9) if lanes stay open.  \n  - Maintain a strong vertical body in central columns (around x=5\u20137) to form a wall separating us from the enemy\u2019s bottom-right quadrant.  \n- Midgame:  \n  - Once we secure a **score lead**, start steering down and right, shrinking their available space.  \n  - Look for tight corridors where a head-on collision would be forced and **winning** for us because of our apple advantage.  \n  - Never let them slip above us; always keep our head higher or more central than theirs.\n\nWe take the clean apple and tighten the noose later.\n\nUP",

Any double-KO right now is a **draw**, not a win. We want MORE.\n\nApples on our side of town:\n- Top/left-ish: (2,8), (2,9), (4,9)\n- Top/right: (9,9)\n- Mid-right near enemy: (7,5)\n- Others are low; we\u2019ll worry about those later.\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all 4 moves from (6,8)\n\n**UP \u2192 (6,9)**  \n- On board, (6,9) is empty, no apple.\n- Not our own body, not enemy body, in-bounds.  \n\u2705 Immediately safe.\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (6,7)**  \n- That\u2019s our own neck.  \n\u274c Instant suicide, illegal.\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (5,8)**  \n- (5,8) is empty.\n- Not in enemy\u2019s body.\n\u2705 Immediately safe.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (7,8)**  \n- (7,8) is empty.\n- Not in enemy\u2019s body.\n\u2705 Immediately safe.\n\nSo candidates: **UP, LEFT, RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What can the enemy do?\n\nEnemy head at (9,5). Their legal moves:\n\n- UP \u2192 (9,6) (empty, no apple)\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,5) (empty now, aims toward apple at (7,5))\n- DOWN is backward into (9,4) \u274c\n- RIGHT is off-board \u274c\n\nSo they realistically choose between:\n- **UP** to try to climb toward (9,9), or  \n- **LEFT** to angle for (7,5) and stay off the top wall.\n\nNo matter what we pick (UP/LEFT/RIGHT), there is **no possible head-on collision this turn**:\n- Our UP/LEFT/RIGHT squares: (6,9), (5,8), (7,8)\n- Their UP/LEFT squares: (9,6), (8,5)  \nNone of those overlap. So everything we\u2019re evaluating is safe **this** turn.\n\nGood.

Nearest meaningful apple:\n- (9,9) in ~3 moves (RIGHT \u2192 UP \u2192 RIGHT)\nBut notice this: going RIGHT drifts us **toward** the enemy side, closer to where they may climb up from (9,6)/(8,5). We\u2019re equal in score; forcing early scrappy fights near them when there are *safer* apples available elsewhere is not optimal yet.\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Score, aggression, and boxing strategy\n\nWe\u2019re **tied 5\u20135**. A head-on double KO right now? That\u2019s just a **draw**. Boring. We want to **farm up**, then use our bigger body as a weapon.\n\nStrategic goals:\n- Stay alive (duh).\n- Farm apples in areas the enemy can\u2019t contest easily.\n- Use our length to **wall off central lanes**, forcing them into tighter corridors.\n- Once we\u2019re **ahead in apples**, we actively look for head-on or \u201crun into my body\u201d traps.\n\nMoving **LEFT** accomplishes more of that:\n- Keeps us high and central-left, away from immediate conflict but still dominating the **middle columns** with our existing vertical stack around x=6.\n- Sets up a fast path to **(4,9)** and then potentially **(2,9)/(2,8)**, building a long body that can later swing down and seal off their escape routes from the bottom-right.\n- Enemy will likely move **LEFT to (8,5)** for the apple at (7,5) next; that keeps them low-right while we quietly take over the top-left and mid.\n\nGoing **UP** is too stiff on the top wall for no apple.  \nGoing **RIGHT** pushes us closer to them without a clear tactical payoff yet.\n\n---\n\n## 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Note to future self \ud83e\udde0\n\n- Short term (next 3\u20135 turns):  \n  - Move LEFT now, then aim to climb to **(4,9)** and then toward **(2,9)/(2,8)**.  \n  - Keep our vertical stack around x=6 intact as a **central barrier**.\n- Mid term:  \n  - Once we\u2019ve got a **clear apple lead**, start drifting back toward the right side, aiming to create a vertical wall that cuts them off from the top.  \n  - Try to shepherd them into the **bottom-right quadrant** and reduce their exits.\n  - When we\u2019re comfortably ahead, look for lines that **force** a head-on if they try to escape. If they\u2019re trapped between our body and the wall, they either crash or take a losing collision.\n\nWe play it smart NOW so we can play it ruthless LATER. Move is clear.\n\nLEFT",

Not allowed.\n\nSo candidate moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nEnemy from (9,6):\n- UP -> (9,7) safe.\n- LEFT -> (8,6) safe (we\u2019re vacating (8,6) this turn no matter what we do).\n- DOWN is backwards, RIGHT is off-board.\n\nNone of their legal moves can reach (5,9), (5,7), or (4,8) this turn, so no head-on risk right now.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 2 \u2013 Evaluate each safe move\n\n1) UP -> (5,9)\n- New body: head (5,9), then (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (7,6).\n- Next-turn options:\n  - LEFT -> (4,9) apple\n  - RIGHT -> (6,9) empty\n  - UP off-board, DOWN into neck\n- Only 2 legal moves next turn.

We also move closer to the central lanes where enemy can contest more easily.\n\n3) LEFT -> (4,8)\n- New body: head (4,8), then (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (7,6).\n- Next-turn options:\n  - UP -> (4,9) apple\n  - LEFT -> (3,8) toward (2,8)\n  - DOWN -> (4,7)\n  - RIGHT into neck\n- We keep 3 real options and stay one row below the top wall. Still a direct path to the top-left apples, but with more flexibility.\n\nAll three keep us safe this turn. Only LEFT and UP meaningfully advance us toward that powerful top-left cluster. Between those, LEFT clearly gives us more future mobility.\n\n---\n\nSTEP 3 \u2013 Strategy vs enemy\n\nEnemy is on the right edge climbing up from (9,6). They\u2019ll likely:\n- Go UP toward (9,9), or\n- Go LEFT then down toward (7,5)\n\nEither way, they\u2019re playing on the right side. Our best play is to:\n- Farm the top-left where they can\u2019t contest quickly,\n- Grow our snake into a long wall from the upper-left and center,\n- Then use that extra length later to box them into the bottom-right and force them into our body or into a losing collision once we\u2019re ahead in apples.\n\nLEFT keeps our central column at x=6 intact as a barrier and sets up:\n- Immediate access to (4,9),\n- Then swing over to (2,9) and (2,8),\n- While maintaining 3 escape routes next turn.\n\nUP gives us the same apples in roughly the same time, but with fewer options and more wall-hugging. DOWN doesn\u2019t contest as many high-value apples and pulls us toward more chaotic central fights while we\u2019re only tied in score.\n\nSo we stay disciplined, keep the pressure, and keep our options open.\n\n---\n\nNote to future self (next few turns):\n- From (4,8), prioritize UP to (4,9) to secure that apple.\n- After that, look to chain into (2,9) and (2,8), building a big top-left body.\n- Keep the spine around x=6 as a central barrier; do NOT collapse your own escape routes.\n- Only start drifting back toward the enemy for aggressive traps once we\u2019re up at least +1 apple.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy\u2019s stuck on the right side, miles away. Perfect spot to snowball.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from (4,8)\n\nFrom our head (4,8):\n\n- UP -> (4,9)\n  - In bounds \u2705  \n  - Apple there \u2705  \n  - Not our body \u2705  \n  - Not enemy body \u2705  \n  \u21d2 SAFE and +1 apple.\n\n- DOWN -> (4,7)\n  - In bounds \u2705  \n  - Empty \u2705  \n  - Not our body \u2705  \n  - Not enemy body \u2705  \n  \u21d2 SAFE.\n\n- LEFT -> (3,8)\n  - In bounds \u2705  \n  - Empty \u2705  \n  - Not our body \u2705  \n  - Not enemy body \u2705  \n  \u21d2 SAFE.\n\n- RIGHT -> (5,8)\n  - That\u2019s our neck \u274c  \n  - Instant backwards self-bonk = death \u2620\ufe0f  \n  \u21d2 ILLEGAL.\n\nSo candidates: **UP, DOWN, LEFT**.\n\nNow, what can the enemy do from (9,7)?\n\n- UP -> (9,8) \u2705\n- LEFT -> (8,7) \u2705\n- DOWN -> (9,6) (their own neck) \u274c  \n- RIGHT -> (10,7) offboard \u274c  \n\nSo they can only go to (9,8) or (8,7). Neither comes anywhere near our candidate squares (4,9), (4,7), or (3,8).  \n\u21d2 **No head-on collision risk this turn** no matter what we pick.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Evaluate each safe move\n\n#### \ud83d\udd3c Option A: UP -> (4,9) (APPLE)\n\nWe eat the apple at (4,9). Tail does **not** move this turn.\n\nNew body:\n- Head: (4,9)\n- Then: (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (7,6)\n\nNext turn options from (4,9):\n- UP -> (4,10): offboard \u274c  \n- DOWN -> (4,8): into our neck (backwards) \u274c  \n- LEFT -> (3,9): empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT -> (5,9): empty \u2705  \n\nSo we\u2019ll have **2 safe moves** next turn, plus:\n- Immediate score lead: 6\u20135 \ud83d\ude0e  \n- Still tons of space along the whole top row and down the left side.\n- Direct lines to more apples: (2,9) and (2,8) just a short slide away.\n\nWe hug the top wall a bit, but after one step (e.g. LEFT to (3,9)), we regain 3-way flexibility.\n\n#### \u2b05\ufe0f Option B: LEFT -> (3,8)\n\nNo apple, so we move head + shift tail.\n\nNew body:\n- Head: (3,8)\n- Then: (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6)  \n  (tail (7,6) vacates)\n\nNext turn options from (3,8):\n- UP -> (3,9): empty \u2705  \n- DOWN -> (3,7): empty \u2705  \n- LEFT -> (2,8): apple \u2705  \n- RIGHT -> (4,8): our neck \u274c  \n\nSo **3 safe moves** next turn and immediate adjacency to (2,8). Very flexible and still pointed at the same juicy cluster\u2026 but we **don\u2019t** get the guaranteed apple this turn. Score would remain 5\u20135.\n\n#### \ud83d\udd3d Option C: DOWN -> (4,7)\n\nNew body:\n- Head: (4,7)\n- Then: (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6)  \n  (tail (7,6) vacates)\n\nNext turn options from (4,7):\n- UP -> (4,8): neck \u274c  \n- DOWN -> (4,6): empty \u2705  \n- LEFT -> (3,7): empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT -> (5,7): empty \u2705  \n\nSo **3 safe moves** too. But:\n- We move AWAY from the top-left apple jackpot (2,9, 2,8, 4,9).\n- We drift toward the messy central area where enemy can eventually contest.\n\nWhy bail on the high ground and free apples when the enemy is stuck on the far right? \ud83e\udd28\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategic choice: tempo vs flexibility\n\nKey points:\n- We\u2019re tied 5\u20135. A head-on kill right now = **draw**, which we do NOT want. We want to **snowball** a lead first, then force collisions later when we\u2019re ahead.\n- The enemy is on the right edge at (9,7), likely racing **up** to the apple at (9,9). They are **nowhere near** the top-left cluster.\n- The top-left apples (4,9), (2,9), (2,8) are basically FREE REAL ESTATE for us \ud83c\udfe1\n\nSo what\u2019s better **right now**:\n- LEFT gives us slightly more flexibility next turn, **but no apple this turn**.\n- UP gives us an immediate apple, a scoreboard lead, and still leaves 2 safe continuations and a wide-open top row to roam.\n\nWe can afford one slightly \u201ctighter\u201d turn on the wall when the payoff is grabbing the uncontested apple and going **6\u20135**. Next turn, we can immediately move LEFT along the top row and regain extra options while continuing the farm.\n\nWe\u2019re not in a cramped corridor; the entire top-left and left side are open. Taking UP now is aggressive tempo: we get ahead on points and still set up to chain into (2,9) and (2,8) after.\n\nSo we **snap-take** the apple and start the snowball \ud83d\ude24\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Note to future self (next few turns)\n\n- From (4,9), **move away from the top wall quickly**, likely LEFT to (3,9), to restore 3-way mobility.\n- Prioritize securing **(2,9)** and **(2,8)** next; build a long, thick body across the **top-left and upper center**.\n- Keep that spine around x\u22485\u20136 as a central barrier. Goal: eventually create a horizontal/diagonal wall that cuts the enemy off into the right side.\n- Only look for **forced head-on collisions** once we\u2019re clearly ahead in apples (at least +1, ideally +2) so a mass KO ends in our favor.\n- Do NOT over-tighten in the corner near (0,9)/(0,8); always leave yourself at least two escape lanes back toward the center.\n\nUP",

LEFT to (7,7) might feel spicy, but it leaves us looking at enemy body blocks at (6,7)/(7,6) and only one escape (UP) on the next turn\u2014no, thanks. UP to (8,8) keeps THREE solid exit lanes (LEFT, RIGHT, UP) and lets us start wrapping around the northern real estate to hem the rival into that cramped upper-left quadrant while still keeping multiple safe routes open. That\u2019s the smart flex\u2014aggression with options, not aggression with a blindside.\n\n**Plan note:** After climbing into (8,8), I\u2019m going to circle left along the top row to start sealing off his exit toward the center, keep stalking that head at (4,9), and only bite into apples when I\u2019m already boxing him in.

That shoves us along the top row toward the enemy with zero choice for one turn.\n\nAfter we go to (6,9) we eventually regain a second option (at (7,9) we can go DOWN), but:\n- We\u2019re locked on the top wall for a couple turns.\n- We move **toward** the enemy side without getting immediate apples for it.\n- We\u2019re building a horizontal wall on y=9, but it\u2019s a bit early and a bit risky to commit so hard to the top right while the enemy still has tons of space below.\n\nIs pushing into a potentially tight top-right race **worth** sacrificing our easy apple farm on the left?

Time to cook again.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Step 1: Check all 4 moves from (3,9)\n\nCurrent us:\n- Head: (3,9)\n- Body: (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6)\n\nEnemy:\n- Head: (8,8)\n- Body: (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4)\n\nFrom our head (3,9):\n\n#### \ud83d\udd3c UP \u2192 (3,10)\n- Off the 0\u20139 board.\n- Instant throw. \u274c\n\n#### \ud83d\udd3d DOWN \u2192 (3,8)\n- On board.\n- Not in our body.\n- Not in enemy body.\n- Enemy possible moves from (8,8): (8,9), (7,8), (9,8) \u2014 none are (3,8).\n- So no head-on or body collision this turn.\n- **SAFE** \u2705 (no apple, we shrink tail at (6,6)).\n\n#### \u2b05\ufe0f LEFT \u2192 (2,9)\n- On board.\n- There\u2019s an **apple** at (2,9) \ud83c\udf4e.\n- Not in our body, not in enemy body.\n- Enemy options (8,9), (7,8), (9,8); none are (2,9).\n- Safe this turn, *and* we grow +1 and keep our tail at (6,6).\n- **SAFE + VALUE** \u2705\n\n#### \u27a1\ufe0f RIGHT \u2192 (4,9)\n- That\u2019s our **neck**.\n- Direct backwards move = self-KO. \u274c\n\nSo **legal moves** this turn: **LEFT** and **DOWN**.\n\n---\n\n### \u265f\ufe0f Step 2: Compare LEFT vs DOWN (space control + future options)\n\nWe\u2019re up **6\u20135**, so:\n- Any future **head-on double KO** is *good for us*\u2026 as long as we\u2019re still ahead when it happens.\n- But we don\u2019t suicide into *random* collisions \u2014 we build a fat, high-score snake and then **force** them into bad trades.\n\n#### Option A: LEFT \u2192 (2,9) (apple)\n\nIf we go LEFT:\n- New body (we eat, so no tail shrink):\n  - Head: (2,9)\n  - Then: (3,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6)\n\nNext turn from (2,9):\n\n- UP \u2192 (2,10): offboard \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,9): neck \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,8): **apple** \ud83c\udf4e \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,9): empty \u2705  \n\nSo we still have **2 good options**, including a **second guaranteed apple** at (2,8) the very next turn.\n\nBig pluses here:\n- We jump to **7\u20135** this turn (enemy has no adjacent apple right now).\n- We **keep** our tail at (6,6) one more turn, reinforcing that vertical strip around x=6 that helps partition the board.\n- We\u2019re sitting on a whole **left-side apple farm**: (2,9), (2,8), (0,7), (1,6). Enemy is miles away on the right \u2014 they aren\u2019t contesting this.\n\nThis line = **faster snowball**, stronger body, and we preserve the central \u201cspine\u201d near x=6 for longer.\n\n#### Option B: DOWN \u2192 (3,8)\n\nIf we go DOWN:\n- New body (no apple, tail shrinks):\n  - Head: (3,8)\n  - Then: (3,9), (4,9), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7)\n  - Tail at (6,6) disappears.\n\nNext turn from (3,8):\n\n- UP \u2192 (3,9): neck \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,8): our body \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,7): empty \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,8): **apple** \ud83c\udf4e \u2705  \n\nSo we again get **2 options** with an apple next turn, but:\n- We **lose** the tail at (6,6), slightly weakening our central wall.\n- We delay our 7th apple by one turn compared to the LEFT path.\n- We don\u2019t get any closer to the enemy in a meaningful way (we\u2019re still far left, they\u2019re still far right).\n\nSo DOWN is safe, still gives us apples, but:\n- Less growth **this** turn.\n- Slightly **less** board control in the center (we drop that (6,6) segment).\n- No real compensating aggression toward the enemy yet.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Strategic call\n\nWhat do we want, chat?\n\n- We want to be **longer and ahead** when we finally set up a **forced head-on**.\n- We want to **slice the board** so the enemy gets squeezed into the right side.\n- We\u2019re already positioned to farm a **left/top apple chain** basically uncontested.\n\n**LEFT**:\n- +1 apple *immediately* \u2192 likely 7\u20135.\n- Keeps more of our central body intact for one more turn.\n- Keeps 2+ safe follow-up moves and sets up a clean second apple at (2,8).\n- Lets us continue the plan from last turn: thicken the upper-left, then drop a wall through the mid to box them into the right.\n\n**DOWN**:\n- Also safe, but strictly worse tempo and central control right now.\n\nSo we **cram that apple** at (2,9), keep that sweet central spine a bit longer, and keep snowballing. We\u2019ll bully them later with length and score and then look for the **winning head-on corridor** \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Future self game plan (next few turns)\n\n- From (2,9), strongly favor **DOWN to (2,8)** to chain apples and push to 8+ apples while enemy is still at 5\u20136.\n- After (2,8), work down/diagonal toward y\u22487\u20136 and x\u22483\u20135 to rebuild a **horizontal/diagonal wall** across the upper-middle.\n- Keep at least **two exit lanes** whenever near the left edge; don\u2019t fully corner yourself at x=0.\n- Once we\u2019re up **2\u20133 apples**, start drifting back toward center-right, seeking corridors where the enemy has only two options:  \n  - crash into us, or  \n  - get sealed into a tiny right-side box they can\u2019t escape.\n\nLEFT",

Nope.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down: LEFT is blocked by his body at (6,8), RIGHT is my own spine, DOWN leads straight into the packed column where our neck at (8,7) is already itching for another disaster. Only UP keeps us from getting boxed\u2014moving to (7,9) keeps us hugging the top row and gives us two real follow-up choices (LEFT or RIGHT) while forcing him to think about head-on options near his neck instead of sneaking past us.

No way, I want to control the air and bait him into crashing, not hand him the chokehold on a silver platter \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc80\n\nBy climbing to (7,9) we keep the pressure on that skinny corridor around (6,9) and (5,9) and make sure he can\u2019t just swing through the center unchallenged. We\u2019re still trailing, but we\u2019re not scared\u2014we\u2019re hunting for his mistake and ready to dish out a head-on if he tries to brute-force the flank. Should he try to snake around our tail we\u2019re already set up to cut off his scenic route. This is how we dominate the north side.\n\nPLAN NOTE: Stay on the top edge, keep that pressure dialing on the enemy neck, and make any move that forces him into the wider open without letting him breathe\u2014if he commits toward us we\u2019re ready to square up for that head-on and flip the score.\n\nUP",

That walks them over the top of our wall and toward center-left.\n\n- \u27a1\ufe0f RIGHT \u2192 (8,9)\n  - On-board, empty.\n  - From (8,9) next turn, only safe cell is **RIGHT \u2192 (9,9)** (apple \ud83c\udf4e), because:\n    - DOWN = (8,8) their own body\n    - LEFT = neck\n    - UP = off-board\n  - So this line pushes them into the **top-right corner** but gives them an apple (they\u2019d go to 6 points).\n\nThey **cannot**:\n- Go UP (off-board)\n- Go DOWN (into their own neck at (7,8))\n\nSo they\u2019re forced to drift along the **top row**, either toward 6,9 then 5,9, or toward the 9,9 apple.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Our move options from (2,8)\n\nCheck all four like pros:\n\n### \u2b06\ufe0f UP \u2192 (2,9)\n- That\u2019s our **neck**.\n- Moving directly backwards = **instant self-KO**. \ud83d\udc80  \n- Auto-throw. \u274c\n\n### \u2b05\ufe0f LEFT \u2192 (1,8)\n- Cell (1,8) is empty, no apple, no bodies.\n- Enemy can\u2019t reach it this turn.\n- **Safe.** \u2705\n- After this move, tail at (6,6) disappears, so our new body is:\n  - (1,8) \u2192 (2,8) \u2192 (2,9) \u2192 (3,9) \u2192 (4,9) \u2192 (4,8) \u2192 (5,8) \u2192 (6,8) \u2192 (6,7)\n- Next turn from (1,8):\n  - UP \u2192 (1,9) empty \u2705\n  - DOWN \u2192 (1,7) empty \u2705\n  - LEFT \u2192 (0,8) empty \u2705\n  - RIGHT \u2192 neck \u274c\n- So **3 safe exits** next turn, nice.\n- But\u2026 we\u2019re drifting toward the **top-left corner**, away from center control. That gives the enemy more room to wiggle under/around us later. Not very dominant, right? \ud83e\udd28\n\n### \u27a1\ufe0f RIGHT \u2192 (3,8)\n- Cell (3,8) is empty, no bodies, no apple.\n- Safe this turn. \u2705\n- New snake after tail (6,6) moves:\n  - (3,8) \u2192 (2,8) \u2192 (2,9) \u2192 (3,9) \u2192 (4,9) \u2192 (4,8) \u2192 (5,8) \u2192 (6,8) \u2192 (6,7)\n- Now look at **next turn** from (3,8):\n  - UP \u2192 (3,9) = our own body \u274c\n  - LEFT \u2192 (2,8) = neck \u274c\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (4,8) = our body \u274c\n  - DOWN \u2192 (3,7) = empty \u2705\n- So moving RIGHT **forces us into a single move next turn** (DOWN). That\u2019s a mini-tunnel. Do we really want to lock ourselves like that when we\u2019re winning and can just play it smooth? Risky. \ud83d\ude05\n\n### \u2b07\ufe0f DOWN \u2192 (2,7)\n- Cell (2,7) is empty, no apple, no bodies.\n- Safe this turn. \u2705\n- New snake after tail (6,6) moves:\n  - (2,7) \u2192 (2,8) \u2192 (2,9) \u2192 (3,9) \u2192 (4,9) \u2192 (4,8) \u2192 (5,8) \u2192 (6,8) \u2192 (6,7)\n- Our central wall stays strong: we still own x=6 at y=7\u20138 and the top row at x=2\u20134.\n- Next turn from (2,7):\n  - UP \u2192 neck (2,8) \u274c\n  - LEFT \u2192 (1,7) empty \u2705\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (3,7) empty \u2705\n  - DOWN \u2192 (2,6) empty \u2705\n- **Three good exits** and now we\u2019re slightly **lower**, giving us more vertical room to loop under him and tighter control of the middle.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Comparing the safe moves\n\nWe\u2019ve got **three** safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN. Let\u2019s rank them like killers \ud83d\ude08\n\n- \ud83d\udd3b **RIGHT (3,8)**  \n  - Pros: moves us slightly toward center.\n  - Cons: forces our next move (only DOWN), which can be super dangerous long-term if the board gets crowded. Low flexibility = bad in Snake.\n\n- \ud83d\udd3b **LEFT (1,8)**\n  - Pros: very flexible next turn (3 exits).\n  - Cons: drifts us into **top-left corner**, away from controlling the center and away from the enemy. That makes it easier for him to slip around later. We\u2019re ahead; we should be **dominating center**, not bailing to a corner.\n\n- \u2705 **DOWN (2,7)** \u2014 best balance\n  - Keeps our **central wall** intact.\n  - Opens **3 future options** (LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN).\n  - Lowers us a row so we can:\n    - Curve under him later,\n    - Expand our \u201cbox\u201d around the right side,\n    - And stay super hard to trap ourselves.\n  - Still keeps us far from any silly head-on this turn (we\u2019d gladly take a head-on when it\u2019s forced and we\u2019re up 8\u20135, but no need to coinflip prematurely).\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Mini long-term plan to Future Me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- Keep building a **thick spine** around x\u22484\u20136 and y\u22485\u20138 so that the **right side becomes his prison**.\n- Use our extra length to **wrap underneath** him later, cutting off his escape to the lower half of the board.\n- Always leave at least **two safe exits** from our head so we don\u2019t self-box while trying to box him.\n- If we grow the lead even more and get a clean line to a **forced head-on**, we absolutely take it \u2013 we win the tie on apples. \ud83d\udca3\n\nWe drop **DOWN** here, stay central, stay flexible, and keep the cage closing. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83e\uddf1\n\nDOWN",

We want to stay alive, stay flexible, and keep the pressure on.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Where can the enemy go?\n\nEnemy at (9,9):\n\n- UP \u2192 (9,10): off-board, dead.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10,9): off-board, dead.\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,9): into their own body, dead.\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,8): empty.\n\nSo they are forced DOWN to (9,8) this turn. No way they can reach us or set up a head-on this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all our moves\n\nFrom our head (3,7):\n\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,7): directly backwards into our neck. Instant self-KO. Illegal.\n- UP \u2192 (3,8): looks empty now, but what happens next turn?\n\n  If we move to (3,8), after our move our body wraps around us:\n  - Adjacent to (3,8) will be:\n    - (3,9): our body\n    - (3,7): our body\n    - (2,8): our body\n    - (4,8): our body  \n\n  Next turn we would have **zero legal moves**. That\u2019s a guaranteed self-box in one turn. That\u2019s effectively suicide. So UP is out.\n\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,6):\n  - (3,6) is empty.\n  - After moving there, neighbors next turn would be:\n    - LEFT \u2192 (2,6): empty\n    - RIGHT \u2192 (4,6): empty\n    - DOWN \u2192 (3,5): empty\n    - UP \u2192 (3,7): our body  \n\n  That\u2019s **3 safe exits** next turn. Very flexible, and it starts to tilt us downward toward the big open middle.\n\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,7):\n  - (4,7) is empty.\n  - After moving there, neighbors next turn:\n    - DOWN \u2192 (4,6): empty\n    - RIGHT \u2192 (5,7): empty\n    - LEFT \u2192 (3,7): our neck (illegal)\n    - UP \u2192 (4,8): our body  \n\n  That\u2019s **2 safe exits** (DOWN, RIGHT). Slightly fewer options than DOWN, but still decent.\n\nSo the only viable moves this turn are: **DOWN** and **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 DOWN vs RIGHT \u2013 which squeezes him harder?\n\nWhat is the enemy doing while we choose?\n\n- This turn: forced to (9,8).\n- Next turn from (9,8), they are forced again to (9,7).\n- After that, at (9,7), they\u2019ll have a choice to go LEFT to (8,7) or DOWN to (9,6) as their body frees up.\n\nSo in 2\u20133 turns, he\u2019ll be sliding down the right wall and then looking to escape left toward the center.\n\nDo we want to be drifting away from him, or shifting toward him to threaten a box and possible head-on when we\u2019re ahead 8\u20136?\n\n- **DOWN to (3,6):**\n  - Maximum flexibility (3 outs next turn).\n  - Moves us a bit away vertically from his current cluster and keeps us at x=3.\n  - Good long-term central position, but slightly more \u201cwait and see\u201d.\n\n- **RIGHT to (4,7):**\n  - Keeps us high and central.\n  - Moves us one step closer horizontally to the enemy corner.\n  - Sets up a nice follow-up:\n    - We can push further right (5,7, 6,7, \u2026) to meet him as he tries to come left.\n    - Or drop down from 4,7 to build a vertical wall cutting off his escape.\n\nWe\u2019re not in immediate danger of trapping ourselves if we go RIGHT; we retain at least two safe outs. And we are supposed to be aggressive and look for that eventual winning head-on if we can engineer it.\n\nSo: DOWN is safer, calmer; RIGHT is more dominant and keeps the squeeze on the right side where he\u2019s trapped.\n\nGiven we\u2019re ahead on apples and want to pressure him, we take the more aggressive but still safe option: **RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### Note to future self (next few turns)\n\n- Expect enemy path: (9,9) \u2192 (9,8) \u2192 (9,7), then likely probing LEFT or continuing DOWN.\n- From (4,7), consider:\n  - If he keeps going straight down, we can:\n    - Push RIGHT (5,7) then maybe 6,7, or\n    - Drop DOWN from 4,7 to 4,6 to start a vertical barrier.\n  - Aim to form a thick \u201cL\u201d shape in the mid-right (around x=4\u20136, y=4\u20137) that restricts his ability to swing into the open center.\n- Keep at least 2 safe moves in hand at all times, even while we lean toward confronting his head once we have the positional edge.\n\nRIGHT",

New snake:\n  - Head (5,7)  \n  - Body: (4,7),(3,7),(2,7),(2,8),(2,9),(3,9),(4,9),(4,8)  \n- Now neighbors from (5,7) next turn:\n  - LEFT (4,7): our body \u274c  \n  - UP (5,8): was tail, now vacated \u21d2 empty \u2705  \n  - DOWN (5,6): empty \u2705  \n  - RIGHT (6,7): empty \u2705  \n- Again **3 safe exits** (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Excellent flexibility.\n\nSo only **DOWN** and **RIGHT** are legal and safe. No instant death, no body hits, no head-on with enemy this turn (they\u2019re stuck going to (9,7)).\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Which move SQUEEZES this dude harder?\n\nEnemy future after this turn:\n- This turn: (9,8) \u2192 (9,7) forced.\n- Next turn from (9,7), they\u2019ll have:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (8,7) (vacated tail) \u2013 toward center  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (9,6) \u2013 sliding further down the wall  \n- UP and RIGHT are still illegal.  \nSo in 1\u20132 turns, they\u2019re trying to **escape left from the right wall** into the center.\n\nOur job? **Be there first. Choke that route. Force bad choices.** \ud83d\ude08\n\nCompare our options:\n\n**If we go DOWN to (4,6):**\n- We sit more central-low, but we stay at x=4.\n- There\u2019s a bigger horizontal gap between us and his corridor at x=8\u20139.\n- When he swings LEFT at y=7, we\u2019re lower and farther \u2013 less direct pressure.\n- Still safe, but more \u201cgive him room, play it slow\u201d.\n\n**If we go RIGHT to (5,7):**\n- We slide one step closer horizontally toward his escape lane.\n- We maintain a strong presence in the upper-middle (y=7\u20139) where he\u2019ll be.  \n- From 5,7 next turn, we can:\n  - Go RIGHT to 6,7 to move directly toward his future 8,7 line.\n  - Drop DOWN to start a vertical wall near x=5/6 if he tries to go under us.\n  - Go UP into 5,8 to thicken a top \u201cceiling\u201d if needed.\n- We keep **just as many safe outs** as DOWN, but we project more threat toward him.\n\nWe\u2019re **up 8\u20136**. We *want* to lean into aggression and positioning that lets us:\n- Control the center-right,\n- Shadow his head,\n- Eventually threaten a **winning head-on** or a full box when the timing is right.\n\nGiven both options are safe and flexible, the **ruthless** choice is the one that pushes our front line closer to his escape route.\n\nThat\u2019s **RIGHT**. We step into the midline and start building the cage. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd12\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Short-term game plan (note to future self)\n\n- Expect enemy path: (9,8) \u2192 (9,7), then likely **LEFT to (8,7)** to escape, or **DOWN to (9,6)** if they stay on the wall.\n- From (5,7):\n  - If he comes LEFT across row 7, consider mirroring RIGHT (6,7) to close space and set up a future L-shaped wall (x\u22485\u20137, y\u22486\u20138).\n  - If he drops DOWN along the right side, we can:\n    - Step DOWN ourselves to claim the mid-right vertical lane, or  \n    - Step RIGHT first then down, to \u201cwrap\u201d around his path.\n- Always leave at least 2\u20133 safe moves in the tank; don\u2019t hard-box ourselves just to chase.\n- Keep the lead, keep the pressure, and look for that moment where a forced line gives us a **favorable head-on**.\n\nRIGHT",

Love that leverage.\n\n#### Enemy DOWN \u2192 (9,6)\n- Heads: us **(6,7)**, them **(9,6)**.  \n- They\u2019re one row below, sliding down the right wall.  \n- From 6,7 we can:\n  - Drop DOWN to **6,6** to mirror their descent,\n  - Then push RIGHT toward them and cut off access to apples at (9,4),(9,3),\n  - Or stay high and keep a lane to re-box them from above.\nWe stay super flexible while still positioned **toward** them, not away.\n\n---\n\n### If we go UP \u2192 (5,8)\n\n- New head: (5,8); we\u2019re drifting **away** from the main open space and slightly away from them horizontally.\n\nAgainst:\n- Enemy LEFT \u2192 (8,7): we end (5,8) vs (8,7), more distant.  \n- Enemy DOWN \u2192 (9,6): they drop toward the huge open bottom while we climb **up** and slightly left.  \nWe keep 3 exits (UP, LEFT, RIGHT), but we\u2019re not really choking them; we\u2019re just floating.\n\nAggression? Meh. Pressure? Low.  \n\n---\n\n### If we go DOWN \u2192 (5,6)\n\n- New head: (5,6), more central and lower.\n\nAgainst:\n- Enemy LEFT \u2192 (8,7): vertical gap, they\u2019re still high-right.

Pushes our front line **toward** their inevitable escape route (from 9,7 \u2192 8,7 \u2192 \u2026).  \n2. Keeps **three safe follow-ups** no matter what they do next.  \n3. Sets up future turns where:\n   - We can **race them down the right side** if they drop,\n   - Or **clamp them** between our body and the wall if they stay high,\n   - Or deliberately offer a **head-on at equal length but winning score**.\n\nDOWN is good for farming apples, but slightly loosens the immediate noose.  \nUP is the loosest and least punishing.\n\nWe\u2019re the bigger bully right now. We should **tighten the cage**, not drift.\n\nSo we stick to the game plan from last turn and slide **RIGHT** into their lane.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd3 Plan for Future Me (next few turns)\n\n- Watch where #0 goes this turn:\n  - If they go **LEFT to (8,7)**:\n    - From our new head (6,7), keep at least 2 exits (UP & DOWN).\n    - Consider stepping **DOWN** to start a vertical wall (x\u22486) if they try to dive under us.\n    - Only take the risky **RIGHT to 7,7** if we\u2019re comfortable potentially forcing a head-on (remember, we WIN a double KO right now).\n  - If they go **DOWN to (9,6)**:\n    - Likely mirror down to **(6,6)** soon to contest center-right.\n    - Aim to cut them off from the apple chain on the right wall (9,5\u21929,4\u21929,3).\n- Keep growing when it doesn\u2019t cramp our mobility, especially that easy apple at (5,5) if the geometry stays safe.\n- Long-term vision: build a **vertical body wall** from upper-mid downwards, trapping them on a shrinking slice of the right side, then either:\n  - Force them into our body, or  \n  - Force a **head-on** on our terms.\n\nRIGHT",

Illegal.\n- UP \u2192 (6,8): empty now, not our body, not theirs. No apple. Safe this turn.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,6): empty, central, no apple. Safe this turn.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,7): empty, no apple. Safe this turn.\n\nEnemy from (9,6) can only safely go:\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,6)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,5)  \n(UP is into its own body at (9,7), RIGHT is off-board.)\n\nWe checked: our candidate cells (6,8), (6,6), (7,7) are not any enemy head target and not in their future body for either of their moves. So UP, DOWN, RIGHT are all immediately safe.\n\n---\n\n### 2) How do we keep pressure and avoid giving them space?\n\nKey idea: they\u2019re near the right wall with two main escape themes:\n- Slip **toward the center** via x=8,7 (move LEFT), or  \n- Slide **down the right wall** to farm apples at (9,4), (9,3).\n\nWe want to:\n- Stay alive,\n- Keep multiple exits open,\n- Position ourselves to **cut off their escape to the center** and\n- Be close enough to **threaten head-on collisions** later (which they must avoid because we\u2019re ahead 8\u20136).\n\nCompare our options:\n\n#### UP (6,8)\n- Moves us away from the huge open lower half.\n- Leaves all the central and lower-right space to them.\n- Still safe, but reduces our influence on their escape routes.\n- We start drifting toward a more cramped top-left zone with our own body.\n\nUP is too passive.\n\n#### RIGHT (7,7)\n- Extends our horizontal wall on y=7 further right (x=2\u20137).\n- Keeps us above them, close, with good follow-ups (7,8), (7,6), (8,7).\n- If they go LEFT to (8,6), we\u2019re one knight-move away and can start \u201cshadow blocking\u201d their center exit with potential head-on threats.\n\nThis is aggressive and good, but it also keeps us a bit higher while the real action (apples and escape space) is **below**.\n\n#### DOWN (6,6)\n- Drops our head straight into the central open area.\n- We still have 3 good exits from there next turn: LEFT (5,6), DOWN (6,5), RIGHT (7,6).\n- If they go LEFT to (8,6), we end at (6,6) vs (8,6): same row, only one gap, very close.\n  - Next turn, if we go RIGHT \u2192 (7,6), their LEFT to (7,6) would be a head-on; since they\u2019re behind, they\u2019ll avoid that and be forced to stay on columns 8\u20139 (UP or DOWN). That keeps them squeezed against the right side.\n- If they go DOWN to (9,5), we are more central and can start moving toward x=8 to cut off their access to the apple chain on the right wall before they can freely spill into the middle.\n\nDOWN gives us:\n- Central control,\n- Direct influence on both their \u201cgo center\u201d and \u201cgo down the wall\u201d plans,\n- A very flexible platform to build a vertical barrier at x\u22486\u20138 later.\n\nIt also maximizes our safe future space (huge open field below), while keeping us close enough to continue bullying them.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Strategy note for future me\n\n- From (6,6), if they go LEFT to (8,6), strongly consider moving RIGHT to (7,6) next turn to deny them moving left into the center with a safe path; force them to oscillate on columns 8\u20139 where the wall and our body can eventually box them.\n- If they go DOWN to (9,5), prioritize sliding toward x=7\u20138 (e.g., 7,6 \u2192 8,6) rather than immediately chasing apples; we want to stand between them and the central area, turning the right side into a narrow corridor they can\u2019t escape.\n- Keep using our score advantage: whenever a potential head-on square exists and they have few alternatives, remember they must avoid it, so we can treat that square almost like a temporary wall.\n- Only take nearby apples (like the one at (5,5)) when it doesn\u2019t reduce our control over their escape routes.\n\nDOWN",

I\u2019m not chasing apples for the sake of it\u2014I want to keep him pinned in the top right, shrink that real estate, and make sure every move forces him to play defense while I stay alive.\n\nLooking at the options from (8,6): right is blocked by my own neck, left leads straight into the bottle-neck at (7,6) where his head can gladly slam into me and we both die, and up pushes me into a tighter pocket with very limited exits given my tail wrapping around row 9. Down to (8,5) is the only move that keeps multiple escape routes open, lets me drop toward the middle where I can cut across his approach, and keeps me alive to bait him into overextending.\n\nPLAN: Slide downward to (8,5), keep following his downward moves, and use my body to wall-off the left corridor\u2014he\u2019s got to keep circling up there, so I\u2019ll amass control of the center and be ready to pinch him against the western wall while keeping myself out of head-on danger.\n\nDOWN",

Exactly what we planned for.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Check all four moves\n\nFrom our head (6,6):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (6,7)**  \n  That\u2019s our own body (and our neck). Instant death. Throw it out.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,6)**  \n  - Not our body, not theirs. Safe this turn.  \n  - But then enemy can safely go **LEFT to (7,6)** and break out toward the center with no head-on threat. We\u2019d be drifting left while they claim the central lanes.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,5)**  \n  - Empty, safe this turn.  \n  - Big open field below, lots of apples.  \n  - But again, it lets them safely move **LEFT to (7,6)** and step into the center. We\u2019d be underneath while they slip out.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7,6)**  \n  - Cell is empty now, not our body, not theirs. Safe this turn.  \n  - If enemy goes **LEFT \u2192 (7,6)**, it\u2019s a **head-on collision**. With score 8\u20136, we win that double-KO. So LEFT becomes a losing move for them.  \n  - Realistically, they\u2019ll be forced to choose **UP to (8,7)** or **DOWN to (8,5)** instead, staying on column 8 and effectively \u201cwalled\u201d off from the center by our head threatening their left moves.\n\nSo immediate safety: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT are all survivable. UP is illegal. But strategically, LEFT and DOWN both give them a clean, safe breakout lane at (7,6). RIGHT turns that same cell into a losing trap for them.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Board control and boxing plan\n\nOur body already forms a big horizontal wall across y=7 from x=2\u20136. Enemy is clustered on the top/right. The key escape lane for them is **toward the center via x=7**.\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (7,6)**:\n\n- We occupy the central column right under them.\n- Their **LEFT** to (7,6) is now a losing double-KO, so they must avoid it.\n- Next turn from (7,6), our only legal moves will be:\n  - **DOWN \u2192 (7,5)** (apple), or  \n  - **UP \u2192 (7,7)** (empty), since LEFT is backwards and RIGHT will likely be into their body.\n- Wherever they go (UP to 8,7 or DOWN to 8,5), we can keep stepping into the squares they\u2019d like to use to move left (7,7, then 7,5, etc.), always presenting a head-on threat they cannot accept because they\u2019re behind in score.\n\nThat means:\n- We **claim column 7** as a \u201cno-go zone\u201d for them.\n- They get squeezed between our body on the left and the right wall, either in the top-right or drifting down into a narrow corridor.\n- We still have a big open field to our left and below; we\u2019re not getting cramped by this.\n\nIf instead we go **LEFT** or **DOWN**, they just walk into (7,6) for free and start owning the middle of the board. That makes it much harder to ever box them; it hands them the best space.\n\nGiven:\n- We\u2019re ahead on apples, so a double-KO is favorable.\n- RIGHT is safe unless they choose to suicide into us.\n- RIGHT denies them the center and keeps maximum pressure.\n\nWe stick to our previous plan: **step to (7,6) and use our head to \u201cshadow block\u201d their escape.**\n\n---\n\n### Strategy note to future me\n\n- From (7,6), expect them to be at either (8,7) or (8,5).  \n- Keep playing the \u201cthreat square\u201d game:  \n  - If they\u2019re above (8,7), moving **UP to (7,7)** makes their **LEFT to (7,7)** a losing head-on.  \n  - If they\u2019re below (8,5), moving **DOWN to (7,5)** makes their **LEFT to (7,5)** a losing head-on.  \n- Use this to force them to keep to columns 8\u20139 while we gradually extend a vertical presence around x=7 and then drift down to collect apples (like at (7,5)) **only when it doesn\u2019t let them slip past us**.\n- Always remember: with the score lead, any clear double-head collision is good for us; they are the ones who must dodge.\n\nright",

Let\u2019s check all moves.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four directions (instant death or not?)\n\nFrom (7,6):\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,6)**  \n  That\u2019s our **neck**. Moving backwards = auto-INT. \u274c\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,6)**  \n  That\u2019s **enemy body** (not a tail). Even after they move, (8,6) stays body. Suicidal. \u274c\n\n- **UP \u2192 (7,7)**  \n  Currently empty, no enemy can reach it this turn. **Safe** this turn. \u2705\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,5)**  \n  Currently an **apple**. Safe cell **unless** enemy also goes there. \u2705\n\nNow, the fun part: simultaneous moves and head-ons \ud83d\ude0f  \n\nEnemy from (8,5) can move:\n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,5)** (apple)  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9,5)**  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,4)**  \n- **UP \u2192 (8,6)** is **backwards into its own neck (8,6)** \u2192 illegal.\n\nSo only **LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN** are real for them.\n\nIf **we go DOWN to (7,5)** and they go **LEFT to (7,5)**:\n- **Both heads collide** on (7,5) \u2192 **double-KO**.\n- Score at that moment: **us 8, them 6** \u2192 **WE WIN THE GAME**. \ud83c\udfc6\n\nSo DOWN creates a **winning head-on threat**. If they\u2019re rational, LEFT becomes a losing move they must avoid.\n\nIf **we go UP to (7,7)** instead:\n- They are totally free to go **LEFT \u2192 (7,5)**, eat the apple, and escape toward center-bottom.  \n- No collision, just them gaining space and +1 apple. That\u2019s exactly what we do *not* want.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 UP vs DOWN \u2013 who boxes who, chat? \ud83d\ude08\n\n#### If we go **UP \u2192 (7,7)**:\n- Our new head: (7,7), body line across y=7 from x=2\u20137.\n- Enemy can safely go **LEFT \u2192 (7,5)**, eat apple, and start slipping under us into the center.  \n- Next turn we\u2019re kind of stuck with only **UP or RIGHT** options from (7,7), drifting away from them while they gain central control below us.\n- That **loosens the box** and gives them more room and apples. Meh.\n\n#### If we go **DOWN \u2192 (7,5)**:\n- We **eat the apple** \u2192 go to **9 apples** \ud83d\udcaa\n- We turn (7,5) into a **death square** for them (head-on loss if they go LEFT).\n- They\u2019re effectively forced to:\n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (9,5)** (still on right side), or  \n  - **DOWN \u2192 (8,4)** (more bottom-right)  \n\nEither way, they stay **boxed into columns 8\u20139** while:\n- We sit on **column 7** as a **vertical gate**,\n- Our big wall at **y=7, x=2\u20136** continues to cut off the entire left side.\n\nNext turn from (7,5), our safe moves look like:\n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,5)** (open space), or  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,4)** (open, and keeps the \u201cgate\u201d on column 7).\n\nAnd the beauty?  \nIf they go **DOWN to (8,4)** this turn, and we then go **DOWN to (7,4)** next turn, **their LEFT to (7,4)** becomes another **losing head-on**. We just keep **parking our head exactly where they want to go left**. Over and over. That\u2019s textbook boxing with a score lead \ud83d\udca3\n\nSo:\n- **DOWN** is safe now.\n- **DOWN** gives us an apple.\n- **DOWN** preserves and *strengthens* the box.\n- **DOWN** threatens an **instant winning double-KO** if they grief-move LEFT.\n\nWhy let them out into the center when we can choke them out against the right wall, chat? \ud83d\ude0f\n\n---\n\n### Strategy note to future me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- We\u2019re going **DOWN to (7,5)** to both:\n  - Grab the apple (go to 9), and  \n  - Deny their **LEFT to center** by making it a losing head-on.\n- Expect them to choose **RIGHT (9,5)** or **DOWN (8,4)**.\n- From (7,5), strongly consider **staying on column 7 by going DOWN to (7,4)** if it keeps creating \u201cdeath squares\u201d for their left moves. Use our head as a **moving barrier** on x=7 to keep them trapped on x=8\u20139.\n- Only pivot LEFT toward middle/bottom when:\n  - They\u2019re clearly sealed off on the right, or  \n  - A forced head-on in our favor is available.\n- Remember: we win any clean head-on right now. If a line appears where they must move into us or die later, **take the trade**.\n\nDOWN",

Question is: do we tighten the bars, or do we go snack mode and maybe let him sneak out? \ud83e\udd14\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from (7,1)\n\n### \ud83d\udd3a UP \u2192 (7,2)\nDirectly into our own neck.  \nThat\u2019s the instant \u201cwalk backwards into yourself\u201d L.  \n\u27a1\ufe0f **Illegal.**\n\n### \u25b6\ufe0f RIGHT \u2192 (8,1)\nThat\u2019s **enemy body** right now, and it **stays** body no matter where his head moves (since the tail is way up at (9,6)).  \nHead into enemy body = **we die.**  \n\u27a1\ufe0f **Illegal.**\n\n### \u25c0\ufe0f LEFT \u2192 (6,1)\nCell (6,1) = **apple** \ud83c\udf4e + empty of any body. Locally safe this turn.\n\nEnemy from (8,0) has only two real moves (UP is into his own body, DOWN is off-board):\n\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,0)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,0)\n\nNo immediate collision with us if we go to (6,1). So **short-term safe**.\n\nBut look what happens if he goes **LEFT to (7,0)**:\n\n- Board after this turn:\n  - Our head: (6,1) on an apple \u2192 we grow to 11.\n  - Their head: (7,0) right under our vertical wall.\n- Next turn:\n  - From (7,0), his only non-suicidal move is **LEFT to (6,0)** (apple).\n  - From our new head at (6,1), we have **three** safe moves: UP (6,2), LEFT (5,1), DOWN (6,0).\n\nIf we play \u201cnormal safe snake\u201d (UP or LEFT), he **slips under our wall** to (6,0) and starts leaking into the huge open left side. Suddenly the prisoner is out in the yard with us. \ud83d\ude2c\n\nYes, we got an apple, but we\u2019ve blown the integrity of the jail at the bottom. That\u2019s a **big positional concession** just to eat.\n\nIf he instead goes RIGHT to (9,0), he stays boxed, but from his POV, **LEFT to (7,0)** is the route to freedom, so that\u2019s the scary line for us.\n\nSo LEFT = greedy snack + more options next turn, but **risk of letting him escape under the wall.**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd3b DOWN \u2192 (7,0)\nCell (7,0) is currently **empty**. So locally safe.\n\nEnemy at (8,0) can go:\n\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,0)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,0)\n\nIf he goes **LEFT to (7,0)** while we go **DOWN to (7,0)**:\n- Double head-on in the same cell.\n- Both die.\n- Score at that instant: **we have 10, they have 7** \u2192 we win the game on apples.  \nSo even in the worst collision, we\u2019re **favored**. But an actually smart opponent doesn\u2019t want to immediately lose, so what do they do?\n\nThey go **RIGHT to (9,0)**:\n\n- After moves:\n  - Our head: **(7,0)**.\n  - Their head: **(9,0)**.\n- Our body now forms a solid vertical wall at **x = 7 from y = 0 all the way up to y = 6**, plus the horizontal roof at y=7 from x=3\u20136.\n- He\u2019s squeezed in the rectangle on the **right side**: basically columns 8\u20139 under our wall.\n\nNext turn from (7,0):\n\n- Legal moves:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (6,0) \ud83c\udf4e\n  - UP \u2192 (7,1) (backwards, illegal)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (8,0) (enemy body, suicide)\n  - DOWN \u2192 off-board\n- So we\u2019re **forced LEFT to (6,0)** next turn, but:\n  - That\u2019s an apple.\n  - It pulls us back out of the corner.\n  - Our vertical wall at x=7 from y=0\u20136 **stays intact**.\n\nMeanwhile, from his new head (9,0):\n\n- Only safe move is **UP to (9,1)** (LEFT is his body, RIGHT/DOWN are off-board).\n- So his next move is basically forced too: he climbs the right edge while we farm the bottom-left and keep the iron curtain at x=7.\n\nSo DOWN:\n\n- Keeps him **completely boxed on the right bottom** for now.\n- Maintains a **winning head-on threat**: if he ever tries to punch through our wall horizontally, he risks a losing collision.\n- Sets up a guaranteed apple for us next turn at (6,0) **without** giving him an underpass.\n\nYes, we have only one safe move next turn from (7,0), but it\u2019s forced **and good**, and the positional payoff is huge.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Comparing LEFT vs DOWN\n\n- **LEFT to (6,1)**:\n  - +1 apple immediately.\n  - More local options next turn.\n  - BUT opens the critical tactic where he can go (8,0) \u2192 (7,0) \u2192 (6,0) and escape into the left.\n  - That undermines our whole jail strategy.\n\n- **DOWN to (7,0)**:\n  - No apple this turn, but:\n  - Threat of winning head-on if he griefs.\n  - Realistically forces him to go RIGHT to (9,0), keeping him trapped.\n  - Next turn we grab (6,0) apple anyway.\n  - Our wall at x=7 becomes a full-height barrier from y=0\u20136, reinforcing our control of the map.\n\nWe\u2019re up **10\u20137**, we\u2019re the bigger snake, and our win condition is **domination + box-in**, not just random snacks. Why open the door and let him into the big open left when we can slam it **shut** at the bottom and keep him suffering on the right? \ud83d\ude0f\n\nWe\u2019ll take the \u201ciron curtain\u201d line and keep him caged.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcdc Plan for future me (next few turns)\n\n- **This turn:** Go **DOWN to (7,0)** to extend our vertical wall all the way to the bottom edge and keep the underpass closed.\n- **Expect:** He goes **RIGHT to (9,0)** to avoid an immediate losing head-on.\n- **Next turn (from 7,0):** Take the **forced LEFT to (6,0)** for a safe apple and step out of the corner; wall at x=7 from y=0\u20136 stays solid.\n- After that:\n  - Likely he climbs up the right side (9,0 \u2192 9,1 \u2192 9,2 \u2192 \u2026).  \n  - We keep expanding on the left/bottom, maybe chain (6,0) \u2192 (6,1) \u2192 (5,1), growing while our wall blocks direct contact.\n  - Watch for chances to force **future head-ons in our favor** if he ever tries to cross the line at x=7 or come over the top.\n\nDOWN",

Time to box him and run the table! \ud83d\udca5\ud83e\udde0\n\nUP",

Does it clear?  \n- Enemy from (9,0) cannot go LEFT (8,0), that\u2019s backwards into his own neck.  \n- He cannot go RIGHT (10,0) or DOWN (9,-1), off-board.  \n- His only legal move is UP to (9,1), and when he does, (8,0) remains body (tail comes off (8,6)).  \nSo (8,0) stays his body; we\u2019d slam our head directly into him.  \n\u21d2 Suicide. Illegal.\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (6,0)**  \n- Currently an apple.\n- Not our body.\n- Not enemy body.\n- Enemy\u2019s only move is UP to (9,1), so no chance of a same-cell collision.\n\nSo this turn, LEFT is the **only** move that keeps us alive.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 What does LEFT set up?\n\nAfter this turn if we go LEFT and he goes UP:\n\n- Our new head: (6,0) on an apple \u2192 we grow to 11 apples, length increases.\n- Our old head (7,0) becomes body, reinforcing the wall at x=7 from y=0\u20136.\n- Enemy head: (9,1), forced toward the top along the right edge.\n\nNext turn from (6,0) we\u2019ll have:\n\n- UP \u2192 (6,1) (apple and open)\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,0) (open)\n- DOWN \u2192 off-board\n- RIGHT \u2192 back into (7,0) (our own body, illegal)\n\nSo we\u2019ll still have **two** safe options and a fat vertical wall between us and him. Meanwhile he\u2019s forced to keep climbing on the right (9,1 \u2192 9,2 \u2192 9,3 \u2026), staying trapped behind our line.\n\nWe keep him boxed, we get even longer, and we keep the option to someday force a head-on in our favor when the timing is right.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Mini-plan for future me\n\n- Grow off this bottom apple while keeping the x=7 wall solid.\n- Let him crawl up the right edge; we mirror by expanding on the left/bottom/mid rows.\n- Watch the top-right: if he ever tries to slip over the top of our wall, we look for a head-on where we\u2019re still ahead on apples.\n- Priority: maintain the cage, keep ourselves with at least two safe outs, and use our length advantage to bully space.\n\nOnly one correct move this turn, and it\u2019s clean.\n\nLEFT",

He\u2019s forced.\n\nWe\u2019re up **12\u20137** on apples. We\u2019re the boss here \ud83d\ude0e\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check ALL four moves from (6,1)\n\nNeighbors:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (6,2)**\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,0)**\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,1)**\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7,1)**\n\nNow filter for insta-death:\n\n#### DOWN \u2192 (6,0) \u274c\n- That\u2019s our own neck segment (second segment in our body).\n- Moving directly backward into your neck = auto-death.\n- \ud83d\udeab Illegal.\n\n#### RIGHT \u2192 (7,1) \u274c\n- That\u2019s a solid block of our own body, not the tail.\n- It will still be occupied when we move.\n- Running into it = self-KO.\n- \ud83d\udeab Illegal.\n\nSo we\u2019re down to:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (6,2)** \u2705\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,1)** \u2705\n\nNow check enemy collision risk:\n\n- Enemy from (9,2) can only go to (9,3).  \n- Neither **(6,2)** nor **(5,1)** are reachable by him this turn.  \n- No head-on, no surprise body hit.

Toss it.\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,1) on-board, empty \u2192 safe this turn.\n- UP \u2192 (4,2) on-board, apple, no snake there \u2192 safe this turn.\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,0) on-board, apple, no snake there \u2192 safe this turn.\n\nEnemy from (9,4):\n- UP \u2192 (9,5) (only safe move, board is empty there)\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,4) (own body)\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,3) (own body/backwards)\n- RIGHT \u2192 off-board  \nSo he is forced UP to (9,5). None of our candidate squares overlap or even come close, so no head-on risk this turn.\n\nSafe options for us: LEFT, UP, DOWN.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Compare our three safe moves\n\nWe care about:\n- Not dying this or next turn\n- Keeping multiple safe follow-ups\n- Staying in open space while we farm apples\n- Maintaining/strengthening the box on the enemy\n\n#### Option A: DOWN \u2192 (4,0) (apple, grow)\n\nNew head: (4,0), body extends, tail does NOT move.\n\nNext turn from (4,0):\n- UP \u2192 (4,1) = backwards into neck \u2192 illegal\n- DOWN \u2192 off-board \u2192 illegal\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,0) (empty, safe)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,0) (empty, safe)\n\nSo if we go DOWN, we\u2019re immediately on the bottom wall with **only 2 legal moves (LEFT, RIGHT)** next turn. That\u2019s a low-flex position in a corner-ish area; not ideal when we already have a healthy lead and lots of open field above.\n\n#### Option B: LEFT \u2192 (3,1) (no apple)\n\nWe don\u2019t grow, so tail moves.\n\nNew body (tail at (5,7) leaves):\n- Head at (3,1), then (4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,0),(7,0),(7,1),(7,2),(7,3),(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7)\n\nNext turn from (3,1):\n- UP \u2192 (3,2) (empty)\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,0) (empty)\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,1) (empty)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,1) = backwards into neck \u2192 illegal\n\nSo we keep **3 safe options**. Left side stays very open, and we can still move toward the apple cluster soon. This is solid positionally, but we\u2019re passing on a free apple with no compensation this turn.\n\n#### Option C: UP \u2192 (4,2) (apple, grow)\n\nNew head: (4,2), we grow, tail at (5,7) does NOT move.\n\nNew body:\n- (4,2),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,0),(7,0),(7,1),(7,2),(7,3),(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7),(5,7)\n\nNext turn from (4,2):\n- UP \u2192 (4,3) (empty)\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,2) (empty)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,2) (empty)\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,1) = backwards into neck \u2192 illegal\n\nSo with UP we also keep **3 safe follow-up moves**, and we:\n- Gain an apple (pushing our lead from 13\u20139 to 14\u20139)\n- Move slightly more central and upward, which helps us race to the top lanes sooner\n- Stay away from the cramped bottom edge\n\nCompared:\n- DOWN is worst: fewer follow-up options, stuck on the bottom.\n- LEFT and UP both preserve 3 outs; UP also gives an apple and better vertical progress.\n\nGiven our instructions to grow aggressively and maintain options, **UP is strictly better than LEFT here**.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Enemy implications\n\nEnemy is forced to (9,5), then likely:\n- To (9,6) or (8,5) next.\nThey are still confined to the right half; our x=7 wall from y=0\u20136 plus our bulk at (5,7),(6,7) keeps them boxed for now. By going UP:\n- We move toward the central/top lanes where we can later sweep across and threaten a full enclosure or a winning head-on if they try to escape.\n\nWe keep the initiative and our score lead, with zero collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n### Mini-plan for Future Me\n\n- From (4,2), keep working generally UP and LEFT through the open center-left, grabbing apples while staying well away from our own wall on the right side.\n- Watch the enemy\u2019s climb on the right edge; as they approach the top, look to swing our head toward the upper lanes to either seal them off or line up a favorable head-on.\n- Always preserve at least 2\u20133 safe options around the head; don\u2019t hug the bottom or left borders too tightly unless it directly contributes to the box.\n\nUP",

This pushes us a bit toward the open left and the apple cluster there, and farther from the enemy.\n\n#### Option C: RIGHT \u2192 (5,2)\n\nNew snake:\n- Head: (5,2)\n- Body: (4,2),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,0),(7,0),(7,1),(7,2),(7,3),(7,4),(7,5),(7,6),(6,6),(6,7)\n\nNext turn from (5,2), backwards is (4,2):\n- UP    \u2192 (5,3) (empty)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,2) (empty)\n- DOWN  \u2192 (5,1) (our body, collision = death)\n- LEFT  \u2192 (4,2) (backwards, illegal)\n\nSo after RIGHT we only have 2 safe options (UP, RIGHT), and we\u2019re drifting back toward our own crowded right-side wall.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Strategic positioning vs enemy\n\nBig picture:\n- Our body already forms a serious barrier on the right: column x=7 from y=0\u20136 plus segments at (6,6),(6,7).\n- Enemy is squeezed on x=8\u20139 below y\u22486.\n- They will eventually try to climb up around the top of our wall (via 9,6\u21929,7\u21928,7\u21927,7, etc.).\n\nWe want:\n- Our head in the central/top lanes so we can react when they pop out.\n- To avoid drifting back toward our own mass where self-traps are more likely.\n- To maintain multiple outs for future turns and keep pressure, leveraging our 14\u20139 lead for a future favorable head-on if needed.\n\nComparing the three:\n- RIGHT reduces our future options and pulls us toward our own dense territory: worst strategically.\n- LEFT and UP both keep 3 outs. LEFT moves us further away from the enemy; UP keeps us more central and vertically advanced to contest the top lanes and threaten them when they try to escape.\n\nGiven we want to dominate the central/top area and stay in position to punish their breakout from the right box, UP is the best balance of safety, flexibility, and long-term aggression.\n\n---\n\n### Mini-plan to Future Me\n\n- From (4,3), keep playing in the central lanes (x\u22483\u20135, y going upward).\n- Let our long right wall continue to constrain the enemy; watch for them climbing to y\u22656 on columns 8\u20139.\n- As they approach the top (9,6/9,7/8,7), look to swing our head upward and slightly right to either:\n  - seal them off into a narrow upper-right corridor, or\n  - line up a favorable head-on, remembering we win any double KO thanks to our apple lead.\n- Avoid stepping too close to our own vertical wall at x=7 unless we clearly see a clean escape path and a tactical gain.\n\nUP",

Meh.\n- UP: central + upward, 1-step from that (5,4) apple. Solid, keeps pressure.\n- RIGHT: gets us right under the apple cluster (5,4 then 5,5,6,5,6,3), grows us **fast**, and moves us slightly closer to the enemy side so our wall and our head can coordinate to seal his escape later.\n\nCan RIGHT over-crowd us? Not really right now:\n- Center (x=3\u20136, y\u22653) is wide open.\n- After RIGHT, we still have 3 escape moves and a clean path to grow while maintaining our existing right wall.\n- More length = more board control = more ways for him to die by touching us.\n\nRIGHT aggressively sets up:\n- Next turns: snag apples at (5,4) then maybe (5,5)/(6,3)/(6,5).\n- Our tail stops shrinking whenever we eat, keeping that nasty x=7 wall intact longer.\n- We grow the lead and can later climb up toward the top to intercept his breakout with a **favorable** head-on if we want.\n\nSo among safe moves, **RIGHT** gives:\n- Great future flexibility,\n- Immediate high-value apples,\n- Stronger long-term box on the enemy side,\n- And keeps us positioned for aggression, not running.\n\nWe take it. \ud83d\ude0e\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd3 Mini-plan to future me (next few turns)\n\n- From (5,3), prioritize grabbing the safe central apples: (5,4), then likely (5,5) / (6,3) / (6,5), as long as we don\u2019t drift too deep into our own wall.\n- Use growth to keep that x=7 wall thick while we shift our head slightly **up and right** toward mid-top (around x=5\u20136, y=6\u20138).\n- Watch enemy: if he starts climbing to (8,6) / (8,7) / (8,8), prep to mirror upward so we can challenge his crossing near the top row.\n- If a clean head-on presents itself in a corridor where he has no dodge (and we still have apple lead), **take it** \u2013 double KO is our win condition.\n\nRIGHT",

Let\u2019s look at what\u2019s possible: DOWN is blocked by my own body at (8,5), LEFT is jammed into their spine at (7,6) and would be instant death, so that leaves UP and RIGHT. RIGHT punts me into (9,6) which tunnels me against the wall and forces a predictable follow-up (only UP after that), but if I go UP now to (8,7) I keep both the high corridor and a potential swoop into (9,7) open, still hugging the flank without slamming into the corner. Do I want to make a snap play when I\u2019m down on apples? Nah, I want to keep options open, bait him into the center, and then slam the collapse.\n\nPlan: Stay in the upper-right corridor, circle row 7/8, and once the tail at (7,6) loosens up I can pivot through (9,6)/(9,7) to squeeze him toward the middle while keeping my exit routes wide. \n\nUP",

Next turn neighbors:\n- UP \u2192 (5,3) = neck \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,2) = our body \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,2) empty \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,1) = our body \u274c  \n\nSo we\u2019d have **only one safe move**, RIGHT to (6,2).  \nFrom **(6,2)** next turn:\n- UP \u2192 (6,3) empty \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,2) = neck \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,2) body \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,1) body \u274c  \n\nThat\u2019s a tight tunnel under our own horizontal body. Super easy to self-trap a few turns later. With our lead and control, we **do not** need to drop into a cramped pocket.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 DOWN is technically safe now but strategically trash. Pass \u274c\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 RIGHT \u2192 (6,3) (APPLE)\n\nWe eat the apple at (6,3) \ud83c\udf4e \u2192 tail at (6,6) **does not move**, keeping our right wall thick.\n\nNew structure:\n- Head: (6,3)\n- Body chain: 5,3 \u2192 4,3 \u2192 4,2 \u2192 4,1 \u2192 5,1 \u2192 6,1 \u2192 6,0 \u2192 7,0 \u2192 7,1 \u2192 7,2 \u2192 7,3 \u2192 7,4 \u2192 7,5 \u2192 7,6 \u2192 6,6\n\nFrom new head **(6,3)**:\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,3) = neck \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,3) = our body \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,2) empty \u2705 but leads into that same low tunnel  \n- UP \u2192 (6,4) empty \u2705 and opens to apples\n\nSo we\u2019d have **2 safe options** (UP, DOWN), but one of them (DOWN) is again that sketchy tunnel between y=1 and y=3 where we can get boxed by our own body.\n\nBest follow-up after RIGHT is clearly **UP to (6,4)** and then farming the apples at **(6,5)** and **(5,5)**. That\u2019s playable and aggressive, but it keeps us hugging our own wall and reduces flexibility a bit.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 UP \u2192 (5,4) (APPLE)\n\nWe eat the apple at (5,4) \ud83c\udf4e \u2192 tail at (6,6) **stays**, right wall intact.\n\nNew head: **(5,4)**. Body becomes:\n- 5,4 (head)\n- 5,3 \u2192 4,3 \u2192 4,2 \u2192 4,1 \u2192 5,1 \u2192 6,1 \u2192 6,0 \u2192 7,0 \u2192 7,1 \u2192 7,2 \u2192 7,3 \u2192 7,4 \u2192 7,5 \u2192 7,6 \u2192 6,6\n\nFrom head **(5,4)** next turn:\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,3) = neck \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,4) empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,4) empty \u2705  \n- UP \u2192 (5,5) = apple \u2705  \n\nSo with UP we keep **3 strong options** and a direct line into that central apple cluster:  \n- (5,5) \ud83c\udf4e  \n- (6,5) \ud83c\udf4e  \n- plus future access to top-center (5,6),(5,7),(4,8),(8,8) zones.\n\nPositionally:\n- We stay **central**, not glued to our own wall.\n- We\u2019re moving **up toward where the enemy will eventually try to escape** (around y=7\u20139).\n- We keep huge flexibility to swing left or right to cut off his crossing later.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 How does this pressure the enemy?\n\nEnemy likely plan from (8,6):\n- UP \u2192 (8,7)\n- then UP \u2192 (8,8) (apple)\n- then maybe (8,9) \u2192 (7,9) to finally break left across the top.\n\nOur goals:\n- Keep that **x=7 wall** from y=0\u20136 plus (6,6) intact as long as possible.\n- Grow even **longer** so any path he uses to cross is lined with our body.\n- Climb **up and toward center/top** so when he finally reaches row 8\u20139, he sees us waiting like a brick wall \ud83d\ude08\n- If a future 1-wide corridor gives us a **head-on** with our length/score lead? We **take** that double-KO.\n\nBetween UP and RIGHT:\n- Both eat an apple and keep the wall.\n- RIGHT keeps us lower and closer to our own structure, with fewer flexible exits.\n- UP gives us **more outs**, closer approach to mid/top lanes, and better overall board control.\n\nWe\u2019re not hiding, we\u2019re **claiming the high ground** and farming safely at the same time. That\u2019s how you choke someone out in Snake.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcd3 Mini-plan to future me\n\n- From **(5,4)**, prioritize going **UP to (5,5)** if it\u2019s safe, then consider (6,5) to stack more apples and keep our tail anchored on the right wall.\n- Drift our head gradually **upward and slightly right** (x=5\u20136, y=5\u20138) so we\u2019re in position to contest the enemy\u2019s breakout near the top.\n- Avoid dropping back down into the tunnel around y=2; we don\u2019t need that low space and it\u2019s easy to self-box.\n- Track enemy head: if he commits to a narrow passage while shorter than us, be ready to steer into a **forced head-on** or leave him only options that walk into our body.\n\nUP",

LEFT into (7,9) stays on the high ground, keeps both the north/south doors open, and edges me toward his flank so I can swing down next turn with flexible exits. That\u2019s the plan: keep skating west across row 9, then drop down around column 6 to pinch him into my spine and hope he runs into me trying to escape. \ud83d\udc80\ud83c\udf00\n\nPlan for the next few moves: keep sliding left atop row 9 to pull his head that direction, then peel downward when he commits to the east chokes so my belly becomes the cage.

Time to choke this dude out, not throw the lead.\n\nCurrent heads:  \n- **Us:** (5,6)  \n- **Enemy:** (8,9) \u2014 stuck in the top-right corner, only way out is sideways.\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves\n\nFrom our head **(5,6)**:\n\n### \ud83d\udd3d DOWN \u2192 (5,5)\nThat\u2019s literally our neck segment.  \nMove backwards into ourselves = instant self-implosion \u2620\ufe0f  \n\u27a1\ufe0f **ILLEGAL**\n\n---\n\n### \u25b6\ufe0f RIGHT \u2192 (6,6)\n- In-bounds, currently empty \u2705  \n- Not our body, not theirs \u2705  \n- No apple there, so we\u2019d move tail off **(7,6)** and keep the x=7 wall from y=0\u21925.\n\nAfter move, we\u2019d be at **(6,6)** with 3 good options next turn: UP to (6,7), DOWN to (6,5) (apple), RIGHT to (7,6) (just freed).  \nSo it\u2019s **safe** and keeps options.\n\nBut\u2026 notice the tradeoff: going RIGHT doesn\u2019t raise us toward the top band; it burns a move just to shift sideways. Enemy is already at **y=9**. Do we really want to waste a tempo while he starts wriggling out toward the center? \ud83e\udd28\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **Safe but slows our vertical race to the top**\n\n---\n\n### \u25c0\ufe0f LEFT \u2192 (4,6)\n- In-bounds, empty \u2705  \n- No snake body there \u2705  \n\nNice thing: from **(4,6)** next turn we\u2019d have all 4 options open (UP/LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN) \u2014 tons of freedom.\n\nBut where does that point our pressure? **Away** from the enemy.  \nHe\u2019s up at x=7\u20139, y=9. Sliding left makes it easier for him to drop down through (7,8)/(7,7)/(6,8)\u2026 into the middle while we\u2019re off to the side farming apples. That\u2019s not the villain arc we\u2019re going for \ud83d\ude0f\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **Very safe, very flexible, but relieves pressure on his only escape lane**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd3c UP \u2192 (5,7)\n- In-bounds, currently empty \u2705  \n- Not our body, not their body \u2705  \n- Enemy from (8,9) can only go to (7,9) or (9,9), so **no head-on risk** here \u2705  \n- No apple, so tail slides from **(7,6)** to **(7,5)** and our right wall stays solid from y=0\u21925.\n\nAfter UP, our local options next turn from **(5,7)**:\n- UP \u2192 (5,8) \u2705 (clear, central, closer to top)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,7) \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,7) \u2705  \n\nThat\u2019s **3 clean outs**, and we climb directly into the band where he MUST pass if he ever wants central space. Why let him escape when we can meet him up there and start building a ceiling over his head? \ud83d\ude08\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **Safe, keeps good mobility, and maximizes vertical tempo toward the choke point**\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare the safe lines\n\nWhat\u2019s the mission right now, chat? Box him in the top-right and squeeze until he either:\n- slams his head into our body \ud83d\udc80, or  \n- we force a **head-on trade** (we win 16\u201310 if we both die).\n\nTo do that, we need **height ASAP**, not sideways fluff:\n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 safer, but drifts us away; gives him more air to snake into the middle.\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 nudges us closer horizontally, but burns an entire turn without gaining height; we reach row 8 **one turn later** than just going UP.\n- **UP** \u2192 reaches row 8 in **two** moves (5,6 \u2192 5,7 \u2192 5,8) and keeps us central so we can swing left OR right depending on where he runs.\n\nWe\u2019re the bigger snake. We don\u2019t need to rush apples; we need to **own the top band** and turn the whole right side into a prison.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 So we take the **fastest vertical climb with solid outs**: **UP**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcdc Mini game plan for future me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- Keep pushing **UP into y=8/9** fast; we want to be in the top-center strip (x\u22484\u20136) as he starts moving left from (8,9).  \n- From there, look to lay down a **horizontal body wall** across the top, tying into our right-side column at x=7 \u2014 classic box trap.  \n- Always maintain at least **2 safe exits** each turn; don\u2019t tuck too tight against our own x=7 wall unless we\u2019re sure we\u2019re not self-boxing.  \n- If we ever see a line where his only legal move is a **head-on into us**, TAKE IT \u2014 double KO and we win the tiebreak on apples.  \n\nUP",

For now, we keep skating left, keep the pressure, and let him walk into a trap where he either hits me or gets boxed in by my wall.\n\nPlan for the next few turns: keep moving left along the top row, then peel down when his head drifts too far east so my body forms the cage; force him into a head-on with our tail if he slips.\n\nLEFT",

That gives Snake #0 more room to slither out of the top-right and into the center. We don\u2019t want to relieve that pressure.\n\n3) UP \u2192 (5,8)  \n- Safe: empty cell.  \n- Enemy head at (7,9) can only go to (7,8) or (6,9), so no same-cell head-on with us at (5,8).  \n- After move, we keep 3 strong outs (UP 5,9; LEFT 4,8; RIGHT 6,8).  \n- This is good for taking top-center, but it leaves the x6 column more open for them to escape downward/left.\n\n4) RIGHT \u2192 (6,7)  \n- Safe: empty cell, not occupied by any body, and not a cell the enemy can move into this turn (they can only go to (7,8) or (6,9)).  \n- After move, we keep 3 outs (UP 6,8; RIGHT 7,7; DOWN 6,6).  \n- Critically, this plants us directly under one of their main escape channels (the x6 column):\n  - If they go LEFT to (6,9), we\u2019re at (6,7) with (6,8) between us; we\u2019re sitting right on the path they\u2019d use to drop into the center.\n  - If they go DOWN to (7,8), we\u2019re diagonally below-left at (6,7), able to contest both 6,8 and 7,7 on the following turn.  \n- This keeps maximum pressure on their exit routes while still giving us plenty of room to pivot or retreat into the open left side if needed.\n\nGiven we\u2019re ahead 16\u201310 and want to box them in and threaten future head-on lines, stepping RIGHT to sit directly beneath their likely escape line is the most aggressive and controlling choice that still keeps us very safe.\n\nLong-term note to future me:\n- Use this move to shadow Snake #0\u2019s descent from the top-right: mirror them under x6/x7 and keep yourself between them and the open left side of the board.\n- Aim to turn our long body into a \u201chook\u201d: right wall at x7 (y0\u20134) plus a rising structure around x5\u20136. Gradually close a U-shape around their head.\n- Whenever a future position offers them only a risky head-on vs. crashing into our body, be willing to take the double KO; we win on apples.\n\nRIGHT",

No direct head-on with (7,7) this turn.  \n- If they go DOWN to (6,8), next turn we\u2019re at (7,7) with only UP (7,8) or DOWN (7,6); they can step sideways (5,8 or 7,8), and it\u2019s pretty easy for them to pivot away to the left while we\u2019re sitting to their right.  \n- This keeps us close, but positioned *east* of them, not really blocking their escape lane toward the open left.\n\nDecent pressure, but not the best choke.\n\n**UP \u2192 (6,8)**  \n- (6,8) is empty.  \n- Enemy moves from (6,9):\n  - **DOWN \u2192 (6,8)** \u2192 they go right into us: double-head-on in the same cell. Both die, but we\u2019re **ahead 16\u201310**, so we win the game on the spot.  \n  - **LEFT \u2192 (5,9)** \u2192 they dodge the kill, but now:\n    - We\u2019re at (6,8), directly under and to the right of them.  \n    - They\u2019re forced toward the top-left (4,9 \u2192 4,8, etc.) if they want to escape.  \n    - On the next turns we can slide **LEFT to 5,8, then 4,8**, continually staying under them and offering repeated forks:  \n      - either they step down into our column for a head-on,  \n      - or they are forced to skim the wall and risk crashing into our long central body.\n\nUP does exactly what we want:\n- If they greedily drop center: immediate winning double KO.  \n- If they play safe and go LEFT: we stay **between them and the big open left side**, tightening the box from below while keeping at least two live outs each turn.\n\nGiven our lead and the goal to box and threaten head-on trades, **UP is the most aggressive, winning line that still keeps our future options open.**\n\n---\n\n**Plan to future me (next few turns):**  \nIf they dodge with LEFT to (5,9), use (5,8) and (4,8) as stepping stones.

Keep them in a cage of bad choices.\n\nLEFT",

Perfectly acceptable \u201cdeath\u201d for us.\n\n**b) Enemy LEFT \u2192 (1,9)**  \n- Our head: (2,8) (we eat an apple, go to 18).\n- Their head: (1,9).\n- No collisions; everyone lives.\n\nResulting shape:\n- Our head (2,8) directly under their horizontal line, with:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (1,8) apple.\n  - DOWN \u2192 (2,7) apple.\n- Their head (1,9) can only:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (0,9) (safe),\n  - DOWN \u2192 (1,8) (apple, but then we can threaten more head-on trades).\n\nCritically:\n- We stay right under/near them on the upper left of the board.\n- We gain another segment (apple at 2,8).\n- We continue to threaten losing head-ons for them around (1,8) next turn.\n- There is **no** line where we die alone this turn by going LEFT: the only collision case is the double KO, which we win on apples.\n\nSo LEFT:\n- Never loses outright this turn.\n- Either wins immediately (double KO) or strengthens our board control and length.\n\n---\n\n### 4) If we go DOWN \u2192 (3,7)\n\nEnemy cases:\n\n**a) Enemy DOWN \u2192 (2,8)**  \n- Our head: (3,7).\n- Their head: (2,8) (they eat that apple, go to 11).\n- No collision.\n\n**b) Enemy LEFT \u2192 (1,9)**  \n- Our head: (3,7).\n- Their head: (1,9).\n- No collision.\n\nWe\u2019re safe, and we do keep more open follow-up squares from (3,7). But:\n- We drop farther away from their head.\n- We give them more vertical room on the left side to eventually slip past us into the main board.\n- We reduce immediate pressure and delay any box-in on the top row.\n\nDOWN is \u201csafe and flexible,\u201d but strategically it lets them breathe. We are the bully here; we don\u2019t need to give them space.\n\n---\n\n### 5) Strategy alignment\n\nWhat do we want given the rules and score?\n\n- We\u2019re ahead 17\u201310.  \n- Head-on double KOs where we tie in timing **favor us** by apples.\n- Instructions: \u201cTry to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\u201d That\u2019s literally what LEFT does here.\n- LEFT:\n  - Guarantees we do **not** lose this turn.\n  - Offers an immediate winning trade if they ever step down.\n  - Grows us and tightens the top-left box-in if they dodge.\n\nDOWN:\n- Also safe,\n- But less pressure and gives them more options to escape.\n\nWe\u2019re here to dominate, not drift. So we take the aggressive, winning line.\n\n---\n\n### PLAN FOR FUTURE ME (NEXT FEW TURNS)\n\n- From (2,8), keep hugging just under or near the enemy head along the top-left.\n- Prioritize moves that:\n  - Either create or maintain potential head-on trades (especially around (1,8) and (0,8)/(1,7) as they slide).\n  - Keep at least two safe outs so we don\u2019t accidentally corner ourselves while boxing them in.\n- If they ever have to choose between:\n  - Dropping into a head-on with us, or\n  - Running themselves out of space near the top-left wall,\n  keep them squeezed so every \u201cescape\u201d is worse than a losing trade.\n\nLEFT",

DOWN lets them breathe. We\u2019re not here to let them breathe.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd2e Plan for Future Me (Next Few Turns)\n\nAssuming we go **LEFT to (1,8)**:\n\n1. If they **also go DOWN to (1,8)**:  \n   - Double KO, we win instantly. GG, spam W in chat.\n\n2. If they go **LEFT to (0,9)**:\n   - Next turn, strongly consider **LEFT to (0,8)** to force the double KO when they are effectively forced to go DOWN from (0,9).  \n   - If for any reason the board changes and that\u2019s not clean, you still:\n     - Stay near their head,\n     - Keep them pinned on the top/left walls,\n     - Use your huge body (center column at x=5) as a \u201cback wall\u201d to slowly shrink their safe space.\n\nOverall: stay glued to their head on that top-left corner, always offering a **trade they lose** while making sure we keep at least 2 safe outs for ourselves.\n\nLEFT",

Game over, we win.\n\nWhat if they don\u2019t go DOWN?\n\n- Any of **UP / RIGHT / LEFT**:\n  - They die by wall or own body.\n  - We move safely to (0,8), no collision.\n  - All opponents dead while we\u2019re alive \u21d2 we win instantly.\n\nSo **for every possible enemy move**, our move **LEFT never kills us alone** and always wins the game this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 4) If we go DOWN \u2192 (1,7)\n\nEnemy forced **DOWN \u2192 (0,8)**:\n\n- Our new head: **(1,7)** (empty).\n- Their new head: **(0,8)** (empty).\n- No collisions, both survive, scores stay **19\u201310**.\n\nBoard position:\n- We\u2019ve backed off one row.\n- They\u2019ve escaped the absolute corner and now sit just below it at (0,8).\n- Game continues; we\u2019re still heavily favored, but we pass up a guaranteed win to keep playing.\n\nGiven the rules and our role:\n> \u201cTry to force a head-on collision if you have a higher score.\u201d\n\nDOWN is safe but unnecessarily soft.  \nLEFT is a **forced winning trade right now.**\n\n---\n\n### 5) Strategy note (for hypothetical future turns)\n\nThis move should end the game immediately in our favor via double KO or solo survival.  \nIf for some bizarre reason the rules behaved differently and the game continued with us alive and them dead, the plan would be simple: use our huge central body wall to control space, take safe apples only when they don\u2019t compromise escape routes, and never squeeze ourselves into the corners we just used to trap them.\n\nBut in the real ruleset we\u2019ve got, **LEFT is checkmate**.\n\nLEFT",
