From our head at (1,7):\n  - Moving LEFT to (0,7) reduces the distance to (0,9) to 2 (instead of 3 from a direct UP move toward (0,9)).\n  - Moving UP to (1,8) also results in a distance of 2 to (0,9), but LEFT places us directly on a column that lines up with that apple, potentially making the next two moves toward it more straightforward (UP to (0,8), then UP to (0,9)).\n- Future options: From (0,7) we still have safe paths and can adapt if the enemy changes plans. The path to (0,9) via LEFT then UP twice is clear and safe.\n\nPlan:\n- Primary goal is to reach the apple at (0,9) efficiently while maintaining multiple escape options. Moving LEFT now puts us on a direct route to that apple with minimal risk and keeps future moves flexible.
