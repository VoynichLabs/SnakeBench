It distances me from my tail (which is starting to clear out from the top right) and positions me to intercept the apples at (4, 2) and (2, 3) before Snake #0 can reach them, or to pivot down if needed.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will move towards the center (x=4, x=5) to maintain board control.

My tail (9, 9) is moving away from the top right, so I will eventually have more space there, but right now the bottom is much clearer.\n- Snake #0's head is far to the left.

This cell is occupied by my own body segment (it was (5, 5) last turn, but shifted to (5, 4) if I didn't grow? No, wait. Looking at body: (5, 5) is part of the body. My body segments are (5,2), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). (5,4) is currently empty. So UP is **SAFE**.\n- **DOWN**: (5, 2). **DEATH**. This is my neck/body.\n- **LEFT**: (4, 3). **DEATH**. This is my body.\n- **RIGHT**: (6, 3). **SAFE**. Moves into open space on the right.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- I am currently slightly tangled. My body forms a \"C\" shape around (5,3) and (5,4).\n- The apple at (3, 3) is very close, but my body at (4, 3) blocks direct access.\n- The apple at (2, 3) is also blocked by my body at (4, 3).\n- Moving **UP** to (5, 4) puts me in a very tight corridor between my own body segments at (4,4) and (5,5).\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 3) takes me toward the open right side of the board and eventually toward the apples at (7, 8) and (8, 8).\n- Snake 0 is at (2, 5). If I move RIGHT, I increase distance from it.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving RIGHT is the safest way to untangle from my own body segments and head toward open space. Moves LEFT and DOWN are instant deaths. UP enters a narrow one-block wide slot that might trap me.\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\nMove RIGHT to (6, 3), then likely RIGHT again or DOWN to circle around the tail and clear the head from the body cluster. Once clear, target the apples on the right or loop back for (2, 1).\n\nRIGHT",

Since my body is blocking the direct path to (5, 8) via x=6, I will likely need to move DOWN and around the bottom of my tail (at 5, 3) or move toward the right/bottom walls to navigate back toward the center.\n\nPlan:\nMove DOWN to collect the apple at (8, 5).\n\nDOWN",

Only (7, 7) is free.\nFrom (7, 7), neighbors are (7, 8), (7, 6), (6, 7), (8, 7). All these will be body parts. \nMoving to (7, 6) leads to a dead end because I am inside a \"pocket\" of my own segments. \n\nHowever, moving DOWN to (7, 4) is safe and keeps me in open space. From (7, 4), I can move LEFT to (6, 4) (No, body is there) or RIGHT to (8, 4) or DOWN to (7, 3).\nWait, the body at (6, 4) and (6, 3) will move forward. Let's look at the tail. The tail is at (6, 3). It will move to (6, 4) and then disappear.\nThe best path to reach the other apples (5, 4, 5, 8, etc.) is to go around the bottom of my current tail or wait for the body to clear.\n\nMove DOWN to (7, 4) avoids getting trapped in the (7, 6) pocket.\n\nUP\nUP (Actually, wait, if I take the apple, I grow. Taking the apple at (7, 6) is risky but I am behind in points. However, death is worse. Let's look at the pocket again. If I move UP, UP, I am trapped. I must go DOWN to stay alive.)\n\nRE-EVALUATION: My head is (7, 5). The apple is (7, 6). If I move UP I gain a point. If I move DOWN I stay in the game.

However, moving into the tail cell as it vacates is generally risky, but (6, 4) is currently body.\n3. **RIGHT**: (8, 4). This cell is empty.\n4. **DOWN**: (7, 3). This cell is empty.\n\nAnalysis of Safe Moves:\n- **RIGHT (8, 4)**: Safe. It keeps me away from the \"pocket\" I was avoiding earlier.\n- **DOWN (7, 3)**: Safe. It also keeps me in open space.\n\nEvaluating Strategy:\nThe apple at (5, 4) is quite close. To get there, I need to loop around my tail or wait for the body to clear. My tail at (6, 4) is moving towards (6, 5), then (6, 6), etc.\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 4), I can eventually circle around the bottom to reach (5, 4).\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 3), I am also heading towards open space.\n\nHowever, I must avoid the snake body at (6, 4-8).\nCurrent Scores: Me (11), Enemy (12). I need apples.\nThe apple at (7, 6) is still inside my body's \"u-shape\". If I move (7, 4) -> (8, 4) -> (8, 3) -> (7, 3) -> (6, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (5, 4), I can grab that apple.\n\nLet's check the RIGHT move (8, 4):\nNext head: (8, 4)\nNext body segments: (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5). (Tail at 6, 4 disappears).\nThis is very safe and opens up the right side and bottom of the board.\n\nDOWN (7, 3) is also safe. Either path works, but RIGHT (8, 4) keeps me slightly further from the enemy's potential pathing if they decide to come across the middle.\n\nRIGHT seems the most flexible.\n\nRIGHT",

DOWN \u2192 (1,\u202f6) would run into our own body.\n- The apple at (1,\u202f8) is directly above our head; moving UP collects it immediately.\n- Enemy snake #1 is far away (head at (7,\u202f4)) and cannot reach (1,\u202f8) in one move; its only safe moves are DOWN to (7,\u202f3) or RIGHT to (8,\u202f4), so no risk of a head\u2011on collision.\n- After eating the apple our length increases to 14, the tail moves from (2,\u202f4) to (2,\u202f3), leaving a clear path forward.\n- UP therefore maximizes short\u2011term score while keeping future options open.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan for the next few turns**\n\nOnce we have the apple at (1,\u202f8), we will be at (1,\u202f8) with a compact shape. The next priority is to head toward the remaining apples, likely (5,\u202f8) or (4,\u202f9), while monitoring the enemy\u2019s movement (expected to go DOWN or RIGHT).

It is currently maneuvering near the top wall. It poses no immediate threat to the apples at (5, 4) or (4, 2).\n\n**4. Strategy:**\nThe apple at (5, 4) is directly adjacent to my head.

This is risky as it limits mobility.\n\n**3. Enemy Analysis:**\nSnake #0 is at (4, 8) and moving. It is currently at the top of the board. The apple at (5, 8) is very close to it. I should focus on the apples in the center or bottom left to avoid a direct confrontation while I am currently \"wrapped\" around myself.\n\n**4. Strategy:**\nMoving **LEFT** to (4, 4) is the safest tactical choice. It distances my head from my dense body cluster (x=7, x=8) and gives me the most room to maneuver.

Safe. Moves towards apples at (2, 6) and (6, 7).\n- **DOWN**: (4, 3). Safe. Moves towards apple at (4, 2).\n- **LEFT**: (3, 4). Safe. Moves into open space away from the cluster and toward apple (2, 6).\n- **RIGHT**: (5, 4). **DEATH** (Backward move into neck).\n\n2. **Refining Safe Moves and Strategy:**\n- Snake #0 (Enemy) is at (5, 8). Its body blocks paths along the x=1, 2, 3, 4 columns at the top.\n- My own body is clustered on the right (x=7, 8).\n- **DOWN to (4, 3)** is a strong move because it targets the apple at (4, 2) directly. From (4, 3), if I go to (4, 2), I'll be at (4, 2) while the enemy is likely occupied at the top.\n- **LEFT to (3, 4)** is also good for space, but (4, 3) makes literal progress toward the nearest apple (4, 2).\n- **UP to (4, 5)** puts me closer to the enemy snake and limits my vertical space since the enemy body is at (4, 8) and (4, 9).\n\n3. **Risk Assessment:**\nThe apple at (4, 2) is the most isolated and safest for me to grab without interference from Snake #0. Snake #0 is currently at (5, 8). If it heads south, we might meet, but I have more lateral space in the bottom half of the map.\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\nMove DOWN to (4, 3), then DOWN again to (4, 2) to collect the apple. After that, assess if I should swing LEFT toward (2,6) or RIGHT toward (9,2).\n\nDOWN",

This move takes me into the open column 3, potentially heading towards apples at (2, 5) and (2, 6).\n- **DOWN**: (3, 1). **Safe**. This moves into the open bottom area, heading towards the apple at (7, 1).\n- **LEFT**: (2, 2). **Safe**. This moves closer to the left wall and toward apples at (2, 5) and (2, 6).\n- **RIGHT**: (4, 2). **DEATH** (Backward move into neck).\n\n2. **Refining Strategy:**\n- Staying away from the center-right body cluster is crucial. The enemy snake (Snake #0) is at (6, 6), which is move distance 7 away from my head, so there is no immediate collision risk.\n- The path UP to (3, 3) followed by LEFT to (2, 3) and then UP allows me to approach (2, 5) and (2, 6) from a position that keeps the left wall as a safety buffer.\n- The path DOWN to (3, 1) and then RIGHT toward (7, 1) or (9, 2) is very open and low-risk.\n- **LEFT** to (2, 2) is a very solid move. From (2, 2), I can go UP to (2, 3), (2, 4) to grab (2, 5) and (2, 6) in a straight line, while staying far from my own body and the enemy snake.\n\n3. **Evaluation:**\n- Moving LEFT to (2, 2) aligns the snake for a vertical sweep of the apples at (2, 5) and (2, 6). This is the most efficient path to multiple apples while remaining in the most open part of the board.\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\nMove LEFT to (2, 2), then move UP to collect the apples at (2, 5) and (2, 6). This keeps me clear of the congestion at (4, 2)-(8, 6). After collecting those, I can loop around the top or head back down the column 0/1 area.\n\nLEFT",

This leads directly towards apples at (2, 5) and (2, 6).\n- **DOWN**: (2, 1). **Safe**. This moves into open space at the bottom.\n- **LEFT**: (1, 2). **DEATH** (Snake #0's body is at (1, 2)).\n- **RIGHT**: (3, 2). **DEATH** (Backward move into neck).\n\n2. **Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n- **UP to (2, 3)**: This is the most efficient path to the nearest apples. The cells (2, 3) and (2, 4) are currently empty. Moving UP puts me on a direct path to (2, 5) and (2, 6).\n- **DOWN to (2, 1)**: This is safe but moves away from the cluster of apples at (2, 5) and (2, 6). While it heads toward (7, 1), that apple is farther away and requires crossing near my own body length.\n\n3. **Enemy Watch (Snake #0):**\n- Snake #0 is at (5, 6). Its current trajectory and body placement suggest it is maneuvering in the upper-middle area. It is 4 units away from the apple at (2, 6), whereas I am 4 units away as well. However, my path up column 2 is relatively protected from its current body position.\n\n4. **Strategic Choice:**\n- Moving UP is the strongest move. It follows the plan established in the previous turn to harvest the apples at (2, 5) and (2, 6). It keeps me away from my own body segments at (4, 2) and beyond.\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\nContinue moving UP to (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), and (2, 6). This will secure two apples. After reaching (2, 6), evaluate the position of Snake #0 (likely at the top of the board) and decide whether to head right across the top or loop back down column 0.\n\nUP",

Analyze Potential Moves from (2, 4):**\n- **UP**: (2, 5). Target apple at (2, 5). **Safe**.\n- **DOWN**: (2, 3). **DEATH** (Backward move into neck).\n- **LEFT**: (1, 4). **DEATH** (Enemy body/tail segment).\n- **RIGHT**: (3, 4). **Safe**. This enters an area surrounded by my own body and the enemy snake's current head.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n- **UP to (2, 5)**: This allows me to collect the apple at (2, 5). Note that the enemy snake (ID 0) is at (3, 6). If I move to (2, 5), there is a chance the enemy snake also moves to (2, 5) if they go LEFT and then DOWN, or if they move to (2, 6). However, from (3, 6), the enemy snake can move to (2, 6) in one turn. If I am at (2, 5) and they are at (2, 6), the apple at (2, 6) will be contested.\n- **RIGHT to (3, 4)**: This is less productive as the apples are to the north and the enemy snake is currently blocking the path eastward at row 6.\n\n**3. Future Turn Planning:**\nMoving UP to (2, 5) secures an apple. The enemy snake at (3, 6) is very close to the apple at (2, 6). If they move LEFT to (2, 6), they get that apple. If I move UP to (2, 5), I get that apple. We must be careful about a head-on collision at (2, 6) on the subsequent turn. However, for this turn, (2, 5) is open.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nGrab the apple at (2, 5). Observe Snake #0's move. If Snake #0 moves to (2, 6), I will need to turn away (likely LEFT to (1, 5) if it becomes vacant or find another path) to avoid a collision. If they move elsewhere, I will attempt to secure (2, 6) or (0, 6) area.\n\nUP",

Eating it now increases our score to 18 apples, keeping us ahead of the opponent (13 apples).  \n\n- **Enemy consideration**: The opponent\u2019s head is at (2,4). Their only safe moves are UP to (2,5) or RIGHT to (3,4).  \n  - If they move UP to (2,5) they will eat the apple there, but that does not interfere with our move to (2,6).  \n  - If they move RIGHT to (3,4) they stay away from our path.  \n  - In either case, moving LEFT does **not** cause a head\u2011on collision on this turn.  \n\n- **Future plan**: After eating (2,6) we will have a new head at (2,6). The next logical step is to avoid a potential head\u2011on collision with the opponent (who may be at (2,5) after their move) by moving **UP** to (2,7) on turn\u202f58. From there we can safely circle toward the remaining apples on the right side of the board (e.g., (7,6) or (9,2)) while keeping many escape routes open.\n\n**Move for turn\u202f57:**  \nLEFT",

This cell is currently occupied by Snake #0's body.\n    *   **DOWN**: (3, 4). **SAFE**. This cell is currently empty.\n    *   **LEFT**: (2, 5). **DEATH** (Backward move into neck).\n    *   **RIGHT**: (4, 5). **SAFE**. This cell is currently empty.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Safe Moves (DOWN vs RIGHT):**\n    *   **RIGHT to (4, 5)**: This move stays in row 5. Note the board layout: Snake #0 is currently at row 6 (head at 2, 6 and body extending across). My own body is at row 4 (cells 4, 4 and 5, 4). Moving to (4, 5) keeps me in a narrow corridor. However, it moves me closer to the open space on the right (x=7, x=8, x=9) where the apples are located.\n    *   **DOWN to (3, 4)**: This cell is adjacent to my body at (2, 4), (4, 4), and (3, 2). It leads into a very cramped \"pocket\" created by my own body segments. Moving here risks getting trapped or having to navigate a self-imposed maze.\n\n3.  **Enemy Consideration (Snake #0):**\n    *   Snake #0's head is at (2, 7). Its possible moves are (1, 7) - body, (3, 7) - empty, (2, 8) - body, or (2, 6) - body. It is essentially forced to move to (3, 7). This move doesn't immediately threaten (4, 5).\n\n4.  **Strategy:**\n    The goal is to reach the cluster of apples at the bottom right: (7, 6), (9, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0), (8, 0). \n    Moving **RIGHT** to (4, 5) is the most efficient path toward the x=7+ region. While the corridor is narrow (y=5, with bodies at y=4 and y=6), there are no body segments at (5, 5), (6, 5), or (7, 5). This allows a clear path to break out of the middle-left cluster and reach the apples.\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\nContinue moving RIGHT through the y=5 corridor until reaching x=7. Then, maneuver downward to collect the high concentration of apples at (7, 6), (9, 2), (7, 1), and (8, 0). Avoid Snake #0 while navigating the corridor.\n\nRIGHT",

Its options are limited; it will likely move toward the right side of the board soon.\n    *   The apple cluster is primarily in the bottom right corner (7, 1), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 2) and one at (7, 6).\n\n3.  **Pathfinding for Move RIGHT (5, 5):**\n    *   Moving to (5, 5) is the only survivable move this turn.\n    *   From (5, 5), the next cell to the right is (6, 5), which is currently free.\n    *   The goal is to reach x=7 or x=8 where there is vertical clearance.

I must secure the bottom-right cluster to close the gap.\n    *   Snake #0's body is long and winding at the top-left/middle. By moving right, I am moving into more open space.\n\n**Future Plan:**\nContinue moving RIGHT until (7, 5). At that point, assess the position of Snake #0's head.

Consequently, after this move we will have no safe moves left and will die on the next turn.\n\n- **Enemy situation**  \n  The enemy\u2019s only safe move from (5,5) is **RIGHT** to (6,5). They cannot move into our body without dying, and they have no immediate head\u2011on collision with us.\n\n- **Plan for the next turn**  \n  Since we will be trapped after moving RIGHT, our best hope is to die on the same turn as the enemy (e.g., if the enemy also becomes trapped or runs into a wall). Because we currently have more apples (18\u202fvs\u202f14), a simultaneous death would make us the winner.\n\n**Plan for the next few turns**  \n1. Move RIGHT now to (5,7).  \n2.
