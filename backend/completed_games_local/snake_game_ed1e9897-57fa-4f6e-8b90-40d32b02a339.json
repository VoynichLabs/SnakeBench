Eliminate unsafe moves:\n- **RIGHT** (10,6): Off the board \u2192 **UNSAFE**\n- **LEFT** (8,6): Safe (empty space)\n- **UP** (9,7): Safe (empty space)\n- **DOWN** (9,5): Safe (empty space)\n\n### 2. Apple positions:\n- (1,2), (8,9), (6,3), (2,9), (4,2)\n\n### 3. Enemy snake #0:\n- At (8,0) - far away\n\n### 4. Evaluating safe moves:\n\n**LEFT (8,6):**\n- Moves toward center of board\n- Keeps multiple options open for next turn\n- Moves away from right wall, more flexible positioning\n\n**UP (9,7):**\n- Moves toward top-right edge, more restrictive\n- Limited follow-up options (can't go right further)\n\n**DOWN (9,5):**\n- Moves toward bottom-right edge\n- Still some follow-up options available\n\n### 5. Strategic considerations:\n\nThe closest apple to me is (8,9) which is 3 units away (1 left, 2 up). Enemy snake #0 is at (8,0), so they might be targeting a different apple (possibly (6,3) or (1,2)).\n\nMoving LEFT gives me the most flexibility while positioning me better to reach (8,9) on future moves.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Move LEFT to (8,6), then continue moving toward apple (8,9) at top-left. Watch for enemy snake #0's movements and avoid head-on collisions.\n\nRIGHT",

Keeps us alive this turn.  \n2. Begins to climb toward the apple at (8,9), the closest high\u2011value target.  \n3. Leaves multiple follow\u2011up directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) available for the next turn, preserving flexibility.\n\n**Short\u2011term plan**\n\n> Move up to (8,1) this turn, then continue upward while monitoring the enemy\u2019s possible leftward moves. If the path upward becomes blocked, branch left or right to stay clear of collisions and keep heading for the (8,9) apple.\n\nUP\nUP",
