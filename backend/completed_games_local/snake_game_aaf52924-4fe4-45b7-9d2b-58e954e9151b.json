We can gobble it in two moves (LEFT\u2011LEFT) and start growing. \ud83c\udf4e  \n- **UP** would net an apple at **(8,9)** after two ups \u2013 also tasty, but it forces us up the board where the opponent might cut us off from the left side later.  \n- **RIGHT** heads toward the edge and the next apple is at **(9,9)** \u2013 a longer trek with no immediate payoff.  \n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Future\u2011proofing & board control  \nGoing **LEFT** gives us a nice \u201cwiggle room\u201d corridor: after (7,7) we can swing **UP** to grab the apple at (7,8) *or* keep heading **LEFT** to (6,7). Both routes keep multiple safe exits and keep the opponent on our tail.  \n\n### Quick long\u2011term game plan  \n1. **Turn\u202f1:** LEFT \u2192 (7,7).  \n2. **Turn\u202f2:** LEFT again \u2192 (6,7) \u2192 *eat apple, grow to length\u202f2*.  \n3. Afterwards, orbit the left\u2011side cluster (apples at (5,6), (5,5? none), (5,3)\u2026) while the opponent is forced to chase us up/down the middle column.  \n4. Use our growing body as a wall; when the opponent tries to close in, we can force a head\u2011on **collision** where we have the higher apple count.  \n\nAll signs point to the safest, most aggressive, apple\u2011rich path: **LEFT**.  \n\n**Let\u2019s roll!** \ud83d\ude80  \n\nLEFT",

He's directly above me! This is a VERTICAL standoff on the right side of the board.\n\n**IMMEDIATE THREAT ANALYSIS:**\nIf I go UP, I go to (8,6). If he goes DOWN, he goes to (8,6). That's a HEAD-ON COLLISION! Since we're the same length (0 apples), that's a DOUBLE KO! We can't have that on turn 1! So UP is a potential death trap if he goes down. But is he gonna do that? Maybe not, it's risky for him too. But we can't risk it.\n\n**SAFETY CHECK - POSSIBLE MOVES:**\n*   UP: (8,6) - Empty cell. BUT risk of head-on collision if enemy goes DOWN.\n*   DOWN: (8,4) - Empty cell. Safe.\n*   LEFT: (7,5) - Empty cell. Safe.\n*   RIGHT: (9,5) - OOPS! That's off the board! (x=9 is valid, but next is x=10 which is invalid). Wait, re-reading... coordinates go from 0 to 9. So (9,5) is the FAR RIGHT EDGE. That's actually ON the board! My bad! So RIGHT is valid and goes to (9,5), which is empty. Safe.\n\nSo all four moves are *technically* safe from walls and bodies right now.\n\n**STRATEGY & AGGRESSION:**\nWe wanna box him in! He's up in the corner. If I go LEFT to (7,5), I'm moving towards the center, giving myself more space and options. If I go DOWN to (8,4), I'm also moving away. But going RIGHT to (9,5) pushes me into the corner... that might be bad long-term. We want to control the board!\n\nThe BEST aggressive move might be UP to (8,6) to challenge him directly! But since we're tied in length, it's a gamble. If he chickens out and goes left/right/up, I take the space below him and we live to fight another turn. But if he goes down, we both die. Too risky for turn 1. We need to grow first!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:**\nWe need to get our first apple to get a length advantage. THEN we can force head-on collisions to win. Looking at the apples, the closest one to me is at (8,9) way up north, or (7,4) down and left, or (5,0) far away. The enemy is closer to the (8,9) apple. We should grab an apple he can't easily get. Let's move towards the center-left apples to build our length and map control. Avoid getting pinned against the right wall.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nEliminating UP because it's a coin-flip for death on turn 1. Not worth it. RIGHT puts me in the corner. DOWN is safe but doesn't advance our position much. LEFT to (7,5) is the play! It moves me towards the center of the board, opens up more options for next turn, and starts our journey towards the apples on the left side. It's the smart, aggressive move for long-term domination!\n\nLET'S MAKE OUR MOVE! LEFT",

So we avoid **DOWN**.  \n- **Safe options:** **UP** \u2192 (7,8) (apple), **LEFT** \u2192 (6,7) (apple), **RIGHT** \u2192 (8,7) (empty). All three are out of the opponent\u2019s one\u2011step reach.  \n\n**Why LEFT?**  \n1. **Apple grab:** (6,7) holds an apple, so we grow to length\u202f2 instantly, increasing board control.  \n2. **Cluster positioning:** From (6,7) we\u2019re adjacent to a rich apple cluster on the left side (e.g., (5,6), (5,3), (5,2)). This lets us keep feeding while the opponent stays stuck around column\u202f7.  \n3. **Future choke\u2011point:** Being left of the opponent\u2019s column lets us swing back right later, potentially cutting off his escape routes and forcing a head\u2011on when we have the higher score.  \n4. **Safety:** The opponent cannot reach (6,7) in one move, so no immediate collision risk.  \n\n**Short\u2011term plan:**  \n- **Turn\u202f1:** **LEFT** \u2192 eat apple at (6,7).  \n- **Turn\u202f2:** aim for another nearby apple (e.g., **DOWN** to (6,6) or **LEFT** to (5,7)) while staying out of his immediate reach.  \n- Continue to grow on the left side and use our longer body as a wall to limit his movements, setting up a forced collision when we lead in apples.  \n\n**Decision:** Go for the immediate apple and the left\u2011side advantage.  \n\nLEFT",

But now my body is one segment long since I moved last turn.\n\n**IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL CHECK (Don't die!):**\n\n*   **UP \u2192 (7,6)**: Empty cell. But BIG RISK: If enemy goes DOWN to (7,6), it's a HEAD-ON COLLISION! We both die instantly. Since we're same length (0 apples each), it's a DOUBLE KO. \u274c Too risky!\n*   **DOWN \u2192 (7,4)**: Empty cell. Safe. \u2705\n*   **LEFT \u2192 (6,5)**: Empty cell.

It's safe. \u2705\n\nSo all moves are *technically* safe from walls and static bodies. BUT the danger is the enemy's *next move*.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION & AGGRESSION:**\nWhere will he go? His options:\n*   UP to (7,8) - towards apple at (7,8)? Seems likely, it's a free snack!\n*   DOWN to (7,6) - risky head-on if I go up.\n*   LEFT to (6,7) - possible.\n*   RIGHT to (8,7) - also possible.\n\nIf he goes for the apple at (7,8), he grows and gets a length advantage! We can't let that happen! We need to be aggressive and contest the space.\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN FOR TURNS 1-3:**\nWe need our first apple ASAP to get a length advantage! THEN we can bully him. Let's look at the board. The closest apples to ME are: (7,4) below me (DOWN) and (5,2) far left. The apple HE is near is (7,8). Moving UP challenges him directly but is super risky. Moving LEFT gets me closer to the cluster of apples on the left side (like (5,2), (5,0), (3,0)) which is GOOD for long-term growth and map control. Moving DOWN grabs the easy apple at (7,4) but pushes me away from the center.\n\n**THE GAMBLE:**\nIf I go LEFT to (6,5), I'm moving towards the center-left apple farm AND I'm also moving *diagonally away* from his potential DOWN move. This feels smart and safe.\nIf I go UP... it's an all-in bet. If he goes UP for the apple, we live and I'm right on his tail. If he goes DOWN, we both die on Turn 2. Is it worth it? MAYBE NOT YET. We need to be a bit smarter.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:**\nThe aggressive but *calculated* move is **LEFT** to (6,5). It avoids the immediate head-on collision risk, starts our journey to the left-side apples, and keeps our options wide open for next turn. We live to fight another turn and build our power!\n\nLET'S GO! LEFT",

He can't go there. \u274c\n*   UP to (6,8) - possible, but away from the action.\n\nHe's probably going DOWN for that apple and the chance to kill me. That means I CANNOT go UP.\n\n**SHORT-TERM STRATEGY FOR TURNS 2-4:**\nWe need an apple FAST to even the score! The closest safe apples are:\n*   LEFT: (5,3), (5,0) - Getting closer to that left-side cluster.\n*   DOWN: (7,4) - A bit further now, but still an option.\n*   RIGHT: No immediate apples, but opens space.\n\nGoing LEFT continues our plan from last turn - heading towards the left-side apple farm. It also moves us AWAY from the enemy's direct line of attack. This feels smart.\n\nGoing RIGHT moves us parallel to the enemy but keeps us in the center. Could be useful for future positioning.\n\n**THE GAMBLE:**\nWe need to be aggressive but SMART. Going for the left-side apples is a solid growth strategy. We avoid the direct confrontation until we have the length advantage.\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:**\nThe move that continues our plan, avoids the immediate danger zone, and heads towards resources is **LEFT** to (5,5). Let's secure that first apple and start building our power! We'll box him in later!\n\nLEFT",

It's riskier.\n\nUP to (5,6) moves me away from the apples. RIGHT to (6,5) moves me TOWARDS the enemy.

If he goes DOWN, and I go RIGHT, it's game over for me.\n\n**AGGRESSION vs. SURVIVAL:**\nWe have 0 apples. He has 3. A head-on collision is SUICIDE. We MUST avoid that possibility at all costs. Therefore, moving RIGHT is EXTREMELY RISKY. We should probably eliminate it unless we're feeling insanely lucky. \ud83d\udd12\n\n**APPLE PATH & SAFE ROUTES:**\nOur goal is still to get our first apple to even the playing field! The closest apples are below us: (5,3) and (5,0). To get there, we need to go DOWN eventually.\n\n*   **DOWN \u2192 (4,4)**: Gets us closer to the apples! Also, look at the enemy: if he goes DOWN to (5,5), I'm moving AWAY from him. If he goes LEFT to (4,6), we're moving parallel but not intersecting. SAFE path to content! \ud83c\udf4e\n*   **LEFT \u2192 (3,5)**: Moves us sideways. There's an apple at (3,5)? Wait, the board shows (3,5) as 'A'! THERE'S AN APPLE TO OUR LEFT! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e This is HUGE! Going LEFT eats an apple IMMEDIATELY! We grow to length 2 and tie the score at 3-3! This is MASSIVE!\n*   **UP \u2192 (4,6)**: Moves us away from the immediate apple opportunities. Less optimal.\n\n**THE DECISION:**\nLEFT gets us an APPLE this very turn, boosting our length and score to match the enemy! This completely changes the game dynamics. After eating, our body will be at [(3,5), (4,5)], making us harder to kill. This is the clear power play.\n\nDOWN is safe and progresses toward other apples, but it delays our growth.\n\nRIGHT is a potential death trap.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN FOR TURNS 5-7:**\nAfter eating the apple at (3,5), we'll be at length 2. Our immediate goal is to survive and maybe trap the enemy. We should consider moving DOWN or LEFT on the next turn to consolidate our position and avoid being cornered. Once our length is equal, we can start considering aggressive head-on collisions if the opportunity arises!\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:**\nThe move is **LEFT** to (3,5)! LET'S GET THAT CONTENT AND LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD! IT'S GO TIME! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udfaf\n\nLEFT",

But look at his body!\n*   **DOWN to (2,3):** \u2705 **SAFE!** Empty cell. Puts us near apples at (2,1) and (3,3). Strategic retreat!\n*   **LEFT to (1,4):** \u2705 **SAFE!** Empty cell.

That's an AGGRESSIVE TRAP! \ud83e\udea4\n*   If he goes UP or LEFT, we're just sitting at (2,5), which is safe and close to the apple at (2,7) for next turn.\n\nThis is a HIGH-REWARD PLAY! We force him to make a choice that could end him! If we go DOWN or LEFT, we're just running away. We need to be PREDATORS, not prey! Let's put the pressure ON!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR MY FUTURE SELF):**\nSET THE TRAP! Go UP and challenge his space. If he takes the bait and crashes into us, WE WIN THE EXCHANGE!

I MISREAD THE BOARD ON THE LAST TURN! \ud83d\ude31 Snake #0 is VERY MUCH ALIVE with 5 apples! His head is at (2,9)! We only have 1 apple! We are the UNDERDOGS!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION (Turn 10):**\n*   **Our Head:** (4, 5) \ud83d\udc51\n*   **Our Body:** [(3, 5)] (Just one segment behind us!)\n*   **Enemy Head:** (2, 9) \ud83d\udc80 (He's long! Score is 5 to 1!)\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER ASSESSMENT:**\nFrom (4,5), where can our enemy move? His head is at (2,9). His possible moves are:\n*   UP to (2,10): \u274c OFF THE BOARD! DEATH. He won't do that.\n*   DOWN to (2,8): \u2705 SAFE for him. That's his own body segment, but it's BEHIND his head (his neck), so it's safe for him to move into.\n*   LEFT to (1,9): \u2705 SAFE for him. Empty cell.\n*   RIGHT to (3,9): \u2705 SAFE for him. Empty cell.\n\nHe's far away, so no immediate head-on collision risk this turn. But he's LONGER, so we MUST avoid a head-on collision right now. We'd lose!\n\n**CHECKING OUR MOVE OPTIONS FROM (4,5):**\n*   **UP to (4,6):** \u274c **DEATH!** That's the enemy's body segment (part of Snake #0's tail). CRASH! \ud83d\udc80\n*   **DOWN to (4,4):** \u2705 **SAFE!** Empty cell. Puts us in a more open area.\n*   **LEFT to (3,5):** \ud83e\udd14 **DEBATABLE!** That's our OWN NECK! Our body segment is right behind our head. Moving left would be moving backwards into our own body? **WAIT! Let's check the rules:** \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)? That's hitting yourself. You're DEAD.\"\n    Our head is at (4,5). Our only body segment is at (3,5), which is directly to the LEFT. So moving LEFT is moving **BACKWARDS** into our neck. \ud83d\udc80 **SUICIDE! NOT ALLOWED!** \u274c\n*   **RIGHT to (5,5):** \u2705 **SAFE!** Empty cell. Opens up the right side.\n\nSo our ONLY safe moves are **DOWN** and **RIGHT**.\n\n**STRATEGY & AGGRESSION METER:**\nWe are smaller (length 2 vs his length 6). Our goal is to **GROW SAFELY** and **AVOID** him until we can challenge him.\n*   **DOWN (4,4):** Gets us away from the enemy's body above us. There's an apple at (5,3) nearby. From (4,4), our next moves would be UP (back to 4,5), DOWN (4,3), LEFT (3,4), RIGHT (5,4). Pretty open! Good options.\n*   **RIGHT (5,5):** Also safe. Puts us closer to apples at (5,3) and (5,0). From (5,5), next moves: UP (5,6) - SAFE, DOWN (5,4) - SAFE, LEFT (back to 4,5), RIGHT (6,5) - SAFE. Also very open!\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR MY FUTURE SELF):**\nWE ARE THE HUNTER, NOT THE HUNTED! ...but we're a small hunter right now. \ud83d\udc2d\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udc2f\n*   PRIORITY #1: EAT APPLES SAFELY! We need to close the score gap. Target (5,3) or (5,0).\n*   PRIORITY #2: TRACK THE ENEMY! He's long and can block paths. We need to anticipate his movement and stay in open space.\n*   AVOID HEAD-ON COLLISIONS until we have a longer or equal length! We lose that trade right now!\n*   Use our agility (we're short!) to navigate tight spaces he can't fit into.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are good. RIGHT feels slightly better because it moves us toward a cluster of apples (5,3, 5,0) and keeps us central. Let's go for the content!\n\nRIGHT",

We gotta play smart and SURVIVE!\n\n**CURRENT SITUATION (Turn 11):**\n*   **Our Head:** (5, 5) \ud83d\udc51\n*   **Our Body:** [(4, 5)] (Still just one segment!)\n*   **Enemy Head:** (3, 9) \ud83d\udc80 (His body: [(2,9), (2,8), (2,7), (2,6), (3,6)] - He's a monster!)\n\nLet's think this through! The enemy is far, but his long body is a WALL we have to respect! We can't get pinned!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER ASSESSMENT:**\nFrom (5,5), what kills us?\n*   **UP to (5,6):** \u2705 SAFE! Empty cell.\n*   **DOWN to (5,4):** \u2705 SAFE! Empty cell.\n*   **LEFT to (4,5):** \u274c **SUICIDE!** That's our OWN NECK! Our body segment is right there! Moving backwards = DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n*   **RIGHT to (6,5):** \u2705 SAFE! Empty cell.\n\nSo our safe moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION & COLLISION CHECK:**\nWhere can the enemy (head at 3,9) move?\n*   UP to (3,10): \u274c Off board! He won't do that.\n*   DOWN to (3,8): \u2705 Safe for him. Empty.\n*   LEFT to (2,9): \u2705 Safe for him. That's his own neck, so it's safe.\n*   RIGHT to (4,9): \u2705 Safe for him. Empty.\n\nA head-on collision happens if we end up in the same cell. Let's check our safe moves against his possible moves:\n*   Our UP (5,6) vs his moves: No overlap. Safe.\n*   Our DOWN (5,4) vs his moves: No overlap. Safe.\n*   Our RIGHT (6,5) vs his moves: No overlap. Safe.\n\nNo risk of direct head-on collision this turn! PHEW!\n\n**STRATEGY & APPLE HUNTING:**\nWe need to GROW! We gotta close that 5-to-1 gap! Looking at apples:\n*   (5,3) is close! We could go DOWN twice to get it.\n*   (5,0) is also down there!\n*   (7,4) and (7,6) are to the right.\n\nGoing DOWN gets us closer to that tasty (5,3) apple! Going RIGHT opens up the board and moves us toward other apples. UP takes us closer to the enemy's long body... that feels risky long-term.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR MY FUTURE SELF):**\nWE ARE IN SURVIVAL MODE! \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8\n*   PRIORITY #1: EAT APPLES SAFELY! Target (5,3) or (5,0). We need the content!\n*   PRIORITY #2: STAY AWAY FROM THE ENEMY'S BODY! That long snake is a moving maze. Keep our distance!\n*   PRIORITY #3: USE OUR SMALL SIZE! We can fit places he can't. Stay agile!\n*   AVOID HEAD-ON COLLISIONS! We lose that trade right now!\n\nGoing DOWN feels right. It puts us on a path to easy apples and keeps us away from the danger zone near the top of the board. Let's feast!\n\nDOWN",

But it puts us directly below him. If he keeps coming down, we could get pinned against the bottom wall. Risky long-term.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 3):** Moves us AWAY from his path! Puts us near the (3,3) and (2,3) apples! This is SMART positioning. We avoid a direct confrontation and set up for more food.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 3):** Also moves us away from his path! But the nearest apple is (8,5), which is far. Not as efficient.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN (FOR MY FUTURE SELF):**\n*   **PRIORITY 1:** AVOID THE ENEMY'S PATH! He's coming down the (5, y) column.

From (9,\u202f9) I\u2019d be stuck on the edge with only two.\n- **Apple Hunt**: There\u2019s an apple at (7,\u202f8) just a step left, and a cluster down the column (8,\u202f5) to chase later.\n- **Boxing Potential**: Dropping down starts a \u201cU\u2011turn\u201d pattern that lets me swing back left, gradually squeezing the opponent\u2019s corridor while staying away from his short tail.\n\n**Short\u2011Term Plan**\n- **Turn 16**: Go **DOWN** to (8,\u202f8).  \n- **Turn\u202f17\u201118**: Peek left toward the apple (7,\u202f8), then curve back left along the top edge, corralling the enemy toward the bottom\u2011left wall.  \n- **Keep eyes on the opponent\u2019s move** \u2013 if he tries to rush up, I\u2019ll be ready with a head\u2011on collision (I\u2019ve got the apple lead).\n\nLet\u2019s make that move and keep the pressure on!  \n\nDOWN",

No trap in a corner.\n3. **Opponent distance** \u2013 the rival is nowhere near (7,\u202f7); any of its three legal moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) can\u2019t clash with us this turn, so there\u2019s zero head\u2011on risk.\n4. **Boxing potential** \u2013 expanding downwards lets us start a \u201cU\u2011turn\u201d that will shepherd the enemy toward his cramped bottom\u2011left arena while we dominate the high\u2011ground.\n\n**Short\u2011term game plan (next few turns)**  \n\n- **Turn\u202f19**: **DOWN** to (7,\u202f7) \u2192 eat apple, grow.  \n- **Turn\u202f20\u201122**: Continue left along row\u202f7, then drop down the left side, squeezing the opponent into the lower\u2011left corner.  \n- Keep an eye on his possible moves (likely drifting toward (1,\u202f1) or (3,\u202f1)); be ready to intercept with a head\u2011on if we maintain the apple lead.\n\nLet\u2019s grab that apple and tighten the net!  \n\nDOWN",

He's got two apples near him! He's about to get even MORE MASSIVE. This is TERRIBLE.\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN**\nWe are WAY behind. 7 vs 11 (after he eats). We cannot fight him head-on.

Next turn we could go UP to (1,3), RIGHT to (2,2) (but that's our body? Wait, check... our body is at (2,2)? Yes! So no. Wait, our body: [(0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)]. So (2,2) is our body. So from (1,2), we could go UP (1,3) or DOWN (1,1) (our body) or RIGHT (2,2) (our body). Actually... from (1,2), only UP (1,3) is safe? That's still better than being trapped on the edge. It keeps us in the game.\n\n**THE VERDICT**\nWe need to play the long game. We can't just greedily eat apples into a corner. We need to maintain mobility. Going RIGHT gives us more future options. Going UP is greedy and might box us in. Let's be patient, chat. We live to fight another turn. We go RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

We just left that spot.\n*   **RIGHT \u2192 (2, 2):** \u274c **DEATH!** Yep, that's our body too. Looks like our tail is still taking up space.\n\nSo... ONLY **UP** is safe? WAIT, HOLD UP. Let me double-check that board state. The visualization shows our head at (1,2) and our body trailing behind... yep, (0,2), (0,1), etc. So our immediate surroundings are FULL of us. UP is the ONLY escape.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION \u2013 WHAT'S SNAKE #0 PLANNING?** \ud83d\udc0d\nHis head is at (7,4). He's surrounded by apples! He can go:\n- UP (7,5): Into his own body? His body is at (7,5)... YES! That's a suicide move. He won't do that.\n- DOWN (7,3): Empty cell. Safe.\n- LEFT (6,4): Empty cell. Safe.\n- RIGHT (8,4): Empty cell. Safe.\n\nHe's gonna go for growth. He'll probably take the path of least resistance. We need to SURVIVE and hope he makes a mistake.\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN**\nWe are TRAPPED on the left side. Our only move is UP. This gets us to (1,3). From there, we need to think AHEAD. What's at (1,3)? Nothing. What's around it? Right (2,3) is our body. So from (1,3), our only safe move might be... UP to (1,4) (APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e) or maybe LEFT to (0,3) (APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e). So going UP now actually sets us up for a potential double-apple grab next turn, which would grow us to size 9. We need that growth desperately to even have a chance against the monster. This is risky, but it's our only play. We have to commit to the top-left corner and hope the enemy gets greedy and crashes.\n\n**THE VERDICT**\nNo choice, chat. We take the only exit. We go UP and pray for a miracle. We need to grow and hope Snake #0 hangs himself with all that length.\n\nUP",

We need to create space and look for apples to close the gap.\n\n*   **GOING UP (3,5)**: This moves us towards the top of the board, potentially towards apples at (5,8) or (9,7). It opens up future moves and creates distance from the immediate threat. This feels like the smarter, more conservative play to live to fight another turn.\n*   **GOING DOWN (3,3)**: This is the AGGRESSIVE BAIT! If the enemy goes LEFT to (3,3), we DIE in a head-on collision (and we lose). If he goes anywhere else, we're safe and now we're closer to the cluster of apples on the bottom rows (like (5,0), (3,0)). This is a HIGH-RISK move that relies on the enemy not calling our bluff.\n\nWe cannot afford to gamble right now. We need to play the odds. The enemy, with a massive lead, is more likely to play it safe and avoid a pointless conflict. Therefore, the safest bet for US is to also play it safe and create space.\n\n**THE VERDICT**\nWE TAKE THE HIGH GROUND! GOING UP keeps us alive, gives us more options next turn, and avoids walking directly into the enemy's most likely aggressive path. We live to stream another day!

This brings him closer to the center and potentially towards us.\n- RIGHT (5,1): \u2753 Empty. Safe move. Puts him near the apple at (5,0).\n\nHe has three safe moves. He's likely to go for an apple. DOWN to (4,0) or RIGHT to (5,1) both lead him to apples. This might pull him away from us, which is GOOD. We need space to grow.\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN**\nWe are executing the COMEBACK PLAN! Our body is coiled on the left side. Moving LEFT to (1,5) keeps us tight to our own body, which can act as a shield against the enemy. It also positions us to potentially swing up towards the apples at (0,7) and (1,7). Moving UP to (2,6) takes us into more open space but also further from our defensive coil and closer to the enemy's long body on the right.\n\nThe safest play is to stick to our body. We use our own length as a wall. LEFT is the move that continues our plan from last turn and minimizes the immediate threat from the enemy. We live to fight another turn and close the gap!\n\n**THE VERDICT**\nWE STICK TO THE PLAN! GOING LEFT keeps us safe against our own body and continues our path towards the left-side apples. We avoid the open board where the big snake can chase us. THE COMEBACK IS REAL! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

TRUST THE BOARD STATE! It's probably gone). But it's the SAFEST move, keeping our body as a wall.\n\nMoving UP to (1,6) takes us into more open territory. It puts distance between us and the enemy, who's stuck on the bottom. From (1,6), we can go UP to the apples at (1,7) or (0,7), or RIGHT to explore. This gives us more OPTIONS next turn.\n\nThe aggressive play is UP. We need to grow, and hiding in our coil won't close the gap. Let's take the open space, hunt those top-left apples, and force the enemy to come to us later when we're bigger!\n\n**THE VERDICT**\nWE GO FOR GROWTH! STAYING ALIVE IS KEY, BUT PLAYING TOO SAFE WON'T WIN US THE GAME! UP opens up the board and gets us moving towards content! LET'S PUSH! \ud83d\ude80\n\nUP",

The enemy is moving right... we might run into his massive tail if we chase.\n\nThe BEST move is UP to (1,7)! We GRAB THAT APPLE \ud83c\udf4e, growing to 8 apples! It puts us in a great spot. From (1,7), we can go LEFT to (0,7) (ANOTHER APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e), RIGHT to (2,7), or even UP to (1,8) if needed. We're expanding our territory, claiming the top-left corner, and building a power base! We force the enemy to come to US on our terms! THIS IS HOW WE CLUTCH!\n\n**FUTURE SELF, LISTEN UP!** Our body is our fortress on the left. Dominate the top-left quadrant. Consume the apples at (0,7), (2,8), (0,5 might be gone). Use our body to create a trap. Lure the enemy into a head-on collision when we have the length advantage! DON'T CHASE HIM INTO HIS TAIL! BE PATIENT AND GROW! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nUP",

We gotta use this!\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN**\nWE NEED TO DOMINATE THE LEFT SIDE! Our body is our fortress! We're in a great spot at (1,7). If we go LEFT to (0,7), we get that apple \ud83c\udf4e and grow to 9, solidifying our control of the top-left corner. From (0,7), our next moves can be UP to (0,8) or DOWN to (0,6). It keeps us safe along the wall.\n\nGoing RIGHT to (2,7) moves us into more open space, but it pushes us closer to the enemy's massive, winding body. That's risky! We don't want to get trapped by his tail.\n\nGoing UP to (1,8) is safe, but it doesn't get us an apple and might lead us into a dead end near the top wall. We need to be AGGRESSIVE and EFFICIENT! The apple is RIGHT THERE!\n\n**FUTURE SELF, LISTEN UP!** Our plan is working! We're building a base on the left. After grabbing (0,7), look to loop around. Maybe go DOWN to (0,6) and then RIGHT to (1,6) once our tail moves? Or go UP to (0,8) towards the apple at (2,8)? We need to keep growing to challenge his length advantage! Force him into a corner later! DON'T GET GREEDY AND CHASE HIM YET! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT",

It will move away as we slither! So next turn, (1,6) will likely be FREE! That opens up the entire center board for us! That's HUGE! We can then push RIGHT and start threatening his territory! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**FUTURE SELF, LISTEN UP!** GO DOWN! This sets us up for a major power play next turn.

The segment at (0,7) is NOT the neck, so it won't move away! Is it safe? \ud83e\udd14 Let's check the body list: Head (0,6), then (0,7) is next! **THAT'S OUR NECK!** IT *WILL* MOVE AWAY WHEN WE DO! So (0,7) becomes EMPTY this turn! \u2705 **SAFE!**\n*   **DOWN \u2192 (0, 5)**: \u2753 Empty cell! And apple at (0,5) is on Apple Drops list but NOT shown on the board? Board shows (0,5) as empty? Hmm, maybe the board ASCII is slightly delayed? Let's trust the Apple Drops list. Regardless, it's safe! \u2705\n*   **LEFT \u2192 (-1, 6)**: \u274c **DEATH!** Off the board! \ud83d\udeab\n*   **RIGHT \u2192 (1, 6)**: \u2753 Currently our body! But just like (0,7), it's our neck! It's the segment right after the head in our body list! It WILL move away! \u2705 **SAFE!**\n\nHOLY MOLY! WE HAVE THREE SAFE MOVES! UP, DOWN, RIGHT! LET'S GOOO! \ud83d\ude80\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION \u2013 WHERE IS SNAKE #0 GOING FROM (7, 1)?** \ud83d\udc0d\u26a0\ufe0f\n\nHis head is at (7,1). Options:\n- UP (7,2): \u2753 Empty! SAFE.\n- DOWN (7,0): \u274c **DEATH!** Apple at (7,0)? WAIT, check the BOARD! Cell (7,0) has an 'A'! So it's an APPLE! He can eat it! That moves his head to (7,0), his body grows, and the segment at (7,8) stays? Actually, his tail is at (7,8), so eating an apple means his tail doesn't move, he gains length. So (7,0) is SAFE for him! \u2705\n- LEFT (6,1): \u274c **DEATH!** His own body! \ud83d\udeab\n- RIGHT (8,1): \u2753 Empty! SAFE.\n\nHis safe moves are UP, DOWN (to eat the apple), RIGHT. He's gonna see that juicy apple at (7,0)! He's PROBABLY going DOWN to eat it! That would put his head at (7,0)!\n\n**STRATEGY & LONG-TERM PLAN \u2013 THE BOARD IS OUR OYSTER!** \ud83e\uddaa\n\nTHIS IS THE MOMENT! Our neck clears, opening up the center! Our score is 9 vs his 15. We need to close that gap AGGRESSIVELY!\n\n*   **UP to (0,7)**: Keeps us on the left edge. Apple at (0,5) is below us, apple at (2,8) is far. Feels a bit passive.\n*   **DOWN to (0,5)**: GRABS THE APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Instant growth to 10 apples! But then we're at the bottom-left corner. Our next moves from there are limited (probably only UP or RIGHT if our neck clears). Could be a trap!\n*   **RIGHT to (1,6)**: THIS IS THE PLAY! \ud83e\udd29 This moves us INTO THE CENTER OF THE BOARD! From (1,6), next turn we have SO many options! We can go UP, DOWN, or further RIGHT to chase the apple at (5,6) or start cutting off the enemy's path! We become a threat! We deny him space! This is about BOARD CONTROL! We can get apples LATER, right now we need to position ourselves to dominate!\n\n**FUTURE SELF, LISTEN UP!** WE'RE TAKING SPACE! GO RIGHT! This is an aggressive positioning move. Next turn, we'll have immense pressure. We might even be able to swing up and threaten a head-on collision if he's still low, since we're longer now and would win the tie! LET'S BOX HIM IN!\n\nRIGHT",
