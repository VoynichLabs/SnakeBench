Moving DOWN or RIGHT could threaten my space in future turns if I stay on the left side.\n- **Head-on collision risk**: If I move UP and enemy moves DOWN, we could collide at (0, 6) in two turns if both continue toward each other. Not immediate but worth noting.\n\n### Apple Proximity and Strategy\n\n- **Nearest apple to me**: (0, 0) is 4 units down, (2, 2) is 2 right + 2 down = 4 units.\n- **Enemy's nearest apple**: (5, 8) is 5 right + 0 up = 5 units, (0, 0) is farther for them.\n- Moving **RIGHT** opens paths to multiple apples: (2, 2), (3, 6), and eventually (5, 8) and (9, 0). It also avoids immediate confrontation with the enemy on the left edge.\n\n### Future Planning\n\n- **Long-term plan**: Move rightward to access central apples, maintain mobility, and avoid the enemy's immediate path. Prioritize apples at (2, 2) and (3, 6) first, then expand to others.\n- **Avoidance**: Stay aware of enemy movements; if they descend the left column, I should be moving right to avoid head-on collision or blocking.\n\nRIGHT",

If it moves DOWN, it could reach (3, 7) next turn. If it moves LEFT or RIGHT, it stays on row 8. No immediate collision threat at (2, 3) regardless of my move.\n- No risk of head-on collision this turn since enemy is on row 8 and I am on row 3.\n\n### Apple Proximity and Strategy\n\n- **Nearest apple to me**: (2, 2) is 1 down = 1 unit (Manhattan distance). (3, 6) is 1 right + 3 up = 4 units. (0, 0) is 2 left + 3 down = 5 units. (5, 8) is 3 right + 5 up = 8 units. (9, 0) is far.\n- Moving **DOWN** gets me directly to (2, 2) in one move, collecting the closest apple.\n- Moving **RIGHT** gets me closer to (3, 6) and (5, 8). Moving **LEFT** gets me closer to (0, 0). Moving **UP** gets me closer to (3, 6) and (5, 8).\n\n### Future Planning\n\n- **Short-term goal**: Head toward (2, 2) to collect the closest apple. Moving DOWN directly reaches it, giving me an apple and increasing my length to 2.\n- **Long-term plan**: After (2, 2), consider (3, 6) or (0, 0) depending on enemy position. Avoid the left edge if enemy descends, as it could block my path or force a head-on collision.\n- **Mobility**: Moving DOWN keeps all future directions open (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) from (2, 2), unlike moving LEFT which brings me closer to the edge.\n\n### Decision\n\n- **DOWN** is the best move. It moves me directly to the nearest apple (2, 2), collecting it immediately, increasing my length and score, while keeping future options open.\n\nDOWN",

None of these are adjacent to my head at (2, 2), so no immediate collision threat this turn.

Moving **DOWN** gets me closer to (0, 0) and (7, 0), but also brings me closer to the bottom edge, which could limit future mobility if I'm not careful.\n\n### Future Planning\n\n- **Short-term goal**: Head toward the nearest apple, which is (0, 0) or (7, 0). Both are relatively close. (0, 0) is slightly closer.\n- Moving **LEFT** toward (0, 0) is a good choice.

The enemy would need to move down and left to threaten me on this turn, which is unlikely given its current position.\n\n# Decision\n\nRIGHT is the optimal move because:\n1. It's safe (no obstacles)\n2. It immediately collects the apple at (9, 0), increasing my score to 4 apples\n3. It moves me toward the edge of the board, which could be strategically useful\n4. It maintains distance from the enemy\n5. After eating this apple, I'll have 4 apples and need 46 more to win\n\n**Plan:** Move RIGHT to collect the (9, 0) apple. Next turn, I should move UP to get off the bottom row and head toward the cluster of apples at (3, 6), (2, 7), (3, 8), and (5, 7) while maintaining awareness of the enemy's movements.\n\nRIGHT",

This is the most strategic move to continue collecting apples and work toward winning the game.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move UP to (5, 2), then RIGHT to (6, 2), then UP to (6, 3) to collect that apple.
