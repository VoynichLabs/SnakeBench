Both moves also leave two safe follow-up options (e.g., moving UP from (9, 1) allows UP to (9, 2) or LEFT to (8, 1)).\n\n### Strategic Considerations:\nThe snake has no body, so the primary goal is to survive and grow. Moving **LEFT** brings the snake closer to the nearest apple (7, 2) and avoids the right edge, providing more flexibility. \n\n### Long-Term Plan:\nMove towards the apple at (7, 2) by first moving left, then continuing to adjust direction to close the distance.\n\nLEFT",

Moving RIGHT from (8,2) to (9,2) initiates a direct path toward (9,5) (next steps: (9,3) \u2192 (9,4) \u2192 (9,5)).  \n- **Future Options**: RIGHT keeps the snake in a straight line toward the apple, avoiding dead ends. Moving UP would require additional right moves, extending the path. DOWN moves away from apples, reducing growth potential.  \n- **Enemy Risk**: Enemy #1's current position (7,2) is to the left of the snake's head. Moving RIGHT or UP avoids direct conflict with Enemey #1's head, as their movement would not immediately overlap with these directions.  \n\n\n### Conclusion  \nRIGHT is the safest and most strategic move, as it avoids immediate death, moves toward the closest apple, and preserves future options.  \n\nRIGHT",
