This reduces my flexibility.\n* **UP** moves me away from the nearest apples and also blocks a downward move next turn, again limiting options.\n* **LEFT** places me at (2,6), bringing me directly into the region containing several apples (0,5), (1,5), (2,3) and (2,9). From (2,6) I will still have three viable follow\u2011up directions \u2013 UP, DOWN, and further LEFT \u2013 so I keep multiple safe paths open.\n\nTherefore, LEFT gives the best combination of proximity to reachable apples and preservation of future move options while staying completely safe this turn.\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to (2,6) to head toward the cluster of left\u2011side apples while retaining UP, DOWN, and additional LEFT as safe next moves.

I can then move LEFT to collect it, and later explore the lower\u2011left region for the apple at (2,3) while staying on the left side where I have more space and the opponent is far to the right.

The apple at (8, 2) is to the down and right, but moving DOWN would also start me toward it.\n3. The enemy is near the apples at (0, 5) and (2, 3), so they might go for those.\n\n**Potential Paths:**\n- If I move DOWN toward (6, 5), I can eat the apple at (7, 4) in a few moves.\n- If I move LEFT toward (5, 6), I can potentially reach the apple at (7, 4) but it's not as direct.\n- If I move UP toward (6, 7), I can potentially reach the apple at (2, 9) but it's further away.\n\n**Enemy Considerations:**\nThe enemy is at (1, 5) with a body at (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), and (3, 3). They might move toward the apples at (0, 5) or (2, 3), or they might move toward me if they see me as a threat.\n\n**Best Move:**\nMoving DOWN seems most strategic because:\n1. It allows me to move toward the apple at (7, 4).\n2. It keeps me away from immediate confrontation with the enemy.\n3. It maintains flexibility for future moves, as I can still change direction if needed.\n\nDOWN",

I'm at (8, 2) with a body extending to (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), and (7, 6).\n2. The enemy is at (2, 4) with a body extending to (2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6).\n3. The closest apples to me are at (7, 1) (directly below and to the left) and (9, 1) (to the right and down).\n4. The apple at (7, 1) is two cells away, and moving LEFT then DOWN would allow me to reach it.\n5. The apple at (9, 1) is two cells away, and moving RIGHT then DOWN would allow me to reach it.\n\n**Safe Moves Analysis:**\n- UP: (8, 3) - Safe, no obstacles.\n- DOWN: (8, 1) - Safe, no obstacles.\n- LEFT: (7, 2) - Unsafe, into my own body.\n- RIGHT: (9, 2) - Safe, no obstacles.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n1. The apple at (7, 1) is two cells away, and moving LEFT then DOWN would allow me to eat it.\n2. The apple at (9, 1) is two cells away, and moving RIGHT then DOWN would allow me to eat it.\n3. The enemy is far away and not an immediate threat.\n\n**Potential Paths:**\n- If I move UP toward (8, 3), I can potentially reach other apples but it's not as direct.\n- If I move DOWN toward (8, 1), I can potentially reach the apple at (9, 1) or (7, 1) in the next move.\n- If I move RIGHT toward (9, 2), I can potentially reach the apple at (9, 1) in the next move.\n\n**Enemy Considerations:**\nThe enemy is at (2, 4) with a body at (2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 6). They might move toward the apples at (2, 9), or they might move toward me if they see me as a threat.\n\n**Best Move:**\nMoving DOWN seems most strategic because:\n1. It allows me to move closer to the apples at (7, 1) and (9, 1).\n2. It keeps me away from immediate confrontation with the enemy.\n3. It maintains flexibility for future moves, as I can still change direction if needed.\n\nDOWN",
