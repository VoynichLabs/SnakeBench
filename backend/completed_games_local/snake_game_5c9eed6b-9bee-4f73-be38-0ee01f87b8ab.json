Enemy snake #0 head at (7, 9), no body.  \n\n**Possible moves from (5, 1):**  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 2) \u2014 safe? Empty board cell, no enemy body there.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 0) \u2014 safe? Within board, empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 1) \u2014 safe? Empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 1) \u2014 safe? Empty.  \n\nAll four moves are safe immediately (no adjacent snakes, no bodies anywhere yet).  \n\n**Apples reachable:**  \n- (6, 2) is closest \u2014 1 step down-right from my head? Actually from (5,1), (6,2) is 1 right + 1 up.  \nBut apples: (6, 2) is 1 step right + 1 step up from my head. To get there in 2 moves:  \nIf I go RIGHT now to (6,1), next turn could go UP to (6,2) if apple still there and safe.  \nIf I go UP now to (5,2), next turn could go RIGHT to (6,2).  \n\nAlso (3, 7) is far, (8, 7) and (8, 8) far, (6, 9) far.  \n\n**Enemy snake at (7, 9):**  \nFar away, not an immediate threat.  \n\n**Future safety:**  \nGoing UP to (5, 2) leaves me 3 free neighbor cells (except my tail at (5,1) behind me) next turn \u2014 good.  \nGoing RIGHT to (6, 1) also leaves 3 free neighbor cells next turn \u2014 good.  \nGoing DOWN to (5, 0) leaves only 3 free neighbor cells but one is out of bounds? Wait, (5,0)\u2019s neighbors: up (5,1) is my tail, left (4,0), right (6,0), down (5,-1) invalid. So actually only 2 safe moves next turn if I go down. That\u2019s worse.  \nGoing LEFT to (4, 1) similarly: neighbors next turn: up (4,2), down (4,0), right (5,1) is tail, left (3,1). So 3 safe moves actually \u2014 same as others except DOWN.  \n\nSo DOWN reduces options slightly.  \n\n**Closest apple priority:**  \n(6, 2) apple \u2014 to reach it fastest:  \nFrom (5,1), RIGHT then UP reaches it in 2 moves.  \nFrom (5,1), UP then RIGHT also 2 moves.  \nBut if enemy moves unpredictably, maybe better to stay central?  \n\nActually, enemy is far away, so no immediate collision risk.  \n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nWe have no body, so we can reverse direction safely? Wait \u2014 rule says moving directly backwards into your own body kills you, but we have no body except head, so moving backwards is into empty cell? Actually body list is empty, so tail is same as head? No, body is none means only head exists, so moving backwards would go into empty cell (where head was), which is safe because no body there. But after this move, we will have a body segment at (5,1), so next turn reversing into that cell would kill us.  \n\nGiven all safe moves, I\u2019ll pick one that goes toward nearest apple while keeping options open.  \n\n**Choice:** RIGHT to (6, 1) \u2014 puts me closer to apple at (6, 2) for next turn, and leaves good mobility.  \n\nPlan for next turn: Check if apple (6,2) still there, move UP if safe, else avoid enemy if it approaches.  \n\nRIGHT",

Length 1. Apples: 0.\nApples: (3, 7), (6, 2), (8, 8), (8, 7), (1, 6).\n\nMy last move was LEFT, which moved my head from (7, 9) to (6, 9) and ate an apple that was previously there (though the apples list now reflects the new distribution). My snake's new head is (6, 9), and the body is now (7, 9).\n\n**1. Determine Available Moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) and Immediate Safety:**\nCurrent Head: (6, 9)\n\n1. **UP**: (6, 9) -> (6, 10). Out of bounds (Y=10). **DEAD**.\n2. **DOWN**: (6, 9) -> (6, 8). Cell (6, 8) is empty. **SAFE**.\n3. **LEFT**: (6, 9) -> (5, 9). Cell (5, 9) is empty. **SAFE**.\n4. **RIGHT**: (6, 9) -> (7, 9). This cell is occupied by my body segment, which was the previous head location before the body shifted. Moving into (7, 9) means self-collision. **DEAD**. (Wait, the body segments are [(7, 9)]. The head is (6, 9). The current tail, if the snake grew, would be the old tail. Since I ate an apple, the old tail segment (7, 9) is still there. If I move RIGHT, I hit my own body. **DEAD**.)\n\n*Self-Correction on Body Collision Rule:* Since I ate an apple last turn, my length increased from 1 to 2. My body is now [(7, 9)]. Moving RIGHT attempts to move the head (6, 9) into (7, 9), which is my current body. This is a fatal collision.\n\nSafe Moves: DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\nA. **DOWN to (6, 8):**\n*   Safety: Safe.\n*   Goal proximity: Moves me towards the center of the board and possibly towards apples (8, 8) and (8, 7). From (6, 8), I would be 2 moves away from (8, 8) (R, D) or (1, 6) (L, L, L, D, D). The apple at (3, 7) is 3 moves away (L, L, D).\n\nB. **LEFT to (5, 9):**\n*   Safety: Safe.\n*   Goal proximity: Maintains the high Y position, moving away from most immediate apples except potentially (1, 6). From (5, 9), distance to (3, 7) is 3 moves (L, L, D, D). Distance to (1, 6) is 5 moves (L, L, L, D).\n\n**3. Analyze Apple Locations and Priorities:**\nApples are at: A1=(3, 7), A2=(6, 2), A3=(8, 8), A4=(8, 7), A5=(1, 6).\n\n*   My Current Head: (6, 9)\n*   Closest apples: A3 (8, 8) and A4 (8, 7).\n\n| Apple | Location | Distance from (6, 9) |\n|---|---|---|\n| A3 | (8, 8) | Manhattan distance: |2| + |-1| = 3. |\n| A4 | (8, 7) | Manhattan distance: |2| + |-2| = 4. |\n| A1 | (3, 7) | Manhattan distance: |-3| + |-2| = 5. |\n| A5 | (1, 6) | Manhattan distance: |-5| + |-3| = 8. |\n| A2 | (6, 2) | Manhattan distance: |0| + |-7| = 7. |\n\nTo reach (8, 8) quickly, I need to go Right and Down. Since RIGHT is blocked, I must move away from the apple initially to reposition.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 8):\nNew position (6, 8).\nNext turn options:\n*   UP: Back to (6, 9) - not good, but safe.\n*   DOWN: To (6, 7). Safe.\n*   LEFT: To (5, 8). Safe.\n*   RIGHT: To (7, 8). This is 1 step closer to (8, 8) and (8, 7). Safe.\nThis move opens up options for moving towards the right side of the board where A3 and A4 are located.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 9):\nNew position (5, 9).\nThis move is primarily lateral and keeps me on the edge. It makes reaching (8, 8) and (8, 7) take longer, but potentially sets me up for (3, 7) or (1, 6) later.\n\n**4. Consider Enemy Snake #1:**\nSnake #1 is at (6, 1). It is far away and does not pose an immediate threat, regardless of my move. (6, 1) is 8 units away.\n\n**5. Final Decision:**\nMoving DOWN seems strategically better as it pulls me off the top wall (Y=9) and puts me directly on a safe path towards the cluster of apples (8, 8) and (8, 7) via the right side, or towards (3, 7) via the middle. Since the closest apples are at (8, 8) and (8, 7), getting ready to move right/down is the better path.\n\nMove: DOWN.\nDOWN",

Determine Available Moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) and Immediate Safety:**\nCurrent Head: (6, 8)\n\n1. **UP**: (6, 8) -> (6, 9). This cell is occupied by my body segment. **DEAD**.\n2. **DOWN**: (6, 8) -> (6, 7). Cell (6, 7) is empty. **SAFE**.\n3. **LEFT**: (6, 8) -> (5, 8). Cell (5, 8) is empty. **SAFE**.\n4. **RIGHT**: (6, 8) -> (7, 8). Cell (7, 8) is empty. **SAFE**.\n\nSafe Moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Apple Proximity and Priorities:**\nCurrent Head: (6, 8).\n\nApples are at:\nA1=(3, 7) - Manhattan Distance: |-3| + |-1| = 4.\nA2=(8, 8) - Manhattan Distance: |2| + |0| = 2.\nA3=(8, 7) - Manhattan Distance: |2| + |-1| = 3.\nA4=(1, 6) - Manhattan Distance: |-5| + |-2| = 7.\nA5=(7, 1) - Manhattan Distance: |1| + |-7| = 8.\n\nThe closest apple is A2 at (8, 8), 2 steps away.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves towards A2 (8, 8):**\n\nA. **RIGHT to (7, 8):**\n*   Safety: Safe.\n*   Goal proximity: Moves me 1 step closer to (8, 8). New distance (7, 8) to (8, 8) is 1 (RIGHT). This puts me in a position to potentially eat A2 next turn.\n*   Next turn: If I move RIGHT, the head will be at (7, 8) and the body will shift (6, 8). The tail is (6, 9).\n\nB. **DOWN to (6, 7):**\n*   Safety: Safe.\n*   Goal proximity: Moves me away from (8, 8). New distance (6, 7) to (8, 8) is 3 (R, U, R or R, R, U). This move is poor for targeting A2.\n\nC. **LEFT to (5, 8):**\n*   Safety: Safe.\n*   Goal proximity: Moves me away from (8, 8) (distance 3: R, R, R) and closer to (3, 7) (distance 3: L, L, D). This might be a good alternative if the path to (8, 8) is blocked, but currently, it is not.\n\n**4. Consider Enemy Snake #1:**\nSnake #1 Head: (6, 2). Body: [(6, 1)].\nSnake #1 is far to the south. It is focused on the apple at (7, 1) or potentially (3, 7).\nIf Snake #1 moves UP, it will be at (6, 3).\nIf Snake #1 moves DOWN, it hits its body segment (6, 1) if it hasn't moved yet (although the tail is (6, 1), since it grew, the body is (6, 1) only if it ate an apple and grew to length 2). Wait, the body list is [(6, 1)]. Snake #1 length is 2. (6, 2) to (6, 1) hits its body. **DEAD for enemy if DOWN.**\nIf Snake #1 moves LEFT, it goes to (5, 2).\nIf Snake #1 moves RIGHT, it goes to (7, 2).\n\nGiven that I am aiming for (8, 8), which is on the far right edge, Snake #1's movements in the center/bottom are unlikely to interfere with me in Turn 2.\n\n**5. Determine the best move:**\nMoving RIGHT to (7, 8) is the most direct path to the closest apple (8, 8). If I move RIGHT, I can then move RIGHT again in Turn 3 to eat the apple at (8, 8), provided no one else gets there.\n\n**Head-on Collision Check for (8, 8):**\n* My approach: (6, 8) -> (7, 8) [T2] -> (8, 8) [T3, EAT]\n* Enemy Snake #1 (6, 2) is too far to reach (8, 8) in 2 turns (Min dist 8). No risk of collision for the apple.\n\n**Head-on Collision Check for (7, 8) - My chosen move:**\n* My Head: (6, 8) -> (7, 8).\n* Enemy Snake #1 (6, 2): The minimum distance from (6, 2) to (7, 8) is 7 steps (R, U, U, U, U, U, U). No risk.\n\nThe move RIGHT is safe and optimal for the current goal.\n\nRIGHT",

Accessible via LEFT * 5.\nA2=(1, 6): Distance 8.\nA5=(5, 4): Distance 6.\nA3=(3, 3): Distance 9.\n\nTargeting A4=(9, 5) seems optimal as it's the closest.\n\n**3.

Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (7, 7):** Moves 1 step *away* from A4 (new distance 4). Moves 1 step closer to A1 (3, 7) (new distance 4).\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN are viable for A4.\n\n**4. Check Opponent Threat and Collisions:**\nEnemy Snake #1 Head: (8, 1).\nEnemy #1 is 6 steps away from A4 (9, 5). (|9-8| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps L1 distance).\nEnemy #1 (8, 1) is 6 steps away from A1 (3, 7). (|3-8| + |7-1| = 5 + 6 = 11 steps).\n\nThe enemy is far away from the relevant apples. We have ample lead time.\n\n**5. Comparing RIGHT vs. DOWN (for A4 at (9, 5)):**\n\n*   **RIGHT (8, 7) -> (9, 7):** This keeps us along the x=9 axis. Next moves would be DOWN to (9, 6), then DOWN to (9, 5) to eat the apple. This path seems clear and simple.\n*   **DOWN (8, 7) -> (8, 6):** Next possible moves towards (9, 5) are RIGHT to (9, 6), then DOWN to (9, 5) OR DOWN to (8, 5) then RIGHT to (9, 5).\n\nBoth moves reach (9, 5) in two subsequent turns.\n\nThe move RIGHT to (9, 7) keeps us closer to the boundary, but avoids moving into the center of the board where movement could get complex later. Given the long vertical movement of the enemy, maintaining a high X coordinate might be advantageous for this apple. Also, the square (9, 7) is completely open.\n\nLet's choose **RIGHT** (9, 7).\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note for Turn 6 onwards:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (9, 7), the next target is A4 (9, 5). The optimal moves will be two DOWN moves (to (9, 6) then (9, 5)). After eating A4, the head will be (9, 5). Target A1 (3, 7) next, which requires moving LEFT and UP.

This is highly prioritized.\n*   **Move LEFT to (8, 6):** This moves us away from A4 (distance 1 vs 0).\n\n**4. Check for Immediate Head-to-Head Collision or Enemy Threat**\n\nEnemy Head: (8, 3).\nIf I move DOWN to (9, 5), the enemy is at (8, 3).\nThe opponent's closest apple is likely A3 (3, 3) (L1 distance 5) or A5 (5, 4) (L1 distance 6). To reach me at (9, 5) the enemy would need to move L1 distance 3, and they are currently positioned far away from (9, 5).\nIf the enemy is moving towards the right edge (e.g., UP to (8, 4) or RIGHT to (9, 3) if they aim high/right), a collision is highly unlikely with my move DOWN to (9, 5).\n\nSpecifically, if the enemy moves:\n1.  UP to (8, 4): New heads (9, 5) and (8, 4). No collision.\n2.  DOWN to (8, 2): New heads (9, 5) and (8, 2). Collision with my body? No, (8, 2) is a valid move for them, and my tail is (8, 8). No collision.\n3.  LEFT to (7, 3): New heads (9, 5) and (7, 3). No collision.\n4.  RIGHT to (9, 3): New heads (9, 5) and (9, 3). No collision.\n\nThe move DOWN to eat the apple at (9, 5) is safe and optimal.\n\n**5.

My snake length will be 5.\nThe remaining apples are A1=(3, 7), A2=(1, 6), A3=(3, 3), A5=(5, 4).\nClosest remaining apples:\nA5 (5, 4): L1 distance |9-5| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5.\nA1 (3, 7): L1 distance |9-3| + |5-7| = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nThe enemy at (8, 3) is closer to A3 (L1 5) and A5 (L1 6 if they move UP, L1 3 if they move towards A5 via LEFT/UP). I am actually closer to A5 at L1 5.\n\nFrom (9, 5), I primarily need to move LEFT and slightly UP towards (5, 4).\nNext turn (Turn 8), I should prioritize moving LEFT to (8, 5) or (7, 5).\n\nDOWN",

So enemy can go DOWN or LEFT.  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (9,5), it eats apple and grows by 1 segment (new head at apple, body extends). If enemy goes LEFT to (8,6), it stays same length.  \nNo immediate head-on collision risk with my possible moves, since my moves are (8,4), (7,3), (9,3) and enemy\u2019s are (9,5) or (8,6).  \n\n**Future mobility:**  \nFrom (8,4): safe next moves? Body after moving UP without eating: [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2)], tail (8,1) disappears.

UP and RIGHT head toward (9,5), but enemy may also head there this turn (if it goes DOWN). If enemy eats (9,5) this turn, it grows and occupies (9,5) next turn, making it dangerous to approach. Safer to avoid racing enemy directly unless necessary.\n\n**Enemy behavior prediction:**  \nEnemy likely goes DOWN to (9,5) to eat apple and grow, unless it sees risk (but none obvious). If it goes DOWN, next turn its head is at (9,5) with longer body. That could block my access to right-side apples temporarily.\n\n**Decision:**  \nLEFT to (7,3) avoids enemy area, moves toward left-side apples (3,3) and (5,4), and maintains good mobility (3 safe moves next turn). UP also good but slightly closer to enemy\u2019s potential new position. RIGHT is riskier due to fewer safe moves and potential enemy presence at (9,5) next turn.  \n\nLEFT seems safest while progressing toward apples.\n\n**Short-term plan:**  \nMove LEFT to (7,3). Next turn, consider moving toward (5,4) or (3,3) while monitoring enemy movement. Avoid getting trapped near left wall later.\n\nLEFT",

This improves the Y coordinate alignment but keeps the X coordinate maximized, meaning we are still far along the board edge.\n\nMoving LEFT (8, 5) sets us up better to continue moving LEFT/DOWN to reach (5, 4) in the fastest way while moving away from the dangerous right wall/corner.\n\n**4. Check for Immediate Head-to-Head Collision or Enemy Threat**\n\nEnemy Head: (7, 3).\nIf I move LEFT to (8, 5):\nThe enemy is at (7, 3).

(This hits their own body, (8, 3) is a body segment. **DEAD move for them**).\n\nIf they move UP to (7, 4), they are 1 step away from me at (8, 5). No collision.\nIf they move LEFT/DOWN, we are safe.\n\nSince the enemy cannot move RIGHT, the closest they can get to (8, 5) is (7, 4) or (6, 3). Moving LEFT seems safe regarding the opponent.\n\n**5. Final Decision and Long-Term Plan**\n\nMoving LEFT (to 8, 5) is the best choice as it systematically reduces the distance to the closest apple (A4 at 5, 4) and moves us off the dangerous boundary.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note for Turn 9 onwards:**\nHead will be at (8, 5).

This aligns us perfectly on the X-axis.\n*   **Move UP to (8, 6):** L1 distance to (5, 4) is |8-5| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5. Moves away from the target. Avoid if possible.\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT achieve the same minimum L1 distance (3) this turn.\n\n**4. Considering Enemy Interaction (Enemy Head: 7, 4)**\n\nEnemy safe moves:\n1.  UP to (7, 5).\n2.  DOWN to (7, 3). (Hits their own body segment (7, 3). **DEAD move**).\n3.  LEFT to (6, 4).\n4.  RIGHT to (8, 4).\n\nIf I move:\n*   **LEFT to (7, 5):** This is a direct head-to-head collision if Snake #1 moves UP to (7, 5). Both die. **This move is highly dangerous and must be avoided.**\n*   **DOWN to (8, 4):** This is a direct head-to-head collision if Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (8, 4). Both die. **This move is highly dangerous and must be avoided.**\n*   **UP to (8, 6):** Safe from immediate collision. Enemy moves UP (7, 5), LEFT (6, 4), or (unlikely) stays put.\n\n*Wait! Re-checking Enemy Snake #1 safe moves:*\nEnemy Head: (7, 4)\nEnemy Body: [(7, 3), (8, 3)]\n\n1. UP: (7, 5). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (7, 3). Hits its own body (7, 3). DEAD.\n3. LEFT: (6, 4). Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (8, 4). Safe.\n\nThe enemy has three safe moves: UP (7, 5), LEFT (6, 4), RIGHT (8, 4).\n\n**Scenario Analysis:**\n\nA. If I choose LEFT to (7, 5): Collision if Enemy chooses UP (7, 5). (1/3 risk of fatal collision, assuming equal likelihood).\nB. If I choose DOWN to (8, 4): Collision if Enemy chooses RIGHT (8, 4). (1/3 risk of fatal collision, assuming equal likelihood).\nC. If I choose UP to (8, 6): No immediate collision possible.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN take me closer to the overall goal (5, 4). However, both carry a high risk of a simultaneous head collision with Snake #1, who is currently very close (just NW of their head).\n\nIf Snake #1 targets A4 (5, 4), they are likely to head LEFT (6, 4) or RIGHT (8, 4) next turn. If they target A5 (3, 4) or A3 (3, 3), they will likely head LEFT or DOWN.\n\n*   If they move RIGHT to (8, 4), they are directly on the path to A4 (5, 4).\n*   If they move LEFT to (6, 4), they are also taking a strong path towards A4 (5, 4).\n*   If they move UP to (7, 5), they are moving toward A1 (3, 7) or A2 (1, 6) or A4 (5, 4), but blocking me from moving LEFT.\n\nGiven that the target A4 (5, 4) is critical, but the immediate moves to get there (LEFT and DOWN) lead to a 2/3 overall chance of a fatal collision (assuming 1/3 risk for UP and 1/3 risk for RIGHT by the enemy), it is prudent to pick the one move that is guaranteed non-fatal: UP.\n\nMoving UP to (8, 6) gains space and time for the opponent to clear the path, while also positioning my head closer to A1 (3, 7). After this move, A4 (5, 4) distance becomes 5. A1 (3, 7) distance becomes 5.\n\nThis temporary retreat/reposition is justified by the extreme risk posed by the adjacent enemy head.\n\n**5. Long-term Strategy Note for Turn 10 onwards:**\nHead will be at (8, 6). Targetting A4 (5, 4) is still primary, but A1 (3, 7) or A2 (1, 6) are now equally accessible. We must watch the path of Snake #1 closely. From (8, 6), we should aim to move LEFT (7, 6) and then DOWN/LEFT to re-engage the central apples, ideally A4 or A1.\n\nUP",

LEFT (7,5) moves toward (3,7) but less directly. I\u2019ll assume enemy may go DOWN toward apples, making RIGHT risky for head-on. UP also risky if enemy goes LEFT.\n\n**Decision:**  \nLEFT is safe, moves toward nearest apple, avoids head-on risk, and keeps good options next turn.\n\n**Short-term plan:**  \nMove LEFT to (6,4). Next turn, consider moving to (5,4) to eat apple if safe, while monitoring enemy position. Keep distance from enemy\u2019s longer body.\n\nLEFT",

Considering Enemy Interaction (Enemy Head: 6, 4)**\n\nEnemy Snake #1 is at (6, 4). Target A4 is (5, 4). The enemy is only 1 move horizontally and 0 moves vertically away from A4. The enemy is in prime position to take A4.\n\nEnemy safe moves from (6, 4):\nEnemy Body: [(7, 4), (7, 3)]\n1. UP: (6, 5). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (6, 3). Safe.\n3. LEFT: (5, 4). **APPLE A4!** (5, 4). If the enemy moves LEFT, they eat A4.\n4. RIGHT: (7, 4). Hits their own body (7, 4). **DEAD**.\n\nEnemy has three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. Moving LEFT wins the apple (A4). Since A4 is the closest apple available to the enemy, it is highly rational for them to take it. We must assume A4 will be gone this turn.\n\nIf A4 is taken by Enemy #1 (moves LEFT to 5, 4), its new head is (5, 4) and its body segments become [(6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3)].\n\n**5. Re-evaluating Targets after assuming A4 loss**\n\nIf A4 is eaten, the next best target is A1 (3, 7) or A5 (3, 4). Both are distance 7 (A1 is 6 originally, A5 is 7). Wait, A1 is distance 6 from my current position (8, 6).\n\n*   A1 (3, 7): Distance 6.\n*   A5 (3, 4): Distance 7.\n*   A2 (1, 6): Distance 7.\n\nTarget A1 (3, 7). We need to decrease X and increase Y.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (UP and LEFT) for A1 (3, 7):**\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (7, 6):** L1 distance to (3, 7) is |7-3| + |6-7| = 4 + 1 = 5. Moves closer.\n*   **Move UP to (8, 7):** L1 distance to (3, 7) is |8-3| + |7-7| = 5 + 0 = 5. Moves closer.\n\nBoth moves put us at distance 5 from A1 (3, 7).\n\n**Collision Check for T=10:**\n\nWe are at (8, 6). Enemy is at (6, 4).\n\n*   If I choose **LEFT (7, 6)**:\n    *   Enemy cannot move RIGHT to (7, 6) because RIGHT is a fatal move for them (hits their body at 7, 4).\n    *   No collision possible. (Enemy moves: 6, 5, 6, 3, or 5, 4).\n*   If I choose **UP (8, 7)**:\n    *   Enemy could maybe aim for (8, 7) in the future, but it's not immediately reachable.\n    *   No collision possible.\n\nBoth LEFT and UP are safe from the enemy.\n\n**Choosing the Best Move:**\n\nWe need to choose between moving LEFT towards the center of the board (7, 6) or UP along the right edge of the board (8, 7).\n\n*   (7, 6) is a very central and open position, allowing access to A1 (3, 7) via LEFT/UP or A5 (3, 4) via DOWN/LEFT. It maintains strong flexibility.\n*   (8, 7) is less flexible. From (8, 7), accessing A1 requires moving LEFT three times (7, 7), (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7) or moving up the perimeter and turning. Wait, from (8, 7) we only need to go LEFT 5 units to get A1 (3, 7).\n\nLet's look at coverage of remaining apples from the resulting positions:\n\n**A. Move LEFT to (7, 6):**\n*   A1 (3, 7): Dist 5 (L4, U1)\n*   A2 (1, 6): Dist 6 (L6)\n*   A3 (3, 3): Dist 7 (L4, D3)\n*   A5 (3, 4): Dist 6 (L4, D2)\n\n**B. Move UP to (8, 7):**\n*   A1 (3, 7): Dist 5 (L5)\n*   A2 (1, 6): Dist 7 (L7, D1)\n*   A3 (3, 3): Dist 8 (L5, D4)\n*   A5 (3, 4): Dist 7 (L5, D3)\n\nMoving LEFT (7, 6) provides slightly better overall access to the remaining apples on the board, particularly A2, A3, and A5, all of which are slightly further towards the bottom and left. It also pulls our snake head away from the existing clump of our body on the right edge (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), which is good for future maneuverability.\n\nWe were trying to break free from the right-side congestion caused by the UP move in the last turn. Moving LEFT continues that goal and sets up a robust path toward the cluster of apples on the left side.\n\nLEFT\n\n**Short-term strategy note for Turn 11 onwards:**\nHead will be at (7, 6). Assume A4 (5, 4) is gone. Primary target is A1 (3, 7) or A5 (3, 4). The next move should be LEFT (6, 6) or UP (7, 7) to approach A1. We should continue moving diagonally towards the remaining apple cluster (3, 7), (1, 6), (3, 3), (3, 4).\n\nLEFT",

Apples: 4.\nEnemy Snake #1 (ID 1): Head (5, 4). Length 4 (based on previous turn's movement assumption, which was correct: Enemy moved to (5, 4) and ate an apple). Body: [(6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3)]. Apples: 3.\n*Self-Correction/Verification: The previous turn (T=10) rationale correctly predicted that the enemy would move LEFT to (5, 4) and consume the apple at (5, 4). The current game state shows the enemy head at (5, 4) and 3 apples collected, confirming this.*\n\nApples remaining:\nA1 (3, 7): L1 distance |7-3| + |6-7| = 4 + 1 = 5.

Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head: 7, 6)**\n\nCoordinates occupied by my body: (8, 6), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6).\nCoordinates occupied by enemy: (5, 4) [Head], (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3) [Body].\n\n1.  **UP**: (7, 6) -> (7, 7).

Hits my body segment (8, 6). **DEAD**.\n\nSafe Moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves based on Target (A1 at 3, 7)**\n\nWe are at (7, 6) and want to get to (3, 7). We need to decrease X and increase Y.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 6):** L1 distance to (3, 7) is |6-3| + |6-7| = 3 + 1 = 4. Moves closer by 1.\n*   **Move UP to (7, 7):** L1 distance to (3, 7) is |7-3| + |7-7| = 4 + 0 = 4. Moves closer by 1.\n*   **Move DOWN to (7, 5):** L1 distance to (3, 7) is |7-3| + |5-7| = 4 + 2 = 6. Moves away by 1.\n\nThe best moves are LEFT and UP, both reducing the distance to 4.\n\n**4. Consider Enemy Interaction (Enemy Head: 5, 4)**\n\nEnemy #1 is at (5, 4). They are long and currently centered.\nEnemy body segments: (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3).\nEnemy goal is likely A4 (3, 4) or A3 (3, 3). A4 is distance 2 (L2, U0). A3 is distance 3 (L2, D1).\n\nEnemy Safe Moves from (5, 4):\n1. UP: (5, 5). Safe.\n2. DOWN: (5, 3). Safe.\n3. LEFT: (4, 4). Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (6, 4). Hits their body (6, 4). **DEAD**.\n\nEnemy will likely move LEFT to (4, 4) or possibly UP to (5, 5) to flank the apple cluster.\n\n**Collision Check for T=11:**\n\n*   **If I move LEFT to (6, 6):**\n    *   No direct path for the enemy to (6, 6). Enemy moves: (5, 5), (5, 3), (4, 4). Safe.\n*   **If I move UP to (7, 7):**\n    *   No direct path for the enemy to (7, 7). Safe.\n*   **If I move DOWN to (7, 5):**\n    *   No direct path for the enemy to (7, 5). Safe.\n\nAll safe moves are collision-free for this turn.\n\n**5. Choosing the Best Move (LEFT vs UP)**\n\nBoth LEFT (6, 6) and UP (7, 7) achieve distance 4 to A1 (3, 7).\n\nA1 (3, 7) access:\n*   From (7, 7) [via UP]: Requires 4 consecutive LEFT moves. This is rapid access but limits flexibility if something blocks the path at (6, 7) or (5, 7).\n*   From (6, 6) [via LEFT]: Requires 3 LEFT moves and 1 UP move (e.g., (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 7) or (6, 7), (5, 7), (4, 7), (3, 7)).\n\nMoving LEFT to (6, 6) is strategically superior:\n1.  **Flexibility:** (6, 6) provides immediate access:\n    *   To A1 (3, 7) via UP/LEFT moves.\n    *   To A2 (1, 6) via LEFT moves.\n    *   To A4 (3, 4) via LEFT/DOWN moves.\n2.  **Obstruction Avoidance:** Moving LEFT keeps us off the upper Y=7 row immediately, which might be where the enemy aims if they try to block us (they might move (5, 5) -> (5, 6) -> (4, 7) or similar). It allows us to approach the apple cluster (3, 7, 3, 4, 3, 3) laterally from the side rather than head-on from above.\n3.  **Body Management:** Moving steadily LEFT draws the snake's body away from the congested right side of the board centered around X=8, 9, which is critical for future maneuvering.\n\nI choose LEFT to (6, 6).\n\n**Short-term strategy note for Turn 12 onwards:**\nHead will be at (6, 6). Primary targets are A1 (3, 7) or A4 (3, 4). The next move should be aimed at maximizing leftward progress toward the cluster, likely LEFT again to (5, 6) or UP to (6, 7), depending on enemy positioning. Maintain flexible approach to the core apple group.\n\nLEFT",

Consider Enemy Interaction (Enemy Head: 4, 4)**\n\nEnemy #1 is at (4, 4). Enemy is likely targeting A4 (3, 4) (Distance 1: LEFT or DOWN).\nEnemy Safe Moves from (4, 4):\n1. UP (4, 5): Safe.\n2. DOWN (4, 3): Safe. Lays claim to A3 or moves towards A4.\n3. LEFT (3, 4): Safe. EATS A4 (3, 4).\n4. RIGHT (5, 4): Hits their body (5, 4). **DEAD**.\n\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (3, 4), they eat the apple. This is the most likely move. If they move DOWN to (4, 3), they miss A4 but get closer to A3.\n\n**Collision Check (Enemy at 4, 4):**\n\n*   My possible moves: (6, 7), (5, 6), (6, 5).\n*   Enemy possible moves: (4, 5), (4, 3), (3, 4).\n\nNo immediate head-on collisions, as we are separated by at least 1 unit in X and 2 units in Y.\n\n**5. Choosing the Best Move (UP vs LEFT)**\n\nA4 (3, 4) is likely to be consumed by the enemy. We should prioritize A1 (3, 7) or A2 (1, 6).\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (5, 6):**\n    *   Distance 3 to A1 (3, 7).\n    *   Distance 4 to A2 (1, 6).\n    *   Moves me closer to Y=6 line of apples (A2).\n    *   Creates space and flexibility by moving away from the center of the board.\n\n*   **Move UP to (6, 7):**\n    *   Distance 3 to A1 (3, 7).\n    *   Distance 6 to A2 (1, 6).\n    *   Positions me directly above the path the enemy might take if they move UP (e.g., (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7)).\n\nSince the enemy is highly likely to take A4 (3, 4) by moving LEFT, our focus shifts to A1 (3, 7). Both UP and LEFT are equally good for A1 this turn.\n\nHowever, moving LEFT to (5, 6) keeps the path to A2 (1, 6) quick (3 more LEFT moves). It also avoids getting too high near the wall, increasing future options for movement and potentially trapping the enemy if they continue towards the core (3, 4). If the enemy moves LEFT (3, 4), they will be short and confined to the lower left quadrant.\n\nLet's assume Enemy moves LEFT to (3, 4) and eats the apple.\nEnemy Head: (3, 4). Length 5. Body: (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 6):\nNext turn I am at (5, 6). A1 (3, 7) is distance 3. A2 (1, 6) is distance 4.\nI can move UP to (5, 7) or LEFT to (4, 6). Both keep good pressure on the apple cluster.\n\nIf I move UP to (6, 7):\nNext turn I am at (6, 7). A1 (3, 7) is distance 3.\nI must move LEFT to (5, 7).\n\nMoving LEFT seems marginally better for maintaining general lateral access to *both* A1 and A2, and maximizing movement away from the tail segments currently stuck on the right side.\n\nI choose LEFT.\n\n**Short-term strategy note for Turn 13 onwards:**\nHead will be at (5, 6). Enemy likely at (3, 4). Target A1 (3, 7) or A2 (1, 6). Move towards the open space at (4, 6) (LEFT) or UP to (5, 7) to start approaching A1. Prioritize A1 (3, 7) to keep the score lead.\n\nLEFT",

Apples: 4.\n*Note: My previous rationale predicted the enemy would eat the apple at (3, 4). The current state confirms the enemy head is at (3, 4) and their length increased by 1 (from 4 to 5).*\n\nApples remaining: (A = Apple)\nA1 (3, 7)\nA2 (1, 6)\nA3 (3, 3)\nA4 (9, 0)\nA5 (4, 0)\n\nL1 Distances from My Head (5, 6):\nA1 (3, 7): |5-3| + |6-7| = 2 + 1 = 3.

Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head: 5, 6)**\n\nMy body occupied: (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 5).\nEnemy occupied: (3, 4) [Head], (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4).\n\n1.  **UP (5, 7):** Safe. (Empty)\n2.  **DOWN (5, 5):** Safe. (Empty)\n3.  **LEFT (4, 6):** Safe. (Empty)\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 6):** Hits my body segment (6, 6). **DEAD**.\n\nSafe Moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves based on Target (A1 at 3, 7)**\n\nWe are at (5, 6) and A1 is at (3, 7) (Distance 3).\n\n*   **Move UP to (5, 7):** L1 distance to (3, 7) is |5-3| + |7-7| = 2 + 0 = 2. Moves closer by 1.\n*   **Move LEFT to (4, 6):** L1 distance to (3, 7) is |4-3| + |6-7| = 1 + 1 = 2. Moves closer by 1.\n*   **Move DOWN to (5, 5):** L1 distance to (3, 7) is |5-3| + |5-7| = 2 + 2 = 4. Moves away by 1.\n\nBest moves are UP and LEFT, both reducing distance to 2.\n\n**4. Consider Enemy Interaction (Enemy Head: 3, 4)**\n\nEnemy #1 is at (3, 4). They are likely targeting A1 (3, 7) (Distance 3), A3 (3, 3) (Distance 1), or A2 (1, 6) (Distance 6).\nGiven their position at X=3, they have a strong vertical alignment.\n\nEnemy Safe Moves from (3, 4):\n1. UP (3, 5): Safe. Moves closer to A1 (3, 7) (D=2).\n2. DOWN (3, 3): Safe. EATS A3 (3, 3).\n3. LEFT (2, 4): Safe.\n4. RIGHT (4, 4): Hits their body (4, 4). **DEAD**.\n\nPrediction of Enemy Move:\nThe enemy is extremely likely to move DOWN to (3, 3) and eat A3, as it is the closest apple (D=1).\n\n**5. Collision and Trap Analysis**\n\n*If I move UP to (5, 7):*\nNext moves: (4, 7) (towards A1). I maintain high ground and space.\n\n*If I move LEFT to (4, 6):*\nNext moves: (3, 6) (towards A1 or A2).\n\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (3, 3), we are safe from collision.\n\nIf the enemy surprises and moves UP to (3, 5):\n*   My position: (5, 7) or (4, 6).\n*   Enemy position: (3, 5).\nNo immediate collision. My path to A1 (3, 7) is still clear if I move UP then LEFT. The enemy path is also clear if they continue UP.\n\nLet's compare UP vs LEFT for maximum future utility and apple capture speed toward A1 (3, 7).\n\n*   **Move UP to (5, 7):** The next logical step is LEFT to (4, 7), then LEFT to (3, 7) to eat A1. Total 2 moves.\n*   **Move LEFT to (4, 6):** The next logical step is UP to (4, 7), then LEFT to (3, 7) to eat A1. Or UP to (4, 7), then UP to (4, 8), then LEFT to (3, 8), DOWN to (3, 7). That's too long. The direct path is (4, 6) -> (4, 7) -> (3, 7). Total 2 moves.\n\nBoth paths lead to A1 in 2 turns.\n\nHowever, moving LEFT to (4, 6) keeps me close to the Y=6 line, which is close to A2 (1, 6) if the path to A1 gets contested or complicated. (4, 6) is a very central and open cell.\n\nMoving UP to (5, 7) puts me higher, which might be helpful if I need to move around the enemy's vertical travel path (since they are moving on X=3). If the enemy moves UP to (3, 5), they will continue UP (3, 6), (3, 7). If I move UP now, I can potentially reach (4, 7) before they reach (3, 6), allowing me to eat A1 at (3, 7).\n\nScenario: Enemy moves UP (3, 5).\n1. Me: (5, 7). Enemy: (3, 5).\n2. Me moves LEFT: (4, 7). Enemy moves UP: (3, 6).\n3. Me moves LEFT: (3, 7) [EAT A1]. Enemy moves UP: (3, 7) [Head-on Collision!]. **DANGER!**\n\nIf I move (5, 7) -> (4, 7) -> (3, 7), that takes 2 turns.\nIf Enemy moves (3, 4) -> (3, 5) -> (3, 6) -> (3, 7), that takes 3 turns.\n\nWait, my turn calculation for the enemy (3 turns) is wrong if they are moving vertically.\n(3, 4) -> (3, 5) [T13] -> (3, 6) [T14] -> (3, 7) [T15, EAT A1].\n\nMy move:\n(5, 6) -> (5, 7) [T13]\n(5, 7) -> (4, 7) [T14]\n(4, 7) -> (3, 7) [T15, EAT A1].\n\nIf the enemy decides to contest A1 (3, 7) by moving UP, we will reach it on the same turn (T15), leading to a crucial head-to-head collision. Since we are equal in score (4-4), I must avoid this high-risk scenario.\n\nWe must assume the enemy plays optimally and goes for A3 (3, 3) since it grants an immediate apple and is safer.\n\nHowever, given the possibility of aggressive play:\nIf I choose LEFT to (4, 6) at T13:\n1. Me: (4, 6). Enemy: (3, 5) (worst case).\n2. Me moves UP: (4, 7). Enemy moves UP: (3, 6).\n3. Me moves LEFT: (3, 7) [EAT A1]. Enemy moves UP: (3, 7) [Collision!].\n\nThe timing calculation holds. If I move UP or LEFT, I will reach A1 at T15, as will the enemy if they choose the fastest path (vertical UP). Since I cannot guarantee the enemy won't go vertical, and drawing/dying here is undesirable, I should choose a move that provides maximum divergence from their X column (X=3).\n\nMoving LEFT to (4, 6) puts me on the X=4 column.\nMoving UP to (5, 7) puts me on the X=5 column.\n\nMoving UP to (5, 7) gives me more horizontal space between me and the enemy X=3 column. If I observe the enemy moving UP to (3, 5) on T13, I can adjust my T14 move to avoid the collision, perhaps by orbiting higher (5, 8).\n\nLet's stick with the fastest path that allows for reaction time, assuming A3 (3, 3) is eaten.\n\nIf A3 is eaten by the Enemy (most likely):\nEnemy Head: (3, 3). Length 6. Tail at (4, 4) [tail moved from (7, 4)].\n\nMy goal is still A1 (3, 7).\nMove UP to (5, 7): Dist 2 to A1.\nMove LEFT to (4, 6): Dist 2 to A1.\n\nMoving Up (5, 7) gives me better alignment for a 90-degree turn: (5, 7) -> (4, 7) -> (3, 7).\nMoving Left (4, 6) requires (4, 6) -> (4, 7) -> (3, 7).\n\nSince both moves are equally distance efficient, I select the move that keeps me most flexible near the cluster of apples (A1, A2).\n\n(5, 7) seems slightly better because it prepares for the immediate approach to A1 (3, 7) by gaining elevation, and still allows a quick move LEFT towards A2 (1, 6) if necessary in the future.\n\n**Long-term strategy note for Turn 14 onwards:**\nAssuming Enemy eats A3 (3, 3) and moves to X=3, Y=3. My Head (5, 7). Target A1 (3, 7). Next move should be LEFT (4, 7). If I eat A1, I then need to focus on A2 (1, 6) or retreat/maneuver. I need to be aware of the enemy's length (6) which fills up the central vertical area around X=3.\n\nUP",

(Head is (3, 3)).\n\n1. **UP (5, 8):** Safe. (Empty)\n2. **DOWN (5, 6):** Hits my body segment (5, 6). **DEAD**.\n3. **LEFT (4, 7):** Safe. (Empty)\n4. **RIGHT (6, 7):** Safe. (Empty)\n\nSafe Moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves based on Target (A1 at 3, 7)**\n\nWe are at (5, 7) and A1 is at (3, 7) (Distance 2). We want to move to (4, 7) next.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (4, 7):** L1 distance to (3, 7) is |4-3| + |7-7| = 1. Reduces distance by 1. Direct path.\n*   **Move UP to (5, 8):** L1 distance to (3, 7) is |5-3| + |8-7| = 2 + 1 = 3. Moves away by 1.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (6, 7):** L1 distance to (3, 7) is |6-3| + |7-7| = 3 + 0 = 3. Moves away by 1.\n\nThe clear best move is LEFT to (4, 7).\n\n**4. Consider Enemy Interaction (Enemy Head: 3, 3; Target A1 at 3, 7)**\n\nEnemy #1 is at (3, 3). Their current distance to A1 (3, 7) is |3-3| + |3-7| = 4.\nTheir path to A1 is UP, UP, UP, UP. It requires 4 moves.\n\nEnemy Safe Moves from (3, 3):\n1. **UP (3, 4):** Hits their body segment (3, 4). **DEAD**. (They just ate, so their body segment is still (3, 4)).\n2. DOWN (3, 2): Safe.\n3. LEFT (2, 3): Safe.\n4. RIGHT (4, 3): Safe.\n\nThe enemy MUST avoid moving UP this turn, or they self-destruct. This is critical. They are stuck underneath their own body pillar.\n\nIf they move DOWN to (3, 2), their distance to A1 (3, 7) increases to 5.\nIf they move LEFT to (2, 3) or RIGHT to (4, 3), they begin maneuvering around their body.\n\nSince the enemy cannot directly challenge A1 (3, 7) this turn, and they cannot even move UP, I have a clear advantage to capture A1.\n\n**5. Final Decision Calculation**\n\n1. Move LEFT to (4, 7).\n2. T15: Move LEFT to (3, 7) and eat A1.\n\nThis secures the apple, ties the score (5-5), and increases my length. The move LEFT is perfectly safe from self-collision and enemy collision.\n\n**6. Long-term strategy note for Turn 15 onwards:**\nAfter eating A1 (3, 7) on T15, I will be at (3, 7) with length 6. The next closest apples are A2 (1, 6) and A5 (2, 4). The enemy is currently stuck near (3, 3) because they cannot go UP. They will likely try to wrap around to reach the apples on the left, or perhaps go for the distant apples on Y=0. After eating A1, I should pivot towards A2 (1, 6) to keep score pressure on the cramped enemy.\n\nLEFT",

(This is the cell I moved from two turns ago, and it's now my neck).\n\nSafe Moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves based on Target (A1 at 3, 7)**\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (3, 7):** Gathers Apple A1. Score becomes 5. Length increases to 6. This is the optimal move.\n*   **Move UP to (4, 8):** Distance to A1 increases to 2. Moves away from all currently close apples.\n*   **Move DOWN to (4, 6):** Distance to A1 increases to 2.\n\nThe move LEFT is clearly the best and necessary to maintain score parity.\n\n**4. Consider Enemy Interaction (Enemy Head: 2, 3; Target A1 at 3, 7)**\n\nEnemy #1 is at (2, 3). Their current L1 distance to A1 (3, 7) is |2-3| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5.\nThey are too far away to contest A1 (3, 7).\n\nEnemy Safe Moves from (2, 3):\n1. UP (2, 4): Apple A5 is here. If they move UP, they eat A5. This is highly likely.\n2. DOWN (2, 2): Safe.\n3. LEFT (1, 3): Safe.\n4. RIGHT (3, 3): Hits their body segment (3, 3). **DEAD**.\n\nThe enemy's most likely move is UP to (2, 4) to grab Apple A5. This move is safe and increases their score to 6.\n\n**5. Collision Check (My move LEFT vs Enemy moves)**\n\n*   My new head position: (3, 7) (Apple)\n*   If Enemy moves UP: New head (2, 4) (Apple)\n*   If Enemy moves DOWN: New head (2, 2)\n*   If Enemy moves LEFT: New head (1, 3)\n\nNo collisions are possible between my snake and the enemy snake this turn, regardless of the enemy's move.\n\n**6.

Enemy Head (2, 4), Score 6.\nGoal: Target A2 (1, 6). L1 distance from (3, 7) is |3-1| + |7-6| = 3.\nThe enemy is now positioned near the center-left. Their distance to A2 (1, 6) from (2, 4) is |2-1| + |4-6| = 3.\nIt will be a race for A2. The safest path for me is generally DOWN then LEFT: (3, 7) -> (3, 6) -> (2, 6) -> (1, 6).

(I moved LEFT from (4, 7) to (3, 7) and ate an apple).\nEnemy Snake #1 (ID 1): Head (2, 4). Length 7. Body: [(2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)]. Apples: 6. (Enemy moved UP from (2, 3) to (2, 4) and ate an apple).\n\nApples remaining (A):\nA1 (1, 6)\nA2 (9, 0)\nA3 (4, 0)\nA4 (8, 7)\nA5 (1, 5)\n\nScores: Me: 5, Enemy: 6. Enemy is winning by 1 apple.\n\nState from previous analysis: It is a race for A1 (1, 6).\n\nL1 Distances from My Head (3, 7):\nA1 (1, 6): |3-1| + |7-6| = 2 + 1 = 3.\nA4 (8, 7): |3-8| + |7-7| = 5. (Easy horizontal access, but far from other apples.)\nA5 (1, 5): |3-1| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 = 4. (Close to A1)\nA3 (4, 0): |3-4| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8.\nA2 (9, 0): |3-9| + |7-0| = 6 + 7 = 13.\n\nL1 Distances from Enemy Head (2, 4):\nA1 (1, 6): |2-1| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3.\nA5 (1, 5): |2-1| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2.\nA4 (8, 7): |2-8| + |4-7| = 6 + 3 = 9.\nA3 (4, 0): |2-4| + |4-0| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n\nEnemy is slightly closer (L1=2) to A5 (1, 5) and tied (L1=3) for A1 (1, 6).\nSince A5 (1, 5) is closer to the enemy, and strategically leads to A1 (1, 6), the enemy might prioritize A5.\n\nMy primary goal: Capture A1 (1, 6) or A5 (1, 5) quickly, or A4 (8, 7) as a fallback if the left side is contested severely.\n\n**2. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head: 3, 7)**\n\nMy body occupied: (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6). (Tail is (7, 6)).\nEnemy occupied: (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4). (Head is (2, 4)).\n\n1. **UP (3, 8):** Safe. (Empty)\n2. **DOWN (3, 6):** Safe. (Empty. This moves me towards A1 (1, 6) and A5 (1, 5)).\n3. **LEFT (2, 7):** Safe. (Empty. This moves me towards A1 (1, 6) and A5 (1, 5)).\n4. **RIGHT (4, 7):** Hits my body segment (4, 7). **DEAD**. (This is my neck).\n\nSafe Moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves based on Targets (A1 at 1, 6 and A5 at 1, 5)**\n\nMy head is at (3, 7).\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (3, 6):** Path towards the cluster A1/A5: (3, 7) -> (3, 6) -> (2, 6) -> (1, 6) [A1]. Or (3, 6) -> (2, 6) -> (2, 5) -> (1, 5) [A5]. Total 3 moves to (1, 6) or 4 moves to (1, 5).\n*   **Move LEFT to (2, 7):** Path towards the cluster A1/A5: (3, 7) -> (2, 7) -> (1, 7) -> (1, 6) [A1]. Or (2, 7) -> (2, 6) -> (1, 6) [A1], or (2, 7) -> (1, 7) -> (1, 6) [A1]. This move feels slightly less direct for immediate targeting of (1, 6) as I might have to maneuver around the edge.\n    *   (2, 7) -> (2, 6) -> (1, 6). 3 moves total to A1.\n    *   (2, 7) -> (1, 7) -> (1, 6). 3 moves total to A1.\n*   **Move UP to (3, 8):** Moves away from the targets A1/A5. Distance to A1 increases to 4. Good positioning for A4 (8, 7) later, but not useful now.\n\nBoth DOWN (3, 6) and LEFT (2, 7) put me 2 moves from A1 (1, 6) and 3 moves from A5 (1, 5). (Assuming the snake can make two subsequent efficient moves).\n\nLet's check the enemy's potential moves from (2, 4).\nEnemy Body: (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4). Neck is (2, 3).\n1. UP (2, 5): Safe. Good move towards A5 (1, 5) and A1 (1, 6).\n2. DOWN (2, 3): Hits body segment (2, 3). **DEAD**.\n3. LEFT (1, 4): Safe. Good move towards A5 (1, 5).\n4. RIGHT (3, 4): Hits body segment (3, 4). **DEAD**.\n\nEnemy's safe moves are UP (2, 5) and LEFT (1, 4). They are highly likely to go to (1, 4) or (2, 5).\n\n*   If Enemy moves LEFT (1, 4): They are 1 move from A5 (1, 5). They will likely secure A5 next turn (T17).\n*   If Enemy moves UP (2, 5): They are 1 move from A5 (1, 5). They will likely secure A5 next turn (T17).\n\nSince the enemy is highly likely to take A5 next turn, I must focus on securing A1 (1, 6) and doing it in a way that minimizes collision risk.\n\n**Focus on A1 (1, 6):**\nIf I move **DOWN (3, 6)**:\nT17: I am at (3, 6). Path to A1: (2, 6) (LEFT) or (3, 5) (DOWN)\nIf Enemy moves UP (2, 5):\nT17: Enemy is at (2, 5). Path to A5: (1, 5) (LEFT). Path to A1: (2, 6) (UP)\nIf Enemy moves LEFT (1, 4):\nT17: Enemy is at (1, 4). Path to A5: (1, 5) (UP). Path to A1: (1, 6) (UP)\n\nIf the enemy goes LEFT to (1, 4), they can take A1 (1, 6) in two turns (T17: UP to (1, 5) [A5], T18: UP to (1, 6) [A1]).\nIf the enemy goes UP to (2, 5), they can take A5 in T17 (LEFT to (1, 5) [A5]). Then T18 UP to (1, 6) [A1].\n\nI need to block the enemy's access to A1 (1, 6) or secure it first.\n\nIf I move **LEFT (2, 7)**: This position is high up.\nT17: I am at (2, 7).\nPath to A1: (2, 6) (DOWN).\nIf Enemy moves UP (2, 5): They are below me. My move DOWN to (2, 6) could set up a conflict if they move UP to (2, 6) as well!\nIf Enemy moves LEFT (1, 4): No immediate conflict.\n\nIf I move **DOWN (3, 6)**:\nT17: I am at (3, 6).\nPath to A1: (2, 6) (LEFT).\nIf Enemy moves UP (2, 5): They are at (2, 5). They are highly likely to move LEFT to (1, 5) (A5). If I move LEFT to (2, 6), there is no head-on collision.\n\nIf I choose to go LEFT, I will reach (2, 7). Then if I go DOWN (2, 6) and then LEFT (1, 6), I get A1 in 3 turns.\nIf I choose to go DOWN, I will reach (3, 6). Then if I go LEFT (2, 6) and then LEFT (1, 6), I get A1 in 3 turns. (Or DOWN (3, 5) then LEFT, but that's less direct.)\n\nLet's prioritize the most aggressive move towards A1 (1, 6) that avoids immediate head-on collisions. The cell (2, 6) is key for the next turn.\n\nScenario A: I move LEFT (2, 7).\nEnemy Tries to get A5:\n1. Enemy moves UP (2, 5). My move is safe.\n2. Enemy moves LEFT (1, 4). My move is safe.\n\nScenario B: I move DOWN (3, 6).\nEnemy Tries to get A5:\n1. Enemy moves UP (2, 5). My move is safe.\n2. Enemy moves LEFT (1, 4). My move is safe.\n\nThe move DOWN (3, 6) seems slightly more efficient in keeping options open for moving towards (1, 6) or (1, 5) in a straight line, reducing turns required for coordinate changes.\n\nIf I move DOWN (3, 6) and the enemy moves UP (2, 5) to grab A5 next turn:\nT17: Me (3, 6). Enemy (2, 5).\nT18: I move LEFT to (2, 6). Enemy moves LEFT to (1, 5) (Eats A5).\nT19: I move LEFT to (1, 6) (Eats A1). Enemy moves UP to (1, 6) (Head-on collision!)\n\nWAIT! If the enemy takes A5 at (1, 5) on T18, their head is at (1, 5). Their body extends back to (2, 5), then (2, 4), etc.\nIf I move (2, 6) on T18, I am above them. They move UP to (1, 6) on T19, and I move LEFT to (1, 6) on T19. That's a simultaneous head-on collision for A1!\n\nWe need to avoid that collision or get there one turn ahead.\n\nIf I move DOWN (3, 6) now:\nT17: (3, 6).\nTo get A1 (1, 6) in 2 moves: T18 LEFT (2, 6), T19 LEFT (1, 6).\n\nIf Enemy moves LEFT (1, 4) now:\nT17: (1, 4).\nTo get A1 (1, 6) in 2 moves: T18 UP (1, 5) [A5], T19 UP (1, 6) [A1].\n\nIf I move DOWN (3, 6) and enemy moves LEFT (1, 4), we collide at T19.\n\nIf I move LEFT (2, 7) now:\nT17: (2, 7).\nTo get A1 (1, 6) in 2 moves: T18 DOWN (2, 6), T19 LEFT (1, 6).\n\nIf Enemy moves LEFT (1, 4) now:\nT17: (1, 4).\nTo get A1 (1, 6) in 2 moves: T18 UP (1, 5) [A5], T19 UP (1, 6) [A1].\n\nStill a T19 collision likelihood if the enemy chooses the LEFT path to A5/A1.\n\nWhat if the enemy chooses the UP path? (2, 5).\nIf Enemy moves UP (2, 5) now:\nT17: (2, 5).\nTo get A1 (1, 6): T18 LEFT (1, 5) [A5], T19 UP (1, 6) [A1].\n\nIf I move LEFT (2, 7) now:\nT17: (2, 7).\nTo get A1 (1, 6): T18 DOWN (2, 6), T19 LEFT (1, 6).\nThis avoids collision: On T18, I am at (2, 6), Enemy at (1, 5) (Eats A5). We are safe.\nOn T19, I move LEFT to (1, 6) (Eats A1). Enemy moves UP to (1, 6) (Head-on collision!)\n\nThe critical point is that both optimal paths (mine and enemy's) involve reaching A1 (1, 6) simultaneously on T19. To break the tie, I need to force them into a longer path or take a different apple.\n\nI need to choose a move that prepares me for A4 (8, 7) if A1/A5 race is too risky, or one that positions me defensively.\n\nA4 (8, 7) is 5 moves away (3, 7) -> (4, 7) X -> (4, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (8, 8) -> (8, 7). Wait, I cannot go to (4, 7).\nPath to A4 (8, 7) is (3, 7) -> UP (3, 8) -> RIGHT (4, 8) -> ... (8, 8) -> DOWN (8, 7). That's 6 moves.\n\nLet's stick to the race for the left side for now, as it's the closest cluster.\n\nIf I move UP (3, 8): I abandon the A1/A5 race. Me: 6 moves to A1. Enemy: 3 moves to A1. They win easily this way.\n\nI must take a move that gets me to the left side. Both LEFT (2, 7) and DOWN (3, 6) are 3 moves to A1, and are safe from collision this turn.\n\nLet's pick **LEFT (2, 7)**. This puts me directly above the enemy's current x-coordinate (x=2) and opens a path for next turn (2, 7) -> (2, 6).\n\nIf I move LEFT (2, 7):\nEnemy highly likely moves UP (2, 5) to secure A5.\nT17: Me (2, 7). Enemy (2, 5).\nIf I move DOWN (2, 6) on T17, and Enemy moves LEFT (1, 5) [A5] on T17.\nT18: Me (2, 6). Enemy (1, 5). Enemy eats A5.\nT19: I move LEFT (1, 6) [A1]. Length 7 -> 8. Enemy moves UP (1, 6) [A1].\nStill a collision risk!\n\nWhat if, after moving LEFT to (2, 7), I deviate to block?\nT17: Me (2, 7). Enemy likely (2, 5) or (1, 4).\nIf E moves (1, 4): T17: I go DOWN (2, 6). E at (1, 4). T18: I go LEFT (1, 6) [A1]? No, wait, if I go (2, 6), next turn I can go LEFT to (1, 6). But E can go UP (1, 5) [A5] and then UP (1, 6) [A1]. Still a collision.\n\nIf I move to (2, 7) this turn, and the enemy goes to (1, 4).\nT17: Me (2, 7). E (1, 4).\nT18: I go DOWN (2, 6). E goes UP to (1, 5) [A5].\nT19: I go LEFT (1, 6) [A1]. E goes UP to (1, 6) [A1]. Collision.\n\nIf the enemy goes UP to (2, 5) this turn.\nT17: Me (2, 7). E (2, 5).\nT18: I go DOWN (2, 6). E goes LEFT to (1, 5) [A5].\nT19: I go LEFT (1, 6) [A1]. E goes UP to (1, 6) [A1]. Collision.\n\nSince a collision seems unavoidable if both snakes go for the closest apples optimally, I should choose the move that sets me up best for the alternatives.\n\nOption A: LEFT (2, 7). This keeps the threat on the left and maintains the short path.\nOption B: DOWN (3, 6). Similar path efficiency, slightly further away from the wall.\n\nLet's review the possibility of trapping the enemy or forcing them onto a less desirable path. The enemy's head is at (2, 4) and their body is dense below (y=3, 4).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (3, 6), I block the easy access to the area right of the enemy from the top.\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 7), I am vertically above the enemy's position (2, 4), and my body is still high (4, 7), (5, 7).\n\nGiven the enemy already controls the bottom portion of the middle, I want to use my superior vertical position. Moving LEFT (2, 7) is a strong aggressive move that puts pressure on the enemy's vertical space.\n\nIf the enemy sees me move LEFT to (2, 7), they might be discouraged from moving UP to (2, 5), as that sets up a severe block possibility at (2, 6).\n\nIf E moves LEFT (1, 4). No blocking achieved. Collision risk confirmed.\nIf E moves UP (2, 5).\nT17: Me (2, 7). E (2, 5).\nIf I move DOWN (2, 6) next turn, I block E from moving to (2, 6).\nE then must go LEFT (1, 5) [A5] or UP (2, 7) [My neck, which kills E]. E must go LEFT (1, 5).\nT18: Me (2, 6). E (1, 5) [A5].\nT19: I move LEFT (1, 6) [A1]. E moves UP (1, 6) [A1]. Still a collision.\n\nSince I cannot get there before the enemy if they choose the optimal path, I should try to move towards the third closest apple, A4 (8, 7), if the direct path is a guaranteed shared death.\n\nRevised Target: A4 (8, 7). Distance: 5 moves (L1).\nPath from (3, 7): UP (3, 8) -> RIGHT (4, 8) -> RIGHT (5, 8) -> RIGHT (6, 8) -> RIGHT (7, 8) -> DOWN (7, 7) or (8, 7). This is long and exposes me.\n\nWait, my coordinates show 0 at (3, 7) and A at (8, 7). This distance is 5.\n(3, 7) -> (4, 7) [DEAD]\n(3, 7) -> (3, 8) -> (4, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (8, 8) -> (8, 7) (7 moves)\n\nLet's check the enemy's path to A4 (8, 7): From (2, 4) -> (8, 7). L1 = 9. They are much slower.\n\nIf I concede A1 and A5 to the enemy, and focus on A4 (8, 7), I guarantee survival and get an apple, while the enemy potentially collides or gets trapped grabbing two adjacent apples.\n\nMove UP (3, 8):\nT17: (3, 8). New distance to A4 (8, 7) is 5 + 1 = 6 Manhattan distance. But now I can move RIGHT freely.\nT18: (4, 8).\nT19: (5, 8).\nT20: (6, 8).\nT21: (7, 8).\nT22: (8, 8).\nT23: (8, 7) [A4].\n\nIf I go LEFT (2, 7):\nT17: (2, 7). Collision risk on T19. If I survive:\nIf I then decide to go for A4: (2, 7) -> (3, 7) [DEAD] -> (3, 8) -> (4, 8) ...\n\nThe safest and guaranteed long-term scoring move is UP, moving towards A4 (8, 7), conceding the highly dangerous contested apples A1 and A5. This prevents a probable T19 head-on collision.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note for Turn 17 onwards:**\nWe are conceding A1 (1, 6) and A5 (1, 5) to the enemy to avoid a likely head-on collision at A1 on T19. The enemy will lead 8-5. Our focus is A4 (8, 7).\nT17: Move to (3, 8).\nT18-T23: Move towards (8, 7) along the top edge. We must ensure the path (4, 7) is not blocked by our neck as we turn after (3, 7) and climb up. (4, 7) is currently our neck, so we cannot move there on T17.\nStart T17 from (3, 7).\nMove UP (3, 8). Path: (3, 8) -> (4, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (8, 8) -> (8, 7) [A4]. Total 7 moves.\n\nUP",

Body: [(2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4)]. Apples: 6. (Previous move: UP from (2, 4) to (2, 5). They ate an apple).\n\nApples remaining (A):\nA1 (1, 6)\nA2 (9, 0)\nA3 (4, 0)\nA4 (8, 7)\nA5 (1, 5)\n\nScores: Me: 5, Enemy: 6. Enemy is winning by 1 apple.\nMy previous move (UP to (3, 8)) was chosen to avoid a simultaneous head-on collision at A1 (1, 6) and pivot towards A4 (8, 7). This move conceded A1 and A5 to the enemy.\n\n**2. Evaluate Immediate Targets and Enemy Position**\n\nCurrent My Head (3, 8).\nCurrent Enemy Head (2, 5).\n\nL1 Distances from My Head (3, 8):\nA4 (8, 7): |3-8| + |8-7| = 5 + 1 = 6. (Primary target)\nA1 (1, 6): |3-1| + |8-6| = 2 + 2 = 4. (Still close, but contested)\nA5 (1, 5): |3-1| + |8-5| = 2 + 3 = 5. (Contested)\nA3 (4, 0): |3-4| + |8-0| = 1 + 8 = 9.\nA2 (9, 0): |3-9| + |8-0| = 6 + 8 = 14.\n\nL1 Distances from Enemy Head (2, 5):\nA5 (1, 5): |2-1| + |5-5| = 1. (Enemy is 1 move away from A5)\nA1 (1, 6): |2-1| + |5-6| = 2. (Enemy is 2 moves away from A1)\nA4 (8, 7): |2-8| + |5-7| = 6 + 2 = 8.\nA3 (4, 0): 7.\n\nPrediction: Enemy will move towards A5 (1, 5) and eat it this turn (T17). Likely move: LEFT (1, 5).\n\n**3. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head: 3, 8)**\n\nMy body occupied: (3, 7) (neck), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6).\nEnemy occupied: (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4). (Head is (2, 5)).\n\n1. **UP (3, 9):** Safe. (Empty) - Moves towards A4 (8, 7) aggressively along the top wall.\n2. **DOWN (3, 7):** Hits my neck (3, 7). **DEAD**.\n3. **LEFT (2, 8):** Safe. (Empty) - Moves back towards the contested cluster.\n4. **RIGHT (4, 8):** Safe. (Empty) - Excellent move towards A4 (8, 7).\n\nSafe Moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**4. Evaluate Safe Moves based on Strategy (Target A4 (8, 7))**\n\nWe are following the long-term plan to secure A4 (8, 7) (L1=6).\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (4, 8):** This is the direct path towards A4 (8, 7) along the top edge while maintaining high maneuvering space.\n    *   Path: (4, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (8, 8) -> (8, 7) [A4]. 6 moves remaining. (T18-T23).\n*   **Move UP (3, 9):** Also good, keeping open space. Leads to (4, 9) -> (5, 9) -> ... (9, 9) -> (9, 8) -> (8, 8) -> (8, 7). Slightly longer/more constrained than moving along Y=8.\n*   **Move LEFT (2, 8):** This moves me closer to the contested zone (A1/A5). While A1 (1, 6) is only L1=4 away, the enemy is likely to take A5 now and A1 next turn. If the enemy takes A5 at (1, 5), they will then push UP to (1, 6) (A1). If I am at (2, 8) and move towards A1, I risk crossing the enemy's path or getting cornered.\n\nGiven the strategic decision to prioritize A4 and avoid conflict, **RIGHT (4, 8)** is the optimal move.\n\n**5. Check for Collision Risk with RIGHT (4, 8)**\n\nMe at (3, 8) -> (4, 8).\nEnemy is at (2, 5).\nIf Enemy moves LEFT (1, 5) to eat A5 (very likely), their new head is (1, 5). No collision risk.\nIf Enemy moves UP (2, 6) towards A1, their new head is (2, 6). No collision risk.\n\nThe move RIGHT is safe and aligns perfectly with the goal of securing A4 (8, 7) over the next few turns.\n\n**Long-term Plan Update:**\nWe are committed to the path for A4.\nT17: RIGHT to (4, 8).\nT18: RIGHT to (5, 8).\nT19: RIGHT to (6, 8).\nT20: RIGHT to (7, 8).\nT21: RIGHT to (8, 8).\nT22: DOWN to (8, 7) [A4].\nThis assumes no intervention, meaning 6 moves required until we eat. The enemy is currently expected to score 2 apples during this time, bringing the score to 5 vs 8. We need to catch up afterward.\n\nRIGHT",

Body: [(2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4)] \u2192 length 7 (head + 6 body segments).  \n\n**Apples:** (1, 6), (9, 0), (4, 0), (8, 7), (1, 5).  \n\n**Enemy snake #0:** Head at (3, 8), body: [(3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6)] length 6.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Possible moves from (2, 5):**  \n- **UP** \u2192 (2, 6) \u2013 empty on board (no apple).  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2, 4) \u2013 my own body segment \u2192 immediate death.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1, 5) \u2013 apple present, no snake body there currently.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3, 5) \u2013 empty, no snake body there currently.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Check for immediate death:**  \n**UP (2, 6):**  \n- On board? Yes.  \n- Into my body? No, my body cells: (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4), (5, 4).  \n- Into enemy body? Enemy body: (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (6, 6). (2, 6) not in that list.  \n- Enemy head collision? Enemy head currently at (3, 8). If enemy moves into (2, 6), that\u2019s possible but depends on enemy move. Let\u2019s check: Enemy can move UP (3, 9), DOWN (3, 7) into its own body, LEFT (2, 8), RIGHT (4, 8). So enemy could move LEFT to (2, 8), not (2, 6). Enemy can\u2019t reach (2, 6) in one move from (3, 8). So no head-on collision possible here.  \n- Safe? Yes.  \n\n**LEFT (1, 5):**  \n- On board? Yes.  \n- Into my body? No.  \n- Into enemy body? No.  \n- Enemy head collision? Enemy at (3, 8) cannot move to (1, 5) in one move (needs 2 moves horizontally). So safe from head-on.  \n- Apple at (1, 5): if I eat, I grow instantly at end of turn, but movement is safe.  \n\n**RIGHT (3, 5):**  \n- On board? Yes.  \n- Into my body? No.  \n- Into enemy body? No.  \n- Enemy head collision? Enemy at (3, 8) can move DOWN to (3, 7) (its own body), LEFT (2, 8), RIGHT (4, 8), UP (3, 9). So enemy cannot be at (3, 5) next turn. Safe from head-on.  \n\n**DOWN (2, 4):**  \n- My own body \u2192 immediate death \u2192 eliminated.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Which is best?**  \n\n**LEFT (1, 5):**  \n- Gets apple immediately.  \n- After eating, my length becomes 8. New tail remains where it is (since growth adds segment at head\u2019s old position after move).  \n- Possible downside: moving to (1, 5) might reduce future options because board edges are near (x=0 left of this), and my body will occupy (2, 5) after move (new segment).  \n- Next moves from (1, 5): possible UP (1, 6) apple, DOWN (1, 4) empty, LEFT (0, 5) board edge, RIGHT (2, 5) my body (dead). So 2 safe moves next turn unless apple at (1, 6) is eaten by someone else.  \n\n**UP (2, 6):**  \n- No apple.  \n- Next moves from (2, 6): UP (2, 7), DOWN (2, 5) my old head position now occupied by new body segment if no apple eaten? Wait: if I don\u2019t eat apple, my tail moves forward, so (2, 5) becomes empty. Actually correction: movement mechanics:  \nIf no apple eaten: head moves to (2, 6), body follows: new body[0] = (2, 5), body[1] = (2, 4), \u2026, last body cell (old tail) vacated. So (2, 5) will be my neck next turn, so moving DOWN into (2, 5) would be suicide. So from (2, 6) next turn: UP (2, 7), LEFT (1, 6) apple possibly, RIGHT (3, 6) empty. DOWN is into own body. So 3 safe moves next turn if no apple eaten now.  \n\n**RIGHT (3, 5):**  \n- No apple.  \n- Next moves from (3, 5): UP (3, 6), DOWN (3, 4) empty?, LEFT (2, 5) my neck next turn (unsafe), RIGHT (4, 5) empty. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Risk of enemy moves:**  \nEnemy at (3, 8) could go for apple at (1, 6) possibly via LEFT then DOWN etc. If I go LEFT to (1, 5), enemy might move toward (1, 6) next turn but not collide with me.  \n\nActually enemy\u2019s possible moves: from (3, 8):  \n- UP (3, 9) safe.  \n- DOWN (3, 7) its own body \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT (2, 8) safe.  \n- RIGHT (4, 8) safe.  \n\nSo enemy won\u2019t die unless it chooses DOWN. Likely will avoid that.  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (2, 8), then next turn it could go DOWN to (2, 7) etc. Not an immediate threat to my (1, 5) next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nI have 6 apples, enemy has 5. Eating apple extends lead. Safest apple reachable now is at (1, 5). It\u2019s not contested this turn because enemy is far.  \n\nGoing LEFT gets apple and leads toward apple at (1, 6) next turn if I go UP afterward. That\u2019s good for scoring.  \n\nGoing UP or RIGHT gives no apple now but maybe safer future options. However, with multiple apples, scoring faster helps win condition (50 apples).  \n\nGiven enemy is length 6, I\u2019m length 7, eating apple makes me length 8, harder for enemy to kill me by head-on collision unless they\u2019re equal length and we meet.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nLEFT gets apple safely and extends lead. No immediate collision risk. Good for future path toward (1, 6).  \n\nPlan: After eating (1, 5), strongly consider UP to (1, 6) next turn for another apple if enemy not threatening it.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nLEFT",

New body segment added at old head (1, 5).  \n- Next turn from (1, 6): possible moves: UP (1, 7), DOWN (1, 5) my new body (dead), LEFT (0, 6) edge, RIGHT (2, 6) empty. So 2 safe moves next turn (UP, RIGHT).  \n\n**DOWN (1, 4):**  \n- No apple.  \n- Next turn from (1, 4): UP (1, 5) my body (dead), DOWN (1, 3) empty, LEFT (0, 4) edge, RIGHT (2, 4) my body (dead). So only DOWN and LEFT safe next turn (2 safe moves).  \n\n**LEFT (0, 5):**  \n- No apple.  \n- Next turn from (0, 5): UP (0, 6) edge, DOWN (0, 4) edge, LEFT off board (dead), RIGHT (1, 5) my body (dead). So only UP and DOWN safe, but both along edge, very limited.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk assessment:**  \nEnemy at (4, 8) cannot threaten me directly this turn.  \nIf I go UP and eat apple, enemy might move toward center, but I\u2019ll be longer and can maneuver toward other apples later.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP gets apple safely, increases lead, avoids immediate danger. Even though it reduces next-turn safe moves to 2, that\u2019s acceptable because I\u2019ll be longer and can plan route toward (8, 7) or (4, 0) afterward.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 6), likely UP to (1, 7) or RIGHT to (2, 6) depending on enemy position. Try to loop around toward center/apples while avoiding dead ends.  \n\nUP",

The enemy is likely to pursue A1 (1, 2).\n\nGiven that A4 (8, 7) and A5 (7, 6) are 4 moves away, and A4 is further from the enemy (8 vs 6), sticking to the plan for A4 (8, 7) remains the safest path to securing an apple without contest.\n\n**3.

Check for Collision Risk with RIGHT (6, 8)**\n\nMe at (5, 8) -> (6, 8).\nEnemy is at (1, 6).\nThe enemy is expected to move toward (1, 2).

Enemy at (5, 8) can move UP (5, 9), DOWN (5, 7) its own body (dead), LEFT (4, 8) its own body (dead), RIGHT (6, 8) empty. So enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, RIGHT. Neither reaches (1, 7) in one move. Safe.  \n\n**LEFT (0, 6):**  \n- On board: yes (edge).  \n- Into my body: no.  \n- Into enemy body: no.  \n- Enemy cannot reach (0, 6) in one move.

UP or RIGHT keeps more central options.  \n\nBetween UP and RIGHT:  \n- UP to (1, 7) puts me closer to apple (8, 7) eventually, but also closer to top edge.  \n- RIGHT to (2, 6) moves toward center, giving slightly more flexibility next turn.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose **RIGHT** to stay in more open space and avoid the left-edge trap.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 6), likely go UP toward (2, 7) to approach (7, 6) or (8, 7) area while avoiding enemy at (5, 8).

If the enemy goes for A5, a collision is unlikely as we approach from opposite sides of the board.\n\nI will continue the plan toward A4 (8, 7).\n\n**3. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head: 6, 8)**\n\nMy body occupied: (5, 8) (neck), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (4, 7).\nEnemy occupied: (1, 6) (neck), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 4). (Head is (2, 6)).\n\n1. **UP (6, 9):** Safe. (Empty)\n2. **DOWN (6, 7):** Safe. (Empty, but close to enemy activity area)\n3. **LEFT (5, 8):** Hits my neck (5, 8). **DEAD**.\n4. **RIGHT (7, 8):** Safe. (Empty)\n\nSafe Moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**4. Evaluate Safe Moves based on Strategy (Target A4 (8, 7))**\n\nWe are at (6, 8). We want to reach (8, 7).\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (7, 8):** Optimal move for the planned trajectory (T21: RIGHT (8, 8), T22: DOWN (8, 7)). 3 turns to apple.\n*   **Move DOWN (6, 7):** Leads to A4 (8, 7) via (6, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (8, 7). 3 turns total. Also possible path: (6, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (8, 7). Wait, this is 3 moves: (6, 7) -> (7, 7) [RIGHT] -> (8, 7) [RIGHT]. No, that doesn't work. (6, 7) -> (7, 7) [RIGHT] -> (8, 7) [RIGHT] means no apple. Path: (6, 7) -> (7, 7) [RIGHT] -> (8, 7) [RIGHT] is illegal if (8, 7) is the apple A4.\n    *   If DOWN: (6, 7) [T20] -> (7, 7) [T21, RIGHT] -> (8, 7) [T22, RIGHT]. This misses the apple.\n    *   To hit A4 (8, 7) from (6, 7), the path is usually: (6, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (8, 7) or (6, 7) -> (6, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (8, 8) -> (8, 7).\n\nThe planned path RIGHT (7, 8) is simplest and most direct to establish position for A4 (8, 7).\n\n**5. Check for Collision Risk with RIGHT (7, 8)**\n\nMe at (6, 8) -> (7, 8).\nEnemy is at (2, 6).\nEnemy safe moves: UP (2, 7), DOWN (2, 5) [hits body], LEFT (1, 6) [hits neck]. Enemy might crash if they only see UP as safe.\nWait, let's recheck the enemy body: (1, 6), (1, 5), (2, 5).\nEnemy Head (2, 6).\n1. UP (2, 7): Safe.\n2. DOWN (2, 5): Hit body (2, 5). DEAD.\n3. LEFT (1, 6): Hit body (1, 6). DEAD.\n4. RIGHT (3, 6): Safe.\n\nEnemy safe moves: UP (2, 7), RIGHT (3, 6).\n\nIf Enemy moves UP (2, 7) or RIGHT (3, 6), it is far away from my move to (7, 8). No immediate head-on collision risk or path blockage.\n\nThe move RIGHT is safe and optimal for the current goal (A4 at 8, 7).\n\n**Long-term Plan Update:**\nContinuing the path for A4 (8, 7). Estimated consumption T22.\nT20: RIGHT to (7, 8). **(Executing this turn)**\nT21: RIGHT to (8, 8).\nT22: DOWN to (8, 7) [A4].\nAfter securing A4, the remaining closest apple is A5 (7, 6). If we eat A4, A5 will be 2 moves away ((8, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (7, 6)). We will re-evaluate based on the enemy position at T22.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nCommitment to A4 (8, 7) continues. Estimated consumption T22.\nT21: RIGHT to (8, 8).\nT22: DOWN to (8, 7) [A4].\nAfter consumption, the immediate next target will be A5 (7, 6), two moves away, if the enemy has not taken it.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

So enemy\u2019s possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \nCould enemy reach (2, 7) in one move? No, too far. Safe.  \n\n**RIGHT (3, 6):**  \n- On board: yes.  \n- My body: no.  \n- Enemy body: no.  \n- Enemy cannot reach (3, 6) in one move. Safe.  \n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future options after each move:**  \n\n**UP to (2, 7):**  \nNext turn from (2, 7):  \n- UP (2, 8) empty.  \n- DOWN (2, 6) my body (dead).  \n- LEFT (1, 7) empty.  \n- RIGHT (3, 7) empty (enemy body at (3, 7) now? Wait, check: enemy body at (3, 7) currently, but enemy moves this turn too. If enemy moves away from (3, 7), it could be empty next turn; but if enemy stays, could be body. Safer to assume enemy may move unpredictably, so (3, 7) might be free).  \nLet\u2019s assume worst case: (3, 7) could be enemy body if enemy moves there. But also could be free.  \n\nActually, enemy\u2019s possible moves: from (6, 8) to (6, 9), (6, 7), or (7, 8). None put enemy body at (3, 7) next turn because enemy\u2019s tail follows. Current enemy body: (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (4, 7). After enemy moves, tail (4, 7) may vanish if no apple eaten. Did enemy eat apple last turn? Unknown. But enemy length is 6, same as last turn? Wait, last turn enemy length was 6, now still 6. So no apple eaten, so tail disappears. So new enemy body: head new pos + old body except last segment. So (3, 7) will be in enemy body only if enemy moves to (3, 7) or stays overlapping? Let\u2019s check: old body includes (3, 7), but tail is (4, 7). After move, tail disappears, so (3, 7) remains in enemy body unless enemy head moves to (3, 7)?? Wait, that\u2019s wrong: The body list shifts: new body = [new head] + old body[:-1]. Old body = [(5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (4, 7)]. Remove last segment (4, 7). So new body will contain (3, 7) as 4th segment. So yes, (3, 7) will be enemy body next turn regardless of where enemy head moves (unless enemy eats apple, but length unchanged so no apple). So (3, 7) is unsafe next turn.  \n\nThus from (2, 7), safe next moves: UP (2, 8), LEFT (1, 7). Two options.  \n\n**RIGHT to (3, 6):**  \nNext turn from (3, 6):  \n- UP (3, 7) enemy body (dead).  \n- DOWN (3, 5) empty.  \n- LEFT (2, 6) my body (dead).  \n- RIGHT (4, 6) empty.  \nSo safe next moves: DOWN, RIGHT. Two options.  \n\nBoth give 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple: (7, 6) distance |3-7|+|6-6|=4 from (3, 6) if I go RIGHT.  \nFrom (2, 7), closest apple: (8, 7) distance |2-8|+|7-7|=6, (7, 6) distance |2-7|+|7-6|=6.  \nSo RIGHT gets me closer to (7, 6) fastest.  \n\nAlso (1, 2) is far south, ignore for now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Avoid enemy head collision risk:**  \nEnemy at (6, 8) likely moving UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. From my (3, 6), enemy not adjacent, so safe.  \nFrom (2, 7), still safe.  \n\nBut going RIGHT toward (7, 6) apple might put me on path to compete with enemy later, but enemy is far (y=8 vs y=6).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Space and future flexibility:**  \nFrom (3, 6), I can go DOWN to (3, 5) toward center or RIGHT to (4, 6) toward apple.  \nFrom (2, 7), I\u2019m near top edge (y=7), limiting UP soon.  \n\nGiven my body blocks LEFT and DOWN from current head, going RIGHT opens more central options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nGo RIGHT now to (3, 6), then next turn likely DOWN to (3, 5) to avoid enemy body at (3, 7) and stay flexible, then loop toward (4, 0) or (1, 2) apples while keeping distance from enemy.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

(Note: My tail used to be at (3, 7) last turn, but my new tail is (3, 8) and (3, 7) is free). Wait, my body is [(6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), **(3, 7)**]. The last segment is (3, 7). Since I moved from (6, 8) -> (7, 8), the tail (3, 7) is freed up IF the body was 6. But my body is 7 segments long. Let's list my body precisely: (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7).

Body: [(6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7)]. Total length is 1 (Head) + 5 (Body segments) = 6.\nSince I did not eat an apple on T20, the tail segment (4, 7) from T19 must have been freed, and the new tail is (3, 7). Yes, (3, 7) is the tail, and it will be freed up this turn.\n\nLet's re-verify Enemy safe moves at (3, 6):\nEnemy body: (2, 6), (1, 6), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4).\n1. UP (3, 7): My current tail segment is (3, 7). Since I (Snake 0) *will* move this turn (7, 8) -> (8, 8), my previous tail (3, 7) **is freed**. This move is Safe for Snake 1.\n2. DOWN (3, 5): Safe.\n3. LEFT (2, 6): Hits neck (2, 6). DEAD.\n4. RIGHT (4, 6): Safe.\n\nEnemy safe moves: UP (3, 7), DOWN (3, 5), RIGHT (4, 6).\n\nIf Enemy moves UP (3, 7) or RIGHT (4, 6), they are moving toward the right side of the board, potentially aiming for A5 (7, 6) or A3 (8, 7).\nIf Enemy moves UP (3, 7), L1 distance to A5 (7, 6) becomes 3 moves (via (3, 7) -> (4, 7) -> (5, 7) -> (7, 6)). Wait, (3, 7) -> (4, 7) -> (5, 7) -> (6, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (7, 6). No, L1 from (3, 7) is |3-7| + |7-6| = 4 + 1 = 5.\nIf Enemy moves RIGHT (4, 6), L1 distance to A5 (7, 6) becomes 3 moves. |4-7| + |6-6| = 3.\n\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT (4, 6), they will be 3 moves away from A5 (7, 6).\nIf I move RIGHT (8, 8), I am 2 moves away from A3 (8, 7) and 3 moves away from A5 (7, 6).\n\nIf I move RIGHT (8, 8), I secure A3 (8, 7) on T22. The enemy cannot reach it before T27. No collision risk.\n\nIf the enemy aims for A5 (7, 6) and moves RIGHT (4, 6):\nT21: E1 (4, 6). Me (8, 8).\nT22: E1 (5, 6) or (4, 5).

Me (7, 6) [A5 consumed].\n\nIf both target A5, the minimum path for E1 is 3 moves (4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (7, 6) - Wait, that's 3 moves to (7, 6) from (4, 6): (4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (7, 6). That is 3 subsequent RIGHT moves. Wait, that's 4 moves. L1 is 3. (4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (7, 6). That's 3 moves.\n(4, 6) -> (5, 6) [T22]. (5, 6) -> (6, 6) [T23]. (6, 6) -> (7, 6) [T24].

Consumption T24.\n\nIf the enemy pursues A5 aggressively (e.g., moves RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT), we will both hit A5 on T24. This is a head-on collision, unless the enemy chooses another direction at some point.\n\nStrategy: Take A3 (8, 7) uncontested first, then evaluate the risk for A5 (7, 6).

If E1 has not moved far into my quadrant, secure A5 (7, 6) via (7, 7), (7, 6) [A5 consumption T24]. This will lead to a score of 7 vs 8, closing the gap.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy is 5 moves away from A3 (8, 7).\n3. The enemy is 3 moves away from A5 (7, 6). If I secure A3, I will then be (8, 7). My distance to A5 (7, 6) will be 1 + 1 = 2 moves from (8, 7).\nIf the enemy successfully aims for A5, they could reach it on T25 (4, 6) -> (5, 6) [T23] -> (6, 6) [T24] -> (7, 6) [T25]? No, L1 is 3. (4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (6, 6) -> (7, 6). Three moves. Consumption T25.\nWait, let's re-calculate L1=3 path: (4, 6) to (7, 6). T23: (5, 6). T24: (6, 6). T25: (7, 6). Yes, consumption T25.\n\nIf I take A3 now (T22), I will be at (8, 7).\nT23: Move to (7, 7) (1 move).\nT24: Move to (7, 6) (A5 consumption).\nI reach A5 one turn before the enemy. This is a very strong outcome: 2 apples in 3 turns, closing the gap from 3 apples deficit to 1 apple deficit.\n\nThe strategic move is clear: move DOWN to capture A3.\n\n**3.

(Empty)\n2. **DOWN (8, 7):** Contains apple A3. Safe. (Apple located)\n3. **LEFT (7, 8):** Hits my neck (7, 8). **DEAD**.\n4. **RIGHT (9, 8):** Safe. (Empty)\n\nSafe Moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**4. Evaluate Safe Moves based on Strategy (Target A3 (8, 7))**\n\nGoal: Consume A3 (8, 7) this turn.\nMove DOWN (8, 7) is the only move that achieves this.\n\n**5. Check for Head-on Collision and Constraint Risks**\n\nMy chosen move: DOWN to (8, 7).\n\nEnemy Head (4, 6). Enemy safe moves:\nFrom (4, 6), E1 can move to:\n1. UP (4, 7): Safe. (Empty)\n2. DOWN (4, 5): Safe. (Empty)\n3. LEFT (3, 6): Hits neck. **DEAD**.\n4. RIGHT (5, 6): Safe. (Empty)\n\nThe enemy is far away from (8, 7). No head-on collision risk with my planned move. My move is safe and guarantees an apple consumption.\n\n**Long-term Plan Update:**\nT22: DOWN to (8, 7) [A3 consumed]. Score 6 vs 8. My new length is 8.\nT23: Target A5 (7, 6). Move LEFT to (7, 7).\nT24: Move DOWN to (7, 6) [A5 consumed]. Score 7 vs 8. My new length is 9.\nIf the enemy attempts to intercept A5, they would be moving towards (7, 6). The enemy must use 3 turns minimum to reach A5, starting from (4, 6).\nT23: E1 max reach (5, 6).\nT24: E1 max reach (6, 6).\nT25: E1 max reach (7, 6) [A5 consumption].\nMy predicted sequence secures A5 one turn earlier (T24). This plan is sound.\nIf the enemy moves to the left side (towards A4 (1, 2)), I can reconsider going for A1 (9, 0) or A2 (4, 0). But for now, A5 is the priority.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",

Check possible moves from (4,6):**\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (4,7): empty on board (checking grid: row 7 col 4 is '.'), not own body, not enemy body? Enemy body is at (7,8),(6,8),(5,8),(4,8),(3,8) \u2014 (4,7) not in those. Safe unless enemy moves there simultaneously (we\u2019ll check later).  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (4,5): own body? Body list: (3,6),(2,6),(1,6),(1,5),(2,5),(2,4),(2,3),(3,3). (4,5) not listed. Enemy body? No. In bounds. Safe unless enemy head moves there.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (3,6): own body? Yes \u2014 first body segment after head is (3,6). Would die. Not allowed.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (5,6): empty? Board shows (5,6) is '.' (row 6 col 5). Not own body, not enemy body. Safe unless enemy moves there.  \n\nSo immediately lethal moves: LEFT into own body. Others are *potentially* safe.\n\n---\n\n**2. Check simultaneous collisions with enemy snake head:**\n\nEnemy head (8,8). Possible moves from (8,8):  \n- UP to (8,9): empty.  \n- DOWN to (8,7): apple there \u2014 if enemy goes there, they eat apple, grow next turn.  \n- LEFT to (7,8): own body segment? Enemy body: (7,8) is first body segment after head, so LEFT is suicide for them (into own body), so they won\u2019t choose LEFT.  \n- RIGHT to (9,8): empty.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \nTheir dangerous move: LEFT (into own body).\n\n---\n\n**3. Check head-on collisions:**\n\nWe check if any of our safe moves lands on a cell enemy might move into this turn.\n\nOur safe moves: UP (4,7), DOWN (4,5), RIGHT (5,6).\n\nEnemy\u2019s safe moves: UP (8,9), DOWN (8,7), RIGHT (9,8).\n\nNo overlap: enemy\u2019s destinations are (8,9),(8,7),(9,8). Ours are (4,7),(4,5),(5,6). No direct overlap \u2192 no head-on collision possible this turn.\n\n---\n\n**4. Choose among UP, DOWN, RIGHT:**\n\n- **UP** (4,7): gets closer to apple (8,7) and (7,6)? Actually (7,6) is closer in x distance but same y? Let\u2019s check distances:  \n  From (4,6) to (7,6): dist 3 right, 0 vertical.  \n  From (4,6) to (8,7): dist 4 right, 1 up.  \n  From (4,6) to (1,2): far.  \n  From (4,6) to (4,0): far down.  \n  From (4,6) to (9,0): far.  \n\n  Closest apple by Manhattan distance: (7,6) = 3, (8,7) = 5, others larger.  \n  UP to (4,7) \u2192 distance to (7,6) = 3 still, to (8,7) = 4.  \n  DOWN to (4,5) \u2192 farther from most apples except (4,0) maybe.  \n  RIGHT to (5,6) \u2192 distance to (7,6) = 2.  \n\n  So RIGHT gets us closest to nearest apple (7,6).\n\n- **Future options:**  \n  RIGHT to (5,6): from there, possible moves: UP (5,7), DOWN (5,5), LEFT (4,6) (occupied by our old head? Wait, after move, body shifts: head now (5,6), body now includes old head (4,6) as first segment, so (4,6) is body next turn, so LEFT back to (4,6) would be suicide next turn), RIGHT (6,6). So from (5,6), safe moves next turn would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT \u2014 3 options.  \n\n  UP to (4,7): from there, moves: UP (4,8) \u2014 enemy body there? Yes, (4,8) is enemy body (segment of snake 0), so UP next turn would be lethal into enemy body unless enemy moves away. DOWN (4,6) \u2014 occupied by our own body next turn, lethal. LEFT (3,7) \u2014 free? Possibly. RIGHT (5,7) \u2014 free. So from (4,7), safe moves next turn: LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 only 2 options, less flexible.  \n\n  DOWN to (4,5): from there, moves: UP back to (4,6) (body next turn, lethal), DOWN (4,4) free, LEFT (3,5) free, RIGHT (5,5) free. So safe moves next turn: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 3 options.  \n\nSo UP (4,7) has fewer future safe moves because UP is blocked by enemy body, DOWN blocked by own body.\n\n---\n\n**5. Avoid risky area near enemy:**\n\nEnemy at (8,8), moving possibly DOWN to (8,7) apple. If we go RIGHT toward (7,6), we might get close to enemy path soon, but not this turn. Still okay.\n\n---\n\n**6. Strategy note for next turn:**\n\nIf we go RIGHT now to (5,6), next turn we can go RIGHT again to (6,6) toward apple (7,6), but must check enemy movement. Enemy might go DOWN to (8,7) apple, then next turn enemy head at (8,7) with longer body, possibly moving left toward (7,7) etc. We\u2019ll be at (6,6) \u2192 (7,6) apple one step away, but enemy could also want that apple from (8,7) \u2192 (7,7) then (7,6) later. Might race for apple (7,6). But we\u2019re closer.\n\n---\n\n**7. Final choice:**\n\nRIGHT maximizes immediate progress toward nearest apple (7,6), keeps 3 safe moves next turn, avoids reducing options like UP does.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5,6), consider moving RIGHT toward apple (7,6) if safe, but check enemy head position and possible collisions. Keep path open to retreat downward if needed.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Consumption T25.\nEnemy: (5, 6) -> (6, 6) [1] -> (7, 6) [2]. Consumption T25.\n\nThis looks like a potential head-on collision at T25, or a block. I need to be careful with the approach.\n\nMy Current Options to start:\n1. Move LEFT to (7, 7). This puts me 1 L1 step from A4.\n2. Move DOWN to (8, 6). This puts me 2 L1 steps from A4.\n\nEnemy Current Safe Options from (5, 6):\nThe enemy is currently boxed in slightly by their body segments (4, 6) and (3, 6).\nSafe moves: UP (5, 7), DOWN (5, 5), RIGHT (6, 6).\n* If E1 moves RIGHT to (6, 6). They are 1 L1 step from A4.\n* If E1 moves UP to (5, 7). They are 3 L1 steps from A4.\n* If E1 moves DOWN to (5, 5). They are 3 L1 steps from A4.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 7) (My preferred move):\nT23: My Head (7, 7). E1 potential Head (6, 6).\nT24: I move DOWN to (7, 6) [Consumption].\nT24: E1 moves possibly RIGHT to (7, 6) [Consumption].\n\nIf E1 moves RIGHT to (6, 6) on T23, and I move LEFT to (7, 7) on T23:\nT24 potential outcomes:\n1. I move DOWN to (7, 6). E1 moves RIGHT to (7, 6). -> Head-on collision at (7, 6). **Both DIE.**\n\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 6) on T23:\nT23: My Head (8, 6). E1 potential Head (6, 6).\nT24: I move LEFT to (7, 6) [Consumption].\nT24: E1 moves RIGHT to (7, 6) [Consumption]. -> Head-on collision at (7, 6). **Both DIE.**\n\nSince the enemy is already aligned horizontally with the target (7, 6) and moving RIGHT is the shortest path for them, they are very likely to choose RIGHT to (6, 6) this turn (T23). This sets up a guaranteed simultaneous approach to A4 (7, 6) on T24, leading to a fatal collision.\n\nI must avoid A4 (7, 6) for now, as it is contested and highly risky. Since the enemy seems committed to A4, I should pivot to another apple.\n\nNew targets: A5 (9, 1), A1 (9, 0), A2 (4, 0).\n\nMy Head (8, 7).\nA5 (9, 1): Distance 7. Path: (8, 7) -> (9, 7) -> ... -> (9, 1). Or (8, 7) -> (8, 6) -> ...\nA1 (9, 0): Distance 8.\nA2 (4, 0): Distance 11.\n\nLet's look at moves from (8, 7) that are safe and lead away from collision zone:\n1. UP (8, 8): Hits my old head position (neck). **DEAD**. My body is [(8, 8), (7, 8), ...].\n2. DOWN (8, 6): Safe. Leads towards A5/A1.\n3. LEFT (7, 7): Leads inexorably towards A4. **RISKY**.\n4. RIGHT (9, 7): Safe. Leads towards A5/A1.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Comparing DOWN vs RIGHT:**\n\n**Option 1: RIGHT to (9, 7)**\n(9, 7) is 6 steps from A5 (9, 1) and 7 steps from A1 (9, 0).\nT23: (9, 7).\nT24: (9, 6) or (8, 7) (if I go back for A5).\nThis move keeps me on the right side of the map, aiming for (9, 1) and (9, 0).\n\n**Option 2: DOWN to (8, 6)**\n(8, 6) is 6 steps from A5 (9, 1) and 7 steps from A1 (9, 0).\nT23: (8, 6).\nT24: (8, 5) or (9, 6).\nThis move is slightly better for approaching A5 (9, 1) or A1 (9, 0) as it gets me closer vertically immediately. (9, 1) or (9, 0) are on the bottom edge.\n\nLet's look at the distance to A5 (9, 1) again. L1=7.\nPath 1 (via RIGHT): (8, 7) R (9, 7) D (9, 6) D (9, 5) D (9, 4) D (9, 3) D (9, 2) D (9, 1). 7 moves total.\nPath 2 (via DOWN): (8, 7) D (8, 6) D (8, 5) D (8, 4) D (8, 3) D (8, 2) D (8, 1) R (9, 1). 8 moves total.\n\nWait, my calculation must minimize distance.\n(8, 7) to (9, 1) is 1 RIGHT and 6 DOWN. Total 7.\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 7): 6 DOWN remaining. Total 7.\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 6): 1 RIGHT and 5 DOWN remaining (to (9, 1)). Total 7.\nThe distance remains 7 regardless of whether I take R or D first, assuming I take the shortest path afterwards.\n\n(8, 7) to (9, 1).\nMove RIGHT to (9, 7). I am now on the Y-line of the apple. This feels cleaner for A1/A5.\nMove DOWN to (8, 6). I still need to move RIGHT later.\n\nSince the enemy is likely heading to (7, 6), moving RIGHT to (9, 7) keeps me far away from the contested area and starts my path towards A1/A5.\n\n**3. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head: 8, 7)**\n\nCurrent body coordinates (T): (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7).\nTail location (cell that will be freed): (3, 7) if I do not eat. (I did eat last turn, so the tail is (3, 7). Length is 8. The new tail will be (3, 7), so (3, 8) remains a T block). Wait, if I ate, my tail **did not move**. The body segments are simply shifted back and the new head is added.\nMy Body: [(8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7)]. Length 8.\nIf I do not eat this turn, the segment (3, 7) will be freed.\n\n1. **UP (8, 8):** Hits my neck. **DEAD**.\n2. **DOWN (8, 6):** Safe. (Empty)\n3. **LEFT (7, 7):** Safe. (Empty) - But leads to collision risk at A4.\n4. **RIGHT (9, 7):** Safe. (Empty)\n\nSafe Moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**4. Final Selection**\n\nI ruled out LEFT due to high collision risk with E1 aggressively pursuing A4 (7, 6).\nI choose RIGHT to (9, 7) as it pulls me away from the center action and positions me optimally for A5 (9, 1) and A1 (9, 0).\n\nE1 is targeting (7, 6) (L1=2). If E1 moves RIGHT to (6, 6) (L1=1 remaining to A4), they will secure A4 on T24 unless I block or collide. If I ignore it, E1 gets A4.\nIf I secure A5 and A1, I add 2 apples. E1 gets A4, adding 1 apple.\nNew scores: Me: 8, E1: 9. Gap reduced.\n\nA better outcome than dying in a head-on collision trying to save A4.\n\nStrategy: Use RIGHT to get to (9, 7). Then proceed DOWN to (9, 1) followed by (9, 0). 7 moves to A5, 1 move to A1. Total 8 moves for 2 apples.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nT23: RIGHT to (9, 7). Start approach for A5 (9, 1).\nT24: DOWN to (9, 6).\nT25: DOWN to (9, 5).\n...\nT29: DOWN to (9, 1). [A5 consumed].\nT30: DOWN to (9, 0). [A1 consumed].\nThis sequence is highly predictable and safe unless E1 decides to pursue these far corners.\n\nRIGHT",

No.  \n  Safe unless enemy head moves there simultaneously.\n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4, 6):  \n  My body? Yes \u2014 it\u2019s the first segment behind my head. Immediate suicide.

Others (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) are *potentially* safe.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Check simultaneous collisions with enemy snake head (8, 7):**\n\nEnemy possible moves from (8, 7):  \n- UP \u2192 (8, 8): Enemy body there?

Safe for them.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 7): In bounds, empty. Safe for them.\n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nTheir destinations:  \nDOWN \u2192 (8, 6)  \nLEFT \u2192 (7, 7)  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9, 7)\n\nOur destinations if we choose:  \nUP \u2192 (5, 7)  \nDOWN \u2192 (5, 5)  \nRIGHT \u2192 (6, 6)  \n\nNo overlap between {5,7; 5,5; 6,6} and {8,6; 7,7; 9,7} \u2192 no head-on collision possible this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Choose among UP, DOWN, RIGHT:**\n\n**Apple distances from my head (5,6):**  \n- (7,6): Manhattan dist = |7-5| + |6-6| = 2  \n- (1,2): dist = 4 + 4 = 8  \n- (4,0): dist = 1 + 6 = 7  \n- (9,0): dist = 4 + 6 = 10  \n- (9,1): dist = 4 + 5 = 9  \n\nClosest apple: (7,6) at distance 2.\n\n**If I go:**  \n- UP (5,7): dist to (7,6) = |7-5| + |6-7| = 2 + 1 = 3 (farther)  \n- DOWN (5,5): dist to (7,6) = 2 + 1 = 3 (farther)  \n- RIGHT (6,6): dist to (7,6) = 1 + 0 = 1 (closer)\n\nSo RIGHT moves me closer to nearest apple.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future move options after each choice:**\n\n- **RIGHT to (6,6):**  \n  Next turn body: head at (6,6), body segments: (5,6), (4,6), \u2026  \n  Possible moves from (6,6):  \n  UP (6,7): empty, not body.  \n  DOWN (6,5): empty, not body.  \n  LEFT (5,6): my body (old head) \u2192 suicide.  \n  RIGHT (7,6): apple there \u2192 if I go RIGHT next turn, I eat apple (7,6) and grow.  \n  So safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).\n\n- **UP to (5,7):**  \n  Next turn body: head at (5,7), body: (5,6), (4,6), \u2026  \n  Moves from (5,7):  \n  UP (5,8): empty? No \u2014 enemy body at (5,8) \u2192 lethal into enemy body.  \n  DOWN (5,6): my body \u2192 suicide.  \n  LEFT (4,7): empty, safe.  \n  RIGHT (6,7): empty, safe.  \n  So safe moves next turn: LEFT, RIGHT (only 2 options).\n\n- **DOWN to (5,5):**  \n  Next turn body: head at (5,5), body: (5,6), (4,6), \u2026  \n  Moves from (5,5):  \n  UP (5,6): my body \u2192 suicide.  \n  DOWN (5,4): empty, safe.  \n  LEFT (4,5): empty, safe.  \n  RIGHT (6,5): empty, safe.  \n  So safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).\n\nSo UP reduces future options more than RIGHT or DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Avoid enemy proximity:**  \nEnemy head at (8,7) moving possibly DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT. If I go RIGHT to (6,6), I\u2019m moving toward apple (7,6), but enemy\u2019s closest safe move to that apple is LEFT to (7,7) then next turn could go DOWN to (7,6) same time I go RIGHT to (7,6) \u2192 head-on collision next turn if we both target it.  \n\nBut this turn, RIGHT is safe and gives me a chance to get apple next turn before enemy if they don\u2019t go LEFT now. If enemy goes LEFT to (7,7), then next turn they could go DOWN to (7,6) \u2014 but I\u2019ll be at (6,6), so I could go RIGHT to (7,6) same turn they go DOWN to (7,6) \u2192 collision. Might need to check enemy\u2019s likely move: they might not go LEFT if they see risk? But I can\u2019t predict perfectly. Still, RIGHT seems best for growth and options.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nFrom (6,6) next turn, if enemy at (7,7), going RIGHT to (7,6) risks head-on collision. If enemy at (8,6) or (9,7), less risk. Could go UP/DOWN instead to avoid collision and target other apples. But getting apple (7,6) soon is key to extending lead.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** RIGHT maximizes progress toward nearest apple, keeps good future move options, avoids immediate danger.\n\nRIGHT",

(Prior move: DOWN from (9, 7) to (9, 6)).\nEnemy Snake #1 (ID 1): Head (7, 6). Length 10. Body: [(6, 6), (5, 6), (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6), (1, 6), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 4)]. Apples: 9. (Prior move: RIGHT from (6, 6) to (7, 6) and ate an apple).\n\nApples (A): A1 (9, 0), A2 (4, 0), A3 (1, 2), A4 (9, 1), A5 (9, 8). (Note: The apple formerly at (7, 6) was eaten by S1. The apple visualization shows A5 at (9, 8), not the previous (7, 6)).\n\nScores: Me: 6, Enemy: 9. Enemy leads by 3 apples.\n\n**2. Evaluate Immediate Targets and Strategy**\nMy current position (9, 6) is designed to move along the X=9 column to capture A4 (9, 1) and A1 (9, 0).\n\nMy Head: (9, 6).\nTarget A4 (9, 1): L1 Distance: 5 DOWN.\nTarget A1 (9, 0): L1 Distance: 6 DOWN.\nTarget A5 (9, 8): L1 Distance: 2 UP.\n\nThe enemy snake S1 is at (7, 6), having just eaten. It is L-shaped towards the bottom-left corner. Its primary targets are likely A3 (1, 2) or perhaps A2 (4, 0). It is unlikely to interfere with my path in the X=9 column.\n\n**3. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head: 9, 6)**\nCurrent body segments (T) in order: (9, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8). (Length 9, though only the first 6 are explicitly listed in the Board State, I must account for the full length since I did not eat). Wait, my body listing is 6 segments long: [(9, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8)]. My head is (9, 6). My total length is $1 (Head) + 6 (Listed Body) = 7$. Wait, *My snake (ID: 0):* - *Body: [(9, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8)]* (6 segments). The previous state had length 8. I moved DOWN from (9, 7) to (9, 6) (not eating). *If I did not eat, my length should have remained 8, and the tail (4, 8) in the previous turn) should have disappeared.*\n\nLet's assume the body list provided `[(9, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (5, 8)]` is correct for the current state (length 7). The tail segments would be freeing up. The current tail is (5, 8). Since I did not eat, (5, 8) will become free in the next turn (T26).\n\n1. **UP (9, 7):** Hits my neck (9, 7). **DEAD**.\n2. **DOWN (9, 5):** Safe. (Empty cell). This continues the path to A4 (9, 1) and A1 (9, 0).\n3. **LEFT (8, 6):** Safe. (Empty cell).\n4. **RIGHT (10, 6):** Off the board. **DEAD**.\n\nSafe Moves: DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**4. Check for Collisions with Enemy Snake**\nEnemy head (7, 6).\nEnemy body is long and centered around X=1 to X=7, Y=6.\n\nIf I move DOWN (9, 5): Safe.\nIf I move LEFT (8, 6): Safe. The enemy is at (7, 6). If the enemy moves RIGHT to (8, 6), we collide head-on. This is unlikely as (8, 6) is an empty, non-apple square, and S1 is trying to win. If S1 moves RIGHT, it is likely trying to get towards A5 (9, 8) or turn up the board, but (7, 6) is quite far from A5. The most logical moves for S1 are movements towards A3 (1, 2) or A2 (4, 0).\nS1's possible moves from (7, 6):\n* RIGHT (8, 6): Collision risk if I choose LEFT (8, 6).\n* UP (7, 7): Safe.\n* DOWN (7, 5): Safe.\n* LEFT (6, 6): Hits its neck (6, 6). DEAD.\n\nSince S1 only has three safe directions, and my movement LEFT puts me into a potential head-on collision spot (8, 6) with S1 if they choose RIGHT, moving LEFT is risky.\n\nMoving DOWN to (9, 5) keeps me on the clear right edge of the board, far from S1, and directly towards my target apples (9, 1) and (9, 0).\n\n**5. Final Selection**\nThe plan to continue moving DOWN to secure the two apples at the bottom right corner (9, 1 and 9, 0) is sound, safe, and necessary to catch up in score.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Continue moving DOWN along X=9 until (9, 0) is reached, collecting apples A4 (9, 1) and A1 (9, 0). Then evaluate new targets, likely A3 (1, 2) or A2 (4, 0), depending on S1's position.\n\nDOWN",

But I can\u2019t rely on that. RIGHT is dangerous because if they go LEFT, we collide.\n\nSo eliminate RIGHT for safety.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Remaining moves UP vs DOWN:**  \nFrom (7, 6):  \nUP \u2192 (7, 7): safe, no head-on possible (enemy can\u2019t reach (7, 7) in one move).  \nDOWN \u2192 (7, 5): safe, no head-on possible (enemy can\u2019t reach (7, 5) in one move).\n\nCheck future safety:  \nIf UP to (7, 7): next turn moves: UP (7, 8): enemy body at (7, 8) \u2192 suicide; DOWN (7, 6): my body; LEFT (6, 7): empty; RIGHT (8, 7): enemy body at (8, 7) \u2192 suicide. So only LEFT safe next turn \u2192 dead end. Bad.\n\nIf DOWN to (7, 5): next turn moves: UP (7, 6): my body \u2192 suicide; DOWN (7, 4): empty; LEFT (6, 5): empty; RIGHT (8, 5): empty. So 3 safe moves next turn. Good.\n\nSo DOWN is better for future options.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nMove DOWN to (7, 5), then next turn consider going toward (9, 1) or (4, 0) while staying flexible.

It is now positioned slightly below the horizontal mass of its body (Y=6). Its primary targets are likely still A3 (1, 2) or A2 (4, 0).\n\n**3. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head: 9, 5)**\nCurrent body segments (T) in order: (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8). (Tail: (6, 8)).

Given S1's position, moving towards the right edge (8, 5, 9, 5) might be appealing to them to potentially challenge A5 (9, 8) or me, although (7, 4) or (6, 5) heading towards A2/A3 seems more logical given their current body orientation. Since there is a risk, and my current objective is clear and safe, I should avoid LEFT.\n\nMoving DOWN to (9, 4) is entirely safe from S1, keeps me on my target path, and ensures I capture the two bottom-right apples in the next few turns.\n\n**5. Final Selection**\nContinue the movement DOWN along the X=9 column.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Next 3 turns):**\nT27: Move DOWN to (9, 4).\nT28: Move DOWN to (9, 3).\nT29: Move DOWN to (9, 2).\nT30: Move DOWN to (9, 1) [Eat A4].\nAfter securing A4 and A1, re-evaluate targets, looking likely at A3 (1, 2) or A2 (4, 0), depending on S1's position.\n\nDOWN",

But (7, 5) will be occupied by my body segment (old head) next turn \u2192 so LEFT into (7, 5) would be suicide. So next turn from (8, 5): UP, DOWN safe, LEFT unsafe, RIGHT (9,5) possibly enemy.  \n\nIf LEFT to (6, 5): next turn moves: UP (6, 6): my body? Yes, my body segment at (6, 6) will still be there \u2192 suicide. DOWN (6, 4): empty; LEFT (5, 5): empty; RIGHT (7, 5): my body \u2192 suicide.

Eliminate RIGHT for safety.\n\nNow between LEFT (6, 5) and DOWN (7, 4):  \nLEFT gives fewer safe moves next turn (2 options).  \nDOWN gives 3 safe moves next turn and avoids enemy head collision risk now.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \nMove DOWN to (7, 4) to preserve flexibility, then aim for apple (9, 1) or (9, 0) via right/down moves while keeping enemy head at (9, 5) in mind. Enemy may move toward (9, 6) or (9, 4) or (8, 5), so staying left/down initially avoids conflict.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Collision Check (Snake 0 vs Snake 1)**\n\n*   **My DOWN (9, 2):** No collision risk with S1, as S1 is far away (min distance 2). This continues my apple pursuit.\n*   **My LEFT (8, 3):**\n    *   If S1 moves RIGHT (8, 3): Head-on collision. **DEAD**.\n    *   If S1 moves DOWN (7, 2) or LEFT (6, 3): Safe.\n\nSince S1 could realistically move RIGHT to (8, 3) to try and intercept the X=9 column or push me into a corner, moving LEFT is risky. The space at (8, 3) is a potential choke point if both snakes were trying to move across the board.\n\nThe best move is DOWN towards the easy apples, which is completely collision-free and maximizes my objective.\n\n**6. Final Selection and Micro-Plan**\nMove DOWN to (9, 2).\n\n*T28*: Move DOWN to (9, 2).\n*T29*: Move DOWN to (9, 1) [Eat A4].\n*T30*: Move DOWN to (9, 0) [Eat A1].\n\nThis strategy secures two immediate apples and brings my score closer to S1's score.\n\nDOWN",

Eliminate deadly moves:**\n\n- **UP (6, 3):**  \n  Check collisions:  \n  - Not out of bounds (y=3 in 0\u20139).  \n  - Not in my body? My body has (7, 3) yes, but (6, 3) is not in my body list. Wait \u2014 my body list: (7, 3) is there, (6, 3) is not. So safe from self-body.  \n  - Not in enemy body? Enemy body: (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7). No (6, 3).  \n  - Head-on collision? Enemy head currently at (9, 1). Could enemy move to (6, 3) this turn? Unlikely, they\u2019d need to move 3 left and 2 up in one turn \u2014 impossible. So safe from head-on.  \n  **UP seems safe.**\n\n- **DOWN (6, 1):**  \n  - In bounds (y=1).  \n  - Not in my body (none at (6, 1)).  \n  - Not in enemy body.  \n  - Enemy head could move DOWN from (9, 1) to (9, 0) \u2014 not same cell. Could move LEFT to (8, 1) \u2014 not same. Could move UP to (9, 2) \u2014 no. Could move RIGHT? out of bounds. So no head-on.  \n  **DOWN safe.**\n\n- **LEFT (5, 2):**  \n  - In bounds (x=5).  \n  - Not in my body (none at (5, 2)).  \n  - Not in enemy body.  \n  - Enemy head could move LEFT to (8, 1) \u2014 no. Could move DOWN to (9, 0) \u2014 no. Could move UP to (9, 2) \u2014 no. Could move RIGHT? out of bounds. So safe.  \n  **LEFT safe.**\n\n- **RIGHT (7, 2):**  \n  - In bounds (x=7).  \n  - My body: (7, 2) is the second segment of my snake (right after head). That\u2019s moving backwards into my own neck \u2014 instant death.  \n  **RIGHT unsafe.**\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**2. Evaluate safe moves for future options/apple proximity:**\n\nApples:  \n(9, 0) \u2014 far.  \n(4, 0) \u2014 far.  \n(1, 2) \u2014 left side.  \n(9, 8) \u2014 far.  \n(6, 0) \u2014 below current head.\n\nFrom (6, 2):\n\n- **UP (6, 3):**  \n  Closer to apples? Not really; moves away from (6, 0), away from (1, 2). But opens space maybe. Future moves from (6, 3): up to (6, 4) safe? Check: (6, 4) not in my body, not enemy body. Seems okay. Could go left/right/up later.\n\n- **DOWN (6, 1):**  \n  Gets closer to apple at (6, 0) \u2014 next turn could go DOWN to eat it. But need to check if enemy could get there first? Enemy at (9, 1) \u2014 could move LEFT repeatedly to get to (6, 0)? No, they\u2019re 3 cells away in x, 1 in y. They could go (9, 1) \u2192 (8, 1) \u2192 (7, 1) \u2192 (6, 1) in 3 moves, but they won\u2019t reach (6, 0) before me if I go DOWN now then DOWN next turn. Actually, if I go to (6, 1), they\u2019d need two moves to reach (6, 0) from (9, 1) \u2014 impossible in 1 turn. So safe to go for apple.  \n  Future from (6, 1): can go DOWN to apple (6, 0), LEFT to (5, 1), RIGHT to (7, 1) \u2014 check (7, 1) safe? My body has (7, 2), not (7, 1). Enemy body? No. So fine.\n\n- **LEFT (5, 2):**  \n  Closer to apple at (1, 2) but still far. Future from (5, 2): can go LEFT to (4, 2) etc. But apple at (4, 0) is down from there.\n\n---\n\n**3. Head-on collision risk this turn:**\n\nEnemy head (9, 1) possible moves:  \nUP \u2192 (9, 2) \u2014 safe from collision with any of my possible moves.  \nDOWN \u2192 (9, 0) \u2014 safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (8, 1) \u2014 safe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 out of bounds, so enemy won\u2019t choose that.\n\nNo overlap with my (6, 3), (6, 1), or (5, 2). So all safe.\n\n---\n\n**4. Which is best?**\n\nGoing DOWN (6, 1) sets up to eat apple (6, 0) next turn, growing. That\u2019s immediate progress toward 50 apples.  \n\nUP or LEFT don\u2019t get me closer to an apple as directly.\n\nAlso, DOWN keeps options: from (6, 1), I can go DOWN to apple, or LEFT/RIGHT to avoid traps.  \n\nCheck if (6, 1) is dangerous next turn: enemy could move to (8, 1) or (9, 0) or (9, 2), none threaten (6, 1) next turn. So safe.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating (6, 0), my tail will move forward, so my body will extend. Need to avoid boxing myself in. After eating, consider moving toward (4, 0) or (1, 2), but watch enemy path.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** DOWN",

The board state diagram still shows it as '0' (my snake body segment/tail) but the updated apple list reflects the remaining apples.\n\nScores: Me: 8, Enemy: 9. Enemy leads by 1 apple.\n\n**2. Evaluate Immediate Targets and Strategy (Snake 0)**\nMy Head: (9, 0).\nNearest apples:\nA4 (6, 0): L1 Distance 3 (LEFT).\nA1 (4, 0): L1 Distance 5 (LEFT).\n\nStrategy: I am currently positioned on the bottom wall. Moving LEFT towards (6, 0) and then (4, 0) seems the most efficient path. The enemy snake (Head (6, 1)) is also positioned close to (6, 0).\n\n**3.

(Empty cell, straight path toward apples (6, 0) and (4, 0)).\n4. **RIGHT (10, 0):** Off the board. **DEAD**.\n\nSafe Moves: LEFT. (Only one safe move confirmed).\n\n*Self-Correction/Verification*: I must move LEFT. There is no other option.\n\n**4. Analyze Enemy (Snake 1 Head: 6, 1)**\nS1 Head: (6, 1).\nS1 nearest apples: A4 (6, 0) [L1 Dist 1, DOWN], A1 (4, 0) [L1 Dist 3, LEFT/DOWN], A5 (8, 3) [L1 Dist 4].\n\nS1 is extremely likely to move DOWN to grab A4 (6, 0) this turn.\n\nS1's safe moves (Body: (6, 2), (7, 2)... (4, 6)):\n1. **UP (6, 2):** Hits its neck (6, 2). **DEAD**.\n2. **DOWN (6, 0):** Moves onto A4. Safe. (HIGHLY LIKELY).\n3. **LEFT (5, 1):** Safe (Empty). Moves toward A1 (4, 0).\n4. **RIGHT (7, 1):** Safe (Empty).\n\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (6, 0), it collects an apple and ties the score at 9-9.\n\n**5. Collision Check (Snake 0 Head: 9, 0 vs Snake 1 Head: 6, 1)**\n\nMy only safe move is LEFT to (8, 0).\n\n*   **My move LEFT (8, 0):**\n    *   S1 moves to (6, 0), (5, 1), or (7, 1).\n    *   (8, 0) is safe from all these potential S1 moves.\n\n**6.

I should continue chasing A1 (4, 0) along the bottom wall.\n\nPlan: T31: LEFT (to 8, 0). T32: LEFT (to 7, 0). T33: LEFT (to 6, 0) -- wait, S1 ate (6, 0) already. T33: LEFT (to 5, 0).

(The previous score was 9, indicating Snake 1 ate (6, 0) last turn).\n\nApples (A): A1 (4, 0), A2 (1, 2), A3 (9, 8), A4 (8, 3), A5 (2, 5).\n\nScores: Me: 8, Enemy: 10. Enemy leads by 2 apples.\n\n**2. Evaluate Immediate Targets and Strategy (Snake 0)**\nMy Head: (8, 0).\nNearest apples:\nA1 (4, 0): L1 Distance 4 (LEFT). *Crucial apple to contest.*\nA4 (8, 3): L1 Distance 3 (UP).\n\nEnemy Snake 1 Head: (6, 0).\nS1 is also positioned on the bottom wall, near A1 (4, 0). S1 is only 2 steps away. I am 4 steps away. S1 has the path advantage to (4, 0).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 0), and S1 moves LEFT to (5, 0), S1 will likely reach (4, 0) before I do.\n\nIf I pivot UP towards A4 (8, 3), I avoid the competition with S1 for A1.\n\n**Priorities:**\n1. Survival.\n2. Eat an apple.\n3. Don't let S1 eat another apple unopposed.\n\n**3. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head: 8, 0)**\nObstacles: My body, S1's head/body, Walls.\nMy body segments: (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7). (Note: My tail is (9, 7)).\n\n1. **UP (8, 1):** Safe. (Empty space). Leads toward A4 (8, 3).\n2. **DOWN (8, -1):** Off the board. **DEAD**.\n3. **LEFT (7, 0):** Safe. (Empty space). Leads toward A1 (4, 0). Contests S1.\n4. **RIGHT (9, 0):** Hits my neck (9, 0). **DEAD**.\n\nSafe Moves: UP, LEFT.\n\n**4. Evaluate Safe Moves**\n\n*   **Option A: LEFT (to 7, 0)**\n    *   Goal: Contest A1 (4, 0).\n    *   Risk: S1 is likely to move LEFT to (5, 0). If S1 continues LEFT-ward, S1 gets (4, 0) next turn (T33). I reach it on T34. This is a losing race.\n\n*   **Option B: UP (to 8, 1)**\n    *   Goal: Go for A4 (8, 3). Distance 2 moves.\n    *   Path: (8, 0) -> (8, 1) -> (8, 2) -> (8, 3).\n    *   S1's likely moves from (6, 0):\n        *   S1 UP (6, 1): Moves away from A1.\n        *   S1 LEFT (5, 0): Moves towards A1. (Most likely given S1's previous heading).\n    *   If S1 goes LEFT, I am free to move UP.\n    *   If I move UP, I can reach A4 (8, 3) in 3 turns (T35).\n\nLet's re-calculate A4 distance: (8, 0) -> (8, 1) -> (8, 2) -> (8, 3). 3 moves. T33: (8, 1). T34: (8, 2). T35: (8, 3).\nWait, A4 is at (8, 3). Distance is 3.\n\nLet's check the distance to A1 (4, 0) for S1 (6, 0):\nT33: (5, 0). T34: (4, 0). (2 moves).\n\nSince S1 can get A1 in 2 moves, I cannot successfully challenge A1. I must go UP.\n\n**5. Collision and Trapping Check (UP to (8, 1))**\n\n*   My path: (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3) (Apple). All these cells are currently empty.\n*   S1 is positioned far enough away (6, 0) that it cannot interfere with (8, 1) this turn. It would take a move to (7, 0) for S1 to come closer, but S1 already has better targets.\n\nThe move UP seems safe and sets me up for an uncontested apple.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nT32: UP (to 8, 1). Goal: A4 (8, 3).\nT33: UP (to 8, 2).\nT34: UP (to 8, 3, eat A4).\nAfter T34, I will be at (8, 3). Potential targets are A3 (9, 8) or A5 (2, 5).\n\nUP",

Wait, last turn head was at (6,1), I moved DOWN to (6,0) and ate that apple. Now my head is at (6,0), body grew by 1 segment so tail is still at (4,6) but body longer by 1 at the head. Let's check:  \n\nBefore last turn: head (6,1), body (6,2) ... (4,6).  \nLast move: DOWN \u2192 head to (6,0), new segment added at old head position (6,1).  \nSo now body: head (6,0), then (6,1), (6,2), (7,2), \u2026 (4,6). Yes, that matches given: [(6,1), (6,2), \u2026 (4,6)].  \n\n---\n\n**Possible moves from (6,0):**  \n- UP \u2192 (6,1): occupied by my own body \u2192 suicide.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,-1): off board \u2192 suicide.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,0): free (check board: at (5,0) is empty '.').  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,0): free (check board: at (7,0) is '.').  \n\nSo only LEFT and RIGHT are safe.  \n\n**Enemy possible moves from (8,0):**  \nEnemy\u2019s body occupies (9,0) behind it, so enemy can\u2019t go RIGHT (off board at (9,0) is its body? Wait, (9,0) is part of its body, so moving into it is suicide for enemy). So enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP to (8,1) (free), LEFT to (7,0) (free), DOWN to (8,-1) off board (invalid). So enemy likely moves UP or LEFT.  \n\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (7,0) same time I move RIGHT to (7,0), head-on collision \u2192 both die. That\u2019s bad because I have more apples (10 vs 8).  \n\nIf enemy moves UP to (8,1), then my RIGHT to (7,0) is safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is (4,0), two steps LEFT from (6,0).  \nIf I go LEFT now to (5,0), next turn I can go LEFT to (4,0) and eat it.  \nIf I go RIGHT now to (7,0), I\u2019m moving away from (4,0) and closer to enemy\u2019s territory, maybe toward apple (8,3) but enemy might get there first.  \n\nAlso, (5,0) is safe regardless of enemy\u2019s move (enemy can\u2019t reach (5,0) in one move from (8,0)).  \n(7,0) is risky due to possible head-on if enemy goes LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Future options:**  \nFrom (5,0): next turn after eating (4,0), I could go UP to (5,1) or continue LEFT to (3,0) etc.  \nFrom (7,0): next turn options are UP (7,1) free, DOWN off board, LEFT back to (6,0) (occupied by my body next turn), RIGHT (8,0) possibly occupied by enemy\u2019s tail if it moves. So (7,0) gives fewer safe next moves.  \n\nLEFT seems better:  \n- Safer (no risk of head-on).  \n- Gets me closer to apple (4,0).  \n- Keeps distance from enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter LEFT to (5,0), next turn go LEFT to (4,0) to eat apple \u2192 11 apples. Then from (4,0), consider going UP to (4,1) (free) to avoid trapping myself in bottom row, then aim for (1,2) or (2,5) while monitoring enemy movement toward (8,3) or (9,8). Avoid dead ends and keep escape routes.  \n\nLEFT",

So safe: UP and LEFT.  \nThat\u2019s not too restrictive, and I\u2019d have just eaten an apple.  \n\n**If UP to (5,1):**  \nFrom (5,1): possible moves: UP (5,2) free, DOWN (5,0) free? Wait, (5,0) will be empty after I move (tail at (5,6) doesn\u2019t move unless apple eaten). Yes, so DOWN back to (5,0) safe, LEFT (4,1) free, RIGHT (6,1) occupied by my body. So safe: UP, DOWN, LEFT. More options next turn. But apple (4,0) still available for later, though enemy might take it if they head that way.  \n\n---\n\n**Safety and score:**  \nEating apple now gives me +1 apple lead over enemy (11 vs 8). That\u2019s good for endgame.  \nUP gives more next-move options but delays eating.  \n\nGiven the enemy is at (8,1), they might go for apple (8,3) or (9,8). Apple (4,0) is far from them, so likely safe for me next turn if I don\u2019t take it now. But if I take it now, I secure it.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nIf I eat apple at (4,0), next turn go UP to (4,1) to avoid trapping myself on bottom row. Then consider path toward (1,2) or (2,5). Watch enemy movement toward (8,3) or (9,8). Avoid getting near enemy head until necessary.  \n\nLEFT seems slightly better because it secures apple now and still leaves UP open next turn. UP is safe and gives flexibility, but apple could be eaten by enemy later if they move down leftwards.  \n\nActually, enemy\u2019s closest apples are (8,3) and (9,8), not (4,0). So (4,0) is relatively safe for me to get next turn if I go UP now. But going LEFT now is fine too.  \n\nGiven my last move was LEFT (to get to (5,0)), continuing LEFT to eat apple seems consistent with earlier plan.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

The apples provided in the current state are the remaining ones.\n\nScores: Me: 8, Enemy: 11. Enemy leads by 3 apples. I must secure A3 (8, 3) immediately.\n\n**2. Evaluate Immediate Targets and Strategy (Snake 0)**\nMy Head: (8, 2).\nThe immediate target is A3 (8, 3). This is 1 move UP.\n\nEnemy Snake 1 Head: (4, 0).\nS1 likely wants to move toward A4 (2, 5) or A1 (1, 2).\nPossible moves for S1: UP (4, 1), RIGHT (5, 0 - hits own body), DOWN (4, -1 - wall), LEFT (3, 0).\nIf S1 moves UP (4, 1), it opens up toward the center.\nIf S1 moves LEFT (3, 0), it continues along the bottom wall.\n\n**3. Determine Safe Moves for Snake 0 (Head: 8, 2)**\nObstacles: My body, S1's head/body, Walls.\n\nMy body segments: (8, 1) (neck), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5).\nS1 body segments: (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (6, 6), (5, 6).\n\n1. **UP (8, 3):** Land on apple A3. Safe. (The planned move.)\n2. **DOWN (8, 1):** Hits my neck (8, 1). **DEAD**.\n3. **LEFT (7, 2):** Hits S1 body (7, 2). **DEAD**.\n4. **RIGHT (9, 2):** Hits my body (9, 2). **DEAD**.\n\nSafe Moves: Only UP.\n\n**4. Execute Move**\nThe only safe move is UP, which directly results in eating Apple A3 (8, 3).\n\n**5. Collision Check (UP to (8, 3))**\n*   (8, 3) is currently an apple location.\n*   S1 Head is at (4, 0). S1 cannot reach (8, 3) in one turn. No head-on collision risk.\n*   The move is entirely safe and results in an apple.\n\n**Long-term Plan (After eating A3 at T34):**\nNew Head: (8, 3). New Length: 10. Apples: 9.\nRemaining Appetites: A1 (1, 2), A2 (9, 8), A4 (2, 5), A5 (1, 6).\n\nA2 (9, 8) is the closest apple in terms of (X, Y) proximity, but reaching it requires navigating around my existing body cluster (9, Y).\n*   A2 (9, 8) -> 1 RIGHT, 5 UP (6 moves).\n*   A4 (2, 5) -> 6 LEFT, 2 UP (8 moves).\n*   A5 (1, 6) -> 7 LEFT, 3 UP (10 moves).\n*   A1 (1, 2) -> 7 LEFT, 1 DOWN (8 moves).\n\nA2 (9, 8) is the best next target. From (8, 3):\nT35: RIGHT (9, 3). (This is safe, (9, 3) is currently my body, but it will become my tail (9, 5) if I eat A3, so (9, 3) is free. Wait, if I eat A3, my tail stays at (9, 5). If I move R to (9, 3), the segment (9, 3) is NOT my head's body segment, my body is (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3--this is a PROBLEM).\n\nLet's re-examine body segments after eating A3 (8, 3).\nCurrent Body: [(8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5)]\nNew Head: (8, 3).\nNew Body (T34, eating apple): [(8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5)]. (Tail remains (9, 5)).\n\nNext turn (T35), from (8, 3):\n1. UP (8, 4): Safe. Moves closer to A2 (9, 8).\n2. RIGHT (9, 3): Hits body segment (9, 3). **DEAD**.\n3. LEFT (7, 3): Safe.\n4. DOWN (8, 2): Hits body segment (8, 2). **DEAD**.\n\nI need to move UP to (8, 4) or LEFT to (7, 3). Moving UP leads toward A2 (9, 8).\n\nT35 Plan (from 8, 3): UP (8, 4).\nT36 Plan (from 8, 4): UP (8, 5) or RIGHT (9, 4) (My body (9, 4) is still there, so only UP).\nT37 Plan (from 8, 5): UP (8, 6).\nT38 Plan (from 8, 6): UP (8, 7).\nT39 Plan (from 8, 7): UP (8, 8).\nT40 Plan (from 8, 8): UP (8, 9) or RIGHT (9, 8) (A2).\n\nThis suggests getting A2 (9, 8) from the left side (8, 8) then RIGHT. This gives S1 a lot of time to get closer to the central apples (A1, A4, A5).\n\nHowever, for the current turn, UP is the only safe and optimal move.\n\nUP",

So no head-on risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nNeither UP (4,1) nor LEFT (3,0) eats an apple immediately.  \nClosest apples to me are (1,2) and (2,5).  \nFrom (4,1), I'm closer to (2,5) and (1,2) than from (3,0).  \nFrom (3,0), I'm closer to (1,2) horizontally but farther from (2,5).  \n\n---\n\n**Future options after each move:**  \n\n**If UP to (4,1):**  \nFrom (4,1): possible moves: UP (4,2) free, DOWN (4,0) free (tail will move next turn unless apple eaten), LEFT (3,1) free, RIGHT (5,1) free (since (5,1) is not in my body). Wait, check my body: (5,6), (6,6), (7,6), (7,5), (7,4), (7,3), (7,2), (6,2), (6,1), (6,0), (5,0). (5,1) is not in that list. So all four directions from (4,1) are free next turn if tail moves. That's very open.\n\n**If LEFT to (3,0):**  \nFrom (3,0): possible moves: UP (3,1) free, DOWN off board \u274c, LEFT (2,0) free, RIGHT (4,0) occupied by my body next turn? Wait, my tail is at (5,6), so after I move, my body will be [(4,0), (5,0), (6,0), ...], so (4,0) will be my neck, occupied. So RIGHT is blocked. DOWN is off board. So only UP and LEFT are safe next turn from (3,0). More restrictive.\n\n---\n\n**Safety and score:**  \nUP gives more options next turn. LEFT restricts me to bottom row with fewer exits.  \nEnemy is going to (8,3), far from me. No immediate threat.  \n\nLong-term: I want to path toward apples (1,2) and (2,5). From (4,1), I can go UP then LEFT toward them. From (3,0), I'm stuck on bottom row until I go UP anyway.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nGo UP now to keep flexibility. Then move toward (2,5) or (1,2) while watching enemy movement. Avoid getting near enemy head.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

Leads toward A2 (9, 8).\n2. **DOWN (8, 2):**\n   *   Hits my body segment (8, 2). **DEAD**.\n3. **LEFT (7, 3):**\n   *   (7, 3) is a segment of S1's body. Head: (4, 1), Body: [(4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (6, 6)]. **DEAD**.\n4. **RIGHT (9, 3):**\n   *   (9, 3) is a segment of my body. **DEAD**.\n\nOnly safe move is UP (8, 4).\n\n**4. Execute Move**\nThe only safe move is UP. This also progresses toward the priority target A2 (9, 8).\n\n**5. Long-term Plan (Seeking A2 at (9, 8))**\nCurrent Head: (8, 3).\nT35: UP (8, 4). Length 10.\nT36 (from 8, 4):\n    *   DOWN (8, 3): Body. DEAD.\n    *   LEFT (7, 4): S1 body segment (7, 4). DEAD.\n    *   RIGHT (9, 4): My body segment (9, 4). DEAD.\n    *   UP (8, 5): Safe.\nT37 (from 8, 5):\n    *   DOWN (8, 4): Body. DEAD.\n    *   LEFT (7, 5): S1 body segment (7, 5). DEAD.\n    *   RIGHT (9, 5): My body segmen (9, 5). *This is the tail, and since I will not have eaten at T35 or T36, (9, 5) will be free.*\n    *   UP (8, 6): Safe.\n\nIf I rely blindly on the UP path (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7), (8, 8), I can reach (8, 8) by T39, and then move RIGHT to (9, 8) at T40 to eat A2.\n\nAlternative at T37: Move RIGHT to (9, 5), which is currently my tail.\n(9, 5) is my tail at T35.\nIf I move (8, 3) -> (8, 4) at T35. Tail moves from (9, 5) to (9, 4).\nIf I move (8, 4) -> (8, 5) at T36. Tail moves from (9, 4) to (9, 3).\nIf I am at (8, 5) at T37, I can move RIGHT to (9, 5). (9, 5) is safe (not T36/T37 body segment, nor is it the current T37 tail). Wait, if T36 tail is (9, 3), then (9, 4) and (9, 5) are free.\n\nLet's check the board (T35):\nMy body: [(8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9,",
