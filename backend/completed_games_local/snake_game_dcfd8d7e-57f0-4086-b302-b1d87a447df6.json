Eliminated.\n- **UP (7, 3):** Safe (empty). Keeps options open. Moving up (7, 3) and then (7, 4) keeps me moving strictly vertically up the center column. This is a safe but passive route. I need to actively pursue apples to win.\n- **DOWN (7, 1):** Safe (empty). This moves me directly down towards the apples at (6, 1) and (9, 1). However, moving to (7, 1) creates a body segment at (7, 2). From (7, 1), I can move LEFT to (6, 1) (eating an apple), RIGHT to (8, 1), or DOWN to (7, 0). Moving DOWN to (7, 0) is dangerous as it leads to a dead end at the corner (0, 0). By moving UP, I stay near the center and keep my tail behind me in the middle rows, preserving flexibility.\n- **LEFT (6, 2):** Safe (empty). This moves me closer to the apple at (6, 1) immediately (distance 1). From (6, 2), I can move DOWN to (6, 1) to eat. From (6, 2), I can also move UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. Moving LEFT from (6, 2) puts me at (5, 2), which is open space. This seems the most aggressive and efficient path to securing an apple. It puts me adjacent to (6, 1) and (5, 2) is open.\n\nDecision:\n**LEFT (6, 2)** is the best move. It aggressively targets the apple at (6, 1) (one step closer) and positions me at (6, 2) which is an open column with multiple valid moves. (6, 2) allows me to eat at (6, 1) next turn, or pivot to (5, 2) or (7, 2) (if tail moves). It is superior to UP which delays apple acquisition, and safer than DOWN which forces a narrow path.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (6, 1):** Contains an apple (A). Eating it is safe. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT (5, 2):** Empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (7, 2):** My body (tail) is currently at (7, 2). The tail moves *after* I move. However, (7, 2) is currently occupied by my body. Moving into a cell occupied by my own body is fatal. **RIGHT is unsafe.**\n\n2.  **Analyze Strategic Value & Future Safety:**\n    *   **Move DOWN (6, 1):** This eats the apple at (6, 1). My new body will be (6, 2) -> (7, 2). This is a safe, greedy move. It clears the apple and grows my length.\n    *   **Move LEFT (5, 2):** Moves towards (5, 3) or (5, 1). (5, 1) is empty. (4, 2) is empty. This keeps me in the open but doesn't grab the nearby apple.\n    *   **Move UP (6, 3):** Moves towards the enemy. Enemy 1 is at (6, 9). (6, 4) through (6, 8) are empty. If Enemy 1 moves down, we could collide if I move up. (6, 3) is safe now, but moving up aligns me with the enemy.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Eating the apple at (6, 1) is the immediate priority. It is safe, increases my score, and extends my body, making it slightly safer (longer tail).\n    *   Waiting or moving towards the enemy is unnecessary when an apple is adjacent and safe.\n\nI will move DOWN to eat the apple at (6, 1).\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 1):** This cell is currently occupied by my own body. The rule states: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" Furthermore, moving backwards is explicitly prohibited. This move is fatal.\n\nNow I must check for traps (future suicide) among the safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT):\n\n*   **If I go UP to (5, 2):** My body becomes [(5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)] (assuming the tail at (7, 2) moves). The exits are (5, 3), (4, 2), (6, 2). (6, 2) will be my body, but I have other exits. This is safe.\n*   **If I go DOWN to (5, 0):** My body becomes [(5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2)]. The only neighbor not occupied by my body is (4, 0). While (6, 0) is currently empty, it will become occupied by my body's tail or remain empty, but the only guaranteed immediate exit for the next turn from (5, 0) is (4, 0).

My body is at [(5, 1), (6, 1)]\"), but the ASCII board clearly shows my head at (3, 1) with a body segment at (4, 1). I will trust the ASCII board as the primary source of truth for positions, as it is the visual map of the game.\n\nBoard Analysis:\n- My Head: (3, 1)\n- My Body: [(4, 1), (5, 1)]\n- Apples: (2, 7), (1, 5), (9, 1), (1, 8), (7, 1)\n- Enemy Snake #1: Head at (2, 9), Body at (3, 9)\n\nAvailable Moves:\n1.  **UP to (3, 2):** Empty. Safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 0):** Empty. Safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 1):** Empty. Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 1):** Occupied by my own body. **Unsafe**.\n\nStrategy:\nI need to move towards apples. The apples at (2, 7), (1, 5), and (1, 8) are in the upper-left area. The apples at (7, 1) and (9, 1) are on the bottom right row.\n\nMoving **LEFT** to (2, 1) puts me closer to the apple cluster on the left. However, looking at the board, there is an apple at (7, 1). My body extends to (5, 1). If I move **RIGHT** to (4, 1), that is into my body, so I can't. But if I move **UP** or **DOWN**, I can potentially turn around and get the (7, 1) apple? No, (7, 1) is to the right. My body is blocking the direct path.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the apple at (7, 1).\nMy head is at (3, 1). To get to (7, 1), I need to go Right. My body is at (4, 1) and (5, 1). The path is currently blocked by my own body. I cannot go Right.\n\nMy only safe options are UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n- **LEFT (2, 1):** Moves towards the left-side apples. This seems like the most promising direction for future growth.\n- **UP (3, 2):** Moves towards the top-left apples.\n- **DOWN (3, 0):** Moves away from the apples, towards the bottom wall. Less optimal.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT, LEFT puts me at x=2, which is closer to the apples at (1, 5) and (2, 7) than staying at x=3. It also opens up the possibility of moving to (1, 1) in the next turn.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

This is a high-value target.\n    *   **RIGHT** takes me to (1, 2), which is empty but does not give an apple.\n    *   I must evaluate if **UP** is dangerous given the simultaneous movement.\n        *   Enemy head at (2, 7). Distance to (0, 3) is huge. No collision risk.\n        *   My body is safe. I will grow. My tail will stay at (1,1) or (0,1) depending on if I eat.

From (1,2), I can head towards (1,5) or (2,7).\n    *   Going **UP** secures a point and moves me away from the enemy (who is at X=2).\n    *   The move **UP** is safe and efficient.\n\n    *Re-checking Down*: (0,1) is the tail.

The cell to my Right (1,2) is empty.\n    The cell Up (0,3) is an Apple.\n    The cell Down (0,1) is my tail.\n\n    I will choose **UP**.\n\n    *Final check on enemy*: Snake #1 is at (2,7). It is moving. It sees an apple at (7,7). It will likely go RIGHT. Even if it comes LEFT, it won't reach me this turn.\n\n    **Plan**: Move UP to eat the apple at (0,3).

This is my current body segment. Moving backwards causes self-collision. Dead.\n    *   **RIGHT**: Target (1, 5). This is the position of Enemy Snake #1's head from the previous turn. In simultaneous movement, assuming the enemy does not commit suicide, they will move out of this cell. However, they could move into (1, 5) from another direction or stay if they moved into their own tail (unlikely). More importantly, Enemy Snake #1 is at (1, 6), poised to move down. A collision with a rival head is fatal. I should avoid moving directly toward the enemy head if possible. It is safer to move away or perpendicular. Moving UP moves away from the enemy head (distance increases from 1 to 2).\n\n2.  **Strategic Analysis**:\n    *   **Goal**: Reach 50 apples. I have 3, the enemy has 4.\n    *   **Apple Proximity**: I am right next to an apple at (0, 5). Moving UP takes it.\n    *   **Future Safety**: My current body occupies the column 0 from y=2 to y=4. Moving UP to (0, 6) clears the space behind me. The space below is tight. Moving UP keeps me on the edge, which is generally safer and opens up the top of the board.\n    *   **Conflict Avoidance**: The enemy is at (1, 6). If I move UP to (0, 6) and they move LEFT, we collide. However, they are currently moving based on the previous state where my head was at (0, 4). They likely see me as being below them. Moving UP puts me in a position to potentially cut them off or simply take the apple and pivot. If I move RIGHT to (1, 5), I am stepping into where the enemy head might be moving if they go LEFT, or moving towards their body. Staying on the edge (UP) maximizes my maneuverability for the next turn (I will have options: UP, RIGHT, or DOWN into the cleared space).\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: **UP** is the optimal move. It secures the apple at (0, 5), grows the snake, avoids immediate self-collision, and maintains a safe distance from the enemy head located at (1, 6). It also preserves the ability to turn Right towards the cluster of apples on the right side of the board on subsequent turns.\n**END RATIONALE**\nUP",

If I need to turn right later, I can do so from (0, 7) or (0, 8).\n    *   If I move **RIGHT** to (1, 6), my body will shift to (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4). This leaves the tail at (0, 3).
