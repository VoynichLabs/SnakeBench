We're at (4, 9) and the enemy is at (6, 6). Both of us are just heads right now, no bodies to worry about. The board is wide open, and we've got plenty of apples to go after.\n\nOur objective is clear: we need to box in the enemy and force a collision. But right now, we're both small, so we need to grow and dominate the board. Let's think about our options:\n\n1. **UP**: Can't go up, we're already at the top of the board (y=9).\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down to (4, 8). This keeps us safe and gives us some room to maneuver.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left to (3, 9). Also safe, but we're at the edge of the board.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right to (5, 9). Safe, but we're moving towards the enemy.\n\nNow, let's think about the enemy's possible moves. They're at (6, 6), so they can move up, down, left, or right. If we move down to (4, 8), we're creating some space between us and the enemy. This gives us room to grow and potentially cut off their movement later.\n\nIf we move right to (5, 9), we're getting closer to the enemy, but we're also risking a head-on collision if they move up. Since we're both at 0 apples, a head-on collision would be a double KO, and that's not what we want. We need to be smart and avoid unnecessary risks.\n\nMoving left to (3, 9) is safe, but it doesn't give us much advantage. We're still at the edge of the board, and we're not really pressuring the enemy.\n\nSo, the best move right now is to go DOWN to (4, 8). This keeps us safe, gives us room to grow, and sets us up for future moves to box in the enemy.\n\nLet's do this, chat! We're going DOWN!\n\nDOWN",

We need to be careful not to crash into them.\n\nOur objective is clear: we need to grow and dominate the board. Let's think about our options:\n\n1. **UP**: Moving up to (4, 8). This keeps us safe and gives us some room to maneuver.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down to (4, 6). This brings us closer to the enemy, but we need to be careful.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left to (3, 7). Safe, but we're moving away from the enemy.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right to (5, 7). This brings us closer to the enemy, but we're also risking a head-on collision if they move left.

We need to be careful not to crash into them.\n\nOur objective is clear: we need to grow and dominate the board. Let's think about our options:\n\n1. **UP**: Moving up to (4, 9). This is safe and keeps us away from the enemy.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down to (4, 7). This keeps us safe and gives us some room to maneuver.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left to (3, 8). Safe, but we're moving away from the enemy.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right to (5, 8). This brings us closer to the enemy, but we're also risking a head-on collision if they move up. Since we're both at 0 apples, a head-on collision would be a double KO, and that's not what we want. We need to be smart and avoid unnecessary risks.\n\nMoving left to (3, 8) is safe, but it doesn't give us much advantage.

Heads toward the apple column at (6,7) & (6,8).  \n  *Cons*: No immediate apple; we waste a turn while the opponent could still snag an apple near (3,8).  \n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,5)  \n  *Pros*: Moves us leftward, inching closer to the opponent\u2019s zone; keeps three exits next turn.  \n  *Cons*: No apple now; we miss an easy growth opportunity.  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,5) **APPLE**  \n  *Pros*: Immediate +1 length, reinforcing our lead. Gives us a solid 9\u2011segment body that the opponent can\u2019t match quickly.  \n  *Cons*: After the move only **UP** and **RIGHT** remain safe (two exits), but that\u2019s still enough with our length edge.  \n\n**\ud83d\udca1 Decision** \u2013 **RIGHT**.  \nWe snatch the apple at (7,5) now, expanding our lead while staying alive.

We're at (4, 6) and the enemy is at (7, 6) with a body at (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4). We're still just a head, but the enemy has a body segment. We need to be careful not to crash into them.\n\nOur objective is clear: we need to grow and dominate the board. Let's think about our options:\n\n1. **UP**: Moving up to (4, 7). This is safe and keeps us away from the enemy.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down to (4, 5). This keeps us safe and gives us some room to maneuver.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left to (3, 6). Safe, but we're moving away from the enemy.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right to (5, 6). This brings us closer to the enemy, but we're also risking a head-on collision if they move left. Since we're both at 0 apples, a head-on collision would be a double KO, and that's not what we want. We need to be smart and avoid unnecessary risks.\n\nMoving left to (3, 6) is safe, but it doesn't give us much advantage. We're still at the edge of the board, and we're not really pressuring the enemy.\n\nSo, the best move right now is to go UP to (4, 7). This keeps us safe, gives us room to grow, and sets us up for future moves to box in the enemy.\n\nLet's do this, chat! We're going UP!\n\nUP",

Only **UP** and **LEFT** remain viable next turn \u2013 a tighter corridor.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,6)** also leaves three options, but pushes us toward the right edge. We\u2019ll soon have the wall at x\u202f=\u202f9 limiting future maneuvers, and the opponent is left\u2011side anyway, so no immediate benefit.\n\n**\u2694\ufe0f Aggressive plan**\n\n1. **Turn\u202f15** \u2013 **UP** to (7,7).  \n2. **Turn\u202f16** \u2013 **LEFT** to (6,7) to grab the apple at (6,7).  \n3.

When we\u2019re long enough, force a head\u2011on (our 8\u202fapples vs\u202f0 guarantees victory).\n\n**\u2705 Decision:** the UP move gives us the best mix of safety, future flexibility, and a quick apple.\n\nUP",

We need to be smart and avoid unnecessary risks.\n\nMoving left to (3, 8) is safe, but it doesn't give us much advantage. We're still at the edge of the board, and we're not really pressuring the enemy.\n\nSo, the best move right now is to go UP to (4, 9).

If they move away it\u2019s okay, but if they move into our old spot (5,8) we could end up in a head\u2011swap situation that\u2019s risky.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,8) \u2013 our own body segment \u2192 instant death.  \n\n**What the opponent might do**  \nThe rival will likely go for the juicy apple at **(3,8)** by moving LEFT, or maybe UP/DOWN to stay alive. None of those choices threaten a direct head\u2011on collision with us unless we deliberately move LEFT into their current cell, which feels like gambling.\n\n**Strategic aim**  \nWe want to keep the arena open, avoid any chance of swapping heads, and stay in a position where we can later swing left to corner them. Heading **DOWN** does exactly that:  \n- It stays away from the top edge.  \n- It gives us a corridor of free cells (row\u202f7) to weave around.  \n- It doesn\u2019t walk into the opponent\u2019s immediate path, so we stay alive this turn and set up future pressure.\n\nSo the safest, most flexible move right now is to slip down one step and keep the pressure on. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude80  \n\n**Move:**  \n\nDOWN",

From there, swing right\u2011ward to corner the opponent against the top wall while my long tail blocks any escape.\n\nLet\u2019s grab that apple and lock him down!  \n\nUP",

We're still just a head and one body segment, but the enemy has a massive body. We need to be careful not to crash into them.\n\nOur objective is clear: we need to grow and dominate the board. Let's think about our options:\n\n1. **UP**: Moving up to **(4, 9)**. This is safe and gives us some room to maneuver.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down to **(4, 7)**. This is unsafe because the enemy's body is at **(4, 7)**.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left to **(3, 8)**. This is unsafe because the enemy's body is at **(3, 8)**.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right to **(5, 8)**. This is unsafe because the enemy's body is at **(5, 8)**.\n\nMoving up to **(4, 9)** is safe and gives us some room to grow. It also keeps us close to the enemy, so we can pressure them.\n\nSo, the best move right now is to go **UP** to **(4, 9)**.

No immediate clash either way.\n\n**Strategic call**  \n- Grabbing the apple at (0,5) is tempting, but it pins me to the wall and cuts future routes (I\u2019d lose the ability to go back up).  \n- Heading **RIGHT** keeps me mobile, lets me swing toward the centre, and still lets me scoop the apple at (1,5) on the next move if I want.  \n- More mobility = more ways to cut off that little snake later, and reduces the risk of trapping myself.\n\nSo the aggressive, forward\u2011thinking play is to **move RIGHT** and stay flexible.\n\n**Decision:**  \n\nRIGHT",

Let's break down this situation and make a **POWER MOVE**!\n\nFirst, let's look at the board. We're at **(4, 8)** and the enemy is at **(1, 6)** with a body at **[(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6)]**. We're still just a head and one body segment, but the enemy has a massive body. We need to be careful not to crash into them.\n\nOur objective is clear: we need to grow and dominate the board. Let's think about our options:\n\n1. **UP**: Moving up to **(4, 9)**. This is safe and gives us some room to maneuver.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down to **(4, 7)**. This is unsafe because it's into the enemy's body.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left to **(3, 8)**. This is unsafe because it's into the enemy's body.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right to **(5, 8)**. This is unsafe because it's into the enemy's body.\n\nMoving up to **(4, 9)** is safe and gives us some room to grow. It also keeps us close to the enemy, so we can pressure them.\n\nSo, the best move right now is to go **UP** to **(4, 9)**. This keeps us safe, gives us room to grow, and sets us up for future moves to box in the enemy.\n\nLet's do this, chat! We're going **UP**!\n\nUP",

We're still just a head and one body segment, but the enemy has a massive body. We need to be careful not to crash into them.\n\nOur objective is clear: we need to grow and dominate the board. Let's think about our options:\n\n1. **UP**: Moving up to **(4, 10)**. This is unsafe because it's off the board.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down to **(4, 8)**. This is safe and gives us some room to maneuver.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left to **(3, 9)**. This is safe and moves us closer to the enemy.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right to **(5, 9)**. This is safe and moves us away from the enemy.\n\nMoving down to **(4, 8)** is a safe move and keeps us away from the enemy's body. It also gives us some room to grow and sets us up for future moves to box in the enemy.\n\nSo, the best move right now is to go **DOWN** to **(4, 8)**. This keeps us safe and sets us up for future moves to dominate the board.\n\nLet's do this, chat! We're going **DOWN**!\n\nDOWN",

We're still just a head and one body segment, but the enemy has a massive body. We need to be careful not to crash into them.\n\nOur objective is clear: we need to grow and dominate the board. Let's think about our options:\n\n1. **UP**: Moving up to **(4, 10)**. This is unsafe because it's off the board.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down to **(4, 8)**.

This is safe and moves us closer to the enemy's body.\n\nMoving down to **(4, 8)** is the best move right now.

The other three are safe.\n\n**Why DOWN is the best**\n1. **Apple now** \u2192 grow to 20 segments, extending our lead (19 \u2192 20).\n2. After eating, we\u2019ll have a **wide fan\u2011out**: from (3,2) we can go left to (2,2), right to (4,2) (another apple), or down to (3,1) (apple). Plenty of escape routes.\n3. It **doesn\u2019t box us in** \u2013 the lower\u2011left quadrant is still largely empty, giving us room to swing around and eventually corral the opponent.\n4. The opponent can\u2019t reach (3,2) this turn, so no head\u2011on risk.\n\n**Long\u2011term thought**\n- Keep hugging the bottom edge, scoop apples at (0,5), (1,2), (3,1) while the opponent battles for the top\u2011right area.\n- Once we\u2019ve secured the lower half, start looping around the right side to force the rival into a dead\u2011end near (4,8)/(4,9).\n\n**Decision:** Grab the apple, stay alive, stay aggressive.\n\nDOWN",

The column\u202f6 is a clear runway to the top row, letting us sweep the high\u2011value apples at (7,\u202f9), (8,\u202f9) and (9,\u202f9).\n3. **Safety**: No head\u2011on risk with the opponent (they\u2019re heading left on the opposite side). Upside\u2011down moves keep us away from our own tail and from the opponent\u2019s short body.\n\n**\ud83d\udca1 Short\u2011term plan**\n\n- **Turn\u202f45**: **UP** to (6,\u202f6) \u2192 eat the apple, grow.\n- **Turn\u202f46\u201148**: Keep moving **UP** to the top, then veer right to dominate the apple cluster while the opponent is stuck on the left wall.\n- Keep an eye on the opponent\u2019s limited space; we\u2019ll pressure them into the corner and force a fatal head\u2011on if they try to break out.\n\nLet\u2019s snatch that apple and stay aggressive! \ud83d\ude80  \n\nUP",

We need to be careful not to crash into them.\n\nOur objective is clear: we need to grow and dominate the board. Let's think about our options:\n\n1. **UP**: Moving up to **(2, 10)**. This is unsafe because it's off the board.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down to **(2, 8)**. This is unsafe because it's into the enemy's body.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left to **(1, 9)**. This is safe and moves us away from the enemy's body.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right to **(3, 9)**. This is unsafe because it's into our own body.\n\nMoving left to **(1, 9)** is the best move right now. It keeps us away from the enemy's body and gives us some room to maneuver.\n\nSo, the best move right now is to go **LEFT** to **(1, 9)**. This keeps us safe and sets us up for future moves to dominate the board.\n\nLet's do this, chat! We're going **LEFT**!\n\nLEFT",

We need to be careful not to crash into them.\n\nOur objective is clear: we need to grow and dominate the board. Let's think about our options:\n\n1. **UP**: Moving up to **(1, 10)**. This is unsafe because it's off the board.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving down to **(1, 8)**. This is unsafe because it's into the enemy's body.\n3. **LEFT**: Moving left to **(0, 9)**. This is safe and moves us away from the enemy's body.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moving right to **(2, 9)**. This is unsafe because it's into our own body.\n\nMoving left to **(0, 9)** is the best move right now. It keeps us away from the enemy's body and gives us some room to maneuver.\n\nSo, the best move right now is to go **LEFT** to **(0, 9)**. This keeps us safe and sets us up for future moves to dominate the board.\n\nLet's do this, chat! We're going **LEFT**!\n\nLEFT",

We need to think outside the box. Maybe we can move down to **(0, 8)** and hope the enemy moves away. But that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, we can move right to **(1, 9)** and hope we can grow and dominate the board. But that's also risky.\n\nChat, what's the play here? We need to make a decision. Let's go with moving right to **(1, 9)**. It's risky, but it's our best chance to grow and dominate the board.\n\nSo, the best move right now is to go **RIGHT** to **(1, 9)**.
