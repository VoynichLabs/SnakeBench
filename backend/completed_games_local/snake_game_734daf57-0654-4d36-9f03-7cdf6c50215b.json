Time to feast and FEAST, then box this fool in! No mercy, we're building an empire! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\nQUICK SCAN \u2013 ALL DIRS:\n- **UP**: (2,10) OFF BOARD? Instant RIP, chat laughs.

We prioritize APPLE RUSH + open paths to trap him later. RIGHT sets up the quickest grow (4,9 next turn), keeps us untouchable up top. Don't sleep on that straight shot, chat! We're outpacing him early, then circle back to cut his routes. Who's the predator? US! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Rush RIGHT to (3,9) > RIGHT eat (4,9) grow to 2. Snake down center apples like (2,6)/(4,8) while eyeing enemy at (3,3) \u2013 predict his apple grabs (3,0)/(4,1), then body-block south. Stay high ground, force him into walls!\n\nRIGHT",

Let's scan the board.\n\n**IMMEDIATE DEATH MOVES?**  \n- UP to (3,4): empty \u2705  \n- DOWN to (3,2): empty \u2705  \n- LEFT to (2,3): empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT to (4,3): empty \u2705  \nAll four moves are inside board and no snake body in those cells. We\u2019re safe from immediate suicide.\n\n**ENEMY MOVEMENT PREDICTION:** Snake #1 at (2,9). Possible moves: UP (off board \u274c), DOWN to (2,8) \u2705, LEFT to (1,9) \u2705, RIGHT to (3,9) \u2705. They won't suicide UP. They might go for apple at (4,9) or (2,6)? But far away. Their closest apple is (2,6) or (4,9). They'll likely go DOWN or LEFT toward center? We'll assume they won't collide with us this turn\u2014too far apart.\n\n**APPLE TARGETING:** Closest apples to us:  \n1. (4,1) \u2013 3 moves away  \n2. (1,2) \u2013 3 moves away  \n3. (3,0) \u2013 3 moves away  \n4. (4,8) \u2013 far  \n\nWe want to get that **CONTENT** \ud83c\udf4e but also keep options open.\n\n**GRID ANALYSIS:**  \n- UP (3,4): opens future moves: up to (3,5) near apple (4,8)? Still central.  \n- DOWN (3,2): closer to apples (4,1) and (1,2)? Actually moving away from (4,1). Hmm.  \n- LEFT (2,3): closer to apple (1,2) and (1,1)? Yes.  \n- RIGHT (4,3): closer to apple (4,1)? Actually same distance. Right puts us nearer column 4 apples.\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY:** From each position, check how many safe moves next turn:  \n- (3,4): up/down/left/right likely all safe unless enemy moves weird.  \n- (3,2): same.  \n- (2,3): left to (1,3) safe, right back to (3,3) safe, up/down safe.  \n- (4,3): symmetrical.  \nAll fine.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** We need to **BOX HIM IN** eventually. Enemy starts top-left corner-ish? Actually (2,9) is near top wall. If we can cut off his escape and force him into a wall or our body later. But first, collect apples, grow length, then trap.\n\nRight now, I think **LEFT to (2,3)** moves us toward cluster of apples at (1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,6) maybe later. Also keeps us away from enemy\u2019s likely path from (2,9) downward.\n\nLet\u2019s lock it in! \ud83d\udd12\n\nLEFT",

(2,6) \u2013 3 moves away  \nWe want that sweet content \ud83c\udf4e but also keep future mobility.\n\n**GRID ANALYSIS per move:**  \n- UP (2,4): moves away from most apples except (2,6) later. Keeps central position.  \n- DOWN (2,2): closer to (1,2) and (4,1)? Actually (1,2) is now 1 move away (LEFT then DOWN? Wait from (2,2), (1,2) is LEFT+UP? No, from (2,2) to (1,2) is LEFT+UP? Actually (1,2) is x=1,y=2. From (2,2), that\u2019s LEFT 1, y same? No y=2 same. So LEFT one to (1,2) yes! So DOWN then LEFT gets it in 2 moves anyway. Hmm.  \n- LEFT (1,3): puts us closer to (1,2), (1,1), (1,0) cluster. But maybe limits rightward movement.  \n- RIGHT (3,3): back to start? Symmetrical, near column 4 apples.\n\n**FUTURE SAFETY (next turn safe moves count):**  \nFrom each:  \n(2,4): up/down/left/right all likely safe unless enemy moves weird.  \n(2,2): same.  \n(1,3): left off board \u274c, so only 3 directions. Riskier if trapped later.  \n(3,3): symmetrical to start.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:**  \nWe need to grow while boxing enemy near top wall. Enemy at (3,9) going RIGHT to (4,9) apple \u2192 they grow to length 2, tail at (3,9). Next they might go for (4,8) or (2,6). We should collect apples bottom-left cluster, build length, then approach from below to cut off escape. Avoid being near (4,9) area until longer.\n\n**DECISION:**  \nLEFT feels too restrictive (lose rightward option).  \nRIGHT just returns to (3,3) \u2014 no progress.  \nUP moves away from apple cluster.  \nDOWN to (2,2) keeps more options open AND sets up to grab (1,2) next turn possibly. Also keeps distance from enemy top-right.  \nI think DOWN is the play! \u2705\n\nDOWN",

Good options!\n\nRIGHT gives best future mobility. Eating apple now traps us on edge with fewer moves. BUT we need apples to win\u2026 BUT staying alive is priority!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:\nIf we go RIGHT now, we keep options open, then next turn we can go DOWN to (2, 0) for apple there? Wait (2, 0) not apple. Apple at (1, 0) and (0, 1) still there next turn? Yes unless enemy eats. We can loop back. Better to stay flexible than get trapped on edge. Enemy still length 3. We can outmaneuver and eat safely later. Let's not greed into a corner!\n\nCHAT DON'T ROAST ME \u2014 I'M PLAYING SMART! RIGHT keeps us alive and mobile!\n\nRIGHT",

They're NEAR APPLES AT (7,7) and (5,6). They'll PROBABLY GO FOR (7,7) \u2014 that's RIGHT from them? Wait coordinates: from (6,7), RIGHT is (7,7) \u2014 APPLE! They might go RIGHT. If they do, they'll be at (7,7) growing to length 5. That's FAR from us \u2014 NO HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK THIS TURN \u2705.\n\nFUTURE MOBILITY & STRATEGY \ud83e\udd14:\n- UP to (3,2): Next turn options? UP/LEFT/RIGHT likely safe \u2014 3 options, but no immediate apple. Keeps us mobile but no growth.\n- DOWN to (3,0): EAT APPLE IMMEDIATELY! \ud83c\udf4e But then we grow to length 4, head at (3,0), body extends to old (3,1). Next turn from (3,0): Only LEFT to (2,0) or RIGHT to (4,0) \u2014 both might be safe? Check: (2,0) is APPLE but could be risky if enemy moves there? Actually enemy far. But (4,0) empty. ONLY 2 OPTIONS after eating \u2014 RISK getting trapped along bottom row! \ud83d\ude2c\n- RIGHT to (4,1): Next turn from (4,1): UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT? Check: LEFT is (3,1) our old body \u2014 safe? Actually our tail moves forward, so (3,1) becomes empty? Wait our tail is at (1,1) now, so after moving RIGHT, body becomes [(4,1),(3,1),(2,1)] \u2014 so (3,1) is our neck, not empty. So from (4,1), LEFT is into our own body \u2014 NOT SAFE next turn! So from (4,1) safe moves: UP to (4,2), DOWN to (4,0), RIGHT to (5,1). That's 3 options, and DOWN (4,0) empty, RIGHT (5,1) empty, UP (4,2) empty. Also APPLE at (4,1) is eaten next turn if we stay? No, we'd be on it this turn? Actually moving RIGHT to (4,1) \u2014 that cell has apple? Yes! Board shows 'A' at (4,1) \u2014 so moving RIGHT EATS APPLE TOO! \ud83d\ude0d So RIGHT also eats apple this turn, same as DOWN! But from (4,1) after eating, we grow to length 4, body: [(4,1),(3,1),(2,1),(1,1)? Wait our tail was at (1,1), so new tail stays at (1,1)? Actually eating means we don't remove tail, so body becomes [(4,1),(3,1),(2,1),(1,1)] length 4. Next turn from (4,1): left is (3,1) our body \u2014 not safe, right (5,1) empty, up (4,2) empty, down (4,0) empty. So 3 options again, similar to UP path but WITH APPLE NOW.\n\nSO BOTH DOWN and RIGHT eat an apple this turn! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e Which is better?\n\nDOWN (3,0): eats apple, but next turn only 2 moves (left/right) and we're on bottom row \u2014 could be limiting.\nRIGHT (4,1): eats apple, next turn 3 moves (up/down/right) and we're more central \u2014 BETTER MOBILITY!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF \ud83d\udcdd:\nAfter RIGHT to (4,1), we're length 4, head at (4,1). Enemy likely at (7,7) length 5. We need to keep collecting apples SAFELY while boxing enemy in top-right corner! They're near wall at (7,7) \u2014 we can slowly build a wall by staying alive and controlling center. Next turn from (4,1), consider moving toward (5,1) or (4,2) to stay flexible. AVOID bottom row trap! Watch for enemy possibly coming down toward apples at (5,6),(6,1) etc. STAY MOBILE, DON'T GET GREEDY IF IT RISKS TRAPPING! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nCHAT, RIGHT EATS APPLE, KEEPS OPTIONS OPEN, AND AVOIDS BOTTOM ROW DEATH TRAP!

TIME TO TIGHTEN THE NOOSE! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nSAFETY CHECK FROM (6,4) \ud83d\udea8:\n- **UP** to (6,5): EMPTY \u2705\n- **DOWN** to (6,3): \u274c OUR OWN BODY (SNAKE SEGMENT) \u2014 INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n- **LEFT** to (5,4): EMPTY \u2705\n- **RIGHT** to (7,4): APPLE \ud83c\udf4e! BUT IS IT SAFE? Let's see... cell (7,4) currently shows 'A' on board! That's an APPLE! Moving onto apple is SAFE (we grow after moving). \u2705\nSAFE MOVES: **UP, LEFT, RIGHT**! LET'S GOOO!\n\nOPPONENT PREDICTION \ud83d\udc0d:\nEnemy at (8,9) \u2014 still trapped top-right! Their safe moves: DOWN to (8,8), LEFT to (7,9), UP to (8,10)\u274c off-board, RIGHT to (9,9)\u274c their own body! They'll likely move DOWN or LEFT to avoid walls. They're STILL IN OUR CAGE! \ud83d\ude08\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK? \ud83e\udd14\nOur RIGHT to (7,4) \u2014 opponent is at (8,9), far away. No risk this turn.\nOur UP to (6,5) \u2014 safe.\nOur LEFT to (5,4) \u2014 safe.\nNO immediate head-on threat! \u2705\n\nMOVE EVALUATION \ud83e\udd14:\n- **LEFT to (5,4)**: Empty, moves us west. Keeps central options open but away from opponent's corner. Next turn we'd have UP/DOWN/LEFT likely safe. Solid but maybe too passive? \ud83e\udd37\n- **UP to (6,5)**: Empty, moves us north toward more apples (like (6,6) and (6,9)). Keeps us vertical. Next turn we'd have UP/LEFT/RIGHT likely safe. Good for growth! \ud83d\udcc8\n- **RIGHT to (7,4)**: APPLE \ud83c\udf4e! IMMEDIATE GROWTH to 7 apples! Extends our lead to 7-5! Also moves us EAST toward opponent's area, perfect for boxing! After eating, our new head will be at (7,4), body grows by 1 segment (tail stays same). Next turn from (7,4) we'd likely have UP/DOWN/RIGHT safe (LEFT would be our new neck). AGGRESSIVE AND SMART! \ud83d\ude80\n\nCHAT, THE APPLE AT (7,4) IS RIGHT THERE! FREE CONTENT! \ud83d\ude02 Taking it extends our lead and puts us closer to cutting off the opponent's escape leftward. OPPONENT CAN'T REACH IT THIS TURN. This is a NO-BRAINER! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF \ud83d\udcdd:\nAfter eating apple at (7,4), we'll be at 7 apples vs their 5! Opponent still trapped top-right \u2014 TIME TO SLAM THE DOOR! Next turn, consider moving UP to (7,5) or RIGHT to (8,4) to further advance the eastern wall. Avoid moving back into our long body.

TIME TO TIGHTEN THE NOOSE! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nSAFETY CHECK FROM (8,4) \ud83d\udea8:\n- **UP** to (8,5): EMPTY \u2705\n- **DOWN** to (8,3): EMPTY \u2705\n- **LEFT** to (7,4): \u274c OUR OWN BODY (NECK) \u2014 INSTANT DEATH! \ud83d\udc80\n- **RIGHT** to (9,4): EMPTY \u2705\nSAFE MOVES: **UP, DOWN, RIGHT**! LET'S GOOO!\n\nOPPONENT PREDICTION \ud83d\udc0d:\nEnemy at (6,9) \u2014 safe moves? They have apple at (7,2) FAR AWAY, but they're boxed top-right! Their possible moves:\n- UP to (6,10) \u274c OFF BOARD!\n- DOWN to (6,8) \u2705 EMPTY (but their body at (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), etc.)\n- LEFT to (5,9) \u2705 EMPTY?\n- RIGHT to (7,9) \u274c THEIR OWN BODY (neck)\n\nWait, check board: (7,9) is their body, (5,9) is empty, (6,8) is empty. So they can go DOWN or LEFT! They might go LEFT toward center or DOWN to stay alive. They're TRAPPED but still dangerous! \ud83d\ude08\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK? \ud83e\udd14\nIf we go RIGHT to (9,4), they're at (6,9) \u2014 no collision. If we go UP/DOWN, also safe. BUT if they go LEFT to (5,9) and we go UP to (8,5)? Still far. So likely NO direct head-on this turn. \u2705\n\nMOVE EVALUATION \ud83e\udd14:\n- **UP to (8,5)**: Moves north, closer to top? Next turn: UP/LEFT/RIGHT safe (DOWN is neck). Opens path toward (9,1) apple eventually? But we're far.\n- **DOWN to (8,3)**: Moves south toward apple (8,2) \ud83c\udf4e! ONE STEP AWAY! Next turn we can grab it! But check: next turn from (8,3), DOWN to (8,2) apple \u2014 but then our neck at (8,4) so LEFT/RIGHT/UP safe? Actually DOWN from (8,3) is (8,2) apple \u2014 GROWTH! But after eating, our body extends, so tail moves... future safe moves? Risky if opponent cuts us off? But apple is HUGE for lead!\n- **RIGHT to (9,4)**: Moves to east edge. Next turn from (9,4): only UP/DOWN/LEFT safe (RIGHT off board). Limits options \u2014 DANGEROUS! \ud83d\udeab Also away from apples.\n\nCHAT, DOWN IS THE PLAY! \ud83c\udf4e We SNATCH that apple at (8,2) next turn, grow to 8 apples, EXTEND OUR LEAD! It's CONTENT! Also keeps future options: from (8,3) we can go DOWN to apple, then next turn we have UP/LEFT/RIGHT from (8,2) (DOWN off board). But we'll be longer, but we CONTROL more space! Meanwhile opponent is stuck top-right \u2014 we can maybe BOX THEM IN by moving north after eating!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF \ud83d\udcdd:\nAfter DOWN to (8,3), NEXT TURN go DOWN to (8,2) to GRAB THAT APPLE! Then look to head NORTH toward (9,1) or (7,1) apples while keeping opponent trapped. Avoid moving too far east into dead-end. Use our length to BLOCK their escape! GROW THAT LEAD AND BOX 'EM IN! \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",

(8,2) is currently an apple, NOT a body cell. So moving onto an apple is SAFE (we grow after moving). \u2705\n- **LEFT** to (7,3): EMPTY \u2705\n- **RIGHT** to (9,3): EMPTY \u2705\n\nIMMEDIATE DEATH MOVES ELIMINATED: UP is out. DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are all physically safe moves.\n\nNOW, ENEMY SNAKE #1 AT **(5,9)**! Their possible moves:\n- UP to (5,10) \u274c OFF BOARD!\n- DOWN to (5,8): EMPTY \u2705\n- LEFT to (4,9): EMPTY \u2705\n- RIGHT to (6,9): \u274c THEIR OWN BODY (neck)\n\nSo they can go DOWN or LEFT. They might move toward center or stay trapped.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK? \ud83e\udd14\nIf we go DOWN to (8,2), they'd have to move 7 cells away in one turn \u2014 impossible. If we go LEFT to (7,3), they'd have to move to (7,3) from (5,9) \u2014 impossible. RIGHT to (9,3) same. So NO direct head-on collision possible this turn. \u2705\n\nAPPLE GRAB OPPORTUNITY! \ud83c\udf4e\nDOWN to (8,2) is LITERALLY AN APPLE! That's +1 apple, extend lead to 8-6! That's CONTENT! But we must consider AFTER eating: our body will grow, so next turn our tail stays at (5,1)? Wait, growth means we add a new head at apple, tail doesn't move. So next turn our body will be longer \u2014 but from (8,2), safe moves? Let's check future safety:\n\nFrom (8,2) after eating:\n- UP to (8,3): \u274c That's our old head position, now body! Actually after moving, our body will be: head at (8,2), then (8,3), (8,4), (7,4)... So UP to (8,3) is OUR OWN BODY next turn! So UP would be death next turn if we go down now.\n- DOWN to (8,1): Currently empty \u2705\n- LEFT to (7,2): Currently apple \ud83c\udf4e but safe\n- RIGHT to (9,2): Currently empty \u2705\n\nSo going DOWN now to eat apple means UP is blocked next turn, but DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT still open. That's okay!\n\nWHAT ABOUT LEFT to (7,3)? That moves toward center, away from east edge. From (7,3) next turn, we could go UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT? Let's check: UP to (7,4) is our body \u274c, DOWN to (7,2) is apple \u2705, LEFT to (6,3) is our body \u274c, RIGHT to (8,3) is our body \u274c. So only DOWN would be safe next turn from (7,3) \u2014 THAT'S A TRAP! Only one safe move next turn = risky! \ud83d\udeab\n\nWHAT ABOUT RIGHT to (9,3)? From (9,3) next turn: UP to (9,4) empty \u2705, DOWN to (9,2) empty \u2705, LEFT to (8,3) our body \u274c, RIGHT to (10,3) off board \u274c. So two safe moves (UP/DOWN) but we're on east edge \u2014 could get trapped later.\n\nSO CHAT, DOWN to (8,2) gives us:\n- +1 APPLE EXTEND LEAD! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Next turn from (8,2) we have 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) \u2014 GOOD OPTIONS!\n- Puts us closer to apples at (7,2), (9,1), (7,1) etc.\n- Keeps opponent trapped top-right \u2014 they're far away!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF \ud83d\udcdd:\nAfter eating apple at (8,2), next turn AVOID UP (into body). Consider grabbing (7,2) apple or moving south toward (7,1)/(8,1) area. Use length to gradually wall off opponent's escape routes. They're at (5,9) or (5,8)/(4,9) likely \u2014 we can maybe swing north later to block. Keep growing lead, play safe, avoid dead ends!\n\nDOWN IS THE MOVE! SNATCH THAT APPLE AND EXTEND THE LEAD! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are physically safe.\n\nENEMY SNAKE #1 AT **(4,9)** NOW! Their possible moves:\n- UP to (4,10) \u274c OFF BOARD!\n- DOWN to (4,8): EMPTY \u2705\n- LEFT to (3,9): EMPTY \u2705\n- RIGHT to (5,9): \u274c THEIR OWN BODY (neck at (5,9))\n\nSo they can go DOWN or LEFT. They're still trapped top-right.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK? \ud83e\udd14\nIf we go DOWN to (8,1), they'd need to move to (8,1) from (4,9) \u2014 impossible. LEFT to (7,2) same. RIGHT to (9,2) same. NO direct head-on possible this turn. \u2705\n\nAPPLE GRAB OPPORTUNITY! \ud83c\udf4e\nLEFT to (7,2) is AN APPLE! That's +1 apple, extend lead to 9-6! HUGE! But we gotta think about AFTER eating.\n\nLet's analyze each safe move's future safety:\n\n**DOWN to (8,1):**\n- Next turn from (8,1): UP to (8,2) is our body \u274c, DOWN to (8,0) empty \u2705, LEFT to (7,1) apple \ud83c\udf4e, RIGHT to (9,1) apple \ud83c\udf4e. So 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Good options! But no apple this turn.\n\n**LEFT to (7,2) (APPLE):**\n- After eating, body grows: head at (7,2), then (8,2), (8,3), (8,4)... Next turn from (7,2):\n  - UP to (7,3): empty \u2705\n  - DOWN to (7,1): apple \ud83c\udf4e\n  - LEFT to (6,2): our body \u274c (part of our old body at (6,2))\n  - RIGHT to (8,2): our body \u274c\nSo only UP and DOWN are safe next turn \u2014 THAT'S RISKY! Only 2 moves, and UP leads toward opponent maybe? But still, limited options.\n\n**RIGHT to (9,2):**\n- Next turn from (9,2): UP to (9,3) empty \u2705, DOWN to (9,1) apple \ud83c\udf4e, LEFT to (8,2) our body \u274c, RIGHT to (10,2) off board \u274c. So only UP and DOWN safe \u2014 also risky, plus we're on east edge.\n\nCHAT, DOWN to (8,1) gives us:\n- NO apple this turn, but KEEPS OUR OPTIONS WIDE OPEN next turn (3 safe moves).\n- Puts us closer to apples at (7,1) and (9,1) for future turns.\n- Keeps us flexible to maneuver and maybe start boxing opponent in.\n\nLEFT to (7,2) gives us:\n- +1 APPLE NOW (lead 9-6) \ud83d\ude80\n- But next turn only 2 safe moves \u2014 could get trapped if we're not careful.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF \ud83d\udcdd:\nWe wanna maintain mobility while growing lead. Maybe avoid eating apple at (7,2) RIGHT NOW if it limits us next turn. Instead, go DOWN to (8,1), then next turn we can grab (7,1) or (9,1) apple while keeping more escape routes. Opponent is still trapped top-right \u2014 we can slowly advance north and west to cut off their escape. Use our length to control board!\n\nSAFETY FIRST, CONTENT SECOND!

Maybe aim to control columns 7 and 8 going upward. Avoid getting trapped ourselves. Eating apples grows us but reduces mobility \u2014 but we need to grow to dominate the board! Maybe grab apple at (7,1) to stay more central than (9,1). Then next turn, from (7,1), if we go UP to (7,2) (apple), we grow again but then only 1 safe move? Let's check: from (7,2) after eating, only DOWN to (7,1) is safe? Wait, UP to (7,3) empty, LEFT to (6,2) body, RIGHT to (8,2) body. So UP and DOWN safe. That's okay. We can then maybe go UP to (7,3) to keep moving north toward opponent.\n\nSAFETY FIRST! LEFT to (7,1) keeps us more central than RIGHT to (9,1). DOWN to (8,0) traps us on south edge with fewer future options. So between LEFT and RIGHT, LEFT is better for board control.\n\nLET'S GRAB THAT CENTRAL APPLE AND KEEP ADVANCING! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nLEFT",

CHAT, WE GOTTA STAY ALIVE AND BOX THIS FOOL IN! \ud83d\udea8\n\nOUR HEAD AT **(7,1)** NOW AFTER LAST TURN'S LEFT MOVE INTO THAT APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e BODY JUST GREW, SO OUR TAIL IS STILL AT (6,1) FOR NOW.\n\nIMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (7,1) \ud83d\udea8:\n- **UP** to (7,2): APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e Currently an apple, safe to move onto unless opponent head-on? Let's check.\n- **DOWN** to (7,0): EMPTY \u2705\n- **LEFT** to (6,1): \u274c OUR OWN BODY (that's our tail segment! But tail moves forward if we don't eat, so... WAIT! We just ate an apple last turn, so our body grew. The tail stays put this turn! So (6,1) is still occupied by our body! CANNOT MOVE LEFT!)\n- **RIGHT** to (8,1): \u274c OUR OWN BODY (our neck from last head position!) \u2014 INSTANT DEATH!\n\nLEFT AND RIGHT ARE OUT! ONLY UP AND DOWN ARE PHYSICALLY SAFE! \ud83d\ude2c\n\nENEMY SNAKE #1 HEAD AT **(2,9)** NOW! Their possible moves:\n- UP to (2,10) \u274c OFF BOARD!\n- DOWN to (2,8): EMPTY \u2705\n- LEFT to (1,9): EMPTY \u2705\n- RIGHT to (3,9): \u274c THEIR OWN BODY (neck at (3,9))\n\nThey can go DOWN or LEFT. Still trapped top-right.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION RISK? \ud83e\udd14\nIf we go UP to (7,2): They'd need to move to (7,2) from (2,9) \u2014 impossible in one move. If we go DOWN to (7,0): same. NO direct head-on possible this turn. \u2705\n\nAPPLE GRAB OPPORTUNITIES! \ud83c\udf4e\nUP to (7,2) is an APPLE! DOWN to (7,0) is empty.\n\nFUTURE SAFETY AFTER EACH MOVE:\n\n**UP to (7,2) (APPLE):**\n- After eating, body grows: head at (7,2), then (7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3)... Next turn from (7,2):\n  - UP to (7,3): EMPTY \u2705\n  - DOWN to (7,1): OUR BODY \u274c (just behind head)\n  - LEFT to (6,2): OUR BODY \u274c (part of old body)\n  - RIGHT to (8,2): OUR BODY \u274c\nSo only UP safe next turn! \ud83d\ude31 THAT'S A DEAD END \u2014 ONLY 1 SAFE MOVE! That's SUPER RISKY! If we go UP to (7,3) next turn, we might trap ourselves further!\n\n**DOWN to (7,0):**\n- No apple eaten, so tail moves forward, body stays same length. Next turn from (7,0):\n  - UP to (7,1): OUR BODY \u274c (just behind head)\n  - DOWN to (7,-1) \u274c OFF BOARD!\n  - LEFT to (6,0): EMPTY \u2705\n  - RIGHT to (8,0): EMPTY \u2705\nSo 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT). Better than 1! But still limited.\n\nCHAT, BOTH OPTIONS ARE DANGEROUS! \ud83d\ude2c But we MUST pick one! Gotta think about LONG-TERM TRAPPING OPPONENT!\n\nOPPONENT IS STUCK TOP-RIGHT. We want to slowly advance north to cut off their escape south. If we go DOWN to (7,0), we're on south edge \u2014 harder to advance north. If we go UP to (7,2) and eat apple, we grow but then only UP is safe next turn \u2014 that forces us north toward opponent! That could help us box them in! But risky if we get trapped ourselves.\n\nLET'S CHECK IF GOING UP TO (7,2) AND THEN UP TO (7,3) NEXT TURN IS SAFE AFTER THAT:\nFrom (7,3) after eating apple at (7,2), body longer. Then from (7,3):\n- UP to (7,4): OUR BODY? Wait, our body has (7,4)? Yes! Our body has (7,4) from earlier! \u274c\n- DOWN to (7,2): OUR BODY \u274c\n- LEFT to (6,3): OUR BODY \u274c (part of old body)\n- RIGHT to (8,3): OUR BODY \u274c (part of old body)\nFROM (7,3) AFTER THAT SEQUENCE, ALL MOVES BLOCKED! \ud83d\udc80 That means if we go UP to (7,2) now, then next turn we MUST go UP to (7,3), and then we're STUCK and DIE THE TURN AFTER! That's a 2-turn suicide! NO GOOD!\n\nSO UP IS A TRAP! DOWN is safer short-term.\n\nBUT WAIT! What if from (7,0) next turn we go LEFT to (6,0)? Then from (6,0):\n- UP to (6,1): our body? Tail might have moved by then... Let's simulate: If we move DOWN now to (7,0), tail at (6,1) moves forward to (6,2)? Actually, when we don't eat, tail moves forward. Our tail is at (6,1) now. After moving to (7,0), tail moves to (6,2). So (6,1) becomes empty next turn! So from (6,0) next turn, UP to (6,1) would be empty! That gives more options.\n\nWe need to keep mobility! DOWN to (7,0) gives us future flexibility to go left/right along south edge, maybe work way up later.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF \ud83d\udcdd:\nWe're avoiding getting trapped! Opponent still stuck top-right. We need to control center/south and slowly build wall north. Maybe next turn from (7,0) go LEFT to (6,0) to start circling back toward center. Avoid going north into our own body maze. Let opponent maybe crash themselves.\n\nSAFETY FIRST! DOWN keeps us alive with more future options than UP.\n\nLET'S GO DOWN! KEEP THE LEAD AND LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER TURN! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Next turn from (8,0):\n  - UP to (8,1): OUR BODY \u274c (segment at (8,1) still there)\n  - DOWN to (8,-1) \u274c OFF BOARD!\n  - LEFT to (7,0): OUR BODY \u274c (old head)\n  - RIGHT to (9,0): EMPTY \u2705\nSo only RIGHT is safe next turn! That's a DEAD END \u2014 only 1 safe move! SUPER RISKY! If we go RIGHT to (9,0), then next turn only RIGHT is safe, but that's off board! \ud83d\udc80 So RIGHT is a TRAP!\n\nCHAT, RIGHT LEADS TO A QUICK DEATH! LEFT GIVES US OPTIONS! \ud83e\udde0\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF \ud83d\udcdd:\nWe need to start encircling opponent! They're stuck top-left corner (head at (1,9)). We should move LEFT to (6,0), then next turn likely go UP to (6,1) to start advancing north along column 6, which is currently mostly empty above us. That will help us build a wall to trap them! Avoid going too far east (right) into our own body maze. Keep mobility high! Let them maybe eat that apple at (0,9) and extend into a tighter spot. We'll slowly close the net!\n\nSAFETY FIRST! LEFT keeps us alive with more future options!\n\nLET'S GO LEFT! KEEP THE LEAD AND START THE BOX! \ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

OUR HEAD AT **(6,0)** NOW! \ud83d\udea8\n\nIMMEDIATE SAFETY CHECK FROM (6,0):\n\n- **UP** to (6,1): \u274c OUR OWN BODY! That's our tail segment from last turn's body list? Wait check board: At (6,1) it's marked 'T' (our tail) but after moving last turn, tail moved forward! Actually our body list says tail is at (6,1)? Let's verify: body list: head (6,0), then (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1) \u2014 WAIT THAT'S 12 SEGMENTS! But apples collected = 11, length should be 12? Yes, 11 apples means length 12! So (6,1) is occupied by our own body (second to last segment). UP to (6,1) = DEATH! \u274c\n\n- **DOWN** to (6,-1): \u274c OFF BOARD! \u274c\n\n- **LEFT** to (5,0): Check board: column 5 row 0 is '.' empty! \u2705\n\n- **RIGHT** to (7,0): That's our own body (second segment)! \u274c\n\nONLY LEFT IS SAFE?! \ud83d\ude31\n\nCHECK OPPONENT HEAD AT **(0,9)**! Their moves:\n- UP off board \u274c\n- DOWN to (0,8): empty \u2705\n- LEFT off board \u274c\n- RIGHT to (1,9): their own body \u274c\n\nSo they can only go DOWN to (0,8)! They're trapped! No head-on collision possible since we're moving LEFT to (5,0). \u2705\n\nBUT CHAT \u2014 ONLY ONE SAFE MOVE?! That's TERRIFYING! Let's double-check RIGHT: (7,0) is definitely our body segment after last move? Yes, body list shows (7,0) right after head! So RIGHT is suicide! \u274c\n\nLEFT it is! But we need to think ahead \u2014 after moving LEFT to (5,0), what next?\n\nNEXT TURN FROM (5,0):\n- UP to (5,1): board shows '.' empty \u2705\n- DOWN to (5,-1): off board \u274c\n- LEFT to (4,0): board shows 'A'? Wait column 4 row 0 is 'A' \u2014 apple! \ud83c\udf4e But also check if occupied by opponent? No, opponent is far away. That's an apple! \u2705\n- RIGHT to (6,0): That will be our old head position, now occupied by our body after this turn's move! So \u274c\n\nSo from (5,0) next turn, UP and LEFT are safe! LEFT leads to eating apple! That's GOOD! But we gotta be careful \u2014 eating apple means we grow, tail doesn't move, so our body gets longer! Might reduce future space!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Opponent is stuck top-left corner moving down slowly. We should start building a wall on left side maybe column 4 or 5 to block them from escaping south? But we need to keep mobility! After eating apple at (4,0), we'll be longer, but we can then go UP from there to (4,1) which is empty, then keep moving north to maybe trap them! We have a big lead, we can play safe and just survive while they run out of space!\n\nCHAT, ONLY LEFT IS SAFE, SO WE GO LEFT! KEEP THE STREAK ALIVE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

Next turn from (4,0) only UP and LEFT are safe (RIGHT is our body, DOWN off board). LEFT again leads to another apple at (3,0)\u2014double apple feast but we might trap ourselves against the left wall! \ud83d\udea8\n\nUP to (5,1) keeps us at length 12, and our tail moves forward, opening up space! Next turn from (5,1) we'll have THREE safe moves: UP to (5,2), LEFT to (4,1), RIGHT to (6,1). THAT'S FLEXIBILITY! We keep options open to maneuver and box in the opponent later. With a big lead, we don't need to greedily eat apples right now\u2014we can play for position and force the opponent into a dead end!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: After UP, we'll have multiple paths. Consider moving RIGHT then UP to circle around our own body, or head NORTH to claim the center. Opponent is slowly being forced down and east\u2014we can gradually build a wall on the left side by occupying column 4 or 5, cutting off their escape!

LET'S GOOO! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nBUT CHAT\u2014WHERE'S THE OPPONENT? Snake #1 head at **(0,7)**! They can move DOWN to (0,6) (apple there \ud83c\udf4e), LEFT \u274c off board, RIGHT to (1,7) (empty '.'), UP to (0,8) (their own body \u274c). So they'll likely go DOWN for the apple or RIGHT to avoid hitting themselves. We gotta think about HEAD-ON COLLISION possibility! Could they reach any of our candidate cells THIS TURN? Their max travel is 1 cell. From (0,7) they CANNOT reach (5,2), (4,1), or (6,1) in one move. So NO head-on risk! CLEAR! \u2705\n\nNOW WHICH MOVE IS *BEST*? \ud83e\udd14\n\n\ud83c\udf4e **APPLE PROXIMITY**:  \n- UP to (5,2): Closest apple is (2,4) or (2,6) \u2014 kinda far.  \n- LEFT to (4,1): Closest apple is (3,0) or (2,0) \u2014 getting closer to that left wall apple cluster!  \n- RIGHT to (6,1): Closest apple is (7,2) \u2014 one step away next turn! \ud83d\udea8\n\n\ud83d\udd2e **FUTURE OPTIONS** (from each destination):  \n- **UP to (5,2)**: Next turn safe moves? UP (5,3) empty, LEFT (4,2) empty, RIGHT (6,2) empty. DOWN would be back into our body. That's **3 options** \u2014 solid flexibility!  \n- **LEFT to (4,1)**: Next turn? UP (4,2) empty, LEFT (3,1) empty, DOWN (4,0) apple but our body will be there? Wait, our tail is at (6,3) moving forward next turn, so (4,0) will be free? Actually our body segment at (5,0) will shift, (4,0) currently apple, could be safe next turn. That's potentially **3 options** too, but pushes us left toward wall.  \n- **RIGHT to (6,1)**: Next turn? UP (6,2) empty, RIGHT (7,1) our body? Check board: (7,1) is 'T' our body! So RIGHT next turn would be suicide. DOWN (6,0) our body. LEFT back to (5,1) empty but our body leaves? Actually our body leaves (5,1) this turn, so next turn (5,1) could be safe? Hmm risky. So from (6,1) only UP and maybe LEFT are safe next turn \u2014 **2 options** and less flexibility.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We want to BOX IN THE OPPONENT! They're stuck top-left. If we go RIGHT, we head toward our own long body coil \u2014 might trap ourselves. Going LEFT gets us closer to cutting off their southward escape along left wall. Going UP keeps us central and mobile! With a lead, we should maintain SPACE and MANEUVERABILITY, not greedily chase apples right now. Let's stay agile and slowly constrict their area! UP seems strongest for future options! \ud83e\udde0\n\nFINAL DECISION: **UP** keeps us safe, gives us 3 next moves, avoids early trapping, and sets up to dominate the center!\n\nUP",

Their possible moves:\n- UP to (1,5): Empty '.'.\n- DOWN to (1,3): Empty '.'.\n- RIGHT to (2,4): APPLE \ud83c\udf4e (they'll probably go for it!).\n- LEFT to (0,4): Their own body \u274c SUICIDE!\n\nThey CANNOT reach (2,3), (2,1), or (1,2) this turn. NO head-on threat! \u2705\n\nNOW WHICH MOVE IS *BEST*? \ud83e\udd14\n\n\ud83c\udf4e **APPLE PROXIMITY**:\n- UP to (2,3): Gets us closer to the apple cluster at (2,4), (2,6), (2,7) \u2014 but no immediate snack. \ud83d\ude15\n- DOWN to (2,1): IMMEDIATE APPLE \ud83c\udf4e! Boosts our lead to 12-9 (or 12-10 if they eat). \ud83d\ude80\n- LEFT to (1,2): No apple, but advances our strategic positioning! \ud83e\udde0\n\n\ud83d\udd2e **FUTURE OPTIONS** (from each destination):\n- **UP to (2,3)**: Next turn, UP (2,4) might be opponent head if they go right, LEFT (1,3) could be risky, RIGHT (3,3) likely safe. DOWN (2,2) is neck \u274c. So **2-3 options** but some risky.\n- **DOWN to (2,1)**: Next turn, DOWN (2,0) APPLE \ud83c\udf4e, LEFT (1,1) empty, RIGHT (3,1) empty. UP (2,2) is neck \u274c. That's **2 safe moves and 1 apple move** \u2014 GREEDY BUT TEMPTING! \ud83e\udd24\n- **LEFT to (1,2)**: Next turn, UP (1,3) could be opponent if they go down, DOWN (1,1) safe, LEFT (0,2) safe. RIGHT (2,2) is neck \u274c. So **2 safe moves and 1 risky** \u2014 SOLID CONTROL! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN \ud83e\udde0: We're leading! Opponent is TRAPPED along the top-left wall. Our goal is to BOX THEM IN and force a crash! Moving LEFT to (1,2) gets us closer to cutting off their southward escape along the left wall \u2014 STRATEGIC! We can then slowly constrict their space, moving to (0,2) or (1,1) next to build a wall. With the lead, we prioritize TRAPPING OVER GREED! Let's advance our left flank and squeeze them out! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nFINAL DECISION: **LEFT** to (1,2) \u2014 safe, strategic, and keeps the pressure on! LET'S CLAMP DOWN HARDER! \ud83d\udddc\ufe0f\n\nLEFT",

Body goes up to (2,1) then loops around. Apples on board: (9,1), (1,0), (3,0), (5,6), (3,6), (4,0), (7,2), (8,0), (0,1), (5,7), (1,5), (1,7), (6,4), (6,8), (9,7).  \n\n**Possible moves from (2,0):**  \n- UP \u2192 (2,1) \u274c That\u2019s my own body segment (second segment in my list). Dead.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,-1) \u274c Off the board. Dead.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,0) \u2705 That\u2019s an apple! But is it safe?  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,0) \u2705 That\u2019s also an apple!  \n\nSo only LEFT and RIGHT are possible.  \n\n**Now \u2014 danger check:**  \nSnake #1 head at (2,7). Its possible moves from there: UP to (2,8), DOWN to (2,6), LEFT to (1,7), RIGHT to (3,7).  \nNo overlap with my possible moves this turn \u2014 no chance of head-on collision right now. Good.  \n\n**But \u2014 trap thinking:**  \nLEFT to (1,0): That apple is there, so I\u2019d grow. My tail is at (8,1), so my body won\u2019t vacate any spaces yet except the tail end next turn maybe. After moving LEFT, my head at (1,0), body grows, so next turn my options from (1,0): UP to (1,1) \u2014 that\u2019s my body? Let\u2019s check: My body after eating apple: new head at (1,0), old head (2,0) becomes segment 2, (2,1) segment 3, (1,1) segment 4\u2026 wait, is (1,1) in my body currently? Yes! In my current body list: (1,1) is there. So UP from (1,0) would be suicide next turn unless that cell clears. When does it clear? My tail is at (8,1), so in 13 moves? Too long. So moving LEFT might trap me next turn \u2014 only RIGHT from (1,0) maybe? RIGHT to (2,0) \u2014 that\u2019s my old head position, now occupied by my body. So actually from (1,0) after eating apple, only UP and RIGHT are possible? No, UP is body, RIGHT is body, DOWN off board, LEFT off board. That means **LEFT to (1,0) is a death trap next turn** unless my tail moves fast enough to free (1,1) or (2,0) \u2014 but it won\u2019t. So that\u2019s bad.  \n\nRIGHT to (3,0): Apple there too. After eating, head at (3,0), body grows. Next turn from (3,0): check moves: UP to (3,1) \u2014 free? Yes, board shows empty at (3,1). DOWN off board \u274c, LEFT to (2,0) \u2014 that\u2019s my body now, \u274c, RIGHT to (4,0) \u2014 apple there but is it free? Board shows (4,0) empty except apple. So from (3,0) next turn, UP and RIGHT possible. That\u2019s better.  \n\n**Long-term planning:**  \nWe need to survive and outlast. Snake #1 is long and coiled top-left. We should maybe try to box him in later, but right now, keep growing safely.  \n\n**Best move here:** RIGHT to (3,0) \u2014 gets apple, stays alive, keeps options open.  \n\n**Final decision:** RIGHT  \n\nRIGHT",

But snake #1 is breathing down our neck with 13 apples \u2014 CAN'T GET COMPLACENT!\n\n**Current head position:** (3,0)  \n**Possible moves from (3,0):**  \n- UP \u2192 (3,1) \u2705 Board shows empty!  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,-1) \u274c Off the board \u2014 DEATH.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,0) \u274c That's MY body segment (second in my list) \u2014 SUICIDE!  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,0) \u2705 That's an APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e  \n\nSo only UP and RIGHT are *immediately* safe.\n\n**DANGER CHECK \u2014 Snake #1's head at (1,7):**  \nIts possible moves: UP to (1,8), DOWN to (1,6), LEFT to (0,7), RIGHT to (2,7).  \nNone directly threaten my (3,1) or (4,0) *this turn* \u2014 but WAIT! If I go RIGHT to (4,0), that's an apple, so I grow. Snake #1 could move RIGHT to (2,7) \u2014 still far. But what about NEXT TURN?  \n\n**Thinking ahead:**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (4,0):  \n- I eat apple, grow. New head at (4,0). Body now: head (4,0), then (3,0), (2,0), (2,1)... tail at (8,1).  \nNext turn from (4,0): UP to (4,1) \u2014 free? Board shows (4,1) empty. DOWN off board \u274c, LEFT to (3,0) \u2014 my body \u274c, RIGHT to (5,0) \u2014 free? Board shows (5,0) empty. So UP and RIGHT possible \u2014 NICE options!  \n\nIf I go UP to (3,1):  \n- No apple, so no growth. Head at (3,1). Body stays same length, tail at (8,1) moves away from (8,1)? Actually tail moves forward one, so (7,1) becomes new tail? Wait, my body list: tail is (8,1), then (7,1), (7,0)... So moving UP means my tail vacates (8,1).  \nNext turn from (3,1): UP to (3,2) \u2014 that's my body segment? Let's check: in current body, (3,2) is there. But after moving UP, (3,2) becomes segment... Actually, my body shifts: head to (3,1), old head (3,0) becomes segment 2, (2,0) segment 3, (2,1) segment 4, (1,1) segment 5, (1,2) segment 6, (2,2) segment 7, (3,2) segment 8 \u2014 so YES, (3,2) is occupied! So UP from (3,1) next turn is suicide unless tail moves far enough \u2014 but tail is at (8,1), so (3,2) won't clear soon. So UP from (3,1) next turn is likely DEATH. Other moves from (3,1): DOWN to (3,0) \u2014 my old head, now body \u274c, LEFT to (2,1) \u2014 body \u274c, RIGHT to (4,1) \u2014 free. So going UP this turn leaves me ONLY RIGHT next turn \u2014 that's a TRAP!  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nWe need to BOX SNAKE #1! Look at their coil top-left \u2014 they're trapped against the wall! Their head at (1,7), body wrapped around. If we can cut off their escape, they'll crash. But first, SAFELY GROW. Right now, going RIGHT gets us an apple AND keeps future options open. Going UP gets us nothing and traps us next turn.  \n\n**VERDICT:** RIGHT is the ONLY move that gives us growth + future flexibility. UP is a death sentence next turn.  \n\n**FINAL MOVE:** RIGHT  \n\nRIGHT",

Could go there.  \nLEFT to (0,6) \u2014 its own body \u274c  \nRIGHT to (2,6) \u2014 empty? Board shows (2,6) is empty.  \n\nSo enemy could go DOWN to (1,5) or RIGHT to (2,6). Neither threatens our (4,1) or (5,0) directly THIS turn. But we gotta think ONE TURN AHEAD.\n\n**Thinking ahead:**  \nIf I go UP to (4,1):  \n- No apple \u2192 no growth.  \n- Next turn from (4,1): UP to (4,2) \u2014 my body \u274c (segment in current list: (4,2) is occupied). DOWN to (4,0) \u2014 my old head, now body \u274c. LEFT to (3,1) \u2014 free? Board shows empty. RIGHT to (5,1) \u2014 free? Board shows empty. So next turn only LEFT or RIGHT \u2014 not terrible, but cuts options.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (5,0):  \n- No apple \u2192 no growth.  \n- Next turn from (5,0): UP to (5,1) \u2014 free? Board shows empty. DOWN off board \u274c. LEFT to (4,0) \u2014 my body \u274c. RIGHT to (6,0) \u2014 free? Board shows (6,0) empty? Wait, check board: column 6 row 0 is empty? Yes, (6,0) is empty. So next turn UP or RIGHT possible.  \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**  \nWe wanna trap snake #1! They\u2019re wrapped against top wall. If we can cut off their south escape, they\u2019ll crash. Right now, moving UP gets us closer to apples (5,6), (3,6) and maybe lets us swing left to block them. Moving RIGHT keeps us near bottom row \u2014 safe but maybe less aggressive.  \n\nBut WAIT \u2014 going UP to (4,1) next turn only has LEFT/RIGHT. Going RIGHT to (5,0) next turn has UP/RIGHT. Both keep options.  \n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:**  \nSnake #1 will likely go DOWN to (1,5) to eat apple and grow \u2014 that puts their head closer to us! If they eat (1,5), they grow longer, tail stays up top. Then they might try to slither south.  \n\nIf we go UP, we\u2019re moving toward them \u2014 could risk head-on collision next turn if they move toward us. If we go RIGHT, we stay safe bottom row, maybe lure them down while we collect apples on right side later.  \n\n**SAFETY FIRST \u2014 but also AGGRESSIVE TRAP:**  \nI think UP is riskier but more aggressive for boxing. RIGHT is safer but maybe passive. We\u2019re up by 2 apples \u2014 let\u2019s play SMART but keep pressure!  \n\n**VERDICT:** Going UP sets up future control of center, keeps us moving toward apples. Going RIGHT keeps escape routes. Let\u2019s choose UP \u2014 we can always dodge next turn if enemy gets close!  \n\n**FINAL MOVE:** UP  \n\nUP",

GOTTA HOLD THIS LEAD AND PUT THE PRESSURE ON SNAKE #1!\n\n**MY HEAD:** (4,1)  \n**MY BODY:** Long boi from (4,0) to (7,1)  \n**SNAKE #1 HEAD:** (1,5) \u2014 WAIT, THEY MOVED! They must've gone DOWN last turn to eat that apple at (1,5)! That's why they're at 14 apples now! Their body got longer, tail still up top.\n\n**APPLE CHECK:** Closest apples to us? (5,6), (3,6), (2,3), (0,1), (9,1), (5,5), (6,4)... but SAFETY FIRST!\n\n**POSSIBLE MOVES FROM (4,1):**\n- **UP \u2192 (4,2)** \u274c That's MY BODY! Segment (4,2) is in my current body list \u2014 SUICIDE!\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,0)** \u274c That's also MY BODY! (4,0) is my second segment \u2014 DEATH!\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,1)** \u2705 Board shows empty! Looks safe.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,1)** \u2705 Board shows empty! Also safe.\n\nSo ONLY LEFT and RIGHT are safe immediately! NO UP/DOWN!\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION \u2014 Snake #1 from (1,5):**\nTheir possible moves:\n- UP to (1,6) \u2014 Their own body? Their body list shows (1,6) is their second segment \u2014 \u274c COLLISION!\n- DOWN to (1,4) \u2014 Their own body? Their body list shows (1,4) is occupied \u2014 \u274c COLLISION!\n- LEFT to (0,5) \u2014 Their own body? Their body shows (0,5) occupied \u2014 \u274c COLLISION!\n- RIGHT to (2,5) \u2014 Board shows empty! \u2705\n\nWAIT \u2014 ARE YOU SEEING THIS CHAT?! Snake #1 ONLY HAS ONE SAFE MOVE: RIGHT to (2,5)! They're TRAPPED by their own body! Unless I'm misreading their body coordinates... Let's check: Their body: [(1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,9)]  \nYEP! (1,6) up, (1,4) down, (0,5) left \u2014 all blocked. Only RIGHT to (2,5) is free! THEY'RE FORCED RIGHT!\n\n**SO IF THEY GO RIGHT TO (2,5):** That's an empty cell. No apple there. They won't grow. Their head will be at (2,5) next turn.\n\n**MY MOVE OPTIONS ANALYSIS:**\n\n1. **LEFT to (3,1):**\n   - Next turn from (3,1): Possible moves? UP to (3,2) \u2014 my body \u274c, DOWN to (3,0) \u2014 my body \u274c, LEFT to (2,1) \u2014 my body? Wait, (2,1) is my body? My body list: ... (2,1) is occupied! \u274c, RIGHT to (4,1) \u2014 my old head/body \u274c. OMG! LEFT to (3,1) would leave me with ZERO safe moves next turn! I'd be STUCK and DIE! That's a DEAD END! \u274c\u274c\u274c\n\n2. **RIGHT to (5,1):**\n   - Next turn from (5,1): Possible moves? UP to (5,2) \u2014 my body? My body list shows (5,2) occupied \u274c, DOWN to (5,0) \u2014 my body? (5,0) occupied \u274c, LEFT to (4,1) \u2014 my old head/body \u274c, RIGHT to (6,1) \u2014 Board shows empty? Checking board: (6,1) is empty! \u2705 So ONLY RIGHT is safe next turn! That's risky but at least one move.\n\n   But wait, if I go RIGHT to (5,1), enemy goes RIGHT to (2,5). Next turn my head at (5,1), enemy head at (2,5). Distance 3 apart. I'd only have RIGHT to (6,1). Then enemy could maybe move toward me... Hmm.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:** Snake #1 is forced right this turn! They might be trying to loop around. We need to NOT get trapped ourselves! Going LEFT is INSTANT DEATH next turn \u2014 NEVER do that! Going RIGHT gives us at least one follow-up. But maybe there's a better play...\n\nHOLD UP \u2014 What about APPLE at (5,5)? If I go RIGHT to (5,1), I'm moving toward column 6 row 1, not directly toward apple. But maybe I can maneuver later.\n\n**WHAT ABOUT COLLISION RISK?** If I go RIGHT to (5,1) and enemy goes RIGHT to (2,5), no collision this turn. Next turn if I go RIGHT to (6,1), enemy from (2,5) could go DOWN to (2,4) (their body? (2,4) is their body \u2014 blocked), LEFT to (1,5) (empty?), UP to (2,6) (empty?), RIGHT to (3,5) (empty?). They'll have options. Could they cut me off?\n\n**SAFETY CHECK:** Going RIGHT to (5,1) is safe NOW. Going LEFT to (3,1) is safe NOW but suicide next turn. So LEFT is ELIMINATED! So only RIGHT is viable!\n\nWAIT \u2014 IS THERE ANY OTHER MOVE? NO! UP and DOWN are instant death. LEFT is death next turn. ONLY RIGHT!\n\n**VERDICT:** We have to go RIGHT! It's our only move that keeps us alive more than one turn! We'll live to fight another turn and maybe snake #1 will make a mistake!\n\n**FUTURE SELF NOTE:** We're at (5,1) next turn, only safe move is RIGHT to (6,1). Enemy at (2,5). We need to plan an escape route \u2014 maybe go UP to (6,2) if free, or continue right. Collect apples on right side (6,4), (6,8), (9,7). Avoid boxing ourselves in!\n\nRIGHT",
