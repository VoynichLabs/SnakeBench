There are also apples at (0,3) and (0,5).\n- The enemy snake is at (2,1), quite far from us.\n- Our current position is relatively free to move around, but falling off the top or right edges would be fatal, and moving into our own body or the enemy's location must be avoided.\n- No other snakes are near our head that threaten an immediate head-on collision this turn, since the enemy's head is at (2,1).\n\nPossible moves:\n- UP: Would move us from (9,6) to (9,7). This stays on the right edge and away from the enemy snake. It keeps us moving vertically upward, possibly toward the apple at (9,0), but that requires moving down multiple steps.\n- DOWN: Would move us to (9,5). Moving down might better position us closer to the apple at (9,0), but we need multiple moves to get there.\n- LEFT: Moves us to (8,6). Moving left would position us toward the center and left side, which might help access apples at (0,0) or (0,3), but it's a longer route.\n- RIGHT: Would move us off the board to (10,6), which would be fatal, so not allowed.\n\nEliminating impossible move:\n- RIGHT (out of bounds).\n\nRemaining options:\n- UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nWe need to prioritize safety and positioning:\n\n- UP keeps us moving toward the top, away from the enemy snake and edges; it doesn't bring us closer to any immediate apple.\n- DOWN could help us descend toward bottom apples, such as at (0,0), but that would take multiple moves.\n- LEFT moves us toward the left side \u2013 potentially toward apples at (0,0), (0,3), and (0,5). Moving left would be strategic to reach those apples.\n\nConsidering the risk:\n- Moving LEFT from (9,6) to (8,6) appears safe; there's no immediate obstacle, and it positions us to potentially move left in subsequent turns toward the apples on the left.\n\nPotential worries:\n- Moving left doesn't risk hitting the body or enemy this turn.\n- Moving down or up could be less optimal because they don't immediately bring us closer to apples, and moving up may be more risky if we get cornered.\n\nExecution:\n- Moving LEFT seems most strategic at this moment to optimize apple access while maintaining safety.\n\nPlan:\n- Proceed to move LEFT, avoiding dead ends or collisions, aiming to navigate toward the left-side apples in subsequent turns.\n\nFinal move:\n\nLEFT",

No nearby obstacles, and it positions us toward the upper side, where some apples are located at (9, 0) and (7, 9). But moving up might be less immediate for those apples unless planning a longer route.\n- Moving DOWN: (8, 7): safe, no nearby enemies or apples, offers persistent space.\n- Moving LEFT: (7, 8): already taken as previous move, but moving left again is possible with the tail extending further left, keeps us heading toward left-side apples.\n- Moving RIGHT: (9, 8): boundary edge, limited future options and potential collision if not careful.\n\nAvoiding boundary boundary, and considering the position of apples:\n- The apple at (7, 9) is directly above the current position if moving UP,\n- Apple at (9, 0) is far away down the right,\n- Apple at (1, 5): to the far left and bottom,\n- Apple at (3, 8): on the upper left.\n\nOur current position is at (8,8).

We are just beneath it, so moving UP will put us into (8,9), just below the apple, allowing an easy next move to (7,9) if desired.\n\nI see no immediate threats, and moving UP aligns with approaching the apple at (7,9).
