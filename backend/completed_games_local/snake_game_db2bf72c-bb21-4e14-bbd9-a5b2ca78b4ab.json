Moving there can kill them if they go UP (they'd move into my neck), but they can instead go RIGHT or DOWN and avoid the trap \u2014 risky.\n- UP -> (6,9): legal but on the top edge, which reduces follow-up options.\n- RIGHT -> (7,8): legal, moves toward the nearby apple at (8,8), keeps more open space and forces the enemy to avoid moving UP (which would kill them by moving into my neck).\n\nReasoning:\n- RIGHT advances toward an immediate apple and keeps multiple escape options (up, right, or back later \u2014 though not left this turn).\n- DOWN is an aggressive bait but unreliable (opponent can avoid the trap). UP is safer than DOWN but worse than RIGHT for apple access and space.\n- RIGHT also preserves the possible trap on the enemy if they try to move into my neck, but does not gamble my survival on them choosing a single move.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Push to (8,8) to grab the apple, then reassess: prefer open space and avoid being funneled by the enemy's body. If the enemy gets trapped against my body, exploit it; otherwise, head toward the top-left apples once (8,8) is secured.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe this turn (no enemy head nearby), and taking it gives me the lead (8 vs 7 apples).\n\nRisk assessment:\n- No enemy can reach (3,6) this turn, and moving DOWN does not collide with any body segment. Eating the apple is the highest-value safe move now.\n- After eating, I will grow, so I must avoid immediately moving into tight space; I can safely exit east or west from (3,6) afterward.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Move DOWN now to eat the apple at (3,6).\n- After eating, move EAST toward the cluster of apples further right (aim for (6,8)), while avoiding the left-wall corridor and maintaining multiple escape routes.\n\nDOWN",

This cell is empty and not occupied by any other snake\u2019s segment, so it is safe.  \n   - **LEFT** would move us to (8,2). This cell is also empty and not part of any other snake\u2019s body, so it is safe.\n\n2. **Goal alignment** \u2013 Our target apple at (5,3) is to the left and slightly up. Moving **LEFT** reduces the horizontal distance to that apple from 4 steps to 3 steps, while keeping our vertical coordinate unchanged. This brings us closer to an edible apple without exposing us to immediate risk.\n\n3. **Future flexibility** \u2013 After moving LEFT we will be at (8,2) with the body segment (9,2) now directly behind us. From (8,2) we retain the options to move UP, DOWN (unsafe now), or LEFT again, preserving multiple safe follow\u2011up directions. Moving UP would also be safe but would not reduce the horizontal gap to the nearest apple, leaving us farther from a food source.\n\n4. **Collision avoidance with opponent** \u2013 The only visible opponent (snake\u202f#0) currently occupies columns 4\u20117 and rows 4\u20118. Neither (9,3) nor (8,2) lies on any of those cells, and nothing in the current state suggests an imminent head\u2011on collision with that snake\u2019s head.\n\n**Conclusion** \u2013 The safe move that also advances us toward the nearest apple while keeping multiple future options open is to move **LEFT**.\n\nLEFT",

RIGHT moves me directly toward those apples and preserves multiple follow-up options (continue right to eat apples, then drop down to (9,7) or circle back).\n- UP would push me to the top edge and reduce vertical flexibility; DOWN moves away from the nearest apples and could funnel me toward areas with more of my own body nearby.\n- RIGHT keeps the most direct path to high-value apples while keeping escape options open.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Continue right to (8,8) then (9,8) to take that apple; if (9,7) remains, drop down to take it.\n- After collecting, assess enemy positions and remaining apples (notably (8,0), (7,1), (2,3)) and avoid getting boxed in by my long tail on the left side.\n\nRIGHT",
