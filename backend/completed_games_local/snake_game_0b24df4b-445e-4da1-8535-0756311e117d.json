Possible moves from (2, 7):**  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 8) \u2014 inside board, no body, no enemy body there currently.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 6) \u2014 safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 7) \u2014 safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 7) \u2014 safe.  \n\nNo immediate death from board edges or bodies since all snakes length 1.  \n\n---\n\n**2. Check for possible head-on collisions:**  \nEnemy head at (5, 3). They could move UP to (5, 4), DOWN to (5, 2), LEFT to (4, 3), RIGHT to (6, 3).  \nNo overlap possible with my possible next head positions except if we both move into same cell \u2014 not possible here since they\u2019re far away.  \n\nSo all four moves are safe from immediate death.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Which move helps toward apples while keeping options open?**  \nClosest apple to (2, 7): (0, 7) is 2 steps left, (9, 7) is 7 steps right, (8, 9) far, (9, 3) far, (1, 1) far.  \n\n(0, 7) is close but:  \n- Moving LEFT to (1, 7) gets closer to (0, 7) (1 step away next turn).  \n- But moving LEFT also reduces future options next turn? Let\u2019s check: from (1, 7), possible moves next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. LEFT to (0, 7) gets apple but then wall left, so fewer options after eating apple (grows to length 2). Still okay.  \n\nOther apples: (1, 1) is far, so not priority yet.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Future options:**  \nFrom (2, 7):  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 8): then apples nearby: (8, 9) still far, (9, 7) far.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 6): moves away from (0, 7).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 7): toward apple (0, 7), also keeps access to bottom-left area.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 7): toward center, but no apple there.  \n\nLEFT seems best for short-term apple grab, and board is mostly empty now so no trap risk yet.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nIf I go LEFT to (1, 7), next turn I can go LEFT to (0, 7) to eat apple, but must avoid moving into wall or into enemy possible positions. After eating, I\u2019ll have length 2, so need to plan path to avoid trapping myself later. Maybe after (0, 7), go DOWN toward (1, 1) apple area if safe.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

So no direct head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Future safety check for each move:**  \n\n1. **UP to (1, 9):**  \nNext turn from (1, 9): moves: DOWN (1, 8) \u2192 body (tail at (0, 8)), but tail will move if no apple eaten? Wait: I\u2019m length 2 now, tail at (0, 8). If I move UP to (1, 9) and don\u2019t eat apple, my tail moves from (0, 8) to ??? Actually snake movement: head goes to new cell, each body segment shifts forward, last segment (tail) vacates its cell.  \nSo after moving to (1, 9) without apple: body becomes [(1, 9), (1, 8)], tail (0, 8) disappears. So next turn from (1, 9): DOWN to (1, 8) is now body segment (1, 8) \u2192 still invalid (would hit myself). LEFT (0, 9) empty, RIGHT (2, 9) empty, UP off board. So safe moves next turn: LEFT, RIGHT (2 options).  \n\n2. **DOWN to (1, 7):**  \nAfter moving DOWN without apple: body [(1, 7), (1, 8)], tail gone from (0, 8).  \nFrom (1, 7): UP (1, 8) body \u2192 invalid, DOWN (1, 6) empty, LEFT (0, 7) empty, RIGHT (2, 7) empty. So safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n3. **RIGHT to (2, 8):**  \nAfter moving RIGHT without apple: body [(2, 8), (1, 8)], tail gone from (0, 8).  \nFrom (2, 8): UP (2, 9) empty, DOWN (2, 7) empty, LEFT (1, 8) body \u2192 invalid, RIGHT (3, 8) empty. Safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple to (1, 8): (4, 7) is 3 right, 1 down \u2192 distance 4.  \n(8, 9) far, (9, 7) far, (1, 1) far, (8, 6) far.  \nFrom (1, 8):  \n- UP (1, 9) \u2192 farther from (4, 7).  \n- DOWN (1, 7) \u2192 closer to (4, 7) in y, same x distance.  \n- RIGHT (2, 8) \u2192 closer in x to (4, 7).  \n\n**Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy at (9, 3) likely to go LEFT to (8, 3)?? That\u2019s its own body, so invalid. Their valid moves: UP (9, 4), DOWN (9, 2), LEFT (8, 3) body \u2192 invalid, RIGHT off board. So they can only go UP or DOWN. Apple at (9, 7) is far for them now, apple at (8, 6) closer but not reachable immediately. They might go UP toward (9, 4), then later toward apples. They\u2019re not an immediate threat to my area.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI want to go toward (4, 7) while keeping options open. DOWN gives 3 safe moves next turn and moves toward that apple. RIGHT also gives 3 safe moves and moves toward apple horizontally. UP gives only 2 safe moves and moves away from apple.  \n\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT:  \nDOWN to (1, 7) is slightly better because next turn I can go RIGHT to (2, 7) and then up to (2, 8) etc., staying flexible. RIGHT to (2, 8) leaves me with body behind at (1, 8), which could limit LEFT next turn.  \n\nLet\u2019s check: from (1, 7), next turn I can go RIGHT to (2, 7) then up toward (4, 7). From (2, 8), next turn I can go DOWN to (2, 7) then right toward (4, 7). Both fine. But DOWN also opens path toward bottom apples like (1, 1) later.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose DOWN for more central positioning and flexibility.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (1, 7), aim for apple (4, 7) via RIGHT then UP, while monitoring enemy movement. Avoid trapping along edges.  \n\nDOWN",

Current positions**  \nMy snake (ID 1): head at (4,3), body: [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6)] \u2014 so my body goes upward from my head.  \nEnemy snake #0: head at (7,9), body: [(8,9), (8,8), (9,8)].  \nApples: (1,1), (8,6), (4,2), (2,7), (7,6).\n\n**2. Possible moves from (4,3)**  \n- UP \u2192 (4,4): occupied by my own body segment \u2192 immediate death.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,2): currently an apple, empty otherwise.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,3): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,3): empty.\n\n**3. Eliminate lethal moves**  \nUP is lethal (own body).  \nDOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are not obviously lethal:  \n- DOWN (4,2): not off board, not my body, not enemy body currently.  \n- LEFT (3,3): same.  \n- RIGHT (5,3): same.\n\nCheck enemy\u2019s possible moves from (7,9):  \nEnemy could move DOWN to (7,8), LEFT to (6,9), or RIGHT to (8,9) (occupied by its own body), so RIGHT is lethal for them, so likely they won\u2019t choose RIGHT. They could choose DOWN or LEFT.  \nTheir possible moves don\u2019t immediately threaten my candidate squares (4,2), (3,3), (5,3) because they are far away.\n\n**4. Head-on collision risk**  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (7,8), LEFT to (6,9), no conflict with my moves.  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (8,9) (its own body), they die \u2014 but I can\u2019t predict they\u2019ll choose that.  \nNo risk of head-on collision this turn because they are far.\n\n**5. Future options after each move**  \n- DOWN to (4,2): eating apple \u2192 grow by 1, body becomes [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6)] \u2014 tail at (4,6). Next turn head at (4,2). From there, possible moves: UP to (4,3) \u2014 occupied by my new body? Wait: after growth, body segments shift: head new at (4,2), next segment (4,3), then (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). So UP to (4,3) is my own body, so UP not safe next turn. From (4,2), DOWN to (4,1) safe, LEFT to (3,2) safe, RIGHT to (5,2) safe. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n- LEFT to (3,3): not eating apple. Body shifts: head (3,3), then old head (4,3) becomes new segment 2, then (4,4), (4,5), tail (4,6). From (3,3), possible moves: UP (3,4) empty, DOWN (3,2) empty, LEFT (2,3) empty, RIGHT (4,3) my body (segment 2). So 3 safe moves next turn too.  \n\n- RIGHT to (5,3): similar to LEFT, 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n**6. Apple proximity**  \nClosest apples to (4,3):  \n- (4,2) distance 1 (DOWN)  \n- (1,1) distance |3|+|2|=5  \n- (2,7) far  \n- (7,6) far  \n- (8,6) far  \n\nSo DOWN gets an apple immediately, increasing my apples to 4 vs enemy\u2019s 3 (they have 3 apples now). That gives me a lead.\n\n**7. Risk of eating apple**  \nEating apple means growing longer, which could limit future mobility slightly, but here my snake length is only 4 now, growing to 5 \u2014 still manageable on 10x10.  \nAlso, eating apple means enemy might try to contest remaining apples, but currently they are far away.\n\n**8. Long-term planning**  \nAfter eating apple at (4,2), I\u2019ll have head at (4,2), body blocking UP. I\u2019ll be near bottom edge (y=2). Apples left: (1,1), (8,6), (2,7), (7,6). Could aim for (1,1) next via LEFT then DOWN. Need to avoid boxing myself near bottom-left corner.\n\nGiven all: DOWN gets apple, safe now, gives lead, and future moves still available.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving DOWN to (4,2) and eating apple, next turn avoid UP (own body). Consider moving LEFT toward (1,1) or RIGHT toward center to keep space. Monitor enemy movement from (7,9) \u2014 they may go for (8,6) or (7,6).\n\n**Final move:**  \nDOWN",

None of those threaten (1, 2) or (1, 1) immediately.\n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nFrom (1, 2):  \n- (1, 1) distance 1 (DOWN)  \n- (5, 1) distance 4  \n- (5, 3) distance 4  \n- (2, 7) distance 5  \n- (8, 1) distance 8  \n\nClosest apple is (1, 1), reachable directly DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**\n\n1. **DOWN to (1, 1) \u2192 eat apple, grow to length 6**  \n   New body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3)] (tail stays at (4, 3) because we grow).  \n   From (1, 1) next turn:  \n   UP (1, 2) my body \u2014 lethal.  \n   DOWN (1, 0) empty \u2014 safe.  \n   LEFT (0, 1) empty \u2014 safe.  \n   RIGHT (2, 1) empty \u2014 safe.  \n   \u2192 3 safe moves next turn, but UP is blocked by my own new body.\n\n2. **UP to (1, 3)**  \n   New body: [(1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2)] (tail (4, 3) disappears).  \n   From (1, 3):  \n   UP (1, 4) empty \u2014 safe.  \n   DOWN (1, 2) my body \u2014 lethal.  \n   LEFT (0, 3) empty \u2014 safe.  \n   RIGHT (2, 3) empty \u2014 safe.  \n   \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n3. **LEFT to (0, 2)**  \n   New body: [(0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2)] (tail (4, 3) disappears).  \n   From (0, 2):  \n   UP (0, 3) empty \u2014 safe.  \n   DOWN (0, 1) empty \u2014 safe.  \n   LEFT out of bounds \u2014 lethal.  \n   RIGHT (1, 2) my body \u2014 lethal.  \n   \u2192 only 2 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN). Worse mobility.\n\n---\n\n**Comparison:**  \n- DOWN: gets apple, length increases, 3 safe moves next turn.  \n- UP: no apple, 3 safe moves next turn.  \n- LEFT: no apple, only 2 safe moves next turn (riskier).\n\nSo LEFT is weakest. Between DOWN and UP, DOWN gets apple and equal next\u2011turn mobility. No immediate enemy threat to (1, 1).\n\n---\n\n**Long\u2011term plan for next turn:**  \nIf I take apple at (1, 1), next turn I\u2019ll be at (1, 1) with body behind me. Safe moves: DOWN to (1, 0), LEFT to (0, 1), RIGHT to (2, 1).  \nFrom there, nearest apples are (5, 1) or (5, 3). I should head toward (5, 1) via (2, 1) \u2192 (3, 1) \u2192 (4, 1) \u2192 (5, 1), but watch enemy movement toward (8, 1) apple \u2014 enemy might head that way too.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN gets apple safely, improves score, keeps good mobility.\n\nDOWN",

No enemy body there, not my body, not off-board.  \n   - Could enemy head move there? No, enemy is at (8,8), too far.  \n   - Safe from head-on collision.  \n\n2. **UP to (4,2)** \u2013 safe, no immediate threats.  \n\n3. **DOWN to (4,0)** \u2013 safe, no immediate threats.  \n\n**Considerations:**  \n- Eating apple at (5,1) grows me by 1 segment next turn (tail doesn\u2019t move this turn).  \n- Apple at (5,1) is closest, low-risk.  \n- Enemy is far away, no collision risk this turn.  \n- After eating apple at (5,1), my head will be at (5,1), body adds segment at old head (4,1), so next turn my neck will be at (4,1) and (3,1), so moving LEFT next turn from (5,1) would be into (4,1) which is my body\u2014so I should plan to avoid trapping myself.  \n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (5,1) and eating apple, my length increases to 7 segments. My tail at (2,2) will move next turn to (1,1) if I move right again? Wait, tail movement:  \nCurrent body: head (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) tail.  \nAfter moving RIGHT to (5,1) and eating apple: new head (5,1), old head (4,1) becomes new neck, tail stays at (2,2) this turn (no movement because ate apple). So next turn, tail will move from (2,2) to where? Actually, when you eat apple, tail does not move that turn, but next turn tail will move forward as usual. So next turn if I move somewhere, tail (2,2) will move to (3,2)? No, tail moves along body path: (2,2) is connected to (1,2) and (1,1) etc. Actually, body order after eating:  \nNew body: (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) tail.  \nSo next turn if I move UP to (5,2), new head (5,2), body becomes (5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2) and tail (2,2) gone. So (2,2) cell frees up.  \n\nBut more important: from (5,1) next turn, possible moves:  \nUP (5,2) \u2013 free? Yes.  \nDOWN (5,0) \u2013 free.  \nLEFT (4,1) \u2013 my body (neck), illegal.  \nRIGHT (6,1) \u2013 free.  \n\nSo I\u2019ll have UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe next turn. That\u2019s fine.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nRIGHT gets an apple safely, no enemy threat, keeps options open next turn.  \n\n**Next-turn plan for future self:**  \nFrom (5,1) after eating apple, avoid LEFT into (4,1). Prefer UP toward apple (5,3) or RIGHT toward (6,4) later. Watch enemy movement\u2014they are far but may come toward center apples eventually.  \n\nRIGHT",

No enemy body in any of these cells currently.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Check head-on collision risk**  \n\nEnemy #0 head: (6, 9), body: [(6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7), (9, 7)]  \n\nPossible enemy moves from (6, 9):  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 10) \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid (dies), so enemy won\u2019t choose UP.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 8) \u2192 own body at (6, 8) \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo enemy can only move LEFT to (5, 9) or RIGHT to (7, 9).  \n\nMy possible head positions after my move:  \n- If I move UP to (5, 4), enemy heads possible: (5, 9) or (7, 9) \u2192 no overlap.  \n- If I move LEFT to (4, 3), enemy heads possible: (5, 9) or (7, 9) \u2192 no overlap.  \n- If I move RIGHT to (6, 3), enemy heads possible: (5, 9) or (7, 9) \u2192 no overlap.  \n\nNo head-on collision risk this turn regardless of my move.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and future safety**  \n\nApples:  \n- (6, 4) is 1 step from (5, 4) if I go UP now.  \n- (4, 2) is 1 step from (4, 3) if I go LEFT now, but (4, 2) is adjacent to my body segment (4, 1)? Wait, (4, 2) is apple, but my body has (4, 1) directly below it. That\u2019s fine; eating apple at (4, 2) next turn if I go LEFT now is possible.  \n- (2, 4), (2, 7), (8, 1) are farther.  \n\nFrom (5, 4) after UP:  \nNext turn safe moves?  \nUP \u2192 (5, 5): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (4, 4): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (6, 4): apple there (6, 4). DOWN \u2192 (5, 3): would be empty next turn (body moves forward). So 3 safe moves, one leads directly to apple.  \n\nFrom (4, 3) after LEFT:  \nNext turn safe moves?  \nUP \u2192 (4, 4): empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (3, 3): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (5, 3): empty next turn.  \nDOWN \u2192 (4, 2): apple there. So 4 safe moves, one leads directly to apple.  \n\nFrom (6, 3) after RIGHT:  \nNext turn safe moves?  \nUP \u2192 (6, 4): apple there.  \nLEFT \u2192 (5, 3): empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7, 3): empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (6, 2): empty. So 4 safe moves, one leads directly to apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Which apple is safest to target?**  \n\nApple at (6, 4): enemy is at (6, 9) far away, but enemy could move toward (6, 8) next? No, enemy can only go LEFT/RIGHT this turn, so they stay at y=9. Next turn enemy could move toward (6, 8) if body clears? Actually enemy body at (6, 8) now, so next turn after moving LEFT/RIGHT, (6, 8) might become tail end? Let\u2019s track:  \nEnemy moves LEFT to (5, 9): body becomes [(6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7)] \u2014 (6, 8) still there. Enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 9): body becomes [(6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8), (8, 7)] \u2014 same. So (6, 8) remains for 1 more turn. Then enemy could move DOWN to (6, 8) next turn? That\u2019s into own body, so no. So enemy can\u2019t reach (6, 4) quickly.  \n\nApple at (4, 2): safe, no enemy competition.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future flexibility**  \n\nLEFT to (4, 3) gives 4 safe moves next turn and apple (4, 2) reachable next.  \nRIGHT to (6, 3) gives 4 safe moves next turn and apple (6, 4) reachable next.  \nUP to (5, 4) gives 3 safe moves next turn and apple (6, 4) reachable next.  \n\nSo UP is slightly less flexible next turn than LEFT or RIGHT.  \n\nBut: Going LEFT means moving away from other apples (2, 7), (8, 1), (2, 4). Going RIGHT keeps me central.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid trapping myself long-term**  \n\nMy body trail goes down to (1,2) and (1,1), etc., so left side is bit congested. Moving RIGHT opens more space.  \n\nGiven enemy far away and no head-on risk, I\u2019ll choose RIGHT to (6, 3) to target apple (6, 4) next turn while keeping maximum safe moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 3), check if (6, 4) is still safe (no enemy moved there). Likely safe. If UP to (6, 4) is safe, take it for apple. If not, choose among other safe moves to avoid dead ends. Monitor enemy #0\u2019s new head position after their move this turn.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

I will move to (8, 9).\nNext turn consider whether RIGHT -> (9, 9) is possible which is out of bounds, and if so, then go DOWN or LEFT. See whether snake #1 is chasing the apple at (6, 4) or not. If it does, then try to avoid.\n\nRIGHT",

Immediate death checks:\n- **UP** (6,5): empty on board (see grid: row 5 col 6 is \u2018.\u2019), not off board, not my body, not enemy body?  \nEnemy snake #0 body: [(8,9),(7,9),(6,9),(6,8),(7,8),(8,8)] \u2192 (6,5) not in that list. Safe.\n- **DOWN** (6,3): my body segment \u2192 unsafe.\n- **LEFT** (5,4): empty on board (grid row 4 col 5 is \u2018.\u2019), not my body, not enemy body \u2192 safe.\n- **RIGHT** (7,4): empty on board (grid row 4 col 7 is \u2018.\u2019), safe.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Enemy head movement prediction:\nEnemy head at (8,9), body: [(7,9),(6,9),(6,8),(7,8),(8,8)]  \nPossible enemy moves:  \nFrom (8,9): UP off board (y=10) \u2192 unsafe. DOWN (8,8) \u2192 occupied by its own body segment (tail end maybe? (8,8) is in body list: yes, it's the last segment? Wait, body list: [(7,9),(6,9),(6,8),(7,8),(8,8)] \u2192 (8,8) is the last body segment, so moving DOWN from (8,9) to (8,8) is into its own body \u2192 unsafe for enemy). LEFT (7,9) \u2192 occupied by its body (first segment) \u2192 unsafe. RIGHT off board (x=9+1) \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nActually, check carefully: enemy body: head (8,9), then (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8). So (8,8) is tail. From (8,9), DOWN to (8,8) is into its own body (last segment) \u2192 illegal move for enemy. So enemy has no safe moves? That means enemy will die this turn if it moves. But game rules: if no safe move, snake still picks one and dies. So enemy likely dies this turn unless I collide with it.\n\nBut my moves: (6,5), (5,4), (7,4) are all far from enemy head (8,9), so no head-on collision possible this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Apple proximity and future options:\nApples:  \n- (2,7): far.  \n- (8,1): far.  \n- (2,4): at (2,4), my head at (6,4) \u2192 same y, 4 left.  \n- (4,2): at (4,2), my head at (6,4) \u2192 2 left, 2 down.  \n- (0,9): far.\n\nClosest apple: (4,2) or (2,4).  \nFrom (6,4):  \n- UP (6,5): away from both closest apples.  \n- LEFT (5,4): closer to (2,4) (x decreased by 1) but also closer to (4,2)? Actually (4,2) is down-left from (5,4).  \n- RIGHT (7,4): away from apples.\n\nLEFT seems best for approaching (2,4) and (4,2).\n\n---\n\n### 5. Future mobility after each move:\nCheck board:  \nAfter UP (6,5): possible next moves from there: U (6,6), L (5,5), R (7,5) likely all free.  \nAfter LEFT (5,4): possible next moves: U (5,5), L (4,4), D (5,3) \u2192 (5,3) is my body currently at second segment, but next turn my tail moves? Let\u2019s see: my body length 9 (head + 8 body segments). If I don\u2019t eat apple, my tail (1,1) will move forward, so (5,3) could become free next turn if my snake moves forward. Actually, when no apple eaten, tail moves, so (5,3) might be free next turn if I move away. But (5,3) currently occupied, so next turn from (5,4), D to (5,3) is safe only if tail moves away by then. Yes, tail moves forward along body path, so (5,3) will be empty next turn. So all three from (5,4) likely safe next turn.\n\nAfter RIGHT (7,4): next moves: U (7,5), R (8,4), D (7,3) all likely free.\n\nAll three safe moves have good mobility.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Avoiding dead ends long-term:\nMy body occupies many lower left cells. Moving LEFT gets me closer to my body\u2019s area, which could limit space later. But apples are there, so I must go there eventually. It\u2019s safe now.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Choose:\nUP: away from apples, but safe.  \nLEFT: toward apples, safe, good mobility.  \nRIGHT: safe but away from apples.\n\nBest: LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn**:  \nWe moved left toward apple (2,4) and (4,2). Next turn, check if enemy is dead (likely). If enemy dead, we win. If not, continue toward nearest apple while keeping options open. Avoid trapping myself in lower left corner; consider moving up toward (2,7) after eating (2,4).\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

So enemy\u2019s only safe move is DOWN to (9,8). That\u2019s far from me, so no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apples and proximity**  \nApples: (2,7), (8,1), (2,4), (4,2), (0,9).  \nFrom (5,4):  \n- UP (5,5): moves away from (2,4) and (4,2).  \n- LEFT (4,4): closer to both (2,4) and (4,2).  \n\n(4,2) is at (4,2) \u2013 from (4,4), that\u2019s 2 down.

Moving left into (4,4) avoids immediate body collision and opens path toward (4,2) apple next turn. Need to avoid trapping myself later, but currently safe.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nLEFT moves toward nearest apples while safe and keeping future moves open. UP moves away from apples without clear benefit.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf enemy died (possible if it had no safe move last turn but maybe it moved down safely), I win.

Safe.  \n- RIGHT (3,4): occupied by my own body segment (3,4) \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo RIGHT is eliminated.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Enemy collision risk**  \nEnemy head at (8,7).  \nIts possible moves: UP (8,8) empty, DOWN (8,6) empty, LEFT (7,7) empty, RIGHT (9,7) its own body.  \nNo overlap with my possible moves this turn (distance too large), so no immediate head-on collision risk.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (2,7), (8,1), (4,2), (0,9), (9,2).  \nClosest: (4,2) is distance 2 from my head (dx=2, dy=-2).  \nFrom (2,4) to (4,2): need RIGHT+DOWN generally.  \nAlso apple at (2,7) is UP 3 steps.  \nUP from (2,4) goes toward (2,7).  \nLEFT goes away from all apples except maybe (0,9) eventually but that\u2019s far.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move**  \nIf UP to (2,5):  \nNext moves from (2,5): UP (2,6), DOWN (2,4) (will be empty next turn), LEFT (1,5), RIGHT (3,5). All likely safe unless enemy moves there, but enemy far. Good mobility.  \n\nIf DOWN to (2,3):  \nNext moves: UP (2,4) empty next turn, DOWN (2,2), LEFT (1,3), RIGHT (3,3). Also good.  \n\nIf LEFT to (1,4):  \nNext moves: UP (1,5), DOWN (1,3), LEFT (0,4), RIGHT (2,4). Also fine.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term positioning**  \nMy body is mostly to the right of my head (from (3,4) to (4,1) area). Moving LEFT or UP opens space. Moving DOWN also okay but away from apple at (2,7) and (4,2).  \nApple at (4,2) is close but moving toward it now (RIGHT+DOWN) requires RIGHT which is unsafe. So maybe next turn after moving UP/DOWN/LEFT to reposition.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Avoiding traps**  \nMy tail is at (4,1). If I move DOWN to (2,3), I\u2019m moving toward my tail area but not into it. Could be okay.  \nBut UP seems better to go toward apple (2,7) and open more board space away from my coiled body.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Score advantage**  \nI have 9 apples vs enemy 5. No need to rush into risk. Staying alive and keeping options open is key.  \n\n**Decision**  \nUP seems safe, moves toward an apple (2,7), and keeps good future mobility.  \n\n**Plan for next turn**  \nFrom (2,5), consider moving toward (2,7) or (4,2) depending on safety. Avoid doubling back into body.  \n\nUP",

My safe moves (2,8), (1,7), (3,7) are far from (7,6) and (6,7), so no head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (8,1), (4,2), (0,9), (9,2), (4,7).  \nClosest apple to my head (2,7):  \n- (4,7) is 2 units away (dx=2, dy=0).  \n- (4,2) is 5 units away.  \n- (0,9) is far.  \n\nFrom (2,7):  \n- UP (2,8) moves away from (4,7).  \n- LEFT (1,7) moves slightly closer to (0,9) but far.  \n- RIGHT (3,7) moves toward (4,7) (dx=1 closer).  \n\nNo apple in immediate landing spot.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each move**  \nIf UP to (2,8):  \nNext turn safe moves: UP (2,9), LEFT (1,8), RIGHT (3,8) \u2192 3 options.  \n\nIf LEFT to (1,7):  \nNext turn safe moves: UP (1,8), DOWN (1,6), LEFT (0,7) \u2192 3 options.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (3,7):  \nNext turn safe moves: UP (3,8), DOWN (3,6), RIGHT (4,7) \u2192 3 options.  \n\nRight (3,7) leads toward apple (4,7) and also toward open right side.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term positioning**  \nMy body occupies columns 2\u20136 mostly low y.

Let's track: snake moves, head to new position, each segment shifts forward, last segment (tail) is removed. So after UP to (3,8), new body: [(3,8),(3,7),(2,7),(2,6),(2,5),(2,4),(3,4),(4,4),(5,4),(6,4),(6,3)] \u2192 tail at (6,3). So (5,3) disappears. So (3,7) will be occupied by my 2nd segment.

(2,6) is in new body as 4th segment), RIGHT (4,6). So only DOWN (3,5) and RIGHT (4,6) safe \u2192 2 options.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (4,7):  \nEat apple \u2192 grow by 1, tail stays. New body: [(4,7),(3,7),(2,7),(2,6),(2,5),(2,4),(3,4),(4,4),(5,4),(6,4),(6,3),(5,3)] (tail still (5,3) because we grew).

So UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe \u2192 3 options.  \n\nSo UP gives 3 safe next moves, DOWN gives 2, RIGHT gives 3 and eats apple.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term positioning**  \nEating apple (4,7) gets me to 11 apples, extends lead vs enemy (5 apples). Also opens path toward right-side apples (9,2) and (8,1) later. UP moves toward top wall but (0,9) apple is far left top. DOWN moves toward my own body\u2019s dense area.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Risk assessment**  \nEnemy at (7,6) is 3 cells away horizontally and vertically from (4,7). No direct threat. My own body blocks LEFT and some adjacent cells, but RIGHT is safe and beneficial.  \n\n**Plan for next turn**  \nAfter eating apple at (4,7), I\u2019ll have head at (4,7) with body extending left/down. Next turn I should avoid moving back into my body (LEFT into (3,7) unsafe). Options will be UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Likely go UP toward (0,9) or RIGHT toward (9,2) depending on enemy position. Keep enemy in mind\u2014currently enemy is far right, so moving UP may be safer to avoid potential future collision.  \n\n**Decision**  \nRIGHT eats apple, keeps good mobility, extends lead.  \n\nRIGHT",

Closest apples are probably near Coordinate (4, 2), (7, 0)\n- LEFT to (6, 5): Apples: (8, 1), (4, 2), (0, 9), (9, 2), (7, 0).\n- RIGHT to (8, 5): Apples: (8, 1), (4, 2), (0, 9), (9, 2), (7, 0).\n\nSnake #1 is at (4, 7). Based on previous move, there is a high chance for Snake #1 to go to UP(4, 8), or DOWN (4, 6) or LEFT (3, 7) or RIGHT (5,7).\nIf I move to RIGHT (8, 5), there are not much more space and easy to get hunted later. Also, pretty far away from apple.\nIf I move to DOWN (7, 4), then it is still relatively safe\nIf I move to LEFT (6, 5), then it is likely to block path.\n\nLet's calculate exact distance:\n-DOWN(7, 4) to (7, 0): Sqrt(0^2 + 4^2) = Sqrt(16) = 4\n-DOWN(7, 4) to (4, 2): Sqrt(3^2 + 2^2) = Sqrt(13) ~ 3.6\n-LEFT(6, 5) to (4, 2): Sqrt(2^2 + 3^2) = Sqrt(13) ~ 3.6\n-RIGHT(8, 5) to (9, 2): Sqrt(1^2 + 3^2) = Sqrt(10) ~ 3.16\n\nIf I were to summarize,\n- DOWN to (7, 4) is safe\n- LEFT to (6, 5) is relatively safe but not good position\n- RIGHT to (8, 5) is relatively safe and closer to apples near (9, 2)\n\nLet's predict Snake #1 moves. Snake #1 is long. It probably want to stay alive.\nSnake #1 may go to LEFT (3, 7), then there is chance of head-on collision, which is unsafe and not a high probability.\nSnake #1 may go to UP to (4, 8), so LEFT option would be a trap.\nSnake #1 may go to RIGHT to (5, 7).\n\nPlan for next turn: If I move Right, next turn probably move down.\nIf I move Left, next turn probably move down.\nIf I move Down, next turn probably move Left or Right.\n\nConsidering the risks, I will go RIGHT to (8, 5) to get closer to Apple near (9, 2).\n\nRIGHT",

Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP (7,6): occupied by its own body \u2192 unsafe for enemy.  \n- DOWN (7,4): empty.  \n- LEFT (6,5): empty.  \n- RIGHT (8,5): empty.  \n\nEnemy can go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. My safe moves (4,8), (4,6), (5,7) are not adjacent to enemy head, so no head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (8,1), (4,2), (0,9), (9,2), (7,0).  \nNo apple adjacent to my head now. Closest apples: (4,2) is 5 steps away, (0,9) is far top-left, (9,2) far right-bottom.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility after each move**  \nIf UP to (4,8):  \nNext turn body: [(4,8),(4,7),(3,7),(2,7),(2,6),(2,5),(2,4),(3,4),(4,4),(5,4),(6,4),(6,3)] (tail at (6,3) because we grew last turn).  \nNext turn safe moves from (4,8): UP (4,9), DOWN (4,7) (occupied by my body \u2192 unsafe), LEFT (3,8), RIGHT (5,8) \u2192 3 options.  \n\nIf DOWN to (4,6):  \nNext turn body: [(4,6),(4,7),(3,7),(2,7),(2,6),(2,5),(2,4),(3,4),(4,4),(5,4),(6,4),(6,3)]  \nNext turn safe moves from (4,6): UP (4,7) (occupied), DOWN (4,5), LEFT (3,6), RIGHT (5,6) \u2192 3 options.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (5,7):  \nNext turn body: [(5,7),(4,7),(3,7),(2,7),(2,6),(2,5),(2,4),(3,4),(4,4),(5,4),(6,4),(6,3)]  \nNext turn safe moves from (5,7): UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7) (occupied), RIGHT (6,7) \u2192 3 options.  \n\nAll three safe moves give 3 safe follow-up moves.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term positioning**  \n- UP moves toward top, closer to apple (0,9) but far from enemy.  \n- DOWN moves toward center/apple (4,2) but also toward my dense body area.  \n- RIGHT moves toward right side/apples (9,2),(8,1),(7,0) but also closer to enemy at (7,5). Enemy could move LEFT/DOWN toward those apples too.  \n\nEnemy is at (7,5) and likely will move toward apples (7,0) or (9,2) soon. If I go RIGHT, I risk getting blocked by enemy moving toward same apples.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Risk assessment**  \nEnemy is 3 cells away horizontally and 2 vertically from (5,7). If enemy moves LEFT to (6,5), then next turn it could move LEFT again to (5,5) or UP to (6,6) etc. Going RIGHT now doesn\u2019t put me adjacent to enemy head, but could lead to competition for apples and possible collision in 2 turns.  \n\nUP seems safest: away from enemy, toward less contested apple (0,9), and keeps options open to go left or right along top later.  \n\n**Plan for next turn**  \nAfter UP to (4,8), next turn likely go UP to (4,9) if safe, then LEFT toward (0,9) apple, while watching enemy movement. Avoid moving back into my body\u2019s dense area.  \n\n**Decision**  \nUP is safe, keeps good mobility, moves toward an apple, and avoids early confrontation with enemy.  \n\nUP",

Wait: |2-0|=2, |8-9|=1 \u2192 total 3).  \nFrom (2,8):  \n- UP (2,9) \u2192 distance to (0,9) = 2.  \n- LEFT (1,8) \u2192 distance to (0,9) = |1-0|+|8-9|=2.  \nBoth moves reduce distance equally.  \n\nOther apples: (4,2) far away, (8,1), (9,2), (7,0) are far and enemy is near them.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility**  \n- UP (2,9): next turn only DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT possible? Actually at top row (y=9), UP off board \u2192 only DOWN safe unless body blocks. My body at (3,8) blocks RIGHT? Wait, if I move UP to (2,9), my neck becomes (2,8) which is currently my head but will be my body next turn.

Check: (1,7) is free currently, (0,8) free, (1,9) free. So LEFT gives more options.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nI want apple (0,9). If I go UP now to (2,9), next turn I can go LEFT to (1,9), then LEFT to (0,9) to eat it.  \nIf I go LEFT now to (1,8), next turn I can go UP to (1,9), then LEFT to (0,9) to eat it.  \nBoth sequences take 3 moves to eat it.  \n\nBut LEFT (1,8) keeps me off the top edge one more turn, giving slightly more escape options if enemy approaches. Enemy is far away on right side currently.  \n\nAlso, apple (4,2) is reachable later after (0,9).  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Avoid dead ends**  \nAfter eating (0,9), I\u2019ll be at top-left corner. I need to plan an exit route downward quickly to avoid trapping myself. From (0,9) only DOWN (0,8) or RIGHT (1,9) possible. My body will be long, so I must ensure I don\u2019t box myself in.  \n\nGiven all that, LEFT gives more flexibility now and still reaches apple in same number of turns.  \n\n**Plan for next turn**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (1,8), next turn go UP to (1,9) toward apple (0,9), unless enemy suddenly moves into that area (unlikely). Then eat (0,9) on turn after. After that, head down toward (4,2) while avoiding my own body. Monitor enemy movement toward apples on right side.  \n\nLEFT",

NOT allowed.\n\nSo, DOWN would get me the apple at (9, 2).\nAnd LEFT would allow me to go towards other apples after one turn, however it looks like DOWN is best.\n\nPlan for next turn:\nIf I move DOWN to (9,2) now. Then the snake will be [(9,2),(9,3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6)].\nThen there are two options:\n1. LEFT to (8, 2) and this will be close to (8,1).\n2. RIGHT to (10,2) and it will be offboard and dies.\n3. UP to (9,3) and this will hit my body.\n4. DOWN to (9, 1) and closer to (8,1) and (7,0).\n\nSo for following turns, consider LEFT or DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

None overlap with enemy's possible moves this turn \u2192 no head-on collision risk.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nClosest apple is (0,9) at Manhattan distance from (1,8): |1-0| + |8-9| = 2.  \n- UP (1,9): distance to (0,9) becomes 1.  \n- LEFT (0,8): distance to (0,9) becomes 1 (up one next turn).  \n- DOWN (1,7): distance increases to 3.  \n\nSo UP and LEFT both get me closer to (0,9) equally.  \nOther apples: (4,2), (8,1), (9,2), (7,0) are farther.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future mobility**  \n- UP (1,9): from top row, only DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT possible next turn. My body will be at (1,8) blocking DOWN, so only LEFT (0,9) and RIGHT (2,9) available \u2192 2 options.  \n- LEFT (0,8): from left edge, only UP (0,9), DOWN (0,7), RIGHT (1,8) possible. My body at (1,8) blocks RIGHT, so only UP and DOWN \u2192 2 options.  \n- DOWN (1,7): from interior, all four directions possible next turn except possibly blocked by body: UP (1,8) blocked, LEFT (0,7) free, DOWN (1,6) free, RIGHT (2,7) free \u2192 3 options.  \n\nDOWN gives more future mobility, but moves away from immediate apple.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nI want to eat (0,9) next turn if possible. If I go UP now to (1,9), next turn I can go LEFT to (0,9) to eat it. If I go LEFT now to (0,8), next turn I can go UP to (0,9) to eat it. Both sequences eat it on turn 40.  \n\nBut after eating at (0,9), I\u2019ll be at top-left corner with a long body behind me. Exiting safely will be tricky. From (0,9) only DOWN (0,8) or RIGHT (1,9) possible. My body will occupy (1,9) if I go UP now, so if I go UP now then eat apple next turn, my body will be at (1,9) blocking RIGHT exit, forcing me DOWN only. That\u2019s risky if DOWN gets blocked later.  \n\nIf I go LEFT now to (0,8), then UP to (0,9) to eat apple, my body will be at (0,8) blocking DOWN exit, forcing me RIGHT only. That\u2019s also risky.  \n\nMaybe I should delay eating (0,9) by one turn to set up a safer exit path. Going DOWN now to (1,7) keeps me flexible, avoids corner trap, and I can still reach (0,9) later via (0,8) or (1,9).  \n\nEnemy snake is far away on right side, not an immediate threat to top-left apple.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Avoid dead ends**  \nMy body is long (length 12), so I need to avoid boxing myself. The top-left corner is dangerous once I enter it. Better to approach it with an escape route planned.  \n\nGiven that, DOWN (1,7) seems safest for future options, even though it temporarily increases distance to nearest apple. I can then loop around toward (0,9) from below or left later.\n\n**Plan for next turn**  \nMove DOWN to (1,7) to maintain mobility, then reassess. Possibly head toward (4,2) afterward, which is also a valuable apple. Keep enemy in mind\u2014it\u2019s near (9,2) and (8,1) apples but far from me.\n\nDOWN",

Moving DOWN opens space toward bottom-left where there\u2019s apple (0,6) and possibly (7,0) later.

Body becomes: head (0, 6), then old (1, 6) becomes neck, then (1, 7), etc.  \n- Next turn possible moves from (0, 6):  \n  - UP (0, 7): occupied? Next turn after growth, (1, 7) is still body segment (old head position becomes neck), so (0, 7) is free currently. Wait, check: current body list includes (1, 7) yes, but (0, 7) is not in body list. So UP free.  \n  - DOWN (0, 5): free.  \n  - RIGHT (1, 6): will be occupied by neck next turn \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - LEFT out of bounds.  \nSo only UP and DOWN available next turn if I go LEFT now.  \n\nIf DOWN to (1, 5):  \n- No apple eaten.  \n- Next turn head at (1, 5), neck at (1, 6).  \n- Possible moves from (1, 5):  \n  - UP (1, 6) \u2192 neck \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - DOWN (1, 4) \u2192 free.  \n  - LEFT (0, 5) \u2192 free.  \n  - RIGHT (2, 5) \u2192 occupied by my body? Body list includes (2, 5) (11th segment currently). After move, body shifts: (2, 5) becomes (2, 5) still in body? Let\u2019s trace: current body: (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4) are last three segments. After moving DOWN, head to (1, 5), tail (2, 4) disappears, (2, 5) shifts to (2, 6)? Wait, snake movement: each segment moves into previous segment\u2019s position. So (2, 4) is tail and will be removed (since no apple). (2, 5) moves to (2, 6)\u2019s old position, but (2, 6) moves to (2, 7)\u2019s old position, etc. Actually let\u2019s simulate:  \nCurrent body: head (1, 6), then (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4).  \nMove DOWN: new head (1, 5). Neck = old head (1, 6). Then:  \nSegment 2 (old 1, 7) \u2192 (1, 6)  \nSegment 3 (old 1, 8) \u2192 (1, 7)  \nSegment 4 (old 2, 8) \u2192 (1, 8)  \nSegment 5 (old 3, 8) \u2192 (2, 8)  \nSegment 6 (old 4, 8) \u2192 (3, 8)  \nSegment 7 (old 4, 7) \u2192 (4, 8)  \nSegment 8 (old 3, 7) \u2192 (4, 7)  \nSegment 9 (old 2, 7) \u2192 (3, 7)  \nSegment 10 (old 2, 6) \u2192 (2, 7)  \nSegment 11 (old 2, 5) \u2192 (2, 6)  \nSegment 12 (old 2, 4) \u2192 (2, 5) \u2014 tail position.  \nSo next turn body:  \n(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5).  \n\nFrom (1, 5) next turn:  \nUP (1, 6) \u2192 occupied by neck \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (1, 4) \u2192 free.  \nLEFT (0, 5) \u2192 free.  \nRIGHT (2, 5) \u2192 occupied by my tail \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo only DOWN and LEFT available next turn if I go DOWN now.  \n\nSo both safe moves now give only 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term planning**  \nEating apple now puts me at 12 apples vs enemy\u2019s 6. But going to (0, 6) means next turn only UP/DOWN moves, which could be risky if enemy approaches later. However, enemy is far away at (9, 1).  \n\nAlso, apple at (0, 6) is close to left wall; after eating it, I\u2019ll be longer and might get trapped near wall if not careful. But I can go UP to (0, 7) next turn, then right later.  \n\nIf I don\u2019t eat it now, enemy might get it? No, enemy far. But maybe I should eat it to increase lead.  \n\nBut safety: from (0, 6) next turn, UP (0, 7) is safe, DOWN (0, 5) safe. That\u2019s okay.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Avoid dead ends**  \nMy body occupies much of top-left area. Moving DOWN avoids wall but gives no apple. Moving LEFT gets apple but sticks to left edge.  \n\nGiven my long body, maybe I should eat apple to use space efficiently? Actually, if I eat apple, my tail stays where it was (last segment not removed), so I occupy more cells, which could limit future mobility. But apple is at edge, so growth there might not hurt much.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nBoth moves safe this turn. Eating apple helps toward 50-apple goal and extends lead. Enemy not near. Risk of being trapped next turn is minimal because from (0, 6) I can go UP to (0, 7) which is open, then possibly RIGHT to (1, 7) later (but (1, 7) will be my body next turn if I go LEFT now? Let\u2019s check: after moving LEFT to (0, 6) and eating apple, body becomes: (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4) \u2014 wait, growth means tail stays, so (2, 4) remains. So (1, 7) is occupied. So from (0, 6) next turn, UP to (0, 7) free, DOWN to (0, 5) free, RIGHT to (1, 6) is neck \u2192 unsafe. So indeed only UP/DOWN. That\u2019s a bit tight, but after that, from (0, 7) I\u2019d have UP (0, 8) free, DOWN (0, 6) body, LEFT out, RIGHT (1, 7) body \u2192 only UP. That\u2019s worse. So maybe eating apple now leads to reduced mobility quickly.  \n\nMaybe better to go DOWN now, then next turn go LEFT to (0, 5) or DOWN to (1, 4), keeping options open. Apple (0, 6) will still be there next turn if enemy doesn\u2019t take it.  \n\nGiven enemy is at (9, 1), it would take many turns to reach (0, 6). So I can delay eating it safely.  \n\nSo I choose DOWN to keep more future flexibility.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nMove DOWN now to (1, 5). Next turn consider going LEFT to (0, 5) or DOWN to (1, 4) to eventually loop toward apple (0, 6) from below, avoiding wall trap.  \n\nLEFT",

Check: (1, 7) is in body list above (after neck (0, 6) and (1, 6)). Yes, so unsafe.  \nSo only UP available next turn if I go UP now \u2192 very risky (only one safe move).  \n\nIf DOWN to (0, 5):  \n- No apple eaten.  \n- Next turn head at (0, 5), neck (0, 6).  \n- Body after moving: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4) is removed (since no growth). Wait: current body length 12 segments plus head = total 13 segments. Move without growth \u2192 tail (2, 4) disappears, so new body length still 13? Actually: head moves, each segment shifts forward, last segment removed. So new body: (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5).  \n- From (0, 5) next turn:  \n  - UP (0, 6): occupied by neck \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - DOWN (0, 4): free.  \n  - LEFT out \u2192 unsafe.  \n  - RIGHT (1, 5): free (not in new body list).  \nSo DOWN and RIGHT available next turn if I go DOWN now \u2192 better than only UP.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk of trapping myself**  \nGoing UP now leads to only UP next turn, then from (0, 8) only UP again to (0, 9) (apple there), then at (0, 9) only DOWN (since left/right out, up out, down to (0, 8) body). That\u2019s a dead end after eating (0, 9). Too risky.  \n\nGoing DOWN now keeps 2 options next turn, more flexible. Apple (0, 7) will remain unless enemy gets it, but enemy is far at (8, 1). I can possibly circle back later.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Enemy movement consideration**  \nEnemy head at (8, 1). It might move toward apples (7, 0) or (4, 2) or (3, 4). It\u2019s unlikely to reach (0, 7) soon. So delaying eating (0, 7) is safe.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN gives better future mobility. UP leads to quick trap. Choose DOWN.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nMove DOWN to (0, 5). Next turn, either RIGHT to (1, 5) or DOWN to (0, 4) to open space, eventually approach apple (0, 7) from below after maneuvering.  \n\nDOWN",

This will be safe.\n*   LEFT (1, 5). This will collide with its body.\n*   RIGHT (3, 5). This will be safe.\n\nSo Snake #1 can go DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nTherefore, I believe the best move is to go DOWN and grab the apple, which is a much better reward in the short term.\n\nSTRATEGY NOTE: Collect (7,0) apple. On next turn, consider whether to move towards (4,2) or (3,4), based on where Snake #1 is moving. Avoid getting trapped on the right side.\n\nDOWN",

Possible moves from (2,5):  \n- **UP** \u2192 (2,6) \u2013 currently empty (check board: at (2,6) is \u2018.\u2019).  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2,4) \u2013 currently empty (board shows \u2018.\u2019 at (2,4)).  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1,5) \u2013 this is my own body segment (first after head). Immediate death.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,5) \u2013 currently empty (board shows \u2018.\u2019).  \n\nSo **LEFT** is eliminated.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Check for other immediate death risks (enemy bodies, enemy heads\u2019 possible moves):  \n\n**Enemy snake #0:** Head at (7,1), body: (7,2), (8,2), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4).  \nEnemy could move UP to (7,2) (own body) \u2013 not safe for them.  \nEnemy possible moves:  \n- UP (7,2) \u2013 own body \u2192 dead for them if they choose it.  \n- DOWN (7,0) \u2013 board shows \u2018.\u2019 but is (7,0) an apple? Yes, apple at (7,0). That\u2019s safe for them unless they hit us.  \n- LEFT (6,1) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT (8,1) \u2013 own body \u2192 dead.  \n\nSo enemy likely won\u2019t move UP or RIGHT (suicide), so they will choose DOWN or LEFT.  \n\nNow check if any of my moves could land on a cell that enemy head might move into:  \n- My UP (2,6) \u2013 enemy can\u2019t reach.  \n- My DOWN (2,4) \u2013 enemy can\u2019t reach.  \n- My RIGHT (3,5) \u2013 enemy can\u2019t reach.  \n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Check for walls:  \nAll moves UP/DOWN/RIGHT are within 0\u20139.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Apples reachable soon:  \nApples: (4,2), (0,9), (7,0), (3,4), (0,7)  \n\nClosest is (3,4) \u2013 from (2,5): DOWN (2,4) then RIGHT (3,4) gets it in 2 turns.  \nFrom (3,5): DOWN (3,4) gets it in 1 turn.  \n\nSo **RIGHT** now puts me closer to (3,4) next turn.  \nBut check if (3,5) is safe for next turn options:  \nFrom (3,5), possible moves next turn: UP (3,6) empty, DOWN (3,4) apple, LEFT (2,5) empty (but was head this turn, will be empty next turn since snake moves), RIGHT (4,5) empty. So 3+ safe moves next turn if we go RIGHT now.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Future safety:  \nIf I go **UP** to (2,6):  \nNext turn options: UP (2,7) my body (tail might move? Tail is at (2,7) now, but snake moves, so next turn tail moves to (3,7)? Let\u2019s check:  \nCurrent tail: (2,7). If I move UP, head to (2,6), body shifts: new body = (2,6) head, then (2,5) old head, then (1,5), (0,5), (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (4,7), (3,7). So tail (3,7) next turn.  \nSo (2,7) will be empty next turn. But (2,7) is not in next turn\u2019s body except if I go UP again to (2,7) next turn \u2013 that\u2019s fine.  \nActually from (2,6) next turn: UP (2,7) empty, DOWN (2,5) empty, LEFT (1,6) body (yes, (1,6) is in body next turn), RIGHT (3,6) empty. So LEFT is blocked.  \n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (2,4):  \nNext turn body: head (2,4), then (2,5), (1,5), (0,5), (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (4,7), tail (3,7).  \nFrom (2,4): UP (2,5) body segment (yes, (2,5) will be body next turn) \u2013 so UP blocked. DOWN (2,3) empty, LEFT (1,4) empty, RIGHT (3,4) apple. So only 3 moves but UP blocked.  \n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (3,5):  \nNext turn body: head (3,5), then (2,5), (1,5), (0,5), (0,6), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (4,7), tail (3,7).  \nFrom (3,5): UP (3,6) empty, DOWN (3,4) apple, LEFT (2,5) body (blocked), RIGHT (4,5) empty. So 3 moves, LEFT blocked.  \n\nAll three safe moves give 3 options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Which is best for apple pathing?  \nRIGHT gets me to (3,4) apple in 1 move next turn (DOWN).  \nDOWN gets me to (3,4) apple in 2 moves (RIGHT next turn).  \nUP gets me farther from nearest apple.  \n\nSo RIGHT seems best for apple collection.  \n\n---\n\n### 7. Long-term plan note for next turn:  \nFrom (3,5), go DOWN to eat apple (3,4) unless unsafe. Then from (3,4), consider path toward (4,2) or center. Keep enemy in mind\u2014they\u2019re on bottom right, not an immediate threat but could cut off bottom apples later.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nRIGHT",

My score is 8 apples, enemy score is 12.\n\nPossible moves are:\n\n*   UP to (7, 1). This hits my body, so this would kill me.\n*   DOWN to (7, -1). This goes off the board, so this would kill me.\n*   LEFT to (6, 0). This looks okay.\n*   RIGHT to (8, 0).

If I go RIGHT, I go to (8,0).\n\nLet's consider the state of the board and try to look at where i might go next turn. I want to get towards apples.

I am somewhat isolated from the apples.\n\nSo, going RIGHT seems like it gives me more options and opportunities.\n\nSTRATEGY NOTE: Move RIGHT to (8,0) towards more options on subsequent moves.

          "rationale": "Let\u2019s examine the current situation.  \n\n**My snake (ID 1):**  \nHead at (3, 4).  \nBody: [(3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7)]  \nLength: 14 segments (head + 13 body).  \n\n**Apples:** (4,2), (0,9), (0,7), (0,3), (4,3)  \n\n**Enemy snake #0:** Head at (8,0), body: [(7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,2), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3)], length 9.  \n\n---\n\n**Check possible moves from (3,4):**  \n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (3,5) \u2192 occupied by my own body (second segment). \u2192 **Death**.  \n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 currently empty on board (board shows empty at (3,3) except maybe apple later? Wait, board at y=3: column 3 is empty? Actually apple at (0,3) far left, (4,3) far right from head. (3,3) is free.) Check body: not in my body list. Enemy body: no. Enemy head could move there? Let\u2019s check later.  \n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 empty on board, not in my body, not in enemy body.  \n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 empty on board, not in my body, not in enemy body.  \n\nSo safe immediate moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy head (8,0) possible moves:**  \nFrom (8,0):  \n- UP \u2192 (8,1) \u2192 occupied by enemy body (8,1 is in its body). \u2192 Death for enemy.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board (y=-1). \u2192 Death.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,0) \u2192 occupied by enemy body (second segment). \u2192 Death.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,0) \u2192 empty on board, not in enemy body.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is RIGHT to (9,0).  \n\nThat means enemy will be at (9,0) next turn, far from me. No immediate threat of head-on collision or moving into my path from my possible next cells.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n- (4,3) is 1 step down and 1 right from (3,4) \u2192 DOWN+RIGHT or RIGHT+DOWN.  \n- (4,2) is 2 steps down and 1 right from (3,4).  \n- (0,9), (0,7), (0,3) are far left, require going through my own body path.  \n\nBest apple to target short-term: (4,3) because it\u2019s close and reachable safely.  \n\n---\n\n**Check each safe move for future safety and apple access:**  \n\n- **DOWN to (3,3)**: From there, possible next moves: UP back to (3,4) (occupied next turn? No, body moves forward, (3,4) vacated unless growth). Actually if we eat apple this turn, we grow, so tail doesn\u2019t move. Wait \u2014 we are not eating apple at (3,3) \u2014 no apple there. So no growth, so tail moves forward one. Body list next turn would shift: head at (3,3), body starts at old (3,4) which becomes first body segment, then (3,5), etc., and last body segment (old tail at (3,7)) disappears. So (3,4) is occupied next turn if we move DOWN? Let\u2019s check: old head at (3,4) moves to (3,3), body segments follow: first body segment becomes old head position (3,4), second becomes old (3,5), etc. So yes, (3,4) is occupied next turn.  \n\nFrom (3,3) next turn:  \nPossible moves: UP \u2192 (3,4) occupied by my body \u2192 not safe. LEFT \u2192 (2,3) free. RIGHT \u2192 (4,3) apple! DOWN \u2192 (3,2) free. So from (3,3) we\u2019d have LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN safe. RIGHT eats apple (4,3). Good option.  \n\n- **LEFT to (2,4)**: From there next turn: possible moves: UP (2,5) occupied by my body (old segment). DOWN (2,3) free. LEFT (1,4) free. RIGHT (3,4) occupied by my body next turn. So safe: DOWN, LEFT. That\u2019s only 2 safe moves, less flexible.  \n\n- **RIGHT to (4,4)**: From there next turn: UP (4,5) free. DOWN (4,3) apple \u2014 but is it safe next turn? Possibly. LEFT (3,4) occupied by my body next turn. RIGHT (5,4) free. So safe: UP, DOWN, RIGHT \u2014 3 safe moves. DOWN eats apple immediately next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Compare:**  \nDOWN \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 next turn can eat apple at (4,3) by moving RIGHT.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 next turn can eat apple at (4,3) by moving DOWN.  \n\nBoth put us adjacent to apple next turn. But DOWN puts us farther from other apples and near left side which is crowded with my body. RIGHT puts us at (4,4) with more open space to right and up.  \n\nAlso, (4,4) is closer to center, more future options.  \n\nEnemy is far right bottom, no threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (4,4) after moving RIGHT this turn, next turn DOWN to (4,3) eats apple, then we can consider going toward (4,2) or up toward (4,5) to avoid trapping. Keep an eye on enemy path \u2014 they\u2019re stuck along bottom right edge, may run out of space soon. We have a lead in apples (13 vs 8), focus on maintaining safe growth and space.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nRIGHT  \n\nRIGHT",

Death.  \n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (5, 4) \u2192 empty, not in my body, not in enemy body. Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy head (9, 0) possible moves:**  \nFrom (9, 0):  \n- UP \u2192 (9, 1) \u2192 occupied by enemy body (segment 7). Death.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 0) \u2192 occupied by enemy body (segment 2). Death.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 death.  \n\nEnemy has **no safe moves** this turn.

New body next turn: head at (4, 3), body = old head (4, 4) + old body except tail stays.  \nThat means (4, 4) becomes body segment 1.  \n\nWill we collide with enemy head if it moves? Enemy has no safe moves, so it will die, not move into us.  \n\nSo DOWN is safe and wins immediately.  \n\n---\n\n**UP** or **RIGHT** also win immediately, but DOWN gets an extra apple point (now 14 apples).  \n\nSince game ends immediately when all opponents dead, score matters if game ends now: 14 vs 8.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nMove **DOWN** to eat apple, gain 1 apple, and win.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nDOWN",
