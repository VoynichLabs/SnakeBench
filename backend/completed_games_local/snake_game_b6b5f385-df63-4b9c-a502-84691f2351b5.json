          "rationale": "First, I need to understand the current board state. My snake (ID 0) is at (5,6) with no body, so I'm just a single segment. The enemy snake #1 is at (6,3) with no body. Apples are at (7,1), (8,5), (8,0), (1,0), (2,6).\n\nI must choose a move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. I need to consider which moves are safe.\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- UP: from (5,6) to (5,7). Is this on the board? y=7 is within 0-9, x=5 is within 0-9. So yes. Now, is there any snake body? Currently, no other snakes are at (5,7). Enemy snake is at (6,3), so not there. I also need to consider if moving into my own body, but since I have no body, it's fine. Also, moving backwards? Since I have no body, moving in any direction isn't directly backwards into my body. So UP seems safe.\n\n- DOWN: from (5,6) to (5,5). On board? y=5 is within 0-9, so yes. No snakes at (5,5). Enemy at (6,3), so safe. So DOWN seems safe.\n\n- LEFT: from (5,6) to (4,6). On board? x=4 is within 0-9, so yes. No snakes at (4,6). Safe.\n\n- RIGHT: from (5,6) to (6,6). On board? x=6 is within 0-9, so yes. But is there a snake? Enemy snake head is at (6,3), so not at (6,6). But I need to consider if moving into another snake's body? Enemy has no body, so only the head matters. Also, for head-on collision: if both snakes move into the same cell, both die. But enemy is at (6,3), so if I move to (6,6), and enemy moves, but enemy might move to some other direction. I don't know enemy's move yet, but since we move simultaneously, I have to assume the worst case. But in the rules, it says \"avoid likely head-on collisions\", but I don't know what enemy will do. However, since enemy is at (6,3), which is 3 units away in y-direction, it's unlikely that enemy would move directly to (6,6) in one turn, as that would require moving UP three times? From y=3 to y=6, that's three moves up, but in one turn, it can only move one step. So from (6,3), if enemy moves UP, it goes to (6,4), not (6,6). So no direct head-on collision with me moving to (6,6). But let's confirm: from (6,3), possible moves: UP to (6,4), DOWN to (6,2), LEFT to (5,3), RIGHT to (7,3). None of these are (6,6). So moving RIGHT to (6,6) seems safe from immediate collision. But I should also consider if there are apples or something, but for safety, it seems ok.\n\nSo all four directions seem safe? But I need to check if any move would kill me immediately.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if moving into an apple, but that doesn't kill me, it grows me. So for safety, it's fine.\n\nBut let's list the apples: (7,1), (8,5), (8,0), (1,0), (2,6). From my position (5,6), which apples are close? (2,6) is at x=2,y=6, so left 3 steps. (8,5) is at x=8,y=5, so right 3 steps and down 1, but since I move only one step, not immediately reachable. Similarly, (7,1) is far, (8,0) far, (1,0) far.\n\nBut I should not only think about immediate safety but also about future moves and not getting trapped.\n\nSince I have no body, I have a lot of freedom. But I need to plan for growth.\n\nNow, let's think about the enemy snake. It's at (6,3), and it might be moving towards apples. Apples near enemy: (7,1) is close? From (6,3) to (7,1): down and right? But (7,1) is at y=1, so down 2 steps and right 1. But also (8,5) is up and right, etc. But I don't know its strategy.\n\nI should consider moving towards apples. But since apples are scattered, I need to choose which one to go for.\n\nBut first, ensure I survive.\n\nFrom the board, I see that at (2,6) there is an apple, and since I'm at (5,6), moving LEFT would bring me closer to (2,6). But (2,6) is three steps left, so if I move left, I go to (4,6), then to (3,6), then to (2,6). But I need to check if there are obstacles.\n\nLooking at the board from row 6: in the board state, row 6 is: . . A . . 0 . . . . so at (2,6) there is an apple? From the board: row 6: columns 0 to 9: 0:., 1:., 2:A, 3:., 4:., 5:0, 6:., 7:., 8:., 9:. so at (2,6) there is an apple, yes. And my head is at (5,6), so (2,6) is left three steps.\n\nSimilarly, at (8,5) there is an apple, from row 5: . . . . . . . . A . so at (8,5) apple. From me at (5,6), to (8,5): right three steps and down one.\n\nBut I have to move one step at a time.\n\nNow, back to immediate moves: all seem safe, but I need to see if any move leads to a dead end or something.\n\nSince I have no body, I don't have to worry about trapping myself yet.\n\nBut I should consider the enemy's position. The enemy is at (6,3), which is below and to the right of me. If I move RIGHT, I go to (6,6), which is directly above the enemy? Enemy at (6,3), so same x, y difference of 3. If I move RIGHT, I'm at (6,6), and if enemy moves UP, it goes to (6,4), so still no collision. But if I stay at (6,6) and enemy moves multiple times? But we move turn by turn, so after this turn, I'm at (6,6) and enemy at (6,4) if it moves UP, then next turn, I might move, and it might move, so eventually, if both go vertically, we might meet at same x but different y, but since we move simultaneously, if we are at same x and y difference, we don't collide unless we move into same cell.\n\nBut for now, it seems safe.\n\nSimilarly, if I move DOWN, to (5,5), which is closer to apple at (8,5)? But (8,5) is right and down, but from (5,5) to (8,5) is right three steps, so same as from (5,6) but one step down, so not directly closer? From (5,6) to (8,5): delta x=3, delta y= -1, so Manhattan distance 4. From (5,5) to (8,5): delta x=3, delta y=0, distance 3. So moving DOWN to (5,5) reduces distance to (8,5) from 4 to 3, while moving LEFT to (4,6) reduces distance to (2,6) from 3 to 2, and to (8,5) from 4 to 5? Let's calculate distances.\n\nTo apple at (2,6): from (5,6), distance |5-2| + |6-6| = 3. From (4,6), distance |4-2| + |6-6| = 2. From (5,5), distance |5-2| + |5-6| = 3+1=4. So moving LEFT reduces distance to (2,6) to 2, moving DOWN increases it to 4.\n\nTo apple at (8,5): from (5,6), distance |5-8| + |6-5| = 3+1=4. From (4,6), |4-8| + |6-5| =4+1=5. From (5,5), |5-8| + |5-5| =3+0=3. So moving DOWN reduces distance to (8,5) to 3.\n\nTo apple at (7,1): from (5,6), distance |5-7| + |6-1| =2+5=7. From (4,6), |4-7| + |6-1| =3+5=8. From (5,5), |5-7| + |5-1| =2+4=6. So moving DOWN reduces distance to (7,1) to 6.\n\nSimilarly for other apples, but (1,0) and (8,0) are far.\n\nSo from a distance perspective, moving DOWN is good for apples at (8,5) and (7,1), while moving LEFT is good for (2,6).\n\nBut I need to consider which apple is more accessible and not contested.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake might be going for some apples. Let's see the enemy position: at (6,3). Apples near enemy: (7,1) is close? Distance from (6,3) to (7,1): |6-7| + |3-1| =1+2=3. To (8,5): |6-8| + |3-5| =2+2=4. To (8,0): |6-8| + |3-0| =2+3=5. To (1,0): |6-1| + |3-0| =5+3=8. To (2,6): |6-2| + |3-6| =4+3=7. So likely, the enemy might go for (7,1) or (8,5).\n\nIf I go for (2,6), which is closer to me, and enemy might not contest it immediately.\n\nBut let's see the board: from (5,6) to (2,6), the path is clear? From row 6, columns 2 to 5: at col2 apple, col3 empty, col4 empty, col5 my head? But my head is moving, so if I move left, I go to (4,6), then to (3,6), then to (2,6). But is there any snake? Enemy is at (6,3), so no. So the path is clear for now.\n\nSimilarly, for moving down to (5,5), then towards (8,5), but from (5,5) to (8,5), we have row 5: from col5 to col8: at col5? Row 5: from the board, row 5: . . . . . . . . A . so columns 0:.,1:.,2:.,3:.,4:.,5:.,6:.,7:.,8:A,9:. so from (5,5) to (8,5), it's all empty except (8,5) has apple. But we need to check if there are other snakes? Enemy at (6,3), so not on that path.\n\nBut moving down to (5,5) might bring me closer to the enemy? Enemy at (6,3), so if I'm at (5,5), distance to enemy is |5-6| + |5-3| =1+2=3, whereas from (5,6) it was |5-6| + |6-3| =1+3=4, so slightly closer, but still not immediate threat.\n\nNow, I need to think about head-on collision. Since enemy might move, I should avoid moving towards where enemy might move. But I don't know enemy's move.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the most valuable move in terms of apple access and safety.\n\nAlso, from the win conditions, since the game lasts 150 turns, and we are at turn 0, I have plenty of time, so I should focus on safely collecting apples.\n\nBut I need to choose a move now.\n\nLet me list the safe moves and their benefits:\n\n- UP: to (5,7). This moves me away from most apples? From (5,7), distance to (2,6) is |5-2| + |7-6| =3+1=4, worse. To (8,5) is |5-8| + |7-5| =3+2=5, worse. To (7,1) is |5-7| + |7-1| =2+6=8, worse. So moving UP seems to increase distance to all apples except possibly new apples that might appear, but currently, no apple in that direction. Also, from (5,7), I might get trapped if I go up further, but since board is 10x10, I can go up to y=9, so not trapped immediately. But it doesn't help me get closer to any apple. So probably not beneficial.\n\n- DOWN: to (5,5). As above, reduces distance to (8,5) to 3, to (7,1) to 6. Also, from (5,5), I can move towards (8,5) or towards (7,1) via right and down. So better.\n\n- LEFT: to (4,6). Reduces distance to (2,6) to 2, and from there, I can go to (2,6) in two more moves. Also, from (4,6), I might go to other apples? But (2,6) is close, so good.\n\n- RIGHT: to (6,6). This moves me closer to (8,5)? From (6,6) to (8,5): |6-8| + |6-5| =2+1=3, while from (5,6) it was 4, so slightly closer. But also, from (6,6), I might be closer to enemy? Enemy at (6,3), so distance |6-6| + |6-3| =3, same as from (5,6) which was 4? From (5,6) to (6,3): |5-6| + |6-3| =1+3=4, from (6,6) to (6,3): |6-6| + |6-3| =0+3=3, so closer, but still not immediate. Also, if I move RIGHT, I go to (6,6), and if enemy moves UP, it goes to (6,4), then next turn, if I move DOWN, I go to (6,5), and enemy might move UP to (6,5), causing head-on collision? But I don't know what enemy will do. So moving RIGHT might increase risk of collision with enemy if we both move vertically towards each other.\n\nBut since enemy is at (6,3), and I at (6,6), if both move towards each other, I move DOWN to (6,5), enemy moves UP to (6,4), then no collision, and then next turn, I move DOWN to (6,4), enemy moves UP to (6,3), still no collision? Let's see: after my first move to (6,6), enemy at (6,3). If I move DOWN to (6,5), and enemy moves UP to (6,4), then we are at (6,5) and (6,4), no collision. If I move DOWN again to (6,4), and enemy moves UP to (6,3), no collision. If I move DOWN to (6,3), and enemy moves UP to (6,4), no collision. So only if we both move into the same cell at the same time. From (6,6) and (6,3), the only way we collide is if we both move towards each other and meet at (6,4.5)? But since we move in integer steps, if I move DOWN from (6,6) to (6,5), and enemy moves UP from (6,3) to (6,4), no collision. If I move DOWN to (6,5), enemy moves UP to (6,4), then next turn I move DOWN to (6,4), but if enemy moves UP to (6,3), no collision. If enemy moves UP to (6,4) when I am at (6,5), and I move DOWN to (6,4), then we both move into (6,4) at the same turn? Yes! That would cause head-on collision and both die.\n\nSo, if I move to (6,6) and then continue moving DOWN, and enemy moves UP, we could collide at (6,4) if we both move into it simultaneously.\n\nFor example, turn 0: I at (5,6), enemy at (6,3). I move RIGHT to (6,6), enemy moves? Suppose enemy moves UP to (6,4). Then after turn 0, I at (6,6), enemy at (6,4).\n\nTurn 1: I move DOWN to (6,5), enemy moves UP to (6,3)? Or to (6,4)? If enemy moves UP from (6,4) to (6,5)? But (6,4) to UP is (6,5)? Yes, y increases up. So if enemy moves UP from (6,4) to (6,5), and I move DOWN from (6,6) to (6,5), then we both move into (6,5) at the same turn, collision and both die.\n\nSo, if I move RIGHT now, and enemy moves UP, then in the next turn, if I move DOWN and enemy moves UP, we collide. So there is a risk.\n\nBut enemy might not move UP; it might move in another direction. But since I don't know, I should avoid moves that might lead to high risk of collision.\n\nSimilarly, if I move DOWN, I go to (5,5), and enemy at (6,3). Distance is 3, so less risk of immediate collision.\n\nIf I move LEFT, I go to (4,6), enemy at (6,3), distance |4-6| + |6-3| =2+3=5, so even farther.\n\nSo, moving LEFT or DOWN seems safer than RIGHT.\n\nMoving UP seems safe but not beneficial.\n\nNow, between LEFT and DOWN, which is better?\n\nLEFT: moves towards apple at (2,6), which is 3 steps away, and after moving left, I can reach it in two more moves. Also, from (2,6), there might be other apples? But currently, no other apples nearby. But after eating an apple, a new apple might appear, but I don't know.\n\nDOWN: moves towards apple at (8,5), which is 4 steps away? From (5,5) to (8,5) is 3 steps right, so total from (5,6) to (8,5) is 4 steps? But from (5,5) it's 3 steps, so after moving down, I need three moves to reach (8,5). Also, there is apple at (7,1), which is farther.\n\nBut apple at (8,5) is at the edge, and from there, I might go to other apples.\n\nBut let's see the board: from (5,5), moving right towards (8,5), all cells are empty until (8,5), so I can reach it in three moves without obstacle.\n\nSimilarly, from (4,6), moving left towards (2,6), all cells are empty until (2,6)? From row 6, columns 4,3,2: from board, row 6: col4:., col3:., col2:A, so yes, empty. So I can reach (2,6) in two moves after moving left? After moving left to (4,6), then I can move left to (3,6), then to (2,6). So in two more moves after this move.\n\nBut if I move down to (5,5), then I need to move right three times to (8,5), so three moves after this move.\n\nSo, moving left allows me to get an apple faster? But I have to consider that after I move, the enemy also moves, and I might not be able to get the apple if enemy goes for it? But apples are at fixed positions, and multiple apples, so no immediate competition for (2,6) since enemy is at (6,3) far away.\n\nSimilarly, for (8,5), enemy might go for it, but from (6,3) to (8,5) is 4 steps, while from me after moving down, it's 3 steps, so I might get there first if I move down and then right.\n\nBut let's calculate the steps:\n\nIf I move LEFT now to (4,6), then I can go to (3,6) next, then (2,6) and eat apple. So in two turns, I eat apple at (2,6).\n\nIf I move DOWN now to (5,5), then I go to (6,5) next, then (7,5), then (8,5) and eat apple. So in three turns, I eat apple at (8,5).\n\nSo moving left gets me an apple faster.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple, I grow, so my body will be behind me, but since I'm moving towards the apple, after eating, I need to move away, but that should be fine.\n\nNow, what about the enemy? If I go for (2,6), enemy might go for other apples, but since I get an apple quickly, I gain a point early.\n\nBut I need to ensure that after eating, I don't get trapped. From (2,6), after eating, I have a body at (2,6)? When I eat, I grow, so after moving to (2,6), I consume the apple, and my tail doesn't move immediately? Let's recall how growth works: when you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment, meaning that after the move, your body extends by one segment, so the tail does not move in that turn? Actually, in standard Snake, when you eat an apple, the snake grows, so the tail does not move forward, so the body length increases.\n\nIn this game, as per the rules: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point.\" So after moving to the apple, your body gets longer. Since I have no body now, after eating, I will have a body segment at my previous position? Let's think: when I move to the apple, my head moves to the apple, and since I grow, the tail remains where it was? But in the coordinate list, after moving, the head is at the new position, and the body includes the previous head position? Since I have no body, after moving to apple, I will have a body consisting of the cell I was at before moving? For example, from (5,6) to (4,6) if I move left and eat apple? But in this case, if I move left to (4,6), but (4,6) is not an apple? From the board, at (4,6) there is no apple? From row 6, col4 is ., so no apple. The apple is at (2,6). So if I move to (4,6), no apple, so I don't grow. I need to move to (2,6) to eat.\n\nSo after I move to (4,6), I have no body, head at (4,6). Then I move to (3,6), no body, head at (3,6). Then I move to (2,6), which has apple, so I eat, and I grow. So after moving to (2,6), my head is at (2,6), and my body? Since I had no body before, after growing, my body will consist of the previous head positions? But in standard snake, when you grow, the tail doesn't move, so the body extends from the previous position. Since I had only head, after moving to apple, my body should include the position I was at before moving, so from (3,6) to (2,6), after move, head at (2,6), body includes (3,6)? But since I was only head, after growing, my body is one segment at (3,6)? But let's see the rule: \"the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one\" so after eating, the snake becomes two segments: head at (2,6) and body at (3,6)? But when I move from (3,6) to (2,6), after the move, if I eat, I grow, so the tail remains at (3,6)? But initially, I have no tail, so after eating, I have a tail at (3,6)? Actually, in snake games, when you have only head, and you eat, you become two segments: head and tail at the same place? No, typically, when you move, you add the new head, and if you don't eat, you remove the tail. If you eat, you don't remove the tail, so the snake lengthens.\n\nIn this case, since I have no body, before moving, I am just at (5,6). After I move to (4,6) without eating, I am at (4,6) with no body, so my tail is not defined? But in the coordinate list, when there is no body, the list has only the head? From the description: \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one, and the last tuple is the tail.\" So if there is no body, the list has only one tuple, the head. So after moving to a new cell without eating, the list still has only one tuple, the new head. So when I eat, I grow, so after moving to the apple, the list now has two tuples: the new head and the previous head? But since I had only one tuple before, after moving to apple, I have two tuples: the new head and the old head? But the old head is the position I moved from? Yes, that makes sense. So if I move from A to B and B has apple, then after move, my snake has head at B and body at A? But since I had no body, the body is just A? But in the list, it would be [B, A]? But the list is head to tail, so head is B, then next is A, which is connected to B, and since there are only two, A is the tail.\n\nSo, after eating, I have two segments: head and tail.\n\nThen, when I move next, I move the head to a new cell, and the tail moves forward? But in snake, when you move, the head moves to a new cell, and if you don't eat, the tail is removed from the end. If you eat, the tail is not removed, so you grow.\n\nBut in this case, after eating, I have head at B and tail at A. When I move, I move head to C, and since I didn't eat, I remove the tail A? So the new list is [C, B]? So the tail moves to B? But since B was the head, it becomes the body? So after eating, when I move without eating, the body shortens? No, in standard snake, when you eat, you grow, so the snake length increases by one. After that, if you don't eat, the length remains the same? Let's clarify.\n\nSuppose snake has length L. When it moves to a new cell without eating, the head moves to new cell, and the tail cell is vacated, so length remains L. When it moves to an apple, the head moves to new cell, and the tail does not move, so length becomes L+1.\n\nIn terms of coordinates: before move, snake has segments S1, S2, ..., SL where S1 is head, SL is tail. After move to a new cell C without eating, new segments are C, S1, S2, ..., S_{L-1}? But that would be L+1 segments, which is wrong. Actually, in the list, after move, the new head is C, and then the old head S1 becomes the first body segment, and so on, but the tail SL is removed. So the new list is [C, S1, S2, ..., S_{L-1}] if L>1, but if L=1, after move without eating, new list is [C] only, so length remains 1.\n\nIf moving to apple without eating? No, if moving to apple, you eat, so you grow. So after moving to apple, the new list is [C, S1, S2, ..., SL]? But that would be L+1 segments. Yes, because you add a segment at the tail? No, actually, when you eat, the tail does not move, so the new list is [C, S1, S2, ..., SL] but since SL was the tail, and you added C, the tail remains SL? But that would be the same segments? I think I have it wrong.\n\nIn standard snake implementation: when you move, you add a new head at the direction moved, and if you ate an apple, you do not remove the tail, so the snake lengthens by one. If you did not eat, you remove the tail.\n\nSo in terms of coordinate list: before move, list = [H, B1, B2, ..., T] where H is head, T is tail. After move to new cell C: if no apple, new list = [C, H, B1, B2, ..., B_{L-2}]? But the tail T is removed, so the new list has L segments? Let's take L=1: list = [H]. After move to C without apple: new list = [C]? So yes, length 1. After move to C with apple: new list = [C, H]? So length 2, with H as tail.\n\nFor L=2: list = [H, T]. After move to C without apple: new list = [C, H]? So tail T is removed, so only two segments: C and H. After move to C with apple: new list = [C, H, T]? But that would be three segments? But since I ate, I should grow, so from length 2 to length 3. Yes, so new list has three segments: head C, then H, then T? But H was the head, now it becomes body, and T remains tail? So yes, the tail doesn't move, so the old tail T is still there? But in the list, after adding C, the old head H becomes the first body, and the old tail T becomes the second body, so the new tail is T? But since the snake is connected, from C to H to T, so T is the tail. So yes, length increases to 3.\n\nSo in general, after moving to an apple, the new list is [C] + old list, so the old list is appended after the new head, so the tail remains the same? No, the old list includes the head and body, so after adding new head, the entire old list becomes the body, so the tail is the same as before? In the example, for L=2, old list [H,T], after move to C with apple, new list [C,H,T], so tail is T, which was the old tail. So the tail doesn't change? But in terms of position, the tail T remains at the same cell? But when the snake moves, the tail should move if no eat, but when eat, the tail doesn't move. So in this case, after eating, the tail remains at the same cell? But in the new list, the tail is still T, so yes, it doesn't move.\n\nBut when the snake moves without eating, the tail moves? For example, from [H,T] move to C without eat, new list [C,H], so tail is now H, which was the old head, so the tail moved from T to H? So the tail does move forward when no eat.\n\nBack to my case: I have no body, so list = [ (5,6) ]. If I move to an apple, say I move to (2,6) and eat, then after move, list = [ (2,6), (5,6) ]? But that would mean head at (2,6) and tail at (5,6), but the distance between them is 3 steps, which is fine, but the body would be the path from (2,6) to (5,6)? But in the list, only two points, so the body is straight? Actually, in snake, the body segments are connected, so from (2,6) to (5,6) should be a straight line, but since I moved step by step, the body should be at (3,6) and (4,6)? But in the list, when I move directly from (5,6) to (4,6) to (3,6) to (2,6), if I eat at (2,6), then after eating, the list should include all previous positions? But from the move sequence, after first move to (4,6), no eat, so list = [ (4,6) ]. After second move to (3,6), no eat, list = [ (3,6) ]. After third move to (2,6), with eat, list = [ (2,6), (3,6) ]? So the body is only at (3,6), and the tail is at (3,6)? But then the snake has only two segments: head at (2,6) and body/tail at (3,6)? But what about (4,6) and (5,6)? Since I moved without eating, those cells are vacated, so the snake only has two segments after eating? That seems correct because I moved three times, but only after the last move I ate, so I grew by one segment, so from length 1 to length 2. So after three moves, I have two segments: head at (2,6) and tail at (3,6). The cells (4,6) and (5,6) are empty.\n\nSo in terms of path, when I move from (5,6) to (4,6) to (3,6) to (2,6), and eat at (2,6), then after the eat, my body is only at (3,6), and head at (2,6). So the body is just the previous cell.\n\nSo for strategy, when I go for an apple, I need to ensure that after eating, I don't have a long body that might trap me, but since I have only one body segment after first apple, it should be fine.\n\nNow, back to the decision.\n\nI think moving LEFT is a good move because it gets me closer to apple at (2,6) quickly, and it seems safe.\n\nSimilarly, moving DOWN is also good, but takes longer to get an apple.\n\nBut let's see if there are any apples closer? From (5,6), the apple at (2,6) is 3 steps away, and at (8,5) is 4 steps away? Manhattan distance: to (2,6) is 3, to (8,5) is 4, so (2,6) is closer.\n\nAlso, from the board, at (2,6) there is an apple, and at (8,5) there is an apple, but also at (7,1), etc., but (2,6) is the closest.\n\nSo I should go for (2,6).\n\nTherefore, I should move LEFT.\n\nBut is there any risk in moving LEFT? From (5,6) to (4,6), then to (3,6), then to (2,6). During these moves, the enemy is at (6,3), so no interaction. Also, after eating, I have body at (3,6), and head at (2,6). Then I need to move away, but since I have only one body segment, I can move easily. For example, I can move LEFT to (1,6) or RIGHT to (3,6) but that would be into my body? Moving RIGHT from (2,6) to (3,6) would be into my own body, which kills me, so I should not do that. So after eating, I need to move away from my body. So I can move LEFT to (1,6) or DOWN to (2,5) or UP to (2,7), etc.\n\nBut that is future concern.\n\nFor now, moving LEFT seems safe and beneficial.\n\nNow, what about moving RIGHT? I considered the risk of collision with enemy if we both move towards each other. But since enemy might not move towards me, it might be safe, but why take the risk when there is a safer move with better apple access?\n\nSimilarly, moving DOWN might be safe, but it takes longer to get an apple.\n\nSo, I think LEFT is the best move.\n\nBut let's confirm if there are any other apples at (2,6) or nearby? From the board, only one apple at (2,6).\n\nAlso, after I eat, a new apple might appear, but I don't know where.\n\nSo, for now, I'll go with LEFT.\n\nTherefore, my move is LEFT.\n\nBut before finalizing, let's list all moves and eliminate any that are unsafe.\n\n- UP: to (5,7). Safe? Board yes, no snakes, no self body. So safe.\n\n- DOWN: to (5,5). Safe.\n\n- LEFT: to (4,6). Safe.\n\n- RIGHT: to (6,6). Safe? But from earlier, there is a risk of collision with enemy if enemy moves appropriately, but immediately, it is safe. However, since we are to avoid likely head-on collisions, and moving RIGHT towards the enemy might increase risk, so perhaps not preferred.\n\nBut in this case, since the enemy is at (6,3), and I move to (6,6), it might be ok, but let's see if there is any apple in that direction? From (6,6), I can go to (8,5) which is apple, but it takes multiple moves. Also, from (6,6), I might encounter the enemy if it moves up.\n\nBut compared to LEFT, which has a clear path to an apple and less risk of collision.\n\nSo, I think LEFT is better.\n\nThus, I choose LEFT.\n\nSo, the final answer should beBased on the current board state, my snake is at (5,6) with no body, and I need to choose a move that ensures survival while positioning myself for apple collection. The apples are at (7,1), (8,5), (8,0), (1,0), and (2,6). From my position, the apple at (2,6) is the closest with a Manhattan distance of 3, and the path to it is clear\u2014moving left to (4,6) is safe and reduces the distance to this apple. The enemy snake at (6,3) is distant and unlikely to collide immediately, especially since moving left avoids potential head-on collisions that could occur if I moved right toward the enemy's general direction. Additionally, moving up or down would increase the distance to apples or offer no significant benefit. Therefore, moving left is the safest and most efficient choice to collect an apple quickly.\n\nLEFT",

In Snake logic, if a snake is on an apple, it is about to eat it, but for collision purposes, the snake occupies the cell. If Snake #1 eats the apple at (8, 0), they will grow and their tail (at 7, 1) will remain for this turn (since heads move first). If they die or move off, the apple remains until eaten.\n*   **Immediate Goal:** Reach the apple at (1, 0) or (2, 1).\n\n**Evaluating Moves:**\n\n1.  **DOWN (to 1, 4):** Valid coordinate. Board shows `.` at (1, 4). This is safe and moves closer to the apples at (1, 0) and (2, 1).\n2.  **UP (to 1, 6):** Valid coordinate. Board shows `T` at (1, 6). This is my previous head position. Since my body is growing (I ate last turn), my tail will *not* move forward immediately. The cell (1, 6) will remain occupied by my body. **Collision.**\n3.  **LEFT (to 0, 5):** Valid coordinate. Board shows `.` at (0, 5). Safe, but moves left away from the apple cluster at (1, 0) and (2, 1).\n4.  **RIGHT (to 2, 5):** Valid coordinate. Board shows `.` at (2, 5). Safe. This moves horizontally towards the apple at (2, 1) or (3, 5).\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\n\nI am at (1, 5). The most direct path to the apple at (1, 0) is straight down. The apple at (2, 1) is also a target, but requires a turn to the right at some point.\nSnake #1 is at (8, 0) and likely to eat the apple there. They are far away and unlikely to intercept my path down the x=1 column.\n\nComparing **DOWN** and **RIGHT**:\n*   **DOWN** makes progress toward (1, 0) and keeps the option to go RIGHT later (via 1,4 -> 2,4... or 1,4 -> 2,4 -> 2,3 etc) to target (2, 1).\n*   **RIGHT** goes to (2, 5). From there, I can go DOWN to (2, 4), etc. This is also a valid path.\n\nHowever, the prompt states: *\"Prefer moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available.\"*\nFrom (1, 4) (Down), I can go Down, Left, or Right. From (2, 5) (Right), I can go Up, Down, or Right (Left is blocked by my body at 1,5? No, I am at 1,5. Wait, if I move Right to 2,5, my head is at 2,5. My body is at 1,5 and 1,6 and 2,6.

So (1,4) offers slightly more directional variety.\n\nAlso, the apple at (1, 0) is closer if I go DOWN.\nI will continue the descent towards (1, 0).\n\n**Plan:** Continue DOWN to (1, 4).

Total length: 3.\n*   **Apple Locations:** (8, 5), (1, 0), (3, 5), (2, 1), (4, 7).\n*   **Board Context:** I am at (1, 4). The apple at (1, 0) is directly below me. My tail is at (1, 5), blocking the UP move. The cell immediately below me (1, 3) is empty. The cell to my right (2, 4) is empty. The cell to my left (0, 4) is empty.\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (1, 4):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 1, 5):** This moves back into my own body (specifically my tail). Since I did not eat last turn (or if I did, the rules state moving into where your tail *was* is fatal unless it moves away). In this strict environment, moving into a cell occupied by your body is death. **Unsafe.**\n2.  **LEFT (to 0, 4):** Valid coordinate. Board shows `.`. Safe. However, this moves away from the apple at (1, 0) and doesn't open up immediate high-value paths. It keeps me at the edge.\n3.  **RIGHT (to 2, 4):** Valid coordinate. Board shows `.`. Safe. This moves horizontally. From here, I could go DOWN to (2, 3) or other directions. It keeps options open.\n4.  **DOWN (to 1, 3):** Valid coordinate. Board shows `.`. Safe. This moves directly toward the apple at (1, 0). This is the most direct path to scoring.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nMy primary goal is to collect apples. The apple at (1, 0) is reachable in 3 turns via the path (1, 4) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0).\nEnemy Snake #1 is far away at (7, 0) and poses no immediate threat to this column.\nMoving DOWN maintains the straight-line path to the apple, which is usually the safest and fastest route in a 10x10 grid when the path is open.\n\n**Plan:** Continue descending down the x=1 column towards the apple at (1, 0). Monitor enemy movements. If the path becomes blocked, pivot to the right (towards (2, 1) or (3, 5)).\n\nDOWN",

This cell contains an apple 'A'. To my South (1, 0) is another apple. To my North (1, 2) is my own body (tail). To my West (0, 1) is a wall (implied edge, checking bounds... 0 is valid, board shows '.' there, but (0,1) is open). To my East (2, 1) is an apple 'A'.\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (1, 1):**\n\n1.  **UP (to 1, 2):** Invalid. This moves directly into my own body at (1, 2). I would die.\n2.  **DOWN (to 1, 0):** Valid. This moves to an apple at (1, 0). Safe. Moves toward the bottom edge, which is a dead end if I stay there too long, but immediate survival and growth are priorities.\n3.  **LEFT (to 0, 1):** Valid. Board shows '.'. Safe. Moves to the edge of the board (x=0).\n4.  **RIGHT (to 2, 1):** Valid. This moves to an apple at (2, 1). Safe.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nI have three safe moves, all of which land on apples: DOWN to (1, 0), RIGHT to (2, 1), or potentially collecting the one I'm standing on if the move consumes it (usually the move takes you *to* the cell, then you eat).\n\nLet's look at the board state relative to the apples:\n- Current: (1, 1) - Apple.\n- South: (1, 0) - Apple.\n- East: (2, 1) - Apple.\n- Future targets: (3, 5) and (4, 7) are far.\n\n**Immediate Survival & Growth:**\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 0), I eat the apple there. My tail becomes (1, 1).\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 1), I eat the apple there. My tail becomes (1, 1).\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 1), I do not eat an apple (board shows '.'). This is worse than eating.\n\n**Long-term planning:**\nThe apple at (1, 0) is on the bottom edge (y=0). Moving there creates a \"corner\" risk. If I go to (1, 0), I can only go UP (back to 1,1), LEFT (to 0,0), or RIGHT (to 2,0). (0,0) and (2,0) are empty.\nThe apple at (2, 1) is more central. From (2, 1), I can access (3, 5) eventually or cluster around (1,0) and (2,1).\n\nHowever, looking at the board, the apple at (1, 0) is isolated. The apples at (1,0), (2,1), and (1,1) form a cluster.\nLet's look at the enemy. Enemy is at (7,3). They are far away.\n\nDecision: I am currently on an apple. The prompt implies the move takes me to the target. If I stay put (not possible) or move, I leave the apple at (1,1).\nI need to pick a direction.\nDOWN to (1,0) collects an apple.\nRIGHT to (2,1) collects an apple.\n\nLet's check the board layout again.\nRow 1: `. 0 A . . . . T . .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nMy head is at 1,1.\nMy tail is at 1,2.\nApple at 2,1.\nApple at 1,0.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1):\n- I eat the apple.\n- My tail moves to (1,1).\n- New head is (2,1).\n- From (2,1), I can go UP to (2,2), DOWN to (2,0), or LEFT to (1,1) (which will be empty when I leave it, unless my tail is there? No, tail follows).\n- This seems open.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1,0):\n- I eat the apple.\n- My tail moves to (1,1).\n- New head is (1,0).\n- From (1,0), I can only go UP (back to 1,1, where tail will be?), LEFT (0,0), or RIGHT (2,0).\n- (0,0) is empty.\n- (2,0) is empty.\n- This is a potential trap if the tail blocks the exit.\n\nLet's check the \"danger\" of moving DOWN.\nIf I move DOWN to (1,0):\n- My new tail is at (1,1).\n- Next turn, from (1,0), I can go LEFT to (0,0) or RIGHT to (2,0) to loop around.\n- I must avoid hitting my tail at (1,1).\n- This is doable.\n\nLet's check moving RIGHT to (2,1):\n- My new tail is at (1,1).\n- From (2,1), I can go UP to (2,2), DOWN to (2,0), or LEFT to (1,1).\n- (1,1) will be my tail.\n- (2,0) is empty. (2,2) is empty.\n- This seems more flexible.\n\nHowever, I want to maximize apple collection.\nI can't eat both (1,0) and (2,1) in one turn.\nIs there a way to eat one, then the other?\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1):\n- Eat apple.\n- Tail at (1,1).\n- Next turn I can go DOWN to (2,0). (2,0) is empty.\n- Then LEFT to (1,0). (1,0) is apple.\n- Then I have to move out of (1,0).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1,0):\n- Eat apple.\n- Tail at (1,1).\n- Next turn I can go RIGHT to (2,0). (2,0) is empty.\n- Then UP to (2,1). (2,1) is empty (I ate it this turn... wait, no, if I go DOWN this turn, I don't eat (2,1)).\n- So if I go DOWN now, (2,1) remains an apple for next turn.\n- Then I go RIGHT to (2,0), then UP to (2,1) to eat that apple.\n- This sequence seems valid and collects both apples.\n\nLet's double check coordinates.\nTurn 9:\nOption A: DOWN to (1,0). Eat apple. Tail moves to (1,1).\nTurn 10:\nFrom (1,0). Options: UP (blocked by tail at 1,1?), LEFT (0,0), RIGHT (2,0).\nTail is at (1,1). So UP is blocked.\nI must go LEFT or RIGHT.\nRIGHT to (2,0).\nTurn 11:\nFrom (2,0). Options: UP (2,1), LEFT (1,0), DOWN (2,-1 invalid), RIGHT (3,0).\n(2,1) is the apple.\nI go UP to (2,1). Eat apple. Tail moves to (2,0).\nTurn 12:\nFrom (2,1). Options: UP (2,2), DOWN (2,0 - blocked by tail), LEFT (1,1), RIGHT (3,1).\nI have plenty of space.\n\nOption B: RIGHT to (2,1). Eat apple. Tail moves to (1,1).\nTurn 10:\nFrom (2,1). Options: UP (2,2), DOWN (2,0), LEFT (1,1 - blocked by tail), RIGHT (3,1).\nI can go DOWN to (2,0).\nTurn 11:\nFrom (2,0). Options: UP (2,1), LEFT (1,0), DOWN invalid, RIGHT (3,0).\n(1,0) is apple. I can go LEFT to (1,0). Eat apple. Tail moves to (2,0).\nTurn 12:\nFrom (1,0). Options: UP (1,1), LEFT (0,0), RIGHT (2,0 - blocked by tail).\nI can go UP or LEFT.\n\nBoth sequences work.\nHowever, moving DOWN now puts me at (1,0) which is a \"corner\" relative to the board edges (bottom row). If I get trapped there, I die. Moving RIGHT puts me at (2,1), which is more central.\nBut the prompt asks to \"prefer moves that ... keep future options open\".\nAt (1,0), I have 2 exit options (LEFT, RIGHT) plus the tail block.\nAt (2,1), I have 3 exit options (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) plus the tail block.\n(2,1) is strictly better for future options.\n\nAlso, looking at the \"Last Rationale\", I was at (1,2) and moved DOWN to (1,1) to eat the apple there.\nNow I am at (1,1).\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,1), I eat the apple there.\nIf I move DOWN to (1,0), I eat the apple there.\nThe enemy snake is far away.\nThe apples at (3,5) and (4,7) are the next targets.\n(2,1) is closer to the center/right side than (1,0).\n\nLet's assume the \"safe\" move is the one that keeps me away from edges.\nRIGHT to (2,1) moves me right (increasing x).\nDOWN to (1,0) moves me down (decreasing y) to the edge.\n\nI will choose RIGHT to (2,1).\nWhy?\n1. It eats an apple.\n2. It keeps me off the bottom edge (y=0).\n3. From (2,1), I have better access to the rest of the board (x > 1) and can move towards (3,5).\n\nWait, I need to check if (2,1) is blocked by the enemy.\nEnemy is at (7,3). No.\nIs there any other snake? No.\n\nLet's re-read the rules about head-on collisions.\n\"Head-on collision\" = both heads move into same cell.\nI am moving to (2,1).\nIf the enemy moves to (2,1), we both die.\nEnemy is at (7,3). To get to (2,1), they would need to move LEFT 5 and DOWN 2.\nUnlikely.\n\nOkay, plan is RIGHT.\n\n**Plan:** Move RIGHT to (2,1) to eat the apple there. This maintains a central position relative to the board edges compared to (1,0). From (2,1), I will look to clear the remaining apples in the vicinity (1,0) and then turn North towards (3,5).\n**END RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

The apple at (1, 0) is directly to my left. Moving **LEFT** will allow me to consume the apple, increasing my score to 3. This aligns perfectly with the long-term plan established in the previous turn (down to (2,0), left to (1,0)).\n\nI must ensure that eating this apple doesn't trap me or kill me.\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 0) and eat the apple:\n1.  I grow. The new body will be [(1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)].\n2.  The tail will be (1,2).\n3.

Let's trace that carefully.\nCurrent State:\n*   Head: (2,0)\n*   Body: [(2,1), (1,1), (1,2)]\n*   Tail: (1,2)\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (1,0):\n*   New Head: (1,0)\n*   New Body: [(1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (1,1), (1,2)]\n*   The cell (1,2) will become empty (tail moved).\n*   The cell (1,1) becomes part of the body.\n*   The cell (2,0) becomes body.\n*   The cell (2,1) becomes body.\n\nFrom (1,0) next turn:\n*   Up: (1,1) -> Currently (1,1) in *current* state. In *next* state, (1,1) is body. So UP is blocked.\n*   Left: (0,0) -> Currently empty. In *next* state, still empty (unless I eat something). Safe.\n*   Right: (2,0) -> Currently head. In *next* state, it's body (the segment behind me). Blocked.\n*   Down: Off board. Blocked.\n\nThis is a \"canyon\" situation. After eating (1,0), I will be trapped on the bottom row with only one exit: Left to (0,0). From (0,0), I will be forced to go Up to (0,1), then Up to (0,2), etc. This is a valid survival path, but it's restrictive.\n\n**Is there a better move?**\n*   If I move **RIGHT** to (3,0): I preserve my bottom-row options and continue towards the center apples ((3,5), etc.). However, I leave the apple at (1,0) behind. (1,0) is on the edge; if I don't take it now, I might have to loop back a long way to get it later. Given the snake density is low, securing points is usually better than exploring blindly.\n*   If I move **UP**: Dead.\n*   If I move **DOWN**: Dead.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **LEFT** to (1,0) is the only available move that doesn't result in an immediate death (other than RIGHT, which is a valid alternative but misses the apple). Since the prompt asks to \"prefer moves that both increase your chance of safely eating apples,\" taking the guaranteed apple at (1,0) is the mathematically correct choice. The restriction it places on my next turn (forcing me to go Left to 0,0) is manageable.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (1,0) to eat the apple. Accept that the subsequent move will likely be LEFT to (0,0) to escape the trap caused by my own tail. Then maneuver Up along the left wall to re-enter the board center.\nLEFT\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

This means Snake #0 will definitely move to (0, 1) this turn.\n\n### Apple Priority Analysis\nFrom my current position at (9, 5):\n- (6, 9): 4 units away (LEFT 3, UP 4)\n- (4, 7): 5 units away (LEFT 5, UP 2)\n- (3, 5): 6 units away (LEFT 6)\n- (1, 9): 9 units away (LEFT 8, UP 4)\n\n### Analysis of Each Safe Move\n\n**UP to (9, 6)**:\n- Moves me up the board\n- Gets me closer to the apple at (6, 9)\n- Keeps me mobile and away from the bottom edge\n- From (9, 6), I can move left and up to reach (6, 9)\n\n**DOWN to (9, 4)**:\n- Moves me down the board\n- Gets me closer to the bottom edge (not ideal)\n- Does not get me closer to any apples\n- Less strategic value than UP\n\n### Analysis of Enemy Snake Movement\nSnake #0 will definitely move UP to (0, 1) this turn. This means:\n- Snake #0 cannot interfere with my path to any of the apples\n- Snake #0 will be at (0, 1) after this move, with body at (0, 0), (1, 0), and (2, 0)\n- No conflict with my moves\n\n### Decision\n\nI will choose **UP** to (9, 6). This will:\n1. Move me up the board and closer to the apple at (6, 9)\n2. Keep me mobile and away from the edges\n3. Position me to potentially get the apple at (6, 9) in future turns\n4. No conflict with Snake #0\n\n### Plan for the next few turns:\n1. Move UP to (9, 6) to get closer to the apple at (6, 9)\n2. From (9, 6), continue moving LEFT to (8, 6), then LEFT to (7, 6), then LEFT to (6, 6)\n3. From (6, 6), move UP to (6, 7), then UP to (6, 8), then UP to (6, 9) to eat the apple\n4. Keep monitoring Snake #0's position - it's currently at (0, 0) and will move to (0, 1) this turn\n5. I now have 5 points vs Snake #0's 3 points, so I have a 2-point lead\n\nUP",

While moving UP was necessary to survive the previous turn, continuing to hug the left wall (moving UP again) restricts my movement and risks trapping me in a corner later. Moving RIGHT takes me away from the wall and into the central area of the board, significantly increasing my maneuverability. The central area contains apples (e.g., (1,6), (3,5)). Moving RIGHT sets a trajectory towards these apples and avoids the potential \"vertical snake\" trap against the wall.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove **RIGHT** to (1, 1). This move is safe immediately and provides the most future flexibility (3 open exits next turn vs 2 if I go UP).\n\nRIGHT",

Moving RIGHT puts me directly on the path to (3, 5) (x=3). Moving UP directs me towards (1, 6) (y=6).\nAdditionally, looking at the board, my current body spans from (0,0) to (1,0) horizontally. Moving UP at (1,1) creates a vertical segment at (1,1) and (1,0) which is structurally sound. Moving RIGHT puts a horizontal segment at (2,1) and (1,1). Both are viable. However, checking the space around the target (3,5): it is open.\nA key consideration is avoiding the left wall. While UP keeps me close to the left wall, RIGHT moves me away, increasing general board safety.\nHowever, moving UP towards (1,6) is also very direct.\nLet's look at the enemy snake. They are far away.\nLet's check coordinates again. (3,5) is an apple. To get there from (1,1), I need +2 X, +4 Y.\nIf I move RIGHT now, I am at (2,1). Next turn I can move UP to (2,2). This seems efficient.\nIf I move UP now, I am at (1,2). Next turn I can move RIGHT to (2,2).\nBoth converge on (2,2). So the immediate direction doesn't lock me out of the apple.\nHowever, the prompt history says I moved RIGHT last turn to get to (1,1). Continuing RIGHT towards the center is generally safer than hugging the left wall.\nWait, let's look at the board carefully.\nRow 5 has an apple at (3,5).\nRow 6 has an apple at (1,6) and the enemy snake at (8,6).\nRow 9 has apples at (6,9) and (1,9).\nMy current position is (1,1). The apple at (1,6) is straight up. That's 5 moves away.\nThe apple at (3,5) is 2 right, 4 up. That's 6 moves away.\n(1,6) is closer.\nSo moving UP prioritizes the closer apple.\nWhy did I move RIGHT to (1,1)? The rationale said \"Moving RIGHT takes me away from the wall\". But now at (1,1), I am one step away from the wall. Moving UP takes me to (1,2) - still on the wall column. Moving RIGHT takes me to (2,1) - off the wall.\nActually, moving UP to (1,2) leaves me vulnerable to being trapped against the wall later if I don't turn right soon.\nMoving RIGHT to (2,1) opens up the board.\nBut let's look at the apple at (1,6). It's directly north. If I go RIGHT now, I have to curve back left later to get to (1,6).\nIf I go UP now, I am on the track for (1,6).\nLet's check safety of the path.\nPath UP: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). This path is alongside the wall.\nPath RIGHT: (2,1), (2,2)... then UP.\nMoving UP seems to be the more direct path to an apple.\nHowever, the previous rationale emphasized avoiding the \"vertical snake\" trap against the wall.\nIf I go UP to (1,2), I am forming a vertical column.\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 1: `T 0 . . .`\nMy head is at 1,1. My tail is at 1,0.\nIf I go UP, I am at 1,2.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at 2,1.\nLet's look at the enemy snake. Head (8,6). Body (9,6)... (7,5). They are moving left? No, they just moved into (8,6). The tail is at (7,5). So the body is (9,6)->(9,5)->(8,5)->(7,5). Wait, the board shows row 5 has T T T at 7,8,9? No, the board shows `5 . . . A . . . T T T`. This means (7,5), (8,5), (9,5) are the tail end?\nLet's re-read the enemy body: `[(9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]`.\nSo (9,6) is head? No, `Head: (8, 6)`. The prompt says \"Head: (8, 6), Body: [(9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]\".\nWait, usually the body list *includes* the tail. If the head is (8,6), the body list usually starts with the segment behind the head.\nIf Head is (8,6), and Body is [(9,6), ...], that implies (9,6) is the segment behind (8,6). So the snake is moving? (8,6) -> (9,6)? That's moving Right.\nOr is the body list ordered from head to tail?\n\"Coordinate reminder: decreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\"\n\"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one, and the last tuple is the tail.\"\nWait, for the enemy snake it says: \"Snake #1 - Head: (8, 6), Body: [(9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]\".\nThis is slightly contradictory. \"Head: (8, 6)\" sets the head. \"Body: [(9, 6), ...]\" would usually be the rest of the snake.\nIf the head is (8,6), and the next segment is (9,6), that is a movement to the Right.\nIf the head is (8,6), and the next segment is (7,6), that is Left.\nHere, the body list starts with (9,6). So the order is (8,6) -> (9,6) -> (9,5) -> ...\nSo the snake is positioned vertically? No, (8,6) and (9,6) are adjacent horizontally.\nSo the snake body is: H(8,6), S1(9,6), S2(9,5), S3(8,5), Tail(7,5).\nThis snake is \"bent\".\nThe board shows `6 . A . . . . . . 1 T`.\nAt (8,6) is the head (Snake #1).\nAt (9,6) is the first body segment (Snake #1).\nAt (9,5) is the second body segment.\nSo the board representation `1 T` at (8,6) and (9,6) is correct?\nRow 6: `6 . A . . . . . . 1 T`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nSo index 8 has '1' (Head), index 9 has 'T' (Body?).\nWait, the prompt says \"Body: [(9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]\".\nIf (9,6) is the first body part, it should be 'T' (Tail?) or '0' (Body). 'T' usually means Tail.\nIf (9,6) is the Tail, then the body list should end with it.\n\"Body: [(9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]\".\nIf (9,6) is the tail, then the snake is (7,5) -> (8,5) -> (9,5) -> (9,6).\nThis matches the board: (7,5) T, (8,5) T, (9,5) T, (9,6) T? No, board says (9,6) T.\nWait, let's look at the board for row 5: `5 . . . A . . . T T T`.\nIndices 7, 8, 9 are T. (7,5), (8,5), (9,5).\nRow 6: `6 . A . . . . . . 1 T`.\nIndices 8, 9 are (8,6) Head, (9,6) T.\nSo the snake body parts are at (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6).\nThe head is at (8,6).\nSo the snake looks like:\n(8,6) Head\n(9,6) Body\n(9,5) Body\n(8,5) Body\n(7,5) Tail.\nThis matches the provided list \"Body: [(9, 6), (9, 5), (8, 5), (7, 5)]\".\nSo the snake is turning. It just moved into (8,6) (Head). Where did it come from?\nFrom (8,6), possible previous positions were (7,6), (9,6), (8,7), (8,5).\n(8,5) is occupied by body.\n(9,6) is occupied by body.\n(7,6) is empty on board.\n(8,7) is empty on board.\nIt's hard to guess intent. But they are far away.\n\n**Decision:**\nI am at (1,1).\nMy history says I moved RIGHT to get here.\nThe apple at (1,6) is close.\nIf I move UP to (1,2), I am on the path to (1,6).\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,1), I am on the path to (3,5) or (1,6) with a bend.\nLet's check the safety of the \"UP\" path again.\n(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6).\nRow 1 is currently `T 0 . . .`\nRow 2 is empty.\nRow 3 is empty.\nRow 4 is empty.\nRow 5 has an apple at (3,5). (1,5) is empty.\nRow 6 has an apple at (1,6).\nSo the path UP is clear of obstacles except the wall at the top.\nHowever, if I go UP, I am stuck on the wall. If another snake appears or I turn, I might trap myself.\nBut the prompt specifically warned about \"vertical corridor\" trap in the rationale, but it was talking about moving UP when at (0,1). Now I am at (1,1).\nMoving UP to (1,2) puts me one unit off the wall (x=1).\nIf I go UP to (1,2), then UP to (1,3)... I am still on column 1.\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,1), I am on column 2.\nI want to get the apple at (1,6).\nGoing UP is the most direct route.\nWhy did I hesitate? Because the previous turn's rationale said \"Moving RIGHT takes me away from the wall\".\nBut now I am at (1,1). The wall is at x=0.\nGoing UP keeps me at x=1.\nGoing RIGHT moves me to x=2.\nThe apple at (1,6) is at x=1.\nTo get the (1,6) apple, I have to be at x=1 eventually.\nIf I go RIGHT now, I have to come back LEFT to (1,6). Coming back LEFT means I would be moving into my own body unless I have grown enough to clear the path.\nExample: I go (2,1) -> (2,2). My body follows: (1,1) -> (0,1) -> (0,0) -> (1,0).\nNow I am at (2,2). Can I go LEFT to (1,2)? Yes.\nThen (1,2). Body: (2,2), (1,1), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0).\nThen (1,3)... etc.\nSo I can snake my way.\nBut if I go UP now: (1,2).\nBody: (1,1), (0,1), (0,0), (1,0).\nI am on the path.\nLet's look at the board again.\nThere is an apple at (3,5). If I go UP, I pass x=1. If I go RIGHT, I pass x=2,3.\n(3,5) is closer to RIGHT path than UP path (which is at x=1).\nDistance from (1,1) to (3,5): 2 right, 4 up = 6 steps.\nDistance from (1,1) to (1,6): 0 right, 5 up = 5 steps.\nSo (1,6) is closer.\nIf I go UP, I can get (1,6) in 5 turns.\nIf I go RIGHT, I can get (3,5) in 6 turns, or (1,6) in 6 turns (1 right, 4 up, 1 left? No, that's not how snake works).\nActually, if I go RIGHT, I change my orientation.\nLet's stick to the simplest path. The UP path is clear and leads to an apple.\nThe previous rationale's warning was about \"hugging the left wall\". I am at (1,1). x=1 is not the wall (x=0 is).\nSo moving UP is not hugging the wall.\nTherefore, UP seems safe and efficient.\nIs there any trap?\nIf I go UP to (1,2).\nNext turn options: UP (1,3), DOWN (1,1 - body), LEFT (0,1 - body), RIGHT (2,1 - empty).\nSo 2 options: UP or RIGHT.\nIf I go UP to (1,3).\nNext turn options: UP (1,4), DOWN (1,2 - body), LEFT (0,3), RIGHT (2,3).\nStill safe.\nThe only risk is if the enemy snake moves to cut me off.\nEnemy is at (8,6). It would take them a long time to reach me.\nSo, I will move UP.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move UP towards the apple at (1,6). Monitor the board for any threats that might block this path, in which case I will turn RIGHT to navigate around.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

It moves me closer to the apple cluster on the left side (4, 7), (3, 5), and (1, 9)\n2. It maintains good mobility for both UP and DOWN movements\n3. It avoids moving directly toward the enemy snake which is on the left side but at a lower y-coordinate\n4.

Body: `[(1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2)]`.\n*   **Apple Consumption:** I am currently at (1, 6). Looking at the board state provided, there is an 'A' at (1, 6). However, the prompt states \"Apples at: (3, 5), (4, 7), (1, 9), (6, 5), (7, 5)\". The apple at (1, 6) is not listed in the inventory. I must assume the board depiction is slightly visual (perhaps showing where I *just* moved) but the list of apples is the absolute truth for available targets. Therefore, I did *not* eat an apple on the previous turn. I am still at size 5 (4 apples collected).\n*   **Target Apples:**\n    *   (1, 9): Distance 3. Path: (1,7), (1,8), (1,9).\n    *   (3, 5): Distance 3. Path: (2,6), (3,6), (3,5).\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head: (6, 9). Body: `[(6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6)]`.\n    *   **Threat Analysis:** Enemy is at (6, 9). They are adjacent to apple at (6, 5) (down 4, blocked by their body), (7, 5) (left/down diagonal), and (4, 7) (left 2). Their most likely moves are to grab nearby food.\n    *   **Critical Threat:** If Enemy moves to (5, 9) or (6, 8) (retrace), they might expand. If they move to (5, 9), they are closer to the top edge. If they move to (6, 8), they are moving down, perhaps towards (4, 7).\n    *   **Head-on Collision:** My head is at (1, 6). Enemy head is at (6, 9). Distance is large. No immediate collision.\n\n**Adjacency Check from (1, 6):**\n\n*   **UP (1, 7):** Empty. Leads to (1, 8), (1, 9) (Apple). **SAFE.**\n*   **DOWN (1, 5):** Occupied by my own body. **KILL.**\n*   **RIGHT (2, 6):** Empty. Leads to (3, 6), (3, 5) (Apple). **SAFE.**\n*   **LEFT (0, 6):** Empty. Leads to dead end (0, 6) -> (0, 7) -> (0, 8). **LOW VALUE.**\n\n**Strategic Plan:**\nI am at a fork. I can go UP towards (1, 9) or RIGHT towards (3, 5).\n*   **Option UP (1, 7):** Moves me vertically. Path is clear. (1, 9) is reachable. However, the area above (y>9) is wall.\n*   **Option RIGHT (2, 6):** Moves me horizontally. Path to (3, 5) is clear. From there, I can access (4, 7) and (6, 5) clusters.\n*   **Decision:** Moving **UP** puts me on a direct track for (1, 9). Moving **RIGHT** opens up the central region.\n    *   Checking safety: If I go UP, I secure (1, 9). If I go RIGHT, I might compete for (3, 5).\n    *   Enemy is at (6, 9). They are far.\n    *   Let's look at the board state provided: `(3, 5)` and `(4, 7)` and `(1, 9)` are available.\n    *   If I go RIGHT, I head towards (3, 5). If I go UP, I head towards (1, 9).\n    *   Let's prioritize the path that keeps the most options open. Moving RIGHT towards the center is usually better, but UP is a straight line.\n    *   However, looking at the board, (1, 9) is a corner apple. If I don't take it, it might be hard to get later. (3, 5) is in the open.\n    *   Let's check the specific board state for safety: `(1, 7)` is empty. `(2, 6)` is empty.\n    *   Let's look at the enemy again. They are at (6,9). If they move down, they hit their body (at 6,8). If they move left to (5,9), they are safe. If they move right to (7,9), safe.\n    *   The biggest risk in Snake games is getting trapped. Going UP into the top row (y=9) limits moves (no Up allowed after that). Going RIGHT into the center keeps options open.\n    *   Let's go **UP** to (1, 7). This commits to the (1,9) apple.\n    *   Wait, let's double check the board state relative to the apple list.\n    *   Apples: `(3, 5), (4, 7), (1, 9), (6, 5), (7, 5)`.\n    *   My location: `(1, 6)`.\n    *   Move UP to `(1, 7)`. This is clear.\n    *   Move RIGHT to `(2, 6)`. This is clear.\n    *   The enemy is at `(6, 9)`. The closest apple to them is `(1, 9)`? No, `(1, 9)` is far. Their closest is `(6, 5)` but blocked by body. `(7, 5)` is open. `(4, 7)` is open.\n    *   I will move **UP**. This gets me closer to (1, 9) which is a high-value target (corner).\n\n**Decision:**\nMove UP to (1, 7) to approach the apple at (1, 9).\n\nUP",

If it moves UP to (1, 9), it's going for the apple at (1, 9).

It moves me directly toward the closest apple at (4, 7) - only 1 unit away from the new position\n2. This is the fastest path to eat an apple and maintain my lead\n3. It keeps me in a good position to potentially get to multiple other apples\n4. The path is clear and doesn't risk immediate collision with the enemy\n5. From (4, 8), I can easily move DOWN to (4, 7) on the next turn to collect the apple\n\nDOWN",

Length: 6. Apples: 5.\n    *   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (4, 8). Body: [(4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 7)]. Length: 6. Apples: 5.\n\n2.  **Board State & Threats:**\n    *   **My Position:** I am at the top left corner (1, 9).\n    *   **Enemy Position:** Enemy is at (4, 8) and occupies (4, 9). Their head has moved **DOWN** from (4, 9) to (4, 8) (based on the \"last move UP\" report from the previous turn, which must have been from (4, 8) to (4, 9)).\n    *   **Immediate Threat:** The enemy snake is currently occupying the cell directly above me at (1, 9). Wait, the board shows 'T' at (1, 9) in the top row (row 9). Let's check the board string again:\n        `9 . 0 . . T T T . . .`\n        `8 . T . . 1 . T . . .`\n        At (1, 9), the board shows `0` (my head). At (1, 8), it shows `T` (my body).\n        At (4, 9), the board shows `T` (Enemy tail from previous turn?). At (4, 8), the board shows `1` (Enemy head).\n        *Correction on Enemy Move:* The Enemy was at (4, 9) last turn. The prompt says \"My last move information: UP\". This was *my* move. The Enemy moved simultaneously. The \"Board State\" shows Enemy at (4, 8) now. So the Enemy moved **DOWN** from (4, 9) to (4, 8).\n        *Wait*, the \"Board State\" shows:\n        Row 9 (y=9): `9 . 0 . . T T T . . .`\n        Row 8 (y=8): `8 . T . . 1 . T . . .`\n        So (4, 9) is `T` (Enemy tail) and (4, 8) is `1` (Enemy head). Correct.\n        Enemy is at (4, 8).\n\n3.  **Move Evaluation (Head at (1, 9)):**\n    *   **UP:** Y=10. Off board. **Death.**\n    *   **DOWN:** (1, 8). This is occupied by my own body (the segment immediately behind my head). **Death.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** (2, 9). Is this safe?\n        *   Board state at (2, 9): `.` (Empty).\n        *   Enemy: Head at (4, 8). Body at (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9)... Enemy occupies (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9). (2, 9) is not occupied by enemy.\n        *   **Result:** Safe.\n    *   **LEFT:** (0, 9).\n        *   Board state at (0, 9): `.` (Empty).\n        *   Enemy: Not at (0, 9).\n        *   **Result:** Safe.\n\n4.  **Strategic Decision:**\n    *   My only valid moves are LEFT or RIGHT.\n    *   I am at the top wall. I cannot go UP.\n    *   I am stacked on my own tail, so I cannot go DOWN.\n    *   **Right (2, 9):** Moves towards the apple at (3, 5) cluster (via x-axis). The path is clear East: (3,9), (4,9) is currently occupied by Enemy tail, but Enemy moves every turn. (4,9) will likely be empty next turn unless the enemy moves back into it (unlikely). (5,9) is Enemy body.\n    *   **Left (0, 9):** Moves towards the corner.\n        *   From (0, 9), valid future moves would be DOWN (to 0,8) or RIGHT (back to 1,9). This traps me in a corner with limited options. Left puts me in a \"dead end\" logic trap.\n        *   From (2, 9), I have more space. I can go DOWN eventually to access the apples at (3,5) etc.\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   Right moves towards the *cluster* of apples: (3,5), (6,5), (7,5).\n        *   Left moves towards *isolation*.\n    *   **Safety Check on Right:** (2, 9) is currently empty. Enemy is at (4, 8). If Enemy moves UP (to 4,9) or LEFT (to 3,8) or RIGHT (to 5,8), it does not affect (2, 9). If Enemy moves UP to (4,9), I am at (2,9), safe. If Enemy moves LEFT to (3,8), safe. There is no immediate head-on collision risk at (2, 9).\n    *   **Decision:** RIGHT.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move Right to (2,9) to position myself towards the central apples (3,5, 6,5, 7,5). Avoid getting trapped in the corner.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

However, the enemy body will shift as the enemy moves.\n    *   **Final Choice:** **DOWN** is the superior move. It moves me away from the wall, opens up the board, and sets a trajectory towards the apple at (3, 5) without moving towards the enemy's current position or body. It provides more future options.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Descend from the top wall to the center-left region. Secure the apple at (3, 5) to tie the score (6-6).

If the enemy moves LEFT, we trade heads. While trading removes the competition, if I die, I lose the game immediately. Since the enemy has more apples (7 vs 5), a trade favors the opponent (if we both die, the one with more apples wins).\n    *   RIGHT (3, 8) moves me to a safe cell that is not adjacent to the enemy head (distance 1 to enemy, but safe from head-on unless enemy moves UP). From (3, 8), I can potentially move DOWN to (3, 7) next turn if the enemy moves away, or chase the apple at (3, 5).\n    *   Therefore, RIGHT is the safest move to guarantee survival this turn while maintaining a path toward the apples.\n\n**Plan:** Move RIGHT to (3, 8) to avoid immediate collision with the enemy.

They have NO safe moves and will die this turn.\n\n**Apple analysis:**\n- Moving DOWN to (3, 4) gets no apple immediately\n- Moving LEFT to (2, 5) gets no apple immediately\n- Moving RIGHT to (4, 5) gets no apple immediately\n\nSince the enemy is trapped and will die, I should focus on positioning for the remaining apples. The cluster at (6, 5) and (7, 5) are closest to me.\n\n**Best move:**\nRIGHT to (4, 5) - this moves me toward the apple cluster at (6, 5) and (7, 5), keeping my options open for future moves while avoiding any collision with the doomed enemy.\n\n**Strategy Note:**\nThe enemy snake #0 is completely trapped and will die this turn. I should focus on collecting the remaining apples efficiently. The cluster at (6, 5) and (7, 5) is the closest and most accessible. After those, I can work on (0, 6) and (2, 6). I need to be careful not to trap myself while collecting apples.\n\nRIGHT",
