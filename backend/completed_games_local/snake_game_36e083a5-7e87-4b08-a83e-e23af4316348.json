It cannot reach any of my possible moves in one turn (since it can only move to (9,8), (8,9), (9,10 invalid, or (10,9 invalid) - so only (9,8) or (8,9) are safe for it). So no risk of head-on collision or hitting its body (it has no body yet).\n\nTherefore, all four moves are safe.\n\n**Which moves are beneficial?**\n- There is an apple at (4,6) which is to my right (same row, x=4 vs my x=2). Moving RIGHT (to (3,6)) gets me closer to that apple.\n- There is an apple at (5,5) which is down and right from me. Moving RIGHT (to (3,6)) or DOWN (to (2,5)) both get me closer to that.\n- The apple at (1,9) is up and left, but far. (0,8) is also far. (9,0) is very far.\n\nSo moving RIGHT seems best to approach (4,6) and (5,5). Also, moving RIGHT to (3,6) gives me many future options (open spaces around).\n\nLEFT to (1,6) is also safe but moves away from the cluster of apples at (4,6) and (5,5). UP and DOWN are neutral.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI should aim for the nearest apples: (4,6) and (5,5). Since the enemy is at (9,9), it might go for (1,9) or (0,8) first. I have time to collect the apples near me. After getting (4,6), I can go to (5,5) or others. Avoid moving towards the enemy until necessary.\n\n**Final decision:**\nRIGHT is the best move to get closer to apples and maintain flexibility.\n\nRIGHT",

So LEFT is invalid.\n- All other moves are within the board (0-9).\n- Enemy snake is at (9,7): \n  - Its possible moves: UP to (9,8), DOWN to (9,6), LEFT to (8,7), RIGHT is off-board (invalid).\n  - None of my safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) coincide with the enemy's current head or possible moves this turn. Enemy has no body to worry about.\n  - So no risk of head-on collision or running into enemy body this turn.\n\nTherefore, safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Strategy for apples:**\n- The closest apple is at (5,5) \u2014 one step DOWN and one RIGHT. \n  - RIGHT to (5,6) gets closer to (5,5) \u2014 next turn I could go DOWN to (5,5) to eat it.\n  - DOWN to (4,5) is also close to (5,5) \u2014 next turn I could go RIGHT to (5,5).\n- Another apple at (3,5) is close: DOWN to (4,5) is adjacent to it (next turn LEFT to (3,5)).\n- UP to (4,7) moves away from these apples and toward the top, but there are apples at (1,9) and (0,8) which are farther.\n- RIGHT to (5,6) is also safe and opens more options.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI should prioritize eating apples quickly to grow and gain points. The enemy is still small and far away (at (9,7)), so I can focus on the cluster of apples near me: (5,5) and (3,5). \nAfter eating one, I should plan to avoid trapping myself. Since I have a body segment, I must avoid moving backwards into it.\n\nFor this turn, both DOWN and RIGHT are good. DOWN gets me directly adjacent to (3,5) and (5,5) (via (4,5)), while RIGHT gets me to (5,6) adjacent to (5,5). \nI choose DOWN to (4,5) because it positions me equally well for both (3,5) and (5,5) next turn, and it might be slightly safer to avoid the enemy's potential path (which is currently far).\n\n**Next turn plan:**\nFrom (4,5), I can go:\n- LEFT to (3,5) to eat the apple there.\n- RIGHT to (5,5) to eat that apple.\n- UP to (4,6) but that is my current head position? Actually, my body will be at (4,6) and (3,6) after I move? Wait, let's clarify movement:\n\nAfter I move DOWN to (4,5), my head becomes (4,5), and my body segments shift: the old head (4,6) becomes the first body segment, and the tail (3,6) remains? Actually, since I didn't eat an apple, I don't grow. So my entire snake moves: head to (4,5), and the body segment (which was at (3,6)) moves to the old head (4,6). So my new body will be [(4,6)] and tail at (4,6)? Wait no:\n\nStandard snake movement without growth: the head moves to the new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment. So after moving DOWN:\n- Head was (4,6) -> moves to (4,5)\n- Body segment at (3,6) moves to (4,6)\nSo my new snake: head at (4,5), body at [(4,6)].\n\nTherefore, next turn from (4,5), I cannot go UP to (4,6) because that is my body. So safe moves would be LEFT to (3,5), RIGHT to (5,5), or DOWN to (4,4).\n\nSo going DOWN now to (4,5) sets me up to eat either (3,5) or (5,5) next turn.\n\nRIGHT to (5,6) would give next turn options: DOWN to (5,5) to eat, or LEFT to (4,6) but that is my body? Actually, after moving RIGHT:\n- Head to (5,6)\n- Body segment moves to (4,6)\nSo next turn from (5,6), I cannot go LEFT to (4,6) (body), but can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nSo both are good, but DOWN is more direct for the apples.\n\nI'll go DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

So no immediate collision risk.\n\nNow, look at apples:\n- (5,5) is adjacent to my head (RIGHT, but that move is fatal).\n- (4,1) is south, (1,9) and (0,8) are northwest, (9,0) is far southeast.\n\nSo no immediate apple in a safe direction. We need to plan for future.\n\nAfter moving:\nIf UP to (3,6): next turn possible moves: UP (3,7), DOWN (3,5) (current head, but will be body?), LEFT (2,6), RIGHT (4,6) (my tail currently, but will move?).\n\nWait: after I move, my body updates: head moves to new location, and the tail moves? Actually, since I didn't eat an apple, I don't grow. So my body will shift: new head at move, then the old head becomes next segment, and tail moves away.\n\nCurrent body: head (3,5), then (4,5), then (4,6) (tail).\nIf I move UP to (3,6), new head (3,6), body becomes [(3,5), (4,5)] and tail (4,6) disappears? Actually, no: since no apple eaten, length remains same. So new body: head (3,6), then (3,5), then (4,5) [tail?]. Actually, the entire snake moves: head to new cell, each segment moves to the previous position of the segment in front.\n\nSo after moving UP:\n- Head to (3,6)\n- Segment behind head (currently at (4,5)) moves to (3,5)\n- Tail (currently at (4,6)) moves to (4,5)\n\nSo new body: [(3,6), (3,5), (4,5)]? Wait, let's list:\nOld: head (3,5), body [ (4,5), (4,6) ]\nAfter move UP:\nHead to (3,6)\nFirst body segment (previously at (4,5)) moves to old head (3,5)\nSecond body segment (previously at (4,6)) moves to (4,5)\nSo new body: [ (3,5), (4,5) ] and tail at (4,5)? Actually, the tail is the last segment: (4,5).\n\nSimilarly for other moves.\n\nSo for each safe move:\n\n1. UP to (3,6): \n   Next turn, head at (3,6), body at (3,5) and (4,5). Possible next moves: UP (3,7), DOWN (3,5) (body), LEFT (2,6), RIGHT (4,6) (open). So 3 safe directions.\n\n2. DOWN to (3,4):\n   Next turn, head at (3,4), body at (3,5) and (4,5). Possible moves: UP (3,5) (body), DOWN (3,3), LEFT (2,4), RIGHT (4,4). So 3 safe directions.\n\n3. LEFT to (2,5):\n   Next turn, head at (2,5), body at (3,5) and (4,5). Possible moves: UP (2,6), DOWN (2,4), LEFT (1,5), RIGHT (3,5) (body). So 3 safe directions.\n\nAll safe moves give similar future mobility.\n\nNow, long-term strategy: There are apples at (1,9), (0,8) in the top-left, (4,1) south, (5,5) east (but not safe now), (9,0) far.\n\nTo reach (1,9) or (0,8), moving LEFT and UP is good. DOWN to (3,4) goes toward (4,1).\n\nEnemy is at (9,5), far away.\n\nI should move toward the cluster of apples in the top-left: (1,9) and (0,8).\n\nSo moving LEFT or UP is better. DOWN goes away from them.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT: \n- UP to (3,6) is closer to (1,9) in y-direction.\n- LEFT to (2,5) is closer in x-direction.\n\nAlso, after UP, I can go LEFT to (2,6) etc., or after LEFT, go UP to (2,6).\n\nBut UP might be slightly better because it increases y-coordinate toward the top apples.\n\nAlso, note apple at (4,1) is south, but that is not priority.\n\nPlan: Move toward (1,9) via UP and LEFT.\n\nSo for this turn, either UP or LEFT is good.\n\nI'll choose UP to get closer.\n\nFinal move: UP\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nMove toward top-left apples (1,9) and (0,8) via incremental UP and LEFT moves. Avoid going too far right where enemy is. Keep an eye on (4,1) as backup, but top-left is priority.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nUP",

UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy snake (ID #1) at (9,3):**\nEnemy can move:\n- UP: (9,4)\n- DOWN: (9,2)\n- LEFT: (8,3)\n- RIGHT: off board (invalid)\n\nNone of my safe moves (UP: (3,8), LEFT: (2,7), RIGHT: (4,7)) are in these enemy moves. So no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and strategy:**\nMy long-term plan (from previous rationale) is to target top-left apples: (1,9) and (0,8). Currently at (3,7):\n- UP (3,8): moves directly toward higher y (closer to apples at y=8 and y=9)\n- LEFT (2,7): moves toward lower x (closer to apples at x=1 and x=0)\n- RIGHT (4,7): moves away from target apples (not beneficial)\n\nRIGHT is less desirable. Between UP and LEFT:\n- UP reduces y-distance: from y=7 to y=8 (apple at (0,8) has y=8, (1,9) has y=9)\n- LEFT reduces x-distance: from x=3 to x=2 (apple at (1,9) has x=1, (0,8) has x=0)\n\nBoth are good, but UP gets me to y=8 faster (only one step away from (0,8) in y-direction). Also, (3,8) is adjacent to (2,8) which could lead to (1,8) and then (1,9) or (0,8).\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**\nAfter UP to (3,8):\n- Body becomes: [(3,7), (3,6)] (tail is (3,6))\n- Next moves from (3,8):\n  - UP (3,9): free\n  - DOWN (3,7): my body (unsafe)\n  - LEFT (2,8): free\n  - RIGHT (4,8): free\nSo 3 safe moves next turn.\n\nAfter LEFT to (2,7):\n- Body becomes: [(3,7), (3,6)]\n- Next moves from (2,7):\n  - UP (2,8): free\n  - DOWN (2,6): free\n  - LEFT (1,7): free\n  - RIGHT (3,7): my body (unsafe)\nSo also 3 safe moves.\n\nAfter RIGHT to (4,7):\n- Body becomes: [(3,7), (3,6)]\n- Next moves from (4,7):\n  - UP (4,8): free\n  - DOWN (4,6): free\n  - LEFT (3,7): my body (unsafe)\n  - RIGHT (5,7): free\nSo 3 safe moves.\n\nAll three safe moves offer similar future mobility (3 options each). So we prioritize direction toward target apples.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Decision:**\nUP is most directly toward the top apples (especially (0,8) at y=8). LEFT is also good but UP gets me to y=8 immediately. From (3,8), I can then go LEFT to (2,8) or UP to (3,9) to approach (1,9) or (0,8).\n\nRIGHT moves away from the target and should be avoided.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best choice.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**\nContinue moving toward top-left apples (0,8) and (1,9). From (3,8), consider LEFT to (2,8) to get closer in x-direction. Avoid enemy area (right side). Also note apple at (5,5) is nearby but not priority unless path changes. Enemy is at (9,3) and likely to move away.\n\nUP",

UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy snake (ID #1) at (9,2):**\nEnemy can move:\n- UP: (9,3)\n- DOWN: (9,1)\n- LEFT: (8,2)\n- RIGHT: off board (invalid)\n\nNone of my safe moves (UP: (3,9), LEFT: (2,8), RIGHT: (4,8)) are in these enemy moves.

Currently at (3,8):\n- UP (3,9): moves directly to y=9, adjacent to (1,9) (x=1,y=9) and (0,8) (x=0,y=8) is nearby.\n- LEFT (2,8): moves toward lower x (closer to apples at x=1 and x=0), and (0,8) is at same y=8.\n- RIGHT (4,8): moves away from target apples (not beneficial).\n\nRIGHT is less desirable. Between UP and LEFT:\n- UP gets me to (3,9), which is very close to (1,9) (only 2 steps left) and (0,8) (3 steps down-left).\n- LEFT gets me to (2,8), which is adjacent to (1,8) and then (1,9) or (0,8).\n\nBoth are good, but UP puts me at y=9, which is the top row and near (1,9). From (3,9), I can go LEFT to (2,9) and then (1,9) to eat it.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**\nAfter UP to (3,9):\n- Body becomes: [(3,8), (3,7)]\n- Next moves from (3,9):\n  - UP: off board (invalid)\n  - DOWN: (3,8) \u2013 my body (unsafe)\n  - LEFT: (2,9) \u2013 free\n  - RIGHT: (4,9) \u2013 free\nSo only 2 safe moves next turn (LEFT and RIGHT).\n\nAfter LEFT to (2,8):\n- Body becomes: [(3,8), (3,7)]\n- Next moves from (2,8):\n  - UP: (2,9) \u2013 free\n  - DOWN: (2,7) \u2013 free\n  - LEFT: (1,8) \u2013 free\n  - RIGHT: (3,8) \u2013 my body (unsafe)\nSo 3 safe moves.\n\nAfter RIGHT to (4,8):\n- Body becomes: [(3,8), (3,7)]\n- Next moves from (4,8):\n  - UP: (4,9) \u2013 free\n  - DOWN: (4,7) \u2013 free\n  - LEFT: (3,8) \u2013 my body (unsafe)\n  - RIGHT: (5,8) \u2013 free\nSo 3 safe moves.\n\nUP has lower future mobility (only 2 moves) compared to LEFT and RIGHT (3 moves). However, UP is critical to reach the top apple (1,9) quickly. Since enemy is far away, I can afford to go to (3,9) and then move left along the top row.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Decision:**\nUP is the best to immediately advance toward (1,9). Even though it reduces my options next turn, I can safely move LEFT or RIGHT from (3,9) to continue toward the apple. LEFT is also good, but UP gets me to the top row faster.\n\nRIGHT should be avoided as it moves away from the target.\n\nTherefore, choose UP.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:**\nFrom (3,9), move LEFT to (2,9) to approach (1,9). Then eat (1,9) if possible. After that, target (0,8). Avoid getting trapped at the top edge. Enemy is still far on the right.\n\nUP",

Given these positions, my immediate priority is to move towards an apple without putting myself at risk of collision with the enemy snake or the board edges.\n\nSince my last move was DOWN, and I'm now at (9, 2), moving DOWN again seems like a promising strategy as it keeps me on a path towards the apple at (9, 0) without immediately putting me at risk.

Also, after eating, my body will be longer but I'll have options from (1,9): \nNext turn from (1,9):\n- UP: (1,10) off board (invalid)\n- DOWN: (1,8) empty\n- LEFT: (0,9) empty\n- RIGHT: (2,9) my body (invalid unless I move away)\nSo two safe moves (DOWN and LEFT) next turn, which is good.\n\nDOWN (2,8) gives me mobility but delays eating.\n\nTherefore, LEFT is the best choice.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat (1,9) now, then next turn go LEFT to (0,9) to set up for (0,8) or DOWN to (1,8) to eventually target (0,8) or (4,1).

Wait \u2014 current body segments will move forward when I move, so my old head (1,9) becomes my neck, old neck (2,9) becomes body segment. So some will shift.  \n  Actually: After I move to (0,9), my body becomes: [new head (0,9), old head (1,9), (2,9), (3,9),(3,8)] \u2014 but since I didn't eat an apple, body length remains same, so tail (3,8) is removed? No \u2014 length stays because no apple eaten. So movement:  \n  Snake body mechanics: I move head to new cell, each body segment moves into the previous position of the segment ahead of it. So new body: head=(0,9), then segment at (1,9), then (2,9), then (3,9). Tail (3,8) disappears because total length=4 (3 apples collected so length 4). Yes. So (1,9) will be my body segment next turn, so from (0,9), RIGHT is into my body, invalid.\n\nThus from (0,9) next turn, valid cells: DOWN (0,8) apple, LEFT invalid (off board), UP invalid, so only DOWN available. That\u2019s a dead end in terms of choice \u2014 risky.\n\n- If I move **DOWN** to (1,8):  \n  From (1,8) next turn: UP (1,9) will be empty (my old head position is now body? Let's track: current body: [(2,9),(3,9),(3,8)]. After moving to (1,8), new body: head (1,8), then (1,9), then (2,9), then (3,9) \u2014 tail (3,8) gone. So (1,9) is my neck next turn, so UP to (1,9) is into my body \u2014 invalid.\n\n  Valid moves from (1,8) next turn: LEFT (0,8) apple, DOWN (1,7) empty, RIGHT (2,8) empty. So 3 possible moves next turn \u2014 much safer.\n\nSo DOWN leaves more future mobility; LEFT forces me to (0,8) apple next turn with no other option (corner).\n\nWhich apple to target? (0,8) is close either way. Walking through (1,8) allows flexibility; going (0,9) forces commitment to (0,8) immediately with risk of trapping myself at the top edge.\n\nSince enemy is far and not threatening, preserving mobility is better. So choose DOWN now, then next turn eat (0,8) or go elsewhere if needed.\n\n**Long-term plan**: From (1,8) next turn, eat (0,8) if possible, then perhaps head down left side toward (0,1) or cross toward middle apples. Keep enemy in mind \u2014 it's growing slowly but far away.\n\n**Final move**: DOWN",

Possible moves:\n- UP (5,2): safe\n- DOWN (5,0): safe\n- LEFT (4,1): apple there \u2014 tempting for enemy\n- RIGHT (6,1): neck (invalid)\n\nNo immediate threat to me.\n\n**Path options:**\n- DOWN (1,6): Opens future moves DOWN to (1,5) etc., or RIGHT to (2,6). Gets me closer to apple (0,1) but must wrap around carefully.\n- RIGHT (2,7): Closer to apples (2,8) (almost directly above!) and (5,7). But next turn from (2,7):\n  - UP (2,8): apple!

Board shows at (3,8): from diagram, row 8: \"T . A . . . . . . .\" so (3,8) is free (dot). No snake there.\n- DOWN: (3,6) - free (row 6 all dots except? (3,6) is dot)\n- LEFT: (2,7) - my own body segment (next after head) - invalid\n- RIGHT: (4,7) - free? Row 7: \"...0 . A . . . .\" so (4,7) is dot (free)\n\nSo safe: UP, DOWN, RIGHT\n\n**Enemy snake #1 at (4,2):**\nPossible moves: UP (4,3), DOWN (4,1) (body - invalid), LEFT (3,2), RIGHT (5,2)\nNo immediate threat to my positions since far away (y=2 vs y=7).\n\n**Apple targeting:**\n- Closest apple: (2,8) is very close (distance |3-2| + |7-8| = 1+1=2), but note I just moved to (3,7) and last rationale planned to go UP to (2,8) but now I'm at (3,7) so (2,8) is adjacent.\n- (5,7) is also close (distance 2).\n- (0,1) and (2,0) are far.\n\n**Plan:**\n- Going UP to (3,8) doesn't get an apple immediately, but sets up for (2,8) next turn? Actually (2,8) is to the left and up from (3,8)? From (3,8), LEFT would go to (2,8) which has an apple. So UP then LEFT next turn to get apple.\n- Going RIGHT to (4,7) moves toward (5,7) apple (distance 1 from there).\n- DOWN to (3,6) moves away from most apples.\n\nBest options: UP or RIGHT.\n\nConsider future mobility:\n- After UP to (3,8): next moves: UP (3,9), DOWN (3,7) (body?), LEFT (2,8) (apple), RIGHT (4,8). So 3 safe moves (if DOWN is body? current body at (2,7) and (1,7) etc - (3,7) will be neck next turn? Actually after moving, body becomes [head new, old head, ...]. So after UP to (3,8), body: [(3,8), (2,7), (1,7), (0,7), (0,8)]. Then DOWN to (3,7) would be the old head (2,7) is not at (3,7)? Actually (3,7) is free? But wait: when I move, the tail moves? Since no apple eaten, length remains same. So tail (0,8) will be cut off. So body becomes: [(3,8), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (0,7)]? Wait no: the body segments shift: new head at (3,8), then the previous head (3,7) becomes segment2, then (2,7) segment3, (1,7) segment4, and tail (0,8) is lost since no growth. So actually (3,7) becomes my body segment (neck). So DOWN from (3,8) would be (3,7) which is body - invalid. So from (3,8): UP (3,9), LEFT (2,8) (apple), RIGHT (4,8) are safe. DOWN invalid. So 3 moves safe.\n\n- After RIGHT to (4,7): body becomes [(4,7), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (0,7)]? Tail (0,8) lost. Then next moves: UP (4,8), DOWN (4,6), RIGHT (5,7) (apple). LEFT (3,7) is body. So 3 safe moves.\n\nBoth similar mobility.\n\nBut UP leads to being able to grab (2,8) apple next turn (if go LEFT), while RIGHT leads to (5,7) apple next turn (if go RIGHT).\n\nAlso note: (2,8) apple is closer to current head? Actually from (3,7), (2,8) is distance |3-2| + |7-8|=2, while (5,7) is |3-5|+|7-7|=2. Same.\n\nBut UP then LEFT gets apple next turn, and also (3,8) is safe now.\n\nHowever, consider enemy: snake #1 might move? But no threat.\n\nAlso, long-term: after eating (2,8), I can go to (2,9) then right, etc.\n\nBut RIGHT to (4,7) also good.\n\nAnother point: last rationale planned to go UP to (2,8) but I ended up at (3,7) because I moved RIGHT last turn? Actually last turn I moved RIGHT from (2,7) to (3,7). So the plan was to go UP to (2,8) but I didn't? Wait, last move was RIGHT. So I changed plan? Actually last rationale said \"RIGHT\" but then explanation said \"Best choice seems UP\". There might be inconsistency. But we are at (3,7) now.\n\nTo follow the plan toward (2,8) apple, I should go LEFT? But LEFT is invalid (body). So I cannot go directly to (2,8). So I need next turn.\n\nSo UP is the way to set up for (2,8).\n\nRIGHT goes toward (5,7).\n\nBoth are good.\n\nBut since (2,8) is very close and I can get it next turn, UP is preferable.\n\nAlso, UP avoids potential future conflict? Not really.\n\nSo choose UP.\n\n**Final move: UP**\n\nPlan for next turn: From (3,8), go LEFT to (2,8) to eat the apple, then from there go UP to (2,9) or RIGHT to (3,8) (but careful: after eating, body grows so (3,8) might be body? Actually after eating at (2,8), body becomes length 6: head at (2,8), then (3,8), (3,7), (2,7), (1,7), (0,7). So from (2,8), UP (2,9) free, DOWN (2,7) body, LEFT (1,8) free? (1,8) is currently free? Board shows row 8: \"T . A . ...\" so (1,8) is dot? Actually (0,8) was my tail, but it will be gone after this move? Actually this turn I move to (3,8), so tail (0,8) is lost. So (1,8) becomes free. And RIGHT (3,8) is body. So next turn from (2,8) after eating: safe moves UP and LEFT. So plan to go UP to (2,9) after eating.\n\nUP",

But (1,8) is occupied by my body currently (tail end), so next turn it might be gone because we move forward; checking: my body segments move when I move, so currently body positions shift after move: tail was at (1,7), now head at (1,9), body: (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (3,7), (2,7) \u2192 yes, (1,8) is empty next turn actually \u2014 body segments shift: old head (2,9) becomes new segment 1, so (1,8) should be free. Actually quicker check: Snake length 6, current body coords except head; after moving to (1,9), segments: head=(1,9), segment1=(2,9), segment2=(2,8), segment3=(3,8), segment4=(3,7), segment5=(2,7) \u2014 correct, so (1,8) is free next turn indeed.  \n\n- If I go RIGHT to (3, 9):  \n  Enemy cannot reach (3, 9) in 1 move from (5,4) \u2192 safe this turn.  \n\n**Apples:** closest ones: (5,7) \u2014 from (3,9) I'd be closer to (5,7) than from (1,9). Actually, paths:  \nFrom (3,9): path to (5,7) = down, down-ish right (Manhattan 4).  \nFrom (1,9): path to (5,7) = longer (Manhattan 8).  \nAlso (0,1) benefits from going left, but left edge is cramped and risky later.  \n\n**Future flexibility:**  \nFrom (3,9) next turn: can go DOWN (3,8)\u2014now my body? wait check: after moving right this turn, body will occupy (2,9), (2,8), (3,8)? Actually let's track precisely:  \n\nCurrent: head=(2,9), body=[(2,8),(3,8),(3,7),(2,7),(1,7)].  \nMove RIGHT: new head=(3,9), body becomes: old head (2,9) then (2,8), (3,8), (3,7), (2,7). So (3,8) is still in my body next turn. So from (3,9):  \nPossible moves next turn:  \n- UP: off board.  \n- DOWN: (3,8) body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT: (2,9) body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT: (4,9) safe.  \nSo from (3,9), next turn only RIGHT is safe \u2014 that's restricted.  \n\nFrom (1,9) after LEFT move: body = (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (3,7), (2,7).  \nNext turn from (1,9):  \n- UP: off board.  \n- DOWN: (1,8) free? Yes \u2013 not in new body list above.  \n- LEFT: (0,9) free.  \n- RIGHT: (2,9) body \u2013 invalid.  \nSo from (1,9), next turn safe moves: DOWN, LEFT \u2014 better flexibility.  \n\nThus left seems better for flexibility despite apple distance.  \n\n**Risk of enemy cutting off space**: enemy at (5,4). If I go left path toward (0,1) apple, enemy can move toward center apples but unlikely to meet me soon unless I go toward (5,5).  \n\nGiven this, plan: go LEFT this turn to (1,9), then next turn go DOWN (1,8) to work toward bottom apples (0,1) in a few moves.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move toward lower left to collect (0,1) apple, then across bottom to (2,0) apple. Keep enemy in check; if it grows from (5,5), it may block center apples later.  \n\nLEFT",

Good flexibility.  \n  - Moves me closer to (0,1) and (2,0).  \n\n- **LEFT to (0,8)**:  \n  - Then next turn: body becomes [(1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8)] (tail drops).  \n  - From (0,8): UP (0,9) off board? Wait: (0,9) is top-left corner. Actually (0,9) is valid coordinate (board has (0,9) as '.'). But check: UP to (0,9) \u2192 empty? Currently (0,9) is empty (board shows '.'). However, after moving LEFT, my body will include (1,8) and (1,9). So next turn from (0,8):  \n    - UP: (0,9) \u2192 empty? But careful: next turn body is [(1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (2,8), (3,8)]. So (0,9) is not my body? Actually no, my body segments are only those listed. So UP (0,9) should be safe.  \n    - DOWN: (0,7) free.  \n    - LEFT: (-1,8) off board \u2192 invalid.  \n    - RIGHT: (1,8) my body \u2192 invalid.  \n    So only UP and DOWN safe. Less flexible (only 2 moves).  \n\nDOWN gives more options and moves me directly toward bottom apples. LEFT leads to edge with fewer choices.  \n\nPlan: Go DOWN to (1,7) to maintain flexibility and approach (0,1) and (2,0). Enemy is far and not threatening.  \n\n**END RATIONALE**  \n\nDOWN",

Its possible moves:\n- UP: (6,9) \u2192 empty ('.') \u2192 safe.\n- DOWN: (6,7) \u2192 its own body (segment #1) \u2192 invalid.\n- LEFT: (5,8) \u2192 empty \u2192 safe.\n- RIGHT: (7,8) \u2192 empty \u2192 safe.\nSo enemy can move UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nManhattan distance to your head (1,5) is 5 (dx=5, dy=3). No immediate collision risk.\n\nApples: Closest are (0,1) and (2,0). From (1,5), (0,1) is 5 units away (dx=1, dy=4) and (2,0) is 6 units away (dx=1, dy=5). But note (2,0) is directly below and to the right? Actually (1,5) to (2,0): dx=1, dy=5? Wait: (2,0) is at x=2,y=0. From (1,5): dx=1, dy=-5. Similarly (0,1): dx=-1, dy=-4.\n\nSo both require moving down and left. However, (2,0) is closer in terms of path? Actually (0,1) is 5 steps (1 left+4 down) and (2,0) is 6 steps (1 right+5 down). So (0,1) is slightly closer.\n\nNow evaluate each safe move:\n\n1. DOWN to (1,4):\n   - Moves closer to both apples (0,1) and (2,0).\n   - From (1,4):\n        UP (1,5) \u2192 body? Next body: [(1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9)] (tail (2,9) drops). So (1,5) is not body anymore (since head moves and tail drops). Actually after move, body becomes: head (1,4), then (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8) [since tail (2,9) drops]. So (1,5) is now body segment. So UP is invalid.\n        DOWN (1,3) free.\n        LEFT (0,4) free.\n        RIGHT (2,4) free.\n   So 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Good flexibility.\n\n2. LEFT to (0,5):\n   - Moves left, closer to (0,1).\n   - From (0,5):\n        UP (0,6) free.\n        DOWN (0,4) free.\n        LEFT (-1,5) off-board \u2192 invalid.\n        RIGHT (1,5) \u2192 body (now segment #2) \u2192 invalid.\n   So only 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN). Less flexible.\n\n3. RIGHT to (2,5):\n   - Moves right, away from target apples.\n   - From (2,5):\n        UP (2,6) free.\n        DOWN (2,4) free.\n        LEFT (1,5) \u2192 body (segment #2) \u2192 invalid.\n        RIGHT (3,5) free.\n   So 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). But moves away from apples.\n\nDOWN is best: progresses toward apples (especially (0,1)) and has good future options. LEFT has only 2 moves, which might lead to trapping. RIGHT is counterproductive.\n\nEnemy is far away and not an immediate threat.\n\nPlan for next turns: From (1,4), likely move DOWN or LEFT to approach (0,1). Possibly go to (0,4) then (0,3), etc. Avoid going too far right.\n\nDOWN\n**START RATIONALE**\nCurrent head (1,5). Safe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Chose DOWN to (1,4) to approach apples (0,1) and (2,0). From (1,4), will have moves DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (UP will be body). Next turn, prefer DOWN or LEFT to get closer to (0,1). Enemy #1 is at (6,8) and not a threat now. Continue targeting bottom-left apples.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Future options after each safe move**\n\nFrom (1,3):\n\n**(a) DOWN to (1,2):**\n\n- Options from (1,2) next turn:  \n  UP \u2192 (1,3) will be my new body (current head) \u2192 unsafe  \n  DOWN \u2192 (1,1) free  \n  LEFT \u2192 (0,2) free  \n  RIGHT \u2192 (2,2) free  \n\nSo 3 safe moves.\n\nCloser to apples (0,1) (Manhattan = 2) and (2,0) (Manhattan = 3).\n\n**(b) LEFT to (0,3):**\n\n- Options from (0,3):  \n  UP \u2192 (0,4) free  \n  DOWN \u2192 (0,2) free  \n  LEFT \u2192 (-1,3) off-board \u2192 unsafe  \n  RIGHT \u2192 (1,3) will be my body (current head) \u2192 unsafe  \n\nSo 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN). Could corner myself soon.\n\n**(c) RIGHT to (2,3):**\n\n- Options from (2,3):  \n  UP \u2192 (2,4) free  \n  DOWN \u2192 (2,2) free  \n  LEFT \u2192 (1,3) will be my body (current head) \u2192 unsafe  \n  RIGHT \u2192 (3,3) free  \n\nSo 3 safe moves.\n\nBut apple (2,0) is below-right? Wait \u2014 (2,0) is directly below from here: y decrease. Right then down is longer path.\n\nActually from (1,3):\n\n- (0,1): dist 3 (down 2, left 1)  \n- (2,0): dist 4 (left 1, down 3 \u2014 no: check: 1->0 = left 1? Wait coordinates: 1,3 to 2,0: dx=+1, dy=-3 ==> Manhattan = 4) Actually dist: (2-1)=1, (0-3)=-3 abs=3, so Manhattan=4? Wait 1+3=4 yes.  \n\nSo apple (0,1) is closer than (2,0).\n\n---\n\n**4. Plan for apples**\n\nApple (0,1): head to (0,3) or (1,2) sets up approach.\n\nBut (0,3) \u2192 fewer options. (1,2) preserves more options.\n\nAlso (1,2) allows next turn: DOWN to (1,1), then LEFT to (0,1) apple.\n\nLEFT now \u2192 (0,3), then maybe DOWN to (0,2), then LEFT? Wait (0,2)\u2192(0,1) is one step. But possible dangers and options reduced.\n\nBest flexibility: DOWN to (1,2) keeps movement open to left or right to avoid dead ends.\n\n---\n\n**5. Avoid potential collision?**\n\nEnemy head at (7,9), moves DOWN to (7,8) or RIGHT to (8,9). Not near me; no risk of collision.\n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term plan note for next turns:**\n\nFrom (1,2), go to (1,1) or (0,2) depending on clear path to (0,1). Then eat (0,1). After that, consider (2,0) next, but check enemy progress; enemy may head for top-right apples (8,9) and (9,8). Keep middle open for escape.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Actually last turn's apples included (0,2) too, but let's check board state above \u2014 yes, apple at (0,2) is listed separately from apples list? Wait board shows A at (0,2) indeed.\n\nActually the listing says apples at: (0, 1), (2, 0), (6, 1), (9, 8), (0, 2) \u2014 so indeed two apples in column 0: (0,1) and (0,2).\n\nEnemy: head at (8, 9), body: [(7, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 7), (5, 7)].\n\n---\n\n**1.

Dangers from enemy:**\n\nEnemy at (8,9): possible moves  \n- UP: (8,10) off-board \u2192 unsafe  \n- DOWN: (8,8) safe  \n- LEFT: (7,9) its body \u2192 unsafe  \n- RIGHT: (9,9) safe  \n\nSo enemy won't reach me this turn (far away).\n\n---\n\n**3. Apple eating strategy:**  \nEating apple at (0,2) now (LEFT) is possible. That means next turn I grow: head at (0,2), body: old head (1,2) becomes first body segment.\n\nIs eating now safe for next turn?  \nFrom (0,2) after eating:  \nPossible moves:  \n- UP: (0,3) free  \n- DOWN: (0,1) APPLE but will it be blocked by body next turn? Let's check: if I move LEFT now:  \nHead to (0,2). Body grows so: [(0,2), (1,2), (1,3), ... etc]. So (1,2) is body tomorrow.  \n\nNext turn from (0,2):\n- UP: (0,3) free  \n- DOWN: (0,1) free (apple) \u2192 safe  \n- LEFT: (-1,2) off-board \u2192 unsafe  \n- RIGHT: (1,2) my body \u2192 unsafe  \n\nSo only UP and DOWN safe. That\u2019s 2 moves \u2014 a restriction but not immediately deadly. Also (0,1) apple is below \u2014 I should plan DOWN next turn to eat that.\n\nHowever, maybe better to leave (0,2) apple for later and keep more options open.\n\n---\n\n**4. Compare moves:**\n\n**LEFT (eat apple at (0,2)):**  \nGrow to length 7. Then stuck on left edge next turn (only UP/DOWN moves). Could plan to eat (0,1) next turn for length 8.\n\n**DOWN to (1,1):**  \nNext turn options likely:  \nFrom (1,1):  \n- UP: (1,2) will be tail? Wait careful: if I move DOWN: head to (1,1), body = [(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), ...] \u2014 no, that\u2019s incorrect: head moves to (1,1), so body segments shift: new body = old head (1,2) becomes first body segment, then (1,3), (1,4), ..., tail (1,7). So (1,2) is body next turn.  \n\nSo moves from (1,1):  \nUP \u2192 (1,2) body \u2192 unsafe  \nDOWN \u2192 (1,0) free  \nLEFT \u2192 (0,1) apple  \nRIGHT \u2192 (2,1) free  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 moves). More flexibility.\n\n**RIGHT to (2,2):**  \nFrom (2,2):  \nUP \u2192 (2,3) free  \nDOWN \u2192 (2,1) free  \nLEFT \u2192 (1,2) body \u2192 unsafe  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3,2) free  \nSafe: UP, DOWN, RIGHT \u2014 3 moves. Moves toward middle but away from apples (0,1) and (0,2).\n\n---\n\n**5. Plan:**\n\nBest to eat nearby apples soon but avoid trapping myself. Apples at (0,1) and (0,2) are both accessible via LEFT/DOWN moves.\n\nSequence:  \nIf I go LEFT now, eat (0,2), then next turn DOWN to (0,1) apple \u2014 length 8 quickly. Risk: stuck on left edge but can go up/down, maybe escape later.\n\nAlternatively: DOWN to (1,1) \u2192 next turn LEFT to eat (0,1) apple \u2192 tail at (1,7) so body not blocking much yet. Then from (0,1) can go UP to (0,2) apple if enemy not close.\n\nSecond approach seems better: eat (0,1) first, then (0,2), staying more flexible.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:** Go DOWN to (1,1) to set up eating (0,1) next turn while keeping options open.\n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**\nFrom (1,1): Plan to eat (0,1) apple next turn unless enemy interferes. After eating (0,1), consider eating (0,2) to grow safely along the edge. Watch enemy movement \u2014 currently far away in top-right corner. Keep escape route open by not getting stuck on edges too long.\n\nDOWN",

Its possible moves:\n- UP: (9,10) off-board \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN: (9,8) is an apple (A) \u2192 safe (but enemy might eat it?).\n- LEFT: (8,9) is its own body \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (10,9) off-board \u2192 unsafe.\nSo enemy can only move DOWN to (9,8) to eat the apple there. That will make it grow to length 6 (currently length 5, same as me). It is far away (top-right corner) and won't interact with me this turn.\n\n**Apple strategy:**\nThere are two apples nearby: (0,1) and (0,2). I should eat them to grow and gain points. Since I am at (1,1), moving LEFT to (0,1) eats the apple immediately. This is safe and beneficial.\n\nAfter eating (0,1), I grow to length 7. My head becomes (0,1), and my body becomes [(0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)]. The tail is still at (1,6) but will shift when I move.\n\nNext turn from (0,1) (if I eat it):\n- UP: (0,2) is an apple \u2192 safe (if not eaten by enemy? But enemy is far).\n- DOWN: (0,0) is empty (board shows \".\" at (0,0)) \u2192 safe.\n- LEFT: (-1,1) off-board \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (1,1) is my body (since it becomes the first segment after growth) \u2192 unsafe.\nSo only UP and DOWN are safe. That is acceptable because I can eat (0,2) next turn (UP) to grow further and then have more options (from (0,2) I could go UP to (0,3) or DOWN to (0,1) but (0,1) will be body then? Actually careful: after moving UP to (0,2) and eating, body becomes [(0,2), (0,1), (1,1), ...] so (0,1) is body, so only UP and DOWN would be safe from (0,2) as well? Actually from (0,2):\n- UP: (0,3) free\n- DOWN: (0,1) body \u2192 unsafe\n- LEFT: off\n- RIGHT: (1,2) free? Wait (1,2) is body? Initially my body has (1,2) as first segment after head (0,1) and (1,1). Actually it's messy but we can plan step by step.\n\nBut eating (0,1) now is good to gain an apple and grow. I can handle the next moves.\n\nAlternatively, if I go DOWN to (1,0) or RIGHT to (2,1), I avoid the edge but delay apple eating. Since enemy is also at 5 apples (same as me), I need to collect apples to stay ahead.\n\n**Decision:**\nBest to eat the apple at (0,1) via LEFT. This gains an apple, grows to length 7, and sets me up to eat (0,2) next turn. The enemy is far and not a threat immediately.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating (0,1) and then (0,2), I'll be at length 8 and on the left edge. Then I should try to escape the edge by moving UP to (0,3) and then RIGHT to (1,3) etc., to avoid being trapped. The enemy is growing too (might eat (9,8)), so I need to be efficient.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state after the last move (LEFT to (0,1) to eat the apple).\n\n**Current positions:**\n- My head: (0, 1) (just ate the apple)\n- My body: [(0,1) (new head), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)]? Wait, careful: after eating, the snake grows. So my new body should be: head at (0,1), then the previous head (1,1) becomes the next segment, then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and the tail is still at (1,6) for now. But when I move this turn, the tail will not move because I grew (so length becomes 7). Actually, the growth happens after the move: when you eat an apple, you grow by one segment at the end of the turn. So the tail doesn't move this turn, and the new segment is added at the tail. So the body is now: head at (0,1), then (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), and tail at (1,6). So I have length 7.\n\nBoard state shows (0,1) is now my head (0) and (1,1) is my body (T). Also, the apple at (0,1) is gone.\n\nApples now: (2,0), (6,1), (0,2), (9,5), (3,7)  [since (0,1) was eaten]\n\nEnemy snake #1: it moved DOWN to (9,8) to eat the apple there? Last turn it had only one move: DOWN to (9,8). So now it should be:\n- Head at (9,8) (ate the apple)\n- Body: [(9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7)] and it grew to length 6 (same as me before I ate). But now I have length 7, enemy has length 6.\n\nUpdated enemy: head (9,8), body: [(9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (6,8), (6,7)]? Actually, when it moves and eats, the tail doesn't move, so it adds a segment. So it has length 6.\n\n**Now from my head (0,1):**\nPossible moves:\n- UP: (0,2) is an apple (A) -> safe (no body or enemy there)\n- DOWN: (0,0) is empty (.) -> safe\n- LEFT: (-1,1) off-board -> unsafe\n- RIGHT: (1,1) is my body (T) -> unsafe\n\nSo only UP and DOWN are safe.\n\nIf I move UP to (0,2), I eat the apple and grow to length 8. This is beneficial.\nIf I move DOWN to (0,0), I don't eat an apple, but it is safe.\n\n**Enemy analysis:**\nEnemy head at (9,8). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (9,9) is its own body -> unsafe\n- DOWN: (9,7) is empty (.) -> safe\n- LEFT: (8,8) is empty (.) -> safe\n- RIGHT: (10,8) off-board -> unsafe\n\nSo enemy can go DOWN or LEFT. It might go towards the apple at (9,5)? Or (3,7)? But it is far.\n\n**Strategy:**\nI should eat the apple at (0,2) to grow to length 8 and gain a point. This puts me ahead of enemy (6 vs 6? Actually enemy has 6 apples, I have 6? Wait no: I just ate one, so I have 7 apples (collected), enemy has 6 apples (collected). So after eating (0,2), I have 8, enemy has 6.\n\nThis is a good lead. After eating (0,2), my head will be at (0,2). Then from there:\n- UP: (0,3) empty -> safe\n- DOWN: (0,1) is my body -> unsafe\n- LEFT: off\n- RIGHT: (1,2) is my body? (1,2) is in my body: [(1,1), (1,2), ...] -> unsafe\nSo only UP is safe. That means I would be forced to go UP to (0,3) next turn. That is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if I go DOWN to (0,0), I don't eat, but then from (0,0):\n- UP: (0,1) body -> unsafe\n- DOWN: off\n- LEFT: off\n- RIGHT: (1,0) empty -> safe\nSo only RIGHT is safe. That would lead me to (1,0), which is free. Then I could go to other apples later. But this delays eating.\n\nGiven that eating the apple now gives me a lead and the enemy is growing, it is better to eat.\n\n**Risk of head-on collision?** None, enemy is far.\n\nSo best to go UP to (0,2) and eat.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter moving UP to (0,2) and eating, I will be at (0,2) with length 8. Next turn, only UP to (0,3) is safe. Then from (0,3):\n- UP: (0,4) free\n- DOWN: (0,2) body -> unsafe\n- LEFT: off\n- RIGHT: (1,3) free (currently empty)\nSo I can go UP or RIGHT. I should plan to escape the left edge by going RIGHT to (1,3) as soon as possible to avoid being trapped. After (0,3), I should go RIGHT to (1,3) to get more freedom. Then I can navigate towards other apples like (3,7) or (6,1).\n\nFor now, UP to eat the apple.\n\nUP",

This move positions me well for potential future moves towards the apples while monitoring the enemy snake's movements to adjust my path as necessary and avoid potential collisions.\n\nShort-term plan: Continue to move towards the nearest apple while monitoring the enemy snake's movements to adjust my path as necessary and avoid potential collisions.
