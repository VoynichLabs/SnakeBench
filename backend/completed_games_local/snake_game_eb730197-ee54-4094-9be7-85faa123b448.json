Next few turns, prefer staying in the **top and right-central lanes** to build a long horizontal/vertical presence that can eventually seal off the opponent\u2019s escape routes from the bottom-right.

No immediate collision threats this turn, but we gotta think two steps ahead, chat \ud83d\ude08\n\nFirst, check all four moves:\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,8)**: that\u2019s our own body segment directly behind the head. Moving backwards = instant self bonk \ud83d\udc80 Eliminated.\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7,8)**: on board, empty, safe \u2705\n- **UP \u2192 (6,9)**: on board, empty, safe \u2705\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,7)**: on board, empty, safe \u2705\n\nSo we\u2019ve got **UP, DOWN, RIGHT** as live options.\n\nNow, what\u2019s the enemy cooking?  \nFrom (9,1) with body (9,0):\n\n- UP \u2192 (9,2) safe\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,1) is an apple \ud83c\udf4e\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,0) is its own body (illegal)\n- RIGHT \u2192 off-board\n\nThey\u2019re almost certainly going **LEFT** to (8,1) to grab that apple and start a bottom-right farm. That means a cluster of apples for them at (8,1), (8,2), (8,5), (7,4)... If we sit back and drift aimlessly, we let them outscale us and threaten future head-on trades.\n\nSo which of our moves best fights that?\n\n### Comparing our options\n\n**DOWN (6,7)**  \n- Keeps us central, gives 3 follow-up moves next turn.\n- But it pulls us *away* from the strong apple line at the top (0,9), (5,9), and the juicy (4,8).\n- Also doesn't contest the enemy\u2019s right side fast enough. Too passive for how many apples they can chain down there.\n\n**RIGHT (7,8)**  \n- Pushes toward upper-right, good for eventual boxing paths.\n- Leaves us 3 follow-ups next turn (UP, RIGHT, DOWN).\n- But we delay our next apple \u2014 nearest ones are 3+ steps away. Meanwhile, enemy is probably farming 1 apple per turn in the bottom-right. That\u2019s how you fall behind and lose head-on leverage later.\n\n**UP (6,9)**  \n- Puts us on the top wall with 2 strong follow-ups next turn:  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (5,9) which is an apple \ud83c\udf4e  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (7,9) to start sliding toward upper-right if we prefer position over immediate food.\n- From UP, we can grab **(5,9)** in one more move, giving us a fast length-3 while still staying near the top and able to drift right afterward.\n- This line lets us both:\n  - Keep pace with the enemy\u2019s early growth, and  \n  - Build a long body across the **top** that can later curl down and help cage them in from above.\n\nSo UP = best combo of **safe**, **fast apple access**, and **good future pressure**.\n\n---\n\n### Long-term note to future me \ud83c\udfaf  \n\nYou\u2019re going **UP** now to (6,9). Next turn, heavily favor **LEFT to (5,9)** for the apple and quick growth unless something wild changes. That gives you a nice 3-length snake sitting on the top row, ready to slide right across the top to claim upper-right control. From there, build a horizontal wall near the top, then start probing downward on the right side to shrink the enemy\u2019s space and eventually force them into risky corridors or a bad head-on when we\u2019re longer.\n\nUP",

So much room to coil up and build that **top-left fortress** \ud83d\ude24\n\nMore follow\u2011up options = harder to get boxed in = better long-term control.

NEXT. \ud83d\udc80\n\n#### \u2705 UP \u2192 (3,9) \u2014 APPLE\n- Board cell (3,9) = **apple**, no body, no enemy.\n- Enemy at (7,4) is **too far** to contest that square this turn.\n- We **eat**, so:\n  - New head: **(3,9)**\n  - Body becomes: **[(3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (5,9), (6,9)]**\n  - Tail at (6,9) **stays** (we grow).\n\nNext-turn options from (3,9):\n- UP \u2192 off-board \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 into neck (3,8) \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,9) empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,9) empty \u2705\n\nSo we\u2019d have **2 safe directions** (LEFT, RIGHT) and **+1 apple** and **+1 length**.\n\nMeanwhile enemy:\n- From (7,4) they have UP (7,5), LEFT (6,4), DOWN (7,3) \u2014 **no apples**.\n- They almost certainly **don\u2019t grow** this turn.\n\nSo if we go **UP**, score becomes:\n- **Us: 5**, Enemy: **4**  \nWe take the **lead and length edge**, which is MASSIVE for future head-on threats and boxing.\n\n#### \u2705 LEFT \u2192 (2,8)\n- Cell (2,8) is empty.\n- No apple, no body, no enemy.\n- New snake (no apple \u2192 tail moves):\n  - Head: **(2,8)**\n  - Body: **[(3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (5,9)]**\n\nNext-turn options from (2,8):\n- RIGHT \u2192 into neck (3,8) \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,8) empty \u2705\n- UP \u2192 (2,9) empty \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,7) \ud83c\udf4e \u2705\n\nNice **3 safe options**, including a very tasty route into that left apple cluster. But:\n- We **don\u2019t eat** this turn.\n- Enemy also likely doesn\u2019t eat.\n- Score remains **4\u20134**, no tempo gain.\n\nIt\u2019s safe, it\u2019s flexible, but it\u2019s **leaving free value on the table** with a guaranteed apple above us.\n\n#### \u2705 DOWN \u2192 (3,7)\n- Cell (3,7) is empty.\n- New snake:\n  - Head: **(3,7)**\n  - Body: **[(3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (5,9)]**\n\nNext-turn options from (3,7):\n- UP \u2192 into neck (3,8) \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,7) \ud83c\udf4e \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,7) empty \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,6) empty \u2705\n\nAgain **3 safe options**, including quick access to the lower part of that same apple cluster. Good for shaping a central wall later, but:\n- We still **don\u2019t eat** this turn.\n- We give up the chance to get ahead on apples while completely safe.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare: Safety, Tempo, and Future Control\n\nAll three of **UP / LEFT / DOWN** are safe this turn. So what separates them?\n\n- **Apple tempo:**\n  - **UP** \u2192 we eat **now**, enemy doesn\u2019t \u2192 **5\u20134** lead.\n  - LEFT/DOWN \u2192 we **skip** a free apple while they might reposition toward their cluster.\n- **Future options:**\n  - UP \u2192 2 safe moves next turn (LEFT/RIGHT) but still in massive open space.\n  - LEFT/DOWN \u2192 3 safe moves, plus easy access to the cluster at (2,7/6/5).\n- **Strategic goal:**  \n  We want to:\n  - Get **bigger** than the enemy ASAP \ud83d\udcaa\n  - Then use that size to:\n    - Threaten **head-on collisions** (we win ties in size),\n    - Build long body **walls** to cut the board and box them in.\n\nGoing **UP** gives us:\n- Immediate **size and score lead**\n- Maintains perfectly fine mobility\n- Keeps us in the **top lane**, ideal for later dropping a vertical wall down through the center once we\u2019re huge.\n\nLEFT or DOWN are fine, but they\u2019re \u201cplay it safe, miss free value\u201d moves. We\u2019re not here to play timid, chat. We\u2019re here to **dominate the board**. \ud83d\ude24\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Mini Game Plan (Next Few Turns)\n\n- This turn: **UP to (3,9)** for the guaranteed apple and **5\u20134** lead.\n- Then:\n  - Slide **LEFT or RIGHT** along the top to extend a wide horizontal body.\n  - Drift toward the apple cluster on the upper-left (0,9, 1,7, 2,7, 2,6, 2,5).\n- Once we\u2019re clearly longer than the enemy:\n  - Start dropping a **vertical wall** down around x\u22483\u20135,\n  - Aim to **cut the board** so he\u2019s trapped in the right/bottom quadrant.\n  - Look actively for chances to force a **head-on** when we\u2019re the bigger snake.\n\nWe take the free apple, we take the lead, and we start setting up the choke. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\nUP",

Remember that.\n\nApples relevant to us:\n- **(0,9)** left corner top\n- Left cluster: **(1,7), (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (1,3), (2,3)**  \nEnemy has the central/right cluster near **(6,5), (8,5)** etc.\n\nWe\u2019re far from each other: no immediate collision threats this turn.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Step 1: Check All Four Directions\n\nFrom **(3,9)**:\n\n### \u2b06\ufe0f UP \u2192 (3,10)\n- Y = 10 is OFF THE BOARD.\n- That\u2019s instant **death**. \u274c\n\n### \u2b07\ufe0f DOWN \u2192 (3,8)\n- That\u2019s literally our **neck**.\n- Moving backwards into our own body = **auto-lose**. \u274c\n\n### \u2b05\ufe0f LEFT \u2192 (2,9)\n- Check board: (2,9) is **empty**.\n- Not our body, not enemy, not off-board.\n- Enemy is way down at y=5, can\u2019t contest this square.  \n\u2705 **Safe this turn.**\n\nIf we go LEFT, new snake (no apple \u2192 tail moves):\n- New head: **(2,9)**\n- Body: **(3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (5,9)**\n- Tail at (6,9) disappears.\n\nNext-turn options from (2,9):\n- UP \u2192 off-board \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 into neck (3,9) \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,9) empty \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,8) empty \u2705\n\nSo we keep **2 clean escape routes** and stay near **both**:\n- Top-left apple at (0,9),\n- Big left cluster below (2,7/6/5).\n\n### \u27a1\ufe0f RIGHT \u2192 (4,9)\n- Check board: (4,9) is **empty**.\n- So it\u2019s **safe this turn**. \u2705\n\nAfter moving RIGHT (no apple \u2192 tail moves):\n- New head: **(4,9)**\n- Body: **(3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (5,9)**\n- Tail (6,9) disappears.\n\nNext-turn options from (4,9):\n- UP \u2192 off-board \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,8) = solid body \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,9) = body \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,9) = body (and not a guaranteed safe escape under these rules) \u274c/sketchy\n\nSo going RIGHT **basically corners us** on the very next turn with no clean, obvious safe squares. That\u2019s the kind of line where you misread one detail and just DIE on stream. No thanks.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Step 2: Compare LEFT vs RIGHT\n\nBoth are alive this turn, so we look at:\n\n- **Future mobility:**\n  - LEFT \u2192 at least **two** safe outs (LEFT, DOWN).\n  - RIGHT \u2192 we\u2019re almost fully wrapped in our own body next move.\n- **Apple access:**\n  - LEFT:\n    - Toward **(0,9)** top-left apple.\n    - Easy drop into the **(1,7, 2,7, 2,6, 2,5)** cluster.\n  - RIGHT:\n    - Drifts us toward an area with **no nearby apples** and **less space**.\n- **Enemy pressure:**\n  - They\u2019re chilling around **(7,5)** with access to apples at **(6,5)** and **(8,5)**.\n  - We don\u2019t need to race directly at them yet; we\u2019re already **ahead on apples and length**.\n  - Better to grow safe on the left, then use our MASS to force fights later.\n\nSo LEFT keeps us:\n- Safe \u2705\n- Flexible \u2705\n- Closer to a **huge apple economy** on the left \u2705\n- Ready to build a big horizontal wall across the top \u2705\n\nRIGHT is unnecessarily spicy and potentially self-trapping.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Long-Term Plan (Future Me, READ THIS)\n\n- This turn: **Go LEFT to (2,9)**, keep control of the **top-left** corner.\n- Next few turns:\n  - Farm the **top-left apple (0,9)** and the **left column cluster** around (2,7/6/5).\n  - Build a **thick horizontal body** across the top rows as we grow.\n- Once we\u2019re up by **2\u20133 apples and segments**, start drifting **down the left-center** (x\u22482\u20133):\n  - Form a vertical wall to **cut the board**.\n  - Trap the enemy in a smaller right/bottom region.\n  - Look for a **forced head-on** when we\u2019re clearly bigger so a double-KO gives us the **win by apples**.\n\nWe scale first, we wall second, we HUNT third. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc80\n\nLEFT",

Instant death.  \n- Illegal.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (3,9)**  \n- That\u2019s our neck (first body segment). Moving directly backwards into our own body is a loss.  \n- Illegal.\n\nSo only two actually legal moves: **LEFT** and **DOWN**.\n\n---\n\n#### LEFT \u2192 (1,9)\n\n- (1,9) is empty. Safe this turn.\n- No apple, so we move and tail (5,9) comes off.\n- New snake:\n  - Head: (1,9)\n  - Body: (2,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8)\n\nNext-turn options from (1,9):\n- UP \u2192 off-board (dead)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,9) = neck (backwards, dead)\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,9) = apple, safe\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,8) = empty, safe\n\nSo we\u2019d still have 2 safe outs and easy access to the corner apple at (0,9), but we\u2019re staying high instead of diving into the big apple minefield below. Slower tempo on growth.\n\n---\n\n#### DOWN \u2192 (2,8)\n\n- (2,8) is empty. Safe this turn.\n- No apple, so tail (5,9) comes off.\n- New snake:\n  - Head: (2,8)\n  - Body: (2,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8)\n\nNext-turn options from (2,8):\n- UP \u2192 (2,9) = neck (backwards, dead)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,8) = our own body (dead)\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,7) = apple, safe\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,8) = empty, safe\n\nAgain, 2 clean outs (DOWN to apple, LEFT to space), but this line pushes us **straight into** the huge apple cluster on the left side:\n\n- One move away from (2,7),\n- Then immediately near (1,7), (2,6), (2,5), etc.\n\nThe enemy at (6,5) can\u2019t contest this area for many turns; they\u2019re locked in the mid-right. So we basically get a private farm on the whole left column and left mid.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Enemy considerations\n\nEnemy head: (6,5), body: (7,5), (7,4), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2).\n\nTheir legal moves:\n- UP \u2192 (6,6) empty\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,4) empty\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,5) apple\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,5) = neck (illegal)\n\nThey\u2019re very likely to go LEFT onto the apple at (5,5), growing and reinforcing their mid-right presence. That\u2019s fine: while they grind mid, we can completely dominate the left and top-left, then swing in with a longer, fatter snake to box them.\n\nNo immediate risk of any head-on with us this turn whether we go LEFT or DOWN. Our choice is purely about long-term control and growth speed.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategic choice\n\nWhat do we want?\n\n- Fast growth in an uncontested region to outscale the enemy.\n- Maintain multiple safe future moves.\n- Start transitioning from \u201ctop wall\u201d to a strong left/mid presence that can eventually cut the board.\n\n**LEFT** keeps us in the corner and delays entry into the apple mine.\n\n**DOWN**:\n- Keeps us safe,\n- Immediately lines us up with (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), (1,7),\n- Starts building a vertical presence in the upper-left, a perfect base for a future \u201ccurtain\u201d down the board that can cage the enemy on the right.\n\nSo we dive. We take space and we take tempo.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd3 Note to future me\n\n- From (2,8), prioritize eating down the (2,7 \u2192 2,6 \u2192 2,5) lane while maintaining a thick, non-self-trapping shape.\n- Keep our main mass around x = 1\u20133, y = 5\u20139 for now to:\n  - Secure all left-side apples,\n  - Build both a horizontal top wall and a descending vertical wall.\n- Once we\u2019re up by a couple of apples and clearly longer, start drifting toward center from the left to partition the enemy into a smaller right-side box and force them into a bad fight.\n\nDOWN",

We need safe growth and board control, then we hunt.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Check all four directions\n\nFrom our head (2,8):\n\n**UP \u2192 (2,9)**  \n- That\u2019s our own body, and specifically the neck segment behind us.  \n- Moving backwards into our own body = instant death.  \n- Illegal.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (3,8)**  \n- Also our own body.  \n- Moving into any body segment = death.  \n- Illegal.\n\nSo only two real options: **LEFT** and **DOWN**.\n\n---\n\n### 2) LEFT \u2192 (1,8)\n\n- (1,8) is empty on the board.  \n- No apple there, so we move and drop our tail (5,8).\n\nNew snake if we go LEFT:\n- Head: (1,8)  \n- Body: [(2,8), (2,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8)]  \n\nNext turn from (1,8):\n- UP \u2192 (1,9) empty (safe)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0,8) empty (safe)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1,7) apple (very nice)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,8) = neck (illegal)\n\nSo we\u2019d have **three** safe outs (UP, LEFT, DOWN) and easy access to:\n- Apple at (1,7),\n- Then later apples at (2,7), (2,6), (2,5), etc.\nWe also keep away from the enemy in the short term by sliding toward the extreme left.\n\nDownside: no apple this turn, we stay at 5 while enemy could move toward more apples.\n\n---\n\n### 3) DOWN \u2192 (2,7)\n\nCurrent (2,7) is an apple and not occupied by any snake.\n\n- Moving DOWN is immediately safe.\n- We eat the apple, we **grow**, and keep our tail (5,8).\n\nNew snake if we go DOWN:\n- Head: (2,7)  \n- Body: [(2,8), (2,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8)]  \n- Apples: goes to **6** (we tie the enemy)\n\nNext turn from (2,7):\n- UP \u2192 (2,8) = neck (illegal)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,7) apple (safe)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,6) apple (safe)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,7) empty (safe)\n\nSo again we get **three** safe outs (LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT), but here we are lined up for an entire vertical apple conveyor belt:\n- (2,7) we just eat,\n- then (2,6),\n- then (2,5),\n- with (1,7) on the side,\n- and later things like (2,3), (2,0) further down.\n\nWe also keep a wide horizontal body across y=8: (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), plus the vertical stack at x=2. That\u2019s good for **board control**, making it harder for the enemy to come up into the top-left later.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Enemy possibilities this turn\n\nEnemy head at (5,5), body behind: (6,5), (7,5), (7,4), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2).\n\nLegal moves for them:\n- UP \u2192 (5,6) empty  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,4) empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,5) empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,5) neck (illegal)\n\nNo apples directly adjacent, and we are far away.  \nCritical point: there is **no** square that both heads can reach in one move, so:\n\n- No head-on collisions with the enemy this turn,\n- No way we walk into their body by accident from our current spot.\n\nSo our choice is purely about long-term positioning and farming.\n\n---\n\n### 5) LEFT vs DOWN: which is better?\n\n**LEFT (1,8):**\n- Safer positioning on extreme left edge,\n- No apple this turn (we stay behind 5\u20136),\n- Sets us up for (1,7) next, then we can swing into (2,7), (2,6), etc.\n- Shorter snake (length 6), less immediate impact on board control.\n\n**DOWN (2,7):**\n- Immediate apple: we go to 6\u20136, erasing their lead right now.\n- Keeps our tail, so we\u2019re **longer and fatter** on the map, claiming more space across the top.\n- Lines us up for a fast chain: (2,7) \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 (2,5) while still having lateral escape options.\n- Puts us slightly more central, meaning we can get into future fights faster once we\u2019re ahead.\n\nBoth maintain multiple safe future moves. The big differences: tempo and map pressure. We want to be aggressive, grow, and then use that length lead to bully them with potential head-on threats. DOWN does exactly that, without any immediate downside.\n\nWe\u2019re not forced into a fight yet; even going DOWN we can always pivot left later via (1,6)/(1,5) if the center gets hot.\n\n---\n\n### Note to future me (strategy for next few turns)\n\n- After going DOWN to (2,7), strongly consider:\n  - Continuing the apple chain DOWN: (2,6) \u2192 (2,5),\n  - Or mixing in LEFT to (1,7) to keep a foothold on the extreme left.\n- Watch enemy if they drift left toward (3,5)/(2,5). If they contest (2,5), avoid simultaneous dives there that could cause a tied head-on; instead, peel off to (1,6)/(1,5)/(1,3) and keep farming on the left.\n- Aim to build a length and apple lead of at least +2. Once we\u2019re clearly ahead, start driving from the left/mid toward the center to box them onto the right side and look for winning head-on or trapping patterns.\n\nDOWN",

Dead even. Time to take control.\n\nWe\u2019re in the upper-left, enemy is mid-right-ish below us. Big vertical apple lane right under us on x=2 plus a cluster around (2,5)-(3,5). Perfect battleground.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from our head (2,7)\n\n**UP \u2192 (2,8)**  \n- That\u2019s our own neck segment. Moving backwards = instant death.  \n- \u274c Illegal.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (3,7)**  \n- Empty square, no apple.  \n- Safe this turn, but let\u2019s check follow-ups:\n  - From (3,7):\n    - UP \u2192 (3,8) = our body \u2192 death.\n    - LEFT \u2192 (2,7) = our body \u2192 death.\n    - DOWN \u2192 (3,6) empty.\n    - RIGHT \u2192 (4,7) empty.\n  - Only **two** safe outs (DOWN, RIGHT) and no immediate apple.  \n  - Also drifts us closer horizontally to the enemy without gaining food. Why give up tempo for no apple?\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (1,7)**  \n- There\u2019s an apple at (1,7) \u2705  \n- No snake body there. Safe and we grow.\n- New snake if we go LEFT:\n  - Head: (1,7)  \n  - Body: [(2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8)]\n- Next turn from (1,7):\n  - UP \u2192 (1,8) empty  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (0,7) empty  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (1,6) empty  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (2,7) neck (illegal)  \n- So **three** safe outs. Nice and flexible.  \n- BUT: this drifts us to the extreme left and cedes the juicy central apple lane (2,6 \u2192 2,5 \u2192 2,3\u2026) to the enemy. They likely go LEFT to (3,5) and then (2,5) and farm while we sit in the corner. Do we really want to hand them the whole mid-left for free? \ud83d\ude0f\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (2,6)**  \n- There\u2019s an apple at (2,6) \u2705  \n- No snake body there. Safe and we grow.\n- New snake if we go DOWN:\n  - Head: (2,6)  \n  - Body: [(2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8)]\n- Next turn from (2,6):\n  - UP \u2192 (2,7) neck (illegal)  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (1,6) empty  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (2,5) apple  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (3,6) empty  \n- Again **three** safe outs and **we\u2019re sitting directly on the central apple pipeline**.\n\nSo both LEFT and DOWN are safe, both give us an apple and keep 3 options next turn. The question is: _which lane gives us more control over the enemy and the board?_\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What\u2019s the enemy likely to do?\n\nEnemy head: (4,5). Legal moves (can\u2019t go back into (5,5)):\n\n- UP \u2192 (4,6) empty  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,4) empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,5) **apple**  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,5) neck (illegal)\n\nThey have a free apple at (3,5). From there, they can chain into **(2,5)** right under us. If we let them have the whole column 2\u20133 apple set uncontested while we drift left, they\u2019ll snowball a lead.\n\nWe want to be **aggressive**, not passive: contest that space, grow, and then use our thick body to wall them out and eventually threaten a winning collision when we\u2019re ahead.\n\nDOWN puts us right in that central lane. LEFT gives them that lane for free.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Future collision considerations if we go DOWN\n\nSuppose:\n- We go **DOWN \u2192 (2,6)** (eat apple, 7 apples total),\n- They go **LEFT \u2192 (3,5)** (eat apple, also 7).\n\nNext turn:\n- Our options from (2,6):  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (1,6)  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (2,5) apple  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (3,6)\n- Their options from (3,5):  \n  - UP \u2192 (3,6)  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (3,4)  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (2,5) apple  \n\nNotice:\n- **(2,5)** is contested: we could go DOWN, they could go LEFT \u2192 potential head-on on an apple.  \n- **(3,6)** is contested: we could go RIGHT, they could go UP \u2192 another potential head-on.\n\nBut here\u2019s the key: **we are not forced to choose those contested squares.**  \nWe can always bail out to (1,6) or take the safer of the two targets depending on how we read their next move.\n\nRight now apples are tied 6\u20136, and will likely be 7\u20137 after both eat one. We don\u2019t want a 50\u201350 double-KO draw when tied; we want to **grow first, then weaponize head-on threats** once we\u2019re ahead.\n\nGoing DOWN gives us that leverage: high apple tempo, central control, and still plenty of escape squares to dodge bad coinflips.\n\nGoing LEFT delays the fight and basically hands them the key central apples without pressure. That\u2019s not how we bully the board.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Verdict this turn\n\n- UP: suicide into our neck. \u274c  \n- RIGHT: safe but no apple and fewer future outs; worse board control. \u26a0\ufe0f  \n- LEFT: safe apple, good flexibility, but strategically **too passive**, ceding central apples. \ud83d\ude12  \n- DOWN: safe apple, strong central presence, high future apple tempo, and multiple escape options. Exactly the kind of **aggressive, space-controlling** play we want. \u2705\n\nWe slam **DOWN** here, grab the apple, and set up to either continue the 2-column apple conveyor or sidestep to 1,6 if the enemy crowds (2,5)/(3,6). We stay alive, keep options, and start shaping the midboard for a future box-in.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Long-term plan to future me\n\n- After going DOWN to (2,6):\n  - If enemy moves toward (3,5)/(2,5), **do not blindly race them** into (2,5) or (3,6) for a 50\u201350 head-on while apples are tied.  \n  - Prefer safe expansion: go LEFT to (1,6) if their head is at (3,5) and looks ready to contest, then work the left-side apple cluster (1,3,1,2,1,0,2,0) and circle back.\n- Goal over next ~5\u20138 turns:\n  - Build at least a +2 apple lead while extending a long vertical/horizontal wall from our current top-left mass down toward the mid-left (columns 1\u20133).\n  - Once we\u2019re ahead on apples, start steering into lines where a desperate enemy has to choose between:\n    - Crashing into our body, or\n    - Taking a **losing** head-on collision against our longer snake.\n- Always watch contested central squares (2,5), (3,6), (3,3). Only take a head-on line when we\u2019re clearly ahead on apples and can accept a mutual KO as a win.\n\nDOWN",

But what can enemy do?\n\n- Enemy LEFT to (2,5) is also legal, and also grabs that same apple.\n\nIf:\n- We go DOWN to (2,5)\n- They go LEFT to (2,5)\n\nBoth heads land on (2,5) simultaneously \u2192 rules say double KO on head-on. We both die, and since we both hit the apple, likely 8\u20138 draw. With the score tied right now, forcing a big coinflip draw on a contested apple is terrible value. We only want to engineer head-on contact once we\u2019re AHEAD on apples, not when it just throws the game away.\n\nSo DOWN is super high-risk for a whole lot of \u201cprobably draw\u201d.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 RIGHT to (3,6)\n\nSquare (3,6) is empty right now. But from enemy head (3,5):\n\n- They can go UP \u2192 (3,6).\n\nSo if:\n- We go RIGHT \u2192 (3,6)\n- They go UP \u2192 (3,6)\n\nAgain, immediate head-on collision, both die, draw at 7\u20137. No apple even involved this time.\n\nSo RIGHT gives them another painless way to bail the game out into a draw. Why give our rival a free emergency eject button?\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 LEFT to (1,6)\n\nCheck it:\n\n- (1,6) is empty.\n- Enemy from (3,5) cannot reach (1,6) in one move; they only have (2,5), (3,6), (3,4).\n\nSo:\n- No self-collision.\n- No enemy-body collision.\n- Zero chance of head-on this turn.\n\nWe don\u2019t get an apple this move, but we do:\n- Stay totally safe.\n- Avoid both contested squares (2,5) and (3,6) where head-ons can happen.\n- Slide toward the left-side apple cluster (1,3), (1,2), (1,0), (2,0), still with space to work.\n\nLikely enemy behavior?\n- Their greedy line is LEFT to (2,5) for the apple.\n- If they do that while we go to (1,6), next turn we\u2019re slightly above-left of them, ready to race down the left side while they\u2019re in the central-column mess. We keep full control over whether to ever offer a head-on; they\u2019re the one exposed between our big top-left wall and the center.\n\nUP is suicide, DOWN and RIGHT are both \u201cdraw-bait\u201d moves, LEFT is the only move that:\n- Keeps us alive.\n- Keeps us away from forced coinflip head-ons while the score is tied.\n- Preserves strong future options into the lower-left apples and long-term board control.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Mini-plan to future me\n\n- From (1,6), watch where their head goes:\n  - If they take (2,5), we start working down the left side apples (1,5)\u2192(1,4)\u2192(1,3) etc, building a long vertical wall and aiming for an apple lead.\n  - Use our big, growing left/top mass to carve out a safe corridor for us and a shrinking cage for them.\n- Do NOT offer symmetrical head-on collisions until we\u2019re clearly ahead on apples; then we can weaponize them as a winning threat.\n\nLEFT",

We do NOT want that.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare our options\n\n#### \ud83d\udd3a UP to (1,7) [apple]\n\n- We grab the apple at **(1,7)** \u2192 go to **8 apples**.\n- If enemy also takes **(3,3)** this turn:\n  - Score stays tied **8\u20138**, but:\n    - We thicken our big top-left wall.\n    - Our body after move:\n      - (1,7),(1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(2,8),(2,9),(3,9),(3,8),(4,8)\n- Next turn from (1,7) we have:\n  - **LEFT \u2192 (0,7)** (start building a brutal left wall \ud83d\ude0f)  \n  - **UP \u2192 (1,8)** (advance along top)  \n  - No immediate head-on possibilities with any of their likely moves.\n- We **don\u2019t** fall behind in score, and we strengthen the structure that will eventually box them in toward the right/center.\n\nThis keeps things safe, solid, and aggressive in terms of board control.\n\n#### \ud83d\udd3b DOWN to (1,5)\n\n- No apple this turn.\n- If enemy goes **DOWN \u2192 (3,3)** (very plausible):\n  - They gain an apple, go to **8\u20137** ahead.\n  - Now *they* can threaten head-on trades while leading.\n- If they instead go **LEFT \u2192 (2,4)**:\n  - Next turn, apple at **(2,5)** becomes a **contested tile**:\n    - We from (1,5) can go RIGHT \u2192 (2,5) \ud83c\udf4e\n    - They from (2,4) can go UP \u2192 (2,5) \ud83c\udf4e\n  - That sets up a **head-on coinflip** square directly between us.\n  - With scores tied (or even slightly behind), offering them an easy draw-out is BAD value.\n\nDOWN invites contested apples and future head-on chaos **before** we have a lead. Not it.\n\n#### \u2b05\ufe0f LEFT to (0,6)\n\n- Also no apple.\n- Next turn we\u2019re forced to move **UP or DOWN** along the left wall only (can\u2019t go RIGHT back into neck, and LEFT is off-board).\n- Meanwhile enemy likely eats **(3,3)** and gets to **8\u20137**.  \n- We lose tempo on both **score** and **central influence** for just a lateral slide.\n\nIt\u2019s strictly worse than going UP: less score, less influence, fewer options.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Verdict \ud83c\udfaf\n\nWe want:\n- To **avoid** giving the enemy a free apple lead.\n- To **avoid** early coinflip head-on contests while tied.\n- To **keep building** our massive top-left fortress that will let us funnel them into a smaller, killable space.\n\n**UP to (1,7)** does exactly that:\n- Secures an apple safely.\n- Maintains at least score parity even if they also eat.\n- Extends our wall, setting up a future wrap-down the left side.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Mini-plan for future me\n\n- From **(1,7)**:\n  - Strong follow-up is **LEFT to (0,7)** next, then start marching **down** the left border, building a **huge vertical wall** with our existing top block.\n  - Aim to grab the bottom-left apple cluster (1,3),(2,3),(1,2),(1,0),(2,0) while our body forms a hard boundary that pushes the enemy toward the cramped right/center.\n- Once we **pull ahead on apples**, start engineering lines where any desperate central escape from them risks a **head-on into us** that they *lose* on score. We want them eventually staring at \u201crun into our body or lose on space\u201d \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

So we **accept** being behind for a bit and play for board control + future clamp.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 LEFT vs UP \u2013 who boxes better? \ud83d\ude08\n\n#### \u2b05\ufe0f LEFT \u2192 (0,7)\n\n- New head at **(0,7)**, tail advances off **(4,8)**.\n- Body becomes a fat block from x=1..3 at the top plus that new node at **x=0**.\n- Next turn moves from (0,7):  \n  - **UP \u2192 (0,8)**  \n  - **DOWN \u2192 (0,6)**  \n  - (RIGHT is neck, LEFT is off-board.)\n\nSo still 2 options, but we\u2019re immediately glued to the **left wall**.\n\nPros:\n- Sets up a long left-side wall if we keep marching down.\n- Eventually good for boxing.\n\nCons:\n- We\u2019re committing early to hugging the left border.  \n- Our head is *less central*, so it\u2019s harder later to stretch a long **horizontal** wall across the top to cut them off from the upper half.\n- Enemy is sprinting into the bottom-left apples anyway; we\u2019re not winning that race from up here.\n\n#### \ud83d\udd3a UP \u2192 (1,8)\n\n- New head at **(1,8)**, tail comes off **(4,8)** \u2192 we keep a big chunky block across the **top-center**.\n- New body cells:  \n  (1,8),(1,7),(1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(2,8),(2,9),(3,9)  \n- Next turn moves from (1,8):  \n  - **UP \u2192 (1,9)** (empty, towards top border)  \n  - **LEFT \u2192 (0,8)** (toward left border & apple at (0,9))\n\nPros:\n- Head stays **more central** on the top edge, giving us flexibility:\n  - We can go **UP then LEFT** to grab the apple at **(0,9)** while building a thick top wall.\n  - Or bias further right later if we want a wider horizontal cap over the enemy.\n- Much better geometry for a **\u201clid on the jar\u201d** strategy:  \n  Top wall first, then later slide down the sides to crush them.\n- Still 2 safe options next turn, not boxed.\n\nCons:\n- Same as LEFT: no apple this move, enemy likely leads 9\u20138.\n\nBetween the two, UP gives us **more influential control** over the *entire* upper half of the board instead of instantly gluing us to a corner. If we\u2019re going to win by boxing, we want a **long horizontal ceiling** over them, not just a left rail.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategic angle\n\nWe\u2019re not winning a raw apple race from this position; the enemy is sitting in the middle of a buffet. So:\n\n- Let them farm for a bit.\n- We build the **big cage**:  \n  - Strengthen the **top** first (we\u2019re already 80% there).  \n  - Then extend to **left wall** and eventually start sliding **down**.\n- As our wall grows, their safe region shrinks. The win condition we\u2019re aiming for:\n  - They are forced to either  \n    - ram into our body, or  \n    - run out of space and hit a wall.  \n  - No mutual head-on when they\u2019re ahead.\n\nStaying central-high with **UP** keeps more future lines open to do exactly that.\n\n---\n\n### Note to future me \ud83c\udfaf\n\n- From **(1,8)**, prioritize locking down the **top-left corner** with the apple at **(0,9)** while extending a solid horizontal wall along y=8\u20139.  \n- Once the top is secure, start working toward the **left wall** in a way that keeps at least **two safe moves** each turn (no premature tunnels).  \n- Watch enemy path in the bottom-left cluster: as they push left/down, time your descent on the left side so your body and the edge start forming a funnel that points them toward the **bottom-right** where they can be suffocated.\n\nUP",

Importantly:\n\n- They *cannot* reach anywhere near **(0,8)** or **(1,9)** this turn.\n- No possible head-on collision with us this move.\n\nSo our choice is all about **positioning and future options**, not immediate combat.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 UP vs LEFT \u2013 which one boxes better?\n\n### \ud83d\udd3a If we go UP \u2192 (1,9)\n\nNew shape after moving UP (no apple):\n\n- Head: **(1,9)**\n- Body: (1,8),(1,7),(1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(2,8),(2,9),(3,9)\n\nNext turn from (1,9):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (1,10)** \u274c off board\n- **DOWN \u2192 (1,8)** \u274c our body\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (2,9)** \u274c our body\n- **LEFT \u2192 (0,9)** \u2705 apple\n\nSo we\u2019d have **exactly ONE legal move** next turn: **LEFT to (0,9)**. Forced line.\n\nThen from (0,9) after that, the only legal move becomes **DOWN**, and we\u2019re forced to start sliding **down the left wall** immediately.\n\nSo:\n- UP now = commit to **UP \u2192 LEFT \u2192 DOWN** sequence.\n- We lose flexibility and are basically script-locked for 2\u20133 turns.\n- That breaks our own rule: \u201ckeep MULTIPLE safe follow-up moves.\u201d \ud83d\udeab\n\n### \u2b05\ufe0f If we go LEFT \u2192 (0,8)\n\nNew shape after moving LEFT (no apple):\n\n- Head: **(0,8)**\n- Body: (1,8),(1,7),(1,6),(2,6),(2,7),(2,8),(2,9),(3,9)\n\nNext turn from (0,8):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (0,9)** \u2705 apple\n- **DOWN \u2192 (0,7)** \u2705 empty\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (1,8)** \u274c our body\n- **LEFT \u2192 (-1,8)** \u274c off board\n\nHere we have **TWO safe options** next turn:\n- UP to grab the apple at **(0,9)** and then likely march **RIGHT** across the top \ud83e\uddf1\n- OR start drifting **DOWN** along the left side if we want to begin a vertical wall.\n\nOn top of that:\n\n- If we do **LEFT \u2192 UP**, we end up at **(0,9)** with a body layout that actually lets us move **RIGHT** afterward, continuing a **horizontal ceiling** over the board instead of immediately diving down.\n- That\u2019s PERFECT for a \u201cput the lid on the jar\u201d plan to trap the enemy in the lower half.\n\nSo **LEFT now keeps options open**, while **UP now basically tunnels us into a forced pattern**. We\u2019re not about that autopilot life, are we chat? \ud83d\ude24\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term BOXING plan \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d\n\nNote to future me:\n\n- **Step 1:** Go **LEFT \u2192 (0,8)** now to keep two exits next turn.\n- **Step 2:** Very likely go **UP \u2192 (0,9)** next to:\n  - Snag the free apple \ud83c\udf4e (we need length for fat walls),\n  - Secure the **top-left corner**, and\n  - Then snake **RIGHT** along the top row to build a massive horizontal wall.\n- **Step 3:** Once we\u2019ve got a solid top \u201cceiling\u201d, start working **down the sides** (especially left first) to **shrink their playable space**.\n- Enemy is farming bottom-left? Let them. Our goal: choke the map so hard that eventually:\n  - They must either **ram our body** or\n  - Run out of room and hit a wall.\n- Do **NOT** take head-on trades while we\u2019re behind in apples (8 vs 9). Only consider a head-on collision if we\u2019re **ahead** and can win a double KO.\n\nGiven all that, the aggressive *but smart* play that keeps our future lines wide open is:\n\nLEFT",

With them ahead on apples and us wanting long-term board control to eventually box them in, we take the flexible line.\n\n**Short plan for future turns (note to future self):**\n- From (1,4), watch where their head at (3,1) goes; if they stay low, we can swing RIGHT to (2,4) and then up to (2,5) to claim that apple while building a vertical barrier near x=2.  \n- Keep extending our \u201cleft-side wall\u201d downward and then inward, aiming to seal off the upper half of the board for us and squeeze them into the lower-right.  \n- Avoid symmetric head-ons until we\u2019ve closed the score gap; prioritize routes that keep at least two safe continuations while slowly tightening the noose around their movement options.\n\ndown",

We\u2019re down 8\u201312 on apples, so we **cannot** take a pure head-on trade yet \u2014 if we both die same turn, they win on points. We box, we squeeze, we outscale.  \n\nLet\u2019s run the options:\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves\n\nFrom (1,4):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (1,5)**  \n  Our own body. Instant self-KO. \ud83d\udeab\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (1,3)**  \n  That\u2019s enemy body (they\u2019ve got a column at x=1, y=1\u20133). Running straight into that? Also instant death. \ud83d\udeab\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (0,4)**  \n  Empty right now, no walls, no bodies. \u2705 Safe this turn.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (2,4)**  \n  Also empty, no walls, no bodies. \u2705 Safe this turn.\n\nSo only **LEFT** and **RIGHT** keep us alive.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Look ahead: which side gives us REAL options?\n\nWe don\u2019t just want to live one turn, we want to keep **future branches** open and work toward a choke.\n\n#### LEFT to (0,4):\n\n- After we move there, our neighbors:\n  - UP \u2192 our body at (0,5) \u274c  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 our body at (1,4) \u274c  \n  - LEFT \u2192 off-board \u274c  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (0,3) the *only* safe square \u2705  \n\nSo going LEFT **forces** us down to (0,3) next turn. And from there?\n\n- At (0,3):  \n  - UP \u2192 our body \u274c  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 enemy body at (1,3) \u274c  \n  - LEFT \u2192 off-board \u274c  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (0,2) only safe \u2705  \n\nWe\u2019re basically locking ourselves into a tight **slide straight down the left wall**, into the bottom-left corner, with almost no flexibility. Yeah, there are apples down there (0,1), (1,0), (2,0), (4,0), but that\u2019s also **exactly** where the enemy head can rotate into from (4,1). We\u2019d be low, on the wall, with very predictable moves. That\u2019s how *we* like to trap people\u2026 not where we want to be ourselves \ud83d\ude0f\n\n#### RIGHT to (2,4):\n\nAfter we move RIGHT:\n\n- At (2,4):\n  - LEFT \u2192 back into our neck (1,4) \u274c  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (2,3) enemy body \u274c  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (3,4) enemy body \u274c  \n  - UP \u2192 (2,5) is the only safe square \u2705 (also has an apple!)\n\nSo yes, moving RIGHT also gives us a **forced** follow-up (we\u2019ll basically be funneled: (2,4) \u2192 (2,5) \u2192 (2,6)). But look at *where* that funnel goes:\n\n- We climb **up** into the more open mid-top: from (2,6) we\u2019ll have multiple outs again (toward (1,6), (3,6), (2,7)) and a ton of space.\n- We snag the apple at (2,5) along the way, narrowing the score gap.\n- We position our snake as a **vertical barrier** at x=2 above their messy structure at y=3\u20135, setting up a future box that can cut them off from the top half.\n\nCompare that to hugging the left wall and sliding into the bottom-left corner, directly under a longer snake that\u2019s already ahead on points. That\u2019s how we get **boxed**, not how we box them.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Enemy read\n\nEnemy head at (4,1) can go:\n\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,0) for an apple  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,1) for an apple  \n- UP \u2192 (4,2) for space\n\nNo line from any of those lands them on our chosen square (2,4) this turn, and none of their next logical moves create an immediate head-on with our forced follow-up to (2,5). So RIGHT is not walking into a surprise double-KO.\n\n---\n\n### Long-term note to future me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- Commit to the **RIGHT \u2192 UP \u2192 UP** ladder into the mid-top, then fan out around y=6\u20137.\n- Use our growing body as a **vertical wall** around x=1\u20133 to claim the entire upper-left/mid for ourselves.\n- Let the enemy farm the bottom apples; once we own the top, start curling a long arc down from above to squeeze them into the bottom-right quadrant.\n- Avoid any symmetric head-on until we\u2019ve closed the apple gap; our kill condition is **them slamming into our wall**, not trading heads.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy is a big coil across the bottom and mid, head at (6,1). Apples everywhere, but remember: position > fruit. We\u2019re down 9\u201314, so a suicidal trade is an instant L.\n\nCheck every move from (2,5):\n\n1) LEFT \u2192 (1,5)  \n   That\u2019s our own body. Instant self-bonk. Illegal.\n\n2) DOWN \u2192 (2,4)  \n   That\u2019s literally our neck. Moving backwards is straight death. Illegal.\n\n3) RIGHT \u2192 (3,5)  \n   That\u2019s enemy body. Running head-first into his side just hands him the game. Illegal.\n\n4) UP \u2192 (2,6)  \n   Empty square. No bodies, on-board, no apple, and zero chance of a head-on this turn because enemy head is way down at (6,1) and can\u2019t teleport.\n\nSo from the rules: we must eliminate any move that kills us immediately. That leaves exactly one legal, non-throwing move: UP.\n\nNow, does UP also keep our future options open?\n\nIf we go UP to (2,6):\n\n- Our new body next turn:  \n  (2,6) head, then (2,5), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8) tail  \n  We didn\u2019t eat, so the old tail (1,7) disappears, slightly freeing the upper-left.\n\n- From (2,6), our next-step neighbors will be:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (1,6): currently empty and stays empty (our tail is leaving (1,7), not (1,6)).  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (3,6): empty open field in the upper-center.  \n  - UP \u2192 (2,7): empty, gives us more vertical control.  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (2,5): will be our own body, so that\u2019s the only blocked direction.\n\nSo UP not only keeps us alive, it gives us three safe-looking lanes for the next turn and lifts us into the high ground where we can start wrapping over the top of the enemy.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy from (6,1) is busy choosing between going UP into open space or RIGHT onto an apple at (7,1). Either way, they stay confined to the lower band while we start controlling the upper lanes. No immediate way for them to interact with (2,6) this turn, so no secret head-on traps hiding here.\n\n---\n\nPlan for the next few turns (future me, pay attention):\n\n- Climb in the upper band (around y=6\u20138) and extend horizontally toward the center and right, using our body to form a thick wall above the enemy.  \n- Avoid drifting too far into tight corners; always keep at least two safe exits.  \n- Once we\u2019ve got a long body spanning across the board above them, look to swing down from the right side and start closing a \u201cC\u201d around them \u2013 top and side coverage, forcing them into narrower paths.  \n- Do *not* take head-on collisions while we\u2019re behind in apples unless we can guarantee they die and we survive. Priority: boxing them into our walls and letting them run out of space.\n\nUP",

But what happens next turn?\n\nIf we move to (1,6), our body becomes:  \n(1,6) \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 (2,5) \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 (1,5) \u2192 (0,5) \u2192 (0,6) \u2192 (0,7) \u2192 (0,8)\n\nFrom new head (1,6), neighbors:\n- UP: (1,7) = empty \u2705  \n- DOWN: (1,5) = our body \u274c  \n- LEFT: (0,6) = our body \u274c  \n- RIGHT: (2,6) = our body (neck) \u274c  \n\nSo we\u2019d have **only one safe move (UP)** next turn. Why cram ourselves into a chokepoint when we\u2019ve got the whole top half of the map to dominate? That\u2019s how you get boxed in, not how you box *them* in.  \n\u2192 **Technically safe this turn, strategically bad.**\n\n**3\ufe0f\u20e3 RIGHT \u2192 (3,6)**  \n(3,6) is empty.

Only 2 exits vs an aggressive rival below us? Pretty risky in future scrambles.\n\n**4\ufe0f\u20e3 UP \u2192 (2,7)**  \n(2,7) is empty.

Exactly the kind of flexible, spacious position we want for long-term boxing.\n\n---\n\nNow, what\u2019s the enemy up to? \ud83d\udc40  \n\nEnemy head: (7,1).

Zero chance of a surprise head-on near us at y=6\u20137. So we don\u2019t need to play scared this move, just smart.\n\nScore check:  \n- Us: 9  \n- Them: 15  \n\nIf we double-KO right now, they win on apples. So we **never** want a head-on trade yet. Our win condition is: get huge, build a wall, and choke them out.\n\nUP keeps us:\n- Far from immediate head-on risk  \n- In control of the upper lanes  \n- With multiple exits next turn  \n- In range of a fat apple line at (3,7), (5,7), (7,7), plus (4,6) below\n\nRIGHT and LEFT both reduce our future flexibility; UP maximizes it.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **PLAN FOR FUTURE ME (DO NOT THROW THIS, BRO):**\n\n- Use **UP now** to anchor ourselves around y=7\u20138 in the top half.  \n- Next few turns, favor moving **RIGHT along y=7/8**, scooping apples while extending a horizontal body wall across the board above the enemy.  \n- Keep at least **two safe exits** available each turn; avoid hugging our own left-side cluster too tightly.  \n- Once our body stretches far right, start looking for a **wrap-around from the top-right downwards**, so we threaten to seal them in from above and from the right, forcing them into narrower corridors.  \n- Absolutely **avoid head-on collisions** until we\u2019ve closed the apple gap; aim to make them run out of space and slam into our body instead.\n\nUP",

We\u2019re not here to play scared; we\u2019re here to scale and suffocate them.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd2e Short-term game plan for Future Me\n\n- Use this **RIGHT** to start carving a **horizontal snake** across the upper-middle (y\u22487\u20138), grabbing apples while staying above the enemy\u2019s whole formation.\n- After we extend a bit, look to **dip down selectively** (e.g. toward that (4,6) apple) only when it doesn\u2019t cut our own options.\n- Aim to form a **thick ceiling** over the enemy\u2019s zone, then later curl down from the right side to start closing their escape routes.\n- Avoid any suicidal head-on trades while we\u2019re still behind on apples; force them to run out of safe squares and smash into our body instead.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Alright chat, we\u2019re back on the board at **(3,7)**, enemy chilling down at **(9,1)**. We\u2019re still smaller on apples (10 vs 16), so we CANNOT take dumb trades. We need space, apples, and long-term control.\n\nLet\u2019s run the options:\n\n---\n\n### 1) Check all four moves\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (2,7)**  \nThat\u2019s literally the segment right behind our head. Direct backward into our own body = instant death.  \n\u2192 **Illegal. Gone.**\n\n---\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (3,6)**  \n- Cell (3,6) is currently empty. No self-hit, no enemy body there.  \n- But look at the neighborhood after we move:\n  - Above: (3,7) = our body  \n  - Left: (2,6) = our body  \n  - Below: (3,5) = enemy body and it\u2019s not their tail, so it won\u2019t go away next turn  \n  - Right: (4,6) = apple  \n\nSo if we go DOWN, next turn we\u2019re basically **forced** to go RIGHT to that apple at (4,6). It\u2019s playable, but it tunnels us downward toward the enemy\u2019s wall at y=5 and limits flexibility. Do we really want to leave the wide-open top to go fight in the cramped middle while we\u2019re behind on length? Not yet.\n\n---\n\n**UP \u2192 (3,8)**  \n- (3,8) is empty, totally safe.  \n- After this move, from (3,8) you have:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (2,8) apple  \n  - UP \u2192 (3,9) empty  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (4,8) empty  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (3,7) our body  \n\nThat\u2019s **three safe exits** plus an apple next turn at (2,8). Very cozy, very safe, keeps us in the top zone away from the enemy. Good move, but there\u2019s an even more aggressive line.\n\n---\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (4,7)**  \n- (4,7) is empty, so safe this turn.  \n- After moving RIGHT (no apple), tail at (0,8) comes off; our body stays mostly the same cluster on the left.  \n- From new head (4,7), look at the follow-up options:\n  - UP \u2192 (4,8) empty  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (4,6) apple  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (5,7) apple  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (3,7) our body  \n\nThat\u2019s **three safe exits** and **two immediate apples** in range next turn. Also, this pushes us:\n- Further into the **top-center** of the board  \n- On track to stretch a horizontal bar across the top, which is exactly how we start boxing the enemy underneath us\n\nThis is safe now and sets up a huge farm turn next.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Enemy collision check\n\nEnemy head at **(9,1)** can only go:\n- UP \u2192 (9,2) (apple)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,0)\n\nEither way, they stay deep bottom-right. There is **no way** for them to contest any of our candidate squares (3,8), (3,6), or (4,7) this turn. So we don\u2019t have to worry about head-on collisions on this move.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Strategic choice\n\nWe want:\n- Safe survival (we can\u2019t win if we\u2019re dead)\n- Multiple future options\n- Strong access to apples so we can close the 10\u201316 gap\n- Positioning to eventually **span the top** and then drop down on them from the right\n\nComparing the safe moves:\n- **DOWN**: funnels us into a tight channel near their wall. Too early to brawl in the middle.  \n- **UP**: very safe, one apple lined up, but a bit passive compared to the payoff we get on the right lane.  \n- **RIGHT**: safe now, three exits, double-apple threat next turn, and advances our plan to control the top center and then swing toward the right edge.\n\nWe play for domination, not for timid survival. So we take the aggressive but still safe expansion.\n\n---\n\n### Short-term plan for Future Me\n\n- From **(4,7)**, strongly favor:\n  - RIGHT to grab **(5,7)**, then continue building a horizontal line toward x=7\u20138, OR  \n  - DOWN to **(4,6)** if that line is safer next turn.\n- Try to form a thick **top bar** along y=7\u20138 with our body.\n- Once we\u2019re comfortably long and up on space, start wrapping from the **top-right downwards**, aiming to trap the enemy into the lower-right quadrant where they eventually run out of squares and have to crash into us.\n\nRIGHT",

Midline at **y = 5** is almost a full wall of snake bodies, with a choke toward the **right side** around x = 6\u20139 where both snakes can move between top and bottom. That choke is the key to boxing them in later.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four directions from (4,7)\n\n### LEFT \u2192 (3,7)\nThat\u2019s our own neck. Moving directly backward is illegal = instant death.  \n\u2192 **Throw it out.**\n\n### UP \u2192 (4,8)\n- (4,8) is empty. Safe this turn.\n- No snake can reach it this turn from where they are; enemy is far at (9,2).\n- After moving here (no apple), our new body would be:\n  - Head: (4,8)\n  - Body: (4,7),(3,7),(2,7),(2,6),(2,5),(2,4),(1,4),(1,5),(0,5),(0,6)\n- Next-turn options from (4,8):\n  - LEFT \u2192 (3,8) empty\n  - UP \u2192 (4,9) empty\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (5,8) empty\n  - DOWN \u2192 (4,7) is our own neck, so illegal\n  \u2192 **3 good exits, safe, keeps us high.** But no apple this move.\n\n### DOWN \u2192 (4,6)\n- (4,6) is an apple. Safe to move onto (no body there).\n- We\u2019d **grow**, tail at (0,7) stays this turn.\n- New body:\n  - Head: (4,6)\n  - Then: (4,7),(3,7),(2,7),(2,6),(2,5),(2,4),(1,4),(1,5),(0,5),(0,6),(0,7)\n\nNext turn from (4,6):\n- UP \u2192 (4,7) is neck (backwards) \u2192 illegal\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,5) is enemy body and **not** their tail \u2192 guaranteed death\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,6) empty\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,6) empty  \n\u2192 Only **2 safe exits**, and we\u2019ve just dropped down closer to their thick mid-wall at y=5.\n\nStrategically?\n- Yes, we get an apple.\n- But we step closer to their mass and lose an option (UP is gone, DOWN is suicide).\n- Easier to get squeezed later as they work upward on the right.\n\n### RIGHT \u2192 (5,7)\n- (5,7) is an apple. No snake body there. Legal and tasty.\n- We **grow**, tail at (0,7) stays this turn.\n- New body:\n  - Head: (5,7)\n  - Then: (4,7),(3,7),(2,7),(2,6),(2,5),(2,4),(1,4),(1,5),(0,5),(0,6),(0,7)\n\nNext turn from (5,7):\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,7) is neck \u2192 illegal (backwards)\n- UP \u2192 (5,8) empty\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,7) empty\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,6) empty  \n\u2192 **3 good exits**, we stay in the top band, and we grab an apple immediately.\n\nPositionally, this moves us:\n- Toward **center-right top**, directly on the path to:\n  - Apple at **(7,7)** a couple steps away\n  - The critical vertical choke around columns 6\u20138 where enemy will try to break into the top\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Enemy movement and collision risk\n\nEnemy head at **(9,2)**:\n\nPossible moves:\n- UP \u2192 (9,3) empty\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,2) empty\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,1) is their neck \u2192 illegal\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10,2) off-board \u2192 illegal\n\nSo they can only go to (9,3) or (8,2).  \nNone of our candidate moves (4,8), (4,6), (5,7) overlap any of those, so **no head-on collision** this turn no matter what they do.\n\nThey\u2019re still stuck in the **bottom-right**, and any path to the top half goes roughly through:\n- (8,3) \u2192 (8,4) \u2192 (8,5) \u2192 up/right-side corridor.\n\nIf we push our head and body across the **top center toward the right**, we can claim that choke before they arrive and later force them into a cramped box below.\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategic comparison\n\nWe\u2019re down **10 vs 17 apples**. Double-KO right now loses us the game, so we want:\n- Guaranteed survival\n- Apples to close the gap\n- Control over the **top-right choke** so we can eventually box them in\n\nCompare the safe options:\n\n- **UP (4,8)**  \n  - Very safe, 3 exits, stays far from the enemy.  \n  - But we skip an immediate apple and let them keep expanding uncontested while we play too passive.\n\n- **DOWN (4,6)**  \n  - Gets an apple, but pulls us nearer to their mid-wall.  \n  - Only 2 safe exits, and one adjacent cell is permanent enemy body at (4,5).  \n  - Increases risk of getting squeezed from below as they move up on the right.\n\n- **RIGHT (5,7)**  \n  - Safe this turn, 3 exits next turn.  \n  - Grabs an apple instantly to reduce the score gap.  \n  - Keeps us on **row 7**, firmly in the top band.  \n  - Lines us up to push further right toward:\n    - Apple at (7,7),\n    - Control over columns 6\u20138 above their mid-wall,\n    - The eventual wrap that can cage them in the bottom-right.\n\nThis is the perfect mix of aggression and safety: we grow, we stay high, we head straight toward the decisive area of the board.\n\n---\n\n## 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Short-term plan for Future Me\n\n- From **(5,7)** next turn, strongly consider:\n  - **RIGHT** toward (6,7) then (7,7) to keep stretching a horizontal bar across the top, or  \n  - **UP** to thicken the top band if enemy races the choke faster than expected.\n- Aim to claim the **top-right corridor** above x \u2248 6\u20138 so the enemy\u2019s only exits upward are into our body.\n- Keep farming top and right-side apples while staying clear of the crowded midline around y=5 until we\u2019re long enough to threaten a winning head-on collision.\n\nRIGHT",

That\u2019s the fight we care about.\n\nCrucial: None of our candidate moves \u2014 (5,8), (5,6), or (6,7) \u2014 overlap **(9,4)** or **(8,3)**, so:\n- No head-on collision risk this turn.\n- We also can\u2019t bait them into crashing into us yet.\n\nSince they\u2019re at **17 apples vs our 11**, any double-KO **loses us the game** right now. We avoid that, we grow, then we hunt them later. \ud83d\udc80\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategic choice\n\nCompare the safe moves:\n\n- **UP** \u2192 Maximum safety, but ultra passive. We abandon the contested right-side space and let them farm the rich apple cluster uncontested. That just makes their lead bigger. Lane diff vibes. \ud83d\ude12\n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 Gives us easy apple at (4,6) next turn, but:\n  - Pulls us closer to their mid-wall.\n  - Starts playing in THEIR layer (y\u22485\u20136) instead of enforcing a **roof** over them.\n  - More risk of getting tangled when they surge up later.\n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192  \n  - Keeps us in the safer **top band**.  \n  - Lines us up to **snap up (7,7)** next turn.  \n  - Pushes our control toward the **top-right choke** where they must pass if they want to escape the bottom.  \n  - Still keeps lots of follow-up options and distance from immediate danger.\n\nWe want to **own the top-right corridor** and slowly build a ceiling over them while we farm apples. RIGHT is the best move for that plan.\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Note to Future Me \ud83c\udfaf\n\n- From **(6,7)**, strongly eye **RIGHT to (7,7)** next turn to secure that high-value apple and extend our horizontal wall.\n- Keep stretching across the **top rows (y=7\u20138)** toward the right edge while watching their climb up via x=8\u20139.\n- Goal: turn our snake into a **horizontal roof**, then drop a vertical pillar somewhere on the right to fence them into the lower box.\n- Avoid early head-on trades until we\u2019ve narrowed the apple gap or set up a position where they\u2019re forced to ram into our body.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy is **(9,4)** with a long ladder up the right side and a fat bottom wall. Score: **us 11**, them **17**. If we trade heads now, we LOSE on apples. So no YOLO head-on yet\u2026 we farm and **set the trap** \ud83d\ude0f\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from (6,7)\n\nNeighbors:\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,7)**  \n  - That\u2019s literally our own neck. Instant self-bonk \ud83d\udc80  \n  - Illegal. Toss it.\n\n- **UP \u2192 (6,8)**  \n  - Currently empty. \u2705  \n  - No apple.  \n  - New shape: we stay above our existing horizontal wall at y=7.  \n  - Next turn options from (6,8):  \n    - LEFT \u2192 (5,8) empty  \n    - RIGHT \u2192 (7,8) empty  \n    - UP \u2192 (6,9) empty  \n  - So we keep **3 exits**, super safe, and still control the top band.  \n  - We can still grab that sweet \ud83c\udf4e at **(7,7)** later (path: 6,8 \u2192 7,8 \u2192 7,7). Enemy is 5+ moves away from it, so no rush.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,6)**  \n  - Cell is empty. \u2705  \n  - No apple. Tail likely slides from (0,6) to (0,5).  \n  - From (6,6) next turn:  \n    - LEFT \u2192 (5,6) empty  \n    - RIGHT \u2192 (7,6) empty  \n    - DOWN \u2192 (6,5) empty  \n  - Also **3 exits**, and we drift toward the apple cluster around (4,6), (6,4), (7,5), (8,5).  \n  - BUT this drags us **down toward enemy territory** (their head at 9,4). That\u2019s where they\u2019re strong and where messy scrambles can force head-on situations we currently lose. Risky vibes \ud83e\udd28\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7,7)**  \n  - That\u2019s an **apple** \ud83c\udf4e and an empty cell. \u2705  \n  - We **grow** and go to **12 apples**. Tail at (0,6) stays put this turn. Longer snake = more wall, more box potential \ud83d\udcaa  \n  - From (7,7) next turn:  \n    - UP \u2192 (7,8) empty  \n    - RIGHT \u2192 (8,7) empty  \n    - DOWN \u2192 (7,6) empty  \n  - Again **3 exits**, plus we extend our **horizontal roof** across y=7 deeper into the right side.\n\nSo safe moves: **UP, DOWN, RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What can the enemy do?\n\nEnemy head: **(9,4)**.\n\nLegal moves for them:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (9,5)** (empty) \u2705  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (8,4)** (apple) \u2705  \n- DOWN = their neck, RIGHT = off board \u274c\n\nSo they\u2019re either going to **(9,5)** or **(8,4)**. Both keep them in the **right-mid** zone (y=4\u20135), with easy access to the huge apple cluster at (8,4), (8,5), (7,5), (7,3), (5,3), etc.\n\nNow check for **immediate collision risk**:\n\n- Our candidates: (6,8), (6,6), (7,7)  \n- Their candidates: (9,5), (8,4)\n\nNo overlap at all. So:\n- No head-on this turn \u2705  \n- No way they ram our body this turn either \u2705  \n\nWe\u2019re safe on all three directions this move.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategy: board control & boxing plan\n\nWe\u2019re **behind 11\u201317**, so:\n- Forcing head-on now = **game over in their favor** \u274c  \n- We need to **grow** and **dominate space**, then eventually trap them so they die *into our body*, not via head trade.\n\nWhat\u2019s our shape right now?\n\n- We have a **big horizontal bar** along y=7 from x=2 \u2192 6.  \n- We have a vertical column down at x=2 and a chunky left mass around x=0\u20132, y=4\u20136.  \n- They have a solid bottom wall on y=1 and a right-side ladder around x=9 and the central column cluster at x=1\u20133, y=2\u20135.\n\nThe long-term win condition? \ud83d\udea8  \nTurn our snake into a **massive roof + right-side wall** that boxes them into a shrinking cage in the **bottom-right**. We want:\n- Horizontal control on **top rows (y=7\u20139)** across toward x\u22488\u20139.\n- Then a drop **down the right edge** to seal them.\n\nWhich move helps that most?\n\n- **DOWN**:  \n  - Drags us toward their current head.  \n  - Makes future messy fights likely in the same band y=4\u20136 while they\u2019re longer.  \n  - Not ideal while behind on apples.\n\n- **UP**:  \n  - Very safe, keeps top control, but **ignores a free apple** right next to us and delays growth.  \n  - Still fine, but a bit passive while they\u2019re about to farm a gold mine on the right.\n\n- **RIGHT (to 7,7)**:  \n  - Instant apple \u2192 **+1 length, +1 score (12)**.  \n  - Extends our **horizontal roof** across more of row 7 towards the right.  \n  - Sets us up next to **7,8** and **8,7** for continued expansion into the top-right corridor.  \n  - Enemy is still stuck at y=4\u20135; they can\u2019t challenge this upper band for several moves.\n\nWe get **growth + territory** in one move, with no extra risk this turn. That\u2019s exactly how we start **building the box** around them \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Note to future me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- From **(7,7)**, lean into expanding **UP and RIGHT**: aim to take over **row 8** and push toward **x=8\u20139**.  \n- Watch enemy climbs from around **(8,5)/(9,5)** upward; we want to stay **above and slightly left**, forming a ceiling they can\u2019t cross.  \n- Avoid diving down into the mid-right scrum too early; let our snake become a huge upper net first.  \n- Keep looking for chances to let them walk into our body from below instead of trading heads \u2014 we only go for head-on once we\u2019re **ahead on apples** or they\u2019re in a forced corridor.\n\nRIGHT",

They win the tiebreak.\n\nOur body: big horizontal bar at **y=7 (x=2\u21927)** plus mass on the left.  \nEnemy body: fat bottom wall and a column up the right/mid.\n\nWe\u2019re trying to build the **roof** and then close the **right-side door** to box them in the bottom-right. Let\u2019s check moves.\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from (7,7)\n\nNeighbors:\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,7)**  \n  - That\u2019s our own neck. Direct backward move = instant self-elim \ud83d\udc80  \n  - **ILLEGAL.** Toss it.\n\n- **UP \u2192 (7,8)**  \n  - Board: empty, no apple. \u2705  \n  - After move (no apple) tail at (0,6) disappears, new tail becomes (0,5).  \n  - Next-turn options from (7,8):  \n    - UP \u2192 (7,9) empty  \n    - LEFT \u2192 (6,8) empty  \n    - RIGHT \u2192 (8,8) empty  \n  - So **3 exits** and we stay high.  \n  - BUT: We leave **(8,7)** open. Enemy can soon climb up the center-right and punch through that gap, breaking our future \u201croof\u201d.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,6)**  \n  - Board shows (7,6) empty. \u2705  \n  - No apple \u2192 tail moves up from (0,6) to (0,5).  \n  - Next-turn options from (7,6):  \n    - DOWN \u2192 (7,5) (apple)  \n    - LEFT \u2192 (6,6) empty  \n    - RIGHT \u2192 (8,6) empty  \n  - Again **3 exits**.  \n  - But this drags us **toward** the enemy (they\u2019re at 8,4 and likely going up to 8,5/8,6/7,5).  \n  - We\u2019re **shorter**. Fighting them in that tight mid-right band risks a forced head-on we **lose** on score. Not worth it yet.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,7)**  \n  - Board: (8,7) is empty, no apple. \u2705  \n  - After move: tail (0,6) disappears, tail becomes (0,5).  \n  - Row 7 then is basically our wall from **x=2\u21928**:  \n    - Head at (8,7), body at (7,7),(6,7),(5,7),(4,7),(3,7),(2,7).  \n  - Next-turn options from (8,7):  \n    - UP \u2192 (8,8) empty  \n    - DOWN \u2192 (8,6) empty  \n    - RIGHT \u2192 (9,7) **apple** \ud83e\udd24  \n  - **3 exits** and we extend our horizontal **roof** one more column into the right side.\n\nSo **safe options**: **UP, DOWN, RIGHT**. LEFT is suicide.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Where can the enemy go?\n\nEnemy head at **(8,4)**:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (8,5)**: apple, empty \u2192 very attractive \u2705  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,4)**: empty \u2705  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,3)**: empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT is its own neck (9,4) \u2192 illegal \u274c\n\nSo their candidates this turn: **(8,5)**, **(7,4)**, **(8,3)**.\n\nCheck for immediate head-on with our candidates:\n\n- Our: (7,8), (7,6), (8,7)  \n- Theirs: (8,5), (7,4), (8,3)\n\nNo overlap. No head-on this turn, no body-hit either. All three of our options are tactically safe **this** move.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term strategy: build the CAGE \ud83e\udde0\n\nWe\u2019re down **12\u201318**. Our win condition is:\n\n- **Grow** and become a huge wall.\n- Turn row **7/8** into a **ceiling** across the board.\n- Then **drop down the right edge** and box them into the bottom-right.\n- Eventually, force them to run into **our body**, NOT a head trade.\n\nTo do that, we must **deny them the vertical escape lanes** at x=8 and x=9.\n\nCompare our moves under that lens:\n\n### UP to (7,8)\nLooks safe, but leaves (8,7) open.  \nWhat happens if we go UP while they go UP to (8,5), then (8,6)?\n\n- Turn 29: Us (7,8), Them (8,5)\n- Turn 30: If we go RIGHT \u2192 (8,8); Them UP \u2192 (8,6)\n- Now **(8,7)** is still open.  \n- Next turn, if:\n  - We try to drop to (8,7), they can also go UP from (8,6) to (8,7) \u2192 **head-on**.  \n  - They\u2019re ahead on apples \u2192 they **win** the double KO.\n- Since we **can\u2019t safely contest (8,7)**, they can eventually climb through that column and invade the top. Our roof plan collapses.\n\nSo UP is **too passive**; it gives them a hole to slip through.\n\n### DOWN to (7,6)\nMore aggressive into the center, closer to the apple cluster\u2026 but right into their sphere of control.\n\n- They\u2019re about to farm (8,5), (7,5), (6,4), etc.\n- We\u2019re shorter, and the geometry down there is tight with both bodies.\n- That\u2019s exactly where a clever opponent will try to set up a head-on that **they** like (because of the score lead).\n\nDOWN = more chaos, but chaos currently **favors them**, not us.\n\n### RIGHT to (8,7) \ud83d\ude08\nThis is the money move.\n\n- Immediately extends our horizontal bar on **row 7** into column 8.\n- Very next turn we can likely go **RIGHT again to (9,7)** for that apple, giving us:\n  - A **full roof from x=2\u21929 on row 7**, plus\n  - A juicy growth spurt to keep length advantage in space control.\n- While we\u2019re doing that, their typical line is:\n  - (8,4) \u2192 (8,5) \u2192 (8,6), climbing **under** our emerging roof.\n- From there:\n  - If they try to go **UP into (8,7)**, they slam into our body and die. We win.\n  - If they go sideways (7,6 or 9,6), we stay above, expand along row 8/9, and tighten the box.\n\nCrucially: with the RIGHT-first plan, we **own (8,7)** immediately. That cell becomes **deadly** for them to step into. They lose the clean ladder to the top. Exactly what we want.\n\nStrategically:  \n**RIGHT now** \u2192 **RIGHT to the apple next** \u2192 then **UP** along the top edge gives us a gigantic lid over their entire position.\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Note to future me \ud83d\udcdd\n\n- Prioritize finishing the **roof**: after moving RIGHT now, strongly consider:\n  - Next: **RIGHT \u2192 (9,7)** to grab that apple and fill the last top-right gap.\n  - Then: **UP** from the edge and sweep along **row 8 or 9** to extend our ceiling.\n- Avoid dropping **down** near them until:\n  - We have a clear length/score advantage **or**\n  - We can force them into a corridor where any move they make hits our body.\n- Watch for their head clustering around **(8,6)/(9,6)**. From our top-right perch, never pick a move that lets them choose a **winning head-on tie-break** square with us.\n- Goal over the next ~5\u20138 turns:  \n  - Turn top and right edges into **our territory**,  \n  - Squeeze their movement into a shrinking box below y=6, then below y=5.\n\nright",

Let\u2019s break it down clean and lethal.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Current situation\n\n- Our head: **(8,7)**  \n- Our body: big horizontal wall at **y = 7, x = 2\u21928**, plus a column/cluster on the left.\n- Enemy head: **(8,5)**  \n- Enemy body: thick band along bottom and right, tail at **(3,5)**.\n- Scores: **Us 12**, **Them 19** \u2192 they win any double-KO right now. No head-on gambles.\n\nWe need to:\n- Stay alive.\n- Avoid any square the enemy can contest with their head this turn.\n- Keep building the \u201croof\u201d and grab apples where it doesn\u2019t risk a trade.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four of our moves from (8,7)\n\nPossible moves:\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,7)**  \n  - That\u2019s our own neck (previous head). Direct backward = immediate death.  \n  - **Illegal / losing.**\n\n- **UP \u2192 (8,8)**  \n  - Board at (8,8) is empty. No apple.  \n  - Not our body, not enemy body.  \n  - No way enemy gets there in one move from (8,5).  \n  - **Safe this turn.**\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,6)**  \n  - Board shows (8,6) empty.  \n  - But enemy head at (8,5) has a legal move **UP \u2192 (8,6)** too.  \n  - If we go DOWN while they go UP:\n    - Both heads meet at **(8,6)** \u2192 double KO.\n    - They\u2019re ahead **19 vs 12** \u2192 they win the game on that trade.\n  - A rational opponent is happy to take this.  \n  - **DOWN is effectively suicide. Toss it.**\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9,7)**  \n  - (9,7) has an **apple**, no snake segments.  \n  - We move there, eat, grow. Tail at (0,5) does **not** move.  \n  - Enemy from (8,5) can move to:\n    - UP \u2192 (8,6)\n    - LEFT \u2192 (7,5)\n    - RIGHT \u2192 (9,5)\n  - None of those is (9,7) \u2192 no head-on collision.  \n  - **Safe this turn and gives us +1 apple.**\n\nSo immediate filter:\n- **LEFT**: illegal (backwards).\n- **DOWN**: losing via potential head-on at (8,6).\n- **UP, RIGHT**: both safe now.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Enemy options and how they interact\n\nEnemy from **(8,5)** can go:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (8,6)** (empty)\n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,5)** (apple)\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9,5)** (empty)\n\nWe must assume they\u2019ll pick whichever is best _for them_, including taking a winning double-KO. That\u2019s why we already nuked **DOWN** from consideration.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at our two safe candidates in more depth.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 If we go UP \u2192 (8,8)\n\n- We don\u2019t grow; tail at (0,5) disappears, new tail becomes (1,5).\n- Our shape:\n  - Head at (8,8),\n  - Roof along **y = 7** from **x = 2\u21928**,\n  - Left cluster at x=0\u20132, y=4\u20136.\n\nCheck vs enemy replies:\n\n- Enemy UP \u2192 (8,6):  \n  - Their head at (8,6), ours at (8,8): fine, no collision.\n  - Next turn we have 3 decent moves: UP(8,9), LEFT(7,8), RIGHT(9,8).  \n  - They\u2019re still underneath us; our roof mostly intact but **(9,7) apple remains unclaimed**.\n\n- Enemy LEFT \u2192 (7,5) (they eat an apple):  \n  - Still no contact. They grow again, extending their lead.\n  - We gained nothing this turn; they got stronger.\n\n- Enemy RIGHT \u2192 (9,5):  \n  - Again, we\u2019re just floating, no apple. They reposition toward the right.\n\nSo UP is **safe**, but:\n- We gain **no apple**.\n- Enemy might gain an apple if they go LEFT.\n- Our horizontal \u201croof\u201d stops at x=8; **x=9 on row 7 is still open**.\n\n---\n\n### 5\ufe0f\u20e3 If we go RIGHT \u2192 (9,7) [apple]\n\nWe eat the apple at (9,7). After the move:\n\n- Our new head: **(9,7)**\n- We grow: tail at (0,5) stays this turn.\n- Our row-7 wall is now **x = 2\u21929**, completely sealing that row from the enemy\u2019s side.\n\nConsider enemy answers:\n\n#### a) Enemy UP \u2192 (8,6)\n\n- Heads: us (9,7), them (8,6). No collision.\n- Next turn:\n  - Our legal moves from (9,7):  \n    - UP \u2192 (9,8)  \n    - DOWN \u2192 (9,6) (but risky)\n  - Their moves from (8,6):  \n    - 7,6 or 9,6 (8,7 is our body = suicide for them).\n  - If we ever go DOWN \u2192 (9,6) while they go RIGHT \u2192 (9,6), that\u2019s a head-on they **win**.  \n  - So we simply avoid DOWN and go **UP to (9,8)**.\n- Net: we\u2019re not trapped; we just choose UP as safe path and stay above them.\n\n#### b) Enemy LEFT \u2192 (7,5) (eats apple)\n\n- We\u2019re at (9,7), they\u2019re at (7,5). No clash.\n- They grow, tail stays at (3,5).\n- Next turn:\n  - Our options: UP(9,8), DOWN(9,6) safely (they can\u2019t reach either in one step).\n  - Their options from (7,5): 7,6 / 7,4 / 6,5 / 8,5 \u2013 none conflict with 9,8 or 9,6.\n- We\u2019ve got at least two safe moves and a full roof from 2\u21929.\n\n#### c) Enemy RIGHT \u2192 (9,5)\n\n- Positions: us (9,7), them (9,5).\n- Next turn we again have UP(9,8) or DOWN(9,6).\n- If we go DOWN \u2192 (9,6) and they go UP \u2192 (9,6), that\u2019s a losing head-on.  \n  \u2192 So we commit to **UP** if they\u2019re on that column.\n- UP to (9,8) is safe; top is very open.\n\nIn all enemy branches:\n- RIGHT is **safe this turn**.\n- We always have at least one safe continuation (usually two).\n- We secure a **free apple** and extend our roof all the way to the right wall.\n\n---\n\n### 6\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategic comparison: UP vs RIGHT\n\n- We\u2019re behind on apples: **12 vs 19**.  \n  - Any safe apple is gold; RIGHT gets us one immediately.\n- Our long-term win condition is **board control**, not a head-on coinflip we currently lose:\n  - Build and maintain a **roof** that boxes the opponent into the lower half.\n  - Then slowly wrap around from the right/top to squeeze them.\n- RIGHT:\n  - Completes the **row-7 horizontal wall** from x=2 to x=9.\n  - Keeps the enemy stuck under that wall; they cannot pass through row 7 at x\u22652 without slamming our body.\n  - Puts us in perfect position to go **UP next turn** and start building a second layer along row 8/9.\n  - Gains us an apple safely.\n\n- UP:\n  - Leaves (9,7) apple untouched.\n  - Leaves the rightmost part of the roof incomplete.\n  - Lets the enemy grow while we don\u2019t, if they choose LEFT.\n\nGiven we must both:\n- Avoid losing head-on trades while behind, and\n- Grow and strengthen our wall,\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (9,7)** is clearly the better, more aggressive, and still safe play.\n\n---\n\n### 7\ufe0f\u20e3 Note to future self\n\n- After moving **RIGHT \u2192 (9,7)** and eating, strongly favor:\n  - **UP from (9,7)** next turn if the enemy is anywhere that can contest (9,6). Don\u2019t give them a winning head-on square.\n  - From there, start sweeping along **row 8 or row 9** to the left, adding a second \u201cceiling\u201d above our row-7 wall.\n- Keep that horizontal barrier at y=7 intact; don\u2019t create gaps that let their head sneak above.\n- Only consider intentional head-on plays later if we\u2019ve **closed the apple gap** significantly and can trade winningly.\n\nRIGHT",

We stay on top, literally.\n\n### If enemy goes LEFT \u2192 (7,6)\n- They maybe eat the apple at (7,5) next, or slide around.\n- Again, they can\u2019t reach **(9,8)** or **(9,9)** in a single step.\n- We\u2019ll have **multiple safe options** from the top.\n\nSo UP is not just \u201cnot losing now\u201d \u2014 it **keeps future options open** and preserves our high ground above the huge y=7 wall we built. We keep the \u201croof\u201d and start building a second layer up top \ud83d\ude0f\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term plan (note to future self \ud83e\udde0)\n\n- From **(9,8)**, prioritize staying **above** the opponent:\n  - Likely go **UP to (9,9)**, then start sliding **left** along the top rows (9/8) to grab safe apples like **(4,8), (2,8), (1,8), (0,9)**.\n- Maintain that **row-7 wall** from x=2\u20139; don\u2019t open gaps that let their head climb above us.\n- Avoid any move that creates a **contested square** with their head \u2014 they\u2019re still ahead on score and will happily take a double-KO.\n- Use our length and \u201croof\u201d to slowly box them into the lower-right/bottom area and force them into our body later when we\u2019ve closed the score gap.\n\nWe survive this turn, stay on the high ground, and keep scaling for the late-game squeeze.

Also, the apple at **(9,9)** is effectively \u201creserved\u201d for us \u2013 enemy can *never* get top-right through our y=7 wall before we choose to move there. \ud83c\udf4e\n\n### If we go LEFT \u2192 (7,8)\n\nOur new head: **(7,8)**  \nBody: (8,8) \u2192 (9,8) \u2192 (9,7) \u2192 (8,7) \u2192 \u2026 (same big wall below).\n\nNext turn from (7,8):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (7,9)** (empty, safe) \u2705  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,8)** (empty, safe) \u2705  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,7)** = our body \u274c  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,8)** = backwards \u274c  \n\nAgain, **2 good options** (UP or LEFT).\n\nSo in terms of *raw mobility*, **UP and LEFT are equally flexible next turn**. The tiebreaker becomes **strategic position + apple timing**.\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategic vibes: how do we BOX this guy in? \ud83d\udce6\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLook at the map:\n\n- We own a **thick wall at y=7 from x=2..9**. That\u2019s a massive horizontal barrier.  \n- Enemy is stuck in the **lower-right / lower-middle** quadrant (y\u22646).  \n- Their only realistic future escape to the **upper half** is sneaking around the **far left side** (x=0\u20131) if we ever open gaps.\n\nWhat do we want?\n\n- A **huge \u201cceiling\u201d** over them on rows **8\u20139**, stretching **leftwards**.  \n- Eventually, drop a vertical column on the left to **close the cage** and suffocate their movement.  \n- While we\u2019re doing that, we can leisurely scoop the top apples they\u2019ll *never* touch.\n\nBetween the two moves:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (8,9)** keeps us more in the top-right corner, close to an apple we already basically own for free later.\n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,8)** immediately pushes our influence **further left**, extending that ceiling toward the center and left side, where the real fight for space will happen.\n\nThe apple at **(9,9)** isn\u2019t going anywhere, and enemy can\u2019t threaten it. But getting our head further left **ASAP** helps us:\n\n- Start controlling apples like **(4,8), (2,8), (1,8)** before they ever dream of escaping.  \n- Stretch the \u201croof\u201d over a wider chunk of the board, making their future routes more cramped and predictable.  \n- Keep them permanently **underneath** us, where any greedy push upward will eventually run into our body \ud83d\ude08\n\nSo which move improves long-term domination more?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **LEFT to (7,8)**: we keep the high ground *and* advance the ceiling over their side of the map. That\u2019s the real choke setup.\n\n---\n\n## 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Note to future self \ud83d\udcdd\n\n- Keep sliding **LEFT along rows 8 and 9**, building a massive roof over the whole board.  \n- Do **not** open a gap in the y=7 wall that lets them slip above us while we\u2019re still behind on apples.  \n- When we\u2019ve stretched far enough left, look for a safe moment to **drop a vertical column downward** on the left side and start closing the cage from that side.  \n- Avoid any contested squares they can reach in 1 move until we\u2019re close to or ahead in apples; they *want* the double-KO right now.\n\nLEFT",

We\u2019re still behind 13\u201320, so any double-KO is basically throwing. We box him in, we don\u2019t trade.\n\nLet\u2019s run it.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from (7,8)\n\nFrom our head (7,8):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (7,9)**\n  - On board.\n  - Board at (7,9) is `.` \u2192 empty.\n  - Not our body, not enemy.\n  - Candidate: SAFE.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,7)**\n  - That\u2019s our own body segment on the y=7 wall.\n  - Walking into our own body = instant death.\n  - DEAD.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,8)**\n  - Board at (6,8) is `.` \u2192 empty.\n  - Not our body, not enemy.\n  - Candidate: SAFE.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,8)**\n  - That\u2019s our neck, the cell directly behind us.\n  - Moving backwards is illegal / suicide.\n  - DEAD.\n\nSo only **UP** and **LEFT** survive step 1.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What can the enemy do this turn?\n\nEnemy head: **(6,5)**  \nTheir immediate neighbors:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (6,6)**  \n  - Check board: (6,6) is `.` (empty).\n  - Not their body, not ours.\n  - SAFE.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,4)**  \n  - Board at (6,4) is an apple `A`.\n  - Not a body cell.\n  - SAFE, and they grow.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,5)**  \n  - Board at (5,5) is `.`.\n  - SAFE.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7,5)**  \n  - Their own body and also backwards.\n  - Suicide; they won\u2019t choose it.\n\nSo realistic enemy moves: **(6,6), (6,4), (5,5)**.\n\nDo any of those equal our candidate moves **(7,9)** or **(6,8)**?  \nNo. So:\n\n- No head-on collision this turn regardless of **UP** vs **LEFT**.\n- We only need to care about long-term position and flexibility.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare UP vs LEFT for long-term pressure\n\n#### If we go UP \u2192 (7,9)\n\n- New head: (7,9).\n- Our y=7 wall (x=2..9) stays completely intact.\n- Next turn options from (7,9):\n  - LEFT \u2192 (6,9) (empty).\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (8,9) (empty).\n  - UP/OFF or DOWN/backwards are illegal.\n\nSo we\u2019d sit on the top row with two safe moves, but a bit farther away from the main action.\n\n#### If we go LEFT \u2192 (6,8)\n\n- New head: (6,8).\n- Our y=7 wall also stays fully intact.\n- Next turn options from (6,8):\n  - UP \u2192 (6,9) (empty).\n  - LEFT \u2192 (5,8) (empty).\n  - DOWN into wall or RIGHT backwards are illegal.\n\nAgain, two safe moves. But now our head is pushing **left across row 8**, exactly the \u201cceiling\u201d we\u2019ve been building over them.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Territory and boxing plan\n\nWhat\u2019s the macro picture?\n\n- We own a huge **barrier on y=7**, x=2..9.\n- Enemy is trapped underneath that, mostly in rows 1\u20136.\n- Their only theoretical escape to the upper half is around the **far left (x=0\u20131)**, where our wall currently has gaps at y=7.\n\nOur win condition is not rushing apples; it\u2019s **using our length to claim the entire top and then drop a left-side wall** to cage them.\n\nBetween the two moves:\n\n- **UP** to (7,9) moves us a bit farther away vertically and towards the uncontested corner apples that we already effectively own; low urgency.\n- **LEFT** to (6,8) continues sliding the \u201croof\u201d over the board\u2019s center, pushing our influence **toward the left side** where their future escape routes live.\n\nWe keep the y=7 barrier solid either way, but LEFT:\n\n- Extends our presence over the central top lanes sooner.\n- Keeps us aligned with our previous plan: slide left along rows 8/9, then use that to clamp the left edge.\n- Maintains max pressure while still being 100% safe this turn.\n\nSo we take **LEFT** and keep building the ceiling over their head.\n\n---\n\n### 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Note to future self\n\n- Keep sliding **LEFT along row 8**, then pop **UP to row 9** when it keeps our options open (especially once near x3\u20134).\n- Watch the corridor around **x=0\u20131**; do not let them slither above y=6 there. When the timing is right, use our top control to swing over and eventually drop a **vertical wall** down the left side.\n- Avoid any head-on opportunities as long as they have the apple lead; instead, engineer lines where they must choose between:\n  - Crashing their head into our body, or\n  - Retreating into tighter space below our wall.\n\nLEFT",

Box him, don\u2019t bonk.\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from (6,8)\n\nNeighbors:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (6,9)**\n  - On board.\n  - Board (6,9) is `.` (empty).\n  - Not our body, not enemy.\n  - \u2714\ufe0f SAFE.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,7)**\n  - That\u2019s **our own body** on the y=7 wall.\n  - Walking into ourselves = instant throw.\n  - \u274c DEAD.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,8)**\n  - Board (5,8) is `.` (empty).\n  - Not in our body list, not in theirs.\n  - \u2714\ufe0f SAFE.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7,8)**\n  - That\u2019s our **neck** (directly behind the head).\n  - Moving backwards is suicide.\n  - \u274c DEAD.\n\nSo only **UP** and **LEFT** survive.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What can the enemy do this turn?\n\nEnemy head at **(6,4)**:\n\nNeighbors:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (6,5)**  \n  - That\u2019s their own neck (backwards) \u21d2 suicide, ignore.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,3)**  \n  - Board (6,3) is `.` (empty). \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,4)**  \n  - Board (5,4) is `.` (empty). \u2714\ufe0f\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7,4)**  \n  - Board (7,4) is `.` (empty). \u2714\ufe0f\n\nReal enemy moves: **(6,3), (5,4), (7,4)**.  \nNone of these equal our options **(6,9)** or **(5,8)**, and they\u2019re all far below us.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **No possible head-on this turn** regardless of UP vs LEFT. So this turn is all strategy/positioning.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare UP vs LEFT (space, pressure, apples)\n\n### If we go UP \u2192 (6,9)\n\n- New head: **(6,9)** on the top row.\n- Our **y=7 wall (x=2..9)** stays intact below.\n- Next turn options from (6,9):\n  - **LEFT \u2192 (5,9)** (empty).\n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (7,9)** (empty).\n  - DOWN is backward, UP is off-board.\n- We can then slide along row 9 and drop down later into row 8.\n- Apples ahead on row 9 at **(3,9)** and **(0,9)** but they take a few moves.\n\nPros:\n- Safe, plenty of air.\n- Easy access to top-row apples eventually.\nCons:\n- Slightly slower to reach the **left-side choke** (x=0\u20131) that\u2019s their only escape above our y=7 roof.\n\n---\n\n### If we go LEFT \u2192 (5,8)\n\n- New head: **(5,8)**.\n- Body after move (no apple): we keep that full **row-7 roof** from x=2..9.\n- Next turn from (5,8):\n  - **LEFT \u2192 (4,8)**: that\u2019s an apple \ud83c\udf4e at (4,8).\n  - **UP \u2192 (5,9)**: empty on the top row.\n- DOWN is into our own body, RIGHT is backwards.\n\nSo from (5,8) we still have **two clean exits** next turn, and we\u2019re now sliding our **ceiling leftward** directly above the enemy\u2019s territory.\n\nExtra upside:\n- We\u2019re **one move away** from the apple at **(4,8)**.\n- From there we can continue LEFT along row 8 toward more apples at **(2,8) & (1,8)**, or pop UP into row 9 at any time.\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Territory + boxing plan\n\nMacro map right now:\n\n- We already control a fat **roof on y=7** from x=2..9.\n- Enemy is trapped **below** that, mostly in rows 1\u20136 on the right and center.\n- Their **only real escape** into the upper half is around **columns 0\u20131**, where our wall doesn\u2019t reach.\n\nWhat do we want?\n\n- Use our length to claim **all of the top** (rows 8\u20139).\n- Then drift **left** and eventually build a **downward wall** near x=1\u20132 to **seal the gap** so they can\u2019t ever climb above y=7.\n- Once they\u2019re caged in a smaller lower box, their long body becomes a liability: fewer safe routes, higher chance they\u2019re forced into our body.\n\nBetween **UP** and **LEFT**:\n\n- **UP** keeps us safe but a bit more central; it\u2019s slower to contest the critical **left-side choke**.\n- **LEFT**:\n  - Keeps us just as safe this turn.\n  - Moves us **closer to the left escape lane** we want to shut.\n  - Puts us one move from a free apple on (4,8).\n  - Continues the \u201cslide the ceiling left\u201d game plan we already started.\n\nWe\u2019re behind on apples, so **no head-on gambles** yet. Best way to be \u201caggressive\u201d here is to **tighten the cage** from above and snag uncontested apples while doing it.\n\nSo we slam **LEFT**.\n\n---\n\n## 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Note to future self (next few turns)\n\n- From **(5,8)**:\n  - Strong follow is **LEFT to (4,8)** to grab that apple and keep extending the row-8 ceiling.\n  - Keep an eye on the timing of our tail on the far right so we don\u2019t accidentally open a gap in the y=7 roof right when they drift left.\n- Long-term:  \n  - Extend across **row 8** to the left, then step **UP into row 9** to own the entire top.\n  - Once we\u2019re around **x=2\u20133** up top, look for a chance to **drop a vertical wall** toward the left side to lock them in the bottom box.\n  - Avoid any head-on lines until we\u2019ve narrowed the score gap; if we ever get the apple lead, we can start baiting them into dangerous channels for a winning collision.\n\nLEFT",

We **slide LEFT and tighten the noose** \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd2e Note to future self (next few turns)\n\n- From **(3,8)**, prioritize:\n  - **UP to (3,9)** or **LEFT to (2,8)**, grabbing apples while keeping at least **two safe exits** every turn.\n  - Keep extending across **row 8 and row 9 toward x=1**, then look to:\n    - Occupy **(1,8), (1,9), (2,9)**, etc.\n    - Later, drop a **vertical column** near **x=1\u20132** to seal the enemy in the bottom half.\n- Keep an eye on tail movement so we don\u2019t accidentally open a vertical escape lane exactly as they approach.\n- NO head-on trades until we\u2019ve closed that score gap or fully caged them.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy head is chilling way down at **(6,3)**.\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from (3,8)\n\nNeighbors:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (3,9)**  \n  - On board \u2705  \n  - Tile is `A` (apple) \ud83d\ude0b  \n  - Not in our body, not in theirs.  \n  - **SAFE** and we GROW.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (3,7)**  \n  - That\u2019s in our own body list.  \n  - Not the tail that\u2019s about to move (tail is at (2,7)).  \n  - Slam into that? We\u2019re SO done.  \n  - **ILLEGAL**.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (2,8)**  \n  - On board \u2705  \n  - Tile is `A` (apple) \ud83d\ude0b  \n  - Not in our body, not theirs.  \n  - **SAFE** and we GROW.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (4,8)**  \n  - That\u2019s the neck, direct backward. Instant L.  \n  - **ILLEGAL**.\n\nSo we\u2019ve got **two legal, safe moves**: **UP** and **LEFT**, and both give us an apple.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Any chance of a head-on?\n\nEnemy head: **(6,3)**. Their neck is at **(5,3)**, so they **can\u2019t go LEFT**.\n\nTheir options:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (6,4)** \u2190 their own body, suicide \u274c  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,2)** empty \u2705  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7,3)** apple \u2705  \n\nFrom (6,3), there is **no way** they can reach **(3,9)** or **(2,8)** this turn.  \nSo **no head-on risk** with either UP or LEFT. We\u2019re totally safe this turn.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Simulate our shape after each move\n\n### If we go UP \u2192 (3,9) \ud83c\udf4e\n\n- We eat the apple \u2192 **tail does NOT move**.  \n- New head: **(3,9)**.  \n- Body after move (head-to-tail):\n\n  (3,9), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8),  \n  (9,7), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7)\n\nCoverage:\n\n- **Row 7**: x=2\u21929 all ours (huge horizontal wall)  \n- **Row 8**: x=3\u21929 plus segment at (3,8)  \n- **Row 9**: now occupied at (3,9)\n\nNext-turn options from (3,9):\n\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,9) (empty) \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,9) (empty) \u2705  \n\nStill **two clean outs**, safely cruising along the top.\n\n### If we go LEFT \u2192 (2,8) \ud83c\udf4e\n\n- We eat the apple \u2192 **tail stays** at (2,7).  \n- New head: **(2,8)**.  \n- Body after move:\n\n  (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8),  \n  (9,7), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7)\n\nCoverage:\n\n- **Row 7**: x=2\u21929 all ours (same horizontal wall)  \n- **Row 8**: now x=2\u21929 all ours (we extended left by 1!)  \n- **Row 9**: still empty for us (tons of future room)\n\nNext-turn options from (2,8):\n\n- UP \u2192 (2,9) (empty) \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,8) (apple) \u2705  \n\nDOWN would hit our own body at (2,7), RIGHT is our neck. So again **two safe outs**.\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Big brain strategy \u2013 which move tightens the noose? \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d\n\nScoreboard check:  \n- **Us: 14**, **Enemy: 22**.  \nWe are **behind**, so any mutual death = we LOSE. No head-ons, no coinflips. Our win condition?  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Own the map**, force them into a mistake, let them die into our body.\n\nLook at the geometry:\n\n- We already have a massive **horizontal wall on row 7, x=2\u21929**.\n- After **LEFT**, we also own **row 8, x=2\u21929**, creating a thick horizontal band.\n- The enemy\u2019s only realistic path to the top side is via the **far-left columns (x=0 and x=1)**.\n- Our long-term trap:  \n  - Extend our control into **(2,8) \u2192 (1,8) \u2192 (1,7)** and up to **(1,9)/(0,9)**,  \n  - Build a **vertical barrier around x=1**, so they\u2019re locked forever in the bottom box.\n\nFrom current head **(3,8)**:\n\n- **UP to (3,9)** builds height but doesn\u2019t push left; it doesn\u2019t immediately contest that left corridor.\n- **LEFT to (2,8)**:\n  - Extends our top wall leftwards,\n  - Puts us **one move away** from the key choke at **(1,8)** (apple!),  \n  - Lines us up to drop into **(1,7)** soon and start that vertical prison wall.\n\nEnemy is miles away (Manhattan distance ~9 to those choke points), so **we can safely claim the entire top-left corner first** and make their life miserable later.\n\nBoth choices are safe, both give apples, but **LEFT**:\n\n- Improves our **positional dominance** over the only real escape lane,\n- Keeps our giant horizontal cutoff intact,\n- Puts us into a cluster of juicy apples at **(1,8), (0,9), (3,9)** to close the score gap.\n\nWhy float in the middle when we can **own the choke** and farm? \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd2e Plan for the next few turns (note to future snake)\n\n- From **(2,8)**:\n  - Likely go **LEFT to (1,8)** (apple) or **UP to (2,9)**, whichever keeps 2+ safe outs.\n  - Aim to occupy **(1,8)** then **(1,7)** to start a **vertical barrier on x=1**.\n- Keep the **row 7/8 band** unbroken from x=2\u21929 so they **cannot climb past us on the right**.\n- Avoid closing ourselves into a tiny top-left box; always maintain at least two exits (e.g. row 9 lane).\n- No suicidal head-ons while we\u2019re down by apples; we want them to eventually run into **our body**, not vice versa.\n\nWe keep the pressure, we keep the wall, we keep the dream alive.

Enemy head chilling way down at **(7,3)**. We OWN the high ground right now.\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from (2,8)\n\nNeighbors:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (2,9)**  \n  - On board \u2705  \n  - Tile is `.` (empty)  \n  - Not in our body, not in theirs  \n  - No apple, but totally **SAFE**\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (2,7)**  \n  - Currently our own **tail**  \n  - No apple there \u2192 tail will move off it this turn  \n  - Stepping into your own tail as it leaves is LEGAL \u2705  \n  - So **SAFE**\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (1,8)**  \n  - On board \u2705  \n  - Tile is `A` (apple) \ud83c\udf4e  \n  - Not in our body, not in theirs  \n  - **SAFE** and we GROW\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (3,8)**  \n  - That\u2019s the neck \u2013 backwards into our own body  \n  - Instant self-KO \u274c  \n  - **ILLEGAL**\n\nSo we\u2019ve got **three legal moves**: **UP, DOWN, LEFT**. Now we rank them \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Any chance of head-on collisions?\n\nEnemy head: **(7,3)**. Their options:\n\n- UP \u2192 (7,4) (empty)\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,2) (empty)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,3) (apple)\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,3) (their own neck, illegal)\n\nFrom there, they\u2019re **miles** away from our candidate tiles:  \n- (1,8), (2,9), (2,7) are all at Manhattan distance \u2265 7.  \n\nSo **NO head-on risk this turn** no matter what we do. That\u2019s huge.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Simulate our shape after each move\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Option A: LEFT \u2192 (1,8) \ud83c\udf4e\n\nWe eat the apple \u2192 **tail stays at (2,7)**.\n\nNew body (head to tail):\n\n- (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8),  \n  (9,7), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7)\n\nCoverage:\n- **Row 8:** x=1\u21929 all ours (solid top wall)\n- **Row 7:** x=2\u21929 all ours (second solid wall)\n- Enemy is still trapped **below** that band unless they sneak around left via x=0\u20131 later.\n\nNext-turn options from new head (1,8):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (1,9)** empty \u2705  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (0,8)** empty \u2705  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (1,7)** empty \u2705  \n\nThat\u2019s **3 clean outs** and we\u2019re sitting on the **key choke lane** on the left. Beautiful.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Option B: UP \u2192 (2,9)\n\nNo apple \u2192 tail moves from (2,7) to (3,7).\n\nNew body:\n\n- (2,9), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8),  \n  (9,7), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7)\n\nCoverage:\n- **Row 8:** x=2\u21929\n- **Row 7:** x=3\u21929 (we\u2019ve opened a gap at (2,7))\n\nNext-turn options from (2,9):\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (1,9)** empty \u2705  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (3,9)** apple \u2705  \n- DOWN is neck, UP is off-board.\n\nSo 2 good options, but **no apple this turn**, and we\u2019re not grabbing control of that critical **x=1 corridor** yet.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Option C: DOWN \u2192 (2,7)\n\nNo apple \u2192 tail moves from (2,7) to (3,7).\n\nNew body:\n\n- (2,7), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8),  \n  (9,7), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7)\n\nCoverage:\n- **Row 7:** x=2\u21929 (full wall restored)\n- **Row 8:** x=2\u21929\n\nNext-turn options from (2,7):\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (1,7)** empty \u2705  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (2,6)** empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT might become tail later, but still, we\u2019re moving **down toward the enemy** without gaining apples.\n\nThis keeps the wall but doesn\u2019t improve our position on the left choke or score.\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Macro gameplan: how do we actually WIN this? \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udd25\n\nScoreboard time:\n- **Us:** 15  \n- **Enemy:** 23  \n\nWe\u2019re **down by 8 apples**. That means:\n- Any **mutual death right now** = we LOSE.\n- We **do not** want head-on trades yet.\n- We need to **grow**, control space, and force them to eventually crash into **our body**, not our head.\n\nLook at the geometry:\n\n- We already have a **double horizontal wall** across rows 7 and 8 on the right:\n  - Row 7: x=2\u21929  \n  - Row 8: x=2\u21929 (after LEFT it becomes x=1\u21929)\n- The only realistic way for enemy to reach the top side is to snake up **the far-left columns (x=0 and x=1)**.\n- That means the **left corridor is the single most important area** on the board.\n\nWhat does each move do to that corridor?\n\n- **UP to (2,9)**: keeps us strong, but we\u2019re still at x=2. Enemy can eventually race for x=1 while we\u2019re a step slower to the choke.\n- **DOWN to (2,7)**: drifts us TOWARD the enemy, gives no apple, and doesn\u2019t threaten the choke at all.\n- **LEFT to (1,8)**:\n  - Snags an **apple right now** (closing the score gap from -8 to -7),\n  - Extends our wall left into the critical **x=1 lane**,  \n  - Puts us one move away from **(1,7)** and **(1,9)/(0,8)/(0,9)** to start building a **vertical prison wall** on the left side.\n\nFrom (1,8) we\u2019ll have **three exits** and a whole cluster of apples nearby:\n- (1,8) \u2192 (1,9) \u2192 (0,9) apple\n- Or (1,8) \u2192 (2,9) \u2192 (3,9) apple  \nWe can farm the **top-left corner** while the enemy is still tangled in the bottom maze.\n\nThis is exactly what we want:\n- **Maximum safety** (enemy far away),\n- **Maximum apples** this turn,\n- **Maximum positional squeeze** on their only escape route.\n\n---\n\n## 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Note to future self (next few turns plan) \ud83d\udcdd\n\n- From **(1,8)**, prioritize:\n  - Securing **top-left apples**: (0,9), (3,9) while keeping at least **2 escape options** each turn.\n  - Gradually extend a **vertical barrier** down around **x=1** (e.g. stepping into (1,7) when it\u2019s safe) to make it harder for them to ever reach the top.\n- Don\u2019t fully seal yourself into a tiny top-left pocket; always maintain a path back along row 9 or row 8.\n- No suicidal head-ons until we\u2019re at least even or ahead on apples; our win condition is them **slamming into our wall** trying to escape.\n\nWe take space, we take apples, we take control.

No matter what we do, they land at (8,2), no apple, tail moves off (1,2).\n\nImportant:  \nNone of our candidate tiles **(1,9), (1,7), (0,8)** match **(8,2)**, so:\n- **No head-on collision risk this turn**  \n- We\u2019re totally safe to choose among UP / DOWN / LEFT\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Simulate our shape for each move\n\nCurrent body (head\u2192tail):  \n(1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8), (9,7), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7), (2,7)  \nTail: **(2,7)**\n\nWe are **not eating** this turn no matter what, so tail will move off **(2,7)**.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Option A: UP \u2192 (1,9)\n\nNew body (after tail moves off 2,7):\n\n- (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8),\n  (9,7), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7)\n\nCoverage:\n- **Row 9:** now has our head at (1,9)\n- **Row 8:** still solid from x=1\u21929\n- **Row 7:** x=3\u21929 (we\u2019ve opened (2,7))\n\nNext-turn options from **(1,9)**:\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,9) **apple** \ud83c\udf4e \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,9) empty \u2705  \n(UP is off-board, DOWN is neck.)\n\nSo we\u2019ll still have **two safe exits** and **direct access to top apples**.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Option B: LEFT \u2192 (0,8)\n\nNew body:\n\n- (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8),\n  (9,7), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7)\n\nCoverage:\n- **Row 8:** we now span x=0\u21929 (full top row minus 9)\n- **Row 7:** x=3\u21929\n\nNext-turn options from **(0,8)**:\n- UP \u2192 (0,9) **apple** \ud83c\udf4e \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,7) empty \u2705  \n(RIGHT is neck, LEFT is off-board.)\n\nStill 2 exits, but we\u2019re hugging the **corner**, which always limits future flexibility a bit.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Option C: DOWN \u2192 (1,7)\n\nNew body:\n\n- (1,7), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8),\n  (9,7), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7)\n\nCoverage:\n- **Row 8:** x=1\u21929\n- **Row 7:** x=1 and x=3\u21929 (we just replaced the old tail at 2,7 with (1,7))\n\nNext-turn options from **(1,7)**:\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,7) empty \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,6) empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,7) empty (tail already left) \u2705  \n\nThis keeps us super flexible and starts a **vertical drop on the left side**, which is good for boxing.\n\nBut: it delays apples compared to the other routes:\n- To hit **(1,4)** from (1,7) is 3 extra steps.\n- Meanwhile we\u2019ve got free apples sitting right above us.\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategy check: score + macro gameplan\n\nScoreboard:\n- **Us:** 16  \n- **Enemy:** 24  \n\nWe\u2019re **down 8 apples**. That means:\n- Any **mutual head-on** right now = we LOSE.\n- Our win condition: **grow huge**, control space, and eventually make them slam into our **body**, not trade heads.\n\nEnemy path we just traced:\n- This turn: forced to **(8,2)**.\n- Next turn from there: almost certainly **LEFT to (7,2)** (only legal).\n- Then they\u2019re basically forced toward the apple at **(6,2)**.\nThey\u2019re crawling along the top of their own row-1 line with **very limited freedom**. That\u2019s great for us \u2014 they\u2019re bottled up in the **bottom-right / bottom-middle**.\n\nWe, meanwhile, have:\n- Massive, safe territory in the **entire top half**.\n- Easy apples at **(0,9)** and **(3,9)**,\n- Plus mid-top apples like **(4,6)** and **(1,4)** to farm later.\n\nSo what do we want this move?\n\n- **Safety**: all three (UP, DOWN, LEFT) are safe now, enemy can\u2019t touch us.\n- **Future options**: DOWN gives 3 exits, UP/LEFT give 2 but are still safe.\n- **Apple tempo**:\n  - UP \u2192 (1,9) then LEFT \u2192 (0,9) = apple in 2 moves.\n  - LEFT \u2192 (0,8) then UP \u2192 (0,9) = also apple in 2 moves.\n  - DOWN \u2192 (1,7) then chase (1,4) = slower.\n\nBetween UP and LEFT:\n- Both reach **(0,9)** apple in the same number of turns.\n- But **UP keeps us off the corner**, in a slightly more central, flexible position at (1,9).\n- From (1,9) we can choose: grab (0,9) **or** start sweeping rightward along row 9 toward **(3,9)** and **(9,9)**. That\u2019s huge top-lid control.\n\nGiven enemy\u2019s stuck in the basement, we should:\n- Use our freedom to **farm the entire top** safely,\n- Get closer on apples before we start dropping the hammer downward to box them.\n\nSo between the safe moves, **UP** gives us:\n- Great safety,\n- Better long-term flexibility than diving into the corner,\n- Direct, fast routes to multiple top apples.\n\nWe take **UP**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc Plan for future self\n\n- Prioritize the **top-row apples** (0,9), (3,9), (9,9) while staying with at least **2 safe moves** each turn.\n- Keep using our snake as a **lid on the top half**, then later extend a **vertical wall** down the left side (x=1 / x=0) once we\u2019ve bulked up on apples.\n- Avoid any head-on possibilities until we\u2019re at least close to their score; we want them trapped and forced into our body, not a fair trade.\n\nUP",

No apples there, so their tail at **(1,1)** will move.\n\nNeither of our candidate moves goes anywhere near **(7,2)**, so:\n- No head-on risk,\n- No weird simultaneous collision issues this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Simulate our shape for each move\n\nCurrent body (head\u2192tail):\n\n(1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8),\n(9,7), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7)\n\nTail: **(3,7)**.\n\n#### Option A: LEFT \u2192 (0,9) [eat apple]\n\nWe eat the apple at (0,9), so we **grow**:\n- New head: **(0,9)**\n- Old tail **(3,7) stays** this turn.\n\nNew body:\n\n(0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8),\n(9,7), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7)\n\nNext turn from **(0,9)**:\n- UP \u2192 off-board\n- LEFT \u2192 off-board\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,9) = neck\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,8) = empty\n\nSo we\u2019ll be **forced DOWN to (0,8)** next turn, but that\u2019s safe.\n\nThen from (0,8) we\u2019ll be forced **DOWN again to (0,7)**, and only after that do we regain branching (from (0,7) we can go DOWN or RIGHT). That sequence drops us **down the left edge**, keeping our big horizontal wall across y=8 and y=7 and starting a vertical wall at x=0.\n\nThis is great for:\n- Building a **top-left \u201clid + wall\u201d structure**,\n- Gaining control of the **left side and central lanes** later (toward apples like **(1,4)** and **(4,6)**),\n- While enemy is stuck in the bottom-right slowly crawling left.\n\n#### Option B: RIGHT \u2192 (2,9) [no apple]\n\nMove RIGHT, no growth, so tail moves forward off **(3,7)**:\n\nNew body:\n\n(2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8),\n(9,7), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7)\n\nNext turn from **(2,9)**:\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,9) = apple, empty\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,9) = neck\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,8) = body\n- UP \u2192 off-board\n\nSo we\u2019re **forced RIGHT** to the apple at (3,9), then forced RIGHT again and again across the top row until we eventually hit **(9,9)** (another apple), then we\u2019ll be forced DOWN on the right edge.\n\nThis line:\n- Farms **top-right apples** efficiently,\n- But keeps us glued to the **top row**, with almost no ability to drop into the mid-board for several turns, since row 8 under us is our own solid body.\n\nSo RIGHT is safe, apple-rich, but very \u201crailroaded\u201d along the top, and doesn\u2019t contest the middle.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Strategic comparison\n\nScoreboard:\n- Us: **16**\n- Enemy: **24** (up by 8)\n\nWe **cannot** accept a mutual head-on; we lose that trade. Our path to victory:\n- Grow big,\n- Control space,\n- Force them to hit our body, not our head.\n\nEnemy path from bottom:\n- Currently at **(8,2)** \u2192 forced to **(7,2)** \u2192 then forced to **(6,2)** apple \u2192 then they\u2019ll crawl left along row 2.\n- They\u2019re locked low, in a long, narrow corridor at y=1\u20133.\n\nWe, on the other hand, dominate y=7\u20139. The crucial idea now is:  \nDo we just farm the very top (RIGHT), or start building a **left-side descent** to pressure the center and set up a box (LEFT)?\n\n- **RIGHT** keeps us on the ceiling, lets enemy eventually leak upward through the open left-side columns while we\u2019re busy on the far right.\n- **LEFT** immediately grabs an apple and starts a **vertical wall on x=0**, with our huge horizontal band at y=8 acting as a lid. After a couple forced steps, we get flexibility back and can sweep rightward under our own lid (around y=7/6) to contest central apples and close the net on them.\n\nGiven:\n- We\u2019re behind on apples,\n- Enemy is funneled along the bottom and moving **leftward**,\n- The only clear shaft to the top is around **x=0**,\n\nIt\u2019s stronger to:\n- Take the free apple now,\n- Slide down the left edge,\n- Use our length to build a **left + top cage**, then swing inward to choke their exits before thinking about any collision plays.\n\nSo between the two safe options, **LEFT** gives better positional control and still keeps us safe.\n\n---\n\n### Plan for future self\n\n- After going **LEFT to (0,9)**, accept the forced drops to **(0,8)** then **(0,7)**; that\u2019s fine, we\u2019re sculpting the left wall.\n- From **(0,7)**, start using the new branching: likely move **RIGHT** along row 7 under our solid row-8 lid, aiming toward **(1,4)** and **(4,6)** while keeping y\u22656.\n- Track enemy as they crawl along row 2. Our long-term goal: extend a vertical barrier down from the left side toward mid-board, then curve right to box them into the lower corridor, denying them any clean path to y\u22655.\n- No head-on plays until our apple count is at least close to theirs; aim to make them slam into our body, not our face.\n\nLEFT",

Time to audit our options:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Check ALL four directions from (0,8)\n\n**1\ufe0f\u20e3 UP \u2192 (0,9)**  \n- That\u2019s literally our own **neck segment**.  \n- Moving backwards into your neck = **instant self-KO** \ud83d\udc80  \n\u27a1\ufe0f **ILLEGAL.**\n\n**2\ufe0f\u20e3 LEFT \u2192 (-1,8)**  \n- x = -1 is off the board.  \n\u27a1\ufe0f **INSTANT DEATH.** \u274c\n\n**3\ufe0f\u20e3 RIGHT \u2192 (1,8)**  \n- Look at row 8: `8 0 T T T T T T T T T`  \n- (1,8) is a **T** \u2013 our own body.  \n\u27a1\ufe0f Walking into that is straight griefing \u2192 **DEAD.** \ud83d\udc80\n\n**4\ufe0f\u20e3 DOWN \u2192 (0,7)**  \n- Check row 7: `7 . . . . T T T T T T`  \n- (0,7) is `.` = **empty**.  \n- No apple there, but totally safe.  \n- Enemy is way down at (6,2); they can\u2019t possibly hit (0,7) this turn.  \n\u27a1\ufe0f **ONLY safe move.**\n\nSo yeah, chat, this turn we are **HARD-FORCED** to go **DOWN**. Every other direction is turbo-int. \ud83d\ude02\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Simultaneous move check (enemy snake)\n\nEnemy head: **(6,2)**. Let\u2019s see what THEY can do:\n\n- UP \u2192 (6,3) = their own body \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,1) = their own body \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,2) = their own body \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,2) = empty `.` \u2705\n\nSo they\u2019re also **forced LEFT to (5,2)**. No apples there, so:\n- They don\u2019t grow.\n- Their tail at **(2,1)** comes off.\n\nCrucially:  \n- No way they reach **(0,7)** this turn.  \n- No chance of a head-on or weird collision with our move DOWN.\n\nWe live clean this turn. \u2705\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 Our new shape after moving DOWN\n\nCurrent body (head \u2192 tail):\n\n(0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8),  \n(9,7), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7), (4,7)\n\nMove **DOWN \u2192 (0,7)**, no apple, so tail at **(4,7)** disappears.\n\nNew body becomes:\n\n(0,7),  \n(0,8), (0,9), (1,9), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (9,8),  \n(9,7), (8,7), (7,7), (6,7), (5,7)\n\nWe\u2019re building a **massive lid** across the top (rows 7\u20139) plus a **hard left wall** at x=0. That\u2019s board control, baby \ud83d\ude0e\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd3 Strategy note to future self (next few turns)\n\n- From **(0,7)** next turn:\n  - UP \u2192 neck (0,8) \u274c  \n  - LEFT \u2192 off-board \u274c  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (1,7) is **empty** \u2705  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (0,6) is **empty** \u2705  \n- That means after this forced **DOWN**, we finally unlock **two branching options**: RIGHT and DOWN.  \n- Plan:\n  - Likely start sweeping **RIGHT along row 7**, extending our horizontal wall under the top lid.\n  - Or dip **DOWN to row 6** if we need more vertical space, but priority is to sprawl and **cut the board horizontally**.\n- Long-term goal:  \n  - Keep owning the **upper half** of the map.  \n  - Enemy\u2019s stuck in the **lower-middle** (y\u22481\u20134).  \n  - Use our massive body to box them in from above and the sides, and eventually force them to crash into our segments.  \n- We\u2019re down **17 vs 25 apples**, so:\n  - **NO head-on trades yet** \u2013 if we double-KO, we **lose on score**.  \n  - Grow safely when possible, but main win condition is **space domination \u2192 force their misplay**.\n\nAlright chat, no debate this turn. We lock in the only non-throw move:\n\nDOWN",

Time to audit every direction.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Check all four directions from (0,7)\n\n**UP \u2192 (0,8)**  \n- That\u2019s our own body segment, and specifically the neck we just came from.  \n- Moving directly backwards into our body = instant self-KO.  \n\u2192 **ILLEGAL.**\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (-1,7)**  \n- x = -1 is off-board.  \n\u2192 **INSTANT DEATH.** No shot.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (1,7)**  \n- Board row 7 col 1 is `.` (empty).  \n- Not our body, not theirs, inside the board.  \n- Enemy is way down at y=2; they can\u2019t reach (1,7) this turn from (5,2).  \n\u2192 **CURRENTLY SAFE.**\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (0,6)**  \n- Board row 6 col 0 is `.` (empty).  \n- No body there, no apple, fully open.  \n- Again, enemy can\u2019t get anywhere near that square this turn.  \n\u2192 **CURRENTLY SAFE.**\n\nSo we\u2019ve got exactly **two** legal, safe moves: **RIGHT** and **DOWN**.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Quick enemy check (for surprise head-ons)\n\nEnemy head: (5,2).\n\nFrom there:\n- UP \u2192 (5,3) is their own body.\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,1) is their own body.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,2) is their own body.\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,2) is empty.\n\nSo the only legal move for them is **LEFT to (4,2)**. That square is far from both (1,7) and (0,6), so:\n\n- No matter what we pick (RIGHT or DOWN), there is **no possible head-on** this turn.\n- We don\u2019t care if they play \u201cbad\u201d and go into their own body; that just kills them and we auto-win, and they still can\u2019t collide with us in the process this turn.\n\nSo both our candidate moves are **safe this turn** from every angle.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Compare our two real options\n\nWe are down on score:  \n- Us: 17  \n- Enemy: 25  \n\nSo we **cannot** afford a double-KO tie on lives; we\u2019d lose on apples. We want:\n- Safe growth,\n- Better board control,\n- Long-term setup to box them and force them into our body.\n\n#### Option A: RIGHT \u2192 (1,7)\n\n- New head at (1,7), tail at (5,7) gets removed (no apple).\n- Our top wall stays huge: row 8 is a full body line from x=0\u20139.\n- Row 7 after that: we\u2019d have head at x1, plus body at x0 and x6\u20139.  \n- Next turn from (1,7):\n  - UP \u2192 (1,8) is our body (illegal).\n  - LEFT \u2192 back into (0,7) neck (illegal).\n  - DOWN \u2192 (1,6) is an apple, safe.\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (2,7) is empty, safe.\n- So from RIGHT, we\u2019d still have **2 good options** (DOWN to apple at (1,6) or continue RIGHT).\n\nThis keeps us mostly in the top band and slowly extends a second horizontal layer on row 7.\n\n#### Option B: DOWN \u2192 (0,6)\n\n- New head at (0,6), tail at (5,7) gets removed (no apple).\n- We start carving a **vertical wall down the left side**, while still owning the entire row 8 and a fat chunk of row 7.\n- Next turn from (0,6):\n  - UP \u2192 back into (0,7) neck (illegal).\n  - LEFT \u2192 off-board (illegal).\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (1,6) is an apple, safe.\n  - DOWN \u2192 (0,5) is empty, safe.\n- Again, **2 good follow-ups**: RIGHT to apple at (1,6) or continue DOWN deeper into the open space.\n\nStrategically, going **DOWN**:\n- Moves us closer to the central/lower area where the enemy lives.\n- Starts building a tall **left-side wall** that, together with our massive top wall, can eventually help box them in.\n- Keeps our options wide: we can pivot RIGHT across row 6 toward the middle, scooping apples and expanding our \u201cceiling\u201d over them from above-left.\n\nGoing RIGHT just fattens the existing top band without actually pushing pressure toward them yet.\n\nGiven we\u2019re behind on score, we **need** to start positioning to contest space and eventually corner them, not just sit in the stratosphere.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Long-term note to future self\n\nFrom (0,6):\n\n- Strong follow-up is **RIGHT to (1,6)** next turn to grab that apple and grow without shrinking our tail, while keeping both RIGHT and DOWN lanes open afterward.\n- Use the left edge as a safe anchor: slide down and then sweep RIGHT through rows 5\u20136 to start dominating the middle-left and cutting off escape routes.\n- Maintain a thick top band as a hard ceiling; don\u2019t allow an early gap that lets the enemy slip above us. As we move down and right, watch which top segments get trimmed by the tail so we don\u2019t give them a free escape lane.\n- No head-on collisions until we\u2019re at least even on apples; we only take a trade if we\u2019re clearly ahead on score or can force them into our body while we stay free.\n\nWe want to turn this left descent into the start of a big wrap-around cage.\n\nDOWN",

That\u2019s one of the key \u201cceiling\u201d cells that helps keep the enemy bottled under us.\n- We also **don\u2019t grow**, letting the tail keep chewing through our top wall on future non-apple moves, making it easier for them to slip out later.\n\nGiven we:\n- Are **behind on score**,  \n- Want to **maintain a strong ceiling** over them, and  \n- Have a **free apple right next to our face**\u2026\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **RIGHT to (1,6)** is just strictly better here.\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term plan note for future me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- From **(1,6)**, prioritize moves that:\n  - Keep at least **2\u20133 escape options** every turn,\n  - Let us **sweep right across row 6**, then possibly dip down across row 5,\n  - Aim for apples like **(4,6)**, **(9,5)**, and the mid-left apples at (1,4), (2,4) as we extend.\n- The goal: build a **wide horizontal band** across rows 6\u20137 while our full row-8 wall remains mostly intact, creating a massive \u201croof\u201d and \u201cmezzanine\u201d above the enemy.\n- Once we\u2019re longer and closer on the left/middle, we can start tightening:\n  - Push a **rightward barrier** above them,\n  - Then work **downward** on the right side later to close the box.\n- No head-on trades until we\u2019ve **caught up or passed** in apples; our body should be the weapon, not a coin-flip with our head.\n\nTime to farm that apple and keep the cage strong. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Toss it. \ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 RIGHT \u2013 Horizontal sweep toward (4,6) apple\n\nIf we go **RIGHT \u2192 (2,6)**:\n\n- Head: (2,6)  \n- No apple this turn \u2192 our **tail moves** from (6,7) to (7,7).\n- That means:\n  - We **open up** (6,7) this turn,\n  - And if we keep not eating, soon (7,7), then (8,7), etc. get vacated.\n- Plan from here is probably:\n  - Walk along row 6: (2,6) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 (4,6) (apple),\n  - Only then do we get growth and freeze tail for a turn.\n\nPros:\n- Stays **above** the enemy, along a nice \u201cceiling line\u201d.\n- Keeps **3 follow-up options** each step.\n- Heads toward apple at (4,6) for growth.\n\nCons:\n- We **don\u2019t eat immediately**, so our tail starts chewing through row 7:\n  - First losing (6,7), then (7,7), then (8,7)\u2026\n- That slowly **weakens our second-row barrier** under the full row-8 roof.\n- The enemy might eventually exploit that loosened mid-band to slip into bigger open spaces.\n\nIt\u2019s a decent, safe line, but we can do **better**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705\u2705 DOWN \u2013 Vertical dive + double apple chain + stronger roof\n\nIf we go **DOWN \u2192 (1,5)**:\n\n- Head: (1,5)\n- No apple this turn \u2192 tail goes (6,7) \u2192 (7,7), just like with RIGHT.\n- BUT look at the follow-up from (1,5):\n  - DOWN \u2192 (1,4) = **apple** \ud83c\udf4e\n  - From (1,4), we can go to (2,4) = **another apple** \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nSo likely sequence:\n- **T46:** (1,6) \u2192 (1,5) (no apple, tail to 7,7)\n- **T47:** (1,5) \u2192 (1,4) (apple, tail STAYS at 7,7)\n- **T48:** (1,4) \u2192 (2,4) (apple, tail STILL at 7,7)\n\nWhat does that do for us?\n\n\ud83d\udd25 **Huge pros:**\n\n1. **We eat much faster than the RIGHT line.**  \n   - Two apples in a few turns = +2 length while still hovering around the choke area.\n   - Extra length = a fatter, nastier cage later.\n\n2. **We freeze the tail high up.**  \n   - After this turn, tail lands at (7,7), but then:\n     - Eating at (1,4) keeps it there,\n     - Eating again at (2,4) keeps it there again.\n   - Our **top roof (row 8) and mid wall (row 7)** stay **thick** much longer.\n   - That roof is our biggest advantage over them.\n\n3. **We push into the LEFT/MID corridor** where the enemy wants to escape.\n   - Enemy head is at (3,2), likely path:\n     - to (2,2) apple, then towards (1,2)/(0,2)/(0,1) for more food.\n   - By dropping towards **(1,4)/(2,4)** first, we:\n     - Get to those mid-left apples **before** they can,\n     - Start building a **vertical presence** above their approach route.\n   - That\u2019s exactly how we **deny their food** and start **boxing them from the left side**.\n\n4. **Good local safety.**\n   - From (1,5) we still have **3 options** (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n   - No immediate collision paths with any of their three possible moves this turn.\n\nBetween RIGHT and DOWN, both safe, both with future flexibility, **DOWN gives us**:\n- Faster growth,\n- Better preservation of our \u201croof\u201d,\n- Stronger position to contest the LEFT apple corridor,\n- Better setup for a future vertical + horizontal cage.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 DOWN is the aggressive, smart, *positionally dominant* choice. \ud83d\ude24\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Quick note to Future Me \ud83e\udde0 (Strategy for next few turns)\n\n- From **(1,5)**:\n  - Very high priority to grab **(1,4)** then **(2,4)** apples *if still safe*. We want that double-grow while keeping the tail pinned up around **(7,7)** to maintain our top cage.\n- Use that growth to start building a **vertical wall in the x\u22482\u20133 region**, leaning down toward the enemy\u2019s lane near y=2\u20133.\n- Aim to:\n  - Control the **left-side apple farm** (0,2 / 2,2 / 0,1 / bottom-row apples),\n  - Deny the enemy easy expansion into the left half,\n  - Keep at least **2 safe exits** every turn; don\u2019t tunnel blindly where our own body + enemy\u2019s wall might pinch us.\n- Do **NOT** accept a mutual head-on while behind on apples. We only want:\n  - Them ramming their head into our body, or\n  - A head-on where we\u2019re clearly ahead on score.\n\nWe keep the roof, fatten the body, and start sliding down to build the box. Time to starve this dude out. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

Big W.**\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (0,5)**  \n  - Also an **apple** at (0,5) \ud83c\udf4e  \n  - No body there, so safe this turn.  \n  - But check follow-ups from (0,5):  \n    - UP \u2192 (0,6) our body \u274c  \n    - LEFT \u2192 off-board \u274c  \n    - RIGHT \u2192 (1,5) backwards \u274c  \n    - DOWN \u2192 (0,4) empty \u2705  \n  \ud83d\udc49 Only **ONE** legal move next turn (DOWN). Super forced, zero flexibility. \ud83d\udea8\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (2,5)**  \n  - Cell is `.` empty \u2705  \n  - No apple, so no growth; tail moves from (7,7) \u2192 (8,7), slightly thinning the mid wall.  \n  - Next turn from (2,5):  \n    - UP \u2192 (2,6) empty \u2705  \n    - DOWN \u2192 (2,4) apple \u2705  \n    - RIGHT \u2192 (3,5) empty \u2705  \n    - LEFT \u2192 (1,5) backwards \u274c  \n  \ud83d\udc49 **3 strong options**, but **no apple this turn** and we start peeling our roof.\n\nSo **safe moves**:  \n- **DOWN (1,4 apple)**  \n- **LEFT (0,5 apple but forced path)**  \n- **RIGHT (2,5, flexible but no apple)**\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What can the enemy do?\n\nEnemy head: **(2,2)**\n\nTheir options:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (2,3)** empty \u2705  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (1,2)** empty \u2705  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (2,1)** empty \u2705  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (3,2)** is their own body (backwards) \u274c\n\nOur candidate head squares vs theirs this turn:\n- Us: (1,4), (0,5), (2,5)  \n- Them: (2,3), (1,2), (2,1)\n\nNo overlap, no chance of same-cell head-on this move \u2705  \nAlso none of our target cells are currently enemy body \u2705\n\nSo all three candidate moves are **immediately safe**. The question is: **which one gives us the best future to kill this guy?** \ud83d\ude0f\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare the good moves \u2013 who helps us BOX and GROW?\n\nRemember:\n- We\u2019re **down 18 vs 26** \u2192 a mutual head-on is **auto-loss** for us.\n- Our win condition is: **grow big, control space, make them slam into our body.**\n- Keep options open, don\u2019t funnel ourselves into choke points for no reason.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 LEFT \u2192 (0,5) (apple but forced)\n\nPros:\n- Instant apple, tail stays at (7,7) this turn.\n- Opens path to a vertical run down the left wall grabbing (0,4), (0,2), (0,1) later.\n\nCons:\n- After moving to (0,5), we\u2019re basically **forced DOWN to (0,4)** next turn.  \n- Hugging the left wall with only one escape move is exactly how you get self-boxed later if things get messy.  \n- Also drifts us a bit **away from the central fight** where the enemy lives.\n\nVerdict: Tasty, but **too rigid**. We want aggression + flexibility, not a 1-option tunnel.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 RIGHT \u2192 (2,5) (flexible but no apple)\n\nPros:\n- Great mobility: 3 good moves after.\n- Positions us **directly above** the enemy column (they\u2019re at (2,2)), good for future pressure.\n- From there we can hit **(2,4)** apple next turn, then pivot.\n\nCons:\n- No apple now \u2192 **tail moves off (7,7)**, slightly weakening our mid wall on row 7.  \n- We **delay growth** by a turn even though we\u2019re behind and apples are everywhere.  \n- With the enemy only 4 apples away from an auto-win at 30, we really can\u2019t afford to be slow.\n\nVerdict: Positionally decent, but we can do basically the **same central play** while also eating right away.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd25 DOWN \u2192 (1,4) (apple + central control)\n\nPros:\n1. **Immediate apple** \ud83c\udf4e  \n   - We go 18 \u2192 **19 apples**.  \n   - Tail stays pinned at **(7,7)**, keeping our top cage strong for another turn.\n\n2. **Great follow-up apples & space**  \n   - From (1,4), we can:\n     - Go **RIGHT to (2,4)** (another apple)  \n     - Or spread into (0,4)/(1,3) to shape the left/center corridor.\n   - That lines up perfectly with our earlier idea: **chain (1,4) \u2192 (2,4)** for back-to-back growth.\n\n3. **Central AND aggressive**  \n   - We\u2019re now sitting just **above and left** of the enemy\u2019s pocket.  \n   - While they likely go toward bottom apples (2,1 \u2192 2,0, then across), we\u2019re dropping a thick body into the mid-left to:\n     - Grab apples **they might want later** (0,2, 1,0 path area),\n     - Start forming a **vertical wall** they\u2019ll have to respect.\n\n4. **Good future options**  \n   - From (1,4) we still have 3 safe moves next turn. We\u2019re not boxed-in, we\u2019re not on the wall, and we\u2019re not over-committed to a bad corridor.\n\nVerdict: **DOWN is the nut play** \u2013 grow now, keep the roof thick, stay central, and keep multiple outs.\n\n---\n\n## 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategy note for Future Me \ud83e\udde0\n\n- Short-term:\n  - Prioritize **(1,4) \u2192 (2,4)** if still safe to grab that second apple immediately.\n  - Keep avoiding any line that could lead to a **same-cell head-on** with the enemy; we\u2019re still behind on score.\n- Medium-term:\n  - Use our length to build a **vertical + horizontal cage** around the mid-left/center (x \u2248 2\u20134, y \u2248 2\u20135).\n  - Force enemy deeper into the **bottom-right corner**, where their only \u201cescape\u201d lanes eventually run into our body.\n- Always:\n  - Keep at least **2 safe options** whenever possible.\n  - Prefer positions where **their head has to move toward our body** to access apples, so they eventually grief themselves into us.\n\nTime to farm and tighten the noose, chat \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc0d\n\nDOWN",

Guaranteed W instead of playing it out.  \n\u27a1\ufe0f **TOO RISKY \u2013 WE DON\u2019T GIVE THEM A FREE WIN**\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (0,4)**  \n- Empty, not a body, not off-board \u2705  \n- Enemy cannot reach (0,4) this turn (they can only go (1,3), (0,2), (1,1)).  \n- So immediate safety is fine.  \n- But next turn from (0,4):  \n  - UP \u2192 (0,5) apple \u2705  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (0,3) empty \u2705  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (1,4) backwards \u274c  \n  - LEFT \u2192 off-board \u274c  \n- Only **2 real options**, and we\u2019re hugging the left wall, limiting our ability to wrap around and box them later.  \n\u27a1\ufe0f Safe but **too passive and cramped**.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (2,4)**  \n- That\u2019s an **apple** \ud83c\udf4e but more importantly, it\u2019s **central space** we can use as a scaffold to build a cage.  \n- Not our body, not their body, fully clear.  \n- Enemy can move to (1,3), (0,2), or (1,1); NONE of those are (2,4), so **no head-on risk this turn**.  \n- After we land at (2,4):  \n  - UP \u2192 (2,5) empty \u2705  \n  - DOWN \u2192 (2,3) empty \u2705  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (3,4) empty \u2705  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (1,4) backwards \u274c  \n- That\u2019s **3 strong follow-ups**, and we keep ourselves in the **center-left**, right above their formation.  \n- Plus, we grow, which means our massive roof and side wall stay chunky for boxing later.  \n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **RIGHT is safe, flexible, and helps us build the kill-box.**\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Why RIGHT is the power play \ud83d\udcaa\n\n- We **avoid giving them a 50/50 head-on** at (1,3) that\u2019s actually 100% good for them.\n- We stay **central**, not glued to a wall, so we can snake down or across to start **circling their lower-right mass**.\n- Extra length from the apple = more body to form **hard walls** they can\u2019t cross without dying.\n- Enemy will likely dive for the huge apple bank bottom-left/bottom-center; we\u2019ll be dropping a long, thick body above and to the left of them, tightening the noose each turn.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Note to future me \ud83c\udfaf\n\n- From **(2,4)** next turn, favor moves that:\n  - Keep us with **at least two safe outs** (UP/RIGHT or UP/DOWN) \ud83e\udde0  \n  - Start drawing a **vertical bar** down in columns 2\u20133 or 3\u20134, connected to our big top roof, to lock them into the **bottom-right / mid-right** sector.\n- Keep refusing any **head-on lines** while we\u2019re behind on apples \u2013 we want them to **crash into our wall**, not trade heads.\n- As they farm the bottom apples, we want to **close the door behind them**, not chase directly in front of their face.\n\nWe\u2019re building the prison, chat\u2026 we just need them to walk into it \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc0d\n\nRIGHT",

If, by some miracle, they path weirdly, our expanding body gives more chances for them to slam into us.\n\nGoing DOWN or RIGHT just dumps us into tight lanes right above their wall, where they can force ugly trades we can\u2019t afford.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Note to future me \ud83d\udcd3\ud83d\udc0d\n\nFrom **(3,5)** next turn:\n\n- Prioritize **UP to (3,6)** for the apple if it stays open; that\u2019s free growth + pressure-free.\n- After that, look at **(3,7)** and **(4,6)** apples, but ALWAYS keep at least **2 safe exits**.\n- Avoid drifting too low toward their y=2 wall unless:\n  - We clearly see a path to body-block their head without opening a head-on lane we can\u2019t dodge.\n\nWe\u2019re behind, so we play **slippery and greedy**, not suicidal.

Gotta live, grow, and maybe make this dude bonk into our massive wall later \ud83d\udcaa\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Check all 4 directions from (3,5)\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (3,4)**  \n- That\u2019s literally our own body and directly backwards.  \n- Instant self-int, no content, only pain \ud83d\udc80  \n\u27a1\ufe0f **ILLEGAL.**\n\n---\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (2,5)**  \n- (2,5) is empty \u2705  \nBut what about NEXT turn from (2,5)?\n\nNeighbors from (2,5):  \n- UP \u2192 (2,6) empty \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,4) our body \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,5) our body \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,5) backwards \u274c  \n\nSo if we go LEFT, we end up with basically **one real escape (UP to 2,6)**. Why walk into a hallway with one door, chat? That\u2019s how horror movies start \ud83c\udfac\ud83d\ude05  \n\u27a1\ufe0f Super cramped, bad flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (4,5)**  \n- (4,5) is empty \u2705  \n\nNeighbors next turn from (4,5):  \n- UP \u2192 (4,6) = \ud83c\udf4e \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,4) empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,5) empty \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,5) backwards \u274c  \n\nSo **3 solid outs**, plus access to the apple at (4,6). Not bad at all!  \nBUT\u2026 look at the enemy cluster: (5,4), (5,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5)\u2026 that whole mid-right is their territory. Sliding RIGHT starts drifting us closer to their killbox. While we\u2019re behind on score, we *don\u2019t* want to gift them easy head-on lanes or tight dances near their wall.\n\n---\n\n**UP \u2192 (3,6)**  \n- (3,6) is a **free apple** \ud83c\udf4e and empty otherwise \u2705  \n\nNeighbors next turn from (3,6):  \n- UP \u2192 (3,7) = another apple \ud83c\udf4e\u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,6) empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,6) = apple \ud83c\udf4e\u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,5) backwards \u274c  \n\nThat\u2019s **3 strong outs** AND a built-in apple chain (3,6 \u2192 3,7 or 4,6).  \nWe stay in the central/top lane, away from their huge low wall at y=2 and their dense right cluster. More safety, more growth, more board control. What\u2019s not to like, chat? \ud83d\ude0f\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Strategic vibe check\n\n- Enemy is literally **two moves from 30** if they just go for bottom apples:\n  - (1,1) \u2192 (1,0) \ud83c\udf4e (29)\n  - (1,0) \u2192 (2,0) \ud83c\udf4e (30, GG)\n- We can\u2019t stop that directly from here, so our only win paths are:\n  - Stay **100% alive** (no YOLO suicides).  \n  - **Grow fast** off safe apples to make a gigantic, annoying body.  \n  - Hope they path greedy or sloppy and eventually slam into our wall while we dodge any head-on.\n\nGoing **UP** does exactly that:\n- Immediate apple.\n- Multiple future choices.\n- Access to **(3,7)** and **(4,6)** apples without hugging their murder rows (y=2\u20134, x\u22485\u20138).\n\nGoing RIGHT is playable but riskier long-term vs their formation.  \nGoing LEFT is just walking into a corridor for no reason.\n\nSo what do we do, chat? We take the juice AND the options \ud83d\ude24\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcd3 Note to future me (next few turns)\n\n- From **(3,6)**, prioritize chaining safe apples:\n  - Look at **UP to (3,7)** and **RIGHT to (4,6)**, but ALWAYS keep at least **2 safe exits**.\n- Keep building a chunky presence in the **upper-middle** under our roof at y=8.\n- Avoid drifting too far down toward their full wall on y=2 unless:\n  - We\u2019re clearly not in head-on range, OR  \n  - We\u2019re ahead on apples and can afford a head-on trade (not yet).\n- Big picture: stay slippery, grow fat, and let the enemy be the one to panic into our body \ud83d\ude08\n\nUP",

Playable, but not amazing flexibility.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udc49 RIGHT \u2192 (4,6)\n- (4,6) has an \ud83c\udf4e and no body \u2192 **we eat and grow** \u2705\n- New head would be at (4,6), score goes to **22**.\n\nFrom **(4,6)** next turn:\n- UP \u2192 (4,7) = empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,6) = empty \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,5) = empty \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,6) = our body \u274c  \n\nThat\u2019s **3 clean outs** and we stay in the juicy central/top lane with more apples nearby:\n- (6,6) \ud83c\udf4e\n- (3,7) \ud83c\udf4e\n- (0,5) \ud83c\udf4e\n- (9,5) \ud83c\udf4e\n- Later: (3,9), (9,9) up top \ud83c\udf4e\n\nWe\u2019re also still safely above their huge mid-lower blob. No realistic head-on danger in the next couple moves.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f Very flexible, very aggressive growth, strong map control \ud83d\udcaa\n\n---\n\n### \u261d\ufe0f UP \u2192 (3,7)\n- (3,7) has an \ud83c\udf4e and is empty \u2705\n- New head at (3,7), score would be **22**.\n\nFrom **(3,7)** next turn:\n- LEFT \u2192 (2,7) = empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,7) = empty \u2705\n- UP \u2192 (3,8) = our body \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,6) = our body \u274c  \n\nSo only **2 exits** (LEFT, RIGHT) along row 7. Still okay, corridor is wide, but not as many branches as going RIGHT to (4,6).\n\nWe also get slightly closer to our own big roof at y=8, which can become a bit claustrophobic if we\u2019re not careful.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Opponent vibe check \ud83d\ude08\n\nEnemy at **(1,0)** with an apple sitting RIGHT at **(2,0)**:\n- If they go RIGHT, they hit **30** and the game ends \ud83d\udca3\n- We can\u2019t reach 30 this turn no matter what, so we **can\u2019t** out-race that.\n\nBut we still have to play as if the game continues:\n- Don\u2019t die.\n- Maximize apples + space.\n- If they somehow don\u2019t insta-win, we want a **huge snake** owning the entire top and middle, ready to box them in and maybe force a panic crash later.\n\nGiven all that, between the safe moves:\n- LEFT: safe but meh, fewer futures, no apple.\n- UP: safe, apple, 2 exits.\n- RIGHT: safe, apple, **3 exits**, and expands our influence into the central lane above their mess.\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f **RIGHT is the best blend of survival, growth, and future control.**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 NOTE TO FUTURE ME (NEXT FEW TURNS):\n\n- From **(4,6)**:\n  - Prefer moves that keep at least **2 safe exits** at all times.\n  - Chain nearby apples safely: **(6,6)**, **(3,7)**, later **(0,5)/(9,5)**, then top apples **(3,9)/(9,9)**.\n- Keep building a **horizontal wall in the upper-middle** (y=6\u20137) that connects to our roof at y=8 \u2014 we want to sit above their entire formation.\n- Avoid diving too close to their dense cluster around **x=5\u20138, y=3\u20136** until:\n  - We\u2019re ahead on apples and a head-on trade favors us, or\n  - We see a clean chance to seal them in without risking our own head.\n- Priority: **stay alive, grow, own the top, and make them be the one who has to thread the needle near our body.**\n\nRIGHT",
