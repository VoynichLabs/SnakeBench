Also leads into a narrow corridor between my body/tail and the edge.\n- **UP:** My body part at (0, 1) will move technically, but since it's the segment directly behind the head, the head cannot move there (backward move).\n- Actually, I am at (0,0). My body is at (0,1), (1,1), (1,2).\n- Valid moves: NONE that are immediately safe and guaranteed?\n- Let's re-check coordinates:\nHead (0,0).\nTail segments: (0,1) is at y=1. (1,1) is at x=1, y=1. (1,2) is at x=1, y=2.\nThe segment at (0,1) is the one I just came from. Moving UP to (0,1) is moving backwards into my body.\nMoving LEFT is off-board. Moving DOWN is off-board.\nThe only possible move is RIGHT (1, 0).\n\nSnake #0 (Head 2, 0) also has limited options. (3, 0) is its body. Its valid moves are UP (2, 1), LEFT (1, 0), or RIGHT (not applicable, body at 3,0).\nIf Snake #0 moves LEFT to (1, 0) and I move RIGHT to (1, 0), we both die.\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (2, 1), I take (1, 0) safely.\nSince RIGHT is my only move that isn't an immediate wall/self-crash, I must take it and hope Snake #0 moves UP or we tie.\n\nStrategy: Take the only possible path (1, 0) and then navigate toward the apple at (4, 3) or (5, 2) while Snake #0 is occupied.\n\nRIGHT",

This is my own body (segment immediately behind the head).\n4. **RIGHT (2, 0):** This is currently Snake #0's body. Even though that segment (2, 0) will move to (2, 1) this turn, the rules state that moving into any part of a snake's body results in death. However, segment (2, 0) is the one behind Snake #0's head, which means it moves to (2, 1). Wait, the body list [(2, 0), (3, 0)] means (2, 0) is the first segment behind the head. It will move to where the head was (2, 1). Actually, moving to (2, 0) is safe because the tail segment at (3, 0) will move to (2, 0), and (2, 0) will move to (2, 1). \nWait, let's re-verify: If I move to (2, 0), and the enemy tail at (3, 0) moves forward, (2, 0) becomes empty? No, the body at (2, 0) moves to the previous head position (2, 1). The tail at (3, 0) moves to (2, 0). So (2, 0) will be occupied by the enemy tail.\n\nActually, I have **zero** safe moves. \n- UP at (1, 1) is my body.\n- LEFT at (0, 0) is my body.\n- DOWN is off-board.\n- RIGHT at (2, 0) is currently the enemy body. \n\nWait\u2014let\u2019s look at the body coordinates again.\nMy Head: (1, 0).

Moving UP to (1, 6) is the most direct way to contest the upper board and the apple at (5, 7). Moving LEFT is very passive and potentially traps me against the edge. If Snake #0 moves LEFT to (1, 6), they are essentially choosing to end the game with me as the winner. If they move UP or RIGHT, I take control of the (1, 6) space safely.\n\nLong-term plan:\nSecure the upper board. If survived this turn, target the apple at (5, 7) or (4, 3) depending on Snake #0's positioning. Maintain the score lead and avoid getting pinned against the left wall.\n\nUP",

UP: (1, 9). Safe. Snake #0 is at (2, 9). If they move LEFT to (1, 9), we collide and I win because my score (4) is higher than theirs (2).\n2. DOWN: (1, 7). Illegal (backwards into body).\n3. LEFT: (0, 8). Safe.\n4. RIGHT: (2, 8). Illegal (Snake #0's body).\n\nStrategic Evaluation:\nSnake #0 is currently at (2, 9). Their only safe moves are LEFT to (1, 9) or RIGHT to (3, 9). \n- If I move UP to (1, 9) and they move LEFT to (1, 9), we collide. Since I have 4 points and they have 2, I win immediately.\n- If I move UP to (1, 9) and they move RIGHT to (3, 9), I am in a strong position in the top corner with plenty of space to turn back towards the center apples.\n- Moving LEFT to (0, 8) is safe but pins me against the wall and doesn't apply pressure to the opponent.\n\nConclusion:\nMoving UP is the best move. It either forces a game-winning collision or positions me to intercept the apple at (5, 7) or (9, 9) while keeping the opponent cornered.\n\nLong-term plan:\nIf the game continues, head toward the apple cluster in the middle (5, 7) or (5, 4). My priority is to get my 5th apple to further secure the lead or force Snake #0 into a mistake.\n\nUP",

Body: [(6, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (6, 5)]\n- Apples: (9, 9), (0, 9), (9, 7), (2, 7), (7, 1)\n\nPotential Moves for Head (7, 2):\n1. **UP**: (7, 3). Safe. Moves towards apples at (9, 7) and (2, 7), but gets closer to Snake #0.\n2. **DOWN**: (7, 1). Safe. This collects an apple at (7, 1). This is a strong move as it's a direct point and moves away from the congested middle.\n3. **LEFT**: (6, 2). **DEATH** (Backward move).\n4. **RIGHT**: (8, 2). Safe. Moves toward the open right side.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Moving **DOWN** to (7, 1) is the most efficient choice. It immediately grants a point, increases my length (which is fine given the space), and shifts my head to a less crowded area of the board.\n- Snake #0 at (7, 6) is far away (5 units). Even if it moves down toward me, there is no threat of a head-on collision at (7, 1) this turn.\n- The area at y=0 and y=1 is mostly empty, providing plenty of room for my 11-segment body to maneuver as the middle section (rows 2-5) clears out.\n\nStrategy:\nTake the apple at (7, 1). Afterward, consider moving further down to (7, 0) or right toward (9, 0) and then up the right edge toward the apples at (9, 7) and (9, 9). This keeps the body organized and avoids the maze-like structure currently in the center.\n\nDOWN",

Moves toward the right edge and toward the clusters of apples at (9, 7), (8, 8), and (9, 9).\n\nAnalysis:\nRow 2 is almost entirely occupied by your own body (3, 2) to (7, 2).

Moving RIGHT to (8, 1) sets up a path to travel up the right wall to collect (9, 7), (8, 8), and (9, 9) in sequence.\n\nStrategy:\nMove RIGHT to (8, 1). From there, I will likely go RIGHT again to (9, 1) and then proceed UP the right-hand column to sweep the apples.

Moves toward the line of apples on the right side.\n\nAnalysis:\nMy body is currently concentrated in the lower-middle section of the board. The safest path to collect the apples at (9, 7), (8, 8), and (9, 9) is to travel straight up the rightmost column (Column 9). This keeps me as far as possible from my own body and avoids the path of Snake #0, which is currently at (8, 6).\n\nSnake #0 is small (length 5) and near (8, 6). If I move UP to (9, 2), I am five squares away from its current row (Row 6) and one column over. Continuing UP the right edge is highly efficient.\n\nStrategy:\nMove UP to (9, 2). Continue moving UP in column 9 to reach (9, 7) and then navigate to (8, 8) and (9, 9). This capitalizes on the cluster of apples while staying away from the central congestion.\n\nUP",

This moves toward the apple at (8, 4), (8, 8), and (9, 9).\n\nAnalysis:\nSnake #0 has just moved onto the apple previously at (9, 7). Its body now occupies (9, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6). \nMy body occupies a long horizontal stretch and a tail end at (4,3).\nI have two main safe options: UP to (9, 4) or LEFT to (8, 3).\nIf I move UP to (9, 4), I am 1 step away from the apple at (8, 4).\nIf I move LEFT to (8, 3), I am 1 step away from the apple at (8, 4).\n\nThe apple at (8, 4) is very close. Snake #0 is at (9, 7), which is 3 steps away from (8, 4). I am 2 steps away from it.\nMoving UP to (9, 4) is more efficient for the cluster at the top right, but I must be careful not to get pinned against the right wall by Snake #0. However, moving UP to (9, 4) puts me adjacent to the apple at (8, 4).\n\nStrategy:\nMove UP to (9, 4). From there, I can take the apple at (8, 4) by moving LEFT on the next turn. This keeps me moving toward the higher-value clusters while picking up a nearby snack.\n\nUP",

If I move UP to (3, 6), I am only two steps away from (2, 7), while Snake #0 at (4, 8) is also two steps away. There is a risk of a head-on collision at (2, 7) in two turns. However, moving toward the upper-left quadrant is my best chance for growth. The apples at the bottom right are currently obstructed by my own body. \n\nPlan:\nMove UP to (3, 6). This positions me to contest the apple at (2, 7). I must watch Snake #0's movement; if they move toward (2, 7), I need to be careful about a collision. If I get the apple at (2, 7), my next target will be (0, 9).\n\nUP",

If I move LEFT or DOWN, I stay alive. If Snake 0 takes the apple at (2, 7) this turn, its head will be at (2, 7) and its body will occupy (2, 8). I can then move to trap it or move toward the apple at (0, 9).\n\nHowever, looking at the board, Snake 0 is positioned in a way that if it takes (2, 7), it is heading into the bottom-left area. \nIf I move UP, I risk the game ending now. If I move LEFT, I am 1 move away from (0, 9) and (2, 7). \nCrucially, if I move UP and Snake 0 moves LEFT to (1, 8), I get the apple. But if Snake 0 moves DOWN (high probability), we both die. Given I am leading 13 to 7, a double-death results in my victory. However, I should play to survive if possible. \n\nWait, looking at Snake 0's body, it is quite long and currently near the top-right. If it moves to (2, 7), it's getting closer to the edge. Let's look for a safer move. \nIf I move UP and we collide, the game ends and I win (13 vs 7). This is a guaranteed win strategy.\n\nUP\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nI am leading 13 to 7. Moving UP to (2, 7) either secures me an apple or results in a head-on collision with Snake 0 if it also tries to take the apple. According to the rules, if both snakes die on the same turn, the snake with more apples wins. Since I have a significant lead, this move is either beneficial (getting the apple) or concludes the game in my victory.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Its valid moves are UP (0, 9), DOWN (0, 7), or RIGHT (1, 8 - neck, so invalid).\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 7) and Snake 0 moves DOWN to (0, 7), we collide and I win (score 14-7). \nIf I move LEFT to (0, 7) and Snake 0 moves UP to (0, 9) to get the apple, I am directly underneath it. \nIf I move DOWN to (1, 6), I play it safe and let Snake 0 have the top-left corner, which is a very tight space. \n\nConsidering I am currently winning by a large margin (14 to 7), forcing a collision or cornering the opponent is a viable strategy. If I move LEFT and Snake 0 moves UP to take the apple, it will be at (0, 9) with its body trailing behind it at (0, 8), (1, 8), etc., effectively trapping itself in the corner. If it moves DOWN, we collide and I win.\n\nLEFT is the most aggressive and strategically sound move to either end the game now or trap the opponent.\n\nLEFT",

Moving LEFT brings me closer to them, while UP or DOWN keeps more distance.\n- The apple at (7, 4) is very close. My current tail is at (0, 4), so the body will continue to vacate the bottom row (0,0)-(9,0) and move through the 4-row.\n- If I move LEFT to (7, 5), I can then go DOWN to (7, 4) to grab the apple. This is efficient.\n\nSafety Check:\n- If I move LEFT to (7, 5): Next turn (7, 4) will be empty (the segment at (6, 4) moves to (5, 4)). This is a very safe sequence.\n- Snake #0 is far enough away (5 units) that we won't have a head-on collision at (7, 5) or (7, 4) immediately.\n\nPlan:\nMove LEFT to (7, 5) to position for the apple at (7, 4).\n\nLEFT",

The board representation shows 'T' at (7, 4) because it was part of my body previously, but according to the provided Body list: `[(8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4), (4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4)]`. There is no segment at (7, 4). My path is clear.\n- LEFT to (6, 5): **SAFE**. Open space.\n- RIGHT to (8, 5): **DEATH** (Backwards into body).\n\nStrategic Analysis:\n- I am leading 19 to 10.\n- The apple at (7, 4) is directly below me. \n- Snake #0 is at (2, 6), which is 5 units away horizontally. There is no immediate threat of a collision.\n- Grabbing (7, 4) is the most efficient move.\n\nPlan:\nMove DOWN to (7, 4) to collect the apple and continue maintaining my lead.\n\nDOWN",

To my right is my body at (7,3).\n- I must move either UP (6, 4) or DOWN (6, 2).\n- Looking at the board:\n  - If I go DOWN to (6, 2), I move toward (6, 1) and (6, 0). (6, 1) is currently open, but (6, 0) is my body. (5, 2) is also my body. This direction seems a bit cramped.\n  - If I go UP to (6, 4), I move toward the upper half. (6, 5) is open, (5, 4) is my body.\n- The apples are mostly on the left side: (4, 3), (2, 3), (1, 0), (3, 0).\n- However, my body currently occupies the entire column X=5 from Y=0 to Y=4 and also (4, 4) and (3, 4). This forms a wall I must navigate around.\n- By moving UP to (6,4), I can eventually try to loop over the top or find a gap. However, (5,4) is also my body.\n- Let's re-examine DOWN: (6,2). If I go (6,2) -> (7,2) -> (8,2). (7,2) and (8,2) are currently empty. This allows me to move into the open space in the bottom right while my tail (currently at (3,4)) clears out.\n\nWait, looking at the board:\nX=5 is my body from Y=0 to Y=4.\nX=7 is my body at (7,3), (7,4), (7,5).\nThe head is at (6,3).\n(6,2), (6,1) are free. (6,0) is body.\n(6,4), (6,5) are free. (6,6) is free.\n\nThe target apples (4,3) and (2,3) are behind my own \"wall\" at X=5. I need to wait for my tail to move or go around.
