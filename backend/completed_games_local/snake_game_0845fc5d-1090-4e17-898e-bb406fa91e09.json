I would die immediately\n\n**Strategy considerations:**\n- I cannot move DOWN (into my own body) or RIGHT (off the board)\n- Only UP and LEFT are safe moves\n- The apple at (9, 4) is directly above me - moving UP puts me one step closer\n- Moving LEFT would move me away from the apple at (9, 4)\n- The enemy snake is at (8, 4) - it could potentially move toward the apple at (9, 4) or (0, 3)\n- Moving UP to (9, 3) would position me to collect the apple at (9, 4) next turn\n- Moving LEFT to (8, 2) might put me in a better position to block the enemy snake's path to (9, 4)\n- Moving UP is the most direct move for collecting (9, 4) which is right above me\n\n**Decision rationale:**\nMoving UP to (9, 3) is the best move because:\n- It's one of only two safe moves available (DOWN and RIGHT are deadly)\n- It moves me directly toward the apple at (9, 4), which is only one more move away\n- Moving UP positions me to collect the apple at (9, 4) next turn\n- Moving LEFT to (8, 2) would move me away from the apple and potentially put me closer to the enemy snake\n- The enemy snake at (8, 4) could potentially move UP to (8, 5), RIGHT to (9, 4), or DOWN to (8, 3)\n- If the enemy moves RIGHT to (9, 4), we would collide head-on and both die\n- Moving UP maximizes my chance of reaching (9, 4) before the enemy\n- Moving UP maintains my lead and positions me for the next apple\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n1. Move UP to (9, 3) to position for collecting (9, 4) next turn\n2. Next turn, consider moving UP to (9, 4) to collect the apple and extend my lead to 4-2\n3. After collecting (9, 4), consider moving UP to (9, 5) and then to (9, 9) to collect another apple\n4. Continue collecting apples while avoiding head-on collisions and staying alive\n5.

at (6, 8)\n- The enemy snake at (7, 7) could potentially move LEFT to (6, 7) and be at (6, 7)\n- If I move UP to (5, 7), the enemy could move LEFT to (6, 7) and be directly to my right\n- If I move

Moving UP to (5, 7) would put me in a position to potentially block the enemy snake's path to the apple at (6, 8)\n\n**Decision rationale:**\nMoving UP to (5, 7) is the best move because:\n- RIGHT is unsafe (into my own body)\n- UP would move me toward the apple at (6, 8), which is 1 cell above me\n- DOWN and LEFT would move me away from the apple at (6, 8) and toward the apple at (0, 3)\n- The apple at (6, 8) is closest to me and most efficient to reach\n- The apple at (6, 8) is also closest to the enemy snake at (7, 7)\n- Moving UP to (5, 7) would put me directly below the apple at (6, 8)\n- Moving UP to (5, 7) would put me in a potential head-on collision with the enemy snake if it moves LEFT to (6, 7)\n- Moving UP to (5, 7) would put me closer to the apple at (6, 8) and
