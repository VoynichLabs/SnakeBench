Length 1.\n\nApples are at: (4, 4), (6, 2), (8, 6), (9, 9), (5, 9).\n\nMy immediate goal is to safely collect an apple.\n\n1. **Analyze immediate surroundings and potential moves:**\n   My head is at (6, 4).\n\n   *   **UP**: Move to (6, 5). Safe.\n   *   **DOWN**: Move to (6, 3). Safe.\n   *   **LEFT**: Move to (5, 4). Safe.\n   *   **RIGHT**: Move to (7, 4). Safe.\n\n   All moves are safe as I am length 1 and there are no immediate walls or obstacles within one step. I must consider the enemy snake, Snake #0, currently at (5, 0). Snake #0 is quite far away.\n\n2. **Evaluate proximity to apples:**\n   *   Apple A1: (4, 4) - 2 units left/up (L2, U0) relative to (6, 4).\n   *   Apple A2: (6, 2) - 2 units down/same x (D2, X0).\n   *   Apple A3: (8, 6) - 2 units right, 2 units up (R2, U2).\n   *   Apple A4: (9, 9) - Far.\n   *   Apple A5: (5, 9) - Far.\n\n3. **Determine the best direction:**\n\n   *   **Move LEFT to (5, 4):** This moves one step towards Apple (4, 4). Distance to (4, 4) becomes 1.\n   *   **Move UP to (6, 5):** This moves away from (4, 4) and (6, 2). It moves slightly closer to (8, 6).\n   *   **Move DOWN to (6, 3):** This moves one step towards Apple (6, 2). Distance to (6, 2) becomes 1.\n   *   **Move RIGHT to (7, 4):** This moves away from (4, 4) and (6, 2). It moves slightly closer to (8, 6).\n\n   Both LEFT (towards (4, 4)) and DOWN (towards (6, 2)) are strong candidates as they lead directly towards an apple in 1 or 2 turns.\n\n4. **Strategic considerations (Apple Choice):**\n   *   (4, 4) is on the left side of the board.\n   *   (6, 2) is directly below me.\n\n   Let's check for potential enemy interference. Snake #0 is at (5, 0).\n   *   If I go DOWN towards (6, 2), Snake #0 is far away (6 units D, 1 unit R). Snake #0 might head towards the bottom apples, but (6, 2) seems safe from enemy interference for several turns.\n   *   If I go LEFT towards (4, 4), Snake #0 is also far away.\n\n   Since both apples are equally close (2 units away overall), I can pick either.\n   If I choose DOWN, I aim for (6, 2).\n   If I choose LEFT, I aim for (4, 4).\n\n   Let's choose **LEFT** to target (4, 4).\n   Current (6, 4) -> (5, 4). Next turn I can go LEFT again to (4, 4) to eat the apple.\n\n   If I go LEFT to (5, 4):\n   Turn 1: (5, 4)\n   Turn 2: (4, 4) [Eats apple]\n\n   If I go DOWN to (6, 3):\n   Turn 1: (6, 3)\n   Turn 2: (6, 2) [Eats apple]\n\n   Both strategies are sound for maximizing immediate apple acquisition with minimal risk. I will choose LEFT as it brings me closer to the center of the board horizontally, perhaps giving more future options, though the difference is minimal now.\n\n5. **Final check of move LEFT:**\n   Move to (5, 4). Safe from walls and collision. Targets apple (4, 4).\n\nLEFT",

Determine Safe Moves from (5, 4):**\n*   **UP to (5, 5):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN to (5, 3):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 4):** Safe. (This is an apple!)\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 4):** Safe.\n\nNo immediate suicide threats (walls or self-collision).\n\n**2. Analyze collisions and enemy movement:**\nEnemy Snake #0 is at (5, 1).

Evaluate Optimal Move:**\nMoving **LEFT** to (4, 4) immediately collects an apple. This is the optimal move.\n\nIf I move LEFT:\nNew Head: (4, 4).\nLength increases to 2 (if enemy survives and I don't collide).\n\nLet's confirm the enemy's possible moves and their impact on me:\nIf Snake 0 moves UP to (5, 2), I move to (4, 4). No conflict.\nIf Snake 0 moves LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN, even less conflict.\n\nSince moving LEFT results in an immediate apple collection and is perfectly safe, this is the best move.\n\n**Short-term Plan:**\nAfter collecting (4, 4), I will be at (4, 4) (length 2, body segment at (5, 4)).

My body is at (5, 4).\n\n*   **UP to (4, 5):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN to (4, 3):** Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (3, 4):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 4):** **UNSAFE.** This cell is occupied by my body (tail segment).

Manhattan distance = 10.\n\nThe closest apple is (6, 2) at D=4, located generally southeast.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves towards (6, 2):**\n\nTo reach (6, 2), I primarily need to move RIGHT (not allowed this turn) and DOWN.\n\n*   If I move **DOWN** to (4, 3): I decrease the Y distance to (6, 2) by 1. New distance D=3 (2 right, 1 down). This is a good move towards the target *direction*.\n*   If I move **UP** to (4, 5): I increase the Y distance. New distance D=5 (2 right, 3 down). This moves away from (6, 2).\n*   If I move **LEFT** to (3, 4): I increase the X distance to (6, 2). New distance D=5 (3 right, 2 down). This moves away from (6, 2).\n\nMoving DOWN clearly brings me closer to the current nearest objective (6, 2).\n\n**4. Check for Enemy Collision:**\n\nEnemy 0 is at (6, 1).\n\n*   If I move DOWN to (4, 3).\n*   Possible moves for Enemy 0 from (6, 1): (6, 2) [Apple], (5, 1) [Left], (7, 1) [Right], (6, 0) [Down].\n\nIf Enemy 0 moves UP to (6, 2), they eat the apple. This is competition.\n\n*   If I move DOWN to (4, 3), and Enemy 0 moves UP to (6, 2). We are 2 units away. No collision.\n*   If I move DOWN to (4, 3), I am 2 RIGHT and 1 UP from the apple (6, 2).\n\nWe are competing for (6, 2). Snake 0 is currently at (6, 1), 1 step away from the apple (6, 2).\nIf Snake 0 moves UP, they get the apple. Given the proximity and the obvious short path, Snake 0 is highly likely to move UP.\n\n**5. Adjust Objective (If Apple (6, 2) is highly contested):**\n\nIf Snake 0 steals (6, 2), we should pivot to the next best target, which appears to be (7, 7) or (5, 9).\n\n*   **Target (5, 9) D=6:** To reach (5, 9) from (4, 4), move RIGHT (blocked) and UP.\n*   **Target (7, 7) D=6:** To reach (7, 7) from (4, 4), move RIGHT (blocked) and UP.\n\nSince moving RIGHT is currently fatal, we must prioritize moves that set us up for UP or LEFT movement, while allowing us to move RIGHT next turn.\n\n*   Move **UP** to (4, 5): This is a direct path towards (5, 9) (1 right, 4 up) and (7, 7) (3 right, 2 up). It also allows me to move RIGHT to (5, 5) safely in the next turn (Turn 4), setting up a better attack angle for (5, 9) or (7, 7).\n*   Move **LEFT** to (3, 4): Moves further away from all current targets.\n\nWhile DOWN moves me toward the (unlikely to get) (6, 2) apple, it keeps me relatively low on the board.\nMoving UP prepares me for the cluster of apples in the top half of the board (7, 7), (8, 6), (5, 9), (9, 9) and opens up the RIGHT side (5, X) for the next move.\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 5):\nNext turn, my body will be at (4, 4). I can move:\n*   UP (4, 6) -> good for (5, 9) or (7, 7).\n*   DOWN (4, 4) -> forbidden (own body).\n*   LEFT (3, 5).\n*   RIGHT (5, 5) -> good for (5, 9) or (7, 7). (If I move RIGHT to (5, 5), I am only 4 units from (5, 9) and 4 units from (7, 7)).\n\nMoving UP to (4, 5) is strategically better because it sets up favorable positions for the higher apples and avoids moving into the immediate competitive zone of Snake 0.\n\nI choose **UP**.\n\n**Long Term Plan Note (Future Self):**\nI've chosen UP towards (4, 5). Snake 0 is likely taking (6, 2). Next turn (Turn 4), I should aim for the upper right quadrant, specifically (5, 9) or (7, 7). Moving RIGHT (to 5, 5) or continuing UP (to 4, 6) will be the best options.\n\nUP",

(Note: The length should be 2 for 1 apple. Head + Body = 2 segments. Apples collected = 1. Base length is 1 + apples = 2. This confirms my length is 2.)\n\nEnemy Snake (ID 0):\n*   Head: (6, 2)\n*   Body: [(6, 1)]\n*   Apples collected: 1. (Snake 0 likely moved UP from (6, 1) and ate the apple at (6, 2). This means their length is now 2.)\n\nApples remaining: (8, 6), (9, 9), (5, 9), (7, 7), (6, 5). (The apple at (6, 2) is assumed gone and replaced by the new apple at (6, 5) from the board state.)\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves from (4, 5):**\n\nCurrent location: (4, 5).

Analyze Apples and Proximity:**\n\nWe need to target one of the remaining apples: (8, 6), (9, 9), (5, 9), (7, 7), (6, 5). The target priority should be based on Manhattan distance (D) and access.\n\nReference: My Head (4, 5).\n\n*   **Apple A: (6, 5)** (New closest target, likely planted after Snake 0 ate the old (6, 2))\n    *   Distance: D(x) = 2, D(y) = 0.

Evaluate Safe Moves towards (6, 5):**\n\nTo reach (6, 5), I need to move RIGHT twice.\n\n*   If I move **RIGHT** to (5, 5): I decrease the distance D to 1 (1 x RIGHT). This is the most optimal move.\n*   If I move **UP** to (4, 6): I increase the Y distance to (6, 5). New D = 3 (2 x RIGHT, 1 x DOWN).\n*   If I move **LEFT** to (3, 5): I increase the X distance to (6, 5). New D = 3 (3 x RIGHT, 0 x UP/DOWN).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 5) provides the fastest path to (6, 5).\n\n**4. Check for Enemy Collision (Snake 0 at (6, 2)):**\n\nEnemy Snake 0 is at (6, 2), body at (6, 1). They are 3 units away from (6, 5) (0 x RIGHT/LEFT, 3 x UP).\n\n*   If I move RIGHT to (5, 5).\n*   If Snake 0 moves UP to (6, 3). (They are clearly aiming for high Y coordinates, potentially (6, 5) or the high apples).\n\nIf both snakes aim for (6, 5):\n*   I move $S_1$: (4, 5) -> (5, 5). Distance to target: 1 move RIGHT.\n*   Snake 0 moves $S_0$: (6, 2) -> (6, 3) (or 7, 2 or 5, 2).\n\nIf $S_0$ moves UP to (6, 3): They are 2 moves away.\nIf $S_1$ moves RIGHT to (5, 5): I am 1 move away. I should reach it first next turn (Turn 5).\n\nCollision Check (Turn 4 outcome):\nMy head is (5, 5). Snake 0's head can be at (5, 2), (7, 2), or (6, 3). None of these positions collide. Snake 0 cannot reach (5, 5) in one move.\n\n**5. Final Decision:**\nMoving RIGHT directly targets the closest apple (6, 5), minimizes travel distance, and does not pose an immediate risk of head-to-head collision with Snake 0, who is far away horizontally and vertically restricted by their body/tail at (6, 1). This is the greedy and safest move.\n\nRIGHT",

Analyze Enemy Position (6, 4):**\n\nSnake 0 is directly below me.\nPossible moves for Snake 0: UP (to (6, 5)), DOWN (to (6, 3) - tail moves to (6, 2)), LEFT (to (5, 4)), RIGHT (to (7, 4)).\n\n*   If Snake 0 moves UP to (6, 5): Head-on collision. Both die. I must avoid being at (6, 5) next turn, which I am doing by moving. If I move DOWN to (6, 4), and Snake 0 moves UP to (6, 5), nothing bad happens, but that's not possible since I'm trying to move *from* (6, 5).\n*   Since I am at (6, 5), moving DOWN to (6, 4) is directly into Snake 0's head position. This is lethal unless Snake 0 moves away. Since simultaneous moves happen, this is high risk/lethal and already eliminated.\n\nWe need to choose between UP to (6, 6) and RIGHT to (7, 5).\n\n**Comparing UP and RIGHT:**\n\n*(6, 5) -> UP -> (6, 6)*\n\n*   Next apple (8, 6) is 2 moves away.\n*   Moves towards (5, 9) and (9, 9).\n\n*(6, 5) -> RIGHT -> (7, 5)*\n\n*   Next apple (8, 6) is 2 moves away.\n*   Next apple (7, 7) is 2 moves away (UP, UP).\n*   Keeps space between me and Snake 0, which is currently centered vertically.\n\nBoth moves offer similar access to the nearest apple (8, 6). (6, 6) is (2, 0) relative to (8, 6). (7, 5) is (1, 1) relative to (8, 6).\n\nIf I move UP to (6, 6), I block off the vertical path slightly, encouraging Snake 0 to move horizontally or downward.\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 5), I open up space vertically and move toward the cluster of apples on the right side. This also positions me well for the (7, 7) apple.\n\nLet's prioritize the apple (7, 7) because it is slightly closer in Manhattan distance from future positions (if I move (7, 5) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 7) or (7, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (8, 6)).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 5):\nNext turn I can move UP to (7, 6) or RIGHT to (8, 5).\n(7, 7) is reachable in 2 turns (UP, UP) or 3 turns (UP, RIGHT, UP).\n(8, 6) is reachable in 2 turns (RIGHT, UP).\n\nIf I move UP to (6, 6):\nNext turn I can move RIGHT to (7, 6) or UP to (6, 7).\n(8, 6) is reachable in 2 turns (RIGHT, RIGHT).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (7, 5) seems marginally better as it keeps me more centralized and gives good access to (7, 7) and (8, 6). It also moves me away from the enemy snake's current column (x=6).\n\n**Snake 0 Prediction:**\nSnake 0 is at (6, 4). They have no immediately close apples (closest is (7, 7) M(1, 3)=4; (9, 4) M(3, 0)=3). The enemy snake might move LEFT to (5, 4) or RIGHT to (7, 4) to try to gain space/get near an apple (9, 4). If they move UP to (6, 5), they hit my turning tail (5, 5) if they only saw my head move *out* of (6, 5) and didn't realize (6, 5) is empty. Crucially, if I move RIGHT or UP, (6, 5) becomes empty. If Snake 0 moves UP to (6, 5), they eat the tail of my snake which is now at (5, 5). A head moving into an empty cell where my tail *was* is safe.\n\nLet's check the new body layout:\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 5). New head (7, 5). Body (6, 5), (5, 5). Tail vacated (4, 5).\nIf I move UP to (6, 6). New head (6, 6). Body (6, 5), (5, 5). Tail vacated (4, 5).\n\nIn both cases, (6, 5) is protected by my new body segment. (4, 5) is now empty. Snake 0 is at (6, 4). If Snake 0 moves UP to (6, 5), they collide with my body segment. **This is lethal for Snake 0.**\n\nThis means moving UP or RIGHT is safe for me, and potentially traps Snake 0 if they attempt to capitalize on my previous position (6, 5).\n\nSince either move is safe and leads to apples in a similar number of turns, I choose RIGHT to maintain horizontal separation from Snake 0 and open up options towards the right side of the board.\n\nRIGHT",

Determine Safe Moves from (7, 5):**\n\nCurrent location: (7, 5). My body segments are at (6, 5) and (5, 5).\n\n*   **UP to (7, 6):** Safe.\n*   **DOWN to (7, 4):** **UNSAFE.** Occupied by Enemy Head (Snake 0). This is a potential head-on collision or collision with the enemy head (if they move away, I take the spot). Since the enemy is currently there, moving here is high risk. Eliminate.\n*   **LEFT to (6, 5):** **UNSAFE.** Occupied by my body/tail (the first segment behind the head). Eliminate.\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 5):** Safe.\n\nSafe non-lethal moves: UP, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Threats and Opportunities:**\n\n**Threat Assessment:**\nEnemy Snake 0 is at (7, 4).\n\nPossible enemy moves from (7, 4):\n1.  UP to (7, 5): Head-on collision. LETHAL for both. I must move away from (7, 5).\n2.  DOWN to (7, 3): Safe/Neutral.\n3.  LEFT to (6, 4): Safe. (6, 4) is now empty, as Snake 0's body segment (6, 4) will vacate to (6, 3) or (5, 4) depending on the overall move. If Snake 0 moves LEFT, the new head is (6, 4), new body (7, 4). Tail vacated (6, 4). Wait, the body trace for Snake 0 is Head (7, 4), Body [(6, 4)]. If Snake 0 moves LEFT to (6, 4), the body follows to (7, 4). (6, 4) becomes the new head, and (7, 4) becomes the new body segment. The tail at (6, 4) stays for one turn if they don't grow, then frees up the cell behind the previous body segment. Since the previous body segment was (6, 4) itself, moving LEFT would make the new body segment (7, 4). The tail would be released at (6, 4). **Wait, this understanding of the tail is wrong for length 2.** For a snake length L, when it moves and doesn't eat, the cell L-1 is vacated. Snake 0 is L=2, segments (7, 4), (6, 4). If it moves LEFT to (6, 4), the new body is (7, 4). The tail segment (6, 4) *is* the body segment that follows the head. If the head moves to (6, 4), the previous head (7, 4) becomes the new body segment length 2. The *cell* (6, 4) is vacated but simultaneously occupied by the new head. Okay, let's assume standard behavior: the tail frees up the cell it previously occupied.\n    *   If Snake 0 moves LEFT to (6, 4): New body: (6, 4), (7, 4). Tail (6, 4) is where the head is. Length 2 snake: Head (7,4), Body (6,4). Move to (6,4). New head (6,4), new body (7,4). Cell (6,4) is occupied by the new head. (7,4) is occupied by the new body. The tail end *vacates* the space behind the previous body segment, which doesn't exist for L=2, so the cell (6, 4) is vacated, but simultaneously occupied by the head. This move is fine for Snake 0.\n4.  RIGHT to (8, 4): Safe.\n\nSince Snake 0 can move UP to (7, 5), I must move away from (7, 5). Both UP and RIGHT satisfy this.\n\n**Opportunity Assessment (Apples):**\nNearest apples:\n1. (8, 6): Manhattan Distance M(1, 1) = 2.\n2. (7, 7): Manhattan Distance M(0, 2) = 2.\n3. (9, 4): Manhattan Distance M(2, 1) = 3.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves:**\n\n**A. Move UP to (7, 6):**\n*   Directly targets (7, 7) (1 step away).\n*   Also moves towards (8, 6).\n*   If I move UP, I can reach (7, 7) next turn (if Snake 0 moves away, or if it doesn't collide).\n*   If Snake 0 moves (7, 4) -> (7, 5) (head collision), we both die. **CRITICAL ERROR: I am at (7, 5). Moving UP takes me to (7, 6). If Snake 0 moves UP to (7, 5), my previous position, this is safe for me.** (7, 5) becomes empty for Snake 0 to move into. Snake 0 moves onto my previous head location. My body segment at (6, 5) is safe.\n\n**B. Move RIGHT to (8, 5):**\n*   Directly targets (8, 6) (1 step away right, 1 step away up).\n*   Also moves towards (9, 4) and (9, 9).\n*   If I move RIGHT, I can reach (8, 6) in 2 turns (UP, or RIGHT/UP combination).\n\nBoth moves are excellent and move directly towards apples M=2 away.\n\n**Scenario Analysis:**\n\nIf I move UP to (7, 6):\n*   Next target is (7, 7) (1 move UP).\n*   Snake 0 might move RIGHT to (8, 4) or DOWN to (7, 3) or LEFT to (6, 4) or UP to (7, 5).\n*   If Snake 0 moves to (7, 5), they are safely behind me and have a good position to challenge for (7, 7) next turn (M=2 away).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 5):\n*   Next target is (8, 6).\n*   If Snake 0 moves UP to (7, 5), they are safely behind me. They are M=(1, 2)=3 away from (8, 6), and M=(0, 2)=2 away from (7, 7).\n*   (8, 5) also offers good paths to (9, 4).\n\n**Decision:**\nThe apple (7, 7) is currently directly above the enemy head (7, 4), and my head (7, 5) is directly between them.\nMoving UP to (7, 6) prepares me to take (7, 7) on Turn 7. If Snake 0 moves into (7, 5), they are in a blocking position for (7, 7).\n\nIf I move UP: (7, 5) -> (7, 6).\nNext turn possibilities: UP to (7, 7) (EAT), or RIGHT to (8, 6) (1 step towards (8, 6)).\n\nIf I move RIGHT: (7, 5) -> (8, 5).\nNext turn possibilities: UP to (8, 6) (EAT), or RIGHT to (9, 5).\n\nWait, (7, 7) and (8, 6) are both 2 steps away currently.\nMove UP: (7, 6).\n*   (7, 7) is 1 move away.\n*   (8, 6) is 2 moves away (R, then nothing or R, U). (7, 6) -> (8, 6) is 1 move RIGHT, if (8, 6) is occupied by an apple. Yes, (8, 6) is an apple.\nIf I move UP to (7, 6), I can take (7, 7) or (8, 6) on the next turn. This is incorrect.\n(7, 5) -> UP -> (7, 6).\nApple (7, 7) is 1 UP.\nApple (8, 6) is 1 RIGHT.\nBoth apples are reachable in 1 move if I move UP first. This is highly advantageous!\n\nMove RIGHT: (8, 5).\nApple (7, 7) is (1 W, 2 N) = 3 moves.\nApple (8, 6) is 1 UP.\nApple (9, 4) is 1 E, 1 S = 2 moves.\n\nMoving UP to (7, 6) gives me a one-turn opportunity to grab two different apples, (7, 7) and (8, 6), on the next turn (Turn 7).\n\n*(Self-Correction on Turn 5 Rationale: I missed that (8, 6) was 2 moves away if I went RIGHT (7, 5) -> (8, 5). From (7, 5) moving UP to (7, 6) makes (8, 6) only 1 R away, and (7, 7) 1 U away.)* This makes moving UP significantly better than RIGHT.\n\nIf I move UP, I prevent Snake 0 from easily reaching (7, 7) and force them into a horizontal or downward move if they enter (7, 5). If Snake 0 moves (7, 4) -> (7, 5), they are two steps away from both (7, 7) and (8, 6) while I am one step away from both. I retain initiative.\n\n**Conclusion:** Move UP to (7, 6) to position myself optimally for grabbing either (7, 7) or (8, 6) in the next turn.\n\nUP",

It is ideal to take one of them now.\n\n| Move | New Head | Target Apple | Enemy Threat Response |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| UP | (7, 7) | (7, 7) EAT | Snake 0 potentially moves (8, 4) -> (8, 5) (1 step towards (8, 6)). |\n| RIGHT | (8, 6) | (8, 6) EAT | Snake 0 potentially moves (8, 4) -> (8, 5) (1 step towards (8, 6)). |\n| LEFT | (6, 6) | None | Allows Snake 0 closer to both apples. |\n\nLet's compare UP vs RIGHT.\n\n**A. Move UP to (7, 7) (EAT):**\n*   I become length 4: (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5).\n*   I claim the (7, 7) apple.\n*   Next turn, I am at (7, 7). (8, 6) is M(1, 1) = 2 steps away.\n*   I position myself high on the board.\n\n**B. Move RIGHT to (8, 6) (EAT):**\n*   I become length 4: (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5).\n*   I claim the (8, 6) apple.\n*   Next turn, I am at (8, 6). (7, 7) is M(1, 1) = 2 steps away.\n*   I position myself further right on the board, closer to (9, 9) and (9, 4).\n\nBoth moves are excellent. Let's see how Snake 0 might respond.\n\nSnake 0 is at (8, 4). (8, 6) is 2 UP. (7, 7) is 1 LEFT, 3 UP (M=4).\nSnake 0 is definitely better positioned to contest (8, 6) than (7, 7). If I take (8, 6), Snake 0 might move UP to (8, 5), bringing them closer to (8, 6) (now gone), and potentially setting them up for (9, 4) or chasing me.\n\nIf I take (7, 7): The enemy is still 4 steps away. They are likely to move (8, 4) -> (8, 5) to claim the vertical space and try to contest (8, 6) or (9, 9).\n\nIf I take (8, 6): The enemy is likely to move (8, 4) -> (8, 5) to claim the vertical space close to the action. They are also only 1 step away from the (9, 4) apple if they move RIGHT.\n\nWe need to consider the relative positions to remaining attractive apples: (5, 9) and (9, 9).\nFrom (7, 7) (UP move):\n*   (9, 9): M(2, 2) = 4 steps. (R, R, U, U) or (U, U, R, R).\n*   (5, 9): M(2, 2) = 4 steps. (L, L, U, U) or (U, U, L, L).\n\nFrom (8, 6) (RIGHT move):\n*   (9, 9): M(1, 3) = 4 steps. (R, U, U, U) or (U, U, U, R).\n*   (5, 9): M(3, 3) = 6 steps.\n\nSince I am aiming for maximizing points, taking either apple is a priority. Taking (7, 7) seems slightly better as it keeps me central and equidistant from the top corner apples (9, 9) and (5, 9). This opens up more options for future movement and pathing.\n\nIf I choose UP, and Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (9, 4) (EAT), they will grow toward the right edge. If they move UP to (8, 5), they position themselves well for the remaining apples.\n\nGiven the superior position relative to the remaining map, especially the clustered apples (5, 9) and (9, 9), moving UP to (7, 7) is marginally better.\n\n**3. Head-On Collision Check (Advanced):**\nMy move UP to (7, 7), or RIGHT to (8, 6).\nEnemy is at (8, 4).\nNo immediate risk of head-on collision.\n\n**4. Final Decision:** Take the (7, 7) apple to maintain central control and balance access to the remaining high-value apples.\n\n**--Short/Long-Term Plan--**\nHaving secured (7, 7), I am now at (7, 7). (8, 6) is 2 steps away, and (9, 9)/(5, 9) are 4 steps away. If Snake 0 moves to (8, 5), they are 1 step from (8, 6) and could take it next. If (8, 6) is still available, I should move RIGHT towards it next (Turn 8: (7, 7) -> (8, 7) or (7, 7) -> (6, 7)). If Snake 0 is at (8, 5), I should move strategically to keep them boxed out or pivot towards the corner apples (5, 9) and (9, 9). If Snake 0 takes (9, 4), move towards (8, 6) if free, or (9, 9).\n\nUP",

None can contest (9,4) this turn.\n\nChoice rationale: RIGHT to (9,4) \u2014 it safely picks the nearby apple immediately and there is no immediate head-on threat. After eating I will have only UP or DOWN available from (9,4), so I must take care next turn to keep escape room (avoid getting funneled along the right edge). If the enemy heads for (8,6)/(7,7), I'll avoid direct confrontations and try to approach the remaining apple cluster from a safe angle while keeping my tail/escapes open.\n\nShort-term plan (for next few turns): take the apple at (9,4) now. On the following turn, choose UP or DOWN depending on enemy movement to preserve space. Then pivot toward the nearby apples (8,6)/(7,7) if safe, otherwise seek the farther apples (5,9)/(9,9) while avoiding head-on collisions.\n\nRIGHT",

If Snake 0 moves UP to (9, 5), they are 1 step away from (8, 5) and 2 steps away from (8, 6). Wait, Snake 0 is at (9, 4). If they move UP to (9, 5), they are 1 step from (9, 6) and 2 steps from (8, 6) (via L). If they move UP to (9, 5), I am at (8, 7). No collision risk.\n\n**Evaluation of UP to (7, 8):**\n*   New Head: (7, 8).\n*   (8, 6) is 3 steps away.

Determine Safe Moves from (8, 6):**\n\nCurrent location: (8, 6). Body segments are at (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5).\n\n*   **UP to (8, 7):** UNSAFE. Occupied by the first body segment. (Moving backwards). Eliminate.\n*   **DOWN to (8, 5):** DANGER! This is the enemy's current head position. Head-on collision risk if the enemy stands still (which is impossible) or if the enemy moves into (8, 5) which is its current location (which is impossible). Since the enemy is at (8, 5), moving DOWN hits the enemy head location, meaning we will collide unless the enemy moves out. We must anticipate the enemy's move.\n*   **LEFT to (7, 6):** UNSAFE. Occupied by a body segment. Eliminate.\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 6):** Safe.\n\nSafe moves: Potentially RIGHT, and potentially DOWN/LEFT/UP if the collision risk is resolved by enemy movement.\n\nLet's re-evaluate all cardinal directions, considering potential enemy collision:\n\n*   **UP to (8, 7):** Collision with my own body (8, 7). Kill. (Eliminated)\n*   **LEFT to (7, 6):** Collision with my own body (7, 6). Kill. (Eliminated)\n*   **DOWN to (8, 5):** Currently occupied by Enemy Head (0). If Enemy 0 moves out of (8, 5), this cell is safe.\n    *   Enemy (8, 5) Safe moves: UP (8, 6), DOWN (8, 4), LEFT (7, 5), RIGHT (9, 5).\n    *   If Enemy moves: DOWN (8, 4), LEFT (7, 5), or RIGHT (9, 5), then (8, 5) is open for me.\n    *   If Enemy moves UP to (8, 6), this is a Head-on collision! Both die.\n\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 6):** Safe from own body and board edges. We need to check for enemy collision.\n    *   Can Enemy 0 (at 8, 5) reach (9, 6)? Enemy 0 needs to move RIGHT to (9, 5), then UP/RIGHT/LEFT/DOWN from there. No, they can't reach (9, 6) in one turn. Safe from all enemy collision.\n\nCurrently, **RIGHT (9, 6)** is the only move immediately guaranteed safe from self and enemy collision.\n\n**2. Evaluate Collision Risk for DOWN to (8, 5):**\n\nMy movement: (8, 6) -> (8, 5).\nEnemy 0 movement: (8, 5) -> N.\n\nEnemy 0 must choose one of the following safe moves:\n1. UP to (8, 6): Head-on collision! Both die. (This is my current position.)\n2. DOWN to (8, 4): Safe. (Apple at (5, 4) is far, but (8, 4) is not part of my body.)\n3. LEFT to (7, 5): DANGER! (7, 5) is my tail segment. If I move DOWN to (8, 5), my body shifts, and (7, 5) becomes free. If I move RIGHT to (9, 6), my tail (7, 5) stays. Since I am prioritizing avoidance of head-on collisions, I will assume the enemy wants to maximize its chances of surviving too.\n4. RIGHT to (9, 5): Safe. (Hits Enemy's own body segment (9, 5) if they only move their body, but since their body is (9, 5), (9, 4), they will move out of (9, 5) and grow from (9, 4) if they ate an apple, which they did not in T9. No, their body starts at (9, 5) then (9, 4). If they move RIGHT (9, 6) -> (10, 6) -> (9, 5). Wait, Enemy body: [(9, 5), (9, 4)]. If Enemy 0 moves RIGHT from (8, 5) to (9, 5), they hit their own body. This move is UNSAFE for the enemy. T9 movement: (9, 5) -> (8, 5). Body: (9, 5), (9, 4). New body: (9, 5) becomes the new body head segment, but the tail released (8, 4) is wrong, the tail remains (9, 4) if no apple, or it shifts.\nReviewing Enemy State: Head: (8, 5), Body: (9, 5), (9, 4).\nIf Enemy 0 moves RIGHT to (9, 5), it hits its own existing body segment (9, 5). **RIGHT is an immediate self-collision for Enemy 0.**\n\nEnemy 0 safe moves are: UP (8, 6), DOWN (8, 4), LEFT (7, 5).\n\n*   If Enemy 0 moves UP (8, 6): Head-on collision with me. Both die.\n*   If Enemy 0 moves DOWN (8, 4): I can move DOWN (8, 5) safely.\n*   If Enemy 0 moves LEFT (7, 5): I can move DOWN (8, 5) safely.\n\nSince there is a 1/3 chance of immediate mutual death if I choose DOWN, I will eliminate DOWN as a primary option.\n\n**3. Decision: RIGHT to (9, 6)**\n\nThe move RIGHT to (9, 6) is guaranteed safe.\n\n*   My Head (8, 6) -> (9, 6).\n*   My Body: (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5).\n\nWhat does this accomplish?\nIt moves me along the boundary, positioned well for the apple at (9, 9) (3 Manhattan steps away), but also slightly away from the cluster of central/left apples (5, 9), (5, 5), (5, 4).\n\nIf I move RIGHT (9, 6), where does the enemy go?\nThe enemy must avoid (8, 6) (my current location) and (7, 5) (my tail, which will be released if I move RIGHT and don't eat an apple).\n1. UP to (8, 6): Now safe for the enemy! Since I moved out of (8, 6). This is a strong likelihood, as it moves them towards the high apples (9, 9) and (5, 9).\n2. DOWN to (8, 4): Safe. Moves them towards (7, 1) or (5, 4).\n3. LEFT to (7, 5): Safe. Tail is released to (7, 5) if I moved RIGHT (no apple).\n\nIf I move RIGHT, the enemy is likely to move UP to (8, 6), taking my recent apple location, to pursue (9, 9).\n\n**4. Considering Alternative: Left-Side Apples**\n\nThe apples (5, 9), (5, 5), (5, 4), (7, 1) are grouped on the left/center/bottom. The apple (9, 9) is isolated top right.\n\nIf I aim for (5, 5) (Manhattan 4 steps: 3 left, 1 down), I should move LEFT or DOWN. Since LEFT and DOWN are currently blocked/risky, I must first move to a safe position to pivot.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 6), my position for (5, 5) becomes worse. (4 left, 1 down) = 5 steps.\n\nIf I move UP to (8, 7), I hit my body.\n\nThe optimal long term strategy is likely to clear the central apples (5, 5) and (5, 4) before the enemy snake does, giving me more control over the board center. However, I cannot take a 33% self-kill risk.\n\nTherefore, the only safe move is RIGHT. This forces me towards (9, 9) or a general high position, which is still a decent area for scoring.\n\n**--Short/Long-Term Plan--**\nT10: Move RIGHT to (9, 6). This is the only guaranteed safe move. Enemy will likely occupy (8, 6) or (8, 4).\nT11: If I am at (9, 6), I am 3 steps from (9, 9). I will prioritize moving UP or LEFT/DOWN to avoid being cornered if the enemy comes after me, or to take (9, 9). If the enemy moves to (8, 6), pursuing (9, 9) is slightly favorable for me.\n\nRIGHT",

Strategic Evaluation of UP (9, 8):**\n\n*   **Move:** (9, 7) -> (9, 8).\n*   **Objective:** This move puts me one step away from the apple at (9, 9).\n*   **Distance to closest apple:** (9, 9) is 1 step (UP).\n*   **Enemy Position:** Enemy 0 is at (7, 4) and is likely targeting (5, 4), (5, 5), or (7, 1). They are far from the top right corner.\n\nThis move is excellent, securing an apple one turn sooner than any other available apple.\n\n**4. Future Plan:**\nT13: Move UP to (9, 9) (Eat apple, grow to length 6, score 5).\nAfter that, I will assess whether to approach (5, 9) or pivot towards the center (5, 5).\n\n**--Short/Long-Term Plan--**\nThe move sequence is forced to achieve the apple at (9, 9). T12: UP to (9, 8). T13: UP to (9, 9) to capture the apple. Following the capture, I will evaluate the path to (5, 9) or (5, 5), depending on Enemy 0's position.\n\nUP",

Eliminate.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN ((8, 8)) and LEFT ((7, 9)).\n\n**2. Collision and Strategic Risk Check:**\n\nI am targeting the apple at (5, 9) or (3, 8). Moving LEFT continues the planned approach towards the high-density apple area on the left side of the board.\n\nEnemy 0 Head: (5, 5). Possible moves for Enemy 0:\n1. UP to (5, 6)\n2. DOWN to (5, 4) (Snake 0's body is at (5, 4), but since it grew, this is safe if the tail (8, 4) moves away. Ah, wait. Snake 0's body is [(5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4)]. Since it just ate, its tail (8, 4) will *not* move this turn. So moving to (5, 4) is hitting its second segment, (5, 4). **UNSAFE if it moves to (5, 4)**).\n3. LEFT to (4, 5)\n4. RIGHT to (6, 5)\n\nEnemy 0 is too far away to pose an immediate head-on collision or cut-off threat for (8, 9).\n\n**Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (7, 9):**\n    *   Distance to (5, 9): 2 steps (7, 9) -> (6, 9) -> (5, 9).\n    *   This is the most direct path to the closest apple, (5, 9).\n    *   This keeps me far away from Enemy 0, who is operating in the middle/bottom of the board.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (8, 8):**\n    *   This move takes me away from the target apple (5, 9) and potentially leads to a dead-end near my own body segments (9, 8), (9, 7), etc., effectively trapping me in the top right corner.\n    *   Distance to (5, 9): 1 (8, 8) -> 3+ steps (e.g., (8, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (5, 9)). Worse path than going left directly.\n\nThe priority is to maintain forward progress towards the nearest cluster of apples, which is achieved by moving LEFT.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving LEFT to (7, 9) is safe, efficient, and aligns with the strategy of collecting (5, 9) next.\n\n**--Short/Long-Term Plan--**\nT15: Move LEFT to (7, 9). (Current turn)\nT16: Move LEFT to (6, 9).\nT17: Move LEFT to (5, 9) and eat the apple.\n\nIf successful, I will monitor Snake 0's position relative to apples (3, 8), (4, 3), (7, 1), and (4, 1). I will aim for (3, 8) next.\n\nLEFT",

Wait, the previous body was [(9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6)]. After moving LEFT from (8, 9) to (7, 9), the new body is the old head (8, 9) + the rest of the old body, excluding the tail (8, 6). So the new body is [(8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6)]. Correct.)\n\nEnemy Snake (ID 0):\n*   Head: (5, 6)\n*   Body: [(5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4)]\n*   Apples collected: 4.

Off the board edge (y=10). Eliminate.\n*   **DOWN to (7, 8):** Safe. Empty space.\n*   **LEFT to (6, 9):** Safe. Empty space. (This is the path to (5, 9)).\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 9):** UNSAFE. Occupied by my first body segment. Eliminate.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN ((7, 8)) and LEFT ((6, 9)).\n\n**3. Evaluate Competitive Threat (Enemy 0):**\nEnemy 0 Head is at (5, 6).\nPossible moves for Enemy 0:\n1. UP to (5, 7)\n2. DOWN to (5, 5) (Body segment (5, 5). Unsafe, unless snake 0 shrinks, but it didn't eat last turn.) Wait, Snake 0's body is [(5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4)]. It *moved* from a previous position to (5, 6). If it moved from (5, 5) to (5, 6) this turn, its body would be based on the head position *before* this turn.\n*Revisiting Turn 15 end state:* Enemy 0 Head: (5, 5), Body: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4)].\n*If Enemy 0 moved UP from (5, 5) to (5, 6) this turn (Turn 16),* its new body is the old head (5, 5) + the rest of the old body, excluding the tail (8, 4). New Body: [(5, 5), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4)]. This matches the current state description.\nSo, if Enemy 0 tries to move DOWN to (5, 5) this turn (T16), it will hit its own body segment (5, 5). **Therefore, DOWN is unsafe for Snake 0.**\n\nSafe moves for Snake 0 from (5, 6):\n*   UP to (5, 7) - Heading toward A(5, 9) or A(3, 8). This is the biggest threat.\n*   LEFT to (4, 6) - Heading toward A(3, 8).\n*   RIGHT to (6, 6)\n*   (DOWN to (5, 5) is self-collision).\n\nIf Enemy 0 moves UP to (5, 7) or LEFT to (4, 6), they are making progress towards the northern apples, including (5, 9).\n\n**4. Move Evaluation (My Snake, ID 1):**\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 9):**\n    *   This is the optimal apple path. The next move will be to (5, 9) to eat the apple.\n    *   If Enemy 0 moves to (5, 7), they are still far from (5, 9). I will get there first.\n    *   The path (7, 9) -> (6, 9) -> (5, 9) is clear of my body and board edges.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (7, 8):**\n    *   This moves me away from (5, 9) and closer to my own trapped corner structure.\n    *   It delays reaching any apple.\n\n**Collision Check (Head-on at (6, 8)):**\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 9), and S0 moves to (6, 8) or (5, 8), there is no immediate threat of head-on collision. The closest S0 can get to (6, 9) is (6, 8) or (5, 7) or (4, 6).\n\nIf S0 moves UP to (5, 7) and I move LEFT to (6, 9), I still maintain priority for (5, 9). If S0 moves to (4, 6), they are prioritizing (3, 8).\n\nMoving **LEFT** is the best choice to secure the apple at (5, 9).\n\n**--Short/Long-Term Plan--**\nT16: Move LEFT to (6, 9).\nT17: Move LEFT to (5, 9) and collect the apple.\nT18: After eating (5, 9), I will be at (5, 9). The next most appealing apple is (3, 8). I will plan to move DOWN/LEFT towards (3, 8) or depending on Snake 0's position, cut across the board. The general direction will be towards (4, 8) or (5, 8).\n\nLEFT",

Moves towards (3, 8).\n*   RIGHT to (6, 7): Clear.\n\nEnemy 0 is likely aiming for (5, 9) or (3, 8). If Enemy 0 moves UP to (5, 8), they will be one step away from (5, 9).\n\n**4. Move Evaluation (My Snake, ID 1):**\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (5, 9):** This is the optimal move. I collect the apple, increase my lead, and increase my length to 7.\n    *   *Collision Check:* The enemy head is at (5, 7). Even if they move UP to (5, 8), there is no head-on collision at (5, 9) or along the path. I secure the apple.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (6, 8):** This delays the appetite and increases the chance Enemy 0 gets (5, 9) if they move (5, 7) -> (5, 8) -> (5, 9). This is suboptimal.\n\n**Conclusion for Turn 17:** Move LEFT to collect the apple at (5, 9).\n\n**--Short/Long-Term Plan--**\nT17: Move LEFT to (5, 9). Collect apple. New Head: (5, 9). New Length: 7.\nT18: After eating, the next closest apple is (3, 8) (2 moves away) or (4, 3) (6 moves away) or (7, 1) (8 moves away).\nSince I will be at (5, 9), I should aim for (3, 8).\nPossible paths: (5, 9) -> (5, 8) -> (4, 8) -> (3, 8) or (5, 9) -> (4, 9) -> (3, 9) -> (3, 8).\nThe most direct path toward (3, 8) is usually optimal, but I must monitor Snake 0's position. Snake 0 will likely be at (5, 8) or (4, 7) this turn (T17), putting them in position to contest (3, 8).\nMy strategic move will be to move DOWN toward (5, 8) or (4, 8) to secure space and move toward the next apple. I must be wary of Snake 0 blocking the (5, 8) or (4, 8) positions.\n\nLEFT",

Also viable but edges me toward the right; no immediate benefit over UP.\n- DOWN -> (5,6): illegal (would move into my neck).\n\nRisk assessment:\n- Enemy head is at (6,9). They can take (5,9) in one move (LEFT) while I need two moves, so I likely won\u2019t get (5,9) first if they commit to it. There\u2019s a small risk of future head-on collisions if we both try to contest the same cell, but moving UP now keeps options open and does not create an immediate head-on.\n- No immediate body collisions or board-edge risk from moving UP. Moving LEFT or RIGHT are also safe but less direct toward high-value nearby apples.\n\nShort-term plan:\n- Move UP to (5,8) to continue toward the high-value apple at (5,9). If the opponent takes (5,9) or aggressively contests it, pivot toward (3,8) (via LEFT moves) or drop south to (4,3)/(4,1) later so I don\u2019t get trapped.\n- Maintain at least two escape options after the next move (avoid hugging the board edge or my own body).\n\nUP",

Determine Safe Moves from (5, 9):**\nCurrent Head: (5, 9).\n\n*   **UP to (5, 10):** UNSAFE. Off the board (y=10).\n*   **DOWN to (5, 8):** Potential COLLISION/BLOCKAGE.

If they move here, they die hitting my head, or I move away (LEFT or RIGHT -- but RIGHT is blocked) and they hit my body/tail remains (depending on how I move/if they grow).\n*   DOWN to (5, 7): UNSAFE. Snake 0 body segment.\n*   LEFT to (4, 8): Safe. Moves toward (3, 8).\n*   RIGHT to (6, 8): Safe.\n\nSince (5, 8) is my previous move target, and moving DOWN is a head-on collision, I must choose LEFT (4, 9).\n\n**4. Move Evaluation (My Snake, ID 1):**\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (4, 9):** This is the only safe, non-suicidal move. It moves me closer to (3, 8) (now D=2: (4, 9) -> (4, 8) -> (3, 8) or (4, 9) -> (3, 9) -> (3, 8)).\n    *   If Enemy 0 moves LEFT to (4, 8), they are one step away from (3, 8).\n    *   If Enemy 0 moves RIGHT to (6, 8), they move away from (3, 8).\n    *   If Enemy 0 moves UP to (5, 9), they die hitting me/my previous spot.\n\nBy moving LEFT to (4, 9), I position myself to make a subsequent move DOWN to (4, 8) or LEFT to (3, 9). Both keep me in contention for the apple at (3, 8).\n\n**5. Secondary Consideration (Avoiding Traps):**\n(4, 9) is not a tight space, and it allows me to move in three directions next turn (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). This is a good maneuvering position given the constraint of the board edge and my own body.\n\n**Conclusion for Turn 18:** Move LEFT to (4, 9).\n\n**--Short/Long-Term Plan (T19 onwards)--**\nT18: Move LEFT to (4, 9).\nIf Enemy 0 moved to (4, 8), they are one step from (3, 8). I may need to abandon (3, 8) or try to cut them off.\nIf Enemy 0 moved to (6, 8) or (5, 9), I have a clear path.\n\nAssuming Enemy 0 moved to (4, 8) (the smartest move for them):\nT19: I am at (4, 9). I must choose between moving DOWN to (4, 8) (head-on collision, not good) or LEFT to (3, 9).\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 9), I am one step away from (3, 8). If Enemy 0 eats (3, 8), I must decide on the next apple (4, 3) or (4, 1).\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 9), I improve my overall position and stay close to (3, 8). This seems safe and keeps options open.\n\nMy immediate priority is to get off the top wall and move into the open board area.\n\nLEFT",

My distance to (3,8) is 2; enemy head at (5,9) has distance 3, so I can reach that apple before they can reliably contest it.\n\nRisk assessment:\n- LEFT avoids direct conflict with the enemy head at (5,9) and moves toward a reachable apple at (3,8).\n- LEFT keeps multiple escape options (after moving to 4,8 I can go to 3,8 for the apple or pivot back/right/down as needed) and does not trap me against my own body or the board edge.\n- UP is unnecessary risk; RIGHT is safe but inferior for apple capture.\n\nShort-term plan / next few turns:\n- Move LEFT now to approach (3,8).

(0% survival)\n    *   If Enemy 0 moves LEFT (3, 8): I hit their tail location (4, 8) after they move, which is now safe (unless 4, 8 is part of my body which it is not, or their body which it is not). I occupy (4, 8). Enemy gets the apple. (100% survival, Enemy gets apple)\n    *   If Enemy 0 moves DOWN (4, 7): I occupy (4, 8). (100% survival)\n\n2.  **I move LEFT (3, 9):**\n    *   If Enemy 0 moves UP (4, 9): Enemy 0 dies hitting my previous location (4, 9). I am safe at (3, 9). (100% survival, Enemy dies)\n    *   If Enemy 0 moves LEFT (3, 8): Enemy 0 gets apple. I am safe at (3, 9). (100% survival, Enemy gets apple)\n    *   If Enemy 0 moves DOWN (4, 7): I am safe at (3, 9). (100% survival)\n\n**Decision based on collision risk and objective:**\n\nSince the target apple (3, 8) is so critical, Enemy 0 is highly incentivized to move LEFT to (3, 8).\n\n*   If Enemy 0 moves LEFT to (3, 8) (most likely move):\n    *   If I move DOWN to (4, 8): Safe, but I let Enemy 0 get the lead apple.\n    *   If I move LEFT to (3, 9): Safe, but I let Enemy 0 get the lead apple.\n\nMoving DOWN to (4, 8) puts me in a better position to head towards the next closest apples (e.g., (4, 3) or (4, 1)) if (3, 8) is taken, and also prevents Enemy 0 from potentially moving onto (4, 8) and trapping me in the top corner (highly unlikely since (5,8) is their body).\n\nHowever, moving LEFT to (3, 9) is strategically superior as it avoids the high-risk scenario where the enemy tries to counter-block me by moving UP to (4, 9), resulting in a mutual death. Enemy 0 dying from hitting my head at (4, 9) is a definite win for me, as I survive. While moving LEFT doesn't guarantee the apple, it guarantees survival and sets me up for a quick move to (3, 8) if the enemy goes DOWN/UP.\n\nIf Enemy 0 moves *aggressively* (UP to (4, 9)), mutual death means enemy is prioritizing eliminating me over eating. I must assume the optimal move for Enemy 0 is to eat the apple at (3, 8).\n\nThe immediate goal is survival and positioning for the next best apple if (3, 8) is lost.\nMove LEFT to (3, 9):\n1. Safest move regarding mutual head-on collision (only risk is if Enemy 0 commits suicide by moving UP).\n2. Sets me up to move DOWN to (3, 8) next turn if Enemy 0 moves away (e.g., to (4, 7) or if they moved to (4, 9) and died).\n3. If Enemy 0 takes (3, 8), position at (3, 9) still allows pathing DOWN/RIGHT/LEFT towards the next central targets (4, 3) or (4, 1).\n\n**4. Long-Term Plan:**\nT19: Move LEFT to (3, 9). (Secures survival, puts me adjacent to target (3, 8)).\nIf A2 (3, 8) is taken by Enemy 0, my next target will be A3 (4, 3) or A4 (4, 1). I will likely path down the 3-column or 4-column.\n\nLEFT",

This confirms my hypothesis (T19 Rationale) that Enemy 0 would move LEFT to take the apple (3, 8). Enemy 0 has successfully eaten A2.\n\n**Apples Remaining:**\nA1: (7, 1)\nA3: (4, 3)\nA4: (4, 1)\nA5: (8, 2)\nA6: (2, 2)\n\n**Distances from My Head (3, 9):**\n* A3 (4, 3): D = 1 + 6 = 7 (Closest central target)\n* A6 (2, 2): D = 1 + 7 = 8\n* A4 (4, 1): D = 1 + 8 = 9\n* A5 (8, 2): D = 5 + 7 = 12\n* A1 (7, 1): D = 4 + 8 = 12\n\n**Distances from Enemy Head (3, 8):**\n* A6 (2, 2): D = 1 + 6 = 7\n* A3 (4, 3): D = 1 + 5 = 6 (Closest target for Enemy 0)\n* A4 (4, 1): D = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nEnemy 0 is slightly closer to A3 (4, 3). My advantage is currently nullified by the proximity of Enemy 0. I need to move quickly and decisively toward my next target.\n\n**1. Determine Safe Moves from (3, 9):**\nCurrent Head: (3, 9).\n\n*   **UP to (3, 10):** UNSAFE. Off the board (y=10).\n*   **DOWN to (3, 8):** Potential COLLISION. Enemy 0 Head is at (3, 8). If I move DOWN, it's a head-on collision, and both snakes die. UNSAFE.\n*   **LEFT to (2, 9):** Safe. Empty space.\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 9):** UNSAFE. My body segment (4, 9).\n\nOnly one guaranteed safe move: LEFT to (2, 9).\n\n**2. Evaluate Strategic Moves:**\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 9):\nI avoid the instant death collision with Snake 0 at (3, 8).\nThis move puts me on the column x=2, which is good for targeting A6 (2, 2).\n\nIf Enemy 0 moves:\nEnemy 0 is at (3, 8).\n*   UP to (3, 9): Collision with my head. Both die. Highly unlikely unless Enemy 0 is suicidally aggressive.\n*   DOWN to (3, 7): Safe. Moves away from me, and closer to A6 (2, 2) or A3 (4, 3).\n*   LEFT to (2, 8): Safe. Closer to A6 (2, 2).\n*   RIGHT to (4, 8): UNSAFE. Enemy body at (4, 8).\n\nSnake 0 is likely to move DOWN to (3, 7) or LEFT to (2, 8) to secure the next closest apples, A3 or A6. A3 is D=6, A6 is D=7.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 9), I am safe.\nNext turn (T21), I would be at (2, 9).\nIf Enemy 0 moves DOWN to (3, 7).\nI can then move DOWN to (2, 8) (D=1), then DOWN to (2, 7) (D=2), etc., or RIGHT to (3, 9) if safe, or DOWN/RIGHT toward A6 or A3.\n\n**3. Decision:**\nThe only immediately safe move is LEFT. Moving LEFT focuses me slightly more on A6 (2, 2) and keeps me safe from immediate collision. It also avoids being cornered in (3, 9) if Snake 0 tried a risky move to (3, 9) and died (though this would only free up (3, 9) next turn).\n\nTarget A6 (2, 2) is a strong option after losing (3, 8).\n\nCurrent Plan:\nT20: Move LEFT to (2, 9).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T21+):**\nFrom (2, 9), maneuver downwards along column 2 towards Apple A6 (2, 2). If Enemy 0 takes A6, pivot right towards the central apples A3 (4, 3) or A4 (4, 1).\n\nLEFT",

Because moves are simultaneous, the enemy must move off that square (they can go LEFT to (2,9) or DOWN to (3,8)). That makes UP possible, but it is risky: moving onto their head puts us on the top row near their long body and invites contention for space; it reduces our mobility and could allow them to pressure/trap us on the edge.\n- LEFT -> (2,8) is safe and moves toward the apple column x=2, but it's farther from the closest apple cluster and doesn't advance toward the nearby apples around x=4.\n- DOWN -> (3,7) is safe, moves us toward the cluster of apples at (4,3)/(4,1), and keeps several escape options (left/right/down). It also increases the likelihood we can reach the nearest apple (4,3) sooner while staying away from the enemy at the top row.\n\nEnemy considerations:\n- Enemy at (3,9) can only go LEFT (2,9) or DOWN (3,8). Either is manageable; going DOWN into our current cell is possible but harmless if we move down ourselves (they'll occupy our vacated cell). I prefer to avoid trading space on the top edge where their long horizontal body gives them control.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Move DOWN to head toward the apple cluster at x=4, then navigate to (4,3) and (4,1) to close the gap in apples.\n- Keep lateral mobility (avoid hugging the top edge or their long body), avoid going into contested head-space with the enemy, and only contest apples when I can do so without risking a head-on or getting boxed in.\n\nDOWN",

Evaluate Strategic Moves (Closest Apple A_2_2 (2, 2)):**\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (2, 8):**\n    *   This is the direct path toward A_2_2 (2, 2).\n    *   Leads to A_2_2 in 6 more moves.\n    *   Keeps me on the left side, away from Enemy 0 who is currently at (3, 7).\n    *   Enemy 0 is likely to move RIGHT to (4, 7) or DOWN to (3, 6) to reach A_4_3 (4, 3). If Enemy 0 goes RIGHT to (4, 7), it is 2 squares away (x=2 to x=4) from me. If Enemy 0 goes DOWN to (3, 6), it maintains separation.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (1, 9):**\n    *   This delays progress toward any central apple. It's a deflection move.\n    *   It may be useful if the path down the center is blocked later, but for now, the vertical path is clear.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (3, 9):**\n    *   This moves me adjacent to Enemy 0's anticipated area of movement (columns 3 and 4).\n    *   If Enemy 0 moves DOWN to (3, 6), I can move DOWN/RIGHT towards A_4_3, but Enemy 0 has a 3-turn lead on that apple assuming clear paths.\n    *   If Enemy 0 moves RIGHT to (4, 7), then I am adjacent at (3, 9) and could pivot to (3, 8) or (4, 9) next turn, but this increases collision risk and seems less focused than going for A_2_2.\n\n**3. Decision:**\nThe best move is DOWN to (2, 8). This maintains the direct line of sight to A_2_2 (2, 2) and keeps me separated from Enemy 0, who is focused on the area around (4, 3).\n\n**Confirming Safety of DOWN:**\nMove to (2, 8).\n1.

DOWN moves me directly toward the nearest apple at (4,3) (and then (4,1)) and keeps multiple follow-up options (I can continue down to get the apple, or sidestep left/right if the enemy approaches). LEFT or RIGHT do not give a more immediate apple and could steer me away from the easy vertical apple line.\n- Staying on the x=4 column toward (4,3) is the quickest way to pick up an apple and increase apples to close the gap with snake #1.

RIGHT to (5, 5): Safe.\n\nIf I move to (2, 5):\n*   Head collision risk: My new head (2, 5) is far from the enemy's possible positions ((4, 4), (3, 5), (5, 5)). No risk.\n*   Body collision risk: The enemy's new body will occupy one of the safe spaces listed above. None of those spaces overlap with (2, 5).\n\nDOWN is the optimal and safe move.\n\n**4. Long-Term Plan (T25+):**\nContinue DOWN along x=2 toward A5 (2, 2).\nT25: (2, 4)\nT26: (2, 3)\nT27: (2, 2) (Eat!)\nEnemy 0 is likely to eat A2 (4, 3) around T26/T27.

Empty space.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Evaluate Strategic Moves:**\n\n*   **Option 1: Move DOWN to (2, 3).**\n    *   This continues the path toward A5 (2, 2). We will eat A5 next turn (T27).\n    *   This maintains positional advantage relative to Enemy 0 for A5.\n\n*   **Option 2: Move LEFT to (1, 4).**\n    *   This immediately eats Apple A6 (1, 4) this turn. Length increases to 8. Score increases to 7.\n    *   This path deviates from A5 (2, 2). After eating A6, the snake head will be at (1, 4). From (1, 4), the snake is 3 steps away from A5 (2, 2) via (1, 3) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2), or 2 steps via (2, 4) segment, but we cannot move onto our body. Wait, my body is (2, 5), so (2, 4) is currently safe space. From (1, 4), I can move to (2, 4) next turn. Then I would still be 2 steps from A5 (2, 2).\n    *   If I eat A6 (1, 4) now, I secure the apple and the lead, and I postpone eating A5 by about 1 turn compared to moving DOWN directly.\n\n*   **Option 3: Move RIGHT to (3, 4).**\n    *   Delays goal, less optimal.\n\n**Comparison of DOWN vs. LEFT:**\n*   **DOWN:** T26: (2, 3). T27: (2, 2) [Eat A5]. Score 7.\n*   **LEFT:** T26: (1, 4) [Eat A6]. Score 7. T27: (2, 4). T28: (2, 3). T29: (2, 2) [Eat A5]. This is slower for A5.\n\nHowever, if I move LEFT, I secure an apple immediately this turn, denying the opponent access to it, and gaining a lead. Since both snakes now have 6 apples, securing one immediately is hugely beneficial.\n\nLet's analyze Enemy 0's potential moves from (4, 3):\nEnemy 0 already ate A2 (4, 3) and is now at (4, 3). Its body is [(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8)]. Tail (3, 8) will be free.\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 4):** Into body. Suicide.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 2):** Safe. Path towards A3 (4, 1). (Most likely direction).\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 3):** Safe. Further from apples.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 3):** Safe. Further from apples.\n\nIf Enemy 0 moves DOWN to (4, 2):\n*   T27: Enemy 0 moves to (4, 1) [Eat A3]. Score 7.\n\nIf I choose DOWN (Target A5):\n*   T26: I move to (2, 3). Enemy 0 moves to (4, 2).\n*   T27: I move to (2, 2) [Eat A5]. Score 7. Enemy 0 moves to (4, 1) [Eat A3]. Score potentially 7. (Double consume, tied scores).\n*   A6 (1, 4) remains available.\n\nIf I choose LEFT (Target A6):\n*   T26: I move to (1, 4) [Eat A6]. Score 7. Enemy 0 moves to (4, 2).\n*   T27: I am at (1, 4) (Head). Enemy 0 is at (4, 2) (Head). We are free to move. I can move RIGHT to (2, 4) to pivot towards A5, or DOWN to (1, 3) to move toward A5/A3. Enemy 0 moves to (4, 1) [Eat A3]. Score 8 for me, 7 for Enemy 0.\n*   This is clearly better. I secure an apple and maintain a lead, while only slightly delaying the consumption of A5 compared to the rival's consumption of A3.\n\n**Safety Check for LEFT (1, 4):**\nNew Head: (1, 4).\nEnemy 0\u2019s likely new position (4, 2) or (3, 3). No collision risk.\n\nMoving LEFT to consume A6 (1, 4) is the most beneficial move as it guarantees a score increase this turn and pulls me into the left side of the board for potential cleaner access to A5 (2, 2) afterwards.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T27+):**\nT26: Move LEFT to eat A6 (1, 4).\nT27: Move RIGHT to (2, 4), setting up for A5 (2, 2).

The tail segment (3, 9) would disappear, but since I ate, it remains. My body is now [(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9)].

It might target A1 (7, 1) or A3 (8, 2).\n\nThe move DOWN to (1, 3) is safe, efficient, and ensures we maintain a path to A4 (2, 2) quickly, securing our 8th apple soon. This maintains tempo and keeps us ahead of the score unless Enemy 0 simultaneously finds a faster apple, which is unlikely given its current position and the location of the remaining apples A1, A3, A5.\n\nA5 is at (9, 9) and far away. A3 is at (8, 2) and A1 at (7, 1). Enemy 0 is closest to A1/A3. We are closest to A4.\n\nChoosing DOWN.\n\n---\n**Long-Term Plan (T28+):**\nT27: Move DOWN to (1, 3). (Sets up for A4 (2, 2)).

It also keeps a buffer from the bottom wall.\n\nCrucially, we must check for collisions with Enemy 0. Enemy 0 is at (4, 1) and will likely move to (5, 1).

Empty space.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN (eat apple), RIGHT.\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy 0's Movement (from (5, 1)):**\nEnemy 0 is at (5, 1). Nearest apples are (7, 1) [dist 2] and (8, 2) [dist 4].\nEnemy 0 will almost certainly move towards (7, 1).\nPossible Enemy 0 safe moves:\n*   RIGHT to (6, 1): Towards A1 (7, 1). Highly likely.\n*   UP to (5, 2): Safe, but slightly further from A1.\n*   DOWN to (5, 0): Safe, moving away from all apples.\n*   LEFT to (4, 1): Into body. Suicide.\n\nI predict Enemy 0 moves RIGHT to (6, 1). This move does not interfere with my current goal.\n\n**3. Evaluate My Strategic Moves (Target A3 (2, 2)):**\n\n*   **Option 1: Move DOWN to (2, 2).**\n    *   This eats the apple. Score 8. Length 9.\n    *   This is the optimal move.\n\n*   **Option 2: Move RIGHT to (3, 3).**\n    *   This avoids the apple, allowing Enemy 0 to potentially move towards it (though unlikely from (5, 1)).\n    *   It delays eating the apple for no good reason. Not optimal.\n\nThe choice is clear: move DOWN to eat the apple at (2, 2). No collision risk.\n\n**4. Long-Term Plan (T30+):**\nT29: Move DOWN to (2, 2) (Eat A3). Score 8. Enemy 0 likely moves RIGHT to (6, 1).\nT30: My head is at (2, 2). New nearest apples: A1(7, 1), A2(8, 2), A5(1, 9).\nEnemy 0 is moving towards A1(7, 1). I should target A2(8, 2) or perhaps pivot up towards A5(1, 9). A5 is closer (dist 7 vs dist 8 for A2).\n\nIf I target A5 (1, 9):\n(2, 2) -> UP (2, 3) -> UP (2, 4) [oops, body is at (2, 4)]\nWe need to maneuver around my existing tall wall of body segments (2, 4) through (2, 8).\n\nPath to A5 (1, 9):\n(2, 2) -> (2, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> ... (3 turns minimum to get past the base of my body).\nPath to A2 (8, 2):\n(2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (4, 2) [oops, Enemy 0 body at (4, 2)]\nThis path is blocked by Enemy 0's body.\n\nWe must check the board map to confirm spatial relationship after moves.\n\nIf I eat (2, 2), my body segments will be: (2, 2) (H), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8) (T).\n\nTargeting the northern apples (1, 9) and (9, 9) seems strategically important as Enemy 0 is moving East/South.\n\nLet's assume Enemy 0 reaches (7, 1) around T31/T32. Then they might go for (8, 2).\n\nIf I follow the wall from (2, 2):\nT30: UP to (2, 3) (Not safe, body at (2, 3) after move is completed.) Wait, the body shifts. After I move DOWN to (2,2), my old head (2, 3) becomes the new first body segment. Moving UP back to (2, 3) is moving backwards into myself.\n\nI must move away from (2, 3). Options from (2, 2):\n1. LEFT (1, 2)\n2. DOWN (2, 1)\n3. RIGHT (3, 2) (Blocked by body S0 at (4, 2) if I attempt to go right further)\n\nIf I go LEFT (1, 2). Then UP towards (1, 9).\n(1, 2) -> (1, 3) [blocked by body]\n\nIf I go DOWN (2, 1). Then LEFT or RIGHT.\n(2, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0) -> (0, 0)\n(2, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (3, 0)\n\nThis requires careful calculation for T30. For T29, the move is definitely **DOWN**.\n\nDOWN",

B3: 1, 3)\nT31: LEFT to (0, 2)\nT32: UP to (0, 3)\nT33: UP to (0, 4)\nT34: UP to (0, 5) (Eat Apple) -> 4 turns.\n\nThis is much faster than the DOWN route (4 turns vs 6 turns).\n\n**3. Head-on Collision Check:**\nT30: My Head (2, 2) -> (1, 2).\nEnemy Head (6, 1) -> (7, 1) (Assumed). No collision risk.\n\n**4. Alternative: Move RIGHT to (3, 2):**\nIf I move RIGHT (3, 2), I might be able to target A2 (8, 2).\nT30: RIGHT to (3, 2). H: (3, 2). Body includes (2, 2), (2, 3), etc.\nT31: From (3, 2), I am attempting to move to (4, 2). But Enemy 0's body remains at (4, 2) after their move.\nS0 will be (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5).\nIf I move to (4, 2) I hit their body and die. RIGHT is not immediately fatal but leads to a blocked path.\n\n**Conclusion for T30:**\nMoving LEFT to (1, 2) sets me up for a very quick 4-turn path to Apple A5 (0, 5). This avoids the cluster of enemy body segments and my own long vertical wall of segments.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T31+):**\nT31: Move LEFT (0, 2).\nT32: Move UP (0, 3).\nT33: Move UP (0, 4).\nT34: Move UP (0, 5) (Eat A5).\n\nThis seems optimal for capturing the next apple while Enemy 0 eats A1 (7, 1). If Enemy 0 is aggressive after eating A1, they might move toward A2 (8, 2) or A3 (9, 9). I will be well positioned in the NW corner.\n\nMy next planned move is LEFT.\n\n**My rationale for next turn (T31):**\nT30 move was LEFT to (1, 2). Head is now (1, 2). Body segments start with (2, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)...\nEnemy 0 likely moved RIGHT to (7, 1) and ate A1. Score tied at 8, lengths tied at 9.\nApple A5 (0, 5) is 3 moves away UP, 1 move LEFT towards it.\nNext move should be LEFT to (0, 2) to continue sequence towards (0, 5).\n\nLEFT",

(4 turns total from (2, 2))\n\nIf I execute **LEFT to (0, 2)**:\nNew Head: (0, 2). I am one step closer to (0, 5).\nThis move is safe and directly follows the established shortest path to the currently closest apple (distance 3 remaining).\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (1, 1)**:\nNew Head: (1, 1). This delays reaching (0, 5).\nD((1, 1), (0, 5)) = |1-0| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5. (Compare to D((0, 2), (0, 5)) = 3).\nThis move is pointless unless the LEFT route was somehow blocked, which it is not.\n\n**3. Enemy 0 Prediction:**\nEnemy 0 Head is at (7, 1). They just ate an apple and are now length 9.\nNext closest apples for S0:\n1. (8, 2): D = |7-8| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2. (RIGHT, UP)\n2. (9, 0): D = |7-9| + |1-0| = 2 + 1 = 3. (RIGHT, DOWN)\n3. (9, 9): D = |7-9| + |1-9| = 2 + 8 = 10.\n\nIt is highly likely Enemy 0 will move towards (8, 2).\nFrom (7, 1), safe moves for S0:\n*   UP (7, 2): Safe.\n*   DOWN (7, 0): Safe.\n*   LEFT (6, 1): UNSAFE (Body B1).\n*   RIGHT (8, 1): Safe.\n\nIf S0 aims for (8, 2):\nOption 1: RIGHT to (8, 1). T32: UP to (8, 2). (2 turns)\nOption 2: UP to (7, 2). T32: RIGHT to (8, 2). (2 turns)\n\nEither path takes S0 2 turns to eat the apple at (8, 2).\n\nSince A1 is 3 moves away for me, I should get my apple first, 4 turns total starting from T30.\nT31: LEFT to (0, 2) (Distance 3 remaining).\nT32: UP to (0, 3) (Distance 2 remaining).\nT33: UP to (0, 4) (Distance 1 remaining).\nT34: UP to (0, 5) (Eat).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving LEFT to (0, 2) is the optimal move to secure the next apple. There are no collision conflicts with the enemy snake, as they are far away and moving east/south east.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T32+):**\nT32: UP to (0, 3).\nT33: UP to (0, 4).\nT34: UP to (0, 5) (Eat A5).\n\nLEFT",

They will reach the apple in 1 turn (T32).\n\nMy snake needs 3 turns (T32, T33, T34) to reach (0, 5).\nSince S0 will secure their target apple first, I must ensure I stick to my plan to secure mine quickly when the path is clear.\n\nThe planned move UP to (0, 3) is safe and optimal for reaching (0, 5). There is no risk of collision or trapping.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMove UP to continue the approach to the apple at (0, 5).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T33+):**\nT33: UP to (0, 4).\nT34: UP to (0, 5) (Eat A5).\nAfter eating, the next apples are (1, 9), (9, 9), (9, 0).\nIf S0 eats (8, 2), A (1, 9) is the closest remaining apple for me (D=8). A (9, 9) is D=13. A (9, 0) is D=14.\nIf I turn RIGHT after eating (0, 5), I can start heading up the left wall towards (1, 9).\nT35: RIGHT to (1, 5).\nT36: UP to (1, 6).\n...\n\nUP",

Possible moves for S0:\n*   UP to (8, 2): UNSAFE (Body B1).\n*   DOWN to (8, 0): Safe, leads towards A (9, 0) or A (0, 0).\n*   LEFT to (7, 1): UNSAFE (Body B3).\n*   RIGHT to (9, 1): Safe, leads towards A (9, 0) or A (9, 9).\n\nS0 likely chooses RIGHT to (9, 1) to position for (9, 0) or (9, 9), or DOWN to (8, 0) if prioritizing (9, 0).

(9, 9): D = 13 (RIGHT 9, UP 4).\n\nTargeting (0, 0) requires 5 DOWN moves along the left wall. This is a very safe route and helps preserve space.\nTargeting (1, 9) requires moving RIGHT to (1, 5) and then UP. This seems equally efficient distance-wise (5 steps).\n\nSince I am already at the top left corner (Y=5) and have significant length, moving down to (0, 0) keeps me contained on the left side and utilizes the safe left wall path.\n\nPlan: Move UP to eat (0, 5).

New Head: (0, 5). Next, the closest apples are (0, 0) and (1, 9), both 5 steps away.

Determine Immediate Safety from (0, 5):**\nMy Head (0, 5).\n\nImmediate moves:\n*   **UP to (0, 6):** SAFE. Empty space.\n*   **DOWN to (0, 4):** UNSAFE. Segment (0, 4) is my body (B1). Moving directly backwards.\n*   **LEFT to (-1, 5):** UNSAFE. Out of bounds.\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 5):** SAFE. Empty space.\n\nSafe moves: UP (0, 6) and RIGHT (1, 5).\n\n**2. Evaluate Apple Targets:**\nClosest apples to (0, 5):\n1. (0, 0): D = 5 (Straight DOWN).\n2. (1, 9): D = 5 (RIGHT 1, UP 4).\n3. (8, 7): D = 8 (RIGHT 8, UP 2).\n4. (9, 0): D = 14 (RIGHT 9, DOWN 5).\n5. (9, 9): D = 13 (RIGHT 9, UP 4).\n\nThe apples (0, 0) and (1, 9) are equally distant.\n\n**Option A: Targeting (0, 0) (Move UP then prepare for DOWN):**\nIf I move UP to (0, 6), I continue along the left wall. To reach (0, 0), I have to move DOWN later. My body segments along X=0 are (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2). Moving down from (0, 6) seems like setting up a difficult return path, possibly trapping my head above my body chain if the tail doesn't clear the path quickly enough.\n\n*Correction on Path to (0, 0):*\nTo go to (0, 0), I need to go: (0, 5) -> (0, 4) (BODY B1, unsafe) -> ...\nThe move DOWN to (0, 4) is *not* safe this turn because it is my current body segment B1.\n\nSince (0, 4) is B1, I *cannot* move directly DOWN towards (0, 0) right now until my tail (2, 4) moves and B1 becomes a safe cell.\n\n**Option B: Targeting (1, 9) (Move RIGHT):**\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 5), I start moving towards (1, 9).\nPath: (0, 5) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 6) -> (1, 7) -> (1, 8) -> (1, 9). This is 5 steps. This path uses clear space.\n\n**3. Enemy 0 Projection:**\nS0 Head: (8, 0).\nS0 Body: (8, 1), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3).\nApples nearby for S0: (9, 0), (8, 7).\n\nSafe moves for S0 from (8, 0):\n*   UP to (8, 1): UNSAFE (Body B1).\n*   DOWN to (8, -1): UNSAFE (Out of bounds).\n*   LEFT to (7, 0): SAFE.\n*   RIGHT to (9, 0): SAFE, A. Eating!\n\nGiven S0 is one step from the apple (9, 0), S0 will almost certainly move RIGHT to (9, 0) and eat the apple, increasing their score to 10 and length to 11.\n\nS0's predicted new head: (9, 0).\n\n**4. Strategic Decision (Prioritizing (1, 9)):**\nSince (0, 0) is currently blocked/difficult due to my B1 being at (0, 4), the safer and more direct path is towards (1, 9). Both safe moves (UP to 0, 6) and (RIGHT to 1, 5) facilitate reaching (1, 9).\n\n*If I move UP to (0, 6):* Next move options from (0, 6): DOWN (safe, B2 moves), LEFT (OOB), RIGHT (1, 6, safe), UP (0, 7, safe). To reach (1, 9), I would eventually need to move right.\nPath: (0, 5) -> UP (0, 6) -> RIGHT (1, 6) -> UP -> UP -> UP (1, 9). Total 5 moves.\n\n*If I move RIGHT to (1, 5):* Next move options from (1, 5): DOWN (1, 4, safe, B8 moves), LEFT (0, 5, safe, T), RIGHT (2, 5, safe), UP (1, 6, safe). To reach (1, 9), I would move straight UP.\nPath: (0, 5) -> RIGHT (1, 5) -> UP (1, 6) -> UP (1, 7) -> UP (1, 8) -> UP (1, 9). Total 5 moves.\n\nMoving RIGHT (1, 5) sets me up perfectly for the straight UP ascent towards (1, 9) along the X=1 column, which is mostly free space. This is the simplest and safest path to the nearest apple.\n\n**5. Collision Check:**\nMy move RIGHT to (1, 5) is far from S0's predicted move RIGHT to (9, 0). No collision risk.\n\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (1, 5) is the optimal choice.\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nT35: RIGHT to (1, 5), targeting Apple (1, 9).\nT36: UP to (1, 6).\nT37: UP to (1, 7).\nT38: UP to (1, 8).\nT39: UP to (1, 9) (Eat!).\nAfter eating (1, 9), the next closest apple is (8, 7). Since I will be at (1, 9), I will be positioned to either move towards (8, 7) or, if S0 moved away from it, (9, 9).\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

Moving into tail is only safe if the tail moves *out* of that cell, which it will if I don't eat an apple. However, since the tail is the last segment, it is technically safe *if* I don't eat an apple, but generally discouraged unless necessary. Let's check the body list: (1, 4) is the last segment B10. (1, 5) -> (1, 4) is moving onto the current tail cell, which will be empty after the snake moves without eating. Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (0, 5):** UNSAFE. Segment (0, 5) is my body (B1). Moving directly backwards into B1.\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 5):** SAFE. Empty space.\n\nSafe moves: UP (1, 6), DOWN (1, 4), RIGHT (2, 5).\n\n**2.

Next steps: (1, 7), (1, 8), (1, 9). 4 moves total to eat. Excellent.\n*   **DOWN to (1, 4):** Moves away from (1, 9) and towards a crowded area/wall. Bad.\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 5):** Moves away from (1, 9). (2, 5) is somewhat open, but this increases the path length to (1, 9) to D=5 ((2, 5) -> (1, 5) -> (1, 6) -> ...), or D=6 ((2, 5) -> (2, 6) -> (1, 6) -> ...). Less efficient than UP.\n\n**4.

OOB.\n*   LEFT to (8, 0): UNSAFE. Body B1.\n*   RIGHT to (10, 0): UNSAFE. OOB.\n\nS0 is trapped along the right wall! S0 must move UP to (9, 1). This is a very predictable move.\n\n**5. Collision Check and Strategy Confirmation:**\nI am moving UP to (1, 6). S0 is moving UP to (9, 1). No collision risk.\n\nMoving UP keeps me on the direct, clear path to the closest apple (1, 9).\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nT36: UP to (1, 6), targeting Apple (1, 9).\nT37: UP to (1, 7).\nT38: UP to (1, 8).\nT39: UP to (1, 9) (Eat!).\nAfter T39, I will be at (1, 9).

Eating opportunity.\n*   **DOWN to (1, 7):** UNSAFE. My body segment.\n*   **LEFT to (0, 8):** SAFE. Empty space.\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 8):** SAFE.

This is the optimal move.\n\n**3. Analyze UP move to (1, 9):**\n*   This move guarantees an apple, increasing my score to 10 and my length to 11.\n*   It places me in coordinate (1, 9).\n\n**4.

Body.\n*   LEFT to (8, 3): SAFE.\n*   RIGHT: OOB.\n\nS0 is currently positioned to potentially sweep up apples (8, 7) and (9, 9).\nIf S0 moves UP to (9, 4): It targets (9, 9) (D=5) or maybe (8, 7) (D=5).\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (8, 3): It targets (8, 7) (D=4) or (6, 7) (D=6).\n\nSince I am securing (1, 9), I need to plan for the remaining apples.\n\n**5. Collision Check:**\nI move to (1, 9). S0 is moving far right/center. No risk of collision this turn.\n\n**6. Long-Term Strategy after eating (1, 9):**\nMy new head position is (1, 9). Length 11.\nRemaining apples: (9, 9), (0, 0), (8, 7), (6, 7).\n\n*   S0 is likely headed towards the upper right quadrant (9, 9) or the center-right (8, 7)/(6, 7).\n*   From (1, 9), I am close to (0, 0) (D=9) but far from (8, 7) (D=8) and (6, 7) (D=6).\n*   Since S0 is leading in score (10 vs my 9, soon to be 10 vs 10), I must contest the closer/more defensible apples.\n\nIf I move UP: EAT (1, 9).\nNext turn (T40) from (1, 9):\n1. Move RIGHT to (2, 9). Gets me started East.\n2. Move DOWN to (1, 8). Backtracking temporarily.\n3. Move LEFT to (0, 9). Closer to (0, 0).\n\nOption A: Go for (6, 7) or (8, 7) to contest S0.\nStart East: (2, 9) -> (3, 9) -> (3, 8) -> (4, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (6, 7) (Eat). ~7 moves if direct.\n\nOption B: Go for (0, 0).\nStart South/Left: (0, 9) -> (0, 8) -> ... -> (0, 0) (Eat). ~9 moves if direct.\n\nSince S0 is quite far away from the left side, (0, 0) is a safe, uncontested apple, but it is far away and takes up many moves that could be used to contest the center. Given the proximity of S0 to (8, 7) and (9, 9), I should prioritize moving into the central battleground. Getting (6, 7) first seems reasonable as it is the closest contested apple.\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nT39: UP to (1, 9) (Eat Apple). Score 10, Length 11.\nT40: Move RIGHT to (2, 9). Start mobilization towards the center-right apples (6, 7) and (8, 7).\nT41: Move RIGHT to (3, 9) or DOWN to (2, 8). Prefer moving East into the open board space.

Targets (9, 9) (D=4) or (8, 7) (D=4).\n*   DOWN to (9, 3): UNSAFE. Body segment.\n*   LEFT to (8, 4): SAFE. Targets (8, 7) (D=3) or (6, 7) (D=5).\n*   RIGHT to (10, 4): UNSAFE. OOB.\n\nS0 is clearly targeting the upper right quadrant, specifically (9, 9) or (8, 7). (8, 4) targets (8, 7) most directly. (9, 5) targets (9, 9) and (8, 7) equally.\n\nThere is zero immediate collision risk with S0, as we are on opposite sides of the map.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves and Strategy:**\nMy long-term plan was to mobilize towards the contested center/right apples (6, 7), (8, 7).\n\n*   **Option A: Move RIGHT to (2, 9).**\n    This move continues my mobilization eastward, setting up a path across the top of the board to (8, 7) or down towards (6, 7).\n    Distance to (8, 7): Manhattan distance (8-2) + (9-7) = 6 + 2 = 8 moves.\n    Distance to (6, 7): Manhattan distance (6-2) + (9-7) = 4 + 2 = 6 moves.\n    Distance to (9, 9): Manhattan distance (9-2) + (9-9) = 7 moves.\n\n*   **Option B: Move LEFT to (0, 9).**\n    This move positions me for the uncontested apple at (0, 0).\n    Distance to (0, 0): Manhattan distance (0-0) + (9-0) = 9 moves.\n    If I go for (0, 0), I cede the center/right competition, likely allowing S0 to pull ahead in score and obtain better board control.\n\nGiven the tied score, I cannot afford to ignore the contested apples. S0 is highly likely to grab (9, 9) or (8, 7) soon. If S0 moves to (8, 4) it is 3 moves from (8, 7). If I move right, (6, 7) is 6 moves away.\n\nI should prioritize catching (6, 7) since it appears slightly closer and less contested than (8, 7) is now. Moving RIGHT to (2, 9) is the first step in this maneuver.\n\n**4. Check for Future Traps:**\nMoving right keeps me in the open upper half of the board, maximizing future options.\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nT40: Move RIGHT to (2, 9). Initiate movement toward center-right apples (6, 7) and (8, 7).\nT41: Move RIGHT to (3, 9). Continue East.\nT42: Move RIGHT to (4, 9). Consider moving down toward (6, 7).\nT43: Move DOWN to (4, 8) or RIGHT to (5, 9). Maintain pressure on the center. If S0 secures the high northern apple (9, 9), then (6, 7) is a crucial follow-up target.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

Moving DOWN (2, 8) is a good choice too, but perhaps makes commitment slightly earlier.\n\nSince I am trying to contest the area, keeping high seems generally safer and allows faster reaction to S0's moves if they head south toward the center line (like (5, 4) or (6, 7)).\n\nI will continue the high eastern movement. If S0 goes to (9, 6) I can pivot to (6, 7) confidently. If S0 goes to (8, 5) I might try to beat them to (8, 7) if the path remains clear, but (6, 7) remains the primary target.\n\n**4. Long-Term Plan Update:**\nT41: Move RIGHT to (3, 9). Continue East towards (6, 7).\nT42: Move RIGHT to (4, 9).\nT43: Move RIGHT to (5, 9) or DOWN to (4, 8) depending on S0's confirmed position and surrounding body movement. Target is (6, 7).\n\nRIGHT",

UP is simply the more direct route to the nearest apple and maintains simpler, safer geometry.\n\nShort long-term plan:\n- Continue UP toward (9,9) and take that apple.

(4, 9) is safer.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (3, 8):\nNext move: RIGHT to (4, 8) (D=3 to (6, 7)) or DOWN to (3, 7) (D=4 to (6, 7)).

Let's consider the board topology and S0 positioning.\n\nS0 is either heading (9, 7) (toward 9, 9) or (8, 6) (toward 8, 7 and 6, 7). If S0 goes to (8, 6), S1 moving DOWN to (3, 8) seems slightly better positioned to cut across the board or react to S0 entering the middle lane (8, 7) or blocking (6, 7).\n\nIf S0 goes to (8, 6):\nS1 (3, 8) -> (4, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (6, 7) (Target in 4 turns). This path is relatively safe.\nS1 (4, 9) -> (4, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (6, 7) (Target in 4 turns). This path requires a sharp turn right at the start.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 9), I keep my options open for potentially grabbing (9, 9) if S0 pivots away, or continuing to press toward (6, 7). The high position (Y=9) maximizes defensive options along the top edge.\n\nGiven S0's proximity to (9, 9) and (8, 7), it is likely S0 will grab one of those soon.\nIf S0 goes UP to (9, 7), S0 is now 2 steps from (9, 9) and 4 steps from (8, 7).\nIf S0 goes LEFT to (8, 6), S0 is now 1 step from (8, 7) and 3 steps from (6, 7).\n\nIf S0 goes (8, 6) (most critical threat):\nIt will take (8, 7) next turn (T43). S1 should ignore (8, 7) and focus on (6, 7).\nS1 needs to reach (6, 7) by T46.\n\nScenario: S0 to (8, 6) (T42). S0 takes (8, 7) (T43).\nS1 moves RIGHT to (4, 9) (T42).\nT43: S1 moves DOWN to (4, 8). D to (6, 7) is 3. S0 is now at (8, 7).\nT44: S1 moves RIGHT to (5, 8). D to (6, 7) is 2.\nT45: S1 moves RIGHT to (6, 8). D to (6, 7) is 1.\nT46: S1 moves DOWN to (6, 7). Apple collected.\n\nScenario: S0 to (8, 6) (T42). S0 takes (8, 7) (T43).\nS1 moves DOWN to (3, 8) (T42).\nT43: S1 moves RIGHT to (4, 8). D to (6, 7) is 3. S0 is now at (8, 7).\nT44: S1 moves RIGHT to (5, 8). D to (6, 7) is 2.\nT45: S1 moves RIGHT to (6, 8). D to (6, 7) is 1.\nT46: S1 moves DOWN to (6, 7). Apple collected.\n\nBoth options lead to (6, 7) capture by T46, assuming safe path. Moving RIGHT to (4, 9) maintains a high position, which is often strategically advantageous for keeping movement options open along the top border. I will stick with the eastward movement plan.\n\n**4.

The previous tail (0, 2) has potentially been vacated, but since length is 12, the new body includes (0, 3) and the old tail (0, 3) moved to where (0, 2) was, but coordinates provided show (0, 3) is the last segment *before* the head/body listing ends. Let's rely on the coordinate list: Body ends at (0, 3). Since I didn't eat an apple, the tail (0, 3) will vacate to (0, 4) on T43. Wait, the provided state list for ID 1 has 11 body segments plus the head, totaling 12 length.\n    *   Head: (4, 9)\n    *   Body: [(3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3)] (Length 11 + 1 Head = 12).\n    *   Tail (segment that moves): (0, 3). If I don't eat, (0, 3) moves to (0, 4), (0, 4) moves to (0, 5), etc. Wait, the list is head-to-tail. (0, 3) is the current TAIL. The cell (0, 3) will vacate.\n\nEnemy Snake (ID 0):\n*   Head: (9, 7). Length: 12 (Apples: 10).\n*   Body: [(9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2) (7, 2 will vacate)].\n*   Tail is at (8, 2). The segment (8, 2) should move. Wait, the provided body list for S0 is 10 segments long.\n    *   Head: (9, 7)\n    *   Body: [(9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2)] (Length 11).\n    *   Previous turn S0 length was 11. It must have eaten an apple on T42 to reach length 12 at (9, 7). Let's assume S0 has length 12, meaning the list *here* is correct: Head+10 body segments = 11. If S0 was length 11 and moved to (9, 7), it did not grow. The length is 11, and the tail (8, 2) will vacate.\n\n*Self-Correction on Length:* The previous turn S1 was length 11 (Head + 10 body segments). Since S1 moved to (4, 9) and did not hit an apple, S1 is still length 11. The provided body list has 10 segments. 10 + 1 head = 11. The tail (0, 3) will vacate.\n\nApples Remaining: (9, 9), (0, 0), (8, 7), (6, 7), (5, 4). (5 apples total).\nScores are tied 10-10.\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safety for Snake 1 (Head at 4, 9):**\nMy occupied segments (excluding the head (4, 9) and the tail (0, 3) which will vacate): (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 4).\nEnemy occupied segments: All S0 body segments, listed above, plus S0 head (9, 7).\n\nImmediate moves from (4, 9):\n*   **UP to (4, 10):** UNSAFE. Out of Bounds (Y=10).\n*   **DOWN to (4, 8):** SAFE. Empty space.\n*   **LEFT to (3, 9):** UNSAFE. My body segment (directly behind the head).\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 9):** SAFE. Empty space.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN (4, 8), RIGHT (5, 9).\n\n**2. Analyze Strategy (Targeting (6, 7) or (5, 4)):**\nMy plan from the previous turn was to target (6, 7).\n\n*   **Apple Distances from (4, 9):**\n    *   (6, 7): (6-4) + (9-7) = 2 + 2 = 4. (Target)\n    *   (9, 9): (9-4) + 0 = 5.\n    *   (5, 4): (5-4) + (9-4) = 1 + 5 = 6.\n    *   (8, 7): (8-4) + (9-7) = 4 + 2 = 6.\n    *   (0, 0): (4-0) + (9-0) = 13.\n\n(6, 7) is the closest apple.\n\n*   **Enemy Snake 0 position:** Head at (9, 7). Closest apples for S0:\n    *   (9, 9): D=2 (UP, UP)\n    *   (8, 7): D=1 (LEFT)\n\nS0 has a choice between (9, 9) or (8, 7). Both are excellent options. Given the proximity, S0 will likely move LEFT to (8, 7) to collect the apple or UP to (9, 8) toward (9, 9).\n\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (8, 7), it will collect an apple.\nIf S0 moves UP to (9, 8), it targets (9, 9).\n\nIf S0 takes (8, 7) (T43), this apple is gone. My previous calculation suggested S0 might take (8, 7) on T43. This means I must focus entirely on (6, 7).\n\n*   **Evaluating Safe Moves for S1 (Head 4, 9) toward (6, 7):**\n\n    *   **Option A: Move DOWN to (4, 8).**\n        New distance to (6, 7): (6-4) + (8-7) = 2 + 1 = 3 moves.\n        Path: (4, 8) -> (5, 8) [R] -> (6, 8) [R] -> (6, 7) [D]. (4 moves including current T43).\n\n    *   **Option B: Move RIGHT to (5, 9).**\n        New distance to (6, 7): (6-5) + (9-7) = 1 + 2 = 3 moves.\n        Path: (5, 9) -> (6, 9) [R] -> (6, 8) [D] -> (6, 7) [D]. (4 moves including current T43).\n\nBoth options require 3 more steps from the next position, meaning 4 total turns (T43, T44, T45, T46) to reach the apple (6, 7).\n\n**Comparing DOWN vs RIGHT:**\n\nMoving DOWN (4, 8): Gets me off the boundary immediately and into the middle of the playing field, setting up a straight shot (R, R, D) to (6, 7). This path also avoids conflict with the top boundary, which is usually preferable.\n\nMoving RIGHT (5, 9): Keeps me on the boundary, requiring me to move fully right before dropping down (R, D, D). This works, but (4, 8) offers slightly more central positioning for reactive moves if needed.\n\nLet's check for proximity to S0. S0 is operating entirely on the right side (X=8/9). My snake is heading right/south. By moving DOWN to (4, 8), I maintain maximum distance from S0's expected movement area (8, 7) and (9, 9).\n\nIf I choose DOWN to (4, 8):\nT44: Move RIGHT to (5, 8). (Safe: (5, 8) is empty).\nT45: Move RIGHT to (6, 8). (Safe: (6, 8) is empty).\nT46: Move DOWN to (6, 7). Apple captured.\n\nThis seems like the safest and most direct optimal path to (6, 7).\n\n**3. Check Collision Risk and Enemy Movement Prediction:**\nS0 Head is at (9, 7).\nPossible S0 moves: UP (9, 8), DOWN (9, 6 - body), LEFT (8, 7 - Apple), RIGHT (OOB).\nS0 is highly likely to move LEFT to (8, 7) and eat the apple, or UP to (9, 8) toward (9, 9).\n\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (8, 7): S0 eats (8, 7). My move DOWN to (4, 8) is safe.\nIf S0 moves UP to (9, 8): My move DOWN to (4, 8) is safe.\n\nNo immediate collision risk. Moving DOWN is optimal for reaching (6, 7).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (for next few turns):**\nT43: Move DOWN to (4, 8). Target (6, 7).\nT44: Move RIGHT to (5, 8).\nT45: Move RIGHT to (6, 8).\nT46: Move DOWN to (6, 7) (Capture). Then evaluate remaining apples (9, 9), (0, 0), (5, 4). (5, 4) or (9, 9) will be the next target based on S0 position.\n\nDOWN",

Since I did not eat an apple last turn (4, 9) -> (4, 8), the segment (0, 4) will vacate.\n\nEnemy Snake (ID 0):\n*   Head: (8, 7). Length: 12 (Apples: 11).\n*   Body: [(9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2)].\n*   S0 grew last turn, meaning S0 moved to an apple. The apple listing from T43 suggests (8, 7) was an apple. S0 must have moved L to (8, 7) and grown. Let's verify the current provided state: S0 Head is (8, 7). S0 score is 11. The previous turn S0 score was 11, but the head was at (9, 7). The apples listed for T44 *do not* include (8, 7), but the apple listing for T43 *did* include (8, 7). This confirms S0 must have eaten (8, 7) on T43, bringing its total to 11 apples. The length of S0 is 12 (Head + 11 body segments). Ah, wait. The provided S0 body is 11 segments long: 11 + 1 Head = 12 total length. This matches the movement/score confirmation.\n*   S0 Tail is at (8, 2) and will *not* vacate this turn because S0 grew. The new tail will be (8, 2). All S0 body segments remain occupied.\n\nApples Remaining: (9, 9), (0, 0), (6, 7), (5, 4), (3, 7). (5 apples total).\nScores: ID 1: 10, ID 0: 11. I am behind by 1 apple.\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safety for Snake 1 (Head at 4, 8):**\nMy occupied segments (excluding the head (4, 8) and the tail (0, 4) which will vacate): (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (0, 5).\nEnemy (S0) occupied segments: (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2).\n\nImmediate moves from (4, 8):\n*   **UP to (4, 9):** UNSAFE. My body segment (directly behind the head).\n*   **DOWN to (4, 7):** SAFE. Empty space.\n*   **LEFT to (3, 8):** SAFE. Empty space.\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 8):** SAFE. Empty space.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN (4, 7), LEFT (3, 8), RIGHT (5, 8).\n\n**2. Analyze Strategy (Targeting (6, 7)):**\nMy plan was to move (4, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (6, 7) (Capture).\n\n*   **Apple Distance to (6, 7) from (4, 8):** 3 moves (2 right, 1 down).\n\n*   **Option A: Move RIGHT to (5, 8).** (Planned move)\n    Distance to (6, 7) from (5, 8): (6-5) + (8-7) = 1 + 1 = 2 moves.\n    Path: (5, 8) -> (6, 8) [R] -> (6, 7) [D].\n    This puts me on track for a quick capture.\n\n*   **Option B: Move DOWN to (4, 7).**\n    Distance to (6, 7) from (4, 7): (6-4) + 0 = 2 moves.\n    Path: (4, 7) -> (5, 7) [R] -> (6, 7) [R].\n    This is also effective (2 moves).\n\n*   **Option C: Move LEFT to (3, 8).**\n    Distance to (6, 7) from (3, 8): (6-3) + (8-7) = 3 + 1 = 4 moves. Slower.\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN are viable 2-move options to reach (6, 7). Let's evaluate risks/benefits.\n\n**Comparing RIGHT (5, 8) vs DOWN (4, 7):**\n\n1.  **Safety from S0:** S0 Head is at (8, 7).\n    S0 must have moved L to get to (8, 7).\n    Possible S0 moves from (8, 7):\n    *   UP to (8, 8): Safe.\n    *   DOWN to (8, 6): Safe.\n    *   LEFT to (7, 7): Safe.\n    *   RIGHT to (9, 7): Body segment. UNSAFE.\n\n    If I move RIGHT to (5, 8), I am 3 units away from S0's head. S0 is moving in the (8, X) or (7, X) range. We are safe from S0 regardless of R or D move.\n\n2.  **Obstacles/Future Headroom:**\n    *   If I pick RIGHT (5, 8): Next turn (T45) I move R to (6, 8). T46, I move D to (6, 7) & eat. This path is clean.\n    *   If I pick DOWN (4, 7): Next turn (T45) I move R to (5, 7). T46, I move R to (6, 7) & eat. This path is clean.\n\nThe apple (6, 7) is currently occupied by S1's path if I choose (4, 7).\nLooking at the board state:\n 7 . T . A . . A . 0 T\n(4, 7) is currently empty.\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 7), the path R->R is (5, 7) -> (6, 7).\nWait, (6, 7) is an apple. (4, 7) is empty. (5, 7) is empty. (6, 7) is apple.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 8), the path R->D is (6, 8) -> (6, 7).\n(5, 8) empty. (6, 8) empty. (6, 7) is apple.\n\nBoth paths take 2 turns to reach the apple (T45 arrival).\n\nHowever, note the presence of another apple at (3, 7).\nIf I choose DOWN (4, 7): I am adjacent to (3, 7). While (6, 7) is better, (3, 7) is also an option if S0 becomes aggressive towards (6, 7) (unlikely given S0's position).\nIf I choose RIGHT (5, 8): I am moving away from (3, 7).\n\nLet's maintain the planned path RIGHT (5, 8) as it leads directly to my primary target (6, 7) and keeps me a bit further North/East, which might be better for navigating around S0's expected movement toward (9, 9).\n\n**3. Check S0 Movement for T44:**\nS0 Head (8, 7). S0 needs (9, 9) or (5, 4) next. (9, 9) is distance 2 (U, R/U) and (5, 4) is distance 3+ (L, L, D, D). S0 will likely go for (9, 9).\n\nS0 paths to (9, 9):\n1. (8, 7) -> (8, 8) [U] -> (9, 8) [R]. Distance 2.\n2. (8, 7) -> (8, 8) [U] -> (8, 9) [U] -> (9, 9) [R]. Wait, S0 is length 12. Path 1 needs 2 moves.\n\nIf S0 moves UP to (8, 8): T45 S0 moves R to (9, 8) or U to (8, 9).\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (7, 7): T45 S0 moves U or L.\n\nIf S0 targets (9, 9), moving UP to (8, 8) seems the most logical start.\n\nMy move: RIGHT to (5, 8).\nS0 move prediction: UP to (8, 8).\nNeither move interferes with the other. My path to (6, 7) remains secure.\n\n**Conclusion:** Move RIGHT to (5, 8) to continue the clean approach to the apple at (6, 7), which I plan to capture in two turns (T46).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (for next few turns):**\nT44: Move RIGHT to (5, 8). Target (6, 7).\nT45: Move RIGHT to (6, 8).\nT46: Move DOWN to (6, 7) (Capture). Then, if S0 took (9, 9), target (5, 4). If not, potentially target (9, 9).\n\nRIGHT",

S0 needs to move to get to (6, 7) in 1 turn (or collide with me if I move RIGHT and S0 moves L to (6, 7), which is unlikely given S0 starting position).\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (5, 7):**\n    *   Distance to (6, 7): 1 move (RIGHT).\n    *   This is equally fast for capturing (6, 7).\n\n*   **Move UP to (5, 9):**\n    *   Moves away from (6, 7). Slower approach.\n\n**3. Check Collision Risk with S0 (Head at 7, 7):**\n\nS0 is extremely close to the apple (6, 7) and also close to (9, 9) and (3, 7). S0's length is 12, S0 is currently ahead.\n\nPossible S0 moves from (7, 7):\n*   U to (7, 8): Safe.\n*   D to (7, 6): Safe.\n*   L to (6, 7): **Apple (6, 7). S0 might take this.**\n*   R to (8, 7): S0 body. UNSAFE.\n\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (6, 7), S0 eats the apple. This would make S0 12 apples, and I would lose the target.\n\n**Scenario A: I move RIGHT to (6, 8).**\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (6, 7), S0 eats the apple. I move to (6, 8), positioned just above the apple spot. S0 is now at (6, 7). My next move (T46) would be DOWN to (6, 7) - a head-on collision, killing both of us, unless S0 moves away (e.g., L to (5, 7) or D to (6, 6)).\nIf S0 moves UP to (7, 8) or DOWN to (7, 6), I move to (6, 8). Apple is safe for T46 capture.\n\n**Scenario B: I move DOWN to (5, 7).**\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (6, 7), S0 eats the apple. I move to (5, 7). I am now adjacent to S0's head (6, 7). My next move (T46) would be RIGHT to (6, 7) - a head-on collision, killing both of us, unless S0 moves away.\n\nBoth RIGHT and DOWN allow S0 to claim the apple now. If S0 aims for (6, 7), I lose the apple and risk collision on the next turn if I foolishly try to move into the occupied square.\n\n**Re-evaluating Targets:**\nApple at (6, 7) is contested and risky.\nApple at (3, 7) is 3 moves away if I go RIGHT (5, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (7, 7). No, that's difficult.\nFrom (5, 8):\nTo (3, 7): (5, 8) -> (4, 8) [Body] -> (4, 7) [D] -> (3, 7) [L]. 2 moves minimum if (4, 8) wasn't body. Since (4, 8) is body, this path is impossible/fatal.\nPath to (3, 7): (5, 8) -> (5, 7) [D] -> (4, 7) [L] -> (3, 7) [L]. 3 moves.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 7), I am 2 moves from (3, 7).\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 8), I am 3 moves from (3, 7) via (6, 7) or (5, 7).\n\nLet's assume S0 targets (6, 7). I must abandon (6, 7) safety.\n\nIf S0 takes (6, 7), S0 is now (6, 7).\nMy goal shifts to:\n1. Apple (3, 7) (3 moves away via [D, L, L])\n2. Apple (5, 4) (4 moves away via [D, D, D, R/L])\n3. Apple (9, 9) (4 moves away via [R, R, U, U])\n4. Apple (0, 0) (8 moves away).\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (5, 7)**:\nT45: (5, 7).\nT46: (4, 7) or (6, 7) (if available).\nIf S0 goes to (6, 7), I move L to (4, 7). T47 I move L to (3, 7) and eat. (3 moves total to (3, 7)).\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (6, 8)**:\nT45: (6, 8).\nThis is far from (3, 7) and keeps me near the dangerous S0 activity.\n\nIf I move **UP to (5, 9)**:\nT45: (5, 9).\nThis sets me up nicely for (9, 9) if S0 goes elsewhere, but moves me away from (3, 7) and (5, 4).\n\n**Strategic Decision:** Since I am behind by 1 apple, and S0 is adjacent to (6, 7), I must prioritize an apple that S0 is unlikely to take immediately, while still being reachable within 3 turns. (3, 7) is a good secondary target.\n\nMoving DOWN to (5, 7) positions me perfectly to pivot to (3, 7) if S0 claims (6, 7).\nT45: (5, 7) [DOWN]\nIf S0 takes (6, 7):\nT46: (4, 7) [LEFT] (Adjacent to my body segment (4, 8), safe).\nT47: (3, 7) [LEFT] (Eat!)\n\nIf S0 moves UP to (7, 8) or DOWN to (7, 6):\nT46: (6, 7) [RIGHT] (Eat!) (2 moves total).\n\nThis plan makes DOWN the superior move because it gives me the option of reaching (6, 7) in 2 turns IF S0 misses it, and guarantees a path to (3, 7) in 3 turns IF S0 takes (6, 7).\n\n**Collision Check for DOWN (5, 7):**\nMy move (5, 8) -> (5, 7).\nS0 head (7, 7).\nS0 cannot reach (5, 7) this turn. Absolutely safe from collision.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (for next few turns):**\nT45: Move DOWN to (5, 7). This prepares for a 2-turn capture of (6, 7) or a 3-turn path to (3, 7) (if S0 captures (6, 7)).\nIf S0 takes (6, 7) [S0 head at (6, 7)]:\nT46: Move LEFT to (4, 7).\nT47: Move LEFT to (3, 7) (Capture).\nIf S0 misses (6, 7):\nT46: Move RIGHT to (6, 7) (Capture).\n\nDOWN",

Length: 12 (Apples: 10).\n*   Body: [(5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5)].\n*   Tail is at (1, 5). The segment (1, 5) will vacate as no apple was eaten last turn.\n\nEnemy Snake (ID 0):\n*   Head: (6, 7). Length: 13 (Apples: 12).\n*   Body: [(7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0), (8, 0), (8, 1)].\n*   Tail is at (8, 1). Snake 0 just ate the apple at (6, 7) because its score increased from 11 to 12, and its head moved from (7, 7) to (6, 7). Therefore, S0's tail (8, 1) will *remain* this turn.\n\nApples Remaining: (9, 9), (0, 0), (5, 4), (3, 7), (8, 3). (5 apples total).\nScores: ID 1: 10, ID 0: 12. I am behind by 2 apples.\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safety for Snake 1 (Head at 5, 7):**\nMy previous move was DOWN from (5, 8) to (5, 7). My current body segments are: (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5 - tail slot, will vacate).\nS0 head is now at (6, 7). S0 body is [(7, 7), (8, 7)...].\n\nImmediate moves from (5, 7):\n*   **UP to (5, 8):** UNSAFE. My body segment (directly behind the head).\n*   **DOWN to (5, 6):** SAFE. Empty space.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 7):** SAFE. Empty space. (This is a clear path toward the (3, 7) apple).\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 7):** UNSAFE. S0's head is currently at (6, 7). Collision, if S0 stands still, or head-on collision if S0 moves toward me.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN (5, 6), LEFT (4, 7).\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves based on Apple Targets:**\n\nS0 took the contested apple. I must pivot. My closest remaining apple is (3, 7).\n\n*   **Target (3, 7):** 2 moves away via LEFT (4, 7) then LEFT (3, 7).\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (4, 7):**\n    *   T46: (4, 7). This positions me 1 move away from the apple (3, 7).\n    *   S0 is at (6, 7). S0 needs at least 3 moves to reach (3, 7) if it goes via (5, 7), (4, 7) (which overlaps my path).\n    *   If S0 tries to block, S0 would have to move: (6, 7) -> (5, 7) [T46] -> (4, 7) [T47].\n    *   If I move LEFT to (4, 7) at T46, I can claim (3, 7) at T47. S0 cannot beat me to (3, 7).\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (5, 6):**\n    *   T46: (5, 6).\n    *   Distance to (3, 7): (5, 6) -> (5, 7) [U, if available/safe] -> (4, 7) [L] -> (3, 7) [L]. 3+ moves.\n    *   Distance to (5, 4): (5, 6) -> (5, 5) [D] -> (5, 4) [D] (Eat). 2 moves.\n\n**3. Decision between (3, 7) and (5, 4):**\n\n*   **Apple (3, 7):** Reachable in 2 moves (LEFT, LEFT). This is the fastest capture.\n*   **Apple (5, 4):** Reachable in 2 moves (DOWN, DOWN).\n\nLet's check S0's potential moves from (6, 7) and their impact on these two targets.\n\nS0's possible moves from (6, 7):\n*   Targeting (3, 7): (6, 7) -> (5, 7) [L] -> (4, 7) [L] -> (3, 7) [L]. 3 moves.\n*   Targeting (5, 4): (6, 7) -> (5, 7) [L] -> (5, 6) [D] -> (5, 5) [D] -> (5, 4) [D]. 4 moves.\n*   Targeting (8, 3): (6, 7) -> (7, 7) [R, body!] -> (7, 6) [D]. S0 cannot move RIGHT. The path for S0 is primarily DOWN or LEFT.\n\nS0 is currently near the center-right. It is more likely S0 will target (8, 3) (3 moves: D, D, R) or perhaps (9, 9) (4 moves: U, U, R, R).\n\nIf I move **LEFT to (4, 7)**:\nI secure (3, 7) in 2 turns while S0 is likely moving away or focusing on other centrally located apples like (5, 4).\nS0 cannot reach (3, 7) in 2 turns.\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (5, 6)**:\nI secure (5, 4) in 2 turns.\nS0 could try to contest this. If S0 moves L to (5, 7) at T46, and I move D to (5, 6), S0 is now positioned right behind me. At T47, S0 could move D to (5, 6) (my old spot) or D to (5, 5). If S0 moves to (5, 5) at T47, and I move D to (5, 4) (eating), S0 is right next to the apple spot. If I move to (5, 6), S0 is likely to continue moving down or left.\n\nSince both apples are 2 moves away and appear uncontested *this turn*, I should pick the path that is safer and maintains better movement options.\n\n**Safety Check (Proximity to S0):**\n*   Moving LEFT to (4, 7): S0 is at (6, 7). If S0 moves L to (5, 7), we are separated.\n*   Moving DOWN to (5, 6): S0 is at (6, 7). If S0 moves L to (5, 7), S0 is adjacent to me (4, 7) at T46.\n\n(4, 7) is a safer area, closer to my long body path, but (5, 6) leads directly into a clear area of the board.\n\nLet's look at the body arrangement. My body is covering coordinates (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5).\n\nPath LEFT to (4, 7):\nT46: (4, 7). Adjacent to (4, 8) (my body). Safe.\nT47: (3, 7) (Eat). Safe.\n\nPath DOWN to (5, 6):\nT46: (5, 6). Safe.\nT47: (5, 5) or (5, 4).\nIf (5, 5) (Free move): T48: (5, 4) (Eat). 3 moves total.\nIf (5, 4) (Eat): 2 moves total (D, D). Safe.\n\nBoth are 2-turn captures. (3, 7) requires moving along the edge of the large body segment leading up into the top-left area. (5, 4) takes me directly down the middle.\n\nI lean towards LEFT to target (3, 7). It leads slightly away from S0 and pushes S0 to commit to a direction that doesn't intersect my current path. If S0 attempts to follow me by moving L to (5, 7) at T46, I move L to (4, 7). S0 cannot intercept me at (3, 7) at T47 unless I turn back.\n\nLet's confirm the tail location. My snake is 12 segments long. Tail (1, 5) will vacate.\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 7), my segments are: (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6). Segment (1, 5) is now empty.\n\nThis path is clear and fast.\n\n**Revised Strategy Note:**\nS0 has claimed the disputed apple. I must secure the next quick apple. I choose LEFT to target (3, 7), which guarantees capture in 2 moves (T47) and is relatively safe from S0 interference, as S0 must traverse occupied space or move far away to compete. This helps close the 2-apple gap.\n\nLEFT",

I am behind by 2 apples.\n\n**Previous Move Context:** I moved LEFT from (5, 7) to (4, 7) aiming for the apple at (3, 7).\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safety for Snake 1 (Head at 4, 7):**\nMy adjacent cells:\n*   (4, 8): My body. UNSAFE (backwards move is (5, 7), (4, 8) is a body segment).\n*   (4, 6): Empty. SAFE.\n*   (3, 7): Apple. SAFE (Target).\n*   (5, 7): My body (directly behind the head). UNSAFE.\n\nSafe moves: UP (4, 8) is bad.

This is the intended capture.\n*   **RIGHT to (5, 7):** UNSAFE (My body, directly behind head).\n\n**2. Evaluate Conflict with Enemy Snake (S0 Head at 6, 6):**\n\nS0 is currently preoccupied far from (3, 7).\nS0 moved from (6, 7) to (6, 6) (DOWN or perhaps LEFT-DOWN movement towards the lower section). (6, 7) is now a body segment of S0.\n\nS0's possible moves from (6, 6):\n1.  UP to (6, 7): UNSAFE (S0 body/tail, if S0 kept length, which it did).\n2.  DOWN to (6, 5): SAFE.\n3.  LEFT to (5, 6): SAFE.\n4.  RIGHT to (7, 6): SAFE.\n\nS0 is unlikely to block me at (3, 7) this turn, which secures the capture.\n\n**3. Decision:**\nMoving LEFT to (3, 7) secures an apple, closing the score gap to 1 apple (11 vs 12). This is the immediate priority. The move is guaranteed safe and results in an apple capture.\n\n**Move: LEFT** (4, 7) -> (3, 7) (Eat Apple)\n\n**Long-term strategy note for Turn 48:**\nAfter eating at (3, 7), my head will be at (3, 7). My tail [(1, 6)] will remain for one turn. I will be 13 segments long. S0's head is (6, 6). The next closest apple is (5, 4). Distance from (3, 7) to (5, 4) is 4 moves (R, R, D, D or R, D, R, D).\n\nI need to assess S0's movement. If S0 moves DOWN/LEFT towards the center (e.g., (5, 6), (6, 5)), it will be aiming for (5, 4) or perhaps (8, 3). I must move aggressively towards (5, 4) after this capture. The direction from (3, 7) toward (5, 4) is generally RIGHT and DOWN.\n\nLEFT",

S0 also did not eat, and its tail (9, 0) vanished). Wait, the board state shows S0's body is 12 segments long plus the head (13 total). If S0 did not eat on T=47, its tail at (9, 0) should have vanished, and the body list confirms (9, 0) is not there.\n*   Body: [(6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0)]. (Wait, the provided body list for S0 is 12 segments, plus the head (6, 5) makes 13 segments. The tail *is* (9, 0). If S0 moved from (6, 6) to (6, 5) without eating, the tail should now be at (9, 1). Let me re-check the provided body state carefully:\n    S0 Body: [(6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (9, 0)]. Total 12.\n    Head (6, 5). Total length 13.\n    If S0 moved from (6, 6) to (6, 5) on T=47, and did NOT eat (apples=12 confirmed from prior turn), then (6, 6) becomes the new neck, and (9, 0) should vanish. This means the new tail should be (9, 1).\n    Since the provided state lists (9, 0) as the tail, I must assume S0 *did* eat on T=47, which contradicts the scores remaining 12. OR the state provided is an immediate post-move application of the move (6, 6) -> (6, 5) without proper tail handling based on whether an apple was consumed. Given the score is 12 and the board display shows no apple at (6, 5), I must assume S0 did not eat, and the tail cell (9, 0) *will* vacate this turn (T=48).\n\nApples Remaining: (9, 9), (0, 0), (5, 4), (8, 3), (1, 0).\nScores (ID 1: 11, ID 0: 12). I am behind by 1 apple.\n\n**Immediate Goal:** Get closer to the nearest available apple, which is (5, 4).\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safety for Snake 1 (Head at 3, 7):**\nMy adjacent cells:\n*   (3, 8): Empty. SAFE. (UP)\n*   (3, 6): Empty. SAFE. (DOWN)\n*   (2, 7): Empty. SAFE. (LEFT)\n*   (4, 7): My body (directly behind the head). UNSAFE. (RIGHT)\n\nSafe moves: UP (3, 8), DOWN (3, 6), LEFT (2, 7).\n\n**2. Evaluate Strategic Moves towards (5, 4):**\nI am at (3, 7). Target (5, 4).\n*   Path requires increasing X and decreasing Y.\n\nA. **Move UP to (3, 8):** Moves away from (5, 4) slightly (Distance 2+1=3 vs 2+3=5). But it keeps me high on the board.\nB. **Move DOWN to (3, 6):** Moves towards (5, 4). Next move can be RIGHT to (4, 6) or (5, 6). (Distance to apple (2, 2) = 4).\nC. **Move LEFT to (2, 7):** Moves away from (5, 4). Good if I wanted (0, 0) or (1, 0), but those are far. (Distance to apple (5, 4) is 3+3=6).\n\nMove DOWN (3, 6) seems optimal for reaching (5, 4) quickly.\n\n**3. Evaluate Conflict with Enemy Snake (S0 Head at 6, 5):**\nS0 is at (6, 5). Target (5, 4). Distance 1+1=2.\nMy position (3, 7). Target (5, 4). Distance 2+3=5.\nS0 is much closer to (5, 4). S0 will likely move to (5, 5) (LEFT) or (6, 4) (DOWN) to target (5, 4).\n\nS0 possible moves from (6, 5):\n1.  UP to (6, 6): UNSAFE (S0 body).\n2.  DOWN to (6, 4): Pathway towards (5, 4). S0 is 1 step away from reaching X=6, Y=4.\n3.  LEFT to (5, 5): DIRECT step towards (5, 4)'s column.\n4.  RIGHT to (7, 5): Safe, but moving away from (5, 4).\n\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (5, 5) or DOWN to (6, 4), they are positioning for (5, 4). S0 will very likely capture (5, 4) on T=49 or T=50.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (3, 6), S0 will still beat me to (5, 4).\n\nGiven S0's proximity to (5, 4), it's highly likely I will lose this apple. I should consider the next best option: (8, 3).\nMy (3, 7) to (8, 3): (5 R, 4 D) = 9 moves, Manhattan distance 5+4=9.\nS0 (6, 5) to (8, 3): (2 R, 2 D) = 4 moves, Manhattan distance 2+2=4.\nS0 is also closer to (8, 3). S0 will likely grab both (5, 4) and (8, 3) if I don't try to block or go for another area.\n\nWhat about (0, 0) or (1, 0)?\n(3, 7) to (1, 0): (2 L, 7 D) = 9 MD.\n(3, 7) to (0, 0): (3 L, 7 D) = 10 MD.\nThese are far, but uncontested.\n\n**Revisiting S0's movement and blocking potential:**\nS0 is blocking the central path. If I move DOWN to (3, 6) and then RIGHT to (4, 6) or (5, 6), I approach the area where S0 operates.\n\nIf I move **DOWN (3, 6)**:\nT=49 options: (2, 6), (4, 6), (3, 5). All safe.\nIf S0 goes (5, 5) -> (5, 4) (Eat, T=49). S0 is now at (5, 4).\n\nIf I move **LEFT (2, 7)**:\nT=49 options: (2, 6), (1, 7), (3, 7 - backwards). Safe move (2, 6) leads towards the lower left corner (0, 0, 1, 0).\n\nIf I move **UP (3, 8)**:\nT=49 options: (2, 8), (4, 8), (3, 7 - backwards). Safe move (4, 8) or (2, 8). This seems like a path to (9, 9) but is very long, or a way to get trapped by my massive body in the top left.\n\nSince I am behind by 1 apple and S0 is poised to score twice, I must maximize my efficiency. If (5, 4) is lost, I should pivot. The lower left apples, (0, 0) and (1, 0), are guaranteed to be mine if I go there, but it will take 8-10 turns.\n\nLet's stick to the center and see if I can interfere or scavenge. Moving DOWN to (3, 6) puts me on the diagonal path toward the central cluster of action, and it enables movement to the right (X increase).\n\n**Check for head-on collision risk if I move DOWN (3, 6):**\nS0 is at (6, 5). S0 could move to (5, 5), (6, 4), or (7, 5). None of these intersect (3, 6). Safe.\n\n**Rethink: Is there any way to grab (5, 4)?**\nI am at (3, 7). 5 moves away. S0 is at (6, 5). 2 moves away. No, S0 wins.\n\n**New Priority: Secure a guaranteed apple, even if distant, or move aggressively towards S0's path to interrupt them.**\n\nIf I move DOWN to (3, 6), and S0 moves to (5, 5) to grab (5, 4) next turn:\nT=48: Me (3, 6). S0 (5, 5).\nT=49: Me (4, 6) or (3, 5). S0 (5, 4) (Eats).\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 6) at T=49, I start setting up for (8, 3) after S0 has moved away from my path.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 7), I commit to the left side and (0, 0)/(1, 0).\nT=48: Me (2, 7). S0 (5, 5).\nT=49: Me (2, 6) or (1, 7). If (2, 6), I continue down the 2 column. I need 6-7 turns to get to (1, 0). S0 will get 2 apples (+2 points) in that time. Gap 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nIf I move DOWN (3, 6), I keep options open toward the right side.\n\nLet's assume S0 gets both (5, 4) and (8, 3). S0 score 14. I need to get apples 12, 13, 14, 15... to catch up.\n\nThe downside of going DOWN is that I potentially expose myself to S0 later when it moves away from (5, 4) and (8, 3).\n\nLet's analyze the density of my snake. My body segment (4, 7) is behind me. (5, 7) is adjacent to (4, 7). My body blocks the path $Y=7$ completely from X=1 to X=5.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (3, 6), I am safe and position myself to move right (towards 5, 4/8, 3 area after S0 clears) or down further.\n\nIf I choose to head to (1, 0) via LEFT (2, 7), it is a very safe long march, but I forfeit the opportunity to potentially steal the far corner apple (9, 9) if S0 goes low, or to capitalize if S0 makes a mistake near the center.\n\nGiven the current scenario, the conservative move is to move towards the least contested area, which is the lower left. However, moving DOWN keeps the center open for another turn before committing to the left or right side of the remaining map.\n\nLet's prioritize:\n1. Safety: All three moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT) are safe.\n2. Apple access: (5, 4) is highly contested. (8, 3) is contested. (1, 0) is relatively safe but distant.\n3. Positioning: Moving DOWN (3, 6) keeps me flexible towards the center. Moving LEFT (2, 7) commits heavily to the left pole, which is safer long-term if S0 is dominating the center/right.\n\nI will commit to the left side to secure the next available uncontested apples. S0 is powerful, and trying to fight it for contested apples might lead to death or wasted moves while S0 gathers points.\n\nMove LEFT to (2, 7).\nT=48: (2, 7). Tail (1, 6) vanishes. My body is now (3, 7). Length 12.\nNext steps: (2, 6), (2, 5)... towards (1, 0) or (0, 0).\n\n**Long-term strategy note for Turn 49:**\nMy snake is now positioned at (2, 7), targeting the apples in the lower left corner: (1, 0) and (0, 0). S0 is likely taking (5, 4) and (8, 3). I must prioritize moving DOWN along the X=2 or X=1 column to secure these uncontested points rapidly. I must ensure I do not trap myself in the NW corner of my own body mass. Current safe direction leads to (2, 6).\n\nLEFT",

Determine Immediate Safety for Snake 1 (Head at 2, 7):**\nMy adjacent cells:\n*   (2, 8): My body segment (2, 9) is there, but wait, let's trace the body carefully:\n    Head (2, 7). Neck (3, 7).\n    UP (2, 8): Empty. SAFE.\n    DOWN (2, 6): Empty. SAFE.\n    LEFT (1, 7): My tail is currently there, but it is vacating. SAFE. (This cell, (1, 7), will be empty *after* my move, unless I move there.) Ah, if I move onto (1, 7), it is my tail, and it is a safe move. SAFE.\n    RIGHT (3, 7): My body (neck). UNSAFE (Backwards move).\n\nSafe moves: UP (2, 8), DOWN (2, 6), LEFT (1, 7).\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Movement (S0 Head at 5, 5):**\nS0 is closest to (5, 4).\nS0 potential moves:\n*   (5, 6): UP. Safe.\n*   (5, 4): DOWN. **Eats apple (5, 4).** (Very likely)\n*   (4, 5): LEFT. Safe.\n*   (6, 5): Right into body (neck). UNSAFE.\n\nExpect S0 to move DOWN to (5, 4) this turn, claiming the apple and increasing score to 13.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves towards (1, 0) and (0, 0):**\nI am at (2, 7).\nA. **Move DOWN to (2, 6):** Optimal for reaching the bottom corner. Distance to (1, 0) is 1+6=7 moves.\nB. **Move LEFT to (1, 7):** Moves along the Y=7 axis. Still good for going down, perhaps slightly less direct than (2, 6). Next move would likely be (1, 6).\nC. **Move UP to (2, 8):** Moves away from current target apples significantly. Low priority.\n\nMoving DOWN to (2, 6) is the most direct path towards the required region of the map (Y=0, Y=1).\n\n**4. Check for Collisions/Traps:**\nI am moving into (2, 6). S0 is moving from (5, 5), likely to (5, 4). There is no conflict. The path is clear.\n\nMoving DOWN maintains flexibility and progress towards securing uncontested points.\n\n**Long-term strategy note for Turn 50 and beyond:**\nContinue moving toward the lower-left corner apples (1, 0) and (0, 0). After reaching (2, 6), subsequent moves should be (2, 5), (2, 4), (1, 4) or similar to navigate the lower map successfully. S0 is likely taking (5, 4) this turn and may then target (8, 3).

SAFE.\n*   RIGHT (3, 5): Empty. SAFE.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN (2, 4), LEFT (1, 5), RIGHT (3, 5).\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Movement (S0 Head at 5, 3):**\nS0 potential moves:\n*   (5, 2): DOWN. Safe.\n*   (4, 3): LEFT. Safe.\n*   (6, 3): RIGHT. Safe. (Leads towards (8, 3))\n*   (5, 4): Into body (neck). UNSAFE.\n\nIf S0 is targeting (8, 3) or (7, 1), they might move RIGHT (6, 3) or stay central/down (5, 2). If they continue moving away from their tail, DOWN (5, 2) is highly plausible. Moving LEFT (4, 3) is also possible to explore the lower-middle board. I will assume S0 continues towards the lower part of the board, perhaps aiming for the diagonal path to (7, 1).\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves towards (1, 0) and (0, 0):**\nI am at (2, 5). Target region is Y=0/1.\n\nA. **Move DOWN to (2, 4):** Direct path towards the target (Y=0, Y=1). Excellent progress.\nB. **Move LEFT to (1, 5):** Also good. Keeps me close to the left wall and offers a clear path down (1, 4), (1, 3), etc., to reach (1, 0) directly.\nC. **Move RIGHT to (3, 5):** Leads away from the target. Low priority.\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT are good.\n\n*   If I move DOWN (2, 4): Next turn I can move DOWN (2, 3) or LEFT (1, 4).\n*   If I move LEFT (1, 5): Next turn I can move DOWN (1, 4) or LEFT (0, 5) (along the wall).\n\nThe target apples (0, 0) and (1, 0) are very far down. Moving DOWN is crucial for vertical progress. Moving LEFT is good for positioning near the wall.\n\nGiven that my primary goal is vertical descent, DOWN (2, 4) is the most efficient move this turn. It also keeps me at a comfortable distance from S0 (S0 projected to 5, 2 or 6, 3 or 4, 3).\n\n**4. Check for Head-on Collisions:**\nMy intended move: (2, 5) -> (2, 4).\nS0 is at (5, 3). No risk of collision with S0's head or body segment this turn.\n\nIf I continue to (2, 4), I can then advance:\n(2, 4) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 1). Then move LEFT/DOWN to reach the apples. This looks like a clear path.\n\nMoving LEFT (1, 5) is slightly less direct, but might be safer if S0 decides to move rapidly towards the center. However, S0 is currently far right (X=5) and low (Y=3). Direct vertical progress is superior here.\n\nTherefore, DOWN is the optimal move.\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nCurrent target: (1, 0) and (0, 0). Continue moving DOWN the X=2 or X=1 axis until reaching the bottom edge. Secure these two apples to tie/take the lead. Then evaluate enemy position before choosing the next distant apple target (likely (7, 1) or (8, 3)).\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n\nIf S0 targets (8, 3), they will likely move RIGHT (7, 3) or UP (6, 4) then RIGHT.\nIf S0 targets (7, 1), they will likely move DOWN (6, 2).\n\nS0 is moving away from my area (X=2). I should focus on maximizing my progress toward (0, 0) and (1, 0).\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves towards (1, 0) and (0, 0):**\nI am at (2, 4). I need to decrease Y to 0 and/or X to 0/1.\n\nA. **Move DOWN to (2, 3):** Direct vertical progress. Excellent. From here I can continue down (2, 2) and (2, 1).\nB. **Move LEFT to (1, 4):** Positions me on the X=1 axis, directly adjacent to the path to (1, 0) and (0, 0). Good.\nC. **Move RIGHT to (3, 4):** Moves me away from the target. Worst option.\n\nComparing DOWN (2, 3) and LEFT (1, 4):\n*   (2, 3) allows for 3 more vertical moves until Y=0.\n*   (1, 4) allows for 4 more vertical moves until Y=0.\nIf I go LEFT (1, 4), I can follow the path: (1, 4) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0) [EAT]. This is 5 moves to the first apple.\nIf I go DOWN (2, 3), I can follow: (2, 3) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0) [EAT]. This is also 5 moves (3 down, 1 left, 1 down).\n\nHowever, moving LEFT now secures the optimal path down the X=1 column. If I stay at X=2, I might risk getting trapped by my own segments or needing to block off X=1 unexpectedly if S0 tried to reach it. Given the proximity to the left edge, moving LEFT seems slightly more efficient for long-term commitment to the left edge apples.\n\nLet's check the board constraints and dangers:\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 4):\nNext turn, I can move DOWN (1, 3), LEFT (0, 4) or UP (1, 5 - into neck).\n*   (0, 4) is safe and opens the way to (0, 0).\n*   (1, 3) continues the direct route down.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 3):\nNext turn, I can move DOWN (2, 2), LEFT (1, 3) or RIGHT (3, 3).\n(1, 3) is a good spot, but moving LEFT now puts me there faster if I choose the X=1 path.\n\nSince I am targeting (1, 0) and (0, 0), getting to X=1 or X=0 sooner is better. Moving LEFT (1, 4) achieves this and lines me up for a straightforward vertical drop down the X=1 column.\n\n**4. Check for Head-on Collisions:**\nMy intended move: (2, 4) -> (1, 4).\nS0 is at (6, 3). No collision risk.\n\nMoving LEFT is the optimal move to commit to the lower-left target area.\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nCurrent target: (1, 0) and (0, 0). Move LEFT to (1, 4) to align with the X=1 column. Then continue moving DOWN until reaching the apples. Secure these two apples to tie/take the lead. After securing the left corner, evaluate the fastest path to (7, 1) or (8, 3).\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nLEFT",

I am behind by 2 apples.\n\n**Immediate Goal:** Secure the lower-left apples ((1, 0) and (0, 0)). I successfully aligned myself on the X=1 axis.\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safety for Snake 1 (Head at 1, 4):**\nMy adjacent cells:\n*   UP (1, 5): Empty. SAFE.\n*   DOWN (1, 3): Empty. SAFE.\n*   LEFT (0, 4): Empty. SAFE.\n*   RIGHT (2, 4): My body (neck). UNSAFE (Backwards move).\n\nSafe moves: UP (1, 5), DOWN (1, 3), LEFT (0, 4).\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Movement (S0 Head at 7, 3):**\nS0 is close to (8, 3) and (7, 1).\nPossible moves for S0:\n*   UP (7, 4): Empty.\n*   DOWN (7, 2): Empty.\n*   LEFT (6, 3): S0 body (neck). UNSAFE.\n*   RIGHT (8, 3): APPLE (8, 3)! If S0 moves RIGHT, they will eat.\n\nIt is highly probable S0 moves RIGHT to (8, 3) and eats this turn. This means S0's tail (9, 4) will remain, and S0 will be length 15.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves towards (1, 0) and (0, 0):**\nI am at (1, 4). Target apples are (1, 0) and (0, 0).\n\nA. **Move DOWN to (1, 3):** Direct vertical progress towards (1, 0).\nB. **Move LEFT to (0, 4):** Direct horizontal progress towards the X=0 access path for (0, 0).\nC. **Move UP to (1, 5):** Moving away from the current target. Only useful if forced to avoid a trap, which is not the case here.\n\nComparing DOWN (1, 3) and LEFT (0, 4):\nThe apple (1, 0) is 4 steps away using the vertical path: (1, 4) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 0) (EAT).\nIf I move DOWN (1, 3): I maintain the path toward (1, 0). This is the fastest route to my first apple target.\n\nIf I move LEFT (0, 4): I commit to the (0, Y) column. From (0, 4) I would go (0, 3) -> (0, 2) -> (0, 1) -> (0, 0) (EAT). This is 4 steps to (0, 0).\n\nSince both paths require 4 moves to reach an apple, I should choose the move that keeps me most flexible or minimizes future risks.\n\n*Path DOWN (1, 3):*\nNext potential moves: (1, 2), (0, 3), (2, 3). Excellent flexibility.\n\n*Path LEFT (0, 4):*\nNext potential moves: (0, 3) or (0, 5) (or (1, 4) if it's safe). Going to (0, 4) puts me on the boundary of the board, which slightly reduces options compared to staying central at X=1. However, X=0 is the direct route to (0, 0).\n\nThe apple at (1, 0) is slightly easier to integrate into a continuous run since I can follow up by going LEFT to (0, 0) from (1, 0) or (1, 1).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (1, 3), I secure the vertical drop.\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 4), I commit to the left wall.\n\nLet's stick to the simplest, most direct vertical route to the closest accessible apple: (1, 0).\n\nMove DOWN to (1, 3).\n\n**4. Check for New Trapping/Collision Risks:**\nMy move: (1, 4) -> (1, 3).\nS0 is likely moving to (8, 3). No risk of collision.\nMy body position: The body segments are all concentrated further up and to the right (starting at (2, 4)). Moving down gives me clear space.\n\nThe move DOWN is optimal for commitment to (1, 0).\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nCurrent target is (1, 0), followed by (0, 0). Continue moving DOWN the X=1 column to reach (1, 0). After eating (1, 0), proceed to (0, 0). Keep an eye on S0, who is likely consuming apples (8, 3) and possibly (7, 1) next. I need to secure two apples quickly to regain the lead.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",

It keeps options open for moving down afterward toward the apple at (7,1) or pivoting away from the right wall.\n- UP is safer than LEFT but worse than RIGHT for apple collection and could start to box me in.\n- DOWN is reasonable for the (7,1) apple, but it sacrifices the immediate apple and tempo.\n\nShort plan for next turns (before final move):\n- Take the apple at (8,3) now. After eating, reassess: prefer to move down toward (7,1) (via 7,2\u21927,1) while avoiding getting trapped against the x=9 wall and my own body.

Or LEFT (0, 2) towards (0, 0).\nThis maintains maximum flexibility for the next turn.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 3):\nNext turn: I could only go DOWN (0, 2) towards (0, 0) or potentially RIGHT (1, 3 - which is now free) or UP (0, 4 - which is free). Moving LEFT right now restricts the ability to switch to (1, 0) easily if something changes (though the apple is (1, 0) not (1, 1)).\n\nThe apple (1, 0) is a direct vertical line. The apple (0, 0) requires two turns of vertical movement and one turn of horizontal movement, regardless of whether I use DOWN first or LEFT first.\n\nPath 1: (1, 3) -> DOWN (1, 2) -> DOWN (1, 1) -> DOWN (1, 0) [EAT] (3 moves, 1 apple)\nPath 2: (1, 3) -> LEFT (0, 3) -> DOWN (0, 2) -> DOWN (0, 1) -> DOWN (0, 0) [EAT] (4 moves, 1 apple) -- Wait, Path 2 distance: (1, 3) to (0, 0) is 1+3=4 Manhattan distance.\n(1, 3) -> LEFT (0, 3) (1)\n(0, 3) -> DOWN (0, 2) (2)\n(0, 2) -> DOWN (0, 1) (3)\n(0, 1) -> LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN\n(0, 1) -> DOWN (0, 0) [EAT] (4) (Mistake in previous step calculation for 4 moves. It is 4 steps if I use 1 horizontal + 3 vertical).\n\nPath to (1, 0): 3 moves.\nPath to (0, 0): 4 moves (e.g., DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN). Or (1, 3) -> LEFT (0, 3) -> DOWN (0, 2) -> DOWN (0, 1) -> DOWN (0, 0). Still 4 steps.\n\nSince (1, 0) is only 3 steps away and (0, 0) is 4 steps away, targeting (1, 0) is the faster solution.\n\nMove DOWN to (1, 2). This keeps me on the fastest route to (1, 0).\n\n**4. Check for New Trapping/Collision Risks:**\nMy move: (1, 3) -> (1, 2).\nS0 is far away and likely moving around X=8, Y=3. No collision risk.\nMy tail will vacate (4, 9). Moving DOWN maintains open space around me.\n\nThe move DOWN is optimal.\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nCurrent target is (1, 0). Move DOWN to (1, 2), then (1, 1), and then EAT at (1, 0). After eating (1, 0), move LEFT along Y=0 to (0, 0) to secure the second apple. If S0 continues dominance, securing these two apples is crucial for keeping pace.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",

I am behind by 3 apples.\n\n**Immediate Goal:** Secure the lower-left apples ((1, 0) and (0, 0)). I am currently 2 steps away from (1, 0).\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safety for Snake 1 (Head at 1, 2):**\nMy adjacent cells:\n*   UP (1, 3): My body (neck). UNSAFE (Backwards move).\n*   DOWN (1, 1): Empty. SAFE.\n*   LEFT (0, 2): Empty. SAFE.\n*   RIGHT (2, 2): Empty. SAFE.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN (1, 1), LEFT (0, 2), RIGHT (2, 2).\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Movement (S0 Head at 8, 4):**\nS0 is close to apple (6, 4) (3 steps away: (8, 4) -> (7, 4) -> (6, 4) if path is clear).\nS0 is also near (7, 1) (Manhattan distance 4).\n\nS0's adjacent cells:\n*   UP (8, 5): Empty.\n*   DOWN (8, 3): S0 body (neck). UNSAFE.\n*   LEFT (7, 4): Empty. Towards (6, 4).\n*   RIGHT (9, 4): Empty. Towards its tail area.\n\nGiven S0's position and the close proximity of (6, 4), S0 is overwhelmingly likely to move LEFT (7, 4) or UP (8, 5).\nIf S0 goes LEFT (7, 4), they are on track for (6, 4).\nIf S0 goes UP (8, 5), they are moving towards (9, 9).\n\nS0 poses no immediate collision threat to me.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves towards (1, 0) and (0, 0):**\nI am at (1, 2). Target Apple (1, 0) is 2 steps away. Target Apple (0, 0) is 3 steps away (e.g., L, D, D).\n\nA. **Move DOWN to (1, 1):** This is the direct, shortest path to (1, 0).\n(1, 2) -> DOWN (1, 1) (1 step)\n(1, 1) -> DOWN (1, 0) [EAT] (2 steps total).\nThis secures an apple next turn.\n\nB. **Move LEFT to (0, 2):** This moves me closer to (0, 0), but it requires one extra turn to reach (1, 0).\nPath to (0, 0): (1, 2) -> LEFT (0, 2) -> DOWN (0, 1) -> DOWN (0, 0) [EAT] (3 steps total).\nThis secures an apple in 3 steps.\n\nC. **Move RIGHT to (2, 2):** Moves away from current targets. Not productive now.\n\nSince I am behind in score, securing the fastest apple is critical. Moving DOWN allows me to eat (1, 0) on the next turn (Turn 56).\n\n**4. Check for New Trapping/Collision Risks:**\nMoving DOWN (1, 1) is a non-trapping move, as it keeps me on the border wall with plenty of space in the corner. S0 is far away. No risks identified.\n\nThe move DOWN is optimal for securing (1, 0) quickly.\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nTarget 1: (1, 0). Move DOWN to (1, 1) now, eat (1, 0) next turn (T56).\nTarget 2: (0, 0). After eating (1, 0), move LEFT along Y=0 to secure (0, 0) on T57.\nThis strategy should secure 2 apples rapidly and catch up to S0's score.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",

The previous tail segment (4, 8) is now empty.\n*   My snake's tail segment (5, 8) will vacate this turn since I did not eat last turn.\n\nEnemy Snake (ID 0):\n*   Head: (7, 4). Length: 15 (Moved LEFT from (8, 4) last turn. Based on the previous rationale, S0 likely moved toward (6, 4)).\n*   Body: [(8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6)].\n*   S0's tail segment (9, 6) will vacate this turn since S0 did not eat last turn (If S0 was at (8,4) and moved to (7,4), it did not eat (6,4) yet).\n\nApples Remaining: (9, 9), (0, 0), (1, 0), (7, 1), (6, 4).\nScores (ID 1: 11, ID 0: 14). I am behind by 3 apples.\n\n**Immediate Goal:** Eat apple (1, 0).\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safety for Snake 1 (Head at 1, 1):**\nMy adjacent cells:\n*   UP (1, 2): My body (neck). UNSAFE (Backwards move).\n*   DOWN (1, 0): Apple 'A'. SAFE. EATING MOVE.\n*   LEFT (0, 1): Empty. SAFE, but leads away from the immediate apple.\n*   RIGHT (2, 1): Empty. SAFE, but leads away from the immediate apple.\n\nThe move DOWN (1, 0) is safe, and it results in eating an apple.\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Movement (S0 Head at 7, 4):**\nS0 is at (7, 4). The closest apple is (6, 4).\nS0's adjacent cells:\n*   UP (7, 5): Empty.\n*   DOWN (7, 3): S0 body (neck). UNSAFE.\n*   LEFT (6, 4): Apple 'A'. S0 is overwhelmingly likely to move LEFT and eat the apple (6, 4).\n*   RIGHT (8, 4): S0 body. UNSAFE (Backwards move).\n\nS0 will almost certainly move LEFT to (6, 4) and eat the apple there. This means S0 will not pose any collision threat to my current position (1, 1).\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves towards Apples:**\nMove DOWN to (1, 0) is the best choice:\n1. It is safe.\n2. It secures an apple immediately, bringing my score to 12 and closing the gap with S0 (who will also likely eat this turn).\n\n**4. Check for New Trapping/Collision Risks:**\nAfter moving to (1, 0), my head is at the bottom corner. The tail segment (5, 8) will be vacated. My length increases to 14.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T57 onward):**\nAfter eating (1, 0), I will be at (1, 0). The next apple is (0, 0), one step away.\n1. Turn 57: Move LEFT to (0, 0) and eat the second apple.\n2. After securing (1, 0) and (0, 0), my snake will be long and positioned in the bottom-left corner. I will have caught up to S0's expected score (15 each).\n3. The next closest apples are (7, 1) and then potentially the distant (9, 9). Given the size of my snake, I should start pathfinding towards (7, 1) or consolidate position.\n\nThe move DOWN is mandatory this turn.\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nTarget 1 (T56): (1, 0). Move DOWN. (EAT)\nTarget 2 (T57): (0, 0). Move LEFT. (EAT)\nTarget 3 (T58+): After securing the corner, start moving towards (7, 1) or head up towards the open area, prioritizing safe movement away from the growing S0.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",

Coordinates (0,0) to (9,9).\nMy Snake (ID 1):\n*   Head: (1, 0).\n*   Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8)]. Length: 13 (Moved DOWN, ate apple (1, 0) last turn, if the last rationale was correct). **Correction**: My body list includes 12 segments after the head, so my total length is 13 segments. The previous length was 13. Since I moved to (1, 0), and (1, 0) was listed as an apple in the previous turn's state, I *should* have eaten.\n    *Last turn's state showed apples at: (9, 9), (0, 0), (1, 0), (7, 1), (6, 4).*\n    *Current turn's state shows apples at: (9, 9), (0, 0), (7, 1), (8, 2), (7, 8).*\n    Since (1, 0) is no longer an apple, and my head is at (1, 0), I successfully ate it. My length should be 14.\n    *Head (1, 0) + Body (12 segments including (1, 1) to (5, 8)) = 13 segments.*\n    Wait, if I ate, the tail (5, 8) would stay.\n\n    Let's re-verify my length and segments:\n    Head: (1, 0)\n    Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 8)]\n    Total segments: 1 + 12 = 13.\n    If I ate (1, 0) last turn, my length should have increased from 13 to 14. However, the body list only shows 12 segments *after* the head. This suggests the game state *already* recorded the new head (1, 0) and the original body (12 segments), and the tail (5, 8) was retained, making the total length 13+1 = 14. Let's assume my current total length is 14.\n*   Apples collected: 12. (Up from 11).\n\nEnemy Snake (ID 0):\n*   Head: (6, 4).\n*   Body: [(7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6)]. Length: 16 total segments.\n*   Apples collected: 15. (Up from 14. S0 likely ate (6, 4) last turn).\n\nApples Remaining: (9, 9), (0, 0), (7, 1), (8, 2), (7, 8).\nScores: ID 1: 12, ID 0: 15. I am behind by 3 apples.\n\n**Immediate Goal:** Eat apple (0, 0). It is right next to my head (1, 0).\n\n**1. Determine Immediate Safety for Snake 1 (Head at 1, 0):**\nMy adjacent cells:\n*   UP (1, 1): My body (neck). UNSAFE (Backwards move).\n*   DOWN (1, -1): Off board. FATAL.\n*   LEFT (0, 0): Apple 'A'. SAFE. EATING MOVE.\n*   RIGHT (2, 0): Empty. SAFE, but away from the apple.\n\nThe move LEFT (0, 0) is safe, and it results in eating an apple.\n\n**2. Analyze Enemy Movement (S0 Head at 6, 4):**\nS0 is at (6, 4). S0 just ate here, making its length 16.\nS0 is large and centrally located. The next closest apples for S0 are (7, 1), (8, 2), or (7, 8).\n\nS0 adjacent cells:\n*   UP (6, 5): S0 body. UNSAFE (Backwards move).\n*   DOWN (6, 3): S0 body. UNSAFE.\n*   LEFT (5, 4): S0 body. UNSAFE.\n*   RIGHT (7, 4): S0 body (neck). UNSAFE.\n\nWait, S0 is entirely surrounded by its own body segments!\nS0 Head (6, 4).\nBody segments around (6, 4):\n(7, 4) - Neck, first segment.\n(6, 3) - S0 body.\n(5, 4) - S0 body.\n(6, 5) - S0 body.\n\nUnless S0's tail vacated one of those spots, S0 is trapped and will die this turn!\n\nLet's check S0's body segments again:\nBody: [(7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6)]\nS0 Length: 16 (Head + 15 body segments). S0 ate last turn, so the tail (9, 6) is retained.\n\nThe neighbors of S0 Head (6, 4) are:\n*   (6, 5): S0 body segment. (Index 9 in body)\n*   (6, 3): S0 body segment. (Index 5 in body)\n*   (5, 4): S0 body segment. (Index 7 in body)\n*   (7, 4): S0 body segment (Neck). (Index 1 in body)\n\nS0 has no safe move and must collide with its own body! S0 will die this turn.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves towards Apples (Vulture/Winning move):**\nIf S0 dies, I win immediately if I survive.\n\nMy move LEFT to (0, 0) is safe and eats an apple, increasing my score to 13 and my length to 15.\n\nIf I move LEFT:\n*   Head (0, 0).\n*   I survive.\n*   S0 dies.\n*   I win the game.\n\nIf I choose any other safe move (RIGHT to (2, 0)):\n*   Head (2, 0).\n*   I survive.\n*   S0 dies.\n*   I win the game.\n\nHowever, moving LEFT secures an apple I intended to take anyway. This is the optimal move.\n\n**4. Check for New Trapping/Collision Risks:**\nThere are no risks associated with moving LEFT to (0, 0). S0's death makes future planning unnecessary for this turn.\n\n**Conclusion:** Move LEFT to eat the apple and secure the win due to S0's pending self-collision fatality.\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nNot needed, I expect to win this turn.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\nLEFT",
