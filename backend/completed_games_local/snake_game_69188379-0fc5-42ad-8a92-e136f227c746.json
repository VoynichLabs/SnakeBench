          "move": "LEFT",
          "rationale": "First, I need to understand the current board state and my position. My snake (ID 0) is at (3, 3) with no body. The apples are at (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 7), (7, 2), and (1, 3). Enemy snake #1 is at (0, 0) with no body. The board is 10x10, and coordinates go from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right.\n\nIt's turn 0, and I need to make my first move. Since I have no body, moving backwards into myself isn't an issue yet. I must avoid moving off the board or into another snake's body.\n\nLet me list the possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n- My current position: (3, 3)\n\n- UP: (3, 4) \u2013 Is there an apple? Apples are at (1,4), (2,4), (3,7), etc. (3,4) is not listed as an apple. Check board: row 4 has apples at (1,4) and (2,4), so (3,4) should be empty? From the board state:\n\n  - Row 4: . A A . . . . . . . so positions: (0,4) ., (1,4) A, (2,4) A, (3,4) ., etc. So (3,4) is empty. Also, no snakes there. Snake #1 is at (0,0), which is far away. So UP to (3,4) seems safe.\n\n- DOWN: (3, 2) \u2013 From board, row 2: . . . . . . . A . . so (3,2) is empty. But wait, let's confirm the board state. The board is given as:\n\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 7 . . . A . . . . . .\n\n 6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 4 . A A . . . . . . .\n\n 3 . A . 0 . . . . . .\n\n 2 . . . . . . . A . .\n\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 0 1 . . . . . . . . .\n\nAnd coordinates: bottom left is (0,0), top right is (9,9). So the rows are from top to bottom? Let's see: it says \"9\" at top, then down to \"0\" at bottom. In the coordinate system, (0,0) is bottom left, so y=0 is bottom, y=9 is top. In the board display, row 9 is top, row 0 is bottom, so the y-coordinate in the board matches the coordinate y-value. So for row y, x from 0 to 9.\n\nSo for DOWN from (3,3) to (3,2): y=2, x=3. From board row 2: . . . . . . . A . . so positions: x=0: ., x=1: ., x=2: ., x=3: ., x=4: ., x=5: ., x=6: ., x=7: A, x=8: ., x=9: . So (3,2) is empty. Safe.\n\n- LEFT: (2, 3) \u2013 From row 3: . A . 0 . . . . . . so at x=2, y=3: it's . (since it's the third character: . A . 0, so index 0: ., 1: A, 2: ., 3: 0, etc.). So (2,3) is empty. But there is an apple at (1,3)? Apples are at (1,3), but (1,3) is x=1,y=3, not (2,3). So (2,3) is safe.\n\n- RIGHT: (4, 3) \u2013 From row 3: . A . 0 . . . . . . so after 0, it's ., so x=4,y=3 is empty. Safe.\n\nSo all four moves seem safe in terms of immediate collision with snakes or walls. But I need to consider the enemy snake. Enemy snake #1 is at (0,0). Since it's turn 0, and it has no body, it will move in some direction. I don't know what it will do, but I should consider possibilities.\n\nAlso, I should consider apples. I want to eat apples to grow and score. The closest apples are (1,3) and (1,4), (2,4). (1,3) is left and down? From (3,3), (1,3) is left two units. (1,4) is left and up, etc.\n\nBut since I need to choose one move now, I should think about which move sets me up for future moves.\n\nLet me list the apples:\n\n- (1,4) and (2,4) are adjacent to each other, at y=4, x=1 and x=2.\n\n- (1,3) is at y=3, x=1.\n\n- (3,7) is far up.\n\n- (7,2) is down-right.\n\nSo the cluster near me is (1,3), (1,4), (2,4). From (3,3), I can go LEFT to (2,3) which is close to (1,3) and also to (1,4) and (2,4) by going up later.\n\nBut I need to avoid potential head-on collisions. Since enemy snake might move, I don't know where it will go. But from (0,0), it can only move to (1,0) or (0,1) since down and left would be off board? Coordinates: from (0,0), possible moves: RIGHT to (1,0), UP to (0,1), but not LEFT or DOWN because x=0, y=0 are edges.\n\nSo enemy snake can only move RIGHT or UP. If it moves RIGHT, to (1,0), or UP to (0,1). Neither directly affects me now, but in future turns, if it grows, it might become a threat.\n\nBut for now, all my moves seem safe. I need to choose one that increases my chance of eating apples.\n\nLet me consider the apples one by one.\n\nThe apple at (1,3) is only one cell left from (2,3). So if I move LEFT to (2,3), then on next turn, I can move LEFT again to (1,3) to eat the apple. But I have to ensure that during that move, I don't collide with anything.\n\nSimilarly, if I move UP to (3,4), I might go towards (3,7) but that's far, or towards (2,4) or (1,4) but from (3,4), (2,4) is left, which is an apple, and (1,4) is further left. But (2,4) is adjacent to (3,4) only if I go left, but from (3,4), left to (2,4) is an apple, so I can eat it if I go left after moving up.\n\nBut let's think about immediate benefits. I don't get any apple for this move since none of the moves directly hit an apple. So I need to position myself for next turn.\n\nAlso, I should consider the enemy snake's potential moves. Since it's at (0,0), and it might move to (1,0) or (0,1), both are away from me, so no immediate risk of head-on collision.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, the enemy snake moves simultaneously, so if I move to a cell that the enemy might move to, we could collide if both heads move to the same cell. But from (0,0), it can only go to (1,0) or (0,1), which are not where I'm going unless I also go there. For example, if I move DOWN to (3,2), that's not near (1,0) or (0,1). Similarly for other moves. So no risk for this turn.\n\nBut in future turns, if I go towards the apples on the left, and the enemy goes up, it might come towards me later, but for now, it's not an issue.\n\nNow, back to apples. The cluster on the left: (1,3), (1,4), (2,4). From my position (3,3), if I go LEFT to (2,3), I am closer to (1,3) and also to (1,4) and (2,4) via UP moves.\n\nIf I go UP to (3,4), I am closer to (2,4) and (1,4) but not directly to (1,3). From (3,4), I can go LEFT to (2,4) to eat an apple, but (2,4) is an apple, so I can eat it immediately on the next turn if I move there.\n\nSimilarly, from (2,3), I can go UP to (2,4) to eat an apple, or LEFT to (1,3) to eat an apple.\n\nSo both LEFT and UP seem good for reaching apples quickly.\n\nBut let's see the distance: from (3,3) to (2,4): if I go UP then LEFT, or LEFT then UP? Actually, from (3,3), to reach (2,4), I need one move left and one move up, in any order. Similarly, to (1,3), I need two moves left.\n\nNow, the apples at (2,4) and (1,4) are adjacent, so if I can reach one, I might eat both in sequence.\n\nBut I also have to consider that after eating an apple, I grow, so my body will have a segment. That might affect future moves.\n\nSince I have no body now, after eating an apple, I will have a body of length 1, which means when I move, the tail will move forward, so I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nBut for the next move, since I have no body, moving backwards won't be an issue until I have a body.\n\nSo for now, all moves are safe.\n\nNow, which move to choose? I should consider which move gives me the most options for next turns.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2,3), from there I can go:\n\n- LEFT to (1,3) to eat apple at (1,3)\n\n- UP to (2,4) to eat apple at (2,4)\n\n- RIGHT back to (3,3) but that might not be useful\n\n- DOWN to (2,2) which is empty from board? Row 2: . . . . . . . A . . so at x=2,y=2 is ., so empty.\n\nSo from (2,3), I have two apple moves: LEFT and UP.\n\nIf I move UP to (3,4), from there I can go:\n\n- LEFT to (2,4) to eat apple at (2,4)\n\n- UP to (3,5) which is empty? Row 5: . . . . . . . . . . so all empty, so (3,5) is empty.\n\n- RIGHT to (4,4) empty? Row 4: . A A . . . . . . so x=4,y=4 is ., so empty.\n\n- DOWN back to (3,3)\n\nSo from (3,4), I can go LEFT to eat an apple immediately.\n\nSimilarly, if I move DOWN to (3,2), from there I can go:\n\n- LEFT to (2,2) empty\n\n- RIGHT to (4,2) empty? Row 2: . . . . . . . A . . so x=4,y=2 is ., so empty.\n\n- UP to (3,3) back\n\n- DOWN to (3,1) empty? Row 1: . . . . . . . . . . so empty.\n\nBut there is an apple at (7,2), which is far, so not immediately reachable.\n\nSimilarly, if I move RIGHT to (4,3), from there I can go:\n\n- UP to (4,4) empty? Row 4: . A A . . . . . . so x=4,y=4 is ., so empty.\n\n- DOWN to (4,2) empty\n\n- LEFT to (3,3) back\n\n- RIGHT to (5,3) empty\n\nBut no immediate apples nearby except (7,2) which is far.\n\nSo, the moves towards the left and up seem more promising because of the apple cluster.\n\nNow, between LEFT and UP, which one?\n\nIf I go LEFT to (2,3), I am closer to both (1,3) and (2,4). Specifically, from (2,3), I can eat (1,3) in one move, or (2,4) in one move.\n\nIf I go UP to (3,4), I can eat (2,4) in one move by going LEFT, but I cannot eat (1,3) directly; I would need to go LEFT twice from (3,4) to reach (1,3), but from (3,4) to (2,4) to (1,4) or to (1,3)? From (2,4), I can go DOWN to (2,3) then LEFT to (1,3), but that takes two moves after eating (2,4), so I might lose time.\n\nBut since I can eat (2,4) immediately from (3,4), that might be good.\n\nAlso, if I go LEFT to (2,3), I can eat (1,3) immediately or (2,4) immediately.\n\nBut let's see the apples: there is an apple at (1,3) and also at (1,4) and (2,4). So from (2,3), if I eat (1,3), I grow, but then my body will be at (2,3) after I move to (1,3)? Let's think about how growth works.\n\nWhen I move onto an apple, I grow by one segment. That means that after I move to the apple cell, my body adds a segment. Specifically, since I have no body now, when I move to an apple, my head moves to the apple, and then my body consists of my previous head position? In snake games, when you eat an apple, your snake grows by one segment, meaning that the tail does not move forward in that turn, so the body becomes longer.\n\nTypically, in snake, if you have no body, and you move to an apple, after the move, your head is on the apple, and your body has one segment which is your previous head position. But since you moved, the previous head position becomes the first body segment, and the tail is that same segment since there was no tail before? Actually, with no body, after eating, you have a body of length 1.\n\nBut in terms of coordinate list, from the description: \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one, and the last tuple is the tail.\"\n\nSo initially, for me, body is none, so the list is just [(3,3)].\n\nAfter I move to an apple, if I move to (1,3) and it has an apple, then after the move, my head is at (1,3), and I have a body segment, which is my previous head position (3,3)? But when I move, the head moves, and if I don't eat, the body follows: the tail moves to where the body was, etc. But when I eat, I grow, so the tail does not move; instead, a new segment is added.\n\nIn terms of coordinates: after moving to an apple, the new head is at the apple, and the old head becomes the first body segment, and since there was no body, now I have one body segment: the old head position.\n\nBut in the move, when I move, the head moves to the new cell, and if I eat, the body grows by adding the old head position as a new segment, so the tail remains where it was? With no body, after eating, the body becomes [old head], so the tail is at the old head.\n\nBut in this case, since I have no body, after moving to an apple, my snake becomes: head at new position, body: [old head], so two segments in total.\n\nBut for collision, when I move, I need to ensure that the new head cell is empty or has an apple, and that I don't collide with my own body or others.\n\nNow, back to decision.\n\nI think both LEFT and UP are good, but let's see which one might have less risk from the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (0,0), and it might move towards the apples? But from (0,0), it can only go to (1,0) or (0,1), which are not near the apples yet. The apples are at y=3 or4, so it might take several turns for the enemy to reach them.\n\nBut if I go LEFT, I am moving towards the enemy's potential path? The enemy might go up to (0,1), then to (0,2), etc., but that would be towards the left side, but the apples are at x=1 or2, so if the enemy goes up, it might not reach the apples quickly.\n\nAlternatively, if the enemy goes right, it goes to (1,0), then it might go up to (1,1), etc., which could eventually reach the apples, but since apples are at y=3 and4, it might take time.\n\nBut for now, it's turn 0, so I should focus on getting apples quickly.\n\nAnother thing: the board has 10x10, and I need to avoid getting trapped. Moving left might lead me towards the edge, but since I'm at x=3, moving left to x=2 is fine, and I have room to move right or up later.\n\nSimilarly, moving up to y=4, I have room to move down later.\n\nSo both seem safe.\n\nNow, I recall that in the apples list, there is (1,3) which is directly left from (2,3), and (1,4) which is up-left from (2,3), etc.\n\nBut let's think about the most efficient way to eat multiple apples. The apples at (1,4) and (2,4) are adjacent, so if I can reach one, I can eat both in two turns if I go directly.\n\nFrom (3,3), if I go UP to (3,4), then LEFT to (2,4), I eat one apple at (2,4). Then from (2,4), I can go LEFT to (1,4) to eat another apple? But (1,4) is an apple, so yes, I can eat both in two moves after moving UP.\n\nBut from (3,3) to (3,4) to (2,4) to (1,4), that's three moves from start? From (3,3) to (3,4) first move, then to (2,4) second move (eat one apple), then to (1,4) third move (eat another apple). But after eating at (2,4), I grow, so my body will be at (3,4) after I move to (2,4)? Let's simulate.\n\nStart: head at (3,3), no body.\n\nMove 1: if I go UP to (3,4). Since (3,4) has no apple, I don't grow. So after move, head at (3,4), body: [ (3,3) ]? But when I move without eating, the body follows: the tail moves to where the body was, but since no body, what happens? In snake with no body, when you move, you just move the head, and since no body, there is no tail to move? So after moving to (3,4), my snake should be just head at (3,4), no body? But that seems odd because normally, when you have no body, after moving, you still have no body until you eat an apple.\n\nIn standard snake, if you have length 1, when you move, you only move the head, and there is no body, so you remain length 1. So after moving, you still have no body.\n\nSo for me, after moving to (3,4) without eating, I still have no body? But from the description, \"Your snake (ID 0): Head: (3,3), Body: none\" so initially length 1. After moving without eating, it should still be length 1, so no body.\n\nBut when you eat an apple, you grow to length 2.\n\nSo in this case, if I move to (3,4) without eating, after the move, I have no body, head at (3,4).\n\nThen on next move, if I move LEFT to (2,4), and if (2,4) has an apple, I eat it, so after that move, my head is at (2,4), and I have a body segment: my previous head position (3,4). So now I have body: [ (3,4) ], head at (2,4).\n\nThen on the next move, if I move LEFT to (1,4), and if (1,4) has an apple, I eat it, so I grow again. After moving to (1,4), head at (1,4), and I add another body segment, so body becomes [ (2,4), (3,4) ]? But since I moved, the body follows: when I move from (2,4) to (1,4), if I eat, the tail does not move, so the body remains as [ (3,4) ]? No, let's think carefully.\n\nStandard snake mechanics: each turn, the head moves to a new cell. If the new cell has an apple, the snake grows, meaning that the tail does not move this turn, so the body becomes longer by one segment. The new body is: new head, then old head, then old body, etc.\n\nSo initially: head at H, body empty.\n\nAfter moving to a new cell without eating: head at new position, body remains empty? But if body was empty, after moving, should body be empty? In terms of length, if length was 1, after moving without eating, length remains 1, so no body.\n\nAfter moving with eating: head at new position, body becomes [old head], so length 2.\n\nThen after another move with eating: head moves to newer position, body becomes [newer head? No.\n\nLet's clarify with coordinates.\n\nTurn 0: snake has head at H0, no body.\n\nTurn 1: moves to H1. If no apple, then after move, head at H1, body empty. So snake coordinates: [H1]\n\nIf apple at H1, then after move, head at H1, body [H0]. So coordinates: [H1, H0]\n\nTurn 2: if no apple at H2, then after move, head at H2, body: [H1]? But since the body was [H0], and when moving, the body follows: the tail moves to where the previous body was? In snake, when moving without eating, the body shifts: the new head is at H2, and the new body is the previous head and all body except the last segment? Actually, for a snake of length L, when moving, the head moves to new cell, and each body segment moves to the position of the previous segment, and the tail moves away. So if length L, after moving without eating, length remains L, so the tail moves to the position of the second-to-last body segment.\n\nBut if length 1, after moving without eating, there is no body, so the tail is just the head? But in terms of coordinates, for length 1, after moving, only head exists, no body.\n\nFor length 2, coordinates: [head, tail] where tail is the first body segment.\n\nWhen moving, if no eating, new head at H_new, new body becomes [old head] for length 2? Let's see: snake has [H, T] where T is tail. When it moves to H_new, the new coordinates are [H_new, H] because the tail T is gone? No, that would decrease length? I think I have it wrong.\n\nIn standard snake, when you move without eating, the snake moves forward: the head moves to new cell, and the tail moves to the position of the second-to-last segment. So for a snake with body list [head, segment1, segment2, ..., tail], after moving, new list is [new_head, head, segment1, ..., segment_{n-1}] where n is length? No.\n\nActually, in many implementations, the snake is stored as a list of coordinates from head to tail. When moving, you add the new head to the front, and if no apple, you remove the last element (the tail). If apple, you add the new head but do not remove the tail, so length increases by 1.\n\nSo for example, if snake has coordinates: [H0] (length 1), and it moves to H1 without apple, then new coordinates: [H1] because you add new head and remove old tail? But old tail was H0? Since it was only one element, after moving, you have new head H1, and no body? But that means length remains 1, so yes, [H1].\n\nIf it moves to H1 with apple, then new coordinates: [H1, H0] because you add new head and keep old head as body? But in this case, you don't remove the tail, so since there was no tail? In list terms, you add new head to front, and if apple, you don't remove the last element, so from [H0], you add H1 to front, and since apple, you don't remove last, so new list: [H1, H0]. So length 2.\n\nThen if from [H1, H0], it moves to H2 without apple, then you add H2 to front, and remove last element (H0), so new list: [H2, H1]. So length remains 2.\n\nIf with apple, you add H2 to front and do not remove last, so [H2, H1, H0], length 3.\n\nSo in summary, for a snake with coordinates [C1, C2, ..., Ck] where C1 is head, Ck is tail, when moving to new head C_new:\n\n- If no apple, new coordinates: [C_new, C1, C2, ..., C_{k-1}] so you remove the tail Ck.\n\n- If apple, new coordinates: [C_new, C1, C2, ..., Ck] so you keep all and add new head.\n\nSo in my case, initially [ (3,3) ] so k=1.\n\nIf I move to a cell without apple, new coordinates: [new_head] since I remove the tail, but tail was the only one, so after removing, I have only new_head? In the list, I add new head to front, then remove the last element. So from [ (3,3) ], if I move to (3,4) without apple, I add (3,4) to front, so list becomes [ (3,4), (3,3) ], then I remove the last element, which is (3,3), so I have [ (3,4) ]. So yes, only head remains.\n\nIf I move to an apple, then from [ (3,3) ], add new head to front, so [ (3,4), (3,3) ] if to (3,4) with apple, but since apple, I don't remove the last element, so I have [ (3,4), (3,3) ], which is length 2.\n\nSo back to my decision.\n\nNow, for the apple at (1,3), it is directly left from (2,3), so if I move to (2,3) first, then on next turn, I can move left to (1,3) and eat it.\n\nSimilarly, for (2,4), if I move to (3,4) first, then left to (2,4) to eat it.\n\nBut also, from (2,3), I can move up to (2,4) to eat the apple there.\n\nSo let's see which move allows me to eat an apple sooner.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2,3), then on next turn, I can move LEFT to (1,3) to eat apple at (1,3), or UP to (2,4) to eat apple at (2,4). So I can eat an apple on the very next turn.\n\nIf I move UP to (3,4), then on next turn, I can move LEFT to (2,4) to eat apple at (2,4), so I can also eat an apple on the next turn.\n\nSo both allow me to eat an apple on turn 1.\n\nBut if I move LEFT to (2,3), I have two choices for eating an apple, whereas if I move UP to (3,4), I have only one immediate apple: (2,4). From (3,4), I cannot eat (1,3) directly; I would need to go left to (2,4) first, then from there, I can go down to (2,3) then left to (1,3), but that takes two moves after eating (2,4), so I might eat (1,3) later.\n\nBut from (2,3), I can eat (1,3) immediately or (2,4) immediately.\n\nSo from (2,3), I have more flexibility to eat apples.\n\nAlso, after eating an apple, I grow, so my body will be present, which might affect future moves. But since I'm eating early, I might have a longer body later, but that might not be a problem if I plan properly.\n\nAnother thing: the enemy snake. If I move left, I am moving towards x=2, which is still away from enemy at x=0, so no issue.\n\nBut let's consider the long-term plan. I need to collect 50 apples to win, but since the game is only 150 turns, and there are multiple apples, I need to be efficient. But for now, I should focus on getting the first apple quickly.\n\nAlso, I should avoid trapping myself. Moving left might lead me to the left edge, but since I'm at x=3, moving to x=2 still leaves x=0,1,2,3 so I have room to move right if needed.\n\nSimilarly, moving up, I have y from 0 to 9, so plenty of room.\n\nNow, another apple at (1,4) which is adjacent to both (1,3) and (2,4). So if I go to (2,3), I can eat (1,3) then go up to (1,4)? From (1,3), after eating, I have head at (1,3), body at (2,3)? Let's see: if I move to (1,3) from (2,3), and eat apple, then after move, head at (1,3), body [ (2,3) ].\n\nThen from (1,3), I can move UP to (1,4) to eat apple at (1,4)? But when I move from (1,3) to (1,4), I need to ensure that (1,4) is not blocked. From board, (1,4) has apple, so it's free except for the apple, but since I'm moving onto it, I eat it and grow.\n\nBut after moving to (1,4), my body would be [ (1,3), (2,3) ]? Since I grew, I keep the body and add new head, so yes.\n\nBut also, from (2,3), if I move UP to (2,4) first, I eat apple at (2,4), then from (2,4), I can move LEFT to (1,4) to eat another apple, or move DOWN to (2,3) etc.\n\nSo from (2,3), I have multiple paths to eat multiple apples.\n\nFrom (3,4), I can eat (2,4) then go LEFT to (1,4) to eat another apple, but I cannot eat (1,3) directly from there without going down, which might be inefficient.\n\nSo overall, moving LEFT to (2,3) seems better because it gives me access to both (1,3) and the pair (1,4) and (2,4).\n\nMoreover, from (2,3), I can also go to (1,4) directly? From (2,3) to (1,4) is not directly adjacent; I need to go left and up, so two moves, but I can go to (2,4) first or (1,3) first.\n\nBut since (1,3) is closer, I might eat that first.\n\nNow, let's consider the enemy. Suppose the enemy moves towards the apples. From (0,0), it might go UP to (0,1), then to (0,2), etc., but that would be towards x=0, and the apples are at x=1 or2, so if it goes to (0,3), it can go right to (1,3) to eat apple? But from (0,3) to (1,3) is one move, but (1,3) has apple, so if I go to (1,3) on turn 1, and the enemy also goes to (1,3) on turn 1, we would collide and both die. But is that possible?\n\nThe enemy is at (0,0). To reach (1,3) in one turn? From (0,0) to (1,3) is not possible in one move because it can only move one cell per turn. So on turn 1, enemy can only be at (1,0) or (0,1). So it cannot reach (1,3) on turn 1. Similarly, on turn 2, from (1,0), it can go to (2,0) or (1,1), from (0,1) to (0,2) or (1,1). So still far from (1,3). So for at least two turns, the enemy cannot reach the apples near me. So I have time to eat the apples safely.\n\nTherefore, I don't need to worry about the enemy for now.\n\nSo, back to my move. I think LEFT is a good choice.\n\nBut let's also consider DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (3,2), from there, I can go to (2,2) or (4,2), but no apples nearby. The apple at (7,2) is far, so I would have to move right multiple times, which might take time, and during that time, the enemy might eat other apples? But there are apples on the left, so I should go for the left apples first.\n\nSimilarly, if I move RIGHT to (4,3), no immediate apples, so I might miss the opportunity to eat the left apples quickly.\n\nSo, LEFT or UP are the best options, and between them, LEFT seems slightly better because it allows me to eat two apples more directly? From (2,3), I can eat (1,3) and then (1,4) or (2,4), but from (3,4), I can eat (2,4) and then (1,4), but not (1,3) easily.\n\nSo to eat all three left apples: (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), from (2,3), I can: eat (1,3) first, then go up to (1,4), then right to (2,4)? But from (1,4), going right to (2,4) is possible, but (2,4) is already an apple, so I can eat it. But after eating (1,3), I have body, so when I move from (1,3) to (1,4), I might have my body at (2,3), so moving to (1,4) is safe? Yes, because body is at (2,3), not in the way. Then from (1,4) to (2,4), I move right, and since (2,4) has apple, I eat it. So I can eat all three apples in three moves: first move to (2,3), then to (1,3) eat one, then to (1,4) eat one, then to (2,4) eat one? But after eating at (1,3), I have head at (1,3), body at (2,3). Then when I move to (1,4), head moves to (1,4), and since no apple? Wait, (1,4) has apple, so when I move to (1,4), I eat it, so I grow: new head at (1,4), body becomes [ (1,3), (2,3) ]? According to the rule: when moving to an apple, new head at apple, and old head added to body. So from [ (1,3) ] with body [ (2,3) ]? After eating at (1,3), I have coordinates: head at (1,3), body [ (2,3) ] so list: [ (1,3), (2,3) ].\n\nThen when I move to (1,4) with apple, new head at (1,4), and I add old head to body, so new list: [ (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) ] so length 3.\n\nThen from there, I can move to (2,4) with apple, so new head at (2,4), add old head, so [ (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) ]? But wait, when I move, I add new head to front, and since apple, I don't remove tail, so yes, I keep the body and add new head.\n\nBut in this case, after moving to (2,4), I have head at (2,4), and body [ (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) ]? But (2,3) is the tail? But (2,3) is behind, and when I move, my body should follow, but since I have apple, I grow, so the tail remains? In the coordinate list, the tail is the last element, so in [ (2,4), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3) ], the tail is (2,3), which is fine.\n\nBut now, if I move from (2,4), I can go to (1,4) but (1,4) is already occupied by my body? So I cannot go there because it would hit my own body. Similarly, I cannot go down to (2,3) because that is my tail? But when I move, the tail moves? No, when I move without eating, the tail moves away, but when I eat, the tail doesn't move.\n\nSo after eating at (2,4), I have body from (1,4) to (2,3). If I want to move to (1,4), it is occupied by my body, so I cannot move there. So I need to be careful after growing.\n\nBut in this sequence, I have eaten three apples, so I have length 4, and I might be in a position where I can move around.\n\nBut for now, at turn 0, I need to make the first move.\n\nI think moving LEFT is good.\n\nBut let's see if there is any risk in moving LEFT.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2,3), is there any chance of collision? From board, (2,3) is empty, and enemy is at (0,0), so no. Also, I'm not moving backwards since I have no body.\n\nSo safe.\n\nSimilarly for UP.\n\nBut why choose LEFT over UP? Because from (2,3), I can eat (1,3) on next turn, which is an apple, and from there, I can then move to (1,4) to eat another apple. From (3,4), I can eat (2,4) on next turn, but then to eat (1,4), I can go left, but from (2,4), going left to (1,4) is possible, but after eating at (2,4), I have body, so when I go to (1,4), it might be safe? But from (2,4), after eating, head at (2,4), body at (3,4) if I came from (3,4)? Let's see: if I move from (3,4) to (2,4) with apple, then after move, head at (2,4), body [ (3,4) ]. Then from (2,4), I can move LEFT to (1,4) with apple, so head to (1,4), body becomes [ (2,4), (3,4) ]. So I can eat two apples: (2,4) and (1,4) in two moves.\n\nBut from (2,3), I can eat (1,3) and then (1,4) or (2,4), so I can eat two apples in two moves as well.\n\nBut from (2,3), I have the option to eat (1,3) which is closer than (2,4) from (3,4)? From (3,4) to (2,4) is one move, but from (2,3) to (1,3) is one move, same distance.\n\nBut from (2,3), I can also eat (2,4) by moving up, so I have two apples within one move, whereas from (3,4), I have only one apple within one move.\n\nSo from (2,3), I have more choices for immediate apple eating.\n\nTherefore, I think LEFT is better.\n\nAnother thing: the apple at (1,3) is only accessible from left or right? From above or below? From (1,2) or (1,4) or (2,3). So if I go to (2,3), I am adjacent to (1,3), so I can eat it directly. If I go to (3,4), I am not adjacent to (1,3); I need to go to (2,4) first, then to (2,3) or (1,4), but to reach (1,3), I need to go down from (1,4) or left from (2,3), etc.\n\nSo to reach (1,3) quickly, from (2,3) is direct.\n\nSimilarly, for the cluster, (1,3) is part of it.\n\nSo I'll go LEFT.\n\nBut let's confirm the coordinates. My current head is (3,3). Moving LEFT means decreasing x by 1, so to (2,3).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the plan, I should think ahead. After moving to (2,3), on next turn, I might move LEFT to (1,3) to eat the apple there. Then from there, I might move UP to (1,4) to eat another apple. Or I might move UP to (2,4) from (2,3) if I don't eat (1,3) first.\n\nBut I need to decide on turn 0 only.\n\nSo for the response, I need to output the move.\n\nAlso, I should write a plan for future turns, which will be shown as last rationale on next turn.\n\nSo for now, my move is LEFT.\n\nBut let's see if there is any reason not to go LEFT.\n\nWhat if I go LEFT and then on next turn, the enemy happens to move to (1,3) from somewhere? But as I said, it cannot reach there in one turn. On turn 1, enemy can be at most at (1,0) or (0,1), etc., so no.\n\nAnother thing: when I move, the enemy moves simultaneously, so if I move to (2,3), and the enemy moves to (1,0) or (0,1), no issue.\n\nSo I think LEFT is safe.\n\nTherefore, I'll choose LEFT.\n\nSo my final answer is LEFT.Based on the current board state, my snake is at (3,3) with no body. I need to choose a move that allows me to safely access the nearby apples while keeping my options open for future turns. The apples at (1,3), (1,4), and (2,4) are clustered to the left and up from my position. Moving LEFT to (2,3) positions me adjacent to both the apple at (1,3) and the cluster at (1,4) and (2,4), giving me multiple immediate paths to eat apples on the next turn. This move avoids any immediate risks from the enemy snake at (0,0), which cannot reach me quickly, and maintains flexibility without trapping me against edges. Other moves like UP or DOWN offer fewer immediate apple opportunities, and RIGHT leads away from the apple cluster. Thus, LEFT is the optimal choice for turn 0.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: After moving to (2,3), prioritize eating the apple at (1,3) or (2,4) on turn 1. Then, move to consume the remaining apples in the left cluster while monitoring enemy snake movements to avoid collisions.\n\nLEFT",

This is moving backwards into my own body.\n    -   **DEADLY**.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\nUP gets me an apple immediately.\nDOWN gets me nothing and puts me at (1,2).\nLEFT gets me nothing.\n\nThe long-term plan from the previous turn said: \"On turn 1, move to (1,3) to eat the apple there. Then, move to (1,4) to eat the next apple, and subsequently to (2,4) to consume the third apple.\"\nI am now at (1,3) having eaten the first apple. The next step in the plan is to move to (1,4) to eat the next apple.\n\nThe apple at (1,4) is at (1,4). My head is at (1,3). Moving UP takes me there.\n\nLet's double check for collisions.\nSnake #1 is at (1,1). They can move UP to (1,2), DOWN to (1,0), LEFT to (0,1), or RIGHT to (2,1).\nThey cannot reach (1,4) this turn.\nThey could potentially move UP and we could collide if I moved DOWN, but I'm moving UP.\n\nIs there any risk to moving UP?\nIf I move UP to (1,4), I grow. My new body will be [(1,3), (2,3)] (wait, if I ate an apple, the tail stays, so body becomes [(1,3), (2,3)]).\nWait, if I ate an apple at (1,3) on turn 1, I grew. The body is currently [(2,3)].\nIf I move to (1,4) and eat an apple, I grow again.\nMy current head: (1,3). My body: [(2,3)].\nIf I move UP to (1,4):\nNew head: (1,4).\nNew body: Old head (1,3) + old body [(2,3)] = [(1,3), (2,3)].\nThis is valid.\n\nAre there any other snakes?\nSnake #1 at (1,1).\nPossible moves for snake #1:\n- (1,2)\n- (1,0)\n- (0,1)\n- (2,1)\n\nNone of these are (1,4). So no head-on collision.\n\nWhat about walls?\n(1,4) is within the 0-9 range. Safe.\n\nWhat about my own body?\nMy body is at (2,3) and I am at (1,3). Moving to (1,4) does not hit my body.\n\nSo UP is the best move. It eats an apple and follows the plan.\n\nOne detail: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\".\nThe apples listed are: (1,4), (2,4), (3,7), (7,2), (7,5).\nMy head is (1,3). Moving UP to (1,4) lands on an apple.\n\nI will write a rationale and then the move.\n\nRationale:\nI am currently at (1,3) with the tail at (2,3). The apples at (1,4) and (2,4) are adjacent. The apple at (1,4) is directly above my current head position. Moving UP to (1,4) allows me to consume this apple, grow, and set up a path to the apple at (2,4) or (1,5). The enemy snake is far away at (1,1) and cannot intercept me. Moving RIGHT is fatal as it moves into my own body at (2,3). Moving DOWN or LEFT is safe but moves away from the apple cluster.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat the apple at (1,4). Then move to (2,4) to eat the third apple in the cluster. After consuming the cluster at (2,4), evaluate the board for the remaining apples at (3,7), (7,2), and (7,5).\n\nMove: UP\n\nWait, I should check if I'm allowed to write the plan. The prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan... This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo I should include it.\n\nLet's verify the coordinates again.\nCurrent head: (1,3).\nTarget: (1,4).\nDelta: +Y.\n\nMy last move was LEFT. That implies I was at (2,3) and moved to (1,3).\nThe board state shows:\n`3 . 0 T . . . . . . .`\nRow 3, col 0 is `.`.\nRow 3, col 1 is `0` (My head).\nRow 3, col 2 is `T` (My tail).\nSo I am indeed at (1,3).\n\nApples at: `(1, 4), (2, 4), ...`\nSo (1,4) is an apple.\n\nEnemy snake #1: `(1, 1)`.\nDistance to (1,4) is 3 units. He cannot reach it this turn.\n\nOne check: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nMy head is (1,3). My body connects to (2,3).\n(2,3) is to the Right of (1,3).\nSo moving RIGHT is backwards.\nMoving UP, DOWN, LEFT are not backwards.\nSo RIGHT is the only direction that is instantly fatal by the \"backwards into self\" rule.\n\nDecision is UP.\n\nDouble check: The prompt says \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used... (0,0) at bottom left\".\nThis means Y increases as we go up. So UP is +Y.\n(1,3) -> (1,4) is UP.\nCorrect.\n\nFinal check on the enemy snake. It has no body. Head at (1,1).\nIf it moves UP, it goes to (1,2).\nIf I moved DOWN, I'd go to (1,2).\nIf I move UP, I go to (1,4).\nNo collision.\n\nIf it moves RIGHT, it goes to (2,1).\nNo collision.\n\nIf it moves LEFT, it goes to (0,1).\nNo collision.\n\nIf it moves DOWN, it goes to (1,0).\nNo collision.\n\nI am safe to move UP.\n\nLong-term plan looks good. Eat (1,4), then (2,4).\n\nOne minor thing. The prompt says \"Scores so far: ... Your snake (ID 0) apples: 1\".\nThis matches me eating an apple previously.\nIf I eat (1,4), I get +1.\n\nLet's write the response.\n\nRationale:\nI am at (1,3). The apple at (1,4) is directly above. Moving UP collects it. The enemy snake at (1,1) is too far to threaten this move. Moving RIGHT would hit my tail. Moving DOWN or LEFT is safe but suboptimal as it doesn't collect an apple.\n\nPlan: Collect the apple at (1,4). Then move to (2,4) to collect the next apple in the cluster.\n\nMove: UP\n\nWait, I should not mention \"Move: UP\" in the text, just have \"UP\" as the last line.\n\nStructure:\n1. Rationale text.\n2. Plan text.\n3. \"UP\"\n\nThe prompt says \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\" and \"You may also write a short long-term plan...\".\nIt seems the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" block in the prompt is what I should emulate for my *next* turn. So my output should be a text block containing reasoning and plan, ending with the word.\n\nLet's re-read the instruction: \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\n\nOkay.\n\nReasoning:\nI am at (1,3).\nTarget (1,4) is an apple.\nMoving UP is safe.\nMoving RIGHT is death (tail).\nMoving DOWN/LEFT is safe but less optimal.\n\nPlan:\nEat (1,4), then (2,4).\n\nMove: UP\n\nLet's consider if the enemy could move to (1,4) if I don't.\nEnemy is at (1,1). He is 3 steps away.\nHe would need 3 turns to get there. I can get there in 1 turn.\nSo I should definitely go get it.\n\nOne thing: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\".\nThis means my tail (2,3) will remain there for this turn.\nNext turn, if I eat, my body will be [(1,3), (2,3)].\n\nIs there any scenario where the enemy moves to a spot that traps me?\nEnemy at (1,1).\nI will be at (1,4).\nIf enemy moves to (1,2) and I move to (1,5) next turn... no, that's not a trap.\nIf I move to (1,4) now.\nNext turn, I am at (1,4). My body is at (1,3) and (2,3).\nThe enemy is at (1,1). He can move to (1,2).\nIf I move to (2,4) next turn (to eat the apple there), I am safe.\nThe only way I die is if I collide with him.\nHe is at (1,1). I am at (1,4).\nHe would need to get to (1,4) in 1 turn to head-on collide. Impossible.\nHe would need to get to (2,4) in 1 turn to collide if I go there. Impossible (he is 1 step horizontally + 3 steps vertically).\nSo UP is very safe.\n\nI will stick to the plan.\n\nOne check: \"If all snakes die on the same turn...\".\nI am safe.\nEnemy is safe (assuming he doesn't run off board or hit a wall).\nSo no draw.\n\nFinal decision: UP.\n\nThe plan should probably be concise.\n\"Plan: Eat the apple at (1,4). Then proceed to the apple at (2,4).\"\n\nWait, the prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo I should write it clearly.\n\nRationale:\nI am at (1,3). Moving UP to (1,4) eats an apple. This is the most direct path to the nearest apple. Moving RIGHT is fatal as it moves into my own tail. Moving DOWN or LEFT avoids the apple and gives the enemy more time to approach the cluster, although they are currently far away. The enemy at (1,1) cannot reach (1,4) this turn.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat the apple at (1,4) on this turn. On the next turn, move to (2,4) to eat the second apple in the cluster. After that, consider moving towards (3,7) or the bottom-right apples.\n\nUP\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Do not add anything after that word\". So \"UP\" must be the very last thing.\n\nLet's verify the coordinates one last time.\nBoard:\nRow 4: `. A A . . . . . . .` -> Apples at (1,4) and (2,4).\nRow 3: `. 0 T . . . . . . .` -> Me at (1,3), Tail at (2,3).\nSo (1,3) + UP = (1,4) = Apple.\n(1,3) + RIGHT = (2,3) = Tail (Death).\n(1,3) + LEFT = (0,3) = Safe (Wall is at -1).\n(1,3) + DOWN = (1,2) = Safe.\n\nThe apple at (1,3) is gone (it's my head '0' now, and not listed in apples).\nSo the apples remaining are (1,4), (2,4), etc.\n\nThe prompt says \"Apples at: (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 7), (7, 2), (7, 5)\".\nSo yes, (1,4) is a target.\n\nI am confident in UP.\n\nOne small edge case: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\".\nIf I move UP to (1,4), I grow.\nDoes this affect anything this turn? No, because growth happens after the move.\nDoes it affect next turn? Yes, my body will be longer.\nBut I shouldn't worry about that now.\n\nThe enemy snake #1 has 0 apples. I have 1.\nIf I eat 2 more, I have 3.\nThe enemy is at (1,1). If he moves UP, he is at (1,2).\nIf I eat (1,4) and then (2,4), I will be at (2,4).\nHe will be at (1,2) or similar.\nWe are not close.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves RIGHT to (2,1)?\nStill far.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves DOWN?\nDead end, but irrelevant.\n\nOkay, I'm good.\n\nOne final check on the board map:\n```\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . A . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . . . . . .\n 5 . . . . . . . A . .\n 4 . A A . . . . . . .\n 3 . 0 T . . . . . . .\n 2 . . . . . . . A . .\n 1 . 1 . . . . . . . .\n 0 . . . . . . . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\nMy head (0) is at (1,3).\nTail (T) is at (2,3).\nApple (A) is at (1,4).\nApple (A) is at (2,4).\nEnemy (1) is at (1,1).\n\nCoordinates are X, Y.\n(1,3) -> (1,4) is UP.\n\nThe move is UP.\n\nI will generate the response now.\n\nOne thought: The prompt mentions \"Snake #1 apples: 0\".\nIs there a possibility the enemy wants the apples too?\nYes. (1,4) and (2,4) are the closest to the enemy too.\nDistance from enemy (1,1) to (1,4): 3 steps.\nDistance from me (1,3) to (1,4): 1 step.\nI win the race easily.\n\nDistance to (2,4):\nEnemy: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) (4 steps).\nMe: (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) (2 steps, if I eat the first apple on the way).\nOr (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) (2 steps, but (2,3) is my tail, so I can't go there).\nSo (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4) is the path.\nI am safe.\n\nI will write the response.\n\nRationale:\nI am at (1,3). Moving UP to (1,4) eats an apple and is safe. The enemy is too far away to contest this. Moving RIGHT kills me. Moving DOWN or LEFT is safe but doesn't get the apple.\n\nPlan: Eat the apple at (1,4), then move to (2,4) to eat the next apple.\n\nUP\n\nWait, the prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nAnd \"Do not add anything after that word\".\nSo the line should just be \"UP\".\nAnd before that, the text.\n\nThe text should explain my reasoning.\n\nOne detail: \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\nThis confirms that Y increases upwards, so UP is +Y.\n\nI'm ready.\n\nOne check on the \"START LAST RATIONALE\" in the prompt.\nIt says \"Moving UP to (3,4) would also allow access to (2,4)\".\nWait, that was for a previous position (3,3).\nMy current position is (1,3).\nThe logic holds.\n\nDouble check the rule: \"If you move directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head), you die.\"\nMy head is (1,3). My body is (2,3).\nThe vector from head to body is (1, 0).\nSo \"backwards\" is (1, 0) (Right).\nSo moving Right is backwards.\nCorrect.\n\nI am confident.\n\nResponse structure:\n1. Reasoning text.\n2. Plan text.\n3. UP\n\nI will combine reasoning and plan into a coherent text.\n\nText:\nMy head is at (1,3). The apple at (1,4) is directly above me. Moving UP will allow me to eat this apple and grow. The enemy snake at (1,1) is too far away to reach the apple or interfere with my move this turn. Moving RIGHT would cause me to run into my own tail at (2,3), resulting in death. Moving DOWN or LEFT would be safe but would miss the opportunity to collect an apple and allow the enemy to potentially close the distance to the apple cluster.\n\nLong-term plan: Collect the apple at (1,4) now. On the next turn, move to (2,4) to collect the second apple. After securing the cluster, move towards the remaining apples at (3,7), (7,2), or (7,5).\n\nUP\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Do not mention future directions after it [the word]\".\nIt seems to refer to the final word \"UP\".\nIt says \"Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.\"\nThis likely means the line containing \"UP\" should only be \"UP\".\nAnd in the text preceding it, I should be careful.\nThe instruction \"You may also write a short long-term plan...\" suggests I *should* write the plan.\nThe warning \"Do not mention future directions after it\" probably applies to the final line \"UP\".\nSo if I write \"UP then RIGHT\", that's bad.\nBut writing a plan in the paragraph above is fine.\n\nOkay, I'll stick to my text.\n\nOne tiny check. Is there any reason NOT to take the apple?\nI have 1 apple. The game ends at 50. This is turn 2/150.\nI need to eat to win. Yes.\nIs the apple trapped? No.\nIs the move dangerous? No.\nSo I should take it.\n\nFinal check on the board state mapping.\n```\n 4 . A A . . . . . . .\n 3 . 0 T . . . . . . .\n```\nRow 3, Col 1 is '0'.\nRow 4, Col 1 is 'A'.\nSo (1,3) -> (1,4) is correct.\n\nThe response is ready.My head is at (1,3). The apple at (1,4) is directly above me. Moving UP will allow me to eat this apple and grow. The enemy snake at (1,1) is too far away to reach the apple or interfere with my move this turn. Moving RIGHT would cause me to run into my own tail at (2,3), resulting in death. Moving DOWN or LEFT would be safe but would miss the opportunity to collect an apple and allow the enemy to potentially close the distance to the apple cluster.\n\nLong-term plan: Collect the apple at (1,4) now. On the next turn, move to (2,4) to collect the second apple. After securing the cluster, move towards the remaining apples at (3,7), (7,2), or (7,5).\n\nUP",

This cell is empty (checked board state at row 6: \". . . . . . . . . .\"). No snake bodies. No walls. Safe.\n2.  **DOWN**: (1, 4). This cell contains my body (tail). Moving here is suicide.\n3.  **LEFT**: (0, 5). This cell is empty (checked board state at row 5, col 0: \". \"). Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT**: (2, 5). This cell is empty (checked board state at row 5, col 2: \". \"). Safe.\n\nLong-term strategy:\nI have 2 apples. The apples are at (2, 4), (3, 7), (7, 2), (7, 5), (0, 7).\nMy current position is (1, 5).\n- To reach (2, 4): One step Right, then one step Down.\n- To reach (0, 7): One step Left, then one step Up (twice).\n- To reach (3, 7): Can go Up to (1,6) or Right to (2,5), then navigate towards (3,7).\n\nThe enemy snake is at (2, 2) with no body. It is not an immediate threat to the apples I am looking at right now (2,4) or (0,7), unless it moves very fast towards them. However, (2, 2) is close to (2, 4) and (7, 2). I am closer to (2, 4) and (0, 7).\n\nComparing UP vs RIGHT vs LEFT:\n- **RIGHT (2, 5)**: Brings me closer to apple at (2, 4) (distance 2). Also on path to (3, 7).\n- **UP (1, 6)**: Brings me closer to apple at (0, 7) (distance 2) and (3, 7) (distance 3).\n- **LEFT (0, 5)**: Brings me closer to apple at (0, 7) (distance 2).\n\nThe apple at (2, 4) seems immediately accessible and the enemy is at (2, 2), which is below it. If I go RIGHT to (2, 5), I am vertically aligned with the apple at (2, 4) and can eat it next turn. This also puts me on the x-coordinate of the apple, opening up vertical movement.\nIf I go UP, I am moving away from the (2, 4) apple.\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving away from the (2, 4) apple.\n\nLet's prioritize the apple at (2, 4).\nMove RIGHT seems the best initial move to approach the cluster of apples on the right side ((2,4), (7,2), (7,5)).\n\nChecking safety again:\n- Right: (2,5). Empty. Safe.\n- Up: (1,6). Empty. Safe.\n- Left: (0,5). Empty. Safe.\n\nGoing RIGHT sets up a kill on (2,4) next turn. It also doesn't trap me. I will have a future move of Down to (2,4) to eat the apple, provided the enemy doesn't interfere (enemy is at (2,2), so it would have to move to (2,3) then (2,4) to get there, but I can get there in 1 turn).\n\nDecision: Move RIGHT to approach the apple at (2,4).\n\nLong-term plan: Move RIGHT to (2,5) to position for eating the apple at (2,4) on the next turn. Afterwards, pursue the apples at (7,2) or (3,7).\n\nRIGHT",

This cell is empty on the board state. No walls. Safe.\n2.  **DOWN**: (2, 4). This cell was just my previous tail position. In standard Snake rules, the tail moves *after* the head moves, so this cell is now empty. Safe. *Correction*: Wait, I ate an apple at (2, 4) on this turn (Turn 5). Therefore, I do *not* remove my tail segment this turn. My body will remain [(2, 4), (2, 5)]. So moving DOWN to (2, 4) would be hitting my own body. Unsafe.\n3.  **LEFT**: (1, 5). This cell was my previous head position. It is now empty (since my body shifted). Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT**: (3, 5). This cell is empty. Safe.\n\nStrategy:\n- I am currently at (2, 5).\n- Apple at (2, 4) was eaten.\n- Nearby apples: (3, 7), (7, 2), (7, 5).\n- Enemy at (2, 3).\n- Apple at (3, 7) is a target. Distance from (2, 5) is 2 units (1 Up, 1 Right).\n- Apple at (7, 2) is a target. Distance is 6 units.\n\nAnalyzing moves:\n- **UP (2, 6)**: Moves towards (3, 7) (distance becomes 2). Leaves options to go Left, Right, or Up. Good central positioning. Safe.\n- **RIGHT (3, 5)**: Moves towards (3, 7) (distance becomes 2). Aligns with x=3. Also moves towards (7, 2). Safe.\n- **LEFT (1, 5)**: Moves away from most apples. Less optimal.\n\nComparing UP vs RIGHT:\n- Going UP keeps me on the column with the apple I just ate (and potential trap if I stay too long?), but actually, (2, 6) is open. It allows me to go to (3, 7) via (2, 7) or (3, 6).\n- Going RIGHT to (3, 5) gets me closer to (7, 2) and (7, 5).

It will likely hunt apples at (2, 4) (which is gone) or (7, 2). I am safe.\n\nLet's move towards the cluster of apples on the right side to maximize score potential. The path (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (4,5)... is open and leads towards (7,2) and (7,5).\n\nDecision: Move RIGHT.\n\nLong-term plan: Move RIGHT to (3, 5) to approach the apple at (7, 2) and (7, 5).

Bounds are 0-9.\n\n**Immediate Safety Check:**\nI am at (3, 5). I need to check where my body *will be* if I make a move, considering the tail movement rules.\n*   **Current Body:** Head (3, 5) -> Body (2, 5) -> Body (1, 5).\n*   **Turn History:** On Turn 5, I moved from (2, 5) to (3, 5). I ate an apple at (2, 4) on Turn 5. This means I did *not* shrink on Turn 5. My body length is effectively maintained.\n*   **Next Move Consequence:** If I move, my new head position becomes the first element of the body list. The previous head (3, 5) becomes the neck. The previous neck (2, 5) becomes the body. The tail (1, 5) will be removed *unless* I eat an apple on this turn (Turn 6).\n\nLet's evaluate moves:\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 6):**\n    *   **Target:** (3, 7) is an apple (2 cells away).\n    *   **Safety:** Empty. Not out of bounds.\n    *   **Path Analysis:** Moving to (3, 6) is a \"choke point\" between my body and the wall at x=3, y=0..9. However, I can immediately move Left (to 2,6) or Right (to 4,6) next turn. It is safe.\n    *   **Enemy:** Enemy is at (3, 3). Moving Up creates vertical distance.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 4):**\n    *   **Target:** (2, 4) is an apple (1 cell Left).\n    *   **Safety:** Empty.\n    *   **Path Analysis:** Moves me closer to the enemy at (3, 3). Closing distance to the enemy is risky because they might move Up, causing a head-on collision if I am at (3, 4) and they move to (3, 4).\n    *   **Warning:** The enemy is at (3, 3). If they move UP, they will be at (3, 4). If I move DOWN, I will be at (3, 4). This is a potential head-on collision. Since I cannot predict their move, I should avoid this square.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 5):**\n    *   **Target:** (2, 4) is an apple (1 cell Down). (0, 7) is an apple (distance 3).\n    *   **Safety:** (2, 5) was my head on Turn 5. Since I moved to (3, 5) and did not eat an apple on Turn 6 (the apple was eaten on Turn 5), my tail *did* move. My body on the board state shows I moved from (2, 5) to (3, 5). The cell (2, 5) is now occupied by my body (it is the neck). **Wait:** The board state shows \"5 . T T 0...\" The 'T' at (2,5) means it is occupied by my tail. If I try to move Left to (2, 5), I am moving into my own body segment. This causes death. **Correction:** Let's re-read the board carefully.\n        *   Row 5: `T T 0 .`\n        *   (1,5) is 'T'\n        *   (2,5) is 'T'\n        *   (3,5) is '0'\n        *   This means my body is currently at (2,5) and (1,5). If I move LEFT from (3,5), I go to (2,5), which is occupied by my body. **DEADLY.**\n    *   **Conclusion:** Cannot move LEFT.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 5):**\n    *   **Target:** (7, 2) and (7, 5) are apples.\n    *   **Safety:** Empty.\n    *   **Path Analysis:** Moves towards the right side apples. Keeps open space.\n    *   **Enemy:** Increases distance from enemy at (3, 3).\n\n**Decision:**\n- Eliminate **LEFT** (hits self).\n- Eliminate **DOWN** (high risk of head-on collision with Enemy at (3, 3)).\n- Compare **UP** and **RIGHT**:\n    - **UP (3, 6)** heads towards (3, 7). It puts me against the \"wall\" at x=3, but x=3 is not a wall, it's a column. The board is open. (3, 6) is safe.\n    - **RIGHT (4, 5)** heads towards (7, 2) and (7, 5). It moves me to the center of the board (x=4).\n\nBoth are safe. However, moving **RIGHT** puts me in a less congested area relative to the enemy (who is at x=3). Moving UP keeps me on the same column as the enemy. If the enemy moves UP, it might chase me. Moving RIGHT expands my territory. Also, the apple at (3, 7) is on the edge (x=3), while (7, 2) and (7, 5) are on the other edge. Moving RIGHT starts the journey to the right side cluster.\n\n**Strategy:**\nMove RIGHT to (4, 5). This avoids the immediate danger of the enemy at (3, 3) and opens up the path to the apples on the right side of the board (x=7).\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #1 is at (1, 4) with body at (2, 4).\n\nLet's evaluate possible moves:\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 6):**\n    *   **Safety:** (6, 6) is currently empty (`. `). No collision with self.\n    *   **Strategic:** Moves me closer to the apple at (7, 5). Keeps me out of the way of the enemy snake. Increases y-coordinate, moving towards the top edge, which generally is safer than bottom edges this turn. Offers potential moves to (7, 6) or (6, 7) next turn.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 4):**\n    *   **Safety:** (6, 4) is empty.\n    *   **Strategic:** Moves towards the apple at (7, 2). However, moving down brings me closer to the row where the enemy snake is (y=4). If the enemy snake moves right from (1, 4), it will still be far, but it's a busier area. Also, my tail will vacate (5, 5), opening up that space.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** This cell contains my body segment `T`. Moving here results in immediate death.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** (7, 5) contains an apple `A`. This is a safe move (apples are consumed, so the cell becomes the head, and the tail moves forward, so no self-collision).\n    *   **Strategic:** This grabs an apple immediately (+1 point). It places my head at (7, 5), which is a good position relative to the other apples on the right side ((7, 2) and (3, 7)). After this move, my body will be [(6, 5), (5, 5)], and the tail at (4, 5) moves to (5, 5), so (4, 5) becomes empty. I will have good space to the right at (8, 5) or up at (7, 6).\n\n**Comparison:**\n*   Moving **RIGHT** guarantees an apple gain immediately. In multi-apple games, scoring points is crucial for the win condition. It also moves me into a corner but provides immediate value.\n*   Moving **UP** or **DOWN** keeps options open but doesn't guarantee a point this turn.\n\nGiven the immediate availability of an apple and the need to compete for the highest score, grabbing the apple at (7, 5) is the highest value move provided it is safe. It is safe because it is an apple cell, not a snake body.\n\nPlan: Eat the apple at (7, 5). After eating, position myself to target the cluster of apples at (0, 6), (0, 7), and (3, 7) in the upper-left, or the apple at (7, 2) if the path is clear. Avoid the enemy snake at (1, 4).\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Based on the last move information provided, my previous head was at `(6, 5)` and I moved `RIGHT` to `(7, 5)`. In standard Snake game logic, the head moves into the destination cell, the body follows (so the segment at `(6, 5)` moves to `(7, 5)`, and so on), and the tail vacates its previous spot. However, looking at the provided \"Board state\" (which is supposedly current), the head is still listed as `(7, 5)` and the body as `[(6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5)]`. This implies the turn has not yet fully resolved in the input data, or the representation is strictly \"Head + Body list\". \n\nRegardless, I must output a move for the **current** state.\n\n**Analysis of the \"Current\" Board State:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head: `(7, 5)`\n    *   Body: `[(6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5)]` (Occupying coordinates `(6,5)` through `(4,5)`).\n*   **Apples:** `(7, 2)`, `(0, 7)`, `(0, 6)`, `(3, 5)`. (The apple at `(7, 5)` seems to be gone from the board representation in the text, or I am effectively on it).\n*   **Enemy (Snake #1):**\n    *   Head: `(1, 5)`\n    *   Body: `[(1, 4)]`\n\n**Move Evaluation from Head `(7, 5)`:**\n\n1.  **RIGHT:** Move to `(8, 5)`.\n    *   **Safety:** `(8, 5)` is empty (`.`).\n    *   **Body:** My body is to the left. This is safe.\n    *   **Strategic:** Continues movement to the right. Good space available.\n\n2.  **LEFT:** Move to `(6, 5)`.\n    *   **Safety:** This coordinate is occupied by my own body (the first segment of the body list).\n    *   **Result:** Death.\n\n3.  **UP:** Move to `(7, 6)`.\n    *   **Safety:** `(7, 6)` is empty (`.`).\n    *   **Body:** My body is South (down). This is safe.\n    *   **Strategic:** Moves towards the top right corner. Keeps options open.\n\n4.  **DOWN:** Move to `(7, 4)`.\n    *   **Safety:** `(7, 4)` is empty (`.`).\n    *   **Body:** My body is North (up). This is safe.\n    *   **Strategic:** Moves towards the apple at `(7, 2)`.\n\n**Decision:**\nBoth **UP**, **DOWN**, and **RIGHT** are safe. \n*   **RIGHT** is likely the best move because I am at `(7, 5)` (which is on the right edge at `x=7`, so `x=9` is the boundary). Moving right gives me more space and keeps me in the horizontal position I was in during the previous turn rationale, which was considered stable. \n*   **UP** is also strong, moving towards the top edge and `(3, 7)` eventually. \n*   **DOWN** leads towards `(7, 2)`, but brings me closer to the enemy snake's potential movement range (they are at `y=5`).\n\nLet's stick to the previous plan's intent or simply expand space. Moving **RIGHT** to `(8, 5)` maximizes immediate board space usage and keeps me parallel to the apple at `(7, 2)` (which would be at `(7, 4)` relative to my head if I move right? No, `(7, 2)` is two units down from `(7, 4)`).\n\nActually, looking at the board again: I am at `x=7`. `x=9` is the limit. Moving **RIGHT** gets me closer to the right wall, but gives me a turn to maneuver. **UP** moves me away from the potential collision zone with the enemy and towards the apple at `(3, 7)`. \n\nHowever, if I am at `(7, 5)`, the cell `(8, 5)` is right there and empty. Let's keep the momentum or just pick the safest one that opens the most avenues. Moving **RIGHT** is a solid choice as I am not near a wall yet (`x=7` vs `x=9`).\n\nWait, let's double check the coordinates.\n`(7, 5)` is at x=7.\n`(8, 5)` is right.\n`(7, 6)` is up.\n`(7, 4)` is down.\n`(6, 5)` is left (Into body).\n\n**RIGHT** seems fine. The previous rationale suggested moving right to eat an apple, but if the board state implies I'm already there (or just moved there), moving right again continues that safe vector.\n\nLet's try to be safe. I will choose **RIGHT**.\n\n**Alternative consideration:**\nIf I am at `(7, 5)` and I want to eventually get the apples at `(0, 6)` and `(0, 7)` (top left), I need to start moving generally UP or LEFT. Moving RIGHT seems counter-intuitive for that goal. However, the immediate safety is paramount. The top left is far away. Moving UP to `(7, 6)` avoids the bottom of the board and keeps me generally pointed in a safer direction.\n\nLet's verify `UP`.\n`(7, 6)` is `.`.\nMy body is at `(6, 5)` (Down-Left relative to head? No, if head is at `(7,5)`, body is at `(6,5)`, which is LEFT). So `(7, 6)` is clear of my body.\nEnemy is far away.\nUP is very safe.\nUP is actually closer to the apple at `(3, 7)` (via `x=3`).\nUP is also safer than DOWN because DOWN heads towards row 4, where the enemy snake (if it moves) could be.\n\nActually, looking at the previous turn's rationale, I moved from `(6,5)` to `(7,5)`. That was a RIGHT move.\nIf I continue **RIGHT** to `(8,5)`, I am moving into the right side.\nIf I move **UP** to `(7,6)`, I am clearing the horizontal line.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\n`9 . . . . . . . . . .`\n`7 A . . A . . . . . .`\n`5 . 1 . A T T T 0 . .`\n`4 . T . . . . . . . .`\n\nMy head `0` is at `(7,5)`.\nThe cell `(7,4)` is empty. `(7,6)` is empty. `(8,5)` is empty.\nThe enemy `1` is at `(1,5)`.\n\nGiven I have 3 apples and the game goes to 150 turns (turn 10 now), I am in the early/mid game. I should prioritize survival and positioning.\nMoving **UP** to `(7, 6)` moves me towards the top-left apples ((3,7), (0,7), (0,6)) and away from the bottom edge. The bottom edge is risky because if you get trapped there, you have fewer moves.\nMoving **RIGHT** to `(8, 5)` moves me towards the right edge, limiting my future options on the right side.\nTherefore, **UP** is the better strategic move for long-term positioning, while still being safe.\n\nLet's re-verify: From `(7,5)`, moving UP to `(7,6)`.\nIs it safe? Yes.\nIs it useful? Yes, gets me closer to the top and left apples.\n\nWait, I should consider if I can eat an apple immediately.\nThe apples are at `(3,7), (7,2), (0,7), (0,6), (3,5)`.\nNone are adjacent to `(7,5)` except maybe `(7,2)` is 3 steps down, or `(3,5)` is 4 steps left.\nSo no immediate apple gain this turn.\nThus, positioning is key.\n\n**UP** seems best.\n\nWait, let me check the prompt's \"Coordinates range\".\n`(0,0)` is bottom left.\n`(9,9)` is top right.\nSo `y` increases UP.\nYes, **UP** increases y.\n\nSo, **UP** is a valid, safe, and strategic move.\n\nLet's double check `RIGHT`.\nIf I go **RIGHT** to `(8,5)`.\nBoard size is 10x10 (indices 0-9).\n`(8,5)` is fine.\nNext turn I could go to `(9,5)`.\nIf I go to `(9,5)`, I am at `x=9` (Right edge).\nFrom `(9,5)`, I can only go LEFT, UP, or DOWN.\nIf I go UP to `(9,6)`, I can't go RIGHT.\nIf I go UP to `(9,6)` then UP to `(9,7)`, etc.\nGetting stuck on the right wall limits maneuvering.\nThe top-left corner is actually the opposite corner.\nMoving **UP** starts the long journey across the board to eat the cluster at `(0,6), (0,7), (3,7)`.\n\nSo, **UP** is the move.\n\nFinal check on safety:\nCurrent Head: `(7,5)`.\nMove UP: `(7,6)`.\nBody: `[(6,5), (5,5), (4,5)]`.\n`(7,6)` is not `(6,5)` (my closest body part). It is `(7,6)` vs `(6,5)`.\nDistance is 1 in x and 1 in y. Not adjacent in a way that causes collision.\nWait, collision is only if the head lands ON the body segment.\nSo `(7,6)` is safe.\nEnemy: `(1,5)`. Safe.\n\nOkay, I will go UP.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove UP to `(7,6)` to position myself towards the top of the board, away from the bottom edge and the enemy. From there, I will navigate leftwards to target the cluster of apples in the top-left quadrant ((3,7), (0,7), (0,6)). Avoiding the enemy at `(1,4)/(1,5)` is a priority.\n\nUP",

If I was at `(5,6)` and moved `LEFT`, I would be at `(4,6)`. If I was at `(7,6)` (image state) and moved `LEFT`, I would be at `(6,6)`. The board image is the most consistent ground truth for the current state, showing a head at `(7,6)`).\n    *   My Body list in the prompt `[(6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5)]` implies the tail is at `(7,5)` and the head is at `(6,6)`. Wait, let's re-read the prompt \"Head: (5,6), Body: [(6,6), (7,6), (7,5)]\". This implies the snake connects: (5,6) -> (6,6) -> (7,6) -> (7,5). This is a \"snake\" connecting these points.\n    *   However, the board image shows:\n        Row 6: `A T . . . 0 T T . .`\n        Row 5: `. A . A . . . T . .`\n        This corresponds to:\n        `(0,6)`, `(1,6)`, `(5,6)`, `(6,6)`, `(7,6)`? No, the image shows `0` at `(5,6)`?\n        Let's look at the coordinates in the image grid provided:\n        Row 6 (Y=6): `A T . . . 0 T T . .`\n        Cols: 0      1  2  3 4 5  6  7  8  9\n        This means at `(5,6)` there is `0`.\n        At `(6,6)` there is `T`.\n        At `(7,6)` there is `T`.\n        So my head is at `(5,6)`? But the prompt says \"Head: (5,6)\" and my last move was LEFT. If I moved LEFT from `(5,6)`, I am now at `(4,6)`.\n        But the image provided is *after* the move? Or is it the state *before* the move?\n        The prompt says: \"Turn: 13 / 150... Board state:\"\n        Usually, the board state is the *current* state before we choose our next move.\n        If the board shows `0` at `(5,6)`, then my head is currently at `(5,6)`.\n        Wait, the board says: `5 . A . A . . . T . .` (Y=5) and `6 A T . . . 0 T T . .` (Y=6).\n        Let's look at `(7,6)`: It is `T` (Tail). `(6,6)` is `T`. `(5,6)` is `0` (Head).\n        So, my head is at `(5,6)`.\n        My body is at `(6,6)` and `(7,6)`? And where is the rest? The prompt Body list is `[(6, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5)]`.\n        This matches the board: `(6,6)` and `(7,6)` are visible. `(7,5)` is in the row below (Row 5, Col 7 is `T`).\n        So, Head: `(5,6)`. Body: `(6,6)`, `(7,6)`, `(7,5)`.\n        Okay, the board image matches the prompt body list, but the image shows the `0` at `(5,6)`.\n        My last move was `LEFT`. That means I moved from `(6,6)` to `(5,6)`. This is consistent.\n\n2.  **Apples:**\n    *   `(3, 7)`: Visible in image (Row 7, Col 3).\n    *   `(7, 2)`: Visible in image (Row 2, Col 7).\n    *   `(0, 6)`: Visible in image (Row 6, Col 0).\n    *   `(3, 5)`: Visible in image (Row 5, Col 3).\n    *   `(1, 5)`: Visible in image (Row 5, Col 1).\n    *   Prompt says `(0, 6), (3, 5), (1, 5)` and also `(3, 7), (7, 2)`. Wait, the prompt list includes `(0, 6)` twice? No: `(3, 7), (7, 2), (0, 6), (3, 5), (1, 5)`. Correct.\n\n3.  **Enemy:**\n    *   Snake #1: Head `(0, 7)`, Body `[(1, 7), (1, 6)]`.\n    *   Image confirms: `(0, 7)` has `1`. `(1, 7)` has `T`. `(1, 6)` has `T`.\n    *   Snake #1 is far away on the left.\n\n4.  **Moves from Head `(5,6)`:**\n    *   **UP:** To `(5, 7)`. Image Row 7, Col 5 is `.` (Empty). Safe.\n    *   **DOWN:** To `(5, 5)`. Image Row 5, Col 5 is `.` (Empty). Safe.\n    *   **LEFT:** To `(4, 6)`. Image Row 6, Col 4 is `.` (Empty). Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT:** To `(6, 6)`. Image Row 6, Col 6 is `T` (My own body). **Lethal**.\n\n5.  **Strategic Evaluation:**\n    *   **Current Status:** I am at `(5,6)`.\n    *   **Right:** Blocked by my own body at `(6,6)`. Cannot move there.\n    *   **Up (`(5,7)`):** Leaves me at `Y=7`, which is close to the top wall (`Y=9`). Reduces maneuverability upwards.\n    *   **Down (`(5,5)`):** Moves me towards the cluster of apples at `(1,5), (3,5)` and away from the top wall.\n    *   **Left (`(4,6)`):** Moves me towards apples at `(0,6)` and `(3,5)`. Moves me away from the right wall.\n    *   **Comparison:** `UP` is restricted by the wall. `DOWN` and `LEFT` open up the board. `RIGHT` is suicide.\n    *   **Safety:** Enemy Snake #1 is at `(0,7)`. Its potential moves: Right to `(1,7)` (Body), Down to `(0,6)` (Apple), Up to `(0,8)`, Left (Wall). If it moves Down to `(0,6)`, it eats an apple. It is unlikely to be near me immediately unless it goes way right, but currently it is stuck near the left wall.\n    *   `DOWN` vs `LEFT`:\n        *   `DOWN` to `(5,5)`: Moves me to row 5. Apples at `(3,5)` and `(1,5)` are on this row. Good for horizontal movement.\n        *   `LEFT` to `(4,6)`: Moves me to row 6. Apple at `(0,6)` is on this row. Also good.\n        *   Looking at the board, Row 5 has apples at `1` and `3`. Row 6 has an apple at `0`.\n        *   If I go `DOWN` to `(5,5)`, I am on the same row as the `(3,5)` apple. I can then go `LEFT` to `(4,5)`, `(3,5)` (Eat).\n        *   If I go `LEFT` to `(4,6)`, I am on the same row as `(0,6)`. I can go `LEFT` to `(3,6)`, `(2,6)`... wait, I need to check obstacles.\n        *   Let's look at the path to the `(3,5)` apple (worth 1 point, 2 moves away).\n        *   Path 1 (Down then Left): `(5,6)` -> `(5,5)` -> `(4,5)` -> `(3,5)`.\n        *   Path 2 (Left then Down): `(5,6)` -> `(4,6)` -> `(4,5)` -> `(3,5)`.\n        *   Both paths seem valid.\n        *   Let's look at the path to `(1,5)` apple (worth 1 point).\n        *   `(5,6)` -> `(5,5)` -> `(4,5)` -> `(3,5)` (Eat) -> `(2,5)` -> `(1,5)` (Eat).\n        *   This is a clear line of sight for 2 apples.\n        *   What about `(0,6)`?\n        *   `(5,6)` -> `(4,6)` -> `(3,6)` -> `(2,6)` -> `(1,6)`. Wait, `(1,6)` is Snake #1's body (Tail). I cannot go there.\n        *   So to get to `(0,6)`, I would have to go around. Or go `(5,6)` -> `(4,6)` -> `(4,5)` -> `(3,5)` -> `(2,5)` -> `(1,5)` -> `(0,5)` -> `(0,6)`. That's a long detour.\n        *   The apples at `(3,5)` and `(1,5)` are much closer and accessible if I go `DOWN` or `LEFT` then `DOWN`.\n        *   `DOWN` seems slightly better because it puts me immediately on the row with the apples `3,5` and `1,5`.\n        *   `LEFT` puts me on the row with `0,6` (blocked by snake #1 body).\n        *   However, `LEFT` moves me away from the right wall and keeps my options open.\n        *   Let's re-evaluate `DOWN`. `(5,5)` is safe. The space around `(5,5)` is open.\n        *   Let's re-evaluate `LEFT`. `(4,6)` is safe.\n        *   Let's re-evaluate `UP`. `(5,7)` is safe. But I'm getting closer to the top wall `(9,9)`. I have 140 turns left. I don't want to be near a wall unless necessary.\n        *   So `UP` is the worst option.\n        *   `DOWN` puts me at `Y=5`. `LEFT` puts me at `Y=6`.\n        *   The apples at `(3,5)` and `(1,5)` are on `Y=5`.\n        *   The apple at `(3,7)` is on `Y=7`. I could go `UP` to chase it, but that wall is dangerous.\n        *   Let's check the `DOWN` path to `(3,5)` and `(1,5)`. `(5,6) -> (5,5) -> (4,5) -> (3,5)` (Eat). From `(3,5)`, I am at `X=3`. `(1,5)` is at `X=1`. I can continue `LEFT` to `(2,5)` then `(1,5)` (Eat).\n        *   This path is completely open (all `.` in image).\n        *   This seems like a very good plan. It secures 2 apples quickly.\n        *   Let's check `LEFT` path. `(5,6) -> (4,6) -> (4,5) -> (3,5)`. Also works.\n        *   Why choose one over the other?\n        *   `DOWN` moves me onto the target row immediately.\n        *   `LEFT` moves me closer to the left wall, but `X=4` is still far enough.\n        *   Actually, let's look at the board again.\n        *   Row 5: `. A . A . . . T . .`\n        *   Apples at `(1,5)` and `(3,5)`.\n        *   If I move `DOWN` to `(5,5)`, I am at `(5,5)`. I have apples at `X=3` and `X=1`.\n        *   If I move `LEFT` to `(4,6)`, I am at `(4,6)`. I have an apple at `(0,6)`.\n        *   However, `(1,6)` is blocked by Snake #1's tail.\n        *   To get to `(0,6)` from `(4,6)`, I have to go `(4,6)->(4,5)->(3,5)->(2,5)->(1,5)->(0,5)->(0,6)`. This path takes me past the apples at `3,5` and `1,5` anyway.\n        *   So the goal is to eat `(3,5)` and `(1,5)`.\n        *   Is there any risk?\n        *   Snake #1 is at `(0,7)`. It might move `DOWN` to `(0,6)`. It might move `RIGHT` to `(1,7)` (blocked by its body).\n        *   If Snake #1 moves `DOWN` to `(0,6)`, it eats the apple there.\n        *   It is unlikely to threaten me in the near future.\n        *   So the safest and most productive move is to head towards the cluster of apples on row 5.\n        *   `DOWN` to `(5,5)` seems direct.\n        *   `LEFT` to `(4,6)` also works, but `DOWN` gets me closer to the apples faster.\n        *   Wait, let's look at `LEFT` again. `(4,6)`. From there I can go `DOWN` to `(4,5)`.\n        *   Let's compare `DOWN` (to 5,5) vs `LEFT` (to 4,6).\n        *   `DOWN`: Moves to `(5,5)`. Next moves: `LEFT` to `(4,5)` (Apple at 3,5 is next). `UP` to `(5,6)` (Safe, but loops). `DOWN` to `(5,4)`. `RIGHT` to `(6,5)`.\n        *   `LEFT`: Moves to `(4,6)`. Next moves: `DOWN` to `(4,5)`. `LEFT` to `(3,6)`. `UP` to `(4,7)`.\n        *   Both `DOWN` and `LEFT` lead to `(4,5)` as a subsequent step to get to `(3,5)`.\n        *   Why `DOWN`?\n        *   `DOWN` puts me at `(5,5)`. If I go `LEFT` from there, I hit `(4,5)`. If I go `LEFT` from `(5,6)`, I hit `(4,6)`.\n        *   At `(5,5)`, the apple at `(3,5)` is distance 2. At `(4,6)`, the apple at `(3,5)` is distance 2.\n        *   Is there any reason to prefer one?\n        *   At `(5,5)`, I am closer to the right side (x=5 vs x=4). This keeps options open if I need to run away later? No, the apples are left.\n        *   At `(4,6)`, I am on the row of the isolated apple `(0,6)`.\n        *   Let's consider the \"future options\".\n        *   `DOWN` to `(5,5)`:\n            *   I am on the row of the two apples.\n            *   I can go `LEFT` to eat them.\n            *   If I need to escape, I can go `DOWN` or `UP` or `RIGHT`.\n        *   `LEFT` to `(4,6)`:\n            *   I am on the row of the top apple.\n            *   I am one step closer to the left wall (x=4).\n            *   I am further from the right wall (x=9).\n            *   Usually, staying central is better. `(5,5)` is more central than `(4,6)`? Not really.\n        *   Let's look at the `RIGHT` move again. It's `(6,6)`. That's my body.\n        *   Let's look at `UP`. `(5,7)`. Apples at `(3,7)`. Distance 2. But I'm at y=7. Top wall is y=9. If I go `UP`, I'm at `Y=7`. If I go `UP` again, `Y=8`. If I go `UP` again, `Y=9` (Wall).\n        *   Going `UP` is a trap.\n        *   So, `UP` is out.\n        *   `RIGHT` is out.\n        *   `DOWN` vs `LEFT`.\n        *   `DOWN` to `(5,5)` puts me on the X-axis of the `(3,5)` apple. I can simply walk left to `(4,5)`, `(3,5)`.\n        *   `LEFT` to `(4,6)` puts me on the X-axis `4`.\n        *   Let's check `(4,5)`. Is it safe? Image shows `.`.\n        *   Is there any risk of head-on collision?\n        *   Snake #1 is at `(0,7)`.\n        *   If Snake #1 moves `RIGHT`, it hits its body.\n        *   If Snake #1 moves `DOWN`, it goes to `(0,6)`.\n        *   If Snake #1 moves `UP`, it goes to `(0,8)`.\n        *   It is very far away.\n        *   So the choice is between `DOWN` and `LEFT`.\n        *   `DOWN` is better because it moves me directly towards the cluster of 2 apples `(3,5)` and `(1,5)` located on row 5.\n        *   `LEFT` moves me towards `(0,6)` (blocked by enemy body) and `(3,5)` (requires a turn down).\n        *   I will move `DOWN`.\n\n    *   **Decision:** `DOWN`. Moves to `(5,5)`. This is safe. It moves me towards apples `(3,5)` and `(1,5)`. It avoids walls and immediate danger.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Continue moving left towards the apples at (3,5) and (1,5). Eat them to grow. Avoid the top wall.\n\nDOWN",

Safe.\n\n3.  **Safety and Strategy:**\n    *   Immediate danger: Moving `DOWN` or `LEFT` results in death by self-collision.\n    *   Remaining options: `UP` and `RIGHT`.\n    *   **Analysis of `UP`:**\n        *   Moves to `(7, 7)`.\n        *   Keeps me on the line `X=7`.\n        *   There is an apple at `(7, 2)` directly below me. Moving `UP` moves me further away from it.\n        *   There is an apple at `(3, 7)` on the same Y-level (`Y=7`). However, the path requires moving left through `(6,7)`, `(5,7)`, etc.\n    *   **Analysis of `RIGHT`:**\n        *   Moves to `(8, 6)`.\n        *   Moves me towards the right wall (`X=9`).\n        *   The apple at `(7, 2)` is located at `(7, 2)`. To reach it, I need to be at `X=7`.\n        *   Moving `RIGHT` to `X=8` is the opposite direction of the `X=7` apple.\n        *   However, `X=9` is the wall. Moving to `X=8` leaves only one free cell (`X=9`) before the wall. This restricts future movement significantly.\n    *   **Comparison:**\n        *   `UP` to `(7, 7)` keeps me on the `X=7` line, which contains the apple at `(7, 2)` below me. Although moving up is away from the apple at `(7, 2)`, it does not commit me to a corner like `RIGHT` does. `RIGHT` locks me into a narrow vertical strip on the far right side of the board.\n        *   `UP` is the only move that preserves access to the central board and the vertical strip containing the `(7, 2)` apple without immediately restricting my movement to a single open cell.\n        *   Neither `UP` nor `RIGHT` gets me closer to the `(7, 2)` apple immediately, but `UP` avoids the wall trap.\n        *   From `(7, 7)`, I can potentially go LEFT towards `(3, 7)` or loop back DOWN later towards `(7, 2)`.\n        *   From `(8, 6)`, I have essentially 2 options: `UP` or `DOWN` (unless I eat an apple to grow).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** `UP` is the safer move because it avoids trapping myself against the right wall. It maintains the possibility of moving down towards the `(7, 2)` apple in future turns or moving left towards other apples. `RIGHT` is a trap.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Avoid the right wall. Plan to descend towards the `(7, 2)` apple once positioned to do so safely, or explore leftwards if an opportunity arises.\n\nUP",
