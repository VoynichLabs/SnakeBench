Enemy snake is at (3,2) with a short body, several apples remain, and I have a length advantage.\n\nSafe moves from (7,1):\n- RIGHT: To (8,1), landing on an apple for growth and a point; this spot is empty otherwise, no immediate collision risk (enemy is far to the left at y=2).\n- UP: To (7,2); board shows this as empty, opens paths north but delays apple eating.\n- DOWN: To (7,0); open space, but goes south into a potential dead-end area far from apples.\n- LEFT: Into my own body at (6,1); suicide, invalid.\n\nAmong safe moves, RIGHT best: Directly collects (8,1), boosting score to 6 apples and growing to 7 segments total (keeps my snake avantajous). This sets up a strong position at x=8 for climbing upward toward (8,6) and (8,7) next turn, with follow-up options like LEFT back if needed. Enemy at (3,2) poses no current threat here\u2014they'd need multiple moves to intersect\u2014and opening toward them (DOWN) wastes the turn on an distant apple pocket near y=0, letting enemy possibly advance uncontested. UP skips the apple without clear gain, as (7,2) leads to open but less strategic space. Keeping multiple exits avoids traps; prioritizing apple grab increases win chance vastly over open-space wandering.\n\nLong-term plan: Immediately eat (8,1) this move, then climb x=8 column toward (8,6) and (8,7) for two more quick apples (grow to 9 segments). Afterward, bend left at y=7 toward (1,7) via x=7 or x=6, watching enemy who may loop right from x=3. Avoid descending below y=2 unless apples demand it; maintain y coordinating to box them out if they chase. If enemy dies or stagnates, pivot to (4,8).\n\nRIGHT",

From (7,4), safe moves are only LEFT to (6,4) or DOWN to (7,3)\u2014UP is into the neck (7,5), RIGHT into body (8,4). Going LEFT would detour north toward the x=6 apple at (6,7), but that might let the enemy scoop the bottom ones first or force me into tighter spaces around their path later. DOWN keeps the direct downward flexibility, aiming for (7,1) in two more moves, then LEFT to eat (3,1) shortly after. It maintains multiple future options (can then swing UP if needed for topside apples like (9,7)) and avoids any immediate collision risks, as the enemy is far.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN**  \nContinue DOWN to (7,3), then (7,2), aiming for (7,1). Once there (turn ~28), prioritize LEFT toward (3,1) for quick eat and growth, then (2,1). If enemy shifts DOWN early (e.g., toward y=1 spot), pivot to RIGHT/UP to (9,7) via open upper space, focusing on scoring ahead with 9 apples already. Monitor for enemy diversions but stay aggressive on bottom cluster to pull ahead.\n\nDOWN",

DOWN advances my planned path toward the unguarded bottom apples at (3,1) and (2,1), keeping me positioned for lateral movement at y=1 while staying clear of the enemy snake's left-side positioning and my own body. LEFT or RIGHT could be safer in terms of keeping more follow-up options open, but they delay progress on the short-term apple harvesting plan (which has multiple safe turns ahead if the enemy doesn't aggressively disrupt the bottom row) and expose me to potential rerouting needs if the enemy pushes closer to mid-board apples like (6,7) or (3,5). Prioritizing DOWN avoids tight spaces, gets me closer to two reachable apples (4-5 LEFT moves at y=1 would get to (3,1), then further to (2,1)), and doesn't risk head-on collisions this turn since the enemy at (0,6) would likely focus on their own downward path or the apples they might threaten. Among safe moves, DOWN best balances safety, apple proximity, and future flexibility, assuming the enemy elects a likely DOWN move to (0,5) without attempting a head-on across the board.\n\n**SHORT-TERM PLAN**  \nExecute DOWN to (7,1) this turn. On the next turn, from (7,1), move LEFT to (6,1) and continue LEFT along y=1 toward (3,1) (about 4 LEFT moves from current plan). Monitor enemy (likely heading down to y=1 themselves); if they get too close to the bottom apples or block y=1, switch to pivoting UP or RIGHT toward mid-board options like (6,7) or (9,7) in subsequent turns to avoid entanglement or death. Maintain distance, prioritize eating unguarded apples, and preserve escape routes.\n\nDOWN",

Closer to no apples immediately.\n- LEFT to (1,3): Allows UP to (1,4), RIGHT back, DOWN to (1,2). Sets up future path to (0,4) apple via UP then LEFT.

Enemy head at (3, 7) could move UP to (3, 8) or DOWN to (3, 6), not colliding yet.\n  - DOWN to (1, 3) \u2192 Empty, safe. Follow-up: DOWN to (1, 2) (empty row2 x1:.), then toward open lower left areas. Less direct toward apples, potentially trapping if enemy squeezes into y=4-6 blockade.\n  - LEFT to (0, 4) \u2192 Empty (apple there), safe and advantageous: eat the apple, grow to length 12, gain point to 12 apples (enemy at 10). Follow-ups from (0, 4) include DOWN to (0, 3) for open space or UP (if enemy moves away) to loop back.\n  - RIGHT to (2, 4) \u2192 Own body (direct backward into body segment), immediate death.\n- Safest and most strategic: LEFT, as it progresses toward apple collection with immediate growth, keeping multiple paths (UP, DOWN) open post-growth. Avoids UP/DOWN until needed, as they might tighten space against enemy body in y=5-7.\n\n### Enemy Activity\n- Enemy head at (3, 7). Possible safe moves (all empty): UP to (3, 8), DOWN to (3, 6), LEFT to (2, 7). No threat to my moves this turn (heads won't collide unless we both aim for same cell, but we're not). Enemy seems aiming for upper-right apples like (9, 7) or (8, 5); their body bars y=5-6, but we're in y=4.\n\n### Long-term plan\nEat the (0, 4) apple by going LEFT, reaching length 12. From there (0, 4), immediately evaluate: prioritize DOWN to (0, 3) for breathing room and access to y=2-0 open areas, avoiding head-on with enemy if they push left. Avoid looping into dead ends in x=0 column (only safe until y=3). If enemy advances aggressively leftwards post-move, pivot defensively by going RIGHT from (0, 4) to (1, 4), using my length advantage. Target next apple at (1, 6) if upper area clears, but stay low to outmaneuver.\n\nLEFT",

Leaves vertical escape (DOWN from here to y=4-3 open).\n- Safest: Both UP and RIGHT, but RIGHT prioritizes immediate proximity to the close apple at (1, 6) (eat in 2 turns: RIGHT now, UP next), aligns with prior plan's progression, and widens x-space for future pivots right/up to bypass enemy y=7 block. UP is slightly more conservative for upper access but slower to apple.\n\n### Enemy Activity\n- Enemy head at (2, 6). Safe moves: UP to (2, 7) (empty), DOWN to (2, 5) (empty), LEFT to (1, 6) (apple, clear eat opportunity). RIGHT leads into body (backwards), death.\n- Likely enemy LEFT to (1, 6) for the nearby apple, potentially growing to 11 apples and blocking my path if I pursue that apple. However, moving RIGHT avoids direct competition this turn (enemy doesn't threaten (1, 5)), allowing me to flank or pivot elsewhere if enemy claims (1, 6). No immediate head-on risk with either my safes, but monitor enemy growth\u2014stay \u22652 apple lead to leverage for potential head-ons later.\n\n### Long-term plan\nRIGHT to (1, 5), UP to (1, 6) to eat and grow to 13 by turn 44. If enemy eats first, shift RIGHT/UP post-grow to (4, 9) or (8, 5) via x=1-4 open lanes, using y\u22644 avoidance. Exploit length edge for aggressive blocks; escape DOWN/RIGHT if enemy advances leftward. Aim for 15 apples by turn 50-55, surfacing right for distant apples.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Going DOWN from (3,5) to (4,4) is the only safe move that avoids all immediate dangers (UP/goes into enemy body at (3,6), LEFT goes directly into own body at (3,5) behind head, RIGHT would go to (4,5) safely but it limits follow-up moves too much and leaves me trapped in a tighter space with fewer options next turn). DOWN opens more paths (e.g., RIGHT to (5,4) for maneuvering, or further DOWN to (4,3) to explore), keeps me alive, and avoids tight spots while potentially allowing escape toward reachable apples like (9,7), (8,5), or (7,9) on the right/top\u2014apples near enemy but worth risking if it creates head-on or blocking opportunities to tie/stop them (enemy at 11 apples). Enemy head at (1,8) likely moves LEFT to (0,8) or RIGHT to (2,8)/further right toward apples (e.g., (5,8)), so my DOWN path positions me to counter by filling space rightward/downward, preventing enemy expansion while eye-ing a rightward sweep along y=4 to y=0 or up-right via timed UPs/RIGHTs.\n\nLong-term: Snake is trapped bottom-left by own/enemy bodies. Plan: Maneuver DOWN/RIGHT along y=4 toward x=9, then UP to eat right-side/top apples ((9,7), (8,5), (7,9)) while watching enemy head (likely RIGHT-leaning). If enemy heads right, try to block/interfere near x=5-9 area or force head-ons; if they go left, breakout faster up-right. Avoid UP traps; prioritize space and apple denial to hit 50 before them.\n\nDOWN",
