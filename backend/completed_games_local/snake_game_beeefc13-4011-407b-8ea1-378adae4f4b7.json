Apples everywhere, but we're ignoring them for now? Nah, we can use them as bait later. \ud83d\ude08\n\nFirst, check my possible moves:\n\n**UP** to (8,9): That's on the board. No body there. Enemy is at (9,6), far away. Safe.\n**DOWN** to (8,7): On board, empty. Safe.\n**LEFT** to (7,8): On board, empty. Safe.\n**RIGHT** to (9,8): On board, empty. Safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe immediately. But we gotta think about the enemy's possible moves from (9,6): He can go UP to (9,7), DOWN to (9,5), LEFT to (8,6), RIGHT is off board (dead). So he has three safe moves.\n\nWe want to be aggressive, but also not walk into a future trap. Right now, we have equal score. Head-on collision would kill us both \u2192 bad. So avoid moving toward his head directly this turn.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,8), I'm above him but not in his immediate path. He can't go RIGHT, so he'll likely go UP/LEFT/DOWN. If he goes UP to (9,7), he's closer to me but not same cell. Could set up a future pin.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7,8), I'm moving away from him toward center\u2014maybe too passive? But gives space.\n\nActually, long-term plan: I want to get between him and the center, cut off his movement. He's in the right column, so if I shift left, I control more board. But also, I want to be in position to chase him toward a wall.\n\n**Let's think about next turn safety**:  \nIf I go UP to (8,9), I'm top edge\u2014only 3 moves next turn (no UP). Limits options.  \nIf I go DOWN to (8,7), more central, keeps options open.  \nLEFT to (7,8) also central.  \nRIGHT to (9,8) puts me on right edge\u2014limits future a bit.\n\nSo DOWN or LEFT seem best for keeping future options.\n\nBut wait\u2014be AGGRESSIVE. He's at (9,6). If I go DOWN to (8,7), I'm south-east of him. If he goes LEFT to (8,6), we're adjacent diagonally\u2014could be risky next turn if we both move into same cell. But that's a maybe.\n\nActually, let's pick a move that starts boxing him: If I go LEFT to (7,8), I'm west of him. He's stuck near right wall. Next turn I can move south to (7,7) to block his leftward escape. That's the start of a trap! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udfaf\n\n**Plan for next turn**: Move toward (7,7) or (8,7) to cut off his leftward movement, force him up against right wall. Use apples as bait if he goes for them, but mainly constrict his space.\n\nLEFT sets up that control. DOWN is okay but less direct pressure. I'm going LEFT to start the squeeze!\n\nLEFT",

Apples are everywhere, but we're playing for BOARD CONTROL and AGGRESSION! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nFirst, check my possible moves from (7,8):\n\n**UP** to (7,9): On board. Currently empty. Safe.\n**DOWN** to (7,7): On board. Empty. Safe.\n**LEFT** to (6,8): On board. Empty. Safe.\n**RIGHT** to (8,8): On board. Empty. Safe.\n\nAll four are immediately safe. But we gotta think about where the enemy can go from (9,7):\n\nEnemy moves from (9,7):\n- UP to (9,8): Empty.\n- DOWN to (9,6): Empty.\n- LEFT to (8,7): Empty.\n- RIGHT: Off board \u2192 DEAD.\n\nSo he has three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nWe want to start BOXING HIM against the right wall! If we can get between him and the center, we limit his escape.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,8), I'm directly above his possible LEFT move to (8,7). That's adjacent diagonally\u2014could set up a future head-on risk next turn if we both move into (8,8) vs (8,7)? Actually, simultaneous moves: if I go RIGHT to (8,8) and he goes LEFT to (8,7), we're not colliding this turn. Next turn we'd be adjacent.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7,7), I'm south of his possible LEFT move to (8,7)\u2014again diagonal.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (6,8), I'm moving away from him\u2014maybe too passive? We want pressure!\n\nIf I go UP to (7,9), I'm top edge\u2014limits my future moves.\n\n**AGGRESSIVE PLAY**: We have equal length (1). Head-on collision would kill us both \u2192 avoid direct same-cell moves this turn. But we can move to cut off his escape.\n\nLook at his position: he's stuck on the right edge (x=9). If I move to (8,8), I'm blocking his path upward along that column? Not really, he can still go UP to (9,8). But if I'm at (8,8), next turn I could go LEFT or DOWN to further block.\n\nActually, the BEST immediate boxing move might be **DOWN to (7,7)**. Why? Because from (7,7), next turn I can move to (8,7) or (7,6) to directly block his leftward escape route from (9,7). If he goes LEFT this turn to (8,7), and I go DOWN to (7,7), we're diagonal. Next turn if he stays or moves, I can intercept.\n\nBut wait\u2014what if he goes UP to (9,8) this turn? Then my (7,7) is far. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, going **RIGHT to (8,8)** puts me closer to him now. If he goes LEFT to (8,7), we're adjacent next turn. I could then move DOWN to (8,7) if he moves away? Risky.\n\nLet's think about FUTURE SAFETY: I want to keep my options open. (7,7) is more central than (8,8). (8,8) is on the right edge\u2014limits my RIGHT moves later.\n\nAlso, apples: There's an apple at (7,9) above me, (5,8), (6,9) etc. But we're not chasing apples yet\u2014we're hunting the enemy! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN**: Start squeezing him against the right wall. Move to (7,7) this turn. Next turn, if he's at (9,8), I can move toward (8,8) to block. If he's at (8,7), I can move to (8,7) to force a head-on? But equal length \u2192 both die. So maybe move to (8,6) to cut off his down escape. We'll adapt.\n\nFor now, DOWN to (7,7) gives me flexibility and starts the encirclement! Let's go!\n\nDOWN",

Apples are everywhere, but we're HUNTING! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nFirst, check my possible moves from (7,7):\n\n**UP** to (7,8): On board. Currently empty. Safe.\n**DOWN** to (7,6): On board. Empty. Safe.\n**LEFT** to (6,7): On board. Empty. Safe.\n**RIGHT** to (8,7): On board. Empty. Safe.\n\nAll four are immediately safe. But we gotta think about where the enemy can go from (9,8):\n\nEnemy moves from (9,8):\n- UP to (9,9): On board, has an apple at (9,9)!\n- DOWN to (9,7): On board, empty.\n- LEFT to (8,8): On board, empty.\n- RIGHT: Off board \u2192 DEAD.\n\nSo he has three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nWe want to BOX HIM against the right wall! He's already on the edge (x=9). If he goes UP to (9,9), he eats an apple and grows to length 2. We want to prevent his escape inward!\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (8,7)**, I'm directly below his possible LEFT move to (8,8). That's diagonal. Next turn, if he's at (8,8), I could move UP to (8,8) for a head-on? But equal length \u2192 both die. Not ideal yet.\n\nIf I go **UP to (7,8)**, I'm moving away from him\u2014maybe too passive? We want pressure!\n\nIf I go **LEFT to (6,7)**, I'm moving even farther away\u2014giving him space. NO!\n\nIf I go **DOWN to (7,6)**, I'm moving south, maybe setting up a future block but not immediate pressure.\n\n**AGGRESSIVE PLAY**: We need to cut off his LEFT escape! The most threatening path for him to get off the wall is LEFT to (8,8). If I position myself to threaten (8,8) next turn, I can force him to stay on the edge.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT to (8,7)** this turn, next turn I can go **UP to (8,8)** if he's there, forcing a head-on if he stays. But if he goes UP to (9,9) this turn, then my (8,7) is still close.\n\nActually, wait\u2014what if he goes DOWN to (9,7) this turn? Then my (8,7) is directly to his LEFT. Next turn, if he goes LEFT to (8,7), we'd collide if I stay? Hmm.\n\nLet's think SIMULTANEOUS moves this turn: If I go RIGHT to (8,7) and he goes LEFT to (8,8), we end up at (8,7) and (8,8)\u2014adjacent vertically. That's fine.\n\nBut if I go RIGHT to (8,7) and he goes DOWN to (9,7), we end up at (8,7) and (9,7)\u2014adjacent horizontally. Also fine.\n\nThe RISK is if I go RIGHT to (8,7) and he goes LEFT to (8,8), then NEXT turn if I go UP to (8,8) and he goes DOWN to (8,7), we swap and die? Actually, simultaneous: if we both move into each other's previous cell, we'd pass through? No, head-on collision only if we move into the SAME cell. So if I go UP to (8,8) and he goes DOWN to (8,7), we go to different cells. So safe.\n\n**BEST MOVE**: RIGHT to (8,7). It applies immediate pressure, stays close, and sets up a potential block next turn. It also keeps my options open (from (8,7) I can go UP, DOWN, LEFT next turn).\n\nWe're EQUAL length, so avoid direct head-on for now. But we can maneuver to trap him!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Keep him pinned on the right wall. From (8,7), next turn I can move to (8,8) if he's there, or (9,7) if he's there, to threaten a head-on if I ever get longer. For now, just position aggressively and limit his moves!\n\nRIGHT",

We're both length 1, so head-on collision kills both. Gotta be smart.\n\nFirst, check my moves from (8,7):\n\n**UP** to (8,8): That's the enemy's current head! If he stays there, we collide and both die. If he moves away, it's empty. Risky \u2014 depends on his move.\n**DOWN** to (8,6): On board, empty. Safe.\n**LEFT** to (7,7): On board, empty. Safe.\n**RIGHT** to (9,7): On board, empty. Safe.\n\nNow, think about HIS possible moves from (8,8):\n- UP to (8,9): On board, empty.\n- DOWN to (8,7): That's our current head! If he goes DOWN and we stay, he dies hitting us. If we move away, it's empty.\n- LEFT to (7,8): On board, empty.\n- RIGHT to (9,8): On board, empty.\n\nSo he has four safe moves.\n\nWe want to AGGRESS but not suicide. If we go UP, we risk him staying still (unlikely but possible) or him going DOWN (then we swap places, no collision). Actually, if we go UP to (8,8) and he goes DOWN to (8,7), we pass each other \u2014 that's safe! Head-on only if we go into the SAME cell simultaneously. So UP is safe unless he also goes UP? Wait, if we both go UP, he goes to (8,9), we go to (8,8) \u2014 different cells. So UP is actually safe in all cases? Let's check:\n\n- He stays: we go to (8,8) while he's at (8,8) \u2192 SAME CELL \u2192 COLLISION.\n- He goes UP: he to (8,9), us to (8,8) \u2192 fine.\n- He goes DOWN: he to (8,7), us to (8,8) \u2192 fine.\n- He goes LEFT: he to (7,8), us to (8,8) \u2192 fine.\n- He goes RIGHT: he to (9,8), us to (8,8) \u2192 fine.\n\nOnly danger is if he STAYS. Snakes can't stay still \u2014 must move. So he won't be at (8,8) next turn. So UP is actually SAFE! And it puts us right where he was \u2014 dominating his space!\n\nBut wait \u2014 going UP also risks next turn if he loops around? But more importantly, going UP might let him get behind us? Hmm.\n\nWhat about going LEFT to (7,7)? That creates distance \u2014 maybe too passive. We want to pressure!\n\nRIGHT to (9,7) pushes us to the right wall \u2014 could limit our own options later.\n\nDOWN to (8,6) moves away from him \u2014 gives him room.\n\n**AGGRESSIVE TRAP**: If we go UP to (8,8), we occupy his old spot. He likely won't go DOWN into (8,7) because we just left it empty \u2014 but actually, if he goes DOWN to (8,7), that's fine. Next turn, we'd be at (8,8), he'd be at (8,7). We could then go DOWN to (8,7) if he's still there? That would be a head-on if he stays, but we can adapt.\n\nActually, better plan: Let's think about cutting off his escape from the right edge. He's at (8,8) now, not on the edge. If we go UP to (8,8), we're basically mirroring him last turn \u2014 but we want to force him toward the wall.\n\nWhat if we go LEFT to (7,7)? Then he might go RIGHT to (9,8), closer to wall. Not bad.\n\nBut I think the MOST AGGRESSIVE and controlling move is **UP**. It asserts dominance, takes the cell he just left, and stays directly adjacent to him next turn no matter where he goes (unless he goes far). It also sets up a potential head-on next turn if we grow first.\n\nWe're equal length, so avoid deliberate head-on now. But UP doesn't cause head-on this turn. It's safe.\n\nLet's lock in UP. We're going to shadow him tightly and wait for an apple advantage to strike!\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR NEXT TURN:** We're at (8,8) if we go UP. Enemy will be adjacent somewhere. Track his move. If we can get an apple next turn to grow longer, we can threaten head-on collision with advantage. Keep him near walls, limit his safe moves. Look for apples at (9,9) or (8,9) maybe. Avoid getting trapped in corners ourselves.\n\nUP",

Then if we go to (9,9) next turn, we'd hit his body (his tail would be at (8,9)? Wait, if he moves from (8,9) to (9,9) and eats, his tail stays at (8,9) for now? Actually when you eat, you grow at the end of the turn \u2014 so his head moves to (9,9), his tail stays at (8,9) (since length was 1, now length 2, body becomes [head at (9,9), tail at (8,9)]). So (8,9) becomes his body segment. If we go UP this turn to (8,9), we'd be moving into his future body? No \u2014 this turn simultaneous: he moves from (8,9) to somewhere, we move from (8,8) to somewhere. If we go UP to (8,9), we arrive at (8,9) same time he leaves it. So it's empty when we get there. His tail only stays at (8,9) if he doesn't move \u2014 but he must move. So safe.\n\nBut next turn, his body will include (8,9) if he ate and grew? Wait, if he moves from (8,9) to (9,9) and eats, his body becomes: head (9,9), tail (8,9). So (8,9) is his tail. That means next turn, (8,9) is occupied by his body \u2014 so we shouldn't go there next turn. But we can deal with that later.\n\nPLAN: Go UP to (8,9) to pressure. If he goes RIGHT to (9,9) and eats, he's longer \u2014 then we avoid head-on. If he goes LEFT to (7,9), we're adjacent. If he goes DOWN to (8,8), we swap \u2014 then we're at (8,9), he's at (8,8) \u2014 we're above him.\n\nThat feels good \u2014 we stay close, limit his moves, maybe force him toward wall.\n\nNEXT TURN STRATEGY: We'll be at (8,9). He'll be adjacent. If he's longer, avoid direct collision. If equal, maybe try to get an apple first. Watch for apples at (9,9), (7,9), etc. Keep him near top edge to reduce his safe moves.\n\nLET'S GO UP \u2014 AGGRESSIVE SHADOWING! \ud83d\ude24\n\nUP",
