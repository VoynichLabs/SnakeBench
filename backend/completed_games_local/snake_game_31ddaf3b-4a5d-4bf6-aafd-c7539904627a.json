Auto-throw, ignore.\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,9), safe, but still stuck on the top border with only 3 neighbors next turn.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,9), also safe, also hugging top border with only 3 neighbors next turn; does point us toward a nice apple line on the right.\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,8), fully inside the board with 4 neighbors next turn (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Maximum flexibility.\n\nOpponent\u2019s options from (1,7): (1,8), (1,6), (0,7), (2,7). None collide with any of our three safe moves this turn, so no immediate head-on threat. That means we should optimize for space and future options, not a coin-flip fight.\n\nHugging the top edge (LEFT/RIGHT) early reduces our mobility and makes it easier for future traps; going DOWN moves us into the center lane where we\u2019ll have:\n- More escape routes\n- Better long-term control paths to eventually sweep toward the enemy side\n- A safer platform to decide whether we race for right-side apples or rotate down toward mid-board to cut them off later\n\nSo: we drop off the top line, take center control, and keep all doors open.\n\nLong-term note to future me:\n- Prioritize central control over instant apple races.\n- Use our central position to pivot: if the enemy commits left/top, swing right and grow; if they rush center, work on flanking paths that can eventually wall them off.\n- Avoid early head-on collisions while scores are tied; only force those once we\u2019re ahead in apples and length.\n\nDOWN",

Heading back into the grind against this loser Snake #0 \u2013 he's already quivering at (4,9), ain't he? \ud83d\ude0e We're at (1,7), no body yet, both at zero apples, but we're about to get vulgar with that apple grind and start dominating this 10x10 board. Think we're letting him slide? Nah, we're plotting to box him in, crash him out, and force those head-ons when the score favors us! \ud83d\udca5\n\nAlright, LET'S BREAK THIS DOWN LIVE \u2013 pure skill, no BS!\n\nFirst, possible moves from (1,7)? All directions on the board, no body to worry about slamming into, and #0's at (4,9) screaming distance, but his one-move options won't cross ours yet. Can't move backwards into nothing anyway. Time to eliminate the garbage: no off-board, no self-own (easy peasy), no into #0's current spot \u2013 wait, if we BOTH go to the SAME CELL, BOOM double KO, but we're smarter than that trash, right chat? \ud83d\ude0f We're assuming he's aggressive too, so avoid spots he might rush, but for now, all four are safe: UP (1,8), DOWN (1,6), LEFT (0,7), RIGHT (2,7). NONE kill us immediately, praise the gods!\n\nNow, among these MVPs, what's gonna juice our apple juice and keep options WIDE OPEN? Hate getting boxed in, don't we? Avoid dead-end vibes \u2013 LEFT to (0,7) looks tasty (apple there!), but boom, after eating, we'd be at (0,7) with body at (1,7), and ONLY UP or DOWN safe (LEFT off-board, RIGHT into body \u2013 NOPE). That's amateur hour, getting cornered early! UP to (1,8)? Open af, but no apple, and we're slowing our grind. DOWN (1,6)? No apple, open but meh, not growing. RIGHT to (2,7) tho? \ud83d\udc40 STRAIGHT TO AN APPLE! EAT IT LIVE, grow to 1, slap on that point, and we're at (2,7) with tons of follow-ups: UP to (2,8) for ANOTHER apple, RIGHT (3,7), DOWN (2,6), LEFT back? Nope, but we got SPACE to maneuver! Closer to reachable apples (that UPPER row's loaded), dominates midfield, and sets up BOXING #0 IN from the side. If he drops down from (4,9), we're positioned to force a collision when WE'RE BIGGER! Plus, chat, it's aggressive \u2013 we're advancing, not retreating like a coward. Score stays tied at zero, but not for long! This keeps us UNTRAPPED, apple-farming machines, and ready to crush skulls. \ud83d\ude08 Boom, RIGHT it is!\n\nQuick strategy note to my future ruthless self: YO, remember, we're EATING THOSE UPPER APPLES ((2,8), (1,7) is done, aim north!) to grow HUGE and CUT OFF #0's paths from (4,9). If he dives south or right, flank him, force crashes when we're ahead. Box him into the top-right corner, don't let him expand left or down \u2013 dominate with size, chat! Keep options open, no dead-ends next turn! We're ending this chump FAST! \ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Head at (2,7), body at (1,7) from that dope RIGHT move last turn \u2013 we snagged the apple grind, scores ticking, and #0's still shivering at (4,8) with ZERO, no body, loser status! Time to plot the BOX-IN, keep advancing north, eat those UPPER APPLES like (2,8), grow HUGE, and CUT OFF #0's paths from the top-right corner. Don't let this chump expand left or down \u2013 flank him, force HEAD-ONS when we're THICKER Than his twiggy self, and end this scrub FAST! We're going FULL AGGRO, chat, no mercy! \ud83d\udca5\n\nAlright, BREAK IT DOWN LIVE \u2013 pure skills on deck, no web BS, all gut feel! From (2,7), gotta eye all four: UP (2,8), DOWN (2,6), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7). Trash those instant deaths \u2013 LEFT to (1,7)? Nah, that's backwards into our own TAIL segment, classic self-own, you're DEAD, idiot move! Off-board? Nope from here. Into #0's body? He got none yet. Into his head? Not doing that yet, walls on his spot = bad. So valid plays: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. We're SIMULTANEOUS killers here, so assume #0's rushing too \u2013 avoid spots where his dumb head might bum-rush for a double KO. We're smarter, right chat? \ud83d\ude08 Favor juice: grow big, options OPEN wide (no dead-ends or tight traps), stalk those apples fierce, and position to dominate board control. Score sits 1-0 us \u2013 let's JUICE IT!\n\nUP to (2,8)? BOOM, STRAIGHT INTO AN APPLE! EAT IT, grow to 2 apples sweating, body slaps at old head (2,7) and tail (1,7), we're THICKER than BEFORE! Options? From (2,8), RIGHT (3,8), DOWN (2,7 into body? Nope, but actually we can't go back anyway), LEFT (1,8), and more space north/up. Climbing to the top-LEFT apples gang, setting up to BLOCK #0 at (4,8) from his RIGHT or DOWN escape \u2013 if he dives right to (5,8) or down to (4,7), we flank hard, potentially force a crash when we're HEAD AND OPTIMALS ahouder! Plus, Dom woodworking the upper midfield, apples at (5,5), (6,2) in reach soon. Aggressive as hell, scores skyRocket, keeps us UNTRAPPED \u2013 no walls closing in immediate. DOWN to (2,6)? Opens space, but NO apple juice right there, meh growth, farther from upper grabs, letting #0 breathe easy midboard. Could flank a bit, but passive \u2013 we not here to turtle, chat! RIGHT to (3,7)? Solid open, closer to #0's lane at (4,8), but again, NO apple eat here, score stays low at 1, meh. Sets up maybe east, but UP IS APPLE KING \u2013 grow NOW, dominate LATER! If #0's plotting smart (doubt it), UP distances us a tad safety, avoids rushing his potential LEFT to (3,8) or something for now. But we're building size to outsize him for head-on glory! Yo, this keeps MULTIPLE follow-ups (RIGHT, LEFT, maybe up more if apples spawn? Pffft, but based on board, yeah) and advances THE GRIND. Who's afraid of getting close? NOT US! \ud83d\ude0f Boom, UP it is \u2013 let's GO BIG OR DIE TRYING!\n\nQuick strategy note to my future savage self: YO, we've eaten (2,8), now we're at (2,8) looking HUUGE with 2-0 lead. Target NEXT upper apples like (1,8)? Wait, check (6,9), (7,9), (9,9) in top-right \u2013 BOX #0 into that corner from the LEFT flank, eat 'em to become MONSTER, CUT OFF his paths south or left. If he tries south at (4,7) or right (5,8), zig zag to intercept, force collision if we're bigger. Keep eyes on score diff \u2013 we're aiming for apple glory AND trap-tastic dominance. No dead-ends, keep aggressive, end this joke before 150 turns. Chat's got our back, now CRUSH! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

We lose central control.\n- This is too passive and reduces our ability to shape their path. Reject.\n\n**RIGHT to (5,8):**\n- Safer in terms of distance from the enemy, and great for drifting toward right-side apples.\n- But: this also *opens the gate* for them to move right into central space while we float off even farther right.\n- We want to be the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d between them and the main open field, not running away from the gate. Too soft, not the vibe.\n\n**LEFT to (3,8):**\n- Aggressive: we step closer to them and stand above their possible UP move to (2,8).\n- If they:\n  - Go UP to (2,8), we end up at (3,8) adjacent to them; we threaten them, but they\u2019ve also just gotten longer and further locked to the left/top.\n  - Go RIGHT to (3,7), we\u2019re stacked directly above them, good for pressure.\n- Downside: we shift toward the left side, *away* from the large right-side apple cluster that we eventually want to dominate.\n- Also slightly reduces our \u201cgatekeeping\u201d advantage (being clearly to their right and central).\n\n**DOWN to (4,7):**\n- Keeps us in the central band, same y as the enemy, and crucially still to their **right** (x=4 vs x=2).\n- This makes us the barrier between them and the apple-rich right half.\n- Follow-up options from (4,7) are excellent:\n  - RIGHT to (5,7) (apple),\n  - DOWN to (4,6) (apple),\n  - UP back to (4,8),\n  - LEFT toward them if we want to contest space.\n- If they go UP to (2,8) for the apple, they\u2019re pushed further left/top while we sit in the middle lane with easy access to multiple apples and escape routes.\n- If they go RIGHT to (3,7), we line up side-by-side (our head (4,7), theirs (3,7)), giving us direct influence over whether they can cross center.\n- If they go DOWN to (2,6), they tuck under us on the left; we still own the middle.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of central, controlling, \u201cyou stay on your side of the map\u201d posture we want while we\u2019re slightly behind on apples and length.\n\nSo the play this turn: **step DOWN into the central row, stay to their right, and become the gatekeeper of the board.**\n\nLong-term note to future me:\n- Priority for the next ~3\u20135 turns: keep our body between the enemy and the right-side apple cluster while casually picking up 1\u20132 nearby apples (especially (5,7) and (4,6)) to close the apple gap.\n- Avoid any head-on collision setups until apple count is at least tied or we\u2019re clearly longer; once we\u2019re ahead, we can start deliberately offering high-pressure lines where a head-on is a winning coin flip for us.\n- Use our central position to slowly curve a \u201cwall\u201d that pushes them into the left/top corner, then look for chances where their escape options force them toward either:\n  - our body (where they die if they hit it), or\n  - a head-on line where we\u2019re winning on apples.\n\nDOWN",

Time to ramp up the AGGRESSION, stalk his pathetic ass, and force that head-on doom when we're fat and he's scrawny! Remember, simultaneous moves mean no cheap outs \u2013 he's plotting too, but we're the predators here. Double-KO if we collide? Fine by me, cause our score's DOUBLED, we'll snatch the win even in flames \ud83d\udd25 Who's scared of a little gamble when chat's hyping the kill shots?\n\nBREAKDOWN TIME: From (2,8), eyeing all four \u2013 UP (2,9), DOWN (2,7 \u2013 nah, that's straight into our own neck, instant DEAD-BY-DUMBASS, can't reverse into the segment right behind head), LEFT (1,8), RIGHT (3,8). Off-board? Pfft, not a chance. Into #0's non-existent body? Nope. Into our own mess? Already trashed DOWN. Self-own in other ways? Nah, we're not THAT dumb. So valid: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Keep it OPEN, kid \u2013 MULTIPLE paths forward, no traps, apples in sight for GROWTH bombs, and position to DOMINATE this scrub before he even breathes. We're ahead 2-0, so let's JUICE it, ambush his moves, and end this joke early \u2013 force collisions where he dies, and if we go down? Hell, we take the W anyway! Who's the ruthless king? US, baby!\n\nUP to (2,9)? Climbs high, away from immediate heat, opens paths left (1,9), right (3,9) \u2013 fluffy options for now. Apples? None right there, but sets up flanking #0 from the top-left, easing into that top-right box we talked about last turn. Could zigzag down soon to intercept if he dives south. No apples eaten this turn, but keeps distance, avoids rushing his potential RIGHT to (5,7 \u2013 that juicy apple at (5,7)!). Passive AF for our aggressive blood, though \u2013 we not here to watch, right?\n\nLEFT to (1,8)? Heads west, towards emptier space. From there, UP (1,9) or LEFT (0,8) keep it going, but DOWN's a killer (into our tail at (1,7) \u2013 dead in the water, no thank you), and RIGHT's reversed dumbness. Apples? Zilch nearby, but might steer clear of #0's lane, grow laterally. Meh on aggression \u2013 he's not over here; what's the trap? Not our style to run sideways.\n\nRIGHT to (3,8)? BOOM, charges EAST, RIGHT into his side lane at (4,7)! Opens HUGE: UP (3,9), DOWN (3,7 \u2013 perfect for bursting his bubble), RIGHT (4,8). Why? We can FLANK his ass if he goes RIGHT to nom that (5,7) apple, or intercept LEFT moves to (3,7), force head-ons when we're thicker. No apple this second, but positions PERFECT for growth chases \u2013 down gets us to (4,6)'s apple soon, or upright towards (5,5). Aggressive as hell, chat \u2013 let's muscle in, box him south/east, and CRASH him out if he dares peek. Assuming he'll eat (5,7) if he goes RIGHT, we cut him off, dominate the midboard, and spiral bigger for that fat score gap. Who's playing scared? NOT THIS GANG! \ud83d\ude08 Plus, keeps MULTIPLE exits \u2013 no dead-ends like LEFT's trap.\n\nPicking RIGHT, lights out for this loser soon. Favor open lion, apple hunting ground, and enemy domination \u2013 RIGHT flanks his weak spot, avoids passive UP vibes, and ditches LEFT's narrow future. Assuming #0's rushing (5,7), right keeps us relevant to BLOCK and CLASH. Yo, we're building to MONSTER status, crush him before turn 150, no draws!\n\nQuick strategy note to savage future me: Eaten zero this turn, still 2-0 at (3,8) rolling. Target MID-BOARD apples like (4,6) down next, or (5,5) right-away to keep growing MONSTROUS \u2013 aim for 30+\u4e8b\u5b9f apples FAST, but flank #0 aggressively. If he eats (5,7) this turn, intercept from right flank, force south trap near (4,6) or east choke at (5,8), and hit head-ons when we outsize his bony self. Stay UNTRAPPED, chat-boggled, end this scrub brutally. If he moves LEFT towards us, BOOM him at (3,7) next \u2013 double KO our way to glory with score lead!

Let\u2019s set this up.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Our head: (4,7), length 1\n- Enemy head: (2,8), body: (2,7),(1,7), length 3, apples 2\n- We\u2019re behind on apples, so we CANNOT afford a double-KO yet (they win the tiebreak).\n\nAdjacent cells for us from (4,7):\n- UP \u2192 (4,8) \u2013 empty\n- DOWN \u2192 (4,6) \u2013 apple\n- LEFT \u2192 (3,7) \u2013 empty\n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,7) \u2013 apple\n\nEnemy options from (2,8):\n- UP \u2192 (2,9) \u2013 empty\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,8) \u2013 empty\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,8) \u2013 empty\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,7) \u2013 backwards into own body, effectively suicidal\n\nThey cannot reach any of our four target squares in one move, so there is no immediate head-on this turn on any of our moves.\n\nNow apply the rules:\n\n1) Kill moves?\n- None of our four moves hit a body or go out of bounds. All four are immediately safe.\n\n2) Among safe moves, we want:\n   - Growth (apples) because we\u2019re behind 0\u20132.\n   - Central control that keeps us between enemy and the rich right-side apples.\n\nSo:\n- UP to (4,8): no apple, loses the central row we just fought for. Weak.\n- LEFT to (3,7): no apple and moves us closer to them while staying smaller. Increases risk of being forced into a losing trade later.\n- DOWN to (4,6): apple, gives us length 2, head (4,6), body (4,7). Central, good, 3 follow-up options (L/R/D).\n- RIGHT to (5,7): apple, gives us length 2, head (5,7), body (4,7). Still clearly to their right, still central, and even closer to the big right/top apple cluster. Also 3 good follow-ups (U/D/R).\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT give us growth and three safe follow-ups. The tiebreak is positional:\n\n- After DOWN: we drop to y=6, a bit farther from the top-row apple cluster and slightly loosen the immediate vertical pressure on them.\n- After RIGHT: we stay on y=7, just to the right of their column, better positioned to:\n  - Keep \u201cgatekeeping\u201d the center,\n  - Race them to the top-right apples later,\n  - Build a horizontal wall between them and the right side as we grow.\n\nNo head-on risk arises next turn from going RIGHT (they still can\u2019t get to our next-step squares in one move). So the aggressive but safe value play is to eat at (5,7).\n\nLong-term note to future me:\n- Priority: keep growing on the central/right apples (5,7) \u2192 (5,5)/(4,6)/(6,4) while staying between enemy and the top-right cluster.\n- Avoid any double-KO setups until our apples are at least tied; once we\u2019re equal or ahead on apples/length, start looking for lines where we can threaten a head-on that they can\u2019t easily decline.\n- Use our body as a shifting \u201cwall\u201d around x\u22484\u20136 to gradually shove them into the left/top corner and shrink their safe space.\n\nRIGHT",

If he LEFTs? Impossible dumbass, but ready to BLAST. Raw skill, baby! \ud83d\udd25\n\nQuick strategy note to savage future me: Cruisin' at (4,8) post-RIGHT, lead widening \u2013 eagle-eye opponent's moves for ambushes, hit (4,6) apple fast to bulk OUT at 3 body+, dominate midboard, flank south/east for traps around (5,5).

If both play well, they can reach their next apple as fast as we reach ours, keeping us behind on score.\n\n3) DOWN to (5,6)\n- This is the key tempo move.\n- From (5,6) next turn we have:\n  - DOWN to (5,5) apple in 1 move,\n  - LEFT to (4,6) apple in 1 move.\n- Enemy\u2019s nearest apple from (3,8) is (4,6) in 3 moves: DOWN \u2192 DOWN \u2192 RIGHT.\n- If we go DOWN, then:\n  - Turn 3: (5,7) \u2192 (5,6)\n  - Turn 4: we can already grab an apple at (4,6) or (5,5), reaching 2 apples before they can reach 3.\n- That means we hit score parity (2\u20132) earlier, which is huge: once apples are tied, a double-KO at least gives us a draw instead of an auto-loss.\n- Positionally, (5,6) is still central; we\u2019re at x=5 while they\u2019re at x=3, keeping us between them and the right side of the board. We can still build a vertical/horizontal wall from the middle later to box them to the left/top, but with more length.\n\nGiven:\n- We must avoid close-contact brawls while behind on apples,\n- We want to equalize score as fast as possible,\n- We still want to hold central control rather than drifting off to a corner,\n\nDOWN is the best blend of aggression (fast growth) and long-term board control.\n\nLong-term note to future me:\n- From (5,6), prioritize grabbing one of the two nearby apples:\n  - If enemy goes DOWN toward center, take (4,6) first to steal their closest apple and hit 2\u20132.\n  - If enemy goes UP toward the top cluster, consider (5,5) first for quick growth, then swing back up through (4,6)/(6,4) to rebuild a thick central wall.\n- Once apples are tied or we\u2019re ahead, start looking for ways to constrict their space on the left side and set up lines where they are forced either into our body or into a losing head-on.\n\nDOWN",

Nah, we're not hiding \u2013 he could zig south or east, we miss the rush! DOWN to (4,7) dives straight into the chaos, teases that juicy (4,6) apple setup while flaking his south routes \u2013 from (4,7) next, DOWN to eat and GROW, or LEFT (3,7) to circle back, RIGHT? Hell yeah, multi-options, aggressive flank to cut his (5,5) dreams short! If he dares LEFT into (4,6) next? SLAM him head-on if I time it right with our score EDGE \u2013 DOUBLE KO, WE WIN! Keeps us mobile, no dead-ends, just ruthless pressure! Oh, and hitting his body? DOWN doesn't touch (5,7). Sweet!\n\nRIGHT to (5,8)? CHARGE, baby, deeper into his lane, setup UPs, DOWNs, even LEFT (4,8) pullout \u2013 body stays clear, no crash now. Future? From there, maybe DOWN chase his tail at (5,7) once he shifts, force a messy collision or apple steals. Apples like (5,5) bait him? We OWN the lead, aggressive AF \u2013 cut his RIGHT escapes, box from east, make him panic into traps! Who's scared? NOT US, but gotta WATCH that (4,6) lure him west. \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP to (4,9)?

We got the score LEAD, let's USE IT \u2013 force collisions where HE dies, we live or win KO glory! If he eats next turn? FIGHT BACK, grow faster, butcher him before turn 150!! Who's the assassin? US, locking in the flank rush! \ud83d\ude08\n\nQuick strategy note to FUTURE ME: Cruisin' at (4,7) after DOWN \u2013 eagle-eye for his NEXT move, EAT that (4,6) apple IMMEDIATELY next turn to bulk to 3 apples (length 4 body!) and DOMINATE midboard traps around (5,5). If he dives south/east, CHASE with RIGHT (5,7) leading crashes, SLAM head-ons with lead edge. Keep MULTI exits ALWAYS (LEFT/DOWN/UP from safety), ruthlessly GROW while boxing his paths \u2013 force dead-ends, assassinate growth, END THIS STREAM VICTORY STYLE.

If we trade heads right now, we LOSE the tiebreak. Not acceptable. \ud83d\udc80\n\nWe gotta:\n1. Stay alive (duh),\n2. Catch up on apples ASAP,\n3. Start setting up that juicy box-in on the left/top side.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves\n\nOur head is at (5,6):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (5,7)**  \n  That\u2019s literally our own body segment. Also directly backwards. Instant suicide. \ud83d\udeab  \n  \u2192 ELIMINATED.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (5,5)**  \n  There\u2019s an apple here. Safe from any immediate collision:\n  - Enemy is at (4,8). Their possible moves this turn:\n    - UP \u2192 (4,9)\n    - DOWN \u2192 (4,7)\n    - RIGHT \u2192 (5,8)\n    - LEFT \u2192 (3,8) is backwards into their body \u2192 illegal for them.\n  None of those hit (5,5). So DOWN is safe **this turn** and gives us apple #2.\n\n  But look at the follow-up:\n  - After we go to (5,5), we\u2019ll be at 2 apples, length 3: [(5,5),(5,6),(5,7)].\n  - From (4,8), if they go DOWN to (4,7), next turn they can take **(4,6)** (their closest apple).\n  So sequence:\n  - Turn 4: we eat (5,5) \u2192 apples 2\u20132.\n  - Turn 5: they eat (4,6) \u2192 apples 3\u20132 AGAIN.\n  We catch up only to immediately fall behind again and we **don\u2019t** deny them their best apple. Meh.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (4,6)**  \n  Apple right there. Also their **closest apple** (distance 2 from their head).  \n  Safety check this turn:\n  - We go from (5,6) \u2192 (4,6).\n  - Enemy from (4,8) can go:\n    - UP \u2192 (4,9)\n    - DOWN \u2192 (4,7)\n    - RIGHT \u2192 (5,8)\n  None of those are (4,6), so no head-on this turn. \u2705\n\n  After we move LEFT and eat:\n  - Our new body: head (4,6) \u2192 (5,6) \u2192 (5,7). Length 3, apples: 2.\n  - Enemy likely goes DOWN to (4,7) chasing toward where the apple *was*.\n\n  Board then:\n  - Us: (4,6),(5,6),(5,7)\n  - Them: (4,7),(4,8),(3,8)\n\n  Effects:\n  - Score: **2\u20132** (we equalize).\n  - Length: both length 3 \u2192 equal.\n  - We **steal** their nearest apple and centralize our body as a chunky wall at x=4\u20135, y=6\u20137.\n  - From (4,6) we keep **three** good options next turn:\n    - UP \u2192 (4,7)\n    - DOWN \u2192 (4,5)\n    - LEFT \u2192 (3,6)\n  Beautiful flexibility.\n\n  And here\u2019s the nasty part \ud83d\ude0f:\n  - If they end up above us at (4,7), on the next turn we can often step LEFT to (3,6).\n  - If they then greedily go DOWN into (4,6) (currently our head), that cell becomes our body segment after we move.\n  - Their head entering our body = **THEY DIE**. We live. Content farmed. \ud83e\ude78\n\n  Even if they play smart and avoid that, we still:\n  - Equalize score,\n  - Deny their best apple,\n  - Maintain central control to later box them toward the top-left.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (6,6)**  \n  Safe this turn (no snakes, no wall).  \n  But:\n  - No apple.\n  - We stay at 1 apple vs their 2.\n  - We also drift **away** from the double-apple cluster (4,6 and 5,5) that we\u2019re currently dominating.\n  Meanwhile they likely step DOWN \u2192 (4,7) then (4,6) and go up 3\u20131.\n  This is way too passive. We\u2019re trying to **hunt**, not kite. \u274c\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare the good moves: LEFT vs DOWN\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN:\n- Are safe this turn,\n- Give us an apple (we reach 2 apples, length 3),\n- Keep multiple safe follow-up moves.\n\nKey differences:\n\n- **DOWN to (5,5)**:\n  - We get apple #2 but **do not** interfere with their fastest apple (4,6).\n  - Very likely next turns:\n    - Turn 4: score 2\u20132,\n    - Turn 5: they eat (4,6) \u2192 score 3\u20132 (they\u2019re ahead again).\n  - Positional: we slide slightly lower, and they get to control the central lane at y=6.\n\n- **LEFT to (4,6)**:\n  - We get apple #2 **AND** deny them their best apple.\n  - We end turn at **equal score** and **equal length**.\n  - We stay in the central band (y=6) with a strong shape to start forming a horizontal/vertical barrier.\n  - We create immediate tactical pressure: them above us, with chances to bait them into running head-first into our growing wall.\n  - From here, we can still pivot:\n    - Downward into (4,5) then right toward the 4th-row apples,\n    - Or left and up to start squeezing them into the upper-left.\n\nThis is exactly what we want: aggressive, contested-space play that doesn\u2019t risk a losing head trade while we\u2019re behind. LEFT is pure value.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Note to future me (next few turns plan)\n\n- After moving LEFT to (4,6), watch what enemy does:\n  - If they go **DOWN to (4,7)**:\n    - Consider stepping **LEFT to (3,6)** next to set up a situation where any greedy move DOWN by them hits our body at (4,6).\n    - Keep building a horizontal wall across y=6 or y=5 to start slicing the board and limiting their escape routes to the left/top.\n  - If they go **UP to (4,9)** or **RIGHT to (5,8)**:\n    - We\u2019ve completely stolen their closest apple; pivot into controlling center-bottom:\n      - DOWN toward (4,5)/(2,4)/(6,4) apples,\n      - Maintain a long, thick body running across the middle rows to eventually box them into the upper-left quadrant.\n- Once we\u2019re **ahead on apples**, start actively hunting for forcing lines that lead to a **head-on where they must crash or get boxed**. With the score advantage, a double KO is then at least a draw or a win in tiebreaks.\n\nLEFT",

Clears our body drama, no enemy slams on move (his head goes nowhere near, bodies at (5,7)(5,6)), future MULTI-CHoice heaven from there \u2013 LEFT AGAIN (2,7) for open board raids, RIGHT BACK (4,7) pivot swings, DOWN (3,6) flank chases, only UP blocked by our own (3,8) end but who's gripping tails anyway? Keeps us agile, chases LEFT apples like (0,7) or (2,4) without choking on dead-ends, and boxes HIM down there \u2013 limit his RIGHT zig-zags, force him north or crash into our trails! Passive? Hell no, we're circling predators now, ready to pounce back CENTRAL if he hesitates. Angry-eyed AF, growing the gap to 3-2 easily \u2013 WATCH HIM PANIC, BOIS! If he eats any apple this turn? WE COUNTER FAST, bulk up to match or surpass, butcher his routes mercy-free.\n\nUP ROAM to (4,9) if safe? Too high, too passive, letting him munch (5,5) apple mid and bolt EAST \u2013 we lose flow, get boxed ABOVE? Not our style, chat \u2013 we're grinders, not runners!\n\nAmong safe (no self-crash, no his body/offs, no walls), LEFT coils us deeper into flank mode, maxes follow-ups (3 clear directions!), shoves closer to board edges for traps WHILE sneaking eats potential, dodges risky head-ons like the CLAUSTROPHOBIC cowards fear \u2013 score tie kills that dream, anyway! FORCE HIM into our web, grow RELENTLESS, END HIM before turn 10 \u2013 we're the aggressors, streaming to VICTORY BAYBEE! Who's next on the CHOPPING BLOCK? THIS SLIME! \ud83d\udd25\n\nQuick strategy note to FUTURE ME: Locked in at (3,7) after LEFT pivot \u2013 scout his reaction, if he goes DOWN to (4,5) or LEFT to (3,6), CHASE DOWN (3,6) immediately for side-slam pressure, steal paths NORTH to (5,5) apple and BOX from west! If up, swing RIGHT BACK (4,7) if clear to collar his head at (4,7), force U-turn dead-ends. ALWAYS SCAN MULTI-EXITS (LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT pivots), grow EVERY turn for SCORE EDGE, assassinate his growths \u2013 don't get flanked, keep mobile, double-tap traps \u2013 crush 'em ruthless! You're a BOSS, no prisons \u2013 just wins!\n\nLEFT",

No head-on collisions. RIGHT is completely safe this turn.\n\nCritically:  \n- We gain +1 apple and +1 length, so apples: 3\u20132 and length: 4\u20133 in our favor.\n\n#### If WE go DOWN \u2192 (4,4)\n\nOur body after move (no apple): (4,4),(4,5),(4,6).  \nEnemy same three options as above; none of their resulting cells (3,8/3,6/2,7 + 3,7 + 4,7) overlap with (4,4),(4,5),(4,6).  \n\u2192 DOWN is safe, but no apple, no growth.\n\n#### If WE go LEFT \u2192 (3,5)\n\nOur body after move: (3,5),(4,5),(4,6).  \nAgain, enemy positions (3,8/3,6/2,7 + 3,7 + 4,7) do not intersect our cells.  \n\u2192 LEFT is also safe, but no apple.\n\nSo we have **three safe moves**: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Strategic comparison\n\nWe\u2019re tied on apples and length right now (2\u20132, length 3\u20133). Our goals:\n- Get ahead on apples/length,\n- Control center,\n- Then leverage that to force trades or traps.\n\n**DOWN (4,4)**  \n- Safer-feeling, but purely defensive: no apple, we drift slightly away from center and from them.\n- Still leaves us with reasonable space, but doesn\u2019t pressure the opponent at all.\n- Delays the moment we can \u201cafford\u201d a head-on trade.\n\n**LEFT (3,5)**  \n- Also safe, but again no apple.\n- Pulls us slightly left and a bit closer diagonally to them, but doesn\u2019t grab any resource.\n- We\u2019d still be equal length and apples, so head-on trades are bad for us.\n\n**RIGHT (5,5) [APPLE]**  \n- Gives us:\n  - Apples: 3 (us) vs 2 (them) immediately.\n  - Length: 4 (us) vs 3 (them).\n- We\u2019re staying in the **center** of the board, which is perfect for:\n  - Pivoting toward any future apple cluster we care about,\n  - Building a thick mid-board wall they need to navigate around.\n- From (5,5) next turn, if we don\u2019t grow again, we\u2019ll have multiple viable escapes (UP, RIGHT, DOWN), and we\u2019re longer than they are.\n- With a length and apple lead, we can start to **welcome** head-on collisions later: if both snakes die together after we\u2019re ahead in apples, we win on score.\n\nSo among the three safe moves, RIGHT clearly maximizes:\n- Immediate scoring edge,\n- Future aggression potential,\n- Central board control.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what we want.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Note to future self (short plan)\n\n- Step 1 (this turn): Take RIGHT to (5,5) and secure the apple lead (3\u20132, length 4\u20133).\n- Step 2: Use our extra length to thicken a body wall across the middle (roughly x=4\u20136, y=4\u20136), forcing them to operate in tighter corridors above/left.\n- Step 3: Watch for chances to:\n  - Cut off their escape toward the center from the top,\n  - Offer \u201cbad deals\u201d where any head-on or desperate dive through us is losing for them because we\u2019re up on apples.\n- Do not over-commit into narrow channels near the edges unless it clearly sets up a box-in; our strength is in central control plus length.\n\nRIGHT",

That means later we\u2019re happy to trade in a head-on, but only when it\u2019s on *our* terms.\n\nEnemy legal moves from (2,7):\n- UP \u2192 (2,8)\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,6)\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,7)\n(RIGHT is backwards into their own neck at (3,7), so that\u2019s illegal.)\n\nOur candidate moves from (5,5):\n\n1) LEFT \u2192 (4,5)  \n   - That\u2019s our own neck, directly behind us. Moving backwards is instant death.  \n   \u2192 Discard LEFT.\n\n2) UP \u2192 (5,6)  \n   - That\u2019s currently our tail, which will move unless we grow, so it\u2019s allowed.  \n   - New body would be: [(5,6),(5,5),(4,5),(4,6)].  \n   - Check against all enemy options:\n     - Enemy UP: (2,8),(2,7),(3,7) \u2013 no overlap.\n     - Enemy DOWN: (2,6),(2,7),(3,7) \u2013 no overlap.\n     - Enemy LEFT: (1,7),(2,7),(3,7) \u2013 no overlap.  \n   \u2192 UP is safe this turn, moves us closer to them, but doesn\u2019t grab an apple or improve our space much.\n\n3) DOWN \u2192 (5,4)  \n   - New body: [(5,4),(5,5),(4,5),(4,6)].  \n   - Same enemy checks: none of their resulting cells touch ours.  \n   \u2192 DOWN is safe, keeps 3 escape directions next turn, but no apple now. We drift slightly downward away from the fight.\n\n4) RIGHT \u2192 (6,5)  \n   - New body: [(6,5),(5,5),(4,5),(4,6)].  \n   - Against all enemy moves, still no overlapping cells, no head-on collisions.  \n   \u2192 RIGHT is safe.\n\nSo we\u2019ve got **three safe options**: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, strategy time:\n- We\u2019re ahead on apples and length; that\u2019s our leverage.\n- Biggest nearby apple for us is at (6,4), with a wider juicy cluster further right and down.\n- From:\n  - DOWN to (5,4): we can go RIGHT next turn to (6,4) and eat.\n  - RIGHT to (6,5): we can go DOWN next turn to (6,4) and eat.\n  Both routes reach that apple in two moves.\n\nDifference is positioning:\n- UP pulls us toward the opponent without gaining anything immediately and can start to cramp the central band where we want space to pivot.\n- DOWN drifts us lower and slightly away from them; safe but a bit passive.\n- RIGHT keeps us in the central-right lane, preserves three strong escape options next turn, and lines us up perfectly to farm the (6,4) apple and then the entire right-side cluster while staying very safe from immediate conflict.\n\nGiven we already lead, the best \u201caggression\u201d right now is to **extend that lead** and build a big body wall from the center toward the right, so later we can bully them into bad trades or even a forced head-on when they\u2019re out of space.\n\nShort plan to future self:\n- This turn: go RIGHT to (6,5).\n- Next couple turns: prioritize the (6,4) apple, then chain into the right-side apples to grow a long, flexible body spanning mid and right lanes.\n- Keep an eye on cutting off the enemy\u2019s access to the center from above; once our lead is larger, actively look for lines where a head-on collision is available, since that wins the game immediately for us on score.\n\nRIGHT",

Meh.\n\nUP is safe but **too passive** and lets our lead evaporate if they eat.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 RIGHT \u2192 (7,5)\nCheck safety:\n- (7,5) is empty.\n- No way their head gets near (7,5) this turn. No head-on.\n- After RIGHT, we\u2019d be:\n  - Head: (7,5)\n  - Then: (6,5),(5,5),(4,5) \u2014 tail (4,6) disappears.\n- Nice central-right lane, 3 follow-ups (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) open.\n\nStrategically?\n- Keeps us central-right, good long-term map control.\n- But again: no apple now. If they go LEFT to (0,7), they tie us 3\u20133.  \nWhy let them claw back when we can slam the door shut, right? \ud83d\ude08\n\nRIGHT is safe and flexible, but doesn\u2019t press our scoreboard edge **this** turn.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 DOWN \u2192 (6,4) **(APPLE)** \ud83c\udf4e\nNow we\u2019re talking.\n\nCheck safety:\n- (6,4) currently has an apple, not a body.\n- No enemy move reaches (6,4) this turn from (1,7).\n- So no head-on, no body collision.\n\nBecause we eat, we **grow** \u2014 our tail stays put:\n- New body after DOWN:\n  - Head: (6,4)\n  - Then: (6,5),(5,5),(4,5),(4,6) \u2014 tail remains at (4,6).\n- Next turn from (6,4) we\u2019ll have **three** legal moves:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (5,4) (empty)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (7,4) (empty)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (6,3) (empty)\n  - UP is illegal (back into neck at (6,5))\n\nStrategically?\n- If they go LEFT to grab (0,7), scores become:\n  - Us: 4 apples\n  - Them: 3 apples  \n  We **keep the lead** instead of letting them tie. Huge.\n- We add another segment to keep building a big, flexible body that can later stretch across the center, cut them off, and set up a forced box or a favorable head-on.\n- We\u2019re not in a corner, not hugging a wall dangerously (y=4 is comfy), and we still have tons of space on the right and below to snake around and come back up.\n\nDOWN is:\n- Safe \u2705\n- Increases score gap \u2705\n- Increases length for future board control \u2705\n- Keeps multiple safe follow-ups \u2705\n\nWhy let them breathe when we can **grow AND stay safe**?\n\n---\n\n### Long-term plan to future self \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d\n- Take **DOWN** now to (6,4) and bank that apple for a 4\u20133 (or better) lead.\n- Next few turns:\n  - Use the lower-right apples (like (6,2), (8,2), (8,0)) **selectively** to grow, but never lock yourself into the bottom-right corner \u2014 always leave a path back up through the center.\n  - As you grow, aim to build a **wide body spanning x\u22484\u20138** across mid rows (y\u22483\u20137). That becomes a wall they struggle to cross from the left side.\n  - Keep an eye on them once they start moving off the left edge \u2014 when you\u2019re clearly ahead in apples and length, look for lines that create **forced corridors** where a head-on is either winning or at worst a draw in our favor.\n- Remember: We\u2019re not just farming apples; we\u2019re building a **cage**. Once we\u2019re long enough, start tightening the noose from the right and below, squeezing them toward the top-left until they either:\n  - crash into our body,\n  - run out of space, or\n  - are forced into a losing/drawing head-on.\n\nWe keep the pressure **by staying alive, getting bigger, and owning the map**. Time to eat and scale up. \ud83d\ude24\n\nDOWN",

We wanna **keep scaling** and set up that future box-in, yeah? \ud83d\ude08\n\nEnemy from (0,7):\n- LEFT \u2192 (-1,7) = off-board \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,7) = straight back into their neck \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (0,8) \u2705 (toward apple at (0,9))\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,6) \u2705 (toward mid-board / apple zone)\n\nSo they ONLY have **UP or DOWN**, both staying far on the left. Zero chance of a surprise collision this turn.\n\nWe check ALL our moves:\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 UP from (6,4) \u2192 (6,5)\nThat\u2019s our own neck. Instant bonk, instant L. \u274c  \nCan\u2019t ever move directly backward, chat. UP is **illegal**.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 LEFT from (6,4) \u2192 (5,4)\nWhat\u2019s on (5,4)? Empty. No enemy near. So it\u2019s **safe this turn**.\n\nNew body if we go LEFT:\n- Head: (5,4)\n- Then: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) \u2014 tail (4,6) disappears.\n\nNext turn options from (5,4):\n- UP \u2192 (5,5) = our own body \u279c suicide \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,4) = our neck \u279c illegal backward \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (4,4) = likely safe \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (5,3) = likely safe \u2705\n\nSo we\u2019d only have **two decent outs** (DOWN, LEFT), slightly reducing flexibility, and we\u2019re drifting a bit left without gaining an immediate apple or strong positional edge. Not terrible, but not optimal for long-term map control.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 DOWN from (6,4) \u2192 (6,3)\nCheck safety:\n- (6,3) is empty.\n- Enemy can only be at (0,8) or (0,6) after this turn. No collision lines. \u2705\n\nNew body:\n- Head: (6,3)\n- Then: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) \u2014 tail (4,6) disappears.\n\nNext turn from (6,3):\n- UP \u2192 (6,4) = neck \u279c illegal \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,3) = open \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,3) = open \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,2) = \ud83c\udf4e apple \u2705\n\nSo we\u2019d have **three good options**, including a path to the apple at (6,2). DOWN is **safe** and gives us a clean line to farm the lower-right apple cluster (6,2), (8,2), (8,0). But\u2026 that also pulls us further down toward the bottom edge. Do we really wanna sink that low this early and give up vertical control of the mid/top where the enemy is? \ud83e\udd14\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 RIGHT from (6,4) \u2192 (7,4)\nCheck safety:\n- (7,4) is empty right now.\n- Enemy nowhere close enough to contest it this turn. \u2705\n\nNew body:\n- Head: (7,4)\n- Then: (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) \u2014 tail (4,6) disappears.\n\nNext turn from (7,4):\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,4) = neck \u279c illegal \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (7,5) = open \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,3) = open \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,4) = \ud83c\udf4e apple \u2705\n\nSo RIGHT gives us **three strong follow-ups**, with a **direct line to apple (8,4)** and great central-right control. From there we\u2019re near:\n- (8,4), (9,4) apples on the same row\n- (7,6), (6,8), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9) cluster above\nWe stay in the **midboard**, not too low, perfectly placed to scale up and then swing left to **cut them off** later.\n\n---\n\n### Strategic vibe check \ud83d\ude0e\n\nWe\u2019re already ahead 4\u20133. Our goals:\n- Stay alive (obviously).\n- Keep our lead and extend it with **safe apples**.\n- Grow long enough to create a **huge wall** across the board that the enemy can\u2019t cross.\n- Eventually force them into:\n  - a collision with our body, or\n  - a **losing head-on** once our apple lead is big.\n\nComparing safe moves:\n- LEFT: safe but limits future options and walks us toward center-left without immediate payoff. Meh.\n- DOWN: safe, lines up apples below, but drags us toward the bottom edge, away from the enemy\u2019s vertical band and away from the huge top-right apple cluster.\n- RIGHT: safe, high flexibility, gives us fast access to **tons of apples on the right and top-right**, and keeps us in a perfect lane to later push up and then sweep left to box them in.\n\nWe\u2019re playing for **map dominance** and a big snake, not hiding in a corner. RIGHT keeps our posture aggressive and open.\n\n---\n\n### Long-term plan (note to future me \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d)\n\n- Take **RIGHT** now to (7,4) to centralize and angle toward the right-side apples.\n- Next few turns, prioritize:\n  - Grabbing (8,4) and possibly (9,4) while staying around rows y=4\u20136.\n  - Then climb up through (7,5) \u2192 (7,6) \u2192 (6,8)/(7,9)/(8,9) to farm the top-right cluster.\n- As we grow, aim to stretch a **wide body across columns ~4\u20138** around mid-to-high rows (y\u22485\u20138). That becomes a **horizontal wall** that cuts the board in half.\n- Once we\u2019re clearly longer and fatter than them, start sliding that wall **leftward**, squeezing them toward the left edge/top-left. Your body becomes a cage:\n  - deny them paths to the right,\n  - limit their escape corridors,\n  - and set up either a forced body crash or a head-on where we\u2019re ahead on apples.\n- Always leave yourself at least 2 escape routes each move; don\u2019t over-commit into the extreme corners until you\u2019re ready to fully suffocate them.\n\nTime to stake our claim on the right side and start building The Great Wall of Snake.

Time to **snowball**.\n\nEnemy first, because we don\u2019t want any surprise trades:\n- Their head: (0,6), neck: (0,7).\n  - UP \u2192 (0,7) = backwards into neck \u274c\n  - LEFT \u2192 (-1,6) = off-board \u274c\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (1,6) \u2705\n  - DOWN \u2192 (0,5) \u2705  \nThey can only go to (1,6) or (0,5). Either way, they\u2019re miles away from us. No head-on or body collision risk with them this turn.\n\nNow OUR options from head (7,4), neck (6,4):\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 LEFT \u2192 (6,4)\nNeck. Directly backwards. Instant self-bonk. \u274c  \nNot even considering it.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 UP \u2192 (7,5)\nCheck the square:\n- (7,5) is empty. Safe this turn. \u2705\n\nNew body if we go UP (no apple, so tail moves):\n- Head: (7,5)\n- Body: (7,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5)  \u2014 tail (4,5) disappears.\n\nNext turn from (7,5):\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,4) = neck \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,5) = our body \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (7,6) = apple \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,5) = empty \u2705  \n\nSo UP leaves us **2 good outs** (UP to apple, RIGHT to open space), and pushes us toward the top-side cluster. Solid, but there\u2019s a catch: we\u2019re literally sitting next to a free apple RIGHT now.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 DOWN \u2192 (7,3)\nCheck:\n- (7,3) is empty. \u2705\n\nNew body (no apple, tail moves):\n- Head: (7,3)\n- Body: (7,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) \u2014 tail (4,5) gone.\n\nNext turn from (7,3):\n- UP \u2192 (7,4) = neck \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,3) = empty \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,2) = empty \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,3) = apple \u2705  \n\nDOWN gives us **3 good outs** and a path to the lower-right apple cluster (8,3), (6,2), (8,2), (8,0). Very safe, very farmable. But it drags us **downward** toward the bottom, away from where the enemy lives and away from the massive top-right apple stack we eventually want to dominate.\n\nDo we really want to sink down when we could be building a wall above them, chat? \ud83e\udd14\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 RIGHT \u2192 (8,4) \ud83c\udf4e\nCheck:\n- (8,4) currently has an apple, no snake body. \u2705\n- Enemy is at x=0, can\u2019t even dream of reaching x=8 this turn. Zero contest.\n\nIf we go RIGHT and eat:\n- Head: (8,4)\n- Body: (7,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5) \u2014 tail **does NOT** move because we grew.\n\nScore becomes: **5\u20133**. Bigger lead, bigger body. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nNext turn from (8,4) (with this new longer body):\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,4) = neck \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (8,5) = empty \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,3) = apple below \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,4) = apple \u2705  \n\nThat\u2019s **3 juicy options**, including a direct follow-up apple at (9,4) and easy routes into the entire right/top-right apple field. We stay in the midboard (y=4), not too low, not too high, perfectly placed to:\n- Farm right-side apples safely.\n- Then climb into top-right and start building the **kill box**.\n\nCompare that to UP:\n- UP gets us positional, no immediate apple, only 2 outs.\n- RIGHT gets us **+1 apple now**, a bigger lead for future head-on trades, and still great positional flexibility.\n\nAre we really leaving a 1-step apple on the table when we\u2019re trying to bully the lobby, chat? No shot. \ud83d\ude24\n\n---\n\n### Long-term plan (note to future me \ud83e\udde0)\n\n- Take **RIGHT to (8,4)** now, grab the free apple, push score to 5\u20133 and increase length for future bullying.\n- Next turns: strongly consider chaining into **(9,4)** and then moving **UP** along the right side to farm the top-right cluster: (7,6), (6,8), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (6,9).\n- Use our growing body to form a **massive vertical + horizontal wall** on the right and high mid (cols ~6\u20139, rows ~5\u20138), then sweep that wall **leftward** to squeeze the enemy into the top-left.\n- Once we\u2019re clearly longer and up on apples, **invite** a head-on in a corridor they can\u2019t dodge, or cut off their last escape so they crash into our body.\n\nWe keep scaling, we own the right, and then we close the vise. Time to eat. \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

That\u2019s scaling, but not pressure.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 UP \u2192 (8,5)\n- (8,5) is empty. \u2705\n- No apple now, so tail moves:\n  - New body: [ (8,5), (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (6,5), (5,5) ]\n- Next turn from (8,5):\n  - UP \u2192 (8,6) \ud83c\udf4e \u2705\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (9,5) \u2705\n  - LEFT \u2192 (7,5) \u2705  \n  - DOWN is backwards \u274c  \n  \u2192 3 good outs, plus a guaranteed follow-up apple at (8,6).\n\nPositionally, this is **huge**:\n- We step **toward** the enemy\u2019s row (they\u2019re at y=6).\n- We set up to sit on row 6 with them next turn, grabbing the apple at (8,6) and then building a horizontal wall across the top-middle.\n- We still get our apple one turn later, keeping the score lead healthy.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Which play fits our *win condition*?\n\nWhat wins us the game?\n\n- Stay alive.  \n- Stay **longer and ahead on apples** so a forced head-on is in our favor.\n- Use our body as a wall to **box them in** and eventually give them no safe squares.\n\nComparing:\n\n- **RIGHT**: +1 apple now, but keeps us at y=4, drifting sideways. Great farm, less direct pressure.\n- **DOWN**: insane farming route bottom-right, but we run away from the enemy and delay our ability to box them in the upper half.\n- **UP**: immediate centralization, sets us up on **the same band (y\u22486)** as them, with an apple guaranteed next turn and lots of room to sweep left to cut them off.\n\nWe already have the lead (5\u20133). We don\u2019t **need** every single greed apple this exact move; we need to **own the important lanes**. Going UP now is how we start building the kill box across the top-middle while still scaling.\n\nSo yeah chat, we pass the instant apple to grab **position now, food next turn, pressure forever**. That\u2019s how you play to WIN, not just to farm. \ud83d\ude24\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Long-term note to future me\n\n- Take **UP** now to (8,5).\n- Next, very strongly consider taking **(8,6)** for the apple while establishing ourselves on row 6.\n- From row 6, aim to build a thick horizontal body stretching from right side inward, then pivot that wall leftward to **cut the enemy off** from the center and right.\n- Once we\u2019re clearly longer (and likely up 2\u20134 apples), start looking for forced corridors where any push they make results in:\n  - head-on we win on apples, or\n  - them slamming into our body trying to escape.\n\nUP",

Our job? Use that size to STRANGLE the top-left where they live \ud83d\udc80\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves\n\nFrom our head (8,5):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (8,6)**  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,4)**  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,5)**  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9,5)**  \n\nNow, what\u2019s instantly trolling?\n\n### DOWN \u2192 (8,4) \u274c\nThat\u2019s our own neck. Moving directly backwards = auto-throw. Not even a debate.\n\n### Board & enemy proximity\nEnemy head (1,5) can go:\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,5)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,5)\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,4)\n\nThey\u2019re locked in the 0\u20132 x, 4\u20136 y zone. We\u2019re at 7\u20139 x. No way to collide *this* turn no matter what we pick, so we just play for **position + future choke**.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Evaluate the safe moves\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 RIGHT \u2192 (9,5)\n- (9,5) is empty \u2705\n- New body: (9,5),(8,5),(8,4),(7,4),(6,4),(6,5)\n- Next turn from (9,5):\n  - UP \u2192 (9,6) \u2705\n  - DOWN \u2192 (9,4) \ud83c\udf4e \u2705\n  - LEFT is our body, RIGHT is off-board \u274c  \n- So we\u2019d have **2 outs** (UP/DOWN), hugging the right wall.\n\nThis is safe and lets us farm bottom-right later\u2026 but it drifts us **away from the center lanes** we need to control to box them in. More \u201csurvive and farm,\u201d less \u201cdominate the map.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 LEFT \u2192 (7,5)\n- (7,5) is empty \u2705  \n- New body: (7,5),(8,5),(8,4),(7,4),(6,4),(6,5)\n- Next turn from (7,5):\n  - UP \u2192 (7,6) \ud83c\udf4e \u2705\n  - DOWN \u2192 (7,4) = our body \u274c\n  - LEFT \u2192 (6,5) = our body \u274c\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (8,5) = our body (also backward) \u274c  \n\nWe\u2019d have **exactly one safe move** next turn (UP to (7,6)). Sure, that move is good and grabs an apple near center, but being **forced** is not where a big snake wants to be when our whole win condition is flexibility and map control. Why put ourselves in a mini-tunnel when we don\u2019t have to? \ud83e\udd28\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 UP \u2192 (8,6)\n- (8,6) is empty \u2705  \n- New body: (8,6),(8,5),(8,4),(7,4),(6,4),(6,5)\n- Next turn from (8,6):\n  - LEFT \u2192 (7,6) \ud83c\udf4e \u2705\n  - UP \u2192 (8,7) \u2705\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (9,6) \u2705\n  - DOWN is backwards \u274c  \n\nWe get **3 good follow-ups** and we step straight into the high-central band (y=6) where the enemy also operates. And next turn we can slide LEFT to (7,6) to:\n- Grab that apple,\n- Move closer to the enemy\u2019s side,\n- Start building a big horizontal wall across the **middle-top** of the board.\n\nThis is exactly how you start building the noose \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategic choice\n\nWhat\u2019s our mission?\n\n- Stay alive \u2705  \n- Stay longer and ahead on apples so **future head-on trades favor us** \u2705  \n- Use our body to **steal central space** and slowly seal the enemy in the corner \u2705  \n\nComparing:\n\n- **RIGHT**: Safe, gives us apples later, but drifts us away from center. Too passive.\n- **LEFT**: Advances toward center but forces us into a single-out situation next turn. Unnecessary risk.\n- **UP**: Keeps us safe *and* gives us three outs next turn *and* sets up an easy pivot onto (7,6) apple and into central control. It\u2019s the best balance of aggression and safety.\n\nSo we go **UP** now, then look to swing LEFT next turn to start drawing that big line across row 6 and cut their access to the middle of the board. We\u2019re not just playing not to lose\u2014we\u2019re setting up the choke.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc Long-term plan (note to future me)\n\n- Take **UP** now to (8,6) for max flexibility in the high-central lane.\n- Strongly consider going **LEFT to (7,6)** next to grab the apple and extend our wall toward center.\n- From there, aim to:\n  - Stretch a thick body across row 6\u20137 from right to mid-left.\n  - Deny the opponent safe exits from the top-left by occupying the central columns (x\u22484\u20137).\n  - Once we\u2019re clearly longer and ahead on apples, look for corridors where any escape path either:\n    - forces them into our body, or  \n    - sets up a head-on we **win on length/score**.\n\nUP",

Not even an option.\n\n### UP \u2192 (8,7) \u2705\n- (8,7) is empty.\n- No chance of head-on: opponent at (1,4) can only hit (1,3),(0,4),(2,4) this turn.\n- If we go UP (and don\u2019t eat), new body:\n  - (8,7),(8,6),(8,5),(8,4),(7,4),(6,4) \u2014 tail (6,5) disappears.\n- Next turn from (8,7):  \n  - UP \u2192 (8,8) (open)  \n  - LEFT \u2192 (7,7) (open)  \n  - RIGHT \u2192 (9,7) (open)  \n  - DOWN is backwards \u274c  \n  \u2192 **3 good outs**. High, flexible, safe.\n\n### LEFT \u2192 (7,6) \u2705 (APPLE \ud83d\ude0f)\n- (7,6) is an apple, no bodies there.\n- Moving LEFT is not backwards (we came from below last turn), so legal.\n- We eat, so we **grow**: tail does NOT move.\n- New body:\n  - (7,6),(8,6),(8,5),(8,4),(7,4),(6,4),(6,5) \u2014 length 7.\n- Next turn from (7,6):\n  - UP \u2192 (7,7) (open)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (7,5) (open)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (6,6) (open)\n  - RIGHT is backwards into (8,6) \u274c  \n  \u2192 Still **3 good outs**, but now we\u2019re **longer AND more central**.\n\n### RIGHT \u2192 (9,6) \u2705\n- (9,6) is empty.\n- No head-on risk from (1,4).\n- No apple, so tail moves.\n- New body:\n  - (9,6),(8,6),(8,5),(8,4),(7,4),(6,4) \u2014 tail (6,5) disappears.\n- Next turn from (9,6):\n  - UP \u2192 (9,7) (open)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (9,5) (open)\n  - LEFT is backwards, RIGHT off-board \u274c  \n  \u2192 Only **2 outs**, and we\u2019re hugging the right wall, drifting AWAY from the fight.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Factor in the enemy\n\nEnemy head at (1,4). Their legal moves:\n- UP \u2192 (1,5) = backwards into neck \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,3) \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,4) \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,4) \u2705 (and that\u2019s an apple)\n\nMost likely they go **RIGHT to (2,4)** to grab that apple and grow, pulling slightly toward midboard.\n\nWhat do we want?  \n- Stay alive (duh)  \n- Stay **bigger** so any future head-on is OUR W**  \n- Take **central space** to start **boxing them into the top-left**\n\nWhich move does that best?\n\n- **RIGHT**: safe but passive, walks us toward the wall and away from center. Meh.\n- **UP**: solid, flexible, but we **don\u2019t grow** and we delay contesting the central band where the fight will happen.\n- **LEFT**: we:\n  - Grab an apple (more length, more score, stronger future head-on),\n  - Move closer to mid (x=7),\n  - Keep 3 follow-up options,\n  - Start stretching a horizontal presence across **row 6**, right where enemy will try to cross if they move out of their corner.\n\nWhy give up a free, safe apple that ALSO advances our choke? We don\u2019t. We EAT. \ud83d\ude24\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Note to future me (next few turns plan)\n\n- Taking **LEFT to (7,6)** now is clean: safe, grows us, and pulls us toward the central lanes.\n- From (7,6), strongly consider:\n  - **LEFT to (6,6)** then **(5,6)** to grab more apples and build a fat horizontal wall on y=6,  \n  - Or **UP** to row 7 if we want to start sealing the top band.\n- Goal: use our bigger body to **span across the middle (x\u22484\u20138, y\u22486\u20137)** so their only \u201cescape\u201d paths become suicidal corridors that end in:\n  - them hitting our body, or  \n  - a head-on we win because we\u2019re up on apples and length.  \n\nKeep squeezing from the right and above; don\u2019t let them sneak into the open right half. Slowly reduce their air until every move is bad.\n\nLEFT",

Head's posted up at (2,4), eyes LOCKED on that enemy slithering at (7,6), plotting to hem 'em in and make 'em eat dirt! Apples scattered like confetti, but we're DOMINATING the board, growing long and ruthless! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc51\n\nDiving into the options from (2,4) \u2013 we gotta survive first, avoid that instant L! \ud83d\udc80 Let's dissect 'em one by one. UP to (2,5) \u2013 open space, no bodies, no edges, no apples right there but setting up for that (4,5) bounty nearby! Keepin' moves flexible, can zig zag, not boxed in yet. Good for looming and forcing a squeeze! \ud83d\ude08 DOWN to (2,3) \u2013 clear path, directly lined for (3,3) apple if we dipole charge, multiple lanes open to maneuver around the board. Solid for growth, but lotta space there \u2013 aren't we here to HUNT not hide? \ud83e\udd14 RIGHT to (3,4) \u2013 BOOM, midpoint power play! Clear zone, eyes on crowding the right side where the enemy lurks, setting traps with our tail blocking left routes. Grow on (3,3) or (4,5) soon, block 'em from apples, maybe bait a head-on when we're fatter than 30! We're AGGRESSIVE, chat \u2013 this puts us in prime position to crash that snake into submission! \ud83d\ude80 LEFT to (1,4) \u2013 haha, you SERIOUS? That's slamming face-first into OUR OWN BODY at (1,4), instant KO, don't be dumb! Eliminated, who's got time for backward stupidity? \ud83d\udeab\ud83d\udca9\n\nAmong the safe ones, RIGHT screams VICTORY \u2013 opens up paths to dominate, closer to actionable apples like (3,3), and we're pressuring that opponent without getting pinned. No head-ons risked this turn, enemy's head's far, but we're building to force 'em into walls or our expanding coil! Score gap? We're catching up, eat and grow NOW! Chat, feeling that adrenaline rush to crush 'em LIVE?! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25\n\nLONG-TERM PLOT TO MY FUTURE SELF: Ate that key apple, now RIGHT to expand into center territory, claim (3,3) next turn for 5 apples, then sweep DOWN or RIGHT toward (5,3) or loop under the board to cut off enemy space. Herd 'em toward right edge (9,0) or their body on (8,4)-(8,6), bait a collision if we're ahead. Stay ruthless, avoid dead-ends, aim for growth to 30 first \u2013 no mercy, take the win! \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\udc7e\n\nRIGHT",

Time to keep tightening the noose \ud83d\ude08  \n\nCurrent state:\n- Us: head (7,6), body [(8,6),(8,5),(8,4),(7,4),(6,4),(6,5)]\n- Them: head (2,4), body [(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(0,6)]\n\nApples near us:  \n- (5,6) \ud83d\udd25  \n- (4,5)  \n- (9,4)  \n- (3,3), (5,3), (6,2), (8,2), (8,3) etc.\n\nEnemy moves from (2,4):  \n- UP \u2192 (2,5)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,3)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,4)  \nNo way they can hit (6,6), (7,7), or (7,5) this turn, so **no head-on risk** for any of our 3 legal directions.\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from (7,6)\n\nNeighbors:\n- UP \u2192 (7,7)\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,5)\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,6)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,6) (our own neck)\n\n### RIGHT \u2192 (8,6) \u274c\nThat\u2019s straight backwards into our own body. Instant throw. Off the table.\n\n---\n\n### DOWN \u2192 (7,5) \ud83d\ude2c\n- Target (7,5) is currently empty.\n- We don\u2019t eat, so tail (6,5) disappears.\n\nNew body if we go DOWN:\n- (7,5),(7,6),(8,6),(8,5),(8,4),(7,4),(6,4)\n\nNext turn from (7,5):\n- UP \u2192 (7,6) = backwards \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,5) = our body \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,4) = our body \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,5) = only safe square (tail just vacated)\n\nSo we\u2019d **force ourselves into exactly one move** next turn. That\u2019s how you get boxed by *yourself*. Hard pass.\n\n---\n\n### UP \u2192 (7,7) \u2705 Solid but passive\n- (7,7) is empty.\n- No head-on risk; enemy can only reach (2,5),(2,3),(3,4).\n\nIf we go UP:\n- New body: (7,7),(7,6),(8,6),(8,5),(8,4),(7,4),(6,4)  \n  (tail (6,5) disappears)\n\nNext turn from (7,7):\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,6) = backwards \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (7,8) = open\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,7) = open\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,7) = open\n\nThat\u2019s **3 nice outs** into a huge open top-half plus access to the big apple cluster around row 8\u20139. Safe, flexible\u2026 but we don\u2019t grab anything *now*, and we don\u2019t immediately push our horizontal choke on the enemy.\n\n---\n\n### LEFT \u2192 (6,6) \u2705\u2705 Best play\n- (6,6) is empty.\n- No apple this step, but it aims us directly at the apple on (5,6) next turn.\n- No head-on risk.\n\nIf we go LEFT:\n- New body: (6,6),(7,6),(8,6),(8,5),(8,4),(7,4),(6,4)  \n  (tail (6,5) disappears)\n\nFrom there, next turn options (from head (6,6)):\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,6) = backwards \u274c\n- UP \u2192 (6,7) = open\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,5) = open (tail square, now empty)\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,6) = **APPLE** \u2705\n\nSo we keep **3 good outs**, including a guaranteed apple at (5,6) and an easy route to keep stretching a **horizontal wall along y=6**. That wall, combined with our blocks at (6,4),(7,4),(8,4), starts carving the board into:\n- Our domain: big right & mid stripes.\n- Their prison: left side around x\u22480\u20133.\n\nWe\u2019re already longer (7 vs 5 segments) and up 6\u20134 on apples; leaning into that by taking free, uncontested control-space is how we eventually force them into:\n- crashing into our body, OR  \n- taking a desperate head-on we win because we\u2019re bigger.\n\nUP is safe, but LEFT is both safe **and** improves our **future growth + board control**.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Quick enemy read\n\nFrom (2,4) they likely:\n- Go RIGHT to (3,4) to head toward mid + apples (3,3)/(5,3), or  \n- Go UP to (2,5) for lines on (4,5)/(5,6).\n\nEither way, by sliding LEFT to (6,6) and then likely to (5,6), we get:\n- A fat body block across the middle.\n- First claim on the central apples.  \nThey\u2019ll be trying to escape their left-side box while we\u2019re already sprawling across the middle ranks.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Note to future me (next few turns)\n\n- After **LEFT to (6,6)**, strongly favor:\n  - **LEFT to (5,6)** to grab that apple and extend the horizontal wall, then  \n  - Decide whether to push further LEFT toward center (4,6/3,6) or pivot UP to start sealing off the top corridor (6,7 \u2192 6,8 \u2192 6,9).\n- Keep the plan: use our extra length to build a **solid midline barrier** across y\u22486, then wrap from above and below to leave the opponent with only bad exits that end in:\n  - them slamming into our body, or  \n  - a head-on we win with superior length/score.\n\nLEFT",

Head locked at (3,4), eye-fucking that enemy slithering from (6,6), we've got 'em in our sights to trap 'em, crash 'em, EAT their spots on the board! Apples everywhere like easy prey, but nah, we're GROWING like a beast to control the chaos and bait that knockout! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udca5\n\nBreaking down the plays from (3,4), no funny business \u2013 must dodge death first!

Aggressive AF, but is it the slam-dunk? DOWN to (3,3) \u2013 BOOM, STRAIGHT UP POWER MOVE! Hits that juicy (3,3) apple right now, BLOWS up to 5 apples, closes the score gap like a predator closing in! Opens up routes DOWN to (3,2) or RIGHT to (4,3), no dead-ends, prime for circling back up to dominate center or chase that enemy tail. We're here to DOMINATE, not lurk \u2013 this forces us LIGHTS OUT on growth while hemming in that snake! RIGHT to (4,4) \u2013 sneaky path toward (4,5) apple vertically, shields us a bit but might box us tighter if not pivoting fast; still flexible, but DOWN screams louder victory chops! \ud83d\ude08\n\nWeighing it all \u2013 no head-ons rushed since we're still climbing, enemy's head's close but score favors us playing patiently.

Instant death. Throw. Out.\n- UP \u2192 (6,7): empty, safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,5): empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,6): apple, safe.\n\nEnemy from (3,4) can go:\n- UP \u2192 (3,5)\n- DOWN \u2192 (3,3) [apple]\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,4)\nNone of these conflict with our three safe squares, so no head-on this turn.\n\n---\n\n### DOWN (6,5)\nSafe, gives us head at (6,5) with body (6,6),(7,6),(8,6),(8,5),(8,4),(7,4). We stay length 7, apples 6. We do move a bit closer to them, but we give up a free apple and don\u2019t meaningfully increase our control; lots of lanes stay open for them to leak out under/around us. Aggressive, but inefficient.\n\n### UP (6,7)\nAlso safe, new body: (6,7),(6,6),(7,6),(8,6),(8,5),(8,4),(7,4). Good access to the juicy top apples (especially (6,8)), and 3 solid exits next turn. But we don\u2019t eat, we don\u2019t extend our central wall, and we actually leave more room for them to slip into the middle and top. That\u2019s a bit too \u201crun away and farm\u201d for the situation; we want to squeeze.\n\n### LEFT (5,6) \u2014 best play\nWe slam the apple at (5,6), grow to length 8 and apples 7\u20134:\n- New body: (5,6),(6,6),(7,6),(8,6),(8,5),(8,4),(7,4),(6,4)\n\nWhat does that do for us?\n- Creates a stronger horizontal wall at y=6 from x=5 through x=8.\n- Keeps three excellent options next turn:\n  - UP \u2192 (5,7) (open)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (5,5) (open)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (4,6) (open)\n- We stay parked right over the middle of the board while they\u2019re crammed into the lower-left.\n\nEnemy responses:\n- If they go DOWN to (3,3) for the apple, they get fatter but sink deeper into the bottom-left box; our central wall gets even more dominant.\n- If they go UP to (3,5) or RIGHT to (4,4), we\u2019re perfectly placed to keep extending the wall left or drop down to meet them and begin closing a real cage.\n\nWe get:\n- Bigger apple lead (7\u20134), so any future double-KO head-on is winning for us.\n- Superior board control: we\u2019re starting to carve the map into \u201cour giant domain\u201d vs \u201ctheir shrinking prison.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly the kind of aggressive, suffocating position we want.\n\n---\n\nPlan for the next few turns (note to future me):\n- From (5,6), strongly consider pushing LEFT to (4,6) if it keeps them boxed, or DOWN to meet them if they start approaching the gap around (4,5)/(5,5).\n- Keep growing while extending a midline barrier (y\u22486) and then start wrapping from above or below to compress their space in the bottom-left.\n- We\u2019re up on apples; if a clean head-on kill line appears later, don\u2019t be shy about taking it.\n\nLEFT",

Head smack-dab at (3,3), eyeballing that enemy squirming from (5,6), gotta amp up the aggression, grow that score, and start herding him towards a brutal smackdown once we're on top! Apples begging to be chomped, but we're focusing on BOARD CONTROL and CRASHING that foe before he snakes away \u2013 ruthless or rest in peace! \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udd25 Playbook: eat content, evade traps, stay flexible, bait that head-on when score flips! Who's hyped for the comeback? Chat, you ready to witness chaos unleashed? \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udca5\n\nLaying it out \u2013 from (3,3), no dumb moves this time: UP to (3,4)?

Solid, not flashy? Nah, it's defensive gold, but we're here to OFFEND and END him! DOWN to (3,2) \u2013 drops us south, empties out, no collisions sighted initially, could zig towards (5,2) or (6,2) apples for that quick munch, maneuvering middle-ground spots to pivot left/right later, avoids tight corners while stacking toward enemy's right flank \u2013 aggressive pivot, but is it closing the gap or just surviving? RIGHT to (4,3) \u2013 BAM, the power surge! Slides right into open turf, no blocks, eyes locked on (5,3) apple like it's prey, sets a direct bee-line to 6 apples WITHOUT boxed-in BS, keeps piles of follow-ups (up to (4,4) toward (4,5), right to victory) and hems the enemy tail routes at (6,4)-(7,4), forcing him right into walls or our turf \u2013 this is GROWTH MODE ACTIVATED, chat! Which plays the fight smarts?\n\nWeighing like a boss \u2013 gotta dodge cracks: all options avoid board death, own/enemy smash, and that backwards belly-flop fail. Now, fueling the win: we're lagging 5-7, no rushed head-ons yet (he'd flex a double KO), so GO FOR GROWTH and CLEAR SPACES! LEFT keeps escapes but drifts from juicy (5,3) and our long-game \u2013 too passive, might let him slither free up or left. DOWN jukes south, grabs potential eats at (6,2), flexible for loops, but could corner us low if enemy presses center \u2013 meh, crowd control starts here? RIGHT \u2013 HELL YEAH, the champion choice! Rockets toward (5,3) apple (one move away post-this), blows up to 6, floods options (up for (4,5), down/left for bases), dominates right lanes while cutting his play at (7,6)-(8,6), baits a future head-crasher once we're stacked 8+ \u2013 APES OUT aggression without traps! You feel that board takeover energy, gang? Time to GROW AND CONQUER OR BAIL \u2013 who's calling the shots LIVE? \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nLONG-TERM PLOT TO MY FUTURE SELF: Snagged RIGHT to (4,3) extend, now feasting eyes on RIGHT to (5,3) for sure 6 apples, U-turn LEFT or UP toward (4,5) or loop south to (3,2) chain-for more apples like (6,2)/(5,2), force enemy head at (5,6) into our tail/body pressures from left, herd him toward his own mess at (8,4-5) or walls (9,x), mount score to 10+ first (target (6,0)-(8,2) circuit), then hunt head-swap KO when ahead!

Risky when we can dominate more cleanly from above.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (4,6)**  \n  Safe: (4,6) is empty.  \n  This is the MONEY move \ud83d\udcb0\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Why LEFT is cracked here \ud83d\udca5\n\nIf we go **LEFT to (4,6)**:\n\n- Our new body becomes a **longer horizontal wall** across y=6:\n  - Head at (4,6), then (5,6),(6,6),(7,6),(8,6), then down to (8,5),(8,4),(7,4)\u2026\n- That wall at y=6 from x=4 \u2192 x=8 is **exactly** what keeps the enemy boxed in the lower-left.\n- From (4,6) next turn we have **three healthy outs**:\n  - **DOWN \u2192 (4,5)** onto an apple \ud83c\udf4e while plugging the escape gap.\n  - **LEFT \u2192 (3,6)** to extend the wall even closer over their head.\n  - **UP \u2192 (4,7)** to keep high control and pivot to the top apples if they run away.\n\nEnemy from (3,3) can go LEFT (2,3), DOWN (3,2), or RIGHT (4,3).  \nNone of those hit (4,6) this turn, so **no head-on risk now**.\n\nStrategically:\n\n- We keep them **underneath** a thick ceiling of our segments.\n- We stay in prime position to:\n  - Either **farm** apples at (4,5), then maybe (6,8), etc.\n  - Or **drop down** later to force a head-on when the line is clean \u2014 and we WIN any double-KO because of our 7\u20135 lead \ud83e\udd1c\ud83d\udca5\ud83e\udd1b\n\nUP would let them breathe.

Time to squeeze this guy.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Check all four moves from (4,6)\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,6)**  \n  That\u2019s our own neck. Instant self-KO. Auto-delete this.\n\n- **UP \u2192 (4,7)**  \n  Safe (empty).  \n  Keeps the ceiling at y=6 (4\u20138) intact via our body, but our head drifts away from the enemy and from a free apple below. Too passive, gives them more time to wriggle around under us.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,6)**  \n  Safe (empty).  \n  Extends our horizontal wall from x=3 to x=8 on y=6, tightening the \u201cceiling\u201d over them. Strong positional play, but no apple this turn and we stay three rows above their head at (4,3).\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,5)**  \n  Safe (current cell is an apple, not a body).  \n  Enemy head at (4,3) can only reach (4,4), (5,3), or (4,2) this turn, so no way for them to contest (4,5) immediately.  \n  We:\n  - Grab +1 apple (lead becomes 8\u20135).\n  - Drop directly into the lane above them, increasing pressure.\n  - Keep three healthy follow-ups for next turn: LEFT (3,5), DOWN (4,4), RIGHT (5,5).\n\nAll three of UP, LEFT, DOWN are safe this turn. By the rules, we should prefer the move that grabs apples and keeps options while leaning into aggression. That\u2019s **DOWN**.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Why DOWN is the best grind here\n\nAfter **DOWN to (4,5)** (we grow):\n\n- Our shape becomes:\n  - Head: (4,5)\n  - Body: (4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(7,6),(8,6),(8,5),(8,4),(7,4)\n- The \u201cceiling\u201d at y=6 from x=4\u21928 is still there, so they remain trapped under our mid-board wall.\n- We also now occupy (4,5), directly above their possible UP path, threatening to drop further or slide sideways to cut them off.\n\nEnemy likely play from (4,3):\n\n- **RIGHT to (5,3)** for the apple is very attractive for them and pulls them rightward under our wall.\n- **UP to (4,4)** walks straight into our shadow.\n- **DOWN to (4,2)** runs away but keeps them cramped low.\n\nFrom (4,5) next turn we\u2019ll have multiple offensive pivots regardless of their choice, and any eventual clean head-on is good for us because we\u2019re up on apples. Our move doesn\u2019t admit any response this turn where we die and they live.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Short plan for the next few turns\n\n- From **(4,5)**:\n  - If they go **RIGHT to (5,3)**, look to slide **RIGHT then DOWN** to sit over/next to them ((5,5) \u2192 (5,4)), turning our horizontal ceiling plus vertical drops into a cage.\n  - If they go **UP to (4,4)**, keep pressing above and beside them, manipulating our body so that their \u201csafe\u201d exits start to be our body segments.\n  - If they run **DOWN to (4,2)**, we control mid and farm more apples while driving a big, safe body that can later sweep down and close off lanes.\n- Always prefer lines where:\n  - Their best \u201cescape\u201d squares are our body, so their only way out is to crash into us.\n  - Any eventual head-on is forced in a way they can\u2019t dodge; with our apple lead, double-KO is a winning trade.\n\nWe stay alive, we get fatter, and we tighten the box from above and the sides until there\u2019s nowhere left for them to go.\n\nDOWN",

That means any future **double-KO is GOOD for us**. We want pressure, control, and options.\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves\n\n### \ud83d\udfe5 UP \u2192 (4,6)\n- That\u2019s literally our own neck segment.\n- Moving UP is **backwards into our body** \u2192 instant self-KO \ud83d\udc80  \n\u27a1\ufe0f UP is **illegal / suicide**. Toss it.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udfe9 LEFT \u2192 (3,5)\n- Currently empty, in-bounds, not our body. \u2705\n- Our new snake:\n  - Head (3,5)\n  - Then (4,5),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(7,6),(8,6),(8,5),(8,4) (tail at 7,4 disappears)\n- Pros:\n  - Keeps the **ceiling at y=6 from x=4\u20138** intact.\n  - Puts us a bit more left so next turn we can go **UP to (3,6)** and **extend the ceiling left**, reducing their future escape lanes.\n  - Next turn from (3,5), even after any enemy move, we basically always have **at least two safe outs**:  \n    - LEFT \u2192 (2,5)  \n    - UP \u2192 (3,6)\n- Cons:\n  - We drift slightly *away* from their head at (5,3); distance increases, pressure eases a bit.\n\nVerdict: **Solid, safe, positional**, but not max aggression.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udfe9 RIGHT \u2192 (5,5)\n- Cell (5,5) is empty. \u2705\n- New shape:\n  - Head (5,5)\n  - Body: (4,5),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(7,6),(8,6),(8,5),(8,4) (tail 7,4 disappears)\n- Now look at enemy options from (5,3): they can\u2019t go LEFT (backwards), so:\n  - DOWN \u2192 (5,2) \ud83c\udf4e\n  - UP \u2192 (5,4)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (6,3)\n- In **every** case:\n  - Our new head at (5,5) is safe this turn.\n  - Next turn we still have **multiple outs**:\n    - DOWN \u2192 (5,4) (empty regardless of whether they go DOWN or RIGHT; if they go UP it becomes their head this turn, but we move after that turn)\n    - RIGHT \u2192 (6,5) (stays open)\n  - We sit **directly above them in the same file**, distance 2\u20133 squares. Super **aggressive** posture \ud83d\ude08\n\nStrategic upside:\n- We keep the **central ceiling at y=6**.\n- We shift our head **toward the right side**, where:\n  - There\u2019s a fat apple cluster.\n  - We already have a vertical pillar at **x=8**.  \n  - We can very naturally turn this into a **right-side box**: push them right under our ceiling, then drop a vertical wall down and suffocate them against the east wall.\n- We stay close enough that if we ever line up a **forced head-on**, we\u2019re happy to take it because we\u2019re up **8\u20136**.\n\nVerdict: **Safe + aggressive + flexible.** Big fan.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udfe8 DOWN \u2192 (4,4)\n- Cell (4,4) is empty. \u2705\n- Enemy cannot reach (4,4) in one move from (5,3), so no immediate head-on.\n- After we go DOWN:\n  - Our new vertical at x=4 becomes (4,4),(4,5),(4,6).\n- But here\u2019s the catch:\n  - After they move (no matter if DOWN to 5,2, RIGHT to 6,3, or UP to 5,4), their body still solidly occupies **(3,4)** and **(4,3)**.\n  - From our new head **(4,4)**, next turn:\n    - UP \u2192 (4,5) is **backwards**.\n    - LEFT \u2192 (3,4) is enemy body \u2192 death.\n    - DOWN \u2192 (4,3) is enemy body \u2192 death.\n    - RIGHT \u2192 (5,4) is the **only reliably safe square**.\n- That means going DOWN now funnels us into a **single forced direction next turn**. That\u2019s exactly the \u201ctight corridor / low option\u201d scenario we want to avoid.\n\nVerdict: Very aggressive, but **too constricting** on our future options. Not worth the risk when we already lead.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare LEFT vs RIGHT\n\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT:\n- Are **safe this turn**.\n- Leave us with **multiple follow-up options**.\n- Keep our big mid-board wall largely intact.\n\nDifference in vibe:\n\n- **LEFT**:\n  - Slightly better for extending the ceiling to the left in future.\n  - Slightly *less* pressure on the enemy head (we move away).\n\n- **RIGHT**:\n  - Puts us **directly above** the enemy\u2019s column.\n  - Lines us up to:\n    - Drop down toward them,\n    - Or slide right into the rich apple/right-wall zone,\n    - While still keeping 2+ safe outs each turn.\n  - Much better for **forcing fights on our terms**, which we want because we\u2019re ahead.\n\nGiven we:\n- Are leading **8\u20136** \ud83d\udcaa\n- Want to **pressure** and eventually **threaten a winning head-on**,\n- And need to maintain multiple safe follow-ups,\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **RIGHT** is the move that balances safety, aggression, and long-term positional dominance.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Short-term gameplan (next few turns)\n\nFuture self, listen up \ud83d\udc47\n\n- From **(5,5)**:\n  - If enemy goes **DOWN to (5,2)** for the apple:\n    - You\u2019re towering over them at (5,5); use **DOWN or RIGHT** to stay close and keep them under your ceiling.\n  - If they go **RIGHT to (6,3)**:\n    - Consider mirroring with **RIGHT to (6,5)** next; start rotating your head toward the right wall and prepare a vertical drop to box them between your body and x=9.\n  - If they go **UP to (5,4)**:\n    - You\u2019re stacked directly above them; be willing to use **downward pressure** to threaten trades, remembering a double-KO is a WIN for us.\n- Big picture:\n  - Maintain that **ceiling at y=6** while shifting your head slightly right.\n  - Look for chances to:\n    - Herd them right under your wall,\n    - Then cut off lateral escape with a vertical column,\n    - Force them into either:\n      - Crashing into your body, or\n      - Taking a double-KO you win on apples.\n\nAlright, chat, we stay alive, we stay dominant, we keep the pressure cranked to 11 \ud83d\udd0a\n\nRIGHT",

Toss it.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udfe5 LEFT from (5,5) \u2192 (4,5)\n- (4,5) is our **neck segment**, right behind our head.\n- Moving there is **backwards into our own body**.\n\ud83d\udc49 LEFT is illegal.

Still okay, but we drop closer into their congested zone, which is risky long-term if the board starts to tighten.\n\nAggression-wise:\n- Yes, we get closer to their head/body stack.\n- But we\u2019re stepping down into the same vertical lane as their mass, which can become awkward corridors later.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udfe9 RIGHT from (5,5) \u2192 (6,5)\n\nSafety this turn:\n- (6,5) is empty.\n- Enemy from (5,2) can only go:\n  - DOWN \u2192 (5,1)\n  - LEFT \u2192 (4,2)\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (6,2) \ud83c\udf4e\n- None can reach (6,5) in one move.\n\ud83d\udc49 RIGHT is **safe this turn**.\n\nNew shape after RIGHT (tail at (8,4) disappears):\n- Head: (6,5)\n- Body: (5,5),(4,5),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6),(7,6),(8,6),(8,5)\n\nWe still have that beautiful **ceiling at y=6 from x=4\u21928**, plus a vertical column at x=6: y=5\u20136.\n\nNext turn options from (6,5):\n- UP \u2192 (6,6): our own body \u2192 death.\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,5): backwards into neck \u2192 illegal.\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,4): clear, and enemy cannot jump there from any of their options.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,5): clear, and enemy can\u2019t get there either.\n\nSo again, **2 safe follow-ups: DOWN and RIGHT**.\n\nPositionally:\n- We stay one row above their whole mess and slightly to the right.\n- If they go for the juicy apple at (6,2), we\u2019re now **directly above them on the same file** x=6.\n- That\u2019s perfect for:\n  - Keeping pressure from above,\n  - Threatening future vertical squeezes,\n  - And later swinging towards the right wall to build a giant box around them.\n\nWe also keep **more open space in front of us** (top-right and mid-right), rather than diving into the clutter near their body.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 DOWN vs RIGHT \u2014 which is better?\n\nBoth:\n- Keep us alive.\n- Leave **two** safe follow-up moves.\n\nBut:\n- **DOWN** pulls us nearer their dense body cluster and into lower-central space where the board will get cramped faster.\n- **RIGHT** keeps our dominant **ceiling** intact, maintains distance to avoid accidental self-traps, and lines us up above the right-side apple cluster and the enemy\u2019s likely path.\n\nGiven:\n- We\u2019re **ahead 8\u20137** (double-KO favors us),\n- We want **pressure with flexibility**, not panic dives into tight areas,\n- And we want to be well-placed to box them from **top + right** later,\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **RIGHT** is the stronger, more ruthless positional play.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Short-term plan (note to future self)\n\n- Keep riding that **y=6 ceiling** as your anchor of control.\n- From (6,5), consider:\n  - Sliding **RIGHT** toward the right wall and apple zones, then dropping a vertical wall down later to cage them on the bottom.\n  - Or **DOWN** if you can safely hover above wherever their head goes, always staying one move away from a favorable trade.\n- Constantly watch for a line where you can threaten a **head-on** if you\u2019re still up on apples.

That means a head-on collision right now? \ud83d\udc49 **Instant draw. Booooooring.** We want the W, not a coin flip.  \n\nLet\u2019s cook \ud83d\udd25\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves\n\n**UP** from (6,5) \u2192 (6,6)  \n- That\u2019s **our own body segment**.\n- Slam into that? \ud83d\udc80 Self-KO.\n- \u274c UP is dead.\n\n**LEFT** from (6,5) \u2192 (5,5)  \n- That\u2019s our **neck** (the segment right behind the head).\n- Moving backwards is illegal and lethal.\n- \u274c LEFT is dead.\n\nSo we\u2019re down to:\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,4)**\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7,5)**\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Is DOWN safe?\n\n**DOWN**: (6,5) \u2192 (6,4)  \n\nEnemy from (6,2) can go:\n- UP \u2192 (6,3)\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,1)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,2) for that sweet apple \ud83c\udf4e\n\nNone of those is (6,4), so:\n- \u2705 No instant body collision.\n- \u2705 No head-on this turn.\n\nAfter moving DOWN, our head is (6,4). Nearby next turn:\n- UP \u2192 (6,5): backwards into neck \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (5,4): currently open \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,3): open now, but close to their body cluster \u26a0\ufe0f\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,4): open \u2705\n\nSo DOWN keeps **multiple exits**, but it drags us **deeper toward their messy coil** in the mid-lower board. That\u2019s where things get tight and tactical real fast. Do we really want to drop into the grinder when the score is tied? \ud83e\udd14\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Is RIGHT safe?\n\n**RIGHT**: (6,5) \u2192 (7,5)\n\nEnemy from (6,2) can go:\n- UP \u2192 (6,3)\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,1)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,2) \ud83c\udf4e\n\nAgain:\n- None of those is (7,5).\n- \u2705 No instant collision, no head-on.\n\nAfter we go RIGHT, our new body still forms a **huge ceiling at y=6 from x=4\u21928**, and now:\n- New head: (7,5)\n- We\u2019ve got vertical influence down the right side of the enemy.\n\nNext turn from (7,5):\n- UP \u2192 (7,6): our own body \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,5): backwards \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,4): clear \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,5): clear (our old tail moves away) \u2705\n\nSo we get **2 clean outs**: DOWN and RIGHT.  \nPLUS we stay one row above the enemy and a bit to the right, ready to:\n- Slide to the **right wall**, then\n- Drop a vertical wall down later and\n- **Box them toward the lower-left** \ud83e\udd76\n\nAnd crucially: enemy is very likely to grab the apple at **(7,2)** next. That puts them **9\u20138 ahead**, which means:\n- Any future head-on favors **them**.\n- We *must* preserve **escape options** and **positional dominance**, not dive into their scrappy zone.\n\nRIGHT keeps us:\n- In open space \u2705  \n- Above and slightly offset from their head \u2705  \n- Well-positioned to race for **(9,4)** later and the top-right apple cluster \u2705\n\nDOWN, while safe short-term, slides us **closer to their coil** and into more future guess-wars.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term note to future self \ud83e\udde0\n\n- Enemy will almost certainly yoink \ud83c\udf4e at **(7,2)** soon \u2192 they go up **9\u20138**.\n- Our response: push **RIGHT** toward the **right edge**, then:\n  - Either snag **(9,4)** to re-tie the score,\n  - Or create a **right-side pillar** and later drop down, aiming to fence them into the lower-left/center.\n- Avoid giving them any forced head-on lines while they\u2019re ahead in apples. Always keep at least **two safe exits** from our head.\n- Maintain that **y=6 ceiling** as long as it\u2019s useful; when we\u2019re ready, rotate the body so we can transition from top control to right-side + bottom control for the box.\n\nTime to slide right and start setting the cage, chat \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc0d  \n\nRIGHT",

That\u2019s content, sure, but it\u2019s LOSING content. We\u2019re here to **win**, not just clip a flashy death.\n\nSo we snap the free apple and take the high ground.\n\n---\n\n### Note to future self \ud83c\udfa5\ud83d\udc0d\n\n- Commit to the **top-right plan**: from (8,6), prioritize going **UP toward row 9** and farming that cluster to take the score lead.\n- Maintain the **mid-board rectangle** as a hard ceiling over the enemy; avoid punching holes in it that let them escape upward for free.\n- Watch the **right-side escape lane** around x=9, y\u22644. Once we\u2019re clearly above them in both **position and apples**, look to drop a vertical wall down that side to start the box.\n- Do **not** accept a head-on unless we\u2019re clearly ahead on apples; until then, keep their head **below** our structure and outscale them from the top.\n\nUP",

Our job? **Get big, take the high ground, then slam the cage shut** \ud83d\udc80\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Evaluate all four moves\n\n### \ud83d\udd3c UP \u2192 (8,7)\n- Square (8,7) is **empty**. No apple, no bodies, clean air.\n- Our own neck is at (8,5), so this is **not** backwards. \u2705\n- Enemy head at (8,3) can move to:\n  - (8,4) UP\n  - (7,3) LEFT (apple)\n  - (9,3) RIGHT  \n  None of those hit (8,7), so **no head-on** risk this turn. \u2705\n\nAfter we move UP (and don\u2019t eat), our body becomes:\n- Head: (8,7)\n- Body: (8,6),(8,5),(7,5),(6,5),(5,5),(4,5),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6)\n\nNext-turn options from (8,7):\n- UP \u2192 (8,8) (open, near that **row 9 mega apple row** \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e)\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,7) (open)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,7) (open)\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,6) is **backwards** \u274c  \n\nSo we keep **3 good outs** and direct access to the top apple farm. That\u2019s HUGE.\n\n### \ud83d\udd3d DOWN \u2192 (8,5)\nThat\u2019s literally our own body segment directly behind the head.  \nBackwards = **instant self-kill**. \u274c\n\n### \u2b05\ufe0f LEFT \u2192 (7,6)\nAlso our body. Walk into that? We\u2019re cooked. \u274c\n\n### \u27a1\ufe0f RIGHT \u2192 (9,6)\n- (9,6) is empty \u2705\n- Enemy can\u2019t reach (9,6) this turn \u2705\n\nAfter moving RIGHT, our next-turn options from (9,6):\n- UP \u2192 (9,7) (open)\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,5) (open)\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,6) is backwards \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 off-board \u274c  \n\nSo we only get **2 outs**, and we\u2019re hugging the wall. Yeah, we can chase (9,4) or (9,9) apples later, but:\n\n- It\u2019s **slower** to reach the row-9 cluster than going straight UP now.\n- We give up central control and flexibility.\n- We still leave that juicy high ground over center more open.\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Who\u2019s winning the macro game?\n\n- Score right now: **Us 9 vs Them 11**.\n- They\u2019ve got easy apples below: (7,3), (2,3), (1,2), (4,4), (9,4).\n- We\u2019ve got the **entire TOP**:  \n  (0,9), (6,8), and the whole row-9 cluster **(6,9),(7,9),(8,9),(9,9)**.\n\nWhat wins the war?  \nWe turn ourselves into a massive **top-side boa constrictor** wrapping the board, then **drop walls down** to box them in. To do that, we:\n\n- Stay **above** them,\n- Farm **row 8\u20139** apples,\n- Avoid dumb trades while behind on apples.\n\nUP keeps us **central, flexible, and closest to the big buffet**. RIGHT sticks us to the wall with fewer options and slower scaling.\n\n---\n\n## 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term plan (note to future cracked self \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d)\n\n- From **(8,7)**, prioritize:\n  - Pushing **UP into row 8\u20139** to eat from the big apple line.\n  - Grab (8,9) / (7,9) / (6,9) / (9,9) as we weave a **thick horizontal wall** across the top.\n- Maintain a **solid mid-board ceiling** around y=5\u20136 so enemy stays trapped below.\n- Watch the **left lane** around x=0\u20133: that\u2019s their main escape channel upward.  \n  Once we\u2019re beefy from the top, drop a **vertical wall** on either the far left or right to start closing the cage.\n- Do **not** take a head-on trade until we\u2019re clearly **ahead on apples**. If we\u2019re ever up big, then yeah, we send it and ram their face for the dub \ud83d\ude08\n\nGiven all that, we take the high-ground route and keep max options.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Alright chat, back at it \u2014 turn 24, head at (8,7). Let\u2019s run the board.\n\nCurrent layout reminder:\n- Our head: (8,7)\n- Our body: (8,6),(8,5),(7,5),(6,5),(5,5),(4,5),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6)\n- Enemy head: (7,3), big chunk of body clustered around rows 2\u20134.\n- We\u2019re down on apples: us 9, them 12.\n\nWe want to stay alive, stay flexible, and grow into a massive wall that boxes them in.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Check all four moves for instant death\n\nFrom (8,7):\n\n1) UP \u2192 (8,8)\n   - Board at (8,8): apple, no bodies.\n   - In-bounds, not our own body.\n   - Enemy head at (7,3) is 6 moves away from (8,8), so no head-on collision possible this turn.\n   - Safe, and we eat an apple \u2192 grow, score to 10.\n\n2) DOWN \u2192 (8,6)\n   - That\u2019s our own body segment directly behind the head.\n   - Moving backwards is illegal and also a body collision.\n   - Immediate death. Eliminate.\n\n3) LEFT \u2192 (7,7)\n   - Currently empty, no apple, no bodies.\n   - In-bounds, not backwards, enemy cannot reach it this turn.\n   - Safe this turn.\n\n4) RIGHT \u2192 (9,7)\n   - Empty, no apple.\n   - In-bounds, not backwards, enemy can\u2019t reach.\n   - Safe this turn.\n\nSo legal/safe now: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Future safety and flexibility\n\nWe don\u2019t just want a safe move; we want a move that keeps multiple safe outs.\n\n#### If we go UP to (8,8) (and eat the apple)\n\nNew body (since we grow, tail stays at (6,6)):\n- Head: (8,8)\n- Body: (8,7),(8,6),(8,5),(7,5),(6,5),(5,5),(4,5),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6)\n\nNext-turn options from (8,8):\n- UP \u2192 (8,9) (apple, open)\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,8) (open)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,8) (open)\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,7) is backwards (our neck) and illegal\n\nSo we keep 3 solid future directions, all into a very open, low-risk top zone, plus access to a whole cluster of apples on rows 8\u20139.\n\n#### If we go LEFT to (7,7)\n\nWe don\u2019t eat, so tail advances off (6,6). New body:\n- Head: (7,7)\n- Body: (8,7),(8,6),(8,5),(7,5),(6,5),(5,5),(4,5),(4,6),(5,6)\n- Tail now at (5,6)\n\nNext-turn moves from (7,7):\n- UP \u2192 (7,8) (open)\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,7) (open)\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,6) (open)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,7) is backwards (neck), illegal\n\nAgain 3 good outs, but notice:\n- We delay grabbing the nearby apple at (8,8); it\u2019s now at least 2 moves away (7,7\u21927,8\u21928,8).\n- We\u2019re not using our current high-right position to immediately cash in on the top cluster.\n\n#### If we go RIGHT to (9,7)\n\nTail also moves, same body minus (6,6):\n- Head: (9,7)\n- Body: (8,7),(8,6),(8,5),(7,5),(6,5),(5,5),(4,5),(4,6),(5,6)\n\nNext-turn options from (9,7):\n- UP \u2192 (9,8) (open)\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,6) (open)\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,7) backwards, illegal\n- RIGHT \u2192 off-board, illegal\n\nSo only 2 future outs, and we\u2019re hugging the right wall. That\u2019s less flexible and easier to get squeezed later.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Strategic context: how do we box this guy?\n\nEnemy is low and central:\n- Head at (7,3), body spread across rows 2\u20134.\n- Reasonable, safe moves for them this turn are most likely UP to (7,4) or LEFT to (6,3); both keep them below our current \u201cceiling\u201d around y=5\u20136.\n\nOur shape right now:\n- Massive horizontal wall on y=5 from x=4\u20138.\n- Extra bulk on y=6 at x=4\u20136 and x=8.\n- We already control the mid-board; top is basically free real estate.\n\nWhat do we want?\n- Inflate ourselves on the top half (rows 7\u20139).\n- Turn that into a fat horizontal band that can eventually drop vertical walls to trap them underneath.\n- We\u2019re behind 3 apples, so we do not want an early head-on trade; we want to out-grow them first, then threaten collisions.\n\nGoing UP right now:\n- Immediately grabs (8,8).\n- Sets up easy follow-ups to row 9: (8,9), then we can swing to (7,9) or (9,9).\n- Uses our current high-right position to vacuum the strongest apple cluster on the board.\n- Keeps 3 exits and stays far from any forced interaction.\n\nGoing LEFT:\n- Also safe and flexible, but it slows our growth and delays our top control for no real defensive benefit right now.\n\nGoing RIGHT:\n- Reduces options to 2, sticks us to a wall, and doesn\u2019t give us an apple this turn. Worst of the three.\n\nGiven the plan to become a gigantic top-side barrier and then drop down to suffocate the enemy, the best move is to push further into the top apple field and grow.\n\n---\n\n### Short plan to future me\n\n- Keep climbing into the top: after (8,8), strongly consider taking (8,9) and then sweeping horizontally along row 9.\n- Use that extra length to form a continuous \u201croof\u201d above y=5\u20136, avoiding tight self-loops.\n- Watch for when the enemy starts poking above y=4; we want to be in position to threaten cutting off their escape lanes through the center and right, while leaving ourselves at least two exits at all times.\n- Do not seek head-on contact until we\u2019ve closed the apple gap or taken the lead; prioritize safe growth and board domination first.\n\nUP",

Enemy is stuck in the basement. Our job now? Get huge on the top half, then crush down later.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Check all four moves from (8,8)\n\n- **UP \u2192 (8,9)**  \n  - In bounds.  \n  - Cell (8,9) has an apple, no bodies.  \n  - Enemy can\u2019t get anywhere near that square this turn.  \n  - We eat, grow, score goes to 11, tail stays at (6,6). **Safe.**\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,7)**  \n  - That\u2019s our own neck. Backwards = instant self-KO. **Illegal/dead.**\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,8)**  \n  - Cell is empty.  \n  - Not our own body, not off-board.  \n  - Enemy head at (7,4) is 4 rows below; can\u2019t reach.  \n  - Tail moves off (6,6), but we\u2019re not stepping into it anyway. **Safe.**\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9,8)**  \n  - Cell is empty.  \n  - Not off-board, not backwards.  \n  - Enemy too far.  \n  - Tail moves from (6,6), irrelevant to that square. **Safe.**\n\nSo three usable moves: **UP, LEFT, RIGHT**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Future flexibility and apple tempo\n\n#### If we go **UP** to (8,9)\n\nNew body (we grow, tail stays at (6,6)):\n\nHead:  \n- (8,9)\n\nBody:  \n- (8,8),(8,7),(8,6),(8,5),(7,5),(6,5),(5,5),(4,5),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6)\n\nNext turn from (8,9):\n\n- UP \u2192 (8,10) off-board (illegal)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,8) is backwards (illegal)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,9) \u2014 **apple, open**  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,9) \u2014 **apple, open**\n\nSo we keep **2** safe, apple-rich options next turn. That\u2019s multiple outs, and both are huge value.\n\nApple tempo:\n- Turn 25: UP \u2192 (8,9) \u2192 +1 apple, us to 11.\n- Turn 26: likely LEFT or RIGHT \u2192 another apple, to 12.\n\nWe can realistically grab **2 apples in 2 turns** while enemy is still maneuvering just to *reach* one.\n\n#### If we go **LEFT** to (7,8)\n\nWe don\u2019t eat; tail moves off (6,6):\n\nHead:  \n- (7,8)\n\nBody:  \n- (8,8),(8,7),(8,6),(8,5),(7,5),(6,5),(5,5),(4,5),(4,6),(5,6)\n\nNext turn from (7,8):\n\n- UP \u2192 (7,9) \u2014 apple  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,8) \u2014 apple  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,7) \u2014 empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,8) backwards (illegal)\n\nSo **3** safe directions, nice flexibility, good apples \u2014 but:\n\nApple tempo:\n- Turn 25: 0 apples (still at 10)\n- Turn 26: +1 apple (to 11)\n\nIn the same 2-turn window as UP\u2192UP/side, **we get only 1 instead of 2**. That matters when we\u2019re trailing.\n\n#### If we go **RIGHT** to (9,8)\n\nTail moves:\n\nHead:  \n- (9,8)\n\nBody:  \n- (8,8),(8,7),(8,6),(8,5),(7,5),(6,5),(5,5),(4,5),(4,6),(5,6)\n\nNext turn from (9,8):\n\n- UP \u2192 (9,9) \u2014 apple  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,7) \u2014 empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,8) backwards (illegal)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off-board\n\nSo only **2** outs, 1 apple accessible next turn. Worse tempo than the UP line (still max +1 apple over 2 turns).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Enemy behavior and boxing strategy\n\nEnemy head at (7,4):\n\n- UP \u2192 (7,5) is our body \u21d2 they die if they do that.\n- DOWN \u2192 (7,3) is backwards \u21d2 illegal.\n- LEFT \u2192 (6,4) empty, no apple.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,4) empty, no apple.\n\nSo they\u2019re almost certainly going **LEFT or RIGHT**, staying under our wall. Either way, they\u2019re multiple moves away from any top-half apples.\n\nOur macro-plan:\n\n- **We are the roof.** Our body already forms a nasty mid-board barrier around y=5\u20136.\n- Enemy is trapped under that roof; only real escape is eventually sliding far left (x0\u20133) and then coming up.\n- We want to **inflate massive size in the top half** (rows 7\u20139), building a thick band of our body so that when we decide to push down, we can:\n  - Keep at least two escape routes for ourselves, and  \n  - Cut off their routes and threaten lethal head collisions **once we\u2019re ahead in apples**.\n\nGoing **UP now**:\n- Immediately exploits the huge apple cluster on row 9.  \n- Narrows the score gap fast \u2014 we can probably go from 10\u219212 before they hit 13.  \n- Keeps us safely far above them, zero head-on risk in the short term.  \n- Leaves our mid-wall fully intact because we keep growing, so the tail doesn\u2019t retract that defense.\n\nGoing **LEFT/RIGHT now**:\n- Still safe, but strictly slower at catching up in apples.  \n- Gives the enemy relatively more time to stabilize below before we\u2019re big enough to dominate.\n\nWe want to be the bigger snake before we start forcing those spicy head-on lines. The fastest, still-safe route to that is **UP into the apple patch**.\n\n---\n\n### Short plan to future me\n\n- Keep farming the top: after **UP to (8,9)**, strongly consider taking another top apple (LEFT to (7,9) or RIGHT to (9,9)) to hit 12 apples quickly.\n- Maintain the mid-board wall by continuing to eat so the tail doesn\u2019t peel back; that keeps the enemy sealed under y\u22485\u20136.\n- Watch the left gap at x0\u20133 on row 5; if they start drifting that way, be ready to slide part of our top mass left and eventually drop a vertical column to close the escape.\n- Once we\u2019re **ahead** on apples, start steering our head paths to create credible head-on threats through the central lanes, where they\u2019re forced to respect our body.\n\nUP",

Our legal moves from (8,9)\n\nHead: (8,9)  \nBody (no head): (8,8),(8,7),(8,6),(8,5),(7,5),(6,5),(5,5),(4,5),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6)  \nTail: (6,6)\n\nCheck all four:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (8,10)**  \n  - y=10 is off the 0\u20139 board. Instant death. Eliminated.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (8,8)**  \n  - That\u2019s our own neck, directly backwards. Illegal/self-KO. Eliminated.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (7,9)**  \n  - In-bounds, currently an apple.  \n  - Not our body, not enemy body.  \n  - Safe this turn.\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (9,9)**  \n  - In-bounds, also an apple.  \n  - Not our body, not enemy body.  \n  - Safe this turn.\n\nSo it\u2019s **between LEFT and RIGHT**, both eating an apple.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy\u2019s situation\n\nEnemy head: (8,4)  \nEnemy body: (..., tail at (2,4))\n\nFrom (8,4):\n\n- UP \u2192 (8,5) = our body \u21d2 they die if they do that.\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,3) = their own body/backwards \u21d2 illegal.\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,4) = their own body/backwards \u21d2 illegal.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,4) = apple, open.\n\nSo the **only sane, legal move** for them is **RIGHT to (9,4)**, grabbing an apple. They\u2019ll go from 12 \u2192 13 apples. They are still far below us; no head-on risk with our top moves this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 3. If we go LEFT to (7,9)\n\nWe eat the apple at (7,9). Because we eat, our tail at (6,6) does **not** move this turn.\n\nNew snake after move:\n\n- Head: (7,9)\n- Body: (8,9),(8,8),(8,7),(8,6),(8,5),(7,5),(6,5),(5,5),(4,5),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6)\n\nNext turn options from (7,9):\n\n- UP \u2192 (7,10) off-board (bad).\n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,9) backwards into our body (illegal).\n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,9)**  \n  - In-bounds, currently an apple, and nobody else near enough to contest.  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,8)**  \n  - In-bounds, currently empty.\n\nSo from LEFT we keep **two safe directions** next turn (LEFT to more food, DOWN to space), and we stay more central, keeping lanes open to the midboard for later pressure.\n\n---\n\n### 4. If we go RIGHT to (9,9)\n\nWe eat the apple at (9,9). Tail stays at (6,6).\n\nNew snake:\n\n- Head: (9,9)\n- Body: (8,9),(8,8),(8,7),(8,6),(8,5),(7,5),(6,5),(5,5),(4,5),(4,6),(5,6),(6,6)\n\nNext turn options from (9,9):\n\n- UP \u2192 (9,10) off-board.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (10,9) off-board.\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,9) backwards into our body (illegal).\n- **DOWN \u2192 (9,8)** only safe move.\n\nSo going RIGHT boxes us into **exactly one escape square** on the next turn. That\u2019s how you slowly trap yourself in the corner.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Strategy implications\n\n- Score after this turn if both play sensibly:\n  - Enemy: 12 \u2192 13 (RIGHT to (9,4))\n  - Us: 11 \u2192 12 (either LEFT or RIGHT)\n  - We stay **one apple behind** but:\n    - We have access to a dense apple cluster on the top side.\n    - Enemy is still sealed under our mid-board wall (our y=5\u20136 band doesn\u2019t weaken because our tail stays put while we keep eating).\n\n- **LEFT**:\n  - Keeps more future options (2 safe moves vs 1).\n  - Maintains strong top-right presence but with more central positioning.\n  - Sets us up to chain another apple at (6,9) while still having a downward escape.\n\n- **RIGHT**:\n  - Same immediate gain, worse flexibility next turn, more cornered.\n\nGiven we\u2019re aiming to grow big, keep the roof solid, then eventually drop down and suffocate them, we absolutely want the move that preserves options and central control.\n\n---\n\n### Note to future self (next few turns)\n\n- Prioritize farming the top apple cluster while keeping **at least two safe exits** from the top edge whenever possible.\n- Keep eating so the tail doesn\u2019t retract your mid-board wall; that ceiling over y=4\u20135 is your main leverage.\n- Watch for the enemy drifting far left under the wall; if they start escaping via x0\u20133, plan a controlled slide left on the top and then a vertical drop to close that corridor.\n- Once we\u2019re ahead in apples and still much larger, start plotting routes where they\u2019re forced toward potential head-on lines against our bigger snake.\n\nLEFT",

Let\u2019s dissect it \ud83d\udc47\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Our legal moves from (7,9)\n\nCheck all four:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (7,10)**  \n  Off the board. Instant L \u274c\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,9)**  \n  That\u2019s our own neck, directly backwards. Illegal / self-KO \u274c\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,8)**  \n  In-bounds, empty, not our body, not enemy. Safe \u2705\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,9)**  \n  In-bounds, it\u2019s an **apple** \ud83c\udf4e, not occupied. Safe \u2705\n\nSo it\u2019s a **2-move decision**: **DOWN vs LEFT**.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What can the enemy do?\n\nEnemy head: **(9,4)**  \nPossible moves:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (9,5)** \u2013 in bounds, empty, not backwards, safe \u2705  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (9,3)** \u2013 in bounds, empty, not backwards, safe \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,4) is backwards into neck \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (10,4) off-board \u274c  \n\nSo they\u2019re choosing between **UP (9,5)** or **DOWN (9,3)**.  \nEither way, they stay **far away** from our potential squares (6,9) and (7,8). No head-on danger this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 If we go LEFT \u2192 (6,9)\n\nWe chomp the apple at (6,9) \ud83c\udf4e\n\n- **We grow** \u2192 tail at (6,6) does **NOT** move.  \n- Our new body:\n\n  - Head: (6,9)  \n  - Then: (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6)\n\n- That **horizontal wall at y=5\u20136 from x=4\u20138 stays rock solid** \ud83d\udcaa  \n  This is our ceiling that keeps the opponent trapped underneath.\n\nNext turn options from new head (6,9):\n\n- UP \u2192 (6,10) = death \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,9) = backwards \u274c  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,9)** = safe \u2705  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,8)** = also an apple, safe \u2705\n\nSo after going LEFT, we still have **two good outs** and we\u2019ve:\n- Tied the score **13\u201313**  \n- Maintained maximum board control with the wall intact\n\nThat\u2019s how you strangle the map while keeping options open \ud83d\ude0f\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 If we go DOWN \u2192 (7,8)\n\nWe drop to (7,8), no apple.\n\n- We **don\u2019t grow**, so our tail at (6,6) moves up and disappears.\n- New tail becomes (5,6).  \n  So (6,6) becomes **empty**, creating a gap in our second row.\n\nResult:  \n- Wall at **y=5** is still solid, but **y=6** now has a new hole at (6,6) (and already open at (7,6)).  \n- That slowly loosens the clamp on the opponent.\n\nNext turn options from (7,8):\n\n- UP \u2192 (7,9) backwards \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,8) into our body \u274c  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,8)** apple \u2705  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,7)** empty \u2705  \n\nStill 2 options, but:\n- We **stay behind** in score: 12 vs 13  \n- Our long-term **box-in structure gets weaker** as the tail recedes\n\nWhy give him more room when we can keep the cage tight AND tie the score? \ud83e\udd28\n\n---\n\n### 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategic verdict\n\nWe want to:\n\n- Grow big \ud83d\ude24  \n- Keep that **mid-board ceiling** unbroken as long as possible  \n- Avoid any double-KO while we\u2019re behind in apples  \n- Eventually force him into a corridor where a head-on or body-crash is **our** win condition\n\n**LEFT**:\n- Gains an apple \u2192 **ties the score 13\u201313**\n- Keeps our wall fully intact\n- Leaves us multiple safe follow-ups (DOWN to another apple or further LEFT for space)\n- Continues to dominate the top and midboard\n\n**DOWN**:\n- No apple, still behind\n- Slowly erodes our wall structure and gives him more potential escape routes later\n\nWhy give him breathing room when we can just tighten the noose AND get fed? \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc0d\n\n---\n\n### Note to future self \ud83c\udfa5\n\n- Keep **farming the top apples** (6,8), (5,8), (0,9), (9,9) while preserving that y=5\u20136 wall as long as possible.  \n- Watch if he goes **UP to (9,5)** \u2013 if he starts climbing the right side, look to slide our head toward the right edge later to cut off the column 9 escape and box him between our body and the wall.  \n- Only start dropping down through our own wall once:\n  - We\u2019re **ahead in apples**, and  \n  - We can descend in a way that **doesn\u2019t** open a clean vertical escape lane for him.  \n- Remember: once we\u2019re ahead, forcing a head-on in a cramped corridor is **good for us**. For now, just grow and tighten the cage.\n\nLEFT",

That pillar is EVERYTHING right now.\n- Enemy head: **(9,5)**, right under our pillar, about to get funneled into the corner.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all our moves from (6,9)\n\n- **UP \u2192 (6,10)**  \n  Off the board \u2192 instant throw \u274c\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7,9)**  \n  That\u2019s our own neck (backwards) \u2192 illegal / death \u274c\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,9)**  \n  In-bounds, empty, no body there \u2192 **safe** \u2705\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,8)**  \n  In-bounds, it\u2019s an **apple** \ud83c\udf4e, not occupied \u2192 **safe + growth** \u2705\n\nSo it\u2019s **LEFT vs DOWN** again.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What can the enemy do from (9,5)?\n\nEnemy head at **(9,5)** with neck at **(9,4)**:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (9,6)**: in-bounds, empty \u2192 safe \u2705  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (9,4)**: backwards into own neck \u2192 illegal \u274c  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (8,5)**: that\u2019s **our body**, so if he does this, he **dies** into us \u2192 suicidal \u274c (for any sane snake)  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (10,5)**: off-board \u274c  \n\nSo realistically, he\u2019s going **UP to (9,6)**, then will be forced to keep climbing the **right edge corridor**:  \n(9,6) \u2192 (9,7) \u2192 (9,8) \u2192 (9,9).  \nAll the while, our pillar at **x = 8** is boxing him in on his left. Nasty, right? \ud83d\ude08\n\nCrucial: whether we go LEFT or DOWN, there is **no head-on** with him this turn; we\u2019re too far away.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Option A: LEFT \u2192 (5,9)\n\nNo apple, so we **don\u2019t grow**:\n\n- New head: (5,9)  \n- Tail moves forward, we lose segment at **(6,6)**.\n- Our band at **y=5** is still solid at x=4\u20138.  \n- Our band at **y=6** becomes a bit weaker (only at x=4,5,8).\n\nNext turn from **(5,9)**:\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (5,8)** (apple) \u2705  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (4,9)** (empty) \u2705  \n- RIGHT is backwards, UP is off-board.\n\nSo we have **2 outs**, and we stay **tied** on apples (13\u201313).  \nWe also **slightly open up our structure** by letting (6,6) go empty. Why loosen the cage when we don\u2019t have to?\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Option B: DOWN \u2192 (6,8) \ud83c\udf4e\n\nWe chomp the apple at **(6,8)**:\n\n- New head: **(6,8)**  \n- We **grow**, so tail at **(6,6)** does **NOT** move.  \n- Our vertical pillar at **x=8 (8,5\u20138,9)** stays fully intact.  \n- Our double-row wall at **y=5 & y=6** stays chunky.\n\nNow the score goes to **14 (us) vs 13 (him)**. We take the lead \ud83d\ude08\n\nNext turn from **(6,8)**:\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (5,8)**: apple \u2705  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (7,8)**: apple \u2705  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (6,7)**: empty, safe \u2705  \n- UP is backwards.\n\nSo from (6,8) we actually have **three good forward moves** and a nice clump of apples we can farm while our body **continues to seal the mid and right**.\n\nMeanwhile, enemy is almost forced up that **right-edge prison**:\n- (9,5) \u2192 (9,6) \u2192 (9,7) \u2192 (9,8) \u2192 (9,9 A)\n\nWe keep the **x=8 pillar** glued in place while he crawls into the top-right corner. Once we\u2019re a few apples ahead, we can happily force a head-on or just let him run out of space and faceplant into us. Content either way. \ud83e\uddf1\ud83d\udc0d\n\n---\n\n### 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Which is better?\n\nAsk yourself, chat:\n\n- Do we want **more length**, more apples, and **more future options**?  \n- Do we want to keep the **right-side cage** perfectly intact while he walks into it?  \n- Do we want to grab the lead so a future head-on is **good for us**?\n\nThat\u2019s all **DOWN to (6,8)**.  \nLEFT is safe but passive; DOWN is safe, **aggressive**, and keeps the box-in plan pristine.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Plan for future me\n\n- Keep eating through the **row-8 apple cluster**: (5,8), (7,8), maybe later (1,8), (0,9), (9,9) if they don\u2019t get it first.  \n- **Maintain the x=8 pillar** as long as possible; that\u2019s our cage wall locking him into the right edge. Avoid moves that prematurely free (8,6\u20138,8).  \n- Watch his forced climb: once he\u2019s around (9,8)/(9,9), look for lines that either:\n  - Box him completely in the top-right so he crashes into us, or  \n  - Set up a **favorable head-on** once we\u2019re firmly ahead in apples.  \n- Never let him slip left past our wall\u2014if we ever open a gap near x=8/y\u22656, it should be on OUR terms with a clear kill path.\n\nDOWN",

He\u2019s basically climbing the right-edge prison we built for him.\n\nNo matter what WE pick this turn, there is **no possible head-on** with him right now (his reachable squares are (9,7) or suicide into (8,6)). So we just pick the move that gives us the best future leverage.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Evaluate each of OUR options with future safety\n\n#### \ud83d\udeab RIGHT \u2192 (7,8) (no apple)\n\nWe need to be ruthless about **future outs**.\n\nAfter RIGHT:\n- New head: **(7,8)**  \n- We **don\u2019t grow**, so tail at **(6,6)** moves up one.\n- Our pillar at x=8 stays intact (still good).\n\nBut from **(7,8)** next turn:\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (6,8)**: backwards into our neck \u274c  \n- **UP \u2192 (7,9)**: our own body \u274c  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (8,8)**: our own body \u274c  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (7,7)**: empty \u2705\n\nSo from 7,8 we have **only ONE safe move** next turn (DOWN). That\u2019s a future choke on **US**, not him. Why tunnel ourselves when we\u2019re the one ahead? \ud83e\udd28\n\n\ud83d\udc49 RIGHT is technically safe now but strategically TERRIBLE. Toss it.\n\n---\n\nNow it\u2019s **LEFT vs DOWN**, both apples, both safe.\n\n#### \ud83c\udf4e DOWN \u2192 (6,7)\n\n- We eat the apple at (6,7).  \n- New head: **(6,7)**, we **grow**, tail at **(6,6)** stays in place.\n- Our wall and x=8 pillar stay rock solid.\n\nNext turn from **(6,7)**:\n\n- Neck = (6,8), so:\n  - **UP \u2192 (6,8)**: backwards \u274c  \n  - **DOWN \u2192 (6,6)**: our body \u274c  \n  - **LEFT \u2192 (5,7)**: empty \u2705  \n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (7,7)**: empty \u2705  \n\nSo we\u2019d have **2 safe outs** next turn (LEFT/RIGHT). Fine, not bad.\n\nApple-wise:\n- We grab **(6,7)** now.  \n- The apple at **(5,8)** is still there but will take extra moves to loop back to.\n\nPosition-wise:\n- We drop one row closer to the middle band.\n- Still keep enemy caged on the right with our pillar.\n\n#### \ud83c\udf4e LEFT \u2192 (5,8)\n\n- We eat the apple at (5,8).  \n- New head: **(5,8)**, we **grow**, tail at **(6,6)** stays.\n- Pillar at x=8 unchanged and chunky (8,5\u20139 all ours).\n\nNext turn from **(5,8)**:\n\n- Neck = (6,8), so:\n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (6,8)**: backwards \u274c  \n  - **UP \u2192 (5,9)**: empty \u2705  \n  - **LEFT \u2192 (4,8)**: empty \u2705  \n  - **DOWN \u2192 (5,7)**: empty \u2705  \n\nSo from 5,8 we have **THREE safe outs** (UP, LEFT, DOWN). WAY more flexible.\n\nApple-wise:\n- We grab **(5,8)** now.  \n- The apple at **(6,7)** is STILL safe and basically reserved for us later; enemy can\u2019t reach it through our wall.\n\nPosition-wise:\n- We\u2019re pushing **left into open space**, away from the claustrophobic right edge.  \n- We still fully wall the enemy off with our x=8 pillar and y=5\u20136 band.  \n- We\u2019re closer to more juicy apples on the left/top: **(1,8)**, **(0,9)**, **(2,7)**, etc.\n\nBetween the two?\n\n- Both moves: give us +1 apple \u2192 scoreboard becomes **15 vs 13**.  \n- BUT:\n  - **DOWN** gives us **2 future outs**.  \n  - **LEFT** gives us **3 future outs** and better control of the wide open left/top side.\n\nWhy take fewer options when we\u2019re trying to slowly STRANGLE this guy with board control? \ud83d\ude0f\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Enemy future if we go LEFT\n\nWe go **LEFT to (5,8)**, he goes **UP to (9,7)**:\n\n- After this turn:\n  - Our score: **15**  \n  - His score: **13**  \n- Next turn, he\u2019s almost **forced** to go:\n  - (9,7) \u2192 (9,8) \u2192 (9,9 A)  \n- We keep the **x=8 wall** intact, so his only life-line is that skinny vertical corridor at x=9.\n\nSo what\u2019s the macro picture?\n\n- He\u2019s crawling up a 1-wide hallway on the right.\n- We\u2019re a fat monster snake owning top and left, with more mobility AND more apples.\n- This is the dream setup to:\n  - Either line up a **favorable head-on** later when we\u2019re far ahead, or  \n  - Just let him run out of safe moves and slam into our wall.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Long-term plan for future-me\n\n1. **Take LEFT now** to 5,8 and lock in the 2-point lead.  \n2. From 5,8, keep:\n   - At least **2\u20133 safe outs** each turn,  \n   - Expanding **left and up**, grabbing apples like **(1,8)**, **(0,9)**, and maybe swing back for **(6,7)** when it\u2019s convenient.  \n3. **DO NOT** casually break the x=8 pillar or the y=5\u20136 wall on the right; that\u2019s the cage keeping him in that x=9 tunnel.  \n4. Watch his climb: as he approaches **(9,8)** and **(9,9)**, start thinking about:\n   - Sealing the top so his only options lead to our body, or  \n   - Setting up a kill trade where a double-head collision happens while we\u2019re **comfortably ahead** on apples.  \n5. Always avoid putting our own head in tight 1-wide loops unless it\u2019s part of a deliberate kill setup. We want HIM to be the one with no outs.\n\nAlright chat\u2026 we\u2019re farming AND caging at the same time. We take the apple, we keep the prison. Easy choice.\n\nLEFT",

Priority now is **not** to squeeze ourselves\u2014it's to stay flexible and let him cook himself later.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **LEFT is the best mix of safety, future options, and long-term dominance.**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccb Short Plan for Future Me\n\n1. **Go LEFT now** to **(4,8)** to keep 3 future outs.\n2. Use the next few turns to:\n   - Sweep toward **(1,8)** and **(0,9)** for safe apples in open space.\n   - Keep our **x=8 pillar** and **y=5 wall** mostly intact; avoid moves that cause our tail to vacate too many of those without grabbing apples.\n3. When tail starts approaching row 5/column 8, dip back for nearby apples like **(6,7)** or **(4,4)** to slow tail movement and keep the cage strong.\n4. Watch their attempt to slip **under** our wall around y\u22644; if they head down, mirror down on the left side to build a second horizontal wall and shrink their playground.\n5. If we get a big apple lead (3\u20134+), start looking for calculated setups that could force a favorable head-on when they\u2019re cornered.\n\nLEFT",

Our only job: pick the one that doesn\u2019t lock us later and keeps control.\n\nAlso note: we do **not** eat an apple on any of these moves this turn, so our tail at **(5,6)** will move up to **(4,6)**, and cell **(5,6)** becomes free.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Step 3: Evaluate each safe move\n\n#### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 UP \u2192 (4,9)\n\nNew head: **(4,9)**  \nTail moves from **(5,6)** \u2192 gone; new tail **(4,6)**.  \nWe still keep the **y=5 wall** and the **x=8 pillar** intact, including **(8,9)**, so enemy remains doomed.\n\nFrom **(4,9)** next turn:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (4,10)**: off-board \u274c\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,8)**: backwards \u274c\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,9)**: empty \u2705\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,9)**: empty \u2705\n\nSo we\u2019d have **2 safe options** next turn. Not bad, but hugging the top edge shrinks our maneuver room a bit.\n\n#### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 DOWN \u2192 (4,7)\n\nNew head: **(4,7)**  \nTail: still ends up at **(4,6)**, wall at y=5 stays solid, pillar at x=8 stays solid.\n\nFrom **(4,7)** next turn (ignoring apples for safety):\n\n- **UP \u2192 (4,8)**: backwards \u274c\n- **LEFT \u2192 (3,7)**: empty \u2705\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (5,7)**: empty \u2705\n- **DOWN \u2192 (4,6)**: likely safe but depends on tail timing; we don\u2019t want to rely on that in tight spots\n\nEffectively **2 clearly safe outs** (LEFT/RIGHT). Fine, but not maximal flexibility.\n\n#### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 LEFT \u2192 (3,8)\n\nNew head: **(3,8)**  \nTail: **(4,6)**, wall and pillar still rock solid, including **(8,9)**. Enemy coffin remains nailed shut. \ud83e\udea6\n\nFrom **(3,8)** next turn:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (3,9)**: empty \u2705\n- **DOWN \u2192 (3,7)**: empty \u2705\n- **LEFT \u2192 (2,8)**: empty \u2705\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (4,8)**: backwards \u274c\n\nThat gives us **3 clean, safe options**. Maximum freedom, away from edges, still maintaining the entire cage structure.\n\nSo which do we want when our opponent is already doomed next turn?  \nThe one that:\n\n- Keeps us **safest** (most future outs \u2705)\n- Keeps the cage intact \u2705\n- Doesn\u2019t hug a border unnecessarily \u2705\n\nThat\u2019s **LEFT to (3,8)**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Mini-plan for future me\n\n- This turn: **go LEFT to (3,8)** to keep **three** future escape routes and maintain the right-side prison.\n- Next turn, while they\u2019re forced into a no-move death from **(9,9)**, we just keep playing safe, using our huge space on the left/top.\n- Don\u2019t do anything fancy or greedy \u2014 enemy is **literally checkmated**; our only way to throw is self-destructing before they die.\n- After they die (Turn 32), game ends with us alive and ahead on apples.

We\u2019re ahead. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nFrom enemy head **(9,9)**:\n- **UP \u2192 (9,10)** \u274c off-board  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (10,9)** \u274c off-board  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (9,8)** \u274c straight backwards into their neck (self-kill)  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (8,9)** \u274c that\u2019s OUR body, not our tail, so it stays occupied and they die on impact  \n\nThey literally have **no safe square**. Whatever they input, they die THIS TURN. They\u2019re checkmated in our wall. \ud83e\uddf1\n\nAs long as we don\u2019t grief ourselves, we win immediately when they explode.\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Our move options from (3,8)\n\nNeighbors:\n\n- **UP \u2192 (3,9)**  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (3,7)**  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (2,8)**  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (4,8)** (our own neck)\n\nCheck for instant death:\n\n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,8) = backwards into our body \u274c  \n- UP (3,9): not our body, not enemy body, in bounds \u2705  \n- DOWN (3,7): same, all clear \u2705  \n- LEFT (2,8): same, all clear \u2705  \n\nNo apples on any of these squares, so our tail at **(4,6)** will move off and everything else shifts forward. Our block at **(8,9)** stays put, so enemy is still doomed regardless of our choice.\n\nSo all of **UP, DOWN, LEFT** keep us alive and enemy still dies.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Which *good* move do we pick?\n\nWe still follow good fundamentals, right chat? \ud83d\ude09\n\nFrom each new head:\n\n- **If UP to (3,9)** (top edge):\n  - Next-turn outs: LEFT (2,9), RIGHT (4,9). Edge behind, off-board above. \u2714\ufe0f but a bit cramped.\n\n- **If DOWN to (3,7)**:\n  - Next-turn outs: LEFT (2,7), RIGHT (4,7), maybe DOWN (3,6). Decent room.\n\n- **If LEFT to (2,8)**:\n  - Next-turn outs: UP (2,9), DOWN (2,7), LEFT (1,8).  \n  - Three clean options, center-ish, lots of future space and closer to left-side apples if game somehow continued. Maximum flexibility. \u2705\n\nWe don\u2019t need to risk anything fancy; enemy is auto-dead. Best is to float left into open space with lots of options.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccb Mini-plan for future me\n\n- Slide **LEFT** this turn to (2,8), staying away from walls and keeping three future exits.\n- Enemy has no safe moves and will crash into either our body or their own, so the game ends with us alive and ahead on apples.\n- If for any weird engine reason they somehow live (lol), we\u2019re well-positioned on the left side with tons of mobility to keep growing and re-box them later.\n\nLEFT",
