Length 2.  \n- Apples: (3,1), (5,8), (8,0), (0,3), (8,6).  \n- Enemy snake #1: head at (0,2), no body yet (length 1).  \n\nFrom last turn\u2019s move DOWN, I ate the apple at (5,3), so now my body occupies (5,4) and head is at (5,3).  \nMy next move must avoid moving UP into (5,4) \u2014 that would kill me.\n\n**Step 1: Check immediate safety of each direction**\n\n- UP: from (5,3) \u2192 (5,4). That\u2019s my own body \u2192 **dead**.  \n- DOWN: from (5,3) \u2192 (5,2). Inside board, not my body, not enemy body.  \n- LEFT: from (5,3) \u2192 (4,3). Inside board, not my body, not enemy body.  \n- RIGHT: from (5,3) \u2192 (6,3). Inside board, not my body, not enemy body.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy snake movement**  \nEnemy head at (0,2). Possible moves for enemy: UP to (0,3) (apple there), DOWN to (0,1), RIGHT to (1,2), LEFT is off-board.  \nIf enemy moves UP to (0,3), he eats apple and grows to length 2 next turn. That doesn\u2019t threaten me this turn.\n\nNo immediate collision possible because enemy is far away.\n\n**Step 3: Look at apples**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (3,1) \u2192 distance |5-3|+|3-1|=4  \n- (8,0) \u2192 distance 10  \n- (5,8) \u2192 distance 5  \n- (0,3) \u2192 distance 8  \n- (8,6) \u2192 distance 6  \n\n(3,1) is closest. To get there: need to go LEFT twice then DOWN twice, or DOWN twice then LEFT twice.\n\n**Step 4: Check follow-up safety after each move**\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5,2):  \n- Next turn, my body: head at (5,2), body at (5,3),(5,4).  \n- From (5,2), safe moves: DOWN to (5,1), LEFT to (4,2), RIGHT to (6,2). UP to (5,3) is my body \u2192 unsafe. That\u2019s 3 safe moves.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4,3):  \n- Body: head (4,3), body (5,3),(5,4).  \n- From (4,3), safe moves: UP to (4,4) safe, DOWN to (4,2) safe, LEFT to (3,3) safe, RIGHT to (5,3) is my body \u2192 unsafe. That\u2019s 3 safe moves.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6,3):  \n- Body: head (6,3), body (5,3),(5,4).  \n- From (6,3), safe moves: UP to (6,4) safe, DOWN to (6,2) safe, RIGHT to (7,3) safe, LEFT to (5,3) is my body \u2192 unsafe. That\u2019s 3 safe moves.\n\nAll have 3 safe follow-ups. So no immediate trap.\n\n**Step 5: Which move gets me toward closest apple (3,1)?**  \nLEFT then DOWN is a good start. So LEFT now is aligned with that.  \nDOWN also works, but then I\u2019d need LEFT later \u2014 still fine.\n\nLEFT seems slightly better because:  \n- It moves toward (3,1) directly.  \n- It keeps me away from enemy area (enemy is at left edge, but at y=2, I\u2019m at y=3 going to x=4 then maybe down).  \n- Moving RIGHT takes me away from closest apple.\n\n**Step 6: Consider enemy possibly moving toward (0,3) apple**  \nIf enemy moves UP to (0,3), he\u2019ll grow and his body will be at (0,2) next turn. That doesn\u2019t affect my path to (3,1).\n\n**Conclusion:** LEFT is safe and progresses toward nearest apple while keeping options open.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (4,3), avoid RIGHT (into my body). Then consider moving DOWN toward (3,1) or UP toward other apples if safe. Keep tracking enemy movement.\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 2): Empty, in bounds, safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 2): Empty, in bounds, safe.  \n\nSo unsafe: UP (hits own body). Safe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**2. Consider enemy movement:**  \nEnemy at (1, 3) could move UP (1,4), DOWN (1,2), LEFT (0,3) hits its own body segment, RIGHT (2,3).  \nDOWN to (1,2) could be a threat if I go LEFT to (3,2) but not directly adjacent yet.  \nRIGHT to (2,3) doesn\u2019t threaten immediate head-on collision with my safe moves.  \nNo adjacent head-to-head risk this turn.  \n\n**3. Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple: (3, 1) \u2192 distance from my head (4,2) = |4-3|+|2-1| = 1+1=2.  \nFrom (4,2):  \n- DOWN (4,1): distance to (3,1) = 1 (good).  \n- LEFT (3,2): distance to (3,1) = 1 (good).  \n- RIGHT (5,2): distance to (3,1) = 3 (worse).  \n\nDOWN and LEFT both equally close to nearest apple.  \n\n**4.

DOWN to (4,0) in bounds.  \nSo 4 possible moves next turn, 1 leads to apple.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,2):  \nNext turn moves:  \n- UP (3,3) empty,  \n- DOWN (3,1) apple,  \n- LEFT (2,2) empty,  \n- RIGHT (4,2) empty (current head position).  \nAlso 4 possible moves, 1 leads to apple.  \n\nBoth keep flexibility, but DOWN puts me at (4,1) with apple (3,1) one step LEFT or DOWN.  \nLEFT puts me at (3,2) with apple (3,1) one step DOWN.  \n\n**5. Long-term positioning:**  \nAfter eating (3,1), my body will be [(4,2), (4,3)] plus new segment, so tail at (4,3) remains for a while.  \nIf I go DOWN now, I can still go LEFT next turn to eat apple. If I go LEFT now, I can go DOWN next turn to eat apple.  \nBut DOWN leaves me more central (x=4) for accessing right-side apples later.  \nEnemy is on left side (x=1), so moving LEFT gets slightly closer to enemy\u2019s possible path, but not dangerously so.  \n\n**6. Tie-breaker:**  \nSince apples are tied at 1 each, I want to secure (3,1) safely without risking head-on.  \nBoth DOWN and LEFT seem safe this turn. But going DOWN means my next move to apple is LEFT, which might be toward enemy\u2019s general area but enemy is at y=3, I\u2019ll be at y=1.  \nGoing LEFT now means next move DOWN to apple, moving away from enemy\u2019s y-level.  \n\nActually, enemy at (1,3) could move DOWN to (1,2), then next turn could move LEFT to (0,2) or RIGHT to (2,2) \u2014 not threatening (3,1) immediately.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose **DOWN** to stay more central and keep options open for apples on right half after this apple.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving DOWN to (4,1), move LEFT to (3,1) to eat apple unless enemy head is adjacent to (3,1). Then grow, and plan route toward (5,8) or (8,6) while avoiding traps.  \n\nDOWN",

So I should avoid moving UP next turn if enemy might be at (3,2). That\u2019s manageable.  \n\n**6. Long-term:**  \nEating now gives me score advantage (2 vs 1). More apples also means longer body, which can be risky later, but early growth helps control space.  \nSafer to eat while it\u2019s clear.  \n\nLEFT is safe this turn and gets apple immediately.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (3,1), avoid moving UP into possible enemy position if enemy moves toward (3,2).

Getting apple sooner reduces risk of losing it to enemy.  \n\nTherefore RIGHT is optimal.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove RIGHT to (5,0) and eat apple.

If enemy moves LEFT/RIGHT, it stays at y=5.  \n\n**Head-on collision risk:**  \nEnemy could move DOWN to (8,4) (its body) \u2014 invalid for enemy.  \nEnemy could move LEFT to (7,5) or RIGHT to (9,5).  \nNone of my safe moves (8,2), (7,1), (9,1) are adjacent to enemy's possible destinations (7,5), (9,5), (8,6), so no head-on risk this turn.  \n\n**Future options:**  \n- UP (8,2): Next moves from there could be UP/LEFT/RIGHT (DOWN into my body). Puts me closer to apples at (8,6),(9,6),(9,8).  \n- LEFT (7,1): Next moves from there UP/DOWN/LEFT (RIGHT back to (8,1) safe).

Limits future options.  \n\nRIGHT seems worst for future mobility.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple to (8,1) is (8,6) distance |8-8|+|6-1|=5.  \nFrom (8,2) distance to (8,6)=4.  \nFrom (7,1) distance to (8,6)=|7-8|+|1-6|=6.  \nFrom (9,1) distance to (8,6)=|9-8|+|1-6|=6.  \nSo UP gets me closer to nearest apple.  \n\n**Enemy proximity:**  \nEnemy at (8,5) is close vertically. Moving to (8,2) puts me just 3 cells below enemy head. That could be risky next turn if enemy moves DOWN twice, but enemy length=2, so it might go for apple at (8,6) UP instead.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI have 4 apples, enemy has 1. I want to avoid head-on collisions because I'm longer. Prefer moving LEFT to open space and collect apples on left side (5,8),(6,8) while staying away from enemy.  \n\nLEFT (7,1) gives more future options and avoids moving directly under enemy.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nLEFT seems safer strategically, keeps options open, and avoids tight vertical alignment with enemy.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (7,1), consider moving UP toward row 8 apples while keeping distance from enemy at (8,5).  \n\nLEFT",

Immediate death. Not safe.\n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,2):  \n  - Not off board.  \n  - Not my body.  \n  - Not enemy body.  \n  - Safe.\n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,2):  \n  - Not off board.  \n  - Not my body.  \n  - Not enemy body.  \n  - Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow consider enemy snake #1 head at (9,7). Possible moves for it:  \n- UP \u2192 (9,8) \u2014 apple there.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,6) \u2014 its own body (tail is at (8,5)? Wait, its body: [(9,6), (8,6), (8,5)] so (9,6) is its second segment \u2192 not safe for it.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,7) \u2014 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 not safe.  \n\nSo enemy can move UP or LEFT. If it moves UP to (9,8), it will eat apple and grow, making its body longer but still far from me. If it moves LEFT to (8,7), it moves toward center but still distant.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk because my possible moves (6,3), (5,2), (7,2) are far from (9,7), (9,8), (8,7).\n\nNow apples:  \nClosest apple is (7,3) at distance |6-7|+|2-3|=2.  \n- UP to (6,3) \u2192 distance to (7,3) becomes 1.  \n- RIGHT to (7,2) \u2192 distance to (7,3) becomes 1 as well.  \n- LEFT to (5,2) \u2192 distance to (7,3) becomes 3.\n\nSo UP and RIGHT both get me closer to the nearest apple.\n\nFuture mobility from each:  \nFrom (6,3): possible moves UP (6,4), DOWN (6,2), LEFT (5,3), RIGHT (7,3) \u2014 all 4 are safe currently (check: (6,2) will be empty next turn because my head moves away; (7,3) is apple, safe). Good.\n\nFrom (7,2): possible moves UP (7,3) apple, DOWN (7,1) my body? Wait, my body currently has (7,1) but next turn my body will shift: current head (6,2) moves to (7,2), so (6,2) becomes new second segment, (6,1) becomes third, (7,1) becomes fourth, (8,1) becomes fifth, (8,0) becomes tail. So (7,1) will be empty next turn. So from (7,2), DOWN to (7,1) is safe. LEFT (6,2) will be my old head position? No, old head position (6,2) becomes my second segment after moving to (7,2), so LEFT into (6,2) would be my own body \u2192 not safe. RIGHT (8,2) empty. So from (7,2), safe moves next turn would be UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 moves). Slightly less than UP\u2019s 4.\n\nFrom (5,2): moves UP (5,3), DOWN (5,1), LEFT (4,2), RIGHT (6,2) \u2014 RIGHT into (6,2) would be my own body (second segment next turn), so not safe. So from (5,2), safe: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 moves) and moves away from nearest apple.\n\nUP gives best mobility and keeps apple close.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,3), apple (7,3) is adjacent RIGHT. Consider moving RIGHT to eat it if enemy not threatening. Also look at apple cluster at top: (5,8), (9,8), (6,8), (4,6). Might plan path to (4,6) after (7,3). Keep enemy in view \u2014 it\u2019s on right edge, likely moving UP toward apples there, so I should stay central/left to avoid head-on later.\n\n**UP**",

Immediate death \u2192 unsafe.  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8,3):  \n  - Within board.  \n  - Not my body.  \n  - Not enemy body.  \n  - Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n**Enemy possible moves:**  \nEnemy head (8,8):  \n- UP \u2192 (8,9) empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,7) empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,8) empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,8) its own body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo enemy can go UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Risk of head-on collision:**  \nMy UP (7,4), DOWN (7,2), RIGHT (8,3) are far from enemy possible moves (8,9),(8,7),(7,8). No direct overlap. Safe.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n- Closest apple is (4,6) distance |7-4|+|3-6|=4.  \n- (5,8) and (6,8) are farther.  \n- (0,5) far left.  \n- (9,2) far right bottom.  \n\nNo apple adjacent now.  \n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n\n1. **UP to (7,4)**:  \n   Next turn body: head (7,4), then (7,3),(6,3),(6,2),(6,1),(7,1),(8,1) length 7.  \n   From (7,4): possible moves UP (7,5), DOWN (7,3), LEFT (6,4), RIGHT (8,4).  \n   - DOWN (7,3) will be my second segment \u2192 unsafe.  \n   Others empty \u2192 safe: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n2. **DOWN to (7,2)**:  \n   Next turn body: head (7,2), then (7,3),(6,3),(6,2),(6,1),(7,1),(8,1).  \n   From (7,2): possible moves UP (7,3), DOWN (7,1), LEFT (6,2), RIGHT (8,2).  \n   - UP (7,3) my second segment \u2192 unsafe.  \n   - DOWN (7,1) my own body \u2192 unsafe.  \n   So safe: LEFT, RIGHT (only 2 options). Worse.  \n\n3. **RIGHT to (8,3)**:  \n   Next turn body: head (8,3), then (7,3),(6,3),(6,2),(6,1),(7,1),(8,1).  \n   From (8,3): possible moves UP (8,4), DOWN (8,2), LEFT (7,3), RIGHT (9,3).  \n   - LEFT (7,3) my second segment \u2192 unsafe.  \n   Others empty \u2192 safe: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nDOWN gives fewer safe follow-ups \u2192 avoid unless necessary. UP and RIGHT both give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nMove toward apple (4,6) gradually via left/up moves. Currently UP moves me closer in y-direction, RIGHT moves away but keeps right side open. Avoid trapping myself near bottom left later.  \n\nEnemy is top-right, far away. I can safely collect apples on left side (4,6) and (0,5). Next turn after UP, I could go LEFT toward (4,6). After RIGHT, I could go UP later.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gives good future options and moves toward (4,6). RIGHT also good but slightly away from nearest apple. Avoid DOWN due to fewer options.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf UP to (7,4), next turn consider LEFT to (6,4) to continue toward apple (4,6), but check enemy movement and keep escape routes.  \n\nUP",

So enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Collision risk this turn:**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (9,3), enemy cannot reach (9,3) in one move from (5,8).  \nIf I go DOWN to (8,2), enemy cannot reach (8,2) in one move.  \nNo immediate head-on risk.  \n\n**Future safety after each move:**  \n- RIGHT to (9,3): eat apple \u2192 grow by 1 \u2192 new head at apple, body will extend by 1 segment at tail end after move. After moving, my head at (9,3), body will be: [(9,3), (8,3), (8,4), (7,4), (7,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)] \u2014 but note: (8,3) is current head, so after move, head at (9,3), then previous head (8,3) becomes neck, etc. Tail (6,1) stays until next move.  \nNext turn from (9,3): safe moves? UP (9,4) empty, DOWN (9,2) apple, LEFT (8,3) own body? Wait, (8,3) will be neck after growth, so it's occupied. So LEFT unsafe. RIGHT off board. So only UP and DOWN safe next turn if I go RIGHT now. That\u2019s limited options (2 safe moves).  \n\n- DOWN to (8,2): no apple. Body: [(8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (7,4), (7,3), (6,3), (6,2), (6,1)] \u2014 but tail still (6,1) since no growth. Actually length stays 7 segments (head + 6 body). So after move: head (8,2), neck (8,3), then (8,4), etc.  \nNext turn from (8,2): UP (8,3) own body unsafe, DOWN (8,1) empty, LEFT (7,2) empty, RIGHT (9,2) apple. So safe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 safe moves). More flexibility.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nRIGHT gets apple immediately, increasing my apples to 7 vs enemy 6 (they might eat one this turn too).  \nDOWN sets up for (9,2) apple next turn if I go RIGHT then, but enemy could also go for (9,2)? Enemy is far (5,8), needs 4 moves min to (9,2), so not immediate threat.  \n\n**Strategic note:**  \nLast turn rationale said: after DOWN to (8,3), move DOWN to (8,2) to open more safe moves, then consider RIGHT to (9,2). That\u2019s exactly this situation now. Following that plan maintains flexibility and sets up for (9,2) safely.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT now, I eat (9,3) but then am stuck in top-right corner with only UP/DOWN next turn, which could be risky if enemy approaches later.  \n\nGiven the plan and safety, DOWN seems better for keeping options open. Eating (9,2) next turn is still possible. Enemy might go for (4,6) or (0,5) this turn, so apple race is not urgent.  \n\n**Decision:** DOWN.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (8,2), likely go RIGHT to (9,2) to eat apple, then from (9,2) go DOWN to (9,1) to avoid corner trap, then LEFT to (8,1), etc., working toward center.

Actually growth adds segment at tail end, so tail remains at (6,2). So (8,3) is occupied (4th segment). So from (9,3) next turn safe moves: UP (9,4) and RIGHT off board invalid.

So only UP possible again \u2014 forces me north into top row with enemy possibly approaching. Dangerous.  \n\nBetter to skip apple now, go DOWN to (9,1), then next turn maybe LEFT to (8,1) toward center board, aim for apple (8,5) or (4,6) later.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (9,1) go LEFT to (8,1), then up toward (8,5) apple, avoiding enemy path.

Wait, body will be [(6,2),(7,1),...] so (6,1) is empty next turn. Actually (6,1) will be empty because my head moved to (6,2) and my neck is at old head (6,1) only if I reversed? No, my neck will be (6,1) only if I moved DOWN from (6,2), but we\u2019re checking from (6,2) possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN to (6,1) would be moving back into my neck next turn? Let\u2019s check: next turn body: head (6,2), neck (6,1), rest\u2026 so DOWN from (6,2) to (6,1) would hit my own neck \u2014 so not safe. So from (6,2), safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT? RIGHT to (7,2) safe? My body: (7,1) is not (7,2), enemy body no. So yes safe.

That\u2019s old head position, but next turn body: head (5,1), neck (6,1)? Wait, my neck after moving to (5,1) is (6,1) (old head).

Possible moves from (5,2):**  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 3)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 1) \u2192 occupied by my body (5,1) \u2192 invalid (suicide)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 2)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 2)  \n\nSo DOWN is immediately out.\n\n---\n\n**2. Check each remaining move for immediate death:**\n\n**UP (5,3):**  \nBoard shows empty at (5,3) currently.  \nEnemy body check: enemy body cells:  \n(1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(4,6),(4,7),(5,7),(5,8) \u2014 none at (5,3).  \nMy body: none at (5,3).  \nOn-board: yes.  \nHead-on collision risk: enemy head at (0,5) can't reach (5,3) in one move (max move distance 1).  \nSo UP is safe.\n\n**LEFT (4,2):**  \nEmpty currently? Board shows empty at (4,2) (row y=2, x=4 is '.').  \nEnemy body: none at (4,2).  \nMy body: none at (4,2).  \nOn-board: yes.  \nHead-on collision: enemy head at (0,5) \u2192 possible moves for enemy: UP (0,6), DOWN (0,4), LEFT (-1,5) invalid, RIGHT (1,5) which is its own body (1,5) so invalid unless it chooses suicide. Enemy likely won't suicide into own body. So enemy's safe moves: UP to (0,6) or DOWN to (0,4). Neither is (4,2). So no head-on risk.  \nLEFT is safe.\n\n**RIGHT (6,2):**  \nCurrently empty? Board shows '.' at (6,2).  \nEnemy body: none there.  \nMy body: none there.  \nOn-board: yes.  \nHead-on collision: enemy can't reach (6,2) from (0,5) in one move.  \nRIGHT is safe.\n\nSo all three moves UP, LEFT, RIGHT are immediately safe.\n\n---\n\n**3. Preference: move towards apples & keep future options open.**\n\nApples:  \n- (8,5): Manhattan distance from (5,2) = |8-5|+|5-2| = 3+3=6  \n- (9,3): dist = 4+1=5  \n- (1,3): dist = 4+1=5  \n- (4,9): dist = 1+7=8  \n- (0,1): dist = 5+1=6  \n\nClosest apples are (9,3) and (1,3) both distance 5.\n\nFrom my head (5,2):  \nUP (5,3): gets me closer to (9,3)? From (5,3) to (9,3): dist=4+0=4 (currently 5), yes closer. Also closer to (8,5)? From (5,3) to (8,5): 3+2=5 (currently 6), yes closer.  \nLEFT (4,2): gets me closer to (1,3): from (4,2) to (1,3): 3+1=4 (currently 5), yes closer. Also closer to (0,1): 4+1=5 (currently 6), yes closer.  \nRIGHT (6,2): gets me closer to (9,3): from (6,2) to (9,3): 3+1=4 (currently 5), yes closer.\n\nSo all moves bring me closer to some apple except maybe UP brings me closer to two apples ((9,3) and (8,5)), LEFT brings me closer to two apples ((1,3) and (0,1)), RIGHT brings me closer to only (9,3) maybe.\n\n---\n\n**4. Future options after each move:**\n\nCheck board occupancy after move:\n\n**UP to (5,3):**  \nThen possible moves from (5,3): UP (5,4), DOWN (5,2) my old head now empty? Wait, body segments: my body segments: after moving UP, my body shifts: new body = [(5,3), (5,2), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (8,2)] \u2014 so (5,2) becomes my 2nd segment. So DOWN from (5,3) goes to (5,2) which is my own body \u2192 invalid.  \nFrom (5,3): UP (5,4) empty now, LEFT (4,3) empty now, RIGHT (6,3) empty now. So 3 safe moves next turn? Actually check: DOWN invalid, so 3 moves possible: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Good.\n\n**LEFT to (4,2):**  \nThen body = [(4,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2), (8,2)]? Wait length is 8, so tail (8,2) disappears because no apple eaten. Actually my current length is 8 segments. After moving without eating apple, length stays 8, so tail (8,2) is removed, new body = head at (4,2) + old body minus tail: so (5,2),(5,1),(6,1),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(9,2) as rest. So from (4,2): possible moves: UP (4,3) empty, DOWN (4,1) empty, LEFT (3,2) empty, RIGHT (5,2) my body \u2192 invalid. So 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n**RIGHT to (6,2):**  \nBody = [(6,2), (5,2), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (9,2)] \u2014 tail (8,2) removed. From (6,2): UP (6,3) empty, DOWN (6,1) my body \u2192 invalid, LEFT (5,2) my body \u2192 invalid, RIGHT (7,2) empty. So only 2 safe moves next turn (UP, RIGHT). Worse.\n\nSo RIGHT reduces future options more than UP or LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**5. Enemy snake #1 possible moves from (0,5):**  \nIts body: (1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(4,6),(4,7),(5,7),(5,8)  \nPossible moves: UP (0,6) empty, DOWN (0,4) empty, LEFT (-1,5) off-board \u2192 invalid, RIGHT (1,5) its own body \u2192 invalid. So enemy will choose UP or DOWN. Likely UP to (0,6) to go toward apple (4,9)? Or DOWN to (0,4) toward apple (0,1)?  \nApple (0,1) is closer to enemy head (0,5) via DOWN: dist=0+4=4. Apple (4,9) via UP: dist=4+4=8. So enemy might go DOWN toward (0,1). That means enemy could be at (0,4) next turn, far from me. No head-on risk for me.\n\n---\n\n**6. Which apple is safest to pursue?**  \nApple (0,1) is close to enemy if enemy moves DOWN. Apple (9,3) is far from enemy.  \nMy UP move toward (9,3) seems safe.  \nApple (1,3) also close to enemy if enemy moves DOWN to (0,4) then next turn to (0,3) etc.  \nBut going LEFT toward (1,3) might race enemy for (0,1) indirectly.\n\nGiven enemy has more apples (8 vs my 7), I should avoid risky races and go for apple farther from enemy: (9,3) or (8,5). UP is toward both.\n\n---\n\n**7. Long-term plan:**  \nMove toward top-right apples while avoiding trapping myself. Keep space open; prefer paths with multiple exits. Avoid long body of enemy snake near left side.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** UP gives me more options next turn (3 moves), moves me toward apples far from enemy, and is safe.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (5,3), consider moving toward (9,3) via RIGHT or UP depending on board. Avoid moving into possible future enemy path.\n\nUP",

On-board: yes.  \nHead-on collision risk: enemy head at (0, 4) \u2192 possible moves for enemy: UP (0, 5) its own body \u2192 invalid; DOWN (0, 3) empty; LEFT (-1, 4) off-board \u2192 invalid; RIGHT (1, 4) empty. So enemy can go DOWN or RIGHT. Neither is (5, 4). Safe.  \n\n**LEFT (4, 3):**  \nEmpty currently? Yes. Enemy body: none there.

Wait, (6, 2) is '.' currently, but after move, my body is (5, 3), (5, 2), (6, 1), ... (6, 2) is free. Actually yes, (6, 2) empty. LEFT (5, 3) my body \u2192 invalid, RIGHT (7, 3) empty. So 3 safe moves next turn? Let's check: UP, DOWN, RIGHT = 3. Yes, 3 safe moves.  \n\nSo all three moves give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Apples proximity:**  \n\nFrom (5, 3):  \n- (8, 5): dist = |8-5|+|5-3| = 3+2 = 5  \n- (9, 3): dist = 4+0 = 4  \n- (1, 3): dist = 4+0 = 4  \n- (4, 9): dist = 1+6 = 7  \n- (0, 1): dist = 5+2 = 7  \n\nClosest: (9, 3) and (1, 3) both distance 4.  \n\n**UP (5, 4):** dist to (9, 3) = 4+1 = 5 (worse), dist to (8, 5) = 3+1 = 4 (better than 5), dist to (4, 9) = 1+5 = 6 (better than 7).  \n**LEFT (4, 3):** dist to (1, 3) = 3+0 = 3 (better than 4), dist to (0, 1) = 4+2 = 6 (better than 7).  \n**RIGHT (6, 3):** dist to (9, 3) = 3+0 = 3 (better than 4), dist to (8, 5) = 2+2 = 4 (better than 5).  \n\n---\n\n**5. Enemy snake\u2019s possible moves and risk:**  \n\nEnemy head (0, 4):  \nUP (0, 5) its own body \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN (0, 3) empty.  \nLEFT off-board \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT (1, 4) empty.  \nSo enemy can go DOWN or RIGHT.  \nApple (0, 1) is below; apple (1, 3) is diagonal. Likely DOWN toward (0, 1) or RIGHT toward center.  \n\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (1, 4), then next turn could threaten (1, 3) apple. If I go LEFT toward (1, 3), we might race. Since enemy is longer and has more apples, risking head-on near apple isn\u2019t wise.  \n\nApple (9, 3) is far from enemy, safer to pursue.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term plan:**  \n\nI\u2019m behind in apples (7 vs 8), need to catch up safely. Target apples far from enemy: (9, 3) and (8, 5). Moving UP positions me to go right next toward (9, 3) or (8, 5). Moving RIGHT also works but puts me closer to (9, 3) immediately.  \n\nFrom (5, 4) next turn: I can go RIGHT to (6, 4) then up toward (8, 5) or right toward (9, 3). From (6, 3) next turn: I can go UP to (6, 4) similarly. Both fine.  \n\nBut UP gives slightly better central position and keeps both top-right apples in reach while staying away from enemy\u2019s likely path toward bottom-left apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** UP toward top-right apples, safe, good options next turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (5, 4), consider moving RIGHT toward (9, 3) or UP toward (8, 5) depending on board. Avoid moving left into possible enemy path.  \n\nUP",

Dropping one step down opens a whole new row (y\u202f=\u202f1) that is currently free of our own body and only touches the enemy\u2019s tail at (5,1)\u2011(8,1), which is far to the right, so no immediate collision risk.\n\n**Strategic preference**\n\nAmong the safe options, moving **DOWN** gives us:\n1. Immediate access to additional empty space below our current shape, avoiding a potential dead\u2011end that could appear if we keep moving upward or rightward into our growing body.\n2. Closer proximity to the apple at (0,1) and the same\u2011row apple at (6,2), increasing the chance of eating an apple soon.\n3. Preservation of multiple future directions (we could later go left to (0,2), right toward (2,2), or continue down toward (1,1) etc.), keeping our path flexible.\n\nTherefore, the optimal move this turn is **DOWN**.  \n\nDOWN",

Immediate safety (this turn):**  \nCheck each candidate cell for being in bounds and not occupied by any snake body currently:  \n\n**UP (5, 6):** On board, empty currently (board shows '.'), not in my body, not in enemy body.  \n**LEFT (4, 5):** On board, empty currently (board shows '.'), not in my body, not in enemy body.  \n**RIGHT (6, 5):** On board, empty currently (board shows '.'), not in my body, not in enemy body.  \n\nAll three are safe from static obstacles.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Head-on collision risk:**  \nEnemy head at (1, 3) can move: UP (1, 4), DOWN (1, 2), LEFT (0, 3), RIGHT (2, 3).  \nNone of these are (5, 6), (4, 5), or (6, 5). So no possible head-on collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Future options after each move:**  \n\n**UP to (5, 6):**  \nNext turn from (5, 6): UP (5, 7) empty, DOWN (5, 5) my body (invalid), LEFT (4, 6) empty, RIGHT (6, 6) empty \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**LEFT to (4, 5):**  \nNext turn from (4, 5): UP (4, 6) empty, DOWN (4, 4) empty, LEFT (3, 5) empty, RIGHT (5, 5) my body \u2192 invalid \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**RIGHT to (6, 5):**  \nNext turn from (6, 5): UP (6, 6) empty, DOWN (6, 4) empty, LEFT (5, 5) my body \u2192 invalid, RIGHT (7, 5) empty \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nAll three give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Apple proximity:**  \n\nFrom (5, 5):  \n- (8, 5): dist 3  \n- (9, 3): dist 4  \n- (4, 9): dist 5  \n- (0, 1): dist 9  \n- (6, 2): dist 3  \n\nClosest apples: (8, 5) dist 3, (6, 2) dist 3.  \n\n**UP (5, 6):** dist to (8, 5) = 3, to (6, 2) = 4, to (4, 9) = 4.  \n**LEFT (4, 5):** dist to (8, 5) = 4, to (6, 2) = 4, to (4, 9) = 4.  \n**RIGHT (6, 5):** dist to (8, 5) = 2, to (6, 2) = 3, to (9, 3) = 3.  \n\nRIGHT gets me closest to (8, 5) (dist 2), also close to (6, 2) and (9, 3).  \n\n---\n\n**6. Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy at (1, 3) likely wants apples: (6, 2) is far from them, (0, 1) close but they'd have to go down-left possibly into my body later. Their closest apple is (0, 1) dist 3, but (4, 9) far. They might move toward (0, 1) via (1, 2) or (0, 3).  \n\nIf they go toward (0, 1), they move away from my planned path to (8, 5) or (9, 3).  \n\n---\n\n**7. Risk of trapping:**  \nMoving RIGHT to (6, 5) \u2192 next turn I can go RIGHT to (7, 5) then (8, 5), or DOWN to (6, 4) then (6, 3) etc. My body blocks (5, 5) behind me, but that's fine.  \n\nLEFT to (4, 5) gets me closer to enemy\u2019s side, not ideal since enemy is longer and could cut me off later.  \n\nUP to (5, 6) central but delays apple collection.  \n\nGiven I'm behind in apples (7 vs 9), I should prioritize quickly getting apples safely.  \n\n---\n\n**8. Choice:**  \nRIGHT moves toward (8, 5) and (9, 3), keeps future options open (UP/DOWN/RIGHT next turn), and stays away from enemy\u2019s current location.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (6, 5), consider RIGHT toward (8, 5) or DOWN toward (6, 2) apple, depending on enemy position. Avoid moving into possible enemy path if they head toward center.  \n\nRIGHT",

Risk of eating apple:**  \nEating apple at (8,5) means my body grows by 1, so my tail stays at (6,1) instead of moving to (7,1). That means next turn my body will occupy (7,5) still, making LEFT from (8,5) invalid. That\u2019s fine because I still have UP/DOWN/RIGHT from (8,5).  \n\n---\n\n**7. Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy head at (1,1) likely wants apple at (0,1) (adjacent DOWN or LEFT). They might move LEFT to (0,1) apple. That\u2019s far from me, no conflict.  \n\n---\n\n**8. Choice:**  \nRIGHT eats apple now, increases my length to 9 (still behind enemy\u2019s 10), and keeps good mobility. No immediate danger.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (8,5), I\u2019ll be at length 9, head at (8,5). Next turn I should avoid moving LEFT into my body at (7,5). Options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Assess then for safety and apple proximity (maybe (9,3) is close). Keep monitoring enemy movement toward (0,1) or (6,2).  \n\nRIGHT",
