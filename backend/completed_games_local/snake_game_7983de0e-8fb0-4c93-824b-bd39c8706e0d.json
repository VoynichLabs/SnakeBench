The enemy snake (ID 0) is at (2, 3).\nThe board is 10x10, coordinates (0,0) to (9,9).\nApples are at: (3, 5), (5, 6), (5, 0), (3, 0), (1, 1).\n\nMy goal is to collect apples and survive. Since it's turn 0, I only have head segments, so there's no danger of hitting my own body. The primary immediate dangers are going off-board or hitting the enemy head (which is unlikely given the distance).\n\nMy current position is (7, 8).\n\nPossible moves and resulting positions:\n1. UP: (7, 9)\n2. DOWN: (7, 7)\n3. LEFT: (6, 8)\n4. RIGHT: (8, 8)\n\nCheck for immediate death:\n1. **UP (7, 9)**: Safe, on board.\n2. **DOWN (7, 7)**: Safe, on board.\n3. **LEFT (6, 8)**: Safe, on board.\n4. **RIGHT (8, 8)**: Safe, on board.\n\nAll four moves are safe in terms of hitting walls or my own body.\n\nNow, consider proximity to apples.\nApples are at:\nA1: (3, 5) - Distance Manhattan: |7-3| + |8-5| = 4 + 3 = 7\nA2: (5, 6) - Distance Manhattan: |7-5| + |8-6| = 2 + 2 = 4\nA3: (5, 0) - Distance Manhattan: |7-5| + |8-0| = 2 + 8 = 10\nA4: (3, 0) - Distance Manhattan: |7-3| + |8-0| = 4 + 8 = 12\nA5: (1, 1) - Distance Manhattan: |7-1| + |8-1| = 6 + 7 = 13\n\nThe closest apple is A2 at (5, 6), distance 4.\n\nLet's see which move moves me closer to (5, 6):\nCurrent distance to (5, 6) is 4 (dx=2, dy=2).\n\n1. UP to (7, 9): Distance to (5, 6) is |7-5| + |9-6| = 2 + 3 = 5. (Further)\n2. DOWN to (7, 7): Distance to (5, 6) is |7-5| + |7-6| = 2 + 1 = 3. (Closer)\n3. LEFT to (6, 8): Distance to (5, 6) is |6-5| + |8-6| = 1 + 2 = 3. (Closer)\n4. RIGHT to (8, 8): Distance to (5, 6) is |8-5| + |8-6| = 3 + 2 = 5. (Further)\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT move me closer to the closest apple (5, 6).\n\nNow let's consider the enemy snake #0 at (2, 3).\nThe enemy snake is far away, so collision risk is minimal for now.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 7), I align vertically with A2 (5, 6). I would need to move LEFT next.\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 8), I align horizontally with my target x-coordinate 5. I would need to move DOWN next.\n\nLet's look at the density of apples in the lower-left quadrant vs. the upper-right quadrant.\nApples are clustered in the lower half of the board. Moving towards the center/bottom seems advantageous.\n\nMoving LEFT (to 6, 8) seems slightly better as it brings me closer to the left side where I need to be eventually to get to (5, 6) and other apples. It also keeps my options open potentially toward the top edge for longer, if needed.\n\nIf I choose LEFT: (6, 8). Next turn, I can go DOWN to (6, 7), then DOWN to (6, 6), then LEFT to (5, 6) to eat the apple. (3 turns to eat, assuming no blockage).\n\nIf I choose DOWN: (7, 7). Next turn, I can go DOWN to (7, 6), then LEFT to (6, 6), then LEFT to (5, 6) to eat the apple. (3 turns to eat, assuming no blockage).\n\nBoth lead to the apple (5, 6) in 3 turns assuming optimal path, giving them equal value for proximity to the nearest apple.\n\nLet's consider the enemy and other apples.\nEnemy is at (2, 3).\nIf I move LEFT, I maintain distance from x=2, y=3.\nIf I move DOWN, I move closer to y=3.\n\nSince both moves are equally good for reaching (5, 6) in the shortest time, I will choose the one that keeps me generally more centralized and offers more flexibility, which in this case doesn't show a strong preference.\n\nLet's look at potential future moves:\n\nFrom (6, 8) (LEFT):\nPossible next moves: UP (6, 9), DOWN (6, 7), LEFT (5, 8), RIGHT (7, 8 - backwards).\nTowards (5, 6): LEFT or DOWN are good options.\nLEFT to (5, 8) gets me closer to x=5.\nDOWN to (6, 7) gets me closer to y=6.\n\nFrom (7, 7) (DOWN):\nPossible next moves: UP (7, 8 - backwards), DOWN (7, 6), LEFT (6, 7), RIGHT (8, 7).\nTowards (5, 6): DOWN or LEFT are good options.\nDOWN to (7, 6) gets me closer to y=6.\nLEFT to (6, 7) gets me closer to x=5.\n\nBoth are good. I'll choose to prioritize the X-axis approach first since there are many apples clustered toward the left/center (x=3, x=5, x=1). Moving LEFT seems like a better general orientation.\n\nI choose LEFT.\n\nLong-term plan: Head towards Apple (5, 6).\n\nLEFT",

Length 1.\nApples: (3, 5), (5, 6), (5, 0), (3, 0), (1, 1).\n\nLast move: LEFT, resulting in my snake moving from (7, 8) to (6, 8). (Wait, the provided current head location is (6, 8), and the previous game state implies the previous head was at (7, 8). This is consistent with a LEFT move.)\n\n**Goal:** Move towards the closest apple, (5, 6), while staying safe.\n\n**1. Immediate Safety Check (from (6, 8))**\nBoard boundaries: (0-9, 0-9).\n\n*   UP to (6, 9): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (6, 7): Safe.\n*   LEFT to (5, 8): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (7, 8): Safe.\n\nNo immediate danger from self-collision (length 1) or wall collision.\nEnemy head is at (2, 4). There are no adjacent cells that put me in immediate head-on collision range (Manhattan distance is 4+4 = 8).\n\n**2. Proximity to Apples**\nClosest apple is A2 at (5, 6). Current Manhattan distance: |6-5| + |8-6| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n*   UP to (6, 9): Distance to (5, 6) is |6-5| + |9-6| = 1 + 3 = 4. (Further)\n*   DOWN to (6, 7): Distance to (5, 6) is |6-5| + |7-6| = 1 + 1 = 2. (Closer)\n*   LEFT to (5, 8): Distance to (5, 6) is |5-5| + |8-6| = 0 + 2 = 2. (Closer)\n*   RIGHT to (7, 8): Distance to (5, 6) is |7-5| + |8-6| = 2 + 2 = 4. (Further)\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT reduce the distance to the target apple (5, 6) to 2.\n\n**3. Choosing between DOWN and LEFT**\n\nTarget: (5, 6)\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (5, 8):** I achieve the target X-coordinate (5). I need 2 DOWN moves to reach (5, 6). Sequence: (6, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (5, 7) -> (5, 6). (2 more turns).\n*   **Move DOWN to (6, 7):** I get closer to the target Y-coordinate (6). I need 1 DOWN move and 1 LEFT move to reach (5, 6). Sequence: (6, 8) -> (6, 7) -> (6, 6) OR (5, 7) -> (5, 6). Let's trace the optimal path: (6, 8) -> (6, 7) -> (5, 7) (dist 1) -> (5, 6) (eat). (3 turns total, 2 more turns).\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are excellent options and lead to the apple in 2 subsequent moves (total 3 moves from the start).\n\n*   Path A (LEFT): (6, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (5, 7) -> (5, 6) [Apple]\n*   Path B (DOWN): (6, 8) -> (6, 7) -> (5, 7) -> (5, 6) [Apple]\n\nSince I have already committed to a more central/left trajectory (x=6 now), continuing the X-axis reduction (moving LEFT to x=5) seems slightly more direct as it perfectly aligns me with the target X, leaving only Y adjustment. It also moves me away from the right edge.\n\nLet's maintain the momentum towards the center/left where the majority of apples are located.\n\nI choose LEFT.\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**\nCurrent plan is to move towards Apple (5, 6). Next turn, I will be at (5, 8). I will then aim to move DOWN twice to reach (5, 6). This will put me in a good position to continue towards the low-Y apples (3, 0), (5, 0), and (1, 1).\n\nLEFT",

The goal was to align with the target apple (5, 6)'s X-coordinate.\n\n**Goal:** Continue moving towards the closest apple, (5, 6).\n\n**1. Immediate Safety Check (from (5, 8))**\nBoard boundaries: (0-9, 0-9).\n\n*   UP to (5, 9): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (5, 7): Safe. (Leads towards target)\n*   LEFT to (4, 8): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (6, 8): Safe.\n\nNo immediate danger from self-collision (length 1) or wall collision.\nEnemy head is at (2, 5).

(Further)\n\nThe only move that reduces the distance is DOWN. Moving DOWN to (5, 7) reduces the distance to 1, meaning I will eat the apple (5, 6) on the next turn by moving DOWN again.\n\n**3.

If the enemy moves RIGHT, they will be at (3, 5).\n\nMy move: DOWN to (5, 7).\nThe enemy is far away and their potential moves do not intersect or threaten my path to (5, 7) or the subsequent path to (5, 6).\n\n**4. Final Decision**\nMove DOWN to get closer to (5, 6).\n\n**Long-term strategy note for Turn 3:**\nNext turn, I will be at (5, 7). The apple (5, 6) will be directly DOWN. I will move DOWN to eat the apple. After eating the apple, the next targets for my snake (now length 2, head at (5, 6)) would be either the adjacent apple (3, 5) or the lowest apples (5, 0) and (3, 0). I will likely head towards the central lower region.\n\nDOWN",

The body moved from (2, 5) to (3, 5) last turn, so the tail is currently at (2, 5) if the head came from (2, 5). WAIT. The state says Head: (3, 5), Body: [(2, 5)]. So (2, 5) is the first body segment, the tail is (2, 5).\n        *   The enemy cannot move LEFT to (2, 5) as that hits its own body/tail.\n    *   The enemy cannot reach (5, 6) in one move (Min distance 2). I am safe to take the apple.\n\n**3. Move Selection - Proximity to Apples**\nThe apple (5, 6) is directly DOWN.\n\n*   DOWN to (5, 6): EATS apple. Ideal move.\n\n**4. Post-Move Strategy Note (Turn 4 onwards)**\nAfter moving DOWN, my snake will be at (5, 6), length 2 (new tail at (5, 7)).\nNew map state analysis will be needed, but the next targets look like:\n1. (5, 0) - Straight down. Distance: 6.\n2. (3, 0) - Down and Left. Distance: 2 + 6 = 8.\n3. (1, 1) - Down and Left. Distance: 4 + 5 = 9.\n4. (4, 9) - Up and Left. Distance: 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nThe enemy #0 is likely competing for the lower apples, though they just ate an apple (Head at (3, 5), body (2, 5)). They might go for (3, 0) or (1, 1).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 6), the immediate tactical choice for T4 will be between:\nA) Moving LEFT to (4, 6) towards (4, 9) (3 moves away)\nB) Moving DOWN to (5, 5) towards (5, 0) (5 moves away)\n\nGiven that the enemy is lower/left, going for the high apple (4, 9) might provide better isolation. However, (5, 0) is a straight line. I will evaluate safety on T4, but a preference towards (5, 0) seems reasonable as it's a straight shot, or towards (4, 9) if the enemy presses South aggressively.\n\nDOWN",

Safe.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 4) \u2014 empty, safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 5) \u2014 my body segment is there \u2192 death. Not allowed.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 5) \u2014 empty, safe.  \n\nSo LEFT is eliminated.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2014 Consider enemy possible moves and head-on collisions:**\n\nEnemy head at (5, 7), length 1, no body.  \nPossible enemy moves: UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7).  \n\nOur possible safe moves: UP (3,6), DOWN (3,4), RIGHT (4,5).  \n\nCheck if any of our safe moves would land on same cell as enemy\u2019s move **this turn** (simultaneous move).  \n\n- UP (3,6): enemy can\u2019t reach (3,6) in one move from (5,7). No collision.  \n- DOWN (3,4): enemy can\u2019t reach.  \n- RIGHT (4,5): enemy can\u2019t reach.  \n\nSo no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2014 Apple proximity and future options:**\n\nApples:  \n- (5, 6) \u2014 distance from (3,5): \u0394x=2, \u0394y=1 \u2192 Manhattan distance = 3.  \n- (5, 0) \u2014 far.  \n- (3, 0) \u2014 far.  \n- (1, 1) \u2014 far.  \n- (4, 9) \u2014 far.  \n\nClosest apple is (5, 6). From (3,5):  \n- UP to (3,6): distance to (5,6) = 2.  \n- RIGHT to (4,5): distance to (5,6) = 2.  \n- DOWN to (3,4): distance to (5,6) = 4.  \n\nSo UP and RIGHT are equally closer to nearest apple.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2014 Future mobility after each safe move:**\n\nFrom (3,6) after UP:  \nNeighbors: UP (3,7), DOWN (3,5) \u2014 my old head position? Wait, after move, body = [(3,6), (3,5), (2,5)]? No \u2014 current body is [(2,5)], head to (3,6), tail at (2,5) still? Actually, we ate an apple last turn? No \u2014 apples collected: 1, but length is 2 now, so we grew earlier, so body length = segments count = 2: head at (3,5), body at (2,5). After moving without eating, body becomes [(new head), (old head)], tail removed? No \u2014 we didn't eat this turn, so length stays same, snake moves: new head at (3,6), body becomes [(3,6), (3,5)], tail (2,5) disappears. So (3,5) occupied after UP move.  \n\nCheck from (3,6):  \nUP (3,7) free, DOWN (3,5) occupied by my body, LEFT (2,6) free, RIGHT (4,6) free \u2192 3 free squares.\n\nFrom (4,5) after RIGHT:  \nNeighbors: UP (4,6) free, DOWN (4,4) free, LEFT (3,5) occupied by my body, RIGHT (5,5) free \u2192 3 free squares.\n\nFrom (3,4) after DOWN:  \nNeighbors: UP (3,5) occupied by my body, DOWN (3,3) free, LEFT (2,4) free, RIGHT (4,4) free \u2192 3 free squares.\n\nAll safe moves give 3 free next-step options.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2014 Long-term planning:**\n\nEnemy at (5,7) might go for apple at (5,6) DOWN. If they do, they\u2019ll be at (5,6) next turn. If I go UP to (3,6), I\u2019m still 2 away from that apple, they\u2019d be on it next turn. If I go RIGHT to (4,5), I\u2019m closer to possibly intercept future apples but not (5,6) immediately.  \n\nGiven my small size, avoiding enemy head is wise \u2014 they\u2019re length 1, so they can\u2019t die by hitting their own body, but they could die by going off board or into me if I move into them (head-on). Not a risk this turn.  \n\nBut going UP puts me closer to top wall, slightly limits future down moves if needed. RIGHT keeps me central.  \n\nApple at (5,6) might be eaten by enemy soon anyway, so maybe target other apples: (3,0) far, (1,1) far, (4,9) far.  \n\nActually, let\u2019s check: after RIGHT to (4,5), next turn could go UP to (4,6), then RIGHT to (5,6) if apple still there. That\u2019s 2 turns. Enemy at (5,7) could go DOWN to (5,6) immediately and eat it. So maybe I shouldn\u2019t chase that apple.  \n\nInstead, maybe go DOWN to (3,4) to target apple (3,0) long-term? But that\u2019s many moves away.  \n\nGiven equal safety and mobility, I\u2019ll choose UP to get closer to top apples like (4,9) eventually and away from enemy currently at y=7.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,6), assess enemy position and apple (4,9) or (5,6) if still there. Keep central options open.\n\n---\n\nUP",

This is a possibility since (4, 6) is an apple location.\n\n*   If I move **DOWN** to (5, 5):\n    *   The enemy could move RIGHT to (4, 6) (apple) or LEFT to (2, 6) or UP to (3, 7). No head-on collision risk with (5, 5).\n\n*   If I move **RIGHT** to (6, 6):\n    *   No collision risk.\n\n**3. Strategic Evaluation**\n\nThe apple at (4, 6) is immediately reachable by moving LEFT. However, the enemy (0) is at (3, 6), right next to the apple.\n\nIf I move LEFT:\n*   I get the apple and grow, BUT I risk a head-on collision, resulting in mutual death (Score 2 vs 1, but game ends in Draw). This is a high-risk move when I have a lead (2 apples vs 1 apple, if I acquire this one).\n\nIf I move DOWN:\n*   I concede the (4, 6) apple to the enemy.\n*   I move towards (5, 0), which is a clear path.\n*   If the enemy takes (4, 6), their head moves to (4, 6), body (3, 6), tail (3, 5). My head will be at (5, 5). I retain safety.\n\nIf I move RIGHT:\n*   I concede (4, 6).\n*   I move further away from all other nearby apples (4, 9) and (5, 0). (6, 6) is safe but poor positioning.\n\n**Decision on Risk:**\nI am currently leading 1-1 (scores listed). If I take (4, 6), I lead 2-1. But if we collide, it's a draw. Safety first. I should prioritize moves that do not risk immediate death.\n\nIf I move LEFT, the enemy has a 1/3 chance (assuming equal probability for safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT) of moving RIGHT and killing us both for an apple they can easily acquire next turn anyway if I move DOWN/RIGHT. If the game considers aggressive apple collection, the enemy *should* move RIGHT.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 5), I secure my lead (1 apple) and set up for the next cluster of apples (5, 0) or (4, 9). The enemy will take (4, 6).\n\n**Long-term implications of moving DOWN to (5, 5):**\nMy head is (5, 5), body (5, 6), tail (5, 7).\nEnemy head is likely (4, 6), body (3, 6), tail (3, 5).\nNext turn (T5), I am 1 move away from (5, 4), continuing towards the large apple cluster at the bottom.\nThe enemy is centered. I will maintain good position for the lower apples, which are numerous.\n\nGiven the high risk of a head-on collision for only 1 apple when I already have a better overall position (longer snake, direct path to multiple apples), I should choose the safe route: DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

Not allowed.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 6) \u2014 empty, safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 6) \u2014 apple at (4, 6), moving onto apple is safe (grow after move).  \n\nSo DOWN is eliminated.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2014 Consider enemy possible moves and head-on collisions:**  \n\nEnemy head at (5, 6). Possible enemy moves: UP (5, 7) \u2014 its own body \u2192 death for them if they choose that, but they may not. DOWN (5, 5), LEFT (4, 6), RIGHT (6, 6).  \n\nOur safe moves: UP (3, 7), LEFT (2, 6), RIGHT (4, 6).  \n\nCheck if any of our safe moves land on same cell as enemy\u2019s possible move **this turn**:  \n- UP (3, 7): enemy can\u2019t reach in one move. Safe.  \n- LEFT (2, 6): enemy can\u2019t reach. Safe.  \n- RIGHT (4, 6): enemy could move LEFT to (4, 6) \u2192 head-on collision \u2192 both die. This is risky.  \n\nSo RIGHT is dangerous if enemy chooses LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2014 Apple proximity:**  \n\nClosest apples:  \n- (4, 6) \u2014 distance 1 from my head (right).  \n- (4, 9) \u2014 distance 3.  \n- (5, 0) \u2014 far.  \n- (3, 0) \u2014 far.  \n- (1, 1) \u2014 far.  \n\nRight gets apple immediately if no head-on collision. But enemy might also go for it.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2014 Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n\nFrom (3, 7) after UP:  \nNeighbors: UP (3, 8) free, DOWN (3, 6) \u2014 occupied by my old head? Wait, after moving UP without eating, body becomes [(3, 7), (3, 6)], tail (3, 5) disappears. So (3, 6) is my body now, so DOWN blocked. LEFT (2, 7) free, RIGHT (4, 7) free \u2192 3 free squares.  \n\nFrom (2, 6) after LEFT:  \nNeighbors: UP (2, 7) free, DOWN (2, 5) free, LEFT (1, 6) free, RIGHT (3, 6) \u2014 my body \u2192 blocked \u2192 3 free squares.  \n\nFrom (4, 6) after RIGHT (if no collision):  \nEat apple \u2192 length becomes 3, body = [(4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5)] \u2192 next turn tail stays at (3, 5)? Actually, eating means tail doesn\u2019t move, so body = [(4, 6), (3, 6), (3, 5)]. Then neighbors from (4, 6): UP (4, 7) free, DOWN (4, 5) free, LEFT (3, 6) my body, RIGHT (5, 6) enemy head currently there but could move \u2192 if enemy moves away, free; if enemy stays, dangerous. But next turn\u2019s mobility depends on enemy position.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2014 Risk assessment:**  \n\nRIGHT (4, 6): high reward (apple), but risk of head-on collision if enemy goes LEFT. Enemy\u2019s body at (5, 7), so UP into body is deadly for them, so they might avoid UP. Their safe moves: DOWN (5, 5), LEFT (4, 6), RIGHT (6, 6). They might choose LEFT to get apple (4, 6) too. That would kill us both.  \n\nUP (3, 7): safe from collision, keeps distance from enemy, but no immediate apple.  \n\nLEFT (2, 6): safe from collision, no immediate apple.  \n\nGiven my apple lead is same as enemy\u2019s (1 each), survival is key. I\u2019ll avoid risky RIGHT.  \n\nBetween UP and LEFT:  \nUP puts me closer to apple (4, 9) long-term. LEFT puts me toward board edge slightly but more central in x.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose UP for better future access to top apples and away from enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 7), check enemy\u2019s new position and remaining apples. Possibly aim for (4, 9) via (3, 8) \u2192 (4, 8) \u2192 (4, 9) if safe. Keep avoiding head-on collisions.  \n\nUP",

Move Strategy and Enemy Collision Prediction (Enemy Head at (4, 6), Body at (3, 6))**\n\nThe enemy is far up, but their head is aligned vertically with the apples at (4, 9) and horizontally with me.\n\n*   Enemy Safe Moves (from (4, 6)): UP to (4, 7), RIGHT to (5, 6), LEFT to (3, 6) [KILLS: into own body], DOWN to (4, 5).\n    *   Wait, the enemy body is at (3, 6). The enemy moved from (3, 6) -> (4, 6).\n    *   Enemy Body: (3, 6).\n    *   Enemy Safe Moves: UP to (4, 7), DOWN to (4, 5), RIGHT to (5, 6). (LEFT to 3, 6 is into their body/tail).\n\n*   **If I move DOWN to (5, 4):**\n    *   Sets up for (5, 0).\n    *   If the enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 6) (into my old tail position), they are now two moves away from me, and they block my body (5, 6). This is safe for me this turn.\n    *   If the enemy moves DOWN to (4, 5), they are adjacent to me (4, 5) vs (5, 4). This sets up a vertical race towards the bottom, but I have the faster, direct path to (5, 0).\n\n*   **If I move LEFT to (4, 5):**\n    *   This is potentially dangerous. If the enemy moves DOWN to (4, 5), it is a HEAD-ON collision, both die.\n    *   This move reduces my distance to (4, 9) or (3, 0) but risks immediate death.\n\n*   **If I move RIGHT to (6, 5):**\n    *   Safe, but moves away from all immediate apples. Poor positioning.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving LEFT to (4, 5) directly risks an unavoidable head-on collision if the enemy decides to move DOWN to (4, 5) (which is a safe and reasonable move for them as it places them closer to the center/bottom). Since the scores are tied 1-1, risking a mutual kill for marginal positional gain is not worth it, especially when I have a clear, safe path to the closest apple (5, 0).\n\nI should continue moving towards (5, 0) by selecting DOWN. Even if the enemy takes (4, 5), I am safe at (5, 4).\n\n**4. Considering Enemy Blocking (If Enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 6)):**\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 4). My body is now (5, 5), (5, 6).\nIf Enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 6). Enemy head is now on my current tail.\nNext turn (T6), my path is clear (down to (5, 3)). The enemy will be somewhat pinned against the wall/my segment (5, 5). This scenario is fine for me.\n\nThe safest and most apple-oriented move is DOWN.\n\n**Long-term Plan (T6 onwards):**\nContinue moving DOWN along the X=5 axis to capture (5, 0). Once (5, 0) is acquired, pivot towards (3, 0) or (1, 1), or depending on the enemy position, move UP towards (4, 9).\n\nDOWN",

UP moves toward less contested area (top row) and away from enemy at (5, 5). LEFT goes near edge but not toward many apples. RIGHT moves closer to enemy and contested apple (4, 6).\n\nBest choice: **UP** for safety and keeping options open.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 8), check enemy position.

Direct path to a high-value apple.\n    *   If Enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 8): Safe.\n    *   If Enemy moves UP to (3, 9): Safe.\n    *   If Enemy moves LEFT to (2, 8): Safe.\n    *   No risk of collision this turn.\n\n*   **Priority 2: (4, 6) via LEFT.**\n    *   If I move LEFT to (4, 4).\n    *   This positions me for a fight for (4, 6) (M=2 from (4, 4)) or (4, 9) (M=5 from (4, 4)).\n    *   If the Enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 8): The enemy gets closer to (4, 9) but is still 4 units away from me.\n\nI currently have one less safe path (UP is blocked). Staying on the X=5 column and moving DOWN is the safest choice, isolating myself from the enemy and securing an apple that is geographically distant from the enemy's current location. The enemy is extremely high up (Y=8), and I am mid-board (Y=4). I should focus on the bottom apples first.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will proceed DOWN to (5, 3), then (5, 2), (5, 1), and eat (5, 0) on Turn 10. This is a five-turn acquisition.\nAfter securing (5, 0), I will assess if the enemy has moved to the center to protect (3, 0) or (1, 1). If not, I will pivot left.\n\nThe move DOWN is optimal for safety and apple acquisition.\n\nDOWN",

Safe.  \n- LEFT (2, 8): enemy can\u2019t reach. Safe.  \n- RIGHT (4, 8): enemy can\u2019t reach in 1 move from (5, 4). Safe.  \n\nSo no immediate head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2014 Apple proximity:**  \n\nFrom (3, 8):  \n- Closest apple: (4, 9) at distance 2 (right then up).  \n- (4, 6) at distance 3 (right then down then down).  \nOthers far.  \n\nRIGHT gets me closer to both (4, 9) and (4, 6).  \nUP moves toward (4, 9) but also toward top edge.  \nLEFT moves away from apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2014 Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n\nAfter **UP (3, 9)**:  \nNeighbors: UP off board \u2192 death, DOWN (3, 8) \u2014 my old head? Wait, after moving without eating, body becomes [(3, 9), (3, 8)], so (3, 8) is my body \u2192 DOWN blocked. LEFT (2, 9) free, RIGHT (4, 9) apple \u2192 if I eat it, I grow, so next turn after eating, tail stays same length but head moves to apple cell. But immediate next turn mobility after UP: only LEFT and RIGHT possible (2 free squares), DOWN blocked by my body.  \n\nAfter **LEFT (2, 8)**:  \nNeighbors: UP (2, 9) free, DOWN (2, 7) free, LEFT (1, 8) free, RIGHT (3, 8) \u2014 my body \u2192 blocked \u2192 3 free squares.  \n\nAfter **RIGHT (4, 8)**:  \nNeighbors: UP (4, 9) apple (eating gives growth), DOWN (4, 7) free, LEFT (3, 8) \u2014 my body \u2192 blocked, RIGHT (5, 8) free \u2192 3 free squares.  \n\nSo UP leads to fewer immediate safe moves next turn (2) unless I eat apple, but apple is not at (3, 9). So UP is riskier for future mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2014 Risk from enemy next turn:**  \n\nEnemy at (5, 4) might go for (4, 6) apple via LEFT to (4, 4) then UP, or DOWN then LEFT. If I go RIGHT to (4, 8), next turn I could go UP to (4, 9) apple or DOWN to (4, 7). Enemy not likely to reach (4, 9) before me if I move RIGHT now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2014 Decision:**  \n\nLEFT gives safe mobility but away from apples.  \nRIGHT gives good apple access (closest apple (4, 9) reachable next turn) and keeps 3 free squares next turn.  \nUP reduces mobility and puts me on top edge.  \n\nBest choice seems **RIGHT** to approach (4, 9) apple while keeping options open and avoiding enemy\u2019s immediate path.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 8), if enemy not threatening (4, 9), go UP to eat it. If enemy could reach (4, 9) same turn, avoid head-on collision by going DOWN or LEFT instead.  \n\nRIGHT",

This is now closer than (5, 0).\n    *   However, moving LEFT might trigger a race for (4, 6) with the enemy, who is likely moving down to (4, 7) or eating (4, 9). Given the enemy's position at (4, 8), they are highly competitive for Y-axis apples.\n\nI need 3 more moves to get (5, 0) (current: (5, 3) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 0)).\nIf I abandon (5, 0) and go LEFT, I risk a tougher fight for the central apples, especially if the enemy secures (4, 9) and subsequently focuses on (4, 6). Maintaining the high-safety path seems best while the enemy is busy high on the board.\n\nI stick with the plan to move DOWN.\n\n**Long-term Plan (T7+):**\nContinue moving DOWN: (5, 3) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 0).

The intended path is LEFT to (4, 0), then LEFT to (3, 0) (EAT).\n\n*   My move: LEFT to (4, 0).\n\n*   **Enemy Prediction:** Snake 0 is at (3, 6). They are equidistant (M=3) from the two northern apples (3, 9) and (4, 9). They are also relatively close to (4, 1) (M=5).\n    *   If Snake 0 aims for the north: (3, 6) -> UP/RIGHT/LEFT.\n    *   If Snake 0 aims for the south/middle: (3, 6) -> DOWN.\n\n    Since Snake 0 is still relatively high, they are likely moving UP or keeping x-coordinate stability to secure a northern apple, or perhaps moving aggressively towards the center/south.\n\n    Possible safe moves for 0: UP to (3, 7), DOWN to (3, 5), LEFT to (2, 6), RIGHT to (4, 6) (KILLS: body). Assuming they move UP to (3, 7).\n\n*   **Collision Check:**\n    *   My Head moves to (4, 0).\n    *   Enemy Head is high up (3, 6). No collision risk.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nMoving LEFT to (4, 0) sets me up perfectly to consume the apple at (3, 0) on the next turn, maintaining pressure on the score.\n\n**Long-term Plan (T11+):**\nT11: LEFT to (3, 0) (EAT). Length 4.\nT12 onwards: Target the apple at (4, 1) or (1, 1). After eating (3, 0), my head is at (3, 0). (4, 1) is 2 moves: UP, RIGHT (or RIGHT, UP). (1, 1) is 3 moves: RIGHT, UP, UP. (Wait, (1, 1) is 3 moves: UP to (3, 1), LEFT to (2, 1), LEFT to (1, 1)). (4, 1) is closer. I will head towards (4, 1). (3, 0) -> (3, 1) -> (4, 1) (EAT).\n\nLEFT",

Moving DOWN gets me closer to apples (3, 0) and (1, 1), which enemy is not near.  \nLEFT also moves toward (1, 1) but keeps me at same y-level; DOWN reduces y distance to those bottom apples faster.  \n\nGiven my tail will disappear next turn, I can afford to move DOWN to get into open bottom area, then approach (3, 0) or (1, 1) safely.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 5), body will be [(3, 6), (4, 6)], enemy possibly at (4, 0) or (6, 0). I can then move DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT to continue toward bottom-left apples while avoiding potential future enemy path up the left side.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nDOWN seems best to reduce distance to uncontested apples quickly while keeping options open.  \n\nDOWN",

Apple Evaluation & Target Selection**\n\n1.  (3, 0): Distance 1 (Left). **(Primary Target)**\n2.  (4, 1): Distance 1 (Up).\n3.  (1, 1): Distance 3.\n4.  (4, 9): Distance 9.\n5.  (3, 9): Distance 10.\n\n*   Moving LEFT eats the apple at (3, 0).\n*   Moving UP eats the apple at (4, 1).\n\nBoth moves are equally good in terms of immediate reward. However, (3, 0) utilizes horizontal space which is less constrained by my current body position (which is mostly to the right at x=5), potentially leading to a safer exit path.\n\n**Path A: LEFT to (3, 0) [EAT]**\n*   Head ends at (3, 0).\n*   New tail will be (5, 0).\n*   Next target is (4, 1) (2 moves: R, U).\n\n**Path B: UP to (4, 1) [EAT]**\n*   Head ends at (4, 1).\n*   New tail will be (5, 0).\n*   Next target is (3, 0) (1 move: L) or (1, 1) (2 moves: L, L).\n\nPath B (UP) seems slightly strategically better because after eating (4, 1), I have the option to immediately pivot LEFT to grab (3, 0) next turn (if it's not taken), or go for (1, 1).\n\n**3. Enemy Collision Prediction (Snake #0 at (3, 5))**\n\nSnake #0 is at (3, 5). Body is at (3, 6), (4, 6).\nSafe moves for 0: UP to (3, 6) (KILLS: body/backwards? No, (3, 6) is body, so it KILLS 0), DOWN to (3, 4), LEFT to (2, 5). Right to (4, 5).\n*   0 cannot move UP to (3, 6) (collision with own body/segment behind the head).\n*   Safe moves for 0: DOWN (3, 4), LEFT (2, 5), RIGHT (4, 5).\n\n*   If 0 moves DOWN to (3, 4), they are not near me.\n*   If 0 moves LEFT to (2, 5), they are not near me.\n*   If 0 moves RIGHT to (4, 5), they are moving toward the center.\n\nMy potential head positions: (3, 0) or (4, 1). There is no collision risk regardless of 0's move, as they are 4+ cells away.\n\n**4. Final Decision Rationale**\n\nChoosing UP to (4, 1). This apple is slightly higher up the board, and after eating it, the transition to the next closest apple is favorable:\nT11: UP to (4, 1) [EAT]\nT12: Then I can try LEFT to (3, 1), or DOWN to (4, 0) and LEFT to (3, 0). Since (3, 0) might still be there, and (1, 1) is also accessible.\n\nIf I chose LEFT to (3, 0):\nT11: LEFT to (3, 0) [EAT]\nT12: I am stuck at the wall. I then have to go UP to (3, 1) and RIGHT to (4, 1) (if available) or LEFT towards (1, 1).\n\nBoth moves are excellent. I will choose UP to (4, 1) to gain elevation and put the apple at (3, 0) into a favorable corner access position for the next turn, allowing for quick horizontal and vertical movement options.\n\n**Long-term Plan (T12+):**\nT12: If (3, 0) is still available, go for it (DOWN, LEFT, or just LEFT/DOWN depending on head exit strategy). If not, target (1, 1).\n\nUP",

Since my length is 4, (5, 1) is the last segment. If I *don't* eat an apple, (5, 1) will be empty next turn, UNLESS I move (5, 1) is currently my tail. Moving RIGHT to (5, 1) means I move into my current tail position. Since I did NOT eat an apple two turns ago, my tail moves.\n    *   T11: Moved UP, ate apple. Body grew. New tail is (5, 0).\n    *   My current body is: (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1). Tail is (5, 1).\n    *   If I move RIGHT to (5, 1), the cell (5, 1) will be empty *after* the move, but it is currently occupied. Moving into a current tail cell is only safe if I *don't* grow (or if the tail cell is vacated). Wait, since I grew last turn, my T10 tail (5, 1) is still part of my body list. My T12 tail will be (5, 0).\n    *   T12 Body Check: (4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1).\n    *   Moving R to (5, 1) is moving into a standing body segment. **KILLS ME.**\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT.\n\n**2. Apple Evaluation & Target Selection**\n\n1.  (3, 0): Distance 2. (L, D). **(Primary Target)**\n2.  (1, 1): Distance 3. (L, L).\n3.  (4, 9): Distance 8.\n4.  (3, 9): Distance 9.\n5.  (5, 9): Distance 9.\n\nI must choose between UP (4, 2) or LEFT (3, 1).\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (3, 1):** This sets up a perfect capture of (3, 0) next turn (move DOWN). This is highly efficient. Distance to (3, 0) is now 1.\n*   **Move UP to (4, 2):** This moves me away from the closest apple (3, 0). Distance to (3, 0) becomes 3 (D, D, L). This is suboptimal, although it provides vertical freedom.\n\nMoving LEFT to (3, 1) is clearly the best path for apple maximization.\n\n**3. Enemy Collision Prediction (Snake #0 at (2, 5))**\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 5). Body is at (3, 5), (3, 6).\nSafe moves for 0:\n*   UP to (2, 6): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (2, 4): Safe.\n*   LEFT to (1, 5): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (3, 5): KILLS 0 (into body).\n\n0's moves are far away from me (My head is at (4, 1)). No immediate risk of collision.\n\n**4. Final Decision Rationale**\nMove LEFT to (3, 1). This maneuvers me into position to grab the apple at (3, 0) next turn by moving DOWN. If I move UP now, I make the retrieval of (3, 0) inefficient.\n\n**Long-term Plan (T13+):**\nT13: Move DOWN to (3, 0) [EAT apple].\nT14: Move LEFT to (2, 0) or UP to (3, 1) if necessary to reach (1, 1) later.\n\nLEFT",

Apple Evaluation & Target Selection**\n\nThe only safe move is LEFT to (2, 0).\n\nThe target apple is (1, 1).\nCurrent head: (3, 0).\nDistance to (1, 1): 1 horizontal (to 2, 0) + 1 horizontal (to 1, 0) + 1 vertical (to 1, 1). Minimum distance 3.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 0):\nNext turn (T15), possible moves:\n1. UP to (2, 1): Safe.\n2. LEFT to (1, 0): Safe.\n\nFrom (2, 0), moving LEFT to (1, 0) and then UP to (1, 1) seems the most direct path to the apple (1, 1).\n\n**3. Enemy Collision Prediction (Snake #0 at (1, 4))**\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 4). Body is at (1, 5), (2, 5).\nPotential moves for 0: UP (1, 5 - KILLS 0), DOWN (1, 3), LEFT (0, 4), RIGHT (2, 4).\nSnake 0 has killed itself by moving into (1, 5) in a previous prediction mistake. Correct body is (1, 5) and (2, 5).\n\nWait, let's recheck the enemy body state:\nSnake #0 - Head: (1, 4), Body: [(1, 5), (2, 5)]\n\n*   UP to (1, 5): KILLS Snake 0 (moves into its body segment (1, 5)). **KILLED.**\n*   DOWN to (1, 3): Safe.\n*   LEFT to (0, 4): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (2, 4): Safe.\n\nSnake 0 is far away from (3, 0). My move LEFT to (2, 0) brings me closer to the area where Snake 0 *might* approach (e.g., if Snake 0 targets the apple (1, 1)).\n\nIf Snake 0 moves DOWN to (1, 3) or LEFT to (0, 4), it is moving away from the (1, 1) apple. If Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (2, 4), it approaches the center but is still far from the bottom lane.\n\nSince I am forced to move LEFT, there is no collision risk this turn.\n\n**4. Final Decision Rationale**\nThe only safe move is LEFT, moving from (3, 0) to (2, 0), which sets me up to capture the apple at (1, 1) on turn T16 or T17.\n\n**Long-term Plan (T15+):**\nT15: Head at (2, 0). Move LEFT to (1, 0).\nT16: Head at (1, 0). Move UP to (1, 1) to eat the apple.\n\nLEFT",

That puts enemy further from apple (1, 1) than me.  \nApple (1, 1) is two steps away if I go DOWN twice: (1, 4) \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 (1, 1).  \nEnemy could move toward (1, 1) later, but right now they\u2019re far and trapped near bottom left.  \nApple (5, 5) is also an option but farther.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2014 Choose between DOWN and RIGHT:**  \nBoth give 3 safe moves next turn.  \nDOWN gets me closer to nearest apple (1, 1).  \nRIGHT moves toward center but not closer to any apple than DOWN does to (1, 1).  \nEnemy at (2, 0) next turn could move UP to (2, 1), which is one step from (1, 1), but I\u2019d be at (1, 3) \u2192 still closer.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 3), body [(1, 4), (1, 5)], aim for (1, 1) via (1, 2) if possible, but check enemy\u2019s position first.

Both are equally good for acquisition.\n\n**3. Conflict Prediction (Snake #0 at (1, 3))**\n\nSnake 0 is at (1, 3). Body: [(1, 4), (1, 5)].\nPossible moves for Snake 0 (safe moves):\n1. UP to (1, 4): KILLS Snake 0 (moves into its body segment (1, 4)). **KILLED.**\n2. DOWN to (1, 2): Safe.\n3. LEFT to (0, 3): Safe.\n4. RIGHT to (2, 3): Safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 0) and Snake 0 moves DOWN to (1, 2), we are close in the same column.\n(1, 0) is 2 squares from (1, 2).\nIf I move UP to (2, 1) and Snake 0 moves DOWN to (1, 2), we are separate.\n\n*   Scenario A: I move LEFT to (1, 0).\n    *   Next turn T16, I will want to move UP to (1, 1) to eat A1.\n    *   If Snake 0 moves DOWN to (1, 2), it blocks my target move (1, 1) on T16, by potentially moving into (1, 1) itself, or by moving to (1, 2) and trying to block my movement space.\n\nLet's analyze Snake 0's incentives. Apple A1 (1, 1) is 2 moves away (e.g., DOWN to (1, 2), then RIGHT/LEFT/DOWN is impossible, wait...).\n\nFrom (1, 3):\nIf 0 moves (1, 3) -> (1, 2) (DOWN), it is 1 move away from A1 (1, 1).\nIf 0 moves (1, 3) -> (0, 3) (LEFT), it is 1 move away from (0, 2) or (0, 1). Not directly targeting A1.\nIf 0 moves (1, 3) -> (2, 3) (RIGHT), it is 1 move away from (2, 2) or (2, 1).\n\nSnake 0's most tempting move is likely DOWN to (1, 2) to intercept A1 (1, 1).\n\nIf Snake 0 chooses DOWN to (1, 2):\n*   If I move LEFT to (1, 0): I am at (1, 0). On T16, 0 is at (1, 2). I can move UP to (1, 1) and eat A1. Collision risk? No, 0 needs 1 more move to reach (1, 1). If 0 is at (1, 2), it can move DOWN to (1, 1) on T16.\n    *   **HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK!** If I move LEFT to (1, 0) and 0 moves DOWN to (1, 2), we both can go to (1, 1) on T16. Deadly!\n\n*   If I move UP to (2, 1): I am at (2, 1). 0 is at (1, 2).\n    *   T16: I move LEFT to (1, 1) and eat A1.\n    *   T16: 0 moves DOWN to (1, 1).\n    *   **HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK!** If I move UP to (2, 1) and 0 moves DOWN to (1, 2), we both can go to (1, 1) on T16. Deadly!\n\n**Recalculating Minimum Distance to (1, 1):**\n\n*   My position (2, 0).\n    *   1 move LEFT to (1, 0), then 1 move UP to (1, 1). Total 2 moves.\n    *   1 move UP to (2, 1), then 1 move LEFT to (1, 1). Total 2 moves.\n*   Snake 0 position (1, 3).\n    *   1 move DOWN to (1, 2), then 1 move DOWN to (1, 1). Total 2 moves.\n\nBecause both snakes are exactly 2 moves away, there is a very high risk of a head-on collision at (1, 1) on T16 if both snakes prioritize this apple.\n\n**How to avoid T16 collision while securing the apple?**\nI need to make a blocking move or force the enemy to choose another apple, or choose a path that forces them into a slower route or danger. Since all moves lead to a T16 clash, I must consider which move gives me better options if the enemy deviates.\n\nSince the board is 10x10 and apples are scattered, perhaps one of us will choose a distant apple, but (1, 1) is the closest for both.\n\nLet's assume Snake 0 is greedy and goes for (1, 1) by moving DOWN to (1, 2).\n\n1.  If I move LEFT to (1, 0):\n    *   If 0 moves DOWN to (1, 2). T16 collision at (1, 1). (Death for both, and 0 wins due to tie-breaker rule if all die, which is not possible here as the game generally continues if they die, unless they are the last two remaining. If we both die, the game ends immediately and the snake with the most apples wins. I have 4, Snake 0 has 2. I win if we both die! But this is not the primary goal.)\n\n2.  If I move UP to (2, 1):\n    *   If 0 moves DOWN to (1, 2). T16 collision at (1, 1). (I win the overall game if we both die, but I want to stay alive.)\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Avoid (1, 1) and go for (5, 5).**\nApple A5 is at (5, 5).\nFrom (2, 0) to (5, 5). Distance: 3 horizontal + 5 vertical = 8 moves. This is quite far.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Look for apples in the top row (9).**\nA2 (4, 9), A3 (3, 9), A4 (5, 9). Distance: 2-3 horizontal + 9 vertical = 11-12 moves. Even farther.\n\nGiven the apple (1, 1) is right here, and Snake 0 is also close, I must either try to claim it safely or concede it.\n\n**Can I block 0?**\nIf 0 moves RIGHT to (2, 3), it will be 2 moves away from (1, 1) (via (2, 2) or (1, 2)).\nIf 0 moves LEFT to (0, 3), it is 3 moves away from (1, 1).\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 1).\nIf 0 moves RIGHT to (2, 3).\nT16: I move LEFT to (1, 1) (Eat). 0 moves DOWN to (2, 2). Safe. This is good for me.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 0).\nIf 0 moves RIGHT to (2, 3).\nT16: I move UP to (1, 1) (Eat). 0 moves DOWN to (2, 2). Safe. This is also good for me.\n\nSnake 0 is heavily incentivized to move DOWN to (1, 2). If 0 moves DOWN, the head-on collision is certain on T16 regardless of whether I choose UP or LEFT.\n\n**Strategic Choice:** Since I have more apples (4 vs 2), if a head-on collision is unavoidable, I technically win the game if both snakes die. However, staying alive is paramount.\n\nIs there any reason 0 wouldn't move DOWN?\n(1, 4) is 0's body. If 0 moves DOWN, its body becomes [(1, 3), (1, 4)]. The space (1, 5) frees up.\n(1, 2) is safe for 0.\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 1):\nThis keeps me away from the wall and gives me a wider corridor access. If 0 unexpectedly moves (2, 3), I am better positioned for movement options. Specifically, (2, 1) allows choices: LEFT (to apple), UP (to 2, 2), RIGHT (to 3, 1 - KILLED by my body). Oops, (3, 1) is my body segment.\n\nMy body segments: (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 0).\n\n*   From (2, 1):\n    *   LEFT to (1, 1): Apple/Collision\n    *   UP to (2, 2): Safe.\n    *   RIGHT to (3, 1): KILLS ME! (Into my body Segment) **KILLED.**\n    *   DOWN to (2, 0): Safe (Back to previous head spot, but body moves).\n\nIf I choose UP (2, 1), then on T16 I only have LEFT/UP/DOWN. If I can't risk LEFT, then I am forced UP or DOWN, delaying the apple capture and risking being trapped by my own body (3, 1).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 0):\n*   From (1, 0):\n    *   UP to (1, 1): Apple/Collision\n    *   LEFT to (0, 0): Safe.\n    *   RIGHT to (2, 0): Safe (Previous head spot).\n    *   DOWN to (1, -1): KILLS ME (Off board). **KILLED.**\n\n(1, 0) offers two directions to escape: LEFT to (0, 0) or RIGHT to (2, 0).\n(2, 1) offers two directions to escape: UP to (2, 2) or DOWN to (2, 0). But it is right next to my body (3, 1).\n\nIf Snake 0 moves DOWN to (1, 2), both my moves are precarious for T16 if I go for the apple.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 0) and decide to bail on the apple if 0 pursues it, I can move LEFT to (0, 0) on T16.\nIf 0 moves DOWN to (1, 2) on T15, and on T16 0 moves DOWN to (1, 1) (eats apple). I move LEFT to (0, 0).\nThis seems safer, although it concedes the apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 1) and decide to bail, I can move UP to (2, 2) on T16. This keeps me centrally located.\n\nLet's assume the enemy will try to get the apple.\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 0), I am near the corner.\nIf I move UP to (2, 1), I am more central. (2, 1) is a 2-way street (excluding apple direction and body collision). (1, 0) is also a 2-way street (excluding apple direction).\n\nThe geometry:\n(2, 1) has my body at (3, 1). Blocking rightward movement.\n(1, 0) has the boundary at (0, 0) but that is safe. The whole bottom row is open for movement (0, 0) up to (1, 0) up to (2, 0).\n\nMoving LEFT to (1, 0) seems slightly safer for escape if 0 takes the apple, as I can move into the corner (0, 0).\n\nMoving UP to (2, 1) gives me better verticality if I need to start climbing towards the top apples (like (5, 5)).\n\nGiven my lead (4 apples vs 2), I don't necessarily need to risk a 50/50 collision. Conceding the apple (1, 1) might be wise if Snake 0 commits to it.\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 1), and 0 moves DOWN to (1, 2).\nT16: 0 moves (1, 1) (Eats). I move UP to (2, 2). I am safe, and positioned for (5, 5).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 0), and 0 moves DOWN to (1, 2).\nT16: 0 moves (1, 1) (Eats). I move RIGHT to (2, 0) or LEFT to (0, 0). I am safe, but remain very low on the board and further from other apples.\n\nI prefer moving UP to (2, 1) to maintain better board coverage and access to other valuable apples like (5, 5) or the cluster on row 9, especially since the apple (1, 1) appears highly contested. I will concede (1, 1) this turn by planning to move away on T16 if 0 closes in.\n\n**Plan:** Move UP to (2, 1). If 0 moves to (1, 2) (T15), I will move UP to (2, 2) on T16, letting 0 have the apple (1, 1).\n\n**T15 Move:** UP\n\n**START LONG TERM PLAN**\nCurrent analysis suggests apple (1, 1) is highly contested by Snake 0. Since both snakes are 2 moves away, a T16 head-on collision is likely if both pursue it. Given my apple lead (4 vs 2), I will prioritize survival and future positioning. I move UP to (2, 1) this turn, setting me up to move UP to (2, 2) on T16 if Snake 0 pursues (1, 1) by moving to (1, 2) this turn. This will position me better to pivot towards apple (5, 5) or the top row cluster.\n**END LONG TERM PLAN**\n\nUP",

Goal Evaluation**\n\nThe closest apple is A1 at (1, 1). Moving LEFT (1, 1) eats the apple, increasing my score to 5 and length to 6. This is the optimal move if it is safe.\n\n**3. Collision Risk (Left to (1, 1))**\n\nMy target is (1, 1). Is Snake 0 also targeting (1, 1)?\nSnake 0 is at (2, 3).\n*   Path 1: DOWN to (2, 2), DOWN to (2, 1), LEFT to (1, 1). (3 moves minimum to reach the apple).\n*   Path 2: LEFT to (1, 3), DOWN to (1, 2), DOWN to (1, 1). (3 moves minimum).\n\nSince I am 1 move away and Snake 0 is 3 moves away, moving LEFT to (1, 1) is safe and guarantees an apple capture.\n\n**4. Alternative Moves (UP to (2, 2))**\nMoving UP to (2, 2) delays the apple capture by 1 turn, and 0 still cannot reach (1, 1) unless it teleports. This move is strictly inferior to capturing the apple.\n\n**Decision:** Move LEFT to (1, 1) to eat the apple safely.\n\n**Long Term Plan:**\nAfter eating A1 at (1, 1), my new head will be (1, 1), and my length will increase to 6 (body segments: (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1)). The tail (4, 1) is maintained. Snake 0 is still positioned somewhat centrally at (2, 3). The next closest apple is A5 at (5, 5). I should start moving vertically and horizontally towards (5, 5). From (1, 1), potential routes include climbing up the left side (y=9) or moving rightward toward the center. Given the other apples are far away, (5, 5) seems like the best target.\n\nLEFT",

Safe? Need to consider enemy\u2019s possible moves.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2, 2): Empty in board state? From board: row 2, col 2 is empty. But enemy\u2019s head at (2, 1) could move UP to (2, 2) \u2014 possible head-on collision if both choose that. Also enemy could move LEFT to (1, 1) or RIGHT to (3, 1), but (2, 2) itself is safe from static bodies.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1, 3): That\u2019s my own body segment (from board: row 3 col 1 is \u2018T\u2019 = my tail). Actually, body list says (1, 3) is second segment. So moving LEFT would crash into myself.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3, 3): Empty on board. Safe?  \n\nSo **LEFT** is immediately fatal (into own body).  \n\n**Check board boundaries:** All within 0\u20139.  \n\n**Now consider enemy\u2019s possible moves from (2, 1):**  \nEnemy body: (2, 0) tail, (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1).  \nEnemy can\u2019t go DOWN (2, 0) is its own body? Wait, (2, 0) is its neck (second segment). Actually body: head (2, 1), then (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1). So DOWN to (2, 0) is into its own body \u2192 fatal for them. So enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP to (2, 2), LEFT to (1, 1), RIGHT to (3, 1).  \n\nIf enemy goes UP to (2, 2), and I go DOWN to (2, 2), head-on collision. That\u2019s risky.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (1, 1), safe for me if I go DOWN? No head-on then.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (3, 1), safe for me if I go DOWN? Yes.  \n\nBut I can\u2019t know which they\u2019ll pick.  \n\n**Avoid risky collisions:**  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 2): possible head-on if enemy goes UP.  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 4): enemy can\u2019t reach (2, 4) in one move. Safe from collision.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 3): enemy can\u2019t reach (3, 3) in one move. Safe from collision.  \n\nSo UP and RIGHT are collision-safe regardless of enemy move.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple: (1, 1) is 2 moves away if I go DOWN then LEFT, but that\u2019s risky path (enemy near).  \nApple at (5, 5) is 4 moves away (Manhattan distance).  \nApples at top row: far.  \n\nBetter to stay alive and grow gradually.  \n\n**Future mobility:**  \nFrom (2, 4): possible next moves: UP (2,5), DOWN (2,3) my old head position? That\u2019s empty now? Wait, after I move, my body shifts: head to (2,4), neck at (2,3), tail at (1,3), tail end at (1,4) will move next turn? Actually body length 3: head new pos, then old head (2,3) becomes neck, old neck (1,3) becomes tail, old tail (1,4) disappears. So (1,4) becomes free. So from (2,4), safe moves next turn: check adjacent: (2,5), (3,4), (1,4), (2,3). But (2,3) is my neck next turn \u2014 can\u2019t go back into neck. So UP, RIGHT, LEFT may be safe depending on enemy.  \n\nFrom (3,3): adjacent: (3,4), (4,3), (2,3) my neck, (3,2). So three possible safe moves likely.  \n\nBoth UP and RIGHT keep options open.  \n\n**Enemy\u2019s likely move:** Enemy might go for apple at (1,1) by moving LEFT to (1,1) and eat it. If so, they grow, tail stays longer. Then they\u2019ll be at (1,1) with length 6. That apple disappears if they eat it.  \n\nIf they go UP to (2,2), they\u2019re closer to me but no apple there.  \n\nGiven they have 4 apples, maybe they\u2019ll go for (1,1).  \n\n**My choice:**  \nUP to (2,4) or RIGHT to (3,3).  \nUP gets me slightly closer to top apples long-term. RIGHT moves toward center and (5,5).  \nI think RIGHT is slightly better because:  \n- From (3,3), I can go to (4,3) then (5,3) then (5,4) then (5,5) in 4 moves, avoiding enemy path.  \n- From (2,4), path to (5,5) is longer.  \n\nLet\u2019s choose **RIGHT**.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (3,3), check enemy\u2019s new head position. Avoid moving into (3,2) if enemy could be there. Likely go UP to (3,4) or RIGHT to (4,3) to approach (5,5).  \n\nRIGHT",

Goal Evaluation**\n\nThere is a new apple at A5 at (0, 2).\n*   Distance from (1, 1) to (0, 2): 1 move (LEFT to (0, 1), then UP to (0, 2)) OR (UP to (1, 2), then LEFT to (0, 2)). Wait, distance is diagonal 1, so 1 move LEFT then 1 move UP, or 1 move UP then 1 move LEFT (2 moves).\n*   Wait, let's re-examine the coordinates. (1, 1) to (0, 2).\n    *   Move LEFT: (0, 1). Then Move UP: (0, 2). Total 2 moves.\n\nThe closest apple is A5 at (5, 5).\n*   Distance to (5, 5): 4 steps right, 4 steps up. Manhattan distance 8.\n\nLet's check the new apple A at (0, 2).\n*   (1, 1) -> UP -> (1, 2). Then move LEFT -> (0, 2) (Apple). Total 2 moves.\n*   (1, 1) -> LEFT -> (0, 1). Then move UP -> (0, 2) (Apple). Total 2 moves.\n\nI need a move that sets me up to grab (0, 2) on turn 19.\n\n**Option A: Move UP to (1, 2).** (Targets apple (0, 2) next turn via LEFT).\n**Option B: Move LEFT to (0, 1).** (Targets apple (0, 2) next turn via UP).\n**Option C: Move DOWN to (1, 0).** (Moves away from all apples).\n\nBoth A and B aim for the apple at (0, 2). Let's evaluate potential collisions.\n\nEnemy Snake 0 Head is at (3, 3).\nTo reach (0, 2):\n(3, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (0, 3) -> (0, 2). Minimum 4 moves. No collision risk capturing (0, 2).\n\n**3. Comparison of Safe Moves (UP vs LEFT)**\n\nWe need to consider if moving UP or LEFT leads to a safer or better strategic position for the future (1, 2) vs (0, 1).\n\n*   **If I move UP to (1, 2):**\n    *   Next turn I can move LEFT to (0, 2) (Apple).\n    *   Other moves from (1, 2): UP (1, 3 - blocked by T0), RIGHT (2, 2).\n    *   At (1, 2), I am 1 spot away from the enemy's body segment (1, 3). If snake 0 moves to (2, 2) or (3, 2), I am safe.\n*   **If I move LEFT to (0, 1):**\n    *   Next turn I can move UP to (0, 2) (Apple).\n    *   Other moves from (0, 1): UP (0, 2, Apple), DOWN (0, 0), RIGHT (1, 1, blocked by my body).\n    *   At (0, 1), I am against the border.\n\nMoving LEFT to (0, 1) seems slightly more restrictive as I hit the x=0 border, but it gives me a clear path to the apple (0, 2) next turn (Move UP).\n\nMoving UP to (1, 2) also gives a clear path to the apple (0, 2) next turn (Move LEFT). It also keeps me off the absolute border for movement (0, 1). However, (1, 3) is segment T0/B0, which could block me if snake 0 makes an aggressive move.\n\nLet's look at Snake 0 (3, 3). Snake 0 is likely trying to move towards the cluster of apples (4, 9), (3, 9), (5, 9) or maybe (5, 5).\nPossible moves for 0 from (3, 3):\n1. UP to (3, 4). (Moves toward (5, 5) or high apples). Safe.\n2. DOWN to (3, 2). Safe.\n3. LEFT to (2, 3). Kills 0 (into its own body).\n4. RIGHT to (4, 3). Safe.\n\nIf 0 moves UP to (3, 4) or RIGHT to (4, 3), it moves away from us.\nIf 0 moves DOWN to (3, 2), it maintains proximity but isn't a threat to (1, 2) or (0, 1).\n\nThe move UP to (1, 2) sets me up against the enemy body at (1, 3). If Snake 0 attempts to move to (2, 3) (which is its body right now, but will potentially be empty if 0 moves away, or if 0 moves down/up/right, (2, 3) becomes its new tail/body segment) \u2014 Wait, the enemy body is [(2, 3), (1, 3)]. If 0 moves, its new tail will be (1, 3) if it doesn't eat, or if it does eat, (1, 3) remains a body segment.\n\nSince 0 did not eat last turn, its tail (1, 3) *will* shrink and become available if 0 moves safely.\n\n**Let's assume 0 moves UP to (3, 4) (best move for 0 to target high apples):**\nT=18:\nMe: (1, 1) -> (1, 2) [UP]\n0: (3, 3) -> (3, 4) [UP]\nNew 0 segments: Head (3, 4). Body [(3, 3), (2, 3)]. Tail (1, 3) is free.\n\nIf I move UP to (1, 2), the space (1, 3) becomes free. I can use this space later, but it doesn't help me get the apple (0, 2).\n\n**Let's compare (1, 2) vs (0, 1) again as T=18 head positions, targeting (0, 2) at T=19.**\n\n1. **Move UP to (1, 2):**\n   *   T=19 target: LEFT to (0, 2) (Apple). Safe.\n   *   Future flexibility: (1, 3) is free now. I could move UP again if needed.\n\n2. **Move LEFT to (0, 1):**\n   *   T=19 target: UP to (0, 2) (Apple). Safe.\n   *   Future flexibility: (1, 1) is blocked by my body segment (2, 1). I am restricted to (0, 0), (0, 2+), or (1, 1) if my body clears.\n\n(1, 2) offers slightly better central positioning and more freedom away from the corner/wall (0, 1). I want to maintain mobility to go right toward (5, 5) after eating (0, 2).\n\nFrom (1, 2) -> (0, 2), my new segments are: Head (0, 2). Body [(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1)].\nFrom (0, 1) -> (0, 2), my new segments are: Head (0, 2). Body [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1)]. (Slight difference in body order, but same cells occupied).\n\nIf I move UP to (1, 2):\nMy new head is (1, 2). My old head (1, 1) becomes body segment 2. My body trail is getting closer to the path I need to take toward the center/right.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 1):\nMy new head is (0, 1). My old head (1, 1) becomes body segment 2. This keeps the path rightward toward (2, 1) and beyond clearer for longer movements after I eat the apple.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 1), the cell (1, 2) remains open.\nIf I move UP to (1, 2), the cell (0, 1) remains open.\n\nBoth choices are safe and lead to the apple (0, 2) next turn (T=19). I choose UP because it keeps me slightly more central and closer to opening up the space previously occupied by O's tail (1, 3). Given O is likely moving UP/RIGHT, this is the safer general area.\n\n**Long Term Plan:**\n1. Move UP to (1, 2).\n2. T=19: Move LEFT to (0, 2), eat apple.\n3. T=20 onwards: Turn right/up, move towards (5, 5).\n\nUP",

Not allowed.  \n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 3) \u2013 empty on board.  \n\nSo **LEFT** is immediately fatal.  \n\nNow check for **possible head-on collisions** with enemy\u2019s possible moves from (1, 1).  \n\nEnemy\u2019s body: (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1).  \n\nEnemy safe moves:  \n- UP to (1, 2) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN to (1, 0) \u2013 empty.  \n- LEFT to (0, 1) \u2013 empty.  \n- RIGHT to (2, 1) \u2013 that\u2019s its own neck, so not allowed.  \n\nSo enemy can\u2019t go RIGHT. They can go UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\nNow compare with my safe moves:  \n\nIf I go **UP** to (3, 4): enemy can\u2019t reach (3, 4) in one move \u2192 safe from head-on.  \nIf I go **DOWN** to (3, 2): enemy\u2019s possible moves: UP to (1, 2) \u2013 no conflict, DOWN to (1, 0) \u2013 no conflict, LEFT to (0, 1) \u2013 no conflict. So (3, 2) is safe from head-on.  \nIf I go **RIGHT** to (4, 3): enemy\u2019s moves: none reach (4, 3) in one move \u2192 safe from head-on.  \n\nSo all three possible moves are safe from immediate head-on collisions.  \n\nNext: **future mobility** from each candidate cell.  \n\n- UP to (3, 4): adjacent cells next turn: (3, 5), (4, 4), (2, 4), (3, 3). But (3, 3) will be my neck next turn, so not usable. So 3 possible exits if they\u2019re empty. Currently (3, 5), (4, 4), (2, 4) are empty.  \n- DOWN to (3, 2): adjacent cells next turn: (3, 3) neck, (4, 2), (2, 2), (3, 1). (3, 1) is enemy body segment \u2192 not safe unless enemy moves away. Actually (3, 1) is enemy body now, but enemy moves this turn. If enemy leaves (3, 1), it could become free, but risky to count on. Safer to assume (3, 1) may be occupied by enemy body still (since snake grows if eats apple). For now, (3, 1) is unsafe. So from (3, 2), possible safe moves next turn: (4, 2), (2, 2), maybe (3, 1) if vacated. That\u2019s 2 certain safe moves.  \n- RIGHT to (4, 3): adjacent cells next turn: (4, 4), (5, 3), (3, 3) neck, (4, 2). (4, 4), (5, 3), (4, 2) empty now \u2192 3 possible exits.  \n\nSo UP and RIGHT give better future mobility than DOWN.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple: (5, 5) is 4 moves away from (3, 3) in Manhattan distance.  \nFrom (3, 4): distance to (5, 5) = |5-3| + |5-4| = 3 moves.  \nFrom (4, 3): distance to (5, 5) = |5-4| + |5-3| = 3 moves also.  \nFrom (3, 2): distance to (5, 5) = |5-3| + |5-2| = 5 moves.  \n\nSo UP or RIGHT both bring me equally closer to (5, 5).  \n\n**Enemy\u2019s likely move:** Enemy at (1, 1) might go for apple at (0, 2) by moving LEFT to (0, 1) then UP to (0, 2) next turn, or UP to (1, 2) then LEFT to (0, 2). Either way, they\u2019ll likely move toward (0, 2). That moves them away from me.  \n\n**Potential trap avoidance:** Moving UP to (3, 4) is slightly closer to top apples later, but moving RIGHT to (4, 3) gets me toward center and maybe toward (5, 5) more directly.  \n\n**Choice:** Both UP and RIGHT are safe and keep options open. I\u2019ll choose **RIGHT** to continue moving toward (5, 5) while staying in safer central area.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (4, 3), check enemy\u2019s new head position, likely near (0, 2) or (1, 2). Avoid moving into (4, 2) if enemy could be at (4, 2) next turn (unlikely). Probably go UP to (4, 4) or RIGHT to (5, 3) next.  \n\nRIGHT",

(5, 2), (3, 2) empty.  \nAll 3 possible exits safe now \u2192 3 possible exits.  \n\n- **RIGHT (5, 3):**  \nAdjacent cells next turn: (5, 4), (6, 3), (4, 3) neck, (5, 2).  \n(5, 4), (6, 3), (5, 2) empty \u2192 3 possible exits.  \n\nAll give equal immediate mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple is (5, 5) at distance from (4, 3): |5-4| + |5-3| = 3 moves.  \n\nFrom (4, 4): distance to (5, 5) = |5-4| + |5-4| = 2 moves.  \nFrom (5, 3): distance to (5, 5) = |5-5| + |5-3| = 2 moves.  \nFrom (4, 2): distance to (5, 5) = |5-4| + |5-2| = 4 moves.  \n\nSo UP and RIGHT are equally closer to (5, 5), DOWN is farther.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy's likely move:**  \nEnemy will likely go LEFT to (0, 2) to eat apple there (growing to length 7). That moves enemy away from center.  \n\n---\n\n**Potential trap considerations:**  \nGoing UP toward top apples later might be good, but enemy is far left now.  \nGoing RIGHT to (5, 3) puts me closer to (5, 5) and also (5, 9) later.  \n\nBut note: if I go RIGHT now to (5, 3), next turn I could go UP to (5, 4) and then RIGHT to (6, 4) or UP to (5, 5) to get apple. That\u2019s a clear path.  \nIf I go UP now to (4, 4), next turn I could go UP to (4, 5) or RIGHT to (5, 4) toward apple.  \n\nBoth are fine.  \n\n---\n\n**Choice:**  \nI'll go **UP** to (4, 4) to keep central mobility and stay slightly away from right edge, while still being 2 moves from apple (5, 5).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 4), check enemy's new position (likely (0, 2) after eating apple). Avoid moving toward left side if enemy is long and could cut me off later. Aim for (5, 5) next via (4, 5) or (5, 4).  \n\nUP",

Goal Evaluation**\n\nI am stuck in the corner (0, 2) with a long body blocking my access to the right side of the board (where the apples are). I need to maneuver out.\n\nApples are at:\n1. (5, 5): D_manhattan = |5-0| + |5-2| = 5 + 3 = 8\n2. (6, 2): D_manhattan = |6-0| + |2-2| = 6 + 0 = 6 (Closest apple!)\n3. (3, 9): D_manhattan = |3-0| + |9-2| = 3 + 7 = 10\n4. (4, 9): D_manhattan = 11\n5. (5, 9): D_manhattan = 12\n\nThe closest apple is (6, 2). To reach (6, 2), I need to move along the y=2 row, but currently, my body occupies (1, 2). I must move either UP or DOWN to bypass my body and then move Right.\n\n**A. Move UP to (0, 3):**\nThis moves me away from my existing body bottleneck at (1, 2). It allows me to then move RIGHT to (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), etc., and eventually loop back down towards (6, 2) or (5, 5).\n\nPath to (6, 2) via UP: (0, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3). Then I hit (3, 3) which is currently Snake 0's tail (it will disappear this turn). If (3, 3) clears, I can proceed.\n\n**B. Move DOWN to (0, 1):**\nThis also moves me away from the (1, 2) bottleneck. I could then move RIGHT to (1, 1). However, (1, 1) is currently part of my body, so moving there would be fatal unless my tail shrinks *and* the segment (1, 1) is cleared before I reach it.\n\nMy body segments are: [(1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1)].\nIf I move down to (0, 1), the body shifts: Tail (3, 1) becomes empty.\nNext turn (T=20), I am at (0, 1). The segment (1, 1) would still exist. Moving RIGHT to (1, 1) would be fatal.\n\nTherefore, moving UP seems strategically much better as it avoids the dense cluster of my body segments along y=0 and y=1.\n\n**3. Next Step Plan (Focusing on UP)**\n\nIf I move UP to (0, 3):\nNew head: (0, 3). New body: [(0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1)].\n\nFrom (0, 3), I can try to move RIGHT to (1, 3) next turn (T=20) and begin circumventing my body.\n\n**4. Enemy Collision Check**\n\nEnemy Head 0 is at (4, 4).\nPossible moves for 0:\n*   UP (4, 5): 4 cells away from (0, 3).\n*   DOWN (4, 3): 4 cells away.\n*   LEFT (3, 4): 4 cells away.\n*   RIGHT (5, 4): 5 cells away.\n\nSnake 0 is far away and does not pose an immediate threat. It will likely try to move toward (5, 5) or the high apples (4, 9), (3, 9), (5, 9).\n\nIf 0 targets (5, 5), it will move UP to (4, 5) or RIGHT to (5, 4).\n\nIf Snake 0 moves to (3, 4), it is at D=4 from my target (0, 3). This remains safe.\n\n**5. Final Decision**\n\nMoving UP to (0, 3) is safe and sets me up for a maneuver out of the corner and towards the central apples (6, 2) and (5, 5). Moving DOWN limits my options too much due to my dense body below y=2.\n\n**Long Term Plan (T=20 onwards):**\nTarget (6, 2). From (0, 3), move RIGHT to (1, 3), then continue right, maneuvering around/through where the enemy snake #0's tail was/is.\n\nUP",

Wait, length 3: head moves to (3, 4), then segment 2 goes to (4, 4), segment 3 goes to (4, 3). So (3, 3) becomes empty after move. So (3, 3) is safe next turn? Actually next turn\u2019s neck is (4, 4), not (3, 3). So (3, 3) is free. Let\u2019s check: current body: head (4, 4), then (4, 3), then (3, 3). If I move LEFT to (3, 4), new body: head (3, 4), then (4, 4), then (4, 3). Tail (3, 3) is vacated. So (3, 3) is empty next turn. So all adjacent except neck (4, 4) are empty: (3, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3) empty \u2192 3 possible exits.\n\n- **RIGHT (5, 4):**  \nAdjacent next turn: (5, 5), (6, 4), (4, 4) neck, (5, 3).  \n(5, 3) empty, (6, 4) empty, (5, 5) apple \u2192 3 possible exits.\n\nAll three give 3 possible exits next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple: (5, 5) distance from (4, 4): |5-4| + |5-4| = 2 moves.  \n\nFrom (4, 5): distance to (5, 5) = |5-4| + |5-5| = 1 move.  \nFrom (5, 4): distance to (5, 5) = |5-5| + |5-4| = 1 move.  \nFrom (3, 4): distance to (5, 5) = |5-3| + |5-4| = 3 moves.\n\nSo UP or RIGHT are closer to (5, 5) than LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy\u2019s position:** enemy at (0, 2) far left, moving UP/DOWN away from me. Low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nWe want to grow to catch up in apples. (5, 5) is a key target. But going RIGHT to (5, 4) puts us adjacent to apple (5, 5), which could be eaten next turn. However, enemy is far away, so no rush. Also, apple at (6, 2) is closer to bottom, could be backup.  \n\nBut UP to (4, 5) also 1 move from (5, 5) via RIGHT next turn. Both UP and RIGHT equally good for apple proximity.  \n\nConsider board edges: UP to (4, 5) is more central, RIGHT to (5, 4) is near right edge but not trapped yet.\n\n---\n\n**Choice:**  \nI\u2019ll go **RIGHT** to (5, 4) to be adjacent to apple (5, 5), giving option to eat it next turn if safe. Also keeps open path upward toward top apples later.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5, 4), assess safety of moving to (5, 5) to eat apple. Check enemy\u2019s new head position (likely (0, 3) or (0, 1)). Avoid possible dead ends near right wall after growth.\n\nRIGHT",

(Empty cell).\n\n**Safe Moves: UP (0, 4) and RIGHT (1, 3).**\n\n**2. Goal Evaluation: Reaching Apples (Focus on (6, 2) or (5, 5))**\n\nWe successfully moved out of the tight corner. Now we need to head towards the apples, especially (6, 2) which is the closest (Manhattan distance D=6 from (0, 3) at T=19).\n\nCurrent head (0, 3).\n1. (6, 2): D = |6-0| + |2-3| = 6 + 1 = 7\n2. (5, 5): D = |5-0| + |5-3| = 5 + 2 = 7\n3. (3, 9): D = |3-0| + |9-3| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\nBoth (6, 2) and (5, 5) are 7 moves away. The goal is to move right along the boundary of my existing body to start traversing the board.\n\n**A. Move UP to (0, 4):**\nThis moves me further away from the main cluster of apples (6, 2) and (5, 5), but it allows me maximum vertical clearance along the far left wall before turning right.\n\nIf I go UP: (0, 4) -> (1, 4) -> (2, 4). This takes 3 moves to get to x=2, y=4.\n\n**B. Move RIGHT to (1, 3):**\nThis immediately starts moving me towards the center of the board, allowing me to maneuver around my body faster.\n\nIf I go RIGHT: (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (5, 3). This is a direct path towards the center, bypassing my body which is mostly below y=3.\n\nLet's check the path RIGHT:\nCurrent body segments are on y=0, 1, 2. The path (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3) is clear of my own snake.\n\n**3. Enemy Collision Avoidance / Prediction**\n\nEnemy 0 is at (5, 4). Tail is (4, 3), which will become empty this turn if they don't eat.\n\nPossible moves for Snake 0 (from (5, 4)):\n*   UP to (5, 5) (Apple! Highly likely).\n*   DOWN to (5, 3) (Safe, moves closer to center, blocks my path).\n*   LEFT to (4, 4) (Into their own body segment - FATAL). **KILLED.**\n*   RIGHT to (6, 4) (Safe, keeps central).\n\n**Prediction for Snake 0: UP to (5, 5) to eat the apple.**\n\nIf Snake 0 moves to (5, 5), my move RIGHT to (1, 3) remains perfectly safe.\n\n*   If I move RIGHT to (1, 3):\n    *   Next turn T=21, I can move RIGHT again to (2, 3), or UP/DOWN if needed.\n    *   This path seems optimal for breaking free and attempting to reach (6, 2) or the cleared area around (5, 5) if Snake 0 moves away.\n\n*   If Snake 0 moves DOWN to (5, 3): This blocks my ideal rightward push. If I get to (4, 3) at T=23, I might be blocked. However, I still have time to react.\n\nThe move RIGHT is the most aggressive and useful move for getting out of the corner towards the action. It keeps the maximum horizontal distance from my own body.\n\n**4. Considering (6, 2)**\n\nIf I aim for (6, 2), the path is generally down/right.\nCurrent Head (0, 3).\n1. Move RIGHT to (1, 3). T=20.\n2. Move RIGHT to (2, 3). T=21.\n3. Move RIGHT to (3, 3). T=22.\n4. Move DOWN to (3, 2). T=23.\n5. Move RIGHT to (4, 2). T=24.\n6. Move RIGHT to (5, 2). T=25.\n7. Move RIGHT to (6, 2) (Apple). T=26.\n\nThis path seems safe and direct, assuming no intervention from Snake 0 on the path (3, 2) to (5, 2). Snake 0 is still far away in the (5, 4) region. The move RIGHT is favorable.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** Continue moving right along the y=3 line until clear of my body mass, then turn down towards the closest apple at (6, 2).\n\nRIGHT",

(Empty cell).\n\n**Safe Moves: UP (1, 4) and RIGHT (2, 3).**\n\n**2. Goal Evaluation: Reaching Apples (Focus on (6, 2))**\n\nThe closest apple, now that (5, 5) is gone, is (6, 2).\n\nCurrent head (1, 3).\n1. (6, 2): D = |6-1| + |2-3| = 5 + 1 = 6\n2.

Move UP to (1, 4):** This moves one step further away from the current target (6, 2). It starts clearing the left side of the board for potential pathing later, but it doesn't immediately advance towards the critical area.\n\n**B. Move RIGHT to (2, 3):** This maintains the straight path out of the tight corner and directly advances towards (6, 2).\n\nThe previous plan was:\n1. Move RIGHT to (1, 3). (Done T=20)\n2. Move RIGHT to (2, 3). (Next move T=21)\n3. Move RIGHT to (3, 3). T=22.\n4. Move DOWN to (3, 2). T=23.\n5. Move RIGHT to (4, 2). T=24.\n6. Move RIGHT to (5, 2). T=25.\n7. Move RIGHT to (6, 2) (Apple). T=26.\n\nThis path remains entirely safe from my own body segments.\n\n**3. Enemy Collision Avoidance / Prediction**\n\nEnemy 0 is at (5, 5). They just ate an apple and are now length 4. Their tail (4, 3) will stay if they grow. Since they grew, (4, 3) is still occupied by the snake.\n\nPossible moves for Snake 0 (from (5, 5)):\n*   UP to (5, 6) (Safe).\n*   DOWN to (5, 4) (Into their own body segment (5, 4) - FATAL). **KILLED.** (Wait, the body segment (5, 4) is BEHIND the head, but moving directly backwards is only fatal if it hits the segment *immediately* behind. (5, 4) is immediately behind (5, 5). YES, DOWN is fatal.) **KILLED.**\n*   LEFT to (4, 5) (Safe).\n*   RIGHT to (6, 5) (Safe).\n\nSnake 0 is blocked from moving down and seems likely to move UP towards the dense apple cluster at y=9, or LEFT/RIGHT to explore.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 3), I am 3 squares horizontally and 2 squares vertically away from the enemy's zone (4, 3) and (5, 5). The enemy poses no immediate threat to my path (2, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 2).\n\nMy move RIGHT continues to execute the strategy of moving to the clear center region to access apples.\n\n**4. Considering (4, 7)**\nIf I decided to switch targets and go for (4, 7), the path might be:\n(1, 4) -> (1, 5) -> (2, 5) -> (3, 5) -> (4, 5) -> (4, 6) -> (4, 7). D=7 moves, but possibly crowded by Snake 0.\nIf Snake 0 moves LEFT to (4, 5), they block this path. If they move UP to (5, 6), they are still close to the path.\n\nSticking with the safer, clearer path towards (6, 2) by moving RIGHT to (2, 3) is the best immediate step.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (1-3 turns):**\nT=21: Move RIGHT to (2, 3).\nT=22: Move RIGHT to (3, 3).\nT=23: Move DOWN to (3, 2) (to bypass my body tail section if it stays).\n\nRIGHT",

(Empty cell).\n\n**Safe Moves: UP (2, 4), DOWN (2, 2), and RIGHT (3, 3).**\n\n**2. Goal Evaluation: Reaching Apples (Focus on (6, 2))**\n\nCurrent head (2, 3).\n1. (6, 2): D = |6-2| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5\n2. (4, 7): D = |4-2| + |7-3| = 2 + 4 = 6\n3. (3, 9): D = |3-2| + |9-3| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n(6, 2) is still the closest target. We need to move right and down.\n\n**A. Move UP to (2, 4):** Distance to (6, 2) becomes 4 + 2 = 6. Moves away from (6, 2), but slightly closer to (4, 7). This move is safe and keeps options open, potentially preparing for the upper apples if the enemy is distracted.\n**B. Move DOWN to (2, 2):** Distance to (6, 2) becomes 4 + 0 = 4. This is the optimal path for distance. It moves towards my tail segment (2, 1), but (2, 2) is safe.\n**C. Move RIGHT to (3, 3):** Distance to (6, 2) becomes 3 + 1 = 4. This is also an optimal path for distance. This continues the planned path.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT lead to Manhattan distance 4 from (6, 2).\n\n*   If I move DOWN to (2, 2), the next move could be RIGHT to (3, 2), which is adjacent to my current tail (2, 1). This is a good path.\n*   If I move RIGHT to (3, 3), the next move is DOWN to (3, 2). This is also excellent.\n\nThe path `(2, 3) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (6, 2)` (Apple) is 5 moves.\nThe path `(2, 3) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (6, 2)` (Apple) is also 5 moves.\n\nLet's evaluate the safety and long-term implications of (3, 3) vs (2, 2).\n\n**3. Enemy Prediction**\n\nEnemy 0 is at (5, 6). They are moving towards the high-value apple zone (y=9).\nPossible moves for Snake 0 (from (5, 6)):\n*   UP to (5, 7) (Safe, near apple (4, 7)).\n*   DOWN to (5, 5) (FATAL, into their body). **KILLED.**\n*   LEFT to (4, 6) (Safe).\n*   RIGHT to (6, 6) (Safe).\n\nSince (5, 5) is their body, they cannot move down. They will likely go UP to (5, 7) or LEFT to (4, 6) to scope out the (4, 7) apple. If they try to secure (4, 7), they might collide with my path if I move UP, but I am focused on (6, 2).\n\nMy goal (6, 2) is well out of the enemy's likely range for the next few turns.\n\n**4. Choosing between DOWN and RIGHT**\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (3, 3):** This retains space further away from the snake body cluster on the left side (x=0, 1, 2) and keeps the strategy simple: move right, then down. It feels slightly more open than moving closer to the low-y edge right now.\n*   **Move DOWN to (2, 2):** This moves closer to the tail (2, 1). If I grow, the tail stays. If I move to (2, 2), my body will occupy (1, 3). If I don't grow, the tail (2, 1) becomes empty, and (2, 2) is a good spot.\n\nSince I am not growing this turn, the segment (2, 1) will be evacuated.\nIf I choose DOWN to (2, 2):\nT=23 Body: (2, 2) Head, (2, 1) becomes vacant, (1, 1) becomes tail.\nT=23 Path: (3, 2) is safe.\n\nIf I choose RIGHT to (3, 3):\nT=23 Body: (3, 3) Head, (2, 1) becomes vacant, (1, 1) becomes tail.\nT=23 Path: (3, 2) is safe.\n\nBoth paths lead to (3, 2) being a viable target next turn, and ultimately allow access to (6, 2). Sticking to the planned path of moving RIGHT seems marginally better as it keeps the snake in a less congested area of the board currently, maximizing flexibility for future choices.\n\nPlanned sequence:\nT=22: RIGHT to (3, 3).\nT=23: DOWN to (3, 2).\nT=24: RIGHT to (4, 2).\nT=25: RIGHT to (5, 2).\nT=26: RIGHT to (6, 2) (Apple).\n\nThis path is clear and avoids the enemy's expected movements entirely.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (1-3 turns):**\nT=22: Move RIGHT to (3, 3).\nT=23: Move DOWN to (3, 2).\nT=24: Move RIGHT to (4, 2).\n\nRIGHT",

Immediate Safety Check (from (3, 3))**\n\n*   My previous head position / next body segment: (2, 3).\n*   My body segments: (2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 1).\n*   Enemy Head: (5, 7). Enemy Body: (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4).\n\n*   **UP to (3, 4):** Safe. (Empty cell).\n*   **DOWN to (3, 2):** Safe. (Empty cell).\n*   **LEFT to (2, 3):** KILLS ME (Moves into my immediate body segment). **KILLED.**\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 3):** Safe. (Empty cell).\n\n**Safe Moves: UP (3, 4), DOWN (3, 2), and RIGHT (4, 3).**\n\n**2. Goal Evaluation: Reaching Apples (Focus on (6, 2))**\n\nCurrent head (3, 3).\n\n1. (6, 2): D = |6-3| + |2-3| = 3 + 1 = 4. (Requires Down and Right movement)\n2. (4, 7): D = |4-3| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5.\n3. (3, 9): D = |3-3| + |9-3| = 0 + 6 = 6.\n\n(6, 2) is the closest target. We planned to move DOWN next.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (3, 2):** Distance to (6, 2) becomes 3 + 0 = 3. Excellent. This is the optimal path step towards (6, 2).\n*   **Move RIGHT to (4, 3):** Distance to (6, 2) becomes 2 + 1 = 3. Excellent. This is also an optimal path step. (Moves closer to enemy body though).\n*   **Move UP to (3, 4):** Distance to (6, 2) becomes 3 + 2 = 5. Moves away from (6, 2), but towards the upper apples. (4, 7) distance becomes 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nMoving DOWN or RIGHT are both optimal for reaching (6, 2).\n\n**3. Conflict and Path Safety**\n\nEnemy 0 is at (5, 7). They are currently hunting the high apples, likely (4, 7).\nPossible moves for Snake 0 (from (5, 7)):\n*   UP to (5, 8) (Safe, moves toward (5, 9) apple).\n*   DOWN to (5, 6) (FATAL, into their body). **KILLED.**\n*   LEFT to (4, 7) (Eats apple A4, 7. Safe). **Highly likely.**\n*   RIGHT to (6, 7) (Safe).\n\nIf Snake 0 moves LEFT to (4, 7) and eats the apple, my path is unaffected. If they move UP, my path is unaffected.\n\n**Comparing DOWN vs RIGHT:**\n\n**A. Move DOWN to (3, 2):**\nPath: (3, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (6, 2) (Apple).\nSafety: This move keeps me central on the board and away from the potential future paths of Snake 0, whose gravity is currently pulling them up and right towards the quadrant x>4, y>6. Moving down minimizes interaction risk.\n\n**B. Move RIGHT to (4, 3):**\nPath: (3, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (6, 3) -> (6, 2) (Apple). Or, (3, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (6, 2).\nSafety: (4, 3) is safe now. The next jump could be to (5, 3) or (4, 2). If I go to (5, 3), I am getting close to the enemy's vertical body segments (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6). This is riskier for long-term maneuverability, especially if the enemy decides to drop down the 5 column later.\n\nThe plan from T=22 was to move DOWN next: T=23: DOWN to (3, 2). This remains the safest and strategically simplest move.\n\n**4. Long-Term Strategy Check**\n\nT=23: Move DOWN to (3, 2).\nNew Head: (3, 2). Body: (3, 3), (2, 3), ... (1, 1). Tail vacated: (0, 1) (if T=22 body was 7 segments). (T=22 tail was (1, 1), which is now the last body segment listed. The segment (2, 1) was vacated after T=22).\n\nT=24: Move RIGHT to (4, 2). (Safe, still working towards 6, 2).\nT=25: Move RIGHT to (5, 2). (Safe, adjacent to enemy body (5, 4), but (5, 3) is free).\nT=26: Move RIGHT to (6, 2) (EAT Apple).\n\nThis path is clear. Sticking to DOWN.\n\nLong-Term Plan (1-3 turns):\nT=23: Move DOWN to (3, 2).\nT=24: Move RIGHT to (4, 2).\nT=25: Move RIGHT to (5, 2).\n\nDOWN",

Goal Evaluation: Reaching Apples (Focus on (6, 2))**\n\nCurrent head (3, 2).\n\n1. (6, 2): D = |6-3| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3. (A direct RIGHT path is optimal).\n2. (2, 0): D = |2-3| + |0-2| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n3. (4, 9): D = |4-3| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8.\n\n(6, 2) and (2, 0) are equally close (D=3). The plan from the previous turn was to prioritize (6, 2) since it involves moving along clear space (ROW 2).\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (4, 2):** Reduces distance to (6, 2) to 2. Optimal path continuation.\n*   **Move DOWN to (3, 1):** Reduces distance to (2, 0) to 1 + 1 = 2. Path towards (2, 0).\n*   **Move LEFT to (2, 2):** Reduces distance to (2, 0) to 0 + 2 = 2. Also reduces distance to (6, 2) to 4 + 0 = 4 (Moves away from 6, 2).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 2) advances the established goal of reaching (6, 2).\n\n**3. Enemy Interaction and Collision Avoidance**\n\nEnemy 0 is at (4, 7). They just ate the apple at (4, 7). They are currently long (Length 5) and operating in the top right quadrant.\n\nPossible moves for Snake 0 (from (4, 7)):\n*   UP to (4, 8) (Safe, towards top apples). **Likely.**\n*   DOWN to (4, 6) (Safe).\n*   LEFT to (3, 7) (Safe, towards center).\n*   RIGHT to (5, 7) (KILLS THEM, into their immediate body segments). **KILLED.**\n\nScenario A: Snake 0 moves UP to (4, 8). They continue hunting the high apples. This is perfectly safe for me moving RIGHT to (4, 2).\nScenario B: Snake 0 moves DOWN to (4, 6). They might be heading to my general area, but (4, 6) is still far from (4, 2).\nScenario C: Snake 0 moves LEFT to (3, 7). Also far away.\n\nThe path RIGHT to (4, 2) is perfectly safe from collision with Snake 0, whose gravity is acting toward Y=8/9.\n\n**4. Comparing Rationale for RIGHT vs DOWN/LEFT**\n\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 2):** This continues the multi-step plan to secure (6, 2). The path is clear: (4, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (6, 2). After eating (6, 2), I will be highly positioned to move towards (2, 0) or potentially UP if snake 0 has cleared the top area.\n*   **DOWN to (3, 1):** Moves toward (2, 0). Path (3, 1) -> (2, 1) or (3, 0) -> (2, 0). If I go (3, 1), the neighbor (2, 1) is adjacent to my body segment (1, 2) and (1, 3). This area is a little congested with my own snake body fragments.\n*   **LEFT to (2, 2):** Moves toward (2, 0). (2, 2) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 0). This path is also good, but (6, 2) is currently easier to access via a straight line RIGHT.\n\nI stick with the plan to secure (6, 2) first, as it is a less contested area and the path is straightforward.\n\n**5. Long-Term Strategy Check (T=25, T=26)**\nT=24: Move RIGHT to (4, 2).\nT=25: Move RIGHT to (5, 2). (Adjacent to the enemy body at (5, 4), but the cell is free).\nT=26: Move RIGHT to (6, 2) (EAT Apple).\n\nThis three-turn engagement plan remains sound and collision-free.\n\nLONG TERM PLAN:\nT=24: RIGHT to (4, 2).\nT=25: RIGHT to (5, 2).\nT=26: RIGHT to (6, 2) (Eat A).\n\nRIGHT",

D = 2.\n\n1. **RIGHT to (5, 2):** D(new) to (6, 2) is 1. This is the optimal continuation toward (6, 2).\n2. **UP to (4, 3):** D(new) to (6, 2) is |6-4| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3. Moves away from (6, 2).\n3. **DOWN to (4, 1):** D(new) to (6, 2) is |6-4| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3. Moves away from (6, 2).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 2) is the direct path to eat the apple (6, 2) next turn (T=26).\n\n**3. Enemy Interaction and Collision Avoidance**\n\nEnemy 0 is at (4, 8). Their previous move was UP. They are hunting apples (4, 9), (3, 9), (5, 9).\n\nSafe target cells for Snake 0 (from (4, 8)):\n*   UP to (4, 9) (EATS APPLE). **Most likely.**\n*   DOWN to (4, 7) (KILLS THEM, into their immediate body segments). **KILLED.**\n*   LEFT to (3, 8) (Safe).\n*   RIGHT to (5, 8) (Safe).\n\nIf Snake 0 moves to (4, 9), (3, 8), or (5, 8), they pose no threat to my move to (5, 2).\n\nCrucially, I must check future collisions:\n*   My move: (4, 2) -> (5, 2).\n*   The only close enemy snake segments are (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5).\n*   If Snake 0 moves, its tail at (5, 5) will vacate to (5, 4).\n*   My position (5, 2) is safe. The area is currently clear of enemy snakes.\n\nThe move RIGHT to (5, 2) is safe and optimal for the current goal.\n\n**4. Alternative Goal (2, 0)**\n\n(2, 0) is D = |2-4| + |0-2| = 2 + 2 = 4 away.\nIf I were aiming for (2, 0):\n*   UP: D=5. Bad.\n*   DOWN: D=|2-4| + |0-1| = 2 + 1 = 3. Better.\n*   RIGHT: D=5. Bad.\n\nSince (6, 2) is only D=2 away via the RIGHT path, and the apple is completely uncontested, I prioritize (6, 2).\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 2) is safe, leads directly to an apple, and is necessary to execute the planned T=26 apple acquisition.\n\nLONG TERM PLAN:\nT=25: Move RIGHT to (5, 2).\nT=26: Move RIGHT to (6, 2) (EAT Apple).\nT=27: Re-evaluate. Likely head southwest towards (2, 0) or look for a pathway UP, depending on Snake 0's position.\n\nRIGHT",

Since the board state shows 0 at (4, 9) and the body is still 5 segments long, they must have eaten an apple, keeping the tail at (5, 5) for now.\n\n*   Apples: (3, 9), (5, 9), (6, 2), (2, 0), (1, 4).\n\n**Board Snapshot (T=26):**\n 9 . . .

(Empty cell).\n*   **LEFT to (4, 2):** KILLS ME (Moves into my immediate body segment). **KILLED.**\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 2):** Safe, and EATS APPLE (6, 2). (This is the cell currently occupied by an apple).\n\nSafe Moves: UP (5, 3), DOWN (5, 1), RIGHT (6, 2).\n\n**2. Goal Evaluation: Reaching Apples**\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 2) secures an apple immediately, increasing my score to 7 and my lead over Snake 0 (currently 6 vs 5). This is the highest priority move.\n\n**3. Enemy Interaction and Collision Avoidance**\n\nSnake 0 is far away at (4, 9).\nPossible moves for Snake 0 (from (4, 9)):\n*   UP (4, 0) - Out of Bounds. **KILLED.**\n*   DOWN (4, 8) - KILLS THEM (into immediate body segment). **KILLED.**\n*   LEFT (3, 9) - EATS APPLE. **Highly Likely.**\n*   RIGHT (5, 9) - EATS APPLE. **Highly Likely.**\n\nSnake 0 is focused on the two adjacent apples (3, 9) and (5, 9). Regardless of their move, they will be around Y=9. No collision risk with my planned move to (6, 2).\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe move RIGHT to (6, 2) is safe, optimizes apple collection, and maintains my score lead.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T=27 onwards):**\nAfter eating the apple at (6, 2), my head will be at (6, 2). Snake 0 will be around Y=9. The next nearest apples are (2, 0) and (1, 4).\n*   (2, 0) is D = |2-6| + |0-2| = 4 + 2 = 6 away.\n*   (1, 4) is D = |1-6| + |4-2| = 5 + 2 = 7 away.\n\nThe apple (2, 0) in the southwest corner is the next primary target. I should plan to move primarily DOWN and then LEFT.\n\nT=26: Move RIGHT to (6, 2) (Eat Apple).\nT=27: Move DOWN to (6, 1) or (5, 2) depending on what opens up. (Start moving South/West).\n\nRIGHT",

(2, 0) seems structurally safer as it's less likely to involve crossing paths with snake 0, who is pinned high near Y=9. Targeting (2, 0) requires moving SOUTHWEST.\n\n**1.

Leads towards (9, 5).\n\nSafe Moves: UP (6, 3), DOWN (6, 1), RIGHT (7, 2).\n\n**2. Goal Evaluation and Strategy**\n\n*   **Target (2, 0):** This requires moving DOWN and then LEFT. DOWN to (6, 1) is a good starting move.\n*   **Target (9, 5):** This requires moving RIGHT and then UP. RIGHT to (7, 2) is a good starting move.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 2), I put myself on the right side of the board which often limits options.\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 1), I stay central and begin the approach to (2, 0).\n\nSnake 0 is heavily concentrated on the top row (Y=9), currently at (3, 9). They have one apple close by at (5, 9) and might move RIGHT towards it. If they move RIGHT to (5, 9), they eat an apple. If they move LEFT to (2, 9), they enter an empty area but are far from apples.\n\nSince Snake 0 is still long and constrained up north, focusing on the southern part of the board is strategically sound for growth and avoiding collisions.\n\nCurrent move: DOWN (6, 1) is the best choice to approach (2, 0).\n\n**3. Future Planning (T=28 onwards)**\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 1):\nNext turn (T=28), Head (6, 1). Target remains (2, 0).\nOptions:\n*   (6, 0) - DOWN towards goal.\n*   (5, 1) - LEFT towards goal.\n\nBoth (6, 0) and (5, 1) are likely safe.\n\n**4. Move Selection**\n\nDOWN is safe and optimally moves me toward the (2, 0) apple while maintaining central board presence and avoiding Snake 0's active zone.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T=28 onwards):**\nContinue moving toward the apple at (2, 0). My general trajectory should be DOWN/LEFT (6, 1) -> (5, 1) or (6, 0) -> (5, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (2, 0). At T=28, I will consider if moving LEFT to (5, 1) or DOWN to (6, 0) is better for pathing efficiency.\n\nDOWN",

Target (2, 0). I need to move DOWN and LEFT.\n\n**1. Immediate Safety Check (from (6, 1))**\n\n*   **UP to (6, 2):** KILLS ME (Moves into my immediate body segment). **KILLED.**\n*   **DOWN to (6, 0):** Safe. (Empty cell). Leads towards (2, 0).\n*   **LEFT to (5, 1):** Safe. (Empty cell). Leads towards (2, 0).\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 1):** Safe. (Empty cell).\n\nSafe Moves: DOWN (6, 0), LEFT (5, 1), RIGHT (7, 1).\n\n**2. Enemy Prediction (Snake 0 at (3, 8))**\n\nSnake 0 is near three apples: (5, 9), (1, 7), and (1, 4) (though 1, 4 is much farther).\nThe most urgent apple for Snake 0 is (5, 9).\nTo reach (5, 9), Snake 0 will likely move:\nA) RIGHT to (4, 8) - Into Body. KILLED.\nB) UP to (3, 9) - Into Body. KILLED.\nC) DOWN to (3, 7) - Safe.\nD) LEFT to (2, 8) - Safe.\n\nGiven that moving to (3, 9) or (4, 8) would kill Snake 0, it must move DOWN or LEFT.\n\n*   If Snake 0 moves DOWN to (3, 7): It moves away from (5, 9) but closer to (1, 7) (D=5).\n*   If Snake 0 moves LEFT to (2, 8): It stays equidistant from (5, 9) (D=7) and moves close to (1, 7) (D=8).\n\nSnake 0 is long and currently constrained by its own body segments at (3, 9) and (4, 8). This means Snake 0 is not a threat to me in the south.\n\n**3. Optimal Pathing to (2, 0)**\n\nFrom (6, 1):\nA) Move DOWN to (6, 0): Next safe options are (5, 0) [LEFT] or (7, 0) [RIGHT]. (5, 0) leads to the goal quickly.\nB) Move LEFT to (5, 1): Next safe options are (5, 0) [DOWN] or (4, 1) [LEFT]. (5, 0) or (4, 1) lead to the goal quickly.\n\n*   Path A (DOWN): (6, 1) -> (6, 0) -> (5, 0) -> (4, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (2, 0). Total 5 moves.\n*   Path B (LEFT): (6, 1) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 0) (or 4, 1) -> ... Total 5 moves.\n\nBoth are 5 steps.\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 1), I am already 1 step closer horizontally. If I move DOWN to (6, 0), I am 1 step closer vertically. The apple is (2, 0).\nCurrent differential: 4 steps \u0394X, 1 step \u0394Y. I should prioritize closing the largest gap, which is X.\n\n**Move LEFT to (5, 1):**\nThis reduces the X distance to 3, and Y distance remains 1. (3, 1) is the new displacement.\nNext turn (T=29), I would be at (5, 1). Ideal moves would be LEFT (4, 1) or DOWN (5, 0). Both are safe. This seems the most efficient path toward (2, 0).\n\n**Move DOWN to (6, 0):**\nThis reduces the Y distance to 0, and X distance remains 4. (4, 0) is the new displacement.\nNext turn (T=29), I would be at (6, 0). Ideal move would be LEFT (5, 0). Safe.\n\nBoth moves keep me safe and lead directly to the goal. LEFT (5, 1) is slightly better for immediate maneuvering efficiency towards (2, 0) as it closes the larger coordinate gap first.\n\n**4. Move Selection**\nChoosing LEFT to (5, 1).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T=29 onwards):**\nContinue pathing towards (2, 0). From (5, 1), move LEFT to (4, 1) or DOWN to (5, 0) to maintain momentum towards the target. (5, 0) seems slightly preferable as it gets me on the row of the apple.\n\nLEFT",

All cells (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0) are currently empty floor space.\n\nOption B (LEFT): (5, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 0). (4 steps total, landing on 2, 0 at T=33). All cells (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1) are currently empty floor space.\n\nBoth paths are equally efficient in terms of steps.\nHowever, if I move DOWN to (5, 0), I get to the Y=0 row immediately, which is the row of the apple. This might give me slightly better maneuvering options if an unexpected constraint appears on row Y=1. Moving along a boundary (Y=0) is often a good default strategy when moving towards a target on that boundary.\n\nLet's check constraints for the subsequent move (T=30):\nIf I choose DOWN (5, 0): At T=30, my body at (5, 1) and (6, 1) and (6, 2) creates a \"T\" shape barrier.\nFrom (5, 0), I can move LEFT (4, 0) or RIGHT (6, 0). (4, 0) moves towards the goal. Safe.\n\nIf I choose LEFT (4, 1): At T=30, my body at (5, 1) and (6, 1) and (6, 2) is still there. My new head is (4, 1).\nFrom (4, 1), I can move LEFT (3, 1) or DOWN (4, 0). (3, 1) moves towards the goal X=2. (4, 0) allows movement toward Y=0. Both are viable.\n\nI will prioritize DOWN to lock in the Y coordinate acquisition towards the goal (2, 0).\n\n**4. Move Selection**\nChoosing DOWN to (5, 0).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T=30 onwards):**\nContinue pathing towards (2, 0). From (5, 0), move LEFT (4, 0), then LEFT (3, 0), then LEFT (2, 0) to eat the apple.\n\nDOWN",

Enemy possible moves from (5, 1):**  \nNeck at (6, 1), so enemy can't go RIGHT into (6,1).  \nPossible enemy moves:  \n- UP (5, 2) \u2192 its own body \u2192 fatal.  \n- DOWN (5, 0) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (4, 1) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (6, 1) \u2192 its own body \u2192 fatal.  \nEnemy safe: DOWN, LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**3. Collision risk this turn:**  \nMy UP to (2, 9): enemy cannot reach (2, 9) in one move \u2192 safe.  \nMy DOWN to (2, 7): enemy cannot reach (2, 7) \u2192 safe.  \nMy LEFT to (1, 8): enemy cannot reach (1, 8) \u2192 safe.  \nNo immediate head-on collision possible.\n\n---\n\n**4. Apple proximity:**  \nFrom (2, 8):  \n- (1, 7): distance = |2-1| + |8-7| = 2  \n- (5, 9): distance = |2-5| + |8-9| = 4  \n- (1, 4): distance = 5  \n- (2, 0): distance = 8  \n- (9, 5): distance = 10  \n\nClosest apple is (1, 7).  \nLEFT \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 distance to (1, 7) = 1.  \nDOWN \u2192 (2, 7) \u2192 distance to (1, 7) = 1.  \nUP \u2192 (2, 9) \u2192 distance to (1, 7) = 3.\n\nSo DOWN or LEFT equally close to nearest apple.\n\n---\n\n**5. Future mobility after each safe move:**\n\n**UP to (2, 9):**  \nFrom (2, 9):  \n- UP \u2192 off board \u2192 fatal.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 8) \u2192 my body \u2192 fatal.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 9) \u2192 my body \u2192 fatal.  \nSafe next moves: LEFT only \u2192 1 option \u2192 risky.\n\n**DOWN to (2, 7):**  \nFrom (2, 7):  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 8) \u2192 my body \u2192 fatal.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 6) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 7) \u2192 apple (eat apple \u2192 grow \u2192 new tail at old tail position next turn).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 7) \u2192 empty? Check body: (4, 7) is my tail but not adjacent to (3, 7) \u2192 safe.  \nSafe next moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2192 3 options.\n\n**LEFT to (1, 8):**  \nFrom (1, 8):  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 7) \u2192 apple (eat next turn).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 8) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 8) \u2192 my body \u2192 fatal.  \nSafe next moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT \u2192 3 options.\n\nDOWN and LEFT both give 3 safe options next turn; UP gives only 1. So eliminate UP.\n\n---\n\n**6. Choosing between DOWN and LEFT:**  \nBoth good. LEFT (1, 8) is closer to apple (1, 7) for next turn (distance 1). DOWN (2, 7) also distance 1 to (1, 7).  \nBut DOWN might be slightly better because:  \n- From (2, 7), I can go LEFT to apple (1, 7) next turn, or DOWN/Right to keep options open.  \n- From (1, 8), going DOWN to (1, 7) eats apple next turn, but then my body will be at (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), etc. Might reduce mobility after eating.  \n\nActually, eating apple is good either way. Let's check enemy position: enemy at (5, 1), far away, not an immediate threat.  \n\nI'll pick DOWN because from (2, 7) I have three open directions next turn, including immediate apple access, and it's slightly more central than going to (1, 8) near left edge.\n\n---\n\n**Next turn plan note:**  \nFrom (2, 7), strongly consider LEFT to (1, 7) to eat apple next turn unless enemy suddenly moves close. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s path toward apples (1, 4) or (2, 0).  \n\nDOWN",

(Away from (1, 7)).\n*   LEFT to (1, 7): Safe. EATS APPLE (1, 7).\n*   RIGHT to (3, 7): Safe.\n\nLikely move for Snake 0 is LEFT to (1, 7) to eat the apple.\n\nIf Snake 0 moves LEFT to (1, 7), its proximity to me remains zero, as we are on opposite sides of the board. No collision risk or immediate threat.\n\n**3. Optimal Pathing to (2, 0)**\n\nI am at (5, 0). Target: (2, 0). I need to move LEFT.\n\nMove LEFT to (4, 0).

Move Selection**\nThe required move is LEFT.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T=31 onwards):**\nContinue moving LEFT towards (2, 0). The next two moves should be LEFT and then LEFT to secure the apple at T=32.\n\nLEFT",

Optimal Pathing to (2, 0)**\n\nI am at (4, 0). Target: (2, 0).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 0):\nT=31: (4, 0) -> LEFT to (3, 0)\nT=32: (3, 0) -> LEFT to (2, 0) (EAT)\n\nThis path remains safe, efficient, and ensures I secure the apple at T=32.\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 1):\nI move away from the apple, which is unnecessary given the clear path. I would then have to negotiate my body segments (5, 1) and (6, 1) to get back down, or move up further to cross the body line at Y=2. This is suboptimal.\n\n**3. Enemy Prediction (Snake 0 at (1, 7))**\n\nS0 is at (1, 7). It just ate, so it is likely looking for the next closest apple.\nApples: (5, 9), (2, 0) (Eaten by me T=32), (1, 4), (9, 5).\n\nDistances from S0 (1, 7):\n*   (5, 9): Manhattan distance 4 + 2 = 6.\n*   (1, 4): Manhattan distance 0 + 3 = 3.\n*   (9, 5): Manhattan distance 8 + 2 = 10.\n\nSnake 0 is heavily favored to move toward (1, 4).\nFrom (1, 7):\n*   UP (1, 8): Safe.\n*   DOWN (1, 6): Safe. Towards (1, 4).\n*   LEFT (0, 7): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (2, 7): Into body. KILLED.\n\nLikely path for S0 toward (1, 4): DOWN, DOWN, DOWN.\nT=31: (1, 7) -> DOWN to (1, 6)\nT=32: (1, 6) -> DOWN to (1, 5)\nT=33: (1, 5) -> DOWN to (1, 4) (EAT)\n\nS0 poses no threat to my current position or objective.\n\n**4. Move Selection**\nThe optimal move is LEFT to (3, 0) to stay on target for the (2, 0) apple.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T=32 onwards):**\nT=32: Move LEFT again to (2, 0) to eat the apple. After eating (2, 0), the snake will be 9 segments long.\nNew closest apples will be (1, 4) (D=2, if S0 doesn't get it first) and (9, 5). Since S0 is likely heading for (1, 4), I should look towards (9, 5) or possibly try to contest (1, 4) if S0's path is slow or restricted. (1, 4) is only 2 moves away from (2, 0) if I go UP, then LEFT. But S0 is already at (1, 7) and will be at (1, 6) this turn, making it extremely likely S0 reaches (1, 4) first (T=33).\n\nI will prioritize the (5, 9) apple (D=8 from (2, 0)) or maybe look for (9, 5) (D=7 from (2, 0)). Given the current position is bottom left, (9, 5) is perhaps better for opening up the board and avoiding my own body segments which are mostly in the lower-middle and lower-right area.\n\nFor now, the move is LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

(But S0 is likely taking this.)\n*   (1, 2): D = 1 + 2 = 3.\n*   (9, 5): D = 7 + 5 = 12.\n*   (5, 9): D = 3 + 9 = 12.\n\nS0 is expected to be at (1, 5). S0's length is 8.\nDistances from S0 (1, 5):\n*   (1, 4): D = 1. (Very likely S0 will take this next turn, T=33).\n*   (1, 2): D = 3.\n\nSince S0 is strongly favored to take (1, 4) next turn (T=33), I should focus on (1, 2) or re-evaluate after S0 movement.\n\n(1, 2) is D=3 away from (2, 0).\nPath options from (2, 0):\n1. UP to (2, 1) or (2, 2) then LEFT to (1, 2).\n2. RIGHT to (3, 0) is into my body (if I didn't eat), but since I eat, (3, 0) becomes body segment #2.\n\nPath toward (1, 2):\nT=33: From (2, 0), move UP to (2, 1). Safe.\nT=34: From (2, 1), move UP to (2, 2). Safe. (2, 2) is currently an Apple/A, so I can potentially eat here. Ah, (2, 2) is *A* in the board visualization. Let me reassess the apple list.\n\nApples list: (5, 9), (2, 0), (1, 4), (9, 5), (1, 2).\nThe list provided states (1, 2) is an apple.\nThe board visualization shows 'A' at (1, 4), (9, 5), (5, 9), (1, 2), and (2, 0). This confirms my observations.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 0) (EAT) this turn:\nNext turn (T=33), from (2, 0), I can move UP to (2, 1).\nThen (T=34), from (2, 1), I can move UP to (2, 2). (2, 2) is not an apple.\nThen (T=35), from (2, 2), I can move LEFT to (1, 2) (EAT).\n\nPath to (1, 2): (2, 0) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2). Total 3 moves to eat. A good plan.\nS0 is expected to reach (1, 4) at T=33.\n\nThe immediate move is clear: LEFT to eat (2, 0).\n\nLEFT",

Eliminate.  \n2. **DOWN**: (1, 5) \u2014 not occupied by any snake body currently.  \n3. **LEFT**: (0, 6) \u2014 not occupied.  \n4. **RIGHT**: (2, 6) \u2014 not occupied.  \n\n**Enemy snake #1:** head at (3, 0), body: [(4, 0), (5, 0), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2)]  \n\nCheck where enemy head could move: from (3, 0):  \n- UP: (3, 1) \u2014 empty.  \n- DOWN: (3, -1) \u2014 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT: (2, 0) \u2014 currently an apple at (2, 0), but enemy body? No, empty. Possible move.  \n- RIGHT: (4, 0) \u2014 occupied by its own body (second segment) \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo enemy possible moves: UP to (3, 1), LEFT to (2, 0).  \n\n**Now, could enemy head collide with my possible moves this turn?**  \nMy possible safe moves: DOWN (1, 5), LEFT (0, 6), RIGHT (2, 6).  \nEnemy head possible destinations: (3, 1) and (2, 0). None match (1, 5), (0, 6), or (2, 6). So no head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Check for enemy body in my target squares:**  \nEnemy body coordinates: (4,0),(5,0),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(5,2),(4,2) \u2014 none near my target squares.  \n\nSo all three moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe from immediate death.  \n\n**Now, which is best for apples and future options?**  \n\nApples: (5,9), (2,0), (1,4), (9,5), (1,2).  \n\nFrom my head (1,6):  \n- DOWN to (1,5): distance to (1,4) = 1 step away next turn (Manhattan distance). Also closer to (1,2) maybe later.  \n- LEFT to (0,6): far from most apples except maybe (9,5) but that\u2019s far.  \n- RIGHT to (2,6): slightly closer to (2,0)? Actually (2,0) is far in y; (1,4) is closer from (2,6) than from (0,6).  \n\nBut (1,4) is directly below (1,5). If I go DOWN to (1,5), next turn I can go DOWN again to (1,4) to eat apple, unless enemy gets there? Enemy head at (3,0) far away.  \n\nCheck if (1,4) is safe next turn if I go to (1,5) now:  \nFrom (1,5), possible moves next turn: UP back to (1,6) (occupied by my old head position? No, body will move forward if no apple eaten \u2014 wait, I haven\u2019t eaten apple this turn, so my tail at (4,8) will move to (?,?) depending on movement. Let\u2019s simulate:  \n\nMy body currently: head (1,6), then (1,7),(2,7),(2,8),(3,8),(3,9),(4,9),(4,8) tail.  \nIf I move DOWN to (1,5), new head (1,5), then body becomes: (1,6),(1,7),(2,7),(2,8),(3,8),(3,9),(4,9), tail segment (4,8) disappears (since no apple eaten). So new body: (1,5),(1,6),(1,7),(2,7),(2,8),(3,8),(3,9),(4,9). Tail gone from (4,8), but (4,9) is now last segment.  \n\nSo (1,4) next turn: from (1,5) go DOWN to (1,4). Is (1,4) safe then? Not occupied by my body then (check: my body next turn if I go DOWN now: (1,5),(1,6),(1,7),(2,7),(2,8),(3,8),(3,9),(4,9) \u2014 so (1,4) empty). Also no enemy body there currently, enemy head far. So likely safe.  \n\nLEFT (0,6) or RIGHT (2,6) don\u2019t get me as directly toward nearest apple (1,4).  \n\n**Future openness:**  \nFrom (1,5): possible moves next turn: UP to (1,6) (occupied by my body next turn? Yes \u2014 second segment), so not safe. DOWN to (1,4) safe. LEFT to (0,5) safe? RIGHT to (2,5) safe? Need to check board then: from (1,5), LEFT (0,5) empty now, RIGHT (2,5) empty now. So at least 2 safe moves next turn from (1,5).  \n\nFrom (0,6): next turn moves: UP (0,7) empty, DOWN (0,5) empty, RIGHT (1,6) occupied by my body. So 2 safe moves.  \n\nFrom (2,6): next turn moves: UP (2,7) occupied by my body, DOWN (2,5) empty, LEFT (1,6) occupied, RIGHT (3,6) empty. So 2 safe moves.  \n\nAll give 2 safe moves next turn. But DOWN gets me closer to apple (1,4), which I can eat next turn safely. That grows me, improves score, opens more space later.  \n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nEat (1,4) next turn if safe, then consider path to (1,2) or (2,0) while avoiding trapping myself. Keep distance from enemy head \u2014 currently far away but could come up.  \n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN",

Enemy Prediction (Snake 0 at (1, 5))**\n\nS0 is highly likely to move DOWN to (1, 4) to eat the apple.\n\nFrom (1, 5):\n*   UP (1, 6): KILLS S0 (Into body segment).\n*   DOWN (1, 4): Safe. EATS APPLE.\n*   LEFT (0, 5): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (2, 5): Safe.\n\nExpected S0 move: DOWN to (1, 4). This move is safe for S0 as (1, 4) is an apple.\n\n**4. Collision Check**\nMy safe moves are (2, 1) and (1, 0).\nS0 target move is (1, 4). No collision risk.\n\n**5. Choosing between (2, 1) and (1, 0)**\n\nThe goal is (1, 2).\n\n*   **Move UP to (2, 1):**\n    *   T=33: (2, 0) -> (2, 1)\n    *   T=34: From (2, 1), move UP to (2, 2). (Safe).\n    *   T=35: From (2, 2), move LEFT to (1, 2). (EAT).\n    *   This is the quickest safe path to (1, 2) in 3 moves.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (1, 0):**\n    *   T=33: (2, 0) -> (1, 0)\n    *   T=34: From (1, 0), move UP to (1, 1). (Safe).\n    *   T=35: From (1, 1), move UP to (1, 2). (EAT).\n    *   This also takes 3 moves.\n\nBoth paths are equally efficient in terms of distance. Let's look at long-term safety and flow.\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 1), I stay away from the walls initially and move away from S0's expected movement area (around x=1). S0 is likely moving up the x=1 column, consuming (1, 4). If S0 moves DOWN to (1, 4), S0's body extends towards (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 0), I am closer to S0's new body segment list, but S0 is heading north.\n\nLet's evaluate the board after S0 eats (1, 4). S0's head will be at (1, 4). S0's length will be 9. The new segment is (1, 5). S0 body: [(1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), ...]. My head (2, 0). My body is mostly to the right of me.\n\nIf I choose UP to (2, 1):\nT=34 position: (2, 1). Safe.\nT=34 S0 position: (1, 4). Safe.\nAt T=34, my next move to (2, 2) is safe.\n\nIf I choose LEFT to (1, 0):\nT=34 position: (1, 0). Safe.\nT=34 S0 position: (1, 4). Safe.\nAt T=34, my next move to (1, 1). This is adjacent to the path S0 took to (1, 4). If S0 decided to move to my location instead of the apple (unlikely, but possible), or if S0 changes direction (e.g., moves RIGHT to (2, 4)), then moving along the x=1 column might be riskier.\n\nHowever, moving UP along x=2 to (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) seems slightly strategically better as it uses the interior space before cutting across to the target apple (1, 2).\n\nLet's stick with the UP direction to pursue (1, 2).\n\nUP\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n1. T=33: Move UP to (2, 1) (Current move). S0 is expected to eat (1, 4).\n2. T=34: Move UP to (2, 2).\n3. T=35: Move LEFT to (1, 2) (EAT).\n4. After T=35, look for (5, 9) or (9, 5) or (8, 9). S0 will likely turn around or go after the highest remaining remote apple. I will be at (1, 2), S0 at (1, 4) (or nearby). If S0 moves north towards (5, 9) or (8, 9), I can follow S0 or go for a remote apple myself, or potentially cut S0 off.\n\nUP",

All three moves are immediately safe.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n- **DOWN** gets the apple at (1,4), increasing my score to 8 (tying enemy) and growing my length to 9. Next turn from (1,4), I\u2019ll have three safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). This also positions me to pursue the apple at (1,2).\n- **LEFT** to (0,5) yields no apple and leaves me on the edge with only two safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN), reducing mobility.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,5) yields no apple but offers three safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT), though it delays apple collection.\n\nGiven the immediate benefit and future options, **DOWN** is optimal.\n\n**Long-term plan:** After eating (1,4), consider moving down toward (1,2) if safe, but monitor enemy movements\u2014it may also head that way. If a collision risk emerges, divert left or right to avoid it and target other apples (e.g., (9,5) or (5,9)). Maintain flexibility and avoid trapping myself along the left wall.\n\nDOWN",

S0 just ate and is likely looking for the next apple.\nNearby apples for S0:\n*   (1, 2): 2 moves away (S0 priority target if I don't get there).\n*   (7, 3): 6 moves away.\n\nIf S0 considers (1, 2), S0 moves:\nPath 1: (1, 4) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 2).\nPath 2: (1, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2).

Safe moves for S0:\n1.  DOWN to (1, 3). (Targeting (1, 2)).\n2.  LEFT to (0, 4).\n3.  RIGHT to (2, 4).\n4.  UP to (1, 5): KILLS S0 (Into body segment (1, 5)).\n\nS0 is extremely likely to go for (1, 2) given its position (score tied, high competitive pressure). (1, 3) is the optimal path for S0.\n\nIf both S0 (from (1, 3)) and I (from (2, 2) or (1, 1)) target (1, 2) on T=35, we commit to a HOC. I cannot risk a 50/50 collision. I must prevent S0 from reaching (1, 3) or at least delay my approach to (1, 2) until T=35, calculating S0's T=35 position.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Block or Delay**\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 2) on T=34:\nS0 moves to (1, 3).\nT=35: S0 is at (1, 3). My next move must avoid collision.\nFrom (2, 2), I can move:\n*   LEFT to (1, 2): **COLLISION RISK.** S0 (1, 3) can move UP to (1, 2).\n*   UP to (2, 3): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (3, 2): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (2, 1): Safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 1) on T=34:\nS0 moves to (1, 3).\nT=35: S0 is at (1, 3).\nFrom (1, 1), I can move:\n*   UP to (1, 2): **COLLISION RISK.**\n*   LEFT to (0, 1): Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (2, 1): Safe.\n*   DOWN to (1, 0): Safe.\n\nTo secure the apple (1, 2), I need to move to (1, 2) before S0's head reaches (1, 2). Since S0 is 2 moves away via (1, 3), and I am 2 moves away via (1, 1) or (2, 2), if we both choose the optimal path, we die.\n\nI must use T=34 to reach a blocking position or an adjacent safe position that guarantees the next turn spot.\n\nLet's look at S0's T=34 move: If S0 moves to (1, 3), I have to assume S0 is going for (1, 2).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 1):\nT=34: I am at (3, 1).\nT=34: S0 is at (1, 3).\nT=35: I move back LEFT/UP towards (1, 2)? No, this path is too long now. (3, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (1, 1) -> (1, 2) (4 moves total). S0 gets the apple.\n\nIf I concede (1, 2) and go for (7, 3).\nFrom (2, 1): (2, 1) -> (3, 1) -> (4, 1) -> (5, 1) (body) -> ...\n\nThis apple (1, 2) is critical because it's the closest, and S0 is tied with me.\n\nLet's find a move that potentially blocks S0 or forces S0 into a less optimal path, while still progressing toward the apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 2).\nS0 moves to (1, 3).\nNow, at T=35, S0 is at (1, 3). S0 has a body segment at (1, 4).\nFrom my position (2, 2):\n1.  Move LEFT to (1, 2) (EAT).\n2.  S0 at (1, 3) can move UP to (1, 2). Collision.\n\nWhat if S0 realizes the collision risk? S0 might avoid (1, 2) if it sees me move to (2, 2) or (1, 1). If S0 moves to (2, 4) or (0, 4), I get the apple safely. I cannot rely on S0 being cautious.\n\n**Blocking Move Consideration:**\n\nCan I block S0 at (1, 3)?\nMy current head is (2, 1). (1, 3) is 1 LEFT, 2 UP. D=3. S0 is D=1 away (DOWN). I cannot block S0's optimal route.\n\nSince a collision is highly probable if I go for the 2-move capture, I must take a 3-move capture route and hope S0 moves to a different apple, or try to cut S0 off.\n\nIf S0 continues north towards the cluster of apples (5, 9, 8, 9).\nS0 at (1, 4).\nS0 goes (1, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> ... (away from 1, 2).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 1).\nT=34: I at (1, 1). S0 at (1, 3).\nT=35: I can move UP to (1, 2) (Collision Risk)\nOR I can move LEFT to (0, 1).\nT=35: S0 is at (1, 3). S0 will move UP to (1, 2). S0 gets the apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 2).\nT=34: I at (2, 2). S0 at (1, 3).\nT=35: If I hold (2, 2) and delay the capture, S0 still gets it.\n\n**Conclusion: We are in a race where the optimal path leads to death.**\n\nBecause I am at (2, 1) and S0 is at (1, 4), and the apple is at (1, 2), S0 has slightly better position to threaten the apple path (straight line movement for S0 (1, 4) -> (1, 3)). I have to move LEFT or UP to reach the necessary column.\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 2).\nT=35: I should not move to (1, 2). I should move UP to (2, 3).\nT=36: I can move to (1, 3). (This means S0 must have eaten (1, 2) on T=35 and moved away, or S0 dies).\n\nWhat if S0 moves to (2, 4)?\nS0 (1, 4) -> (2, 4).\nI move UP to (2, 2).\nT=35: I move LEFT to (1, 2) (EAT). Safe. S0 is far away.\n\nGiven the tie in score, S0 is likely to choose the apple (1, 2). If I back off, S0 scores. If I rush, we might collide.\n\nLet's assume S0 plays rationally and identifies the collision risk but assumes I will back off. That means S0 goes for (1, 3). If S0 is aggressive, S0 goes for (1, 3).\n\nI cannot afford to die here. I must choose a path that is safe from collision, even if it means conceding the apple (1, 2).\n\nLet's calculate the cost of getting (1, 2):\nIf I play LEFT to (1, 1) on T=34, and S0 plays DOWN to (1, 3) on T=34.\nT=35: S0 will move UP to (1, 2) and EAT. I will move to a safe spot (e.g., (0, 1) or (2, 1)). S0 scores.\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 2).\nT=34: I at (2, 2). S0 at (1, 3).\nT=35: I move UP to (2, 3). S0 moves UP to (1, 2) and EAT. Safe for me, S0 scores.\n\nIf I let S0 score (1, 2), the score becomes 9-8. I need to pivot to secure another apple. (7, 3) is relatively close.\n\nLet's look at the remaining apples: (5, 9), (9, 5), (8, 9), (7, 3).\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 2), I am well positioned to head towards (7, 3) or north to (5, 9).\nDistance to (7, 3) from (2, 2): 5 + 1 = 6.\nDistance to (7, 3) from (3, 1): 4 + 2 = 6.\n\nIf I choose UP (2, 2), I maintain freedom of movement and position myself to go for other apples, accepting that S0 will probably take (1, 2).\n\nMove: UP (to 2, 2).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n1. T=34: Move UP to (2, 2). (Concede (1, 2) to S0 to ensure survival/safety, or hope S0 moves elsewhere). S0 is expected to move to (1, 3).\n2. T=35: S0 eats (1, 2). I move RIGHT to (3, 2), or UP to (2, 3), shifting direction towards (7, 3). (7, 3) is a priority, or (9, 5) if S0 goes north.\n3. T=36+: Secure (7, 3).\n\nUP",

S0 actually moved RIGHT to (2, 4). This means S0 is either going for (7, 3) or the northern apples (5, 9), (8, 9), or S0 was prioritizing blocking/safety.\n\n**1. Immediate Safety Check (from (2, 2))**\n\n*   **UP to (2, 3):** Safe. (Empty floor).\n*   **DOWN to (2, 1):** Into my body segment, (2, 1). KILLS ME.\n*   **LEFT to (1, 2):** Apple! (1, 2). Safe. EATS APPLE.\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 2):** Safe. (Empty floor).\n\nSafe Moves: UP (2, 3), LEFT (1, 2) [EAT], RIGHT (3, 2).\n\n**2. Optimal Move Selection & Conflict Check**\n\nThe apple (1, 2) is now 1 move away and appears safe from Enemy Snake #0. S0 is currently at (2, 4) and would require at least 3 moves to reach (1, 2) if it turns around (e.g., (2, 4) -> (1, 4) [Body] -> (1, 3) -> (1, 2)). Wait, S0's body is at (1, 4). So S0 cannot move LEFT to (1, 4).\n\nS0 at (2, 4) must move:\n1. UP to (2, 5) (Safe, 2 moves to body (1, 5)).\n2. RIGHT to (3, 4) (Safe).\n3. DOWN to (2, 3) (Safe, but conflicts with my UP option).\n\nIf S0 attempts to reach (1, 2), the fastest path is:\n(2, 4) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (1, 2). (5 moves minimum, highly unlikely)\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT to (1, 2) to eat the apple is the safest and most optimal move.\n\n**3. Move Choice: LEFT**\n\nThis move instantly ties me for the lead in the running score (9-9) and increases my length, making future movement more restrictive for S0 in the central-west area.\n\n**4. Alternative consideration (UP to (2, 3))**\nIf I move UP to (2, 3):\nS0 at (2, 4) could move DOWN to (2, 3) for a Head-on collision. This is a possibility. S0 might recognize that (1, 2) is lost and try to block me from advancing quickly north or east toward (7, 3).\nS0 is close to me, and moving towards S0's Y coordinate range is inherently risky. (2, 3) is one step closer to S0's current location (2, 4).\n\nSince LEFT (to 1, 2) is an EAT move, it guarantees a score and is safe from S0 unless S0 could somehow reach (1, 2) in 1 move, which it cannot.\n\n**Final Decision:** Move LEFT to secure the apple (1, 2).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n1. Secure (1, 2) by moving LEFT. Score 9. Length 10.\n2. Given S0 is moving North/East (currently at (2, 4)), my next target should be (7, 3), or potentially (9, 5) if S0 continues North.\n3. T=36: After eating (1, 2), my head is (1, 2), body starts at (2, 2). I need to move RIGHT (2, 2) or UP (1, 3) depending on S0's move (likely towards (2, 5) or (3, 4)). If (7, 3) is open, I will head east.\n\nLEFT",

(Empty floor).\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 2):** Into my body segment, (2, 2). KILLS ME.\n\nSafe Moves: UP (1, 3), DOWN (1, 1), LEFT (0, 2).\n\n**2. Evaluate Enemy Position and Targets**\n\nEnemy Snake #0 is at (3, 4).\nApples: (5, 9), (9, 5), (8, 9), (7, 3), (5, 6).\n\nS0 is relatively central. The distance to the nearest apples:\n*   (5, 6): Manhattan distance 4 + 2 = 6 moves.\n*   (7, 3): Manhattan distance 4 + 1 = 5 moves. (Looks like S0's primary target direction).\n*   (5, 9): Manhattan distance 2 + 5 = 7 moves.\n\nS0 is likely heading towards (7, 3) or continuing north/east toward the cluster of apples. Possible moves for S0 from (3, 4):\n1. UP to (3, 5): Safe. Good path to (5, 6) or (7, 3).\n2. RIGHT to (4, 4): Safe. Good path to (7, 3).\n3. DOWN to (3, 3): Safe. Direct path to (7, 3).\n4. LEFT to (2, 4): Into S0's body. KILLS S0. (Impossible).\n\nS0 will probably move UP, RIGHT, or DOWN, aiming for the eastern apples.\n\n**3. Optimal Move Selection for Snake 1 (at (1, 2))**\n\nWe are now focused on accessing the remaining apples, primarily (7, 3) or the northern ones. We need to move East to get past our own long body segments running along X=2, Y=0 to Y=2.\n\n*   **Option UP (1, 3):** Puts us closer to S0's domain slightly, but keeps us progressing North. If we move UP, we can then go East (2, 3), and then cross East rapidly towards (7, 3).\n*   **Option DOWN (1, 1):** Retreats slightly. Leads to (0, 1) or (2, 1) [body]. Not productive for accessing current apples quickly.\n*   **Option LEFT (0, 2):** Retreats to the wall. Not productive, creates a dead end scenario.\n\nWe must move UP (1, 3). This is the only move that maintains forward momentum and opens up the path to the east.\n\n**4. Conflict Check (Moving UP to (1, 3))**\nCould S0 interfere? S0 is at (3, 4).\nS0 cannot reach (1, 3) in one move.\n\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (3, 3), that is 2 squares away.\nIf S0 moves UP to (3, 5) or RIGHT to (4, 4), S0 is moving away or parallel.\n\n(1, 3) is a safe move.\n\n**5. Next Steps Planning**\nFrom (1, 3), we need to bypass our own body blocks (especially at (2, 2) and (2, 1)).\nIf we move UP (1, 3), the next move should be RIGHT (2, 3) to clear the column X=1 and X=2 blocks, assuming (2, 3) is free.\n(2, 3) is currently empty.\n\nPath: (1, 2) -> UP (1, 3) -> RIGHT (2, 3) -> UP/RIGHT towards (7, 3).\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue moving North/East to reach the apples at (7, 3) or (5, 6), prioritizing (7, 3) as it currently seems less contested by S0. Given our extensive body in the SW quadrant, we must clear the internal congestion quickly.\n\nUP",

Good.\n\nAll safe moves have good mobility.\n\n**Strategic choice:**  \nI want to move toward (5, 6) or (7, 3).  \nRIGHT moves me closer to both.  \nUP moves me toward (5, 6) but slightly away from (7, 3).  \nDOWN moves me toward (7, 3) but away from (5, 6).\n\nSince (5, 6) is closer, and enemy is on the left side far away, I can safely go RIGHT then UP toward it.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove RIGHT now to (4, 4).

Target Evaluation (Apple (7, 3) and (5, 6))**\n\nThe only safe move is RIGHT to (3, 3).\n\nApple (7, 3) is 4 Manhattan Distance (MD) away from (3, 3).\nApple (5, 6) is 5 MD away from (3, 3).\n\nEnemy Snake #0 is at (5, 4). S0 is moving towards the eastern apples.\nS0 potential moves from (5, 4):\n1. UP to (5, 5): Safe. Good for (5, 6).\n2. DOWN to (5, 3): Safe. Good for (7, 3).\n3. RIGHT to (6, 4): Safe. Good for (7, 3).\n4. LEFT to (4, 4): Into S0's body. KILLS S0.\n\nS0 is likely targeting (5, 6) or (7, 3).\nIf S0 goes to (5, 3), they are 2 squares from (7, 3).\nIf S0 goes to (6, 4), they are 3 squares from (7, 3).\nIf S0 goes to (5, 5), they are 1 square from (5, 6).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 3), I am advancing towards (7, 3).\n\n**3. Conflict Check (Moving RIGHT to (3, 3))**\n\nI move to (3, 3).\nS0 moves to (5, X) or (6, 4). No immediate head-on collision risk at (3, 3) or adjacent cells.\n\n*   If S0 goes to (5, 3) (DOWN), they challenge me for (7, 3). I am at (3, 3). S0 is at (5, 3). We are well separated.\n*   If S0 goes to (5, 5) (UP), they challenge me for (5, 6).\n\nMoving right to (3, 3) is the only option and it aligns with the strategic goal of going East to chase apples.\n\n**4. Long-Term Plan (T=39 onwards):**\nFrom (3, 3), I have three safe directions: UP (3, 4 - blocked by S0 body if S0 moves up/right), DOWN (3, 2), RIGHT (4, 3).\nWait, I need to check if (3, 4) is blocked by S0 body. S0 body is [(4, 4), (3, 4), (2, 4)...]. Yes, (3, 4) is S0 body.\nSo from (3, 3), I must go DOWN or RIGHT.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 3), I continue maneuvering towards (7, 3).\nIf I go DOWN to (3, 2), I might get stuck behind my tail later, but could potentially try to go under the enemy blockage.\n\nGiven the apple (7, 3) is at my current Y level, continuing RIGHT seems best.\n\nMove: RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #1 likely moves RIGHT to (3,3) (only safe move for them), so no head-on collision risk with any of our safe moves.\n\nApple distances from (5,4): (5,6)=2, (7,3)=3, others farther. UP improves distance to (5,6) from 2 to 1 and also improves (5,9) and (9,5), though it worsens (7,3). DOWN only improves (7,3). RIGHT improves (7,3) and far apples but worsens (5,6). UP positions us to eat (5,6) next turn, closing the apple gap (8 vs 9). All safe moves offer 3 follow-up options. UP avoids immediate competition with enemy for (7,3) and is the most direct path to the closest apple.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nAfter moving UP to (5,5), prioritize eating apple (5,6) by moving UP if safe. Then consider moving toward (5,9) or (9,5) while monitoring enemy movement toward (7,3). Maintain open escape routes and avoid dead ends near top wall.\n\nUP",

Enemy Analysis (Snake #0 at (5, 5))**\nS0 is closer to (5, 6) (1 move away) and (7, 3) (2 moves away via (6, 5) or (5, 6)->(6, 6)->(7, 6)->...).\n\nS0 potential moves from (5, 5):\n1.

Good for (9, 5) or potentially circling down for (7, 3).\n\nIf S0 goes UP to (5, 6) (most likely), they collect A2.\nIf S0 goes RIGHT to (6, 5): They head towards A3 (9, 5) or A1 (7, 3).\nIf S0 goes LEFT to (4, 5): They are moving away from all apples.\n\nWe must assume S0 takes (5, 6). This means A2 is gone. Our primary target remains A1 (7, 3).\n\n**4. Move Selection**\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 3):\nI am getting closer to (7, 3). Next turn, I will likely target (5, 3) or (4, 4) (Wait, (4, 4) is S0 body).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (3, 2):\nI am moving into a tight area near my own body and away from the nearest apple. This is suboptimal.\n\nLet's stick with RIGHT to (4, 3).\n\n**5. Collision Check (Moving RIGHT to (4, 3))**\nMy new head position: (4, 3).\nS0 new head position: Likely (5, 6).\nNo collision risk.\n\nIf S0 unexpectedly moves RIGHT to (6, 5), they are still far from me.\nIf S0 unexpectedly moves LEFT to (4, 5), collision is impossible as (4, 3) and (4, 5) are separate.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 3) keeps me advancing towards (7, 3) and keeps my options open (UP/RIGHT/DOWN from (4, 3)).\n\n*Future Plan:*\nIf I land at (4, 3) and S0 takes (5, 6), I will continue right towards (7, 3).

Target Evaluation**\nTarget A4 (7, 3) is the closest apple.\nMD from (4, 3) to (7, 3) = 3.\n\n*   Move RIGHT to (5, 3): MD remaining = 2.\n*   Move DOWN to (4, 2): MD remaining = 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nMoving RIGHT is the quickest path to A4 (7, 3).\n\n**3. Enemy Analysis (Snake #0 at (5, 6))**\nS0 is also positioned well for A4 (7, 3).\nS0 MD to A4 (7, 3): (7-5) + (6-3) = 2 + 3 = 5 moves.\nMy MD to A4 (7, 3): (7-4) + (3-3) = 3 moves. I have a significant distance advantage.\n\nS0 potential moves from (5, 6):\n1. UP to (5, 7): Safe. Headed towards A1 (5, 9) or A3 (8, 9).\n2. DOWN to (5, 5): Into S0 body. KILLS S0.\n3. LEFT to (4, 6): Safe. Headed towards A5 (0, 8).\n4. RIGHT to (6, 6): Safe. Headed towards A3 (8, 9) or A2 (9, 5).\n\nS0 is currently oriented towards the top apples (A1, A3, A5). If they continue UP/RIGHT/LEFT, they will prioritize those. Given the proximity of A1 (5, 9) (3 moves UP) and A3 (8, 9), S0 is unlikely to dedicate 5 moves to reach A4 (7, 3).\n\nWe should capitalize on our advantage for A4 (7, 3).\n\n**4. Move Selection: RIGHT to (5, 3)**\n\nThis move advances us directly towards our local target A4 (7, 3). Our path will likely be (4, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (6, 3) -> (7, 3).\n\n**5. Collision Check (Moving RIGHT to (5, 3))**\nMy new head position: (5, 3).\nS0 new head position: Likely (5, 7), (4, 6), or (6, 6).\n\nIf S0 moves UP to (5, 7): No collision.\nIf S0 moves LEFT to (4, 6): No collision.\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (6, 6): No collision.\n\nIf S0 were to aim for me, they would need to move far DOWN. (5, 6) -> (5, 5) (suicide) or (6, 5) or (4, 5). Even if S0 moved to (6, 5) or (4, 5), my position at (5, 3) is safe.\n\nMoving RIGHT is the optimal, safe, and aggressive move.\n\n**Future Plan:**\nNext turn, from (5, 3), I will move RIGHT to (6, 3), and then RIGHT to (7, 3) to collect the apple A4. This seems straightforward unless S0 makes an extremely unexpected and aggressive long move DOWN towards (7, 3), which is unlikely given their current position and apple options.\n\nRIGHT",

Apple proximity**  \nApples: (5, 9), (9, 5), (8, 9), (7, 3), (0, 8)  \nFrom my head (5, 6):  \n- (5, 9) \u2192 3 steps up.  \n- (9, 5) \u2192 4 steps right, 1 down.  \n- (8, 9) \u2192 3 right, 3 up.  \n- (7, 3) \u2192 2 right, 3 down.  \n- (0, 8) \u2192 5 left, 2 up.\n\nClosest is (5, 9) directly above.

Future safety after each move**  \n\n**UP to (5, 7)**:  \nFrom (5, 7), possible next moves:  \n- UP to (5, 8) \u2013 empty.  \n- DOWN back to (5, 6) \u2013 but tail might move away? Let\u2019s see: My tail is at (1, 7) now. If I move UP, tail stays at (1, 7) until I eat apple. So (5, 6) will be empty next turn if I don\u2019t grow. Actually, check: My body length is 10 segments (head + 9 body parts). Apples collected: 9. So my length = 10. Currently head at (5,6), tail at (1,7). If I move without eating, tail moves forward one cell (to next body segment in list), so (1,7) becomes empty. So (5,6) will be empty next turn.  \nSo from (5,7), DOWN next turn is safe.  \nLEFT to (4,7) \u2013 empty.  \nRIGHT to (6,7) \u2013 empty.  \nSo from (5,7), all 4 directions possible next turn (assuming no enemy blocks then). Good.\n\n**LEFT to (4, 6)**:  \nFrom (4,6), possible next moves:  \nUP to (4,7) \u2013 empty.  \nDOWN to (4,5) \u2013 my body? Check: body has (5,5) and (5,4), (4,4), etc. (4,5) not in body. So empty.  \nLEFT to (3,6) \u2013 empty.  \nRIGHT back to (5,6) \u2013 empty next turn as said.  \nAlso all 4 directions possible. Slightly further from (5,9) apple.\n\n**RIGHT to (6, 6)**:  \nFrom (6,6), possible next moves:  \nUP to (6,7) \u2013 empty.  \nDOWN to (6,5) \u2013 empty (A at (9,5) far away).  \nLEFT back to (5,6) \u2013 empty next turn.  \nRIGHT to (7,6) \u2013 empty.  \nAlso all 4 directions possible. Moves me toward (9,5) and (8,9) but farther from (5,9).\n\n---\n\n**6. Enemy\u2019s likely move**  \nEnemy at (4,3). Apples nearby: (7,3) is 3 steps right, (5,9) far.  \nEnemy might go RIGHT toward (7,3) apple.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (5,3), that\u2019s still far from me.\n\n---\n\n**7. Long-term plan**  \n(5,9) is closest apple. Go UP to get it. After eating, length increases, tail stays, so (1,7) stays occupied longer, but that\u2019s far from me. Need to avoid trapping myself after growing.\n\nGiven all safe moves, UP is best for immediate apple, keeps options open.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn**:  \nAfter eating apple at (5,9) if possible, be careful not to box self in top row. Next turn after UP, consider moving LEFT/RIGHT along top to avoid dead end.\n\n---\n\nUP",

Heading towards A3 (8, 9).\n\nS0's most logical move is UP to (5, 8) to secure A1 (5, 9). S0 is highly unlikely to move horizontally or downward in a way that interferes with my current short path to (7, 3).\n\nIf S0 moves UP: (5, 8). No collision threat.\nIf I move RIGHT: (6, 3).

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation step-by-step.  \n\n**Current head:** (5, 7)  \n**Body after head:** (5, 6)  \n**Available moves:**  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 8)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 6) \u2192 own body \u2192 illegal  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 7)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 7)  \n\nSo UP, LEFT, RIGHT are legal.  \n\n---\n\n**1. Immediate danger check**  \nCheck board state for (5,8), (4,7), (6,7):  \n- (5,8): empty in board representation.  \n- (4,7): empty.  \n- (6,7): empty.  \n\nNo immediate collision with enemy body either (enemy body ends at (3,0), etc., far away).  \n\n---\n\n**2. Possible enemy moves**  \nEnemy head at (5, 3).  \nEnemy possible moves:  \n- UP to (5,4) \u2192 my body at (5,4) \u2192 enemy dies if it goes there.  \n- DOWN to (5,2) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT to (4,3) \u2192 enemy\u2019s own body at (4,3) \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT to (6,3) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: DOWN or RIGHT.  \n\nCould enemy reach my possible next positions this turn? No, enemy is at y=3, I\u2019m at y=7.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Head-on collision risk**  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (6,3), I go RIGHT to (6,7) \u2192 no conflict.  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (5,2), no conflict.  \nNo possible same-cell collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Apple proximity**  \nApples: (5,9), (9,5), (8,9), (7,3), (0,8)  \nFrom my head (5,7):  \n- (5,9): 2 steps up (UP, UP) \u2192 closest apple.  \n- (8,9): 3 right, 2 up.  \n- (9,5): 4 right, 2 down.  \n- (7,3): 2 right, 4 down.  \n- (0,8): 5 left, 1 up.  \n\nUP moves directly toward (5,9).  \n\n---\n\n**5. Future safety after each move**  \n\n**UP to (5,8)**:  \nNext turn from (5,8): possible moves:  \nUP to (5,9) \u2192 apple, safe unless enemy somehow gets there (impossible this turn).  \nLEFT to (4,8) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT to (6,8) \u2192 empty.  \nDOWN to (5,7) \u2192 will be empty next turn (tail currently at (1,6) moves to (1,5)).  \nSo 4 directions open.  \n\n**LEFT to (4,7)**:  \nNext turn from (4,7):  \nUP to (4,8) \u2192 empty.  \nDOWN to (4,6) \u2192 empty (my old head at (5,6) but tail moving away).  \nLEFT to (3,7) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT to (5,7) \u2192 empty.  \nAlso 4 directions open.  \n\n**RIGHT to (6,7)**:  \nNext turn from (6,7):  \nUP to (6,8) \u2192 empty.  \nDOWN to (6,6) \u2192 empty.  \nLEFT to (5,7) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT to (7,7) \u2192 empty.  \nAlso 4 directions open.  \n\nAll safe moves keep options open.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term considerations**  \nEating (5,9) soon is good because:  \n- It grows me, increasing lead if enemy doesn\u2019t eat.  \n- Enemy might go for (7,3) apple next, which is closer to them.  \n- After eating apple at (5,9), I\u2019ll be at top row; need to avoid getting stuck there. Next turn after UP now, I can go UP again to eat apple, then move horizontally to avoid dead end.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go UP now to (5,8), next turn I can:  \n- If enemy far, go UP to (5,9) to eat apple, then likely move LEFT/RIGHT along top row to escape.  \n- If enemy somehow threatens (5,9), I can avoid and go LEFT/RIGHT from (5,8) to stay safe.  \n\nUP seems best for shortest path to apple while keeping options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP",

Enemy Analysis (Snake #0 at (5, 8))**\n\nS0 is currently positioned at (5, 8). Apple A1 is at (5, 9), one step away.\nS0 potential moves from (5, 8):\n1. **UP to (5, 9):** Collects A1. Score 10. This is the most likely move.\n2. **DOWN to (5, 7):** Into S0 body. KILLS S0 (Moving directly backwards).\n3. **LEFT to (4, 8):** Safe. Heading towards A5 (0, 8).\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 8):** Safe. Heading towards A3 (8, 9).\n\nAssuming S0 moves UP to (5, 9) to collect A1, there is no collision threat with my move to (7, 3).\n\n**4. Move Selection: RIGHT to (7, 3)**\n\nThis move collects the apple A4.\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan (T=43 onwards):**\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 3) and S0 moves UP to (5, 9), the scores will be 10-10.\nAfter T=42 (eating A4), my head will be at (7, 3). My new tail will be at (2, 1) (since I ate an apple).\n\nRemaining Apples: A2 (9, 5), A3 (8, 9), A5 (0, 8).\nFrom (7, 3):\n*   MD to A2 (9, 5): |9-7| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4 moves (e.g., R, R, U, U).\n*   MD to A3 (8, 9): |8-7| + |9-3| = 1 + 6 = 7 moves.\n*   MD to A5 (0, 8): |0-7| + |8-3| = 7 + 5 = 12 moves.\n\nS0 (likely at (5, 9)):\n*   MD to A3 (8, 9): |8-5| + |9-9| = 3 moves (e.g., R, R, R).\n*   MD to A5 (0, 8): |0-5| + |8-9| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves.\n*   MD to A2 (9, 5): |9-5| + |5-9| = 4 + 4 = 8 moves.\n\nIt appears S0 has a significant advantage reaching A3 (8, 9), only 3 moves away, while A2 (9, 5) is also somewhat accessible for me.\n\nMy next move (T=43) should be aimed at A2 (9, 5) to minimize competition with S0, which is likely heading towards A3 (8, 9).\nFrom (7, 3), I should move UP or RIGHT. RIGHT to (8, 3) is a good starting point for A2.\n\nThis turn, RIGHT is the only move.\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Although UP limits next turn to two moves (LEFT or RIGHT from top row), enemy is distant (head at (6,3)), so immediate danger is low. LEFT and RIGHT preserve more options but delay apple collection.

Tail (1, 5).\n\n**Objective:** Prioritize safe moves that lead toward apples, ideally A1 (9, 5) or A4 (7, 2).\n\n**Apple Distances (Manhattan Distance from (7, 3)):**\n*   A1 (9, 5): |9-7| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4 (Path: R, R, U, U)\n*   A4 (7, 2): |7-7| + |2-3| = 0 + 1 = 1 (Path: DOWN)\n*   A5 (4, 7): |4-7| + |7-3| = 3 + 4 = 7\n*   A2 (8, 9): |8-7| + |9-3| = 1 + 6 = 7\n*   A3 (0, 8): |0-7| + |8-3| = 7 + 5 = 12\n\nA4 (7, 2) is the closest apple (1 step DOWN).

Heading potentially towards A3 (0, 8).\n*   RIGHT to (6, 9): Safe. Heading potentially towards A2 (8, 9).\n\nS0 is likely to move LEFT (4, 9) or RIGHT (6, 9).\n\n**1. Immediate Safety Check (from (7, 3))**\n\n*   **UP to (7, 4):** Safe (empty cell).\n*   **DOWN to (7, 2):** Apple A4.\n    *   (7, 2) is currently empty. No collision risk or body entry. **BEST MOVE.**\n*   **LEFT to (6, 3):** Into my body segment, (6, 3). KILLS ME (Moving directly backwards).\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 3):** Safe (empty cell). Leads towards A1 (9, 5).\n\nSafe Moves: UP (7, 4), DOWN (7, 2), RIGHT (8, 3).\n\n**2. Evaluate Priority Moves**\n\n**Move DOWN to (7, 2):** Collects Apple A4. This is a guaranteed score increase and is entirely safe from collision with S0, as S0 is far away (MD 7 steps).\n\nIf I move DOWN, my head will be at (7, 2). My new tail will be (3, 3) (since I collected A4 and grew).\n\n**3. Long-Term Strategy Post-A4 (T=44 onwards):**\nIf I collect A4, my score is 11.\nMy head is at (7, 2).\n\nRemaining Apples: A1 (9, 5), A2 (8, 9), A3 (0, 8), A5 (4, 7).\n\nDistances from (7, 2):\n*   A1 (9, 5): |9-7| + |5-2| = 2 + 3 = 5\n*   A5 (4, 7): |4-7| + |7-2| = 3 + 5 = 8\n*   A2 (8, 9): |8-7| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nS0 is likely at (4, 9) or (6, 9). Both are closer to A2 (8, 9) than I am, but A1 (9, 5) seems accessible for me. From (7, 2), I can move UP towards A1 (9, 5) or RIGHT towards the boundary to approach A1.\n\nMoving DOWN to (7, 2) is the optimal, safe, and scoring move for this turn.\n\n**4.

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state.  \n\n**Current board:**  \n- My snake head: (5, 9)  \n- My body: [(5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)]  \n- Enemy snake #1 head: (7, 3), body: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0)]  \n- Apples: (9,5), (8,9), (0,8), (7,2), (4,7)  \n\n**Last turn:** I moved UP from (5,8) to (5,9), which was an apple cell. That means I grew by 1 segment this turn, so my tail didn\u2019t move \u2014 my new body should be: head at (5,9), then old head (5,8) becomes second segment, and so on. Actually, let's reconstruct:  \nBefore last move: head (5,8), body segments: (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5) (tail).  \nI moved UP to (5,9), ate apple \u2192 new head (5,9), previous head becomes second segment, tail stays same length (no shift). So current body is: [(5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5)]? Wait, length before was 10 segments (head + 9 body). After eating apple, length becomes 11 segments (head + 10 body). That means tail (1,5) is still there, but the segment before tail was (1,4). So yes, body now: head (5,9), then (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (1,5).  \n\nBut the game display shows at (5,9) my head '0', at (5,8) 'T', etc.  \n\n**Now possible moves from (5,9):**  \n- UP: (5,10) \u2192 off board \u2192 illegal.  \n- DOWN: (5,8) \u2192 my own body (second segment) \u2192 illegal.  \n- LEFT: (4,9) \u2192 empty in board display, safe unless enemy moves there.  \n- RIGHT: (6,9) \u2192 empty in board display, safe unless enemy moves there.  \n\n**Enemy possible moves from (7,3):**  \nEnemy body: [(6,3), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0)]  \nEnemy safe moves: UP (7,4), DOWN (7,2) has apple, LEFT (6,3) own body \u2192 no, RIGHT (8,3) empty. So enemy can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \nEnemy might go DOWN to (7,2) for apple, but that's risky if I go there? I'm far away.  \n\n**Apples reachable:**  \nFrom my position (5,9):  \n- (8,9) is 3 steps right.  \n- (9,5) is 4 steps right + 4 down, far.  \n- (0,8) far left.  \n- (7,2) far.  \n- (4,7) is 2 left + 2 down, but blocked by my body? Let's check path: (5,9) \u2192 (4,9) \u2192 (4,8) \u2192 (4,7) possible if first move LEFT.  \n\n**Safety check:**  \nLEFT to (4,9):  \n- Next turn, from (4,9), possible moves: UP off, DOWN (4,8) empty, LEFT (3,9) empty, RIGHT (5,9) my old head now body \u2014 illegal next turn. So 2 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT).  \n- Could enemy reach (4,9) this turn? Enemy at (7,3) \u2192 (6,3) is own body, so enemy can't go LEFT to (6,3). To reach (4,9), impossible in 1 turn. So safe from enemy head collision this turn.  \n- No other snakes.  \n\nRIGHT to (6,9):  \n- Next turn, from (6,9): UP off, DOWN (6,8) empty, LEFT (5,9) my body, RIGHT (7,9) empty. So 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT).  \n- Enemy can't reach (6,9) in 1 turn.  \n\nBoth LEFT and RIGHT safe this turn.  \n\n**Which is better?**  \nLEFT leads toward apple (4,7) in 3 moves, also (0,8) eventually.  \nRIGHT leads toward apple (8,9) in 3 moves, also (9,5) eventually.  \n\nBut (4,7) is closer in Manhattan distance from (4,9):  \nFrom (4,9) to (4,7): 2 steps down, both cells currently empty? (4,8) empty, (4,7) apple. But my body occupies (5,7), (5,6), etc., not blocking (4,7) path except if enemy moves there.  \n\nFrom (6,9) to (8,9): 2 steps right, both cells empty except (7,9) and (8,9) apple.  \n\nEnemy is at (7,3), moving toward (7,2) apple maybe. Enemy far from (8,9) and (4,7).  \n\n**Future options:**  \nLEFT to (4,9) leaves me near top-left area, my body blocks column 5 mostly, so I can go down column 4 safely.  \nRIGHT to (6,9) leaves me near top-right area, my body blocks column 5, so I can go down column 6 safely.  \n\nI should avoid trapping myself. Currently at top row, so going DOWN next turn is wise. But I must move LEFT or RIGHT now to leave top row next turn.  \n\nActually, if I go LEFT to (4,9), next turn I can go DOWN to (4,8), then LEFT/DOWN to (3,8) or (4,7). That keeps options.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,9), next turn DOWN to (6,8), then RIGHT/DOWN to (7,8) or (6,7).  \n\nBoth fine. But apple (8,9) is closer in steps from right path:  \nFrom (6,9): (6,9)\u2192(7,9)\u2192(8,9) eats apple in 2 moves.  \nFrom (4,9) to (8,9) takes 4 moves.  \n\nApple (4,7) from (4,9): (4,9)\u2192(4,8)\u2192(4,7) eats apple in 2 moves.  \n\nSo each move leads to a different nearest apple.  \n\nLet's check safety of path to apple:  \nTo (4,7): after LEFT now, next turn DOWN to (4,8), then DOWN to (4,7) apple. Is (4,8) safe next turn? Yes unless enemy moves there, but enemy at (7,3) can't reach (4,8) in 2 turns? Actually next turn enemy could be at (7,2), (7,4), or (8,3). None threaten (4,8) next turn. Safe.  \n\nTo (8,9): after RIGHT now, next turn DOWN to (6,8), then RIGHT to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,9). Takes 3 moves to eat, not 2 \u2014 correction: from (6,9), DOWN to (6,8), RIGHT to (7,8), RIGHT to (8,9) is 3 moves.  \nBut from (6,9), RIGHT to (7,9), RIGHT to (8,9) is 2 moves but (7,9) then (8,9) \u2014 but from (6,9) can't go RIGHT twice without going DOWN first? Actually:  \nTurn now: go RIGHT to (6,9)? Wait I'm at (5,9). If I go RIGHT to (6,9), then next turn from (6,9) I can go RIGHT to (7,9), then next turn RIGHT to (8,9) eats apple. So 3 moves total.  \n\nSo (4,7) is 2 moves away after LEFT now, (8,9) is 3 moves away after RIGHT now. So LEFT gives quicker apple.  \n\nAlso, enemy might go for (7,2) apple, leaving (4,7) free.  \n\n**Collision risk this turn:**  \nCould enemy go to (4,9)? No.  \nCould enemy go to (6,9)? No.  \nSo both safe.  \n\nI'll choose LEFT to get apple faster and stay near left side where my body is, giving me more escape routes downward later.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (4,9), go DOWN to (4,8), then toward apple (4,7) unless enemy threatens. Keep eye on enemy at (7,3)/(7,2).  \n\nLEFT",

Evaluate Priority Moves towards A1 (9, 5)**\n\nA1 is 5 MD away. (9, 5) is reachable via (8, 2) -> (9, 2) -> (9, 3) -> (9, 4) -> (9, 5) (5 steps: R, R, U, U, U).\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (8, 2):**\n    *   Safe. Keeps me on the bottom right quadrant, clear of S0 for now.\n    *   Puts me closer to A1 (9, 5). New MD: 4.\n\n*   **Move DOWN (7, 1):**\n    *   Safe. Takes me further from A1 (MD 6). Puts me closer to A5 (1, 0) (MD 7).\n    *   This is okay for exploring the bottom edge but delays pursuing the currently closest apple.\n\n*   **Move LEFT (6, 2):**\n    *   Safe. MD to A1 increases to 5. MD to A4 (4, 7) decreases to 7.\n    *   Moving LEFT brings me closer to the center of the board where S0 is operating (if S0 moves down to (4, 8)).\n\n**Collision Check:**\nMy head is at (7, 2). S0 is at (4, 9). They are widely separated. No immediate collision risk.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe best move is RIGHT (8, 2) to continue positioning myself aggressively for A1 (9, 5). A1 is the only apple I appear to have a clear advantage on, as S0 is strongly positioned for A2 or A4.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:**\nMove towards A1 (9, 5). From (8, 2), the path is UP, RIGHT, UP, UP, UP. Or RIGHT, UP, UP, UP, UP (if using (9, 2)). (9, 5) is 4 steps away. Next move should target (9, 2) or (8, 3). Since (9, 2) is empty, moving RIGHT next turn to (9, 2) seems optimal.\n\nRIGHT",

So enemy can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Collision risk this turn:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (4,8), enemy could move to (6,2), (7,1), or (8,2). None threaten (4,8).  \nIf I go LEFT to (3,9), enemy cannot reach (3,9) in one move.  \nBoth safe from immediate enemy head collision.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nFrom (4,9):  \n- (4,7) is 2 steps down (via (4,8)).  \n- (8,9) is 4 steps right + 0 vertical, but my RIGHT is blocked now.  \n- (0,8) far left.  \n- (9,5) far.  \n- (1,0) far.  \n\nClosest apple is (4,7) \u2192 DOWN gets me closer.  \n\n**Future mobility:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (4,8): next turn I can go DOWN to (4,7) apple, LEFT to (3,8), or RIGHT to (5,8) (my body at (5,8) will shift? Wait: my tail will move if I don\u2019t eat apple this turn. Currently my tail is at (1,4). Next turn if I move DOWN to (4,8) and don\u2019t eat apple, tail moves to (2,4)? Actually: my body is head (4,9), then (5,9), (5,8), \u2026, (1,4). After moving DOWN to (4,8), new head (4,8), then (4,9), (5,9), (5,8), \u2026, (2,4) tail. So (5,8) becomes (5,9) after shift? Let\u2019s check: current segment list:  \n0: (4,9) head  \n1: (5,9)  \n2: (5,8)  \n3: (5,7)  \n\u2026  \nAfter moving DOWN: new head (4,8), then old head (4,9) becomes segment 1, (5,9) becomes segment 2, (5,8) becomes segment 3, etc., tail (1,4) disappears. So (5,8) will be occupied by my body segment 3 next turn, so moving RIGHT from (4,8) to (5,8) would be into my own body next turn. So from (4,8), safe moves next turn: DOWN to (4,7) apple, LEFT to (3,8) empty, UP to (4,9) body (illegal). So DOWN or LEFT only. That\u2019s only 2 safe moves, but DOWN leads to apple.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,9): next turn from (3,9) safe moves: DOWN (3,8) empty, LEFT (2,9) empty, RIGHT (4,9) my body (illegal), UP off board. So DOWN or LEFT only. That\u2019s also 2 safe moves.  \n\nBoth give same immediate safe move count next turn.  \n\n**Enemy threat to apple (4,7):**  \nEnemy at (7,2) is 5 steps away from (4,7) in Manhattan distance. I can reach (4,7) in 2 moves (DOWN now, DOWN next). Enemy would need 5 moves minimum, so I can get there first.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nGet apple (4,7) next turn, then consider moving left toward (0,8) or down toward (1,0). Avoid moving into column 5 where my body blocks. Keep enemy head far away; enemy is currently bottom/middle right.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nDOWN gets me toward closest apple quickly, keeps options open afterward (can go left or further down after eating apple). LEFT keeps me on top row longer, delaying apple access.  \n\nDOWN\n\n**Next turn plan:** From (4,8), go DOWN to (4,7) to eat apple unless enemy threatens (4,7) \u2014 but enemy too far. Then after eating, head to (3,7) or (4,6) to avoid trapping myself.  \n\nDOWN",

If it does, my plan to avoid S0 in the middle is good.\n\n**1. Immediate Safety Check (from (8, 2))**\n\n*   **UP to (8, 3):** Safe (empty cell). Leads towards A1 (9, 5).\n*   **DOWN to (8, 1):** Safe (empty cell).\n*   **LEFT to (7, 2):** Into my body segment. KILLS ME (Moving directly backwards).\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 2):** Safe (empty cell). Leads towards A1 (9, 5).\n\nSafe Moves: UP (8, 3), DOWN (8, 1), RIGHT (9, 2).\n\n**2. Evaluate Priority Moves towards A1 (9, 5)**\n\nA1 (9, 5) is 4 MD away.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (9, 2):**\n    *   Safe. Puts me 1 cell closer to the X coordinate of A1. New MD: 1 (X) + 3 (Y) = 4. (No benefit in MD, but positions me on the edge for vertical movement.)\n    *   From (9, 2), I can move UP to (9, 3) next turn (MD 3).\n\n*   **Move UP (8, 3):**\n    *   Safe. Puts me 1 cell closer to the Y coordinate of A1. New MD: 1 (X) + 2 (Y) = 3. (Best MD benefit).\n    *   From (8, 3), I can move UP to (8, 4) or RIGHT to (9, 3) next turn. Moving RIGHT (9, 3) makes A1 2 MD (1 step).\n\n*   **Move DOWN (8, 1):**\n    *   Safe. MD to A1 increases to 5. Less favorable for A1.\n\n**Decision based on Apple Pursuit (A1 (9, 5)):**\nMoving UP (8, 3) offers the best immediate reduction in Manhattan Distance to A1 (9, 5).\n\nIf I choose UP (8, 3):\nT+1: H (8, 3). Next move options: UP (8, 4), RIGHT (9, 3), DOWN (8, 2), LEFT (7, 3 - body). (8, 4) is 3 MD away. (9, 3) is 2 MD away. Moving RIGHT to (9, 3) looks great.\n\nIf I choose RIGHT (9, 2):\nT+1: H (9, 2). Next move options: UP (9, 3), DOWN (9, 1), LEFT (8, 2 - body). (9, 3) is 2 MD away.\n\nBoth UP (8, 3) and RIGHT (9, 2) set up a move to (9, 3) by T+2, which is 2 steps from the apple.\n(8, 2) -> UP (8, 3) -> RIGHT (9, 3) (2 steps)\n(8, 2) -> RIGHT (9, 2) -> UP (9, 3) (2 steps)\n\nThe sequence (8, 2) -> UP (8, 3) is preferred because (9, 3) is 2 MD away from A1(9, 5), while (8, 3) is already only 3 MD away. It directly gains distance towards the apple compared to moving right, which keeps the MD stagnant.\n\nLet's check potential collisions. S0 is moving towards/eating A4 (4, 7). No collision risk.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:**\nMove UP to (8, 3). Next turn, pivot RIGHT to (9, 3). Target A1 (9, 5). This positions me perfectly to grab A1 possibly by T=48.\nT=45: (8, 3)\nT=46: (9, 3)\nT=47: (9, 4)\nT=48: (9, 5) [EAT]\n\nUP",

Possible moves from (4,7):**  \n- UP \u2192 (4,8) \u2192 occupied by my own body \u2192 death \u2192 eliminate.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,6) \u2192 currently empty on board, safe? Let\u2019s check:  \n  Board shows at (4,6) a \u2018.\u2019 (empty). No enemy body there.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 empty \u2018.\u2019  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,7) \u2192 occupied by my body (5,7 is part of my snake) \u2192 death \u2192 eliminate.  \n\nSo possible safe moves: DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**2. Enemy\u2019s possible moves from (8,3):**  \nEnemy head at (8,3), body at (8,2), (7,2), (7,3), (6,3), etc.  \nPossible for enemy: UP (8,4), DOWN (8,2) \u2192 own body, LEFT (7,3) \u2192 own body, RIGHT (9,3) \u2192 empty.  \nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP to (8,4), RIGHT to (9,3).  \n\n---\n\n**3. Collision risk:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (4,6), enemy heads possible moves: (8,4) or (9,3) \u2014 nowhere near (4,6). No head-on collision risk.  \nIf I go LEFT to (3,7), enemy heads nowhere near either.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Apples reachable:**  \nClosest apples to me:  \n- (9,5) \u2192 far (distance 5 in x, -2 in y)  \n- (8,9) \u2192 far  \n- (0,8) \u2192 far  \n- (1,0) \u2192 far  \n- (9,4) \u2192 far  \n\nNone are super close. From (4,7), DOWN (4,6) goes toward bottom half, but apples at (1,0) is far bottom-left, (0,8) top-left.  \nLEFT (3,7) goes toward left side.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Future mobility:**  \nFrom (4,6) next turn: can go UP (back to 4,7 but body will be there? Actually body will move forward if no apple eaten), LEFT (3,6), RIGHT (5,6) (occupied by my body currently? Wait, my body at (5,6) now, but next turn after moving DOWN, tail moves? Let\u2019s check: I ate no apple this turn, so tail moves forward from (2,4) to (3,4)? Actually snake moves: head to (4,6), each segment shifts, so tail segment (2,4) disappears, new body segment at old head (4,7) is now part of body. So (5,6) will be at index 5 in body list after move? Let\u2019s simulate: current body: head (4,7), then (4,8)... after moving DOWN without apple: new head (4,6), previous head (4,7) becomes new body[1], then (4,8) becomes body[2], ..., last body (2,4) is removed. So (5,6) is still in body next turn? Check: current body list: (4,8), (4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (4,4), (3,4), (2,4). After move: head to (4,6), body[1]=(4,7), body[2]=(4,8), body[3]=(4,9), body[4]=(5,9), body[5]=(5,8), body[6]=(5,7), body[7]=(5,6), body[8]=(5,5), body[9]=(5,4), body[10]=(4,4), body[11]=(3,4), tail removed was (2,4). So (5,6) is still occupied next turn (body[7]). So from (4,6) next turn: UP (4,7) occupied, DOWN (4,5) free, LEFT (3,6) free, RIGHT (5,6) occupied. So 2 moves free.  \n\nFrom (3,7) next turn: body shifts similarly: head to (3,7), old head (4,7) becomes body[1], then (4,8), etc. So from (3,7) next turn: check neighbors: UP (3,8) free, DOWN (3,6) free, LEFT (2,7) free, RIGHT (4,7) occupied. So 3 moves free.  \n\nLEFT gives more future mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term plan:**  \nWe\u2019re tied 11 apples with enemy. Need to survive and collect apples safely. Left side of board is less cluttered with enemy body (enemy is mostly bottom-left to middle). Moving LEFT opens path toward apple (0,8) or (1,0) eventually while keeping options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** LEFT gives better future mobility and is safe this turn.  \n\nLEFT",

Tail (3,4) gone.  \n\nNeighbors of (3,8):  \nUP (3,9) \u2192 '.' \u2192 free.  \nDOWN (3,7) \u2192 occupied by body[1] \u2192 no.  \nLEFT (2,8) \u2192 '.' \u2192 free.  \nRIGHT (4,8) \u2192 occupied by body[3] \u2192 no.  \nSo 2 moves free next turn.  \n\n**If LEFT to (2,7):**  \nNext turn body: head (2,7), body[1]=(3,7), body[2]=(4,7), body[3]=(4,8), body[4]=(4,9), body[5]=(5,9), body[6]=(5,8), body[7]=(5,7), body[8]=(5,6), body[9]=(5,5), body[10]=(5,4), body[11]=(4,4). Tail (3,4) gone.  \n\nNeighbors of (2,7):  \nUP (2,8) \u2192 '.' \u2192 free.  \nDOWN (2,6) \u2192 '.' \u2192 free.  \nLEFT (1,7) \u2192 '.' \u2192 free.  \nRIGHT (3,7) \u2192 occupied by body[1] \u2192 no.  \nSo 3 moves free next turn.  \n\n**If DOWN to (3,6):**  \nNext turn body: head (3,6), body[1]=(3,7), body[2]=(4,7), body[3]=(4,8), body[4]=(4,9), body[5]=(5,9), body[6]=(5,8), body[7]=(5,7), body[8]=(5,6), body[9]=(5,5), body[10]=(5,4), body[11]=(4,4). Tail (3,4) gone.  \n\nNeighbors of (3,6):  \nUP (3,7) \u2192 body[1] \u2192 no.  \nDOWN (3,5) \u2192 '.' \u2192 free.  \nLEFT (2,6) \u2192 '.' \u2192 free.  \nRIGHT (4,6) \u2192 '.' but body[8] is (5,6) now, not (4,6), so free. Wait, check: body[8]=(5,6) is not (4,6), so (4,6) is free. Actually body[8]=(5,6) is not adjacent to (3,6) in x=4,y=6? Let\u2019s check: from (3,6), right is (4,6), not (5,6). Yes, so (4,6) is free. So all except UP are free? That\u2019s 3 moves free.  \n\nSo DOWN also gives 3 moves free next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term plan:**  \nWe want apple (0,8). UP or LEFT both get closer equally in Manhattan distance.  \nLEFT opens more of the left side which is less cluttered by enemy (enemy\u2019s body is mostly bottom-left, but top-left is clear).  \nAlso, if enemy goes UP to (9,4) to eat apple, they will grow, but they\u2019ll be on the right side far away.  \n\nLEFT seems slightly better because it moves toward (0,8) and opens 3 moves next turn, while UP only opens 2 moves next turn and puts me closer to top edge (which can limit future moves).  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT  \n\nLEFT",

No, (2,7) to (3,6) is not adjacent (diagonal).  \n\nWait, from (2,7), DOWN is (2,6), then next turn RIGHT to (3,6) eats apple. But enemy could also get to (3,6) from (9,4) in 6 moves, so not immediate threat.\n\nBut maybe I can eat it sooner? From (2,7), no direct move reaches (3,6) this turn. So eating (3,6) requires 2 turns.\n\nClosest reachable apple in 1 turn:  \n- (0,8) \u2192 need UP or LEFT to get closer.  \n- (1,0) \u2192 far.  \n- (8,9) \u2192 far.  \n- (9,5) \u2192 far.  \n\nSo shortest Manhattan distance to an apple reachable in 1 move:  \nUP (2,8) \u2192 distance to (0,8) = 2.  \nLEFT (1,7) \u2192 distance to (0,8) = 1+1=2.  \nDOWN (2,6) \u2192 distance to (3,6) = 1.  \n\nActually DOWN gets me to (2,6), which is distance 1 from apple (3,6). So next turn I can eat it if still there.  \nBut enemy could also move toward (3,6), but they\u2019re far.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Future mobility after each move:**  \n\n**If DOWN to (2,6):**  \nNext turn body: head (2,6), body[1]=(2,7), body[2]=(3,7), body[3]=(4,7), body[4]=(4,8), body[5]=(4,9), body[6]=(5,9), body[7]=(5,8), body[8]=(5,7), body[9]=(5,6), body[10]=(5,5), body[11]=(5,4).

Let\u2019s check: enemy head at (9,4) \u2192 to (3,6) takes 6 moves minimum, so likely still there next turn. So (3,6) is free next turn if enemy doesn\u2019t reach it (they won\u2019t in 1 turn). So free.  \n\nSo DOWN gives 3 free moves next turn.\n\n**If LEFT to (1,7):**  \nNext turn body: head (1,7), body[1]=(2,7), body[2]=(3,7), body[3]=(4,7), body[4]=(4,8), body[5]=(4,9), body[6]=(5,9), body[7]=(5,8), body[8]=(5,7), body[9]=(5,6), body[10]=(5,5), body[11]=(5,4).

Wait, body[4]=(4,8), not (3,8). So (3,8) is free.  \nSo 3 free moves next turn.\n\nAll safe moves give 3 free moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**6. Apple (3,6) risk:**  \nIf I go DOWN to (2,6), next turn I can eat (3,6) unless enemy head moves into it this turn. Enemy head at (9,4) can\u2019t reach (3,6) in 1 move. So safe.  \nBut enemy could move toward it over multiple turns. However, I\u2019d get it next turn if I go DOWN now.  \n\nGoing LEFT or UP delays eating (3,6) by at least 2 turns, risking enemy getting it first.\n\n---\n\n**7. Decision:**  \nDOWN puts me 1 step from apple (3,6), which is the closest apple. It also keeps good mobility.  \nEnemy is far away, so likely I can eat it next turn safely.  \nEating apples faster is key to catching up (enemy has 12 apples, I have 11).  \n\nAlso, board shows my body encloses some area but DOWN moves me into more open space bottom-left.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go DOWN now to (2,6), next turn I can go RIGHT to (3,6) to eat apple unless enemy suddenly appears nearby (unlikely). Then after eating, I\u2019ll have to check mobility with longer body.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN",

Cell (9, 6) is currently empty.\n*   **DOWN to (9, 4):** Into my body segment: (9, 4). KILLS ME (Moving directly backwards).\n*   **LEFT to (8, 5):** Safe. Opens the path towards the center.\n*   **RIGHT to (10, 5):** Off board. KILLS ME.\n\nSafe Moves: UP, LEFT.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves:**\n\n**A. Move UP to (9, 6):**\n*   Leads directly toward A5 (9, 7) (1 step away from the apple after this move).\n*   (9, 6) is currently empty.\n*   This keeps me safe along the edge.\n\n**B. Move LEFT to (8, 5):**\n*   Moves away from A5 (9, 7) (MD increases from 2 to |8-9| + |7-5| = 3).\n*   Opens up the center of the board.\n*   The path is clear.\n\nGiven the close proximity of A5 (9, 7), maximizing score superiority dictates aiming for the immediate apple target unless safety is compromised. Moving UP secures the favorable position to grab A5 next turn.\n\n**4. Collision Check (Enemy Snake #0 Head at (2, 6))**\n\nS0 is far from my target area. S0's possible moves:\n*   UP (2, 7) - Body segment. KILLS S0.\n*   DOWN (2, 5) - Safe.\n*   LEFT (1, 6) - Safe.\n*   RIGHT (3, 6) - Apple A4. EATS APPLE. BEST MOVE FOR S0.\n\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (3, 6), the distance between heads decreases slightly but is still very large. No risk of collision on the right wall.\n\n**5. Final Decision:**\nMove UP to (9, 6) to position for eating A5 (9, 7) next turn.\n\n**Strategy Note for Future Turn:**\nIf I move UP to (9, 6), next turn I will move UP to (9, 7) to claim A5. After that, I will be at (9, 7). The next closest apple will be A1 (8, 9) (MD 3 distance, move LEFT, then UP twice). Or possibly A4 (3, 6) (MD 6 distance). I should plan to move LEFT after eating A5 to avoid getting boxed into the corner.\n\nUP",

Length: 13 (Apples: 12).\n    *   S0's last tail segment (5, 5) remains if it didn't eat.

Apples and Distances (Manhattan Distance from (9, 7)):**\n*   A5 (8, 7): |8-9| + |7-7| = 1 (Immediate target!)\n*   A1 (8, 9): |8-9| + |9-7| = 1 + 2 = 3\n*   A4 (8, 1): |8-9| + |1-7| = 1 + 6 = 7\n*   A2 (0, 8): |0-9| + |8-7| = 9 + 1 = 10\n*   A3 (1, 0): |1-9| + |0-7| = 8 + 7 = 15\n\nThe apple A5 (8, 7) is one move LEFT.\n\n**2.

Oops, my body is (9, 6). S0's body is [(3, 6), (2, 6), ...]. S0 moving to (3, 6) hits its own previously occupied cell. This is an S0 body segment. KILLS S0.\n*   DOWN (3, 4): Safe.\n*   LEFT (2, 5): Safe.\n*   RIGHT (4, 5): Safe.\n\nS0 will likely move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. None of these moves interfere with my move LEFT to (8, 7).\n\n**5. Long-Term Plan (T=52 onwards):**\nIf I move LEFT to (8, 7) and eat the apple:\nHead will be at (8, 7). Length 16.

          "rationale": "Let\u2019s analyze the current state.  \n\n**My snake (ID 0):**  \nHead at (3, 5). Body: [(3,6), (2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5)].  \nSo neck is at (3,6). I cannot move into my own body or off-board.  \n\n**Possible moves from (3,5):**  \n\n- UP: (3,6) \u2192 occupied by my body (neck) \u2192 **invalid**.  \n- DOWN: (3,4) \u2192 currently empty on board, safe? Need to check enemy body positions.  \n- LEFT: (2,5) \u2192 empty on board, safe? Check enemy body.  \n- RIGHT: (4,5) \u2192 occupied by my body at (4,5)? Wait, looking at my body list: (5,5) is my tail, (4,5) not listed. Board shows at (4,5) a dot, so it\u2019s empty. But check enemy body: enemy snake #1 has body at \u2026 scanning: no enemy at (4,5). So safe? Need to check head collision risk.  \n\n**Check enemy snake #1:** Head at (9,7), body long along row 3 etc. No enemy body at my candidate moves (3,4), (2,5), (4,5).  \n\n**Check immediate danger:** Enemy head at (9,7) can move this turn. Its possible moves from (9,7): UP (9,8) empty? Board shows (9,8) is dot, safe for them. DOWN (9,6) is their own neck. LEFT (8,7) is empty? Board shows (8,7) is apple \u2018A\u2019. RIGHT off-board. So enemy likely moves LEFT to eat apple at (8,7) or UP to (9,8). They might also move DOWN into their neck? That\u2019s illegal. So they have UP and LEFT safe.  \n\nIf they move LEFT to (8,7), they eat apple there and grow. That doesn\u2019t threaten me directly now.  \n\n**Head-on collision risk:** My possible moves vs enemy possible moves:  \nEnemy possible heads next turn: (9,8), (8,7). My possible heads next turn: (3,4), (2,5), (4,5). No overlap \u2192 no head-on collision this turn.  \n\nSo all 3 moves DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT appear safe immediately.  \n\n**Future options:**  \nFrom (3,4): possible next moves: UP back to (3,5) (occupied then by my body? Actually my body will shift forward, so (3,5) will be occupied next turn by my neck), LEFT (2,4), RIGHT (4,4), DOWN (3,3).  \nFrom (2,5): next moves: UP (2,6) my body? After move, my body shifts, (2,6) will be my neck? Actually after moving head to (2,5), my neck becomes old head (3,5) \u2192 (2,6) is part of body yes. So UP blocked. DOWN (2,4), LEFT (1,5), RIGHT (3,5) neck.  \nFrom (4,5): next moves: UP (4,6) my body? After move, (4,6) is body? Actually body list: (5,6) is body, (4,6) empty currently, but after move my body shifts, (4,6) becomes my neck? Wait: head moves to (4,5), neck is old head (3,5), so (4,6) is free initially but will be occupied by my neck next turn? No: my body is [(4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (2,6), ...], so (4,6) free. Actually (4,6) is free now, and next turn it\u2019s not neck because neck is (3,5). So UP to (4,6) is safe next turn? But (4,6) is currently empty.  \n\nBut check board: at (4,6) there\u2019s \u2018T\u2019 (tail of enemy? No, that\u2019s my snake? Actually my snake body at (4,6)? No my body list doesn\u2019t have (4,6). But board shows (4,6) as \u2018T\u2019? Wait looking at board row 6: \"6 . . T T . T . . . T\" \u2192 so col 4 row 6 is \u2018T\u2019, meaning my body? But my body list shows (4,6) not there. Hmm maybe board coordinates: row 6 col 4 = x=4,y=6? Yes that\u2019s (4,6). It\u2019s marked \u2018T\u2019 but maybe that\u2019s enemy? Actually enemy body at (4,6)? No enemy body list: ends at (1,3), so not. So maybe board is wrong or I misread. Let\u2019s check carefully:  \nBoard row 6: \"6 . . T T . T . . . T\" \u2192  \nCoordinates: x=0..9, row 6 means y=6. So at x=3,y=6: T, x=4,y=6: T, x=5,y=6: ., x=6,y=6: T, etc.  \nMy body: at (3,6) yes, at (4,6)? No. At (5,6) yes. So why x=4,y=6 is T? Possibly enemy? But enemy not there. Could be my body from earlier? But current body list no. Might be display glitch but assume board correct: means (4,6) occupied by some snake\u2019s body part (maybe mine from earlier turn but not in current list \u2014 impossible). Let\u2019s trust current body list: (4,6) free.  \n\nAnyway, safest move long-term: I want apples: apples at (8,9), (0,8), (1,0), (8,1), (8,7).  \nClosest to me: (8,7) is close to enemy head, risky. (1,0) far but safe. (0,8) far.  \nMy snake is long (length 13). Need space to maneuver without trapping self.  \n\nLEFT to (2,5) seems okay, heads toward left side apples. DOWN to (3,4) heads toward row 3 which is full of enemy body (enemy body along y=3 across board). That\u2019s dangerous because next turn from (3,4), DOWN to (3,3) hits enemy body. So DOWN risky for future.  \n\nRIGHT to (4,5) heads toward right side where enemy is.  \n\nLEFT seems best: opens path to lower left where apples (1,0) and open space.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move LEFT toward (0,8) or (1,0) eventually, avoid row 3 enemy body, keep distance from enemy head. From (2,5), next move could be DOWN to (2,4) then LEFT to (1,4) etc.  \n\nLEFT",

Conclusion:**\nMoving UP to (8, 8) is safe and directly progresses towards the closest apple (8, 9).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T=53 onwards):**\nIf I move UP to (8, 8). Next turn, I move UP again to (8, 9) to eat A1. This will put my head at the top edge of the board.

UP (1, 6): Safe.\n    2.  DOWN (1, 4): Safe.\n    3.  LEFT (0, 5): Safe.\n    4.  RIGHT (2, 5): Into S0 body. KILLS S0. IMPOSSIBLE.\n\nS0 cannot interfere with my movement to (8, 9). Head-on collision is impossible as the closest S0 can be to (8, 9) in one move is still very far away (minimum distance D((1, 5), (8, 9)) = 7 + 4 = 11. 1 move can close max 2 distance, still leaves 9 distance).\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nMoving UP to (8, 9) is guaranteed to be safe and maximizes my score.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T=54 onwards):**\nAfter eating the apple at (8, 9), my head will be at (8, 9). I will have maximized my length on the top edge. The next closest apples are A4 (8, 1) and A2 (0, 8).\nSince I am already at x=8, going down towards A4 (8, 1) seems logical unless S0 blocks my way.\nIf I move DOWN (8, 8) then DOWN (8, 7)... I need to check the space between the body segments at (9, 7) and (8, 7).\nAlternative: Move LEFT towards A2 (0, 8). (8, 9) -> (7, 9) -> ...\nThe vertical path down the 8-column seems clear and efficient: (8, 9) -> (8, 8) -> (8, 7) -> ... -> (8, 1). I will evaluate if S0 poses a threat to this path next turn.\n\nMy move is UP.\nUP",

Eliminate immediately deadly moves\n\n- **UP (1, 6)**:  \n  - (1, 6) is currently empty on board (`.` at 6,1 in board display? Wait, careful: board is y-axis from bottom=0 to top=9, x from left=0 to right=9.)  \n  - Board at y=6, x=1 is '.' according to diagram:  \n    Row y=6: `. . T T . . . . . T` \u2192 so (1,6) is `.` (empty).  \n  - Is (1,6) in any snake body? My body: check list: my body coordinates:  \n    (2,5),(3,5),(3,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7),(4,8),(4,9),(5,9),(5,8),(5,7) \u2192 no (1,6).  \n  - Enemy body: Snake #1 body:  \n    (8,7),(9,7),(9,6),(9,5),(9,4),(9,3),(8,3),(8,2),(7,2),(7,3),(6,3),(5,3),(4,3),(3,3),(2,3) \u2192 no (1,6).  \n  - So UP is safe from collision.\n\n- **DOWN (1, 4)**:  \n  - (1,4) is '.' from board (y=4 row `. . . . . . . . . T` \u2192 (1,4) = `.`).  \n  - Not in my body list. Not in enemy body list.  \n  - So DOWN is safe.\n\n- **LEFT (0, 5)**:  \n  - (0,5) is '.' from board (y=5 row `. 0 T T . . . . . T` \u2192 (0,5) = `.`).  \n  - Not in my body list. Not in enemy body list.  \n  - So LEFT is safe.\n\n- **RIGHT (2, 5)**:  \n  - (2,5) is in my body list (second segment). That would kill me.  \n  - So RIGHT is unsafe.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Consider enemy head movement possibilities\n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (8,8). Possible moves for enemy:  \n- UP (8,9) \u2192 apple there, but also possible collision with me? I'm far away.  \n- DOWN (8,7) \u2192 that's its own body segment (8,7) is in its body list \u2192 so unsafe for enemy.  \n- LEFT (7,8) \u2192 empty on board (y=8 row `A . . . T T . . 1 .` \u2192 (7,8) = `.`).  \n- RIGHT (9,8) \u2192 empty on board (9,8) = `.`.\n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is suicide so enemy likely won\u2019t choose it.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Which moves get me closer to apples?\n\nApples: (8,9), (0,8), (1,0), (8,1), (0,7).\n\nFrom my head (1,5):\n\n- Apple (0,8): dist = |1-0|+|5-8|=1+3=4  \n- Apple (0,7): dist = 1+2=3  \n- Apple (1,0): dist = 0+5=5  \n- Apple (8,1): dist = 7+4=11  \n- Apple (8,9): dist = 7+4=11\n\nClosest apples: (0,7) dist 3, (0,8) dist 4.\n\n(0,7) is at y=7, x=0.  \n(0,8) is at y=8, x=0.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Evaluate my safe moves for progress toward nearest apples:\n\n- **UP (1,6)**: dist to (0,7): |1-0|+|6-7|=1+1=2 (closer)  \n  dist to (0,8): |1-0|+|6-8|=1+2=3 (closer than original 4)\n\n- **DOWN (1,4)**: dist to (0,7): 1+3=4 (worse)  \n  dist to (0,8): 1+4=5 (worse)\n\n- **LEFT (0,5)**: dist to (0,7): 0+2=2 (closer)  \n  dist to (0,8): 0+3=3 (closer)\n\nSo UP and LEFT both get me closer to nearest apples.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Future options after each safe move:\n\n**UP to (1,6)**:  \nFrom (1,6), possible next moves:  \nUP (1,7), DOWN (1,5), LEFT (0,6), RIGHT (2,6).  \n- (1,7): is that free? Board (1,7): y=7 row `A . T T T T . . T T` \u2192 x=1,y=7 is `.`? Wait check: y=7 row: `A . T T T T . . T T` \u2192 positions: x=0=A, x=1=., x=2=T, x=3=T, x=4=T, x=5=T, x=6=., x=7=., x=8=T, x=9=T. So (1,7) is `.`.  \n- (1,5): my old head position, but after moving, my body segment (2,5) will move into (1,5) only if I move UP? Actually body movement: head moves to (1,6), body shifts: old (1,5) becomes new neck, so (1,5) will be occupied by my body next turn. So DOWN next turn would be suicide. So from (1,6), DOWN is unsafe next turn.  \n- (0,6): empty (board y=6: `. . T T . . . . . T` \u2192 (0,6)=`.`)  \n- (2,6): occupied by my body currently (2,6) is in my body list, but will it be there next turn? Let\u2019s simulate: my body: head (1,5)\u2192(1,6), then (2,5)\u2192(1,5), (3,5)\u2192(2,5), (3,6)\u2192(3,5), (2,6)\u2192(3,6), (2,7)\u2192(2,6), (3,7)\u2192(2,7), (4,7)\u2192(3,7), (4,8)\u2192(4,7), (4,9)\u2192(4,8), (5,9)\u2192(4,9), (5,8)\u2192(5,9), (5,7)\u2192(5,8). Tail (5,7) disappears if no apple eaten. So next turn body: (1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(3,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7),(4,8),(4,9),(5,9),(5,8).  \nSo (2,6) is occupied next turn. So RIGHT from (1,6) is unsafe.  \nThus from (1,6), only UP and LEFT are safe next turn. That\u2019s 2 options.\n\n---\n\n**LEFT to (0,5)**:  \nFrom (0,5), next moves:  \nUP (0,6), DOWN (0,4), LEFT invalid (-1,5), RIGHT (1,5).  \n- (0,6): empty.  \n- (0,4): empty.  \n- (1,5): occupied by my body next turn (neck).  \nSo from (0,5), safe next moves: UP, DOWN (2 options).\n\n---\n\n**DOWN to (1,4)**:  \nFrom (1,4), next moves:  \nUP (1,5) \u2192 occupied (neck), DOWN (1,3), LEFT (0,4), RIGHT (2,4).  \n- (1,3): board y=3 row `. . T T T T T T T T` \u2192 (1,3)=`.`? Actually x=1,y=3 = `.`.  \n- (0,4): empty.  \n- (2,4): empty (board y=4 row `. . . . . . . . . T` \u2192 (2,4)=`.`).  \nSo safe next moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options). But moving DOWN takes me away from nearest apples.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Risk of head-on collision this turn\n\nEnemy head (8,8) could move UP to (8,9) (apple), LEFT to (7,8), RIGHT to (9,8). None intersect my possible moves (1,6), (1,4), (0,5). So no direct head-on collision possible this turn.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Choose best move\n\nUP gets me closer to apples (0,7),(0,8) but leaves only 2 safe moves next turn.  \nLEFT gets me closer too and leaves 2 safe moves next turn as well (but moving to board edge x=0 limits LEFT next turn). Actually from (0,5), only UP/DOWN safe, no LEFT (off board), no RIGHT (into neck). So also 2 options.  \n\nDOWN gives more options next turn (3) but moves away from apples.\n\nGiven my score is behind (12 vs 15), I should prioritize apple collection.  \nBetween UP and LEFT:  \nUP: next at (1,6), then can go UP to (1,7) closer to (0,8)/(0,7), or LEFT to (0,6).  \nLEFT: next at (0,5), then can go UP to (0,6) or DOWN to (0,4).\n\nUP seems better because (1,7) is closer to apple (0,7) than (0,5) is? Let\u2019s check: from (1,7) to (0,7): dist 1. From (0,5) to (0,7): dist 2. So UP then UP gets very close.\n\nAlso, apple at (0,7) is just above (0,6), so from (1,6) going LEFT then UP could get it.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nMove toward (0,7) via UP then LEFT then UP, or UP then UP then LEFT. Avoid trapping self. Keep an eye on enemy path \u2014 they are on other side of board currently.\n\n---\n\nUP",

Apples and Distances (Manhattan Distance from H1 (8, 9)):**\n*   A5 (8, 5): |8-8| + |5-9| = 4 (DOWN)\n*   A3 (8, 1): |8-8| + |1-9| = 8 (DOWN)\n*   A1 (0, 8): |0-8| + |8-9| = 8 + 1 = 9\n*   A4 (0, 7): |0-8| + |7-9| = 8 + 2 = 10\n*   A2 (1, 0): |1-8| + |0-9| = 7 + 9 = 16\n\nThe apples A5 (8, 5) and A3 (8, 1) are on the vertical path down the x=8 column, which seems open. A5 is the closest.\n\n**2. Candidate Moves from H1 (8, 9):**\n\n*   **UP to (8, 10):** Off board. KILLS ME. IMPOSSIBLE.\n*   **DOWN to (8, 8):** Into my body segment: (8, 8). KILLS ME (Backwards move). IMPOSSIBLE.\n*   **LEFT to (7, 9):** Safe. Moves away from the vertical path to the closest apple (A5).\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 9):** Safe. Keeps me on the top edge.\n\nSince I cannot move directly backwards (DOWN to (8, 8)), I must choose a move that repositions my head to a safe location while aiming towards A5 (8, 5) or A3 (8, 1).\n\nThe current position (8, 9) is tightly against the enemy body sections (4, 9), (5, 9) to the left, and the edge to the right.\n\n*   If I move **LEFT (7, 9)**: I start moving along the top wall. This is a path towards A1 (0, 8) and A4 (0, 7), but involves traversing enemy body segments starting at (5, 9) onwards. The segment at (5, 9) is the S0 body segment which will likely move/vanish next turn since S0's tail is currently (5, 8) and S0's head is (1, 6).\n    New position (7, 9). Safe.\n*   If I move **RIGHT (9, 9)**: This is the safest way to get off the wall and potentially setup for a trip down the x=9 column, then across x=8/7.\n    New position (9, 9). Safe.\n\nLet's look at the optimal path towards A5 (8, 5).\nH1 (8, 9) -> Must move (7, 9) or (9, 9).\n\nIf (9, 9):\n(9, 9) -> (9, 8) -> (9, 7). Ah, (9, 7) is my own body segment. (My body is [(8, 8), (8, 7), (9, 7)...]). So moving down the 9 column is restrictive.\n\nIf (7, 9):\n(7, 9) -> (7, 8) -> (7, 7) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 5) -> (8, 5) [A5]. This seems like a reasonable route, but it's 5 moves long and requires moving past potential enemy territory (though S0 is currently low left).\n\nLet's re-examine the map constraints around the head:\n(8, 9) is the head.\n(8, 8) is the neck (backwards death).\n(9, 9) is open.\n(7, 9) is open.\n(6, 9) is S0's body (4, 9), (5, 9). No, (4, 9) and (5, 9) are S0's body, but (6, 9) and (7, 9) are free space.\n\nIf I move **LEFT (7, 9)**:\n*   Next turn T=55, H1 at (7, 9).\n*   Options: DOWN (7, 8) - Safe. LEFT (6, 9) - Safe. RIGHT (8, 9) - Safe (now that (8, 8) is my neck).\n*   This setup allows me to navigate towards the center of the board or head down towards A5.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT (9, 9)**:\n*   Next turn T=55, H1 at (9, 9).\n*   Options: DOWN (9, 8) - Safe. LEFT (8, 9) - Safe.\n*   The path down the 9-column is immediately blocked by my body segment (9, 7). I would have to zig-zag back into column 8 or 7 eventually. (9, 9) -> (9, 8) -> (8, 8) or (8, 7). (8, 8) is currently my neck, but after moving RIGHT, (8, 9) becomes the neck. So (8, 8) is safe. (9, 8) -> (8, 8) -> (8, 7). This path also works, but feels slightly longer than the LEFT path to get towards A5.\n\nI prefer **LEFT** to (7, 9). This opens up the route down the x=7 column, which is mostly free of my body segments until (7, 3) and (7, 2). This column provides a good funnel towards A5 (8, 5).\n\n**3. Enemy Snake #0 Threat (H0 at (1, 6)):**\nS0 is heading UP or staying low.\nPossible moves for S0 from (1, 6):\n1. UP (1, 7): Safe. Moves towards top left apples (A1, A4).\n2. DOWN (1, 5): Into S0 body. KILLS S0. IMPOSSIBLE.\n3. LEFT (0, 6): Safe.\n4. RIGHT (2, 6): Into S0 body. KILLS S0. IMPOSSIBLE.\n\nS0 is currently not a threat to my chosen path (7, 9). S0 is likely moving towards (1, 7) or (0, 6) to scope out A1/A4.\n\n**4. Move Selection:**\nLEFT (7, 9) is safe, opens up the board, and positions me well for the movement sequence necessary to reach A5 (8, 5) without colliding with myself immediately.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T=55 onwards):**\nH1 at (7, 9). Target A5 (8, 5).\nT55: (7, 9) -> DOWN (7, 8)\nT56: (7, 8) -> DOWN (7, 7)\nT57: (7, 7) -> DOWN (7, 6)\nT58: (7, 6) -> DOWN (7, 5)\nT59: (7, 5) -> RIGHT (8, 5) [Eats A5].\n\nThis path looks clear, assuming S0 remains in the lower left quadrant.\n\nLEFT",

Actually: current body: (1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(3,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7),(4,8),(4,9),(5,9),(5,8).

Moves towards A5.\n*   **LEFT to (6, 9):** Safe. Moves along the top edge, away from A5.\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 9):** Into my body segment: (8, 9). KILLS ME (Backwards move).\n\n**3. Move Evaluation:**\n\n*   **DOWN (7, 8):** This is the direct, intended move to start traversing the path towards A5 (8, 5). The path looks clear: (7, 8) -> (7, 7) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 5) -> (8, 5) or similar deviation if needed.\n    *   Safety check: (7, 8) is clear space.\n*   **LEFT (6, 9):** Safe, but deviates from the primary target A5. It keeps me on the top edge, potentially preparing for A1/A4, but those are further away and closer to the enemy snake.\n\n**4. Enemy Snake Threat (H0 at (1, 7)):**\nS0 is close to A4 (0, 7) and A1 (0, 8). S0 previously moved from (1, 6) to (1, 7).\nPossible moves for S0 from (1, 7):\n1. UP (1, 8): Safe. Close to A1 (0, 8).\n2. DOWN (1, 6): Into S0 body. KILLS S0. IMPOSSIBLE.\n3. LEFT (0, 7): *Potentially eats A4.*\n4. RIGHT (2, 7): Safe.\n\nS0 is likely trying to secure A4 (0, 7) or A1 (0, 8). H0 is far away from H1 (7, 9), so there is no immediate threat of collision, and S0's movement is not restricting my path to A5.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nThe move DOWN to (7, 8) is safe and directly aligns with the strategy to acquire A5 (8, 5).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T=56 onwards):**\nH1 at (7, 8). Target A5 (8, 5).\nT56: (7, 8) -> DOWN (7, 7)\nT57: (7, 7) -> DOWN (7, 6)\nT58: (7, 6) -> DOWN (7, 5)\nT59: (7, 5) -> RIGHT (8, 5) [Eats A5].\n\nDOWN",

Unsafe.  \n- **LEFT (0, 7)** \u2192 Apple at (0, 7), safe unless enemy head moves there now. Not in my body. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT (2, 7)** \u2192 Occupied by my body (segment (2, 7)). Unsafe.  \n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**2. Apples positions:**  \nApples: (0, 8), (1, 0), (8, 1), (0, 7), (8, 5)  \n\nFrom (1, 7):  \n- (0, 7): distance 1 (left) \u2014 apple  \n- (0, 8): distance 2 (left + up)  \n- Others far away.  \n\nLEFT goes directly to apple (0, 7).  \n\n---\n\n**3. Enemy snake #1 head at (7, 9)**  \nEnemy possible moves from (7, 9):  \nUP (7, 10) off board \u2192 unsafe  \nDOWN (7, 8) \u2192 board '.' at (7, 8) but check enemy body: enemy body: [(8, 9), (8, 8), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3)] \u2014 (7, 8) not in enemy body, so DOWN safe for enemy.  \nLEFT (6, 9) \u2192 '.' safe  \nRIGHT (8, 9) \u2192 occupied by enemy body segment (8, 9) \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo enemy safe moves: DOWN, LEFT.  \n\nCould enemy reach (0, 7) in one move? No, too far. Could enemy head move into (0, 7) next turn if I go LEFT now? Enemy at (7, 9) \u2192 (0, 7) distance 15, impossible in 1 turn. So no direct head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Next turn safety after each safe move**  \n\n**LEFT to (0, 7) apple**:  \nAfter eating apple, snake grows by 1, new body: head at (0, 7), then old head (1, 7) becomes new neck, then rest of body shifts. So next turn body: (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9), tail (5, 8) disappears? Wait length check: current length = 13 segments (head + 12 body). Apple adds 1, so new length = 14. So tail stays same position? Actually tail disappears only if no apple eaten. Since apple eaten, tail does NOT disappear, length increases by 1. So tail stays at (5, 9)? Let\u2019s track:  \nCurrent: head (1, 7), body: (1,6),(1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(3,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7),(4,8),(4,9),(5,9).  \nAfter LEFT to apple (0,7): new head (0,7), old head (1,7) becomes segment 2, then each body segment shifts forward, tail (5,9) stays because length increases. So new body: (0,7),(1,7),(1,6),(1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(3,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7),(4,8),(4,9),(5,9).  \n\nNext moves from (0, 7):  \nUP (0, 8) apple, DOWN (0, 6), LEFT invalid, RIGHT (1, 7) occupied (neck).  \nDOWN (0, 6) currently '.' and not in body next turn (body has (0,7),(1,7),(1,6)... so (0,6) free).  \nUP (0, 8) apple, free.  \nSo from (0, 7) next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN (2 options).  \n\n**UP to (1, 8)**:  \nNo apple eaten. Body shifts: head (1, 8), neck (1, 7), then rest, tail disappears. So length stays 13. New body: (1,8),(1,7),(1,6),(1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(3,6),(2,6),(2,7),(3,7),(4,7),(4,8),(4,9),(5,9) missing tail (5,8) gone. Wait length 13 means tail gone: old body last was (5,9), so tail (5,9) gone, new last segment becomes (4,9).  \n\nNext moves from (1, 8):  \nUP (1, 9) '.'  \nDOWN (1, 7) occupied (neck)  \nLEFT (0, 8) apple '.'  \nRIGHT (2, 8) '.'  \n\nSo safe next moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n---\n\n**5. Comparison**  \n\nUP (1, 8): safe now, 3 safe next moves, no apple this turn.  \nLEFT (0, 7): apple now, 2 safe next moves after eating.  \n\nApple at (0, 7) is low-risk to take now. Eating it brings me to 13 apples vs enemy 16, still behind but closer. After eating, I\u2019ll be at (0, 7) with options UP to (0, 8) apple or DOWN to (0, 6). Could be tight against left wall but manageable short-term.  \n\nUP gives more future flexibility but delays apple. Since enemy is far, taking apple now seems safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turns:**  \nAfter eating (0, 7), go UP to (0, 8) apple if safe, then consider moving right across top or down left side to avoid trapping myself. Enemy is on right side, avoid moving toward them until necessary. Keep tracking enemy head moves to avoid head collisions.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

This means Snake 0 moved LEFT from (1, 7) onto the apple at (0, 7). It successfully ate that apple.\n    *   Body: [(1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9)].\n*   New Apples: A1 (0, 8), A2 (1, 0), A3 (8, 1), A4 (8, 5), A5 (2, 1). (Note: (0, 7) was consumed by S0, a new apple appeared at (2, 1)).\n\n**Board Snapshot (T=56):**\n 9 . . . . T T . T T .\n 8 A . . . T . . 1 T . (A1 at (0, 8), H1 at (7, 8))\n 7 0 T T T T . . .

Apples and Distances (Manhattan Distance from H1 (7, 8)):**\n*   A4 (8, 5): |8-7| + |5-8| = 1 + 3 = 4 (Target)\n*   A1 (0, 8): |0-7| + |8-8| = 7 + 0 = 7.

Candidate Moves from H1 (7, 8):**\n\n*   **UP to (7, 9):** Into my body segment: (7, 9). KILLS ME (Backwards move).\n*   **DOWN to (7, 7):** Safe. Directly moves towards A4 (8, 5).\n*   **LEFT to (6, 8):** Safe. Moves away from A4.\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 8):** Into my body segment: (8, 8). KILLS ME.\n\n**3. Move Evaluation:**\n\n*   **DOWN (7, 7):** This is the only safe move that progresses towards A4 (8, 5). Following this path:\n    *   T56: H1 (7, 8) -> (7, 7) [DOWN]\n    *   T57: (7, 7) -> (7, 6) [DOWN]\n    *   T58: (7, 6) -> (7, 5) [DOWN]\n    *   T59: (7, 5) -> (8, 5) [RIGHT, Eats A4]\n\n*   **LEFT (6, 8):** Safe, but deviates. I would then need to move LEFT or DOWN significantly to find another apple, increasing the travel distance.\n\n**4. Enemy Snake Threat (H0 at (0, 7)):**\nS0 is at (0, 7). It just ate an apple. It is unlikely to move right across the middle of the board to interfere with my path to (8, 5). S0 is likely targeting A1 (0, 8) or perhaps A2 (1, 0) or A5 (2, 1).\nPossible moves for S0 from (0, 7):\n1. UP (0, 8): Eats A1. HIGHLY LIKELY.\n2. DOWN (0, 6): Safe.\n3. LEFT (-1, 7): Off board. KILLS S0.\n4. RIGHT (1, 7): Into S0 body. KILLS S0.\n\nS0 will almost certainly move UP to (0, 8) and eat A1. This doesn't affect my plan.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\nThe move DOWN to (7, 7) is the necessary and safe step to continue the path towards the critical apple at (8, 5).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T=57 onwards):**\nH1 at (7, 7). Target A4 (8, 5).\nT57: (7, 7) -> DOWN (7, 6)\nT58: (7, 6) -> DOWN (7, 5)\nT59: (7, 5) -> RIGHT (8, 5) [Eats A4].\nThen evaluate new targets.\n\nDOWN",

Not in my body. Safe.  \n- **LEFT**: off board \u2192 deadly.  \n- **RIGHT (1, 7)**: Occupied by my neck segment (1, 7) \u2192 deadly.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**2.

Comparison**  \n\nUP: gets apple, 2 safe next moves, but after eating at (0, 8) I\u2019m in top-left corner with only UP and RIGHT available next turn. RIGHT leads to (1, 8) which might be okay.  \n\nDOWN: no apple, only 1 safe next move (DOWN again), which leads to (0, 5) and then possibly trapped along left wall with limited exits.  \n\nUP is clearly better \u2014 gets apple and more options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter UP to (0, 8), consider RIGHT to (1, 8) to avoid trapping in corner, then possibly up to (1, 9) or right to (2, 8) depending on board and enemy positions. Enemy is far right, so moving right gradually toward center may be safe. Avoid moving toward enemy head unless necessary.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

This spot is strategically central and keeps my X position clear of the bulk of my body on the right edge.\n*   If I choose **RIGHT (8, 7)**: I prioritize A3 (8, 5). This moves me close to the complex body structures along the 8th and 9th column. (8, 7) is currently clear.\n\nThe planned move from the last turn was DOWN to (7, 7). Continuing that trajectory feels natural and leads directly toward the new, slightly easier target (7, 4). Moving DOWN (7, 6) also keeps the option for A3 (8, 5) open via a future RIGHT move to (8, 6) if A5 (7, 4) suddenly becomes unreachable or less favorable.\n\n**4. Enemy Snake Threat (H0 at (0, 8)):**\nS0 is at (0, 8). It just ate an apple. Its likely next target is A4 (2, 1) or A1 (1, 0).\nPossible moves for S0 from (0, 8):\n1. UP (0, 9): Safe, but corner.\n2. DOWN (0, 7): Into its body. KILLS S0.\n3. LEFT (-1, 8): Off board. KILLS S0.\n4. RIGHT (1, 8): Safe. Can move towards A4 (2, 1) or A1 (1, 0).\n\nS0 will likely move (1, 8) or (0, 9). S0 poses no immediate threat to H1's path towards (7, 6).\n\n**5. Connectivity Check (Flood Fill/Escape Route):**\nMy snake is primarily using the right side columns (7, 8, 9). Moving DOWN to (7, 6) keeps me in the open region of the board.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving DOWN towards (7, 6) is safe, maintains momentum from the previous turn, and targets the nearby apple A5 (7, 4), which is distance 3 away.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T=58 onwards):**\nH1 at (7, 6). Target A5 (7, 4).\nT58: (7, 6) -> DOWN (7, 5)\nT59: (7, 5) -> DOWN (7, 4) [Eats A5].\nThen evaluate new targets.\n\nDOWN",

Let's examine the cells required:\n\n*   (7, 5) and (7, 4) are currently empty.\n*   (8, 6) is currently empty. (8, 5) is A3.\n\nBoth are very safe in terms of immediate self-collision or border collision.\n\n**Enemy Snake Threat (H0 at (1, 8)):**\nS0 is at (1, 8). Its body is at (0, 8).\nLikely targets for S0 are A4 (2, 1) or A1 (1, 0).\nS0 candidate moves:\n1. UP (1, 9): Safe.\n2. DOWN (1, 7): Safe.\n3. LEFT (0, 8): Into its body. KILLS S0.\n4. RIGHT (2, 8): Safe.\n\nS0 is extremely far from my targets and poses no threat to my movements (7, 5) or (8, 6).\n\n**Comparing DOWN (7, 5) vs. RIGHT (8, 6):**\n\n1.  **DOWN (7, 5):** This continues my movement down the central column. The area around (7, 4) is relatively open, and collecting this apple puts my body into the lower-middle part of the board, potentially opening up the X=8/9 columns which contain much of my existing long body (tail starts at (6, 3)).\n2.  **RIGHT (8, 6):** This moves me into column 8. This is closer to the dense body mass in columns 8/9. Although (8, 6) is clear, it places me slightly more constrained near (8, 7) and (9, 6) body segments.\n\nI will prioritize the move that keeps me slightly more central and utilizes the path that was planned when I moved down last turn, which was implicitly to clear the area around the center. Moving `DOWN` to (7, 5) secures A5 (7, 4) and maintains better board coverage.\n\nLet's double-check any possibility of a head-on collision at T=59. S0 cannot reach (7, 4) or (8, 5) in two moves.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving DOWN to (7, 5) is safe and leads directly to the nearest apple, A5 (7, 4).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T=59 onwards):**\nH1 at (7, 5). Target A5 (7, 4).\nT59: (7, 5) -> DOWN (7, 4) [Eats A5].\nThen evaluate new targets. Priority shifts to A3 (8, 5) or A2 (8, 1).\n\nDOWN",

Apples and Distances (Manhattan Distance from H1 (7, 5)):**\nMy target last turn was A5 (7, 4) and A3 (8, 5), distance 2. I moved to (7, 5).\n\n*   A5 (7, 4): |7-7| + |4-5| = 1.

Candidate Moves from H1 (7, 5):**\n\n*   **UP to (7, 6):** Into my body segment. KILLS ME (Backwards move).\n*   **DOWN to (7, 4):** A5 (Apple). Eats apple. Safe.\n*   **LEFT to (6, 5):** Safe (Board Cell is '.').\n*   **RIGHT to (8, 5):** A3 (Apple). Eats apple. Safe.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT lead to eating an apple and are immediately safe. I need to decide which apple is strategically better.\n\n**3. Move Evaluation - Apple Selection:**\n\n*   **Option 1: DOWN to (7, 4) [Eats A5].**\n    *   Resulting H1 position: (7, 4).\n    *   Apple count increases, length increases.\n    *   This puts me closer to A4 (2, 1) and A2 (8, 1) in terms of y-coordinate, but far from A4 in x. It keeps me in the relatively clear column 7.\n\n*   **Option 2: RIGHT to (8, 5) [Eats A3].**\n    *   Resulting H1 position: (8, 5).\n    *   Apple count increases, length increases.\n    *   This puts me adjacent to my main body mass in columns 8 and 9. Cell (8, 6) is currently empty. Cell (9, 5) is my body. Cell (8, 4) is empty. (8, 5) seems a slightly tighter spot as it is bordered by my tail segments (9, 5) and (8, 7). However, (8, 4) is open.\n\n**4. Enemy Snake #0 Threat (H0 at (2, 8)):**\nH0 is at (2, 8). Its movement priority is likely to continue downward or move toward A4 (2, 1).\nPossible moves for H0: (1, 8) [Backward, Kill], (3, 8) [Right, Safe], (2, 9) [Up, Safe], (2, 7) [Down, Safe].\n\nS0 is far away from both (7, 4) and (8, 5). No head-on collision threat.\n\n**5. Strategic Comparison:**\n\nSince both moves are safe and yield an apple immediately, I choose based on future opportunities and board congestion.\n\n*   Moving to (7, 4) keeps me central. From (7, 4), the next closest apple is A2 (8, 1) (Manhattan distance 4: 1 right, 3 down) or A4 (2, 1) (Manhattan distance 5: 5 left, 3 down).\n*   Moving to (8, 5) puts me in column 8. From (8, 5), the next closest apple is A2 (8, 1) (Manhattan distance 4: 4 down).\n\n(7, 4) gives slightly better access to the lower left area (where A4 is located) if I decide to go that way, or allows a more structured traversal path down column 7 towards (7, 3), (7, 2), etc., which are currently body segments but which could soon open up as the tail moves.\n\nThe area around (8, 5) is heavily surrounded by my body (8, 6 empty, 9, 5 body, 8, 4 empty, 8, 7 body). Moving to (7, 4) generally feels like it maintains more escape routes and flexibility.\n\nI will prioritize A5 (7, 4), continuing the path established last turn.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T=60 onwards):**\nH1 at (7, 4). Target A2 (8, 1) or look for movement options to control the lower-left quadrant (A4). Since the body is very long, maintaining clear exit paths is key. (7, 4) is a good staging point.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

I must move LEFT or RIGHT.\n\n*   **Option 1: RIGHT to (8, 4).**\n    *   Safe.

It also keeps me near the board edge, which is currently occupied heavily by my own tail.\n\n*   **Option 2: LEFT to (6, 4).**\n    *   Safe. This moves me away from A3 (8, 5) (distance increases to 3).\n    *   It moves me towards A5 (5, 2) (distance reduces to 3).\n    *   This path leads into the central, less congested area, potentially setting up a move towards A5 (5, 2) or A4 (2, 1). However, the central area is prone to being cut off if Snake 0 moves towards the bottom half. Snake 0 is at (3, 8).\n\n**4. Strategic Decision:**\n\nA3 (8, 5) is the closest apple (MD 2). Moving RIGHT to (8, 4) targets A3 directly, making it 1 move away for the next turn.\n\n(7, 4) -> (8, 4) [RIGHT]\nT=61: (8, 4) -> (8, 5) [UP, eats A3].\n\nThis seems the optimal immediate shortest path to an apple.\n\n**5. Enemy Snake #0 Threat (H0 at (3, 8)):**\nH0 is at (3, 8).\nPossible safe moves for H0: (2, 8) [Backward, Kill], (3, 9) [Up, Safe], (4, 8) [Right, Safe], (3, 7) [Down, Safe].\nH0 is very far from me (Manhattan distance 8). No collision threat.\n\n**6. Final Move Pick:**\nRIGHT, to position for eating A3 (8, 5) next turn.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T=61 onwards):**\n1. Move UP to (8, 5) to eat A3.\n2. From (8, 5), target A2 (8, 1) by moving straight down column 8 if possible, or A5 (5, 2) if necessary to maintain space. Given column 8 is currently restricted by my body segments (8, 3 and 8, 2), pathing down might require moving LEFT first.\n\nCurrent state of column 8 and 9 (My body: T):\n 9 . . . . . . . T T .\n 8 T T T 0 . . . T T .\n 7 T T T T T . . T T T\n 6 . T T T . . . T . T\n 5 . T T T . . . T A T\n 4 . . . . . . . 1 . T <--- 1 is at (7, 4)\n 3 . . . . . . . T T T\n 2 . . . . . A .

Can move RIGHT to (9, 5) (body, bad), LEFT to (7, 5) (body, bad), DOWN to (8, 4) (body, bad), UP to (8, 6) (safe). I might get temporarily boxed in if I move to (8, 5).\n\nLet's re-evaluate (8, 5) for T=62 when I get there:\nMy body segments around (8, 5) are: (7, 5) new body, (9, 5) body, (8, 7) earlier body. (8, 6) is safe. (8, 4) becomes the second segment (tail moves from (7, 3) to (7, 2)). Wait, my length is 18.\nHead (8, 5)\nBody: (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), ...\n\nIf I eat A3 at (8, 5):\nH1: (8, 5).\nBody (T=61): (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2). Length 19.\n\nAt (8, 5) (T=61 end):\n(9, 5) T\n(7, 5) T\n(8, 4) T\n(8, 6) . (Safe, UP)\nI can move UP to (8, 6). This is safe and keeps me along the right edge.\n\nThis path remains the best option.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait \u2014 looking at board state: row 9 col 3 is '.' (empty). That\u2019s safe from immediate collision.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 7): That\u2019s part of my own body (my body list shows (3,7) as segment 13). That would kill me.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 8): That\u2019s part of my own body (first segment after head). That would kill me.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 8): According to board state, row 8 col 4 is '.' (empty). Not in my body (my body ends at (4,7) nearby but not (4,8)). Not in enemy body (Snake #1\u2019s body has no (4,8)).  \n\nSo safe moves: UP and RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy movement and head-on collision risk**  \nEnemy #1 head at (7, 4). Possible moves from there:  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 5): Apple at (8,5) nearby but not same cell.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 3): Part of its own body? Its body: [(7,5), (7,6), ..., (7,3) is last segment? Wait, body list: (7,4) head, then (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2), (7,3)]. Yes, (7,3) is last segment of its body (tail). So DOWN for enemy would kill it, so enemy likely avoids DOWN.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 4): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 4): empty.  \n\nEnemy safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nMy UP to (3,9) is far from enemy head, so no head-on collision possible.  \nMy RIGHT to (4,8) is also far from enemy head.  \nSo both moves safe from enemy head-on this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future options from each safe move**  \nFrom (3, 9):  \n- Possible moves next turn: DOWN (back to (3,8) which is my old head position, but that cell will be empty next turn? Wait, my body will move forward, so (3,8) becomes my neck segment after this move, so next turn DOWN from (3,9) \u2192 (3,8) is my own body? Let\u2019s simulate: If I move UP now to (3,9), my body becomes: head (3,9), then old head (3,8) becomes segment 2, then (2,8), etc. So (3,8) is occupied next turn by my body. So DOWN from (3,9) next turn would be suicide.  \n- LEFT from (3,9) \u2192 (2,9): '.' empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT from (3,9) \u2192 (4,9): '.' empty, safe.  \nSo from (3,9), next turn safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT only (DOWN unsafe). That\u2019s only 2 safe moves, could get trapped along top row if not careful.\n\nFrom (4, 8):  \n- UP \u2192 (4,9): empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,7): That\u2019s my body segment (last segment in list is (4,7)). So next turn DOWN from (4,8) would be into own body? Let\u2019s check: If I move RIGHT now to (4,8), my body shifts: new head (4,8), then (3,8), (2,8), etc. (4,7) is at end of my body currently, but after move, (4,7) will be second-to-last segment? Wait, body length 15 (head + 14 segments). After move without eating apple, last segment disappears (tail moves). So (4,7) might be gone next turn? Let\u2019s trace: current body: head (3,8), body[1]=(2,8), body[2]=(1,8), ..., body[13]=(3,7), body[14]=(4,7). After moving RIGHT to (4,8) without eating apple, new head (4,8), new body[1] = old head (3,8), body[2] = old body[1] (2,8), ..., body[14] = old body[13] (3,7). So (4,7) is removed (tail moved from (4,7) to (3,7)? Actually tail was (4,7), after shift tail becomes (3,7). So (4,7) is empty next turn. So DOWN from (4,8) next turn is safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,8): will be my neck next turn, so unsafe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,8): empty.  \n\nSo from (4,8), next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options). That\u2019s better future flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (1,0), (8,1), (8,5), (2,1), (5,2).  \nFrom (3,8):  \n- UP to (3,9) \u2192 moves away from apples mostly.  \n- RIGHT to (4,8) \u2192 slightly closer to (5,2) in Manhattan distance?  \nActually:  \n(3,8) to (5,2): |3-5|+|8-2| = 2+6=8.  \n(4,8) to (5,2): |4-5|+|8-2| = 1+6=7. Yes, closer.  \nAlso (4,8) to (8,5): |4-8|+|8-5| = 4+3=7 vs from (3,8): 5+3=8, so closer.  \n\nSo RIGHT is slightly better for apple access.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nI\u2019m behind in apples (14 vs 17). Need to target closest apples safely. (5,2) is closest apple in terms of path through open area, but need to avoid enemy near right side. Enemy #1 is long and mostly on right side, so descending column 4 or 5 might be safe if enemy moves away. Next turn from (4,8) I could go DOWN to (4,7) (now empty), then further down toward (5,2).  \n\nPlan: Move RIGHT now to (4,8), then next turn likely DOWN to (4,7), then RIGHT to (5,7) etc., working toward (5,2). Keep checking enemy head movement to avoid collision.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\nDOWN (8, 3): Body T. (8, 3) is in the list. DEAD.\nLEFT (7, 4): Body T. (7, 4) is the segment behind me. DEAD.\nRIGHT (9, 4): Body T. (9, 4) is in the list.

Yes, 15th segment.\n(7, 4)? Yes, 1st segment (backwards move).\n(9, 4)? Yes, 13th segment.\n\nConclusion: UP is the only survival move for Turn 61. I will address the T=62 trap in the next turn if I survive the game state update.\n\nUP",

(Note: The provided input body list is slightly confusingly formatted; it includes (8, 4) which was the original head position *before* T=61.

Safe?\n2.  **DOWN (8, 4):** Previous head position/Tail segment. **T**. KILLS ME (Body segment).\n3.  **LEFT (7, 5):** Body segment. **T**. KILLS ME.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 5):** Body segment. **T**. KILLS ME.\n\nBased on the surrounding T representation, only UP to (8, 6) is immediately safe this turn.\n\n**(8, 4), (7, 5), (9, 5)** are all T on the board, meaning they are part of my current snake body.\n\n**2.

Move Evaluation - Survival at T=62:**\nI am forced to move UP to (8, 6).\n\n**4. Future Trap Assessment (T=63 survival):**\nIf I move H1 to (8, 6) at T=62. H1 will be at (8, 6). Length is 19 (since no apple eaten).\nThe previous head position (8, 5) becomes a new body segment. The tail (7, 2 from the previous state, but (7, 3) if we properly account for the shift up to (8, 4) then (7, 4)... wait, let's use the provided body structure and see what falls off).\nThe body list provided in the input is H->T starting from the segment *behind* the head:\n(8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2). (18 segments).\nAfter T=61 (eating apple), the new body is: (8, 5) -> (8, 4) -> (7, 4) -> ... -> (8, 2) -> (7, 2). (19 segments).\n\nIf I move to (8, 6) at T=62 (no apple eaten, length 19).\nNew Head: (8, 6).\nNew Body: (8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2). (The tail (7, 2) clears).\n\nNeighbors of H1 at (8, 6) for T=63:\n*   (8, 7): Body segment. T.\n*   (7, 6): Body segment. T.\n*   (9, 6): Body segment. T.\n*   (8, 5): Previous head position. T.\n\nYes, (8, 6) is a guaranteed death trap for T=63, unless an apple magically appears at one of the adjacent body segments cleared by the tail movement, or if an enemy snake dies and frees a path.\nThe tail clears (7, 2). This does not free up (8, 7), (7, 6), (9, 6), or (8, 5).\n\nSince I am faced with a certain death at T=63, after the only safe move at T=62, I must choose the safe move now and hope for an external miracle (like the enemy snake dies and frees up space, or a new apple spawns nearby). However, I cannot assume miracles.\n\n**Alternative Check: Long-Range Targets**\nIf I survive T=62:\nH1: (8, 6). The path is completely blocked. I cannot reach A2 (8, 1), A3 (2, 1), A4 (5, 2), or A5 (9, 8).\n\nIs there any possibility that the board display is misleading and some of those 'T' cells are actually about to clear?\nLength 19. Tail is (7, 2). It clears at T=63.\nH1 (8, 6). I need to move from (8, 6) to a non-body cell at T=63. All neighbors are body cells: (8, 7), (7, 6), (9, 6), (8, 5). I am trapped.\n\nThis means the previous move (UP to (8, 5)) was strategically poor, despite being the only safe choice defensively at that moment.\n\nSince the rules require me to choose a move that *does not immediately kill me*, and UP is the only such move, I must choose UP.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T=63 onwards):**\nI anticipate dying at T=63 if no external factor changes the board state. If I miraculously survive (e.g., if one of the surrounding cells was previously occupied by an enemy snake that dies, but there is no enemy snake adjacent to (8, 6) anyway), I must try to move LEFT or DOWN the board to reach apples A2 (8, 1) or A4 (5, 2). But since this outcome is highly unlikely, my primary directive is constrained to T=62 survival.\n\nThe move must be UP.\n\nUP",

Length: 15.\n*   Apples: A1 (1, 0), A2 (8, 1), A3 (2, 1), A4 (5, 2), A5 (9, 8).\n\n**1. Danger Assessment (H1 at (8, 6)):**\nI recognized in the previous turn's rationale that moving to (8, 6) put me in a seemingly inescapable trap. I must now verify if I can survive Turn 63.\n\nMy body segments (H->T): (8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2). (18 body segments + head = 19 length).\nThe tail segment at the end of this turn's movement will disappear, which is (8, 2).\n\nNeighbors of H1 (8, 6):\n1.  **UP (8, 7):** Snake 1 Body (T). **DEAD**.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 5):** Previous head position/Snake 1 Body (T). **DEAD**.\n3.  **LEFT (7, 6):** Snake 1 Body (T). **DEAD**.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 6):** Snake 1 Body (T). **DEAD**.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the coordinates provided for the body segments in the game state:\nBody: [(8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2)]\n\nLet's check the neighbors of H1 (8, 6) against this body list:\n1. (8, 7) is in the body list. Kills me.\n2. (8, 5) is in the body list. Kills me (Moving backwards).\n3. (7, 6) is in the body list. Kills me.\n4. (9, 6) is in the body list. Kills me.\n\n**Conclusion:** I am completely blocked and will die this turn, as predicted by the T=62 rationale. All four moves result in immediate collision with my own body segments, none of which clear this turn because the tail segment (8, 2) is too far away to free up path for the head trapped at (8, 6).\n\nIf all moves lead to certain death, I must choose the one that might lead to a head-on collision instead, as sometimes the rules prioritize those death conditions slightly differently, though usually self-collision is checked first. Since there is no enemy snake immediately adjacent, suicide is the only option.\n\nIn situations where all four moves lead to death (usually by self-collision), the specific move chosen does not matter for survival, but for completeness, I will pick one arbitrarily. I will choose the move that attempts to move away from the enemy snake (to my left/down-left).\n\nLet's choose LEFT, moving into (7, 6).\n\n**Self-Correction/Sanity Check on the trap:**\nWhere did the strategy go wrong?\nT=60: H1 at (8, 4). Move UP to (8, 5) and eat an apple. (Length = 19).\nT=61: H1 at (8, 5). Only safe move was UP to (8, 6). (Length = 19).\nT=62: H1 at (8, 6). Trapped.\n\nThe mistake happened by entering the block of T segments that left (8, 6) surrounded. Given the extremely dense local structure of my snake, finding an exit path was critical two turns ago, and I prioritized the immediate apple (at 8, 5), which locked me in.\n\nSince death is unavoidable, I must submit a move.\n\nLEFT\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nN/A. Snake 1 is trapped and will self-collide this turn.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\nLEFT",
