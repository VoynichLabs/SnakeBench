          "rationale": "**Current state**\n- My head: (7,1), length 1 (no body).\n- Apples: (1,5), (6,9), (2,6), (5,8), (8,5). I'm closest to (8,5) (distance 4 up = Manhattan 4).\n- Enemy: Snake #0 at (8,3), body [(8,2)], length 2.\n\n**Safe moves**\n- UP: (7,2) \u2013 safe (on board, not into any body).\n- RIGHT: (8,1) \u2013 safe.\n- DOWN: (7,0) \u2013 safe.\n- LEFT: (6,1) \u2013 safe.\n\n**Enemies' possible moves**\nSnake #0 at (8,3) with body [(8,2)]:\n- Can move UP to (8,4), RIGHT to (9,3), LEFT to (7,3), or DOWN to (8,2).\n- If it moves DOWN to (8,2), that would be into its own body, so it cannot move DOWN.\n- If it moves LEFT to (7,3), it will occupy (7,3) next turn.\n- If it moves UP to (8,4), it will occupy (8,4) next turn.\n- If it moves RIGHT to (9,3), it will occupy (9,3) next turn.\n\n**Avoiding head-on collisions**\n- My UP to (7,2) is safe now. If Snake #0 moves LEFT to (7,3), it will be above me at (7,3), no collision.\n- My RIGHT to (8,1) is safe now. If Snake #0 moves UP to (8,4), it will be above me at (8,4), no collision.\n- My DOWN to (7,0) is safe now.\n- My LEFT to (6,1) is safe now.\n\n**Path to nearest apple**\nNearest apple: (8,5) (distance 4 up = Manhattan 4).\nFrom (7,1) to (8,5): need +1 x and +4 y. One direct route: RIGHT to (8,1), then UP four times to (8,5).\n- RIGHT to (8,1) is safe and keeps the path to (8,5) open. If Snake #0 moves LEFT to (7,3) or UP to (8,4), I can still proceed UP to (8,2), UP to (8,3), UP to (8,4), UP to (8,5). If Snake #0 moves UP to (8,4), it would occupy (8,4) next turn; I would be at (8,2) if I move RIGHT then UP twice, or at (8,1) if I move RIGHT only. No conflict at (8,4) if I'm below it.\n- UP to (7,2) moves away from the apple (now distance to (8,5) is 1 right + 3 up = 4, same as before), but keeps options open. Next moves could be RIGHT to (8,2), UP to (8,3), UP to (8,4), UP to (8,5).\n- DOWN to (7,0) moves away from the apple; not preferred.\n- LEFT to (6,1) moves away; not preferred.\n\n**Choice**\n- RIGHT to (8,1) is safe and directly heads toward (8,5). It avoids potential conflicts with Snake #0's possible moves. Even if Snake #0 moves UP to (8,4), I can still reach (8,5) by moving UP to (8,2), UP to (8,3), UP to (8,4) (but that would be into Snake #0's head if it's at (8,4) next turn). Wait: if Snake #0 moves UP to (8,4) next turn, then at turn 4 it would be at (8,4). If I move RIGHT to (8,1), then UP to (8,2), UP to (8,3), UP to (8,4) at turn 4, I would be moving into (8,4) while Snake #0 is there, causing a head-on collision and both dying. So I must avoid that.\n- If I move RIGHT to (8,1), then UP to (8,2), UP to (8,3), then UP to (8,4) at turn 4, I risk collision if Snake #0 moves UP to (8,4). To avoid that, I could move UP to (8,4) at turn 3, but that's not possible because I'm at (8,1) at turn 3. So the safe path is RIGHT to (8,1), UP to (8,2), UP to (8,3), then at turn 4, if Snake #0 is at (8,4), I should move RIGHT to (9,3), then UP to (9,4), LEFT to (8,4), UP to (8,5). That's longer but avoids collision.\n- Alternatively, moving UP to (7,2) keeps me away from Snake #0's possible positions. From (7,2), RIGHT to (8,2) is safe (Snake #0's body is at (8,2) now, but if it moves UP to (8,4), then (8,2) is empty next turn). So UP to (7,2), RIGHT to (8,2), UP to (8,3), UP to (8,4). If Snake #0 is at (8,4), I cannot move UP to (8,4), so I should move RIGHT to (9,4), LEFT to (8,4), UP to (8,5). This is also longer.\n- Given the above, moving RIGHT to (8,1) is the most direct route to (8,5) and is safe. Even if Snake #0 moves UP to (8,4), I can adjust my path at turn 4 to avoid collision.\n\n**Long-term plan note**\n- After RIGHT to (8,1), proceed UP to (8,2), UP to (8,3), then UP to (8,4) if Snake #0 is not at (8,4). If Snake #0 is at (8,4), move RIGHT to (9,4), LEFT to (8,4), UP to (8,5).\n- Keep monitoring Snake #0's head; if it moves into a dead-end or eats an apple and grows, adjust my path.\n- After eating (8,5), aim for the next closest apple (5,8) or (6,9), planning routes that avoid tight spaces.\n- Always prefer moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available and avoid potential head-on collisions.\n\nRIGHT",

However, moving LEFT keeps me further from the enemy's potential moves (enemy can move DOWN to (8,5) or LEFT to (7,6), which are closer to my UP position (7,4)). Moving LEFT also avoids potential future head-on collisions near the enemy's path.\n\n**Choice**\n- LEFT to (6,3) is safe, shortens the path to the next apple, and keeps me further from the enemy's likely moves.\n- UP to (7,4) is safe and also shortens the path to the next apple, but brings me closer to the enemy.\n- DOWN to (7,2) is safe but increases the path to the next apple.\n\n**Long-term plan note**\nAfter eating the apple at (7,3), I will aim for the next closest apple (6,9) or (5,8). Moving LEFT to (6,3) now aligns better with reaching (6,9) directly. I will continue to avoid the enemy's path and keep my options open.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy's possible moves are at (7,8), (8,7), (6,7). None are (6,4), so no head-on collision.\n- My DOWN to (6,2) is safe now. Enemy's possible moves are at (7,8), (8,7), (6,7). None are (6,2), so no head-on collision.\n- My LEFT to (5,3) is safe now. Enemy's possible moves are at (7,8), (8,7), (6,7). None are (5,3), so no head-on collision.\n\n**Path to next apple**\n- The closest apple by Manhattan distance is (9,1) (distance 5). The next closest are (6,9) and (5,8) (distance 6 each).\n- Moving RIGHT to (7,3) is unsafe (into my body).\n- Moving DOWN to (6,2) brings me closer to (9,1): distance decreases from 5 to 4 (1 down + 3 right).\n- Moving LEFT to (5,3) brings me closer to (5,8): distance decreases from 6 to 5 (5 left + 5 up).\n- Moving UP to (6,4) brings me closer to (6,9): distance decreases from 6 to 5 (0 left/right + 5 up).\n\n**Future considerations**\n- Moving DOWN to (6,2) aligns well with reaching (9,1). After (9,1), I can aim for (5,8) or (6,9).\n- Moving LEFT to (5,3) aligns well with reaching (5,8). After (5,8), I can aim for (6,9).\n- Moving UP to (6,4) aligns well with reaching (6,9). After (6,9), I can aim for (5,8).\n- The enemy is at (7,7). Moving LEFT to (5,3) keeps me furthest from the enemy's possible moves (6,7), (7,8), (8,7). Moving DOWN to (6,2) keeps me further than moving UP to (6,4) but closer than moving LEFT.\n\n**Choice**\n- All three safe moves keep me alive and move me closer to an apple.\n- Moving LEFT to (5,3) keeps me furthest from the enemy and shortens the path to (5,8).\n- Moving DOWN to (6,2) shortens the path to (9,1) and keeps me further from the enemy than moving UP.\n- Moving UP to (6,4) shortens the path to (6,9) but brings me closer to the enemy's possible moves.\n\nAmong these, moving DOWN to (6,2) balances safety (furthest from enemy after UP) and progress toward an apple (9,1). It avoids the immediate proximity to the enemy's possible moves while still making progress.\n\n**Long-term plan note**\nAfter this move, I will be at (6,2) with body [(6,3), (7,3), (8,3)]. I will aim for the apple at (9,1). After eating (9,1), I will reassess to target the next closest apple (5,8) or (6,9), keeping the enemy's position in mind and avoiding head-on collisions.\n\nDOWN",

Eating it will increase the score and grow the snake. After the move the head will be at (2,8) and the body will extend onto (1,8). From (2,8) we retain three safe directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) for the next turn, preserving options and avoiding immediate self\u2011collision. The opponent\u2019s head is far away at (1,3) and cannot reach (2,8) this turn, so no head\u2011on collision is possible.  \n\nThus RIGHT provides the best combination of immediate reward and maximal future flexibility.\n\nRIGHT",
