Strategy:**\nMoving RIGHT is my most efficient move as it captures the immediate apple at (6, 5). Snake #1 is closer to the apple at (7, 9) or (0, 6) relative to their position, and they cannot contest (6, 5) this turn.

However, taking the initiative to grab (7, 3) is better for scoring.\n\nPlan: Head towards apple (7, 3). Moving DOWN first is slightly safer from a potential vertical chase than moving directly into the same column as the enemy.\n\n**PLAN:** Move towards (7, 3) via (6, 4). Avoid a head-on collision at column 7 if the enemy moves down aggressively.\n\nDOWN",

Directly onto an apple.\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Movement (Snake #1 at 1, 6):**\nSnake #1 is almost certainly moving LEFT to (0, 6) to eat that apple. They are very far from my current position at (3, 0).\n\n**4. Strategic Choice:**\nMoving LEFT to (2, 0) captures an apple immediately, increasing my length and score. My body will follow, and since the tail is at (6, 1), the path behind me is clearing. After (2, 0), I have a choice between (0, 0) and (1, 1). Given (1, 1) is \"inland,\" it is usually safer than the corner, but both are very accessible.\n\n**PLAN:** Move LEFT to (2, 0) to collect the apple. Next turn, I will likely move LEFT again toward (1, 0) to position for either (0, 0) or (1, 1).\n\nLEFT",

If I move RIGHT now, I get further from (2, 1) and might have to circle back through my own body later.\n\n**4. Safety Check for (3, 1):**\n- (3, 1) is empty. \n- (3, 1) is not adjacent to Snake #1's head (no collision risk).\n- All snake body parts will move one step forward, clearing (3, 0) by the time I might want to move there, though I am heading to (2, 1).\n\n**PLAN:** Move DOWN to (3, 1) to position myself to take the apple at (2, 1) on the next turn.

Moving UP to (4, 2) is safe as long as I then move RIGHT or UP again.\n   - Snake #1 is at (3, 8), currently moving around the top section of the board. It is not an immediate threat to the apples at row 2.\n   - Tail movement: Since I did not eat an apple last turn, my tail at (1, 1) will move to (1, 2). The body is slowly vacating the bottom-left area.\n\n4. **Strategic Decision:**\n   Move UP to (4, 2). This positions me perfectly to start a \"sweep\" of the row 2 apples (5,2), (6,2), and (8,2) starting from next turn.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (4, 2), then move RIGHT to collect the cluster of apples at (5, 2), (6, 2), and (8, 2).

If I move RIGHT to (9, 3), there is no possibility of a head-on collision this turn.\n- My body is currently occupying a horizontal line on y=2 and the bottom left corner. Moving to (9, 3) keeps me on the edge, allowing my body to follow safely.\n\n4. **Strategic Decision**:\nMoving **RIGHT** to (9, 3) is the most logical choice.

My tail at (2, 1) is moving away from the area Snake #1 is currently in.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (8, 5) is the most efficient move. It collects an apple and keeps me away from the wall.\n- Snake #1 is likely targeting apples at (5, 4), (3, 7), or (2, 8). I am currently winning in score and have plenty of open space in the top-right quadrant (x: 5-9, y: 5-9).\n\n4. **Strategic Decision**:\nMove **LEFT** to (8, 5). This collects the closest apple immediately. Afterward, I will look to move towards (7, 8) while maintaining distance from the enemy snake and not trapping my own head against my body or the walls.\n\n**Plan**: Move LEFT to take the apple at (8, 5). Then, move UP and LEFT toward the apple at (7, 8).\n\nLEFT",

Body is long (17 segments), curling around the right and bottom. \n- **Enemy (Snake #1)**: Head at (4, 8). If they move UP, they hit (4, 9). If they move RIGHT, they hit (5, 8).\n- **Collision Risk**: \n    - If I move **DOWN** to (5, 8), and Snake #1 moves **RIGHT**, we will have a head-on collision at (5, 8).\n    - If I move **LEFT** to (4, 9), and Snake #1 moves **UP**, we will have a head-on collision at (4, 9).\n- **Snake #1's Constraints**: Snake #1 is at (4, 8). Its body is at (4, 7), (3, 7), etc. Their only safe moves are UP (4, 9), LEFT (3, 9), or RIGHT (5, 8). \n- **Assessment**: Moving DOWN to (5, 8) is risky because of the head-on potential. Moving LEFT to (4, 9) is also risky. However, looking at the board, (5, 8) is actually occupied by the apple at (6, 8) in the text description? No, looking at coordinates: Apples are at (5, 4), (0, 6), (7, 3), (0, 3), (6, 8). (5, 8) is empty.\n- Actually, (6, 8) is an apple. If I move DOWN to (5, 8) and then RIGHT to (6, 8), I get an apple. \n- Let's look at the enemy's best move. They likely want to escape the corner or get the apple at (6, 8). \n\n**Plan:**\nI will move DOWN to (5, 8). Even if Snake #1 tries to move there for a head-on collision, I must maintain board presence. However, to be safer against a head-on, LEFT to (4, 9) leads towards the edge. DOWN is more central. Wait, Snake #1 is at (4,8). (4,9) is more likely for them to take to avoid their own body. I will take the move that keeps me most mobile.\n\nDOWN",

That risk makes RIGHT unsafe.  \n- Moving **UP** would go to (4,\u202f9). The cell is empty, not part of my body, and not currently occupied by any snake. Even if the opponent moves DOWN to (5,\u202f8) or LEFT to (4,\u202f9), they would not land on (4,\u202f9) simultaneously with me, so no collision occurs.  \n\n**Plan for the next few turns**  \n- Take the safe UP move to stay alive.  \n- From (4,\u202f9) I can later move LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN.  \n- My priority will be to head toward the reachable apple at (6,\u202f8) while keeping options open (avoid the top\u2011row dead\u2011end by not moving further up).  \n- Keep an eye on the opponent\u2019s head; if it ever moves toward the cell I plan to enter, choose an alternate direction.\n\nUP\nUP",

Moving LEFT now positions me to eventually head rightward toward (6,8) while avoiding immediate death.\n\n**Plan for the next few turns**  \n1. Move LEFT to (3,9) \u2013 the only safe direction this turn.  \n2. From there, aim to head DOWN toward the apple at (6,8) while monitoring the opponent\u2019s movements.  \n3. Keep options open by not committing to a single direction too early; always re\u2011evaluate safety each turn.\n\nLEFT",

I will choose **DOWN** to (6, 4) because it moves me more cleanly into the open space in the middle-bottom of the board, allowing me to pivot to (5, 4), (7, 3), or (6, 0) based on how the enemy moves. The enemy is currently trapped in the top-left and isn't a threat to the apples in the bottom half yet.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nCapture (5, 4) next, then evaluate the path to (7, 3) or (6, 0).

My body is currently occupying a significant portion of the right side, so moving left/down into the open center-bottom area is ideal for maintaining maneuverability.

Safe. This is adjacent to apple (3, 6).\n2.  **DOWN:** Moves to (4, 4). **Invalid** (Backwards into body).\n3.  **LEFT:** Moves to (3, 5). Safe. Positions me to take (3, 6) next turn.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Moves to (5, 5). Safe. Moves toward the empty right-side area, but blocked by body at x=6.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- **Apple (3, 6):** I am at (4, 5). I can reach (3, 6) in two moves: [LEFT, UP] or [UP, LEFT].\n- **Snake #1:** Its head is at (0, 5). It can reach (3, 6) in 4 moves if it goes through (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 6). I have a clear lead on this apple.\n- **Space Management:** My body currently forms a large loop on the right side. The tail is at (9, 3) and will continue to move. The bottom-right quadrant contains three apples: (6, 1), (6, 0), and (7, 3).\n- **Conflict:** Moving LEFT to (3, 5) puts me on the same Y-axis as Snake #1. If Snake #1 moves RIGHT, it moves toward (1, 5).\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **LEFT** to (3, 5) is the most direct path to (3, 6) while keeping the most options open for the center-left board. After taking (3, 6), I will likely circle back down to the bottom apples as my tail clears out of the (7,3) area.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nGrab (3, 6). Then, evaluate if I can safely reach (0, 3) or if I should head down toward the cluster at (6, 1), (6, 0), and (7, 3). Note that Snake #1 is very close to (0, 3), so that apple is likely lost. Priority is (3, 6) then moving toward the bottom-right.\n\nLEFT",

This **collects an apple** immediately. After moving to (2, 6), I will be at (2, 6) with Snake #1's head at (0, 3) or (1, 3). This is very safe.\n2.  **UP:** Moves to (3, 7). Safe, but no immediate reward.\n3.  **DOWN:** Moves to (3, 5). **Invalid** (Backwards into body).\n4.  **RIGHT:** Moves to (4, 6). Safe, but moves into a tighter space near my own body.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- **Apple at (2, 6):** I am adjacent to it. Snake #1 is at (0, 3) and cannot reach it this turn.\n- **Congestion:** My body occupies a large portion of the right side and the middle (x=4 to x=9). The area $(0,0)$ to $(3,3)$ is relatively clear. Snake #1 is positioned in the top-left corner and moving downwards.\n- **Future Planning:** After taking (2, 6), I will look to move further down towards the apple at (0, 2) or cut across the bottom towards (6, 1), (6, 0), and (7, 3). Since my body is currently blocking the path to the right at y=4, 5, 6, I should head towards the bottom-left quadrant first.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nGrab the apple at (2, 6). Then continue moving down to (2, 5) and (2, 4) to navigate around my own body and target the apples at (0, 2), (6, 1), (6, 0), and (7, 3). Avoid getting pinned against the left wall by Snake #1.\n\nLEFT",

My body forms a vertical wall at X=2 and X=6. \n- Moving DOWN to (1, 3) puts me closer to the apple clusters at the bottom right, but (1, 3) is adjacent to the enemy snake's body at (0, 3). \n- Moving UP to (1, 5) gives more space to maneuver but moves away from the current apples.\n- Looking at the board, if I go DOWN to (1, 3), my next move could be (2, 3) (if Snake #1 moves away) or (1, 2) (danger, snake body). \n- If I go DOWN to (1, 3), and then Snake #1 moves towards (5, 2), a path opens up through the middle. However, the space at X=1 and X=2 is quite narrow.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (1, 3). This keeps me mobile and positions me to potentially slip underneath my own body wall at Y=4 to chase the apples at (5, 2), (7, 3), or the bottom cluster (6, 1), (6, 0). I must be careful not to get pinned against Snake #1's body on the far left.\n\nDOWN",

This is **SAFE**. The cell is currently empty. Snake #1 is at (5, 2). Even if Snake #1 moves UP to (5, 3), we do not collide.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- I am currently very restricted. To the left and up is my own body; to the left and down is Snake #1's body.\n- The only viable path forward is to the RIGHT.\n- Snake #1 just ate an apple at (5, 2) and is now right next to the cluster of apples at (6, 1), (6, 0), and (7, 3).\n- Moving RIGHT to (3, 3) gives me breathing room and allows me to attempt to contest the apple at (7, 3) or find a gap to escape the self-inflicted maze I'm currently in.\n- Note: Snake #1's body blocks (3, 2) and (2, 2), while my own body blocks (2, 4), (3, 4) is currently open but (4, 4) is blocked by me. (3, 3) is my only logic move.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (3, 3). Continue heading RIGHT toward (7, 3) while keeping an eye on Snake #1's head. I must avoid getting pinned against my own body at Y=4 and Y=5. If Snake #1 moves toward (7, 3), I may need to maneuver to block it or dive for the lower apples if the path opens.\n\nRIGHT",

It could move LEFT to (5, 2), RIGHT to (7, 2), UP to (6, 3), or DOWN to (6, 1). If I move RIGHT to (4, 3) and it moves LEFT to (5, 2), we are adjacent but safe.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (4, 3) to avoid trapping myself in my own body at Y=4/5. Continue toward the apple at (7, 3) if Snake #1 doesn't block it, or pivot downward to sweep the apples at (6, 1) and (6, 0) once Snake #1's body moves through.\n\nRIGHT",

This keeps me in open space compared to moving into my own body loops at x=1-4.

This move is safe and keeps me away from the enemy.\n2.  **DOWN:** Moves to (7, 2). **Death/Hazard.** Snake #1's head is at (7, 1). If Snake #1 moves UP to (7, 2), we will have a head-on collision. Furthermore, Snake #1's body occupies (6, 2). Moving DOWN puts me in a very tight spot near the enemy.\n3.  **LEFT:** Moves to (6, 3). **Death.** This is my neck/backwards move.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Moves to (8, 3). **Safe.** (8, 3) is empty.

The enemy head at (7, 1) is very close. If I move RIGHT, I risk being pinned against the right edge (x=9) if the enemy moves to blockade me. If I move UP, I maintain more central board control and distance from Snake #1. \n\nMoving UP to (7, 4) allows me to eventually loop toward the apples at (8, 9) or (2, 9) while keeping my distance from Snake #1, which is currently concentrated in the lower-left and bottom area. Moving RIGHT to (8, 3) is also viable to grab (9, 2) and then head UP. However, (9, 2) is a corner-adjacent apple which can be a trap. \n\nI will choose UP to maintain flexibility and safety from the enemy snake.\n\nUP",

By moving UP, I stay well away from its current head position and start moving towards the high-value area. Moving RIGHT to (9, 4) is also safe, but moving UP to (8, 5) is more direct for the long-term goal of reaching the top-right corner. Given the board layout, I want to avoid being pinned against the right wall by my own tail later.\n\nUP moves me away from the potential conflict at (8, 3) and (9, 2) while maintaining a safe distance from my own body segments at (6, 5)-(6, 8).\n\nUP",

If I move RIGHT to (9, 6), I am only two units away from the enemy's path. Moving UP to (8, 7) maintains a buffer and continues my trajectory toward my goal (8, 9).

This is safe and directly toward the apple at (8, 9).\n2.  **DOWN:** Moves to (8, 6). **Death** (Neck).\n3.  **LEFT:** Moves to (7, 7). Safe, but leads into a somewhat cramped area depending on tail movement. (6, 6) is currently occupied by my tail, which will move, but the area is less open than moving toward the top.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Moves to (9, 7). Safe. This is a fine path, but staying on column 8 is more efficient for the target apple.\n\n**Collision Check:**\nEnemy at (8, 3) is far away. Its head is at (8, 3); it could move to (8, 4), (7, 3), or (9, 3). However, (8, 4) is my body and (9, 3) is its own body. Its only safe move is LEFT toward (7, 3), which is also my body. Actually, looking at the coordinates: Snake 1 head is (8, 3), its segment (9, 3) is behind it. It cannot move RIGHT. It cannot move LEFT to (7, 3) because that is my body. It cannot move UP to (8, 4) because that is my body. Its ONLY move is DOWN to (8, 2) which is its own body? No, wait.\nLet's re-verify Snake 1's position: Head (8, 3), Body [(9,3), (9,2), (8,2)...].\nSnake 1 is at (8,3).\n- UP (8, 4): My body (8,4).\n- DOWN (8, 2): Its own body (8,2).\n- LEFT (7, 3): My body (7,3).\n- RIGHT (9, 3): Its own body (9,3).\nSnake 1 appears to be in a position where all moves lead to a collision.
