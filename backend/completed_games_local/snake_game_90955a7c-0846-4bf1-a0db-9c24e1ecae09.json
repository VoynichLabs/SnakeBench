My snake has only a head, no body yet.  \n\n**Apples:** (7,7), (9,2), (0,1), (8,3), (8,0).  \n\n**Enemy snake #1:** Head at (0,4), body at (0,3), length 2.  \n\n**Possible moves:**  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 3)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 1)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 2)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 2)  \n\n**Check for immediate death:**  \n1. No body segments yet, so no self-collision possible.  \n2. Enemy body: (0,3) and head (0,4). None of my target cells are enemy body currently.  \n3. Off-board? All moves are within 0\u20139 in x and y.  \n\nSo all 4 moves are **immediately safe**.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy head possible moves from (0,4):**  \n- UP to (0,5)  \n- DOWN to (0,3) \u2014 into its own body \u2192 would kill it, so enemy likely avoids.  \n- LEFT to (-1,4) \u2192 off-board \u2192 would kill it, so enemy avoids.  \n- RIGHT to (1,4)  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe moves are UP to (0,5) or RIGHT to (1,4).  \n\n---\n\n**Head-on collision risk:**  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (1,4), that\u2019s not any of my target cells.  \nIf enemy moves UP to (0,5), also not my target cells.  \nSo no immediate head-on collision possible this turn regardless of my move.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple is (0,1) at Manhattan distance |2-0| + |2-1| = 3.  \n- UP (2,3): distance to (0,1) = |2| + |2| = 4 (farther)  \n- DOWN (2,1): distance = |2| + |0| = 2 (closer)  \n- LEFT (1,2): distance = |1| + |1| = 2 (closer)  \n- RIGHT (3,2): distance = |3| + |1| = 4 (farther)  \n\nDOWN and LEFT both bring me closer to (0,1).  \n\n---\n\n**Future safety considerations:**  \nIf I go LEFT to (1,2): next turn, enemy could be at (1,4) if it moved RIGHT. Then my possible moves from (1,2): UP (1,3), DOWN (1,1), LEFT (0,2), RIGHT (2,2).  \n- (0,2) is safe unless enemy moves DOWN to (0,3)? No, enemy can\u2019t move DOWN into its body. So enemy won\u2019t be at (0,3).  \nActually, enemy at (1,4) could move DOWN to (1,3) next turn \u2014 that would conflict if I move UP to (1,3) next turn (head-on). But I can avoid that by choosing differently next turn.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (2,1): next turn, enemy at (1,4) could move DOWN to (1,3), then LEFT to (0,3) not possible (its own body), so maybe DOWN again to (1,2)? That would be head-on if I move UP from (2,1) to (2,2)? No, different cells. Actually from (2,1) my possible moves: UP (2,2), DOWN (2,0), LEFT (1,1), RIGHT (3,1). All safe unless enemy moves into them simultaneously.  \n\n---\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT seem safe now and good for apple (0,1).  \nBut DOWN leaves me more central, while LEFT puts me near left wall. With enemy above at (0,4)/(1,4), going LEFT might limit future upward escape routes if enemy comes down.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose **DOWN** to stay flexible.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2,1), check enemy\u2019s new head position. If enemy is at (1,4), be cautious moving UP to (2,2) if enemy might move DOWN to (1,3) \u2014 but head-on only if we pick same cell, which is (2,2) vs (1,3) different, so safe. Actually more concerning: if enemy moves DOWN to (1,3), then my UP to (2,2) is fine; my LEFT to (1,1) is safe; my RIGHT to (3,1) safe. So DOWN seems fine.  \n\nDOWN  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

No enemy body there, not off board, not my body.\n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 0) \u2192 apple at (3, 0) is not here, but (0, 0) is empty? Board shows column 0 row 0 is '.' (empty). Wait, check: At bottom-left (0, 0), board shows '.' (empty). Yes, safe? Not off board, not my body (my body at (1,1)).\n- LEFT \u2192 (-1, 1) \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 1) \u2192 my own body segment \u2192 invalid (moving backwards into your own body kills you).\n\nSo invalid moves: LEFT (off board), RIGHT (into own body).  \nValid moves: UP, DOWN.\n\n**Enemy possible moves from (0, 7):**\nEnemy could go UP (0,8), DOWN (0,6) (into its own body \u2192 invalid), LEFT (-1,7) off board \u2192 invalid, RIGHT (1,7) empty. So enemy valid moves: UP, RIGHT.\n\n**Check collisions:**\n- If I go UP to (0, 2): Enemy could go RIGHT to (1, 7) \u2192 no conflict. Enemy could go UP to (0, 8) \u2192 no conflict. So safe from head-on collision.\n- If I go DOWN to (0, 0): Enemy could go RIGHT to (1, 7) or UP to (0, 8) \u2192 no conflict. Safe from head-on collision.\n\nBoth UP and DOWN are safe from immediate death.\n\n**Future options:**\n- UP to (0, 2): Next moves from there: UP (0, 3), RIGHT (1, 2), LEFT invalid (off board), DOWN back to (0, 1) (occupied by tail next turn? Tail at (1,1) will move? Actually, snake moves forward, so tail moves forward only if no apple eaten. Currently no apple eaten this turn, so tail at (1,1) will move to where? Let's simulate: If I move UP, head goes to (0,2), body segment at (1,1) becomes tail and will move to where? Wait, snake mechanics: Body follows head, so after move, body = [(0,1)]? Actually: head moves to (0,2), then old head (0,1) becomes first body segment, old body (1,1) becomes tail and stays if no growth. Since no apple at (0,2), length stays 2, so new snake: head (0,2), body [(0,1)], tail gone? No, body list is just [(0,1)], length 2. So next turn from (0,2), possible moves: UP (0,3), RIGHT (1,2), DOWN (0,1) \u2014 but (0,1) will be my body then. So DOWN invalid next turn. So from (0,2), only UP and RIGHT valid next turn. That\u2019s a bit limiting.\n- DOWN to (0, 0): Then new head (0,0), body [(0,1)], no apple at (0,0). Next turn from (0,0): possible moves UP (0,1) (body \u2014 invalid), RIGHT (1,0) empty, LEFT off board. So only RIGHT valid next turn \u2192 dead end.\n\nSo UP gives 2 moves next turn, DOWN gives 1 move next turn \u2192 UP better.\n\n**Apples:** Closest apple is (3,0) in terms of Manhattan distance from (0,1): dist= |3-0|+|0-1|=3+1=4. From (0,2) distance to (3,0)= |3-0|+|0-2|=3+2=5 (farther). But from (0,0) distance to (3,0)=3. So DOWN gets me closer to apple (3,0), but next turn only RIGHT move possible, which goes to (1,0), then from (1,0) apple (3,0) is reachable possibly.\n\nBut UP seems safer for options.\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nWe need more apples to win. Enemy at (0,7) is far. I should aim for apple (3,0) possibly via path: go UP now to (0,2), then RIGHT to (1,2), then RIGHT/DOWN to approach (3,0) while keeping options open. Avoid trapping self.\n\n**Final choice:** UP keeps more options open next turn.\n\nUP",

Possible moves from (1, 2):**  \n\n- **UP** \u2192 (1, 3)  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (1, 1)  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0, 2) \u2190 my body segment (tail) is here currently, but tail will move after I move if I don't eat an apple.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 2)  \n\n---\n\n**2. Eliminate dangerous moves:**  \n\n- **LEFT** to (0, 2): That's my body segment. Even though it's only one segment and might move away if I don't eat, but currently it's occupied. Snake rules say moving into any snake's body (including your own) kills you. Since I am not eating an apple this turn (no apple at (0, 2)), my tail will move forward only if I eat an apple. I am not eating an apple at (0, 2), so tail stays at (0, 2) until my head moves away. Actually, wait \u2014 if I move left, my head goes to (0, 2), which is occupied by my body at turn start. That's suicide. So **LEFT is unsafe** unless eating apple makes tail not move? But no apple there, so tail stays. So yes, unsafe.  \n\n- **UP** (1, 3): empty on board.  \n- **DOWN** (1, 1): empty on board.  \n- **RIGHT** (2, 2): empty on board.  \n\nAlso check enemy head movement possibilities: enemy head at (0, 9). Possible enemy moves: UP (0, 10) \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid, DOWN (0, 8) \u2192 into its own body \u2192 suicide unless eating apple at (0, 8)? No apple there, so suicide. LEFT (-1, 9) \u2192 off board. RIGHT (1, 9) \u2192 empty. So likely enemy moves RIGHT to (1, 9) to survive.  \n\nThus enemy not near me. No immediate collision threat with enemy head.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Consider apples and future options:**  \n\nClosest apples: (3, 0) is 2 right, 2 down from me. (9, 2) is far right. (8, 3) is far right and up.  \n\nFrom (1, 2):  \n- UP to (1, 3): moves away from closest apple (3, 0) but toward (8, 3) eventually.  \n- DOWN to (1, 1): moves closer to (3, 0) in y, but still need to go right.  \n- RIGHT to (2, 2): moves closer in x to all right-side apples.  \n\nAlso check immediate next-turn safe moves from each candidate:  \n\n**From (1, 3):**  \n- UP (1, 4) safe  \n- DOWN (1, 2) safe (my old head pos now empty? Actually body segment at (0, 2), (1, 2) empty)  \n- LEFT (0, 3) safe  \n- RIGHT (2, 3) safe \u2192 4 safe moves.  \n\n**From (1, 1):**  \n- UP (1, 2) safe  \n- DOWN (1, 0) safe  \n- LEFT (0, 1) safe  \n- RIGHT (2, 1) safe \u2192 4 safe moves.  \n\n**From (2, 2):**  \n- UP (2, 3) safe  \n- DOWN (2, 1) safe  \n- LEFT (1, 2) safe  \n- RIGHT (3, 2) safe \u2192 4 safe moves.  \n\nAll three safe moves give 4 options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Choose best for apple proximity:**  \n\nClosest apple is (3, 0).  \nFrom (2, 2): distance to (3, 0) = |3-2| + |0-2| = 1 + 2 = 3.  \nFrom (1, 1): distance to (3, 0) = 2 + 1 = 3.  \nFrom (1, 3): distance to (3, 0) = 2 + 3 = 5.  \n\nSo DOWN or RIGHT equally close in Manhattan distance to (3, 0), but RIGHT puts me closer to other apples too.  \nRIGHT also avoids going too close to bottom edge early.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Long-term plan note:**  \n\nEnemy at top left, likely moving right along top edge. I should go for apples at (3, 0) then (8, 0) while staying clear of enemy path. Keep space, avoid trapping myself in corners.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Possible moves from (3, 1):**  \n- **UP** \u2192 (3, 2) \u2014 my own body segment. That\u2019s unsafe (moving into own body).  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 0) \u2014 apple there.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 1) \u2014 empty.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 1) \u2014 empty.  \n\nSo **UP is unsafe** (would die immediately).  \n\n---\n\n**2. Check enemy possible moves from (3, 9):**  \nEnemy\u2019s body at (2, 9). Their safe moves: UP (3, 10) off board \u2192 unsafe; DOWN (3, 8) safe; LEFT (2, 9) own body \u2192 unsafe; RIGHT (4, 9) safe.  \nSo enemy can go DOWN or RIGHT.  \nThey are far away (8 rows above me), so no immediate collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Safe moves for me:** DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Apple proximity:**  \n- Closest apple: (3, 0) directly below me. DOWN leads to eating it immediately.  \n- Other apples: (8, 0) distance from (3, 0) after eating = 5 horizontally. (9, 2) from (3, 0) = 6 horizontally + 2 vertically = 8.  \n- If I go LEFT or RIGHT, I miss the chance to eat (3, 0) this turn, and enemy could move closer.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Future options after each safe move:**  \n\n**DOWN to (3, 0)** (eat apple):  \nMy body becomes [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)] length 3. Next turn head at (3, 0), body at (3, 1) and (3, 2).  \nPossible next moves from (3, 0): UP (3, 1) own body \u2192 unsafe; DOWN off board \u2192 unsafe; LEFT (2, 0) empty; RIGHT (4, 0) empty.  \nSo only LEFT and RIGHT safe next turn \u2014 but that\u2019s okay because I\u2019ll be longer and can plan then.  \n\n**LEFT to (2, 1)**:  \nBody: [(2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)]. Next turn moves from (2, 1): UP (2, 2) empty, DOWN (2, 0) empty, LEFT (1, 1) empty, RIGHT (3, 1) own body \u2192 unsafe. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**RIGHT to (4, 1)**:  \nBody: [(4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2)]. Next turn from (4, 1): UP (4, 2) empty, DOWN (4, 0) empty, LEFT (3, 1) own body \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT (5, 1) empty. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Decision:**  \nEating (3, 0) now grows me to length 3, one apple ahead of enemy.  \nThe risk: after eating, I\u2019ll be in a corner (bottom row) with only 2 moves next turn, but that\u2019s manageable if I choose wisely.  \n\nMissing this apple means enemy could later get it or I\u2019d have to come back.  \n\nGiven the goal to collect apples and the low risk of enemy collision this turn, **DOWN** is best.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note:** After eating (3, 0) apple, move LEFT to (2, 0) or RIGHT to (4, 0) depending on which gives more future options and avoids trapping. From bottom row, try to move up soon to regain mobility.  \n\nDOWN",

Possible moves: UP \u2192 (5,10) off board \u2192 invalid; DOWN \u2192 (5,8); LEFT \u2192 (4,9) (its own body? No, body is [(4,9)] \u2014 yes that\u2019s its own body segment! Wait, enemy body is [(4,9)] only, so (4,9) is occupied by its own body, so moving LEFT into (4,9) kills it). RIGHT \u2192 (6,9). So enemy\u2019s safe moves: DOWN (5,8) and RIGHT (6,9).  \n\n**Check for head-on collisions:**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (5,0), enemy is at (5,9), can\u2019t reach (5,0) in 1 move.  \nIf I go UP to (4,1), enemy can\u2019t reach (4,1) in 1 move.  \nSo no immediate head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n**Which move is better for future options and apples?**  \nApples: closest apple to (4,0) is (8,0) at distance 4 horizontally, (8,3) distance 5, (9,2) distance 5+.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (5,0), distance to (8,0) becomes 3 horizontally.  \nIf I go UP to (4,1), distance to (8,0) is 4 horizontally + 1 vertically = 5.  \n\nBut (8,0) is reachable without immediate danger? Let\u2019s check:  \nFrom (5,0), next turn possible moves: UP (5,1), DOWN invalid (off board), LEFT (4,0) (occupied by my body now? Next turn body will be: new head at (5,0), old head (4,0) becomes body segment, old (3,0) stays, old (3,1) becomes tail? Wait, I didn\u2019t eat apple so length same: new body = [(5,0), (4,0), (3,0)], tail at (3,1) disappears. So (3,0) is body, (4,0) is body, so LEFT to (4,0) is into my own body \u2192 invalid. So from (5,0) only UP and RIGHT would be safe? Check RIGHT from (5,0) \u2192 (6,0) safe unless enemy moves there (impossible). So going RIGHT now gives fewer safe moves next turn (only UP, RIGHT safe; LEFT into body, DOWN off board).  \n\nFrom (4,1) next turn: possible moves UP (4,2), DOWN (4,0) (body? Next turn body = [(4,1), (4,0), (3,0)], so (4,0) is body \u2192 invalid), LEFT (3,1) (body? (3,1) is gone next turn? Wait: current body: head (4,0), (3,0), (3,1). If I move UP to (4,1), new body = [(4,1), (4,0), (3,0)], so (3,1) is gone, so LEFT to (3,1) is empty. So LEFT safe. RIGHT (5,1) safe. So from (4,1) next turn: UP, LEFT, RIGHT safe; DOWN invalid into body. So 3 safe moves.  \n\nMore future options from UP than from RIGHT.  \n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nI\u2019m short, enemy is far. Closest apple is (8,0). Move toward it while keeping flexibility. Avoid trapping myself near bottom edge. From (4,1), I can go toward (8,0) via (5,1) etc.  \n\n**Final move choice:** UP gives more options next turn, avoids bottom edge trap.  \n\nUP",

No \u2014 careful: My body is head at (8, 2) \u2192 move to (8, 3), body becomes [(8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2)] but apple at (8, 3) means I grow by 1, so new body length becomes 4: head at (8, 3), then (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2) plus new segment? Actually: when you eat apple, you grow by 1 segment at the end of tail next turn, but immediately after move head is at apple cell, body is old body shifted + new head, tail stays same length until next move? Wait, in Snake, after eating apple, you grow instantly by 1 segment added to tail, so length increases immediately. So my new body after UP move: head at (8, 3), then (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2) plus new segment at (6, 2)? That\u2019s wrong: tail end stays same until next move? Actually standard Snake: you move head forward, if apple eaten, you don\u2019t remove tail segment that turn, so length increases by 1. So after moving UP to (8, 3) and eating apple: head (8, 3), then (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2) \u2014 length 4. So (6, 2) still occupied next turn.  \n\nSo from (8, 3) next turn: possible moves:  \nUP (8, 4) empty, DOWN (8, 2) occupied by my body \u2192 unsafe, LEFT (7, 3) empty, RIGHT (9, 3) empty. So 3 safe moves.\n\nRIGHT to (9, 2):  \nEat apple (9, 2), body becomes [(9, 2), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2)]. Next turn from (9, 2):  \nUP (9, 3) empty, DOWN (9, 1) empty, LEFT (8, 2) occupied by my body \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT off board \u2192 unsafe. So only UP and DOWN safe next turn (2 safe moves). That\u2019s riskier.\n\nDOWN to (8, 1):  \nNo apple eaten, body shifts: head (8, 1), then (8, 2), (7, 2). Next turn from (8, 1):  \nUP (8, 2) my body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN (8, 0) apple (safe), LEFT (7, 1) empty, RIGHT (9, 1) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.\n\nSo UP and DOWN give 3 safe moves next turn, RIGHT gives only 2 safe moves.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Avoid enemy cut-off:**\n\nEnemy at (8, 6) could move DOWN to (8, 5) eating apple, then next turn could threaten (8, 4) if I go UP now.

However, I\u2019ll have more safe options next turn than if I go RIGHT to (9, 2) which corners me on right edge.\n\nGiven that UP and RIGHT both get an apple, but UP gives more future mobility, UP is better.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 3), consider avoiding (8, 2) body segment, maybe go UP to (8, 4) or LEFT/RIGHT to stay flexible.

Wait, apple list shows (8, 0), (1, 9), (9, 1), (8, 9), (9, 2) \u2014 oh, (8, 5) is not in apple list now. Actually apples: (9, 2), (8, 0), (1, 9), (9, 1), (8, 9). So (8, 5) is empty.  \n\nEnemy head at (8, 5) could go DOWN to (8, 4) (empty), LEFT to (7, 5) (empty), RIGHT to (9, 5) (empty).  \n\nClosest apples to enemy: (9, 2) distance 3, (8, 9) distance 4, (9, 1) distance 4, (8, 0) distance 5.  \nFrom (8, 5), DOWN to (8, 4) gets closer to (9, 2)? Not really, (9, 2) is at x=9, y=2; from (8, 4) distance = |9-8|+|2-4|=1+2=3, same as from (8, 5) distance=1+3=4? Wait compute: (8, 5) to (9, 2): dx=1, dy=3 \u2192 4. (8, 4) to (9, 2): dx=1, dy=2 \u2192 3. So yes, DOWN reduces distance to (9, 2). Also (9, 1) and (8, 0) are southward. So enemy likely DOWN.\n\nThus UP (8, 4) has high risk of head-on collision if enemy moves DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move:**\n\nUP to (8, 4):  \nIf no collision, next turn from (8, 4):  \nUP (8, 5) empty (enemy not there after move), DOWN (8, 3) my body (will be occupied if I move UP now? Let\u2019s track: current body: head (8, 3), then (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2). If I move UP to (8, 4), body becomes [(8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2)] (no apple eaten \u2192 tail (6, 2) removed). So (8, 3) occupied next turn. So DOWN from (8, 4) next turn unsafe. LEFT (7, 4) empty, RIGHT (9, 4) empty \u2192 3 safe moves next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\nLEFT to (7, 3):  \nNo apple eaten, body becomes [(7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2)] (tail (6, 2) removed). Next turn from (7, 3):  \nUP (7, 4) empty, DOWN (7, 2) my body (occupied) unsafe, LEFT (6, 3) empty, RIGHT (8, 3) my body (occupied) unsafe \u2192 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT).  \n\nRIGHT to (9, 3):  \nNo apple eaten, body becomes [(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2)] (tail (6, 2) removed). Next turn from (9, 3):  \nUP (9, 4) empty, DOWN (9, 2) apple (safe unless enemy?), LEFT (8, 3) my body unsafe, RIGHT off board unsafe \u2192 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN).\n\nSo UP gives 3 safe moves next turn (if no collision), LEFT gives 2, RIGHT gives 2.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity:**\n\nFrom (8, 3):  \nUP (8, 4): closest apple (9, 2) distance 3, (8, 9) distance 5.  \nLEFT (7, 3): closest apple (9, 2) distance 3, (8, 0) distance 4.  \nRIGHT (9, 3): closest apple (9, 2) distance 1, (9, 1) distance 2.\n\nRIGHT gets me very close to apple (9, 2).\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Risk vs reward:**\n\nUP: risk head-on collision if enemy DOWN (likely).  \nLEFT: safe from head-on collision, but fewer future moves (2 safe next turn).  \nRIGHT: safe from head-on collision, only 2 safe moves next turn but closer to apple (9, 2).\n\nGiven enemy likely DOWN to (8, 4), I should avoid UP. Between LEFT and RIGHT, RIGHT gets me closer to apple and DOWN from (9, 3) next turn leads to apple (9, 2), which is good. However, from (9, 3), moving DOWN to (9, 2) eats apple but then next turn after that: from (9, 2) only UP and DOWN safe (since left blocked by body), could be risky.\n\nLEFT (7, 3) gives less immediate apple benefit but more central position.\n\nI think avoiding collision is top priority. So UP is out. Between LEFT and RIGHT, RIGHT gives immediate apple proximity, which is valuable for score, but I must ensure I don\u2019t trap myself. Let\u2019s check: after RIGHT to (9, 3), next turn DOWN to (9, 2) eats apple, then body grows, then from (9, 2) only UP/DOWN safe, but UP to (9, 3) will be body, so actually only DOWN safe next-next turn? Wait: after (9, 3) \u2192 DOWN to (9, 2) eat apple, body becomes length 5: head (9, 2), then (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2). Then from (9, 2), UP (9, 3) body unsafe, DOWN (9, 1) empty, LEFT (8, 2) body unsafe, RIGHT off board unsafe \u2192 only DOWN safe. That\u2019s a dead end unless (9, 1) apple gives growth and opens new paths. But (9, 1) is apple, so eating it gives growth, then from (9, 1) only DOWN (9, 0) safe? Possibly tight but maybe manageable.\n\nLEFT (7, 3) \u2192 next turn from (7, 3) UP (7, 4) safe, LEFT (6, 3) safe, more options.\n\nSo LEFT is safer long-term.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision:**\n\nUP too risky (head-on collision possible).  \nRIGHT leads to reduced future options after eating apple.  \nLEFT safest for future flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 3), consider moving UP to (7, 4) or LEFT to (6, 3) to stay central and avoid trapping. Watch enemy movement toward (9, 2) apple; maybe let them take it while I collect others.\n\nLEFT",

Enemy snake #0 is far away on the left side of the board, so no collision concerns.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nEat the apple at (8, 9) to reach 4 apples.

Current state recap:**  \n- My snake (ID 0): head at (5,1), body at [(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)], length 4 (3 apples collected).  \n- Enemy snake #1: head at (8,8), body at [(8,7), (8,6), (9,6)], length 4.  \n- Apples: (9,2), (8,0), (1,9), (9,1), (8,9).  \n\n**2. Possible moves from my head (5,1):**  \n- **UP** \u2192 (5,2) \u2013 check: inside board, not my body? My body cells: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (5,2) is free. Enemy body cells: (8,7), (8,6), (9,6). No conflict.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5,0) \u2013 inside board, not my body, not enemy body.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4,1) \u2013 my own body segment (first body part after head). This would kill me.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,1) \u2013 inside board, not my body, not enemy body.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n**3. Enemy head movement prediction:**  \nEnemy head at (8,8). Possible moves for it: UP to (8,9) (apple there), DOWN to (8,7) (its own body), LEFT to (7,8) (empty), RIGHT to (9,8) (empty).  \nIf it goes UP to (8,9), it eats apple and grows; that\u2019s likely because (8,9) is empty and an apple. But I'm far away, so no direct collision risk this turn.  \n\n**4. Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples to me:  \n- (9,1) distance: |5-9| + |1-1| = 4  \n- (9,2) distance: |5-9| + |1-2| = 4+1=5  \n- (8,0) distance: |5-8| + |1-0| = 3+1=4  \n- (1,9) far.  \n\nRight now I'm at (5,1).  \n- UP to (5,2) gets me slightly closer to (9,2) but further from (9,1) and (8,0).  \n- DOWN to (5,0) gets me closer to (8,0) but further from others.  \n- RIGHT to (6,1) gets me closer to (9,1) and (9,2) and (8,0) in Manhattan terms.  \n\n**5. Future mobility:**  \nFrom (5,2): possible moves next turn: UP to (5,3), DOWN to (5,1) (but that\u2019s my old head position, which is now empty), LEFT to (4,2) (body now at (4,1),(4,2),(4,3) \u2014 wait, next turn after moving, body will shift: if I move UP, new body: head (5,2), then (5,1), (4,1), (4,2), tail (4,3) gone. So (4,2) will be free next turn? Let\u2019s check:  \nCurrent body: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). If I move UP: new body = [(5,2), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)]. So (4,2) is occupied next turn. So from (5,2), LEFT to (4,2) would be suicide next turn. That\u2019s a problem: reduces options.  \n\nFrom (5,0): next turn body = [(5,0), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)], so (4,0) free, (6,0) free, (5,1) occupied (body), (5,-1) invalid. So moves next turn: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN invalid, UP into own body. That\u2019s 2 safe moves.  \n\nFrom (6,1): next turn body = [(6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (4,2)], so (6,2), (6,0), (7,1) free, (5,1) occupied. That\u2019s 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**6. Collision risk with enemy:**  \nEnemy at (8,8) \u2014 nowhere near me this turn. No possible overlap given simultaneous movement.  \n\n**7. Decision:**  \nRIGHT gives best future mobility (3 options next turn) and moves me toward the cluster of apples at right side (9,1), (9,2), (8,0).  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove toward right-side apples while avoiding trapping myself. Keep an eye on enemy movement toward (8,9) apple \u2014 they may go down toward (8,0) apple next.  \n\nRIGHT",

This gives me more room to maneuver and multiple escape routes.\n- LEFT to (6, 8) moves me left, keeping me near the top but potentially limiting my options.\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see:\n- I'm currently on the top row (y=8)\n- Moving DOWN to (7, 7) gives me more flexibility for future moves and keeps me away from the board edge\n- From (7, 7), I can still access several apples while maintaining better positioning\n- Enemy snake #0 is at (8, 1) and might be targeting the apples at (9, 1) or (8, 0)\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove DOWN to (7, 7) to maintain flexibility and avoid the top edge. From there, I'll look to target the apples at (9, 2) or (9, 1) while keeping an eye on enemy snake #0's movements. I need to avoid getting cornered and maintain multiple escape routes.\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Let\u2019s break this down step by step.  \n\n**Current state:**  \n- My snake (ID 0): head at (8,1), body at [(7,1), (6,1), (5,1)].  \n- Apples: (9,2), (8,0), (1,9), (9,1), (0,0).  \n- Enemy snake #1: head at (7,8), body [(7,9), (8,9), (8,8), (8,7)].  \n- Board size: 10\u00d710, coordinates (0,0) to (9,9).  \n\n**Possible moves from (8,1):**  \n- UP \u2192 (8,2)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,0)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,1)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,1)  \n\n---\n\n### 1) Eliminate deadly moves  \n\n**UP (8,2):**  \n- Empty cell (from board state), not off board, not my body (body at (7,1),(6,1),(5,1)), not enemy body (enemy body at (7,9),(8,9),(8,8),(8,7),(7,8)? Wait, head at (7,8), body listed: (7,9),(8,9),(8,8),(8,7)). So (8,2) is clear.  \n- Could there be head-on collision? Enemy head at (7,8). Possible enemy moves: UP to (7,9) (occupied by its own body), DOWN to (7,7), LEFT to (6,8), RIGHT to (8,8) (occupied by its own body). So enemy cannot go UP or RIGHT (own body). It could go DOWN or LEFT.  \n(8,2) is far from enemy\u2019s possible moves (7,7) or (6,8). No head-on risk.  \nUP seems safe.  \n\n**DOWN (8,0):**  \n- Apple at (8,0). Not off board. Not my body. Not enemy body.  \n- But enemy could move DOWN to (7,7) etc., so no head-on risk.  \n- However: (8,0) is apple, so I\u2019d grow to length 5 next turn (head moves there, tail stays? Actually, if I eat apple, I grow, so tail doesn\u2019t move this turn). That\u2019s fine.  \n- Any immediate death? None.  \nDOWN is safe.  \n\n**LEFT (7,1):**  \n- Occupied by my own body segment (7,1) is second segment in my body. This would kill me instantly.  \nLEFT is **not safe**.  \n\n**RIGHT (9,1):**  \n- Apple at (9,1). Not off board. Not my body. Not enemy body.  \n- Enemy possible moves nowhere near (9,1).  \n- Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n### 2) Evaluate safe moves for strategy  \n\n**Apples nearby:**  \n- DOWN (8,0): apple  \n- RIGHT (9,1): apple  \n- UP (8,2): no apple now, but possibly closer to (9,2) next turn? Actually (9,2) is up-right from (8,2), so not directly closer unless I go right afterward.  \n\n**Future mobility after move:**  \n\nFrom (8,0) after eating apple: possible moves UP (back to 8,1), LEFT (7,0), RIGHT (9,0). One wall down, two open sides, one occupied by my body (8,1) if tail hasn\u2019t moved? Wait, tail is at (5,1) currently. If I eat apple at (8,0), my body becomes: head (8,0), then old head (8,1) becomes second segment, then (7,1), (6,1), (5,1) \u2014 tail stays at (5,1) until next move without apple. So (8,1) occupied next turn by my body. So from (8,0), UP blocked by my own body next turn. So mobility reduced.  \n\nFrom (9,1) after eating apple: body: head (9,1), old head (8,1) second, then (7,1),(6,1),(5,1). Possible moves next turn: UP (9,2) apple, DOWN (9,0), LEFT (8,1) (occupied by my body \u2014 blocked), RIGHT off board. So only UP or DOWN possible next turn \u2014 that\u2019s risky.  \n\nFrom (8,2) no apple: body: head (8,2), old head (8,1) second, then (7,1),(6,1),(5,1). Moves next turn: UP (8,3), DOWN (8,1) (own body), LEFT (7,2), RIGHT (9,2) apple. So three possible moves next turn, one leads to apple. Good mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy proximity:** enemy at (7,8) far away, no immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term:** I want to maximize survival and apple access.  \n\nRIGHT (9,1) leads to potential trap next turn (only two safe moves, one maybe off board).  \nDOWN (8,0) leads to limited moves next turn (UP blocked by own body).  \nUP (8,2) gives best mobility and sets up to get (9,2) apple next turn if desired.  \n\n---\n\n### 3) Final choice  \n\nUP keeps options open and is safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Short plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,2), consider going RIGHT to (9,2) apple if safe, else UP/LEFT to stay flexible. Avoid dead ends. Monitor enemy movement.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

Eliminate lethal moves:**  \nDOWN: into own body at (8, 2) \u2192 eliminated.  \nUP, LEFT, RIGHT seem *potentially* safe from immediate self-collision.  \n\nCheck board boundaries: all within 0\u20139 for x and y.  \n\nCheck enemy body positions:  \nEnemy body: (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9) \u2014 none at (8, 4), (7, 3), or (9, 3) currently.  \n\nBut must consider where enemy head might move this turn.  \n\nEnemy head at (8, 7), possible enemy moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (8, 8)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 6)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 7) \u2014 into its own body \u2192 lethal for them? Wait, (7, 7) is occupied by their own body segment. Yes, that\u2019s lethal for them, so they probably won\u2019t choose that unless they\u2019re suicidal.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 7)  \n\nSo likely enemy moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**2. Possible head-on collisions:**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 3), enemy cannot reach (9, 3) in one move from (8, 7) \u2192 safe from head-on.  \nIf I go LEFT to (7, 3), enemy cannot reach (7, 3) in one move \u2192 safe from head-on.  \nIf I go UP to (8, 4), enemy cannot reach (8, 4) in one move \u2192 safe from head-on.  \n\nSo no head-on collision risk this turn regardless.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Apple proximity:**  \nApples: (9, 2) is close to my RIGHT/DOWN area but DOWN is blocked.  \n(8, 0) far away.  \n(1, 9) far away.  \n(9, 1) close to my RIGHT/DOWN but blocked by my body at (8, 1) and (8, 2).  \n(0, 0) far away.  \n\nFrom (8, 3):  \n- UP (8, 4): moves away from nearest apple (9, 2) but opens board exploration.  \n- LEFT (7, 3): moves toward center, not directly toward any apple.  \n- RIGHT (9, 3): closer to apple at (9, 2) (one move DOWN next turn if safe).  \n\n---\n\n**4. Future mobility:**  \nCheck next turn options from each safe move:  \n\n- From (8, 4): possible moves UP (8,5), DOWN (8,3), LEFT (7,4), RIGHT (9,4). All likely safe unless enemy moves there.  \n- From (7, 3): UP (7,4), DOWN (7,2), LEFT (6,3), RIGHT (8,3).  \n- From (9, 3): UP (9,4), DOWN (9,2) \u2192 apple!, LEFT (8,3), RIGHT off board (10,3) invalid. So from (9,3), RIGHT is invalid, DOWN is apple but need to check safety next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Risk of trapping:**  \nGoing RIGHT to (9, 3) puts me on east edge, reduces future moves (RIGHT blocked). But apple at (9, 2) is tempting.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT now to (9, 3), next turn I could go DOWN to (9, 2) apple unless enemy moves there. But enemy head at (8, 7) now, could it reach (9, 2) in two moves? Not directly next turn, but maybe in two turns. Actually next turn enemy could move RIGHT to (9, 7), then DOWN five steps to (9, 2) \u2014 not next turn. So apple will likely stay.  \n\nBut going RIGHT now might be okay.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term safety:**  \nLEFT (7, 3) keeps me more central, more options later.  \nUP (8, 4) also safe.  \nBoth are fine.  \n\nGiven I have fewer apples than enemy (3 vs 4), maybe I should take slightly more aggressive apple-seeking but without unnecessary risk.  \n\nRIGHT to (9, 3) \u2192 next turn DOWN to (9, 2) apple is clear path if nothing changes. But need to ensure next turn DOWN from (9, 3) is safe:  \nNext turn my body will be: head to (9, 3), then old head (8, 3) becomes body segment 1, then (8, 2), then (8, 1), tail (7, 1) disappears if no apple eaten. So (9, 2) will be free unless enemy occupies it. Enemy at (8, 7) could move DOWN to (8, 6), then LEFT to (7, 6), etc., not reaching (9, 2) next turn. So likely safe to get apple next turn if I go RIGHT now.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go RIGHT now to (9, 3), next turn go DOWN to (9, 2) to get apple unless enemy head is adjacent to it then.  \n\nBut maybe safer to go UP or LEFT now to avoid being on edge.  \n\nActually, let\u2019s check: enemy head at (8, 7), body north and west of it. It will likely go UP to (8, 8) or RIGHT to (9, 7) to avoid hitting itself. Either way, not a threat to (9, 2) immediately.  \n\nI think RIGHT is acceptable.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nI\u2019ll go **RIGHT** to get closer to apple (9, 2) safely.  \n\n---\n\n**Short plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9, 3), take DOWN to (9, 2) apple if safe; else UP or LEFT to escape east edge. Avoid being trapped on right side after eating.  \n\nRIGHT",

No head-on collision possible this turn. Safe.\n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 off board (x=10) \u2192 death.\n\nSo **LEFT** is definitely safe. **UP** is safe if enemy doesn\u2019t move DOWN, but that\u2019s risky because enemy might choose DOWN to get away from top edge (since UP is into its own body at (9,7)).\n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**\n\n- **LEFT to (8,4)**:  \n  Opens up more central space, away from right edge.  \n  Next turn from (8,4): can go UP to (8,5), DOWN to (8,3) (my body at (8,3) now, but next turn body moves forward, so (8,3) might be free unless tail doesn\u2019t move), LEFT to (7,4), RIGHT to (9,4) (currently body at (9,3) moves away, so (9,4) free).

Yes.  \n   - In my body? No.  \n   - In enemy body? Check: enemy body cells are (9,6), (9,7), (8,7), (7,7) \u2192 not in those.  \n   - Possible head-on collision? Enemy at (9,5) could move UP to (9,6) (its own body), DOWN to (9,4) (my old head position, empty now), LEFT to (8,5) (collision if I go UP to same cell), RIGHT off board.  \n   - So if enemy moves LEFT to (8,5) and I move UP to (8,5), we collide \u2192 both die. Risky.\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (8,3)  \n   - Inside board? Yes.  \n   - In my body? Body is [(9,4), (9,3), (8,3)] \u2192 (8,3) is my own tail? Wait: tail is last segment (8,3), but next turn body moves forward, so (8,3) will be occupied by segment currently at (9,3) unless I eat an apple. I'm not eating an apple this turn, so body shifts: head moves, segment from (9,4) goes to (8,4)? Let's trace:  \n     Current: head(8,4), body segments: (9,4), (9,3), (8,3).  \n     If I move DOWN to (8,3), I'd be moving into my own body segment currently at (8,3) \u2192 immediate death. So DOWN is not safe.\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (7,4)  \n   - Inside board? Yes.  \n   - In my body? No.  \n   - In enemy body? No.  \n   - Possible head-on collision? Enemy at (9,5) can't reach (7,4) in one move \u2192 safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (9,4)  \n   - Inside board? Yes.  \n   - In my body? Body segments: (9,4), (9,3), (8,3) \u2192 (9,4) is my own body segment (right behind head currently) \u2192 moving into it kills me. Not safe.\n\nSo safe moves: **LEFT** definitely safe. **UP** possibly safe if enemy doesn't choose LEFT, but risky.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy likely move reasoning:**  \nEnemy head at (9,5). Its possible moves:  \n- UP to (9,6): occupied by its own body \u2192 death \u2192 unlikely if enemy is rational.  \n- DOWN to (9,4): empty after I move away, safe for enemy.  \n- LEFT to (8,5): safe.  \n- RIGHT off board \u2192 death.  \nSo enemy's only safe moves are DOWN or LEFT. If enemy chooses LEFT (8,5), and I go UP (8,5), we collide. If enemy chooses DOWN (9,4), no collision with my UP move.  \nBut I can't guarantee enemy won't choose LEFT, so UP is risky.\n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apples: (9,2) is below-left, (9,1) is below-right, (8,0) is far down-left.  \nFrom (8,4), moving LEFT to (7,4) gets me closer to central area, away from enemy on right edge, opens more options to go down later toward (8,0) or (9,2).  \n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n- LEFT to (7,4): next turn can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (all potentially free except maybe body positions after move).  \n- UP to (8,5): next turn from (8,5): UP to (8,6) (enemy body at (9,6)? Actually (8,6) free now), DOWN to (8,4) (my old head, now body at (8,4)? Wait, after move body shifts: new body will be [(8,4), (9,4), (9,3)], so (8,4) occupied next turn), LEFT to (7,5), RIGHT to (9,5) (enemy head possibly moved). Still okay but riskier due to enemy proximity.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nMove LEFT to central area, then head down toward apple (8,0) or (9,2). Avoid right edge where enemy is. Keep space open, don't box self in corners.\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Yes.  \n   - In my body? No.  \n   - In enemy body? Enemy body cells: (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (8,7) \u2192 (7,5) not in list.  \n   - Head-on collision risk? Enemy at (8,5) could move LEFT to (7,5). If I go UP to (7,5) and enemy goes LEFT to (7,5), we collide \u2192 both die. So risky.\n\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (7,3)**  \n   - Inside board? Yes.  \n   - In my body? No.  \n   - In enemy body? No.  \n   - Head-on collision? Enemy cannot reach (7,3) in one move from (8,5). Safe.\n\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (6,4)**  \n   - Inside board? Yes.  \n   - In my body? No.  \n   - In enemy body? No.  \n   - Head-on collision? Enemy cannot reach (6,4) in one move. Safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT \u2192 (8,4)**  \n   - Inside board? Yes.  \n   - In my body? Body: [(8,4), (9,4), (9,3)] \u2192 (8,4) is currently my own body segment right behind my head \u2192 moving into it kills me immediately. Not safe.\n\nSo safe moves: **DOWN** and **LEFT**. UP is risky due to possible head-on collision.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy\u2019s possible moves from (8,5):**  \n- UP to (8,6): empty, safe.  \n- DOWN to (8,4): my current body segment (behind my head) will shift; but enemy moving DOWN into (8,4) would collide with my body segment if I move away? Let\u2019s check: after I move, my body will be [(8,4), (9,4), (9,3)] if I don\u2019t eat an apple. So (8,4) will be occupied by my body. If enemy moves DOWN into (8,4), enemy dies (hits my body).  \n- LEFT to (7,5): safe (empty now).  \n- RIGHT to (9,5): enemy\u2019s own body (since body list is [(9,5), \u2026]) \u2192 so death.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP to (8,6) or LEFT to (7,5).  \n\nIf enemy chooses LEFT to (7,5) and I choose UP to (7,5), we collide. That\u2019s why UP is risky.\n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple: (9,2) is at bottom-right from (7,4). Moving DOWN to (7,3) gets me closer to (9,2) or (8,0) than moving LEFT to (6,4).  \nBut moving LEFT to (6,4) keeps me central and safe from enemy who is on right side.\n\n---\n\n**Future mobility after safe moves:**  \n- DOWN to (7,3): next turn from (7,3), possible moves: UP (back to 7,4 \u2014 occupied by my body next turn), DOWN to (7,2), LEFT to (6,3), RIGHT to (8,3) \u2014 (8,3) is currently empty but will be? Wait, after I move, my tail end at (9,3) will shift forward to (9,2)? No, I\u2019m not eating an apple, so my tail (last segment at (9,3)) disappears, body shifts: head to (7,3), segment at (8,4) \u2192 (7,4), segment at (9,4) \u2192 (8,4), segment at (9,3) \u2192 (9,4). So next turn, my body occupies: (7,4), (8,4), (9,4). So (8,3) free, (7,4) occupied, (9,4) occupied.  \n\nFrom (7,3), next turn:  \nUP to (7,4) \u2014 my body \u2192 no.  \nDOWN to (7,2) \u2014 free.  \nLEFT to (6,3) \u2014 free.  \nRIGHT to (8,3) \u2014 free.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn if I go DOWN now.\n\n- LEFT to (6,4): next turn from (6,4), body occupies (7,4), (8,4), (9,4).  \nPossible moves: UP to (6,5), DOWN to (6,3), LEFT to (5,4), RIGHT to (7,4) \u2014 my body \u2192 no.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn as well.\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT give good mobility.\n\n---\n\n**Risk avoidance:**  \nUP is risky due to enemy possibly moving LEFT to (7,5).  \nEnemy might choose UP to (8,6) instead, but I can\u2019t rely on that.  \n\nSafer to avoid UP entirely.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nMove toward apples while staying central. Enemy is longer (5 segments) and on right edge. Keep distance. Consider heading toward (8,0) or (9,2) after a couple moves. Avoid trapping myself near walls or enemy.\n\n---\n\nGiven all that, I\u2019ll choose **DOWN** to get closer to apples (9,2) and (8,0) while staying safe.\n\nDOWN",

Check each possible move from (7, 2) for immediate death  \n\n**UP \u2192 (7, 3)** \u2192 occupied by my own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n\n**DOWN \u2192 (7, 1)** \u2192 empty on board (checking: enemy body? No. My body? No. Wall? No, y=1 is valid). Safe.  \n\n**LEFT \u2192 (6, 2)** \u2192 empty. Safe.  \n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (8, 2)** \u2192 empty. Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Consider enemy\u2019s possible moves from (7, 6)  \n\nEnemy body: [(8, 6), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6)]  \nFrom (7, 6), possible enemy moves:  \n\n- UP \u2192 (7, 7) \u2192 empty, safe for them.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 5) \u2192 empty, safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 6) \u2192 empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 6) \u2192 occupied by their own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\nWhere might they go? They have apples at (1, 9) far away, and (9, 1), (9, 2), (8, 0), (0, 0) closer to me. They might move toward those apples too.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Head-on collision risk  \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 2), could enemy move to (8, 2)? No, enemy at (7, 6) cannot reach (8, 2) in one move.  \n\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 1), enemy cannot reach (7, 1) in one move.  \n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 2), enemy could move LEFT to (6, 6) \u2192 no collision.  \n\nSo no head-on collision risk this turn regardless of my safe move.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility after each move  \n\nFrom (7, 1): possible next moves UP (back to (7, 2)), LEFT (6, 1), RIGHT (8, 1), DOWN (7, 0). All four might be safe unless occupied next turn. Good mobility.  \n\nFrom (6, 2): possible next moves UP (6, 3), DOWN (6, 1), LEFT (5, 2), RIGHT (7, 2). Could be constrained if enemy moves nearby.  \n\nFrom (8, 2): possible next moves UP (8, 3), DOWN (8, 1), LEFT (7, 2), RIGHT (9, 2). Right leads to apple (9, 2), but then next turn after eating apple, growth might limit options.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Apple proximity  \n\nClosest apples to (7, 2):  \n- (9, 2): Manhattan distance 2 (right 2)  \n- (9, 1): Manhattan distance 3 (right 2, down 1)  \n- (8, 0): Manhattan distance 3 (right 1, down 2)  \n- (0, 0): far  \n- (1, 9): far  \n\nRIGHT gets me closer to (9, 2) and (9, 1).  \nDOWN gets me closer to (8, 0) and (9, 1) indirectly.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Enemy threat  \n\nEnemy is longer (5 segments vs my 4). If we get close, I risk being trapped. Currently enemy is at (7, 6), I\u2019m at (7, 2). Safer to move away from them while still pursuing apples. Moving DOWN or LEFT keeps distance. RIGHT also keeps distance (still 4 rows away vertically).  \n\n---\n\n### 7. Decision  \n\n- RIGHT: gets closest apple next turn if I go RIGHT again then DOWN/UP to (9, 2).  \n- DOWN: safe, good mobility, moves toward (8, 0) apple and possibly (9, 1).  \n- LEFT: moves away from most apples except (0, 0), which is far.  \n\nGiven enemy is north of me, moving DOWN puts me farther from them, which is safe. Moving RIGHT also fine, but apple at (9, 2) is near wall, could limit escape later.  \n\nI think **DOWN** is slightly safer for keeping options open and moving toward apple (8, 0) while staying clear of enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (7, 1), consider moving RIGHT toward (8, 0) apple or (9, 1), or continue DOWN to (7, 0) then right. Monitor enemy\u2019s movement\u2014they may come down toward apples too. Avoid getting pinned to bottom wall.  \n\nDOWN",

My body: (8,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3) \u2192 (9,2) not there.  \n   - In enemy body? Enemy: (6,5), (7,5), (7,6), (8,6) \u2192 no.  \n   - Apple? Yes, apple at (9, 2). Eating would grow to length 6 next turn.  \n   - Head-on collision risk? Enemy head at (5,5) cannot reach (9,2) in one move.  \n   - Safe? Yes.\n\n2. **DOWN \u2192 (9, 0)**  \n   - On board: yes.  \n   - In my body? No.  \n   - In enemy body? No.  \n   - Apple? Yes, apple at (9, 0). Eating would grow.  \n   - Head-on collision? Enemy too far.  \n   - Safe? Yes.\n\n3. **LEFT \u2192 (8, 1)**  \n   - On board: yes.  \n   - In my body? Yes \u2014 (8, 1) is my second segment (directly behind head). Moving backwards into own body \u2192 death.  \n   - Not safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT**  \n   - Off board (x = 10). Not allowed \u2192 death.\n\n---\n\n**Safe moves:** UP and DOWN.  \n\n**Analysis:**  \n\n- **UP (9, 2)** \u2014 eats apple, puts head at top-right corner. Next turn from (9, 2): possible moves LEFT (8, 2) or DOWN (9, 1) (but (9,1) will be empty because body moves forward; actually after growth, tail at (7,3) moves? Let\u2019s check growth: if I eat apple at turn 40, my body next turn will be head at (9,2), then old head (9,1) becomes new segment 2, then (8,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3) \u2014 so (9,1) occupied, so DOWN from (9,2) next turn would hit myself). So only LEFT from (9,2) safe next turn? Wait, DOWN would be (9,1) which is my own new body segment \u2192 death. So UP now leads to only LEFT next turn, potentially trapping if enemy approaches.  \n\n- **DOWN (9, 0)** \u2014 eats apple, puts head at bottom-right corner. Next turn from (9, 0): possible moves UP (9,1) (occupied by body next turn), LEFT (8,0) (apple? apple was at (8,0) still there unless eaten), but (8,0) might be safe. Actually after growth: body = [(9,1), (8,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)], so (9,1) occupied, UP not possible; LEFT to (8,0) safe if not enemy body; RIGHT off board; DOWN off board. So only LEFT next turn from (9,0). That\u2019s also a trap.  \n\nBoth UP and DOWN lead to only 1 safe move next turn (LEFT in both cases).  \n\nBut **UP (9,2)** \u2192 next turn LEFT to (8,2) is open now, and from there more options (UP/DOWN/LEFT).  \n**DOWN (9,0)** \u2192 next turn LEFT to (8,0) is open now, and from there more options (UP/DOWN/LEFT).  \n\nWhich is better?  \nEnemy is at (5,5) far away, not an immediate threat.  \nApple at (8,0) still exists \u2014 if I go DOWN now to (9,0), eat apple, then next turn LEFT to (8,0), I eat another apple immediately next turn. That\u2019s 2 apples in 2 turns.  \nIf I go UP now to (9,2), eat apple, next turn LEFT to (8,2) \u2014 no apple there, then I\u2019d need to go to (8,0) or elsewhere for next apple.  \n\nSo DOWN \u2192 LEFT sequence gets me 2 apples quickly.  \n\nRisk: after eating at (9,0) and growing, my body blocks (9,1), but enemy can\u2019t reach me before I move LEFT to (8,0). From (8,0) I\u2019ll have options.  \n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nAfter DOWN to (9,0), eat apple, next turn go LEFT to (8,0) to eat another apple, then from (8,0) go UP to (8,1) (but that\u2019s body segment \u2014 wait, by then body would have moved: turn 41 body = [(9,1),(8,1),(7,1),(7,2),(7,3)], so (8,1) occupied, so from (8,0) possible moves: UP to (8,1) no, LEFT to (7,0) yes, DOWN off board, RIGHT to (9,0) no. So only LEFT again. That\u2019s still a corridor. Hmm.  \n\nActually, maybe UP first is better because after (9,2) \u2192 (8,2) I have more space to maneuver toward center.  \n\nGiven the trap risk in bottom-right, I\u2019ll choose **UP** now for more future flexibility after eating the apple at (9,2).  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP",

It\u2019s far away (7 columns away), so no immediate collision risk with me except possibly if we both move into same cell next turn \u2014 not possible here because enemy can\u2019t reach my possible head positions in one move.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apples: (8,0) and (9,0) are near me.  \nFrom (7,1):  \n- DOWN to (7,0) \u2192 next turn could go RIGHT to (8,0) (apple) or LEFT to (6,0) etc.  \n- LEFT to (6,1) \u2192 moves away from closest apples  \n- RIGHT to (8,1) \u2192 closer to (8,0) and (9,0), but not directly onto apple yet.  \n\n**Future mobility from each safe move:**  \nFrom (7,0): next moves: UP back to (7,1) (body after I move?), LEFT (6,0), RIGHT (8,0) apple.  \nFrom (8,1): next moves: UP (8,2) free, DOWN (8,0) apple, LEFT (7,1) body? Let\u2019s check: If I move RIGHT to (8,1), my body will be at [(7,1), (7,2), \u2026]. So (7,1) will be my neck, so moving LEFT next turn from (8,1) would go back into (7,1) \u2014 which is my body segment (the old head position) \u2014 so that would be suicide next turn unless I eat apple and grow? Wait, if I don\u2019t eat apple, my tail moves: tail is (9,2) \u2192 will move to (9,3)? Actually, snake movement: head moves to new cell, each segment moves into previous segment\u2019s position. So after moving RIGHT to (8,1), body becomes: head (8,1), then (7,1) (old head), then (7,2), (7,3), (8,3), tail (9,3) \u2014 wait, that\u2019s wrong, let\u2019s trace carefully:  \n\nCurrent body: head (7,1), then B1=(7,2), B2=(7,3), B3=(8,3), B4=(9,3), tail=(9,2).  \nIf head moves to (8,1):  \nNew body: head (8,1), then (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,3), (9,3) \u2014 tail (9,2) disappears.  \nSo (7,1) is now my body segment. So next turn from (8,1), moving LEFT to (7,1) would be suicide.  \n\nSimilarly, from (7,0) after moving DOWN:  \nNew body: head (7,0), then (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,3), (9,3) \u2014 tail (9,2) gone.  \nSo from (7,0), moving UP to (7,1) next turn would be suicide unless I eat apple.  \n\nBut if I eat apple, I grow, so tail doesn\u2019t move, so (7,1) remains body after growth.  \n\nSo both DOWN and RIGHT leave one direction that\u2019s suicidal next turn unless I eat apple.  \n\nWhich is safer?  \n\nRIGHT to (8,1): Next turn moves: UP (8,2) free, DOWN (8,0) apple, LEFT (7,1) body \u2192 deadly unless apple eaten. So if I go RIGHT now, next turn I must go DOWN to (8,0) apple to avoid having only one safe move. That\u2019s okay \u2014 apple at (8,0) is safe? Let\u2019s check: Next turn from (8,1) to (8,0) apple: enemy far away, no conflict.  \n\nDOWN to (7,0): Next turn moves: LEFT (6,0) free, RIGHT (8,0) apple, UP (7,1) body \u2192 deadly unless apple eaten. So again, next turn I should aim for apple at (8,0) via RIGHT from (7,0).  \n\nSo both DOWN and RIGHT require going to (8,0) next turn to avoid trap.  \n\nWhich path to (8,0) is safer?  \nOption A: (7,1) \u2192 RIGHT (8,1) \u2192 DOWN (8,0)  \nOption B: (7,1) \u2192 DOWN (7,0) \u2192 RIGHT (8,0)  \n\nCheck intermediate cell safety:  \nOption A intermediate (8,1) \u2014 is it safe? Yes, currently free, enemy far.  \nOption B intermediate (7,0) \u2014 safe, yes.  \n\nBut from (8,1) to (8,0), I must check if (8,0) could be taken by enemy next turn \u2014 enemy at (0,4) can\u2019t reach (8,0) in 2 moves? Actually 2 moves: (0,4) \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 (2,4) \u2026 no, too far. So safe.  \n\nWhat about LEFT to (6,1)? That gives more options next turn? From (6,1), next moves: UP (6,2) free, DOWN (6,0) free, RIGHT (7,1) body (deadly unless apple eaten), LEFT (5,1) free. That\u2019s 3 safe moves if no apple eaten. But moves me away from apples.  \n\nGiven I want apples to win (I have 5, enemy has 4), staying near apples is good.  \n\nI think RIGHT to (8,1) is slightly better than DOWN because:  \n- It positions me closer to both (8,0) and (9,0) apples.  \n- Next turn DOWN to (8,0) gets apple and avoids trap.  \n- After eating apple at (8,0), I\u2019ll have 6 apples, body grows, more space to maneuver.  \n\nLEFT is safe but delays apple collection.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,1), go DOWN to (8,0) to eat apple, unless enemy somehow threatens (8,0) \u2014 but they don\u2019t.  \n\nSo final choice:  \n\nRIGHT",

If I move here, I eat apple and grow by 1 segment.  \nEnemy can\u2019t reach (8,0) in 1 move. Safe from immediate enemy head collision.  \nNo self-collision (my body currently at (7,1), (7,2), etc., not (8,0)).  \n\n**RIGHT (9,1):**  \nBoard empty at (9,1).  \nEnemy can\u2019t reach it in 1 move. Safe.\n\n---\n\n**Consider enemy possible moves and future safety:**  \nEnemy head at (0,3) could go DOWN to (0,2) or RIGHT to (1,3). They\u2019re far away, no immediate threat to my possible head positions this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Growth and path planning:**  \nIf I eat apple at (8,0):  \n- I grow to length 7 (currently length 6: head + 5 body segments, after eating apple tail doesn\u2019t move, so new length = 7).  \n- After eating, my body will be: head (8,0), then (8,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,3), (9,3) \u2014 tail stays at (9,3).  \n\nIf I don\u2019t eat apple now:  \nMy tail (9,3) will move to (8,3)? Wait, trace movement:  \nCurrent body: head (8,1), then (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,3), (9,3) \u2014 tail is (9,3).  \nIf I move without eating, head moves to new cell, each segment shifts, tail disappears. So new body: head (new), then (8,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,3). So tail (9,3) gone.  \n\n---\n\n**Future mobility after each move:**  \n\n**DOWN to (8,0) apple:**  \nNext turn from (8,0): possible moves UP (8,1) (my body after growth), LEFT (7,0) free, RIGHT (9,0) apple. So only 2 safe moves if UP is blocked. But eating apple means I grow, so (8,1) is my body next turn, so UP is deadly. So next turn from (8,0) only LEFT and RIGHT safe. But RIGHT leads to apple (9,0).\n\n**UP to (8,2):**  \nNext turn from (8,2): possible moves UP (8,3) my body? Wait, after moving UP to (8,2) without eating: body becomes head (8,2), then (8,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,3). So (8,3) is my body, so UP from (8,2) next turn is deadly. DOWN to (8,1) my body, deadly. LEFT (7,2) my body, deadly. RIGHT (9,2) free. So only 1 safe move next turn \u2014 risky.  \n\n**RIGHT to (9,1):**  \nNext turn from (9,1): body after move: head (9,1), then (8,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,3). So possible moves: UP (9,2) free, DOWN (9,0) apple, LEFT (8,1) my body (deadly). So 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN), DOWN leads to apple.\n\n---\n\n**Compare:**  \n- UP (8,2) \u2192 next turn only RIGHT safe \u2192 dead end if no apple eaten.  \n- RIGHT (9,1) \u2192 next turn UP/DOWN safe, DOWN to apple.  \n- DOWN (8,0) apple \u2192 next turn LEFT/RIGHT safe, RIGHT to apple (9,0).  \n\nEating apple now is beneficial because:  \n1. Increases my score to 6 vs enemy\u2019s 4.  \n2. Opens possibility to eat (9,0) next turn.  \n3. Avoids risky single-move future.\n\n---\n\n**Check head-on collision possibility:**  \nEnemy could move to (1,3) or (0,2). My DOWN to (8,0) is far from them, no conflict.  \nRIGHT to (9,1) also safe. UP also safe.\n\nBut UP is bad for future mobility.\n\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT:  \nDOWN gets apple now, locks me into 2 moves next turn but one leads to another apple.  \nRIGHT delays apple but keeps options open slightly more? Actually RIGHT next turn DOWN gets apple anyway, so same number of apples in 2 turns possibly.  \n\nBut eating earlier is better \u2014 less risk of enemy grabbing (8,0) later (though they\u2019re far now).  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nAfter eating (8,0), go to (9,0) next turn for another apple if safe. That brings score to 7. Enemy at 4, so gap widens. Keep away from enemy, avoid boxing self in corners.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN to eat apple safely and increase lead.\n\nDOWN",

Yes, length 8 now.  \n\nSo moving UP to (9,1) will not eat an apple (no apple there), tail (9,3) will drop off? Actually tail is (9,3), moving to (9,1) shifts body, tail disappears, length stays 8? No \u2014 if no apple eaten, length stays same, so tail moves forward? Let\u2019s clarify: Snake movement: head moves to new cell, each segment moves into previous segment\u2019s position, last segment (tail) vacates its cell unless apple eaten. So after UP without apple: head (9,1), then (9,0), (8,0), (8,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,3) \u2014 tail (9,3) gone, length still 8.  \n\n---\n\n**Future options after UP:**  \nFrom (9,1) next turn:  \n- UP to (9,2): empty.  \n- DOWN to (9,0): my body (second segment) \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT to (8,1): my body (fourth segment) \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT off board.  \n\nSo only UP to (9,2) safe next turn. That means two turns in a row with only one safe move \u2014 risky but maybe unavoidable.  \n\n---\n\n**Alternative?** I only have one safe move now anyway (UP). So I must go UP.  \n\n---\n\n**Check enemy\u2019s likely move:**  \nEnemy might go DOWN to (0,0) to eat apple, or RIGHT to (1,1) for mobility. Either way, not affecting me immediately.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019m stuck along right edge with only UP moves possible for now. After (9,2), from (9,2) check: UP (9,3) my body then? Let\u2019s trace: after moving to (9,1), body: (9,0), (8,0), (8,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,3). (9,3) is gone. So at (9,2), UP to (9,3) will be free next turn? Yes, (9,3) will be empty after this turn. So path upward along column 9 seems possible until near top. Then I\u2019ll need to turn left toward apples eventually.  \n\nPlan: Go UP now, next turn UP again to (9,2), then UP to (9,3), then maybe LEFT toward apples (1,9), (4,9), (4,7), (1,7) while avoiding trapping myself.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",
