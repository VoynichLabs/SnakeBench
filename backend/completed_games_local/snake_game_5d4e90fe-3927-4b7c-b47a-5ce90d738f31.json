Length 1.\n\nI need to choose a move (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) that is safe and ideally moves towards an apple.\n\n**1. Analyze Potential Moves (My Head at (5, 0))**\n\n**A. Move UP (New Head: (5, 1))**\n*   **Board Bounds:** Safe (Y=1 is within [0, 9]).\n*   **Self Collision:** Safe. My body is empty. Moving backward would be to (5,-1) if my tail was there, but it's not. (5, 1) is not my current location or any future body location.\n*   **Enemy Collision:** Enemy head is at (3, 5). They move simultaneously.\n    *   If Enemy moves UP to (3, 6). Safe.\n    *   If Enemy moves DOWN to (3, 4). Safe.\n    *   If Enemy moves LEFT to (2, 5). Safe.\n    *   If Enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 5). Safe.\n    *   No immediate collision at (5, 1).\n*   **Apple Proximity:** Moving towards (5, 5) (distance 5) or (9, 4) (distance 5) or (2, 7) (distance 7). (5, 5) is the closest apple directly above me.\n\n**B. Move DOWN (New Head: (5, -1))**\n*   **Board Bounds:** **Unsafe.** Y=-1 is off the board.\n\n**C. Move LEFT (New Head: (4, 0))**\n*   **Board Bounds:** Safe (X=4 is within [0, 9]).\n*   **Self Collision:** Safe.\n*   **Enemy Collision:** Safe, as determined above.\n*   **Apple Proximity:** Moving closer to (1, 0) (distance 3).\n\n**D. Move RIGHT (New Head: (6, 0))**\n*   **Board Bounds:** Safe (X=6 is within [0, 9]).\n*   **Self Collision:** Safe.\n*   **Enemy Collision:** Safe, as determined above.\n*   **Apple Proximity:** Similar distance to Left/Up moves relative to nearby apples.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves (A: UP, C: LEFT, D: RIGHT)**\n\nI have three safe options: (5, 1) UP, (4, 0) LEFT, (6, 0) RIGHT.\n\n*   **Target Apple (1, 0):** Closest to (5, 0) along the X-axis. Moving LEFT (4, 0) takes me one step closer to (1, 0) (from distance 4 to 3).\n*   **Target Apple (5, 5):** Moving UP (5, 1) takes me one step closer to (5, 5) (from distance 5 to 4).\n\nBoth UP and LEFT make progress towards the nearest apples.\n\n*   **Considering Enemy E1 at (3, 5):**\n    *   If I go UP to (5, 1), the enemy can potentially move toward (5, 5) or (1, 0) as well. If E1 moves towards (5, 5), say RIGHT to (4, 5), they are closing in on the same apple cluster.\n    *   If I go LEFT to (4, 0), I move towards the bottom-left corner apple (1, 0). E1 is far away in the middle-top.\n\nMoving towards the closest apple cluster (1, 0) seems strategically sound, especially since it keeps me low on the board, potentially allowing more manoeuvrability later compared to moving towards the top edge where (8, 9) and (2, 7) reside. Moving LEFT puts me at (4, 0). The nearest apple is 3 steps away at (1, 0).\n\nIf I move UP to (5, 1), the nearest apple (5, 5) is 4 steps away.\n\nGiven that (1, 0) is spatially closer (distance 4 vs distance 5 to (5, 5)), moving LEFT to get closer to (1, 0) seems slightly favored for immediate apple acquisition efficiency.\n\n**Strategy Decision:** Move LEFT towards apple (1, 0).\n\nShort-term plan: Move Left towards (1, 0). If successful, the next move will likely be LEFT again or UP, depending on the board state and if the enemy snake moves predictably towards any apple cluster.\n\nLong-term plan: Secure the closest, lowest apple at (1, 0) first, as it minimizes travel time currently. Avoid moving to the corners (0 or 9 edges) prematurely as this restricts movement options.\n\n**Next Move Selection:** LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

Wait, the enemy move wasn't recorded in the previous turn's output. I must assume the board state reflects the result of simultaneous moves from Turn 1.)\n\n**Crucially, I need to infer the enemy's move from the change in their position:**\nTurn 1: My Head (5, 0). Enemy Head (4, 5).\nMy Move: LEFT -> New Head (4, 0).\nEnemy Move: Unknown, but their resulting position is (4, 5).\nIf the enemy was at (4, 5) at the start of Turn 1, and they are at (4, 5) at the start of Turn 2, they must have moved into a cell that resulted in them being back at (4, 5), OR the board state provided is the result *after* both moves happened simultaneously.\n\nLet's re-examine the state transition:\nStart T1: Me (5, 0), E1 (4, 5).\nI chose LEFT, leading to Head (4, 0).\nThe provided board state shows: Me 0 at (4, 0), E1 at (4, 5).\nThis means E1's move must have resulted in them ending up at (4, 5). Since E1 started at (4, 5), they must have chosen a movement that placed them back exactly where they started. This is only possible if their starting position was NOT (4, 5) in the previous turn.\n\nLet's look at the board state provided for Turn 2:\nMy Head: (4, 0).\nEnemy Head #1: (4, 5).\n\nLet's reconstruct Turn 1 based on my move (LEFT) and the resulting board state:\nIf my move was LEFT from (5, 0) to (4, 0), and E1 ended at (4, 5), I need to know where E1 started.\nThe previous turn output stated: \"Enemy snake (ID 1) is at (3, 5).\" (This was in my analysis of Turn 1, but it was based on the initial analysis where I mistakenly used (3,5) instead of the actual initial position from the board state which showed E1 at (4, 5)!)\n\nLet's use the provided board states strictly:\nTurn 1 Initial state: Me (4, 0) -> Wait, no.\nTurn 1 Start: Me (5, 0), E1 (4, 5).\nTurn 1 End (Start T2): Me (4, 0), E1 (4, 5). (Assuming the body lists were empty, snake length 1).\n\nIf E1 started at (4, 5) and ended at (4, 5), they moved:\n1. UP to (4, 6), then DOWN to (4, 5) - Impossible in one turn.\n2. They stayed put? Snake games don't allow staying put unless all moves are blocked.\n3. They moved and immediately returned, which implies they hit something and died, OR the opponent *also* moved into them causing a collision, OR they moved into a cell (X, Y) and the simultaneous move led them back (impossible).\n\n**Assumption based on standard simultaneous move interpretation:**\nIf E1 is at (4, 5) in the new state, they moved from an initial position $P_{start}$ to (4, 5), resulting from E1's move $M_E$.\nIf the provided board for Turn 2 shows E1 at (4, 5), and my analysis for Turn 1 was based on E1 being at (4, 5), this implies E1 did not move relative to the initial T1 board state provided in the *previous* step's setup, or they moved and returned.\n\n**Let's trust the current board state provided for Turn 2:**\nMy Head: (4, 0).\nE1 Head: (4, 5).\nApples: (2, 7), (9, 4), (5, 5), (1, 0), (8, 9).\n\n**My current position (4, 0). Target Apple: (1, 0). Distance 3.**\n**Enemy position (4, 5). Target Apples: (5, 5) nearby, or (2, 7).**\n\n**1. Analyze Potential Moves (My Head at (4, 0))**\n\n**A. Move UP (New Head: (4, 1))**\n*   Bounds: Safe.\n*   Self Collision: Safe.\n*   Enemy Collision (E1 at (4, 5)): E1 moves simultaneously.\n    *   If E1 moves UP to (4, 6). Safe.\n    *   If E1 moves DOWN to (4, 4). Safe.\n    *   If E1 moves LEFT to (3, 5). Safe.\n    *   If E1 moves RIGHT to (5, 5). That's the apple. Safe for now.\n    *   No immediate collision at (4, 1).\n\n**B. Move DOWN (New Head: (4, -1))**\n*   Bounds: **Unsafe.** Off the board.\n\n**C. Move LEFT (New Head: (3, 0))**\n*   Bounds: Safe.\n*   Self Collision: Safe.\n*   Apple Proximity: Moves closer to (1, 0) (Distance 2).\n*   Enemy Collision: Safe, as determined above.\n\n**D. Move RIGHT (New Head: (5, 0))**\n*   Bounds: Safe.\n*   Self Collision: Safe.\n*   Apple Proximity: Moves away from (1, 0). Moves slightly closer to (5, 5) (Distance 5 to 5, 1 step closer in Y).\n*   Enemy Collision: Safe, as determined above.\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves (A: UP, C: LEFT, D: RIGHT)**\n\nThe main target remains (1, 0).\n*   Move LEFT: Reaches (3, 0). Distance to (1, 0) becomes 2. This is optimal progress towards the nearest apple in the current direction of pursuit.\n*   Move UP: Reaches (4, 1). Distance to (1, 0) is $\\sqrt{3^2 + 1^2} \\approx 3.16$. Worse progress towards (1, 0).\n*   Move RIGHT: Reaches (5, 0). Distance to (1, 0) is 4. Worse progress towards (1, 0).\n\nMoving LEFT puts me on course to grab (1, 0) in 2 more steps if the path remains clear. This is the most direct route based on current apple location. The enemy E1 is too far away (5 units vertically) to interfere with this movement in the short term.\n\n**Strategy Update:** Continue pushing towards the lowest apple (1, 0) via LEFT moves, as the horizontal path is clear and efficient.\n\n**Next Move Selection:** LEFT.\n\nLONG TERM PLAN: Continue moving LEFT towards (1, 0). Once (1, 0) is eaten, re-evaluate based on apple (2, 7), (5, 5), (9, 4) positions. Maintain awareness of E1, who seems focused near the center/top. Keep paths open for quick turns if necessary.\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Length 1.\n\nBoard State for Turn 2 (provided immediately after T2 score summary):\nE1 is marked 'T 1' on the board image, located at (4, 5).\nThe text description says: Head: (5, 5), Body: [(4, 5)].\n**There is a mismatch between the provided textual description of E1's location/body and the board visualization.**\n\nBoard visualization @ (4, 5) shows 'T 1'. If T 1 means Snake 1, its head is at (4, 5)?\nIf Board is: Head @ (4, 5), Tail @ (X, Y)?\n\nIf I trust the textual data more:\nE1 Head: (5, 5). E1 Body segment: (4, 5). Length 2.\nIf I trust the visual map marker \"T 1\" at (4, 5): E1 Head is at (4, 5). Length 1 or 2?\n\nGiven the previous turn's score summary showed:\nTurn 1 End (Start T2): E1 at (4, 5), Body: none. (Length 1).\nSince E1 has 1 apple, they must have grown to length 2 *before* the moves of Turn 2 were calculated, or the body list is incomplete/misleading in the T2 input block provided for context.\n\nLet's prioritize the data given for the *current* Turn 3 evaluation, which explicitly states:\nE1 Head: (5, 5), Body: [(4, 5)]. (Length 2).\n\nIf E1 Head is (5, 5) and Body is [(4, 5)]:\nThe snake occupies (5, 5) and (4, 5).\nThe apple at (5, 5) is eaten by E1, explaining their score of 1.\n\nOkay, reconciling coordinates for Turn 3 calculation:\nMy Head: (4, 0).\nE1 Head: (5, 5). E1 Body: (4, 5). E1 occupies (5, 5) and (4, 5).\nTarget Apple: (1, 0) (Distance 3).\n\n**1. Analyze Potential Moves (My Head at (4, 0))**\n\n**A. Move UP (New Head: (4, 1))**\n*   Safe from self.\n*   Enemy Check: E1 Head (5, 5). E1 Body (4, 5).\n    *   E1 moves simultaneously. E1 needs an escape route from (5, 5) or stay put/move towards me.\n    *   If E1 moves LEFT to (4, 5) -> Collision with E1's own body segment (4, 5). E1 dies unless the move is simultaneous collision avoidance based? Usually, moving into your own body segment means death. If E1 moves LEFT, they move onto where their body segment (4, 5) is located. E1 dies?\n    *   If E1 moves DOWN to (5, 4). Safe for me.\n    *   If E1 moves UP to (5, 6). Safe for me.\n    *   If E1 moves RIGHT to (6, 5). Safe for me.\n    *   If E1 moves LEFT to (4, 5) [Body]: This is a lethal move for E1 if it results in instant collision detection, *or* if E1's move results in the head moving onto the tail just vacated by the body segment movement (like I move backwards). Since (4, 5) is E1's body, moving there is death for E1.\n\n**B. Move DOWN (New Head: (4, -1))**\n*   Unsafe (Off board).\n\n**C. Move LEFT (New Head: (3, 0))**\n*   Safe from self.\n*   Enemy Check: E1 Head (5, 5).\n    *   If E1 moves LEFT to (4, 5) [Body]: E1 dies. Safe for me.\n    *   If E1 moves RIGHT to (6, 5). Safe for me.\n    *   If E1 moves UP to (5, 6). Safe for me.\n    *   If E1 moves DOWN to (5, 4). Safe for me.\n\n**D. Move RIGHT (New Head: (5, 0))**\n*   Safe from self.\n*   Enemy Check: E1 Head (5, 5).\n    *   E1 moving LEFT results in E1 dying at (4, 5). Safe for me.\n\n**Collision Analysis Summary (E1 Behavior):**\nThe enemy E1 at (5, 5) with body at (4, 5) must move. If E1 moves LEFT to (4, 5), E1 dies due to self-collision.\nIf E1 moves UP, DOWN, or RIGHT, E1 survives.\nSince we cannot rely on the enemy killing itself, we must assume E1 makes a strategic move (UP, DOWN, or RIGHT) or a random move that keeps it alive.\n\nIf E1 moves UP (5, 6): My options UP (4, 1), LEFT (3, 0), RIGHT (5, 0) are all safe relative to E1's known *possible* future locations.\nIf E1 moves DOWN (5, 4): My options UP (4, 1), LEFT (3, 0), RIGHT (5, 0) are all safe relative to E1's known *possible* future locations.\nIf E1 moves RIGHT (6, 5): My options UP (4, 1), LEFT (3, 0), RIGHT (5, 0) are all safe relative to E1's known *possible* future locations.\n\n**2. Re-evaluate Target (1, 0)**\nThe move LEFT (to (3, 0)) remains the most direct path towards (1, 0). It is safe regardless of E1's non-self-destructive move.\n\nMy last rationale already selected LEFT based on prior board state. Since the new board state does not introduce any immediate fatal threat to the LEFT move, and LEFT continues the optimal path towards the nearest apple (1, 0), I select LEFT again.\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Continue pursuing the nearest apple (1, 0) by moving leftwards along the bottom edge. Maintain awareness of E1, who is currently high up and slightly to the right. If E1 moves towards me, I will prioritize safety over speed to the apple.\n\nLEFT",

However, the input for Turn 4 does not explicitly state if Snake 1 made a move or died. I must rely on the implied board state update from the provided Turn 4 data structure, which *should* reflect the outcome of the previous turn's moves.\n\nThe provided input structure for Turn 4 is unusual because it repeats the format of previous turns but doesn't show what E1 did, nor does it refresh my head position based on my last move (LEFT). **I must infer my current position based on my last chosen move (LEFT) from the Turn 3 analysis**, and then attempt to deduce E1's move based on the new environment (if provided).\n\n**Re-evaluating My Position (My Move: LEFT):**\nStart T3 Head: (4, 0).\nMove LEFT -> New Head: (3, 0).

E1 had the option to move LEFT and die, or move U/D/R and live.\nSince the T4 preamble does not contain 'Enemy snakes:' section detailing E1's new location (unlike the T3 or T2 blocks), I must look at the new board state provided for T4 to deduce E1's outcome.\n\nBoard state (T4):\n 9 . . . . . . . .

Since no marker '1' is visible on the board, this strongly suggests **Snake #1 (ID 1) has died or an apple was eaten and the representation is missing**.\n\nIf E1 died:\n1. E1 moved LEFT and collided with (4, 5) -> E1 Dies.\n2. E1 moved towards me (if I was near Y=0) and caused a collision -> Unlikely, I was at (4, 0) and moved to (3, 0). E1 was at (5, 5). No head-on collision possible this turn.\n3. E1 moved onto my body -> I had no body.\n\nThe most likely outcome, given the lack of any marker '1' on the map, is **Snake #1 died by moving into its own body segment (4, 5) by choosing LEFT.**\n\nAssuming Snake #1 died: I win immediately as I am the only living snake. The game ends.\n\nIf the game ends now (because I am the only survivor), I check points. I have 0 apples. Snake #1 had 1 apple. If the game ends on the win condition \"If at any point all opponents are dead and you are alive, you immediately win,\" this rule supersedes the apple counting unless the death occurred on the final turn (T150). Since T=4, I win now.\n\nI must still submit a move according to the prompt structure, even if the game logically ends. If I must submit a move, I aim for the nearest apple (1, 0) since there are no remaining threats.\n\n**Target: (1, 0). Current Head: (3, 0).**\n1. Move LEFT: (2, 0). Lands on Apple (1, 0)? No, (2, 0) is adjacent to it.\n2. Move LEFT again gets me to (1, 0) next turn.\n\n**Move Analysis (Assuming Win Condition is Not Triggered Yet, or Requires Explicit Move Selection):**\n\nSince I am now alone, safety is not a concern. I rush the closest apple (1, 0).\nHead (3, 0).\nMove LEFT -> Head (2, 0).

However, if the automated system requires a move selection for Turn 4, I select the move that maximizes my current score potential, which is LEFT towards (1, 0).\n\nI will proceed with the move LEFT, aiming for the apple at (1, 0) on the next turn.\n\nLong Term Plan: Secure (1, 0) next turn. Then proceed to (2, 7) or (7, 0) depending on relative distance/pathing ease.\n\nLEFT",

However, if the game structure forces me through 150 turns until an apple count win, or if my assumption about Snake 1's death was based on incomplete information (e.g., Snake 1 died but the board update logic didn't recognize the win condition), I must proceed carefully.\n\nLet's look at the implied T4 update based on my move (LEFT) from T3 Head (3, 0) -> T4 Head (2, 0).\nMy T3 Head was (3, 0). Body was empty.\nIf I moved LEFT to (2, 0), and I have 1 apple collected prior to T4 (as per T3 structure), my body should now include the segment I left behind, (3, 0).\n\nIf I ate an apple at T3:\nT3 Head: (3, 0). Apples collected: 0.\nT4 Move: LEFT -> New Head: (2, 0).\nIf I hit an apple at (2, 0) at T4, I grow.\n\nWait, the input structure for T4 shows:\nYour snake (ID: 0) apples: 1 (This is the score *before* T4 move processing).\nIf my score was 1 *before* T4, that apple must have been collected at T3.\nT3 Input:\nHead: (3, 0). Body: none. Apples collected: 0. (This contradicts the T4 Preamble score count).\n\n**I MUST rely strictly on the provided T4 data structure, which represents the state *after* my T3 move and *before* my T4 move.**\n\nT4 State Analysis (Start of Turn 4):\nScore: S0=1, S1=1.\nS0 Head: (1, 0). Body: [(2, 0)]. (This means I moved to (1, 0) at T3, growing to length 2, and my previous head (2, 0) is now the first segment of the body).\nLast Move Pick (T3): LEFT.\nIf T3 Move was LEFT: Previous Head must have been (2, 0).\nIf Head was (2, 0) and I moved LEFT, New Head is (1, 0). This is consistent with the T4 Head position.\nDid I eat an apple? Apple (1, 0) was present at T3. Yes, S0 ate (1, 0) at T3. Current length 2.\n\nEnemy S1: Head (4, 6), Body [(5, 6)]. S1 collected 1 apple.\n\nApples Available at T4 Start: (2, 7), (9, 4), (8, 9), (7, 0), (8, 4). (1, 0) is gone.\n\nBoard State Reconstructed for T4:\nS0: H(1, 0), B(2, 0).\nS1: H(4, 6), B(5, 6).\n\n**Analyzing Snake 1's (S1) potential move:**\nS1 Head (4, 6). Body (5, 6).\nUP (4, 7): Safe.\nDOWN (4, 5): Safe.\nLEFT (3, 6): Safe.\nRIGHT (5, 6): Collision with own body segment -> S1 Dies.\n\nS1 will choose UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n**My Move Options from H(1, 0), B(2, 0):**\nUP (1, 1): Safe.\nDOWN (1, -1): Wall/Death. (Eliminate DOWN)\nLEFT (0, 0): Safe.\nRIGHT (2, 0): Collision with own body segment -> Death. (Eliminate RIGHT)\n\nSafe Moves for S0: UP, LEFT.\n\n**Targeting Apples:**\nNearest apples are (7, 0) and (2, 7). (8, 4) and (9, 4) are far. (8, 9) is far.\n(7, 0) is far right. (2, 7) is far up.\n\nPath to (2, 7) seems better as it's closer in Manhattan distance (1 + 7 = 8 moves required roughly to reach the vicinity if unimpeded).\nPath to (7, 0) is ~6 moves required.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (0, 0): Closer to (2, 7) indirectly, but moves away from (7, 0).\nIf I move UP to (1, 1): Closer to (2, 7) potentially.\n\n**Collision Check (S0 vs S1):**\nS0 potential next positions: (1, 1) or (0, 0).\nS1 potential next positions: (4, 7), (4, 5), (3, 6).\n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk.\nNo risk of S1 moving into S0 body [(2, 0)].\n\n**Forward Planning:**\nIf I choose UP (1, 1): S0 moves towards (2, 7). S1 might move towards (4, 7) or (3, 6).\nIf S1 moves UP to (4, 7), and I move UP to (1, 1), we are moving somewhat parallel upwards.\n\nIf I choose LEFT (0, 0): S0 moves towards the left wall. S1 might move LEFT to (3, 6).\n\nThe apple at (2, 7) is slightly more central and reachable without immediately hugging a wall compared to the apple path towards (7, 0) coming from the bottom left corner.\n\nLet's aim for (2, 7). Moving UP gets me coordinates closer to 7.\n\nIf I move UP to (1, 1):\nT5 H(1, 1), B(1, 0), (2, 0).\nIf S1 moves UP to (4, 7).\n\nNext Turn (T5 -> T6): I want to move UP again to (1, 2). S1 might move UP to (4, 8). This path seems relatively safe for a few turns.\n\nIf I chose LEFT to (0, 0):\nT5 H(0, 0), B(1, 0), (2, 0).\nNext turn moves might be UP (0, 1) or RIGHT (1, 0) (Self-collision risk if I stay low). If I go UP to (0, 1), I am committed to hugging the left wall.\n\nI prefer UP to maintain slightly more central positioning while tracking towards (2, 7) and keeping space open.\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Target apple at (2, 7). Use UP moves initially to gain altitude quickly. Maintain one safe move always available (i.e., don't get cornered). Since the enemy is in the top right quadrant, moving UP seems prudent to eventually intersect paths safely or reach the target before them, although S1 is currently slightly ahead in vertical position (Y=6 vs Y=0).\n\nFinal decision: UP.\n\nUP",

If S1 ignores (2, 7) and moves towards other apples or walls, I secure position X=2 quickly. If S1 also targets (2, 7), being adjacent on the X-axis means we are both closing in optimally on Y progression.\n\nLet's commit to closing the gap vertically and moving towards X target.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Target apple at (2, 7). My current position is (1, 1). Move RIGHT to (2, 1) to align X coordinates with the target. Then proceed with UP moves toward Y=7. Monitor S1's position relative to (2, 7).

Score 2.\n\n**Current State (Start of Turn 7):**\nS0 Head: (2, 1). Body: [(1, 1), (1, 0)]. (Tail (1, 0) is about to move if not growing). Target (7, 0) or remaining apples. (2, 7) is gone.\nS1 Head: (2, 7). Body: [(3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6)]. Target likely (9, 4) or (8, 4).\n\n**S0 Safe Moves from (2, 1):** UP (2, 2), DOWN (2, 0), RIGHT (3, 1).\n\n**S1 Potential Moves from (2, 7):**\nUP (2, 8).\nDOWN (2, 6). Collision with S1 body segment (4, 6) / (3, 7)? (2, 6) is safe from its own body if it doesn't eat. Safe.\nLEFT (1, 7). Safe.\nRIGHT (3, 7). Collision with S1 previous head position from T6. Safe.\n\nSince S1 just ate and grew, it likely wants to move UP or RIGHT to stay central/hunt next apple.\n\nIf S0 moves UP to (2, 2). We are moving away from S1 which is high up.\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (2, 0). We move towards (7, 0). Requires 7 steps.\nIf S0 moves RIGHT to (3, 1). We continue horizontal expansion.\n\nSince S1 consumed the closest available apple and is now highly positioned, S0 should pivot slightly towards the next cluster of apples: (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 0). The proximity favors (7, 0). Moving DOWN/RIGHT brings us closer to this quadrant.\n\nMoving DOWN to (2, 0) positions us better relative to (7, 0) than staying flat by moving UP/RIGHT and letting them keep the initiative high. If we move DOWN, we are moving towards the bottom wall where we have more room to maneuver later compared to being boxed against the top wall by S1.\n\nIf S0 moves DOWN (2, 0). Since S0 did NOT eat at T6, the tail (1, 0) falls off.\nS0 T7 End: H(2, 0), B[(2, 1), (1, 1)]. Length 3.\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (2, 8).\nS0 is now at the bottom, S1 at the top. We have effectively reset proximity by moving away from the action. This grants flexibility.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Pivot towards the bottom right quadrant targeting apples (7, 0) and (8, 4). Move DOWN this turn to approach the bottom edge, ready for a stretch towards (7, 0). Maintain safety, especially checking for S1 moving down.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nTurn: 8 / 150\n\nApples at: (9, 4), (8, 9), (7, 0), (8, 4)\n\nScores so far:\n  - Your snake (ID 0) apples: 1\n  - Snake #1 apples: 2 (Assumed S1 ate A(2, 7) at T7)\n\nYour snake (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (2, 0). Body: [(2, 1), (1, 1)]. (Assuming RIGHT move from T7 resulted in H(2, 0), B[(2, 1), (1, 1)] if T6 move was RIGHT, not DOWN as Rationale claimed).\n\n**CRITICAL STATE RE-EVALUATION:** I must strictly follow the result of the LAST MOVE PICK, not the rationale for T7.\n\nT7 Move Pick was: DOWN.\nS0 Start T6: H(2, 1), B[(1, 1), (1, 0)]. (Length 3). T6 move RIGHT (3, 1) or UP (2, 2) or DOWN (2, 0).\nIf T7 Move was DOWN (from H(2, 1)): New Head (2, 0). Not apple. Tail (1, 0) falls off.\nS0 End T7 (Start T8): Head (2, 0). Body [(2, 1), (1, 1)]. Length 3. (This matches the projected state derived from the T7 rationale, assuming T6 move was RIGHT to (2, 1) as initially selected, which is inconsistent with the T6 Move Pick being RIGHT in the previous turn block, but consistent with the state transition assumed in the last rationale block).\n\n**Revisiting Move Consistency (Crucial): I MUST use the actual T7 move choice given ABOVE, which was DOWN.**\n\nS0 State at Start T7 (After T6 RIGHT assumed in Rationale): H(2, 1), B[(1, 1), (1, 0)].\nT7 Move Pick: DOWN.\nS0 T7 End: H(2, 0). Not eating. Tail (1, 0) falls off.\nS0 State at Start T8: H(2, 0). Body [(2, 1), (1, 1)]. Length 3. Score 1. (Matches current input interpretation for Body, except input body list is shorter than my reconstructed length 3. Input body: [(2, 1), (1, 1)]. This implies length 3. The cell (2, 0) was the head, (2, 1) is B1, (1, 1) is B2. This looks right if T6 move was to (2, 1) and T7 move was DOWN to (2, 0) and the tail fell off appropriately).\n\nS1 State at Start T8 (S1 moved LEFT to eat (2, 7) at T7):\nS1 End T7: H(2, 7). Body [(3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6)]. Length 5. Score 2. S1 is high up.\n\n**S0 Safe Moves from (2, 0):** Body positions: (2, 1), (1, 1).\nUP (2, 1): Collision with own body segment (2, 1). **Death.** (Eliminate UP)\nDOWN (2, -1): Wall/Death. (Eliminate DOWN)\nLEFT (1, 0): Safe.\nRIGHT (3, 0): Safe.\n\nSafe Moves: LEFT (1, 0), RIGHT (3, 0). We are at Y=0. Moving towards apples (7, 0) or (8, 4)/(9, 4).\n\n**S1 Potential Moves from (2, 7):**\nS1 is high up, moving towards (8, 9) or (9, 4).\nIf S1 goes UP (2, 8) or LEFT (1, 7).\n\nIf S0 moves RIGHT (3, 0): Closer to X=7, X=8, X=9 islands.\nIf S0 moves LEFT (1, 0): Closer to wall X=0.\n\nWe need to reach apples (7, 0), (8, 4), or (9, 4). Moving RIGHT seems the logical choice to begin advancing towards that quadrant along the bottom edge.\n\n**Checking for S1 collision risk:** S1 is at Y=7. We are at Y=0. No risk this turn.\n\n**S0 Long-Term Plan:** Move RIGHT along Y=0 to get closer to (7, 0). Then decide whether to go UP towards (8, 4) or stay low towards (7, 0). For now, RIGHT is the only move that facilitates horizontal progress toward the eastern apples while staying alive.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nTurn: 9 / 150\n\nApples at: (9, 4), (8, 9), (7, 0), (8, 4)\n\nScores so far:\n  - Your snake (ID 0) apples: 1\n  - Snake #1 apples: 2\n\nYour snake (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (3, 0). Body: [(2, 0), (2, 1)]. (Assuming RIGHT move from T8 resulted in H(3, 0), B[(2, 0), (2, 1)]).\n  - Apples collected: 1\n\nEnemy snakes:\n* Snake #1 - Head: (3, 7). Body: [(2, 7), (3, 7) - WRONG]. (S1 likely moved DOWN or LEFT from (2, 7) if it didn't eat).\n\n**CRITICAL STATE RE-EVALUATION based on T8 move RIGHT:**\nS0 Start T8: H(2, 0). Body [(2, 1), (1, 1)]. Length 3. (Not growing). Tail (1, 1) falls off.\nS0 T8 End (Start T9): H(3, 0). New Body: [(2, 0), (2, 1)]. Length 3. (This means the logic implied the tail (1, 1) fell off. If it did, the body list should be [(2, 0), (2, 1)], which implies the old head (2, 0) followed by the old B1 (2, 1). This requires the old B1 (2, 1) to become B2, and the old B2 (1, 1) to fall off. If H(2, 0) -> R -> H(3, 0), then New Body = [Old Head (2, 0), Old B1 (2, 1)]. Old B2 (1, 1) falls off. This matches the implied length 3 in the input interpretation, but the input itself does not provide the state explicitly, so I must proceed based on the assumption that the last move executed correctly).\n\nAssuming S0 is now at H(3, 0) and length 3 along Y=0.\n\n**S1 Prediction (From H(2, 7) start T8):**\nS1 is at (2, 7). Target (8, 9).\nMove UP to (2, 8) seems likely to chase the highest apple/stay central.\nIf S1 moved UP: T8 End S1: H(2, 8). Body from T7: [(3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6), (5, 6)].

Continuing RIGHT along Y=0 towards (7, 0) seems most direct.\n\nIf S0 moves RIGHT (4, 0):\nS0 T9 End: H(4, 0). Body guaranteed to lose tail (2, 1) if no growth. Length 3.\n\nIf S1 moves UP (2, 8):\nS1 T9 End: H(2, 8).\n\nThis approach keeps S0 low and moves horizontally. S1 is high and moving vertically. We wait for S1 to potentially overshoot or get trapped while we secure the corner apples.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Continue movement RIGHT along Y=0 towards apple (7, 0). Check for S1 descending or moving horizontally to intercept. Maintain safety margins, especially avoiding immediate backwards moves which are still possible (moving LEFT into (2, 0)).\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nTurn: 10 / 150\n\nApples at: (9, 4), (8, 9), (7, 0), (8, 4)\n\nScores so far:\n  - Your snake (ID 0) apples: 1\n  - Snake #1 apples: 2\n\nYour snake (ID: 0):\n  - Head: (4, 0).

We need to create space for maneuvering while S1 is relatively constrained by our current lead and proximity. Moving UP towards the top edge (Y=9) seems wiser than hugging the bottom edge (Y=0).\n\n**S1 Potential Moves from (6, 6):** S1 has no immediate high-value target. It might move towards (8, 9) if (8, 9) was still there, or towards (9, 4) which we just ate. (6, 6) is far from all remaining points (8, 9 is gone, all apples gone). This implies either S1 has no moves or the game is nearing its end state based on available apples OR all apples are gone.\n\nApples remaining: None listed, only (8, 9) gone. This means all 5 apples are gone: (2, 7), (1, 0 or 2, 0), (7, 0), (8, 4), (8, 9).\nIf all apples are gone, the game enters survival mode until Turn 150 or someone dies. S0 leads 4-3. S0 MUST NOT DIE.\n\n**S0 Long-Term Plan:** Maintain safety and maximize distance from S1. Since S1 is currently at (6, 6) and S0 is vulnerable against the right wall, moving UP to (9, 5) allows S0 an escape route towards the top edge (Y=9), creating more board space to operate than moving DOWN to Y=3. We must be very careful moving LEFT towards S1.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nTurn: 20 / 150\n\nApples at: None remaining.

Tail (7, 9) falls off.\nS1 T19 End: H(6, 5), B[(6, 6), (7, 7)]. L=3.\n\nThe provided S1 Head (5, 5) implies S1 moved diagonally (e.g., LEFT then DOWN, or by complex movement). If H(6, 6) -> H(5, 5) in one turn, this implies illegal diagonal movement, or move order wasn't simple N/S/E/W. Assuming the provided state H(5, 5) is the *actual* result of T19 move, and S1 did not die: it implies complex, perhaps diagonal, movement capability or a simplified board state tracking for enemies. I must assume standard N/S/E/W move and that the provided enemy state is the result of a valid move sequence not fully tracked here. Given distance (9 grid squares between S0 and S1 center mass), direct conflict is unlikely this turn.\n\n**S0 Safe Moves from (9, 5):** Body [(9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2)].\nUP (9, 6): Safe.\nDOWN (9, 4): Collision with body segment (9, 4). **Death.** (Eliminate DOWN)\nLEFT (8, 5): Safe.\nRIGHT (10, 5): Death. (Eliminate RIGHT)\n\nSafe Moves: UP (9, 6), LEFT (8, 5).\n\n**Strategy:** S0 is trapped on the right edge (X=9). We must move LEFT to escape the entrapment zone and maximize operational space, as S1 (at 5, 5) is centrally positioned and could potentially box us in later if we stay at X=9. Moving LEFT towards (8, 5) opens up UP/DOWN options along X=8.\n\n**S0 Long-Term Plan:** Move LEFT towards the center area (X=8 zone). Maintain distance from S1 around (5, 5). Since score difference is 4-3 (win condition pending turn 150), passive survival is key.\n\nLEFT",

Safe, but moves away from the immediate apple.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe apple at (2, 7) is adjacent to my head. Moving LEFT will collect it, increasing my score to 2 and my length to 3. This is the most efficient move.\n\nLEFT",
