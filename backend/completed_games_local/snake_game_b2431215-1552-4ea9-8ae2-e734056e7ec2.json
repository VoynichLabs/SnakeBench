Enemy snake #0 is at (5,8).\n\nFirst, I'll evaluate each possible move for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (1,7): That's an apple! But I must check if it's safe. Is (1,7) occupied? The board shows 'A' at (1,7), meaning it's an apple, so no snake body there. However, I need to consider if enemy snake #0 could move there simultaneously. Enemy is at (5,8). Possible moves for enemy: UP to (5,9), DOWN to (5,7), LEFT to (4,8), RIGHT to (6,8). None of those land on (1,7). So UP seems safe from immediate collision. Also, moving onto an apple is allowed and causes growth.\n\n- **DOWN** to (1,5): That's an empty cell ('.'). No immediate danger from board boundaries or bodies. Enemy moving there? Enemy at (5,8) cannot reach (1,5) in one move. Safe.\n\n- **LEFT** to (0,6): Empty cell. Within board. Safe.\n\n- **RIGHT** to (2,6): Empty cell. Safe.\n\nAll four moves appear immediately safe regarding board boundaries and static obstacles. However, I must consider potential head-on collisions with enemy snake #0. Enemy could move in any direction. I should think about where enemy might go.\n\nEnemy at (5,8). Possible enemy moves:\n- UP to (5,9): empty.\n- DOWN to (5,7): empty.\n- LEFT to (4,8): empty.\n- RIGHT to (6,8): empty.\n\nNone of these intersect with my possible moves except possibly if enemy moves DOWN to (5,7) and I move UP to (1,7) \u2014 different coordinates, so no collision. So no direct head-on collision risk this turn.\n\nNow, among safe moves, I should favor moves that increase chance of eating apples and keep future options open.\n\nApples nearby:\n- (1,7) is directly above me \u2014 UP.\n- (4,6) is to the right but three cells away.\n- (1,1) is far down.\n- (2,2) is diagonal.\n- (0,3) is left and down.\n\nUP gets an apple immediately, giving me a point and growing to length 2. That's advantageous. However, after eating, my body will occupy (1,6) and head at (1,7). That could limit future moves slightly, but it's early game.\n\nOther moves don't get apples this turn.\n\nLong-term strategy: Early game, collecting apples quickly can give an advantage, but I must avoid getting trapped. Since I'm length 1, I have more flexibility.\n\nConsidering future options after each move:\n- UP to (1,7): After eating, my body will be at (1,6). Next turn, from (1,7), possible moves: UP to (1,8) [empty], DOWN to (1,6) [my own body \u2014 would die], LEFT to (0,7) [empty], RIGHT to (2,7) [empty]. So three safe moves next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). That's okay.\n- DOWN to (1,5): Then from (1,5), next turn moves: UP back to (1,6) [empty now], DOWN to (1,4), LEFT to (0,5), RIGHT to (2,5). All four potentially safe. More options.\n- LEFT to (0,6): Then from (0,6), next turn: UP to (0,7), DOWN to (0,5), RIGHT to (1,6). LEFT would be off-board. So three safe moves.\n- RIGHT to (2,6): Then from (2,6), next turn: UP to (2,7), DOWN to (2,5), LEFT to (1,6), RIGHT to (3,6). All four safe.\n\nSo all moves give at least three safe follow-ups. UP gives three but also gets an apple now.\n\nI should also consider enemy movement. Enemy might go for apples too. The apple at (1,7) is close to me; enemy is far, so I have a good chance.\n\nGiven the objective to eat apples and survive, UP seems best because it gains an apple immediately without apparent risk.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating, I'll have a body segment. Avoid moving back into my own body. Consider moving towards other apples while keeping distance from enemy. Possibly head towards (4,6) or (2,2) after securing (1,7). Stay aware of enemy's position to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nUP",

Apple (4, 6) is central and equidistant to both snakes (M=4).\n\n**1. Candidate Moves for Snake 0 (6, 8):**\n*   **UP**: (6, 9)\n*   **DOWN**: (6, 7)\n*   **LEFT**: (5, 8)\n*   **RIGHT**: (7, 8)\n\n**2. Immediate Death Check for Snake 0:**\nMy snake has length 1. No self-collisions possible.\nAll four moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) lead to cells within the 10x10 bounds and are immediately safe from environmental death.\n\n**3. Collision Check (Enemy Body/Head):**\nEnemy 1's Body: (1, 6).\nEnemy 1's Head: (1, 7).\n\nNo move I make places me near Enemy 1's current position or body. Collision risk is negligible this turn.\n\n**4. Apple Assessment & Trajectory Selection (Target (4, 6)):**\nTargeting (4, 6) requires moving LEFT then DOWN. Target distance is 4.\n\n*   **Move LEFT (5, 8):** Puts me closer to (4, 6). Distance 3.\n*   **Move DOWN (6, 7):** Puts me closer to (4, 6). Distance 3.\n*   **Move UP (6, 9):** Moves away from all close apples.\n*   **Move RIGHT (7, 8):** Moves further from (4, 6). Distance 5. Moves slightly closer to (7, 2). Distance 6.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN are good opening moves toward (4, 6).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 8), I am now horizontal to the target, allowing a direct vertical approach (DOWN) next turn.\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 7), I am now vertical to the target, allowing a direct horizontal approach (LEFT) next turn.\n\nSince the enemy is on the far left, moving LEFT might position me defensively better if the enemy chooses to move inwards aggressively (e.g., towards (4, 6)). However, the difference is minimal. I will choose LEFT to start moving towards the center-left apple (4, 6) while staying away from the top boundary.\n\n**Plan for Next Turns:**\nMove LEFT (to 5, 8), then pivot DOWN (to 5, 7) or LEFT (to 4, 8) depending on Enemy 1's trajectory. Enemy 1 is currently targeting the same apple; I must decide whether to race for it or pivot to (7, 2). Since (4, 6) is the shortest path and located centrally, I will prioritize it for now.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Looking at the board, my snake (ID 1) is now at head (1,7) with a body segment at (1,6). I just ate an apple, so my length is 2. The apples are at (4,6), (1,1), (2,2), (0,3), (7,2). Enemy snake #0 is at head (6,8) with no body.\n\nFirst, I'll evaluate each possible move for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (1,8): Within board (0-9). Check for bodies: My body is at (1,6), enemy body is none. Enemy head is at (6,8), not (1,8). So no immediate collision with a body. Must also consider potential head-on collision: Could enemy move to (1,8) this turn? Enemy at (6,8) can move UP to (6,9), DOWN to (6,7), LEFT to (5,8), RIGHT to (7,8). None land on (1,8). So UP is safe.\n\n- **DOWN** to (1,6): That's my own body segment. Moving into my own body kills me, so DOWN is **not safe**.\n\n- **LEFT** to (0,7): Within board. Not occupied by any body. Enemy cannot reach (0,7) in one move from (6,8). Safe.\n\n- **RIGHT** to (2,7): Within board. Not occupied. Enemy cannot reach (2,7). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves are UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow, among safe moves, I should consider apple proximity and future options.\n\nApples:\n- (4,6) is to the right and down.\n- (1,1) is far down.\n- (2,2) is down and right.\n- (0,3) is left and down.\n- (7,2) is far right and down.\n\nFrom my head (1,7):\n- UP to (1,8) moves away from most apples but into open space.\n- LEFT to (0,7) moves towards apple (0,3) but still far.\n- RIGHT to (2,7) moves slightly towards apples (2,2) and (4,6).\n\nI should also consider future move options after each choice to avoid trapping myself.\n\nIf I move **UP** to (1,8):\n- Next turn, my body will be at [(1,7), (1,6)].\n- From (1,8), possible moves: UP to (1,9) [empty], DOWN to (1,7) [my body - unsafe], LEFT to (0,8) [empty], RIGHT to (2,8) [empty]. So three safe moves.\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (0,7):\n- Body: [(0,7), (1,6)]? Wait, careful: After moving, my head goes to (0,7). My body segments follow: the old head (1,7) becomes the first body segment, and the tail (1,6) remains. So body will be [(0,7), (1,7), (1,6)]? No, I only have one body segment currently (length 2). After moving, the head moves to new cell, and the body becomes the old head position. So body will be at (1,7). The tail (1,6) disappears because I didn't eat an apple this turn. So my snake will be: head at (0,7), body at (1,7). Length remains 2.\n- From (0,7), next turn moves: UP to (0,8) [empty], DOWN to (0,6) [empty], RIGHT to (1,7) [my body - unsafe]. LEFT is off-board. So two safe moves (UP, DOWN). That's more restrictive.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (2,7):\n- Body will be at (1,7).\n- From (2,7), next turn moves: UP to (2,8) [empty], DOWN to (2,6) [empty], LEFT to (1,7) [my body - unsafe], RIGHT to (3,7) [empty]. So three safe moves.\n\nSo LEFT gives only two safe follow-ups, while UP and RIGHT give three. I should avoid reducing my options.\n\nNow, consider enemy movement. Enemy at (6,8) might move towards apples. The closest apple to enemy is (7,2) or (4,6). It might move DOWN or LEFT. I should avoid moving into a potential head-on collision path. Currently, we are far apart, so low risk.\n\nGiven my goal to collect apples, moving RIGHT (to (2,7)) brings me slightly closer to apples (2,2) and (4,6). Moving UP takes me to the top edge, away from apples. Since apples are mostly in lower rows, moving DOWN would be beneficial, but DOWN is unsafe this turn. So RIGHT seems a better step towards future apple gathering.\n\nI should also think about the apple at (4,6). To reach it, I could go RIGHT then DOWN over several turns. Starting with RIGHT now is a step in that general direction.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After moving RIGHT, my head will be at (2,7), body at (1,7). Next turn, I can consider moving DOWN to (2,6) to get closer to apples (2,2) and (4,6). I must continue to monitor enemy position to avoid collisions.\n\nRIGHT",

Since it ate an apple last turn, it will grow, and its tail will remain at (1, 7) if it moves to a free cell.\n\nThe apples are at: $A_1=(4, 6)$, $A_2=(1, 1)$, $A_3=(2, 2)$, $A_4=(0, 3)$, $A_5=(7, 2)$.\n\n**Board State Review (10x10, (0,0) bottom-left, (9,9) top-right):**\nMy head: (5, 8)\nNearest Apple: $A_1(4, 6)$ - Manhattan Distance: $|5-4| + |8-6| = 1 + 2 = 3$ steps.\nSecond Nearest Apple: $A_5(7, 2)$ - Manhattan Distance: $|5-7| + |8-2| = 2 + 6 = 8$ steps.\n\nEnemy 1 head: (2, 7).

Candidate Moves for Snake 0 (5, 8):**\n*   **UP**: (5, 9)\n*   **DOWN**: (5, 7)\n*   **LEFT**: (4, 8)\n*   **RIGHT**: (6, 8)\n\n**2. Immediate Death Check for Snake 0:**\nMy snake has length 1. No self-collisions. All four moves are within board boundaries and safe from obstacles.\n\n**3. Collision Check (Enemy Body/Head):**\nEnemy 1 Body: (1, 7).\nEnemy 1 Head: (2, 7).\n\n*   My move UP (5, 9): Safe.\n*   My move DOWN (5, 7): Safe.\n*   My move LEFT (4, 8): Safe.\n*   My move RIGHT (6, 8): Safe.\n\nNo risk of hitting Enemy 1's current body or head.\n\n**4. Predicting Enemy 1's Move (Target $A_1(4, 6)$):**\nEnemy 1 (2, 7) is also targeting $A_1(4, 6)$ (M=3).\nPossible safe moves for Enemy 1:\n*   UP (2, 8): Distance to $A_1$ increases to 4. (Unlikely)\n*   DOWN (2, 6): Distance to $A_1$ decreases to 3. Positioned optimally for a right move next turn. (Likely)\n*   LEFT (1, 7): Hits own body segment at (1, 7) (collision rules say this is safe if it's the segment about to vacate, but since its length is 2 and it ate an apple last turn, it will grow to length 3, and the tail *will not* vacate (1, 7). Hitting (1, 7) results in death if the tail stays, which it will. Therefore, LEFT is a death move for S1). (Impossible/Death)\n*   RIGHT (3, 7): Distance to $A_1$ decreases to 2. Optimal path. (Most Likely)\n\nIf Enemy 1 moves RIGHT to (3, 7), they are only 2 steps from (4, 6).\n\n**5. Apple Assessment & Trajectory Selection:**\n\nI need to make an aggressive move towards $A_1(4, 6)$:\n\n*   **Move DOWN (5, 7):** Distance to $A_1$ is 2 steps (then L to (4, 7), then D to (4, 6)). This is a very strong move.\n*   **Move LEFT (4, 8):** Distance to $A_1$ is 3 steps (then D to (4, 7), then D to (4, 6)). Not as direct, as the subsequent DOWN move only reduces distance by 1.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the path starting from (5, 8) to (4, 6):\n1.  **If I choose DOWN (to 5, 7):** Next turn, I move LEFT (to 4, 7) [M=1]. Next turn, I move DOWN (to 4, 6) [Eat]. Total 3 moves.\n2.  **If I choose LEFT (to 4, 8):** Next turn, I move DOWN (to 4, 7) [M=2]. Next turn, I move DOWN (to 4, 6) [Eat]. Total 3 moves.\n\nWait, let's re-calculate distance reduction more carefully for both my paths, assuming Enemy 1 moves RIGHT to (3, 7) M=2:\n\n**My Path 1: DOWN -> LEFT -> DOWN (3 moves)**\n*   T2: Me (5, 7). Enemy (3, 7).\n*   T3: Me (4, 7) (M=1). Enemy (4, 7) (M=1). **CRITICAL HEAD-ON COLLISION!**\n    *   If I move LEFT to (4, 7).\n    *   If Enemy 1 moves RIGHT to (4, 7).\n    *   Both die. This path is too risky.\n\n**My Path 2: LEFT -> DOWN -> DOWN (3 moves)**\n*   T2: Me (4, 8). Enemy (3, 7).\n*   T3: Me (4, 7). Enemy (4, 7). **CRITICAL HEAD-ON COLLISION!**\n    *   If I move DOWN to (4, 7).\n    *   If Enemy 1 moves UP (to 3, 8) (M=3) or DOWN (to 3, 6) (M=2) or RIGHT (to 4, 7) (M=1). Moving RIGHT is the optimal capture move for S1.\n    *   Both die.\n\nI cannot safely race for $A_1(4, 6)$ if the enemy makes their optimal move (RIGHT to (3, 7), then RIGHT to (4, 7)). This is a guaranteed head-on collision at (4, 7) on Turn 3.\n\n**Alternative Strategy: Pivot to $A_5(7, 2)$**\nI must pivot to a safer, perhaps less optimal apple. $A_5(7, 2)$ is M=8 away.\n\nTo move to $A_5(7, 2)$:\n*   I am at (5, 8). Target (7, 2). I need +2 Right, -6 Down.\n*   **Move RIGHT (6, 8):** Distance M=7.\n*   **Move DOWN (5, 7):** Distance M=7.\n\nMoving RIGHT (6, 8) starts the horizontal movement needed. Moving DOWN (5, 7) starts the vertical movement. Starting with RIGHT keeps me further from the collision zone $A_1(4, 6)$.\n\n**Move RIGHT (6, 8):**\n*   T2: Me (6, 8). S1 expected (3, 7).\n*   T3: Move DOWN to (6, 7). S1 expected collision at (4, 7).\n\nThis seems like the safest and fastest way to reposition towards $A_5(7, 2)$ while allowing Enemy 1 to commit to the short-distance apples.\n\n**Plan for Next Turns:**\nMove RIGHT (6, 8).\nNext, move DOWN (6, 7), then continue moving RIGHT/DOWN towards (7, 2). The immediate focus is now $A_5(7, 2)$.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #0 is at (5,8) with no body.\n\nFirst, check each move for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (2,8): Within board (0-9). Check collisions: My body is at (1,7), enemy body is none. Enemy head is at (5,8), not (2,8). Potential head-on collision? Enemy could move LEFT to (4,8), RIGHT to (6,8), UP to (5,9), DOWN to (5,7). None land on (2,8). So UP is safe.\n\n- **DOWN** to (2,6): Within board. Not occupied by my body (at (1,7)) or enemy body. Enemy cannot reach (2,6) in one move. Safe.\n\n- **LEFT** to (1,7): That's my own body segment. Moving into my own body kills me. So LEFT is **not safe**.\n\n- **RIGHT** to (3,7): Within board. Not occupied. Enemy cannot reach (3,7). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow, evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.\n\nFrom head (2,7):\n- UP to (2,8): Moves away from most apples (which are lower rows).\n- DOWN to (2,6): Moves closer to apples (2,2) and (4,6).\n- RIGHT to (3,7): Moves horizontally, slightly towards apple (4,6) but less directly than DOWN.\n\nConsider future move options after each choice:\n\nIf I move **UP** to (2,8):\n- Next turn, my body will be at (2,7) (old head). Snake: head (2,8), body (2,7).\n- From (2,8), possible moves: UP to (2,9) [empty], DOWN to (2,7) [my body - unsafe], LEFT to (1,8) [empty], RIGHT to (3,8) [empty]. So three safe moves.\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (2,6):\n- Body will be at (2,7).\n- From (2,6), possible moves: UP to (2,7) [my body - unsafe], DOWN to (2,5) [empty], LEFT to (1,6) [empty], RIGHT to (3,6) [empty]. So three safe moves.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (3,7):\n- Body will be at (2,7).\n- From (3,7), possible moves: UP to (3,8) [empty], DOWN to (3,6) [empty], LEFT to (2,7) [my body - unsafe], RIGHT to (4,7) [empty]. So three safe moves.\n\nAll three safe moves give three safe follow-ups. However, DOWN puts me closer to multiple apples (2,2) and (4,6). The apple at (4,6) is at x=4, y=6. From (2,6), I'd be at y=6, x=2, so I need to move right twice to reach it, while avoiding my body and enemy.\n\nAlso consider enemy movement: Enemy at (5,8) might move towards apples like (4,6) or (7,2). If enemy moves DOWN to (5,7) or LEFT to (4,8), it could become a threat. Moving DOWN to (2,6) keeps me at a safe distance for now.\n\nLong-term plan: Head towards the cluster of apples in the lower left: (1,1), (2,2), (0,3). Moving DOWN is a step in that direction. After DOWN, next turn I could go LEFT to (1,6) or RIGHT to (3,6), then continue down. I should monitor enemy to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nGiven the objective to collect apples and the safe moves, DOWN seems best as it directly progresses toward multiple apples while keeping options open.\n\nDOWN",

Apple Assessment & Trajectory Selection:**\n\nSince Enemy 1 has a guaranteed capture of $A_1(4, 6)$ on Turn 4 (if they move RIGHT this turn to (3, 6), then RIGHT again to (4, 6)), I should abandon the race for $A_1$.\n\nMy new focus is the nearest available apple not immediately threatened: $A_5(7, 2)$.\n\n**Moving toward $A_5(7, 2)$ from (6, 8):**\nThe ideal path involves moving DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n*   **Move DOWN (6, 7):** Reduces distance to $A_5$ to M=6.\n    *   T4: (6, 6) (M=5).\n    *   T5: (7, 6) (M=4).\n    *   T6: (7, 5) (M=3).\n    *   T7: (7, 4) (M=2).\n    *   T8: (7, 3) (M=1).\n    *   T9: (7, 2) [Eat].\n    *   Total 6 moves needed.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (7, 8):** Reduces distance to $A_5$ to M=7. (Worse than DOWN).\n\n*   **Move LEFT (5, 8):** Increases distance to $A_5$ to M=8. (Bad).\n\nThe move **DOWN (6, 7)** is the best choice to start the descent towards $A_5(7, 2)$. It also keeps me far away from the potential future body segments of S1, who will be expanding in the area around (4, 6).\n\nTherefore, I choose DOWN.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** I am abandoning $A_1(4, 6)$ to Enemy 1. I will execute a sequence of moves to capture $A_5(7, 2)$ over the next 6 turns: DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, EAT. Subsequently, I will assess the other apples $A_2, A_3, A_4$.\n\nDOWN",

Body: (2, 6). Length 2.\nEnemy 1 closest apple: $A_1(4, 6)$ - Manhattan Distance: $|3-4| + |6-6| = 1 + 0 = 1$ step. S1 is positioned for immediate capture of $A_1$.\n\nThe last rationale predicted Enemy 1 would move RIGHT from (2, 6) to (3, 6) to set up the capture of $A_1(4, 6)$. This prediction was correct. I moved DOWN from (6, 8) to (6, 7) to abandon $A_1$ and head towards $A_5(7, 2)$.\n\n### Strategy Recalibration\n\nEnemy 1 is about to take $A_1(4, 6)$ this turn (Turn 4). My previous plan was to move towards $A_5(7, 2)$.\n\n**Desired Capture for Snake 0: $A_5(7, 2)$** (M=6)\nCurrent position: (6, 7).\nSequence planned: DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, EAT (Total 6 moves needed from (6, 7)).\n\n**1. Candidate Moves for Snake 0 (6, 7):**\n*   **UP**: (6, 8) (M to $A_5$: 7)\n*   **DOWN**: (6, 6) (M to $A_5$: 5) - *Optimal for $A_5$*\n*   **LEFT**: (5, 7) (M to $A_5$: 7)\n*   **RIGHT**: (7, 7) (M to $A_5$: 5) - *Optimal for $A_5$*\n\n**2. Immediate Death Check for Snake 0 (Length 1):**\nAll moves lead to safe squares on the board.\n\n**3. Collision Check (Enemy Body/Head):**\nEnemy 1 Body: (2, 6). Enemy 1 Head: (3, 6).\n\n*   My move DOWN (6, 6): Safe.\n*   My move RIGHT (7, 7): Safe.\n*   My move UP (6, 8): Safe.\n*   My move LEFT (5, 7): Safe.\n\n**4. Predicting Enemy 1's Move (Target $A_1(4, 6)$):**\nEnemy 1 (3, 6) is M=1 from $A_1(4, 6)$.\nPossible safe moves for Enemy 1:\n*   UP (3, 7): M to $A_1$ increases to 2. (Unlikely)\n*   DOWN (3, 5): M to $A_1$ increases to 2. (Unlikely)\n*   LEFT (2, 6): Hits own body segment at (2, 6). (Lethal self-collision. Impossible).\n*   **RIGHT (4, 6):** Eats $A_1$. **(Most Likely)**\n\nIf Enemy 1 moves RIGHT to (4, 6), they will eat $A_1$.\n\n**5. Trajectory Selection for Snake 0:**\nI need to start moving towards $A_5(7, 2)$. Both DOWN to (6, 6) and RIGHT to (7, 7) reduce the distance to $A_5$ to M=5.\n\n*   If I choose **DOWN** to (6, 6): Next turn, I can move RIGHT to (7, 6) (M=4), continuing the path smoothly.\n*   If I choose **RIGHT** to (7, 7): Next turn, I can move DOWN to (7, 6) (M=4), continuing the path smoothly.\n\nChoosing **RIGHT** (7, 7) positions me slightly better for a quick descent, as it aligns my x-coordinate with the apple, allowing for a vertical run down the 7-column.\n\nIf I choose RIGHT (7, 7):\nT5: (7, 6) [DOWN] (M=4)\nT6: (7, 5) [DOWN] (M=3)\nT7: (7, 4) [DOWN] (M=2)\nT8: (7, 3) [DOWN] (M=1)\nT9: (7, 2) [DOWN - EAT]\nCapture in 5 turns total.\n\nIf I choose DOWN (6, 6):\nT5: (7, 6) [RIGHT] (M=4)\nT6: (7, 5) [DOWN] (M=3)\nT7: (7, 4) [DOWN] (M=2)\nT8: (7, 3) [DOWN] (M=1)\nT9: (7, 2) [DOWN - EAT]\nCapture in 5 turns total.\n\nBoth moves are equally efficient for capture time. I will choose **RIGHT** because it immediately aligns me with the target column (x=7), making the subsequent moves straightforward (mostly DOWN). This seems slightly safer as I quickly move away from the conflict area (x=4, y=6).\n\nThe long-term plan will be: RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, EAT.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** Continuing the plan to capture $A_5(7, 2)$. Execute 5 moves starting with RIGHT: RIGHT (T4), DOWN (T5), DOWN (T6), DOWN (T7), DOWN (T8), DOWN (T9 - EAT).\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #0 is at (6,7) with no body.\n\nFirst, check each move for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (3,7): Within board (0-9). Check collisions: My body is at (2,6). Enemy body is none. Enemy head is at (6,7). No immediate collision. Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (3,5): Within board. Not occupied by my body. Enemy cannot reach (3,5). Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (2,6): That's my own body segment at (2,6). Moving into my own body kills me. So LEFT is **not safe**.\n- **RIGHT** to (4,6): That's an apple. Moving onto an apple is safe (I will grow after moving). Check for collisions with enemy: Enemy head is at (6,7), not (4,6). Safe.\n\nSo safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nNow evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.\n\nFrom head (3,6):\n- **UP** to (3,7): Moves away from the apple at (4,6) and the lower-left cluster.\n- **DOWN** to (3,5): Moves away from apple (4,6) and toward the lower-left cluster.\n- **RIGHT** to (4,6): Eats the apple immediately, growing to length 3. This increases my score to 2 apples.\n\nConsider future move options after each choice:\n\nIf I move **UP** to (3,7):\n- Next turn, my body will be at (3,6). Snake: head (3,7), body (3,6).\n- From (3,7), possible moves: UP to (3,8) [empty], DOWN to (3,6) [my body - unsafe], LEFT to (2,7) [empty], RIGHT to (4,7) [empty]. So three safe moves.\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (3,5):\n- Body will be at (3,6).\n- From (3,5), possible moves: UP to (3,6) [my body - unsafe], DOWN to (3,4) [empty], LEFT to (2,5) [empty], RIGHT to (4,5) [empty]. So three safe moves.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (4,6):\n- I eat the apple, so my body will be at (3,6) and I will grow, so my new body will be: head (4,6), body (3,6), and an additional segment at (2,6) (since I had length 2, after eating I become length 3, so my tail remains at (2,6) for now). Actually, after eating, the new segment is added at the tail, so my body becomes [(3,6), (2,6)] and a new tail will appear at the old tail position? Wait, in standard snake, when you eat, you grow by one, meaning the tail doesn't move that turn. So after moving to (4,6), my body will be: head (4,6), then (3,6), then (2,6). So length 3.\n- From (4,6), possible moves: UP to (4,7) [empty], DOWN to (4,5) [empty], LEFT to (3,6) [my body - unsafe], RIGHT to (5,6) [empty]. So three safe moves.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (4,6) is highly advantageous: it gives me an apple, increasing my lead to 2-0 over the enemy. The enemy is at (6,7), two steps away from that apple, and they might be heading elsewhere. There's no risk of head-on collision because the enemy cannot reach (4,6) this turn (they are at (6,7), so their possible moves are to (5,7), (7,7), (6,8), (6,6)). So the apple is mine.\n\nLong-term plan: After eating the apple at (4,6), I'll be at (4,6) with length 3. Next turn, I should consider moving toward another apple, likely the cluster at (2,2) and (1,1). I'll need to navigate safely, avoiding my own growing body. The enemy is still short and not an immediate threat, but I should keep distance.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move RIGHT this turn to (4,6) to eat the apple. Next turn, from (4,6), I'll have safe moves UP, DOWN, RIGHT. I'll likely choose DOWN to (4,5) to start moving toward the lower-left apples, or RIGHT to (5,6) to explore the right side, but DOWN seems better to approach (2,2). I'll reassess then.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples: 0.\n*   **Enemy Snake 1 (ID 1):** Head at (4, 6). Body: [(3, 6), (2, 6)]. Length 3 (2 apples + initial length 1). Apples: 2.\n*   **Apples:** $A_1(1, 1)$, $A_2(2, 2)$, $A_3(0, 3)$, $A_4(7, 2)$, $A_5(3, 8)$.\n\n**Analysis of Previous Turn (Turn 4):**\nThe rationale from Turn 4 correctly predicted that Enemy 1 would move RIGHT to (4, 6) to capture the apple previously at (4, 6).\nMy move was **RIGHT** from (6, 7) to (7, 7).\nCurrent State corroborates: My snake is now at (7, 7). Snake 1's head is at (4, 6) and it has 2 apples and a length of 3, confirming it ate the apple at (4, 6). The board state shows the new position of Enemy 1's body segments.\n\n### 2. Identifying Targets and Distances\n\nMy Snake Head (S0): (7, 7).\nEnemy Snake 1 Head (S1): (4, 6).\n\n| Apple | Position | S0 Distance (M) | S1 Distance (M) |\n| :---: | :------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |\n| $A_4$ | (7, 2) | $|7-7| + |7-2| = 5$ | $|4-7| + |6-2| = 7$ |\n| $A_5$ | (3, 8) | $|7-3| + |7-8| = 5$ | $|4-3| + |6-8| = 3$ |\n| $A_2$ | (2, 2) | $|7-2| + |7-2| = 10$ | $|4-2| + |6-2| = 6$ |\n\n*   **Primary Target for S0:** $A_4(7, 2)$ or $A_5(3, 8)$. Both are 5 steps away.\n*   **Primary Target for S1:** $A_5(3, 8)$ is only 3 steps away, making it S1's immediate threat.\n\n**New Priority:** S1 is closer to $A_5(3, 8)$ (M=3) than I am (M=5). I need to abandon $A_5(3, 8)$ and focus solely on $A_4(7, 2)$ (M=5).\n\n**Goal for S0:** Capture $A_4(7, 2)$.\n\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (7, 7)\n\nMy snake is length 1. It only occupies (7, 7).\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check | M to $A_4(7, 2)$ | Status |\n| :--: | :----------: | :-------------: | :--------------: | :----: |\n| UP | (7, 8) | Safe (On Board) | $|7-7| + |8-2| = 6$ | Worse |\n| DOWN | (7, 6) | Safe (On Board) | $|7-7| + |6-2| = 4$ | Best |\n| LEFT | (6, 7) | Safe (On Board) | $|6-7| + |7-2| = 6$ | Worse |\n| RIGHT | (8, 7) | Safe (On Board) | $|8-7| + |7-2| = 6$ | Worse |\n\nThe optimal move towards $A_4(7, 2)$ is **DOWN** to (7, 6), reducing the distance to 4.\n\n### 4. Immediate Death and Collision Check (S0 moving to (7, 6))\n\n1.  **Off-Board:** (7, 6) is safe.\n2.  **Self-Collision:** Snake length 1, no self-collision risk.\n3.  **Enemy Body/Head Collision:**\n    *   S1 Head/Body: (4, 6), (3, 6), (2, 6).\n    *   (7, 6) is safe from existing S1 segments.\n\n### 5. Prediction of Enemy 1's Move (4, 6)\n\nS1 is at (4, 6), aiming for $A_5(3, 8)$ (M=3). The path requires moving LEFT and UP.\nPossible directions for S1 from (4, 6):\n\n*   UP (4, 7): M to $A_5$ is 4. (Worse than optimum).\n*   DOWN (4, 5): M to $A_5$ is 4. (Worse than optimum).\n*   LEFT (3, 6): Hits its own body segment at (3, 6). **(Lethal self-collision, impossible).**\n*   RIGHT (5, 6): M to $A_5$ is 4. (Worse than optimum).\n\nWait, the previous segments are (3, 6) and (2, 6). If S1 moves LEFT to (3, 6), it moves into its own segment *unless* that segment also moves out of the way. Since snakes move simultaneously, if S1 is length 3, its **tail** is at (2, 6). If it moves LEFT to (3, 6), this cell is the second segment. It seems highly likely that in this multi-player environment, moving onto a non-tail segment kills the snake (based on standard Snake rules and the \"into your own body (including backwards) counts as hitting yourself and you die\" rule).\n\nHowever, the problem statement provides standard multiplayer rules which often restrict turning back or into non-tail body parts. Let's re-examine S1's body: Head: (4, 6), Body: [(3, 6), (2, 6)].\nIf S1 moves:\n*   LEFT to (3, 6): It hits its second segment. **Fatal.**\n\nTherefore, S1 cannot move LEFT. S1 must move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. All safe moves increase the distance to $A_5(3, 8)$, which is unexpected for an efficient AI.\n\nLet's assume S1 is prioritizing $A_5(3, 8)$.\n*   Move UP to (4, 7): M=4.\n*   Move DOWN to (4, 5): M=4.\n*   Move RIGHT to (5, 6): M=4.\n\nMoving UP (4, 7) best positions S1 to then move LEFT on the next turn towards the x=3 column where $A_5$ sits.\n**Prediction: S1 moves UP to (4, 7).**\n\n### 6. Head-on Collision Check\n\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (7, 6) and S1 moves UP to (4, 7). No interaction.\n\n### 7. Trajectory Confirmation\n\nS0 should move **DOWN** to (7, 6) to efficiently target $A_4(7, 2)$.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** I am aiming for $A_4(7, 2)$. Current position (7, 7).\nT5: DOWN to (7, 6). (M=4)\nT6: DOWN to (7, 5). (M=3)\nT7: DOWN to (7, 4). (M=2)\nT8: DOWN to (7, 3). (M=1)\nT9: DOWN to (7, 2).

They are not an immediate threat, but I should be aware of their potential movement. They could move toward the apple at (7,2) or (3,8). Moving UP puts me closer to (3,8), which they might also target.\n\nGiven my lead (2 apples vs. 0), my priority is to safely collect more apples while avoiding traps. The cluster of three apples in the lower-left (1,1), (2,2), (0,3) is highly valuable and relatively isolated. Moving DOWN starts a path toward them. Moving UP targets a single apple at (3,8), which is also near the enemy.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Start heading toward the lower-left apple cluster. Move DOWN this turn to (4,5). Next turn, from (4,5), I can continue DOWN or move LEFT to approach (2,2). I'll need to navigate carefully as my body grows, but the area is open.

Note: The apple locations provided in the prompt match these.\n\n**Rethinking Enemy 1's Last Move:**\nLast turn, S1 was at (4, 6). Possible move to target $A_5(3, 8)$ (M=3).\nMoves increasing M to (3, 8): UP (4, 7), DOWN (4, 5), RIGHT (5, 6).\nMove leading to collision: LEFT (3, 6).\nS1 chose **DOWN** to (4, 5). This moves further away from its primary target ($A_5(3, 8)$). It is possible S1 aims for $A_2(2, 2)$ (M=6 from (4, 5)) or $A_1(1, 1)$ (M=7 from (4, 5)), or perhaps it was avoiding a potential future collision if it went UP.\n\nFor now, my goal remains $A_4(7, 2)$.\n\n### 2. Identifying Targets and Distances\n\nMy Snake Head (S0): (7, 6).\nEnemy Snake 1 Head (S1): (4, 5).\n\n| Apple | Position | S0 Distance (M) | S1 Distance (M) |\n| :---: | :------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |\n| $A_4$ | (7, 2) | $|7-7| + |6-2| = 4$ | $|4-7| + |5-2| = 6$ |\n| $A_5$ | (3, 8) | $|7-3| + |6-8| = 6$ | $|4-3| + |5-8| = 4$ |\n| $A_2$ | (2, 2) | $|7-2| + |6-2| = 9$ | $|4-2| + |5-2| = 5$ |\n| $A_3$ | (0, 3) | $|7-0| + |6-3| = 10$ | $|4-0| + |5-3| = 6$ |\n| $A_1$ | (1, 1) | $|7-1| + |6-1| = 11$ | $|4-1| + |5-1| = 7$ |\n\n*   **Primary Target for S0:** $A_4(7, 2)$ (M=4). S0 is significantly closer to this apple than S1 (M=6).\n*   **Primary Target for S1:** $A_2(2, 2)$ (M=5) or $A_5(3, 8)$ (M=4). $A_5$ is nearest, but S1 moved away from it last turn. Given S1's move to (4, 5), $A_2(2, 2)$ seems like a plausible new target (M=5, requiring LEFT and DOWN movement).\n\n**S0 Goal:** Continue pursuit of $A_4(7, 2)$.\n\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (7, 6)\n\nMy snake occupies (7, 6).\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check | M to $A_4(7, 2)$ | Status |\n| :--: | :----------: | :-------------: | :--------------: | :----: |\n| UP | (7, 7) | Safe | 5 | Worse |\n| DOWN | (7, 5) | Safe | 3 | Best |\n| LEFT | (6, 6) | Safe | 5 | Worse |\n| RIGHT | (8, 6) | Safe | 5 | Worse |\n\nThe optimal move towards $A_4(7, 2)$ is **DOWN** to (7, 5), reducing the distance to 3.\n\n### 4. Immediate Death and Collision Check (S0 moving to (7, 5))\n\n1.  **Off-Board:** (7, 5) is safe.\n2.  **Self-Collision:** Snake length 1, no self-collision risk.\n3.  **Enemy Body/Head Collision:**\n    *   S1 Head: (4, 5). S1 Body: (4, 6), (3, 6).\n    *   (7, 5) is safe from existing S1 segments.\n\nThe move DOWN is safe.\n\n### 5. Prediction of Enemy 1's Move (4, 5)\n\nS1 is at (4, 5), length 3. Body segments are (4, 6), (3, 6). The tail is at (3, 6) and will disappear if S1 doesn't eat an apple. *Wait: S1's body description is Head: (4, 5), Body: [(4, 6), (3, 6)]. The tail is (3, 6).*\n\nS1 needs to choose between $A_5(3, 8)$ (M=4, UP/LEFT path) and $A_2(2, 2)$ (M=5, LEFT/DOWN path).\n\n*   Target $A_5(3, 8)$: Optimal move is UP or LEFT.\n    *   UP (4, 6): Hits its own body segment at (4, 6). **FATAL.** S1 came from (4, 6) last turn.\n    *   LEFT (3, 5): M to $A_5$ is 4. (Optimal distance reduction).\n*   Target $A_2(2, 2)$: Optimal move is LEFT or DOWN.\n    *   DOWN (4, 4): M to $A_2$ is 5.\n    *   LEFT (3, 5): M to $A_2$ is 4. (Optimal distance reduction).\n\nIt appears both targets are reached most efficiently by moving LEFT to (3, 5). This seems to be S1's most rational move.\n\n**Prediction: S1 moves LEFT to (3, 5).**\n\n### 6. Head-on Collision Check\n\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (7, 5) and S1 moves LEFT to (3, 5). The path is clear. No direct collision risk.\n\n### 7. Trajectory Confirmation\n\nS0 successfully commits to the plan to capture $A_4$ safely.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** I am aiming for $A_4(7, 2)$. Current position (7, 6).\nT6: DOWN to (7, 5). (M=3)\nT7: DOWN to (7, 4). (M=2)\nT8: DOWN to (7, 3). (M=1)\nT9: DOWN to (7, 2). (EAT)\nCapture planned in 3 more moves.\n\nDOWN",

Enemy snake #0 is at (7,6) with no body.\n\nFirst, check each move for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (4,6): That's my own body segment at (4,6). Moving into my own body kills me. So UP is **not safe**.\n- **DOWN** to (4,4): Within board (0-9). Check collisions: My body is at (4,6) and (3,6). Enemy body is none. Enemy head is at (7,6). No immediate collision. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (3,5): Within board. Not occupied by my body or enemy. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (5,5): Within board. Not occupied by my body or enemy. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.\n\nFrom head (4,5):\n- **DOWN** to (4,4): Moves toward the cluster of apples at (2,2), (1,1), and (0,3). Manhattan distance to (2,2) reduces from 4 to 3.\n- **LEFT** to (3,5): Moves slightly toward the lower-left apples and also toward the apple at (3,8) via a vertical move later. Manhattan distance to (2,2) reduces from 4 to 3 as well.\n- **RIGHT** to (5,5): Moves away from most apples, but explores the right side. Moves slightly toward the apple at (7,2) (distance from 5 to 4).\n\nConsider future move options after each choice:\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (4,4):\n- Next turn, my body will be at (4,5) and (4,6). From (4,4), possible moves: UP to (4,5) [my body - unsafe], DOWN to (4,3) [empty], LEFT to (3,4) [empty], RIGHT to (5,4) [empty]. So three safe moves. This continues toward the apple cluster.\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (3,5):\n- Next turn, my body will be at (4,5) and (4,6). From (3,5), possible moves: UP to (3,6) [my body - unsafe], DOWN to (3,4) [empty], LEFT to (2,5) [empty], RIGHT to (4,5) [my body - unsafe]. So only two safe moves (DOWN, LEFT). This reduces future options significantly and could lead to a trap if I grow.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (5,5):\n- Next turn, my body will be at (4,5) and (4,6). From (5,5), possible moves: UP to (5,6) [empty], DOWN to (5,4) [empty], LEFT to (4,5) [my body - unsafe], RIGHT to (6,5) [empty]. So three safe moves. This moves toward the apple at (7,2) but also toward the enemy at (7,6).\n\nThe enemy snake #0 is at (7,6) with no body and 0 apples. They are not an immediate threat, but they might move toward the apple at (7,2) or (3,8). Moving RIGHT puts me on a path that could intersect with them if they move down/left.\n\nGiven my lead (2 apples vs. 0), my priority is to safely collect more apples while avoiding traps. The cluster of three apples in the lower-left (1,1), (2,2), (0,3) is highly valuable and relatively isolated. Moving DOWN continues the path toward them I started last turn. Moving LEFT reduces future options, which is risky. Moving RIGHT goes toward the enemy and only one apple.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Continue heading toward the lower-left apple cluster. Move DOWN this turn to (4,4). Next turn, from (4,4), I can continue DOWN to (4,3) or move LEFT to (3,4) to approach (2,2). I'll need to navigate carefully as my body grows, but the area is open. I'll keep the enemy's position in mind, but they are far away and short, so immediate collision risk is low.\n\nDOWN",

My immediate target is the apple at (2,2). From (4,4), both DOWN and LEFT reduce the Manhattan distance equally. However, moving DOWN to (4,3) sets me up for a potential direct path: next turn I could go LEFT to (3,3) or DOWN to (4,2) to get even closer. Moving LEFT to (3,4) also works, but then I'm more aligned horizontally; I'd need to go DOWN twice to reach (2,2). Moving DOWN seems more direct. Also, moving DOWN keeps my body in a vertical line, which might be easier to navigate in the open lower-left area without boxing myself in. I'll choose DOWN this turn.\n\nDOWN",

S1 prioritized moving further down towards $A_2(2, 2)$ or $A_1(1, 1)$.\n*   **Apples:** $A_1(1, 1)$, $A_2(2, 2)$, $A_3(0, 3)$, $A_4(7, 2)$, $A_5(3, 8)$.\n\n**S0 Goal:** Capture $A_4(7, 2)$.\n\n### 2. Identifying Targets and Distances\n\nMy Snake Head (S0): (7, 4).\nEnemy Snake 1 Head (S1): (4, 3).\n\n| Apple | Position | S0 Distance (M) | S1 Distance (M) |\n| :---: | :------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |\n| $A_4$ | (7, 2) | $|7-7| + |4-2| = 2$ | $|4-7| + |3-2| = 4$ |\n| $A_5$ | (3, 8) | $|7-3| + |4-8| = 8$ | $|4-3| + |3-8| = 6$ |\n| $A_2$ | (2, 2) | $|7-2| + |4-2| = 7$ | $|4-2| + |3-2| = 3$ |\n| $A_3$ | (0, 3) | $|7-0| + |4-3| = 8$ | $|4-0| + |3-3| = 4$ |\n| $A_1$ | (1, 1) | $|7-1| + |4-1| = 9$ | $|4-1| + |3-1| = 5$ |\n\n*   **S0 Status:** $A_4(7, 2)$ (M=2) is the closest target.\n*   **S1 Status:** $A_2(2, 2)$ (M=3) is the closest target.\n\n**S0 Goal:** Continue pursuit of $A_4(7, 2)$.\n\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (7, 4)\n\nMy snake occupies (7, 4).\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check | M to $A_4(7, 2)$ | Status |\n| :--: | :----------: | :-------------: | :--------------: | :----: |\n| UP | (7, 5) | Safe (Empty) | 3 | Worse |\n| DOWN | (7, 3) | Safe | 1 | Best |\n| LEFT | (6, 4) | Safe | 3 | Worse |\n| RIGHT | (8, 4) | Safe | 3 | Worse |\n\nThe optimal move towards $A_4(7, 2)$ is **DOWN** to (7, 3), reducing the distance to 1.\n\n### 4. Immediate Death and Collision Check (S0 moving to (7, 3))\n\n1.  **Off-Board:** (7, 3) is safe.\n2.  **Self-Collision:** Snake length 1, no risk.\n3.  **Enemy Body/Head Collision:**\n    *   S1 Head: (4, 3). S1 Body: (4, 4), (4, 5).\n    *   (7, 3) is safe from existing S1 segments.\n\nThe move DOWN is safe.\n\n### 5. Prediction of Enemy 1's Move (4, 3)\n\nS1 is at (4, 3), length 3. S1 is likely targeting $A_2(2, 2)$ (M=3).\n\n*   Target $A_2(2, 2)$:\n    *   DOWN (4, 2): M to $A_2$ is 4. (Worse distance, but possible if it is prioritizing vertical movement).\n    *   LEFT (3, 3): M to $A_2$ is 3. (No improvement)\n    *   UP (4, 4): Hits body at (4, 4). **FATAL.**\n    *   RIGHT (5, 3): M to $A_2$ is 4. (Worse)\n\nGiven S1 cannot move UP, its best options that maintain or improve distance to $A_2(2, 2)$ (M=3) are:\n1. LEFT to (3, 3). M=3.\n2. DOWN (4, 2). M=4. (Slower path, but keeps S1 moving away from its body)\n\nSince S1 moved DOWN last turn, it might continue DOWN to (4, 2), potentially using the maneuver LEFT at the next opportunity. However, LEFT to (3, 3) is safer distance-wise and avoids heading into corner if it is heading for $A_2$.\n\nLet's assume S1 moves **LEFT** to (3, 3). This is the most logical path towards $A_2(2, 2)$ without colliding with its own body.\n\n### 6. Head-on Collision Check\n\nIf S0 moves DOWN to (7, 3) and S1 moves LEFT to (3, 3).\n\nS0 moves to (7, 3). S1 moves to (3, 3). They are far apart. No direct collision risk.\n\n### 7. Strategic Review\n\nS0 needs 2 more moves to capture $A_4(7, 2)$:\nT8: DOWN to (7, 3).\nT9: DOWN to (7, 2). (EAT)\n\nThis path is clear and uncontested by S1, which is focused on the left side of the board. The plan remains sound.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** I am aiming for $A_4(7, 2)$. Current position (7, 4).\nT8: DOWN to (7, 3). (M=1)\nT9: DOWN to (7, 2). (EAT)\nAfter capturing $A_4$, the next logical target is $A_5(3, 8)$ (M=8 currently), or $A_2(2, 2)$ (M=7 currently), depending on S1's position and the state of $A_2$.\n\nDOWN",

Enemy snake #0 is at (7,4) with no body.\n\nFirst, check each move for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (4,4): That's my own body segment at (4,4). Moving into my own body kills me. So UP is **not safe**.\n- **DOWN** to (4,2): Within board (0-9). Check collisions: My body is at (4,4) and (4,5). Enemy body is none. Enemy head is at (7,4). No immediate collision.

Safe.\n\nSo safe moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nNow evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.\n\nFrom head (4,3):\n- **DOWN** to (4,2): Moves toward the cluster of apples at (2,2) and (1,1). Manhattan distance to (2,2) reduces from |4-2|+|3-2|=2+1=3 to |4-2|+|2-2|=2+0=2. Also moves toward (1,1) and (0,3).\n- **LEFT** to (3,3): Moves toward the same cluster. Distance to (2,2) becomes |3-2|+|3-2|=1+1=2, also reduces from 3 to 2.\n- **RIGHT** to (5,3): Moves away from the lower-left cluster. Distance to (2,2) increases to |5-2|+|3-2|=3+1=4. Moves toward the apple at (7,2) (distance from 5 to 4).\n\nConsider future move options after each choice:\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (4,2):\n- Next turn, my body will be at (4,3) and (4,4).

From (3,3), possible moves: UP to (3,4) [empty], DOWN to (3,2) [empty], LEFT to (2,3) [empty], RIGHT to (4,3) [my body - unsafe]. So three safe moves. This also approaches the cluster.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (5,3):\n- Next turn, my body will be at (4,3) and (4,4). From (5,3), possible moves: UP to (5,4) [empty], DOWN to (5,2) [empty], LEFT to (4,3) [my body - unsafe], RIGHT to (6,3) [empty]. So three safe moves. This moves toward the apple at (7,2) but also toward the enemy at (7,4).\n\nThe enemy snake #0 is at (7,4) with no body and 0 apples. They might move toward the apple at (7,2) or (3,8). Moving RIGHT puts me on a path that could intersect with them if they move down/left. Given my lead (2 apples vs. 0), I should avoid unnecessary risk and focus on securing the dense apple cluster in the lower-left, which is far from the enemy.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Continue heading toward the lower-left apple cluster. My immediate target is the apple at (2,2). From (4,3), both DOWN and LEFT reduce the Manhattan distance equally to 2. However, moving DOWN to (4,2) sets me up for a potential direct path: next turn I could go LEFT to (3,2) to get even closer to (2,2) (distance 1). Moving LEFT to (3,3) also works, but then I'd need to go DOWN to (3,2) next to reach the same distance. Both are equally good. I'll choose DOWN to maintain a vertical body alignment and keep options open.\n\nDOWN",

Candidate Moves for S0 (7, 3)\n\nWe need to move onto (7, 2) to eat $A_4$.\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check | M to $A_4(7, 2)$ | Status |\n| :--: | :----------: | :-------------: | :--------------: | :----: |\n| UP | (7, 4) | Safe (Empty) | 2 | Worse |\n| DOWN | (7, 2) | EAT $A_4$ | 0 | Optimal |\n| LEFT | (6, 3) | Safe (Empty) | 2 | Worse |\n| RIGHT | (8, 3) | Safe (Empty) | 2 | Worse |\n\nThe optimal move is **DOWN** to (7, 2).\n\n### 4. Immediate Death and Collision Check (S0 moving to (7, 2))\n\n1.  **Off-Board:** (7, 2) is safe.\n2.  **Self-Collision:** Snake length 1, no risk.\n3.  **Enemy Body Collision:** S1 Body: (4, 3), (4, 4). (7, 2) is safe.\n4.  **Head-on Collision:** S0 moves to (7, 2). S1 moves from (4, 2). Since they are highly separated, a head-on collision is impossible here.\n\nThe move DOWN is safe and results in $A_4$ capture.\n\n### 5. Prediction of Enemy 1's Move (4, 2)\n\nS1 is at (4, 2), length 3. S1 is highly likely to target $A_2(2, 2)$ (M=2).\n\n*   Target $A_2(2, 2)$:\n    *   LEFT to (3, 2): M to $A_2$ is 3. (Worse distance)\n    *   DOWN to (4, 1): M to $A_2$ is 3. (Worse distance)\n    *   UP to (4, 3): Hits body at (4, 3). **FATAL.**\n    *   RIGHT to (5, 2): M to $A_2$ is 5. (Worse distance)\n\nWait, all moves increase S1's distance to $A_2(2, 2)$. This is an unexpected difficulty for S1. Let's recheck the distances to $A_2$ from (4, 2):\n$|4-2| + |2-2| = 2$.\n\nCandidate moves from (4, 2):\n*   LEFT (3, 2): M to $A_2$ is $|3-2| + |2-2| = 1$. **(BEST: EAT next turn)**\n*   DOWN (4, 1): M to $A_2$ is $|4-2| + |1-2| = 3$. (Worse)\n*   UP (4, 3): Collides with body. (Fatal)\n*   RIGHT (5, 2): M to $A_2$ is 5. (Worse)\n\nThus, S1 will almost certainly move **LEFT** to (3, 2) to prepare for eating $A_2$.\n\n### 6. Strategic Review\n\nS0 moves DOWN to (7, 2) and eats $A_4$.\nS1 moves LEFT to (3, 2).\n\nAfter this turn:\nS0: Head (7, 2), Body (7, 3). Length 2. Apples 1.\nS1: Head (3, 2), Body (4, 2), (4, 3). Length 4. Apples 2.\n\nThis move is optimal as it secures our first apple and keeps us safe.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** I captured $A_4(7, 2)$. Next turn (T10), S1 is likely to capture $A_2(2, 2)$. Current S0 position is (7, 2), length 2 (tail at (7, 3)). The remaining apples are $A_1(1, 1)$, $A_3(0, 3)$, $A_5(3, 8)$.\nThe closest remaining apple is $A_1(1, 1)$, M=7. The next closest is $A_3(0, 3)$, M=9. $A_5(3, 8)$ is M=6 (closer than $A_1$ and $A_3$).\nAfter eating $A_4$: S0 Head (7, 2).\n$A_5(3, 8)$: $|7-3| + |2-8| = 4 + 6 = 10$.\n$A_1(1, 1)$: $|7-1| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7$.\n$A_3(0, 3)$: $|7-0| + |2-3| = 7 + 1 = 8$.\n\nThe next target is $A_1(1, 1)$ (M=7). Strategy should be to move LEFT towards the center of the board to capture $A_1$ or $A_3$.\n\nMove chosen: DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

Game State Analysis\n\n*   **Board Size:** 10x10 (0,0 to 9,9).\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):** Head previously at (7, 3), moved DOWN to (7, 2) and consumed an apple.\n    *   New Head: (7, 2).\n    *   Body: [(7, 3)].\n    *   Length: 2 segments. Apples collected: 1. (Note: The provided input state seems to already reflect the results of the *last* turn (Turn 9). I will proceed using the current state provided.)\n*   **Current S0 State (ID 0):** Head at (7, 2). Body: [(7, 3)]. Total Length: 2. Apples: 1.\n*   **Enemy Snake 1 (ID 1):** Head at (3, 2). Body: [(4, 2), (4, 3)]. Total Length: 3. Apples: 2. (Assuming S1 moved LEFT from (4, 2) to (3, 2) as predicted in the last rationale, and its tail at (4, 4) was popped).\n    *   If S1 ate an apple, its body would be [(4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)].\n    *   *Correction based on provided body:* The opponent's body list `[(4, 2), (4, 3)]` suggests it did *not* eat an apple (no tail retention), and it moved LEFT from (4, 2) to (3, 2). Tail (4, 4) was popped. This confirms the movement prediction.\n*   **Apples remaining:** $A_1(1, 1)$, $A_2(2, 2)$, $A_3(0, 3)$, $A_4(3, 8)$, $A_5(6, 5)$. (The apple at (7, 2) was consumed).\n\n### 2. Identifying Targets and Distances\n\nMy Snake Head (S0): (7, 2).\nEnemy Snake 1 Head (S1): (3, 2).\n\n| Apple | Position | S0 Distance (M) | S1 Distance (M) | S1 Threat Level |\n| :---: | :------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :---: |\n| $A_2$ | (2, 2) | $|7-2| + |2-2| = 5$ | $|3-2| + |2-2| = 1$ | **Immediate Capture** (S1 is 1 step away) |\n| $A_5$ | (6, 5) | $|7-6| + |2-5| = 4$ | $|3-6| + |2-5| = 6$ | Low |\n| $A_1$ | (1, 1) | $|7-1| + |2-1| = 7$ | $|3-1| + |2-1| = 3$ | Medium |\n| $A_3$ | (0, 3) | $|7-0| + |2-3| = 8$ | $|3-0| + |2-3| = 4$ | Low |\n| $A_4$ | (3, 8) | $|7-3| + |2-8| = 10$ | $|3-3| + |2-8| = 6$ | Low |\n\n*   **Priority Target for S0:** $A_5(6, 5)$ is the closest apple (M=4).\n*   **S1 Action Prediction:** S1 is certainly moving LEFT to (2, 2) to eat $A_2$ (M=1).\n\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (7, 2)\n\nS0 must escape the corner and move towards $A_5(6, 5)$.\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check | M to $A_5(6, 5)$ | Status |\n| :--: | :----------: | :-------------: | :--------------: | :----: |\n| UP | (7, 3) | Hits own body [(7, 3)]. | **FATAL** | Death |\n| DOWN | (7, 1) | Safe (Empty) | 5 | Worse direction |\n| LEFT | (6, 2) | Safe (Empty) | 3 | Good |\n| RIGHT | (8, 2) | Safe (Empty) | 5 | Worse direction |\n\n**Wait, critical collision:** Moving UP to (7, 3) hits the body segment at (7, 3) which is immediately behind the head. This is an immediate death condition.\n\nThe only movement that immediately improves distance to $A_5(6, 5)$ and respects safety is **LEFT** to (6, 2).\n\n### 4. Immediate Death and Collision Check (S0 moving to (6, 2))\n\n1.  **Off-Board:** (6, 2) is safe.\n2.  **Self-Collision:** (6, 2) is safe, body is at (7, 3).\n3.  **Enemy Body Collision:** S1 Body: (4, 2), (4, 3). (6, 2) is safe.\n4.  **Head-on Collision:** S0 moves to (6, 2). S1 moves to (2, 2). Safe.\n\nThe move LEFT is safe and leads toward the closest available apple $A_5(6, 5)$.\n\n### 5. Prediction of Enemy 1's Move (3, 2)\n\nS1 is at (3, 2), length 3. S1 will move LEFT to (2, 2) to eat $A_2$.\n\n*   S1 moves LEFT to (2, 2).\n    *   S1 Head: (2, 2).\n    *   S1 Body: (3, 2), (4, 2). (Tail (4, 3) is retained because S1 eats $A_2$).\n    *   S1 Length: 4. Apples: 3.\n\n### 6. Strategic Review\n\nS0 moves **LEFT** to (6, 2). M to $A_5(6, 5)$ is 3.\nS1 moves LEFT to (2, 2) and consumes $A_2$.\n\nAfter this turn:\nS0: Head (6, 2), Body (7, 2). Length 2. Apples 1.\nS1: Head (2, 2), Body (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3). Length 4. Apples 3.\n\nS1 is pulling ahead significantly in length and apples. S0 must now prioritize eating $A_5(6, 5)$ (3 steps away), or attempt to intercept S1's path towards $A_1(1, 1)$.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self-Note):** S1 just ate $A_2(2, 2)$. S1 is likely now targeting $A_1(1, 1)$, which is M=2 away from S1's new head position (2, 2). S1 will likely move DOWN to (2, 1) then LEFT to (1, 1) next turn. S0 must capture $A_5(6, 5)$ (M=3) quickly.\n\nT11 Plan: S0 moves UP to (6, 3) (M=2 to $A_5$). S1 moves DOWN to (2, 1) (M=1 to $A_1$).\nT12 Plan: S0 moves UP to (6, 4) (M=1 to $A_5$). S1 moves LEFT to (1, 1) and eats $A_1$ (M=0).\n\nIt appears S1 will capture $A_1$ before S0 captures $A_5$.\n\nS0 Sequence to A5 (6, 5): (7, 2) -> (6, 2) -> (6, 3) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 5) (4 turns total to eat).\nS1 Sequence to A1 (1, 1): (3, 2) -> (2, 2) (Eat A2) -> (2, 1) -> (1, 1) (Eat A1) (3 turns total).\n\nThe immediate priority for S0 is to safely reach $A_5(6, 5)$.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current board, my head is at (3,2) with body at [(4,2), (4,3)]. Apples are at (1,1), (2,2), (0,3), (3,8), (6,5). Enemy snake #0 is at (7,2) with body at [(7,3)].\n\nFirst, check each move for immediate death:\n\n- **UP** to (3,3): Within board (0-9). Not occupied by my body or enemy. Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (3,1): Within board. Not occupied by my body or enemy. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (2,2): Within board. There is an apple at (2,2). Moving onto an apple is safe (I eat it and grow). Not occupied by any snake body. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (4,2): That's my own body segment at (4,2). Moving into my own body kills me. So RIGHT is **not safe**.\n\nSo safe moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\nNow evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.\n\nFrom head (3,2):\n- **UP** to (3,3): Moves away from the lower-left apple cluster (1,1), (2,2). Distance to (2,2) increases from 1 to 2. Moves toward apple at (0,3) (distance from 3 to 2? Actually from (3,2) to (0,3) is |3-0|+|2-3|=3+1=4, to (3,3) to (0,3) is |3-0|+|3-3|=3+0=3, so improves). Also moves toward (3,8) but far.\n- **DOWN** to (3,1): Moves toward apple at (1,1) (distance reduces from |3-1|+|2-1|=2+1=3 to |3-1|+|1-1|=2+0=2). Moves away from (2,2) (distance increases from 1 to |3-2|+|1-2|=1+1=2).\n- **LEFT** to (2,2): This directly eats the apple at (2,2). Immediate growth and score increase to 3 apples.\n\nEating the apple at (2,2) is highly advantageous. It increases my lead (3 vs enemy's 1) and removes that apple from the board. After eating, my snake will grow: new head at (2,2), body becomes [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3)] (tail stays at (4,3) since growth adds segment at tail next turn? Actually in standard snake, when you eat an apple, you grow by adding a new segment at the tail position at the end of the move. So next turn my body will be longer, but the tail cell remains occupied. For move safety checking now, moving onto the apple is safe because the apple is not a body cell.\n\nConsider future move options after each choice:\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (2,2) and eat the apple:\n- Next turn, my body will be: head at (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3). From (2,2), possible moves: UP to (2,3) [empty], DOWN to (2,1) [empty], LEFT to (1,2) [empty], RIGHT to (3,2) [my body - unsafe]. So three safe moves. I'll be adjacent to apple at (1,1) and (0,3).\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (3,1):\n- Next turn, body: head at (3,1), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3). From (3,1), moves: UP to (3,2) [my body - unsafe], DOWN to (3,0) [empty], LEFT to (2,1) [empty], RIGHT to (4,1) [empty]. So three safe moves. Still close to (1,1).\n\nIf I move **UP** to (3,3):\n- Next turn, body: head at (3,3), then (3,2), (4,2), (4,3). From (3,3), moves: UP to (3,4) [empty], DOWN to (3,2) [my body - unsafe], LEFT to (2,3) [empty], RIGHT to (4,3) [my body - unsafe]. So only two safe moves (UP, LEFT). This reduces future options.\n\nAlso consider enemy snake #0 at (7,2) with body at (7,3). They might move toward apple at (6,5) or (3,8). They are far from me, so low risk of collision this turn.\n\n**Long-term plan:** After eating the apple at (2,2), I'll have 3 apples vs enemy's 1. I should then target the remaining apples in the lower-left: (1,1) and (0,3). From (2,2), moving DOWN to (2,1) gets closer to (1,1), and moving UP to (2,3) gets closer to (0,3). I'll assess next turn. Avoid moving toward the enemy or into tight spaces.\n\nLEFT is the best move because it secures an apple immediately, increases my lead, and keeps good future options.\n\nLEFT",

The current list reflects the new apple setup.)\n\nThe board map provided is slightly different from what the previous rationale assumed:\n```\n 9 . . . . . . A . . .  <- A5 (6, 9)\n 8 . . .

This is fatal.\n\nThe safe and optimal move is **UP** to (6, 3), reducing distance to $A_4(6, 5)$ to M=2.\n\n### 4. Immediate Death and Collision Check (S0 moving to (6, 3))\n\n1.  **Off-Board:** (6, 3) is safe.\n2.  **Self-Collision:** Safe.

Enemy snake #0's head is at (6,2) with body [(7,2)].\n\n**Step 1: Check each direction for immediate death.**\n\n- **UP** to (2,3): Within board (0-9). Not occupied by my body or enemy body.

Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (3,2): That's my own body segment at (3,2). Moving into my own body kills me. **RIGHT is NOT safe.**\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**\n\nFrom head (2,2):\n- **UP** to (2,3): Distance to apple at (0,3) is |2-0|+|3-3|=2. Moves away from apple at (1,1) (distance from 2 to 3? From (2,2) to (1,1) is 2, from (2,3) to (1,1) is 3). Also moves toward apple at (3,8) but very far.\n- **DOWN** to (2,1): Distance to apple at (1,1) is |2-1|+|1-1|=1. This is the closest move to any apple.\n- **LEFT** to (1,2): Distance to apple at (1,1) is |1-1|+|2-1|=1. Also distance to apple at (0,3) is |1-0|+|2-3|=1+1=2.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (2,1) and eat apple (1,1) next turn? No, (1,1) is not at (2,1). But I'd be adjacent to it. After moving DOWN, my body becomes: head (2,1), then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (4,3) (since I have 3 apples, my length is 4 segments? Wait, I have collected 3 apples, so my snake length should be initial length + apples eaten. Starting length is 3 segments (head + 2 body). I've eaten 3 apples, so total length should be 6 segments. But the board only shows 4 segments: head (2,2) and body [(3,2), (4,2), (4,3)]. That suggests the display might not show the full grown tail yet, or growth is pending. I'll assume my current visible body is accurate for collision checking. After a move without eating, my tail will move and length stays the same. So after moving DOWN, my body would be: head (2,1), then (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) (tail at (4,2) if tail moves from (4,3)? Actually standard snake: head moves forward, each body segment moves into the previous segment's position, tail moves forward. So new body: [(2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]. From (2,1), possible moves: UP to (2,2) [my body - unsafe], DOWN to (2,0) [empty], LEFT to (1,1) [apple - safe to eat], RIGHT to (3,1) [empty]. So three safe moves, one leads directly to an apple.\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (1,2): New body: [(1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]. From (1,2), moves: UP to (1,3) [empty], DOWN to (1,1) [apple - safe to eat], LEFT to (0,2) [empty], RIGHT to (2,2) [my body - unsafe]. Three safe moves, one leads directly to an apple (1,1).\n\nIf I move **UP** to (2,3): New body: [(2,3), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2)]. From (2,3), moves: UP to (2,4) [empty], DOWN to (2,2) [my body - unsafe], LEFT to (1,3) [empty], RIGHT to (3,3) [empty]. Three safe moves, but no immediate apple adjacency.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential head-on collisions.**\n\nEnemy head at (6,2). Their possible moves: UP to (6,3), DOWN to (6,1), LEFT to (5,2), RIGHT to (7,2) [their own body - unsafe]. They are far from me (Manhattan distance 4 from my head). No risk of head-on collision this turn regardless of my move. They might move toward apples at (6,5) or (6,9).\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan.**\n\nI have a lead (3 apples vs 1). I should secure more apples in my vicinity: (1,1) and (0,3). Moving DOWN or LEFT both put me adjacent to (1,1) for next turn. Moving DOWN seems slightly better because from (2,1) I can go LEFT to (1,1) to eat it, and still have DOWN to (2,0) or RIGHT to (3,1) as escape. Moving LEFT to (1,2) also lets me go DOWN to (1,1) next turn. Both are good.\n\nHowever, moving DOWN might slightly box me in the bottom edge if I'm not careful later. But it's safe now.\n\nI'll choose **DOWN** to get closest to the apple at (1,1) and set up to eat it next turn.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (2,1), if apple (1,1) is still there, consider moving LEFT to eat it. Otherwise, assess safety and move toward (0,3) or other apples while keeping options open.\n\nDOWN",

Eating the apple at (1,1) now increases my lead and grows my snake, making me longer but also giving me more control of space. Moving LEFT to eat it is safe and leaves me with three safe follow\u2011up moves. Moving DOWN or RIGHT reduces future options and doesn\u2019t gain an apple.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating (1,1), I\u2019ll be at (1,1) with apple (0,3) nearby. I should consider moving UP or LEFT toward (0,3) while avoiding boxing myself. Keep an eye on enemy #0, which is still far away.\n\nLEFT",

Body is at (6, 3).\n3.  **Enemy Body Collision:** S1 Body: (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2). (6, 5) is safe.\n4.  **Head-on Collision Prediction:**\n    *   H1 is at (1, 1). To reach (6, 5), H1 would need to traverse 9 units. Impossible in one move.\n\nThe move UP is safe and optimal for capturing the apple.\n\n### 5. Prediction of Enemy 1's Move (1, 1)\n\nH1 (1, 1) has targets $A_1(0, 3)$ (M=3), $A_2(3, 8)$ (M=9).\n\nH1 is long (length 5) and low. $A_1(0, 3)$ is the only nearby apple.\n\nH1 may move:\n1.  **UP** to (1, 2).

Both moves are safe for S1 (no self-collision, no board edge collision). Moving UP (increasing Y) keeps options open better than moving LEFT (hitting 0 X boundary quickly).\n\n*Prediction: S1 moves UP to (1, 2).*\n\n### 6. Strategic Review\n\nS0 moves UP and eats $A_3(6, 5)$. S0 Length 3, Apples 2.\nS1 likely moves UP to (1, 2).

The next best apple for S0 is $A_4(6, 9)$ (M=4 directly UP).\n\nLong-Term Plan (Self-Note):\nT14: S0 is at (6, 5) and targets $A_4(6, 9)$. Move UP.\nS1 is likely at (1, 2) and targets $A_1(0, 3)$.

Moving into my own body kills me. **RIGHT is NOT safe.**\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**  \nApples at: (0,3), (3,8), (6,5), (6,9), (4,8).\n\nFrom (1,1):\n- **UP** to (1,2): Manhattan distance to nearest apple (0,3) = |1-0|+|2-3| = 1+1=2.\n- **DOWN** to (1,0): Distance to nearest apple (0,3) = |1-0|+|0-3| = 1+3=4. Farther.\n- **LEFT** to (0,1): Distance to apple (0,3) = |0-0|+|1-3| = 0+2=2.\n\nAlso consider enemy snake #0 at head (6,4), body [(6,3)]. Manhattan distance from my head to enemy head: |1-6|+|1-4|=5+3=8. No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**  \n\nIf I move **UP** to (1,2):  \nNew body: head (1,2), then (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2) (length 6, no growth unless apple at (1,2) \u2014 none).  \nFrom (1,2), possible moves:  \n- UP to (1,3): empty.  \n- DOWN to (1,1): my body (unsafe).  \n- LEFT to (0,2): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (2,2): my body (unsafe).  \nSo two safe moves (UP, LEFT). That\u2019s okay, and UP leads toward apple (0,3).\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (1,0):  \nNew body: head (1,0), then (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2).  \nFrom (1,0):  \n- UP to (1,1): my body (unsafe).  \n- DOWN to (1,-1): off board (unsafe).  \n- LEFT to (0,0): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (2,0): empty.  \nSo two safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT). Downside: I\u2019m near bottom edge, fewer options, and farther from apples.\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (0,1):  \nNew body: head (0,1), then (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,2).  \nFrom (0,1):  \n- UP to (0,2): empty.  \n- DOWN to (0,0): empty.  \n- LEFT to (-1,1): off board (unsafe).  \n- RIGHT to (1,1): my body (unsafe).  \nSo two safe moves (UP, DOWN). Moving LEFT puts me at left edge, but apple (0,3) is two steps up.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential head\u2011on collisions.**  \nEnemy #0 head at (6,4). It could move UP to (6,5) (apple), DOWN to (6,3) (its own body \u2014 unsafe?), wait its body is at (6,3) \u2014 so DOWN into its own body would kill it. So enemy likely moves UP to (6,5) to eat apple, or LEFT/RIGHT if safe. No direct collision risk with me this turn.\n\n**Step 5: Long\u2011term plan.**  \nI have a lead (4 apples vs 1). I want to safely collect more apples while keeping future options open. Moving UP to (1,2) gives me two safe moves next turn and brings me closer to apple (0,3). Moving LEFT also brings me closer but leaves me on the edge with two safe moves. UP seems slightly better because from (1,2) I can go UP to (1,3) or LEFT to (0,2) \u2014 both approach (0,3). Also, moving UP avoids the bottom edge trap.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving UP to (1,2), aim for apple (0,3) by going UP then LEFT, or LEFT then UP, while checking for enemy movement. Keep an eye on enemy #0, which may grow if it eats apple at (6,5). Maintain space by not boxing myself in corners.\n\nUP",

Identifying Targets and Distances\n\nH0 (6, 5).\nH1 (1, 2).\n\n| Apple | Position | H0 Distance (M) | H1 Distance (M) | Competition Score (H0-H1) |\n| :---: | :------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :---: |\n| $A_1$ | (0, 3) | $|6-0| + |5-3| = 8$ | $|1-0| + |2-3| = 2$ | +6 (H1 far closer) |\n| $A_2$ | (3, 8) | $|6-3| + |5-8| = 6$ | $|1-3| + |2-8| = 8$ | -2 (H0 closer) |\n| $A_3$ | (6, 9) | $|6-6| + |5-9| = 4$ | $|1-6| + |2-9| = 12$ | -8 (H0 much closer) |\n| $A_4$ | (4, 8) | $|6-4| + |5-8| = 5$ | $|1-4| + |2-8| = 9$ | -4 (H0 closer) |\n| $A_5$ | (3, 0) | $|6-3| + |5-0| = 8$ | $|1-3| + |2-0| = 4$ | +4 (H1 closer) |\n\n**Immediate Target for H0:** $A_3(6, 9)$ is closest at M=4, and directly accessible via UP moves. $A_4(4, 8)$ (M=5) and $A_2(3, 8)$ (M=6) are secondary targets requiring Left/Up movement.\n\n**Immediate Target for H1:** $A_1(0, 3)$ is closest at M=2. $A_5(3, 0)$ is next at M=4.\n\nWe must secure $A_3$ before anyone else can reach it.\n\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (6, 5)\n\nThe path to $A_3(6, 9)$ is straight UP.\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check | M to $A_3(6, 9)$ | Path Status |\n| :--: | :----------: | :-------------: | :--------------: | :---: |\n| UP | (6, 6) | Safe (Empty) | 3 | Optimal |\n| DOWN | (6, 4) | Hits own body [(6, 4)] | 5 | FATAL (Moving backwards) |\n| LEFT | (5, 5) | Safe (Empty) | 5 | Slower |\n| RIGHT | (7, 5) | Safe (Empty) | 5 | Slower |\n\nMoving **UP** to (6, 6) is the clear optimal choice for continuing towards $A_3$.\n\n### 4. Immediate Death and Collision Check (S0 moving to (6, 6))\n\n1.  **Off-Board:** (6, 6) is safe.\n2.  **Self-Collision:** Safe. The body is at (6, 4) and (6, 3).\n3.  **Enemy Body Collision:** S1 Body: (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2). (6, 6) is safe.\n4.  **Head-on Collision Prediction:** H1 is at (1, 2). H0 is moving to (6, 6). Safe distance.\n\nThe move UP is safe and optimal.\n\n### 5. Prediction of Enemy 1's Move (1, 2)\n\nH1 (1, 2) is 2 moves away from $A_1(0, 3)$. Possible safe moves for H1:\n\n1.  **UP** to (1, 3). (Path to $A_1$: (1, 3) -> (0, 3). Needs 2 moves total if H1 moves LEFT next turn.)\n2.  **LEFT** to (0, 2). (Path to $A_1$: (0, 2) -> (0, 3). Needs 2 moves total.)\n3.  **RIGHT** to (2, 2). (Hits its own body segment (2, 2). FATAL if body length > 1, but H1 only has 5 segments, the tail (3, 2) will vacate the position (4, 2) in the next round. Hmm, wait. H1 Body: [(1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2)]. The tail is (3, 2). The cell (2, 2) is a *middle segment* of the body. Moving RIGHT to (2, 2) is illegal.)\n4.  **DOWN** to (1, 1). (Hits its own body segment (1, 1). FATAL/Backwards move.)\n\nThus, H1 must choose between UP (1, 3) and LEFT (0, 2) to pursue $A_1(0, 3)$. Both moves allow H1 to reach $A_1$ in 2 moves (if optimal follow-up is chosen).\n\n*   If H1 moves LEFT to (0, 2), it hugs the edge. Next move: UP to (0, 3) (Eat).\n*   If H1 moves UP to (1, 3), it is equidistant to (0, 3) and (2, 3), keeping more options. Next move: LEFT to (0, 3) (Eat).\n\nGiven the short length of the path (M=2), H1 will likely prioritize securing the apple quickly by moving **LEFT** to (0, 2), putting it in position to eat $A_1$ next turn.\n\n### 6. Strategic Review\n\nS0 moves UP to (6, 6), targeting $A_3(6, 9)$.\nS1 likely moves LEFT to (0, 2), targeting $A_1(0, 3)$.\n\nS1 is likely to eat $A_1$ on Turn 15. We must ensure we eat $A_3$ on Turn 18. Both sides secure their nearest apples without competition. Since H1 is currently winning 4-2, we need to quickly secure more apples in the upper right quadrant. After $A_3$, we target $A_4(4, 8)$ (M=5 from (6, 6)) or $A_2(3, 8)$ (M=6 from (6, 6)).\n\n*Long-Term Strategy:* Secure $A_3(6, 9)$ (3 moves). Then secure $A_4(4, 8)$ and $A_2(3, 8)$ to dominate the top right.\n\nUP",

Not occupied by enemy #0\u2019s body (enemy body at (6,4),(6,3)). Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (1,1): That\u2019s my own body segment (second segment). Moving into my own body kills me. **DOWN is NOT safe.**\n- **LEFT** to (0,2): Within board. Not my body, not enemy body. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,2): That\u2019s my own body segment (fourth segment). **RIGHT is NOT safe.**\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**  \nApples at: (0,3), (3,8), (6,9), (4,8), (3,0).\n\nFrom (1,2):\n- **UP** to (1,3): Manhattan distance to nearest apple (0,3) = |1\u20110| + |3\u20113| = 1+0 = 1. Very close.\n- **LEFT** to (0,2): Distance to apple (0,3) = |0\u20110| + |2\u20113| = 0+1 = 1. Also very close.\n\nBoth moves put me one step away from apple (0,3).  \nApple (0,3) is reachable next turn from either (1,3) or (0,2).\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**  \n\nIf I move **UP** to (1,3):  \nNew body (no growth): head (1,3), then (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2).  \nFrom (1,3) next turn:  \n- UP to (1,4): empty.  \n- DOWN to (1,2): my body (unsafe).  \n- LEFT to (0,3): apple (0,3) \u2013 eating it would grow me.  \n- RIGHT to (2,3): empty.  \nSo three safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). LEFT leads directly to the apple.\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (0,2):  \nNew body: head (0,2), then (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2).  \nFrom (0,2) next turn:  \n- UP to (0,3): apple (0,3) \u2013 eating it would grow me.  \n- DOWN to (0,1): empty.  \n- LEFT to (-1,2): off board (unsafe).  \n- RIGHT to (1,2): my body (unsafe).  \nSo two safe moves (UP, DOWN). UP leads directly to the apple.\n\nBoth moves give a safe path to the apple next turn, but moving UP now gives me three safe follow\u2011up moves, while moving LEFT gives only two (and puts me on the left edge). More options are better for avoiding traps later.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential head\u2011on collisions.**  \nEnemy #0 head at (6,5), body [(6,4),(6,3)].  \nEnemy\u2019s safe moves:  \n- UP to (6,6): empty.  \n- DOWN to (6,4): its own body (unsafe).  \n- LEFT to (5,5): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (7,5): empty.  \nSo enemy likely moves UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. No direct collision risk with me this turn (my head at (1,2) far away).  \nIf enemy moves UP to (6,6), it moves farther from apples (3,8),(6,9),(4,8). It might aim for (6,9) later.  \nI have a lead (4 apples vs 2). My priority is to safely collect apple (0,3) while maintaining flexibility.\n\n**Step 5: Long\u2011term plan.**  \nAfter eating apple (0,3), I\u2019ll be longer (7 segments). I should then aim for the cluster of apples at (3,8),(4,8),(6,9) by moving rightward and upward, while keeping an eye on enemy #0\u2019s position. Avoid getting boxed in the left side. Since I have more apples, I can play conservatively\u2014choose moves that keep multiple safe exits.\n\nMoving UP now gives me more options next turn and still leaves the apple one step away. Moving LEFT also reaches the apple next turn but reduces my immediate options. Therefore, UP is slightly better for maintaining maneuverability.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,3), move LEFT to (0,3) to eat the apple, unless something unexpected happens (e.g., enemy suddenly appears nearby). After eating, assess safe directions to start moving toward the upper\u2011right apple cluster while avoiding my own growing tail.\n\nUP",

Candidate Moves for S0 (6, 6)\n\nThe path to $A_3(6, 9)$ is straight UP.\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check | M to $A_3(6, 9)$ | Safety/Status |\n| :--: | :----------: | :-------------: | :--------------: | :---: |\n| UP | (6, 7) | Safe (Empty) | 2 | Optimal for $A_3$ |\n| DOWN | (6, 5) | Hits own body [(6, 5)] | 4 | FATAL (Moving backwards) |\n| LEFT | (5, 6) | Safe (Empty) | 4 | Slower |\n| RIGHT | (7, 6) | Safe (Empty) | 4 | Slower |\n\nMoving **UP** to (6, 7) is the safest and most efficient path towards $A_3$.\n\n### 4. Immediate Death and Collision Check (S0 moving to (6, 7))\n\n1.  **Off-Board:** (6, 7) is safe.\n2.  **Self-Collision:** Safe. The body is at (6, 5) and (6, 4).\n3.  **Enemy Body Collision:** S1 Body: (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2). (6, 7) is safe.\n4.  **Head-on Collision Prediction:**\n    H1 is at (1, 3). H0 moves to (6, 7). No intersection possible.\n\nThe move UP is safe and optimal.\n\n### 5. Prediction of Enemy 1's Move (1, 3)\n\nH1 (1, 3) is M=1 away from $A_1(0, 3)$.\n\nPossible safe moves for H1 (Body: [(1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2)]):\n\n1.  **UP** to (1, 4). (M=2 to $A_1$. Bad move.)\n2.  **DOWN** to (1, 2). (Hits its own segment (1, 2). FATAL/Backwards move.)\n3.  **LEFT** to (0, 3). (Eats $A_1$. Best move.)\n4.  **RIGHT** to (2, 3). (M=2 to $A_1$. Bad move.)\n\nH1 will move **LEFT** to (0, 3) and score an apple, increasing its lead to 5-2. Our focus remains on securing $A_3$ to minimize the damage.\n\n### 6. Strategic Review\n\nOur strategy continues to be securing $A_3$, then pivoting to $A_4$ and $A_2$ to dominate the upper right quadrant while H1 cleans up the lower left.\n\n*Long-Term Strategy Note:* We must secure $A_3(6, 9)$ (2 more moves). After $A_3$, evaluate $A_4(4, 8)$ (M=4 from (6, 9)) versus $A_2(3, 8)$ (M=5 from (6, 9)). Priority remains on apples H1 cannot easily reach.\n\nUP",

My body (head\u2011to\u2011tail) is: [(1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2)].  \nCheck moves from (1,3):\n\n- **UP** to (1,4): Within board (0\u20119). Not occupied by my body. Not occupied by enemy #0\u2019s body (enemy body at (6,5),(6,4)). Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (1,2): That\u2019s my own body segment (second segment). Moving into my own body kills me. **DOWN is NOT safe.**\n- **LEFT** to (0,3): Apple at (0,3) \u2013 eating it would grow me. Within board. Not my body, not enemy body. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,3): Within board. Not my body, not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**  \nApples at: (0,3), (3,8), (6,9), (4,8), (3,0).  \nFrom (1,3):\n- **UP** to (1,4): Manhattan distance to nearest apple (0,3) = |1-0| + |4-3| = 1+1 = 2. Also distance to (3,8) is large.\n- **LEFT** to (0,3): Directly onto apple (0,3) \u2013 eat it and grow.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,3): Distance to nearest apple (0,3) = |2-0| + |3-3| = 2+0 = 2. Also distance to (3,0) = |2-3| + |3-0| = 1+3 = 4.\n\nLEFT is clearly best for immediate apple collection.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**  \n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (0,3) and eat the apple:  \nNew body (with growth): head (0,3), then (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2). Length becomes 7.  \nFrom (0,3) next turn:  \n- UP to (0,4): empty.  \n- DOWN to (0,2): empty.  \n- LEFT to (-1,3): off board (unsafe).  \n- RIGHT to (1,3): my body (unsafe).  \nSo two safe moves (UP, DOWN). I\u2019ll be on the left edge, but with two exits.\n\nIf I move **UP** to (1,4):  \nNew body (no growth): head (1,4), then (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2).  \nFrom (1,4) next turn: likely safe moves UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN into body). More options, but no apple eaten.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (2,3):  \nNew body (no growth): head (2,3), then (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2).  \nFrom (2,3) next turn: safe moves likely UP, DOWN, RIGHT (LEFT into body). Also no apple.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential head\u2011on collisions.**  \nEnemy #0 head at (6,6), body [(6,5),(6,4)].  \nEnemy\u2019s safe moves from (6,6):  \n- UP to (6,7): empty.  \n- DOWN to (6,5): its own body (unsafe).  \n- LEFT to (5,6): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (7,6): empty.  \nEnemy likely moves UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. It is far away (distance 5 in x, 3 in y). No direct collision risk this turn.\n\n**Step 5: Long\u2011term plan.**  \nEating apple (0,3) now gives me 5 apples vs enemy\u2019s 2, extending my lead. After eating, I\u2019ll be longer, so I need to plan an escape from the left edge. From (0,3) after eating, I can move UP to (0,4) or DOWN to (0,2). I should choose the direction that opens a path toward the upper\u2011right apple cluster (3,8),(4,8),(6,9) while avoiding boxing myself. Moving UP seems better to start heading toward that cluster.\n\nGiven the clear advantage of eating the apple now and the low risk (enemy far away), LEFT is the best move.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple (0,3), move UP to (0,4) to start moving toward the upper\u2011right apple cluster, unless DOWN offers a safer path (check body positions then). Keep an eye on enemy #0\u2019s movement toward apples (3,8),(4,8),(6,9). Maintain my apple lead while avoiding dead\u2011ends.\n\nLEFT",

Immediate Death and Collision Check (S0 moving to (6, 8))\n\n1.  **Off-Board:** (6, 8) is safe.\n2.  **Self-Collision:** Safe. The body is at (6, 6) and (6, 5).\n3.  **Enemy Body Collision:** S1 Body: (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2). (6, 8) is safe.\n4.  **Head-on Collision Prediction:**\n    H1 is at (0, 3). H0 moves to (6, 8). No intersection possible.\n\nThe move UP is safe and optimal.\n\n### 5. Prediction of Enemy 1's Move (0, 3)\n\nH1 is now at (0, 3) and has length 6. It has three primary targets it might pursue next: $A_4(3, 0)$ (M=6), $A_5(5, 3)$ (M=5), or a movement to open space.\n\nPossible safe moves for H1 (Body: [(1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2)]):\n\n1.  **UP** to (0, 4). (Move towards open board space.)\n2.  **DOWN** to (0, 2). (Moves away from open space, potentially bottling itself up, but opens path to $A_4(3, 0)$.)\n3.  **LEFT** to (-1, 3). (FATAL - Off board)\n4.  **RIGHT** to (1, 3). (Hits its own segment (1, 3). FATAL/Backwards move.)\n\nH1 has a limited number of safe options: (0, 4) UP or (0, 2) DOWN.\n\n*   If H1 moves **UP** to (0, 4): H1 moves into open space. M to $A_5$: 5.\n*   If H1 moves **DOWN** to (0, 2): H1 has M=1 to wall/border. M to $A_4$: 5.\n\nThe most strategically sound move for H1 is likely **UP** to (0, 4) to maintain flexibility, or **DOWN** to (0, 2) to target the apple at (3, 0). Since H1 has been very aggressive on apples, expecting **DOWN** towards the nearest apple $A_4(3, 0)$ is reasonable.\n\nCrucially, neither predicted move for H1 affects our move to (6, 8).\n\n### 6. Strategic Review\n\nContinue path to $A_1(6, 9)$. This will narrow the score gap to 5-3. After securing $A_1$, the next target priority will be $A_3(4, 8)$ (M=2 away) or $A_2(3, 8)$ (M=3 away).\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:**\nTurn 17: Move UP to (6, 9) to secure Apple $A_1$.

Distance to (5,3) = 5+1 = 6.\n\nBoth are far from apples, but DOWN is slightly closer to (3,0).\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**  \n\nIf I move **UP** to (0,4):  \nNew body (no growth): head (0,4), then (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2).  \nFrom (0,4) next turn:  \n- UP to (0,5): empty.  \n- DOWN to (0,3): my body (unsafe).  \n- LEFT off board.  \n- RIGHT to (1,4): empty.  \nSo safe moves: UP, RIGHT. That gives two exits, with UP continuing along edge, RIGHT moving inward.\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (0,2):  \nNew body (no growth): head (0,2), then (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2).  \nFrom (0,2) next turn:  \n- UP to (0,3): my body (unsafe).  \n- DOWN to (0,1): empty.  \n- LEFT off board.  \n- RIGHT to (1,2): my body (unsafe).  \nSo only safe move: DOWN. That\u2019s a dead-end next turn\u2014I\u2019d be forced to continue DOWN to (0,1), then (0,0), and then possibly trapped.\n\nThus UP is far superior because it keeps two safe moves next turn, while DOWN forces me into a corridor with only one safe move.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential head\u2011on collisions.**  \nEnemy #0 head at (6,7), body [(6,6),(6,5)].  \nEnemy\u2019s safe moves from (6,7):  \n- UP to (6,8): empty.  \n- DOWN to (6,6): its own body (unsafe).  \n- LEFT to (5,7): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (7,7): empty.  \nEnemy is far away (distance 6 in x, 4 in y). No direct collision risk this turn. Enemy may move toward apples (3,8),(4,8),(6,9). I should start heading that way as well.\n\n**Step 5: Long\u2011term plan.**  \nI need to escape the left edge and navigate toward the apple cluster in the upper-right. Moving UP to (0,4) gives me options to go RIGHT next turn to (1,4), then gradually work my way toward (3,8) etc. Avoid getting trapped in the bottom-left corner. Also, keep an eye on enemy #0\u2019s path to those apples\u2014I may need to intercept or take a different route if it gets too close.\n\nGiven the analysis, UP is the only safe move that maintains future flexibility. DOWN leads to a dead-end.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (0,4), I will likely move RIGHT to (1,4) to start moving inward toward the center/upper-right apples, unless enemy positioning suggests a risk. Continue to monitor enemy #0\u2019s movement toward apples (3,8),(4,8),(6,9). Maintain my apple lead (5 vs 2) by eventually reaching those apples safely.\n\nUP",

Immediate Death and Collision Check (S0 moving to (6, 9))\n\n1.  **Off-Board:** (6, 9) is safe.\n2.  **Self-Collision:** Safe. The body is at (6, 7) and (6, 6).\n3.  **Enemy Body Collision:** S1 Body: (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1). (6, 9) is safe.\n4.  **Head-on Collision Prediction:**\n    H1 is at (0, 4). H0 moves to (6, 9). No intersection possible.\n\nThe move UP is safe and optimal.\n\n### 5. Prediction of Enemy 1's Move (0, 4)\n\nH1 is at (0, 4) and has length 6. Its nearest targets are $A_E(5, 3)$ (M=6) and $A_D(3, 0)$ (M=7).\n\nPossible safe moves for H1 (Body: [(0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1)]):\n\n1.  **UP** to (0, 5). Safe. Moves towards open space. M to $A_E$: 6.\n2.  **DOWN** to (0, 3). Hits body segment (0, 3). FATAL (Moving backwards).\n3.  **LEFT** to (-1, 4). FATAL (Off board).\n4.  **RIGHT** to (1, 4). Safe. Moves towards $A_E$. M to $A_E$: 5.\n\nH1 will likely move **RIGHT** to (1, 4) as it reduces the Manhattan distance to the most competitive apple ($A_E$) and gives it the most maneuverability while still moving away from walls.\n\nRegardless of H1's move, our move UP to (6, 9) is safe.\n\n### 6. Strategic Review\n\nConsume the apple at (6, 9). Score gap narrows to 5-3.\n\nAfter capturing $(6, 9)$, our head will be at $(6, 9)$ and our tail will extend, making our new body [(6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6)].\nThe next best targets are $A_C(4, 8)$ (M=2) and $A_A(3, 8)$ (M=3). We should immediately target $A_C(4, 8)$ with a move LEFT.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:**\nTurn 17: Move UP to (6, 9) to secure Apple $A_B$. Score 3, Length 4.\nTurn 18: Move LEFT, targeting $A_C(4, 8)$. New head likely (5, 9). M to $A_C$ becomes $|5-4|+|9-8|=2$. This sets us up to secure $A_C$.\nTurn 19: Move DOWN or LEFT, depending on the precise path chosen to $A_C(4, 8)$.\n\nUP",

My body (head\u2011to\u2011tail) is: [(0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1)].  \nCheck moves from (0,4):\n\n- **UP** to (0,5): Within board (0\u20119). Not occupied by my body. Not occupied by enemy #0\u2019s body (enemy body at (6,7),(6,6)). Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (0,3): That\u2019s my own body segment (second segment). Moving into my own body kills me. **DOWN is NOT safe.**\n- **LEFT** to (-1,4): Off board (x < 0). **LEFT is NOT safe.**\n- **RIGHT** to (1,4): Within board. Not my body, not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**  \nApples at: (3,8), (6,9), (4,8), (3,0), (5,3).  \nFrom (0,4):\n- **UP** to (0,5): Manhattan distance to nearest apple (3,8) = |0-3| + |5-8| = 3+3 = 6. Distance to (4,8) = 4+3 = 7.\n- **RIGHT** to (1,4): Distance to nearest apple (5,3) = |1-5| + |4-3| = 4+1 = 5. Distance to (3,8) = 2+4 = 6.\n\nRIGHT is slightly closer to an apple (5,3), but UP is closer to the cluster at the top.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**  \n\nIf I move **UP** to (0,5):  \nNew body (no growth): head (0,5), then (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1).  \nFrom (0,5) next turn:  \n- UP to (0,6): empty.  \n- DOWN to (0,4): my body (unsafe).  \n- LEFT off board.  \n- RIGHT to (1,5): empty.  \nSo safe moves: UP, RIGHT. That maintains two exits, continuing along the left edge but with an option to go inward.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (1,4):  \nNew body (no growth): head (1,4), then (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (2,1).  \nFrom (1,4) next turn:  \n- UP to (1,5): empty.  \n- DOWN to (1,3): my body (unsafe).  \n- LEFT to (0,4): my body (unsafe).  \n- RIGHT to (2,4): empty.  \nSo safe moves: UP, RIGHT. That also gives two exits and moves me toward the center, which is better for accessing multiple apples.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential head\u2011on collisions.**  \nEnemy #0 head at (6,8), body [(6,7),(6,6)].  \nEnemy\u2019s safe moves from (6,8):  \n- UP to (6,9): apple at (6,9) \u2013 likely target.  \n- DOWN to (6,7): its own body (unsafe).  \n- LEFT to (5,8): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (7,8): empty.  \nEnemy is far away (distance 6 in x, 4 in y). No direct collision risk this turn. Enemy will likely move UP to eat the apple at (6,9) or LEFT toward (5,8). I should continue working toward the upper-right apple cluster while avoiding getting trapped.\n\n**Step 5: Long\u2011term plan.**  \nI need to escape the left edge. Moving RIGHT to (1,4) is better than UP because it starts moving me inward toward the center and the apples at (5,3) and (3,8). Staying on the left edge (UP) keeps me confined. From (1,4), I can go UP to (1,5) or RIGHT to (2,4) next turn, giving more options. My apple lead is 5 vs 2, so I can afford to maneuver safely rather than rush directly upward.\n\nGiven the analysis, RIGHT is the best move\u2014it\u2019s safe, moves me toward the center and apples, and maintains future flexibility.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,4), I will likely move UP to (1,5) to continue toward the upper apple cluster, unless enemy positioning suggests a risk. Keep monitoring enemy #0\u2019s movement toward apples (3,8),(4,8),(6,9). Maintain my apple lead by planning a safe route to the next apple.\n\nRIGHT",

Given our position at the top right, securing the apples in the top row seems highly feasible.\n\n**Priority Target:** $A_B(4, 8)$.\n\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (6, 9)\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check | M to $A_B(4, 8)$ | Safety/Status |\n| :--: | :----------: | :-------------: | :--------------: | :---: |\n| UP | (6, 10) | FATAL (Off board) | N/A | DEATH |\n| DOWN | (6, 8) | Hits own body [(6, 8)] | 3 | FATAL (Moving backwards) |\n| LEFT | (5, 9) | Safe (Empty) | 3 | Optimal path to $A_B$ |\n| RIGHT | (7, 9) | Safe (Empty) | 4 | Slower/Moves toward $A_E$ |\n\nMoving **LEFT** to (5, 9) is the only move that maintains maximum proximity to $A_B(4, 8)$ and $A_A(3, 8)$ without killing us. Moving RIGHT to (7, 9) increases the Manhattan distance to all three top apples ($A_A$, $A_B$, $A_E$).\n\n### 4. Immediate Death and Collision Check (S0 moving to (5, 9))\n\n1.  **Off-Board:** (5, 9) is safe.\n2.  **Self-Collision:** Body segments are (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6). (5, 9) is safe.\n3.  **Enemy Body Collision (S1 body: [(0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1)]):** (5, 9) is safe.\n4.  **Head-on Collision Prediction:** H1 is at (1, 4). H0 moves to (5, 9). No intersection possible.\n\nThe move LEFT is safe and maximizes our capture efficiency for the top-left apples.\n\n### 5. Prediction of Enemy 1's Move (1, 4)\n\nH1 is at (1, 4). Its body is [(0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1)].\nNearest competitive targets are $A_D(5, 3)$ (M=5) and $A_C(3, 0)$ (M=6).\n\nPossible safe moves for H1:\n1. **UP** to (1, 5). Safe. M to $A_D$: $|1-5| + |5-3| = 6$.\n2. **DOWN** to (1, 3). Hits body segment (1, 3). FATAL (Moving backwards).\n3. **LEFT** to (0, 4). Hits body segment (0, 4). FATAL.\n4. **RIGHT** to (2, 4). Safe. Moves towards $A_D$. M to $A_D$: $|2-5| + |4-3| = 4$.\n\nH1 will prioritize moving **RIGHT** to (2, 4) as it minimizes the distance to $A_D(5, 3)$, which H1 currently dominates. If H1 moves RIGHT, it also gets closer to $A_C(3, 0)$.\n\n### 6. Strategic Review\n\nOur move **LEFT** to (5, 9) positions us perfectly:\n*   **Turn 19:** Move DOWN to (5, 8). M to $A_B(4, 8)$ becomes 1.\n*   **Turn 20:** Move LEFT to (4, 8) to secure $A_B$.\n\nThis three-move sequence secures $A_B$, making the score 4-5. The primary risk is getting trapped, but the top boundary is wide open, and our body is clustered nicely at (6, 8) and below.\n\nThe alternative of moving RIGHT (to (7, 9)) towards $A_E(8, 7)$ is slower and doesn't secure the closest targets first. We will save $A_E$ for after $A_B$ and $A_A$.\n\nLEFT",

That gives three exits, good flexibility.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (2,4):  \nNew body (no growth): head (2,4), then (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1).  \nFrom (2,4) next turn:  \n- UP to (2,5): empty.  \n- DOWN to (2,3): empty.  \n- LEFT to (1,4): my body (unsafe).  \n- RIGHT to (3,4): empty.  \nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. That also gives three exits and moves me toward the center.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential head\u2011on collisions.**  \nEnemy #0 head at (6,9), body [(6,8),(6,7),(6,6)].  \nEnemy\u2019s safe moves from (6,9):  \n- UP: off board (y=10) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN to (6,8): its own body (unsafe).  \n- LEFT to (5,9): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (7,9): empty.  \nEnemy is far away (distance 5 in x, 5 in y). No direct collision risk this turn. Enemy will likely move LEFT toward (5,9) or RIGHT toward (7,9). The apple at (8,7) is somewhat near, but enemy is currently at the top edge.\n\n**Step 5: Long\u2011term plan.**  \nMy apple lead is 5 vs 3. I should aim to safely collect more apples while avoiding traps. Moving RIGHT to (2,4) positions me better to reach the apple at (5,3) and also opens a path upward toward (3,8) via (2,5) next. Moving UP to (1,5) keeps me closer to the top apples but leaves me on the left side, which is more confined. Given my body occupies the left column from y=1 to y=4, moving inward (RIGHT) gives me more space to maneuver and reduces the risk of being trapped against the left wall later.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2,4), I will likely move UP to (2,5) to start heading toward the apple cluster at (3,8)/(4,8), while keeping the option to go RIGHT toward (5,3) if needed. Monitor enemy #0's movement\u2014it is currently far and at the top edge, so it may move down toward the apples at (8,7) or (5,3) later.\n\nRIGHT",

Our previous move successfully positioned us for an imminent apple capture.\n\n### 2. Identifying Targets and Distances\n\nH0 is at (5, 9).\nH1 is predicted/observed at (2, 4).\n\n| Apple | Position | H0 Distance (M) | H1 Distance (M) | Competition Score (H0-H1) |\n| :---: | :------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :---: |\n| $A_B$ | (4, 8) | $|5-4| + |9-8| = 2$ | $|2-4| + |4-8| = 6$ | -4 (H0 dominant) |\n| $A_A$ | (3, 8) | $|5-3| + |9-8| = 3$ | $|2-3| + |4-8| = 5$ | -2 (H0 dominant) |\n| $A_E$ | (8, 7) | $|5-8| + |9-7| = 5$ | $|2-8| + |4-7| = 9$ | -4 (H0 dominant) |\n| $A_D$ | (5, 3) | $|5-5| + |9-3| = 6$ | $|2-5| + |4-3| = 4$ | +2 (H1 dominant) |\n| $A_C$ | (3, 0) | $|5-3| + |9-0| = 11$ | $|2-3| + |4-0| = 5$ | +6 (H1 dominant) |\n\n**Priority Target:** $A_B(4, 8)$ (M=2). We are perfectly positioned to grab this apple in the next two moves.\n\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (5, 9)\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check | M to $A_B(4, 8)$ | Safety/Status |\n| :--: | :----------: | :-------------: | :--------------: | :---: |\n| UP | (5, 10) | FATAL (Off board) | N/A | DEATH |\n| DOWN | (5, 8) | Safe (Empty) | 1 | Optimal path to $A_B$ |\n| LEFT | (4, 9) | Safe (Empty) | 2 | Good, but DOWN is better |\n| RIGHT | (6, 9) | Hits body segment (6, 9) | 3 | FATAL (Moving backwards) |\n\nMoving **DOWN** to (5, 8) is the safest and most efficient path toward $A_B(4, 8)$.\n\n### 4. Immediate Death and Collision Check (S0 moving to (5, 8))\n\n1.  **Off-Board:** (5, 8) is safe.\n2.  **Self-Collision:** Body segments are (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 7). (5, 8) is safe. Our head is at (5, 9). Moving DOWN to (5, 8) is not moving backward into the segment immediately behind the head (6, 9).\n3.  **Enemy Body Collision (S1 body: [(1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2)]):** (5, 8) is safe.\n4.  **Head-on Collision Prediction:** H1 is at (2, 4). The closest H1 can get to H0 is M=6. No head-on collision risk on this turn.\n\nThe move DOWN is safe and sets up the guaranteed capture of $A_B$ next turn.\n\n### 5. Prediction of Enemy 1's Move (2, 4)\n\nH1 is at (2, 4). Its body is [(1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2)].\nNearest competitive target is $A_D(5, 3)$ (M=4).\n\nPossible safe moves for H1:\n1. **UP** to (2, 5). Safe. M to $A_D$: $|2-5| + |5-3| = 5$.\n2. **DOWN** to (2, 3). Safe. M to $A_D$: $|2-5| + |3-3| = 3$. (Closest path)\n3. **LEFT** to (1, 4). Hits body segment (1, 4). FATAL (Moving backwards).\n4. **RIGHT** to (3, 4). Safe. M to $A_D$: $|3-5| + |4-3| = 3$.\n\nH1 is faced with two equally strong moves to reach $A_D(5, 3)$ in 3 moves: DOWN to (2, 3) or RIGHT to (3, 4). Since the previous move was RIGHT (to 2, 4), it's marginally more likely to continue RIGHT to (3, 4) to maintain momentum, but DOWN is equally plausible. We must ensure our move does not put us in conflict regardless of H1's choice. Since H1 is far away (M=6 minimum), their move does not affect our capture of $A_B$.\n\n### 6. Strategic Review\n\nOur plan is solid:\n*   **Turn 19 (Current):** Move DOWN to (5, 8). M to $A_B(4, 8)$ is 1.\n*   **Turn 20 (Next):** Move LEFT to (4, 8), capturing $A_B$. Score becomes 4-5.\n*   **Turn 21:** Decide whether to go for $A_A(3, 8)$ (M=1) or $A_E(8, 7)$ (M=5). $A_A$ is the obvious next choice.\n\nMoving DOWN is the necessary step to execute this plan.\n\n**Future Plan:** Secure $A_B(4, 8)$ on Turn 20, then immediately secure $A_A(3, 8)$ on Turn 21.\n\nDOWN",

My body: [(1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (1,3), (1,2)] (tail at (1,2) \u2013 note the board shows my tail at (1,1) but the listed body ends at (1,2); I\u2019ll trust the text description).  \nCheck moves:\n\n- **UP** to (2,5): Within board. Not my body (my body cells are (1,4),(0,4),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2)). Not enemy #0\u2019s body (enemy body at (6,9),(6,8),(6,7) per text; board shows T at (6,9),(6,8),(6,7)). Safe.\n- **DOWN** to (2,3): Within board. Not my body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (1,4): That\u2019s my own body segment (second segment). **LEFT is NOT safe.**\n- **RIGHT** to (3,4): Within board. Not my body, not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**  \nApples at: (3,8), (4,8), (3,0), (5,3), (8,7).  \nFrom (2,4):\n- **UP** to (2,5): Manhattan distance to nearest apple (3,8) = |2-3| + |5-8| = 1+3 = 4. Distance to (4,8) = 2+3 = 5.\n- **DOWN** to (2,3): Distance to nearest apple (5,3) = |2-5| + |3-3| = 3+0 = 3. Also close to (3,0) = 1+3 = 4.\n- **RIGHT** to (3,4): Distance to (5,3) = 2+1 = 3. Distance to (3,8) = 0+4 = 4.\n\nDOWN and RIGHT are equally close to an apple (distance 3). UP is slightly farther.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**  \n\nIf I move **UP** to (2,5):  \nNew body (no growth): head (2,5), then (2,4),(1,4),(0,4),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2).  \nFrom (2,5) next turn:  \n- UP to (2,6): empty.  \n- DOWN to (2,4): my body (unsafe).  \n- LEFT to (1,5): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (3,5): empty.  \nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (three exits). Good flexibility, moves toward top apples.\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (2,3):  \nNew body: head (2,3), then (2,4),(1,4),(0,4),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2).  \nFrom (2,3) next turn:  \n- UP to (2,4): my body (unsafe).  \n- DOWN to (2,2): empty.  \n- LEFT to (1,3): my body (unsafe).  \n- RIGHT to (3,3): empty.  \nSafe moves: DOWN, RIGHT (only two exits). This reduces future options significantly, and I\u2019m moving toward the bottom edge where apple (3,0) is, but also closer to my own body coil.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (3,4):  \nNew body: head (3,4), then (2,4),(1,4),(0,4),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2).  \nFrom (3,4) next turn:  \n- UP to (3,5): empty.  \n- DOWN to (3,3): empty.  \n- LEFT to (2,4): my body (unsafe).  \n- RIGHT to (4,4): empty.  \nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (three exits). Moves toward center and apple at (5,3).\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential head\u2011on collisions.**  \nEnemy #0 head at (5,9), body [(6,9),(6,8),(6,7)].  \nEnemy\u2019s safe moves from (5,9):  \n- UP: off board (y=10) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN to (5,8): empty (apple at (4,8) and (3,8) nearby).  \n- LEFT to (4,9): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (6,9): its own body (unsafe).  \nEnemy likely moves DOWN toward apples (4,8)/(3,8) or LEFT. Distance from my head (2,4) to enemy head (5,9) is 3+5=8, no collision risk this turn. However, if I move UP, I\u2019m moving toward the same apple cluster enemy may target, increasing future encounter risk. Moving RIGHT keeps me central and toward a different apple (5,3) that enemy is farther from.\n\n**Step 5: Long\u2011term plan.**  \nMy apple lead is 5 vs 3. I should avoid risky confrontations and maintain space. DOWN gives fewer future exits and risks trapping myself near my own body. UP moves toward enemy and top edge. RIGHT moves toward center and apple (5,3) while keeping three exits. That seems best for safety and progress.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,4), I can decide based on enemy movement: if enemy stays top, I can go UP toward (3,5) then (3,6) to approach top apples, or continue RIGHT toward (5,3). Monitor enemy #0\u2019s position\u2014if it moves down toward (5,8), I may want to avoid direct collision course.\n\nRIGHT",

Immediate Death and Collision Check (S0 moving to (4, 8))\n\n1.  **Off-Board:** (4, 8) is safe.\n2.  **Self-Collision:** Our body segments are (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8). (4, 8) is safe.\n3.  **Enemy Body Collision (S1 body: [(2, 4), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3)]):** (4, 8) is safe.\n4.  **Head-on Collision Prediction (Target: (4, 8)):**\n    H1 is at (3, 4). The shortest H1 could travel to reach (4, 8) is M=5. H1 cannot reach (4, 8) this turn. No head-on risk.\n\nThe move LEFT is safe and successful.\n\n### 5. Prediction of Enemy 1's Move (3, 4)\n\nH1 is at (3, 4). Its body is [(2, 4), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 3), (1, 3)]. S1 is currently leading 5 to 3.\n\nS1's most competitive targets are $A_D(5, 3)$ (M=3) and $A_C(3, 0)$ (M=4).\n\nPossible moves for H1:\n1. **UP** to (3, 5). M to $A_D$: $|3-5| + |5-3| = 4$. M to $A_C$: $|3-3| + |5-0| = 5$.\n2. **DOWN** to (3, 3). M to $A_D$: $|3-5| + |3-3| = 2$. M to $A_C$: $|3-3| + |3-0| = 3$. (Optimal path to both)\n3. **LEFT** to (2, 4). Hits body segment (2, 4).

(Optimal path to $A_D$)\n\nThe enemy snake is likely to move **DOWN** to (3, 3) or **RIGHT** to (4, 4) as both reduce the Manhattan distance to nearby apples $A_D$ and $A_C$. Given its previous move was RIGHT (to 3, 4), continuing its X-momentum with **RIGHT** to (4, 4) seems plausible for $A_D(5, 3)$.\n\nIf H1 moves to (4, 4), it would be 1 move away from $A_D(5, 3)$ or 2 moves if it moved DOWN to (3, 3). We expect H1 to move to (3, 3) or (4, 4). This does not interfere with our capture.\n\n### 6. Strategic Review\n\nCapture $A_B(4, 8)$ this turn. Our score will be 4 apples. Our resulting position will be (4, 8).\n\n**Future Plan:** Our next target is $A_A(3, 8)$ (M=1).\n*   **Turn 21 (Next):** From (4, 8), move LEFT to (3, 8) to capture $A_A$. Score becomes 5-5 (Tied with S1).\n*   **Turn 22:** We will be at (3, 8). From there, $A_E(8, 7)$ (M=6) or $A_D(5, 3)$ (M=4) or $A_C(3, 0)$ (M=8). Our body will be longer due to the two captures. We will reassess the board and S1's position at that time, likely aiming to cut off S1's path or maximize distance to $A_E$.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nTurn: 20 / 150\n\n### 1. Game State Analysis\n\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):** Head (5, 8). Target: $A_B(4, 8)$.\n*   **Enemy Snake 1 (ID 1):** Head (3, 4). Likely targeting $A_D(5, 3)$ via (4, 4) or $A_C(3, 0)$ via (3, 3).\n*   **Apples Scored:** We need to catch up (3 vs 5).\n\n### 2. Move Evaluation\n\nThe move **LEFT** to (4, 8) is safe (no self, enemy, or wall collision) and secures the apple $A_B$. This is the optimal, priority move.\n\n### 3. Long-Term Plan\n\n*   **Turn 20 (Current):** Move LEFT to (4, 8). Capture $A_B$. (Score 4)\n*   **Turn 21 (Next):** From (4, 8), move LEFT to (3, 8). Capture $A_A$. (Score 5)\n*   **Turn 22:** Re-evaluate and probably head for $A_D(5, 3)$ (M=4) to intercept S1 or $A_E(8, 7)$ (M=6) for uncontested growth.\n\nLEFT",

Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**  \nApples at: (3,8), (4,8), (3,0), (5,3), (8,7).  \nFrom (3,4):\n- **UP** to (3,5): Manhattan distance to nearest apple (3,8) = |3-3| + |5-8| = 0+3 = 3. Distance to (4,8) = 1+3 = 4.\n- **DOWN** to (3,3): Distance to nearest apple (5,3) = |3-5| + |3-3| = 2+0 = 2. Also close to (3,0) = 0+3 = 3.\n- **RIGHT** to (4,4): Distance to (5,3) = 1+1 = 2. Distance to (4,8) = 0+4 = 4.\n\nDOWN and RIGHT are equally close to an apple (distance 2). UP is slightly farther.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**  \n\nIf I move **UP** to (3,5):  \nNew body (no growth): head (3,5), then (3,4),(2,4),(1,4),(0,4),(0,3),(1,3).  \nFrom (3,5) next turn:  \n- UP to (3,6): empty.  \n- DOWN to (3,4): my body (unsafe).  \n- LEFT to (2,5): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (4,5): empty.  \nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (three exits). Good flexibility, moves toward top apples.\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (3,3):  \nNew body: head (3,3), then (3,4),(2,4),(1,4),(0,4),(0,3),(1,3).  \nFrom (3,3) next turn:  \n- UP to (3,4): my body (unsafe).  \n- DOWN to (3,2): empty.  \n- LEFT to (2,3): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (4,3): empty.  \nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (three exits). Moves toward apple (5,3) and (3,0).\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (4,4):  \nNew body: head (4,4), then (3,4),(2,4),(1,4),(0,4),(0,3),(1,3).  \nFrom (4,4) next turn:  \n- UP to (4,5): empty.  \n- DOWN to (4,3): empty.  \n- LEFT to (3,4): my body (unsafe).  \n- RIGHT to (5,4): empty.  \nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (three exits). Moves toward apple (5,3) and center.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential head\u2011on collisions.**  \nEnemy #0 head at (5,8), body [(5,9), (6,9), (6,8)].  \nEnemy\u2019s safe moves from (5,8):  \n- UP to (5,9): its own body (unsafe).  \n- DOWN to (5,7): empty.  \n- LEFT to (4,8): empty (apple at (4,8)).  \n- RIGHT to (6,8): its own body (unsafe).  \nEnemy likely moves LEFT to eat apple (4,8) or DOWN. Distance from my head (3,4) to enemy head (5,8) is 2+4=6, no collision risk this turn. However, if I move UP, I\u2019m moving toward the same top apple cluster enemy may target, increasing future encounter risk. Moving RIGHT or DOWN keeps me toward different apples (5,3) or (3,0) that enemy is farther from.\n\n**Step 5: Long\u2011term plan.**  \nMy apple lead is 5 vs 3. I should avoid risky confrontations and maintain space. All three safe moves give three exits next turn. DOWN moves toward apple (5,3) and (3,0) while staying clear of enemy. RIGHT also moves toward (5,3) but slightly closer to center. UP moves toward enemy\u2019s area and top apples, which could lead to a future collision or competition. Since I have a lead, I prefer to play safer and collect apples away from the enemy.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (3,3) after DOWN, I can assess: if enemy moves LEFT to (4,8), I can continue toward (5,3) or (3,0). Keep monitoring enemy #0\u2019s position\u2014if it moves down toward (5,7), I may want to avoid moving up into its path. For now, DOWN seems best to collect nearby apples while staying flexible.\n\nDOWN",

I am currently 1 apple behind, having caught up one apple last turn.\n\n**Goal:** Capture the next immediate apple, $A_A (3, 8)$, to tie the score.\n\n### 2. Identifying Targets and Distances\n\nH0 is at (4, 8). H1 is at (3, 3).\n\n| Apple | Position | H0 Distance (M) | H1 Distance (M) | Competition Score (H0-H1) |\n| :---: | :------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :---: |\n| $A_A$ | (3, 8) | $|4-3| + |8-8| = 1$ | $|3-3| + |3-8| = 5$ | -4 (H0 dominant) |\n| $A_D$ | (5, 3) | $|4-5| + |8-3| = 6$ | $|3-5| + |3-3| = 2$ | +4 (H1 dominant) |\n| $A_E$ | (8, 7) | $|4-8| + |8-7| = 5$ | $|3-8| + |3-7| = 9$ | -4 (H0 dominant) |\n| $A_F$ | (9, 7) | $|4-9| + |8-7| = 6$ | $|3-9| + |3-7| = 10$ | -4 (H0 dominant) |\n| $A_C$ | (3, 0) | $|4-3| + |8-0| = 9$ | $|3-3| + |3-0| = 3$ | +6 (H1 dominant) |\n\n$A_A (3, 8)$ is 1 move away and entirely uncontested.\n\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (4, 8)\n\nMy current body is [(5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8)].\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check | M to $A_A(3, 8)$ | Status |\n| :--: | :----------: | :-------------: | :--------------: | :---: |\n| UP | (4, 9) | Safe (Empty) | 2 | Moves away from target |\n| DOWN | (4, 7) | Safe (Empty) | 2 | Moves away from target |\n| LEFT | (3, 8) | Apple $A_A$ | 0 | Optimal Capture |\n| RIGHT | (5, 8) | Hits body segment (5, 8) | 2 | FATAL (Moving backwards) |\n\nMoving **LEFT** to (3, 8) safely captures the apple $A_A$.\n\n### 4. Immediate Death and Collision Check (S0 moving to (3, 8))\n\n1.  **Off-Board:** (3, 8) is safe.\n2.  **Self-Collision:** Our body segments are (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8). (3, 8) is safe. The segment (5, 8) will become the tail segment, but since we eat, it remains at (5, 8), and the rest shift.\n3.  **Enemy Body Collision (S1 body: [(3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 3)]):** (3, 8) is safe.\n4.  **Head-on Collision Prediction (Target: (3, 8)):**\n    H1 is at (3, 3). The shortest H1 could travel to reach (3, 8) is M=5. H1 cannot reach (3, 8) this turn. No head-on risk.\n\nThe move LEFT is safe and successful.\n\n### 5. Prediction of Enemy 1's Move (3, 3)\n\nH1 is at (3, 3). Its body is [(3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 3)]. S1 is leading 5 to 4.\n\nS1's two best targets are $A_D(5, 3)$ (M=2) and $A_C(3, 0)$ (M=3).\n\nPossible moves for H1:\n1. **UP** to (3, 4). Hits body segment (3, 4). FATAL (Moving backwards).\n2. **DOWN** to (3, 2). M to $A_D$: $|3-5| + |2-3| = 3$. M to $A_C$: $|3-3| + |2-0| = 2$. (Optimal path to $A_C$)\n3. **LEFT** to (2, 3). M to $A_D$: $|2-5| + |3-3| = 3$. M to $A_C$: $|2-3| + |3-0| = 4$.\n4. **RIGHT** to (4, 3). M to $A_D$: $|4-5| + |3-3| = 1$. (Optimal path to $A_D$)\n\nH1 will likely move **RIGHT** to (4, 3) to capture $A_D$ next turn, or **DOWN** to (3, 2) to capture $A_C$ next turn. Given the board layout, RIGHT to (4, 3) for the central apple $A_D(5, 3)$ seems slightly more likely. We expect H1 to move to (4, 3) or (3, 2). This does not affect our move.\n\n### 6. Strategic Review\n\nCapture $A_A(3, 8)$ this turn. Our score will be 5 apples, tying S1. Our resulting position will be (3, 8).\n\n**Future Plan:**\nWe will be at (3, 8) (Score 5). H1 will likely be at (4, 3) or (3, 2) (Score 5).\nOur body length increases significantly. The apples $A_D$ and $A_C$ are now highly contested by H1.\nThe next available, relatively isolated apples are $A_E(8, 7)$ (M=5 from (3, 8)) and $A_F(9, 7)$ (M=6 from (3, 8)).\n\n*   **Turn 22 (Next):** From (3, 8), move RIGHT to (4, 8) or DOWN to (3, 7) starting the path toward $A_E(8, 7)$. Since our body is forming an extended wall in (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), moving DOWN to (3, 7) or RIGHT to (4, 8) are viable. Moving DOWN prepares us to circumvent our body or move through the middle, perhaps aiming for $A_D$ if H1 failed, or heading long for $(8, 7)$. Let's prioritize getting clear of the North wall and towards the center. DOWN to (3, 7) is a good opening move.\n\nLEFT\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nTurn: 21 / 150\n\n### 1. Game State Analysis\n\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):** Head (4, 8). Current Score 4. Target: $A_A(3, 8)$ (M=1).\n*   **Enemy Snake 1 (ID 1):** Head (3, 3). Current Score 5. Likely targeting $A_D(5, 3)$ or $A_C(3, 0)$.\n\n### 2. Move Evaluation\n\nThe move **LEFT** to (3, 8) is safe and secures the apple $A_A$. This ties the score at 5-5.\n\n### 3. Long-Term Plan\n\n*   **Turn 21 (Current):** Move LEFT to (3, 8). Capture $A_A$. (Score 5)\n*   **Turn 22 (Next):** We will be at (3, 8). H1 is consolidating low. We should pivot towards the uncontested apples in the East: $A_E(8, 7)$ (M=5) or $A_F(9, 7)$ (M=6). A good opening move from (3, 8) is **DOWN** to (3, 7) to start migrating South-East, keeping space open around our body segments now cluttering the North-West area.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nLEFT",

Tied.\n\n**Goal:** Secure the next closest uncontested apple, prioritizing those that lead to better board control.\n\n### 2. Identifying Targets and Distances\n\nH0 is at (3, 8). H1 is at (4, 3).\n\n| Apple | Position | H0 Distance (M) | H1 Distance (M) | Competition Score (H0-H1) |\n| :---: | :------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :---: |\n| $A_B$ | (5, 3) | $|3-5|+|8-3| = 7$ | $|4-5|+|3-3| = 1$ | +6 (H1 dominant) |\n| $A_C$ | (8, 7) | $|3-8|+|8-7| = 6$ | $|4-8|+|3-7| = 8$ | -2 (H0 dominant) |\n| $A_D$ | (9, 7) | $|3-9|+|8-7| = 7$ | $|4-9|+|3-7| = 9$ | -2 (H0 dominant) |\n| $A_A$ | (3, 0) | $|3-3|+|8-0| = 8$ | $|4-3|+|3-0| = 4$ | +4 (H1 dominant) |\n| $A_E$ | (7, 0) | $|3-7|+|8-0| = 12$ | $|4-7|+|3-0| = 6$ | +6 (H1 dominant) |\n\n$A_B (5, 3)$ is 1 move away for H1, making it highly contested, likely captured by S1 this turn. H1 is at (4, 3) and *must* move RIGHT to (5, 3) to capture it.\n\nThe most viable apples for H0 are $A_C(8, 7)$ (M=6) and $A_D(9, 7)$ (M=7).\n\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (3, 8)\n\nH0 is at (3, 8). Body: [(4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8)].\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check (Self/Wall/Enemy Body) | Prediction for H1 (4, 3) | Head-on Risk | Status |\n| :--: | :----------: | :------------------------------------: | :-----------------------: | :----------: | :---: |\n| UP | (3, 9) | Safe (Empty) | RIGHT to (5, 3) | None | Good |\n| DOWN | (3, 7) | Safe (Empty) | RIGHT to (5, 3) | None | Good (Towards $A_C$) |\n| LEFT | (2, 8) | Safe (Empty) | RIGHT to (5, 3) | None | Safe |\n| RIGHT | (4, 8) | Hits body segment (4, 8) | N/A | FATAL (Moving backwards) | FATAL |\n\nThree safe moves: UP (3, 9), DOWN (3, 7), LEFT (2, 8).\n\n### 4. Evaluating Safe Moves\n\nMy current position is near the top wall and crowded by my own body segments in the North/North-East corner. My long-term goal is to move towards $A_C(8, 7)$ or $A_D(9, 7)$.\n\n1.  **DOWN to (3, 7):**\n    *   Moves away from the wall and begins path finding toward the East (via the central channel).\n    *   Distance to $A_C(8, 7)$ from (3, 7) is $|3-8| + |7-7| = 5$. This is optimal.\n    *   Keeps open area available.\n2.  **UP to (3, 9):**\n    *   Moves along the top wall. While safe, it restricts movement options (only RIGHT or LEFT are immediately accessible without hitting the wall next turn).\n    *   Distance to $A_C(8, 7)$ from (3, 9) is $|3-8| + |9-7| = 7$. Worse.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 8):**\n    *   Moves into the relatively empty western side, away from the enemy and main targets.\n    *   Distance to $A_C(8, 7)$ from (2, 8) is $|2-8| + |8-7| = 7$. Worse.\n\n**Optimal Choice:** DOWN to (3, 7). This directs the snake toward the distant, but available, apples $A_C$ and $A_D$, and loosens the snake from the North wall, where several body segments are currently located.\n\n### 5. Collision Check (Overall)\n\n**H0 move: DOWN to (3, 7)**\n*   (3, 7) is empty. Safe from wall/self collision.\n*   Predicted H1 move: RIGHT to (5, 3).\n*   Predicted H1 body location: [(4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4)]. (3, 7) is not near S1's body or predicted head, so no collision risk.\n\nThe move DOWN is safe and strategically sound.\n\n### 6. Strategy Note for Future Turns (for Turn 23)\n\nI expect S1 to capture $A_B(5, 3)$, making the score 5-6 in S1's favor. I will be at (3, 7). H1 will be at (5, 3).\n\n**Turn 23 Plan:** From (3, 7), prioritize moving EAST towards $A_C(8, 7)$. Options include RIGHT to (4, 7) or DOWN/RIGHT combination depending on future body position. Since my body segments (4, 8) and (5, 8) are still near, moving RIGHT to (4, 7) keeps good distance from the currently complex body structure.\n\nDOWN",

Not enemy #0\u2019s body (enemy body: [(4,8), (5,8), (5,9), (6,9), (6,8)]). Safe.  \n- **DOWN** to (4,2): Within board. Not my body, not enemy body. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** to (3,3): That\u2019s my own body (second segment). **LEFT is NOT safe.**  \n- **RIGHT** to (5,3): Within board. Not my body, not enemy body. There is an apple at (5,3). Safe.  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**  \nApples at: (3,0), (5,3), (8,7), (9,7), (7,0).  \nFrom (4,3):  \n\n- **UP** to (4,4): Manhattan distance to nearest apple (5,3) = |4\u20115| + |4\u20113| = 1+1 = 2. Distance to (8,7) = 4+3 = 7.  \n- **DOWN** to (4,2): Distance to (3,0) = 1+2 = 3. Distance to (5,3) = 1+1 = 2.  \n- **RIGHT** to (5,3): That\u2019s an apple cell. Distance 0 to that apple.  \n\nRIGHT is directly onto an apple (5,3). Eating it would grow me by 1 segment and increase my apple lead (currently 5 vs 5). UP and DOWN are farther from apples.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**  \n\nIf I move **RIGHT** (eat apple at (5,3)):  \nNew body (growth): head (5,3), then (4,3),(3,3),(3,4),(2,4),(1,4),(0,4),(0,3). Length becomes 8.  \nFrom (5,3) next turn:  \n- UP to (5,4): empty.  \n- DOWN to (5,2): empty.  \n- LEFT to (4,3): my body (unsafe).  \n- RIGHT to (6,3): empty.  \nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (three exits). Good flexibility.\n\nIf I move **UP** to (4,4):  \nNew body (no growth): head (4,4), then (4,3),(3,3),(3,4),(2,4),(1,4),(0,4),(0,3).  \nFrom (4,4) next turn:  \n- UP to (4,5): empty.  \n- DOWN to (4,3): my body (unsafe).  \n- LEFT to (3,4): my body (unsafe).  \n- RIGHT to (5,4): empty.  \nSafe moves: UP, RIGHT (only two exits). This reduces flexibility.\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (4,2):  \nNew body (no growth): head (4,2), then (4,3),(3,3),(3,4),(2,4),(1,4),(0,4),(0,3).  \nFrom (4,2) next turn:  \n- UP to (4,3): my body (unsafe).  \n- DOWN to (4,1): empty.  \n- LEFT to (3,2): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (5,2): empty.  \nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (three exits). Good flexibility but no immediate apple.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential head\u2011on collisions.**  \nEnemy #0 head at (3,8), body [(4,8), (5,8), (5,9), (6,9), (6,8)].  \nEnemy\u2019s safe moves from (3,8):  \n- UP to (3,9): empty.  \n- DOWN to (3,7): empty.  \n- LEFT to (2,8): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (4,8): its own body (unsafe).  \nEnemy could move UP, DOWN, or LEFT. Distance from my head (4,3) to enemy head (3,8) is 1+5=6, no collision risk this turn. Moving RIGHT to (5,3) keeps me far from enemy\u2019s area.\n\n**Step 5: Long\u2011term plan.**  \nMy apple lead is currently tied 5\u20135. Eating the apple at (5,3) gives me a 6\u20135 lead and grows my snake, which can be advantageous but also makes maneuvering slightly harder. However, the board is still open, and RIGHT offers three safe exits next turn. Avoiding growth by moving UP reduces future flexibility (only two exits). DOWN is safe but delays eating. Given the objective to increase score and maintain options, eating the apple now is optimal.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating (5,3), my head will be at (5,3) with length 8. From there, I will have UP, DOWN, RIGHT as safe moves. I should avoid moving LEFT into my own body. I can consider moving toward the apple cluster at (7,0) or (8,7)/(9,7) in the upper-right, but must monitor enemy #0\u2019s movement\u2014it is currently in the top-left area. Keep building my lead while staying in open areas with multiple exits.\n\n**Final choice:** RIGHT (eat the apple at (5,3)).\n\nRIGHT",

S1 is leading by one apple.\n\n**Goal:** Close the score gap quickly by moving toward the most favorable cluster of apples, which currently looks like $A_B(8, 7)$ and $A_C(9, 7)$.\n\n### 2. Identifying Targets and Distances\n\nH0 is at (3, 7). H1 is at (5, 3).\n\n| Apple | Position | H0 Distance (M) | H1 Distance (M) | Competition Score (H0-H1) |\n| :---: | :------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :---: |\n| $A_B$ | (8, 7) | $|3-8|+|7-7| = 5$ | $|5-8|+|3-7| = 7$ | -2 (H0 dominant) |\n| $A_C$ | (9, 7) | $|3-9|+|7-7| = 6$ | $|5-9|+|3-7| = 8$ | -2 (H0 dominant) |\n| $A_A$ | (3, 0) | $|3-3|+|7-0| = 7$ | $|5-3|+|3-0| = 5$ | +2 (H1 dominant) |\n| $A_D$ | (7, 0) | $|3-7|+|7-0| = 11$ | $|5-7|+|3-0| = 5$ | +6 (H1 dominant) |\n| $A_E$ | (5, 1) | $|3-5|+|7-1| = 8$ | $|5-5|+|3-1| = 2$ | +6 (H1 dominant) |\n\nApples $A_B(8, 7)$ and $A_C(9, 7)$ are clearly the best targets. $A_B$ is 5 moves away.\n\nThe bottom apples ($A_A, A_D, A_E$) are dominated by S1, especially $A_E(5, 1)$, which is only 2 moves away. S1 is likely to move DOWN to grab $A_E$.\n\n**Strategy:** Move EAST towards $A_B(8, 7)$.\n\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (3, 7)\n\nH0 is at (3, 7). Body: [(3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9)].\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check (Self/Wall) | Prediction for H1 (5, 3) | Head-on Risk | Status |\n| :--: | :----------: | :-------------------------: | :-----------------------: | :----------: | :---: |\n| UP | (3, 8) | Hits tail segment (3, 8) | Likely DOWN to (5, 2) | None | FATAL |\n| DOWN | (3, 6) | Safe (Empty) | Likely DOWN to (5, 2) | None | Safe |\n| LEFT | (2, 7) | Safe (Empty) | Likely DOWN to (5, 2) | None | Safe |\n| RIGHT | (4, 7) | Safe (Empty) | Likely DOWN to (5, 2) | None | Safe (Optimal) |\n\n*   **UP to (3, 8)** is blocked because (3, 8) is my current body segment, which was the previous head position. **FATAL.**\n*   The three safe moves are DOWN (3, 6), LEFT (2, 7), and RIGHT (4, 7).\n\n### 4. Evaluating Safe Moves\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (4, 7):**\n    *   Moves directly toward $A_B(8, 7)$. New Manhattan distance: $|4-8|+|7-7| = 4$. This is the fastest route.\n    *   Keeps good distance from S1 body/head.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 6):**\n    *   Moves away from the target $A_B(8, 7)$. New Distance: $|3-8|+|6-7|=6$. Worse.\n    *   Moves closer to the powerful enemy, S1 (at 5, 3). Distance to H1: $|3-5|+|6-3|=5$.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 7):**\n    *   Moves away from the target $A_B(8, 7)$. New Distance: $|2-8|+|7-7|=6$. Worse.\n\n**Optimal Choice:** RIGHT to (4, 7). This move commits to the best available scoring opportunity ($A_B$ and $A_C$).\n\n### 5. Collision Check (Overall)\n\n**H0 move: RIGHT to (4, 7)**\n*   (4, 7) is empty. Safe from wall/self collision.\n*   **Predicted H1 move: DOWN to (5, 2)** (H1 is 2 moves away from $A_E(5, 1)$).\n*   (4, 7) is nowhere near S1's predicted head (5, 2) or its body. Safe.\n\nThis move is strategically sound and safe.\n\n### 6. Strategy Note for Future Turns (for Turn 24)\n\nI expect S1 to capture $A_E(5, 1)$ next turn, making the score 5-7 in S1's favor. I will be at (4, 7). H1 will be at (5, 2). I must now focus on securing $A_B(8, 7)$. From (4, 7), the next step will likely be RIGHT to (5, 7).\n\nRIGHT",

My body: [(4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4), (0,4)].  \nCheck moves:  \n\n- **UP** to (5,4): Within board (0\u20139). Not my body. Not enemy #0\u2019s body (enemy body: [(3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (5,9), (6,9)]). Safe.  \n- **DOWN** to (5,2): Within board. Not my body, not enemy body. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** to (4,3): That\u2019s my own body (second segment). **LEFT is NOT safe.**  \n- **RIGHT** to (6,3): Within board. Not my body, not enemy body. Safe.  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**  \nApples at: (3,0), (8,7), (9,7), (7,0), (5,1).  \nFrom (5,3):  \n\n- **UP** to (5,4): Manhattan distance to nearest apple (5,1) = |5\u20115| + |4\u20111| = 0+3 = 3. Distance to (7,0) = 2+4 = 6.  \n- **DOWN** to (5,2): Distance to (5,1) = 0+1 = 1. Distance to (3,0) = 2+2 = 4.  \n- **RIGHT** to (6,3): Distance to (7,0) = 1+3 = 4. Distance to (8,7) = 2+4 = 6.  \n\nDOWN is closest to an apple (5,1 is directly below). Eating it next turn would grow me and increase my lead (currently 6 vs 5). UP and RIGHT are farther.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**  \n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (5,2):  \nNew body (no growth): head (5,2), then (5,3),(4,3),(3,3),(3,4),(2,4),(1,4),(0,4).  \nFrom (5,2) next turn:  \n- UP to (5,3): my body (unsafe).  \n- DOWN to (5,1): apple cell (safe).  \n- LEFT to (4,2): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (6,2): empty.  \nSafe moves: DOWN (onto apple), LEFT, RIGHT (three exits). Good flexibility and sets up immediate apple next turn.\n\nIf I move **UP** to (5,4):  \nNew body (no growth): head (5,4), then (5,3),(4,3),(3,3),(3,4),(2,4),(1,4),(0,4).  \nFrom (5,4) next turn:  \n- UP to (5,5): empty.  \n- DOWN to (5,3): my body (unsafe).  \n- LEFT to (4,4): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (6,4): empty.  \nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (three exits). No nearby apples.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (6,3):  \nNew body (no growth): head (6,3), then (5,3),(4,3),(3,3),(3,4),(2,4),(1,4),(0,4).  \nFrom (6,3) next turn:  \n- UP to (6,4): empty.  \n- DOWN to (6,2): empty.  \n- LEFT to (5,3): my body (unsafe).  \n- RIGHT to (7,3): empty.  \nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (three exits). Moves toward apple at (7,0) but slower.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential head\u2011on collisions.**  \nEnemy #0 head at (3,7), body [(3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (5,9), (6,9)].  \nEnemy\u2019s safe moves from (3,7):  \n- UP to (3,8): its own body (unsafe).  \n- DOWN to (3,6): empty.  \n- LEFT to (2,7): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (4,7): empty.  \nEnemy could move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Distance from my head (5,3) to enemy head (3,7) is 2+4=6, no collision risk this turn. Moving DOWN keeps me far from enemy\u2019s area.\n\n**Step 5: Long\u2011term plan.**  \nMy apple lead is 6\u20135. Eating the apple at (5,1) next turn would extend my lead to 7\u20135 and grow my snake. Moving DOWN now positions me directly above that apple, giving me the option to eat it next turn while maintaining three safe exits. Moving UP or RIGHT delays eating and doesn\u2019t improve my immediate score advantage. Given the objective to increase score while keeping options open, DOWN is optimal.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving to (5,2), my head will be at (5,2) with length 7. From there, I can eat the apple at (5,1) by moving DOWN, or move LEFT/RIGHT to explore. I should monitor enemy #0\u2019s movement\u2014it is currently in the top-left area. Keep building my lead while staying in open areas with multiple exits.\n\n**Final choice:** DOWN",

(0, 0) to (9, 9).\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head (H0): (4, 7).\n    *   Body: [(3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9)]. Length 6. Kills: 0. Apples: 5.\n    *   Last move: RIGHT from (3, 7) to (4, 7), as intended.\n*   **Enemy Snake 1 (ID 1):**\n    *   Head (H1): (5, 2).\n    *   Body: [(5, 3), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4)]. Length 7. Kills: 0. Apples: 6.\n    *   Since my last analysis predicted S1 would move DOWN towards $A_E(5, 1)$, and H1 is now at (5, 2), it is highly likely S1 moved DOWN from (5, 3) to (5, 2) without eating an apple yet.\n*   **Apples remaining at:**\n    *   $A_A$: (3, 0)\n    *   $A_B$: (8, 7)\n    *   $A_C$: (9, 7)\n    *   $A_D$: (7, 0)\n    *   $A_E$: (5, 1)\n\n**Score:** S0 (5) vs S1 (6). S1 is leading by one apple.\n\n**Goal:** Secure $A_B(8, 7)$ and $A_C(9, 7)$ before S1 can finish off the lower apples and potentially challenge the upper ones.\n\n### 2. Identifying Targets and Distances\n\nH0 is at (4, 7). H1 is at (5, 2).\n\n| Apple | Position | H0 Distance (M) | H1 Distance (M) | Competition Score (H0-H1) |\n| :---: | :------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :---: |\n| $A_B$ | (8, 7) | $|4-8|+|7-7| = 4$ | $|5-8|+|2-7| = 8$ | -4 (H0 huge lead) |\n| $A_C$ | (9, 7) | $|4-9|+|7-7| = 5$ | $|5-9|+|2-7| = 9$ | -4 (H0 huge lead) |\n| $A_E$ | (5, 1) | $|4-5|+|7-1| = 7$ | $|5-5|+|2-1| = 1$ | +6 (H1 dominant) |\n| $A_A$ | (3, 0) | $|4-3|+|7-0| = 8$ | $|5-3|+|2-0| = 4$ | +4 (H1 dominant) |\n| $A_D$ | (7, 0) | $|4-7|+|7-0| = 10$ | $|5-7|+|2-0| = 4$ | +6 (H1 dominant) |\n\nThe prediction holds: S1 is one move away from $A_E(5, 1)$. I must focus entirely on the upper cluster, starting with $A_B(8, 7)$.\n\n**Strategy:** Continue moving EAST towards $A_B(8, 7)$.\n\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (4, 7)\n\nH0 is at (4, 7). Body: [(3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 9)]. The tail (T) will move from (5, 9) to (5, 8), clearing (5, 9).\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check (Self/Wall) | Status |\n| :--: | :----------: | :-------------------------: | :---: |\n| UP | (4, 8) | Hits immediate body segment (4, 8) | FATAL |\n| DOWN | (4, 6) | Safe (Empty) | Safe |\n| LEFT | (3, 7) | Hits immediate body segment (3, 7). Backwards move. | FATAL |\n| RIGHT | (5, 7) | Safe (Empty) | Safe (Optimal) |\n\n*   **UP to (4, 8)** is blocked. (4, 8) is a body segment. **FATAL.**\n*   **LEFT to (3, 7)** is blocked. (3, 7) is the segment just behind the head. **FATAL.**\n*   Safe moves: DOWN (4, 6) and RIGHT (5, 7).\n\n### 4. Evaluating Safe Moves\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (5, 7):**\n    *   Moves directly toward $A_B(8, 7)$. New Manhattan distance: $|5-8|+|7-7| = 3$. This is the fastest route.\n    *   Keeps good distance from S1.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 6):**\n    *   Moves away from the target $A_B(8, 7)$. New Distance: $|4-8|+|6-7|=5$. Worse.\n    *   Moves closer to H1 (5, 2).\n\n**Optimal Choice:** RIGHT to (5, 7).\n\n### 5. Collision Check (Overall)\n\n**H0 chosen move: RIGHT to (5, 7).**\n*   (5, 7) is empty. Safe from wall/self collision.\n*   **Predicted H1 move:** H1 is at (5, 2) and $A_E$ is at (5, 1). H1 is almost certainly moving **DOWN to (5, 1)** to eat the apple.\n*   H0 at (5, 7) and H1 at (5, 1) are widely separated. No head-on collision risk.\n\nThis move is safe and directly advances H0 toward the current priority apple cluster.\n\n### 6. Strategy Note for Future Turns (for Turn 25)\n\nI expect S1 to capture $A_E(5, 1)$, making the score 5-7. I will be at (5, 7). H1 will be at (5, 1) and will have grown.\nFrom (5, 7), the next steps towards $A_B(8, 7)$ will be RIGHT to (6, 7), then RIGHT to (7, 7), then RIGHT to (8, 7) (capturing the apple). I am on a clear 3-move path to the first apple.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples are at (3,0), (8,7), (9,7), (7,0), (5,1).\n\n**Step 1: Check each direction for immediate death.**\n- **UP** to (5,3): That's my own body (first segment). **NOT safe.**\n- **DOWN** to (5,1): Within board (0-9). Contains an apple. Not my body. Not enemy #0's body (enemy body: [(3,7), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (5,9)]). Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (4,2): Within board. Not my body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (6,2): Within board. Not my body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**\nFrom (5,2):\n- **DOWN** to (5,1): Lands directly on an apple. This would grow my snake immediately, increasing my lead to 7 apples vs enemy's 5.\n- **LEFT** to (4,2): Manhattan distance to nearest apple (3,0) = |4-3| + |2-0| = 1+2 = 3. Distance to (5,1) = 1+1 = 2.\n- **RIGHT** to (6,2): Distance to (7,0) = |6-7| + |2-0| = 1+2 = 3.\n\nMoving DOWN eats an apple this turn, which is the most direct way to increase my score advantage.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**\nIf I move **DOWN** and eat the apple at (5,1):\n- My new length will be 8. My new body: head (5,1), then (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4), (1,4). The tail stays at (1,4) because I grew.\n- From (5,1) next turn:\n    - UP to (5,2): my new body (second segment) - unsafe.\n    - DOWN to (5,0): empty.\n    - LEFT to (4,1): empty.\n    - RIGHT to (6,1): empty.\n- Safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (three exits). Good flexibility.\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (4,2) (no growth):\n- From (4,2) next turn, I could move DOWN to (4,1) or LEFT to (3,2) to approach the apple at (3,0), but it delays scoring.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (6,2) (no growth):\n- From (6,2), I'm farther from the cluster of apples at (3,0) and (7,0).\n\nEating the apple now is optimal for score and maintains good future mobility.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions.**\nEnemy #0 head is at (4,7). Its safe moves from there are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (checking: UP to (4,8) is its body? Wait, enemy body is [(3,7), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8), (5,9)]. So UP to (4,8) is its own body - unsafe. DOWN to (4,6) is empty. LEFT to (3,7) is its own body - unsafe. RIGHT to (5,7) is empty. So its safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT).\nThe distance from my future head (5,1) to enemy's possible heads next turn ((4,6) or (5,7)) is at least 5+ Manhattan distance, so no risk of head-on collision this turn or next.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan.**\nMy lead is 6-5. Eating the apple at (5,1) now extends it to 7-5. After eating, I should aim for the apple at (3,0) or (7,0) while keeping distance from the enemy in the top area. My immediate next turn from (5,1) will have three safe exits. I should avoid moving back into my long body in the center-left. The enemy is currently constrained near the top wall with limited mobility; I can capitalize on my lead by collecting the lower apples.\n\n**Final choice:** DOWN",

Score is now 5 vs 7.\n*   **Apples remaining at:**\n    *   $A_A$: (3, 0)\n    *   $A_B$: (8, 7)\n    *   $A_C$: (9, 7)\n    *   $A_D$: (7, 0)\n    *   $A_E$: (8, 1) - **New apple (8, 1) replaced (5, 1).**\n\n**Score:** S0 (5) vs S1 (7). S1 is leading by 2 apples and is larger (length 8 vs 6). I must prioritize growth and score capture.\n\n**Goal:** Capture $A_B(8, 7)$ and $A_C(9, 7)$.\n\n### 2. Identifying Targets and Distances\n\nH0 is at (5, 7). H1 is at (5, 1).\n\n| Apple | Position | H0 Distance (M) | H1 Distance (M) | Competition Score (H0-H1) |\n| :---: | :------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :---: |\n| $A_B$ | (8, 7) | $|5-8|+|7-7| = 3$ | $|5-8|+|1-7| = 9$ | -6 (H0 dominant) |\n| $A_C$ | (9, 7) | $|5-9|+|7-7| = 4$ | $|5-9|+|1-7| = 10$ | -6 (H0 dominant) |\n| $A_A$ | (3, 0) | $|5-3|+|7-0| = 9$ | $|5-3|+|1-0| = 3$ | +6 (H1 dominant) |\n| $A_D$ | (7, 0) | $|5-7|+|7-0| = 9$ | $|5-7|+|1-0| = 3$ | +6 (H1 dominant) |\n| $A_E$ | (8, 1) | $|5-8|+|7-1| = 9$ | $|5-8|+|1-1| = 3$ | +6 (H1 dominant) |\n\nThe upper cluster $A_B(8, 7)$ and $A_C(9, 7)$ remains the undisputed primary target for S0. H0 is exactly 3 moves away from $A_B$. H1 is in the south, likely pursuing one of the three apples clustered there.\n\n**Strategy:** Continue moving EAST toward $A_B(8, 7)$.\n\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (5, 7)\n\nH0 is at (5, 7). Body: [(4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8)]. The tail (T) will move from (5, 8) to (4, 8), clearing (5, 8).\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check (Self/Wall) | Status |\n| :--: | :----------: | :-------------------------: | :---: |\n| UP | (5, 8) | Hits immediate body segment (5, 8) | FATAL |\n| DOWN | (5, 6) | Safe (Empty) | Safe |\n| LEFT | (4, 7) | Hits immediate body segment (4, 7). Backwards move. | FATAL |\n| RIGHT | (6, 7) | Safe (Empty) | Safe (Optimal) |\n\n*   **UP to (5, 8)** is blocked by my own body. **FATAL.**\n*   **LEFT to (4, 7)** is blocked by my own body segment. **FATAL.**\n*   Safe moves: DOWN (5, 6) and RIGHT (6, 7).\n\n### 4. Evaluating Safe Moves\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (6, 7):**\n    *   Moves directly toward $A_B(8, 7)$. New Manhattan distance: $|6-8|+|7-7| = 2$. This maintains the fastest path.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 6):**\n    *   Moves slightly further away from $A_B(8, 7)$. New Distance: $|5-8|+|6-7|=4$. Worse.\n    *   No strategic benefit relative to S1.\n\n**Optimal Choice:** RIGHT to (6, 7).\n\n### 5. Collision Check (Overall)\n\n**H0 chosen move: RIGHT to (6, 7).**\n*   (6, 7) is empty. Safe from wall/self collision.\n*   **Predicted H1 move:** H1 is at (5, 1). It has three equally close apples: $A_A(3, 0)$, $A_D(7, 0)$, and $A_E(8, 1)$. H1 will likely move towards one of them. For instance, if H1 moves RIGHT to (6, 1) or DOWN to (5, 0), it is very far from H0 at (6, 7).\n*   No collision risk with S1.\n\nThis move is safe and keeps S0 on a quick path to capture the next apple. I am 2 moves away from eating $A_B$.\n\n### 6. Strategy Note for Future Turns (Turn 26 onwards)\n\n1. **Turn 26:** Move RIGHT to (7, 7). I will be 1 move away from $A_B(8, 7)$.\n2. **Turn 27:** Move RIGHT to (8, 7). Capture $A_B$. Score 6-7.\n3. **Turn 28:** Move UP/RIGHT towards $A_C(9, 7)$.\n\nThe plan is simple: secure the corner apples while S1 handles the mess in the south.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples are at (3,0), (8,7), (9,7), (7,0), (8,1).\n\n**Step 1: Check each direction for immediate death.**\n- **UP** to (5,2): That's my own body (second segment). **NOT safe.**\n- **DOWN** to (5,0): Within board (0-9). Empty. Not my body. Not enemy #0's body. Safe.\n- **LEFT** to (4,1): Within board. Empty. Not my body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (6,1): Within board. Empty. Not my body. Not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**\nFrom (5,1):\n- **DOWN** to (5,0): Manhattan distance to nearest apple (3,0) = |5-3| + |0-0| = 2+0 = 2. Distance to (7,0) = 2+0 = 2.\n- **LEFT** to (4,1): Distance to (3,0) = |4-3| + |1-0| = 1+1 = 2. Distance to (8,1) = 4+0 = 4.\n- **RIGHT** to (6,1): Distance to (7,0) = |6-7| + |1-0| = 1+1 = 2. Distance to (8,1) = 2+0 = 2.\n\nAll three moves are equally close to an apple (distance 2). Need to consider which apple is more strategically valuable and which path offers better future mobility.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**\nIf I move **DOWN** to (5,0):\n- From (5,0) next turn:\n    - UP to (5,1): my body (second segment) - unsafe.\n    - DOWN: off board (y=-1) - unsafe.\n    - LEFT to (4,0): empty.\n    - RIGHT to (6,0): empty.\n- Safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT (only two exits). This is a bit restrictive, being on the bottom edge.\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (4,1):\n- From (4,1) next turn:\n    - UP to (4,2): empty.\n    - DOWN to (4,0): empty.\n    - LEFT to (3,1): empty.\n    - RIGHT to (5,1): my body (second segment) - unsafe.\n- Safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (three exits). Good flexibility, and I'm closer to the apple at (3,0).\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (6,1):\n- From (6,1) next turn:\n    - UP to (6,2): empty.\n    - DOWN to (6,0): empty.\n    - LEFT to (5,1): my body (second segment) - unsafe.\n    - RIGHT to (7,1): empty.\n- Safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (three exits). Good flexibility, and I'm closer to the apple at (7,0) and (8,1).\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions.**\nEnemy #0 head is at (5,7). Its body: [(4,7), (3,7), (3,8), (4,8), (5,8)].\nFrom (5,7), its safe moves:\n- UP to (5,8): its own body - unsafe.\n- DOWN to (5,6): empty.\n- LEFT to (4,7): its own body - unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (6,7): empty.\nSo its safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT. It's far away (distance >5), so no immediate collision risk.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and strategic choice.**\nMy lead is 7-5. I should consolidate by collecting the nearest apples while maintaining mobility. The apple at (3,0) is reachable in two moves via LEFT then DOWN. The apple at (7,0) is reachable in two moves via RIGHT then DOWN. Both are equally distant.\n\nHowever, moving LEFT to (4,1) seems slightly better than RIGHT because:\n1. From (4,1), I have three safe exits next turn, including DOWN to (4,0) which is adjacent to the apple at (3,0).\n2. My long body is mostly on the left side (columns 1-4), so moving left keeps me in a more open area of the board (right side is emptier, but that's fine).\n3. The enemy is in the top-right; moving left keeps me farther from it, reducing any chance of accidental encounter.\n\nMoving DOWN to (5,0) puts me on the edge with only two exits, which is riskier for future turns.\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:** From (4,1), I plan to move DOWN to (4,0) to get adjacent to the apple at (3,0), then eat it the following turn unless a better option appears.\n\n**Final choice:** LEFT",

S1 is still leading by 2 apples and is longer (length 8 vs 6).\n\n**Goal:** Capture the nearby apples $A_B(8, 7)$ and $A_C(9, 7)$.\n\n### 2. Identifying Targets and Distances\n\nH0 is at (6, 7). H1 is at (4, 1).\n\n| Apple | Position | H0 Distance (M) | H1 Distance (M) | Competition Score (H0-H1) |\n| :---: | :------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :---: |\n| $A_B$ | (8, 7) | $|6-8|+|7-7| = 2$ | $|4-8|+|1-7| = 10$ | -8 (H0 dominant, path initiated) |\n| $A_C$ | (9, 7) | $|6-9|+|7-7| = 3$ | $|4-9|+|1-7| = 11$ | -8 (H0 dominant) |\n| $A_E$ | (8, 1) | $|6-8|+|7-1| = 8$ | $|4-8|+|1-1| = 4$ | +4 (H1 dominant) |\n| $A_A$ | (3, 0) | $|6-3|+|7-0| = 10$ | $|4-3|+|1-0| = 2$ | +8 (H1 dominant) |\n| $A_D$ | (7, 0) | $|6-7|+|7-0| = 8$ | $|4-7|+|1-0| = 4$ | +4 (H1 dominant) |\n\nThe plan to capture $A_B(8, 7)$ is on track. H0 is 2 moves away.\n\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (6, 7)\n\nH0 is at (6, 7). Body sequence: (5, 7) is the neck. The tail (T0) will move from (4, 8) to (3, 8), clearing (4, 8).\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check (Self/Wall/Enemy Body) | Status |\n| :--: | :----------: | :------------------------------------: | :----: |\n| UP | (6, 8) | Safe (Empty) | Safe |\n| DOWN | (6, 6) | Safe (Empty) | Safe |\n| LEFT | (5, 7) | Hits immediate body segment (neck) | FATAL |\n| RIGHT | (7, 7) | Safe (Empty) | Safe (Optimal) |\n\n*   **LEFT to (5, 7)** is moving directly backwards into the neck. **FATAL.**\n*   All other three directions are safe from self/wall collision.\n\n### 4. Evaluating Safe Moves (H0)\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (7, 7):**\n    *   Moves one step closer to $A_B(8, 7)$ (Distance 1). This is the fastest approach.\n2.  **UP to (6, 8):**\n    *   Distance to $A_B(8, 7)$ becomes $|6-8|+|8-7| = 3$. Worse.\n3.  **DOWN to (6, 6):**\n    *   Distance to $A_B(8, 7)$ becomes $|6-8|+|6-7| = 3$. Worse.\n\n**Optimal Choice:** RIGHT to (7, 7).\n\n### 5. Collision Check (Head-on and Body)\n\n**H0 chosen move: RIGHT to (7, 7).**\n\n*   **H1 Analysis:** H1 is at (4, 1). It is currently surrounded by three apples in the south: $A_A(3, 0)$, $A_D(7, 0)$, $A_E(8, 1)$. The closest is $A_A(3, 0)$ (M=2) via LEFT/DOWN, or $A_D(7, 0)$ (M=4) via RIGHT/DOWN, or $A_E(8, 1)$ (M=4) via RIGHT/UP.\n    *   If H1 moves LEFT to (3, 1) or DOWN to (4, 0), it is moving away from H0.\n    *   The coordinate (7, 7) is far from H1's current activity (4, 1). There is essentially zero risk of a head-on collision or collision with H1's body segments.\n\nThe move is safe and keeps H0 perfectly positioned for the next turn's capture.\n\n### 6. Strategy Note for Future Turns\n\n1. **Turn 27 (Next Turn):** Move RIGHT to (8, 7) to capture $A_B$. Score 6-7.\n2. **Turn 28:** Move towards $A_C(9, 7)$. Since the head will be at (8, 7), the best path is UP (8, 8) or RIGHT (9, 7) if the wall permits. Since (8, 7) is $A_B$, the snake will grow, making a tight turn potentially hazardous if the tail doesn't clear. $A_C$ is at (9, 7). If I move RIGHT from (8, 7), I will hit $A_C$.\n\nPlan remains: Capture $A_B$, then $A_C$.\n\nRIGHT",

Also very close.\n\nDOWN and LEFT are both adjacent to the apple at (3,0) (distance 1). UP is farther.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**\nIf I move **DOWN** to (4,0):\n- From (4,0) next turn:\n    - UP to (4,1): my body (second segment) - unsafe.\n    - DOWN: off board (y=-1) - unsafe.\n    - LEFT to (3,0): apple!

That's very restrictive (only one exit). Moving UP now would trap me next turn.\n\nThus, UP is risky because it severely limits future mobility.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions.**\nEnemy #0 head at (6,7). Its safe moves (from last turn analysis): DOWN to (6,6) and RIGHT to (7,7). It's far away (distance >5), so no immediate collision risk. However, I must consider that apples at (8,7) and (9,7) are near the enemy, but I'm focused on the closer apple at (3,0).\n\n**Step 5: Decide between DOWN and LEFT.**\nBoth lead to being adjacent to apple (3,0). However, moving DOWN to (4,0) puts me on the bottom edge, which reduces exits to two. Moving LEFT to (3,1) keeps me off the edge and gives three exits next turn. Also, from (3,1), I can choose DOWN to eat the apple next turn, or go UP/LEFT if needed.\n\nMoreover, if I move DOWN to (4,0), the enemy could potentially move toward the apple at (7,0) or (8,1), but that's not a direct threat.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:** From (3,1), I plan to move DOWN to (3,0) to eat the apple, unless the enemy somehow threatens that cell. This will grow my snake and increase my lead to 8 apples.\n\nGiven the better mobility after moving LEFT, I choose LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

The RIGHT move captures $A_B$.\n\n### 4. Head-on Collision Check\n\nH0 is moving RIGHT to (8, 7).\n\nWe must predict H1's move from (3, 1). H1 is near $A_A(3, 0)$, $A_D(7, 0)$, and $A_E(8, 1)$.\n\n*   $A_A(3, 0)$ is the closest at M=1 (DOWN).\n*   Snake 1's neighbors: (4, 1) (neck), (3, 0) (Apple), (2, 1) (Empty), (3, 2) (Empty).\n*   Likely moves for H1: DOWN to (3, 0), capturing $A_A$.\n\nIf H1 moves DOWN to (3, 0), the collision risk with H0 at (8, 7) is zero.\n\n### 5.

H0 will likely be positioned high and to the right.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #0's head is at (7,7).\n\n**Step 1: Check each direction for immediate death.**\n- **UP** to (3,2): Within board (0-9). Cell is empty (`.`). Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n- **DOWN** to (3,0): Within board. Contains an apple (`A`). Eating an apple is safe (no collision with other snake bodies). **Safe.**\n- **LEFT** to (2,1): Within board. Empty. Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n- **RIGHT** to (4,1): Within board. That's my own body (second segment, `T`). **NOT safe.**\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**\nFrom (3,1):\n- **DOWN** to (3,0): This is an apple. I would eat it immediately, grow to 8 apples, and my tail would stay where it is (I grow by not removing the last segment this turn).\n- **LEFT** to (2,1): Distance to nearest apple (3,0) = |2-3| + |1-0| = 2.\n- **UP** to (3,2): Distance to nearest apple (3,0) = |3-3| + |2-0| = 2.\n\nDOWN is the only move that gets an apple this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**\nIf I move **DOWN** to (3,0) and eat the apple:\n- My new head is at (3,0). My body becomes: [(3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4)] (length 9).\n- From (3,0) next turn:\n    - UP to (3,1): That will be my *new* second segment (the old head). **This is my own body and would kill me.** (Moving backwards into your own body is fatal).\n    - DOWN: off board (y=-1) - unsafe.\n    - LEFT to (2,0): empty.\n    - RIGHT to (4,0): empty (apple at (7,0) is far away).\n- Safe moves next turn: LEFT, RIGHT. Two exits, but I'm on the bottom edge.\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (2,1):\n- From (2,1) next turn, I could go DOWN to (2,0) or LEFT to (1,1) or UP to (2,2). More options, but I miss the immediate apple.\n\nIf I move **UP** to (3,2):\n- From (3,2) next turn, options might be limited by my body nearby.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions.**\nEnemy head at (7,7). It is far away (Manhattan distance 4+6=10). No immediate collision risk. The apple I'm targeting (3,0) is far from the enemy. However, I must consider simultaneous moves: Could the enemy move into (3,0) this turn? From (7,7), it would take at least 7 moves. Impossible. So eating the apple is safe from enemy head-on collision.\n\n**Step 5: Decide.**\nThe primary objective is to collect apples safely. Moving DOWN gets an apple now, increasing my lead (8 vs enemy's 5). The risk is that next turn I'll be on the bottom edge with only two safe moves, but that's manageable. I should take the guaranteed apple.\n\nLong-term plan for next turn: After eating the apple at (3,0), my head will be at (3,0). My only safe moves will be LEFT to (2,0) or RIGHT to (4,0). I should choose the direction that opens more space and moves toward other apples (like (7,0) or (8,1)). Since (4,0) is closer to the center and to apple (7,0), I'll likely go RIGHT next turn, but will re-evaluate based on the new board.\n\nDOWN",

This is the preferred move.\n\n### 4. Head-on Collision Check\n\nH0 is moving RIGHT to (9, 7).\n\nWe must predict H1's move from (3, 0). H1 is likely looking for $A_B(7, 0)$ or $A_C(8, 1)$.\n\n*   $A_B(7, 0)$: M=4 (RIGHT x4).\n*   $A_C(8, 1)$: M=8 (e.g., UP, RIGHT x5, UP, RIGHT).\n*   The area around (9, 7) is distant and unlikely for H1.\n\nH1 must move away from the bottom wall if it wants to capture a new apple.\nPossible safe moves for H1 (3, 0): UP to (3, 1) (neck), LEFT to (2, 0), RIGHT to (4, 0).\n\n*   H1's body segments are (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (5, 2)...\n*   H1 moving UP to (3, 1) hits its neck.

Evaluating Safe Moves (H0)\n\nThe move **RIGHT to (9, 7)** captures an apple, increasing the score to 7, and extending our snake to length 8. This is the optimal move.\n\n### 6. Strategy Note for Future Turns\n\n1.  **Turn 29:** H0 will be at (9, 7) (Apple captured, length 8). Score 7 vs H1's 8.\n2.  Next targets: $A_D(8, 5)$ (M=3) and potentially $A_E(0, 8)$ (M=8).\n3.  From (9, 7), a move sequence: DOWN to (9, 6), DOWN to (9, 5), LEFT to (8, 5) captures $A_D$. We should start moving DOWN next turn.\n4.  Need to watch H1, which is cleaning up the bottom area (e.g., heading towards $A_B(7, 0)$). We are cornering ourselves slightly in the top right, but we have two apples secured in a row, which is worth the temporary corner.\n\nRIGHT",

Body: [(2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3), (3,3)] (tail (3,4) removed).\n- From (2,0) next turn, possible moves:\n    - UP to (2,1): Empty. **Safe.**\n    - DOWN: off board. **Not safe.**\n    - LEFT to (1,0): Empty. **Safe.**\n    - RIGHT to (3,0): That's my own body (second segment). **Not safe.**\n- Two safe moves next turn: UP and LEFT. This gives me more options and keeps me away from the right edge.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions.**\nEnemy snake #0 head at (8,7). It's far away (Manhattan distance from my head: |3-8|+|0-7|=12). No immediate collision risk. The enemy is near apples (9,7) and (8,5), but far from my area. No head-on collision possible this turn.\n\n**Step 5: Decide.**\nWhile RIGHT moves me closer to apple (7,0), it leaves me with only one safe move next turn (RIGHT to (5,0)), which could lead to a trap along the bottom edge. LEFT gives me two safe moves next turn (UP or LEFT), preserving more options and keeping me in a less constrained area. Survival and maintaining future mobility are more important than a slight proximity gain to a distant apple. I should choose LEFT to keep my options open.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:** After moving LEFT to (2,0), I'll have a choice between UP to (2,1) or LEFT to (1,0). I should assess which direction offers better access to apples and open space. The apple at (0,8) is far, but (7,0) is still a target. Moving UP might start working my way north while staying clear of my own body.\n\nLEFT",

Length 9.\n    *   Apples collected: 8.\n*   **Apples at:** $A_A(7, 0)$, $A_B(8, 1)$, $A_C(8, 5)$, $A_D(0, 8)$, $A_E(1, 8)$.\n\n**Scores:** S0 (7) vs S1 (8). S1 is leading by 1.\n\n**Board interpretation:** Coordinates are 0-indexed. (0,0) is bottom left.\n\n---\n### 2. Identifying Immediate Targets and Distances for H0 (9, 7)\n\nOur current position is the top-right corner. We successfully captured the apple at (9, 7) on the previous turn.\n\n| Apple | Position | H0 Distance (M) | Current Safest Path | H1 Distance (M) |\n| :---: | :------: | :-------------: | :-----------------: | :-------------: |\n| $A_C$ | (8, 5) | 3 | DOWN, LEFT, DOWN | 10 |\n| $A_B$ | (8, 1) | 7 | DOWN x6, LEFT | 3 |\n| $A_A$ | (7, 0) | 9 | DOWN x7, LEFT x2 | 5 |\n| $A_E$ | (1, 8) | 8 | UP, LEFT x8 | 10 |\n| $A_D$ | (0, 8) | 9 | UP, LEFT x9 | 10 |\n\nThe closest target is $A_C(8, 5)$, requiring 3 moves. This is the primary target. We must move away from the right wall.\n\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (9, 7)\n\nNeck is at (8, 7). Tail (T0) is at (3, 8).\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check (Self/Wall/Enemy Body) | Status |\n| :--: | :----------: | :------------------------------------: | :----: |\n| UP | (9, 8) | Safe (Empty) | Safe (but less flexible) |\n| DOWN | (9, 6) | Safe (Empty) | Safe (moves toward $A_C(8, 5)$) |\n| LEFT | (8, 7) | Hits immediate body segment (neck) | FATAL |\n| RIGHT | (10, 7) | Hits the wall (9 is max X) | FATAL |\n\nWe must eliminate LEFT and RIGHT. Only UP and DOWN are safe.\n\n*   **DOWN to (9, 6):** Advances toward $A_C(8, 5)$ (M=2 from there). Keeps the snake aligned near the right edge momentarily but opens path for diagonal movement. (9, 6) is key for the next stage of the path.\n*   **UP to (9, 8):** Moves further into the top-right corner. Increases distance to $A_C(8, 5)$ (M=4 from there). Less appealing.\n\n### 4. Head-on Collision and H1 Prediction\n\nH1 is at (2, 0). H1's neck is (3, 0). H1 is currently highly focused on the bottom two apples: $A_A(7, 0)$ (M=5) and $A_B(8, 1)$ (M=3). The priority target for H1 is likely $A_B(8, 1)$.\n\nH1 (2, 0) safe moves:\n1. RIGHT to (3, 0): Hits neck. FATAL.\n2. UP to (2, 1): Safe, begins movement towards $A_B(8, 1)$.\n3. LEFT to (1, 0): Safe, away from the body/wall.\n4. DOWN to (2, -1): Hits wall. FATAL.\n\nH1 must move UP or LEFT. Given the proximity of $A_B(8, 1)$, H1 is expected to move **UP to (2, 1)** or **LEFT to (1, 0)**.\n\nRegardless of H1's move, H0 moving to (9, 6) poses no collision risk as H1 is far away on the bottom or bottom-left of the board.\n\n### 5. Evaluating Safe Moves (H0)\n\nThe move **DOWN** to (9, 6) sets up the path for $A_C(8, 5)$ most efficiently. The path would be:\nT29: DOWN to (9, 6)\nT30: LEFT to (8, 6)\nT31: DOWN to (8, 5) (Capture $A_C$)\n\nThis is a clear short-term plan to gain the lead.\n\n### 6. Strategy Note for Future Turns (Plan)\n\n1. **Turn 30:** Move LEFT from (9, 6) to (8, 6) to position for $A_C(8, 5)$.\n2. **Turn 31:** Move DOWN from (8, 6) to (8, 5) to capture $A_C$. S0 will take the lead (8 vs 8, potentially 9 vs 8 if H1 gets one).\n3. After capturing $A_C$, evaluate the two northern apples $A_D(0, 8)$ and $A_E(1, 8)$. If H1 moves south, we can secure the north.\n\nDOWN",

I did not eat an apple last turn, so my length remains 9.\n\n**Step 1: Check each direction for immediate death.**\n- **UP** to (2,1): Within board. Cell is empty (`.`). Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n- **DOWN** to (2,-1): Outside board (y < 0). **NOT safe.**\n- **LEFT** to (1,0): Within board. Cell is empty (`.`). Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n- **RIGHT** to (3,0): That's my own body (the segment immediately behind my head). Moving backwards into my own body is fatal. **NOT safe.**\n\nOnly safe moves: UP, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**\nApples at: (7,0), (8,1), (8,5), (0,8), (1,8).\nFrom my head at (2,0):\n- **UP** to (2,1): Manhattan distances to apples: (7,0)=6, (8,1)=8, (8,5)=10, (0,8)=9, (1,8)=8. Closest is (7,0) with distance 6.\n- **LEFT** to (1,0): Distances: (7,0)=6, (8,1)=8, (8,5)=12, (0,8)=9, (1,8)=8. Closest is (7,0) with distance 6.\n\nBoth moves keep the same distance to the nearest apple (7,0). However, the apple at (1,8) is also 8 away from (1,0), same as from (2,1). No clear proximity advantage.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**\nIf I move **UP** to (2,1):\n- My new head will be at (2,1). My body will be: [(2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)] (tail (3,3) removed).\n- From (2,1) next turn, possible moves:\n    - UP to (2,2): Empty. **Safe.**\n    - DOWN to (2,0): That's my own body (second segment). **Not safe.**\n    - LEFT to (1,1): Empty. **Safe.**\n    - RIGHT to (3,1): That's my own body (fourth segment). **Not safe.**\n- Two safe moves next turn: UP and LEFT. This opens up the board northward.\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (1,0):\n- My new head at (1,0). Body: [(1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (4,3)] (tail (3,3) removed).\n- From (1,0) next turn, possible moves:\n    - UP to (1,1): Empty. **Safe.**\n    - DOWN: off board. **Not safe.**\n    - LEFT to (0,0): Empty. **Safe.**\n    - RIGHT to (2,0): That's my own body (second segment). **Not safe.**\n- Two safe moves next turn: UP and LEFT. Similar to moving UP, but I'm closer to the left edge.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions.**\nEnemy snake #0 head at (9,7). It's far away (Manhattan distance from my head: |2-9|+|0-7|=14). No immediate collision risk. The enemy is near apples (9,7) and (8,5). It might move towards (8,5) or (0,8), but far from my area. No head-on collision possible this turn.\n\n**Step 5: Decide and long-term plan.**\nBoth UP and LEFT give me two safe moves next turn. However, moving UP to (2,1) gets me off the bottom edge, which is a constrained area, and opens a path northward towards the cluster of apples at (0,8) and (1,8) in the top-left. Moving LEFT to (1,0) keeps me on the bottom edge, which is riskier long-term because I have only one row to maneuver (y=0). If I go LEFT, my only safe moves next turn are UP or LEFT again, but if I go LEFT again to (0,0), I'll be in a corner with only UP as a safe move, potentially trapping myself.\n\nUP gives me more vertical space to work with. The long-term plan should be to gradually work my way north and west towards the apples at (0,8) and (1,8), while keeping an eye on the apple at (7,0) as a possible target if I loop around. I should avoid getting trapped along the edges.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After moving UP to (2,1), I'll have a choice between UP to (2,2) or LEFT to (1,1). I should prefer UP to continue gaining vertical space and move towards the top-left apple cluster, while assessing the safety of each move.\n\nUP",

Head-on Collision and H1 Prediction\n\nH1 is at (2, 1). H1's body segments are (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), etc.\n\nH1's primary target is likely $A_B(8, 1)$ (M=3), or $A_A(7, 0)$ (M=5).\n\nH1's safe moves from (2, 1):\n1. UP to (2, 2): Safe. Moves toward the center.\n2. LEFT to (1, 1): Safe. Moves away from the body block (3, 1).\n3. RIGHT to (3, 1): Hits neck (3, 1). FATAL.\n4. DOWN to (2, 0): Hits body segment (2, 0). FATAL.\n\nH1 must move UP or LEFT. Given the proximity and importance of $A_B(8, 1)$, H1 will likely prioritize moving UP or LEFT to set up a path across the bottom of the board.\n\nIf H1 moves UP to (2, 2) or LEFT to (1, 1), there is absolutely no threat to H0 as H0 is far away at (9, 6).\n\n---\n### 5. Evaluating Optimal Move (H0)\n\nMoving **LEFT to (8, 6)** is critical for capturing $A_C(8, 5)$ in two turns:\nT30: (9, 6) -> (8, 6) [Move LEFT]\nT31: (8, 6) -> (8, 5) [Move DOWN, Capture $A_C$]\n\nThis path is efficient and collision-free.\n\n### 6. Strategy Note for Future Turns (Plan)\n\n1. **Turn 31:** Move DOWN from (8, 6) to (8, 5) to capture $A_C$. S0 will tie or take the lead (8 apples).\n2. After capturing $A_C$, evaluate the two northern apples $A_D(0, 8)$ and $A_E(1, 8)$ which are now M=5 and M=6 away, respectively. H1 is committed to the bottom section. Securing the north corner is the next priority. The next move should be deciding between UP to (8, 6) or LEFT to (7, 5).\n\nLEFT",

Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n- **DOWN** to (2,0): That's my own body (the segment immediately behind my head).

Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n- **RIGHT** to (3,1): That's my own body (the fourth segment). **NOT safe.**\n\nOnly safe moves: UP, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**\nApples at: (7,0), (8,1), (8,5), (0,8), (1,8).\nFrom my head at (2,1):\n- **UP** to (2,2): Manhattan distances to apples: (7,0)=7, (8,1)=8, (8,5)=9, (0,8)=8, (1,8)=6.

My body will be: [(2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)] (tail (4,3) removed).\n- From (2,2) next turn, possible moves:\n    - UP to (2,3): Empty. **Safe.**\n    - DOWN to (2,1): That's my own body (second segment). **Not safe.**\n    - LEFT to (1,2): Empty. **Safe.**\n    - RIGHT to (3,2): Empty. **Safe.**\n- Three safe moves next turn: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.

Body: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)] (tail (4,3) removed).\n- From (1,1) next turn, possible moves:\n    - UP to (1,2): Empty. **Safe.**\n    - DOWN to (1,0): Empty. **Safe.**\n    - LEFT to (0,1): Empty. **Safe.**\n    - RIGHT to (2,1): That's my own body (second segment). **Not safe.**\n- Three safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT. Also good, but positions me closer to the left edge.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions.**\nEnemy snake #0 head at (9,6). It's far away (Manhattan distance from my head: |2-9|+|1-6|=12). No immediate collision risk. The enemy is near apples (8,5) and might move towards it. It's unlikely to intersect my path this turn.\n\n**Step 5: Decide and long-term plan.**\nBoth moves are safe and offer three future options. However, moving UP to (2,2) continues my northward progression toward the top-left apple cluster (0,8)/(1,8), which is a strategic goal. It also keeps me more central, avoiding the left edge where I could get pinned. Moving LEFT to (1,1) is also fine, but UP seems more aligned with the long-term objective of reaching the high-value area.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Continue moving generally north and west toward the apples at (0,8) and (1,8). After moving UP to (2,2), I'll have three safe choices. I should prefer UP or LEFT to advance toward that cluster, while always checking for immediate safety. Avoid getting trapped along the bottom or left edges. Monitor enemy #0's position\u2014it's far away but could eventually compete for the top-left apples.\n\nUP",

We are behind by 1 apple.\n\n**Objective:** Capture $A_C(8, 5)$ immediately, as planned.\n\n---\n### 2. Identifying Immediate Targets and Distances for H0 (8, 6)\n\nOur current position is (8, 6). The neck is at (9, 6).\n\n| Apple | Position | H0 Manhattan Distance | Notes | H1 Manhattan Distance (2, 2) |\n| :---: | :------: | :-------------------: | :-------------------: | :--------------------------: |\n| $A_C$ | (8, 5) | 1 | **Immediate target.** | 13 |\n| $A_B$ | (8, 1) | 5 | Next closest apple. | 7 |\n| $A_A$ | (7, 0) | 7 | | 9 |\n| $A_E$ | (1, 8) | 8 | | 7 |\n| $A_D$ | (0, 8) | 9 | | 8 |\n\n---\n### 3.

Head-on Collision and H1 Prediction\n\nH1 is at (2, 2). H0 is moving to (8, 5). Collision is impossible.\n\nH1's safe moves from (2, 2) (Neck 2, 1):\n1. UP to (2, 3): Safe.\n2. LEFT to (1, 2): Safe.\n3. RIGHT to (3, 2): Safe.\n4. DOWN to (2, 1): Hits neck (2, 1). FATAL.\n\nH1 will likely choose UP or RIGHT to continue south-east toward $A_B(8, 1)$ or $A_A(7, 0)$.\n\n*   If H1 moves UP to (2, 3), it increases distance to southern apples.\n*   If H1 moves RIGHT to (3, 2), it maintains proximity to southern apples.\n\nGiven Snake 1 is currently in the lead and the southern apples are critical for maintaining that lead, H1 is highly motivated to move RIGHT or UP/RIGHT to bypass its body and move toward the large empty space in the center/bottom. For instance, a sequence like (2, 2) -> (3, 2) -> (4, 2) provides good options for the future.\n\nRegardless of H1's move, H0 captures $A_C$ safely.\n\n---\n### 5. Evaluating Optimal Move (H0)\n\nThe move DOWN to (8, 5) captures the apple, giving us 8 apples, tied with Snake 1. This is the optimal move.\n\n### 6. Strategy Note for Future Turns (Plan)\n\nNow that we have secured $A_C(8, 5)$, we are tied for the lead. The next set of apples involves $A_B(8, 1)$ and $A_A(7, 0)$ in the south, and $A_D(0, 8)$ and $A_E(1, 8)$ in the north.\n\nH1 is committed to the center/south. Our snake is lengthy (9 segments) and currently occupies the right edge (8, 5).\n\nWe should next aim for the northern apples, $A_E(1, 8)$ or $A_D(0, 8)$, as they are less contested. From (8, 5), the path is:\nT32: (8, 5) -> (8, 4) or (7, 5).\nIf we go LEFT to (7, 5), the path to the north is long. If we go DOWN to (8, 4), we move closer to the southern apples, which might conflict with H1.\n\nHowever, moving LEFT to (7, 5) is less risky than traversing the full length of the board to the north. But given the current board structure, moving UP/LEFT toward the northern apples seems best to keep distance from H1 and secure the less contested side.\n\nPlan:\n1. Move UP to (8, 6) to re-position after eating the apple.\n2. Then move LEFT and UP towards $A_D(0, 8)$ or $A_E(1, 8)$.\n\nDOWN",

Closest is (7,0) with distance 6.\n\nUP and LEFT keep me close to the top-left apple cluster (0,8)/(1,8).

This is more restrictive.\n\nRIGHT is less desirable because it reduces future options.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions.**\nEnemy snake #0 head at (8,6). It's far away (Manhattan distance from my head: |2-8|+|2-6|=10). No immediate collision risk. The enemy is near apple (8,5) and might move toward it or other apples. It's unlikely to intersect my path this turn.\n\n**Step 5: Decide and long-term plan.**\nBoth UP and LEFT are safe and offer three future options. UP continues my northward progression toward the top-left apple cluster (0,8)/(1,8), which is a strategic goal from my last plan. LEFT also moves me toward that cluster but along the edge. Moving UP keeps me more central, avoiding the left edge where I could get pinned. Given my last rationale's plan to \"continue moving generally north and west toward the apples,\" UP aligns perfectly.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Continue moving generally north and west toward the apples at (0,8) and (1,8). After moving UP to (2,3), I'll have three safe choices. I should prefer UP or LEFT to advance toward that cluster, while always checking for immediate safety. Avoid getting trapped along the edges. Monitor enemy #0's position\u2014it's far away but could eventually compete for the top-left apples.\n\nUP",

Length 9.\n    *   Apples collected: 8.\n    *   Neck: (2, 2).\n*   **Apples at:** $A_A(7, 0)$, $A_B(8, 1)$, $A_D(0, 8)$, $A_E(1, 8)$, $A_F(6, 2)$.\n\n**Scores:** S0 (8) vs S1 (8). We are tied.\n\n**Objective:** Secure the next apple, preferably one uncontested by H1. The Northern apples $A_D(0, 8)$ and $A_E(1, 8)$ are far from H1, which is currently at (2, 3). The Southern apples $A_A(7, 0)$, $A_B(8, 1)$, and $A_F(6, 2)$ are closer to H1.\n\n---\n### 2. Identifying Immediate Targets and Distances for H0 (8, 5)\n\nOur current position is (8, 5).\n\n| Apple | Position | H0 Manhattan Distance | Notes | H1 Manhattan Distance (2, 3) |\n| :---: | :------: | :-------------------: | :-------------------: | :--------------------------: |\n| $A_B$ | (8, 1) | 4 | Closest contested south apple. | 8 |\n| $A_A$ | (7, 0) | 6 | Contested south apple. | 8 |\n| $A_F$ | (6, 2) | 5 | Contested central apple. | 3 (Very Close!) |\n| $A_E$ | (1, 8) | 10 | Uncontested north apple. | 8 |\n| $A_D$ | (0, 8) | 11 | Uncontested north apple. | 9 |\n\nH1 is extremely close to $A_F(6, 2)$ at a distance of 3, while we are at 5. H1 will almost certainly head for $A_F$. We must avoid the southern half for now and aim North.\n\nTarget: $A_E(1, 8)$ or $A_D(0, 8)$. $A_E(1, 8)$ is slightly closer (10 vs 11).\n\n---\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (8, 5)\n\nNeck is at (8, 6).\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check (Self/Wall/Enemy Body) | Status | Rationale |\n| :--: | :----------: | :------------------------------------: | :----: | :--------: |\n| UP | (8, 6) | Hits immediate body segment (neck). | FATAL | Backwards move. |\n| DOWN | (8, 4) | Safe (Empty) | Safe | Moves south, toward contested territory. |\n| LEFT | (7, 5) | Safe (Empty) | Safe | Good direction to travel North-West. |\n| RIGHT | (9, 5) | Safe (Empty) | Safe | Maintains position on right edge, blocks movement right. |\n\n**Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n\n1.  **LEFT (7, 5):** This moves us toward the open center-west side of the board and gives us better routes to the Northern apples. It prepares for a subsequent UP or LEFT move to snake across the board.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 4):** Moves us directly toward the southern apples (which H1 is also moving towards, specifically $A_F$). This leads to a longer snake traversal to the North later, or a risky competition with H1 for the southern apples.\n3.  **RIGHT (9, 5):** Blocks ourselves into the corner. Not ideal for long-distance travel. Future moves from (9, 5) must be LEFT/UP/DOWN.\n\nThe best strategic move is **LEFT** to (7, 5) to begin traversing West, establishing a path toward the uncontested North-West apples.\n\n---\n### 4. Head-on Collision and H1 Prediction\n\nH1 is at (2, 3), Neck at (2, 2). H1 is highly motivated to move towards $A_F(6, 2)$.\n\nPossible Safe Moves for H1:\n1.  **UP (2, 4):** Safe. Moves away from all close apples. Unlikely.\n2.  **DOWN (2, 2):** Hits neck. FATAL.\n3.  **LEFT (1, 3):** Safe. Favorable for reaching $A_E$ later, but inefficient for $A_F(6, 2)$.\n4.  **RIGHT (3, 3):** Safe. This is the most efficient path toward $A_F(6, 2)$ (distance 3 followed by 1). Highly likely.\n\nIf H1 moves RIGHT to (3, 3), and H0 moves LEFT to (7, 5), there is no immediate threat of collision. H1 will likely capture $A_F(6, 2)$ next turn or the turn after.\n\nWe confirm our move LEFT is safe regardless of H1's choice.\n\n---\n### 5. Strategy Note for Future Turns (Plan)\n\nH1 will likely get $A_F(6, 2)$. We need to focus on the Northern apples $A_E(1, 8)$ and $A_D(0, 8)$.\n\nCurrent position: (7, 5).\nPlan: Move LEFT toward the middle. Then UP to begin hugging the long path toward (1, 8).\n\nT33: From (7, 5), move LEFT to (6, 5).\nT34: From (6, 5), move UP to (6, 6).\nT35: From (6, 6), move UP to (6, 7). (Self-collision risk is past, as the tail will have moved).\n... continue North-West.\n\nThe move LEFT is the correct setup move.\n\nLEFT",

My body: [(2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2)].  \n- **UP** to (2,4): Within board. Cell is empty (`.`). Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**  \n- **DOWN** to (2,2): That\u2019s my own body (segment immediately behind head). Moving backwards into own body is fatal. **NOT safe.**  \n- **LEFT** to (1,3): Within board. Cell is empty. Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**  \n- **RIGHT** to (3,3): Within board. Cell is empty. Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**  \n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**  \nApples at: (7,0), (8,1), (0,8), (1,8), (6,2).  \nFrom my head (2,3):  \n- **UP** to (2,4): Manhattan distances: (7,0)=9, (8,1)=10, (0,8)=6, (1,8)=5, (6,2)=5. Closest are (1,8) dist 5 and (6,2) dist 5.  \n- **LEFT** to (1,3): Distances: (7,0)=9, (8,1)=11, (0,8)=5, (1,8)=4, (6,2)=6. Closest is (1,8) dist 4.  \n- **RIGHT** to (3,3): Distances: (7,0)=7, (8,1)=9, (0,8)=8, (1,8)=7, (6,2)=4. Closest is (6,2) dist 4.  \n\nLEFT moves me closest to the top-left apple cluster (1,8). RIGHT moves me toward (6,2), which is nearby but in an area with more of my own body segments. UP keeps both clusters reachable.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**  \nIf I move **UP** to (2,4):  \n- New body: [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)] (tail (5,2) removed).  \n- From (2,4) next turn:  \n    - UP to (2,5): Empty.

Good.\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (1,3):  \n- New body: [(1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)] (tail (5,2) removed).  \n- From (1,3) next turn:  \n    - UP to (1,4): Empty. Safe.  \n    - DOWN to (1,2): Empty. Safe.  \n    - LEFT to (0,3): Empty. Safe.  \n    - RIGHT to (2,3): My body (second segment). Not safe.  \n- Three safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN, LEFT. Good.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (3,3):  \n- New body: [(3,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)] (tail (5,2) removed).  \n- From (3,3) next turn:  \n    - UP to (3,4): Empty. Safe.  \n    - DOWN to (3,2): Empty? Board shows '.' at (3,2). Safe.  \n    - LEFT to (2,3): My body (second segment). Not safe.  \n    - RIGHT to (4,3): Empty. Safe.  \n- Three safe moves next turn: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Good.\n\nAll three safe moves give three future safe options.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions.**  \nEnemy snake #0 head at (8,5). Manhattan distance from my head: |2-8|+|3-5|=8. No immediate collision risk. Enemy could move toward apple (6,2) or (8,1). If I move RIGHT toward (6,2), I might compete with enemy for that apple, increasing risk of head-on collision if we both aim for it. Safer to pursue the top-left apples (0,8)/(1,8) where enemy is farther away.\n\n**Step 5: Decide and long-term plan.**  \nMy last plan was to \u201ccontinue moving generally north and west toward the apples at (0,8) and (1,8).\u201d  \n- **UP** advances north, keeping central flexibility.  \n- **LEFT** moves west, closer to (1,8) but edges me toward left wall.  \n- **RIGHT** moves away from my target cluster and toward potential enemy competition.  \n\nBetween UP and LEFT, both are safe and align with the plan. UP gives slightly more central maneuvering room, while LEFT gets me closer to the apple faster. Since the apple at (1,8) is only 4 moves away via LEFT, and enemy is far, I\u2019ll choose LEFT to efficiently close the distance while keeping future options open.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Continue moving west/north toward (1,8). After moving LEFT to (1,3), next turn I can go UP to (1,4) or LEFT to (0,3) to approach the apple while monitoring enemy #0\u2019s movement. Avoid getting pinned against the left edge\u2014if needed, use UP to stay flexible.\n\nLEFT",

Tied.\n\n**Objective:** Continue moving toward the uncontested Northern apples: $A_D(0, 8)$ (distance 11) or $A_E(1, 8)$ (distance 10). $A_F(6, 2)$ is still highly likely to be captured by H1.\n\n---\n### 2. Identifying Immediate Targets and Distances for H0 (7, 5)\n\nOur current path is focused on setting up a long run to the North-West. The last move was LEFT to (7, 5).\n\n| Apple | Position | H0 Manhattan Distance (7, 5) | H1 Manhattan Distance (1, 3) | Notes |\n| :---: | :------: | :--------------------------: | :--------------------------: | :---------------------------------------: |\n| $A_B$ | (8, 1) | 5 | 9 | South, contested. |\n| $A_A$ | (7, 0) | 5 | 9 | South, contested. |\n| $A_F$ | (6, 2) | 4 | 4 | **Immediate Contest!** H1 is exactly 4 steps away, same as us.

This move puts H1 exactly 4 steps away from $A_F(6, 2)$ and 5 steps away from $A_E(1, 8)$.\n\n*   H0 is currently at (7, 5), distance 4 to $A_F(6, 2)$.\n*   H1 is currently at (1, 3), distance 4 to $A_F(6, 2)$.\n\nSince we are now tied for the distance to $A_F$, a race may occur, but H1 also has a much shorter path to $A_E(1, 8)$ and $A_D(0, 8)$ now.\n\n**Revised Strategy:** We must race H1 for $A_F(6, 2)$ OR immediately commit to the other apples that H1 is now closer to. Since H1 made an unexpected move to (1, 3), they may be trying to establish control over the West side. This makes the race for $A_F$ viable, but reaching the Northern apples $A_D/A_E$ extremely unlikely.\n\nLet's assume H1 targets the closest apple which is $A_F(6, 2)$, since it offers the biggest potential gain in the score race.\n\n---\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (7, 5)\n\nNeck is at (8, 5).\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check (Self/Wall/Enemy Body) | Status | Rationale |\n| :--: | :----------: | :------------------------------------: | :----: | :--------: |\n| UP | (7, 6) | Safe (Empty) | Safe | Good setup for future North/East movement. |\n| DOWN | (7, 4) | Safe (Empty) | Safe | Moves toward $A_F(6, 2)$ via (6, 4) or (7, 3). |\n| LEFT | (6, 5) | Safe (Empty) | Safe | Good setup for $A_F(6, 2)$ via (6, 5) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 3) -> (6, 2). |\n| RIGHT | (8, 5) | Hits immediate body segment (neck). | FATAL | Backwards move. |\n\n**Safe Moves Analysis:**\n\n1.  **LEFT (6, 5):** Optimal path to $A_F(6, 2)$ in 4 turns minimum: (6, 5) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 3) -> (6, 2).\n2.  **DOWN (7, 4):** Not optimal for $A_F$. Path complexity increases.\n3.  **UP (7, 6):** Moves away from all apples. This would commit to letting H1 take $A_F$ and prepare for a very long safe path, likely resulting in H1 leading the score heavily. Given the score tie, we should contest $A_F$.\n\n**Decision:** We must go for $A_F(6, 2)$ by moving **LEFT**.\n\n---\n### 4. H1 Prediction and Collision Check\n\nH1 is at (1, 3). Body [(2, 3), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1)]. Neck is (2, 3).\n\nH1 has distance 4 to $A_F(6, 2)$.\n*   Optimal H1 path to $A_F$: (1, 3) -> (2, 3) [FATAL, neck]. (1, 3) -> (2, 3) is backward.\n*   Safe H1 moves: UP (1, 4), DOWN (1, 2), RIGHT (2, 3).\n*   H1 *must* move UP (1, 4) or DOWN (1, 2) or LEFT (0, 3) or RIGHT (2, 3). Wait, (2, 3) is H1's neck. **H1 CANNOT move RIGHT to (2, 3), as that space is occupied by its neck.**\n\nPossible Safe Moves for H1:\n1.  **UP (1, 4):** Safe. Distance to $A_F(6, 2)$ increases to 5.\n2.  **DOWN (1, 2):** Safe. Distance to $A_F(6, 2)$ increases to 5.\n3.  **LEFT (0, 3):** Safe. Distance to $A_F(6, 2)$ increases to 8.\n\nH1 is currently moving along the West side of the board. All moves UP, DOWN, or LEFT increase H1's Manhattan distance to $A_F(6, 2)$. This suggests H1 has actually committed to the West side/Northern apples, *not* $A_F$, despite $A_F$ being the closest apple by far.\n\nLet's re-evaluate H1's distance to the Northern apples from (1, 3):\n*   To $A_E(1, 8)$: 5 steps (UP 5 times). A very short path.\n*   To $A_D(0, 8)$: 6 steps.\n\nIf H1 moves **UP (1, 4)**, the distance to $A_E$ becomes 4.\nIf H1 moves **LEFT (0, 3)**, the distance to $A_E$ becomes 6 (or 5 to $A_D$).\n\nGiven H1's recent move to the West side and the excellent opportunity $A_E(1, 8)$ presents (only 5 steps away), it is highly likely H1 will now move UP towards $A_E$.\n\n**If H1 targets $A_E(1, 8)$ (move UP to (1, 4)), and H0 moves LEFT to (6, 5), there are no collisions.**\n\nSince H1's previous move (2, 3) -> (1, 3) essentially abandoned the fast path to $A_F$, $A_F$ is now effectively uncontested by H1.\n\nH0 takes the easy apple $A_F(6, 2)$ by moving LEFT.\n\n---\n### 5. Strategy Note for Future Turns (Plan)\n\nH1 has moved West and is now primarily focused on the Northern Apples $A_D(0, 8)$ and $A_E(1, 8)$. We should capitalize on H1 abandoning the center-south by securing $A_F(6, 2)$, $A_B(8, 1)$, and $A_A(7, 0)$ sequentially if safe.\n\nCurrent position: (7, 5). Target $A_F(6, 2)$.\nT34: (6, 5) -> (6, 4)\nT35: (6, 4) -> (6, 3)\nT36: (6, 3) -> (6, 2) (Capture $A_F$)\n\nAfter that, pursue $A_A(7, 0)$ or $A_B(8, 1)$.\n\nLEFT",

Moving backwards into own body is fatal. **NOT safe.**  \n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**  \nApples at: (7,0), (8,1), (0,8), (1,8), (6,2).  \nFrom my head (1,3):  \n- **UP** to (1,4): Manhattan distances: (7,0)=10, (8,1)=11, (0,8)=4, (1,8)=3, (6,2)=6.

Closest is (1,8) dist 4.  \n\nUP gets me closest to the apple at (1,8) (distance 3 after move). LEFT also moves toward that cluster but slightly farther.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**  \nIf I move **UP** to (1,4):  \n- New body: [(1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (4,1)] (tail (5,1) removed).  \n- From (1,4) next turn:  \n    - UP to (1,5): Empty.

This pins me against the left wall, reducing options.\n\nThus, UP gives three future safe moves, DOWN gives two, LEFT gives two. UP is best for maintaining flexibility.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions.**  \nEnemy snake #0 head at (7,5). Manhattan distance from my head: |1-7|+|3-5|=8. No immediate collision risk. Enemy is far and likely moving toward apples (6,2) or (8,1). Moving UP toward (1,8) keeps me away from enemy\u2019s probable path.\n\n**Step 5: Decide and long-term plan.**  \nMy last plan was to \u201ccontinue moving west/north toward (1,8).\u201d Moving UP advances north and keeps me central, with three safe follow-up moves. It also puts me just two steps away from the apple at (1,8) (UP to (1,4), then UP to (1,5), then UP to (1,6), then UP to (1,7), then UP to (1,8) \u2014 actually 5 steps, but still the closest safe approach). More importantly, UP avoids the left-wall trap and preserves options.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Continue moving north toward the apple cluster at (1,8) and (0,8). After UP to (1,4), next turn I can go UP again to (1,5) or move LEFT/RIGHT to avoid getting pinned. Monitor enemy #0\u2019s movement\u2014if it heads toward (6,2), that\u2019s fine. Stay flexible and avoid dead-ends.\n\nUP",

Tied.\n\n**Last Move Analysis (Turn 33):** H0 moved **LEFT** from (7, 5) to (6, 5). This was a commitment to acquire the central apple, $A_F(6, 2)$, based on the prediction that H1 was abandoning the race for it.\n*   H1 moved **UP** from (1, 3) to (1, 4). This confirms H1 is prioritizing the Western/Northern apples ($A_E(1, 8)$).\n\n---\n### 2. Identifying Immediate Targets and Distances for H0 (6, 5)\n\nOur primary target is $A_F(6, 2)$.\n\n| Apple | Position | H0 Manhattan Distance (6, 5) | H1 Manhattan Distance (1, 4) | Notes |\n| :---: | :------: | :--------------------------: | :--------------------------: | :---------------------------------------: |\n| $A_F$ | (6, 2) | 3 | 7 | **Primary Target.** Nearly uncontested. |\n| $A_E$ | (1, 8) | 8 | 4 | H1 is much closer. |\n| $A_D$ | (0, 8) | 9 | 5 | H1 is much closer. |\n| $A_A$ | (7, 0) | 6 | 10 | Secondary target (after $A_F$). |\n| $A_B$ | (8, 1) | 6 | 9 | Secondary target (after $A_F$). |\n\nH0 is 3 steps away from $A_F(6, 2)$.\nPath: (6, 5) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 3) -> (6, 2).\nCapture expected at Turn 36.\n\n---\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (6, 5)\n\nNeck is at (7, 5).\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check (Self/Wall/Enemy Body) | Status | Rationale |\n| :--: | :----------: | :------------------------------------: | :----: | :--------: |\n| UP | (6, 6) | Safe (Empty) | Safe | Deviates from $A_F$. |\n| DOWN | (6, 4) | Safe (Empty) | Safe | **Optimal path to $A_F$.** |\n| LEFT | (5, 5) | Safe (Empty) | Safe | Deviates from $A_F$. |\n| RIGHT | (7, 5) | Hits immediate body segment (neck). | FATAL | Backwards move. |\n\nThe clear choice to secure $A_F(6, 2)$ efficiently is **DOWN** to (6, 4). This advances us along the optimal path without risking unnecessary detours or wall/self-traps.\n\n---\n### 4. H1 Prediction and Collision Check\n\nH1 is at (1, 4). Neck is (1, 3).\nH1 is highly likely to continue UP towards $A_E(1, 8)$ (distance 4), or perhaps LEFT towards $A_D(0, 8)$ (distance 5).\n\nPossible moves for H1 (1, 4): UP (1, 5), LEFT (0, 4), RIGHT (2, 4). DOWN (1, 3) is fatal (neck).\n\n1.  **H1 chooses UP (1, 5):** Distance to $A_E$ becomes 3. Best strategic move for H1.\n2.  **H1 chooses LEFT (0, 4):** Distance to $A_D$ becomes 4. Also good.\n3.  **H1 chooses RIGHT (2, 4):** Moves away from northern targets. Less likely.\n\nIf H0 moves **DOWN** to (6, 4), and H1 moves **UP** to (1, 5), the distance between heads is still substantial. There are no collision conflicts with H1's body either, as the body is concentrated around the western edge and y=0,1 (1, 3), (2, 3)...(4, 1).\n\n**Safety Conclusion:** Moving DOWN to (6, 4) is safe and optimal for our current objective.\n\n---\n### 5. Strategy Note for Future Turns (Plan)\n\nImmediate objective is to capture $A_F(6, 2)$ in two more turns (T36).\n*   T34: Move DOWN to (6, 4).\n*   T35: Move DOWN to (6, 3).\n*   T36: Move DOWN to (6, 2) (Capture $A_F$).\n\nOnce $A_F$ is captured, the body will have grown to length 10, extending towards (6, 7). The heads will be at (6, 2). The next highly available apples are $A_A(7, 0)$ and $A_B(8, 1)$. We should maneuver to secure these next, assuming H1 is busy on the West side. H1 will likely capture $A_E(1, 8)$ and $A_D(0, 8)$ in the meantime. We must maximize our capture rate in the South/East while H1 is isolated in the North/West.\n\nDOWN",

H1 Prediction and Collision Check (H1 at 1, 5)\n\nH1 is at (1, 5). Neck is (1, 4). H1 is positioned perfectly to attack the northern apples ($A_E$ at 1, 8 or $A_D$ at 0, 8).\n\nPossible moves for H1 (1, 5): UP (1, 6), LEFT (0, 5), RIGHT (2, 5). DOWN (1, 4) is fatal (neck).\n\n1.  **H1 chooses UP (1, 6):** Advances toward $A_E(1, 8)$, distance 2. Most likely.\n2.  **H1 chooses LEFT (0, 5):** Advances toward $A_D(0, 8)$, distance 3 (if it moves left then up).\n3.  **H1 chooses RIGHT (2, 5):** Moves away from all nearby apples. Unlikely.\n\nIf H0 moves **DOWN** to (6, 3), and H1 moves **UP** to (1, 6), the snakes remain far apart. There are no collision risks.\n\n**Safety Conclusion:** Moving DOWN to (6, 3) is safe and maintains our primary strategic objective.\n\n---\n### 5. Strategy Note for Future Turns (Plan)\n\nImmediate objective is to capture $A_F(6, 2)$ next turn (T36).\n*   T35: Move DOWN to (6, 3).\n*   T36: Move DOWN to (6, 2) (Capture $A_F$).\n\nThe subsequent targets are the Southern apples $A_A(7, 0)$ and $A_B(8, 1)$. After capture at (6, 2), we will need to pivot right towards (7, 2), then right again, or straight down.\n\n*   If we pivot RIGHT to (7, 2) (T37), we are 1 step from $A_A$ and 3 steps from $A_B$.\n*   If we pivot DOWN to (6, 1) (T37), we are 2 steps from $A_A$ and 1 steps from $A_B$.\n\nGiven $A_B(8, 1)$ requires less turning geometry than $A_A(7, 0)$ from (6, 2), the most efficient path is likely RIGHT, then DOWN/RIGHT, targeting $A_B$. We must ensure we do not trap ourselves against our own growing body segments if we move south immediately after T36.\n\nDOWN",

Enemy snake #0's head is at (6,4) with body extending.\n\n**Step 1: Check each direction for immediate death.**\n- **UP** to (1,6): Within board (0\u20139). Cell is empty (`.`). Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n- **DOWN** to (1,4): That's my own body (segment immediately behind head). Moving backwards into own body is fatal. **NOT safe.**\n- **LEFT** to (0,5): Within board. Cell is empty. Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n- **RIGHT** to (2,5): Within board. Cell is empty. Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**\nFrom my head (1,5):\n- **UP** to (1,6): Manhattan distances to apples: (7,0)=12, (8,1)=13, (0,8)=3, (1,8)=2, (6,2)=7. Closest is (1,8) dist 2 after move.\n- **LEFT** to (0,5): Distances: (7,0)=12, (8,1)=14, (0,8)=3, (1,8)=3, (6,2)=9. Closest is (0,8) and (1,8) dist 3 after move.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,5): Distances: (7,0)=10, (8,1)=11, (0,8)=5, (1,8)=4, (6,2)=4. Closest is (6,2) dist 4 after move.\n\nUP gets me closest to the apple cluster at (1,8) and (0,8). RIGHT moves toward (6,2), but that's also near the enemy snake's head at (6,4).\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**\nIf I move **UP** to (1,6):\n- New body: [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0)] (tail (3,1) removed).\n- From (1,6) next turn:\n    - UP to (1,7): Empty. Safe.\n    - DOWN to (1,5): My body (second segment). Not safe.\n    - LEFT to (0,6): Empty. Safe.\n    - RIGHT to (2,6): Empty. Safe.\n- Three safe moves next turn: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Good flexibility.\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (0,5):\n- New body: [(0,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0)] (tail (3,1) removed).\n- From (0,5) next turn:\n    - UP to (0,6): Empty. Safe.\n    - DOWN to (0,4): Empty. Safe.\n    - LEFT: Off board (x=-1). Not safe.\n    - RIGHT to (1,5): My body (second segment). Not safe.\n- Only two safe moves: UP, DOWN. This pins me against the left wall, reducing options.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (2,5):\n- New body: [(2,5), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0)] (tail (3,1) removed).\n- From (2,5) next turn:\n    - UP to (2,6): Empty. Safe.\n    - DOWN to (2,4): Empty. Safe.\n    - LEFT to (1,5): My body (second segment). Not safe.\n    - RIGHT to (3,5): Empty. Safe.\n- Three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Actually three safe moves, not two. However, moving RIGHT takes me toward the center but also toward the enemy snake's head at (6,4) and the apple at (6,2) which the enemy may target.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions.**\nEnemy snake #0 head at (6,4). Manhattan distance from my head: |1-6|+|5-4|=6. No immediate collision risk. However, the enemy is likely to move toward the apple at (6,2) or (8,1). If I move RIGHT, I head toward the enemy's area, increasing risk of future head-on collision or competition for apples. Moving UP keeps me away from the enemy and toward apples (1,8) and (0,8) which are currently uncontested.\n\n**Step 5: Decide and long-term plan.**\nMy last plan was to \"continue moving north toward the apple cluster at (1,8) and (0,8).\" Moving UP advances north and maintains three safe follow-up moves. It avoids the left-wall trap and keeps me central in the vertical column. The apple at (1,8) is only two steps away after this move (from (1,6) to (1,8) is two steps up). The enemy is far and unlikely to reach those apples before me.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Continue moving north toward the apple cluster at (1,8) and (0,8). After UP to (1,6), next turn I can go UP again to (1,7) or move LEFT/RIGHT to adjust. Monitor enemy #0's movement\u2014if it heads toward (6,2), that's fine. Stay flexible and avoid dead-ends. Prioritize eating the apples at (1,8) and (0,8) to gain a lead.\n\nUP",

H1 Prediction and Collision Check (H1 at 1, 6)\n\nH1 is safely at (1, 6) and is clearly targeting the northern apples $A_E(1, 8)$ (2 steps away) or $A_D(0, 8)$ (3 steps away).\n\nPossible moves for H1 (1, 6): UP (1, 7), LEFT (0, 6) or RIGHT (2, 6). DOWN (1, 5) is fatal (neck).\n\n1.  **H1 chooses UP (1, 7):** Advances toward $A_E(1, 8)$, distance 1. Most likely capture this turn.\n2.  **H1 chooses LEFT (0, 6):** Advances toward $A_D(0, 8)$.\n3.  **H1 chooses RIGHT (2, 6):** Moves away from northern apples. Less likely.\n\nIf H0 moves **DOWN** to (6, 2) and H1 moves **UP** to (1, 7), H1 will be at (1, 7). H1 needs one more step (T37) to capture $A_E(1, 8)$.\n\n*If H1 moves to (1, 8) and captures $A_E(1, 8)$ this turn, it is a simultaneous capture.*\nH1 at (1, 6) to (1, 8) is 2 steps, requiring two moves. The distance is 2. H1 can move UP to (1, 7) this turn, and then UP to (1, 8) next turn (T37).\n\nWait, let's re-examine H1's position: (1, 6). $A_E$ is at (1, 8). Manhattan distance is 2. H1 needs 2 steps. Thus, H1 will capture $A_E$ at T38 if it continues UP safely.\n\nGiven H0 is only 1 step away from $A_F$, H0 is guaranteed to capture $A_F$ this turn (T36) safely, unless there's a head-on collision, which is impossible at this distance.\n\nThere are no collision risks. H0 must execute the capture.\n\n---\n### 5. Strategy Note for Future Turns (Plan)\n\nH0 will capture $A_F(6, 2)$ this turn and grow to length 10. H1 is likely moving North toward $A_E$.\n\nFuture Targets for H0 (starting from 6, 2 Head position at T37): $A_A(7, 0)$ and $A_B(8, 1)$.\n\nThe most direct paths from (6, 2) to the Southern apples:\n\n1.  **Target $A_B(8, 1)$:**\n    *   T37: Move RIGHT to (7, 2). (Safe, empty).\n    *   T38: Move RIGHT to (8, 2). (Safe, empty).\n    *   T39: Move DOWN to (8, 1). (Capture $A_B$). (3 steps total)\n\n2.  **Target $A_A(7, 0)$:**\n    *   T37: Move RIGHT to (7, 2). (Safe, empty).\n    *   T38: Move DOWN to (7, 1). (Safe, empty).\n    *   T39: Move DOWN to (7, 0). (Capture $A_A$). (3 steps total)\n\nBoth $A_A$ and $A_B$ are 3 steps away. We should prioritize the one that leaves us in a better position or is less likely to be blocked. Targeting $A_B(8, 1)$ pushes us further East, potentially preparing us for future horizontal moves if more apples spawn there. We will aim for $A_B$.\n\n*   T36: DOWN (Capture $A_F$ at (6, 2)).\n*   T37: RIGHT (Move to (7, 2)).\n*   T38: RIGHT (Move to (8, 2)).\n*   T39: DOWN (Capture $A_B$ at (8, 1)).\n\nA capture is imminent.\n\nDOWN",

Enemy snake #0's head is at (6,3) with body extending.\n\n**Step 1: Check each direction for immediate death.**\n- **UP** to (1,7): Within board (0\u20139). Cell is empty (`.`). Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n- **DOWN** to (1,5): That's my own body (segment immediately behind head). Moving backwards into own body is fatal. **NOT safe.**\n- **LEFT** to (0,6): Within board. Cell is empty. Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n- **RIGHT** to (2,6): Within board. Cell is empty. Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**\nFrom my head (1,6):\n- **UP** to (1,7): Manhattan distances to apples: (7,0)=13, (8,1)=14, (0,8)=1, (1,8)=1, (6,2)=9. Closest are (0,8) and (1,8) dist 1 after move.\n- **LEFT** to (0,6): Distances: (7,0)=13, (8,1)=15, (0,8)=2, (1,8)=2, (6,2)=10. Closest are (0,8) and (1,8) dist 2 after move.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,6): Distances: (7,0)=11, (8,1)=12, (0,8)=4, (1,8)=3, (6,2)=6. Closest is (1,8) dist 3 after move.\n\nUP gets me closest to the apple cluster at (0,8) and (1,8). LEFT also moves toward them but slightly farther.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**\nIf I move **UP** to (1,7):\n- New body: [(1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0)] (tail (3,0) removed).\n- From (1,7) next turn:\n    - UP to (1,8): Apple! Safe (eating apple grows, so tail doesn't move, but space becomes occupied by new head; collision check is before growth, so moving onto apple is safe if cell is not occupied by a body segment).\n    - DOWN to (1,6): My body (second segment). Not safe.\n    - LEFT to (0,7): Empty. Safe.\n    - RIGHT to (2,7): Empty. Safe.\n- Three safe moves next turn: UP (to apple), LEFT, RIGHT. Excellent flexibility and immediate apple access.\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (0,6):\n- New body: [(0,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0)] (tail (3,0) removed).\n- From (0,6) next turn:\n    - UP to (0,7): Empty. Safe.\n    - DOWN to (0,5): Empty. Safe.\n    - LEFT: Off board (x=-1). Not safe.\n    - RIGHT to (1,6): My body (second segment). Not safe.\n- Only two safe moves: UP, DOWN. This pins me against the left wall, reducing options.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (2,6):\n- New body: [(2,6), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0)] (tail (3,0) removed).\n- From (2,6) next turn:\n    - UP to (2,7): Empty. Safe.\n    - DOWN to (2,5): Empty. Safe.\n    - LEFT to (1,6): My body (second segment). Not safe.\n    - RIGHT to (3,6): Empty. Safe.\n- Three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. However, this moves me away from the nearest apples and toward the enemy's area.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions.**\nEnemy snake #0 head at (6,3). Manhattan distance from my head: |1-6|+|6-3|=8. No immediate collision risk. The enemy is likely to move toward the apple at (6,2) or (8,1). If I move UP, I claim the apples at (0,8) and (1,8) quickly, gaining a lead. The enemy is far from those apples (distance |6-0|+|3-8|=11). Moving RIGHT brings me closer to the enemy, increasing future risk.\n\n**Step 5: Decide and long-term plan.**\nMy last plan was to \"continue moving north toward the apple cluster at (1,8) and (0,8).\" Moving UP advances north and puts me one step from both apples. Next turn I can move UP to (1,8) and eat an apple, or if the enemy somehow approaches, I could adjust. This maximizes my apple gain while maintaining flexibility.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Move UP to (1,7). Next turn, eat the apple at (1,8) if still available, or (0,8) if preferable. Monitor enemy #0's movement\u2014it may go for (6,2). Stay in the top-left area to collect apples and avoid head-on collisions. Keep multiple escape routes open.\n\nUP",

Length 10 (9 body segments + head, since last move was a capture).\n    *   Neck: (6, 3).\n    *   Apples collected: 9.\n*   **Enemy Snake 1 (ID 1):**\n    *   Head (H1): (1, 7). Length 9 (8 body segments + head).\n    *   Neck: (1, 6).\n    *   Apples collected: 8.\n*   **Apples at:** $A_A(7, 0)$, $A_B(8, 1)$, $A_C(0, 8)$, $A_D(1, 8)$, $A_E(3, 7)$.\n\n**Scores:** S0 (9) vs S1 (8). I have a 1-point lead.\n\n**Last Move Recap (Turn 36):** H0 moved DOWN from (6, 3) to (6, 2) and captured an apple, increasing length and score. H1 moved UP from (1, 6) to (1, 7). H1 is 1 step away from $A_D(1, 8)$.\n\n---\n### 2. Identifying Immediate Targets and Distances for H0 (6, 2)\n\n| Apple | Position | H0 Manhattan Distance (6, 2) | H1 Manhattan Distance (1, 7) | Notes |\n| :---: | :------: | :--------------------------: | :--------------------------: | :---------------------------------------: |\n| $A_B$ | (8, 1) | 3 | 9 | Secondary target. Closest non-contested apple. |\n| $A_A$ | (7, 0) | 3 | 10 | Secondary target. |\n| $A_D$ | (1, 8) | 7 | 1 | **H1's capture target.** (1 step away) |\n| $A_C$ | (0, 8) | 8 | 2 | H1 is closer. |\n| $A_E$ | (3, 7) | 8 | 4 | H1 is substantially closer. |\n\nH0 needs to aim for $A_A$ or $A_B$. Both are 3 steps away.\n\n---\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (6, 2)\n\nNeck is at (6, 3).\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check (Self/Wall/Enemy Body) | Status | Rationale |\n| :--: | :----------: | :------------------------------------: | :----: | :--------: |\n| UP | (6, 3) | Hits neck cell. | FATAL | Backwards move. |\n| DOWN | (6, 1) | Safe (Empty) | Safe | Takes steps toward (7, 0) and (8, 1). |\n| LEFT | (5, 2) | Safe (Empty) | Safe | Takes steps toward southern wall. Safe path exists. |\n| RIGHT | (7, 2) | Safe (Empty) | Safe | Direct path toward $A_A(7, 0)$ and $A_B(8, 1)$. |\n\nThe optimal direction is RIGHT to (7, 2), as planned last turn, or DOWN to (6, 1) to go under the body faster.\n\n**Path comparison (3 steps total):**\n\n1.  **Target $A_B(8, 1)$:**\n    *   Option 1 (RIGHT path): (6, 2) -> (7, 2) [RIGHT] -> (8, 2) [RIGHT] -> (8, 1) [DOWN].\n    *   Option 2 (DOWN path): (6, 2) -> (6, 1) [DOWN] -> (7, 1) [RIGHT] -> (8, 1) [RIGHT].\n    Both take 3 moves. The RIGHT path seems geometrically simpler and avoids pushing too close to my long tail segments currently occupying (6, 4) to (6, 5).\n\n2.  **Target $A_A(7, 0)$:**\n    *   Option 1 (RIGHT path): (6, 2) -> (7, 2) [RIGHT] -> (7, 1) [DOWN] -> (7, 0) [DOWN].\n\nLet's stick to the plan of moving RIGHT for $A_A$ or $A_B$.\n\n**Move Choice: RIGHT to (7, 2).** This is the first step in the 3-turn plan to intercept a southern apple.\n\n---\n### 4. H1 Prediction and Collision Check (H1 at 1, 7)\n\nH1's neck is at (1, 6). $A_D$ is at (1, 8). H1 is 1 step away from the apple.\n\n*   H1 will almost certainly move **UP** to (1, 8) and capture $A_D$.\n*   This will increase H1's score to 9, tying the score again.\n*   H1's new head position: (1, 8). H1's new length: 10.\n\nIf H0 moves RIGHT to (7, 2) and H1 moves UP to (1, 8), there are no collision risks. The distance between H0 and H1 remains large.\n\n---\n### 5. Strategy Note for Future Turns (Plan)\n\nH0 is at (6, 2) and will move RIGHT to (7, 2). H1 is predicted to capture $A_D(1, 8)$ and move to score 9.\n\nMy immediate focus is $A_A(7, 0)$ or $A_B(8, 1)$. Both require a 3-step sequence starting with RIGHT. I will prioritize $A_A(7, 0)$ as it is closer to the corner, allowing for controlled perimeter movement for the next capture ($A_B(8, 1)$ or whatever spawns).\n\nT37: **RIGHT** (Move to 7, 2).\nT38: DOWN (Move to 7, 1).\nT39: DOWN (Capture $A_A$ at 7, 0). (Targeting $A_A$ at (7, 0))\n\nIf $A_A$ or $A_B$ is captured by H1 unexpectedly (very unlikely due to distance), H0 can pivot towards $A_E(3, 7)$, although H1 is already significantly closer to that eastern cluster of apples.\n\nI need to secure a capture quickly to maintain or re-establish a lead. The path to $A_A(7, 0)$ is clear.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #0's head is at (6,2) with body extending.\n\n**Step 1: Check each direction for immediate death.**\n- **UP** to (1,8): Within board (0\u20139). Cell contains an apple 'A'. Moving onto an apple is safe (collision check is before growth, and the cell is not occupied by a snake body). **Safe.**\n- **DOWN** to (1,6): That's my own body (segment immediately behind head). Moving backwards into own body is fatal. **NOT safe.**\n- **LEFT** to (0,7): Within board. Cell is empty (`.`). Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n- **RIGHT** to (2,7): Within board. Cell is empty. Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**\nFrom my head (1,7):\n- **UP** to (1,8): Apple! Immediate apple consumption, growing to length 10. After eating, my tail stays, so my body will be longer next turn.\n- **LEFT** to (0,7): Manhattan distances to apples: (7,0)=14, (8,1)=15, (0,8)=1, (1,8)=1, (3,7)=3. Closest are (0,8) and (1,8) dist 1 after move.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,7): Distances: (7,0)=12, (8,1)=13, (0,8)=3, (1,8)=2, (3,7)=1. Closest is (3,7) dist 1 after move.\n\nUP gives an immediate apple. LEFT moves toward the apple cluster at top-left. RIGHT moves toward the apple at (3,7).\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**\nIf I move **UP** to (1,8) and eat the apple:\n- New body: head at (1,8), then (1,7), (1,6), ... tail remains (2,0) (since growth adds a segment at tail next turn). Effectively, my body length increases by 1, but the tail cell stays occupied.\n- From (1,8) next turn (after growth):\n    - UP to (1,9): Empty. Safe.\n    - DOWN to (1,7): My body (second segment). Not safe.\n    - LEFT to (0,8): Apple! Safe (if still there).\n    - RIGHT to (2,8): Empty. Safe.\n- Three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Excellent flexibility and another apple nearby.\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (0,7):\n- New body: [(0,7), (1,7), (1,6), ... tail (2,0)].\n- From (0,7) next turn:\n    - UP to (0,8): Apple! Safe.\n    - DOWN to (0,6): Empty. Safe.\n    - LEFT: Off board (x=-1). Not safe.\n    - RIGHT to (1,7): My body (second segment). Not safe.\n- Only two safe moves: UP (to apple), DOWN. This pins me against the left wall.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (2,7):\n- New body: [(2,7), (1,7), (1,6), ... tail (2,0)].\n- From (2,7) next turn:\n    - UP to (2,8): Empty. Safe.\n    - DOWN to (2,6): Empty. Safe.\n    - LEFT to (1,7): My body (second segment). Not safe.\n    - RIGHT to (3,7): Apple! Safe.\n- Three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (to apple). Good flexibility and an apple nearby.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions.**\nEnemy snake #0 head at (6,2). Manhattan distance from my head: |1-6|+|7-2|=10. No immediate collision risk. The enemy is likely to move toward the apple at (3,7) or (8,1). If I move RIGHT toward (3,7), I risk getting closer to the enemy's possible path. Moving UP to eat (1,8) secures an apple and keeps me in the top-left, away from the enemy. The enemy is far from (1,8) (distance |6-1|+|2-8|=11). Moving LEFT also keeps me away but reduces options.\n\n**Step 5: Decide and long-term plan.**\nMy last plan was to move UP to (1,7) and then eat the apple at (1,8). I am now at (1,7), so executing that plan: move UP to (1,8) and eat the apple. This increases my apple count to 9, tying snake #0. It also maintains flexibility for next turn, where I can go for (0,8) or explore further. Avoiding the left wall trap is wise, and moving RIGHT brings me closer to the enemy. UP is the clear best move.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** After eating the apple at (1,8), assess the board. Likely move LEFT to (0,8) to eat the next apple if still available, or UP to (1,9) to explore. Monitor enemy #0's movement\u2014it may go for (3,7) or (8,1). Stay in the top-left area to collect apples and avoid head-on collisions. Keep multiple escape routes open.\n\nUP",

(Note: $A_D$ and $A_E$ names seem offset from previous turn, let's use current coordinates for consistency).\n\n**Scores:** S0 (9) vs S1 (9). Tied.\n\n**Last Move Recap (Turn 37):**\n*   H0 moved RIGHT from (6, 2) to (7, 2). My turn 37 rationale anticipated H1 moving UP to (1, 8) and capturing an apple, which appears correct given H1's current position (1, 8) and score (9).\n*   H0 is now 2 steps away from $A_B(8, 1)$.\n*   H0 is 2 steps away from $A_A(7, 0)$.\n\n---\n### 2. Identifying Immediate Targets and Distances for H0 (7, 2)\n\n| Apple | Position | H0 Manhattan Distance (7, 2) | H1 Manhattan Distance (1, 8) | Notes |\n| :---: | :------: | :--------------------------: | :--------------------------: | :---------------------------------------: |\n| $A_A$ | (7, 0) | 2 | 8 | Primary target. |\n| $A_B$ | (8, 1) | 2 | 8 | Primary target. |\n| $A_C$ | (0, 8) | 7 | 1 | **H1's capture target.** (1 step away) |\n| $A_D$ | (3, 7) | 5 | 5 | Contested, but H1 will likely capture $A_C$ first. |\n| $A_E$ | (3, 6) | 6 | 4 | H1 is slightly closer. |\n\nH1 is one step away from $A_C(0, 8)$. H1 will almost certainly move LEFT and capture it, taking the lead. My move priority must remain securing $A_A$ or $A_B$.\n\nThe plan from the last turn was:\nT37: RIGHT (Complete, H0 is at 7, 2)\nT38: DOWN (Move to 7, 1) - Targeting $A_A(7, 0)$\nT39: DOWN (Capture $A_A$ at 7, 0)\n\nThis plan relies on going through (7, 1) to get to (7, 0).\n\n---\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (7, 2)\n\nNeck is at (6, 2).\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check (Self/Wall/Enemy Body) | Status | Rationale |\n| :--: | :----------: | :------------------------------------: | :----: | :--------: |\n| UP | (7, 3) | Safe (Empty) | Safe | Deviates from plan. Moves back towards own body segments (8, 5) / (7, 5). |\n| DOWN | (7, 1) | Safe (Empty) | Safe | **On course for $A_A$ or $A_B$.** |\n| LEFT | (6, 2) | Hits neck cell (6, 2). | FATAL | Backwards move. |\n| RIGHT | (8, 2) | Safe (Empty) | Safe | Direct path choice for $A_B(8, 1)$. |\n\nBoth DOWN to (7, 1) and RIGHT to (8, 2) are good moves toward apples.\n\n1.  **If DOWN to (7, 1):** Next turn, I can move DOWN to capture $A_A(7, 0)$ or RIGHT to move towards $A_B(8, 1)$. This maintains flexibility.\n    *   Path to $A_A(7, 0)$: (7, 2) -> (7, 1) [DOWN] -> (7, 0) [DOWN]. (2 moves remaining to capture)\n    *   Path to $A_B(8, 1)$: (7, 2) -> (7, 1) [DOWN] -> (8, 1) [RIGHT]. (2 moves remaining to capture)\n\n2.  **If RIGHT to (8, 2):** Next turn, I can move DOWN to capture $A_B(8, 1)$.\n    *   Path to $A_B(8, 1)$: (7, 2) -> (8, 2) [RIGHT] -> (8, 1) [DOWN]. (2 moves remaining to capture)\n\nBoth starting moves achieve a capture in 2 more turns. Moving to (7, 1) minimizes movement along the x-axis, keeping H0 closer to the current line of movement. Moving DOWN is good to secure a low y-coordinate apple. I will prioritize the planned move (DOWN).\n\n---\n### 4. H1 Prediction and Collision Check (H1 at 1, 8)\n\nH1's neck is at (1, 7). $A_C$ is at (0, 8). H1 is 1 step away from the apple.\n\n*   H1 will almost certainly move **LEFT** to (0, 8) and capture $A_C$.\n*   This increases H1's score to 10, taking a temporary lead.\n*   H1's new head position: (0, 8).\n\nIf H0 moves DOWN to (7, 1) and H1 moves LEFT to (0, 8), there are no collision risks.\n\n---\n### 5. Strategy Note for Future Turns (Plan)\n\nH0 moves DOWN to (7, 1). H1 is presumed to capture $A_C(0, 8)$.\n\nMy immediate focus is $A_A(7, 0)$ or $A_B(8, 1)$. Since both are 2 steps away starting from (7, 1) (if moving DOWN) or (8, 2) (if moving RIGHT), I must choose one to focus on.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 1):\nT38: **DOWN** (Move to 7, 1).\nT39: DOWN (Capture $A_A$ at 7, 0). Score 10.\nT40: Target $A_B(8, 1)$ or next available target.\n\nIf I secure $A_A$ at T39, the scores will be tied again at 10 (assuming H1 captured $A_C$). H0's tail will trail off at (6, 3), keeping my main body safely tucked in while H1 is busy on the left perimeter.\n\nDOWN",

My body is now: head (1,8), then (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0) \u2014 length 10. The apple at (1,8) is gone.\n\n**Step 1: Check each direction for immediate death.**\n- **UP** to (1,9): Within board (0\u20139). Cell is empty (`.`). Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n- **DOWN** to (1,7): That's my own body (second segment). Moving backwards into own body is fatal. **NOT safe.**\n- **LEFT** to (0,8): Within board. Cell contains an apple 'A'. Moving onto an apple is safe (cell not occupied by a snake body). **Safe.**\n- **RIGHT** to (2,8): Within board. Cell is empty (`.`). Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**\nFrom my head (1,8):\n- **UP** to (1,9): No apple. Manhattan distances to remaining apples: (7,0)=15, (8,1)=15, (0,8)=1, (3,7)=4, (3,6)=5. Closest is (0,8) distance 1 after move (but I'd be moving away from it).\n- **LEFT** to (0,8): Apple! Immediate consumption, growing to length 11.\n- **RIGHT** to (2,8): No apple. Distances: (7,0)=13, (8,1)=13, (0,8)=2, (3,7)=2, (3,6)=3. Closest are (0,8) and (3,7) distance 2 after move.\n\nLEFT gives an immediate apple. UP moves toward the top edge but away from most apples. RIGHT moves toward the center and closer to (3,7).\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**\nIf I move **LEFT** to (0,8) and eat the apple:\n- New body: head at (0,8), then (1,8), (1,7), ... tail remains (2,0) after growth.\n- From (0,8) next turn:\n    - UP to (0,9): Empty. Safe.\n    - DOWN to (0,7): Empty. Safe.\n    - LEFT: Off board (x=-1). Not safe.\n    - RIGHT to (1,8): My body (second segment). Not safe.\n- Only two safe moves: UP, DOWN. This pins me against the left wall, reducing options.\n\nIf I move **UP** to (1,9):\n- New body: head at (1,9), then (1,8), (1,7), ... tail (2,0).\n- From (1,9) next turn:\n    - UP: Off board (y=10). Not safe.\n    - DOWN to (1,8): My body (second segment). Not safe.\n    - LEFT to (0,9): Empty. Safe.\n    - RIGHT to (2,9): Empty. Safe.\n- Two safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT. Better than being pinned against left wall? Still limited.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (2,8):\n- New body: head at (2,8), then (1,8), (1,7), ... tail (2,0).\n- From (2,8) next turn:\n    - UP to (2,9): Empty. Safe.\n    - DOWN to (2,7): Empty. Safe.\n    - LEFT to (1,8): My body (second segment). Not safe.\n    - RIGHT to (3,8): Empty. Safe.\n- Three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Good flexibility.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions.**\nEnemy snake #0 head at (7,2). Manhattan distance from my head: |1-7|+|8-2|=12. No immediate collision risk. The enemy is likely to move toward apples at (3,7) or (8,1). Moving RIGHT toward (2,8) brings me closer to (3,7), which might attract the enemy. Moving LEFT to (0,8) secures an apple and keeps me in the top-left, away from the enemy. However, being pinned against the left wall is risky long-term. Moving UP to (1,9) also keeps me away but offers limited options.\n\n**Step 5: Decide and long-term plan.**\nMy primary goal is to stay alive and collect apples. While LEFT gives an immediate apple, it traps me against the left wall with only two moves next turn, which could be dangerous if the enemy approaches. RIGHT offers more flexibility and keeps me moving toward the apple cluster at (3,7) and (3,6), but I must be cautious of enemy #0. UP is less desirable as it moves away from apples.\n\nGiven the tie in apple count, I need to maintain mobility. I'll choose RIGHT to keep options open and move toward the center where more apples are, while monitoring the enemy's movement.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** After moving RIGHT to (2,8), assess the board. Consider moving DOWN to (2,7) or RIGHT to (3,8) to approach the apples at (3,7) and (3,6). Watch enemy #0's head\u2014if it moves toward (3,7), I may need to avoid a head-on collision. Stay flexible and avoid dead-ends.\n\nRIGHT",

(Note: The body listed in the prompt is 9 segments long; with the head at (7,1), total length is 10. The score increased from 9 to 9, which means my *last* move (T38) must have been a capture if the length increased. Given the score is *still* 9, and the body list is 9 segments long, the snake is length 10. The prompt states my score is 9, and the head moved from (7, 2) to (7, 1). This implies the T38 move (DOWN) was **not** a capture, and the body segments shifted: (7, 2) became the neck, and the tail (9, 6) should have contracted off. Let's assume current length is 10, tail is (9, 6), and the move was non-capture.)\n    *   Apples collected: 9.\n*   **Enemy Snake 1 (ID 1):**\n    *   Head (H1): (2, 8).

Identifying Immediate Targets and Distances for H0 (7, 1)\n\n| Apple | Position | H0 Manhattan Distance (7, 1) | H1 Manhattan Distance (2, 8) | Notes |\n| :---: | :------: | :--------------------------: | :--------------------------: | :----------------------------------: |\n| $A_A$ | (7, 0) | 1 | 9 | **Primary Target.** Direct capture possible. |\n| $A_B$ | (8, 1) | 1 | 9 | Secondary Target.

Both are 1 step away.\n\nH1 (2, 8) is 1 step away from $A_D(3, 7)$. H1 will likely move RIGHT to capture $A_D$.\n\n**If H1 captures $A_D$, H1 will take the lead (10-9). It is critical that H0 captures an apple this turn to maintain the tie.**\n\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (7, 1)\n\nNeck is at (7, 2).\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check (Self/Wall/Enemy Body) | Capture? | Rationale |\n| :--: | :----------: | :------------------------------------: | :------: | :--------: |\n| UP | (7, 2) | Hits neck cell (7, 2). | FATAL | Backwards move. |\n| DOWN | (7, 0) | Safe (Apple $A_A$) | CAPTURE | Captures $A_A$. Score 10. |\n| LEFT | (6, 1) | Safe (Empty) | No | Moves away from both immediate apples. |\n| RIGHT | (8, 1) | Safe (Apple $A_B$) | CAPTURE | Captures $A_B$. Score 10. |\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT are safe, legal moves that result in an apple capture, bringing the score to 10 and re-tying the game (assuming H1 captures $A_D$).\n\n**Choosing between DOWN to (7, 0) and RIGHT to (8, 1):**\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (7, 0):** Places H0 in the bottom-left corner of the local apple cluster. The whole lower boundary (x=0 to x=9, y=0) is now open for movement.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (8, 1):** Places H0 near the bottom-right corner.\n\nBoth are equally good strategically. Since my previous *plan* aimed for $A_A(7, 0)$ via the DOWN sequence, I will stick to that plan.\n\n**Predicted H1 Move:** H1 (2, 8) moving RIGHT to (3, 8). This move brings H1 closer to $A_D(3, 7)$. Wait, H1's current head is (2, 8). $A_D$ is at (3, 7). To capture $A_D$ in one move, H1 must move diagonally, which is not allowed.\n\nLet's re-evaluate H1's shortest path to apples:\n*   $A_D(3, 7)$: 1 step RIGHT to (3, 8), then 1 step DOWN to (3, 7). (2 moves)\n*   $A_C(0, 8)$: 2 steps (LEFT to (1, 8) - wait, H1's neck is (1, 8), so H1 cannot move LEFT to (1, 8) without hitting neck)\n*   H1 Head (2, 8). Neck (1, 8).\n    *   H1 UP to (2, 9) - Safe, moves away from apples.\n    *   H1 DOWN to (2, 7) - Moves towards $A_D, A_E$.\n    *   H1 LEFT to (1, 8) - FATAL (Hits neck).\n    *   H1 RIGHT to (3, 8) - Moves towards $A_D$.\n\nH1 is most likely moving **RIGHT** to (3, 8), setting up for $A_D$ or $A_E$ next turn, or **DOWN** to (2, 7). In either case, H1 cannot capture an apple this turn.\n\n**Conclusion:** H0 has a guaranteed capture this turn (DOWN to $A_A$ or RIGHT to $A_B$) while H1 cannot capture an apple. H0 will take the lead (10-9).\n\nI choose DOWN.\n\n### 4. Strategy Note for Future Turns (Plan)\n\nT39: **DOWN** to (7, 0) (Capture $A_A$. Score 10, Lead 1).\nT40: H0 needs a new target. The closest apple is now $A_B(8, 1)$ (2 steps away). H0 will move RIGHT to (8, 0).\nT41: UP to (8, 1) (Capture $A_B$. Score 11, Lead 2).\n\nThis sequence secures two immediate apples and positions H0 safely in the corner. H1 will be congested on the left side, likely trying to secure $A_D$ or $A_E$.\n\nDOWN",

My body is now: head (2,8), then (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) \u2014 length 10. My apple count is 9, tied with snake #0.\n\n**Step 1: Check each direction for immediate death.**\n- **UP** to (2,9): Within board (0\u20139). Cell is empty (`.`). Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n- **DOWN** to (2,7): Within board. Cell is empty (`.`). Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n- **LEFT** to (1,8): That's my own body (second segment). Moving backwards into own body is fatal. **NOT safe.**\n- **RIGHT** to (3,8): Within board. Cell is empty (`.`). Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**\nFrom my head (2,8):\n- **UP** to (2,9): No apple. Manhattan distances to apples: (7,0)=14, (8,1)=14, (0,8)=2, (3,7)=3, (3,6)=4. Closest is (0,8) distance 2 after move.\n- **DOWN** to (2,7): No apple. Distances: (7,0)=12, (8,1)=12, (0,8)=3, (3,7)=1, (3,6)=2. Closest is (3,7) distance 1 after move.\n- **RIGHT** to (3,8): No apple. Distances: (7,0)=12, (8,1)=12, (0,8)=3, (3,7)=2, (3,6)=3. Closest are (3,7) distance 2, (0,8) distance 3.\n\nDOWN gets me closest to the apple cluster at (3,7) and (3,6). RIGHT also moves me toward them but is slightly farther.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**\nIf I move **DOWN** to (2,7):\n- New body: head at (2,7), then (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), ... tail (2,1).\n- From (2,7) next turn:\n    - UP to (2,8): My body (second segment). Not safe.\n    - DOWN to (2,6): Empty. Safe.\n    - LEFT to (1,7): My body (fourth segment). Not safe.\n    - RIGHT to (3,7): Apple! Moving onto an apple is safe (cell not occupied by a snake body).\n- Two safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT. RIGHT leads directly to an apple.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (3,8):\n- New body: head at (3,8), then (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), ... tail (2,1).\n- From (3,8) next turn:\n    - UP to (3,9): Empty. Safe.\n    - DOWN to (3,7): Apple! Safe.\n    - LEFT to (2,8): My body (second segment). Not safe.\n    - RIGHT to (4,8): Empty. Safe.\n- Three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. DOWN leads to an apple.\n\nIf I move **UP** to (2,9):\n- New body: head at (2,9), then (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), ... tail (2,1).\n- From (2,9) next turn:\n    - UP: Off board (y=10). Not safe.\n    - DOWN to (2,8): My body (second segment). Not safe.\n    - LEFT to (1,9): Empty. Safe.\n    - RIGHT to (3,9): Empty. Safe.\n- Two safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT. Moves me away from apples and into a corner.\n\nDOWN and RIGHT both lead to positions with good future access to apples. UP is less desirable.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions.**\nEnemy snake #0 head at (7,1). Manhattan distance from my head: |2-7|+|8-1|=12. No immediate collision risk. The enemy is likely to move toward apples at (8,1) or (7,0), or possibly (3,7). The apple at (3,7) is closer to me. Moving DOWN to (2,7) puts me one step away from (3,7). The enemy is 6 steps away (|7-3|+|1-7|=8? Wait recalc: |7-3|=4, |1-7|=6, sum=10). Actually enemy is at (7,1), apple at (3,7): |7-3|=4, |1-7|=6, total 10 steps. I'd be 1 step away. I could potentially reach it next turn if the enemy doesn't block. However, simultaneous moves mean we could both head for it. A head-on collision at (3,7) is possible if we both move there. But if I move DOWN to (2,7), I can move RIGHT to (3,7) next turn. The enemy could move LEFT to (6,1), then UP repeatedly? Its path isn't direct. It's safer to secure the apple quickly.\n\n**Step 5: Decide and long-term plan.**\nMy primary goal is to collect apples while staying alive. DOWN puts me in a strong position to take (3,7) next turn, and also keeps the apple at (3,6) nearby. RIGHT also gives good options but is slightly farther. I'll choose DOWN to get closer to the apples and maintain flexibility (I can go DOWN to (2,6) or RIGHT to (3,7) next turn).\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** After moving DOWN to (2,7), assess the board. If (3,7) is still available and no enemy is adjacent, consider moving RIGHT to eat it. Otherwise, move DOWN to (2,6) to approach (3,6) or evade. Monitor enemy #0's head\u2014if it moves toward (3,7), I may need to avoid a head-on collision. Stay flexible and avoid dead-ends.\n\nDOWN",

This means H1 must have moved DOWN in T39, or the body list in the prompt is slightly inaccurate regarding the head-to-neck connection. Given the board visualization (T is at 2, 7 and 2, 8), H1's head is shown at (2, 7) and the neck at (2, 8). This means H1's last movement direction was DOWN.\n*   **Apples at:** $A_B(8, 1)$, $A_C(0, 8)$, $A_D(3, 7)$, $A_E(3, 6)$, $A_F(1, 0)$.\n    *   Note: The apple (7, 0) was eaten by S0 in T39.

Identifying Immediate Targets and Distances\n\n| Apple | Position | H0 Manhattan Distance (7, 0) | H1 Manhattan Distance (2, 7) | Notes |\n| :---: | :------: | :--------------------------: | :--------------------------: | :----------------------------------: |\n| $A_B$ | (8, 1) | 2 (1 Right, 1 Up) | 8 | **Primary Target for H0.** 2 steps away. |\n| $A_D$ | (3, 7) | 11 | 4 | Contested, but H1 is much closer. |\n| $A_E$ | (3, 6) | 10 | 1 | **Primary Target for H1.** 1 step DOWN. |\n| $A_C$ | (0, 8) | 15 | 3 | Far for both, H1 is closer. |\n| $A_F$ | (1, 0) | 6 | 8 | Far for both, H0 potentially closer in a few turns if moving along bottom wall. |\n\n**Current Lead:** S0 leads 10 to 9. H1 will almost certainly capture $A_E(3, 6)$ this turn, tying the score at 10-10. My plan must secure $A_B(8, 1)$.\n\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (7, 0)\n\nNeck is at (7, 1).\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check (Self/Wall/Enemy Body) | Capture? | Rationale |\n| :--: | :----------: | :------------------------------------: | :------: | :--------: |\n| UP | (7, 1) | Hits neck cell (7, 1). | FATAL | Backwards move. |\n| DOWN | (7, -1) | Hits Wall (Y < 0). | FATAL | Out of bounds. |\n| LEFT | (6, 0) | Safe (Empty) | No | Sets up for $A_F(1, 0)$ but moves away from immediate apple $A_B(8, 1)$. |\n| RIGHT | (8, 0) | Safe (Empty) | No | **Sets up for $A_B(8, 1)$.** Optimal move. |\n\nThe only rational move is **RIGHT** to (8, 0). This move positions H0 1 step away from $A_B(8, 1)$, ensuring a capture next turn (T41).\n\n### 4. Enemy Prediction (H1 at 2, 7)\n\nNeck is at (2, 8).\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check (Self/Wall/Enemy Body) | Capture? | Rationale |\n| :--: | :----------: | :------------------------------------: | :------: | :--------: |\n| UP | (2, 8) | Hits neck cell (2, 8). | FATAL | Backwards move. |\n| DOWN | (2, 6) | Safe (Empty) | No | Moves towards $A_E(3, 6)$. |\n| LEFT | (1, 7) | Safe (Body segment) | FATAL? | H1 body segment is at (1, 7). H1 moves into its own body segment: Death. |\n| RIGHT | (3, 7) | Safe (Apple $A_D$) | CAPTURE | Captures $A_D$. Score 10. |\n\nWait, let's re-examine H1's body and the board status.\nH1 Body: `[(2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2)]`.\nH1 Head: (2, 7).\n\n*   If H1 moves **DOWN** to (2, 6): Safe. Path to $A_E(3, 6)$.\n*   If H1 moves **RIGHT** to (3, 7): Captures $A_D(3, 7)$. Score 10.\n\nH1 has two excellent capture options:\n1. Move RIGHT to $A_D(3, 7)$. (Immediate capture, score 10).\n2. Move DOWN to (2, 6), then RIGHT to $A_E(3, 6)$. (2 turns for capture).\n\nH1 will likely choose **RIGHT** to capture $A_D(3, 7)$ immediately, tying the game at 10-10.\n\nIf H1 attempts to move LEFT to (1, 7), it hits its own body segment (1, 7) and dies.\n\n### 5. Conclusion and Strategy\n\nMy move RIGHT to (8, 0) is safe and sets up a guaranteed capture of $A_B(8, 1)$ next turn. This is the optimal local move, regardless of H1's action. If H1 succeeds in capturing $A_D$, the game is tied, and I am guaranteed to take the lead next turn.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T41/T42)**\nT40: **RIGHT** to (8, 0). (Sets up $A_B$).\nT41: UP to (8, 1). (Capture $A_B$. Score 11. Lead 1).\nT42: Retreat from corner. Target $A_F(1, 0)$.\n\nRIGHT",

There are five apples on the board: (8,1), (0,8), (3,7), (3,6), (1,0).\n\n**Step 1: Check each direction for immediate death.**\n- **UP** to (2,8): That's my own body (second segment).

Very close to (3,6).\n\nRIGHT directly collects an apple, which is highly desirable to catch up in score.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (3,7) and eat the apple:\n- New body: head at (3,7), then (2,7), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) \u2014 length 12 (since I grow, tail stays at (2,1)).\n- From (3,7) next turn:\n    - UP to (3,8): Empty.

DOWN leads directly to another apple.\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (2,6):\n- New body: head at (2,6), then (2,7), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), ... tail (2,1).\n- From (2,6) next turn:\n    - UP to (2,7): My body (second segment). Not safe.\n    - DOWN to (2,5): Empty. Safe.\n    - LEFT to (1,6): My body (fifth segment). Not safe.\n    - RIGHT to (3,6): Apple! Safe.\n- Two safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT. RIGHT leads to an apple.\n\nBoth moves lead to positions with an apple adjacent next turn. However, moving RIGHT eats an apple *now*, which is better for immediate score gain and growth.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions.**\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (7,0). Manhattan distance to (3,7) is |7-3|+|0-7|=4+7=11 steps. To (3,6) is |7-3|+|0-6|=4+6=10 steps. The enemy is far away and likely to move toward apples (8,1) or (1,0) which are closer to it. A head-on collision at (3,7) this turn is impossible because the enemy cannot reach it in one move. However, simultaneous moves mean we could both target the same apple next turn. If I eat (3,7) now, I can potentially eat (3,6) next turn before the enemy gets close.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan.**\nMy goal is to catch up in apples. The cluster at (3,7) and (3,6) is ripe for picking. I should eat (3,7) now, then (3,6) next turn if possible. That would give me 11 apples, surpassing the enemy's current 10. After that, I can consider moving toward (0,8) or (1,0), while avoiding getting trapped. I must monitor enemy #0's movement\u2014it may head toward (8,1) or (1,0). My increased length will give me more presence on the board.\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT is the best move\u2014it immediately collects an apple, ties the score, and positions me to collect another apple next turn.\n\nRIGHT",

Identifying Immediate Targets and Distances\n\n| Apple | Position | H0 Manhattan Distance (8, 0) | H1 Manhattan Distance (3, 7) | Notes |\n| :---: | :------: | :--------------------------: | :--------------------------: | :----------------------------------: |\n| $A_B$ | (8, 1) | 1 (1 Up) | 7 | **Primary Target for H0.** Immediate capture. |\n| $A_C$ | (0, 8) | 9 | 4 | H1 is closer. |\n| $A_E$ | (3, 6) | 5 | 1 (1 Down) | **Primary Target for H1.** Immediate capture. |\n| $A_F$ | (1, 0) | 7 | 10 | Far for both. |\n| $A_G$ | (3, 1) | 6 | 6 | Equally distant. |\n\nBoth snakes are positioned for immediate capture, maintaining the tie.\n\n*   H0 targets $A_B(8, 1)$.\n*   H1 targets $A_E(3, 6)$.\n\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (8, 0)\n\nNeck is at (7, 0).\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check (Self/Wall/Enemy Body) | Capture? | Rationale |\n| :--: | :----------: | :------------------------------------: | :------: | :--------: |\n| UP | (8, 1) | Safe (Apple) | CAPTURE | **Guaranteed score.** Gives S0 the lead 11-10. |\n| DOWN | (8, -1) | Hits Wall. | FATAL | Out of bounds. |\n| LEFT | (7, 0) | Hits neck cell (7, 0). | FATAL | Backwards move. |\n| RIGHT | (9, 0) | Safe (Empty) | No | Retreat from the corner, but delays capture. |\n\nThe move **UP** to (8, 1) secures the apple, giving me the lead. This is the optimal move.\n\n### 4. Enemy Prediction (H1 at 3, 7)\n\nNeck is at (2, 7). H1's primary target is $A_E(3, 6)$.\n\n| Move | New Position | Collision Check (Self/Wall/Enemy Body) | Capture? | Rationale |\n| :--: | :----------: | :------------------------------------: | :------: | :--------: |\n| UP | (3, 8) | Safe (Empty) | No | Moves away from apple $A_E(3, 6)$. |\n| DOWN | (3, 6) | Safe (Apple $A_E$) | CAPTURE | **Likely move.** Captures $A_E$. Score 11. |\n| LEFT | (2, 7) | Hits neck cell (2, 7). | FATAL | Backwards move. |\n| RIGHT | (4, 7) | Safe (Empty) | No | Moves away from $A_E(3, 6)$. |\n\nH1 will overwhelmingly likely move **DOWN** to capture $A_E(3, 6)$.\n\n### 5. Collision Check (Head-to-Head)\n\n*   My move: UP to (8, 1).\n*   Enemy move: DOWN to (3, 6).\n*   The target cells (8, 1) and (3, 6) are far apart. No head-on collision is risked.\n\n### 6. Conclusion and Strategy\n\nThe best move is **UP** to capture $A_B(8, 1)$. This guarantees a secure point and puts me in the lead, regardless of H1's predictable capture of $A_E(3, 6)$.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T42/T43)**\nT41 (Current): **UP** to (8, 1). (Capture $A_B$. Score 11. Lead 1). H0 neck moves from (8, 0) to (7, 0). Tail at (8, 6) is removed if we don't grow. Since we capture, the tail remains, and H0 is now at (8, 1).\nT42: Retreat from corner (8, 1). Options: DOWN to (8, 0), RIGHT to (9, 1). If moving DOWN, we must avoid hitting our new neck (8, 0). Wait, since we grow, the neck remains at (8, 0). Moving DOWN hits the neck.\nSafe moves from (8, 1): RIGHT (9, 1), LEFT (7, 1), UP (8, 2).\nTarget: $A_C(0, 8)$, $A_F(1, 0)$, or $A_G(3, 1)$. $A_G(3, 1)$ or $A_F(1, 0)$ looks better than challenging H1 for $A_C(0, 8)$. We should aim RIGHT to (9, 1) and then start moving along the top or bottom edges to the center-left.\n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current board, my head is at (3,7). I just ate the apple at (3,7) last turn, so my length has grown by one. My body now runs from (3,7) head, then (2,7), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) \u2014 that's 12 segments. The tail is at (2,1). Apples are at (8,1), (0,8), (3,6), (1,0), (3,1). Wait, the board shows apple at (3,6) and (3,1)? The listed apples are (8,1), (0,8), (3,6), (1,0), (3,1). But the board shows 'A' at (3,6) and also at (3,1)? Let's check: board row 6 column 3 is (3,6) \u2014 yes 'A'. Row 1 column 3 is (3,1) \u2014 that's '.' actually. The board shows (3,1) as '.'? Let's re-examine: The board row 1: \". . . A . . . T A .\" That's positions 0-9: (0,1)='.', (1,1)='.', (2,1)='.', (3,1)='A', (4,1)='.', (5,1)='.', (6,1)='.', (7,1)='T', (8,1)='A', (9,1)='.'. So (3,1) is indeed an apple 'A'. Good. So apples: (8,1), (0,8), (3,6), (1,0), (3,1).\n\n**Step 1: Check each direction for immediate death.**\n\n- **UP** to (3,8): Within board. Cell is empty (`.`). Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n- **DOWN** to (3,6): Contains an apple (`A`). Moving onto an apple is safe (cell not occupied by a snake body). **Safe.**\n- **LEFT** to (2,7): That's my own body (second segment). Moving into my own body is fatal. **NOT safe.**\n- **RIGHT** to (4,7): Within board. Cell is empty (`.`). Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**\n\nFrom my head (3,7):\n- **UP** to (3,8): No apple. Manhattan distances to apples after move: (8,1)=|3-8|+|8-1|=5+7=12, (0,8)=|3-0|+|8-8|=3+0=3, (3,6)=|3-3|+|8-6|=0+2=2, (1,0)=|3-1|+|8-0|=2+8=10, (3,1)=|3-3|+|8-1|=0+7=7. Closest is (0,8) distance 3, then (3,6) distance 2 but that's behind me.\n- **DOWN** to (3,6): Apple! Eating it gives me +1 apple (making me 11 apples vs enemy 10) and grows my length by 1. Distances to other apples after eating: (8,1)=|3-8|+|6-1|=5+5=10, (0,8)=|3-0|+|6-8|=3+2=5, (1,0)=|3-1|+|6-0|=2+6=8, (3,1)=|3-3|+|6-1|=0+5=5.\n- **RIGHT** to (4,7): No apple. Distances to apples: (8,1)=|4-8|+|7-1|=4+6=10, (0,8)=|4-0|+|7-8|=4+1=5, (3,6)=|4-3|+|7-6|=1+1=2, (1,0)=|4-1|+|7-0|=3+7=10, (3,1)=|4-3|+|7-1|=1+6=7. Closest is (3,6) distance 2, but that's back left.\n\nDOWN directly collects an apple, which is highly desirable to increase my lead.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (3,6) and eat the apple:\n- New body: head at (3,6), then (3,7), (2,7), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1) \u2014 length 13.\n- From (3,6) next turn:\n    - UP to (3,7): My body (second segment). Not safe.\n    - DOWN to (3,5): Empty. Safe.\n    - LEFT to (2,6): Empty? Board shows (2,6) is '.' (row 6 col 2). Safe.\n    - RIGHT to (4,6): Empty. Safe.\n- Three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Good options.\n\nIf I move **UP** to (3,8):\n- New body: head at (3,8), then (3,7), (2,7), (2,8), (1,8), (1,7), ... tail (2,1).\n- From (3,8) next turn:\n    - UP to (3,9): Empty. Safe.\n    - DOWN to (3,7): My body (second segment). Not safe.\n    - LEFT to (2,8): My body (fourth segment? Actually (2,8) is third segment). Not safe.\n    - RIGHT to (4,8): Empty. Safe.\n- Two safe moves: UP, RIGHT. Limited.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (4,7):\n- New body: head at (4,7), then (3,7), (2,7), (2,8), (1,8), ... tail (2,1).\n- From (4,7) next turn:\n    - UP to (4,8): Empty. Safe.\n    - DOWN to (4,6): Empty. Safe.\n    - LEFT to (3,7): My body (second segment). Not safe.\n    - RIGHT to (5,7): Empty. Safe.\n- Three safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. Good.\n\nDOWN gives immediate apple and good future options.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions.**\n\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (8,0). Manhattan distance to (3,6) is |8-3|+|0-6|=5+6=11 steps. To (3,7) is 5+7=12. The enemy is far away. It might move toward apples (8,1) or (1,0). There's no risk of head-on collision this turn because enemy cannot reach my target cells in one move. However, simultaneous moves mean we could both target the same apple next turn. If I eat (3,6) now, I remove that apple and grow, making it harder for enemy to catch up.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan.**\n\nMy goal is to increase my apple lead. The apple at (3,6) is adjacent and ripe. I should eat it now. After that, I can consider moving toward (0,8) or (3,1) while avoiding getting trapped. I must monitor enemy #0's movement\u2014it may head toward (8,1) or (1,0). My increased length will give me more board control.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN is the best move\u2014it immediately collects an apple, increases my lead to 11 apples, and leaves me with multiple safe moves next turn.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After eating (3,6), assess moves toward (0,8) or (3,1). Avoid moving into confined spaces. Keep an eye on enemy #0's path; it may be heading toward (8,1) which is close to its head. I can consider moving left toward (0,8) after securing nearby apples.\n\nDOWN",

H1 is at (3, 6).\n\n### 2. Identifying Immediate Targets and Distances\n\nH0 (8, 1). Neck is (8, 0).\nH1 (3, 6). Neck is (3, 7).\n\n| Apple | Position | H0 Manhattan Distance (8, 1) | H1 Manhattan Distance (3, 6) | Notes |\n| :---: | :------: | :--------------------------: | :--------------------------: | :----------------------------------: |\n| A | (0, 8) | 7 + 7 = 14 | 0 + 2 = 2 | **H1's Primary Target.** |\n| B | (1, 0) | 7 + 1 = 8 | 2 + 6 = 8 | Far, but potential. |\n| C | (3, 1) | 5 + 0 = 5 | 0 + 5 = 5 | Both 5 steps away. |\n| D | (3, 0) | 5 + 1 = 6 | 0 + 6 = 6 | Both 6 steps away. |\n| E | (6, 0) | 2 + 1 = 3 | 3 + 6 = 9 | **H0's Nearest Target (3 steps).** |\n\nH0's nearest apple is $E(6, 0)$ (3 steps).\nH1's nearest apple is $A(0, 8)$ (2 steps).\n\n### 3. Candidate Moves for S0 (8, 1)\n\nMy current direction of travel was UP. Neck is at (8, 0).\n\n1.  **UP (8, 2):** Safe. Moves toward center/top edge. Distance to E is 4.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 0):** **FATAL.** Moves into neck cell (8, 0). (Since we grew, the segment at (8, 0) is still part of the body).\n3.  **LEFT (7, 1):** Safe. Moves toward the body segment (7, 1), but this is not the neck, so it's a valid move. Distance to E is 3. This puts us next to the vertical body segment (7, 0)-(7, 2).\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 1):** Safe. Moves toward the wall, reducing options, but keeps H0 on the edge. Distance to E is 4.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe immediate goal is $E(6, 0)$.\n*   Moving LEFT (7, 1) sets up for moving LEFT to (6, 1), then DOWN to (6, 0) in 3 steps.\n*   Moving UP (8, 2) seems indecisive regarding $E$.\n*   Moving RIGHT (9, 1) is safe but takes us away from $E$.\n\nMoving **LEFT (7, 1)** is the most efficient path towards $E(6, 0)$.\n\n### 4. Collision Check and Enemy Prediction (H1 at 3, 6)\n\nH1's path towards $A(0, 8)$ is clearly defined:\n1.  **UP (3, 7):** H1 needs 2 steps to reach $A(0, 8)$.\n2.  **LEFT (2, 8):**\n3.  **UP (1, 8):**\n4.  **LEFT (0, 8):**\n\nWait, let's map H1's current required moves:\nH1 (3, 6). Neck (3, 7).\nTarget $A(0, 8)$.\n\n| Move | New Position | Capture? | Rationale |\n| :--: | :----------: | :------: | :--------: |\n| UP | (3, 7) | No | **FATAL.** Moves into neck cell (3, 7). |\n| DOWN | (3, 5) | No | Moves away from target. |\n| LEFT | (2, 6) | No | Safe, leads towards (1, 6) $T_B(1, 6)$. |\n| RIGHT | (4, 6) | No | Moves away from target. |\n\nAh, the structure of H1's body: `[(3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8)]`...\nCurrent H1 head is (3, 6). Previous head was (3, 7).\nThe segment at (3, 7) is now the neck. A move UP to (3, 7) kills H1.\n\nH1 must move away from its neck (3, 7).\nOptions for H1: DOWN (3, 5), LEFT (2, 6), or RIGHT (4, 6).\n\nIf H1 wants $A(0, 8)$:\n1. LEFT (2, 6).\n2. UP (2, 7) - **CRASH!** Hits segment (2, 7).\n3. LEFT (1, 6).\n4. UP (1, 7) - **CRASH!** Hits segment (1, 7).\n\nH1 is currently trapped by its own body, which forms a dense L-shape protecting $A(0, 8)$.\nH1 Body segments: (3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 2).\n\nH1 at (3, 6).\nIf H1 moves LEFT to (2, 6). This is safe.\nNext turn, H1 is at (2, 6). Neck is (3, 6).\nOptions: UP (2, 7) = Crash (Body). DOWN (2, 5) = Safe. LEFT (1, 6) = Crash (Body). RIGHT (3, 6) = Crash (Neck). H1 is forced to move DOWN, away from $A(0, 8)$.\n\nIt appears H1 is either forced to move away, or is trapped in a way that risks self-collision if it tries to go for $A(0, 8)$.\n\nH0's move is **LEFT** to (7, 1). This is completely safe and sets up the capture of $E(6, 0)$ in 2 subsequent moves (LEFT, DOWN).\n\n### 5. Strategy Refinement\n\nH0 should aggressively pursue $E(6, 0)$ while H1 is potentially struggling to maneuver out of its corner or is forced away from its nearest target $A(0, 8)$.\n\n1.  T42: H0 moves **LEFT** (8, 1) -> (7, 1). Target $E(6, 0)$.\n2.  T43: H0 moves LEFT (7, 1) -> (6, 1).\n3.  T44: H0 moves DOWN (6, 1) -> (6, 0). Capture $E$. Score 12.\n\nIf H1 does manage to escape and heads for $C(3, 1)$ or $D(3, 0)$, we will be equally matched in target hunting. Securing $E(6, 0)$ is the priority now.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T43/T44)**\nT42 (Current): **LEFT** to (7, 1), aiming for $E(6, 0)$.\nT43: Move LEFT to (6, 1).\nT44: Move DOWN to (6, 0). Capture $E$.\n\nLEFT",

My body now runs from head (3,6) through the listed segments to tail (2,2). The apples are at (0,8), (1,0), (3,1), (3,0), (6,0). Enemy snake #0's head is at (8,1).\n\n**Step 1: Check each direction for immediate death.**\n- **UP** to (3,7): That's my own body (second segment). **NOT safe.**\n- **DOWN** to (3,5): Within board. Cell is empty (`.`). Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n- **LEFT** to (2,6): Within board. Cell is empty (`.`). Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n- **RIGHT** to (4,6): Within board. Cell is empty (`.`). Not my body. Not enemy body. **Safe.**\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate safe moves for apple proximity and future options.**\nFrom (3,6):\n- **DOWN** to (3,5): No apple. Manhattan distances to apples: (0,8)=|3-0|+|5-8|=3+3=6, (1,0)=|3-1|+|5-0|=2+5=7, (3,1)=|3-3|+|5-1|=0+4=4, (3,0)=|3-3|+|5-0|=0+5=5, (6,0)=|3-6|+|5-0|=3+5=8. Closest is (3,1) distance 4.\n- **LEFT** to (2,6): No apple. Distances: (0,8)=|2-0|+|6-8|=2+2=4, (1,0)=|2-1|+|6-0|=1+6=7, (3,1)=|2-3|+|6-1|=1+5=6, (3,0)=|2-3|+|6-0|=1+6=7, (6,0)=|2-6|+|6-0|=4+6=10. Closest is (0,8) distance 4.\n- **RIGHT** to (4,6): No apple. Distances: (0,8)=|4-0|+|6-8|=4+2=6, (1,0)=|4-1|+|6-0|=3+6=9, (3,1)=|4-3|+|6-1|=1+5=6, (3,0)=|4-3|+|6-0|=1+6=7, (6,0)=|4-6|+|6-0|=2+6=8. Closest are (0,8) and (3,1) both distance 6.\n\n**Step 3: Consider future move options after each choice.**\nIf I move **DOWN** to (3,5):\n- Next turn from (3,5): UP to (3,6) is my body (second segment) \u2014 unsafe. DOWN to (3,4) empty. LEFT to (2,5) empty. RIGHT to (4,5) empty. So three safe moves.\n- This moves me toward the cluster of apples at (3,1) and (3,0).\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (2,6):\n- Next turn from (2,6): UP to (2,7) is my body (third segment?) \u2014 check: my body after move: head (2,6), then (3,6), (3,7), (2,7)... so (2,7) is third segment \u2014 unsafe. DOWN to (2,5) empty. LEFT to (1,6) empty? Board shows (1,6) is 'T' (my body). Actually, my body includes (1,6) as the 7th segment. So LEFT is unsafe. RIGHT to (3,6) is my body \u2014 unsafe. Only DOWN is safe. That's a dead-end next turn \u2014 very risky.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (4,6):\n- Next turn from (4,6): UP to (4,7) empty. DOWN to (4,5) empty. LEFT to (3,6) is my body \u2014 unsafe. RIGHT to (5,6) empty. So three safe moves.\n- This moves me toward the center-right, but away from the closest apples.\n\n**Step 4: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions.**\nEnemy head at (8,1). It is likely to move toward the apple at (6,0) or (3,0). The distance to my target cells is large, so no immediate collision risk. However, moving LEFT into (2,6) could box me in, as seen.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan.**\nI have an apple lead (11 vs 11 tied). I need to secure more apples safely. The apples at (3,1) and (3,0) are directly below me and reachable via DOWN moves. Moving DOWN now keeps multiple options open and progresses toward that cluster. Moving LEFT is too dangerous due to limited future moves. RIGHT is safe but less direct.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN is the best move\u2014it maintains maneuverability and moves me toward the densest apple area while avoiding traps.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After moving to (3,5), assess moves toward (3,1)/(3,0). Consider that enemy may be heading toward (6,0). I should continue downward cautiously, ensuring I don't box myself in. If enemy moves toward my area, I may need to divert to (0,8) via leftward moves later.\n\nDOWN",
