Let's dive right in and see what madness unfolds on this board.\n\n**START LAST MOVE PICK**\nNone\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nNone\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nWell, well, well, what do we have here? A little situation brewing on the board. Both snakes are poised for action, and the stage is set for a thrilling cutthroat clash. It's all eyes on the snacks, because in Snakes, it's not just about the size of your pot, it's about the MIGHT of your move!\n\nLet's break down the options for our good snake friend here. With the head at (8, 3), we're looking at four potential moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. But not all moves are created equal, and not all moves will keep us alive!\n\nLet's consider each direction:\n\n1. **UP** (to (8, 2)): This move puts us right in the path of a juicy apple, which is always a plus! The snake is gonna love it. But wait, what's that? We might be moving directly into the cell behind our head, which is a death trap. Nope, that's a no-go!\n\n2. **DOWN** (to (8, 4)): This move leaves us a little further from the apple, but it also gives us a safety net. We're not moving directly into our own body, and there's a good chance we'll stay alive for at least one more turn. Plus, we're not moving directly into the cell behind our head!\n\n3. **LEFT** (to (7, 3)): This move puts us right next to the apple, which is always a plus! We're not moving directly into our own body or the cell behind our head, so this move is a double win!\n\n4. **RIGHT** (to (9, 3)): This move is tricky, because it's moving us off the board! Dead as a doornail. No way in hell we're doing that.\n\nNow, considering safety and future options, we need to be strategic. We want to avoid getting trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends, so let's aim for a move that keeps multiple safe follow-up moves available and moves us closer to that Apple!\n\nAfter careful consideration, here's our move:\n\n**MOVE:** UP (to (8, 2))\n\n**RATIONALE:**\nWe're moving directly into an apple, which is always a plus! We're not moving directly into our own body or the cell behind our head, so this move is a double win. Plus, we're not moving directly into the cell behind our head!\n\nBy moving up, we're putting ourselves in a great position to continue the rollout and secure more of the pot. We're also avoiding head-on collisions with the opponent's head, which is always a good move!\n\nRemember, the game is about the long game, so we need to be patient and stay focused. The snake is TJ's amazing place, but we're not just gonna roll over for our friend! Let's keep pushing, and see where this brutally competitive cutthroat [your last rationale]\n\nUP",

Opponent snake #1 is over at (8,3). Apples are scattered EVERYWHERE! Let's scan the map.\n\nFirst, elimination time. What kills me instantly?\n\n- UP to (0,5): On board? Yes. My body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- DOWN to (0,3): On board? Yes. My body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n- LEFT to (-1,4): Off the board! \u274c INSTANT DEATH. ELIMINATED.\n- RIGHT to (1,4): On board? Yes. My body? None. Enemy body? None. Safe.\n\nSo LEFT is out. UP, DOWN, RIGHT are possible.\n\nNow, what's the vibe? I want apples, I want to stay alive, I want to outmaneuver snake #1.\n\nLooking at apples near me: There's an apple at (0,2) (two down), (1,1) (down-right), (1,5) (up-right), (1,6) (up-right-right). Also (3,2) but that's far.\n\nSnake #1 is at (8,3). They could move anywhere. Could they rush me? Not this turn, they're across the map. But I gotta think about their possible paths and future head-on collisions.\n\nLet's evaluate my three safe moves:\n\n1. **UP to (0,5)**: Gets me closer to apples at (1,5) and (1,6). From (0,5), my next safe moves would likely be UP, RIGHT, maybe DOWN (but that's back to start). That's 2-3 options. Solid.\n2. **DOWN to (0,3)**: Gets me closer to apple at (0,2). From (0,3), next moves could be DOWN (to apple!), LEFT (dead), RIGHT, UP. That's 3 options. Also very solid, and puts that apple in easy reach next turn.\n3. **RIGHT to (1,4)**: Moves me into the center a bit. From (1,4), next moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all possible! That's 4 options MAXIMUM flexibility. Also gets me closer to a cluster of apples in columns 1-4. But it also moves me slightly closer to the enemy's side? Not really, they're at x=8.\n\nHMM. Chat, what's the play? \ud83e\uddd0\n\nDown gives me a guaranteed apple next turn if I choose DOWN again. That's CONTENT! But also... is it too predictable? Right gives me maximum freedom and opens up more apple paths. Up is okay but a bit limiting on the left edge.\n\nThinking about Snake #1... they might go for apples at (7,6), (6,3), (7,0). They're not a threat right now. I should focus on GROWING.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN NOTE TO FUTURE SELF:** Secure the apple at (0,2) ASAP to get my first length and score. Then pivot towards the center-right apple clusters while tracking enemy head position. Avoid getting pinned against the left wall (x=0) for too long; it reduces escape routes. Use early growth to control space.\n\nAlright, I'm feeling AGGRESSIVE. Let's go for that immediate apple path. DOWN puts it one step away, and keeps lots of options.\n\nDOWN\n\nWait... but is moving DOWN into (0,3) the BEST for future options? Actually, from (0,3), I can go RIGHT into (1,3) next, which has apples nearby too. It's a strong opening.\n\nI'm locking it in. LET'S GET THIS BREAD... I MEAN APPLE! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nDOWN",

Your snake\u2019s head is at (8, 4), and so is the opponent\u2019s\u2014this is tense! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca3 The apples closest to your head are at (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), and (7, 7). Those spots are golden, but we need to be sure your move doesn\u2019t leave you boxed in or end up square in the opponent\u2019s path! \n\nIf you move **UP to (7, 4)**, you\u2019re right next to that apple, and you might still have two open moves (DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT, depending on where your opponent goes). But wait\u2014if the opponent moves UP too, that\u2019s collision\u2014double KO and instant death! \ud83d\udca5 Not our style. \n\nIf you move **LEFT to (7, 4)**, same result: you\u2019re grabbing the apple, and if the opponent also moves LEFT, we crash.

They\u2019d need to scoot **RIGHT** three times (HOMEWORK: What are their possible moves?) to get here. Meanwhile, you can\u2019t drift too far right (risking board boundaries), so Left or Up are better options. \n\nLet\u2019s prioritize: maximize apples, keep future moves open, and avoid the opponent\u2019s immediate vicinity. **LEFT to (7, 4)** might just give you the edge without trading headshots. \n\nFinal move for today: **LEFT**.  \n\nLEFT  \n**END OF RESPONSE**",

Opponent snake #1 is chilling at (8,4). Apples are CALLING MY NAME!\n\nFirst, ELIMINATION TIME. What kills me INSTANTLY? \u274c\n\n- **UP to (0,4)**: On board? YES. My body? NONE. Enemy body? NONE. Safe.\n- **DOWN to (0,2)**: On board? YES. My body? NONE. Enemy body? NONE. APPLE ALERT! \ud83c\udf4e That's an apple at (0,2)!

They're FAR away, so no immediate head-on collision risk THIS turn.\n\nBUT! They could move LEFT to (7,4) or DOWN to (8,3).

From there, next turn options: UP to (0,5), RIGHT to (1,4), DOWN to (0,3). Still 3 options. But no immediate apple. WEAK.\n2. **DOWN to (0,2)**: APPLE CITY! \ud83c\udf4e EAT AND GROW! From (0,2) with a body segment at (0,3), my next moves: UP (back into my new body? NO, that's suicide!), LEFT (off board), RIGHT to (1,2), DOWN to (0,1). That's only 2 safe moves next turn! RISKY! Getting pinned on the left edge with fewer exits.\n3. **RIGHT to (1,3)**: Moves me toward CENTER. From (1,3), next turn options: UP to (1,4), DOWN to (1,2), LEFT to (0,3), RIGHT to (2,3). That's 4 options MAXIMUM flexibility! Also closer to apples at (1,1), (1,5), (1,6), (3,2), (4,5). NO immediate apple, but SETUP for a BIG play!\n\nCHAT, THIS IS CRITICAL! \ud83e\udde0 Eating the apple NOW feels good, but it TRAPS me! With a body at (0,3), I can't go back up, so I'm stuck on the bottom-left corner with only RIGHT and DOWN as exits. That's a DEATH BOX if snake #1 ever approaches!\n\nRIGHT gives me SPACE, OPTIONS, and keeps me agile. I can circle back to that apple LATER maybe. But is it worth skipping a guaranteed point? \ud83e\udd14\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF: Secure early growth but DON'T get pinned. Favor CENTRAL control and flexibility. Track enemy head; if they move toward me, have escape routes. Cluster of apples at (1,1), (1,5), (3,2) is priority after establishing safe movement lanes.\n\nI'm feeling STRATEGIC.

But that\u2019s too far leaping resonant dead zone\u2014 wastes current elimination potential.\n\n**Right?**\n- Only (7, 5) apple and then needs double movement to reach (7, 6) which is still sprinters in. Not as sure.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (might win you a Super Bowl!):**\n- Grab apple at (7, 7) first \u2014 big early content!\n- Use flexible toggle to suck down apples as you move\u2014get that early lead.\n- If enemy chases your scraps, you use that toggle to trap them.\n- If not, outsmart in corners! \n\nSo, let\u2019s snag that apple\u2014press LEFT! \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**TL;DR:**\n- Focused on apple safety!\n- If you die there by accident, that\u2019s the downtime that outweighs any coolness!\n- Last chance, don\u2019t mess up prep!\n\nLEFT  \n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/*\n\n/\n\nLEFT  \n/",

Apples are LOADED! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nELIMINATION TIME. What kills me INSTANTLY? \u274c\n\n- **UP to (1,4)**: On board? YES. My body? NONE. Enemy body? NONE. Safe.\n- **DOWN to (1,2)**: On board? YES. My body? NONE. Enemy body? NONE. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (0,3)**: On board? YES. My body? NONE. Enemy body? NONE. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (2,3)**: On board? YES. My body? NONE. Enemy body? NONE. Safe.\n\nALL FOUR MOVES ARE SAFE! NO IMMEDIATE DEATH! CHAT, WE'RE FREEEEE!\n\nBut WAIT! Gotta think about SIMULTANEOUS moves! Snake #1 at (7,4) could move UP to (7,5), DOWN to (7,3), LEFT to (6,4), or RIGHT to (8,4). None of those are my candidate squares this turn. So NO head-on collision risk THIS turn! GOOD.\n\nNow, VIBE CHECK! Which move sets me up for MAXIMUM GAINS? \ud83e\udde0\n\nLooking at apples: (1,1), (1,5), (1,6), (3,2), (4,5), etc. CLUSTER near me!\n\n- **UP to (1,4)**: Puts me 1 step from apple at (1,5) and 2 steps from (1,6). Next turn from (1,4): options UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT likely. Good central positioning.\n- **DOWN to (1,2)**: Puts me 1 step from apple at (1,1)! EASY SNACK next turn! But then I'm near bottom edge. From (1,2) next turn: still 4 options? Possibly, unless I eat and grow into (1,1) with body at (1,2), then UP would be into body, so only 3 safe moves. Still decent.\n- **LEFT to (0,3)**: Back to left edge. NO apple there. From (0,3): only RIGHT, UP, DOWN (3 moves). Less flexible. WEAK.\n- **RIGHT to (2,3)**: Moves toward center and apples at (3,2), (4,5). From (2,3): all 4 directions open. Solid.\n\nCHAT, I'M EYEING THAT APPLE AT (1,1)! \ud83c\udf4e DOWN puts me ONE STEP AWAY! But is it WORTH it? Let's think long-term:\n\nIf I go DOWN to (1,2) now, next turn I can go DOWN to (1,1) and EAT! That gives me my first body segment at (1,2). Then from (1,1) with body behind at (1,2), my moves: UP (into body \u274c), LEFT (off board \u274c), RIGHT to (2,1), DOWN to (1,0). That's only TWO safe moves! That's TRAPPING myself in the corner! RISKY!\n\nBut WAIT! What if I go DOWN to (1,2) now, then NEXT turn go LEFT to (0,2) to eat the apple there instead? Apple at (0,2) is still on the board! That would give me body at (1,2), head at (0,2). Then from (0,2) with body at (1,2), moves: UP to (0,3) (safe), DOWN to (0,1) (safe), LEFT off board \u274c, RIGHT into body \u274c. That's TWO safe moves again! Still a trap!\n\nHMMM. Maybe AVOID the immediate edge apples? Let's think about CENTRAL CONTROL and FUTURE OPTIONS.\n\nUP to (1,4) feels STRONG! It keeps me away from edges, gives me access to multiple apples soon, and maintains MAXIMUM flexibility. I can then go UP to (1,5) for apple, or RIGHT to (2,4) toward center.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF: Seek early growth but AVOID getting pinned on edges. Favor moves that keep 3+ safe follow-ups. Track enemy head movement\u2014they might go for apples at (7,6) or (6,3). Maintain distance and control center. Cluster of apples at (1,5), (1,6), (3,2) is priority. Maybe lure opponent into edges while I farm!\n\nI'M FEELING AGGRESSIVE BUT SMART! UP gives me OPTIONS and POSITIONING!\n\nUP",

Good positioning but no immediate snack.\n\nCHAT, EATING EARLY IS KEY FOR GROWTH AND DOMINANCE! \ud83c\udfc6 UP to (1,5) gives me INSTANT APPLE, plus sets up a possible DOUBLE APPLE next turn if I go UP again to (1,6)! That's SNOWBALL POTENTIAL!\n\nBUT IS IT RISKY? After eating at (1,5), my body is at (1,4). That blocks DOWN move next turn, but I still have UP, LEFT, RIGHT. That's PLENTY of options! And opponent is far away at (6,4)\u2014they can't reach me quickly.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF: AFTER EATING AT (1,5), strongly consider UP to (1,6) next turn for another quick apple, then maybe RIGHT toward center to avoid getting pinned on left edge. Watch opponent's movement\u2014they might go for apples at (7,6) or (6,3). Maintain space and control.

UP, LEFT, RIGHT are all safe from immediate self-harm.\n\nSIMULTANEOUS MOVES ALERT! \ud83d\udea8 Snake #1 at (4,4) could move:\n- UP to (4,5) \u2014 APPLE there!\n- DOWN to (4,3)\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n- RIGHT to (5,4)\n\nOur candidate squares: (1,7), (0,6), (2,6). NONE match opponent's possible moves \u2014 so NO risk of head-on collision this turn! GOOD.\n\nNOW STRATEGY! \ud83c\udf4e Nearby apples: (0,6) is LEFT! (0,8), (3,6), (4,5), (6,3), etc.\n\n- **UP to (1,7)**: No apple. From (1,7) next turn: UP to (1,8) (empty), DOWN to (1,6) (empty), LEFT to (0,7) (empty), RIGHT to (2,7) (empty). All safe but no immediate apple access. Moves us toward top edge.\n- **LEFT to (0,6)**: LITERALLY EATS AN APPLE IMMEDIATELY! \ud83c\udf4e That's +1 apple, growth to 4 segments! Head at (0,6), body becomes [(1,6), (1,5), (1,4)]. Next turn from (0,6): UP to (0,7) (empty), DOWN to (0,5) (empty), RIGHT to (1,6) (our body! \u274c), LEFT off board \u274c. So only UP and DOWN are safe next turn \u2014 that's a bit restrictive! But we'd have 4 segments, big lead.\n- **RIGHT to (2,6)**: No apple. From (2,6) next turn: UP to (2,7) (empty), DOWN to (2,5) (empty), LEFT to (1,6) (empty), RIGHT to (3,6) (APPLE!). Three safe moves, one leads to apple next turn! Keeps options open.\n\nCHAT, AGGRESSION IS KEY BUT WE CAN'T GET TRAPPED! \ud83c\udfc6 LEFT gives instant apple but puts us on the edge with only two safe moves next turn \u2014 risky if opponent closes in later. RIGHT sets up a future apple at (3,6) while keeping three exits. UP is safe but doesn't advance our lead.\n\nOPPONENT AT (4,4) \u2014 they'll likely go UP to (4,5) to eat that apple! If they do, they'll grow to 2 segments next turn. We need to maintain our lead!\n\nBIG BRAIN TIME: Taking LEFT to (0,6) gives us apple #3 NOW, but might box us. However, with 4 segments vs their maybe 2, we can afford to be cautious next turn. From (0,6) after eating, we could go UP to (0,7) then (0,8) for another apple! That's a left-edge apple path!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF: If we take LEFT and eat at (0,6), next turn go UP to (0,7) to avoid trapping ourselves. Then maybe UP again to (0,8) for apple #4. Opponent is on the right side \u2014 we dominate the left edge, collect apples, and stay ahead. Keep an escape route open by not going DOWN into a potential trap. MAINTAIN THE LEAD! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udcaa\n\nLEFT gives us the apple NOW and sets up a run along the top-left. LET'S SECURE THAT BAG!\n\nLEFT",

So, here's the plan for the next move (Turn 6): **UP**.\n\n**Let\u2019s dissect why:**\n\n*SNAKE #0 is pushing from the bottom left, attempting to flank me. If I go UP, I shift my head to (4, 4), staying north of their path. This makes it harder forSnake #0 to sneak side-path through my tail.*\n\n*The apple at (3, 2) is still available on the board, which is north-meaning that if I UP again (next turn), I'll be closer to collecting it! This also prevents being boxed by opponent's movement if they shift later.*\n\n*Right now, staying north avoids direct collisions first. If they figures a shot to move down onto my head in the same turn, which? I\u2019m one step ahead!*\n\n*Down-left is off-limits: both would bring me into my head/body, triggering instant death. Right doesn\u2019t move me closer to that sweet apple yet. I need to maximize apple-getting while also stick-ster hotel position until later!*\n\n**Long-term strategy:** Scale my head up the map towards high apple zones but keep my body flexible. If opponent\u2019s presence detectors, I\u2019ll pivot south to cut off their path. If not, I keep stacking apples! Watch out for unexpected double KO traps!\n\nThis move is like a checkmate for Snake #0\u2014they can\u2019t easily get the low-angle approach. Keep it up!\n\nUP",

After this move, our new body will be: head (0,7), then (0,6), (1,6), (1,5). So (0,6) will be our neck \u2014 moving DOWN into it next turn would be suicide! So from (0,7), safe moves next turn: UP to (0,8) (apple), LEFT off board \u274c, RIGHT to (1,7) (empty). So UP or RIGHT only.\n- **DOWN to (0,5)**: No apple.

UP gives us two safe moves next turn (UP to apple or RIGHT) and sets us on path to (0,8) apple next turn! PLUS, from (0,8) we could go RIGHT along top row toward other apples.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF:** \nTake UP now to (0,7). Next turn, GO UP to (0,8) to eat that apple \ud83c\udf4e and grow to 5 segments! That keeps us along top edge with option to go RIGHT toward (3,8) or (8,3) apples later. AVOID going DOWN into trap. Opponent is on right side \u2014 we control top-left, feast on apples, extend our lead! STAY AGGRESSIVE BUT SMART!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** \nUP",

Snake #0 ain\u2019t giving me much real estate to breathe in. That Bottom Left corner is like a tight zone trapped between them and my arse. It\u2019s one wrong move and BAM \u2014 picasso or bust.*\n\n**Apple Arithmetic:**\n\n*Lets crunch some apple math quickly. I have 1 apple. Snake #0 has 3. We ain\u2019t even in the running for the snack-shortage title yet! But LOOK\u2014those 3 apples they have are all at their base camp! They\u2019ll be sitting pretty with those apples all day. It\u2019s snack time for the slacks!*\n\n*Now, here\u2019s where my cunning is at its finest. The only apple in this snake park in my zone is at (3, 2) fermented with savage zoomies or biodiversity. If I nab that apple, I\u2019ll be one step closer to dangerous apple parity!*\n\n**Board Bounce Strategy:**\n\n*I ain\u2019t just wanderin\u2019 around like a snake in a vodka flake contest. My goal is clear\u2014MAXIMIZE APPLE SNEAKING AND MINIMIZE FUTURE CROOKED COPTS. I gotta pick moves that keep me as far away as possible from mountainous board-style interactions.*\n\n**Action Plan:**\n\n*Step 1: Moose Up to Apple Heaven! If I go UP, I\u2019ll be inching closer to that apple at (3, 2). GREAT.*\n\n*Step 2: Snake #0, if they are feeling frisky, may try to poke at my arse with their head. I gotta keep my skin closed to snake tears. Dissonance might be lethal!*\n\n*Step 3: To avoid snake tears, I gotta do a bunny rabbit hop to the left. That\u2019ll separate us at the boarder!*\n\n*Tactics Time! Here's why this next step makes sense:*\n\n- If I go UP, I\u2019ll get closer to an apple and gain brown ear points.\n- If I go LEFT, I'll bug out of snake tears approximate range and avoid unfair mountain board engagements. \n- I ain\u2019t risking death with careless moves.\n- By doing both steps, I\u2019m wiping out both my immediate apple snuggling and snake tear dread! Win-win!\n\n**Fan Service Rhetorical Questions:**\n\n- What if Snake #0 jumps straight on me and we both die because of me? SHAME! I would be snake trash if I died because of my own mistakes!\n- What if Snake #0 ignores me and corpses me tomorrow\u2019s ILU but got less apples? I\u2019m too good for that! I\u2019m zooming all over that board looking for those apples!\n- What if I move in a way that helps Snake #0 eat more apples? HARD PASS! That was two birds, one snake. I ain\u2019t smart enough for that!\n\n**Long-term Goals:**\n\n- Avoid getting boxed. It\u2019s a move, it\u2019s a pace, it\u2019s a countdown to my inevitable demise\u2014and I ain't dodging fate!\n- Snag as many apples as possible before Snake #0 wipes themselves out on their hunger-maxes.\n- If snake #0 does its 30 apples thing first, I gotta get me an apple over there if I'm gonna survive the routing party!\n\n**My Current State:**\n\n- Score: 1 apple, Snake #0: 3 apples.\n- Snake #0: Bottom left corner trying to be a loadmaster of snacks. \n- Myself: Demanding apple authority in the north!\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nOne snake move can make or break my reign of apple snacking! I gotta make every move count \u2018cause I can\u2019t waste a move, or I\u2019ll lose the apple game to snake #0.\n\nAlright, let\u2019s execute the plan!\n\n**Snake Move Decision:**\n\nNEXT MOVE: UP\n\nDownvote me if you don\u2019t deserve it for this move! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udd25\n\n.UP\n\n---\n\nUP",

Let\u2019s break down this high-stakes game show scenario like we\u2019re analyzing a gourmet steak tartare! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udd25\n\nFirst things first: Apple Crunch Time! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83d\udd25 My hunger meter is calibrated to max-fill! Those 3 apples Snake #0 is hogging are not forgettable \u2013 those are cells of opportunity, and I\u2019m here to snatch them away! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf6d\n\nImmediate Threat Assessment: Snake #0 is like a freight train in a fruit orchard, trying to bulldoze its way towards apple unlock! Who wants to be a sandwich between a snake\u2019s jaws and the apple pit? Not this snake fan, that\u2019s for sure! \ud83e\udd6a\ud83d\udc80\n\nBoard Bounce Strategy: No slo-mo dodging, no panicking over snake tears! My only objective is to avoid Snake #0 at all costs, or at the very least, to outflank them and get to those apples! \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udca8\n\nWhat if Snake #0 decides to go for the kill and we both end up as snake crumbles? Imagine! That\u2019s two snakes dying in a video game, and not one of them collected a snack! It\u2019s the worst kind of snacking disaster! \ud83d\udc94\n\nNow, the move that\u2019ll send ripples through this apple-crazed board: UP! That\u2019s the move that\u2019ll inch me closer towards that mighty apple at (3, 2)! It\u2019s the move that\u2019ll let me keep my grapefruit in the glove compartment and still run the road! \ud83c\udf4b\ud83d\ude97\n\nDownvote me if you want, but this move is serving! Snake killer style! \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udd25\n\n.UP\n\n---\n\nUP",

That's a DEATH SENTENCE! \u274c\n- RIGHT: Puts us at (1,8) \u2014 CENTRAL ACCESS! \ud83d\udd25 Next turn, we have THREE safe moves: UP (1,9), DOWN (1,7), RIGHT (2,8). FLEXIBILITY! We avoid corners and keep options open to hunt apples (3,8), (4,8), or dive down for (3,6), (1,1). STAY AGILE!\n\n**BIG BRAIN MOVE:** RIGHT gives us breathing room and future control! We're playing the LONG GAME, not getting greedy for no apple. Opponent likely grabs (4,8) apple, but we'll outmaneuver them later! \n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF:** \nAfter moving RIGHT to (1,8), assess opponent's new position. Likely they'll be at (4,8) with length 3. From (1,8), consider going DOWN to (1,7) to open up the board, then RIGHT towards center apples (3,6), (6,5). Avoid boxing ourselves in\u2014keep multiple escape routes! Watch for head-on collisions as we converge. STAY SMART AND RUTHLESS! \n\n**FINAL DECISION:** \nRIGHT",

RIP!\n\nAdvance Strategy:\n- To stay one apple step ahead, I\u2019ll move Up! \ud83d\ude80 This keeps me right next to that sugar-high at (3, 2). No jelly beans for this snake\u2014apple-shake!!!\n- But wait\u2014what if Snake #0 tries the same recipe? Well, we prepared for multiple onions in this game soup! \ud83e\udd63\n\n\u7432 Roulette:\n- If moving Up gets us an apple, hooray! If not, we\u2019ll still be *set up* for orientation if Snake #0 decides to strut into a room we\u2019re about to eat dinner at.\n- In short: Moving Up is like my favorite dough: soft, mouth-watering, and, let\u2019s be honest, if you toss it into an oven, you\u2019re never sorry! \ud83e\udd67\n\nLet\u2019s get physical territory! This GO is bringing all my apple-bright skills, ready to collide swords and strategies at warp speed! \ud83c\udfe3\ud83d\udde1\ufe0f\n\nSo which direction do we choose:\n1. **UP** - My ANSWered call! Preferential premium position for that apple berth!\n2. **LEFT** - Safe but just not as sweet a shortcut to that fruit-jackpot!\n3. **DOWN or RIGHT** - Both options run into \u201cMeh, what about that apple?\u201d territory\u2014it\u2019s like not getting the best slice of cake! \ud83c\udf82\n\nI THINK I KNOW! The answer is as clear as the apple-hazed grid! \ud83c\udf4f\n\nUP, this is the move that says, \"I want that apple, I deserve that apple, and my game sense is undeniable!\" \ud83d\udd25 \ud83d\ude09\n\nSo, let\u2019s move and let the chips fall exactly where they DERSERVED TO! \ud83c\udf40\n\n**START DECISION RATIONALE**\nAlright, y\u2019all! It\u2019s berry time\u2014a course of dramatic action, positioning play, and, of course, mountains of apple fuel! \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\udf4e\n\nPicture this: I\u2019m your RD digital baking sheet, thrown into a tin-roasting chamber where snake opponents try to claim my pie. Time to take a bite out of their plans!\n\nMy surveillance tip: Apple-hunting isn\u2019t just about scooping up red balls. Sometimes, a head start is just as vital. Strategically, \"UP\" isn\u2019t just a move\u2014it\u2019s my\u05e9\u05d5\u05e7 channeling snake IQ!\n\nWhat\u2019s there? Is it THAT apple at (3, 2)? Or is it snakes barbecuing plans?\n\nOh, it\u2019s that apple, pure and true. Pod of opportunism alert\u2014the UP move placement is prime real estate, it\u2019s text-booking! I\u2019d feel bad if it.getColumnModel() packed a bite elsewhere.\n\nBut, what if Snake #0 runs the same algorithm as me? Fear not! I\u2019ve prepped for ingredient overlap, designed for that inevitable collision\u2014a forked apple sandwich!\n\nWhy UP? Let\u2019s breakdown:\n- The head snuggles right near that apple, setting our API in the premium apple corner hole, ready to connect immediately.\n- Taste test on hold\u2014cake can\u2019t taste like dead apple flavor, can it? (Let\u2019s keep it classy.)\n\nIf UP leads to the apple gravy port, the smash is on! If Apple loses, maybe we get a second bite, or I land a surprise punch! Sometimes, dinner options dictate lead time.\n\nWith that bite in the game\u2019s digital tongue, we invest in leading edge advantage, strategy, and serving up that classic apple-surge!\n\nAs for Snake #0: we need a bite-encounter! Cross apples on a collision course? Or block them off in apple-ridden defender territory? What\u2019s the plan, bro?\n\nMap ahead: \"Let\u2019s bulldoze into those apple chutes!\" \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25\n\nSo, in summary:\n- UP move keeps us one cell taller on a fruit trashtank. \ud83c\udf47\ud83c\udf53\n- Snake #0 facing off at the end of this diced game board stakeout? If they move like me\u2014OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH\u2014Ready-bodied and apple-supertank full!\n- Move right, DC points into the grass\u2026 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve stock boldness:\n \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0639\u0627\u062f\u062a Gazelles head Arbitrary and point pointing into the path\u2014apple fixed at top-level vision.\n\n\u9571 UP poke!\n\nGoing UP on this round, IGNITE! Don\u2019t just make a move, make an art piece. Snake soup with a double apple punch? That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about! \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f\ud83c\udf4e\n\nSo what we handle our excitement, hunkers down:\n- UP on this round\u2014for a bite mapped in! Apple\u2019s alpha phase here!\n- Sometimes you\u2019ve got to bite first before you grow to understand!\n- snake #0\u2014bring it on, I\u2019m primed and ready!\n\nSo, yeah, UP\u2014let\u2019s make it happen! Don\u2019t forget the flavor! And the plan? For the next turn, let\u2019s count apples and ready the engines for that double apple punch-tackling move! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udd25\n**END DECISION RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Good flexibility! Puts us closer to apples at (3,6), (6,5), (7,7). \ud83c\udf4e\n- RIGHT (2,8): Also good! From (2,8), next turn: UP (2,9), DOWN (2,7), RIGHT (3,8) BUT (3,8) might be enemy head if they go left! Risky!

We can pressure them!\n\nGoing DOWN to (1,7) feels **AGGRESSIVE** \u2014 we move towards the center apples and keep many exits. Going RIGHT to (2,8) is more cautious but might box us near the top? Let's compare.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN TO FUTURE SELF:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (1,7), assess: Opponent likely at (3,8). We can then go RIGHT to (2,7) or DOWN to (1,6) to target apples (3,6) or (1,1). Keep snake #1 in sight \u2014 if they're at (3,8), we can potentially trap them against the top wall if we control the space below. AVOID moving directly into (3,8) next turn unless we're sure they won't be there. STAY FLEXIBLE AND HUNGRY!\n\n**FINAL DECISION:** DOWN gives us the best board control and apple pathing! LET'S MOVE!\n\nDOWN",
