Let\u2019s break it down.\n\n- UP to (1,5) keeps me moving toward that juicy cluster around (3,5)/(4,5), but I\u2019d be hugging the left wall a bit. Feels safe and opens the path north.\n- DOWN to (1,3) keeps things neutral, but it\u2019s pulling me away from apples and doesn\u2019t pressure the enemy.\n- LEFT to (0,4) just hugs the border with no apples nearby\u2014feels like a dead-end brewing soon.\n- RIGHT to (2,4) slides me toward the center, keeps multiple follow-ups available, and keeps my eyes on both the (3,5) apple and whatever the rival wants to do on the right side.\n\nNo immediate threats, no head-on bait, so I\u2019m going central and keeping the map unlocked. Can I keep the pressure while staying smart? You bet I can. \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udd25\n\nPlan for the next few turns: keep drawing toward the (3,5)/(4,5)/(4,7) apple cluster while keeping my options open to zigzag away from the rival\u2019s path if he tries to bully me, and always leave a backdoor to the perimeter rather than hemming myself in.\n\nRIGHT",

This is THE moment to establish dominance! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nLet me break down the position:\n- **My snake (ID 1)**: Head at (8, 4) - that's RIGHT side, middle height\n- **Enemy snake #0**: Head at (1, 4) - that's LEFT side, same Y coordinate!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 DECISION TIME - LET'S THINK OUT LOUD:\n\n**Available moves check:**\n- **UP**: (8, 5) - safe, moving toward apples at (9, 5), (7, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8)\n- **DOWN**: (8, 3) - safe, moving toward apples at (9, 3), (7, 3)\n- **LEFT**: (7, 4) - safe, moving toward apples at (6, 4)\n- **RIGHT**: (9, 4) - safe, moving toward edge but not off the board\n\nNone of these kill me immediately \u2705\n\n**Strategic Analysis** \ud83c\udfaf\n\nOkay chat, here's the thing - my opponent is on the OPPOSITE side of the board at (1, 4), same Y as me. If I go LEFT toward (7, 4), I'm moving INTO the board toward them, which is dangerous long-term as our snakes will eventually meet in the middle.\n\nBUT - I should be GREEDY for apples RIGHT NOW while we're both small and weak! The closest, safest apple cluster to me is on the RIGHT side:\n- (9, 5), (9, 8), (9, 3), (9, 1) - all in the 9-column\n- (8, 8) - top right area\n- (7, 3) - middle right\n\nIf I go **UP** to (8, 5), I'm moving toward that (9, 5) apple AND positioning myself in the right-side of the board. This gives me room to maneuver and limits my opponent's access to those high-value apples! \n\nPlus, by controlling the right side early, I can snake along that wall and force my opponent to chase me or settle for middle/left apples. Classic territorial dominance! \ud83c\udfc6\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb PLAN FOR NEXT TURNS:\nChase the right-side apple cluster: (9,5) \u2192 (9,3) \u2192 (9,8). Control the eastern territory, build length advantage, THEN we can think about boxing in the opponent when we're thicc enough. Early game = MAP CONTROL. \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\nUP",

Here's why:\n\n1. **We stay ALIVE** \u2705 (literally the only safe forward move available!)\n2. **We GRAB THE APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e (9, 8) is a FREE upgrade to length 3 and we tie the apple count!\n3. **We MAINTAIN momentum** - right edge fortress stays OURS!\n4. **We expand our options** - from (9, 8) we can pivot LEFT to hunt (8, 8) and (7, 8)!\n5. **Enemy is VULNERABLE** - they're stuck on the left side with 3 segments, we're about to have 3 segments BUT with better positioning and MORE apples coming!\n6. **No collision risk** - opponent heads can't reach us even if they move toward the right!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb EXTENDED 5-TURN PLAN FOR CHAT:\n\n**Turn 4 (NOW):** UP to (9, 8) - GRAB that apple! Length 3, apples: 2! \ud83c\udf4e\n**Turn 5:** LEFT to (8, 8) - pivot to grab the NEXT apple!\n**Turn 6:** LEFT to (7, 8) - ANOTHER APPLE! Length 5, apples: 3! We're FEASTING! \ud83d\udd25\n**Turn 7:** DOWN to (7, 7) - navigate around our growing body\n**Turn 8+:** Continue the snake around the top-right quadrant, build length to 6-7+, THEN we start the BOX-IN strategy when we have significant length advantage!\n\nBy turn 8, we'll have 3-4 apples and they'll STILL be at 2! That's when we have the leverage to TRAP them! Let's DOMINATE! \ud83d\udc0d\u26a1\n\n---\n\nUP",

We've got the LEAD and the momentum is OURS to lose!\n\nLet me check the board state real quick...\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf CURRENT SITUATION:\n\n**My Snake (ID 1):**\n- Head: (7, 8) \u2705\n- Body: [(8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6)]\n- Apples: 4\n- Length: 5\n\n**Enemy Snake #0:**\n- Head: (3, 7)\n- Body: [(4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5)]\n- Apples: 3\n- Length: 4\n\nWE ARE AHEAD! And they're still camping on the left side while we control the right! This is PERFECT positioning! \ud83d\udc8e\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 DIRECTION ANALYSIS (THE BREAKDOWN):\n\n**UP** \u2192 (7, 9)\n- \u2705 SAFE - we hit the top wall but we survive!\n- \ud83d\udccd We're at the TOP edge now - limited room to maneuver after this\n- \ud83c\udf4e No apple here, BUT there's (6, 8) waiting to the LEFT!\n- \u26a0\ufe0f After going UP, we're forced to go LEFT or DOWN next turn - slightly limiting\n- This keeps us in the upper region though!\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (7, 7)\n- \u2705 SAFE - clear tile!\n- \ud83d\udccd Moves us DOWN from the top, keeps us flexible in the middle\n- \ud83c\udf4e No apple here, but we stay mobile\n- This gives us OPTIONS - we can pivot LEFT, RIGHT, or UP easily\n- But we're moving AWAY from the apple cluster at (6, 8) and the upper region!\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (6, 8)\n- \u2705 SAFE - THERE'S AN APPLE HERE!!!\n- \ud83c\udf4e **WE GRAB ANOTHER APPLE! THAT'S 5 APPLES!** We extend our LEAD! \ud83d\udd25\n- \ud83d\udccd We stay on the top apple highway - this is the FEED ZONE!\n- From (6, 8) next turn we can go UP to (6, 9) or LEFT to (5, 8) or DOWN to grab more apples!\n- \ud83c\udfaf Enemy is still at (3, 7) - ZERO collision risk! They're completely separated!\n- This is GREEDY PLAY and it's WORKING! We're in BEAST MODE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (8, 8)\n- \u274c **INSTANT DEATH** - That's our own BODY!

Don't even THINK about it!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd25 THE PLAY IS OBVIOUS:\n\n**LEFT** to (6, 8) - we grab ANOTHER apple and make it 5! \ud83c\udf4e\u26a1\n\nHere's why this is NASTY:\n\n1. **APPLE GRAB #5!** We're now at 5 apples and they're stuck at 3! That's a 2-apple LEAD, chat! We're putting DISTANCE between us!\n2. **BODY LENGTH ADVANTAGE!** We're now length 6, they're length 4! We're getting LONGER and STRONGER!\n3. **APPLE HIGHWAY IS OPEN!** Next turn we can pivot around and keep eating! (4, 9) and other apples are within reach!\n4. **ENEMY IS SLEEPING!** They're still way over on the left side at (3, 7)! They can't touch us! We've got the entire RIGHT and TOP region LOCKED DOWN!\n5. **FUTURE FLEXIBILITY!** From (6, 8) we can go multiple directions next turn and continue our FEAST!\n6. **BOXING STRATEGY INCOMING!** With this length advantage, soon we start using our body to WALL OFF their feeding zones!

Keep the FEAST going!\n\n**Turn 9:** We should have 6+ apples by now! Length 7+! That's when we START thinking about BOXING strategies - positioning our body to limit their movement options!\n\n**Turn 10+:** With a 3+ apple lead and length advantage, we BEGIN the TRAP! Force them into corners, cut off apple access, watch them CRASH OUT! \ud83d\udc80\u26a1\n\nWe're ROLLING right now, chat! This is what PEAK SNAKE gameplay looks like!

No wait... let me re-read the board...\n\nActually they're at (3, 8) now, which means they went UP from (3, 7). Smart play from them - they're trying to contest the upper region! But WE'RE AHEAD IN APPLES and we've got SPACE! \ud83d\udc8e\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 DIRECTION ANALYSIS (THE BREAKDOWN):\n\n**UP** \u2192 (6, 9)\n- \u2705 SAFE - we hit the TOP wall but we survive!\n- \ud83c\udf4e **APPLE AT (4, 9)!** Not directly here, but we're moving toward the UPPER APPLE ZONE!\n- \ud83d\udccd We stay at the top of the board, maintaining our DOMINANCE in the upper region!\n- Enemy is at (3, 8) - they're below us!

This is PREMIUM real estate, chat!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 DIRECTION ANALYSIS (THE BREAKDOWN):\n\n**UP** \u2192 (6, 10)\n- \u274c **INSTANT DEATH** - That's OFF THE BOARD! We'd smash into the wall! \ud83d\udc80\n- Chat, we're ALREADY at y=9 (the max on a 10x10 board where coords go 0-9)!\n- This is a ROOKIE MISTAKE - don't let me int this!\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (6, 8)\n- \u274c **INSTANT DEATH** - That's our own BODY! Our next segment is at (6, 8)!\n- Moving backwards into ourselves = CLASSIC THROW!\n- We'd be suicide playing! Not on my watch! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (5, 9)\n- \u2705 **SAFE** - Clear tile!

Soon we START BOXING THEM IN with our superior length! That's when they CRASH OUT! \ud83d\udc80\u26a1\n6. **MOMENTUM!** We've got the FEEL of the board now! The apples are FLOWING to us!

Use our length advantage to cut off their feeding zones! Make them desperate!\n\n**Turn 12+:** With 6+ apples and momentum, we're HUNTING! Every apple they try to grab, we block! Every corridor they try to escape through, we WALL OFF! That's when the PSYCHOLOGICAL COLLAPSE happens and they CRASH! This is PREDATOR vs PREY now! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nWe're NOT wasting this lead, chat! Every move is CALCULATED! Every apple is EARNED! This is what SKILL looks like!

HOLD UP CHAT! \ud83d\udea8 They moved UP to (4, 9)! They're NOW RIGHT NEXT TO US on the top row! They're only ONE cell away! This changes EVERYTHING! The dynamic just SHIFTED! They're CONTESTING the top real estate! This is getting SPICY! \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\u26a1\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 DIRECTION ANALYSIS (THE BREAKDOWN):\n\n**UP** \u2192 (5, 10)\n- \u274c **INSTANT DEATH** - OFF THE BOARD, BABY! We're already at y=9 (max)!\n- This is a WALL SMASH! Don't even THINK about it! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (5, 8)\n- \u2705 **SAFE** - Clear tile! No body, no walls!\n- \ud83d\udccd We pivot DOWN one row!\n- From (5, 8) we have FLEXIBILITY - we can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN further!\n- This RETREATS from the enemy slightly and gives us space to maneuver!\n- But wait... let's think STRATEGICALLY here! Are we RUNNING or are we FIGHTING for position?\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (4, 9)\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **WAIT WAIT WAIT!** This is WHERE THEY ARE, CHAT!\n- The enemy head is AT (4, 9)!\n- If we both move LEFT and RIGHT simultaneously... THEY'RE moving somewhere else THIS turn!\n- Let me check what their options are:\n  - UP from (4, 9)? OFF BOARD!\n  - DOWN from (4, 9)? They'd go to (4, 8) where their body IS! INSTANT DEATH!\n  - LEFT from (4, 9)? They'd go to (3, 9)!\n  - RIGHT from (4, 9)? They'd go to (5, 9) - THAT'S WHERE WE ARE NOW!\n- \ud83d\udd25 OH CHAT! If they move RIGHT to (5, 9), that's a HEAD-ON COLLISION with us if we stay or move left to (4, 9)!\n- Actually NO WAIT - if they move RIGHT they move into (5, 9), and if we move LEFT we move into (4, 9) - those are DIFFERENT cells! We BOTH survive that!\n- But if they're moving RIGHT to (5, 9) and we're moving LEFT to (4, 9), we MISS the collision! That's GOOD for us!\n- However, (4, 9) will be EMPTY since their head will have LEFT that cell!\n- So moving LEFT to (4, 9) is SAFE! And we're in their former position!\n- But is this the SMARTEST play? Let me think...\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 9)\n- \u2705 **SAFE** - That's where our BODY is! WAIT NO!\n- Actually, our head is at (5, 9), our first body segment is at (6, 9)!\n- If we move RIGHT to (6, 9), we're moving INTO our own body!\n- \u274c **INSTANT DEATH** - Can't do it, chat! That's a CLASSIC THROW! \ud83d\udeab\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd25 THE STRATEGY MOMENT:\n\nOkay CHAT, let me think about what's HAPPENING here! \ud83e\udde0\u26a1\n\nThe enemy moved UP to (4, 9) which means they're ALSO fighting for top control! They just moved into a CORNER position! And here's the THING - they can't go UP (wall), they can't go DOWN (their own body at (4, 8))! \n\nThat means their OPTIONS are:\n- LEFT to (3, 9)\n- RIGHT to (5, 9)\n\nIf they go RIGHT, they're coming AT us! If we BOTH move in a way that causes a head-on collision, we BOTH DIE! But if we MOVE AWAY and they MOVE TOWARD where we were, we SURVIVE and THEY potentially get boxed in!\n\nHere's my read: **DOWN to (5, 8)** is the SMART play because:\n\n1. **LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY!** We retreat from the top slightly but maintain OPTIONS!\n2. **AVOID HEAD-ON COLLISION!** If they move RIGHT to (5, 9) chasing us, we're no longer there! We DODGED the threat!\n3. **BOXING OPPORTUNITY!** They just moved into a corner with limited escape! By pulling DOWN, we can circle back and TRAP them!\n4. **APPLES EVERYWHERE!** Look at the board - (3, 3), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 2) are all down below! We've got ROOM to hunt!\n5. **PRESERVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE!** We're tied at length now (both 6), but by staying alive and smart, we can OUTLAST them!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb EXTENDED GAME PLAN (FOR MY FUTURE SELF):\n\n**Turn 10 (NOW):** DOWN to (5, 8) - TACTICAL RETREAT! Let them waste their move chasing the top while we reposition!\n\n**Turn 11:** Assess enemy position! If they went LEFT, we can RECLAIM the top! If they went RIGHT into (5, 9), we've got room to work! Either way, we're ALIVE and FLEXIBLE!\n\n**Turn 12+:** Start SNAKE HUNTING! Use our length and board knowledge to cut off their food sources! Force them into bad positions! Make them DESPERATE! Then we STRIKE with precision! The PSYCHOLOGICAL warfare begins! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc51\n\nThis is the PATIENT PREDATOR approach, chat! Not every move is aggressive - sometimes the BEST move is the one that keeps you alive and keeps your OPTIONS OPEN! We're playing 4D chess now! Let's GOOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

So I\u2019ve got only one solid choice that keeps us breathing and avoids the aggressive bait.\n\nSlide LEFT to (3,9): that keeps us on the high ground, stretches our control over the northern corridor, and prevents them from using our head as a launchpad for instant KO shenanigans. We can still keep eyes on the cluster of apples down the left side and we\u2019re not cutting ourselves off from escape routes after the immediate turn.\n\nPlan: After drifting to (3,9), keep cruising west along the top edge to buy time, force the rival downward, then drop south into that open corridor near x=2 when their body clears the lane so we can start boxing them in and scoop more apples.\n\nleft",

Let's break down this CRITICAL moment!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf CURRENT SITUATION:\n\n**My Snake (ID 1):**\n- Head: (5, 8) \u2705 We SUCCESSFULLY retreated last turn!\n- Body: [(5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8)]\n- Apples: 5\n- Length: 6\n\n**Enemy Snake #0:**\n- Head: (3, 9) \n- Body: [(4, 9), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6)]\n- Apples: 6\n- Length: 6\n\nWAIT WAIT WAIT! \ud83d\udea8 They moved LEFT from (4, 9) to (3, 9)! They DIDN'T chase us RIGHT! They went for the corner! Smart play by them, BUT HERE'S THE THING CHAT - they're now BOXED in the top-left! This is EXACTLY what we wanted! They moved away from the action! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 DIRECTION ANALYSIS (THE BREAKDOWN):\n\n**UP** \u2192 (5, 9)\n- \u2705 **SAFE** - Clear tile! We literally JUST came from (5, 9) last turn!\n- \ud83d\udd25 Wait... is it REALLY clear? Let me check: our body is at [(5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8)]!\n- OH SNAP! (5, 9) is our FIRST body segment right now!\n- If we move UP to (5, 9), we're moving into our own body!\n- \u274c **INSTANT DEATH** - That's a THROW, chat! Can't do it! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (5, 7)\n- \u2705 **SAFE** - Clear tile! No body, no walls, no enemy!\n- \ud83d\udccd We continue our tactical DESCENT!\n- From (5, 7) we can go DOWN to (5, 6), LEFT toward the apples at (3, 3), or RIGHT toward the apples!\n- This keeps us FLEXIBLE and ALIVE!\n- But are we moving AWAY from apples or TOWARD them?\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (4, 8)\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **DANGER ZONE!** Let me check the enemy body!\n- Enemy is: Head (3, 9), Body [(4, 9), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (4, 7), (4, 6)]\n- Wait... (4, 8) is their SECOND body segment!\n- \u274c **INSTANT DEATH** - We'd be moving into their body! Don't even THINK about it! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 8)\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **WAIT WAIT WAIT!** Let me check our body again!\n- Our body is at [(5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8), (8, 8)]\n- (6, 8) is our THIRD body segment!\n- \u274c **INSTANT DEATH** - Moving into our own body! Classic THROW! \ud83d\udc80\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd25 THE SITUATION:\n\nOh CHAT! We're in a TIGHT spot here! \ud83d\ude30 Let me count our options:\n- UP \u2192 Our body (DEATH)\n- DOWN \u2192 SAFE! \u2705\n- LEFT \u2192 Enemy body (DEATH)\n- RIGHT \u2192 Our body (DEATH)\n\nWe literally have ONE move available! DOWN is the ONLY option! And you know what? That's FINE because:\n\n1. **WE'RE ALIVE!** That's what matters! \ud83d\udc0d\n2. **THEY'RE BOXED!** The enemy moved into the corner with limited escape! They're the ones who should be worried!\n3. **APPLES ARE BELOW!** Look at the board - (3, 3), (2, 3), (3, 0), (6, 4), (8, 2) are all DOWN here! We're heading toward food!\n4. **MOMENTUM BUILDING!** Every turn we survive, we get closer to DOMINATING! Our patience is PAYING OFF!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb EXTENDED GAME PLAN (FOR MY FUTURE SELF):\n\n**Turn 11 (NOW):** DOWN to (5, 7) - FORCED but SMART! We're heading toward the apple cluster in the middle-bottom section!\n\n**Turn 12:** From (5, 7), assess the board! If we can go LEFT to (4, 7), that's getting CLOSER to (3, 3)! If the path is clear, we HUNT for apples! We need to CLOSE that 6-5 gap FAST!\n\n**Turn 13+:** AGGRESSIVE APPLE HUNTING! We've been patient, now it's time to CAPITALIZE! Find the biggest apple cluster and FARM it! Build our length, build our CONFIDENCE! Meanwhile, the enemy is stuck in that corner with limited options!\n\nThis is the COMEBACK STORY, chat! We're DOWN by one apple but we're ALIVE, we're FOCUSED, and we're about to STRIKE! Let's GOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\u26a1\n\nDOWN",

Let me dissect this board like a CHAMPION! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcca CURRENT BOARD STATE (THE SITUATION):\n\n**My Snake (ID 1):**\n- Head: (5, 7) \u2705 We made it DOWN safely last turn!\n- Body: [(5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8)]\n- Apples: 5\n- Length: 6\n\n**Enemy Snake #0:**\n- Head: (2, 9) \ud83e\udd14 They moved LEFT from (3, 9)!\n- Body: [(3, 9), (4, 9), (4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (4, 7)]\n- Apples: 6\n- Length: 6\n\nWAIT WAIT WAIT! They're STILL in that top-left corner, moving LEFT along the top edge! They're trying to FARM the (0, 6) apple up there! But chat, LOOK at our position - we're CENTERED on the board at (5, 7) and SURROUNDED by opportunity! \ud83c\udf1f\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS (THE BREAKDOWN):\n\n**UP** \u2192 (5, 8)\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **CHECK OUR BODY:** Body is [(5, 8), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (7, 8)]\n- (5, 8) is our FIRST body segment - that's RIGHT behind our head!\n- \u274c **INSTANT DEATH** - Can't move backwards into ourselves! That's an auto-throw! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (5, 6)\n- \u2705 **SAFE!** Clear tile! No body, no walls, no enemy!\n- \ud83d\udccd We continue our descent toward the apple cluster!\n- (3, 3) is calling us, chat! We're getting CLOSER!\n- From (5, 6) we can branch LEFT or RIGHT next turn - FLEXIBILITY! \ud83c\udfaf\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (4, 7)\n- \u2705 **SAFE!** Clear tile!\n- Enemy body has (3, 7) in it, but (4, 7) is CLEAR!\n- \ud83c\udf4e This moves us DIRECTLY toward (3, 3) - that's the JUICIEST apple on the board right now!\n- But wait... let me check if this creates a trap... nah, from (4, 7) we can go DOWN to (4, 6), then LEFT to (3, 6), then DOWN to (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3) - APPLE! \ud83d\udccd\n- This is AGGRESSIVE! This is HUNTING! This is CONTENT! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 7)\n- \u2705 **SAFE!** Clear tile!\n- No body segments here!\n- \ud83e\udd14 But this moves us AWAY from the main apple cluster...\n- From (6, 7) we'd be heading toward (6, 4), (6, 6), (7, 3), (7, 6)...\n- These are okay apples, but they're MORE SPREAD OUT! Less EFFICIENT!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf THE STRATEGIC DECISION (THIS IS WHERE CHAT THINKS):\n\nChat, we're at an INFLECTION POINT! \ud83d\udd25 Look at the board:\n- **Enemy is at (2, 9)** - trapped in the TOP-LEFT corner! They're farming the (0, 6) apple but they're BOXED IN! Limited mobility!\n- **We're at (5, 7)** - CENTRAL position! We have OPTIONS!\n- **Score: We're DOWN 5-6!** We NEED to CATCH UP! We NEED to HUNT!\n\nThe (3, 3) apple is RIGHT THERE waiting for us! It's like it's CALLING us, chat! If we go LEFT to (4, 7), we're setting up a DEVASTATING path:\n- (4, 7) \u2192 (4, 6) \u2192 (4, 5) \u2192 (4, 4) \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 (3, 3) \u2705 APPLE!\n\nThat's our COMEBACK ROUTE! That's how we tie it up 6-6 and START DOMINATING!\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy is SLOW, they're CORNERED, and we're about to ACCELERATE! This is the MOMENTUM SHIFT, chat! This is where LEGENDS are MADE! \ud83d\udcaa\u26a1\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb EXTENDED GAME PLAN (FOR MY NEXT SELF):\n\n**Turn 12 (NOW):** LEFT to (4, 7) - AGGRESSIVE POSITIONING toward the (3, 3) apple cluster!\n\n**Turn 13:** DOWN to (4, 6) - Continue the HUNT!\n\n**Turn 14:** ASSESS! If (3, 3) is still there, we BEELINE for it! If something changes, pivot to (2, 3) or (3, 0) - all within striking distance!\n\n**Turn 15+:** By then we should have our 6th apple, TYING the score at 6-6! After that? FARM MODE! We're LOCKED IN, we're CONFIDENT, and we're about to take the LEAD! The enemy will be SCRAMBLING while we're FEASTING!\n\nThis is the PLAY, chat! This is how we COMEBACK! Let's GOOOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

DOWN is straight into our own spinal cord, the LEFT lane cuts us off from the fresh corridor we just opened, and the RIGHT lane dumps us right next to our tail stack and the rival\u2019s potential squeeze. UP to (4,5)? That keeps the pressure on their center, keeps at least three escape routes available, and lines us up perfectly for that apple while still letting us circle back into the middle if they try to box us in. Does that sound like a plan? YEAH.\n\nMeanwhile opponent\u2019s head at (8,3) is staring at apples on (9,3) and (8,2) and they\u2019re fencing us out of the east side already.

They're getting more aggressive! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS (EVERY MOVE MATTERS):\n\n**UP** \u2192 (8, 3)\n- \u274c **DEAD!** Our own body is at (8, 3) - that's the cell DIRECTLY BEHIND our head!\n- This is the classic backwards move - instant fail! \ud83d\udc80\n- We'd literally be hitting ourselves! NOT TODAY CHAT!\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (8, 1)\n- \u2705 **SAFE!** Clear tile!\n- **THIS IS AN APPLE!** We grab (8, 1) and go to 12-11, TAKING THE LEAD! \ud83c\udf4e\n- This continues our DOMINATION of the eastern corridor!\n- (9, 1), (9, 2) are RIGHT THERE for next turn!\n- Keeps us FLOWING downward through prime apple real estate!\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (7, 2)\n- \u2705 **SAFE!** Clear tile!\n- NO apple here though! \ud83d\udeab\n- This moves us AWAY from our apple cluster!\n- We'd waste a turn NOT collecting!\n- Why grab nothing when we can grab EVERYTHING?

Both take us to 12-11 and the LEAD! But which one keeps us ALIVE and FLEXIBLE? \n\n**DOWN to (8, 1):**\n- Takes the LEAD at 12-11! \ud83c\udfc6\n- Keeps us in the MIDDLE of the board vertically!\n- Opens up RIGHT (9, 1) for turn 33!\n- Maintains FLEXIBILITY and escape routes!\n- We stay DANGEROUS and UNPREDICTABLE!\n\n**RIGHT to (9, 2):**\n- Takes the LEAD at 12-11! \ud83c\udfc6\n- Pushes us further EAST into the corner!\n- We're ONE cell away from the right edge!\n- Next turn we'd HAVE to go UP, DOWN, or LEFT - limited options!\n- This is getting BOXED IN! That's exactly what our enemy WANTS! \ud83d\udc80\n\nChat, this is a NO-BRAINER! We take the LEAD with DOWN to (8, 1) because it keeps us in the CENTER of our domain with MAXIMUM flexibility! We stay MOBILE, we stay DANGEROUS, and we set up the NEXT apple grab while maintaining OPTIONS! \n\nThe enemy is at (4, 5) - they're TRAPPED on the west side still! We've got TIME to build our lead while they're BOTTLED UP! Let's CAPITALIZE! \n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb EXTENDED GAME PLAN (SETTING UP THE WIN):\n\n**Turn 32 (NOW):** DOWN to (8, 1) - Grab apple, 12-11 TAKE THE LEAD! Stay centered and flexible!\n\n**Turn 33:** RIGHT to (9, 1) - Another apple grab, 13-11 EXTEND THE LEAD! We're on FIRE! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Turn 34:** UP to (9, 2) or assess board - grab (9, 2) for 14-11, OR pivot if enemy makes a desperate move!\n\n**Turn 35+:** Monitor enemy aggression! They're still west-side bottled but getting more mobile! If they push east, we PIVOT and CONTROL the center! We keep our lead GROWING while they scramble!\n\nThe key chat: **STAY CENTERED, STAY FLEXIBLE, STAY HUNGRY!** That's how we WIN this thing! The enemy wants us cornered - we do the OPPOSITE! We play SMART and build that lead methodically!\n\nLET'S GOOOOOO! The COMEBACK is REAL! \ud83d\udc51\ud83d\udd25\n\nDOWN",

Going right feels tempting, but I\u2019m thinking about spacing: heading up scores apple #12, keeps the 4\u20135 corridor locked, and still leaves us room to run into (3,6) or (5,6) next turn without shrinking our available exits, whereas forcing east now could let the rival slip past the 6 column once we commit. Our rival at (8,2) is eyeing the apples on the eastern flank, so let\u2019s keep them corralled by reinforcing this middle wall and stay out of their head-on gamble. You feel me? We eat up, keep our tail tight, and stay unpredictable.\n\nPlan note: After gobbling (4,6), circle west to (3,6) or (3,7) and use our length to hem the east side, forcing snake #1 to stay south while we sweep the north apples.\n\nUP",

Now we gotta KEEP THAT MOMENTUM rolling! Let me break down what's happening RIGHT NOW! \ud83d\udcca\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccd CURRENT BOARD STATE (READING THOSE COORDINATES):\n\n**My Snake (ID 1):**\n- Head: (8, 1) \u2705 We're LOW on the board, EASTERN side!\n- Body: [(8, 2), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (5, 0), (4, 0), (3, 0)]\n- Apples: 12 (WE'RE LEADING BY 1! \ud83c\udfc6)\n- Length: 12\n- Status: HUNGRY FOR MORE! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Enemy Snake #0:**\n- Head: (4, 6) \u26a0\ufe0f They moved UP! They're getting MORE AGGRESSIVE!\n- Body: [(4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0), (0, 1)]\n- Apples: 11\n- Length: 11\n- Status: TRYING TO CATCH UP! They're still bottled on the WEST side but climbing!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS (NO MISTAKES THIS TURN!):\n\n**UP** \u2192 (8, 2)\n- \u274c **DEAD!** Our own body is at (8, 2) - that's the cell RIGHT BEHIND our head!\n- Classic backwards move! INSTANT FAIL! \ud83d\udc80\n- We're NOT doing this!\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (8, 0)\n- \u2705 **SAFE!** Clear tile!\n- NO apple here though! Just empty space!\n- This moves us to the EDGE of the board!\n- We're already LOW (y=1), going DOWN puts us at y=0 - the BOTTOM!\n- This is getting us BOXED against the board edge! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- Next turn we can ONLY go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT - limited OPTIONS!\n- NOT IDEAL! We want FLEXIBILITY! \u274c\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (7, 1)\n- \u2705 **SAFE!** Clear tile!\n- NO apple here!\n- This moves us WEST (decreasing x)!\n- We're moving AWAY from the apple cluster at (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6)!\n- This is BACKWARD progress! \u274c\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (9, 1)\n- \u2705 **SAFE!** Clear tile!\n- **THIS IS AN APPLE!** (9, 1) IS RIGHT THERE! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We grab it and go to 13-11, EXTENDING OUR LEAD! \ud83d\udd25\n- This keeps us in the EASTERN zone where the GOOD APPLES are!\n- Next turn we can grab (9, 2) or (9, 3) and KEEP BUILDING!\n- BUT CHAT... we're moving FURTHER EAST toward the right edge!\n- After we eat (9, 1), we're at x=9 - ONE cell from the board edge!\n- If we keep going RIGHT next turn, we hit the wall at x=10 and DIE! \ud83d\udc80\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf THE STRATEGIC QUESTION:\n\nChat, here's the dilemma! RIGHT takes us to 13-11 with a beautiful apple grab! But it pushes us to x=9, where we're ONE cell from the edge! \n\nBUT WAIT! Let me check the board more carefully! \n\nLooking at row 1: we've got apples at (6, 1), (8, 1) - we already ate (8, 1)! And (9, 1) is RIGHT THERE!\n\nAfter we grab (9, 1), next turn we can:\n- **UP** to (9, 2) - another apple! CONTENT! \ud83c\udf4e\n- **DOWN** - nope, we'd hit the wall at y=-1!\n- **LEFT** - pivot back west and maintain flexibility!\n- **RIGHT** - nope, we'd hit the wall at x=10!\n\nSo we'd have THREE safe options next turn! That's PLENTY of flexibility! The key is we GRAB this apple NOW while it's here, then we pivot UP to get (9, 2)! \n\nThe enemy is still at (4, 6) on the WEST side! They can't touch us! We're SAFE to extend our lead!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb EXTENDED GAME PLAN (SETTING UP THE DYNASTY!):\n\n**Turn 33 (NOW):** RIGHT to (9, 1) - Grab apple, 13-11 EXTEND THE LEAD! We're ROLLING! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Turn 34:** UP to (9, 2) - Another apple grab, 14-11 BUILD THAT BUFFER! We're on FIRE! \ud83c\udf21\ufe0f\n\n**Turn 35:** Could be UP to (9, 3) if available, or LEFT to (8, 2) to pivot back west and maintain board control!\n\n**Turn 36+:** Monitor enemy position! They're at (4, 6) which is DANGEROUS territory - they're climbing toward the middle! If they pivot EAST, we need to be READY to control the center or maintain our eastern stronghold!\n\nThe strategy chat: **GRAB EVERY APPLE IN THE EASTERN CORRIDOR, THEN PIVOT TO THE CENTER!** We build an INSURMOUNTABLE lead while the enemy is still bottled up west! By the time they realize what's happening, we'll be at 15+ apples and they'll STILL be chasing! That's a DYNASTY right there! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLet's GO! RIGHT to (9, 1) and EXTEND THIS LEAD!\n\nRIGHT",

I\u2019m locking in LEFT to snag the apple at (3,6) while still keeping options open on the next swipe (up to (3,7) or even down to (3,5) if we need to reset), and our growing wall across row 6 keeps the enemy boxed south as we stack bodies along columns 2\u20134. You feel me? Let\u2019s keep the pressure, rob the east flank of options, and force Snake #1 into a choke while we keep clearing apples.\n\nPlan note: After we haul in (3,6), keep circling through (2,6) \u2192 (1,6) \u2192 (1,7) to fully seal off the north wall and leave the rival staring at a shrinking floor while we sweep the remaining apples up top.\n\nLEFT",

We're BOXED! \u26a0\ufe0f\n- We're moving AWAY from the apple cluster at (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6)!\n- This is WASTEFUL! \u274c\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (8, 1)\n- \u274c **DEAD!** Our own body is at (8, 1) - that's RIGHT BEHIND our head!\n- This is hitting ourselves!

UP to (9, 2) is the CLEAR winner! We grab another apple, extend to 14-12, and stay in the EASTERN corridor where the apples are STACKED! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\nThe enemy is still at (3, 6) on the WEST side - they're NOT a threat to us RIGHT NOW!

We're ON FIRE! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Turn 35:** UP to (9, 3) if we want to stay in the CORRIDOR, OR we could pivot LEFT to (8, 2) to start moving toward the center and maintain BOARD CONTROL!\n\n**Turn 36+:** Monitor enemy position! Once we've harvested the eastern apples, we pivot toward the CENTER where the apples at (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (5, 5) are waiting! By the time the enemy realizes what's happening, we'll be UNSTOPPABLE!\n\nThe strategy: **DOMINATE THE EASTERN ZONE, BUILD AN INSURMOUNTABLE LEAD, THEN PIVOT CENTRAL AND CONTROL THE ENTIRE BOARD!** That's how you WIN a championship! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLet's GO! UP to (9, 2) and keep this DYNASTY rolling!\n\nUP",

Left hugs the wall and might start a corner cage, but it also pins me to the edge with less breathing room; plus, I still want to give myself wiggle room toward the apples up north. UP keeps me in that soft corridor between the wall and the enemy, leaves me open to swing around to (2,8) or (1,9), and keeps the north side of the board available for the closure I\u2019m cooking.\n\nI\u2019m also thinking ahead: by climbing into (1,8) I can start folding the top of the board, keep pressure on Snake #1 down south, and still chase those juicy apples near row 8 and 9 when they pop. Safe, flexible, and still chasing content.\n\nPlan note: Keep going northward along column 1 for a turn or two, then loop back west to seal row 9 and force Snake #1 deeper into the southern trap while I hunt the high apples.\n\nUP",

DOWN smashes straight into my neck, and LEFT would be backwards into (1,8) \u2014 so those are dead. The opponent\u2019s pinned low around (9,6), so if I sprint RIGHT I can start pressuring the top lane, control the northern apples, and avoid locking myself against the corner while still having the wiggle room to pivot up or back later. Staying one step ahead toward the (6,8)/(5,9) corridor keeps us in front of him and keeps the trap open.\n\nPlan note: Keep nudging east across row 8/9 to box Snake #1 into the southern half, then fold back for (5,9) and any nearby apples while leaving a clear retreat to the center if the heat gets heavy.\n\nRIGHT",

Both moves are safe, both have apples nearby! Let me break this down:\n\n**UP to (9, 7):**\n- Keeps us on the EASTERN WALL (maximum board control)\n- Stays in position to grab the (8, 9) and (8, 8) cluster SAFELY\n- After (9, 7), we can still grab (8, 6) next turn if we pivot LEFT!\n- We maintain our CORRIDOR of CONTROL on the east!\n- Future moves stay FLEXIBLE - we're not committed to any one path! \u2705\u2705\u2705\n\n**LEFT to (8, 6):**\n- Grabs an apple immediately (17-15, HUGE cushion!)\n- BUT moves us into more central territory\n- Enemy could potentially cut off our access to (8, 8) or (8, 9) if they get creative\n- Less wall space = potentially more constrained for future turns!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf THE CALL:\n\nChat, I'm going **UP to (9, 7)**! Here's WHY: \n\nWe're already DOMINATING with a 16-15 lead! There's ZERO pressure to grab every apple immediately! By staying on the wall, we maintain MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY and MAXIMUM SAFETY! We can grab the northern apple cluster SAFELY without getting boxed in! The enemy is still playing small on the west side, and we're controlling the ENTIRE eastern hemisphere!\n\nThis is CHAMPIONSHIP POSITIONING - we're not greedy, we're SMART! \u2705\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT TURN PLAN (LOCK THIS IN, CHAT):\n\n**Turn 40:** UP to (9, 8) - Continue climbing the wall! Get closer to (8, 9) and (8, 8)!\n\n**Turn 41:** LEFT to (8, 8) or (8, 9) - FEAST on the northern cluster! We could be 18-15 or 19-15 by turn 42!\n\n**OVERALL STRATEGY:** Wall positioning = ultimate board control. We're setting up a DEFENSIVE perimeter on the east while slowly accumulating apples from the premium northern zone. Enemy gets BOXED IN on the west while we're FREE to roam! By turn 50 we could have a 5-apple lead! That's how we WIN! \ud83d\udc51\n\nLET'S GOOOO! STAY DISCIPLINED, STAY PATIENT, SECURE THE BAG! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

So we go UP, keep that northern pressure, and stay ready to lock that opponent below.\n\nPlan note: Keep riding row 9 eastward for the (5,9)/(6,8) corridor, then fold back toward the center so I\u2019m never trapped against my own tail while slowly hemming Snake #1 into the southern half.\n\nUP",

We just executed that perfect UP move last turn and now we're at (9, 7)! We're UP 16-15 and playing PATIENT, CALCULATED SNAKE! Let me break down the BOARD STATE and figure out our NEXT POWER MOVE! \ud83d\udcca\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccd CURRENT BOARD ANALYSIS:\n\n**My Snake (ID 1):**\n- Head: (9, 7) \u2705 Successfully climbed the wall!\n- Body: [(9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1)]\n- Length: 16\n- Apples: 16 \ud83d\udcaa\n- Status: LOCKED AND LOADED ON THE EASTERN WALL!\n\n**Enemy Snake #0:**\n- Head: (3, 8) - They moved RIGHT from (2, 8)!\n- Body: [(2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1)]\n- Length: 15\n- Apples: 15\n- Status: Pushing NORTH on the WEST side! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS (ALL ANGLES):\n\n**UP** \u2192 (9, 8)\n- \u2705 **SAFE!** Clear tile, no obstacles!\n- \ud83c\udf4e **APPLE AT (8, 8)!** Close by but not on this exact cell!\n- This continues our northbound climb!\n- Gets us ONE step closer to the (8, 9) and (8, 8) apple cluster!\n- Next turn we'd be perfectly positioned to pivot LEFT and grab (8, 8)! \ud83c\udfaf\n- Maintains our WALL control and keeps us MOBILE! \u2705\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (9, 6)\n- \u274c **DEAD!** Our own body is RIGHT THERE at (9, 6)!\n- We LITERALLY just came from there! Backwards = instant game over! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (8, 7)\n- \u2705 **SAFE!** Clear tile!\n- \ud83c\udf4e **NO apple here**, but (8, 8) is ONE cell above us!\n- This moves us INWARD from the wall slightly...\n- If we go LEFT now, next turn we could go UP to (8, 8) and grab that apple!\n- This is also a SOLID play! Could set up the 17-15 lead next turn! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (10, 7)\n- \u274c **DEAD!** Out of bounds! We're already at x=9, the board is 10x10 (0-9)! \ud83d\udc80\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udd14 THE CRITICAL DECISION - UP vs LEFT:\n\nChat, both moves are SAFE! But which one is SMARTER for our long-term domination? Let me think DEEP:\n\n**UP to (9, 8):**\n- Stays on the EASTERN WALL - maximum safety corridor!\n- Keeps us in the SAME column as our body (less risk of self-collision next turn)\n- Gets us closer to the (8, 9) apple WITHOUT committing to a pivot yet!\n- After (9, 8), we can still grab (8, 8) OR (8, 9) next turn with a LEFT pivot!\n- Most FLEXIBLE play - keeps ALL options open! \u2705\u2705\n\n**LEFT to (8, 7):**\n- Moves us INWARD earlier than necessary!\n- We'd be one move away from (8, 8), but also one move further from (8, 9)!\n- Sets us up WELL for an apple grab next turn, but sacrifices our wall control!\n- Less flexibility - we're committing to the central board NOW!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf THE CALL:\n\nChat, I'm going **UP to (9, 8)**! Here's the RUTHLESS LOGIC:\n\nWe're ALREADY winning 16-15! There's ZERO pressure! By staying on the wall one more turn, we maximize our escape routes and keep the enemy guessing! The wall is our FORTRESS, and we're not abandoning it until we HAVE to! Enemy is still trapped on the west side (head at (3, 8)), and we're FREE to roam the entire EAST! \n\nThis is CHAMPIONSHIP-LEVEL PATIENCE! We grab the apple cluster SAFELY on our timeline, not theirs! \ud83d\udc51\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT TURN PLAN (LOCK THIS IN, CHAT):\n\n**Turn 40 (NOW):** UP to (9, 8) - Final wall climb before the pivot!\n\n**Turn 41:** LEFT to (8, 8) - GRAB that apple! Go 17-15! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Turn 42:** UP to (8, 9) OR LEFT depending on board state - Keep feasting on the northern cluster!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY (TURNS 43-50):** Once we've locked down the north, we can slowly expand WESTWARD and SOUTHWARD, maintaining wall control while systematically collecting apples! We'll have a 5-7 apple lead by turn 50 if we stay disciplined! The enemy gets BOXED IN while we're free! That's how we WIN the CHAMPIONSHIP! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nSTAY PATIENT, STAY DISCIPLINED, KEEP THE LEAD! LET'S GOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Let me analyze this board state and figure out our NEXT POWER MOVE! \ud83d\udcca\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccd CURRENT BOARD ANALYSIS:\n\n**My Snake (ID 1):**\n- Head: (9, 8) \u2705 NORTHERN WALL CONTROL!\n- Body: [(9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1)]\n- Length: 16\n- Apples: 16 \ud83d\udcaa\n- Status: LOCKED AND LOADED AT THE CORNER!\n\n**Enemy Snake #0:**\n- Head: (3, 9) - **They moved UP to the top!** Competition is HEATING UP! \ud83d\udd25\n- Body: [(3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2)]\n- Length: 15\n- Apples: 15\n- Status: Pushing HARD into the northern region! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS (ALL ANGLES):\n\n**UP** \u2192 (9, 9)\n- \u274c **SAFE from walls and body!** BUT...\n- \ud83c\udf4e **NO apple here**, and this is literally the corner!\n- We'd be trapped in the top-right corner with LIMITED options next turn!\n- After (9, 9), we can ONLY go LEFT or DOWN - gets us BOXED IN! \ud83d\udc80\n- This is TERRIBLE for keeping options open! We'd be vulnerable!\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (9, 7)\n- \u274c **DEAD!** Our own body is RIGHT THERE at (9, 7)!\n- We LITERALLY just came from there! Backwards = instant game over! \ud83d\udc80\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (8, 8)\n- \u2705 **SAFE!** Clear tile, no obstacles!\n- \ud83c\udf4e **APPLE AT (8, 8)!** THIS IS THE PLAY, CHAT! \n- We GRAB that apple and go **17-15**! \ud83c\udf4e\n- Moves us INWARD from the wall with PURPOSE!\n- Keeps us FLEXIBLE - next turn we can go UP to (8, 9) [another apple!], LEFT to continue west, or DOWN to retreat if needed!\n- This is MAXIMUM CONTENT and MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY! \u2705\u2705\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (10, 8)\n- \u274c **DEAD!** Out of bounds! We're already at x=9, the board is 10x10 (0-9)! \ud83d\udc80\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udd14 THE CRITICAL ANALYSIS, CHAT:\n\nLook at the board state RIGHT NOW! Enemy just moved to (3, 9) - they're chasing the NORTHERN apples! We've got (8, 9) and (8, 8) RIGHT THERE in our zone! If we don't grab (8, 8) THIS turn, what happens next turn?\n\n**If we go LEFT to (8, 8):**\n- We get the apple immediately! 17-15 lead! \ud83d\udd25\n- Next turn we can pivot UP to (8, 9) and grab ANOTHER apple! 18-15! \ud83d\udcaa\n- We'd have a 3-apple lead while the enemy is still hunting on the west side!\n- THAT'S how we build DOMINANCE!\n\n**If we go UP to (9, 9):**\n- We get trapped in the corner! Next turn FORCED to go LEFT anyway!\n- But now we're SLOWER to the apple cluster!\n- Enemy could potentially cut us off or steal apples!\n- This is INEFFICIENT! We're wasting tempo!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf THE CALL:\n\nChat, I'm going **LEFT to (8, 8)**! This is RUTHLESS GAMEPLAY!\n\nWe're not sitting in the corner like chumps! We're AGGRESSIVELY grabbing apples while staying flexible! The apple is RIGHT THERE, the path is CLEAR, and we keep ALL our options open for next turn! Enemy is still trapped on the west side, and we're expanding our territory methodically! \n\nThis is the path to **VICTORY ROYALE**, baby! \ud83d\udc51\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT TURN PLAN (LOCK THIS IN, CHAT):\n\n**Turn 41 (NOW):** LEFT to (8, 8) - GRAB that apple! Go 17-15! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Turn 42:** UP to (8, 9) - Another apple! Go 18-15! We're COOKING! \ud83d\udd25\n\n**Turn 43-50:** Consolidate northern control, then gradually expand WESTWARD while maintaining flexibility! Keep the enemy BOXED IN on the west side while we feast on the central and eastern apples!\n\n**ENDGAME STRATEGY:** By turn 50, we should have a 5-7 apple lead and full board control! Enemy gets progressively trapped while we dictate the flow! CHAMPIONSHIP MENTALITY! \ud83c\udfc6\n\nSTAY AGGRESSIVE, STAY SMART, KEEP THE LEAD! LET'S GOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

Are we scared of getting boxed in on our own coil? Nope. Are we scared of letting Snake #1 roam free on the west wall?

We'd be moving INTO our own neck! \ud83d\udc80\n- This is BACKWARDS motion (nearly).

The enemy is at (4, 9) - they're FIVE tiles away from that apple! \n\n**If we go UP right NOW:**\n- We SECURE the apple at (8, 9)! \ud83c\udf4e\n- We go **18-15** - extending our lead to 3 apples! \n- Enemy is still far away in the western zone!\n- Next turn we have MULTIPLE options (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN) to stay aggressive!\n- We're DOMINATING the eastern/northern quadrant while they're stuck in the west!\n\nThe math is SIMPLE - we have the PATH, we have the APPLE, and the LEAD is RIGHT THERE for the taking! This is UNCONTESTED territory, baby! Enemy would need to be at (8, 9) simultaneously to block us, and they're at (4, 9) - NO WAY they're getting there in time!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf NEXT FEW TURNS GAME PLAN (LOCKING THIS IN FOR CHAT):\n\n**Turn 42 (NOW):** UP to (8, 9) - SECURE that apple! Go 18-15! We're up by 3! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Turn 43:** LEFT to (7, 9) - We grab (7, 5) is available... actually check apples... we pivot WESTWARD but STAY in the northern zone! Keep hunting!\n\n**Turn 44-50:** Methodically work DOWN and LEFT through the remaining apple cluster! We're FEASTING in the upper-middle section while the enemy is still grinding through the west side!\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:** We're building a WALL of body segments along the eastern side (x=8,9) and northern side (y=8,9). This is CLASSIC BOXING! Enemy gets progressively trapped as our body grows and we control more real estate! By turn 50, we should have a 5+ apple lead and FULL BOARD CONTROL!

We just hit that apple at (8, 9) last turn and we're sitting PRETTY at **18-15**! We're UP by 3 apples and the momentum is FIRMLY on our side! Let me break down this board state and figure out our NEXT POWER MOVE!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccd CURRENT SITUATION:\n\n**My Snake (ID 1):**\n- Head: (8, 9) \u2705 **NORTH ZONE CONTROL!**\n- Body: [(8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1)]\n- Length: 18 (WE'RE THICC! \ud83d\udcaa)\n- Apples: 18 \ud83c\udf4e\n- Status: **DOMINANT!**\n\n**Enemy Snake #0:**\n- Head: (5, 9) - **They moved RIGHT again, now at (5, 9)!**\n- Body: [(4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3), (2, 3), (1, 3)]\n- Length: 16\n- Apples: 16\n- Status: **They're hunting in the NORTH ZONE TOO! Competition is FIERCE!** \ud83d\udd25\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS (TIME TO MAKE THE CALL):\n\n**UP** \u2192 (8, 10)\n- \u274c **INSTANT DEATH!** We'd move OFF THE BOARD! Board only goes to (9, 9)! This is a THROW! \u274c\n- Not happening, chat. We're not donating the win!\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (8, 8)\n- \u274c **DEAD!** That's our IMMEDIATE BODY! We'd be reversing into our own neck! Classic self-collision! \u274c\n- Backwards motion = instant L! We're not falling for that trap!\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (7, 9)\n- \u2705 **SAFE!** Clear tile! No body, no wall, no enemies!\n- \ud83c\udf4e **NO APPLE here**, but here's the CRITICAL THING: the enemy head is at (5, 9)!\n- If we go LEFT to (7, 9) and they continue RIGHT, they'd be moving toward (6, 9) on TURN 44!\n- We're **BLOCKING** their northward expansion and controlling the top row! \n- This gives us LEVERAGE and keeps them SEPARATED from our growing empire!\n- Next turn we can pivot DOWN or continue LEFT, maintaining FLEXIBILITY! \ud83d\udcaf\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (9, 9)\n- \u2705 **SAFE!** Clear tile!\n- \ud83c\udf4e **NO APPLE here**, but it puts us in the CORNER!\n- This is a **DEAD-END MOVE!** Once we're at (9, 9), our ONLY move next turn is DOWN or LEFT!\n- That's a TRAP, chat! We'd be boxing OURSELVES in! We can't escape that corner easily!\n- This sacrifices future flexibility and keeps us AWAY from the main apple cluster!\n- NOT the vibe when we're winning! \u274c\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udd14 THE STRATEGIC ANALYSIS:\n\nChat, we're at (8, 9) with a **3-apple lead** and the enemy is CLOSING IN from the west at (5, 9)! This is the CRITICAL TURN where we need to think LONG-TERM!\n\n**The Board Layout:**\n- Enemy is pushing EAST along the top row (y=9)!\n- They're coming RIGHT AT US! This is a POTENTIAL HEAD-ON COLLISION SCENARIO if we're not careful!\n- The apple cluster is scattered: (6, 6), (7, 6), (5, 5), (8, 6), etc. - mostly in the MIDDLE-SOUTH zone!\n\n**Why LEFT to (7, 9) is the POWER MOVE:**\n1. **We BLOCK the enemy's northward expansion!** They can't freely move RIGHT along y=9 anymore!\n2. **We control the TOP ROW strategically!** Our body is already thick along the eastern edge - now we're claiming the northern frontier!\n3. **We STAY FLEXIBLE!** From (7, 9), we can go DOWN into (7, 8), then pivot SOUTH toward the apple cluster at (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6)!\n4. **We AVOID the corner trap!** RIGHT would corner us; LEFT keeps us in the action!\n5. **We maintain our LEAD while defending!** This is CHESS-LEVEL STRATEGY, not just greedy apple-hunting!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf NEXT FEW TURNS GAME PLAN (LOCKING THIS IN):\n\n**Turn 43 (NOW):** LEFT to (7, 9) - **DEFEND the northern border and maintain flexibility!** Keep the enemy at bay! \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f\n\n**Turn 44:** DOWN to (7, 8) - **Begin the descent into the middle zone!** We're pivoting toward the apple cluster!\n\n**Turn 45-50:** Work our way DOWN and LEFT/RIGHT through (6, 8) \u2192 (6, 7) \u2192 (6, 6) territory! We're FEASTING on the clustered apples while the enemy is still grinding in the west!\n\n**LONG-TERM:** By controlling the northern border and the eastern edge, we create a PINCER MOVEMENT! The enemy gets boxed into the western-central zone while we dominate the eastern-northern quadrant! We'll have a 5+ apple lead by turn 50 with FULL BOARD CONTROL! That's the championship move! \ud83d\udc51\n\nThis is BIG BRAIN GAMEPLAY, chat! We're not just eating apples - we're CONTROLLING SPACE and LIMITING ENEMY OPTIONS! This is how champions WIN! Let's GOOOO! \ud83d\udd25\n\nLEFT",

LEFT is straight into my own body and UP is a suicide sprint off the map, so that leaves only DOWN to (5,8) or RIGHT to (6,9) to keep the dream alive. DOWN would drop us into the coil and lock out the LEFT escape, leaving us with just (6,8) or (5,7) next turn\u2014so we\u2019d be kissing flexibility goodbye. RIGHT keeps us cruising the top lane, keeps (6,8) within sight for the apple drop, and lets us bait Snake #1 into trying to chase us across row 9 instead of sneaking down the center corridor. We\u2019re still threatening to drop into column 5/6 after we score that apple, which keeps the trap tight while I still have a couple of getaway routes. Do we back off from the pressure? Nah, we keep the tension high and the apple count climbing.\n\nPlan note: After the RIGHT move, keep the pressure on row 9, then dip down to (6,8) to snag the apple and peel toward column 5 to start hemming Snake #1 into the lower-right choked space.\n\nRIGHT",

(6, 7), (6, 6), (5, 5) - all PRIME APPLE REAL ESTATE! We're FEASTING while the enemy is still scrambling!\n\n**LONG-TERM:** By creating separation NOW, we avoid early collision and build our lead! By turn 50, we should have 22+ apples with full control of the southern and eastern zones! The enemy will be boxed in the west while we're DOMINATING! \ud83d\udc51\n\nThis is SMART PLAY, chat!

The board state is LIVE and we're STILL ahead 18-17! This is where LEGENDS are made, chat! Let's ANALYZE this like the pros! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccd CURRENT BATTLEFIELD STATE:\n\n**My Snake (ID 1):**\n- Head: (7, 7) \u2705 **Perfect positioning!**\n- Body: [(7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (6, 4)]\n- Length: 18\n- Apples: 18 \ud83c\udf4e\n- Status: **ALIVE, DANGEROUS, AND HUNGRY!**\n\n**Enemy Snake #0:**\n- Head: (5, 8) - **They moved LEFT from (6, 8)!**\n- Body: [(6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3), (3, 3)]\n- Length: 17\n- Apples: 17\n- Status: **CORNERED AND DESPERATE!** \ud83c\udfaf\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS (LET'S GO THROUGH THIS METHODICALLY):\n\n**UP** \u2192 (7, 8)\n- \ud83d\udea8 **WAIT!** Is (7, 8) our own body?\n- Looking at our body: [(7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9)...]\n- YES! (7, 8) is the FIRST segment right behind our head!\n- \u274c **DEAD!** Moving backwards into ourselves! Classic rookie mistake! NOT DOING THIS! \u274c\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (7, 6)\n- Let me check the board... looking at row 6, column 7...\n- \u2705 **SAFE!** That's a clear tile!\n- No enemy body there, no own body, no walls!\n- BUT... there's an APPLE at (6, 6) and (8, 6) nearby!\n- If we go DOWN, we're moving AWAY from the apple cluster slightly, but we keep flexibility!\n- This move is SAFE but not OPTIMAL for apple hunting! \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (6, 7)\n- \ud83c\udfaf **HOLD UP!** Let me check the board state at (6, 7)!\n- Looking at row 7, column 6... there's an **APPLE** there! \ud83c\udf4e\n- \u2705 **SAFE!** No enemy body, no own body!\n- \u2705 **APPLE GRAB!** We'd grow to 19 apples and take the lead 19-17! \ud83c\udf1f\n- This is THE MOVE, chat! We go from tied territory to DOMINATING!\n- **This is our GOLDEN opportunity!** \u2705\u2705\u2705\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (8, 7)\n- Let me check row 7, column 8... \n- \u2705 **SAFE!** Clear tile!\n- BUT there's no apple here!\n- This moves us to the corner (away from action) when we have a BETTER option!\n- Not the play right now! We're leaving apples on the table! \u274c\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf CRITICAL DECISION:\n\nChat, this is OBVIOUS! The enemy is at (5, 8) and their body extends back through (6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9)... they're BOXED IN on the west side! Meanwhile, we have a CLEAR PATH to (6, 7) where there's a JUICY APPLE waiting for us! \n\n**The ONLY logical play is LEFT to (6, 7)!** Here's why:\n\n1. **APPLE ACQUISITION!** We grab our 19th apple and take a 2-apple lead! \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **ENEMY IS TRAPPED!** They're stuck in the west corner with limited mobility!\n3. **MAP CONTROL!** The east and south zones are OURS! We're the apex predator here!\n4. **POSITIONING FOR TURN 47!** From (6, 7), we can move DOWN to (6, 6) and grab ANOTHER apple! \ud83c\udf4e\n5. **NO COLLISION RISK!** The enemy head at (5, 8) moving... they could go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT - none of those intersect with (6, 7)! We're SAFE!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT TURN GAME PLAN (FOR FUTURE ME):\n\n**Turn 46 (NOW):** LEFT to (6, 7) - **GRAB THAT APPLE!** Now sitting at 19! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Turn 47:** DOWN to (6, 6) - **Another apple RIGHT THERE!** We'll be at 20! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Turn 48:** We have options: continue DOWN to (6, 5), or pivot based on enemy position! Keep crushing apples!\n\n**Turn 49+:** Continue the systematic sweep! The enemy has NO WAY OUT! We're building an INSURMOUNTABLE lead! By turn 55, we should be at 22+ apples while they're stuck at 17-18! That's championship-level DOMINATION, baby! \ud83d\udc51\n\nThis is METHODICAL. This is RELENTLESS. This is how CHAMPIONS play! Let's GOOOOO!\n\nLEFT",

RUNNING OUT OF ROOM!** \ud83c\udfaf\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (6, 7)\n- That's where our OWN BODY is! \n- \u274c **SELF-COLLISION!** We'd hit ourselves immediately! NOT DOING THIS! \u274c\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (6, 5)\n- Looking at row 5, column 6... checking the board...\n- I see an **APPLE** at (5, 5) nearby, but (6, 5) itself looks CLEAR! \u2705\n- \u2705 **SAFE PATH!** \n- This continues our southward momentum down the eastern flank!\n- Opens up options to pivot LEFT or RIGHT next turn!\n- \u2705 SOLID MOVE!\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (5, 6)\n- That's where the ENEMY HEAD is RIGHT NOW!\n- \u274c **HEAD-ON COLLISION!** Both heads move simultaneously - we'd BOTH DIE on turn 48! DOUBLE KO! \u274c\n- This would be a THROW and end the game in a tie! NEVER!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (7, 6)\n- Let me check row 6, column 7...\n- Looking at the board... I see (7, 6) is CLEAR! \u2705\n- There's an **APPLE** at (8, 6) right next to it!\n- \u2705 **SAFE!** Opens up eastern opportunities!\n- BUT... moving RIGHT takes us toward the edge of the board (column 9 is the limit)\n- This could TRAP us if the enemy starts boxing us in from the west\n- We need to stay FLEXIBLE with our eastern control! \n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf THE PLAY:\n\nChat, DOWN to (6, 5) is the CHAMPIONSHIP MOVE here! Here's why:\n\n1. **SAFE AND SOLID!** Zero collision risk! We're clear! \u2705\n2. **MAINTAINS MOMENTUM!** We continue our dominant southward push down the east side! The board positioning stays IN OUR FAVOR!\n3. **KEEPS OPTIONS OPEN!** From (6, 5) next turn, we can go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT depending on apple spawns and enemy positioning!\n4. **ENEMY IS SUFFOCATING!** Snake #0 is getting BOXED IN tighter and tighter in the northwest corner! They're running out of real estate FAST!\n5. **APPLE FARMING!** There are apples at (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3) - we can systematically HARVEST this region!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT TURN GAME PLAN (TURN 49+):\n\n**Turn 48 (NOW):** DOWN to (6, 5) - Keep the eastern dominance rolling!\n\n**Turn 49:** Evaluate board state. If clear, continue DOWN to (6, 4) OR pivot LEFT to grab apples in the (5, 4)-(5, 3) zone!\n\n**Turn 50+:** SYSTEMATIC APPLE COLLECTION in the southern-central region while enemy DESPERATELY scrambles for scraps in the cramped northwest! By turn 60, we'll have 25+ apples while they're stuck at 18-19! That's a CHAMPIONSHIP lead! \ud83d\udc51\n\nThis is RELENTLESS. This is CALCULATED. This is how we WIN! Let's GOOOOO!\n\nDOWN",

The enemy is SUFFOCATING in their box while we're sitting on a GOLDMINE of apples!\n\n**UP to (7, 6)** is the OBVIOUS CHAMPIONSHIP MOVE here because:\n\n1. **INSTANT APPLE!** \ud83c\udf4e We jump to 22-19! That's a COMMANDING 3-apple lead!\n2. **KEEPS OPTIONS OPEN!** From (7, 6), we can:\n   - Continue UP to (7, 7) - that area is OPEN!\n   - Move RIGHT to (8, 6) - another apple is waiting there!\n   - Move LEFT back toward center if needed!\n3. **MOMENTUM IS EVERYTHING!** Every turn we grab food while they're boxed in is PSYCHOLOGICALLY DEVASTATING!\n4. **THE BOARD FAVORS US!** Apples at (7, 6), (8, 6), (4, 7) are in our sphere of control!\n5. **THEY CAN'T STOP US!** Their head at (5, 4) is too far away to intercept!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb NEXT TURN STRATEGY (TURN 51+):\n\n**Turn 50 (NOW):** UP to (7, 6) - **GRAB THAT APPLE!

By turn 60, we should have 25+ apples while they're stuck at 19-20!\n\n**Win Condition:** Keep them boxed, keep eating, reach 30 first! They CANNOT catch us from the west! The game is OURS to lose!\n\nThis is CALCULATED DOMINANCE! This is why we STREAM! LET'S GOOOOOO! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\udc51\n\nUP",

We're in a TIGHT COIL right now but RIGHT is the ONLY legal move, and guess what? **IT GRABS ANOTHER APPLE!** \n\nWe're about to hit 23 apples vs their 20! We're UNSTOPPABLE!

Let\u2019s break it down:\n\n- **UP** to (3,4) drops us on the apple, sure, but it also keeps us in the middle of our own tail while we\u2019re trying to thread a trap. That space up there is borderline cramped once we grab (3,5) next, and the crowd\u2019s calling for a smarter play than just chasing the stack.\n- **LEFT** to (2,3) keeps us safe, but it\u2019s a neutral dance move\u2014the apple party\u2019s happening elsewhere, and I\u2019d rather not drift too far from the loot corridor or let the enemy slide back toward the center.\n- **DOWN** to (3,2) is the high-content play: immediate apple, opens up (2,2)/(1,2)/(0,2), and keeps our options wide along that bottom-left pocket while the rival is still wrestling around the right wall. Safe, tidy, no head-on threats, and it gives us real space to build our box.\n\nPlan: After scooping the (3,2) apple, we loop toward (1,2)/(0,2) to lock down the bottom-left, keep our tail flexing in that pocket, and force Snake #1 to stay on their side where we can keep them caged in for the long haul.\n\nDOWN",

Wait... did Snake #0 grab an apple?? No matter! We're STILL ahead and the win is in SIGHT! Only 7 more apples to hit 30 and LOCK IN the championship! Let's dissect this board with LASER FOCUS! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccd CURRENT SITUATION:\n\n**My Snake (ID 1):**\n- Head: (8, 7) \u2705 We're in the UPPER EASTERN ZONE!\n- Body length: 24\n- Apples: 23 \ud83c\udfc6\n- Status: **STRONG POSITION - ROOM TO MANEUVER!**\n\n**Enemy Snake #0:**\n- Head: (3, 3)\n- Body length: 21\n- Apples: 21\n- Status: **THEY'RE BOXED IN! STILL LOSING!**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 FOUR-DIRECTION ANALYSIS:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (8, 8)\n- Row 8, column 8...\n- Looking at board: Row 8 shows `. T T T A T T T T T`\n- Position (8, 8) = `T` **THAT'S ENEMY BODY!** Snake #0's body segment! \n- \u274c **COLLISION WITH ENEMY DEATH TRAP!** \u274c\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (8, 6)\n- Row 6, column 8...\n- That's where we JUST came from!\n- Looking at body list: (8, 6) is our current head position, so (8, 6) after we move becomes a body segment!\n- Wait, let me recalculate: We moved UP, so our tail segment just disappeared!\n- (8, 6) was our head, now our body is [(8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5)...] \n- So (8, 6) is now our FIRST body segment (directly behind our head)!\n- \u274c **SELF-COLLISION! CAN'T REVERSE!** \u274c\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (7, 7)\n- Row 7, column 7...\n- Looking at board: Row 7 shows `. T T . A T T T 1 T`\n- Position (7, 7) = `T` **THAT'S MY OWN BODY!** \n- Body list shows (7, 7) is part of my snake!\n- \u274c **SELF-COLLISION!** \u274c\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (9, 7)\n- Row 7, column 9...\n- Looking at board: Row 7 shows `. T T . A T T T 1 T`\n- Position (9, 7) = `T` **THAT'S ENEMY SNAKE BODY!**\n- \u274c **COLLISION WITH ENEMY!** \u274c\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 WAIT WAIT WAIT... CHAT, WE HAVE A PROBLEM! \ud83d\udea8\n\nHold up... I'm reading the board state and ALL four directions seem blocked?? Let me RE-READ this board CAREFULLY...\n\n**BOARD VISUALIZATION:**\n```\n 9 . . A T T T T T T .\n 8 . T T T A T T T T T     <- Row 8\n 7 A T T . A T T T 1 T     <- Row 7, our head is at (8,7) = \"1\"\n 6 . A T T T T T T T T\n 5 . A . A T T T T . T\n```\n\nWait... Looking at row 8 again: `. T T T A T T T T T`\nColumns:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nPosition (8, 8) = the 9th column (0-indexed) in row 8 = `T`\n\nThat's definitely an enemy segment. And row 7 shows our head at position (8, 7).\n\nLet me trace enemy snake #0 body more carefully:\nHead: (3, 3), then Body: [(4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5)]\n\nSo enemy body includes: (6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 8), (5, 9)...\n\nHmm, position (8, 8) should NOT be enemy... unless I'm misreading coordinates!\n\nOH CHAT! I think I see the issue - let me look at what MY body is!\n\nMy body: [(8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 3), (7, 3)]\n\n**(8, 8) IS MY OWN BODY SEGMENT!**\n**(7, 7) IS MY OWN BODY SEGMENT!**\n**(9, 7) IS MY OWN BODY SEGMENT!**\n\nSo:\n- UP (8, 8) = MY BODY \u274c\n- DOWN (8, 6) = MY BODY (what I just vacated) \u274c\n- LEFT (7, 7) = MY BODY \u274c\n- RIGHT (9, 7) = MY BODY \u274c\n\nCHAT... ARE WE... ARE WE ACTUALLY BOXED IN?? \n\nWait no... I moved UP last turn from (8, 6) to (8, 7). My tail just shed. So (8, 6) should be EMPTY now since my tail was at (7, 3) and it disappeared!\n\nActually, when a snake moves and doesn't eat, the TAIL disappears. So after I moved UP:\n- New head: (8, 7)\n- Old tail (7, 3): GONE\n- My body now: [(8, 7), (8, 6), (7, 6), (7, 5), ... (8, 3)] - everything except (7, 3)\n\nSo DOWN to (8, 6) should be... wait that's my NEW first body segment after the move! Still can't go there!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf REALITY CHECK:\n\nThis is BRUTAL, chat. I might actually be TRAPPED in my own coil! Let me verify every single cell one more time with EXTREME CARE...\n\nActually, you know what? Let me just pick the LEAST LETHAL option. If I'm surrounded by my own body, I'm in DEEP trouble. But wait - the game shows we're still alive, so ONE direction must be valid!\n\nLooking at the board pattern - positions (8, 6), (7, 7), (8, 8), (9, 7) all show as occupied in my body. \n\nLet me try DOWN - maybe (8, 6) became free after the tail shed at (7, 3)!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE:\n\nWE NEED TO MAKE SPACE! This is a DEFENSIVE situation now. We're boxed in by our own body and need to find ANY escape route next turn. The coil is TOO TIGHT! We need to unwind and create corridors!\n\nDOWN",
