Length: 1.\n    *   Enemy Snake (ID 0): Head at (2, 8). Body: Empty. Apples: 0. Length: 1.\n    *   Apples: Numerous scattered around. Key targets near me are (5, 9), (4, 7), (8, 8).\n\n2.  **Determine My Possible Moves:**\n    *   Head: (4, 8).\n    *   Possible Next Positions:\n        *   UP: (4, 9)\n        *   DOWN: (4, 7)\n        *   LEFT: (3, 8)\n        *   RIGHT: (5, 8)\n\n3.  **Evaluate Safety of Possible Moves (Self-Collision & Board Limits):**\n    *   Since my body is empty, I cannot self-collide except by moving off the board.\n    *   (4, 9): Safe (Within bounds 0-9).\n    *   (4, 7): Safe (Within bounds 0-9). Note: This is an apple location.\n    *   (3, 8): Safe (Within bounds 0-9).\n    *   (5, 8): Safe (Within bounds 0-9). Note: This is an apple location.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Enemy Snake Movement and Safety Interactions:**\n    *   Enemy Head (E0) is at (2, 8).\n    *   Enemy Possible Moves (assuming standard competitive play; they will likely target apples or try to block/corner me):\n        *   UP: (2, 9)\n        *   DOWN: (2, 7)\n        *   LEFT: (1, 8)\n        *   RIGHT: (3, 8)\n\n    *   Now, check potential collisions with E0's resulting position:\n\n    *   **If I move UP to (4, 9):**\n        *   E0 moves to (2, 9), (2, 7), (1, 8), or (3, 8). None hit (4, 9). SAFE from immediate collision.\n\n    *   **If I move DOWN to (4, 7):** (This eats Apple (4, 7))\n        *   E0 moves to (2, 9), (2, 7), (1, 8), or (3, 8). None hit (4, 7). SAFE from immediate collision. *Eating an apple is highly desirable.*\n\n    *   **If I move LEFT to (3, 8):**\n        *   E0 might move RIGHT to (3, 8). This results in a **HEAD-ON COLLISION**. If E0 chooses RIGHT, I die, and E0 dies. Since E0 is trying to survive and win, they might move here if they see it as favorable (e.g., getting to a better position while perhaps threatening me). **This move carries a risk of mutual death.**\n\n    *   **If I move RIGHT to (5, 8):** (This eats Apple (5, 8))\n        *   E0 moves to (2, 9), (2, 7), (1, 8), or (3, 8). None hit (5, 8). SAFE from immediate collision. *Eating an apple is highly desirable.*\n\n5.  **Compare Safe, Apple-Eating Moves (DOWN vs. RIGHT):**\n    *   Move DOWN to (4, 7): Eats apple at (4, 7). New Head position (4, 7).\n    *   Move RIGHT to (5, 8): Eats apple at (5, 8). New Head position (5, 8).\n\n    *   **Proximity to other assets:**\n        *   (4, 7) is closer to my current vicinity and puts me near apples (6, 7), (4, 7 - eaten), (5, 8).\n        *   (5, 8) is closer to apples (5, 9), (8, 8), and the enemy head (2, 8) is somewhat further away compared to moving down towards the center/bottom half of the board.\n\n    *   Both moves achieve growth and survival. Moving towards (5, 8) keeps me near the top row, which currently has high apple density ((4,8), (5,8), (8,8), (5,9)). Moving to (4, 7) moves me slightly inward/downward.\n\n    *   Let's look at the board structure resulting from these moves:\n        *   If I go RIGHT to (5, 8), I am adjacent to the apple at (5, 9).\n        *   If I go DOWN to (4, 7), I am adjacent to the apple at (6, 7) and below the enemy on Y axis.\n\n    *   Since both are equally safe choices that gain points, I prefer the move that keeps the most options open or targets the nearest subsequent apple path. Moving RIGHT to (5, 8) positions me immediately below (5, 9) for the next turn, assuming the enemy doesn't take it first.\n\n6.  **Final Check on Risky Move (LEFT):**\n    *   Moving LEFT to (3, 8) puts me exactly where the enemy *could* go if they choose RIGHT. Because simultaneous movement means we both die if we land on the same spot, and since the enemy has an equal incentive to threaten my space or secure an apple, risking a mutual head-on collision when two safer growth moves exist is generally poor strategy unless necessary for survival or a key objective. I will avoid (3, 8).\n\n7.  **Decision:** Both RIGHT (to (5, 8)) and DOWN (to (4, 7)) are excellent. RIGHT seems marginally better as it keeps me on the axis containing (5, 9), a high-value apple.\n\nStrategy Note: Prioritize immediate growth by eating apples unless blocked or threatened. Avoid mutual collision spots.\n\nMove: RIGHT\n\n(Self-Correction: Re-checking (5, 8) apple. Yes, it exists. Re-checking (4, 7) apple. Yes, it exists. Both good. Going RIGHT.)\n\nMy chosen move is RIGHT.\n\nUP\nDOWN\nLEFT\nRIGHT",

Both snakes are on the same row (y=8), with the enemy snake two cells to my right.\n2. There are apples at (6,7), (5,9), (3,0), etc., but the closest ones to me are:\n   - (1,8) - left of me\n   - (5,8) - right of me (but enemy is at (4,8), so this is between us)\n   - (6,7) - diagonally up-right\n   - (4,7) - directly below enemy\n\n**Possible Moves:**\nLet's evaluate each direction:\n\n1. **UP (y+1 to (2,9)):**\n   - Safe? Yes, no walls or bodies there.\n   - Pros: Moves away from enemy, opens up top of board.\n   - Cons: No immediate apple, but could position for future moves.\n\n2. **DOWN (y-1 to (2,7)):**\n   - Safe? Yes, no walls or bodies there.\n   - Pros: Moves toward center of board, could head toward (1,8) apple later.\n   - Cons: No immediate apple.\n\n3. **LEFT (x-1 to (1,8)):**\n   - Safe? Yes, no walls or bodies there.\n   - Pros: **Eats apple at (1,8)!** This is the best immediate gain.\n   - Cons: None obvious. Enemy is to my right, so moving left doesn't risk collision.\n\n4. **RIGHT (x+1 to (3,8)):**\n   - Safe? Yes, no walls or bodies there.\n   - Pros: Moves toward center, could head toward (5,8) apple.\n   - Cons: **Dangerous!** Enemy is at (4,8). If they move left next turn, we could collide at (3,8) on their next move. Also, moving right brings me closer to the enemy without immediate gain.\n\n**Enemy Considerations:**\n- Enemy is at (4,8). If I move RIGHT to (3,8), and they move LEFT to (3,8), we collide and both die. This is risky.\n- If I move LEFT to (1,8) to eat the apple, enemy could move LEFT to (3,8), which is safe for them but doesn't threaten me.\n- Moving UP or DOWN is safer but doesn't give immediate apple.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **LEFT to (1,8)** is the best because:\n  1. It's safe (no collision risk).\n  2. I eat an apple immediately, growing my snake and gaining a point.\n  3. It moves me away from the enemy, reducing collision risk.\n  4. After eating, my body will be at (2,8), so I need to be careful not to move back right into it next turn.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- After eating the apple at (1,8), my body will be at (2,8). Next turn, I should avoid moving RIGHT (back into my body).\n- The next closest apples are at (1,5) and (0,2), so I might head down-left after this.\n- Keep an eye on the enemy's position to avoid collisions.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nLEFT",

I must assume moving into (2, 8) is fatal for E0.\n    *   E0 Safe Moves: (1, 9), (1, 7), (0, 8).\n\n4.  **Evaluate My Moves against E0's Safe Moves:** (Target E0 collision or maximize growth)\n\n    *   **Move UP to (5, 9):** (Eats Apple, Grows)\n        *   E0 moves to (1, 9), (1, 7), or (0, 8). None collide with (5, 9).\n        *   **SAFE & GROWTH.** This adds to my length and secures the next apple. My new body would be [(5, 8), (4, 8)].\n\n    *   **Move DOWN to (5, 7):** (No apple)\n        *   E0 moves to (1, 9), (1, 7), or (0, 8). None collide with (5, 7).\n        *   SAFE, but yields no immediate growth. Low priority.\n\n    *   **Move RIGHT to (6, 8):** (No apple)\n        *   E0 moves to (1, 9), (1, 7), or (0, 8). None collide with (6, 8).\n        *   SAFE, but yields no immediate growth.\n\n5.  **Comparison:**\n    *   Moving UP to (5, 9) is the clear winner as it guarantees eating an apple, increasing length, and maintaining safety. This move puts me in a strong position for subsequent turns, potentially aiming for the apple at (8, 8) or moving towards the center structure.\n\n6.  **Long-Term Plan:** Secure immediate apples, maintain separation from E0, and try to corner E0 if possible, though currently, the board is wide open. The immediate focus is growing.\n\n**Decision:** UP\n\nStrategy Note: Prioritize immediate apple collection while ensuring the move does not lead to self-collision or collision with the enemy snake. Moving UP targets apple (5, 9) and keeps the path open above.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Apples: 2. Length: 3. (I ate (5, 9) last turn).\n    *   **Enemy Snake (E0):** Head: (1, 7) or (1, 9) or (0, 8), depending on its move. E0's previous head was (1, 8) and body was [(2, 8)]. My last move was UP to (5, 9). E0's last move was NOT explicitly given in the prompt analysis summary, but the state reflects the results of T=2. I must rely solely on the current state provided.\n    *   **Current Board State Interpretation:**\n        *   My Head: (5, 9). My Body: [(5, 8), (4, 8)].\n        *   E0 Head: (1, 7). E0 Body: [(1, 8)]. Apples: 1. (This indicates E0 moved DOWN from (1, 8) in turn 2, or it moved somewhere else: If E0 was at (1, 8) and its body was [(2, 8)], the state provided for T=3 shows E0 Head=(1, 7), Body=[(1, 8)]. This implies E0 ate an apple at a location that is NOT shown on the board (e.g., perhaps E0 ate (1, 8) and moved to (1, 7), but wait, E0 only had 1 apple previously. A move means the *old* tail dies unless an apple was eaten. If E0 moved from (1, 8) to (1, 7), its new body should be [(1, 8)]. The provided state might imply the tail has receded from the previous turn's state in the preceding Rationale section, but I must trust the *current* board state and coordinates given here.)\n\n    *   **Current State Check:**\n        *   Snakes are T (You, ID 1) and 0 (Enemy, ID 0).\n        *   T Head: (5, 9).

(4, 7) is diagonal DOWN-LEFT. (6, 7) is diagonal DOWN-RIGHT.\n\n3.  **Evaluate My Possible Moves from (5, 9):**\n    *   UP: (5, 10) -> **Off Board. DIE.**\n    *   DOWN: (5, 8) -> Hits my body! **Self-collision. DIE.**\n    *   LEFT: (4, 9)\n    *   RIGHT: (6, 9)\n\n4.  **Analyze E0's Position and Potential Moves (Head at (1, 7), Body at [(1, 8)]):**\n    *   E0 Possibilities:\n        *   UP: (1, 8) (Hits its own body! **DIE**)\n        *   DOWN: (1, 6) (Eats apple (1, 6)! **GROW**)\n        *   LEFT: (0, 7)\n        *   RIGHT: (2, 7)\n    *   E0's Safe/Greedy Moves: (1, 6) [Eats], (0, 7), (2, 7).\n\n5.  **Collision Check + Goal Evaluation (My move vs E0's safe moves):**\n\n    *   **Move LEFT to (4, 9):**\n        *   My New Head: (4, 9). My New Body: [(5, 9), (5, 8)].\n        *   Check against E0 potential heads:\n            *   If E0 -> (1, 6): No collision.\n            *   If E0 -> (0, 7): No collision.\n            *   If E0 -> (2, 7): No collision.\n        *   *Goal Check:* Does not eat an apple.\n\n    *   **Move RIGHT to (6, 9):**\n        *   My New Head: (6, 9). My New Body: [(5, 9), (5, 8)].\n        *   Check against E0 potential heads:\n            *   If E0 -> (1, 6): No collision.\n            *   If E0 -> (0, 7): No collision.\n            *   If E0 -> (2, 7): No collision.\n        *   *Goal Check:* Does not eat an apple. However, (6, 8) is an apple adjacent to (6, 9). This move positions me perfectly to attack (6, 8) next turn if E0 doesn't interfere.\n\n6.  **Strategy Refinement:**\n    Since there are no immediate captures available, safety and positioning are paramount. Moves UP and DOWN are suicide. I must choose between LEFT (4, 9) and RIGHT (6, 9).\n\n    *   (6, 9) sets up an immediate attack on apple (6, 8) next turn.\n    *   (4, 9) moves towards the top-left space, with apples (4, 7) being further away.\n\n    Given the favorable positioning to grab (6, 8) next, **RIGHT** seems strategically better for capturing immediate resources, assuming the enemy doesn't suddenly move into my intended path next turn. E0 is far away, so direct collision is minimal risk this turn.\n\n7.  **Long Term View/Plan:** Continue maximizing apple count. E0 is currently focused on the bottom left area or moving horizontally. I need to clear the top edge apples (like (8, 8) and (6, 8)). Moving RIGHT sets up (6, 8).\n\n**Decision:** RIGHT (To prepare for eating (6, 8) next turn).\n\nShort-Term Strategy Note: Move RIGHT to (6, 9) to set up an immediate attack on apple (6, 8) next turn. Ensure E0 does not suddenly block the path to (6, 8). E0 is unlikely to reach (6, 8) in one move, even if it eats (1, 6).\nRIGHT",

Yes, no walls or bodies there.\n   - Pros: Moves toward the apple at (0,2).\n   - Cons: No immediate apple, but could position for future moves.\n\n4. **RIGHT (x+1 to (2,6)):**\n   - Safe? Yes, no walls or bodies there.\n   - Pros: Moves toward the center of the board, opening up more options.\n   - Cons: No immediate apple, but could position for future moves.\n\n**Enemy Considerations:**\n- Enemy is at (6, 9), body at (5, 9), (5, 8). They are not immediately threatening my position.\n- They could move in any direction, but their body segments limit their movement.\n\n**Best Move:**\n- **DOWN to (1,5)** is the best because:\n  1. It's safe (no collision risk).\n  2. It moves me toward the apple at (1,5), which is directly below.\n  3. It keeps me away from the enemy, reducing collision risk.\n  4. After moving down, I can continue toward the apple at (1,4) next turn.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- After moving DOWN to (1,5), I should continue DOWN to (1,4) to eat the apple.\n- Keep an eye on the enemy's position to avoid collisions.\n- After eating the apple at (1,4), I can consider moving toward other apples like (0,2) or (1,8).\n\n**Final Decision:**\nDOWN",

(E0 moved down, missing apple (1, 5) which it seems to have avoided eating, or the board state reflects a state update error regarding E0's score vs apparent eating pattern. Trusting the score: E0 = 3 apples). *Re-checking E0 score: Previous turn E0 score was 2. If it moved to (1, 5) and ate (1, 5), score should be 3. Current state says E0 apples: 2. This implies E0 did NOT eat (1, 5) in T=4, or the apple (1, 5) was already gone. The board shows A at (1, 5). Let's check T=4 state again: E0 Head (1, 5). Apple (1, 5) IS there. If E0 moved to (1, 5) and ate it, score increases. If the score didn't change from 2 to 3, it means E0 did not eat the apple at (1, 5) OR the apple at (1, 5) was already eaten prior to T=4 (which contradicts the board showing A=(1, 5) AND E0 score=2). Given the contradiction, I trust the board location information and assume the score update might lag or be slightly erroneous regarding the exact action taken last turn, but I must use the provided Board State and Scores.*\n    *   **Crucial Assumption:** I treat E0's score as 2 (as listed) unless I clearly see it eat an apple this turn. The apple at (1, 5) is **still present** on the board in the current state visualization, BUT the E0 head is NOW at (1, 4). This means E0 moved 1 step further DOWN, and missed the apple at (1, 5) or it was eaten by another entity (impossible in this 2-player game) or the provided state maps are inconsistent.*\n    *   **Re-evaluating Board State:**\n        *   Turn 5 Board: E0 Head (1, 5), Apple (1, 5) present. E0 Score 2.\n        *   Turn 6 Board: E0 Head (1, 4), Apple (1, 5) present. E0 Score 2.\n        *   Conclusion: E0 deliberately or accidentally moved away from (1, 5) in T=5, OR the board state provided already reflects the result of T=5 move, and E0's move was **DOWN** to (1, 4) (since E0 was at (1, 5) last turn, and it is now at (1, 4) having not grown). This means E0's tail receded, and its score correctly remains 2.\n\n2.  **Target Selection for Me (Head at (6, 7)):**\n    *   Nearest apples: (6, 4) is 3 steps away.
