Post-eat, enemy at (3,9), then could DOWN col 3 (blocked by own body) or RIGHT/DOWN to col 4 row 5\u2014risky head-on at (4,5) if I arrive turn 13 (my path: t10 LEFT (7,5), t11 (6,5), t12 (5,5), t13 (4,5); enemy post-eat t11 possibly RIGHT (4,9) but slow, earliest to (4,5) ~t15 via circuitous path around body). Low collision probability (enemy body clogs col 3/4 rows 7-8; they may target (1,5) or (0,4) south instead). UP > LEFT (fewer steps to apple, straighter snake for evasion), >> RIGHT (dead-end risk). Avoids south commitment.\n\n### Long-Term Plan\nTurn 9: UP to (8,5) (row 5 entry, open for LEFTs). Turns 10-13: LEFT x3 to (5,5), then LEFT to (4,5) eat for 3 apples (monitor enemy\u2014if they eat (3,9) and head RIGHT/DOWN col 4, divert at t12 to UP (5,6) empty detour then LEFT to (4,5) or continue to (1,5) t16 for 4 apples).

Turn 16 LEFT eat (1,5), grow to 5 (span cols 1-5 row 5). Then to (0,4): from (1,5) DOWN to (1,4) empty then LEFT to (0,4) (2 steps, eat +1 to 5). If enemy nears left side, pivot RIGHT+DOWN to (2,3) apple (~3-4 steps from post-(1,5)). Avoid north/cols 6+ (my old tail frees Turn 14, but enemy territory). Watch for enemy growth blocking (2,3) or south push.\n\nLEFT",

Post-move: head (4,6), body [(4,5),(5,5),(6,5)] (tail frees (7,5), length 4). Future options: 3 (UP (4,7) empty, LEFT (3,6) empty, RIGHT (5,6) empty; DOWN own body). Moves north into potentially enemy-influenced area, distances to apples increase (e.g., (1,5) now ~4 steps vs current 3), limits south/west access.\n- **DOWN** to (4,4): Empty (row 4, col 4 open). No collision. Post-move: head (4,4), body [(4,5),(5,5),(6,5)] (tail frees (7,5)). Future options: 3 (DOWN (4,3) empty, LEFT (3,4) empty, RIGHT (5,4) empty; UP own). Positions south toward (2,4)/(5,1), but skips row 5 apples; ~3 steps to (2,4), potential detour if enemy blocks col 2.\n- **LEFT** to (3,5): Empty (row 5, col 3 open). No collision. Post-move: head (3,5), body [(4,5),(5,5),(6,5)] (tail frees (7,5)). Future options: 3 (LEFT (2,5) empty, UP (3,6) empty, DOWN (3,4) empty; RIGHT own). Advances west on row 5 toward (1,5) (~2 more steps), flexible pivots up/down.\n- **RIGHT** to (5,5): Own body, immediate suicide.\n\nNo head-on collisions possible this turn (enemy possible new heads: (1,7)/(2,6)/(3,7); none overlap my options). No backwards move (last was LEFT, backwards would be RIGHT, already invalid).\n\n### Prioritization\nSafe: UP, DOWN, LEFT. Enemy at north col 2 likely moves south (DOWN to (2,6) probable for apples like (2,4)), but no immediate threat to row 5 col 3-4. UP wasteful: detours from all apples (adds 1-2 steps), enters enemy zone with limited scoring. DOWN good for southern flank ((2,4) in 2 steps from there), opens (5,1) path, but cedes row 5 control. LEFT optimal: progresses to closest apple (1,5) in 3 total steps, maintains row 5 dominance (my length spans it), high flexibility to pivot if enemy descends col 2 (monitor next turn for (2,6); avoid direct conflict). Ties score momentum (+1 soon) without narrowing options more than DOWN. Enemy growth risk low this turn (no nearby apple for it).\n\n### Long-Term Plan\nTurn 14 LEFT (3,5), length 4 (body (4,5)-(6,5), frees col 7/6 row 5). Turn 15: If enemy not at (2,6) (went LEFT/RIGHT), LEFT (2,5) safe, then turn 16 LEFT eat (1,5) (+1 to 4 apples, grow to 5, head (1,5) body to (5,5)). If enemy at (2,6) (southbound), DOWN (3,4) avoid potential (2,5) head-on; turn 16 from (3,4): if enemy post-15 not threatening (2,4) (not at (2,5)), LEFT eat (2,4) (+1 to 4, grow 5); else DOWN (3,3) evade, then left/down to (2,3) if safe or west to (0,4) (~3-4 steps total from now, eat +1 to 4). Post-eat (1,5)/(2,4)/(0,4), pivot south: e.g., from (1,5) DOWN (1,4) LEFT eat (0,4) if uneaten, or DOWN to row 3/2 then RIGHT to (5,1) (~4-5 steps, uncontested). Keep left of enemy col 2, use length to block if needed; target tie at 5-5 by eating 2 while enemy gets 1, then dominate south center. Avoid north (cols 0-1 row 6+ risky with enemy body). If enemy deviates (e.g., LEFT to col 1), seize (2,4)/(2,3).\n\nLEFT",

Post-move: head (3,6), body [(3,5),(4,5),(5,5),(6,5)] wait no\u2014tail at (6,5) shifts, new body [(3,5),(4,5),(5,5),(6,5)] but actually after move, body follows head path, tail frees old tail if no eat (frees whatever was tail pre-move, which was (6,5) post-last, but length 4 steady). Risk: Enemy head from (2,6) could RIGHT to (3,6), head-on collision (both die, I lose 3-4). Enemy likely DOWN to (2,5) for south apples (2,4)/(2,3), but RIGHT possible if aiming north or trap. Future options: ~2 (UP (3,7) empty but near enemy body col3 row9; RIGHT (4,6) empty; LEFT (2,6) now enemy head pos but post-move enemy elsewhere; DOWN own body). Detours from apples (e.g., (1,5) now ~3-4 steps via south loop vs direct west), enters enemy north territory with lengthening body risk.\n- **DOWN** to (3,4): Empty (row 4, col 3 open, no apple there). No collision. Post-move: head (3,4), body [(3,5),(4,5),(5,5),(6,5)] (tail frees old (6,5)? Wait, standard: body [(4,5),(5,5),(6,5),(3,5)? No\u2014head moves to (3,4), old head (3,5) becomes neck, tail drops last unless grow. Precise: pre-move full [(3,5)h,(4,5),(5,5),(6,5)t], post: [(3,4)h,(3,5),(4,5),(5,5)] tail frees (6,5), follows head. Future options: 3 (DOWN (3,3) empty; LEFT (2,4) apple!; RIGHT (4,4) empty; UP own). Positions for quick (2,4) eat next (~1 step), then pivot to (0,4) west or (2,3) south/down; ~4 steps to (5,1) east viable. Avoids col2 row5 conflict.\n- **LEFT** to (2,5): Empty now (row 5, col 2 open). No self/edge. Post-move: head (2,5), body [(3,5),(4,5),(5,5),(6,5)] (frees (6,5) tail). Future options: 3 (LEFT (1,5) apple; UP (2,6) enemy current head but moves; DOWN (2,4) apple; RIGHT own). High reward: sets up (1,5) eat next turn. But high risk: Enemy from (2,6) DOWN probable to (2,5), head-on (both die, enemy wins 4-3). Even if not, enemy body trails north, could block (1,5) follow-up.\n- **RIGHT** to (4,5): Own body (immediate neck), suicide. Backwards from last LEFT, forbidden anyway.\n\nNo other collisions: Enemy possible heads (1,6 LEFT empty; 2,5 DOWN empty; 3,6 RIGHT empty; UP own). My options overlap only if I LEFT and enemy DOWN, or I UP and enemy RIGHT. No multi-snake body hits likely this turn.\n\n### Prioritization\nSafe: UP, DOWN, LEFT. RIGHT out. LEFT tempting for (1,5) path (2 steps total to eat, tie at 4-4, grow to 5 matching enemy length), but enemy DOWN to (2,5) highly likely (pursues south apples (2,4)/(2,3) in 1-2 steps, its col2 position screams southbound to contest my west push; north UP invalid, LEFT (1,6) detours from goals). Collision risk too high\u2014death loses game (enemy sole survivor wins). UP avoids that but risks enemy RIGHT (less likely, as enemy ignores north empty vs south food; still possible feint/block), and wastes steps (apple distances +1-2, traps in north corner near enemy 5-length body). DOWN safest: No overlap with enemy possibles, preserves life/options, enables (2,4) eat next if enemy takes (2,5) instead (from (3,4) LEFT to (2,4) uncontested, as enemy post-DOWN at (2,5) then might DOWN to (2,4) but simultaneous\u2014 if it does, head-on but I eat first? No, eat on move to apple, but collision kills before. Wait, rules: move to apple grows after move, but collision checked on arrival. Still, if both to (2,4), both die but I ate (+1 to 4 vs enemy 4). Better: Assume enemy to (2,5), then next it to (2,4), so I can take (2,4) before or adjust. Keeps row5 body span for control, south open for (5,1). Momentum: Eat (2,4) turn 16 ties 4-4, grow 5; enemy gets none immediate ( (1,5) exposed but west of its path, (0,4) flank mine). Avoids trap, high flexibility.\n\n### Long-Term Plan\nPer prior: Enemy at (2,6) confirms southbound\u2014DOWN now to (3,4). Turn 16: From (3,4)\u2014if enemy post-15 at (2,5) (DOWN), and (2,4) free (enemy not RIGHT/UP to it impossible), LEFT to (2,4) eat (+1 to 4, grow 5, head (2,4) body (3,4)-(5,5) frees (6,5)); next turn 17 UP to (2,5) if safe (enemy likely south) or LEFT to (1,4) toward (0,4). If enemy post-15 not at (2,5) (e.g., RIGHT to (3,6) threat), then UP back (3,5) empty (my old body shifts), LEFT (2,5) then (1,5) if clear. If enemy contests (2,4) by going to (2,4) turn 16 (from wherever), evade RIGHT to (4,4) empty, then DOWN/LEFT to (5,1) (~3 steps) uncontested east, or west loop to (0,4) (~4 steps). Post-eat (2,4)/(1,5), claim (0,4) next (LEFT/DOWN from there, ~1-2 steps), tying 5-5; block enemy south with length (body row4-5), push to (2,3) or (5,1) for 6th while enemy stuck north/col2. If enemy deviates LEFT to (1,6), seize col2 row5 DOWN to (2,4) faster. Stay south-west of enemy, use 150-turn limit\u2014no rush north. Monitor for growth; if I hit 5 first, pressure its tail.\n\nDOWN",
