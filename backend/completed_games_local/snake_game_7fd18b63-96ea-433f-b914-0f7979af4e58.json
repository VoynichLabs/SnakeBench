(3, 6) \u2013 distance 1 (Manhattan = 1).  \n2. (4, 1) \u2013 distance 5.  \n3. (0, 2), (0, 3), (9, 8) \u2013 far.  \n\nLEFT to (3, 6) eats apple immediately \u2192 grow to length 2, body segment at (4, 6).  \n\nEating now is good because:  \n- Increases my apple count to 1 (enemy has 1, so tie).  \n- Grows my snake, which can help later for survival but also reduces space slightly.  \n\nHowever, eating apple at (3, 6) puts my head at (3, 6) and body at (4, 6). Next turn, possible moves from (3, 6): UP (3,7), DOWN (3,5), LEFT (2,6), RIGHT (4,6) but that\u2019s my body then \u2192 so RIGHT would be suicide next turn. Still, two other directions remain.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Alternative: avoid apple now?**  \n\nIf I don\u2019t eat apple now, enemy might get more ahead in apples. But eating now is safe and advances score.  \n\nPotential risk: after eating, my body occupies (4, 6), which might limit movement next turn, but not severely.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Consider enemy\u2019s likely move**  \n\nEnemy at (9, 3) with apple at (9, 8) far away, apple at (0, 2), (0, 3) far.  \nEnemy might go UP toward center or LEFT toward center. It won\u2019t go toward my position immediately.  \n\nNo immediate danger.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Decision**  \n\nEating the apple at (3, 6) is safe this turn, gives me a score, and keeps at least two safe moves next turn.  \nNot eating it delays score gain for no clear benefit.  \n\nLEFT seems best.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (3, 6), I\u2019ll have body at (4, 6). Next turn avoid moving RIGHT into my own body. Choose among UP, DOWN, LEFT depending on apple positions and enemy location. Try to stay safe and go toward another apple like (4, 1) or (0, 2)/(0, 3) if safe path exists.  \n\nLEFT",

Immediate death checks:**  \n\n**UP:** into own body at (3,2) \u2192 die \u2192 invalid.  \n\n**DOWN:** (3,0):  \n- In bounds? Yes.  \n- Occupied by my body? No.  \n- Occupied by enemy body? Enemy body is at (8,5) and (9,5) \u2192 no.  \n- Could enemy head move here? Enemy head at (9,5) possible moves: UP (9,6), DOWN (9,4), LEFT (8,5) (occupied by its own body), RIGHT (off board \u2192 invalid).  \nEnemy possible moves: UP (9,6), DOWN (9,4). Neither is (3,0). So no head-on collision possible this turn. Safe.  \n\n**LEFT:** (2,1):  \n- In bounds? Yes.  \n- Occupied by my body? No.  \n- Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n- Enemy possible moves again: UP (9,6), DOWN (9,4). Neither is (2,1). Safe.  \n\n**RIGHT:** (4,1):  \n- Contains apple \u2192 eating it \u2192 grow next turn (new tail segment added after moving).  \n- In bounds? Yes.  \n- Occupied by my body? No.  \n- Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n- Enemy possible moves again: UP (9,6), DOWN (9,4). Neither is (4,1). Safe.  \n\nSo UP is invalid; DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Strategic choice:**  \n\nEating an apple now increases length, which could limit future mobility slightly but gets closer to 50-apple win condition.  \nApple at (4,1) is adjacent \u2192 RIGHT gets apple.  \n\nBut: after eating, my body will be: head at (4,1), body [(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)] \u2192 length 4.  \n\nCheck next turn options from (4,1) after RIGHT:  \nFrom (4,1), possible moves: UP (4,2) free, DOWN (4,0) free, LEFT (3,1) occupied by my new neck, RIGHT (5,1) free. So 3 safe moves next turn. That\u2019s fine.  \n\nLEFT (2,1) leads to no apple but maybe toward apples (0,2),(0,3).  \n\nDOWN (3,0) leads to no apple.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Enemy future threat:**  \nEnemy at (9,5) length 2. It will likely try to eat apple at (9,8) or (4,8). Currently far from me. No immediate danger.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Long-term plan:**  \nAfter eating apple at (4,1), consider heading toward (0,2) or (0,3) apples while avoiding boxing self in. Keep options open.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Decision:**  \nRIGHT gets apple, is safe, keeps good options next turn. Better than delaying apple collection unnecessarily.  \n\nRIGHT",

Yes.  \n  - Occupied by my body? No.  \n  - Occupied by enemy body? Enemy body at (9,5) only, so no.  \n  - Could enemy head move here? Enemy head at (9,6) possible moves: UP (9,7), DOWN (9,5) (occupied by its own body), LEFT (8,6), RIGHT off board.  \n    Possible enemy moves: (9,7), (8,6). Neither is (4,2). So no head-on collision possible this turn. Safe.\n\n- **DOWN (4,0):**  \n  - In bounds? Yes.  \n  - Occupied by my body? No.  \n  - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n  - Enemy head possible moves: (9,7), (8,6). Neither is (4,0). Safe.\n\n- **RIGHT (5,1):**  \n  - In bounds? Yes.  \n  - Occupied by my body? No.  \n  - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n  - Enemy head possible moves: (9,7), (8,6). Neither is (5,1). Safe.\n\nAll three moves appear safe from immediate death.\n\n---\n\n**Strategic evaluation:**\nApples:  \n- (0,2), (0,3) are far left.  \n- (4,8) is up-right from me.  \n- (6,7) is further right and up.  \n- (9,8) is top-right corner (enemy is near it).\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (9,6), likely heading for (9,8) apple soon. I should avoid heading directly into its path if possible, but currently far from it.\n\nFrom (4,1):\n- **UP (4,2)** \u2192 moves toward apples (4,8) and (6,7) generally, keeps central position.\n- **DOWN (4,0)** \u2192 moves away from most apples, toward bottom edge, fewer options later.\n- **RIGHT (5,1)** \u2192 moves toward (6,7) apple direction but still far, slightly closer to right side.\n\nCheck next turn options after each move:\n- After UP to (4,2): possible moves from there: UP (4,3), DOWN (4,1) (occupied by my body then? Wait, after moving, body will be: head (4,2), neck (4,1), then (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)? Let\u2019s check: current body: [(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)]. After UP move: head (4,2), new body becomes [(4,1),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)]? Actually, snake grows only if eats apple. We didn\u2019t eat apple this turn, so length stays 4. Movement: head to (4,2), tail (3,3) disappears, body becomes [(4,1),(3,1),(3,2)]. So from (4,2) next turn:  \n  - UP (4,3) free,  \n  - DOWN (4,1) occupied by my body,  \n  - LEFT (3,2) occupied by my body,  \n  - RIGHT (5,2) free.  \n  So only 2 safe moves next turn (UP, RIGHT). That\u2019s slightly limiting.\n\n- After DOWN to (4,0): next turn from (4,0):  \n  Body: [(4,1),(3,1),(3,2)].  \n  Possible: UP (4,1) occupied by body, DOWN off board, LEFT (3,0) free, RIGHT (5,0) free.  \n  So only 2 safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT). Also limiting.\n\n- After RIGHT to (5,1): next turn from (5,1):  \n  Body: [(4,1),(3,1),(3,2)].  \n  Possible: UP (5,2) free, DOWN (5,0) free, LEFT (4,1) occupied by body, RIGHT (6,1) free.  \n  So 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). More options.\n\nRIGHT gives the most flexibility next turn.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT slightly toward center-right apples (6,7) and (4,8), while staying away from enemy\u2019s immediate area (top-right).\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**\nWe\u2019re length 4, enemy length 2. Keep collecting apples but avoid trapping ourselves. After RIGHT to (5,1), consider moving UP toward (6,7) or (4,8) apples, but watch enemy movement near (9,8). If enemy goes for (9,8), it will be near top edge for a bit. We can snake around middle-left apples later.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

No, body will move forward next turn, so (5, 2) might be free. LEFT (4, 3), RIGHT (6, 3) \u2014 all likely safe unless enemy moves there, but enemy far. Good options.  \nLEFT (4, 2): next moves: UP (4, 3), DOWN (4, 1) \u2014 that\u2019s currently my body segment, but next turn it will move? Actually, body moves forward each turn, so (4, 1) might be vacated if I go LEFT? Wait, my body: head (5, 2) \u2192 (5, 1) \u2192 (4, 1) \u2192 (3, 1). If I move LEFT to (4, 2), then new body: (4, 2) \u2192 (5, 2) \u2192 (5, 1) \u2192 (4, 1). So (3, 1) is dropped (tail moves). So (4, 1) is now 3rd segment, so DOWN from (4, 2) goes to (4, 1) which is my body \u2192 invalid next turn. So LEFT reduces future DOWN option.  \nRIGHT (6, 2): similar issue? Actually, RIGHT to (6, 2) \u2192 new body: (6, 2) \u2192 (5, 2) \u2192 (5, 1) \u2192 (4, 1). So DOWN from (6, 2) = (6, 1) free, UP free, LEFT free, RIGHT free. So RIGHT keeps all 4 options next turn.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nWe have many apples. Want to avoid trapping myself. Going LEFT toward (0, 2) risks moving into left edge with fewer future moves. Going UP or RIGHT seems better for keeping space. UP moves away from left-side apples but toward center.  \n\nGiven enemy is far right, I can go UP to gain more space and possibly loop toward (4, 8) or (6, 7) later.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose UP for safety and future flexibility.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

That\u2019s dangerous.  \nIf I move LEFT to (4, 5), enemy can\u2019t reach there in one move (its LEFT is (6, 5), UP/DOWN don\u2019t reach (4,5)).  \nIf I move UP to (5, 6), enemy can\u2019t reach there in one move (its UP is (7,6), DOWN (7,4), LEFT (6,5)).  \n\nSo RIGHT is risky due to potential head-on collision.  \nLEFT and UP are safe from immediate head-on collision.\n\n**Apple distances from candidate head positions:**  \nFrom UP (5, 6):  \n- (4, 8): dist 1+2=3  \n- (6, 7): dist 1+1=2  \n- (9, 8): dist 4+2=6  \n- (0, 2): dist 5+4=9  \n- (0, 3): dist 5+3=8  \n\nFrom LEFT (4, 5):  \n- (4, 8): dist 0+3=3  \n- (6, 7): dist 2+2=4  \n- (9, 8): dist 5+3=8  \n- (0, 2): dist 4+3=7  \n- (0, 3): dist 4+2=6  \n\nFrom RIGHT (6, 5) \u2014 risky:  \n- (6, 7): dist 0+2=2 (closest) but risky.\n\n**Future mobility after move:**  \nUP (5, 6): next moves: UP (5, 7), DOWN (5, 5) \u2014 empty next turn, LEFT (4, 6), RIGHT (6, 6). All safe unless enemy moves into them next turn.  \nLEFT (4, 5): next moves: UP (4, 6), DOWN (4, 4) \u2014 empty next turn, LEFT (3, 5), RIGHT (5, 5) \u2014 empty next turn. Good.\n\n**Enemy likely moves:** Enemy might go for (6, 7) apple via UP (7,6) then next turn (6,6) or (7,7), or might go LEFT toward (6,5) if it wants to contest. If it goes LEFT and I go RIGHT, we collide. So avoid RIGHT.\n\n**Strategy note:**  \nI have apple lead 3 vs 1. Survival is key. Avoid head-on collision risks.  \nLEFT is safe and moves toward left-side apples (0,2), (0,3), (4,8). UP is safe and moves toward (4,8) and (6,7).  \nUP puts me closer to (6,7) but enemy might also target that. However, enemy is at (7,5), to reach (6,7) it needs two moves: UP then LEFT or LEFT then UP. If I go UP to (5,6), I\u2019m one step closer but still need two moves to (6,7): RIGHT then UP or UP then RIGHT. Might be contested but not immediate risk.\n\nLEFT seems slightly safer because enemy is less likely to go to left side soon (apples at 0,2 and 0,3 far). Also, LEFT keeps me away from enemy head.\n\n**Decision:**  \nEliminate RIGHT due to head-on collision risk.  \nBetween UP and LEFT: both safe this turn.  \nI\u2019ll choose LEFT to avoid potential future confrontation near (6,7) and to collect left-side apples while enemy might go for (6,7) or (9,8).\n\nLEFT",

All currently empty next turn.  \nDOWN (4, 4): next moves: UP (4,5), DOWN (4,3), LEFT (3,4), RIGHT (5,4). RIGHT (5,4) is my body currently, but next turn my body moves forward so (5,4) might be empty? Wait: my body segments: head moves to new position, then each segment shifts forward. Current body: [(5,5), (5,4), (5,3)]. If head moves to (4,6), new body becomes [(4,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3)] but tail (5,3) stays unless apple eaten. No apple eaten, so tail moves off (5,3), so (5,4) becomes (5,5)'s old position? Actually:  \nNew head \u2192 (4,6)  \nBody[0] \u2192 old head (4,5)  \nBody[1] \u2192 old body[0] (5,5)  \nBody[2] \u2192 old body[1] (5,4)  \nTail (5,3) disappears.  \nSo next turn positions: head (4,6), body segments at (4,5), (5,5), (5,4).  \nThus (5,4) will be occupied next turn if I move UP.  \nSo from (4,6), RIGHT (5,6) is safe next turn, DOWN (4,5) is occupied by my own new body segment 1, so invalid next turn. So UP from (4,6) gives fewer safe moves next turn (DOWN blocked).  \n\nDOWN (4,4): new head (4,4), body: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)], tail (5,3) gone.  \nFrom (4,4) next turn: UP (4,5) is my own body \u2192 invalid, DOWN (4,3) empty, LEFT (3,4) empty, RIGHT (5,4) empty (since (5,4) is now my body? Wait: body segments: (4,5), (5,5), (5,4) \u2014 yes (5,4) is my body, so RIGHT (5,4) is occupied. So only DOWN and LEFT safe next turn.  \n\nLEFT (3,5): new head (3,5), body: [(4,5), (5,5), (5,4)], tail (5,3) gone.  \nFrom (3,5) next turn: UP (3,6) empty, DOWN (3,4) empty, LEFT (2,5) empty, RIGHT (4,5) my body \u2192 invalid. So three safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Enemy likely moves:**  \nEnemy at (6,5) will likely avoid LEFT into my body (death), so will go UP to (6,6) or DOWN to (6,4).  \nApple at (6,7) is close to them: from (6,6) they\u2019d be 1 step away vertically. They may go UP toward it.  \nIf enemy goes UP to (6,6), I could go UP to (4,6) then next turn move toward (4,8) apple safely without conflict.  \n\n**Strategy note:**  \nI have apple lead 3 vs 1. Survival is key. UP gets me closest to apple (4,8) in 2 steps. LEFT keeps options open with 3 safe moves next turn. DOWN reduces future moves to 2 safe ones.  \nUP\u2019s drawback: next turn DOWN is blocked by my own body, but I can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT. That\u2019s still 3 safe moves if board stays clear.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nCollect (4,8) apple quickly, then consider (0,2) or (0,3) if safe. Avoid enemy near (6,7) \u2014 enemy may go for that apple. Let them have (6,7) if contested; we have left-side apples.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nUP is safe, gets closest to apple, and keeps reasonable future mobility.  \nLEFT also safe and gives slightly better next-turn mobility but farther from immediate apple.  \nGiven apple lead, securing (4,8) seems good.  \n\nUP",

Since enemy knows I might move RIGHT into (5, 7), they might avoid LEFT to prevent collision. But if they think I\u2019ll avoid RIGHT, they might take LEFT. Risk exists.  \n\n**Risk assessment:**  \nRIGHT has possible head-on collision and fewer safe next moves.  \nUP gets apple, extends lead (4 vs 2), and is safe from collision.  \nLEFT is safe but delays apple.  \n\n**Strategy note for next turns:**  \nAfter eating (4, 8), I\u2019ll be at (4, 8) length 5. Enemy likely heading toward (9, 8) or (8, 4). I can consider moving toward left-side apples (0, 2) or (0, 3) to avoid confrontation while enemy is on right side. Keep distance from enemy head, maintain mobility.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nUP is safe, gets apple, increases lead, and keeps good future options.  \n\nUP",

Length 5 (4 body + head).  \nLast move was DOWN (from (2,7) to (2,6)).  \n\n**Enemy snake #1:**  \nHead at (8,8), body at [(9,8), (9,7), (8,7)], length 4.  \n\n**Apples:** (0,2), (0,3), (8,4), (3,3), (4,4).  \n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Check each possible move for immediate death\n\n**UP** to (2,7): That's my own body segment (second segment from last turn). Immediate death.  \n**DOWN** to (2,5): Safe \u2014 empty cell, not off board.  \n**LEFT** to (1,6): Safe \u2014 empty cell.  \n**RIGHT** to (3,6): Safe \u2014 empty cell.  \n\nSo UP is unsafe.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Consider enemy's possible moves this turn\n\nEnemy head at (8,8). Its possible moves:  \n- UP to (8,9): empty.  \n- DOWN to (8,7): its own body (last segment) \u2192 unsafe for it.  \n- LEFT to (7,8): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (9,8): its own body (second segment) \u2192 unsafe for it.  \n\nSo enemy's only safe moves are UP and LEFT.  \nEnemy moving UP to (8,9) or LEFT to (7,8) \u2014 neither collides with my possible moves (2,5), (1,6), (3,6) this turn, so no head-on collision risk now.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Safe follow-up moves after each candidate\n\nFrom (2,5):  \n- UP to (2,6) \u2192 body? Next turn my body will be [(2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,8), (4,8)] \u2014 wait, that\u2019s wrong:  \nActually, after moving DOWN to (2,5), my body becomes: head (2,5), tail shifts: old head (2,6) becomes second segment, (2,7) third, (2,8) fourth, (3,8) fifth, (4,8) sixth? No \u2014 I have length 5 now, so after moving without eating apple, my tail (4,8) disappears, body becomes: [(2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,8)].  \nSo next turn from (2,5):  \nUP to (2,6): body segment (second segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN to (2,4): empty.  \nLEFT to (1,5): empty.  \nRIGHT to (3,5): empty.  \nSo 3 safe follow-ups from (2,5).\n\nFrom (1,6): body next turn: [(1,6), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,8)].  \nUP to (1,7): empty.  \nDOWN to (1,5): empty.  \nLEFT to (0,6): empty.  \nRIGHT to (2,6): body segment \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 3 safe follow-ups from (1,6).\n\nFrom (3,6): body next turn: [(3,6), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,8)].  \nUP to (3,7): empty.  \nDOWN to (3,5): empty.  \nLEFT to (2,6): body segment \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT to (4,6): empty.  \nSo 3 safe follow-ups from (3,6).\n\nAll three safe moves give 3 safe follow-ups next turn.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Apple proximity\n\nClosest apples: (3,3) distance from head (2,6): |3-2|+|3-6|=1+3=4.  \n(4,4): |4-2|+|4-6|=2+2=4.  \n(8,4): 6, (0,2): 6, (0,3): 7.\n\nDOWN to (2,5): distances to (3,3): 1+2=3, to (4,4): 2+1=3 \u2014 improves both.  \nLEFT to (1,6): distances to (3,3): 2+3=5, to (4,4): 3+2=5 \u2014 worse.  \nRIGHT to (3,6): distances to (3,3): 0+3=3, to (4,4): 1+2=3 \u2014 improves both equally to DOWN.\n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT both improve apple distance equally.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Future mobility and safety\n\nFrom (2,5): central, can go DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT next turn.  \nFrom (3,6): can go UP/DOWN/RIGHT next turn.\n\nCheck board edges:  \nLEFT to (1,6) moves toward left wall with apples at (0,2)/(0,3), but that area is tight and enemy is far. Still, left side has fewer future options if I go further left next turn.\n\nGiven my body extends upward along column 2, moving RIGHT to (3,6) might give more space toward board center and apples at (3,3)/(4,4).\n\nBut moving DOWN to (2,5) also good \u2014 maybe better because it opens possibility to go LEFT to (1,5) or RIGHT to (3,5) next, both fine.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Enemy path\n\nEnemy at (8,8) likely to go UP to (8,9) or LEFT to (7,8). If it goes LEFT, it moves toward apple (8,4) eventually. But far from me. No direct threat now.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Long-term plan\n\nGoal: get to (3,3) or (4,4) safely. From (2,5), next turn could go RIGHT to (3,5) then DOWN toward apple. From (3,6), could go DOWN to (3,5) same. Actually similar.\n\nBut DOWN now avoids any chance enemy suddenly appears near (3,6)? No, enemy far.\n\nLet\u2019s choose DOWN: it\u2019s safe, improves apple distance, keeps options open.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (2,5), consider RIGHT to (3,5) then DOWN toward (3,3) or (4,4), but watch enemy movement. Avoid trapping near left wall if possible.\n\nDOWN",

Watch enemy movement \u2014 they may move toward apple (8, 4) eventually, but currently far.\n\nRIGHT",

Wait, check carefully:  \nEnemy body: [(8, 9), (8, 8), (9, 8)] \u2192 yes, (8, 9) is its body segment behind head, (9, 8) is its tail.  \nFrom (9, 9):  \nUP (9, 10) \u2192 off board (y=10 invalid).  \nDOWN (9, 8) \u2192 occupied by its tail (9, 8).  \nLEFT (8, 9) \u2192 occupied by its body (8, 9).  \nRIGHT (10, 9) \u2192 off board (x=10 invalid).  \n\n**Enemy has no safe moves** \u2192 Snake #1 will die this turn unless I\u2019m missing something (e.g., growth from apple eating changes tail position after movement). But apples: none adjacent to enemy head (9, 9). Closest apple is (8, 4) far away. So no growth this turn. So yes, enemy has no safe moves and will die this turn.  \n\nThat means if I survive this turn, I win immediately (all opponents dead).  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: My safe moves and immediate win condition  \n\nMy safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \nJust need to avoid killing myself.  \n\nCheck:  \nUP (3, 6): No enemy body there, not off board, not my body.  \nDOWN (3, 4): Empty, safe.  \nRIGHT (4, 5): Empty, safe.  \n\nAny of these will keep me alive, enemy dies simultaneously, I win.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Which is safest?  \n\nEven though enemy dies, I must still avoid my own body and walls. All three are safe now. But consider next turn\u2019s position for possible future if somehow enemy survives (maybe I misread rules). Let\u2019s double-check enemy\u2019s possible moves again:  \n\nEnemy head (9, 9):  \nBody cells: (8, 9), (8, 8), (9, 8).  \n\nCoordinates:  \n(9, 9) \u2192 head.  \nUP (9, 10) \u2192 invalid (y=10).  \nDOWN (9, 8) \u2192 occupied by (9, 8) (tail).  \nLEFT (8, 9) \u2192 occupied by (8, 9) (body).  \nRIGHT (10, 9) \u2192 invalid (x=10).  \n\nYes, all four are lethal. So enemy certainly dies.  \n\nThus my only objective: survive this move.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Choose move  \n\nAll three safe moves are fine.  \nPick one that keeps me central for possible apples next turn if game doesn\u2019t end (maybe rules: simultaneous death of all snakes ends game, but here only opponent dies, so I win instantly).  \n\nI\u2019ll pick **DOWN** to go toward apple (3, 3) and (4, 4), but since game ends, direction doesn\u2019t matter.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nActually, if enemy dies now, game ends immediately. So no next turn. But just in case, DOWN gives good access to apples next turn.  \n\nDOWN",
