Avoid moving back into (3,1). Consider moving toward other apples like (2,4) or (5,1) while keeping distance from enemy at (8,5).  \n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Wait, actually |3-2|=1, |2-4|=2, total 3).  \n- (1, 5) is farther.  \n- (5, 1) is farther.  \n- (1, 1) is closer in Manhattan distance: |3-1|+|2-1|=2+1=3.  \n- (8, 0) far.  \n\nFrom (3, 2):  \n- UP to (3, 3) \u2192 distances: to (2, 4) = |1|+|1|=2, to (1, 5)=|2|+|2|=4, to (5,1)=|2|+|2|=4, to (1,1)=|2|+|2|=4.  \n- LEFT to (2, 2) \u2192 to (2, 4)=|0|+|2|=2, to (1,1)=|1|+|1|=2, to (5,1)=|3|+|1|=4.  \n- RIGHT to (4, 2) \u2192 to (5,1)=|1|+|1|=2, to (2,4)=|2|+|2|=4.  \n\nSo UP and LEFT both put me 2 steps from an apple ((2,4) for both, but UP\u2019s path to (2,4) is through (3,3) then (2,3) then (2,4) or similar). LEFT puts me at (2,2) then (2,3) then (2,4) \u2014 same distance.  \n\n**Future options after each move:**  \n- UP to (3, 3): next turn body at [(3, 3), (3, 2)], tail at (3, 1) gone? Wait, after moving, body grows only if eat apple. I have not eaten apple this turn, so length stays 2: head to (3,3), tail at (3,2), old tail (3,1) disappears. So next turn from (3,3), body at (3,2) so can\u2019t go DOWN to (3,2). Possible moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n- LEFT to (2, 2): body at [(2,2), (3,2)], tail gone from (3,1). Next turn from (2,2), body at (3,2) so can\u2019t go RIGHT to (3,2). Possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n- RIGHT to (4, 2): body at [(4,2), (3,2)], next turn from (4,2), body at (3,2) so can\u2019t go LEFT to (3,2). Possible moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nAll three safe moves give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy at (8, 4) with no body, likely moves toward nearest apple (8,0) or (5,1) or (2,4). (2,4) is far from them, so they\u2019ll probably go DOWN or LEFT. Not a threat to me yet.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI want to collect apples while staying safe. (2,4) is a good target. Moving LEFT now gets me closer to (2,4) and also (1,1) as backup. UP also gets closer to (2,4) but via a less direct path? Actually from (3,3) to (2,4) is LEFT then UP, same as from (2,2) to (2,4) is UP twice. Both fine.  \n\nLEFT also positions me near center-left where more apples are ((1,5), (1,1), (2,4)).  \n\nI\u2019ll choose LEFT to approach (2,4) and keep future options open.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nLEFT",

However, simultaneous movement means if I move RIGHT now into (5, 3), I check current board: enemy body currently occupies (5, 3) \u2192 that\u2019s an immediate collision with enemy body, so RIGHT is **unsafe now** (death).  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN.\n\n---\n\n**Safety check considering enemy movement:**  \nEnemy head at (6, 4). Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP to (6, 5) empty  \n- DOWN to (6, 3) empty  \n- LEFT to (5, 4) its own body (currently at (5, 4)), unsafe  \n- RIGHT to (7, 4) empty  \n\nEnemy can go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\nHead-on collision possible if we move into same cell:  \nMy UP to (4, 4) vs enemy? Enemy can\u2019t reach (4, 4) in one move from (6, 4).  \nMy DOWN to (4, 2) vs enemy? No.\n\nSo both UP and DOWN safe from head-on collision.\n\n---\n\n**Future options after each safe move:**  \n\n1. **UP to (4, 4):**  \nNext moves from (4, 4):  \n- UP (4, 5) empty  \n- DOWN (4, 3) my body (will be at (3, 3) after this turn) \u2014 unsafe  \n- LEFT (3, 4) my body (will be at (2, 4) after this turn) \u2014 unsafe  \n- RIGHT (5, 4) \u2014 enemy body currently at (5, 4), but enemy moves this turn, so next turn (5, 4) could be empty or enemy head. If enemy moves UP/DOWN/RIGHT, (5, 4) becomes empty (since enemy body shifts). So likely safe next turn.  \nSo next turn from (4, 4): UP and RIGHT likely safe, maybe 2 safe moves.\n\n2. **DOWN to (4, 2):**  \nNext moves from (4, 2):  \n- UP (4, 3) my body (will be at (3, 3)) \u2014 unsafe  \n- DOWN (4, 1) empty  \n- LEFT (3, 2) empty  \n- RIGHT (5, 2) enemy body currently at (5, 2), but enemy moves this turn, so next turn (5, 2) could be empty. Likely safe next turn.  \nSo next turn from (4, 2): DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 3 safe moves likely.\n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nApple at (2, 3) is 2 steps away (LEFT then UP from (4, 3) but can\u2019t go LEFT now).  \nApple at (8, 4) is far.  \nApple at (9, 5) far.  \nApple at (0, 8) far.  \nApple at (7, 0) far.\n\nFrom (4, 2), I could go LEFT to (3, 2) then UP to (3, 3) but that\u2019s my body next turn \u2014 careful. Actually, after moving DOWN, my body will be at [(3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5)] plus new head at (4, 2), tail stays at (2, 5). So (3, 3) is my body next turn, so from (4, 2) going LEFT to (3, 2) is fine, then next turn from (3, 2) maybe UP to (3, 3) is body \u2014 so not good.  \n\nBetter to think: DOWN gives more safe moves next turn (3 vs 2 from UP), so better mobility.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy\u2019s likely move:**  \nEnemy at (6, 4) might go for apple at (8, 4) by moving RIGHT to (7, 4). That\u2019s away from me. No immediate threat.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gives fewer safe moves next turn (2).  \nDOWN gives more safe moves next turn (3) and moves toward bottom apples (7, 0) eventually.\n\nI prefer DOWN to keep mobility high.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 2), assess if I can safely approach apple at (2, 3) via (3, 2) \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 (2, 3) or go for bottom apples. Keep distance from enemy, maintain length advantage.\n\nDOWN",

Wait, after moving LEFT, body becomes [(3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3)]? Let\u2019s trace: current body: head (4, 2) \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 (3, 3) \u2192 (3, 4) \u2192 (2, 4). If I move LEFT to (3, 2), new head (3, 2), then body segments shift: old head (4, 2) becomes new segment 2, then (4, 3) segment 3, then (3, 3) segment 4, then (3, 4) segment 5, tail (2, 4) disappears (since length 5, no apple eaten). So body: [(3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)].  \nThus next turn from (3, 2):  \nUP (3, 3) is my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN (3, 1) empty.  \nLEFT (2, 2) empty.  \nRIGHT (4, 2) my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo only 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n3. **RIGHT to (5, 2):**  \nNext turn from (5, 2):  \nBody after move: [(5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)].  \nPossible moves:  \nUP (5, 3) \u2014 currently enemy body at (5, 3), but enemy moves this turn. If enemy goes RIGHT to (8, 4), then (5, 3) becomes empty (enemy body shifts). So likely safe.  \nDOWN (5, 1) empty.  \nLEFT (4, 2) my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT (6, 2) empty.  \nSo likely 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple is (2, 3) from my current (4, 2): distance |4-2|+|2-3|=3 steps.  \nFrom (3, 2) after LEFT, distance to (2, 3) is 2 steps.  \nFrom (4, 1) after DOWN, farther.  \nFrom (5, 2) after RIGHT, farther.  \n\nLEFT gets me closer to apple (2, 3), but reduces next-turn safe moves to 2.  \nRIGHT or DOWN give more mobility next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy will eat apple at (8, 4) and grow to length 5, tying my length. I should eat apple at (2, 3) soon to regain lead. But need safe path: from (3, 2), next turn I can go LEFT to (2, 2), then UP to (2, 3) to eat apple, but must check if (2, 3) is safe next turn \u2014 currently empty, enemy far away.  \n\nRisk: If I go LEFT now, next turn from (3, 2) only DOWN and LEFT safe, so I can go LEFT to (2, 2), then next turn from (2, 2) UP to (2, 3) to eat apple. That works if no enemy blocks.  \n\nBetter to keep mobility: RIGHT or DOWN now, then approach apple later? But apple (2, 3) could be eaten by enemy if they loop around? Enemy is far at (7, 4) \u2192 (8, 4) eating apple, then maybe heads toward (9, 5) next, not toward (2, 3).

Wait, current tail is (3, 3), so after moving, tail stays at (3, 3) until next move when it moves forward? Actually, in Snake, after eating apple, you grow by 1, so tail doesn\u2019t move that turn. Let\u2019s check:  \n\nCurrent body: head (2, 2), then (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3) (tail).  \nIf I move UP to (2, 3) and eat apple: new head (2, 3), old head (2, 2) becomes segment 2, etc., tail (3, 3) stays, and we add a new segment after tail? Actually, growth means after moving, the tail doesn\u2019t move, so new body length 6:  \n[(2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3)] \u2014 tail still (3, 3).  \n\nThat means next turn, tail will move from (3, 3) to wherever segment before it was (4, 3) \u2014 but that\u2019s already occupied? Wait, that\u2019s wrong: In Snake, when you eat, tail stays in place, so the segment before tail in the new list is (4, 3), so next turn tail moves to (4, 3) \u2014 but (4, 3) is currently in the body? Let\u2019s carefully simulate:  \n\nCurrent:  \n0: (2, 2) head  \n1: (3, 2)  \n2: (4, 2)  \n3: (4, 3)  \n4: (3, 3) tail  \n\nMove UP to (2, 3) with apple:  \nNew head (2, 3)  \nPush all segments: new segment 1 = old head (2, 2)  \nnew segment 2 = old segment 1 (3, 2)  \nnew segment 3 = old segment 2 (4, 2)  \nnew segment 4 = old segment 3 (4, 3)  \nnew segment 5 = old segment 4 (3, 3) tail stays  \nnew segment 6 = copy of tail (3, 3) added for growth? No \u2014 growth means tail doesn\u2019t move, so we keep tail at (3, 3) and add a new segment at the end? Actually, in typical Snake, when you eat, you grow by not removing the last segment that turn. So: without apple, tail (3, 3) would be removed, new tail would be (4, 3). With apple, tail stays (3, 3), and we add an extra segment at the end? Wait, that would duplicate (3, 3). That can\u2019t be right.  \n\nBetter to think: movement without apple: head moves to new cell, each segment moves to previous segment\u2019s old position, last segment (tail) is removed. With apple: same but last segment is not removed, so length increases by 1.  \n\nSo without apple: new body = [(2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3)] length 5.  \nWith apple: new body = [(2, 3), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3)] length 6. Yes, that works: old tail (3, 3) becomes segment 5, and segment 4 is (4, 3), so no duplicate.  \n\nSo after eating apple at (2, 3), my body will be:  \n(2, 3) head  \n(2, 2)  \n(3, 2)  \n(4, 2)  \n(4, 3)  \n(3, 3) tail  \n\nThat\u2019s valid.  \n\n---\n\n**Next turn mobility after UP:**  \nFrom (2, 3) next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 4) empty  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 2) my body \u2192 unsafe  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 3) empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 3) my tail (but tail will move if no apple, so maybe safe? Actually, simultaneous movement: tail moves after head moves, so at start of next turn, tail is at (3, 3), if I move RIGHT into (3, 3), that\u2019s my body \u2192 unsafe)  \nSo only UP and LEFT safe next turn if tail stays. But if tail moves because I don\u2019t eat apple next turn, then (3, 3) becomes empty. But we can\u2019t guarantee.  \n\nSafer to check: after eating apple at (2, 3), tail stays at (3, 3) until next move. So next turn from (2, 3), (3, 3) is occupied by my tail, so RIGHT is unsafe. So only 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Alternative: LEFT to (1, 2):**  \nBody becomes: [(1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3)] (tail (3, 3) gone).  \nNext turn from (1, 2):  \nUP (1, 3) empty  \nDOWN (1, 1) empty  \nLEFT (0, 2) empty  \nRIGHT (2, 2) my body \u2192 unsafe  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn, and apple (2, 3) is still close (2 steps away).  \n\n---\n\n**Alternative: DOWN to (2, 1):**  \nBody: [(2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3)] (tail (3, 3) gone).  \nNext turn from (2, 1):  \nUP (2, 2) my body \u2192 unsafe  \nDOWN (2, 0) empty  \nLEFT (1, 1) empty  \nRIGHT (3, 1) empty  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn, but farther from apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy threat to apple (2, 3):**  \nEnemy at (9, 4) is 6 steps away, can\u2019t reach it before me if I go UP now.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gets apple immediately, gives me apple lead (5 vs 4), but reduces next turn\u2019s safe moves to 2.  \nLEFT keeps 3 safe moves next turn and still lets me possibly get apple (2, 3) later, but enemy could move toward it in 2 turns.  \n\nGiven the board is still open, taking apple now seems good to gain lead and force enemy to catch up. Also, with apple lead, I can play more defensively.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (2, 3), my body will be as above. Next turn from (2, 3), safe moves: UP to (2, 4) or LEFT to (1, 3). Prefer UP to go toward center/open area, avoid boxing in.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

Worse.  \n\n3. RIGHT to (4, 7):  \nBody: [(4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 6), (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3)]  \nFrom (4, 7):  \nUP (4, 8) empty  \nDOWN (4, 6) empty  \nLEFT (3, 7) my body \u2192 unsafe  \nRIGHT (5, 7) empty  \n\u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nSo UP and RIGHT give 3 safe moves, DOWN gives 2.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan**  \n\nI want to collect apples (1, 8) and (0, 8) soon.  \nUP gets me closer to those.  \nRIGHT moves me toward center but not toward nearest apples.  \nEnemy is far right side, not an immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Choose best move**  \n\nUP:  \n- Safe  \n- 3 safe moves next turn  \n- Moves toward closest apples  \n- No immediate danger  \n\nRIGHT:  \n- Safe  \n- 3 safe moves next turn  \n- But delays reaching apples  \n\nDOWN:  \n- Reduces mobility  \n\nSo UP is best.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving UP to (3, 8), next turn consider LEFT to (2, 8) to approach apple at (1, 8), but check enemy movement and possible head-on collision risks.

Safe.  \n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Immediate apple proximity**  \n\nClosest apples from (3, 8):  \n- (1, 8): Manhattan distance = |3-1| + |8-8| = 2  \n- (0, 8): distance = 3  \n- (4, 1): distance = 4 (|3-4| + |8-1| = 1+7=8?

Enemy is moving down to (9, 7) and will be far away from the left side.  \n\nRisk: after eating (0, 8), I\u2019ll be at length 9 and in the top-left corner, which could limit escape routes, but I can go DOWN from (0, 8) to (0, 7) to open space.  \n\nUP now avoids immediate growth but delays apple collection and gives fewer safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Decision**  \n\nLEFT is clearly better:  \n- Safe  \n- Gets apple now  \n- Sets up another apple next turn  \n- Enemy not a threat in that area  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (1, 8) and eating apple, next turn go LEFT to (0, 8) to eat second apple unless something unexpected happens. Then from (0, 8) consider DOWN to (0, 7) to avoid trapping in corner. Keep monitoring enemy\u2019s position, but they are far bottom-right now.  \n\nLEFT",

Yes, tail moves from (2,7) to (3,7)? Let\u2019s trace:  \nCurrent body: head (1,5), then (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (3,7), (2,7) tail.  \nAfter moving RIGHT: new head (2,5), then old head (1,5) becomes segment 2, etc., last segment (2,7) is gone, new last segment is (3,7).  \nSo (3,7) and (3,8) remain occupied, (2,7) becomes free.  \n\nThat means (3,5) will be free next turn. So path to (5,5) is clear.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Decision**  \n\nRIGHT gives:  \n- Moves toward closest apple (5,5).  \n- 3 safe moves next turn.  \n- Avoids left column body.  \n- Enemy far away, no collision risk.  \n\nDOWN also safe but moves away from (5,5).  \n\nI\u2019ll choose RIGHT to approach (5,5).  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2,5), go RIGHT to (3,5) if safe, to continue toward apple at (5,5), while checking enemy movement.  \n\nRIGHT",

Choose among UP (to eat apple), LEFT, or RIGHT depending on enemy position.  \n\nUP",

Eating it now means I tie or lead in apples (14 vs enemy 13).  \n\nGiven all safe moves give 2 exits next turn, I should pick the one that keeps more options open after *that*.  \n\nDOWN \u2192 (1, 6) \u2192 next turn only (0, 6) and (2, 6) safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (0, 7) \u2192 next turn only (0, 8) and (0, 6) safe.  \nUP \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 next turn only (1, 9) and (0, 8) safe.  \n\nUP seems slightly better because (1, 9) and (0, 8) are less constrained by my body\u2019s position.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Decision**  \n\nI\u2019ll go UP to (1, 8) to keep a path toward top-left and possibly toward (8, 8) later, and avoid eating apple now which would reduce mobility more.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 8), likely go UP to (1, 9) or LEFT to (0, 8) depending on enemy position.

(4,6) and (7,6) to the right, (8,8) top-right, (1,0) far bottom.  \n\nFrom (1,9) after UP: I can go LEFT to (0,9) then maybe down later toward (8,8) apple eventually.  \nFrom (0,8) after LEFT: I can go UP to (0,9) then similar path, or DOWN to (0,7) then right later.  \n\nBut (8,8) apple is reachable if I go along top row: (0,9) \u2192 (1,9) \u2192 ... \u2192 (8,9) then down to (8,8).  \n\nEnemy is far away at bottom-right.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Which move keeps more options open later?**  \n\nUP to (1,9) \u2192 next turn safe moves LEFT (0,9) or RIGHT (2,9).  \nLEFT to (0,8) \u2192 next turn safe moves UP (0,9) or DOWN (0,7).  \n\n(0,9) is common to both. Difference:  \n- From (1,9), RIGHT (2,9) opens path across top toward (8,8).  \n- From (0,8), DOWN (0,7) leads toward bottom but risks getting trapped by left wall.  \n\nI prefer UP now because (1,9) \u2192 (2,9) next turn keeps me moving toward right side apples while staying near top edge away from enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Long-term note**  \n\nAfter UP to (1,9), next turn likely go RIGHT to (2,9) to start traversing top row toward (8,8) apple. Avoid going down into crowded body area until necessary. Enemy length equal to mine, so apple race matters.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

From (2, 9), going RIGHT repeatedly along top row (3,9), (4,9), \u2026, (8,9) then DOWN to (8,8) is a clear path, but I must survive until then.  \n\n(1,6) apple is blocked by my body at (1,7).  \n(4,6) and (7,6) are reachable later from top-right area.  \n(1,0) is far and risky near enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Which move is less trapping?**  \n\nLEFT to (0, 9) \u2192 only DOWN next turn to (0, 8) \u2192 then from (0, 8) safe moves would be UP (back to 0,9) or DOWN (0,7). That\u2019s cycling near left wall \u2014 could get stuck if enemy approaches.  \n\nRIGHT to (2, 9) \u2192 only RIGHT next turn to (3, 9) \u2192 from (3, 9) safe moves: DOWN (3,8) is my body? Let\u2019s check: body after two moves: head (3,9), then (2,9), (1,9), (1,8), (1,7), (2,7), (2,8), (3,8) \u2014 yes (3,8) is in body, so DOWN unsafe. UP off-board, LEFT into body, so only RIGHT again to (4,9). This forces me along top row \u2014 but top row is clear until x=9, then I can go down toward (8,8) apple.  \n\nSo RIGHT keeps me moving toward apple with a forced but safe path along top edge, away from enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Enemy threat**  \n\nEnemy is at (6,3), moving possibly UP/LEFT/RIGHT. It might go for (7,6) or (4,6) apples. Unlikely to reach top soon.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (2,9), next turn only safe is RIGHT to (3,9). Then again RIGHT to (4,9), etc., along top row until (8,9), then DOWN to (8,8) apple. After eating apple, length increases, tail moves, opening more options. Avoid going down into body until tail clears.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Actually, if enemy eats apple at (8, 8) this turn, then next turn (8, 8) is enemy body \u2014 so I can\u2019t go there.\n\nThus, (8, 8) is likely going to enemy. Better to aim for (9, 9) or other apples.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Long-term safety**\n\nMy current body blocks left side of board heavily. I\u2019m near top edge.

From (9, 9), only DOWN and LEFT safe \u2014 but LEFT would be (8, 9) which will be my body after moving there, so actually from (9, 9) only DOWN safe. That\u2019s a trap.\n\nSo going RIGHT now might lead to dead end at (9, 9) after eating apple.\n\nBetter to go DOWN to (7, 8) \u2014 more central, keep options open, maybe go for (4, 6) or (1, 6) apples later.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Enemy threat**\n\nEnemy at (8, 7) could move UP to (8, 8) (likely for apple), or LEFT to (7, 7) which is closer to me if I go DOWN to (7, 8) \u2014 but no direct collision this turn.\n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (7, 7), then from (7, 8) I\u2019d be above enemy \u2014 safe.\n\n---\n\n**Step 8: Decision**\n\nRIGHT leads toward (9, 9) but risks dead end.  \nDOWN keeps more board access and avoids top-edge trap.\n\nI\u2019ll choose DOWN for safety and flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\nFrom (7, 8), consider moving toward (4, 6) apple via (7, 7) \u2192 (6, 7) etc., or if enemy moves toward (8, 8) apple, I can go right toward center.

However, moving into a cell occupied by an enemy head at start of turn is not allowed \u2014 but at move time, heads move simultaneously, so if enemy moves away, cell becomes free. But if enemy stays, collision. Let\u2019s check: enemy at (8, 8) could move UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. If enemy stays in place, that means enemy chose not to move, so (8, 8) still occupied by enemy head at end of turn \u2192 I die if I go RIGHT into it. So RIGHT is risky: possible death if enemy stays. Safer to avoid unless sure enemy will leave.  \n- So definitely safe: DOWN only. LEFT/UP unsafe, RIGHT risky (possible head-on if enemy stays).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Enemy possible moves from (8, 8):**  \nEnemy safe moves:  \nUP \u2192 (8, 9): '.' safe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (8, 7): '.' safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (7, 8): my head currently there \u2014 if enemy moves LEFT into my starting head position and I move away, no collision? Wait, simultaneous move: if I move DOWN to (7, 7) and enemy moves LEFT to (7, 8), we swap positions, no collision.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9, 8): '.' safe.  \n\nEnemy could also stay in place (not move) but game rules require choosing a direction, so staying in place isn\u2019t allowed \u2014 they must choose a direction, so they will leave (8, 8).  \n\nThus, (8, 8) will be empty at end of turn if enemy moves away. But if enemy chooses LEFT to (7, 8) and I choose DOWN to (7, 7), no problem. If enemy chooses RIGHT to (9, 8) and I choose RIGHT to (8, 8), I end up at (8, 8) and enemy at (9, 8) \u2014 safe.  \n\nSo actually RIGHT might be safe after all, because enemy cannot stay in place. But what if enemy chooses LEFT to (7, 8) and I choose RIGHT to (8, 8)? Then enemy dies because they move into my old head position? No \u2014 my old head position is (7, 8), which becomes empty when I move to (8, 8), so enemy moves into empty cell \u2014 fine.  \n\nBut simultaneous head-to-head collision: if enemy moves RIGHT to (9, 8) and I move RIGHT to (8, 8), no issue. If enemy moves UP to (8, 9) and I move RIGHT to (8, 8), no issue. If enemy moves DOWN to (8, 7) and I move RIGHT to (8, 8), no issue. If enemy moves LEFT to (7, 8) and I move RIGHT to (8, 8), no issue.  \n\nSo RIGHT is actually safe because enemy will not be in (8, 8) at end of turn.  \n\nWait \u2014 but what if two snakes choose same cell? That\u2019s head-on collision. Could enemy choose RIGHT to (9, 8) while I choose RIGHT to (8, 8)? Different cells. Could enemy choose LEFT to (7, 8) while I choose RIGHT to (8, 8)? Different cells. So no head-on.  \n\nSo both DOWN and RIGHT are safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future safety after each safe move:**  \n\n**Option DOWN to (7, 7):**  \nFrom (7, 7):  \nUP \u2192 (7, 8): my body (first segment after move) \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (7, 6): '.' safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (6, 7): '.' safe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (8, 7): '.' safe.  \n3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Option RIGHT to (8, 8):**  \nFrom (8, 8):  \nUP \u2192 (8, 9): '.' safe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (8, 7): '.' safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (7, 8): my body (first segment after move) \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9, 8): '.' safe.  \n3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nBoth give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nApples: (5, 8) is close \u2014 but (5, 8) is currently my body? Wait, check my body list: (5, 8) is not in my body \u2014 yes, it\u2019s an apple. From board: row 8 col 5 is 'A'.  \nFrom (7, 8):  \n- DOWN to (7, 7) then LEFT to (6, 7) then DOWN to (6, 6) then LEFT to (5, 6) then UP to (5, 7) then RIGHT to (5, 8) \u2014 many steps.  \n- RIGHT to (8, 8) then DOWN to (8, 7) then LEFT to (7, 7) then LEFT to (6, 7) etc. \u2014 similar.  \n\nBut (9, 9) apple: from (8, 8), UP to (8, 9) then RIGHT to (9, 9) eats it in 2 turns.  \n\nEnemy at (8, 8) currently \u2014 but enemy will move away. If I go RIGHT to (8, 8), I\u2019m on apple? No, (8, 8) is not an apple. Apples are at (1,6),(4,6),(1,0),(9,9),(5,8). So (8,8) no apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of trapping myself:**  \nGoing RIGHT to (8, 8) puts me closer to top-right corner where (9,9) is, but I can avoid dead ends by not rushing into (9,9) without escape.  \n\nGoing DOWN to (7, 7) opens more central options, maybe toward (4,6) apple.  \n\nEnemy\u2019s possible moves: from (8, 8), they might go for (9,9) apple by going UP then RIGHT, or go DOWN toward (5,8) apple.  \n\nIf enemy goes UP to (8, 9), then (9, 9) is reachable for them in 2 turns. If I go RIGHT to (8, 8), I can go UP to (8, 9) next turn \u2014 but if enemy is at (8, 9) then, head-on risk. So maybe avoid that path.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nDOWN seems safer strategically \u2014 keeps me away from enemy\u2019s likely path to (9,9) and gives more space. RIGHT is safe but could lead to competition for (9,9) with enemy.  \n\nGiven I\u2019m behind in apples (13 vs 15), taking a safer route to collect (4,6) or (1,6) later might be better than fighting for (9,9).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (7, 7), move toward (4,6) via LEFT/DOWN moves, keeping away from enemy\u2019s probable top-right path. Monitor enemy\u2019s position to avoid head-on.  \n\nDOWN",

Check body list: (6, 8) not in my body \u2014 wait, my body: (3, 8) yes, but (6, 8) is '.' actually. Let\u2019s verify board: at row 8 col 6 is 'T'? No, row 8 col 6 is '.' according to board (col 6 row 8 is '.'). Actually, check carefully: Board row 8: \". T T T . A . T T 0\" \u2192 col 6 is '.' (index 6). So (6, 8) is '.' safe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (6, 6): '.' safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (5, 7): '.' safe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7, 7): my body after move \u2192 unsafe.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**RIGHT to (8, 7):**  \nFrom (8, 7):  \nUP \u2192 (8, 8): '.' safe (unless enemy moves there this turn, but next turn it\u2019s empty if enemy left).  \nDOWN \u2192 (8, 6): '.' safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (7, 7): my body after move \u2192 unsafe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9, 7): '.' safe.  \n3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nAll give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity and strategy:**  \n\nApples:  \n- (5, 8) \u2013 from (7, 7), path: LEFT to (6, 7), UP to (6, 8), LEFT to (5, 8) eats in 3 moves.  \n- (4, 6) \u2013 from (7, 7), DOWN to (7, 6), LEFT to (6, 6), LEFT to (5, 6), LEFT to (4, 6) eats in 4 moves.  \n- (1, 6) \u2013 farther.  \n- (9, 9) \u2013 enemy likely heads there if they go UP this turn. If I go RIGHT to (8, 7), then UP to (8, 8), RIGHT to (9, 8), UP to (9, 9) in 3 moves, but enemy might eat it first.  \n\nEnemy is ahead in apples (15 vs 13). If enemy eats (9, 9), they get 16. I need to collect apples safely without confrontation.  \n\n(5, 8) is closest in steps if I go LEFT now.  \n(4, 6) is also reachable via DOWN then LEFT moves.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid enemy path:**  \n\nEnemy at (9, 8) might go UP to (9, 9) or LEFT to (8, 8). If they go LEFT to (8, 8), then (8, 8) is occupied this turn, but I\u2019m not moving there. If they go UP, they\u2019ll be at (9, 9) next turn.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8, 7), I\u2019m closer to enemy\u2019s possible location next turn (8, 8) or (9, 9), increasing risk of head-on later.  \n\nSafer to go DOWN or LEFT to stay central and collect (4, 6) or (5, 8).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Choose move:**  \n\nLEFT to (6, 7) sets up path to (5, 8) apple in 3 moves, avoids enemy\u2019s top-right area.  \nDOWN to (7, 6) sets up path to (4, 6) apple.  \n\nBoth are safe. Let\u2019s pick LEFT because (5, 8) is closer in steps and not in enemy\u2019s immediate path (enemy would have to go LEFT twice to reach it).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (6, 7), move toward (5, 8) via UP then LEFT, while checking enemy\u2019s position to avoid collision. Keep options open to retreat downward if needed.  \n\nLEFT",

Wait, after moving UP, my body will be [(6, 7), (7, 7), \u2026] so (6, 7) is my neck \u2192 unsafe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (5, 8): apple there, safe unless enemy could reach it? Enemy at (8, 9) next turn, can\u2019t reach (5, 8) in 1 move.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7, 8): my body \u2192 unsafe.  \nOnly 1 safe move next turn (LEFT to (5, 8)). That\u2019s risky \u2014 if I go UP now, I\u2019m forced to eat apple at (5, 8) next turn or die.  \n\n**DOWN to (6, 6):**  \nFrom (6, 6):  \nUP \u2192 (6, 7): my body after move \u2192 unsafe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (6, 5): '.' safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (5, 6): '.' safe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7, 6): '.' safe.  \n3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**LEFT to (5, 7):**  \nFrom (5, 7):  \nUP \u2192 (5, 8): apple, safe.  \nDOWN \u2192 (5, 6): '.' safe.  \nLEFT \u2192 (4, 7): '.' safe.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (6, 7): my body after move \u2192 unsafe.  \n3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nSo UP is very limiting (only 1 safe move next turn), DOWN and LEFT keep options open.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity and strategy:**  \n\nApples:  \n- (5, 8) \u2013 from (6, 7), UP then LEFT eats in 2 moves, but UP now forces me into a corridor with only LEFT next turn.  \n- (4, 6) \u2013 from (6, 7), DOWN then LEFT twice eats in 3 moves.  \n- (1, 6) \u2013 far.  \n- (7, 1) \u2013 far.  \n- (1, 0) \u2013 far.  \n\nEnemy is at (9, 9) moving to (8, 9) this turn, far from (5, 8) and (4, 6).  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 7), I can go UP to (5, 8) next turn to eat apple safely, and from (5, 8) I\u2019ll have options (maybe DOWN or LEFT).  \nIf I go DOWN to (6, 6), I can head toward (4, 6) but that\u2019s longer.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid risky traps:**  \n\nUP is too restrictive (only 1 safe move next turn). Better to keep flexibility.  \nLEFT to (5, 7) gives me 3 safe moves next turn, and sets up apple (5, 8) for next turn if I want it.  \nDOWN to (6, 6) also good, but apple is farther.  \n\nGiven enemy is far, securing closest apple while keeping options is wise.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Choose move:**  \n\nLEFT to (5, 7) keeps 3 safe moves next turn, moves toward (5, 8) apple, avoids limiting myself.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (5, 7), consider eating (5, 8) next turn if enemy not near, but check other options too (maybe go DOWN to (5, 6) toward (4, 6) if enemy approaches). Keep flexibility.  \n\nLEFT",
