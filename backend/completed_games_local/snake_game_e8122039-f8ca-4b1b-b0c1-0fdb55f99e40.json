Moving left to (2,7) positions us directly beneath the apple at (2,8) and sets up for the next move to (2,8) in the subsequent turn.\n\nLooking further ahead:\n- Moving left puts us on a path toward that apple.\n- Moving up would keep us away from immediate apples but could be useful later.\n- Moving right is less advantageous because it's away from the apple and doesn't help positioning.\n\nBetween safe options, moving left seems ideal to approach the goal directly.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake at (7,5) and (7,4) is far, so no immediate threat from their direction. Our own body at (3,6) blocks down, which we've already ruled out.\n\nTherefore, the best move appears to be moving left.\n\n**Final decision:**\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "To determine the optimal move, we begin by evaluating the current state of the game:\n\n---\n\n### **Current Game State Summary**\n- **Board Size:** 10x10\n- **Apples (Food):** (0, 3), (7, 9), (1, 4), (8, 9), (2, 8)\n- **Your Snake (ID 0):**\n  - Head: (7, 5)\n  - Body: [(7, 4)]\n  - Apples: 1\n- **Enemy Snake (ID 1):**\n  - Head: (0, 5)\n  - Body: [(1, 5)]\n  - Apples: 1\n- **Hazards:** Likely in row 7 and possibly column 7 (based on board depiction)\n- **Turns Remaining:** 140 (150 - 10 used)\n\n---\n\n### **Move Analysis**\n\n#### **Safe Moves (No Immediate Collision)**\nBased on Battlesnake rules, all four directions are currently **safe** from self-collision and enemy collision. However, we must consider **future safety** and **apple accessibility**.\n\n| Move | Head Position | Apple Proximity | Potential Hazards | Strategic Value |\n|------|---------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| **UP** | (7, 6) | (7, 9) \u2014 4 steps | Potential hazard at y=7 | Reaching (7,9) would increase apple count |\n| **DOWN** | (7, 4) | (1, 4) \u2014 6 steps left, 1 step down | Risk of enemy proximity | Longer path to apple |\n| **LEFT** | (6, 5) | (1, 4) \u2014 5 steps left | Safe path | Indirect path to apple |\n| **RIGHT** | (8, 5) | (8, 9) \u2014 4 steps up | Safe path, no hazards | Direct path to apple |\n\n---\n\n### **Decision Logic**\n\n- **Health Consideration:** Eating apples resets health to 100. Reaching either (7,9) or (8,9) is a strong priority to ensure survivability in future turns.\n- **Enemy Snake Behavior:** The enemy is at (0,5) and could move toward (0,3) or (1,4), which are on the left side of the board. This makes the **right side** of the board more open and less contested.\n- **Hazard Avoidance:** If hazards exist in row 7, moving **UP** would expose your snake to potential health drain. Moving **RIGHT** avoids this risk and leads to a clear path to the apple at (8,9).\n- **Future Flexibility:** Moving **RIGHT** positions your snake in a column with more food options and fewer environmental dangers.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy**\n\n- **Step 1:** Move **RIGHT** to (8,5).\n- **Step 2:** Proceed **UP** to (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), and finally (8,9) to collect the apple.\n- **Step 3:** Once an apple is consumed, consider pivoting to other apples like (2,8) or (7,9) if safe paths exist.\n- **Goal:** Maintain a safe distance from hazards and enemies while maximizing apple collection.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe move **RIGHT** is the safest and most strategic choice. It allows your snake to:\n- Avoid potential hazards in column 7\n- Move toward the unguarded apple at (8,9)\n- Maintain maximum flexibility for future moves\n\n---\n\n**Final Move:**\n\nRIGHT",
