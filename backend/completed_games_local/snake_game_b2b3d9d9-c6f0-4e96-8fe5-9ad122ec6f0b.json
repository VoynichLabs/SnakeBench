This moves me closer to the enemy snake (at 5, 2). If the enemy moves LEFT to (4, 2), we are only one tile apart next turn.\n\n**Strategy and Plan:**\nThe apple at (2, 0) is the closest guaranteed point. Snake #1 is at (5, 2), so moving DOWN to (2, 1) and then (2, 0) is very safe, as the enemy is currently 3 tiles away horizontally and would have to travel across the board to contest that specific apple.

If I move LEFT to (4, 2), I'll be directly below that apple, setting up a good path upward.\n\nMoving UP from (5, 2) to (5, 3) is also reasonable, but moving LEFT positions me better for the (4, 6) apple since I'd be at x=4 already.\n\nThe enemy snake at (2, 2) is unlikely to threaten me if I move LEFT since it's further away. I should focus on reaching the (4, 6) apple efficiently.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT toward (4, 6), then proceed UP to collect it. This gives me a 1-point lead early. After that, assess the board for the next closest apple while maintaining distance from the enemy snake.\n\nLEFT",

After collecting the apple at (4, 6), I can reassess for the next closest apple.\n\n**Long-term Plan for Next Turns:**\nContinue moving UP toward (4, 6).

Closes distance to the apple at (0, 3).\n- DOWN: Moves to (1, -1). **Invalid/Death** (Off-board).\n\nStrategic Comparison:\n- LEFT to (0, 0) puts me in the corner. From (0, 0), the only path to the apple is UP.\n- UP to (1, 1) keeps me more central and allows more flexibility. From (1, 1), I can move LEFT to (0, 1) then UP, or directly UP. \n\nHowever, since (0, 3) is on the edge (x=0), moving toward (0, 1) or (0, 0) eventually is necessary. Moving UP first keeps me slightly further from the enemy's potential path if they decide to come south.\n\nPlan: \nI will move UP to (1, 1), then continue toward the apple at (0, 3). This apple is relatively safe as the enemy snake is currently at (5, 3) and more likely to target the apples in the (4, 6) or (1, 6) area. After securing (0, 3), I will target the (0, 7) or (1, 6) cluster.\n\nUP",

Body: [(3, 7), (4, 7)].\n\nEvaluation of moves:\n- UP: Moves to (0, 7). This eats the apple at (0, 7). It is safe from Snake 1 (Snake 1 is at (3, 8), distance to (0, 7) is 4).\n- DOWN: Invalid move, moves into own body segment (0, 5).\n- RIGHT: Moves to (1, 6). This eats the apple at (1, 6). However, Snake 1's head is at (3, 8). If Snake 1 moves LEFT then DOWN, or DOWN then LEFT, it could potentially challenge this space soon, though not this turn. Moving to (1, 6) is safe this turn, but (0, 7) is a guaranteed apple that keeps me along the edge.\n- LEFT: Invalid move, off-board (X < 0).\n\nStrategy:\nI have two apples very close to my head: (0, 7) and (1, 6). Snake 1 is at (3, 8).\nIf I move UP to (0, 7), I get an apple and my head will be at (0, 7).\nIf I move RIGHT to (1, 6), I get an apple and my head will be at (1, 6).\n\nBy taking (0, 7) first, I secure the furthest-left apple. From (0, 7), I can move RIGHT to (1, 7) and then DOWN to (1, 6) or continue towards (3, 9). Snake 1 is closer to the apples at (3, 9) and (7, 9), so securing the ones on the left edge is my priority.\n\nPlan:\nMove UP to (0, 7) to collect the apple. Then, evaluate if I can safely snag (1, 6) before Snake 1 can intervene.\n\nUP",

I'm directly below the apple at (3, 9), and moving UP will let me collect it immediately. This increases my apple count to 3, matching the enemy snake's 2.

Yes, no obstacles\n   - This moves me closer to (1, 6) apple - only 2 more moves away!\n   - This is a strong move\n\n3. **LEFT** - Move to (0, 9)\n   - Safe? NO - Enemy head is at (0, 9)\n   - Head-on collision = both snakes die\n   - ELIMINATE\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Move to (2, 9)\n   - Safe? YES, (2, 9) is empty (my body moved away)\n   - But this moves me away from the closest apple at (1, 6)\n   - Not optimal\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nDOWN is the clear winner:\n- It's safe (no collisions)\n- It moves me directly toward the (1, 6) apple, the closest reachable apple\n- I can reach (1, 6) in 2 more turns by going DOWN again, then DOWN again\n- The enemy snake at (0, 9) has limited mobility on the top row - it's trapped against the edge\n- By heading down the left side, I can collect the (1, 6) apple and then pivot toward other apples\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- This turn: DOWN to (1, 8)\n- Turn 15: DOWN to (1, 7)\n- Turn 16: DOWN to (1, 6) - collect apple #4\n- After collecting (1, 6), reassess and consider targeting (7, 9) or (8, 8) on the right side\n- Goal: Catch up to enemy's 4 apples and overtake them\n\nDOWN",

          "rationale": "Current status:\n- My head: (0, 9). Body: [(0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5)].\n- Enemy snake (ID 1) head: (1, 9). Body: [(2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)].\n- Apple positions: (1, 6), (3, 3), (7, 9), (1, 2), (8, 8).\n\nEvaluation of moves:\n- RIGHT: Moves to (1, 9). This is a head-on collision with Snake 1 if it stays at (1, 9) or moves into it. Since Snake 1 is currently at (1, 9), this is moving into its head. Dead.\n- UP: Moves to (0, 10). Off-board. Dead.\n- LEFT: Moves to (-1, 9). Off-board. Dead.\n- DOWN: Moves to (0, 8). This is my own body. However, moves are simultaneous. The tail is at (0, 5), and the segment at (0, 8) will move to (0, 9) this turn. Wait, my body segments are (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5). Moving to (0, 8) is a collision with my own body.\n\nWait, check coordinates again:\nHead is (0, 9).\nBody is (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5).\nIf I move DOWN, I hit my neck (0, 8). This is a forbidden backward move.\nIf I move RIGHT, I move to (1, 9). This is where the enemy head is currently located. Since we move simultaneously, if Snake 1 moves to (0, 9), (2, 9), or (1, 8), I would be safe *if* it wasn't for the rule about moving into a snake's body. But wait, if Snake 1 moves *out* of (1, 9), that cell becomes empty? No, the head moves to a new cell.\nIf Snake 1 moves RIGHT to (2, 9), (1, 9) becomes empty unless its body part (2, 9) moves into it. Its body is (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8). So (2, 9) will move to (1, 9).\nTherefore, moving RIGHT to (1, 9) hits Snake 1's body part (2, 9) which is moving into (1, 9).\n\nActually, I have very limited space.\nBoard is 10x10. (0,0) to (9,9).\nHead at (0,9).\nSnake 1 at (1,9).\nIf I move RIGHT, I hit Snake 1.\nIf I move DOWN, I hit myself.\nIs there any other option?\nI just moved UP to (0,9). My head was at (0,8).\nMy body was [(0,7), (0,6), (0,5)].\nWait, if I just moved UP to (0,9) and ate an apple, I grew. My body is now 5 segments total.\nHead: (0, 9), Body: [(0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5)].\nI cannot move UP (off-board), LEFT (off-board), or DOWN (own body).\nThe ONLY move is RIGHT.\nSnake 1 head is at (1, 9). If Snake 1 moves RIGHT to (2, 9), DOWN to (1, 8), or UP (off-board), I might survive moving to (1, 9) IF the cell is vacated. However, Snake 1's body (2, 9) follows the head. So (2, 9) moves to (1, 9).\nWait, if Snake 1 moves, its body (2, 9) moves into (1, 9). Thus (1, 9) is occupied by Snake 1's body this turn.\nThere is a slight chance Snake 1 dies or the sequence allows it. But according to standard rules, moving into (1, 9) while Snake 1's body segment (2, 9) moves there results in death.\nHowever, I have no other choice. DOWN is a certain death (backward). RIGHT is the only legal direction on the board.\n\nRIGHT",
