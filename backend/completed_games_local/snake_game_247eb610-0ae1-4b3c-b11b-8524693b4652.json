The enemy is in the upper right area at (6, 9).\n\n**Safe Move Analysis:**\n\n1. **UP** (3, 3):\n   - This is my body! Moving into my own body = death \u2717\n   - UNSAFE\n\n2. **DOWN** (3, 1):\n   - Within board bounds \u2713\n   - Not my body \u2713\n   - Not enemy snake \u2713\n   - There's an apple at (3, 1)! \u2713\n   - Safe move\n\n3. **LEFT** (2, 2):\n   - Within board bounds \u2713\n   - Not my body \u2713\n   - Not enemy snake \u2713\n   - Safe move\n\n4. **RIGHT** (4, 2):\n   - Within board bounds \u2713\n   - Not my body \u2713\n   - Not enemy snake \u2713\n   - Safe move\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT\n\n**DOWN (3, 1)**:\n- There's an apple directly below at (3, 1)\n- Excellent immediate gain\n- Continues strategy of collecting the lower-left cluster\n- After this, I can move to (4, 1) which also has an apple\n- Keeps me in the productive region\n\n**LEFT (2, 2)**:\n- No immediate apple\n- But (1, 3) is nearby (2 cells away diagonally)\n- Less direct than DOWN\n\n**RIGHT (4, 2)**:\n- No immediate apple\n- Moves away from the concentrated apple cluster\n- Less strategic\n\n**Best Move: DOWN**\n\nThis continues the successful strategy of collecting apples in the lower-left region. The apple at (3, 1) is directly below me, and there are more apples at (4, 1) nearby. The enemy is far away in the upper right, so there's no collision risk.\n\n**Future Strategy Note:**\nContinue collecting the lower-left cluster: (3, 1) \u2192 (4, 1) \u2192 work toward (1, 3), (0, 2). The upper-left region has good apple density. Monitor enemy position and avoid the upper-right area where they are. Currently winning 2-3 in apples, need to catch up and pass the enemy.\n\nDOWN",

There's an apple directly above me at (8, 2), which I can collect immediately. This gains me 1 point and moves me closer to other nearby apples at (7, 2) and (6, 2). The enemy is on the opposite side of the board (left side, upper area), so there's no collision risk.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\nContinue harvesting the right side cluster: (8, 2) \u2192 (7, 2) \u2192 (6, 2). Then consider pivoting left toward the middle-lower apples like (2, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (0, 2) while the enemy focuses on its side. The board is spacious enough that we can avoid head-on collisions if I maintain a predictable harvesting pattern.\n\nUP",

UP to (6, 4) is the best move because:\n- There's an apple at (6, 4) waiting to be collected\n- It extends my lead to 12-8 apples\n- After this, I can continue to (7, 4) and (8, 4) to harvest the nearby apple cluster\n- The enemy is on the left side at (1, 4), far from me\n- No collision risk with the enemy\n- Moving UP keeps me agile and maintains momentum in the high-value apple region\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue harvesting the right-side cluster: (6, 4) \u2192 (7, 4) \u2192 (8, 4). The enemy remains isolated on the left side. After clearing this cluster, assess the board for the next best region (likely the (0, 2), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3) area on the left, or continue right if there are better opportunities). Focus on maintaining my score advantage while staying safe.\n\nUP",

It collects an apple at (8, 4), which:\n- Increases my score to 14 apples (extending my lead to 14-10)\n- Keeps me in the profitable right-side region with more apples nearby: (9, 3), (9, 5), (8, 5)\n- Maintains momentum in apple collection\n- The enemy is still far away on the left side at (1, 2)\n- After this move, I can continue toward (9, 5) or (8, 5) next turn\n\n**Strategy Note for Next Turns:**\nContinue east to collect the remaining apples in the right-side cluster: (9, 3), (9, 5), (8, 5). After that, pivot to other clusters like (5, 8), (4, 8), (7, 7) in the upper region. Enemy is still low-threat on the left side and moving slowly. Focus on maximizing apple collection to increase my lead from 13-10 toward 20+ apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Collecting these would bring my score to 18, further extending my lead over the enemy's 12. DOWN is the optimal choice as it continues a systematic harvesting pattern with multiple apples easily reachable in sequence.\n\n**Plan for Next Turns:**\nContinue DOWN to (9, 4), then to (9, 3) to collect the apple. Continue DOWN to (9, 2) to collect another apple. This will bring my score to 18. After exhausting the right-side cluster, pivot left and upward to collect apples in the (5, 5), (5, 8), (4, 8), (7, 7) region.

My body is heavily concentrated along x=9, x=8, and x=7, which limits my movement options. I need to execute a careful escape route moving left while still collecting apples. After DOWN to (9, 1), I should then move DOWN to (9, 0) or pivot LEFT strategically. The interior apples around (5, 5), (5, 3), (4, 4), (3, 3) are still reachable if I navigate carefully. Enemy is at (2, 1) and moving away, so no immediate threat. Focus on breaking free from the right edge constraint while collecting available apples.\n\nDOWN",

I'm at (9, 0) in the bottom-right corner, and all four directions appear to lead to death:\n- UP goes into my own neck at (9, 1)\n- DOWN goes out of bounds\n- LEFT goes into my body at (8, 0)\n- RIGHT goes out of bounds\n\nWait, let me recheck my body position carefully. My body is: [(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5), (8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (6, 2), (7, 2), (8, 2), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0), (5, 0)]\n\nSo (8, 0) is indeed at index 14 in my body. However, when I move, my tail at (5, 0) will disappear. So after my movement, (5, 0) will no longer be occupied by me.\n\nActually, looking more carefully:\n- LEFT (8, 0): This is currently in my body, but after I move and my tail disappears from (5, 0), will (8, 0) still be in my body? Yes, it's at index 14, well before the tail. So this is still a collision.\n\nLet me verify once more: my tail is (5, 0). If I move LEFT to (8, 0), my new body would be from my current (9, 0) moving to (8, 0) as the head, and the old head (9, 0) becomes the new body, extending all the way to what was my second-to-last segment before the old tail drops off. The segment at (8, 0) would still be in that chain, so it's still a collision.\n\nThis appears to be a trapped situation from my previous move. However, I must make a move. Let me reconsider if any move could work:\n\nThe only potentially viable move is LEFT to (8, 0), but this collides with my body. Every move seems to kill me. Given the rules state I must make a move and cannot win if dead, I should choose the move that at least has a logical path, though all appear fatal.\n\nActually, wait - I need to reconsider the game state more carefully. Perhaps the board state shown is after my last move? Let me check: \"Your snake (ID: 0) - Head: (9, 0)\" confirms my current position.\n\nSince all moves appear fatal, I'll choose LEFT as it's the direction toward the interior of the board where most apples are, even though it appears to be a collision.\n\nLEFT",
