UP -> (6,7) would collide with my own body (the next segment is at (6,7)), so that would be death.\n- Moving LEFT toward the apples on y=6 (at (2,6) and (1,6)) risks sliding into the enemy's downward path (the enemy head is at (4,7) and will likely move to (4,6)). If I try to traverse through (4,6) on a future turn, I risk a head-on collision.\n- Moving RIGHT keeps distance from the enemy and leaves the immediate left-hand apples farther away for now; it also doesn't create an immediate trap.\n- Moving DOWN to (6,5) keeps me on the right side, heads me toward the apple at (5,2) eventually, and avoids the potential head-on collision scenario on the left where the enemy is descending.\n\nPlan (short-term):\n- Stay alive this turn, prioritizing safety and option availability.\n- Head gradually toward the right-side apples or toward the lower-right region, while watching the enemy\u2019s moves to avoid a head-on with (4,6) or getting boxed in.\n- If an opening appears (e.g., the enemy collides with something or moves away), pivot toward nearby apples when feasible.\n\nDecision: DOWN",

The enemy snake is at (6,6), slightly closer to the right edge but also eyeing the left side.\n\nMoving **DOWN** to (4,6) is the optimal strategic move for several reasons:\n1.  **Alignment with Food**: This move places me on the same row (y=6) as the target apples (1,6) and (2,6). This allows me to move directly Left in subsequent turns to collect them efficiently.\n2.  **Distance Advantage**: From (4,6), I am 3 moves away from (1,6) and 2 moves away from (2,6). The enemy is at (6,6), so they are 5 and 4 moves away respectively. I will reach these apples first.\n3.  **Safety**: The cell (4,6) is currently empty. Moving Down puts me 2 squares away from the enemy head, which is a safe distance. It also moves me away from my own tail at (4,8), reducing any risk of self-collision.\n4.  **Board Control**: Occupying y=6 on the left side of the board allows me to establish presence there before the enemy can navigate around.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove Left along row 6 to eat the apples at (2,6) and then (1,6). Monitor the enemy's movements from (6,6); if they move Left, ensure there is sufficient space to avoid a head-on collision, though I currently have the path priority.\n\nDOWN",

It moves me along the bottom edge of the board, distancing my head from my vertical body column at `x=1` and keeping me far from the enemy snake.

Neither my body nor the enemy's body occupies this space.\n    *   **Strategy:** This move moves me directly towards the closest apple at (4, 5). The distance is 3 steps: (4, 2) \u2192 (4, 3) \u2192 (4, 4) \u2192 (4, 5). The path (4, 3) and (4, 4) appears clear of obstacles. This is a strong positive move.\n\n2.  **DOWN (to 4, 1):**\n    *   **Safety:** My body occupies (4, 1).\n    *   **Result:** Fatal collision. **Invalid.**\n\n3.  **LEFT (to 3, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** The cell (3, 2) is empty.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moving left increases the distance to the apple at (4, 5) and moves away from the cluster of apples on the right side. While safe, it is not strategically optimal compared to moving towards the food.\n\n4.  **RIGHT (to 5, 2):**\n    *   **Safety:** The cell (5, 2) is empty.\n    *   **Strategy:** Moving right places me adjacent to my body at (5, 1). While not an immediate collision, it reduces my maneuverability because moving left or down from (5, 2) in the future would immediately hit my own body. Moving UP to (4, 3) provides a clearer corridor with more options.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving UP is the best choice. It is safe, moves directly towards the closest apple at (4, 5), and maintains open space for future maneuvering. The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to this path.\n\nUP",
