Monitor enemy snake 1\u2019s movement (x=0 area): current x-distance (post-proposed move) is 6 (vs enemy x=0) \u2192 still \u22655, but x=0 apples (0,8, 0,6) remain far in y-coordinate, so maintain focus on mid-board apples (3,4, 5,4) over x=0 targets.\n3. Post-current move, continue incremental left shifts toward the closer mid-board apple (5,4) while keeping up/down follow-up options open to avoid being boxed in by future body segments; avoid moving down toward own future body segments unless no other 3-option moves exist.\n4. Re-evaluate the (8,2) apple\u2019s safety only after securing a mid-board apple; if unclaimed and follow-up moves from its vicinity are available, target it next.\n5. If enemy snake 1 shifts toward mid-board (x increases beyond 2), re-assess mid-board apple safety to avoid head-on collisions during our leftward advance.\n\nNow, detailed safe move analysis:\n1. List all four directions and eliminate fatal moves:\n   - LEFT: New head (6,4) (on-board, no self/enemy body collision) \u2192 safe.\n   - UP: New head (7,5) (on-board, no self/enemy body collision) \u2192 safe.\n   - DOWN: New head (7,3) is our snake\u2019s current body segment \u2192 self-collision \u2192 eliminated.\n   - RIGHT: New head (8,4) (on-board, no self/enemy body collision) \u2192 safe.\n2. Assess remaining safe moves for follow-up flexibility and apple proximity:\n   - All three safe moves (LEFT, UP, RIGHT) preserve 3 follow-up options (meets core flexibility requirement per long-term plan).\n   - LEFT is the only safe move that incrementally shifts toward the closer mid-board apple (5,4) (aligns with plan to prioritize mid-board targets), while UP/RIGHT move away from these high-priority apples.\n   - No safe move poses head-on collision risk with enemy snake 1 (x=0 area is too far from proposed new heads (6,4), (7,5), (8,4)).\n3. Conclusion: LEFT balances maximum flexibility and progress toward reachable, high-priority apples without hidden risks.\n\nLEFT",

That leaves no legal move on the following turn and results in certain death shortly after eating that apple.\n- That is an avoidable forced trap, so taking the immediate apple is unsafe.\n\nChoice and short plan:\n- Move RIGHT to (3,9). This keeps multiple follow-up options (down into open space or continue right along the top), avoids the immediate trap, and preserves flexibility to head later toward apples at (1,6), (3,4) or (8,7)/(8,2) depending on how the enemy moves.\n- Next turns: reassess after opponent moves; prefer routes that keep 2+ escape options and only take apples when doing so doesn't lead to immediate entrapment.\n\nRIGHT",

Assess follow-up flexibility and target alignment:\n   - All safe moves meet \u22653 follow-up options (core requirement), but RIGHT maximizes target alignment (immediate apple consumption) and post-consumption follow-up flexibility (3 safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT from (8,2)).\n   - Enemy 1\u2019s x-coordinate remains 2 (no \u22653 threshold hit), so no need to abandon (8,2) target per prior plan; no head-on collision risk (enemy head (2,9) is too distant).\n\nRIGHT",

DOWN to (1,5) preserves 3 exits next turn and positions me to approach the (3,4)/(3,0) apples safely.\n\nShort plan for next turns: from (1,5) head toward (3,4) (e.g., RIGHT then DOWN/RIGHT), collect that apple(s), and avoid getting boxed by my own body; if the top apple at (1,9) becomes safe to approach, loop back later.\n\nDOWN",

From new head (3,6) (if DOWN is chosen), next turn priority is to preserve \u22653 follow-up options while moving leftward toward x=0 to advance access to the (0,6) mid-term target.\n3. Enemy 1 head (6,8) still within x=3-8, y=2-7 circling range (no expansion trigger hit); continue monitoring for x>8 or y>5 shifts to update boundary parameters (enemy\u2019s possible DOWN move to (6,7) brings them closer to y=6 but remains x-separated, low collision risk).\n4. Apples assessment: (1,9) still has insufficient follow-up options (reject); (0,6) becomes more accessible now that y=6 alignment is achieved (top mid-term priority); defer (0,1), (3,0), (4,0) due to low maneuverability/collision risk; confirm (0,6) path viability via leftward progression.\n5. Body length: If growing beyond 6 via apple consumption, retain \u22653 follow-up options check; avoid x\u22659 and y\u22641 to preserve escape paths.\n6. Next turn priority (if DOWN is chosen): Evaluate (3,6) follow-up moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) for \u22653 options, prioritize leftward shifts to progress toward (0,6) without compromising maneuverability.\n\nDetailed move analysis for current turn:\n1. Eliminate fatal moves:\n   - UP: New head (3,8) collides with own body (direct rear segment) \u2192 fatal, eliminated.\n2. Assess remaining safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) against core \u22653 follow-up options rule:\n   - LEFT: New head (2,7) only has 1 follow-up option (DOWN) \u2192 violates core requirement, eliminated.\n   - DOWN: New head (3,6) has 3 follow-up options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) \u2192 meets core requirement; no collision risk, achieves y=6 alignment (critical for (0,6) access).\n   - RIGHT: New head (4,7) has 3 follow-up options (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) \u2192 meets core requirement but moves further from (0,6)\u2019s x=0 target (no strategic benefit).\n3. Tiebreaker evaluation (DOWN vs. RIGHT):\n   - Both avoid enemy head-on collisions (enemy\u2019s possible new heads do not overlap with either candidate head).\n   - DOWN progresses toward (0,6) mid-term target by reaching y=6, while RIGHT retains y=7 position (further from target and increases distance from leftward path viability).\n4. Final selection: DOWN aligns core follow-up requirements with mid-term target progress and future maneuverability.\n\nDOWN",
