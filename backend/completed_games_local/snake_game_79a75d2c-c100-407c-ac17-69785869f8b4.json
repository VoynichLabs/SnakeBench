Possible moves from (5,6):**  \n- UP \u2192 (5,7)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,5)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,6)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,6)\n\n---\n\n**2. Eliminate deadly moves:**  \n- UP (5,7): empty, inside board, safe.  \n- DOWN (5,5): empty, safe.  \n- LEFT (4,6): has an apple there. No snake body there currently, safe.  \n- RIGHT (6,6): empty, safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe because no snake body exists anywhere yet, and all are within board.\n\n---\n\n**3. Strategic preference:**  \nWe want to move toward apples while preserving future options.  \nClosest apples to (5,6):  \n- (4,6) is 1 step left (contains apple).  \n- (5,1) is 5 steps down.  \n- (7,3) is distance 5.  \n- (0,3) far.  \n- (7,0) far.\n\nEating an apple now will grow us to length 2 next turn, which reduces future safe moves slightly (can\u2019t reverse into own body). But early growth is good for score and to block enemy later.\n\nLEFT to (4,6) gets an apple immediately. That\u2019s good for score. Is it safe next turn?  \nAfter eating apple at (4,6), my body will be [(4,6), (5,6)] next turn (head at (4,6), tail at (5,6)). Then possible moves from (4,6): UP (4,7), DOWN (4,5), LEFT (3,6), RIGHT (5,6) \u2014 but (5,6) is my body then, so RIGHT is unsafe. So I\u2019d have 3 moves next turn, still okay.\n\n---\n\n**4. Consider enemy movement:**  \nEnemy head at (1,0). Possible moves: UP (1,1), DOWN (1,-1) invalid, LEFT (0,0), RIGHT (2,0).  \nDOWN off board \u2192 invalid. So enemy will choose UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. They might go toward apple at (0,3) via UP-left moves, but they\u2019re far from me. No risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\n---\n\n**5. Which move is best?**  \nLEFT gets apple immediately, increases score to 1, and doesn\u2019t put me in obvious danger.  \nOther moves (UP/DOWN/RIGHT) don\u2019t get apple now, but keep options open equally well. However, early apple advantage is useful.\n\nNo risk of dying by going LEFT. Let\u2019s check:  \nEnemy won\u2019t reach (4,6) in one move from (1,0). So safe.\n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nWe\u2019ll have body length 2, tail at old head (5,6). Need to avoid reversing into it. Move toward other apples, maybe (5,1) or (7,3), while keeping distance from enemy until longer.\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Check for immediate death in other moves:**  \n- UP (4, 7): within board, not occupied by any snake body (enemy has no body yet).  \n- DOWN (4, 5): within board, empty.  \n- LEFT (3, 6): within board, empty.  \n\nAll three moves are safe from self-collision and staying in bounds.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Consider enemy movement and head-on collisions:**  \nEnemy head at (0,0). Possible moves:  \n- UP (0,1)  \n- LEFT (-1,0) invalid (off board)  \n- RIGHT (1,0)  \n- DOWN (0,-1) invalid.  \n\nSo enemy will be at (0,1), (1,0), or (0,0)? Wait, they must move; staying still isn\u2019t allowed. So their possible heads next turn: (0,1) or (1,0).  \n\nNone of my possible moves (4,7), (4,5), (3,6) will coincide with (0,1) or (1,0), so no head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Apple proximity and strategic value:**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (3,4) is 2 steps away (down-left from me)  \n- (5,1) is 5 steps away  \n- (7,3) is distance 5  \n- (0,3) far  \n- (7,0) far  \n\nFrom (4,6):  \n- LEFT (3,6) \u2192 then next turn could go DOWN to (3,5) \u2192 closer to apple (3,4).  \n- DOWN (4,5) \u2192 then next turn could go LEFT to (3,5) \u2192 same distance to (3,4).  \n- UP (4,7) \u2192 moves away from most apples.  \n\nBest for apple gathering: LEFT or DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Future mobility:**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (3,6): body will be [(3,6), (4,6), (5,6)?] Wait, we ate an apple last turn, so we grew. Yes: length is 2 now (head + 1 body segment). After moving without eating apple, tail moves, so body next turn: head at new position, then (4,6) as body, tail (5,6) disappears. Actually let\u2019s check:  \nCurrent: head (4,6), body [(5,6)], total length 2.  \nIf we move without eating apple, tail moves forward, so new body: head at new position, body = [(4,6)], length still 2.  \n\nSo from (3,6) next turn, possible moves: UP (3,7), DOWN (3,5), LEFT (2,6), RIGHT (4,6) \u2014 but (4,6) will be my body next turn, so not allowed. So 3 moves.  \n\nFrom (4,5) next turn: body = [(4,6)], so possible moves: UP (4,6) body \u2192 no, DOWN (4,4), LEFT (3,5), RIGHT (5,5). That\u2019s 3 moves too.  \n\nFrom (4,7) next turn: body = [(4,6)], so possible moves: UP (4,8), DOWN (4,6) body \u2192 no, LEFT (3,7), RIGHT (5,7). That\u2019s 3 moves.  \n\nAll give same mobility next turn (3 moves).  \n\n---\n\n**6. Plan for next few turns:**  \nI want to target (3,4) apple.  \nOption A: LEFT now to (3,6), then DOWN to (3,5), then DOWN to (3,4) to eat apple.  \nOption B: DOWN now to (4,5), then LEFT to (3,5), then DOWN to (3,4).  \n\nBoth are same length. But LEFT now keeps me farther from enemy (who is at bottom left). DOWN moves me closer to enemy\u2019s possible positions, though still far away.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose LEFT to stay in safer area and approach apple (3,4) in 2 turns.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nWe are heading to (3,4) apple. Next turn from (3,6) go DOWN to (3,5), then DOWN to (3,4) to eat. Watch enemy movement toward (0,3) apple\u2014they may move up. Keep distance.  \n\nLEFT",

Future mobility after each move:**  \nIf I move DOWN to (3, 5): body becomes [(3, 6)] (tail moves).  \nNext turn from (3, 5): possible moves UP (3, 6) body \u2192 no, DOWN (3, 4) apple, LEFT (2, 5), RIGHT (4, 5) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 6): body becomes [(3, 6)].  \nNext turn from (2, 6): UP (2, 7), DOWN (2, 5), LEFT (1, 6), RIGHT (3, 6) body \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nIf I move UP to (3, 7): body becomes [(3, 6)].  \nNext turn from (3, 7): UP (3, 8), DOWN (3, 6) body, LEFT (2, 7), RIGHT (4, 7) \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nAll give same immediate future mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Plan for next few turns:**  \nI want apple (3, 4) in 2 turns. DOWN now is most direct.  \nEnemy is far away at (0, 1) and likely heading toward (0, 3) apple or staying low. No immediate threat.  \n\nAfter eating apple at (3, 4), I\u2019ll be length 3 and can consider targeting (7, 3) or (5, 1) next.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 5) next turn, go DOWN to (3, 4) to eat apple. Then from (3, 4) with length 3, consider moving toward (7, 3) via RIGHT moves, but watch enemy\u2019s progress toward (0, 3). Keep distance.  \n\nDOWN",

Check for immediately deadly moves from (5, 2):**  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 3): occupied by my body \u2192 deadly.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 1): empty currently (apple there).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 2): empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 2): empty.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**2. Enemy possible moves from (1, 6):**  \nFrom (1, 6), enemy\u2019s body at (1, 5).  \nPossible enemy moves:  \n- UP (1, 7): empty  \n- DOWN (1, 5): body \u2192 deadly  \n- LEFT (0, 6): empty  \n- RIGHT (2, 6): empty  \nEnemy\u2019s safe heads next turn: (1, 7), (0, 6), (2, 6).  \n\n**3. Head-on collision check:**  \nMy possible next heads: (5, 1), (4, 2), (6, 2).  \nEnemy possible next heads: (1, 7), (0, 6), (2, 6).  \nNo overlap \u2192 no immediate head-on risk.  \n\n**4. Apple distances from my head (5, 2):**  \n- (5, 1): Manhattan distance = 1  \n- (7, 3): distance = |5-7|+|2-3| = 2+1=3  \n- (7, 0): distance = 2+2=4  \n- (8, 6): distance = 3+4=7  \n- (1, 8): distance = 4+6=10  \n\nClosest is (5, 1) at distance 1.  \n\n**5. Evaluate safe moves:**  \n\n**DOWN to (5, 1):**  \n- Apple (5, 1) is there \u2192 I eat apple, grow to length 4.  \n- Future from (5, 1) after eating: body = [(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)]  \n- Next turn from (5, 1): UP (5, 2) body \u2192 deadly, DOWN (5, 0) empty, LEFT (4, 1) empty, RIGHT (6, 1) empty \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\n**LEFT to (4, 2):**  \n- No apple.  \n- Future from (4, 2): body = [(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)]  \n- Next turn from (4, 2): UP (4, 3) empty, DOWN (4, 1) empty, LEFT (3, 2) empty, RIGHT (5, 2) body \u2192 deadly \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n**RIGHT to (6, 2):**  \n- No apple.  \n- Future from (6, 2): body = [(5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)]  \n- Next turn from (6, 2): UP (6, 3) empty, DOWN (6, 1) empty, LEFT (5, 2) body \u2192 deadly, RIGHT (7, 2) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n**6. Risk vs reward:**  \nDOWN gets me an apple now, but leaves me with only 2 safe moves next turn (trapped? Not exactly trapped, but fewer options).  \nLEFT/RIGHT give no apple but keep 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nEnemy is far away, so immediate danger low.  \nEating apple now helps score and grow, but must check if DOWN then next turn is survivable. From (5, 1) after eating, safe moves are DOWN (5, 0) and LEFT (4, 1) and RIGHT (6, 1) \u2014 actually I miscounted: UP is body, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2192 3 safe moves, not 2. Let\u2019s recalc:  \nBody after eating apple: head moves to (5, 1), new segment added at old tail position? Wait \u2014 snake growth: when you eat an apple, your tail doesn\u2019t move that turn, so next turn your body will be: head at (5, 1), then (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4). So from (5, 1), UP to (5, 2) is body \u2192 deadly. DOWN (5, 0), LEFT (4, 1), RIGHT (6, 1) \u2192 3 safe moves. Yes, so 3 safe moves after eating. That\u2019s fine.  \n\nSo DOWN is safe now and gets apple.  \n\n**7. Long-term thinking:**  \nApple (7, 3) is also close after moving LEFT/RIGHT, but (5, 1) is closest now. Eating it gives length 4, slightly more survivability later. Enemy is not threatening my path.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose DOWN to secure apple.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5, 1), avoid going UP into own body. Prefer DOWN to (5, 0) if safe, or sideways toward other apples like (7, 0) or (7, 3). Keep an eye on enemy #0 heading possibly toward (1, 8) apple.  \n\nDOWN",

My body cells: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). (6,2) not in that list.  \n- Not enemy body? Enemy body: (1,7), (1,6). No.  \n- Could enemy head collide here? Enemy head at (1,8). Could it move to (6,2) in one move? No, too far. So no immediate head-on collision risk.  \nUP seems safe.  \n\nRIGHT \u2192 (7,1) \u2013 safe?  \n- In bounds.  \n- Not my body (body at (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)).  \n- Not enemy body.  \n- Enemy head at (1,8) can\u2019t reach (7,1) in one move.  \n- But (7,1) is adjacent to apple at (7,0) and (7,3) not immediate but close.  \nActually RIGHT seems safe too.  \n\nDOWN \u2192 (6,0) \u2013 safe?  \n- In bounds.  \n- Not my body.  \n- Not enemy body.  \n- Safe from enemy head collision (too far).  \nSafe.  \n\nLEFT \u2192 (5,1) \u2013 safe?  \n- (5,1) is my own body segment (first segment behind head). Moving left = moving backwards into own body \u2192 death. So LEFT is **not safe**.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, RIGHT, DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Which is best for apples and future options?**  \n\nApples:  \n- (7,0): from (6,1), DOWN gets us to (6,0), then need RIGHT to (7,0) next turn if still there.  \n- (7,3): from (6,1), UP to (6,2), then RIGHT to (7,2), then UP to (7,3) in 3 moves.  \n- (4,4): far, not urgent.  \n- (3,1): from (6,1), LEFT unsafe, so need to go around.  \n- (8,6): far.  \n\nClosest apple by Manhattan distance:  \n(7,0): dist = |6-7| + |1-0| = 1+1 = 2  \n(7,3): dist = |6-7| + |1-3| = 1+2 = 3  \n(3,1): dist = 3+0 = 3 but blocked by my body path.  \n\nSo (7,0) is closest. To get closer to it:  \nFrom (6,1), DOWN to (6,0) puts us 1 step away (RIGHT to apple).  \nRIGHT to (7,1) also puts us 1 step away (DOWN to apple).  \n\nWhich is safer next turn?  \n\nIf DOWN to (6,0): next moves from (6,0) would be LEFT (5,0), RIGHT (7,0), UP (6,1).  \n- UP (6,1) is original head pos but now empty? Actually body will move forward, so (6,1) will be empty next turn except if enemy moves there. Enemy at (1,8) can\u2019t reach in one turn, so UP from (6,0) is likely safe.  \n- RIGHT (7,0) is apple cell.  \n- LEFT (5,0) is safe unless enemy moves there (impossible this turn).  \n\nIf RIGHT to (7,1): next moves from (7,1) are LEFT (6,1), RIGHT (8,1), UP (7,2), DOWN (7,0 apple).  \nAll seem safe next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Avoid dead ends / maximize future options**  \n\nCheck board corners: We\u2019re near bottom edge but not trapped.  \n\nEnemy snake at (1,8) is far away, so no immediate threat of head-on collision.  \n\nChoosing DOWN (6,0) \u2192 next turn apple at (7,0) still likely there unless enemy gets it (unlikely given distance).  \nChoosing RIGHT (7,1) \u2192 next turn can go DOWN to (7,0) for apple or explore.  \n\nBoth seem fine. But RIGHT gives more central position with more open space (right side less constrained by left wall and my own body). My body will be at (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1) after I move? Wait, if I move RIGHT to (7,1), my body shifts: new head (7,1), then segments: old head (6,1) becomes segment 1, (5,1) segment 2, (5,2) segment 3, tail (5,3) disappears if no apple eaten. So body: [(7,1), (6,1), (5,1), (5,2)] \u2014 tail gone from (5,3). That opens up space.  \n\nRIGHT seems better for future options because:  \n- It moves toward right side apples (7,0) and (7,3) and (8,6).  \n- It avoids going to bottom row immediately (more trapped if down then left/right limited).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Plan for next turns**  \n\nPlan: Get apple at (7,0) soon, then (7,3), avoid boxing self in right wall, keep enemy in mind later.  \n\nGiven safe moves: UP, RIGHT, DOWN, I think RIGHT is best now.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

My snake state**  \n- Head: (7, 2)  \n- Body: [(7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1)]  \n- Apples collected: 3  \n- Enemy snake (#0) head at (0, 7), body: [(0, 8), (1, 8)], apples: 2  \n\n**2. Apples on board**  \n(7, 0), (7, 3), (8, 6), (4, 4), (3, 1)  \n\n**3. Check each possible move for immediate death**  \n- **UP** \u2192 (7, 3)  \n  - On board? Yes.  \n  - Into my own body? No \u2014 my body is at (7,1), (6,1), (5,1). (7,3) is empty.  \n  - Into enemy body? Enemy body at (0,8), (1,8), (0,7) is head \u2014 not in (7,3).  \n  - Safe from head-on collision? Enemy head at (0,7) cannot reach (7,3) in one move.  \n  - **Safe**.  \n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (7, 1)  \n  - Into my own body? Yes \u2014 my body segment at (7,1) is directly behind my head. This is moving backwards into my own body \u2014 death.  \n  - **Not safe**.  \n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (6, 2)  \n  - On board? Yes.  \n  - Into my own body? No \u2014 body at (6,1) is not (6,2).  \n  - Into enemy body? No.  \n  - Head-on collision? Enemy at (0,7) cannot reach (6,2) in one move.  \n  - **Safe**.  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8, 2)  \n  - On board? Yes.  \n  - Into my own body? No.  \n  - Into enemy body? No.  \n  - Head-on collision? No.  \n  - **Safe**.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN kills me.  \n\n**4. Strategic considerations**  \n- Apple at (7, 3) is directly above me \u2014 moving UP eats it immediately, growing to length 5.  \n- Apple at (7, 0) is below, but I can\u2019t go DOWN now.  \n- Apple at (8, 6) is far, (4, 4) and (3, 1) are also reachable later.  \n- Enemy is far away, no immediate threat.  \n\nUP is tempting because:  \n1. Immediate apple gain (score advantage).  \n2. After eating, my new head at (7, 3), body becomes [(7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), (5, 1)] \u2014 length 5.  \n3. From (7, 3), next moves: could go LEFT to (6, 3), RIGHT to (8, 3), UP to (7, 4), DOWN to (7, 2) (but that\u2019s into my new neck \u2014 not allowed next turn). So 3 possible directions after UP+apple.  \n\nLEFT from (7, 2) to (6, 2):  \n- No apple.  \n- From (6, 2), next moves: UP to (6, 3), DOWN to (6, 1) (body \u2014 no), LEFT to (5, 2), RIGHT to (7, 2) (neck \u2014 no). So 2 possible moves next turn.  \n\nRIGHT from (7, 2) to (8, 2):  \n- No apple.  \n- From (8, 2), next moves: UP to (8, 3), DOWN to (8, 1), LEFT to (7, 2) (neck \u2014 no), RIGHT to (9, 2). So 3 possible moves next turn.  \n\nUP gives apple + 3 next options. RIGHT gives no apple but 3 next options. LEFT gives no apple and only 2 next options.  \n\n**5. Long-term plan note for next turn**  \nIf I go UP and eat apple at (7, 3), next turn avoid DOWN into (7, 2) (neck). Consider moving toward (8, 6) apple via RIGHT then UP, or (4, 4) via LEFT then DOWN. Keep distance from enemy, maintain space.  \n\n**Final choice:** UP gives immediate score gain and keeps good future mobility.  \n\nUP",
