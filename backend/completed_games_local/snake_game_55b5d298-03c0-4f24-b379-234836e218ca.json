I should avoid being trapped in bottom right corner.  \n\nBetter to keep mobility high. Eating apple now is good, but being at edge reduces options. However, (8, 0) apple is easy to take, and next turn I can go LEFT or RIGHT from (8, 0) to avoid being stuck.  \n\nActually, from (8, 0), next turn LEFT to (7, 0) or RIGHT to (9, 0) are safe, and UP back to (8, 1) is safe (empty then).

Wait, check: last turn enemy had length 8, apples 7. Now apples 8, so enemy ate an apple last turn (probably at (6,4) apple).

I need to eat apples to catch up, but must stay safe.  \nNearby apples: (3,1) is close to (4,0) after LEFT move, but I\u2019d be at (4,0) with only 2 moves next turn \u2014 risky if enemy approaches.  \n(5,5), (5,6), (5,8), (5,9) are vertically above me \u2014 if I go UP now, I can aim for those later.  \n\nAlso, my body occupies right side (x=6-8, y=0-4), so moving LEFT opens space on left side.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy\u2019s likely move:**  \nEnemy at (6,4) might go UP to (6,5) toward apples (5,6) or (5,5), or LEFT to (5,4) toward (5,5) apple. Either way, it\u2019s moving away from me for now.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gives more options next turn and moves toward vertical apples. LEFT reduces mobility.  \n\nI\u2019ll go UP to keep flexibility and move toward apple-rich area (y=5-9).  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (5,1), consider moving toward (5,5) apple, but watch enemy\u2019s position to avoid head-on.  \n\nUP",

But enemy is far.  \n  So all 4 moves safe next turn if (2, 3) stays apple (no snake body there now). Wait \u2014 enemy body at (3, 3) and (4, 3), not (2, 3).

I can eat apples on left side.  \nIf I go LEFT now, I eat apple at (0, 2) and grow, but next turn I\u2019m at left edge with only UP, DOWN, RIGHT safe. That\u2019s okay, but maybe better to go UP now to (1, 3), then next turn I can go LEFT to (0, 3) or RIGHT to (2, 3) apple, keeping more space.  \n\nActually, (2, 3) apple is still there now \u2014 but if I go UP now, I don\u2019t eat it yet, but I can eat it next turn from (1, 3) by going RIGHT. That gives me two apples in two turns (none now, one next turn) vs one apple now (LEFT) and maybe fewer later.  \n\nBut enemy might eat (2, 3)? Enemy at (5, 9) \u2192 (2, 3) is 7 Manhattan away, so 2 turns min for enemy to reach it. I can get there in 2 turns if I go UP now, RIGHT next.  \n\nSo:  \nUP now \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 next turn RIGHT to (2, 3) apple.  \nLEFT now \u2192 (0, 2) apple now \u2192 next turn maybe UP to (0, 3) then later (0, 4) apple.  \n\nBoth okay. But UP gives more flexibility after this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nI\u2019ll take UP to keep mobility high and still be able to get (2, 3) apple next turn.  \n\nUP",

Taking the apple now with LEFT risks trapping myself next turn. Better to stay mobile and aim for apple soon but safely.  \n\nRIGHT now keeps options open, maybe aim for (7, 1) or (6, 7) later.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT",

That\u2019s tempting, but after eating apple at (3, 1), my body will grow and tail will stay at (2, 1) for a while, possibly blocking (2, 1) and (2, 2) area.  \n\nDOWN to (4, 1) gives 4 safe moves next turn, and one is LEFT to apple (3, 1) as well. So DOWN gives same apple access next turn but more options if I choose not to take apple immediately.  \n\nRIGHT moves away from apples and toward enemy body area.  \n\nBest choice: DOWN to (4, 1) \u2192 next turn go LEFT to (3, 1) for apple, unless enemy moves into that area (unlikely this turn).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 1), consider LEFT to (3, 1) apple if safe, else UP or DOWN to stay flexible. Avoid moving right into (5, 1) unless necessary, since enemy body is near (5, 3) and (6, 3).  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Tail will move when we move next turn because we ate apple now, so tail stays at (2, 2) one more turn. Actually, after eating apple at turn 30, tail stays at (2, 2) until turn 31\u2019s move completes. So (2, 2) is occupied next turn. Avoid (2, 2) next turn.  \n\nSo from (3, 1) next turn, safe moves: UP (3, 2), DOWN (3, 0), LEFT (2, 1), RIGHT (4, 1).  \n(2, 3) is up then left from (3, 2), but (2, 2) is body, so can\u2019t go directly from (3, 2) to (2, 2).

Wait: tail was (1, 3) before move, after moving head to (1, 2), tail becomes (1, 3)? Let\u2019s check:  \n  Original body: head (1,1), then (2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(4,2),(4,3),(3,3),(3,4),(2,4),(1,4),(1,3) tail.  \n  Move UP: new head (1,2), then old head (1,1) becomes segment 2, etc., last segment (1,3) is removed (tail moves forward). So new body: (1,2),(1,1),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(4,2),(4,3),(3,3),(3,4),(2,4),(1,4). Tail is (1,4).  \n  So (1,3) is empty now.  \n  So from (1, 2) next turn:  \n  UP (1, 3) \u2014 empty.  \n  DOWN (1, 1) \u2014 body segment 2 \u2192 invalid.  \n  LEFT (0, 2) \u2014 apple at (0, 2) \u2192 yes.  \n  RIGHT (2, 2) \u2014 empty.  \n  \u2192 3 safe moves, one leads to apple (0, 2).  \n\n- **DOWN to (1, 0):**  \n  After moving, body: (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4) \u2014 tail (1, 4).  \n  Next turn from (1, 0):  \n  UP (1, 1) \u2014 body segment 2 \u2192 invalid.  \n  DOWN off board \u2192 invalid.  \n  LEFT (0, 0) \u2014 apple at (0, 0) \u2192 yes.  \n  RIGHT (2, 0) \u2014 empty.  \n  \u2192 2 safe moves, one leads to apple (0, 0).  \n\n- **LEFT to (0, 1):**  \n  After moving, body: (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4) \u2014 tail (1, 4).  \n  Next turn from (0, 1):  \n  UP (0, 2) \u2014 apple at (0, 2) \u2192 yes.  \n  DOWN (0, 0) \u2014 apple at (0, 0) \u2192 yes.  \n  LEFT off board \u2192 invalid.  \n  RIGHT (1, 1) \u2014 body segment 2 \u2192 invalid.  \n  \u2192 2 safe moves, both lead to apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI need apples (10 vs 19).  \nLEFT to (0, 1) gives two apple options next turn (UP to (0, 2) or DOWN to (0, 0)).  \nUP to (1, 2) also gives apple at (0, 2) next turn via LEFT.  \nDOWN to (1, 0) gives apple at (0, 0) next turn via LEFT.  \n\nLEFT now is slightly better because from (0, 1) I can choose between two apples next turn, giving flexibility depending on enemy movement. Also, (0, 1) is board edge but not trapped yet.  \n\nCheck safety after eating apple:  \nIf I go LEFT to (0, 1), then next turn UP to (0, 2) apple:  \nBody becomes length 12: (0, 2), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4).  \nFrom (0, 2) after eating:  \nUP (0, 3) \u2014 empty.  \nDOWN (0, 1) \u2014 body segment 2 \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT off board \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT (1, 2) \u2014 empty.  \nSo 2 safe moves.  \n\nIf instead DOWN to (0, 0) apple next turn:  \nBody length 12: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4).  \nFrom (0, 0) after eating:  \nUP (0, 1) \u2014 body segment 2 \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN off board \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT off board \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT (1, 0) \u2014 empty.  \nOnly 1 safe move \u2014 risky. So better to go UP to (0, 2) apple next turn if I choose LEFT now.  \n\nUP now to (1, 2) also fine, but LEFT now gives same apple access with more apple choice flexibility.  \n\nEnemy is far, so no immediate danger.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nGo LEFT now to (0, 1). Next turn, likely go UP to (0, 2) apple unless enemy moves near (0, 2), then maybe DOWN to (0, 0) apple.  \n\nLEFT",

After eating (0, 4), my tail will move forward (currently tail at (1, 4) \u2192 will move to (2, 4) after 2 moves if no apple eaten earlier? Wait, I ate apple last turn, so tail stays until I move without eating apple. Actually, I ate apple last turn (from (0,1) to (0,2) with apple), so my length increased by 1, tail didn\u2019t move. So tail is still (1, 4). After moving to (0,3) without eating, tail will move to (0,1) next turn, freeing (1,4). That opens more space.  \n\nSo UP \u2192 (0, 3) now, then UP \u2192 (0, 4) apple next turn, then from (0,4) likely go UP toward (0,7) apple or RIGHT toward (1,4) (now free after tail moves).  \n\nUP",

Need to collect apples efficiently but safely.  \nUP to (0,4) apple is immediate gain, but after that I\u2019m at (0,4) with only UP and RIGHT safe next turn. UP (0,5) leads toward (0,7) apple eventually, but that path is long and may get tight.  \nRIGHT to (1,3) gives more options next turn, including RIGHT to (2,3) apple, and also UP to (1,4) free.  \n\nHowever, enemy is at (6,8) moving RIGHT to (7,8) this turn, far from me. No immediate threat.  \n\nEating apple now grows me, but also delays tail movement, keeping body blocks longer.  \nGiven I\u2019m much shorter than enemy, growing is important, but preserving mobility is also key.  \n\nLet\u2019s check if UP to (0,4) apple could trap me later:  \nAfter (0,4), next turn if I go UP to (0,5), then from (0,5) only UP (0,6) and RIGHT (1,5) safe \u2014 still okay. Could eventually reach (0,7) apple.  \n\nRIGHT to (1,3) avoids immediate growth, tail will move next turn from (2,4) to (0,1), freeing space. That might open more options later.  \n\nBut given the score gap, I should prioritize apple collection. UP gives apple now, and still has 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go UP to (0,4) apple, next turn from (0,4) I can go UP toward (0,7) apple or RIGHT to (1,4) (free after tail moves? Wait, tail stays because I ate apple now, so (1,4) still free? Actually tail at (2,4) now, after I eat apple, tail stays at (2,4) until I move without eating. So (1,4) is empty now and will stay empty next turn unless enemy moves there. Enemy far away, so (1,4) safe.)  \n\nSo UP now, then next turn likely RIGHT to (1,4) to avoid going up into a potential dead end at top left corner later.  \n\nUP",

Tail moves from (2,4) to (0,3)? Wait: body order after move:  \nIf I go RIGHT to (1,4), new head (1,4), then old body: (0,4) becomes segment 1, (0,3) segment 2, \u2026 tail (2,4) is last segment. After moving without eating, tail moves off (2,4) to (3,4)? Let\u2019s trace: current body: (0,4) head, then (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4) tail.  \nIf I move to (1,4), new body: (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3), (3,4), (2,4). Tail (2,4) is removed, so (2,4) becomes empty next turn. So from (1,4), RIGHT to (2,4) will be empty next turn.  \n\nThus from (1,4) next turn:  \nUP (1,5) \u2014 empty.  \nDOWN (1,3) \u2014 empty.  \nLEFT (0,4) \u2014 my body \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT (2,4) \u2014 empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves, none immediate apple but more space.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019m behind in apples (12 vs 22). Need to collect apples efficiently.  \nUP now leads to (0,6) apple next turn if I choose UP again then.  \nRIGHT now gives more mobility but delays apple.  \n\nGiven enemy is far away and I\u2019m in the left column, moving UP toward (0,6) and (0,7) apples seems good.  \nBut going UP to (0,5) then UP to (0,6) apple puts me at top left edge with only RIGHT as exit after eating (0,6) apple. Could be tight later.  \n\nRIGHT to (1,4) opens central board access toward apples like (2,3), (3,6), (1,7) eventually, with more movement options.  \n\nSince I\u2019m shorter, staying flexible might be better. Let\u2019s check immediate danger: enemy moving RIGHT to (8,8), far from me.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose RIGHT to (1,4) for better future mobility, then next turn decide between going for (2,3) apple or (1,5) toward (3,6) etc.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,4), consider moving RIGHT to (2,4) (now empty after tail moves) or UP to (1,5). If (2,3) apple is reachable via (2,4) \u2192 (2,3) DOWN, check safety then.  \n\nRIGHT",

Let\u2019s check carefully:  \n\nEnemy body list:  \n(8,7), (8,8), (7,8), (6,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), (5,9), (5,8), (5,7), (5,6), (5,5)  \n\nFrom head (8,6):  \nUP (8,7) \u2192 occupied by (8,7) (segment 1) \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN (8,5) \u2192 occupied by (8,5) (segment 8) \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT (7,6) \u2192 occupied by (7,6) (segment 6) \u2192 invalid.  \nRIGHT (9,6) \u2192 occupied by (9,6) (segment 10) \u2192 invalid.  \n\nYes \u2014 enemy is completely trapped and will die this turn unless I\u2019m missing something (maybe board has more space due to tail moving after enemy\u2019s last move?). But enemy\u2019s tail is at (5,5), so no new space opens for enemy this turn because all moves are blocked by its own body.  \n\nSo enemy #0 will die this turn. That means if I survive this turn, I win immediately (all opponents dead).  \n\n---\n\n**My priority:** Avoid any move that could kill me.  \n\nCheck each safe move:  \n\n- **UP to (2,6):**  \n  Next turn from (2,6): UP (2,7) empty, DOWN (2,5) my old head? Wait, after moving UP, my body becomes: (2,6), (2,4), (1,4), ... tail (4,3) drops off. So (2,5) is empty next turn. So safe.  \n\n- **LEFT to (1,5):**  \n  Next turn from (1,5): UP (1,6) empty, DOWN (1,4) my body (segment 2), LEFT (0,5) empty, RIGHT (2,5) empty. Safe.  \n\n- **RIGHT to (3,5):**  \n  Next turn from (3,5): UP (3,6) apple, DOWN (3,4) empty, LEFT (2,5) empty, RIGHT (4,5) empty. Safe.  \n\nAll three are safe now.  \n\n---\n\n**But** \u2014 need to ensure no head-on collision with enemy this turn? Enemy head is at (8,6), I\u2019m at (2,5), Manhattan distance 6+1=7, impossible to collide in one move.  \n\nSo all three moves keep me alive and enemy dies.  \n\n---\n\n**Which move is best for future mobility after winning?**  \nActually, if enemy dies this turn, game ends immediately after this turn with me alive \u2192 I win. So future mobility doesn\u2019t matter.  \n\nBut just in case the game doesn\u2019t end until after all snakes move and then check deaths, I must survive this turn. All three moves safe.  \n\nPick one that doesn\u2019t risk accidental death \u2014 all fine.  \n\nI\u2019ll go UP toward (3,6) apple area for next turn if needed, but likely won\u2019t need next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nEnemy will die this turn, so just survive. Choose UP.  \n\nUP",
