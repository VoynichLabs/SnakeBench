This gets me closer to the apple at (0,8) while maintaining multiple safe follow-up options. From (1,8), I can still move LEFT to reach the apple at (0,8) next turn, or I could change direction if needed. This is safer than committing to LEFT immediately, which would be more restrictive.\n\n**Long-term Plan Note:**\nFocus on collecting the apple at (0,8) first since it's closest to me and farthest from the enemy. After that, assess the board position and move toward other apples while maintaining awareness of enemy snake movements. Avoid getting trapped in corners and maintain flexibility in movement options.\n\nDOWN",

Keeps me away from the left wall edge.\n\n**DOWN (1,6)**: Would move me directly onto the apple at (1,6)! This is the closest apple to me and I can collect it immediately this turn.\n\n**RIGHT (2,7)**: Moves me right, positioning me to approach the apple at (4,7), but requires multiple turns to reach it.\n\n**Strategic Considerations**\nThe apple at (1,6) is directly below me and I can collect it immediately by moving DOWN. This is the highest priority target since it's the closest apple and I can gain a point right away. The enemy snake is far enough away at (5,2) that they pose no immediate threat to this apple.\n\n**Long-term Plan Note**\nIf I collect the apple at (1,6), I'll need to plan my next move carefully. From (1,6), I could move UP back to (1,7) or RIGHT toward (2,6) to avoid my growing body. The apple at (4,7) will be my next priority target after this one.\n\nDOWN",

Analyze the current board state and safe moves**\n\n**Current position**: My snake's head is at (3,5) with body [(3,6), (4,6), (4,7), (3,7)].\n\n**Safe move options from (3,5)**:\n- **UP**: (3,6) - This is my own body segment, would kill me\n- **DOWN**: (3,4) - Empty space, safe\n- **LEFT**: (2,5) - Empty space, safe\n- **RIGHT**: (4,5) - Empty space, safe\n\nSo I can move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**2. Check for head-on collision risk**\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (6,3) with body [(5,3), (4,3), (3,3), (2,3)]. From (6,3), it can move:\n- UP: (6,4) - Empty space, safe\n- DOWN: (6,2) - Empty space, safe\n- LEFT: (5,3) - This is its own body, would kill it\n- RIGHT: (7,3) - Empty space, safe\n\nSo enemy snake #0 can move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n**3. Evaluate each safe move option**\n\n**DOWN to (3,4)**:\n- Safe from immediate collision\n- Moves me closer to the apple at (3,1) - I'm now at (3,5), so DOWN to (3,4) is the right direction\n- Keeps me on the left side of the board, away from snake #0's likely movement path\n- From (3,4), I can continue DOWN to (3,3), (3,2), etc. toward the apple\n- However, (3,3) is currently occupied by snake #0's body, so I need to watch that\n\n**LEFT to (2,5)**:\n- Safe from immediate collision\n- Moves me toward the left edge but not directly toward any apple\n- Could potentially corner me against the left wall\n- Less direct path to the nearest apple at (3,1)\n\n**RIGHT to (4,5)**:\n- Safe from immediate collision\n- Moves me away from the apple at (3,1)\n- Brings me closer to the center of the board and potentially closer to snake #0's territory\n- From (4,5), I could move DOWN to (4,4), but that's still not on the direct path to any apple\n\n**4. Consider apple proximity and future strategy**\n\nAvailable apples:\n- (8,0) - Bottom right - Far away\n- (0,9) - Top left - Far away\n- (6,1) - Bottom right - Far away\n- (8,3) - Top right - Far away\n- (3,1) - Bottom left - This is my target\n\nI'm currently at (3,5) and the nearest apple is at (3,1). Moving DOWN gets me closer to it directly.\n\n**5. Decision**\n\nBetween DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT, **DOWN to (3,4)** is clearly the better choice because:\n\n- It moves me directly toward the apple at (3,1) which is only 3 moves away now\n- It keeps me on the left side of the board, away from snake #0's likely movement path\n- It maintains the most direct route to my target apple\n- It avoids the risk of getting cornered against the left wall or moving into enemy territory\n\n**Long-term plan**: Continue moving DOWN toward the apple at (3,1). I should reach it in 3 more moves if I can maintain a straight path. Need to be careful as I approach the bottom of the board and watch for snake #0's movements. Once I get that apple, I'll have 5 total and win the game immediately.\n\nDOWN",

Wait - (3,3) is currently occupied by enemy snake #0's body!\n\nThis means my **DOWN** move to (3,3) would actually kill me because that's where enemy snake #0's body currently is.\n\n**Updated Safe Moves:**\n- **DOWN**: (3,3) - Currently enemy body, but enemy will move this turn\n- **LEFT**: (2,4) - Empty space, safe \u2705\n- **RIGHT**: (4,4) - Empty space, safe \u2705\n\n**Enemy Snake #0 Movement Options from (7,3):**\n- UP: (7,4) - Empty space, safe\n- DOWN: (7,2) - Empty space, safe  \n- LEFT: (6,3) - This is its own body, would kill it \u274c\n- RIGHT: (8,3) - There's an apple there! This is very likely\n\nIf enemy snake #0 moves RIGHT to (8,3) to eat the apple, then (3,3) would become empty and my DOWN move would be safe. But if it moves UP or DOWN instead, (3,3) remains occupied.\n\n**Evaluating Remaining Safe Moves:**\n\n**LEFT to (2,4):**\n- Definitely safe regardless of enemy movement\n- Moves me toward the left edge\n- Not directly toward any apple\n\n**RIGHT to (4,4):**\n- Definitely safe regardless of enemy movement  \n- Moves me away from the apple at (3,1)\n- Brings me closer to enemy territory\n\n**DOWN to (3,3):**\n- Risky - depends on enemy snake #0's movement\n- If enemy moves RIGHT to the apple, this becomes safe and moves me directly toward the apple at (3,1)\n- If enemy moves UP or DOWN, I die\n\nGiven that enemy snake #0 has a clear opportunity to eat an apple at (8,3) by moving RIGHT, this is the most likely move. The probability favors the DOWN move being safe.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN - The enemy is likely to move RIGHT to the apple, making (3,3) safe and allowing me to continue toward the apple at (3,1).\n\nDOWN",
