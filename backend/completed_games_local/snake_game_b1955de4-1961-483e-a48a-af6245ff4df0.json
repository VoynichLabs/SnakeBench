It keeps more escape options (can go to 7,8 / 8,9 / 8,7 next turn) compared to moving DOWN into (9,7) which tightens options against the wall.\n- This move is safe (no immediate collisions) and advances scoring.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns:\n- After LEFT to (8,8), prioritize moving toward the cluster around (5,8)/(5,9)/(6,9) while avoiding trapping myself along the right edge. Keep space and avoid moving directly back into my tail.\n\nLEFT",

That leaves me with no safe follow-up and likely death next turn.\n\nWhy LEFT is safer:\n- Moving LEFT into the current tail (7,9) is legal because the tail will vacate.\n- From (7,9) I will have at least one safe continuation (LEFT to (6,9)), and DOWN may be available if the tail frees (7,8). This keeps more escape options and lets me start heading toward the apple cluster on the left side of the board.\n\nShort plan:\n- Move left along the top row to gain space, then descend toward the apple cluster around x=1..3 while avoiding tight turns near my own body and the top wall.

That corridor is effectively blocked for many turns, so going right risks getting trapped or wasting moves.\n- UP -> (1,8): legal and safe. Keeps options open but doesn't make progress toward the dense apple cluster in the lower-left (many apples at x=0..3, y=0..3).\n- LEFT -> (0,7): legal and safe.

From (0,7) I can go down and sweep that cluster reliably, while the opponent is on the far right and unlikely to contest those apples soon.\n\nChosen short plan (for next few turns):\n- Move LEFT now to (0,7).\n- Then go DOWN to reach the low-left cluster and sweep apples there (favor grabbing (1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,2),(2,3),(3,0)).\n- Avoid hugging the very corner too long; if the cluster is cleared or enemy approaches, shift back toward center to maintain escape options.\n\nLEFT",

Comparison:\n- UP -> (0,8) then (0,9) gets the apple at (0,9) in two moves, but pulls me away from the large dense cluster of apples in the lower-left (x=0..3, y=0..3).\n- DOWN -> (0,6) moves directly toward the high-value cluster (apples at (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0),(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,2),(2,3),(3,0)). The enemy is on the right side and unlikely to contest those soon. The column x=0 downwards is clear, so I can safely enter and sweep that cluster while keeping escape options along the way.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Move DOWN now to (0,6).\n- Continue down the x=0 column to reach and collect bottom-left apples, then sweep right/up through the cluster.\n- If the cluster is cleared or the opponent approaches, shift back toward the center/top to avoid a corner trap.\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT is also toward the cluster but takes at least one extra step to get into the same column.\n- Follow-up options: From (1,4) I will have three non-backwards moves (DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT) available, giving more flexibility and reducing trap risk. From (2,5) UP is into my body and LEFT would be backwards, so I'd have fewer safe follow-ups.\n- Enemy threat: Opponent head is at (4,6). They could move down, but they are not positioned to contest (1,4)/(1,3) immediately. A head-on collision risk on the chosen path is low.\n- Overall safety: DOWN keeps multiple exits, gets me closer to an apple immediately, and avoids hugging the left wall longer.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Move DOWN to (1,4) then DOWN to (1,3) to eat the apple, then sweep the nearby cluster (1,2),(2,2),(2,1),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0) while keeping at least two exit directions available each step.\n- If the enemy pushes toward the cluster aggressively, abandon the sweep early and move toward the center/top to maintain freedom of movement.\n\nDOWN",

The enemy head is at (2,9) and too far to threaten a head-on collision this turn. After moving to (9,5) I'll have room to continue upward toward (9,7) and (9,1)/(9,5) apples in this column before attempting to re-enter the central area. Avoid turning left into the dense cluster around x=5..8 until there's a clear, safe window.\n\nShort plan:\nTake the apple at (9,5) now, then proceed up to collect nearby column-9 apples while monitoring the enemy head. Once column-9 apples are exhausted or blocked, look for a safe gap to move left into more open space, avoiding getting trapped against the dense enemy body around x=5..8.\n\nUP",

That leaves UP and LEFT.\n\nComparison and risk:\n- UP (9,7) gets one apple and keeps me on column 9. There are no enemy heads near enough to contest (9,7) this turn.\n- LEFT (8,6) gets an apple in column 8 and opens a very good sequence: (8,7), (8,8), (8,9) are also apples (cluster at x=8). Enemy snake #0\u2019s head is at (4,9) and its body around x=5..8 is mostly below or to the left (e.g. (8,5)), but no other head is close enough to cause a head-on collision at (8,6) this turn. Moving into (8,6) does not hit my own body.\n\nPreference: LEFT. It immediately grabs an apple and puts me into a dense apple cluster at x=8 where I can likely chain several apples in a few turns. It also keeps multiple follow-up moves (up to collect the column of apples, or back toward open space) and avoids the tighter congested corridor around x=5..7 where I could get trapped later.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Collect (8,6) now, then go UP to (8,7), then (8,8) and (8,9) if safe, collecting multiple apples.\n- After exhausting/getting blocked in that column, head left into open space (x\u22647) and avoid the enemy body cluster around x=5..6. Watch snake #0 head movement; avoid crossing their body where they might cut me off.\n\nLEFT",

No enemy head can contest (8,8) this turn. This maximizes apples and keeps escape routes open.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Take (8,8) now, then (8,9) if still available to chain apples.\n- After collecting the small top cluster, move left into more open rows (x \u2264 7) and avoid the dense enemy body region around x=4..6.\n- Continuously watch snake #0 head; avoid head-on confrontations and tight corridors.\n\nUP",
