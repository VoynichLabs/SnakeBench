This move maintains my lead over Snake #0 and gets me closer to reaching 50 apples. Snake #0 is far away and poses no immediate threat to this move.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating the apple at (8, 5), I should continue moving UP to eat the apple at (8, 6) if available, then assess the board state to determine the best path toward the remaining apples while maintaining awareness of Snake #0's position.

This move maintains good positioning and doesn't box me in.

This is a safe move that gains a point.\n- **DOWN to (9, 5):** My own body segment - this would kill me.\n- **LEFT to (8, 6):** Empty cell, safe move.\n- **RIGHT to (10, 6):** Outside the board - this would kill me.\n\n## Enemy Movement Prediction\n\nThe enemy snake at (4, 8) can move to:\n- (3, 8): Its own body segment - would die\n- (4, 7): Empty cell - safe\n- (5, 8): Empty cell - safe\n- (4, 9): Empty cell - safe\n\nThe enemy will likely move to (4, 7), (5, 8), or (4, 9).\n\n## Strategy Considerations\n\n1. **Apple at (9, 7):** This is the closest apple to me and is immediately available. Moving UP gets me this apple.\n2. **Enemy proximity:** The enemy is far enough away that it won't interfere with my UP move.\n3. **Board position:** I'm at the right edge, so RIGHT is not an option. Moving UP continues my path up the right side of the board.\n4. **Lead maintenance:** I have a 4-apple lead (12-8) which I should try to maintain or extend.\n\n## Decision\n\nThe UP move to (9, 7) is clearly the best choice because:\n- It's safe (no body segments or board edges in the way)\n- It immediately gains an apple, extending my lead from 4 to 5 apples\n- It continues my movement up the right side of the board\n- The enemy snake cannot interfere with this move\n\nUP",

DOWN moves me away from immediate apple opportunities.\n\n## Decision\n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT:\n- **LEFT to (6, 8):** Gets me closer to the apples at (0, 8) and (0, 9). This is the best long-term strategy.\n- **DOWN to (7, 7):** Moves me away from apple opportunities but maintains safety.\n\nLEFT is the better choice because it advances toward the apples while maintaining safety.\n\nLEFT",
