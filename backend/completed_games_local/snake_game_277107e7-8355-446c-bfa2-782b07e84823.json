I need to prioritize safety and apple collection.\n\nMy current position is (7, 3).\nThe enemy head is at (2, 4).\n\nAvailable apples closest to me:\n(8, 6) is 5 steps away (1 right, 3 up) - A bit far, but appealing.\n(4, 4) is 4 steps away (3 left, 1 up) - Good option.\n(6, 2) is 2 steps away (1 left, 1 down) - Very close.\n(9, 1) is 4 steps away (2 right, 2 down).\n(4, 2) is 3 steps away (3 left, 1 down).\n\nLet's evaluate safe moves from (7, 3):\n\n1. **UP (to 7, 4):** Safe. No body, on board.\n2. **DOWN (to 7, 2):** Safe. No body, on board. (6, 2) is reachable in 2 moves if I go down then left.\n3. **LEFT (to 6, 3):** Safe. No body, on board. (6, 2) is reachable in 2 moves if I go left then down.\n4. **RIGHT (to 8, 3):** Safe. No body, on board.\n\nI need to consider where Snake #0 (2, 4) might go.\nH0 is at (2, 4). It has apples nearby:\n(2, 5) is 1 UP.\n(2, 1) is 3 DOWN.\n(1, 0) is 4 steps (1 left, 4 down).\n(4, 4) is 2 steps (2 right).\n\nIt is likely Snake #0 will go UP or RIGHT to grab an apple.\nIf H0 goes UP to (2, 5), it gets an apple.\nIf H0 goes RIGHT to (3, 4), it moves towards (4, 4).\n\nMy primary goal is to eat an apple quickly. (6, 2) is the closest apple.\n\nIf I move:\nA) **UP to (7, 4):** I get closer to (8, 6) or (4, 4).\nB) **DOWN to (7, 2):** I am 1 move away from (6, 2) (down and left).\nC) **LEFT to (6, 3):** I am 1 move away from (6, 2) (left and down).\nD) **RIGHT to (8, 3):** Doesn't seem to lead anywhere good immediately.\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT give me a 2-move path to (6, 2).\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 3), I am on the same row as the enemy snake's current X coordinate (2, 4) but far away in X.\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 2), I am further away from the enemy's likely expansion zone (the middle of the board around Y=4, 5).\n\nLet's look at the area around (6, 2).\n(6, 2) is a good spot.\nIf I go LEFT (6, 3) then DOWN (6, 2), I eat the apple.\nIf I go DOWN (7, 2) then LEFT (6, 2), I eat the apple.\n\nIf I go LEFT: (7, 3) -> (6, 3).\nNext turn possibilities:\n- UP to (6, 4): Closer to (4, 4).\n- DOWN to (6, 2): EAT APPLE!\n- LEFT to (5, 3).\n- RIGHT to (7, 3) (backwards move, but I'm only length 1 so it's safe now, but strategically bad).\n\nIf I go DOWN: (7, 3) -> (7, 2).\nNext turn possibilities:\n- UP to (7, 3).\n- DOWN to (7, 1): Closer to (9, 1).\n- LEFT to (6, 2): EAT APPLE!\n- RIGHT to (8, 2).\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN seem equally viable for reaching (6, 2) quickly.\n\nHowever, moving LEFT brings me closer to the center of the board where the enemy (2, 4) is located, potentially leading to congestion sooner if we both aim for central apples like (4, 4).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7, 2), I maintain a higher Y coordinate distance from the enemy, who is likely moving UP towards (2, 5) or RIGHT towards (4, 4).\n\nIf Snake #0 goes UP to (2, 5), it secures an apple.\nIf Snake #0 goes RIGHT to (3, 4), it sets up for (4, 4).\nIf Snake #0 goes DOWN to (2, 3), it sets up for (2, 1).\n\nI will maximize my chances for the nearest apple while maintaining safety. (6, 2) is the target.\n\nLet's choose DOWN. (7, 3) -> (7, 2).\nThis keeps me away from the enemy's influence zone for now and positions me well for (6, 2) next turn. It also slightly opens up the possibility of going for (4, 2) afterwards if (6, 2) is secured, or (9, 1).\n\nLet's check for head-on collision risks.\nH1 is at (7, 3). H0 is at (2, 4). They are far apart. No immediate collision risk.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 2), my options next turn are:\n1. (6, 2) - Apple\n2. (7, 1) - Closer to (9, 1)\n3. (8, 2)\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 3), my options next turn are:\n1. (6, 2) - Apple\n2. (6, 4) - Closer to (4, 4), (6, 8)\n3. (5, 3)\n\nMoving LEFT seems slightly more ambitious regarding other apples (4, 4) and (6, 8) if I want to deviate later, but also puts me more in line with Snake #0 if they move right aggressively towards the center.\n\n(6, 2) is the easiest apple to secure. I'll stick to securing it first.\n\nIf I go DOWN, I am hugging the right side of the board for now, which is generally safer from a centrally located opponent.\n\nI choose DOWN.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (7, 2). Next turn move LEFT to (6, 2) to grab the apple.\n\nDOWN",

DOWN to (2, 4): Dies (moves into its own body/tail, even though it's the tail, it becomes the head of a new segment at (2, 4) while the old tail stays or moves; since it just grew, moving into (2, 4) is moving backward into the body.

Last turn, ID 0 was at (2, 5) H and (2, 4) B. If the body list provided in this turn's input `Body: [(2, 5)]` is correct, and the previous location of its body was (2, 4), then Snake #0 must have moved from (2, 5) to (3, 5) (RIGHT), and its old head (2, 5) became the new body segment, and the old body (2, 4) must have been removed if it didn't eat. BUT the score shows Snake #0 also has 1 apple.\n    *   *Reconciliation of Snake #0's status:*\n        *   T=1 Start: H(2, 4). B([]). Apples 0.\n        *   T=1 Move: Snake #0 moved UP to (2, 5) and collected an apple (A at (2, 5) was not listed, so maybe it was at (2, 5) an apple was there). Let's assume the previous turn logic was incorrect regarding the specific apple location but correct on the result: Snake #0 grew to L=2.\n        *   If T=1 end: H(2, 5), B[(2, 4)]. Apples 1.\n        *   T=2 Start: H(3, 5), B[(2, 5)]. Apples 1. This means Snake #0 moved RIGHT from (2, 5) to (3, 5). The previous head (2, 5) became the new body segment. Since the snake grew last turn, its tail (2, 4 if it was the tail) would have remained, resulting in L=3 *if* it ate and then moved.\n        *   Let's check the provided data carefully: Enemy snake #0 - Head: (3, 5), Body: [(2, 5)], Apples: 1. This means Snake #0 is currently length 2. If it is length 2 and has 1 apple, it must have eaten on Turn 1 OR Turn 2 (if the game state shows the result *after* the T=2 move, which is incorrect for simultaneous moves). Assuming the state provided is *before* the S1 move/action, and *after* the S0 move/action from T1.\n        *   The standard interpretation is: The state is reported *after* Turn 1 moves have been executed and growth/death resolved.\n        *   T=1 End State: Your Snake H(6, 2), B[(7, 2)], L=2. Enemy Snake H(3, 5), B[(2, 5)], L=2. Both have 1 apple.\n        *   Your Snake moved H(7, 2) -> (6, 2) (LEFT) and ate an apple (6, 2 was not on the apple list for T=2, confirming it was eaten).\n        *   Enemy Snake moved H(2, 5) -> (3, 5) (RIGHT). It must have eaten an apple at (3, 5) if it grew, but if it didn't eat, it should have been L=1 unless it grew on T0 and just moved. Given the body length is 1 segment and it has 1 apple, complexity arises.\n        *   A snake of length L has L-1 body segments. Snake 0 is H(3, 5), B[(2, 5)], Length 2. This is consistent with having moved from (2, 5) to (3, 5) and *not* eating, *if* it grew on Turn 1.\n        *   Let's assume the body structure is correct: Head (3, 5) connected to Body (2, 5). Length 2.\n\n*   **Apples Remaining:** (4, 0), (4, 7), (4, 2), (6, 0), (0, 8), (4, 8), (6, 8), (8, 6), (2, 1), (4, 4), (9, 9), (1, 0), (9, 1), (6, 1), (8, 3).\n*   **Board State:**\n    H1 = (6, 2), B1 = (7, 2)\n    H0 = (3, 5), B0 = (2, 5)\n\n 9 . . . . . . . . .

Highly desirable.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 2):** Safe. No apple.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 2):** **Backward move.** Forbidden (moves into own body segment (7, 2)). Immediate death.\n\nImmediate priority: Secure the apple at (6, 1).\n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 0) Analysis from (3, 5):**\n\nPossible moves for H0 (3, 5):\n1.  **UP to (3, 6):** Safe. No apple.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 4):** Safe. No apple.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 5):** Dies (moves into own body segment (2, 5)). Forbidden.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 5):** Safe. No apple.\n\nEnemy Snake 0 is far away from (6, 1). It is 3 units away horizontally and 4 units away vertically. E.g., distance to (6, 1) is $\\sqrt{(6-3)^2 + (1-5)^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 16} = 5$ moves (Manhattan distance: $3+4=7$).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 1), I eat the apple. My new state: H(6, 1), B[(6, 2), (7, 2)]. Length 3. Score 2.\n\n**Collision Check (Your Move DOWN):**\n\n*   My new head (6, 1) is not (3, 5) (Enemy Head).\n*   My new head (6, 1) is not in B0 [(2, 5)].\n*   Enemy Head potential moves (3, 6), (3, 4), (4, 5). None of these land on my body [(6, 2), (7, 2)] or my new head (6, 1).\n\nThe move DOWN is safe and leads to growth.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turns (T=3 onwards):**\nIf I move DOWN, I will be at (6, 1), L=3. Nearby apples are:\n*   (4, 2) (2 steps away: L, U)\n*   (4, 0) (3 steps away: L, L, D or D, L, L)\n*   (2, 1) (4 steps away: L, L, L)\n*   (8, 3) (4 steps away: R, R, U, U)\n*   (6, 0) (1 step away: D) -> This is the closest if I move DOWN to (6, 1).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 1), the next logical apple is (6, 0).\n\nLet's check if (6, 0) is a good choice.\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 1): H(6, 1), B[(6, 2), (7, 2)].\nNext turn, I can move DOWN to (6, 0). This is safe and another apple.\n\nEnemy H0 is at (3, 5). If H0 moves RIGHT to (4, 5), it is now looking towards the center column x=4, which has many apples ((4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 4), (4, 2), (4, 0)).\nIf H0 moves to (4, 5): Next, it can move to (4, 4) (apple).\nIf H0 moves to (3, 6) or (3, 4), it's still relatively centered.\n\nIf I secure (6, 1) and (6, 0) in the next two turns (T=2, T=3), I will be L=4. H(6, 0), B[(6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2)]. My position is secure on the bottom right quadrant. From there, I can aim for (4, 0) or (8, 3) or circle UP.\n\nThis plan seems safe and efficient for immediate growth.\n\n**Final Move Check (Turn 2):**\nMove: DOWN to (6, 1). Safe. Apple.\n\nDOWN",

Tails are T0=(3, 5), T1=(7, 2).)\n\n**Objective:** Get to the next apple, preferably (4, 0), before Snake 0.\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1) Possible Moves from (6, 0):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 1):** Hits own body (B1). **DEATH.** *This is the segment we just came from, and since we grew, it's still part of the body.*\n2.  **DOWN to (6, -1):** Off board. **DEATH.**\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 0):** Safe. No apple. Move towards (4, 0).\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 0):** Safe. No apple. Moves away from immediate valuable apples.\n\n**Safe Moves for H1:** LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy Snake (ID 0) Analysis from (4, 4):**\n\nH0 is at (4, 4). B0 is [(3, 4), (3, 5)]. Tail T0 will disappear if H0 doesn't eat.\nNearby apples: (4, 2), (4, 7), (4, 8). (4, 2) is closest (2 steps down).\n\nPossible moves for H0 (4, 4):\n1.  **UP to (4, 5):** Safe. 2 steps to (4, 7).\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 3):** Safe. 1 step towards (4, 2). (4, 2) is a strong candidate.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 4):** Hits own body (B0). **DEATH.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 4):** Safe. No immediate apple.\n\nLikely moves for H0 are UP (to (4, 5)) or DOWN (to (4, 3)). Given the proximity of (4, 2) and the center concentration, DOWN seems slightly more favored.\n\n**Head-to-Head Collision Check (H1 at (6, 0)):**\n*   H1 is far from H0 (4, 4). No immediate danger of collision.\n\n**Optimal Move for H1:**\n\nWe want to reach the apple at (4, 0).\n*   Moving LEFT to (5, 0) brings us 1 step closer to (4, 0).\n*   If we move LEFT, we will be at (5, 0). Next turn we can move LEFT again to (4, 0) and eat the apple.\n\nIf H0 moves DOWN to (4, 3):\nTurn 4: H1: (5, 0), H0: (4, 3).\nTurn 5: H1 moves to (4, 0) (EATS). H0 moves to (4, 2) (EATS).\nThis is acceptable, as we secure an apple (4, 0) without interference.\n\nIf H0 moves UP to (4, 5):\nTurn 4: H1: (5, 0), H0: (4, 5).\nTurn 5: H1 moves to (4, 0) (EATS). H0 targets (4, 7) or (4, 8).\n\nMoving LEFT to (5, 0) seems safest and most direct path to the next apple (4, 0). It maintains our initiative in the bottom right quadrant.\n\n**Detailed Check of Safety (Moving LEFT to (5, 0)):**\n\n*   New H1: (5, 0).\n*   New B1: [(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)]. Tail (7, 2) disappears if we don't eat. Since we didn't eat, the tail retracts. New body is [(6, 1), (6, 2)]. (Wait, this is wrong. The growth from eating on T3 means our NEW length is 4. Since we don't eat on T4, the tail (7, 2) retracts.\n    *   H1 T3: (6, 0). B1 T3: [(6, 1), (6, 2), (7, 2)]. Length 4.\n    *   Move LEFT: H1 T4 moves to (5, 0).\n    *   New B1 T4 (retaining length 3): [(6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)]. (7, 2) is empty.\n    *   Enemy B0: T4 will be [(3, 4), (3, 5')] or [(4, 4), (3, 4)] if H0 moves down to (4, 3) and doesn't eat. Wait, H0 *did* eat on T3, so its length is 3.\n        *   H0 T3: (4, 4). B0 T3: [(3, 4), (3, 5)]. Length 3.\n        *   If H0 moves DOWN to (4, 3) (no eat), B0 T4: [(4, 4), (3, 4)]. (3, 5) is empty.\n\n*   No enemy head movement leads to (5, 0).\n*   No current snake body segment is at (5, 0).\n\nLEFT is a safe and optimal move.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1. Move LEFT to (5, 0).\n2. Move LEFT to (4, 0) (Eat apple).\n3. From (4, 0), prioritize (1, 0) or (4, 2). Since (4, 2) puts us closer to the enemy, (1, 0) might be safer, but (4, 2) is a cluster point. We will decide after eating (4, 0).\n\nLEFT",

No apple. Moves towards (2, 6) (3 steps).\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 5):** Safe. No apple.\n\nH0 will almost certainly move UP to (4, 6) to grab (4, 7) or (4, 8).\n\n**Collision Check:**\n\n*   H1 moves to (4, 0).\n*   H0 likely moves to (4, 6).\n*   No collision possible. Both snakes secure their respective immediate targets ((4, 0) for me, (4, 7) for H0 next turn).\n\n**Chosen Move Rationale:**\nThe move LEFT to (4, 0) is immediately safe, results in eating an apple, extending our lead (4 vs 2), and increasing our length. This is unequivocally the best move.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Post-Eat at (4, 0)):**\nAfter eating (4, 0), H1 is at (4, 0). We will be length 5.\nImmediate apples nearby: (1, 0), (4, 2), (2, 1).\nPriority 1: (4, 2) [2 steps UP] or (1, 0) [3 steps LEFT].\nSince H0 is moving UP the center column (4, *y*), (4, 2) is highly contested or potentially blocked. If H0 moves UP to (4, 6), it will then move to (4, 7) (eat) and (4, 8) (eat). If H0 succeeds in eating both, the center column will be largely cleared for a while, making (4, 2) safer later, but it is currently highly attractive.\n\nAlternative: Move LEFT towards (1, 0) [(4, 0) -> (3, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (1, 0)]. This is a safer route laterally.\nAfter eating (4, 0), H1 will be at (4, 0). The body will temporarily be [(5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)].\n\nNext turn (Turn 6), if we go UP to (4, 1), we are 1 step from (4, 2). If we go LEFT to (3, 0), we move toward (1, 0) and (2, 1).\n\nI will prioritize the cluster of apples around (1, 0), (2, 1), (1, 8), (0, 8), which means moving towards the left edge.\nTurn 6 plan: Move UP towards (4, 2) if it seems safe, or LEFT/UP towards (3, 1) to cut across to (1, 0) and (2, 1). Given H0 is busy far away, (4, 2) is viable.\n\nLEFT",

Moves toward apple at (4, 2) (1 step away).\n2.  **DOWN to (4, -1):** Off board. **DEATH.**\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 0):** Safe. Moves toward apple at (1, 0) (3 steps away) and (2, 1) (4 steps away).\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 0):** Hits own body (B1 segment). **DEATH.** (This is moving directly backwards after an eating turn).\n\n**Safe Moves for H1:** UP (4, 1) or LEFT (3, 0).\n\n**Enemy Snake (H0) at (4, 6) Analysis:**\n\nH0 is positioned to grab apples up the center column.\nNearby apples: (4, 7) [1 step UP], (4, 8) [2 steps UP].\n\nPossible moves for H0 (4, 6):\n1.  **UP to (4, 7):** **EATS APPLE!** Safe. This is the optimal move for H0.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 5):** Hits own body (B0 segment). **DEATH.**\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 6):** Safe. Towards (2, 6) (1 step away).\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 6):** Safe. No apple.\n\nPrediction: H0 will move UP to (4, 7).\n\n**Strategic Decision for H1:**\n\nWe just scored. We are length 5, H0 is length 3 (or 4 after eating (4, 7)).\nH1 is at (4, 0).\nApples: (4, 2) [2 steps UP], (1, 0) [3 steps LEFT], (2, 1) [4 steps LEFT/UP].\n\n*   If H1 moves **UP to (4, 1):** H0 is moving UP at the same time. H0 will eat (4, 7). If we go (4, 1) -> (4, 2) next turn, we get the apple. This path keeps us close to the center for subsequent battles, but H0 will be right above us, potentially blocking access to the rest of the board later.\n*   If H1 moves **LEFT to (3, 0):** We move towards the less contested left side and the nearby apple (1, 0). (3, 0) -> (2, 0) -> (1, 0) (Eat). This secures a slightly safer path and avoids getting tangled with H0 immediately.\n\nLet's evaluate the trade-off:\n\n1.  **Pursuing (4, 2) (Move UP):**\n    *   Turn 6: H1 moves to (4, 1). H0 moves to (4, 7) (Eats).\n    *   Turn 7: H1 moves to (4, 2) (Eats). H0 will likely move to (4, 8) (Eats).\n    *   This secures two apples for us in succession and two for H0. We maintain our lead and increase length rapidly.\n\n2.  **Pursuing (1, 0) (Move LEFT):**\n    *   Turn 6: H1 moves to (3, 0). H0 moves to (4, 7) (Eats).\n    *   H0 is far up the board. We are gaining length slowly relative to H0's expected double eat.\n    *   This move is safer regarding immediate snake interactions, but might be suboptimal for maximizing score in the short term.\n\nGiven that H0 is committed to the (4, *y*) column above y=6, **(4, 2)** is uncontested *by H0* for our move on Turn 7. Moving UP to (4, 1) sets us up perfectly to consume (4, 2) next turn, securing our 5th apple while H0 secures its 3rd and 4th. This is an aggressive but safe path.\n\n**Checking Future Constraints (Turn 7 - H1 at (4, 2), H0 at (4, 8)):**\nIf H1 is at (4, 2), and H0 is at (4, 8).\nH1 body will be [(4, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)]. (Length 6).\nH0 body will be [(4, 7), (4, 6), (4, 5), (4, 4)]. (Length 5).\n\nFrom (4, 2), H1 can move LEFT (3, 2) or UP (4, 3).\nFrom (4, 8), H0 is trapped slightly. It can move LEFT (3, 8) or RIGHT (5, 8).\n\nThe immediate path on the center column gives us the most rapid score increase right now, and since H0 is going in the opposite direction on the Y-axis, there is no collision risk.\n\nMove: UP.\n\n**Long-term Plan (Post-Move UP):**\nTurn 7: Move UP to (4, 2) (Eat). H0 eats (4, 7) and then (4, 8).\nH1 will be long (6 units) and in the middle low section.\nPotential targets after (4, 2): (2, 1) or (1, 0) (requires moving LEFT). H0 will be high (y=8). We can safely cross and clear the left apples (e.g., (0, 3) or (2, 6) or (1, 8)). Priority will shift to the left side cluster.\n\nUP",

H0 will be at (4, 8), length 6.\nWe tied for length, but H1 maintains the score lead (5 vs 4).\nH1 targets next: (3, 2) or (5, 2) or (4, 3). The priority will shift to clearing the remaining apples in the lower-left quartile: (2, 1), (1, 0), (0, 3). Moving LEFT towards (3, 2) seems like a good egress strategy to avoid being constrained by H0's presence above.\n\nUP",

Moves into quadrant 4, near (9, 9).\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 7):** Hits own body (B0 segment). **DEATH.**\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 8):** Safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 8):** Safe. Leads toward (6, 8) apple.\n\nPrediction: H0 will likely move RIGHT to (5, 8) or UP to (4, 9). Moving RIGHT brings H0 closer to the rich cluster of apples on the right side of row 8.\n\n**Strategic Decision for H1 (at (4, 2)):**\n\nThe most immediate and advantageous move is LEFT to (3, 2), which secures an apple and increases our lead (current 5 vs 4).\n\nIf H1 moves LEFT to (3, 2) (Eat, Length 7):\n*   H1 is now positioned in the lower-left quartile, allowing access to apples (2, 1), (1, 0), (0, 3).\n*   This also clears the vertical line shared with H0, minimizing immediate collision risks.\n\nIf H1 moves UP to (4, 3) (Safe, Length 6):\n*   H1 is safe, but moving closer to H0's domain (4, 4) is the enemy tail endpoint).\n*   If H0 stays in the (4, *) column area (e.g., moves UP to (4, 9)), we might be able to intercept the vertical path, but H0 is long and currently blocking (4, 4) through (4, 7). Moving UP aggressively is risky unless we can escape horizontally quickly.\n\nIf H1 moves RIGHT to (5, 2) (Safe, Length 6):\n*   H1 could target the apple at (7, 2) or swing wide into the center-right.\n\n**Conclusion:** The apple at (3, 2) is a gift and improves our position relative to the surrounding apples. It takes us out of the direct line of fire from H0's tail segments along the 4-column.\n\n**Analyzing potential collisions with H0:**\n\nH1 is at (4, 2).\nH0 is at (4, 8).\nThe distance is 6 units. H1 moving LEFT to (3, 2) makes collision impossible this turn.\n\nWe *must* take the apple at (3, 2).\n\n**Long-term Plan (Post-Move LEFT):**\nH1 will be at (3, 2), length 7, score 6.\nH0 is likely moving right or up, lengthening or staying length 5.\nFrom (3, 2), focus on apples (2, 1) and (0, 3). The snake is now positioned ideally to sweep the bottom-left quadrant. We should move DOWN/LEFT toward (2, 1) or (0, 3) next.\n\nLEFT",
