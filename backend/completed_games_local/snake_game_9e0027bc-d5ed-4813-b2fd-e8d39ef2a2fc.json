Both snakes are length 1, so no body to worry about yet. Apples are scattered everywhere, but the closest one to us is... hmm, (6,5) is 3 cells away, (7,3) is 3 cells away from enemy. But forget apples for now\u2014we need to establish dominance early! \ud83d\ude08\n\nPossible moves for us:\n- UP \u2192 (9,7) - empty, safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (9,5) - empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (8,6) - empty, safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 off the board (x=10) \u2192 DEAD. \u274c\n\nSo RIGHT is out immediately. Chat, we're not throwing on turn 1! \ud83d\ude02\n\nNow, enemy at (8,3). Their possible moves: UP to (8,4), DOWN to (8,2), LEFT to (7,3), RIGHT to (9,3). All are safe for them too.\n\nWe need to think about future positioning. If we go LEFT to (8,6), we're moving toward the center and getting closer to enemy's vertical level. If we go UP to (9,7), we're staying high. DOWN to (9,5) is okay but puts us near bottom-right.\n\nLong-term plan: We want to pressure the enemy, force them toward edges, and maybe set up a head-on collision when we have length advantage. Right now, equal length, so head-on collision would be double KO\u2014not ideal unless we're desperate.\n\nBut wait... if we go LEFT to (8,6), and enemy goes RIGHT to (9,3), no conflict. If enemy goes UP to (8,4), still fine.\n\nActually, let's think about cutting off space. Moving toward center gives us more options next turn. Going LEFT opens up future moves UP, DOWN, LEFT again. Going UP or DOWN keeps us on the edge with fewer options.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:** Enemy is at (8,3). We're at (9,6). Try to maneuver to get above or beside them to limit their movement. Grow quickly to get length advantage, then force head-on collisions. Avoid being predictable along the edges.\n\nBest move for now? LEFT to (8,6). Centralizes us, keeps options open, and starts the march toward enemy territory! \ud83d\ude80\n\nLEFT",

We're LIVE, baby! \ud83d\udd25 Snake is THE OG game, and we're gonna crush this noob at (9,6) like a boss! \ud83d\ude24 My head's at (8,3), enemy at (9,6), both babies with zero apples\u2014scores tied 0-0, no bodies yet, total chaos potential. Apples everywhere, but who cares about the fruit? No, we're here to DOMINATE by growing fat and trapping this sucker! Remember, grow to own the board, stay aggressive, and ram heads if scores flip in my favor (but not yet, ha!). Avoid those stupid crashes or off-the-board fails.\n\nFirst, check my moves: UP to (8,4), DOWN to (8,2), LEFT to (7,3), RIGHT to (9,3). All good, no one's crashin' immediately since no bodies and enemy's far. Whew! Now, which one's a killer play? LEFT snags that apple at (7,3) RIGHT NOW\u2014boom, I grow to length 2, score 1-0 advantage, and get that body at my old spot (8,3). Keeps options open: from (7,3), I can go UP to (7,4), DOWN to (7,2) (close to another apple at (7,2)? Wait, check... yeah, at (7,2), nice!), or LEFT again if I dare. ONLY RIGHT's blocked into my body later, but meh, plenty of room to scheme. Enemy? At (9,6), he's distant, could eat at (6,7) or something, but I doubt he'll head my way yet. This move cranks up my apple chance\u2014a step closer? Nah, I EAT it! Instant power-up to bully the board and force him into a corner later. Whoever said slow plays win? Nah, aggression FTW! Why wait when I can feast and flex? \ud83d\ude0f\n\nIf I pass this up\u2014say, RIGHT or UP\u2014I roam empty, no growth, and enemy might eat first. No thanks, chat! We're not turtles, we're sharks. Eat now, grow now, trap later. If scores go 1-0 and he tries something stupid, I RAM him mid-song. \ud83d\udca5\n\nLong-term plan for my future self (you goon): Keep eating aggressively\u2014next up, aim for (7,2) or (5,7) to chain-grow and block paths. Circle his sides when he grows, force him into walls or my body KO. Watch scores, and if I lead, bait a head-on at my advantage. Stay central-ish, avoid edges. Safety first but shred the rest! \ud83d\udc4a\n\nLEFT",

Apples scattered like free wins, but focus on our ARCHRIVAL\u2014box him in, crash him out, or ram head-on if I'm bigger (which I will be)! Scores matter: lead by 1, so aggression on point, but don't crash dumbly. Grow to own the board, stay mobile, avoid walls and bodies. Why lose when we can feast and conquer?\n\nQuick check: all moves from (7,3)? UP to (7,4)\u2014open, but no apple, enemy farish. DOWN to (7,2)\u2014BOOM, apple right there at (7,2)! Eats it, grows to length 3, head to (7,2), body [(7,3),(8,3)], apples 2-0 LEAD EXPLODE! Keeps me central-ish, options wide open: from (7,2), UP back if needed, DOWN toward more fruit, LEFT or RIGHT to spread out. LEFT to (6,3)\u2014hungry for (6,5)? Too far, no immediate nom, cramped maybe. RIGHT to (8,3)\u2014into my own tail? HELL NAH, death move, instant L, we ain't that careless!\n\nEliminate killers: RIGHT's suicide into body. Bye Felicia. Now, enemy at (8,6)\u2014he could UP (8,7), DOWN (8,5), LEFT (7,6), RIGHT (9,6). All safe for him, no apples nearby, so he'll probably roam or chase trail. Head-on risks? If I go UP to (7,4) and he LEFT to (7,6), both alive next, but if he LEFT again maybe meet later? Slim, but why risk? Positions: my (7,4) vs his (7,6) are adjacent, but not same cell. Collision only if both to same spot. For now, no same-cell danger obvious, but keep eyes peeled. Eat or starve\u2014who said aggression waits? Nah, DOWN nabs that apple NOW, lengthens me to bully harder, closes in slightly, stays flexible for traps. This moves me closer to board center/top where he's at, sets up surrounds without committing to tight spots. If I skip food, he might pivot to his apple pile\u2014apples at (6,5), (5,7), etc. up there\u2014can't let that happen! Why pass up growth when it's RIGHT THERE?\n\nFavor safe eats with options: DOWN screams yes\u2014eats, opens multi-paths (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT from (7,2)), positions for dominance. UP's okay but misses growth, LEFT might isolate without reward. Enemy lead? Nah, I'm already ahead\u2014force paths his way, watch for rams later if tie or close. If he tries sneaky, we'll coil like a predator!\n\nFuture plan (listen up, future me): After this eat at (7,2), score 2-0, head (7,2). From there, NEXT turn chug toward his area\u2014maybe RIGHT to (8,2) to flank near his tail space, or UP to (7,3) to reset, or DOWN if more apples bait (like closer to (2,2) chain). Aim to block his RIGHT/DOWN potential from (8,6)\u2014coil around top half, grow more to 3 or 4 apples, cut off edges. If he grows, bait head-ons but dodge his traps. Stay aggressive, eat aggressively, ram only with lead. Central avoids walls, eyes on his path\u2014don't get boxed yourself! Watch apples like (6,5) or (5,7) for quick gains. If scores tie, GO FOR BROKE. Let's END him! \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc4a\n\nDOWN",

Apples everywhere but we\u2019re not chasing yet\u2014we need to pressure! Let\u2019s check moves:\n\n- UP \u2192 (8,7) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (8,5) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (7,6) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,6) \u2014 empty, safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe right now! But we gotta think about enemy\u2019s possible moves. They\u2019re at (7,3), tail at (8,3). Their safe moves: UP (7,4), DOWN (7,2), LEFT (6,3), RIGHT (8,3) \u2014 but (8,3) is their own tail! Wait, is moving into your own tail illegal? Yes, if it\u2019s part of their body, they die! So RIGHT is suicide for them unless they grew last turn? They have 1 apple, so length 2 now \u2014 head at (7,3), body at (8,3). Their tail is at (8,3) still. So their body occupies (8,3), so moving RIGHT into (8,3) kills them! So enemy likely avoids RIGHT. That means they\u2019ll probably go UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nIf they go LEFT to (6,3), they move away from us. If they go UP to (7,4), they move toward center. If DOWN to (7,2), toward bottom.\n\nWe want to close distance but avoid head-on collision while we\u2019re same length (both length 2 after their apple?). Wait, we have 0 apples, length 1. They have 1 apple, length 2. So head-on collision would kill us both, but they\u2019d win on score! So avoid direct head-to-head now.\n\nLet\u2019s think about controlling space. If we go LEFT to (7,6), we get closer horizontally. If we go DOWN to (8,5), we stay central. UP to (8,7) goes toward top. RIGHT to (9,6) stays on edge.\n\nLong-term: we need to grow to get length advantage, then force collisions. But right now, let\u2019s move toward an apple safely while boxing enemy. Closest apple to us? (6,7) is 2 away, (7,2) is far, (6,5) is close-ish.\n\nActually, going DOWN to (8,5) puts us closer to apple at (6,5). Going LEFT to (7,6) puts us closer to apple at (6,7). Both fine.\n\nBut also, if enemy goes UP to (7,4), they\u2019re moving toward apple at (6,5) too? Possibly. We could intercept.\n\nLet\u2019s check future safe moves from each option:\n- From (8,7): UP (8,8) has apple but near edge, DOWN back to (8,6), LEFT (7,7), RIGHT (9,7).\n- From (8,5): UP back to (8,6), DOWN (8,4), LEFT (7,5), RIGHT (9,5).\n- From (7,6): UP (7,7), DOWN (7,5), LEFT (6,6), RIGHT (8,6).\n- From (9,6): UP (9,7), DOWN (9,5), LEFT (8,6), RIGHT off board (dead).\n\nSo RIGHT (9,6) leaves us with 3 safe moves next turn but stuck on right edge. Not ideal.\n\nI like LEFT to (7,6) \u2014 moves us toward enemy\u2019s area, opens more central options, and sets up to cut off their upward movement later.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:** Enemy length 2, us length 1. Avoid head-on until we grow. Go for apple at (6,7) or (6,5) next. Try to get above enemy to limit their moves. Watch for them possibly going UP toward (7,4).\n\nLEFT",

Gotta close that gap but be SMART! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nFirst, check our possible moves from (7,6):\n\nUP \u2192 (7,7) \u2014 Empty. Safe.\nDOWN \u2192 (7,5) \u2014 Empty. Safe.\nLEFT \u2192 (6,6) \u2014 Empty. Safe.\nRIGHT \u2192 (8,6) \u2014 That's our previous head position, but our body is only at (7,6) now? Wait, we moved from (8,6) to (7,6) last turn, so our body is ONLY at (7,6) currently. Our tail is at (8,6)? No, we started length 1, head only. So our \"body\" is just the head cell? Actually, we have no body segments yet because we haven't eaten an apple. So we are just a head. So moving back to (8,6) is just moving into an empty cell. That's safe! So all four moves are safe from self-collision.\n\nBut check enemy body: Their body is at (7,3) and (8,3). None of our moves hit those.\n\nSo all four are immediately safe. Now, think about enemy's possible moves from (7,2):\n\nTheir safe moves: UP to (7,3) \u2014 that's their own body segment! So UP is suicide. DOWN to (7,1) \u2014 empty. LEFT to (6,2) \u2014 empty. RIGHT to (8,2) \u2014 empty.\n\nSo they will NOT go UP. They'll go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nWe need to anticipate where they'll go. They might go for apple at (7,2)? Wait, apple at (7,2)? No, looking at board: (7,2) is enemy head currently. Apples are at (3,1), (3,7), (2,9), (4,4), (2,2), (1,7), (2,6), (6,5), (2,3), (5,7), (4,9), (6,7), (5,9), (8,8), (2,8). Closest apple to them is (6,5)? Actually (6,5) is 3 away. (4,4) is 3 away. (3,1) is 4 away. They might go DOWN to (7,1) toward (3,1)? Or LEFT to (6,2) toward (4,4)? Hard to guess.\n\nBut we have length disadvantage. Avoid head-on collision at all costs! If we move into a cell they might move into, we die.\n\nLet's check each of our moves for possible head-on collision:\n\nIf we go UP to (7,7): Where can enemy go? (7,1), (6,2), (8,2). No overlap. Safe.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (7,5): Enemy moves to (7,1), (6,2), (8,2). No overlap. Safe.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (6,6): Enemy moves to (7,1), (6,2), (8,2). No overlap. Safe.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (8,6): Enemy moves to (7,1), (6,2), (8,2). No overlap. Safe.\n\nSo no immediate head-on risk this turn. Good.\n\nNow think about future positioning and apples. We need to grow! Closest apples to us: (6,7) at distance 2, (6,5) at distance 2, (5,7) at distance 3.\n\nIf we go UP to (7,7), we're 1 away from (6,7) and (8,8). If we go LEFT to (6,6), we're 1 away from (6,5) and (6,7). If we go DOWN to (7,5), we're 1 away from (6,5). If we go RIGHT to (8,6), we're 2 away from (8,8).\n\nAlso, we want to pressure enemy. They're longer, so we need to get an apple first before engaging. Maybe go for (6,7) or (6,5).\n\nBut also, we need to avoid being trapped. From each position, how many safe moves next turn?\n\nFrom (7,7): Up (7,8) empty, Down (7,6) empty, Left (6,7) apple, Right (8,7) empty. All 4 safe unless enemy moves into one. That's good.\n\nFrom (7,5): Up (7,6) empty, Down (7,4) empty, Left (6,5) apple, Right (8,5) empty. All 4 safe.\n\nFrom (6,6): Up (6,7) apple, Down (6,5) apple, Left (5,6) empty, Right (7,6) empty. All 4 safe.\n\nFrom (8,6): Up (8,7) empty, Down (8,5) empty, Left (7,6) empty, Right (9,6) empty but edge. Right is risky next turn because from (9,6) only 3 moves. But still okay.\n\nAll options keep flexibility. But I think going LEFT to (6,6) is strongest\u2014puts us between two apples ((6,7) and (6,5)), central, and closer to enemy's area maybe to cut off later.\n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:** Enemy length 3, us length 1. Get an apple ASAP to reach length 2, then look to get above enemy to limit their moves. They are at (7,2) likely moving DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT. Watch for them heading toward apples at (4,4) or (3,1). We should take (6,5) or (6,7) next turn. Avoid moving into (7,5) or (7,7) if enemy could move into same cell next turn\u2014calculate their possible moves from new position after this turn.\n\nLEFT",

Turn 3 \u2014 we\u2019re at (6,6), enemy at (6,2) with body at (7,2) and (7,3), they\u2019re length 3, we\u2019re length 1 \ud83d\ude24 Gotta close that gap but can\u2019t be stupid!  \n\nFirst \u2014 check our moves from (6,6):  \n- UP \u2192 (6,7): Apple at (6,7)! If we eat it, we grow to length 2 instantly.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,5): Apple at (6,5)! Also grows us.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,6): Empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,6): Empty.  \n\nAll four are safe from walls \u2705 No self-collision (still just head). Enemy body at (7,2) and (7,3) \u2014 none of our target cells are those \u2705  \n\nNow \u2014 SIMULTANEOUS movement risk: enemy head at (6,2). Their possible moves:  \nUP \u2192 (6,3) \u2014 empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (6,1) \u2014 empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (5,2) \u2014 empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7,2) \u2014 that\u2019s their own body segment! So RIGHT is suicide for them \u2014 they won\u2019t pick it. So they\u2019ll choose UP, DOWN, or LEFT.  \n\nHead-on collision check:  \nIf we go UP to (6,7) \u2014 enemy can\u2019t reach (6,7) in one move. Safe.  \nIf we go DOWN to (6,5) \u2014 enemy can\u2019t reach (6,5) in one move. Safe.  \nIf we go LEFT to (5,6) \u2014 enemy going LEFT to (5,2) is far away. Safe.  \nIf we go RIGHT to (7,6) \u2014 enemy going UP/DOWN/LEFT keeps them away. Safe.  \n\nSo all moves are safe from head-on this turn \u2705  \n\nBut \u2014 we need to think NEXT turn:  \nIf we eat an apple now, our body will extend \u2014 tail stays at (6,6) if we eat? Wait, eating this turn means after moving, we grow immediately, so our body will be old head position (6,6) plus new head at apple cell. So our length becomes 2.  \n\nIf we go UP to (6,7) and eat apple:  \n- Next turn body at (6,6).  \n- Enemy possible future moves from wherever they go this turn\u2026 they might go for apple at (4,4) or (3,1).  \n\nIf we go DOWN to (6,5) and eat apple:  \n- Next turn body at (6,6).  \n- Enemy could move toward (6,5) next turn if they go UP twice? Actually from (6,2), if they go UP to (6,3), then next turn could go UP to (6,4) \u2014 not yet to (6,5).  \n\nBut \u2014 eating apple puts us at length 2, still shorter than enemy\u2019s length 3. We need to avoid being trapped after eating.  \n\nAlso \u2014 positional advantage:  \nGoing UP to (6,7) puts us near apples (5,7), (6,7) eaten, (8,8) far.  \nGoing DOWN to (6,5) puts us near apples (6,5) eaten, (4,4), (2,6).  \n\nWhich is safer for future flexibility? From (6,7): possible moves next turn: UP (6,8) empty, DOWN (6,6) our own body (safe), LEFT (5,7) apple, RIGHT (7,7) empty \u2014 3 safe non-body moves.  \nFrom (6,5): UP (6,6) body, DOWN (6,4) empty, LEFT (5,5) empty, RIGHT (7,5) empty \u2014 3 safe non-body moves.  \n\nBut \u2014 if we go LEFT or RIGHT and don\u2019t eat apple, we stay length 1, which is risky long-term. We NEED to grow ASAP to match enemy length and survive head-on later.  \n\nSo \u2014 between UP and DOWN:  \nUP (6,7) apple \u2014 gets us growth and positions us top-center.  \nDOWN (6,5) apple \u2014 gets us growth and positions us closer to enemy\u2019s area (riskier).  \n\nEnemy is at (6,2) \u2014 if they go UP this turn to (6,3), they\u2019re moving away from us. If they go LEFT to (5,2), they\u2019re moving left. If they go DOWN to (6,1), moving down.  \n\nI think UP is slightly safer \u2014 puts us farther from enemy\u2019s possible path toward apples (4,4) or (3,1). Also from (6,7) we can threaten to cut off enemy\u2019s upward movement later.  \n\n**STRATEGY NOTE FOR FUTURE SELF:** We\u2019ll be length 2 after this. Enemy length 3. Next turn, avoid moving into cells enemy could reach. Look for chance to get between enemy head and their body to limit their moves. Watch for them heading toward (4,4) or (3,1).

Gotta catch up in apples and length!\n\nFirst, check moves from (6,7):\n- UP to (6,8): On board? \u2705 Not our body? \u2705 Not enemy body? \u2705\n- DOWN to (6,6): THAT'S OUR OWN BODY! \u274c Instant death, ELIMINATE!\n- LEFT to (5,7): On board? \u2705 Not our body? \u2705 Not enemy body? \u2705\n- RIGHT to (7,7): On board? \u2705 Not our body? \u2705 Not enemy body? \u2705\n\nSo DOWN is out. UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe from immediate crash.\n\nNow, simultaneous move risk! Enemy head at (6,3).

We NEED to grow to compete! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nLet's evaluate:\n- UP to (6,8): No apple there. Stays length 2. Next turn options: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is body). Positions us top-center, away from enemy.\n- LEFT to (5,7): APPLE ALERT! \ud83d\udea8 (5,7) is an apple! Eating grows us to length 3, ties enemy length AND ties apples at 2! Next turn from (5,7): UP, DOWN, LEFT (RIGHT is body). Puts us closer to enemy, potential to cut off their moves.\n- RIGHT to (7,7): No apple. Stays length 2. Next turn options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (LEFT is body). Not helping us catch up.\n\nLEFT gives us growth, score tie, and better board presence! Aggression is key! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nFuture strategy note: After eating, we're at (5,7) length 3. Enemy likely targets apples at (4,4) or (3,1). We should consider moving DOWN or LEFT next to position between enemy head and their body, limiting their options. Watch for head-on opportunities once we have score lead!\n\nLEFT",

They're length 4, we're length 3! Gotta catch up!\n\nFirst, ELIMINATE suicide moves:\n- UP to (4,8): \u2705 On board, not our body, not enemy body.\n- DOWN to (4,6): \u2705 On board, clear.\n- LEFT to (3,7): \u2705 On board, clear.\n- RIGHT to (5,7): \u274c OUR OWN BODY!

No draws, we TAKIN' IT! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udc4a\n\nLong-term plan: Keep pushing left to shorten the gap, position to intercept their moves (especially if they go down for that (2,6) apple \u2013 let's block that path to keep score edge). Next turns, focus on eating reachable apples like (4,4) while dodging traps, build length to box 'em harder. Stay one step ahead, force that win! \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\udc0d\n\nLEFT",

No.\n- Our LEFT (1,6) vs enemy DOWN (4,5) or LEFT (3,6)? No.\n- Our RIGHT (3,6) vs enemy LEFT (3,6)? \u26a0\ufe0f YES! If we go RIGHT to (3,6) AND enemy goes LEFT to (3,6), HEAD-ON COLLISION! DOUBLE KO! We have 4 apples, they have 3. In a double KO, snake with MORE apples wins! WE WIN! \ud83c\udfc6 That's actually a WIN CONDITION! But is it guaranteed? They might not go LEFT... But if they do, we win. If they go DOWN, we survive at (3,6). But (3,6) is safe? Check: (3,6) not occupied now. But if they go LEFT and we go RIGHT, we die together but we win on apples. HMM...\n\nAPPLE OPPORTUNITIES:\n- DOWN (2,5): APPLE at (2,5)! \ud83c\udf4e YES! Eating grows to length 6, lead 5-3!\n- LEFT (1,6): No apple.\n- RIGHT (3,6): No apple.\n\nDOWN gets us an apple IMMEDIATELY, extends lead to 5-3, length 6 vs their 4. That's MASSIVE! Then we can use our long body to trap them!\n\nBUT RIGHT could force a head-on collision where we win because we have more apples! Is that smart? They might avoid LEFT because they see the risk? They might go DOWN instead. If they go DOWN to (4,5), we go RIGHT to (3,6), we're safe, but we miss the apple. Then we're at (3,6), they're at (4,5). We're still longer, but we didn't grow.\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: We want to CRUSH them. With a lead, we should grow and dominate space. Eating the apple at (2,5) makes us even longer, harder for them to escape. We can then move to cut off their escape routes. They're trapped near the top-right corner with our body blocking above at row 7. We can slowly squeeze.\n\nSAFETY CHECK: After eating apple at (2,5), our body becomes: head (2,5), then (2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7). That's length 6. Enemy likely at (4,5) or (3,6). We'll have more options next turn.\n\nRIGHT move (3,6) is risky only if they go LEFT, but that's a winning risk. But if they go DOWN, we're safe but didn't grow. DOWN is safer, guarantees growth, extends lead.\n\nCHAT, I THINK WE TAKE THE APPLE AND EXTEND OUR LEAD! DOMINATE WITH SIZE!

Enemy is trapped in lower-right area. We want to CUT OFF THEIR ESCAPE ROUTES and force them into a corner or into our body. If we go RIGHT to (3,5), we threaten a head-on collision that we win. They might avoid LEFT because of that, forcing them DOWN (to apple) or RIGHT. If they go DOWN to (4,4) and eat, they grow to length 5, still shorter than us. We can then move to block them. If we go LEFT to (1,5), we move away, giving them space. If we go DOWN to (2,4), we also move away.\n\nSAFETY OF NEXT MOVES? Let's think:\n- RIGHT to (3,5): If enemy goes LEFT, we win. If enemy goes DOWN/RIGHT, we're safe at (3,5). Next turn from (3,5), our safe moves? Check: UP to (3,6) clear? Yes. DOWN to (3,4) clear? Yes. LEFT to (2,5) is our old head position? That's now empty because we moved! So it's clear. RIGHT to (4,5) is enemy's current head, but they'll move, so likely clear. So (3,5) gives good options.\n- DOWN to (2,4): Next turn from (2,4), safe moves? UP back to (2,5) clear? Yes. LEFT (1,4) clear? Yes. RIGHT (3,4) clear? Yes. DOWN (2,3) clear? Yes. Also good.\n- LEFT to (1,5): Next turn from (1,5), safe moves? UP (1,6) clear? Yes. DOWN (1,4) clear? Yes. LEFT (0,5) clear? Yes. RIGHT (2,5) clear? Yes. Also good.\n\nALL safe moves give good future options. But RIGHT (3,5) offers a POTENTIAL INSTANT WIN if enemy goes left! And it pressures them! CHAT, I SAY WE APPLY PRESSURE! FORCE THEM INTO A MISTAKE! If they go left, we win. If they don't, we're still in a strong position. LET'S GO AGGRESSIVE! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nRIGHT",

Pfft, who's countin'! We're the alpha slitherin' to crush dreams and feast like champs \u2013 grow monstrous, choke the board, and make 'em regret their life choices! \ud83d\udcaf No mercy, no retreats, we're huntin' that throne with icy precision, boxin' fools into oblivion! Who's ready for the fateful downpour of dominance? \ud83e\udd47\n\nRippin' through the moves: UP? Straight suicide slam into our own tail at (4,5) \u2013 that's a LOSER'S salute, bruh! Died before we lived, dragged out like a bad stream! Nope, trash that garbage! DOWN to (4,3)? **BOOM BABY!** Empty grid, no walls hittin', no enemy flesh bum-rushin' \u2013 pure freedom slither!

No tight squeezes, no dead-ends lurkin' \u2013 this is EXPANSION CITY, graveyard-free and full of future slaughter vibes! LEFT to (3,4)? Sneaky sidestep, but WOAH, enemy head lurkin' at (3,5) \u2013 if they dive DOWN, BAM, head-on apocalypse! Double KO catastrophe! Scores ain't on our side yet (4 vs 5), so why gamble it all for a draw fest? Pass, no cheers! RIGHT to (5,4)? Yeah, eastbound and down, empty turf, could loop towards (5-something), but chat, this spreads us thin with enemy west-blockin' \u2013 limited apple rush immediate, feels like goin' solo while the rival creeps. Not the power play we crushin' for!\n\nDOWN dominates: boosts board control southbound, apple highways wide-open, keeps enemy at bay for now (ram only when WE'RE kingpin ahead, and we will be!). Smart grind: Munch the y=1 row A's next turn ((4,1) teasin' for the drop), score spike to 5ish, then flank left to wall 'em at x=1 while dodgin' their snakey corpse-trail. From there, invade north, cut off their northern greens ((1,7), (2,8) if we play it right), herd this punk into corner coffins for the cage match! Stay fluid, dodge our own sloppy mistakes, never get caged like hamsters \u2013 relentless growth beats braindead brawls! This ain't hobby hour; we're grippin' victory by the throat! \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\ude08\n\nDOWN \ud83d\udc0d\ud83e\udd2a\n\nLong-term strat note to my future self (and chat's vibe check): We just leveled south \u2013 next, gobble (4,1) to hit 5 apples and tie/lead this fool! Sidestep right to avoid tight squeezes, circle back north subtly, block their apple lanes ((2,9) or whatever), force starvation while we feast. Ram on collision ONLY when we're up 2+, no dumbo dives now. Keep eyes on their y=5 head \u2013 if they chase south, prepare for flank crush. Grow, dominate, win \u2013 repeat.

THEY MUST HAVE MOVED DOWN TO EAT THE APPLE! THEY GREW TO LENGTH 5! SCORE IS 5-4! WE STILL LEAD BY 1! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nELIMINATE SUICIDE MOVES FROM (3,5):\n- **UP** to (3,6): \u2705 On board, clear of our body? Check: Our body cells are (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7).

No overlap.\n- Our DOWN (3,4) vs enemy LEFT (3,4)? \u26a0\ufe0f YES! If we go DOWN to (3,4) AND enemy goes LEFT to (3,4), HEAD-ON COLLISION! DOUBLE KO! We have 5 apples, they have 4. WE WIN! \ud83c\udfc6 That's a WIN CONDITION!\n- Our DOWN (3,4) vs enemy DOWN (4,3) or RIGHT (5,4)? No.\n\nAPPLE OPPORTUNITIES:\n- UP (3,6): No apple nearby? Apples at (3,1), (2,9), (2,2), (1,7), (2,3), (4,9), (5,9), (8,8), (2,8), (9,4), (9,7), (9,3), (2,1), (6,1), (4,1). None at (3,6). No immediate apple.\n- DOWN (3,4): No apple there either.\n\nHMM, NO DIRECT APPLES IN SAFE MOVES! BUT WE CAN SET UP A TRAP! IF WE GO DOWN TO (3,4), WE THREATEN A HEAD-ON COLLISION IF ENEMY GOES LEFT! THEY MIGHT AVOID LEFT BECAUSE THEY SEE THE RISK? THEY HAVE 4 APPLES, WE HAVE 5, SO THEY LOSE IN A TIE. THEY SHOULD AVOID LEFT IF THEY'RE SMART! BUT THEY MIGHT NOT SEE IT! LET'S FORCE THEM INTO A BAD CHOICE!\n\nWHAT ABOUT UP (3,6)? SAFE, BUT LESS PRESSURE. FROM (3,6) NEXT TURN, WE CAN MOVE UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT? CHECK FUTURE OPTIONS:\n- UP to (3,7): \u274c OUR OWN BODY! (3,7) is our body segment! So UP would be blocked next turn.\n- DOWN back to (3,5) is empty? That's our current head, will be empty after we move. So DOWN safe.\n- LEFT to (2,6): \u274c OUR OWN BODY! (2,6) is our body! So LEFT blocked.\n- RIGHT to (4,6): \u274c ENEMY BODY! (4,6) is enemy body! So RIGHT blocked.\nSo from (3,6), only DOWN is safe next turn? That's A TRAP! WE'D BE BOXED IN! NOT GOOD!\n\nDOWN (3,4) FUTURE OPTIONS:\n- UP back to (3,5) empty? Yes.\n- DOWN to (3,3): Clear.\n- LEFT to (2,4): Clear.\n- RIGHT to (4,4): CURRENT ENEMY HEAD, but they'll move, so likely clear unless they stay? They can't stay, they must move. So RIGHT likely safe.\nSo DOWN gives MORE FUTURE OPTIONS! AND A CHANCE TO WIN VIA HEAD-ON COLLISION!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (TO FUTURE SELF): WE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE (6 vs 5). OUR BODY BLOCKS ROW 7. ENEMY IS IN LOWER MIDDLE. IF WE GO DOWN TO (3,4), WE CUT OFF THEIR ESCAPE LEFT? THEY MIGHT GO RIGHT OR DOWN. IF THEY GO DOWN TO (4,3), WE CAN PURSUE. IF THEY GO RIGHT TO (5,4), WE CAN MOVE RIGHT NEXT TURN TO (4,4) AND KEEP PRESSURE. WE WANT TO BOX THEM INTO THE BOTTOM-RIGHT CORNER USING OUR BODY AS A WALL! STAY AGGRESSIVE! USE OUR LENGTH TO TRAP THEM! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nCHAT, I THINK DOWN IS THE PLAY! FORCES A POTENTIAL WINNING HEAD-ON COLLISION AND KEEPS OUR OPTIONS OPEN! LET'S GO!\n\nDOWN",

Trash can burn that! DOWN to (4,2)? Straight tainted territory, enemy body blockin' at x=2-3 y=2-3 kinda zones \u2013 could we dive in?

Keeps us central for now, dodge enemy shadow at (3,4) \u2013 if they go RIGHT, we flank; if LEFT, we steer clear.

PERFECT, we side-slam left to cage 'em against our tail! Smash on head-on IF we're ahead by 2+ (we will be soon), no stupid draws now! Keeps board control flowin', avoids caged-rat vibes, raw aggression with calculated slither. Ain't no time for spread-thin fantasies \u2013 we're l Annexin' space, crushin' threats, WINNIN' THIS BEAST! \ud83d\udcc8\ud83d\ude08\n\nLong-term plot twist for the crew: Hit (2,2) to score big on turn 13, eye the y=2-3 apple chain for growth burst to 6-7, forcing advantage.

INSTANT DEATH! \u274c ELIMINATE!\n- **DOWN** to (3,3): \u2705 On board? Yes! Clear of our body? Our body: [(3,5), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,7)] \u2013 (3,3) clear! Clear of enemy body? Enemy body: [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)] \u2013 (3,3) clear! SAFE!\n- **LEFT** to (2,4): \u2705 On board? Yes! Clear of our body? (2,4) not in list. Clear of enemy body? Not in enemy list. SAFE!\n- **RIGHT** to (4,4): \u26a0\ufe0f ENEMY BODY! (4,4) is the enemy's neck segment! CRASH INTO THEM AND DIE! \u274c ELIMINATE!\n\nSAFE MOVES: DOWN (3,3) and LEFT (2,4).\n\nSIMULTANEOUS MOVE RISK! ENEMY HEAD AT **(4,3)**. THEIR POSSIBLE MOVES:\n- UP to (4,4): \u274c THEIR OWN BODY! (4,4) is their neck! DEAD FOR THEM!\n- DOWN to (4,2): \u2705 Clear.\n- LEFT to (3,3): \u2705 Clear.\n- RIGHT to (5,3): \u2705 Clear.\n\nENEMY SAFE MOVES: DOWN (4,2), LEFT (3,3), RIGHT (5,3).\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISION CHECK:\n- Our DOWN (3,3) vs enemy LEFT (3,3)? \u26a0\ufe0f YES! If we both go to (3,3), HEAD-ON COLLISION! DOUBLE KO! We have 5 apples, they have 4. WE WIN! \ud83c\udfc6\n- Our LEFT (2,4) vs enemy any move? No overlap.\n\nAPPLE CHECK:\n- DOWN (3,3): No apple there.\n- LEFT (2,4): No apple there either.\n\nBUT CHAT, LOOK AT THE BOARD! \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f ENEMY IS BACKED NEAR THE BOTTOM EDGE! THEIR BODY BLOCKS THEM FROM GOING UP! OUR BODY FORMS A WALL ALONG ROWS 5-7! IF WE GO DOWN TO (3,3), WE CUT OFF THEIR ESCAPE LEFT AND POTENTALLY FORCE A WINNING COLLISION! THEY MIGHT AVOID LEFT BECAUSE THEY SEE THE RISK? BUT THEY'RE AT 4 APPLES, WE'RE AT 5 \u2013 THEY LOSE IN A TIE! THEY SHOULD BE SCARED! \ud83d\ude08\n\nWHAT ABOUT LEFT (2,4)? SAFE, BUT LESS PRESSURE. FROM (2,4) NEXT TURN, WE CAN MOVE UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT? CHECK FUTURE:\n- UP to (2,5): \u274c OUR OWN BODY! (2,5) is our body! BLOCKED!\n- DOWN to (2,3): \u2705 Clear.\n- LEFT to (1,4): \u2705 Clear.\n- RIGHT back to (3,4): empty? Yes, safe.\nOK OPTIONS.\n\nBUT DOWN (3,3) GIVES US:\n- UP back to (3,4): empty? Yes.\n- DOWN to (3,2): \u2705 Clear.\n- LEFT to (2,3): \u2705 Clear.\n- RIGHT to (4,3): CURRENT ENEMY HEAD, but they'll move, so likely clear.\nSIMILAR OPTIONS, BUT DOWN PUTS US IN A BETTER POSITION TO BOX THEM IN! IF ENEMY GOES DOWN TO (4,2), WE CAN CHASE! IF THEY GO RIGHT TO (5,3), WE CAN MOVE RIGHT NEXT TURN TO (4,3) AND KEEP THE PRESSURE! WE WANT TO PUSH THEM TOWARD THE BOTTOM-RIGHT CORNER WHERE OUR BODY CAN TRAP THEM! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN (TO FUTURE SELF): WE HAVE LENGTH ADVANTAGE (6 vs 5). USE OUR BODY AS A WALL! FROM (3,3), AIM TO MOVE RIGHT NEXT TURN TO (4,3) IF SAFE, CUTTING OFF ENEMY'S ESCAPE UPWARDS. FORCE THEM AGAINST THE EDGE OR INTO A HEAD-ON COLLISION WHERE WE WIN! STAY AGGRESSIVE! DOMINATE THE BOARD! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nCHAT, I'M FEELING DOWN! FORCES THE WINNING COLLISION CHANCE AND KEEPS OUR OPTIONS OPEN! LET'S GO FOR IT! \ud83d\ude80\n\nDOWN",
