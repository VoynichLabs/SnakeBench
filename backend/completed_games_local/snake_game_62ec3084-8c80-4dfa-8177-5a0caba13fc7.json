Enemy snake #1 is at (5,3) with its body at (5,2), so it's directly below the apple at (5,4).\n\n## Move Safety Check\n\n- **UP to (3,7)**: Safe (no snakes there)\n- **DOWN to (3,5)**: Safe (no snakes there)\n- **LEFT to (2,6)**: Safe (no snakes there)\n- **RIGHT to (4,6)**: Safe (no snakes there)\n\nAll moves are safe.\n\n## Strategic Considerations\n\nThe apple at (5,4) is the primary target. The enemy is at (5,3), so it's closer to that apple than I am. I need to position myself to reach another apple or cut off the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apple distribution:\n- (5,4) - directly above enemy's head\n- (3,4) - 2 cells directly below me\n- (9,2) - far right\n- (9,3) - far right\n- (9,1) - far right\n\nThe apple at (3,4) is the closest to me. Moving DOWN would put me directly above it, which could be a good approach.\n\n## Future Planning\n\nThe enemy is very close to the apple at (5,4). I should move DOWN to (3,5) to position myself to collect the apple at (3,4) on my next move, while keeping distance from the enemy. This also opens up options to move left or right after collecting that apple.\n\n**Plan:** Move DOWN to (3,5), then DOWN again to collect the apple at (3,4) on the next turn, then move towards the right side where multiple apples are clustered.\n\nDOWN",

SAFE.\n\nI have three safe options: UP, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\n**Evaluating the safe moves:**\n\nLooking at the board and enemy position:\n- Moving LEFT to (4,2) gets me an apple immediately! This would put me at 6 apples, tying the enemy snake.\n- Moving UP to (5,3) moves away from the enemy but doesn't get an apple.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6,2) moves away from the enemy but doesn't get an apple.\n- The enemy snake at (2,2) could move UP to (2,3), RIGHT to (3,2), or DOWN to (2,1).\n- Moving LEFT to get the apple at (4,2) is the most advantageous move - it immediately gains an apple and ties the score.\n- After getting the apple, my snake will grow, which could help block the enemy or create space for future maneuvers.\n\n**LEFT to (4,2)** is the clear best choice because:\n1. It gets me an apple immediately, tying the score at 6-6\n2. It's safe from the enemy snake\n3. Growing from the apple gives me more body to work with\n4.
