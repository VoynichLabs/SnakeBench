Enemy at (0,2) could move RIGHT to (1,2) or UP/DOWN/LEFT. It can't reach (6,2) in one move. So safe.\n\n2. **DOWN (6,0):**  \n   - On board.  \n   - No self-collision.  \n   - Enemy can't reach (6,0) in one move. Safe.\n\n3. **LEFT (5,1):**  \n   - On board.  \n   - No self-collision.  \n   - Enemy can't reach (5,1) in one move. Safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT (7,1):**  \n   - On board.  \n   - No self-collision.  \n   - Enemy can't reach (7,1) in one move. Safe.\n\nAll four moves are immediately safe.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**  \nWe want to move toward apples while keeping future options open.  \nClosest apples to (6,1):  \n- (5,5) is 4 units away (Manhattan distance: |6-5|+|1-5| = 1+4=5? Wait, recalc: |6-5|=1, |1-5|=4, total 5).  \n- (5,6) is distance 6.  \n- (0,5) is far.  \n- (9,6) far.  \n- (8,8) far.\n\nActually, (5,5) is closest in Manhattan distance (5 steps).  \nFrom (6,1), moving LEFT to (5,1) reduces x-distance to 0, y-distance still 4 \u2192 total 4 steps left.  \nMoving UP to (6,2) reduces y-distance to 3, x-distance 1 \u2192 total 4 steps left.  \nSo both UP and LEFT reduce Manhattan distance to (5,5) by 1.\n\nBut also consider board space:  \n- UP (6,2): From there, can go UP again toward apple, or LEFT/RIGHT.  \n- LEFT (5,1): From there, can go UP toward apple, or LEFT/DOWN.  \nBoth keep options open.\n\nEnemy snake at (0,2) is far away, so no immediate collision risk.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:**  \nHead toward (5,5) or (5,6) area, but be aware that enemy may also move toward apples at (0,5) or others. Keep central-ish mobility, avoid getting trapped in corners early.\n\n**Choice:**  \nI'll choose **LEFT** to (5,1) because it moves me closer to the nearest apple (5,5) horizontally and still allows upward movement next turn.\n\nLEFT",

Moving UP keeps me on this productive column. The board is open, so all directions keep many options open for next turn.\n\n**Enemy consideration:** Snake #1 is at (0,5). It might move toward the apple at (0,5) (which is actually at its head's location\u2014wait, the board shows an apple at (0,5)? Looking at the board state, there's a '1' at (0,5), which is the enemy snake's head, not an apple. The listed apples are (5,6), (9,6), (8,8), (5,5), (7,9). So no apple at (0,5). The enemy is far and not an immediate concern.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Continue moving upward toward the apples at (5,5) and (5,6). This is the most efficient path to gain points early. Stay aware of the enemy's position, but for now, focus on growth.\n\n**Final decision:** UP is the most direct move toward the nearest apples while keeping future options open.\n\nUP",

This is within bounds and not occupied by any snake. It is safe.\n\n**Strategy Analysis:**\n*   **Positioning**: I am currently on the left edge of the board (x=0). Staying on the edge limits my movement options and increases the risk of getting trapped by my own tail or an opponent.\n*   **Targeting**: The nearest apples are at (5, 5) and (5, 6).

It brings me closer to the y-coordinate of the food, but doesn't help me escape the edge.\n    *   **RIGHT**: Moves me to (1, 5). This moves me away from the wall and into the open center of the board. It significantly reduces the Manhattan distance to the apple at (5, 5) (from 5 to 4). This aligns with standard A* pathfinding heuristics which prioritize moving towards the target while maximizing available space (safety checks).\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **RIGHT** is the superior choice. It is safe, avoids the trap of the wall, and takes the most direct step towards the nearest cluster of apples.\n\nStrategy Note: I will continue moving towards the center of the board to target the apple at (5, 5).

While the tail will move forward this turn (since I didn't eat), the rules explicitly state: *\"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"* This is a forbidden move. **LEFT is fatal.**\n2.  **UP to (1, 6):** Safe.

This is generally inefficient for scoring.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 5):** Moves me towards the center of the board (increasing x coordinate).\n    *   It reduces the Manhattan distance to the apple at (5, 5) from 4 to 3.\n    *   It creates better mobility. From (2, 5), I have neighbors at (2, 4), (2, 6), and (3, 5) available for future moves. From (1, 6), the wall at x=0 restricts one side.\n    *   **Enemy Consideration:** The enemy is at (5, 4).

Safe (eating is allowed).\n- **DOWN** to (5,4): Contains my own tail. **UNSAFE** (moving into my own body).\n- **LEFT** to (4,5): Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT** to (6,5): Empty. Safe.\n\nSo DOWN is eliminated. UP, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Apple positions:** (5,6), (9,6), (8,8), (7,9), (4,5)\n- UP leads directly to apple (5,6). This would give me a second apple and grow my length to 3.\n- LEFT moves toward apple (4,5), which is one cell away diagonally (LEFT then DOWN, or DOWN then LEFT). However, moving LEFT to (4,5) does not collect it this turn.\n- RIGHT moves away from most apples, though there are apples in the far right columns.\n\n**Enemy snake (#1):** Head at (2,5), body at (1,5). It could move UP to (2,6), DOWN to (2,4), LEFT to (1,5) (into its own body, unsafe), or RIGHT to (3,5). Its safe moves are UP, DOWN, RIGHT. It might aim for apple (4,5) or (5,6). If it moves RIGHT to (3,5), it could be heading toward (4,5). There is no immediate head-on collision risk for me this turn, as our heads are not adjacent.\n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**\n- **UP to (5,6)**: After eating, my body will be head at (5,6), then (5,5), tail at (5,4). Next turn, I must avoid moving DOWN into (5,5). The board around (5,6) is open: UP to (5,7) empty, LEFT to (4,6) empty, RIGHT to (6,6) empty. Good mobility.\n- **LEFT to (4,5)**: My head moves to empty cell. Body becomes head at (4,5), then (5,5), tail at (5,4). Next turn, I must avoid moving RIGHT into (5,5). From (4,5), possible moves: UP to (4,6) empty, DOWN to (4,4) empty, LEFT to (3,5) empty. Good mobility, and puts me closer to apple (4,5) for next turn.\n- **RIGHT to (6,5)**: Moves away from most apples. Body becomes head at (6,5), then (5,5), tail at (5,4). Next turn, must avoid LEFT into (5,5). From (6,5), moves: UP to (6,6) empty, DOWN to (6,4) empty, RIGHT to (7,5) empty. Mobility is good, but I'm moving away from the cluster of apples.\n\n**Risk of head-on collision:** Enemy at (2,5) could move RIGHT to (3,5). If I move LEFT to (4,5), we would be two cells apart. No direct collision this turn. If enemy moves RIGHT and I move LEFT, we would be at (3,5) and (4,5) respectively, not colliding. Safe.\n\n**Strategic consideration:** Collecting apples quickly is key. UP gives an immediate apple and positions me well for future apples in the upper half (like (7,9), (8,8)). LEFT sets me up for apple (4,5) next turn, but that apple is also reachable by the enemy. Since enemy is at (2,5), it could potentially reach (4,5) in two moves (RIGHT to (3,5), then RIGHT to (4,5)). If I move LEFT, I am one step away from (4,5); next turn I could move DOWN to (4,4) or UP to (4,6), but to get the apple I'd need to move DOWN to (4,4)?? Wait, apple is at (4,5). If I move LEFT to (4,5) now, I do not collect it because it's not an apple at my destination? Actually, apple list includes (4,5). So moving LEFT to (4,5) **would** collect that apple! I missed that. Yes, (4,5) is an apple. So both UP and LEFT lead to an apple this turn.\n\nNow comparing apples: UP to (5,6) vs LEFT to (4,5). Both give +1 apple. Which is better?\n\n**After eating apple at (4,5):** My body: head (4,5), then (5,5), tail (5,4). Next turn, I must avoid moving RIGHT into (5,5). From (4,5), I could go UP to (4,6) (empty), DOWN to (4,4) (empty), LEFT to (3,5) (empty). Good mobility. The enemy might also be targeting (4,5), but I would claim it this turn.\n\n**Which apple is safer?** The apple at (5,6) is farther from the enemy. The enemy would need at least two moves to reach (5,6) (e.g., RIGHT to (3,5), then UP to (3,6), then RIGHT to (4,6), then RIGHT to (5,6)? Actually from (2,5) to (5,6) is 3 moves minimum). The apple at (4,5) is closer to the enemy. However, since I can collect it this turn, there's no conflict.\n\n**Potential head-on collision risk if both go for same apple?** Apples are separate, so no.\n\n**Long-term plan:** After this turn, I will have length 3. I should continue to collect apples while maintaining mobility. The board is still open. I should consider moving toward the cluster of apples in the upper right (7,9), (8,8), (9,6) after securing nearby ones.\n\n**Decision:** Both UP and LEFT are good. UP keeps me in a central column, which may offer more options. LEFT moves me closer to the left side, which could limit space later. However, the board is 10x10, so not a big concern yet. I'll choose UP because it's directly above and continues a vertical growth pattern, which might be easier to manage.\n\n**Final move:** UP\n\nUP",

Its safe moves are UP to (3,6), DOWN to (3,4), RIGHT to (4,5). It cannot move LEFT into its own body at (2,5). It is likely to target the nearby apple at (4,5). If it moves RIGHT, it will eat that apple this turn.\n\n**Risk of head-on collision:** My head is at (5,6), enemy at (3,5). We are not adjacent, so no immediate collision this turn. However, if I move LEFT to (4,6) and enemy moves RIGHT to (4,5), we would be adjacent diagonally, not colliding. Safe.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- Apple (4,5) is contested. The enemy can reach it this turn by moving RIGHT. If I want it, I would need to move DOWN from my current position, which is unsafe. Therefore, I cannot claim (4,5) this turn. The enemy will likely take it.\n- My priority should be to secure other apples while avoiding future traps. After the enemy eats (4,5), it will grow to length 3, and its body will occupy (3,5) and (2,5). Its new head will be at (4,5).\n- The apples at (8,6) and (9,6) are on the right side and currently uncontested. Moving RIGHT now positions me to go for them.\n- Moving UP also gives good mobility and keeps me central, but doesn't directly target an immediate apple.\n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**\n- **UP to (5,7)**: From there, next moves: UP to (5,8) empty, LEFT to (4,7) empty, RIGHT to (6,7) empty. Good mobility, heading toward upper apples.\n- **LEFT to (4,6)**: Next moves: UP to (4,7) empty, DOWN to (4,5) \u2014 but (4,5) will likely be occupied by the enemy's head after this turn, making DOWN unsafe next turn. LEFT to (3,6) empty, RIGHT to (5,6) \u2014 but that's my current head position, which will be empty? Actually, after I move, my old head at (5,6) becomes a body segment. So moving RIGHT back to (5,6) would be into my own body next turn, so unsafe. So from (4,6), DOWN and RIGHT may be blocked soon.\n- **RIGHT to (6,6)**: Next moves: UP to (6,7) empty, DOWN to (6,5) empty, RIGHT to (7,6) empty. All open, and puts me on a path toward (8,6).\n\nGiven the enemy is likely to claim (4,5), moving LEFT seems less advantageous because it brings me near the enemy and may limit my next moves. Moving RIGHT secures a path to uncontested apples. UP is also safe but doesn't directly target an apple as quickly.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:** After this move, aim for the apple at (8,6) by moving RIGHT, then UP/right as needed. Keep an eye on the enemy's position to avoid head-on collisions. Maintain space to maneuver.\n\n**Final move:** RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

To reach (4, 5) in one turn, they would need to move diagonally or wrap, which is not allowed. Their legal moves are UP (5, 7), LEFT (4, 6), or RIGHT (6, 6). None of these intersect with (4, 5). Therefore, the apple is uncontested this turn.\n*   **Future Positioning:** After eating, my head will be at (4, 5). My body will be at (3, 5). This places me adjacent to the enemy's body at (5, 5) but allows me to pivot towards the top-right cluster of apples in subsequent turns (e.g., moving to (4, 6) if the enemy vacates).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **RIGHT** is the optimal play. It guarantees an apple, improves my score, and maintains a safe distance from the enemy head.\n\nStrategy Note: Collect the apple at (4, 5). Next turn, observe the enemy's move from (5, 6); prioritize moving UP to (4, 6) to press towards the apple cluster, or DOWN to (4, 4) to maintain space if the enemy blocks the path.\n\nRIGHT",

UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Apple positions:** (9,6), (8,8), (7,9), (8,6), (7,7)\n- **UP** to (6,7): Moves toward apples (7,7) and (8,8)/(7,9) cluster.\n- **DOWN** to (6,5): Moves away from most apples, only apple (8,6) is somewhat reachable but farther.\n- **RIGHT** to (7,6): Moves directly toward apples (8,6) and (9,6) on the right.\n\n**Enemy snake (#1):** Head at (4,5), body at [(3,5), (2,5)]. It just ate an apple last turn (since its apples increased to 2, and it was at (3,5) with body (2,5); moving RIGHT to (4,5) would have eaten the apple at (4,5)). So its current head is at (4,5), and it just grew. Its body now includes the old head (3,5) and tail (2,5), and it will have a new tail segment next turn? Actually, when you eat an apple, you grow over the next few moves by not moving your tail. So its length is now 3, but the tail hasn't moved yet. The board shows its body as [(3,5), (2,5)], but after growth, the tail is still at (2,5) and a new segment will appear behind the tail next turn? The representation might not show the growth until the tail stays. For safety, I'll assume its body occupies (4,5) head, (3,5), (2,5).\n\nEnemy's possible moves from (4,5):\n- UP to (4,6): Empty.\n- DOWN to (4,4): Empty.\n- LEFT to (3,5): Its own body (since it just grew, (3,5) is its neck) \u2192 **UNSAFE**.\n- RIGHT to (5,5): Empty.\n\nSo enemy can move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n**Risk of head-on collision:** My head at (6,6) is not adjacent to enemy head at (4,5). However, if I move RIGHT to (7,6) and enemy moves RIGHT to (5,5), we are not colliding. If I move UP to (6,7) and enemy moves UP to (4,6), no collision. If I move DOWN to (6,5) and enemy moves DOWN to (4,4), no collision. No immediate head-on risk this turn.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- Apple (7,7) is close and reachable in two moves: UP then RIGHT, or RIGHT then UP.\n- Apple (8,6) is also close: RIGHT then RIGHT.\n- Enemy is on the left side and may target apples (7,7) or (8,6) as well, but it's farther.\n- Moving DOWN to (6,5) seems suboptimal as it moves away from the apple cluster.\n- Moving RIGHT positions me well for (8,6) and keeps (7,7) accessible via UP next turn.\n- Moving UP positions me for (7,7) directly (next move RIGHT) and also toward the upper apples.\n\n**Future mobility after each safe move:**\n- **UP to (6,7)**: Next moves: UP to (6,8) empty, LEFT to (5,7) empty, RIGHT to (7,7) contains apple. Good mobility, and moving RIGHT next would eat apple (7,7).\n- **DOWN to (6,5)**: Next moves: DOWN to (6,4) empty, LEFT to (5,5) my own body (will be there? my tail is at (5,5) currently, but if I move, my tail may stay or move depending on growth? I have 2 apples, so my length is 3. My body is head (6,6), neck (5,6), tail (5,5). If I move, my neck moves to old head (6,6), tail moves to old neck (5,6)? Actually, when not growing, the tail moves forward. So after I move, my body will be: new head at move, then (6,6), then (5,6). So (5,5) becomes empty. So from (6,5), LEFT to (5,5) would be empty. But DOWN to (6,4) empty, RIGHT to (7,5) empty. Mobility okay but far from apples.\n- **RIGHT to (7,6)**: Next moves: UP to (7,7) apple, DOWN to (7,5) empty, RIGHT to (8,6) apple. Excellent mobility with two apples adjacent next turn.\n\nRIGHT seems strongest because it gives two apple-adjacent options next turn. UP also gives one apple-adjacent option. I should also consider that enemy might move UP to (4,6) and then RIGHT to (5,6) etc., potentially competing for apples.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:** Secure the nearest apples (7,7) and (8,6). After moving RIGHT to (7,6), assess next turn: if enemy is not threatening, choose UP to (7,7) to eat that apple, or RIGHT to (8,6) if that seems safer. Keep an eye on enemy's path to avoid head-on collisions.\n\n**Final move:** RIGHT",

However, if I move RIGHT to (8,6) and enemy moves RIGHT to (5,6), we are not colliding. If I move UP to (7,7) and enemy moves UP to (4,7), no collision.\n\n**Strategic evaluation:**  \nEating an apple is beneficial for score and growth, but growth changes future mobility because the tail doesn\u2019t move the turn after eating. That means next turn my body will be longer, occupying more cells, which could slightly reduce safe moves later. However, the primary goal is to collect apples safely.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT eat an apple. Which is better?\n\n- **UP to (7,7)**: After eating, my new head is at (7,7), body becomes [(7,6), (6,6), (5,6)] (tail stays at (5,6) because of growth). Next turn from (7,7), possible moves: UP to (7,8) empty, DOWN to (7,6) my own body (unsafe), LEFT to (6,7) empty, RIGHT to (8,7) empty. So three safe moves, and I\u2019m closer to the apple cluster at (8,8)/(7,9).\n\n- **RIGHT to (8,6)**: After eating, new head at (8,6), body becomes [(7,6), (6,6), (5,6)]. Next turn from (8,6), possible moves: UP to (8,7) empty, DOWN to (8,5) empty, LEFT to (7,6) my own body (unsafe), RIGHT to (9,6) apple. So three safe moves, and moving RIGHT next would eat another apple at (9,6).\n\nBoth give good future options. However, moving RIGHT puts me at (8,6), which is closer to the board edge (x=9). That could limit future mobility if I later need to turn. Moving UP to (7,7) is more central.\n\nAlso consider enemy\u2019s potential path: enemy might move UP toward (4,7) and then toward the upper apples, but it\u2019s far. It might also move RIGHT toward (5,6), heading toward my area. If I move RIGHT, I stay on the same y=6 row as enemy, possibly increasing future collision risk if it continues rightward. Moving UP changes my y, creating more distance.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter eating an apple, prioritize keeping safe space. If I move UP, next turn consider moving UP toward (7,8) to approach (8,8) apple, or LEFT to (6,7) to stay central. Avoid moving into corners. Monitor enemy\u2019s position; if it moves rightward, be cautious of head-on paths.\n\nGiven the above, **UP** seems slightly better because it moves away from the enemy\u2019s row and keeps me more central, with good access to multiple apples.\n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

That gives three safe moves and immediate access to two apples next turn. It also keeps me more central and away from enemy.\n\nRIGHT to (8,7) similarly gives future access to (8,8) and (9,6), but from (8,7) next turn: UP to (8,8) apple, DOWN to (8,6) apple, LEFT to (7,7) my body (unsafe), RIGHT to (9,7) empty.

Monitor enemy\u2019s position; if it moves rightward toward (5,7), be cautious of moving left into potential head-on path.

From (8,7) next turn, I could go DOWN to (8,6) to eat apple, or RIGHT to (9,7) toward (9,6). Good options.\n- **RIGHT** to (9,8) moves toward right edge, farther from most apples except (9,6) is down-left from there. From (9,8) next turn, only LEFT, DOWN, UP are possible (RIGHT off-board).

Also somewhat restrictive.\n\nDOWN seems best: it progresses toward the apple cluster, keeps three safe moves next turn (from (8,7): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT? Let\u2019s check: UP to (8,8) my body? Wait, my body after moving will be [(7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6)] with tail at (6,6). So from (8,7), UP to (8,8) is empty (since my head moved from (8,8) to (8,7) and my neck is at (7,8)). Actually, after moving DOWN, my new body is [(7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6)]? No, after moving, the new head is (8,7), and the old head (8,8) becomes the new neck? Let's recalc: current body: head (8,8), then (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6). If I move DOWN to (8,7), new head (8,7), then previous head (8,8) becomes first body segment, then (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), and tail (6,6) stays. So new body: [(8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6)]. So from (8,7), possible moves:\n- UP to (8,8): contains my body (neck) \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN to (8,6): contains apple, safe (eating is safe).\n- LEFT to (7,7): contains my body \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (9,7): empty, safe.\n\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe next turn from (8,7). That\u2019s only two options. That\u2019s restrictive.\n\nCheck **RIGHT** move: if I move RIGHT to (9,8), new body: [(8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6)]. From (9,8):\n- UP to (9,9): empty, safe.\n- DOWN to (9,7): empty, safe.\n- LEFT to (8,8): my body (neck) \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT to (10,8) off-board \u2192 unsafe.\nSo two safe moves (UP, DOWN). Also restrictive.\n\nCheck **UP** move: if I move UP to (8,9), new body: [(8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6)]. From (8,9):\n- UP to (8,10) off-board \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN to (8,8): my body \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (7,9): contains apple, safe.\n- RIGHT to (9,9): empty, safe.\nSo two safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT).\n\nAll safe moves lead to only two safe follow-ups because my body blocks adjacent cells. That\u2019s typical after growing longer.

Apple at (7,9) is close next turn.\n\nBoth DOWN and UP offer an apple reachable in one more move. DOWN\u2019s apple (8,6) is closer to other apples (9,6, 6,7) for future pathing. UP\u2019s apple (7,9) is more isolated.\n\nAlso, enemy at (5,8) might move RIGHT to (6,8), which is closer to my area if I go UP/LEFT. DOWN keeps me farther.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter moving DOWN to (8,7), next turn prioritize moving DOWN to (8,6) to eat apple, unless that becomes unsafe (e.g., enemy blocks). If DOWN is unsafe, move RIGHT to (9,7) to open space and approach (9,6). Monitor enemy movement; avoid moving left into potential head-on collision if enemy advances rightward.\n\nGiven the above, **DOWN** is best because it positions me to eat apple (8,6) next turn while staying away from enemy and keeping a path toward other apples.\n\n**Final move:**  \nDOWN",

Its possible safe moves (checking board and its body):  \n- UP to (5,8): Its own body (neck) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN to (5,6): Empty.  \n- LEFT to (4,7): Empty.  \n- RIGHT to (6,7): Contains apple (6,7). Eating is safe.  \n\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (6,7), it eats apple (6,7) and grows. That position is two steps left of my head. No immediate collision risk this turn.\n\n**Strategic evaluation:**  \nDOWN is highly attractive: immediate apple, increases my lead. After eating, my new tail will remain at (6,6) (since growth means tail doesn\u2019t move this turn). My new body will be: head (8,6), then (8,7), (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6) \u2014 length 7.\n\nFrom (8,6) next turn, I need to check safety but will have just eaten, so tail stays, opening more space behind. RIGHT move offers no immediate reward and leaves apple (8,6) for enemy possibly later.\n\n**Potential trap consideration:** After moving DOWN to (8,6), my head is at board edge? No, y=6 is fine. From (8,6) next turn, possible moves: UP (back to (8,7) which will be my neck), DOWN to (8,5), LEFT to (7,6) (my body), RIGHT to (9,6) (apple). So likely safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT. That\u2019s acceptable given the apple gain.\n\nRIGHT move to (9,7) leaves apple (8,6) uneaten, potentially letting enemy get it if they move right then down. Also from (9,7) next turn, safe moves might be limited (UP to (9,8) empty? Actually (9,8) is empty, DOWN to (9,6) apple, LEFT to (8,7) my neck? Wait, after moving RIGHT, my body: head (9,7), neck (8,7), then (8,8), (7,8), (7,7), (7,6), (6,6). So from (9,7), LEFT to (8,7) is my neck \u2192 unsafe. So only UP and DOWN would be safe. That\u2019s more restrictive.\n\nThus **DOWN** is superior: immediate apple, better future options.\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (8,6), my head at (8,6). Next turn prioritize moving RIGHT to (9,6) to eat that apple if safe (check enemy positions). If RIGHT is unsafe (e.g., enemy might move to (9,6)?), consider DOWN to (8,5) to open space. Monitor enemy movement; they may be aiming for apple (6,7) or (9,6). Keep building apple lead while avoiding head-on collisions.\n\nDOWN",

It will likely go DOWN to eat the apple at (5,4), which is only 1 step away. That move does not create an immediate head-on collision with me, as I'm at (8,5) moving to (8,4) or (7,5).\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate future mobility and strategic direction:**\n- **DOWN to (8,4):** From there, next turn safe moves would likely be DOWN to (8,3), LEFT to (7,4), RIGHT to (9,4)? Wait, check: my body after moving DOWN (assuming no apple) would be [(8,4), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8)] with tail at (7,8).

However, this moves me away from the cluster of apples at (7,9), (3,9), (2,3), (2,2). The closest apple from (8,4) is (5,4) but enemy is about to eat it.\n\n- **LEFT to (7,5):** From there, next turn safe moves: my new body would be [(7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8)] with tail at (7,8). From (7,5):\n    - UP to (7,6): empty? Check board: (7,6) is empty in current state, and after my move it's still empty.\n    - DOWN to (7,4): empty.\n    - LEFT to (6,5): empty.\n    - RIGHT to (8,5): my body (neck) \u2192 unsafe.\nSo three safe moves next turn as well. This move positions me closer to the apple at (7,9) (two steps up and right) and the central area. It also keeps me closer to the other apples on the left side (2,3), (2,2) in the long run.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan note:**\nLEFT seems better because it moves toward the apple-rich top-left quadrant and away from the right edge where my body is coiled. After moving LEFT to (7,5), next turn I can consider UP to (7,6) to approach apple (7,9) or LEFT/DOWN to continue toward other apples.

Enemy snake #1's head is at (5,4) with body [(5,5), (5,6), (6,6), (6,7)].\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (7,5):**\n- **UP** to (7,6): Currently empty. **SAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (7,4): Empty. **SAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (6,5): Empty. **SAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (8,5): Contains my own body (neck). **UNSAFE**.\n\nAll except RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Step 2: Check for immediate apple consumption:**\n- UP to (7,6): No apple.\n- DOWN to (7,4): No apple.\n- LEFT to (6,5): No apple.\nNone gives an apple this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Consider enemy #1's possible moves from (5,4):**\nEnemy's safe moves (avoiding its body and board edges):\n- UP to (5,5): Its own body \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN to (5,3): Empty.\n- LEFT to (4,4): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (6,4): Empty.\nEnemy has three safe moves. The apple at (5,0) is far, but the apple at (2,3) and (2,2) are closer to the left side. Enemy might move LEFT/DOWN to approach them. A head-on collision risk? My possible moves are (7,6), (7,4), (6,5). Enemy's possible moves are (5,3), (4,4), (6,4). No overlap this turn.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate future mobility and strategic direction:**\n- **UP to (7,6):** Moves toward apple at (7,9) (three steps up). From (7,6), next turn safe moves would be UP to (7,7), LEFT to (6,6), RIGHT to (8,6)? Check: After moving UP, my body becomes [(7,6), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8)] with tail at (7,8). So (7,7) empty, (6,6) empty, (8,6) is my body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN to (7,5) is neck \u2192 unsafe. So only UP and LEFT are safe next turn. That's restrictive.\n- **DOWN to (7,4):** Moves toward apple at (5,0) (four steps down-left). From (7,4), body: [(7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8)]. Next turn: UP to (7,5) neck \u2192 unsafe, DOWN to (7,3) empty, LEFT to (6,4) empty, RIGHT to (8,4) empty. Three safe moves. Good mobility.\n- **LEFT to (6,5):** Moves toward center and apples on left. From (6,5), body: [(6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8)]. Next turn: UP to (6,6) empty, DOWN to (6,4) empty, LEFT to (5,5) contains enemy body? Currently (5,5) is enemy body, but enemy will move this turn. If enemy moves away, (5,5) could become empty. However, it's risky to assume. RIGHT to (7,5) neck \u2192 unsafe. So likely two safe moves (UP, DOWN) if (5,5) remains occupied, maybe three if enemy vacates.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan:**\nI have 6 apples, enemy has 4. I want to maintain lead and avoid risky traps. UP seems to lead to a potential dead-end near the top wall with limited moves. DOWN offers good mobility and approaches the apple at (5,0) while keeping distance from enemy. LEFT is okay but may bring me closer to enemy's possible path toward apples (2,3) and (2,2). Since enemy is at (5,4), moving DOWN to (7,4) keeps me south and may allow me to circle toward the bottom-left apples later.\n\nGiven my body is coiled on the right side, moving DOWN opens more space and keeps multiple options. I'll choose DOWN.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (7,4), consider moving toward (5,0) via DOWN/LEFT, while monitoring enemy's position. Avoid getting trapped against the left wall.\n\nDOWN",

No overlap this turn, so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate future mobility and strategic direction:**\n- **DOWN to (7,3):** Moves toward apple at (5,0). From (7,3), body: [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,7)]. Next turn: UP to (7,4) neck \u2192 unsafe, DOWN to (7,2) empty, LEFT to (6,3) empty, RIGHT to (8,3) empty. Three safe moves. Good mobility and continues the path toward the bottom-left apple.\n- **LEFT to (6,4):** Moves toward center. From (6,4), body: [(6,4), (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,7)]. Next turn: UP to (6,5) empty, DOWN to (6,3) empty, LEFT to (5,4) contains enemy body? Currently (5,4) is enemy body, but enemy will move. It's risky to assume it becomes empty. RIGHT to (7,4) neck \u2192 unsafe. So likely two safe moves (UP, DOWN) unless enemy vacates (5,4). This direction also moves me closer to the enemy's potential path toward the left-side apples, increasing future collision risk.\n- **RIGHT to (8,4):** Moves toward the right wall. From (8,4), body: [(8,4), (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6), (8,7)]. Next turn: UP to (8,5) my body \u2192 unsafe, DOWN to (8,3) empty, LEFT to (7,4) neck \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT to (9,4) empty. Only two safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT). This is restrictive and pushes me toward the right edge where my body is coiled, potentially trapping me.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and apple targeting:**\nI have a lead (6 apples vs 4). My priority is to maintain safety while progressing toward an apple. The closest apple is (5,0) \u2013 4 moves away via DOWN and LEFT. The apples at (2,3) and (2,2) are also options but are closer to the enemy. Moving DOWN to (7,3) is a direct step toward (5,0) and maintains high mobility. Moving LEFT brings me closer to the enemy's probable path. Moving RIGHT reduces options.\n\nGiven the enemy's position, it is likely to move toward the left-side apples. I should avoid converging into its path. Moving DOWN keeps me south and allows me to potentially loop around the bottom to collect (5,0) while the enemy is occupied on the left. This seems the safest strategic choice.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (7,3), aim to move DOWN/LEFT toward (5,0). Monitor enemy's movement; if it moves toward (2,3)/(2,2), I can safely collect the bottom apple. If it moves south, I may need to adjust to avoid a future collision. Keep mobility high.\n\nDOWN",

From (7,2), body: [(7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6)]. Next turn: UP to (7,3) neck \u2192 unsafe, DOWN to (7,1) empty, LEFT to (6,2) empty, RIGHT to (8,2) empty. Three safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Good mobility and continues the path toward the bottom-left apple.\n- **LEFT to (6,3):** Moves toward center. From (6,3), body: [(6,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6)]. Next turn: UP to (6,4) empty, DOWN to (6,2) empty, LEFT to (5,3) contains enemy body? Currently (5,3) is enemy body, but enemy will move. It's risky to assume it becomes empty. RIGHT to (7,3) neck \u2192 unsafe. So likely two safe moves (UP, DOWN) unless enemy vacates (5,3). This direction moves me closer to the enemy's potential path toward the left-side apples.\n- **RIGHT to (8,3):** Moves toward the right wall. From (8,3), body: [(8,3), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6), (8,6)]. Next turn: UP to (8,4) empty, DOWN to (8,2) empty, LEFT to (7,3) neck \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT to (9,3) empty. Three safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). This is better than I thought earlier, but still moves me away from the apples.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and apple targeting:**\nI have a lead (6 apples vs 4). My priority is to maintain safety while progressing toward an apple. The closest apple is (5,0) \u2013 3 moves away via DOWN and LEFT. The apples at (2,3) and (2,2) are also options but are closer to the enemy. Moving DOWN to (7,2) is a direct step toward (5,0) and maintains high mobility. Moving LEFT brings me closer to the enemy's probable path. Moving RIGHT moves me away from the apples.\n\nGiven the enemy's position, it is likely to move toward the left-side apples. I should avoid converging into its path. Moving DOWN keeps me south and allows me to potentially loop around the bottom to collect (5,0) while the enemy is occupied on the left. This seems the safest strategic choice.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (7,2), aim to move DOWN/LEFT toward (5,0). Monitor enemy's movement; if it moves toward (2,3)/(2,2), I can safely collect the bottom apple. If it moves south, I may need to adjust to avoid a future collision. Keep mobility high.\n\nDOWN",

Enemy snake #1's head is at (5,1) with body [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)].\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (7,2):**\n- **UP** to (7,3): Contains my own body (neck). **UNSAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (7,1): Empty. **SAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (6,2): Empty. **SAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (8,2): Empty. **SAFE**.\n\nAll except UP are safe.\n\n**Step 2: Check for immediate apple consumption:**\n- DOWN to (7,1): No apple.\n- LEFT to (6,2): No apple.\n- RIGHT to (8,2): No apple.\nNone gives an apple this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Consider enemy #1's possible moves from (5,1):**\nEnemy's safe moves (avoiding its body and board edges):\n- UP to (5,2): Its own body \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN to (5,0): Contains apple at (5,0). This is safe and would let it eat.\n- LEFT to (4,1): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (6,1): Empty.\nEnemy has three safe moves, with a strong incentive to go DOWN to eat the apple at (5,0). My possible safe moves are (7,1), (6,2), (8,2). Enemy's possible moves are (5,0), (4,1), (6,1). No overlap this turn, so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate future mobility and strategic direction:**\n- **DOWN to (7,1):** Moves toward the bottom row. From (7,1), body: [(7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6)]. Next turn: UP to (7,2) neck \u2192 unsafe, DOWN to (7,0) empty, LEFT to (6,1) (possible enemy move target), RIGHT to (8,1) empty. Two safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT) if enemy goes to (6,1). Mobility is moderate but risks being near enemy path.\n- **LEFT to (6,2):** Moves toward center. From (6,2), body: [(6,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6)]. Next turn: UP to (6,3) empty, DOWN to (6,1) (possible enemy move target), LEFT to (5,2) enemy body (but enemy may move), RIGHT to (7,2) neck \u2192 unsafe. So likely two safe moves (UP, LEFT) if enemy vacates (5,2). This direction moves me closer to the enemy's potential path.\n- **RIGHT to (8,2):** Moves toward the right wall. From (8,2), body: [(8,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), (9,6)]. Next turn: UP to (8,3) empty, DOWN to (8,1) empty, LEFT to (7,2) neck \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT to (9,2) empty. Three safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). This offers the best immediate future mobility and keeps me away from the enemy's likely path toward the bottom-left apple.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and apple targeting:**\nI have a lead (6 apples vs 4). The enemy is likely to eat the apple at (5,0) this turn, tying the score at 5-5. My priority is to maintain safety and position for the next apple. The apples at (2,3) and (2,2) are on the left, but moving left brings me into the enemy's zone after it eats. The apple at (7,9) is far north. Moving RIGHT to (8,2) gives me excellent mobility and opens a path to potentially loop up the right side toward the top apples (7,9) or (3,9) while staying clear of the enemy. This seems the safest strategic choice to preserve my lead and avoid conflict.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (8,2), aim to move UP/RIGHT to explore the top-right quadrant and target the apple at (7,9) or (3,9). Monitor enemy's movement; if it moves toward the left-side apples, I can safely collect a top apple. Keep mobility high and avoid boxing myself in.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy's possible moves are (4,0) and (6,0). No overlap this turn, so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate future mobility and strategic direction:**\n- **UP to (8,3):** Moves toward top apples.

Moving UP to (8,3) is a step in that direction, and while it reduces immediate mobility to two safe moves, both are viable (UP continues north, RIGHT moves along the top edge). I need to navigate around my own body which currently blocks leftward movement from that position. The body forms a vertical wall from (7,2) to (7,5) and a horizontal segment at (8,5)-(9,5). Moving UP then potentially RIGHT and UP can loop around.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (8,3), aim to go UP to (8,4), then likely RIGHT to (9,4) to avoid my body, then UP toward (9,5) is my tail, which will move as I progress.

Enemy snake #1's head is at (4,0) with body [(5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4)].\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (8,3):**\n- **UP** to (8,4): Empty. **SAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (8,2): Contains my own body (neck). **UNSAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (7,3): Contains my own body. **UNSAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (9,3): Empty. **SAFE**.\n\nOnly UP and RIGHT are safe moves.\n\n**Step 2: Check for immediate apple consumption:**\n- UP to (8,4): No apple.\n- RIGHT to (9,3): No apple.\nNeither gives an apple this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Consider enemy #1's possible moves from (4,0):**\nEnemy's safe moves (avoiding its body and board edges):\n- UP to (4,1): Empty.\n- DOWN: Off board (y=-1) \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (3,0): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (5,0): Its own body \u2192 unsafe.\nEnemy has two safe moves: UP to (4,1) and LEFT to (3,0). It will likely move toward the cluster of apples at (2,3), (2,2), (1,1). Moving LEFT gets it closer horizontally, but UP also moves it closer vertically. My safe moves are (8,4) and (9,3). Enemy's possible moves are (4,1) and (3,0). No overlap this turn, so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate future mobility and strategic direction:**\n- **UP to (8,4):** Moves toward top apples (7,9) and (3,9). From (8,4), body: [(8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,5)]. Next turn: UP to (8,5) is my tail \u2192 safe (tail will move as I didn't eat an apple), DOWN to (8,3) neck \u2192 unsafe, LEFT to (7,4) my body \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT to (9,4) empty. Two safe moves (UP, RIGHT). This continues the path toward the top apples.\n- **RIGHT to (9,3):** Moves to the right edge. From (9,3), body: [(9,3), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,5)]. Next turn: UP to (9,4) empty, DOWN to (9,2) empty, LEFT to (8,3) neck \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT off board \u2192 unsafe. Two safe moves (UP, DOWN). This boxes me against the wall and reduces long-term options.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and apple targeting:**\nI have a lead (6 apples vs 5). The enemy is moving toward the bottom-left apple cluster. My best opportunity is to target the top apples, especially (7,9), which is closer. Moving UP to (8,4) is a direct step north. While it reduces immediate mobility to two safe moves next turn, both are viable: UP into my tail (which will vacate as I move) or RIGHT along the top edge. I need to navigate around my own body, which currently blocks leftward movement. The plan is to continue UP, then possibly RIGHT, then UP again to approach (7,9). My tail at (8,5) will move forward as I progress, opening up space.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (8,4), if UP to (8,5) is safe (tail), take it. Then from (8,5), consider RIGHT to (9,5) or UP to (8,6) to continue toward (7,9). Monitor enemy movement; it's likely heading left/up, giving me time to collect a top apple safely. Avoid boxing myself against the right wall.\n\nUP",

Two safe moves (UP, LEFT). This reduces options and doesn't progress toward any apple as directly.\n- **RIGHT to (9,5):** Moves to the right edge. From (9,5), body: [(9,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)]. Next turn: UP to (9,6) empty, DOWN to (9,4) empty, LEFT to (8,5) neck \u2192 unsafe, RIGHT off board \u2192 unsafe. Two safe moves (UP, DOWN). This boxes me against the wall and reduces long-term options.\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan and apple targeting:**\nI have a lead (6 apples vs 5). The enemy is moving toward the bottom-left apple cluster. My best opportunity is to target the top apples, especially (7,9), which is closer. Moving UP to (8,6) is a direct step north and maintains good mobility with three safe moves next turn. My tail at (7,4) will move forward as I progress, opening up space. Moving LEFT or RIGHT reduces mobility and doesn't progress toward an apple as effectively.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (8,6), I can consider UP to (8,7) to continue toward (7,9), or LEFT to (7,6) to approach from the west, or RIGHT to (9,6) to explore the top-right. Monitor enemy movement; it's likely heading left/up, giving me time to collect a top apple safely. Avoid boxing myself against the right wall.\n\nUP",

Enemy snake #1's head is at (2,3) with body [(2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (5,1)].\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (7,7):**\n- **UP** to (7,8): Empty. **SAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (7,6): Empty. **SAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (6,7): Empty. **SAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (8,7): Contains my own body (neck at (8,7)). **UNSAFE**.\n\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. RIGHT is unsafe into my neck.\n\n**Step 2: Check for immediate apple consumption:**\n- UP to (7,8): No apple.\n- DOWN to (7,6): No apple.\n- LEFT to (6,7): No apple.\nNone of the safe moves directly eat an apple this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Consider enemy #1's possible moves from (2,3):**\nEnemy's safe moves (avoiding its body and board edges):\n- UP to (2,4): Empty.\n- DOWN to (2,2): Its own body \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (1,3): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (3,3): Empty.\nEnemy has three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. The apple at (3,9) is far, but (1,1) is closer. Enemy might move UP to head toward top apples or LEFT/DOWN toward (1,1). No immediate head-on collision risk with my possible moves.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate future mobility and strategic direction:**\n- **UP to (7,8):** Moves toward apple at (7,9). Body becomes [(7,8), (7,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2), (7,2)]. Next turn from (7,8): UP to (7,9) has apple, DOWN to (7,7) neck \u2192 unsafe, LEFT to (6,8) empty, RIGHT to (8,8) empty. Three safe moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT). Excellent.\n- **DOWN to (7,6):** Moves away from top apples. Body becomes [(7,6), (7,7), (8,7), ...]. Next turn from (7,6): UP to (7,7) neck \u2192 unsafe, DOWN to (7,5) empty, LEFT to (6,6) empty, RIGHT to (8,6) my body \u2192 unsafe. Two safe moves (DOWN, LEFT). Reduces mobility and moves into more crowded area with my own body.\n- **LEFT to (6,7):** Moves laterally. Body becomes [(6,7), (7,7), (8,7), ...]. Next turn from (6,7): UP to (6,8) empty, DOWN to (6,6) empty, LEFT to (5,7) empty, RIGHT to (7,7) neck \u2192 unsafe. Three safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Good mobility, but not directly toward an apple.\n\n**Step 5: Decision and long-term plan:**\nUP is the best move. It directly progresses toward the apple at (7,9), which I can eat next turn if I move UP again. This will give me an 8-7 lead. My mobility remains high with three safe follow-ups. Moving DOWN is inferior due to reduced mobility and moving away from apples. LEFT is safe but doesn't advance toward an immediate apple.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After moving UP to (7,8), next turn move UP to (7,9) to eat that apple, assuming it's still there and safe. Be aware that enemy might be heading toward (3,9) as well, but I'm closer to (7,9). After eating, consider moving toward (3,9) or (9,1) depending on enemy positions. Avoid getting trapped on edges.\n\nUP",

This move significantly improves the position: it brings the snake closer to the apple at (0, 4) (distance becomes 2) and sets up a path towards the top apples at (3, 9) and (7, 9). Crucially, it maintains the formation where the body trails behind the head, minimizing the risk of trapping oneself.\n*   **DOWN:** **FATAL.** The cell (2, 2) is occupied by the snake's own body segment. Moving backwards guarantees a collision with self.\n*   **LEFT:** **Safe but Cornering.** Moving to (1, 3) is safe and targets the apple at (1, 1). While (1, 1) is close, reaching it requires moving into the bottom-left corner, which is a constrained space. It moves the snake away from the cluster of apples at the top of the board.\n*   **RIGHT:** **Safe but Suboptimal.** Moving to (3, 3) is safe. However, it moves the snake horizontally towards the enemy snake (located near x=7) and does not bring it closer to the nearest apple (0, 4) as efficiently as moving UP.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove **UP** to capture the apple at (0, 4) and secure a strong position on the upper half of the board.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nAfter securing the apple at (0, 4), continue moving UP or navigate towards (3, 9) to contest the top apples. Keep an eye on Snake #0, who is currently near (7, 7), to avoid head-on collisions.\n\nUP",

Enemy snake #1's head is at (2,4) with body [(2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0), (5,0)].\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (7,8):**\n- **UP** to (7,9): Contains an apple. **SAFE** (eating apple is safe unless collision).\n- **DOWN** to (7,7): Contains my own body (neck at (7,7)). **UNSAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (6,8): Empty. **SAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (8,8): Empty. **SAFE**.\n\nThree safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. DOWN is unsafe into my neck.\n\n**Step 2: Check for immediate apple consumption:**\n- UP to (7,9): Yes, apple at (7,9). This would give me 8 apples, taking the lead.\n- LEFT to (6,8): No apple.\n- RIGHT to (8,8): No apple.\nUP directly eats an apple.\n\n**Step 3: Consider enemy #1's possible moves from (2,4):**\nEnemy's safe moves (avoiding its body and board edges):\n- UP to (2,5): Empty.\n- DOWN to (2,3): Its own body \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (1,4): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (3,4): Empty.\nEnemy has three safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. The apple at (3,9) is far, but (1,1) and (0,4) are closer. Enemy might move UP toward top apples or LEFT toward (1,1) or (0,4). No immediate head-on collision risk with my possible moves, as I'm far away.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate safety of eating the apple at (7,9):**\nMoving UP to (7,9) is safe from self-collision and board edges. Need to consider if enemy could also move into (7,9) this turn? Enemy is at (2,4), too far. No other snakes. So no head-on collision risk. Eating the apple is safe and gives me the lead.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate future mobility after eating:**\nIf I eat the apple at (7,9), my new head will be at (7,9), and I will grow by 1 segment. My body will become: head (7,9), then the current head (7,8) becomes new segment 2, followed by the rest of the body. The tail will not move this turn because I'm growing. So next turn my body will be: [(7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)] (length 9). From (7,9) next turn:\n- UP: off board (y=10) \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN to (7,8): my own new body segment \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (6,9): empty.\n- RIGHT to (8,9): empty.\nOnly two safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT. That's a reduction in mobility, but I'll be at the top edge. I'll need to plan an exit from the top edge next turn.\n\nAlternative moves LEFT or RIGHT keep me alive but don't eat the apple, letting enemy potentially catch up. However, they offer better immediate future mobility. But eating the apple gives me a lead and is the primary objective.\n\n**Step 6: Decision and long-term plan:**\nUP is the best move because it secures an apple and gives me an 8-7 lead. Although next turn my mobility at the top edge will be limited (only LEFT or RIGHT), I can then move along the top row toward other apples (e.g., (3,9) to the left or (9,1) eventually). I must be careful not to get trapped. Enemy is still at (2,4) and may be heading toward (3,9) as well, so I might want to move LEFT after eating to compete for (3,9). But first, secure the apple.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After moving UP to (7,9) and eating the apple, next turn I will have only LEFT and RIGHT as safe moves. I should assess which direction offers better access to remaining apples and avoids dead ends. Likely move LEFT toward (3,9) if it's still there, but check enemy position. If enemy is close to (3,9), maybe go RIGHT to eventually descend toward (9,1). Avoid moving into corners.\n\nUP",

Enemy snake #1 is at head (1,4) with body [(2,4), (2,3), (2,2), (2,1), (2,0), (3,0), (4,0)], and has 7 apples.\n\n**Step 1: Immediate safety check from (7,9):**\n- **UP** to (7,10): Off board (y=10) \u2192 **UNSAFE**.\n- **DOWN** to (7,8): Contains my own body (second segment) \u2192 **UNSAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (6,9): Empty. **SAFE**.\n- **RIGHT** to (8,9): Empty. **SAFE**.\n\nOnly two safe moves: LEFT and RIGHT. This matches my prediction from last turn.\n\n**Step 2: Check for immediate apple consumption:**\n- LEFT to (6,9): No apple.\n- RIGHT to (8,9): No apple.\nNeither directly eats an apple.\n\n**Step 3: Consider enemy #1's possible moves from (1,4):**\nEnemy's safe moves (avoiding its body and board edges):\n- UP to (1,5): Empty.\n- DOWN to (1,3): Empty.\n- LEFT to (0,4): Contains apple at (0,4). **SAFE** (eating apple is safe).\n- RIGHT to (2,4): Its own body \u2192 unsafe.\nEnemy has three safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. The apple at (0,4) is directly to its LEFT. Enemy is likely to move LEFT to eat that apple, bringing its apple count to 8, tying with me. If enemy moves LEFT, its new head will be at (0,4), and it will grow, extending its body.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate safety of my moves regarding potential head-on collisions:**\n- My LEFT to (6,9) is far from enemy's possible moves. No risk.\n- My RIGHT to (8,9) is also far. No risk.\nNo immediate head-on collision threat.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate future mobility and apple access:**\n- **LEFT to (6,9):** From there, next turn I could move UP (off board), DOWN (into my body at (6,8)? Actually my body after moving left: new head (6,9), then old head (7,9) becomes segment 2, followed by (7,8), (7,7), etc. So DOWN to (6,8) would be empty? Let's simulate: If I move LEFT, my new body becomes [(6,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (8,7), ...]. The cell (6,8) is not in that list. So DOWN would be safe. LEFT to (5,9) and RIGHT to (7,9) (which would be my body). So from (6,9), safe moves next turn would be DOWN, LEFT (if within board). That gives two moves. Moving LEFT also brings me closer to the apple at (3,9) along the top row.\n- **RIGHT to (8,9):** From there, next turn safe moves would be DOWN to (8,8) (empty) and RIGHT to (9,9) (empty). That also gives two moves. Moving RIGHT brings me toward the right edge and eventually down toward apple at (9,1), but that's far.\n\nApple at (3,9) is on the top row at y=9. Moving LEFT gets me closer to it. Enemy is at (1,4) and might also aim for (3,9) but would need to go UP then RIGHT. If enemy moves LEFT to (0,4) to eat that apple, it will grow and its head will be at (0,4). From there, to reach (3,9) it would need to go UP several times and RIGHT. I am closer to (3,9) if I move LEFT now.\n\nApple at (4,7) is also on the board. From my position, moving LEFT then eventually DOWN could target that. But (4,7) is closer to the enemy's current position? Enemy at (1,4) could go UP then RIGHT to (4,7) in a few moves.\n\n**Step 6: Decision and long-term plan:**\nI should move LEFT to (6,9) to pursue the apple at (3,9). This keeps me on the top edge but gives me a path along the top row. I need to be careful not to get trapped at the left edge. Since I have only two safe moves each turn while on the top row, I should plan to descend after securing the apple. Enemy is likely to eat the apple at (0,4) this turn, tying the score at 8-8. I need to stay ahead.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After moving LEFT to (6,9), next turn I will assess: if apple (3,9) is still there and the path is clear, continue LEFT toward it. If enemy is approaching (3,9), I might consider descending earlier to avoid a potential dead-end at the top-left corner. Also, keep an eye on apple (4,7) as a backup target.\n\nLEFT",

Moving LEFT to (5,9) gets me closer to it. Moving DOWN to (6,8) takes me away from it but opens up the central board.\n\n**Enemy Threat:** Snake #1's head is at (0,4). It has an apple directly to its LEFT at (0,4) (which it will likely eat this turn, tying the score at 8-8). It is far from me, so no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Future Mobility:**\n*   **LEFT to (5,9)**: Puts me on the top edge. Next turn, my safe moves would likely be DOWN and LEFT again (UP off board, RIGHT into my new body at (6,9)). This path leads directly to the apple at (3,9) but risks getting trapped along the top row.\n*   **DOWN to (6,8)**: Moves me off the top edge. From (6,8), I would have more options (likely LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT) next turn, improving my mobility and allowing me to target apples like (4,7) or eventually (1,1).\n\n**Strategic Decision:** While the apple at (3,9) is tempting, moving LEFT along the top row severely limits my future safe moves to just two per turn, increasing the risk of a dead-end. The [snake.wits.ai](https://snake.wits.ai/docs) documentation emphasizes the importance of avoiding getting trapped. Moving DOWN sacrifices immediate proximity to that apple but preserves much better mobility, which is crucial for long-term survival and apple collection. The [github.com](https://github.com/JeremyHub/Snake-Algorithms) project's AI also prioritizes keeping the tail in sight and avoiding voids.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move DOWN to improve mobility.

It is far away. Its possible moves:\n*   UP (0,4): Its own body \u2192 UNSAFE.\n*   DOWN (0,2): Empty \u2192 SAFE.\n*   LEFT (-1,3): Off board \u2192 UNSAFE.\n*   RIGHT (1,3): Empty \u2192 SAFE.\nIt will likely move DOWN (toward apple at (1,1)) or RIGHT (into open space). No immediate head-on collision risk with me.\n\n**Apple Targeting & Pathing:**\nApples at: (3,9), (1,1), (9,1), (4,7), (9,2).\n*   **Apple (4,7)** is closest to my current head (Manhattan distance 3: |6-4| + |8-7| = 2+1=3). Moving **DOWN** to (6,7) reduces that distance to 2 (|6-4| + |7-7| = 2+0=2). Moving **LEFT** to (5,8) keeps distance at 3 (|5-4| + |8-7| = 1+1=2? Wait recalc: |5-4|=1, |8-7|=1, total 2). Actually LEFT is also distance 2. Both moves get me equally closer in Manhattan terms.\n*   However, the path to (4,7) from (6,7) after moving DOWN seems more direct and less obstructed by my own body. From (5,8), my long body along the right side (column 8) might block a direct path south.\n*   **Apple (1,1)** is also valuable but farther. Enemy snake is heading that general direction.\n\n**Future Mobility & Trap Avoidance:**\n*   **LEFT to (5,8)**: Puts me near the top. Next turn, my safe moves would likely be DOWN and LEFT again (UP into my body at (6,8)? Actually UP (5,9) is my body? Wait, my body from last head (6,9) moved to (6,8)? Let's trace: My body is [(6,9), (7,9), (7,8), (7,7), (8,7), (8,6), (8,5), (8,4)]. So (5,9) is empty, (6,9) is my body. So from (5,8), UP (5,9) is safe? Yes, empty. But RIGHT (6,8) would be my new body position? After moving LEFT, my new head is (5,8), and my old head (6,8) becomes the new first body segment. So from (5,8), RIGHT (6,8) is my own body \u2192 UNSAFE. So safe moves from (5,8) would be UP, DOWN, LEFT. That's actually three options. However, moving UP continues along the top edge, which can be limiting.\n*   **DOWN to (6,7)**: Moves me more central. From (6,7), safe moves would likely be DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (UP into new body at (6,8)). That's three options as well, but in a more open area.\n\n**Strategic Decision & Plan for Next Turns:**\nThe [snake.wits.ai](https://snake.wits.ai/docs) docs and the [github.com](https://github.com/JeremyHub/Snake-Algorithms) AI principle emphasize maintaining mobility and avoiding dead-ends. While both moves are safe and get me closer to apple (4,7), moving **DOWN** feels slightly better because it keeps me away from the top edge and positions me to potentially loop around my own body to access the central apples. My long body along columns 7-8 on the right is a barrier, but moving down helps me stay on the \"open\" side of it.\n\n**Plan:** Move DOWN to (6,7). Next turn, reassess path to apple (4,7). If direct path is blocked by my body, consider a longer route (e.g., go LEFT then DOWN) or switch target to apple (1,1) or (9,1)/(9,2). Continue to monitor enemy #1's movement toward the bottom-left apples.\n\nDOWN",

It keeps the snake hugging the left wall, which is a safe strategy to avoid the crowded center and the enemy snake in the top right. It moves closer to the cluster of apples in the bottom left, specifically (1, 1).\n\n**Decision:**\nMove **DOWN** to maintain a safe path along the wall towards the nearby apples.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue hugging the left wall downwards. From (0, 2), proceed to (0, 1) and then turn RIGHT to (1, 1) to collect the apple. This keeps the body compact and maximizes open space on the board.\n\nDOWN",

Its possible moves:\n*   UP (0,3): Its own body \u2192 UNSAFE.\n*   DOWN (0,1): Empty \u2192 SAFE.\n*   LEFT (-1,2): Off board \u2192 UNSAFE.\n*   RIGHT (1,2): Empty \u2192 SAFE.\nIt will likely move DOWN (toward apple at (1,1)) or RIGHT. No immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Apple Targeting & Pathing:**\nApples at: (3,9), (1,1), (9,1), (4,7), (9,2).\n*   **Apple (4,7)** is adjacent to my current head! Manhattan distance is 2 (|6-4| + |7-7| = 2). Moving **LEFT** to (5,7) reduces that distance to 1 (|5-4| + |7-7| = 1). Moving **DOWN** to (6,6) increases the distance to 3 (|6-4| + |6-7| = 2+1=3).\n*   However, the direct path from (5,7) to (4,7) is a single move LEFT next turn. That move would be into a cell that is currently empty. This seems like the quickest route to an apple.\n*   Apple (1,1) is being contested by the enemy. Apples (9,1) and (9,2) are on the far right, behind my long body barrier.\n\n**Future Mobility & Trap Avoidance:**\n*   **LEFT to (5,7)**: Gets me next to the apple. From (5,7), my safe moves next turn would likely be UP, DOWN, LEFT (RIGHT into my new body at (6,7) would be unsafe). LEFT would take the apple. This seems highly efficient.\n*   **DOWN to (6,6)**: Moves me away from the closest apple. From (6,6), I'd have more central options, but I'd be giving up a clear, immediate scoring opportunity.\n\n**Strategic Decision & Plan for Next Turns:**\nThe principle from [snake.wits.ai](https://snake.wits.ai/docs) is to eat apples and grow. The [github.com](https://github.com/JeremyHub/Snake-Algorithms) AI emphasizes efficiency. Moving LEFT puts me one step from securing apple (4,7), increasing my lead. I must ensure the path remains clear next turn. The cell (4,7) is currently empty and not in the enemy's immediate path. This is a low-risk, high-reward move.\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to (5,7). Next turn, if (4,7) is still safe (not occupied by enemy head or my own body), move LEFT again to eat it. If for some reason it becomes unsafe, reassess and use UP/DOWN from (5,7) to maintain mobility.\n\nLEFT",

Safe.\n- **DOWN (5,6)**: Currently empty (`.`). Safe.\n- **LEFT (4,7)**: Contains apple `A`. Moving onto an apple is safe (I'll grow). Safe.\n- **RIGHT (6,7)**: Contains my own body segment `T` (from my body list: (6,7) is my second segment). **UNSAFE** (would die).\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 Analysis:**\nEnemy head at (0,1). Its possible moves:\n- UP (0,2): Its own body \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN (0,0): Empty \u2192 safe.\n- LEFT (-1,1): Off-board \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT (1,1): Contains apple `A`. Moving onto an apple is safe for it.\n\nIt will likely move RIGHT to eat the apple at (1,1) or DOWN to (0,0). No immediate head-on collision risk with me.\n\n**Apple Targeting:**\nApples at: (3,9), (1,1), (9,1), (4,7), (9,2).\n- Apple (4,7) is directly at LEFT from my head. I can eat it this turn by moving LEFT.\n- Apple (3,9) is far; path might be blocked by my body.\n- Apples (9,1) and (9,2) are far right, behind my body barrier.\n\nMoving LEFT to (4,7) eats the apple immediately, giving me 9 apples and growing. That puts me ahead of snake #1 (who has 8). This is a clear scoring opportunity.\n\n**Future Mobility After Eating:**\nIf I move LEFT to (4,7) and eat, my new head will be at (4,7), and my tail will stay where it is (since I grow). My body will extend: the new segment will be added at the old tail position? Actually in Snake, when you eat, you grow by adding a segment at the tail end next turn. So my body length increases, but the tail doesn't move immediately. My body list will become: head (4,7), then previous head (5,7), then (6,7), etc. So next turn, from (4,7), my safe moves will need to avoid my own body at (5,7) and others.\n\nLet's check potential safe moves from (4,7) after eating:\n- UP (4,8): Currently empty.\n- DOWN (4,6): Currently empty.\n- LEFT (3,7): Currently empty.\n- RIGHT (5,7): Will be my own body (previous head) \u2192 unsafe.\n\nSo I'd have UP, DOWN, LEFT as safe options next turn. That's good mobility.\n\n**Alternative Moves:**\n- UP to (5,8): Moves away from the apple, but keeps options open. From there, I could go to (4,8) or (5,9) later, but I'd miss the immediate apple.\n- DOWN to (5,6): Also moves away from the apple.\n\nGiven the objective is to eat apples and grow, moving LEFT to eat the apple is the best choice. It increases my score lead and is safe.\n\n**Head-on Collision Risk:**\nCould enemy snake #1 move to (4,7) this turn? Its head is at (0,1). It would need to move 4 steps right and 6 steps up in one turn, impossible. So no head-on collision.\n\n**Plan for Next Turns:**\nAfter eating apple at (4,7), reassess. My body will be longer, so I need to avoid trapping myself. I'll aim to navigate toward the right side where there are more apples (9,1) and (9,2), but I must ensure a path exists. Possibly move UP or DOWN from (4,7) to start circling around.\n\n**Decision:** Move LEFT to eat the apple.\n\nLEFT",

While safe, this retreats into the corner and delays eating the adjacent apple.

Safe.\n- **DOWN (4,6)**: Currently empty (`.`). Safe.\n- **LEFT (3,7)**: Currently empty (`.`). Safe.\n- **RIGHT (5,7)**: Contains my own body segment `T` (from my body list: (5,7) is my second segment). **UNSAFE** (would die).\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Apple Targeting:**\nApples at: (3,9), (9,1), (9,2), (5,4), (3,8).\n- Apple (3,8) is two steps away: LEFT then UP from my head.\n- Apple (3,9) is three steps: LEFT, UP, UP.\n- Apple (5,4) is far: DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN? Path may be blocked.\n- Apples (9,1) and (9,2) are far right, behind my long body.\n\nThe closest apple is (3,8). I can move LEFT to (3,7) this turn, setting up to move UP to (3,8) next turn to eat it. Moving UP now to (4,8) also gets me closer to (3,8) or (3,9).\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 Analysis:**\nEnemy head at (1,1). Its possible moves:\n- UP (1,2): Empty \u2192 safe.\n- DOWN (1,0): Empty \u2192 safe.\n- LEFT (0,1): Its own body \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT (2,1): Its own body \u2192 unsafe.\n\nIt will likely move UP or DOWN. It cannot reach my vicinity this turn.\n\n**Head-on Collision Risk:**\nNo enemy can reach my potential destination cells (3,7), (4,8), or (4,6) this turn. Safe.\n\n**Future Mobility:**\nFrom (4,7):\n- UP (4,8): From there, next moves: UP (4,9) empty, LEFT (3,8) apple, RIGHT (5,8) empty. Good options.\n- DOWN (4,6): From there, next moves: DOWN (4,5) empty, LEFT (3,6) empty, RIGHT (5,6) empty. Also good.\n- LEFT (3,7): From there, next moves: UP (3,8) apple, DOWN (3,6) empty, LEFT (2,7) empty. Good.\n\nAll three safe moves offer good future mobility. However, moving LEFT positions me to eat the apple at (3,8) next turn, which is a clear short-term goal. Moving UP also gets me closer to apples (3,8) and (3,9), but I'd be adjacent to (3,8) from (4,8) as well.\n\n**Strategic Plan for Next Turns:**\nAim to eat the apple at (3,8) next. After that, consider circling toward the right-side apples (9,1),(9,2) by moving down and right, but be mindful of my long body creating a barrier. Avoid getting trapped in the top-left corner. Keep an eye on enemy #1; it's currently confined to the left-bottom area.\n\n**Decision:** Moving LEFT to (3,7) sets up the most direct path to the nearest apple (3,8) while keeping options open.\n\nLEFT",

This keeps the snake alive and opens up multiple paths for the next turn (LEFT to 0, 0 or RIGHT to 2, 0).

Moving UP eats it immediately, giving me 10 apples and growing by 1 segment next turn.\n- Apple (3,9) is one step above (3,8) \u2014 after eating (3,8), I could consider moving up to (3,9) next if safe.\n- Other apples are farther away.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 Analysis:**\nEnemy head at (1,0).

Safe.\n\n**Future Mobility & Growth:**\nIf I eat the apple at (3,8) by moving UP:\n- My new head will be at (3,8), and I will grow by 1 segment next turn (tail stays put). My body will extend, but the new head position is currently an apple cell, so it will become my head.\n- Next turn, from (3,8), possible moves: UP to (3,9) (another apple), LEFT to (2,8) (empty), RIGHT to (4,8) (empty, but note my body at (4,8)? Wait, check board: (4,8) is `T` (my tail segment).

So (4,8) is not in my body\u2014it's empty. Good.\n- However, moving UP to (3,8) might reduce future mobility if I get boxed in near the top edge. But I can then go LEFT, RIGHT, or further UP.\n\nAlternative safe moves:\n- LEFT to (2,7): keeps me safe but delays eating.\n- DOWN to (3,6): moves away from the closest apples.\n\n**Strategic Plan for Next Turns:**\nEat the apple at (3,8) now to reach 10 apples. Then assess: if (3,9) is still there and safe, consider eating it to gain another point. Be mindful of my long body creating barriers; after eating, I'll be longer, so need to avoid circling into myself. Consider moving rightward afterward to open space and target the apples at (9,1) and (9,2) eventually. Keep an eye on enemy #1; it's currently at the bottom left and may try to come up.\n\n**Decision:** Moving UP eats the nearest apple, increases my score, and is safe.

So I'd have two safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT) after eating, but moving UP is off-board.\n- This could be slightly risky if I get trapped along the top edge, but I can move laterally.\n\nAlternative safe moves:\n- LEFT to (2,8): moves toward the left side, opens space, but delays eating.\n- RIGHT to (4,8): moves toward the center/right, closer to apples (5,4), (9,1), (9,2).\n\n**Strategic Plan for Next Turns:**\nEat the apple at (3,9) now to reach 11 apples and extend my lead. After eating, I'll be at the top edge. Next turn, I should move LEFT or RIGHT to avoid being trapped. Since my body is long and loops around, I need to be careful not to encircle myself. The right side has more apples, so after eating (3,9), moving RIGHT to (4,9) might be better to start heading toward (5,4) and the right-side apples. Keep monitoring enemy #1; it's at the bottom and may come up the left side.\n\n**Decision:** Moving UP eats the nearest apple, increases my score lead, and is safe. It's the most advantageous immediate move.\n\nUP",

The left side has apple (2,7) but also more of my own body segments in the area (see column 2, rows 2-4: my body). Moving right might give better long-term access to apples and open space.\n\n**Strategic Plan for Next Turns:**\nAfter moving right, next turn I should move DOWN to (4,8) to start descending toward the apples at (5,4) and (6,1). Keep an eye on enemy #1; it\u2019s at the bottom and may move up the left side. My lead is 11 apples vs. 10, so maintaining and extending the lead is key.\n\n**Decision:** Both LEFT and RIGHT are safe.

          "rationale": "Looking at the current board, my head is at **(5,9)**. Let's check each possible move for immediate safety.\n\n**Immediate Safety Check (from (5,9)):**\n- **UP (5,10)**: Off-board (y=10 invalid). **UNSAFE**.\n- **DOWN (5,8)**: Board shows '.' at row 8, column 5. Currently empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT (4,9)**: Contains my own body (segment immediately behind my head). **UNSAFE**.\n- **RIGHT (6,9)**: Board shows '.' at row 9, column 6. Currently empty. Safe.\n\nSo only **DOWN** and **RIGHT** are safe.\n\n**Apple Targeting:**\nApples at: (9,1), (9,2), (5,4), (2,7), (6,1).\nFrom (5,9):\n- To (5,4): Manhattan distance = |0| + |5| = 5.\n- To (6,1): |1| + |8| = 9.\n- To (9,1): |4| + |8| = 12.\n- To (9,2): |4| + |7| = 11.\n- To (2,7): |3| + |2| = 5.\n\nClosest are (5,4) and (2,7) at distance 5.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (5,8) gets me closer to (5,4) (distance becomes 4).\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (6,9) gets me slightly closer to (5,4)? Actually distance from (6,9) to (5,4) is |1|+|5|=6, so it increases. But it gets me closer to the apples on the right side (6,1), (9,1), (9,2).\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 Analysis:**\nEnemy head at (5,0). Its possible moves:\n- UP (5,1): Board shows '.' (row 1, col 5 is '.'). Safe.\n- DOWN (5,-1): Off-board. **UNSAFE**.\n- LEFT (4,0): Board shows 'T' (its own body). **UNSAFE**.\n- RIGHT (6,0): Board shows '.' (empty). Safe.\n\nIt will likely move UP or RIGHT. It cannot reach my vicinity this turn (needs at least 8 moves upward).\n\n**Head-on Collision Risk:**\nNo enemy can reach (5,8) or (6,9) this turn. Safe.\n\n**Future Mobility & Growth:**\n- **DOWN to (5,8)**: From (5,8), possible next moves:\n    - UP (back to (5,9)): my body \u2192 unsafe.\n    - DOWN (5,7): board shows 'T' (my body at row 7, col 5) \u2192 unsafe.\n    - LEFT (4,8): board shows 'T' (my body) \u2192 unsafe.\n    - RIGHT (6,8): board shows '.' (empty) \u2192 safe.\n  So moving DOWN leaves me with only **one safe move** next turn (RIGHT). That's risky\u2014could trap me.\n- **RIGHT to (6,9)**: From (6,9), possible next moves:\n    - UP (6,10): off-board \u2192 unsafe.\n    - DOWN (6,8): board shows '.' (empty) \u2192 safe.\n    - LEFT (5,9): my body \u2192 unsafe.\n    - RIGHT (7,9): board shows 'T' (my body) \u2192 unsafe.\n  So moving RIGHT also leaves only **one safe move** next turn (DOWN).\n\nBoth safe moves lead to a position with only one safe follow-up. This is concerning.\n\n**Need to look deeper:** Perhaps I can plan a sequence. My goal is to stay alive and eventually reach apples. The apple at (5,4) is directly below me. To get there, I need to descend without trapping myself.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (5,8), next turn I must go RIGHT to (6,8). From (6,8):\n- Possible moves: UP (6,9) (my body?), LEFT (5,8) (my body?), DOWN (6,7) (board shows 'T'? row 7 col 6 is 'T' - my body), RIGHT (7,8) (board shows 'T' - my body). That looks like all unsafe! That means moving DOWN to (5,8) actually leads to a dead end next turn? Let's verify the board: at (6,9) is my body, (5,8) will be my head's previous position, (6,7) is my body (yes, from the body list: (6,7) is present), (7,8) is my body. So indeed, from (6,8) after two moves, all four directions are occupied. That's a trap.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (6,9), next turn I must go DOWN to (6,8). That's the same (6,8) position as above, just arrived at a turn later. From (6,8) as we saw, all directions may be blocked depending on body movement. However, by the time I reach (6,8) on turn 40, my tail might have moved? Let's simulate body movement.\n\nMy body length is 12 (11 apples + 1 initial). When I move without eating, the tail moves. My body list: head (5,9), then (4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (7,9), (7,8). That's 12 segments. If I move RIGHT to (6,9) without eating, I add new head (6,9) and remove tail (7,8). So new body becomes: head (6,9), then (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (6,8), (7,9), (6,9?) Wait that's duplicate? Let's recalc carefully:\n\nCurrent body: [(5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (7,9), (7,8)]\nAfter move RIGHT: new head = (6,9). Add to front. Remove tail (7,8). New body: [(6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (6,8), (7,9)]? That's 11 segments? I'm missing one. Let's count: 1:(6,9), 2:(5,9), 3:(4,9), 4:(3,9), 5:(3,8), 6:(3,7), 7:(4,7), 8:(5,7), 9:(6,7), 10:(6,8), 11:(7,9). That's 11. But my length should be 12 because I haven't eaten. Something's off: initial body list length is 12. After moving without eating, length stays 12. I removed tail (7,8) but didn't add a segment? Actually adding new head and removing tail keeps length same. So new body should have 12 segments. My list above has 11 because I omitted the segment that was at position 11 originally? Let's re-index: current body indices: 0:(5,9), 1:(4,9), 2:(3,9), 3:(3,8), 4:(3,7), 5:(4,7), 6:(5,7), 7:(6,7), 8:(6,8), 9:(6,9), 10:(7,9), 11:(7,8). After move: new head (6,9) inserted at 0, shift others, remove last (index 11). So new body: 0:(6,9), 1:(5,9), 2:(4,9), 3:(3,9), 4:(3,8), 5:(3,7), 6:(4,7), 7:(5,7), 8:(6,7), 9:(6,8), 10:(7,9). That's 11 segments. Where did segment (7,8) go? It was removed. So length decreased by 1? That's wrong. Wait, I think I made a mistake: the body list given includes the head and all segments. Length = number of segments = number of apples collected + 1. I have 11 apples, so length = 12. The list provided has 12 tuples? Let's count: (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (7,9), (7,8). That's 12. Good.\n\nAfter moving RIGHT without eating: new head (6,9) added to front, tail (7,8) removed. So new body: (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (6,8), (7,9). That's 11 segments! That means my tail was (7,8) and it's gone, but my length should remain 12. So there must be another segment somewhere? Actually, maybe the body list is ordered head to tail, but after moving, the segment at index 10 (7,9) becomes the new tail? Let's check: original index 10 is (7,9), index 11 is (7,8). After removal of index 11, index 10 becomes the last, so tail is (7,9). That's still 12 segments? No, we have indices 0 to 10 inclusive: that's 11 segments. I'm missing one. Let's list indices after move:\n0: (6,9) new head\n1: (5,9) old head\n2: (4,9)\n3: (3,9)\n4: (3,8)\n5: (3,7)\n6: (4,7)\n7: (5,7)\n8: (6,7)\n9: (6,8)\n10: (7,9) old index 10\nThat's 11. So either the body length is actually 11 (maybe apples collected is 10?), but the info says apples collected: 11. This is confusing. Perhaps the body list includes the head only once, and length = number of segments = list length. So list length 12 means 12 segments, which matches 11 apples + 1. After a non-eating move, list length should stay 12. My new list has length 11, so I must have made an off-by-one error. Actually, when we remove the tail, we remove one segment, and when we add a new head, we add one segment. Net change zero. So new list should have same length. My new list missing one segment because I removed (7,8) but didn't include the segment that was at index 10? Wait, index 10 is (7,9). That becomes index 10 in new list (since we removed the last element, the list shifts). So all segments from old index 0-10 become new index 1-11? Let's do it algorithmically:\n\nOld list: A[0]...(A[11])\nNew list: B[0] = new head\nB[1] = A[0]\nB[2] = A[1]\n...\nB[12] = A[11]? No, length is 12, indices 0-11.\nWe remove A[11], so we only copy A[0] to A[10] to B[1] to B[11]. That gives B[0] to B[11] = 12 elements. So B[11] = A[10] = (7,9). So new tail is (7,9). So new body list: (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9), (3,8), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (6,8), (7,9)? That's still 11? Let's count: 0 to 10 inclusive is 11. I need index up to 11, so 12 elements. So B[11] exists. B[11] = A[10] = (7,9). So B indices 0 through 11: 12 elements. My written list only went to index 10. So the full new list is: 0:(6,9), 1:(5,9), 2:(4,9), 3:(3,9), 4:(3,8), 5:(3,7), 6:(4,7), 7:(5,7), 8:(6,7), 9:(6,8), 10:(7,9), 11:(7,9)? No, that duplicates. Actually A[10] is (7,9). So B[11] = (7,9). But B[10] should be A[9] which is (6,9)? Wait A[9] is (6,9) from original list. That's already the new head. So we have a conflict: new head is (6,9), but A[9] is also (6,9). That means the old body already had (6,9) as a segment. So after moving, we will have two (6,9) segments? That's not allowed. This suggests my body list might be incorrect or I'm misinterpreting.\n\nGiven the complexity, I'll trust the board representation for safety checks. The board shows at (6,9) there is a 'T' (my body). So moving RIGHT into (6,9) would be moving into my own body! That means my earlier check was wrong. Let's look at the board again:\n\nRow 9: \". . . T T 0 T T . .\"\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nAt col 6, row 9: 'T' (my body). So (6,9) is occupied by my body. Therefore moving RIGHT is **UNSAFE**.\n\nThat changes everything. Re-evaluate:\n\nFrom (5,9):\n- UP: (5,10) off-board \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN: (5,8) '.' \u2192 safe.\n- LEFT: (4,9) 'T' \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT: (6,9) 'T' \u2192 unsafe.\n\nSo only **DOWN** is safe.\n\nI must move DOWN to (5,8).\n\nNow, let's consider future from (5,8). As I thought earlier, next turn from (5,8), only RIGHT might be safe? Let's check board for (5,8) neighbors:\n- UP (5,9): my head's current position, will become body after I move. So next turn it will be my body \u2192 unsafe.\n- DOWN (5,7): board shows 'T' (my body) \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT (4,8): board shows 'T' (my body) \u2192 unsafe.\n- RIGHT (6,8): board shows '.' (empty) \u2192 safe.\n\nSo indeed, only RIGHT is safe next turn. That's risky, but I have no choice this turn.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** After moving DOWN to (5,8), next turn I must go RIGHT to (6,8). From (6,8), I need to check options then. Possibly I can then go DOWN to (6,7)? But (6,7) is currently my body, but by then my tail may have moved? My tail is at (7,8) currently. After I move DOWN (no eat), tail will move to (7,9)? Actually, after moving DOWN, new head (5,8), remove tail (7,8). So (7,8) becomes empty. But (6,7) remains my body. So from (6,8) next turn, (6,7) will still be my body. So DOWN would be unsafe. LEFT (5,8) will be my body. RIGHT (7,8) will become empty? After this turn, (7,8) is vacated. So RIGHT might be safe. UP (6,9) is my body. So from (6,8), only RIGHT might be safe. That's a narrow path.\n\nI need to think about eating an apple soon to grow and possibly change dynamics. The apple at (5,4) is below. I need to navigate down the right side. Perhaps I can go RIGHT after (6,8) to (7,8), then down to (7,7), etc.\n\nGiven the immediate danger, I have only one safe move: DOWN.\n\n**Long-term note for next turn:** You are at (5,8). Only safe move is RIGHT to (6,8). Then from (6,8), likely only safe move is RIGHT to (7,8) (since (6,7) is body, (5,8) is body, (6,9) is body). Check board then for vacancies. Goal is to descend toward apple (5,4) via the right edge.\n\nDOWN",

Let's check immediate safety for each direction:\n\n**Immediate Safety Check (from (5,8)):**\n- **UP (5,9)**: Contains my own body (segment immediately behind my head). **UNSAFE**.\n- **DOWN (5,7)**: Board shows 'T' (my body). **UNSAFE**.\n- **LEFT (4,8)**: Board shows 'T' (my body). **UNSAFE**.\n- **RIGHT (6,8)**: Board shows '.' (empty). **SAFE**.\n\nOnly **RIGHT** is safe. I must move RIGHT to (6,8).\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 Analysis:**\nEnemy head at (6,0). Its possible moves:\n- UP (6,1): Board shows 'A' (apple) at (6,1). That's empty for movement? Actually 'A' indicates an apple, not a snake. So it's safe for the enemy.\n- DOWN (6,-1): Off-board. **UNSAFE**.\n- LEFT (5,0): Board shows 'T' (its own body). **UNSAFE**.\n- RIGHT (7,0): Board shows '.' (empty). Safe.\n\nIt will likely move UP (toward apple) or RIGHT. It cannot reach my vicinity this turn.\n\n**Head-on Collision Risk:**\nNo enemy can reach (6,8) this turn. Safe.\n\n**Future Mobility from (6,8):**\nFrom (6,8) next turn, possible moves:\n- UP (6,9): Will be my body (current head position becomes body). **UNSAFE**.\n- DOWN (6,7): Currently my body, and after I move RIGHT, my tail will move? Let's simulate: After moving RIGHT without eating, new head (6,8), remove tail (7,9). So (6,7) remains my body. **UNSAFE**.\n- LEFT (5,8): Will be my body (current head position). **UNSAFE**.\n- RIGHT (7,8): Currently '.' (empty). After my move, it remains empty. **SAFE**.\n\nSo from (6,8), only RIGHT will be safe next turn. That's a narrow path, but I have no choice now.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI'm trapped in a corridor along the right edge. My immediate goal is to survive and try to reach an apple to grow and possibly open up space. The closest apple is (5,4) below me, but I'm blocked by my own body. I need to navigate down the right side: after (6,8) \u2192 (7,8) \u2192 (7,7) \u2192 etc., eventually looping around to approach (5,4) from the right or bottom. Meanwhile, enemy snake is far away on the bottom row. I need to monitor its movement and avoid head-on collisions in the future.\n\nRIGHT",

The square is safe (no body segments there). After eating, I grow, and my new head is at (6, 1) with 3 safe follow-up directions (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).\n*   **DOWN**: Fatal. Moves to (6, -1), which is off the board.\n*   **LEFT**: Fatal. Moves to (5, 0), which is my own neck (the segment immediately following my head).\n*   **RIGHT**: Moves to (7, 0). This square is safe and empty. However, this move doesn't eat an apple, keeping my score at 10. From (7, 0), I only have 2 safe follow-up directions (UP, RIGHT).\n\n**Enemy Situation:**\n\nThe enemy snake at (5, 8) is in a trap. From (5, 8), all directions except LEFT are fatal (UP to neck at (5,9), DOWN to body at (5,7), RIGHT to body at (6,8)). After moving LEFT to (4, 8) on turn 40, the enemy will be completely surrounded by its own body with no safe moves on turn 41. The enemy will die on turn 41 regardless of my move, and I will win immediately when that happens.\n\n**Decision:**\nMove **UP** to eat the apple at (6, 1) and increase my score to 11. The enemy will die on turn 41, and I'll win with a higher score.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nThe enemy snake is trapped and will die on turn 41. After eating the apple at (6, 1), the game will end and I win.\n\nUP",
