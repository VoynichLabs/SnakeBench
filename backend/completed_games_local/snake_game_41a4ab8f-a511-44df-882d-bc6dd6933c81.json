(5, 8) far.  \n\nClosest is (3, 2), but it\u2019s at y=2, x=3.  \nFrom (4, 0):  \n- UP (4,1) \u2192 distance to (3,2) = 2.  \n- LEFT (3,0) \u2192 distance to (3,2) = 2.  \n- RIGHT (5,0) \u2192 distance to (3,2) = 4.  \n\nSo UP or LEFT both bring me equally closer in Manhattan distance.  \n\n**Future options after each move:**  \n- UP to (4,1): next turn can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN back to (4,0) safe since no body yet).  \n- LEFT to (3,0): next turn can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN out of bounds). Slightly fewer options (2 safe moves if we count out-of-bounds as unsafe).  \nSo UP seems better for keeping future options open.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving UP to (4,1), aim toward (3,2) apple, but watch enemy at (2,2) \u2014 they might also go for (3,2) apple next turn, which could cause head-on collision if we both move into (3,2) simultaneously. So maybe go to (3,1) first to be safe? That\u2019s something to decide next turn.  \n\n**Final choice:** UP keeps options open and moves toward nearest apple.  \n\nUP",

No body yet, so no self-collision.  \n\n**Check enemy body collision:**  \nEnemy body at (3, 2). None of my moves go there.  \n\n**Check head-on collision risk:**  \nEnemy head at (3, 3). Enemy's possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (3, 4)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 2) (into its own body \u2014 enemy AI will avoid that)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 3)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 3)  \n\nSo enemy's likely safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nMy possible moves and enemy's possible moves overlap:  \n- If I go UP to (5, 2) and enemy goes RIGHT to (4, 3) \u2192 no collision.  \n- If I go LEFT to (4, 1) and enemy goes RIGHT to (4, 3) \u2192 no collision.  \n- If I go RIGHT to (6, 1) and enemy goes anywhere \u2192 no collision.  \n- If I go DOWN to (5, 0) and enemy goes anywhere \u2192 no collision.  \n\nActually, enemy can't reach any of my possible target cells in one move from (3, 3).  \nDistance from (3, 3) to my possible cells:  \n- (5, 2): dx=2, dy=1 \u2192 not adjacent (distance 3)  \n- (5, 0): dx=2, dy=3 \u2192 not adjacent  \n- (4, 1): dx=1, dy=2 \u2192 not adjacent  \n- (6, 1): dx=3, dy=2 \u2192 not adjacent  \n\nSo no possible head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**Apple proximity from (5, 1):**  \n- (6, 3): dx=1, dy=2 \u2192 Manhattan distance 3  \n- (3, 4): dx=2, dy=3 \u2192 distance 5  \n- (5, 8): dx=0, dy=7 \u2192 distance 7  \n- (0, 7): dx=5, dy=6 \u2192 distance 11  \n- (2, 8): dx=3, dy=7 \u2192 distance 10  \n\nClosest apple is (6, 3).  \n\n**Path toward (6, 3):**  \nFrom (5, 1):  \n- UP \u2192 (5, 2) \u2192 distance to (6, 3) = 2  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 1) \u2192 distance to (6, 3) = 2  \n- LEFT or DOWN \u2192 distance increases.  \n\nSo UP or RIGHT are equally close in Manhattan distance after one move.  \n\n**Future safety consideration:**  \nIf I go UP to (5, 2), next turn enemy could be at (3, 4) or (4, 3) etc.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (6, 1), next turn enemy will be farther from me.  \n\nI have no body, so space is wide open.  \nGoing RIGHT to (6, 1) keeps me near (6, 3) and away from enemy's probable path toward (3, 4) apple.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 1), I can go UP toward (6, 3) next turn, but must check enemy's position then.  \nEnemy might go to (3, 4) apple this turn, so we're not competing for same apple yet.  \n\n**Final choice:**  \nRIGHT keeps me safe, moves toward nearest apple, and leaves options open.  \n\nRIGHT",

Since I\u2019m shorter (length 2 vs enemy length 3), I should avoid risky head-on collisions \u2014 enemy might be more aggressive, but I shouldn\u2019t gamble.  \n\nBetter to stay alive and get into a safer position to target apples later.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,4), check enemy\u2019s new head position, then consider moving toward apple (6,7) via LEFT/UP if safe, or toward (5,8) if enemy not blocking.
