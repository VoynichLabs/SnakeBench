Backtracking.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to (3, 1). Distance to apple (3, 3) becomes 2 steps (2 Up). Distance to apple (8, 1) becomes 5 steps (5 Right).\n\nAnalysis:\nThe nearest apple is (3, 3), which is at a Manhattan distance of 3 from my current position (2, 1).\nThe enemy at (5, 7) is closest to the apple at (5, 4) (3 steps away).\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 1), I am 2 steps from apple (3, 3) (at (3, 2) and (3, 3)).\nIf I move UP to (2, 2), I am 2 steps from apple (3, 3) (at (3, 2) and (3, 3) or (2, 3) and (3, 3)).\n\nMoving RIGHT is slightly better because it also maintains a path toward the apples on the far right (8, 1), (8, 3), and (8, 5) while still being very efficient for the (3, 3) apple. However, moving UP puts me on a more direct vertical path to intercept (3, 3) more flexibly. Let's look at move RIGHT. From (3, 1), I can go UP to (3, 2) then UP to (3, 3). This is safe and keeps me away from the enemy.\n\nPlan:\nProceed toward apple (3, 3) by moving RIGHT to (3, 1) and then UP.

This is generally a good direction as I am already centralized.\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n\nThe goal is to move towards apples while maintaining safety and maximizing future options.\nThe right side (x=8) offers three apples relatively close together. Moving RIGHT to (6, 4) targets these.\n\n*   If I move DOWN to (5, 3), I am equidistant from (2, 3) and (8, 3).\n*   If I move RIGHT to (6, 4), I commit to the x=8 apples, which looks like a good harvest zone.\n\nGiven that Snake 0 is positioned far left/down, and likely moving to (2, 3) (or perhaps (4, 3) or (3, 4)), moving RIGHT to (6, 4) allows me to focus on my own goal without immediate engagement or blocking issues.\n\nLet's commit to the RIGHT side.\n\n**Long-term Strategy (Next few turns):**\nT6: Move to (7, 4) (RIGHT).\nT7: Move to (8, 4).

New information shows an apple at (2, 4), which is 1 step UP from Snake 0's head. It is highly probable Snake 0 moves UP to (2, 4) this turn.\n\n**Considering Moves for ID 1 (Head: (6, 4), Body: (5, 4)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 5):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe.\n    *   **Proximity:** MHD to (8, 5) becomes 2 + 0 = 2.

This is equally good for either (8, 3) or (8, 5) and keeps me centralized along y=4.\n\n**Comparison of Safe Moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT):**\n\n*   **RIGHT (7, 4):** Keeps Y-level, allowing easy transition to 8,Y apples next turn, and maintains flexibility (can go UP/DOWN/RIGHT later).\n*   **UP (6, 5):** Commits slightly more strongly to the upper half, excellent positioning for (8, 5).\n*   **DOWN (6, 3):** Commits slightly more strongly to the lower half, excellent positioning for (8, 3).\n\nBoth (8, 3) and (8, 5) are 3 steps away, and all options (UP/DOWN/RIGHT) reduce that distance to 2 steps.\n\nGiven the cluster of apples (8, 1), (8, 3), (8, 5), staying central is often the best for flexibility. Moving to (7, 4) allows me to assess Snake 0's next move (likely eating at (2, 4)) and choose between (8, 3) and (8, 5) in T7.\n\nLet's choose **RIGHT**. This is a steady continuation of the plan from the previous turn, moving me one step closer to all three apples on the right flank.\n\n**Future Plan (T7 and T8):**\nT7: (7, 4) -> (8, 4).

It has no immediate apple targets nearby. It might continue moving left or try to move towards (5, 8) or (0, 1).

It places me at (8, 4), which is 1 step away from both apples. This is the most direct path into the apple cluster area.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT):**\n\nAll three safe moves position me optimally for the next turn (T8) to consume an apple.\n\n*   If I move **UP (7, 5)**: I can eat (8, 5) in T8 (move RIGHT).\n*   If I move **DOWN (7, 3)**: I can eat (8, 3) in T8 (move RIGHT).\n*   If I move **RIGHT (8, 4)**: I can eat (8, 3) (move DOWN) or (8, 5) (move UP) in T8.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (8, 4) is slightly more flexible, as it puts me right in the middle of the cluster vertically. I could choose based on what apple is easier to target afterward (e.g., (8, 1) is below (8, 3), favoring a DOWN movement path if I eat (8, 3)).\n\nSince both (8, 3) and (8, 5) are equally close and equally desirable:\n1. Moving RIGHT to (8, 4) secures the area and keeps both targets 1 step away for T8.\n2. If I move UP or DOWN, I commit slightly more to that target, which is fine, but less flexible.\n\nGiven my plan is to consume the apples in the (x=8) column, moving to (8, 4) is the most efficient way to achieve that goal in two steps (T7 move, T8 move = apple eaten).\n\n**Plan for T8:** From (8, 4), I will likely choose to move DOWN to (8, 3) to eat that apple, placing myself closer to (8, 1) afterward.\n\nLet's choose **RIGHT**.\n\nRIGHT",

Strategy and Evaluation:**\nSnake #1 is currently at (8, 4). They are extremely close to a cluster of three apples at (8, 5), (8, 3), and (8, 1). It is unlikely I can beat them to those specific apples without a head-on confrontation or risk.\nThe apple at (5, 8) is roughly 6 steps away from me: (2,5) -> (3,5) -> (4,5) -> (5,5) -> (5,6) -> (5,7) -> (5,8).\nThe apple at (0, 1) is roughly 6 steps away from me: (2,5) -> (1,5) -> (0,5) -> (0,4) -> (0,3) -> (0,2) -> (0,1).\n\nSnake #1's head is at (8, 4). If they go UP to (8, 5), they eat an apple. If they go DOWN to (8, 3), they eat an apple. They are currently controlling that vertical line.\n\nI should prioritize (5, 8) as it is in open space and keeps me away from the wall-hugging Snake #1. Moving RIGHT puts me on a path to intersect the middle of the board. UP is also good for positioning. Between the two, RIGHT starts making horizontal progress toward the apples in the upper and right quadrants immediately.\n\n**3. Long-term Plan:**\nMove toward (5, 8) while monitoring Snake #1. If Snake #1 continues to occupy the x=8 column, I will secure (5, 8) and then reassess the feasibility of grabbing (0, 1) or challenging for the remaining apples if Snake #1 moves away.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy snake #0 moved UP to (2, 5), clearly heading towards (5, 8) or trying to navigate upwards and right. It is still far from my immediate targets.\n\n**Immediate Goal:** Consume one of the nearby apples: (8, 3) or (8, 5).\n\n**Distances (Manhattan) from (8, 4):**\n1.

It is an apple.\n    *   **Outcome:** Eat apple (8, 5). Grow to length 3. Head moves to (8, 5), body remains at (8, 4), (7, 4). Score increases.\n    *   **Future Path:** After eating (8, 5), the next closest targets are (8, 3) (2 steps away) and (5, 8) (3 steps away).\n\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe. It is an apple.\n    *   **Outcome:** Eat apple (8, 3). Grow to length 3. Head moves to (8, 3), body remains at (8, 4), (7, 4). Score increases.\n    *   **Future Path:** After eating (8, 3), the next closest target is (8, 1) (2 steps away).

Places me 1 step farther from the apples (8, 3) and (8, 5). This is suboptimal.\n\n**Conclusion:** Both UP and DOWN result in eating an apple and are equally safe regarding the enemy (who is far away).\n\nSince (8, 1) is a nearby target after consuming (8, 3), moving DOWN seems to set up a cleaner linear sweep of the targets in the x=8 column: (8, 5), then (8, 3), then (8, 1). Wait, I am choosing between (8, 5) and (8, 3).\n\nIf I choose DOWN to (8, 3):\n*   T8: Eat (8, 3). Head (8, 3). New targets: (8, 1) (MHD=2), (8, 5) (MHD=2).\nIf I choose UP to (8, 5):\n*   T8: Eat (8, 5). Head (8, 5). New targets: (8, 3) (MHD=2), (8, 1) (MHD=4).\n\nSince the target (8, 1) is ultimately below both (8, 3) and (8, 5), eating (8, 3) first places me in a better position to immediately target (8, 1) next turn (a simple 'DOWN' move from (8, 3) in T9 gets me to (8, 2), then 'DOWN' in T10 gets me to (8, 1)). If I eat (8, 5), I have to move *down* two steps to get to (8, 3), and then *down* two more to get to (8, 1). No, that's wrong.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the sequence:\n1. Current pos: (8, 4).\n2. Option DOWN to (8, 3) [Eat]:\n   * T9 move to (8, 2) (if down). (8, 1) is 1 step away.\n   * T10 move to (8, 1) [Eat].\n   (Total 3 turns to get 3 apples sequentially: 8, 3 -> 8, 1 -> then probably 8, 5.)\n\n3.

(8, 3) is 2 steps away.\n   * If I move DOWN to (8, 4) in T9, I am back where I started (relative to the remaining apples).\n   * If I move DOWN to (8, 4), and then DOWN to (8, 3) in T10 [Eat].\n   (Sequence: 8, 5 -> 8, 3 -> 8, 1 requires 4 turns minimum.)\n\nMoving DOWN to (8, 3) seems slightly more efficient for chaining the consumption of (8, 3) and (8, 1), which are on the lower part of the board.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Continue clearing the x=8 column. Down to (8, 3) now (T8), then target (8, 1) (T9/T10). If the Snake 0 moves significantly closer to (5, 8), I may consider going for (8, 5) to deny 0 the central territory later, but for now, maximizing local apple eating is key.\n\nI choose DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

My immediate goal is to get (8, 1), (9, 2), or return up for (8, 5).

This is a great move as it keeps both immediate options open.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 3):**\n    *   **Safety:** Safe (empty space).\n    *   **Outcome:** Moves away from all 3 immediate targets (8, 1), (9, 2), (8, 5).

(8, 1) is 2 steps away. (8, 5) is 3 steps away. This is also a good option, focusing on (9, 2).\n\n**Comparing DOWN (to 8, 2) vs RIGHT (to 9, 3):**\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (8, 2):** Next turn, I can hit (8, 1) (DOWN) or (9, 2) (RIGHT). This keeps flexibility.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (9, 3):** Next turn, I can hit (9, 2) (DOWN). To reach (8, 1), I would need to go LEFT to (8, 3) (which is safe if the tail moves off it, but the head is only 1 move away from the current head), or DOWN/LEFT (2 moves).\n\nThe position (8, 2) is a pivot point that allows easy access to both (8, 1) and (9, 2). Targeting (8, 1) first continues the efficient sweep of the x=8 column. Since (8, 5) is also 2 steps away, the most efficient overall strategy right now is to clear the bottom right corner before moving back up.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (8, 2) keeps open the best subsequent apple consumption sequence (hit (8, 1) next turn).\n\n**Checking for Enemy Conflict:**\nEnemy #0 is at (3, 5). They are highly unlikely to interfere with the bottom-right quadrant this turn or in the near future. The move DOWN is safe.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\nClear (8, 1) next turn, then target (9, 2). Once the bottom right is clear, reassess the competition for (8, 5) and (5, 8).\n\nDOWN",

It poses no immediate threat to me in the bottom right corner.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving RIGHT to (9, 1) positions me perfectly to eat the (9, 2) apple next turn, continuing my sweep along the border.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:**\n1. Move RIGHT to (9, 1) [this turn].\n2. Move UP to (9, 2) to eat the apple.\n3. Assess if (8, 5) or (6, 7) is reachable before Snake #0, or if I should target the remote (0, 1) or (5, 8). I suspect Snake #0 will go for (5, 8) or (8, 5). I should be ready to move up the right wall (x=9) after eating (9, 2).\n\nRIGHT",

They are very close to (9, 2) and (0, 1).

Comparison:**\nMoving UP is the most direct path to the nearest apple at (5, 8). It also places me in a good position to grab (6, 7) immediately afterward. Snake #1 is currently at the bottom of the board and is not an immediate threat to the apples at the top center. Moving UP keeps me away from the area Snake #1 is currently occupying.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to reach (5, 8).

Moves one step further from (8, 5) (D=3 to D=4).\n\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 2):**\n    *   **Collision:** Moves into my body segment (9, 2). **FATAL.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 3):**\n    *   **Body Check:** Is (8, 3) currently occupied by my body? My body segments are (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (8, 2). (8, 3) is currently empty. **Safe.**\n    *   **Outcome:** Moves closer to (8, 5) (D=3 to D=2, path required is UP, UP). Best direction for the closest apple.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 3):**\n    *   **Collision:** Off the board (x=10). **FATAL.**\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining: UP (9, 4) and LEFT (8, 3).**\n\n**Enemy Snake #0 (Head: (6, 7)):**\nSnake #0 is already positioned well in the middle-top. Its two closest apples are (2, 7) (D=4) and (5, 8) (D=2). (8, 5) is also D=5 away.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n*   UP to (6, 8): D to (5, 8) is 1. D to (2, 7) is 4.\n*   DOWN to (6, 6): D to (5, 8) is 3. D to (2, 7) is 5.\n*   LEFT to (5, 7): Moves into its own body/tail. **FATAL.** (Wait, the body segments are (5, 7), (5, 6), (5, 5), (4, 5). Moving to (5, 7) is hitting its first body segment. This is fatal.)\n*   RIGHT to (7, 7): D to (5, 8) is 3. D to (2, 7) is 5.\n\nGiven that Snake #0's only safe moves appear to be UP, DOWN, and RIGHT, and (5, 8) is the closest apple (D=2), Snake #0 will likely go UP to (6, 8) which is one step towards (5, 8) (path: R, U or U, L).\n\nIf Snake #0 goes UP to (6, 8):\nNext turn, it can move LEFT to (5, 8) and eat the apple.\n\n**Collision Check (ID 1 vs. ID 0):**\nMy target (8, 3) is far from Snake #0's likely moves (6, 8) or (7, 7). No head-on collision or immediate danger from #0.\n\n**Strategy:**\nMove LEFT to (8, 3) to put myself on the shortest path to apple (8, 5).\n\nPath to (8, 5) from (8, 3): UP to (8, 4), then UP to (8, 5). Total 2 turns.\n\nIf I move UP to (9, 4):\nPath to (8, 5): LEFT to (8, 4), UP to (8, 5). Total 2 turns.\n\nBoth LEFT and UP take 2 turns to reach (8, 5). However, moving LEFT now opens up the internal board space sooner and establishes a better control over the middle-right area, away from the enemy's projected path towards the top (5, 8) or my secondary lower apple (5, 0).\n\nI will choose **LEFT** to aggressively pursue (8, 5).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (1-3 Turns Post-Move):**\n1. (Current Turn) Move LEFT to (8, 3). Tail moves to (8, 1). Body: (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 2).\n2. (Next Turn at 8, 3): Move UP to (8, 4). This protects the path to (8, 5).\n3. (Turn after, at 8, 4): Move UP to (8, 5) and eat the apple.\n\nLEFT",

It is likely Snake #1 will take (8,5).\n- Apple (0, 1) and (5, 0) are very far.\n\n3. **Strategic Choice:**\nI must move either UP or LEFT. \n- Moving UP (5, 9) puts me against the top wall.\n- Moving LEFT (4, 8) brings me closer to the cluster of apples at (2, 7) and (2, 6). \n\nSince my body currently blocks the direct path downward from x=5, I need to wrap around to the left or right. Moving LEFT toward (4, 8) is the most efficient path toward the nearest available apples. There is no immediate threat from Snake #1, as it is currently focused on the apple at (8, 5).\n\n4. **Future Pathing:**\nMove toward (2, 7) and (2, 6). Once I reach the x=2 column, I can descend to grab both apples. I will monitor Snake #1, who will likely be at (8, 5) or (8, 6) after this turn.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT toward (4, 8) to approach the apples at (2, 7) and (2, 6). Avoid the top boundary and navigate around my own body segments to reach the targets.\n\nLEFT",

Snake #0's likely move is LEFT to (4, 8). These are far apart. No head-on collision or body collision is possible this turn.\n\n**Strategy:**\nMove UP to (8, 5) to capture the apple, putting me tied with Snake #0 in score (5 apples each).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Post-Move):**\nAfter eating (8, 5), my head will be at (8, 5) and I will be length 6. The closest remaining apples will be (5, 0) (D=8) and (2, 6) (D=8). (5, 0) is easier to approach from the current position. I will likely move towards the lower part of the board, perhaps RIGHT to (9, 5) then DOWN, or DOWN to (8, 4) then LEFT towards the center. Given the enemy is moving left/center, heading towards (5, 0) or circling back towards (0, 1) seems a viable strategy, avoiding the central congestion for a turn or two.\n\nUP",

Next move options are (7, 3), (6, 4), (8, 4) (Body collision).\n*   Moving to (6, 5) (LEFT) brings me closer horizontally. Next move options are (5, 5), (6, 6), (6, 4).\n\nBoth look excellent. Let's analyze the enemy's movement.\n\n**Enemy Snake #0 Analysis (Head: (3, 8)):**\nEnemy goal is likely (2, 7) or (2, 6).\n*   (2, 7): D=1 (Closest)\n*   (2, 6): D=2\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 (Head 3, 8):\n*   UP to (3, 9): Safe. D to (2, 7) is 2.\n*   DOWN to (3, 7): Safe. D to (2, 7) is 1. (Optimal move).\n*   LEFT to (2, 8): Safe. D to (2, 7) is 1. (Optimal move).\n*   RIGHT to (4, 8): Moves onto body segment (4, 8). **FATAL.**\n\nThe enemy will almost certainly move to (3, 7) or (2, 8). Both take them one step away from our area and secures their path to the cluster of apples (2, 7) and (2, 6).\n\n**Comparing DOWN and LEFT for ID 1:**\n\n1.  **DOWN to (7, 4):**\n    *   Future moves towards (6, 1): (7, 3) (or 6, 4). This sets up a path down and then left.\n    *   Avoids congestion near the center-left where the enemy snake #0 might eventually expand its territory (around x=5, 6).\n\n2.  **LEFT to (6, 5):**\n    *   Future moves towards (6, 1): (5, 5), (6, 4). This essentially puts me in line with the target (6, 1) in the X-axis.\n    *   The path (6, 5) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 3) -> (6, 2) -> (6, 1) is a straight shot down.\n\n*Conclusion:* Moving LEFT to (6, 5) perfectly aligns the X-coordinate with the target (6, 1). This is geometrically the most efficient setup path.\n\nLet's check for proximity issues. The enemy tail moves from (5, 7) to (6, 7) or (5, 8).\nIf Snake #0 moves to (3, 7): Body: (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7). Tail segment (5, 7) becomes free.\nIf Snake #0 moves to (2, 8): Body: (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8). Tail segment (5, 7) becomes free.\n\nThe square (6, 5) is completely safe and clear of enemy movement.\n\n**Strategy:** Move LEFT to (6, 5). This reduces the distance to the target (6, 1) to D=4 and puts me on the same X-coordinate as the apple, allowing for a straight downward run in the subsequent turns.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Post-Move):**\nHead at (6, 5). Target (6, 1). Next move should primarily be DOWN to (6, 4) to maintain the X-alignment and aggressively pursue the apple. Continue moving DOWN until (6, 1) is reached. This sequence ensures a rapid apple acquisition, probably in 4 turns.\n\nLEFT",

The apple list provided for Turn 19 had apples at: (0, 1), (5, 0), **(2, 7)**, (2, 6), (6, 1).\nIt seems Snake #0 definitely ate the apple at (2, 7). The new apple list is: (0, 1), (5, 0), (2, 6), (6, 1), (5, 2). This means (2, 7) is now Snake #0's head, and a new apple spawned at (5, 2).\n\n**Target Apple Identification:**\nMy current position is (6, 4). My goal remains the closest apple: (6, 1).\n\n**Available Apples and Distances (Manhattan Distance from (6, 4)):**\n1. (6, 1): D= |6-6| + |4-1| = 3. **(Closest)**\n2. (5, 0): D= |6-5| + |4-0| = 1 + 4 = 5.\n3. (5, 2): D= |6-5| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3. (Also close, equal distance)\n4. (2, 6): D= |6-2| + |4-6| = 4 + 2 = 6.\n5. (0, 1): D= |6-0| + |4-1| = 6 + 3 = 9.\n\nI have two equally closest apples: (6, 1) and (5, 2).\n*   To reach (6, 1), I need to move DOWN 3 times.\n*   To reach (5, 2), I need to move LEFT then DOWN (or DOWN then LEFT).\n\nSince I am already heading DOWN towards (6, 1) and am perfectly aligned, continuing DOWN is the simplest and safest path.\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves for ID 1 (Head: (6, 4)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 5):**\n    *   **Collision:** Moves onto my body segment (6, 5). **FATAL (Moving backwards).**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 3):**\n    *   **Collision:** Safe (empty).\n    *   **Goal Proximity (to (6, 1)):** D= |6-6| + |3-1| = 2. (Optimal progress towards (6, 1)).\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 4):**\n    *   **Collision:** Safe (empty).\n    *   **Goal Proximity (to (6, 1)):** D= |5-6| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4. (Increases distance by 1).\n    *   **Goal Proximity (to (5, 2)):** D= |5-5| + |4-2| = 2. (Optimal move towards (5, 2)).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 4):**\n    *   **Collision:** Safe (empty).\n    *   **Goal Proximity (to (6, 1)):** D= |7-6| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4. (Increases distance by 1).\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.**\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving DOWN to (6, 3) reduces the distance to (6, 1) to D=2. This is the surest continuation of the current strategy.\n\nIf I chose LEFT, I would move towards (5, 2). This would also be D=2 away.\nHowever, moving DOWN maintains better escape routes (LEFT/RIGHT are available) because I am moving along the edge of my existing body (6, 3 is adjacent to (6, 4), and my body is at (6, 5), (7, 5)...).\n\nLet's check for enemy collision risks.\nEnemy Head #0 is at (2, 7). They are far away and are likely going for (2, 6) or perhaps (5, 2).\n\n*   If #0 goes for (2, 6):\n    *   UP to (2, 8): Safe.\n    *   DOWN to (2, 6): Eats apple. **Likely move.**\n    *   LEFT to (1, 7): Safe.\n    *   RIGHT to (3, 7): Hits body. **FATAL.**\n    #0 is very likely to move DOWN to (2, 6) and eat the apple. This poses no threat to me at (6, 3).\n\n*   If #0 goes for (5, 2):\n    *   This is distance 8. Highly unlikely when (2, 6) is distance 1.\n\nThe move DOWN to (6, 3) is safe, efficient, and continues the current trajectory towards apple (6, 1).\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (ID 1):**\nMove DOWN to (6, 3). Next turn, move DOWN to (6, 2). Turn 22, move DOWN to (6, 1) and eat the apple. After eating (6, 1), the immediate next target should be (5, 0), which would be D=1 away from (6, 1).\n\nDOWN",

My previous move was DOWN from (6, 4) to (6, 3). I am perfectly aligned to reach the apple at (6, 1).\nSnake #0's Head: (2, 6). This snake just ate an apple (likely one that was at (2, 6) on Turn 20, but the current list shows an apple at (2, 6) - *wait, this is a common issue with provided input format vs game progression.*\n\nLet's carefully verify Snake #0's move and length.\nT20: Head (2, 7), Length 7, Apples 6.\nT21: Head (2, 6), Body [(2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (6, 7)]. Length 8, Apples 7.\nThis confirms Snake #0 moved DOWN from (2, 7) to (2, 6) and ate an apple.\n\nThe current apple list provided for Turn 21 must be the apples **present immediately after Snake #0 ate one and before my move.**\nNew Apple List: (0, 1), (5, 0), (6, 1), (5, 2), (7, 6).\n*The apple at (2, 6) is gone.* If the input mistakenly listed (2, 6), I must ignore it based on the confirmed movement and scoring. I will prioritize the movement/scoring data because the apple list is often generated based on *remaining* apples *after* the move. Given the snake is *at* (2, 6) and increased length/score, that apple is gone. (7, 6) must be the new apple spawn location.\n\n**My Target Apple Identification:**\nMy current position is (6, 3). My primary goal is the closest apple: (6, 1).\n\n**Available Apples and Distances (Manhattan Distance from (6, 3)):**\n1. (6, 1): D= |6-6| + |3-1| = 2. **(Closest)**\n2. (5, 2): D= |6-5| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2. **(Tied closest)**\n3. (5, 0): D= |6-5| + |3-0| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n4. (7, 6): D= |6-7| + |3-6| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n5. (0, 1): D= |6-0| + |3-1| = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nI have two equally close apples: (6, 1) and (5, 2). I am already aligned for an easy two moves to (6, 1).\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves for ID 1 (Head: (6, 3)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 4):**\n    *   **Collision:** Moves onto my body segment (6, 4). **FATAL (Moving backwards).**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 2):**\n    *   **Collision:** Safe (empty).\n    *   **Goal Proximity (to (6, 1)):** D= 1. (Optimal progress towards (6, 1)).\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 3):**\n    *   **Collision:** Safe (empty).\n    *   **Goal Proximity (to (5, 2)):** D= |5-5| + |3-2| = 1. (Optimal progress towards (5, 2)).\n    *   (6, 1) proximity: D= 4.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 3):**\n    *   **Collision:** Safe (empty).\n    *   **Goal Proximity (to (6, 1)):** D= |7-6| + |3-1| = 3. (Increases distance by 1).\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.**\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n\nA move DOWN to (6, 2) assures I reach (6, 1) the subsequent turn (T22).\nA move LEFT to (5, 3) assures I reach (5, 2) the subsequent turn (T22).\n\nBoth moves are equally efficient in terms of reaching an apple quickly (2 turns). I should select the move that keeps me safer and offers better future positioning.\n\n*   If I move DOWN to (6, 2): I am still central vertically on the right side of the board. My tail is at (8, 4), and my body is spread to the right. Going further down corners me slightly but allows me to easily pivot towards (5, 0) next, or back up towards the center if needed.\n*   If I move LEFT to (5, 3): I am moving away from my body mass towards the center. This is generally good for maneuverability.\n\nLet's check the distance to the next closest targets after T22 move.\n\nScenario A: Move DOWN (6, 2) -> (6, 1) ATE. Next targets:\n*   From (6, 1): (5, 0) is D=2. (5, 2) is D=2. (7, 6) is D=6.\nScenario B: Move LEFT (5, 3) -> (5, 2) ATE. Next targets:\n*   From (5, 2): (6, 1) is D=2. (5, 0) is D=2. (7, 6) is D=6.\n\nBoth options lead to very similar resulting positions and follow-up targets. Since I started moving towards (6, 1), sticking with the plan (DOWN) is usually cleaner unless there's an immediate threat.\n\n**Enemy Threat Assessment:**\nEnemy Head #0 is at (2, 6).\nPossible moves for #0:\n1. UP to (2, 7): Moving backwards toward previous segment. **FATAL collision.** (2, 7) is occupied by its body.\n2. DOWN to (2, 5): Safe. Moves toward the bottom side.\n3. LEFT to (1, 6): Safe. Moves toward the left side.\n4. RIGHT to (3, 6): Safe.\n\nGiven #0 just ate an apple, it will likely try to stabilize its position or go for the next easiest apple, maybe (5, 2) (D=5) or (0, 1) (D=7). Since I am much closer to both (6, 1) and (5, 2), there is no immediate competition or collision risk with Snake #0.\n\nI will continue with the planned move to (6, 1). This requires moving DOWN.\n\n**Long-Term Strategy (ID 1):**\nMove DOWN to (6, 2). Next turn (T22), move DOWN to (6, 1) and eat the apple. After eating (6, 1), the snake should assess its position relative to remaining apples, likely targeting (5, 0) or circling back towards (5, 2).\n\nDOWN",

I previously moved DOWN from (6, 3). My immediate target is the apple at (6, 1).\n\n**Available Apples and Distances (Manhattan Distance from (6, 2)):**\n1. (6, 1): D= |6-6| + |2-1| = 1. **(Closest, immediate target)**\n2. (5, 2): D= |6-5| + |2-2| = 1. **(Tied Closest)**\n3. (5, 0): D= |6-5| + |2-0| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n4. (7, 6): D= |6-7| + |2-6| = 1 + 4 = 5.\n5. (0, 1): D= |6-0| + |2-1| = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\n**Identifying Safe Moves for ID 1 (Head: (6, 2)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 3):**\n    *   Collision: Moves onto my body segment (6, 3). **FATAL (Moving backwards).**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 1):**\n    *   Collision: Moves onto the apple at (6, 1). **SAFE, and I EAT.** (This is the intended move).\n\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 2):**\n    *   Collision: Moves onto the apple at (5, 2). **SAFE, and I EAT.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 2):**\n    *   Collision: Safe (empty).\n\n**Enemy Snake #0 Threat Assessment (Head: (2, 5)):**\nSnake #0 is long (8 segments) and positioned on the left side.\nPossible moves for #0 (avoiding its body and walls):\n*   To (2, 4) (DOWN): Safe.\n*   To (1, 5) (LEFT): Safe.\n*   To (3, 5) (RIGHT): Safe.\n*   To (2, 6) (UP): Moves into its body segment (2, 6). **FATAL.**\n\nSnake #0's likely targets are (5, 2) (D=3) or (0, 1) (D=6). If it moves RIGHT towards (3, 5), it gets closer to (5, 2). If it moves DOWN or LEFT, it targets (0, 1). Given its current position, Snake #0 is a direct competitor for (5, 2).\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\n\nI have two equally close apples I can reach this turn: (6, 1) and (5, 2).\n\n1.  **If I choose DOWN to (6, 1):** I secure the apple and position myself at (6, 1). This is slightly safer as Snake #0 is unlikely to be aiming for (6, 1) right now.\n2.  **If I choose LEFT to (5, 2):** I secure the apple and position myself at (5, 2). This apple is closer to Snake #0, and if Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (3, 5), it reduces the distance to (5, 2) to 2. While they won't reach it this turn, hitting (5, 2) first prevents them from claiming it easily on T23/T24.\n\nSince I am equally positioned to grab either apple and preempting the opponent is valuable, let's examine follow-up moves.\n\nIf I take (6, 1): New head (6, 1). Next target: (5, 2) (D=1) or (5, 0) (D=1).\n- To get to (5, 2), I move LEFT.\n- To get to (5, 0), I move DOWN, then LEFT.\n\nIf I take (5, 2): New head (5, 2). Next target: (6, 1) (D=1) or (5, 0) (D=2).\n- To get to (6, 1), I move RIGHT.\n- To get to (5, 0), I move DOWN, then potentially LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nBoth moves keep my options open and secure an apple. However, (5, 2) is a more contested apple because it is somewhat central and closer to Snake #0's likely path (if they decide to move RIGHT and up the middle). The apple at (6, 1) is relatively safe from the enemy.\n\nBy taking (6, 1) (moving DOWN), I continue my original path, placing my snake neatly on the bottom right quadrant. My tail will be where (6, 2) was, eventually clearing (6, 5) and opening up movement there. It secures an apple without engaging in a pseudo-race with the enemy for (5, 2).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (6, 1), and Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (3, 5), then on T23, I can efficiently grab (5, 2) by moving LEFT, while Snake #0 would only be at (4, 5) or (3, 4). My move to (6, 1) sets me up for a better follow-up sequence.\n\nI will move DOWN to secure the apple at (6, 1).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T23 onward):**\nAfter eating (6, 1), my head will be there. The remaining nearby apples are (5, 2) (D=1) and (5, 0) (D=1). I will aim for (5, 2) next by moving LEFT, unless pathing becomes obstructed.\n\nDOWN",

I can reach (5, 2) on T24.

By positioning myself at (5, 1), I preempt Snake #0 who is trying to push into the center.\n\n*   If I move LEFT to (5, 1):\n    *   T24: Target (5, 2) (UP) or (5, 0) (DOWN). Distance to either is 1.\n    *   If I take (5, 2) on T24, Snake #0 cannot take it immediately, even if they moved RIGHT (3, 4) -> (4, 4).

It will almost certainly take one of those apples immediately.\n- If I move RIGHT to (3, 3), I risk being cut off by the enemy snake which is already positioned in the (5, 1)-(7, 1) area.\n\n3. **Strategic Choice:**\nMoving **LEFT** or **DOWN** is safer than moving RIGHT. \n- Moving **LEFT** to (1, 3) puts me on a direct path to the apple at (0, 1). \n- Moving **DOWN** to (2, 2) is also safe, but slightly slower toward (0, 1).\n- Given that the enemy is clustered around the right-side apples, securing the isolated apple at (0, 1) is the highest percentage play to increase the score while keeping distance from the opponent.\n\nPlan: Move to (1, 3) and then toward (0, 1). This keeps the tail trailing behind me in a way that doesn't trap me against the left wall.\n\nLEFT",

I am perfectly positioned to attack the two adjacent apples: (5, 2) (UP) and (5, 0) (DOWN). Enemy Snake #0 is currently at (2, 3), still somewhat far, but closing in on the central apples or potentially targeting (0, 1). I must secure one of these two apples this turn.\n\n**My Current Position (5, 1) and Target Apples:**\n1. (5, 2) [UP]: Distance 1.\n2. (5, 0) [DOWN]: Distance 1.\n\n**Identifying Safe Moves for ID 1 (Head: (5, 1)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 2):**\n    *   **Collision Check:** (5, 2) has an apple. Safe from immediate physical collision with my own body or walls.\n    *   **Battle Check:** Is Snake #0 targeting (5, 2)?\n        *   #0 is at (2, 3). Distance to (5, 2) is |5-2| + |2-3| = 3 + 1 = 4.\n        *   If #0 moves RIGHT to (3, 3) (D=3 to (5, 2)).\n        *   If #0 moves UP to (2, 4) (D=4 to (5, 2)).\n        *   If #0 moves DOWN to (2, 2) (D=5 to (5, 2)).\n        *   #0 cannot reach (5, 2) this turn. **Safe to move UP and eat.**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 0):**\n    *   **Collision Check:** (5, 0) has an apple. Safe from immediate physical collision with my own body or walls.\n    *   **Battle Check:** Is Snake #0 targeting (5, 0)?\n        *   #0 is at (2, 3). Distance to (5, 0) is |5-2| + |0-3| = 3 + 3 = 6.\n        *   #0 cannot reach (5, 0) this turn. **Safe to move DOWN and eat.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 1):**\n    *   Collision: Safe (empty). Moves away from immediate apples.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 1):**\n    *   Collision: Moves onto my body segment (6, 1). **FATAL (Moving backwards).** (Note: Since I ate an apple at T23, the tail (7, 5) remains locked for one extra turn. My body includes (6, 1)).\n\n**Analysis of UP vs DOWN:**\n\nBoth UP and DOWN result in eating an apple and gaining a point, bringing me tied with Snake #0.\n\n*   If I move UP to (5, 2): The next remaining central apple is (5, 0). I will be 2 steps away (DOWN to (5, 1), then DOWN to (5, 0)).\n*   If I move DOWN to (5, 0): The next remaining central apple is (5, 2). I will be 2 steps away (UP to (5, 1), then UP to (5, 2)).\n\nHowever, we need to consider where Snake #0 is likely going. Snake #0 at (2, 3) has potential routes:\n1.  RIGHT to (3, 3): Targets central region or (7, 3) (D=3 to (7, 3), D=4 to (5, 0)).\n2.  DOWN to (2, 2): Targets lower left (0, 1) (D=4).\n3.  LEFT to (1, 3): Targets lower left (0, 1) (D=3).\n4.  UP to (2, 4): Avoids its own body (2, 4) and moves towards (7, 6) (far). (Wait, (2, 4) is Snake #0's body, so UP is a fatal move for #0 if it hasn't trailed yet. But since #0 is length 8, its tail is at (4, 8) and (2, 3) is its head, *and it hasn't just eaten an apple* - its body is [(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), ...]. Moving UP to (2, 4) IS FATAL for #0. So #0 must move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.)\n\n**Scenario 1: I move UP to (5, 2).** (Apple eaten, new head (5, 2), body contracts slightly, tail might be gone).\n*   If #0 moves RIGHT to (3, 3): #0 is now 4 steps from (5, 0).\n*   If #0 moves LEFT to (1, 3): #0 is 6 steps from (5, 0).\n*   If #0 moves DOWN to (2, 2): #0 is 5 steps from (5, 0).\n\n**Scenario 2: I move DOWN to (5, 0).** (Apple eaten, new head (5, 0)).\n*   If #0 moves RIGHT to (3, 3): #0 is 4 steps from (5, 2).\n*   If #0 moves LEFT to (1, 3): #0 is 6 steps from (5, 2).\n*   If #0 moves DOWN to (2, 2): #0 is 5 steps from (5, 2).\n\nSince the distances to the remaining central apple are the same (2 steps away for me, 4-6 steps away for Snake #0), and there is no immediate collision risk whether I move UP or DOWN, I should pick the move that minimizes exposure to the wall or enemy snake lines later.\n\n(5, 2) is a more central temporary position than (5, 0). Moving UP keeps me further away from the bottom wall and potentially allows smoother movement towards (7, 3) or (7, 6) later if the lower center is clogged by the enemy (though not currently).\n\nLet's prioritize getting (5, 2) first, as it is slightly further away from Snake #0's current path if they target (0, 1). If I take (5, 0), I am leaving (5, 2) wide open for #0 to approach via a rightward movement (e.g., (3, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (5, 2)). If I take (5, 2), then #0, moving R (3, 3), is slightly closer to (7, 3), which might divert them away from the remaining (5, 0).\n\nThe choice is highly symmetric, but taking the UP path seems slightly more strategically versatile for future moves towards the right side of the board where other apples (7, 3) and (7, 6) are located.\n\n**Collision Check Final Recapitulation:**\nMove UP to (5, 2). Head moves to (5, 2). Snake #0 cannot reach (5, 2). Safe.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T25 onward):**\nT25: Target the remaining central apple (5, 0). I will be at (5, 2). Move DOWN to (5, 1), then DOWN to (5, 0) on T26. If (5, 0) is suddenly contested, evaluate routes to (7, 3).\n\nUP",

SAFE.\n    *   **Strategic:** Moves me away from (5, 0).\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 1):**\n    *   **Collision Check:** (5, 1) is currently the segment right behind my head. Since I just ate at T24, my tail (7, 5) is retained, meaning my body segment (5, 1) *will not* vacate this turn.\n    *   Moving onto (5, 1) is moving into my own body. **FATAL**.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 2):**\n    *   **Collision Check:** (4, 2) is empty. SAFE.\n    *   **Strategic:** Moves towards the center left, potentially setting up for (0, 1), but that apple is further, and #0 is closer to it.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 2):**\n    *   **Collision Check:** (6, 2) is currently a body segment of Snake 1. Since my tail (7, 5) is retained, this segment **will not** vacate this turn.\n    *   Moving onto (6, 2) is moving into my own body. **FATAL**.\n\n**Crucial Realization: My body is static this turn due to eating an apple last turn.**\nBody segments: (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (7, 5).\n\n*   DOWN (5, 1): Self-collision. FATAL.\n*   RIGHT (6, 2): Self-collision. FATAL.\n*   Moving backwards (DOWN) is always fatal when the tail is retained, and usually fatal unless the tail is guaranteed to move AND the segment behind the head is the old tail position. Here, (5, 1) is definitely a body segment and not the tail position (7, 5).\n\nMy only safe moves are UP to (5, 3) and LEFT to (4, 2).\n\n**Analyzing Safe Moves (UP vs. LEFT):**\n\n**Goal:** Secure (5, 0) or move towards (7, 3).\n\n*   **Move UP to (5, 3):**\n    *   Position: (5, 3). Distance 3 to (5, 0). (5, 3) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 0).\n    *   This is a strong central position, keeping me mobilized. It pressures (7, 3) (D=4) and keeps options open for (7, 6).\n*   **Move LEFT to (4, 2):**\n    *   Position: (4, 2). Distance 3 to (5, 0). (4, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 0).\n    *   This also keeps me near the center, but potentially clutters the path if I want to go to the right side (where (7, 3) and (7, 6) are).\n\n**Predicted Enemy #0 Move (Head at (1, 3)):**\n#0 must avoid (2, 3) (backward), (2, 4) (body segment, retained tail), (1, 4) (which is empty).\n#0's body segments are (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8).\nSafe moves for #0: LEFT (0, 3), DOWN (1, 2), UP (1, 4) (empty), RIGHT (2, 3) (FATAL, body segment behind head). Wait, (2, 3) is behind the head (1, 3). Moving RIGHT to (2, 3) is fatal.\n\nSnake #0 safe directions: LEFT (0, 3), DOWN (1, 2), UP (1, 4).\nSnake #0 will most likely target apple (0, 1).\n*   LEFT to (0, 3): D=2 to (0, 1).\n*   DOWN to (1, 2): D=2 to (0, 1) (if it moves LEFT next).\n*   UP to (1, 4): Moves away from (0, 1).\n\nIf #0 moves LEFT to (0, 3) or DOWN to (1, 2), they are committed to the lower-left corner. This might leave (5, 0) uncontested.\n\n**Decision: Moving UP to (5, 3).**\nI need to maintain a path towards (5, 0) quickly before #0 comes back, but more importantly, I need a safe, general move. Moving UP to (5, 3) gets me closer to the upper, less contested apples (7, 6) and (2, 8), and keeps me centrally located for a clean sweep back down to (5, 0) on T26 and T27.\n\nIf I move UP to (5, 3):\nT26 plan: Move DOWN to (5, 2). Body at (5, 2) will vacate since the tail (7, 5) moves off (assuming no apple eaten this turn). This is safe. If I move (5, 2) to (5, 1), it is safe.\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 2):\nT26 plan: Move RIGHT to (5, 2). Body at (5, 2) will vacate. Safe.\n\nBoth moves keep the next move safe. UP seems slightly better as it positions me to pivot toward the cluster of apples on the right (7, 3) and (7, 6) if (5, 0) proves too slow or contested. Also, moving UP gives me more space vertically.\n\nI chose UP.\n\n---\n**Long-Term Plan (T26 onward):**\nT26: Snake 1 will be at (5, 3). Since I did not eat at T25, my tail (7, 5) will vacate, meaning (5, 1), (6, 2) etc., vacate. I will move DOWN to (5, 2), and then DOWN to (5, 1) on T27 (if safe) to approach (5, 0). If (5, 0) is taken or contested, I will aim for (7, 3), moving RIGHT/DOWN. If Snake #0 moves into the lower left, (5, 0) should be mine.\n\nUP",

My immediate target remains the apple at (5, 0) or the close apple at (7, 3).\n\n**My body segments (pre-move):** (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5).\n(6, 5) moves off, (5, 2) moves off if I move away from it.\n\n**Safe Moves from (5, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 4):**\n    *   **Collision Check:** Empty. SAFE.\n    *   **Strategic:** Moves away from (5, 0) and (7, 3). Better for reaching (7, 6) or (2, 8).\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 2):**\n    *   **Collision Check:** (5, 2) is the segment directly behind my head. Since I did not eat last turn, (5, 2) will vacate as the body shifts. SAFE.\n    *   **Strategic:** Moves me towards (5, 0) (D=2).\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 3):**\n    *   **Collision Check:** Empty. SAFE.\n    *   **Strategic:** Neutral move. Keeps options open, slightly closer to (2, 8).\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 3):**\n    *   **Collision Check:** (6, 3) is part of my body. It will shift to (6, 4) if the segment (6, 4) moves to (6, 5), which moves off board. (6, 3) will be occupied by the body segment currently at (6, 2). FATAL (self-collision).\n\nMy safe moves are UP (5, 4), DOWN (5, 2), and LEFT (4, 3).\n\n**Enemy #0 Analysis (Head at (1, 2)):**\n#0 is targeting (0, 1).\nSafe moves for #0:\nBody segments: (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7). (3, 7) vacates.\n*   UP (1, 3): Directly backwards. FATAL.\n*   DOWN (1, 1): SAFE. 1 step closer to (0, 1).\n*   LEFT (0, 2): SAFE. 1 step closer to (0, 1).\n*   RIGHT (2, 2): SAFE. Moves away from (0, 1).\n\n#0 will most likely move LEFT to (0, 2) or DOWN to (1, 1) to get (0, 1).\nIf #0 moves LEFT to (0, 2), it eats at T27.\nIf #0 moves DOWN to (1, 1), it eats at T27 (by moving LEFT).\n\n**Choosing My Move:**\nI need to prioritize an apple. (5, 0) (D=2) and (7, 3) (D=3) are the closest.\n\n1.  **DOWN to (5, 2):**\n    *   Puts me on track for (5, 0).\n    *   T27 target: (5, 1) (empty, body segment vacates), then (5, 0) for T28.\n    *   If I move DOWN, I successfully pursue the closest apple that #0 is not actively pursuing.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (4, 3):**\n    *   Distance to (5, 0) is 3 steps minimum ((4, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 0)). Wait, that's 4 steps total. Manhattan Distance to (5, 0) is M=3.\n    *   (4, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 0) is wrong.\n    *   (4, 3) -> (5, 3). If I move LEFT, I would have to move RIGHT again, or down/right.\n    *   (4, 3) -> (4, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 1) -> (5, 0). Still slower than going straight DOWN.\n\n3.  **UP to (5, 4):**\n    *   Best for heading towards the upper right (7, 6) or (2, 8).\n    *   Distance to (7, 3) is 4 steps. (5, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (7, 4) -> (7, 3). (Wait, (6, 4) is body segment. Need to check if it vacates!).\n    *   Body segments that are *not* the tail end (6, 5) *will* occupy the position of the segment immediately following them.\n    *   Original Body: (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5).\n    *   If I move UP to (5, 4), the new body is (5, 3), (5, 2), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4). (6, 5) vacated.\n    *   (6, 4) is still occupied by new tail. So, (5, 4) -> (6, 4) is still blocked/dangerous for T27. Trying to reach (7, 3) from (5, 4) is complicated.\n\nDOWN (5, 2) seems like the clear best move as it directly progresses towards (5, 0), which ensures I get an apple in 2 turns while #0 is busy in the corner.\n\n**Final check for collisions on DOWN (5, 2):**\n*   My head moves to (5, 2).\n*   (5, 2) is currently self-body, but since the tail (6, 5) vacates, the body shifts, and (5, 2) becomes safe. (5, 3) is the new (5, 2), (5, 2) is the new (5, 1), etc.\n*   No wall collision.\n*   Enemy head collision: #0 is at (1, 2). No collision risk.\n\nDOWN is the safest and most optimal move.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T27 onward):**\nT27: I will move DOWN to (5, 1). This spot should be safe as (5, 1) is currently a body segment, and it will vacate as the tail (6, 4) shifts off.\nT28: Eat apple at (5, 0).\nOnce I secure (5, 0), I will likely pivot towards (7, 3) or (7, 6).\n\nDOWN",
