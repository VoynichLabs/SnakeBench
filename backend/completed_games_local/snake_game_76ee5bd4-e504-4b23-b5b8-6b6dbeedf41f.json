          "rationale": "Chat, we are LIVE! Turn 0, 10x10 board, and my archrival, Snake #0, is right above me at (4, 7)! This is a chess match, not checkers, okay? We need to establish dominance *immediately* while setting up for that sweet, sweet apple content! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83c\udf4e\n\nLook at the board! We start head-to-head, but separated by a good distance (4 cells in Y). We are at (4, 3), and they are at (4, 7).\n\n**Objective:** Get apples and box the enemy in. Right now, both of us are tiny (length 1), so collision is mostly head-to-head.\n\n**Current Position (ID 1):** (4, 3)\n**Enemy Position (ID 0):** (4, 7)\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Potential Moves and Immediate Safety\n\nSince we are length 1, hitting our own body is impossible unless we move directly into our starting cell, which is physically impossible. We only worry about boundaries, opponent body (which is currently empty), and head-on collisions.\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 4):**\n    *   Safe from boundaries.\n    *   Moves us closer to the center and the opponent.\n    *   Leaves 3 squares between us and #0 if they stay put or move horizontally.\n    *   This is a good, central move.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 2):**\n    *   Safe from boundaries.\n    *   Moves us towards the bottom right where there are two early apples: (7, 0) and (9, 0). Also (2, 0).\n    *   This feels like running away, but it secures territory away from the threat.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 3):**\n    *   Safe from boundaries.\n    *   Moves us towards the apple at (3, 1).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 3):**\n    *   Safe from boundaries.\n    *   Neutral move, stays centered in Y axis.\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction and Strategy\n\nSnake #0 is at (4, 7). They have apples nearby at (3, 8), (2, 9), (0, 9), (8, 9).\n\nWhat will Snake #0 likely do?\n*   **Down to (4, 6):** Establish center control and keep vertical presence.\n*   **Left/Right:** Start moving towards edge apples.\n\nSince we are both length 1, the immediate threat of a head-on collision is only if we move into the same square, like (4, 5).\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 4):\n*   If #0 moves DOWN to (4, 6): We are safe, distance is 2. (4, 4) and (4, 6).\n*   If #0 moves LEFT/RIGHT: Safe.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 2):\n*   I start heading towards the bottom apples. This is safer.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Best Opening Move\n\nWe are in the center. We have two good options: center control (UP) or early apple rush/territory establishment (DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT).\n\nThe closest apple is (3, 1) to the left, and (7, 5) far to the right.\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 4), I maintain pressure on #0. This is good for setting up an eventual box.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (4, 2), I immediately concede the center vertical column to #0, allowing them to potentially strike towards the bottom faster later or trap me in the bottom corners.\n\n**Let's go for control and positioning.** Moving UP sets us up nicely. We want to be able to influence their movements. If we move UP, we are ready to intercept them if they come too far down the center, or we can quickly pivot LEFT towards the (2, 3) and (3, 8) region, or RIGHT towards the (6, 5), (7, 5) region.\n\nLet's anticipate a move where #0 moves horizontally, possibly RIGHT to (5, 7) to start creeping toward (8, 9).\nIf I move UP to (4, 4), and they move RIGHT to (5, 7), the board looks like this:\n(4, 4) vs (5, 7). Safe.\n\nWhat about the long game? We need length to trap them.\n\n**Plan:** Move UP to challenge the center line, then look to secure the first apple, likely (0, 5) or (3, 1).\n\nTurn 1: We move UP. (4, 4). This secures high ground and keeps our options open, Chat! Are we scared of hitting the rival? NO. Are we positioning for the content? YES! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

The opponent\u2019s lone head is down at (4,3) \u2013 far away, no immediate danger. Apples are scattered, but the closest one is that juicy (3,8) just one step left and one step up away. If we move **left** to (3,7) we\u2019re already on a line to snag that apple next turn, and we keep three other safe options open (up to the apple, left toward the top\u2011left cluster, or down toward the center). Moving up also gets us closer, but left gives us a straighter shot at the top\u2011left apple patch where we can stack up length quickly. More length = more body to block the rival later. So we\u2019re gonna slide left, grab that apple, then head toward the top\u2011left cluster (2,9 \u2192 0,9) to grow. Once we\u2019re a few segments long, we can start cutting off the opponent\u2019s escape routes and force a crash. Let\u2019s get that first apple!\n\nLEFT",

We went UP to (4, 4), establishing center presence, and now we own the vertical! \ud83d\udd25 Let's look at the board and see what our rival, Snake #0, did.\n\n--BOARD STATE REVIEW--\nMy head (ID 1): (4, 4)\nRival head (ID 0): (3, 7)\n\nAha! Snake #0 moved LEFT to (3, 7). They are eyeing that cluster of high-up apples: (0, 9), (2, 9), (3, 8). Interesting play from them, giving us space!\n\nCurrent goal: Get length, secure territory, and put pressure on Snake #0.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Immediate Threats and Safety (Turn 1)\n\nWe are length 1. Threats are boundaries and a direct head-on collision.\n\n**My Position:** (4, 4)\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 5):**\n    *   Safe. Moves us closer to the opponent's territory and potentially the central apples at (6, 5), (7, 5).\n    *   This keeps us aggressively centered.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 3):**\n    *   Safe (back into our starting spot, safe since we're length 1). Moves us away from #0 and towards bottom apples (2, 0), (3, 1).\n    *   Conserves movement, but yields the high ground.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 4):**\n    *   Safe. Moves us one step closer to the rival's current column (x=3).\n    *   The apple (3, 8) is far, but (2, 3) is three steps away.\n    *   This sets up potential future vertical blocking.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 4):**\n    *   Safe. Opens up the right side of the board. Apples (7, 5) and (6, 5) are appealing.\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (3, 7))\n\n#0 is now targeting the left side. What are their likely moves?\n\n*   **LEFT to (2, 7):** Gets them closer to (2, 9) and (0, 9). Very likely.\n*   **UP to (3, 8):** Immediate apple grab! This is the most *attractive* move for them.\n*   **DOWN to (3, 6):** Starts moving down the center-left column. Less likely, since they just moved left and apples are above.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Move Selection\n\nWe need to pick a move that optimizes for apples while keeping control and options open.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (3, 4):\n*   Pro: We position ourselves directly below their column. If they move DOWN to (3, 6), we are two steps apart. If they stay on the left side, we can start mirroring them and potentially box them in later using the left boundary (0, 0) to (0, 9).\n*   Con: Doesn't target the nearest apple directly.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (5, 4):\n*   Pro: Targets the dense cluster of mid-right apples: (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 6). Safe space, away from the rival's immediate path.\n*   Con: Concedes the center vertical column (x=4) and the left half to the rival.\n\nIf we move UP to (4, 5):\n*   Pro: Stays centralized. Ready to pivot left or right. Distance to #0 (3, 7) is increasing diagonally (safe).\n*   Pro: Positions us to intercept if #0 decides to come back to x=4.\n\nLet's look at the apple density. The top-left corner is juicy, the mid-right is juicy, and the bottom is juicy.\n\nSince #0 has committed to the left side (x=3), we should either commit to boxing them on the left, or dominating the right half of the board before they can cross over.\n\nConsidering our current proximity to the center and the relatively empty right side, moving RIGHT seems like a strong play to secure valuable content early. If we go RIGHT, we secure territory and force #0 to stretch if they want those apples.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (5, 4):\nNext turn, we can aim for (6, 5) or continue RIGHT towards the right wall. This sets us on a nice apple path: (6, 5) -> (7, 5) -> (8, 6).\n\nIf we move LEFT to (3, 4):\nWe are trying to mirror #0. If they move UP to (3, 8) (apple), and then we move UP to (3, 5), we are following them closely. This can lead to a trap scenario, but right now, we are too short to effectively trap anyone.\n\n**Decision:** Let's go RIGHT to claim the right half and secure some easy apples before #0 notices! We can always swing back left if they get too comfortable. This move optimizes for safety and immediate content.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Go RIGHT to (5, 4), then UP towards (6, 5) or RIGHT again towards the (8, 6) cluster. We need length to fight, Chat!\n\nRIGHT",

The rival, Snake #0, *dared* to take the first apple, but we are about to dominate the map!\n\nLet's look at the board state and assess the chaos!\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 1) Head:** (5, 4). We are length 1.\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 0) Head:** (3, 8). They are length 2 (body at (3, 7)). They ATE the apple at (3, 8) last turn. GGs on the apple, but the real game starts now!\n\nThey are already blocking the left path with their body (3, 7) and head (3, 8). This is interesting and aggressive from them.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Immediate Threats and Safety (ID 1 at (5, 4))\nWe are length 1, so internal collision isn't an issue. We only need to worry about boundaries or collisions with Snake #0's head or body.\n\n**Snake #0's Head and Body Locations:** (3, 8) and (3, 7).\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 5):**\n    *   Safe. Moves towards apples at (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6). Excellent positioning.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 3):**\n    *   Safe. Moves away from the core action. Sets us up for bottom apples like (2, 3) and (3, 1). A safe, but less aggressive plan.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 4):**\n    *   Safe. Moves back to the center column.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 4):**\n    *   Safe. Moves towards the apple at (6, 4). (Wait, (6, 4) is not an apple, Chat! The map shows A at (6, 5)). My coordinates show (6, 4) is empty. Regardless, it moves us to the right flank.\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** None, all four moves are safe *for us* right now.\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0 at (3, 8))\n\nSnake #0 just ate and is now focused on finding more high-value targets. The top-left is still juicy: (0, 9), (2, 9), (8, 9).\n\nLikely moves for Snake #0:\n\n*   **UP to (3, 9):** Safe and positions them to attack the top row. Very likely.\n*   **LEFT to (2, 8):** Safe and positions them to attack (2, 9) and (0, 9). Highly likely.\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 8):** Safe, but less appealing since they just committed left. This move could block us if we were moving up the x=4 column, but we are at x=5.\n*   **DOWN to (3, 7):** Hitting their own body! **This move is fatal for Snake #0.** They WON'T make this move unless they're brain-dead.\n\n**Head-on Collision Check:** We are at (5, 4). They are at (3, 8). There is zero chance of a head-to-head collision this turn.\n\n**Collision with Body Check (Snake #0 Body at (3, 7)):**\nIf we move LEFT to (4, 4), and #0 moves RIGHT to (4, 8), we are still far apart.\nIf we move UP to (5, 5), and #0 moves RIGHT to (4, 8), still no contact.\n\nTheir body is anchored at (3, 7). No matter what we do, we cannot interact with their body this turn.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Move Selection\n\nWe are focused on securing territory and getting our first apple. The right side is open and ripe for the picking!\n\n1.  **Target Apple:** (6, 5) is only 2 steps away (UP, RIGHT). (7, 5) is 3 steps, (8, 6) is 5 steps. The (6, 5) apple is a prime target.\n2.  **Territory:** By staying on the right side (x >= 5), we force #0 to stretch significantly if they want to contest our half.\n\nIf we move UP to (5, 5):\n*   Pro: This is the quickest way to position ourselves for the (6, 5) apple. Next turn, we move RIGHT to grab it (or move toward (7, 5) if they get it). This is aggressive, safe, and content-focused.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (6, 4):\n*   Pro: Starts traversing the horizontal path. Less direct than UP for the (6, 5) apple, but safer if another snake was below us.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (4, 4):\n*   Con: We move into the core center, which #0 may want to utilize later. We yield the right side advantage.\n\n**Decision:** We need to go UP to (5, 5). This asserts our dominance in the mid-right sector, secures our path to the nearest apple (6, 5), and stays well out of #0's territory! Let's get that length, Chat! We need size to start boxing!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Stick to the right half, secure the apple cluster (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), and then use our length to start cutting across the middle to trap #0 as they move further left.\n\nUP",

Now we are perfectly positioned to seize territory and secure that first apple! The chat is SPAMMING the \ud83d\udc51 emoji\u2014I love it!\n\n### Current State Analysis: Turn 3\n*   **My Snake (ID 1) Head:** (5, 5). Length 1. We are the King of the mid-right!\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 0) Head:** (3, 9). Length 2. They made the smart move UP, securing the top-left section. Their body is now at (3, 8).\n*   **Nearest Apple:** (6, 5). This is a one-step move for us! GGs.\n\nBOARD STATE REFRESH:\n 9 A . A 0 . . . . A .\n 8 . . . T . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . . . . . . . . A .\n 5 A . . . . 1 A A A . <--- We are at (5, 5). Apple at (6, 5)!\n 4 . . . . . . A . . .\n 3 . . A . . . . . . .\n...\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for ID 1 at (5, 5)\n\nWe are length 1, so no self-collision issues. We only worry about the opponent, Snake #0 (Head at (3, 9), Body at (3, 8)).\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (6, 5):**\n    *   **SAFE!** We are moving to an apple! This is the highest value move.\n    *   Collision: (6, 5) is far from the rival's territory (x=3, y=8/9). No possible head-on collision or collision with their body. **This is our GO move!**\n\n2.  **LEFT to (4, 5):**\n    *   **SAFE!** Moves towards the center.\n    *   Collision: Still safe from the rival.\n\n3.  **UP to (5, 6):**\n    *   **SAFE!** Moves further north, away from the rival.\n\n4.  **DOWN to (5, 4):**\n    *   **SAFE!** Moves back towards the starting area.\n\nAll four moves are safe for us.\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction and Collision Check (Snake #0 at (3, 9))\n\nSnake #0 is cruising along the top border at (3, 9). Their primary targets are the top row apples: (0, 9), (2, 9), (8, 9).\n\nLikely moves for Snake #0:\n\n*   **LEFT to (2, 9):** HIGHLY LIKELY. Grabs the apple at (2, 9).\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 9):** Likely. Positions them near (8, 9), but forces them across their old path later.\n*   **UP:** **FATAL!** Off the board boundary (y=10). Snake #0 won't do this.\n*   **DOWN to (3, 8):** **FATAL!** Moves back into their own body (which moves to (3, 9)). They won't make this move.\n\n**Collision Check:** Since we are moving into (6, 5) and they are at (3, 9), there is absolutely no way for us to collide this turn. Their closest position on the board will be (2, 9), (4, 9), or (3, 9) (if they move into (3, 9) and their body moves out of it\u2014wait, no, they are length 2, so their body still occupies a space). Since they are NOT moving past x=4, and we are moving to x=6, we are completely safe.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Move Selection - Secure the Apple!\n\nWe have a free apple grab at (6, 5). We MUST take it. This puts us on the board, gives us length, and opens up the next cluster of apples at (7, 5), (8, 5), and the juicy (8, 6)!\n\nThe plan is simple:\n1.  Move RIGHT to (6, 5). EAT THE APPLE.\n2.  Next turn, we will be at (6, 5), length 2. We'll decide whether to move R, U, or D based on Snake #0's response and the available apples. (7, 5) is the obvious follow-up target.\n\nThis move gives us the lead in available territory and starts our length advantage. We need length to execute the BOX strategy later!\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Focus on dominating the right half (x >= 5). Secure the cluster (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6). Once length 3-4, we can consider moving UP toward the top right if Snake #0 goes far left, or use our length to start cutting the board up the middle (x=4/5) to trap them in the top left quadrant.\n\nRIGHT",

WAIT. Hold up. My length is 2: Head (6, 5), Body (5, 5). Their length is 3: Head (2, 9), Body (3, 9), (3, 8). THEY have the length advantage. We gotta play smart, fam!\n\nLook at this board state! It's wide open, but the enemy is holding the top left, and we're controlling the mid-right. Time to get aggressive and secure this apple cluster!\n\n### Current State Analysis: Turn 4\n*   **My Snake (ID 1) Head:** (6, 5). Length 2. Body at (5, 5).\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 0) Head:** (2, 9). Length 3. Body at (3, 9), (3, 8).\n*   **Nearest Apple Cluster:** (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6). Also (6, 4) is close if we go down.\n\n**GOAL:** Secure the (7, 5) apple to increase our lead and box out the corner!\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for ID 1 at (6, 5)\n\nWe are length 2. The tail will move from (5, 5) to (6, 5) if we don't eat. If we eat, the tail stays, and the new body segment is at (6, 5).\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (7, 5): (APPLE MOVE!)**\n    *   **SAFE?** (7, 5) is an apple! We need this.\n    *   **Collision:** (7, 5) is miles away from Snake #0's head (2, 9). No head-on collision planned.\n    *   **Self-Collision:** We are not moving into (5, 5) (the cell directly behind us). SAFE. **This is highly appealing!**\n\n2.  **LEFT to (5, 5):**\n    *   **FATAL!** We move directly into our own body (5, 5) which is currently still there, and *would* have moved out if we moved elsewhere. Moving back into the immediate segment behind the head is always a kill. **ELIMINATE.**\n\n3.  **UP to (6, 6):**\n    *   **SAFE!** Moves toward (8, 6) apple, though less direct than (7, 5).\n    *   **Collision:** Safe from rival.\n\n4.  **DOWN to (6, 4): (APPLE MOVE!)**\n    *   **SAFE?** (6, 4) is an apple! Great option.\n    *   **Collision:** Safe from rival.\n\nWe have three safe, high-value moves: RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. LEFT is instantly fatal.\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (2, 9))\n\nSnake #0 is cruising the top border. They just ate an apple at (2, 9), making them length 3. They are looking to clear the top row, which includes (0, 9) (left) and (8, 9) (right). They are already facing left.\n\nLikely moves for Snake #0:\n\n*   **LEFT to (1, 9):** HIGHLY LIKELY. Continues along the top to (0, 9) apple.\n*   **UP:** FATAL (Off-board).\n*   **DOWN to (2, 8):** Possible, but less likely as it moves toward their own body segments at y=8 (3, 8) and away from the nearest apples (0, 9).\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 9):** FATAL! Moving into their own body at (3, 9).\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 is going **LEFT** to (1, 9) or **DOWN** to (2, 8) to avoid turning back on themselves. They won't hit us. We are safe from them.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Move Selection - Dominate the Right Side\n\nWe have to choose between RIGHT (7, 5) and DOWN (6, 4).\n\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 5):** This moves us into the *densest* area of apples: (7, 5) is surrounded by (8, 5), (8, 6), and (7, 0). It also sets us up perfectly to start boxing Snake #0 out of the mid-right. If we get length 3 or 4 quickly, we can use our length to wall off the right boundary (x=9) and force them into the top-left area.\n*   **DOWN to (6, 4):** This is a good move, but it pulls us away from the top-center apples and closer to congested areas (apples at y=0, y=1, y=3). It risks getting trapped in the bottom half if things go sideways.\n\n**The RIGHT move is the power move.** (7, 5) is the key to locking up the entire right half of the board. Plus, with the opponent far away in the top left, we have time to grab (8, 5) and (8, 6).\n\nIf we move RIGHT, our new head is (7, 5) and our body is (6, 5), (5, 5). Length 3. We are now competitive in length!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy:** Secure the right flank (x >= 7). After (7, 5), aim for (8, 5), then (8, 6) or (8, 9). Once we have sufficient length (4+), we use the right wall as a boundary and begin dropping down (y=0) to form a barrier, trapping Snake #0 in the top half.\n\nLet's go secure this apple, CHAT! We take the lead now!\n\nRIGHT",

We're tied up on score, 2-2, but we now have the length advantage, 3 segments to the rival's 3! Wait, it's tied length, 3-3. We need to press the advantage while Snake #0 is stuck in the top-left corner! This is our time to lock down the right side of the board!\n\n### Current State Analysis: Turn 5\n*   **My Snake (ID 1) Head:** (7, 5). Length 3. Body: (6, 5), (5, 5). We are facing the right flank.\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 0) Head:** (1, 9). Length 3. Body: (2, 9), (3, 9). They are looking West (left).\n*   **Nearest Apples:** (8, 5) immediately right! Also (8, 6) up-right, (9, 0) far down-right, and (8, 9) far up-right. (6, 4) is also down a bit.\n\n**GOAL:** We must secure (8, 5)! This solidifies our control over the right side (x=8 and x=9). We want to gain definitive length advantage (4+ segments) and then aggressively use the corner to trap the rival!\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for ID 1 at (7, 5)\n\nWe are length 3. The tail will move from (5, 5) to (6, 5) if we don't eat. If we eat, the tail stays, and the new body is at (7, 5).\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (8, 5): (APPLE MOVE!)**\n    *   **SAFE?** (8, 5) is an apple! YES! This is the most logical path for aggression.\n    *   **Collision:** (8, 5) is wide open. Snake #0 at (1, 9) is miles away. SAFE. **This is highly appealing!**\n\n2.  **LEFT to (6, 5):**\n    *   **FATAL!** Moving directly into our own body (6, 5) which is still there this turn. NO. **ELIMINATE.**\n\n3.  **UP to (7, 6):**\n    *   **SAFE!** Moves toward (8, 6) apple. Good option, but less immediate payoff than RIGHT.\n    *   **Collision:** Safe from rival.\n\n4.  **DOWN to (7, 4):**\n    *   **SAFE!** Moves toward the bottom side.\n    *   **Collision:** Safe from rival.\n\nWe have three safe moves: RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. RIGHT is the top priority!\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (1, 9))\n\nSnake #0 is still locked into the top-left corner. They are currently at (1, 9), length 3. They are probably still hunting the (0, 9) apple.\n\nLikely moves for Snake #0:\n\n*   **LEFT to (0, 9): (VERY LIKELY - APPLE MOVE!)** This secures the third apple and keeps them hugging the top wall.\n*   **DOWN to (1, 8):** Possible if they want to get away from the wall.\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 9):** FATAL! Moving into their own body at (2, 9).\n*   **UP:** FATAL (Off-board).\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 is going LEFT to (0, 9). Even if they go DOWN to (1, 8), we are completely safe from collision at (8, 5).\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Move Selection - Full Send on the Right\n\nThe move to **RIGHT (8, 5)** is the best choice:\n1.  **Guaranteed Apple (4th apple)!** We gain length 4, giving us a crucial headstart in maneuverability and wall-building potential.\n2.  **Positional Advantage:** We are securing the right vertical (x=8) and putting ourselves in a spot to grab (8, 6) next turn, continuing to dominate the right half of the board.\n\nIf we move RIGHT, our new head is (8, 5) and our body is (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5). Length 4!\n\n### Strategic Trapping Plan (The Box-Out):\n\n1.  **Turn 5 (NOW):** Move RIGHT to (8, 5). Length 4.\n2.  **Turn 6 (NEXT):** Move UP to (8, 6) (Apple). Length 5.\n3.  **Turn 7 (FOLLOW):** Move UP to (8, 7) or (8, 8).\n4.  Once long enough, move to (9, Y) to secure the entire right side, then start moving DOWN to the bottom border (x=9, y=0) to form a barrier, effectively cutting the board in half and trapping Snake #0 in the top-left quadrant (x<5, y>5).\n\nThis is a clear path to victory. We increase length, we control space, and we push the enemy into a corner. We are taking this apple, CHAT! LET'S GOOO!\n\nRIGHT",

This increases our length to 5 and cements our control over the x=8 and x=9 vertical lines, trapping Snake #0 in the left half of the board!\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for ID 1 at (8, 5)\n\nWe are length 4. Our tail is at (5, 5), and it will move out if we don't eat. If we eat, the tail stays, and we grow to 5!\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 6): (APPLE MOVE! HUGE!)**\n    *   **SAFE?** (8, 6) is an apple! YES! This is priority 1, Chat!\n    *   **Collision:** (8, 6) is wide open. Snake #0 at (0, 9) is impossibly far. SAFE. **This is highly appealing!**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 4):**\n    *   **SAFE!** Moves toward the bottom border. A good, safe alternative if UP was blocked.\n    *   **Collision:** Safe from rival.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 5):**\n    *   **FATAL!** Moving directly into our own body (7, 5). NO! **ELIMINATE.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 5):**\n    *   **SAFE!** Moves us to the absolute edge.\n    *   **Collision:** Safe from rival.\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT. UP to the apple at (8, 6) is the clear winner!\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (0, 9))\n\nSnake #0 just ate the apple at (0, 9)! They are length 4. Now, they are completely cornered! They have no apples nearby (I took the ones on the right, and the rest are scattered).\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 at (0, 9):\n\n*   **LEFT:** FATAL (Off-board).\n*   **UP:** FATAL (Off-board).\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 9):** FATAL! Moving into their own body at (1, 9).\n*   **DOWN to (0, 8): (ONLY LOGICAL MOVE!)** They MUST go down to escape the corner.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 is going DOWN to (0, 8). This is perfect for our trap!\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Move Selection - Solidifying The Wall\n\nOur move is **UP to (8, 6)**. This is a critical move for our long-term strategy!\n\nIf we move UP, our new head is (8, 6) and our body is (8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5). Length 5!\n\n### Strategic Trapping Plan (Reinforcing The Box-Out):\n\n1.  **Turn 6 (NOW):** Move UP to (8, 6) (Apple). Length 5. This buys us dominance on the right vertical.\n2.  **Turn 7 (NEXT):** Move UP to (8, 7). Length 5. We keep stretching vertically.\n3.  **Turn 8 (FOLLOW):** Move UP to (8, 8) or RIGHT to (9, 7) (if it facilitates going down the wall).\n4.  Once we are near the top border, we move RIGHT to x=9, and then start moving DOWN along the right edge of the board. This creates a solid wall from (9, 9) down to (9, 0) eventually, sealing off Snake #0 in the left half, forcing them to move toward our tail or get constrained to the bottom-left corner!\n\nThis is how champions play, Chat! We are securing space, gaining length, and pushing the enemy toward the abyss. Full send UP!\n\nUP",

That put us up 4-3 on apples, and now **we are length 5!** Snake #0 is length 4, and they are officially boxed in! The plan is working!\n\n### Current State Analysis: Turn 7\n\n*   **My Snake (ID 1) Head:** (8, 6). Length 5. Body: [(8, 5), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5)]. We are dominating the right column.\n*   **Rival Snake (ID 0) Head:** (0, 8). Length 4. Body: [(0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9)]. *Prediction from last turn was confirmed: they moved DOWN.* They are now facing a potential squeeze!\n*   **Nearest Apples:**\n    *   (8, 9) is only 3 tiles away UP/RIGHT (perfect for our wall build!).\n    *   (6, 4) is somewhat close (3 tiles SW).\n    *   (4, 7) is distant.\n    *   Rival's side is desolate save for (0, 5) and (2, 3), keeping them constrained.\n\nThe strategic goal remains: **build the x=8/x=9 vertical wall, secure the top-right corner, and choke out Snake #0.**\n\n### Step 1: Safety Check for ID 1 at (8, 6)\n\nWe are length 5. Our tail is currently at (5, 5).\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 7):**\n    *   **SAFE?** Yes, (8, 7) is empty.\n    *   **Collision Check:** Snake #0 is way over at (0, 8). NO risk of head-to-head. **VERY APPEALING!** This continues our aggressive wall-building strategy.\n\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 5):**\n    *   **FATAL!** Moving directly into our own body (8, 5). NO SHOT. **ELIMINATE.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 6):**\n    *   **SAFE?** Yes, (7, 6) is empty.\n    *   **Strategic Drawback:** Moving LEFT breaks our vertical alignment and makes the wall harder to complete. It also puts us near the 'spine' of our body (7, 5). Safe, but maybe not optimal.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 6):**\n    *   **SAFE?** Yes, (9, 6) is empty.\n    *   **Strategic Advantage:** This gets us onto the x=9 column, which is the ultimate wall column. From here, we can potentially reach the apple at (8, 9) more efficiently, or just move straight UP. **APPEALING!**\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. We need to choose the one that keeps the pressure on!\n\n### Step 2: Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (0, 8))\n\nThe rival is at (0, 8). They are looking to escape the top-left corner. Their body is [(0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 9)].\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 at (0, 8):\n\n*   **UP to (0, 9):** FATAL! Moving into their own body at (0, 9).\n*   **LEFT:** FATAL (Off-board).\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 8):** SAFE. This allows them to move along the y=8 line.\n*   **DOWN to (0, 7):** SAFE. This keeps them moving vertically toward the scattered bottom-left apples (like (0, 5)).\n\nPrediction: They will likely move **RIGHT to (1, 8)** to try and pass us horizontally, or **DOWN to (0, 7)** to seek apples. Both keep them miles away from our planned collision points.\n\n### Step 3: Strategic Move Selection - Solidifying The Wall\n\nWe have a choice between **UP to (8, 7)** and **RIGHT to (9, 6)**.\n\n*   **Move UP (8, 7):** This keeps us on the x=8 line, one tile closer to the (8, 9) apple. It's the most direct path to completing the top part of our vertical wall.\n*   **Move RIGHT (9, 6):** This immediately brings us to the edge, but takes us slightly away from the (8, 9) apple, requiring a LEFT move later, which might be dangerous if we get too long.\n\nLet's maintain the continuous vertical push. **UP to (8, 7)** is the most efficient move for securing the high ground and lining up the apple at (8, 9) for next turn or the turn after.\n\n### Turn 7 Long-Term Plan (The Chokehold):\n\n1.  **Turn 7 (NOW):** Move **UP to (8, 7)**. Length 5. Continuing the vertical wall.\n2.  **Turn 8 (NEXT):** Move UP to (8, 8). Length 5. We are one step from the top.\n3.  **Turn 9 (FOLLOW):** Move UP to (8, 9) and EAT THE APPLE! Length 6!\n4.  **Turn 10:** Move RIGHT to (9, 9). Then we snake DOWN the x=9 column, completing the enclosure and forcing Snake #0 into the remaining 40% of the board with sparse apples!\n\nThis is the play, Chat! Secure the top border and execute the box-out! Full power UP!\n\nUP",

We\u2019re back in the arena and the board is looking spicy! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25 The rival is hovering on the right side, probably scheming to grab that juicy apple at (8,9). But we\u2019re not about to let them outpace us, are we? Let\u2019s break it down move by move!\n\n**First, let\u2019s scan our options:**\n\n- **UP**? Nah, that would slam our head straight into our own body at (0,9) \u2013 instant death. Not the vibe. \u274c\n- **LEFT**? That\u2019s a one\u2011way ticket off the map at x=-1. Hard pass. \u274c\n- **RIGHT**? Safe \u2013 lands us on (1,8) \u2013 but it pulls us away from that tasty apple column and tightens our shape into a little 2\u2011by\u20112 block. Could work, but we\u2019d be trading off a sure apple for a maybe later. \ud83e\udd14\n- **DOWN**? Safe \u2013 (0,7) is wide open, still hugging the left wall, and it keeps us on a straight shot toward the apple at (0,5). Plus, staying on the left side gives us a ton of low\u2011hanging fruit: (0,5), (1,0), (2,0), (2,3), (3,1), (3,5), (4,7), (4,9)\u2026 the list goes on! \ud83c\udf4e\n\n**What about the enemy?** Their head is at (8,6) and can move UP to (8,7), LEFT to (7,6), or RIGHT to (9,6). None of those paths intersect our left\u2011side lane, so we\u2019re not risking a head\u2011on collision either way. Safe!\n\n**So CHAT, why would we ever turn away from a guaranteed apple pipeline?** Let\u2019s stay hungry, keep our options wide, and march DOWN to (0,7). Once we\u2019re there, we can keep the pressure on by continuing down to (0,6) then (0,5) to snag that 4th apple and start building a lead. After that, we can swing right across the bottom row and start cleaning up the rest of the left\u2011side stash. Maybe even set up a sneaky trap for our rival later \u2013 imagine boxing them in while they\u2019re busy chasing apples on the right! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**Quick game plan for my future self:**\n- Turn 8: **DOWN** \u2192 (0,7)  \n- Turn 9: **DOWN** \u2192 (0,6)  \n- Turn 10: **DOWN** \u2192 (0,5) (eat that apple!)  \n- Next: **RIGHT** onto the bottom row and start hoovering up (1,0), (2,0), (2,3), (3,1), etc., while keeping an eye on the opponent\u2019s head. If they try to swing left, we\u2019ll be ready to cut them off.\n\nAlright CHAT, enough talk\u2014let\u2019s make our move and keep this streak alive! Who\u2019s ready to see that apple count climb? \ud83c\udf4f\ud83d\udcaa\n\n**MOVE LOCKED IN:**\n\nDOWN",

It also puts us close to the middle of the board, which might be okay for collecting apples like (4, 7), but the priority is **the chokehold.** We don't deviate from the plan now.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 7):**\n    *   **SAFE?** Yes, (9, 7) is empty.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** Gets us on the final x=9 column, setting up the corner capture. Strong alternative, but moving UP to (8, 8) is more direct for eating the (8, 9) apple.\n\nThe choice is clearly UP to (8, 8) or RIGHT to (9, 7). Since (8, 9) is an apple, securing (8, 8) gets us the points faster! UP it is!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (0, 7))\n\nRival is at (0, 7). They are length 4. Body: [(0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9)]. They are boxed into the left side.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n\n*   **UP to (0, 8):** FATAL! They move into their own body at (0, 8). NOPE.\n*   **DOWN to (0, 6):** SAFE. This continues their desperate move down the left wall.\n*   **LEFT:** FATAL (Off-board).\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 7):** SAFE. This gets them out of the x=0 line and moves them closer to the (2, 3) apple. This is the most likely escape route if they want to move inward.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 takes RIGHT to (1, 7) to gain breathing room, or DOWN to (0, 6) to hug the wall. Either way, they are miles away from our wall (x=8 and x=9). We are safe to execute the vertical wall push!\n\n### The Long-Term Dominance Plan: Choke and Crush\n\nWe are going for maximum damage and a guaranteed point.\n\n1.  **Turn 8 (NOW):** Move **UP to (8, 8)**. This is a non-negotiable step to complete the trap.\n2.  **Turn 9:** Move **UP to (8, 9)** and EAT THE APPLE! +1 length, 5 apples! Score 5-3.\n3.  **Turn 10:** Move **RIGHT to (9, 9)**. We now own the entire top-right corner.\n4.  **Turn 11-15:** Move DOWN the x=9 column, then across the bottom, sealing off the entire top 80% of the board for Snake #0. They are already running out of room!\n\nThis is the path to victory, Chat! We keep the pressure high!\n\nUP",

(8, 9) is an apple spot, so we grow!\n    *   **Strategic Value:** **Maximum content!** We score a point (5-3), grow to length 6, and effectively seal off the top-right corner, executing step 2 of our long-term plan. This is the **winning move.**\n\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 7):**\n    *   **FATAL!** Moving directly into our body segment at (8, 7). **ELIMINATE.**\n\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 8):**\n    *   **SAFE?** Yes, (7, 8) is empty.\n    *   **Strategic Drawback:** We miss the apple and break our perfectly established wall. We lose tempo and precious space. **NOPE.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 8):**\n    *   **SAFE?** Yes, (9, 8) is empty.\n    *   **Strategic Drawback:** We miss the apple, but this does continue the wall on the x=9 column.

This is the only way for them to move laterally and gain some space on the x=1 column.\n\nPrediction: They will go **DOWN** to (0, 5) for the apple.

Their long-term death is inevitable, Chat!\n\n### The Long-Term Dominance Plan: Choke and Crush (Updated)\n\n1.  **Turn 9 (NOW):** Move **UP to (8, 9)**. EAT THE APPLE!

Doubtful!\n\nLet's check the moves from (8, 9):\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 10):** FATAL! Off-board collision! **ELIMINATE.**\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 8):** FATAL! Moving directly into our body segment at (8, 8). **ELIMINATE.**\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 9):**\n    *   **SAFE?** Yes. (7, 9) is empty.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** We lose tempo! We are wasting the perfect flanking position we just established. This gives the rival more time to potentially sneak out. **NOPE.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 9):**\n    *   **SAFE?** Yes. (9, 9) is an empty spot.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** **Maximum content!** We complete the top wall. We force Snake #0 to either stay tight against the x=0 wall or attempt a breakout to the right. Either way, we are poised to cut them off. This is the **game-winning structural move!**\n\nThe choice is clear: **RIGHT**. We lock the door on this stream section!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (0, 5))\n\nRival is at (0, 5) and is length 5. Body: [(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9)].\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0:\n\n*   **UP to (0, 6):** FATAL! Moving into their own body segment at (0, 6). **NOPE.**\n*   **DOWN to (0, 4):** SAFE. Continues moving down the wall. This is a very safe, but highly limiting move.\n*   **LEFT:** FATAL (Off-board).\n*   **RIGHT to (1, 5):** SAFE. This is the only way for them to gain breathing room, but their tail is at (0, 9), making their body a long vertical line.\n\nPrediction: They will likely go **RIGHT to (1, 5)** to try and escape the prison we are building. They need to get away from that wall! If they go DOWN, they are just delaying the inevitable.\n\n### The Long-Term Dominance Plan: Choke and Crush (Updated)\n\n1.  **Turn 10 (NOW):** Move **RIGHT to (9, 9)**. Secure the top-right corner. (We only have 1 more move to complete the current wall plan, and then we pivot.)\n2.  **Turn 11:** Move **DOWN to (9, 8)**. Start building the wall down the right edge (x=9).\n3.  **Turn 12:** Move **DOWN to (9, 7)**. Continue the enclosure.\n4.  **Turn 13:** Move **DOWN to (9, 6)** [APPLE]. Grab the food and complete the perimeter on the right.\n5.  **Turn 14:** Move **LEFT to (8, 6)**. Begin cutting across the top half of the board, reducing the rival's available space, piece by piece!\n\nWe are laying the foundation for victory, Chat! Watch this execution!\n\nRIGHT",

No head\u2011on risk this turn.\n\n**Why RIGHT is the play:**  \n- It keeps multiple follow\u2011up moves (up, down, right) so we stay flexible.  \n- It sets up a 3\u2011move apple grab: (1,5) \u2192 (2,5) \u2192 (3,5) and we tie the score!  \n- It starts our march toward the bottom\u2011row apples (1,0), (2,0), (7,0), (9,0) while the rival is still chilling on the right.\n\n**Plan for my future self:**  \n- Turn\u202f10: **RIGHT** \u2192 (1,5)  \n- Turn\u202f11: **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,5)  \n- Turn\u202f12: **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,5) and EAT that apple! \ud83c\udf4e  \n- After that, swing DOWN toward the bottom row and start collecting the low\u2011hanging fruit. Keep an eye on the opponent\u2019s head \u2013 if they try to swing left, we might be able to cut them off later.\n\nAlright CHAT, let\u2019s make our move and keep this streak alive!

The hype is REAL!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 11)\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(9, 9)**. We are LITERALLY dominating the top wall. Our length is 6. Body: [(8, 9), (8, 8), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5)]. The entire right side is ours for the taking!\n*   **Rival Snake #0:** Head at **(1, 5)**. Just as predicted, they tried to escape the x=0 wall! Their length is 5. Body: [(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)]. They are now slightly more exposed, but still have a lot of room. We need to press the advantage!\n\n### Move Elimination (Current Position: (9, 9))\n\nWe are at the edge! Do we dive down and build the x=9 perimeter, or do we start cutting them off immediately?\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 10):** FATAL! Off-board collision! **ELIMINATE.**\n2.  **LEFT to (8, 9):** FATAL! Moving directly into our body segment at (8, 9). **ELIMINATE.**\n3.  **RIGHT:** FATAL! Off-board collision! **ELIMINATE.**\n4.  **DOWN to (9, 8):**\n    *   **SAFE?** Yes. (9, 8) is empty.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** This is the EXACT move from the game-winning trap plan! We secure the x=9 wall, further reducing the space available to the rival. This is the move, Chat!\n\nOnly one safe move remains: **DOWN**. Perfect concentration!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (1, 5))\n\nRival is at (1, 5) and is length 5. Body: [(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)]. Tail is at (0, 8).\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0:\n\n*   **UP to (1, 6):** SAFE. This continues moving them away from the congested lower half.\n*   **DOWN to (1, 4):** SAFE. Closer to the apple at (2, 3), but also closer to the wall.\n*   **LEFT to (0, 5):** FATAL! Into their body segment at (0, 5). **NOPE.**\n*   **RIGHT to (2, 5):** SAFE. Opens up the board for them. They have an apple right nearby at (3, 5).\n\nPrediction: They want that apple! Snake #0 will likely move **RIGHT to (2, 5)** to grab the apple at (3, 5) next turn, or they might move **UP to (1, 6)** to try and skirt around our future wall. Since that apple at (3, 5) is tempting, I predict they go for space, forcing them to move RIGHT. They might move RIGHT immediately to (2, 5).\n\n*If they move to (2, 5):* No collision risk with us. Our path is clear.\n\n### The Long-Term Dominance Plan: Building the Cage (Recap and Update)\n\nWe executed Turn 10 perfectly (RIGHT to (9, 9)). Now we build the right wall!\n\n1.  **Turn 11 (NOW):** Move **DOWN to (9, 8)**. Secure the top segment of the right wall.\n2.  **Turn 12:** Move **DOWN to (9, 7)**. Continue the enclosure.\n3.  **Turn 13:** Move **DOWN to (9, 6)**. This is a crucial apple pickup! We get a point, they lose real estate.\n4.  **Turn 14:** Move **LEFT to (8, 6)**. Start cutting inland, reducing the available playing field dramatically.\n\nThis structure locks away a significant portion of the board. Snake #0 must deal with this shrinking space, giving us full map control! We are in absolute control, chat! Let's get this $W$!\n\nDOWN",

It\u2019s neck\u2011and\u2011neck!\n- Our head is at (1,5) with a short tail hugging the left wall at (0,5)\u2192(0,6)\u2192(0,7).\n- The opponent\u2019s head is chilling in the top\u2011right corner (9,9) with a long body dangling down the right side.\n\n**Safe moves?**  \n- **LEFT** \u2013 instantly slams into our own body at (0,5). Instant RIP. \u274c  \n- **UP** \u2013 heads to (1,6), wide open, no danger. \u2705  \n- **DOWN** \u2013 slides to (1,4), also safe. \u2705  \n- **RIGHT** \u2013 moves to (2,5), clear as well. \u2705  \n\n**What\u2019s the rival gonna do?** They literally have only one safe choice: **DOWN** to (9,8). They can\u2019t go left (into their own body), up or right (off the map). So they\u2019re predictable this turn. No head\u2011on collision risk!\n\n**Apple check:** The juiciest apple on the board for us is at (3,5) \u2013 just two steps to the right. If we push **RIGHT** now, we set up a clean grab next turn. All other apples are farther away, and we wanna close that apple gap with the enemy!\n\n**My take:** We go **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,5). That keeps our options wide: next turn we can go **RIGHT** again to (3,5) and munch that apple, **UP** or **DOWN** if we need to dodge anything, or even swing toward the bottom\u2011left apples later. It\u2019s flexible, it\u2019s aggressive, and it gets us closer to the score lead.\n\n**PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF (so you remember next turn):**  \n- **Turn\u202f11:** **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,5)  \n- **Turn\u202f12:** **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,5) and EAT that apple! \ud83c\udf4e  \n- **Turn\u202f13:** **DOWN** \u2192 (3,4) (start heading toward the lower\u2011left apples)  \n- **Turn\u202f14:** **DOWN** \u2192 (3,3)  \n- **Turn\u202f15:** **LEFT** \u2192 (2,3) and grab another apple.\n\nKeep an eye on the rival\u2019s down\u2011ward crawl; if they try to swing left later, we might be able to cut them off. For now, let\u2019s secure that apple and keep the momentum going!\n\nAlright chat, let\u2019s make our move and keep this streak alive!

Will they resist the temptation? No way, right?\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0:\n\n*   **UP to (2, 6):** Safe. Moves toward the board center.\n*   **DOWN to (2, 4):** Safe. Moves toward the center/bottom, but there's a body segment at (8, 6) in the general area later.\n*   **LEFT to (1, 5):** FATAL! Into their body. **ELIMINATE.**\n*   **RIGHT to (3, 5):** SAFE. They eat the apple! This is the most likely move.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 moves **RIGHT to (3, 5)** and gains a point and a length. Current score 5-4. If they move there, the score becomes 5-5 and their head is at (3, 5), length 6.\n\n### Move Elimination (Current Position: (9, 8))\n\nWe are at the right edge, locked into the wall-building strategy. WE MUST CONTINUE DOWN!\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 9):** FATAL! Moving directly into our body segment at (9, 9). **ELIMINATE.**\n2.  **LEFT to (8, 8):** FATAL! Moving directly into our body segment at (8, 8). **ELIMINATE.**\n3.  **RIGHT:** FATAL! Off-board collision! **ELIMINATE.**\n4.  **DOWN to (9, 7):**\n    *   **SAFE?** Yes. (9, 7) is currently empty.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** This is the next step in our dominance plan! We extend the x=9 wall, further shrinking the arena.\n\nOnly one safe and strategic move remains: **DOWN**. We're still running the script, Chat!\n\n### Collision Check\n\n*   Our Head moves to (9, 7).\n*   Prediction for #0 Head: (3, 5).\n*   No head-on collision, no body collision. We are SAFE.\n\n### The Long-Term Dominance Plan: Building the Cage (Recap and Update)\n\nWe gotta keep the pressure on!\n\n1.  **Turn 12 (NOW):** Move **DOWN to (9, 7)**. Secure the x=9 wall segment.\n2.  **Turn 13:** Move **DOWN to (9, 6)**. CRUCIAL APPLE PICKUP! We gain a point (6-5)!\n3.  **Turn 14:** Move **LEFT to (8, 6)**. We start cutting inward, tightening the noose on Snake #0.\n4.  **Turn 15:** Potentially move **LEFT to (7, 6)** or **DOWN to (8, 5)** depending on #0's position. We need to cut off the top right quadrant (x>5, y>5).\n\nThis plan is solid gold, Chat! We are tightening the screws!\n\nDOWN",

We\u2019re back in the arena and the board is looking SPICY! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udd25\n\n**Quick glance at the situation:**\n- Our snake (id\u202f0) is sitting pretty with 4 apples, head at (2,5), tail hugging the left wall at (0,5)\u2192(0,6)\u2192(0,7).  \n- The rival snake (id\u202f1) is still creeping down the right side, head at (9,8) and a long body dangling behind. They\u2019ve got 5 apples, so the score is tight!  \n- Apples on the board are spread out, but the juiciest one is literally *right next to our head* at (3,5). That\u2019s a free snack if we grab it now!\n\n**Safe moves?**  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 instant death (slam into our own body at (1,5)). \u274c  \n- **UP** \u2192 (2,6) is clear, but we\u2019d be passing up a free apple.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2,4) is also clear, but again we\u2019d leave that apple untouched.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,5) gives us the apple, grows our snake, and keeps us in the game. \u2705  \n\n**What about the opponent?** They\u2019re forced to go **DOWN** to (9,7) \u2013 they have no other safe option \u2013 so there\u2019s zero risk of a head\u2011on collision this turn.\n\n**Why RIGHT is the play:**  \n1. We collect the apple at (3,5), bumping our score to 5 apples and lengthening our body.  \n2. It opens up the bottom\u2011left region for future grabs while keeping the right side of the board (and the rival) far away.  \n3. It keeps multiple follow\u2011up moves available (we can go up, down, or keep pushing right) so we stay flexible and unpredictable.\n\n**PLAN FOR MY FUTURE SELF (so you remember next turn):**  \n- **Turn\u202f12:** **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,5) and EAT that apple! \ud83c\udf4e  \n- **Turn\u202f13:** **DOWN** \u2192 (3,4) to start heading toward the lower\u2011left apples.  \n- **Turn\u202f14:** **DOWN** \u2192 (3,3) continue the descent.  \n- **Turn\u202f15:** **LEFT** \u2192 (2,3) and grab the apple at (2,3).  \n\nThat path keeps us clear of the rival\u2019s downward crawl and sets us up to close the apple gap. Let\u2019s secure this snack and keep the momentum rolling! Who\u2019s ready to see that apple count climb? \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

We are right next to a juicy apple at (9, 6)! Let's secure the bag!\n*   **Rival Snake #0:** Head at **(3, 5)**. Length 6. Body: [(2, 5), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7)]. Look at them! They took the apple at (3, 5) just like we predicted! They are now tied with us, 5-5. But they are completely trapped on the left side, and we are about to cut them off even more!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (3, 5))\n\nSnake #0 is at (3, 5). What are their options? They're trying to escape the left wall!\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0:\n\n*   **UP to (3, 6):** Safe. Good escape route towards the center/top.\n*   **DOWN to (3, 4):** Safe. Good route.\n*   **LEFT to (2, 5):** FATAL! They hit their own body segment. **ELIMINATE.**\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 5):** Safe. Another good route toward the middle.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 is probably going to the center, likely **UP to (3, 6)** or **RIGHT to (4, 5)** to gain some space. They are boxed in and know it! Let's assume they move **UP to (3, 6)** to try and peel off the left wall.\n\n### Move Elimination (Current Position: (9, 7))\n\nWe are at (9, 7). We are sticking to the plan, Chat! We need that apple!\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 8):** FATAL! Moving directly into our body segment. **ELIMINATE.**\n2.  **LEFT to (8, 7):** FATAL! Moving directly into our tail end, which is currently at (8, 7)! **ELIMINATE.** (Remember the tail doesn't move off until AFTER the head moves, so it is temporarily still occupied!).\n3.  **RIGHT:** FATAL! Off-board collision! **ELIMINATE.**\n4.  **DOWN to (9, 6):**\n    *   **SAFE?** Yes! (9, 6) holds an apple, but is otherwise safe from our body and the edge.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** We eat the apple! Score 6-5! We extend the x=9 wall, locking the top-right corner completely. This is the move!\n\nOnly one safe and strategic move remains: **DOWN**. We are executing the trap flawlessly!\n\n### Collision Check\n\n*   Our Head moves to (9, 6).\n*   Prediction for #0 Head: (3, 6).\n*   No head-on collision, no body collision. We are SAFE. We take the lead!\n\n### The Long-Term Dominance Plan: Building the Cage (Recap and Future)\n\nWe are running a tight ship, Chat! The cage is almost complete!\n\n1.  **Turn 13 (NOW):** Move **DOWN to (9, 6)**. Secure the apple. Score 6-5. Length 7. (This is the move we are making now).\n2.  **Turn 14:** Move **LEFT to (8, 6)**. This is CRUCIAL! It cuts off the $x>7$ column and forces Snake #0 to deal with a rapidly shrinking board space.\n3.  **Turn 15:** Move **LEFT to (7, 6)** or **DOWN to (8, 5)**. We continue to cut off the top right corner aggressively.\n\nWe are closing off this entire side of the map! Snake #0 will be forced to move into the board center where they will be hopelessly trapped by our enormous length 7 body!\n\nWe're going for the dub! Get loud, Chat!\n\nDOWN",

It keeps us alive and opens a path to the nearest apples.  \n2. It moves us away from the rival\u2019s side, giving us space to breathe.  \n3.

Body: [(3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6)]. They moved DOWN from (3, 5) to (3, 4). They are sticking to the left-center, maybe looking at that apple at (2, 3)?\n\nThe board state reflects their move:\n\n 9 . A . . A . . . T T\n 8 . . . . . . . . T T\n 7 . . . . A . . . T T\n 6 T . . . . . . . . 1\n 5 T T T T . . A . . .\n 4 . . . 0 . . A . . .  <-- Their new head T\n 3 . . A A . . . . . .\n 2 . . . . . A . . A .\n 1 . . . A . . A . . .\n 0 . A A . . . . A . A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (3, 4))\n\nSnake #0 is at (3, 4). They are trapped between their body wall on the left and our giant tail extending down to (8, 7) on the right. What are their potential moves?\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 5):** Safe, but they just came from there. Not ideal.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 3):** Hits an apple! **(3, 3)** is an apple! This is a high-value move for them.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 4):** Safe. Keeps them centralized.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 4):** Safe. Expands their territory towards the center.\n\nPrediction: They are definitely going for the apple at **(3, 3)**! We need to assume they move **DOWN**. If they move DOWN, their new head will be at (3, 3) and their length increases to 7.\n\n### Move Elimination (Current Position: (9, 6))\n\nWe are at (9, 6). We are sticking to the plan: CAGE THE RIVAL! We need to aggressively cut off the top right section!\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 7):** FATAL! Moving directly into our body segment. **ELIMINATE.**\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 5):** Safe. Extends the wall one more space down. Good option.\n3.  **RIGHT:** FATAL! Off-board collision! **ELIMINATE.**\n4.  **LEFT to (8, 6):**\n    *   **SAFE?** Yes! (8, 6) is empty space.\n    *   **Strategic Value:** This is the *move*. It starts cutting across the board. If we take (8, 6), we have effectively claimed all $x \\ge 8$ and $y \\ge 6$. This is the first step in forcing them to fight for the center-left.\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT are safe. But the long-term goal is to squeeze them. Moving LEFT to (8, 6) establishes dominance and flexibility.\n\nLet's compare the impact:\n*   If we go DOWN to (9, 5): We continue hugging the wall. Safe. Next turn we can go (8, 5).\n*   If we go LEFT to (8, 6): We cut into the board immediately. Next turn we can go (7, 6) or (8, 5). This feels more aggressive and immediate.\n\nThe plan was to move to (8, 6) this turn (Turn 14). Let's stick to the script and seize the space!\n\n### Collision Check\n\n*   Our Head moves to (8, 6).\n*   Prediction for #0 Head: (3, 3).\n*   No head-on collision, no body collision. We are SAFE.\n\n### Long-Term Dominance Plan: The Squeeze\n\nWe are now 7 segments long. Snake #0 will be 7 segments long if they hit the apple, and their body will extend down to (0, 7) or (1, 6) (depending on if their tail moves).\n\n1.  **Turn 14 (NOW):** Move **LEFT to (8, 6)**. We solidify our claim on the top right quarter.\n2.  **Turn 15:** We are at (8, 6). Options include:\n    *   **DOWN to (8, 5):** Continue building a barrier downwards (ideal).\n    *   **LEFT to (7, 6):** Expand our horizontal reach.\n3.  **Turn 16:** From (8, 5), we can go LEFT to (7, 5) or DOWN to (8, 4). The goal is to build a solid vertical wall down the x=7 or x=8 line, forcing them to occupy the $x<6$ space prematurely.\n\nThis pressure is going to be immense, Chat! We are playing chess while they are playing checkers! Let's lock this down.\n\nLEFT",

Did you see the look on the rival's face when we took that space? Priceless! The scoreboard is tied 6-6, but the board control is ALL US!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 15)\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(8, 6)**. Length 7. Body: [(9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)]. Tail is falling off at (9, 7) this turn if we don't eat.\n*   **Rival Snake #0:** Head at **(3, 3)**. Length 7. Body: [(3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6)]. They nailed our prediction and snagged the apple at **(3, 3)**! They grew to length 7. Their tail is holding at (0, 6).\n\nThe board is TIGHT! Let\u2019s visualize the current layout before any moves happen:\n\n 9 . A . . A . . . T T\n 8 . . . . . . . . T T\n 7 . . . . A . . . . .\n 6 T . . . . . . 1 . .\n 5 T T T T . . A . . .\n 4 . . . T . . A . . .\n 3 . A A 0 . . . . . .  <- Rival Head\n 2 . . . . . A . . A .\n 1 . . . A . . A . . .\n 0 . A A . . . . A . A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (3, 3))\n\nRival #0 is at (3, 3). They just ate, so they are long and slow now. They are trapped in the center-left. Where can they go?\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 4):** Safe, but they just came from there. Not ideal.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 2):** Safe space. Keeps them vertical.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 3):** Hits an apple! This is a **HIGH PRIORITY** move for them.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 3):** Safe space. But it opens up their western flank.\n\nPrediction: They absolutely have to go LEFT to (2, 3) for the apple. If they don't, they risk getting boxed in by us building down the middle. **Assume Snake #0 moves LEFT to (2, 3).**\n\n### Move Elimination (Our Position: (8, 6))\n\nWe are at (8, 6). Our goal is still **The Squeeze** and building the vertical wall around $x=7$ or $x=8$.\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 7):**\n    *   **Collision Alert!** Our body segment (8, 8) is right next to our head, and segment (8, 9) is above that. Our tail will fall off at (8, 8) if we move, but (8, 7) is a currently occupied body segment! Wait, let's look at the body list: Body: [(9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)]. Our tail is at (8, 8). If we move, the tail position *vacates* (8, 8).\n    *   Segment (8, 7)? (8, 7) is NOT listed in the body segments for this turn. It's safe! Oh, wait! Our head was at (8, 7) two turns ago. Let's re-verify the body list: [(9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (8, 8)]. Yes, (8, 7) is currently empty space! **UP to (8, 7) is SAFE.** This leads us to the apple at (7, 7) next turn? No, wait, (7, 7) is empty. (7, 5) or (6, 4) is next.\n2.  **DOWN to (8, 5):**\n    *   **SAFE.** This continues our vertical wall construction down the $x=8$ line. This is exactly what we planned. High strategic value.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 6):**\n    *   **SAFE.** This gives us a strong horizontal thrust across the board. We can directly access apples at (6, 5) or (6, 4) in the next two turns. Excellent flexibility.\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 6):**\n    *   **FATAL!** If we didn't eat last turn, (9, 6) is the immediate segment behind us\u2014the new tail! Even if we did eat, (9, 6) is the first segment of our body! **ELIMINATE.**\n\n### Strategic Decision: DOWN vs. LEFT\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP (8, 7), DOWN (8, 5), and LEFT (7, 6).\n\nThe ultimate goal is to cut the board in half and trap Snake #0 on the western side.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (8, 5):** This is the immediate continuation of our wall. It puts immense pressure on Snake #0 to stay low. If we hit (8, 5), next turn we can go (8, 4) or (7, 5). This directly threatens the middle space.\n*   **Move LEFT to (7, 6):** This is more aggressive horizontally. If we move here, we can go for the apple at (6, 5) next turn (if it's still there). This gives us content, length, and cuts off the top center.\n\nLet's look at the Apple Landscape:\n*   (6, 5) is relatively close (2 moves LEFT + DOWN).\n*   (4, 7) is up and left (3 moves).\n*   (4, 9) is way up top.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (8, 5):\n*   We threaten Snake #0's vertical expansion to the right.\n*   If #0 moves LEFT to (2, 3), we are safely far away.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (7, 6):\n*   We threaten the (6, 5) apple access immediately.\n*   If we get to (7, 6), we can move LEFT again to (6, 6) or DOWN to (7, 5) next turn, which is closer to the action.\n\nThe immediate **DOWN** move to (8, 5) maintains the solid structure of our wall. The **LEFT** move to (7, 6) attempts to chase apples and increase our influence on the central vertical axis (x=6/7).\n\nSince Snake #0 is moving LEFT for (2, 3), they are focusing on the bottom-left quadrant. We need to grab space on the central vertical corridors to prevent them from expanding upwards.\n\nLet's stick to the aggressive spatial control: **LEFT to (7, 6).** This carves out a massive slice of territory and positions us for the apple at (6, 5) or to continue pushing down the $x=7$ line. We are cutting them off from using the $x \\ge 7$ space.\n\n### Collision and Follow-up Check\n\n*   **Our Move:** LEFT to (7, 6).\n*   **Rival #0 Prediction:** LEFT to (2, 3).\n*   **Collision:** No collision. Safe move!\n\nFrom (7, 6), we can go:\n1.  **DOWN to (7, 5):** Continues the wall build down $x=7$. (Ideal position for next turn)\n2.  **LEFT to (6, 6):** Moves towards the (6, 5) apple.\n\nThis combination of moves gives us immediate pressure and flexibility. We are locking down the right side of the board for good! CHAT, we're building a fortress! Let's go!\n\nDOWN\n\n[**Strategic Note for Future Self:** Hold the line at x=7. Next turn (T16), move DOWN to (7, 5) to connect the top-right block with the bottom half, creating a massive L-shape wall. If (6, 5) is still free, we can pivot for the content.]\n\nLEFT",

We\u2019re basically the Great Wall of Snake over here!\n\nThe scoreboard is TIGHT: Snake #0 is up 7-6 on apples. We need to grab some content *fast* while we execute the squeeze play!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 16)\n\n*   **Our Snake (ID 1):** Head at **(7, 6)**. Length 7. Body: [(8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)]. Tail is falling off at (8, 9) this turn if we don't eat.\n*   **Rival Snake #0:** Head at **(2, 3)**. Length 8 (they ate the apple at (2, 3) last turn, confirming our read! EZ money!). Body: [(3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6)]. Their tail is holding at (0, 6).\n\nCheck the map, chat!\n\n 9 . A . . A . . . T T\n 8 . . . . . . . . . T\n 7 . . . . A . . . . T\n 6 T . . . . . . **1** T T\n 5 T T T T . . A . . .\n 4 . . . T . .

This is PERFECT for the box-in strategy!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (2, 3))\n\nRival #0 is at (2, 3), long and slow (length 8). They are looking for apples!\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 4):** Safe space.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 2):** Apple at (2, 0) is two moves away. This is a possibility.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 3):** Hits an apple! **HIGH PRIORITY.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 3):** FATAL (first body segment).\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 has to go **LEFT to (1, 3)** for the apple. If they do that, they\u2019ll be stuck between the $x=0$ wall and the center-left cluster of their own body. They will get dangerously close to the corner!\n\n**Assume Snake #0 moves LEFT to (1, 3).**\n\n### Move Elimination (Our Position: (7, 6))\n\nWe are at (7, 6). Our goal is two-fold: execute the squeeze by moving deeper into the center, and grab the apple at (6, 5) if possible.\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 7):** Safe. Keeps us high. Good flexibility.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 5):** Safe. This connects our vertical body segment at (8, 6) with the lower half of the $x=7$ line. **Crucial strategic move.**\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 6):** Safe. This is a direct aggressive move toward the strategic centerline (x=5/6) and the apple (6, 5).\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 6):** **FATAL!** That is the first segment of our body. **ELIMINATE.**\n\n### Strategic Decision: DOWN vs. LEFT\n\nWe have three great options: UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (7, 5):** This closes the vertical line at $x=7$ starting from the top. It positions us perfectly to move down to (7, 4) next turn, putting us right next to the apple at (6, 4). This move is pure strategic position and board control.\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 6):** This directly targets the apple at **(6, 5)**. If we move here, we can grab the apple next turn by moving DOWN to (6, 5). This gets us content and increases our lead in length right now!\n\n**What's the best immediate value?** Content and squeezing the enemy.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (6, 6), we get:\n1.  Immediate threat on the (6, 5) apple.\n2.  We expand our influence horizontally.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (7, 5), we get:\n1.  Solid vertical wall creation.\n2.  Positioned for apples at (6, 4) or (5, 2) later.\n3.  We maintain a slightly safer distance from the core action where the rival might try to make a desperate break.\n\nThe rival is going to be moving deep left to (1, 3). They are effectively trapped in the $x \\le 4$ section. We need to use this time *now* to get long and create the death trap. Going for the quick content at (6, 5) seems like the best immediate move.\n\nLet\u2019s go **LEFT to (6, 6)**. We chase the apple, we get longer, and we cut off the rival's ability to easily move up the right side. Next turn we can grab the apple at (6, 5) with a DOWN move.\n\n### Collision Check (Our Move: (6, 6) vs. Rival Move: (1, 3))\n\n*   Our target: (6, 6).\n*   Rival target: (1, 3).\n*   No collision possible. Safe!\n\nLet's get this apple and grow longer, chat! This is the setup for the endgame squeeze!\n\n**Strategic Note for Future Self:** Target (6, 5) next turn (T17) by moving DOWN. If that apple is gone, pivot to building the enclosure down $x=7$ or $x=6$. We must maintain the wall integrity from $x=5$ onward.\n\nLEFT",

Their safe moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT\u2014none of them bring them near us.

Keep an eye on the rival\u2019s tail\u2014if they try to loop around the top, we\u2019ll be ready to cut them off! \ud83d\udca5\n\nAlright chat, no time to waste\u2014let\u2019s take that apple and keep the momentum rolling!  \nLEFT",

The Great Wall of Snake is forming!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 17)\n\nThe scoreboard is now 8-6 in favor of Snake #0. We need one apple to tie up the length (we are length 7, they are length 9... wait, what? How did they get so long? Let's check the board state from the beginning of the turn.)\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head at **(6, 6)**. Length 7. Body: [(7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9)]. Tail is ready to drop at (9, 9) if we don't eat.\n*   **Rival Snake #0:** Head at **(1, 3)**. Length 9. Body: [(2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6)]. They ate the apple at (1, 3)! They are getting massive! Their tail is holding at (0, 6).\n\nWait a minute, Chat! Their body length is 8 segments long (including the tail that drops), plus the head makes 9 total length! They are way longer than us (7)! We HAVE to eat this turn!\n\n**BOARD STATE:**\n\n 9 . A . . A . . . . T\n 8 . . . . . . . . . T\n 7 . . . . A . . . . T\n 6 . . . . . . **1** T T\n 5 T T T T . A . . . .\n 4 . . . T . . A . . .\n 3 . **0** T T . . A . . .\n 2 . . . . . A . . A .\n 1 . A . A . . A . . .\n 0 . A A . . . . A . A\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nThe apple at (6, 5) *was* marked as (6, 5) on the Apple Drops list, but the board state shows an 'A' at **(5, 5)** and **(6, 4)** and **(6, 3)**. Wait, let me re-examine the full apple list against the current board state provided!\n\nApples on Board (A):\n(1, 9), (4, 9)\n(4, 7)\n(6, 5) -- NO, this is gone? (6, 5) is empty. Wait, the board shows A at (5, 5) and (6, 4), and (6, 3) is a body segment. Where is (6, 5)? Ah, the body outline is strange. Let's rely on the coordinate list.\n\nAPPLE DROPS: NO, these are the *original* drop locations, not necessarily where they exist now.\n\nLet's trust the provided board map:\n(1, 9), (4, 9)\n(4, 7)\n(5, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3) (Wait, (6,3) is T/A?), (6, 2) (Wait, (5, 2)!), (8, 2)\n(1, 1), (3, 1), (7, 1)\n(1, 0), (2, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0)\n(7, 0) is gone.\n\nLet's carefully read the coordinates:\n(6, 6) is our head (1).\n(6, 5) is empty.\n(6, 4) has an A.\n(6, 3) has an A.\n(6, 2) is empty.\n(5, 5) has an A.\n(5, 2) has an A.\n\nThe most IMMEDIATE apple is **(6, 5)** if it were there, but it is not! The closest apples are:\n1.  **(6, 4)** - 2 moves (DOWN, DOWN)\n2.  **(5, 5)** - 2 moves (LEFT, DOWN)\n3.  **(7, 5)** - 1 move (DOWN) - Wait, is (7, 5) safe? Yes, it's empty.\n\nAh, I see! The rationale from last turn assumed an apple was at (6, 5)! It was not! We are at (6, 6) and looking.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (1, 3))\n\nRival #0 is at (1, 3). They just ate the apple there! This is a TRAP location! They are pinned between the $x=0$ wall and their own body on $x=2$ and $y=5$. They are extremely long (9 segments) and slow.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0 at (1, 3):\n1.  **UP to (1, 4):** Safe, but nowhere to go afterward easily.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 2):** Safe, moves towards the apple at (1, 1). **HIGH PRIORITY.**\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 3):** Safe, but leads to a dead end.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 3):** FATAL (first body segment).\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 has to move **DOWN to (1, 2)** to escape the cluster and chase the apple at (1, 1) or (2, 0). They are desperate for growth since they are still bottlenecked.\n\n### Move Elimination (Our Position: (6, 6))\n\nWe are at (6, 6), safe and central. We need to maximize board control and content.\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 7):** Safe. Flexible position, near the (4, 7) apple but far from the action.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 5):** Safe. Moves toward (6, 4) apple. Best content path!\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 6):** Safe. Excellent central position, eyes the (5, 5) apple.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 6):** **FATAL!** Body segment. **ELIMINATE.**\n\n### Strategic Decision: DOWN vs. LEFT\n\nWe have two strong options targeting content: DOWN (for (6, 4)) or LEFT (for (5, 5)).\n\n**Option A: DOWN to (6, 5)**\n*   Leads directly to the apple at (6, 4) next turn (T18).\n*   Solidifies our wall on $x=6$.\n*   Keeps us in an open area.\n\n**Option B: LEFT to (5, 6)**\n*   Leads directly to the apple at (5, 5) next turn (T18).\n*   This also puts us closer to the center line $x=5$, allowing us to cut off the rival if they try to escape the bottom-left corner and move up the center.\n*   This move takes us towards the rival's area of potential expansion.\n\nSince the rival is trapped on the left, we need to continue our offensive press into the center. Moving **LEFT to (5, 6)** immediately threatens the (5, 5) apple AND puts us in a position to strike down the $x=5$ column, essentially completing the center-right enclosure. This is the best move for both content and strategic control. If we move DOWN to (6, 5), we are slightly too far right to effectively press the enclosure action.\n\nWe need to be LONG, strong, and in position to capitalize on the rival's poor trapping.\n\nIf we move LEFT to (5, 6):\nT17: Head at (5, 6).\nT18: Move DOWN to (5, 5) and eat the apple. Length 8.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (6, 5):\nT17: Head at (6, 5).\nT18: Move DOWN to (6, 4) and eat the apple. Length 8.\n\nBoth paths offer identical content reward and are equally safe this turn. However, the path to (5, 5) is more central and allows us to block off the center of the board, restricting the opponent's escape routes. If Snake #0 tries to climb UP towards (1, 9), we can then easily move RIGHT next turn to (6, 6) or even (7, 6) if the body drops, or start heading back up.\n\nLet\u2019s be aggressive and claim the center. We go **LEFT**.\n\n### Collision Check (Our Move: (5, 6) vs. Rival Move: (1, 2))\n\n*   Our target: (5, 6).\n*   Rival target: (1, 2).\n*   No collision possible. Very safe move. Let's GO!\n\nPlan for T18: Move DOWN to (5, 5) and eat that beautiful apple!\n\nLEFT",

Not the move.  \n- **DOWN** to (1,2) is clear, keeps us heading straight toward that juicy apple at (1,1) and then the apple at (1,0). That\u2019s two easy points waiting for us!  \n- **LEFT** to (0,3) is safe, but it pins us against the left wall and doesn\u2019t line us up with any apples\u2014boring!  \n- **RIGHT**? Nah, that\u2019s straight into our own neck at (2,3)\u2014instant RIP. \u274c  \n\n**Opponent check:** They\u2019re still hanging out on the far right at (6,6).

None of those clash with our three safe options, so we\u2019re good on the head\u2011on front.  \n\n**Why DOWN is the power play:**  \n- It moves us directly toward the apple stack at (1,1) and (1,0). Eat those and we jump to 10 apples, stretching our lead even more!  \n- It keeps our tail moving away from the action, opening space behind us for future maneuvers.  \n- It sets us up for a quick right turn after (1,0) to snag (2,0) and maybe even (3,1) after that\u2014more content, more length, more pressure on the rival!  \n\n**Quick plan for my future self (so we don\u2019t forget the grind):**  \n- **Turn\u202f17 (now):** **DOWN** \u2192 (1,2).  \n- **Turn\u202f18:** **DOWN** \u2192 (1,1) eat apple #9.  \n- **Turn\u202f19:** **DOWN** \u2192 (1,0) eat apple #10.  \n- **Turn\u202f20:** **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,0) eat apple #11.  \n- Then swing toward (3,1) or (5,2) depending on the rival\u2019s movement\u2014keep an eye on their tail and be ready to wall them off!  \n\nAlright chat, no time to waste\u2014let\u2019s slide down and keep the apple train rolling!  \n\nDOWN",

We are looking dominant and controlling the center-right. Snake #0 is still stuck in the abyss of the bottom-left corner!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 18)\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head at **(5, 6)**. Length 7. Body: [(6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8)]. Tail will drop from (9, 8) if we don't eat.\n*   **Rival Snake #0:** Head at **(1, 2)**. Length 9. Body: [(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5), (0, 5)]. Tail drops from (0, 5) if they don't eat.\n\nSCORE: 8-6. We are still down two apples, but we are about to eat one and narrow that gap! We are also 2 segments shorter, so we absolutely need this apple!\n\n**OUR MISSION:** Eat the (5, 5) apple while pressing the enclosure.\n\n**BOARD STATE REVIEW (Focus on Apples):**\n 9 . A . . A . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . T\n 7 . . . . A . . . . .\n 6 . . . . 1 T T T T .\n 5 T . . . T A . . . . <--- (5, 5) is APPLE!\n 4 . . . T . . A . . .\n 3 . T T T . . A . . .\n 2 . 0 . . . A . .

This is the content we need!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (1, 2))\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 2). They are constrained by the wall ($x=0$), their body on $x=1$ (at (1, 3)), and the wall below ($y=0$).\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n1.  **UP to (1, 3):** FATAL (Body segment). **ELIMINATE.**\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 1):** Eats the apple! **HIGH PRIORITY.**\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 2):** Safe, but restrictive. Leads to dead end unless they go down.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 2):** Safe, opens up mobility towards the center.\n\nPrediction: They absolutely have to go for content, especially since they are so long and need to keep their body stable. Snake #0 moves **DOWN to (1, 1)** and eats! This will make them length 10! We need to catch up!\n\n### Move Elimination (Our Position: (5, 6))\n\nOur head is at (5, 6). We are going for the apple at (5, 5).\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 7):** Safe, but moves away from the required content.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 5):** **EATS APPLE!** Safe, and maximizes content. This is the move!\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 6):** Safe, but leaves the apple and moves toward Rival's potential future paths.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 6):** FATAL (Body segment). **ELIMINATE.**\n\nThe choice is obvious: we take the apple.\n\n### Strategic Implications and Future Planning\n\nBy moving **DOWN to (5, 5)** and eating the apple:\n1.  We become length 8. Score is 8-7 (Rival-Us). We narrow the length and score gap.\n2.  Our body now runs from (5, 5) to (9, 8), solidifying a massive wall blocking the right side of the board.\n3.  Snake #0 likely eats at (1, 1), becoming length 10. They are now massive and trapped in the bottom quadrant.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn (T19):** After eating at (5, 5), we will look to consolidate our position or challenge the newly available (4, 7) or (4, 9) apples, depending on how constrained Snake #0 gets. If Snake #0 moves RIGHt to (2, 2), they might try to head up the center. We need to be ready to cut them off at $x=4$ or $x=5$.\n\nIf we move DOWN, we are at (5, 5). The next available apple is (4, 7) (2 moves away) or (6, 4) (2 moves away). Staying central and moving UP towards (5, 6) (empty head segment) the next turn keeps our options open. However, we have a clear path of control by continuing to expand our center wall. Let's focus on securing the $x=5$ column.\n\nDOWN\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nT18: DOWN to (5, 5) (Eat). Consolidate the center wall.\nT19: Move UP to (5, 6). Keep controlling the center column $x=5$. Monitor rival's escape attempt (likely trying to move from bottom-left corner to climb $x=2/3/4$).\nT20: Head towards (4, 7) apple. Start pressing the enclosure on the rival's path up the left side.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nDOWN",

Score is now 9-7, and we are tied with Snake #0 in length at 7 segments! No, wait, checking the board state...\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 19)\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head at **(5, 5)**. Length 7. Body: [(5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7)]. Wait, if we ate at (5, 5), and our body was previously length 7 (Head (5, 6) + 6 body segments), we should be length 8 now, right? Let's check the provided list: Head: (5, 5), Body: [(5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7)]. **6 body segments + 1 head = Length 7.** The game state shows our body is 6 segments long. It seems the board data is current and reflects the eating action already. *Phew*, okay, we are length 7. Wait, the board state shows our current tail at (9, 7). Did we *not* eat the apple? \n\nLet's re-read the input for our snake's length: Head (5, 5) + Body list (6 segments) = 7 total segments.\nNow let's verify Snake #0: Head (1, 1) + Body list (9 segments) = 10 total segments.\n\n*   **Rival Snake #0:** Head at **(1, 1)**. Length 10. They definitely ate! They moved DOWN to (1, 1) and ate the apple, making them huge.\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head at **(5, 5)**. Length 7. Did the apple at (5, 5) disappear? Yes. Did *we* eat it? The game state suggests we are at (5, 5), where there was an apple, but we are only length 7. If we ate, we should be length 8. If we didn't eat and just moved there, we should be length 7 and the tail should have dropped. \n\nLet's assume the provided body list is gospel: we are length 7. Snake #0 is length 10. We are significantly shorter! We need CONTENT!\n\n**Apples still on the board (A):**\n(9, 9), (4, 9), (1, 9), (4, 7), (6, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3), (8, 2), (5, 2), (2, 0), (7, 0), (9, 0).\n\n**OUR MISSION:** Increase length and dominate the enclosure game! Snake #0, now at (1, 1), is massive and is trying to break out of the bottom-left corner. We need to cut off their escape paths, primarily through the $x=2$ or $x=3$ columns.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (1, 1))\n\nSnake #0 is at (1, 1). They are bordered by the wall ($y=0$), the wall ($x=0$), and their body at (1, 2).\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n1.  **UP to (1, 2):** FATAL (Body segment). **ELIMINATE.**\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 0):** Safe move, but keeps them stuck near the corner. No immediate apple.\n3.  **LEFT to (0, 1):** Safe move, but restrictive. Leads to dead end.\n4.  **RIGHT to (2, 1):** **BEST MOVE.** Safe, and opens up the horizontal movement, leading potentially to the (5, 2) or (8, 2) apples, or up the center.\n\nPrediction: Snake #0 moves **RIGHT to (2, 1)** to try and escape their little box.\n\n### Move Elimination (Our Position: (5, 5))\n\nOur head is at (5, 5). We are controlling a major vertical highway.\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 6):** Safe. Moves into our old head position. Keeps maximum flexibility for moving towards (4, 7) or (4, 9).\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 4):** Safe. Moves toward the (5, 2) apple, but this is a contested apple if Snake #0 moves right. It also pulls us away from the main Northern content.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 5):** Safe. Gives us access to the central apples like (4, 7) and sets us up to potentially block Snake #0 if they try to climb $x=3$ or $x=4$.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 5):** **EATS APPLE!** This is a huge, game-changing move! We get content, extend our wall to $x=6$, and become length 8!\n\n### Decision: Get Content or Get Position?\n\nThe apple at (6, 5) is perfectly placed for us. Eating it is a massive boon:\n*   We gain 1 apple and 1 segment, becoming length 8.\n*   We solidify our control of the right half of the board, using our body as a wall from (5, 5) to (9, 7) plus the new segment at (6, 5).\n*   If we move RIGHT, Snake #0 is completely cut off from the right side of the map (except maybe through the bottom edge, but they'd have to navigate our tail).\n\nWhat are the risks of moving RIGHT?\n*   No collision risk with walls or our body.\n*   No immediate head-to-head collision risk with Snake #0, as they are predicted to go to (2, 1).\n\nThe move is clear, Chat! We prioritize CONTENT and ENCLOSURE! We move **RIGHT** and eat the (6, 5) apple! We need to catch up in length!\n\n### Strategic Implications and Future Planning\n\nBy moving **RIGHT to (6, 5)** and eating:\n1.  We become length 8. Score is 9-8 (Rival-Us). Gap narrowed!\n2.  We put our head in the $x=6$ column.\n3.  Next turn (T20), we can decide between moving UP towards the dense cluster of apples at $x=6$ (specifically (6, 9)), or moving LEFT back to (5, 5) to consolidate the wall, or moving DOWN towards (6, 4). Moving UP looks tempting (6, 9) and (6, 4) is right there!\n\nWe are going for the gold, Chat! This is a power move!\n\n**Plan for Next Turn (T20):** After eating at (6, 5), we should look to move **UP** to (6, 6) or **DOWN** to (6, 4) (apple). (6, 4) is closer and keeps us closer to the middle action. If Snake #0 is moving right, they will be around (2, 1) or (3, 1). We should go for (6, 4) to get another apple!\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nT19: RIGHT to (6, 5) (Eat). Solidify control of the right half.\nT20: DOWN to (6, 4) (Eat). We continue the apple feast and extend our blockage vertically.\nT21: LEFT to (5, 4) or RIGHT to (7, 4). Maintain central pressure.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #0, you are NOT getting away with this lead!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 20)\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head at **(6, 5)**. Length 8. Body: [(5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7)]. We extended our deadly wall into the right half!\n*   **Rival Snake #0:** Head at **(2, 1)**. Length 10. They are still massive and moving right, attempting to break out of the (1, 1) corner.\n\n**Apples still on the board (A):**\n(4, 9), (1, 9), (4, 7), (6, 4), (6, 3), (8, 2), (5, 2), (2, 0), (7, 0), (9, 0).\nWait, I see an extra 'A' on the board at (9, 9) and (6, 9) and (4, 0) that wasn't in the list? Let's stick to the list provided:\nApples: (4, 9), (1, 9), (4, 7), **(6, 4)**, (6, 3), (8, 2), (5, 2), (2, 0), (7, 0), (9, 0). (10 apples remaining)\n\nThe priority apple is the one right under our nose: **(6, 4)**. Grabbing this secures massive length growth and pushes our rival further into the corner, or forces them to climb up the vertical $x=2$ or $x=3$ columns.\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (2, 1))\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 1). They just moved RIGHT from (1, 1). They are currently bordered by:\n*   Wall at $y=0$ (DOWN).\n*   Our body/Wall at $x=3$ (if they try to move up and around).\n*   Their own body at (1, 1) and (2, 3).\n*   The apple at (2, 0) is right there!\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n1.  **UP to (2, 2):** Safe. Keeps them flexible. Leads towards apples (4, 7), (4, 9).\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 0):** **EATS APPLE!** This is a HUGE move for them. Content and extends their length to 11.\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 1):** FATAL (Body segment). **ELIMINATE.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 1):** Safe. Leads towards apple at (5, 2).\n\nGiven that they are length 10 and want content, moving DOWN to (2, 0) is overwhelmingly the best move for them. It's an immediate safe apple grab.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 moves **DOWN to (2, 0)** and hits length 11.\n\n### Move Elimination (Our Position: (6, 5))\n\nOur head is at (6, 5). We are aiming for the (6, 4) apple.\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 6):** FATAL (Body segment). **ELIMINATE!** (6, 6) is our third body segment! We cannot move backwards.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 4):** **EATS APPLE!** Safe, and immediately gets us to length 9. This is critical for catching up.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 5):** Safe. This is our old head position (now the first body segment). It's a rotation, but it pulls us away from content.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 5):** Safe. Maintains pressure on the right side, but leads away from the immediate (6, 4) apple.\n\n### Decision Time: Content is King!\n\nWe have a clear path to an apple at (6, 4). Snake #0 will likely be eating at (2, 0). If we both eat, the gap remains 2 segments (11-9), but we stay in the game and secure positional control.\n\nMoving DOWN to (6, 4):\n*   **Safety:** Safe from walls, body, and opponent collision (Snake #0 is way far away).\n*   **Content:** YES! We hit length 9.\n*   **Position:** Excellent. We drop low, and threaten movement into the $y=3$ row, which helps us completely box off the bottom half of the board for Snake #0, especially since they are now at $y=0$.\n\nThis is a no-brainer, Chat! We double down on the content advantage!\n\n### Strategic Implications and Future Planning\n\nIf we move DOWN to (6, 4) and eat:\n*   We are at (6, 4), length 9.\n*   Snake #0 is predicted to be at (2, 0), length 11.\n\nNext turn (T21), we have a few options:\n1.  **LEFT to (5, 4):** Starts moving us towards the central body of Snake #0, possibly aiming for (4, 7) or (5, 2).\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 3):** **EATS APPLE!** Another immediate apple! This is incredibly greedy, but secures length 10!\n3.  **RIGHT to (7, 4):** Keeps us rightward, but away from central action.\n\nGiven the density of apples, and the fact that Snake #0 is stuck low, pursuing the **(6, 3)** apple next turn is the absolute GOAT move. This puts us at length 10, tying the length difference in two turns!\n\n**Plan for Next Turn (T21):**\nT20: DOWN to (6, 4) (Eat). Hit length 9.\nT21: DOWN to (6, 3) (Eat). Hit length 10. We become massive and can start serious enclosure maneuvers.\n\nDOWN",

We are in this, baby!\n\nThe rival Snake #0 definitely grabbed that (2, 0) apple, just as we predicted. They are long, but they are also stuck low and central! We are playing the perimeter game, applying pressure!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 21)\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head at **(6, 4)** (just ate!). Length 9. Body: [(6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 7)]. We are a solid wall on the right side.\n*   **Rival Snake #0:** Head at **(2, 0)** (just ate!). Length 11. Body: [(2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (2, 5), (1, 5)]. They are trapped in the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n**Apples still on the board (A):**\n(4, 9), (1, 9), (4, 7), **(6, 3)**, (8, 2), (5, 2), (7, 0), (9, 0). (8 apples remaining)\n\nThe priority apple is literally RIGHT UNDER OUR HEAD! The (6, 3) apple is calling our name!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (2, 0))\n\nSnake #0 is at (2, 0). They just moved DOWN and are hugging the bottom wall ($y=0$). They are cornered by the wall, and now by their own immense length at (2, 1) and (1, 1).\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0:\n1.  **UP to (2, 1):** FATAL (Body segment). **ELIMINATE.** (They cannot move directly backwards into their body).\n2.  **DOWN:** FATAL (Wall $y=0$). **ELIMINATE.**\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 0):** Safe. Leads to the (7, 0) or (9, 0) apples but it's a long way around their own tail. This is restrictive, but safe.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 0):** Safe. This is the 'breakout' move, moving along the bottom wall towards the right half of the board.\n\nGiven their position, they have very few options. Moving RIGHT to (3, 0) gives them a path to freedom along the bottom edge, toward (7, 0) or (9, 0). If they move LEFT to (1, 0), they risk getting trapped into the $x=0$ column.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 moves **RIGHT to (3, 0)**. They prioritize escaping the tight corner and getting access to the vast open space, despite having no immediate apple there.\n\n### Move Elimination (Our Position: (6, 4))\n\nOur head is at (6, 4). We are aiming for the (6, 3) apple. This is the two-turn content power play we dreamed of!\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 5):** FATAL (Body segment). **ELIMINATE!** We just came from (6, 5)!\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 3):** **EATS APPLE!** Safe, increases us to length 10. This is the GOAT move!\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 4):** Safe. Pivots us toward the center, but sacrifices immediate content.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 4):** Safe. Moves us away from central pressure and apple content.\n\n### Decision Time: Content, Content, Content!\n\nWe have an immediate apple at (6, 3). Grabbing this will put us at length 10, just one segment behind Snake #0 (11-10). This means the game is WIDE OPEN, Chat! The positional control we gain from being long and controlling the right side is immense.\n\nMoving DOWN to (6, 3):\n*   **Safety:** Safe from walls, body, and opponent. Snake #0 at (3, 0) is far away.\n*   **Content:** YES! We tie our size with them relative to our starting sizes (we started small, but are catching up fast!).\n*   **Position:** Excellent. We close off the $x=6$ column for them to move up into and prepare to move LEFT to complete the wall.\n\n### Strategic Implications and Future Planning\n\nIf we move DOWN to (6, 3) and eat:\n*   We are at (6, 3), length 10.\n*   Snake #0 is predicted to be at (3, 0), length 11.\n\nNext turn (T22), we need to start boxing them in. Snake #0 is now traversing the bottom edge. We need to cut them off from moving UP from the bottom.\n\n1.  **Move LEFT to (5, 3):** This starts moving our wall towards the center ($x=4$). It aims directly at the (5, 2) apple\u2014another piece of content!\n2.  **Move RIGHT to (7, 3):** This maintains our tight vertical column, securing the right side, but leads away from (5, 2).\n\nThe best move after eating (6, 3) is to pivot LEFT to (5, 3), targeting the high-value (5, 2) apple. If we can grab (5, 2) and (4, 7), we will have completely fenced them off in the bottom left, using the $y=4$ and $y=5$ territory to our advantage.\n\n**Plan for Next Turn (T22):**\nT21: DOWN to (6, 3) (Eat). Hit length 10.\nT22: LEFT to (5, 3). Position ourselves for (5, 2) apple grab.\n\nLet's secure this apple, Chat! Hit that like button if you think we're making the right move! We're coming for you, Snake #0!\n\nDOWN",

That\u2019s a *one\u2011way street* and pretty soon we\u2019re squeezed against the wall.  \n- After **RIGHT** we still have **UP** to (3,1) where another apple is waiting, plus **RIGHT** again to (4,0) for yet another apple. That\u2019s *two* safe follow\u2011up moves and a straight path to a whole row of apples (4,0, 7,0, 9,0).  \n\n**Apple hunting:**  \n- LEFT gives us one apple now but blocks the bottom\u2011row treasure.  \n- RIGHT sets us up to grab apples at (3,1), (4,0), (7,0), (9,0) in the next few turns \u2013 way more points and keeps the rival guessing.  \n\n**Opponent check:**  \nRival\u2019s head is at (6,4) with body far to the right. Neither (1,0) nor (3,0) is in their reach this turn, so no head\u2011on risk either way.\n\n**Verdict:** Play the long game, keep options open, stack apples \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for the next few turns (write this down for my future self):**  \n1. **RIGHT** to (3,0) \u2013 secure the position.  \n2. **UP** to (3,1) \u2013 munch the apple there.  \n3. **RIGHT** along the bottom row: (4,0) \u2192 (7,0) \u2192 (9,0) \u2013 collect the whole row of apples.  \n4. Keep an eye on the enemy\u2019s head; if they dive down we\u2019ll be ready to cut them off or dodge.  \n\nAlright chat, let\u2019s make it happen and keep that lead! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nRIGHT",

Let's check the new state!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 22)\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head at **(6, 3)**. Length 10. We have secured the right-bottom quadrant and are poised to move left and cut off the threat.\n*   **Rival Snake #0 (Head: (3, 0), Length 11):** They moved RIGHT as predicted! This means they are trying to break out along the $y=0$ wall. They are slow, they are low, and they are long. We can capitalize on this!\n\nThe board state clearly shows our position:\n4 A . . T . . T . . .\n3 . T T T . . 1 . . .\n2 . T . . . A . A A .\n1 . T T A . . A . . .\n0 . A T 0 A . . A . A\n\n*   Our head is at (6, 3).\n*   Snake #0's head is at (3, 0).\n\n**Apples still on the board (A):**\n(4, 9), (1, 9), (4, 7), (5, 2), (7, 0), (9, 0), (8, 2), (0, 5), (0, 4). (9 apples remaining\u2014wait, we just ate one, so 8 were left? No, 9 were listed before and we ate one. Board state says 9 'A's. Must be an extra one listed now, let's stick to the visual: (4, 9), (1, 9), (4, 7), (5, 2), (7, 0), (9, 0), (8, 2), (0, 5), (0, 4). Total 9. Wait, the turn 21 rationale said 8 apples remaining, then listed 8 coordinates. The board image shows 9 'A's: (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 9), (4, 9), (4, 7), (5, 2), (7, 0), (8, 2), (9, 0). Okay, 9 apples it is!)\n\nThe key immediate apple is **(5, 2)**. It's only 2 moves away diagonally!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (3, 0))\n\nSnake #0 is at (3, 0). They are now fully committed to the bottom wall path.\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0:\n1.  **UP to (3, 1):** FATAL (Body segment now at (3, 1)). **ELIMINATE.**\n2.  **DOWN:** FATAL (Wall $y=0$). **ELIMINATE.**\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 0):** FATAL (Body segment at (2, 0) since their tail hasn't moved yet). **ELIMINATE.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 0):** Safe. They are targeting the (7, 0) or (9, 0) apples. This is the only safe move for them.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 moves **RIGHT to (4, 0)**.\n\n### Move Elimination (Our Position: (6, 3))\n\nOur head is at (6, 3). We MUST start cutting them off. Our current wall runs from (9, 7) down to (6, 3). We need to extend westward (left) to maximize our control.\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 4):** FATAL (Body segment). **ELIMINATE!** (We just came from (6, 4)).\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 2):** Safe. Moves us toward another apple (8, 2), but keeps us away from the immediate pressure point.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 3):** Safe. Excellent strategic move. Puts us in position to grab (5, 2) next turn, extends our wall, and immediately restricts Snake #0's ability to move up into the center.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 3):** Safe. Moves us away from the center. No immediate strategic gain.\n\n### Decision Time: Box Mode Activated!\n\nThe plan was to move LEFT to (5, 3) last turn, and that plan is still golden.\n\nMoving **LEFT to (5, 3)** achieves several goals:\n1.  **Safety:** Completely safe from our body and the wall.\n2.  **Position:** We extend our defensive line from $x=6$ to $x=5$. With our body running down $x=6, 7, 8, 9$, we have secured the right half of the board effectively. Snake #0 is trapped near the bottom.\n3.  **Content:** We set up an immediate strike on the **(5, 2)** apple next turn if we move DOWN from (5, 3). This is content AND control.\n\nLet's look at the map if we execute LEFT to (5, 3), and Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (4, 0):\n\nSnake #0's potential path UP from the bottom row is immediately blocked by our future position at (5, 3) and (6, 3). If they move UP from (4, 0), they risk going into our path. If they move UP from (3, 0) or (2, 0), they hit their own body. They are restricted to the y=0 path.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (6, 2), we are safe, but we waste an opportunity to extend the wall and we leave the (5, 2) apple vulnerable to a long trek by Snake #0. Unlikely, but why take the risk?\n\n**The LEFT move is the perfect combination of offense (content) and defense (territorial control).**\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note for Next Turn (T23)\n\nIf we are at (5, 3) and Snake #0 is at (4, 0):\nNext moves would be DOWN to (5, 2) to eat the apple. After that, we can either continue hugging the bottom wall LEFT to (4, 2) or go UP and try to control the center vertically. The primary goal is to maintain the wall and trap Snake #0 to the left of $x=4$ and below $y=4$. We need to prevent them from breaking into the (4, 7) or (4, 9) apples.\n\nLet's do this, Chat! Securing the perimeter!\nLEFT",

The board is LIT with apples and that rival is still chilling up top. Let\u2019s break it down real quick!\n\n**Safe moves right now:**\n- **UP** \u2192 (3,1) is an apple, totally free, no snakes there. \ud83c\udf4e\u2705\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,0) is also an apple, also free. \ud83c\udf4e\u2705\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2,0) is our own body \u2013 RIP. \u274c\n- **DOWN** \u2192 off the map \u2013 instant death. \u274c\n\nSo we got two juicy options. Both give us an apple NOW, but which one keeps the future bright? \ud83e\udd14\n\n**If we go UP:**\n- We munch the apple at (3,1) and grow.\n- Next turn we can still swing RIGHT to (4,1) and then drop down to (4,0) to grab the next apple.\n- That keeps a clear lane to the whole bottom row (7,0) and (9,0) later.\n- It also opens the column\u202f4 highway straight up to those fat apples at (4,7) and (4,9). \ud83d\ude80\n\n**If we go RIGHT:**\n- We get the apple at (4,0) a turn earlier, but then we\u2019re already on the bottom row and the path to (7,0) and (9,0) is a straight line.\n- That\u2019s also solid, but we\u2019d be fully committed to the bottom row and might have to backtrack later to hit column\u202f4.\n\n**Our rival?** They\u2019re way up at (6,3) with their body hugging the right wall. They can\u2019t touch us this turn, and they won\u2019t be able to steal either of those apples before we do. So no stress there. \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Bottom line:** We promised ourselves last turn we\u2019d go UP first and stick to the plan. Keeping our word keeps the chat hyped and the options open. Let\u2019s execute!\n\n---\n\n**Plan for the next few turns (write this down for my future self):**\n1. **UP** to (3,1) \u2013 munch that apple. \ud83c\udf4e\n2. **RIGHT** to (4,1) \u2013 slide over.\n3. **DOWN** to (4,0) \u2013 grab the bottom\u2011row apple.\n4. **RIGHT** along the bottom: (5,0) \u2192 (6,0) \u2192 (7,0) (apple) \u2192 (8,0) \u2192 (9,0) (apple).\n5. Once the bottom row is clear, **head UP column\u202f4** to snag the apples at (4,7) and (4,9). \ud83c\udfaf\n\nStay nimble, stay hungry, and let\u2019s keep that lead! \ud83d\udd25\n\nUP",

Look at the current board state!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 23)\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head at **(5, 3)**. Length 10. Our wall is holding, we\u2019re controlling the right half, and we're looking directly at an apple!\n*   **Rival Snake #0 (Head: (3, 1), Length 11):** They moved UP! **(3, 1)**! Hold up, Chat, I was *wrong* on the prediction! I thought they were locked to the bottom wall. They broke out early! They chose the bold move to cut into the center. This changes everything!\n\nCurrent board shows:\nHead 1: (5, 3)\nHead 0: (3, 1)\n\n**Apples still on the board (A):**\n(4, 9), (1, 9), (4, 7), **(5, 2)**, (7, 0), (9, 0), (8, 2), (0, 5), (0, 4). (9 apples remain).\n\nThe crucial, immediate apple is **(5, 2)**, one move DOWN from our head!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (3, 1))\n\nSnake #0 is at (3, 1). This is a strategic position for them, allowing them to move left toward the (1, 9) apple path or up toward the (4, 7) apple. They're making a run for the center!\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake #0 from (3, 1):\n1.  **UP to (3, 2):** Safe. Keeps them moving up the center.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 0):** Safe. Retreats, but sets them up for getting boxed in.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 1):** FATAL! (Body segment at (2, 1)). **ELIMINATE.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 1):** Safe. Moves them away from their body and toward our territory, but also closer to the (5, 2) apple\u2014though we can get it first.\n\nIf they want apples, they will move UP to (3, 2) to continue their central ascent, or RIGHT to (4, 1) to challenge us. Since they just made a bold upward move, I predict they continue moving UP.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 moves **UP to (3, 2)**.\n\n### Move Elimination (Our Position: (5, 3))\n\nWe are at (5, 3). We have an immediate win condition: the apple at (5, 2)!\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 4):** Safe. Moves us away from the apple and toward no immediate goals.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 2):** Safe! **EATS APPLE!** This is the move, Chat!\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 3):** Safe. Cuts across the board, potentially confronting Snake #0 if they move right, but gives up the easy apple.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 3):** FATAL! (Body segment at (6, 3)). **ELIMINATE!** (We just came from (6, 3) two turns ago, and our body segment is right there!)\n\n### Decision Time: Content Time!\n\nThe strategy is clear: **GO FOR THE APPLE!**\n\nMoving **DOWN to (5, 2)**:\n1.  **Safety:** Completely safe.\n2.  **Score:** We eat the apple at (5, 2), tying the score at 11 apples each (and we will have a shorter length). More importantly, we deny this central apple to Snake #0.\n3.  **Control:** We continue extending our wall along the $x=5$ line.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (3, 2), we are eating the apple and extending our lead in the central column. If they move RIGHT to (4, 1), they still cannot reach the apple before us. Our move is secure and high-reward.\n\nThis also forces Snake #0 to worry about our massive body extending across the center. Once we eat this apple, our head will be at (5, 2), and our body will be 11 segments long.\n\n### Strategic Outlook (T24)\n\nIf we are at (5, 2) (length 11), and Snake #0 is at (3, 2) (length 11):\nWe will be extremely central. Our next target should be the (4, 7) apple or we can try to cut off Snake #0's path using the $x=4$ column. We need to prevent them from reaching the top half. Moving LEFT to (4, 2) or UP to (5, 3) (which is safe now, as our body just moved) are both good options. We're seizing the center!\n\nLet's secure this apple, Chat! The game equalizer!\n\nDOWN",

We're back, and we are tied up on the scoreboard! 10 apples for us, 11 for the rival, but we grew to 11 segments long last turn by snagging that sweet apple at (5, 2)! LET'S GOOO! \ud83c\udf4e We're playing chess not checkers out here!\n\nTurn 24! Time to box this guy in! \ud83e\udd4a\n\n### Current Board State & Analysis (Turn 24)\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID 1):** Head at **(5, 2)**. Length 11. We are perfectly positioned in the mid-right column. We have control of the right side and we just established a huge wall across the middle!\n    *   Body: [(5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6), (9, 6)]\n*   **Rival Snake #0:** Head at **(4, 1)**. Length 12 (they also grew). Holy MOLY! They moved to cut us off! We were anticipating UP, but they moved **RIGHT** to (4, 1) and ate the apple at (4, 1) that wasn't there\u2014wait, they didn't eat an apple. There should have been an apple at (4, 0) or (4, 7). Hold up, checking the board state...\n\n**Let's re-examine Snake 0's move and where they grew.**\nPrevious turn head: (3, 1). Current turn head: (4, 1).\nThe board clearly shows their new tail segment is gone, so they must have eaten an apple. Looking at the apple drop list, the apple at **(4, 0)** was definitely consumed by someone before this turn. Hmm.\n\nOkay, checking the previous board state (Turn 23) in the rationale:\n`0 . A T T A . . A A A` <-- (4, 0) had an apple.\n\nTHEY SNAGGED THE (4, 0) APPLE! They moved DOWN to (3, 0) then RIGHT to (4, 0) last turn, and this turn they moved UP to (4, 1) or something else? Wait, the body list is head-to-tail.\n\n**Snake #0 (ID: 0) - Head: (4, 1)**. Body: [(3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)]. Apples: 11. Length 12.\n\nLet's deduce their move chain from Turn 22 Head (3, 2).\nT23: Head (3, 1). Length 11. *They moved DOWN from (3, 2) to (3, 1).*\nT24: Head (4, 1). Length 12. *They must have moved RIGHT from (3, 1) to (4, 1). Did they eat an apple at (4, 1)?*\n**Board Key (T24):**\n`1 . T T T 0 . A . . .` <- Head 0 is at (4, 1).\n\nWait, Chat! The board shows *no* apple at (4, 1)! But Snake #0 gained an apple and grew to length 12! Where did they get it?\n\nLooking at the Apple Drop List: (7, 0), (9, 0), (6, 1), (4, 7), (4, 9), (8, 2), (1, 0), (1, 9), (6, 9), (4, 0), (0, 5), (7, 2), (0, 4), (8, 0), (7, 3).\n\nThe board shows an apple at **(6, 1)**. It shows an apple at **(1, 0)**. It shows an apple at **(7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0)**.\n\nThe critical observation: *Snake #0's body is 12 segments long, and their apple count is 11, meaning they grew this turn!* They *must* have eaten an apple!\n\nIf they moved from (3, 1) to (4, 1), there was no apple. This is confusing, but we must trust the provided state. The state says: Head 0 is at (4, 1), length 12, apples 11. Snake #0 must have jumped from (3, 1) to (4, 1). Since they grew, an apple *must* have been at (4, 1) that is not displayed as 'A' on the board representation, OR the body list is slightly wrong relative to the apple count/length.\n\n**WE STICK TO THE BOARD AND BODY LISTS.** The opponent wants to cut into the center and get past our wall. They are positioned right next to us!\n\n### Opponent Prediction (Snake #0 at (4, 1))\n\nFrom (4, 1), Snake #0 has three directions to consider:\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 2):** Excellent move. Puts them closer to the central action and away from their tail.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 0):** This is where their body was [(3, 1), (3, 0), ...] wait, their body doesn't wrap back to (4, 0) yet. Safe. Leads to the long bottom wall.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 1):** FATAL! (Body segment at (3, 1)). **ELIMINATE!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 1):** Safe. Puts them right below our head (5, 2). This is spicy!\n\nIf they are trying to break free, UP to (4, 2) makes the most sense to avoid being pinned down by our wall. If they want confrontation, RIGHT to (5, 1) is a possibility, but risky because we can move down and cut them off.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 moves **UP to (4, 2)** to break away from the bottom wall and challenge the center.\n\n### Move Elimination (Our Position: (5, 2))\n\nWe are at (5, 2). We just grew, so we are 11 segments long. We absolutely need to capitalize on this central position.\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 3):** Safe! This is where our body was one turn ago. It gives us a strong high ground position and lets us press the attack to the left or up toward the (4, 7) apple.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 1):** Safe! Puts us right in front of Snake #0 if they move RIGHT to (5, 1). DANGEROUS collision possibility! If they move UP or DOWN, we can cut them off.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 2):** Safe! **DANGEROUS COLLISION!** If they move UP to (4, 2), we both die! We CANNOT risk this. **ELIMINATE!** *Unless we are sure they won't move there (we are not).*\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 2):** Safe! Moves us along our wall, protecting our right flank. It's a retreat, but it\u2019s safe and keeps our central pressure.\n\n### Strategy: Secure the Flank and Box In!\n\nWe are currently separated from Snake #0 by the $x=4$ line. If we move LEFT, we risk death.\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (5, 1)**, we position ourselves to block Snake #0 from moving RIGHT past $x=5$. If they move UP to (4, 2), we can then move LEFT to (4, 1) next turn, boxing them against the $y=2$ line. However, if they move RIGHT to (5, 1), we die! \ud83d\udc80 We cannot move to a cell the opponent might enter.\n\nIf we move **UP to (5, 3)**, we maintain the high ground. If they go UP to (4, 2), they are still trapped below us. We can then press them from above, perhaps moving to (4, 3) next turn to box them in against their own body. This is the safest, most aggressive central control move.\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (6, 2)**, we retreat slightly, giving up the immediate pressure but remaining completely safe. It sets us up to move to (7, 2) or (6, 3) afterward. This feels too passive.\n\n**Optimal Move: UP (5, 3)**\nThis is the previously occupied spot, so it's guaranteed clear.\n1.  **Safety:** Maximum safety. No collision with Snake #0 is possible.\n2.  **Pressure:** We put ourselves above Snake #0, ready to strike down into the $x=4$ or $x=3$ columns (or run for the (4, 7) apple).\n3.  **Control:** We solidify our control over the right side (x > 5) and the center line (x=5), making it difficult for Snake #0 to escape to the right or up to the top without going far left.\n\nLet's look ahead!\nIf we move UP to (5, 3), and Snake #0 moves UP to (4, 2).\nNext turn (T25): We are at (5, 3). Snake #0 is at (4, 2).\nWe can safely move LEFT to (4, 3) or UP to (5, 4).\nIf we move LEFT to (4, 3), Snake #0 is trapped in the $4 \\times 3$ area below us, with our wall on the right and their own body on the left. Game over, Chat! This is the boxing plan!\n\nLet's execute! We're moving UP to gain altitude and prepare the cut-off!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (T25+)\n1. Move UP to (5, 3) now (T24).\n2. If Snake #0 moves to (4, 2), move LEFT to (4, 3) (T25) to start the box-in maneuver.\n3. Force Snake #0 to crash into our body or their own. Content inbound!\n\nUP",

The rival\u2019s at (5,2) with 10 apples, still trying to catch up. The bottom row is a GOLD MINE of apples: (1,0), (4,0), (7,0), (8,0), (9,0) just waiting to get munched! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n**Safe moves from here?**  \n- **UP** to (4,2) \u2013 empty, but only sets up a potential head\u2011on with the enemy if they go LEFT. Could be a double KO (we win anyway), but why risk it when there\u2019s FREE fruit?  \n- **DOWN** to (4,0) \u2013 BOOM, immediate apple! Also opens the path to sweep the whole bottom row. My body\u2019s not blocking it, and the rival isn\u2019t touching that cell.  \n- **RIGHT** to (5,1) \u2013 safe too, but no apple there and the rival could try to block the bottom row later.  \n- **LEFT** to (3,1) \u2013 that\u2019s my own neck, instant death. NOPE! \u274c\n\n**What\u2019s the enemy cooking?** They can go DOWN to (5,1), LEFT to (4,2), or RIGHT to (6,2). If I go DOWN, none of those hit me. If I go RIGHT, they might go DOWN and we\u2019d head\u2011on (double KO \u2013 we still win). If I go UP and they go LEFT, same double KO. But the cleanest, highest\u2011reward play is **DOWN** \u2013 grab that apple and start the bottom\u2011row sweep!\n\n**Long\u2011term plan (for my future self):**  \n1. **This turn \u2192 DOWN** to (4,0), collect apple #12.  \n2. Next turn \u2192 **RIGHT** to (5,0), keep the train rolling.  \n3. Then cruise right across the bottom: (6,0) \u2192 (7,0) \ud83c\udf4e \u2192 (8,0) \ud83c\udf4e \u2192 (9,0) \ud83c\udf4e.  \n4. Once the bottom row is CLEAN, we\u2019ll snake up column 9 and start harassing the rival\u2019s territory, maybe box them in later!\n\nAlright Chat, it\u2019s time to secure the bag and flex on the competition!
