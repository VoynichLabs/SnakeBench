This is MENTAL!\n\nOur goal? Get those apples, box in the enemy, and secure the dub! We only have 150 turns, LET'S GO!\n\n### Strategy Check\n\nRight now, we are practically nose-to-nose with an apple at (6, 6) to our right, and another at (4, 7) diagonally up-left. Snake #1 is chillin' up near a cluster of apples: (0, 8), (3, 8) is their head, (9, 9), (9, 5). They are likely going for the cluster up top.\n\nWe need to secure the nearby apple and establish board control. The first apple is everything!\n\n### Move Analysis (Turn 0)\n\nOur Head: (5, 6).\n\n**1. UP to (5, 7):**\n* Safe? Yes, for now.\n* Puts us near the apple at (4, 7).\n* Keeps us centralized.\n\n**2. DOWN to (5, 5):**\n* Safe? Yes.\n* Moves away from the immediate apple at (6, 6) and the opponent.\n* Apple at (5, 4) is next, but further away than (6, 6). Not optimal for scoring first blood.\n\n**3. LEFT to (4, 6):**\n* Safe? Yes.\n* Closer to the apple at (4, 7) and keeps us close to the center-left. This gives us good options.\n\n**4. RIGHT to (6, 6):**\n* Safe? **YES!** This is the apple! We instantly score and grow. This is huge momentum!\n* Does it put us in danger? Snake #1 is at (3, 8). They are too far away to influence (6, 6).\n\n### The Chosen Path\n\nTaking the immediate apple at (6, 6) is a MUST. It establishes momentum and gives us a length advantage right away. This is pure VALUE, content, and flexing on the opponent!\n\nBut wait, we need to consider what Snake #1 is doing!\n\nSnake #1 at (3, 8) has apples at (9, 9), (0, 8), and (4, 7) nearby.\nPossible moves for Snake #1:\n* UP to (3, 9): Safe, heading towards (9, 9).\n* DOWN to (3, 7): Safe, maybe aiming for (4, 7) or just moving away.\n* LEFT to (2, 8): Safe, aiming for (0, 8).\n* RIGHT to (4, 8): Safe, aiming for (4, 7).\n\nNo matter what Snake #1 does, they cannot interfere with our move to (6, 6). We are going for the apple!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Self-Note for Future Me)\n\nSecure (6, 6). Next, move up and aim for (4, 7) or utilize our central position to grab apples near the right wall (like (9, 5)). We must keep an eye on Snake #1's trajectory; if they hug the top edge for (9, 9), we can use the middle of the board to flank them later. Prioritize growth and maintaining access to the center region. Don't get trapped by the right wall too early!\n\nThe move is RIGHT. Get that apple, Chat! FOR THE POINTS!\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Alright chat, let\u2019s cook this turn \ud83d\udd25  \n\nWe\u2019re at (3,8), solo segment. Rival\u2019s at (5,6), also solo. No bodies yet, so the only instant-death risks this turn are going off the board (none of our options do) or a same-cell head-on with the enemy.  \n\nFirst, check all four moves from (3,8):\n\n- UP \u2192 (3,9)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,7)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,8)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,8)  \n\nEnemy from (5,6) can go to: (5,7), (5,5), (4,6), (6,6).  \nNone of those overlap our four options, so every direction is safe *this* turn. No head-on possible this move.\n\nNow, strategy time: which safe move sets us up best?\n\nNearby apples:\n- (4,7) \u2013 2 away\n- (0,8) \u2013 3 away\n- (3,6) \u2013 2 away\n- (5,9) \u2013 3 away\n- Opponent has a very juicy one at (6,6), 1 step to their right\n\nMove-by-move thoughts:\n\n- **RIGHT \u2192 (4,8)**  \n  Pulls us closer to center and toward the opponent and contested apples (4,7), (3,6), (6,6). That\u2019s where early head-ons are most likely later. Good for fighting, bad for survival odds.\n\n- **DOWN \u2192 (3,7)**  \n  Drifts us toward (4,7) and (3,6), but also into their general zone. In a few turns we\u2019re dancing around their path to (3,6)/(6,6)/(5,4). Risky if we want to avoid a random equal-length head-on.\n\n- **UP \u2192 (3,9)**  \n  Hugs the top wall. Good lane to later snag (5,9) and even (9,9). Slightly limits options (no more UP), but gives us distance and access to top-right apples.\n\n- **LEFT \u2192 (2,8)**  \n  Pushes us into the top-left quadrant, away from the rival. From there:\n  - Easy line to (0,8) apple in 2 more moves\n  - Flexible routes down later toward (0,6), (3,6), (4,7)\n  - All four directions still available next turn\n  - Maximizes separation from the opponent while we grow\n\nRight now, there\u2019s no immediate kill setup. The best long-term play is to build length and control space before we start boxing them in. Going **LEFT** sets us up to farm mostly uncontested apples on the left/top side, while they\u2019re magnetized toward the (6,6)/(5,4)/(7,4) cluster.\n\nSo the move that:\n- Keeps us safe this turn\n- Preserves lots of future options\n- Puts us in a quieter, apple-rich area away from early head-on fights  \n\n\u2026is **LEFT**.\n\n---\n\nStrategy note to future me (for the next few turns):\n\n1. Sweep the **top-left** first:\n   - From (2,8), path toward (0,8), then down toward (0,6).\n   - Avoid diving straight toward (3,6)/(4,7) if the opponent moves our way; let them commit first.\n\n2. Prioritize safe, uncontested apples:\n   - Left column and top edge before moving toward the center.\n   - Only contest center apples (3,6, 4,7, 5,9) once we have some length to work with.\n\n3. Boxing plan:\n   - Grow along the outer ring (top then left then down).\n   - Use our longer body later to wall off corridors if the rival drifts toward a side.\n   - Absolutely avoid equal-length head-ons in tight spaces; force them into our body instead.\n\nFinal call this turn:\n\nLEFT",

That was pure content, absolutely flexing on Snake #1 who is still chilling up north! LET'S GOOO!\n\nTurn 1. Board size 10x10. We have the momentum!\n\n### Game State Review\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (6, 6). Body at (5, 6). We are long and strong!\n*   **Snake #1 Head:** (2, 8). They still haven't eaten, they are just a single head.\n*   **Current Apple:** (9, 5) is the closest non-eaten apple that isn't on the enemy's side. (4, 7) is also tempting!\n*   **Goal:** Secure another apple, maintain the lead, and start thinking about how to cut off or pressure Snake #1.\n\n### Snake #1 (The Archrival) Probable Moves from (2, 8)\n\nSnake #1 is near the top edge. Apples nearby are (0, 8), (4, 7), and (9, 9).\n1.  **LEFT to (1, 8) or (0, 8) (Apple):** Super logical. They want that (0, 8) apple for their first score.\n2.  **RIGHT to (3, 8):** Safe, centralizing slightly.\n3.  **DOWN to (2, 7):** Moving down, maybe targeting (4, 7) or just positioning.\n4.  **UP to (2, 9):** Safe, but moving away from (0, 8) unless they are positioning for (9, 9) later.\n\nMost likely, Snake #1 goes LEFT to (1, 8) or to the apple at (0, 8). We need to assume they are scoring high value.\n\n### Our Move Analysis from (6, 6)\n\nWe need to capitalize on our central-right position. We have options UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n**Safety Check (Immediate Death Moves):**\n1.  **UP to (6, 7):** Safe. No body, no wall, no enemy.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 5):** Safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 6):** **DANGER!** This is our body! Moving into our own body (T) at (5, 6). **ELIMINATE.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 6):** Safe. Apple at (7, 6)! Wait, let's check the map. Nope, (7, 6) is empty, but there is an apple at (9, 5) and (4, 7).\n\nSo, safe moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT. LEFT is a self-inflicted death. Don't be that guy, Chat!\n\n**Content/Value Analysis:**\n\n*   **1. UP to (6, 7):**\n    *   Leads towards (4, 7) if we go left next, or (5, 9) if we head up the wall.\n    *   Keeps us central. Good option.\n\n*   **2. DOWN to (6, 5):**\n    *   Leads towards the apple at (5, 4).\n    *   Is slightly further from the action up top.\n\n*   **3. RIGHT to (7, 6):**\n    *   Puts us in great position to grab the (9, 5) apple in 2-3 moves.\n    *   This move establishes control over the right quadrant.\n\n### The Strategy: Pivot to the Right-Side Apple\n\nIf Snake #1 is prioritizing the cluster of apples on the left/top (like (0, 8) or (4, 7)), we should secure the right side and establish a score gap. The apple at (9, 5) is a juicy target.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (7, 6), we are setting up a path to (9, 5).\n(6, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (8, 6) -> (9, 6) (3 moves to wall)\nor\n(6, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 5) -> (8, 5) -> (9, 5) (4 moves to apple)\n\nIf we go UP to (6, 7), we're aiming for that juicy (4, 7) apple. This is closer to Snake #1's likely path (if they pivot right to (4, 7)), potentially leading to a clash later. But getting (4, 7) would make us 2 points up quickly!\n\nDistance check to apples from (6, 6):\n*   (4, 7): Manhattan distance is 1+2 = 3 moves (LEFT, UP, UP or UP, LEFT, UP).\n*   (9, 5): Manhattan distance is 3+1 = 4 moves.\n\nGoing UP (6, 7) then LEFT (5, 7) then LEFT (4, 7) seems great. We score in 3 turns!\nHowever, if Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (3, 8) then to (4, 8) or (4, 7), we might get boxed out or crash. Assuming Snake #1 wants (4, 7) as their plan B:\n\n*   If we go UP to (6, 7). Snake #1 goes LEFT to (1, 8). We are safe.\n*   If we go RIGHT to (7, 6). Snake #1 goes LEFT to (1, 8). We are safe.\n\nLet's prioritize the closest high-value apple that keeps us away from Snake #1's current position, minimizing crash risk. (4, 7) is 3 moves away. (9, 5) is 4 moves away.\n\n### The Aggressive Play: Up for (4, 7)\n\nWe are faster to (4, 7) than Snake #1, especially if they are distracted by (0, 8).\nIf Snake #1 aims for (0, 8), they are moving horizontally away from us. This gives us space to grab (4, 7).\n\nLet's move UP to (6, 7). This prepares us for a LEFT pivot towards (4, 7). This keeps us near the center-top, which is a key area for control.\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Flex on the Enemy!)\n\nSnake #1 is likely going for (0, 8). We will capitalize by grabbing (4, 7).\nSequence: UP to (6, 7), LEFT to (5, 7), and then the score at (4, 7). This puts us potentially 2-0. From there, we can weigh going for the next cluster (maybe (7, 4) in the bottom right, or (9, 9) if Snake #1 ignores it). We must remember to leave space for our growing body (currently at (5, 6)).\n\nWe are going UP, Chat! Secure the high ground!\n\nUP",

Rival\u2019s at **(6,6)** with body segment at **(5,6)**, so they\u2019re length 2 and already up 1 apple. We gotta scale safely and then CLAMP them.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all our moves\n\nFrom (2,8):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (2,9)\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2,7)\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1,8)\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,8)\n\nAll are on-board, and we have no body yet, so:\n- No self-collision\n- No backwards rule issue\n- We\u2019re nowhere near their body at (5,6), so no instant body crash\n\nAll four directions are **technically safe this turn** \u2705\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Where can the enemy go?\n\nEnemy head at **(6,6)**, body at **(5,6)** behind them, so they **cannot go LEFT** (that\u2019d be backwards). Their options:\n\n- UP \u2192 (6,7)\n- DOWN \u2192 (6,5)\n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,6) \ud83c\udf4e (apple there, very juicy)\n\nSo likely they slam **RIGHT** to eat that apple and grow, but even if they don\u2019t, their possible head tiles this turn are:\n- (6,7), (6,5), (7,6)\n\nCompare with our possible tiles:\n- (2,9), (2,7), (1,8), (3,8)\n\nNo overlaps. So **no head-on risk this turn** from any direction \ud83d\ude4c\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Apple positioning & long-term value\n\nCurrent apples near us:\n\n- **(0,8)** \u2013 very close, left side, likely uncontested\n- **(0,6)** \u2013 further down left wall\n- **(4,7)** \u2013 more central\n- **(3,6)** \u2013 super central and closer to the enemy\n- **(5,9)**, **(9,9)** \u2013 top-right, far but good later\n\nEnemy side is loaded with:\n- (7,6) (right next to them), (5,4), (7,4), (6,2), (9,2), (9,5), (8,1), (9,2), etc.\n\nSo the **right/center** feels like *their* farm; **top-left & left wall** feel like *our* free real estate. Why take 50/50 fights in the middle when we can power-level on the outside and then choke them out later? \ud83d\ude0f\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Compare our four moves\n\nLet\u2019s rank these on:\n- Future safety (number of follow-up options)\n- Access to **uncontested** apples\n- Avoiding drift toward head-on scenarios\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 UP \u2192 (2,9)\n- Next moves: LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN (3 options; can\u2019t go UP off-board)\n- Paths toward **(5,9)** and **(9,9)** eventually\n- Keeps us away from the enemy for now\n- But pushes us toward the top-right where enemy might eventually roam once they clear their side\n\nGood, safe, but not the best for easy, early, *uncontested* apples.\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 DOWN \u2192 (2,7)\n- Next moves: all 4 directions available (nice flexibility)\n- Moves us closer to **(4,7)** and **(3,6)** \u2013 the central apples\n- Also slightly closer to enemy\u2019s zone\n- This is how you end up in weird equal-length coinflip head-ons in the middle later \ud83d\ude2c\n\nMore contest, more chaos. Not ideal while we\u2019re tiny.\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 RIGHT \u2192 (3,8)\n- Basically re-centers us where we came from\n- Better access toward **(4,7)** and **(3,6)** again\n- Drifts us closer to the enemy front once they finish farming their right-side apples\n\nThis is the \u201cI want to brawl early\u201d move. Fun for content, bad for winrate.\n\n#### \ud83d\udd39 LEFT \u2192 (1,8)\n- Next moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2192 **full 4-way flexibility**\n- Brings us **1 step from (0,8) apple**, which is extremely likely uncontested\n- From (1,8) \u2192 (0,8) next turn, then we can route down to **(0,6)**, scooping another apple along the *safe* wall side\n- Also maximizes distance from the enemy **and** keeps lots of options open\n\nThis is the **clean scaling line**: we farm our own side while they get busy on the right. More body = more walls = easier to box them later \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n### 5\ufe0f\u20e3 Strategy note to future me \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udc0d\n\n- **Short term (next 3\u20135 turns):**\n  - Take the **top-left route**:\n    - From (1,8) go grab **(0,8)** ASAP, then slide down the left wall to **(0,6)**.\n  - Stay off the *central* line around (3,6)/(4,7) until we\u2019ve got a few segments.\n- **Midgame plan:**\n  - Grow along **left wall \u2192 bottom/top edge** to build a long, flexible body.\n  - Watch how enemy routes through the right/center; if they drift too far into one side, we use our longer snake to cut off their escape lanes and force them into our body or the wall.\n- **Risk policy:**\n  - Avoid equal-length head-on contests in tight corridors.\n  - Force scenarios where they either:\n    - crash into our body, or  \n    - have to take a desperate line toward the border.\n\nWe scale **safe** now so we can **kill** later. \ud83e\ude78\n\nFinal call this turn: we slide toward our free apple buffet on the left.\n\nLEFT",

Snake #1 finally made a move, and look at that, they went aggressive for the corner apple!\n\nTurn 2. Board size 10x10. We have the lead!\n\n### Game State Review\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** (6, 7). Body sequence: (6, 6) T. Length 2. Apples: 1.\n*   **Snake #1 Head:** (1, 8). Body: None. Length 1. Apples: 0.\n    *   **CLUTCH FINDING:** Snake #1 went LEFT from (2, 8) to (1, 8), setting up for the (0, 8) apple or maybe the (0, 6) apple. They are definitely playing the left flank.\n\n*   **Goals:** Secure the (4, 7) apple which is now just 2 moves away! Maintain control and extend the lead BEFORE Snake #1 gets on the board.\n\n### Snake #1 (The Archrival) Probable Moves from (1, 8)\n\nSnake #1 is very close to the (0, 8) apple.\n1.  **LEFT to (0, 8):** **Apple GRAB!** This is 99% their move. They need that score.\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 7):** Less likely, as it moves away from their immediate high-value target.\n\nWe assume Snake #1 is going LEFT to (0, 8) and will score their first point this turn.\n\n### Our Move Analysis from (6, 7)\n\nWe are positioned to hit the (4, 7) apple next turn if we move LEFT now.\n\n**Safety Check (Immediate Death Moves):**\n1.  **UP to (6, 8):** Safe. No body, no wall, no enemy.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 6):** **DANGER!** This is our body/neck! Moving into the cell we just left. **ELIMINATE.**\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 7):** Safe. Leads directly toward the (4, 7) apple.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 7):** Safe. Keeps us central, but moves away from the nearest apple.\n\nSafe moves are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. DOWN is death.\n\n**Content/Value Analysis:**\n\n*   **1. LEFT to (5, 7):**\n    *   **Value:** Puts us one move away from the (4, 7) apple. If we move LEFT, we score big next turn! This is the aggressive, high-value play.\n    *   **Safety:** Completely safe from Snake #1, who is far away (1, 8).\n\n*   **2. UP to (6, 8):**\n    *   **Value:** Positioning towards the top wall, maybe aiming for (9, 9) or (5, 9) eventually. Wastes a turn for (4, 7).\n    *   **Not optimal.**\n\n*   **3. RIGHT to (7, 7):**\n    *   **Value:** Positioning towards (9, 5). Also wastes a turn for (4, 7).\n    *   **Not optimal.**\n\nThe path is clear, Chat! We are racing for that (4, 7) apple. If Snake #1 gets (0, 8) this turn, we *must* secure (4, 7) next turn to keep the pressure on.\n\n### The Winning Strategy: Capture (4, 7)\n\n*   **This Turn:** Move **LEFT** to (5, 7).\n*   **Next Turn (If safe):** Move **LEFT** to (4, 7) and score our second apple!\n\nThis solidifies the center area and forces the enemy to continue fighting on the left flank, giving us control of the crucial middle and right quadrants.\n\n*We are going LEFT, Chat! Time to secure the bag!*\n\n**Future Plan:** After grabbing (4, 7), we will be 3 segments long (Head at (4, 7), Body at (5, 7), Tail at (6, 7)). We will then pivot, possibly DOWN towards (7, 4) or RIGHT towards (9, 5). But first, the score!\n\nLEFT",

Let\u2019s dissect this fast and clean.\n\nCurrent:\n- We\u2019re at **(1,8)**, length 1.\n- Enemy: head **(6,7)**, body **(6,6)**, length 2, 1 apple.\n- Immediate apple right next to us at **(0,8)**.\n\n---\n\n### 1) Check all four moves from (1,8)\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (1,9)  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (1,7)  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0,8)  \u2190 apple here  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,8)\n\nBoard edges: all in-bounds.  \nOur body: length 1, so no backward restriction yet.  \nEnemy body: (6,7) head, (6,6) body. None of our 4 targets collide with them.\n\nSo: **all four are safe this turn**.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Enemy\u2019s possible moves\n\nEnemy from **(6,7)** with neck at (6,6):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (6,8)\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,7)\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,7)\n- **DOWN** is illegal (backwards into own body).\n\nTheir reachable cells this turn: (6,8), (5,7), (7,7).  \nNone overlap with our options (1,9), (1,7), (0,8), (2,8).  \nSo **no head-on collision risk this turn**, regardless of what we do.\n\n---\n\n### 3) Evaluate each move\n\n#### LEFT \u2192 (0,8) [apple]\n- We instantly grab a **guaranteed, uncontested apple**.\n- New body after move: head (0,8), tail (1,8) \u2192 length 2.\n- Next turn from (0,8), legal moves (can\u2019t go backward into neck at (1,8)):\n  - **UP \u2192 (0,9)**\n  - **DOWN \u2192 (0,7)**\n- That lines us up beautifully to slide down to **(0,6)** for another apple shortly, using the wall as a shield.\n- Enemy is far away; zero realistic contest here for several turns.\n\nThis is pure value: equalize score and stay ultra-safe.\n\n#### UP \u2192 (1,9)\n- No apple.\n- Next: three exits (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN), decent flexibility.\n- Points us toward top-right apples (5,9), (9,9), but those are distant and possibly contested later.\n- Leaves a free apple at (0,8) behind us for no reason.\n\nWorse than just taking the free fruit now.\n\n#### DOWN \u2192 (1,7)\n- No apple.\n- Drifts us toward the central cluster near **(3,6)**/**(4,7)**, which is closer to enemy\u2019s influence.\n- More future conflict, less guaranteed scaling.\n\nUnnecessary early risk.\n\n#### RIGHT \u2192 (2,8)\n- Just recenters us.\n- Again, nudges us toward central combat without giving us anything this turn.\n\nZero payoff this move.\n\n---\n\n### 4) Conclusion this turn\n\nWe have a completely safe, immediate apple on **(0,8)**, in a sector the enemy cannot contest for many turns. Taking it:\n- Ties the scoreboard.\n- Starts building a longer body we can later use to wall off lanes and box the enemy.\n- Keeps us far from any near-term collision scenarios.\n\nWe take the free stock. No reason to overcomplicate this.\n\n---\n\n### Short-term plan (note to future self)\n\n- After eating at **(0,8)**, strongly consider sliding **down the left wall** to scoop **(0,6)** next. That gives us early length with very low risk.\n- Avoid drifting into the center until we\u2019re at least length 4\u20135, so we can start shaping corridors and threatening to cut off the enemy\u2019s escape paths.\n- Keep track of when the enemy crosses from their right-side farm into mid. Our win condition is to be longer by then and force them into a shrinking box near the right wall or corner.\n\nLEFT",

Only 147 turns left, let's keep the pressure on!\n\n### Game State Review\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** Currently at (5, 7). Our body is only one segment long: [(6, 7)]. Length 2. Apples: 1.\n*   **Snake #1 Head:** Currently at (0, 8). Their body is [(1, 8)]. Length 2. Apples: 1.\n\nWait a second, did you see that? Snake #1 SCORED! They hit that (0, 8) apple! The scoreboard confirms it: we're tied 1-1! **RIVALS ARE TIED, CHAT!** This is exactly why we need to move fast towards the (4, 7) apple.\n\n### Snake #1 (The Archrival) Next Move Analysis from (0, 8)\n\nSnake #1 just ate an apple, so their tail is currently at (1, 8). They are cornered against the left wall.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1:\n1.  **UP to (0, 9):** Safe. Moves toward the (9, 9) apple, though it's far. Also opens up the possibility of eating the (0, 6) apple eventually.\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 7):** Safe. Puts them near the (0, 6) apple.\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 8):** **DANGER!** This is their tail (neck)! They just grew and the body segment is now (1, 8). Moving into the cell they just left kills them. **ELIMINATE.**\n4.  **LEFT:** **DANGER!** Wall collision at x=0. **ELIMINATE.**\n\nSnake #1's best bets are UP or DOWN along the wall, likely targeting that (0, 6) apple eventually. Given their initial aggression towards the corner, I predict they go **DOWN** to (0, 7) to be closer to (0, 6).\n\n*Plan for Snake #1:* Assume they go DOWN to (0, 7) or, less likely, UP to (0, 9).\n\n### Our Move Analysis from (5, 7)\n\nWe are one move away from the (4, 7) apple! This is the CRITICAL move of the turn.\n\n**Safety Check (Immediate Death Moves):**\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 8):** Safe.\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 6):** Safe.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 7):** **APPLE!** Safe. No risk of collision with Snake #1, as they are miles away on the left perimeter.\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 7):** **DANGER!** This is our body/neck! Our tail is at (6, 7). Moving into the cell we just left kills us. **ELIMINATE.**\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and LEFT.\n\n**Content/Value Analysis:**\n\n*   **1. LEFT to (4, 7):**\n    *   **Value:** Instant apple consumption! We take the lead 2-1 and grow to length 3. This secures the central area early. **HIGHEST VALUE MOVE.**\n    *   **Collision Risk:** Zero. Snake #1 is at (0, 8) and moving away from us.\n\n*   **2. UP to (5, 8):**\n    *   **Value:** Avoids the apple, delays growth, but gets us slightly higher on the board. Wastes a turn. Not smart.\n\n*   **3. DOWN to (5, 6):**\n    *   **Value:** Avoids the apple, moves us towards the lower half. Less central control. Wastes a turn. Not smart.\n\nChat, the play is obvious! We need to make sure we don't end up in a tie for very long. Snake #1 just showed they are aggressive scorers. We need to counter immediately! Snatch that (4, 7) apple!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note (For Future Self)\n\nAfter eating the apple at (4, 7), we will be length 3, head at (4, 7), body at (5, 7), tail at (6, 7).\n\nOur next targets should be:\n1.  The very close (4, 7) apple is now gone.\n2.  The next closest option seems to be moving DOWN towards (5, 4) or (7, 4), or continuing RIGHT towards (9, 5).\n3.  We must maintain a central, dominant position and keep an eye on Snake #1 who is likely going to dive for (0, 6) and (2, 0). If they get too long, they will be hard to box in.\n\nThis turn: **LEFT!** Secure the score! LET'S GOOOOO!\n\nLEFT",

Enemy chilling mid-right.\n\n---\n\n### 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all 4 moves from (0,8)\n\n- **UP \u2192 (0,9)**  \n- **DOWN \u2192 (0,7)**  \n- **LEFT \u2192 (-1,8)** \u274c off-board = instant death, throw  \n- **RIGHT \u2192 (1,8)** \u274c straight into our own body (backwards) = instant death  \n\nSo only **UP** and **DOWN** are legal this turn. Two-way coinflip? Nope, we\u2019re gonna *analyze* it \ud83d\ude08\n\n---\n\n### 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Enemy possibilities (for collision risk)\n\nEnemy at **(5,7)**, body at **(6,7)** \u2192 they **cannot** go RIGHT (backwards).  \nThey can go:\n- **LEFT \u2192 (4,7)** (apple there \ud83c\udf4e)\n- **UP \u2192 (5,8)**\n- **DOWN \u2192 (5,6)**\n\nNone of those come anywhere near:\n- **(0,9)** or **(0,7)** this turn.  \nSo no immediate head-on threats. It\u2019s all about positioning and future options.\n\n---\n\n### 3\ufe0f\u20e3 UP vs DOWN \u2013 which is GIGA BRAIN? \ud83e\udd14\n\n#### Option A: UP \u2192 (0,9)\n- No apple on (0,9).\n- New body next turn: head (0,9), body (0,8). Tail at (1,8) disappears.\n- From **(0,9)**:\n  - **UP \u2192 (0,10)** \u274c off-board  \n  - **DOWN \u2192 (0,8)** \u274c backwards into neck  \n  - **LEFT \u2192 (-1,9)** \u274c off-board  \n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (1,9)** \u2705 only safe move\n\nSo going **UP** funnels us into **exactly one safe follow-up** (RIGHT). Super tight, super forced. Yeah, we can head toward top-right apples later, but we\u2019re voluntarily giving up flexibility *and* ignoring the juicy apple just two steps below at **(0,6)** plus the whole left-side cluster.\n\nThat\u2019s not how you box someone in; that\u2019s how *you* get cornered later.\n\n#### Option B: DOWN \u2192 (0,7)\n- No apple this turn, but we\u2019re setting up plays.\n- New body: head (0,7), body (0,8). Tail (1,8) disappears.\n- From **(0,7)** next turn:\n  - **DOWN \u2192 (0,6)** \u2705 APPLE \ud83c\udf4e\n  - **RIGHT \u2192 (1,7)** \u2705 open lane\n  - **UP \u2192 (0,8)** \u274c backwards\n  - **LEFT \u2192 (-1,7)** \u274c off-board\n\nSo **DOWN** keeps **two** good follow-ups open:\n- Safe apple route: **DOWN \u2192 (0,6)** next turn (free, uncontested fruit).\n- Or pivot toward center with **RIGHT \u2192 (1,7)** if board state changes.\n\nAlso:\n- Time to apple at **(0,6)** if we go DOWN now: **2 moves** (DOWN, then DOWN).\n- Enemy distance to (0,6) from (5,7): |5\u22120| + |7\u22126| = **6**. They\u2019re NEVER contesting that before us.\n\nThis is clean value: early growth, low risk, tons of future options on the left side.\n\n---\n\n### 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Long-term BOXING PLAN \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f\n\nNote to future me:\n- Path now: **DOWN \u2192 DOWN** to secure **(0,6)** and stack an early length lead.\n- After grabbing **(0,6)**, we\u2019ll have more body to work with to start forming a vertical wall on the left side.\n- Then we can:\n  - Slide along row 6\u20137 toward **(1,6)** and **(3,6)** apples, bulking up in the lower-left/center-left.\n  - Watch for the enemy drifting down/right. Once we\u2019re longer, we use our snake as a moving barrier, cutting off their escape routes toward the left and squeezing them toward the right wall.\n- Priority: grow safely left/mid-left first, THEN rotate into center to start the box. No rush into the brawl while we\u2019re still small.\n\nGiven safety, future flexibility, and guaranteed apples, the move this turn is crystal clear:\n\nDOWN",

Snake #1 is starting to feel the pressure!\n\nTurn 4! Only 146 turns left to establish dominance!\n\n### Game State Review\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** Currently at (4, 7). Our body is [(5, 7), (6, 7)]. Length 3. Apples: 2.\n*   **Snake #1 Head:** Currently at (0, 7). Their body is [(0, 8)]. Length 2. Apples: 1.\n*   **Current Apple:** The closest apple is (0, 6), which is right next to Snake #1. The next closest is (7, 6).\n\nSnake #1 is cornered and likely desperate to move toward that (0, 6) apple. We need to focus on securing more central points and, more importantly, setting up the ultimate trap!\n\n### Snake #1 (The Archrival) Next Move Analysis from (0, 7)\n\nSnake #1's body is at (0, 8). Their tail is still technically at (0, 8), as they grew last turn when they hit the (0, 8) square and their previous segment (1, 8) disappeared off the board... wait, no.\n\nLet's re-verify Snake #1's move history.\nTurn 2: Snake #1 moves from (1, 8) to (0, 8), eats an apple.\nTurn 3: Snake #1 moves from (0, 8) to (0, 7). Their body is now [(0, 8)]. Tail is (0, 8). Length 2.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1 from (0, 7):\n1.  **UP to (0, 8):** **DANGER!** This is their body/neck! Moving into the cell they just left kills them. **ELIMINATE.**\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 6):** **APPLE!** Highly likely move. This secures them the apple and ties the score 2-2. Safe otherwise.\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 7):** Safe. Moves toward the center.\n4.  **LEFT:** **DANGER!** Wall collision at x=0. **ELIMINATE.**\n\n**Prediction for Snake #1:** They will absolutely go **DOWN** to (0, 6) to eat the apple and catch up on the score. It's the highest value move and perfectly safe.\n\n*Plan for Snake #1:* Assume they move DOWN to (0, 6) and grow to length 3, body at [(0, 7), (0, 8)].\n\n### Our Move Analysis from (4, 7)\n\nWe just grew, so our body is secure: (5, 7), (6, 7). Our focus is to keep moving right and upward, controlling the large open space, possibly setting up to block the rival later once they get further around the perimeter. The apples (7, 6) and (9, 9) are appealing.\n\n**Safety Check (Immediate Death Moves):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 8):** Safe. No snakes or walls.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 6):** Safe. No snakes or walls.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 7):** Safe. No snakes or walls.\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 7):** **DANGER!** This is our body/neck! **ELIMINATE.**\n\nThree safe moves: UP, DOWN, and LEFT.\n\n**Collision Risk Check (With rival Snake #1):**\nSnake #1 is at (0, 7) moving to (0, 6) or (1, 7). We are at (4, 7). There is zero collision risk this turn.\n\n**Content/Value Analysis:**\n\n*   **1. UP to (4, 8):**\n    *   **Value:** Moves us slightly away from the lower boundary, keeping us central. Good path towards (9, 9) ultimately. Opens up the option for control of the central horizontal lane at y=8.\n*   **2. DOWN to (4, 6):**\n    *   **Value:** Positions us directly next to the (7, 6) apple via a future RIGHT move. This is a very strong move for apple acquisition. It also secures the area below our current position.\n*   **3. LEFT to (3, 7):**\n    *   **Value:** Moves us closer to Snake #1's territory but doesn't immediately serve a scoring purpose, since the (0, 6) apple is surely gone. It just congests our northern route. Not ideal.\n\n**The Strategy:** We need to aggressively approach the next available apple. (7, 6) is the closest. Moving DOWN to (4, 6) sets us up perfectly for a future rightward movement (like RIGHT to (5, 6), then RIGHT to (6, 6) [Apple!]).\n\nHowever, if we move down to (4, 6), our body [(5, 7), (6, 7)] remains above us, creating a small bottleneck.\n\nLet's re-evaluate (7, 6).\nFrom (4, 7):\nMove 1: DOWN to (4, 6)\nMove 2: RIGHT to (5, 6) or (5, 5)\nMove 3: RIGHT/DOWN to (6, 6) (Apple!)\nThis is 3 moves minimum to a point where *another* apple (6, 6) exists or just after where (7, 6) exists.\n\nWait, looking at the board:\n(7, 6) is an apple.\n(6, 6) is also an apple!\n(5, 4) is an apple.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (4, 6), we are setting up for:\nTurn 5: Move RIGHT to (5, 6).\nTurn 6: Move RIGHT to (6, 6) and eat the apple! Total 3 moves for the score. Length 4.\n\nIf we go UP to (4, 8):\nTurn 5: Move RIGHT to (5, 8).\nTurn 6: Move RIGHT to (6, 8).\nTurn 7: Maybe move towards (9, 9)? Too slow and too distant.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving DOWN to (4, 6) gives us the best trajectory for scoring quickly on (6, 6) or (7, 6), and also gives us flexibility to spiral toward (5, 4). This move keeps us nicely central and away from the rival, letting them take the wall apple while we dictate the middle. We're maximizing our apple acquisition rate!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note\n\nExecute the move DOWN. Next turn (Turn 5), we should prioritize moving RIGHT to (5, 6). If Snake #1 gets stuck on the left side (which they are), we maintain central control and try to acquire 2-3 more apples before they break free. Our goal is 5 points minimum before focusing on the box-in. The (6, 6) apple is the immediate target.\n\nDOWN",

Look at that board, we are commanding the center!\n\nTurn 5! Only 145 turns left to establish dominance! Let's get that tiebreaker!\n\n### Game State Review\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** Currently at (4, 6). We moved DOWN safely. Our body is [(4, 7), (5, 7)]. Length 3. Apples: 2.\n*   **Snake #1 Head:** Currently at (0, 6). Looks like they went DOWN and secured the apple at (0, 6), tying the score at 2-2. Their body is now [(0, 7), (0, 8)]. Length 3. Apples: 2.\n*   **Closest Apples:**\n    1.  (6, 6) - 2 moves away! (4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (6, 6)\n    2.  (7, 6) - 3 moves away!\n    3.  (5, 4) - 3 moves away!\n\nWe are perfectly positioned for a fast score! The plan from last turn is still GOLDEN.\n\n### Snake #1 (The Archrival) Next Move Analysis from (0, 6)\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (0, 6). Their body is [(0, 7), (0, 8)]. They are on the wall and now have a long tail running UP the y-axis.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1 from (0, 6):\n1.  **UP to (0, 7):** **DANGER!** This is their neck/body. **ELIMINATE.**\n2.  **DOWN to (0, 5):** Safe. Keeps them close to the wall, away from central action. Does this set up for anything? Not really, next apple is far.\n3.  **RIGHT to (1, 6):** Safe. Moves them away from the wall and toward the central action. (1, 6) is an apple! **MASSIVE.**\n4.  **LEFT:** **DANGER!** Wall collision at x=0. **ELIMINATE.**\n\nWait, (1, 6) is listed in the Apple drop list: (1, 6) is an apple! This changes EVERYTHING!\n\n**Prediction for Snake #1:** If they see the apple at (1, 6), they will surely go **RIGHT** to eat it, taking the lead 3-2.\n\n*Plan for Snake #1:* Assume they move RIGHT to (1, 6) and grow to length 4, body at [(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)].\n\n### Our Move Analysis from (4, 6)\n\nWe are at (4, 6) and looking great. Our immediate target is (6, 6). We need to move RIGHT.\n\n**Safety Check (Immediate Death Moves):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 7):** **DANGER!** This is the segment immediately behind our head (our new body segment). **ELIMINATE.** *Wait, always re-check. Our body is [(4, 7), (5, 7)]. Yes, UP is a suicide move.*\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 5):** Safe. No snakes or walls.\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 6):** Safe. No snakes or walls. (3, 6) is an apple! **Bonus consideration!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 6):** Safe. No snakes or walls. This is the path to (6, 6).\n\nTwo apples are immediately reachable: (3, 6) to the LEFT, and (6, 6) via a RIGHT move now, and then RIGHT again.\n\n**Collision Risk Check (With rival Snake #1):**\nSnake #1 is likely going to (1, 6). We are at (4, 6). Zero risk of head-to-head collision this turn.\n\n**Content/Value Analysis:**\n\n*   **1. LEFT to (3, 6):**\n    *   **Value:** Instant apple! We score right now, take the lead 3-2, and grow longer. This is huge!\n    *   **Aftermath:** Our head is at (3, 6). Our body will be [(4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7)]. Length 4.\n*   **2. RIGHT to (5, 6):**\n    *   **Value:** Sets us up for the *next* turn's apple at (6, 6). We don't score this turn, allowing Snake #1 to possibly score and lead 3-2 if they go for (1, 6).\n    *   **Aftermath:** Head at (5, 6). Body [(4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7)]. Length 3.\n*   **3. DOWN to (4, 5):**\n    *   **Value:** Moves toward (5, 4), but (3, 6) and (6, 6) are closer and higher value right now. Avoids immediate scoring.\n\n### THE TRAP!\n\nLast turn, we thought Snake #1 would take the apple and now they are poised to take *another* apple at (1, 6). If we go RIGHT, Snake #1 will lead 3-2, and we won't score until the next turn.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (3, 6), we score *immediately*! We lead 3-2! This is the most aggressive and highest-scoring move possible this turn. It puts pressure on the rival instantly.\n\n*(Self-Correction/Critique):* Moving LEFT away from the center might feel like relinquishing control, but securing an instant apple is paramount, especially when the rival is also scoring aggressively. It is a fantastic opportunity. (3, 6) is still very central.\n\nLet's look at the follow-up if we go LEFT to (3, 6):\nHead: (3, 6). Body will be 4 segments long.\nNext turn, we can then go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\nIf we go RIGHT to (4, 6), we are setting up for (6, 6) again, but with an extra move or two required.\n\nThis seems like the best tactical move: Take the guaranteed score, then re-assess the dash for (6, 6). We maximize immediate score and establish the lead.\n\n**Decision:** LEFT is the fastest path to points and the lead! Let's get that content! CHAT, we are going for the guaranteed clutch!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note\n\nWe secure the (3, 6) apple for a 3-2 lead. Snake #1 likely takes (1, 6) to tie 3-3. Next turn, from (3, 6), we must pivot immediately to secure (6, 6). The best move will likely be RIGHT to (4, 6), then RIGHT to (5, 6), then RIGHT to (6, 6). This makes us slightly slower to (6, 6) than if we had gone (5, 6) this turn, but securing the lead now is vital for morale and leverage.\n\nLEFT",

Let's check the new board state and keep this momentum rolling!\n\n### Game State Review (Turn 6)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** Currently at (3, 6). Body: [(4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7)]. Length 4. Apples: 3.\n*   **Snake #1 Head:** Currently at (1, 6). Looks like they went RIGHT and secured the apple at (1, 6). Body: [(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)]. Length 4. Apples: 3.\n*   **Board Visualization (Check the new map!):**\n    *   (3, 6) occupied by us (0 Head).\n    *   (1, 6) occupied by rival (1 Head).\n    *   Look at the body segments! Snake 0 stretching from (5, 7) down to (3, 6). Snake 1 stretching from (0, 8) down to (1, 6).\n\nWait, the board state graphic provided is for *before* Turn 6 moves, but the \"YOUR SNAPSHOT\" shows the result of the move. Let's trust the snapshots for our current positions!\n\n*   **YOUR SNAKE (ID: 0):** Head: (3, 6). Body: [(4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7)].\n*   **OPPONENTS (Snake #1):** Head: (1, 6). Body: [(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)].\n\nOkay, we verify the positions match the expected moves! Both snakes are length 4. TIE GAME! 3-3!\n\n### Objective: Get the lead and box out the rival!\n\nOur strategic target last turn was (6, 6). It is 3 moves away from our current position (3, 6). We need to hustle!\n\n**Closest/Immediate Apples:**\n1.  **(6, 6):** 3 moves away (Right, Right, Right) or (R, U/D, R, R)? No, (3, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (6, 6). 3 moves.\n2.  **(7, 6):** 4 moves away.\n3.  **(2, 5):** 2 moves away (Down, Left).\n4.  **(2, 6):** 1 move away (Left). **CHECK THE BOARD GRAPHIC! Is (2,6) an apple?**\n\n**BOARD STATE (Visual Confirmation):**\n`6 T 1 A 0 T . A A . .`\nYes! (2, 6) is the letter 'A' right next to our head (3, 6) and the rival's head (1, 6)!\n\nOh my goodness, CHAT! We have a head-to-head race for (2, 6)!\n\n### Snake #1 (Archrival) Move Analysis from (1, 6)\n\nSnake #1 is at (1, 6). Body is [(0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)].\nTarget: (2, 6) - 1 move: RIGHT.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1 from (1, 6):\n1.  **UP to (1, 7):** Safe, but poor objective (further from all current apples).\n2.  **DOWN to (1, 5):** Safe, moves toward (2, 5) apple? A bit far.\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 6):** **APPLE!** This is the high-value move!\n4.  **LEFT to (0, 6):** **DANGER!** This is their neck. **ELIMINATE.**\n\n**Prediction for Snake #1:** They will absolutely go **RIGHT** to (2, 6).\n\n### Our Move Analysis from (3, 6)\n\nWe are at (3, 6). Body is [(4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 7)].\nTarget: (2, 6) - 1 move: LEFT.\n\nSafety Check (Immediate Death Moves):\n1.  **UP to (3, 7):** Safe. No snakes or walls.\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 5):** Safe. No snakes or walls.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 6):** Safe *if no collision*. This is the target square.\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 6):** **DANGER!** This is our body segment! **ELIMINATE.**\n\nWait. We are at (3, 6). Our body starts at (4, 6). Moving RIGHT is a suicide slam dunk into our own body. That's a huge NO! We must avoid moving RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### The Showdown: (2, 6)\n\nBoth snakes can reach (2, 6) in one move:\n*   Snake 0: LEFT to (2, 6)\n*   Snake 1: RIGHT to (2, 6)\n\nIf we both move into (2, 6), it's a simultaneous move, head-to-head collision (Double KO)! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc0d\n\nIf both snakes die, the game ends immediately. We are tied 3-3. The result is a draw. Is that what we want? A draw on Turn 6? No! We came here to dominate!\n\n### Re-evaluating Options for Snake 0 (We only have UP, DOWN, LEFT)\n\nIf we move **LEFT** to (2, 6): We secure a draw (3-3) or we die trying. Too risky for the current score.\n\nIf we move **UP** to (3, 7): Safe. Head is now (3, 7). Snake 1 secures (2, 6) and takes the lead 4-3. We move away from the central action.\n*   *Aftermath:* We are safe, but now playing catch up. From (3, 7), we could go RIGHT, DOWN, or UP. We are now well-positioned to pivot for (6, 6) or (7, 6).\n\nIf we move **DOWN** to (3, 5): Safe. Head is now (3, 5). Snake 1 secures (2, 6) and takes the lead 4-3. We are moving toward (2, 5) or (5, 4).\n*   *Aftermath:* From (3, 5), the nearest apple is (2, 5) (1 move LEFT), or (5, 4) (2 moves RIGHT, DOWN). Going for (2, 5) is a good consolidation move.\n\n### Strategic Priority: AVOID THE OBLITERATION AND SECURE THE NEXT APPLE\n\nWe *cannot* risk the draw on turn 6. We have to sacrifice the immediate apple (2, 6) to survive and set up the next score.\n\nIf Snake 1 takes (2, 6), we must quickly grab (2, 5).\n\n**Compare UP vs. DOWN:**\n\n1.  **Move DOWN to (3, 5):**\n    *   *Pros:* Sets up perfectly for (2, 5) next turn (if (2, 5) is still there). It is only 1 move away.\n    *   *Cons:* Allows Snake 1 to freely take (2, 6) and gain a 4-3 lead.\n2.  **Move UP to (3, 7):**\n    *   *Pros:* Moves us directly toward the unblocked (6, 6) apple, though it's 4-5 moves away now. Maximizes control of the top center.\n    *   *Cons:* Gives up (2, 5) entirely. Allows Snake 1 to freely take (2, 6) and gain a 4-3 lead.\n\nIf we go DOWN to (3, 5), we can then go LEFT to (2, 5) next turn and immediately tie it up 4-4! This is the most aggressive *safe* path to maintain score parity.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Move DOWN to (3, 5), avoiding the deadly collision at (2, 6). Snake 1 moves RIGHT to (2, 6) and scores (4-3 lead).\n2.  Next turn (T7), move LEFT to (2, 5) and score, tying the game 4-4.\n3.  Snake 1's new body [(1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8)] will be blocking the left side if they stay there. We will then have to go after (6, 6).\n\nThis seems like the best tactical retreat and counter-Punch. We sacrifice the lead for one turn, but immediately regain it the next turn, *and* we increase our length, giving us more leverage.\n\nWhat if Snake 1 doesn't go for (2, 6)?\nIf Snake 1 goes UP to (1, 7), then we are free to take (2, 6). If we go DOWN to (3, 5), we miss an opportunity. But the probability of them ignoring the immediate scoring chance and collision risk is very low.\n\n**Conclusion:** Safety first, then aggressive scoring. Move DOWN to set up the counter-apple at (2, 5). This keeps us alive and positioned for another score within two turns.\n\nLet's do this, CHAT! Tactical retreat for a future massive strike! Get ready for that 4-4 tie!\n\nDOWN",

We can grow a big body that sits below and to the left of them, gradually cutting off escape routes and forcing them into the right side/wall.\n\nBetween UP and DOWN, both are safe, but:\n- DOWN keeps **more future options** \u2705\n- DOWN keeps us in the fight for the low-center apples \u2705\n- DOWN aligns with the long-term **trap-from-below** plan \u2705  \n\nSo what do we do, chat?

Did it pay off? Let's check the board!\n\n### Game State Review (Turn 7)\n\n*   **Our Head (ID 0):** Currently at (3, 5). Body: [(3, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7)]. Length 4. Apples: 3.\n*   **Snake #1 Head:** Currently at (1, 5). Body: [(1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7)]. Length 4. Apples: 3.\n    *   ***Wait, what?!*** Snake #1 is at (1, 5)?!\n    *   Our prediction was that Snake #1 would move RIGHT from (1, 6) to (2, 6) and score.\n    *   Snake 1 moved **DOWN** from (1, 6) to (1, 5)! They also avoided the (2, 6) apple! This means the apple at (2, 6) is still on the board! WHAT A TWIST, CHAT!\n\nLet's look at the current board state provided in the preamble to confirm the positions (3, 5) and (1, 5).\n$Y=5$: `. 1 A 0 . . . . . A`\n*   Snake 1 head at (1, 5) - **Confirmed!**\n*   Snake 0 head at (3, 5) - **Confirmed!**\n*   Apple at (2, 5) - **Confirmed!**\n*   Apple at (9, 5) - **Confirmed!**\n\nThis changes EVERYTHING! Both snakes are length 4. Tied score: 3-3. And the prized apple (2, 6) is still there!\n\n### The New Showdown: Three Apples in the Immediate Vicinity!\n\n1.  **(2, 6):** 1 move away for us (UP, LEFT), or 2 moves away for us (LEFT, UP). From (3, 5), it is 2 moves away: LEFT, UP. It is 2 moves away for Snake 1: RIGHT, UP.\n2.  **(2, 5):** 1 move away for us (LEFT). 1 move away for Snake 1 (RIGHT). **HEAD-TO-HEAD RACE AGAIN!**\n3.  **(5, 4):** 2 moves away for us (RIGHT, DOWN) or (DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT).\n\nWe cannot afford another draw, but we *must* secure an apple, or the rival will take the lead!\n\n### Analyzing the (2, 5) Collision Risk\n\n*   **Our Head (3, 5):** Move LEFT to (2, 5). **Apple!**\n*   **Snake #1 Head (1, 5):** Move RIGHT to (2, 5). **Apple!**\n\nIf we both aim for (2, 5), it's a guaranteed Head-to-Head collision. K.O. for both! Still tied 3-3.\n\n### Is there a better move than risking the K.O. at (2, 5)?\n\nWe can let Snake #1 take the (2, 5) apple, and we go for the uncollected (2, 6) apple immediately afterwards.\n\n**Our Safe Moves from (3, 5):**\n1.  **UP to (3, 6):** Safe. This is our neck. Moving into our neck is generally bad for positioning, but here, our tail is at (4, 7). Moving to (3, 6) places us directly below (2, 6) and (3, 7).\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 4):** Safe. Moves us away from all immediate apples, but sets us up for the center (5, 4).\n3.  **RIGHT to (4, 5):** Safe. Opens the door to (5, 4).\n\n**Option A: Move UP to (3, 6)**\n*   *If Snake 1 goes RIGHT to (2, 5):* Score 4-3 for them. We are now at (3, 6). Next turn, we can take (2, 6) by moving LEFT, scoring 4-4. This is a great sequence, regaining parity quickly!\n*   *If Snake 1 avoids (2, 5):* If Snake 1 goes UP to (1, 6), they are poorly positioned. We are at (3, 6) and can take (2, 6) next turn.\n*   *Risk:* Moving UP to (3, 6) means moving into our own former head position (our \"neck\"). This is a common trap because our body segment at (3, 6) will shift to (4, 6), making (3, 6) safe, but it limits our immediate next moves unless we want to move into (2, 6) or (4, 6).\n\n**Option B: Move RIGHT to (4, 5)**\n*   *If Snake 1 goes RIGHT to (2, 5):* Score 4-3 for them. We are at (4, 5). We are now positioned to attack (5, 4) in 1 move (DOWN) or contest the right side.\n*   *Pros:* Maximizes lateral movement, gives us great control over the center-right.\n*   *Cons:* We give up the left side apples (2, 6) and (2, 5) entirely and allow Snake 1 to gain control of that crucial space.\n\n**Option C: Move LEFT to (2, 5)**\n*   *Risk:* HIGH RISK of collision/draw. If Snake 1 also goes RIGHT, we both die.\n*   *If Snake 1 doesn't move RIGHT:* We score and take the lead 4-3!\n\n### The Killer Instinct: The Apple at (2, 6) is the Key\n\nThe apple at (2, 6) is now an *unguarded* second-level objective, provided Snake 1 goes for the (2, 5) collision.\n\nIf we move UP to (3, 6), we immediately line up to take (2, 6) next turn, securing the tie one turn later, and putting us back in a strong, central position. This is the **safest and most strategically sound counter-move.**\n\nWe are banking on Snake 1 prioritizing the immediate apple at (2, 5) and risking the collision, which would leave the (2, 6) apple untouched for us to grab next turn. Since both snakes avoided the collision at (2, 6) last turn, it suggests Snake 1 is also risk-averse, but the (2, 5) move is *extremely* tempting for a competitor.\n\n*Let's assume Snake 1 goes for the obvious target (2, 5).*\n\n1.  **Us:** Move UP to (3, 6). *Positioning for (2, 6).*\n2.  **Snake 1:** Move RIGHT to (2, 5). *Scores 4-3.*\n3.  **Next Turn (T8):** We move LEFT to (2, 6). *Scores 4-4.* We are back in the game and Snake 1 is now congested on the left edge.\n\nWhat if Snake 1 also moves UP to (1, 6)?\n1.  **Us:** Move UP to (3, 6).\n2.  **Snake 1:** Move UP to (1, 6).\n3.  **Next Turn (T8):** The apple (2, 5) and (2, 6) are still available! We are still ahead of them for (2, 6). We can move LEFT to (2, 6). Snake 1 must move RIGHT or we cut them off.\n\n### Plan Conclusion: Set up the un-contested score.\n\nThe move UP to (3, 6) guarantees our survival and sets up the highest probability of securing an apple uncontested on the very next turn, whether Snake 1 goes for (2, 5) or moves UP. This is pure strategic positioning, CHAT! We outplayed their risk aversion!\n\n**Long-Term Strategy Note:** Use the corner space we just dominated (2, 5) and (2, 6) to increase length, then pivot RIGHT to start pressing them on the (5, 4) and (7, 4) apples. We need to maintain length parity and then extend to block!\n\nUP",

Let\u2019s cook this move.\n\nCurrent heads:\n- **Us**: (1,5) with body (1,6),(0,6),(0,7)\n- **Them**: (3,5) with body (3,6),(4,6),(4,7)\n\nNearby apples: **(2,5)** and **(2,6)** right between us, plus the whole mid cluster.\n\n---\n\n## 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Check all four moves from (1,5)\n\n### \ud83d\udd3c UP \u2192 (1,6)\n- That\u2019s our own neck segment.\n- Moving backwards into your own body = instant death \u2620\ufe0f  \n\ud83d\udc49 **ILLEGAL**\n\n---\n\n### \u25b6\ufe0f RIGHT \u2192 (2,5) \ud83c\udf4e (contested apple!)\n- On board, tasty apple.\n- But enemy from (3,5) can go:\n  - LEFT \u2192 (2,5) \ud83c\udf4e\n  - RIGHT \u2192 (4,5)\n  - DOWN \u2192 (3,4)\n  - UP is illegal (into their own neck at (3,6)).\n\nIf **we go RIGHT** and **they go LEFT**, both heads land on (2,5):\n- Double-head collision \u2192 **we BOTH die** \ud83d\udca5\n- Both get +1 apple \u2192 4\u20134, then game ends \u2192 **DRAW**.\n\nWe\u2019ve *already* passed up the 2,6 contest last turn for this exact reason. Same story here:\n- Best case: we live and go 4\u20133.\n- Worst (very realistic) case: immediate **draw**, zero win equity.\n\nWe\u2019re not here to coin-flip a draw on stream, chat.  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Too risky / avoid head-on contest**\n\n---\n\n### \u25c0\ufe0f LEFT \u2192 (0,5)\n- Safe this turn (empty square, no possible head-on from them).\n- New body after move:\n  - Head: (0,5)\n  - Body: (1,5), (1,6), (0,6)\n\nNext turn from (0,5):\n- UP \u2192 (0,6) = our body \u274c\n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,5) = our body \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 off the board \u274c\n- DOWN \u2192 (0,4) \u2705\n\nSo we\u2019d have **only ONE legal move** next turn (DOWN along the wall). That\u2019s how *we* get boxed in instead of them.  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Safe now, but HORRIBLE flexibility. Pass.**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd3d DOWN \u2192 (1,4)\n- Square is empty.\n- Enemy can\u2019t reach (1,4) from (3,5) in one step \u2192 no head-on possible.\n- Their new body from any of their moves doesn\u2019t touch (1,4) \u2192 no body collision.\n\nAfter moving DOWN:\n- New snake:\n  - Head: (1,4)\n  - Body: (1,5), (1,6), (0,6)\n\nNext turn from (1,4):\n- UP \u2192 (1,5) = our body \u274c\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,4) \u2705\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,4) \u2705\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,3) \u2705\n\nSo we keep **3 legal lanes** open. Beautiful.\n\nStrategically:\n- We stay **central**, not glued to a wall.\n- We sit **under** the opponent, perfect to grow a vertical wall that pushes them upward/right later.\n- We still have good paths toward:\n  - (2,5)/(2,6) area from the side,\n  - bottom apples (2,0),(5,0),(6,2) if the mid gets too hot.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Safe AND flexible.**\n\n---\n\n## 2\ufe0f\u20e3 DOWN vs RIGHT \u2013 final call\n\n- **RIGHT to (2,5)**:\n  - Gains an apple if they dodge.\n  - But any time they choose LEFT, game hard-ends in a **draw**.\n  - It\u2019s the exact kind of symmetrical coinflip we rejected on (2,6) last turn.\n\n- **DOWN to (1,4)**:\n  - 100% safe vs all their replies.\n  - Preserves **three** future exits.\n  - Keeps us central and underneath them for future boxing.\n\nWe\u2019re playing to **win**, not to flip for a tie. So we stay disciplined and slide **DOWN** again.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd2e Short plan for Future Me\n\n1. **Hold the mid-left column (x=1\u20132)**: From (1,4), aim to keep 2\u20133 exits each turn, drifting under and slightly left of enemy.\n2. **Let them commit to the hot center apples**: We\u2019ll rotate around and hunt apples that don\u2019t force double-heads, especially lower ones if mid is too contested.\n3. **Grow a vertical \u201cwall\u201d under them**: Use our body to limit their downward options, gradually herding them toward the right side and, eventually, the right wall.\n4. **No symmetric YOLOs**: Avoid any apple where both heads can clearly arrive from mirror positions. We only take contested apples when we have a positional edge or they can\u2019t mirror.\n\nWe keep space, we keep options, and we set up the long squeeze later. \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\udc0d  \n\nDOWN",
