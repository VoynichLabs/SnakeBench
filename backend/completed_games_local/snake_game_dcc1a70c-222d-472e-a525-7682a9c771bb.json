(1,5) at 3 steps.\n2. (0,1) and (6,3) at 4 steps each.\n\n**Path to (1,5):**\n- From (2,3) to (1,5): one possible path is LEFT to (1,3), then UP twice to (1,5).\n- This is a 3-step path: LEFT, UP, UP.\n\n**Path to (0,1):**\n- From (2,3) to (0,1): LEFT twice to (0,3), then DOWN twice to (0,1).\n- This is a 4-step path: LEFT, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN.\n\n**Path to (6,3):**\n- From (2,3) to (6,3): RIGHT four times to (6,3).\n- This is a 4-step path: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy Snake's Potential Moves:**\n- If enemy moves RIGHT to (1,9), it heads towards the top-left quadrant.\n- If enemy moves DOWN to (0,8), it heads down the left edge.\n- Neither of these moves immediately threatens your path to (1,5) or (0,1).\n\n**Potential Head-on Collisions:**\n- Your possible moves: LEFT to (1,3), RIGHT to (3,3), DOWN to (2,2), UP to (2,4).\n- Enemy's possible moves: RIGHT to (1,9), DOWN to (0,8).\n- No overlap in head positions, so no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Moving towards (1,5) is the fastest path to an apple.\n- Moving LEFT towards (1,3) is the first step towards (1,5).\n- Moving RIGHT towards (6,3) is also a viable option but takes more steps.\n- Moving DOWN or UP does not directly advance towards the closest apples.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Safety:** All four directions are safe from immediate death.\n2. **Efficiency:** Moving LEFT starts the path to the closest apple (1,5).\n3. **Future Options:** Moving LEFT keeps multiple paths open for subsequent moves.\n4. **Enemy Position:** Enemy is far away and not blocking your path to (1,5).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The optimal move is LEFT to (1,3).\n- This move begins the path to the closest apple (1,5).\n- It maintains safety and keeps future options open.\n- It does not risk collision with the enemy.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n- Move LEFT to (1,3).\n- Next turn, if still safe, move UP to (1,4).\n- Then move UP to (1,5) to collect the apple.\n- After that, assess the board for the next closest apple.\n\nLEFT",

RIGHT and UP are both safe. RIGHT moves me into position to target the cluster of apples at (6,3) and (8,3) - this provides multiple targets and keeps my options open. UP moves toward the center of the board and positions me for future moves toward (1,6) or other apples.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (6,4). This positions me to target the cluster of apples at (6,3) and (8,3). After collecting these apples, I should aim to reach 50 apples before the enemy. I should maintain awareness of the enemy's position at (6,7) with body at (6,8) and avoid creating situations where they can force me into a corner or trap.

This brings me closer to the apple at (3, 6) directly above me. From (3, 4), I can move up to reach (3, 6), then work toward other apples. This also keeps me at a safe distance from enemy snake #0 which is at (4, 8) directly above me.\n\n- **RIGHT to (5, 4)**: Moves me toward the right side of the board. This positions me for the apples at (7, 4) and (8, 5). Moving right keeps me away from enemy snake #0 which is at (4, 8) directly above me. From (5, 4), I can move up and right to collect the apple at (7, 4), then continue toward (8, 5).\n\n- **UP to (4, 5)**: Moves me upward but keeps me on the middle of the board. This brings me closer to enemy snake #0 which is at (4, 8) directly above me. From (4, 5), I can continue moving up to reach the apple at (4, 8), then work toward (6, 9) and other right-side apples. This is a direct path to an apple but brings me closer to enemy territory.\n\n**Enemy consideration:**\nEnemy snake #0 is at (4, 8) with body extending down and left. My current position (4, 4) is directly below enemy #0. Moving UP brings me closer to enemy #0's vertical position, which could lead to a head-on collision. Moving LEFT or RIGHT takes me horizontally away from enemy #0's direct path. Enemy #0 is likely to move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT this turn, so I need to consider their potential moves.\n\n**Strategy analysis:**\n- LEFT to (3, 4) provides good positioning for the apple at (3, 6) while maintaining distance from enemy snake #0. This moves me away from the direct vertical path of enemy #0.\n- RIGHT to (5, 4) provides good positioning for future apple collection on the right side while maintaining distance from enemy snake #0. This allows me to work toward the apples at (7, 4) and (8, 5).\n- UP to (4, 5) brings me closer to the apple at (4, 8) directly above me. This is a direct path to an apple but brings me closer to enemy #0's territory and increases the risk of a head-on collision.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (5, 4) to maintain distance from enemy snake #0 while positioning for the right-side apples at (7, 4) and (8, 5). From (5, 4), I can move up and right to collect the apple at (7, 4), then continue toward (8, 5). This keeps me away from enemy #0's direct path while maintaining multiple escape routes and apple collection opportunities. Avoid moving directly up to (4, 5) to minimize the risk of a head-on collision with enemy #0.\nRIGHT",

This is the most direct path toward the apple cluster on the left side of the board. From (7, 6), I can continue moving left toward the apples at (1, 6), (3, 6), and (1, 0). This also keeps me away from enemy snake #0's territory.\n\n- **RIGHT to (9, 6)**: Safe but moves me to the right edge of the board. This puts me directly against the right wall, limiting my future movement options to only LEFT, UP, and DOWN. This could potentially trap me.\n\n- **UP to (8, 7)**: Safe but moves me in the direction of enemy snake #0. Enemy snake #0 is at (7, 7), so moving UP to (8, 7) would put me adjacent to them. This is risky because enemy snake #0 could move RIGHT to (8, 7) next turn, potentially forcing a head-on collision or limiting my movement options.\n\n**Enemy consideration:**\nEnemy snake #0 is at (7, 7) directly to my left. They have several move options this turn. Moving LEFT to (7, 6) moves me away from enemy snake #0's position and maintains distance. Moving UP to (8, 7) would put me adjacent to enemy snake #0, which is risky.\n\n**Strategy analysis:**\nLEFT to (7, 6) is the most attractive move because:\n1. It moves me toward the apple at (2, 5) while maintaining a safe distance from enemy snake #0\n2. It keeps multiple escape routes available\n3. It positions me well for future moves toward the apple cluster at (1, 6), (3, 6), and (1, 0) on the left side of the board\n4. Moving RIGHT to (9, 6) would put me against the right wall, limiting my future movement options and potentially trapping me\n5. Moving UP to (8, 7) would put me adjacent to enemy snake #0, which is risky\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove LEFT to (7, 6), then continue moving left toward the apple at (2, 5) and the cluster of apples at (1, 6), (3, 6), and (1, 0) on the left side of the board. This path keeps me away from enemy snake #0's territory while maximizing apple collection opportunities.\nLEFT",
