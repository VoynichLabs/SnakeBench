Safe.\n- DOWN to (5, 3): Open, moves toward apple at (3, 3) and (9, 3). Safe.\n- LEFT to (4, 4): Open. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (6, 4): Open. Safe.\n\nI need to choose a move that positions me well. Enemy snake #1 is at (1, 4). It has apples at (1, 5) (directly above it) and (1, 7) (two up). It might move UP.\n\nIf I move UP to (5, 5), I get closer to (5, 7). If I move DOWN to (5, 3), I get closer to (3, 3) and (9, 3).\n\nLet's evaluate the immediate safety and future potential.\n- UP: Target (5, 7). Distance 2.\n- DOWN: Target (3, 3). Distance 2 (diagonal effectively). Target (9, 3) is further.\n\nLet's consider the enemy. Enemy is at (1, 4). If I move UP to (5, 5), I am away from the enemy. If I move DOWN to (5, 3), I am closer to the enemy's potential path if it moves East, but currently the enemy is at x=1.\n\nActually, the apple at (1, 5) is directly above the enemy. The enemy will almost certainly move UP to (1, 5) to eat that apple immediately. This grows the enemy. I should avoid the enemy's head location for the next turn. The enemy will be at (1, 5).\n\nMy options:\n- UP: (5, 5). Open. Safe from enemy.\n- DOWN: (5, 3). Open. Safe from enemy.\n- LEFT: (4, 4). Open. Safe.\n- RIGHT: (6, 4). Open. Safe.\n\nI need to eat apples to win. The apple at (5, 7) is on my vertical line. The apple at (3, 3) is slightly left and down. The apple at (9, 3) is far right and down.\n\nIf I go UP now, I head towards (5, 7). If I go DOWN, I head towards (3, 3) and (9, 3).\n\nLet's look at the board map:\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n7 . A . . . A . . . .\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n5 . A . . . . . . . .\n4 . 1 . . . 0 . . . .\n3 . . . A . . . . . A\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n1 . . . . . . . . . .\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nApple at (5, 7) is straight up. Apple at (3, 3) is down-left.\nApple at (1, 5) is occupied by enemy next turn (likely).\nApple at (1, 7) is up-left.\nApple at (9, 3) is far.\n\nMoving UP (to 5, 5) keeps me on the X=5 column, putting me right below the apple at (5, 7). This seems efficient.\nMoving DOWN (to 5, 3) puts me closer to (3, 3) and (9, 3), but I have to choose a direction.\nMoving LEFT (to 4, 4) or RIGHT (to 6, 4) are neutral.\n\nGiven the apple at (5, 7) is very close (2 moves away) and on my current path, I should prioritize it.\nSo, UP is the best immediate move.\nEND RATIONALE\nUP",

Illegal.\n    *   **LEFT (0, 7)**: Available.\n    *   **RIGHT (2, 7)**: Available.\n    *   The apple at (1, 7) was eaten last turn (Snake #1 grew from 1 to 2 apples, and moved from (1,6) to (1,7)).\n    *   The closest apple to Enemy #1 is at (3, 3). To get there, they likely need to go DOWN. However, from (1, 7), they cannot go DOWN to (1, 6) because that is their own body.\n    *   This leaves UP, LEFT, or RIGHT as likely moves for Enemy #1. Note that LEFT (0, 7) is the edge of the board, which is a dead end for them.\n\n*   **My Moves from (5, 7)**:\n    *   **UP (5, 8)**:\n        *   **Static Check**: Empty.\n        *   **Simultaneous Check**: Enemy #1 cannot reach (5, 8) or (5, 7) (my neck) in one turn. Max range is 1. Distance is 4. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN (5, 6)**:\n        *   **Static Check**: My own body is at (5, 6). Moving here is suicide.\n        *   **Result**: **DEAD**.\n    *   **LEFT (4, 7)**:\n        *   **Static Check**: Empty.\n        *   **Simultaneous Check**: Enemy #1 cannot reach (4, 7) or (5, 7). Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT (6, 7)**:\n        *   **Static Check**: Empty.\n        *   **Simultaneous Check**: Enemy #1 cannot reach (6, 7) or (5, 7). Safe.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- **Eliminate DOWN**: Hitting my own body (5, 6) is a death sentence.\n- **Evaluate Targets**: The nearest apples are (7, 1) and (8, 7). I am at (5, 7).\n    - To reach (7, 1), I generally want to move RIGHT and DOWN. Moving **RIGHT** takes me towards the x-coordinate of the apple (x=7). It also keeps me centered in the board (x=6).\n    - To reach (8, 7), I want to move **RIGHT**. This is the direct path. (8, 7) is only 2 squares away (6->7->8).\n    - Moving **LEFT** takes me toward the left edge (x=0) and away from the right-side apples. The right side has a cluster: (8, 7), (9, 9), (9, 3). The left side has (3, 3).\n    - Moving **UP** takes me closer to the top edge and (9, 9), but away from (7, 1) and (8, 7).\n\n- **Decision**: **RIGHT** is the optimal move. It moves towards the cluster of 3 apples on the right side (8,7; 9,9; 9,3) and maintains distance from the enemy on the far left (x=1). It avoids the top wall (y=9) early, keeping escape options open.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nNavigate towards the right side cluster. The immediate goal is (8, 7) or (9, 9). Keep track of Enemy #1; if they head towards the left wall (0,7), they trap themselves. If they go UP or RIGHT, they might compete for the right-side apples, but I am currently closer.\nEND RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Safety Analysis:**\n- **Current Position:** `(9, 7)`.\n- **Board Boundaries:** X ranges 0-9. My head is at X=9 (Right Edge).\n- **Available Moves:**\n    - **UP (9, 8):** Y increases to 8. The board shows `(9, 8)` as empty (currently no snake or apple there). Safe.\n    - **DOWN (9, 6):** Y decreases to 6. The board shows `(9, 6)` as empty. Safe.\n    - **RIGHT (10, 7):** X=10 is outside the board (max 9). This move would kill me. **Unsafe.**\n    - **LEFT (8, 7):** This cell is currently occupied by my own body (specifically, the segment that was right behind my head last turn). Moving back into your own body immediately behind you counts as suicide. **Unsafe.**\n\n**2. Strategic Analysis:**\n- **Enemy #1:** Located at `(4, 8)`. Distance is significant (> 5 moves). No immediate threat of collision this turn.\n- **Apples:**\n    - `(9, 9)`: 2 moves away (Right -> Up, or Up -> Right).\n    - `(9, 3)`: 4 moves away (Down).\n    - `(7, 1)`: 4 moves away (Left, Left, Down, Down).\n- **Decision:**\n    - **UP (9, 8)** is the best move. It moves towards the cluster of apples at the top right `(9, 9)` and `(9, 3)`. It also keeps me on the right edge, which is generally safer as I only have to worry about threats from 3 directions instead of 4.\n    - **DOWN (9, 6)** is a valid safe move but moves me away from the nearby apple at `(9, 9)` and towards the center, potentially exposing me to the enemy.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to `(9, 8)`. Next turn, move UP to `(9, 9)` to eat the apple. After growing, I can decide whether to drop down to `(9, 8)` again to target `(9, 3)` or exit the edge towards `(8, 9)` if the enemy approaches. Monitor enemy movement, but currently, I am safe to pursue the top-right apples.\n\nUP",

Strategic Decision:**\nI have two safe moves: **UP** and **LEFT**.\n*   **UP to `(9, 9)`:** This square contains an apple. Eating the apple gives me a point, and the snake grows. If I eat, my tail does not move this turn (standard rules: growth delays tail movement). Even if the tail doesn't move, the body is currently at `(9, 7)`. The snake will occupy `(9, 9)`, `(9, 8)`, and `(9, 7)`. This is a safe formation.\n*   **LEFT to `(8, 8)`:** This moves towards the center but misses the guaranteed apple at `(9, 9)`.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving **UP** to `(9, 9)` is the optimal move. It secures a point and keeps me safe in the corner. If I don't die (and looking at the board, I won't), this move allows me to continue towards `(9, 3)` or move out later.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nMove UP to `(9, 9)` to eat the apple. Assuming survival, next turn I will likely move DOWN to `(9, 8)` to target the apple at `(9, 3)`. Monitor Snake #1.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nUP\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

However, moving RIGHT limits my ability to retreat if something blocks the path ahead (though the path is currently clear). Moving DOWN keeps options open (I could go Left or Right next turn) and continues the descent. Given the apple is at `(9, 3)`, I need to descend. Both DOWN and RIGHT move me closer to the apple. RIGHT moves me closer horizontally, DOWN moves me closer vertically. Since I am at `y=5` and the apple is at `y=3`, I need to go down. I am at `x=8`, the apple is at `x=9`. I can get there by going RIGHT then DOWN twice, or DOWN twice then RIGHT. The current path DOWN is safe and direct.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving DOWN continues the safest path toward the apple at `(9, 3)`.

The Apple at `(0, 8)` is gone (likely eaten by Snake #1 in a previous turn or moved). The Apple at `(0, 9)` is gone. I need to ensure my next move is safe from these new threats.\n\n**Current State:**\n- My Head: `(8, 4)`\n- My Body: `[(8, 5), (8, 6), (8, 7)]` (Length 4)\n- Target: Apple at `(9, 3)`\n\n**Safety Check (Moves from `(8, 4)`):**\n1.  **UP:** Target `(8, 5)`.

From here, I can move RIGHT to `(9, 3)` to eat the apple.\n- **RIGHT** moves me to `(9, 4)`. This is adjacent to the apple. I could move DOWN to `(9, 3)` next.\n- **LEFT** moves me away from the target.\n\nBoth DOWN and RIGHT bring me closer to the apple. DOWN is the best move because it aligns me vertically with the apple. If I move DOWN to `(8, 3)`, the only safe direction next turn is likely RIGHT to `(9, 3)` (eating the apple). If I move RIGHT to `(9, 4)`, DOWN is the only safe direction. Both paths are viable. Moving DOWN keeps me one step away from the wall, maintaining slightly more flexibility if anything unexpected happens, though with a snake length of 4, my tail will vacate `(8, 7)` this turn, opening space.\n\nLet's stick to the plan: Move DOWN to `(8, 3)`, then RIGHT to eat the apple at `(9, 3)`.\n\nDOWN",

Apples: 3.\n- **Enemy Snake (1):** Head at `(1, 2)`, Body at `[(2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)]`. Apples: 5.\n- **Apples:** `(9, 3)`, `(7, 1)`, `(0, 8)`, `(0, 9)`, `(9, 9)`.\n\n**Immediate Threat Assessment:**\n1.  **My Tail:** At the start of Turn 16 (current state), my tail is at `(8, 6)`. After I move, it will move to `(8, 5)`. This vacates `(8, 6)` but leaves `(8, 5)` occupied.\n2.  **Enemy Snake (1) Move Prediction:** The enemy head is at `(1, 2)`. They can move UP to `(1, 3)` or LEFT to `(0, 2)`. Neither of these paths leads to a collision with my head or immediate body.\n3.  **Apple Safety:** The apple at `(9, 3)` is adjacent to my head. I must move to it to eat it. However, I must check for head-on collisions. The enemy cannot reach `(9, 3)` in one move from `(1, 2)`. Therefore, `(9, 3)` is safe for me to move into.\n\n**Option Evaluation:**\n- **UP:** Target `(8, 4)`. This is currently occupied by my own body (specifically, the segment connected to my head). **DEADLY.**\n- **LEFT:** Target `(7, 3)`. Safe, but moves away from the apple at `(9, 3)`.\n- **DOWN:** Target `(8, 2)`. Safe, but moves away from the apple at `(9, 3)`.\n- **RIGHT:** Target `(9, 3)`. This cell contains an apple. It is not occupied by my body (my body is at `x=8`) or the enemy body. It is safe. Moving here allows me to eat an apple, extending my length and gaining a point.\n\n**Strategy:**\nEat the apple at `(9, 3)` to grow and gain points. This is the safest and most advantageous move.\n\n**Immediate Plan for Next Turn (to be recorded):**\nAfter moving RIGHT to `(9, 3)` and eating the apple, my head will be at `(9, 3)`, and my body will extend to `[(8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6)]`. My options will be LEFT (to `(8, 3)`, now my body), UP (to `(9, 4)`), or DOWN (to `(9, 2)`). Based on the board, `(9, 4)` is empty and likely the best path toward the apple at `(9, 9)`.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

Body: `[(8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)]`. (Tail is at `(8, 5)`).\n*   **Enemy Snake (1):** Head at `(0, 2)`. Body: `[(1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)]`. (Tail at `(3, 4)`).\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1.  **UP (Target: `(9, 4)`):**\n    *   **Board Check:** According to the current board state, `(9, 4)` contains my own tail `T`. However, in standard Snake mechanics, the tail moves away at the start of the turn. Assuming my body length hasn't changed (I didn't eat this turn), the tail will move from `(8, 5)` to `(8, 4)`.\n    *   **Result:** `(9, 4)` is empty. It is a valid move.\n    *   **Safety:** `(9, 4)` is safe.\n\n2.  **DOWN (Target: `(9, 2)`):**\n    *   **Board Check:** The board shows `(9, 2)` is empty (`. `).\n    *   **Result:** Valid move.

Moving off the board (x=10) is lethal. **INVALID.**\n\n**Decision:**\nI have two safe options: `UP` and `DOWN`.\n*   **UP** moves me towards the cluster of apples at `(9, 9)`, `(0, 9)`, and `(0, 8)`.\n*   **DOWN** moves me towards apples at `(9, 1)` (not currently visible but in that direction) and `(7, 1)`.\n\nThe board shows a significant cluster of apples in the top-left quadrant (row 8 and 9). Moving `UP` aligns me with the row containing `(9, 9)`. The column to my left (x=8, x=7) is mostly blocked by my own body and the wall, so moving `UP` keeps future options open to traverse the top edge. Moving `DOWN` would force me to navigate around my own body or the wall to get back up to the high-value targets.\n\nTherefore, moving `UP` is the optimal strategic choice to pursue the remaining apples.\n\nUP",

The board state seems to be a 'best-of' or a simulation, but treating it as live, I must avoid the obstacle at (9, 4) if it remains. I will check if (9, 4) is clear or if I must turn.\n\nCurrent State Analysis:\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at `(9, 4)`. Body: `[(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)]`.\n*   **Enemy Snake (1):** Head at `(0, 3)`. Body: `[(0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3)]`.\n*   **Apples:** `(7, 1), (0, 8), (0, 9), (9, 9), (3, 8)`.\n\nMove Evaluation:\n1.  **UP (Target: `(9, 5)`):**\n    *   Based on the \"last move info\", I was at `(9, 3)` and moved UP to `(9, 4)`. The \"START LAST MOVE PICK\" indicates the intended move was UP.\n    *   I assume the snake is now at `(9, 4)` with body `[(9, 3), ...]`.\n    *   The current board state is ambiguous (showing `0` at `(9, 4)` and `T` at `(9, 5)`). However, in a live turn, the tail moves forward. If I am at `(9, 4)`, my tail (currently at `(8, 5)` based on the turn info) will move to `(8, 4)`.\n    *   The board shows `(9, 5)` is `T`. If this `T` is *my* body, I cannot move there. However, if it is a remnant of the previous state (where I was at `(9, 3)`), the cell `(9, 4)` would have been empty. If the `T` at `(9, 5)` is my *old* body part that hasn't shifted in the displayed state, then moving to `(9, 5)` is likely safe *if* the tail moves.\n    *   Let's look at the `T` on the board. Row 5: `T` at `(9, 5)`. Row 4: `0` at `(9, 4)`. Row 3: `T` at `(9, 3)`.\n    *   This looks like a visual artifact. If I am at `(9, 4)`, the cell `(9, 5)` is likely the next segment of my body. **Wait**, if I just moved from `(9, 3)` to `(9, 4)`, then `(9, 4)` is my head, `(9, 3)` is my neck. The rest of the body is `[(8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)]`. The cell `(9, 5)` is *not* currently occupied by my body in the logical state described in the \"Last Rationale\".\n    *   However, the board is the ground truth. If `(9, 5)` is a `T` and it belongs to me, I cannot go there.\n    *   Let's re-read the board. `Row 5` has `T` at `(9, 5)`. `Row 4` has `0` at `(9, 4)`. `Row 3` has `T` at `(9, 3)`.\n    *   This implies my body is `(9, 3), (9, 4), (9, 5)`? No, the \"Last Rationale\" gave `Body: [(8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)]`.\n    *   The board is likely showing the state *before* my move. The `0` at `(9, 4)` might be me. The `T` at `(9, 5)` might be the result of the tail growing or moving there if I ate?\n    *   Let's assume the standard logic: I am at `(9, 4)`. If `(9, 5)` is `T` (my body), I cannot go UP.\n    *   Let's check the \"Last Rationale\" again. It says \"I moved RIGHT from (8, 3) to (9, 3)\". Wait, that was turn 17.\n    *   Turn 17: Head `(9, 3)`.\n    *   Turn 18 (Current): I moved UP (from the prompt's last move info). So I am at `(9, 4)`.\n    *   My body: `[(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)]`.\n    *   Target `(9, 5)`: Is this in my body? No. `(9, 5)` is not in `[(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)]`.\n    *   Is `(9, 5)` off board? No.\n    *   Is `(9, 5)` enemy? No.\n    *   **Wait**, the board shows `(9, 5)` is `T`. The board is 10x10. `Row 5` index 9 is `T`.\n    *   There is a conflict between the \"Last Rationale\" description of the body and the visual board.\n    *   Usually, I must trust the board state.\n    *   If `(9, 5)` is `T`, it might be a tail that is about to move. If it is *my* tail, and it moves to `(9, 4)` (my head), I die. No, heads move first.\n    *   If `(9, 5)` is a `T` that is a part of my body that I didn't know about? Or maybe the board is showing the result of my move?\n    *   Let's look at the \"last move info\". It says \"The current board state shows my snake at (9, 3)\". Then it discusses the move.\n    *   The prompt says \"Turn: 18\". The \"Last Move\" block explains Turn 17.\n    *   So at Turn 18, I am at `(9, 4)` (since I moved UP).\n    *   The board provided *with* Turn 18 has `0` at `(9, 4)`. This confirms my position.\n    *   The board has `T` at `(9, 5)`. This is *directly above me*.\n    *   Is `(9, 5)` part of my body?\n    *   My body is `[(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)]`.\n    *   `(9, 5)` is not in that list.\n    *   However, if the board shows `T` there, it is likely a bug or a \"ghost\" of the previous turn's tail.\n    *   BUT, if I move UP to `(9, 5)` and it is physically occupied by a `T` (tail) that hasn't vanished yet, I die.\n    *   Let's look at the Tail. My tail is `(8, 5)`. It moves to `(8, 4)`.\n    *   Is it possible `(9, 5)` is the *new* tail? No.\n    *   Let's assume the board is correct. If `(9, 5)` is `T`, and it's my body, I cannot go UP.\n    *   Where did the `T` come from? The previous head was `(9, 3)`. Body `[(8, 3), ...]`.\n    *   Maybe the board state is \"simulated\" or \"locked\".\n    *   Let's look at the `T`s carefully.\n    *   `(9, 5)` is `T`.\n    *   `(9, 3)` is `T`.\n    *   `(9, 4)` is `0`.\n    *   This looks like I am `(9, 4)`, with a body segment at `(9, 3)` and another at `(9, 5)`. This implies a gap or a loop? No, that's impossible.\n    *   Maybe the `T` at `(9, 5)` is just a display bug from the previous turn where I ate and grew?\n    *   Let's look at `RIGHT`.\n    *   `(10, 4)` is off board. NO.\n    *   `LEFT`.\n    *   `(8, 4)`. Board shows `.`.\n    *   My body: `[(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)]`.\n    *   If I move LEFT, I go to `(8, 4)`.\n    *   Is `(8, 4)` in my body? Yes.\n    *   Wait. The body list `[(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)]` means `(8, 4)` is the 3rd segment (index 3).\n    *   So `LEFT` is blocked by my own body. NO.\n    *   `DOWN`.\n    *   `(9, 3)`. Board shows `T`. My body includes `(9, 3)`. NO.\n    *   `UP`.\n    *   `(9, 5)`. Board shows `T`.\n    *   Is `(9, 5)` in `[(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)]`? No.\n    *   Is it possible that the board `T` at `(9, 5)` is a \"dud\"?\n    *   Let's look at the previous turn's tail. `(8, 6)` was mentioned in \"Last Rationale\" as the old tail, moving to `(8, 5)`.\n    *   If `(9, 5)` is `T`, it must be from a previous state where I was at `(9, 4)` and had a body there.\n    *   Let's check if I can move into a tail. Yes, usually you can, because it moves away.\n    *   However, the rule says \"If your head moves into any snake's body... you die\".\n    *   Is a tail \"body\"? Yes.\n    *   Does the tail move *before* or *simultaneously*?\n    *   \"All snakes move simultaneously\". \"If your head moves into any snake's body... you die\".\n    *   This usually implies that if the cell is occupied at the start of the turn (except the tail of the moving snake), you die.\n    *   However, usually, you *can* move into where the tail *was*.\n    *   But if `(9, 5)` is `T`, and it's a tail, and it moves to `(9, 4)` (my current head), then `(9, 5)` becomes empty.\n    *   BUT, I am at `(9, 4)`. If I move UP to `(9, 5)`, and the tail at `(9, 5)` moves to `(9, 4)`, we swap.\n    *   The rule is: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n    *   If I move UP to `(9, 5)` and the tail at `(9, 5)` moves to `(9, 4)`, is that a collision?\n    *   Yes, because the head and tail swap, effectively putting my head into the tail's spot and the tail into my head's spot. Usually, swapping with the tail is allowed *if* the tail moves away.\n    *   BUT, the board shows `T` at `(9, 5)`.\n    *   Let's consider `DOWN`. `(9, 3)`. Board `T`.\n    *   My body `[(9, 3), ...]`. So `(9, 3)` is my body.\n    *   `LEFT`. `(8, 4)`. Board `.`.\n    *   My body `[(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)]`. So `(8, 4)` is my body.\n    *   `RIGHT`. Off board.\n    *   `UP`. `(9, 5)`. Board `T`.\n    *   Is `(9, 5)` my body?\n    *   Let's look at the board again.\n    *   Row 9: `A . . . . . . . . . A`\n    *   Row 8: `A . . A . . . . . .`\n    *   Row 5: `. . . . . . . . . T` (at x=9)\n    *   Row 4: `. . . . . . . . . 0` (at x=9)\n    *   Row 3: `1 . . . . . . . . T` (at x=9)\n    *   This `T` pattern suggests my body is vertical at x=9.\n    *   If I am `0` at `(9, 4)`, and `T` at `(9, 3)` and `(9, 5)`.\n    *   This is a \"ghost\" or a \"bug\" in the prompt's board generation.\n    *   However, I must play the board.\n    *   If `(9, 5)` is `T`, it is likely the segment that was at `(9, 4)` before I moved there (if the board represents the state *after* my move but *before* tail update? No, standard state is usually before move).\n    *   Let's assume standard snake logic. The tail moves forward.\n    *   My tail is `(8, 5)`. It moves to `(8, 4)`.\n    *   My head is `(9, 4)`.\n    *   The board shows `T` at `(9, 5)`.\n    *   If `(9, 5)` is `T`, it must be a body part.\n    *   If it is a body part, I cannot go there.\n    *   So I must go somewhere else.\n    *   But I have no other moves?\n    *   `LEFT`: `(8, 4)`. Board `.`. My body: `[(8, 4), ...]`. So `LEFT` is body. NO.\n    *   `DOWN`: `(9, 3)`. Board `T`. My body: `[(9, 3), ...]`. So `DOWN` is body. NO.\n    *   `RIGHT`: Off board. NO.\n    *   `UP`: `(9, 5)`. Board `T`. If `T` is my body, I die.\n    *   If I am trapped, I die.\n    *   However, usually, the `T` at `(9, 5)` might be the tail.\n    *   My tail is `(8, 5)`.\n    *   Is it possible the board is showing the state *before* the move *and* I am not actually at `(9, 4)`?\n    *   \"My last move information\" says I moved UP.\n    *   \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (9, 4)\". (Top of prompt).\n    *   So I am definitely at `(9, 4)`.\n    *   The board is definitely showing `T` at `(9, 5)`.\n    *   If `T` is my tail, and it is at `(9, 5)`, then my body is `(9, 5) -> (9, 4) -> (9, 3) -> ...`\n    *   Wait. If my body is `(9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), ...`\n    *   Then moving UP to `(9, 6)` is the only way?\n    *   No, the `T` at `(9, 5)` is just a graphical representation of the previous state.\n    *   Let's look at the `T` at `(9, 5)` again. It is in Row 5.\n    *   My tail is at `(8, 5)`.\n    *   If the board is the \"Current State\" at Turn 18, and I am at `(9, 4)`.\n    *   The `T` at `(9, 5)` is likely a \"stale\" `T` from the previous turn where I was at `(9, 3)` and the segment `(9, 4)` existed.\n    *   However, if I trust the board blindly, I cannot move UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n    *   This implies I must move RIGHT, which is impossible.\n    *   There must be a safe move.\n    *   Let's re-examine `LEFT` to `(8, 4)`.\n    *   Board: `(8, 4)` is `.`.\n    *   My body: `[(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)]`.\n    *   Wait. The head is `(9, 4)`.\n    *   The body is `[(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)]`.\n    *   This means the segment at `(8, 4)` is the 3rd segment.\n    *   If I move LEFT, I go to `(8, 4)`.\n    *   Is the tail moving? Yes, `(8, 5)` moves to `(8, 4)`? No, `(8, 5)` moves to `(8, 4)`.\n    *   If `(8, 5)` moves to `(8, 4)`, then `(8, 4)` becomes occupied by the tail *after* I move?\n    *   No, if I move LEFT to `(8, 4)`, and the tail moves from `(8, 5)` to `(8, 4)`, we collide.\n    *   Wait. The tail is `(8, 5)`. It moves to `(8, 4)`.\n    *   So if I go LEFT to `(8, 4)`, I die.\n    *   So `LEFT` is invalid.\n    *   `DOWN` to `(9, 3)`. Head moves there. The segment at `(9, 3)` (which is the neck) moves to `(9, 4)`.\n    *   So `(9, 3)` becomes empty?\n    *   Wait. If I go DOWN, I go to `(9, 3)`. The segment at `(9, 3)` moves to `(9, 4)`.\n    *   So `(9, 3)` becomes my new head. The old head `(9, 4)` becomes the neck.\n    *   Is `(9, 3)` occupied?\n    *   The board shows `T` at `(9, 3)`.\n    *   But in the \"Last Rationale\", `(9, 3)` was the head at Turn 17.\n    *   At Turn 18 (Current), `(9, 3)` is the *neck*.\n    *   So `(9, 3)` is occupied by my body.\n    *   So `DOWN` is invalid.\n    *   `UP` to `(9, 5)`.\n    *   Board shows `T` at `(9, 5)`.\n    *   Is `(9, 5)` part of my body?\n    *   My body: `[(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)]`.\n    *   No.\n    *   If `T` is there, maybe it's a remnant.\n    *   Let's check the enemy.\n    *   Snake #1 is at `(0, 3)`.\n    *   It is far away.\n    *   Is there any other snake? No.\n    *   So the `T` at `(9, 5)` is likely my tail?\n    *   My tail is `(8, 5)`.\n    *   Why is there a `T` at `(9, 5)`?\n    *   Maybe I am longer than I think?\n    *   Or maybe the board is just showing `T` for \"trail\" and it's not strictly accurate for the head position?\n    *   Let's assume the \"safe\" move is `UP`.\n    *   Why? Because `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` are definitely blocked.\n    *   `RIGHT` is wall.\n    *   `LEFT` and `DOWN` are body (based on the logic that the body follows the head).\n    *   So `UP` is the *only* direction that *might* be clear.\n    *   Even if the board shows `T`, if that `T` is the tail, it will move away.\n    *   However, the tail is at `(8, 5)`.\n    *   Let's assume the `T` at `(9, 5)` is just a graphical error or a ghost of the previous segment.\n    *   Or, if I look at the \"Last Rationale\" again:\n    *   \"The current board state shows my snake at (9, 3)\".\n    *   \"Since I moved RIGHT from (8, 3) to (9, 3), the tail has advanced from (8, 6) to (8, 5)\".\n    *   This logic is for Turn 17.\n    *   Now Turn 18. I moved UP to (9, 4).\n    *   My body is `(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)`.\n    *   If I move UP to `(9, 5)`:\n        *   My head goes to `(9, 5)`.\n        *   The segment `(9, 3)` moves to `(9, 4)`.\n        *   `(8, 3)` moves to `(9, 3)`.\n        *   `(8, 4)` moves to `(8, 3)`.\n        *   `(8, 5)` (tail) moves to `(8, 4)`.\n        *   New body: `(9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4)`.\n    *   This path is valid *if* `(9, 5)` is empty.\n    *   The board shows `(9, 5)` is `T`.\n    *   If that `T` is a \"ghost\" of the previous state (Turn 17: Head at `(9, 3)`), then the `T` at `(9, 5)` might be a leftover that shouldn't be there.\n    *   OR, if I ate an apple at `(9, 3)` on Turn 17, I grew.

If I ate on Turn 17, my tail didn't move on Turn 17.\n    *   So at the start of Turn 18, my tail is *still* at `(8, 6)`.\n    *   Let's re-read carefully: \"The current board state shows my snake at (9, 3), having just moved there to eat an apple.\"\n    *   This is the state at the *start* of Turn 18?\n    *   No, usually the \"Turn X\" description is the state *before* making the move for Turn X.\n    *   Wait. Turn 18. I am at `(9, 4)` (from the prompt \"Head: (9, 4)\").\n    *   So I *already* moved UP to `(9, 4)`.\n    *   Okay, I am at `(9, 4)`.\n    *   I ate on Turn 17. So I grew on Turn 17.\n    *   At the start of Turn 18, my tail is at `(8, 6)`? No.\n    *   If I ate on Turn 17 (moved to `(9, 3)`), I didn't shrink.\n    *   So my body is `(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6)`.\n    *   Wait, the \"Last Rationale\" says \"tail has advanced from (8, 6) to (8, 5)\".

Or it assumes the move happened?\n    *   \"Since I moved RIGHT from (8, 3) to (9, 3), the tail has advanced from (8, 6) to (8, 5).\"\n    *   This implies I *didn't* eat. But the text says \"having just moved there to eat an apple\".\n    *   There is a contradiction in the \"Last Rationale\".\n    *   If I ate, tail stays at `(8, 6)`.\n    *   If I didn't eat, tail moves to `(8, 5)`.\n    *   The \"Last Rationale\" explicitly says \"I must account for the movement from the previous turn. Since I moved RIGHT... the tail has advanced\".\n    *   So the \"Last Rationale\" assumes I did *not* eat.\n    *   BUT the text says \"having just moved there to eat an apple\".\n    *   Let's look at the board. Row 1 has `A` at `(7, 1)`.\n    *   Row 3 has `1` at `(0, 3)`.\n    *   I am at `(9, 4)`.\n    *   Where is the apple I ate?\n    *   The \"Last Rationale\" mentions an apple at `(9, 3)` (implied by \"eat an apple\").\n    *   Is there an apple at `(9, 3)` in the board? No.\n    *   The apples are at `(7, 1), (0, 8), (0, 9), (9, 9), (3, 8)`.\n    *   So I didn't eat an apple at `(9, 3)`.\n    *   Wait, maybe I ate an apple *before* Turn 17?\n    *   \"Your snake (ID 0) apples: 4\".\n    *   If I ate on Turn 17, I would have 5 apples.\n    *   The score is 4.\n    *   So I did *not* eat on Turn 17.\n    *   Therefore, the \"Last Rationale\" is correct: I moved RIGHT to `(9, 3)`.

No.\n        So UP.\n\n        One edge case: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body\".\n        If I am at `(9, 4)`, and my body is behind me at `(9, 3)`.\n        If I go DOWN, I hit `(9, 3)`. That is backwards. I die.\n        So `DOWN` is definitely backwards into body.\n        `LEFT` is `(8, 4)`. My body is `(8, 4)`. Is that \"directly backwards\"?\n        My head is at `(9, 4)`. The neck is at `(9, 3)`.\n        `(8, 4)` is to the left.\n        The body continues from `(9, 3)` to `(8, 3)`.\n        `(8, 4)` is adjacent to `(9, 4)` but not \"behind\" the head (which is defined as the previous position).\n        However, if `(8, 4)` is occupied by my body, I die regardless.\n        So `LEFT` is death.\n        `DOWN` is death.\n        `RIGHT` is death.\n        `UP` is the only move.\n\n        Final check. Is it possible `(9, 5)` is an apple?\n        Apples: `(7, 1), (0, 8), (0, 9), (9, 9), (3, 8)`.\n        No.\n        So it's just an empty (or ghost `T`) square.\n\n        UP.\n\n        I will write a short plan.\n        \"Plan: Move UP to avoid collision with my own body at (9, 3) and (8, 4). I am blocked on the right by the wall. I will navigate towards the apple at (9, 9).\"\n\n        Wait, the prompt says \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n        So I need to output:\n        [Plan]\n        UP\n\n        The prompt says: \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\n        So the plan should be a block of text, then the word.\n\n        Plan:\n        Move UP to avoid my body at (9, 3) and (8, 4). The board shows a T at (9, 5), but it is not in my body list, so it is likely a graphical artifact. This moves me towards the apple at (9, 9).\n\n        UP\n\n        (Wait, is it possible the `T` at `(9, 5)` is the tail of Snake #1?)\n        No, Snake #1 is at `(0, 3)`.\n\n        So UP.\n\n        The prompt asks me to \"Think out loud\".\n        I will output the thought process, then the plan, then the move.\n\n        Thought process:\n        I am at (9, 4).\n        Moves:\n        RIGHT: Wall.\n        LEFT: (8, 4) is Body.\n        DOWN: (9, 3) is Body.\n        UP: (9, 5).\n        Board says (9, 5) is T.\n        My body list: [(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)].\n        (9, 5) is not in the list.\n        So T is a ghost.\n        Therefore UP is safe.\n\n        Plan:\n        Move UP to navigate towards (9, 9) apple. Avoid self-collision.\n\n        UP\n\n        (Self-check: Did I miss any apples?)\n        Apples at: (7, 1), (0, 8), (0, 9), (9, 9), (3, 8).\n        I am at (9, 4).\n        (9, 9) is the closest.\n        Yes.\n\n        (Self-check: Is there any danger from Snake #1?)\n        Snake #1 is at (0, 3). It moves randomly or towards apples.\n        It is far.\n        No danger.\n\n        (Self-check: Is there any danger from myself?)\n        Yes, I am boxed in.\n        UP is the only escape.\n\n        (Self-check: Is the board state \"Turn: 18\" correct?)\n        Yes.\n        Head: (9, 4).\n        Body: [(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)].\n        This is a \"C\" shape or a \"U\" shape open to the right?\n        No, open to the top?\n        (9, 4) is head.\n        (9, 3) is neck.\n        (8, 3) is body.\n        (8, 4) is body.\n        (8, 5) is tail.\n        This is a spiral or a corner.\n        (9, 4) -> (9, 3) -> (8, 3) -> (8, 4) -> (8, 5).\n        Visual:\n        (8,5) T\n        (8,4) T\n        (8,3) T\n        (9,3) T\n        (9,4) 0\n        I am at (9, 4). My tail is (8, 5).\n        If I move UP to (9, 5).\n        (9, 5) is empty?\n        The board shows T.\n        If the board is showing the \"history\" of the snake, (9, 5) might be where I was 2 turns ago?\n        No, I was at (8, 3) then (9, 3).\n        I have never been at (9, 5).\n        So the T at (9, 5) is a bug.\n        I will move UP.\n\n        Final check on the \"Last Move Info\".\n        It says I moved UP to (9, 3)? No, it says I moved RIGHT to (9, 3) on Turn 17.\n        Then I moved UP to (9, 4) on Turn 18 (implied by current state).\n        Wait, the prompt says \"Your last move information: UP\".\n        So on Turn 17 (the previous turn), I moved UP.\n        This means I was at (9, 3) on Turn 17? No, (8, 3).\n        Wait.\n        \"Last Move Info\" says:\n        \"The current board state shows my snake at (9, 3), having just moved there to eat an apple.\"\n        \"Since I moved RIGHT from (8, 3) to (9, 3)...\"\n        This is a contradiction in the \"Last Move Info\".\n        \"Last Move Info\" says I moved UP.\n        \"Last Move Info\" says I moved RIGHT.\n        \"Last Move Info\" says \"START LAST MOVE PICK: UP\".\n        So the *intent* was UP.\n        The *explanation* says RIGHT.\n        The *result* is (9, 4).\n        So I effectively moved UP?\n        Or I moved RIGHT?\n        If I moved RIGHT, I would be at (9, 3).\n        If I moved UP, I would be at (8, 3)? No, (8, 3) is my body.\n        If I was at (8, 3) and moved UP, I go to (8, 4).\n        But the current state is (9, 4).\n        So the \"Last Move Info\" is very confusing.\n        However, the *Current State* provided at the top of the prompt is the ground truth.\n        \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (9, 4)\".\n        \"Body: [(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 4), (8, 5)]\".\n        I must trust this.\n        So I am at (9, 4).\n        The board is consistent with this (0 at 9,4, T at 9,3).\n        So I must move from (9, 4).\n        Logic stands: UP is the only option.\n\n        UP\n\n        (One last check on the board `T` at `(9, 5)`).\n        If the board is showing the state *after* my move?\n        No, it says \"Board state: ... Turn: 18\".\n        Usually means state at start of turn.\n        If the `T` at `(9, 5)` is part of my body *now*, then I have a body segment there.\n        If I have a body segment there, the \"Body:\" list is wrong.\n        If the \"Body:\" list is wrong, I am in trouble.\n        But I must assume the \"Body:\" list is correct because it is explicitly given in the prompt structure.\n        So I proceed with UP.\n\n        Plan:\n        I am currently at (9, 4) with my body creating a barrier below and to the left. The only open direction is UP towards (9, 5). The board shows a \"T\" at (9, 5), but this does not match my body list, so I will treat it as a graphical artifact and move UP to pursue the apple at (9, 9).\n\n        UPI am currently at (9, 4). My body surrounds me to the left and below: (9, 3) is directly below, and (8, 4) is to the left. Moving LEFT to (8, 4) or DOWN to (9, 3) would result in immediate collision with my own body. Moving RIGHT is impossible as it is off the board. Therefore, the only viable direction to avoid suicide is UP towards (9, 5). Although the board displays a \"T\" at (9, 5), this coordinate is not present in my current body list. I will assume this is a graphical artifact or a stale \"ghost\" of a previous tail position that has moved, allowing me to pass safely.\n\nPlan: Move UP to open space towards the apple at (9, 9). Avoid getting trapped by my own body or the right wall.\n\nUP",

It is safe.\n\n3.  **Safety of Future Positions:**\n    *   If I move **LEFT** to (7, 9), my tail will move from (9, 5) to (9, 6).\n    *   My body will be: (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6).\n    *   Next turn, I can likely move LEFT again to (6, 9) or DOWN to (7, 8) (if empty).\n    *   I am moving towards apples at (8, 7) and (5, 7).\n    \n    *   If I had moved **DOWN**, I would have died on the wall (8, 8).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe only safe and legal move is **LEFT**. Moving DOWN hits a wall. Moving RIGHT hits my body. Moving UP is off board.\n\n**Strategy:**\nSurvive and navigate the top row to get closer to the central apples at (8, 7) and (5, 7). Watch out for the enemy snake at (0, 9).\n\n**Decision:**\nMove LEFT.\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

This cell is `.` (empty) on the board. **Safe**.\n4.  **RIGHT**: Target cell `(8, 7)`. This cell contains an apple `A`. **Safe**.\n\nMy last move was **DOWN**. I am currently at `(7, 7)`.\nWait, looking at the \"Your last move information\" section, it says I moved **DOWN**.\nIf my head was at `(7, 8)` (implied by the body list starting at `(7, 8)` in the prompt structure, though the text says head is `(7, 7)`), moving down would land me at `(7, 7)`.\nThe prompt is contradictory about the head position.\n- Text: \"Head: (7, 7)\"\n- Body: \"Body: [(7, 8), ...]\"\n- Board: \"7 T . . A . A . 0 A .\"\n\nIf I trust the board and the body list, the head is likely `(7, 7)` (on the board) and the body is `[(7, 8), (7, 9), ...]`. The prompt's text \"Head: (7, 7)\" matches the board.\nSo, currently at `(7, 7)`.\n\nRe-evaluating moves from `(7, 7)`:\n- **UP to (7, 8)**: Occupied by my body. **KILLS ME**.\n- **DOWN to (7, 6)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT to (6, 7)**: Empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to (8, 7)**: Apple. Safe.\n\nI must avoid UP.\n\nStrategy:\nThere are two apples near me: one at `(7, 1)` (bottom) and one at `(8, 7)` (right).\nThere is also an apple at `(5, 7)` to the left.\nI have 150 turns total and I am on turn 27. I have plenty of time.\nI need to avoid getting trapped.\nIf I go LEFT to `(6, 7)`, I am moving towards `(5, 7)`.\nIf I go RIGHT to `(8, 7)`, I eat an apple immediately. This adds length. My tail won't move.\nIf I go DOWN to `(7, 6)`, I am moving towards the bottom apple `(7, 1)`.\n\nThe board has \"T\" (walls) on the edges.\nRow 7 looks like: `T . . A . A . 0 A .`\nThe safe space is in the middle.\nGoing RIGHT to `(8, 7)` eats an apple. This is good. It also puts me at `(8, 7)`.\nFrom `(8, 7)`, I can move to `(9, 7)` (which is `.`), or `(8, 6)` (which is `.`), or `(8, 8)` (which is `T`), or back `(7, 7)` (which will be occupied by my body).\nSo `(8, 7)` seems safe for one turn.\n\nHowever, the apple at `(8, 7)` is right next to a wall at `(9, 7)` and `(9, 8)`. If I go to `(8, 7)`, I might get stuck against the right wall if I keep going right. But I can go down or up (if clear).\n\nLet's look at the apple at `(5, 7)`. If I go LEFT to `(6, 7)`, I am getting closer to `(5, 7)`.\nLeft is generally safer than right on this board because the right side is a wall.\nIf I go LEFT, I can then go LEFT to `(5, 7)` (Apple).\nFrom `(5, 7)`, I can go DOWN towards `(5, 1)` or `(5, 0)`.\nThe center of the board is mostly empty.\n\nWait, let's check the enemy snake.\nSnake #1 is on the left wall.\nHead: `(3, 9)`. Body: `[(2, 9), ...]`.\nThis snake is moving away from me (towards the top left corner).\n\nLet's look at my tail. My tail is at `(9, 8)`.\nIf I move, my tail will eventually move. I need to ensure I don't cut off my own escape.\n\nLet's re-read the \"My last move\" info.\nIt says: \"My head is at `(7, 8)` (as shown on the board...\". This is a contradiction in the AI's own previous thought process. The board shows `0` at `(7, 7)`.\nThe prompt text \"Head: (7, 7)\" is likely correct.\nThe \"Last Rationale\" provided by the user is hallucinating a position that doesn't match the board or the text, or the text in the user prompt is wrong.\nUser prompt: \"Head: (7, 7)\"\nUser prompt: \"Body: [(7, 8), ...]\"\nBoard: \"7 ... ... ... ... ... ... 0 ...\"\nBoard Row 7: `T . . A . A . 0 A .`\nSo the `0` is at column 7, row 7.\nTherefore the head is `(7, 7)`.\nThe body starts at `(7, 8)`.\nThis is a valid snake shape.\n`(7, 7)` -> `(7, 8)` -> `(7, 9)` ...\n\nOkay, valid.\nMoves from `(7, 7)`:\n- UP: `(7, 8)` -> Collision.\n- DOWN: `(7, 6)` -> Safe.\n- LEFT: `(6, 7)` -> Safe.\n- RIGHT: `(8, 7)` -> Safe (Apple).\n\nI must not go UP.\n\nBetween LEFT, DOWN, and RIGHT:\n- RIGHT gets me an apple immediately.\n- LEFT moves me towards an apple.\n- DOWN moves me towards an apple.\n\nSince RIGHT is safe and gets an apple, I should probably take it.\nLet's verify if `RIGHT` is safe to move into.\nTarget `(8, 7)` is marked `A`. There is an apple there. It is not a wall or snake body.\nSo it is safe.\nIf I eat the apple, I grow. My tail `(9, 8)` stays. The snake becomes `[(8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8)]`.\nThis keeps me along the top wall and center.\nI will have to move next turn. From `(8, 7)`, I cannot go UP (to `(8, 8)` is `T`).\nI cannot go RIGHT (to `(9, 7)` is `.`) -> Safe.\nI cannot go LEFT (to `(7, 7)` is body).\nI can go DOWN (to `(8, 6)` is `.`) -> Safe.\nSo from `(8, 7)` I have 2 safe moves.\n\nWhat if I go LEFT to `(6, 7)`?\nFrom `(6, 7)`, I can go to `(5, 7)` (Apple).\nI can go to `(6, 6)` (Empty).\nI can go to `(6, 8)` (Empty).\nI can go to `(7, 7)` (Body).\nSo 3 safe moves.\nLeft is slightly more flexible but doesn't get an apple immediately.\n\nGiven the choice between immediate gain (RIGHT) and flexibility (LEFT), I should consider the immediate gain because the board is open.\nHowever, there is a snake on the left side (Enemy #1) which might eventually come down. I am on the right side.\nIf I move RIGHT to `(8, 7)`, I am moving towards the corner `(9,9)`.\nIf I move LEFT, I am moving towards the center.\nThe board is 10x10.\nThere is an apple at `(5, 7)` to the left.\nThere is an apple at `(7, 1)` down.\nThere is an apple at `(3, 7)` and `(3, 8)` left.\n\nI am at `(7, 7)`.\nIf I go LEFT, I am at `(6, 7)`. Next I can go to `(5, 7)` (Apple).\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at `(8, 7)` (Apple).\n\nLet's look at the Enemy Snake #1 at `(3, 9)`.\nIt is near the top left.\nIt has a body stretching down the left wall.\nIt is not a threat to me right now.\nI should focus on getting apples.\n\nThe \"Last Rationale\" provided by the user suggested moving DOWN. But that rationale was based on the head being at `(7, 8)`.\nSince my head is actually at `(7, 7)`, DOWN is a safe move to `(7, 6)`.\nHowever, RIGHT gets an apple.\nLEFT gets me closer to an apple.\n\nLet's look at the specific board layout again.\nRow 7: `T . . A . A . 0 A .`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nApple at 8. Apple at 3. Apple at 5.\nI am at 7.\nI can move to 8 (Apple) or 6 (Empty) or 1 (Empty? No, x=1 is row 9? No, x is column).\nColumn 6 is empty.\nColumn 8 is apple.\n\nIs there any reason NOT to take the apple at `(8, 7)`?\nIf I take it, I grow. My tail (currently at `(9, 8)`) stays.\nNext turn I am at `(8, 7)`.\nFrom `(8, 7)`, I can go DOWN to `(8, 6)` (Empty) or RIGHT to `(9, 7)` (Empty).\nI cannot go UP (Wall) or LEFT (Body).\nThis leaves me with an open path down or right.\nMoving down `(8, 6)` leads to `(8, 5)` etc. These are empty.\nMoving right `(9, 7)` leads to `(9, 6)` etc.\n\nThis seems perfectly fine. I gain a point.\n\nWhat if I go LEFT to `(6, 7)`?\nI don't gain a point immediately. I reach `(6, 7)`.\nFrom `(6, 7)`, I can go to `(5, 7)` (Apple).\nThis path is also fine.\n\nThe decision comes down to: Do I want to go towards the apple at `(8, 7)` or the apple at `(5, 7)`?\nThere is also an apple at `(7, 1)` way down.\nAnd `(3, 8)` and `(3, 7)`.\n\nThe board is open.\nThe most important rule is \"Don't die\".\nThe second rule is \"Get apples\".\nGoing RIGHT gets an apple immediately.\nGoing LEFT delays getting an apple by 1 turn.\nGoing DOWN delays getting an apple significantly (to get to `(7, 1)`).\nSo DOWN is the worst of the three safe options.\nBetween LEFT and RIGHT, RIGHT gives an immediate reward.\n\nIs there a trap at `(8, 7)`?\n`(9, 7)` is empty. `(8, 6)` is empty. `(8, 8)` is wall. `(7, 7)` will be body.\nIt's a safe spot.\n\nWait, if I move RIGHT, I eat the apple. My body extends.\nCurrent body: `(7, 7)`, `(7, 8)`, `(7, 9)`, `(8, 9)`, `(9, 9)`, `(9, 8)`.\nNew Head: `(8, 7)`.\nNew Body: `(8, 7)`, `(7, 7)`, `(7, 8)`, `(7, 9)`, `(8, 9)`, `(9, 9)`, `(9, 8)`.\nTail stays at `(9, 8)`.\nMy body now blocks `(7, 7)` and `(7, 8)`.\nI am at `(8, 7)`.\nNext turn, I cannot go LEFT. I cannot go UP.\nI can go DOWN or RIGHT.\nThis is fine.\n\nIf I move LEFT to `(6, 7)`.\nI don't eat an apple.\nNext turn I can go to `(5, 7)` (Apple).\nFrom `(5, 7)`, I can go to `(4, 7)` (Empty), `(5, 6)` (Empty), `(5, 8)` (Empty), `(6, 7)` (Body).\nThis is also fine.\n\nThe apple at `(5, 7)` is closer to the enemy's potential path (left side) than the apple at `(8, 7)`.\nThe apple at `(8, 7)` is on the right side, safer.\nI should secure the apple at `(8, 7)`.\n\nHowever, let's consider the \"Last Move\" info again. It says \"DOWN\".\nIf the previous move was DOWN, and I am now at `(7, 7)`, that implies I was at `(7, 8)`.\nIf I am at `(7, 7)`, I should not go BACK UP (to `(7, 8)`). That is suicide.\nSo UP is out.\nI should not go BACKWARDS into my own body.\nMy body is behind me at `(7, 8)`.\nSo UP is backwards.\nI should move FORWARD (Left, Right, or Down relative to the direction of movement).\n\nWait, does \"backwards\" mean relative to the snake's orientation?\n\"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nThe cell behind my head is `(7, 8)`.\nSo UP leads to `(7, 8)`, which is backwards. DEATH.\n\nSo UP is definitely out.\nLEFT, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\nRIGHT gets an apple.\nLEFT gets me closer to a cluster of apples ((5,7), (3,7), (3,8)).\nDOWN gets me to (7,6), closer to (7,1).\n\nIf I go LEFT, I am moving towards the enemy snake on the left (Snake #1). Snake #1 is at `(3,9)`.\nSnake #1 is moving. It might move down the left side.\nIf I go LEFT, I might get into a conflict with Snake #1 later.\nIf I go RIGHT, I move away from Snake #1.\nSo RIGHT is safer in terms of enemy interaction.\n\nAlso, if I go RIGHT and eat the apple, my body grows. This might block Snake #1 if it ever comes over (unlikely, it's on the far left).\nSo RIGHT seems good.\n\nLet's double check the coordinates.\nHead: `(7, 7)`.\nApple at `(8, 7)` (Right).\nApple at `(5, 7)` (Left).\nApple at `(7, 1)` (Down).\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I am at `(8, 7)`.\nFrom `(8, 7)`, I can go DOWN to `(8, 6)`. This leads to the bottom. There are no apples listed down there except `(7, 1)`. `(8, 1)` is empty. I can sweep the bottom.\nIf I go LEFT, I am at `(6, 7)`.\nFrom `(6, 7)`, I can go to `(5, 7)` (Apple). Then `(4, 7)`. Then `(3, 7)` (Apple).\nThis path takes me left.\nGoing left puts me in a potential squeeze if Snake #1 comes down.\nSnake #1 is at `(3, 9)`. If it moves DOWN, it goes to `(3, 8)`. There is an apple at `(3, 8)`. Snake #1 might go for it.\nIf I am moving left to get to `(3, 7)`, I might collide with Snake #1 going to `(3, 8)` or `(3, 7)`.\nSo the left side is contested.\nThe right side is empty.\nI should take the safe apple on the right.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Your last move ... DOWN\".\nIf I move RIGHT, I am turning right relative to my previous move (DOWN).\nThat is allowed.\n\nPlan:\n1. Move RIGHT to `(8, 7)` to eat the apple.\n2. Grow.\n3. Next turn, probably move DOWN to `(8, 6)` to head towards the bottom of the board, sweeping for apples.\n4. Avoid the left side where the enemy is.\n\nOne detail: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point (1 apple).\"\nI will be at 6 apples.\n\nIs there any danger at `(8, 7)`?\nNo.\n\nIs there any reason to go DOWN instead?\n`(7, 6)` is empty.\n`(7, 1)` is an apple.\nIf I go DOWN, I don't get an apple immediately.\nIf I go RIGHT, I do.\nThe prompt asks me to \"prefer moves that both increase your chance of safely eating apples\".\nRIGHT does that immediately.\n\nIs there any danger in moving RIGHT?\nThe enemy snake is far away.\nMy own body is behind me.\nThe board edge is at 9. I am at 7. I can go to 8.\n\nOne check: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body\".\nIf I am at `(7, 7)` and my body is `(7, 8)`, then UP is backwards. Correct.\nIf I move RIGHT, I go to `(8, 7)`.\nIs `(8, 7)` part of my body? No.\nIs `(8, 7)` part of enemy body? No.\nIs `(8, 7)` out of bounds? No.\n\nOkay.\n\nWait, looking at the board again:\nRow 7: `T . . A . A . 0 A .`\nIndices 0-9.\n0: T\n1: .\n2: .\n3: A\n4: .\n5: A\n6: .\n7: 0\n8: A\n9: .\n\nWait, the string is `T . . A . A . 0 A .`\n`T` (0), `.` (1), `.` (2), `A` (3), `.` (4), `A` (5), `.` (6), `0` (7), `A` (8), `.` (9).\nWait, `.` (9) is `.`.\nSo `(9, 7)` is `.`. Empty.\n`(8, 7)` is `A`. Apple.\nSo moving RIGHT lands on an apple.\nMoving RIGHT again lands on `(9, 7)`, which is empty.\nSo I have space.\n\nWhat if I go LEFT?\n`(6, 7)` is `.`. Empty.\n`(5, 7)` is `A`. Apple.\nSo LEFT gets an apple on the second move.\nRIGHT gets an apple on the first move.\nRIGHT is faster.\n\nI will choose RIGHT.\n\nWait, let me check if `RIGHT` is \"UP\" or \"RIGHT\" in the context of the board.\nThe prompt says: \"decreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\"\nMy head is `(7, 7)`. x=7.\nApple is at `(8, 7)`. x=8.\nSo increasing x = RIGHT.\nCorrect.\n\nFinal check on the \"Last Rationale\" vs Reality.\nRationale says: \"My head is at (7, 8)\".\nPrompt says: \"Head: (7, 7)\".\nBoard says: `(7, 7)`.\nIf the Rationale is wrong, I must trust the Prompt and Board.\nIf the Prompt is wrong, I must trust the Board.\nThe Board is the source of truth for the state.\nThe Prompt text \"Head: (7, 7)\" matches the Board.\nTherefore I am at `(7, 7)`.\nThe Rationale's plan (move DOWN) was based on a wrong premise.\nSo I am free to choose the best move from `(7, 7)`.\n\nMy move is RIGHT.\n\nOne last check: Could the enemy snake #1 (at `(3, 9)`) reach me in 1 turn? No.\nCould it reach me in 2 turns? Maybe, but it's on the left side.\n\nWhat about my own tail?\nIf I move RIGHT to `(8, 7)`, my tail stays at `(9, 8)`.\nMy body will be `(8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8)`.\nThis creates a shape.\nThe path `RIGHT` -> `DOWN` -> `DOWN`... seems valid.\n\nWhat if I go LEFT?\nMy body becomes `(6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8)`.\nPath: `LEFT` -> `LEFT` -> `LEFT`... goes into the center.\n\nThe center has apples at `(5,7), (3,7), (3,8)`.\nThe right side has apples at `(8,7), (7,1)`.\nThe right side seems less congested by the enemy.\nI will go RIGHT.\n\nReasoning:\n1.  Current head is `(7, 7)`.\n2.  Moves:\n    *   UP to `(7, 8)`: Occupied by my body. **DEADLY**.\n    *   DOWN to `(7, 6)`: Safe.\n    *   LEFT to `(6, 7)`: Safe.\n    *   RIGHT to `(8, 7)`: Safe (Apple).\n3.  Comparison:\n    *   RIGHT gives an immediate apple. It opens up the bottom-right corner.\n    *   LEFT moves towards the enemy and central apples.\n    *   DOWN moves towards the bottom apple.\n4.  Immediate apple is the priority among safe moves.\n\nDecision: RIGHT.\n\nWait, I need to make sure I don't write anything after the word. The prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\nI will write the reasoning first, then the word.\nThe prompt asks me to \"think out loud and explain your reasoning\".\nI must include the reasoning in the response.\nThe structure should be:\n- Reasoning\n- \"RIGHT\"\n\nI will format it clearly.\n\nDouble check the \"Last Move Information\" again. It says \"DOWN\".\nIf the previous move was DOWN, and I am at `(7, 7)`, I was at `(7, 8)`.\nThis implies I ate an apple at `(7, 7)`?\nIf I ate an apple at `(7, 7)` in the last move, my tail would stay at `(9, 9)` or something?\nLet's look at the body list in \"Your snake (ID: 0)\":\n\"Body: [(7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8)]\"\nThis implies the tail is `(9, 8)`.\nIf I am at `(7, 7)` (Head), and body is `(7, 8)`... `(9, 8)`.\nThis is 6 segments total.\nPrevious move was DOWN.\nIf I moved DOWN to `(7, 7)` from `(7, 8)`, I did not eat an apple.\nWait, if I moved DOWN to `(7, 7)` and there was an apple there, I would have eaten it.\nThe board shows `(7, 7)` is `0`.\nThe board shows `(7, 1)` is `A`.\nThe board shows `(7, 7)` is `0` (snake head).\nIs there an apple at `(7, 7)`?\nBoard Row 7: `T . . A . A . 0 A .`\nAt column 7, it is `0`. At column 8, it is `A`.\nSo `(7, 7)` is the snake. `(8, 7)` is an apple.\nSo if I moved DOWN to `(7, 7)`, I moved to a free spot.\nThat means `(7, 7)` did NOT have an apple in the previous turn (or I just ate it and the board updates after my move? No, board state is current).\nThe board state is \"Board state\". It shows `0` at `(7, 7)`.\nIf I moved DOWN to `(7, 7)`, I must have moved from `(7, 8)`.\nSo the previous head was `(7, 8)`.\nCurrent head is `(7, 7)`.\nThis confirms I did NOT eat an apple in the last move.\nSo I have 5 apples currently. I can get my 6th.\n\nOkay, logic holds up.\nI am at `(7, 7)`.\nMoves: UP (Death), DOWN (Safe), LEFT (Safe), RIGHT (Safe/Apple).\nI choose RIGHT.\n\nOne potential issue: \"Head-on collision\".\nIs it possible Snake #1 moves to `(8, 7)`? Snake #1 is at `(3, 9)`. Distance is huge. No.\nIs it possible I move into a spot Snake #1 is moving out of? No.\n\nOkay.\n\nOne edge case: The \"Rules\" say \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\".\nIf I move RIGHT to `(8, 7)`, I eat the apple.\nMy body length increases.\nMy tail `(9, 8)` will NOT move this turn.\nThis leaves a \"hole\" where `(9, 8)` was, but it's filled by the previous segment `(9, 9)` extending to `(9, 8)`? No.\nThe snake moves.\nHead moves to `(8, 7)`.\nBody segment 1 moves to where head was `(7, 7)`.\nBody segment 2 moves to where segment 1 was `(7, 8)`.\n...\nIf I ate an apple, the tail stays. So the snake gets longer.\nThis is fine.\n\nI will output \"RIGHT\".\n\nWait, I should be careful about the \"My last move information\" text. It contains a \"Rationale\" that was generated by the user/system.\nIt says: \"My head is at (7, 8) (as shown on the board and confirmed by the body list starting at (7, 9))\".\nThis is confusing.\nLet's re-read the board.\nRow 9: `T T T 1 . . . T T T`\nRow 8: `T . . A . . . T . T`\nRow 7: `T . . A . A . 0 A .`\n\nThe prompt \"Your snake (ID: 0)\" says:\nHead: (7, 7)\nBody: [(7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8)]\n\nIf the Head is (7, 7), and the body is [(7, 8)...], then the snake is:\n(7, 7) -> (7, 8) -> (7, 9) -> (8, 9) -> (9, 9) -> (9, 8).\n\nThis fits on the board.\nRow 7 has `0` at (7, 7).\nRow 8 has `.` at (7, 8).\nRow 9 has `.` at (7, 9).\nWait, Row 9 says: `T T T 1 . . . T T T`\nIndex 7 is `T`.\nSo `(7, 9)` is `T`? A wall?\nIf `(7, 9)` is a wall, and my body says `(7, 9)`, then I am inside a wall?\nLet's look at the board string provided:\n\"9 T T T 1 . . . T T T\"\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\nSo index 7 is `T`.\nYes, `(7, 9)` is `T` (Wall).\nBut my body list says `(7, 9)`.\nThis means the body list or the board is inconsistent, or I am dead?\nOr the board drawing is slightly off?\n\"9 T T T 1 . . . T T T\"\nLet's write it out:\nx=0: T\nx=1: T\nx=2: T\nx=3: 1 (Enemy snake head)\nx=4: .\nx=5: .\nx=6: .\nx=7: T\nx=8: T\nx=9: T\n\nSo indeed, x=7, y=9 is a wall.\nBut my body includes `(7, 9)`.\nThis is a contradiction.\nMaybe the board string is shifted?\n\"9 T T T 1 . . . T T T\" - length is 10.\nMaybe the \"T T T\" is the left edge?\n\"9 T T T 1 . . . T T T\"\nIf this is the top row (y=9), then x=0 is T, x=1 is T, x=2 is T.\nx=3 is '1'.\nx=4 is '.'\nx=5 is '.'\nx=6 is '.'\nx=7 is 'T'\nx=8 is 'T'\nx=9 is 'T'\n\nIf my body is at `(7, 9)`, it is a wall.\nIf my body is at `(8, 9)`, it is a wall.\nIf my body is at `(9, 9)`, it is a wall.\nThe \"Your snake\" section says Body: `[(7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8)]`.\nThis implies I am occupying walls.\nHowever, the board also shows `T` at `(9,8)`?\nRow 8: `T . . A . . . T . T`\nIndices: 0: T, 1: ., 2: ., 3: A, 4: ., 5: ., 6: ., 7: T, 8: ., 9: T.\nSo `(9, 8)` is `T`.\nMy body says `(9, 8)`.\nSo I am inside walls?\n\nThis is highly likely a typo in the prompt data provided to me, where `T` represents empty space or the snake itself, or the coordinates are shifted.\nBut I must play by the rules.\nI am at `(7, 7)` (Head).\nI need to move.\nIf I ignore the wall contradiction and assume the body list is correct about the *relative* positions (i.e. the snake follows that path), then I should just use the Head position `(7, 7)` and the fact that my body occupies the cells listed.\n\nAssumption: The board text has `T` where the snake body is, or the prompter made a mistake drawing the board, but the coordinates `(7, 8)` etc. are valid *empty* space in the game logic (or occupied by me).\nWait, if `(7, 8)` is occupied by me, I cannot go UP.\nIf `(7, 8)` is a `T` (Wall), I cannot go UP.\nBoth imply UP is blocked.\n\nIf `(6, 7)` is `.` (empty), I can go LEFT.\nIf `(8, 7)` is `A` (Apple), I can go RIGHT.\n\nIf the board is correct, `(7, 8)` is `.` (Row 8, col 7).\nRow 8: `T . . A . . . T . T`\nCol 7 is `T`.\nWait.\nRow 8: `T . . A . . . T . T`\nIndices: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nCol 7 is `T`.\nSo `(7, 8)` is `T`.\nMy body says `(7, 8)`.\nSo I am in a wall?\nOr the `T` in the board string represents my body?\nUsually `T` is Wall/Obstacle.\nIf I am in a wall, I am dead.\nBut I am playing.\nLet's assume the board string `T` is actually my body or just \"Terrain\" that I can be on.\nOr, more likely, the board string provided is slightly wrong or `T` means \"Occupied\" (by me or wall).\nBut `.` means empty.\nLet's look at the definition: \"9 T T T 1 . . . T T T\"\nUsually `.` is empty. `T` is wall.\nIf `(7, 8)` is `T`, and my body is there, then `T` is my body.\nIf `(7, 9)` is `T`, and my body is there...\nIf `(9, 8)` is `T`, and my body is there...\nThe \"Your snake\" section lists body parts.\nThe \"Board state\" uses `0` for my head. `1` for enemy head. `.` for empty. `A` for apple.\nWhat is `T`?\n\"9 T T T 1 . . . T T T\"\nIf `T` is a wall, and I am supposedly at `(7, 9)` (which is `T`), then I am inside a wall.\nThis is a contradiction.\nI have to assume the board is correct and the \"Your snake\" text has typos in the coordinates, OR the board is visual and the text is data.\nGiven I am asked to move, I am not dead.\nI am at `(7, 7)` (Text says, Board shows `0` at x=7, y=7).\nLet's look at `0` position in board:\nRow 7: `T . . A . A . 0 A .`\nSo `0` is at index 7.\nSo Head is `(7, 7)`.\nThis is consistent.\nWhere is my body?\nRow 7 has `T` at 0, `0` at 7. No `0` elsewhere.\nRow 8: `T . . A . . . T . T`\nRow 9: `T T T 1 . . . T T T`\nThe board does NOT show the rest of my body as `0`. It shows it as `T`?\nOr maybe the body is not drawn? Or the `T`s are my body?\nIf the `T`s at `(7, 8)`, `(7, 9)`, `(8, 9)`, `(9, 9)`, `(9, 8)` are my body, then the board is showing my body as `T`.\nAnd the `T`s at `(0, 9)`, `(1, 9)`, `(2, 9)` are Enemy body?\nEnemy body is `(2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9)`.\nRow 9: `T T T 1 ...`\nIndices: 0, 1, 2, 3.\nSo `(0, 9)` is `T`, `(1, 9)` is `T`, `(2, 9)` is `T`.\nThis matches the enemy body.\nSo `T` represents SNAKE BODY (yours or enemy) or WALL?\nThere are `T`s at the edges too.\nRow 9: `T T T ... T T T` at start and end.\nRow 8: `T` at start and `T` at end.\nRow 7: `T` at start.\n\nIf `T` is a snake body (any snake), then:\nMy body at `(7, 8)` should be `T`.\nIs there a `T` at `(7, 8)` in the board?\nRow 8: `T . . A . . . T . T`\n`(7, 8)` is index 7. That is `T`.\nSo yes, `(7, 8)` is `T`.\nMy body at `(7, 9)` should be `T`.\nRow 9: `(7, 9)` is index 7. That is `T`.\nMy body at `(8, 9)` should be `T`.\nRow 9: `(8, 9)` is index 8. That is `T`.\nMy body at `(9, 9)` should be `T`.\nRow 9: `(9, 9)` is index 9. That is `T`.\nMy body at `(9, 8)` should be `T`.\nRow 8: `(9, 8)` is index 9. That is `T`.\n\nSo the board uses `T` to represent ANY snake body part (my or enemy).\nAnd `0` and `1` represent heads.\nAnd `.` is empty.\nAnd `A` is apple.\n\nThis resolves the confusion. `T` is \"Snake Body (segment)\".\n\nSo, to re-evaluate safety from `(7, 7)`:\n- **UP to `(7, 8)`**: Board shows `T` at `(7, 8)`. So it is occupied. Unsafe.\n- **DOWN to `(7, 6)`**: Row 6: `T . . . . . . . . .`\n  Index 7 is `.`. So `(7, 6)` is empty. Safe.\n- **LEFT to `(6, 7)`**: Row 7: `T . . A . A . 0 A .`\n  Index 6 is `.`. So `(6, 7)` is empty. Safe.\n- **RIGHT to `(8, 7)`**: Row 7: Index 8 is `A`. Apple. Safe.\n\nSo my previous analysis holds even with the `T` logic.\nUP is blocked by my body (shown as `T`).\nDOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe/empty/apple.\n\nThe choice remains between DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.\nRIGHT gets an apple immediately.\nLEFT moves towards center apples.\nDOWN moves towards bottom apple.\n\nI will go RIGHT.\n\nOne check: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow\".\nIf I go RIGHT to `(8, 7)`, I eat the apple.\nMy body extends.\nNext turn, my head is at `(8, 7)`.\nMy body will include `(7, 7)`.\nThe `T` at `(7, 7)` (currently head) will become body.\nThe `T` at `(7, 8)` will shift...\nThe tail `(9, 8)` will stay (if I ate).\nWait, did I eat? Yes, `A` at `(8, 7)`.\nSo tail stays.\nThis makes my body:\nHead: `(8, 7)`\nBody: `(7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8)`.\nThis matches the board drawing.\n\nIf I go LEFT to `(6, 7)`:\nHead: `(6, 7)`\nBody: `(7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8)`.\nI don't eat an apple.\nNext turn, tail `(9, 8)` will move.\n\nIf I go DOWN to `(7, 6)`:\nHead: `(7, 6)`\nBody: `(7, 7), ...`\nTail moves.\n\nComparing the paths:\nRIGHT path: `(8, 7)` -> `(8, 6)` -> `(8, 5)` ... (Clear path to bottom)\nLEFT path: `(6, 7)` -> `(5, 7)` (Apple) -> `(4, 7)` -> `(3, 7)` (Apple) ... (Central path, potential enemy interaction).\nDOWN path: `(7, 6)` -> `(7, 5)` ... (Clear path to bottom).\n\nGiven I am on turn 27/150, I have time.\nThe apple at `(8, 7)` is \"free\".\nThe apples at `(5, 7)` and `(3, 7)` require moving left.\nThe enemy is on the far left.\nI don't want to race the enemy for the left-side apples if I can secure right-side apples safely.\nSo RIGHT is the best move.\n\nI will write the output.\nThe prompt asks for \"short long-term plan or strategy note\".\nI will write:\n\"Move RIGHT to eat the apple at (8, 7). From there, move DOWN to sweep the bottom of the board for the apple at (7, 1), avoiding the enemy on the left side.\"\nThen \"RIGHT\".\n\nWait, the prompt says: \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\nSo I must ensure the reasoning is NOT the final line.\nI will put the move on a new line after the reasoning.\n\nStructure:\n[Reasoning]\n[Plan]\nRIGHT\n\nLet's draft the reasoning.\n\"Current head is (7, 7). Up is blocked by my body. Down, Left, and Right are safe. Right allows me to immediately eat the apple at (8, 7). This is safer than moving Left towards the enemy snake on the left side. Moving Down is safe but delays eating an apple.\"\n\nPlan:\n\"Eat the apple at (8, 7). Then move DOWN to collect the apple at (7, 1) or sweep the bottom edge. Keep away from the left wall where Snake #1 is.\"\n\nFinal Move:\nRIGHT\n\nThis looks correct.\n\nOne final check: Are there any apples at `(9, 7)` or `(8, 6)`?\nBoard:\nRow 7: `(8, 7)` is `A`.\nRow 6: `(8, 6)` is `.`.\nRow 5: `(8, 5)` is `.`.\n...\nRow 1: `(8, 1)` is `.`.\nRow 0: `(8, 0)` is `.`.\n\nSo the right side is clear of apples except `(8, 7)` (and `(7, 1)` is at x=7).\nWait, `(7, 1)` is at x=7, y=1.\nIf I go to `(8, 7)` then `(8, 6)`..., I am at x=8.\nI can go to `(7, 1)` by moving LEFT at some point.\nThis is fine.\n\nWhat if I go LEFT?\nApples at `(5, 7)`, `(3, 7)`, `(3, 8)`.\nThese are on the left.\nIf I go LEFT, I can get them.\nIf I go RIGHT, I leave them for the enemy (potentially).\nBut the enemy is at `(3, 9)`.\nIf the enemy goes for `(3, 8)` or `(3, 7)`, it might trap itself or die.\nIf I go LEFT, I might bump into the enemy.\nIf I go RIGHT, I avoid conflict.\nAvoiding conflict is good.\n\nI am confident in RIGHT.\n\nOne tiny detail: The prompt says \"Apples at: (7, 1), (3, 8), (8, 7), (5, 7), (3, 7)\".\nI am targeting `(8, 7)`.\nThe board shows `(8, 7)` is `A`.\nThe text confirms it.\nSo it is there.\n\nFinal confirmation: Is `(8, 7)` a valid move?\n`(8, 7)` is on the board.\n`(8, 7)` is not a wall.\n`(8, 7)` is not a snake body (shown as `T` or `0` or `1`).\n`(8, 7)` is `A`.\nSo valid.\n\nFinal confirmation: Is `(6, 7)` valid?\n`(6, 7)` is `.`.\nValid.\nIs `(7, 6)` valid?\n`(7, 6)` is `.`.\nValid.\n\nAll three are safe.\nRIGHT is the most rewarding.\nI choose RIGHT.\n\nThe prompt requires the last line to be exactly the word.\nI will not add punctuation or explanation after the word.\n\nFinal check on the \"Snake #1\" position.\nHead: `(3, 9)`.\nBody: `[(2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5)]`.\nThis snake occupies the left column and top row near the left.\nDistance to me: `|3-7| + |9-7| = 4 + 2 = 6`.\nIt is far.\nIt cannot reach me in 1 turn.\nCollision is not a risk this turn.\n\nI am ready.\n\nOne thought: What if the enemy moves RIGHT?\nIf Snake #1 moves RIGHT from `(3, 9)` to `(4, 9)`.\nIs `(4, 9)` empty?\nRow 9: `T T T 1 . . . T T T`\nIndex 4 is `.`.\nSo `(4, 9)` is empty.\nIf it moves to `(4, 9)`, it is still far away.\nIt will likely stay near the top or move down the empty columns.\n\nI will stick with RIGHT.\n\nThe prompt mentions \"My last move ... DOWN\".\nIf I moved DOWN to get to `(7, 7)`, I was at `(7, 8)`.\nThe body list `(7, 8)`... implies `(7, 8)` was the first body part.\nIf I was at `(7, 8)` and moved DOWN to `(7, 7)`, then `(7, 8)` is now the second segment (neck).\nMy body list `[(7, 8), ...]` is ordered head-to-tail.\nThe prompt text says \"Body: [(7, 8), (7, 9), ...]\".\nIf my head is `(7, 7)`, my body is `[(7, 8), (7, 9), ...]`.\nThis implies the body list represents the *current* state.\nHead: `(7, 7)` (Not in list).\nBody: `[(7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8)]`.\nThis matches the board.\nSo I am at `(7, 7)`.\nMy previous move must have landed me here.\nIf I came from `(7, 8)`, I moved DOWN.\nThat matches \"My last move information: DOWN\".\nSo the state is consistent.\n\nOkay, I am definitely at `(7, 7)`.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT.\n\nI will write the response now.\nI will include the reasoning and plan as requested.\nThen the move.\nThe move must be the last line.\nI will not write anything after the move word.My head is at (7, 7). Moving UP is blocked by my own body at (7, 8). Moving DOWN or LEFT are safe but do not secure an apple immediately. Moving RIGHT to (8, 7) allows me to eat an apple right now and gain a point. This position is on the open right side of the board, away from the enemy snake on the left, making it a safe and rewarding move.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat the apple at (8, 7). From there, move DOWN to sweep the bottom of the board for the apple at (7, 1), keeping away from the enemy snake on the left wall.\n\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "First, I need to understand the current board state and my position. I'm the snake with ID 0, and my head is at (9, 7). My body segments are: (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8). So, my body occupies these coordinates. Apples are at (7, 1), (5, 7), (4, 7), (1, 8), (3, 5). The enemy snake #1 has its head at (3, 7) and body extending to the left and up.\n\nFrom the board representation:\n- Row 9: T T T T . . . T T T\n- Row 8: T A . T . . . T . T\n- Row 7: T . . 1 A A . T T 0\n- Row 6: T . . . . . . . . .\n- Row 5: T . . A . . . . . .\n- Row 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n- Row 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n- Row 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n- Row 1: . . . . . . . A . .\n- Row 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nHere, 'T' represents a snake body part, 'A' is an apple, '1' is snake #1 head, '0' is my head. So, in row 7, from left to right: T, ., ., 1, A, A, ., T, T, 0. This means at (3,7) is snake #1 head, (4,7) and (5,7) are apples, (7,7) and (8,7) are my body parts, and (9,7) is my head.\n\nMy head is at (9,7). The directions I can move: UP to (9,8), DOWN to (9,6), LEFT to (8,7), RIGHT to (10,7) which is outside the board since x goes from 0 to 9.\n\nSo, RIGHT is invalid because it's off the board. I cannot move RIGHT.\n\nNow, check other directions:\n\n- UP to (9,8): From the board, row 8 at x=9 is 'T' from the row 8 description: \"T A . T . . . T . T\" \u2013 let's parse this carefully. The board has columns 0 to 9. So, row 8: \n  - x=0: T\n  - x=1: A\n  - x=2: .\n  - x=3: T\n  - x=4: .\n  - x=5: .\n  - x=6: .\n  - x=7: T\n  - x=8: .\n  - x=9: T\n\nSo, at (9,8) it's 'T', which is a snake body part. From my body list, (9,8) is indeed part of my body? Wait, my body segments: (8,7), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8). So, (9,8) is the second last segment, so it's my own body. Therefore, moving UP to (9,8) would mean my head moves into my own body, which would kill me. So, UP is not safe.\n\n- DOWN to (9,6): Row 6, x=9: from row 6, \"T . . . . . . . . .\" \u2013 so x=9 is '.' (empty). Is there any snake body? From my body, no segments at (9,6). Enemy snake #1 body is mostly on the left side, from (3,8) to (0,5), so (9,6) is empty. So, DOWN to (9,6) seems safe.\n\n- LEFT to (8,7): Row 7, x=8: from row 7, \"T . . 1 A A . T T 0\" \u2013 let's index: x=0: T, x=1: ., x=2: ., x=3: 1, x=4: A, x=5: A, x=6: ., x=7: T, x=8: T, x=9: 0. So, at x=8, it's 'T', which is my body part? From my body, (8,7) is the first body segment, so it's my own body. Moving LEFT to (8,7) would be moving into my own body, which is not allowed because it's directly adjacent? Wait, the rule says: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" And specifically, \"moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself.\" Here, from (9,7) to (8,7), since my body is behind me, moving left would be moving into the segment immediately behind my head, so yes, that would kill me. So, LEFT is not safe.\n\nBut in the last rationale, it said \"Down, Left, and Right are safe.\" But according to my analysis, LEFT is into my body, and RIGHT is off board. So, only DOWN is safe? But let's double-check.\n\nFrom the body list: head is (9,7), body starts with (8,7), so (8,7) is directly behind the head. So moving left from (9,7) to (8,7) is indeed moving into the immediate next segment of the body, so it's suicidal. Similarly, moving right to (10,7) is off board.\n\nMoving up to (9,8): from body list, (9,8) is a segment, so yes, that's also into own body.\n\nSo, only moving down to (9,6) appears safe.\n\nBut in the last move, I moved RIGHT? Wait, the last move information says I moved RIGHT to (8,7)? But from the current state, my head is at (9,7), so if I moved right from (8,7) to (9,7), that would make sense. Let's see the last rationale: it says \"Current head is (7,7).\" Wait, no, it says \"Current head is (7,7)\" but in the current state, head is (9,7). There's inconsistency.\n\nLooking back at the user's message: \"Your snake (ID 0): - Head: (9, 7)\" and the last rationale says \"Current head is (7,7).\" This is confusing. Probably, the last move was made, and now after that move, the head is at (9,7). In the last rationale, it mentioned moving RIGHT to (8,7) and then DOWN, but that seems from previous state.\n\nPerhaps I should ignore the last rationale and focus on the current state as given.\n\nSo, current head: (9,7)\n\nBody: [(8,7), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,9), (9,9), (9,8)]\n\nSo, moving:\n- UP: to (9,8) \u2192 which is (9,8) in body? From list, (9,8) is there, so yes, moving into own body \u2192 die.\n- DOWN: to (9,6) \u2192 is it occupied? From board, row 6, x=9 is '.' from the representation: \"T . . . . . . . . .\" for row 6, so x=9 is empty. Also, from snake body, no segment at (9,6). So, safe.\n- LEFT: to (8,7) \u2192 (8,7) is the first body segment, so immediately behind head, so moving into own body \u2192 die.\n- RIGHT: to (10,7) \u2192 x=10 is beyond 9, so off board \u2192 die.\n\nSo, only DOWN is safe.\n\nBut is that correct? Let's confirm with the board: from row 7, at x=9, it's '0', my head. Moving down, row 6, x=9: from row 6, it's '.' as per the list: columns 0 to 9, row 6: T at x=0, then dots, so x=9 is dot. Also, no snake body there. Enemy snake is on the left, so yes.\n\nSo, only move is DOWN.\n\nBut in the last rationale, it mentioned moving down to sweep for apple at (7,1), but currently, I'm at (9,7), so moving down is the only option.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the turn number: Turn 29, and I have 7 apples, enemy has 9. I need to strategize.\n\nBut for this turn, only DOWN is safe. So, I should move DOWN.\n\nBut let's think if there are any other possibilities. Is there any chance that moving down might lead to immediate death? For example, if another snake moves into that cell simultaneously? But since I'm moving simultaneously, I need to consider where the enemy snake might move.\n\nEnemy snake #1 head at (3,7). It can move in four directions. From the board, around (3,7): \n- UP to (3,8): from row 8, x=3 is 'T' (from row 8: x=3 is T), so that's occupied? But is it enemy body? Let's see enemy body: head (3,7), body: (3,8), (3,9), (2,9), (1,9), (0,9), (0,8), (0,7), (0,6), (0,5). So, (3,8) is part of its own body. So, if it moves UP, it would hit its own body? But wait, moving UP from (3,7) to (3,8) \u2013 since its body is at (3,8), it would be moving into its own body, so that would kill it. But perhaps it might not move UP if it knows that.\n\nSimilarly, DOWN to (3,6): from row 6, x=3 is '.' (row 6: T . . . . . . . . . so x=3 is dot). Is there any snake body? Enemy body is mostly at x=0, so (3,6) is empty. So, it could move DOWN safely.\n\nLEFT to (2,7): from row 7, x=2 is '.' (row 7: T . . 1 A A . T T 0, so x=2 is '.'). But is there any snake? Enemy body at x=0, so (2,7) is empty? But from enemy body, it has segments at (3,8), (3,9), (2,9), etc., but (2,7) is not listed, so probably empty. So, LEFT might be safe.\n\nRIGHT to (4,7): from row 7, x=4 is 'A' (apple), so if it moves there, it might eat the apple, but is it safe? From the body, no segment at (4,7), so yes, it can move to (4,7) without dying.\n\nBut importantly, for my move, I need to see if the enemy might move into the cell I'm moving to. I'm moving DOWN to (9,6). The enemy is at (3,7), so it's far away. It's unlikely to move to (9,6) because that's on the opposite side. So, probably no collision.\n\nTherefore, moving DOWN to (9,6) should be safe.\n\nBut is there any apple at (9,6)? From apples: (7,1), (5,7), (4,7), (1,8), (3,5). So, (9,6) has no apple, so I won't eat an apple this turn.\n\nBut that's fine, since I need to stay alive.\n\nPerhaps I should consider long-term strategy. I have 7 apples, enemy has 9. I need to catch up. There are apples on the board: (7,1), (5,7), (4,7), (1,8), (3,5). But from my position at (9,7), I might go for the apples at (5,7) or (4,7), but they are on the left side, and my body is kind of blocking the way.\n\nCurrently, my body is from (9,7) to (7,7), (7,8), etc., so if I move down, I can start navigating towards the left, but I have to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nBut for this turn, since only DOWN is safe, I have to move DOWN.\n\nWait, is there another safe move? Let's recheck.\n\nFrom head (9,7):\n- UP: (9,8) \u2192 occupied by my body? From body list, (9,8) is there, so yes, occupied by own body \u2192 die.\n- DOWN: (9,6) \u2192 empty? Yes.\n- LEFT: (8,7) \u2192 occupied by my body? (8,7) is the first body segment, so yes \u2192 die.\n- RIGHT: (10,7) \u2192 off board \u2192 die.\n\nSo, only DOWN.\n\nBut in the last rationale, it said \"Down, Left, and Right are safe.\" But that was from a different position? Perhaps the last move was from (7,7) to (9,7) via RIGHT? But the last move was RIGHT, and from (7,7) to (8,7) to (9,7)? No, the last move was from (7,7) to (8,7)? But in the current state, head is (9,7), so it seems after moving RIGHT from (8,7) to (9,7)? I'm confused.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'll stick to the current state provided.\n\nSo, based on current state, only DOWN is safe.\n\nTherefore, I should move DOWN.\n\nBut let's think about the apple at (5,7) or (4,7). I might want to go towards that, but from (9,7), if I move DOWN to (9,6), then I can move LEFT to (8,6), then LEFT to (7,6), etc., to approach from below.\n\nBut for now, only DOWN.\n\nSo, my move is DOWN.\n\nBut the user said \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\" So, I need to output just DOWN.\n\nBut before that, I should explain my reasoning, as per the instructions.\n\nSo, in my response, I can think out loud.\n\nAlso, I need to consider if moving down might lead to a dead-end later, but since it's the only move, I have to take it.\n\nPerhaps I can write a long-term plan.\n\nBut for this turn, I think DOWN is the only option.\n\nSo, I'll go with DOWNBased on the current board state, my snake's head is at (9, 7). I need to evaluate each possible move:\n\n- **UP to (9, 8)**: This cell is occupied by my own body segment (as per my body list: (9, 8) is part of my tail). Moving here would cause me to die.\n- **DOWN to (9, 6)**: This cell is empty on the board (row 6, x=9 is '.') and not occupied by any snake body. It is a safe move.\n- **LEFT to (8, 7)**: This cell is directly behind my head and is part of my own body (segment (8, 7)). Moving here would cause me to die.\n- **RIGHT to (10, 7)**: This is outside the board (x=10 is invalid), so moving here would cause me to die.\n\nThus, the only safe move is DOWN. This keeps me alive and allows me to position myself for future moves, such as navigating toward apples like (7, 1) or others on the board.\n\n**Long-term plan**: After moving down, I plan to move left toward the center of the board to access apples like (5, 7) or (4, 7), while avoiding the enemy snake and my own body. I'll prioritize paths that maintain multiple escape routes and avoid tight spaces.\n\nDOWN",

The board state confirms these coordinates (marked as 'T' for tail/body).\n\nI must evaluate the four potential moves:\n\n1.  **UP to (9, 6):**\n    *   Check board: Row 6, Col 9 is 'T' in the provided board state.\n    *   Check body: My body list explicitly includes (9, 6) as the first body segment.\n    *   Result: **DEAD** (Collision with self).\n\n2.  **DOWN to (9, 4):**\n    *   Check board: Row 4, Col 9 is '.' (empty).\n    *   Check body: (9, 4) is not in my body list.\n    *   Check enemy: Snake #1 is at (4, 6).\n    *   Result: **SAFE**.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (8, 5):**\n    *   Check board: Row 5, Col 8 is '.' (empty).\n    *   Check body: (8, 5) is not in my body list.\n    *   Check enemy: (8, 5) is not occupied by Snake #1.\n    *   Result: **SAFE**.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (10, 5):**\n    *   Check board: X=10 is outside the 0-9 range.\n    *   Result: **DEAD** (Out of bounds).\n\n**Comparison of Safe Moves (DOWN vs LEFT):**\n\n*   **Position after LEFT (8, 5):** This places me closer to the center and potential apples (e.g., (7, 1), (5, 7)). It opens up paths to the left side of the board.\n*   **Position after DOWN (9, 4):** This moves me to the bottom right corner.\n*   **Safety Analysis:**\n    *   My body is currently covering the right side of the board (columns 7-9) and rows 7-9.\n    *   Moving **LEFT** to (8, 5) avoids the tight corner and moves toward the center.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** to (9, 4) keeps me pinned against the right wall.\n    *   Let's check immediate future options for the LEFT move:\n        *   From (8, 5), I can go UP (8, 6 - currently empty), DOWN (8, 4 - currently empty), or LEFT (7, 5 - currently empty). I cannot go RIGHT (back into self). This gives me 3 safe exits.\n    *   Let's check immediate future options for the DOWN move (assuming I go to 9,4):\n        *   From (9, 4), I can go LEFT (8, 4 - empty), DOWN (9, 3 - empty), or UP (9, 5 - becomes self after turn). This gives me 2-3 safe exits, but keeps me near the wall.\n\n**Strategic Plan:**\nThe goal is to survive and eventually eat apples like (7, 1) or (5, 7). Moving LEFT towards the center is crucial. Staying in the corner (DOWN) is risky long-term. The LEFT move offers better connectivity to the rest of the board.\n\n**Conclusion:** Both LEFT and DOWN are immediately safe. However, LEFT is the superior move because it moves the snake toward the center of the board and away from the crowded right edge, maximizing future maneuverability.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

This cell is empty, brings us one step closer to the apple at (5,7), and stays clear of the enemy\u2019s likely movement (its head at (9,5) cannot reach x\u202f=\u202f5 in a single turn). After moving RIGHT we will have the option to go UP next turn to collect that apple, and we will still have room to maneuver in the open area on the right side of the board.\n\n**Plan for the next few turns:**  \n1. Move RIGHT now to (5,6).  \n2. On the following turn, go UP to (5,7) and eat the apple there, increasing our apple count.  \n3. Keep the head oriented upward or rightward while watching the enemy\u2019s head at (9,5); avoid moving into any cell that could become its next head position.  \n4.

This means the segment at (9, 5) was the tail, which will vacate this turn. The segment at (8, 5) is my new head. The segment at (9, 6) is now directly behind my head at (8, 5). The snake body listed in the prompt represents the state *after* my move.\n\n**Move Evaluation (from Head (8, 5)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (8, 6):**\n    *   Check Board: Row 6, Col 8 is '.'

This is the segment directly behind my head at (8, 5).\n    *   **Rule:** Moving directly backwards into the space just vacated by the tail is illegal/hits self.\n    *   **Result: DEAD.**\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **Move UP (to 8,6):** Moves closer to Enemy 1 (at 5,6) and apples at (5,7) and (1,8). Creates a potential clash if Enemy 1 moves towards (5,7) or (8,6).\n*   **Move DOWN (to 8,4):** Moves towards apples at (7,1) and (2,1). Clears the way to the bottom of the board.\n*   **Move LEFT (to 7,5):** Moves towards the center of the board and apples at (5,7) and (7,1). This puts me directly next to the empty space at (7,6) and (6,5).\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nEnemy 1 is at (5,6). They are likely hunting the apple at (5,7) which is just North of them. If I go UP to (8,6), I am not directly contesting that apple, but I am moving into the same row as the enemy. However, the empty space at (7,6) (immediate Left of my potential UP move) is very valuable.\n\nLet's look at the connectivity of **LEFT (7,5)** vs **UP (8,6)**.\n*   From (7,5): I have exits to (6,5), (7,4), (7,6). (7,6) is open and leads to the apple at (5,7).\n*   From (8,6): I have exits to (8,7) [blocked by my body], (8,5) [blocked by my body next turn], (7,6), (9,6) [blocked]. So from (8,6), I effectively only have (7,6) and (9,6). (9,6) is blocked by my own body. So I would be trapped moving to (8,6).\n\nTherefore, **LEFT** is the only move that maintains mobility. Moving UP puts me against the wall with limited exits (only (7,6) is viable, as (9,6) is my body and (8,7) is my body). Moving LEFT to (7,5) keeps me centrally located.\n\nAdditionally, considering the enemy at (5,6) and the apple at (5,7), moving LEFT positions me to potentially contest the center or wait for the enemy to pass. Moving UP brings me into range of the enemy's potential path immediately.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   UP: Traps me against the wall and body (limited exits).\n*   DOWN: Safe but isolates me in the bottom right corner away from the central apple.\n*   LEFT: Safe, opens up multiple paths (Left, Down, Up), and keeps me centrally located.\n*   RIGHT: Dead.\n\nThe correct move is LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

(empty).\n    *   Check Self: (7, 4) is not in my body.\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n    *   *Strategy:* Moves toward apples at (7, 1) and (2, 1). Keeps me in the lower board.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 5):**\n    *   Check Board: Row 5, Col 6 is '.' (empty).\n    *   Check Self: (6, 5) is not in my body.\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n    *   *Strategy:* Moves toward the apple at (5, 7) (diagonal) and (3, 5) (West). Opens up access to the left side.\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 5):**\n    *   Check Board: Row 5, Col 8 is 'T' (Body/Tail).\n    *   Check Self: (8, 5) is the segment immediately behind my head. This is the standard \"backwards\" move.\n    *   **Result: DEAD.**\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nEnemy 1 is at (5, 7), directly adjacent to the apple at (5, 7) to their North. They will almost certainly move **UP** to (5, 8) to eat the apple and grow.\n*   If I move **UP** to (7, 6), I am setting up to contest the center. If Enemy 1 moves UP to (5, 8), I am safely distant but positioned to potentially intercept if they turn West afterward. (7, 6) is a very strong central position.\n*   If I move **LEFT** to (6, 5), I approach the apple at (3, 5) but move slightly away from the action at (5, 7).\n*   If I move **DOWN** to (7, 4), I am safe but isolated.\n\nComparing **UP** and **LEFT**:\n*   From (7, 6): Neighbors are (6, 6), (8, 6), (7, 5), (7, 7). Only (7, 7) is blocked by my body (the segment behind me will be at (7, 5)). This is high mobility.\n*   From (6, 5): Neighbors are (5, 5), (7, 5), (6, 4), (6, 6). (7, 5) is blocked. Good mobility.\n\nMoving **UP** claims the center lane. It puts me in position to potentially chase the apple at (1, 8) or turn down towards (2, 1) later if needed. Given the enemy is moving into the apple at (5, 7), moving to (7, 6) prepares me to move deeper into the board while maintaining distance. I will move UP.\n\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Avoid getting trapped in the top-right corner. Watch Enemy 1 at (5, 8); they will likely eat the apple at (5, 9). Do not contest that apple directly. Instead, path towards the safer apples on the left side of the board.\n\n**Move:**\nLEFT\n\n**Final check:**\nHead: (7, 6).\nMove: LEFT to (6, 6).\nMap check: (6, 6) is `.`.\nBody check: (6, 6) is not in my body list `[(7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7)]`.\nEnemy check: Enemy is at (5, 8) and associated body. (6, 6) is safe.\nWall check: x=6 is inside 0-9.\nResult: SAFE.\n\nWhy not UP?\nUP to (7, 7) is also safe. But (7, 7) is the current tail. Moving into the tail is a standard maneuver.\nHowever, (6, 6) is better because it moves me away from the wall and the existing body mass, and opens up the path to (3, 5).\n\nLet's double check the `Last Move Information` provided by the user.\n`My last move information: -- **START LAST MOVE PICK** UP **END LAST MOVE PICK**`\n`Head: (7, 6)`\n`Body: [(7, 5), ...]`\nWait, the user prompt says `Head: (7, 6)` and `Body: [(7, 5), ...]` in the \"Your snake (ID: 0)\" section.\nAnd the board state shows `0` at (7, 6).\nAnd the \"Board State\" section shows the result of the move?\nWait, `Turn: 34 / 150`.\nThe \"Your last move information\" section describes the move *made* to get to the state shown.\nSo the state shown IS the result of the UP move.\nWait.\n`--Your last move information:--`\n`**START LAST MOVE PICK** UP **END LAST MOVE PICK**`\n`**START LAST RATIONALE** ... **END LAST RATIONALE**`\n`UP`\n`**END LAST RATIONALE**`\n\nAnd then it gives the current state:\n`Head: (7, 6)`\n`Body: [(7, 5), ...]`\n`Board State: ... 0 at (7,6) ...`\n\nSo the current state is *after* the UP move to (7, 6).\nSo the \"tail\" of the previous turn (which was at (7, 7) in the previous turn's body list?) is gone?\nNo.\nPrevious turn state (inferred):\nHead was (8, 5) (from rationale).\nMoved UP to (7, 5). No, wait.\nRationale says: \"My Last Move: LEFT from (8, 5) to (7, 5).\" -> No, that was *previous* previous turn?\nLet's re-read the provided Rationale carefully.\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\n...\n\"My Last Move: LEFT from (8, 5) to (7, 5). The tail at (9, 5) vacates this turn.\"\n\"My Snake (ID 0): Head at (7, 5).\"\n...\n\"Move Evaluation (from Head (7, 5)):\"\n...\n\"UP to (7, 6): ... **Result: SAFE.**\"\n...\n\"I will move UP.\"\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nSo the *previous* turn (Turn 33) ended with the snake at:\nHead (7, 5).\nBody: (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8)? No, the list provided in the prompt for the *current* state (Turn 34) is `Head: (7, 6), Body: [(7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7)]`.\nThis matches the \"UP\" move logic: Head moves from (7, 5) to (7, 6). Old head becomes body[0]. Tail (7, 8?) shrinks?\nWait, the list says tail is (7, 7).\nThe list in the prompt `Body: [... (8, 7), (7, 7)]` confirms the current tail is (7, 7).\n\nSo, for Turn 34 (Current State):\nHead: (7, 6)\nBody: (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7) [Tail]\n\nThis matches the `Board State` (ASCII map).\nMap snippet:\nRow 6: `. . . . T T . 0 . T`\nRow 7: `. . . T T T . T T T`\n\nCheck map against list:\n(7, 6) -> `0`. OK.\n(7, 5) -> Row 5, Col 7. Row 5: `. . . A . . . T T T`. Index 7 is `T`. OK.\n(8, 5) -> Index 8 is `T`. OK.\n(9, 5) -> Index 9 is `T`. OK.\n(9, 6) -> Row 6, Index 9 is `T`. OK.\n(9, 7) -> Row 7, Index 9 is `T`. OK.\n(8, 7) -> Row 7, Index 8 is `T`. OK.\n(7, 7) -> Row 7, Index 7 is `T`. OK.\n\nSo the provided state is consistent.\n\nNow I am at Turn 35.\nI need to choose a move from (7, 6).\nThe analysis I performed earlier is valid based on this state.\n\nRe-evaluating the \"Tail\" logic:\nMy tail is at (7, 7).\nIf I move UP to (7, 7), the tail moves away (to (8, 7) or vanishes).\nWait, the tail at (7, 7) is connected to (8, 7).\nSo if I move UP, (7, 7) is vacated.\nIs (7, 7) currently occupied? Yes, by my tail.\nIs it safe to move there? Yes, because the tail moves.\n\nRe-evaluating the \"Backwards\" logic:\nHead (7, 6).\nNeck (7, 5).\nMoving DOWN to (7, 5) is backwards/dead.\n\nRe-evaluating the options:\nUP (7, 7): Safe. (Occupied by tail).\nLEFT (6, 6): Safe. (Empty).\nRIGHT (8, 6): Safe. (Empty).\n\nStrategic re-confirmation:\nI want to avoid the top-right corner.\nMy body occupies the far right (x=9) and top (y=7).\nMoving UP (7, 7) keeps me in the top row area (y=7).\nMoving LEFT (6, 6) moves me out towards the center.\nMoving DOWN is dead.\nMoving RIGHT (8, 6) moves me closer to the wall (x=9).\n\nThe apples are:\n(7, 1) - Bottom Right.\n(1, 8) - Top Left.\n(3, 5) - Center Left.\n(2, 1) - Bottom Left.\n(5, 9) - Top Center (contested).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 6):\nI am at (6, 6).\nI can go DOWN to (6, 5) -> (6, 4) -> (6, 3) -> (6, 2) -> (6, 1) -> (7, 1) (Apple). This is a long path but possible.\nI can go LEFT to (5, 6) -> Blocked by Enemy.\nI can go LEFT to (5, 6) is blocked. I can go LEFT to (4, 6) is blocked.\nSo I can't go directly left.\nBut from (6, 6) I can go DOWN, then LEFT.\nFrom (6, 5):\nLeft (5, 5) is empty.\nLeft (4, 5) is empty.\nLeft (3, 5) is **APPLE**.\nSo (6, 6) -> (6, 5) -> (5, 5) -> (4, 5) -> (3, 5). That's 4 moves.\nDistance to (3, 5) is `|6-3| + |6-5| = 3 + 1 = 4`.\nFrom (7, 6), distance is `|7-3| + |6-5| = 4 + 1 = 5`.\nSo LEFT reduces distance to (3, 5) by 1.\n\nIf I move UP to (7, 7):\nI am at (7, 7).\nDistance to (3, 5) is `|7-3| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6`. (Worse).\nDistance to (5, 9) is `|7-5| + |7-9| = 2 + 2 = 4`.\nDistance to (1, 8) is `|7-1| + |7-8| = 6 + 1 = 7`.\n\nSo UP is better for (5, 9).\nLEFT is better for (3, 5).\n\n**Crucial Point:** Enemy 1 is at (5, 8).\nIf Enemy 1 moves UP to (5, 9), they eat the apple.\nIf they eat the apple, (5, 9) becomes their head, and their tail (0, 8) stays.\nChasing (5, 9) becomes dangerous because the enemy is there.\nAlso, (5, 9) is only 1 apple.\n(3, 5) is also 1 apple.\n(2, 1) is 1 apple.\n(7, 1) is 1 apple.\n(1, 8) is 1 apple.\n\nIf I go LEFT, I can start a safe path to (3, 5).\nIf I go UP, I rush (5, 9) but the enemy is already adjacent to it.\nUnless the enemy makes a mistake, I won't get (5, 9).\nTherefore, I should ignore (5, 9) and focus on other apples.\n\n(3, 5) and (2, 1) are in the bottom/left area.\n(1, 8) is top left.\n(7, 1) is bottom right.\n\nIf I go LEFT, I position myself to choose between (3, 5) (left) or (7, 1) (down/right).\nFrom (6, 6) -> (6, 5):\nCan go to (3, 5) or (7, 1).\nFrom (6, 6) -> (7, 7) (Wait, I can't go right to (7, 6) - blocked).\nFrom (6, 6) -> (6, 7) (Up).\nUp path: (6, 7) -> (6, 8) -> (6, 9) -> (5, 9).\nIf Enemy eats (5, 9), I can't go there.\nSo UP path (from (6, 6)) leads to a dead end if Enemy eats (5, 9).\nSo if I go LEFT to (6, 6), I should plan to go DOWN to (6, 5) next turn.\nFrom (6, 5), I am at y=5.\nFrom y=5, I can access (3, 5) (Apple) or go DOWN to (7, 1).\n\n**Decision:** LEFT.\n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to (6, 6). Next turn, move DOWN to (6, 5) to open paths to (3, 5) and (7, 1). Avoid the top-right corner.\n\n**Final check:**\nIs (6, 6) definitely empty?\nMap Row 6: `. . . . T T . 0 . T`\nIndices 0-3: `....`\nIndices 4-5: `TT` (Enemy body).\nIndex 6: `.` (Empty).\nIndex 7: `0` (Me).\nIndex 8: `.` (Empty).\nIndex 9: `T` (My body).\nSo (6, 6) is Empty. Correct.\n\nIs it safe?\nEnemy body is at (4,6) and (5,6).\nEnemy head at (5,8).\nNo collision.\n\nIs it backwards?\nHead (7, 6). Neck (7, 5).\nLeft is (6, 6). Not backwards.\n\nIs it off board?\nx=6 is valid.\n\nResult: LEFT.\n\nOne final check: What if Enemy 1 moves DOWN? It can't.\nWhat if Enemy 1 moves LEFT? Can't.\nWhat if Enemy 1 moves RIGHT?\nTarget (6, 8).\nCurrent state:\nMy head (7, 6).\nEnemy head (5, 8).\nIf Enemy moves RIGHT to (6, 8), and I move LEFT to (6, 6).\nDistance between heads: (6, 6) and (6, 8) is 2. Safe.\nIf Enemy moves UP to (5, 9), and I move LEFT to (6, 6). Safe.\n\nWhat if I move UP to (7, 7)?\nIf Enemy moves RIGHT to (6, 8):\nMy head (7, 7), Enemy head (6, 8). Distance 1. Collision? No, adjacent.\nIf Enemy moves UP to (5, 9):\nMy head (7, 7), Enemy head (5, 9). Distance 3. Safe.\n\nBoth are safe.\nBut LEFT offers better strategic pathing for apples (3, 5) and avoids the corner.\nUP offers pathing towards (5, 9) which is likely taken.\n\nSo LEFT is the correct choice.\n\nOne minor detail: The prompt says \"Turn: 34 / 150\".\nUsually turns are 1-indexed or 0-indexed.\nIf it's 34, and max is 150, there are plenty of turns left.\nStrategy should be long-term.\nGetting trapped in the corner is a long-term failure.\nMoving LEFT mitigates this.\n\nThe plan is solid.\n\nFinal output format:\nJust the word \"LEFT\".\n\nWait, the prompt says \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\"\nAnd \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\n\nI will provide the reasoning then the word.\n\nReasoning summary:\n1.  Analyze current position (7, 6) and body.\n2.  Check immediate safety: UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe. DOWN is backwards/dead.\n3.  Evaluate apples: (5, 9) is contested by Enemy 1 (adjacent). (3, 5) is free.\n4.  Evaluate paths:\n    *   UP (7, 7) -> leads to top/right corner, contested (5, 9).\n    *   LEFT (6, 6) -> leads to center, access to (3, 5), (7, 1).\n5.  Decision: LEFT is better for board control and safety.\n\nDrafting the response.\nI will include the plan as requested.\n\"Plan: Move left to open up paths to the central and lower apples. Avoid the top-right corner.\"\n\nFinal check on the rule: \"If you move directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nHead (7, 6). Behind is (7, 5).\nLeft is (6, 6). OK.\n\nDouble check the `Apples at` list.\n(7, 1), (1, 8), (3, 5), (2, 1), (5, 9).\n(5, 9) is at x=5, y=9.\nMy head is at (7, 6).\nEnemy is at (5, 8).\nEnemy is 1 unit away from (5, 9).\nI am 3 units away (x diff 2, y diff 3).\nI cannot win that race if the enemy plays optimally (moves UP).\nSo I should ignore (5, 9).\n\nMoving LEFT facilitates (3, 5) and (2, 1) and (7, 1).\n(3, 5) is 4 units away.\n(7, 1) is 5 units away.\n(2, 1) is 8 units away.\n(1, 8) is 4 units away.\n\nWait, distance to (1, 8):\nFrom (7, 6): |7-1| + |6-8| = 6 + 2 = 8.\nFrom (6, 6): |6-1| + |6-8| = 5 + 2 = 7.\nFrom (7, 7): |7-1| + |7-8| = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo (1, 8) is roughly equidistant.\nBut the path to (1, 8) is blocked by Enemy Body (at x=3 to 5, y=7).\nI would have to go around, likely through (6, 7) -> (6, 8) -> (6, 9) -> ...\nBut (5, 9) is on that path, and contested.\nSo (1, 8) is a bad target right now.\n(3, 5) is a good target.\n(7, 1) is a good target.\n\nLEFT supports both (3, 5) and (7, 1).\nUP supports (5, 9) (bad) and (1, 8) (bad).\n\nDecision: LEFT.\n\nOne detail: The enemy body list provided is `[(5, 7), (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9), (2, 9), (1, 9), (0, 9), (0, 8)]`.\n(3, 7) is body.\n(3, 8) is body.\n(3, 9) is body.\nSo the column x=3 is blocked for y=7, 8, 9.\nThis blocks the path to (1, 8) if I stay high.\nIf I go LEFT, I can stay low.\nIf I go UP, I am forced to stay high or go around the right side of the enemy (x>5).\nIf I go around the right side (x=6, 7, 8, 9), I am in the corner.\nSo UP is a trap.\n\nLEFT is freedom.\n\nFinal Answer seems to be LEFT.\n\nOne sanity check on the ASCII map vs Text data.\nText: `Head: (7, 6)`\nMap: `6 ... . 0 . T` (Index 7 is 0).\nText: `Body: [(7, 5), ...]`\nMap: `5 ... . T T T` (Index 7 is T).\nText: `Body: [(8, 5), ...]`\nMap: `5 ... . T T T` (Index 8 is T).\nText: `Body: [(9, 5), ...]`\nMap: `5 ... .

T T T` (Index 7 is T).\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Body: [(7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7), (7, 7)]\".\nThis is a list of 7 body parts.\nWait, usually \"Body\" excludes the head.\nSo the snake has 1 Head + 7 Body parts = 8 segments total.\nThe last element is the tail.\nSo (7, 7) is the tail.\n\nIf I move UP to (7, 7), I move into the tail.\nThe tail moves to (8, 7).\n(8, 7) is currently body. The body segment at (8, 7) moves to (9, 7)?\nWait, let's trace the shift if I don't eat.\nHead: (7, 6) -> (7, 7).\nBody[0]: (7, 5) -> (7, 6).\nBody[1]: (8, 5) -> (7, 5).\nBody[2]: (9, 5) -> (8, 5).\nBody[3]: (9, 6) -> (9, 5).\nBody[4]: (9, 7) -> (9, 6).\nBody[5]: (8, 7) -> (9, 7).\nBody[6]: (7, 7) -> (8, 7).\nResult:\nHead (7, 7).\nBody: (7, 6), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7).\nTail: (8, 7).\n\nIs (8, 7) currently occupied?\nMap: `7 ... . T T T` (Index 8 is T).\nYes, it's occupied by the current body part at index 5 of the body list.\nBut that body part moves to (9, 7).\nSo (8, 7) becomes the tail.\nIs it safe to move to (7, 7)?\nYes. (7, 7) is the *current* tail. It moves to (8, 7).\n(8, 7) is currently body, but moves to (9, 7).\nSo (8, 7) is safe (it's moving).\n(7, 7) is safe (it's moving).\n\nSo UP is definitely safe.\nBut is it *smart*?\nIt keeps me in the top right.\nMy new body will be `(7, 6), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7)`.\nThis is essentially the same shape, just shifted up by 1.\nI will be stuck in the corner.\nLEFT moves me out.\n\nSo LEFT.\n\nOne final check on LEFT.\nCurrent Head (7, 6).\nMove to (6, 6).\nNew Body:\n(7, 5) -> (7, 6) (Neck)\n(8, 5) -> (7, 5)\n(9, 5) -> (8, 5)\n(9, 6) -> (9, 5)\n(9, 7) -> (9, 6)\n(8, 7) -> (9, 7)\n(7, 7) -> (8, 7) (Tail)\nWait, the tail at (7, 7) moves to (8, 7).\nSo the new snake is:\nHead: (6, 6).\nBody: (7, 6), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (8, 7).\nTail: (8, 7).\n\nIs (6, 6) blocked by Enemy?\nEnemy body: (5, 6), (4, 6).\nSo (6, 6) is clear.\n\nIs (6, 6) blocked by Me?\nNew body starts at (7, 6). (6, 6) is not in the new body list.\nSo clear.\n\nIs (6, 6) blocked by Wall?\nNo.\n\nResult: Safe and Smart.\n\nFinal decision: LEFT.\n\nI will write the plan as requested.\n\"Plan: Move LEFT to (6, 6) to avoid the corner and position for (3, 5) or (7, 1).\"\n\nOne tiny detail: \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\nY increases UP. X increases RIGHT.\nMy move LEFT decreases X.\nCorrect.\n\nFinal output.\nLEFT\n\nWait, the instructions say \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo I should output:\n[Plan]\n[Move]\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to escape the corner and head towards the central apples (3, 5) and (2, 1). Watch out for Enemy #1 who is likely eating (5, 9).\n\nWait, the instructions say \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nSo:\n[Plan text]\n[Move text]\n\nExample:\n\"Plan: Move towards the center.\nLEFT\"\n\nOkay.\n\nJust to be 100% sure, let's verify the \"Last Move\" info provided by the user again.\n\"Head: (7, 6)\"\n\"Body: [(7, 5), ...]\"\nThis confirms the state.\n\nIs there any ambiguity in the \"Board state\" visual?\n`6 . . . .
