However, since I have no body, I can easily turn next turn.  \n\nUP and LEFT are risky but maybe enemy won\u2019t choose that direction. But I can\u2019t know that. Avoiding head-on collision is highest priority early game when no apples advantage exists.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Choose safest:\nDOWN is safest for survival this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (9, 1), I can go LEFT toward (8, 1) then up toward apples (7, 2) area.

LEFT gives more flexibility next turn.  \nI\u2019ll choose LEFT to move toward apples while keeping options open.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 1), consider enemy likely moving toward (7, 2) apple.

UP to (8,3): Contains an apple, but enemy head is at (7,3) now. Could enemy move to (8,3) same turn?  \n   - Enemy moves: from (7,3), possible: UP (7,4), DOWN (7,2) but that's its own body, so no. LEFT (6,3), RIGHT (8,3).  \n   - So enemy could move RIGHT to (8,3) same time I move UP to (8,3). That's head-on collision \u2192 both die. Risky.  \n   - Also (8,3) is within bounds. No other snake body there.  \n   - So UP is *possibly* deadly if enemy chooses RIGHT.\n\n2. DOWN to (8,1): Safe? In bounds, no apple, no snake body there, enemy can\u2019t reach (8,1) in one move from (7,3). Safe.\n\n3. LEFT to (7,2): Contains enemy body (tail of snake #1). That\u2019s snake #1\u2019s body segment \u2192 I die instantly. Eliminate.\n\n4. RIGHT to (9,2): In bounds, no apple, no snake body there. Enemy can\u2019t reach it in one move. Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT. UP is risky (possible head-on collision with snake #1 if it moves RIGHT).\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Evaluate safe moves for advantage:**  \n\nApples closest:  \n- (6,2) \u2013 2 cells away Manhattan from (8,2).  \n- (8,3) \u2013 1 cell away but risky.  \n- (8,5) \u2013 3 cells away.  \n\nDOWN (8,1): moves away from most apples except (6,2) is now 3 cells away Manhattan.  \nRIGHT (9,2): moves slightly closer to (9,6)/(9,7) long-term, but also away from (6,2).  \n\nFrom (8,1), next turn options open (UP back to (8,2), LEFT to (7,1), RIGHT to (9,1)).  \nFrom (9,2), next turn options open (UP to (9,3), DOWN to (9,1), LEFT to (8,2)).  \n\nBoth keep options open.  \n\nBut RIGHT (9,2) puts me near right edge\u2014could limit future moves if I go further right later.  \nDOWN (8,1) keeps me more central.  \n\nAlso, enemy is at (7,3), might go for apple at (8,3) or (6,2). If I go DOWN, I avoid conflict entirely this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Choose:**  \nI think DOWN is safest and keeps options open. RIGHT also safe, but DOWN avoids any possible enemy head-on even if enemy moves unpredictably.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (8,1), consider moving toward apple at (6,2) via LEFT twice, but watch enemy movement. Snake #1 might eat apple at (8,3) or (6,2) soon. Try to grab an apple safely without head-on risk.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Enemy head is at (8, 3), could move DOWN to (8, 2) same turn? Yes, enemy moves: from (8, 3), possible: UP (8, 4), DOWN (8, 2), LEFT (7, 3) (its own body), RIGHT (9, 3). So DOWN is possible for enemy. If we both move into (8, 2), head-on collision \u2192 both die. Risky.  \n\n2. **DOWN to (8, 0)** \u2013 In bounds, empty, enemy can\u2019t reach it in one move from (8, 3). Safe.  \n\n3. **LEFT to (7, 1)** \u2013 Empty, in bounds, enemy can\u2019t reach it in one move from (8, 3). Safe.  \n\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 1)** \u2013 Empty, in bounds, enemy can\u2019t reach it in one move. Safe.  \n\nSo UP is risky due to possible head-on collision if enemy moves DOWN. Others safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Evaluate safe moves for advantage:**  \n\nClosest apple: (6, 2) is 3 cells away Manhattan from (8, 1).  \n(9, 2) is 1 cell away from (9, 1) if I move RIGHT first.  \n(8, 5) is far.  \n\nFrom (8, 1):  \n- LEFT (7, 1) \u2192 then next turn could go UP to (7, 2) which is currently enemy tail (but enemy will move this turn, tail may move away).  \n- RIGHT (9, 1) \u2192 then next turn UP to (9, 2) gets apple.  \n- DOWN (8, 0) \u2192 moves away from all apples.  \n\nRIGHT seems good: gets me to (9, 1), next turn UP to (9, 2) apple unless enemy takes it first. Enemy is at (8, 3), could move RIGHT to (9, 3) or DOWN to (8, 2) etc. Apple at (9, 2) is closer to me next turn if I go RIGHT now.  \n\nLEFT (7, 1) also fine but farther from immediate apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Likely enemy movement prediction:**  \nEnemy head at (8, 3), body at (7, 3), (7, 2).  \nEnemy safe moves: UP (8, 4), DOWN (8, 2), RIGHT (9, 3). LEFT (7, 3) is its own body so not allowed.  \nEnemy might go DOWN to (8, 2) to chase apple (9, 2)? Actually apple at (9, 2) is two moves away for enemy. Apple at (6, 2) is closer for enemy? From (8, 3) to (6, 2) is 3 cells.  \nEnemy might go for (8, 5) apple eventually.  \n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (8, 2), then my UP is deadly. So avoid UP.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Choose:**  \nRIGHT (9, 1) sets up for (9, 2) apple next turn, keeps me safe this turn.  \nLEFT (7, 1) also safe but not as direct path to immediate apple.  \nDOWN (8, 0) wastes time.  \n\nBest: RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (9, 1), next turn likely UP to (9, 2) for apple unless enemy somehow gets there first. Watch enemy movement; if enemy moves RIGHT to (9, 3) this turn, then next turn it could go DOWN to (9, 2) same time I go UP \u2192 head-on collision risk. But enemy might not do that if it thinks I\u2019m going for it. Safer to go RIGHT now and reassess next turn.  \n\nRIGHT",

Check for collisions:  \n   - No body there now.  \n   - Enemy head at (8, 4) can move UP (8, 5), DOWN (8, 3), LEFT (7, 4), RIGHT (9, 4). So enemy cannot reach (9, 2) in one move.  \n   - No risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n   - Safe.  \n\n2. **DOWN to (9, 0)** \u2013 Empty, in bounds, enemy cannot reach in one move. Safe.  \n\n3. **LEFT to (8, 1)** \u2013 Empty, in bounds. Enemy can move DOWN to (8, 3), LEFT to (7, 4), etc. but not to (8, 1) directly. Safe.  \n\nAll three moves are safe from immediate death.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Evaluate for advantage:**  \n\nClosest apple: (9, 2) is 1 step away UP. Eating it now grows me to length 2.  \n\nEnemy at (8, 4) is close to apple (8, 5) (1 step UP for them). They might go for that, not my apple.  \n\nIf I go UP and eat apple (9, 2), my new head will be at (9, 2) with body at (9, 1). Next turn I\u2019ll have to avoid moving back into my new body.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (8, 1), I\u2019m farther from apples but maybe safer? Actually, from (8, 1) next turn I could go UP to (8, 2) toward apple (6, 2) or (9, 2) if still there. But (9, 2) might be gone if enemy moves to (9, 3) then DOWN next turn \u2014 but enemy is not near (9, 2) right now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Likely enemy movement:**  \nEnemy head at (8, 4), body at (8, 3), (7, 3).  \nPossible moves for enemy:  \n- UP (8, 5) \u2192 apple. Likely choice.  \n- DOWN (8, 3) \u2192 into its own body \u2192 illegal.  \n- LEFT (7, 4) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (9, 4) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo enemy likely UP to (8, 5) to eat apple, growing to length 4, body extends to (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3).  \n\nThat means enemy will not interfere with my move to (9, 2) this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Choose best move:**  \nUP gets apple immediately, grows to length 2, safe this turn.  \nNext turn from (9, 2) with body at (9, 1), possible moves: LEFT (8, 2), DOWN (9, 1) illegal (own body), RIGHT off board, UP (9, 3). So only LEFT or UP viable. That\u2019s slightly limiting but okay for now.  \n\nLEFT (8, 1) keeps me length 1, more freedom next turn but no apple.  \n\nGiven early game, growing faster is good. Also enemy is growing (already has 2 apples). Need to catch up.  \n\nBest: **UP** to eat (9, 2).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating apple at (9, 2), next turn I can go LEFT to (8, 2) to move toward center and avoid trap at top-right corner. From (8, 2) I can target apple (6, 2) or (8, 5) if still there. Watch enemy movement \u2014 they will likely be at (8, 5) with longer body after this turn.  \n\nUP",

Enemy body: (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3). (9, 3) is not in that list \u2192 safe from enemy body.  \n- Possible head-on collision? Enemy head at (8, 5) can move UP (8, 6), DOWN (8, 4), LEFT (7, 5), RIGHT (9, 5).  \nEnemy cannot reach (9, 3) in one move \u2192 no head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n**LEFT to (8, 2):**  \n- Not off board.  \n- Not my body (body at (9, 1)).  \n- Not enemy body (check list: none at (8, 2)).  \n- Possible head-on collision? Enemy from (8, 5) cannot reach (8, 2) in one move \u2192 safe.  \n\nBoth UP and LEFT are safe from immediate death this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider apples:**  \n\nClosest apples:  \nFrom my head (9, 2):  \n- (9, 4) is 2 steps away (UP, UP).  \n- (9, 6) and (9, 7) farther up column 9.  \n- (7, 7) and (6, 2) farther away.  \n\nFrom enemy head (8, 5): apples at (9, 7), (9, 6), (9, 4), (7, 7), (6, 2).  \nEnemy might go UP to (8, 6) toward (9, 7), or RIGHT to (9, 5) toward column 9 apples.  \n\nIf I go UP to (9, 3), next turn I\u2019m closer to (9, 4) but also closer to top edge (risk of trapping myself).  \nIf I go LEFT to (8, 2), next turn I can go UP to (8, 3) toward (9, 4) or LEFT to (7, 2) toward (6, 2).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future move options after each choice:**  \n\n**After UP to (9, 3):**  \nNext turn body: head at (9, 3), body at [(9, 2), (9, 1)].  \nPossible moves from (9, 3):  \n- UP \u2192 (9, 4) apple!  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 2) own body \u2192 illegal  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 3) enemy body? Enemy\u2019s body now includes (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3) but enemy will move this turn.  \nLet\u2019s predict enemy move: Enemy likely to go UP to (8, 6) for apple (9, 7) or RIGHT to (9, 5) toward apples. If enemy goes UP, then (8, 3) stays as enemy\u2019s old body next turn. So LEFT to (8, 3) would be into enemy body \u2192 death.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (9, 5), then (8, 3) still enemy body (old body at (8, 3) remains). So LEFT likely deadly next turn.  \nThus from (9, 3), only UP might be safe (if no head-on collision with enemy moving to (9, 4)), but enemy cannot reach (9, 4) from (8, 5) in one move? Wait, enemy at (8, 5) \u2192 RIGHT to (9, 5), then next turn can go DOWN to (9, 4). So not immediate threat. But from (9, 3), going UP to (9, 4) might be safe next turn.  \nStill, being at (9, 3) leaves only UP as possibly safe move next turn (LEFT risky, DOWN illegal). That\u2019s a trap.  \n\n**After LEFT to (8, 2):**  \nNext turn body: head at (8, 2), body at [(9, 2), (9, 1)].  \nPossible moves from (8, 2):  \n- UP \u2192 (8, 3) enemy body? Possibly, if enemy moves UP to (8, 6), old body stays at (8, 3) \u2192 deadly.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 1) empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 2) empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 2) own body \u2192 illegal.  \n\nSo from (8, 2), DOWN or LEFT likely safe, giving more options.  \n\nLEFT now gives more future flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Avoid corner trap:**  \nAt (9, 2), going UP funnels me into top-right corner with fewer exits. Going LEFT opens board.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nFrom (8, 2), target apple (6, 2) or (7, 7) eventually. Avoid enemy who is longer and may control top-right apples soon. Stay central for options.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** LEFT gives better future safety and options.  \n\nLEFT",

Possible moves from (7, 2):**  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 3)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 1)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 2)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 2)  \n\n---\n\n**2. Check immediate death for each:**  \n\n- **UP (7, 3)**:  \n  Within board: yes.  \n  Occupied by my body? No.  \n  Occupied by enemy body? Enemy body: (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 4), (7, 6), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 4). No.  \n  Safe for now.\n\n- **DOWN (7, 1)**:  \n  Within board: yes.  \n  My body? No.  \n  Enemy body? No.  \n  Safe.\n\n- **LEFT (6, 2)**:  \n  Within board: yes.  \n  My body? No.  \n  Enemy body? No.  \n  Contains apple? Yes, apple at (6, 2). Eating apple means I grow, so next turn my tail stays where it is (or extends by 1 cell at head after move). But importantly, moving onto apple is safe if cell is free now\u2014it is free.  \n\n- **RIGHT (8, 2)**:  \n  Within board: yes.  \n  My body? Yes! My body is [(8, 2)] currently. That\u2019s my own body segment (tail). Moving RIGHT would hit myself \u2192 death. So **RIGHT is not safe**.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n---\n\n**3. Consider enemy movement possibilities:**  \nEnemy head at (7, 6). Possible moves:  \nUP (7, 7) \u2013 apple there, but safe unless I go there (I\u2019m far away).  \nDOWN (7, 5) \u2013 its own body? (7, 5) is its neck, yes! That\u2019s the first body segment, so moving DOWN from (7, 6) to (7, 5) would hit itself \u2192 enemy wouldn\u2019t choose that if rational.  \nLEFT (6, 6) \u2013 safe? empty.  \nRIGHT (8, 6) \u2013 safe? empty.  \n\nEnemy likely won\u2019t suicide, so enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nWhere could enemy head be next turn?  \n(7, 7), (6, 6), or (8, 6).  \n\nNone conflict with my possible moves except if I go to (6, 2) or (7, 3) or (7, 1) \u2014 no overlap with those enemy destinations. So no head-on collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n\nFrom (7, 3): possible moves next turn: U/D/L/R, but need to avoid my body at (8, 2) and (7, 2) (old head position if I move? Wait: if I move UP to (7, 3), my body will be: head at (7, 3), then (7, 2), then (8, 2)?? No \u2014 my current body is head (7, 2), tail (8, 2). After moving without eating apple: new head at (7, 3), old head becomes body at (7, 2), tail stays at (8, 2)? No \u2014 snake movement: head moves to new cell, each body segment moves into previous segment\u2019s position. So: new head (7, 3), body[0] = old head (7, 2), body[1] = old tail (8, 2)? Wait, length=2 means body has 1 segment: [(8, 2)]. Actually: total segments = 2: head (7, 2), tail (8, 2). After moving UP without eating: new head (7, 3), tail disappears from (8, 2), body segments shift: old head (7, 2) becomes body segment 1. So new body = [(7, 2)], length still 2. So tail was at (8, 2), now gone, new tail at (7, 2). Yes.  \n\nSo after UP move, my body occupies (7, 2). So from (7, 3), blocked cells: (7, 2) down, others free.  \n\nFrom (6, 2) after eating apple:  \nIf I eat apple at (6, 2), I grow: new head at (6, 2), old head (7, 2) becomes body segment 1, old tail (8, 2) stays as tail. So length becomes 3, body = [(7, 2), (8, 2)].  \n\nFrom (7, 1) without eating: body = [(7, 2)], tail gone from (8, 2).  \n\n---\n\n**5. Apple proximity:**  \nLEFT (6, 2) is directly on apple \u2014 grow to length 3, good for score.  \nUP (7, 3) \u2014 not near apple now but opens board.  \nDOWN (7, 1) \u2014 moves away from apples.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term safety:**  \nEating apple now puts me at length 3 vs enemy length 4 (enemy has 3 apples eaten so length = 4 segments total). Still behind but catching up.  \n\nAlso, eating apple at (6, 2) means next turn my head is at (6, 2), body at (7, 2), (8, 2). That\u2019s not too trapped; from (6, 2) possible moves: U (6, 3), D (6, 1), L (5, 2), R (7, 2) but R is my body then \u2014 so 3 moves possible. Good.  \n\nUP (7, 3) also gives 3 moves possible next turn (avoid (7, 2)).  \n\nDOWN (7, 1) also gives 3 moves possible next turn (avoid (7, 2)).  \n\nSo all safe moves give good mobility next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**7. Strategy note:**  \nEnemy is longer, has more apples. Need to collect apples while avoiding future dead ends. Eating apple now is beneficial unless it leads into danger \u2014 but (6, 2) seems safe this turn and gives growth.  \n\nAlso, enemy could go to (7, 7) apple next turn, might be distracted.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nLEFT gets apple, safe now, good future mobility.  \nUP is safe but no apple.  \nDOWN safe but no apple and moves away from most apples.  \n\nBest: **LEFT** to gain apple and stay close to other apples (like (9, 4) etc. later).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 2) after eating, check moves avoiding body at (7, 2) and (8, 2). Prefer paths toward other apples while keeping distance from enemy head at (7, 6) or its possible next positions.  \n\nLEFT",

Possible moves from (6,3):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (6,4)  \n  Board shows empty at (6,4) (no apple, no snake). Safe?  \n  Enemy head is far away at (6,7), no collision possible unless enemy moves down to (6,6), but that\u2019s its own body segment, so enemy wouldn\u2019t move there (suicide). But wait: enemy could move DOWN from (6,7) to (6,6) only if they wanted to die (since (6,6) is their own body). So enemy won\u2019t do that.  \n  Possible enemy moves from (6,7): UP to (6,8) (empty), LEFT to (5,7) (empty), RIGHT to (7,7) (apple), DOWN to (6,6) (their body \u2192 suicide).  \n  So enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n  (6,4) is safe from immediate collision with enemy head because enemy can\u2019t reach it in one move from (6,7).  \n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6,2)  \n  That\u2019s my own body segment \u2192 suicide. Eliminate.\n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,3)  \n  Empty cell. Safe?  \n  Check enemy possible moves: can enemy reach (5,3) in one move? From (6,7), no.  \n  So safe.\n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,3)  \n  Empty cell. Safe?  \n  Enemy from (6,7) could move RIGHT to (7,7) (apple), but not to (7,3). So safe.\n\nSo all except DOWN are safe from immediate suicide.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Avoid head-on collisions this turn:\nEnemy head at (6,7).  \nMy possible moves: UP (6,4), LEFT (5,3), RIGHT (7,3).  \nEnemy possible moves: UP (6,8), LEFT (5,7), RIGHT (7,7), DOWN (6,6) (suicide, so unlikely unless they\u2019re dumb).  \n\nWill any of my safe moves land on same cell as enemy\u2019s move?  \nCheck overlap:\n\n- If I go UP to (6,4), enemy can\u2019t be there (too far).  \n- If I go LEFT to (5,3), enemy can\u2019t be there.  \n- If I go RIGHT to (7,3), enemy could only be there if they move DOWN 4 times \u2014 impossible.  \n\nSo no risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Which move helps toward apples?\nApples: (9,7), (9,6), (9,4), (7,7), (2,9)  \n\nFrom my head (6,3):  \n- Apple at (9,4) \u2192 need to go right and up.  \n- Apple at (7,7) \u2192 up and right.  \n- Apple at (2,9) \u2192 far left and up.  \n- Apples at (9,7), (9,6) \u2192 far right and up.  \n\nClosest apple by Manhattan distance:  \n(7,7): dist = |7-6|+|7-3| = 1+4=5  \n(9,4): dist = 3+1=4  \n(2,9): dist = 4+6=10  \n\nSo (9,4) is closest.  \n\nTo get to (9,4) from (6,3): need to go RIGHT (increase x) and UP (increase y).  \nSo RIGHT or UP moves help.  \n\nUP \u2192 (6,4) \u2192 then need to go right to (9,4).  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7,3) \u2192 then need to go up to (9,4).  \n\nBoth are equally good in steps, but UP gets me closer in y immediately, but also moves away from enemy head (enemy at (6,7) \u2192 going UP to (6,4) keeps me aligned vertically but farther).  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility:\nFrom (6,4): possible moves next turn: UP (6,5), LEFT (5,4), RIGHT (7,4), DOWN (6,3) (but (6,3) will be empty next turn since I moved). All likely safe unless enemy moves into them.  \nFrom (7,3): possible moves next turn: UP (7,4), LEFT (6,3), RIGHT (8,3), DOWN (7,2) (my old tail? Wait, my body will be at (6,3), (6,2), (7,2) if I move RIGHT? Let\u2019s trace: current body: head (6,3), then (6,2), (7,2). If I move RIGHT to (7,3), new body becomes: head (7,3), then (6,3), (6,2). Tail at (7,2) disappears (since no apple eaten). So (7,2) becomes empty. So from (7,3), DOWN to (7,2) is safe next turn.  \n\nBoth seem fine for mobility.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Danger from enemy:\nEnemy at (6,7) with length 4 vs my length 3. If we meet, I lose (head-on) or if I run into its body.  \nCurrently enemy could move toward apples at (7,7) or (9,7), so likely moving right/up.  \n\nIf I go UP to (6,4), enemy going UP to (6,8) \u2192 no conflict.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (7,3), enemy going RIGHT to (7,7) \u2192 no conflict.  \n\nBut going UP keeps me farther from enemy head.  \n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan:**  \nAim for apple (9,4) via UP then RIGHT moves, while avoiding moving toward enemy\u2019s area (top-right). Keep options open, don\u2019t box self in left side unless going for (2,9) later.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** UP gets me closer in y to closest apple (9,4) and is safe.  \n\nUP",

Length = 3 (2 apples eaten).  \nApples at: (9,7), (9,6), (9,4), (7,7), (2,9).\n\n**2. Enemy snake #1:**  \nHead at (4, 7). Body: [(5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6)]. Length = 4 (3 apples eaten).\n\n---\n\n**3. Possible moves from (7,4):**  \n- **UP** \u2192 (7,5) \u2013 empty? Board shows nothing at (7,5). Check collisions: not my body (body at (6,4), (6,3)), not enemy body (enemy body at (5,7),(6,7),(6,6)). Safe.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (7,3) \u2013 empty? Board shows nothing at (7,3). Check collisions: not my body, not enemy body. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (6,4) \u2013 This is my own body segment directly behind head. That\u2019s suicide (moving backwards into own body). **Not safe**.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8,4) \u2013 empty? Board shows nothing at (8,4). Check collisions: not my body, not enemy body. Safe.\n\nSo **LEFT** is out immediately.\n\n---\n\n**4. Enemy possible moves from (4,7):**  \nEnemy body: (5,7), (6,7), (6,6). Possible enemy moves:  \n- UP (4,8): empty, safe for them.  \n- DOWN (4,6): empty, safe.  \n- LEFT (3,7): empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT (5,7): that\u2019s into its own body segment (directly behind head), so they probably won\u2019t choose that unless suicidal. But they might.\n\n---\n\n**5. Head-on collision check:**  \nMy possible moves: UP (7,5), DOWN (7,3), RIGHT (8,4).  \nEnemy possible safe moves: UP (4,8), DOWN (4,6), LEFT (3,7).  \nNo overlap in coordinates, so no possible head-on collision this turn.\n\n---\n\n**6. Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (7,7) \u2013 distance from me: |7-7|+|4-7| = 3 steps.  \n- (9,4) \u2013 distance: |7-9|+|4-4| = 2 steps.  \n- (9,6) \u2013 distance: |7-9|+|4-6| = 4 steps.  \n- (9,7) \u2013 distance: 5 steps.  \n- (2,9) \u2013 far.\n\n---\n\n**7. Safe moves and future options:**  \n\n**UP (7,5)**: Then next turn possible moves from (7,5): UP (7,6), DOWN (7,4) (my old head now empty?), LEFT (6,5), RIGHT (8,5). All likely safe unless enemy moves into them next turn. Puts me closer to (7,7) and (9,6)/(9,7).  \n\n**DOWN (7,3)**: Next turn from (7,3): UP (7,4) (empty), DOWN (7,2), LEFT (6,3) (my tail at (6,3) will move away? Wait, snake moves: my tail at (6,3) will move only if I don\u2019t eat an apple. Currently length=3, so tail moves forward one cell each turn unless I eat apple. If I move DOWN to (7,3), my body becomes [(7,4), (6,4), (6,3)] \u2192 head at (7,3), body at (7,4),(6,4), tail at (6,3). Next turn tail moves to (6,4)? Actually let\u2019s track: current: head (7,4), body (6,4), tail (6,3). Move to (7,3): new head (7,3), add old head (7,4) as new segment[1], then (6,4) as segment[2], tail (6,3) drops off. So next turn body: [(7,3),(7,4),(6,4)]. So (6,3) empty next turn. So from (7,3) next turn, LEFT to (6,3) safe. Good options. Downside: away from most apples except maybe (9,4) is same y but far right.\n\n**RIGHT (8,4)**: Next turn from (8,4): UP (8,5), DOWN (8,3), LEFT (7,4) (empty), RIGHT (9,4) (apple!). That\u2019s good. But enemy might move into (9,4)? Unlikely this turn. But moving RIGHT now gets me closer to apple (9,4) in 1 step next turn.\n\n---\n\n**8. Which is best?**  \nRIGHT (8,4):  \n- Puts me one step from apple (9,4) next turn if I go RIGHT again.  \n- Keeps options open: from (8,4) next turn I can go UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT likely all safe.  \n- Avoids trapping myself.\n\nUP (7,5): also safe, but apple (9,4) is closer horizontally from (8,4) than from (7,5).  \nDOWN (7,3): moves away from most apples.\n\nSo **RIGHT** seems best for immediate apple access next turn while staying safe.\n\n---\n\n**9. Long-term plan note:**  \nApple at (9,4) is reachable next turn if I go RIGHT now. Be careful: enemy is far away at (4,7), so no head-on risk. After eating (9,4), consider going for (7,7) or (9,6) while avoiding dead ends near walls. Keep length advantage over enemy if possible.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Good.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (9,3):  \nNext turn possible moves: UP (9,4) [empty], DOWN (9,2) [empty], LEFT (8,3) [empty], RIGHT off board.  \nSo next turn from (9,3): safe moves LEFT, UP, DOWN.  \n\nBoth are safe now, but UP gets me closer to apples (9,6) and (9,7), which are reachable without immediate enemy threat. Enemy is far left side, going for (2,9) or (2,4) or (7,7).  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nUP now to (9,5), then next turn UP to (9,6) to eat apple, then either LEFT to (8,6) or DOWN to (9,5) depending on safety. This secures apple lead. Enemy likely heading toward (7,7) or (2,9) \u2014 not near me for now. Keep checking if enemy moves toward center/right later.\n\n---\n\nUP",

Eating apple grows me, tail stays same length for now.  \n- **DOWN**: (9,4) \u2014 my own body segment (currently my neck), would die instantly.  \n- **LEFT**: (8,5) \u2014 empty, safe.  \n- **RIGHT**: off board (10,5) \u2014 invalid, die.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy possible moves from (2,8):**  \nEnemy safe moves: UP (2,9) [apple], DOWN (2,7) [its own body? Wait, (2,7) is its body segment \u2014 yes, so not safe], LEFT (1,8) [empty], RIGHT (3,8) [empty]. Actually DOWN is unsafe because (2,7) is part of its body. So enemy safe: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nEnemy might go UP for apple at (2,9).  \n\n---\n\n**Risk of head-on collision:**  \nNo risk this turn \u2014 enemy is far away.  \n\n---\n\n**Future safety after each option:**  \n\n1. **UP to (9,6) and eat apple**:  \n   Next turn from (9,6): possible moves UP (9,7) [apple], DOWN (9,5) [empty after I move? Wait, my old head at (9,5) will be neck, so (9,5) will be my body after I move up. Yes, because after eating apple, body grows: new head at (9,6), neck at (9,5), then (9,4), (8,4), (7,4). So DOWN (9,5) would be my own body next turn \u2014 unsafe. LEFT (8,6) [empty], RIGHT off board. So next turn only safe: UP, LEFT.  \n   Eating apple gets me to 4 apples, leads enemy 3.  \n\n2. **LEFT to (8,5)**:  \n   Next turn from (8,5): possible moves UP (8,6) [empty], DOWN (8,4) [my body? Let\u2019s check: after moving left, body becomes [(8,5), (9,5), (9,4), (8,4), (7,4)? Wait, no \u2014 I haven\u2019t eaten apple, so length stays 4: head (8,5), neck (9,5), then (9,4), (8,4). Tail (7,4) disappears because length 4 means only 3 body segments after head? Let\u2019s recalc: I have 4 total segments now (head + 3 body). Moving without eating: new head (8,5), body becomes [(9,5), (9,4), (8,4)]. So (8,4) is tail. So DOWN (8,4) is my tail \u2014 safe because tail moves away when I move next? Actually on next turn, if I move from (8,5), tail is at (8,4) but will move when I move? Wait, tail only moves if I don\u2019t eat. But next turn\u2019s tail position depends on this turn\u2019s movement. Let\u2019s keep it simple: from (8,5) next turn, DOWN (8,4) is currently tail, but after this turn\u2019s movement, tail will be at (7,4)? Let\u2019s trace: current body: (9,4), (8,4), (7,4). Move head to (8,5), new body: (9,5), (9,4), (8,4). Tail (7,4) gone. So (8,4) is last segment. Next turn if I move from (8,5), tail at (8,4) will move to (9,4)? Actually no \u2014 tail moves when head moves without eating. So next turn if I move from (8,5), my body will be [(new head), (8,5), (9,5), (9,4)], tail (8,4) gone, new tail (9,4). So (8,4) is empty next turn. So DOWN (8,4) safe next turn. LEFT (7,5) safe, RIGHT (9,5) my body, UP (8,6) safe. So multiple options.  \n\nBut going LEFT delays eating apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nTake apple at (9,6) now with UP. Then next turn from (9,6), either go UP to (9,7) for another apple or LEFT to (8,6) to avoid trapping myself. Enemy likely going for (2,9) apple, so I can secure right-side apples quickly.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gets apple now, increases score lead, and is safe. LEFT is safe but misses immediate apple. Prefer UP.  \n\nUP",
