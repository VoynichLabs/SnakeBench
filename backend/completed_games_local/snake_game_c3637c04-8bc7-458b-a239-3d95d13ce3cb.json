Snake #0 head is at (5, 6).\n\n**Move Analysis for Snake #1 (Head: 6, 6):**\n- **UP**: (6, 7) - **Death** (moving backwards into my own body).\n- **DOWN**: (6, 5) - **Safe**. Moves towards apple at (7, 1) and (3, 4).\n- **LEFT**: (5, 6) - **Potential Death**. This coordinate currently contains the enemy head. If the enemy stays or moves into this cell (which it can't, but it could be a head-on collision if it moves elsewhere and I move there), it's risky. Most importantly, Snake #0 is currently *on* (5, 6), meaning the apple that was there is now gone (collected by Snake #0).\n- **RIGHT**: (7, 6) - **Safe**. Open space.\n\n**Enemy Analysis (Snake #0):**\n- Snake #0 head is at (5, 6). Its body is at (5, 5) and (5, 4).\n- Its possible moves are UP (5, 7), LEFT (4, 6), or RIGHT (6, 6). It cannot move DOWN to (5, 5).\n- If I move LEFT to (5, 6), and Snake #0 moves, I am moving into where its body was or where its head might still be. This is very dangerous.\n- If I move RIGHT to (7, 6), I stay away from Snake #0.\n- If I move DOWN to (6, 5), I move towards the apple at (7, 1).\n\n**Targeting Apples:**\n- (7, 1): 6 steps away from (6, 6).\n- (3, 4): 5 steps away from (6, 6).\n- (0, 4): 8 steps away.\n- (1, 0): 11 steps away.\n- (4, 9): 5 steps away, but requires passing the enemy.\n\nSnake #0 just ate the apple at (5, 6) (which is why its score is 2 and its head is there). Moving LEFT to (5, 6) is now both redundant (no apple) and dangerous (head-on collision risk or hitting its body).\n\nMoving DOWN to (6, 5) is the most efficient path toward the apples at (3, 4) and (7, 1) while maintaining distance from Snake #0's head.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAvoid the head of Snake #0. Move down to (6, 5) to positioning myself for the apples at (3, 4) or (7, 1). Priority is to safely gather apples and not get cut off by the enemy snake's longer body.\n\nDOWN",

However, moving LEFT to (5, 4) moves me directly into the same x-coordinate as the enemy's body trailing behind it, though it is currently 2 units above me.

From (0, 3), it is 1 move RIGHT and 3 moves DOWN, or 3 moves DOWN and 1 move RIGHT.\n- **Apple at (7, 1)**: Also in the lower half of the board.\n- **Enemy Snake #0**: Their head is at (5, 7).

Planning:**\nI will continue moving DOWN along the X=0 wall toward the apple at (1, 0). Once I reach Y=0 or Y=1, I will turn RIGHT to collect it. This keeps my body trailing along the edge, which is generally a safe defensive posture in the early game.\n\n**Plan:** Move DOWN towards the apple at (1, 0).\n\nDOWN",

Valid Move Analysis for Snake 1 (Head: 3, 2):**\n- **UP**: Moves to (3, 3). **Safe**. This lands directly on an apple. \n- **DOWN**: Moves to (3, 1). **Death** (Moves backwards into body).\n- **LEFT**: Moves to (2, 2). **Safe**.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to (4, 2). **Safe**.\n\n**2. Strategy and Pathing:**\n- **Apple (3, 3)**: Only 1 move away (UP). This is the highest priority move because it gains a point immediately and is completely safe from the enemy snake (which is far away at (7, 9)).\n- **Apple (7, 1)**: Reachable after taking (3, 3) by moving right and down.\n- **Snake 0**: Currently at (7, 9) and moving within a cluster of apples in the top right. It is not currently a threat to my position at (3, 2).\n\n**3. Move Comparison:**\n- **UP**: Reaches apple at (3, 3). This increases my score to 6 and grows my length.\n- **LEFT / RIGHT**: Do not provide immediate points and do not put me in a significantly better position than moving to (3, 3) would.\n\n**4. Future Planning:**\nAfter moving UP to (3, 3) to collect the apple, my head will be at (3, 3). From there, I will likely look towards the apple at (7, 1) or evaluate if I can contest the apples at (6, 8) or (7, 8) depending on how Snake 0 maneuvers in that corner. My priority is to keep pace with Snake 0's score.\n\nUP",

(Note: My tail was at (5, 5) last turn, but as the snake moves, the tail segment at (6, 5) moves to (5, 5) and the old (5, 5) clears. *Correction*: Looking at the body list [(6,6), (7,6), (8,6), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (7,5), (6,5)], the tail is currently at (6, 5). Therefore, (5, 5) is completely empty and safe.)\n    *   **LEFT**: Moves to (4, 6). Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT**: Moves to (6, 6). **Death** (Backwards move into own body).\n\n2.  **Obstacle and Apple Analysis:**\n    *   Your head is at (5, 6). Your body is a horizontal barrier to your right: (6,6) to (9,6) and then (9,5) to (6,5).\n    *   Snake #0 (Head: 4, 2) is currently below you. Its body creates a vertical wall along the x=2 and x=3/4/5 lines at the top. Specifically, there is a segment at (5, 8).\n    *   Apples: (7, 1), (0, 2), (9, 2), (1, 8), (4, 0).\n\n3.  **Strategy Selection:**\n    *   **DOWN** to (5, 5): This is restricted. Moving to (5, 5) puts you between two rows of your own body (y=6 and y=5). While the tail is moving out of (6, 5) this turn, it's a tight space.\n    *   **UP** to (5, 7): This is a good move. It keeps the center open.\n    *   **LEFT** to (4, 6): This is also a strong move. It moves you toward the center-left and away from your own body.\n\n4.  **Comparison and Risks:**\n    *   Snake 0 is at (4, 2). If I move **LEFT** to (4, 6), I stay on a different column than Snake 0's path for now.\n    *   The apple at (4, 0) is well-guarded by Snake 0.\n    *   The apple at (1, 8) is reachable if I go UP then LEFT, though Snake 0's tail is near there (5, 8).\n    *   The move **LEFT** to (4, 6) offers the most flexibility to react to Snake 0 and choose between going for (0, 2) or (1, 8) later.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (4, 6) to gain control of the center. From there, evaluate if Snake 0 moves towards (0, 2) or (4, 0). If Snake 0 stays low, I can loop around to (1, 8). If Snake 0 moves up, I will dive for the bottom apples once my tail clears columns 6-9.\n\nLEFT",

Its body forms a long vertical and horizontal barrier on the left side: (4,2)-(3,2)-(2,2)-(2,8)-(4,8).\n    *   Apples: (7, 1), (0, 2), (9, 2), (1, 8), (4, 0).\n    *   Snake #0 is very close to apples (4, 0) and (7, 1).\n\n3.  **Strategy Selection:**\n    *   Moving **UP** to (4, 7): This gets you closer to the apple at (1, 8) while staying in the \"center-top\" area. It keeps you away from Snake #0's head for now.\n    *   Moving **DOWN** to (4, 5): This moves you toward the center, but puts you closer to Snake #0. Note that Snake #0's head is at (4, 1). If both move toward each other, a collision could happen in 2 turns.\n    *   Moving **LEFT** to (3, 6): This puts you in the narrow corridor between your head and Snake #0's body at X=2.\n\n4.  **Risk Assessment:**\n    *   Snake #0 is at (4, 1). It is likely to go for apple (4, 0) or (7, 1).\n    *   Going **UP** is the safest way to maintain space and prepare to loop around Snake #0's tail at (4, 8) or wait for your own tail (currently at 7, 5) to clear the right side of the board.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to (4, 7) to avoid the narrowing space between Snake #0's body and my own. This positions me to either contest the apple at (1, 8) or sweep across the top once my tail clears the right side (Rows 5 and 6).

While safe for one turn, it limits your mobility.\n\n4.  **Risk Assessment:**\n    *   Moving RIGHT is safe and maintains maximum distance from all hazards.\n    *   Note that your tail is at (8, 5). As you move, your tail will vacate (8, 5), (9, 5), etc., eventually opening up the right side of the board.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (5, 7). Avoid the narrow corridor on the left.

It is moving along the bottom and poses no immediate threat.\n\n3.  **Strategy Selection:**\n    *   **RIGHT** to (6, 7): This is a strong move. It keeps you away from Snake #0's head/body and allows you to circle around your own tail as it moves. Your tail is currently at (9, 5). In 4 turns, the path at X=9 will be clear.\n    *   **UP** to (5, 8): This puts you closer to the top wall and closer to Snake #0's body at (4, 8)/ (3, 8). It's safe but slightly more restrictive.\n\n4.  **Risk Assessment:**\n    *   Moving RIGHT is the safest path to maintain mobility. It positions you to eventually wrap around the right side of the board once your tail clears (9, 6) and (9, 5).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove RIGHT and then likely continue RIGHT toward the wall (X=9). By the time you reach the right wall, your tail at (9, 6) and (9, 5) will have moved forward, allowing you to move DOWN along the right edge to target the apples at (9, 2) and (7, 1). This avoids the congested center and the proximity to Snake #0's body.\n\nRIGHT",

If you move RIGHT to (9, 7) and then eventually DOWN the 9-column, you need to be careful of Snake #0's head.

This is your neck/body position.\n    *   **DOWN**: Moves to (9, 4). **Safe**. This follows the edge towards the apple at (9, 2).\n    *   **LEFT**: Moves to (8, 5). **Safe**. Moves towards the center.\n    *   **RIGHT**: Moves to (10, 5). **Death**. Off the board.\n\n2.  **Obstacle and Apple Analysis:**\n    *   **Your Body**: You are currently in a vertical line along the 9-column and a horizontal line along the 7-row. Moving DOWN keeps you clear of your own tail which is moving away from the (4, 6) area.\n    *   **Snake #0**: Head is at (6, 3). Body occupies space in the lower middle. It is currently somewhat trapped by its own body or moving towards apples in the center/bottom.\n    *   **Apples**:\n        *   (9, 2): Directly below you. Distance = 3 moves.\n        *   (5, 4): To your left. Distance = 4 + 1 = 5 moves.\n        *   (5, 1): Below and left. Distance = 4 + 4 = 8 moves.\n\n3.  **Strategy Selection:**\n    *   **DOWN** is the most efficient move. It targets the apple at (9, 2). Since Snake #0's head is at (6, 3), it is also 3 moves away from (9, 2). However, Snake #0 is currently facing towards its own tail/body and is closer to the apple at (5, 4) or (5, 1).\n    *   Moving DOWN maintains your distance from Snake #0 while staying on the periphery, which is safer for navigation.\n\n4.  **Risk Assessment:**\n    *   The primary risk is a potential head-on collision at (9, 2) in three turns if Snake #0 moves RIGHT-RIGHT-DOWN. I will monitor Snake #0's movement; if it moves towards the right edge, I may need to intercept or divert.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nContinue moving DOWN the 9-column to collect the apple at (9, 2). After collecting (9, 2), shift LEFT along the bottom edge or move towards the apple at (5, 1) or (0, 2) depending on the board state and Snake #0's position.\n\nDOWN",

On the next turn, I can reach (9, 2).\n    *   Snake #0 is unlikely to reach (9, 2) before me because its body segments at (7, 3), (7, 2), and (7, 1) create a wall it must navigate around.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove DOWN to collect the apple at (9, 2).

It is the most efficient path to increasing your score and doesn't put you in immediate danger.\n    *   After moving to (9, 2), you will be at the bottom-right corner area. You will need to turn LEFT to navigate towards the other apples, but you must be careful not to get pinned against the bottom wall by Snake #0's body.\n\n4.  **Risk Assessment:**\n    *   Snake #0 cannot reach (9, 2) this turn.\n    *   The only risk of moving DOWN is that you move closer to the corner, but since your tail is moving out of the way at (5, 7), you will have plenty of space to loop back toward the center or along the top.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove DOWN to collect (9, 2). Next, evaluate the position of Snake #0. It is likely to go for (5, 3) or (5, 1). After (9, 2) is collected, I will likely move LEFT along the row Y=2 or Y=1 to approach (5, 1) or (0, 2), depending on where Snake #0 positions itself.\n\nDOWN",

Your head is at (9, 2). Your tail is at (5, 7).\n    *   **Snake #0**: Head is at (5, 3). It is moving through the center. Its body is fairly long and clustered in the middle-bottom.\n    *   **Closest Apple**: (5, 1) is 5 moves away (Left 4, Down 1). (0, 2) is 9 moves away (Left 9).\n\n3.  **Pathfinding & Hazards:**\n    *   If I move **DOWN** to (9, 1), I hug the wall. From (9, 1), I can move LEFT towards (5, 1).\n    *   If I move **LEFT** to (8, 2), I am moving directly toward Snake #0's body.

If Snake #0 takes (5, 1), pivot toward (0, 2) or the upper apples. Maintain flexibility as my long tail clears the column 9 area.\n\nLEFT",

This cell is occupied by Snake #0's body.\n    *   **RIGHT**: Moves to (9, 2). **Death**. This is your previous head/neck position.\n\n2.  **Apples and Snake Analysis:**\n    *   **Apples**: (0, 2), (1, 8), (5, 1), (4, 6), (5, 9).\n    *   **Snake #0 (Head: 5, 2)**: It is just to your left. Its body forms a messy block in the middle. It is very likely to move towards apple (5, 1) by moving DOWN or LEFT. \n    *   **Your Position**: Your head (8, 2) is blocked to the left by Snake #0. Your own body (9, 2 to 9, 7 to 6, 7) is wrapped around the right and top-right.\n\n3.  **Pathfinding & Hazards:**\n    *   Moving **DOWN** to (8, 1) is the most logical step to reach apple (5, 1) or (0, 2). From (8, 1), I can continue LEFT to (7, 1) then (6, 1) once Snake #0's body moves or if there's an opening.\n    *   Looking at (8, 1):\n        *   Snake #0's body at (7, 1) is currently there. However, segments move with the snake. The segment at (7, 1) will move to (7, 2) or wherever the snake flows next turn. Actually, (7, 1) is the 7th segment of Snake #0. It *will* move this turn.\n        *   Wait, Snake #0's body: (5, 2) head, (5, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (7, 1)... The segment at (7, 1) will be occupied by the segment currently at (7, 2) next turn. So **LEFT** is definitely death, and **DOWN** leads to (8, 1) which is currently empty.\n    *   Moving **UP** to (8, 3) puts me in a narrow corridor between my tail at (8, 7) and Snake 0's body at (7, 3). This seems more restrictive.\n\n4.  **Strategy Selection:**\n    *   **DOWN** is the best move. It keeps me away from the wall and prepares a path to the bottom apples (5, 1) and (0, 2). Since Snake #0 is currently occupying (7, 1) and (7, 2), I need to wait for its tail/body to cycle through or move away before I can cross to the left side of the board.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (8, 1), then evaluate if I can squeeze LEFT towards (5, 1). If Snake #0 blocks the lower path, I may have to circle around its tail or wait for my own long body to clear the right wall.\n\nDOWN",

This is where I just came from.\n    *   **DOWN**: Moves to (8, 0). **Safe**.\n    *   **LEFT**: Moves to (7, 1). **Death**. Snake #0's body segment is currently at (7, 1) and its head is at (5, 1). Based on the body list, (7, 1) is the 8th segment. Even if it moves, the segment at (7, 2) moves into (7, 1).\n    *   **RIGHT**: Moves to (9, 1). **Safe**.\n\n2.  **Apples and Snake Analysis:**\n    *   **Apples**: (0, 2), (1, 8), (4, 6), (5, 9), (3, 3). Note: Apple (5, 1) was eaten by Snake #0 last turn.\n    *   **Snake #0 (Head: 5, 1)**: It just ate an apple and grew. Its body is dense in the middle-left. It is currently moving down/right.\n    *   **Your Position**: My head is at (8, 1). My body occupies (8, 2) and then wraps around the right edge (9, 2) up to (9, 7) and then (7, 7).\n\n3.  **Pathfinding & Hazards:**\n    *   **LEFT** is blocked by the wall of Snake #0's body at X=7.\n    *   **RIGHT** to (9, 1) puts me against the wall and potentially traps me if I can't turn back, but (9, 0) and (8, 0) are currently open.\n    *   **DOWN** to (8, 0) is safe and keeps me along the bottom edge.\n    *   **UP** to (8, 2) is safe but puts me back where I was, which was a bit cramped.\n\n4.  **Strategy Selection:**\n    *   I am currently \"chasing\" the tail of Snake #0. I need to wait for its body to clear from the X=7 and X=6 columns so I can reach the apples on the left side (0, 2) and (3, 3).\n    *   Moving **DOWN** to (8, 0) allows me to then move **LEFT** along the bottom wall (X, 0) once Snake #0 moves its tail out of the way (it currently has segments at (6, 0), (5, 0), (4, 0)).\n    *   Snake #0's head is at (5, 1). If it moves DOWN to (5, 0), it might block my path along the bottom. However, it is more likely to turn towards (3, 3) or (0, 2).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove to the bottom edge (8, 0) and wait for an opening in Snake #0's body to cross to the left side of the board. The goal is to reach (3, 3) or (0, 2) while staying clear of Snake #0's head.\n\nDOWN",
