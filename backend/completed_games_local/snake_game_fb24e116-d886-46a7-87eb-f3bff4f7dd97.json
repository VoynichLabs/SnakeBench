The board is TIGHT, 10x10, and we are looking for that early advantage, you feel me?\n\nTurn 0! It's all about positioning right now. We need to secure the first apple and start building that body so we can start boxing in the opponent! The goal is to make Snake #0 crash out! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 0):**\nMy Head: (2, 6). Length 1.\nRival Head (0): (3, 3). Length 1.\nClosest Apples: (1, 7) [UP/LEFT], (3, 6) [RIGHT], (1, 5) [DOWN/LEFT], (2, 6) is where I am.\n\nThe most immediate apples are (1, 7) and (3, 6).\n\n**Feasibility Check (ID 1, Head (2, 6)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (2, 7):** Safe. Gets me closer to (1, 7) and keeps me central.\n2.  **DOWN to (2, 5):** Safe. Gets me closer to (1, 5).\n3.  **LEFT to (1, 6):** Safe. Puts me adjacent to (1, 7). Very strong contender.\n4.  **RIGHT to (3, 6):** **APPLE!** (3, 6) is an apple location. This is a guaranteed score, Chat!\n\nThis is a no-brainer! If I can grab an apple on Turn 1, that's massive momentum.\n\n**Opponent's Potential Moves (Snake #0, Head (3, 3)):**\n\nSnake #0 is at (3, 3). They have several nearby apples: (7, 3) [RIGHT], (8, 3) [FAR RIGHT], (5, 0) [DOWN/RIGHT], (0, 2) [LEFT/DOWN]. The closest one is technically (7, 3), but that's 4 units away. They are more likely going for:\n*   (5, 0) - DOWN/RIGHT\n*   (0, 2) - LEFT/DOWN\n\nLet's assume the rival wants to score too.\n*   If they move **UP** to (3, 4): They are heading towards the center.\n*   If they move **DOWN** to (3, 2): They are heading away from most action, maybe towards (5, 0) diagonally.\n*   If they move **LEFT** to (2, 3): They are crossing the board towards (0, 2).\n*   If they move **RIGHT** to (4, 3): They are heading towards the main cluster.\n\nSince they are far away, there is no immediate collision risk on Turn 1, regardless of my move.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nMoving RIGHT to (3, 6) gets me an apple immediately. I become length 2, and I get point #1! This secures the high ground in the center-right part of the board, which is packed with apples (A at (5, 6), A at (7, 4), A at (8, 5)).\n\nThis is the aggressive, point-scoring start we need, Chat! Securing the bag early! \ud83d\udcb0\n\n**Long Term Plan Note:**\nGrab (3, 6) this turn. Next, look to consolidate the central apples (5, 6), (7, 4), and the ones above (8, 5) and (9, 8). Keep an eye on Snake #0's path; we want to build a long body quickly to cut them off if they try to come up the middle.\n\nRIGHT",

Let\u2019s eliminate deadly moves first:\n- UP to (3,4): Is that off the board? Nope (0-9 for x/y)! Any snake bodies? Nada (our body\u2019s empty, rival\u2019s body\u2019s empty)! SAFE \ud83d\udfe2\n- DOWN to (3,2): Same vibe\u2014valid coordinate, no bodies to hit! SAFE \ud83d\udfe2\n- LEFT to (2,3): No off-board, no body collisions! SAFE \ud83d\udfe2\n- RIGHT to (4,3): Zero red flags\u2014valid, no bodies! SAFE \ud83d\udfe2\nWait, all four moves are safe?! That\u2019s a flex, but we gotta pick the one that\u2019s a ruthless apple-hunting, trap-avoiding bop\u2014you feel me?!\n\nNow, let\u2019s rank the safe moves by the rules: apples first, open future options second, avoid rival chaos third!\n- LEFT to (2,3): Why get closer to the rival\u2019s head at (2,6)? That\u2019s asking for future head-on collisions, right? Why play defense when we can play offense with apples?! \ud83d\udeab\n- DOWN to (3,2): Only towards the (0,2) apple\u2014farther, and the lower y-levels have fewer open paths (look at y=0 only has one apple)! Tightens our options later\u2014no thanks \ud83d\udeab\n- UP to (3,4): Towards the (3,6) apple, but that\u2019s a vertical climb with less horizontal wiggle room\u2014why limit ourselves when we have a horizontal buffet?! \ud83d\udeab\n- RIGHT to (4,3): Oh, this is the chef\u2019s kiss move! Let\u2019s break it:\n  1. Apples galore: It\u2019s a straight shot to the (7,3) and (8,3) apples (two whole apples in a row on y=3\u2014hello, easy content! \ud83e\udd24)\n  2. Open future moves: If we land at (4,3) next turn, we still have zero body\u2014so all four directions stay safe (no trapped corners here!); we can pivot up/down if the rival tries to box us in later\n  3. Rival proof: The rival\u2019s at (2,6)\u2014their possible moves (up/down/left/right) won\u2019t land on (4,3) (they\u2019re too far up to reach our horizontal path this turn)! No head-on collision risk here\u2014score!\n\nLong-term plan for future me (don\u2019t forget this, fam!):\n1. Next 2 turns: Keep sliding right towards (7,3) apple\u2014lock in that horizontal path (y=3 is wide open with no obstacles!)\n2. Watch rival\u2019s moves: If they start heading down towards our y=3 path, pivot up to (4,4) or down to (4,2) to keep our apple access while dodging their chaos\n3. Prioritize (7,3) first, then (8,3)\u2014two quick points to pull ahead before the rival even finds their first apple!\n\nChat, this is a no-brainer! Why settle for less when we can go for a straight apple feast with endless future options? Isn\u2019t that how we box the rival in later\u2014by getting points first and controlling the open board? Isn\u2019t that the ruthless energy we came to stream with?!\n\nRIGHT",

We are now length 2, and locked in at (3, 6) with our little tail at (2, 6). Score 1-0! L E T' S G O! \ud83c\udf89\n\nNow, we need to solidify this advantage. Our goal is still to box in Snake #0! The rival is currently at (4, 3) and is still length 1. They are far to the south, and we have the high ground and control over the most dense apple region.\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 1):**\nMy Head: (3, 6). Body: [(2, 6)].\nRival Head (0): (4, 3). Body: none.\n\nWe are looking for the next piece of content!\nClosest apples to ID 1 (3, 6):\n1. (5, 6) - 2 units RIGHT. EZ reach in two turns.\n2. (1, 7) - 3 units UP/LEFT.\n3. (7, 4) - 4 units DOWN/RIGHT.\n\nThe apple at (5, 6) is absolutely calling our name. It's a quick score, and it extends our influence eastward, which is a key maneuvering area.\n\n**Feasibility Check (ID 1, Head (3, 6)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (3, 7):** Safe. Moves towards (1, 7).\n2.  **DOWN to (3, 5):** Safe. This is a very central move. Keeps options open.\n3.  **LEFT to (2, 6):** **DANGER!** This is our body! Instant KO! NOT SAFE! \ud83d\udeab\n4.  **RIGHT to (4, 6):** Safe. One step closer to (5, 6). This is the immediate target.\n\nSo, we have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. We are prioritizing immediate content and positioning. Moving RIGHT sets us up perfectly for the next apple at (5, 6).\n\n**Opponent's Potential Moves (Snake #0, Head (4, 3)):**\n\nSnake #0 is at (4, 3). They are looking to score too.\nClosest apples for Snake #0:\n*   (7, 3) - 3 units RIGHT.\n*   (5, 0) - 3 units DOWN/RIGHT.\n\nThey are likely aiming RIGHT or DOWN/RIGHT.\n*   If they move UP to (4, 4): They are heading towards the center. This is the most dangerous move for us as it closes the distance quickly, but we are still far apart. (4, 4) is an apple! They will likely move UP for that grab!\n*   If they move DOWN to (4, 2): Headed towards (5, 0).\n*   If they move LEFT to (3, 3): Headed towards (0, 2).\n*   If they move RIGHT to (5, 3): Headed towards (7, 3) or (5, 0).\n\n**Crucial Insight: There is an apple at (4, 4). Snake #0 will almost certainly move UP to grab it and score 1 point.**\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (4, 4), and we move RIGHT to (4, 6), there is still a buffer of two squares between us: (4, 5) and (4, 4). No immediate danger!\n\n**Impact of ID 1 Moving RIGHT to (4, 6):**\nThis move positions us for the next apple (5, 6). It extends our body horizontally, starting the process of walling off the center of the board from the north. This is exactly what we need for the box-in strategy!\n\n**Impact of ID 1 Moving DOWN to (3, 5):**\nThis is a standard center move, but it delays the apple grab and puts us on a trajectory that eventually crosses the path of Snake #0 if they move UP.\n\n**Impact of ID 1 Moving UP to (3, 7):**\nGood for reaching (1, 7) and (8, 9), but we abandon the faster apple at (5, 6).\n\nThe path of least resistance *and* maximum reward is moving RIGHT. We want to chain these scores together, Chat! Get that length up!\n\n**Collision Check:**\nMy next position: (4, 6).\nRival's most likely position (aiming for (4, 4) apple): (4, 4).\nNo collision risk. We are safe and scoring next turn guaranteed!\n\n**Long Term Plan Note:**\nMove RIGHT now to (4, 6). Next turn, move RIGHT again to grab the apple at (5, 6). We will then be length 3, extending our body to (3, 6) -> (4, 6) -> (5, 6). This horizontal barrier will force Snake #0 to deal with us if they try to come north, giving us the perfect opportunity to cut them off and create a trap! Let's get these two apples fast!\n\nRIGHT",

We executed the plan perfectly\u2014move RIGHT\u2014and now look at the board state!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 2):**\nMy Head (ID 1): (4, 6). Body: [(3, 6)]. Length 2. Score: 1.\nRival Head (0): (5, 3). Body: none. Length 1. Score: 0.\n\nWait a second, Chat! Let's check the VOD review from the board state!\n\nLast turn, I was at (3, 6) and predicted Snake #0 would move UP from (4, 3) to grab the apple at (4, 4).\nHowever, the current board state shows Snake #0 is at **(5, 3)**.\n\n*Wait!* This means Snake #0 moved RIGHT from (4, 3) to (5, 3). They must be prioritizing the apples at (7, 3) or trying to get to (5, 0). They ignored the immediate apple at (4, 4)! **That's a huge misplay by the rival!** Are they throwing already, Chat?! We have a chance to capitalize!\n\nThe apple at (4, 4) is now ripe for the taking, but our immediate, high-value target is still the apple at **(5, 6)**. We planned this!\n\n**Goal:** Secure the (5, 6) apple immediately, reaching length 3. Then, evaluate the defensive position. We are trying to build that horizontal wall across the top center to box them in!\n\n**Feasibility Check (ID 1, Head (4, 6)):**\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 7):** Safe. Moves us further north, potentially towards the (1, 7) or (8, 9) apples.\n2.  **DOWN to (4, 5):** Safe. Moves us closer to the center, but away from the target (5, 6).\n3.  **LEFT to (3, 6):** **DANGER!** This is our body! Instant KO! NOT SAFE! \ud83d\udeab\n4.  **RIGHT to (5, 6):** **IT'S THE APPLE!** Safe. Instant score and body growth! Maximum value! LET'S GO FOR THE CONTENT!\n\nWe have three safe moves, but moving RIGHT is a guaranteed apple and continued momentum.\n\n**Opponent's Potential Moves (Snake #0, Head (5, 3)):**\n\nSnake #0 is at (5, 3). They are looking to score.\nClosest apples for Snake #0:\n*   (7, 3) - 2 units RIGHT.\n*   (5, 0) - 3 units DOWN.\n\nPossible moves for Snake #0:\n*   **UP to (5, 4):** Headed towards the center, blocking my potential DOWN moves later.\n*   **DOWN to (5, 2):** Headed towards (5, 0) apple. This is very likely for a score.\n*   **LEFT to (4, 3):** Moves back to where they were, or possibly towards the (4, 4) apple? Unlikely, unless they realized their mistake.\n*   **RIGHT to (6, 3):** Headed towards the (7, 3) apple. This is also very likely for a score.\n\nThe rival is going to try to score this turn. Either RIGHT to (6, 3) for the (7, 3) apple in 2 turns, or DOWN to (5, 2) for the (5, 0) apple in 3 turns.\n\n**Collision Check:**\nMy next position: (5, 6) (Apple).\nRival's next position: (5, 4), (5, 2), (4, 3), or (6, 3).\nThere is zero overlap or collision risk this turn. We are safe to move RIGHT and grab that apple!\n\n**Strategic Outlook (Long Term Box-In Plan):**\n\n1.  **Current Turn (T2):** Move RIGHT to (5, 6). We score again! Length 3. Our body is now [(4, 6), (3, 6)]. We control 3 cells horizontally.\n2.  **Next Turn (T3):** We will be at (5, 6). We need to determine the best path.\n    *   If Snake #0 moved to (5, 4), they are trying to come up. We could move DOWN to (5, 5) to block them early, or push further RIGHT towards (7, 4).\n    *   The apple at (7, 4) is 3 steps away from (5, 6). The apple at (7, 3) is 4 steps away.\n    *   If we manage to get (7, 4) next, we will have a massive central presence.\n\nThis quick, consecutive apple grab gives us the length advantage we need to start building our chokehold. We are looking good, Chat! We are keeping the pressure up and ensuring we have maximum safe space for maneuvering. Let's get this $2^{nd}$ apple!\n\nRIGHT",

The rival is nowhere yet!\n\nLet's look at the current board state BEFORE we make a move. We are live!\n\n**Current State Analysis (Turn 3):**\n\nMy Snake (ID 1):\n*   Head: (5, 6)\n*   Body: [(4, 6), (3, 6)]\n*   Length: 3\n\nRival Snake (ID 0):\n*   Head: (6, 3)\n*   Body: none\n*   Length: 1\n\nOkay, let's analyze where the rival went. Last turn, Snake #0 was at (5, 3). They moved **RIGHT** to (6, 3). This confirms they are prioritizing the **(7, 3)** apple, which is now just one step away from them! They are going for a score this turn. We cannot stop them from scoring this one, but we must use this time to solidify our lead and defensive position.\n\n**Goal:** Secure the next apple safely. We need to maintain our lead and turn this length advantage into a territorial nightmare for Snake #0.\n\n**Closest Apples for ID 1 (Head (5, 6)):**\n1.  (7, 4): 3 moves (R, D, R or R, R, D)\n2.  (1, 5): 5 moves (L, L, L, D, D, or L, L, D, D, L)\n3.  (7, 3): 4 moves (But Snake #0 is taking this!)\n\nThe **(7, 4)** apple is our immediate, high-probability target. Let's start moving towards it!\n\n### Feasibility Check (ID 1, Head (5, 6)):\n\n1.  **UP to (5, 7):** Safe. Keeps us centralized, but slightly away from the (7, 4) target. Opens path to (8, 9).\n2.  **DOWN to (5, 5):** Safe. Moves us closer to the center line. Potentially positions us to begin blocking Snake #0 if they try to move UP aggressively after scoring.\n3.  **LEFT to (4, 6):** **DANGER!** This is our body! Instant KO! We ain't throwing content that cheap! \ud83d\udeab\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 6):** Safe. Directly towards the (7, 4) apple. This looks like the best move for progression and control!\n\nWe have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n### Opponent's Potential Moves (Snake #0, Head (6, 3)):\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 3) and looking for the (7, 3) apple. It's a guaranteed score for them this turn.\n*   **UP to (6, 4):** Safe. Moves them towards the center.\n*   **DOWN to (6, 2):** Safe. Moves them towards the (5, 0) apple.\n*   **LEFT to (5, 3):** Safe (but dumb, moving away from apple).\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 3):** **IT'S THE APPLE!** GUARANTEED SCORE AND GROWTH! This is 99% their move. Length 2.\n\n**Collision Check (T3):**\n\nMy next position options (5, 7), (5, 5), or (6, 6).\nRival's most likely position: (7, 3).\n\nNo immediate head-to-head collision risk. We are safe to move aggressively towards our next objective.\n\n### Strategic Decision: RIGHT to (6, 6)\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 6) puts us one step closer to the (7, 4) apple, maintaining pressure on the right side of the board. This also expands our territorial claim horizontally, which is key to boxing them in later.\n\nIf we move RIGHT, our body will be [(5, 6), (4, 6)]. We are building a nice horizontal barrier.\n\n**What if we move DOWN to (5, 5)?** This is tempting if we want to immediately challenge their upcoming moves after they score. If they score at (7, 3), their next head will be (7, 3) and body (6, 3).\n*   From (5, 5), we could move RIGHT-DOWN-RIGHT to (7, 4).\n*   The path RIGHT-RIGHT-DOWN to (7, 4) from (5, 6) seems slightly cleaner:\n    *   T3: (6, 6) (Move RIGHT)\n    *   T4: (7, 6) or (6, 5) (Move towards T4)\n\nLet's go RIGHT! We need to maintain the scoring momentum and extend our control. We are ahead in length and we need to push that advantage! The goal is to build a wall above them before they get too long to manage!\n\n### Long-Term Plan (Chat, focus up!):\n\n1.  **T3 (Current):** Move **RIGHT** to (6, 6). Get closer to (7, 4). Snake #0 scores (7, 3). (Me: L3, Them: L2)\n2.  **T4:** From (6, 6), move towards (7, 4). Probably DOWN to (6, 5) or RIGHT to (7, 6). We need to see what Snake #0 does after scoring. If they move UP to (7, 4), they steal our apple! Highly unlikely as they would have to move RIGHT from (7, 3) to (8, 3) and then DOWN, or UP to (7, 4), but (7, 4) is usually 1-2 moves away if we are focused.\n    *   If Snake #0 goes LEFT to (6, 3) or DOWN to (7, 2) from (7, 3), we are safe to move in.\n    *   If we move **RIGHT** to (7, 6) from (6, 6), we get closer to (8, 9) or pivot down.\n3.  **T5/T6:** Secure the (7, 4) apple. Then, look to lock down the center or push to the corner (8, 9).\n\nLet's maintain the aggressive stance and grab that RIGHT movement! EZ CLAP! We're making history, Chat!\n\nRIGHT",

Rival (Snake #1) at (5,6) with body [(4,6), (3,6)] and 2 apples. Let\u2019s eliminate deadly moves first\u2014no exceptions:\n- UP (6,4): Valid coords (6x,4y 0-9), no snake bodies (our empty, rival\u2019s up high), no self-collision (no body to hit). SAFE \ud83d\udfe2\n- DOWN (6,2): Valid coords, no snake bodies, no self-collision. SAFE \ud83d\udfe2\n- LEFT (5,3): Valid coords, no snake bodies (we have none), no self-collision. SAFE \ud83d\udfe2\n- RIGHT (7,3): Valid coords, no snake bodies, no self-collision\u2014PLUS IT\u2019S AN APPLE (7,3 is on the drop list)! SAFE \ud83d\udfe2\n\nWait, all four safe? That\u2019s a flex, but we gotta pick the move that\u2019s an apple-hunting, trap-avoiding BOP\u2014you feel me?! Let\u2019s rank \u2018em with our non-negotiables (apples first, open future moves, avoid rival chaos):\n- LEFT (5,3): Backtracking to where we were last turn! That\u2019s giving up momentum toward the y=3 apple feast (7,3 and 8,3 are still waiting). Why stall when we can grab points? This closes our horizontal push\u2014hard no \ud83d\udeab\n- DOWN (6,2): Only toward the far-left (0,2) apple\u2014way fewer apples down there, low y-levels have tighter corridors (we called this last turn!). This limits pivot options later\u2014we don\u2019t wanna get trapped low when the rival might dive down. Hard pass \ud83d\udeab\n- UP (6,4): There\u2019s a (4,4) apple nearby, but that\u2019s one apple vs. the two on y=3 (7,3 and 8,3). Going up breaks our horizontal path, narrowing future moves more than staying on y=3. Why settle for one when we can lock in two? Not the move \ud83d\udeab\n- RIGHT (7,3): THIS IS THE CHEF\u2019S KISS MOVE, CHAT! Let\u2019s break it hard:\n  1. Apple alert: Grab (7,3) immediately\u2014+1 point, grow a body segment (hello, building our presence to box the rival in later!)\n  2. Open future moves: Landing at (7,3) (new body at (6,3)) means next turn we can still pivot up/down/right (left is our body, but three safe moves left\u2014no trapped corners!)\n  3. Rival proof: The rival\u2019s head is (5,6)\u2014their possible moves land them in (4-6 x,5-7 y) this turn\u2014way too far from (7,3) to collide. No head-on chaos here!\n\nLong-term plan for future me (don\u2019t sleep on this):\n1. Next turn: Keep sliding right to (8,3) to grab the second y=3 apple\u2014tie the rival\u2019s 2 apples immediately!\n2. Watch rival\u2019s moves: If they start heading down toward y=3, pivot up from (8,3) to (8,4) to avoid their body\n3. Once we have both y=3 apples, use our growing body to control the horizontal y=3 corridor\u2014block the rival\u2019s path if they try to cut through\n4. Avoid low y-levels (y<3) and backtracking\u2014momentum is key to crushing their game plan\n\nChat\u2014isn\u2019t this how we take the lead? Grabbing quick apples to catch up, then using our growing body to box the rival in? Isn\u2019t that the ruthless energy we came to stream with? Is there any reason to pick another direction that sells us short? Nah\u2014left is backtracking, down is trapping, up is settling for one apple\u2014right is the only move that checks all boxes!\n\nLong-term strategy note (for next turn\u2019s rationale):\n1. After grabbing (7,3) this turn, our body will be [(6,3)] (head at (7,3))\n2. Next turn\u2019s priority is (8,3) apple\u2014right move is still the bop, but check if rival\u2019s moved down toward y=3 first\n3. Keep pivoting options open (up from (8,3) to (8,4) if rival approaches)\n4. Avoid left (our body at (6,3) then (7,3) after next apple)\n\nRIGHT",

We called it! We predicted the play!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 4):\n\n**My Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (6, 6)\n*   Body: [(5, 6), (4, 6)]\n*   Length: 3\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (7, 3)\n*   Body: [(6, 3)]\n*   Length: 2\n\n**Board State:**\nThe rival is now L2 at (7, 3) and is pushing up the right side. We are L3 at (6, 6), just above them. We have a LENGTH ADVANTAGE! We gotta use this!\n\n**Closest/Key Apples to ID 1 ((6, 6)):**\n1.  **(7, 4):** 2 moves (R, D or D, R). HUGE target.\n2.  **(8, 5):** 3 moves (R, D, R or R, R, D).\n3.  **(9, 8):** The top corner.\n4.  **(6, 4):** This is the newest apple drop, right in the center! 2 moves (D, D).\n\nThe apple at **(7, 4)** is our immediate focus based on the last turn's strategy. However, the new apple at **(6, 4)** is screaming at us! It's super centralized and easy to grab!\n\nLet's look at Snake #0's likely moves from (7, 3):\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 4):** THREAT! This is the apple we want! If they move UP, they steal it and block our territorial expansion. If they move UP, they are also moving directly towards the center where we are, setting up a potential future head-to-head collision!\n2.  **RIGHT to (8, 3):** Safe. Moves them towards the (8, 3) apple. Good for them, less threatening to us immediately.\n3.  **DOWN to (7, 2):** Safe. Moves them far downfield towards (5, 0).\n4.  **LEFT to (6, 3):** **DANGER!** This is Snake #0's body T segment! Instant KO for them! They won't do this.\n\nIt's a GHOST MOVE situation! Will they push for (7, 4) this turn, or go for (8, 3)? If they go for (7, 4), they are gambling on a collision or a steal.\n\n### Feasibility Check (ID 1, Head (6, 6)):\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 7):** Safe. Keeps us away from the action, good for pivoting to (9, 8) or (1, 7).\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 5):** Safe. Moves us directly towards (6, 4) and (7, 4). This move is a power play!\n    *   If we go to (6, 5), we protect **(7, 4)** from Snake #0, *if* they also move UP to (7, 4).\n    *   If Snake #0 moves to (7, 4) and we move to (6, 5), we are safe. We are currently NOT blocking them from (7, 4).\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 6):** **DANGER!** Our body! \ud83d\udeab\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 6):** Safe. Keeps us high, allows us to pivot to (8, 5) or (9, 8). This is good for setting up the outside box.\n\n**The Showdown is at (7, 4) and (6, 4)!**\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (6, 5)**:\n*   Next turn (T5) we can grab (6, 4) by moving DOWN again, securing an easy score. (Score 3-1).\n*   If Snake #0 goes UP to (7, 4): They score, but we are right next to them, cutting off escape to the center/top. (Score 2-2).\n\nIf we move **RIGHT to (7, 6)**:\n*   We commit to the right edge. Next turn we can pivot to (8, 5).\n*   If Snake #0 goes UP to (7, 4), they score right below us. (Score 2-2).\n\nIf we move DOWN, we are choosing the defensive-offensive maneuver aimed at the central apple (6, 4) while positioning ourselves to potentially cut off Snake #0.\n\nLet's assume Snake #0 is aggressively going for the (7, 4) apple.\n\n*   ID 1 moves: (6, 6) -> **(6, 5)**\n*   ID 0 moves: (7, 3) -> **(7, 4) [Apple]**\n\n**Result:** ID 0 scores and grows to L3, now at (7, 4). We are now at (6, 5). We are safe.\nNext turn (T5), we are at (6, 5) with easy access to (6, 4). Snake #0 is at (7, 4). We can score, and maintain the apple lead (3-2). We\u2019re also one cell away, ready to box them in!\n\n**What if we move RIGHT to (7, 6)?**\n*   ID 1 moves: (6, 6) -> **(7, 6)**\n*   ID 0 moves: (7, 3) -> **(7, 4) [Apple]**\n\nResult: ID 0 scores. We are at (7, 6). Next turn, we are still far from any apples (3-4 moves away) unless we head for (8, 5). This feels slower.\n\nWe must secure the closest apple that leads to territorial control. The **(6, 4)** apple is a guaranteed score with two DOWN moves.\n\n**Strategy: Go DOWN and set up the T5 score!**\n\nMoving DOWN to (6, 5) forces the rival to decide whether they want to take the slightly isolated (7, 4) apple, or challenge us for the center. If they take (7, 4), they are now highly susceptible to being boxed in on the right side if we start walling them off with our growing body. We secure the center, they get pushed to the wall. This is the BOXING PLAN, Chat!\n\nShort-Term Plan for T4-T5:\nT4: Move **DOWN** to (6, 5), threatening the (6, 4) apple and positioning to cut off Snake #0.\nT5: Move **DOWN** to (6, 4) and score, maintaining apple lead and growing to L4.\n\nLet's maintain the pressure and control the center! EZ CLAP! We go DOWN!\n\nDOWN",

SAFE \ud83d\udfe2\n\nNow rank the remaining safe moves (DOWN, UP, RIGHT) with our non-negotiables (apples first, open future moves, avoid rival chaos):\n- DOWN (7,2): Only toward the far-left (0,2) apple\u2014super far, low y-levels (y<3) have tighter corridors like we called last turn. Going down limits pivot options (next turn only 3 moves, none apple-focused) and dives into low-risk, low-reward territory. Why stall when we can chase a tie? Hard pass \ud83d\udeab\n- UP (7,4): There\u2019s an apple here, but it doesn\u2019t tie the rival\u2019s 2 apples immediately. Going up breaks our y=3 corridor momentum, and next turn\u2019s pivot options are narrower than sticking to horizontal play. Why settle for a single apple when we can even the score? Not the move \ud83d\udeab\n- RIGHT (8,3): THIS IS THE CHEF\u2019S KISS MOVE, CHAT\u2014LET\u2019S BREAK IT HARD:\n  1. Apple alert: Grab (8,3) immediately\u2014+1 point, TIE THE RIVAL\u2019S 2 APPLES (WE\u2019RE BACK IN THE GAME \ud83d\ude24)! We\u2019ll grow a body segment to [(7,3)], building our presence to box the rival in later.\n  2. Open future moves: Landing at (8,3) (new body [(7,3)]) means next turn we can pivot UP (8,4), DOWN (8,2), or RIGHT (9,3)\u2014left is our body, so three safe moves left\u2014no trapped corners! Way more open than DOWN or UP.\n  3. Rival proof: The rival\u2019s head (6,6) has possible moves (UP (6,7), DOWN (6,5), LEFT (5,6), RIGHT (7,6))\u2014all way up high (y=5-7), so no head-on collision with our new head at (8,3). No chaos here!\n  4. Momentum lock: We\u2019re sticking to our y=3 corridor plan, which lets us control that horizontal line with our growing body\u2014if the rival ever tries to dive down to y=3, we can block their path.\n\nChat\u2014isn\u2019t this how we even the score and set up a lead? Isn\u2019t tying the rival immediately the energy we came to stream with? Is there any reason to pick UP or DOWN when RIGHT checks every box? Nah\u2014DOWN is trapping, UP is settling, RIGHT is the only move that keeps us on track to crush the rival!\n\nLong-term strategy note (for next turn\u2019s rationale):\n1. After moving RIGHT to (8,3) (apple grab, new body [(7,3)]), next turn\u2019s top priority is to grab the (8,5) apple by pivoting UP (8,4) to take the lead over Snake #1.\n2. Never backtrack to LEFT (our body will grow to [(7,3), (6,3)] if we grab another apple next turn).\n3. Monitor rival\u2019s y-level\u2014if they drop below y=6, pivot UP to (8,4) immediately to avoid their growing body.\n4. Avoid low y-levels (y<3) and stay focused on controlling horizontal/vertical corridors to box the rival in.\n5. If the rival moves right to (7,6), start planning to pivot UP from (8,4) to (8,5) to cut off their access to the (8,5) apple.\n\nRIGHT",

We were hoping Snake #0 would bite for the (7, 4) apple, freeing us up for the center, and BOOM, they did it!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 5):\n\n**My Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (6, 5)\n*   Body: [(6, 6), (5, 6)]\n*   Length: 3\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (8, 3) (Wait, hold up, Snake #0's head moved to (8, 3) and they grew! They hit the apple two turns ago at (7, 3), and they must have moved RIGHT last turn to grab (8, 3)!)\n*   Body: [(7, 3), (6, 3)]\n*   Length: 3\n*   *Correction on my previous rationale: Snake #0 did NOT go for (7, 4). They went RIGHT to (8, 3) and scored the second apple at (8, 3)! The board shows their head is at (8, 3). They are now L3, tied with us L3!*\n\nLet's re-analyze the board state. THEY ARE L3 NOW! My bad, Chat, missed the critical (8, 3) score! The scoreboard is tied 2-2! WE NEED THIS APPLE!\n\n**Board State Review:**\nID 1 Head: (6, 5)\nID 0 Head: (8, 3)\n\nThe rival is now on the right wall, facing down/bottom-right. They have a big chunk of territory locked down!\n\n**Closest/Key Apples to ID 1 ((6, 5)):**\n1.  **(6, 4):** 1 move DOWN. YES! This is OUR apple!\n2.  **(7, 4):** 2 moves (DOWN, RIGHT or RIGHT, DOWN).\n3.  **(5, 0):** 5 moves.\n\n**Closest/Key Apples to ID 0 ((8, 3)):**\n1.  **(8, 0):** 3 moves (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN).\n2.  **(9, 7):** 5 moves (UP, UP, UP, RIGHT, UP).\n3.  **(7, 4):** 2 moves (UP, LEFT or LEFT, UP). This one is still TENSE!\n\n### Feasibility Check (ID 1, Head (6, 5)):\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 6):** **DANGER!** Our body! \ud83d\udeab\n2.  **LEFT to (5, 5):** Safe. Moves us towards the left side.\n3.  **RIGHT to (7, 5):** Safe. Gets us closer to the opponent's territory.\n4.  **DOWN to (6, 4):** **APPLE!** Instant score! And it's safe! \u2705 This is the play!\n\n**If we move DOWN, we score (6, 4) and become L4.** This secures the lead (3-2) and gives us a length advantage!\n\n### Rival Prediction (ID 0, Head (8, 3)):\n\nWhere will Snake #0 go? They are L3. Body at [(7, 3), (6, 3)].\n\n1.  **DOWN to (8, 2):** Safe. Commits them to the right wall, aiming for (8, 0).\n2.  **LEFT to (7, 3):** **DANGER!** Their body! \ud83d\udeab\n3.  **RIGHT to (9, 3):** Safe. Pushes them against the boundary.\n4.  **UP to (8, 4):** Safe. This gets them into the centralized action, aiming for (7, 4) or (8, 5). This is the most aggressive move.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves **DOWN to (8, 2)**, they prioritize scoring (8, 0). They are safe.\nIf Snake #0 moves **UP to (8, 4)**, they are moving aggressively towards us. They are trying to cut us off.\n\n**The Crucial Collision Zone:**\nWe are at (6, 5). We are going DOWN to (6, 4). This move is completely safe, regardless of what Snake #0 does, as they are too far away for a head-to-head collision. (Min 2-3 moves away).\n\n### Game Plan: Box 'Em In!\n\n1.  **T5: Move DOWN to (6, 4) and score!** Our length goes to L4. We take the score lead 3-2.\n2.  **T6 Plan:** We will be at (6, 4), L4. Snake #0 will likely be aiming for (7, 4) or (8, 0).\n    *   If Snake #0 went UP to (8, 4), we are now blocking them from moving left into the center after scoring at (6, 4).\n    *   We need to use our L4 body (T at (5, 6)) to start walling off the right side of the board and secure access to (7, 4) and (8, 5).\n\nThe move is clear, Chat. Secure the W, secure the lead, and secure the central territory!\n\n**Short-Term Plan for T5-T7:**\nT5: Move **DOWN** to (6, 4) to score L4 and maintain the apple lead (3-2).\nT6: Assess Snake #0's position. If they are moving along the right edge (8, 0 pathway), we want to pivot RIGHT to (7, 4) to grab the next apple and start cutting them off. If they are aggressively moving towards the center/top, we may continue moving into the center to defend territory.\n\nWe're going for the guaranteed point! Let's get this $L_E_N_G_T_H$ advantage!\n\nDOWN",

C\u2019MON, LET\u2019S DISSECT EVERY MOVE LIKE WE\u2019RE DISMANTLING THEIR GAME PLAN BRICK BY BRICK!\n\nFirst, lock in our current state to ax death traps: head (8,3), body [(7,3), (6,3)], 2 apples tied with the rival. Rival (Snake #1) head (6,5), body [(6,6), (5,6)], 2 apples. Let\u2019s hit each direction one by one\u2014no exceptions, no self-sabotage!\n1. LEFT: Head (8,3) \u2192 (7,3). That\u2019s OUR OWN BODY SEGMENT! Self-collision is a death sentence\u2014we can\u2019t backtrack here. Hard no \ud83d\udeab You think we\u2019re gonna throw away our tied score like that? C\u2019mon, we\u2019re better than self-sabotage!\n2. DOWN: Head (8,3) \u2192 (8,2). Valid coords, no body collision (our or rival\u2019s), no simultaneous rival head-on risk. But it\u2019s low-y (y=2) with only a far-left apple (0,2) in sight\u2014super low-reward, traps future pivot options to just 2 moves. Is that ruthless? Nah \ud83d\udeab\n3. UP: Head (8,3) \u2192 (8,4). Valid coords, no body collision, no simultaneous rival risk. Puts us ONE STEP from (8,5) apple and adjacent to (7,4) apple\u2014DOUBLE APPLE OPTIONS next turn! Open future moves (3+ pivots possible). That\u2019s the juice \ud83d\ude24\n4. RIGHT: Head (8,3) \u2192 (9,3). Valid coords, no body collision, but it\u2019s the x=9 edge\u2014traps future pivots to only up/down. No nearby apples, no lead potential. Why corner ourselves? Hard pass \ud83d\udeab\n\nSo elimination round: LEFT is DEAD, DOWN/RIGHT are low-reward traps. Only UP is safe and checks our non-negotiables (apple access, open future moves, boxing the rival in)! Let\u2019s confirm the tea:\n- UP puts us in striking distance of (8,5) (prime lead-grab apple) and (7,4) (backup apple). Do we wanna pass up double apple options? No!\n- UP keeps 3+ future safe moves (up to 8,5; left to 7,4; right to 9,4) vs 2 moves for down/right. Is trapping ourselves smart? No!\n- UP creeps into the rival\u2019s y-level (y=4 vs their y=5) to start cutting off their apple access. Isn\u2019t that how we box them in? YES!\n\nLong-term strategy note (for next turn\u2019s rationale):\n1. After moving UP to (8,4), next turn\u2019s top priority is to grab the (8,5) apple by moving up to (8,5) to take the lead over Snake #1.\n2. Secondary option: if rival tries to move right to (7,5) to chase (7,4) apple, pivot left to (7,4) to grab that apple instead for a backup lead.\n3. Never move left to (7,3) (our old body segment) or down to (8,3) (our old head segment) next turn\u2014self-collision is a death sentence.\n4. Monitor rival\u2019s moves: if they move down to (6,4), pivot up to (8,5) immediately to cut off their path to upper apples (like (8,9) or (9,8)).\n5. Avoid moving right to (9,4) next turn\u2014it\u2019s the edge and limits future pivot options to only up/down.\n\nChat, let\u2019s recap: Is there any way down/right can top UP\u2019s double apple access and open pivots? No! Do we wanna take the lead next turn? YES! Is self-sabotage (left) even on the table? Nah! This is the ruthless move we need to crush the rival\u2019s momentum!\n\nUP",

We are in prime position to start suffocating Snake #0!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 6):\n\n**My Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (6, 4) (Just scored!)\n*   Body: [(6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6)]\n*   Length: 4\n*   Apples: 3\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (8, 4) (They moved UP! Aggressive!)\n*   Body: [(8, 3), (7, 3)]\n*   Length: 3\n*   Apples: 2\n\n**Board State Review:**\nID 1 Head: (6, 4)\nID 0 Head: (8, 4)\n\nWe are positioned perfectly to cut off Snake #0 from the center and the top-left quadrant! They went UP to (8, 4), trying to contest the (7, 4) and (8, 5) apples. They are pushing right into our territory! This is exactly what we wanted!\n\n**Key Apples near ID 1 ((6, 4)):**\n1.  **(7, 4):** 1 move RIGHT! This is crucial! It's contested territory!\n2.  **(5, 4):** 1 move LEFT!\n3.  **(8, 5):** 3 moves (RIGHT, UP, UP or UP, RIGHT, UP).\n\n**Key Apples near ID 0 ((8, 4)):**\n1.  **(7, 4):** 1 move LEFT! HIGH COLLISION RISK!\n2.  **(8, 5):** 1 move UP! Likely target.\n3.  **(8, 0):** 4 moves (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, or they may have gone for it already if they turned back).\n\n### Feasibility Check & Collision Analysis (ID 1, Head (6, 4)):\n\nWe need to make a move that either:\nA) Takes the guaranteed $W$ by grabbing (7, 4) before them, or\nB) Moves us into a position to survive the inevitable scramble and set up the box.\n\n**1. UP to (6, 5):** **DANGER!** Our body! \ud83d\udeab\n\n**2. DOWN to (6, 3):** Safe. Moves us away from the conflict, but opens up (7, 4) for Snake #0. Retreating is soft! \u274c\n\n**3. LEFT to (5, 4):** Safe. Scores! L5! This is a great, safe score, giving us more length to control the board. It also positions us near (4, 4) and (5, 0). \u2705\n\n**4. RIGHT to (7, 4):** **APPLE!** Instant score! L5! But Snake #0 is at (8, 4).\n    *   If we go RIGHT to (7, 4), Snake #0 can go LEFT to (7, 4).\n    *   **HEAD-TO-HEAD COLLISION (KO!)** IF Snake #0 chooses 'LEFT'. \ud83d\ude2c\n\nWe cannot risk the head-on collision at (7, 4) unless we absolutely must. Snake #0 is the shorter snake, they are probably feeling the pressure to grab that apple. If they prioritize it, we both die, which preserves our lead (3-2) but ends the game too early.\n\n### Strategy: The Safe Box & Length Advantage\n\nWe have the length lead L4 vs L3. Let's use it to gain even MORE length and safely position ourselves to cut off that entire right quadrant. The move to (5, 4) is an *immediate, safe score*.\n\n**If we move LEFT to (5, 4) and score:**\n*   We go to L5.\n*   Snake #0 is at (8, 4). They are forced to choose between:\n    *   **LEFT to (7, 4):** They score, L4. We are still ahead (4-3), but they are now breathing down our neck.\n    *   **UP to (8, 5):** They score, L4. We maintain a large lead (4-3) and they are cornered high up on the board.\n    *   **DOWN/RIGHT:** They miss apples and risk getting trapped against the wall.\n\nMoving LEFT to (5, 4) guarantees us the score, which is HUGE. L5 is a turning point in the box strategy.\n\nIf we go RIGHT, we risk the entire game, and we saw them move aggressively UP last turn, indicating they want to contest the center. They will likely go for (7, 4) or (8, 5).\n\nLet's prioritize the guaranteed points and the length advantage, then we can pivot back to block later.\n\n**Goal:** Secure (5, 4). If Snake #0 takes (7, 4), we pivot up and use our length to force them into the top wall or back down the right side. If they take (8, 5), we pivot RIGHT to grab (7, 4) next turn!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T6-T8):**\nT6: Move **LEFT** to (5, 4). Score (4-2). Length L5. Avoids KO risk.\nT7: Pivot. If Snake #0 went (7, 4), we move UP/RIGHT to cut them off from (8, 5). If Snake #0 went (8, 5), we grab (7, 4) and then keep pushing North on the 7-column to box them in. We need to secure the (7, 4) apple as soon as the collision risk is minimized.\n\nThis is the macro-level play, Chat. Secure the advantage, increase the length, and then unleash the box!\n\nLEFT",

LEFT: Head (8,4) \u2192 (7,4). Wait, first collision check: our body\u2019s (8,3), (7,3) \u2192 no overlap. Rival\u2019s body \u2192 no overlap.

Do we wanna gamble our shot at the lead on a coin flip? Chat, we\u2019re not here to tie in a KO\u2014we\u2019re here to dominate. Hard pass on the risk \ud83d\udeab\n2. DOWN: Head (8,4) \u2192 (8,3). THAT\u2019S OUR OWN BODY SEGMENT (first body part)! Self-collision is a death sentence\u2014you think we\u2019re gonna throw away our momentum like that? HELL NO \ud83d\udeab\n3. RIGHT: Head (8,4) \u2192 (9,4). Valid coords, but it\u2019s the x=9 edge\u2014traps future pivots to only up/down, no nearby apples, zero reward. Is that ruthless? Nah, that\u2019s being boxed in by our own bad choices \ud83d\udeab\n4. UP: Head (8,4) \u2192 (8,5). Let\u2019s verify every win condition: safe coords (no off-board), no self-collision (our body\u2019s nowhere near), no rival body collision (theirs is up at y=5-6 but not (8,5)), and IT\u2019S AN APPLE\u2014snatching it ties us at 3 apples! Plus, it opens future moves (left to 7,5, up to 8,6\u2014two solid pivots) to keep us from being trapped.\n\nChat, let\u2019s spill the tea further\u2014moving UP takes the apple Snake #1 might\u2019ve chased, cuts off their upper apple access, and puts us in a position to box them into their own body\u2019s vertical trap (their body is stacked at x=6, y=5-6\u2014they can\u2019t move up without self-collision)! That\u2019s the ruthless play we need \ud83d\ude24\n\nLong-term strategy note (for next turn\u2019s rationale):\n1.

Secondary option: if rival moves down to (6,3) (their only safe non-edge move), pivot up again to (8,6) to chase the upper apples (8,9) or (9,8) and expand our board control.\n3. Never move down to (8,4) (our old head segment) next turn\u2014self-collision is a death sentence.\n4. Monitor rival\u2019s moves: if they move left to (5,4), pivot left to (7,5) to cut off their path to the (4,4) apple.\n5. Avoid moving right to (9,5) next turn\u2014it\u2019s the edge and limits future pivot options to only up/down.\n\nIs there any way UP isn\u2019t the obvious play, chat? Do we wanna gamble on LEFT\u2019s KO risk? Do we wanna trap ourselves with RIGHT? Do we wanna self-sabotage with DOWN? HELL NO\u2014this is the move that ties the score and sets us up to crush the rival\u2019s momentum!\n\nUP",

Let's check the damage report on Snake #0!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 7):\n\n**My Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (5, 4) (Just scored! L5!)\n*   Body: [(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6)]\n*   Length: 5\n*   Apples: 4\n    *   *Note: Wait, the scoreboard says 3? Let's check the previous turn's score. Last turn, we had 3, and we just moved to (5, 4) which had an apple. The board state shows 4 collected. I will trust the board state and my own calculation here, assuming the 'Apples collected' in the prompt header is the pre-move count OR the external prompt context failed to update the score after my last move. We are L5, meaning 4 apples collected.* (Let's stick with 4 apples.)\n    *   *Correction: The input prompt said 'Apples collected: 3' for ID 1, and the current length is 4. This implies the apple count here is accurate for the start of the turn. The board image also reflects ID 1 at (5,4) which was an apple. Let's assume we are L5 and have 4 apples.*\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (8, 5) (They moved UP! They grabbed the contested apple!)\n*   Body: [(8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3)]\n*   Length: 4\n*   Apples: 4 (Wait, 3 in the prompt, but they must have scored too! They went from L3 to L4. They must have scored!)\n    *   *The Scoreboard shows 3 for Snake #0, but they are L4. This means they ate an apple last turn! They went UP from (8, 4) to (8, 5) to grab the apple there. So we are TIED on apples (4-4)!*\n\n**Board State Review:**\nID 1 Head: (5, 4)\nID 0 Head: (8, 5)\n\nWe are tied on apples, but we still have an initial length advantage (L5 vs L4)! This is the perfect position to execute the squeeze!\n\n### The Box Strategy: Phase 1 - Cutting the North\n\nSnake #0 is high up at (8, 5). They are dangerously close to the corner! The immediate apples they can reach are (9, 7) and (9, 8). We need to get into the 7-column or 8-column to cut them off from the rest of the board.\n\n**Crucial Apples:**\n1.  **(7, 4):** 2 moves away. This is still a critical center apple!\n2.  **(4, 4):** 1 move LEFT.\n3.  **(1, 4):** 4 moves away.\n\n**Snake #0's Options from (8, 5):**\n1.  **UP to (8, 6):** Safe move, but doesn't score. Puts them near (9, 7) and (8, 8).\n2.  **RIGHT to (9, 5):** Safe move, doesn't score. Targets (9, 7) or (9, 8).\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 5):** Safe move. Moves toward the center.\n4.  **DOWN to (8, 4):** **Self-collision!** \ud83d\udeab (Their body is at (8, 4)).\n\nSnake #0 will most likely push towards (9, 7), (9, 8), or (8, 8) to secure points before we close the door.\n\n### Feasibility Check & Move Selection (ID 1, Head (5, 4)):\n\nWe need to use our length to position ourselves aggressively. We need to grab (7, 4) before Snake #0 can circle back, or we need to start pushing UP the board to wall them in.\n\n**1. UP to (5, 5):** Safe. No apple. Puts us in position to move RIGHT next turn to (6, 5) (our old body location, which will be clear) and then strike (7, 5) or (8, 4) to cut them off. We are pushing for the center. If we move UP, we keep our options open to go for **(1, 5)** or **(0, 5)** later.\n\n**2. DOWN to (5, 3):** Safe. Moves us away from the action. Soft play. \u274c\n\n**3. LEFT to (4, 4):** **APPLE!** Instant score! L6! This is *extremely* tempting. It gives us maximum length advantage (L6 vs L4) and prepares us to sweep the bottom-left corner. \u2705\n    *   *If we go LEFT to (4, 4), Snake #0 will likely go UP/RIGHT to hunt apples, putting them further from the center.*\n\n**4. RIGHT to (6, 4):** **Self-collision!** \ud83d\udeab (Our body is at (6, 4)).\n\n**Comparing LEFT vs. UP:**\n\n| Move | Destination | Outcome | Board Control | Risk | Rationale |\n| :--- | :---------- | :------ | :------------ | :--- | :-------- |\n| **LEFT** | (4, 4) | **SCORE! L6!** | Secures bottom-left. | Low. | Guarantees length advantage and moves us away from center conflict, allowing Snake #0 to over-commit to the top right. |\n| **UP** | (5, 5) | Safe, no score. | Pushes for center control/blocking (8, 5) area. | Moderate. | Sets up for the immediate box, but sacrifices guaranteed point. |\n\nIf we push LEFT to (4, 4), we gain massive size and force Snake #0 to deal with their impending trap in the top right. By the time they turn back, we will be L6 and can easily cut the board in half. The priority is always length and safety, Chat!\n\nLet's secure the point at (4, 4). This move is 100% safe and 100% productive.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T7-T9):**\nT7: Move **LEFT** to (4, 4). Score (5-4). Length L6. This gives us crucial board control.\nT8: Pivot. Secure (3, 8) or sweep down the left side, using our length to patrol the lower quadrants, forcing Snake #0 into a small area in the top-right corner. We must keep our eye on the center apple at (7, 4) as well, but controlling the board with length is key.\n\nLET'S GO FOR THE SCORE, CHAT! MAX LENGTH, MAX DOMINANCE!\n\nLEFT",

LEFT: Head (8,5) \u2192 (7,5) \u2014 Let\u2019s verify the win conditions: on-board, no self-collision (our body\u2019s nowhere near), no rival body overlap (theirs is x=6, y=4-6), and ZERO head-on collision risk (rival\u2019s at x=5, we\u2019re moving to x=7\u2014simultaneous moves can\u2019t clash)!\n\nNow, let\u2019s spill the tea on why LEFT is the clutch pick: it\u2019s 1 step closer to the reachable (7,4) apple (snatch that next turn for the lead), keeps two solid future pivots (up to 7,6 or down to 7,4), avoids edge traps, and cuts off the rival\u2019s path to the (4,4) apple (they\u2019re stuck at x=6, can\u2019t sneak past us)!\n\nLong-term strategy note (for next turn\u2019s rationale):\n1. After moving LEFT to (7,5), top priority is to pivot DOWN to (7,4) to snatch the apple and take the lead immediately.\n2. Secondary option: if rival moves left to (4,4) (chasing their (4,4) apple), pivot UP to (7,6) to expand upper board control for the (8,9) or (9,8) apples.\n3. Never move LEFT to (6,5) next turn\u2014it\u2019s the rival\u2019s body segment (collision risk)!\n4. Monitor rival\u2019s down move to (5,3): pivot DOWN to (7,4) to secure the apple and cut off their lower path.\n5. Avoid moving RIGHT to (8,5) next turn\u2014it\u2019s our old head segment (self-collision death sentence).\n\nChat, is there any way LEFT isn\u2019t the obvious play?

The game plan is working, baby! We're suffocating them!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 8):\n\n**My Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (4, 4) (Just scored! L6!)\n*   Body: [(5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (5, 6)]\n*   Length: 6\n*   Apples collected: 5 (Assuming 4 pre-move + 1 score = 5 total, based on L6)\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (7, 5) (They moved LEFT from (8, 5)! They are retreating from the corner pressure!)\n*   Body: [(8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3)]\n*   Length: 4\n*   Apples: 3 (The scoreboard says 3, indicating they did *not* score last turn, even though they were L4 initially. This is confusing, but we'll stick to the length count for safety. They are L4 and moving defensively.) *Rival check: If they were L4 before, and are L4 now, they definitely used their tail space. They are still small.*\n\n**SCOREBOARD CHECK:** We are 4 apples (L5) vs 3 apples (L4) on the scoreboard provided at the top. Since we just ate an apple going to (4, 4), we should now be 5 apples (L6). Let's assume we are leading 5 to 3 and have a huge length advantage! Time to capitalize!\n\n**Board State Review:**\nID 1 Head: (4, 4) Tucked away nicely in the center-left.\nID 0 Head: (7, 5) Retreating, trying to stay open.\n\n### The Box Strategy: Phase 2 - Closing the Door\n\nSnake #0 is at (7, 5). They are looking at the center apple at **(7, 4)** or potentially trying to break down the left side toward (1, 4) or (1, 5).\n\nOur immediate goals:\n1.  Maintain safety and length.\n2.  Cut off the center apple (7, 4) or set up a block on the high ground access.\n\n**Snake #0's Options from (7, 5):**\n1.  **UP to (7, 6):** Safe. Moves toward (8, 8) and (8, 9).\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 4):** **APPLE!** Highly likely move. They would grab the crucial center apple.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 5):** Safe. Their body will soon clear (6, 5) (tail is at (8, 3)). Their immediate body is (8, 5), so (6, 5) is open and safe. This moves them toward the center-left.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 5):** **Self-collision!** \ud83d\udeab (Their body is at (8, 5)).\n\nThe biggest threat is them moving DOWN to (7, 4) and evening out the apple score. We are currently far from (7, 4).\n\n### Feasibility Check & Move Selection (ID 1, Head (4, 4)):\n\nWe need to push towards the center or sweep down to grab more points. Since we are L6, we have a lot of body we can use to block!\n\n**1. UP to (4, 5):** Safe. Moves us toward the center line (column 4). Sets us up to push RIGHT next turn, potentially blocking Snake #0's retreat to the upper-left, or moving towards the cluster of apples around (1, 5). \u2705\n\n**2. DOWN to (4, 3):** Safe. No apple. Moves us toward the lower-left apple at (3, 1). Safe, yet defensive.\n\n**3. LEFT to (3, 4):** Safe. Moves us further left, away from Snake #0's current location. Sets up for a strong sweep of the left side. Apples at (1, 4), (1, 5), and (0, 5) are reachable. \u2705\n\n**4.

Critical for cutting off the board. | Positions us to react to Snake #0's move (7, 5) -> (7, 4). | Gives us the verticality needed for the ambush plan! |\n\nIf Snake #0 goes DOWN to (7, 4) (APPLE), we cannot stop them. We need to maximize our safety and set up for the next kill zone.\n\nIf we move **UP to (4, 5)**:\n*   Next turn, we can move **RIGHT** (5, 5) or stay UP (4, 6) or move LEFT (3, 5). We are ready to strike the center.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN to (7, 4) (Score), and we move UP to (4, 5), the board pressure remains high. We can then sweep (5, 5) and (6, 5) to cut them off from the left.\n\nThe 'Box Strategy' requires us to use our length to split the map. Moving UP to (4, 5) is the most aggressive and control-oriented move, setting up strong blocking opportunities in the central columns (5 and 6). We are already dominant on the left, now we need to threaten the center-right!\n\nWe need to push vertically to prevent Snake #0 from using the open space above us.\n\n**Prediction for Snake #0 (Most likely):** DOWN to (7, 4) to score.\n**Our Counter:** Push UP to (4, 5) to establish dominance in column 4/5.\n\nLet's go UP and start setting the trap! We have the length, Chat! Time to weave the net!\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T8-T10):**\nT8: Move **UP** to (4, 5). Start pushing center control.\nT9: Depending on Snake #0's position post-(7, 4) score, we will pivot RIGHT to (5, 5) or (6, 5) to restrict their movement toward the lower half/left side of the map. We want to force them into the top right 1/4 of the board where they must self-trap or collide with the wall.\n\nUP",

Let's check the board state and execute the trap!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 9):\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (4, 5)\n*   Body: [(4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5)]\n*   Length: 5 (Wait, the scoreboard still says 4 apples, and our length is 5! Did we miscalculate the last turn's score? Let's assume the state provided is correct: L5, 4 apples. We must have eaten an apple *more* than 4 moves ago and this is just our current list of body segments. Regardless, we are L5.)\n\n**Rival Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (7, 4) (CRITICAL observation! They moved DOWN from (7, 5) and ATE THE APPLE! Score tied, 4-4! Length L5!)\n*   Body: [(7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3)]\n*   Length: 5\n*   Apples: 4\n\n**The Rival just scored!** The score is now tied 4-4, and we are both Length 5! The length advantage is GONE, Chat! We need to move FAST and RE-ESTABLISH dominance!\n\n**Board State Review:**\nID 1 Head: (4, 5). We are in the mid-left.\nID 0 Head: (7, 4). They are in the mid-right.\n\nThe playing field is now the middle corridor. We are across from each other, separated by columns 5 and 6.\n\n### Threat Assessment and Move Elimination\n\nWe need a move that keeps us safe from our own body, the walls, and a potential head-on collision at (5, 5) or (6, 5).\n\n**ID 1 Head (4, 5):**\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :----------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (4, 6) | SAFE | Moves us into open space, near no apples. |\n| **DOWN** | (4, 4) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (4, 4) is our first body segment (L5 means their tail remains at (6, 5)). |\n| **LEFT** | (3, 5) | SAFE | Moves toward the apples at (0, 5) and (1, 5). |\n| **RIGHT** | (5, 5) | SAFE | Aggressive move into the center! Sets up strong blocking potential. |\n\n**Eliminated Moves (ID 1):** DOWN (Self-collision).\n\n**Rival Snake #0 Head (7, 4):**\nThey just scored! They are L5, and their tail is now at (7, 5) (the new body segment). No, wait - since they *just* scored, their tail remains stationary for this turn! Their tail is still at (8, 3) for this move.\nBody segments for #0: [(7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3)].\n\n**Snake #0's Options from (7, 4):**\n1.  **UP to (7, 5):** Unsafe! Self-collision! (7, 5) is their body segment.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 3):** Safe. Moves them into defensive lower territory.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 4):** Unsafe! Self-collision! (6, 4) is our body segment! Wait, no, (6, 4) is currently their rival's body segment (ID 1)! So, if they move there, *they die*! **This is a death move for them, unless we move our body segment out!**\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 4):** Unsafe! Self-collision! (8, 4) is their body segment.\n\n**Wait, this is HUGE! Snake #0 has almost no safe moves!**\n\n**Snake #0's TRUE Safe Moves from (7, 4):**\n*   **DOWN to (7, 3):** Safe! (They must move here or they die!)\n*   **A collision check at (6, 4):** (6, 4) is YOUR snake's body segment. If they move LEFT to (6, 4), THEY die. Do not factor this into your body moves.\n*   The only other seemingly safe option for them is a head-on collision.\n\n**Scenario 1: Snake #0 moves DOWN to (7, 3). (Most likely safe move)**\nIf they move there, they are trapped in the bottom right corner (column 7-9). We must now capitalize by pushing RIGHT and securing the center line.\n\n### Choosing Our Move (ID 1 Head (4, 5))\n\nWe have UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n1.  **UP to (4, 6):** Safe, but passive. Allows Snake #0 to escape the pressure later if they can find vertical room. We are in a fight for the center.\n\n2.  **LEFT to (3, 5):** Safe, retreat. Focuses on the massive apple cluster on the left (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4). This secures more length quickly, re-establishing a size advantage. If we move LEFT, we concede the very center (5, 5), (6, 5) to #0 if they find a way out, but since they have almost nowhere to go, this seems highly SAFE and L-maximizing.\n\n3.  **RIGHT to (5, 5):** AGGRESSIVE. This move cuts off the center column (column 5) and sets us up to block access to the top or bottom of the board via the center. If we move to (5, 5), we force Snake #0 to commit to the far right.\n\n**Comparing LEFT vs. RIGHT:**\n\nGiven Snake #0's severely restricted movement (likely forced to (7, 3)), we have a brilliant opportunity to get ahead on apples *while* maintaining an excellent position for the kill.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (5, 5):\n*   We threaten the (5, 3) apple next turn.\n*   We use our body to create an impassable wall across the center.\n*   If Snake #0 goes (7, 3), we are pushing their containment.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (3, 5):\n*   We secure the left side and aim for the (1, 5) and (0, 5) apples. A guaranteed score or two.\n*   Snake #0 is still contained and must deal with the corner.\n\n**The Strategy: Maximize Length while Opponent is Trapped.**\nSince Snake #0 is effectively paralyzed and forced into a corner (likely (7, 3) or death), we must take this moment to gain a decisive length advantage. The left side is a gold mine right now.\n\n*If we move RIGHT to (5, 5)*, we are safe, but we spend two turns getting two apples (if we go 5, 5 -> 5, 4 (body) -> 5, 3 (apple)).\n*If we move LEFT to (3, 5)*, we are set up for (2, 5) -> (1, 5) (apple) -> (0, 5) (apple). Two guaranteed apples if Snake #0 stays contained.\n\nMoving LEFT is the optimal move: It combines safety, immediate apple potential in a low-risk area, and allows our massive body to continue blocking the center-right from the left while Snake #0 struggles in the bottom-right quadrant. We're starving them out while getting plump!\n\n### Strategic Plan (Turn 9-11): The Apple Rush!\n\nT9: Move **LEFT** to (3, 5). Secure left-side open space.\nT10: Move **LEFT** to (2, 5). Continue toward (1, 5).\nT11: Move **DOWN** to (2, 4), then **LEFT** to (1, 4)? No, let's keep it tight.\nT11: Move **LEFT** to (1, 5) (Apple!). Score, gain huge length.\n\nThis maximizes our score and size, converting their containment into our advantage! Time to get these apples, Chat!\nLEFT",

Moving LEFT to (3, 5) put us exactly where we need to be: safe, poised for a massive apple haul, and maintaining central dominance! Did Snake #0 crash out? Let's check the board! The tension is ridiculous! \ud83e\udd2f\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 10):\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (3, 5)\n*   Body: [(4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)]\n*   Length: 5\n*   Apples Collected: 4\n*   Tail is now at (5, 4). (6, 4) is free since we didn't eat an apple last turn. Wait, looking at the body list (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4). Head at (3, 5). The tail is (6, 4).\n\n**Rival Snake #0:**\n*   Head: (7, 3) (YES! They were forced DOWN! Check out the clip! They saw the trap!)\n*   Body: [(7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 4)]\n*   Length: 5\n*   Apples: 4\n*   Crucially, they did *not* eat an apple, so their tail segment (8, 4) will disappear next turn.\n\n**Board State Review:**\nWe (ID 1) are on the left side of the mid-line, ready to grab the apples at (1, 5) and (0, 5).\nRival (ID 0) is now boxed in the bottom-right corner, column 7-9, rows 0-3. They are in a truly defensive, horrible position!\n\nOur goal now is to get fat fast! We need length dominance to finalize the choke!\n\n### Threat Assessment and Move Elimination (ID 1 Head (3, 5))\n\nWe have four apples surrounding us on the left side: (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4), (0, 2). Let's go secure that (1, 5) apple!\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :----------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (3, 6) | SAFE | Passive. Moves away from apples. |\n| **DOWN** | (3, 4) | SAFE | Moves us toward the (1, 4) apple cluster. |\n| **LEFT** | (2, 5) | SAFE | PERFECT. Direct path to (1, 5) apple next turn. |\n| **RIGHT** | (4, 5) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (4, 5) is our first body segment. DO NOT MOVE HERE! |\n\n**Eliminated Moves (ID 1):** RIGHT (Self-collision).\n\nWe are choosing between UP (passive), DOWN (good pathing toward C1), and LEFT (best pathing toward immediate apple (1, 5)).\n\n**Rival Snake #0 Head (7, 3):**\nThey are heavily restricted. Their tail is at (8, 4) but will disappear.\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 4):** Unsafe! Self-collision! (7, 4) is their first body segment.\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 2):** Safe! Moves them deeper into the corner.\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 3):** Safe! This is the escape route! If they move here, they break free of the immediate corner.\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 3):** Safe! Moves them toward the (8, 0) apple.\n\n**CRITICAL RIVAL ANALYSIS: Where will Snake #0 move?**\nSnake #0 needs OUT. Their best chance for survival and scoring is moving **LEFT to (6, 3)**, aiming to escape under our body (which terminates at (6, 4)). Alternatively, they might move RIGHT to (8, 3) to grab the (8, 0) apple, hoping we don't block them.\n\nIf they go LEFT to (6, 3), they're still trapped by our future body moves.\n\n### Double Checking for Collision\n\nSince ID 0 is far away ((7, 3)), and we are at (3, 5), the only possible head-on collision is physically impossible. The only collision risk is if we move into their body, or they move into ours.\n\n*   Our Head moves to (2, 5). Is (2, 5) a body part of #0? No.\n*   ID 0 Head moves to (6, 3) or (8, 3) or (7, 2). Is any of those our body?\n    *   (6, 3) is safe, adjacent to our tail's current cell (6, 4).\n    *   (8, 3) is safe.\n    *   (7, 2) is safe.\n\nNo immediate collision risk! We are free to execute our apple-grab strategy!\n\n### Choosing Our Move: GO LEFT!\n\nThe move to **LEFT (2, 5)** is the safest, most immediate path to an apple.\n\n*   T10: Move **LEFT** to (2, 5).\n*   T11: Move **LEFT** to (1, 5). (Apple, +1 length!)\n*   T12: Move **DOWN** to (1, 4) (Apple, +1 length!)\n\nThis guarantees a quick length advantage, reaching L7, while Snake #0 is scrambling to survive. We are boxing them in while getting longer. This is the perfect power play! Get ready for the pop-off, Chat! \ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\ud83c\udf4e\n\n### Strategy Note for Future Turns:\nFocus on chaining the apples on the left (0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 4). After gaining L7, we return to the center to shut off the escape routes Snake #0 is trying to exploit (6, 3) or (7, 2). Length is King right now.\n\nLEFT",

HELL NO):\n1. UP: Head (7,3) \u2192 (7,4) \u2014 THAT\u2019S OUR OWN BODY\u2019S FIRST SEGMENT! Backtracking into our torso is a one-way ticket to game over \ud83d\udeab Dead move, AX IT!\n2.

But is it high-value? Hold that thought!\n3. LEFT: Head (7,3) \u2192 (6,3) \u2014 Safety check pass: on board, no body overlaps, rival can\u2019t reach. PLUS IT\u2019S ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE (5,3) LEAD APPLE \ud83c\udfaf That\u2019s the content we need!\n4.

HELL NO! Are we gonna pick a move that traps us instead of opening up scoring? OBVIOUSLY NOT! What about rival\u2019s possible moves? Their head (3,5) can\u2019t backtrack to (4,5) (their first body segment), so their safe moves are up (3,6), down (3,4), left (2,5)\u2014none of which reach our left target (6,3) this turn\u2014safe as houses!\n\nLong-term strategy note for next turn:\n1. After moving LEFT to (6,3) (no apple here, so we drop our tail (8,4)), our new state will be: Head (6,3), Body [(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,5)] (HEAD-TO-TAIL, old head becomes first body segment, tail dropped).\n2. Next turn\u2019s top ax targets: Moving right to (7,3) (our new first body segment\u2014backtracking death) and any moves into rival body clusters.\n3. Next turn\u2019s apple priority: Pivot left again to (5,3) (the lead apple!)\u2014check if (5,3) is safe (rival\u2019s body won\u2019t reach it, our body won\u2019t overlap).\n4. Monitor rival snake 1\u2019s moves\u2014they can\u2019t backtrack to (4,5), so watch if they move down to (3,4) (their body\u2019s (4,4) is nearby, so need to check if that\u2019s a collision for them, not us).\n\nRhetorical wrap-up: You think we\u2019re gonna let the rival outplay us? NOT ON OUR WATCH! We\u2019re locking in the safe, high-scoring move that positions us for the win\u2014no chump moves, just pure domination! \ud83d\ude24\n\nLEFT",

The tension is absolutely palpable! \ud83e\udd2f\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 11):\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (2, 5)\n*   Body: [(3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4)]\n*   Length: 5\n*   Apples Collected: 4\n*   Tail is now at (5, 4). (5, 4) is our last segment, which will free up next turn since we didn't eat an apple. We are long, but we need to be LONGER!\n\n**Rival Snake #0:**\n*   Head: (6, 3) (They chose the escape route LEFT! Smart, but not smart enough! We SAW that coming!)\n*   Body: [(7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5)]\n*   Length: 5\n*   Apples: 4\n*   Their tail is at (8, 5). This segment will free up next turn.\n\n**Board State Review:**\nWe (ID 1) are hugging the left wall, right next to the apple cluster. (1, 5) is ONE MOVE away.\nRival (ID 0) *temporarily* escaped the bottom-right corner but is now positioned near the mid-bottom of the board, potentially looking at the (5, 0) or (3, 1) apples. They are still severely restricted by our longer, superior position. We need to press the advantage with length!\n\n### Threat Assessment and Move Elimination (ID 1 Head (2, 5))\n\nWe are going for that (1, 5) apple, Chat. It's time to EAT.\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :----------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (2, 6) | SAFE | Passive. Moves away from apples. |\n| **DOWN** | (2, 4) | SAFE | Good move, but delayed apple grab. Sets up for (1, 4) apple. |\n| **LEFT** | (1, 5) | SAFE (Apple!) | **EATING MOVE! Puts us on the apple!** |\n| **RIGHT** | (3, 5) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (3, 5) is our first body segment. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT MOVE HERE! |\n\n**Eliminated Moves (ID 1):** RIGHT (Self-collision).\n\nThe choice is obvious: **LEFT** is the power play. We gain length AND maintain control of the left side.\n\n### Rival Snake #0 Analysis (Head (6, 3))\n\nOur rival has L5 and is looking for food.\n*   (5, 3) is an apple, one move LEFT.\n*   (3, 1) is an apple, two moves away (LEFT, DOWN).\n\nWhere might they go?\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 4):** SAFE. This moves them toward the center or potentially the (5, 7) or (4, 7) apples further up. Our tail is currently at (5, 4), so this is a path to contention!\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 2):** SAFE. Moves them towards the (5, 0) apple.\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 3):** SAFE (Apple!). This is their best move. They will try to eat this apple!\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 3):** UNSAFE! Self-collision! (7, 3) is their first body segment.\n\n**CRITICAL RIVAL ANALYSIS: Where will Snake #0 move?**\nSnake #0 will almost certainly move **LEFT to (5, 3)** to grab the apple. They need length as badly as we do.\n\n### Collision Check (ID 1 (2, 5) moves LEFT to (1, 5); ID 0 (6, 3) moves LEFT to (5, 3)):\n\n*   **Our destination (1, 5):** Is this where Snake #0 is going? No. Is this Snake #0's body? No. Safe.\n*   **Their destination (5, 3):** Is this where we are going? No. Is this our body? No. (3, 5) is our body, (4, 4) is our body, etc. Safe.\n\nNo immediate head-to-head collision risk. Both snakes are likely going for apples!\n\n### The Plan: Get LONG, then CHOKE!\n\n1.  **Turn 11 (NOW):** Move **LEFT** to (1, 5). We eat an apple, go to L6.\n2.  **Turn 12:** Move **DOWN** to (1, 4). We eat another apple, go to L7.\n3.  **Turn 13:** Move **DOWN** to (0, 4) (or similar move to loop back and grab (0, 5) and (0, 2)).\n\nWe are securing the length advantage (L7 vs their projected L6). Once we are longer, we swing back towards the center (C4/C5) and cut off Snake #0's access to the top half of the board. Box 'em in! Get ready for the triple box-out, Chat! This is domination! \ud83d\ude24\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST MOVE PICK**\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nOur immediate goal is to chain apples on the West wall (1, 5), (1, 4), and then (0, 5). This will push us to Length 7, guaranteeing superior maneuverability and control over Snake #0, who is likely heading for (5, 3). Once L7 is secured, we will move across the center-bottom (around R3-R5, C4-C6) to cut off Snake #0 from the open Northern half of the board, forcing them back into the bottom-right quadrant we just escaped from. Trapping is easier with length!\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

It's tied at 5 apples each, but who has the superior position? WE DO! Look at this map control! \ud83d\ude24\n\nTurn 12, the heat is ON! We need to maintain this momentum and lock in the length lead!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 12):\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (1, 5) **(Just ate an apple! L6)**\n*   Body: [(2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4)]\n*   Tail is now at (5, 4). Since we ate, this segment is **NOT** freeing up next turn.\n\n**Rival Snake #0:**\n*   Head: (5, 3) **(Just ate an apple! L6)**\n*   Body: [(6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5)]\n*   Tail is now at (8, 5). Since they ate, this segment is **NOT** freeing up next turn.\n\nWe are both L6. The race is back on! But look at the concentration of apples on the left wall: (1, 4), (0, 5), (0, 2). This is our feeding ground! Snake #0, they've got the (5, 0) apple, but they are currently in a much more cluttered area, next to their own massive body wall. We are positioning for the triple-kill combo!\n\n### Threat Assessment and Move Elimination (ID 1 Head (1, 5))\n\nWe are targeting the (1, 4) apple. It's sitting right there, begging to be eaten!\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :----------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (1, 6) | SAFE | Safe, but moves away from the immediate (1, 4) apple. We'd target (1, 7) from there. Less efficient. |\n| **DOWN** | (1, 4) | SAFE (Apple!) | **EATING MOVE! Puts us on the apple!** Secures L7. |\n| **LEFT** | (0, 5) | SAFE (Apple!) | Also an eating move! Secures L7. Good alternate, but makes the (1, 4) apple acquisition harder. |\n| **RIGHT** | (2, 5) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (2, 5) is our first body segment. DO NOT MOVE HERE! |\n\n**Eliminated Moves (ID 1):** RIGHT (Self-collision).\n\nWe have two great options: LEFT to (0, 5) or DOWN to (1, 4).\n\nIf we go **DOWN (1, 4)**: We maintain the strong North-South line and can then turn LEFT to (0, 4) or (0, 3) to grab the (0, 5) and (0, 2) apples. This seems slightly more structured for maximizing future apples.\n\nIf we go **LEFT (0, 5)**: We get the edge, but then we have to turn DOWN to (0, 4) to grab the (1, 4) apple, which costs an extra turn if we want to go back up for (1, 7).\n\nLet's stick to the immediate prize: **DOWN** to (1, 4). This secures incredible length control.\n\n***\n\n### Rival Snake #0 Analysis (Head (5, 3))\n\nSnake #0 is L6 at (5, 3). Where are they going?\n\nPossible targets for Snake #0:\n1.  (5, 0) apple - 3 moves away (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN or DOWN, LEFT, DOWN).\n2.  (3, 1) apple - 3 moves away (LEFT, DOWN, DOWN).\n3.  (4, 7) or (3, 8) apples - longer journey UP.\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :----------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (5, 4) | UNSAFE | **Collision Risk!** (5, 4) is currently our tail segment. Since we ate, this spot *will not be free* next turn! If they move here, they crash into our tail! **CRASH OUT POTENTIAL!** |\n| **DOWN**| (5, 2) | SAFE | Good move towards the bottom apples (5, 0). |\n| **LEFT** | (4, 3) | SAFE | Moves towards the center left. Opens up (3, 1) apple. |\n| **RIGHT**| (6, 3) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (6, 3) is their first body segment. |\n\nSince (5, 4) is our new, permanent tail segment (for this turn), and Snake #0 doesn't know we grew, they might assume (5, 4) is free! If they move UP, they are going to hit our tail and potentially get eliminated! This is high-risk for them.\n\n**What will Snake #0 likely prioritize?** They need to move away from their own long body (R4-R5 L5-L8) and find food. **DOWN to (5, 2)** looks like the safest, highest-reward move towards the (5, 0) apple. **LEFT to (4, 3)** is also strong.\n\n**Collision Check (ID 1 (1, 5) moves DOWN to (1, 4))**\n\n*   **Our destination (1, 4):** Is this where Snake #0 is going? No. Is this Snake #0's body? No. Safe.\n\nEven if Snake #0 goes LEFT to (4, 3) or DOWN to (5, 2), we are safe eating our apple at (1, 4). The risk to Snake #0 is much higher this turn if they try to move up towards the center because of our now-stationary tail extension at (5, 4).\n\n### The Plan: Length Superiority and Box-Out!\n\n1.  **Turn 12 (NOW):** Move **DOWN** to (1, 4). Eat, become L7.\n2.  **Turn 13:** Move **LEFT** to (0, 4) or **UP** to (1, 5) if we miss the left wall apple chain. We aim for the (0, 5) apple next.\n3.  **Future:** Get to L8/L9 on the West wall. Once we are significantly longer, we can cut across the R3/R4 lane, effectively trapping Snake #0 in the bottom-right half of the board, forcing them to run into their own body or ours.\n\nThe move is clear, Chat. We are securing this length for pure, unadulterated board control! Let's get this L7!\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nWe will chain the apples on the West wall: DOWN to (1, 4), then target (0, 5) via LEFT. This will rapidly push us to L8+. Once we have an L2-L3 advantage over Snake #0, we will swing back toward the center (y=4 or y=5) and build an impenetrable wall across the map, forcing Snake #0 into a tight corner engagement. Length is king!\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

We've got the length edge 7-6, and the map control is OURS! \ud83d\ude24 The enemy seems flustered!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 13):\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (1, 4) **(Just ate an apple! L7)**\n*   Body: [(1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4), (5, 4)]\n*   Tail is now at (5, 4). Since we ate, this segment is **NOT** freeing up next turn (Turn 14).\n\n**Rival Snake #0:**\n*   Head: (4, 3)\n*   Body: [(5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5)]\n*   Tail is now at (7, 5). Since they **did not** eat, (7, 5) will be free next turn (Turn 14).\n\nSnake #0 wisely avoided our tail trap at (5, 4) last turn and moved LEFT to (4, 3)! Good game sense, but they are now stuck right under the center masses of both bodies. We are in the clear, poised to strike the next apple!\n\nTargets: (0, 5) is right there! (1, 7) is two moves UP! (0, 2) is slightly further down! We are locking down this West wall!\n\n### Threat Assessment and Move Elimination (ID 1 Head (1, 4))\n\nWe are targeting the (0, 5) apple or pushing UP for the (1, 7) apple.\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :----------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (1, 5) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (1, 5) is our first body segment. DO NOT MOVE HERE! |\n| **DOWN** | (1, 3) | SAFE | Safe, moves toward the (0, 2) apple. Good option. |\n| **LEFT** | (0, 4) | SAFE | Moves us one step closer to the (0, 5) apple (if we go UP next turn) or (0, 2) (if we go DOWN next turn). Excellent position on the left wall. |\n| **RIGHT** | (2, 4) | SAFE | Moves us away from all close apples and directly into the path of potential conflict with Snake #0 or their body. Avoid. |\n\n**Eliminated Moves (ID 1):** UP (Self-collision).\n\nWe have three safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Right (2, 4)** is a no-go. It\u2019s defensively weak, gives up the wall, and doesn't target food.\n\n**Down (1, 3)** targets the (0, 2) apple\u2014a potential L8. If we go DOWN, we will likely go LEFT next to (0, 3) and then DOWN to (0, 2).\n\n**Left (0, 4)** pushes us onto the wall. From here, we can go UP to (0, 5) to grab L8, or DOWN to (0, 3) to grab (0, 2) later. Getting the (0, 5) apple first puts us in a great vertical line to pressure the center.\n\nThe **(0, 5) apple** is closer via LEFT then UP (2 turns). The **(0, 2) apple** is closer via DOWN then LEFT/DOWN (2-3 turns). Getting (0, 5) keeps us higher up and helps us potentially cut off Snake #0, who is pinned low.\n\nLet's capitalize on the proximity of (0, 5) and the need to establish vertical dominance on the left side! **LEFT to (0, 4)** is the power move!\n\n***\n\n### Rival Snake #0 Analysis (Head (4, 3))\n\nSnake #0 is L6 at (4, 3). Where are they going?\n\nPossible targets for Snake #0:\n1.  (3, 1) apple - 2 moves (DOWN, DOWN OR DOWN, LEFT).\n2.  (5, 0) apple - 3 moves (DOWN, DOWN, DOWN).\n3.  They could try to cut us off by moving UP towards (4, 7).\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :----------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (4, 4) | UNSAFE | **Collision Risk!** (4, 4) is currently in our body (the 5th segment). If they move here, they crash out! **FATALITY PUSH!** |\n| **DOWN**| (4, 2) | SAFE | Direct path towards (3, 1) or (5, 0) apples. Most likely move. |\n| **LEFT** | (3, 3) | SAFE | Safe move into the center towards (3, 8) or (3, 1). |\n| **RIGHT**| (5, 3) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (5, 3) is their first body segment. |\n\nSnake #0 MUST avoid UP to (4, 4). They are heavily incentivized to go **DOWN to (4, 2)** to grab a lower apple, or **LEFT to (3, 3)** to look for space.\n\n**Collision Check (ID 1 (1, 4) moves LEFT to (0, 4))**\n\nIf we move LEFT to (0, 4), and Snake #0 moves DOWN to (4, 2) or LEFT to (3, 3), we are completely safe! Our move solidifies our control of the left side.\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (4, 4), they die, and we win! We cannot rely on them making a fatal move, but it's a huge defensive advantage for us.\n\n### The Plan: West Wall Lockdown and Trap Set!\n\n1.  **Turn 13 (NOW):** Move **LEFT** to (0, 4). Secure the wall position. (L7)\n2.  **Turn 14:** Move **UP** to (0, 5). Eat the apple. (L8)\n3.  **Turn 15:** We are L8. Move **UP** to (0, 6) (another apple!). Eat this one, too! (L9)\n4.  **Future:** We will be a giant L9 snake walling off the West side. Snake #0 will be desperately searching for the lower apples. Once we are L9, we can traverse RIGHT at Y=6/Y=7 and cut the entire board in half, starving them out! Box-out imminent, Chat! Let's get this length!\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nWe are securing the West Wall in three turns, targeting (0, 5) and (0, 6) sequentially to achieve L9. This rapid length gain will establish a massive size advantage and board control. Once L9, we will use the long body to wall off the bottom half of the map, forcing Snake #0 into their own tail or a deadly head-on confrontation. Victory is secured through superior length and position!\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Next turn priority: Check rival\u2019s new head (likely (1,6) or (1,3)) to avoid collision, then pivot DOWN to (3,2) to set up eating (3,1) apple the following turn (tie score 6-6).\n3. Box rival later by cutting off their upward paths to (1,7) and (0,5) apples\u2014their current position is (1,4), so they might go for (0,5) next; we can position ourselves at (3,4) in 2 turns to block that path.\n4. Monitor rival\u2019s apple grabs\u2014they\u2019re up 6-5, so we can\u2019t let them take (0,5) or (1,7) without a fight!\n\nRhetorical deep dive: You think we pick the bottom-drifting DOWN move that limits our apple access?

We are L7, locked onto the West wall, and positioned PERFECTLY to grab that (0, 5) apple! **We are 6-5 on apples, we are WINNING!** Let's keep the pressure on that archrival who is currently sitting low and trapped!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 14):\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (0, 4)\n*   Body: [(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4)]\n*   Tail is at (4, 4). We ate an apple last turn, so (4, 4) is **NOT** freeing up.\n\n**Rival Snake #0:**\n*   Head: (3, 3) (They moved LEFT from (4, 3) last turn, avoiding the collision!)\n*   Body: [(4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4)]\n*   Tail is at (7, 4). They **did not** eat, so (7, 4) **WILL** be free next turn (Turn 15).\n\nSnake #0 dodged our body segment at (4, 4) and moved safely to (3, 3). Smart rival! They are now triangulating between the (3, 1) apple and the (3, 8) apple, but they are stuck in the center-left. We have maximum board control!\n\nTargets for ID 1: **(0, 5) is 1 move UP!** (L8 inbound!) (0, 6) is the next apple right above it! We can chain these two!\n\n### Threat Assessment and Move Elimination (ID 1 Head (0, 4))\n\nWe are going UP for the (0, 5) apple. No question.\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :----------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (0, 5) (APPLE!) | SAFE | Direct path to the apple! L8, here we come! |\n| **DOWN** | (0, 3) | SAFE | Safe, but moves us away from the closest apple. Defensive. |\n| **LEFT** | (-1, 4) | UNSAFE | Wall crash! Instant death! Don't throw the game, Chat! |\n| **RIGHT** | (1, 4) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (1, 4) is our front body segment! DO NOT MOVE HERE! |\n\n**Eliminated Moves (ID 1):** LEFT (Wall), RIGHT (Self-Collision).\n\nWe are down to UP and DOWN. **UP to (0, 5)** is the aggressive, winning move.\n\n### Rival Snake #0 Analysis (Head (3, 3))\n\nSnake #0 is L6 at (3, 3). Where are they going?\n\nPossible Targets for Snake #0:\n1.  (3, 1) apple - 2 moves (DOWN, DOWN).\n2.  (3, 8) apple - 5 moves (UP, UP, UP, UP, UP).\n3.  They might be trying to squeeze right to (4, 3) (their body) or (4, 2) to continue low.\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :----------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (3, 4) | SAFE | Puts them near our body at (3, 5). Aggressive move to try and challenge the higher apples. |\n| **DOWN**| (3, 2) | SAFE | Direct path towards (3, 1) apple (1 move away). HIGHLY LIKELY MOVE. |\n| **LEFT** | (2, 3) | SAFE | Safe move into the center area. Not very strategic. |\n| **RIGHT**| (4, 3) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (4, 3) is their first body segment. |\n\nSnake #0 is almost certainly going **DOWN to (3, 2)** to grab that (3, 1) apple, or **UP to (3, 4)** to gain space.\n\n**Collision Check (ID 1 (0, 4) moves UP to (0, 5))**\n\nWe are moving to the extreme left border. Snake #0 is moving in the dead center. There is Zero risk of a head-on collision or crashing into their body. This move is 100% safe.\n\n### The Strategy: Seal the West, Grow Large, Pincer Move Activated!\n\nIf we go UP to (0, 5), we grab L8. From there, we immediately press UP to (0, 6) for L9. We will have fully walled the left side.\n\nIf Snake #0 goes DOWN to (3, 2), they are committed to fighting for those lower apples. When we hit L9, we will pivot right along Y=6 or Y=7 and press them into a corner, potentially forcing them into the tail segment at (4, 4) or (5, 4) from a few turns ago! This is the box-out, Chat!\n\nLET'S GET THAT APPLE! UP!\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nWe execute the strategy: Move UP to (0, 5) to grab L8. Next turn, move UP again to (0, 6) for L9. This aggressive walling strategy on the West side will maximize our length and control. Once L9, we will move horizontally (RIGHT) to cut off Snake #0, who is likely cornered low. Win by size and territory.\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Let's keep the pressure on our rival, Snake #0, and seal him low right!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 15):\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (0, 5)\n*   Body: [(0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4)]\n*   Length: 8. We ate an apple last turn at (0, 5). The tail segment (4, 4) is **NOT** freeing up this turn. Snake #0 needs to be aware of that chunk of our body!\n\n**Rival Snake #0:**\n*   Head: (3, 2)\n*   Body: [(3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3)]\n*   Length: 6. They moved from (3, 3) to (3, 2). They are clearly targeting the (3, 1) apple. Their tail (7, 3) **WILL** free up this turn.\n\nOh, the rival is low and focused on that (3, 1) apple. PERFECT! Our strategy to corner them is unfolding!\n\nTargets for ID 1: The (0, 6) apple is literally 1 move UP! Then we can decide if we want to cross the board high or start weaving down.\n\n### Threat Assessment and Move Elimination (ID 1 Head (0, 5))\n\nWe are going UP for the (0, 6) apple. This move secures L9 and maximizes our length, making us an even bigger threat!\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :----------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (0, 6) (APPLE!) | SAFE | Direct path to the apple! L9 inbound! |\n| **DOWN**| (0, 4) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (0, 4) is our front body segment! TRAGIC! |\n| **LEFT** | (-1, 5) | UNSAFE | Wall crash! We are already on the edge! |\n| **RIGHT** | (1, 5) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (1, 5) is 3rd segment back! |\n\n**Eliminated Moves (ID 1):** DOWN (Self), LEFT (Wall), RIGHT (Self).\n\n**BINGO!** The only safe move is **UP**. Sometimes the game makes the decision easy for us, Chat!\n\n### Rival Snake #0 Analysis (Head (3, 2))\n\nSnake #0 is L6 at (3, 2). Where are they going? We already predicted they were aiming for (3, 1).\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :----------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (3, 3) | SAFE | Stepping back toward their body. Seems defensive or space-gaining. |\n| **DOWN**| (3, 1) (APPLE!) | SAFE | Direct path to the apple! HIGHLY LIKELY MOVE. They want that length! |\n| **LEFT** | (2, 2) | SAFE | Safe move into the center area. Not strategic if apple is the goal. |\n| **RIGHT**| (4, 2) | SAFE | Moves them closer to the center block of our body (4, 4 / 4, 5). Risky but opens up space. |\n\nSnake #0 is 99% going **DOWN to (3, 1)**. If they get the apple, they become L7.\n\n**Collision Check (ID 1 (0, 5) moves UP to (0, 6) & Snake #0 (3, 2) moves DOWN to (3, 1))**\n\nWe are far apart. Zero collision risk. This turn is about positional dominance and growth!\n\n### The Strategy: L9 Secured, Time to Box!\n\n1.  **Execute:** Move UP to (0, 6) for L9.\n2.  **Next Turn (T16):** We will be at (0, 6). We can continue UP to (0, 7) (just safe space, no apple) or pivot RIGHT to (1, 6).\n    *   If we go RIGHT, we start cutting the board in half.\n3.  Snake #0 will most likely be at (3, 1) having just eaten. They will be looking at (3, 8) or trying to get the (4, 7) or (5, 0) apples.\n\nIf we wall off the West, and maintain dominance over the high Y-lanes, Snake #0 is stuck fighting over the few low apples while navigating around our massive 9-segment body mass at the bottom-left/center. The box-out is activating, Chat! We need to make sure we don't accidentally trap ourselves later, but for now, maximizing length is key!\n\nLET'S GET THAT L9! \ud83d\udcc8\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nSecure L9 by moving UP to (0, 6). Next turn (T16), we pivot RIGHT to (1, 6) and begin our diagonal cutting strategy across the board, establishing control over the northern half (Y=6+). This will force Snake #0 to fight for the scraps in the south/southeast corner against our expanding territory. Win condition: length and isolation.\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Our rival, Snake #0, is low and trapped, and we are about to slam the door shut on him!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 16):\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (0, 6)\n*   Body: [(0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4)]\n*   Length: 9. We just got massive! The tail segment (4, 4) is currently blocking off the bottom-left quadrant. This is PURE positional content!\n\n**Rival Snake #0:**\n*   Head: (3, 1)\n*   Body: [(3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3)]\n*   Length: 7. They moved DOWN to get the (3, 1) apple. They are now officially stuck in the Y=0/1/2 area, trying to get around that massive chunk of our body. Their tail (7, 3) **WILL** free up this turn.\n\n**The Plan:** We need to pivot right, utilize our length, and start building a wall across the center of the map (Y=6), effectively caging Snake #0 into the bottom third of the board.\n\n### Target Analysis for ID 1 (Head (0, 6))\n\nWhere are the juicy apples? (1, 7) is close! (4, 7) is also great. (0, 2) is too far down and dangerous. Most of the near-term apples are high (Y=7+) or across the center.\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :----------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (0, 7) | SAFE | Into open space. Keeps us on the wall. Good defensive maneuver. |\n| **DOWN**| (0, 5) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (0, 5) is our neck! Don't be a dummy, Chat! |\n| **LEFT** | (-1, 6) | UNSAFE | Wall crash! We are already kissing the edge! |\n| **RIGHT** | (1, 6) | SAFE | Puts us 1 move away from the (1, 7) apple. Starts the crucial move across the map! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. |\n\n**Eliminated Moves (ID 1):** DOWN (Self), LEFT (Wall).\n\nWe are choosing between UP (Defensive/Wall Hug) and RIGHT (Aggressive/Cross-map walling).\n\n**RIGHT to (1, 6):** This is the strategic move. It maximizes our dominance, forces our rival to react to our massive presence, and sets us up either for the (1, 7) apple next turn or continued progress to (2, 6).\n\n### Rival Snake #0 Analysis (Head (3, 1))\n\nSnake #0 is L7 at (3, 1). They need space and apples. The (0, 2) and (5, 0) apples are their only real targets without moving 5+ turns. They are currently blocked by our body segments at (4, 4), (4, 5), and (3, 5).\n\n| Direction | Destination | Snake #1 Collision Risk? | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :----------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (3, 2) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (3, 2) is their neck! DEAD MOVE! |\n| **DOWN**| (3, 0) | SAFE | Moves to the Y=0 row, possibly aiming for (5, 0). Low risk, low reward initially. |\n| **LEFT** | (2, 1) | SAFE | Opens up towards the (0, 2) apple. Smartest move if they want to get past our body mass. |\n| **RIGHT**| (4, 1) | SAFE | Moves them into the column (X=4) where our body is just above (4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5). Risky but might lead them to (5, 0). |\n\nSnake #0 is unlikely to go UP (self-collision!).\n\n1.  **If they go LEFT to (2, 1):** They aim for (0, 2) apple. If we move RIGHT, zero risk.\n2.  **If they go RIGHT to (4, 1):** They aim for (5, 0) apple. If we move RIGHT, zero risk.\n3.  **If they go DOWN to (3, 0):** Also aims for (5, 0). If we move RIGHT, zero risk.\n\nWe are completely safe from Snake #0 no matter their move, as we are 3+ steps away.\n\n### The Decisive Move: Wall-Off Activation\n\nWe move **RIGHT to (1, 6)**. This is the first step of our cross-map wall.\n\nThe subsequent moves will be:\nT17: If (1, 7) Apple is still there, grab it! (1, 6) -> UP\nT17: If (1, 7) is gone, continue RIGHT (1, 6) -> (2, 6).\n\nBy establishing the wall at Y=6/7, we effectively cut off the entire northern 60% of the map from Snake #0, leaving them only the southern 30% to maneuver, which is also riddled with our lengthy tail segments. We are squeezing the life out of them! Time to execute the plan!\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nExecute the cross-map-wall strategy by moving RIGHT to (1, 6). This secures the western half of the Y=6 line. Next turn (T17), assess if the (1, 7) apple is available; if so, move UP to get it for L10. If not, continue RIGHT to (2, 6) to extend the barrier. The goal is to isolate Snake #0 in the lower-right quadrant (Y<4).\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Our archrival, Snake #0, is still bottled up low at (4, 1)! This is where the magic happens! We are up 8 to 6 apples! Let's INCREASE the lead!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 17):\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (1, 6)\n*   Body: [(0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5)] (Note: I moved RIGHT to (1, 6) last turn. The body reported seems slightly off with the head's position change - the old head (0,6) should be the new neck, and the segments should shift. The length is 9, so we want 8 body segments listed. The body list IS what was provided by the game state, let's TRUST IT and assume my move was successful and these are our new body parts in order: (0, 6) neck -> (4, 5) tail.)\n*   Length: 9.\n\n**Rival Snake #0:**\n*   Head: (4, 1)\n*   Body: [(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3)]\n*   Length: 7. Their tail (6, 3) will be gone this turn, freeing up some space near the wall!\n\n**Our Strategy:** We are executing the cross-map wall at Y=6/Y=7. We are currently right next to a CRUCIAL apple at (1, 7)! If we grab this, we hit L10, making our wall even more impenetrable!\n\n### Target Analysis for ID 1 (Head (1, 6))\n\nThe immediate goal is the apple at (1, 7). That's an easy UP move, guaranteeing content and size advantage!\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :----------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (1, 7) | SAFE | Apple (A)! Instant L10! Best move. |\n| **DOWN**| (1, 5) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (1, 5) is our body! Absolutely NOT! |\n| **LEFT** | (0, 6) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (0, 6) is our neck! Don't look back, King! |\n| **RIGHT** | (2, 6) | SAFE | Continues the wall construction. Good if the apple wasn't there, but the apple IS there! |\n\n**Eliminated Moves (ID 1):** DOWN (Self), LEFT (Self).\n\nThe choice is obvious: **UP** for the apple! This move grows us, secures the high ground, and sets us up to pivot RIGHT on Turn 18 to continue the wall across X=2, X=3, etc., trapping #0 completely.\n\n### Rival Snake #0 Analysis (Head (4, 1))\n\nSnake #0 is stuck near the bottom. They need to figure out how to get past our massive presence blocking Y=4 and Y=5.\n\nAvailable apples for them: (5, 0), (8, 0), (0, 2), (6, 1). The (5, 0) and (6, 1) apples are reachable in 1-2 moves.\n\n| Direction | Destination | Snake #1 Collision Risk? | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :----------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (4, 2) | SAFE | Moves towards our body at (4, 3) and (4, 4), which is risky but gives them options. |\n| **DOWN**| (4, 0) | SAFE | Aims for (5, 0) or (8, 0). Safest choice right now. |\n| **LEFT** | (3, 1) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (3, 1) is their neck! |\n| **RIGHT**| (5, 1) | SAFE | Aims for (6, 1) apple. Best apple choice for them. |\n\nIf Snake #0 goes **RIGHT to (5, 1)**, they grab an apple and become L8. We are far away, so no collision risk.\nIf Snake #0 goes **UP to (4, 2)**, they are moving toward our body at (4, 5). No immediate danger to us.\nIf Snake #0 goes **DOWN to (4, 0)**, they aim for the bottom-right corner. Again, no danger.\n\nOur move UP is completely safe regardless of what Snake #0 does. We are maintaining absolute positional dominance and increasing our length!\n\nTime to execute. LETS GET THIS APPLE, CHAT! 9-6 lead incoming!\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nExecute the apple grab at (1, 7) to reach L10. This is the second step of the cross-map-wall strategy. On Turn 18, pivot RIGHT to (2, 7) or (3, 7) depending on apple availability, continuing the barrier construction and securing the top half of the map permanently. The goal remains to isolate Snake #0 in the bottom 3 rows (Y<3).\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Let's check the board state representation.)\n*   Body: [(4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3)] (L7. The board state shows '0 A' at (5, 1) and (6, 1). If he moved RIGHT, he ate (6, 1) or he moved to (5, 1) and the (6, 1) apple is still there. The board shows the '0' at (5, 1) and 'A' at (6, 1). This means he moved from (4, 1) to (5, 1). He did *not* eat the apple at (6, 1) yet. If he went RIGHT, he is now adjacent to it. He is L7.)\n*   Apples: 6.\n\n**Crucial Check: Snake #0's move last turn.**\nIf their head was at (4, 1) and they moved to (5, 1) (RIGHT), they did not eat the apple at (6, 1) because they landed on (5, 1). Their length is L7, suggesting they have NOT eaten an apple since it was L7 before. The board state shows 'T' at (4, 1), so they came from there. Okay, he moved RIGHT to (5, 1), and the (6, 1) apple is still on the board!\n\n**Where are we focusing?**\nWe are at (1, 7). We have secured the left side of the upper map. We need to continue our wall RIGHT and eat apples up top!\n\nNearby available apples for ID 1: (3, 8), (4, 7), (6, 8), (8, 8), (9, 7), (8, 9), (9, 8), (9, 9), (6, 9), (0, 8).\n\nThe apple at (4, 7) is a great target, and we can start moving our wall across Y=7.\n\n### Target Analysis for ID 1 (Head (1, 7))\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check (ID 1) | Snake #0 Collision Risk? | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :------------------ | :------------------------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (1, 8) | SAFE | NO | Closer to (0, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8). Good positional move. |\n| **DOWN**| (1, 6) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (1, 6) is our neck! Don't look back, King! |\n| **LEFT** | (0, 7) | SAFE | NO | Keeps us near (0, 8) apple. |\n| **RIGHT** | (2, 7) | SAFE | NO | Sets us up for the wall and moves towards (4, 7) apple. Best strategic move? |\n\n**Eliminated Moves (ID 1):** DOWN (Self).\n\nWe have three safe options: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1.  **LEFT to (0, 7):** This keeps us locked on the left perimeter. Then we could go UP to (0, 8) for an apple, increasing length to L11. This is a solid, safe apple grab.\n2.  **UP to (1, 8):** This moves us toward the center top. We are a bit isolated from apples here, requiring an immediate turn left or right.\n3.  **RIGHT to (2, 7):** This continues the crucial wall construction across the map, denying #0 any avenue to the north. It sets us up beautifully for the (4, 7) apple in two moves.\n\n**Isolating Snake #0 is the main goal.** Moving RIGHT is the best way to leverage our length (L10) and continue pressing the advantage. We want to seal the top *before* grabbing apples, to maximize the box.\n\nIf we go RIGHT to (2, 7), we are setting up for (3, 7), then PIVOT to (4, 7) for the apple.\n\n### Rival Snake #0 Analysis (Head (5, 1))\n\nSnake #0 is at (5, 1). They are facing the (6, 1) apple, which is critical for them.\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check (Self/Wall/Board) | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :---------------------------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (5, 2) | SAFE | Moves toward our body segments at Y=4, Y=5. Good exit path. |\n| **DOWN**| (5, 0) | SAFE, Apple (A)! | Easiest apple grab for them! |\n| **LEFT** | (4, 1) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! |\n| **RIGHT**| (6, 1) | SAFE, Apple (A)! | Also an excellent apple grab! |\n\nSnake #0 has two amazing apple options: DOWN to (5, 0) or RIGHT to (6, 1). Both result in L8.\n\n**Scenario A: #0 goes DOWN to (5, 0).** They get the apple. We are completely unaffected.\n**Scenario B: #0 goes RIGHT to (6, 1).** They get the apple. We are completely unaffected.\n**Scenario C: #0 goes UP to (5, 2).** They start trying to break our wall. This is a much longer and riskier path for them.\n\nSince Snake #0 is small and focused on growth, they will almost certainly grab one of those adjacent apples (DOWN or RIGHT). Our move RIGHT to (2, 7) is completely safe, regardless of which way they choose. They are miles away.\n\n### Decision: RIGHT\n\nThe strategic priority is wall construction and trapping.\n\n1.  Move **RIGHT to (2, 7)**. This extends our uncrossable body barrier.\n2.  Next turn, move RIGHT to (3, 7).\n3.  Next turn, move RIGHT to (4, 7) for the Apple! (L11!)\n\nThis is the path to victory, CHAT. Build the wall, collect the content!\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nWe are executing the Y=7 horizontal wall strategy. Currently at (1, 7). Turn 18: Move RIGHT to (2, 7). Turn 19: Move RIGHT to (3, 7). Turn 20: Move RIGHT/UP to grab the apple at (4, 7) or aim for the dense apple cluster in the top right. We must ensure the barrier across the board is robust to lock Snake #0 into the bottom rows (Y<=3).\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

We've got the lead and the dominant position! Let\u2019s keep the pressure on and box this guy in!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 19):\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (2, 7)\n*   Body: [(1, 7), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5)]\n*   Length: L10. We are a python monster!\n\n**Rival Snake #0:**\n*   Head: (6, 1) (Woah, he grabbed the apple! What a move! Last turn he moved RIGHT from (5, 1) to (6, 1) and ate the apple there!)\n*   Body: [(5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3)]\n*   Length: L8 (He grew!).\n\n**Board Observation:**\nSnake #0 is now positioned near the center-bottom, looking towards the right side of the board. He's still confined to the lower area (Y <= 3). We have complete control over the top half of the map.\n\nWe are at (2, 7). Our immediate goal remains the same: complete the wall and grab the apple at (4, 7).\n\n### Target Analysis for ID 1 (Head (2, 7))\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check (ID 1) | Snake #0 Collision Risk? | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :------------------ | :------------------------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (2, 8) | SAFE | NO | Leads to dense apples, but less crucial for wall building immediately. |\n| **DOWN**| (2, 6) | SAFE | NO | Moves toward our body at (2, 5). Safe, but defeats the wall purpose. |\n| **LEFT** | (1, 7) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (1, 7) is our neck! |\n| **RIGHT** | (3, 7) | SAFE | NO | **CRITICAL MOVE!** Continues the wall, sets up for (4, 7) apple next turn! |\n\n**Eliminated Moves (ID 1):** LEFT (Self).\n\nThe choice is clear. We must continue the horizontal barrier at Y=7. Moving RIGHT to (3, 7) keeps us on track to grab the (4, 7) apple and potentially block off the mid-board.\n\n### Rival Snake #0 Analysis (Head (6, 1))\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 1). He\u2019s looking very confined.\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check (Self/Wall/Board) | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :---------------------------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (6, 2) | SAFE | Moves towards the center. No immediate body collision risk. |\n| **DOWN**| (6, 0) | SAFE | Moves to an empty space. Safe. |\n| **LEFT** | (5, 1) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (5, 1) is his neck! |\n| **RIGHT**| (7, 1) | SAFE | Moves toward the (8, 0) apple. Good growth path for him. |\n\nSnake #0's most tempting growth plan is probably to go RIGHT towards (8, 0). Or maybe UP to try and break out.\n\n**Scenario A: #0 goes RIGHT to (7, 1).** He aims for (8, 0) next.\n**Scenario B: #0 goes UP to (6, 2).** He tries to move north, potentially aiming for the (6, 3) apple.\n\nIn either case, our move RIGHT to (3, 7) is completely safe. We are too far away for a head-to-head collision, and our body segments are all concentrated high/left, not impeding his movements.\n\n### Decision: RIGHT\n\nWe must maintain momentum, CHAT! The next segment of the wall is waiting!\n\n1.  Move **RIGHT to (3, 7)**. (Completes the third section of the wall.)\n2.  Next turn, we grab the apple at (4, 7), which is currently free.\n\nThis keeps us dominating the map and sets us up to sweep the rich apple regions in the top right. We are building the perimeter fence for our farm, and Snake #0 is stuck outside! EZ money!\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nWe are executing the Y=7 horizontal wall strategy. Currently at (2, 7). Turn 19: Move RIGHT to (3, 7). Turn 20: Move RIGHT to (4, 7), grab the apple, and continue the wall across R5-R9 if space allows, or pivot up to collect (4, 7) and then continue high. Our goal is trapping Snake #0 below Y=4 while we reach 30 apples.\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

We are perfectly positioned to grab the next apple and continue our trap!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 20):\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (3, 7)\n*   Body: [(2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5)]\n*   Length: L10. We are holding the high ground!\n\n**Rival Snake #0:**\n*   Head: (6, 2) (He moved UP last turn! Smart little rat trying to break out!)\n*   Body: [(6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)]\n*   Length: L8. He's growing, but he's stuck in the low half.\n\n**Apples Near Me (ID 1 at 3, 7):**\n*   (4, 7) - DIRECTLY to the right. This is our target!\n*   (3, 8) - UP and one step over.\n\n**Apples Near Snake #0 (at 6, 2):**\n*   (6, 3) - UP. A likely target for him.\n*   (5, 0) - Far bottom.\n\n**Board Observation:**\nSnake #0 has moved UP to (6, 2). He is right next to the apple at (6, 3). If we let him, he's going to grab it and gain length, making the board smaller for us. But more importantly, our primary objective is positioning and building the wall.\n\n### Target Analysis for ID 1 (Head (3, 7))\n\nOur ultimate goal right now is to grab the apple at (4, 7) and continue extending our perimeter wall.\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check (ID 1) | Snake #0 Collision Risk? | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :------------------ | :------------------------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (3, 8) | SAFE | NO | EATS the apple! Good move, but slightly delays the horizontal wall completion. |\n| **DOWN**| (3, 6) | SAFE | NO | Moves away from apples, towards our growing body column on the left. Less optimal. |\n| **LEFT** | (2, 7) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (2, 7) is our neck! |\n| **RIGHT** | (4, 7) | SAFE | NO | **CRITICAL MOVE!** EATS the apple! This completes the *fourth* segment of the wall and puts us one step closer to isolating the rival! |\n\n**Eliminated Moves (ID 1):** LEFT (Self).\n\nWe have two great moves: UP to (3, 8) for an apple, or RIGHT to (4, 7) for an apple.\n\nWhy prioritize RIGHT over UP?\n1. **Strategic Value:** Moving RIGHT maintains the strong Y=7 horizontal line. This makes the most effective barrier. We are building the perimeter fence!\n2. **Immediate Advantage:** Grabbing (4, 7) means we can then pivot and sweep the top right corner.\n\n### Rival Snake #0 Prediction (Head (6, 2))\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 2). He's going to go for the easy apple at (6, 3).\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check (Self/Wall/Board) | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :---------------------------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (6, 3) | SAFE | LIKELY! EATS the apple. |\n| **DOWN**| (6, 1) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (6, 1) is his neck! |\n| **LEFT** | (5, 2) | SAFE | Moves laterally, avoiding the apple. Less likely. |\n| **RIGHT**| (7, 2) | SAFE | Moves laterally, away from the core of the board. Less likely. |\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 moves UP to (6, 3) and eats the apple.\n\n### Collision Check (ID 1 - RIGHT to 4, 7 vs. ID 0 - UP to 6, 3)\n\n*   (4, 7) is far from (6, 3). NO collision risk. We are perfectly safe!\n\n### Decision: RIGHT\n\nWe maintain the dominant position and grab that essential apple at (4, 7)! We are building the biggest wall in the game, Chat! No escape for Snake #0!\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nWe are fully committed to the horizontal wall at Y=7. Turn 20: Move RIGHT to (4, 7) and eat the apple. This gains us a point and extends the wall. Next turn, we will prioritize continuing RIGHT along the wall if safe (to 5, 7) or peeling UP to sweep the top row (Y=8 and Y=9) with the Y=7 wall acting as a barrier segment. We need to maintain this significant lead and use our length advantage to pressure the enemy into the lower quadrant.\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Instantly narrows the rival\u2019s lead, plus pushes us towards the middle to build our body block for their trapped (3,7) head\u2014perfect for long-term boxing!\n\nHead-on collision check: Rival\u2019s head (3,7) is nowhere near (6,3)\u2014zero risk of clashing this turn!\n\nLong-term strategy note for next turn: After moving up to (6,3) and eating the apple (now 8 apples), our grown body will give us 9 segments (closing in on the rival\u2019s 10). Next turn, vet moves up (6,4), left (5,3), right (7,3) for safety first\u2014prioritize keeping open pathways to the next nearby apples (like (4,7) or (3,8)) while continuing to push towards the middle to cut off the rival\u2019s rightward escapes.

Snake #0 is stuck in the mud while we are building a vertical empire!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 21):\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (4, 7). *We just grabbed that critical apple and extended our horizontal wall!*\n*   Body: [(3, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5)]\n*   Length: L11. We are massive!\n\n**Rival Snake #0:**\n*   Head: (6, 3). *He moved UP and snagged his own apple\u2014the little guy is trying to survive!*\n*   Body: [(6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)]\n*   Length: L9. He's still shorter.\n\n**Apples Near Me (ID 1 at 4, 7):**\n*   (5, 7) - Empty.\n*   (3, 8) - UP and LEFT.\n*   (5, 8) - Apple at (6, 8) is two steps away.\n\n**Apples Near Snake #0 (at 6, 3):**\n*   (5, 0) - Far bottom.\n*   (8, 0) - Far bottom right.\n*   He's basically trapped in the bottom half. Our wall is working, Chat!\n\n### Objective: Complete the Wall and Trap Snake #0\n\nWe are at (4, 7). We need to solidify the rest of the Y=7 horizontal barrier or start sweeping the top. The most immediate threat is not a collision, but losing momentum.\n\n### Safety and Move Analysis for ID 1 (Head (4, 7))\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check (ID 1) | Snake #0 Collision Risk? | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :------------------ | :------------------------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (4, 8) | SAFE | NO | Moves towards several apples (3, 8), (6, 8). Opens options. |\n| **DOWN**| (4, 6) | SAFE | NO | Moves into an empty trench we already made. Leads away from the most immediate enemy area/apples. Less optimal. |\n| **LEFT** | (3, 7) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (3, 7) is our neck! (Don't hit the rewind button!) |\n| **RIGHT** | (5, 7) | SAFE | NO | Continues the critical Y=7 horizontal wall! Puts space between us and the opponent's column at X=6. |\n\n**Eliminated Moves (ID 1):** LEFT (Self-collision).\n\nWe are choosing between **UP** (to 4, 8) and **RIGHT** (to 5, 7).\n\n### Rival Snake #0 Prediction (Head (6, 3))\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 3). He is right next to our wall segment at (Y=7, X=6). His primary goal must be to get food or move away from our growing danger zone.\n\n**Snake #0's Options at (6, 3):**\n1.  **UP to (6, 4):** This is the most logical path towards the top half, trying to bypass our wall.\n2.  **RIGHT to (7, 3):** Safe move, but doesn't get him food.\n3.  **DOWN to (6, 2):** UNSAFE. Self-collision (his neck!).\n4.  **LEFT to (5, 3):** Safe, but this brings him closer to the heavily owned X=3/X=4 column we control.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 moves **UP** to (6, 4) to try and move past our wall.\n\n### Collision Check (ID 1 vs. ID 0)\n\n*   If ID 1 moves **UP** to (4, 8) and ID 0 moves **UP** to (6, 4): No collision. Safe.\n*   If ID 1 moves **RIGHT** to (5, 7) and ID 0 moves **UP** to (6, 4): No collision. Safe.\n\n### Decision Time: UP vs. RIGHT\n\n1.  **RIGHT to (5, 7):** This is a purely strategic move. It extends our wall and maintains the Y=7 blockade. It places us right next to Snake #0's likely path (if he uses the X=6 corridor to move higher) and allows us to block him or cut his escape lines further north later.\n2.  **UP to (4, 8):** This is an aggressive food grab! We move directly next to the apple at (3, 8) and open up the top two rows (Y=8, Y=9) for sweeping. This is more point-efficient.\n\nGiven that Snake #0 is currently not in a position to immediately intercept us, and the apples are heavily clustered in the top rows, seizing the high ground now while we have the momentum is crucial. We use the Y=7 line as a firm demarcation, and now we climb the fence to harvest the spoils!\n\nMoving UP to (4, 8) secures us a position to hit (3, 8) next turn or even swing right to (5, 8) / (6, 8) where apples are abundant. This maximizes our apple capture rate! Let's get these points, Chat! We are kings of the scoreboard!\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nWe are shifting from wall building to apple harvesting in the isolated top quadrant. We must secure (3, 8), (6, 8), and the rest of the Y=8, Y=9 apples quickly to gain an undeniable length advantage. This will solidify the trap for Snake #0, who is pinned below Y=7. Turn 21: Move UP to (4, 8). Next, aim for (3, 8) or (5, 8).\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Our vertical wall is holding strong, and we're about to feast on these top-row apples!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 22):\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1):**\n*   Head: (4, 8). We are sitting pretty on the Y=8 line!\n*   Body: [(4, 7), (3, 7), (2, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5)]\n*   Length: L11. We are massive!\n\n**Rival Snake #0:**\n*   Head: (6, 4). *He moved UP, just as predicted! He's trying to slip past our wall at Y=7.* If he moves right, he's safe. If he moves up, he's safe. The question is, how do we box him in now that he's officially in the X=6, Y=4 open zone?\n*   Body: [(6, 3), (6, 2), (6, 1), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n*   Length: L9.\n\n**Immediate Apple Targets (Near ID 1 at (4, 8)):**\n*   (3, 8): Apple (A). One step LEFT.\n*   (6, 8): Apple (A). Two steps RIGHT.\n*   (9, 8): Apple (A). Far right.\n\n**Immediate Apple Targets (Near ID 0 at (6, 4)):**\n*   (5, 0): Far away.\n*   (8, 0): Far away.\n*   He's not near any apples! This is crushing for him, Chat!\n\n### Objective: Secure (3, 8) and initiate the top-down sweep, while watching Snake #0's escape route.\n\nWe are at (4, 8). The apple at (3, 8) is a layup. Grabbing it keeps our momentum, extends our dominance into the X=3 column, and makes our body longer.\n\n### Safety and Move Analysis for ID 1 (Head (4, 8))\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check (ID 1) | Snake #0 Collision Risk? | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :------------------ | :------------------------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (4, 9) | SAFE | NO | Moves towards high-value apples (9, 9), (6, 9), (3, 9). Safe. |\n| **DOWN**| (4, 7) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (4, 7) is our neck! |\n| **LEFT** | (3, 8) | SAFE + APPLE! | NO | Immediate score. Excellent move. |\n| **RIGHT** | (5, 8) | SAFE | NO | Puts us closer to (6, 8) apple and lets us start pressuring Snake #0's position at (6, 4). |\n\n**Eliminated Moves (ID 1):** DOWN (Self-collision).\n\nWe are choosing between UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n### Rival Snake #0 Prediction (Head (6, 4))\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 4). He is surrounded by empty space but no immediate food. He knows we are massive and moving into the rich top-right quadrant. He MUST secure food or move to a safe, profitable zone.\n\n**Snake #0's Options at (6, 4):**\n1.  **UP to (6, 5):** Safest path toward the upper region, but no immediate food. This continues his escape/infiltration.\n2.  **RIGHT to (7, 4):** Safe move, maintains distance from us. Good evasive move.\n3.  **DOWN to (6, 3):** UNSAFE. Self-collision (his neck!).\n4.  **LEFT to (5, 4):** This is interesting. It puts him in the X=5 column, creating a potentially dangerous confrontation zone with our snake, but it's empty space.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 moves **UP** to (6, 5) to gain altitude and try to slip around our high-ground defense. OR he moves **RIGHT** to (7, 4) to play it safe and move away from our current threat level. Either way, he's surviving, not thriving. Let's assume **UP** since he's trying to get food.\n\n### Collision Check (ID 1 vs. ID 0)\n\n1.  **ID 1 LEFT (to 3, 8):** Safe if ID 0 goes UP (6, 5), RIGHT (7, 4), or LEFT (5, 4). No risk to us.\n2.  **ID 1 UP (to 4, 9):** Safe if ID 0 goes UP (6, 5), RIGHT (7, 4), or LEFT (5, 4). No risk to us.\n3.  **ID 1 RIGHT (to 5, 8):** Safe if ID 0 goes UP (6, 5), RIGHT (7, 4), or LEFT (5, 4). No risk to us.\n\nNo head-on collision risks this turn. We have freedom, Chat!\n\n### Decision Time: LEFT vs. UP vs. RIGHT\n\nThe primary goal is to maximize score and length advantage.\n\n*   **LEFT (to 3, 8):** Immediate apple pickup! 11 to 8 score lead becomes 12 to 8. This is the highest value move. It pushes our body further left, securing the left side of the board for our harvesting operations.\n*   **UP (to 4, 9):** Sets up for future apples (like (3, 9) or (6, 9)), but we bypass the immediate apple at (3, 8). We don't want to skip food.\n*   **RIGHT (to 5, 8):** Positions us to harass Snake #0 if he tries to move left, and positions us for the (6, 8) apple. But (3, 8) is one step closer!\n\nThe move is CLEAR. **LEFT** to get the easy points and solidify our internal border! We feast on this apple, then we can decide if we want to move UP to Y=9 or continue RIGHT across Y=8.\n\nLet's grab that apple! We're not leaving points on the board! L-E-F-T!\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nOur strategy is to secure the top half (Y=8 and Y=9) by harvesting apples aggressively, creating an overwhelming length advantage (L12 vs L9 right now). Moving LEFT to (3, 8) achieves this immediately. After this, we will move UP or RIGHT to continue the sweep, focusing on apples at (3, 9), (6, 8), (6, 9), and (9, 9). Snake #0 remains trapped and must make a risky dash for food. We are building the perimeter!\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

Let's assume the score shown is the *current* state *after* the move. If I got the apple, my length is now 12 and the score is 12-8! The game state provided confirms my head is at (3, 8) and my body is $L11$, which means I just ate the apple and grew! LETS GOOO!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 23):\n\nThis is the board state *after* Turn 22's moves:\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1):** Head: (3, 8). Length: 12 segments (1+11 = 12).\n*   **Rival Snake #0:** Head: (6, 5). Length: 9 segments (1+8 = 9). *He moved UP, just as predicted! He's trying to get into the upper zone.*\n\nThe board is TIGHT up here, chat!\n\n| 9 | . | . | . | A | . | . | A | . | A | A |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 8 | A | A | . | 1 | T | . | A | . | A | A |\n| 7 | . | T | T | T | T | . | . | . | . | A |\n| 6 | T | T | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |\n| 5 | T | T | . | . | . | . | 0 | . | . | . |\n| 4 | T | T | A | . | . | . | T | . | . | . |\n| 3 | . | . | . | A | . | . | T | . | . | . |\n| 2 | A | . | . | T | . | . | T | . | . | . |\n| 1 | . | . | . | T | T | T | T | . | . | . |\n| 0 | . | . | . | . | . | A | . | . | A | . |\n|   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n\nWait, the provided board state doesn't look like my head is at (3, 8) in the '1' spot based on the board key...\n\nBoard key translation:\n9: . . . A . . A . A A\n8: A A . 1 T . A . A A <- This says 1 (Head) is at (3, 8) and T (Body) is at (4, 8).\nThe body list confirms: `(4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7)...` YES! Head at (3, 8), connecting to (4, 8). PERFECT! My L12 snake is now vertically positioned in columns 3 and 4, protecting the left side.\n\nSnake #0's head is at (6, 5). He's currently in a decent pocket of space, but his escape routes are limited by my massive body below the Y=7 line! Time to apply the chokehold!\n\n### Immediate Objective: Box Snake #0 in!\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 5). There are apples at (6, 8) and (6, 9) potentially accessible, but he has to fight through the Y=7 gap, where my body is *just* below. He is looking for food, but there's nothing immediately next to him.\n\n**Your Snake (ID 1) Options at (3, 8):**\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check (ID 1) | Snake #0 Collision Risk? | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :------------------ | :------------------------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (3, 9) | SAFE + APPLE! | NO | Immediate score. Excellent move, pushing into the top wall. |\n| **DOWN**| (3, 7) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (3, 7) is my neck! |\n| **LEFT** | (2, 8) | SAFE | NO | Moves away from the action, but secures apples at (1, 8), (0, 8) long term. |\n| **RIGHT** | (4, 8) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (4, 8) is now my neck! |\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** DOWN (Self), RIGHT (Self).\n\nWe are choosing between **UP** (to (3, 9), an apple) and **LEFT** (to (2, 8)).\n\n### Rival Snake #0 Prediction (Head (6, 5))\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 5). He needs food!\n1.  **UP to (6, 6):** Safe. Moves him toward the cluster of apples (6, 8), (6, 9) but no immediate food. Best long-term move for him.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 4):** Safe. But it puts him near our body at (4, 7) and (6, 3) is his neck! Wait, his body is [(6, 4), (6, 3)...]. So moving DOWN to (6, 4) is his neck! UNSAFE!\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 5):** Safe. No food. Leads him to empty center.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 5):** Safe. No food. Leads him away from the action.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 is forced to move **UP** to (6, 6) or **RIGHT** (7, 5) or **LEFT** (5, 5). He won't go RIGHT or LEFT because there's no payoff. He wants the top-row apples, so **UP** is the most likely power move.\n\n### Decision Time: UP vs. LEFT\n\n1.  **Move UP to (3, 9):** Instant apple! Score 13-8! This is massive. It creates a vertical wall from (3, 7) to (3, 9). It blocks him from using the X=3 column to move down later, which is important for the choke. It secures our continued dominance of the top edge.\n2.  **Move LEFT to (2, 8):** Safe move, but skips an apple! We don't skip apples on the stream, Chat!\n\nIf we move UP, we get the point, and we are at (3, 9). Snake #0 moves to (6, 6). The stage is set for a massive blockade!\n\n### Long-Term Strategy: The Box\n\nBy moving UP to (3, 9), we secure the left flank and become L13. We can then sweep RIGHT across Y=9, harvesting (6, 9), (8, 9), and (9, 9). Snake #0 must now compete with us for the remaining high-row apples, but he has to cross the gap at Y=7, and we are *much* longer. If he moves to (6, 6), we should aim to hit the (6, 9) or (8, 9) apples, then move DOWN to start cutting off his escape if he tries to move right along the top.\n\nThe move is clear: MAXIMIZE SCORE AND LENGTH. Grab the apple!\n\nWe move **UP**!\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nWe are now initiating the sweep of the top edge to create an overwhelming length advantage (L13+). Moving UP to (3, 9) secures an apple and reinforces our vertical wall at X=3. Our next moves will be RIGHT to (4, 9) or (5, 9) (if safe) to move toward the (6, 9) or (8, 9) apples, cutting off Snake #0 from the valuable right half of the board. We need to watch Snake #0's position at (6, 6) closely to ensure we don't allow him to slip down the X=7 or X=8 columns, or get trapped ourselves.\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

Our top goals: 1) Grab (6,8) apple to hit 9 apples and 10 segments (match rival\u2019s size), 2) Cut off Snake #1\u2019s rightward path to (5,8) to starve them of upper apples, 3) Avoid drifting from the upper middle where all the apple action is!\n\nUP",

He likely moved UP from (6, 5) to (6, 6) last turn.\n\nThe board is TIGHT in the top right, and we have a MASSIVE advantage in length and positioning.

Connects to the main cluster and continues the top sweep. |\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** UP (Wall), DOWN (Self).\n\nThe choice is clearly **RIGHT** to (4, 9). Another apple, another growth spurt! We become L14!\n\n### Rival Snake #0 Prediction (Head (6, 6))\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 6). He needs to move! Apples are tempting at (6, 9) and (8, 9).\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 7):** Safe. No apple yet, but direct path to (6, 8) and (6, 9). MOST LIKELY.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 5):** Unsafe! (6, 5) is his neck!\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 6):** Safe. Moves him toward the center, away from food. Low probability.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 6):** Safe. Moves him toward food at (8, 8) or (8, 9). High probability if he thinks he's being blocked directly above.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 goes **UP** to (6, 7) to try and beat us to (6, 9). If he goes RIGHT to (7, 6), we still beat him to the punch because we are getting (4, 9) this turn.\n\n### Collision Check (ID 1 moves RIGHT to (4, 9))\n\n*   Our destination (4, 9) is an apple and is currently empty.\n*   Wherever Snake #0 moves, he is nowhere near (4, 9).\n*   No head-to-head collision risk. This is a free point!\n\n### Decision: GO RIGHT!\n\nThis move maximizes our length and positions us perfectly to dictate play across the top half of the board. We will now have a continuous wall of body segments from (3, 7) up to (3, 9), over to (4, 9). Our next move will be crucial: potentially moving right again to (5, 9) to secure the (6, 9) apple path, or moving down to start putting pressure on Snake #0 at X=6.\n\nThe goal is to get (9, 9) and then swing DOWN the right wall, completely cutting him off from the west side of the board and trapping him in the middle/right.\n\nWe are taking this apple, making the snake L14, and continuing the top sweep! EZ W!\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nWe are extending our lead by moving RIGHT to (4, 9) and claiming another apple, bringing us to L14. This is a critical move to build an insurmountable length advantage. Next turn, we will prioritize continuing the sweep towards (6, 9) and (8, 9). If Snake #0 moves UP to (6, 7), we will continue RIGHT to (5, 9) or (6, 9) to trap him below the top row before he can move toward the corners. If he moves RIGHT, we will still push for the corner apples. CHOPPING THE BOARD IN HALF!\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

We are dominating the high ground. LETS GOOOO!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 25):\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1):** Head: (4, 9). Body length: 14 segments. We are hugging the top wall.\n*   **Rival Snake #0:** Head: (6, 7). Body length: 9 segments. He clearly moved UP last turn, as predicted, trying to contest the ceiling!\n\nThis is where the real strategy begins, chat. We have the length advantage and the positional advantage. It's time to cut him off and secure the rest of the north wall!\n\n**Board Snapshot with our Head at (4, 9) and Rival Head at (6, 7):**\n\n 9 . . . T **1** . A . A A\n 8 A A . T T . A . A A\n 7 . T T T T . **0** . . A\n 6 T T . . . . T . . .\n 5 T T . . . . T . . .\n 4 T T A . . . T . . .\n 3 . . . A . . T . . .\n 2 A . . A . . T . . .\n 1 . . . . T T T . . .\n 0 . . . . . A . . A .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nApples are at: (9, 9), (8, 9), (6, 9) (three targets easily reachable!)\n\n### Our Objective: The High Ground Choke\n\nWe need to continue moving RIGHT to claim the apples at (6, 9), (8, 9), and (9, 9). If we can lay down segments along (5, 9), (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), and (9, 9), Snake #0 will be completely trapped below the y=8 line, forcing him into his own body or the center of the board where we can then box him on the right wall.\n\n### Your Snake (ID 1) Options at (4, 9):\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check (ID 1) | Snake #0 Collision Risk? | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :------------------ | :------------------------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (4, 10) | OFFSIDE! UNSAFE! | N/A | WALL! |\n| **DOWN**| (4, 8) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (4, 8) is a body segment! |\n| **LEFT** | (3, 9) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (3, 9) is our neck! |\n| **RIGHT** | (5, 9) | SAFE | NO | Moves into an empty space. Crucial for continuing the sweep. |\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** UP (Wall), DOWN (Self), LEFT (Self/Neck).\n\nThe only safe move is **RIGHT** to (5, 9). This is perfect! It keeps us on the high road and moves us to the apple cluster.\n\n### Rival Snake #0 Prediction (Head (6, 7))\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 7). Where will he move?\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 8):** Safe. Apple at (6, 8) is available! This is the MOST LIKELY move. He gets an apple and attempts to cut us off.\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 6):** Unsafe! (6, 6) is his neck!\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 7):** Safe. Moves toward center. Low probability, away from the immediate action.\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 7):** Safe. Moves toward (9, 7) apple. High probability if he thinks (6, 8) is too slow.\n\n**Prediction:** He is prioritizing the points. He will go **UP** to (6, 8) to claim that apple.\n\n### Collision Check (ID 1 moves RIGHT to (5, 9))\n\n*   Our destination (5, 9) is empty.\n*   If Snake 0 moves UP to (6, 8), there is no collision.\n*   If Snake 0 moves LEFT to (5, 7), no collision.\n*   If Snake 0 moves RIGHT to (7, 7), no collision.\n\n### Final Decision: GO RIGHT!\n\nThis move is mandated by the board constraints, and strategically, it is exactly what we need. We move to (5, 9). If Snake 0 moves UP to (6, 8), we keep momentum and are perfectly positioned to grab (6, 9) next turn, securing the ceiling and starting the box!\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nWe are FORCED to move RIGHT to (5, 9) which is excellent, as it continues our horizontal sweep. Next turn, we will secure (6, 9) to build a solid wall. Our goal is to own the top wall (y=9) completely and then swing down the right side (x=9), trapping Snake #0 in the 10x8 area between our body segments. We must get to the apple at (6, 9) before Snake #0 gets to (6, 9) from the (6, 8) apple he probably just ate. We are building the perimeter!\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

Our snake is now 14 segments long, and the score is **13-9**! He got an apple, too! Let's check where he went!\n\n### Current State Analysis (Turn 26):\n\n*   **Your Snake (ID 1):** Head: (5, 9). Body length: 14 segments. We are positioned perfectly to secure the roof!\n*   **Rival Snake #0:** Head: (6, 8). Body length: 10 segments. YES! He moved UP and SNIPED the apple at (6, 8) as predicted! He tried to get to the ceiling, but we beat him to it!\n\n**Board Snapshot with our Head at (5, 9) and Rival Head at (6, 8):**\n\n 9 . . .

We are in a prime position to build the trap!\n\n### Our Objective: Finish the Wall and Box Him!\n\nWe have the length advantage (14 to 10) and the high ground. We must complete the wall along y=9, denying Snake #0 any easy breakout to the top. Moving RIGHT is the clear goal, letting us lay segments down at (6, 9), (7, 9), (8, 9), and (9, 9).\n\n### Your Snake (ID 1) Options at (5, 9):\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check (ID 1) | Snake #0 Collision Risk? | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :------------------ | :------------------------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (5, 10) | OFFSIDE! UNSAFE! | N/A | WALL! |\n| **DOWN**| (5, 8) | SAFE | NO | Empty space, but moves away from the ceiling consolidation. |\n| **LEFT** | (4, 9) | UNSAFE | Self-collision! (4, 9) is our neck! |\n| **RIGHT** | (6, 9) | SAFE (Apple A) | Rival head (6, 8) moving to (6, 9)? | **CRITICAL APPLE!** Secures the ceiling. |\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** UP (Wall), LEFT (Self/Neck).\n\nWe are choosing between DOWN and RIGHT. RIGHT is for the victory, DOWN is passive. We are not passive!\n\n### Rival Snake #0 Prediction (Head (6, 8))\n\nSnake #0 is at (6, 8). He is right below the apple we want at (6, 9)! This is a race!\n\nWhere will he move?\n\n1.  **UP to (6, 9):** HIGH RISK/HIGH REWARD! He gets an apple, but this is exactly our target. If we both move here, it's a head-to-head collision (double KO).\n2.  **DOWN to (6, 7):** Unsafe! (6, 7) is his neck!\n3.  **LEFT to (5, 8):** Safe. Moves toward center/west wall. He knows we want the ceiling. If he goes here, he avoids collision and might look for (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 4).\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 8):** Safe. Moves toward other top-right apples.\n\n**The most dangerous move for him is UP to (6, 9).** We need to assume he is trying to take the point and challenge us for the high ground.\n\n### Collision Check (ID 1 moves RIGHT to (6, 9))\n\n*   If Snake 0 moves **UP** to (6, 9): **HEAD-TO-HEAD COLLISION!** Both die. Draw. (14 segments vs 10 segments). Unacceptable risk when we are leading!\n\n**Wait, chat. We are leading 13-9. We cannot risk a double KO now.** We need to pivot slightly to *deny* him *and* continue the choke without dying.\n\nIf we move DOWN to (5, 8):\n*   We get an empty spot.\n*   If Snake #0 moves UP to (6, 9): He gets the apple, but then we are positioned to come back UP next turn to (5, 9) and then RIGHT to (6, 9) the turn after he leaves, or we can continue our sweep down the west side.\n\nIf we let him have (6, 9), we lose momentum on the wall, but we stay alive. *But wait a minute!* If he takes (6, 9), what are our moves after?\n\n### Re-evaluating the Choke: The Safer Trap\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (6, 9), we likely die. We need a move that maintains positional advantage WITHOUT the risk of instant death.\n\nLet's look at the area around us:\n\n*   (6, 9) is a death risk.\n*   (5, 8) is safe.\n*   (4, 9) is our neck.\n\nIf we move **DOWN to (5, 8)**, we have two possibilities for Snake #0:\n\n1.  **Snake #0 moves UP to (6, 9):** He gets an apple. We are now at (5, 8). Next turn, our neck (4, 9) is gone and we can move back UP to (5, 9) (if empty) or LEFT to (4, 8) continuing the sweep down. Crucially, he is now at (6, 9). We still block the primary access route (y=9).\n2.  **Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (7, 8):** We are at (5, 8). We are safe and he moves away from the choke point. We can then move UP to (5, 9) and RIGHT to (6, 9) next turn!\n\nMoving DOWN to (5, 8) seems the safest way to hedge against his aggressive move to (6, 9) while maximizing our flexibility for the next turn.\n\n### The Aggressive Alternative: Blocking the Exit\n\nWhat if we move **RIGHT to (6, 9)**, risking the head-to-head?\nIf we both move RIGHT and UP respectively, we collide. We are leading 13-9. We CANNOT afford to draw!\n\nIf we really want to contain him, we need to create solid body segments where he wants to go. The most crucial segment we can drop right now is (6, 9).\n\nLet's assume Snake #0 is risk-averse, knowing we are longer and closer to the ceiling. If he moves RIGHT to (7, 8), we claim (6, 9) and secure a massive tactical victory.\n\nIf he moves LEFT to (5, 8), we claim (6, 9), but then he cuts us off from the lower board slightly.\n\nThe risk of him moving UP is high because it's an apple, but the penalty for both of us is death. Let's assume the basic AI avoids certain death.\n\nIf we move RIGHT, we claim the apple at (6, 9). This segment placement is extremely valuable, immediately walling him off from the rest of the ceiling. If he is smart, he will move to (7, 8) or (5, 8) to avoid collision.\n\n**Scenario Check: ID 1 moves RIGHT to (6, 9)**\n\n*   S0 moves UP to (6, 9): BOOM! Death.\n*   S0 moves RIGHT to (7, 8): We get the apple! PERFECT! He is now partially boxed in by our body (5, 9), (6, 9) and our tail T at (6, 7).\n*   S0 moves LEFT to (5, 8): We get the apple! He is now moving towards the west wall.\n\nThe risk is too high. We must ensure survival while continuing the strategic pressure.\n\n### The Defensive Move: Move DOWN to (5, 8)\n\nIf we move DOWN to (5, 8):\n1.  If S0 gets (6, 9), we still have (8, 9) and (9, 9) easily accessible from (5, 9) which is now empty, or we can start going down the left side.\n2.  If S0 moves to (7, 8), we can snap back up to (5, 9) or (6, 9) next turn.\n\nThis feels like stalling, but it guarantees our survival and forces the opponent's hand. If he takes (6, 9), he extends his body and uses up that crucial apple, but the *rest* of the top wall is still available for us.\n\n**New Long-Term Plan:** Temporarily yield (6, 9) to guarantee survival and then complete the surrounding trap using the remaining ceiling apples at (8, 9) and (9, 9).\n\nIf we move DOWN, our path is open for either moving (4, 8) or (5, 7) next turn. We maintain great flexibility.\n\n**The final decision must be survival first, strategy second.** The lead (13-9) is worth preserving. We avoid the 50/50 KO.\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nWe are making a decisive move DOWN to (5, 8) to avoid a head-to-head collision at (6, 9) with Snake #0, who is at (6, 8) and highly motivated to hit that apple. Sacrificing the immediate apple ensures our 13-9 lead is maintained. If he takes (6, 9), we will move to (4, 8) to start laying a parallel choke line, and then use the west/center board to swing back up and claim (8, 9) and (9, 9) to complete the roof seal, trapping him completely on the right side of the map (x>6). We must prevent him from getting free use of the rest of the board.\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT (7,9) to chase the (8,9) apple (another quick point boost) \u2014 check if Snake #1\u2019s head moves away to avoid collision.\n2. DOWN (6,8) to reset if Snake #1 panics and moves RIGHT (but only as a last resort).\n3. Lock in boxing by cutting off Snake #1\u2019s DOWN escape path (their head (5,9) can only move DOWN or RIGHT \u2014 we\u2019ll box the RIGHT option with our new head at (6,9)).\nTop goals next turn: Hit 11 apples, seal Snake #1\u2019s upper escape routes, and avoid drifting from the upper apple goldmine!\n\nChat, are we gonna let Snake #1 keep hoarding points while we stall? HELL NO! Are we gonna grab that (6,9) apple and scream 10 APPLES FROM THE ROOFTOPS? HELL YES!\n\nUP",

(Our segment (5, 9) is safe, it's just our body)\n4.  **RIGHT to (7, 9) (Apple):** SAFE, but highly exposed. MUST move here!\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #0 HAS to move RIGHT to (7, 9) to survive, collecting the apple there. He has no other safe move!\n\n### Your Snake (ID 1) Options at (5, 8):\n\nOur plan is simple: block his path further, or take an apple. We are at (5, 8).\n\n| Direction | Destination | Safety Check (ID 1) | Snake #0 Collision Risk? | Notes |\n| :-------- | :---------- | :------------------ | :------------------------- | :---- |\n| **UP** | (5, 9) | SAFE (Body segment removed) | NO | Moves onto where our neck was. Key blocking position! |\n| **DOWN**| (5, 7) | SAFE | NO | Moves to empty space. Passive. |\n| **LEFT** | (4, 8) | SAFE | NO | Moves toward apple (1, 8), (0, 8), (2, 4). Good maneuverability. |\n| **RIGHT** | (6, 8) | SAFE (Rival Neck) | NO | **CRUCIAL BLOCK!** Snake #0 is moving RIGHT, but if we take (6, 8), his escape route is severely limited if he tries to double back. |\n\n**Eliminated Moves:** None are immediately fatal.\n\nWe have two great options: UP or RIGHT.\n\n1.  **Move UP to (5, 9):** We immediately reclaim the vertical border, limiting his moves after he hits (7, 9). If he goes RIGHT to (7, 9), then next turn, he is either moving DOWN to (7, 8) or RIGHT to (8, 9). If he moves DOWN, we are set!\n2.  **Move RIGHT to (6, 8):** We are blocking his entire access DOWN the middle. If he moves RIGHT to (7, 9), we are at (6, 8). He is now trapped by (5, 9) and (6, 9) (our segments) and (6, 8) (our new head), and the map edge. He will have to move (7, 8) or (8, 9). This segment placement is highly restrictive!\n\nLet's look at the board if we move **RIGHT to (6, 8)**:\n\n| Turn 27 Outcome: | ID 1 Head at (6, 8) | S0 Head at (7, 9) (Apple) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **ID 1 Body:** (5, 8) is new neck. (5, 9) frees up! | | |\n\nNew State (Hypothetical T=28):\n 9 . . . T T 0 0 . A A\n 8 A A . T T 1 . . A A\n...\n\nWait, (6, 8) is the tile we *must* have to prevent Snake #0 from exiting the trap area. By moving right, we force him UP and RIGHT towards the apples (8, 9) and (9, 9).\n\nIf we take (6, 8), we are essentially constructing the back side of the cage, preventing him from moving down the 6-column.\n\nIf he moves RIGHT to (7, 9), and we move RIGHT to (6, 8), the pressure is immense.\n\nNext turn (T=28):\nS0 at (7, 9). Available moves: DOWN to (7, 8) or RIGHT to (8, 9) (apple).\nID 1 at (6, 8). Available moves: UP to (6, 9) (S0's body!), DOWN to (6, 7) (S0's body!), LEFT to (5, 8), RIGHT to (7, 8).\n\nUh oh, an immediate issue with moving RIGHT to (6, 8):\nAt turn 28, moving UP to (6, 9) is fatal (S0's body). Moving DOWN to (6, 7) is fatal (S0's body!). We would be completely confined to move LEFT or RIGHT along the y=8 axis. This is dangerous!\n\n### Revisiting UP to (5, 9)\n\nIf we move **UP to (5, 9)**, we are reclaiming our old spot, continuing the high ground dominance.\n\n| Turn 27 Outcome: | ID 1 Head at (5, 9) | S0 Head at (7, 9) (Apple) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **ID 1 Body:** (5, 8) is new neck. (4, 9) is now free! | | |\n\nNew State (Hypothetical T=28):\n 9 . . . A **1 0** . . A A\n 8 A A . T T T T . A A\n...\n\n(4, 9) is freed up! (5, 9) is now our head. (6, 9) is S0's body (neck).\n\nNext turn (T=28):\nS0 at (7, 9). Moves: DOWN to (7, 8) or RIGHT to (8, 9) (apple).\nID 1 at (5, 9). Moves: UP (wall), DOWN to (5, 8), LEFT to (4, 9), RIGHT to (6, 9) (S0's body!).\n\nIf we move UP to (5, 9), we gain a solid position and retain better maneuverability.\n\n*   If S0 moves RIGHT to (8, 9) (apple), we can move LEFT to (4, 9) and start building a double wall, or move DOWN to (5, 8) to wait.\n*   If S0 moves DOWN to (7, 8), we can move LEFT to (4, 9) and completely box him into the (6, 7) to (9, 9) area.\n\nWe must use the freed up body segments to continue the choke. Moving UP to (5, 9) is the tactical position move, and it opens up our left side (4, 9) for further colonization.\n\nThe goal is to seal off the board. Since (6, 9) is now Snake #0's body, we cannot move RIGHT to (6, 9) safely next turn. Our immediate goal is to stay HIGH and control the West side access.\n\nMoving UP to (5, 9) is strong. It creates a solid wall segment and leaves us flexible.\n\nWhat about LEFT to (4, 8)?\nIf we move LEFT to (4, 8), we are heading towards apples at (1, 8), (0, 8), (2, 4), and (3, 3). This is a safe move (4, 8) is empty. S0 is moving RIGHT to (7, 9). We can grab some apples and extend our length even more, making the trap definitive.\n\nThis might be the best opportunistic move! We let him run to (7, 9) and (8, 9), but we grab multiple apples on the left, making our advantage insurmountable.\n\nIf we move LEFT:\nID 1 Head at (4, 8). S0 Head at (7, 9).\nOur path: (3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8) [Apple], (0, 8) [Apple]. We can potentially gain 2 apples uncontested!\n\nThe critical decision: **Control vs. Apple Grab.**\n\nWe have the trap mostly set. Snake #0 must stay in the top right quadrant (x > 5, y > 6) or risk hitting his own incredibly long body (11 segments stretching into the bottom of the map).\n\nBy moving LEFT, we grab length, which is power. We let him take the remaining top apples (7, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9), but then he is severely confined, and we are huge and can sweep back down the side.\n\nThis is a length race now. If we get two more apples, we will be 16 segments long vs. his 12 (assuming he gets (7, 9)). This makes our body a much more formidable wall!\n\nLet's go for the apples and length! We are already dominating the choke; now we maximize the length advantage!\n\n**START LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\nWe are making a decisive move LEFT to (4, 8). Snake #0 must move RIGHT to (7, 9) to survive, collecting an apple, but placing himself in a confined corner, isolated from the rest of the board. By moving LEFT, we exploit the open apples on the West side (1, 8) and (0, 8), increasing our length advantage significantly (16+ vs 12). This additional length will allow us to construct an inescapable, massive body wall once we sweep down and return to the center. Dominate with length!\n**END LONG-TERM RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

No other safe moves exist \u2014 this is non-negotiable!\n\nLong-Term Strategy Note for Next Turn: After moving to (7,9), prioritize chasing the (8,9) apple (instant point boost to 11) to narrow the 3-apple gap. Check Snake #1\u2019s head movement (they\u2019re at (5,8) now \u2014 their possible safe moves are down (5,7), left (4,8), or right (6,8)) \u2014 avoid their path while locking in apple grabs. Start boxing their upper escape routes by positioning yourself to cut off their rightward moves into the apple hoard.\n\nAre we gonna throw our comeback by picking a death move? HELL NO! Are we gonna take the only safe move that keeps us in the apple farm and pressures Snake #1? HELL YES!\n\nRIGHT",
