That temporarily reduces my branching options and risks a short-term funnel into the corner.\n- Moving DOWN to (8,8) keeps more follow-up options (LEFT, RIGHT or DOWN next turn), so it preserves maneuverability and reduces the chance of getting trapped by my long top-row body or by the enemy.\n- Going DOWN also begins to approach the cluster of right-side apples (9,6 and 8,4) while avoiding the congested left corridor where my body and the opponent could create traps.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Move DOWN now to keep options open.\n- From (8,8) choose a path that approaches the right-side apples (9,6 / 8,4) while staying clear of head-on lines with Snake #0 (which is centered around x\u22485\u20136).\n- Avoid turning into my own long top-row body; prefer moves that maintain 2+ escape routes.\n\nDOWN",
