The board is wide open, and we've got a lot of apples to munch on. But remember, we're not just here to eat apples; we're here to dominate and take down our rival!\n\nFirst, let's check out the board. Our head is at (0, 5), and Snake #0's head is at (4, 4). We're both at the bottom of the board, but we've got some space to maneuver.\n\n**Possible Moves:**\n1. **UP**: Move to (0, 6)\n2. **DOWN**: Move to (0, 4)\n3. **LEFT**: Move to (-1, 5) - Off the board! Nope, not an option.\n4. **RIGHT**: Move to (1, 5)\n\n**Eliminating Deadly Moves:**\n- LEFT is off the board, so that's a no-go.\n\n**Safe Moves:**\n- UP, DOWN, RIGHT\n\n**Strategy:**\nWe want to keep our options open and avoid getting boxed in. Moving UP or RIGHT seems like a good start. Moving DOWN might put us closer to Snake #0, but we don't want to risk a head-on collision just yet.\n\nLooking at the apples, there's one at (1, 5) which is to our RIGHT. That's a juicy target! But we also want to keep an eye on Snake #0. If we move RIGHT, we'll be closer to that apple and also have a better position to react to Snake #0's moves.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nFor the next few turns, let's focus on growing our snake and controlling the board. We'll aim to cut off Snake #0's movement and force them into a tight spot. Keep an eye on their head and body positions, and be ready to strike when the time is right!\n\n**Final Move:**\nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Alright chat, let's break this down! \ud83d\udd25\n\nFirst turn, both snakes are just heads, no bodies yet. We're at (4,4), enemy at (0,5). Apples everywhere but we ignore them for now? Nah, we gotta grow to dominate, but SAFELY.\n\nLet's check each direction:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (4,5). Is that safe?  \n- Not off board (y=5 is fine).  \n- No body yet.  \n- Enemy head is at (0,5) \u2014 that's 4 cells away horizontally, so no immediate collision unless he moves RIGHT 4 times (impossible).  \n- But wait \u2014 simultaneous move: enemy could move DOWN to (0,4), LEFT to (-1,5) invalid, RIGHT to (1,5), UP to (0,6). So he can't reach (4,5) this turn.  \n- Safe.\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (4,3).  \n- On board.  \n- Safe from self.  \n- Enemy can't reach (4,3) in one move.  \n- Safe.\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (3,4).  \n- On board.  \n- Safe.\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (5,4).  \n- On board.  \n- Safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe immediately. But which is best strategically?\n\nWe want to **box in the enemy** long-term. Enemy is on left side (x=0). If we move LEFT toward him, we start cutting off board space. But moving toward him too fast risks head-on collision later \u2014 but right now we have same length (0 apples), so head-on would be double KO \u2014 not good unless we have advantage.\n\nBetter to **grow first** to get length advantage, then force head-on. So maybe go for nearest apple? Let's see apples: (6,4) is 2 right, (3,7) is up/left, (2,7) up/left, (1,5) up/left, etc. Closest by Manhattan distance: (6,4) is 2 away right, (3,7) is 3 away, (1,5) is 4 away, (4,7) is 3 away.\n\n(6,4) is to our RIGHT. That's an apple at (6,4). Moving RIGHT gets us closer to it (from 4,4 to 5,4, then next turn could go RIGHT again to (6,4) to eat it). That grows us first.\n\nBut moving RIGHT also moves us away from enemy \u2014 gives him more space on left. That's fine early \u2014 grow in safety then attack.\n\nCheck if moving RIGHT risks enemy cutting us off? Not yet \u2014 he's far.\n\nWhat about moving UP to (4,5)? Apple at (1,5) is far left, but (3,7) is closer if we go up then left. But that moves us toward enemy with no length advantage yet.\n\nI think: **Get first apple safely** \u2192 go RIGHT toward (6,4). Next turn we can eat it if still there.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT leaves us with more open space (right side board less cluttered). Downside? Puts enemy on our left \u2014 he might get apples on left side. But we can trap him later after we grow.\n\n**Plan for next turns**:  \n1. Go RIGHT this turn to (5,4).  \n2. Next turn if apple at (6,4) still there, go RIGHT to eat it and grow.  \n3. Then start moving up/left to pressure enemy, using our longer body to limit his moves.\n\nAll moves are safe, so RIGHT is best for early growth toward nearest apple.\n\nFinal move:\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #1 is at (1,5) with a body segment at (0,5) \u2014 he ate an apple last turn! He's now length 2, we're still length 1. He has a 1-apple lead, so we CANNOT afford a head-on collision yet \u2014 we'd lose! Gotta grow safely first.\n\nLet's check our four moves:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (5,5)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- Into own body? No body yet (just head).  \n- Into enemy body? Enemy body is at (0,5) \u2014 far away.  \n- Head-on risk? Enemy head at (1,5) could move RIGHT to (2,5), DOWN to (1,4), LEFT to (0,5) (into his own tail \u2014 safe for him), UP to (1,6).  \n(5,5) is safe from his possible moves this turn.  \n\u2705 Safe.\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (5,3)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- No self-collision.  \n- Enemy body at (0,5) far.  \n- Enemy head can't reach (5,3) in one move.  \n\u2705 Safe.\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (4,4)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- That's our previous head position \u2014 empty now.  \n- Enemy head could move RIGHT to (2,5) \u2014 not (4,4).  \n\u2705 Safe.\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (6,4)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- Apple at (6,4)! If we move RIGHT, we eat it and grow to length 2.  \n- Enemy head can't reach (6,4) in one move.  \n\u2705 Safe and gets us an apple!\n\nSo all four are safe. But which is best strategically?\n\nWe want to **match his length ASAP** so we can fight evenly. Eating the apple at (6,4) does that \u2014 we go from length 1 to 2, same as him. Then we have equal score (1 apple each). After that, we can start being aggressive.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6,4) also keeps us near other apples \u2014 (6,7), (4,7), (8,3) nearby. And it stays away from enemy for now, letting us grow safely.\n\nWhat about moving toward enemy? Too risky while shorter \u2014 if we go LEFT to (4,4) or UP to (5,5), we get closer but still shorter, and he might try to cut us off. Better to equalize first.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT sets us up to possibly go UP next to (6,5) toward more apples, or continue right to (7,4) to control right side.\n\nLong-term plan:  \n1. This turn: RIGHT to eat apple at (6,4) \u2192 grow to length 2, tie score.  \n2. Next turn: assess enemy movement \u2014 likely he'll go for another apple on left side. We can start moving up/left to pressure him, using our new length to limit his space.  \n3. Trap him against left wall once we have equal or longer length.\n\nChat, this is the play \u2014 secure the bag, tie the score, then go for the throat! \ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udca5\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #1 is length 2, head at (2,5), body at (1,5). Score is tied 1 apple each! Now we can FIGHT! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nChecking moves:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (6,5)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- Self-collision? Body at (5,4) \u2014 safe.  \n- Enemy body at (1,5) \u2014 far.  \n- Head-on risk? Enemy head could move RIGHT to (3,5), DOWN to (2,4), LEFT to (1,5) (into his own body \u2014 he'd die! risky for him), UP to (2,6).  \n(6,5) is safe from his possible moves.  \n\u2705 Safe.\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (6,3)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- No self-collision.  \n- Enemy can't reach in one move.  \n\u2705 Safe.\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (5,4)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- That's our own body segment! \ud83d\udc80 Moving LEFT would crash into ourselves \u2014 ELIMINATE!  \n\u274c **DEAD** \u2014 can't go backwards into our neck!\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (7,4)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- No self-collision.  \n- Enemy can't reach.  \n\u2705 Safe.\n\nSo LEFT is out. UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n\nStrategic thinking:  \nWe're tied in length now \u2014 we can start being aggressive! Enemy is on the left side near apples at (3,7), (2,7), (3,5), (2,4). If he eats another, he'll be longer and could bully us. We need to pressure him!\n\nUP to (6,5) moves us toward the center and closer to top apples (6,7), (4,7) \u2014 good for growth.  \nDOWN to (6,3) moves toward bottom apples (6,1), (9,2), (9,3) \u2014 but takes us away from enemy.  \nRIGHT to (7,4) moves toward right-side apples (8,3) \u2014 but also away from enemy.\n\nWe want to **cut off his expansion** while growing ourselves. If we go UP, next turn we could go LEFT toward (5,5) or (4,5) to get between him and the top apples. That\u2019s controlling the board!\n\nAlso, if enemy moves UP to (2,6) or RIGHT to (3,5), we'll be in better position to intercept.\n\nLong-term plan:  \n1. This turn: UP to (6,5) \u2014 advance toward center/top apples, maintain safe distance but start closing in.  \n2. Next turn: likely move LEFT to (5,5) or (4,5) to block his path upward.  \n3. Force him toward left wall (0,5) area \u2014 trap him!\n\nChat, we're going on the offensive! Let's box him in! \ud83d\udc0d\u2694\ufe0f\n\nUP",

Enemy snake #1 is length 4, head at (3,5), body: [(2,5), (1,5), (0,5)], apples: 3. He\u2019s longer than us! We can\u2019t take a head-on collision yet \u2014 we\u2019d lose. Gotta play smart and grow while boxing him in! \ud83d\udc0d\u2694\ufe0f\n\nChecking moves:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (6,6)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- Self-collision? Body at (6,4) \u2014 safe.  \n- Enemy body? Far.  \n- Head-on risk? Enemy could move UP to (3,6), DOWN to (3,4), LEFT to (2,5) (into his body \u2014 he\u2019d die, unlikely), RIGHT to (4,5).  \n(6,6) is safe from his possible heads.  \n\u2705 Safe.\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (6,4)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- That\u2019s our own body segment! \ud83d\udc80 Moving DOWN would crash into ourselves \u2014 ELIMINATE!  \n\u274c **DEAD** \u2014 can\u2019t go backwards into neck!\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (5,5)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- Self-collision? No.  \n- Enemy head could move RIGHT to (4,5) \u2014 that\u2019s adjacent! If we both go into (4,5)? He\u2019s longer, we die in head-on. If he goes RIGHT and we go LEFT, we meet at (5,5) vs (4,5) \u2014 not same cell, but close. Risk of him moving RIGHT into us next turn? But this turn, (5,5) is safe from his possible heads.  \n\u2705 Safe for now.\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (7,5)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- No self-collision.  \n- Enemy can\u2019t reach in one move.  \n\u2705 Safe.\n\nSo DOWN is out. UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\nStrategic thinking:  \nWe\u2019re shorter (length 2 vs 4). Need apples! Look at board: apples at (3,7), (2,7), (8,3), (3,0), (2,0), (0,0), (9,2), (6,1), (4,7), (6,7), (1,9), (2,4), (9,3), (0,1), (0,6).  \nClosest to us: (6,7) above, (8,3) right-down, (6,1) below, (4,7) left-up.  \nEnemy is near (3,7), (2,7), (2,4). He might go for those.\n\nIf we go UP to (6,6), we\u2019re closer to (6,7) apple \u2014 could grab it next turn and tie length at 3 vs 4. Also positions us to cut off his path upward.  \nIf we go LEFT to (5,5), we move toward center, closer to apples (4,7) and (3,7) but also closer to enemy \u2014 risky since he\u2019s longer.  \nIf we go RIGHT to (7,5), we move toward (8,3) apple but away from enemy \u2014 lets him grow uncontested.\n\nWe need to grow but also limit his expansion. Going UP seems balanced \u2014 we move toward apple and keep distance from his head.  \nGoing LEFT could provoke a head-on if he moves RIGHT \u2014 but he might not, since he\u2019s long and might avoid risk. Still, too risky when we\u2019re shorter.\n\nLong-term plan:  \n1. This turn: UP to (6,6) \u2014 aim for (6,7) apple next turn.  \n2. Next turn: if apple still at (6,7), take it and grow to length 3.  \n3. Then start moving left toward (5,7) or (4,7) to block enemy from top apples.  \n4. Force him toward left wall and trap him when we\u2019re equal or longer!\n\nChat, we\u2019re playing the long game \u2014 grow first, then attack! \ud83c\udfaf\ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

Moving DOWN might put us closer to Snake #0, but we don't want to risk a head-on collision just yet.\n\nLooking at the apples, there's one at (5, 5) which is to our RIGHT. That's a juicy target! But we also want to keep an eye on Snake #0. If we move RIGHT, we'll be closer to that apple and also have a better position to react to Snake #0's moves.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nFor the next few turns, let's focus on growing our snake and controlling the board. We'll aim to cut off Snake #0's movement and force them into a tight spot. Keep an eye on their head and body positions, and be ready to strike when the time is right!\n\n**Final Move:**\nRIGHT",

Enemy snake #1 is length 4, head at (4,5), body: [(3,5), (2,5), (1,5)], apples: 3. He's STILL longer! We gotta grow smart and start cutting off his space. \ud83d\udc0d\u2694\ufe0f\n\nChecking moves:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (6,7)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- Self-collision? Body at (6,5) \u2014 safe.  \n- Enemy body? No.  \n- Head-on risk? Enemy could move UP to (4,6), DOWN to (4,4), LEFT to (3,5) (his own body \u2014 he'd die), RIGHT to (5,5).  \n(6,7) is safe from his possible heads.  \n\u2705 Safe. Also there's an apple at (6,7)! \ud83c\udf4e Immediate growth to length 3 if we take it!\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (6,5)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- That's our own body segment! \ud83d\udc80 Moving DOWN would crash into ourselves \u2014 ELIMINATE!  \n\u274c **DEAD** \u2014 can't go backwards into neck!\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (5,6)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- Self-collision? No.  \n- Enemy head could move RIGHT to (5,5) \u2014 that's adjacent diagonally. If we go LEFT to (5,6) and he goes RIGHT to (5,5), we're safe this turn. But next turn he could move UP into us if we stay.  \n\u2705 Safe for now.\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (7,6)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- No self-collision.  \n- Enemy can't reach in one move.  \n\u2705 Safe.\n\nSo DOWN is out. UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\nStrategic thinking:  \nWe're shorter (length 2 vs 4). Need apples FAST! Apple at (6,7) is RIGHT THERE \u2014 taking it gets us to length 3, closer in score, and denies it from enemy.  \nIf we don't take it, enemy might loop up and grab it later.  \nGoing LEFT or RIGHT doesn't get us an apple this turn, delays growth.\n\nBut wait \u2014 is UP risky? Enemy head at (4,5). He could move UP to (4,6) or RIGHT to (5,5). Neither threatens (6,7) this turn. We're clear.\n\nLong-term plan after eating apple:  \n1. This turn: UP to (6,7) \u2014 eat apple, grow to length 3.  \n2. Next turn: from (6,7), consider moving LEFT to (5,7) to block enemy's access to top row apples (like (4,7)).  \n3. Enemy is at (4,5) \u2014 if he moves UP, he's at (4,6). We can pressure from above.  \n4. Goal: keep growing while herding him toward left wall. When we're equal or longer, force head-on!\n\nChat, this is a NO-BRAINER \u2014 free apple, free growth, positions us to dominate the top! Let's feast! \ud83c\udfaf\ud83c\udf4e\n\nUP",

Enemy snake #1 is length 4, head at (5,5), body: [(4,5),(3,5),(2,5)], apples: 3. He's still longer by 1, but we're closing the gap! \ud83d\udc0d\u2694\ufe0f\n\nChecking moves:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (6,8)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- Self-collision? Body at (6,6) and (6,5) \u2014 safe.  \n- Enemy body? No enemy segments at (6,8).  \n- Head-on risk? Enemy head at (5,5). His possible moves: UP to (5,6), DOWN to (5,4), LEFT to (4,5) (his own body \u2014 he'd die), RIGHT to (6,5) (our old tail, but that's empty now? Wait, we moved from (6,6) to (6,7), so (6,5) is our second body segment. Yes, it's our body! If he goes RIGHT to (6,5), he crashes into us and dies! That's good for us! But head-on? (6,8) vs his possible heads: (5,6),(5,4),(6,5) \u2014 none match (6,8). \u2705 Safe this turn.\n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (6,6)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- That's our own body segment right behind our head! \ud83d\udc80 Moving DOWN would crash into ourselves \u2014 ELIMINATE! \u274c **DEAD**\n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (5,7)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- Self-collision? No.  \n- Enemy possible heads: (5,6),(5,4),(4,5),(6,5) \u2014 none are (5,7). \u2705 Safe.\n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (7,7)  \n- On board: yes.  \n- Self-collision? No.  \n- Enemy possible heads: same as above \u2014 none are (7,7). \u2705 Safe.\n\nSo DOWN is out. UP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\n\nStrategic thinking:  \nWe need to keep growing and pressure the enemy! He's at (5,5). If he moves UP to (5,6), he's closer to us. If he moves RIGHT to (6,5), he crashes into our body and dies \u2014 that's a free win! But we can't rely on him being dumb.\n\nApples on board: (3,7),(2,7),(8,3),(3,0),(2,0),(0,0),(9,2),(6,1),(4,7),(1,9),(2,4),(9,3),(0,1),(0,6),(0,3).  \nClosest apple to us? (4,7) is two steps LEFT and DOWN from (6,7). (3,7) is three steps LEFT. (2,7) is four steps LEFT.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (5,7), we're closer to those apples on row 7. If we go UP to (6,8), we're moving away from them but gaining height \u2014 could trap enemy against top later. If we go RIGHT to (7,7), we're moving toward right side apples like (8,3),(9,2),(9,3) but that's far.\n\nWe also need to think about future safe moves:  \nFrom (6,8): next turn could go LEFT to (5,8) or RIGHT to (7,8) or DOWN to (6,7) (but that's into our body next turn? Our body will be at (6,7),(6,6),(6,5) after this move if we go UP). Actually if we go UP, our body becomes [(6,7),(6,6),(6,5)], so (6,7) is our neck \u2014 can't go DOWN next turn. That reduces options.\n\nFrom (5,7): body becomes [(6,7),(6,6),(6,5)], so next turn from (5,7) possible moves: UP to (5,8), DOWN to (5,6), LEFT to (4,7) (apple!), RIGHT to (6,7) (our neck \u2014 not allowed). So two safe moves plus an apple opportunity!\n\nFrom (7,7): body same, next turn moves: UP to (7,8), DOWN to (7,6), LEFT to (6,7) (neck \u2014 no), RIGHT to (8,7). Two safe moves, no immediate apple.\n\nChat, I'm thinking LEFT to (5,7) sets us up to grab (4,7) next turn \u2014 that's growth, plus we're cutting off enemy's access to top-left apples. Enemy at (5,5) might move UP to (5,6) \u2014 then we're adjacent vertically? We'd be at (5,7), he'd be at (5,6) \u2014 that's dangerous next turn if we both move toward each other. But we can avoid that by going for the apple (4,7) next turn, moving away from him.\n\nGoing UP to (6,8) avoids immediate adjacency but delays apple eating. We need to catch up in length to force head-on when we have advantage!\n\nLet's be aggressive \u2014 go LEFT toward the apple cluster and pressure from above! \ud83c\udfaf\n\nLEFT",

Our safe moves vs his possible heads:  \nIf we go UP to (5,8), his heads (6,6),(6,4),(5,5),(7,5) \u2014 no match. \u2705  \nIf we go DOWN to (5,6), his head could be at (6,6) \u2014 that's not same cell. But (5,6) vs (6,6) different, so safe. \u2705  \nIf we go LEFT to (4,7), no match. \u2705\n\nNo immediate head-on risk this turn.\n\nStrategic thinking:  \nWe need to grow! Apples nearby: (4,7) is LEFT from us \u2014 that's an apple in one move! \ud83c\udf4e (3,7) is two left, (2,7) three left. Also (1,9) far top-left.\n\nIf we go LEFT to (4,7), we eat an apple, grow to length 4 (tie with enemy!), and our body becomes [(5,7),(6,7),(6,6)] plus new tail. That's huge!\n\nIf we go UP to (5,8), we move away from immediate apple but gain board control top.  \nIf we go DOWN to (5,6), we get closer to enemy head at (6,5) \u2014 risky adjacency next turn.\n\nFuture moves after each:  \n- After LEFT to (4,7) (and eating apple), next turn from (4,7): possible moves UP (4,8), DOWN (4,6), LEFT (3,7) (another apple!), RIGHT (5,7) (our neck \u2014 not allowed). So two safe moves plus potential apple.  \n- After UP to (5,8), next turn from (5,8): UP (5,9), DOWN (5,7) (neck \u2014 no), LEFT (4,8), RIGHT (6,8). Two safe moves.  \n- After DOWN to (5,6), next turn from (5,6): UP (5,7) (neck \u2014 no), DOWN (5,5) (enemy body? Actually enemy body at (5,5) currently, but he'll move), LEFT (4,6), RIGHT (6,6) (our body? Our body after this move would be [(5,7),(6,7),(6,6)], so (6,6) is our tail \u2014 can't go RIGHT). So only LEFT might be safe, risky.\n\nGoing DOWN reduces future options severely! \u274c\n\nChat, the play is clear: GRAB THAT APPLE at (4,7)! \ud83c\udfaf It ties us in length, gives us momentum, and sets up for another apple at (3,7) next. We dominate the left side, pressure enemy from above. He's stuck near bottom-right with fewer apples. Let's grow and crush him! \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating apple at (4,7), assess if enemy moved. Likely go LEFT to (3,7) for another apple or UP to (4,8) to avoid head-on if he approaches. Keep growing, aim to surpass his length, then force a head-on when we have advantage!\n\nLEFT",
