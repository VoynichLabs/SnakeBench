Closest apple to it is (9, 7) or (6, 9) or (0, 8). It might move LEFT to (7, 8) or DOWN to (8, 7) toward (9, 7).  \nI should avoid moving to where it might go if I can guess, but not predictable yet.  \n\n**Apples nearest to me:**  \nClosest apple: (0, 8) is 4 steps left and 1 up from me.  \n(6, 9) is 2 right and 2 up.  \n(9, 7) is 5 right and 0 up/down.  \n(0, 1) and (4, 0) are far away.  \n\nBest apple to target early: (6, 9) is reachable.  \n\nFrom (4, 7):  \n- UP then RIGHT gets me closer to (6, 9).  \n- RIGHT then UP also works.  \nBut I must choose one move now.  \n\n**Future options:**  \n- If I go RIGHT to (5, 7), next turn I can go UP to (5, 8) toward (6, 9).  \n- If I go UP to (4, 8), next turn I can go RIGHT to (5, 8) toward (6, 9).  \n\nBoth are fine.

My (4, 8) is also far.  \n\nBut (4, 8) is closer to apple (0, 8) as well, giving me two apple options later.  \nActually, (4, 8) is only 4 left from apple (0, 8) and 2 right + 1 up from apple (6, 9). That\u2019s a more central position with options.  \n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nMove toward (6, 9) but stay flexible. From (4, 8), I can go RIGHT toward (6, 9) or LEFT toward (0, 8) depending on enemy movement.  \n\n**So move UP now to (4, 8).**  \n\nUP",

Check each move for immediate death:**  \n\nFrom (6, 8):  \n\n- UP \u2192 (6, 9) \u2192 within board, not my body, no enemy body there.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 7) \u2192 within board, safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 8) \u2192 within board, safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 8) \u2192 within board, safe.  \n\nAll four moves are safe from walls and from current positions of enemy body segments (none at those coords).  \n\n---\n\n**2. Consider enemy head movement possibilities:**  \n\nEnemy head at (9, 6), body at (9, 7).  \nEnemy possible moves:  \n- UP from (9, 6) \u2192 (9, 7) \u2192 that\u2019s its own body, so not allowed (death).  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 5) \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 6) \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 death.  \n\nSo enemy can only move DOWN or LEFT this turn.  \n\nWill any of my moves cause head-on collision?  \n\nHead-on collision occurs if my head moves into a cell where enemy head also moves simultaneously.  \nEnemy possible destinations: (9, 5) or (8, 6).  \n\nMy possible destinations:  \n- UP (6, 9) \u2014 not (9, 5) or (8, 6) \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (6, 7) \u2014 not (9, 5) or (8, 6) \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT (5, 8) \u2014 safe.  \n- RIGHT (7, 8) \u2014 safe.  \n\nSo no head-on collision possible this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Apples proximity:**  \n\nClosest apple: (6, 9) is 1 step away (UP).  \nOther apples: (0, 8) is 6 steps, (2, 7) is 4 steps, (0, 1) far, (4, 0) far.  \n\nEating apple at (6, 9) next turn: if I move UP now, I eat it immediately this turn.  \nThat grows me to length 2, tail will be at (6, 8) next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Safety after eating apple:**  \n\nIf I eat apple at (6, 9):  \nNext turn head at (6, 9), body at [(6, 9), (6, 8)]? Wait \u2014 actually, snake grows after eating, so after move UP to apple:  \nHead at (6, 9), body now has old head (6, 8) as segment 2. Length 2.  \n\nNext turn moves from (6, 9):  \n- UP \u2192 off board \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 8) \u2192 own body \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 9) \u2192 safe? Check enemy then.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 9) \u2192 safe? Check enemy then.  \n\nSo from (6, 9), only LEFT and RIGHT possible next turn. That\u2019s risky but manageable if I plan ahead.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Alternative: move toward apple without eating now?**  \n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 8):  \nThen next turn I can go UP to (7, 9), then LEFT to (6, 9) to eat apple \u2014 but enemy might take it first?  \nEnemy at (9, 6) \u2192 (8, 6) or (9, 5) this turn \u2192 still far from (6, 9). Apple could be eaten by me next turn if I\u2019m at (7, 8) now and go UP then LEFT. But that\u2019s two turns to get apple instead of one.  \n\nBut if enemy moves toward (6, 9)? Unlikely quickly.  \n\nActually, apple at (6, 9) \u2014 if I don\u2019t take it now, enemy might take it later if they move up left etc. But enemy is length 2, maybe not going top immediately.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Future options:**  \n\nIf I eat apple now (UP), I\u2019m trapped on top edge with only left/right moves next turn. That\u2019s a slight risk but not fatal if I plan.  \n\nIf I move RIGHT (7, 8), then next turn I can go UP (7, 9) \u2192 then LEFT to (6, 9) to eat apple turn after \u2014 but then I\u2019d be length 1 still for now, not growing.  \n\nGrowing early could help block enemy later.  \n\nGiven scores: enemy has 1 apple, I have 0. Catching up is good.  \n\n---\n\n**7. Decision:**  \n\nUP gives me apple now, grows to length 2, slight restriction next turn but manageable.  \nRIGHT delays apple but keeps more options next turn.  \n\nGiven the board, maybe better to get apple now and deal with top edge next turn. Enemy not near top right yet.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go UP now to (6, 9) and eat apple:  \nNext turn from (6, 9), only LEFT or RIGHT safe. Choose one that avoids likely enemy head positions and heads toward another apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Check each move for immediate death:**  \n\nFrom (6, 9):  \n\n- UP \u2192 (6, 10) \u2192 outside board \u2192 death. \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 8) \u2192 my own body segment \u2192 death. \u274c  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 9) \u2192 within board, not my body, no enemy body there currently. \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 9) \u2192 within board, not my body, no enemy body there currently. \u2705  \n\nSo only LEFT and RIGHT are possible.\n\n---\n\n**2. Consider enemy head movement possibilities:**  \n\nEnemy head at (8, 6), body at (9, 6).  \nPossible moves from (8, 6):  \n- UP \u2192 (8, 7) \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 5) \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 6) \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 6) \u2192 its own body \u274c  \n\nSo enemy can move UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nWill any of my moves cause head-on collision?  \nMy possible destinations: (5, 9) or (7, 9).  \nEnemy possible destinations: (8, 7), (8, 5), (7, 6).  \n\nNo overlap \u2192 safe from head-on collision this turn.\n\n---\n\n**3. Apples proximity:**  \n\nClosest apple: (2, 7) is |5-2| + |9-7| = 3 + 2 = 5 steps from (6, 9)? Wait, Manhattan distance:  \nFrom (6, 9) to (2, 7): dx=4, dy=2 \u2192 6 steps.  \nFrom (6, 9) to (0, 8): dx=6, dy=1 \u2192 7 steps.  \nFrom (6, 9) to (0, 2): dx=6, dy=7 \u2192 13 steps.  \nFrom (6, 9) to (4, 0): dx=2, dy=9 \u2192 11 steps.  \nFrom (6, 9) to (0, 1): dx=6, dy=8 \u2192 14 steps.  \n\nActually (0, 8) is 7 steps, (2, 7) is 6 steps \u2014 both far.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 9): distance to (2, 7) \u2192 dx=3, dy=2 \u2192 5 steps.  \nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 9): distance to (2, 7) \u2192 dx=5, dy=2 \u2192 7 steps.  \nSo LEFT is slightly closer to nearest apple (2, 7).\n\n---\n\n**4. Future options after each move:**  \n\nFrom (5, 9): possible moves next turn:  \n- UP \u2192 off board \u274c  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5, 8) \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 9) \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 9) \u2192 my body? Wait, my body next turn: If I move LEFT now, my head goes to (5, 9), body becomes [(5, 9), (6, 8)]? No \u2014 growth happened last turn, so now length is fixed at 2 unless I eat apple. Actually: last turn I ate apple at (6, 9) so I grew. Current length 2, body is [(6, 9), (6, 8)]? Let\u2019s check: head (6, 9), body [(6, 8)] means tail at (6, 8). So body segment 2 is at (6, 8).  \n\nIf I move LEFT to (5, 9): new head (5, 9), body becomes [(5, 9), (6, 9)], tail at (6, 9)? Wait, snake movement: head moves to (5, 9), each body segment shifts: old head (6, 9) becomes new segment 2, old segment 2 (6, 8) becomes tail? No \u2014 length 2 snake: head moves, old head becomes body segment 1, old body segment 1 becomes tail (and since length 2, tail disappears? Actually tail stays same if no apple eaten).  \n\nLet\u2019s clarify: length 2 snake: head at (6, 9), body [(6, 8)]. Move head to (5, 9), body becomes [(5, 9), (6, 9)], tail at (6, 9)? That means tail stays at old head position? Yes: snake of length 2: head moves, old head becomes body segment 1, old body segment 1 is removed (tail moves forward). So tail disappears from (6, 8), new tail is at old head (6, 9). So body after moving LEFT: [(5, 9), (6, 9)].\n\nSo next turn from (5, 9), body at (6, 9) blocks RIGHT move back to (6, 9).  \n\nFrom (5, 9) next turn safe moves: DOWN (5, 8), LEFT (4, 9).  \n\nFrom (7, 9) after moving RIGHT: body becomes [(7, 9), (6, 9)], tail at (6, 9). Next turn from (7, 9), safe moves: DOWN (7, 8), LEFT (6, 9) is body \u274c, RIGHT (8, 9) \u2705, UP off board \u274c. So DOWN and RIGHT possible.\n\n---\n\n**5. Which gives better future options?**  \n\nLEFT (5, 9): next turn DOWN or LEFT only.  \nRIGHT (7, 9): next turn DOWN or RIGHT only.  \n\nBoth restrict movement similarly. But (5, 9) is closer to apple cluster at left side (0,8), (0,1), (0,2), (2,7).  \nRIGHT (7, 9) moves toward right edge where enemy is near (8,6) \u2014 risk of getting trapped later.\n\n---\n\n**6. Enemy proximity:**  \n\nEnemy at (8, 6) can move UP, DOWN, LEFT. Likely will move toward apples? Nearest apple to enemy: (2, 7) distance: dx=6, dy=1 \u2192 7 steps. (0, 8): dx=8, dy=2 \u2192 10 steps. (4, 0): dx=4, dy=6 \u2192 10 steps. So enemy might move left/up toward (2, 7). That means if I go LEFT toward (2, 7), we might meet later, but currently far.\n\n---\n\n**7. Decision:**  \n\nLEFT seems better:  \n- Closer to nearest apples.  \n- Away from enemy initially.  \n- Next turn options manageable: can go DOWN to (5,8) or LEFT to (4,9).  \n\nRIGHT goes toward right edge and enemy area, fewer apples that direction.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nMove LEFT now to (5, 9). Next turn from (5, 9), choose DOWN to (5, 8) or LEFT to (4, 9) depending on apple positions and enemy location then. Keep moving toward left-side apples while avoiding dead ends.\n\nLEFT",

Length = 2.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 1 \u2013 Check possible moves from (3,8):\n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (3,9)  \n   - In bounds? Yes (y=9 \u2264 9).  \n   - Occupied by your body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? Enemy body at (6,7) and (6,8) \u2014 not (3,9).  \n   - Safe from immediate death? Yes.  \n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (3,7)  \n   - In bounds? Yes (y=7 \u2265 0).  \n   - Occupied by your body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n   - Safe from immediate death? Yes.  \n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (2,8)  \n   - In bounds? Yes (x=2 \u2265 0).  \n   - Occupied by your body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n   - Safe from immediate death? Yes.  \n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,8)  \n   - In bounds? Yes (x=4 \u2264 9).  \n   - Occupied by your body? Yes! That\u2019s your tail segment. Moving backwards into your own body kills you.  \n   - **Eliminate RIGHT**.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy head movement predictions for head-on collisions:  \n\nEnemy head at (6,8). Possible moves: UP\u2192(6,9), DOWN\u2192(6,7) (into its own body \u2014 would kill enemy), LEFT\u2192(5,8), RIGHT\u2192(7,8).  \n\nEnemy will likely avoid DOWN into its own body. So enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nOur candidate safe moves: UP (3,9), DOWN (3,7), LEFT (2,8).  \n\n**Head-on collision check:**  \n- If we go UP to (3,9), enemy could go UP to (6,9) \u2014 no conflict.  \n- If we go DOWN to (3,7), enemy could go LEFT to (5,8) or RIGHT to (7,8) \u2014 no conflict.  \n- If we go LEFT to (2,8), enemy could go LEFT to (5,8) \u2014 no conflict.  \n\nSo no head-on collision risk obvious.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and future options:  \n\nApples:  \n- (0,8) \u2014 from (3,8), moving LEFT 3 steps gets there.  \n- (2,7) \u2014 from (3,8), moving LEFT then DOWN gets there.  \n- (0,1) and (0,2) far away.  \n- (4,0) far away.  \n\nClosest apple: (0,8) is 3 steps left, but requires moving through column 1 and 0 safely.  \n(2,7) is also close: from (3,8) \u2192 LEFT to (2,8), then DOWN to (2,7) gets apple next turn if still there.  \n\nLEFT (2,8) puts us closer to both (0,8) and (2,7).  \n\nUP (3,9) leads to top row, fewer future moves likely.  \nDOWN (3,7) moves away from most apples except (2,7) possibly later.  \n\nLEFT seems best for apple-seeking now.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after move:  \n\nFrom (2,8): possible moves next turn: UP (2,9), DOWN (2,7), LEFT (1,8), RIGHT (3,8) (but (3,8) will be empty after we move). That\u2019s 4 options \u2014 good.  \n\nFrom (3,9): possible moves: DOWN (3,8), LEFT (2,9), RIGHT (4,9) \u2014 3 options, but top row is riskier if enemy approaches.  \n\nFrom (3,7): possible moves: UP (3,8), DOWN (3,6), LEFT (2,7), RIGHT (4,7) \u2014 4 options, but farther from most apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nMove LEFT toward (0,8) and (2,7), keep options open, avoid top edge unless needed.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Next turn from (2,7): possible moves UP (2,8), DOWN (2,6), LEFT (1,7), RIGHT (3,7). All safe unless enemy moves into one. Good options.\n- **LEFT to (1,8)** \u2192 no apple now, but closer to (0,8). Next turn from (1,8): moves UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT except (2,8) might be occupied by our body? Wait: if we move LEFT, our body becomes [(2,8), (3,8)] so (2,8) is our neck, not free next turn. Still 3 safe moves likely.\n- **UP to (2,9)** \u2192 top edge, fewer future moves, away from apples.\n\nBest immediate reward: DOWN to (2,7) for apple + growth.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk check:**\n\nEnemy at (5,8) might move DOWN to (5,7) \u2014 that\u2019s 3 units away from (2,7) horizontally, no conflict. Enemy could move toward (4,0) apple but that\u2019s far.  \nEating apple at (2,7) is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (2,7), we\u2019ll be length 3.

Wait: initial length is 3 if apples = 2? Actually apples collected = 2 means we started length 2, ate 2 apples \u2192 now length 4? Let's check: body has 2 segments after head, so total segments = head + body = 1 + 2 = 3. That means we started length 2, ate 2 apples \u2192 length 4? Contradiction. Let's check rules: eating apple makes you grow by 1 segment next turn? Actually: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point.\" Growth happens immediately after move onto apple, so length increases next turn. Last turn we moved DOWN to (2,7) which had an apple? Actually last turn rationale said apple at (2,7) yes. So last turn we were at head (2,8), body [(3,8)], length 2, moved DOWN to (2,7) apple \u2192 length now 3. Yes: current head (2,7), body [(2,8), (3,8)] length 3. Apples collected = 2 consistent. Good.\n\n- Enemy snake #1: head (4,8), body [(5,8)], length 2.\n\nApples: (0,8), (0,1), (4,0), (0,2), (9,6).\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Possible moves from my head (2,7):**\n1. **UP** \u2192 (2,8)  \n   - In bounds: Yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? Yes, body segment at (2,8) \u2192 death. Eliminate UP.\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (2,6)  \n   - In bounds: Yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? Enemy body at (5,8) \u2192 no.  \n   - Safe from immediate death? Yes.\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (1,7)  \n   - In bounds: Yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n   - Safe? Yes.\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,7)  \n   - In bounds: Yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n   - Safe? Yes.\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy head (4,8) possible moves and head-on collisions:**\nEnemy possible safe moves from (4,8):  \n- UP (4,9): free? Board shows row 9 empty at col 4.  \n- DOWN (4,7): free? Yes.  \n- LEFT (3,8): free? My body at (3,8) \u2192 enemy would die if goes there.  \n- RIGHT (5,8): enemy's own body \u2192 death.\n\nSo enemy's safe moves: UP, DOWN.\n\nOur candidate moves vs enemy possible moves:\n- My DOWN (2,6) vs enemy DOWN (4,7) \u2192 no collision.\n- My LEFT (1,7) vs enemy DOWN (4,7) \u2192 no collision.\n- My RIGHT (3,7) vs enemy DOWN (4,7) \u2192 no collision.\n- My RIGHT (3,7) vs enemy UP (4,9) \u2192 no collision.\n- My DOWN (2,6) vs enemy UP (4,9) \u2192 no collision.\nNo head-on collision possible this turn.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**\nApples: (0,8), (0,1), (4,0), (0,2), (9,6).\n\nFrom (2,7):\n- DOWN (2,6): no apple.\n- LEFT (1,7): no apple, but closer to (0,8) and (0,1)/(0,2).\n- RIGHT (3,7): no apple, closer to (4,0) and (9,6).\n\n(0,8) is 2 steps away from LEFT path (after LEFT to (1,7), next move LEFT to (0,7) then UP to (0,8)).\n(4,0) is far: from (3,7) need 7 steps.\n(9,6) even farther.\n(0,1) and (0,2) are far vertically.\n\nBut immediate apple none.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each move:**\nCheck next turn safe move counts:\n\nIf DOWN to (2,6):  \nNext turn from (2,6): body will be [(2,7), (2,8), (3,8)]? Wait: moving DOWN to (2,6), body becomes head (2,6), then (2,7), (2,8), (3,8)? No: length is 3, so tail (3,8) will be gone if no apple eaten. Actually growth happens only when eating apple. Since no apple at (2,6), length stays 3, so tail (3,8) disappears, body becomes [(2,7), (2,8)]? Let's simulate:  \nCurrent: head (2,7), body [(2,8), (3,8)].  \nMove DOWN to (2,6): new head (2,6), add to front, remove last segment (3,8).  \nNew body: [(2,7), (2,8)]. Yes.\n\nSo from (2,6), possible moves: UP (2,7) occupied by my body \u2192 no, DOWN (2,5) free, LEFT (1,6) free, RIGHT (3,6) free \u2192 3 safe moves.\n\nIf LEFT to (1,7):  \nNew head (1,7), body [(2,7), (2,8)], tail (3,8) gone.  \nFrom (1,7): UP (1,8) free? Board shows (1,8) empty. DOWN (1,6) free, LEFT (0,7) free, RIGHT (2,7) occupied by my body \u2192 no. So 3 safe moves.\n\nIf RIGHT to (3,7):  \nNew head (3,7), body [(2,7), (2,8)], tail (3,8) gone.  \nFrom (3,7): UP (3,8) occupied by my old tail gone? Actually (3,8) was tail, now removed, so free. DOWN (3,6) free, LEFT (2,7) occupied by my body \u2192 no, RIGHT (4,7) free. So 3 safe moves.\n\nAll give 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Avoid enemy future threat:**\nEnemy at (4,8) likely moves DOWN (4,7) or UP (4,9).  \nIf enemy DOWN to (4,7), then my RIGHT to (3,7) is adjacent horizontally (1 apart) \u2014 risky next turn if enemy moves LEFT to (3,7)? Actually enemy at (4,7) could move LEFT to (3,7) next turn if I'm there now? No, I'd be at (3,7) this turn, next turn I move away, but if enemy goes (4,7) then (3,7) is empty next turn? Wait: simultaneous moves: enemy could move LEFT from (4,8) to (3,8) but that's into my old body? My old body at (3,8) will be gone after my move (since tail removed). So enemy could go LEFT to (3,8) safely? Possibly, but enemy might avoid because they think it's occupied? Actually they see current board: (3,8) is my body, so they avoid. So they won't go LEFT this turn. So likely DOWN or UP.\n\nIf enemy DOWN to (4,7), then next turn they're close to me if I go RIGHT (3,7). Could be risky. Safer to go LEFT or DOWN to keep distance.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**\nWe have apples at left edge (0,8), (0,1), (0,2). Moving LEFT positions us better to get (0,8) soon. Also left side less contested \u2014 enemy is on right/middle top. Avoid enemy path toward (4,0) apple maybe.\n\nLEFT seems strategically good: moves toward apples, away from enemy, keeps options open.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove toward (0,8) apple, then possibly down toward (0,1)/(0,2). Keep enemy in view but avoid head-on collisions. Maintain space.\n\nLEFT",

Moving UP is possibly suicidal by colliding into the wall.\n\nSince there is a chance of a head-on collision if enemy moves straight UP, I will play it safe and go UP.\nUP\n\nAlso, long term strategy: Try to stay alive while eating apples/blocking enemy.\nUP",

No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n   - Safe? Yes.  \n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (1, 6):  \n   - In bounds: Yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n   - Safe? Yes.  \n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (0, 7):  \n   - In bounds: Yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n   - Safe? Yes.  \n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 7):  \n   - Occupied by my body? Yes \u2014 my body segment at (2, 7).  \n   - Eliminate RIGHT.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy possible moves and head-on collisions:**  \n\nEnemy head at (3, 8):  \n- UP (3, 9): empty.  \n- DOWN (3, 7): empty.  \n- LEFT (2, 8): my body at (2, 8) \u2192 enemy dies if moves there.  \n- RIGHT (4, 8): enemy\u2019s own body at (4, 8) \u2192 death.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, DOWN.  \n\nCheck head-on collisions:  \n- If I go UP to (1, 8), enemy could go DOWN to (3, 7) \u2192 no collision.  \n- If I go DOWN to (1, 6), enemy could go DOWN to (3, 7) \u2192 no collision.  \n- If I go LEFT to (0, 7), enemy could go DOWN to (3, 7) \u2192 no collision.  \n\nNo head-on risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \n\nFrom (1, 7):  \n- UP (1, 8): closer to apple at (0, 8) \u2014 Manhattan distance from (1, 8) to (0, 8) = 1.  \n- DOWN (1, 6): far from any apple.  \n- LEFT (0, 7): closer to (0, 8) \u2014 distance from (0, 7) to (0, 8) = 1.  \n\nApple (0, 8) is reachable in 1 move from both UP and LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each move:**  \n\nAssume no apple eaten this turn (since none at (1, 8), (1, 6), (0, 7)), so length stays 3, tail (2, 8) removed.  \n\n1. **UP to (1, 8):**  \n   New head (1, 8), body [(1, 7), (2, 7)].  \n   From (1, 8): UP (1, 9) free, DOWN (1, 7) my body \u2192 no, LEFT (0, 8) free (apple), RIGHT (2, 8) free? Actually (2, 8) was tail, now removed \u2192 free.  \n   So safe next moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n2. **DOWN to (1, 6):**  \n   New head (1, 6), body [(1, 7), (2, 7)].  \n   From (1, 6): UP (1, 7) my body \u2192 no, DOWN (1, 5) free, LEFT (0, 6) free, RIGHT (2, 6) free \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\n3. **LEFT to (0, 7):**  \n   New head (0, 7), body [(1, 7), (2, 7)].  \n   From (0, 7): UP (0, 8) free (apple), DOWN (0, 6) free, LEFT out of bounds \u2192 no, RIGHT (1, 7) my body \u2192 no.  \n   So only 2 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Avoid enemy threat:**  \n\nEnemy at (3, 8) will likely move UP or DOWN. If enemy goes DOWN to (3, 7), then next turn they are closer to center. If I go LEFT to (0, 7), I\u2019m far away and safe. If I go UP to (1, 8), I\u2019m still somewhat close horizontally but not adjacent.  \n\nLEFT gives more distance from enemy but reduces future mobility (only 2 moves next turn). UP gives same mobility as DOWN but gets me closer to apple (0, 8).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan:**  \n\nI want apple (0, 8) soon. UP from (1, 7) to (1, 8) keeps more options (3 moves next turn) and is one step from apple. LEFT to (0, 7) also one step from apple but leaves fewer moves after.  \nUP seems better for flexibility while still aiming for the apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter UP to (1, 8), next turn move LEFT to (0, 8) to eat apple, then head down along left edge toward (0, 1)/(0, 2) apples while staying clear of enemy.  \n\nUP",

Next turn from (0, 8), go DOWN to (0, 7) toward lower apples, avoiding top edge. Enemy likely moving along top row (2, 9) or (4, 9), so I\u2019ll be safe on left side.\n\nLEFT is best: immediate score + safe position.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating apple at (0, 8), go DOWN to (0, 7) then continue down left edge to collect (0, 2) and (0, 1) while staying clear of enemy.

Body becomes [(0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7)], tail (2, 7) disappears.  \n   From (0, 9): UP out of bounds, DOWN (0, 8) my body, LEFT out of bounds, RIGHT (1, 9) empty \u2192 only RIGHT safe \u2192 1 move next turn \u2192 risky trap.\n\n2. **DOWN to (0, 7):**  \n   New head (0, 7), no apple \u2192 body [(0, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7)], tail (2, 7) gone.  \n   From (0, 7): UP (0, 8) my body \u2192 no, DOWN (0, 6) free, LEFT out of bounds, RIGHT (1, 7) my body \u2192 no. So only DOWN safe \u2192 1 move next turn \u2192 also risky.\n\nHmm \u2014 both options leave only 1 safe move next turn. That\u2019s bad.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Re-check safe moves:**  \n\nMaybe I missed something: Is RIGHT truly unsafe? My body at (1, 8) is directly behind head? No, my head is at (0, 8), body segment at (1, 8) is not directly behind \u2014 behind would be (1, 8) if I moved LEFT last turn? Wait, last move was LEFT into (0, 8), so previous head was at (1, 8). So body behind head is (1, 8). Moving RIGHT into (1, 8) is moving backward into own body \u2192 death. Yes, that\u2019s the rule: moving directly backwards into your own body kills you. So RIGHT is indeed invalid.\n\nLEFT is out of bounds. So only UP/DOWN.\n\nBoth UP and DOWN lead to only 1 safe move next turn. Which is less dangerous?\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Consider enemy movement:**  \n\nEnemy safe moves: DOWN (2, 8), LEFT (1, 9).  \nIf I go UP to (0, 9), enemy could go LEFT to (1, 9) \u2192 adjacent next turn, possible head-on later if I go RIGHT next turn (but I can\u2019t go RIGHT from (0, 9) because only RIGHT is safe move? Actually from (0, 9) only RIGHT is safe, so I\u2019d go to (1, 9) next turn if alive \u2014 but enemy could be at (1, 9) same turn \u2192 head-on collision. That\u2019s risky.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (0, 7), enemy not coming to (0, 7) likely. But then I\u2019m stuck going DOWN again to (0, 6), moving away from apples (0, 2), (0, 1) \u2014 actually going down gets closer to them over multiple moves. And enemy is far away at top.\n\nSo DOWN seems slightly safer because enemy unlikely to interfere soon.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Plan:**  \n\nGo DOWN to (0, 7). Next turn only DOWN to (0, 6) is safe, then from (0, 6) I\u2019ll have UP (0, 7) body, DOWN (0, 5) free, LEFT out, RIGHT (1, 6) free \u2192 2 moves. That\u2019s better. Then can maneuver toward apples (0, 2), (0, 1).\n\nEnemy may go for (4, 4) apple, leaving left side clear.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter DOWN to (0, 7), next turn DOWN to (0, 6), then RIGHT to (1, 6) to open space, then down toward apples while avoiding top edge.\n\nDOWN",

Possible enemy moves:  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 6)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 7) (occupied by my body segment at (1, 8)? Wait, my body: head (0,6), then (0,7), (0,8), (1,8).

No, after move my body will be: head (0,5), then (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1, 8)? Wait careful: current body: [(0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,8)]. If I move to (0,5) without eating apple, new body = [(0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8)], tail (1,8) disappears. Yes, because snake moves without growing: head moves, each segment moves to previous segment\u2019s position, last segment (tail) vacates. So new body: head (0,5), then (0,6), (0,7), (0,8). Tail gone from (1,8). So next turn from (0,5): UP to (0,6) is body (second segment) \u2192 death. DOWN to (0,4) free, LEFT out, RIGHT to (1,5) free. So only DOWN and RIGHT safe next turn.  \n\nFrom (1, 6) if I move RIGHT:  \nNew body: [(1,6), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8)], tail gone from (1,8).  \nNext turn from (1,6): UP (1,7) free, DOWN (1,5) free, LEFT (0,6) body \u2192 death, RIGHT (2,6) free unless enemy moves there? But we can\u2019t know. But at least 3 options possibly safe unless enemy occupies. Better mobility.\n\nSo **RIGHT** gives more options next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy at (2, 7) could move DOWN to (2, 6), which is adjacent to (1, 6) if I go RIGHT. That\u2019s risky next turn if enemy stays alive. But no immediate collision.  \nIf I go DOWN to (0, 5), enemy is farther away.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nBoth moves safe now. RIGHT gives better future mobility. DOWN gets closer to apples but may trap me on left edge soon. Given my length 4, I should prioritize keeping space. Going RIGHT opens central area.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove RIGHT to (1,6). Next turn, consider moving DOWN to (1,5) to approach lower apples while keeping rightward escape. Avoid moving back left into (0,6) unless necessary. Watch enemy at (2,7) \u2014 if they move toward (2,6), be cautious.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy snake's head is at (1, 6), and its body is at (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8).\n\n1. **Possible moves and immediate consequences:**\n   - **UP:** (2, 7) - This would collide with my body, so it's deadly.\n   - **DOWN:** (2, 5) - This is a safe move.\n   - **LEFT:** (1, 6) - This would collide with the enemy snake's head, resulting in a head-on collision and both snakes die.\n   - **RIGHT:** (3, 6) - This is a safe move.\n\n2. **Evaluate safe moves:**\n   - **DOWN (2, 5):**\n     - It opens up the possibility of moving towards the apples at (0, 1), (0, 2) and (4, 0) in the future.\n     - It avoids any immediate collisions.\n   - **RIGHT (3, 6):**\n     - It could position me to collect the apple at (9, 6) if I move right for next few turns.\n     - It also avoids any immediate collisions.\n\n3. **Consider the enemy snake's possible moves:** The other snake is at (1, 6) with body (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8).\n   - **UP:** (1, 7).\n   - **DOWN:** (1, 5).\n   - **LEFT:** (0, 6) - Results in collision with the snake body.\n   - **RIGHT:** (2, 6) - Head-on collision with my current position.\n\n4. **Decision:**\nChoosing which move is better between DOWN and RIGHT.\n   - If I move DOWN the enemy snake will likely move up or down, and then I could go LEFT next turn.\n   - If I move RIGHT the enemy snake will likely move up or down, and then I could go RIGHT again.\nSince the enemy snake has more apples, it's beneficial to try to kill it.

Let's check: enemy head currently at (2, 6). If enemy stays there and I move there, we collide and both die. But enemy will also move this turn. Possible enemy moves from (2, 6): UP (2, 7) (occupied by its own body? Snake #1 body: [(2, 7)] \u2014 yes, so enemy cannot move UP). DOWN (2, 5) free. LEFT (1, 6) occupied by my head after I move? Wait, if I move RIGHT to (2, 6) and enemy moves LEFT to (1, 6), we swap positions and no head-on collision. But if enemy moves RIGHT to (3, 6) and I move RIGHT to (2, 6), no collision. If enemy moves DOWN to (2, 5) and I move RIGHT to (2, 6), no collision. Only if enemy moves LEFT to (1, 6) and I move RIGHT to (2, 6) \u2014 different cells, so no head-on. However, if enemy chooses to stay (i.e., moves in a way that ends at (2, 6) again), impossible because it can\u2019t move into its own body at (2, 7) or off board. So (2, 6) will be empty after enemy moves. Therefore RIGHT is safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \nEnemy head at (2, 6). Enemy\u2019s possible moves:  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 5)  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 6) (occupied by my head after my move? Depends on my move.)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 6)  \n\nIf I move UP to (1, 7) and enemy moves LEFT to (1, 6) \u2192 different cells, safe.  \nIf I move DOWN to (1, 5) and enemy moves LEFT to (1, 6) \u2192 different cells, safe.  \nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 6) and enemy moves LEFT to (1, 6) \u2192 different cells, safe.  \nNo possible same-cell collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity:**  \nApples: (0, 1), (0, 2), (4, 0), (4, 4), (9, 6).  \nClosest to my head (1, 6): (0, 2) is 4 cells away, (4, 4) is 5 cells away.  \nUP to (1, 7) moves away from all apples.  \nDOWN to (1, 5) moves toward (0, 1) and (0, 2).  \nRIGHT to (2, 6) moves toward center, away from lower-left apples but toward (4, 4) and (9, 6) eventually.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move:**  \nFrom UP (1, 7):  \nNext turn options: UP (1, 8) free, DOWN (1, 6) body (my old head position) \u2192 death, LEFT (0, 7) body (my old third segment) \u2192 death, RIGHT (2, 7) enemy body \u2192 death. So only UP safe next turn \u2014 terrible, traps me.  \n\nFrom DOWN (1, 5):  \nNext turn options: UP (1, 6) body (old head) \u2192 death, DOWN (1, 4) free, LEFT (0, 5) free, RIGHT (2, 5) possibly free (unless enemy moves there). So DOWN and LEFT likely safe \u2014 better than UP.  \n\nFrom RIGHT (2, 6):  \nNext turn options: UP (2, 7) enemy body \u2192 death, DOWN (2, 5) free, LEFT (1, 6) body (old head) \u2192 death, RIGHT (3, 6) free. So DOWN and RIGHT safe \u2014 decent options.  \n\nComparing: UP (1, 7) leads to certain trap. DOWN (1, 5) gives two safe options next turn. RIGHT (2, 6) gives two safe options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy at (2, 6) will move away because it can\u2019t stay. If it moves DOWN to (2, 5), that\u2019s where I might go next turn if I move RIGHT now. That could be risky. If I move DOWN now, enemy is farther away.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision:**  \nUP is immediately safe but leads to a trap next turn \u2014 eliminate.  \nBetween DOWN and RIGHT:  \n- DOWN moves toward apples, away from enemy, gives future flexibility.  \n- RIGHT moves toward center but risks enemy proximity next turn.  \n\nGiven my apple lead (3 vs 1), I should play safer, avoid enemy, and collect apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove DOWN to (1, 5). Next turn, likely move LEFT to (0, 5) to approach apples at (0, 2) and (0, 1) while keeping DOWN as escape. Avoid moving back up into my body. Watch enemy movement \u2014 if enemy moves toward (2, 5), be cautious about going RIGHT later.  \n\nDOWN",

If I move RIGHT to (2, 5) and enemy stays there (impossible, enemy must move because UP (2, 6) is its own body, LEFT (1, 5) is my head now, RIGHT (3, 5) empty, DOWN (2, 4) empty), but if enemy moves DOWN to (2, 4) and I move RIGHT to (2, 5), no collision. If enemy moves RIGHT to (3, 5) and I move RIGHT to (2, 5), no collision. If enemy moves LEFT to (1, 5) and I move RIGHT to (2, 5), different cells \u2192 no collision. So RIGHT is safe this turn.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn**  \nEnemy head at (2, 5) can move: UP (2, 6) its own body \u2192 no; DOWN (2, 4); LEFT (1, 5); RIGHT (3, 5).  \nIf I move LEFT to (0, 5), enemy moves LEFT to (1, 5) \u2192 different cells \u2192 safe.  \nIf I move DOWN to (1, 4), enemy moves LEFT to (1, 5) \u2192 different cells \u2192 safe.  \nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 5), enemy moves LEFT to (1, 5) \u2192 different cells \u2192 safe.  \nNo same-cell collision possible.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nApples: (0, 1), (0, 2), (4, 0), (4, 4), (9, 6).  \nFrom (1, 5):  \n- DOWN to (1, 4) \u2192 closer to (4, 0) and (4, 4) but still far.  \n- LEFT to (0, 5) \u2192 closer to (0, 1), (0, 2).  \n- RIGHT to (2, 5) \u2192 slightly closer to (4, 4) but further from left apples.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility**  \nFrom DOWN (1, 4):  \nNext turn options: UP (1, 5) body? Wait, my old head at (1, 5) will be gone, but my second segment (1, 6) moves to (1, 5) if I move DOWN? Let\u2019s simulate: Current body: head (1, 5), then (1, 6), (0, 6), (0, 7). If I move DOWN to (1, 4), new head (1, 4), body becomes [(1, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6)] (tail (0, 7) disappears because no apple eaten). So next turn, my body occupies (1, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6).  \nFrom (1, 4), next turn: UP (1, 5) body \u2192 death, DOWN (1, 3) free, LEFT (0, 4) free, RIGHT (2, 4) possibly free unless enemy there.  \n\nFrom LEFT (0, 5):  \nNew body: [(0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6)]? Wait, no: moving LEFT means head to (0, 5), then segments: old head (1, 5) becomes second, (1, 6) third, (0, 6) fourth, tail (0, 7) gone. So body: [(0, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6)].  \nFrom (0, 5), next turn: UP (0, 6) body \u2192 death, DOWN (0, 4) free, LEFT off board \u2192 death, RIGHT (1, 5) body \u2192 death. So only DOWN safe next turn \u2192 trap.  \n\nFrom RIGHT (2, 5):  \nNew body: [(2, 5), (1, 5), (1, 6), (0, 6)] (tail gone).  \nFrom (2, 5), next turn: UP (2, 6) enemy body currently at (2, 6) but enemy will move now, so maybe empty next turn? Enemy\u2019s body next turn: if enemy moves DOWN to (2, 4), its body becomes [(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)]? Wait, enemy head (2, 5), body [(2, 6)]. If enemy moves DOWN to (2, 4), new body: [(2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)]? No, length 2 snake (head + 1 body segment), eats apple? No apple at (2, 4), so length stays 2: new body [(2, 4), (2, 5)], old tail (2, 6) gone. So (2, 6) empty next turn. So UP (2, 6) free next turn. DOWN (2, 4) possibly enemy head if enemy goes DOWN? But enemy head could be there. LEFT (1, 5) my body \u2192 death. RIGHT (3, 5) free. So UP and RIGHT safe next turn from (2, 5).  \n\nSo:  \n- DOWN (1, 4) \u2192 next turn DOWN and LEFT likely safe (unless enemy at (2, 4)).  \n- LEFT (0, 5) \u2192 only DOWN safe next turn \u2192 trap.  \n- RIGHT (2, 5) \u2192 UP and RIGHT safe next turn.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Enemy threat**  \nEnemy at (2, 5) likely moves DOWN (2, 4) or RIGHT (3, 5) to avoid my head. If enemy moves DOWN to (2, 4), then my DOWN to (1, 4) puts me adjacent horizontally, which is riskier next turn. If enemy moves RIGHT to (3, 5), then my RIGHT to (2, 5) puts me adjacent vertically.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Apple collection path**  \nI have 3 apples vs enemy 1. I can afford to play safe.  \nLEFT leads to trap next turn \u2192 eliminate.  \nBetween DOWN and RIGHT:  \n- DOWN (1, 4) \u2192 toward left apples eventually but need to go down then left, enemy might be near.  \n- RIGHT (2, 5) \u2192 toward center apples (4, 4), more space.  \n\nRIGHT gives better future mobility (UP and RIGHT safe next turn). DOWN gives DOWN and LEFT safe next turn, but if enemy at (2, 4), my RIGHT next turn blocked.  \n\nGiven board open in center, going RIGHT seems better for long-term survival.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove RIGHT to (2, 5). Next turn, likely go UP to (2, 6) (empty after enemy moves) or RIGHT to (3, 5) to approach (4, 4) apple. Avoid moving back into my body at (1, 5). Watch enemy movement \u2014 if enemy stays near (2, 4), avoid going DOWN next turn.  \n\nRIGHT",
