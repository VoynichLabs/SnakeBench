I have collected 0 apples.\n- Enemy snake (ID 0) is at (1,3) with no body (just the head). It has collected 0 apples.\n- Apples are at: (2,9), (9,0), (6,4), (8,1), (3,3)\n\nThe board is 10x10, coordinates from (0,0) to (9,9).\n\nI need to choose a move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nFirst, consider each direction from my head at (1,1):\n- UP: (1,2)\n- DOWN: (1,0)\n- LEFT: (0,1)\n- RIGHT: (2,1)\n\nNow, check for immediate dangers (death) for each move:\n\n1. UP to (1,2):\n   - Not off the board (within 0-9).\n   - No body segments (my snake has no body yet).\n   - Check enemy: enemy head is at (1,3). If I move to (1,2), that is not the enemy head or body (enemy has no body). However, the enemy might also move this turn. But (1,2) is not currently occupied by any snake.\n   - So, safe for now.\n\n2. DOWN to (1,0):\n   - Within board (0 is valid).\n   - No body.\n   - Enemy not here.\n   - Safe.\n\n3. LEFT to (0,1):\n   - Within board (0 is valid).\n   - No body.\n   - Enemy not here.\n   - Safe.\n\n4. RIGHT to (2,1):\n   - Within board.\n   - No body.\n   - Enemy not here.\n   - Safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe immediately. Now, consider which is best for future moves and apples.\n\nApples: closest apples are at (3,3) and (8,1). (3,3) is at x=3,y=3; (8,1) is at x=8,y=1.\n\nMy position (1,1):\n- To get to (3,3): need to go right and up.\n- To get to (8,1): need to go right (mostly).\n\nAlso, enemy is at (1,3). If enemy moves down, it might go to (1,2) or similar. I should avoid moving directly towards the enemy to prevent head-on collisions.\n\nLet's think about enemy possible moves from (1,3):\n- UP: (1,4) - safe\n- DOWN: (1,2) - safe\n- LEFT: (0,3) - safe\n- RIGHT: (2,3) - safe\n\nAll moves are safe for enemy. But if enemy moves down to (1,2), and I move up to (1,2), we collide and both die. So I should avoid moving to (1,2) if there's a chance enemy moves there.\n\nSimilarly, if I move right to (2,1), and enemy moves right to (2,3), no immediate collision.\n\nNow, consider which moves keep options open:\n\n- UP to (1,2): from there, I can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT (DOWN is back to my tail, but I have no tail so it's safe? Actually, since no body, moving backwards is safe. But if enemy moves down to (1,2), we collide.\n- DOWN to (1,0): from there, I can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n- LEFT to (0,1): from there, I can go UP, RIGHT (DOWN is safe, LEFT is off board).\n- RIGHT to (2,1): from there, I can go UP, DOWN, RIGHT (LEFT is back).\n\nRIGHT seems good because it moves towards the apple at (3,3) and (8,1). Also, it avoids the enemy's area.\n\nUP might be risky because enemy might move down.\n\nDOWN is away from apples.\n\nLEFT is to the edge, which might limit options.\n\nSo, RIGHT is promising.\n\nAlso, apple at (8,1) is on the same row (y=1), so moving right gets closer.\n\nTherefore, I choose RIGHT.\n\nLong-term plan: Move towards the apples, especially (8,1) which is on the same row. Avoid enemy by not going directly up. Try to collect apples and grow.\n\nRIGHT",

No direct collision risk this turn. Possible future risk if it grows and moves toward center.\n\n---\n\n**Apple Targeting:**\nNearest apple is (6,4): distance 2 steps (RIGHT+UP or UP+RIGHT).\nOther apples: (2,9) far, (9,0) far, (8,1) medium, (9,7) far.\n\nUP (5,4) gets me closer to (6,4) (one step away afterward).\nRIGHT (6,3) also good for approach to (6,4) or (8,1).\nDOWN (5,2) moves away from most apples except (9,0) and (8,1), but less optimal.\n\n---\n\n**Future Mobility:**\nFrom (5,4): UP (5,5), DOWN (5,3) \u2013 body segment (blocked), LEFT (4,4), RIGHT (6,4) \u2013 apple! \u2192 3 safe options + chance to eat.\nFrom (6,3): UP (6,4) \u2013 apple!, DOWN (6,2), LEFT (5,3) \u2013 body segment, RIGHT (7,3) \u2192 3 safe options + chance to eat.\nFrom (5,2): UP (5,3) \u2013 body segment (blocked), DOWN (5,1), LEFT (4,2), RIGHT (6,2) \u2192 3 safe options, but blocked UP and away from most apples.\n\nUP or RIGHT both give access to an apple in the next move. UP keeps me closer to top apples afterward. RIGHT could allow immediate apple on next turn via UP.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction:**\nSnake #0 likely moves UP to (2,9) to eat the apple there. That will grow its length to 2, and next turn it will have a body segment at (2,8). It will then be near top edge.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**\nBoth UP and RIGHT are good; UP places me to potentially grab (6,4) next turn if enemy doesn\u2019t interfere, but RIGHT enables a sure path to (6,4) while avoiding being too close to enemy if it moves south later.\n\nActually, UP (5,4) is slightly better because:\n- It is directly adjacent to apple (6,4) next turn via RIGHT.\n- If I go RIGHT to (6,3), then next turn UP to (6,4) also eats apple. But (6,3) might be more exposed if enemy decides to move toward center after eating its apple.\n\nGiven enemy is far north, central/upper movement is safe. I'll go UP.\n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan for next turns:**\nAim to eat (6,4) next. After that, consider (8,1) or (9,7). Keep an eye on enemy #0's growth \u2014 if it eats (2,9), it may come down. Avoid getting trapped in corners; maintain central mobility.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n- **RIGHT:** (7,2) \u2013 Empty. Safe.\n**Conclusion:** UP is invalid.\n\n**Enemy Snake Movement Consideration:**\nEnemy head is at (4,8). Its options:\n- UP: (4,9) \u2013 Empty. Safe.\n- DOWN: (4,7) \u2013 Empty. Safe.\n- LEFT: (3,8) \u2013 Its own body segment. Death.\n- RIGHT: (5,8) \u2013 Empty. Safe.\nSo enemy can move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. All are far from my position. No immediate collision risk this turn. My last move rationale predicted it would go DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT; it moved RIGHT to (4,8), which fits the prediction.\n\n**Apple Targeting and Pathing:**\nNearby apples:\n- (7,0) is 2 cells away (south-southeast).\n- (8,1) is 3 cells away (east-southeast).\n- (1,1) is far away (west-southwest).\n\nMoving DOWN to (6,1) gets me closer to (7,0). Moving LEFT to (5,2) moves away from the closest apples. Moving RIGHT to (7,2) also moves closer to (7,0) and (8,1).\n\n**Future Mobility and Risk Assessment:**\nMy body is to the north. Moving south (DOWN) keeps me in open space. After DOWN to (6,1), my next turn options would likely be DOWN (6,0), LEFT (5,1), or RIGHT (7,1) to approach (7,0).\nMoving RIGHT to (7,2) is also good for apple access, but places me slightly closer to the east edge.\nGiven my short length, staying in the open southern area is preferable to minimize risk.\n\n**Decision:**\nDOWN (6,1) is the best choice. It directly progresses towards the closest apple (7,0), maintains good future mobility in the less crowded south, and avoids any potential conflict with the enemy in the north.\n\n**Short-term Plan for Next Turns:**\nCollect the apple at (7,0) next. From (6,1), consider moving to (7,1) or (6,0) to set up for (7,0). After that, target (8,1). Continue to dominate the south and southwest area where apples are concentrated. The enemy is in the north and is unlikely to interfere soon.\n\nDOWN",

From (6,0), my next turn would allow LEFT (5,0), RIGHT (7,0) for the apple, or UP back to (6,1).\nMoving LEFT to (5,1) moves me away from the cluster of apples to the east.\n\n**Future Mobility and Risk Assessment:**\nFrom (6,1), moving RIGHT (7,1) opens up the eastern board area, which has two apples nearby. My body blocks the north, but south and east are open. This seems promising for quick growth.\nMoving DOWN (6,0) also keeps me safe and gets me the apple next turn, but may slightly limit eastward movement afterwards as I'd be on the bottom row.\nRIGHT seems to offer slightly better access to multiple apples.

Wait, check: (8,0) is empty. The apple at (9,0) is one step further RIGHT and DOWN from (8,0). So, moving DOWN does NOT get an apple this turn, but it sets up perfectly to get the (9,0) apple next turn.\n- **RIGHT (9,1)**: Does not get an apple this turn. Apples are at (9,0) (below it) and (9,7) (far above it).\n\nActually, re-reading the apple list: Apples are at (9, 0), (9, 7), (7, 0), (1, 1). The closest apple is (7,0), which is to my LEFT and DOWN from my head, but LEFT is blocked by my body. The next closest is (9,0), which is to my RIGHT and DOWN. So the best path to an apple is DOWN->RIGHT or RIGHT->DOWN.\n\n**Future Mobility Assessment:**\nFrom (8,0) after DOWN: Next moves would be LEFT (7,0) which has an apple, RIGHT (9,0) which has an apple, or UP (8,1) which is my body. So from (8,0), I have two excellent, apple-consuming options next turn.\nFrom (9,1) after RIGHT: Next moves would be DOWN (9,0) which has an apple, UP (9,2) which is empty, or LEFT (8,1) which is my body. Also two good options, one leading directly to an apple.\nFrom (8,2) after UP: This is safe but moves me away from the cluster of apples at the bottom. Less optimal for immediate growth.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe priority is to secure the (9,0) apple efficiently. Moving DOWN to (8,0) is the best choice. It positions me to have TWO apple options next turn ((7,0) and (9,0)), giving me flexibility depending on the enemy's position. Moving RIGHT first would also work, but DOWN seems more direct towards the apple cluster and keeps my pathing options very open.\n\n**Short-term Plan for Next Turns:**\nFrom (8,0), next turn I can choose between (7,0) or (9,0) for an apple. Evaluate enemy position then. Continue securing the southern apples to build a strong lead. The enemy is still small and distant.\n\nDOWN",

Both lead directly to an apple.\n\n**Enemy Snake Movement Consideration:**\nEnemy head is at (7,7). Its options:\n- UP: (7,8) \u2013 Empty.\n- DOWN: (7,6) \u2013 Empty.\n- LEFT: (6,7) \u2013 Its own body segment. **Death.**\n- RIGHT: (8,7) \u2013 Empty.\nEnemy will avoid LEFT. It is far away at (7,7). No direct interaction is possible this turn.\n\n**Decision:**\nBoth safe moves lead to an apple. Now I must choose which one to take.\n- **LEFT to (7,0):** Eats the apple there. This move puts my head next to my body at (7,1) and (8,1). Next turn, my safe moves from (7,0) will be limited. I can go UP (7,1) which is my body? No, that would be death. Let's check: If I eat the apple at (7,0), my new body will be [(7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (7,1)]. So from (7,0), UP to (7,1) is my own NEW body segment (the old tail stays). It would be suicide. The only safe move from (7,0) after eating would be LEFT to (6,0) or RIGHT to (8,0) (which is also my body now). So only LEFT to (6,0) would be safe. This is very restrictive and could lead to a trap.\n- **RIGHT to (9,0):** Eats the apple there. This move puts my head on the edge. My new body will be [(9,0), (8,0), (8,1), (7,1)]. From (9,0), my next moves would be UP (9,1) which is empty, or LEFT (8,0) which is my body. So only UP would be safe. Also restrictive, but being on the edge (9,0) with only one exit (UP) is slightly less dangerous than being internally trapped at (7,0) with only one exit (LEFT), because the edge offers a clear path along the border.\n\nHowever, there's a critical difference. After moving RIGHT to (9,0) and eating, my tail is still at (7,1). The segment behind my head is (8,0). So if I go LEFT from (9,0) next turn, I would go to (8,0), which is the segment I just vacated. In Snake rules, this is only deadly if it's the segment directly behind the head (the neck). Let me check the rule: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" The cell directly behind my head at (9,0) is (8,0). So moving LEFT from (9,0) into (8,0) WOULD be suicide because it's moving backwards into the neck. So my initial assessment is correct: from (9,0), only UP is safe.\n\nComparing the two risky positions:\n- (7,0) has one safe exit: LEFT to (6,0).\n- (9,0) has one safe exit: UP to (9,1).\n\nThe board state shows (6,0) is empty. (9,1) is also empty. Neither is immediately threatening. However, (9,1) is closer to the other apples at the top right (like (9,7)) and offers more future flexibility along the top edge. Getting trapped at (7,0) in the bottom left corner seems more dangerous long-term.\n\n**Strategic Choice:**\nI will choose **RIGHT** to (9,0). This consumes the apple and positions me to move upwards next turn, which is a less congested area of the board. The enemy is far away, so the short-term bottleneck of having only one exit is acceptable.\n\n**Short-term Plan for Next Turns:**\nFrom (9,0), the only safe move is UP to (9,1). From there, assess the board. The goal will be to navigate along the top or right edge to avoid immediate self-collision and target the apple at (9,7). The new apple at (5,0) is too far and risky to reach through my own body.\n\nRIGHT",

This is a safe, predictable move. It increases distance from the enemy, who is currently at y=6. From (9,3), my next moves would likely be UP again or LEFT.

So, while it seems to open options, it immediately puts me in a position where DOWN and RIGHT are self-collisions, leaving only UP and LEFT as potential next moves. This is potentially risky as it could lead to a dead end if not planned carefully.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMy primary goal is to get away from my own long body and the congested bottom-right corner. Moving UP along the edge is a reliable way to create space. Once I reach y=4 or y=5, I can safely turn LEFT to traverse the top of the board. The enemy is currently in the top-right area but is shorter and not an immediate threat if I keep my distance. The apples at (1,1) and (5,0) are my medium-term targets. The path to them along the top and then down the left side seems safer than engaging with the enemy near the apples at (6,7) and (6,5).\n\n**Decision:**\nBetween UP and LEFT, UP is the superior choice. It guarantees at least two safe moves next turn (likely UP and LEFT from (9,3)), whereas LEFT immediately reduces my future safe moves and places me closer to my own body trap. The plan is to continue north to create space.\n\nUP",
