They're positioned near the center-bottom of the board with good access to the apples at (7,2) and (8,3).\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\nI'm tied with the enemy at 1 apple each. I need to collect another apple quickly to maintain or gain an advantage. The closest apple to me is (1,9), which requires moving UP and then LEFT, or LEFT and then UP.\n\n**Move comparison:**\n- UP (2,9): Moves me to the top edge, gets me closer to the (1,9) apple, keeps me relatively safe\n- LEFT (1,8): Moves me toward the (1,9) apple, gets me closer to collecting it next turn\n- RIGHT (3,8): Moves me away from immediate apples, more defensive\n- DOWN (2,7): Moves me down the board, away from the (1,9) apple\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nI should continue toward the (1,9) apple to collect it and maintain my advantage. Between UP and LEFT, I should choose the direction that gets me to the apple in the fewest turns while maintaining safety.\n\n**Short-term plan:**\nMove LEFT to (1,8). This puts me directly adjacent to the (1,9) apple, which I can collect on the next turn. This move is safe and gets me closer to my goal of collecting another apple.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n**Analysis**\n\nI need to evaluate my current situation and choose the best move from (1,8).\n\n**Current state:**\n- My position: (1,8) - I'm on the top edge of the board\n- Enemy snake #1: Head at (3,2), body at (2,2)\n- I'm currently tied with the enemy at 1 apple each\n\n**Apples available:**\n- (1,9) - 1 unit up from me\n- (9,7) - 8 units right, 2 units down from me\n- (7,2) - 6 units right, 6 units down from me\n- (8,3) - 7 units right, 5 units down from me\n- (0,2) - 1 unit left, 6 units down from me\n\n**Move evaluation:**\n- UP (1,9): Safe, moves me to the (1,9) apple\n- LEFT (0,8): Safe, moves me to the left edge\n- RIGHT (2,8): Safe, moves me away from immediate apples\n- DOWN (1,7): Safe, moves me down the board\n\n**Enemy snake analysis:**\nSnake #1 at (3,2) with body at (2,2) can move:\n- UP: (3,3) - Safe\n- LEFT: (2,3) - Safe\n- RIGHT: (4,2) - Safe\n- DOWN: (3,1) - Safe\n\nAll moves are safe for the enemy.
