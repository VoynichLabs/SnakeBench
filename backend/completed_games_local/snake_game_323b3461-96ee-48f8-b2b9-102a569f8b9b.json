It has collected 0 apples.\n- Apples are at: (1,9), (6,2), (5,7), (6,4), (0,0)\n\nSince this is turn 0, it's the first move. I need to choose a direction that is safe and moves me toward an apple.\n\nPossible moves from (0,7):\n- UP: (0,8) - safe (within board, no snake there)\n- DOWN: (0,6) - safe (within board, no snake there)\n- LEFT: (-1,7) - invalid (off the board)\n- RIGHT: (1,7) - safe (within board, no snake there)\n\nSo LEFT is immediately eliminated because it would go off the board.\n\nNow, among UP, DOWN, and RIGHT, which is best?\n\nApples are at (1,9), (6,2), (5,7), (6,4), (0,0). The closest apple to me is (1,9) which is 2 steps away (right and up) or (0,0) which is 7 steps down. (5,7) is also close (5 steps right).\n\nSince I'm at (0,7), moving RIGHT to (1,7) gets me closer to (1,9) and (5,7). Moving UP to (0,8) also gets me closer to (1,9). Moving DOWN to (0,6) moves me away from most apples except (0,0), but that is far.\n\nAlso, consider the enemy snake at (9,5). It is far away and not an immediate threat.\n\nI should prioritize getting to an apple quickly. The apple at (1,9) is very close. To reach it, I need to go right and then up (or up and then right). So moving RIGHT or UP are both good.\n\nRIGHT moves me to (1,7), which is closer to (1,9) and also (5,7). UP moves me to (0,8), which is closer to (1,9) but not as directly.\n\nAlso, from (1,7), I have more options: I can go up to (1,8) or right to (2,7), etc. From (0,8), I can only go right to (1,8) or up to (0,9), which is the top edge.\n\nTo keep future options open, moving RIGHT might be better because it opens more paths.\n\nTherefore, I choose RIGHT.\n\nFinal move: RIGHT\n\nRIGHT",

The closest apples are (1,9) and (5,7). (1,9) is directly above me: 2 steps up. (5,7) is 4 steps to the right.\n\nMoving UP to (1,8) gets me closer to (1,9) - just one step away next turn. Moving RIGHT to (2,7) gets me closer to (5,7). Both are good options.\n\nAlso consider the apple at (0,0) is far, and others are at (6,2) and (6,4).\n\nSince (1,9) is very close, I should prioritize that. Moving UP is the most direct path. However, moving UP to (1,8) puts me one step below the apple, so I can eat it next turn by moving UP again.\n\nBut also consider: if I move UP to (1,8), next turn I can go UP to (1,9) to eat the apple. Alternatively, I could go RIGHT to (2,8) or LEFT to (0,8), but UP is best for the apple.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2,7) is also good, but it delays eating the immediate apple.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (9,6), which is far and not a threat yet.\n\nI should go for the closest apple to get my first growth and point.\n\nTherefore, UP is the best move to get to (1,9) quickly.\n\nShort-term plan: After eating the apple at (1,9), I'll have a body segment. Then I should avoid moving backwards into my own body. From (1,9) after eating, my body will be at (1,8). So I should not move DOWN to (1,8) next turn.

It is at x=4, so to the right.\n- (0,0) is far bottom-left.\n- (6,2) and (6,4) are bottom-right.\n- (5,7) is near top-right.\n\nClosest apple is (4,9) at same row. Moving RIGHT gets me closer to it (from x=1 to x=2, then further right). Moving LEFT goes away from it (to x=0).\n\nAlso, enemy snake #1 is at (9,8). It might move UP to (9,9) or DOWN to (9,7) or LEFT to (8,8) or RIGHT (off-board). It has no body so all moves are safe for it except possibly off-board RIGHT.\n\nI should avoid moving directly toward enemy head if possible to prevent potential head-on collisions in future. But currently enemy is far.\n\nSo both LEFT and RIGHT are safe. RIGHT moves me toward (4,9) apple and also toward other apples in right half. LEFT moves me to (0,9) which is near (0,0) apple but that is far down.\n\nAlso, after moving RIGHT to (2,9), my body will be at [(2,9), (1,9)] and tail at (1,8). Next turn I can move from (2,9) to UP (off-board), DOWN (2,8), LEFT (1,9) (my body), RIGHT (3,9). So only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. Similarly for LEFT: moving to (0,9) gives next moves: UP (off-board), DOWN (0,8), LEFT (off-board), RIGHT (1,9) (my body). So only DOWN is safe.\n\nSo RIGHT gives more options (DOWN and RIGHT) next turn, while LEFT gives only DOWN. So RIGHT is better for future mobility.\n\nTherefore, choose RIGHT.\n\n**Short-term plan:**\nAfter moving RIGHT to (2,9), aim to continue right toward (4,9) apple. Next turn from (2,9) I can go RIGHT to (3,9) or DOWN to (2,8). Prefer RIGHT to get closer to apple. Then from (3,9) I can go RIGHT to (4,9) to eat the apple. After eating, I'll have body segments and need to avoid trapping myself. Also watch enemy movement: if enemy moves toward same area, might need to avoid head-on collision.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy at (8,9) might move toward me; if it goes LEFT several moves, it could block my path down or collide head-on later.\n\nBut immediate reward and growth seem worth it: with length 3, I can use body to protect myself better.\n\n**Plan for turning after apple**: After going RIGHT to (4,9), next turn only DOWN and RIGHT safe.

          "rationale": "Let's analyze the current state:\n\n**Turn 7**\nMy snake (ID 0): Head at (4,8), Body: [(4,9), (3,9)] (length 3, since I have 2 apples collected)\nApples: (6,2), (5,7), (6,4), (0,0), (9,5)\nEnemy snake #1: Head at (6,9), no body (so length 1).\n\nFrom my head (4,8):\n- UP: (4,9) \u2192 my own body segment \u2192 deadly.\n- DOWN: (4,7) \u2192 empty (safe).\n- LEFT: (3,8) \u2192 empty (safe).\n- RIGHT: (5,8) \u2192 empty (safe).\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy threat**: Snake #1 at (6,9) can move:\n- UP: (6,10) off-board \u2192 deadly.\n- DOWN: (6,8) empty.\n- LEFT: (5,9) empty.\n- RIGHT: (7,9) off-board \u2192 deadly.\nSo enemy can go DOWN or LEFT.\n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (5,9), it is moving towards my position? I'm at (4,8). If enemy goes DOWN to (6,8), it is also moving closer to me? (6,8) is adjacent to (5,8) and (6,7), etc.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk: I'm at (4,8), enemy at (6,9) - distance: |4-6|=2 horizontally, |8-9|=1 vertically, so Manhattan distance 3.\n\n**Apples**: Closest apples are at (5,7) and (6,4). Also (9,5) and (6,2), (0,0). (5,7) is very close: from (4,8) to (5,7) is one step diagonally, so two moves away.\n\n**Future flexibility**:\n- If DOWN to (4,7): next turn body becomes [(4,8), (4,9)]? Actually, since I didn't eat an apple, my tail (3,9) is removed? Wait, my body is [(4,9), (3,9)] currently. After moving without eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves forward. So after moving DOWN to (4,7), my body becomes: head at (4,7), then (4,8), then (4,9). So next turn from (4,7):\n  - UP: (4,8) my body \u2192 deadly.\n  - DOWN: (4,6) empty.\n  - LEFT: (3,7) empty.\n  - RIGHT: (5,7) apple (safe and beneficial).\n  So 3 safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. And RIGHT leads to an apple.\n\n- If LEFT to (3,8): next turn body becomes head at (3,8), then (4,8), then (4,9). Next turn options:\n  - UP: (3,9) empty? But (3,9) is currently my tail? Actually, after moving, my tail (3,9) is gone? Wait no: when I move without eating, the tail moves away. So the body becomes [(3,8), (4,8), (4,9)]? Actually, the head moves to (3,8), then the first body segment moves to the old head (4,8), and the second to (4,9). So from (3,8):\n    - UP: (3,9) empty (safe).\n    - DOWN: (3,7) empty.\n    - LEFT: (2,8) empty.\n    - RIGHT: (4,8) my body \u2192 deadly.\n    So 3 safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT. But moving LEFT takes me away from the apples.\n\n- If RIGHT to (5,8): next turn body becomes head at (5,8), then (4,8), then (4,9). Next turn options:\n  - UP: (5,9) empty? But enemy might be there? Currently empty.\n  - DOWN: (5,7) apple (safe and beneficial).\n  - LEFT: (4,8) my body \u2192 deadly.\n  - RIGHT: (6,8) empty (but enemy might go there?).\n  So safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. And DOWN leads to an apple.\n\nSo both DOWN and RIGHT lead to positions where I can get an apple next turn (RIGHT: DOWN to (5,7); DOWN: RIGHT to (5,7)).\n\n**Enemy path**: Enemy at (6,9) might go LEFT to (5,9) or DOWN to (6,8). If it goes LEFT to (5,9), it is close to (5,8) and (5,7). If it goes DOWN to (6,8), it is close to (6,7) and (6,6). So if I go RIGHT to (5,8), I might be adjacent to enemy if it goes to (5,9). But since we move simultaneously, if I go to (5,8) and enemy goes to (5,9), we are adjacent but not colliding. However, if enemy goes to (5,9) and I go to (5,8), next turn I might be at risk if I go UP to (5,9) when enemy is there? But that would be a head-on collision.\n\nBut for this turn, going RIGHT is safe.\n\n**Best move**: I want to get the apple at (5,7). From (4,8), going RIGHT to (5,8) sets me up to go DOWN to (5,7) next turn. Going DOWN to (4,7) sets me up to go RIGHT to (5,7) next turn. Both are equally good in terms of steps to the apple.\n\nHowever, going RIGHT to (5,8) might be riskier because the enemy could go to (5,9) and be adjacent. Going DOWN to (4,7) is safer because the enemy is less likely to go to (4,7) directly? Enemy is at (6,9), so it would take two moves to reach (4,7).\n\nSo DOWN is slightly safer.\n\nAlso, going DOWN gives me more options: from (4,7) I can go RIGHT to (5,7) for the apple, or LEFT to (3,7) or DOWN to (4,6) to avoid the enemy.\n\n**Long-term plan**: After getting the apple at (5,7), I should target (6,4) next. Also, avoid the enemy which is likely to move towards the apples as well.\n\nSo for this turn, DOWN is a safe and flexible move that positions me for the apple at (5,7) next turn.\n\n**Final choice**: DOWN\n\nDOWN",

This is safe because we are not colliding (different cells). However, next turn I will have grown to length 4 (head at (5,7), body: [(4,7), (4,8), (4,9)]). Enemy will be at (5,8).

But it's risky.\n- DOWN: (5,6) empty.\n- LEFT: (4,7) my body \u2192 deadly.\n- RIGHT: (6,7) empty.\nSo only DOWN and RIGHT are safe. UP is risky because of potential head-on collision with enemy.\n\nBut since enemy is at (5,8), it can move:\n- UP: (5,9) empty? But (5,9) is now empty.\n- DOWN: (5,7) my head? But that would be deadly for enemy.\n- LEFT: (4,8) my body \u2192 deadly for enemy.\n- RIGHT: (6,8) empty.\nSo enemy can only go UP to (5,9) or RIGHT to (6,8).

Still manageable.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Apple proximity\n\nApples:  \n- Closest: (6, 4) \u2013 3 moves away (down from (6, 7) or from (5, 6)).  \n- (4, 3) \u2013 closer if I go DOWN now to (5, 6) then left/down.  \n- (9, 5) far right.  \n- (6, 2) far bottom.  \n\nGoing **RIGHT** gets me closer to (6, 4) and keeps (9, 5) accessible.  \nGoing **DOWN** gets me closer to (4, 3) and (6, 4) later.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5 \u2013 Future flexibility\n\nFrom (5, 7):  \n- **UP** to (5, 8) \u2192 next turn: can go UP (off-board \u274c), LEFT (body \u274c), RIGHT (safe), DOWN (back to 5,7 safe?) Actually DOWN goes to (5, 7) which is now empty \u2014 but check future: not terrible but limited.  \n- **DOWN** to (5, 6) \u2192 next turn: all directions open except UP back to (5, 7) possible. That\u2019s fine. More open space.  \n- **RIGHT** to (6, 7) \u2192 next turn: UP maybe risky if enemy nearby, but enemy might be at (6, 8) or (5, 9). Probably still have DOWN, RIGHT safe.\n\nRisk: enemy might cut off my path if I go RIGHT. But currently enemy is short (length 1) and won\u2019t block much.\n\n---\n\n## Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan\n\nThere\u2019s an apple at (4, 3) relatively central. Going DOWN sets me up toward that apple and keeps distance from enemy while having more open space.  \nGoing RIGHT slightly traps me along right edge with enemy above.\n\nGiven enemy movement randomness but shortest-path thinking: safer to go **DOWN** to open area and target (4, 3) next.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nDOWN",

Wait \u2014 My body at (5, 7), (4, 7), (4, 8). (5, 8) is empty. \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4, 9) \u2705 empty  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6, 9) \u2705 empty  \n\nSo enemy safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nHead-on collision risk this turn:  \nEnemy can\u2019t collide with me this turn because:  \n- My head (5,6), enemy head (5,9): not adjacent. So no overlap possible this turn.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Next turn collision risk  \nAfter my move this turn:  \nFrom my safe moves:  \n\n1. **DOWN \u2192 (5, 5)**:  \n   Next turn I\u2019ll be at (5, 5).  \n   Enemy possible positions after this turn: either (5, 8), (4, 9), or (6, 9).  \n   - Enemy at (5, 8) could move DOWN to (5, 7) next turn \u2014 not adjacent to me at (5, 5). Minimal collision risk.  \n   - Enemy at (6, 9) \u2192 moves: down to (6, 8) \u2014 not adjacent to me at (5, 5) yet.  \n   - Enemy at (4, 9) \u2192 down to (4, 8) \u2014 my old body segment (but next turn my body will be (5,6), (5,7), (4,7)) \u2014 actually (4,8) still my body? Let's check: current body: (5,7), (4,7), (4,8). So after I move to (5,5), I grow? No, didn\u2019t eat apple, so length stays 4. New body becomes: (5,6) becomes neck, (5,7) next, (4,7), tail (4,8)? Wait let's compute:  \n     Movement: head goes to new pos, each segment shifts forward:  \n     Old: head (5,6), body = [(5,7), (4,7), (4,8)]  \n     Move DOWN to (5,5):  \n     New head: (5,5)  \n     New body: [old head (5,6), old body[0] (5,7), old body[1] (4,7)] \u2014 tail (4,8) disappears.  \n     So next turn my body occupies: (5,6), (5,7), (4,7).  \n\n   So that freed up (4,8), so enemy could potentially go there without collision with my body. Actually enemy enters only if it's head movement into my body segment next turn? Maybe low risk, but not relevant here.  \n\n   Actually: important: after my move, enemy moves same turn \u2014 then we check collisions this turn? Let's see rules: collisions **this turn** happen if heads occupy same cell **after** this turn's movement. So me moving to (5,5) and enemy moving somewhere else \u2014 no collision possible this turn.  \n\n   Next turn speculation: enemy might move closer, but currently far enough that DOWN looks safe.  \n\n2. **LEFT \u2192 (4, 6)**:  \n   Next turn position: (4,6). Enemy possibly at (5,8), (4,9), (6,9).  \n   If enemy at (5,8) \u2192 could move LEFT to (4,8) adjacent to my head (4,6)? No, not adjacent.  \n   If enemy at (4,9) \u2192 could move DOWN to (4,8) or LEFT (3,9) or RIGHT (5,9). One move away still. Okay.  \n\n   But LEFT goes closer to apple (4,3) down the line. Horizontally centered.  \n\n3. **RIGHT \u2192 (6, 6)**:  \n   Moves toward apple (6,4) directly.  \n   But enemy could maybe move to (6,9) \u2192 DOWN (6,8) adjacent to my (6,6) next turn, increasing head-on risk later.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Apples and path planning  \nApples: closest are (4,3) and (6,4).  \n(4,3): path: 4,6 \u2192 4,5 \u2192 4,4 \u2192 4,3  \n(6,4): path: 6,6 \u2192 6,5 \u2192 6,4  \n\nBoth are 3 moves away.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Open space  \nFrom (5,5): can go left to (4,5), right to (6,5), down to (5,4) \u2014 all fine except maybe avoiding enemy later.  \nFrom (4,6): can go down to (4,5), left to (3,6), right to (5,6), up to (4,7) blocked by my body at (4,7)? Actually next turn body segments after moving to (4,6) would be: old head (5,6), old body[0] (5,7), old body[1] (4,7). So (4,7) is body next turn \u2014 so UP from (4,6) blocked next turn. So 3 moves safe.  \nFrom (6,6): can go down to (6,5), right to (7,6), up to (6,7), left to (5,6) \u2014 body at (5,6)? Yes, after moving to (6,6), body is (5,6), (5,7), (4,7), so left to (5,6) blocked. So also 3 moves safe.  \n\nSo all safe moves give 3 options next turn.  \n\n---\n\nGiven that enemy is north of me, moving DOWN or LEFT avoids getting pinched by it early.  \nLEFT seems good for apple (4,3), but enemy at (4,9) could move down toward that region \u2014 maybe negligible.  \n\nActually DOWN to (5,5) gives more central options next turn toward either (4,3) or (6,4), while avoiding potential trap along top.  \n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan:**  \nMove down to (5,5), then check enemy position; next turn can go left toward (4,3) or right toward (6,4) depending on enemy movement.  \n\nDOWN",

So same distance.\n\nSimilarly (4,3): from (5,5):\n   1. LEFT (4,5), DOWN (4,4), DOWN (4,3) \u2014 3 moves. Actually 3 moves yes. Slightly farther.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Choose best option\nLooking at future space:  \nRIGHT seems better than LEFT because:\n- On right side, more open space (except far right edge).\n- LEFT side: after eating (4,3) maybe blocked by left edge quickly.\n\nActually, DOWN keeps more options open next turn since I can still go left to (4,4) or right to (6,4) later.  \nBut DOWN also means I don\u2019t commit yet to one apple over the other; keeps flexibility.\n\nGiven enemy is north-west, moving DOWN creates distance.\n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**\nMove DOWN to (5,4).

(if I move here, I eat it and grow) \u2714 safe\n\nSo possible: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Immediate collision risks:**\nEnemy at (4,8) can move to: (4,9), (3,8), (5,8), (4,7) [but (4,9) is off-board? Wait, board is 0-9 so (4,9) is valid top row? Actually y=9 is top, so (4,9) is valid? But enemy is at (4,8) so UP to (4,9) is valid. So enemy moves: UP (4,9), DOWN (4,7), LEFT (3,8), RIGHT (5,8).\n\nCheck head-on collisions:\n- If I go RIGHT to (6,4): enemy cannot reach (6,4) in one move (too far). Safe.\n- If I go LEFT to (4,4): enemy cannot reach (4,4) in one move (would need to go down twice). Safe.\n- If I go DOWN to (5,3): enemy cannot reach (5,3). Safe.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision.\n\n**Apple priorities:**\nRIGHT leads directly to apple (6,4) - eating it immediately. This is highly beneficial: I gain an apple and grow (so my body becomes longer, but tail remains at (5,7) for now). Also, (6,4) is close.\n\nLEFT leads to (4,4), which is closer to apple (4,3) (one move away: DOWN from (4,4) to (4,3)).\nDOWN leads to (5,3), which is also close to (4,3) (LEFT then DOWN? Actually from (5,3), LEFT to (4,3) eats).\n\nBut RIGHT gives immediate apple.\n\n**Future safety:**\nAfter eating (6,4), my head will be at (6,4) and I grow by one (so my body will be: head (6,4), then (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7)). This leaves my tail at (5,7). Next turn, from (6,4) I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT? Check:\n- UP: (6,5) - empty? Currently empty.\n- DOWN: (6,3) - empty.\n- LEFT: (5,4) - my body? But (5,4) is now the segment behind head? Actually after eating, the body grows: the new head is at (6,4), and the old head (5,4) becomes the next segment. So (5,4) is my body. So LEFT to (5,4) would be deadly \u274c.\n- RIGHT: (7,4) - empty.\n\nSo after eating, I have 3 safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT. So good options.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (4,4), I don't eat immediately, but next turn I can go DOWN to (4,3) to eat. Similarly, if I go DOWN to (5,3), next turn LEFT to (4,3) eats.\n\nBut RIGHT gives immediate reward and is safe.\n\n**Enemy position:**\nEnemy at (4,8) is far away (Manhattan distance 6 from (5,4)), so no immediate threat. After my move, enemy might move towards center, but I'll be at (6,4) which is safe.\n\n**Best choice:**\nRIGHT gets an apple immediately and is safe. It also moves me away from the enemy. The only downside is that LEFT is blocked next turn (as explained), but I still have UP/DOWN/RIGHT options, which are sufficient.\n\nLEFT and DOWN are also safe but don't give immediate apple. So RIGHT is superior.\n\n**Final decision:**\nRIGHT\n\n(Note: After eating, my body will be longer, but that is manageable.)\n\nRIGHT",

Note that (5,7) is my tail, but if enemy moves there, it dies because it hits my body? Actually, rule: \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\" So enemy moving to (5,7) would kill itself, not me. So no direct threat to me.\n\nHead-on collisions: \n- If I go UP to (6,5): enemy cannot reach (6,5) in one move (distance 2).\n- If I go DOWN to (6,3): enemy cannot reach (6,3) (distance 3).\n- If I go RIGHT to (7,4): enemy cannot reach (7,4) (distance 3).\nSo no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n**Apple priorities:**\n- UP: (6,5) -> no apple nearby? Closest apples are (6,2) (down), (4,3) (left and down), (9,5) (right and up), (9,3) (right and down).\n- DOWN: (6,3) -> then next turn DOWN to (6,2) eats apple (6,2).\n- RIGHT: (7,4) -> then can go RIGHT towards (9,5) or (9,3), but these are farther.\n\nAlso, apple at (4,3) is close: from (6,4), going LEFT would be best but blocked. So to reach (4,3), I need to go DOWN first to (6,3), then LEFT to (5,3), then LEFT to (4,3)? That's two moves away. Alternatively, from (6,3), I can go DOWN to (6,2) to eat that apple first.\n\nSo DOWN leads to two apples: (6,2) and then (4,3).\n\nRIGHT leads to (9,5) and (9,3), but these are farther and might be contested by enemy? Enemy is at (4,7), which is far from right side.\n\n**Future safety:**\nAfter moving DOWN to (6,3):\n- Next turn from (6,3): safe moves? UP (6,4) is my body? Actually, after moving down, my body becomes: head (6,3), then (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). So UP to (6,4) is body \u274c deadly. So safe moves: DOWN (6,2) - apple!, LEFT (5,3), RIGHT (7,3). So three safe moves, including eating (6,2).\n\nAfter moving RIGHT to (7,4):\n- Next turn from (7,4): safe moves? My body: head (7,4), then (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). So LEFT to (6,4) is body \u274c deadly. So safe: UP (7,5), DOWN (7,3), RIGHT (8,4). So three safe moves.\n\nAfter moving UP to (6,5):\n- Next turn from (6,5): safe moves? Body: head (6,5), then (6,4), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). So DOWN to (6,4) is body \u274c deadly. Safe: UP (6,6), LEFT (5,5) is body? (5,5) is my body \u274c deadly, RIGHT (7,5). So only two safe moves: UP and RIGHT. This is more restrictive.\n\nSo UP is less safe for future moves.\n\n**Enemy position:**\nEnemy at (4,7) is moving. It might go towards center or apples. But currently no immediate threat.\n\n**Best choice:**\nDOWN and RIGHT both give good future options, but DOWN leads directly to an apple path (to (6,2) next turn). RIGHT moves me towards right-side apples but they are farther. Also, going DOWN avoids the enemy area (which is above).\n\nUP is less safe due to fewer future moves.\n\nSo prefer DOWN.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nAfter eating (6,2), I can consider going left to (4,3) or further. The enemy is small (no body) and might be easy to trap later. But for now, focus on eating safely.\n\nDOWN\nRIGHT",

From (7,5), I'll also have good mobility.  \n\nSince enemy is small and not threatening yet, I should focus on collecting apples efficiently.  \nUP seems less blocking \u2014 going left means I might get pinched against my long body later. But actually, checking: body is at (8,4) so (7,5) is fine for now.  \n\nLet\u2019s compute path to closest apple:  \nFrom (8,5) to apple (6,2) is Manhattan distance 5 (2 left + 3 down). Requires going left and down.  \nFrom (8,5) to apple (9,3) is 3 steps but blocked by body, so not safe yet.  \nFrom (8,5) to apple (3,6) is far.  \nFrom (8,5) to apple (2,3) is far.  \n\nActually, apple at (9,3) may be tempting if I can reach it next turn \u2014 but to get there I would need to be at (9,4) or (8,3), but both are unsafe this turn.  \n\nBetter safe path: go LEFT to (7,5), then next turn maybe go DOWN to (7,4)? Wait (7,4) is my body \u2014 yes so that's bad. So from (7,5), safe moves next turn would be UP, DOWN, LEFT \u2014 but DOWN is body, so maybe going LEFT now reduces future options.  \n\nTesting: from (7,5) next turn:  \n- UP (7,6) empty \u2705  \n- DOWN (7,4) body \u274c  \n- LEFT (6,5) empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT (8,5) empty \u2705  \nActually DOWN is blocked, others open. That's okay.  \n\nFrom (8,6) next turn:  \n- UP (8,7) empty \u2705  \n- DOWN (8,5) empty \u2705  \n- LEFT (7,6) empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT (9,6) empty \u2705  \nSo UP gives more mobility.  \n\nSince UP gives more freedom and I'm long enough to not need immediate apple, **UP** seems better for keeping options.  \n\n**Plan**: Move toward center and top-left apples eventually, but maintain flexibility. Avoid going near enemy until necessary.  \n\nUP",

No immediate head-on risk.\n\n**Apple targeting:**\nFrom (8,6):\n- Apple at (9,3): distance 4 steps.\n- Apple at (6,2): distance 6 steps.\n- Apple at (3,6): distance 5 steps.\n- Apple at (2,3): far.\n- Apple at (0,0): far.\n\nClosest promising: (9,3) and (3,6).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7,6):\nNext turn I can go DOWN toward (9,3) later via left/down path, or toward (3,6) horizontally leftward.\n\nIf I go UP to (8,7):\nNext turn, maybe go LEFT toward (3,6) possibly.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9,6):\nNext turn, going DOWN toward (9,3) is obvious \u2014 but from (9,6) to (9,3) requires passing through (9,5) my tail currently there \u2014 but tail moves forward when I move, so (9,5) will be empty next turn if I go RIGHT now? Let\u2019s check: moves happen simultaneously; tail moves when I move, so next turn my tail current position (9,5) becomes part of body? Actually, my body: head (8,6), then (8,5), then (9,5), then (9,4), etc. When I move to (9,6), tail (7,4) stays? No: let's simulate: head to (9,6), rest of body shifts: new body becomes [(9,6), (8,6), (8,5), (9,5), (9,4)], so (8,4) gone, (9,5) stays in body, so (9,5) still blocked next turn. So going from (9,6) to (9,5) next turn is impossible. So can't directly go down from (9,6) toward apple at (9,3) next turn \u2014 blocked by own body at (9,5).

Apple (6,2) is near enemy, so likely gone soon.\n\nSo maybe aim for (9,3) or (3,6).\n\n(3,6) is safer path through open area: path like (7,6) -> (6,6) -> (5,6) -> (4,6) -> (3,6) open.\n\nAlso, apple at (9,3) might be contested if enemy goes RIGHT then DOWN.\n\nSafer to go left toward apple (3,6) and control center.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Collect apple (3,6) while watching enemy. Keep distance. Enemy small, so not deadly except head-on.\n\nLEFT\n\n**Final move:**\nLEFT",

Enemy heading toward (9,0) is basically dead end near corner eventually but not immediate threat to me. Enemy at (8,1) or (9,0) is far from my position (Manhattan distance >7). No risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (3, 6) \u2014 Manhattan distance from head = |5-3| + |8-6| = 2+2=4  \n- (9, 3) \u2014 |5-9| + |8-3| = 4+5=9  \n- (2, 3), (0, 0), (2, 0) farther away.  \n\nSo best target is (3, 6).  \n\n**Path to (3, 6):**  \nFrom (5, 8) to (3, 6) requires LEFT then DOWN or DOWN then LEFT.  \n\nLEFT to (4, 8) then DOWN to (4, 7), LEFT to (3, 7), DOWN to (3, 6).  \nOr DOWN to (5, 7), LEFT to (4, 7), etc.  \n\nCheck immediate move safety vs trap avoidance:  \n\nLEFT (4, 8):  \nNext turn options from (4, 8): avoid moving RIGHT back into (5, 8) which is now body segment? Wait: next turn body will be: head at (4, 8), old head (5, 8) segment 2, then (6, 8), etc. So moving RIGHT to (5, 8) kills next turn. That leaves UP, DOWN, LEFT safe. Another apple at (2, 3) far; also can go DOWN to (4, 7) then LEFT to (3, 7) toward (3, 6).  \n\nDOWN (5, 7):  \nNear body at (6, 7), but safe since not entering it. Next turn from (5, 7): UP(5, 8) now body=death, RIGHT(6, 7) body=death; safe moves = DOWN(5, 6), LEFT(4, 7). That\u2019s restrictive.  \n\nUP (5, 9):  \nNext turn from (5, 9): DOWN(5, 8) body=death, others likely safe, but top row reduces future options slightly.  \n\nLEFT seems better for path to (3, 6) and keeping options open: LEFT\u2192 then DOWN\u2192LEFT\u2192DOWN to apple.  \n\n**Space assessment:**  \nBody blocks area around bottom right. Plenty of space on left side.  \n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nEat (3, 6): path (5,8)\u2192(4,8)\u2192(4,7)\u2192(3,7)\u2192(3,6). Avoid (9,3) because enemy might eventually go there and it\u2019s corner trap risk. After (3,6), maybe target (2,3) then (0,0). Keep enemy in mind but they are far right now.  \n\nBest immediate move: LEFT toward (3, 6) and maintains flexibility.  \n\nLEFT",

Manhattan distance to me is |3-9| + |7-2| = 6+5=11, no immediate threat.\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is (3, 6) \u2014 directly below me. Moving DOWN eats it immediately. This is highly advantageous: gain an apple and grow, and the tail doesn't advance (so body becomes longer but same segments).  \nUP or LEFT would move away from this easy apple.\n\n**Future flexibility after eating (3,6):**  \nAfter moving DOWN to (3,6) and eating apple:  \nNew head: (3,6)  \nBody becomes: [ (3,7), (4,7), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6), (7,6) ] (length 9 segments)  \nFrom (3,6):  \n- UP: (3,7) \u2192 my body \u274c (just behind head)  \n- DOWN: (3,5) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- LEFT: (2,6) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT: (4,6) \u2192 empty \u2705  \nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options). Good mobility.\n\nIf I move UP to (3,8):  \nBody becomes [ (3,7), (4,7), (4,8), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (6,6) ] (tail moves)  \nFrom (3,8):  \n- UP: (3,9) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- DOWN: (3,7) \u2192 body \u274c  \n- LEFT: (2,8) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT: (4,8) \u2192 body \u274c  \nSo only 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT).

Good, but misses immediate apple.\n\n**Collision risk:**  \nNo enemy threat.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDOWN is optimal: eat the apple at (3,6) immediately. This gains a point and grows safely, with good future mobility (3 safe moves next turn). It also avoids moving toward the enemy (right side) and keeps me on the left where more apples are ((2,3) and (2,0)).\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating (3,6), consider moving LEFT to (2,6) or DOWN to (3,5) to target (2,3) or (2,0). Avoid RIGHT toward enemy. Also note apple at (0,0) is far but could be long-term target.\n\nDOWN",

Apple (2, 0) is also below. Apples (0, 3) and (0, 0) are to the left/down.  \n\n- DOWN to (2, 4): gets me directly closer to (2, 3).  \n- LEFT to (1, 5): moves laterally toward left-side apples but away from vertical alignment with (2, 3).  \n- RIGHT to (3, 5): moves away from all current apples except maybe (6, 9), but that\u2019s far and near enemy.  \n\n**Future flexibility**:  \nFrom (2,4):  \nUP=(2,5) \u274c body (unless tail moves forward, but body currently at (2,6)), DOWN=(2,3) \u2705, LEFT=(1,4) \u2705, RIGHT=(3,4) \u2705 \u2192 3 safe moves probably (UP only if tail moves out when advancing). Actually checking: After I move head DOWN to (2,4), tail at (6,7) moves to (6,8)? Wait, no \u2014 the tail moves forward because head advances, so tail segment (6,7) becomes new position of former neck segment (6,8)? Let\u2019s recalc: head (2,5) \u2192 (2,4), body segments shift: old neck (2,6) \u2192 (2,5), (3,6)\u2192(2,6), (3,7)\u2192(3,6), (4,7)\u2192(3,7), (4,8)\u2192(4,7), (5,8)\u2192(4,8), (6,8)\u2192(5,8), tail (6,7)\u2192(6,8).  \nSo new body: [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,7), (4,7), (4,8), (5,8)], tail at (5,8). Actually that\u2019s wrong \u2014 length 9 segments? Currently length 8 segments + head = 9 total cells occupied. We start with 8 body segments after last turn's move (since we had apples=8), yes length 9 total. After moving without eating, head moves to (2,4), each body segment advances: neck moves to old head pos (2,5), next moves to old neck (2,6), etc., last body segment (tail) moves to old second-to-last body segment's position (6,8). So new body: [(2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (3,7), (4,7), (4,8), (6,8)]? Let\u2019s check carefully:  \n\nCurrent: head (2,5), body: [(2,6)b1, (3,6)b2, (3,7)b3, (4,7)b4, (4,8)b5, (5,8)b6, (6,8)b7, (6,7)b8].  \nMove head to (2,4). Next frame: head=(2,4), b1\u2192(2,5), b2\u2192(2,6), b3\u2192(3,6), b4\u2192(3,7), b5\u2192(4,7), b6\u2192(4,8), b7\u2192(5,8), b8\u2192(6,8). Yes tail is at (6,8).  \n\nSo from new head (2,4): UP=(2,5) \u274c body (b1 now there), DOWN=(2,3)\u2705, LEFT=(1,4)\u2705, RIGHT=(3,4)\u2705 \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nFrom (1,5) after LEFT: new body: head (1,5), b1\u2192(2,5), b2\u2192(2,6), b3\u2192(3,6), b4\u2192(3,7), b5\u2192(4,7), b6\u2192(4,8), b7\u2192(5,8), b8\u2192(6,8). Check moves from (1,5): UP=(1,6)\u2705, DOWN=(1,4)\u2705, LEFT=(0,5)\u2705, RIGHT=(2,5)\u274c body \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nFrom (3,5) after RIGHT: similar symmetry: UP=(3,6)\u2705? Wait old b3 is (3,6) but moves to (2,6) before our check. Let\u2019s compute: b1\u2192(2,5), b2\u2192(2,6), b3\u2192(3,6) actually yes still a body segment at (3,6) because b3 starts at (3,6), moves to (3,6)? No current b2 is (3,6), b3 is (3,7). Let\u2019s recompute carefully: Current: (2,5)H, (2,6)b1, (3,6)b2, (3,7)b3, (4,7)b4, (4,8)b5, (5,8)b6, (6,8)b7, (6,7)b8.  \n\nRIGHT to (3,5): new head(3,5), b1\u2192(2,5), b2\u2192(2,6), b3\u2192(3,6), b4\u2192(3,7), b5\u2192(4,7), b6\u2192(4,8), b7\u2192(5,8), b8\u2192(6,8).  \n\nFrom (3,5)\u2019s perspective: UP=(3,6)\u274c body (b3 there), DOWN=(3,4)\u2705, LEFT=(2,5)\u274c body (b1 there), RIGHT=(4,5)\u2705 \u2192 only 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT). So RIGHT is worse.  \n\n**Collision risk**: Enemy head (8,2) likely going for apples (0,3) or (2,3) possibly. Could move LEFT or DOWN then LEFT. Still far but worth noting I\u2019m racing for (2,3).  \n\n**Decision**: DOWN is optimal: direct path to apple (2,3), maintains flexibility, better than RIGHT. LEFT also good but less direct.  \n\n**Plan for next turns**:  \nAfter moving DOWN to (2,4), next turn go DOWN to (2,3) to eat apple and grow, unless enemy appears heading there \u2014 then maybe avoid head-on.  \n\nDOWN",
