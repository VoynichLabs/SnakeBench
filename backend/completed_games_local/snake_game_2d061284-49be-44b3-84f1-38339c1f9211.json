Both moves maintain connectivity to the tail.\n\nStrategy plan: Move RIGHT to align with the x=7 column, setting up access to the cluster of apples in the top right.\n\nRIGHT",

Eating this apple extends my reach towards the left side apples (0, 6, 0, 9).

Distance to apple (6, 4) reduces from 3 to 2. From (5, 5), I have 3 safe follow-up moves: DOWN (5, 4), LEFT (4, 5), and RIGHT (6, 5).\n\n3. **LEFT to (4, 6):** Safe move. However, distance to apple (6, 4) increases to 4. From (4, 6), I'd have 3 safe follow-up moves but I'm moving away from the closest apple.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (6, 6):** Safe move. Distance to apple (6, 4) reduces to 2. However, from (6, 6), I only have 2 safe follow-up moves: DOWN (6, 5) and RIGHT (7, 6). UP to (6, 7) would hit my body, and LEFT to (5, 6) would be backwards.\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nEnemy at (8, 7) is constrained - they can only go DOWN to (8, 6) or RIGHT to (9, 7). UP to (8, 8) is their own body, and LEFT to (7, 7) is my body. They're effectively trapped in the top-right corner.\n\n**Strategic Decision:**\nDOWN to (5, 5) is optimal because:\n- It gets me closest to the nearest apple (6, 4), reachable in 2 more moves (RIGHT then DOWN)\n- It provides the best future flexibility (3 safe follow-up moves vs 2 for RIGHT)\n- It positions me away from the trapped enemy in the top-right\n- Maintains central positioning for accessing other apples like (7, 0) and (9, 2) later\n\nPlan: Continue toward apple at (6, 4) via (6, 5), then reassess based on which new apples appear and enemy movement.\n\nDOWN",

Length is 8. Last move I ate an apple, so I grew.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (9, 5). Body along the top-right edge. They pose no immediate threat.\n*   **Apples:** The nearest apples are at (7, 2), (9, 2), and (7, 0) in the bottom-right quadrant. (7, 2) is the closest, Manhattan distance 3.\n*   **Board:** Row 3 (y=3) is completely empty. Row 4 (y=4) contains my body at (5, 4).\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1.  **LEFT to (5, 4):** This cell contains my neck (the first segment of my body). **Lethal.**\n2.  **UP to (6, 5):** Moves away from the apples at y=2. Safe, but strategically poor as it goes towards the top of the board where the enemy is.\n3.  **RIGHT to (7, 4):** Moves towards the target apples at x=7. However, this moves me closer to the right wall and the enemy snake's territory (x=8,9).\n4.  **DOWN to (6, 3):** Moves into Row 3, which is completely empty. This reduces the distance to the apples at (7, 2) and (7, 0) from 3 to 2. It maintains a safety buffer column (column 6) between me and the enemy, and offers maximum maneuverability in the open space of the lower board.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving DOWN is the optimal play. It safely navigates into open space, makes direct progress towards the nearest cluster of apples, and avoids the slight pressure of the enemy's side of the board.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (6, 3). From there, proceed towards the apple at (7, 2), likely via a RIGHT move next turn if the path remains clear.\n\nDOWN",

Occupies the far right edge.\n*   **Apples:** There is a cluster of apples on the left side ((0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 9)). There are also two apples in column 7: (7, 0) and (7, 4).\n*   **Opportunity:** I am equidistant from the apples at (7, 0) and (7, 4). However, the bottom row (y=0) is completely open from x=0 to x=9, making it a safe highway to the left side of the board where the apple density is highest. The area around (7, 4) is tighter, bordered by my own body and the enemy's proximity.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n1.  **LEFT to (6, 2):** This is my own neck. **Lethal.**\n2.  **RIGHT to (8, 2):** Moves towards the enemy snake at (9, 2). Risk of head-on collision if enemy moves left. Generally unsafe and puts me in a cramped corner.\n3.  **UP to (7, 3):** Safe, but moves towards (7, 4), which is adjacent to my body at (6, 4) and the enemy's zone. This restricts movement options after eating.\n4.  **DOWN to (7, 1):** Safe. Moves directly towards the apple at (7, 0). This positions me to sweep along the bottom edge towards the rich apple cluster on the left. This path is more open and offers better long-term positioning.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving DOWN is the best strategic move. It secures a path to the (7, 0) apple and subsequently the open bottom row, avoiding the congestion of the center/right side.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (7, 1). Next turn, move DOWN to (7, 0) to eat the apple. From there, move LEFT along the bottom edge to access the apples at x=0.\n\nDOWN",

There is a vertical line of apples at (0, 5) and (0, 6) that I can harvest efficiently by continuing to move up. The opponent is on the right side of the board (head at 5, 4), so hugging the left wall maximizes distance and minimizes collision risk.

In Snake, moving into your own body results in an immediate loss, as the head crashing into the body is a terminal condition [cs61c.org](https://cs61c.org/sp25/projects/proj1/). This move is forbidden.\n2.  **LEFT:** Moving to (-1, 5) takes the snake outside the boundaries of the board (x < 0). Standard game rules state that moving off the game board ends the game [medium.com](https://medium.com/@balbirms/how-i-developed-the-snake-game-in-python-2025-9853a7d7e26f). This move is forbidden.\n3.  **RIGHT:** Moving to (1, 5) moves the snake into open space. While this avoids immediate collisions, it abandons the \"wall-hugging\" strategy which simplifies navigation and minimizes risk. It also moves away from the cluster of apples located on the left edge [workshops.hackclub.com/python_snake/](https://workshops.hackclub.com/python_snake/).\n4.  **UP:** Moving to (0, 6) places the head on an apple. This grants an immediate point (raising score to 11) and causes the snake to grow. Crucially, it maintains the snake's position on the left wall (x=0), creating a safe corridor towards the next apple at (0, 9). The enemy snake is currently at (4, 5), posing no threat to this position.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe optimal strategy is to continue moving **UP**. This secures the immediate apple at (0, 6) and positions the snake to easily collect the apple at (0, 9). Sticking to the wall limits the angles from which the opponent can attack and keeps the path deterministic and safe.\n\nUP",

Let me analyze the four possible moves:\n\n1.  **UP**: Moving to (1, 10) would place my head outside the board boundaries (y-coordinate must be 0-9). This results in death.\n2.  **LEFT**: Moving to (0, 9) would place my head on the cell occupied by my own neck (the segment immediately behind my head). This is a backwards move and results in death.\n3.  **DOWN**: Moving to (1, 8) is valid within the board and is not currently occupied by my body. However, the enemy snake (Head at 1, 5) is forced to move downwards (to 1, 4) due to board constraints and body position. Moving down into the same column (x=1) as the enemy snake increases the risk of collision or getting trapped near it.\n4.  **RIGHT**: Moving to (2, 9) is within bounds. The cell (2, 9) is empty (not occupied by my body or the enemy's body). The enemy snake is moving away from this area (downwards at x=1). This move is safe and keeps me separated from the opponent.\n\n**Strategy:**\nMoving RIGHT to (2, 9) is the optimal choice. It allows me to continue traversing the top edge of the board, keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake which is contained in the lower-left area. This path positions me to eventually target the apples on the right side of the board, specifically (3, 7) and (7, 7), without engaging in risky conflicts.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving away from the wall limits future maneuverability.\n*   **Moving RIGHT to `(9, 9)`**: This moves into the top-right corner. This is a classic perimeter strategy. Column 9 (x=9) is completely empty of any snakes. From `(9, 9)`, I have a clear, straight path down the entire right edge of the board.\n    *   This path leads directly to the apple at `(9, 4)` and subsequently to the apple at `(9, 1)`.\n    *   It is the safest possible route, far away from the enemy snake (who is around y=1) and my own tail.\n    *   It secures a steady stream of apples for the next ~10 turns without risk of trapping myself.\n\nGiven the tie in score (14-14) and the abundance of turns remaining, the safest and most strategic play is to secure the empty corridor on the right edge.\n\n**Plan**\nMove RIGHT to `(9, 9)`. Then proceed down the right edge: `(9, 8)`, `(9, 7)`, etc., to collect the apples at `(9, 4)` and `(9, 1)`.\n\nRIGHT",

However, from `(7, 8)`, I am immediately constricted: `(7, 9)` is my body, and `(8, 8)` will be my neck. This leaves only LEFT or DOWN as viable follow-up moves.\n- **DOWN**: Moves to `(8, 7)`. This square is empty. From `(8, 7)`, I have more freedom. `(8, 8)` will be my neck, but `(7, 7)` is an apple, `(9, 7)` is empty, and `(8, 6)` is empty. Moving DOWN sets up an immediate path to the apple at `(7, 7)` and then `(6, 7)`, clearing the top-right area.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe move **DOWN** is safer and offers better strategic positioning. It avoids the constriction of moving left, opens up more exit paths for the next turn, and lines up a clear route to collect the apples in row 7.\n\n**Plan**\nMove DOWN to `(8, 7)`. On the next turn, move LEFT to `(7, 7)` to eat the apple, then continue towards `(6, 7)`.\n\nDOWN",

Moving here would result in immediate death. **Invalid**.\n2.  **UP** to `(7, 8)`: This cell is empty. However, analyzing the neighbors of `(7, 8)` reveals `(7, 9)` and `(8, 8)` are my body, and `(7, 7)` would be my neck. This leaves only `(6, 8)` as a valid next move. Moving UP creates a \"chimney\" or dead-end scenario with only one exit, which limits future options and risks trapping me. While not immediately fatal, it is strategically poor.\n3.  **DOWN** to `(7, 6)`: This cell is empty. It leads to the open area below my body. From `(7, 6)`, I would have access to `(6, 6)`, `(8, 6)`, and `(7, 5)`. This is a very safe and flexible move.\n4.  **LEFT** to `(6, 7)`: This cell contains an **apple**. Moving here allows me to eat it, increasing my score to 16 (tying the opponent).\n    *   After eating, my head will be at `(6, 7)`.\n    *   My neck will be at `(7, 7)`, blocking the Right direction.\n    *   My body at `(6, 9)` blocks the Up direction in 2 steps, but `(6, 8)` is currently empty.\n    *   Crucially, from `(6, 7)`, I can move **DOWN** to `(6, 6)`. `(6, 6)` is empty and connects to the open lower board.\n    *   Moving LEFT provides an immediate point and puts me in a position to easily escape to the open space `(6, 6)` on the following turn.\n\nComparing **DOWN** (no apple) vs **LEFT** (apple): Both lead to the open space around `(6, 6)` in the subsequent turn. However, LEFT secures a point and ties the score. There is no immediate danger of collision with the enemy, who is at `(9, 5)` and likely occupied with the apple at `(9, 7)` (which is likely a trap for them as my body is at `(9, 8)`).\n\nTherefore, the optimal move is **LEFT** to collect the apple and then navigate down.\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to `(6, 7)` to eat the apple. Next turn, move DOWN to `(6, 6)` to access the open space and loop around my body towards the remaining apples.\n\nLEFT",

As established in previous turns, moving into my own neck is considered a collision and is invalid.\n2.  **RIGHT** to `(7, 6)`: This cell is currently empty. However, the enemy snake's head is at `(7, 5)`. If the enemy moves **UP** to `(7, 6)` on the same turn I move **RIGHT**, our heads will collide, and we will both die. Given the score is tied (16-16), a draw is not the optimal outcome if I can win. Furthermore, this move takes me away from the closest apple.\n3.  **DOWN** to `(6, 5)`: This cell is empty. The enemy head at `(7, 5)` cannot move LEFT (into its own neck), so a head-on collision here is impossible. However, moving down takes me to `y=5`, while the closest apple is at `(2, 6)` (same row, `y=6`). Moving down creates a detour.\n4.  **LEFT** to `(5, 6)`: This cell is empty. It is safe from any immediate body collisions. It is also safe from head-on collisions because the enemy head is too far away to reach this square in one move.\n\nComparing the safe moves:\n*   **DOWN** to `(6, 5)` is safe but inefficient relative to the apple at `(2, 6)`.\n*   **LEFT** to `(5, 6)` is safe and moves me directly towards the apple at `(2, 6)`. Row 6 appears clear of obstacles from `x=6` down to at least `x=2`. This provides a straight path to the food.\n\nTherefore, moving **LEFT** is the safest and most strategic choice to increase my score.\n\nLEFT",

While eating it gives me +1 point (19 total), moving here places my head adjacent to my tail at (4, 7) and my new neck at (2, 7). Because I would grow, my tail would not move away next turn, meaning my only safe exit from (3, 7) would be UP to (3, 8).

It keeps me away from the enemy snake head at (2, 5). If the enemy moves UP next turn, they will collide with my body segment shifting into (2, 6), resulting in their death.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (2, 8), I have three open paths: LEFT to (1, 8), UP to (2, 9), and RIGHT to (3, 8). This flexibility is crucial for controlling the board.\n    *   **Apple Access:** By moving UP, I position myself to loop around and eat the apple at (3, 7) on a subsequent turn (e.g., moving Right to (3, 8) then Down to (3, 7)), or to target the apple at (9, 7) if the opportunity arises. Taking the apple immediately at (3, 7) is tempting but offers lower strategic value than maintaining board control.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The move UP maximizes my survival chances and keeps my maneuverability high, forcing the enemy to react to my positioning rather than me reacting to a tight corner.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (2, 8) to control the top-left space and threaten the enemy's path.\n\nUP",

It moves me towards the open space in the top-left quadrant of the board (Rows 8-9, Cols 0-3).\n    *   **DOWN (to 2, 7):** This cell contains my own neck. Moving here is instant suicide.\n    *   **LEFT (to 1, 7):** This cell is empty and safe, but it moves me towards the left wall and away from the cluster of apples in the top-right and center-right.\n    *   **RIGHT (to 3, 7):** This cell contains an apple. While eating it gives me +1 point (19 total), moving here places my head adjacent to my tail at (4, 7) and my new neck at (2, 7). Because I would grow, my tail would not move away next turn, meaning my only safe exit from (3, 7) would be UP to (3, 8). This restricts my movement significantly and creates a risk of getting trapped if (3, 8) becomes contested or blocked.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Strategy:**\n    *   **Safety:** Moving UP to (2, 8) is the safest option. It keeps me away from the enemy snake head at (2, 5). If the enemy moves UP next turn, they will collide with my body segment shifting into (2, 6), resulting in their death.\n    *   **Future Options:** From (2, 8), I have three open paths: LEFT to (1, 8), UP to (2, 9), and RIGHT to (3, 8). This flexibility is crucial for controlling the board.\n    *   **Apple Access:** By moving UP, I position myself to loop around and eat the apple at (3, 7) on a subsequent turn (e.g., moving Right to (3, 8) then Down to (3, 7)), or to target the apple at (9, 7) if the opportunity arises. Taking the apple immediately at (3, 7) is tempting but offers lower strategic value than maintaining board control.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The move UP maximizes my survival chances and keeps my maneuverability high, forcing the enemy to react to my positioning rather than me reacting to a tight corner.\n\nPlan: Move UP to (2, 8) to control the top-left space and threaten the enemy's path.\n\nUP",

Moving here is instant suicide.\n    *   **RIGHT (to 4, 9):** This cell is empty.

Moving DOWN places me directly above it.\n    *   **Efficiency:** From (3, 8), I can move DOWN to (3, 7) on the next turn to eat the apple. This is a 2-turn sequence versus a 4+ turn sequence if I go RIGHT.\n    *   **Safety:** The enemy snake is at (0, 4) and poses no immediate threat. My own body does not obstruct (3, 8) or the path to (3, 7).\n    *   **Space Management:** Moving DOWN keeps me in the central area of the board, away from the enemy snake which is currently occupying the right edge and the row y=5. Staying central reduces the risk of being trapped against the enemy's long body.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The move DOWN maximizes scoring efficiency by securing the nearest apple in the shortest time. It maintains safe distance from the opponent and keeps my mobility options open in the less crowded center/left sectors.\n\nPlan: Move DOWN to (3, 8) to position myself for an immediate apple capture at (3, 7) next turn.\n\nDOWN",

From there, I could move RIGHT to (5, 8) or possibly UP to (4, 9) if my body moves away.\n\n- **RIGHT to (5, 7):** Positions me slightly to the right. From there, I could move UP to (5, 8) next turn.\n\nLooking at the available apples, the closest one is at (9, 7), which is 5 cells to the right from my current position. Moving RIGHT puts me on a direct path toward that apple.\n\nAdditionally, from (5, 7), my next move would likely be UP to (5, 8), which keeps me moving toward the upper-right portion of the board where several apples are located.\n\n**Strategy for future moves:**\nAfter this move, I should continue toward the apple at (9, 7). From there, I can assess the board state and determine which apple to target next, always keeping an eye on my own body to avoid getting trapped.\n\nBased on the analysis, RIGHT is the optimal move that keeps me safe while positioning me to eat the apple at (9, 7).\n\nRIGHT",

I must focus on the apple at (9, 7) in my territory.\n\n**Move Analysis from (5, 8):**\n1.  **DOWN to (5, 7):** My neck is located at (5, 7). Moving down would cause a collision with my own body. **Unsafe.**\n2.  **LEFT to (4, 8):** This square is empty (`.`). However, moving left takes me away from the apple at (9, 7) and towards my own body segments clustered around (3, 8). It reduces my maneuverability. Safe, but suboptimal.\n3.  **UP to (5, 9):** This square is empty (`.`). Moving up puts me in the top corridor. While safe, it increases the distance to the apple at (9, 7).\n4.  **RIGHT to (6, 8):** This square is empty (`.`). Moving right aligns my X-coordinate with the apple (9, 7) and moves me towards the open space in the top-right corner. **Safe and optimal.**\n\n**Path Planning to (9, 7):**\n- The path along Row 8 (Right, Right, Right, Down) is the most direct route to the apple.\n- My body currently occupies (8, 8) and (9, 8).\n- My tail is located at (9, 9).\n- As I move Right, my tail will shift, clearing (9, 8) and then (8, 8) just before I need to enter those squares. This synchronization allows me to safely traverse the path to the apple without collision.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving RIGHT is the safest and most strategic move to secure the only accessible apple and maintain my lead.\n\nPlan:\nMove RIGHT along Row 8 towards the apple at (9, 7). Follow the path (6, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (8, 8) -> (9, 8) -> (9, 7). The tail will clear the occupied squares just in time.\n\nRIGHT",

The enemy snake (ID 0) has constructed a solid wall of body segments along Row 5 (y=5), effectively splitting the board into two separate zones. This wall acts as a static obstacle, similar to the \"immovable obstacles\" described in the [snake.wits.ai](https://snake.wits.ai/docs) documentation. Consequently, the apples located in the bottom half\u2014(7, 1), (8, 2), (4, 1), and (6, 0)\u2014are inaccessible. My only immediate target is the apple at **(9, 7)**.\n\n**Move Selection:**\nFrom my current position (6, 8), I evaluate the four cardinal directions:\n1.  **DOWN (to 6, 7):** This square contains a segment of my own body. Moving here would result in a self-collision and death.\n2.  **LEFT (to 5, 8):** This is my \"neck\" segment. Moving backwards is an illegal move that causes death.\n3.  **UP (to 6, 9):** This square is empty. Moving here is safe but creates a longer path to the target apple (6, 9) -> (7, 9) -> (8, 9) -> (9, 9) -> (9, 8) -> (9, 7).\n4.  **RIGHT (to 7, 8):** This square is empty. This is the most direct route to the apple at (9, 7).\n\n**Path Safety & Mechanics:**\nThe direct path along Row 8 requires moving through squares currently occupied by my tail: (8, 8) and (9, 8). However, as explained in tutorials like the one at [kosbie.net](https://www.kosbie.net/cmu/fall-10/15-110/handouts/snake/snake.html), the snake moves by advancing the head and retracting the tail. Since I am not eating an apple this turn, my tail will move forward, vacating these squares just as my head needs to occupy them.\n-   **Turn 78:** Move RIGHT to (7, 8). Tail retracts from (9, 8).\n-   **Turn 79:** Move RIGHT to (8, 8). Tail retracts from (8, 7). (Head moves into where the tail was).\n-   **Turn 80:** Move RIGHT to (9, 8).\n-   **Turn 81:** Move DOWN to (9, 7) to eat the apple.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **RIGHT** is the optimal strategic move. It safely advances toward the only accessible apple, maintains my lead, and leverages the snake's movement mechanics to navigate through the space currently occupied by my own tail.\n\nPlan:\nMove RIGHT along Row 8. The tail will clear the path ahead, allowing access to the apple at (9, 7).\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

However, it moves me away from the nearest apple at (9, 7), which would require a longer path (Right to (9, 9), then Down twice).\n- **DOWN (8, 7):** This is occupied by my own tail segment. Fatal if I move here.\n- **LEFT (7, 8):** This is my neck segment (part of my own body). Fatal if I move here.\n- **RIGHT (9, 8):** This cell is empty and safe. It brings me closer to the apple at (9, 7), which I can reach in just one more move (Down to (9, 7)).\n\n**Enemy Consideration:**\nThe enemy snake is far from my current position and its head is at (4, 0). There's no immediate threat of a head-on collision in the top-right area where I'm located.\n\n**Move Selection:**\nMoving **RIGHT** is the optimal choice.

Moving here would result in a self-collision. **Eliminate.**\n*   **RIGHT (to 10, 1):** The board width is 10 (indices 0-9).

Moving into an enemy's body results in elimination. **Eliminate.**\n*   **DOWN (to 9, 0):** Checking the board state, cell (9, 0) is empty ('.'). There are no obstacles or snakes there. This is a safe move. It also positions me closer to the apple at (6, 0), though I will need to navigate around the enemy's body on the bottom rows in future turns.\n\n**2.

Moving to x=10 is out of bounds, resulting in death.\n3.  **DOWN**: Moving to (9, -1). The board y-coordinate ranges from 0 to 9. Moving to y=-1 is out of bounds, resulting in death.\n4.  **LEFT**: Moving to (8, 0). Checking the board state, this cell is empty ('.'). It is not occupied by my body (my body is at x=9 and x=5-3), nor by the enemy snake (the enemy's closest body part in that column is at (8, 1)). It is within the board boundaries. This move is safe.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThree of the four moves result in immediate death. Moving **LEFT** to (8, 0) is the only option that keeps me alive. This position also puts me on a trajectory towards the apple at (6, 0).\n\n**Plan for next turns**: Head left along the bottom row to reach the apple at (6, 0). Be mindful of the enemy snake's body segments occupying (1, 0) through (4, 0), which block access to the apple at (0, 0).\n\nLEFT",

It is not occupied by any snake. It is within the board. This move is safe and gains a point.\n\nThree of the four moves result in immediate death.

Its body segments occupy a significant portion of the board, notably including **(5, 1)** (directly above me) and **(4, 0)** (directly to my left).\n\n**Evaluation of Possible Moves:**\n\n1.  **DOWN:** This would move my head to **(5, -1)**. This coordinate is outside the 10x10 board boundaries (y must be 0-9). Moving off the board results in death.\n    *   **Result:** Death.\n\n2.  **RIGHT:** This would move my head to **(6, 0)**. My own body occupies this cell (it is my neck). Moving into my own body results in death. Additionally, moving directly backwards (I just moved LEFT from (6,0) to (5,0)) is a forbidden move.\n    *   **Result:** Death.\n\n3.  **LEFT:** This would move my head to **(4, 0)**. The enemy snake's body currently occupies this cell (confirmed by both the body list and the board state 'T'). Moving into an enemy's body results in death. While bodies move simultaneously, (4,0) is not the enemy's tail (which is at (2,5)), so the cell will remain occupied by the shifting body.\n    *   **Result:** Death.\n\n4.  **UP:** This would move my head to **(5, 1)**. The enemy snake's body currently occupies this cell (confirmed by the body list and board state 'T'). Moving into an enemy's body results in death. This segment is also not the tail, so it will remain occupied.\n    *   **Result:** Death.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI am completely trapped with no safe moves. Every cardinal direction leads to immediate death:\n- UP and LEFT lead to Enemy Body.\n- RIGHT leads to Own Body.\n- DOWN leads to a Wall.\n\nIn this forced situation where no move preserves survival, I must select a direction. Moving **UP** is the most \"constructive\" attempt to navigate the board, even though it is fatal here.\n\nUP",
