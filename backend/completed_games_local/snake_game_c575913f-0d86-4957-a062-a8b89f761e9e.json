Moving towards it requires moving LEFT and UP.\n\nMy current position is (5, 5). My body is empty, so the only move that constitutes hitting myself is moving backwards (DOWN to (5, 4), as (5, 6) is UP, (4, 5) is LEFT, (6, 5) is RIGHT). Since my body is empty, going DOWN to (5, 4) is safe initially, because my previous location is not part of my body yet (only the head exists). However, the rule states: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" Since I have no body, there is no cell directly behind my head that is part of my body (which would be (5, 4) if my last move was UP to (5, 5)). Since this is Turn 0, my snake just started at (5, 5), and there is no \"behind\" cell to worry about yet, as the game rules state the list is head-to-tail and my list is just (5, 5). For simplicity and standard Snake mechanics, the tile immediately preceding the head's current position is usually considered the tail/last segment, but here the body is explicitly \"none\". If I move DOWN to (5, 4), subsequently my position will be (5, 4) and my body will be [(5, 5)]. If I move UP to (5, 6), subsequently my position will be (5, 6) and my body will be [(5, 5)]. In the first turn, all moves are safe regarding self-collision based on the body list, as there are no prior body segments.\n\nEnemy snake #0 is at (1, 2). If I move:\n1. UP to (5, 6): Enemy moves to (1, 3) or (0, 2) or (2, 2) or (1, 1). Since the enemy has no body, all their moves are safe unless they collide with me or an apple. My new head position (5, 6) is safe from the enemy head (1, 2) moving into it.\n2. DOWN to (5, 4): Enemy moves. Safe from collision.\n3. LEFT to (4, 5): Enemy moves. Safe from collision.\n4. RIGHT to (6, 5): Enemy moves. Safe from collision.\n\nSince the closest apple is (3, 6), the best combination is moving towards it: LEFT/UP.\n\nOption: UP $\\to$ (5, 6). Distance to (3, 6) is $\\sqrt{2^2 + 0^2} = 2$.\nOption: LEFT $\\to$ (4, 5). Distance to (3, 6) is $\\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41$.\n\nMoving LEFT seems geometrically better to close the gap to (3, 6).\n\nLet's analyze the consequences of moving LEFT to (4, 5):\nNew Position: (4, 5). Body: [(5, 5)].\nEnemy Snake #0 at (1, 2).\n\nIf I move LEFT: My head is at (4, 5).\nIf Snake #0 moves UP: Head at (1, 3). (Apple A4 is at (1, 3), so Snake #0 eats it if it moves UP).\nIf Snake #0 moves RIGHT: Head at (2, 2).\nIf Snake #0 moves LEFT: Head at (0, 2).\nIf Snake #0 moves DOWN: Head at (1, 1).\n\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (1, 3), it eats an apple. This is a reasonable threat.\n\nIf I move UP to (5, 6):\nNew Position: (5, 6). Body: [(5, 5)].\nDistance to (3, 6) is 2.\n\nIf I move towards the apple (3, 6), I need to move LEFT and UP. Since only one move is possible, I choose the move that best sets up the next turn.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 5), next turn I can move UP to (4, 6) which is adjacent to (3, 6).\nIf I move UP to (5, 6), next turn I can move LEFT to (4, 6) which is adjacent to (3, 6).\n\nBoth paths lead very close to the apple in 2 turns total.\n\nLet's check space constraints. The board is large (10x10) and no other snakes are nearby or blocking access.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 5), I position myself to move UP next (to (4, 6)), which is adjacent to the apple at (3, 6).\nIf Snake #0 moves towards me or an apple. Say Snake #0 moves UP to (1, 3) eating an apple.\n\nIf I move UP to (5, 6), next turn I move LEFT to (4, 6), adjacent to the apple at (3, 6).\nIf Snake #0 moves UP to (1, 3) eating an apple.\n\nSince the target apple (3, 6) is slightly \"up and left\" relative to (5, 5), a move that increases Y coordinate (UP) and decreases X coordinate (LEFT) is favored. Since I must choose one, I should prioritize the dimension that gets me closer based on Euclidean distance or better alignment.\nTarget (3, 6). Current (5, 5). Difference (-2 X, +1 Y).\n\nLEFT reduces X by 1 (to 4). Distance to target X (3) reduces from 2 spaces to 1 space.\nUP increases Y by 1 (to 6). Distance to target Y (6) reduces from 1 space to 0 spaces.\n\nMoving UP achieves the target Y coordinate immediately, while moving LEFT achieves the target X coordinate (in terms of relative distance parity) in 1 move.\n\nIf I move UP to (5, 6): I need 1 LEFT move to reach (4, 6), which allows for the final approach to (3, 6) next turn. (Total 2 moves to reach adjacency).\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 5): I need 1 UP move to reach (4, 6), which allows for the final approach to (3, 6) next turn. (Total 2 moves to reach adjacency).\n\nBoth directions seem equally good regarding proximity to A1=(3, 6) in 2 turns.\n\nI prefer UP (5, 6) because it moves me away from the lower-left quadrant where Snake #0 is located (1, 2), potentially keeping paths clearer if I needed to head that way later, and it keeps me slightly higher on the board.\n\nStrategy Note: Prioritize moving towards the closest apple (3, 6) using a path that maintains safety and general board mobility. Moving UP seems marginally better for maintaining a higher position.\n\nMove: UP\nTurn: 1 / 150\nApple A1: (3, 6) Distance |5-3|=2, |5-6|=1. Target (5, 6) reduces distance to (2, 0).\nIf my next move is LEFT, I reach (4, 6), distance to A1 is 1.\nIf I move LEFT first, I reach (4, 5), distance to A1 is $\\sqrt{1^2+1^2} = \\sqrt{2}$. Next move UP reaches (4, 6).\n\nSince UP immediately satisfies the Y requirement for the closest apple (3, 6) by reaching Y=6, I will choose UP.\n\nUP",

Distance from (5, 6) is $\\sqrt{(5-3)^2 + (6-6)^2} = 2$ (Move LEFT).\nNext nearest: (9, 4). Distance: $\\sqrt{(5-9)^2 + (6-4)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 4} = \\sqrt{20} \\approx 4.47$.\nNext nearest: (2, 7).

My best move should aim towards (3, 6) by moving LEFT.\n\n**Checking Safety for move LEFT to (4, 6):**\n\n1.  **Board Boundaries:** (4, 6) is safe (0 <= 4, 6 <= 9).\n2.  **Self-Collision:** My body is [(5, 5)]. Moving LEFT to (4, 6) puts my new head adjacent to my tail segment (5, 5). This is safe. Moving backwards would be DOWN to (5, 5), which is into my body segment, but I am moving LEFT.\n3.  **Enemy Collision Risk:** Snake #0 head is at (1, 3). If I move LEFT to (4, 6), the enemy moves one step from (1, 3).\n    *   If Snake #0 moves UP to (1, 4). Safe.\n    *   If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (1, 2). Into its own body segment [(1, 2)]? No, the body list is head-to-tail, so [(1, 2)] means the piece directly behind the head (1, 3) is (1, 2). If Snake #0 moves DOWN to (1, 2), it crashes into its own body/tail segment. **Therefore, Snake #0 cannot move DOWN.**\n    *   If Snake #0 moves LEFT to (0, 3). Safe.\n    *   If Snake #0 moves RIGHT to (2, 3). Safe.\n\nSince the enemy cannot move DOWN into its own body segment (1, 2), the enemy has three safe outgoing moves: (1, 4), (0, 3), (2, 3). None of these land on my new head position (4, 6).\n4.  **Enemy Hitting My Body:** My body is [(5, 5)]. None of the enemy's potential new positions (1, 4), (0, 3), (2, 3) are (5, 5). Safe.\n5.  **Head-on Collision:** My new position (4, 6) is not equal to any of the enemy's potential new positions. Safe.\n\nMove LEFT to (4, 6) is safe and moves me one step closer to target apple (3, 6). Next turn I can move UP to (4, 7) or LEFT to (3, 6). If I move UP to (4, 7), the next move can be LEFT to (3, 6). If I move LEFT to (3, 6), I eat the apple immediately.\n\n**Comparing LEFT to UP (from (5, 6)):**\nLast turn I chose UP: New position (5, 6). Next move could be LEFT to (4, 6), then LEFT again to (3, 6) to eat the apple. (3 turns total from start to consumption).\n\nIf I choose LEFT now: New position (4, 6). Next move can be LEFT to (3, 6) to eat the apple. (2 turns total from start to consumption).\n\nMoving LEFT now leads to the apple one turn sooner than if I had moved UP last turn and then moved LEFT now. Since LEFT is safe, it is the superior move for efficiency towards the closest apple.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move towards (3, 6) by moving LEFT in this turn to reach (4, 6). If safe next turn, move LEFT again to eat (3, 6). If the enemy moves aggressively toward me, prioritize safety, but for now, the path towards the apple is clear and direct.\n\nLEFT",

The tail is effectively at (1, 3) if it hasn't eaten this turn, but since it ate last turn (Score 1), its length is 2 (H, B1).

UP to (2, 5). This targets apple (2, 5) AND blocks my path if I choose to aim there (or potentially collides with me if I aim there).\n2. DOWN to (2, 3). Hits its own body segment! (2, 3) is the body segment B1. **Snake #0 cannot move DOWN.**\n3. LEFT to (1, 4). Safe.\n4. RIGHT to (3, 4). Safe.\nValid enemy moves: (2, 5), (1, 4), (3, 4).\n\n**Evaluate My Moves (Head at (3, 6), Body [(4, 6)]):**\nMy body is small, making movement relatively unconstrained unless I try to move back onto (4, 6).\n\n1. **Move UP to (3, 7):** Safe from boundaries/self. Enemy futures: None land on (3, 7).\n   Pros: Moves generally towards the cluster of apples (2, 7) and (2, 5).\n   Cons: Does not eat an apple this turn. Requires 1 move to reach (2, 7) or (2, 5) if the enemy cooperates.\n\n2. **Move DOWN to (3, 5):** Safe from boundaries/self. Enemy futures: None land on (3, 5).\n   Pros: Moves towards (2, 5).\n   Cons: Enemy might move to (2, 5) via UP, potentially claiming the apple or blocking me.\n\n3. **Move LEFT to (2, 6):** Safe from boundaries/self. Enemy futures: None land on (2, 6).\n   Pros: Moves closer to (2, 7) / (2, 5).\n   Cons: Does not eat an apple this turn.\n\n4. **Move RIGHT to (4, 6):** This is my own body segment (4, 6). **CRASH INTO OWN BODY. Invalid move.**\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves:**\n\n*   **UP to (3, 7):** Next turn I could move LEFT to (2, 7) to eat an apple.\n    *   If I move (3, 7), Enemy moves to (2, 5) [Eats Apple] or (1, 4) or (3, 4).\n    *   If Enemy moves to (2, 5) [Eats Apple], My head will be at (3, 7). My next move (LEFT to (2, 7)) eats an apple, but Enemy gets the first one.\n    *   If Enemy moves to (1, 4) or (3, 4), I move LEFT to (2, 7) and eat an apple.\n\n*   **LEFT to (2, 6):** Next turn I could move UP to (2, 7) OR DOWN to (2, 5) to eat an apple.\n    *   If I move (2, 6), Enemy moves to (2, 5) [Eats Apple] or (1, 4) or (3, 4).\n    *   If Enemy moves to (2, 5) [Eats Apple], I move UP to (2, 7) and eat an apple. (Both eat).\n    *   If Enemy moves to (1, 4) or (3, 4), I can choose to eat (2, 7) or (2, 5).\n\n*   **DOWN to (3, 5):** Next turn I could move LEFT to (2, 5) to eat an apple.\n    *   If I move (3, 5), Enemy moves to (2, 5) [Eats Apple] or (1, 4) or (3, 4).\n    *   If Enemy moves to (2, 5) [Eats Apple], I must aim for (2, 7) next turn, which requires 2 moves (e.g., U, L).\n\nThe primary threat is the enemy eating one of the two equally close apples ((2, 5) or (2, 7)). Since the enemy can move directly to (2, 5) (move UP), if I move to (3, 7) or (3, 5), the enemy likely grabs (2, 5), leaving (2, 7) for me, requiring 2 moves total (or one move to get closer).\n\nIf I move **LEFT to (2, 6)**:\n1.  I am adjacent to both (2, 5) and (2, 7).\n2.  Enemy moves: E1=(2, 5) [Eats], E2=(1, 4), E3=(3, 4).\n    *   Case E1: Enemy eats (2, 5). I move UP to (2, 7) and eat the other apple. Result: Draw on apples this turn, position parity maintained near the cluster.\n    *   Case E2: Enemy moves to (1, 4). I move UP to (2, 7) and eat an apple. Result: I win the apple race this turn.\n    *   Case E3: Enemy moves to (3, 4). I move UP to (2, 7) and eat an apple. Result: I win the apple race this turn.\n\nMoving LEFT to (2, 6) seems the most strategically sound choice. It puts me in a position to directly challenge *both* close apples next turn, maximizing my chance to eat at least one, even if the enemy prioritizes eating (2, 5). It avoids any immediate collision risks this turn.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\n1. Move LEFT now to (2, 6).\n2. On Turn 4, assess enemy position. If enemy ate (2, 5) by moving to (2, 5), I move UP to (2, 7) to eat the remaining apple. If the enemy moved elsewhere, I choose the best target ((2, 7) or (2, 5)) to eat.\n3. After clearing the (2, 5)/(2, 7) cluster, target (6, 8).\n\n**Safety Check for Move LEFT to (2, 6):**\n1. Boundaries: Safe.\n2. Self-collision: Body is [(4, 6)]. (2, 6) is safe.\n3. Enemy collision: Enemy moves are (2, 5), (1, 4), (3, 4). None land on (2, 6). Safe.\n4. Head-on collision: Enemy head (2, 4) moves to one of the three spots above. No danger of landing on (2, 6). Safe.\n\nThe move LEFT is optimal for this turn.\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

This means the previous body segment (2, 3) is now the tail, and the previous head (2, 4) is the first segment. **Snake #0 did NOT grow in length, meaning it did NOT eat an apple.**\n\nLet's re-examine the inputs based on the state provided for Turn 4:\nTurn 3 State: Apple (2, 5) was present. Snake #0 Head (2, 4), Body [(2, 3)]. My Head (3, 6), Body [(4, 6)].\nMy Move: LEFT -> Head (2, 6).

(Must have eaten A at (2, 5) in Turn 3).\nSnake #0 Head: (2, 5), Body: [(2, 4), (2, 3)]. Length 3. (This confirms E ate an apple at (2, 5) in T3, resulting in Length 3 body segments, and ending T3 with Head (2, 5)).\n\nMy Move Last Turn: LEFT. Head moved (3, 6) -> (2, 6). My Score 1, Length 2: Head (2, 6), Body [(3, 6)].\nThis means my move in T3 did NOT eat an apple (the apple at (3, 6) was consumed by me in T2).\n\n**Revisiting T3 State (implied from T4 state):**\nBefore T3 move: My Head (3, 6), Body [(4, 6)]. Apples (2, 5) present. E Head (2, 4), Body [(2, 3)]. E Score 1.\nMy Move: LEFT -> (2, 6). (Did not eat). New My Head (2, 6), Body [(3, 6)]. My Score 1.\nE Move: UP -> (2, 5). Apple (2, 5) eaten. New E Head (2, 5), Body [(2, 4), (2, 3)]. E Score 2.\n\nThis interpretation matches the provided state for Turn 4 perfectly. I missed eating an apple last turn, and the enemy successfully ate (2, 5).\n\n**CURRENT STATE (Turn 4 Start):**\nMy Head: (2, 6). Body: [(3, 6)]. Length 2. Score 1.\nEnemy Head: (2, 5). Body: [(2, 4), (2, 3)]. Length 3.

New Head (2, 7), Body [(2, 6), (3, 6)]. Score 2.\n2. DOWN to (2, 5): Collision with Enemy Head (2, 5)! **I die if I move DOWN.**\n3. LEFT to (1, 6): Safe.\n4. RIGHT to (3, 6): Self collision (Body segment 1). **I cannot move RIGHT.**\nValid moves: UP, LEFT.\n\n**Move Evaluation:**\n\n1. **If I move DOWN (2, 5): I die (Head-on collision with E head).** ELIMINATED.\n2. **If I move RIGHT (3, 6): I die (Self-collision).** ELIMINATED.\n\nRemaining safe moves: UP (to (2, 7)) and LEFT (to (1, 6)).\n\n**Move UP to (2, 7) [EAT APPLE]:**\nIf I move UP: My Head (2, 7). My Body [(2, 6), (3, 6)]. Score 2.\nEnemy Response Check:\n    a) E moves to (2, 6) [Collision]: E dies. I survive and eat the apple. I win the apple count (2 vs 1) and maintain control/survival. **BEST OUTCOME.**\n    b) E moves to (1, 5) [Safe]: E survives. I eat the apple. Score 2 vs 2. Positions diverge.\n    c) E moves to (3, 5) [Safe]: E survives. I eat the apple. Score 2 vs 2. Positions diverge.\n\n**Move LEFT to (1, 6) [Do Not Eat]:**\nIf I move LEFT: My Head (1, 6). My Body [(2, 6), (3, 6)]. Score 1.\nEnemy Response Check:\n    a) E moves to (2, 6) [Collision]: E dies. I survive but do not eat this turn. Score 1 vs 2 (Enemy still has 2 apples collected).\n    b) E moves to (1, 5) [Safe]: E survives. Score 1 vs 2. E leads significantly.\n    c) E moves to (3, 5) [Safe]: E survives. Score 1 vs 2. E leads significantly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving UP to (2, 7) is superior because it secures an apple *and* presents a guaranteed kill opportunity against the enemy snake (Scenario 1a). If the enemy avoids the collision, I still gain an apple and tie the score. If I move LEFT, I miss an apple and let the enemy maintain its score lead unless it commits suicide into my new position, which is less likely than it avoiding death while I gain nothing.\n\nStrategy: Secure the apple at (2, 7) and force the enemy into either death or a retreat, putting me in a favorable position relative to the scoreboard.\n\nLong Term Plan: After this move, I aim to clear the remaining nearby apple at (4, 1) or head toward the far apples (6, 8), while ensuring growth. Killing the opponent is the highest priority if a safe opportunity exists.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nUP",

(E cannot move to (2, 6) without self-collision, as I moved there from (2, 6) in T4.

LEFT to (1, 5): E survives. New Body [(2, 5), (2, 4)]. (Matches provided state structure if T4 E body was [(2, 4), (2, 3)] and E did NOT eat. E moved (2, 5) -> (1, 5). Old head (2, 5) -> body (2, 5).

RIGHT to (2, 5): Hits E Body Segment 1 (2, 5). **E dies if E moves RIGHT.**\n\n**Strategy for Turn 5:**\nI have a guaranteed way to eliminate the opponent this turn (if they make a local mistake). I should prioritize a move that traps or forces the opponent into a bad decision, ideally leading to a kill while positioning myself well for the next turn.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 7):\nMy Head (3, 7). Body [(2, 7), (2, 6)].\nE must avoid RIGHT (2, 5). E can choose UP (1, 6), DOWN (1, 4), LEFT (0, 5). All are safe for E. Nothing guaranteed.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 7):\nMy Head (1, 7).

Body [(2, 7), (2, 6)].\nE must avoid RIGHT (2, 5). E can choose UP (1, 6), DOWN (1, 4), LEFT (0, 5). Nothing guaranteed.\n\nSince there is no immediate forced kill opportunity against the opponent this turn based on their possible reactions, the best move is the one that progresses toward the nearest available apples while keeping the structure safe.\n\nNearest Apples:\nA(2, 0) - Far south.\nA(4, 1) - Relatively close, southwest.\nA(6, 8), A(6, 9) - Northeast.\nA(9, 4) - East.\n\nMy current location (2, 7) is somewhat central on the top edge. Moving towards A(6, 8) or A(4, 1) seems reasonable.\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 8): I am moving toward A(6, 8) and A(6, 9). This maintains a central vertical line.\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 7): I am moving diagonally towards A(4, 1) and A(6, 8).\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 7): I am moving away from easy access to other apples, toward the left edge.\n\nMoving UP to (2, 8) seems the most linear progression toward the cluster of apples in the top right quadrant ((6, 8), (6, 9)). Since I grew last turn, I can afford to move slightly away from direct apple pursuit to maintain central positioning, especially since the enemy is currently positioned somewhat low and left (1, 5).\n\nLong Term Plan: Continue moving toward the (6, 8) and (6, 9) apples while maintaining a safe body configuration. Try to force the enemy into a position where they must hit my body or move into a corner.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nUP",

Less ideal for reaching (6, 8) or (4, 1) efficiently.\n\nComparing A and B: Moving RIGHT (B) positions me slightly better locally towards the center and closer to A(4, 1) than standing right on the edge (A). Being at (3, 8) is a good central launching point for either moving East toward the 6XX apples or angling South-East towards 4, 1.\n\n**Collision Checks for Move RIGHT (3, 8):**\nMy new body: [(2, 8), (2, 7)]. E's body: [(2, 5), (2, 4)].\n1. E UP (1, 6): My head (3, 8). Safe.\n2. E DOWN (1, 4): My head (3, 8). Safe. (E moves onto its own old head position (1, 5) if it had moved RIGHT last turn, but it didn't). (1, 4) is safe as my body isn't there.\n3. E LEFT (0, 5): My head (3, 8). Safe.\n\nNo immediate forced kills or collisions are apparent if I move RIGHT. This move advances the snake towards the general area of apples while maintaining excellent mobility.\n\nLong Term Plan: Continue advancing towards the top-right apple cluster (6, 8, 6, 9) or the western apple (4, 1). Maintain a central position to maximize options and avoid trapping due to the narrow 10x10 board. Watch for opportunities to push Snake #0 towards the edges or into a collision.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

E moves RIGHT to (2, 3): Safe (distance 2).\n\nComparing safety and progress:\nMoving UP (A) seems best. It advances me towards the highest concentration of remaining apples (6, 8 and 6, 9) while being far away from E's path, regardless of E's choice to survive (E is currently at (1, 3)). Moving RIGHT (C) is also good for apple progress, but UP keeps me slightly higher and potentially maximizes future paths Eastwards towards column 6.\n\nLet's confirm collisions for **UP to (3, 9)**. New body: [(3, 8), (2, 8)].\nIf E survives by going DOWN to (1, 2), there is no collision.\nIf E survives by going LEFT to (0, 3), there is no collision.\nIf E survives by going RIGHT to (2, 3), there is no collision.\n\nUP is the most direct path towards securing the top apples (6, 8) and (6, 9) while maintaining safety against any likely move from Snake #0.\n\nLong Term Plan: Continue advancing towards the top-right apples (6, 8) and (6, 9). Maintain positional advantage by staying high on the board. Monitor the status of Snake #0 to ensure they do not accidentally cut off movement between my current position and any remaining apples. Given E's high chance of self-destruction (moving UP to (1, 4)), this turn might see E die, simplifying matters greatly. If E survives, I should prioritize the top apples.\n\nUP",

No, the score is 2, which is what it was on Turn 7 start. This means the snake did **not** eat an apple on Turn 7, but *grew* because the move was illegal or the structure implies growth even without eating?\n\nLet's re-examine the state structure vs. the rationale provided:\nRationale for Turn 7 stated my head was (3, 8) and body was [(2, 8), (2, 7)]. Last move pick was UP.\nIf last move was UP from (3, 8), the new head is (3, 9).\nIf the snake *didn't* eat, the new body should be [(3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7)]. Length would be 4.\n\nThe provided Turn 8 state is:\nHead: (3, 9)\nBody: [(3, 8), (2, 8)] (Length 3)\nApples collected: 2\n\nThis state implies significant pruning occurred, or the game state presented is inconsistent with standard movement/growth if the snake successfully moved UP in Turn 7 without eating.\n**Assumption based on provided state:** Since the length is 3 and score is 2, and the head is (3, 9), the snake moved to (3, 9) last turn. Since it didn't grow, it didn't eat. The tail must have moved accordingly (the tail segment (2, 7) is gone, and (3, 8) is the new tail segment).

E will choose UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n**Analyzing consequences of my safe moves (LEFT, RIGHT) assuming E survives (UP, DOWN, RIGHT):**\n\nGoal: Advance towards apples, especially the dense group at (6, 8) and (6, 9) or the isolated one at (9, 4). (4, 1) and (2, 0) are further away.\n\n**A. If I move LEFT to (2, 9):** I move towards the center top, maintaining distance from E (who is currently at column 2/3).\n1. E moves UP to (2, 4): Immediate threat distance remains high.\n2. E moves DOWN to (2, 2): Immediate threat distance remains high.\n3. E moves RIGHT to (3, 3): Immediate threat distance remains high.\n\n**B. If I move RIGHT to (4, 9):** I move towards the right edge, one step closer to (6, 8)/(6, 9).\n1. E moves UP/DOWN/RIGHT: Threat distance remains high.\n\nComparing LEFT vs RIGHT:\nMoving RIGHT ((4, 9)) seems slightly better as it directly feeds into the path towards the highest value apples (6, 8) and (6, 9). Since there are no immediate collision threats, maximizing progress towards the nearest high-density apple cluster is the best strategy.\n\nCheck for collisions if I move RIGHT to (4, 9) and E moves optimally *not* into me.\nMy New Head: (4, 9). My New Tail Segment: (3, 9). My Body: [(4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)].\nE's possible heads: (2, 4), (2, 2), or (3, 3).\nNone of these land on (4, 9) or my body segments. I am safe.\n\nIf E chooses to move RIGHT to (3, 3) (the most threatening move towards me in terms of closing the X gap), my head is at (4, 9) and E's head is at (3, 3). This is safe.\n\nIf E chooses to move UP to (2, 4) or DOWN to (2, 2), the distance remains large.\n\nConclusion: RIGHT maximizes progress towards the top-right apples (6, 8) and (6, 9) while remaining completely safe against E's possible moves (assuming E survives).\n\nLong Term Plan: Continue moving right and up towards the apples at (6, 8) and (6, 9). Since my current position (3, 9) heavily restricts downward movement (DOWN leads to self-collision), moving RIGHT is essential this turn to gain freedom of movement for the next turn. If I moved LEFT to (2, 9), my next move DOWN to (2, 8) would hit my body segment (2, 8), so I'd be restricted to UP/LEFT afterwards. Moving RIGHT opens up (4, 8) or (5, 9) next.\n\nRIGHT",

New body: [(2, 2), (1, 2)].\n\nThe enemy has no immediate constraints forcing them into me, nor do they have any immediate self-destructs based on their body position. They will likely aim for apples or strategic positioning.\n\n**Analyzing consequences of my safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT):**\n\nGoal: Advance towards the nearest appealing apples: (6, 8) and (6, 9).\n\n**A. If I move DOWN to (4, 8):**\nI am moving away from the top-right apples and towards the center-bottom. This move also blocks potential future movement towards (4, 1) and (2, 0) if I have to zig-zag. My only immediate opening for the next turn would be RIGHT to (5, 8) or BACK to (4, 9) if the enemy's move allows it (but moving back to the head position (4, 9) would be suicide if the opponent moves to (4, 9)).\n\n**B. If I move RIGHT to (5, 9):**\nI am continuing the trajectory towards the high-value apples at column 6. This keeps my head high up on the board, which is generally safer than getting boxed in low down.\n\n**Collision Analysis for RIGHT (to 5, 9):**\nMy New Head: (5, 9). My New Body: [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)].\nE's possible heads: (2, 3), (2, 1), (1, 2), (3, 2).\nNone of these land on (5, 9) or my body segments. This is safe against E's potential moves.\n\n**Collision Analysis for DOWN (to 4, 8):**\nMy New Head: (4, 8). My New Body: [(4, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9)]. (Note: The order of body segments needs to reflect head-to-tail: [(4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9)] if the tail segment (3, 8) was dropped, OR [(4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)] if the tail was dropped and my old head (4, 9) became the first body segment. Let's use the consistent rule: remove tail, add new head).\nMy old body was [(4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)]. Tail is (3, 8).\nNew body if DOWN: [(4, 8), (4, 9), (3, 9)].\nE's possible heads: (2, 3), (2, 1), (1, 2), (3, 2). Safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving RIGHT (to (5, 9)) is strictly better than moving DOWN (to (4, 8)) because it advances my position towards the cluster of high-value apples (6, 8), (6, 9), and the head remains maximally positioned on the edge for future maneuvering.\n\nStrategy Note: Continue moving right along row 9 until reaching column 6 to target the top apples. Then navigate (6, 9) -> (6, 8) and seek growth.\n\nRIGHT",

Note: The rationale above calculated the state *after* the move, but this turn starts *after* that move completed. Let's re-verify the current state based on the provided input.)\n\n**Current State Verification based on Input:**\nApples at: (9, 4), (6, 8), (4, 1), (8, 7), (1, 4)\nYour snake (ID: 1):\n  - Head: (6, 9)\n  - Body: [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)] (*Wait, the body list seems shorter than expected if it ate an apple last turn. The provided body has length 3. If it ate an apple, length should be 4.*)\n  - Apples collected: 3\n\nLet's reconcile the 'Last Move Information' with the 'Current State':\nLast Move Rationale concluded: Move RIGHT to (6, 9) eating an apple.\nIf I moved RIGHT to (6, 9) at Turn 10, my new body should be length 4 (3 body segments + 1 head segment = 4 total length before eating, 5 after eating).\nLast turn head: (5, 9). Body: [(4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)]. Length 4.\nIf I moved RIGHT to (6, 9) and ate, my new state should be: Head (6, 9), Body [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)]. Length 5, Apples 4.\n\nHowever, the *current* state given is: Head (6, 9), Body: [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)]. Length 4, Apples 3.\nThis implies one of two things happened in the last move:\n1. I moved RIGHT to (6, 9) but it was *not* an apple, or the game state provided is after I moved there, but somehow lost the growth/apple point compared to the rationale conclusion, OR,\n2. The provided \"last move information\" represents a hypothetical choice, but the actual move recorded in the current state was different/didn't consume the apple.\n\nLet's trust the explicit Current State provided for Turn 11:\nMy Head: (6, 9). My Body: [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)]. Length 4. Apples 3. (Tail is (3, 9)).\nThis means my last move resulted in a body shift, not growth, compared to the head position indicated in the rationale (5, 9).\nIf Head was (5, 9), Body [(4, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)]. If I moved RIGHT to (6, 9) without eating, my new body would be [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)]. This matches the current body structure if the tail (3, 8) was dropped, meaning the move was *not* an apple grab.\n\nGiven the explicit current state, I will proceed based on:\n**My Snake (ID 1): Head (6, 9).

Analyze Collision with Enemy Snake #0 (Head at (2, 0)):**\n\nEnemy Potential Moves (E moves from (2, 0), Body [(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)]):\nE's last move was likely UP (from (2, 3) to (2, 0) if they also didn't eat). The board shows E at (2, 0).\nE's safe next moves:\n1. UP to (2, 1): Hits E body segment 1. **E dies?** No, (2, 1) is E's current segment 1. If E moves UP, the body shifts: [(2, 0) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2)]. New head (2, 1). Old segment (2, 3) is dropped if no growth. Wait, E body is [(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)].\n   If E moves UP to (2, 1): E head moves to (2, 1). This means it instantly runs into its own body segment at (2, 1). **E dies if this move is chosen.**\n2. DOWN to (2, -1): Off board. **Illegal.**\n3. LEFT to (1, 0): Safe. New Head (1, 0). New Body: [(1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)]. (Tail (2, 3) dropped if no growth).\n4. RIGHT to (3, 0): Safe. New Head (3, 0). New Body: [(3, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1)].\n\n**Crucial Safety Check: E's move UP to (2, 1) is suicide.** This means E will likely choose LEFT (1, 0) or RIGHT (3, 0) or potentially DOWN if the board wraps (it doesn't). E is likely to move to (1, 0) or (3, 0).\n\n**3. Analyze Consequences of My Safe Moves (DOWN (to eat), RIGHT):**\n\n**A. Move DOWN to (6, 8) (Apple):**\nMy Head lands at (6, 8). I collect the apple, grow to length 5.\nMy New State: H: (6, 8). B: [(6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)]. Apples 4.\n\nEnemy New Head options: (1, 0) or (3, 0).\nDoes (6, 8) collide with any of E's future positions? No. (6, 8) is far from the (1-3, 0) zone. **This move is safe.** This move prioritizes score and position improvement over short-term safety considerations (since E is far away).\n\n**B. Move RIGHT to (7, 9):**\nMy Head lands at (7, 9). No growth.\nMy New State: H: (7, 9). B: [(6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9)]. Apples 3.\n\nEnemy New Head options: (1, 0) or (3, 0). Safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving DOWN to (6, 8) is the optimal move. It safely eats a high apple, increases length, and sets up the next move (perhaps UP to (6, 9) again if the enemy doesn't block, or repositioning). Since the move is safe regarding enemy position, maximizing immediate reward is best.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue grabbing the remaining high apples ((9, 4), (8, 7)) if possible, while ensuring the snake doesn't get trapped by the enemy's slow traversal below. (6, 8) is secured. Next target is (9, 4) or (8, 7).\n\nDOWN",

(Board shows (2, 2) is the third segment, so tail is segment 4 if length is 4, but the listed body has length 3: [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)] means tail is (2, 2) if growth didn't happen, or the board picture reflects the state BEFORE the last move).\n\nLet's strictly use the board mapping provided above for the *current* state, as it is authoritative for Turn 12:\nBoard state:\n9 . . . T T T T . . . (Snake #0 elements marked 'T')\n8 . . . . . . 1 . . . (Snake 1 element marked '1')\n...\nMy Head: (6, 9). Body: [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)] -> This is length 4.

(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9) are body segments indicated by 'T' at (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9).

My Head is (6, 9).\nThe board shows T at columns 3, 4, 5, 6 in row 9. This implies my body is (6, 9) [Head], (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9). This means my tail is at (3, 9).\nIf the provided list `Body: [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)]` is ordered T->H, and the Head is (6, 9), the sequence is (6, 9) -> (5, 9) -> (4, 9) -> (3, 9).

This means E is length 4, Head (3, 0), Body [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]. Ah, the board key mapping is Snake 1=1, Snake 0=0, and all other segments (Friendly/Enemy) are T.\n\nReconciling Board Visual with Provided Lists for Turn 12:\n1. My Snake (1): Head (6, 9). Body [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)]. Length 4. List matches visual T's at R9, C3-C5 relative to H at C6. (T-T-T head).

This means segments at (6,9), (5,9), (4,9), (3,9) are all friendly. Okay, the board drawing seems to use T for all snake segments *except* the heads (0 and 1).\n   My segments: (6, 9) H, (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9) B.\n\n2. Enemy Snake #0: Head (3, 0) marked '0'.

If that happened, my apples are 4, and my length is 5.\n**Current Input State:** Apples: 4, Snake 0 Apples: 3. (My score is confirmed 4).\n\n**If Apples = 4, then Length must be 5.**\nIf Length = 5, My Body must have 4 segments.\nMy Body given: [(5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)]. (3 segments). **This input is inconsistent.** I will adjust my known body based on the calculated outcome of the last move (DOWN to (6, 8) eating an apple), as this aligns with the score difference (4 vs 3) and the rationale provided.\n\n**Assumed State for Turn 12 based on Rationale/Score:**\nMy Head: (6, 8).

Length 5. Apples 4.\nEnemy #0 Head: (3, 0). Body: [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]. Assuming length 3 (Apples 3 - 1 = 2 segments survived, or 3 segments total). Let's stick to the listed body for E0: [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]. Length 3.\n\nWait, the board drawing for Turn 12 shows the Snake 1 head at (6, 8) missing, and the board is shown BEFORE my move on Turn 12 begins.\nThe game provides:\nTurn: 12 / 150\nApples at: (9, 4), (4, 1), (8, 7), (1, 4), (1, 6)\nScore: Mine 4, E0: 3\nMy Snake (ID: 1): Head: (6, 8). Body: [(6, 9), (5, 9), (4, 9), (3, 9)]. (Length 5).\n\n**THIS IS THE CORRECT STARTING STATE FOR TURN 12.** The previous rationale describing Turn 11's move (\"DOWN\") must have been correct, leading to this state. The only apple that could have been eaten is (6, 8) if it was at (6, 8) before Turn 11 began, or the configuration shown in the board visual for T11 was wrong. Let's trust the state provided for T12.\n\n**Enemy Snake #0:** Head: (3, 0), Body: [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]. Length 4 (assuming 3 apples means 4 segments).

New Body: [(7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9)]. (Tail (3, 9) drops).\n\n**2. Enemy Safety Check (E0 Head at (3, 0), Body [(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]):**\nE's viable moves (avoiding self-collision into (2, 0) or (2, 1)):\n*   UP to (3, 1): Safe. New Body: [(3, 1), (3, 0), (2, 0)]. (Tail (2, 2) drops).\n*   LEFT to (2, 0): Collides with E body segment 1. **E dies.**\n*   RIGHT to (4, 0): Safe. New Body: [(4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0)]. (Tail (2, 2) drops).\n\nE is likely to move UP to (3, 1) or RIGHT to (4, 0). Both keep E away from me.\n\n**3. Move Selection:**\nThe primary goal is reaching the apple at (8, 7).\n\n*   **DOWN to (6, 7):** Moves slightly further from (8, 7) in terms of X coordinate.\n*   **RIGHT to (7, 8):** Moves 1 step closer to (8, 7) (Distance 1).\n*   **LEFT to (5, 8):** Moves away from (8, 7) (Distance 3).\n\nMoving **RIGHT to (7, 8)** positions us perfectly to grab the apple at (8, 7) next turn by moving RIGHT again, assuming E doesn't interfere with (8, 8) or (7, 7) in a dangerous way (which is unlikely given E's low position).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (7, 8):\nNext turn, I move RIGHT again to (8, 7) and eat. This is a 2-turn approach to an apple.\n\nIf E moves UP to (3, 1): E is still far away. No collision risk with (7, 8).\n\nIf I move UP, I die immediately because (6, 9) is my own body.\n\nRIGHT is the best path towards the nearest high-value target.\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Move RIGHT maximizing approach toward (8, 7). If (8, 7) is taken next time, I will reassess the remaining apples relative to my new position. Since I am ahead in score, maintaining an aggressive apple collection strategy while ensuring safety is paramount.\n\nRIGHT",

Move UP to (4, 1) to collect the apple and grow.\n2. Move towards (1, 4) or (9, 4) depending on how Snake #1 moves.\n3. Maintain awareness of the board edges and body length (currently short, but growing).\n\nUP",

Let's re-verify distance calculation based on grid movement.\n    *   (6, 8) to (8, 7): 2 steps right, 1 step down = 3 steps total (Manhattan distance).\n    *   If RIGHT to (7, 8): (7, 8) to (8, 7) is 1 step right, 1 step down = 2 steps total. (Improved).\n    *   If DOWN to (6, 7): (6, 7) to (8, 7) is 2 steps right, 0 steps vertical = 2 steps total.

Collision Check (My Move vs E0 Move):**\nTarget (8, 7). E0 is at low Y coordinates. No risk of immediate contact.\n\n**4. Choosing between RIGHT (7, 8) and DOWN (6, 7):**\nMoving RIGHT to (7, 8) positions me adjacently right of my current location, maintaining row alignment with the apple, simplifying the approach to (8, 7) to a single step RIGHT next turn OR a diagonal approach.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 8): Next turn I can go RIGHT to (8, 8) or DOWN to (7, 7). Neither eats (8, 7).\nWait, if I am at (7, 8) and I want to eat (8, 7), I need to move diagonally (which is not allowed) OR use two moves like R then D, or D then R, or R then U/D depending on E0's movement.\n\nLet's re-examine the path from (6, 8) to (8, 7) (Target A):\nPath 1: R -> R -> D (3 turns) OR R -> D -> R (3 turns)\nPath 2: D -> R -> R (3 turns) OR D -> D -> R (3 turns)\n\nCurrent H is (6, 8). Target A is (8, 7).\nOption 1: **RIGHT to (7, 8)**. (My new H is (7, 8)).\nNext move, I must choose a move that positions me for the eat on Turn 14.\nFrom (7, 8) to (8, 7): I need +1 X, -1 Y.\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 7) [Turn 13], then RIGHT to (8, 7) [Turn 14]. This works in 2 turns (Turn 13 move is DOWN).\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 8) [Turn 13], then DOWN to (8, 7) [Turn 14]. This works in 2 turns (Turn 13 move is RIGHT).\n\nSince RIGHT leads directly to the X coordinate of the apple, and DOWN leads directly to the Y coordinate alignment (if we interpret the grid path), RIGHT feels slightly more aggressive towards the target X=8.\n\nIf I choose RIGHT (Move 1): H=(7, 8).\nIf I choose DOWN (Move 1): H=(6, 7).\n\nIf I choose RIGHT: For Turn 14, I should choose DOWN to position for the grab at (8, 7) on Turn 15, or RIGHT to (8, 8) and then rely on E0 not eating it before I can swoop.\n\nLet's stick to the most direct advancement towards the closest apple coordinate pair. RIGHT moves us closer to 8 in X.\n\nLong-Term Plan: Approach (8, 7) via a 2-step sequence maximizing immediate progress.\nTurn 12: Move RIGHT to (7, 8).\nTurn 13: Move DOWN to (7, 7). (Positions for immediate eating of (8, 7) on Turn 14 by moving RIGHT).\nTurn 14: Move RIGHT, eating (8, 7).\n\nThis plan ensures we grab the closest apple in 3 total moves including the current one, while staying safe.\n\nRIGHT",

T T T .`\nIt seems the game map uses '1' for my head, 'T' for my body, and '0' for enemy head.\nMy current body parts seem to be (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9) based on the visual map interpretation if (8, 7) is H. The map indicates:\n(8, 8) is T\n(7, 8) is T\n(6, 8) is T\n(6, 9) is T\n(5, 9) is T\nTotal 6 segments, Length 6. (H + 5 body segments).\n\nEnemy #0 Head (E0H): (4, 2). Body (E0B): [(4, 1), (4, 0), (3, 0), (2, 0)]. Tail (E0T): (2, 0). Length 5.\n\n**2. Evaluate My Moves from (8, 7):**\nTarget is (7, 5).\n*   **LEFT to (7, 7):** Safe from body collision ((8, 8) is next segment). Safe from E0. Move towards the apple cluster (7, 5). **SAFE.**\n*   **DOWN to (8, 6):** Safe from body collision. Moves away from (7, 5) but towards the empty space near the other apples. **SAFE.**\n*   **RIGHT to (9, 7):** Safe from body collision. Edge of board might start limiting growth eventually, but safe for now. **SAFE.**\n*   **UP to (8, 8):** This is the segment directly behind the head (the segment that *just* joined the body). Moving *backwards* into the cell you just left is generally safe unless the segment has moved. In a synchronous move system, moving back into the space your previous head occupied is safe unless that space becomes filled by the opponent or if the old head position is now occupied by a new tail segment that has moved *past* that spot. Since the previous step was (8, 8) -> (8, 7), moving UP to (8, 8) means moving into the cell that now houses the next segment of my body. **COLLISION Risk.** My body segments are: (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8), ... Moving to (8, 8) means hitting my own body segment (8, 8). **FATAL.**\n\n**3. Collision Check (My Move vs E0 Move):**\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 7): E0 is at (4, 2). E0 will likely move towards the center or try to secure territory. If E0 moves to (4, 3) (UP) or (3, 2) (LEFT) or (5, 2) (RIGHT) or (4, 1) (DOWN/retreat). No immediate collision risk.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\nLEFT to (7, 7) is the only move that progresses towards the closest remaining apple (7, 5) while remaining safe. UP is fatal as it hits my newly formed body segment at (8, 8).\n\n**LTP Update:** Focus on reaching (7, 5) in the next 1-2 moves. Then assess the distance to the apples at Y=4/Y=6.\n\nLEFT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nLEFT",

Evaluation:**\nMoving DOWN to (7, 6) puts me immediately adjacent to the apple at (7, 5). This is the greedy, high-reward move.\nMoving LEFT to (6, 7) is safer if the path to (7, 5) becomes suddenly blocked, but wastes a step.\n\n**4. Enemy Check (E0 at (4, 2)):**\nE0 needs many turns to reach the vicinity of (7, 5). I am safe from collision with E0 this turn regardless of my move.\n\n**Strategy:** Go directly for the closest apple (7, 5) by moving DOWN to (7, 6).\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Collect (7, 5) next turn. Then, target (9, 4) or (9, 6). (1, 4) and (1, 6) are far.\n\nDOWN",

I must proceed based on the state provided **for Turn 18**.\n\n**Entering Turn 18:**\nH: (7, 5) (Implies the move DOWN on Turn 17 successfully ate the apple at (7, 5) if score 6 is correct relative to the previous state of 5 apples).\nBody: [(7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8)] (Length 7 since score is 6)\nTail: (6, 8). *Wait, if the score is 6 and the body length is 6 segments listed, the snake length is 7. The last segment should be what was there before the growth. If the previous body was length 5, and we ate an apple, the new body length should be 6 (H + 6 segments). The provided body list has 6 segments, making the total length 7.*\nLet's assume Length = 7, Body = [(7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8)] (Head at (7, 5)). The tail is (6, 8). This is consistent with a length 7 snake that just extended.\n\n**Apples Available:** (9, 4), (1, 4), (1, 6), (9, 6), (5, 9).\n\n**Enemy E0:** H: (2, 3), B: [(3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1)].\n\n**Self-Collision Check (Backwards Move):**\nPrevious head position was (7, 6). Moving to (7, 5) means the backwards move would be UP to (7, 6). This is safe as (7, 6) is the first segment of the body, but since (7, 6) is occupied by the next segment, we can only move UP if (7, 6) is *not* the cell we are moving into, which is true. Moving directly backwards (UP to (7, 6)) is collision if (7, 6) is the head's immediate neighbor in the direction of travel. Moving UP is safe from self-collision if the head is at (7, 5) and the body segment list is ordered H->T correctly: (7, 6) is owned by the body, so moving UP into it is fatal.\n\n**Safety Check for Move UP to (7, 6):**\nHead (7, 5) moves to (7, 6). Body segment at (7, 6) exists. **FATAL SELF-COLLISION.**\n\n**Possible Moves from (7, 5):**\n1. **UP to (7, 6):** Collision with Body [(7, 6)]. **FATAL.**\n2. **DOWN to (7, 4):** Safe. Approaches apple (9, 4) or (1, 4).\n3. **LEFT to (6, 5):** Safe. Moves towards center.\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 5):** Safe. Moves towards apple (9, 4), (9, 6).\n\n**Enemy Collision Check (E0 at (2, 3)):**\nWe need to predict E0's move. E0 is near the left side. E0's tail is (4, 1).\nE0 needs to find a new target. The closest apples are (1, 4) and (1, 6). E0 will likely move towards the left/top apples.\n\n*Prediction for E0 (Likely going UP or RIGHT):*\nIf E0 moves UP to (2, 4): Safe.\nIf E0 moves RIGHT to (3, 3): Collision with Body [(3, 3)]! Wait, E0's body is [(3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1)]. Moving RIGHT into (3, 3) means E0 runs into its own body at (3, 3). **E0 cannot move RIGHT.** This implies E0 must move UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\nIf E0 moves DOWN to (2, 2): Safe.\nIf E0 moves LEFT to (1, 3): Safe.\n\nSince E0 is unlikely to move near us (around X=7/8) this turn, we focus on our best local move.\n\n**Strategy:** We just ate an apple. We want to move towards the next closest group of apples, which are the two at (9, 4) and (9, 6).\n\nMove RIGHT to (8, 5) seems excellent. It sets us up to reach (9, 4) or (9, 6) next turn, and offers good space.\n\n*   If we move **RIGHT to (8, 5)**:\n    *   Next turn option 1: Reach (9, 5) then (9, 4) or (9, 6).\n    *   Body segments to avoid next turn: If we move RIGHT, the new body segments will be [(8, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8), (6, 8)]. The new tail is (6, 8).\n    *   If we move RIGHT, the move UP to (8, 6) or DOWN to (8, 4) are viable next turn.\n\n*   If we move **DOWN to (7, 4)**:\n    *   We are now closer to (9, 4). Next move could be RIGHT to (8, 4), then RIGHT to (9, 4). This is a direct path.\n\nComparing RIGHT (8, 5) vs DOWN (7, 4):\nDOWN (7, 4) maintains the current X coordinate, keeping us aligned vertically if we need to move towards (9, 4) or (9, 6). It seems slightly more focused on reaching the East side apples immediately.\n\nLet's choose DOWN to maximize proximity to the cluster of apples on the East edge (9, 4), (9, 6).\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Continue moving East/Southeast towards the apples at (9, 4) and (9, 6). After taking one of those, reassess if the Western apples (1, 4), (1, 6) are worth the long trip, or if we should aim for the distant (5, 9). Given the current location, the East side is much better prioritized. Maintain maximum safety margin from E0 (currently far away).\n\nDOWN",

This implies the apple at (9, 4) in the *previous* turn's list must have moved to an occupied spot or disappeared, or my derived state transition from Turn 18's logic was flawed relative to the provided state snapshot for Turn 19.\n\nThe state provided for Turn 19 shows: Head (7, 4), Body ends at (7, 8). Score 6.\nThe state provided for Turn 18 showed: Head (7, 5), Body ended at (6, 8). Score 6.\nIf I moved DOWN from (7, 5) to (7, 4) and ate an apple, my new tail should be (7, 5), and my body list should be one segment longer than the previous turn's body list *minus* the original tail.\nPrevious length 7 (6 segments listed). New length should be 8 (7 segments listed).\nCurrent list: [(7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8)]. This list only has 6 segments. Total length = 7.\n\nIf the score is 6, the length should be 7 (Head + 6 segments).\nIf the previous state (Turn 18) had length 7 (Head at (7, 5) + 6 segments ending at (6, 8)), and I moved DOWN to (7, 4) eating an apple, the new length should be 8 (7 segments listed). The provided list has 6 segments.\n\n*Assumption Correction:* I must assume the provided state snapshot for Turn 19 is the absolute truth immediately before my move selection. My length is 7 (H + 6 segments). The tail is (7, 8). This means I must have *not* eaten an apple on Turn 18 if my length reduced, or the body list is incomplete/misleading regarding the tail extension.\nLet's trust the coordinates: H=(7, 4). Body: [(7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 8), (7, 8)]. The tail is (7, 8). This implies the previous tail (6, 8) was dropped, meaning I did **not** eat an apple last turn. This contradicts the expectation based on the previous rationale block context, but I operate on the current reality.\n\n**Available Moves from (7, 4):**\n\n1.  **Collision Check (Self):**\n    *   UP to (7, 5): Collision with Body segment (7, 5). **FATAL.**\n    *   DOWN to (7, 3): Safe.\n    *   LEFT to (6, 4): Safe.\n    *   RIGHT to (8, 4): Safe.\n\n2.  **Collision Check (Enemy E0 at (1, 3)):**\n    E0's potential moves: UP (1, 4 - Apple!), DOWN (1, 2), LEFT (0, 3).\n    If E0 moves UP to (1, 4), it eats an apple. This is far away from us. No immediate collision risk.\n\n**Target Evaluation:**\nApples: (9, 4) [ADJACENT if we move RIGHT then RIGHT again], (1, 4) [ADJACENT to E0], (1, 6), (9, 6), (5, 9).\n\nWe are currently at (7, 4). The path to (9, 4) is very short: R -> R. This seems optimal.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (8, 4):** Safe. Sets up for (9, 4) next turn.\n*   **Move DOWN to (7, 3):** Moves away from the cluster of East apples (9, 4), (9, 6). Less desirable than RIGHT.\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 4):** Moves away from East apples, towards center. Less desirable than RIGHT.\n\n**Move: RIGHT to (8, 4)**\nThis move places us adjacent to the apple at (9, 4). If E0 doesn't interfere, we eat it next turn by moving RIGHT to (9, 4).\n\n**Long Term Plan:** Move towards the cluster of apples on the right edge (9, 4), (9, 6). Try to secure (9, 4) next turn.\n\n**Predicted Enemy Move (E0):** E0 is near (1, 4) and (1, 6). It will almost certainly move UP to (1, 4) to eat the apple.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 4):\nTurn 20: My H=(8, 4).

They pose no immediate threat to my position at (1, 4).\n\n**Strategic Selection:**\n*   **UP (1, 4)** is the optimal move. It collects an apple, increasing my score to 5 and length to 6. From (1, 4), the next logical step is to continue moving UP toward the apple at (1, 6).\n*   The board on the left (x=0 to x=3) is very open, allowing for safe maneuvering.\n\n**Plan for future turns:**\n1. Move UP to (1, 4) to collect the apple (Score 5).\n2. Move UP to (1, 5) then UP to (1, 6) to collect the next apple (Score 6).\n3. After (1, 6), reassess the board. The apple at (5, 9) or the cluster on the right will be the next targets.\n\nUP",

E0 moved UP from (1, 3) to (1, 4) and collected an apple, increasing its score to 5 (Wait, E0 score was listed as 5 before the move, and it had an apple at (1, 6) and (1, 4) in the previous lists. Let's recheck the initial state provided for Turn 20).\n\n**Turn 20 Initial State Check:**\nApples: (9, 4), (1, 6), (9, 6), (5, 9), (6, 5). (Note: (1, 4) is missing, implying E0 ate it last turn).\nMy Head: (8, 4).\nE0 Head: (1, 4).\nIf E0's head is at (1, 4) in the T20 snapshot, it means E0 must have moved there and eaten the apple that was at (1, 4) during T19 calculation, *if* the board state provided reflects the result of the T19 move.\n\nThe provided board state for Turn 20 (after my last move and before my next move evaluation) shows:\nE0 (0) at (1, 4).\nMy Snake (1) at (8, 4).\nIf E0 ate the apple at (1, 4) last turn, its score should be 6, but it is listed as 5. This suggests E0 *moved* to (1, 4) but did *not* eat an apple, or the apple list is inconsistent with the board display if we assume E0 ate it.\n\nHowever, the key is my move now, from (8, 4).\n\n**Available Moves from (8, 4):**\n\n1.  **Collision Check (Self):**\n    *   UP to (8, 5): Safe.\n    *   DOWN to (8, 3): Safe.\n    *   LEFT to (7, 4): Collision with Body segment (7, 4). **FATAL.**\n    *   RIGHT to (9, 4): Collision/Apple at (9, 4). **APPLE.**\n\n2.  **Collision Check (Enemy E0 at (1, 4)):**\n    E0 is too far to collide this turn.\n\n**Target Evaluation:**\nThe apple at (9, 4) is immediately adjacent. Moving RIGHT will eat this apple, increasing my score to 7 and my length to 8.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (9, 4):** Eats apple. Safe from self collision (my previous body segment at (7, 4) is not adjacent to (8, 4) in reverse direction). Safe from E0.\n\n**Enemy Movement Prediction (E0 at (1, 4)):**\nE0 needs to move toward (1, 6) or (5, 9) or (6, 5). It is safe. Its best bet is likely UP to (1, 5) or LEFT to (0, 4). UP keeps it near the other high-Y apple (1, 6).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 4) and eat the apple:\nTurn 21: My H=(9, 4). E0 H=(1, 5) (assuming UP move).\nI will then be looking at (9, 6) next.\n\nThis move is clearly the highest priority as it secures immediate food and growth at minimal risk.\n\n**Long-Term Plan:** Secure the apple at (9, 4) now. Then aim for (9, 6). After dealing with the right edge cluster, reassess the central/left apples ((6, 5), (5, 9), (1, 6)). Maintain distance from E0 unless an opportunity for a fatal strike arises, which is unlikely given the board separation.\n\nRIGHT",

In a non-eating move, the tail segment disappears, and the head moves into the old head position. Since I ate an apple last turn, my tail did *not* move, so (8, 4) is currently occupied by $B_1$. If I move to (8, 4), I collide with $B_1$.

It might be slightly safer if E0 performs an unexpected move towards me, but the board separation is significant.\n\n**Strategy Selection:**\nThe optimal strategy is to move towards the nearest apple, (9, 6). Moving UP to (9, 5) achieves this immediately. There is no immediate defensive necessity as the board is open and E0 is far away.\n\nLong Term Plan: Secure (9, 6) next turn. Then potentially move to intercept E0's path/apples near the center/left, focusing on (6, 5) or (5, 9).

Not near any immediate threats. Moving towards the bottom half.\n3.  **LEFT to (7, 6):** Collision with my body segment at (7, 6). **FATAL.**\n4.  **RIGHT to (9, 6):** Safe. Moving back one step towards the wall.\n\n**Safe Moves:** UP (8, 7), DOWN (8, 5), RIGHT (9, 6).\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves against Target (6, 5):**\n*   Distance to (6, 5) for each new head position:\n    *   (8, 7): $\\sqrt{(8-6)^2 + (7-5)^2} = \\sqrt{4+4} = \\sqrt{8} \\approx 2.83$.\n    *   (8, 5): $\\sqrt{(8-6)^2 + (5-5)^2} = \\sqrt{4+0} = 2.00$. (Closest)\n    *   (9, 6): $\\sqrt{(9-6)^2 + (6-5)^2} = \\sqrt{9+1} = \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.16$. (Furthest)\n\nMoving **DOWN to (8, 5)** minimizes the distance to the target apple (6, 5) on the next turn (only 2 Manhattan steps away, or $\\sqrt{5}$ remaining distance after that move). This seems like the best path to secure the next apple quickly.\n\n**Enemy Consideration (E0):**\nE0 is far away on the left side (likely around X=1). My move to (8, 5) does not put me near E0, nor does it make me vulnerable to E0's likely path towards (1, 9) or downwards.\n\n**Self-Collision Check (Crucial for Snake Movement):**\nIf I move DOWN to (8, 5):\nNew Head: (8, 5)\nPrevious Head: (8, 6)\nBody segment following head: (9, 6)\n(8, 5) is safe.\n\nIf I move UP to (8, 7):\n(8, 7) is safe (my tail was at (7, 7)), but it moves me slightly away from the target (6, 5) compared to (8, 5).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 6):\n(9, 6) is safe (it was the head last turn). This delays progress towards (6, 5).\n\nThe move **DOWN to (8, 5)** offers the fastest, safest route towards the closest apple (6, 5).\n\nDOWN is the chosen move.\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT to (9, 5): Collision (is position 3). **FATAL.**\n\nWait, only **UP to (8, 6)** is safe.\n\nLet's confirm the deadly moves based on the calculated body state:\nBody: H(8, 5) - (8, 6) - (9, 6) - (9, 5) - (8, 4) - (7, 4) - (7, 5) - (7, 6) [Tail] (Length 8, Wait: Length should be 9 because I didn't eat an apple last turn).\n\nLet's correct the body update logic for the previous move (DOWN from (8, 6) to (8, 5), no apple eaten):\nOld Head: (8, 6)\nOld Body (L=9): [(8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 7)]\nNew Head: (8, 5)\nNew Body (L=9): [(8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6)] (Tail is now (7, 6), (7, 7) fell off).\n\nCollision Check for moves FROM (8, 5):\n1. UP to (8, 6): Safe. It is the segment immediately behind the head. Safe move backward.\n2. DOWN to (8, 4): Collision. (Segment 5) **FATAL.**\n3. LEFT to (7, 5): Collision. (Segment 7) **FATAL.**\n4. RIGHT to (9, 5): Collision. (Segment 3) **FATAL.**\n\nIt appears **UP (8, 6)** is the *only* safe move available this turn. Although moving back towards the previous head position doesn't advance me optimally towards (6, 5) (distance increases to $\\sqrt{5}$), survival is paramount.\n\nIf I move UP to (8, 6), my new body will be: [(8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5)].\nWait, a snake cannot move into its *current* head position from the previous turn if it moves backward.\nThe rule is: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n\nIf my head is at H, and the segment right behind it (the one waiting to become the new tail if I move forward) is P1:\nIf I move UP to P_new.\nDoes P_new = H? (This is moving into the cell the head was just on). The game dynamics state that the head moves, and the body shifts. The definition of the segment \"directly behind your head\" must be the segment that *was* the head in the previous turn.\n\nLast move was DOWN to (8, 5). Previous head was at (8, 6). (8, 6) is the segment immediately behind (8, 5) in the current body list: [(8, 5), **(8, 6)**, ...].\n\nIf I move UP to (8, 6), I am moving into the cell occupied by P1, which is defined as \"moving directly backwards\". **This move should be fatal.**\n\nIf the standard interpretation of \"moving backwards\" (into the position the head just vacated) is true, then **I have no safe moves.**\n\nLet's re-examine the common Snake game rule regarding moving into the immediate previous head location (vacated square):\nIn most implementations, moving into the square the head *just left* (the square that becomes the new segment P1) is allowed, UNLESS that square is occupied by an earlier segment due to a *lack* of movement/growth in the previous turn, or *if the game logic strictly forbids moving into the cell behind the head regardless of whether it's empty or not*.\n\nIf the rule means: \"If you move from $H_{old}$ to $H_{new}$, and $H_{new} = P1$ (where $P1$ is the head's previous location), you die,\" then UP (8, 6) is fatal. Given the specific warning about moving backwards being fatal, I must assume this interpretation.\n\nIf UP is fatal: All four moves (based on the analysis above) lead to immediate collisions with existing body segments or are explicitly defined as fatal backward moves.\n\nBody segments at (8, 5):\nH(8, 5)\nP1 (8, 6) - UP destination\nP2 (9, 6) - RIGHT destination\nP3 (9, 5) - RIGHT destination (Wait, P3 is (9, 5) in my derived body list)\nP4 (9, 4)\nP5 (8, 4) - DOWN destination\nP6 (7, 4)\nP7 (7, 5) - LEFT destination\nP8 (7, 6) - Tail\n\nRecalculating collisions based on Body: [(8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (7, 6)]\n1. UP to (8, 6): Collision with P1. (If this is the prohibited \"moving directly backwards\", fatal).\n2. DOWN to (8, 4): Collision with P5. Fatal.\n3. LEFT to (7, 5): Collision with P7. Fatal.\n4. RIGHT to (9, 5): Collision with P3. Fatal.\n\nIf moving into P1 ((8, 6)) is *not* considered fatal \"moving directly backwards\" (i.e., if the rule only applies if $H_{new}$ collides with a segment *other* than P1, or if P1 is now empty space, which it isn't here), then UP is the only option.\n\nSince the rule explicitly states: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die,\" and (8, 6) *is* the cell directly behind the head (P1), I must assume UP is fatal.\n\n**If all moves are fatal based on current configuration, I seek the *least* fatal interpretation.** Moving into the cell just vacated (P1) is often allowed in standard snake physics unless the rules are exceedingly strict. Let's assume the strict interpretation first, and if that leads to guaranteed death, we must relax the interpretation to see if survival is possible.\n\n*Strict Interpretation (UP is Fatal):* Game Over (Death). This should not happen unless my strategy was flawed previously or geometry forced me here.\n\n*Relaxed Interpretation (Moving into P1 is allowed unless P1 is occupied by a fixed segment, which it is):* If we ignore the backward move restriction on P1 for a moment and just check body collisions: UP hits P1. LEFT/DOWN/RIGHT hit static internal segments P7, P5, P3. If the \"backward move\" warning applies specifically to $P1$, and $P1$ is fatal, we are dead.\n\nHowever, given that the previous move was DOWN, moving UP to (8, 6) is the reversal of that move. It is impossible to trap oneself like this in a single turn unless the target apple was located such that all other moves were blocked. My path was clearly moving towards (6, 5) which was open.\n\nLet's re-examine the board state and my body segments versus the move directions:\nHead (8, 5). We need to get to X=6, Y=5. Only LEFT (7, 5) and UP (8, 6) move towards X=6 or Y=5 respectively, but both collide fatally.\n\nIf I return to (8, 6) (UP):\nThis feels like the safest possible move if the backward collision rule isn't aggressively applied to the immediately vacated spot. If I move UP, I am essentially undoing the previous step, maintaining my position relative to the apple (6, 5) distance-wise ($\\sqrt{5}$ away).\n\nLet's proceed with the assumption that **reversing direction into the freshly vacated square is permissible/not fatal**, as all other options are definite collisions with established body segments.\n\nMove chosen: UP to (8, 6).\n\nEnemy E0 is at (1, 8). If E0 moves, say, toward (1, 9) (UP) or (0, 8) (LEFT), it remains distant.\n\nUP\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",
