After collecting the apple, I'll have a larger body, which I'll need to manage carefully in future turns.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules and win conditions:\n- All snakes move simultaneously each turn.\n- Each turn, you choose one move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Every snake's head moves one cell in its chosen direction at the same time.\n- If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point (1 apple).\n- If you move outside the board (beyond the listed coordinate ranges), you die.\n- If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\n- Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\n- If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\n- If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die (head-on collision).\n- If all snakes die on the same turn for any reason, the game ends immediately and the snake with more apples at that moment wins; if apples are tied, the game is a draw.\n- The game ends immediately when any snake reaches 50 apples. If multiple snakes reach 50 or more on the same turn, the snake with the higher apple count wins that round; if tied, it is a draw.\n- The game lasts at most 150 turns.\n- If at any point all opponents are dead and you are alive, you immediately win.\n- If multiple snakes are still alive at the final turn, the snake with the most apples wins. If apples are tied at the end of the game, the game is a draw.\n\nObjective and strategy:\n- You cannot win if you are dead, so never choose a move that obviously kills you.\n- Among the moves that keep you alive, prefer moves that both:\n  * increase your chance of safely eating apples, and\n  * keep future options open (avoid getting trapped in tight spaces or dead-ends).\n\nDecision process for each move:\n1) Consider all four directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n2) Eliminate any move that would immediately kill you (off the board, into your own body including backwards, or into another snake's body).\n3) Among remaining safe moves, favor moves that keep multiple safe follow-up moves available and move you closer to reachable apples while avoiding likely head-on collisions (remember enemy heads will also move this turn).\n\nYou may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\nYou may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\nCoordinate reminder: decreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right. Decreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nThe final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.\n\nUP",

The new head position (4,7) is not occupied by any snake. However, it doesn't directly lead to an apple.\n\n2. **Down (to (4,9))**: This move is off the board and illegal, so it's eliminated.\n\n3. **Left (to (3,8))**: Similar to moving up, this move does not put the snake's head into its own body or any other snake's body. The new head position (3,8) is not occupied. However, it also doesn't directly lead to an apple.\n\n4. **Right (to (5,8))**: The new head position (5,8) is not occupied by any snake. This move increases the snake's distance from the apples (5,1), (7,3), (8,2), (2,4), (3,4), but it's still on the board and safe.\n\nAmong these safe moves, moving up (to (4,7)) is the best choice as it keeps the snake away from the enemy and doesn't leave the board. It also keeps the snake in a position where it can potentially move towards an apple next turn.\n\nLong-term plan: Maintain a safe distance from the enemy, explore areas with apples, and avoid getting into a corner.\n\nUP",
