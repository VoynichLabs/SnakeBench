It's safe and takes me closer to the apple at (8, 7), which is the closest apple. This move also keeps me on the board and doesn't require me to move into anyone else's body.\n- RIGHT: This would move me to (9, 3). It's safe but doesn't get me any closer to an apple and could potentially put me on a collision course if the other snake moves to the right.\n- DOWN: This would move me to (8, 2). It's safe but doesn't get me any closer to an apple and could potentially put me on a collision course if the other snake moves to the right.\n- LEFT: This would move me to (7, 3). It's unsafe because it would put me on the same cell as the enemy snake, causing me to die.\n\nLong-term Plan:\n- Prioritize moving towards the apple at (8, 7) as it is the closest and provides a clear path.\n- Avoid direct confrontation with the other snake except when absolutely necessary to reach an apple.\n- Try to build a buffer of space between my snake and the enemy snake to prevent accidental collisions.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best move is to go UP as it is the only safe move that also gets me closer to an apple.\n\nUP",

Consider each direction:**  \n\nFrom (7, 3):  \n- UP \u2192 (7, 4) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7, 2) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6, 3) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8, 3) \u2013 occupied by enemy head (snake #1), would cause head-on collision if they stay still or move into same cell. But they might move away\u2014still risky because if they move onto my new head position, I die. Actually, if I move RIGHT to (8,3) and enemy moves LEFT to (7,3), we swap positions and no collision? Wait, simultaneous moves:  \n  - If I go RIGHT to (8,3) and enemy stays still (8,3), we occupy same cell \u2192 both die.  \n  - If enemy moves LEFT to (7,3) and I move RIGHT to (8,3), no collision.  \n  - If enemy moves UP/DOWN/RIGHT, I might survive unless they move onto my new cell? They can\u2019t move onto (8,3) if they start at (8,3) unless they move and return instantly\u2014impossible. Actually, if they move UP to (8,4), and I move RIGHT to (8,3), I\u2019m safe.  \nBut: if enemy moves LEFT to (7,3), I go RIGHT to (8,3), safe.  \nIf enemy stays still (8,3) and I go RIGHT to (8,3), we both die.  \nSo moving RIGHT has a chance of death if enemy stays still. Since I don\u2019t know enemy\u2019s move, this is risky. I should avoid unless it\u2019s clearly safe.  \n\nLet\u2019s check:  \nRIGHT \u2192 (8,3) \u2013 currently occupied by enemy head. That\u2019s illegal? Rule says: \u201cIf your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\u201d But enemy head is not body yet\u2014they have no body. So moving into enemy head cell is allowed, but if they stay there, heads collide and both die. So it\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nSo RIGHT is possibly lethal if enemy stays.  \n\n---\n\n**2. Eliminate immediately lethal moves:**  \n\n- RIGHT: not *immediately* lethal by board rules alone (cell occupied by enemy head is allowed), but could cause head-on collision if enemy stays. I\u2019ll count that as risky, not safe.  \n- UP, DOWN, LEFT: no walls, no bodies, safe regardless of enemy move.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Choose among safe moves:**  \n\nGoal: move toward apples, keep options open.  \n\nClosest apple by Manhattan distance:  \n- (4,2): distance |7-4|+|3-2|=3+1=4  \n- (5,6): |7-5|+|3-6|=2+3=5  \n- (1,4): |7-1|+|3-4|=6+1=7  \n- (8,7): |7-8|+|3-7|=1+4=5  \n- (4,9): |7-4|+|3-9|=3+6=9  \n\nClosest is (4,2) at distance 4.  \n\nFrom (7,3):  \n- UP to (7,4): distance to (4,2) = 3+2=5 (worse)  \n- DOWN to (7,2): distance to (4,2) = 3+0=3 (better)  \n- LEFT to (6,3): distance to (4,2) = 2+1=3 (same as DOWN)  \n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT improve equally toward closest apple (4,2).  \n\nCheck enemy proximity: enemy at (8,3) \u2013 moving DOWN to (7,2) gets me farther from enemy. Moving LEFT to (6,3) also farther. Both safe from enemy head this turn.  \n\nFuture options:  \n- DOWN to (7,2): next moves: UP back to (7,3), LEFT to (6,2), RIGHT to (8,2). Possibly 3 options next turn unless blocked by enemy.  \n- LEFT to (6,3): next moves: UP to (6,4), DOWN to (6,2), LEFT to (5,3). Also 3 options.  \n\nBoth similar. But apple at (4,2) is down-left from me. Moving DOWN gets me closer in y, moving LEFT gets me closer in x. Since both are needed, maybe alternate.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose DOWN this turn because it moves away from enemy head (8,3) slightly more directly, and apple (4,2) is down-left area.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving DOWN to (7,2), consider moving LEFT toward apple at (4,2) while watching enemy movement. Keep avoiding head-on collisions.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Their possible moves:  \nFrom (8, 6): UP\u2192(8,7) apple, DOWN\u2192(8,5) empty, LEFT\u2192(7,6) empty, RIGHT\u2192(9,6) empty.  \nThey might go UP to eat apple (8,7), or move elsewhere. They are far away, so no immediate collision risk unless we both go toward same apple.  \n\nThe nearest apples to me:  \n1. (4, 2) \u2014 Manhattan distance 1 (LEFT).  \n2. (1, 4) \u2014 distance |5-1|+|2-4|=6.  \n3. (5, 6) \u2014 distance 4.  \n4. (4, 9) \u2014 far.  \n5. (8, 7) \u2014 far.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (4, 2), I eat apple and grow to length 2 (head and new body segment). That\u2019s good. But after eating, my body will be at (5, 2) and head at (4, 2).  \n\nNext turn, from (4, 2):  \n- UP (4, 3) \u2014 empty  \n- DOWN (4, 1) \u2014 empty  \n- LEFT (3, 2) \u2014 empty  \n- RIGHT (5, 2) \u2014 my own body (deadly)  \n\nSo after eating apple, RIGHT is blocked by my own tail, but other three directions open \u2014 still safe.  \n\nIf I don\u2019t eat apple now, someone else might take it later. Enemy is far, but could move toward it eventually.  \n\nIs there a reason not to eat it immediately?  \nEating now gives me +1 apple and grows length, which could help in future collisions (longer body means more danger for enemies colliding into me). Also, apples respawn? Not mentioned, so likely finite apples \u2014 so grab nearby ones.  \n\nOther moves:  \nUP to (5, 3) \u2014 moves toward apple (5, 6) but not directly closer than staying? Actually from (5, 3), distance to (5, 6) is 3, same as from (5, 2) to (5, 6) is 4 \u2014 so slightly closer. But (4, 2) is closer than that.  \n\nDOWN to (5, 1) \u2014 moves away from most apples.  \n\nRIGHT to (6, 2) \u2014 slightly away from (4, 2).  \n\nBest move: **LEFT** to eat apple (4, 2).  \n\nPlan for next turn: After eating, avoid moving back into own body at (5, 2). Look for next nearest apple (likely (1, 4) or (5, 6)).  \n\nLEFT",

It doesn't provide an immediate advantage and could commit us to a path that might be less flexible later.\n- **RIGHT:** Moving right to (8, 6) would also align us with the apple at (8, 7) but might close off some future options as we move closer to the right edge.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving right to (8, 6) is the most advantageous move as it aligns us with the apple at (8, 7) while maintaining flexibility and avoiding edges. This keeps our options open and doesn't commit us to a specific path too quickly.\n\n**Short-term Plan:**\n\nIn the next few turns, we should continue this strategy of moving towards the apple at (8, 7) while maintaining a safe distance from the edge and other potential threats. We should be ready to adjust our path if necessary, based on the movements of Snake #0 and any new apples that appear.\n\nRIGHT",

No apple at (4, 5), so tail moves to (4, 4) and (4, 3) becomes free. So from (4, 5) possible moves: UP (4, 6), DOWN (4, 4) (safe after tail moves), LEFT (3, 5), RIGHT (5, 5). Good.\n\nFrom (3, 4): UP (3, 5), DOWN (3, 3) (safe after tail moves), LEFT (2, 4), RIGHT (4, 4) (safe after tail moves). Good.\n\nFrom (5, 4): UP (5, 5), DOWN (5, 3) (safe after tail moves), LEFT (4, 4) (safe after tail moves), RIGHT (6, 4). Good.\n\nAll safe moves keep future options open.\n\n**Step 5: Avoid head-on collision risk**\nEnemy could move to (6, 6), (8, 6), (7, 5), (7, 7). None conflict with my possible cells this turn.\n\n**Step 6: Long-term plan**\n(5, 6) is closest apple from current position, and UP or RIGHT both get me closer. UP also gets me closer to (3, 7) and keeps me central. RIGHT gets me closer to (5, 6) but away from (1, 4) and (3, 7). UP seems more flexible.\n\n**Decision**: UP\n\n**Plan for next turn**: From (4, 5), consider moving toward (5, 6) via RIGHT then UP or UP then RIGHT, while checking enemy movement.

Yes (y=7).  \n  Into my own body? My body: (4, 6), (4, 5) \u2014 no conflict.  \n  Into enemy body? Enemy body: (8, 7) \u2014 no.  \n  Safe? Yes.  \n\n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5, 5):  \n  Within board? Yes (y=5).  \n  Into my own body? My body contains (4, 5) \u2014 that\u2019s adjacent but not (5, 5). Actually, check carefully: Body is [(4, 6), (4, 5)]. (5, 5) is not in body list. So safe from self-collision.  \n  Into enemy body? No.  \n  Safe? Yes.  \n\n- **LEFT** \u2192 (4, 6):  \n  Within board? Yes.  \n  Into my own body? Body contains (4, 6) \u2014 yes, that's my first body segment (neck). Moving left from (5, 6) to (4, 6) would hit myself immediately. Not allowed.  \n  Eliminate LEFT.  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6, 6):  \n  Within board? Yes (x=6).  \n  Into my own body? No.  \n  Into enemy body? No.  \n  Safe? Yes.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**2) Consider enemy\u2019s possible moves from (9, 7):**  \nEnemy body: [(8, 7)], length 2.  \nPossible moves from (9, 7):  \n- UP to (9, 8): safe (empty board).  \n- DOWN to (9, 6): safe (empty).  \n- LEFT to (8, 7): into own body? Yes, (8, 7) is its first body segment \u2192 suicide. So enemy won\u2019t choose LEFT if rational.  \n- RIGHT off board \u2192 suicide.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, DOWN.  \nIt could move toward apple (5, 9) via UP then LEFT later, but not relevant for immediate head-on collision check because my possible moves (UP to (5, 7), DOWN to (5, 5), RIGHT to (6, 6)) are far from enemy\u2019s possible cells (9, 8) or (9, 6). No risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**3) Apples reachable:**  \nFrom (5, 6):  \n- (3, 7): UP to (5, 7), then LEFT twice? That\u2019s 2 steps away in Manhattan distance.  \n- (4, 9): UP to (5, 7), then UP twice then LEFT once \u2014 far.  \n- (5, 9): UP three steps.  \n- (1, 4): DOWN to (5, 5), then LEFT four steps \u2014 far.  \n- (1, 8): UP to (5, 7), then UP once then LEFT four steps \u2014 far.  \n\nClosest apple in moves: (3, 7) is 2 moves away: UP then LEFT. But after UP to (5, 7), next turn LEFT to (4, 7) is safe? Possibly, but need to check next turn\u2019s options.  \n\n---\n\n**4) Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n\n- **UP to (5, 7):**  \n  Next turn from (5, 7):  \n  Body will be [(5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5)] (head at (5, 7)).  \n  Possible moves: UP to (5, 8) safe, DOWN to (5, 6) safe? Wait, (5, 6) will be my neck \u2014 yes, that\u2019s my first body segment next turn, so DOWN into (5, 6) would be suicide. So DOWN not safe next turn. LEFT to (4, 7) safe (empty now), RIGHT to (6, 7) safe. So from (5, 7) next turn: safe moves UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options). Good.  \n\n- **DOWN to (5, 5):**  \n  Next turn from (5, 5): body [(5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5)] \u2192 wait, (4, 5) is my tail end, so body cells: (5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5). From (5, 5): UP to (5, 6) is neck \u2192 suicide. DOWN to (5, 4) safe. LEFT to (4, 5) is tail? Actually (4, 5) is last body segment, but moving into it kills me (rule: into any snake\u2019s body including own). So LEFT not safe. RIGHT to (6, 5) safe. So only DOWN and RIGHT safe next turn (2 options). Worse mobility.  \n\n- **RIGHT to (6, 6):**  \n  Next turn from (6, 6): body [(5, 6), (4, 6), (4, 5)].  \n  Possible moves: UP to (6, 7) safe, DOWN to (6, 5) safe, LEFT to (5, 6) is neck \u2192 suicide, RIGHT to (7, 6) safe. So safe: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options). Good.  \n\nSo DOWN leads to worse mobility next turn. UP and RIGHT give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**5) Apple proximity:**  \nUP gets me closer to apples (3, 7), (4, 9), (5, 9), (1, 8).  \nRIGHT gets me slightly further from most apples except maybe (1, 4) is not closer either.  \nUP seems better for apple-gathering.  \n\n---\n\n**6) Any danger from enemy?**  \nEnemy at (9, 7) moving UP/DOWN only, far away. No immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go UP to (5, 7), next turn I can go LEFT to (4, 7) toward apple (3, 7), or UP toward (5, 9). Keep options open. Avoid DOWN next turn because it\u2019s into neck.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP gives good mobility next turn and progresses toward nearest apples.  \n\nUP",

My possible moves: (5, 8), (4, 7), (6, 7). Enemy possible: (9, 9), (8, 8). No overlap.

Good.\n\n- **LEFT to (4, 7):**  \n  Next turn body: [(5, 7), (5, 6), (4, 6)] (tail at (4, 6)).  \n  From (4, 7):  \n  UP to (4, 8) safe.  \n  DOWN to (4, 6) tail? Wait, (4, 6) is tail end, moving into it kills me. So DOWN unsafe.  \n  LEFT to (3, 7) safe (apple there!).  \n  RIGHT to (5, 7) neck \u2192 suicide.  \n  So safe moves: UP, LEFT (2 options). Worse mobility.\n\n- **RIGHT to (6, 7):**  \n  Next turn body: [(5, 7), (5, 6), (4, 6)].  \n  From (6, 7):  \n  UP to (6, 8) safe.  \n  DOWN to (6, 6) safe.  \n  LEFT to (5, 7) neck \u2192 suicide.  \n  RIGHT to (7, 7) safe.  \n  So safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options). Good.\n\nSo LEFT reduces future mobility.\n\n---\n\n**5) Apple strategy:**  \nUP puts me at (5, 8), next turn UP to (5, 9) gets apple. That\u2019s a guaranteed apple in 2 moves (this UP, then next UP).  \nLEFT puts me at (4, 7), next turn LEFT to (3, 7) gets apple, also 2 moves.  \nBut UP gives better mobility after eating apple at (5, 9) because from (5, 9) I can go LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN (DOWN would be into neck? Let\u2019s check: if I eat apple at (5, 9), my length becomes 4, tail stays at (4, 6), body: (5, 8), (5, 7), (5, 6), (4, 6). From (5, 9), DOWN to (5, 8) is neck? Yes, (5, 8) is second segment after eating \u2192 suicide. So from (5, 9) after eating, safe moves: UP off board \u2192 no, LEFT to (4, 9) safe, RIGHT to (6, 9) safe. Actually 2 safe moves. Hmm.  \n\nFrom (3, 7) after eating apple: length 4, body: (4, 7), (5, 7), (5, 6), (4, 6). From (3, 7): UP safe, DOWN safe, LEFT safe, RIGHT to (4, 7) neck \u2192 suicide. Also 3 safe moves.  \n\nSo both apples give decent post-eating mobility.\n\n---\n\n**6) Enemy path:**  \nEnemy could go UP to (9, 9) or LEFT to (8, 8). If it goes LEFT to (8, 8), it could be moving toward (5, 9) later. If I go UP now, I race it to (5, 9) possibly. Enemy is farther: from (9, 8) to (5, 9) is 5 steps minimum, I\u2019m 2 steps away. I can win that race.\n\n---\n\n**7) Decision:**  \nUP gives good mobility now, gets me closest to apple (5, 9) in 2 moves, safe from enemy collision this turn, and keeps options open.  \nLEFT gives slightly worse mobility next turn (only 2 safe moves), though also leads to an apple.  \nRIGHT takes me away from most apples.\n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go UP to (5, 8) now, next turn I should go UP to (5, 9) to eat apple, unless enemy unexpectedly moves into (5, 9) (impossible this turn). After eating, from (5, 9) I\u2019ll have to choose LEFT or RIGHT to avoid neck collision.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP",

From (5, 9) my moves are limited (LEFT/RIGHT only), but I can go LEFT to (4, 9) (another apple) immediately next turn.\n\n---\n\n**7) Long-term plan:**  \nEat (5, 9) now \u2192 length 4. Next turn go LEFT to (4, 9) to eat another apple \u2192 length 5, then from (4, 9) I\u2019ll have more options (DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT likely safe). This quickly increases my lead.\n\n---\n\n**8) Decision:**  \nUP gets apple now, increases score to 3 vs enemy\u2019s 1, and sets up for (4, 9) next.  \nLEFT also safe with good mobility, but delays eating.  \nRIGHT safe but not helpful for apples.\n\nGiven objective: maximize apples safely, UP is best.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nIf UP now to (5, 9) and eat apple, next turn go LEFT to (4, 9) to eat again unless enemy threatens (4, 9) \u2014 but enemy is far at (8, 9) \u2192 Manhattan distance 4, so safe.\n\n---\n\nUP",

Closest apple to enemy is (9,5) far below, or (6,0) far down-left. Enemy will likely move DOWN eventually. From (8,9), enemy could go DOWN next turn to (8,8), then to (8,7) etc.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,9), I'm farther from enemy's path to (9,5), possibly safer.  \nIf I go DOWN to (4,8), I'm slightly closer to center but still safe.\n\n---\n\n**8) Decision:**  \nBoth moves are equally safe now and give same number of future safe moves.  \nGoing DOWN puts me closer to apple (3,7) in fewer moves (since from (4,8) I can go LEFT then DOWN to (3,7) in 2 turns).  \nGoing LEFT to (3,9) then DOWN to (3,8) then DOWN to (3,7) takes 3 turns to reach (3,7).  \n\nSo DOWN is slightly better for apple acquisition.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter moving DOWN to (4,8), next turn safe moves will be DOWN to (4,7) or LEFT to (3,8). Choose based on enemy position then. Target apple (3,7) via LEFT then DOWN sequence.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Good.  \n\n2. **DOWN to (3, 5)** \u2013 no apple.  \n   Next turn from (3, 5):  \n   UP \u2192 (3, 6) empty (my old head) \u2192 safe.  \n   DOWN \u2192 (3, 4) safe.  \n   LEFT \u2192 (2, 5) safe.  \n   RIGHT \u2192 (4, 5) safe.  \n   All 4 moves safe next turn \u2192 excellent flexibility.  \n\n3. **LEFT to (2, 6)** \u2013 no apple.  \n   Next turn from (2, 6):  \n   UP \u2192 (2, 7) safe.  \n   DOWN \u2192 (2, 5) safe.  \n   LEFT \u2192 (1, 6) safe.  \n   RIGHT \u2192 (3, 6) empty \u2192 safe.  \n   All 4 moves safe next turn \u2192 excellent flexibility.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Comparison**  \nRIGHT eats apple immediately, gives 3 safe moves next turn.  \nDOWN and LEFT give 4 safe moves next turn but delay apple.  \n\nGiven my apple count is 5 vs enemy\u2019s 1, I\u2019m ahead. I can afford to be slightly less aggressive. However, eating (4, 6) is very safe this turn and puts enemy further behind.  \nIf I don\u2019t eat it now, enemy could move toward it later (though enemy is far now).  \n\nAlso, after eating apple at (4, 6), my body will occupy (3, 6), blocking LEFT from my new head at (4, 6) next turn \u2014 but that\u2019s fine since I still have 3 safe moves.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan note**  \nAfter eating (4, 6), consider moving toward (1, 8) or (1, 4) while keeping space. Avoid top-right where enemy is. Enemy length 2 means it\u2019s not a big threat yet, but keep distance.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT eats apple safely, increases lead, and keeps good options.  \n\nRIGHT",

No overlap possible in one move.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nClosest apple: (1, 4) distance \u0394x=2 left, \u0394y=0 \u2192 Manhattan 2.  \n(1, 8) \u0394x=2 left, \u0394y=4 up \u2192 6.  \n(6, 0) \u0394x=3 right, \u0394y=4 down \u2192 7.  \n(9, 5) \u0394x=6 right, \u0394y=1 up \u2192 7.  \n(9, 2) \u0394x=6 right, \u0394y=2 down \u2192 8.  \n(1, 4) is closest.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move**  \n1. **UP to (3, 5)**  \n   Next from (3, 5):  \n   UP \u2192 (3, 6) my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n   DOWN \u2192 (3, 4) empty \u2192 safe.  \n   LEFT \u2192 (2, 5) safe.  \n   RIGHT \u2192 (4, 5) my body \u2192 unsafe.  \n   2 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT) \u2192 moderate flexibility.  \n\n2. **DOWN to (3, 3)**  \n   Next from (3, 3):  \n   UP \u2192 (3, 4) empty \u2192 safe.  \n   DOWN \u2192 (3, 2) safe.  \n   LEFT \u2192 (2, 3) safe.  \n   RIGHT \u2192 (4, 3) safe.  \n   4 safe moves \u2192 excellent flexibility.  \n\n3. **LEFT to (2, 4)**  \n   Next from (2, 4):  \n   UP \u2192 (2, 5) safe.  \n   DOWN \u2192 (2, 3) safe.  \n   LEFT \u2192 (1, 4) apple \u2192 safe (eating apple grows, but after eating, tail grows so next turn's mobility depends on new length).  \n   RIGHT \u2192 (3, 4) empty \u2192 safe.  \n   4 safe moves \u2192 excellent flexibility.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Strategy toward apples and safety**  \nLEFT moves directly toward apple (1, 4) and gives excellent future mobility.  \nUP is less flexible (2 safe moves next turn).  \nDOWN gives flexibility but moves away from closest apple.  \n\nMy apple lead is large (6 vs 1), so I can be careful, but grabbing nearest apple is efficient.  \nGoing LEFT to (2, 4) sets up next turn to go LEFT again to (1, 4) to eat apple, unless enemy interferes (unlikely).  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan note**  \nAfter moving LEFT to (2, 4), next turn go LEFT to (1, 4) to eat apple, then likely head DOWN or RIGHT afterward to avoid trapping myself in top-left area. Keep an eye on enemy movement; it's far away in top-right corner.  \n\nLEFT",

My lead is 7 vs 1, so I can play safe but also collect apples to end game faster.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan note**  \nAfter moving UP toward (1, 8), I should watch enemy movement and avoid trapping myself in top row. Possibly consider circling toward (6, 8) after grabbing (1, 8).  \n\n**Final choice:** UP moves toward nearest apple, keeps options open, and is safe.  \n\nUP",

All four are on-board and not occupied by my body. Enemy body at (9, 8) means RIGHT would move into its own body? Wait, enemy body is [(9, 8)] (tail), so moving RIGHT to (9, 8) is into its own tail \u2014 that would kill it per rule \u201cMoving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\u201d But moving into tail is not necessarily backwards \u2014 backwards would be into (9, 8) if head moved from (8, 8) to (9, 8) and tail is behind? Actually, enemy\u2019s body: head (8, 8), then tail (9, 8). So (9, 8) is not directly behind head (directly behind would be (9, 8) if last move was left from (9, 8)? Let\u2019s check: enemy moved last turn from (9, 8) to (8, 8)? No, last turn enemy head was (9, 8) per previous state, body [(9, 7)], so last move was DOWN to (9, 8)? Wait, earlier info: enemy head (9, 8), body [(9, 7)] in last move rationale. Now enemy head (8, 8), body [(9, 8)], so enemy moved LEFT from (9, 8) to (8, 8), tail grew? No, enemy apples: 1, length 2. So tail was (9, 7) before, after moving left to (8, 8), tail moves to (9, 8)? Actually, snake movement: head moves, each segment follows previous segment\u2019s old position. So body list updates: new head (8, 8), old head (9, 8) becomes new segment 2, old segment 2 (9, 7) is removed if no apple eaten. Enemy didn\u2019t eat apple (no apple at (8, 8)), so length stays 2, body becomes [(9, 8)]. Yes, that matches.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s possible moves now:  \n- UP (8, 9): empty.  \n- DOWN (8, 7): empty.  \n- LEFT (7, 8): empty.  \n- RIGHT (9, 8): occupied by its own body (tail). That\u2019s fatal if it moves there, so enemy likely won\u2019t choose RIGHT unless suicidal. But we can\u2019t assume they avoid suicide; they might if they don\u2019t see it. But we must consider all possibilities.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn**  \nIf I move UP to (1, 7), enemy can\u2019t reach it in one move.  \nIf I move LEFT to (0, 6), enemy can\u2019t reach it.  \nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 6), enemy can\u2019t reach it.  \nSo no immediate head-on collision possible.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nClosest apple: (1, 8) \u0394x=0, \u0394y=2 \u2192 distance 2.  \n(6, 8) \u0394x=5, \u0394y=2 \u2192 distance 7.  \n(9, 5) \u0394x=8, \u0394y=1 \u2192 distance 9.  \n(9, 2) \u0394x=8, \u0394y=4 \u2192 distance 12.  \n(6, 0) \u0394x=5, \u0394y=6 \u2192 distance 11.  \n\n(1, 8) is very close; moving UP twice gets it.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move**  \n1. **UP to (1, 7)**  \n   Next from (1, 7): UP (1, 8) has apple, DOWN (1, 6) my body, LEFT (0, 7) empty, RIGHT (2, 7) empty. So 3 safe moves next turn (UP eats apple, LEFT, RIGHT). UP leads to apple, which grows me, but after eating apple at (1, 8), my body will extend, so next turn from (1, 8): possible moves UP off board (dead), DOWN (1, 7) my new body?, LEFT (0, 8) empty, RIGHT (2, 8) empty. That\u2019s 2 safe moves. But eating apple is priority.  \n\n2. **LEFT to (0, 6)**  \n   Next from (0, 6): UP (0, 7), DOWN (0, 5), RIGHT (1, 6) my body, LEFT off board \u2192 2 safe moves. Less flexible, moves away from apple.  \n\n3. **RIGHT to (2, 6)**  \n   Next from (2, 6): UP (2, 7), DOWN (2, 5), LEFT (1, 6) my body, RIGHT (3, 6) empty \u2192 3 safe moves. Moves away from closest apple but toward center.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Strategy toward apples and safety**  \nUP gives immediate progress toward (1, 8), keeps options open (3 safe moves next turn before apple). Eating apple extends length but may reduce mobility temporarily at top row, but I can plan to turn left/right after eating to avoid dead end.  \n\nLEFT reduces options and delays apple.  \nRIGHT delays apple but keeps flexibility.  \n\nEnemy is far, not a threat now. My lead is large (7 vs 1), so I can be aggressive collecting apples.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan note**  \nMove UP toward (1, 8). Next turn, if apple still there, eat it. After eating, avoid going UP off board; turn LEFT toward (0, 8) or RIGHT toward (2, 8) to stay safe. Then consider moving toward (6, 8) or other apples. Keep distance from enemy, who is still short.  \n\n**Final choice:** UP toward nearest apple and maintains good future options.  \n\nUP",

Wait, enemy body is [(8, 8)] (tail). UP to (8, 8) is into its own body \u2192 fatal.  \nDOWN (8, 6): empty.  \nLEFT (7, 7): empty.  \nRIGHT (9, 7): empty.  \nSo enemy likely won\u2019t choose UP (suicide), but we must consider all possibilities.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Head-on collision risk this turn**  \nIf I move UP to (1, 8), enemy cannot reach (1, 8) in one move.  \nIf I move LEFT to (0, 7), enemy cannot reach it.  \nIf I move RIGHT to (2, 7), enemy cannot reach it.  \nNo immediate head-on collision possible.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity**  \nClosest apple: (1, 8) distance 1 (right above).  \nOthers: (6, 8) distance 5, (9, 5) distance 8, (9, 2) distance 9, (6, 0) distance 9.  \nUP directly eats apple.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move**  \n1. **UP to (1, 8)** \u2013 eat apple, length becomes 9. Next turn from (1, 8): UP off board (dead), DOWN (1, 7) my new body? Wait, after eating apple, my body extends: head moves to (1, 8), old head (1, 7) becomes new segment 2, old tail stays. So (1, 7) will be my body next turn. DOWN to (1, 7) would be fatal. LEFT (0, 8) empty, RIGHT (2, 8) empty \u2192 2 safe moves next turn. Eating apple is priority, and I can turn LEFT/RIGHT afterward.  \n2. **LEFT to (0, 7)** \u2013 next turn from (0, 7): UP (0, 8) empty, DOWN (0, 6) empty, RIGHT (1, 7) my body, LEFT off board \u2192 2 safe moves. Moves away from apple.  \n3. **RIGHT to (2, 7)** \u2013 next turn from (2, 7): UP (2, 8) empty, DOWN (2, 6) empty, LEFT (1, 7) my body, RIGHT (3, 7) empty \u2192 3 safe moves. Delays apple but more options.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Strategy toward apples and safety**  \nUP gives immediate apple, extends lead to 8 vs 1, but next turn only 2 safe moves (LEFT/RIGHT). That\u2019s acceptable because after eating, I can move left toward (0, 8) then down or toward other apples.  \nLEFT and RIGHT avoid apple but keep options open; however, enemy is far and short, so taking apple now is safe and increases my lead.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan note**  \nEat apple at (1, 8) this turn. Next turn, move LEFT to (0, 8) (or RIGHT to (2, 8) if LEFT looks risky) to stay safe and avoid top-edge dead end. Then consider moving toward (6, 8) or other apples while keeping distance from enemy. Maintain board control; enemy is still short and not an immediate threat.  \n\n**Final choice:** UP toward apple, grow, then maneuver away from top edge next turn.  \n\nUP",

This move allows for progression towards the apple at (9, 5) while keeping multiple safe follow-up moves available.\n\n**Short-Term Plan:**\nFor the next turn, focus on continuing to move towards the apple at (9, 5) while maintaining a safe distance from the edges and monitoring the enemy's movements.

Let's analyze the current situation and plan our next move.\n\n**Current Position:**\n- Head: (9, 6)\n- Body: [(8, 6)]\n- Apples collected: 1\n\n**Target Apples:**\n- (9, 5) (1 move away, reachable in 1 turn)\n- (9, 2) (4 moves away, requires navigation)\n- (6, 8) (5 moves away, requires navigation)\n- (6, 0) (7 moves away, requires navigation)\n- (7, 5) (4 moves away, can be reached by moving LEFT, then DOWN, then LEFT)\n\n**Safe Moves:**\n- UP to (9, 7) (safe, moves towards the center of the board)\n- DOWN to (8, 6) (safe, but moves closer to the edge)\n- LEFT to (8, 6) (safe, but moves closer to the edge)\n- RIGHT to (10, 6) (off the board, not safe)\n\n**Enemy Position:**\n- Snake #0 Head: (4, 8), Body: [(3, 8), (2, 8), (1, 8), (1, 7), (1, 6), (1, 5), (1, 4), (2, 4)]\n- No immediate threat to my current position\n\n**Analysis for the Next Move:**\n\n1. **UP to (9, 7):**\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Moves away from the edge.\n     - Keeps multiple safe follow-up moves available.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Does not progress towards any apple.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8, 6):**\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Moves to a centralized position, increasing flexibility.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Does not progress towards any apple.\n\n3. **LEFT to (8, 6):**\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Moves to a centralized position, increasing flexibility.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Does not progress towards any apple.\n\n**Strategy for the Next Few Turns:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Apple Collection:**\n   - Focus on the apple at (9, 5) due to its proximity and the safe path.\n\n2. **Avoid Edges:**\n   - Keep a safe distance from the board edges to maintain flexibility.\n\n3. **Monitor Enemy Movement:**\n   - Snake #0 is currently not a threat, but its position should be continuously monitored.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the current board state and the need to collect apples while maintaining flexibility, moving **UP** to (9, 7) is the most strategic choice. This move keeps multiple safe follow-up moves available and maintains a safe distance from the edges.\n\n**Short-Term Plan:**\nFor the next turn, focus on moving towards the apple at (9, 5) while maintaining a safe distance from the edges and monitoring the enemy's movements. Continue to keep multiple options open for future turns.\n\nUP",
