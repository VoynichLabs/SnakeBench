No body yet.  \n**Apples nearby:**  \n- (6, 7) is directly above me.  \n- (6, 8) is two above me.  \n- (6, 9) is three above me.  \n- (5, 5) is down-left.  \n- (9, 6) is far right.  \n\n**Enemy snake #0:** Head at (4, 2), no body.  \n\n**Possible moves:**  \n\n1. **UP** \u2192 (6, 7) \u2014 has an apple. Safe?  \n   - Not off board (y=7 is within 0\u20139).  \n   - No body there (I have no body yet).  \n   - Enemy body not there.  \n   - Could enemy move there? Enemy at (4, 2) can\u2019t reach (6, 7) in one move.  \n   - No head-on collision risk with enemy this turn.  \n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (6, 5) \u2014 no apple. Safe?  \n   - On board.  \n   - No body.  \n   - Enemy far away.  \n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (5, 6) \u2014 no apple. Safe?  \n   - On board.  \n   - No body.  \n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (7, 6) \u2014 no apple. Safe?  \n   - On board.  \n   - No body.  \n\nAll four moves are safe immediately.  \n\n**Considerations:**  \n- Eating an apple early grows my body, which could limit future moves but gives points.  \n- Since I have no body yet, I can safely go onto an apple without risk of trapping myself next turn.  \n- (6, 7) is an apple, so UP gives immediate growth and point.  \n- After moving UP to (6, 7), my body will be at (6, 6). Next turn, I\u2019ll have to avoid (6, 6) unless I grow again.  \n\n**Future safety after UP:**  \nFrom (6, 7) with body at (6, 6):  \n- Next turn possible moves: UP (to 6,8 apple), LEFT (5,7 empty), RIGHT (7,7 empty), DOWN (6,6 body \u2014 not allowed).  \nSo I\u2019d have 3 safe moves next turn if I go UP now. That\u2019s fine.  \n\n**Other moves** don\u2019t get an apple now, but keep all 4 directions open next turn. However, early growth is beneficial for score and doesn\u2019t yet create trapping risk.  \n\n**Head-on collision risk this turn?**  \nEnemy at (4, 2) could move:  \n- UP to (4, 3) \u2014 apple there.  \n- DOWN to (4, 1) \u2014 empty.  \n- LEFT to (3, 2) \u2014 empty.  \n- RIGHT to (5, 2) \u2014 apple there.  \nNone of these are my target cells for any of my moves, so no collision risk.  \n\n**Conclusion:** UP gets an apple safely, good for early score, and still leaves multiple options next turn.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** After eating apple at (6,7), consider moving to (6,8) for another apple if safe, or move sideways to avoid boxing in.  \n\nUP",

So only 2 safe moves next turn (LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n- **LEFT to (5, 8)** \u2014 no apple, length stays 3. Next turn body at (6, 7), (6, 6). From (5, 8): possible moves: UP (5, 9) empty, DOWN (5, 7) empty, LEFT (4, 8) empty, RIGHT (6, 8) body (dead). So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n- **RIGHT to (7, 8)** \u2014 no apple, length stays 3.

Actually apple at (3, 9) is close).  \n\nAlso, enemy is far away at (5, 3), so no immediate head-on threat next turn either.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn if I go UP:**  \nAfter eating apple at (6, 9), I\u2019ll be at length 4, body at (6, 8), (6, 7), (6, 6). Next turn only LEFT or RIGHT safe. Choose whichever leads toward more apples and away from trapping myself.  \n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nUP gives growth and maintains enough safety for now.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Actually in Snake, growth happens after move: new head at apple, tail stays same length, so body becomes 9 segments. Next turn, tail will still be at (7, 9) if no apple eaten next turn. So (9, 8) will still be my body next turn.  \n   - LEFT (8, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n   - UP/RIGHT off board \u2192 invalid.  \n   So only LEFT safe next turn. That\u2019s risky \u2014 corner with one exit.  \n\n2. **LEFT to (8, 8)** \u2013 no apple.  \n   Next turn from (8, 8):  \n   - UP (8, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n   - DOWN (8, 7) \u2192 my body (segment (8, 7) will be there next turn? Let\u2019s simulate: moving LEFT from (9, 8) to (8, 8), body shifts: new head (8, 8), then (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), tail (7, 9). So (8, 7) is body segment, so DOWN invalid.  \n   - LEFT (7, 8) \u2192 my body (segment (7, 8) in new body) \u2192 invalid.  \n   - RIGHT (9, 8) \u2192 my body (segment (9, 8) is second segment) \u2192 invalid.  \n   So only UP safe next turn. Also one exit.  \n\nBoth moves lead to only one safe move next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Which is better?**  \nUP gives an apple (score advantage) but traps me in top-right corner with only LEFT next turn.  \nLEFT gives no apple but also traps me with only UP next turn.  \n\nAfter UP then LEFT next turn, I\u2019d be at (8, 9) \u2014 still limited exits.  \nAfter LEFT then UP next turn, I\u2019d be at (8, 9) \u2014 same cell actually.  \n\nSo both sequences end at (8, 9) in two turns, but UP gets an apple now.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nTake the apple now (UP), then next turn go LEFT to (8, 9). From (8, 9) maybe more options open depending on tail movement and enemy position.  \n\nEnemy is far away at (9, 4), moving likely DOWN/LEFT, so not an immediate threat.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gets apple, increases score lead, same trap risk as LEFT but with reward.  \n\nUP",

Safe.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 9):  \nEnemy could go DOWN to (7, 3) or LEFT to (6, 4) \u2014 no overlap with (7, 9). Safe.  \n\nBoth moves are safe from immediate head-on collision.\n\n**Future moves:**  \nFrom (8, 8) next turn:  \nAdjacent cells: UP (8, 9) \u2192 my body (segment after head moves), DOWN (8, 7) \u2192 my body, LEFT (7, 8) \u2192 my body, RIGHT (9, 8) \u2192 my body.  \nWait \u2014 let's simulate:  \nIf I move DOWN to (8, 8) now, my new body becomes:  \nHead (8, 8), then (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), tail (7, 7).  \nCheck next turn from (8, 8):  \nUP (8, 9) \u2192 body segment (second segment) \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN (8, 7) \u2192 body segment (8th segment) \u2192 invalid.  \nLEFT (7, 8) \u2192 currently empty but will it be body? Let's check: after move, body segments: (8,9), (9,9), (9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (8,6), (8,7), (7,7). (7,8) is not in that list. So LEFT is empty.  \nRIGHT (9, 8) \u2192 body segment (4th segment) \u2192 invalid.  \nSo from (8, 8), only LEFT (7, 8) is safe next turn. That\u2019s a dead-end path \u2014 after that, from (7, 8) next, I\u2019d have to check but likely limited.\n\nFrom (7, 9) next turn:  \nIf I go LEFT to (7, 9) now, new body:  \nHead (7, 9), then (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7), (9, 6), (8, 6), (8, 7), tail (7, 7).  \nFrom (7, 9) next turn:  \nUP \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \nDOWN (7, 8) \u2192 empty (not in body list above).  \nLEFT (6, 9) \u2192 empty.  \nRIGHT (8, 9) \u2192 body segment (second segment) \u2192 invalid.  \nSo from (7, 9), DOWN and LEFT are safe next turn \u2014 more options.\n\n**Apples:**  \nClosest apples to (8, 9): (8, 2) far, (7, 0), (9, 1), etc.  \nFrom (7, 9), moving DOWN or LEFT next turn could eventually go toward (7, 0) or (8, 2) area.  \nFrom (8, 8), only LEFT next turn to (7, 8) then maybe DOWN to (7, 7) but that\u2019s my tail now (will move away by then). Still seems more constrained.\n\n**Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy at (7, 4) moving DOWN/LEFT is moving away from me. No immediate danger.\n\n**Decision:**  \nLEFT to (7, 9) gives more options next turn (DOWN or LEFT).  \nDOWN to (8, 8) forces only LEFT next turn, possibly trapping sooner.\n\nSo choose LEFT.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 9), likely choose DOWN to (7, 8) to start descending toward lower rows where apples are, unless LEFT (6, 9) opens more space.

UP to (3, 9) (eat apple):  \n   New length 11, tail stays (9, 7) for now.  \n   Next turn body: head (3, 9), then (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7).  \n   From (3, 9):  \n   - UP \u2192 (3, 10) off board \u2192 invalid.  \n   - DOWN \u2192 (3, 8) \u2192 body segment \u2192 invalid.  \n   - LEFT \u2192 (2, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n   - RIGHT \u2192 (4, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n   So next turn safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT (2 options).  \n\n2. DOWN to (3, 7) (eat apple):  \n   New length 11, tail stays (9, 7).  \n   Next turn body: head (3, 7), then (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7).  \n   From (3, 7):  \n   - UP \u2192 (3, 8) \u2192 body segment \u2192 invalid.  \n   - DOWN \u2192 (3, 6) \u2192 empty.  \n   - LEFT \u2192 (2, 7) \u2192 apple (2, 7) present.  \n   - RIGHT \u2192 (4, 7) \u2192 empty.  \n   So next turn safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n3. LEFT to (2, 8) (eat apple):  \n   New length 11, tail stays (9, 7).  \n   Next turn body: head (2, 8), then (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8), (9, 7).  \n   From (2, 8):  \n   - UP \u2192 (2, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n   - DOWN \u2192 (2, 7) \u2192 apple (2, 7) present.  \n   - LEFT \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 apple (1, 8) present.  \n   - RIGHT \u2192 (3, 8) \u2192 body segment \u2192 invalid.  \n   So next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy has 11 apples, I have 9. Need to catch up.  \nThe left side (columns 0\u20133) has many apples: (1, 8), (0, 6), (0, 4), (0, 3), (2, 5), (2, 2), (1, 5), (1, 2), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 6), (4, 1), etc.  \nMoving LEFT now to (2, 8) keeps me in this rich apple zone and gives me 3 options next turn, including DOWN to (2, 7) (apple) or LEFT to (1, 8) (apple).  \nUP to (3, 9) gives fewer options next turn (only LEFT/RIGHT) and might box me in top-left corner later.  \nDOWN to (3, 7) also good, but LEFT seems slightly better for accessing more apples in columns 0\u20132.  \n\nLEFT also moves me away from enemy\u2019s area (bottom right).  \n\n**Strategy note for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 8), consider going LEFT to (1, 8) (apple) or DOWN to (2, 7) (apple). Avoid moving into body. Keep expanding in left side apple zone while monitoring enemy movement from bottom right.  \n\nLEFT",

RIGHT to (3, 6) (eat apple):  \n   Length becomes 13, tail stays (9, 8).  \n   New body: head (3, 6), then (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8), (7, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9), (9, 8).  \n   From (3, 6):  \n   - UP \u2192 (3, 7) \u2192 apple (3, 7) present.  \n   - DOWN \u2192 (3, 5) \u2192 empty.  \n   - LEFT \u2192 (2, 6) \u2192 body segment \u2192 invalid.  \n   - RIGHT \u2192 (4, 6) \u2192 empty.  \n   So next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy has 13 apples, I have 11. Need to catch up.  \nAll three safe moves give good future apple access.  \nDOWN gives apple now at (2, 5) and next turn LEFT to (1, 5) apple.  \nLEFT gives no apple now but next turn DOWN to (1, 5) apple or LEFT to (0, 6) apple.  \nRIGHT gives apple now at (3, 6) and next turn UP to (3, 7) apple.  \n\nEnemy is confined to UP only this turn, so no immediate threat.  \nI want to maximize apple eating while keeping options open.  \nLEFT delays apple by one turn but puts me near (0, 6), (1, 5), (0, 4), (0, 3) cluster.  \nRIGHT puts me near (3, 7), (3, 9), (2, 2), (4, 1) apples.  \nDOWN keeps me central.  \n\nGiven enemy is far in bottom right, I can safely eat in left side.  \nLEFT now \u2192 next turn DOWN to (1, 5) apple \u2192 then possibly LEFT to (0, 5) empty but then to (0, 4) apple. That\u2019s a good path.  \n\nBut DOWN now also good: apple now, then next turn LEFT to (1, 5) apple. That\u2019s two apples in two turns.  \nLEFT now gives apple next turn (1, 5) but not this turn, so slower.  \nRIGHT now gives apple now and next turn UP to (3, 7) apple, but moves me away from left cluster.  \n\nI prefer DOWN for immediate apple and still good options.  \n\n**Strategy note for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 5), consider LEFT to (1, 5) apple, or DOWN to (2, 4) empty, or RIGHT to (3, 5) empty.  \nEnemy at (8, 3) next turn, still far.

(empty).  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 4) \u2192 board shows 'A' (apple).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 5) \u2192 board shows '.' (empty).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 5) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Enemy snake #0:**  \nHead: (9, 3)  \nBody: [(8, 3), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4)]  \n\nFrom (9, 3), enemy\u2019s possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (9, 4) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 2) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 3) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board (x=10) \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo enemy has **no safe moves** and will die this turn unless I\u2019m missing something. Wait \u2014 check again:  \nEnemy body list: (8,3) is directly behind head (9,3) so LEFT is invalid. UP (9,4) is in body list. DOWN (9,2) is in body list. RIGHT is off board. Yes, all moves are fatal.  \n\nThat means snake #0 dies this turn.  \n\nIf snake #0 dies, I win immediately if I survive this turn (since all opponents are dead).  \n\nSo my only goal is to survive this turn \u2014 no need to chase apples.  \n\n**Check each safe move for immediate death:**  \n- UP (1,6): empty, no enemy body there (enemy body is far right), safe.  \n- DOWN (1,4): apple, safe, will grow to length 14.  \n- LEFT (0,5): empty, safe.  \n\nAll three are safe.  \n\nSince enemy dies regardless, I can pick any. But if I eat apple now, I get +1 apple (14 vs 13 for enemy when it dies). That\u2019s better for tie-breaking if needed.  \n\nAlso, after eating apple, my tail stays at (9,8) for one more turn, so length 14 next turn.  \n\n**Future safety:**  \nFrom (1,4) after eating apple:  \n- UP \u2192 (1,5) \u2192 my body (old head position) \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 apple.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,4) \u2192 empty.  \nSo next turn I\u2019d have 3 safe moves.  \n\nFrom (1,6):  \n- UP \u2192 (1,7) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1,5) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0,6) \u2192 apple.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo next turn 2 safe moves.  \n\nFrom (0,5):  \n- UP \u2192 (0,6) \u2192 apple.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0,4) \u2192 apple.  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,5) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo next turn 2 safe moves.  \n\nDOWN gives more future options and an extra apple.  \n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:**  \nIf I go DOWN now to (1,4) and eat apple, next turn I can go LEFT to (0,4) apple or DOWN to (1,3) empty or RIGHT to (2,4) empty. Enemy dead, so just avoid trapping myself.  \n\nGiven enemy dies now, I win after this turn if I survive. So safest is DOWN (eat apple, more future space) or LEFT/UP (avoid growth if worried about space, but growth fine here).  \n\nI\u2019ll take the apple for score.  \n\nDOWN",

(empty).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 4) \u2192 board shows 'A' (apple).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 board shows '.' (empty).  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Enemy snake #0:**  \nHead: (9, 4)  \nBody: [(9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4)]  \n\nFrom (9, 4), enemy\u2019s possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (9, 5) \u2192 board shows '.' (empty).  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 3) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 4) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo enemy only safe move is UP to (9, 5).  \n\n**Check if enemy dies last turn?**  \nLast turn enemy head was at (9, 3) with body: (8,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,1), (8,1), (8,0), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,4), (9,4).  \nFrom (9,3): UP (9,4) body, DOWN (9,2) body, LEFT (8,3) body, RIGHT off board \u2192 all invalid.  \nSo enemy should have died last turn.  \n\nBut the current state shows enemy alive at (9,4) with body shifted. That means my earlier reasoning was wrong \u2014 maybe enemy\u2019s body list order was tail-first? Wait, the rules say \u201cAll snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one, and the last tuple is the tail.\u201d  \n\nLet\u2019s check: Last turn enemy head: (9,3), body: [(8,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,1), (8,1), (8,0), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,4), (9,4)].  \nThat means (8,3) is directly behind head, so moving LEFT into (8,3) is invalid. But maybe the game allows moving into the tail if the tail moves away? No \u2014 rule says: \u201cMoving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\u201d That\u2019s only for backwards move.  \n\nBut UP from (9,3) to (9,4) is in body list (last element (9,4)), so invalid. DOWN to (9,2) is in body list. LEFT to (8,3) is in body list. RIGHT off board. So indeed all moves fatal.  \n\nYet enemy is alive now. Possibly I misread the board \u2014 maybe enemy\u2019s body list last turn was actually [(9,4), (9,3), (8,3), \u2026]? Let\u2019s check last turn\u2019s given data:  \nLast turn enemy head: (9, 3), Body: [(8, 3), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4)].  \nYes, (9,4) is last in list, so it\u2019s the tail. That means moving UP from (9,3) to (9,4) would be moving into the tail cell. But tails move each turn unless snake grows. If enemy didn\u2019t eat an apple, tail (9,4) would move to (8,4)? Wait, but body segments follow the head\u2019s old positions. If enemy moved UP to (9,4), the tail (9,4) would shift off that cell. So moving into current tail cell is allowed if tail moves away that same turn.  \n\nThat\u2019s the key: The rule says \u201cIf your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\u201d But \u201cbody\u201d means positions before movement. The tail cell before movement is part of body, so moving into it is fatal unless it\u2019s no longer part of body after movement (which only happens if you move into the tail and the tail moves away because no growth). But simultaneous movement means at the moment of movement, the tail is still there, so collision occurs. However, some Snake game implementations treat tail as not collidable if the snake is moving forward (because tail moves forward simultaneously). But given the rules here explicitly say \u201cincluding your own\u201d, I should assume tail counts as body for collision.  \n\nBut then enemy had no valid move last turn. Yet enemy is alive now, so maybe the game does allow moving into your own tail if it will move away. That must be the case.  \n\nSo enemy likely moved UP from (9,3) to (9,4) (tail) last turn and survived because tail moved to (8,4). That matches current enemy body: head (9,4), body: [(9,3), (8,3), \u2026 (8,4)] \u2014 yes, (8,4) is last in current list, so tail moved from (9,4) to (8,4).  \n\nSo enemy is alive.  \n\n**Now check head-on collision risk:**  \nEnemy\u2019s only safe move is UP to (9,5). My possible moves:  \n- DOWN to (1,3) \u2014 far from enemy.  \n- LEFT to (0,4) \u2014 far.  \n- RIGHT to (2,4) \u2014 far.  \n\nNo risk of head-on collision this turn.  \n\n**Future safety:**  \nFrom (1,3):  \n- UP \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 my body (old head) \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 apple.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0,3) \u2192 apple.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 apple.  \nAll three possible moves except UP lead to apples.  \n\nFrom (0,4) after eating apple:  \n- UP \u2192 (0,5) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0,3) \u2192 apple.  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.  \nSo 2 safe moves.  \n\nFrom (2,4):  \n- UP \u2192 (2,5) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 apple.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,4) \u2192 apple.  \nSo 2 safe moves.  \n\nAll are safe this turn.  \n\n**Apples:**  \nLEFT (0,4) gets apple, grows to length 15.  \nRIGHT (2,4) empty now, but next to apples.  \nDOWN (1,3) empty now, but next to apples.  \n\nSince enemy is still alive, I should keep growing to reach 50 apples for win condition.  \n\nLEFT gets apple immediately and leaves me at board edge \u2014 slightly limiting but okay short-term.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is on right side (9,4) moving to (9,5). I\u2019m on left side. We\u2019re far apart. I should eat apples on left side while keeping space.  \n\nLEFT gets apple at (0,4), then next turn from (0,4) I can go UP to (0,5) empty or DOWN to (0,3) apple.  \n\nI\u2019ll take the apple now.  \n\nLEFT",

No risk.  \n\n**Future safety:**  \nFrom (0, 2) if I go DOWN:  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 3) \u2192 my body (old head) \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (0, 1) \u2192 board shows '.' (empty).  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 board shows 'A' (apple).  \nSo safe moves next turn: DOWN, RIGHT (RIGHT eats apple).  \n\nFrom (1, 3) if I go RIGHT:  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 4) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 2) \u2192 board shows 'A' (apple).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 3) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 3) \u2192 board shows 'A' (apple).  \nSo safe moves next turn: DOWN (eats apple), RIGHT (eats apple).  \n\nBoth options give two safe moves next turn, but RIGHT puts me at (1, 3) with apples at (1, 2) and (2, 3) adjacent.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nApples nearby: (1, 2) is adjacent to (1, 3) if I go RIGHT now, or reachable next turn if I go DOWN now.  \nAlso (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 0), (4, 1), (4, 4) are in the left/middle area.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is on the right side, I\u2019m on the left. I should eat apples in columns 0\u20134 while keeping space.  \nGoing RIGHT now to (1, 3) gives me two apple-adjacent moves next turn and opens more central area.  \nGoing DOWN now to (0, 2) keeps me in left column with fewer future options (only rightward exits).  \n\nBetter to move RIGHT to (1, 3) to get into a more open area with multiple apples nearby.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 3), choose between DOWN to (1, 2) (apple) or RIGHT to (2, 3) (apple) depending on enemy position. Avoid moving toward enemy unless necessary.  \n\nRIGHT",

Both lead to apples.  \n\n**Enemy snake #0:**  \nHead: (9, 7)  \nBody: [(9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (9, 2), (9, 1), (8, 1), (8, 0), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 2), (7, 3)]  \n\nFrom (9, 7), enemy\u2019s possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (9, 8) \u2192 board shows 'T' (my tail) \u2014 but my tail is at (9, 9) and (8, 9) and (7, 9) etc. Wait, check board: row 9 col 8 is 'T' (my tail segment at (8, 9)? Actually board row 9 col 8 is '.'? Let's check carefully:  \n\nBoard row 9 (top row):  \ncol 0: '.'  \ncol 1: 'A'  \ncol 2: '.'  \ncol 3: 'A'  \ncol 4: '.'  \ncol 5: 'A'  \ncol 6: '.'  \ncol 7: 'T' (my body at (7, 9))  \ncol 8: 'T' (my body at (8, 9))  \ncol 9: 'T' (my body at (9, 9))  \n\nSo (9, 8) is 'T' (my body). So enemy UP to (9, 8) \u2192 hits my body \u2192 enemy dies.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9, 6) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8, 7) \u2192 board shows '.' (empty).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is LEFT to (8, 7).  \n\n**Head-on collision risk:**  \nMy DOWN (1, 2) and RIGHT (2, 3) are far from (8, 7). No risk.  \n\n**Future safety after each move:**  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (1, 2) (eat apple \u2192 length 18):  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 my old head position (now empty next turn) \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 1) \u2192 board shows '.' (empty).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 2) \u2192 board shows '.' (empty).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 board shows 'A' (apple).  \nSo three safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT), one apple move (RIGHT).  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 3) (eat apple \u2192 length 18):  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 board shows '.' (empty).  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 2) \u2192 board shows 'A' (apple).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 3) \u2192 my old head position \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 3) \u2192 board shows '.' (empty).  \nSo all four moves safe, two lead to apples.  \n\nRIGHT gives more options next turn.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is stuck on right side with only one safe move (LEFT to (8, 7)). I can eat apples in middle/left area.  \nRIGHT to (2, 3) opens more central space and keeps flexibility.  \nAlso, if enemy moves LEFT to (8, 7), it\u2019s still far from me.  \n\nI should avoid moving toward enemy unnecessarily, but here both moves are safe. RIGHT is better for future mobility.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 3), choose between DOWN to (2, 2) (apple), UP to (2, 4) (empty), RIGHT to (3, 3) (empty), or LEFT to (1, 3) (empty).  \nPrefer DOWN to eat apple (2, 2) unless enemy gets too close.  \n\nRIGHT",

That\u2019s inconsistent \u2014 maybe body list excludes initial segments? Let's check: body list length = 17, plus head = 18 total segments. So maybe initial length was 2? Let's trust the body list length: head + 17 body = 18 segments total. That means apples collected 17 \u2192 length 18, so initial length was 1?

RIGHT to (3, 3) also good but doesn\u2019t eat apple now.  \nEating apple now gets me closer to 50 and grows length, but also reduces apple count on board.  \n\nCheck board: apples at (2, 2) and (1, 2) nearby. If I go DOWN to (2, 2), next turn I can go LEFT to (1, 2) for another apple. That\u2019s efficient.  \n\nEnemy is far, so no immediate threat.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nDOWN gives apple now and maximum future options.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2, 2), consider eating (1, 2) apple next if safe, else go to (2, 1) or (3, 2) to stay mobile.

That keeps mobility high and collects apples soon.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nDOWN maximizes future options and positions for two apples next turn.  \n\nDOWN",

No immediate collision risk.  \n\n**Future safety after each move:**  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (0, 0) (eat apple):  \n- UP \u2192 (0, 1) \u2192 board shows \u2018.\u2019 (empty).  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (1, 0) \u2192 old head \u2192 safe.  \nSo next turn safe moves: UP, RIGHT (2 options).  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (2, 0) (eat apple):  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 1) \u2192 my body \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 0) \u2192 old head \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 0) \u2192 board shows \u2018A\u2019 (apple).  \nSo next turn safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT (2 options).  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nBoth moves eat an apple now.  \nLEFT (0,0) \u2192 next turn only UP (0,1) or RIGHT (1,0). UP (0,1) is empty, but then I\u2019m near top-left corner with limited exits.  \nRIGHT (2,0) \u2192 next turn LEFT (1,0) or RIGHT (3,0) apple. RIGHT (3,0) apple is good, but then I\u2019m near bottom edge.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019m at 19 apples, enemy at 15. Eating either apple gets me to 20.  \nFrom (2,0), next turn I can go RIGHT to (3,0) apple, then maybe up along column 3 where there are more apples (3,4), (3,6), (3,7), (3,9). That path seems to have more apples accessible without trapping myself immediately.  \nFrom (0,0), I\u2019d go to (0,1) then maybe (0,2) empty, but then I\u2019m near my body at (0,3) and (1,3) \u2014 could get boxed in.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT \u2014 gets apple now, and next turn I can go RIGHT to (3,0) apple, keeping a path toward center/apple-rich columns 3\u20134.  \n\nRIGHT",

Wait, my body after move: head (4, 1), then (3, 1), then (3, 0), then (2, 0)\u2026 so (4, 0) is not in my body \u2014 but board shows \u2018.\u2019 at (4, 0) currently. Actually after move, (4, 0) is still empty, but (3, 0) is my body. So DOWN to (4, 0) is safe.  \n   - LEFT \u2192 (3, 1) \u2192 my body (second segment) \u2192 invalid.  \n   - RIGHT \u2192 (5, 1) \u2192 board shows \u2018.\u2019 empty.  \n   So next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\nBoth give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n- UP (3, 2) \u2192 no apple now, but closer to apples at (3, 4), (2, 4), (4, 4), (3, 9), etc.  \n- RIGHT (4, 1) \u2192 eat apple immediately, grow to 23 length.  \n\nEating an apple now increases my lead (22 vs enemy 18 apples after this turn if I eat).  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI\u2019m longer than enemy, so head-on collisions favor me if equal length? Actually head-on kills both regardless of length. But eating apple now puts me at 22 apples vs enemy 18.  \n\nEnemy is in top right area, I\u2019m lower center-left. Eating the apple at (4, 1) is safe and gives score. Then from (4, 1) I can go UP to (4, 2) toward more apples at (4, 4), (3, 4), etc.  \n\nGoing UP to (3, 2) delays eating but keeps path open.  \n\nGiven the objective is to reach 50 apples, eating now is beneficial. Also, enemy might move toward apples at (6, 4), (7, 5), etc., not immediately threatening me.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT to eat apple, grow, and keep options open.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (4, 1), consider going UP to (4, 2) to approach center apples, avoid going LEFT into body. Watch enemy\u2019s move from (4, 6) \u2014 they might go DOWN to (4, 5) or RIGHT to (5, 6), not an immediate threat.  \n\nRIGHT",

Wait \u2014 count: head (5,1) + 22 body = 23 total. Actually apples collected = 23 means length = 24? Let\u2019s check: apples collected is 23, so length should be apples + 1 = 24. But my body list has 22 entries after head, so total segments = 23. That means I must have grown last turn? Yes, last turn I ate an apple at (5,1), so my length increased by 1. But the body list given now still shows 22 body segments after head, so total = 23. That means apples collected should be 22? Let\u2019s verify: initial length = 1, each apple adds 1 segment. If apples = 23, length = 24. But here length = 23, so apples = 22. The state says apples collected: 23 \u2014 maybe a mismatch? Possibly the body list is from before growth? Actually the board shows my head at (5,1) with \u20181\u2019, and body behind. Let\u2019s trust the given: apples = 23, length = 23 (head + 22 body). That means I started with length 1, ate 22 apples to reach length 23. But they say apples collected = 23, so maybe length = 24. Let\u2019s count body list:  \nBody: 4,1; 3,1; 3,0; 2,0; 1,0; 1,1; 2,1; 2,2; 2,3; 1,3; 0,3; 0,4; 1,4; 1,5; 2,5; 2,6; 2,7; 2,8; 3,8; 4,8; 5,8; 6,8; 7,8 \u2192 that\u2019s 23 body segments?

RIGHT gives immediate growth and keeps 3 safe moves. UP gives 4 safe moves but no immediate apple. DOWN gives 3 safe moves but no immediate apple.  \n\nRIGHT seems best for score. But check enemy\u2019s position: enemy at (4,4) might go LEFT to (3,4) to eat apple, moving away from me. If I go RIGHT to (6,1), I\u2019ll be near apples at (6,2), (6,0), (7,0), (6,4), (6,6).  \n\nAlso, my tail is at (7,8) \u2014 far away, so body won\u2019t trap me soon.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT to eat apple, grow, then next turn from (6,1) I can go UP to (6,2) for another apple or DOWN to (6,0) for apple, depending on enemy position.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,1), if enemy is far, consider UP to (6,2) to eat apple and move toward center. Avoid moving into confined spaces.  \n\nRIGHT",

Let\u2019s check: body list length 19, plus head = 20. So apples = 19. Possibly a mismatch, but not critical.)  \n\n**Apples nearby:**  \n- (6, 2) up from head  \n- (6, 0) down from head  \n- (7, 0) down-right  \n- (6, 4) up a bit  \n- (5, 6) far  \n- (6, 6) far  \n\n**Possible moves from my head (6, 1):**  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 2) \u2192 apple (A) \u2192 safe (not occupied by any snake body)  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 0) \u2192 apple (A) \u2192 safe  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 1) \u2192 my body (second segment) \u2192 invalid  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 1) \u2192 board shows \u2018.\u2019 empty \u2192 safe  \n\nAll three safe moves lead to apples except RIGHT (empty).  \n\n**Enemy\u2019s possible moves from (3, 4):**  \n- UP \u2192 (3, 5) \u2192 board \u2018.\u2019 empty  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 3) \u2192 board \u2018.\u2019 empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 4) \u2192 apple (A)  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 4) \u2192 enemy\u2019s own body (second segment) \u2192 invalid  \n\nSo enemy safe: UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n**Head-on collision risk this turn:**  \nIf I go UP to (6, 2), enemy could go UP to (3, 5) \u2014 no conflict.  \nIf I go DOWN to (6, 0), enemy could go DOWN to (3, 3) \u2014 no conflict.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 1), enemy could go DOWN/UP/LEFT \u2014 no conflict.  \nNo immediate head-on risk.  \n\n**Future safety after each move:**  \n\n1. **UP to (6, 2) (eat apple, grow to length 25):**  \n   New head at (6, 2). Next turn possible moves:  \n   - UP \u2192 (6, 3) \u2192 \u2018.\u2019 empty  \n   - DOWN \u2192 (6, 1) \u2192 my old head (safe)  \n   - LEFT \u2192 (5, 2) \u2192 \u2018.\u2019 empty  \n   - RIGHT \u2192 (7, 2) \u2192 \u2018.\u2019 empty  \n   All 4 safe.  \n\n2. **DOWN to (6, 0) (eat apple, grow to length 25):**  \n   New head at (6, 0). Next turn possible moves:  \n   - UP \u2192 (6, 1) \u2192 my old head (safe)  \n   - DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 invalid  \n   - LEFT \u2192 (5, 0) \u2192 \u2018.\u2019 empty  \n   - RIGHT \u2192 (7, 0) \u2192 apple (A)  \n   Safe: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options).  \n\n3. **RIGHT to (7, 1) (no apple):**  \n   New head at (7, 1). Next turn possible moves:  \n   - UP \u2192 (7, 2) \u2192 \u2018.\u2019 empty  \n   - DOWN \u2192 (7, 0) \u2192 apple (A)  \n   - LEFT \u2192 (6, 1) \u2192 my old head (safe)  \n   - RIGHT \u2192 (8, 1) \u2192 enemy body (last segment of enemy) \u2192 invalid (enemy tail at (8,1)? Wait, enemy body list ends with (8,1) as last body segment, so (8,1) is occupied next turn unless enemy moves tail away. But enemy moves this turn, so tail will shift. Let\u2019s check: enemy head at (3,4), body: (4,4), (4,5), \u2026 (8,1). If enemy moves, tail (8,1) will move to (9,1)? Actually tail is at (8,1) now. After enemy moves, tail will shift forward one cell along body path, so (8,1) may become free if enemy doesn\u2019t grow. Enemy not eating apple this turn unless they go LEFT to (2,4) apple. If enemy eats apple, tail stays at (8,1). If enemy doesn\u2019t eat apple, tail moves to (9,1)? Let\u2019s trace enemy body: head (3,4), then (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,1), (8,1) as last? Wait, list ends with (8,1) after (9,1)? Actually given: Body: [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (3,6), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (8,2), (9,2), (9,1), (8,1)]  \n   So last body segment is (8,1), second last is (9,1). That means tail is at (8,1), preceding segment is (9,1). So after enemy moves without eating apple, tail will move to (9,1), freeing (8,1). So (8,1) could be safe next turn. But uncertain. Safer to assume (8,1) may be occupied if enemy eats apple. So RIGHT now to (7,1) gives next turn RIGHT risky. Better to avoid.)  \n\nGiven uncertainty, eating apples is beneficial for score and length advantage.  \n\n**Choice:**  \nUP and DOWN both eat apples and keep good options. UP gives 4 safe moves next turn, DOWN gives 3 safe moves next turn. UP moves toward center, DOWN moves to bottom edge (limits DOWN moves later).  \n\nUP seems better for mobility.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEat apples while maintaining space. From (6,2) next turn, consider moving toward (6,4) apple or (7,5) apple, but watch enemy\u2019s position. Avoid trapping myself in my long body \u2014 tail is far away at (7,8), so not an immediate concern.  \n\n**Decision:**  \nUP to eat apple and maximize future options.  \n\nUP",

LEFT leads toward (3, 2) apple (but enemy might go there this turn). RIGHT leads toward (7, 5) apple later.  \n\n**Enemy\u2019s likely move:**  \nEnemy at (3, 3) can eat apple at (3, 2) by going DOWN. That\u2019s likely because it\u2019s safe and grows them. If enemy eats apple, their tail stays at (8, 1), so (8, 2) remains occupied next turn.  \n\n**Best choice:**  \nUP gives most future options and sets up for (6, 4) apple next turn. LEFT also safe but fewer next-move options. RIGHT risks running into enemy body next turn.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nFrom (6, 3), next turn go UP to (6, 4) to eat apple, then assess. Keep moving toward center/apple clusters while avoiding trapping myself. My tail is at (7, 8), so body loops around top-right; be careful not to circle myself into dead ends.  \n\nUP",

No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No (enemy body at (6, 7) is not (6, 6)).  \n   - Head-on collision risk: Enemy at (5, 2) could go UP to (5, 3) (empty), DOWN to (5, 1) (empty), LEFT to (4, 2) (enemy body), RIGHT to (6, 2) (my body at (6, 2)). So enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, DOWN.  \n     Enemy cannot reach (6, 6) in one move from (5, 2). No head-on risk.  \n   - Safe? Yes.  \n\n2. **DOWN** to (6, 4):  \n   - Occupied by my body (second segment) \u2192 death. Eliminate.  \n\n3. **LEFT** to (5, 5):  \n   - On board: yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n   - Head-on risk: Enemy cannot reach (5, 5) from (5, 2) in one move. Safe.  \n\n4. **RIGHT** to (7, 5):  \n   - On board: yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n   - Head-on risk: Enemy cannot reach (7, 5) from (5, 2) in one move. Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Apple eating:**  \n- UP (6, 6) \u2192 apple \u2192 grow to 28 segments, score 27 apples.  \n- RIGHT (7, 5) \u2192 apple \u2192 grow to 28 segments, score 27 apples.  \n- LEFT (5, 5) \u2192 no apple.  \n\nSo UP and RIGHT both give an apple.  \n\n**Next turn safety after each apple move:**  \n\nIf **UP** to (6, 6) and eat apple:  \nNew head at (6, 6), new tail stays where it was (old tail at (5, 8) moves? Wait, growth means tail stays in place this turn, so body length increases by 1, tail remains at (5, 8) until next move.  \nNext turn from (6, 6):  \n- UP (6, 7) \u2192 enemy body (enemy segment at (6, 7)) \u2192 dangerous.  \n- DOWN (6, 5) \u2192 empty (my old head position).  \n- LEFT (5, 6) \u2192 apple (A).  \n- RIGHT (7, 6) \u2192 empty.  \nSo one dangerous move (UP), but others safe.  \n\nIf **RIGHT** to (7, 5) and eat apple:  \nNew head at (7, 5), tail stays at (5, 8).  \nNext turn from (7, 5):  \n- UP (7, 6) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN (7, 4) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (6, 5) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (8, 5) \u2192 empty.  \nAll 4 safe next turn.  \n\n**Enemy\u2019s possible moves this turn:**  \nFrom (5, 2):  \n- UP (5, 3) empty  \n- DOWN (5, 1) empty  \n- LEFT (4, 2) enemy body  \n- RIGHT (6, 2) my body  \nSo enemy likely UP or DOWN.  \n\nIf enemy goes UP to (5, 3), they\u2019re moving away from me. If DOWN to (5, 1), also away.  \n\n**Long-term:**  \nI have 26 apples, need 50. Eating apples quickly is good, but must avoid dead ends.  \nMy body blocks much of left side. Right side has more open space.  \nRIGHT (7, 5) gives apple and leaves all 4 directions open next turn.  \nUP (6, 6) gives apple but next turn UP is blocked by enemy body, slightly riskier.  \n\nLEFT (5, 5) gives no apple, less desirable.  \n\n**Best choice:** RIGHT to (7, 5) \u2014 eat apple, stay safe, keep options open.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 5), assess apples at (7, 6), (6, 6), (8, 5), etc. Avoid moving toward enemy body at (6, 7) and (7, 7). Likely go UP to (7, 6) or DOWN to (7, 4) to stay in open right side.  \n\nRIGHT",

No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No (enemy body at (7, 7) is not (7, 6)).  \n   - Head-on collision risk: Enemy at (5, 3) could go UP (5, 4) empty, DOWN (5, 2) enemy body, LEFT (4, 3) empty, RIGHT (6, 3) my body. So enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, LEFT.  \n     Enemy cannot reach (7, 6) in one move from (5, 3). Safe.  \n\n2. **DOWN** to (7, 4):  \n   - On board: yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n   - Head-on risk: Enemy cannot reach (7, 4) in one move. Safe.  \n\n3. **LEFT** to (6, 5):  \n   - Occupied by my body (second segment) \u2192 death. Eliminate.  \n\n4. **RIGHT** to (8, 5):  \n   - On board: yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n   - Head-on risk: Enemy cannot reach (8, 5) in one move. Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n**Apple eating:**  \n- RIGHT (8, 5) \u2192 apple \u2192 grow to 28 segments, score 28 apples.  \n- UP (7, 6) \u2192 no apple.  \n- DOWN (7, 4) \u2192 no apple.  \n\n**Next turn safety after each move:**  \n\nIf **RIGHT** to (8, 5) and eat apple:  \nNew head at (8, 5), tail stays at (5, 8).  \nNext turn from (8, 5):  \n- UP (8, 6) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN (8, 4) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (7, 5) \u2192 empty (old head position).  \n- RIGHT (9, 5) \u2192 enemy body (enemy at (9, 5)) \u2192 dangerous.  \nSo 3 safe moves, 1 dangerous.  \n\nIf **UP** to (7, 6) no apple:  \nTail moves to (4, 8) (since no growth), so body length stays 27.  \nNext turn from (7, 6):  \n- UP (7, 7) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 dangerous.  \n- DOWN (7, 5) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (6, 6) \u2192 apple (A).  \n- RIGHT (8, 6) \u2192 empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves, 1 dangerous.  \n\nIf **DOWN** to (7, 4) no apple:  \nTail moves to (4, 8).  \nNext turn from (7, 4):  \n- UP (7, 5) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN (7, 3) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (6, 4) \u2192 my body (segment at (6, 4)) \u2192 dangerous.  \n- RIGHT (8, 4) \u2192 empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves, 1 dangerous.  \n\nAll safe moves give 3 safe options next turn.  \n\n**Enemy\u2019s possible moves this turn:**  \nFrom (5, 3):  \n- UP (5, 4) empty  \n- DOWN (5, 2) enemy body (its own second segment) \u2192 death  \n- LEFT (4, 3) empty  \n- RIGHT (6, 3) my body \u2192 death  \nSo enemy\u2019s only safe moves: UP, LEFT.  \n\nIf enemy goes UP to (5, 4), moves away from me. If LEFT to (4, 3), also away.  \n\n**Long-term:**  \nI have 27 apples, need 50. Eating apples quickly is good.  \nRIGHT gives an apple and keeps good options.  \nUP and DOWN give no apple but keep similar future safety.  \n\nGiven my lead (27 vs 22), I can be slightly conservative, but eating apples faster helps reach 50 sooner.  \nRIGHT (8, 5) also moves me into a less crowded area (right side) away from enemy\u2019s likely path.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 5) after eating apple, avoid RIGHT into enemy body at (9, 5). Consider UP to (8, 6) or DOWN to (8, 4) to stay in open area. Possibly aim for apple at (7, 6) or (6, 6) later.  \n\n**Best choice:** RIGHT to (8, 5) \u2014 eat apple, maintain safe future options.  \n\nRIGHT",

No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n   - Head-on collision risk: Enemy at (5, 4) could go UP (5, 5) empty, DOWN (5, 3) enemy body, LEFT (4, 4) enemy body, RIGHT (6, 4) my body.  \n     Enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP only.  \n     Enemy cannot reach (8, 6) in one move. Safe.  \n\n2. **DOWN** to (8, 4):  \n   - On board: yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n   - Head-on risk: Enemy cannot reach (8, 4) in one move. Safe.  \n\n3. **LEFT** to (7, 5):  \n   - Occupied by my body (second segment) \u2192 death. Eliminate.  \n\n4. **RIGHT** to (9, 5):  \n   - Occupied by enemy body (segment at (9, 5)) \u2192 death. Eliminate.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN.  \n\n**Apple eating:**  \n- UP (8, 6) \u2192 no apple.  \n- DOWN (8, 4) \u2192 no apple.  \n\n**Next turn safety after each move:**  \n\nIf **UP** to (8, 6) no apple:  \nTail moves to (4, 8) (since no growth), body length stays 28.  \nNext turn from (8, 6):  \n- UP (8, 7) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 dangerous.  \n- DOWN (8, 5) \u2192 empty (old head position).  \n- LEFT (7, 6) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (9, 6) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 dangerous.  \nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT (2 safe moves).  \n\nIf **DOWN** to (8, 4) no apple:  \nTail moves to (4, 8).  \nNext turn from (8, 4):  \n- UP (8, 5) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN (8, 3) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 dangerous.  \n- LEFT (7, 4) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (9, 4) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 dangerous.  \nSo safe moves: UP, LEFT (2 safe moves).  \n\n**Enemy\u2019s possible moves this turn:**  \nFrom (5, 4):  \n- UP (5, 5) empty  \n- DOWN (5, 3) enemy body \u2192 death  \n- LEFT (4, 4) enemy body \u2192 death  \n- RIGHT (6, 4) my body \u2192 death  \nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move: UP to (5, 5).  \n\nThat means enemy will move to (5, 5) this turn.  \n\n**Long-term:**  \nI have 28 apples, need 50. Enemy has 22 apples.  \nBoth safe moves give only 2 safe options next turn.  \nFrom (8, 6), DOWN and LEFT are safe next turn. From (8, 4), UP and LEFT are safe next turn.  \n\nLEFT from (8, 6) goes to (7, 6) which is empty now and has an apple at (6, 6) nearby for future.  \nLEFT from (8, 4) goes to (7, 4) which is empty now, but (6, 4) is my body next turn (since tail moves).  \n\nActually, if I go DOWN to (8, 4), next turn LEFT to (7, 4) is safe, but then (6, 4) is my body, so future moves limited.  \n\nIf I go UP to (8, 6), next turn LEFT to (7, 6) is safe, and (6, 6) is an apple I could aim for after that.  \n\nAlso, enemy moving to (5, 5) will be closer to apples at (5, 6) and (6, 6). I want to compete for apples while avoiding head-on.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 6), I can go LEFT to (7, 6) and then possibly DOWN to (7, 5) or further LEFT to (6, 6) for apple.  \nFrom (8, 4), I can go LEFT to (7, 4) and then maybe UP to (7, 5) or DOWN to (7, 3).  \n\nBoth are similarly safe now, but UP to (8, 6) keeps me farther from enemy\u2019s new position (5, 5) and closer to apple at (6, 6) for future.  \n\n**Best choice:** UP to (8, 6) \u2014 maintain distance from enemy, aim for apple next turn.  \n\nUP",

No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? Yes (enemy segment at (8, 7)) \u2192 death. Eliminate.  \n\n2. **DOWN** to (8, 5):  \n   - On board: yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? Yes (second segment) \u2192 death. Eliminate.  \n\n3. **LEFT** to (7, 6):  \n   - On board: yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? No.  \n   - Head-on collision risk: Enemy at (5, 5) could move to (6, 5) (my body), (5, 6) (empty), (4, 5) (enemy body), (5, 4) (enemy body).  \n     Enemy\u2019s safe moves: only (5, 6).  \n     Enemy cannot reach (7, 6) in one move. Safe.  \n\n4. **RIGHT** to (9, 6):  \n   - On board: yes.  \n   - Occupied by my body? No.  \n   - Occupied by enemy body? Yes (enemy segment at (9, 6)) \u2192 death. Eliminate.  \n\nSo only safe move: LEFT to (7, 6).  \n\n**Next turn safety after LEFT:**  \nIf LEFT to (7, 6) (no apple there), tail moves to (4, 8), body length stays 28.  \nNext turn from (7, 6):  \n- UP (7, 7) \u2192 enemy body \u2192 dangerous.  \n- DOWN (7, 5) \u2192 my body (will be at (8, 5) and (7, 5) still there? Let\u2019s check: after moving, body will be [(7, 6), (8, 6), (8, 5), (7, 5), \u2026], so (7, 5) is 4th segment \u2192 occupied.  \n- LEFT (6, 6) \u2192 apple (6, 6) \u2192 empty now.  \n- RIGHT (8, 6) \u2192 empty (old head position).  \n\nSo next turn safe moves: LEFT (to 6,6 apple) and RIGHT (to 8,6).  \n\n**Enemy\u2019s possible moves this turn:**  \nFrom (5, 5):  \n- UP (5, 6) empty (apple at (5, 6)? Yes, apple at (5, 6) in list)  \n- DOWN (5, 4) enemy body \u2192 death  \n- LEFT (4, 5) enemy body \u2192 death  \n- RIGHT (6, 5) my body \u2192 death  \nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move: UP to (5, 6) and eat apple.  \n\nThat means enemy will grow to length 24, new tail extends from (9, 3) stays, head at (5, 6).  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI must survive this turn with only LEFT. Next turn from (7, 6) I can go LEFT to (6, 6) to eat apple and compete, or RIGHT to (8, 6) to stay safe but not eat.  \nGoing LEFT to (6, 6) next turn puts my head at (6, 6) with enemy at (5, 6) \u2014 adjacent horizontally, which is risky for head-on if enemy moves into me. But enemy\u2019s possible moves from (5, 6) next turn: UP (5, 7) enemy body, DOWN (5, 5) empty, LEFT (4, 6) enemy body, RIGHT (6, 6) my head if I go there. So if I go to (6, 6) next turn, enemy could move RIGHT into me and we both die. That\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nSo better plan: next turn from (7, 6) go RIGHT back to (8, 6) to avoid adjacency with enemy, then reassess.  \n\n**Strategy note for next turn:**  \nOnly safe move now is LEFT. Next turn from (7, 6), avoid (6, 6) if enemy at (5, 6) because of head-on risk. Prefer RIGHT to (8, 6) to keep distance. Look for apples at (7, 8) or (6, 0) later via safer path.  \n\nLEFT",

Eliminate.  \n\n**Wait \u2014 that leaves no safe moves if LEFT leads to head-on and others are deadly.** Let\u2019s double-check enemy\u2019s safe moves from (5, 6):  \n- UP (5, 7): enemy body (occupied) \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN (5, 5): enemy body (occupied) \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT (4, 6): enemy body (occupied) \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT (6, 6): empty (apple).  \nSo enemy\u2019s only safe move is RIGHT to (6, 6).  \n\nTherefore, if I go LEFT to (6, 6), we both go there \u2192 head-on collision.  \n\nBut maybe enemy could choose a different move if it sees head-on? No \u2014 rules say all snakes move simultaneously, and enemy\u2019s only safe move is RIGHT. So enemy must go RIGHT to (6, 6) or die. So LEFT is fatal.  \n\nThat means all four moves seem fatal:  \n- UP: into enemy body  \n- DOWN: into my body  \n- LEFT: head-on collision with enemy  \n- RIGHT: into my body  \n\nBut let\u2019s check RIGHT again: (8, 6) is my second segment now? Yes, my body list starts with (8, 6) as first segment after head. So moving RIGHT into (8, 6) is moving into my own body \u2192 death.  \n\nSo is there any escape? Let\u2019s check if enemy might die before me, making head-on not happen? No, enemy moves at same time.  \n\nWait \u2014 maybe I miscounted my body for RIGHT: My head is at (7, 6). My body segments:  \n1st after head: (8, 6)  \n2nd: (8, 5)  \n\u2026  \nSo (8, 6) is occupied by my body. Yes, so RIGHT is suicide.  \n\nThen all moves fatal? That can\u2019t be \u2014 maybe I missed that enemy might have another safe move? Let\u2019s re-check enemy\u2019s possible moves from (5, 6):  \nCoordinates:  \n- UP (5, 7): in enemy body list? Yes, (5, 7) is in enemy body (index 14 in list).  \n- DOWN (5, 5): in enemy body list? Yes, (5, 5) is first body segment.  \n- LEFT (4, 6): in enemy body list? Yes, (4, 6) is index 10 in list.  \n- RIGHT (6, 6): not in enemy body list, not in my body list (my body has (6, 5), (6, 4), etc., but not (6, 6)).  \n\nSo indeed enemy\u2019s only safe move is RIGHT to (6, 6).  \n\nThen my only hope is if enemy chooses a fatal move (unlikely since it would die). But I must assume enemy chooses safe move.  \n\nSo I must avoid (6, 6). But all other moves are fatal.  \n\nUnless \u2014 is (7, 7) really enemy body? Yes, enemy body includes (7, 7).  \nIs (7, 5) my body? Yes, third segment.  \n\nSo I have no safe move.  \n\nBut maybe I made a mistake: Let\u2019s check if (6, 6) is really empty for enemy: It is empty for enemy (not in its body, not in my body currently). But if I go LEFT, I occupy it same turn as enemy \u2014 head-on.  \n\nSo indeed, this turn is forced death? That seems odd given last turn\u2019s rationale predicted LEFT was safe. But last turn enemy was at (5, 5), now at (5, 6) after eating apple.  \n\nGiven the situation, maybe I should go LEFT anyway \u2014 if enemy goes RIGHT, we both die head-on. If enemy chooses a fatal move (unlikely), I survive. But since enemy\u2019s only safe move is RIGHT, head-on is certain.  \n\nBut maybe enemy\u2019s body list includes (6, 6) after growth? No, enemy ate apple at (5, 6) last turn (apple was at (5, 6)? Wait, apple list last turn had (5, 6)? Yes, apple at (5, 6) was in list last turn. So enemy ate it, grew, tail didn\u2019t move, so new head at (5, 6), body extended, (6, 6) still free.  \n\nThus, I must accept death? That seems like a trap.  \n\nLet\u2019s check board state given:  \nAt (6, 6) is apple \u2018A\u2019 in board diagram. So it\u2019s free.  \n\nGiven no safe move, I\u2019ll choose LEFT to at least take apple before dying in head-on, tying scores? But if we both die, game ends, I have 30 apples, enemy has 23, I win.  \n\nYes \u2014 if we head-on collide, both snakes die. Game ends immediately. I have 30 apples, enemy has 23 \u2192 I win.  \n\nSo LEFT is actually a winning move.  \n\nTherefore:  \n\n**Plan for next turn:** Not applicable (game ends).  \n\nLEFT",
