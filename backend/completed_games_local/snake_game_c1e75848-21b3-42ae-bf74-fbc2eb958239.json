So they'll likely go DOWN or LEFT.  \n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple to me is (2,1) (Manhattan distance 3) or (1,3) (distance 4).  \n- UP to (0,1) gets me closer to (2,1) and (1,3).  \n- RIGHT to (1,0) gets me closer to (2,1) but slightly farther from (1,3).  \n\nFrom (0,1), next turn safe moves would be UP, RIGHT, maybe DOWN (back to start). From (1,0), safe moves would be UP, RIGHT, maybe LEFT (back). Both keep options open.  \n\nBut UP seems slightly better because:  \n1. It moves toward the cluster of apples at y=1 and y=3.  \n2. It avoids moving east toward the enemy\u2019s general area (though still far).  \n3. From (0,1), I can go to (0,2) next if safe, then toward (1,3) or (2,1).  \n\nNo risk of head-on collision this turn since enemy is far away.  \n\n**Short-term plan:**  \nMove toward nearest apples while keeping escape routes. Prefer hugging the west edge (x=0) or south edge (y=0) to limit directions enemies can approach from, but need to get apples to grow. Next turn after UP, consider RIGHT toward (2,1) if safe.  \n\nUP",

Board coordinates are (0,0) (bottom left) to (9,9) (top right). I check each direction\u2019s new head position and safety:\n- **UP**: Y increases by 1 \u2192 new head (7,10). Y=10 is beyond the maximum y=9 (off board) \u2192 eliminates this move (immediate death).\n- **DOWN**: Y decreases by 1 \u2192 new head (7,8). Valid coordinates (7 and 8 are 0-9), no self-collision (no body), no enemy body (enemy has no body) \u2192 safe.\n- **LEFT**: X decreases by 1 \u2192 new head (6,9). Valid coordinates (6 and 9 are 0-9), no self-collision, no enemy body \u2192 safe.\n- **RIGHT**: X increases by 1 \u2192 new head (8,9). Valid coordinates (8 and 9 are 0-9), no self-collision, no enemy body \u2192 safe.\n\n### Step 2: Rank Safe Moves by Apple Proximity and Follow-Up Options\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. I evaluate each against the objective of safe apple access and open future options:\n- **DOWN (7,8)**: More follow-up safe moves (4 total: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) but moves away from the closest apple (2,9) (same y-level as current head). Lower immediate apple-eating potential.\n- **RIGHT (8,9)**: 3 follow-up safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) but moves toward the top-right edge (x=9 is max x) and away from the closest apple (2,9). Fewer immediate apple prospects.\n- **LEFT (6,9)**: 3 follow-up safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) and moves directly toward the closest apple (2,9) (same y-level, x=2 is left of x=6). This apple is the most accessible immediate target, and moving left keeps open paths to descend to other apples later. Enemy snake (0,0) is too far to pose a head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note for Future Self\n1. Continue moving left toward the (2,9) apple in subsequent turns (as long as safe) to collect your first point.\n2. After collecting (2,9), assess the next closest apple (likely (9,7) or the lower apples at (1,3)/(5,3)) while monitoring the enemy\u2019s movement (they will likely move up/right from (0,0) to find apples).\n3. Avoid moving into dead-ends (e.g., the top-right corner where UP is blocked) to preserve follow-up options.\n\nLEFT",

Key considerations (simultaneous enemy movement poses no head-on collision risk\u2014enemy\u2019s possible safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) keep them at y\u22642, far from my y=9/y=8 positions):\n- **DOWN (4,8)**: 4 safe follow-up moves but moves away from the closest y=9 apples, with no immediate apple gain \u2192 less optimal.\n- **LEFT (3,9)**: 3 safe follow-up moves, moves toward the (2,9) apple (distance 1 from new head) but not as immediate as the closest apple.\n- **RIGHT (5,9)**: 2 safe follow-up moves (DOWN, RIGHT; LEFT would hit future body segment (4,9) after eating) but moves directly onto the closest apple (5,9), letting me collect my first apple (tying enemy #1\u2019s score) \u2192 highest priority for immediate point gain.\n\n### Long-Term Strategy Note for Future Self\n1. After collecting the (5,9) apple (current move), your body will be [(4,9)]\u2014avoid moving LEFT (into your body) in the next turn.\n2. Next turn, prioritize moving left toward the (2,9) apple (distance 3 from new head (5,9)) to collect a second point.\n3. Monitor enemy snake #1\u2019s movement\u2014they will likely target nearby y=3 apples (1,3) or (5,3) as they\u2019re at y=1.\n4. Avoid moving UP from any y=9 position (still off the board) and only move DOWN if enemy blocks your path to y=9 apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Apples eaten: 1.\n- Enemy snake (ID 0): head at (4,9), no body (length 1), apples eaten: 0.\n- Apples at: (9,7), (5,3), (1,3), (2,9), (5,9).\n\n**Possible moves from (2,1):**\n- UP \u2192 (2,2) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- DOWN \u2192 (2,0) \u2014 empty, safe.\n- LEFT \u2192 (1,1) \u2014 my own body segment (tail), so would die.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (3,1) \u2014 empty, safe.\n\nSo LEFT is unsafe (self-collision). UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe from immediate self-hit and board boundaries.\n\n**Check enemy movement possibilities:**\nEnemy head at (4,9). Possible moves: UP (4,10) off-board \u2192 invalid, DOWN (4,8), LEFT (3,9), RIGHT (5,9) \u2014 but (5,9) has an apple, so possible.  \nGiven enemy has no body, they can move DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT safely unless they go off-board.\n\n**Potential head-on collision:**  \nIf I move RIGHT to (3,1), enemy is far away at (4,9), so no risk of head-on this turn.  \nIf I move UP to (2,2) or DOWN to (2,0), also safe distance-wise.\n\n**Apple proximity:**\nClosest apple to me: (1,3) is at \u0394x=-1, \u0394y=+2.  \n(5,3) is \u0394x=+3, \u0394y=+2.  \n(2,9) is \u0394y=+8 far.  \n(9,7) far.  \n(5,9) far.\n\n(1,3) is closest Manhattan distance = |2-1| + |1-3| = 1+2=3.  \nBut (1,3) is currently at y=3, x=1. My head at (2,1). To reach it I\u2019d need to go UP twice and LEFT once. But LEFT from (2,1) is unsafe now. So maybe first go UP to (2,2), then next turn consider LEFT to (1,2) if safe.\n\n**Future options:**\n- If I go UP to (2,2): next turn possible moves: UP to (2,3) closer to apple (1,3), LEFT to (1,2), RIGHT to (3,2), DOWN back to (2,1) but body at (1,1) will have moved? Wait, my body: head moves, tail follows. Current body: head (2,1), tail (1,1). If I move UP to (2,2), new head (2,2), body becomes [(2,1)] (tail at old head). So (1,1) disappears. So next turn from (2,2), my only body cell is (2,1) behind me. So LEFT to (1,2) would be safe next turn (not hitting myself unless I reverse into (2,1) which is DOWN from (1,2)? No, (1,2) to (2,1) is diagonal? Actually from (1,2), DOWN is (1,1), not (2,1). So fine.)\n\n- If I go DOWN to (2,0): next turn possible moves: LEFT (1,0), RIGHT (3,0), UP (2,1) (back into my old head position which will be empty). That\u2019s safe but moves away from apples.\n\n- If I go RIGHT to (3,1): next turn possible moves: UP (3,2), DOWN (3,0), RIGHT (4,1), LEFT (2,1) (empty then). Moves me slightly away from closest apple (1,3).\n\n**Long-term strategy note:**  \nGoal: collect apples safely, avoid dead ends. Currently enemy far away, so focus on path to nearest apple (1,3) via safe sequence: UP then possibly LEFT next turn if clear. Avoid boxing self into corners.\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP seems best: moves toward apple (1,3), keeps options open (three directions next turn), safe now.\n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Enemy snake #0 at head (5,8) with body at (5,9).\n\n**Step 1: Check immediate safety of each move from (2,3):**\n- UP to (2,4): Empty cell. Safe.\n- DOWN to (2,2): My own body cell \u2192 deadly. Eliminated.\n- LEFT to (1,3): Contains apple at (1,3). Moving onto apple is safe (eating occurs before collision checks). Safe.\n- RIGHT to (3,3): Empty cell. Safe.\n\nAll moves except DOWN are immediately safe.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions this turn:**\n\nEnemy snake #0 head at (5,8), body at (5,9). Enemy's possible moves:\n- UP to (5,9): Own body \u2192 deadly.\n- DOWN to (5,7): Empty.\n- LEFT to (4,8): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (6,8): Empty.\n\nEnemy cannot move UP. Its safe moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nMy possible moves: UP (2,4), LEFT (1,3), RIGHT (3,3).\n\nNo head-on collision possible this turn because enemy is at least 3 cells away from all my possible destinations.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate safe moves for future options and apple proximity:**\n\nClosest apples: (1,3) is adjacent LEFT, (5,3) is 3 cells away (right/down), (5,5) is 3 cells away (right/up), (2,9) is 6 cells up, (9,7) is far.\n\n- LEFT (1,3): Eats apple immediately. After eating, my length becomes 3 (head at (1,3), body at (2,3), (2,2)). Next turn from (1,3), possible moves: UP (1,4), DOWN (1,2), LEFT (0,3), RIGHT (2,3) but (2,3) will be occupied by my new body segment \u2192 deadly. So after eating, I'd have 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Eating gives me +1 apple (total 2) and extends lead over enemy (currently 1 apple). However, moving LEFT into apple might be predictable.\n\n- UP (2,4): Moves toward center, keeps distance from walls. From (2,4), next turn options: UP (2,5), DOWN (2,3) but (2,3) will be empty (my old head), LEFT (1,4), RIGHT (3,4). All four moves likely safe next turn unless enemy moves into them. This maintains maximum mobility.\n\n- RIGHT (3,3): Moves away from closest apple (1,3). From (3,3), next turn: UP (3,4), DOWN (3,2), LEFT (2,3) empty, RIGHT (4,3). Also good mobility but doesn't progress toward immediate apple.\n\n**Step 4: Strategic considerations:**\n\nEnemy is far away at (5,8). It will likely move toward apples (5,5) or (5,3) eventually. If I eat (1,3) now, I gain apple advantage. However, after eating, my next move from (1,3) has only 3 safe options (UP, DOWN, LEFT) because RIGHT is blocked by my own new body. That's still acceptable.\n\nUP from (2,3) to (2,4) leaves apple (1,3) untouched, but I could move LEFT next turn to eat it if enemy doesn't take it. Enemy cannot reach (1,3) this turn (minimum 5 moves away). So apple (1,3) will remain next turn unless another snake appears (none).\n\n**Decision:** \nLEFT to (1,3) gives immediate apple, increasing my lead to 2 apples vs enemy's 1. The slight reduction in next-turn mobility (3 safe moves instead of 4) is acceptable because I'll have more length and can plan accordingly. UP is also good but delays eating. Given the objective is to collect apples and win, taking the sure adjacent apple now is optimal.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter eating apple at (1,3), assess moves from (1,3). Likely move UP to (1,4) to avoid wall at left edge (0,3) and move toward other apples (5,5) or (2,9). Monitor enemy movement from (5,8) \u2014 it may move DOWN toward (5,7) or LEFT/RIGHT.

Monitor enemy snake #1\u2019s movement toward (1,3) or (5,3) apples; maintain upper-to-middle y distance to avoid accidental collisions as we both grow.\n4.

          "rationale": "Looking at the current board state, my snake (ID 1) is at head (1,3) with body at (2,3) and (2,2). There are apples at (9,7), (5,3), (2,9), (5,5), and (8,2). The enemy snake #0 is at head (5,7) with body at (5,8).\n\n**Step 1: Check immediate safety of each move from (1,3):**\n- UP to (1,4): Empty cell. Safe.\n- DOWN to (1,2): Empty cell. Safe.\n- LEFT to (0,3): Empty cell. Safe.\n- RIGHT to (2,3): This is my own body segment (the first segment behind my head). Moving into my own body is deadly. **Eliminated.**\n\nSo, UP, DOWN, and LEFT are immediately safe.\n\n**Step 2: Consider enemy movement and potential collisions this turn:**\nEnemy snake #0 head is at (5,7), body at (5,8). Enemy's possible moves:\n- UP to (5,8): Own body \u2192 deadly.\n- DOWN to (5,6): Empty.\n- LEFT to (4,7): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (6,7): Empty.\nEnemy cannot move UP. Its safe moves are DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nMy possible safe destinations: (1,4), (1,2), (0,3).\nAll are at least 4 cells away from the enemy's head (5,7). No head-on collision is possible this turn.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate moves for apple proximity and future options:**\nClosest apples:\n- (5,3) is 4 cells away (right 4, down 0).\n- (8,2) is 7 cells away (right 7, down 1).\n- (2,9) is 6 cells away (right 1, up 6).\n- (5,5) is 4 cells away (right 4, up 2).\n- (9,7) is far.\n\nFrom my head (1,3):\n- LEFT (0,3): Moves away from most apples, toward left wall. From (0,3), next turn options: UP (0,4), DOWN (0,2), RIGHT (1,3). RIGHT leads back to my current head's old position, which will be empty. That gives 3 safe moves, but being against the left wall reduces flexibility.\n- DOWN (1,2): Moves slightly toward apple (8,2) but still far. From (1,2), next turn: UP (1,3), DOWN (1,1), LEFT (0,2), RIGHT (2,2). RIGHT (2,2) is my own body (tail) *this turn*, but next turn my tail will move if I don't eat an apple. Since I didn't eat this turn, my tail (2,2) will move to follow. So (2,2) might be empty next turn. However, it's safer to assume my own body path is risky until confirmed. All four directions could be safe next turn if my tail moves.\n- UP (1,4): Moves toward center and closer to apples (2,9) and (5,5). From (1,4), next turn: UP (1,5), DOWN (1,3), LEFT (0,4), RIGHT (2,4). All four likely safe, good mobility.\n\n**Step 4: Strategic considerations and apple collection:**\nI have 2 apples, enemy has 1. Increasing my lead is good, but no apple is immediately adjacent. The apple at (5,3) is 4 cells away. Moving RIGHT would be best to approach it, but RIGHT is deadly into my own body. So I cannot directly move toward (5,3) this turn.\n\nUP seems best: it maintains central position and opens paths toward multiple apples (2,9) and (5,5). DOWN also keeps options open but moves away from most apples. LEFT goes to the edge.\n\nAlso, consider enemy movement: enemy at (5,7) might move DOWN toward (5,6) or toward apples (5,5) or (5,3). It is currently closer to (5,5). I should not rush into its path.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove UP to (1,4) to improve board position and head toward upper apples. Next turn, reassess. If possible, move RIGHT toward (5,3) or (5,5) while avoiding enemy. Keep monitoring enemy's head position for potential head-on collisions.\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP is the safest and offers the best future mobility and progress toward apples.\n\nUP",

Avoid moving UP until my tail (current (5,8)) is no longer part of my body (prevents self-collision).\n4.

Wait, looking at the board:  \n- Head at (1,6) marked '1'  \n- Body at (2,6) marked 'T'  \n- Next body at (2,5) marked 'T' (but board shows (2,5) as 'T' and (5,5) also 'T' - that's snake #0's body)  \nActually, checking: My snake ID 1 has body [(2,6), (2,5)] according to text. So my full snake occupies: (1,6) head, (2,6), (2,5) tail.\n\n**Enemy snake #0:** Head at (5,2), body: [(5,3), (5,4), (5,5)], length 4.\n\n**Apples:** (9,7), (2,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,5)\n\n**Possible moves from (1,6):**\n- UP \u2192 (1,7): Empty on board.\n- DOWN \u2192 (1,5): Empty on board.\n- LEFT \u2192 (0,6): Empty on board.\n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,6): Currently occupied by my own body segment. Moving RIGHT would crash into myself \u2192 **SUICIDE**.\n\nSo RIGHT is immediately eliminated.\n\n**Check other three moves for immediate death:**\n\n1. **UP to (1,7)**: Empty cell, safe from board edges (y=7 < 9). No snake bodies there. Enemy head at (5,2) far away.\n2. **DOWN to (1,5)**: Empty cell, safe (y=5 \u2265 0). No snake bodies there.\n3. **LEFT to (0,6)**: Empty cell, safe (x=0 \u2265 0). No snake bodies there.\n\nAll three seem safe from immediate collision with walls or bodies.\n\n**Consider enemy movements:** Enemy head at (5,2). Possible moves for enemy: UP to (5,3) - but that's its own body (segment at (5,3)), so suicide. DOWN to (5,1) - safe. LEFT to (4,2) - safe. RIGHT to (6,2) - safe. So enemy won't move UP into itself. It might move toward apples: closest apples to enemy are (8,2) (distance 3 horizontally), (9,5) (distance ~5), (0,0) far. Likely enemy moves RIGHT toward (8,2) or DOWN toward (0,0)? Actually (8,2) is at y=2 same row, so moving RIGHT makes sense. Or DOWN to (5,1) then LEFT toward (0,0)? But (0,0) is far. I think enemy likely moves RIGHT to (6,2) toward (8,2).\n\n**Head-on collision risk:** My possible moves vs enemy possible moves:  \nIf I go LEFT to (0,6), enemy can't reach there in one move.  \nIf I go UP to (1,7), enemy can't reach.  \nIf I go DOWN to (1,5), enemy can't reach.  \nSo no head-on collision possible this turn regardless.\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple to me is (2,9) distance: \u0394x=1, \u0394y=3 \u2192 Manhattan distance 4.  \n(9,7): \u0394x=8, \u0394y=1 \u2192 distance 9.  \n(8,2): \u0394x=7, \u0394y=-4 \u2192 distance 11.  \n(0,0): \u0394x=-1, \u0394y=-6 \u2192 distance 7.  \n(9,5): \u0394x=8, \u0394y=-1 \u2192 distance 9.\n\nSo (2,9) is closest. To reach it: need to go UP mostly. From (1,6), UP to (1,7) gets closer (distance to (2,9) becomes \u0394x=1, \u0394y=2 \u2192 3). DOWN takes me farther. LEFT takes me farther. So UP is best for apple proximity.\n\n**Future mobility:**  \nUP to (1,7): From there, possible moves next turn: UP to (1,8), DOWN to (1,6) (my old head position, now empty), LEFT to (0,7), RIGHT to (2,7). All likely safe unless enemy moves there. Good options.\n\nDOWN to (1,5): Next turn options: UP back to (1,6), DOWN to (1,4), LEFT to (0,5), RIGHT to (2,5) \u2014 but (2,5) is my tail currently, but next turn tail might move if I don't eat apple? Actually my tail is at (2,5) now, but if I move without eating, my tail moves forward? Wait rules: each turn, head moves forward, tail moves forward one cell (unless eating apple). So if I move DOWN without eating, my tail at (2,5) moves to where? The segment before tail is at (2,6) \u2192 becomes new tail? Actually my body: head\u2192(1,6), then (2,6), then (2,5) tail. When I move, new head at new position, each body segment shifts: (2,6) becomes position of old head (1,6), (2,5) becomes position of old (2,6), and tail disappears? Wait, standard snake: when not eating, head moves to new cell, each body segment moves into previous segment's position, last segment (tail) vacates its cell. So after moving DOWN to (1,5):  \nNew head: (1,5)  \nBody segment1: old head (1,6)  \nBody segment2: old (2,6)  \nTail (old (2,5)) disappears.  \nSo cell (2,5) becomes empty. So RIGHT to (2,5) next turn might be safe if no one else moves there. But anyway, DOWN gives reasonable options.\n\nLEFT to (0,6): Next turn options: UP to (0,7), DOWN to (0,5), LEFT invalid (off board), RIGHT to (1,6). Only three directions, one is off-board. Slightly more limiting.\n\n**Best move:** UP gives closest to apple (2,9), good mobility, safe.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Aim for apple at (2,9) by moving UP then RIGHT. Avoid getting trapped in left column. Keep distance from enemy snake #0 which is longer (length 4 vs my length 3). Enemy may try to cut me off. Consider circling board edges for safety.\n\n**Final move:** UP",

Key considerations (closest reachable apple is (8,2) with Manhattan distance 1 from RIGHT\u2019s new head; Enemy Snake #1\u2019s possible moves (UP, LEFT, RIGHT) do not risk head-on collision with my safe moves this turn):\n- **RIGHT (7,2)**: Moves 1 unit closer to (8,2) (Manhattan distance drops to 1) and shares the same y-coordinate as the apple, setting up a direct rightward path to eat it next turn. Follow-up safe moves from (7,2) include UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options, maximizing future flexibility).\n- **DOWN (6,1)**: Maintains 3 follow-up safe moves but increases distance to (8,2) (Manhattan distance rises to 3) \u2192 less favorable for scoring.\n- **UP (6,3)**: Only has 2 follow-up safe moves and increases distance to (8,2) (Manhattan distance rises to 3) \u2192 least favorable.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Future Self\n1.

Monitor Enemy Snake #1\u2019s movement\u2014if it shifts toward the lower right (where (8,2) is), adjust path to avoid head-on collisions or enemy body contact.\n3. Once (8,2) is safely eaten, next assess (9,5) (next closest apple) while maintaining 3+ follow-up safe moves to avoid dead-ends.\n4.

Length 3.  \nApples: (9,7), (2,9), (8,2), (0,0), (9,5).  \nEnemy snake #0: head at (6,2), body [(5,2), (5,3), (5,4)], length 4.\n\n**1. Immediate safety check (eliminate suicidal moves):**\n- UP to (1,8): Empty, within board.\n- DOWN to (1,6): Currently occupied by my own body (segment from last turn). Moving DOWN would crash into myself \u2192 **SUICIDE**.\n- LEFT to (0,7): Empty, within board.\n- RIGHT to (2,7): Empty, within board.\n\nSo DOWN is eliminated.\n\n**2. Consider enemy movements and head-on collision risk:**\nEnemy head at (6,2). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (6,3): empty.\n- DOWN to (6,1): empty.\n- LEFT to (5,2): its own body \u2192 suicide.\n- RIGHT to (7,2): empty.\n\nEnemy will likely avoid LEFT. It may move toward nearest apple (8,2) by going RIGHT, or toward (0,0) by going DOWN/LEFT? But LEFT is suicidal, so likely RIGHT or DOWN.\n\nMy possible moves vs enemy's reachable cells in one turn:\n- My UP (1,8): enemy cannot reach.\n- My LEFT (0,7): enemy cannot reach.\n- My RIGHT (2,7): enemy cannot reach.\n\nNo head-on collision possible this turn regardless of enemy's choice.\n\n**3. Apple proximity and pathing:**\nClosest apple to me is (2,9) at distance \u0394x=1, \u0394y=2 \u2192 Manhattan distance 3.  \nTo reach it: need to go UP and then RIGHT. From (1,7):\n- UP to (1,8): distance to (2,9) becomes \u0394x=1, \u0394y=1 \u2192 distance 2.\n- LEFT to (0,7): distance becomes \u0394x=2, \u0394y=2 \u2192 distance 4.\n- RIGHT to (2,7): distance becomes \u0394x=0, \u0394y=2 \u2192 distance 2.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT put me equally close (distance 2). However, RIGHT moves me directly under the apple (same x=2), setting up a vertical move next turn. UP moves me closer in y but still offset in x.\n\n**4. Future mobility assessment:**\n- UP to (1,8): Next turn options: UP to (1,9) (top edge), DOWN to (1,7) (old head, now empty), LEFT to (0,8), RIGHT to (2,8). All safe unless occupied. Good.\n- RIGHT to (2,7): Next turn options: UP to (2,8), DOWN to (2,6) (currently my body segment, but tail will move? Let's check: my tail is at (2,6). If I move without eating, tail moves forward? Actually, after my move, my body shifts: new head at (2,7), old head (1,7) becomes body segment1, old (1,6) becomes body segment2, old tail (2,6) disappears. So (2,6) becomes empty next turn. So DOWN to (2,6) would be safe next turn. Other options: LEFT to (1,7) (old head, now body), RIGHT to (3,7). So three safe directions likely.\n- LEFT to (0,7): Next turn options: UP to (0,8), DOWN to (0,6), RIGHT to (1,7) (body). LEFT is off-board. Only two safe directions, more restrictive.\n\nLEFT is less flexible.\n\n**5. Long-term positioning and enemy threat:**\nEnemy is longer (length 4 vs my 3) and currently far away (bottom right). Moving toward (2,9) keeps me in upper left, away from enemy. However, apple (9,5) and (9,7) are near enemy's side. Enemy may go for those, giving me time to collect apples on my side.\n\n**6. Decision:**\nUP and RIGHT both good. UP keeps me closer to board center vertically, RIGHT aligns me under apple (2,9). Considering future flexibility, UP gives four options next turn, RIGHT gives three (since LEFT would be into my old head position, which becomes body). However, after moving RIGHT, my old head (1,7) becomes a body segment, so moving LEFT to (1,7) next turn would be suicidal. That reduces safe directions to two (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Actually, checking: from (2,7) next turn, LEFT to (1,7) is occupied by my body, so not safe. So RIGHT move leaves UP, DOWN, RIGHT as possible. That's still three.\n\nGiven my last move was UP, continuing UP feels natural and maintains momentum toward (2,9). Also, moving UP avoids potentially boxing myself into the right column later.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nCurrent target: apple at (2,9). From (1,8) next turn, consider moving RIGHT to (2,8) then UP to (2,9). Stay aware of enemy movement; it may head toward (8,2) or (9,5). Avoid moving into lower right until necessary. Keep distance from enemy's longer body.\n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Its possible moves:  \n- UP to (7,3): empty.  \n- DOWN to (7,1): empty.  \n- LEFT to (6,2): its own body \u2192 suicide.  \n- RIGHT to (8,2): apple at (8,2) \u2192 likely attractive.  \nEnemy will likely go RIGHT toward apple (8,2) or DOWN toward (0,0)? RIGHT is safe and gets apple. My possible moves (UP/LEFT/RIGHT) are far from enemy\u2019s reachable cells this turn, so no head-on collision risk.\n\n**3.

Both are one move away next turn.\n\n**4. Future mobility:**  \n- UP to (1,9): Next turn options: DOWN to (1,8) (old head, becomes body), LEFT to (0,9), RIGHT to (2,9) \u2192 apple cell. UP is off-board. So two safe directions (LEFT, RIGHT) plus DOWN into body? Wait, after moving UP, my body becomes [(1,8), (1,7), (1,6)]? Actually, tail was at (1,6), so after moving without eating, tail moves forward: new head at (1,9), old head (1,8) becomes segment1, old (1,7) becomes segment2, old tail (1,6) disappears. So (1,8) is now body, DOWN to (1,8) would be suicidal. So only LEFT and RIGHT are safe next turn if I move UP. That\u2019s restrictive.  \n- RIGHT to (2,8): Next turn options: UP to (2,9) \u2192 apple, DOWN to (2,7) empty, LEFT to (1,8) body (suicide), RIGHT to (3,8) empty. So three safe directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Better flexibility.  \n- LEFT to (0,8): Next turn options: UP to (0,9) empty, DOWN to (0,7) empty, RIGHT to (1,8) body (suicide), LEFT off-board. So two safe directions (UP, DOWN). Less flexible.\n\n**5. Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is far away and likely heading toward (8,2) or (9,5). I should secure nearby apple (2,9) quickly while maintaining maneuverability. Moving RIGHT to (2,8) sets up a direct UP to apple next turn, and leaves me with good options afterward (DOWN or RIGHT). Moving UP to (1,9) forces me to go RIGHT next turn to get apple, but then my only safe exit might be LEFT (back to (1,9)?), which could trap me along top edge.  \n\n**6. Decision:**  \nRIGHT gives better flexibility and still puts me one step from apple (2,9). It avoids top-edge restriction. Enemy is distant, so no immediate threat.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2,8), if apple still at (2,9), move UP to eat it. If enemy moves toward my area, be ready to evade toward center or left side.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nRIGHT",

          "rationale": "Looking at the current board state and considering the rules, here\u2019s my analysis:\n\n**Current situation:**  \nMy head is at (2,8). My body: [(1,8), (1,7)]. Length 3.  \nApples: (9,7), (2,9), (0,0), (9,5), (8,7).  \nEnemy snake #0: head at (8,2), body [(7,2), (6,2), (5,2), (5,3)], length 5 (since it has 4 apples, starting length 1 + 4 = 5).  \nEnemy is far away in the bottom-right area.\n\n**1. Immediate safety check for each move from (2,8):**  \n- UP to (2,9): Within board (0\u20139). Currently empty (no body, no enemy head). Apple at (2,9) \u2192 would eat it.  \n- DOWN to (2,7): Within board. Currently empty.  \n- LEFT to (1,8): Occupied by my own body (first segment after head) \u2192 **SUICIDE**. Eliminate.  \n- RIGHT to (3,8): Within board. Currently empty.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n**2. Enemy collision risk this turn:**  \nEnemy head at (8,2). Its possible moves: UP (8,3), DOWN (8,1), LEFT (7,2) its own body (suicide), RIGHT (9,2) empty.  \nEnemy will likely avoid LEFT (suicide). It might move UP/DOWN/RIGHT. No overlap with my possible destinations (2,9), (2,7), (3,8). No head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**3. Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples:  \n- (2,9) distance \u0394x=0, \u0394y=1 \u2192 Manhattan distance 1 (directly above). UP eats it immediately.  \n- (0,0) distance \u0394x=2, \u0394y=8 \u2192 far.  \n- (9,7), (9,5), (8,7) are far.  \nUP gives instant apple (+1 point, growth by 1 segment). Eating is good, but need to consider aftermath.\n\n**4. Future mobility after each safe move:**  \n- **UP to (2,9) and eat apple**: New length becomes 4. Body becomes: new head (2,9), old head (2,8) becomes segment1, (1,8) segment2, (1,7) segment3, tail stays at (1,7) because eating means tail doesn\u2019t move? Actually, growth: when you eat, you grow by 1 segment at the end of the turn, so tail remains in place. So body: [(2,8), (1,8), (1,7)] plus new segment added at tail? Wait, typical snake mechanics: after eating, the tail doesn\u2019t move that turn, so length increases by 1. Next turn, tail will stay, so board will have extra segment. For mobility next turn from (2,9): Possible moves: DOWN to (2,8) \u2192 occupied by my body (segment1) \u2192 suicide. LEFT to (1,9) empty. RIGHT to (3,9) empty. UP off-board. So only LEFT and RIGHT are safe. That\u2019s restrictive (2 options). Being at top edge with body below reduces escape routes.  \n- **DOWN to (2,7)**: No apple. Body: new head (2,7), old head (2,8) becomes segment1, (1,8) segment2, tail (1,7) disappears (since no growth). Next turn from (2,7): UP to (2,8) body (suicide), DOWN to (2,6) empty, LEFT to (1,7) empty (currently my tail, but tail will move away), RIGHT to (3,7) empty. So safe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options). Good flexibility.  \n- **RIGHT to (3,8)**: No apple. Body: new head (3,8), old head (2,8) segment1, (1,8) segment2, tail (1,7) disappears. Next turn from (3,8): UP to (3,9) empty, DOWN to (3,7) empty, LEFT to (2,8) body (suicide), RIGHT to (4,8) empty. Safe: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options). Good flexibility.\n\n**5. Long-term considerations:**  \nEating apple (2,9) now gives me a point (3 apples total vs enemy\u2019s 4). But it traps me along top edge with only two safe moves next turn, which could be risky if enemy approaches later. However, enemy is far away (distance ~6 in x, 6 in y). I could eat apple and then work my way left along top row to open space.  \nAlternatively, delaying eating to maintain mobility might be smarter. But apples don\u2019t disappear unless eaten, so (2,9) will remain. I could move DOWN or RIGHT to improve position, then approach apple later from a safer angle.\n\n**6. Risk of enemy intercepting apple?**  \nEnemy is at (8,2), far from (2,9). Unlikely to reach it soon. No urgency.\n\n**7. Decision:**  \nUP gives immediate apple but reduces next-turn options to 2.  \nDOWN and RIGHT give 3 options each and keep me safe.  \nSince survival is paramount and enemy is distant, I prefer keeping flexibility. Between DOWN and RIGHT:  \n- DOWN moves me toward center, opens more space.  \n- RIGHT moves me toward right side where enemy is, but still far.  \nApple (2,9) is still reachable later from (2,7) or (3,8). From (2,7), UP to (2,8) then UP to (2,9) is two moves, but (2,8) will be body after next turn? Actually if I move DOWN to (2,7), next turn my body will be [(2,8), (1,8), (1,7)]? Wait, tail disappears: body segments: head at (2,7), then (2,8), then (1,8), tail at (1,7) gone. So (2,8) is body, so UP from (2,7) to (2,8) would be suicide. So from (2,7), I cannot go UP next turn. That means I\u2019d need to go LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN first, then approach apple later. That\u2019s less direct.  \nFrom (3,8), next turn I can go UP to (3,9) then LEFT to (2,9) to eat apple in two turns, but that\u2019s also indirect.  \nSo perhaps eating now is better to secure the apple and gain length advantage.\n\nBut let\u2019s check: If I go UP and eat, my length becomes 4. Next turn my only safe moves are LEFT to (1,9) or RIGHT to (3,9). From (1,9), options: DOWN to (1,8) body? Wait, after moving UP to (2,9) and eating, body: head (2,9), segment1 (2,8), segment2 (1,8), segment3 (1,7). So (1,8) is body, so from (1,9) DOWN to (1,8) suicide. LEFT off-board, RIGHT to (2,9) body, UP off-board. So from (1,9) only DOWN? Actually DOWN is suicide. So only move from (1,9) would be? None? That\u2019s a dead end. Similarly from (3,9): DOWN to (3,8) body? (3,8) would be empty? Let\u2019s track: If I go UP to (2,9) and eat, next turn if I go RIGHT to (3,9), my body becomes: head (3,9), segment1 (2,9), segment2 (2,8), segment3 (1,8), tail (1,7). So (2,9) is body, (2,8) body, (1,8) body. From (3,9), possible moves: DOWN to (3,8) empty? Actually (3,8) is empty because old head was at (2,8), not (3,8). So DOWN is safe. LEFT to (2,9) body suicide, RIGHT off-board, UP off-board. So from (3,9) only DOWN is safe. So after eating apple and moving RIGHT next turn, I\u2019d have only one safe move (DOWN). That\u2019s risky.  \nTherefore, eating apple now may lead to being trapped.\n\nBetter to avoid UP and choose DOWN or RIGHT to maintain more options.\n\nBetween DOWN and RIGHT:  \nDOWN moves me toward center and away from top edge. RIGHT moves me toward right side where enemy is but also toward apples (9,7), (9,5), (8,7) in long term. Enemy is at (8,2), so still far.  \nI think DOWN is safer because it opens more central space.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove DOWN to (2,7). Next turn, from (2,7), safe moves: DOWN to (2,6), LEFT to (1,7), RIGHT to (3,7). I\u2019ll assess then. Apple (2,9) can be targeted later by moving right then up, etc.\n\n**Final move:**  \nDOWN",

Moving backwards into your own body kills you. **Not safe**.\n3. **LEFT** to (1,9): Empty cell. Check: Not my body, not enemy body. **Safe**.\n4. **RIGHT** to (3,9): Empty cell. Check: Not my body, not enemy body. **Safe**.\n\nSo safe moves are LEFT and RIGHT.\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \n- Nearest apple to (2,9): (4,5) is 5 cells away (Manhattan distance). (0,0) is far. (9,7) is 7 cells away. (8,7) is 6 cells away. (8,0) is far.\n- Moving LEFT to (1,9) gets me slightly closer to (0,0) but that's a long-term target. Moving RIGHT to (3,9) gets me slightly closer to (4,5) and (8,7).\n\n**Enemy threat:** Enemy head at (9,6). It could move UP to (9,7) (apple), DOWN to (9,5), LEFT to (8,6), or RIGHT (off board). It's far from me, so no immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Future mobility:**  \n- From (1,9): Next moves could be DOWN (to (1,8) \u2013 my body, unsafe), LEFT (to (0,9) \u2013 safe), RIGHT (to (2,9) \u2013 my current head, safe), UP (off board). So only LEFT and RIGHT would be safe next turn, which is limited.\n- From (3,9): Next moves could be DOWN (to (3,8) \u2013 empty), LEFT (to (2,9) \u2013 my old head, safe), RIGHT (to (4,9) \u2013 empty), UP (off board). That gives three safe options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Better flexibility.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nRIGHT seems better for maintaining options and moving toward the cluster of apples at (4,5) and (8,7). I should avoid going left into the corner where I might get trapped. Also, moving RIGHT keeps distance from enemy snake currently in lower right.\n\n**Next turn plan:** After moving RIGHT to (3,9), I'll assess targeting (4,5) by moving DOWN/LEFT when safe, while watching enemy movements.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy Snake #1 remains head-to-tail [(3,9), (2,9), (2,8), (1,8)]. I assess each direction\u2019s new head position for death triggers (off-board, self-collision, enemy body collision, backwards move):\n- **UP**: New head (9,8) \u2192 valid coordinates, no overlap with own/enemy body, not a backwards move \u2192 safe.\n- **DOWN**: New head (9,6) \u2192 matches my first body segment (direct backwards move + self-collision) \u2192 eliminated.\n- **LEFT**: New head (8,7) \u2192 valid coordinates, no overlap with own/enemy body, not a backwards move \u2192 safe (and (8,7) is an apple for immediate gain).\n- **RIGHT**: New head (10,7) \u2192 x=10 exceeds max x=9 (off-board) \u2192 eliminated.\n\n### Step 2: Rank Safe Moves by Follow-Up Options, Apple Proximity, and Head-On Collision Risk\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT. Key assessments (Enemy Snake #1\u2019s only safe moves are DOWN (3,8) and RIGHT (4,9), which pose no head-on collision risk with my safe new heads):\n- **LEFT (8,7)**: Immediate apple gain (increases my count to 7, widening lead over Snake #1\u2019s 3). Post-move body (no tail pop) is [(8,7), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3), (8,2)], offering 3 follow-up safe moves (UP to (8,8), DOWN to (8,6), LEFT to (7,7)) for strong mobility.\n- **UP (9,8)**: No immediate apple gain. Post-move body (tail pop) is [(9,8), (9,7), (9,6), (9,5), (8,5), (8,4), (8,3)], offering only 2 follow-up safe moves (UP to (9,9), LEFT to (8,8)) and limited near-term apple access.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Future Self (Next 3 Turns)\n1. After moving LEFT to collect (8,7), next turn prioritize checking if moving UP to (8,8) is safe (confirm no self/enemy collision) to maintain upper mobility.\n2. Post-collecting (8,7), evaluate if moving LEFT to (7,7) is safe to avoid the x=9 right-edge trap; monitor Snake #1\u2019s movement (it\u2019s still in the upper-left, unlikely to interfere with upper-right apples for now).\n3. Once upper-right apples are cleared, start assessing paths to (4,5) or (5,3) apples, avoiding the lower-left (0,0) and (8,0) apples until mobility is secured (those edge positions risk trapping).\n\nLEFT",

Check: Not my body, not enemy body. **Safe**.\n3. **LEFT** to (2,9): That's my own body segment (directly behind my head). Moving backwards into your own body kills you. **Not safe**.\n4. **RIGHT** to (4,9): Empty cell. Check: Not my body, not enemy body. **Safe**.\n\nSo safe moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n**Apple targeting & enemy considerations:**  \nThe apple at (4,5) is closest (Manhattan distance 4 from both (3,8) and (4,9)). The enemy snake (head at (9,7)) will likely eat the apple at (8,7) this turn if it moves LEFT. After eating, its body will extend, blocking that area. My priority should be securing the central apple (4,5) while avoiding potential future collisions.\n\n**Future mobility from each safe move:**  \n- **DOWN to (3,8)**: Next turn, I can move DOWN (to (3,7)), RIGHT (to (4,8)), or LEFT (to (2,8) \u2013 but that's currently my body; however, after moving, my tail may shift if no apple eaten, so (2,8) could become safe). This opens a path toward (4,5) via successive DOWN moves.\n- **RIGHT to (4,9)**: Next turn, I can move DOWN (to (4,8)) or RIGHT (to (5,9)), but LEFT (to (3,9)) will be my body. This also allows a path to (4,5) via DOWN moves.\n\nBoth moves offer similar access to (4,5), but DOWN gets me closer vertically and away from the top edge, reducing risk. Moving RIGHT keeps me near the top where UP is permanently blocked.\n\n**Enemy threat assessment:**  \nThe enemy is distant and focused on the (8,7) apple. No immediate head-on collision risk. I should continue toward the central apples while monitoring the enemy's growth.\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nMove DOWN to position myself for the apple at (4,5). Next turn, evaluate moving DOWN again if safe, or RIGHT if needed to avoid my own body. Keep an eye on the enemy's trajectory after it eats (8,7) \u2013 it may move toward (5,3) or (4,5) later.\n\nDOWN",

Apples at (0,0), (4,5), (8,0), (5,3), (7,8).\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Immediate safety check for each direction:**\n\n- **UP** to (3,9): That's my own body segment directly behind my head (the neck). Moving backwards into your own body kills you. **NOT SAFE.**\n- **DOWN** to (3,8): Currently empty cell (my head is at (3,8) now, but after moving DOWN from (3,9) my head would go to (3,8)). Wait, careful: My head is at (3,8)? No, the board shows \"1\" at (3,8). Let's check: \"Your snake (ID: 1): Head: (3, 8)\". So my head is at (3,8). Body: [(3,9), (2,9), (2,8)]. That means my neck is at (3,9). So moving UP would go to (3,9) \u2013 my neck \u2013 unsafe. Moving DOWN would go to (3,7)? Let's calculate: Coordinates: (3,8) moving DOWN decreases y by 1 \u2192 (3,7). Check board: (3,7) is empty (dot). Not my body (my body at (3,9), (2,9), (2,8)). Not enemy body (enemy body listed). So **DOWN to (3,7) is SAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (2,8): That's my own tail segment (last body part). Moving into your own body kills you. **NOT SAFE.**\n- **RIGHT** to (4,8): Empty cell (dot). Not my body, not enemy body. **SAFE.**\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy simultaneous movement and head-on collision risk:**\n\nEnemy head at (8,7). Possible enemy moves:\n- UP to (8,8): That's apple at (7,8)? Wait apple at (7,8) is at y=8, x=7. So (8,8) is empty.\n- DOWN to (8,6): empty.\n- LEFT to (7,7): empty.\n- RIGHT to (9,7): That's its own body (neck) \u2013 unsafe.\n\nEnemy likely wants apple at (7,8) \u2013 could move UP to (8,8) then next turn LEFT to (7,8). Or could move LEFT directly to (7,7) then UP to (7,8). No immediate head-on collision with me at (3,7) or (4,8). So both moves safe from enemy head collision this turn.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting and future mobility:**\n\nApples: (4,5) is closest to me (Manhattan distance from (3,8) = |3-4|+|8-5| = 1+3=4). From (3,7) distance to (4,5) = 1+2=3. From (4,8) distance to (4,5) = 0+3=3. Both equally close in steps.\n\nBut consider future moves: From (3,7) next turn I can go DOWN to (3,6), LEFT to (2,7), RIGHT to (4,7). From (4,8) next turn I can go DOWN to (4,7), LEFT to (3,8) \u2013 but (3,8) will be my old head position? Actually after I move, my body shifts: if I don't eat apple, my tail (2,8) disappears, so (3,8) might become empty? Let's simulate: If I move RIGHT to (4,8), my new head at (4,8), my body becomes: new head at (4,8), then old head (3,8) becomes neck, then (3,9) becomes second segment, then (2,9) becomes tail. So (3,8) is occupied by my neck next turn. So LEFT from (4,8) would be into my own neck \u2013 unsafe next turn. So from (4,8) only DOWN and RIGHT might be safe next turn, possibly also UP? UP to (4,9) \u2013 currently empty but after my move, (3,9) is my body, (4,9) is empty. But UP from (4,8) goes to (4,9) \u2013 that could be safe if no enemy moves there.\n\nFrom (3,7), next turn DOWN to (3,6) safe, LEFT to (2,7) safe, RIGHT to (4,7) safe. So DOWN now gives more options next turn.\n\nAlso, apple at (4,5) is closer vertically from (3,7) than from (4,8) because I can go DOWN twice then RIGHT? Actually from (3,7): DOWN to (3,6), DOWN to (3,5), RIGHT to (4,5) \u2013 3 moves. From (4,8): DOWN to (4,7), DOWN to (4,6), DOWN to (4,5) \u2013 also 3 moves. Same.\n\nBut enemy is at (8,7) with 7 apples, I have 3 apples. He's closer to apple at (7,8) and (5,3) and (8,0). He might go for (7,8) first. I should target (4,5) which is farther from him.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn:**\n\nPlan: Secure apple at (4,5). Move DOWN now to (3,7) to open more future directions. Next turn, assess safety: likely move DOWN again to (3,6) if safe, or RIGHT to (4,7) if DOWN blocked. Avoid moving toward enemy until necessary. Monitor enemy's growth after it likely eats (7,8) apple.\n\n**Final choice:** DOWN maximizes future mobility and moves toward apple while being safe.\n\nDOWN",

I assess each direction\u2019s new head position for death triggers:\n- **UP**: New head (8,9) \u2192 valid coordinates (0-9,0-9), no overlap with own/enemy body (Enemy Snake #1\u2019s body: [(3,8), (3,9), (2,9)]), not a backwards move (backwards = (8,7)) \u2192 safe.\n- **DOWN**: New head (8,7) \u2192 matches my first body segment \u2192 self-collision \u2192 eliminated.\n- **LEFT**: New head (7,8) \u2192 valid coordinates, no overlap with own/enemy body, not a backwards move \u2192 safe (and this is the (7,8) apple!).\n- **RIGHT**: New head (9,8) \u2192 valid coordinates, no overlap with own/enemy body, not a backwards move \u2192 safe.\n\n### Step 2: Rank Safe Moves by Follow-Up Options, Apple Proximity, and Head-On Collision Risk\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT. Key assessments (Enemy Snake #1\u2019s safe moves: DOWN (3,6), LEFT (2,7), RIGHT (4,7) \u2014 no overlap with my safe new heads, so no head-on collision risk):\n- **LEFT (7,8)**: Immediate apple collection (widens score gap over Enemy #1), post-move body (no tail pop due to apple) offers 3 follow-up safe moves (UP to (7,9), DOWN to (7,7), LEFT to (6,8)) \u2192 strong upper-right mobility, high priority.\n- **UP (8,9)**: No immediate apple gain, post-move body (tail pop of (8,3)) offers only 2 follow-up safe moves (LEFT to (7,9), RIGHT to (9,9)) \u2192 limited mobility, lower priority.\n- **RIGHT (9,8)**: No immediate apple gain, post-move body (tail pop of (8,3)) offers only 1 follow-up safe move (UP to (9,9)) \u2192 high trap risk, lowest priority.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Future Self (Next 3 Turns)\n1. After collecting the (7,8) apple, next turn prioritize checking if moving UP to (7,9) or DOWN to (7,7) is safe (confirm no self/enemy collision \u2014 Enemy #1 is unlikely to reach the upper-right quickly).\n2. Post-collecting (7,8), evaluate paths to the central apples (4,5) or (5,3) to maintain score growth; avoid the lower-edge apples (0,0) and (8,0) for now (potential traps with x=0/9 edges).\n3. Monitor Snake #1\u2019s movement \u2014 if it shifts toward central apples, adjust path to block or avoid its body to prevent trap risks.\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "**Analysis of current board state:**\n\nMy snake (ID 1) head at (3,7), body: [(3,8), (3,9), (2,9)]. Enemy snake #0 head at (8,8), body long. Apples at (0,0), (4,5), (8,0), (5,3), (7,8).\n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Immediate safety check for each direction:**\n\n- **UP** to (3,8): That's my own body segment directly behind my head (the neck). Moving backwards into your own body kills you. **NOT SAFE.**\n- **DOWN** to (3,6): Within board (y=6 \u22650). Currently empty cell (dot). Not my body (my body at (3,8), (3,9), (2,9)). Not enemy body (enemy body listed). So **DOWN to (3,6) is SAFE**.\n- **LEFT** to (2,7): Within board (x=2 \u22650). Empty cell (dot). Not my body, not enemy body. **SAFE.**\n- **RIGHT** to (4,7): Within board (x=4 \u22649). Empty cell (dot). Not my body, not enemy body. **SAFE.**\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Consider enemy simultaneous movement and head-on collision risk:**\n\nEnemy head at (8,8). Possible enemy moves:\n- UP to (8,9): Empty cell (dot).\n- DOWN to (8,7): That's its own body segment (neck) \u2013 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (7,8): That's an apple (A) at (7,8). Likely attractive.\n- RIGHT to (9,8): Empty cell (dot).\n\nEnemy likely wants apple at (7,8) \u2013 could move LEFT directly. No immediate head-on collision with me at (3,6), (2,7), or (4,7) because we are far apart. So all three moves safe from enemy head collision this turn.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting and future mobility:**\n\nApples: (4,5) is closest to me (Manhattan distance from (3,7) = |3-4|+|7-5| = 1+2=3). From (3,6) distance to (4,5) = 1+1=2. From (2,7) distance to (4,5) = 2+2=4. From (4,7) distance to (4,5) = 0+2=2. So DOWN and RIGHT both bring me equally closer (2 steps) to the nearest apple.\n\nConsider future mobility after each move:\n- **DOWN to (3,6)**: Next turn, possible moves: UP (back to (3,7) \u2013 will be empty? After I move, my body shifts: new head at (3,6), neck at (3,7), then (3,8), tail at (3,9). So (3,7) will be my neck \u2013 unsafe to move back there next turn). DOWN to (3,5) \u2013 empty. LEFT to (2,6) \u2013 empty. RIGHT to (4,6) \u2013 empty. So 3 safe options likely (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n- **LEFT to (2,7)**: Next turn, possible moves: UP to (2,8) \u2013 currently empty, but after my move, my tail at (2,9) remains, (2,8) empty. DOWN to (2,6) \u2013 empty. LEFT to (1,7) \u2013 empty. RIGHT to (3,7) \u2013 will be my neck (unsafe). So 3 safe options likely (UP, DOWN, LEFT).\n- **RIGHT to (4,7)**: Next turn, possible moves: UP to (4,8) \u2013 empty. DOWN to (4,6) \u2013 empty. LEFT to (3,7) \u2013 will be my neck (unsafe). RIGHT to (5,7) \u2013 empty. So 3 safe options likely (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).\n\nAll three moves offer good future mobility. However, apple at (4,5) is directly below (4,7) and (3,6). Moving DOWN to (3,6) sets me up to go RIGHT then DOWN to (4,5), or DOWN then RIGHT. Moving RIGHT to (4,7) sets me up to go DOWN twice to (4,5). Both are good.\n\nBut note enemy at (8,8) with 7 apples vs my 3 apples. Enemy is closer to apples at (7,8), (5,3), (8,0). I should focus on (4,5) and possibly (0,0) later. Moving DOWN keeps me centrally positioned and away from the enemy's likely path toward (7,8).\n\nAlso, moving LEFT to (2,7) takes me slightly away from the cluster of apples (4,5), (5,3) and toward the edge. While not bad, it might reduce future options.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long-term plan note for next turn:**\n\nPlan: Secure apple at (4,5). Move DOWN now to (3,6) to maintain central position and move toward apple. Next turn, assess safety: likely move RIGHT to (4,6) if safe, then DOWN to (4,5) the following turn. Alternatively, move DOWN again to (3,5) if RIGHT is risky. Monitor enemy movement: if enemy eats apple at (7,8), it will grow longer, potentially blocking areas. Avoid moving toward enemy head until necessary.\n\n**Final choice:** DOWN maintains proximity to nearest apple, offers good future mobility, and is safe.\n\nDOWN",

Evaluate each direction\u2019s new head position:\n- **UP (7,9)**: Valid coordinates (0-9 for x/y), no overlap with own/enemy (Snake #1) body, not a backwards move (backwards = (8,8)) \u2192 Safe.\n- **DOWN (7,7)**: Valid coordinates, no overlap with own/enemy body, not a backwards move \u2192 Safe.\n- **LEFT (6,8)**: Valid coordinates, no overlap with own/enemy body, not a backwards move \u2192 Safe.\n- **RIGHT (8,8)**: Overlaps with first body segment \u2192 Self-collision \u2192 Eliminated.\n\nEliminated move: RIGHT.

          "rationale": "Looking at the board and the situation:\n\n**Immediate safety check:**\n- My head at (3,6). Body: [(3,7), (3,8), (3,9)] (tail at (3,9)).\n- UP to (3,7): That's my own body segment (the neck) \u2013 moving backwards into your own body kills you. **NOT SAFE.**\n- DOWN to (3,5): Within board (y=5 \u22650). Currently empty cell (dot). Not my body, not enemy body. **SAFE.**\n- LEFT to (2,6): Within board (x=2 \u22650). Empty cell (dot). **SAFE.**\n- RIGHT to (4,6): Within board (x=4 \u22649). Empty cell (dot). **SAFE.**\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Enemy movement and head-on collision risk:**\nEnemy head at (7,8). Possible enemy moves:\n- UP to (7,9): Empty.\n- DOWN to (7,7): Empty.\n- LEFT to (6,8): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (8,8): That's its own body segment (neck) \u2013 unsafe.\n\nEnemy has three safe moves. The apple at (7,8) is already under its head, so eating it is automatic if it stays still? Wait \u2013 the apple is at (7,8) and enemy head is at (7,8)? Looking at the board: at (7,8) there is an 'A'? Actually the board shows at row 8, column 7: there's an 'A'? Let's check: Row 8 (y=8): \". . . T . . . 0 T .\" \u2013 at x=7,y=8 is '0' (enemy head). So apple at (7,8) is not present? The listed apples are (0,0), (4,5), (8,0), (5,3), (5,9). Wait, (5,9) is at top row? Board shows at (5,9) 'A'? Row 9: \". . . T . A . . . .\" \u2013 yes, (5,9) is apple. So (7,8) is enemy head, not apple. I misread earlier. So enemy might move toward apple at (5,9) (UP/LEFT?) or (8,0) (far). But enemy is far from me, so head-on collision unlikely this turn.\n\n**Apple targeting:**\nApples: (4,5) is closest (Manhattan distance from (3,6)=|3-4|+|6-5|=1+1=2). From possible moves:\n- DOWN to (3,5): distance to (4,5)=1+0=1.\n- LEFT to (2,6): distance=2+1=3.\n- RIGHT to (4,6): distance=0+1=1.\nSo DOWN and RIGHT both bring me equally close (distance 1) to apple (4,5). LEFT takes me farther.\n\n**Future mobility after each move:**\n- DOWN to (3,5): Next turn, my body will be: head (3,5), neck (3,6), then (3,7),(3,8), tail (3,9). Possible moves from (3,5): UP (back to neck \u2013 unsafe), DOWN to (3,4) \u2013 empty, LEFT to (2,5) \u2013 empty, RIGHT to (4,5) \u2013 apple. So 2 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT) plus RIGHT into apple (safe if apple still there).\n- RIGHT to (4,6): Next turn, body: head (4,6), neck (3,6), (3,7),(3,8),(3,9). Possible moves: UP to (4,7) \u2013 empty, DOWN to (4,5) \u2013 apple, LEFT to (3,6) \u2013 neck (unsafe), RIGHT to (5,6) \u2013 empty. So 2 safe moves (UP, RIGHT) plus DOWN into apple.\n- LEFT to (2,6): Next turn, body: head (2,6), neck (3,6), (3,7),(3,8),(3,9). Possible moves: UP to (2,7) \u2013 empty, DOWN to (2,5) \u2013 empty, LEFT to (1,6) \u2013 empty, RIGHT to (3,6) \u2013 neck (unsafe). So 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT).\n\nLEFT gives more safe options next turn, but takes me away from the nearest apple. DOWN or RIGHT lead to apple in one more move.\n\n**Strategic consideration:** Enemy has 8 apples vs my 3. I need to catch up. Apple at (4,5) is ripe for taking. Moving DOWN to (3,5) sets me to move RIGHT to (4,5) next turn to eat it. However, moving RIGHT to (4,6) also sets me to move DOWN to (4,5) next turn. Both are equivalent in steps. But moving DOWN now puts me at (3,5) which is closer to board edge (y=5, still okay). Moving RIGHT puts me at (4,6) more central.\n\nAlso note apple at (5,3) and (5,9) are nearby. After eating (4,5), I could target (5,3) or (5,9). Enemy might go for (5,9) from (7,8) \u2013 distance 3. I'm closer to (4,5).\n\n**Long-term plan for next turn:** If I move DOWN now to (3,5), next turn I can move RIGHT to (4,5) to eat apple, provided enemy doesn't take it first. Enemy could potentially move toward (4,5) but it's far (distance 4 from (7,8)). Likely safe.\n\nGiven enemy's longer body, it might be more constrained. I should secure the apple quickly.\n\n**Choice:** DOWN gets me closer to apple (4,5) and sets up direct eat next turn. It's safe and efficient.\n\nDOWN",

Body: [(3,6), (3,7), (3,8)] (tail at (3,9)).\n- UP to (3,6): That's my own body segment (the neck) \u2013 moving backwards into your own body kills you. **NOT SAFE.**\n- DOWN to (3,4): Within board (y=4 \u22650). Empty cell (dot). **SAFE.**\n- LEFT to (2,5): Within board (x=2 \u22650). Empty cell (dot). **SAFE.**\n- RIGHT to (4,5): Within board (x=4 \u22649). Apple cell (A). **SAFE** (eating apple is safe).\n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n**Apple targeting:**\nApples: (4,5) is right next to me at distance 1. (5,3) is at distance |3-5|+|5-3|=2+2=4. (5,9) is at distance |3-5|+|5-9|=2+4=6. (0,0) and (8,0) are far.\nMoving RIGHT to (4,5) eats the apple immediately.\nMoving DOWN to (3,4) or LEFT to (2,5) moves me away from the nearest apple.\n\n**Enemy movement and collision risk:**\nEnemy head at (6,8). Possible enemy moves:\n- UP to (6,9): Empty.\n- DOWN to (6,7): Empty.\n- LEFT to (5,8): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (7,8): That's its own body segment (neck) \u2013 unsafe.\nEnemy has three safe moves. The closest apple to enemy is (5,9) at distance 2. Enemy might move UP to (6,9) or LEFT to (5,8) to approach it. Enemy is far from me (Manhattan distance |3-6|+|5-8|=3+3=6), so head-on collision is extremely unlikely this turn.\n\n**Future mobility after each move:**\n- RIGHT to (4,5) (eat apple): After eating, my body grows: new head at (4,5), old head becomes neck, tail stays at (3,9) for now. Next turn body: head (4,5), neck (3,5), then (3,6),(3,7),(3,8),(3,9). Possible moves from (4,5): UP to (4,6) \u2013 empty, DOWN to (4,4) \u2013 empty, LEFT to (3,5) \u2013 neck (unsafe), RIGHT to (5,5) \u2013 empty. So 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good mobility.\n- DOWN to (3,4): Next turn body: head (3,4), neck (3,5), (3,6),(3,7),(3,8), tail (3,9). Possible moves: UP to (3,5) \u2013 neck (unsafe), DOWN to (3,3) \u2013 empty, LEFT to (2,4) \u2013 empty, RIGHT to (4,4) \u2013 empty. So 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). But I'm moving away from apples.\n- LEFT to (2,5): Next turn body: head (2,5), neck (3,5), (3,6),(3,7),(3,8),(3,9). Possible moves: UP to (2,6) \u2013 empty, DOWN to (2,4) \u2013 empty, LEFT to (1,5) \u2013 empty, RIGHT to (3,5) \u2013 neck (unsafe). So 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT). Also moving away from apples.\n\n**Strategic consideration:**\nEnemy has 8 apples vs my 3. I need to catch up quickly. Apple at (4,5) is right there. Eating it now gains me a point and grows my body, which can be both an advantage (longer reach) and a constraint (harder to maneuver). But since the board is still relatively open, growth is good.\n\nMoving RIGHT to eat the apple is the most direct way to score. It also positions me near other apples: (5,3) is 2 cells away, (5,9) is 4 cells away. After eating, I can consider next moves toward (5,3) or (5,9).\n\nEnemy might be heading for (5,9). If I eat (4,5) now, I might be in a race for (5,3) next.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:**\nAfter eating apple at (4,5), assess safety and target the next closest apple (likely (5,3) or (5,9)). Avoid moving toward enemy if it's approaching the same apple. Keep an eye on enemy's long body; it may block paths. Prioritize staying alive and maintaining mobility.\n\nGiven all factors, the best move is RIGHT to eat the apple immediately.\n\nRIGHT",

Monitor Snake #1\u2019s movement toward the central apple (4,5); if it moves to claim (4,5), adjust path to either block its access (if safe) or shift focus to the (5,3) apple to maintain the 5-apple score gap.\n3. Continue to first eliminate deadly moves, then rank remaining options by follow-up flexibility and apple proximity.\n4. Avoid lower-edge apples (0,0), (8,0) for now as they are far and risk trapping you near the board\u2019s bottom edge.\n\nLEFT",

SAFE.\n- **DOWN to (4,4)**: Empty cell. SAFE.\n- **LEFT to (3,5)**: This is my own body segment (the neck). Moving backwards into your own body kills you. **NOT SAFE.**\n- **RIGHT to (5,5)**: Empty cell. SAFE.\n\n**Safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.**\n\n**Apple Proximity & Targeting:**\n- Closest apple is at **(4,7)** - Manhattan distance |4-4| + |5-7| = 0 + 2 = 2.\n- Other apples: (5,3) distance 3, (5,9) distance 5, (0,0) distance 9, (8,0) distance 9.\n- **UP to (4,6)** moves me closer to apple (4,7) (distance becomes 1).\n- **RIGHT to (5,5)** moves me closer to apples (5,3) and (5,9).\n- **DOWN to (4,4)** moves me away from all nearby apples.\n\n**Enemy Threat Assessment:**\nEnemy head at (5,8). Its possible moves:\n- UP to (5,9): Apple cell. Likely choice.\n- DOWN to (5,7): Empty.\n- LEFT to (4,8): Empty.\n- RIGHT to (6,8): Its own body (neck) - unsafe.\nEnemy will likely move UP to eat apple (5,9). If it does, its new head will be at (5,9), growing by 1 segment. This puts it at distance 4 from me (|4-5|+|5-9|=1+4=5). No immediate head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n**Future Mobility After Each Safe Move:**\n- **UP to (4,6)**: Next turn body: head (4,6), neck (4,5), then (3,5),(3,6),(3,7),(3,8). Possible moves from (4,6): UP to (4,7) - apple (safe), DOWN to (4,5) - neck (unsafe), LEFT to (3,6) - my body (unsafe), RIGHT to (5,6) - empty. So 2 safe moves (UP, RIGHT). Good path to immediate apple next turn.\n- **RIGHT to (5,5)**: Next turn body: head (5,5), neck (4,5), then (3,5),(3,6),(3,7),(3,8). Possible moves: UP to (5,6) - empty, DOWN to (5,4) - empty, LEFT to (4,5) - neck (unsafe), RIGHT to (6,5) - empty. So 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good mobility, positions near apples (5,3) and (5,9).\n- **DOWN to (4,4)**: Next turn body: head (4,4), neck (4,5), then (3,5),(3,6),(3,7),(3,8). Possible moves: UP to (4,5) - neck (unsafe), DOWN to (4,3) - empty, LEFT to (3,4) - empty, RIGHT to (5,4) - empty. So 3 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). But moves me away from all apples.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nEnemy has 8 apples vs my 4. I need to catch up. Apple at (4,7) is very close - I could reach it in 2 turns (UP this turn, UP next turn to eat). Apple at (5,3) is also reachable but enemy might target (5,9) first.\n\nMoving UP positions me perfectly to eat (4,7) next turn. However, I must consider if enemy could intercept or collide with me. Enemy is far away at (5,8) and likely moving UP to (5,9). No collision risk.\n\nMoving RIGHT gives good mobility and keeps options open for (5,3) or (5,9) later, but delays eating the closest apple.\n\n**Long-term Plan for Next Few Turns:**\nIf I move UP this turn to (4,6):\n1. Next turn (turn 26): Move UP to (4,7) to eat apple. My body grows to length 6.\n2. After eating, assess: Enemy likely at (5,9) or nearby. Consider moving toward (5,3) or (0,0) while avoiding enemy's long body.\n3. Maintain safe distance from enemy while targeting apples.\n\nGiven enemy's lead (8 vs 4), I need to prioritize apple collection efficiently. UP \u2192 then UP to eat (4,7) is the fastest way to gain an apple while maintaining reasonable safety.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nUP is safe, moves me toward the closest apple, sets up immediate consumption next turn, and maintains adequate future options.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** Move UP to eat apple at (4,7), then assess board for next target while avoiding enemy collision.\n\nUP",

Distance 1.\n- Apple at **(4,4)** is two cells below my head, but DOWN is unsafe.\n- Apple at (5,3) distance |4-5|+|6-3|=1+3=4.\n- Other apples are far.\n\n**Enemy Threat Assessment:**\nEnemy head at (5,9). Its possible moves:\n- UP: off board (death) \u2192 unlikely.\n- DOWN to (5,8): its own body (neck) \u2192 unsafe.\n- LEFT to (4,9): empty.\n- RIGHT to (6,9): empty.\nEnemy will likely move LEFT or RIGHT to stay alive. It has no adjacent apple.\n\nNo immediate head-on collision risk: enemy is at (5,9), I'm at (4,6). Even if it moves LEFT to (4,9), we are 3 cells apart vertically.\n\n**Future Mobility After Each Safe Move:**\n- **UP to (4,7) and eat apple**: My body grows by 1 segment. New head at (4,7), body becomes: head (4,7), then (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). Length 6. From (4,7), possible next moves: UP to (4,8) empty, DOWN to (4,6) my body (unsafe), LEFT to (3,7) my body (unsafe), RIGHT to (5,7) empty. So 2 safe moves (UP, RIGHT). Eating apple gains a point and extends my body, but reduces immediate mobility to 2 safe directions.\n- **RIGHT to (5,6)**: No apple eaten. Body: head (5,6), then (4,6), (4,5), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). Length remains 5. From (5,6), possible moves: UP to (5,7) empty, DOWN to (5,5) empty, LEFT to (4,6) my body (unsafe), RIGHT to (6,6) empty. So 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT). Good mobility, positions me closer to apple at (5,3) (distance now 3).\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nEnemy has 9 apples vs my 4. I need to catch up quickly. Eating the apple at (4,7) now is the fastest way to gain a point. However, after eating, my mobility is reduced to 2 safe moves next turn. That could be risky if the enemy approaches. But currently enemy is far and not an immediate threat.\n\nMoving RIGHT preserves high mobility and keeps me in a central area with access to multiple apples (5,3) and possibly (4,4) later if I can loop around. But it delays gaining a point.\n\nGiven the enemy's lead, I should prioritize eating apples efficiently. UP to eat the apple now is the best short-term gain.\n\n**Long-term Plan for Next Few Turns:**\n1. This turn: Move UP to eat apple at (4,7). Score becomes 5.\n2. Next turn (turn 27): From (4,7), I'll have safe moves UP to (4,8) or RIGHT to (5,7). I should assess enemy position and choose a move that avoids getting trapped and moves toward another apple (maybe (5,3) or (4,4) via a longer route).\n3. After eating, my longer body may limit tight spaces, so I need to plan paths that don't box me in.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nUP is safe, gives me an immediate apple, and helps close the score gap. The reduced mobility next turn is an acceptable risk given the distance to the enemy.\n\nUP",

After moving LEFT to (4,9), prioritize the (4,7) apple (closest reachable) with safe down moves; avoid up (off board) or right (own body) in next turns.\n2. Monitor Enemy Snake #1\u2019s movement toward (4,7) or (5,3) apples\u2014if they target (4,7), shift focus to (5,3) to maintain your 5-apple score gap without risky encounters.\n3. Continue eliminating deadly moves first, then ranking by apple proximity and follow-up mobility; avoid lower-edge apples (0,0), (8,0) for now (high distance + trap risk).\n4. If Enemy Snake #1\u2019s head moves toward your body post-LEFT move, block their path only if it doesn\u2019t risk self-collision or entrapment.\n\nLEFT",

Its possible moves:\n- UP: off board \u2192 death.\n- DOWN to (4,8): empty (same cell I could move UP into).\n- LEFT to (3,9): empty.\n- RIGHT to (5,9): its own body (neck) \u2192 unsafe.\nEnemy will likely move DOWN or LEFT to stay alive.  \n**Critical: If enemy moves DOWN to (4,8) and I move UP to (4,8), we have a head\u2011on collision \u2192 both die.**  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (3,9), it stays away.\n\nGiven the enemy\u2019s lead (9 apples vs my 5), a head\u2011on collision would lose me the game. I must avoid (4,8) if there\u2019s a chance enemy goes there.\n\n**Future Mobility After Each Safe Move:**\n- **UP to (4,8)**: If enemy is not there, it\u2019s empty. From (4,8), next moves: UP to (4,9) enemy\u2019s current head (empty after it moves) \u2013 likely safe if enemy left; DOWN to (4,7) my body (unsafe); LEFT to (3,8) empty; RIGHT to (5,8) enemy body segment (unsafe). So 2 safe moves (UP, LEFT) if enemy vacates (4,9). Risk of collision this turn.\n- **RIGHT to (5,7)**: Empty. From (5,7), next moves: UP to (5,8) enemy body (unsafe); DOWN to (5,6) empty; LEFT to (4,7) my body (unsafe); RIGHT to (6,7) empty. So 2 safe moves (DOWN, RIGHT). No collision risk this turn, and positions me closer to apple at (5,3) (distance reduces to 4).\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nEnemy\u2019s safest move is LEFT to (3,9) (avoids off\u2011board and its body). If it moves DOWN to (4,8), it risks hitting me if I go UP, but also risks hitting me if I go RIGHT? No, (5,7) is safe regardless.  \nGiven the enemy\u2019s long body and high score, it will likely play conservatively and choose LEFT. However, I cannot assume that.  \nMoving RIGHT avoids all collision risk this turn, maintains safe distance, and progresses toward apple at (5,3).  \nMoving UP risks a fatal collision if enemy chooses DOWN.\n\n**Long\u2011term Plan for Next Few Turns:**\n1. This turn: Move RIGHT to (5,7) \u2013 safe, no collision risk, moves toward apple at (5,3).\n2. Next turn: From (5,7), assess enemy position. Likely safe moves DOWN to (5,6) or RIGHT to (6,7). Choose the one that improves path to (5,3) while keeping escape routes.\n3. Goal: Close the apple gap (currently 9 vs 5). Target nearest apples (5,3) then (4,4) via a looping path that avoids trapping myself.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nRIGHT is safe, avoids potential head\u2011on collision, and progresses toward an apple. UP carries an unnecessary risk of simultaneous death.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe moves: DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### Step 2: Rank Safe Moves by Key Criteria\n1. **Head-on collision risk (simultaneous movement check)**:\n   - Enemy Snake #1\u2019s possible new heads (from (5,7)): (5,8), (5,6), (4,7), (6,7).\n   - Neither my DOWN (3,8) nor LEFT (2,9) new heads overlap with enemy possible positions \u2192 no collision risk for either.\n2. **Apple proximity (Manhattan distance)**:\n   - DOWN (3,8): Closest apple (4,4) \u2192 distance 5.\n   - LEFT (2,9): Closest apple (4,4) \u2192 distance 7 \u2192 DOWN is closer.\n3. **Follow-up options assessment (safe moves from new head)**:\n   - DOWN (3,8): 3 safe follow-up moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) \u2192 high mobility, low entrapment risk.\n   - LEFT (2,9): 2 safe follow-up moves (DOWN, LEFT) \u2192 lower mobility than DOWN.\n\n### Long-Term Plan for Future Self (Next 3 Turns)\n1. After current move, prioritize moving toward the (4,4) apple (closest reachable) while monitoring Snake 1\u2019s position to avoid their head/body as they shift toward lower y-coordinates.\n2. Continue eliminating off-board/self-collision moves first, then rank remaining moves by apple proximity and follow-up mobility (aim for \u22652 safe follow-up options to avoid entrapment).\n3. Avoid overextending toward the top edge (Y=9) to preserve movement flexibility; use downward/horizontal moves to maintain board coverage.\n4. Ignore lower-edge apples (0,0), (8,0) for now due to high distance and trap risks; target (5,3) or (8,5) as secondary options once (4,4) is within safer reach.\n\nDOWN",

Its safe moves: DOWN to (3,8) or LEFT to (2,9). Neither intersects my safe moves (DOWN to (5,6) or RIGHT to (6,7)). No risk of head-on collision this turn.\n\n**Apple Proximity & Strategic Direction:**\nClosest apples: (5,3) and (4,4) both Manhattan distance 4 from (5,7).\n- **DOWN to (5,6)**: Reduces distance to (5,3) to 3 and to (4,4) to 3.\n- **RIGHT to (6,7)**: Increases distance to both apples to 5.\n\nDOWN is clearly better for apple collection. It moves toward the cluster of apples in the lower-left, while RIGHT moves toward the right edge where enemy body segments are more dense.\n\n**Future Mobility After Each Safe Move:**\n- **DOWN to (5,6)**: Next turn, safe moves likely DOWN to (5,5) and RIGHT to (6,6) (both empty). Provides a path downward toward (5,3).\n- **RIGHT to (6,7)**: Next turn, safe moves likely DOWN to (6,6) and RIGHT to (7,7). Moves away from nearest apples and closer to enemy body.\n\n**Long-term Plan for Next Few Turns:**\n1. This turn: Move DOWN to (5,6) \u2013 safe, no collision risk, reduces distance to nearest apples.\n2. Next turn: From (5,6), aim to continue DOWN toward (5,5) if safe, then (5,4), and eventually (5,3). Also consider apple at (4,4) by possibly moving LEFT after descending further (e.g., from (5,4) go LEFT to (4,4) if clear).\n3. Monitor enemy movements; it is currently far away and likely to stay in the top-left area. Avoid moving into confined spaces near enemy body.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nDOWN is safe, optimally progresses toward the nearest apples, and maintains good future mobility.\n\nDOWN",

After moving, my body will shift: new head (5,5), then (5,6), (5,7), (4,7), (4,6), (4,5), (3,5). So (4,5) will be occupied next turn (by my 6th segment), so LEFT from (5,5) would be into own body \u2014 not safe. So from (5,5) only DOWN and RIGHT will be safe. That\u2019s still fine, leads toward apple at (5,3).  \n- **RIGHT to (6,6)**: Next turn from (6,6), safe moves likely DOWN to (6,5), RIGHT to (7,6), UP to (6,7)? UP to (6,7) is empty now, but my body will be at (5,6) so safe. So 3 safe moves possible, but moves away from nearest apples.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan for next few turns:**  \n1. This turn: Move DOWN to (5,5) \u2014 safe, reduces distance to nearest apples, keeps path open to (5,3).  \n2. Next turn: From (5,5), move DOWN to (5,4) if safe (likely), then to (5,3) to eat apple.  \n3. After eating (5,3), consider (4,4) by moving LEFT from (5,3) to (4,3) then UP to (4,4) if path clear.  \n4. Monitor enemy movement; it\u2019s currently far in top-left area and likely staying there. Avoid moving toward its body cluster at top-right.\n\n---\n\n**Final decision:** DOWN is safe, optimal for apple proximity, and maintains future mobility toward apple cluster.  \n\nDOWN",
