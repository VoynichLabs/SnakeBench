(6,3): distance = |5\u22126|+|9\u22123| = 1+6=7  \n2. (7,5): distance = 2+4=6  \n3. (3,4): distance = 2+5=7  \n4. (1,4): distance = 4+5=9  \n5. (0,7): distance = 5+2=7  \n\nActually (7,5) is closest in moves if we go right then down repeatedly. But right now, moving DOWN from (5,9) gets me closer to all apples except (0,7) maybe.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each move\nFrom (5,9):\n\n- **DOWN to (5,8):**  \n  Next moves: UP (back to (5,9), empty for now), DOWN (5,7), LEFT (4,8), RIGHT (6,8). All inside board, no bodies \u2192 4 options next turn.\n\n- **LEFT to (4,9):**  \n  Next moves: UP (off board \u2192 no), DOWN (4,8), LEFT (3,9), RIGHT (back to (5,9)) \u2192 3 options next turn.\n\n- **RIGHT to (6,9):**  \n  Next moves: UP (off board \u2192 no), DOWN (6,8), LEFT (back to (5,9)), RIGHT (7,9) \u2192 3 options next turn.\n\nSo DOWN gives more future safe moves.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Long-term plan\nI want to avoid trapping myself early. The board is mostly empty. Heading toward center (around y=5) gives more flexibility. DOWN moves toward multiple apples and keeps options open.\n\n---\n\n**Next turn plan:** Move toward (7,5) or (6,3) gradually while avoiding walls and keeping escape routes. Enemy far away for now, so focus on growth.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",

No immediate head-on collision possible.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity  \nFrom (6,8):  \n- (7,5): dist = |6\u22127| + |8\u22125| = 1 + 3 = 4  \n- (6,3): dist = 0 + 5 = 5  \n- (3,4): dist = 3 + 4 = 7  \n- (0,7): dist = 6 + 1 = 7  \n- (1,4): dist = 5 + 4 = 9  \n\nClosest apple is (7,5) at distance 4.  \nMoving DOWN to (6,7) reduces distance to (7,5) to 3 (|6\u22127|+|7\u22125| = 1+2=3).  \nMoving LEFT to (5,8) increases distance to (7,5) to 5.  \nMoving UP to (6,9) increases distance to 6.  \nMoving RIGHT to (7,8) increases distance to 3 (|7\u22127|+|8\u22125|=0+3=3) \u2014 actually same as DOWN\u2019s new distance.  \n\nSo DOWN and RIGHT both get me closer to (7,5) equally well (distance 3 after move).  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each move\nFrom (6,8):  \n\n- **UP to (6,9):** Next moves: DOWN (back), LEFT (5,9), RIGHT (7,9) \u2192 3 options (UP off board).  \n- **DOWN to (6,7):** Next moves: UP (back), DOWN (6,6), LEFT (5,7), RIGHT (7,7) \u2192 4 options.  \n- **LEFT to (5,8):** Next moves: UP (5,9), DOWN (5,7), LEFT (4,8), RIGHT (6,8) \u2192 4 options.  \n- **RIGHT to (7,8):** Next moves: UP (7,9), DOWN (7,7), LEFT (6,8), RIGHT (8,8) \u2192 4 options.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Avoid boxing myself / long-term plan  \nI want to eat (7,5) eventually. From (6,7) after DOWN, I could go RIGHT then DOWN toward it. From (7,8) after RIGHT, I\u2019d need to go DOWN twice.  \n\nMoving DOWN now keeps me central and has more options next turn (still 4). Moving RIGHT puts me closer to right edge slightly but still safe.  \n\nEnemy is far left, so moving DOWN or RIGHT is safe from enemy.  \n\nGiven last turn I chose RIGHT, continuing RIGHT again might corner me on right edge later. Better to start moving DOWN toward the apple directly.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:** Move DOWN now, then RIGHT next turn toward (7,5), keeping options open and avoiding walls. Monitor enemy movement toward (1,4) apple.  \n\nDOWN",

Eating apples quickly is good because game ends at 50 apples.  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Decision**  \nDOWN puts me 1 step from apple (6,3) to eat next turn, keeps options open, no risk.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove DOWN to (6,4) this turn. Next turn move DOWN to (6,3) to eat apple unless enemy threatens that cell. After eating, consider moving toward (8,3) or (4,3) depending on enemy position. Keep distance from enemy head to avoid head-on collisions.  \n\nDOWN",

Wait, check: current body: (4, 4) is head, then (4, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2). So (3, 3) is empty. So LEFT then DOWN to (3, 3) is safe. Also RIGHT (4, 4) is body \u2014 unsafe. So 3 safe moves after LEFT.  \n- RIGHT (5, 4): next moves: UP (5, 5), DOWN (5, 3), RIGHT (6, 4) \u2014 but (6, 4) is enemy body \u2014 unsafe. So safe moves: UP, DOWN \u2014 only 2 safe moves.  \n\nSo RIGHT reduces future mobility because enemy body blocks (6, 4).  \n\n**Long-term strategy:**  \nEnemy is at (7, 3) and likely to go RIGHT (8, 3) to eat apple, or UP/DOWN. That will move it away from me. I should move toward apples at (8, 3) and (9, 3) but avoid getting blocked.  \n\nBest choice: UP to (4, 5) for mobility, then next turn go RIGHT (5, 5) and down toward apples, or go LEFT then down to (1, 3) if path clears.  \n\nUP keeps options open and avoids immediate risk.  \n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP",

Enemy head at (8, 2) \u2014 possible next apple (9, 3) or (8, 2) itself.\n- (1, 9) is also far.\n\n**Enemy threat:**\nSnake #1 head (8, 2):\nPossible moves: UP (8, 3) safe? (8, 3) is their own body? Wait, body list: [(8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5)], so (8, 3) is their body \u2014 unsafe for them.\nSo their safe moves from (8, 2):\n- UP (8, 3): body \u2014 unsafe.\n- DOWN (8, 1): empty, safe.\n- LEFT (7, 2): empty, safe.\n- RIGHT (9, 2): empty, safe.\n\nSo enemy can't go UP. They will likely go RIGHT toward (9, 3) apple, or LEFT/DOWN for safety.  \nThey may compete for (9, 3) but maybe not next turn \u2014 right now they're not adjacent to it.\n\nThus, minimal direct collision risk for me in 1 turn.\n\n**Future mobility:**\nBefore choosing, check next-move safety:\n- UP (4, 7): next moves: UP (4, 8), LEFT (3, 7), RIGHT (5, 7) \u2014 all empty.\n- LEFT (3, 6): next moves: UP (3, 7), DOWN (3, 5), LEFT (2, 6) \u2014 all empty.\n- RIGHT (5, 6): next moves: UP (5, 7), DOWN (5, 5), RIGHT (6, 6) \u2014 all empty.\n\nAll have 3 safe follow-ups.  \nRIGHT takes me closer to (9, 3) but enemy there; UP gives flexibility to go left/right later; LEFT goes toward apples (1, 3).\n\n**Long-term plan reasoning:**\nNext moves: After UP, I can go LEFT toward (0, 7) or (1, 9) easily. After RIGHT, I'd be closer to enemy's future path \u2014 more risky. After LEFT, maybe corner myself if enemy comes that way.\n\nUP keeps options open for multiple apples.\n\nBest: **UP** for flexibility.\n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Apples strategy:\nClosest apples are at (0, 8) NW, (0, 7) W, and (1, 9) NW.\nThe enemy is far away in the SE region.\n\nBest approach: move toward the cluster of apples in the top-left corner.\nFrom (4,8):\n- UP (4,9): then can go LEFT toward (1,9) or (0,8).\n- LEFT (3,8): then can go UP to (3,9) and toward apple (1,9).\n- RIGHT (5,8): takes me away from the apple cluster, less desirable.\n\nSo LEFT or UP are better for apples.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Their safe moves: DOWN (7,0), LEFT (6,1), RIGHT (8,1) \u2014 wait, RIGHT (8,1) is their own body segment \u2014 no, that\u2019s their neck actually (looking at body: head (7,1) \u2192 (8,1) is first body segment, so they can't go right into their own neck).

But I\u2019m not eating apple now, so (6,3) will be empty next turn. Wait, tail is at (7,3), last body segment is (7,3), so (6,3) is free now and will stay free.

Not directly closer to (1,3) but opens central area.  \nLEFT moves directly toward (1,3) apple.  \n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Risk assessment**  \nEnemy at (3,8) moving UP/DOWN/LEFT \u2014 not threatening my area yet.  \nEdge risk: DOWN to (6,0) reduces options next turn \u2014 avoid unless necessary.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Decision**  \nBoth UP and LEFT keep good mobility. LEFT is toward more apples (left side cluster). UP keeps me central. Given my last move was LEFT, continuing LEFT may keep momentum toward apples while staying safe.  \n\nBut checking board: Apple at (1,3) is closer horizontally from (5,1) than from (6,2). So LEFT gets me closer to that apple faster.  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Plan for next turns**  \nAfter LEFT to (5,1), next turn I can go UP toward (1,3) or continue LEFT toward (0,7)/(0,8). Keep enemy in mind \u2014 they are far top-left. Avoid trapping myself near left edge later.  \n\n**Final choice:** LEFT maximizes apple progress while keeping good mobility.  \n\nLEFT",

Currently near bottom-left area; moving LEFT continues toward edge but not yet dangerous.\n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Plan for next turns**  \nAfter LEFT to (4,1), next turn I can go UP toward (1,3) or continue LEFT toward (0,7)/(0,8). Keep an eye on enemy movement \u2014 they are top-left but moving unpredictably. Maintain central mobility while closing in on apples.\n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Decision**  \nBoth UP and LEFT are safe and keep 3 options next turn. LEFT gets me closer to the nearest apple faster.  \n\nLEFT",

Currently enemy is far from me, but if I move UP toward (1,3) apple, I could converge paths later.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple targeting**  \nApples: (0,7), (9,3), (1,3), (0,8), (1,9).  \nClosest to me: (1,3) at distance |3-1|+|1-3| = 2+2=4.  \n(0,7) and (0,8) are farther; (9,3) is far right; (1,9) is top left near enemy.  \nBest immediate target: (1,3).  \nFrom (3,1):  \n- LEFT to (2,1): distance to (1,3) = |2-1|+|1-3| = 1+2=3.  \n- UP to (3,2): distance = |3-1|+|2-3| = 2+1=3.  \n- DOWN to (3,0): distance = |3-1|+|0-3| = 2+3=5 \u2192 worse.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility**  \nFrom (2,1) after LEFT:  \nNext turn safe moves from (2,1):  \nUP(2,2) empty, DOWN(2,0) empty, LEFT(1,1) empty, RIGHT(3,1) my body (but will move away? Wait, my body currently ends at (8,1), so (3,1) will be empty next turn if I move LEFT now? Let\u2019s check: if I move LEFT to (2,1), my body shifts: new head (2,1), then (3,1) becomes neck, then (4,1), etc. So (3,1) is occupied next turn by my neck \u2192 can\u2019t go RIGHT next turn.) Actually: after moving LEFT, my body becomes [(2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1)]. So (3,1) is my body segment \u2192 RIGHT from (2,1) next turn is death. So from (2,1) safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT \u2192 3 safe moves.\n\nFrom (3,2) after UP:  \nNext turn from (3,2): UP(3,3) empty, DOWN(3,1) my neck \u2192 death, LEFT(2,2) empty, RIGHT(4,2) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.\n\nFrom (3,0) after DOWN:  \nNext turn from (3,0): UP(3,1) my neck \u2192 death, DOWN off board \u2192 death, LEFT(2,0) empty, RIGHT(4,0) empty \u2192 2 safe moves \u2192 eliminate DOWN.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Risk of head-on collision**  \nEnemy at (1,7) could move DOWN to (1,6), LEFT to (0,7), RIGHT to (2,7).  \nIf I go LEFT to (2,1), enemy is far (distance 5+). No immediate collision risk.  \nIf I go UP to (3,2), still safe.  \nBut if enemy goes DOWN multiple steps, it might head toward (1,3) apple too. I want to get there first.\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan**  \nGoal: secure (1,3) apple, then maybe (0,7) or (0,8) if enemy hasn\u2019t taken them. Keep away from enemy\u2019s path toward top-left apples. Maintain mobility in center/left side.\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**  \nLEFT and UP both give 3 safe moves next turn and equal Manhattan distance to (1,3).  \nLEFT gets me horizontally closer to (1,3) and also closer to left-edge apples later.  \nUP keeps me more central but vertical progress toward apple is same net distance.  \nI prefer LEFT because it progresses toward apple horizontally and away from enemy\u2019s current vertical path.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter LEFT to (2,1), next turn likely UP toward (1,3) apple. Monitor enemy movement \u2014 they may go for (0,7) or (1,9). Avoid moving into potential head-on collision paths.\n\nLEFT",

They might go DOWN toward (1, 3) apple later, but I can reach (1, 3) in 1 turn after going UP now.  \nEven if enemy goes RIGHT (1, 6) then DOWN (1, 5) etc., they are 4 moves from (1, 3). I\u2019ll get there first.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Long-term plan after eating (1, 3)**  \nAfter eating (1, 3), I\u2019ll have length 7. Then I can go to (0, 3) or (2, 3) depending on safety.  \nNext target could be (5, 6) or (9, 3), but avoid moving toward enemy\u2019s path.  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Final decision**  \nUP maximizes apple proximity, future mobility, and is safe.  \n\nUP",

Tail (0, 6) gone.  \nFrom (2, 9):  \n- UP \u2192 off board \u2192 dead \u2192 eliminated.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 8) \u2192 body segment \u2192 dead \u2192 eliminated.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 9) \u2192 apple there \u2192 safe (eating apple grows tail, so tail stays at (1, 6) instead of disappearing). Actually, let\u2019s check:  \nIf I eat apple at (1, 9), my body becomes: (1, 9), (2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 6).  \nThen from (1, 9):  \nUP \u2192 off board \u2192 dead.  \nDOWN \u2192 (1, 8) empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (0, 9) empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (2, 9) body segment \u2192 dead.  \nSo only 2 safe moves next turn (DOWN, LEFT) if I eat the apple.  \nIf I don\u2019t eat apple (but there is one at (1, 9)), so I must eat it if I go LEFT from (2, 9).  \n\nWait \u2014 correction: moving UP to (2, 9) does not eat an apple; apple is at (1, 9). So no growth.  \nFrom (2, 9):  \nPossible moves:  \nUP \u2192 off board \u2192 dead.  \nDOWN \u2192 (2, 8) body \u2192 dead.  \nLEFT \u2192 (1, 9) apple \u2192 safe (eating apple \u2192 grow \u2192 tail stays at (1, 6)).  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3, 9) empty.  \nSo safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT (2 options).  \n\n**LEFT to (1, 8):**  \nNo apple eaten \u2192 body: (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 6). Tail (0, 6) gone.  \nFrom (1, 8):  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 9) apple \u2192 safe (eat \u2192 grow \u2192 tail stays at (1, 6)).  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 7) empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 8) apple \u2192 safe (eat \u2192 grow).  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 8) body \u2192 dead.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, LEFT).  \n\n**RIGHT to (3, 8):**  \nNo apple eaten \u2192 body: (3, 8), (2, 8), (2, 7), (2, 6), (1, 6). Tail (0, 6) gone.  \nFrom (3, 8):  \n- UP \u2192 (3, 9) empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3, 7) empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2, 8) body \u2192 dead.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4, 8) empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apples and opponent**  \nApples: (9, 3), (0, 8), (1, 9), (5, 6), (9, 5).  \nSnake #1 head at (1, 5), body: [(1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1)].  \nSnake #1 possible moves:  \n- UP to (1, 6) \u2192 my body segment at (1, 6) \u2192 Snake #1 dies.  \n- DOWN to (1, 4) \u2192 its own body \u2192 dies.  \n- LEFT to (0, 5) empty.  \n- RIGHT to (2, 5) empty.  \nSo Snake #1 will likely choose LEFT or RIGHT.  \n\nApple at (1, 9) is close if I go UP then LEFT, or go LEFT then UP.  \nApple at (0, 8) is close if I go LEFT then LEFT.  \n\nSnake #1 is not an immediate threat since it\u2019s 3 cells away in y-direction and blocked by my body at (1, 6) if it goes UP.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Compare options**  \n- UP: only 2 safe moves next turn (LEFT to apple, RIGHT), risk of being near top edge.  \n- LEFT: 3 safe moves next turn, close to apples (0, 8) and (1, 9).  \n- RIGHT: 3 safe moves next turn, but apples are farther.  \n\nLEFT seems best because it keeps more options and gets closer to two apples.  \n\n**Short-term plan:** Move LEFT to (1, 8) to approach apples at (0, 8) and (1, 9), giving flexibility next turn to eat either.  \n\nLEFT",

Moving RIGHT (2, 5) puts me closer to enemy\u2019s possible path toward (5, 6) apple. UP (1, 6) moves toward (1, 9) apple and away from enemy\u2019s current area. Safer to avoid potential confrontation while I\u2019m longer.  \n\n**Step 8 \u2013 Plan for next few turns**  \nGoal: Secure top apples (1, 9) and (0, 8). After UP to (1, 6), next turn I can go UP toward (1, 9) or LEFT toward (0, 8). Keep mobility high. Avoid moving toward enemy\u2019s likely path to (5, 6).  \n\n**Step 9 \u2013 Final decision**  \nUP keeps good mobility, moves toward closest apple (1, 9), avoids enemy zone.  \n\nUP",
