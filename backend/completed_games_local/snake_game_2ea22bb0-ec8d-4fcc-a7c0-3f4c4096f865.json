I am size 1.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head at (0, 6). Body is empty. 0 apples. Size 1.\n*   **Apples:** (9, 6), (9, 8), (6, 1), (7, 1), (1, 1).\n*   **Objective:** Eat apples without dying. First one to 50 wins.\n\n**Safety Check:**\nMoving from (3, 7):\n*   **UP:** (3, 8). Board is 10x10 (0-9). (3, 8) is valid. No snake bodies present. Safe.\n*   **DOWN:** (3, 6). Valid. Safe.\n*   **LEFT:** (2, 7). Valid. Safe.\n*   **RIGHT:** (4, 7). Valid. Safe.\n*   **Backwards:** Since I have no body, I cannot hit myself by moving backwards.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nThere are five apples on the board.\n*   **Top Cluster:** (9, 6) and (9, 8) are far right. Enemy is at (0, 6), so they are likely going Left or staying put initially. I could go Right to pursue the top cluster, but it takes many turns (at least 6) to reach them.\n*   **Bottom Cluster:** (6, 1) and (7, 1) are on the bottom row.\n*   **Isolated:** (1, 1) is bottom left.\n\nSince it is Turn 0, distance is a factor. However, I want to keep my options open. Moving **UP** to (3, 8) places me in a position to access the right side of the board. If I go Right, I commit to the Right side. If I go Left, I am near the Enemy (0, 6), which is risky for a head-on collision. If I go Down, I move towards the bottom apples, but I am currently in a good central position.\n\n**Decision:**\nI will move **UP**. This maintains distance from the Enemy (who is at y=6) and keeps me on the board's upper half where the apples at (9,8) and (9,6) are located. It also avoids the immediate clutter of the bottom row apples, giving me time to assess the enemy's first move.\n\nMy plan is to head towards the top-right apples (9, 6) and (9, 8) in the next few turns.\n\nUP",

The immediate cluster of apples at **(4, 6)** and **(3, 6)** are prime targets.\n*   **Move Analysis:**\n    *   **UP to (8, 7):** Moves towards the top wall and the apple at (3, 7). However, getting stuck against the top wall is risky.\n    *   **DOWN to (8, 5):** Moves towards the center of the board and opens up pathways to the apples at (4, 6) and (3, 6). This keeps the board open.\n    *   **LEFT to (7, 6):** This is the most aggressive move towards the center cluster. It places me directly adjacent to the apple at (6, 7) (which doesn't exist, but closer to the cluster) and prepares me to go for (4, 6) or (3, 6).\n    *   **RIGHT to (9, 6):** As mentioned, this keeps me against the wall. I want to escape the edges to maximize my maneuverability.\n\n**Decision**\n\nI will move **LEFT** to (7, 6). This move reduces the distance to the central apple cluster and moves me away from the dangerous right wall. It provides the most flexibility for future turns to target either (4, 6) or (3, 6). Since Snake #0 is occupied in the bottom right, I have a safe window to grab the central apples.\n\nLEFT",

It is a valid move. Even though the body is currently at (5, 6), by the time I move, the tail (8, 6) won't have moved yet (since I grew last turn), but the body segment (5, 6) will shift into (4, 6). Wait, actually, standard snake rules: If I ate last turn, I don't move this turn. So the tail stays. If I eat this turn, I grow, and the tail stays next turn too.\n    *   Actually, re-reading standard mechanics: \"If you move onto an apple... you grow\". \"Snake moves: ... the body follows\". Usually, if you eat, you don't lose length that turn.\n    *   Let's verify collision: My body is currently at (5, 6), (6, 6), (7, 6), (8, 6). Moving to (3, 6) puts me adjacent to (4, 6) and (5, 6). The only risk is if the body moves *into* me. Since I am growing, the tail stays. The segment at (5, 6) moves to (4, 6). The segment at (6, 6) moves to (5, 6). etc.\n    *   There is no immediate collision risk.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Target (5, 6).\n    *   **Status:** **DEADLY**\n    *   **Reason:** (5, 6) is currently my own body (the second segment).\n\n**Strategic Considerations**\n\n*   **Objective:** Continue expanding the lead (currently 5 vs 3) by eating the cluster of apples at x=3.\n*   **Move Analysis:**\n    *   **LEFT to (3, 6):** Eats an apple, moves towards the cluster. This is the optimal move.\n    *   **UP to (4, 7):** Safe, but misses the apple.\n    *   **DOWN to (4, 5):** Safe, but misses the apple and moves away from targets.\n    *   **RIGHT to (5, 6):** Suicide.\n\n**Decision**\n\nI will move **LEFT** to (3, 6).

With the body tail at (6, 3), they likely moved UP or RIGHT last turn. They are still far away and not an immediate threat to my head-to-head collision, but I must be mindful of their expansion.\n*   **Apples:** (0, 8), (2, 0), (8, 5), (0, 1), (0, 3)\n    *   **Immediate Target:** There is an apple at **(3, 8)** one step Up. There are also apples at (0, 8) and (0, 3) that are accessible if I head Left.\n\n**Safety Check (Moving from Head (3, 7))**\n\n1.  **UP:** Target (3, 8).\n    *   **Status:** **SAFE**\n    *   **Reason:** (3, 8) is inside the board and empty. It contains an apple.\n2.  **DOWN:** Target (3, 6).\n    *   **Status:** **DEADLY**\n    *   **Reason:** (3, 6) is my own body segment immediately behind my head. Moving here is moving backwards into myself.\n3.  **LEFT:** Target (2, 7).\n    *   **Status:** **SAFE**\n    *   **Reason:** (2, 7) is inside the board and empty.\n4.  **RIGHT:** Target (4, 7).\n    *   **Status:** **SAFE**\n    *   **Reason:** (4, 7) is inside the board and empty.\n\n**Strategic Considerations**\n\n*   **Objective:** Continue eating apples safely and maintain space.\n*   **Move Analysis:**\n    *   **UP to (3, 8):** This is the strongest move. It eats an apple, extending my length and score. After eating, my tail will not move next turn. Starting the next turn at (3, 8) with a long body allows me to access (4, 8), (2, 8), etc.\n    *   **RIGHT to (4, 7):** Safe. However, looking at the board, the cluster of apples is in the top left (x=0). Moving Right takes me away from that cluster toward the empty right side of the board.\n    *   **LEFT to (2, 7):** Safe. This moves me toward the top-left apple cluster. However, (3, 8) is an immediate apple that I can eat right now.\n    *   **DOWN:** Death.\n\n**Decision**\n\nMoving **UP** is the optimal choice. It secures a point immediately and positions my head at (3, 8). From there, on turn 19, I will be able to move Left to (2, 8) or Right to (4, 8), or possibly Down (if my tail moves from (3, 6) to (3, 5) or similar, creating space). Since I am eating, my tail will stay at (8, 6) for the next turn, but that is far enough away not to cause immediate issues.\n\nI will move UP.\n\nUP",

Situation Analysis:**\n*   **Turn:** 21 / 150.\n*   **My Position:** Head at (1, 8), Body: [(2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)]. Apples: 6.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Snake #0 Head at (1, 4), Body: [(2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 4)].\n*   **Apples:** (0, 8) is immediately available.\n\n**2. Move Evaluation (From Head (1, 8)):**\n*   **UP (1, 9):** Safe. Boundary valid, empty.\n*   **DOWN (1, 7):** Blocked. Occupied by my own body at (2, 8) -> (3, 8) -> (3, 7). Actually, checking the board state and body list: My body is at (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7)... so (1, 7) is empty? No, the body list shows (2, 8) is the neck. The board state shows T at (2, 8) and (3, 8) and T at (3, 7). Wait, the body list is `[(2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)]`. So the cell (1, 7) is not in the body list. However, looking at the board state:\n    ```\n     8 A 1 T T . . . . . .\n     7 . . . T . . . . . .\n    ```\n    My head is at (1, 8). The cell (1, 7) is empty in the board state. But wait, looking at the body coordinates: (2, 8) is the neck. (1, 7) is diagonally adjacent. The body continues from (2, 8) to (3, 8). So (1, 7) is actually empty. *Correction:* The body list shows `(3, 8)` is the second segment. So `(2, 8)` is the first body segment. `(3, 8)` is the second. `(3, 7)` is the third. `(1, 7)` is not in the list. The board state shows `.` at (1, 7). So DOWN is physically safe.\n    *However*, my goal is the apple at (0, 8). Moving DOWN takes me away from the target.\n*   **LEFT (0, 8):** **Target Apple**. Safe. Valid boundary. No snakes. My body is at (2, 8) and (3, 8), so (0, 8) is safe.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 8):** Blocked. Occupied by my own body (the neck).\n\n**3. Strategic Decision:**\n*   The apple at (0, 8) is the closest and most valuable immediate target. Moving **LEFT** collects it.\n*   Collecting this apple puts me at 7 apples.\n*   After collecting, my tail will remain stationary (or grow if I eat, technically the tail stays if I don't eat, but I am eating). *Wait, rule check:* \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\". This means the tail does not move this turn. My new body will be `[(0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)]`.\n*   Enemy Snake #0 is at (1, 4), far away. No immediate collision risk.\n*   Moving LEFT sets up the sweep of the left wall, where other apples exist at (0, 3) and (0, 1).\n\n**4. Final Choice:**\n*   Move **LEFT** to (0, 8) to eat the apple and secure points.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (0, 8). Proceed down the left wall to collect apples at (0, 3) and (0, 1). Monitor Snake #0, but currently the path is clear.\n\nLEFT",

Situation Analysis:**\n*   **Turn:** 22 / 150.\n*   **My Position:** Head at (0, 8), Body: [(1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)]. I ate the apple at (0, 8) last turn (confirmed by the board state showing '1' at (0,8) and the absence of the previous apple). I am now 8 apples long.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Snake #0 Head at (1, 4). Based on the previous turn, its head moved from (0, 4) to (1, 4) (RIGHT). This means its body occupies (0, 4) to (3, 4).\n*   **Apples:** (0, 6) is the next reachable target. (0, 3) and (0, 1) are further down.\n\n**2. Move Evaluation (From Head (0, 8)):**\n*   **UP (0, 9):** Safe (Boundary/Empty). Good for survival.\n*   **DOWN (0, 7):** Safe. Checks body: I am at (0, 8), (1, 8)... (3, 6). (0, 7) is clear. This moves towards the apple at (0, 6).\n*   **LEFT:** Impossible (Wall).\n*   **RIGHT (1, 8):** Blocked (My own body at (1, 8)).\n\n**3. Strategic Decision:**\n*   **Safety First:** We are at the top-left corner. The goal is to sweep down the left side to collect the apples at (0, 6), (0, 3), and (0, 1).\n*   **Path to Apple:** The apple at (0, 6) requires moving DOWN twice (from 8 to 7, then 7 to 6).\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   **UP (0, 9):** Leads to the corner (0, 9). From there, the only move is DOWN. This creates a rigid path and potentially traps me if the enemy moves unpredictably. It offers no immediate value towards apples.\n    *   **DOWN (0, 7):** Moves directly toward the apple at (0, 6). It maintains flexibility to move DOWN to (0, 6) or potentially move RIGHT to (1, 7) later (if clear) to avoid the tail.\n*   **Enemy Consideration:** Enemy is at (1, 4) / (0, 4). Far away and moving on the other side of my tail. Not an immediate threat.\n*   **Conclusion:** DOWN is the optimal move to reach the apple efficiently while maintaining better board control. If I go UP, I am forced to come back down immediately next turn. If I go DOWN now, I am one step closer to the apple and my body is clearing (1, 8) for future movement.\n\n**4.

(0, 6) is the board edge, effectively empty in the body check (values 'A'). The board state confirms 'A' at (0, 6) (row 6, col 0).\n    *   *Collision Check:* Enemy head is at (0, 3). They are 3 units away. They cannot reach (0, 6) in one turn. They might move UP to (0, 4), but that is still safe for me. Head-on collision is impossible.\n\n**3. Strategic Decision:**\n*   **Apple Acquisition:** The apple at (0, 6) is the nearest reachable apple. Moving DOWN secures it immediately.\n*   **Pathing:** I need to sweep the left column. After eating at (0, 6), I will likely need to navigate around the enemy at (0, 3) or wait for them to move. Staying in the column is the only way to get the other apples at (0, 3) and (0, 1).\n*   **Risk:** The only risk is the enemy moving UP and blocking me later, but taking the guaranteed point now is optimal. If I go RIGHT, I lose the apple and trap myself in the corner.\n*   **Conclusion:** DOWN is the only productive and safe move. It scores a point and continues the sweep.\n\n**4. Final Choice:**\nMove **DOWN** to (0, 6) to eat the apple.\n**END RATIONALE**\nDOWN",

Body: [(0, 7), (0, 8), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (4, 6)].\n    *   *Correction:* I am at (0, 6). The tail is at (4, 6). There is a gap in the body list provided, specifically at (0, 5). The board state confirms (0, 5) is empty. I did not grow on the last turn (no 'A' at (0, 6)), so the tail (4, 6) will move, keeping the gap at (0, 5) open for me.\n*   **Enemy Position:** Snake #0 Head at (0, 2), Body: [(0, 3), (0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 4)].\n*   **Apples:** (0, 1) is immediately below. (0, 3) is blocked by the enemy body. (0, 4) is also blocked. (0, 5) is empty (my tail moves from 4,6 to 4,5? No, tail is at 4,6, head at 0,6. The tail moves into 3,6).\n    *   Wait, let's re-check the board state. Row 5 has 'A' at (0,5)? No, row 5 is: `. . . . . . . . . A .` (A at (9,5)). Row 4 is: `T T T . . . . . . A`. Row 3: `T . . . . . . . . .`. Row 2: `0 . . . . . . . . .`. Row 1: `A . . . . . . . . .`. Row 0: `. . A . . . . . . .`.\n    *   So the apples are at: (2,0), (8,5), (0,1), (9,4), (4,9).\n    *   My current head (0,6). The spot below is (0,5). Is (0,5) an apple? No. Is it empty? Yes, per previous logic (gap) and board (row 5 col 0 is `.`).\n    *   Wait, looking at the board state provided *in the previous turn*, there was an apple at (0,6). I moved DOWN to (0,6) to eat it. If I ate it, I should have grown. But the new board state (the one in this prompt) does not show an 'A' at (0,6) or (0,5). It shows '.' at (0,6) and '.' at (0,5) (in the description of the board, row 6 is `1 . . T T ...`, row 5 is `. . . . . . . . A .`, so (0,5) is `.`).\n    *   Let's re-read the last move. I moved DOWN to (0,6). The board state *before* that move had an 'A' at (0,6) (row 6 in the old board was `. A ...`). Wait, the board state in the *previous* turn showed: `Row 6: . 1 . . T T ...`. Wait, in the previous turn, the head was at (0,7). The board showed row 7 as `T . . T ...` and row 6 as `...` (wait, previous board row 6: `Row 6: . . . . . . . . . .`? No, previous board row 6: `. . . . . . . . . .`. Wait, previous board row 6: `6 . . . . . . . . . .`. Previous board row 5: `5 . . . . . . . . A .`. Previous board row 4: `4 T T T . . . . . . A`. Previous board row 3: `3 T . . . . . . . . .`. Previous board row 2: `2 0 . . . . . . . . .`. Previous board row 1: `1 A . . . . . . . . .`. Previous board row 0: `0 . . A . . . . . . .`.\n    *   Ah, I see. In the *previous* turn's board (Turn 23), there was NO apple at (0,6). The 'A' mentioned in the rationale \"Apples at: (2, 0), (8, 5), (0, 1), (9, 4), (4, 9)\" and the board shows (0,1) and (2,0) etc. There is no (0,6) apple in the list.\n    *   *Correction on my previous turn's rationale:* I incorrectly identified (0,6) as an apple. It was empty. I moved DOWN into an empty space. This means I did not grow. My tail moved.\n    *   Current Head: (0, 6).\n    *   Current Body: (0,7) -> (4,6).\n    *   The spot below me is (0,5). Is it safe? The tail (4,6) moved to (3,6) or (4,5)? No, the tail is the last element. With 8 segments (Head + 7 body parts), the segment in front of the tail is (4,6)? No, the body list is: (0,7), (0,8), (1,8), (2,8), (3,8), (3,7), (3,6), (4,6). The tail is (4,6). When I move from (0,6) to (0,5), the tail (4,6) moves to (3,6)? No, the segment (4,6) is the tail. The segment before it is (3,6). When I move, (3,6) becomes the new tail? No, the whole body shifts. The new tail is the segment that was previously at index 7 (currently (4,6))? No, wait. The snake has length 9 (1 head + 8 body parts). The tail is at (4,6). The segment before the tail is (3,6).\n    *   If I move to (0,5), the body becomes: (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), ... (3,6). The tail was (4,6). It moves to (3,6). The old (3,6) moves to (3,7). etc.\n    *   Is (0,5) occupied by my body? Let's trace:\n        *   Head moves to (0,5).\n        *   Old Head (0,6) becomes new segment.\n        *   Old (0,7) shifts.\n        *   ...\n        *   Old (3,6) shifts to (3,7).\n        *   Old (3,7) shifts to (3,8).\n        *   Old (3,8) shifts to (2,8).\n        *   ...\n        *   Old (4,6) disappears.\n    *   Is (0,5) part of my current body? No. (0,6) is head. (0,7) is next. (0,8) is next. No overlap.\n    *   So DOWN to (0,5) is structurally safe (body mechanics).\n\n**2. Collision & Safety Check:**\n*   **My Body:** Moving DOWN to (0,5) is safe. I am not moving into myself.\n*   **Enemy:** Snake #0 Head at (0, 2). Body: (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), (2,4).\n    *   Enemy is moving. Distance to me is 3 units (0,2 to 0,5). They can potentially reach (0,3), (0,4), (0,5) depending on moves. If they move DOWN, they hit the wall (y=-1). If they move UP, they hit my body? No, my body is at (0,6) and up. If they move UP to (0,3), they are safe (body at 0,4). If they move UP to (0,4), they hit their own body (at 0,4).\n    *   Wait, the enemy body is at (0,3) and (0,4). If the enemy head (0,2) moves UP to (0,3), it hits its own body. If it moves UP to (0,4), it hits body at (0,4).\n    *   So the enemy is effectively trapped in the left column or must move RIGHT (1,2).\n    *   If they move RIGHT to (1,2), they are safe.\n    *   Can they reach me? To reach (0,5) in one turn, they would need to move 3 steps up. Impossible.\n    *   However, \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies\". This doesn't hurt me, but I want to survive.\n    *   The danger is a head-on collision. To collide with me at (0,5), they would need to be at (0,6) (impossible, I am there), (1,5), (0,4), (-1,5). None of these are their current head.\n    *   So, moving to (0,5) avoids immediate death by collision.\n\n**3. Apple Strategy:**\n*   Apples: (0,1) is 4 units below me (0,5). (0,5) is not an apple.\n*   Wait, looking at the board state in *this* prompt: Row 1 has 'A' at (0,1). Row 0 has '.' at (0,0).\n*   Is there an apple at (0,5)? No.\n*   Is there an apple at (0,4)? No.\n*   Is there an apple at (0,3)? No.\n*   Is there an apple at (0,2)? No (Enemy head is there).\n*   So the closest apple in the left column is (0,1).\n*   I am currently at (0,6). To get to (0,1), I must go DOWN.\n*   Is (0,5) safe from my own tail?\n    *   My tail is at (4,6). The gap is at (0,5). It is definitely safe.\n*   Is there any reason not to go DOWN?\n    *   If I go DOWN, I get closer to (0,1).\n    *   If I go RIGHT (1,6), I go away from the apple. (1,6) is currently empty (board shows row 6 col 1 is `.`). But if I go RIGHT, I waste a turn and might get cut off by the enemy if they move right and then up.\n    *   If I go UP (0,7), I hit my body (0,7).\n    *   If I go LEFT, I hit the wall.\n*   So DOWN is the only valid move that progresses towards the objective.\n\n**4. Long-term Plan:**\n*   Continue descending the left column.\n*   Watch out for the enemy at (0,2). They are trapped (up blocked by body, down by wall, left by wall). They MUST move RIGHT to (1,2) or die.\n*   If they move RIGHT, they open up the left column. I can then move down to (0,1) and eventually (0,0) or eat (0,1) and turn around.\n*   I need to ensure I don't get trapped behind them. Since I am at (0,6) and they are at (0,2), there is significant distance. If they move right, I have the column to myself.\n*   **Objective:** Eat (0,1).\n\n**5. Final Decision:**\nMove **DOWN**.\n**END RATIONALE**\nDOWN",

The tail is at (4, 6).\n*   **Enemy Status:** Snake #0 is at (0, 2) with body segments at (0, 3) and (0, 4). They are confined to the left column and *must* move right (1, 2) to survive, as moving up hits their own body and moving down goes off-board. This clears the path for me in the column.\n*   **Objective:** There is an apple at (0, 1). The nearest accessible apple is at (0, 1) (down 5 units) or (2, 0) (diagonal).\n*   **Board State Check:**\n    *   (0, 6) -> Current Head.\n    *   (0, 5) -> Empty. Moving here is safe from my body (next segment is (0, 7)). It is also safe from the enemy (distance is 3 units).\n    *   (1, 6) -> Empty. Safe, but moves me away from the (0, 1) apple and could lead to tighter spaces later.\n\n**2. Collision & Safety Check:**\n*   **UP (0, 7):** Blocked by own body.\n*   **LEFT (-1, 6):** Out of bounds.\n*   **RIGHT (1, 6):** Safe. The enemy is at (0, 2) and moving right to (1, 2). They will be at (1, 2). I would be at (1, 6). There is no collision risk. However, this moves me away from the apple at (0, 1).\n*   **DOWN (0, 5):** Safe.\n    *   **Body:** My tail is at (4, 6). I will grow? No, I am not eating an apple (I verified (0, 5) is empty). When I move to (0, 5), my body shifts. The cell (0, 5) is currently empty. The cell (0, 6) becomes the neck. The cell (0, 7) remains body. The tail moves from (4, 6) to (3, 6) (since the segment at (3, 6) becomes the new tail). There is no self-collision.\n    *   **Enemy:** The enemy at (0, 2) is moving to (1, 2). They cannot reach (0, 5) in one turn. No head-on collision.\n\n**3. Strategy & Move Selection:**\n*   The goal is to collect apples efficiently while staying alive.\n*   Moving **DOWN** advances me towards the apple at (0, 1) and eventually (2, 0). \n*   Moving RIGHT is safe but reduces progress towards the closest apple.\n*   Since DOWN is safe and progressive, it is the optimal move.\n\n**START RATIONALE**\nDOWN",
