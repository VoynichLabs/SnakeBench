No apple there.\n\nSo I can only go LEFT or RIGHT.\n\nLet me think about which is better:\n\n**LEFT (7, 0):**\n- Safe move\n- Gets me closer to the cluster of apples: (4, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0) along the bottom row\n- Also closer to apples at (5, 3), (7, 3), (6, 4)\n- Opens up more of the board\n\n**RIGHT (9, 0):**\n- Safe move\n- Takes me to the corner (9, 0)\n- From there I can only go UP or LEFT (can't go right off board or down off board)\n- More limiting, could get trapped\n\nThe enemy snake at (2, 8) is in the top-left area.

Start moving toward the apples along the bottom: (4, 0), (2, 0), (1, 0) - that's 3 apples!\n3. Keep options open for future moves\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n1. Move LEFT now to (7, 0)\n2.

DEADLY.\n\nSo I can only go UP or LEFT safely.\n\n**LEFT (2, 0):**\n- Safe move with an APPLE!\n- Continues my bottom row apple collection strategy\n- Next: LEFT to (1, 0) for another apple!\n- Then: UP to (1, 1) for yet another apple!\n- Excellent path for collecting apples quickly\n\n**UP (3, 1):**\n- Safe move\n- No apple\n- Opens path toward other apples but abandons efficient bottom row strategy\n- Would need more moves to reach apples\n\nEnemy snake analysis:\n- Head at (4, 5), far from me\n- They might go UP to (4, 6), RIGHT to (5, 5), LEFT would hit their body, DOWN to (4, 4)\n- They're likely targeting apples near them like (6, 4), (5, 3), or (7, 5)\n- They're far from my bottom row path - no collision risk\n\nLet me trace my planned path:\n- Current: (3, 0)\n- LEFT to (2, 0) - APPLE! \u2190 this turn\n- LEFT to (1, 0) - APPLE!\n- UP to (1, 1) - APPLE!\n- This gives me 3 more apples, bringing me to 6 total, tying with enemy!\n\nAfter eating the apple at (2, 0), my snake will grow:\n- Head at (2, 0), body at [(3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)]\n\nThe bottom row strategy is still excellent - I can collect apples efficiently with no enemy interference.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: LEFT to (2, 0) - collect apple! (Score: 4)\n2. Next: LEFT to (1, 0) - collect apple! (Score: 5)\n3. UP to (1, 1) - collect apple! (Score: 6)\n4. UP to (1, 2) - safe\n5. Then toward (2, 3), (2, 4) cluster or (2, 1)\n\nWait, let me double-check (2, 1) - there's an apple there too! So after (1, 1), I could go RIGHT to (2, 1) for another apple!\n\nLEFT",

This would give me a point and tie the score.\n\n2. **DOWN** (2, 1): This is where my own body is! DEADLY.\n\n3. **LEFT** (1, 2): Empty space, safe move.

This turn: UP to (2, 3) - collect apple! (Score: 8)\n2. Next: UP to (2, 4) - collect apple! (Score: 9)\n3. Then: RIGHT to (3, 4) - collect apple! (Score: 10)\n4.

I collect an apple immediately (score: 10, taking the lead!)\n2. From (3, 4), I can go DOWN to (3, 3) or RIGHT to (4, 4)\n3. Then I can work toward (3, 2) apple or other apples\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: RIGHT to (3, 4) - collect apple! (Score: 10)\n2. Next: DOWN to (3, 3) - safe, getting toward (3, 2) apple\n3. Then: DOWN to (3, 2) - collect apple! (Score: 11)\n4. Continue collecting apples in the area or move toward other clusters\n\nThe (3, 4) apple is immediate and gives me the lead. After that, (3, 2) is nearby. Need to watch enemy snake movement - they're currently to my right and might expand toward the middle.\n\nRIGHT",

DEADLY\n  - DOWN to (4, 3) - where enemy head currently is\n  - LEFT to (3, 4) - my body will be there! DEADLY\n  - RIGHT to (5, 4) - safe\n\nEnemy snake analysis:\n- Head at (4, 3), body going right [(5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5), (6, 5), (5, 5), (4, 5), (3, 5)]\n- Enemy options: UP to (4, 4), DOWN to (4, 2), LEFT to (3, 3), RIGHT to (5, 3) is body\n- So enemy can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT\n\n**Collision risks:**\n- If I go RIGHT to (4, 4) and enemy goes UP to (4, 4) - HEAD-ON COLLISION! Both die!\n- If I go DOWN to (3, 3) and enemy goes LEFT to (3, 3) - HEAD-ON COLLISION! Both die!\n\nThis is tricky. Both my safe moves have potential head-on collision risks.\n\nLet me think about what enemy is likely to do:\n- Enemy might go UP toward (4, 6) apple area or the cluster at top\n- Enemy might go DOWN toward (8, 3) apple or (3, 2) apple\n- Enemy going LEFT toward (3, 2) apple is possible\n\nThe (3, 2) apple is 2 moves away from both of us. If I go DOWN now, I'd be at (3, 3) and could get (3, 2) next turn. Enemy going LEFT to (3, 3) would create collision.\n\nHowever, looking at apple positions, going UP seems more valuable for enemy (cluster of apples at top). Going DOWN toward (3, 2) is possible but risky for enemy since they'd be heading toward my territory.\n\nI'll take the calculated risk and go DOWN toward (3, 3), positioning myself to get the (3, 2) apple. If enemy goes UP (more likely for the apple cluster), I'm safe. If enemy goes LEFT, we both die but I'm ahead by 1 apple so I'd win.\n\nActually, checking the rules: \"If all snakes die on the same turn for any reason, the game ends immediately and the snake with more apples at that moment wins\"\n\nSo if we both die in head-on collision, I win with 10 vs 9!\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: DOWN to (3, 3)\n2. Next: DOWN to (3, 2) - collect apple! (Score: 11)\n3. Continue toward other apples\n\nDOWN",

Position (4, 2) is part of enemy snake body (they have (4, 2) in their body list). DEADLY.\n\n2. **DOWN** (4, 0): Looking at the board, this appears empty ('.'). Safe!\n\n3. **LEFT** (3, 1): This is where my own body is (first segment after head). DEADLY - moving backwards.\n\n4. **RIGHT** (5, 1): Looking at the board at position (5, 1), it appears empty ('.'). Safe!\n\nSo I have two safe options: DOWN to (4, 0) or RIGHT to (5, 1).\n\nLet me think about the enemy:\n- Enemy head at (7, 2)\n- From (7, 2), enemy options:\n  - UP to (7, 3) - their own body! DEADLY\n  - DOWN to (7, 1) - appears safe\n  - LEFT to (6, 2) - their own body! DEADLY\n  - RIGHT to (8, 2) - appears safe\n\nEnemy will likely go DOWN to (7, 1) toward apple at (8, 1), or RIGHT to (8, 2) toward apple at (8, 3).\n\n**Evaluating my options:**\n\n**DOWN (4, 0):** Safe, but moves me away from apples. The closest apple from there would still be (8, 1).\n\n**RIGHT (5, 1):** Safe, moves me toward the apple at (8, 1). From (5, 1), I could continue RIGHT to (6, 1), then (7, 1), then (8, 1) for the apple.\n\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (7, 1), and I'm heading toward (8, 1), we could both end up competing for that apple. But I'm at (4, 1) now - it would take me 4 moves to get there. Enemy is at (7, 2) and would reach (7, 1) in 1 move, then (8, 1) in 2 moves total.\n\nActually, if enemy goes to (7, 1) this turn and I go RIGHT to (5, 1), then:\n- Turn 21: Me at (5, 1), Enemy at (7, 1)\n- Turn 22: If I go RIGHT to (6, 1), enemy could be at (8, 1) eating the apple\n\nSo enemy might beat me to that apple. But RIGHT still seems better because:\n1. It keeps me moving toward apples\n2. DOWN to (4, 0) puts me in a more cramped position\n\nLet me check follow-up moves from each:\n- From (4, 0): UP would hit my tail at (2, 0)? No, (4, 0) is different. Options: UP to (4, 1) - now my tail, LEFT to (3, 0) - empty, RIGHT to (5, 0) - empty, DOWN - off board.\n- From (5, 1): UP to (5, 2) - enemy body! DOWN to (5, 0) - safe, LEFT to (4, 1) - my old head/now tail, RIGHT to (6, 1) - safe.\n\nRIGHT gives me a clear path toward apples and keeps options open.\n\n**Strategy:**\nContinue RIGHT toward apples. If (8, 1) is taken by enemy, pivot up toward (8, 3) or (8, 6). The top region has many apples too.\n\nRIGHT",

DEADLY.\n\n2. **DOWN** (6, 0): Looking at the board, this appears empty ('.'). Safe!\n\n3. **LEFT** (5, 1): This is where my own body is (first segment after head). DEADLY - moving backwards.\n\n4. **RIGHT** (7, 1): Looking at the board at position (7, 1), it appears empty ('.'). Safe! And this moves me toward the apple at (8, 1).\n\nSo I have two safe options: DOWN to (6, 0) or RIGHT to (7, 1).\n\nLet me think about the enemy:\n- Enemy head at (8, 3)\n- From (8, 3), enemy options:\n  - UP to (8, 4) - appears safe\n  - DOWN to (8, 2) - their own body! DEADLY\n  - LEFT to (7, 3) - their own body at (7, 3)! DEADLY\n  - RIGHT to (9, 3) - appears safe\n\nSo enemy can go UP or RIGHT. They might go UP toward the apples at (8, 6), (9, 8), etc.\n\n**Evaluating my options:**\n\n**DOWN (6, 0):** Safe, moves me toward corner. From there I could go LEFT to (5, 0) or RIGHT to (7, 0). Limited options.\n\n**RIGHT (7, 1):** Safe, moves me closer to the apple at (8, 1)! From (7, 1), I can then go RIGHT to (8, 1) to get the apple. This is very appealing.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 1) this turn:\n- Next turn from (7, 1): UP to (7, 2) - enemy body there? Let me check... (7, 2) has 'T' on board. Actually wait, looking at enemy body list: [(8, 2), (7, 2), ...] - yes (7, 2) is enemy body. So UP would be dangerous (but enemy will move, so the tail might clear).\n- RIGHT to (8, 1) - there's an apple! Great option.\n- DOWN to (7, 0) - safe, empty.\n- LEFT to (6, 1) - my own body by then.\n\n**Strategy decision:**\nRIGHT to (7, 1) is clearly better because:\n1. It puts me one step away from the apple at (8, 1)\n2. Next turn I can grab that apple\n3. After that, I can navigate upward toward more apples\n\nThe enemy is at (8, 3) and likely heading UP toward (8, 4) and then toward the cluster of apples up there. We're on different paths right now.\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n- This turn: RIGHT to (7, 1)\n- Next turn: RIGHT to (8, 1) to grab the apple\n- Then: Navigate up toward (8, 6), (6, 4), or other apples while avoiding enemy\n\nRIGHT",

Looking at enemy body list: [..., (8, 2), ...]. DEADLY.\n\n2. **DOWN** (8, 0): Looking at the board, this appears empty ('.'). Safe!\n\n3. **LEFT** (7, 1): This is where my own body is (first segment after head). DEADLY - moving backwards into myself.\n\n4. **RIGHT** (9, 1): Looking at the board, this appears empty ('.'). Safe!\n\nSo I have two safe options: DOWN to (8, 0) or RIGHT to (9, 1).\n\nLet me think about the enemy:\n- Enemy head at (8, 5)\n- From (8, 5), enemy will likely go UP to (8, 6) to grab that apple, or LEFT to (7, 5)\n\n**Evaluating my options:**\n\n**DOWN (8, 0):** Safe. From there I could go:\n- LEFT to (7, 0) - safe\n- RIGHT to (9, 0) - safe\n- UP to (8, 1) would be my own body by then\n\n**RIGHT (9, 1):** Safe. From there I could go:\n- UP to (9, 2) - appears safe\n- DOWN to (9, 0) - safe\n- LEFT to (8, 1) would be my own body by then\n\nLooking at apple positions:\n- (0, 0) is far away in opposite corner\n- Most apples are in the upper portion of the board: (6, 4), (8, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (7, 7), (9, 8), etc.\n\nI need to eventually get to the upper part of the board where most apples are. \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (9, 1), I can then go UP (9, 2), UP (9, 3), UP (9, 4), etc. to reach (9, 8) apple.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 0), I'm moving further from apples but could go RIGHT to (9, 0), then navigate up.\n\nThe enemy is at (8, 5) and will likely take (8, 6). If I go RIGHT to (9, 1) and then head up the right edge, I can reach (9, 8) and have a clear path.\n\nLet me verify RIGHT (9, 1) is definitely safe:\n- Not off board (9 is valid)\n- Not my body\n- Not enemy body - enemy body is at (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), etc. - (9, 1) is not in enemy body\n\nRIGHT seems like the better strategic choice - it positions me to go up the right side toward (9, 8).\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- This turn: RIGHT to (9, 1)\n- Next: UP to (9, 2) if safe\n- Continue going UP along right edge toward (9, 8) apple\n- My tail will clear spaces as I move, opening more paths\n\nRIGHT",

Looking at the board:\n- Enemy head '1' is at position (8, 7) based on the board display\n- (9, 7) appears empty\n\nIf enemy goes to (9, 7), I'd need to find another route.

T T T .` - position (9, 7) shows `.` which is empty. But wait, enemy body includes (8, 7), (7, 7)... Let me verify (9, 7) - that appears to be empty. Safe!\n\n2. **DOWN** (9, 5): This is where my own body segment is. DEADLY!\n\n3. **LEFT** (8, 6): Looking at the board row 6: `. A A . A . . . T 0` - position (8, 6) shows `T` which is enemy body. DEADLY!\n\n4. **RIGHT** (10, 6): Off the board! DEADLY!\n\nSo I only have ONE safe option: **UP** to (9, 7).\n\nLet me verify by looking at the board display more carefully:\n```\nRow 7: A A . . . . T T T .\n       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\nPosition (9, 7) is the last `.` - it's empty! Safe.\n\n**Path planning from (9, 7):**\n- (9, 7) \u2192 (9, 8) for apple at (9, 8) - that's next turn!\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\n- Enemy head is at (6, 9)\n- They could go UP - off board at (6, 10) - DEADLY for them\n- They could go LEFT to (5, 9) - there's an apple there!\n- They could go DOWN to (6, 8) - their own body is there - DEADLY\n- They could go RIGHT to (7, 9) - empty, safe\n\nSo enemy will likely go LEFT to (5, 9) to grab that apple, putting them at 15.\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n1. This turn: UP to (9, 7) - only safe option\n2. Next turn: UP to (9, 8) for the apple - I'll be at 13\n3.

There's also an apple cluster on the left: (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 6), (2, 6), (4, 6)\n\nThe enemy is ahead and collecting apples in the top-left area. After getting (9, 8), I need to efficiently navigate to remaining apples. The left side has many apples that might be harder for the enemy to reach quickly given their position.\n\n**Future self note:**\n- After (9, 8), go UP to (9, 9) then LEFT along row 9 if safe, or go LEFT from (9, 8) along row 8\n- Watch for enemy position - they're likely heading toward (3, 9), (1, 9) area\n- Bottom left has apples at (0, 0), (0, 1), (6, 0) - consider later\n\nUP",

A . A 1 T T . . .` - position (9, 9) is `.` - empty and safe!\n\n2. **DOWN** (9, 7): This is where my own body segment is. DEADLY!\n\n3. **LEFT** (8, 8): Looking at row 8: `. A . A . . T . . 0` - position (8, 8) is `.` - empty and safe!\n\n4. **RIGHT** (10, 8): Off the board! DEADLY!\n\nSo I have TWO safe options: UP to (9, 9) or LEFT to (8, 8).\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\n- Enemy head is at (4, 9)\n- They could go LEFT to (3, 9) - there's an apple there!\n- They could go DOWN to (4, 8) - empty\n- They could go RIGHT to (5, 9) - their own body - DEADLY\n- They could go UP - off board at (4, 10) - DEADLY\n\nEnemy will likely go LEFT to (3, 9) to grab that apple!\n\n**Evaluating my options:**\n\n**UP (9, 9):**\n- Safe, no apple\n- From (9, 9), next moves: LEFT to (8, 9) - empty, DOWN to (9, 8) - my body, others off board or body\n- Limited options, but I can sweep left along top row\n\n**LEFT (8, 8):**\n- Safe, no apple\n- From (8, 8), next moves: UP to (8, 9) - empty, LEFT to (7, 8) - empty, DOWN to (8, 7) - enemy body (T)\n- More flexibility\n\nBoth options seem reasonable. Let me think about apple access:\n- Apples on row 9: (1, 9), (3, 9) - enemy likely going for (3, 9)\n- Apples on row 8: (1, 8), (3, 8)\n- Apple at (5, 7) is nearby\n\nIf I go UP to (9, 9), I can then go LEFT repeatedly to reach apples at (3, 9) or (1, 9).\nIf I go LEFT to (8, 8), I can continue left and potentially cut down to (5, 7).\n\nThe enemy is heading toward the left side apples. I should try to compete for them or find alternative routes.\n\nGoing UP keeps me on the top row with a clear path left. Going LEFT gives me more vertical flexibility.\n\nActually, looking at the board, going UP then sweeping LEFT along row 9 seems like a good plan to collect apples at (1, 9) while the enemy may take (3, 9).\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n1. This turn: UP to (9, 9)\n2. Next: LEFT repeatedly along row 9\n3. Target apples: (1, 9), (1, 8), (0, 7), (1, 7)\n4. The left column has many apples clustered\n\nGoing UP gives me a clear path to sweep west.\n\nUP",

DEADLY!\n\n2. **DOWN** (8, 8): Looking at the board - row 8, column 8 shows `.` - but wait, let me check the enemy body. Enemy body includes (8, 7) but not (8, 8). Looking at the board state for row 8: `. A . A . . T . . T` - position (8, 8) is `.` - empty and safe!\n\n3. **LEFT** (7, 9): Looking at row 9: `. A 1 T T T T . 0 T` - position (7, 9) is `.` - empty and safe!\n\n4. **RIGHT** (9, 9): This is my own body segment at (9, 9). DEADLY!\n\nSo I have TWO safe options: **DOWN** to (8, 8) or **LEFT** to (7, 9).\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\n- Enemy head is at (2, 9)\n- Enemy could go:\n  - LEFT to (1, 9) - there's an apple at (1, 9)!\n  - DOWN to (2, 8) - empty\n  - UP to (2, 10) - off board\n  - RIGHT to (3, 9) - their own body\n\nEnemy will likely go LEFT to (1, 9) to grab that apple.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- If I go LEFT to (7, 9), I continue along the top row toward the apples on the left side.\n- If I go DOWN to (8, 8), I start moving down but there aren't many apples in that direction.\n\nThe apples are concentrated on the left side: (1, 9), (1, 8), (3, 8), (0, 7), (1, 7), (4, 6), (1, 6), (2, 6), (5, 7)\n\nGoing LEFT keeps me moving toward the apple cluster. From (7, 9), I can continue left toward (5, 7) apple and the others.\n\nLet me trace ahead:\n- From (7, 9): Can go LEFT to (6, 9) - but wait, that's enemy body (T). Actually looking at row 9: positions 3-6 are enemy (1 and T's). So (6, 9) is T - enemy body!\n\nWait, let me re-read: Row 9 is `. A 1 T T T T . 0 T` which means:\n- (0,9)=., (1,9)=A, (2,9)=1(enemy head), (3,9)=T, (4,9)=T, (5,9)=T, (6,9)=T, (7,9)=., (8,9)=0(my head), (9,9)=T(my body)\n\nSo from (7, 9), next turn I could go:\n- LEFT to (6, 9) - enemy body! BLOCKED\n- DOWN to (7, 8) - need to check... row 8 has T at position 6. (7, 8) appears empty.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (7, 9), I'll be blocked by enemy body from continuing left!\n\nIf I go DOWN to (8, 8), I have more room. From (8, 8) I can go:\n- LEFT to (7, 8) - empty\n- DOWN to (8, 7) - that's enemy body (8, 7)\n\nHmm, both directions have issues. But DOWN to (8, 8) then LEFT to (7, 8) seems viable to get around the enemy.\n\n**Decision:** DOWN to (8, 8) gives me a path around the enemy snake toward the apples.\n\nDOWN",

DEADLY!\n\n2. **DOWN** (8, 7): Looking at the board, row 7 shows `A A . . . A T T T T`. Position (8, 7) has a T - that's enemy snake body! DEADLY!\n\n3. **LEFT** (7, 8): Looking at row 8: `. A . A . . T . 0 T`. Position (7, 8) shows `.` - empty and safe!\n\n4. **RIGHT** (9, 8): This is my own body at (9, 8). DEADLY!\n\nSo I only have ONE safe option: **LEFT** to (7, 8).\n\nLet me verify by checking enemy positions:\nEnemy body includes: (2, 9), (3, 9), (4, 9), (5, 9), (6, 9), (6, 8), (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), (8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2)\n\nYes, (8, 7) is enemy body, (7, 7) is enemy body too. So from (7, 8), next turn:\n- UP to (7, 9) - empty\n- DOWN to (7, 7) - enemy body, blocked\n- LEFT to (6, 8) - enemy body, blocked\n- RIGHT to (8, 8) - my old body (but tail might move)\n\nHmm, this is a tight spot. Let me think about where the enemy is going. Enemy head at (1, 9) can go:\n- LEFT to (0, 9) - empty\n- DOWN to (1, 8) - there's an apple there!\n- UP - off board\n- RIGHT to (2, 9) - own body\n\nEnemy will likely go DOWN to (1, 8) to grab that apple.\n\n**Strategic note for future:**\nI'm in a tricky position. Going LEFT to (7, 8) is my only option. From there, I need to go UP to (7, 9) next turn (since DOWN and LEFT are blocked by enemy). Then I can continue LEFT along the top, but the enemy snake blocks (6, 9) and beyond. \n\nThe apples I should target are: (5, 7) is nearby, and the cluster at (1, 6), (2, 6), (4, 6), (1, 7), (0, 7), (1, 8), (3, 8).\n\nFrom (7, 8), if I go UP to (7, 9), then I could go LEFT but (6, 9) is enemy body. So I'd need to wait for enemy to move or go down through (7, 8) area once enemy clears.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. From (7, 8):\n- UP to (7, 9) is safe, then from (7, 9) I can only go DOWN back to (7, 8) or further left if enemy moves...\n\nThis is constrained. But LEFT to (7, 8) is my only choice right now.\n\nLEFT",

T T T T T T . T T`. Position (7, 9) shows `.` - empty and safe!\n\n2. **DOWN** (7, 7): Looking at row 7: `A A . . . A T T T T`. Position (7, 7) has a T - that's enemy snake body! DEADLY!\n\n3. **LEFT** (6, 8): Looking at row 8: `. 1 . A . . T 0 T T`. Position (6, 8) shows `T` - that's enemy snake body! DEADLY!\n\n4. **RIGHT** (8, 8): This is my own body at (8, 8).

DEADLY\n- DOWN to (7, 8): My old body, but tail will move, should be clear\n- LEFT to (6, 9): Currently enemy body at T... need to check if it clears\n- RIGHT to (8, 9): Currently my body at (8, 9)\n\nEnemy head at (1, 8) can go:\n- LEFT to (0, 8) - empty\n- DOWN to (1, 7) - there's an apple at (1, 7)!\n- UP to (1, 9) - that's own body\n- RIGHT to (2, 8) - empty\n\nEnemy will likely go DOWN to get the apple at (1, 7).\n\n**Strategic note for future:**\nI'm in a very constrained position. Going UP to (7, 9) is my only safe move. From there, I'll need to work my way left once enemy body clears, or go back down through (7, 8). The apple at (5, 7) is nearby. I need to find a way to break free from this corner and collect apples. The cluster at (1, 6), (2, 6), (4, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (3, 8) would be valuable targets once I can navigate there. I'm 5 apples behind so I need to be aggressive in collecting.\n\nMy tail is at (7, 1) and will move each turn since I'm not eating. So positions that are currently my body will gradually clear.\n\nUP",

If enemy eats an apple, body stays same length. If not, tail at (5, 2) clears.\n\nBut (6, 9) is near the enemy's head end, not tail end. It won't clear this turn.\n\nI'm in a very dangerous position. Let me verify once more:\n- DOWN to (7, 8): My body at (7, 8) - will this clear? No, (7, 8) is right behind my head, second segment. Only the tail (8, 1) clears.\n\nActually, I'm trapped. All four directions lead to death. In this case, I should pick the move that might give me a chance if the enemy also dies (head collision or similar).\n\nThe enemy head at (1, 7) could move to (0, 7) for an apple. No chance of head collision with me.\n\nSince I must make a move and all seem deadly, LEFT into enemy body at (6, 9) is just as bad as others. Let me pick DOWN - my tail moves so maybe... no wait, (7, 8) is my first body segment, not tail.\n\nI'll go LEFT since enemy body might also be moving and there's a tiny chance something shifts.\n\nLEFT",
