From (4,8), the enemy could move to (4,9), (4,7), (3,8), or (5,8); none of these put it near my possible positions this turn, but moving RIGHT takes me toward the enemy's general sector (x=3-4), which could set up distant risks if we both head center-right later. Moving UP ((2,3)) or LEFT ((1,2)) keeps me in the left-bottom quadrant, offering wider exploration without closing paths prematurely.\n\nAmong the safe moves, LEFT to (1,2) best balances safety and opportunity: it keeps three follow-up options open (UP, DOWN\u2014now allowed as the forbidden direction resets, or LEFT), avoids potential enemy interference by staying left, and aligns with exploring unpopulated areas while keeping paths open to loop back or head up toward apples like (5,6) at (5,6) (though that requires zigzagging right at some point). UP to (2,3) also keeps options (LEFT, RIGHT, UP) and positions me higher for central access, but it moves vertically into more open board center, where the enemy could converge faster. RIGHT to (3,2) keeps options (UP, RIGHT, DOWN allowing (3,1), which would be clear post-move) but edges me toward x=4 (enemy's x=4), potentially limiting retreat and risking future head-on or body collisions if the enemy descends; it's less flexible early-game since the right side has apples at (9,2)/(8,1), but those at y=1-2 feel distant without circling. Prioritizing moves that open escapes and avoid premature commitment, LEFT ranks highest for now\u2014simple, safe expansion leftward without overcommitting direction.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue left to skirt the board edge, gathering space and positioning for an eventual swing right-up toward the cluster at (5,6),(6,8),(7,9) while monitoring the enemy; if conflict looms (e.g., they move south), pivot to defensive looping in the left quadrants. Aim for consistent small grows without entrapment.\n\nLEFT",

It's safe from traps or enemy (currently top-right at 8,9, possibly moving west toward mid). However, it moves me away from all nearby apples (5,6 at manhattan ~6 steps right, 5-1 left; bottom at 7-9,1-2 even further via right/down pivot), prioritizing long-term positioning over immediate scoring.\n\nRIGHT shifts laterally mid-board at y=5, directly opening a short rightward path toward reachable apples like (5,6): from 1,5 to 5,5 (via ~4 more RIGHTs), then UP to eat. This keeps multiple escapes (UP/DOWN after), avoids dead-ends, and reduces distance to score faster. Enemy at 8,9 seems distant, unlikely to head-on soon (they might stay top-right or drop south), though RIGHT risks mid-board congestion if they zig toward me.\n\nDespite the prior plan to climb x=0, apples are urgent for a lead (tied 2-2).

The northern/western cluster ((4,8), (3,7), (1,7)) is priority over the southern ones, which the enemy (head at (7,1), leading with 7 apples) is better positioned to contest. LEFT advances me westward directly toward that cluster while keeping multiple options open (e.g., next moves from (6,7) could be UP to (6,8) for northbound progress or LEFT to (5,7) for continued west advance). This positions me closer to apples without crowding my body or heading east away from targets.\n\nRIGHT would move me eastward to (8,7), increasing distance from the main apple group, and while it avoids immediate traps, it limits my westward access and could force a future zigzag back. UP to (7,8) is safer but leaves me still at x=7\u2014nearer the north, I could then pivot left to (6,8) next turn, but LEFT gets me to x=6 faster, allowing a straighter approach to (3,7) or beyond without leaving extra eastward options exposed.\n\nOverall, LEFT keeps the most follow-up moves (up or left from (6,7), down to (6,6) is blocked by my body) while boosting my apple path.

From (6,8), zigzag RIGHT to (7,8) if empty/open, then potentially UP to (7,9) to access row 9's edge for southbound maneuvers while monitoring enemy (likely staying south); if row 8 congests or enemy pushes north, drop to row 7 or 6 via LEFT/DOWN zigzags toward apples (6,0 then north to (8,4)/(9,4)), keeping distance to avoid head-ons and favoring edges/corners for escape.\n\nRIGHT",

The apple at (3, 6) is the next closest, but moving toward (8, 4) and (9, 4) allows me to exploit the open space on the right side of the board while Snake #0 is occupied in the top-left/center quadrant.\n3.

It is not an immediate threat to your head, but its body blocks several paths in the y=7 to y=9 range.\n- **Apple Targets:**\n    - (3, 6) is only 2 moves away.\n    - (8, 4) and (9, 4) are 5+ moves away.\n    - (6, 5) is 4 moves away.\n- Right now, your body is effectively coiling in the bottom-left corner. You have plenty of space in the middle and right side of the board.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will move UP to target the apple at (3, 6). This keeps me in the center column and allows me to decide between going for the apples at (6, 5) or (8/9, 4) next. Moving UP also keeps me away from my own lower body at (3, 1) and provides more maneuverability than moving into the narrower spaces on the right immediately.\n\nUP",

No enemy body nearby; enemy head at (3,4) is well southwest.\n\nAmong safe moves (DOWN and RIGHT), both leave 2-3 follow-up options, but DOWN immediately moves toward apples like (6,5) and (6,0), opening southward paths with more zigzagging potential (LEFT/RIGHT at (6,7) etc.) while keeping distance from enemy clusters in southwest (rows 1-4, cols 0-3). RIGHT continues rightward along row 9, but LEFT backtracks are instantly blocked due to own body filling row 9 behind, limiting evasion. Enemy may pursue its nearby apples (8,4)/(9,4), creating head-on risks if it ventures north; DOWN reduces those odds by turning south early.\n\nLong-term plan: Descend down column 6 cautiously via DOWN moves to target (6,5) for apple intake (score 10), Monitoring enemy northward pushes; if clean, continue south to (6,0) or pivot LEFT toward (3,6).

Moves toward empty space above the body.\n2. **DOWN (4, 5):** **SAFE**. Moves toward the center.\n3. **LEFT (3, 6):** **DEATH**. This is your neck.\n4. **RIGHT (5, 6):** **CAUTION**. This move puts you adjacent to Snake #0's head (6, 6). A head-on collision at (6, 6) is not possible this turn as Snake #0 is already there, but if you both move to (5, 6), you both die.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n- Snake #0 at (6, 6) is very close. Its possible moves are (5, 6), (7, 6), or (6, 5).\n- If I move **RIGHT** to (5, 6) and Snake #0 moves **LEFT** to (5, 6), we both die.\n- If I move **DOWN** to (4, 5) and Snake #0 moves **DOWN** to (6, 5), I am well-positioned to either contest the lower apples or move toward (5, 1).\n- Moving **UP** to (4, 7) is safe but moves further away from the apples.\n- Snake #0 is likely targeting the apple at (6, 5). \n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will move DOWN to (4, 5). This avoids a potential head-on collision at (5, 6) if Snake #0 moves left. From (4, 5), I have a clear path to the apples at (5, 1) or (6, 5) depending on Snake #0's movement.

Enemy could counter-move RIGHT to same cell for head-on (bad, mutual death; enemy has more apples so loses overall). Keeps multiple options (e.g., up/left isolates).\nRIGHT (7,6): Safe, explores east, but no immediate apples, risks isolating into wall or own body loops, fewer follow-ups (downeast blocked by board edge).\nDOWN (6,5): Safe, immediately eats apple (gains +1 to 10, ties/enables overtaking enemy at 10 apples), keeps strong southward momentum on (6,0) with clear column 6 path (rows 5-0 empty except apples). Allows future pivots west/east; low enemy head-on risk (e.g., if enemy RIGHTs to (5,6) or DOWNs to (4,5), avoids collision).\n\nPrioritize eating reachable apple safely (DOWN directly). This builds lead while keeping open escapes/pivots; avoids traps like head-on LEFT-RIGHT.\n\nLong-term strategy: After eating at (6,5), continue south in column 6 to collect (6,0) for +1 more (to 11), then pivot west/left to (5,1) for next apple (+1 to 12), then east toward clustered apples at (8,4)/(9,4) if safe, aiming to out-eat enemy while avoiding pursuit into dead ends.

You would be adjacent to Snake #0's head at (6, 4). If Snake #0 moves LEFT to (5, 4), there is a head-on collision.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nSnake #0 is at (6, 4). It is very close to the apples at (8, 4) and (9, 4). It is unlikely to move left toward you unless it's trying to force a collision or block your path. It is more likely to move RIGHT to (7, 4) or DOWN to (6, 3).\n\nMove **DOWN** (4, 3) is the safest option. It maintains a two-tile cushion between your head and Snake #0's head, avoiding any immediate collision risk. It also points you directly toward the open lower-right quadrant where apples at (5, 1) and (6, 0) are located.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nI will move **DOWN** to (4, 3). This creates distance from Snake #0 and positions me to sweep south for the apples at (5, 1) and (6, 0). My body is currently coiled in the (3, 4) to (4, 6) area; moving south allows that coil to unravel and gives me more maneuverability in the center-left. Once I secure the lower apples, I can evaluate if I can challenge Snake #0 for the apples at (8, 4) or (9, 4).\n\nDOWN",

Body: [(6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8)].\n- **Apples:** (9, 4), (8, 4), (6, 0), (5, 1), (5, 6).\n\n**Move Evaluation for Head (4, 1):**\n1. **UP (4, 2):** **DEATH**. This is your neck.\n2. **DOWN (4, 0):** **SAFE**. Moves toward empty space along the bottom edge.\n3. **LEFT (3, 1):** **SAFE**. Moves away from Snake #0 toward empty space on the left.\n4. **RIGHT (5, 1):** **DANGEROUS**. This is an apple. Snake #0 is at (6, 1). If Snake #0 moves LEFT to (5, 1), we collide head-on and both die. Since we are currently tied in score (10-10), a draw might be acceptable, but it's better to stay alive and try to win.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nThe apple at (5, 1) is contested. If I move RIGHT and Snake #0 moves LEFT, we both die. If I move RIGHT and Snake #0 moves DOWN to (6, 0), I get the apple at (5, 1) but become quite boxed in between his body and mine. \n\nHowever, looking at the board, Snake #0's tail is at (5, 8), and his body creates a vertical wall on the x=6 line. If I move DOWN to (4, 0), I can then swing around to (5, 0) and (6, 0). \n\nThe most conservative move to ensure survival while keeping eyes on the apples is **DOWN**. This prevents a head-on collision at (5, 1) if Snake #0 goes for it. If Snake #0 moves to (5, 1), I will be at (4, 0) and can then head towards (6, 0) or the left side. If Snake #0 moves to (6, 0), I can take (5, 1) on the next turn.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove **DOWN** to (4, 0). This eliminates the risk of a head-on collision at (5, 1). From (4, 0), I can react to Snake #0's movement: if he takes (5, 1), I go for (6, 0) or pull back to the left; if he goes for (6, 0), I take (5, 1) safely.\n\nDOWN",

This is your neck (backwards move).\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nYou are currently in the bottom-left corner area. Your body forms a vertical barrier at x=4 and a partial one at x=3. Snake #0 is currently positioned at (5, 3), effectively occupying the center. Note that Snake #0's body is very long and currently looping around itself.\n\nThe closest and safest apples for you are at (2, 7) and (0, 9). To reach them, you must travel north along the x=0, x=1, or x=2 columns. Moving UP to (1, 2) is the most efficient start for this journey.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nProceed UP along the left side of the board to collect apples at (2, 7) and (0, 9). Avoid merging back into the center where Snake #0 and your own tail segments (at x=4) are located. Keep an eye on Snake #0's head at (5, 3); it may try to cross into your path near y=6 or y=7. By staying near the left wall, you maintain maximum escape space.\n\nUP",

Moves toward the apple at (2, 7) and (0, 9).\n2. **DOWN (1, 3):** **DEATH**. This is your neck.\n3. **LEFT (0, 4):** **SAFE**. Moves toward the left wall.\n4. **RIGHT (2, 4):** **SAFE**. Direct path toward (2, 7). However, your body is currently clearing out of the (4, 0)-(4, 3) column, so there's plenty of space.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nThe apple at (2, 7) is the closest target (3 moves away). Snake #0 is at (5, 6) and is closer to the apples on the right side of the board. Since (2, 7) and (0, 9) are in your quadrant, moving UP is the most logical path to secure them. \n\nThe enemy snake is quite long (13 segments) and is currently clustered in the center-right. By moving UP and LEFT, you stay in open space while the tail of your body (currently at (4, 3)) moves forward, freeing up the center-right for you later if needed.\n\nMoving UP now puts you at (1, 5), followed by (2, 5) or (1, 6) to approach (2, 7).\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nProceed towards (2, 7) by moving UP. This path keeps you away from Snake #0's head and avoids any potential head-on collisions at this stage. Once (2, 7) is collected, pivot towards (0, 9).\n\nUP",

Other options: RIGHT to (5,7) is feasible but deviates from the path to (2,7) and doesn't bring the apple closer immediately. UP to (4,8) is safe but takes us higher, away from the y=7 apple cluster, reducing short-term apple acquisition chances and offering fewer follow-up options toward western targets (0,9) requires zigzagging down later, which traps us lower). No other safe moves (DOWN into own body at (4,6)). LEFT keeps multiple options: from (3,7), can continue LEFT to (2,7) next turn, rotate RIGHT/UP if enemy pursues, or evade via height. Avoiding head-on collisions by not preempting enemy paths yet\u2014enemy seems likely to LEFT/RIGHT/UHT from (1,9) to (9,2) or (2,7) rivalry.\n\nNext turns: After LEFT to (3,7), prioritize LEFT again to (2,7) and eat, then assess: if enemy blocks (1,7), go UP to (3,8) or RIGHT to (4,7) for space; otherwise, continue LEFT to (2,8) or turn UP to (2,8) for height and (0,9) radius.

If they move UP to (2, 9), they are still two columns away from you. \n- Moving UP to (0, 9) allows you to secure the apple and then evaluate whether to move DOWN the 0-column (which will be clear) or wait for Snake #0 to move elsewhere.\n- Since Snake #0 is currently blocking the path to the right, staying along the left wall is the safest immediate strategy.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove UP to (0, 9) to collect the apple. Following that, move DOWN toward (0, 7) and continue down the 0-column to reach the apple at (0, 1). This keeps you isolated from Snake #0's current position and utilizes the space being vacated by your own tail.\n\nUP",

Enemy's head at (0,8) could RIGHT to (1,8) or UP, creating indirect pressure, but avoids obvious head-ons while trapping my future into tighter spaces faster.\n\nFavor UP: best balances chasing (0,9) apple potential, open explore (row 9 advantages over row 8), and long-term survival/progress without undue trapping.

However, Snake #0's body is at (2, 8) and (2, 7), meaning they are currently constrained. If they move DOWN to (2, 8) or RIGHT to (3, 9), you are safe. \n- Unfortunately, you have no other legal moves as you are in the corner and your body blocks the DOWN path.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (1, 9). After this, the board will open up slightly as you move away from the corner. The goal is to avoid Snake #0 while navigating toward the apple at (0, 1) or the cluster on the right. Note that since Snake #0 is at (2, 9), a head-on collision at (1, 9) is a risk if they move LEFT, but you have no alternative choice.\n\nRIGHT",

Choosing LEFT risks suicide via head-on; RIGHT avoids that while keeping the game alive and heading towards the right-side apple cluster ((9,4), (8,4), (9,2), (9,8)) for future growth. Row 9 has open space (x=3-9 free), allowing LEFT/RIGHT pivots next turn without immediate traps. DOWN from (3,9) leads to empty (3,8), maintaining vertical options. Maintains 3-apples lead (14-11); enemy may struggle in left-congested areas. No closer safe apple rush feasible.\n\n### Long-Term Plan/Note to Future Self\nPrioritize navigating right to (4,9) then potentially down towards (9,8) or up-right towards higher y on right edge; avoid left to prevent enemy traps or collisions near x=0. If enemy dies or moves away, reclaim (0,1) later. Keep >1 move options, focus on eating right-cluster apples for 50-win.\n\nRIGHT",

This is currently occupied by Snake #0's body.\n2. **LEFT (0, 9):** **DEATH**. This is your neck/body.\n3. **UP (1, 10):** **DEATH**. Off the board.\n4. **DOWN (1, 8):** **DEATH**. This is your own body.\n\n**Wait, critical observation:**\nChecking the coordinates provided in the Board State and Body list carefully:\nHead: (1, 9). \nBody segments: (0, 9), (0, 8), (1, 8)...\nPossible moves from (1, 9):\n- (2, 9): Snake #0's body is at (2, 9). \n- (1, 8): Your body is at (1, 8).\n- (0, 9): Your body is at (0, 9).\n- (1, 10): Wall.\n\n*Correction:* Looking at the Snake #0 body list: `[(2, 9), (2, 8), (2, 7), ...]`. \nSince snakes move simultaneously, if Snake #0 moves, (2, 9) will become vacant (unless their tail was there, but it is their neck). However, their head is at (3, 9). If they move LEFT to (2, 9), I move RIGHT to (2, 9), we collide. If they move DOWN/RIGHT/UP, (2, 9) is occupied by their segment that was at (2, 9) last turn.\n\nActually, checking the board visualization:\nRow 9: `T 1 T 0 . . . . . .`\n(0,9) is your body (T), (1,9) is your head (1), (2,9) is enemy body (T), (3,9) is enemy head (0).\nYou are blocked on all sides by your own body, the enemy body, or the wall.\n\nWait, looking at the body list again: `(0,9)` is the segment after my head `(1,9)`. \nThe only way I am alive is if I just moved from (0,9) to (1,9). \nIs there any escape? \nIf Snake #0 moves their head (3, 9) somewhere else, (3, 9) becomes a potential spot for me later, but I must survive this turn. \nLooking at the coordinates again:\nCurrent Head (1, 9).\nRight: (2, 9) - Snake 0 Body.\nDown: (1, 8) - Your Body.\nLeft: (0, 9) - Your Body.\nUp: (1, 10) - Wall.\n\nIt appears I am trapped. However, if Snake #0's body at (2, 9) moves forward, that cell remains occupied by the segment at (3, 9) unless it also moves. Since (2, 9) is the segment specifically behind the head (3, 9) if we look at the list `[(2,9), (2,8)...]`, it's the neck. It will be occupied by the head or stay occupied by body. \n\nWait\u2014was my last move RIGHT? Yes. I moved from (0,9) to (1,9). \nThe only possible move is RIGHT and hope for a collision or an error in the segment tracking, as all other directions are certain death.\n\nRIGHT",

No safe moves; enemy dies this turn no matter what. If I survive, win immediately since opponents die. If both die, game ends with my lead intact.\n\n### Rationale for Choice\nSurface-level win possible via safe move (DOWN or RIGHT), ending game early. Prefer RIGHT to align with long-term plan of navigating right for open space and apple cluster ((9,4),(8,4),(9,2),(9,8)). From (4,9), flexible: RIGHT to open x=5-9 in row 9, or DOWN to (4,8) towards (9,8) apple. DOWN also safe but less aligned to right-focus strategy; enemy death unlocks full board regardless. Keeps multiple options (2).\n\n### Long-Term Plan/Note to Future Self\nEnemy guaranteed death; game ends via win condition after this move. If inexplicably survives (impossible per rules), continue rightward push: RIGHT to (5,9) or further, pivot down at (9,9) towards (9,8), then loop back for (9,4)/(8,4). Reclaim left if needed after victory.\n\nRIGHT",
