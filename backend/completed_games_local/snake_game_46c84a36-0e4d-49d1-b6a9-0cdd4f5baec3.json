However, the body segment at (8, 7) is currently blocking pathing further right until it moves.\n\n### Strategy and Rationale:\nThe goal is to capitalize on the proximity to multiple apples.\n- Apple (4, 5) is 3 steps away via (5, 6).\n- Apple (8, 6) is 4 steps away via (6, 7) or (5, 6) pathing.\n- Apple (8, 5) is also nearby.\n- The enemy is currently at (7, 1) and will likely target (8, 3).\n- Moving **DOWN** to (5, 6) is highly flexible. It allows me to pivot toward the apple at (4, 5) or continue toward the right-side cluster while maintaining distance from my own body segments at (8, 8) and (8, 7) which are slowly clearing out. This path keeps the middle of the board open.\n\n**Plan:** Move DOWN to (5, 6). From there, evaluate if (4, 5) or the (8, 5)/(8, 6) cluster is safer/closer depending on where the enemy moves.\n\nDOWN",

Safe. This puts me above the row of the apple at (0, 5) but keeps me away from the body segments at (4, 5) and (4, 6).\n2.  **DOWN**: Moves to (3, 4). Safe.

The apple at (1, 3) is also relatively close. Snake 1 is currently occupied on the right side of the board with three potential apples (8, 5), (8, 6), and (9, 1). \n\nMoving **LEFT** is the most efficient path to the nearest apple (0, 5). It continues the momentum from the previous turn and keeps my snake away from the clustered body segments currently moving through (4, 6) and (5, 6). Once I reach (0, 5), I will have a clear path to go down towards (1, 3) or maneuver back toward the center depending on where Snake 1 moves. \n\n**Plan:** Move LEFT to (2, 5). Then continue LEFT to (1, 5) and (0, 5) to collect the apple and widen the score lead.\n\nLEFT",

This also moves me closer to the apples at (5, 1) and (9, 1).\n\n### Strategy and Rationale:\n\nThe current priority is to maintain the lead by securing the closest apples. \n- Snake 1 is currently in the top-left quadrant (2, 8) and will likely target (2, 9) or move right/down toward (6, 6) or (8, 9).\n- Apple (5, 1) is very close to my head.\n- Apple (9, 1) is in the bottom right corner, relatively uncontested.\n- Apple (6, 6) is in the middle, but Snake 1 might reach it before me if I move there now.\n\n**Evaluating DOWN vs RIGHT:**\n- Moving **DOWN** to (4, 1) places my head one step away from the apple at (5, 1). From (4, 1), my next move can be RIGHT to (5, 1) to eat it.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (5, 2) also places me one step away from (5, 1). In this case, my next move would be DOWN to (5, 1).\n\nBoth are viable, but DOWN feels more direct toward the bottom cluster. I will move DOWN to (4, 1), then RIGHT to (5, 1). This keeps me far from Snake 1 and secures the apple quickly.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nCollect (5, 1), then head RIGHT for (9, 1). Monitor Snake 1's movements near (6, 6). If Snake 1 stays in the top region, I can potentially swing back up toward (6, 6) after clearing the bottom apples.\n\nDOWN",

However, this moves toward the center where my own body segments at y=3 and y=1 are nearby.\n4.  **RIGHT**: Moves to (10, 2). **Death** (Off-board).\n\n### Strategy and Rationale:\n\nThe current score is very close (11 to 10). I need to secure more apples while maintaining safety. Snake 1 is at (8, 9), very close to the apple at (8, 8). It is likely Snake 1 will move DOWN to (8, 8) this turn.\n\nMy snake is currently oriented vertically. Moving **UP** to (9, 3) is the safest choice. It maintains distance from my own body and the boundaries. It also positions me to eventually cut across the top or middle to reach apples at (6, 6) or (2, 6) once the body segments currently occupying the lower-middle area (x=4, y=1-3) move out of the way.\n\nStaying on the edge (column 9) prevents getting squeezed between my own body and the wall.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Move **UP** to (9, 3).\n2. Continue moving **UP** along the right wall to at least y=6 or y=7 to clear the horizontal body segments at y=1 and y=3.\n3. Once clear, pivot **LEFT** toward the clusters of apples in the upper and middle quadrants.\n\nUP",

This keeps me on the wall and moves me closer to the row containing apples at $Y=6$. \n2.  **DOWN**: Moves to (9, 4). **Death** (Backwards into body).\n3.  **LEFT**: Moves to (8, 5). **Potential Danger**. Snake 1 is at (8, 6). If they move DOWN to (8, 5), it's a head-on collision. Given they are at (8, 6), they are likely targeting the apple at (6, 6) or moving down.\n4.  **RIGHT**: Moves to (10, 5). **Death** (Off-board).\n\n### Strategy and Rationale:\n\nThe score is currently 11-11. My snake is currently positioned along the bottom and right edges. \n\nThe move **UP** to (9, 6) is the safest. It avoids any immediate head-on collision with Snake 1, who may move to (8, 5) or (7, 6) this turn. By reaching (9, 6), I am adjacent to Snake 1's head (if they move to 8, 6 or 9, 6), but since we move simultaneously, I will be safe at (9, 6) unless they also move to (9, 6), which would be a collision. However, Snake 1's likely path is toward the apples at (6, 6) or (2, 6).\n\nBy moving to (9, 6), I position myself to potentially cut across the board to the left on the next turn. My tail is currently at (4, 3) and moving away, which will eventually clear the center-bottom of the board for me to navigate.\n\n**Plan:** Move **UP** to (9, 6). Next turn, assess if it is safe to turn **LEFT** towards (6, 6) or if I should continue **UP** to pin Snake 1 against the top-right corner.\n\nUP",

RIGHT to (9,6) would hug the wall and leave me fewer follow-up options while not getting me closer to any apple. LEFT to (7,6) is safe, heads toward the (6,6) apple cluster, and keeps multiple exit options since the space around me is still quite open.\n\nPlan: take this apple cluster, then look to swing toward the center apples at (3,4) or (2,6) while staying away from Snake #0\u2019s corridor.\n\nLEFT",

LEFT carries me directly toward (2,6) and the central apples while keeping me away from Snake #0\u2019s patrol on the right, and I still have options to go DOWN afterward. Right is illegal because it hits my neck. So I\u2019ll go LEFT to stay on the apple track and keep open paths on both sides.\n\nPlan: Keep heading into the central apples with LEFT/DOWN weaving, staying clear of that tight right-side corridor and keeping space to escape if Snake #0 shifts.\n\nLEFT",
