The closest apple to you is at (6,7) (distance = sqrt((6-7)^2 + (7-4)^2) = sqrt(1 + 9) = sqrt(10) \u2248 3.16 units away). The next closest is (4,7) (distance \u2248 3.61).\n2. **Enemy Position:** Snake #0 is at (3,0), far from you. It has no body, so it\u2019s vulnerable if you can corner it.\n3. **No immediate threats:** Neither snake is long enough to block you yet, and there are no overlapping paths.\n4. **Apples are scattered:** You have multiple apples to target, but none are immediately adjacent to you.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Safe Moves**\nYour current head is at (7,4). Possible moves:\n1. **UP:** (7,5)\n2. **DOWN:** (7,3)\n3. **LEFT:** (6,4)\n4. **RIGHT:** (8,4)\n\n**Check for immediate death:**\n- **UP (7,5):** Safe (no snake body or apple here yet).\n- **DOWN (7,3):** Safe (no snake body or apple here yet).\n- **LEFT (6,4):** Safe (no snake body or apple here yet).\n- **RIGHT (8,4):** Safe (no snake body or apple here yet).\n\nNo move kills you immediately.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Apple Reachability**\nLet\u2019s prioritize moves that get you closer to apples while keeping flexibility.\n\n#### **Apple at (6,7):**\n- Distance from (7,4) to (6,7): (6-7, 7-4) = (-1, +3).\n- To reach this apple, you\u2019d need to move **LEFT** (to (6,4)) and then **UP** twice.\n- If you move **LEFT** now, you\u2019re one step closer to this apple.\n\n#### **Apple at (4,7):**\n- Distance from (7,4) to (4,7): (-3, +3).\n- To reach this, you\u2019d need to move **LEFT** twice and **UP** twice.\n- Moving **LEFT** now is part of the path.\n\n#### **Apple at (8,3):**\n- Distance from (7,4) to (8,3): (+1, -1).\n- Moving **RIGHT** or **DOWN** could help, but this apple is farther away and less urgent.\n\n#### **Apple at (2,8) or (3,8):**\n- These are far to the left and top. Not a priority yet.\n\n---\n### **Evaluating Future Flexibility**\n- Moving **LEFT** to (6,4) puts you closer to (6,7) and (4,7).\n- Moving **UP** to (7,5) or **DOWN** to (7,3) doesn\u2019t immediately help with apple reachability.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (8,4) is away from the apples you\u2019re targeting.\n\n**Best choice:** **LEFT** to (6,4), as it\u2019s the most direct step toward two apples and keeps your options open.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Considerations**\n- Snake #0 is at (3,0). It\u2019s far away, but if it moves **UP** or **RIGHT**, it could eventually threaten you.\n- Since it\u2019s short, you can outmaneuver it easily. No need to panic.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (for future self):**\n1. **Prioritize apples near (6,7) and (4,7)**. These are the closest and most accessible.\n2. **Avoid getting trapped in corners**. Keep your body short to avoid blocking yourself.\n3. **Watch Snake #0\u2019s movement**. If it starts moving toward you, adjust your path to avoid collisions.\n4. **If you grow longer, plan your path carefully** to avoid wrapping around the board or getting stuck.\n5. **If you see an enemy with no body, try to corner it** to eliminate it early.\n\n---\n### **Final Decision:**\n**LEFT** is the best move to get closer to apples while keeping flexibility.\n\n**LEFT**",

Now, you can move **LEFT** to (4, 8) or **DOWN** to (5, 7) (but (5, 7) is your body, so invalid).\n   - **RIGHT** to (6, 8) is safe (no snake body there yet).\n   - **UP** to (5, 9) is off the board (invalid).\n2. **Apples:**\n   - Closest apple to you is (3, 8) (distance = sqrt(4 + 1) \u2248 2.24 units diagonally up-left).\n   - Other apples are farther away: (8, 3), (2, 8), (6, 3).\n3. **Enemy:**\n   - Snake #0 is at (3, 6). It hasn\u2019t moved yet this turn, but its movement could threaten you if it starts moving toward you.\n4. **No immediate threats:** Snake #0 is not close enough to block you yet.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Safe Moves**\nPossible moves from (5, 8):\n1. **UP:** (5, 9) - **Invalid** (off the board).\n2. **DOWN:** (5, 7) - **Dangerous!** This is your own body (5, 7). Moving here would kill you.\n3. **LEFT:** (4, 8) - Safe.\n4. **RIGHT:** (6, 8) - Safe.\n\n**Eliminate unsafe moves:** Only **UP** and **DOWN** are invalid.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Apple Reachability**\n#### **Apple at (3, 8):**\n- Moving **LEFT** to (4, 8) is safe and closer to (3, 8). From there, you can move **LEFT** to (3, 8) next turn.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 8) is safe but doesn\u2019t help reach (3, 8) quickly. You\u2019d need to move **UP** or **DOWN** next to get closer, but those moves are off the board or into your body.\n\n#### **Apple at (6, 3):**\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 8) is safe but doesn\u2019t help reach (6, 3) quickly. You\u2019d need to move **DOWN** multiple times, but (5, 7) is your body, so you can\u2019t move down directly.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Future Flexibility**\n- Moving **LEFT** to (4, 8) is safe and positions you closer to (3, 8). It\u2019s a better intermediate step.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 8) is safe but doesn\u2019t help reach any apples quickly. It might be useful if Snake #0 starts moving toward you, but for now, it\u2019s not optimal.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Considerations**\n- Snake #0 is at (3, 6). If it moves **UP** to (3, 7) or **RIGHT** to (4, 6), it could eventually threaten you. For now, no immediate threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (for future self):**\n1. **Prioritize the apple at (3, 8)** because it\u2019s the closest reachable apple.\n2. **Move LEFT to (4, 8)** to position yourself closer to (3, 8). From there, you can move **LEFT** to (3, 8) next turn.\n3. **Watch Snake #0\u2019s movement**. If it starts moving toward you, adjust your path to avoid collisions.\n4. **Avoid getting trapped**. Since you\u2019re now length 3, ensure you don\u2019t move into your own body.\n5. **If Snake #0 starts moving aggressively**, consider moving toward it to eliminate it early.\n6. **After eating (3, 8)**, plan your next move toward the next closest apple, such as (2, 8) or (6, 3).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision:**\n**LEFT** is the best move to position yourself closer to the apple at (3, 8) while avoiding your tail and keeping future options open.\n\n**LEFT**",

Moving LEFT is the safest way to stay in the game and still maintain proximity to the western apples.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (2, 7) to avoid a potential head-on collision at (3, 8) or (4, 7).

This eats an apple. Snake 1 is at (3, 8). If Snake 1 moves LEFT, we have a head-on collision.

Safe, but moves away from immediate apple opportunities.\n3. **LEFT:** Moves to (1, 7). Safe.\n4. **RIGHT:** Moves to (3, 7). Safe, but puts me back where I was, potentially contested by Snake 1 if they move DOWN.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nSnake 1 is currently at (3, 8). If they move LEFT to (2, 8), they are taking that apple. If I move UP to (2, 8) at the same time, we both die. Since Snake 1 already has 2 apples (likely 3 now), I cannot afford a head-on collision as I have 0. \n\nHowever, looking at the board:\n- My (2, 8) goal is contested by their potential LEFT.\n- Their (4, 7) goal (where an apple is) is contested by my potential RIGHT then UP, or my current position.\n- Snake 1's body is currently at (4, 8) and (5, 8).\n\nIf I move UP to (2, 8), I risk the collision. If I move RIGHT to (3, 7), I am in a position to contest (4, 7) or (3, 8) next turn depending on their move. But let's look at the apples again. (2, 8) is right above me. If Snake 1 moves RIGHT (towards (4, 8) - wait, that's their body) or DOWN to (3, 7), then (2, 8) is free. But snakes cannot move into their own body; Snake 1 must move LEFT (2, 8), UP (3, 9), or DOWN (3, 7). \n\nIf Snake 1 moves DOWN to (3, 7) and I move UP to (2, 8), we are both safe and I get an apple. If Snake 1 moves LEFT to (2, 8) and I move UP, we both die. \n\nGiven I have 0 apples, I need to get on the board. However, the safest move to stay alive and potentially grab (2, 8) if they move away is to wait or move to a spot where I can react. Moving UP is aggressive. Moving RIGHT returns me to a spot where I can contest the central apples.\n\nLet's try to take (2, 8). If I die, the game ends early, but I need to start scoring. Actually, a safer play is to move DOWN or LEFT to see where Snake 1 commits, but (2, 8) is very close. Let's consider Snake 1's incentives: they want to grow. (2, 8) is the closest apple for both of us.\n\nWait, if I move UP and they move LEFT, I die. If I move RIGHT and they move DOWN, I die. \nThe safest move is LEFT or DOWN. Let's go UP and risk it? No, let's be smarter. If I move DOWN to (2, 6), I'm safe and can see if they take (2, 8).\n\n**Plan:**\nMove DOWN to (2, 6). This avoids any immediate head-on collision with Snake 1 regardless of whether they move LEFT or DOWN. I will then reposition to take an apple based on their tail movement.\n\nDOWN",

Moving down would collide with Snake #0\u2019s head (head-on collision).\n     - **LEFT** to (2, 8) \u2192 **Apple!** (2, 8) is an apple.\n     - **RIGHT** to (4, 8) \u2192 Safe (your body is at (4, 8), but this is not your head\u2019s immediate next segment; moving right would place your head at (4, 8), which is your body segment (4, 8). **Wait, no!** Your body is [(4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7)]. The head is at (3, 8), so moving **RIGHT** to (4, 8) would place the head on top of your own body segment (4, 8). This is **dangerous** and would kill you.\n\n   **Correction:** Moving **RIGHT** to (4, 8) is **invalid** because (4, 8) is part of your body. So the only safe moves are **LEFT** to (2, 8) and **UP** (invalid).\n\n2. **Apples:**\n   - The apple at (2, 8) is directly **LEFT** of your head. Moving **LEFT** will eat it, growing your snake to length 5.\n   - Other apples are farther away: (8, 3), (6, 3), (9, 3).\n\n3. **Enemy:**\n   - Snake #0 is at (3, 7). If it moves **UP** to (3, 8), it would collide with you if you also move **LEFT** to (2, 8). However, Snake #0\u2019s head is at (3, 7), and moving **UP** would place it at (3, 8), which is your current head position. If Snake #0 moves **UP**, it would collide with your head (3, 8) if you don\u2019t move away. But since you\u2019re moving **LEFT** to (2, 8), Snake #0\u2019s head would move to (3, 8), which is now empty (since your head moves to (2, 8)). So no collision occurs if Snake #0 moves **UP**.\n   - If Snake #0 moves **DOWN** to (4, 7), it\u2019s safe for you.\n   - If Snake #0 moves **LEFT** to (2, 7) or **RIGHT** to (4, 7), it\u2019s also safe for you.\n\n4. **No immediate threats:** Snake #0 is not moving toward you aggressively yet, but we must assume it could move in any direction.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Safe Moves**\nPossible moves from (3, 8):\n1. **UP:** (3, 9) - **Invalid** (off the board).\n2. **DOWN:** (3, 7) - **Dangerous!** Snake #0\u2019s head is at (3, 7). Moving down would cause a head-on collision.\n3. **LEFT:** (2, 8) - **Apple!** Safe if Snake #0 doesn\u2019t move into (2, 8) or (3, 8).\n4. **RIGHT:** (4, 8) - **Dangerous!** Your own body segment.\n\n**Eliminate unsafe moves:** Only **LEFT** is safe and beneficial.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Apple Reachability**\n#### **Apple at (2, 8):**\n- Moving **LEFT** to (2, 8) is the best move because:\n  - It\u2019s an apple, so you grow and gain a point.\n  - It\u2019s the closest apple to you.\n- **Risk:** Snake #0 could move **UP** to (3, 8), but since you\u2019re moving **LEFT**, Snake #0\u2019s head would move to (3, 8), which is now empty (your head moves to (2, 8)). No collision occurs.\n\n#### **Other Apples:**\n- Moving toward (6, 3) or (8, 3) would require multiple moves and is not optimal at this point.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Future Flexibility**\n- Moving **LEFT** to (2, 8) is the best immediate move because:\n  - You eat an apple, increasing your length and score.\n  - After eating, your new head is at (2, 8), and your body is [(3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7)].\n  - From there, you can move toward the next closest apple, such as (6, 3) or (9, 3).\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Considerations**\n- Snake #0 is at (3, 7). If it moves **UP** to (3, 8), it would not collide with you since you\u2019re moving **LEFT** to (2, 8). Snake #0\u2019s head would move to (3, 8), which is now empty.\n- **No risk of collision** if Snake #0 moves **UP**.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (for future self):**\n1. **Eat the apple at (2, 8)** by moving **LEFT**. This grows your snake to length 5 and increases your score.\n2. **After eating (2, 8)**, your new head is at (2, 8), and your body is [(3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7)].\n   - Next, move toward the apple at (6, 3) or (9, 3). The apple at (6, 3) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance (6 units down + 3 units right = 9 units) compared to (9, 3) (7 units down + 6 units right = 13 units).\n   - To reach (6, 3), you could move **DOWN** to (2, 7), then **DOWN** to (2, 6), then **RIGHT** to (3, 6), etc.\n   - Watch Snake #0\u2019s movement. If it starts moving toward you, adjust your path to avoid collisions.\n3. **Avoid getting trapped**. Since you\u2019re now length 5, ensure you don\u2019t move into your own body.\n4. **After eating (6, 3)**, plan your next move toward the next closest apple, such as (8, 3) or (9, 3).\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision:**\n**LEFT** is the best move to eat the apple at (2, 8) while avoiding immediate threats.\n\n**LEFT**",

If it moves **UP** to (3, 7), it would collide with your head if you move **RIGHT** to (3, 7). However, moving **DOWN** to (2, 6) avoids this threat.\n- **No risk of collision** if Snake #0 moves **DOWN** or **LEFT** from its current position.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (for future self):**\n1. **Move DOWN** to (2, 6) to safely navigate toward the apple at (6, 3).\n2. **After moving to (2, 6)**, your body will be [(2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7)].\n   - Next, move **RIGHT** to (3, 6) to get closer to the apple at (6, 3).\n   - Then, move **DOWN** to (3, 5), then **RIGHT** to (4, 5), and so on, until you reach (6, 3).\n3. **Watch Snake #0\u2019s movement**. If it starts moving toward you, adjust your path to avoid collisions.\n4. **After eating (6, 3)**, plan your next move toward the next closest apple, such as (8, 3) or (9, 3).\n5. **Avoid getting trapped**. Since you\u2019re now length 6, ensure you don\u2019t move into your own body.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision:**\n**DOWN** is the best move to safely navigate toward the apple at (6, 3) while avoiding immediate threats.\n\n**DOWN**",

Potential head-on collision if Snake 1 moves RIGHT. Since I have 0 apples and they have 3, a head-on collision results in a loss for me.\n4. **RIGHT:** Moves to (5, 6). Safe, but moves away from the immediate apple.\n\n**Strategic Situation:**\nThe apple at (4, 7) is directly above me. Snake 1 is at (2, 6).

I will then look toward the cluster of apples in the bottom right (6, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3) or the far right apple at (9, 7) depending on Snake 1's movement.

There is a single apple at (9, 7) and a cluster at (4, 3), (6, 3), (8, 3), and (9, 3).\nSnake 1 is at (3, 5) and likely moving toward the cluster or trying to cut me off. \n- Moving **RIGHT** to (6, 7) puts me closer to the (9, 7) apple.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (5, 6) starts the path toward the larger cluster at Y=3.\n\nHowever, if I move RIGHT to (6, 7), Snake 1 (at 3, 5) cannot reach me or intercept that apple easily. If I move DOWN, I might end up in a head-to-head positioning battle for the Y=3 apples sooner. Moving RIGHT allows me to take the \"high\" apple and then drop down on the cluster from the right side, potentially trapping or outmaneuvering Snake 1.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove RIGHT to (6, 7) to harvest the (9, 7) apple, then move down the 9th column to sweep the remaining apples from right to left.\n\nRIGHT",

To reach it, you need to move **DOWN** to (4, 3), then **RIGHT** to (5, 3), then **DOWN** to (6, 3).\n   - The apple at (8, 3) is also reachable via **DOWN** to (4, 3), then **RIGHT** to (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3).\n   - The apple at (9, 3) is farther but reachable via **DOWN** to (4, 3), then **RIGHT** to (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3).\n   - The apple at (9, 7) is farther away and less efficient to reach from this position.\n\n3. **Enemy:**\n   - Snake #0 is at (7, 7). If it moves **LEFT** to (6, 7), it could threaten your path if you move **RIGHT** to (5, 4) and then **UP** to (5, 5), etc.\n   - Snake #0 could also move **DOWN** to (7, 6) or **UP** to (7, 8), but these are less threatening to your current path.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Safe Moves**\nPossible moves from (4, 4):\n1. **UP:** (4, 5) - **Dangerous!** Your body segment.\n2. **DOWN:** (4, 3) - **Safe** and useful for reaching apples like (6, 3) or (8, 3).\n3. **LEFT:** (3, 4) - **Safe** but less strategic for immediate apple collection.\n4. **RIGHT:** (5, 4) - **Safe** but less efficient for reaching the closest apple at (6, 3).\n\n**Eliminate unsafe moves:** Only **DOWN**, **LEFT**, and **RIGHT** are safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Apple Reachability**\n#### **Apple at (6, 3):**\n- Moving **DOWN** to (4, 3) is safe and could lead to a path toward (6, 3) via (5, 3), then (6, 3).\n\n#### **Apple at (8, 3):**\n- Moving **DOWN** to (4, 3) and then **RIGHT** to (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3) is also possible.\n\n#### **Apple at (9, 3):**\n- Moving **DOWN** to (4, 3) and then **RIGHT** to (5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3), (9, 3) is possible but requires more steps.\n\n---\n\n### **Evaluating Future Flexibility**\n- Moving **DOWN** to (4, 3) is the most strategic move to reach the closest apple at (6, 3) efficiently.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (3, 4) or **RIGHT** to (5, 4) is less efficient for immediate apple collection.\n\n---\n\n### **Enemy Considerations**\n- Snake #0 is at (7, 7). If it moves **LEFT** to (6, 7), it could threaten your path if you move **UP** to (4, 5) (which is unsafe anyway). However, since Snake #0 is not directly threatening your current path, it is less of a concern for this move.\n\n---\n\n### **Long-Term Strategy Note (for future self):**\n1. **Move DOWN** to (4, 3) to safely navigate toward the apple at (6, 3).\n2. **After moving to (4, 3)**, your body will be [(4, 4), (4, 5), (3, 5), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 8), (5, 7)].\n   - Next, move **RIGHT** to (5, 3) to get closer to the apple at (6, 3).\n   - Then, move **DOWN** to (6, 3) to eat the apple.\n3. **After eating (6, 3)**, plan your next move toward the next closest apple, such as (8, 3) or (9, 3).\n4. **Watch Snake #0\u2019s movement**. If it starts moving toward your body, adjust your path to avoid collisions.\n5. **Avoid getting trapped**. Since you\u2019re now length 11, ensure you don\u2019t move into your own body.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision:**\n**DOWN** is the safest and most strategic move to avoid immediate threats and move closer to the reachable apple at (6, 3).\n\n**DOWN**",

I cannot realistically contest (9, 3) without risking a collision or getting trapped.\n- My best path to victory is to head towards the upper-right/middle cluster: (8, 8), (5, 8), and (7, 9).\n- Moving **UP** to (8, 6) keeps me one step ahead of the tail segment at (9, 6) which will move to (9, 5) this turn, and it puts distance between me and Snake #1 while moving towards food.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nMove towards (8, 8) and (7, 9). These apples are relatively safe for me to grab. Avoid the bottom-right corner where Snake #1 is currently positioned. Watch Snake #1's movement to ensure they don't try to cut off my path to the top.\n\nUP",

Safe, but UP is more direct toward the cluster.\n- **RIGHT:** Moves to (8, 7). **DEATH** (Backwards into body at 8, 7).\n\n**Enemy Analysis:**\nSnake #1 is at (8, 4). They are likely moving UP toward the apple cluster.\n- If Snake #1 moves UP, they reach (8, 5).\n- If I move UP, I reach (7, 8). \nWe are not at risk of a head-on collision this turn.\n\n**Strategy:**\nMoving UP to (7, 8) is the most efficient path to harvest the cluster. From (7, 8), I can take (8, 8) or (7, 9) next turn. I have a significant positional advantage over the cluster compared to Snake #1. I should focus on claiming these five apples to close the score gap (ID 0: 4, Snake #1: 7).\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (7, 8).
