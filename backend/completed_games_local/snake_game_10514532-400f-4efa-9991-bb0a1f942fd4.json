Moving off the board is impossible, and there's no snake body to collide with.  \n\n### Step 2: Proximity to apples  \nThe closest apples are (7,6) and (6,7) with Manhattan distance 3. Moving **RIGHT** to (5,6) reduces the distance to (7,6) to 2 (right 2) and to (6,7) to 2 (right 1, up 1), keeping me on a path toward these apples.  \n\n### Step 3: Enemy snake safety  \nEnemy snake 1 (head at (6,3), body [(7,3), (8,3)]) cannot move RIGHT (into its own body) and must move UP, DOWN, or LEFT. Its next head positions are (6,4), (6,2), or (5,3), which do not overlap with any of my possible moves. Thus, no collision risk.  \n\n### Step 4: Future flexibility  \nMoving **RIGHT** to (5,6) leaves multiple safe follow-up moves: UP (5,7), DOWN (5,5), LEFT (4,6), or RIGHT (6,6). This keeps options open, avoiding dead-ends.  \n\n### Long-term plan  \nPrioritize moving toward (7,6) and (6,7) to increase apple collection chances. Stay in the upper mid-board (y=5-8) to avoid enemy snakes in the lower region, maintaining flexibility for growth.  \n\nRIGHT",

This positions me to collect the apple at (9, 0) next turn, assuming no conflict with the enemy snake.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful about the enemy snake's potential moves.

Our possible moves (UP:7,9; DOWN:7,7; LEFT:6,8) do not collide with enemy head positions.  \n\n### Long-Term Plan\nPrioritize moving toward the closest apple.

The enemy could move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. If the enemy moves RIGHT to (7, 7), it would be diagonally adjacent to my head at (8, 2), but not directly threatening me on my UP move to (8, 3).\n\nMoving UP to get the apple at (8, 3) is clearly the best option:\n1.

No collision.\nDOWN: (7,7) - Not part of my body. Safe.\nLEFT: (6,8) - On board. No collision.\nRIGHT: (8,8) - That's my own body segment immediately behind my head! That would be a self-collision and instant death.\n\nSo I must eliminate RIGHT as a possible move.\n\nEnemy snake ID 0 is at:\nHead: (4,4)\nBody: [(5,4),(5,5),(4,5),(4,6),(5,6)]\n\nApples are at: (2, 0), (9, 0), (1, 7), (1, 5), (4, 1)\nI have 6 apples, enemy has 5.\n\nLet me consider future-proofing: I want to avoid getting trapped and also move toward apples.\n\nLooking at the board:\n(7,8) is my head.\n(1,7) is an apple. That's on the same row as me but far to the left. To get there I'd move LEFT then UP or LEFT several times.\n(1,5) is another apple, also to the left.\n(4,1) is an apple on the bottom rows.\n(2,0) and (9,0) are on the bottom edge.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,8), I get closer to the left-side apples.\nIf I move UP to (7,9), I move toward the top edge, away from most apples.\nIf I move DOWN to (7,7), I move toward the middle of the board.\n\nMy long-term goal should be to collect more apples than the enemy to increase my score. I'm currently doing well with 6 apples.\n\nLooking at proximity of options:\n(6,8) - Moving LEFT puts me further from the enemy head at (4,4), which is good.\n(7,9) - Moving UP also puts me further from the enemy.\n(7,7) - Moving DOWN keeps me in similar territory but away from immediate apples.\n\nThe move DOWN to (7,7) seems quite safe and keeps me in the board center. From (7,7) I could go LEFT toward apples or UP/ DOWN depending on next turn.\n\nUP would put me at (7,9) - top edge, no direct benefit immediately.\nLEFT would put me at (6,8) - good for approaching left apples.\nDOWN would put me at (7,7) - safe, keeps me mobile.\n\nAll three (UP, LEFT, DOWN) seem viable.\n\nLet me double-check for any impending threats if I go DOWN.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,7):\nThe enemy at (4,4) can move UP to (4,5) - collision with its own body, no.\nDOWN to (4,3) - safe.\nLEFT to (3,4) - safe.\nRIGHT to (5,4) - collision with its own body, no.\n\nSo the enemy can go (4,3), (3,4) safely.\n\nIf I go (7,7), the enemy is at (4,4). Distance between (7,7) and (4,4) is 3 in x, 3 in y. We're not close enough to worry about immediate confrontation in the next turn. I should be fine.\n\nLet me now check if I go LEFT to (6,8):\nAgain, enemy at (4,4), distance becomes 2 in y, 2 in x. That's still acceptable.\n\nBoth seem fine.\n\nBut remember last turn, I moved LEFT from (8,8) to (7,8) to collect an apple that was at (7,8). I need to be careful not to repeat patterns that lead nowhere.\n\nActually, last turn I was at (8,8) and moved LEFT to (7,8) and successfully collected the apple that was there. Now I\u2019m at (7,8).\n\nWait, re-checking the board:\nApples are at: (2, 0), (9, 0), (1, 7), (1, 5), (4, 1)\n\nThere is NO apple at (7,8) right now. I see that I misread last time's board. The apple I collected last time must have been somewhere else.\n\nLooking at current board again:\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . 1 T .\n 7 . A . . . . . . T .\n 6 . . . . T T . . T .\n 5 . A . . T T . . T .\n 4 . . . . 0 T . . T .\n 3 . . . . . . . . T .\n 2 . . . . . . . . . .\n 1 . . . . A . . . . .\n 0 . . A . . . . . . A\n\nI am at (7,8). There is no 'A' at (7,8). So I did not collect anything last move. That's why I have only 6 apples still. My body is long because I've grown over time.\n\nLet\u2019s think again. I cannot move RIGHT because that\u2019s into my own neck (8,8). Illegal.\n\nRemaining legal moves:\nUP to (7,9)\nDOWN to (7,7)\nLEFT to (6,8)\n\nEach is safe from walls and body collisions.\n\nWhich gets me closer to an apple?\nFrom (7,8):\nApple at (1,7): Move LEFT twice, then UP six times\nApple at (1,5): Move LEFT six times, DOWN three times\nApple at (4,1): Move DOWN seven times, LEFT three times\nApple at (2,0): Move DOWN eight times, LEFT five times\nApple at (9,0): Move DOWN eight times, RIGHT twice\n\nAny of these paths are long. For the nearer ones, let's look at (1,7) and (1,5)\n\nTo get to (1,7):\nCurrent head (7,8). Need to go LEFT 6 steps to x=1, then DOWN 1 step to y=7.\nThat\u2019s (1,7)\n\nTo get to (1,5):\nNeed to go LEFT 6 steps, DOWN 3 steps.\n\nFor (1,7):\nIf I move LEFT now to (6,8), I reduce x-distance to it by 1.\nIf I move DOWN to (7,7), I reduce y-distance to (1,7) by 1.\nIf I move UP to (7,9), I increase y-distance to (1,7) by 1.\n\nFor (1,5):\nIf I move LEFT to (6,8), I reduce x-distance by 1.\nIf I move DOWN to (7,7), I reduce y-distance by 1.\nIf I move UP to (7,9), I increase y-distance by 1.\n\nSo LEFT and DOWN both progress toward those targets.\n\nUP takes me further from both targets. That\u2019s worse unless I have a clear strategic reason like avoiding a future trap coming from below.\n\nDOWN looks good.\n\nBut LEFT also looks good. I might prefer LEFT slightly if all else equal, because moving left early puts me in better column position earlier.\n\nHowever, the enemy is at (4,4). If I go LEFT to (6,8), I\u2019m at (6,8). Enemy at (4,4). Distance squared = (6-4)^2 + (8-4)^2 = 4+16=20.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (7,7), distance = (7-4)^2 + (7-4)^2 = 9 + 9 = 18. Slightly closer.\n\nIf I go UP to (7,9), distance = (7-4)^2 + (9-4)^2 = 9 + 25 = 34. Further away.\n\nDOWN actually is slightly safer. And DOWN still progresses toward target apples like (1,5) and (1,7) by reducing my vertical displacement.\n\nLet\u2019s pick DOWN.\n\nLong-term plan: \nMove toward accessible apples on the left side of the board while maintaining maneuverability. Avoid moving toward the enemy snake and aim to collect more apples before it does.\n\nDOWN",

Illegal.\n- DOWN: (4, 1) - safe, and there's an apple there.\n- LEFT: (3, 2) - safe.\n- RIGHT: (5, 2) - safe.\n\nIf I go UP to (6, 8):\n- I'm moving away from the enemy, which is good.\n- But I'm not making direct progress toward any apples.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6, 6):\n- I'm getting closer to apples (4, 1) and (2, 0).\n- Distance from enemy remains the same.\n- But the enemy might move DOWN to (4, 1) to get the apple there.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (5, 7):\n- I'm making direct progress toward apples (1, 7) and (1, 5).\n- Distance from enemy remains the same.\n- This move maximizes my progress toward reachable apples.\n\nLet me consider what might happen if the enemy goes for the apple at (4, 1):\n- The enemy would go DOWN to (4, 1).\n- Then I'd be at (6, 7) or (5, 7) with the enemy at (4, 1).\n- That would put more distance between us, which is good.\n\nComparing the options:\n- UP: Moves away from immediate apple targets.\n- DOWN: Moves toward some apples but in a different direction than my closer targets.\n- LEFT: Directly toward my closest apples (1, 7) and (1, 5).\n\nThe LEFT move is most strategic for reaching apples while maintaining safety.\n\nLong-term plan:\nContinue moving LEFT toward the apples at x=1 column. After reaching x=1, I can move UP or DOWN to collect those apples. Keep monitoring the enemy snake and avoid getting boxed in, especially as the board gets more crowded with bodies.\n\nLEFT",

I need to be mindful of my length and potential conflicts with the enemy snake as it's also moving toward apples in the lower part of the board.\n\nLEFT",

Not in my current body (body segments are (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)). No enemy snake heads are at (0,1). Valid.  \n- **DOWN**: (0, -1). Outside the board (y < 0). Invalid.  \n- **LEFT**: (-1, 0). Outside the board (x < 0). Invalid.  \n- **RIGHT**: (1, 0). This is the second segment of my body (directly behind the head). Moving into this position counts as hitting myself, which is invalid.  \n\n### Step 2: Evaluate future options  \nOnly **UP** is a valid move. Moving to (0,1) means the new body will be [(0,1), (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)]. The next possible moves from (0,1) could be LEFT (-1,1, invalid), RIGHT (1,1), UP (0,2), or DOWN (0,0, which is now part of the body but the tail would have moved, so need to check). However, the key point is no other moves keep the snake alive.  \n\n### Step 3: Enemy and apple considerations  \nEnemy snake #1 is far away, so no collision risk. While there are apples at (1,7) and (1,5), they are in the x=1 row, but the only safe move now is UP.  \n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Move up to (0,1) to start exploring the left side of the board, maintaining upward flexibility and avoiding immediate danger.  \n\nUP",

Illegal.\n\nThe enemy snake can only move UP to (0, 1) or remain in place (which is not an option). So it will likely move UP.\n\nComparing my options:\n- UP: Moves toward the top edge, away from the nearest apple.\n- DOWN: Directly collects apple (1, 7), which is adjacent to my head.\n- LEFT: Moves me away from apples toward the edge.\n\nMoving DOWN to (1, 7) seems to be the most strategic move as it:\n1. Immediately collects an apple, increasing my score to 7 apples\n2. Is a safe move with no immediate collision risk\n3. Positions me well for future moves\n4. Reduces the distance to other apples like (1, 5)\n\nThis move also keeps my options open for the next turn. After moving to (1, 7), I'll have several possible moves for the next turn since I'll have eaten an apple and grown.\n\nLong-term plan:\nMove DOWN to (1, 7) this turn to collect the apple.

The body segment at (2, 1) is there, but (1, 1) appears to be empty, so DOWN is legal for the enemy.\n\nThe enemy could move UP to (1, 3), DOWN to (1, 1), or RIGHT to (2, 2).\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 6), I'll be at the same Y-coordinate as the enemy's possible moves to (2, 2), but at X=1 vs X=2, so no direct collision risk immediately. But I'd be closer to the enemy's head at (1, 2).\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 5), I'll be at (2, 5) which is very close to the apple at (2, 4) - just one move away.\n\nComparing my options:\n- DOWN moves me to (2, 5), putting me 1 move away from apple at (2, 4) \n- LEFT moves me to (1, 6), putting me 1 move away from apple at (1, 5)\n- RIGHT moves me away from apples\n\nBoth DOWN and LEFT put me 1 move away from an apple, but let me consider future moves:\n\nAfter DOWN to (2, 5), next turn I could go DOWN to (2, 4) to get that apple.\nAfter LEFT to (1, 6), next turn I could DOWN to (1, 5) to get that apple.\n\nLet me check if the enemy can interfere with either path:\n- If I go DOWN to (2, 5) now, the apple is at (2, 4). The enemy at (1, 2) could go RIGHT to (2, 2), then UP toward me, but it would take multiple turns.\n- If I go LEFT to (1, 6) now, the apple is at (1, 5). The enemy at (1, 2) could go UP toward (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5). This creates a potential head-on collision path!\n\nLooking more carefully at the enemy path:\n- Enemy at (1, 2) going UP would be (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5) \n- If I go LEFT to (1, 6), then DOWN to (1, 5), we could collide head-on\n\nBut if I go DOWN to (2, 5) now, then DOWN to (2, 4) next turn, the enemy would have to go RIGHT to (2, 2), then UP multiple times to reach (2, 4), which is slower.\n\nAlso, by going DOWN to (2, 5), I keep more options open for future moves and don't position myself in a direct line with the enemy.\n\nDOWN to (2, 5) seems like the better choice as it moves me toward a nearby apple while avoiding direct confrontation with the enemy path and keeping future options open.\n\nDOWN",

Illegal move.\n- DOWN: (2, 3) - Safe move.\n- LEFT: (1, 4) - This is the enemy snake's head! Potential head-on collision.\n- RIGHT: (3, 4) - Safe move.\n\nSo my legal moves are DOWN and RIGHT.\n\nThe enemy snake at (1, 4) has these options:\n- UP: (1, 5) - Safe move.\n- DOWN: (1, 3) - Collision with its own body at (1, 3), illegal.\n- LEFT: (0, 4) - Safe move.\n- RIGHT: (2, 4) - This is my head! Potential head-on collision.\n\nThis means if I choose LEFT to (1, 4) and the enemy chooses RIGHT to (2, 4), we have a head-on collision and both die. Similarly, if the enemy chooses RIGHT to (2, 4) and I'm staying at (2, 4), that's also a collision.\n\nBut I can't move LEFT anyway because that's where the enemy's head is.\n\nDOWN to (2, 3):\n- This is a safe move.\n- No immediate apple there.\n- Next turn I'll have more options.\n\nRIGHT to (3, 4):\n- This is a safe move.\n- I avoid the potential collision area.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's likely move. The enemy is at (1, 4) and has apples at (1, 5) and other locations. Moving UP to (1, 5) gets it closer to an apple. Moving LEFT to (0, 4) is safe but moves away from apples. Moving RIGHT to (2, 4) would try to contest space with me.\n\nIf the enemy moves UP to (1, 5), it positions itself near the apple at (1, 5).\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (0, 4), it moves away from apples.\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT to (2, 4), it risks a head-on collision.\n\nThe smartest move for the enemy is probably UP to (1, 5) to get closer to that apple.\n\nGiven this, let me reconsider my position:\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 4):\n- I avoid any collision risk.\n- I position myself closer to potential future apples.\n- I stay in open space.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2, 3):\n- I avoid any collision risk.\n- I'm moving away from the main apple concentration areas.\n\nLooking at the board again, moving RIGHT to (3, 4) keeps me in a better strategic position. I'm not boxed in, and I have good access to areas with apples.\n\nAlso, if I move RIGHT to (3, 4) and the enemy moves UP to (1, 5), we're not contesting the same space directly.\n\nRIGHT",

In the last move info it said my head was at (3, 4), but now it shows my head at (3, 5). Since I moved UP in my last turn, going from (3, 4) to (3, 5) makes sense. So my current position is correct.\n\nNow let me check the enemy snake:\n- Enemy head at (1, 6)\n- Enemy body [(1, 5), (1, 4), (1, 3), (1, 2), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)]\n\nLet me identify all available apples:\nApples at: (9, 0), (9, 3), (7, 7), (3, 6), (7, 3)\n\nMy possible moves from (3, 5):\n- UP: (3, 6) - This is where an apple is!\n- DOWN: (3, 4) - This is part of my own body, illegal move.\n- LEFT: (2, 5) - This is part of my own body, illegal move.\n- RIGHT: (4, 5) - This is a safe move.\n\nWait, let me double-check the DOWN and LEFT moves. Looking at my body: [(3, 4), (2, 4), ...]\nSo (3, 4) IS indeed part of my body, and (2, 5) IS indeed part of my body. \n\nActually wait, looking more carefully at my body path to understand the connectivity:\nHead (3,5) -> (3,4) -> (2,4) -> (2,5) -> etc\n\nSo the segments adjacent to my head (3,5) are:\n- (3,4) which is my neck/body\n- There's no segment at (3,6) yet\n\nThis means:\n- UP: (3, 6) - Apple location! And it's safe.\n- DOWN: (3, 4) - Illegal, it's my neck.\n- LEFT: (2, 5) - Illegal, it's part of my body but not adjacent to head.\n- RIGHT: (4, 5) - Safe move.\n\nActually, let me be very careful here. \nIf my head is at (3,5) and my first body segment is at (3,4), then moving DOWN would mean moving into my own neck which is always illegal - I can never move backwards into myself.\n\nBut UP to (3,6) would collect an apple! This is excellent. Let me make sure this is actually safe.\n\nLooking at (3,6): is anything there? From the board display, it appears empty except for the apple noted there.\n\nBut let me also double-check the enemy snake's possible moves:\nEnemy head at (1,6) can move to:\n- UP: (1,7) - Safe\n- DOWN: (1,5) - That's its own body/neck, illegal\n- LEFT: (0,6) - Safe\n- RIGHT: (2,6) - Let me see what's there...\n\nThere could potentially be conflict if the enemy tries to move to (2,6) when I move to (3,6). But those are different cells, so not a direct conflict.\n\nAlso, (4,5) would be a good alternative safe move that keeps me moving generally upward toward apples. But getting an apple is definitely worth it.\n\nLet me think ahead about what happens after I eat the apple:\nMy new head would be at (3,6) and my old head (3,5) becomes my new first body segment. The tail presumably gets removed unless I grow due to eating the apple at (3,6)...Yes, collecting an apple means I grow.\n\nSo yes, moving UP to (3,6) to collect the apple is my preferred move.\n\nHowever, I should consider if the enemy poses any immediate threat.\n\nThe apple at (3,6) is quite valuable, being nearest to me.\n\nMy decision:\n1. UP to (3,6) gets me an apple and is safe\n2. RIGHT to (4,5) is also safe but doesn't get an apple immediately\n3. Other directions are illegal\n\nUP looks like the clear best choice.\n\nShort term strategy: Collect as many nearby apples as possible before they're gone, avoid the longer enemy snake.\n\nUP",

No, wait, looking at the board display, (3, 7) shows as empty but I need to be careful.\n- DOWN: (3, 5) - This is my own body (neck), illegal move.\n- LEFT: (2, 6) - This is part of my own body, illegal move.\n- RIGHT: (4, 6) - This appears to be safe and open.\n\nWait, let me double-check UP to (3, 7). Looking at my body segments: (2, 7) and (1, 7) are occupied by my body. But (3, 7) is not part of my body as far as I can tell.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the board visualization and my body coordinates, (3, 7) appears to be free. However, I should be cautious as it's adjacent to my body segment at (2, 7).\n\nLet me check if moving UP to (3, 7) would put me in danger from the enemy snake.\nThe enemy snake's head is at (0, 6). Its possible moves:\n- UP: (0, 7)\n- DOWN: (0, 5) - This would be into its own neck, illegal\n- LEFT: (-1, 6) - Off the board, illegal\n- RIGHT: (1, 6) - But (1, 6) is part of its own body, illegal\n\nSo the enemy can only move to (0, 7) or stay put (which isn't an option).\n\nIf I move UP to (3, 7), I don't see immediate danger from the enemy. But I should also consider whether this leads to a good position.\n\nActually, let me recheck the board visualization. Looking at row 7: \". T T . . . . A . .\" \nPosition (3, 7) corresponds to the '.' which means empty. So UP to (3, 7) seems safe.\n\nRIGHT to (4, 6) also seems safe, and opens up more space to the right side of the board.\n\nBut I also need to think strategically. There are apples at (7, 3), (7, 7), (9, 3), etc. Moving toward the right side of the board might be beneficial.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider that moving UP to (3, 7) keeps me in the upper part of the board where some apples are.\n\nLet me think about future moves from both positions:\nFrom (3, 7): I could continue UP, RIGHT, or DOWN (but DOWN would be back toward my previous position)\nFrom (4, 6): I could go UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT - more options.\n\nAlso, the enemy is constrained on its left side, so moving right might be safer.\n\nLet me also consider if either move puts me in immediate danger of collision. The enemy is at (0, 6), and we're separated by some distance.\n\nMy decision: Moving RIGHT to (4, 6) gives me more maneuverability and moves me away from potential future conflicts with the enemy snake while keeping options open.\n\nShort-term strategy: Move right to open up more board space, avoid getting trapped on the left side, and position myself to access apples in the upper-right portion of the board.\n\nRIGHT",

That means the enemy cannot move RIGHT to (1,7) because that's blocked by my body.\n\nSo the enemy can only move UP to (0,8) or stay in place (but staying in place isn't a move).\n\nIf I move UP to (4,7), I'm still safe from the enemy.\n\nWhat about going RIGHT to (5,6)? This also seems safe and gives me space to maneuver.\n\nBut strategically, I want to position myself to go after the apples at (7,7) and (7,3).\n\nLet me see which move gives better access to apples:\n\nUP to (4,7) gets me positioned more toward the upper part where (7,7) is\nRIGHT to (5,6) also moves me toward the center-right part of the board\n\nBut I also notice the enemy is constrained on its left side, so it's unlikely to come right across the board.\n\nActually, let me be very careful about DOWN to (4,5).

I think RIGHT is the best choice as it opens up space and moves me toward the cluster of apples in the right portion of the board.\n\n**Short-term strategy:** Move right to open up more board space and access to apples in the right portion of the board while maintaining safe distance from enemy.\n\nRIGHT",

T T . . . . A . .\"\n- Position (5, 7) shows as '.' (empty), so it's safe\n\nDOWN to (5, 5):\n- Looking at the board visualization, row 5 is: \". T T T . . . . . .\"\n- Position (5, 5) shows as '.', so it's safe\n\nRIGHT to (6, 6):\n- Looking at board row 6: \"T T T T T 1 . . . .\"\n- Position (6, 6) shows as '.', so it's safe\n\nAll three valid moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) appear to be safe.\n\n**Strategic Analysis**\n\nNow I need to consider which move gives me the best strategic position:\n\n1. UP to (5, 7): Moves me toward the apple at (7, 7) and generally upward where there are more apples\n2. DOWN to (5, 5): Moves me away from most apples and toward the lower part of the board\n3. RIGHT to (6, 6): Moves me toward the right side where apples (7, 7) and (7, 3) are located\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (0, 8), its possible moves are:\n- UP: (0, 9) - Off board, illegal\n- DOWN: (0, 7) - Blocked by its own body\n- LEFT: (-1, 8) - Off board, illegal\n- RIGHT: (1, 8) - Let's check if this is safe\n\nRow 8 shows: \"0 . . . . . . . . .\"\nPosition (1, 8) is empty, so the enemy could move RIGHT to (1, 8).\n\nThis means the enemy is likely constrained but could move right. I should avoid moving in a way that creates immediate conflict.\n\nComparing my options:\n- UP moves me toward the center-top area with apple (7, 7)\n- RIGHT moves me toward the right side with apples (7, 7) and (7, 3)\n- DOWN moves me away from apples\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT seem strategically sound. Let me think about which gives better future options.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 6) puts me in a good position to access the right side apples and keeps me away from the enemy.\n\nHowever, moving UP to (5, 7) also positions me well for the apple at (7, 7) and keeps me in the middle of the board.\n\nLet me consider potential future moves from each position:\n\nFrom (6, 6) after moving RIGHT:\n- Could go UP to (6, 7), RIGHT to (7, 6), or DOWN to (6, 5)\n\nFrom (5, 7) after moving UP:\n- Could go UP to (5, 8), RIGHT to (6, 7), or LEFT to (4, 7)\n\nBoth seem viable, but RIGHT seems to open up access to multiple apples more directly.\n\nActually, let me recheck if UP to (5, 7) is safe by looking more carefully at the body positions.\n\nMy body segments include (4, 6) which is directly to my left - that's my neck so LEFT is illegal as expected.\n\nUP to (5, 7) looks safe as it's an empty space.\n\nRIGHT to (6, 6) also looks safe.\n\nI think I'll go RIGHT to position myself better for the right-side apples while maintaining good board position.\n\n**Short-term strategy:** Move right to position for apples on the right side while keeping good mobility and avoiding the enemy.\n\nRIGHT",

Their legal moves are therefore just UP to (6, 8).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 8):\n- My head will be at (9, 8)\n- Their potential move UP puts their head at (6, 8)\n- No head-on collision risk\n- The space is clear (it's a '.' in the visualization when I look carefully again - the previous '.' might have been misinterpreted)\n\nActually, re-checking the board:\nRow 8: T T T T T T . T 1 .\nRow 7: T . . . . T 0 T . .\n\nPosition (9, 8) is marked as '1' which should be my head, but according to our position, my head was at (8, 9) last turn. There seems to be an inconsistency. Let me re-read with care.\n\nCurrent head: (8, 8) [after last move DOWN from (8, 9)]\nSo the correct row 8 should reflect:\nRow 8: \". . . . . . . T 1 .\"\nWhich means (9, 8) is empty ('.') - so it's a valid safe move. Also, position (8, 8) now has '1' which is correct for my current head location.\n\nSo:\nUP to (8, 9) - My own body segment, illegal\nDOWN to (8, 7) - My own body segment, illegal\nLEFT to (7, 8) - My own body segment, illegal\nRIGHT to (9, 8) - Safe, legal move\n\nThere is only one valid move: RIGHT\n\nStrategic evaluation:\n- This keeps me moving away from the top edge where I could get trapped\n- It positions me closer to apples at x=9 (specifically (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0))\n- The enemy is constrained \u2013 if they move UP next turn, it might open opportunities for me to take an apple near center/top\n\nI must move RIGHT because all other moves are illegal.\n\n**Future Self Note:** \nAfter moving to x=9, watch for shortest safe paths down toward apples at y levels 0-3, particularly (9, 3) and (9, 1). Ensure escape routes remain open. Watch enemy movement pattern carefully as they're close and nearly even on apples.\n\nRIGHT",

It doesn't put me closer to a wall (top edge)\n2. It maintains more strategic flexibility to angle down toward apples on right edge\n3. Avoids potential future squeeze from top if enemy or board layout blocks further upward options\n\nAlso, the apple at (9, 3) is reachable going this way and more importantly (9, 1) and (9, 0) too.\n\n**Short Term Strategy Note:** \nContinue moving downward along the right edge to safely approach available apples at (9, 3), (9, 1), (9, 0).

Maintain a path back inward from the edge \u2013 do not commit to full descent along edge unless I know I can return or get apples.\n\nDOWN",

No, because that square will have moved by then, so it's okay.\n\nActually, let's think about where the enemy is going. Snake #0's head is at (4, 9). Its possible moves:\n- UP: offboard\n- DOWN: (4, 8) - Occupied by its own body segment \u2192 illegal\n- LEFT: (3, 9) - Safe\n- RIGHT: (5, 9) - Occupied by its own body segment \u2192 illegal\n\nSo snake #0 likely goes LEFT to (3, 9).\n\nIf I go LEFT to (8, 5), I retain flexibility to either continue DOWN toward apples, or even reconsider direction.\n\nHowever, DOWN is also fine, and gets me closer to the apple at (9, 3) or (9, 1) faster. Going LEFT gives flexibility, but delays progress towards the apples below.\n\nThat said, the DOWN path remains wide open.\n\nI\u2019ll stick with my previous logic. DOWN is the best move for making progress toward key apples.\n\nDOWN\n\n**Short-Term Strategy Plan**: Continue moving DOWN towards apples at (9, 1) and (9, 0), staying along the right side of the board since it's safer and the path is open.

This also maintains clear space ahead and continues a consistent path along the right edge, which is safe and efficient.\n- LEFT moves away from the nearest apple and could start funneling me into a tighter right-side wall without clear gain, though it\u2019s safe.\n- No immediate threats from the enemy snake, which is focused on the upper middle-left area.\n\nDOWN gives me an apple immediately and keeps my options open after \u2014 no risk of trapping. This also keeps me away from potential future wall collisions and maintains good spacing for further maneuvers.\n\n**Short-Term Strategy Note:**\nContinue to prioritize collecting nearby apples efficiently. My vertical path has been strong and safe, so collecting the apple at (9, 0) keeps me aligned with that strategy. After that, I will likely shift left toward apples at (7, 3) and (5, 3) while avoiding any sharp inward turns that reduce future mobility.

It also moves me away from potential lateral interference from the enemy.\n- Moving LEFT to (7, 2) is more direct toward apple (7, 3), but positions me in a relatively narrower part of the board where future options may be limited.\n\nGiven the need for long-term flexibility, safety, and positioning for accessible apples:\nUP is the better choice.\n\n**Short-term strategy reminder for next turn:**\nMove UP to (8, 3). Maintain positioning in the center-right corridor to keep options open. Watch for enemy snake movement. Plan to approach apples (7, 3) or (5, 3) from a higher, flexible position. Avoid getting boxed in by my own body or the enemy.\n\nUP",

This allows me to secure another point soon while repositioning my body away from the right edge where it's starting to bunch up. Keeping mobility on the left side of the board will be beneficial.\n\nLEFT",

By moving left to collect the apple at (5, 3), I start pulling my body away from the right wall, giving more breathing room. This also brings me into a more central position, where multiple apples can be approached more easily in the near future.\n\nCollecting an apple now will increase my score to 15, widening the lead over snake #0 who is at 11 apples. Since the game ends at 50 apples or 150 turns, staying ahead helps maintain control and forces the enemy into tighter situations as space decreases.\n\nThe move LEFT toward (5, 3) gives a clear short-term gain, avoids traps, and opens better board access.\n\nLEFT",

I must now evaluate them based on strategic benefit, immediate safety, and future flexibility.\n\n1. **UP to (5, 4):**\n   - Moves the head upward, away from the lower part of the board.\n   - Keeps open space above for potential future movement.\n   - Positions me closer to apple (4, 6) without immediately threatening any apple.\n   - Distance to apple (4, 6) is now 3 steps.\n   - Doesn't risk bottlenecking or limiting escape routes yet.\n\n2. **DOWN to (5, 2):**\n   - Moves toward bottom apples (e.g., (3, 1), (5, 0)).\n   - Riskier in the long term as the bottom edge is nearby.\n   - Apple (5, 0) is still 3 steps away but will require more maneuvering.\n   - Could reduce future maneuverability due to lower board position.\n\n3. **LEFT to (4, 3):**\n   - Moves further left, away from the tight cluster of my own body on the right.\n   - Opens up board access to the left half, which currently has less clutter.\n   - Maintains a central Y-axis position (3) for better vertical flexibility.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\nMy snake is currently stretched vertically along the right edge, creating a potential future trap if further movement right or down occurs without sufficient space. Pulling left now helps alleviate this.\n\nUP is favorable because it moves toward the mid-board apple (4, 6) while maintaining vertical positioning safely away from the edge. It also keeps my head from getting pulled too deeply into the dense part of the snake body that\u2019s stacked along the X=9 column.\n\nDOWN could eventually box me in with no upside in terms of reachable apples within a few moves.\n\nLEFT is good for space opening, but does not advance me toward any immediate apple and keeps me in a neutral X position.\n\nGiven that (4, 6) is one of the closest apples and is in a reasonably neutral position, and UP improves access to it with no immediate threat, UP is the strongest move.\n\n**Future Plan (for next turn):**\nContinue moving up to target (4, 6) while avoiding clustering near walls or enemy. Reassess after collecting the apple to ensure escape routes remain open and that I\u2019m not boxing myself against my own body or the board edge.\n\nUP",

Reaching (5, 5) places me well for a subsequent diagonal approach to (4, 6).\n\n**Future Plan (for next turn):**\nMove toward (4, 6), likely with a LEFT or UP depending on legality from new head position. Keep monitoring the enemy snake for threat and avoid getting pinned on right edge.\n\nUP",

It\u2019s not immediately threatening, and our paths are not overlapping.\n\nMy long-term strategy should be:\n- Avoid bottlenecks and traps.\n- Position myself to approach multiple apples while keeping escape routes.\n- Head-on collisions or risky paths should be avoided.\n\nRIGHT seems like the best move \u2014 it moves me into open space, increases flexibility, and keeps me from drifting away from potential apple paths.

If it moves LEFT to (1, 8), it's not immediately threatening. If it moves UP to (2, 9), that's also not immediately threatening. If it moves DOWN to (2, 7), we'd be separated by a row.\n\nLooking at apples:\n- The (9, 9) apple is still the closest high-value target in the corner\n- The (5, 0) and (6, 0) apples are at the bottom\n- The (1, 1) and (3, 1) apples are accessible from below\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 8), I'd be getting closer to the (9, 9) apple but positioning myself near the edge. This could limit my options on the next turn.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6, 8), I'd be moving toward the center of the board, keeping more options open.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7, 7), I'd also be moving into open space.\n\nI should prioritize moves that keep future options open. Moving LEFT puts me in the most flexible position - I'd have open space in multiple directions and be well-positioned to either continue toward apples or maneuver around the enemy snake.\n\nLet me also consider the enemy's possible moves:\n- The enemy at (2, 8) could go LEFT to (1, 8), UP to (2, 9), or DOWN to (2, 7)\n- If the enemy goes DOWN, I should avoid going DOWN to (7, 7) to prevent getting too close on parallel rows\n\nActually, rethinking the position, I notice that if I go LEFT to (6, 8), I'm just two spaces away from the enemy head at (2, 8) horizontally, which could create a confrontation in the open area.\n\nGoing DOWN to (7, 7) moves me away from the enemy and into a safer open area, while still keeping options open for later moving toward the (9, 9) apple.\n\nDOWN",

Since I just moved LEFT from (6, 0) to (5, 0), I must have landed on that apple, meaning I should have grown and that apple is now gone. But the listed apples still include (5, 0), so maybe I misread last turn.\n\nWait \u2014 re-examining the board and apple list for this turn:\nApples at: (1, 1), (9, 9), (2, 0), (8, 1), (0, 2)\n\nAh, there is no apple at (5, 0) anymore. That means either I already collected it last turn, or it was a mistake in my previous reasoning.\n\nMy position is (5, 0). From here, the nearest apples are:\n- (2, 0) \u2014 3 steps left\n- (8, 1) \u2014 3 steps right, 1 up\n- (0, 2) \u2014 5 steps left, 2 up\n\nIf I move LEFT to (4, 0), I continue heading toward (2, 0). That seems like a decent plan.\n\nBut if I move UP to (5, 1), I move away from immediate apple paths, and I also move closer to the upper part of the board where enemy snake #0 might be a factor later.\n\nLet\u2019s check for threats.\n\nEnemy snake #0\u2019s head is at (3, 1). If it moves RIGHT to (4, 1), and I move UP to (5, 1), we are not colliding directly, but we\u2019d be in adjacent rows (y=1 and y=1 if it moves right to (4,1)? no, it\u2019s at (3,1), so right would be (4,1)).\n\nIf I go to (5,1):\n- Distance to nearest apples increases\n- Risk of getting boxed in near top edge later\n- Not immediately threatened by enemy\n\nIf I go to (4,0):\n- I move toward (2,0)\n- Keeps me closer to center-bottom\n- Slightly safer in terms of space, and maintains flexibility\n\nChecking body collision:\nMy body currently ends with ... (4,6), (5,6). So (4,0) is clear.\n\nAlso, moving LEFT: from (5,0) to (4,0) means my tail will shift, and previous (6,0) segment will disappear eventually. No conflict.\n\nFinal check:\n- LEFT to (4,0): safe, move toward apple at (2,0)\n- UP to (5,1): also safe, but moves me away from nearest apples and closer to possible enemy movement\n\nDecision: Move LEFT. I'm going for the apple at (2,0) which is reachable and gives me good space.\n\nShort-term plan: Head toward (2,0), avoid getting trapped along the left side. After collecting it, assess positioning relative to enemy snake.\n\nLEFT",

So that introduces risk of possible collision or close proximity.\n\nIf I stay low:\nEnemy is currently far enough vertically, but moving toward it in row y=1 is dangerous.\n\nInstead, look at whether UP to (4,1) is actually safe.\n\nEnemy possible moves from (3,1):\n- UP to (3,2)\n- DOWN to (3,0) \u2013 blocked by own body segment at (3,1) \u2192 No\n- LEFT to (2,1) \u2013 safe for it\n- RIGHT to (4,1) \u2013 collision danger\n\nIf I do UP to (4,1), and it does RIGHT to (4,1), it's a head-on collision \u2192 both die. If I survive, board stays open. But better to avoid high-risk lanes.\n\nAlternative: Look at longer survival + growth potential.\n\nCurrently:\nApples left: (1,1), (9,9), (2,0), (8,1), (0,2)\n\nAfter moving UP:\nNew head at (4,1), rest follows\n\nIf the enemy doesn\u2019t act unpredictably, and given my current trajectory, move UP seems okay now.\n\nStill, scanning map: I'm going upward from bottom. Plenty of space currently.\n\n**Strategic Note for Next Turn:**\nI am now heading slightly more upward, avoiding immediate risky horizontal contact.\nGoal: Try to move towards nearby apples like (2,0) and keep mid-board mobility.\nAvoid direct confrontation with enemy snake unless necessary or clear win.\n\nUP",

No.\n\u2705 Safe.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP and RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### Apple Proximity:\n\nApples at: (1,1), (9,9), (8,1), (0,2), (5,1)\n\n- My head is now at (5, 1)\n- Apple was at (5, 1), which I just collected.\n- Next closest reachable apples are (8, 1) and (9, 3)\n\nLet\u2019s assess which move gets me better future access:\n\n- Moving UP to (5, 2): moves me away from the immediate row where (8, 1) lies, but opens vertical mobility and gets me away from possible congestion in y=1.\n- Moving RIGHT to (6, 1): keeps me in row y=1, possibly setting up for (8, 1) next, but also risks being in a contested horizontal lane.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s double-check if RIGHT is safe long-term:\nIf I go RIGHT, I\u2019m at (6, 1). Then next turn, I might consider moving RIGHT again toward (7,1) or UP to (6,2). But staying in row 1 might limit escape options if enemy moves up or right unexpectedly.\n\nUP gives me more flexibility, clears horizontal clutter, and sets up good angle toward upper-right apples like (9,3) or (9,9), while avoiding potential conflict in the lower rows.\n\nAlso, notice that enemy snake head at (1,0) is boxed in a bit and going UP or RIGHT from there could make it dangerous, but still far enough not to directly threaten me.\n\n---\n\n### Safe move selection: UP or RIGHT\n\nPriority:\n1. Stay alive \u2705\n2. Collect apples\n3. Stay mobile\n4. Avoid enemy\n\nUP seems slightly better strategically \u2014 it improves escape paths and doesn\u2019t overcommit to a narrow area yet.\n\n**Plan ahead**:  \nMove UP to (5, 2). From there, I can continue evaluating paths to apples like (8, 1) via top or bottom routes, depending on how the board develops. Maintain vertical mobility. Watch enemy head closely.\n\nUP",

Yes.\n- Into my body? No \u2014 next segment is at (5, 2); (5, 4) is not occupied by me.\n- Into enemy snake? No \u2014 enemy head is at (0, 1); no part near (5, 4)\n\u2705 This is a safe move.\n\n#### **DOWN to (5, 2):**\n- On board? Yes.\n- Into my body? Yes \u2014 (5, 2) is part of my body.\n\u274c Fatal. Disqualified.\n\n#### **LEFT to (4, 3):**\n- On board? Yes.\n- Into my body? No.\n- Into enemy? No.\n\u2705 Safe.\n\n#### **RIGHT to (6, 3):**\n- On board? Yes.\n- Into my body? No.\n- Into enemy? No.\n\u2705 Safe.\n\nSo the safe moves are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### Apple Proximity:\n\nApples at: (9, 9), (8, 1), (0, 2), (9, 3), (4, 3)\n\nMy head is at (5, 3).\n\nThe apple at (4, 3) is directly adjacent \u2014 one move LEFT.\n\n(9, 3) is on the same row, but 4 moves away and potentially contested or blocked later.\n\n(8, 1) is 4 moves away via right/down path.\n\n(0, 2) and (9, 9) are very far.\n\nSo (4, 3) is the most immediately reachable apple.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluate Safe Moves Toward Apples:\n\n#### Move **LEFT** to (4, 3):\n- Collects apple immediately.\n+1 point, body grows, tail stays, new head at (4, 3).\n\u2705 Very good short-term gain.\n\n#### Move **UP** to (5, 4):\n- Moves slightly away from body cluster; keeps options open.\n- From (5, 4), still able to go LEFT to (4, 3) next turn.\n\u2705 Good for future flexibility.\n\n#### Move **RIGHT** to (6, 3):\n- Does not advance toward (4, 3).\n- Leads towards (9, 3) or (8, 1), which are slower to reach.\n\u274c Less efficient immediate target.\n\nLEFT collects an apple immediately and increases score.\n\nUP keeps options open but delays apple collection.\n\nBut let\u2019s make sure LEFT is actually safe:\n\nMy body goes:\n(5,2) \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 (4,1) \u2192 (4,0) \u2192 ... continuing elsewhere.\nSo (4,3) is not part of the body currently.\n\nEnemy snake is at (0,1) and poses no immediate threat.\n\nTherefore, LEFT to (4,3) is safe and gains an apple.\n\nIt's also the most strategic near-term move with no downside.\n\nNo risk of getting trapped.\n\nAfter LEFT, I\u2019ll be at (4,3) \u2014 still central and flexible for next move:\n- UP to (4,4)\n- DOWN to (4,2)\n- LEFT to (3,3) \u2014 away from body\n- RIGHT to (5,3) \u2014 back where I came from\n\nAll remain safe and mobile.\n\nThis will bring my score to 20 apples.\n\nVery strong move.\n\nFinal decision:\n\n**LEFT**\n\nPlan ahead:  \nAfter taking (4, 3), assess for next apple targets like (8, 1) or (9, 3). Watch enemy movement and avoid head-on collisions. Retain central mobility.\n\nLEFT",

The enemy's possible moves (LEFT to (4,3) or RIGHT to (6,3)) don't overlap with (0,1). No collision risk.  \n\n### Key Considerations:  \nLEFT is the only safe move. It avoids immediate collision, keeps the snake alive, and maintains options for future moves.  \n\nLong-term plan: After moving left, continue prioritizing paths away from the enemy (which is currently at (5,3) with a long body extending down and right) and toward accessible apples like (8,1) or (0,2). Maintain flexibility by avoiding tight spaces that could trap the snake.  \n\nLEFT",
