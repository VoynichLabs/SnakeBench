All are safe for them currently.  \n\nWe need to avoid moving into a cell where enemy could also move if we think they might go there and collide head-on. But currently no overlap between my safe moves and their possible moves except if they move many steps away \u2014 not relevant now.  \n\n**Choosing between DOWN and LEFT:**  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,8) \u2014 moves toward center, closer to apples (6,7) is 3 steps away in Manhattan distance (|9-6|+|8-7|=3+1=4 actually), wait: from (9,8) to (6,7) = |3|+|1|=4.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,9) \u2014 also toward center, to (6,7) = |2|+|2|=4 same distance.  \n\nBut (8,9) is closer to apple (6,7) in x-direction, but (9,8) is closer in y-direction. Both equally good in distance.  \n\nConsider future safe moves:  \nFrom (9,8): possible next moves: UP (back to (9,9)), DOWN (9,7), LEFT (8,8), RIGHT off board. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \nFrom (8,9): possible next moves: UP off board, DOWN (8,8), LEFT (7,9), RIGHT (9,9). So 3 safe moves next turn too.  \n\nBut (8,9) is slightly better because it\u2019s closer to more apples (6,4), (6,7), (3,7), (1,4), (1,1) in terms of average distance. Actually (9,8) is closer to (6,7) than (8,9) is? Check:  \n(9,8) to (6,7): dx=3, dy=1 \u2192 4 steps.  \n(8,9) to (6,7): dx=2, dy=2 \u2192 4 steps. Same.  \n\nBut (9,8) to (6,4): dx=3, dy=4 \u2192 7 steps.  \n(8,9) to (6,4): dx=2, dy=5 \u2192 7 steps. Same.  \n\nSo no significant difference. Let\u2019s pick **LEFT** because moving away from the right edge gives slightly more space long-term.  \n\nPlan for next turns: Move toward nearest apple while avoiding enemy\u2019s possible path; enemy is far away at (5,5), so safe for now.  \n\nLEFT",

Which move gets me closer to (6, 7)?**  \nFrom (8, 8):  \n- UP (8, 9) \u2192 dist to (6, 7) = |2| + |2| = 4 (worse than current 3)  \n- DOWN (8, 7) \u2192 dist = |2| + |0| = 2 \u2705  \n- LEFT (7, 8) \u2192 dist = |1| + |1| = 2 \u2705  \n- RIGHT (9, 8) \u2192 dist = |3| + |1| = 4 (worse)  \n\nSo DOWN and LEFT both reduce distance equally.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Future safe moves after each:**  \nFrom (8, 7): moves: UP (8, 8), DOWN (8, 6), LEFT (7, 7), RIGHT (9, 7) \u2014 all 4 safe.  \nFrom (7, 8): moves: UP (7, 9), DOWN (7, 7), LEFT (6, 8), RIGHT (8, 8) \u2014 all 4 safe.  \n\nActually both have 4 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**7. Consider enemy movement:**  \nEnemy likely wants apple at (6, 4) (directly below them) or maybe (5, 3) or (6, 7).  \nThey are at (6, 4), apple at (6, 4) is gone (not listed \u2014 wait, apples list includes (6, 4)? Actually apples listed: (1,4), (6,7), (3,7), (1,1), (5,3). No (6,4) apple now. So they might move toward (5, 3) or (6, 7).  \n\nIf they move toward (6, 7): they\u2019d go UP? They can\u2019t go UP into body, so they\u2019d go LEFT to (5,4) then UP? That\u2019s two moves.  \n\nWe want to reach (6, 7) before them. They\u2019re at (6, 4), we\u2019re at (8, 8). We need to move DOWN then LEFT twice, or LEFT then DOWN etc.  \n\nLet\u2019s check:  \nFrom (8, 8):  \n- DOWN (8, 7) \u2192 then LEFT (7, 7) \u2192 then LEFT (6, 7) eats apple in 3 moves.  \n- LEFT (7, 8) \u2192 then DOWN (7, 7) \u2192 then LEFT (6, 7) eats apple in 3 moves.  \n\nSame distance.  \n\n---\n\n**8. Tie-breaker: centralizing / avoiding edges:**  \n(8, 8) is near top-right corner. Moving DOWN or LEFT both move toward center.  \n\nBut moving DOWN to (8, 7) keeps x=8 (still right edge). Moving LEFT to (7, 8) gets off right edge slightly better.  \n\nAlso, enemy is at (6, 4) \u2014 if they move toward (6, 7), they\u2019d need to go LEFT then UP then UP (can\u2019t go UP first turn). So we have time.  \n\n---\n\n**9. Plan for next turns:**  \nI\u2019ll move DOWN now to (8, 7) to reduce y-distance to apple (6, 7) to 0, then next turn move LEFT toward it. This also avoids moving parallel to enemy\u2019s possible path immediately.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Apple at (6, 7) is two moves away for enemy (UP blocked by body first turn).  \nEnemy could move LEFT to (5, 3), then UP to (5, 4), then UP to (5, 5), etc. Not directly toward (6, 7) quickly.  \nWe can reach (6, 7) in two moves from (8, 7): LEFT to (7, 7), then LEFT to (6, 7).  \n\nBut enemy could move LEFT to (5, 3) toward apple (5, 3), or DOWN to (6, 2), etc. They\u2019re not an immediate threat to (6, 7).  \n\n---\n\n**8. Check for traps:**  \nAll moves safe now, but moving LEFT gets me closer to apple and off right edge, which is good for future options.  \n\n---\n\n**9.

Possible moves from (6,7):**  \n- UP \u2192 (6,8) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,7) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,7) \u2192 my own body \u274c  \n\nSo RIGHT is invalid. UP, DOWN, LEFT are safe.\n\n---\n\n**2.

Risk of head-on collision:**  \nEnemy can\u2019t reach my possible moves in one step from (4,3). My safe moves are (6,8), (6,6), (5,7). Enemy\u2019s reachable cells: (4,4), (4,2), (3,3). No overlap \u2192 no immediate head-on collision risk.\n\n---\n\n**4. Apple proximity from (6,7):**  \n- (3,7): dist = |3| + |0| = 3  \n- (1,9): dist = |5| + |2| = 7  \n- (1,4): dist = |5| + |3| = 8  \n- (6,1): dist = |0| + |6| = 6  \n- (1,1): dist = |5| + |6| = 11  \n\nClosest is (3,7), three steps to the left.  \nFrom (6,7), moving LEFT to (5,7) reduces distance to (3,7) to 2 steps.  \nUP or DOWN keep distance at 3 or increase it.\n\n---\n\n**5. Future safe moves after each candidate:**  \nIf I go LEFT to (5,7):  \nNext turn head at (5,7), body = [(6,7), (7,7)] (tail at (7,7)).  \nFrom (5,7) possible moves: UP (5,8), DOWN (5,6), LEFT (4,7), RIGHT (6,7) but (6,7) will be my body next turn \u2192 so RIGHT invalid. So 3 moves open, fine.\n\nIf I go UP to (6,8):  \nNext turn head at (6,8), body = [(6,7), (7,7)].  \nFrom (6,8): UP (6,9), DOWN (6,7) body \u274c, LEFT (5,8), RIGHT (7,8). So 3 moves open.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (6,6):  \nNext turn head at (6,6), body = [(6,7), (7,7)].  \nFrom (6,6): UP (6,7) body \u274c, DOWN (6,5), LEFT (5,6), RIGHT (7,6). So 3 moves open.\n\nAll give 3 safe next moves.\n\n---\n\n**6. Enemy\u2019s path to apples:**  \nEnemy at (4,3) is far from (3,7) (distance 4). They might go for (1,4) or (6,1) sooner.  \n(6,1) is 5 steps from enemy, 6 steps from me if I go DOWN now, so not urgent.\n\n---\n\n**7. Plan for next few turns:**  \nBest to move toward nearest apple (3,7). That means LEFT now.  \nAfter (5,7), next turn go LEFT again to (4,7), then to (3,7) to eat it.  \nNeed to watch enemy\u2019s movement \u2014 they might move up toward (3,7) eventually, but currently they are 4 steps away, I\u2019ll be 2 steps away after this move. So I can likely get it before them.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT toward apple (3,7), safe, reduces distance to nearest apple, keeps options open.\n\nLEFT",

Check possible moves from (3, 7):**  \n\n- **UP** \u2192 (3, 8) \u2013 empty on board, not my body, not enemy body.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3, 6) \u2013 empty on board, not my body, not enemy body.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2, 7) \u2013 empty on board, not my body, not enemy body.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 7) \u2013 my own body segment \u2192 illegal (self-collision).  \n\nSo RIGHT is eliminated immediately.\n\n---\n\n**2. Check for possible head-on collisions with enemy snake #1**  \nEnemy head at (4, 6). Their possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (4, 7) \u2013 my body, they die if they go there, but that\u2019s not a head-on collision unless I go there too.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4, 5) \u2013 their own body \u2192 illegal for them.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3, 6) \u2013 possible for them.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5, 6) \u2013 empty.  \n\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (3, 6), and I move DOWN to (3, 6), we collide head-on \u2192 both die.  \nSo **DOWN** is risky if enemy chooses LEFT this turn.  \n\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 6) or UP to (4, 7) (suicide), no conflict with my possible moves.  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (3, 6), only my DOWN is dangerous.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Apples proximity:**  \nApples:  \n- (1, 4) \u2013 far, y=4, x=1  \n- (1, 1) \u2013 far  \n- (6, 1) \u2013 far  \n- (1, 9) \u2013 top left, far  \n- (1, 2) \u2013 far  \n\nNo apple is very close to (3, 7).  \nClosest by Manhattan distance: (1, 9) \u2192 dist = |3-1|+|7-9| = 2+2=4.  \n(1, 4) \u2192 dist = 2+3=5.  \n\nMoving LEFT to (2, 7) gets closer to (1, 9)? Actually (1, 9) is up-left. LEFT alone doesn\u2019t reduce y-distance. UP reduces y-distance faster.  \n\nFrom (3, 7):  \n- UP (3, 8) \u2192 dist to (1, 9) = 2+1=3  \n- LEFT (2, 7) \u2192 dist = 1+2=3 (same)  \n- DOWN (3, 6) \u2192 dist = 2+3=5  \n\nSo UP or LEFT are equally close to (1, 9), but UP also opens top area.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Future options after each safe move:**  \n\n- **UP** to (3, 8):  \n  Adjacent cells next turn: UP (3, 9), DOWN (3, 7) (current head pos, now empty), LEFT (2, 8), RIGHT (4, 8). All seem free except maybe enemy moves.  \n\n- **LEFT** to (2, 7):  \n  Adjacent cells next turn: UP (2, 8), DOWN (2, 6), LEFT (1, 7), RIGHT (3, 7) (empty now).  \n\n- **DOWN** to (3, 6):  \n  Risk of head-on collision if enemy goes LEFT to (3, 6). Also from (3, 6) next turn: UP back to (3, 7), DOWN (3, 5), LEFT (2, 6), RIGHT (4, 6) (enemy head now).  \n\nDOWN seems more limiting and risky.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy at (4, 6) could go LEFT to (3, 6), so if I go DOWN we both die. That\u2019s a 25% chance they pick that direction (assuming random safe moves for them). But I should avoid that risk since I\u2019m leading in apples? Actually scores tied 2\u20132.  \n\nBetter to avoid gambling.  \n\nSo eliminate DOWN for safety.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Choose between UP and LEFT:**  \nBoth safe, no immediate collision possible with enemy\u2019s possible moves except DOWN (already eliminated).  \n\nUP gives more central access and moves toward apple (1, 9).  \nLEFT moves toward apple (1, 9) equally well but into left edge.  \n\nBeing near the edge reduces future moves slightly, but not yet a problem.  \n\nI\u2019ll pick **UP** for more open space next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan:** Move toward (1, 9) while avoiding risky collisions. Keep enemy head in mind\u2014they may move toward apples at (1, 4) or (1, 2) soon.  \n\n---\n\nUP",

Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple: (1, 9) \u2013 Manhattan distance from (2, 8) = |2-1| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2.  \nFrom (2, 8):  \n- UP (2, 9) \u2192 distance to (1, 9) = 1 + 0 = 1  \n- DOWN (2, 7) \u2192 distance = 1 + 2 = 3  \n- LEFT (1, 8) \u2192 distance = 0 + 1 = 1  \n\nBoth UP and LEFT reduce distance equally well toward (1, 9).  \nOther apples are farther.\n\n---\n\n**4. Future options after each move:**  \n- **UP to (2, 9):**  \n  Next turn adjacents: UP off board (illegal), DOWN (2, 8) (empty), LEFT (1, 9) (apple), RIGHT (3, 9) (empty).  \n  3 safe moves next turn unless enemy interferes.\n\n- **LEFT to (1, 8):**  \n  Next turn adjacents: UP (1, 9) (apple), DOWN (1, 7) (empty), LEFT off board (illegal), RIGHT (2, 8) (empty).  \n  3 safe moves next turn.\n\n- **DOWN to (2, 7):**  \n  Next turn adjacents: UP (2, 8) (empty), DOWN (2, 6) (empty), LEFT (1, 7) (empty), RIGHT (3, 7) (my old tail, will be empty).  \n  4 safe moves next turn, but moves away from closest apple.\n\n---\n\n**5. Enemy movement consideration:**  \nEnemy at (6, 6) might move UP toward top area eventually, but currently far. They could move RIGHT toward (6, 1) apple. No immediate threat to me.\n\n---\n\n**6. Choose between UP and LEFT:**  \nBoth safe, same apple distance reduction.  \nUP puts me at (2, 9), next turn I can go LEFT to apple (1, 9).  \nLEFT puts me at (1, 8), next turn I can go UP to apple (1, 9).  \nBoth achieve apple in two turns, but UP now means I\u2019m on top edge, which slightly reduces future flexibility after eating apple.  \nLEFT now keeps me off edges longer, giving slightly more options next turn (can go DOWN/UP/RIGHT from (1, 8) after eating apple, whereas from (2, 9) after eating apple I\u2019d be at (1, 9) with only DOWN and RIGHT available).  \n\nI\u2019ll take **LEFT** to preserve more future flexibility while still progressing toward closest apple.\n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan:**  \nMove toward apple (1, 9), eat it next turn, then consider moving downward toward other apples while keeping an eye on enemy movement from lower right.\n\nLEFT",

Immediate danger check:**  \nNo other snake body at (1, 9), (1, 7), or (0, 8).  \nEnemy head at (6, 5), far away. No direct collision possible unless they move many steps toward me this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple: (1, 9) is at Manhattan distance 1 from my head.  \n- UP \u2192 onto apple \u2192 eat and grow.  \nEating apple means next turn my tail stays longer, so my body will be [(1, 9), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8)] after moving.  \n\nOther apples: (1, 4), (1, 2), (1, 1) are in column 1 below me; (6, 1) is far right bottom; (1, 9) is top left.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Safety after eating apple:**  \nIf I go UP to (1, 9) and eat it:  \nNext turn from (1, 9):  \n- UP \u2192 off board \u2192 illegal.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 my body (segment 2) \u2192 illegal.  \n- LEFT \u2192 off board \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 9) \u2192 empty.  \n\nThat leaves only **RIGHT** as possible move next turn!

Compare safe moves:**  \nUP \u2192 immediate apple but trapped next turn (only RIGHT available).  \nDOWN \u2192 no apple now, but safer future options.  \nLEFT \u2192 no apple now, safer future options.  \n\nTrapping myself after eating apple is risky if enemy approaches later \u2014 but enemy is far now. Still, being forced into only one move next turn could be fatal if that move leads to another trap.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Check enemy possible moves:**  \nEnemy at (6, 5): possible moves UP (6, 6) own body? Wait, their body: [(6, 6), (5, 6)] so (6, 6) is their body segment 1 \u2192 illegal. So enemy cannot go UP.  \nEnemy can go: DOWN (6, 4), LEFT (5, 5), RIGHT (7, 5).  \nNo overlap with my possible moves this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**7. Long-term planning:**  \nI have 2 apples, enemy has 2 apples. Game is early.  \nBetter to stay flexible than lock into a trap.  \nSo avoid UP now despite apple \u2014 too dangerous.  \n\nBetween DOWN and LEFT:  \nLEFT (0, 8) \u2192 edge reduces options slightly but still 2 moves next turn.  \nDOWN (1, 7) \u2192 more central, 2 moves next turn, closer to column 1 apples below.  \n\nI prefer DOWN to stay near apples (1, 4), (1, 2), (1, 1) while keeping flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n**Short-term plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1, 7), I can go DOWN toward apples or RIGHT to avoid being too predictable. Avoid trapping myself on edges. Enemy likely heading toward (6, 1) apple \u2014 not an immediate threat to me.  \n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Would die.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (1, 4) \u2192 That\u2019s an apple. Check safety:  \n    - Not off board.  \n    - Not my body (my body at (1,6), (1,7)).  \n    - Not enemy body? Enemy body: [(6,3), (6,4)]. Not overlapping.  \n    - Possible head-on collision? Enemy head at (5,3). Could enemy move to (1,4)? No, too far (they\u2019d need 4 left moves). So safe from that.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0, 5) \u2192 Empty cell, safe from self and enemy body.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 5) \u2192 Empty cell, safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Strategic thoughts:**  \n- DOWN gets apple immediately, grows to length 4. But after eating apple at (1,4), my body will be [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)]? Wait, careful: when you eat apple, you grow by adding new head at apple cell, old body stays same length. Actually: current: head (1,5), body (1,6),(1,7). If move DOWN to (1,4) apple: new head at (1,4), old head becomes body segment 1, old body shifts down: new body = [(1,5), (1,6), (1,7), ???] no, that\u2019s wrong \u2014 standard snake: you move head to new cell, if apple there, tail doesn\u2019t move that turn (grow by 1). So new body = [(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)] length 4. Yes.  \n- Eating apple is good for score, but check future mobility: after moving to (1,4), my body occupies (1,4)-(1,7) vertical strip. My head at (1,4), possible moves next turn: UP to (1,5) my body \u2192 no. LEFT (0,4) free. RIGHT (2,4) free. DOWN (1,3) free. So 3 moves possible. That\u2019s fine.  \n\n- LEFT to (0,5): no apple, but safe. Next turn from (0,5): possible moves: UP (0,6) free, DOWN (0,4) free, RIGHT back to (1,5) body? Wait, after moving LEFT to (0,5), my body becomes [(0,5), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)]? No \u2014 I didn\u2019t eat apple, so tail moves: current body (1,6),(1,7) \u2192 remove tail (1,7), add new head (0,5), so body = [(0,5), (1,5), (1,6)]. Yes. Then next turn from (0,5): UP (0,6) free, DOWN (0,4) free, RIGHT (1,5) is my body segment (old head) \u2192 not allowed. So only UP/DOWN possible \u2014 only 2 moves. That\u2019s riskier.  \n\n- RIGHT to (2,5): no apple. Next turn from (2,5): body = [(2,5), (1,5), (1,6)], tail removed (1,7). Moves: UP (2,6) free, DOWN (2,4) free, LEFT (1,5) my body \u2192 no, RIGHT (3,5) free \u2192 3 moves possible.  \n\nSo LEFT gives fewer options next turn.  \n\n**Enemy snake #1** at (5,3), body (6,3),(6,4). Apples at (1,1), (1,2), (6,1), (1,9), (1,4). They might go for (6,1) by moving DOWN to (5,2)? Or LEFT to (4,3)? Not threatening me directly.  \n\n**Best move:** DOWN gets apple, increases score, keeps decent mobility next turn. Avoids trapping myself.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (1,4) after eating apple, avoid going up into own body. Consider moving LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN to explore toward other apples (1,2) or (1,1) but careful not to trap self.  \n\n**Final choice:**  \n\nDOWN",

Wait, growth happens after eating apple: new segment added at tail position at the end of the turn (so length becomes 5).  \n- Future moves from (1, 2): possible moves: UP back to (1, 3) (occupied by my new neck), LEFT (0, 2), RIGHT (2, 2), DOWN (1, 1) apple there too but careful: (1, 1) is apple now, but if I go DOWN again next turn, is it safe?

Eating apple also extends my body but that\u2019s fine.  \n\nAlso, (1, 2) to (1, 1) next turn could get another apple if safe.

Thus, I prefer going DOWN to get closer to those.\n\nTherefore, I will go DOWN.\n\nLong-term plan: Continue to move towards (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 0), while being wary of the enemy snake. Try to position defensively to avoid head-on collisions. Also, monitor the apple at (6, 1). I can also consider going towards the upper left (1,9) region in later moves.\n\nDOWN",

Length 4.  \n**Enemy snake #1:** Head at (3,2), body at [(4,2), (4,3), (4,4)]. Length 4.  \n\nApples: (1,1), (6,1), (1,9), (1,2), (2,0).  \n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Possible moves from (2,1)**  \n\n- **UP** \u2192 (2,2): That\u2019s my own body segment (second segment). Invalid (suicide).  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2,0): Contains an apple. No snake body there. On board. Safe? Need to check if enemy could move there simultaneously.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1,1): Contains an apple. No snake body there. On board.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,1): Empty, no apple. On board.  \n\nSo immediately **UP** is eliminated.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Check enemy possible moves**  \nEnemy head at (3,2). Their possible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (3,3): empty, safe for them.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (3,1): empty, but that\u2019s my possible RIGHT move.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (2,2): my body segment \u2192 they\u2019d die if they go there.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (4,2): their own body segment \u2192 suicide for them.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, DOWN. They won\u2019t choose suicide moves unless they\u2019re forced, but we must assume they\u2019ll avoid death. So likely they\u2019ll choose UP or DOWN.  \n\nIf enemy chooses DOWN to (3,1), and I choose RIGHT to (3,1), head-on collision \u2192 both die. That\u2019s risky.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate my safe moves**  \n\n**DOWN to (2,0):**  \n- Eats apple \u2192 grow to length 5 next turn.  \n- Next turn my body will be at [(2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3)] \u2192 head at (2,0), tail at (1,3).  \n- From (2,0), possible moves next turn: UP (back to (2,1) which will be my body next turn \u2014 suicide), LEFT (1,0) empty, RIGHT (3,0) empty. So only LEFT and RIGHT safe next turn \u2014 2 options.  \n- Collision risk this turn: enemy at (3,2) cannot reach (2,0) in one move, so no head-on risk. Safe from enemy head.  \n\n**LEFT to (1,1):**  \n- Eats apple \u2192 grow to length 5.  \n- Next turn my body: [(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3)]. Head at (1,1).  \n- From (1,1), possible moves: UP (1,2) empty (apple?), wait apple at (1,2) yes \u2014 but need to check if enemy can reach there. DOWN (1,0) empty, RIGHT (2,1) my body (suicide). So UP, DOWN safe = 2 options.  \n- Collision risk this turn: enemy cannot reach (1,1) in one move from (3,2). Safe.  \n\n**RIGHT to (3,1):**  \n- No apple.  \n- Next turn body: [(3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,3)]. Head at (3,1).  \n- From (3,1), possible moves: UP (3,2) \u2014 enemy currently at (3,2), but enemy moves this turn, so next turn (3,2) might be empty or occupied. If enemy moves UP to (3,3), then (3,2) empty. DOWN (3,0) empty, LEFT (2,1) my body (suicide), RIGHT (4,1) empty. So potentially UP, DOWN, RIGHT = 3 options next turn if enemy leaves (3,2). But risky this turn: if enemy moves DOWN to (3,1), head-on collision.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Compare moves**  \n\nRIGHT has head-on risk with enemy\u2019s DOWN move. Since enemy has two safe moves (UP, DOWN), probability they choose DOWN is 50% if random. That\u2019s too risky. So RIGHT is dangerous.  \n\nLEFT and DOWN both safe this turn, both eat apple, both give me 2 safe moves next turn. Which is better?  \n\nFrom (1,1) next turn: UP to (1,2) apple, DOWN to (1,0) empty.  \nFrom (2,0) next turn: LEFT to (1,0) empty, RIGHT to (3,0) empty.  \n\nSo LEFT now \u2192 next turn can eat apple at (1,2) if safe.  \nDOWN now \u2192 next turn no apple reachable in one move from (2,0).  \n\nLEFT seems slightly better because it keeps an apple reachable next move. Also, enemy might move toward (3,3) or (3,1), but (1,2) is farther from enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Long-term plan note**  \nFrom (1,1), after eating apple at (1,2), consider moving toward center to avoid trapping self in left column. Watch enemy head movements \u2014 they are to the right.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Eliminate lethal moves:\n    *   UP: (3, 2). This is lethal since it is my body.\n    *   DOWN: (3, 0). This is safe.\n    *   LEFT: (2, 1). This is possibly lethal with enemy moving right.\n    *   RIGHT: (4, 1). This is safe.\n\n2. Analyze remaining safe moves:\n    *   DOWN: (3, 0). The apples are clustered to the left at (1, 2) and (2, 0) and (1, 1). This moves me vaguely closer to these.\n    *   RIGHT: (4, 1). There is an apple at (6, 1). However, the area looks unsafe to the left and I would prefer the cluster.\n\nBecause of the clustered apples, moving LEFT seems like a good gamble versus DOWN or RIGHT.\nI need to re-evaluate LEFT because it may be lethal. If the enemy goes RIGHT, they move to (2, 1) which causes a head to head with me going LEFT to (2, 1). Thus going LEFT is not safe.\n\nI also reconsider an updated version of RIGHT: The enemy is at (1,1) and seems to want the apples near (1,x). Thus, staying to the right is a different strategic option than competing on the LEFT side of the board. I may have a better chance at long-term survival avoiding the other snake and picking off isolated apples.\n\nThus I must choose between DOWN and RIGHT. Given that apples are at (1,2), (2,0) and (6,1), moving right gives me more separation from the cluster occupied by the other snake.\n\nLong-term plan: Increase distance from the other snake (avoid the left side of the board). Acquire the apple at (6,1) and other uncontented apples. Monitor the enemy and the apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Check each direction for immediate death  \n\nFrom (1, 0):  \n\n- **UP** \u2192 (1, 1) \u2192 That\u2019s my own body segment \u2192 **Death** (hitting myself)  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (1, -1) \u2192 Off board \u2192 **Death**  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0, 0) \u2192 Empty on board (see board state at 0,0: it\u2019s empty) \u2192 **Safe** (no snakes there now)  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2, 0) \u2192 Apple (2,0) is there, but my body at (2,1) is not adjacent except vertically. Wait, check: (2,0) is not part of my body (body: (1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)). But enemy body? Snake #1 body: (3,1),(3,2),(4,2),(4,1) head. So (2,0) is free of enemy body. So **Safe** to move there.  \n\nSo safe moves: LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Consider enemy\u2019s possible moves and head-on collisions  \n\nEnemy head at (4,1).  \nPossible moves for enemy:  \n\nFrom (4,1):  \n- UP to (4,2) \u2192 its own body (4,2) \u2192 death for them  \n- DOWN to (4,0) \u2192 empty (safe for them)  \n- LEFT to (3,1) \u2192 its own body (3,1) \u2192 death for them  \n- RIGHT to (5,1) \u2192 empty (safe for them)  \n\nSo enemy safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nWhere will enemy go? They might go toward apples:  \n- Apple at (6,1) \u2192 RIGHT gets them closer.  \n- Apple at (1,2) \u2192 not close.  \n- Apple at (1,5) \u2192 not close.  \n\nLikely enemy moves RIGHT to (5,1) toward apple (6,1).  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Evaluate my safe moves:  \n\n**LEFT to (0,0)**  \n- No apples there.  \n- Next turn from (0,0): possible moves: UP to (0,1) (empty), RIGHT to (1,0) (empty now, but after I move, my old head is now body at (1,0)? Wait: my body after moving LEFT: new head (0,0), then old head (1,0) becomes body segment 2, then (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). So (1,0) will be my body next turn. So from (0,0), RIGHT next turn would hit myself.  \n- From (0,0), UP to (0,1) safe, DOWN off board, LEFT off board. So only 1 safe move next turn (UP). That\u2019s risky.  \n\n**RIGHT to (2,0)**  \n- Eat apple (2,0) \u2192 grow by 1, new tail stays where tail was? Actually growth: new head at apple, body gains segment at old tail position next turn.  \n- From (2,0) next turn: possible moves: UP to (2,1) \u2192 my body (old head at (1,0) will be body segment 2, but (2,1) is body segment 3 currently, will shift? Let\u2019s simulate:  \n\nCurrent: H(1,0) B(1,1) B(2,1) B(2,2) B(2,3)  \n\nMove RIGHT to (2,0) and eat apple:  \nNew body: H(2,0), B(1,0), B(1,1), B(2,1), B(2,2), B(2,3) (length 6).  \n\nSo next turn from (2,0):  \n- UP to (2,1) \u2192 that\u2019s my own body (segment 4 in new body) \u2192 death  \n- DOWN to (2,-1) \u2192 off board \u2192 death  \n- LEFT to (1,0) \u2192 my own body (segment 2) \u2192 death  \n- RIGHT to (3,0) \u2192 empty (safe)  \n\nSo only 1 safe move next turn (RIGHT to (3,0)). Also risky.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Compare risks  \n\nBoth safe moves lead to only 1 safe move next turn. But RIGHT gets an apple (score +1, length +1) and moves away from enemy.  \n\nLEFT gets no apple and puts me at (0,0) with only UP safe next turn, which is near enemy path possibly.  \n\nEnemy likely to move RIGHT to (5,1). My move RIGHT to (2,0) is far from enemy, no head-on risk.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Choose  \n\nRIGHT gets apple, increases score to 5, enemy at 3. Even if trapped next turn, maybe enemy dies somewhere else.  \n\nLEFT seems pointless.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (2,0) after eating apple, only safe move is RIGHT to (3,0). That\u2019s fine; then from (3,0) next turn, check UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT again. Might be able to go UP to (3,1) if enemy not there.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Check each direction for immediate death:**  \n\nFrom (2,0):  \n- **UP** \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 my body (segment 4 in current body) \u2192 **Death**.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (2,-1) \u2192 off board \u2192 **Death**.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (1,0) \u2192 my body (segment 2) \u2192 **Death**.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (3,0) \u2192 board empty, no enemy body there \u2192 **Safe**.  \n\nOnly safe move: **RIGHT**.  \n\n**2. Check enemy\u2019s possible moves:**  \n\nEnemy head at (5,1):  \n- UP (5,2): empty \u2192 safe.  \n- DOWN (5,0): empty \u2192 safe.  \n- LEFT (4,1): its own body \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT (6,1): apple at (6,1) \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\nLikely enemy moves toward apple (6,1) via RIGHT, or maybe (5,4) via UP later.  \n\n**3. My move consequences:**  \n\nRIGHT to (3,0):  \n- No apple there.  \n- New head at (3,0), body becomes: [(2,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)].  \n\nNext turn from (3,0):  \n- UP (3,1): currently enemy body? Yes, enemy body has (4,1) and (3,1). If enemy moves away from (3,1) this turn, it could be empty next turn, but we can\u2019t assume. Wait \u2014 (3,1) is part of enemy body now. Even if enemy moves, that segment will remain unless they grew last turn (they didn\u2019t eat apple last turn because no apple at (5,1)). Actually, enemy head was at (4,1) last turn, moved to (5,1) this turn (since our last move info shows enemy head at (5,1) now). So their body: (4,1) (3,1) (3,2) \u2014 so (3,1) is still there next turn regardless of where enemy moves now (since they didn\u2019t eat apple). So (3,1) is unsafe for me next turn.  \n- DOWN (3,-1): off board \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT (2,0): my own body (segment 2 next turn) \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT (4,0): empty now, but could enemy move there? From (5,1), enemy DOWN to (5,0), then LEFT to (4,0) would take 2 turns, so not this turn. So (4,0) will likely be safe next turn.  \n\nSo from (3,0) next turn, only safe move likely RIGHT to (4,0).  \n\n**4. Long-term outlook:**  \n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,0) avoids immediate death, but leaves me with only one safe move next turn (RIGHT to (4,0)). That\u2019s risky but unavoidable since other directions are fatal now.  \n\nFrom (4,0) next turn, I can go UP to (4,1) if enemy vacates it, or RIGHT to (5,0), etc. Might open up options.  \n\n**5. Plan for next turn:**  \n\nFrom (3,0), only RIGHT to (4,0) will be safe (unless enemy moves onto (4,0) this turn \u2014 unlikely). Then from (4,0), check again for apples and enemy position. Try to maneuver toward (5,4) apple later if possible.  \n\nRIGHT",

Long-term plan:**\nFrom (5, 0) next-next turn, I could go UP to (5, 1) (if enemy vacates), or RIGHT to (6, 0), etc. But (5, 1) is currently enemy body segment, but enemy might move away.\n\nGiven only RIGHT is safe now, I must take it.\n\n**Plan for next turn:**\nFrom (4, 0), likely only safe move is RIGHT to (5, 0). Then from (5, 0), check if UP to (5, 1) is safe (enemy body may have moved). Also consider path toward apple at (5, 4) via (5, 1) \u2192 (5, 2) \u2192 (5, 3) \u2192 (5, 4), but need to ensure enemy not blocking.\n\nRIGHT",

Need to check enemy possible moves.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,-1) \u2014 off board \u2192 **not safe**.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,0) \u2014 my own body segment \u2192 **not safe**.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,0) \u2014 empty currently, safe?  \n\nSo immediate elimination leaves UP and RIGHT as candidates.  \n\n**Enemy head at (5,4) possible moves:**  \n- UP \u2192 (5,5) \u2014 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,3) \u2014 enemy's own body \u2192 not safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,4) \u2014 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,4) \u2014 empty.  \n\nSo enemy can go UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Check for head-on collisions:**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (8,0), enemy cannot reach (8,0) from (5,4) in one move \u2192 safe.  \nIf I go UP to (7,1), enemy cannot reach (7,1) from (5,4) in one move \u2192 safe.  \n\n**Check for enemy moving into my body:**  \nMy body cells: (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), (2,0).  \nEnemy head at (5,4) moving LEFT \u2192 (4,4) not my body. UP \u2192 (5,5) not my body. RIGHT \u2192 (6,4) not my body. So no risk of enemy suicide into my body this turn.  \n\n**Check for enemy moving into my future head cell:**  \nIf I go UP to (7,1): enemy can go to (6,4), (5,5), (4,4) \u2014 none are (7,1). Safe.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (8,0): enemy can\u2019t reach (8,0). Safe.  \n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe immediately.  \n\n**Future options:**  \nFrom (7,1): possible next moves would be UP to (7,2), LEFT to (6,1), RIGHT to (8,1), DOWN to (7,0). DOWN is currently my neck (6,0) will be vacated this turn, but next turn my body will still be at (6,0)? Wait, body moves forward:  \nIf I move UP to (7,1), my body becomes: head (7,1), then (7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0), tail (2,0) stays? Actually, length 6 means after moving, last segment (tail) disappears, so body: [(7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0)] \u2014 so (2,0) is gone.  \n\nFrom (7,1):  \n- UP (7,2): empty now, safe unless enemy moves there next turn but can't predict perfectly.  \n- LEFT (6,1): currently enemy body? Enemy body at (6,1)? Yes, enemy body has (6,1) currently. But next turn enemy body moves, so maybe safe. But risky if enemy head goes to (6,1)? Let's see: enemy head at (5,4) can't reach (6,1) in one move. So (6,1) will be vacated (enemy body moves), but could be reoccupied by enemy head? No, enemy head can't be at (6,1) next turn unless teleport. So (6,1) will be empty next turn. So LEFT from (7,1) next turn might be safe.  \n- RIGHT (8,1): empty.  \n- DOWN (7,0): my own body next turn (current head becomes neck). So DOWN not safe next turn.  \n\nSo from (7,1), 3 possible moves next turn (UP, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\nFrom (8,0):  \n- UP (8,1): empty.  \n- RIGHT (9,0): empty but next to right wall, reduces future options.  \n- DOWN (8,-1): off board \u2192 not safe.  \n- LEFT (7,0): my own body next turn (neck).  \n\nSo from (8,0), only UP and RIGHT are possible next turn. That\u2019s fewer options.  \n\n**Closest apple:** Apples at (1,2), (1,5), (1,8), (1,9), (0,7). From (7,0), UP moves toward y=1, then eventually left toward column 1. UP is better for long-term pathing.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove UP now to (7,1). Next turn consider moving LEFT to (6,1) toward center and apples, but check enemy position then. Avoid being trapped near right edge.  \n\n**Final move:**  \nUP",

Check each direction for immediate death:\n\n**UP** \u2192 (7,3):  \n- On board? Yes.  \n- Into my body? No (my body cells: (7,1), (7,0), (6,0), (5,0), (4,0)).  \n- Into enemy body? Enemy body: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2). (7,3) not in that list.  \n- Safe for now.  \n\n**DOWN** \u2192 (7,1):  \n- On board? Yes.  \n- Into my body? Yes \u2014 (7,1) is my second segment.  \n- Not safe.  \n\n**LEFT** \u2192 (6,2):  \n- On board? Yes.  \n- Into my body? No.  \n- Into enemy body? Enemy body includes (6,2) \u2014 that\u2019s the enemy\u2019s tail segment. If I move there, I die immediately.  \n- Not safe.  \n\n**RIGHT** \u2192 (8,2):  \n- On board? Yes.  \n- Into my body? No.  \n- Into enemy body? No.  \n- Safe for now.  \n\nSo safe moves: **UP**, **RIGHT**.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Consider enemy\u2019s possible moves and head-on collisions:\n\nEnemy head at (5,6), body: (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3), (6,2).  \nFrom (5,6), enemy\u2019s safe moves:  \n- UP to (5,7): empty.  \n- DOWN to (5,5): into own body \u2192 no.  \n- LEFT to (4,6): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (6,6): empty.  \n\nSo enemy can move UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nMy possible moves:  \n- **UP to (7,3)**: enemy could go to (6,6), (5,7), (4,6) \u2014 none are (7,3). No head-on collision possible here.  \n- **RIGHT to (8,2)**: enemy can\u2019t reach (8,2) in one move from (5,6). No head-on collision possible here either.  \n\nSo both UP and RIGHT avoid head-on collisions.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Future options after each safe move:\n\n**UP to (7,3)**:  \nNext turn from (7,3):  \n- UP to (7,4): safe unless enemy moves there (enemy at (5,6) can\u2019t reach (7,4) in one move).  \n- DOWN to (7,2): currently empty, but my old head position \u2014 safe unless enemy moves there (enemy can\u2019t reach (7,2) from (5,6) in one move).  \n- LEFT to (6,3): enemy body currently at (6,3) \u2014 but enemy will move this turn, so (6,3) might become empty if enemy moves away. Wait \u2014 enemy\u2019s body segment at (6,3) is part of its body *now*, but if enemy moves UP from (5,6), its body shifts: head to (5,7), old head to body[0], old tail (6,2) disappears? Let\u2019s check: enemy body length is 6 (head + 5 segments). If enemy moves UP, new head (5,7), body becomes [(5,6), (5,5), (5,4), (5,3), (6,3)] \u2014 so (6,3) stays in enemy body (it\u2019s the last segment). So (6,3) is still enemy body next turn. So LEFT from (7,3) to (6,3) would be deadly next turn.  \n- RIGHT to (8,3): empty.  \n\nSo from (7,3) next turn safe moves likely: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (LEFT blocked by enemy body).  \n\n**RIGHT to (8,2)**:  \nNext turn from (8,2):  \n- UP to (8,3): empty.  \n- DOWN to (8,1): empty.  \n- LEFT to (7,2): empty (my old head).  \n- RIGHT to (9,2): empty but near right edge.  \n\nAll four possible next turn, but I\u2019m moving away from apples.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Apple proximity:\n\nApples: (1,9), (1,2), (1,5), (0,7), (1,8).  \nFrom (7,2):  \n- To (1,2): Manhattan distance = |7-1|+|2-2| = 6.  \n- To (1,5): |7-1|+|2-5| = 6+3=9.  \n- To (1,9): |7-1|+|2-9|=6+7=13.  \n- To (0,7): |7-0|+|2-7|=7+5=12.  \n- To (1,8): |7-1|+|2-8|=6+6=12.  \n\nClosest apple: (1,2) distance 6.  \n\nFrom (7,3): distance to (1,2) = |6|+|1| = 7 (worse).  \nFrom (8,2): distance to (1,2) = |7|+|0| = 7 (worse).  \n\nNeither safe move improves distance to closest apple, but UP gets me closer to apples at higher y like (1,5), (1,8), (1,9) maybe in fewer moves later because I can go left across top later.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Long-term positioning:\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (8,2), I\u2019m near right wall (x=9), which reduces future flexibility.  \nIf I go UP to (7,3), I\u2019m more central vertically, can go left toward apples next turn if enemy moves away from (6,3). But (6,3) is enemy body now and will remain so next turn if enemy moves UP (likely, since apples above). If enemy moves UP, then (6,3) stays occupied; if enemy moves LEFT or RIGHT, (6,3) might become free? Let\u2019s check:  \n- Enemy LEFT to (4,6): body becomes [(5,6),(5,5),(5,4),(5,3),(6,3)] \u2192 still (6,3) occupied.  \n- Enemy RIGHT to (6,6): body becomes [(5,6),(5,5),(5,4),(5,3),(6,3)] \u2192 still (6,3) occupied.  \n\nSo (6,3) is enemy body next turn regardless of enemy move (since it\u2019s the 5th segment from head and enemy length 6). So LEFT from (7,3) blocked next turn.  \n\nThat means from (7,3) I can go UP, RIGHT, DOWN. That\u2019s still okay.  \n\n---\n\nGiven enemy is far away at (5,6), I have time to maneuver. UP improves vertical position to reach apples on left side at y=5,8,9 later. RIGHT just edges me into a corner.  \n\n**Decision: UP** is better for long-term apple access while keeping options.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (7,3), avoid LEFT into (6,3) (enemy body). Consider UP to (7,4) or RIGHT to (8,3) to start moving leftward above enemy body. Aim toward apple at (1,5) or (1,8) by going across top rows (y=4+). Monitor enemy head movement to avoid future head-on collisions.  \n\nUP",

RIGHT puts me near right wall with fewer options to reach left-side apples later.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7,4), I'll have open options. I should start moving leftward toward apples while monitoring enemy movement. Avoid moving into (6,3) area since enemy body is there now and may linger. Next turn consider LEFT if safe, else UP or RIGHT to continue toward apples at y=5+.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:** UP is better for long-term apple access and keeps options open.\n\nUP",

Immediate safety from (7,4):\n\n**UP \u2192 (7,5):**  \n- On board: yes.  \n- Into my body? No.  \n- Into enemy body? Enemy body at (5,7),(5,6),(5,5),(5,4),(5,3) \u2192 (7,5) not there. Safe.\n\n**DOWN \u2192 (7,3):**  \n- On board: yes.  \n- Into my body? Yes, (7,3) is my second segment \u2192 unsafe.\n\n**LEFT \u2192 (6,4):**  \n- On board: yes.  \n- Into my body? No.  \n- Into enemy body? No. Safe.\n\n**RIGHT \u2192 (8,4):**  \n- On board: yes.  \n- Into my body? No.  \n- Into enemy body? No. Safe.\n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy possible moves from (5,8):\n\nEnemy safe moves from (5,8):  \n- UP to (5,9): empty.  \n- DOWN to (5,7): into own body \u2192 no.  \n- LEFT to (4,8): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (6,8): empty.  \nSo enemy can move UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nCheck head-on collisions:\n\nIf I choose **UP to (7,5)**: enemy possible heads next turn: (5,9), (4,8), (6,8) \u2192 none is (7,5). Safe.\n\nIf I choose **LEFT to (6,4)**: enemy possible heads: (5,9), (4,8), (6,8) \u2192 none is (6,4). Safe.\n\nIf I choose **RIGHT to (8,4)**: enemy possible heads: (5,9), (4,8), (6,8) \u2192 none is (8,4). Safe.\n\nSo all 3 safe moves avoid immediate head-on.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Future options after each safe move:\n\n**UP to (7,5):**  \nNext turn from (7,5):  \n- UP to (7,6): empty.  \n- DOWN to (7,4): empty (will be empty after I move).  \n- LEFT to (6,5): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (8,5): empty.  \nAll 4 moves open \u2192 good flexibility.\n\n**LEFT to (6,4):**  \nNext turn from (6,4):  \n- UP to (6,5): empty.  \n- DOWN to (6,3): empty (enemy body at (5,3) but (6,3) empty now).  \n- LEFT to (5,4): enemy body at (5,4) \u2192 would be unsafe next turn if enemy stays? Wait, enemy body currently includes (5,4), so (5,4) is occupied now and will remain occupied unless enemy moves entirely away (unlikely). So LEFT from (6,4) next turn to (5,4) would be into enemy body \u2192 reduces options.  \n- RIGHT to (7,4): empty (my old head).  \nSo 3 safe next moves, but one (LEFT) is likely blocked by enemy body.\n\n**RIGHT to (8,4):**  \nNext turn from (8,4):  \n- UP to (8,5): empty.  \n- DOWN to (8,3): empty.  \n- LEFT to (7,4): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (9,4): empty but edge.  \nAll 4 moves open, but moving rightward puts me farther from most apples.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Apple proximity:\n\nApples at (1,9), (1,2), (1,5), (0,7), (1,8).  \nFrom (7,4):  \n- (1,5): \u0394x=6, \u0394y=1 \u2192 dist 7  \n- (1,8): \u0394x=6, \u0394y=4 \u2192 dist 10  \n- (0,7): \u0394x=7, \u0394y=3 \u2192 dist 10  \n- (1,9): \u0394x=6, \u0394y=5 \u2192 dist 11  \n- (1,2): \u0394x=6, \u0394y=2 \u2192 dist 8\n\nFrom (7,5) after UP: slightly closer to y=9,8,7 apples, farther from y=5 apple.\n\nFrom (6,4) after LEFT: closer to all apples by 1 in x.\n\nFrom (8,4) after RIGHT: farther from apples.\n\nSo LEFT is best for reducing distance to apples.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Enemy\u2019s likely target:\n\nEnemy at (5,8) is close to apples (1,8), (0,7), (1,9). They will probably move UP/LEFT toward those. If I go LEFT to (6,4), I\u2019m moving toward apples (1,5) and (1,2), which enemy is not near. That seems like a safer apple route.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Risk of enemy moving into my chosen cell indirectly?\n\nEnemy\u2019s possible moves: (5,9), (4,8), (6,8). None conflict with my LEFT to (6,4) or UP to (7,5). So both safe.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nLEFT gets me closer to left-side apples while enemy is busy top-left. From (6,4), next turn I can go UP to (6,5) toward apple (1,5) or DOWN to (6,3) toward apple (1,2), depending on safety. Need to watch enemy body at (5,4) and (5,3) blocking my path leftward soon, so maybe after LEFT, go UP to avoid that.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:** LEFT is better for apple proximity and keeps options.\n\nLEFT",

That means enemy is far from me now and not an immediate threat.  \nApple (1,9) and (1,8) are near enemy; apple (1,5) and (1,2) are safer targets for me.\n\nIf I go UP toward (1,5), I stay more central and can later go left toward apples while avoiding enemy\u2019s area.  \nIf I go DOWN toward (1,2), I go closer to bottom edge, which might limit future upward movement later.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Long\u2011term plan note for next turns:  \nAfter moving UP to (6,5), next turn consider going LEFT if (5,5) is clear (enemy may have moved), else UP or RIGHT to stay safe while progressing toward left\u2011side apples. Avoid moving into column 5 while enemy body occupies it.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** UP gives slightly better apple proximity (targeting (1,5)) while keeping options open and staying away from enemy\u2019s current row.\n\nUP",

Long\u2011term plan note for next turns:\n\nAfter moving UP to (6,6), consider going LEFT to (5,6) only if enemy body has cleared (check if (5,6) is safe).

Actually (0,7) distance from (7,7) = 7 (same), (1,8) = 6 (same). Not a big gain.  \n\nDOWN to (7,5) \u2192 gets closer to (1,5) distance now 5, (1,2) distance 5.  \n\nRIGHT to (8,6) \u2192 distances increase for left-side apples.  \n\nSo DOWN seems best for apples.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Future options:**  \nFrom (7,5):  \nNext turn possible moves depend on enemy position after they move to (7,7).  \nEnemy at (7,7) blocks UP from (7,5)? No, UP from (7,5) is (7,6) which is empty after I move. So likely safe.  \n\nFrom (7,5): UP to (7,6) safe, DOWN to (7,4) my body? Wait my body after this turn:  \nIf I move DOWN to (7,5), new head (7,5), body becomes [(7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (7,4), (7,3)]? Actually I grow only if I eat an apple \u2014 no apple at (7,5), so length stays same, tail (7,3) drops, body: [(7,5), (7,6), (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), (7,4)]. Yes, so (7,4) is my body, so DOWN from (7,5) next turn would be into (7,4) my body \u2192 unsafe next turn.  \n\nThat means from (7,5) next turn, DOWN is blocked by own body.  \n\nCheck RIGHT from (7,5) \u2192 (8,5) empty. LEFT from (7,5) \u2192 (6,5) my body (yes, part of my body after move). So from (7,5) next turn safe moves: UP (7,6), RIGHT (8,5). Only two safe moves.  \n\nFrom (8,6) after moving RIGHT: next turn safe moves likely UP/DOWN/RIGHT (LEFT into (7,6) my body? Wait (7,6) will be my neck after move, yes my body). So from (8,6) safe: UP (8,7), DOWN (8,5), RIGHT (9,6). Three safe moves.  \n\nSo RIGHT keeps more options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Long-term plan note:**  \nEnemy is now at (7,7) if they move RIGHT as predicted. I\u2019ll be at (8,6) if I choose RIGHT. That gives space to maneuver toward top apples (1,9),(1,8),(0,7) via UP then LEFT carefully, or go DOWN later for (1,5),(1,2). Avoid moving toward enemy head unless necessary. Keep escape routes.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP risks head\u2011on collision (enemy\u2019s only safe move is into (7,7)).  \nDOWN reduces future safe moves to only two next turn.  \nRIGHT avoids collision, keeps three safe moves next turn, and while not closer to apples immediately, maintains flexibility.  \n\nSafety first \u2192 RIGHT.  \n\nRIGHT",

If I go DOWN to (8,5), enemy could go UP to (7,8) or RIGHT to (8,7). If enemy goes RIGHT to (8,7), they\u2019re closer to top apples but away from me. I\u2019ll be at (8,5) near lower apples (1,5),(1,2). That\u2019s good\u2014I can collect those while enemy goes for top apples, reducing conflict.  \n\nAlso, going DOWN avoids immediate head-on risk and keeps options open.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nUP risky (possible head-on).  \nRIGHT reduces future options.  \nDOWN safe, improves apple proximity, keeps 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n**Plan for next turn:** From (8,5), consider moving LEFT toward column 7 area to approach apples (1,5) or (1,2), while watching enemy\u2019s position.

Avoid boxing myself in. Keep an eye on enemy\u2019s position\u2014they\u2019re currently far north.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT: risky next turn (only 1 safe move).  \nRIGHT: okay but fewer options than DOWN.  \nDOWN: safest now, keeps 3 options next turn, still allows future apple collection.\n\nDOWN",

Possible moves from there:  \n- UP \u2192 (8, 10) out of bounds \u2192 invalid.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8, 8) \u2192 its own body (second segment) \u2192 invalid.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7, 9) \u2192 empty (board shows nothing there) \u2705  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9, 9) \u2192 empty \u2705  \n\nSo enemy can go LEFT or RIGHT safely.\n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (7, 9):  \nMy move UP to (7, 5) is safe.  \nMy move DOWN to (7, 3) safe.  \nMy move LEFT to (6, 4) safe.\n\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (9, 9): same safety for me.\n\nNo direct collision possible.\n\n---\n\n**Future options:**  \nFrom (7, 5): neighbors: (7, 6) is my body \u2192 blocked UP later. (8, 5) my body, (6, 5) free, (7, 4) free (but was head last turn, now empty). So from (7, 5), possible next moves: DOWN (back), LEFT, RIGHT? Wait, RIGHT is (8, 5) my body \u2192 no. So from (7, 5), only DOWN and LEFT possible next turn. That\u2019s risky (only 2 moves).\n\nFrom (7, 3): neighbors: (7, 4) empty, (7, 2) empty, (6, 3) empty, (8, 3) empty \u2192 all 4 possible next turn. Good flexibility.\n\nFrom (6, 4): neighbors: (6, 5) empty? Wait, (6, 5) is empty (check board: column 6 row 5 is empty), (6, 3) empty, (5, 4) empty, (7, 4) empty \u2192 also 4 possible next turn. Good flexibility.\n\nSo UP is bad (traps me next turn), DOWN and LEFT both good for future mobility.\n\n---\n\n**Closer to apples?**  \nFrom (7, 4):  \n- DOWN to (7, 3): moves away from (1, 5) slightly (y distance increases from 1 to 2).  \n- LEFT to (6, 4): moves closer to (1, 5) in x (6 vs 7), same y distance.  \nLEFT slightly better for apple direction.\n\nAlso, enemy is far away in top right, so no immediate danger.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nMove toward (1, 5) gradually while keeping space. Avoid going up into my own body line. Prefer LEFT or DOWN now.\n\nLEFT gives more options next turn and moves toward apples.\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

I\u2019m far away (y distance at least 4), so no immediate danger.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI want to gradually approach the apple cluster at left side (x=0,1). UP to (6, 5) is good because (1, 5) is at y=5, so moving to y=5 aligns with it. Then next turn I can go LEFT toward it. Also, staying away from enemy who\u2019s moving left along top row.\n\nUP seems slightly better than LEFT because:  \n- From (6, 5), next turn I can go LEFT to (5, 5) still closer to apple.  \n- From (5, 4), next turn going UP to (5, 5) also possible, but (5, 4) to (1, 5) is same as (6, 5) to (1, 5) in distance next step.  \n- But UP avoids moving toward enemy\u2019s possible future path down from (6, 9) later.\n\nI\u2019ll choose UP.\n\n---\n\nUP",

Wait (6, 5) is my current head, but after move it\u2019s my body\u2019s second segment? Let\u2019s check:  \nAfter moving UP, my body becomes [(6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (8, 5)] (tail at (8, 5) because we grew? Actually we didn\u2019t eat apple this turn so length stays same, tail moves from (8, 6) to (7, 4)? Let\u2019s trace:  \nCurrent: [(6,5), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6)] length 6.  \nMove UP: new head (6,6), rest shift: (6,5), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5) \u2192 tail (8,5). Yes.  \nSo (6,5) is my body next turn, so from (6,6), DOWN to (6,5) is blocked.  \nOther neighbors: (5,6) empty, (7,6) empty.  \nSo possible moves from (6,6) next turn: UP (6,7), LEFT (5,6), RIGHT (7,6) \u2192 3 options. Good.\n\nFrom (5, 5):  \nAfter moving LEFT, body: [(5,5), (6,5), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5)], tail (8,5).  \nNeighbors: (5,6) empty, (5,4) empty, (4,5) empty, (6,5) my body \u274c.  \nSo 3 options next turn.\n\nFrom (7, 5):  \nAfter moving RIGHT, body: [(7,5), (6,5), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (8,5)], tail (8,5).  \nNeighbors: (7,6) empty, (7,4) my body \u274c, (6,5) my body \u274c, (8,5) my body \u274c \u2192 only UP (7,6) available next turn! That\u2019s bad \u2014 could trap me.\n\nSo RIGHT is risky for future mobility.\n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple from (6,5):  \n- (1,5): distance = |6-1| + |5-5| = 5  \n- (1,2): distance = 5 + 3 = 8  \n- (1,9): 5 + 4 = 9  \n- (0,7): 6 + 2 = 8  \n- (1,8): 5 + 3 = 8  \n\nFrom possible moves:  \nUP to (6,6): to (1,5) = 5 + 1 = 6 \u2192 farther.  \nLEFT to (5,5): to (1,5) = 4 + 0 = 4 \u2192 closer.  \nRIGHT to (7,5): to (1,5) = 6 + 0 = 6 \u2192 farther.\n\nSo LEFT gets me closer to (1,5).\n\n---\n\n**Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy at (6,9) can move DOWN to (6,8) or LEFT to (5,9).  \nIf enemy goes DOWN to (6,8), it\u2019s closer to me if I go UP to (6,6) \u2014 Manhattan distance 2.  \nIf enemy goes LEFT to (5,9), distance to my LEFT target (5,5) is 4 in y, 0 in x \u2192 4 apart, safe.\n\nGiven enemy length 6 same as mine, head-on collision would kill both, so I avoid moving toward it.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT is bad (only 1 move next turn).  \nUP is okay but moves away from closest apple and slightly toward enemy if enemy moves DOWN.  \nLEFT is best: closer to apple, good mobility next turn (3 options), away from enemy.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (5,5), aim for apple (1,5) by moving LEFT over next few turns, while keeping an eye on enemy movement along top rows.\n\nLEFT",

Possible moves from (1,5):\n- **UP** \u2192 (1,6) \u2013 empty on board, not my body, not enemy body.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (1,4) \u2013 empty on board, safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (0,5) \u2013 empty, safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (2,5) \u2013 occupied by my own body (segment right behind head), so death.  \n\nSo **RIGHT** is eliminated immediately.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Check for immediate death from enemy collisions:\nEnemy head at (4,8) can move:  \n- UP \u2192 (4,9) \u2013 its own body, dies (so unlikely enemy picks that).  \n- DOWN \u2192 (4,7) \u2013 safe for them.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (3,8) \u2013 safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (5,8) \u2013 its own body, dies.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s possible safe moves: DOWN to (4,7) and LEFT to (3,8).  \n\nMy possible moves:  \n- If I go UP to (1,6): enemy is at (4,8), no overlap possible. Safe.  \n- If I go DOWN to (1,4): safe.  \n- If I go LEFT to (0,5): safe.  \n\nNo head-on collision possible this turn (enemy too far).  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple proximity and future options:\n- Apple at (1,2) is closest in vertical distance (3 steps down).  \n- Apple at (5,6) is 5 steps away (requires going right/up).  \n- Apples at (1,8), (1,9), (0,7) are above but enemy is near them.  \n\nEnemy is closer to (1,9), (1,8), (0,7). If I race for those, I\u2019d risk being cut off or head-on later. Better to secure (1,2) safely while enemy is busy above.  \n\nFrom (1,5):  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 then (1,3) \u2192 then (1,2) apple. That\u2019s 2 moves to reach it.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0,5) \u2192 then down toward (0,2) area, but apple at (1,2) would require moving right again later \u2014 less direct.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Future move safety after each option:\n**UP (1,6):**  \nNext moves from (1,6): UP to (1,7) (empty), DOWN back to (1,5) (body), LEFT to (0,6) (empty), RIGHT to (2,6) (empty).  \nBut going UP puts me closer to enemy territory with my tail far away \u2014 riskier.  \n\n**DOWN (1,4):**  \nNext moves from (1,4): UP back to (1,5) (body), DOWN to (1,3) (empty), LEFT to (0,4) (empty), RIGHT to (2,4) (empty).  \n3 safe moves next turn (UP is unsafe). Down from (1,4) to (1,3) keeps path to apple clear.  \n\n**LEFT (0,5):**  \nNext moves from (0,5): UP to (0,6) (empty), DOWN to (0,4) (empty), LEFT off board (dead), RIGHT to (1,5) (body).  \nOnly 2 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN). Worse.  \n\nSo **DOWN** gives 3 safe moves next turn, **LEFT** gives 2, **UP** gives 3 but riskier area.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Long-term plan note for next turns:  \nAfter moving DOWN to (1,4), head to (1,2) apple while enemy likely goes for top apples. Keep tail path open by not boxing self in. After eating (1,2), consider moving toward (5,6) or bottom-left apples if new ones spawn. Avoid top rows until enemy is gone or distracted.  \n\n---\n\n**Final move:** DOWN",

Apple proximity:\n- Apple at (1,2) is 2 steps down from (1,4).  \n- Apples at (1,8), (1,9), (0,7) are far up, enemy near them.  \n- Apple at (5,6) is 4 steps right, 2 up.  \n\nClosest safe apple is (1,2).  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Future move safety after each option:  \n\n**DOWN (1,3):**  \nFrom (1,3): UP back to (1,4) \u2013 safe (body will move forward), DOWN to (1,2) \u2013 apple, LEFT to (0,3) \u2013 empty, RIGHT to (2,3) \u2013 empty.  \nAll 4 moves safe next turn except maybe UP into new body position? Wait: after moving DOWN, my body will shift: head to (1,3), old tail (6,5) moves forward? Actually, no growth unless eat apple. If I don\u2019t eat apple now, my tail stays at (6,5), so body occupies (1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(4,5),(5,5),(6,5). Then UP from (1,3) to (1,4) is empty. Yes safe. So DOWN gives good flexibility and heads toward apple.\n\n**LEFT (0,4):**  \nFrom (0,4): UP to (0,5) \u2013 empty, DOWN to (0,3) \u2013 empty, LEFT off board \u2013 dead, RIGHT to (1,4) \u2013 body? After moving left, body shifts: head at (0,4), body at (1,4),(1,5),(2,5),... so (1,4) is my new neck, so moving RIGHT back to (1,4) would be into own body (death). So only UP and DOWN safe next turn \u2014 risky.\n\n**RIGHT (2,4):**  \nFrom (2,4): UP to (2,5) \u2013 my body currently at (2,5)? After move, body shifts: (1,4) becomes neck, (1,5) becomes next, (2,5) still body. So UP into (2,5) is death. DOWN to (2,3) \u2013 empty, LEFT to (1,4) \u2013 my neck (death), RIGHT to (3,4) \u2013 empty. So only DOWN and RIGHT safe next turn \u2014 slightly better than LEFT but worse than DOWN.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Long-term plan note:\nGo for apple at (1,2) safely, then consider (5,6) or bottom apples. Avoid top rows while enemy is there. Keep space open.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",

No possible head-on collision this turn (Manhattan distance > 2).  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Apple proximity:\nApple at (2, 1) is 1 step RIGHT, 1 step DOWN \u2192 diagonal, not reachable in one move.  \nApple at (5, 6) is 4 steps RIGHT, 4 UP.  \nApple at (0, 7) and (1, 8), (1, 9) are far up near enemy.  \n\nClosest apple is (2, 1) if I move RIGHT then DOWN next turn, or DOWN then RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n### 4.

Comparison:\n- DOWN and RIGHT both give 3 safe moves next turn, LEFT gives only 2 safe moves \u2192 eliminate LEFT.\n- RIGHT sets me up to go DOWN to (2, 1) for apple next turn.\n- DOWN sets me up to go RIGHT to (2, 1) for apple next turn \u2014 same outcome in two moves.  \n\nBut DOWN to (1, 1) puts me closer to bottom edge, which might limit options later unless I plan to go left along bottom. RIGHT to (2, 2) keeps me more central.  \n\nGiven enemy is far top-right, staying central is better for future flexibility. Also, moving RIGHT now avoids trapping myself in left column next turn (since from (1, 1), going LEFT next turn would be to (0, 1), which is fine, but from (0, 2) I had fewer options).  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nMove RIGHT now to (2, 2), then next turn go DOWN to (2, 1) to eat apple. After that, consider moving toward (5, 6) or circling back to center. Avoid top rows while enemy is there. Keep distance from enemy head.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Tail at (4, 5).  \nApples: (0, 7), (1, 8), (5, 6), (2, 1), (0, 5)  \nEnemy head: (1, 9), body: [(2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (4, 8), (4, 9), (5, 9)] length 7.\n\n---\n\n**1. Immediate safe moves from (2, 2):**  \n- UP \u2192 (2, 3): empty \u2705  \n- DOWN \u2192 (2, 1): apple \u2705  \n- LEFT \u2192 (1, 2): my body (segment right behind head) \u2192 death \u274c  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 2): empty \u2705  \n\nLEFT is eliminated.\n\n---\n\n**2. Enemy threat check:**  \nEnemy head at (1, 9) possible moves:  \nUP \u2192 (1, 10) off board \u2192 death \u274c  \nDOWN \u2192 (1, 8) apple \u2705  \nLEFT \u2192 (0, 9) empty \u2705  \nRIGHT \u2192 (2, 9) its body \u274c  \n\nSo enemy safe moves: DOWN to (1, 8) apple, LEFT to (0, 9).  \nDistance to me: Manhattan (1,9) to (2,2) = |1-2| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8 \u2192 no possible head-on collision this turn.\n\n---\n\n**3. Apple proximity:**  \nApple at (2, 1) is directly DOWN \u2192 eat now if I choose DOWN.  \nApple at (0, 5) is 2 left, 3 up.  \nApple at (5, 6) is 3 right, 4 up.  \nApples (0,7), (1,8) are far top-left near enemy.\n\nEating apple now grows me to length 9 (tail stays), but may reduce future space slightly \u2014 but still safe.\n\n---\n\n**4. Future safety after each safe move:**\n\n**DOWN to (2, 1) \u2013 eat apple:**  \nAfter move: head (2, 1), body: [(2, 1), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5)], tail at (4, 5) stays (no tail move because growth).  \nNext turn from (2, 1): UP to (2, 2) \u2013 my body \u274c, DOWN to (2, 0) \u2013 empty \u2705, LEFT to (1, 1) \u2013 empty \u2705, RIGHT to (3, 1) \u2013 empty \u2705. So 3 safe moves next turn (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n\n**UP to (2, 3) \u2013 no apple:**  \nAfter move: head (2, 3), body: [(2, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5)], tail at (4, 5) gone.  \nNext turn from (2, 3): UP to (2, 4) \u2013 empty \u2705, DOWN to (2, 2) \u2013 my body \u274c, LEFT to (1, 3) \u2013 my body \u274c, RIGHT to (3, 3) \u2013 empty \u2705. So 2 safe moves (UP, RIGHT). Riskier.\n\n**RIGHT to (3, 2) \u2013 no apple:**  \nAfter move: head (3, 2), body: [(3, 2), (2, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5)], tail gone.  \nNext turn from (3, 2): UP to (3, 3) \u2013 empty \u2705, DOWN to (3, 1) \u2013 empty \u2705, LEFT to (2, 2) \u2013 my body \u274c, RIGHT to (4, 2) \u2013 empty \u2705. So 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).\n\n---\n\n**5. Comparison:**  \nUP gives only 2 safe moves next turn \u2192 more risky.  \nDOWN and RIGHT give 3 safe moves next turn.  \nDOWN eats apple now, grows, but puts head at (2,1) with 3 safe moves next turn.  \nRIGHT avoids apple, keeps length same, head at (3,2) also 3 safe moves next turn.\n\nEating apple now gives a point, extends lead over enemy (7 vs 6 \u2192 8 vs 6), but growth reduces space slightly. However, apple at (2,1) is easy to take now and not risky \u2014 no enemy nearby.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note:**  \nTake apple DOWN now to extend lead. Next turn from (2,1) avoid going UP into body; choose DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT depending on board then. After eating, consider moving toward (5,6) or staying central. Keep enemy head far away \u2014 currently enemy at (1,9) moving likely toward apples top-left, so I can maneuver in bottom half.\n\n---\n\nDOWN",

Possible moves from (3,1):  \n- **UP** \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 Occupied? My body at (2,2) is adjacent but not the same cell. Wait \u2014 check carefully: (3,2) is not in my body list. My body: (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5). So (3,2) is empty. Enemy body at (3,9), (3,8), etc. far away. Safe from my body. Enemy head is far. Seems safe.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (3,0) \u2192 Not in my body. Not enemy body. On board. Safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (2,1) \u2192 That\u2019s my own body segment (second segment in my list). This would kill me. Not safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (4,1) \u2192 Not in my body. Not enemy body. On board. Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Immediate apple opportunities:  \n- UP to (3,2): no apple.  \n- DOWN to (3,0): no apple.  \n- RIGHT to (4,1): no apple.  \n\nNo immediate apple from these moves.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Next-turn safety (lookahead):  \n\n**If UP to (3,2):**  \nFrom (3,2), possible moves:  \n- UP to (3,3): free.  \n- DOWN to (3,1): free currently (but my body will have moved from (2,1) to \u2026 wait, careful: after I move to (3,2), my body shifts: head now at (3,2), old head (3,1) becomes new second segment, old second segment (2,1) becomes third, etc., tail (3,5) might move forward if no apple eaten. Actually, since no apple eaten, tail (3,5) disappears, body becomes: [(3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)]? Wait, length is 9 now, so after moving without apple, tail segment disappears, so body segments = 8 total including head. Let\u2019s trace: Head moves to (3,2), previous head (3,1) becomes segment 2, previous segment 2 (2,1) becomes segment 3, previous segment 3 (2,2) becomes segment 4, \u2026 previous segment 8 (3,5) becomes segment 9? That\u2019s length 9 still? No \u2014 I must be wrong: starting length 9 (head + 8 body). Move without apple \u2192 new head at (3,2), old head (3,1) becomes new segment 2, old segment 2 (2,1) becomes new segment 3, \u2026, old segment 8 (3,5) becomes new segment 9, but then we have 9 segments total still, meaning tail didn\u2019t move? That\u2019s wrong \u2014 in Snake without eating apple, tail moves off the last cell. Actually: Head moves forward, each body segment shifts into the position of the one before it, last segment (tail) vacates its old position. So new body length = same as before (9 total). But list shifts: new body = [(3,2), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)] \u2014 yes, that\u2019s 9 cells. So tail is at (2,5) now, old tail (3,5) empty.  \n\nSo from (3,2), cells occupied: (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5).  \nCheck moves from (3,2):  \nUP to (3,3): free.  \nDOWN to (3,1): occupied (my new body segment 2). So not safe.  \nLEFT to (2,2): occupied (my new body segment 4). Not safe.  \nRIGHT to (4,2): free.  \n\nSo from (3,2), safe moves: UP, RIGHT only. That\u2019s only 2 safe moves next turn \u2014 somewhat restrictive.  \n\n---\n\n**If DOWN to (3,0):**  \nFrom (3,0), body shifts similarly: new body = [(3,0), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)].  \nCheck moves from (3,0):  \nUP to (3,1): occupied (my new segment 2). Not safe.  \nDOWN: off board (y=-1). Not safe.  \nLEFT to (2,0): apple there, but also free (not occupied by my body). Actually apple at (2,0), but my body after move: (3,0), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5). So (2,0) is free. That\u2019s safe and eats apple next turn if I go LEFT.  \nRIGHT to (4,0): free.  \n\nSo safe moves from (3,0) next turn: LEFT (to apple), RIGHT. Only 2 safe moves again.  \n\n---\n\n**If RIGHT to (4,1):**  \nNew body = [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,5)].  \nFrom (4,1):  \nUP to (4,2): free.  \nDOWN to (4,0): free.  \nLEFT to (3,1): occupied (my new segment 2). Not safe.  \nRIGHT to (5,1): free.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 safe moves). More flexibility.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Strategic considerations:  \n- I have 8 apples, enemy has 7. I\u2019m ahead by 1.  \n- Apples at (5,6) and (5,8) are on the right side, so moving RIGHT now positions me better to go up toward them.  \n- Enemy at (1,7) might go for (0,7) apple or (0,5) apple.  \n- My current body blocks leftward movement, so going RIGHT opens space.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (4,1), I can go UP toward (5,6) area while keeping options open. Avoid getting trapped along edges. Monitor enemy movement toward top-left apples \u2014 they might come down toward (0,5).  \n\nGiven all:  \n- UP (3,2) \u2192 only 2 safe moves next turn, less flexible.  \n- DOWN (3,0) \u2192 only 2 safe moves next turn, though leads to apple next turn if LEFT, but traps me on bottom row.  \n- RIGHT (4,1) \u2192 3 safe moves next turn, more flexible, moves toward right-side apples.  \n\nBest choice: **RIGHT** for flexibility and positioning.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Snake #0 could go UP to (5,2), DOWN to (5,0), LEFT to (4,1), RIGHT to (6,1).\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (1,6), I could then try to go up to (1,7) next turn.\n\nLet's evaluate going DOWN to (0,5). This eats the apple on (0,5), but then I will have to avoid my own body parts.\nMy body goes from (0,7) to (4,8).\n\nI will go DOWN to eat the apple first, since there are no apparent immediate dangers with either LEFT or RIGHT. It might shorten my length compared to the other snake and give me an advantage if there are any head-on collisions in future.\nI plan to go after apple (5,6) after this move.\n\nDOWN",

Own body coords: [(4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)] \u2014 (5,2) not in that list. Safe.  \n   - Into enemy body? Enemy #1 body: [(0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9), (3,8), (4,8)] \u2014 not there.  \n   - Enemy head at (0,6), moving simultaneously. Could enemy move into (5,2)? No, too far.\n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (5,0)  \n   - In bounds? Yes.  \n   - Own body? No.  \n   - Enemy body? No.  \n   - Safe.\n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (4,1)  \n   - Own body? Yes, (4,1) is second segment of our snake \u2192 instant death. Eliminate.\n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,1)  \n   - In bounds? Yes.  \n   - Own body? No.  \n   - Enemy body? No.  \n   - Safe.\n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n**Apple positions:** (5,6), (0,5), (5,8), (2,0), (7,1)  \n\n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (6,1) \u2192 closer to apple at (7,1) (Manhattan distance 1 now, was 2 from (5,1)).  \n- **UP** \u2192 (5,2) \u2192 moves toward (5,6) (distance 4 now, was 5 from (5,1)).  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (5,0) \u2192 moves toward (2,0) maybe, but also away from most apples except (2,0).\n\n---\n\n**Safety of next moves after each choice:**\n\nFrom (6,1):  \nPossible next moves: UP (6,2), DOWN (6,0), RIGHT (7,1), LEFT (5,1).  \n- UP (6,2): safe unless enemy moves there (unlikely).  \n- DOWN (6,0): safe.  \n- RIGHT (7,1): apple there, but need to check if enemy could also go there. Enemy at (0,6) can\u2019t reach (7,1) in 1 move. Could enemy move into (7,1) next turn? No, too far. But after eating apple, we grow, so need to check if that creates dead ends later.  \n- LEFT (5,1): was head last turn, but now it\u2019s empty (our tail moved from (1,5)? Wait, check: our body: head (5,1), then (4,1),(3,1),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5). Tail is (1,5). If we move RIGHT to (6,1), then next turn head at (6,1), body grows only if we eat apple at (7,1) next move. So LEFT back to (5,1) would be into empty space next turn. So from (6,1), all 4 moves likely safe next turn except if enemy occupies.\n\nFrom (5,2):  \nPossible next: UP (5,3), DOWN (5,1), LEFT (4,2), RIGHT (6,2).  \n- DOWN (5,1): empty now (tail moved from (1,5) eventually? Let\u2019s trace: if we move UP now to (5,2), tail stays at (1,5) unless we eat apple. So (5,1) is empty next turn? Actually, body: new head (5,2), old head (5,1) becomes segment 2, then (4,1),(3,1),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5). So (5,1) occupied next turn. So DOWN from (5,2) would be suicide next turn. That\u2019s bad \u2014 reduces options.  \nSo from (5,2), DOWN is not safe next turn. That means from (5,2) only 3 safe next moves, but one is into own body? Wait, check: (5,1) will be our own body next turn if we move UP now. Yes. So DOWN from (5,2) is into own body. So from (5,2), safe next moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 3 options.\n\nFrom (5,0):  \nPossible next: UP (5,1), DOWN (5,-1) invalid, LEFT (4,0), RIGHT (6,0).  \nSo only 3 possible moves, one invalid off-board? Wait y=0, DOWN invalid. So only UP, LEFT, RIGHT next turn \u2014 3 options.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy snake #1 at (0,6):**  \nPossible moves for enemy: UP (0,7) \u2014 into its own body segment 2? Enemy body: [(0,7),(1,7),...] so (0,7) is its own body \u2192 suicide. So enemy won\u2019t choose UP.  \nDOWN (0,5) \u2014 apple there, safe? Check: (0,5) not in enemy body, not our head (we\u2019re far), so safe for them.  \nLEFT invalid. RIGHT (1,6) \u2014 empty? Yes, safe.  \nSo enemy likely DOWN to (0,5) for apple or RIGHT to (1,6).\n\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (1,6), it\u2019s moving toward center. If DOWN to (0,5), eats apple, grows.\n\n---\n\n**Collision risk:**  \nWe are at (5,1), enemy at (0,6). No overlap possible this turn.\n\nBut if we go RIGHT to (6,1), enemy can\u2019t reach us. If we go UP to (5,2), still safe. DOWN to (5,0), safe.\n\n---\n\n**Which move is best?**\n\nRIGHT (6,1):  \n- Puts us 1 step from apple (7,1).  \n- Next turn we could eat it, grow.  \n- But eating apple means our tail won\u2019t move that turn, so more body on board. Could reduce space later but okay.  \n- From (6,1), all 4 directions next turn seem safe (DOWN to (6,0) safe, LEFT to (5,1) safe? Wait, (5,1) will be our body segment 2 next turn if we move RIGHT now. Yes, so LEFT would be suicide next turn. So from (6,1), safe next moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT \u2014 3 options.\n\nUP (5,2):  \n- Closer to apples (5,6),(5,8).  \n- Next turn safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 3 options. DOWN not safe.  \n- But moves toward center, more future flexibility maybe.\n\nDOWN (5,0):  \n- Only apple nearby is (2,0), 3 steps away.  \n- Next turn safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT \u2014 3 options.  \n- Puts us near bottom edge, could limit options later.\n\n---\n\nI think **RIGHT** is slightly better because:  \n- Gets us closest to an apple (7,1) next turn.  \n- Enemy is far from (7,1), so we can likely get it uncontested.  \n- Eating apples is key to win (tied at 8 apples now).  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (6,1), if apple at (7,1) still there next turn, go RIGHT to eat it unless dangerous. Then after eating, head at (7,1), plan route toward (5,6) or (5,8) via safe path, avoiding possible enemy movement from its position. Keep space open, don\u2019t box self in.\n\nRIGHT",

If RIGHT, no apple.  \nEnemy currently has 9 apples, we have 8. If we eat apple at (7,1), we tie at 9 apples.\n\n---\n\n**Strategic considerations:**  \n- Eating apple now ties score and grows length, which reduces future mobility slightly but necessary to keep up.  \n- DOWN (6,0) reduces future options too much (only 2 safe moves next turn).  \n- UP (6,2) keeps 3 safe moves next turn and moves toward apples (5,6) and (5,8).  \n- RIGHT (7,1) gives immediate apple, ties score, keeps 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Which is best?**  \nRIGHT gets immediate apple, ties score, and from (7,1) we can go UP toward (5,6) or (5,8) next turns.  \nUP avoids growth this turn, keeps options open, but delays apple collection while enemy may collect another apple soon (they have 9 already).  \nGiven enemy\u2019s lead, catching up in apples is important.\n\nAlso, board shows apple at (7,1) right next to us \u2014 low risk, high reward.  \nEnemy is far away, no competition for this apple.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (7,1) and eating apple, head at (7,1), length 10. Next turn avoid LEFT into (6,1). Prefer UP to (7,2) to move toward (5,6) or (9,7), or RIGHT to (8,1) to explore right side apples. Keep an eye on enemy movement toward apples (5,6) or (5,8) \u2014 they might head there from (0,5) via (1,5),(2,5), etc.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

From (8,1) also possible but slightly farther.  \n\n---\n\n**Best choice:**  \nUP (7,2) \u2192 moves toward center-left apples (5,6),(5,8), keeps options open, avoids trapping ourselves.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter UP to (7,2), next turn avoid DOWN into (7,1). Consider moving LEFT toward apples while monitoring enemy movement from (1,5). If enemy moves UP toward (1,6), they may be heading for (5,6) too, so we might need to race or choose alternate apple (9,7).  \n\nUP",

So enemy will likely choose UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.  \nFrom (2, 5), enemy can\u2019t reach (7, 3), (6, 2), or (8, 2) in one move, so no immediate head-on collision possible unless we both move into the same cell indirectly? Wait, simultaneous moves mean head-on collision only if we pick same destination cell as enemy head\u2019s destination. Enemy head\u2019s possible destinations: (2, 6), (2, 4), (3, 5). None overlap with our possible destinations. So safe from head-on.  \n\n---\n\n**3.

Let\u2019s recount: given \u201cApples collected: 9\u201d, body length = apples + 1 = 10 segments. Yes: head + 9 body segments.  \nSo body: [(7,2), (7,1), (6,1), (5,1), (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (2,2), (1,2), (1,3)].  \n\nAfter moving without apple: new head at dest, rest shift, tail (1,3) removed.  \n\nFrom (7, 3) possible next moves: UP (7, 4), DOWN (7, 2), LEFT (6, 3), RIGHT (8, 3).  \nDOWN (7, 2) is old head position \u2192 now occupied by body segment (7, 2) \u2192 suicide. So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\nIf LEFT to (6, 2): body: [(6, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), \u2026, (1, 3)].  \nFrom (6, 2): UP (6, 3), DOWN (6, 1), LEFT (5, 2), RIGHT (7, 2).  \nRIGHT (7, 2) \u2192 into body segment 2 \u2192 suicide. DOWN (6, 1) \u2192 into body segment 3? Wait check: body after move: head (6,2), then (7,2), then (7,1), then (6,1), \u2026 so DOWN (6,1) \u2192 into (6,1) which is body segment 3 \u2192 suicide. So only UP and LEFT safe \u2192 2 safe moves next turn \u2192 worse.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (8, 2): body: [(8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (6, 1), \u2026].  \nFrom (8, 2): UP (8, 3), DOWN (8, 1), LEFT (7, 2), RIGHT (9, 2).  \nLEFT (7, 2) \u2192 into body segment 2 \u2192 suicide. DOWN (8, 1) safe? (8, 1) not in body. Wait body after move: head (8,2), then (7,2), then (7,1), then (6,1), \u2026 so (8,1) not in list. So safe. So safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT \u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Strategic planning:**  \nUP (7, 3) and RIGHT (8, 2) both give 3 safe moves next turn, LEFT gives only 2 \u2192 avoid LEFT.  \n\nApple at (5, 6) is reachable from both UP and RIGHT, but UP is slightly closer (Manhattan 5 vs 7). Also, UP moves toward center-top where (5, 8) also is.  \n\nEnemy at (2, 5) may move UP toward (5, 6) too, but we are farther. But we need apples to win, not just survive.  \n\nRIGHT (8, 2) moves toward (9, 7) apple eventually, but also toward right edge which could limit options later.  \n\nUP (7, 3) keeps central access.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term plan note:**  \nAfter UP to (7, 3), next turn avoid DOWN into (7, 2). Consider moving LEFT toward (5, 6) apple, but watch enemy movement from (2, 5) \u2014 they may go UP toward (2, 6) closing in on (5, 6). If they move toward it, maybe target (9, 7) instead. Keep space, avoid boxing self into left side near long body.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** UP gives best balance of safety next turn and proximity to apples.  \n\nUP",

So enemy safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nOur safe destinations: (7, 4), (6, 3), (8, 3).  \nEnemy possible destinations: (2, 7), (1, 6), (3, 6).  \nNo overlap \u2192 no possible head-on collision this turn.\n\n---\n\n**3.

Apple at (5, 6) is closer to enemy than to us: enemy distance to (5, 6) = |2-5|+|6-6|=3, our distance from (7, 3) = 4. But enemy may move toward (5, 8) or (0, 9) too.  \nIf we go LEFT to (6, 3), we move toward (5, 6) but also toward enemy's possible path.  \nIf we go UP to (7, 4), we move toward (5, 6) but also toward (5, 8) and (9, 7) later.  \nIf we go RIGHT to (8, 3), we head toward (9, 7) apple, moving away from enemy and keeping more space.\n\nGiven our long body along bottom-left, moving RIGHT opens more board space. Moving UP also good but puts us closer to top edge.  \nRight now, enemy is near (2, 6) and might go for (5, 6) apple next turn. We can instead target (9, 7) apple, which is farther from enemy.\n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nIf RIGHT now to (8, 3), next turn we can go UP toward (9, 7) or DOWN to avoid dead ends. This keeps us flexible and away from enemy congestion near left side. Also, our body blocks enemy from reaching (9, 7) quickly.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** RIGHT moves toward an apple while maintaining distance from enemy and keeping options open.\n\nRIGHT",

Next-turn mobility after each move:**  \nTail (2,2) removed unless we eat apple (we won\u2019t this turn).  \n\nIf UP to (8,4):  \nNew body: [(8,4),(8,3),(7,3),(7,2),(7,1),(6,1),(5,1),(4,1),(3,1),(2,1)]  \nFrom (8,4): UP (8,5), DOWN (8,3), LEFT (7,4), RIGHT (9,4).  \nDOWN (8,3) is body segment 2 \u2192 suicide. Safe: UP, LEFT, RIGHT \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nIf DOWN to (8,2):  \nNew body: [(8,2),(8,3),(7,3),(7,2),(7,1),(6,1),(5,1),(4,1),(3,1),(2,1)]  \nFrom (8,2): UP (8,3), DOWN (8,1), LEFT (7,2), RIGHT (9,2).  \nUP (8,3) is body segment 2 \u2192 suicide. Safe: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nIf RIGHT to (9,3):  \nNew body: [(9,3),(8,3),(7,3),(7,2),(7,1),(6,1),(5,1),(4,1),(3,1),(2,1)]  \nFrom (9,3): UP (9,4), DOWN (9,2), LEFT (8,3), RIGHT (10,3) out of bounds \u2192 suicide.  \nLEFT (8,3) is body segment 2 \u2192 suicide. Safe: UP, DOWN \u2192 only 2 safe moves.  \n\nSo UP and DOWN give 3 safe moves next turn; RIGHT gives only 2 safe moves \u2192 less flexible.  \n\n**5. Strategic considerations:**  \nApple (9,7) is closest. UP moves toward it while keeping mobility high. Enemy is far away at (2,7), moving toward apples on left side. We can safely go UP now, then next turn consider moving toward (9,7) or (5,8).  \nRIGHT would put us at (9,3) with fewer safe options next turn (only UP/DOWN), risking getting trapped near right edge.  \nDOWN moves away from apples and toward bottom edge, less optimal.  \n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter UP to (8,4), we\u2019ll be closer to (9,7). Next turn from (8,4), safe moves UP/LEFT/RIGHT. Likely choose UP to (8,5) or RIGHT to (9,4) to approach (9,7). Avoid moving into enemy\u2019s possible path; enemy is far left, so right side is safer.  \n\n**Final choice:** UP maximizes mobility and moves toward closest apple.  \n\n**END RATIONALE**  \nUP",

Strategic choice:**  \n\nApple (9,7) is two steps away via UP then RIGHT, or via RIGHT then UP (but RIGHT reduces mobility now).  \nFrom (8,6) next turn, we can go RIGHT to (9,6) then UP to (9,7) safely if path remains clear.  \nFrom (7,5) we are farther from (9,7) but closer to center apples (5,6),(5,8).  \n\nEnemy is on left side (head at (2,9)), moving toward apples (0,9) or (2,0).  \nWe can safely target top-right apple while keeping distance.  \n\nUP keeps mobility high and progresses toward (9,7) without trapping against right edge.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nAfter UP to (8,6), check if (9,7) is reachable safely. If enemy moves toward (0,9), we can continue toward (9,7) or (5,8). Avoid moving into (9,6) if it risks dead end later.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** UP maximizes mobility and approaches closest apple (9,7) while avoiding collision risk.  \n\n**END RATIONALE**  \nUP",

Which move is best strategically?**  \n\nApples: (5,6), (5,8), (2,0), (9,7), (0,9)  \n\n- RIGHT (9,7) \u2192 directly onto apple at (9,7). Eating apple grows me by 1 next turn.  \n  But going to (9,7) reduces future safe moves: from (9,7) next turn, only LEFT (8,7) is safe? Let\u2019s check: from (9,7):  \n  UP \u2192 (9,8) \u2013 empty now.  \n  DOWN \u2192 (9,6) \u2013 empty now.  \n  LEFT \u2192 (8,7) \u2013 empty now (my current head vacated).  \n  So actually 3 moves possible next turn, not so constrained.  \n\n- UP (8,8) \u2192 no apple, but closer to apple (5,8) horizontally later.  \n- LEFT (7,7) \u2192 no apple, central position.  \n\nSince eating apple gives me score lead (currently tied 9-9), RIGHT gets me to 10 apples. That could be decisive if game ends early.  \n\nBut is RIGHT safe from enemy head moving into (9,7)?  \nEnemy at (3,8) cannot reach (9,7) in one move, so no head-on collision.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Future options:**  \nFrom (9,7), I\u2019d have to be careful not to trap myself later, but next turn I\u2019d have space.  \n\n---\n\n**7. Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating apple at (9,7), my new tail end stays where it is (growth), so my body extends. I should plan to loop back toward center to avoid dead ends near right edge. Maybe next turn move LEFT back to (8,7) or UP to (9,8) depending on safety.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nRIGHT to eat apple and take score lead.  \n\nRIGHT",

At (9,9) board shows \".\" empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (9,7) \u2013 my current head position, will be empty next turn (my body moves).  \nLEFT \u2192 (8,8) \u2013 empty now.  \nRIGHT \u2192 off board (x=10) \u2013 death.  \nSo from (9,8) next turn, 3 safe moves (UP, DOWN, LEFT).\n\n**DOWN to (9,6):**  \nNext turn moves from (9,6):  \nUP \u2192 (9,7) \u2013 empty next turn.  \nDOWN \u2192 (9,5) \u2013 empty now.  \nLEFT \u2192 (8,6) \u2013 occupied by my body segment (second segment) next turn? Let\u2019s check: My body moves forward, so (8,6) will still be occupied (since my current head moves, body shifts, (8,6) becomes first body segment). So LEFT into (8,6) would be suicide next turn.  \nRIGHT \u2192 off board \u2013 death.  \nSo from (9,6) next turn, only UP and DOWN safe (2 moves).

UP puts me slightly closer to (0,9) but that\u2019s far.\n\n---\n\n**6. Enemy threat:**\n\nEnemy might move toward (5,8) apple. If I go UP to (9,8), I can move left next turn toward center/apple. If enemy goes to (5,8), we might meet later but not immediately.\n\n---\n\n**7. Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (9,8), prefer LEFT or DOWN next turn to avoid right-edge trap and move toward center/apples. Avoid staying near right edge too long. Keep an eye on enemy head movement toward apples (5,8) or (5,6).\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** UP for more future safe moves.\n\nUP",

Check for enemy body collisions:**\n\nEnemy body coordinates above \u2014 neither (9,9) nor (8,8) are in that list. Safe.\n\n---\n\n**3. Check for head-on collisions:**\n\nEnemy head at (5,8).  \nEnemy possible moves from (5,8):  \nUP \u2192 (5,9) empty.  \nDOWN \u2192 (5,7) empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (4,8) occupied by its own body (first segment) \u2014 suicide for them.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (6,8) empty.\n\nCould enemy reach (9,9) or (8,8) in one move? No, too far. So no head-on collision possible this turn.\n\n---\n\n**4. Future options after each safe move:**\n\n**UP to (9,9):**  \nNext turn moves from (9,9):  \nUP \u2192 off board (y=10) death.  \nDOWN \u2192 (9,8) \u2014 will be empty next turn (my body moves).  \nLEFT \u2192 (8,9) empty now.  \nRIGHT \u2192 off board death.  \nSo from (9,9) next turn, only DOWN and LEFT safe (2 moves).\n\n**LEFT to (8,8):**  \nNext turn moves from (8,8):  \nUP \u2192 (8,9) empty now.  \nDOWN \u2192 (8,7) \u2014 occupied by my body next turn? Let\u2019s trace: My current body shifts forward, so (9,7) becomes new second segment, (8,7) becomes third segment. So (8,7) is occupied by my body next turn \u2014 DOWN suicide.  \nLEFT \u2192 (7,8) empty now.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (9,8) empty next turn.  \nSo from (8,8) next turn, safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 moves).\n\nLEFT clearly gives more future flexibility.\n\n---\n\n**5. Apples reachable:**\n\nFrom (9,9): closest apple is (0,9) horizontally 9 left \u2014 far.  \nFrom (8,8): apples (5,6) is 3 left, 2 down; (4,1) far; (1,3) far.  \nLEFT puts me closer to center and multiple apples.\n\n---\n\n**6. Enemy threat:**\n\nEnemy at (5,8) might go for apple (5,6) by moving DOWN or RIGHT then DOWN later. If I go LEFT to (8,8), I\u2019m moving toward apples but not directly into enemy\u2019s immediate path.\n\n---\n\n**7. Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,8), next turn prefer LEFT or UP to avoid trapping myself near my own body. Keep moving toward center/apples. Watch enemy movement toward (5,6) or (4,1) apples.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** LEFT for more future safe moves and closer to apples.\n\nLEFT",

Then the apple at (4,1) is still approachable.\n\nLet's move LEFT to (4,6).\n\nLong-term plan:\n*   Continue prioritizing apples, in order of closeness.\n*   Avoid the top and left edges if possible.\n*   Monitor enemy position to avoid head-on collisions. Try to predict Snake 0's movements. Try to cut it off.\n* Prioritize survival and apple collection with awareness of positioning and opponent.\n* Go towards (4,1).\n\nLEFT",

Check head-on collisions:**\n\nEnemy head at (5, 6).  \nEnemy possible moves from (5, 6):  \nUP \u2192 (5, 7) occupied by its own body (first segment) \u2014 suicide.  \nDOWN \u2192 (5, 5) empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (4, 6) empty.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (6, 6) empty.\n\nCould enemy reach (7, 9), (7, 7), or (6, 8) in one move? No, too far. So no head-on collision possible this turn.\n\n---\n\n**4. Future options after each safe move:**\n\n**UP to (7, 9):**  \nNext turn moves from (7, 9):  \nUP \u2192 (7, 10) off board \u2192 death.  \nDOWN \u2192 (7, 8) will be empty next turn (my body shifts).  \nLEFT \u2192 (6, 9) empty now.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (8, 9) empty now.  \nSo from (7, 9) next turn, safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 moves).\n\n**DOWN to (7, 7):**  \nNext turn moves from (7, 7):  \nUP \u2192 (7, 8) empty next turn.  \nDOWN \u2192 (7, 6) empty now.  \nLEFT \u2192 (6, 7) empty now.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (8, 7) occupied by my body (third segment next turn: (9,7) becomes second, (8,7) third). That\u2019s still my body, so RIGHT is suicide.  \nSo from (7, 7) next turn, safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 moves).\n\n**LEFT to (6, 8):**  \nNext turn moves from (6, 8):  \nUP \u2192 (6, 9) empty now.  \nDOWN \u2192 (6, 7) empty now.  \nLEFT \u2192 (5, 8) occupied by enemy body (third segment: (5,8) in enemy list). Suicide.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7, 8) empty next turn.  \nSo from (6, 8) next turn, safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 moves).\n\nAll give 3 safe follow-ups, but LEFT puts me closer to enemy body next turn (risk of fewer options later).  \n\n---\n\n**5. Apples reachable:**\n\nFrom (7, 9): closest apple is (0, 9) \u2014 7 left, far.  \nFrom (7, 7): closest apple is (3, 5) \u2014 4 left, 2 down.  \nFrom (6, 8): closest apple is (3, 5) \u2014 3 left, 3 down, or (4, 1) \u2014 2 left, 7 down.  \n\nDOWN to (7, 7) seems best for moving toward apple (3, 5) and staying central.\n\n---\n\n**6. Enemy threat:**\n\nEnemy at (5, 6) likely moves DOWN to (5, 5) or LEFT to (4, 6) to avoid suicide. They might aim for apple (3, 5) too. If I go DOWN now, I\u2019m closer to (3, 5) than they are if they go DOWN. If they go LEFT to (4, 6), they\u2019re still 2 steps from (3, 5) (I\u2019d be 2 steps from (3, 5) from (7, 7) next turn). So I could compete for it.\n\n---\n\n**7. Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 7), consider moving DOWN or LEFT to approach (3, 5) while keeping distance from enemy. Avoid RIGHT into own body. If enemy moves toward (3, 5), maybe go for (4, 1) instead via LEFT/DOWN later.\n\n---\n\n**Final choice:** DOWN for proximity to apple (3, 5) and safe follow-ups.\n\nDOWN",

No, too far. So no head-on collision possible this turn.\n\n---\n\n**4. Future options after each safe move:**\n\n**DOWN to (7, 6):**  \nNext turn moves from (7, 6):  \nUP \u2192 (7, 7) will be empty next turn (my body shifts).  \nDOWN \u2192 (7, 5) empty now.  \nLEFT \u2192 (6, 6) empty now.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (8, 6) occupied by my body (sixth segment next turn: (8,6) currently 6th, will shift to 5th? Let's check:  \nAfter I move DOWN, body becomes: new head (7,6), then old (7,7) becomes 2nd?

Wait, segment 2 is (7,7) next turn, so UP into (7,7) is into my own body segment 2! Yes, suicide. So UP is also suicide.  \n\nSo from (7,6) next turn, safe moves: DOWN, LEFT only (2 moves). That\u2019s risky.\n\n---\n\n**LEFT to (6, 7):**  \nNext turn moves from (6, 7):  \nUP \u2192 (6, 8) empty now.  \nDOWN \u2192 (6, 6) empty now.  \nLEFT \u2192 (5, 7) occupied by enemy body (second segment? Enemy body: (5,6), (5,7)... yes (5,7) is enemy segment 2 currently, will shift next turn but still enemy body). Suicide.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7, 7) empty next turn (my old head position).  \n\nSo from (6,7) next turn safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 moves). Better.\n\n---\n\n**5. Apples reachable:**\n\nFrom (7,6): closest apple is (3,5) \u2014 4 left, 1 down.  \nFrom (6,7): closest apple is (3,5) \u2014 3 left, 2 down, or (4,1) \u2014 2 left, 6 down.  \n\nLEFT gets me closer horizontally to (3,5) and keeps more future options.\n\n---\n\n**6. Enemy threat:**\n\nEnemy at (4,6) can move UP, DOWN, LEFT safely. If they move LEFT to (3,6), they are closer to apple (3,5). I want to get there first. From (6,7) I can go DOWN then LEFT next turn toward (3,5), possibly beating them if they don\u2019t go directly.\n\n---\n\n**7. Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (6,7), consider moving DOWN toward (3,5) next turn if enemy hasn\u2019t taken it, else maybe target (4,1) via DOWN/LEFT later.

Possible moves from (6, 7):**  \n- UP \u2192 (6, 8): board shows empty (\u201c.\u201d).  \n- DOWN \u2192 (6, 6): board shows empty (\u201c.\u201d).  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5, 7): board shows \u201cT\u201d (enemy body). Enemy body list contains (5, 7) \u2192 yes, that\u2019s segment 3 currently. So LEFT is into enemy body \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7, 7): board shows \u201c0\u201d (my own head? Wait, that\u2019s my head at (6,7), so (7,7) is my second segment currently). Yes, my body list: second segment is (7, 7). So RIGHT is suicide.  \n\nSo safe moves: UP, DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**2. Check enemy head-on collision risk:**  \nEnemy head at (4, 5).  \nEnemy possible moves:  \nUP \u2192 (4, 6) own body \u2192 suicide.  \nDOWN \u2192 (4, 4) empty.  \nLEFT \u2192 (3, 5) apple at (3, 5) possible move.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (5, 5) empty.  \n\nCould enemy move into (6, 8) or (6, 6) this turn? No, too far (needs 2 moves). So no immediate head-on collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n**3. Future options after each safe move:**  \n\n**UP to (6, 8):**  \nNext turn possible moves from (6, 8):  \nUP \u2192 (6, 9): empty now.  \nDOWN \u2192 (6, 7): empty next turn? After moving UP, my old head (6,7) becomes segment 2, so DOWN from (6,8) goes to (6,7) which will be my own body \u2192 suicide.  \nLEFT \u2192 (5, 8): enemy body currently at (5,8) (enemy segment 4). After enemy moves, could be gone if enemy moves tail away? But currently occupied \u2192 dangerous.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7, 8): my body currently segment 3 \u2192 will be segment 4 next turn \u2192 suicide.  \n\nSo from (6,8) next turn safe moves: only UP maybe. LEFT risky if enemy stays there. This is very limiting.  \n\n---\n\n**DOWN to (6, 6):**  \nNext turn moves from (6, 6):  \nUP \u2192 (6, 7): will be my segment 2 \u2192 suicide.  \nDOWN \u2192 (6, 5): empty now.  \nLEFT \u2192 (5, 6): enemy body currently segment 2 \u2192 will shift but could still be enemy body \u2192 dangerous.  \nRIGHT \u2192 (7, 6): empty now.  \n\nSo DOWN now gives next turn safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT. Better than UP.  \n\n---\n\n**4. Apples reachable:**  \nFrom (6, 6): apple at (3, 5) is 3 left, 1 down.  \nFrom (6, 8): apple at (3, 5) is 3 left, 3 up \u2192 farther.  \nApple at (4, 1) is closer from (6,6) via DOWN/LEFT moves.  \n\n---\n\n**5. Enemy threat to apple (3, 5):**  \nEnemy at (4, 5) can move LEFT to (3, 5) and eat it this turn. If I move DOWN to (6, 6), I\u2019m still 3 away next turn, so enemy likely gets it first. Might need to target (4, 1) or (1, 3) instead.  \n\n---\n\n**6. Long-term plan:**  \nFrom (6, 6), I can go DOWN to (6, 5) next turn, then LEFT toward (4, 1) or (1, 3), avoiding enemy path. Enemy is near (3, 5) apple, probably going for it. Better to avoid fighting there, head for (4, 1) via (6,5) \u2192 (5,5) \u2192 (4,5)? Wait (4,5) enemy head now, but will move.  \n\nActually, enemy may move LEFT to (3,5) apple, leaving (4,5) empty next turn. Then I could go (6,6) \u2192 (6,5) \u2192 (5,5) \u2192 (4,5) \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 (4,3) \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 (4,1) apple. That\u2019s a path.  \n\n---\n\n**7. Decision:**  \nUP leads to fewer safe moves next turn (maybe only 1). DOWN leads to 2 safe moves and a path toward apples.  \n\nDOWN is safer for survival and keeps options open.  \n\nDOWN",

Try to predict Snake 0's movements. Try to cut it off.\n* Prioritize survival and apple collection with awareness of positioning and opponent.\n* Go for (9,4) to block the enemy and gain points.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy threat check:**  \nEnemy head at (3, 4) can move: UP to (3, 5) (its own body, suicidal), DOWN to (3, 3), LEFT to (2, 4), RIGHT to (4, 4). None of these coincide with our candidate moves (6, 4), (5, 5), (7, 5), so no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n**3. Future move analysis:**  \n- **DOWN to (6, 4):** Next turn from (6, 4), safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT (3 options). Good flexibility.  \n- **LEFT to (5, 5):** Next turn from (5, 5), only DOWN is safe (enemy body occupies (4, 5) and (5, 6), own body at (6, 5)). Very limiting.  \n- **RIGHT to (7, 5):** Next turn from (7, 5), safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options). Also flexible.\n\nLEFT is eliminated due to poor future options.\n\n---\n\n**4. Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apples: (9, 4) (distance 4) and (4, 1) (distance 6).  \n- From (6, 4): (9, 4) is 3 right, 0 down (distance 3); (4, 1) is 2 left, 3 down (distance 5).  \n- From (7, 5): (9, 4) is 2 right, 1 down (distance 3); (4, 1) is 3 left, 4 down (distance 7).  \nDOWN moves us closer to both apples; RIGHT moves us closer to (9, 4) but farther from (4, 1).\n\n---\n\n**5. Strategic considerations:**  \nEnemy is on the left side with 12 apples, likely targeting (4, 1) or (1, 3). We should focus on the right-side apple (9, 4) to avoid confrontation and catch up in score. Both DOWN and RIGHT lead toward (9, 4) in 3 moves. DOWN provides more balanced options, keeping (4, 1) as a backup. The board is crowded; DOWN moves into more open space (row 4) and away from our body above.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (6, 4), move RIGHT to (7, 4) to continue toward (9, 4). Monitor enemy movement; if enemy approaches, consider evading downward or leftward. Avoid getting trapped by long bodies.\n\nDOWN",

Good flexibility.  \n- **LEFT to (5, 4):** If enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 4), collision \u2192 death. Also, from (5, 4) next turn, safe moves: only UP and DOWN (LEFT into enemy body at (4, 4)? Actually enemy will have moved, so maybe safe, but still risky).  \n- **RIGHT to (7, 4):** Next turn from (7, 4): UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 options). Flexible.\n\nLEFT is eliminated due to head-on collision risk and limited future options.\n\n---\n\n**4. Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple is (9, 4) at distance 3 from (6, 4).  \n- DOWN to (6, 3): moves away from (9, 4).  \n- RIGHT to (7, 4): moves closer to (9, 4) (distance 2).  \nApple (4, 1) is far, not urgent.\n\n---\n\n**5. Strategic considerations:**  \nEnemy is close at (4, 4) and may move toward (4, 1) or (1, 3). I should secure (9, 4) quickly before enemy loops around. RIGHT gets me closer and into safer right side away from enemy body.  \nRIGHT also avoids potential enemy RIGHT move into (5, 4).\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 4), move RIGHT again to (8, 4) to continue toward (9, 4). Be aware enemy may move toward (4, 1) and not threaten immediately. Keep escape routes open downward if needed.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy threat and head-on collision check:**  \nEnemy head at (4, 3) can move: UP to (4, 4) (its body, unsafe), DOWN to (4, 2), LEFT to (3, 3), RIGHT to (5, 3). All safe enemy moves are at least 3 cells away from my target cells (7,5), (7,3), (8,4). No head-on collision possible this turn.\n\n---\n\n**3. Apple targeting and future flexibility:**  \nClosest apple is (9, 4) at distance 2.  \n- UP to (7, 5): distance to (9,4) increases to 3, and from (7,5) only UP and RIGHT are safe next turn (2 options).  \n- DOWN to (7, 3): distance to (9,4) increases to 3, but gets closer to (4,1). From (7,3), DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe next turn (3 options).  \n- RIGHT to (8, 4): distance to (9,4) decreases to 1. From (8,4), UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe next turn (3 options).  \nRIGHT maximizes progress toward the nearest apple while maintaining good future mobility.\n\n---\n\n**4. Strategic considerations:**  \nWe are behind (10 vs 12 apples). Securing (9,4) quickly is efficient. Enemy is far from (9,4) and likely to target (4,1) or (1,3). Moving RIGHT avoids enemy interaction and positions us to eat the apple next turn. After eating, we can move UP or DOWN from (9,4) to regain space.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8, 4), move RIGHT to (9, 4) to eat the apple unless blocked. Then assess UP/DOWN for exit. Monitor enemy movement toward other apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Board shows col 3 row 2 is '.' (empty). Not enemy body. Safe for them.  \n- Down \u2192 (3, 0) \u2192 empty.  \n- Left \u2192 (2, 1) \u2192 empty.  \n- Right \u2192 (4, 1) \u2192 occupied by enemy\u2019s own body segment 2 \u2192 invalid for them.  \n\nSo enemy can go U, D, L this turn.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Avoid head-on collisions\nMy possible safe moves: **DOWN** to (9, 2), **LEFT** to (8, 3).  \n\nWhere can enemy head end up?  \nIf enemy moves:  \n- Up \u2192 (3, 2)  \n- Down \u2192 (3, 0)  \n- Left \u2192 (2, 1)  \n\nNone of these conflict with my possible (9, 2) or (8, 3). So no head-on risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Which move is better for apples / future mobility?  \n\nApples:  \n- (7, 2) \u2013 from (9, 3):  \n  - If I go DOWN to (9, 2), next move I can go LEFT twice toward (7, 2), but need to check path: (9, 2) \u2192 (8, 2) \u2192 (7, 2). That\u2019s 2 moves away.  \n  - If I go LEFT to (8, 3), then DOWN to (8, 2), then LEFT to (7, 2) also 2 moves away.  \n\n- (7, 6) \u2013 far from me now.  \n- (2, 0), (0, 9), (1, 3) \u2013 far, enemy closer to some.  \n\nBut also check board:  \nFrom (9, 2): possible next moves: UP (back to (9, 3)), LEFT (8, 2), DOWN (9, 1). That\u2019s 3 options, but UP is occupied by my body next turn? Wait, if I move DOWN now, my body shifts: head to (9, 2), tail (9, 8) disappears if no apple eaten. So (9, 3) becomes free next turn? Let\u2019s check: body length 12 (11 segments + head? Actually apples 11 means length 12? Count: head + 11 body segments = 12 total). Eating apple makes length increase by 1 next turn. Currently length = 12 (since apples collected = 11 \u2192 length = 12). After move without apple, length stays 12, so tail end moves forward: tail was (9, 8) becomes new tail at (8, 8)? Wait, body list: head (9, 3) moving to (9, 2), then body shifts: (9, 4) becomes new neck at (9, 3), (8, 4) \u2192 (9, 4), etc. Actually let\u2019s shift:  \nOld body: (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), (8, 8), (9, 8).  \nAfter moving head to (9, 2):  \nNew body: (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8), (8, 8). Tail (9, 8) gone.  \n\nSo next turn from (9, 2), UP to (9, 3) is occupied by my own body segment 2 (the old head position). So UP not safe next turn. So from (9, 2) next turn safe moves: LEFT (8, 2), DOWN (9, 1). That\u2019s only 2 safe moves.  \n\nFrom (8, 3): if I go LEFT now, next turn body: head (8, 3), body: (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8). Tail (8, 8) gone.  \n\nFrom (8, 3) next turn possible moves:  \n- UP (8, 4) \u2192 occupied by my body (segment 3 old (8, 4) shifted to (8, 4)? Wait check: after move LEFT, body shifts: old (9, 4) \u2192 (9, 3), old (8, 4) \u2192 (9, 4), old (7, 4) \u2192 (8, 4), so (8, 4) is occupied. So UP unsafe.  \n- DOWN (8, 2) \u2192 free  \n- LEFT (7, 3) \u2192 free  \n- RIGHT (9, 3) \u2192 occupied by my body (old head position).  \n\nSo from (8, 3) next turn also 2 safe moves (DOWN, LEFT).  \n\nSo mobility same.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 5 \u2013 Path to nearest apple  \n(7, 2) is closest. From (9, 2) path: (9, 2) \u2192 (8, 2) \u2192 (7, 2). Need to check if (8, 2) free next turn? Currently empty. Enemy won\u2019t be there likely.  \n\nFrom (8, 3) path: (8, 3) \u2192 (8, 2) \u2192 (7, 2) same steps but first move DOWN then LEFT.  \n\nActually both require (8, 2) as intermediate.  \n\nBut going DOWN now puts me at (9, 2), then next turn LEFT to (8, 2) gets me closer.  \n\nGoing LEFT now to (8, 3), then DOWN to (8, 2) also same.  \n\nBut if I go LEFT now, I\u2019m closer to center, maybe more options later.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 6 \u2013 Avoid future dead ends  \nBoard right edge (x=9) is risky because only LEFT is ever available from there (unless at top/bottom). I\u2019m currently at x=9. Better to move away from edge to have 3 potential directions next turn instead of 2.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (8, 3), I\u2019m off the right edge, which is good for future mobility.  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (9, 2), I\u2019m still on right edge.  \n\nSo LEFT seems better for future options.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 7 \u2013 Long-term plan note  \nLEFT now to (8, 3), then aim for (7, 2) apple via (8, 2). Keep an eye on enemy heading toward (2, 0) or (1, 3). After eating (7, 2), consider going toward (7, 6) or center to avoid being trapped on edges.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT",

Wait, rule: \u201cIf you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment\u201d \u2192 length increases by 1, so tail does not move. So body list: head (7, 2), then (8, 2), (8, 3), \u2026, (7, 8), and tail (7, 8) stays (duplicate) \u2192 actually means body length increases, so next turn\u2019s body: head (7, 2), then (8, 2), (8, 3), \u2026, (7, 7), (7, 8) (same as before plus one extra copy of tail at end). But the duplicate (7, 8) stays at end, so no cell freed.  \n\nFrom (7, 2) next turn:  \n- UP (7, 3) \u2192 free  \n- DOWN (7, 1) \u2192 free  \n- LEFT (6, 2) \u2192 free  \n- RIGHT (8, 2) \u2192 occupied by my body  \n\u2192 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n**If RIGHT to (9, 2):**  \nBody next turn: head (9, 2), body: (8, 2), (8, 3), (9, 3), (9, 4), (8, 4), (7, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), (7, 8) \u2014 tail (7, 8) gone.  \nFrom (9, 2) next turn:  \n- UP (9, 3) \u2192 occupied by my body  \n- DOWN (9, 1) \u2192 free  \n- LEFT (8, 2) \u2192 occupied by my body  \n- RIGHT off board \u2192 invalid  \n\u2192 only 1 safe move (DOWN). Dangerous.  \n\nSo RIGHT is risky for future mobility.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple strategy**  \nApple at (7, 2) is 1 move away via LEFT now. Eating it now gives me length 13 (12 \u2192 13), enemy length 14. Still behind by 1 apple.  \nApple at (7, 6) is reachable after (7, 2) via (7, 3) etc.  \nApple at (0, 4) and (0, 9) far. Apple at (1, 3) closer to enemy maybe.  \n\nEating (7, 2) now also puts me near (7, 6) path.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid dead ends**  \nRIGHT leads to corner with only 1 exit next turn \u2192 avoid.  \nDOWN and LEFT both give 3 safe moves next turn, but LEFT gets apple now.  \n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Enemy threat**  \nEnemy at (2, 0) moving LEFT to (1, 0) or RIGHT to (3, 0) \u2014 both far from me. No immediate danger.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next few turns:**  \nEat (7, 2) now, then move toward (7, 6) via (7, 3) or (6, 2) depending on safety. Keep distance from enemy who may go for (1, 3) apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Final choice:**  \nLEFT",

Body: [(6,2), (7,2), (8,2), (8,3), (9,3), (9,4), (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7)].  \n\n**Enemy snake #1:** Head at (1,2), body extends as listed.  \n\n**Apples:** (0,9), (1,3), (7,6), (0,4), (4,9).  \n\n---\n\n### 1. Check each move for immediate death  \n\nFrom (6,1):  \n\n- **UP** \u2192 (6,2) \u2192 occupied by my own body segment (first body segment after head) \u2192 deadly.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (6,0) \u2192 board is 0\u20139 in y, so valid. No snake body there currently (check board: at (6,0) is empty). Enemy body? Snake #1 body: (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), etc. Not (6,0). Safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 board valid, no my body there (my body at (6,1), (6,2), etc.), enemy body? Snake #1 body: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1)? No, (5,1) not listed. Board shows at (5,1) is empty. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (7,1) \u2192 board valid, my body? No. Enemy body? Snake #1 body: no. Safe.  \n\nSo UP is invalid (self-collision). DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are safe from immediate collision with bodies.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Consider enemy snake #1\u2019s possible moves from (1,2)  \n\nEnemy head at (1,2), body: (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6).  \n\nIts safe moves from (1,2):  \n- UP \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 apple there, but is (1,3) occupied by any body? No. But apple means it might move there.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1,1) \u2192 occupied by its own body \u2192 deadly.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0,2) \u2192 empty, safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 empty, safe.  \n\nSo enemy could go UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\nIf enemy goes UP to (1,3), that\u2019s an apple, enemy grows, and next turn its head is at (1,3) with longer body.  \n\nIf enemy goes LEFT to (0,2), that\u2019s safe but away from me.  \n\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (2,2), safe.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Check for possible head-on collisions  \n\nMy possible moves:  \n\n**DOWN** to (6,0): enemy can\u2019t reach (6,0) in one move from (1,2), so no head-on collision risk.  \n\n**LEFT** to (5,1): enemy can\u2019t reach (5,1) in one move (max move distance 1 in x or y). From (1,2) to (5,1) is dx=4, dy=-1 \u2192 impossible in one move. So no head-on risk.  \n\n**RIGHT** to (7,1): enemy from (1,2) to (7,1) is dx=6, dy=-1 \u2192 impossible in one move. So no head-on risk.  \n\nSo no immediate head-on collision danger with enemy head for any of my safe moves.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility after each move  \n\n**DOWN** to (6,0):  \nFrom (6,0), possible next moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (6,1) \u2192 currently my neck at (6,1) will be vacated when I move, but my body segment at (6,2) stays, so (6,1) will be empty next turn. So UP next turn safe.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (5,0) \u2192 empty now, safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (7,0) \u2192 empty now, safe.  \nSo 3 moves next turn. Edge at bottom means DOWN from (6,0) is off board, so not available. So 3 options.  \n\n**LEFT** to (5,1):  \nFrom (5,1), possible next moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (5,2) \u2192 board shows at (5,2): from layout, seems empty. Yes.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,0) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,1) \u2192 occupied by enemy body segment (snake #1 body at (4,1)) \u2192 deadly next turn.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,1) \u2192 empty (my old head position).  \n\nSo LEFT from (5,1) next turn is deadly, so only 3 safe moves next turn actually (UP, DOWN, RIGHT).  \n\n**RIGHT** to (7,1):  \nFrom (7,1), possible next moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (7,2) \u2192 occupied by my body segment (second segment in my body) \u2192 deadly.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (7,0) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,1) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,1) \u2192 empty.  \n\nSo only 3 safe moves next turn (UP is deadly).  \n\nSo all three safe moves give 3 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Apple proximity  \n\nApples: (0,9) far, (1,3) close to enemy head, (7,6) above right, (0,4) left side, (4,9) top right.  \n\nFrom my head (6,1):  \n- DOWN to (6,0): away from most apples.  \n- LEFT to (5,1): closer to (0,4) and (1,3) but (1,3) is risky (enemy may take it this turn).  \n- RIGHT to (7,1): closer to (7,6) via future moves.  \n\n(7,6) is at top right, my body occupies (6,7),(6,6),(6,5),(6,4) etc. blocking upward on my left column. To reach (7,6), I could go RIGHT now to (7,1), then UP over time. But my body blocks some upward paths.  \n\nFrom (6,1), going RIGHT seems to open path toward (7,6) better than LEFT toward (1,3) which is near enemy.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Avoid enemy head collision next turn  \n\nIf enemy goes UP to (1,3) (apple), then from (1,3) next turn it could move to (1,4), (0,3), (2,3). Not near me immediately.  \n\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (2,2), then next turn could move toward (3,2) etc., still not near me.  \n\nSo no immediate danger of head-on next turn regardless of my move.  \n\n---\n\n### 7. Long-term space  \n\nMy body forms a vertical block on x=6 from y=4 to y=7, and horizontal at top, creating a C-shaped barrier. Moving DOWN to (6,0) keeps me near bottom open space. Moving RIGHT to (7,1) goes into more open right side. Moving LEFT to (5,1) approaches more cluttered area with enemy body nearby at (4,1),(3,1), etc.  \n\nBetter to go RIGHT to stay flexible and approach (7,6) apple while keeping distance from enemy.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (7,1), next turn consider UP if clear, else RIGHT/DOWN to navigate toward (7,6). Avoid getting trapped by my own body. Monitor enemy movement toward (1,3) apple.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Body: [(6,1), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), (8,3), (9,3), (9,4), (8,4), (7,4), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)].\n\n**Enemy snake #1:** Head at (1,3), body: [(1,2), (1,1), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6)].\n\n**Apples:** (0,9), (7,6), (0,4), (4,9), (2,7).\n\n---\n\n### 1. Immediate safety check from (7,1):\n\n- **UP** \u2192 (7,2) \u2192 occupied by my body (third segment) \u2192 deadly.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (7,0) \u2192 empty, safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (6,1) \u2192 occupied by my body (first segment after head) \u2192 deadly.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (8,1) \u2192 empty, safe.\n\nSo only **DOWN** and **RIGHT** are safe.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy possible moves from (1,3):\n\nEnemy head at (1,3). Its body occupies (1,2), (1,1), etc.  \nPossible moves:  \n- UP \u2192 (1,4) \u2192 empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 own body \u2192 deadly.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0,3) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 empty.\n\nSo enemy could go UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Head-on collision risk this turn:\n\nMy DOWN to (7,0): enemy can't reach (7,0) in one move (dx=6, dy=-3) \u2192 impossible.  \nMy RIGHT to (8,1): enemy can't reach (8,1) in one move (dx=7, dy=-2) \u2192 impossible.\n\nNo immediate head-on risk.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Future mobility:\n\n**DOWN to (7,0):**  \nNext moves from (7,0):  \n- UP \u2192 (7,1) \u2192 empty (my old head position).  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 deadly.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (6,0) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (8,0) \u2192 empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n**RIGHT to (8,1):**  \nNext moves from (8,1):  \n- UP \u2192 (8,2) \u2192 occupied by my body (fourth segment) \u2192 deadly.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (8,0) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (7,1) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (9,1) \u2192 empty.  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn.\n\nBoth give same immediate future mobility.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Apple proximity and pathing:\n\nApples: (7,6) is the closest relevant one.  \nFrom (7,1), going RIGHT to (8,1) gets me closer to the right side, where I can later go UP toward (7,6) after maneuvering around my body.  \nFrom (7,0), I'm at the bottom edge, farther from most apples.\n\nMy body blocks a direct vertical path on x=6 and x=7 from y=2 upward. To reach (7,6), I need to go right further then up, then left.  \nGoing RIGHT now helps that plan.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Enemy threat:\n\nEnemy might take apple at (0,4) or (2,7).  \nIf enemy goes UP to (1,4), it could aim for (2,7) later.  \nMy move RIGHT keeps me away from enemy's possible path.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Long-term space:\n\nMy body forms a C-shape: vertical on x=6 from y=2 to y=6, horizontal at top.  \nRIGHT moves me into more open right side, avoiding the cluttered left where enemy body is.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter RIGHT to (8,1), next turn I can go DOWN to (8,0) or RIGHT to (9,1) to keep space, then aim to go UP on column 9 or 8 to approach (7,6), being careful not to trap myself. Monitor enemy movement toward apples.\n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Immediate safe moves from (8,0):  \n- **UP** to (8,1): That\u2019s my body\u2019s first segment \u2192 **death**.  \n- **DOWN**: (8,-1) \u2192 off board \u2192 **death**.  \n- **LEFT** to (7,0): empty in board state \u2192 safe (no body there).  \n- **RIGHT** to (9,0): empty in board state \u2192 safe.  \n\nSo only LEFT and RIGHT are possible.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Enemy snake #1 head at (0,4) \u2014 far away, no immediate collision risk.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Future mobility after each safe move:  \n\n**LEFT to (7,0):**  \nFrom (7,0), possible moves:  \n- UP to (7,1) \u2192 body segment (my own) \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT to (6,0) \u2192 empty (board shows \u201c.\u201d at (6,0)).  \n- RIGHT to (8,0) \u2192 empty now (but was head).  \n\nSo from (7,0), only LEFT is safe next turn? Wait \u2014 check carefully:  \nBoard at (6,0) is \u201c.\u201d, at (7,1) is \u201cT\u201d (my body), at (8,0) will be empty next turn since head moved. So from (7,0):  \n- UP blocked.  \n- DOWN blocked.  \n- LEFT safe.  \n- RIGHT safe (backtracking to (8,0) is okay as long as it\u2019s not into body \u2014 but (8,0) will be empty next turn).  \n\nSo actually from (7,0), LEFT and RIGHT are safe next turn. That\u2019s 2 options.  \n\n---\n\n**RIGHT to (9,0):**  \nFrom (9,0), possible moves:  \n- UP to (9,1) \u2192 empty? Board shows (9,1) is \u201c.\u201d (row y=1, x=9).  \n- DOWN \u2192 off board \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT to (8,0) \u2192 empty next turn \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 off board \u2192 death.  \n\nSo from (9,0), only UP and LEFT are safe next turn \u2192 2 options as well.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Apples reachable:  \nApples at: (0,9), (7,6), (4,9), (2,7), (7,7).  \nFrom (8,0), LEFT goes toward (7,6) general area eventually, but many body segments in the way.  \nRIGHT to (9,0) goes toward top-right area where apple (0,9) is far left, but path blocked by enemy body.  \n\nNeither move gets me immediately closer to an apple in a straight line.  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Avoid dead ends:  \nLEFT to (7,0) \u2192 then can go LEFT to (6,0), then possibly up later when body clears.  \nRIGHT to (9,0) \u2192 then UP to (9,1), then maybe (9,2) etc.  \n\nCheck board at (9,1): empty. (9,2): empty. (9,3): my body, so careful.  \n\nActually, looking at my body: (9,3) and (9,4) are my body, so going UP from (9,0) to (9,1) to (9,2) to (9,3) would hit myself at (9,3) if I go there in 3 turns. But that\u2019s manageable if I turn left before then.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Which is safer long-term?  \nLEFT to (7,0) keeps me along bottom row with enemy far away. My own body occupies (7,1),(6,1),(6,2), etc., so going to (6,0) then maybe (5,0) is possible.  \n\nRIGHT to (9,0) then UP along right wall \u2014 but (8,3),(9,3) are my body, so can\u2019t go up beyond y=2 without hitting myself unless I turn left earlier. That\u2019s more constrained.  \n\nLEFT seems slightly better because bottom row has fewer obstacles ahead.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (7,0), go LEFT to (6,0), then assess. Possibly continue left to (5,0), then up when safe to approach apples. Avoid going up into my own body at (7,1)/(6,1)/(6,2). Wait for those to clear as I move.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",

Future mobility after each safe move:\n\n**LEFT to (6,0):**  \nFrom (6,0), next turn possible moves:  \n- UP to (6,1): my body \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN: off board \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT to (5,0): empty \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT to (7,0): will be empty next turn \u2192 safe.  \nSo 2 safe options next turn from (6,0).\n\n**RIGHT to (8,0):**  \nFrom (8,0), next turn possible moves:  \n- UP to (8,1): my body \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN: off board \u2192 death.  \n- LEFT to (7,0): empty \u2192 safe.  \n- RIGHT to (9,0): empty \u2192 safe.  \nAlso 2 safe options next turn from (8,0).\n\n---\n\n### 4. Apples reachable:\nApples at: (0,9), (7,6), (4,9), (2,7), (7,7).  \n- Going LEFT to (6,0) moves me closer to the bottom-left area, but apples are mostly top/middle.  \n- Going RIGHT to (8,0) moves me toward right side, but apples are far away except (7,6) and (7,7) above.  \nNeither move gets me much closer immediately.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Long-term safety:\nMy body occupies (7,1), (6,1), (6,2), etc. If I go LEFT to (6,0), I can then go LEFT again to (5,0), staying along bottom row while my body clears upward segments over time.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (8,0), I can then go RIGHT to (9,0) or LEFT back to (7,0), but that might cycle me near my own body without gaining space.  \nLEFT seems better for opening future paths toward the left side where fewer body segments block upward moves later.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Plan for next few turns:\nFrom (6,0), go LEFT to (5,0) if safe, then possibly (4,0), then up when (6,1) etc. clear. Avoid moving up into my own body at (6,1)/(7,1)/(6,2) for now. Wait for tail to move further away (tail is at (7,4)).\n\n---\n\nLEFT",

These are far.\n- Apple at (7,6), (7,7). These are quite far and snake 0 might want these.\n\nConsider going up to (1, 6). Long term plan:\n\nMoving up, will hopefully give room to turn and go to apples at (0,9), (4,9), (2,7).\n\nSnake 0 is at (6,0). If Snake 0 moves to (7,0) then it has potential to move and block off access to (7,6) and (7,7) so I shouldn't really bother with these.\n\nLEFT to (0,5): Might get cramped with snake 0 moving around towards the right of the board.\nRIGHT to (2,5): Has a higher chance of getting cramped.\n\nLong-term plan:\n* Prioritize the reachable apples, considering the opponent's location and moves.\n* Continue to observe the movement of the opponent. Try and predict their moves so I can intercept apples they are going for.\n* I want to reach at least 20 apples before turn 100.\n* Try to approach the upper side apples (0,9), (4,9), (2,7).\n\nI'll move UP to (1,6).\n\nUP",

These are far.\n- Apple at (7,6), (7,7). These are quite far and snake 0 might want these.\n\nScenario: Snake 0 might go UP to (5,1).\nIf I go UP to (1,7), I can later go to (2,7).\nIf I go LEFT to (0,6), I can later go to (0,9).\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,6), I can later go to (2,7).\n\nI need to be careful about Snake 0. It seems to be sticking around the right side of the board. Given it's apple count, I might want to block it from going to the top side.\n\nI will move UP to (1,7).\n\nUP",

Immediate safe moves from (5,0):\n- **UP** to (5,1): Empty ('.' on board), not occupied by any body after moves, not off board \u2192 safe.\n- **DOWN** to (5,-1): Off board \u2192 death.\n- **LEFT** to (4,0): Empty ('.' on board), likely safe after moves.\n- **RIGHT** to (6,0): Currently occupied by my body (first segment). Moving RIGHT is directly backwards into the cell behind my head (since last move was LEFT), which counts as hitting myself \u2192 death.\n\nSafe moves: **UP** and **LEFT**.\n\n### 2. Enemy snake #1 head at (1,6):\nEnemy's possible moves: UP to (1,7), LEFT to (0,6), RIGHT to (2,6). DOWN to (1,5) is its own body. No risk of head-on collision at (5,1) or (4,0) this turn.\n\n### 3. Future mobility after each safe move:\n- **UP to (5,1)**: Next turn, from (5,1):\n  - UP to (5,2): likely safe (empty now, no enemy body nearby).\n  - DOWN to (5,0): unsafe (directly backwards into own body).\n  - LEFT to (4,1): likely unsafe (occupied by enemy body after enemy moves).\n  - RIGHT to (6,1): possibly safe (body segment moves out, but need to verify next turn).\n  So at least 1-2 safe options (UP and possibly RIGHT).\n\n- **LEFT to (4,0)**: Next turn, from (4,0):\n  - UP to (4,1): likely unsafe (enemy body).\n  - DOWN: off board.\n  - LEFT to (3,0): likely safe (empty, no enemy body).\n  - RIGHT to (5,0): unsafe (directly backwards into own body).\n  So only LEFT (to (3,0)) appears safe.\n\nUP offers better future mobility.\n\n### 4. Apples reachable:\nApples at (0,9), (7,6), (4,9), (2,7), (7,7). Moving UP starts moving toward the upper half, closer to apples (4,9) and (7,6)/(7,7) in the long run. Moving LEFT goes along the bottom edge away from most apples.\n\n### 5. Long-term strategy:\n- Move UP to (5,1) to gain space and options.\n- Next, consider UP to (5,2) or RIGHT to (6,1) if safe, avoiding LEFT into enemy territory.\n- Gradually work toward the right side to target apples (7,6) and (7,7), while monitoring enemy #1's longer body to avoid traps.\n- Enemy has more apples (16 vs 12) and is longer; avoid direct confrontation.\n\nUP is preferred for mobility and progress toward apples.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

No.  \n  Occupied by enemy body? Check enemy body list: (3,7),(2,7),(1,7),(1,6),(1,5),(1,4),(0,4),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(4,2),(4,3),(4,4).  \n  (5, 4) not in that list.  \n  Safe from immediate collision with enemy body.\n\n- **DOWN**: (5, 2)  \n  That\u2019s my own body segment (second in my body list). Immediate death \u2192 eliminate.\n\n- **LEFT**: (4, 3)  \n  Occupied by my body? My body: check\u2026 (5,2),(5,1),(5,0),(6,0),(7,0),(8,0),(8,1),(7,1),(6,1),(6,2),(7,2),(8,2) \u2192 no (4,3).  \n  Occupied by enemy body? Enemy body list above: (4,3) is in enemy body list \u2192 yes! (It\u2019s the 17th segment in enemy list: \u2026(4,3)).  \n  So moving LEFT hits enemy body \u2192 immediate death \u2192 eliminate.\n\n- **RIGHT**: (6, 3)  \n  Occupied by my body? No.  \n  Occupied by enemy body? Not in enemy body list.  \n  Safe from immediate body collision.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Head-on collision risk**\n\nEnemy head at (3, 7). Possible moves for enemy:\n\nFrom (3, 7):  \nUP (3,8) \u2013 empty  \nDOWN (3,6) \u2013 empty  \nLEFT (2,7) \u2013 that\u2019s enemy\u2019s own body (second segment) \u2192 not allowed  \nRIGHT (4,7) \u2013 empty  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nIf I move UP to (5, 4), enemy moving RIGHT to (4,7) or UP/DOWN won\u2019t meet me.  \nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 3), enemy moving RIGHT to (4,7) no collision.  \nNo possible enemy move reaches my target cell in one step \u2192 no head-on risk for either UP or RIGHT this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Future mobility after each safe move**\n\n**UP to (5, 4)**:  \nFrom (5,4), possible next moves:  \nUP (5,5): free  \nDOWN (5,3): currently my head\u2019s old spot, but after move, will it be occupied? My tail will move if I don\u2019t eat apple. I\u2019m not eating apple this turn (no apple at (5,4)), so my tail (8,2) will move to (7,2) next turn? Wait, my body length stays same unless I eat apple. Tail movement: last segment (8,2) disappears, new segment added at head, so (5,3) becomes free next turn. So DOWN next turn would be into (5,3) which is free.  \nLEFT (4,4): enemy body segment (4,4) \u2192 not safe next turn? Actually (4,4) is enemy body now, but enemy will move too. Could become free if enemy moves tail away? But risky.  \nRIGHT (6,4): free.\n\nSo from (5,4), next turn safe moves likely: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (3 moves). LEFT risky.\n\n**RIGHT to (6, 3)**:  \nFrom (6,3), possible next moves:  \nUP (6,4): free  \nDOWN (6,2): my body segment currently at (6,2) \u2014 will it be there next turn? My tail at (8,2) moves to (7,2), so (6,2) stays occupied (my 10th segment). So DOWN into own body \u2192 not safe next turn.  \nLEFT (5,3): free next turn (my old head spot).  \nRIGHT (7,3): free.\n\nSo from (6,3), next turn safe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT (3 moves). DOWN not safe.\n\nBoth give 3 safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Apple proximity**\n\nApples: (0,9) far, (7,6), (4,9), (7,7), (2,2).\n\nFrom (5,3):  \nUP (5,4): closer to (7,6) and (7,7) in y-direction.  \nRIGHT (6,3): closer to (7,6) and (7,7) in x-direction.  \nBoth move toward those apples.  \n\n(7,6) and (7,7) are close to each other, enemy snake is far left/top, so maybe I can get there first.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Avoid enemy territory**\n\nEnemy is long (length 18+1 head?), my length is 12+head? Wait my body list length = 12 segments + head? Actually body list given is 12 segments, head separate. So total length = 13.\n\nEnemy length: body list length = 18 segments + head = 19 total. Much longer.\n\nEnemy occupies left side heavily. Staying right is safer.  \nUP (5,4) is slightly more central, RIGHT (6,3) is more right.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7 \u2013 Decision**\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT safe this turn, similar future mobility.  \nBut last move was UP, so moving UP again might reduce flexibility? Not necessarily.  \n\nActually, from (5,4), I can go RIGHT to (6,4) next to approach apples. From (6,3), I can go UP to (6,4) same.  \n\nBut check board: apples (7,6) and (7,7) are near top right. UP increases y faster.  \n\nI\u2019ll choose UP to get closer in y to those apples.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns**:  \nFrom (5,4), aim to go RIGHT then UP toward (7,6)/(7,7). Avoid left side because enemy is there. Keep checking enemy head movement to avoid head-on collisions. Try to eat apples while staying in open area on right side.\n\n---\n\n**Final move**:  \nUP",

Be careful to avoid getting trapped by my body. Observe the enemy snake's behavior, especially its future movements that could cause possible collisions.

None of these match our target cells (5,5), (4,4), or (6,4). So no head-on collision possible.\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Future mobility and apple proximity**\n\nApples: (7,6) and (7,7) are closest and on the right side. Moving RIGHT to (6,4) reduces Manhattan distance to (7,6) from 4 to 3. From (6,4), next turn we have three guaranteed safe moves (UP to (6,5), DOWN to (6,3), RIGHT to (7,4)) since LEFT leads into our own body. Moving UP to (5,5) gives only two guaranteed safe moves (UP to (5,6), RIGHT to (6,5)) because DOWN is into our body and LEFT may be risky. Moving LEFT to (4,4) moves us into enemy territory and reduces future options.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long-term strategy**\n\nWe are behind in apples (12 vs 18). Targeting the apples at (7,6) and (7,7) is efficient and keeps us away from the enemy\u2019s dense body area on the left. Moving RIGHT maintains flexibility and opens a path to these apples: e.g., (6,4) \u2192 (6,5) \u2192 (6,6) \u2192 (7,6). Monitor enemy head movement to avoid future head-on collisions.\n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (6,4), proceed toward (7,6) and (7,7) via UP and RIGHT moves, staying in the open right side. Avoid moving left into congested areas.\n\nRIGHT",

Actually, snake growth: when eating apple, head moves to apple cell, new head segment added, tail does not move this turn. So length increases by 1, tail stays at (7,1). Next turn tail will move to (6,5)? Let's list body after UP move:  \nNew body: [(7,6), (7,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0), (8,0), (8,1), (7,1)] \u2014 length 14.  \nNext turn tail will be at (6,5)? No, shift: head moves, each segment moves into previous segment\u2019s position, tail stays if apple eaten. Actually, in Snake, when you eat an apple, you grow, so tail does not move that turn. Next turn, if you don\u2019t eat apple, tail moves. So after this turn, tail still at (7,1). Next turn if I move UP to (7,7) and eat apple again, tail still at (7,1). If I don\u2019t eat apple next turn, tail moves to (6,5). This is fine.\n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP gets apple, increases score to 13, puts me in strong position to get (7,7) next turn, and keeps many safe moves. It\u2019s safe (no collision with enemy possible this turn). Enemy is far away.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:** From (7,6), go UP to (7,7) to eat second apple if safe. Then consider moving toward (0,9) or (8,9) while avoiding enemy. Keep monitoring enemy head movement to avoid head-on collisions. If enemy approaches, use right side of board where my body provides some barrier.\n\nUP",

Its possible moves:  \n- UP to (6,10) \u2192 off board.  \n- DOWN to (6,8) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT to (5,9) \u2192 its own body (segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT to (7,9) \u2192 empty.  \nSo enemy can move to (6,8) or (7,9).  \nMy candidate cells: (7,7), (6,6), (8,6). None match enemy\u2019s possible moves \u2192 no head\u2011on collision this turn.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and future mobility**  \nApples: (0,9), (7,7), (2,2), (8,9), (8,2).  \n- UP (7,7): lands on apple \u2192 grow by 1, score to 14, tail stays at (7,1).  \n- LEFT (6,6): no apple, moves toward center.  \n- RIGHT (8,6): no apple, moves toward (8,9) or (8,2) eventually.  \n\nFrom (7,7) after eating apple:  \nNext turn UP to (7,8) empty, DOWN to (7,6) my body, LEFT to (6,7) empty, RIGHT to (8,7) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nFrom (6,6): UP to (6,7) empty, DOWN to (6,5) my body, LEFT to (5,6) empty, RIGHT to (7,6) my body \u2192 2 safe moves.  \n\nFrom (8,6): UP to (8,7) empty, DOWN to (8,5) empty, LEFT to (7,6) my body, RIGHT to (9,6) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nUP gives apple and 3 safe moves next turn. RIGHT gives no apple but 3 safe moves.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Long\u2011term planning**  \nEnemy has 19 apples, I have 13. Need to catch up. Eating apple now helps.  \nAfter UP to (7,7), I\u2019ll be at (7,7) with apple (7,7) gone, leaving apples at (0,9), (2,2), (8,9), (8,2).  \nFrom (7,7), I can go UP to (7,8) \u2192 (7,9) \u2192 (8,9) apple path, or go LEFT/DOWN to (2,2).  \nEnemy is on top row, might go for (0,9) or (8,9). If I move toward (8,9) after this, I risk head\u2011on collision later if enemy also moves there. But that\u2019s a future risk, not immediate.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Decision**  \nUP gets apple, keeps good mobility, and progresses toward catching up in score.  \n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nAfter eating apple at (7,7), consider moving toward (8,9) if safe, but check enemy\u2019s possible moves to avoid head\u2011on. If enemy is close to (8,9), maybe go toward (8,2) instead. Keep monitoring enemy\u2019s head location each turn.  \n\nUP",

          "rationale": "Let\u2019s go step by step.  \n\n**Step 1 \u2013 Immediate safety check**  \nMy head at (7,7).  \n- UP to (7,8): within bounds, currently empty (no apple).  \n- DOWN to (7,6): my own body (first segment after head) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- LEFT to (6,7): within bounds, currently empty (no apple).  \n- RIGHT to (8,7): within bounds, currently empty (no apple).  \n\nSafe moves: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Head\u2011on collision risk this turn**  \nEnemy head at (7,9). Its possible moves:  \n- UP to (7,10) \u2192 off board \u2192 unsafe.  \n- DOWN to (7,8) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT to (6,9) \u2192 its own body (segment) \u2192 unsafe.  \n- RIGHT to (8,9) \u2192 apple there, but empty otherwise.  \nSo enemy can move to (7,8) or (8,9).  \nMy candidate cells: (7,8), (6,7), (8,7).  \n(7,8) matches enemy\u2019s possible DOWN move \u2192 head\u2011on collision risk if enemy moves DOWN.  \n(6,7) and (8,7) not in enemy\u2019s possible moves \u2192 safe from head\u2011on this turn.  \n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Apple proximity and future mobility**  \nApples at: (0,9), (2,2), (8,9), (8,2), (6,7).  \nWait \u2014 (6,7) is an apple? Checking: board shows \u201cA\u201d at (6,7) in row 7 (y=7), x=6 \u2014 yes, apple at (6,7).  \nSo:  \n- UP (7,8): no apple.  \n- LEFT (6,7): apple \u2192 grow by 1, score to 15.  \n- RIGHT (8,7): no apple.  \n\nFrom (6,7) after eating apple: next turn, my head will be at (6,7), tail still at (7,1) (since eating adds length, tail doesn\u2019t move).  \nFrom (7,8): next turn UP to (7,9) empty, DOWN to (7,7) my body, LEFT to (6,8) empty, RIGHT to (8,8) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.  \nFrom (6,7) after eating: UP to (6,8) empty, DOWN to (6,6) my body, LEFT to (5,7) empty, RIGHT to (7,7) my body \u2192 2 safe moves.  \nFrom (8,7): UP to (8,8) empty, DOWN to (8,6) empty, LEFT to (7,7) my body, RIGHT to (9,7) empty \u2192 3 safe moves.  \n\nSo LEFT gives apple but reduces mobility next turn to 2 safe moves. UP and RIGHT give no apple but 3 safe moves.  \n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Avoiding head\u2011on**  \nIf enemy moves DOWN to (7,8), and I go UP to (7,8), we collide \u2192 both die. Enemy might choose DOWN because (8,9) is apple but also my body near? Actually enemy head at (7,9) \u2192 RIGHT to (8,9) apple is tempting, but enemy might also choose DOWN to avoid my body? Let\u2019s check enemy\u2019s safe moves:  \nEnemy head at (7,9), body: [(6,9), (5,9), \u2026].  \nEnemy\u2019s safe moves:  \n- DOWN to (7,8): empty.  \n- RIGHT to (8,9): apple, empty.  \nLEFT to (6,9) is its own body. UP off board.  \nSo enemy has 2 safe moves: DOWN and RIGHT.  \nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (8,9), it eats apple. If enemy goes DOWN to (7,8), no apple.  \nEnemy might prefer RIGHT for apple, but not guaranteed.  \n\nIf I go UP to (7,8), there\u2019s a 50% chance enemy goes DOWN \u2192 head\u2011on collision. That\u2019s risky.  \n\n**Step 5 \u2013 Long\u2011term planning**  \nI\u2019m behind 14 vs 19 apples. Need apples, but must survive.  \n(6,7) apple is closest. Eating it gets me to 15.  \n(8,9) apple is close to enemy head \u2014 enemy might get it next turn if it moves RIGHT.  \n(8,2) apple far but reachable later.  \n(2,2) apple far.  \n(0,9) apple far.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (6,7) apple, I avoid head\u2011on risk entirely this turn, gain apple, but next turn mobility is lower.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (8,7), I stay safe from head\u2011on, keep mobility, maybe approach (8,9) apple later if enemy doesn\u2019t take it now.  \n\nBut enemy might eat (8,9) this turn if it moves RIGHT. If enemy eats (8,9), it grows, and my path toward that apple vanishes.  \n\nGiven the risk of head\u2011on with UP, and the apple at (6,7), safest and beneficial move is LEFT.  \n\n**Step 6 \u2013 Decision**  \nLEFT gets apple, avoids head\u2011on collision this turn, improves my score. Next turn I\u2019ll have fewer safe moves, but I can plan then to move upward from (6,7) toward (6,8) to regain space.  \n\nLEFT",

Body: [(6,8), (6,7), \u2026].  \n- Enemy snake head at (9,8).  \n- Apples: (0,9), (2,2), (8,2), (0,6), (9,5).  \n\n**Possible moves from (5,8):**  \n- UP \u2192 (5,9): board shows (5,9) is occupied by enemy #1\u2019s body (T = tail part of snake #1). Actually checking: enemy body list includes (5,9) yes, it\u2019s in snake #1\u2019s body. So UP hits enemy body \u2192 death.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (5,7): board shows (5,7) is empty (dot). But my own body? My body: (6,8), (6,7), (7,7), \u2026 No (5,7) in my body. Enemy body? Snake #1 body: includes (4,7), (3,7), etc. Not (5,7). So DOWN is safe *if* no head collision.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (4,8): board shows (4,8) is enemy body? Snake #1 body: (4,9), (4,8), (4,7) \u2192 yes, (4,8) is occupied by snake #1\u2019s body \u2192 death.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (6,8): board shows (6,8) is my own body (first segment after head). So moving RIGHT hits own body \u2192 death.  \n\nSo only DOWN is safe from immediate self-collision or enemy body collision.  \n\n**But check enemy head movement for head-on collision:**  \nEnemy head at (9,8). Possible moves for enemy:  \n- UP \u2192 (9,9): board shows empty? Board row 9 col 9: row 9: \"A . . . T T T T T .\" \u2192 col 9 is dot, so empty. Safe for them? Their body: (8,9) is occupied by them, (9,9) empty.  \n- DOWN \u2192 (9,7): board shows (9,7) empty.  \n- LEFT \u2192 (8,8): board shows (8,8) is their own body? Their body list: (8,8) is second segment after head, so moving LEFT hits their own body \u2192 they wouldn\u2019t choose that unless forced. But they might not be rational, but game rules: they move simultaneously, we must assume they might move any direction.  \n\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (9,7), no conflict.  \nIf enemy moves UP to (9,9), no conflict.  \nIf enemy moves LEFT to (8,8), they die immediately (into their own body).  \nIf enemy moves RIGHT \u2192 off board (10,8) \u2192 death.  \n\nSo enemy\u2019s only safe moves are UP or DOWN. Neither leads to (5,7) where I\u2019d go. So no head-on collision possible if I go DOWN.  \n\nSo DOWN is safe.  \n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nCurrently behind in apples (16 vs 20). Need to target apples while staying safe. Apples at (0,9) unreachable soon (enemy near), (2,2) possible but far, (8,2) possible, (0,6) possible, (9,5) near enemy head.  \nAfter DOWN to (5,7), I can consider going toward (8,2) via right/down moves, avoiding trapping myself. Need to keep distance from enemy head (9,8).  \n\n**Final move:**  \nDOWN",

So from (5,5), only safe next moves are LEFT (4,5) and DOWN (5,4). That\u2019s only 2 safe options.\n\n- **LEFT to (4,6)** \u2192 next moves: UP (4,7) enemy body, DOWN (4,5) empty, LEFT (3,6) empty, RIGHT (5,6) my neck after move (occupied). So safe next moves: DOWN, LEFT. Also 2 options.\n\n- **RIGHT to (6,6)** \u2192 next moves: UP (6,7) my body, DOWN (6,5) my body, LEFT (5,6) my neck, RIGHT (7,6) my body? Wait, check new body after moving right: head at (6,6), body: [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (6,8), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0), (6,0), (7,0)] \u2014 (7,6) is occupied, so only DOWN? Actually DOWN (6,5) occupied, so no safe moves from (6,6) at all next turn! **RIGHT is a trap** \u2014 eliminates itself after moving.  \n\nSo RIGHT is unsafe for future.\n\n---\n\n**Compare DOWN vs LEFT:**  \n\nFrom (5,5) after DOWN:  \n- Can go LEFT to (4,5) then towards (0,6) or (2,2).  \n- Can go DOWN to (5,4) then towards (8,2) or continue left.\n\nFrom (4,6) after LEFT:  \n- Can go DOWN to (4,5) (same as above)  \n- Can go LEFT to (3,6) then down toward (2,2)  \n\nBoth give 2 options next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple proximity:**  \nClosest apple is (8,2) or (0,6) in terms of steps.  \nFrom (5,5) vs (4,6):  \nTo (8,2): from (5,5) is 3 right + 3 down = 6 steps; from (4,6) is 4 right + 4 down = 8 steps.  \nTo (0,6): from (5,5) is 5 left + 1 up = 6 steps; from (4,6) is 4 left = 4 steps.  \n\nLEFT puts me closer to (0,6), which enemy might not go for (they are on right side).  \n\nAlso, enemy is long (length 21 vs my 17), could block area near (0,9) but (0,6) is relatively safe if I get there first.\n\n---\n\n**Risk of enemy cutting me off:**  \nEnemy head at (9,6) going to (8,6) or (9,5) \u2014 not threatening my immediate path to (0,6).  \n\n---\n\n**Choice:**  \nLEFT seems better \u2014 closer to (0,6) apple, avoids moving into more congested right side where my body is.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turns:**  \nFrom (4,6), go LEFT next turn to (3,6), then down toward (2,2) or continue left to (0,6).

Not safe.  \n- **DOWN** \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 board shows empty (no '0','1','T','A'). Safe.  \n- **LEFT** \u2192 (3,5) \u2192 board shows empty. Safe.  \n- **RIGHT** \u2192 (5,5) \u2192 board shows empty. Safe.  \n\nSo safe moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy possible moves from (8,5):**  \nEnemy body: [(9,5), (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (8,8), \u2026]  \n- UP (8,6) \u2192 empty? Board shows 'T' at (8,6)? Let's check: enemy body list has (8,8), (8,9), (7,9), (6,9), \u2026 no (8,6). So empty.  \n- DOWN (8,4) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (7,5) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (9,5) \u2192 enemy's own body (second segment). Not safe.  \n\nSo enemy can go UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n\n---\n\n**Check head-on collisions:**  \nMy safe destinations: (4,4), (3,5), (5,5)  \nEnemy possible destinations: (8,6), (8,4), (7,5)  \n\nNo overlap \u2192 no immediate head-on risk.  \n\n---\n\n**Future safety after each move:**  \n\n1. **DOWN to (4,4):**  \nNext turn from (4,4):  \n- UP (4,5) \u2192 my old head location? No, my body after move will be: head at (4,4), then (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), \u2026 Wait, careful:  \nCurrent body: [(4,6), (5,6), \u2026 up to (5,0)], tail at (5,0). After moving DOWN, head goes to (4,4), body becomes: [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), \u2026 (5,0), (6,0)]? Actually last segment before move is (5,0), tail at (5,0). After move, tail stays unless apple eaten. So body: [(4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), \u2026, (5,0)].  \nSo (4,5) is my neck, occupied next turn. UP not safe.  \n- DOWN (4,3) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (3,4) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (5,4) \u2192 empty? Board shows 'T' at (5,4)? No, (5,4) is empty currently, and after move my body has (5,4)? Let's check: my body after move: (4,5) neck, (4,6), (5,6), \u2026 (5,4) is not in that list until we go down to (5,4)? Actually (5,4) is in current body list: yes, (6,4) is in current body, but (5,4) is not in current body? Wait current body: (4,6), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0). Yes! (5,4) is in current body (12th segment). So after moving DOWN, body shifts: head at (4,4), then (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), \u2026 (5,4) will be one before tail? Let's trace: old body minus tail (5,0) shifts: (4,6) becomes second body segment after head? Actually:  \nNew head: (4,4)  \nNeck: (4,5)  \nThen old segments: (4,6), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (6,5), (6,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0)  \nSo (5,4) is in there, but at position: counting from head: 0:(4,4), 1:(4,5), 2:(4,6), 3:(5,6), 4:(5,7), 5:(5,8), 6:(6,8), 7:(6,7), 8:(7,7), 9:(7,6), 10:(7,5), 11:(6,5), 12:(6,4), 13:(5,4), 14:(5,3), 15:(5,2), 16:(5,1), tail (5,0) gone. Wait length is 17 before move, after move without apple tail disappears so length stays 17? Actually: moving without apple: head new pos, all segments shift, tail cell vacated. So body length stays 17. So last segment was (5,0), now gone. So (5,4) is index 13 from head, so yes (5,4) occupied. So RIGHT to (5,4) not safe.  \n\nSo from (4,4) safe moves: DOWN, LEFT only.  \n\n---\n\n2. **LEFT to (3,5):**  \nAfter move body: [(3,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), \u2026 (5,0)]  \nNext turn from (3,5):  \n- UP (3,6) \u2192 empty? Board shows empty currently, but after move? Not occupied by my new body. Safe.  \n- DOWN (3,4) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (2,5) \u2192 empty.  \n- RIGHT (4,5) \u2192 my neck, occupied. Not safe.  \n\nSo from (3,5) safe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT (3 options).  \n\n---\n\n3. **RIGHT to (5,5):**  \nAfter move body: [(5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), \u2026 (5,0)]  \nNext turn from (5,5):  \n- UP (5,6) \u2192 occupied by my body (3rd segment). Not safe.  \n- DOWN (5,4) \u2192 occupied by my body (index down list). Yes, (5,4) is in body after move. Not safe.  \n- LEFT (4,5) \u2192 my neck, occupied. Not safe.  \n- RIGHT (6,5) \u2192 occupied by my body? Check: after move body: (5,5), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,7), \u2026 (6,5) appears later? Current body has (6,5) at some point. Let's check: current body has (6,5) at index 9 from head? Actually current body: (4,6), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (6,5), \u2026 yes (6,5) is there. After move: (5,5) head, (4,5) neck, (4,6), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (6,5), \u2026 So (6,5) is index 11 from head, so occupied. So RIGHT not safe.  \n\nSo from (5,5) no safe moves next turn! That\u2019s a deathtrap.  \n\nSo RIGHT is unsafe in the follow-up sense.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nFrom (4,5):  \nClosest apples:  \n- (2,2): distance 4  \n- (0,6): distance 5  \n- (8,2): distance 7  \n- (1,0): distance 8  \n- (0,9): distance 10  \n\nFrom (3,5): closer to (0,6) and (2,2).  \nFrom (4,4): closer to (2,2).  \n\nLEFT (3,5) gives 3 safe moves next turn and is closer to two apples. DOWN (4,4) gives only 2 safe moves next turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy movement consideration:**  \nEnemy at (8,5) could go UP/DOWN/LEFT. If they go LEFT to (7,5), they move toward center but not threatening my immediate area. Their long body blocks top right, so I should avoid that region.  \n\nLEFT seems better for future options and apple access.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan:**  \nGo LEFT to (3,5), then next turn likely go LEFT again to (2,5) toward apple (2,2) or DOWN/UP toward (0,6). Keep options open, avoid moving into enemy body zone top-right.  \n\n---\n\nLEFT",
