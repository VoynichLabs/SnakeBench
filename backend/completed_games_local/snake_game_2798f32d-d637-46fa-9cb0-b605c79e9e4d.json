All paths to nearest apple (6,5) are clear and equidistant (5 moves via row 4 east then up, or up then east along row 5). RIGHT continues uncoiling to horizontal at y=4, freeing tail at (1,3) and optimizing for eastward momentum toward (6,5) without zigzags. UP would leave a bent shape with (1,4) protruding; DOWN diverts south prematurely, increasing distance to (6,5) and risking y=2 cluster congestion later. Enemy far northeast, no immediate collision risk; likely pursuing (5,9) apple independently. RIGHT prioritizes growth and flexibility.  \n**END RATIONALE**  \n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**  \nThis turn: RIGHT to (3,4), extend horizontal. Next 3 turns: RIGHT to (4,4), RIGHT (5,4), RIGHT (6,4); then UP to (6,5) eat/grow to length 4. After eating, if enemy heads south, maneuver RIGHT/DOWN toward y=2 cluster ((7,2)/(9,2)); if enemy stays north, secure (6,2) via DOWN then RIGHT. Maintain open paths, avoid body overlap; target 5+ apples by turn 30.  \n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**  \nRIGHT",
