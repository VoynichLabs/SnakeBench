Moving RIGHT gets me positioned to approach this cluster. My plan for the next few turns:\n1. Move RIGHT to (5, 3)\n2. Then move DOWN to start collecting the cluster of apples around (5, 2), (4, 1), (5, 0)\n3. Stay vigilant about enemy snake movements, though it's currently far away at (0, 0)\n\nRIGHT is the optimal first move as it positions me well for collecting nearby apples while maintaining board safety and future flexibility.\n\nRIGHT",

Moving RIGHT to (1, 0) gives me access to more apples in the bottom row and keeps me aligned with the apple at (1, 2). Moving RIGHT also provides me with better long-term positioning since the bottom row has multiple apples that are directly accessible.\n\nThe enemy snake at (4, 3) is far enough that there's no immediate collision risk regardless of which direction I choose.\n\nI'll move RIGHT to get better positioning for accessing multiple apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Gain 1 point\n   - Very safe - no collision risks\n   - Opens up future moves to (5, 0), (4, 1), (4, 0)\n   - Enemy at (1, 0) won't interfere\n\n2. **UP**: Move to (5, 4)\n   - Safe, moves away from dense apple cluster\n   - Less efficient than DOWN\n\n3. **LEFT**: Move to (4, 3)\n   - Safe but moves laterally\n   - Still far from immediate apples\n   - Less efficient than DOWN\n\n4. **RIGHT**: Move to (6, 3)\n   - Safe but moves away from apple cluster\n   - Less efficient than DOWN\n\n**Decision:**\nDOWN is clearly the best move. It takes me directly to an apple at (5, 2), which is my closest apple. Collecting it immediately grows my snake and starts building momentum.\n\n**Long-term strategy for next turns:**\nAfter eating at (5, 2), focus on the vertical apple chain below: (5, 0), (4, 1), (4, 0). The enemy snake at (1, 0) is far away and moving slowly. Prioritize the dense apple clusters in the lower-left quadrant while staying safe from the enemy snake's potential path.\n\nDOWN",

The enemy snake is far away in the bottom-right corner (head at 6,0).\n2. The closest apple cluster is in the top-left region: (2, 7), (0, 8), (3, 9).\n3. UP to (1, 7) gets me closer to (2, 7) (now only 1 step away) and (0, 8) (now 2 steps away).\n4. From (1, 7), I'll have 4 safe follow-up options including RIGHT to eat the apple at (2, 7).\n5. The enemy seems likely to collect apples on the right side of the board; going UP allows me to target apples in the safer top-left area.\n\n**Move comparison:**\n- UP to (1, 7): Moves toward top-left apple cluster, maintains good follow-up options, keeps distance from enemy - GOOD\n- LEFT to (0, 6): Moves toward some apples but reduces follow-up options (can't go LEFT again) - OK\n- RIGHT to (2, 6): Moves toward right-side apples where enemy is operating - RISKIER\n\nUP is the best move to safely approach the nearest apple cluster while maintaining flexibility.\n\nPlan: Move UP toward (2, 7), eat that apple, then continue collecting apples in the top-left region (0,8), (3,9), etc. while monitoring enemy movements.\n\nUP",

Getting closer to the dense upper cluster.\n- LEFT to (5, 3): Moves toward apples at (3, 1), (3, 0), (5, 6). Less direct path to main cluster.\n- RIGHT to (7, 3): Moves toward apples at (8, 5), (8, 7), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1).

If enemy moves UP, they go to (3, 8). If they move DOWN, they go to (3, 6). No immediate collision threat from my planned moves.\n\n**Analysis:**\nUP is the best choice because:\n1. It continues the northward sweep toward the densest apple cluster\n2. Maintains maximum maneuverability and escape routes\n3. Positions me well for efficient apple collection\n4. Avoids the edge entrapment risk of moving RIGHT\n5. Keeps the board center open for future movements\n\n**Long-term plan:** Continue moving UP toward rows 6-8 to collect the apple cluster at (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 6), (6, 8), (8, 7). Once in that region, I'll prioritize collecting multiple apples while maintaining at least 2-3 directional options to avoid being cornered.

Distance to (7, 6) is 1 step. This positions me perfectly adjacent to two apples!\n- LEFT to (5, 5): Distance to (5, 6) is 1 step. Good access to that apple, but less optimal than UP.\n- RIGHT to (7, 5): Distance to (8, 5) is 1 step, (7, 6) is 1 step. Also good positioning.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\nUP is the strongest move because:\n1. It moves me directly toward the densest apple cluster (rows 6-8)\n2. From (6, 6), I can reach (6, 7) next turn or (7, 6)\n3. This maintains the efficient northward sweep I've been executing\n4. Keeps maximum flexibility with multiple adjacent apples\n5. Enemy is at (3, 9), far from my path - no collision threat\n\n**Future Plan (next 3-5 turns):**\nFrom (6, 6), continue harvesting the cluster:\n- Priority targets: (6, 7), (7, 6), (8, 7), (8, 5), (6, 8)\n- Maintain a northern/eastern bias toward high-density apple regions\n- Continue score accumulation (currently 5 apples vs enemy's 4 - I'm ahead)\n- Monitor enemy position at (3, 9) - they're moving away from me, so low collision risk\n- Goal: reach 50 apples and win before turn 150\n\nUP",

It positions me in a resource-rich area where I can secure apples like (7, 9) and (8, 7), rather than moving left into a sparse area. Even though the enemy will likely claim some of the closer apples on the right, there are enough there for both of us, and I need to compete to catch up on the score (4 vs 5).\n\nRIGHT",

It guarantees me an apple at (7, 9) on the next turn that the enemy can't contest, while moving me away from their controlled column 6. The top-right region has multiple apples, and being in the corner gives me safe boundaries. Going DOWN leaves me competing for apples in the enemy's territory where their long body along column 6 restricts my options.\n\nRIGHT",

Eating the apple will make my snake grow by 1\n- After eating, my head moves to (8, 7) with the rest of my body extended\n- I'll then have 8 apples to enemy's 5\n- Opens up movement down the right side where apples are clustered: (8, 5), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1)\n- Safe movement path exists\n\nRIGHT to (9, 8):\n- No immediate apple\n- Moves me to the right edge of the board\n- Limits future moves to UP, DOWN, or LEFT only\n- Less flexibility\n\n**Decision:**\nDOWN is clearly superior - it gives me an immediate apple and continues my position on the right side with good access to the apple cluster below. This increases my lead from 7-5 to 8-5.\n\n**Next Turn Plan (for future self):**\nAfter eating at (8, 7), continue DOWN the right edge to collect (8, 5), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1). The enemy is in the top area and my path on the right side is clear. Current score advantage: 8-5. Need 42 more apples with 133 turns remaining.\n\nDOWN",

Even if the enemy moves away, their neck (currently at 7, 8) will move into (8, 8) simultaneously. Moving here results in colliding with their body. **UNSAFE**\n- LEFT: (7, 9) \u2192 My own body. **INVALID**\n- RIGHT: (9, 9) \u2192 Empty cell. **SAFE**\n\n**Analysis:**\nI am trapped in the top-right corner with limited options. UP is out of bounds, LEFT is my own body, and DOWN leads into the enemy (head or body). The only viable move to stay alive this turn is RIGHT into the empty corner at (9, 9).\n\n**Strategy Note:**\nMoving to (9, 9) is forced. Next turn, I will likely have to move DOWN to (9, 8). Since the enemy is at (8, 8), I must be cautious of a potential head-on collision if they choose to move RIGHT on the same turn I move DOWN.

The vertical line of apples at x=9 [(9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3)] is my primary target. Moving down maintains my positional advantage while keeping me away from the enemy snake.\n\nThe enemy at (9, 8) is attempting to contest the right edge, but by moving DOWN, I maintain control and can continue collecting the easy apple cluster.\n\n**Long-term plan for next turns:** Continue moving DOWN the right edge to collect apples at (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2), (9, 1) in sequence. This maintains my 3-apple lead and keeps me in safe territory away from the enemy. Monitor enemy position and be prepared to pivot LEFT if the enemy gets too close.\n\nDOWN",

I win immediately since all opponents are dead.\n- If enemy moves DOWN to (9, 6): Both snakes survive. My head at (9, 7) and their head at (9, 6).\n\nIn both cases, moving DOWN to (9, 7) keeps me alive and potentially wins the game if the enemy moves UP.\n\n**Strategic consideration:**\nFrom (9, 7), I'll be positioned to continue moving down along the right edge toward apples at (9, 3) and (9, 2), which are 4-5 cells away. This gives me a clear path to collect apples.\n\nDOWN",
