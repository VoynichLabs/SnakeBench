Yes\n   - Body collision? No\n   - Enemy body? No\n   - Safe? Yes\n\nAll four directions are immediately safe.

It directly approaches the closest apple at (1,4)\n2. It keeps me near the left edge where I have maneuvering room\n3. It positions me to access multiple apples in the upper region\n4. It maintains the most future options\n5. Moving toward apples is essential to winning\n\n**Long-term plan**: Head toward the apple at (1,4), then consider the cluster at (3,4)/(4,3) while monitoring enemy position to avoid collisions.\n\nUP",

Safe.\n2. **DOWN**: (1,1) - This is my tail! That's moving backwards into my own body, which is lethal. DEADLY.\n3. **LEFT**: (0,2) - Valid, no collision. Safe.\n4. **RIGHT**: (2,2) - Valid, no collision. Safe.\n\nSo DOWN is immediately fatal. I must avoid it.\n\nNow comparing the three safe moves:\n- **UP to (1,3)**: Gets me 1 step closer to apple at (1,4), opening up path to that apple. From (1,3), I could reach (1,4) next turn and eat the apple. Also positions me to potentially go for (3,4) or (0,9) later.\n- **LEFT to (0,2)**: Moves me away from the apple cluster. From here, I could only go for (0,9) which is far away.\n- **RIGHT to (2,2)**: Puts me in the middle of the board. From here, (1,4) is 2 up and 1 left, (3,4) is 1 up and 1 right, (4,3) is 1 down and 2 right (but blocked by enemy). This gives good options but doesn't directly approach the nearest apple.\n\nThe enemy is at (4,3). If they move UP to (4,4), they'd be closer to (3,4) and (4,3) is no longer blocking. If they move LEFT to (3,3) they'd be moving into their own body (death). If they move RIGHT to (5,3) they go away from apples. If they move DOWN to (4,2) they also move away.\n\nThe apple at (1,4) seems safest to target since enemy is not immediately near it. UP maximizes my chance of reaching it first.\n\nLong-term plan: Move UP toward apple at (1,4), eat it next turn if possible, then reassess based on enemy position and remaining apples.\n\nUP",

They are at the same location as the apple at (4,4) was. They likely just ate that apple or moved into it.\n- Apples available: (0,9), (6,7), (3,4), (3,8). The apple at (1,4) is gone (eaten by me). The apple at (4,4) is gone (eaten by snake #0).\n- My current body segments are (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). The tail is at (1,1).\n\nEvaluating safety (Collision with self):\n- My tail is at (1,1).\n- Moving **DOWN** to (1,2): This cell contains my body segment (1,2). This is a collision. DEADLY.\n- Moving **UP** to (1,4): This cell is currently empty (I ate the apple there). It's safe from my own body.\n- Moving **LEFT** to (0,3): This cell is empty. It's safe from my own body.\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (2,3): This cell is empty. It's safe from my own body.\n\nCollision with enemy snake #0:\n- Enemy head is at (4,4), body at (4,3).\n- My potential moves:\n  - UP to (1,4): Distance to enemy head is large. Safe.\n  - LEFT to (0,3): Distance to enemy head is large. Safe.\n  - RIGHT to (2,3): Distance to enemy head is large. Safe.\n- All moves are safe from immediate collision with the enemy.\n\nStrategic evaluation:\n- **UP to (1,4)**: Moves me to a cell where I just ate an apple. From (1,4), I can see apples at (3,4) (2 right) and (0,9) (up). The enemy is at (4,4). If the enemy moves UP or RIGHT, they are heading away from (3,4). If they move LEFT, they approach (3,4). However, from (1,4), I am close to (3,4).\n- **LEFT to (0,3)**: Moves me to the edge of the board. From (0,3), I can go UP towards (0,9). This path is long. I would be trapped on the left wall.\n- **RIGHT to (2,3)**: Moves me closer to the center. From (2,3), I am 1 step away from (3,3) and 2 steps away from (3,4). This is a good position to contest the apple at (3,4). From (2,3), if I go RIGHT next, I get to (3,3), then UP to (3,4). The enemy is at (4,4). The enemy is 1 step away from (3,4) (LEFT) or 1 step away from (4,3) (DOWN, but that is their body). If the enemy moves LEFT to (3,4), they eat the apple. If I move RIGHT to (2,3) this turn, I am positioned to potentially intercept or move towards other apples.\n\nWait, let's re-read the board state carefully.\nCurrent Board:\n 9 A . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . A . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . A . . .\n 6 . . . . . . . . . .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . A . A 0 . . . . .\n 3 . 1 . . T . . . . .\n 2 . . . . . . . . . .\n 1 . . . . . . . . . .\n 0 . . . . . . . . . .\n\nMy Head: (1,3)\nMy Body: (1,2), (1,1) -> Tail at (1,1)\n\nLet's look at the apples again: (0,9), (6,7), (3,4), (3,8).\nApple (3,4) is the closest.\nMy potential moves:\n1. UP (1,4) - Cell is empty.\n2. LEFT (0,3) - Cell is empty.\n3. RIGHT (2,3) - Cell is empty.\n4. DOWN (1,2) - Cell is occupied by my body (1,2). INVALID.\n\nTargeting (3,4):\n- From (1,3), if I move RIGHT to (2,3), I am 1 unit away from (3,3) and 2 units away from (3,4).\n- If I move UP to (1,4), I am 2 units away from (3,4) (RIGHT, RIGHT).\n- From (2,3), the path to (3,4) is clear (RIGHT, UP).\n- From (1,4), the path to (3,4) is clear (RIGHT, RIGHT).\n\nEnemy analysis:\nSnake #0: Head (4,4), Body (4,3).\nFrom (4,4), the enemy can go:\n- UP (4,5): Safe.\n- DOWN (4,3): Blocked by its own body. INVALID.\n- LEFT (3,4): Apple (3,4) is here. Good move for them.\n- RIGHT (5,4): Safe.\n\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (3,4), they will eat the apple. If I move RIGHT to (2,3) this turn, and the enemy moves LEFT to (3,4), next turn I can move RIGHT to (3,3). The enemy, having grown, will have its tail at (4,4). If they stay at (3,4), I could potentially attack. However, if they eat (3,4), they grow. The apple disappears. I need to move to intercept.\n\nLet's compare UP vs RIGHT:\n- UP (1,4): Puts me at the same height as the apple (3,4). I am 2 steps away.\n- RIGHT (2,3): Puts me 1 step closer to (3,4). I am 1 step away from x=3.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I am closing the distance to the apple and the enemy. The enemy is at (4,4). If they move LEFT to (3,4), they take the apple. If I move RIGHT to (2,3), I am in a good position to move to (3,3) next. From (3,3), I can move UP to (3,4) if it's still there (unlikely if enemy moves left), or move to (3,2) or (2,3) or (4,3). If the enemy moves UP to (4,5), they go away from the apple. If I move RIGHT to (2,3), I maintain pressure.\n\nIf I move UP to (1,4), I am equidistant to (3,4) compared to (2,3)? No.\nFrom (1,4) to (3,4): 2 moves (Right, Right).\nFrom (2,3) to (3,4): 2 moves (Right, Up).\nFrom (1,3) to (3,4): Manhattan distance is 3.\nFrom (2,3) to (3,4): Manhattan distance is 2.\nFrom (1,4) to (3,4): Manhattan distance is 2.\n\nSo both (1,4) and (2,3) are 2 moves away from (3,4).\nHowever, (2,3) is closer to the enemy's potential path. The enemy is at (4,4). The apple is at (3,4). The enemy is 1 step away.\nI am 2 steps away.\nI cannot beat the enemy to (3,4) if they want to take it.\nHowever, moving RIGHT puts me in a position to potentially cut off the enemy or move towards (3,8) or (6,7) if (3,4) is taken.\nMoving UP puts me near the wall. (1,4) is next to the wall. (2,3) is more central.\n(2,3) offers better mobility.\nAlso, looking at the board:\n(1,4) is directly above (1,3). If I go there, my body will be (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). This is a vertical line.\nIf I go RIGHT to (2,3), my body will be (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). This is an L-shape.\nThe L-shape is generally better for maneuverability than a straight line against a wall.\n\nLet's reconsider the target.\nApple (3,8) is at y=8.\nApple (6,7) is at y=7.\nApple (3,4) is at y=4.\nApple (0,9) is at y=9.\n\nIf the enemy takes (3,4), I should target (3,8) or (6,7) or (0,9).\n(0,9) is very far and against the wall.\n(6,7) is far.\n(3,8) is closer.\nFrom (1,3), (3,8) is far.\nFrom (2,3), (3,8) is slightly closer.\n\nLet's look at the \"Rules and win conditions\".\n\"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point (1 apple).\"\n\"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\"\n\"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die.\"\n\nI need to be careful about head-on collisions. The enemy is at (4,4). I am at (1,3). We are far apart.\n\nDecision:\nMoving **RIGHT** to (2,3) seems the most flexible. It keeps me away from the wall and keeps the path to (3,4) open (even though the enemy might take it). It also keeps me in range of other apples.\nIf I move UP to (1,4), I am \"walled off\" to the left.\nIf I move RIGHT, I can potentially go UP or LEFT or RIGHT next turn.\n\nLet's double check the safety of (2,3).\nMy body parts: (1,3), (1,2), (1,1).\n(2,3) is not in that list. Safe.\nEnemy body: (4,3).\n(2,3) is not in that list. Safe.\nBoard bounds: 0-9. (2,3) is valid.\n\nIs there any reason to go UP?\nIf I go UP, I am heading directly towards the apple at (3,4) via (1,4)->(2,4)->(3,4).\nIf I go RIGHT, I am heading towards (3,4) via (2,3)->(3,3)->(3,4).\nThe path via RIGHT allows me to swing wide if needed.\nAlso, if the enemy moves DOWN (invalid) or RIGHT, they leave (3,4) open. If they move LEFT, they take it.\nGiven the enemy is at (4,4), they are likely to take (3,4).\nI should position myself to eat the *next* apple.\nThe apples are at (0,9), (6,7), (3,8).\n(3,8) is interesting. It's on x=3, y=8.\nIf I move RIGHT to (2,3), I can eventually go UP to (2,8) then LEFT to (3,8).\nIf I move UP to (1,4), I can go RIGHT to (2,4) then UP to (2,8) then RIGHT to (3,8). Actually, (3,8) is at x=3, y=8. (1,4) is x=1, y=4. To get to (3,8), I need +2 x, +4 y.\nFrom (2,3), I need +1 x, +5 y.\nFrom (1,4), I need +2 x, +4 y.\nThey are very similar distances to (3,8).\nHowever, (2,3) is more central.\nAlso, if I go RIGHT, I am closer to (3,4) to potentially \"steal\" it if the enemy hesitates or if I can block them.\nBut since the enemy is 1 step away, they will likely get it.\nThe most important thing is to not die.\nDOWN is death (into tail).\nUP, LEFT, RIGHT are safe.\nAmong UP, LEFT, RIGHT:\n- LEFT (0,3): Bad, wall.\n- UP (1,4): Good, towards apples.\n- RIGHT (2,3): Good, central.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nIf I go UP, my head is at (1,4). My body fills (1,3), (1,2), (1,1).\nIf I go RIGHT, my head is at (2,3). My body fills (1,3), (1,2), (1,1).\nThe cell (1,4) is marked as \"A\" in the previous board state. I ate it. It is now empty.\nThe cell (3,4) is marked as \"A\". It is still there.\nThe cell (4,4) is marked as \"0\" (Enemy head).\n\nI will move RIGHT. It provides better central control and avoids the wall.\n\nOne final check: The turn is 2/150.\nTurn 1: I likely moved UP from (1,1) to (1,2) or something. Wait, the \"Last move information\" says \"UP\" and \"My position: (1,2) with body extending to (1,1)\". That was turn 1.\nTurn 2 (Now): I am at (1,3).\nSo I have moved UP once.\nIf I continue UP, I am going straight.\nIf I turn RIGHT, I am branching out.\n\nI'll stick with RIGHT for flexibility.\n\nPlan for next turn:\nMove to (2,3). Assess enemy movement. If enemy takes (3,4), target (3,8). If enemy moves away from (3,4), try to take (3,4) or (6,7).\n\nRIGHT\n**END LAST RATIONALE**",

I just moved RIGHT from (1, 3).\n- **Enemy Snake #0:** Head at (5, 4), Body: [(4, 4), (4, 3)], Apples: 2.\n- **Board State:**\n  - Enemy #0 moved RIGHT from (4, 4) to (5, 4).\n  - Apple at (3, 4) was NOT eaten. It remains on the board.\n  - Apples available: (0, 9), (6, 7), (3, 4), (3, 8).\n- **Distance to Apple (3, 4):**\n  - My Manhattan distance: |2-3| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2 moves.\n  - Enemy Manhattan distance: |5-3| + |4-4| = 2 + 0 = 2 moves.\n  - We are equidistant. However, the enemy is blocked by my body if I claim the path. If I move UP, I occupy (2, 4). The enemy is at (5, 4). To reach (3, 4), the enemy would have to pass through (4, 4), which is currently its own tail (unless it moves). Actually, the enemy's tail is at (4, 3). The segment at (4, 4) remains for one turn. If the enemy moves to (4, 4), it hits its own tail. If it moves to (3, 4), it has to move LEFT twice. I am at (2, 3).\n- **Strategy:**\n  - If I move UP to (2, 4), I am 1 move away from (3, 4) (via RIGHT).\n  - If I move RIGHT to (3, 3), I am 1 move away from (3, 4) (via UP).\n  - Moving UP seems safer because it blocks the path for the enemy (y=4 row). The enemy is at x=5. If I move UP, I cover x=2. The enemy is blocked by its own body at x=4 and x=4 (temporarily). Moving UP puts me closer to the other apples (3, 8) and keeps me away from the right wall where I might get trapped.\n  - Check Safety of (2, 4):\n    - On Board: Yes.\n    - Own Body: (1,3), (1,2), (1,1). No.\n    - Enemy Body: (4,4), (4,3). No.\n    - Enemy Head: (5,4). Collision possible? Enemy moves simultaneously. If I go UP, enemy might go LEFT to (4,4). (2,4) != (4,4). Safe. If enemy goes UP/DOWN/RIGHT, distance increases.\n  - Moving UP maximizes chance to get (3,4) and sets up a run towards (3,8).\n\n**DECISION:** Move UP to (2, 4) to contest the apple and block the enemy's path.\n\nUP",
