(5, 8) is 4 steps away.\n\nLet's evaluate moves based on proximity to apples (4, 8) and (5, 8).\n\n*   UP (1, 9): Generally safe, but moves away from the cluster of apples at y=8.\n*   DOWN (1, 7): Moves away from the y=8 apples.\n*   LEFT (0, 8): Moves away from the y=8 apples.\n*   RIGHT (2, 8): Moves directly towards the group of apples at y=8.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (2, 8) seems best, setting me up for subsequent moves towards (4, 8) or (5, 8).\n\nLong-term plan: Move right along the y=8 row to collect the apples at (4, 8) and (5, 8), and potentially (8, 7) later.\n\nRIGHT",

Fewer immediate options in a tight left boundary.\n- RIGHT to (3,1): Directly positions me in the heart of the apple cluster (apples at (4,1), (4,2), (3,3), (4,0) are all within 1-2 moves). Maximizes future directions (up, right, down) in an open area, avoiding the left wall. Enemy at (1,8) is far and their next move is unpredictable, but this avoids potential paths they might take if moving down.\n\nPrioritizing proximity to multiple safe apples and open space, RIGHT is the best choice.\n\n**Long-term plan for next few turns:** Focus on eating apples in the x=3-4 cluster first ((4,1), (4,0), (3,3), etc.) to grow early without risking tight spots, then aim left toward x=0-2 for more apples while watching enemy movements to avoid head-on collisions in middle rows.\n\nRIGHT",

Yes. (Doesn't hit own body (4, 8)).\n    *   Pros: Keeps options open.\n    *   Cons: Moves away from the apple cluster I'm targeting.\n3.  **LEFT (4, 8):**\n    *   **DANGER:** (4, 8) is the first segment of your body. Moving into it is immediately fatal, even though the tail is at (3, 8). **FATAL.**\n4.  **RIGHT (6, 8):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (Doesn't hit board edge, enemy, or own body).\n    *   Pros: Direct path towards (8, 7). Pushes high and right immediately.

It maintains the high position and is more direct towards the target cluster.\n*   **UP (5, 9):** Provides more vertical space but requires moving right later: (6, 9) then (7, 9) or (6, 8) then (7, 8).\n\nSince the path via RIGHT is more direct and high up, it is the superior choice for apple acquisition. The risk of head-on collision is negligible, as Enemy 0 is far away at (3, 2).\n\n**Move Selection:** RIGHT to (6, 8).\n\n**Long-term strategy note for Turn 5:**\nHead will be at (6, 8). Target apple is (8, 7). Next move should be either (7, 8) or (6, 7). (7, 8) seems best to facilitate eating (8, 7) or (7, 6) next. The enemy is still low and central.

Apples: 2.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head (H0): (3, 3). Body (B0): [(3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 1)]. Length 4. Apples: 3.\n    *   Enemy 0 is now longer than us (length 4 vs 3) and has one more apple (3 vs 2). The enemy just ate an apple (likely at (3, 3) where the move before last was), or it moved into an apple at (3, 3) this turn. The apple at (3, 3) is now gone.\n\n*   **Apples (A):** (3, 5), (6, 6), (4, 0), (0, 5), (8, 7), (2, 3), (8, 2), (5, 2), (9, 5), (3, 4), (7, 6), (7, 4), (1, 4), (2, 8), (3, 9). Total 15 apples remaining.\n\n**Strategic Goal:** We are positioned high and slightly right. The nearest and most enticing cluster is high right: (8, 7), (9, 5), and (6, 6). The immediate target is (8, 7).\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves from (6, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP (6, 9):**\n    *   Safe? Yes. (Doesn't hit edge 9, own body, or enemy).\n    *   Pros: Maintains high position, allows movement to the right edge (9, 9 or 8, 9) next turn.\n2.  **DOWN (6, 7):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Pros: Moves directly towards apples (8, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6). Shortest physical path to (8, 7).\n3.  **LEFT (5, 8):**\n    *   **DANGER:** (5, 8) is the first segment of your body. Moving into it is immediately fatal. **FATAL.**\n4.  **RIGHT (7, 8):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Pros: Closer to the high-right cluster, specifically (8, 7). Direct path towards the target.\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (UP, DOWN, RIGHT):**\n\n*   **Target Apple (8, 7):**\n    *   (6, 9) -> (7, 9) or (6, 7/8). Requires at least 2 more turns (e.g., (6, 9) -> (7, 9) -> (8, 8) -> (8, 7)). Distance 3 (Manhattan).\n    *   (6, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (8, 7). Distance 2. (This is the most direct path without hitting the edge).\n    *   (7, 8) -> (7, 7) or (8, 8). Distance 1 move away. (7, 8) -> (8, 8) -> (8, 7) or (7, 8) -> (7, 7) -> (8, 7). Both take 2 turns depending on path.\n\n**Avoiding Enemy Collision:**\nEnemy 0 is at (3, 3). It is moving roughly towards the center/bottom, far away from my current location (6, 8). There is zero collision risk this turn.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving RIGHT to (7, 8) sets up the attack on (8, 7) or (7, 6) well.\nMoving DOWN to (6, 7) also sets up the attack on (8, 7) or (6, 6) well, and directly reduces the distance to all nearby apples.\n\nLet's look at the options from (7, 8) vs (6, 7) next turn:\n*   If we move **RIGHT to (7, 8)**:\n    *   Next turn: We can move DOWN to (7, 7) towards (8, 7) or (7, 6). Or RIGHT to (8, 8).\n*   If we move **DOWN to (6, 7)**:\n    *   Next turn: We can move RIGHT to (7, 7) towards (8, 7) or (7, 6). Or DOWN to (6, 6) (eat apple).\n\nMoving DOWN to (6, 7) leads directly to the apple at (6, 6) in one move, providing an immediate potential payoff.\n(6, 8) -> DOWN -> (6, 7).\nNext turn (T6): From (6, 7), moving DOWN leads to eating (6, 6).\nThis guarantees a point if safe.\n\nLet's check the RIGHT move again.\n(6, 8) -> RIGHT -> (7, 8).\nNext turn (T6): From (7, 8), moving DOWN leads to (7, 7). This still requires two more moves after that to reach (8, 7) or one move to reach (7, 6).\n\nSince both (6, 6) and (8, 7) are desirable, prioritizing (6, 6) offers the quickest guarantee of growth and scoring.\n\nTherefore, DOWN to (6, 7) is the best move this turn.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note for Turn 6:**\nThe move is DOWN to (6, 7). Next turn, the priority is moving DOWN to (6, 6) to eat the apple, assuming it remains. This will increase our length and score, catching up to Enemy 0. After eating (6, 6), we should look to consume (7, 6) or (8, 7).\n\nDOWN",

Moving into it is immediately fatal. **FATAL.**\n2.  **DOWN (6, 5):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Pros: Keeps central options open.

Yes.\n    *   Pros: Moves one step towards apple at (8, 7). This sets up a move to (8, 7) (RIGHT) on Turn 9.

(7, 4) (2 moves: DOWN, then something else)\n\nIf we move UP to (7, 7), we are perfectly positioned for a RIGHT move next turn to eat (8, 7). This seems like the most direct and least risky approach.\n\nIf we move RIGHT to (8, 6), we are also perfectly positioned for an UP move next turn to eat (8, 7). This also opens up the area around (9, 5) and (8, 9).\n\nLet's check the board density.\nMoving UP to (7, 7) keeps us closer to the central mass of the snake body and potentially keeps the opening in front of it clear for future maneuvers, although it's not a major factor yet.\nMoving RIGHT to (8, 6) opens up more of the edge region (x=8, x=9).

(Total 15 apples remaining).\n\n**Strategic Goal:**\nThe immediate goal is to eat the apple at (8, 7), which is now only 1 space away. We must execute this safely and quickly to close the score gap.\n\n**Location of Interest:**\n*   Your Head (H): (7, 7)\n*   Nearest Apple 1: (8, 7) - Target for this turn.\n*   Nearest Apple 2: (7, 4) - 3 moves away (if going DOWN).\n*   Nearest Apple 3: (9, 5) - 3 moves away (RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN theoretically).\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves from (7, 7):**\n\n1.  **UP (7, 8):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Pros: Moves towards (8, 9) and (2, 8).\n    *   Cons: Moves away from the immediate target (8, 7). Not ideal.\n2.  **DOWN (7, 6):**\n    *   **DANGER:** (7, 6) is the first segment of your body (the former head location). Moving into it is immediately fatal (moving backwards). **FATAL.**\n3.  **LEFT (6, 7):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Pros: Moves towards the center and provides an alternative route.\n    *   Cons: Moves away from (8, 7). This cell (6, 7) is adjacent to the body segment (6, 6) and (6, 8). This location is part of a potential trap near the snake's body, but is currently open.\n4.  **RIGHT (8, 7):**\n    *   Safe? Yes.\n    *   Collision Check: Enemy Head is at (3, 7). The enemy cannot reach (8, 7) in one turn.\n    *   Pros: EATS the apple at (8, 7). This is the best move. Increases score to 5, tying Snake 0.\n\n**Collision Analysis (Turn T=9 simultaneous move):**\n*   Your Head moves from (7, 7) to (8, 7).\n*   Enemy Head is at (3, 7).\n    *   If Enemy moves UP: (3, 8).

Safe.\n*   No risk of head-on collision or moving into the enemy's projected path.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving RIGHT to (8, 7) eats the apple, ties the score, and extends the snake's reach efficiently. It is a necessary and safe move.\n\n**Post-Move Strategy (for Turn 10):**\nAfter eating the apple (8, 7), the snake head will be at (8, 7) and the new body will be: [(7, 7), (7, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8)].\n\n*   Next nearest apples are (8, 9) [2 moves: UP, UP] or (9, 5) [multiple moves].\n*   We should aim for (8, 9) next, moving UP.\n\nRIGHT",

No overlap or head-on risk with any of my safe moves.\n- Continuing UP aligns with previous plan: directly towards (3,9) apple (eat next turn via (3,8) -> (3,9)). Keeps x=3 uncluttered for vertical freedom post-eat and multiple pivot options (LEFT to (2,8)/(1,8), RIGHT to (5,4)/(7,4)). Avoids potentially crowding x=4 closer to enemy paths. Delays growth but sets up safer, higher-apple routes than LEFT/RIGHT, which offer fewer follow-ups now (e.g., LEFT risks x=2 edges, RIGHT brings mid-threatening height).\n\n### Short-term Plan for Next Turns\nEat (3,9) via UP next turn (this move). Post-growth: surveil enemy position/head. If enemy avoids mid-right (e.g., stays up-left after possible (8,7) eat), descend RIGHT via (4,8)/(5,8)/(5,7)/(5,6)/(5,5)/(5,4) to chain (5,4)/(7,4)/(5,2)/(8,2); high freedom, 4-5 safe pivots vs. 2-3 traps. If enemy congests x=4-7 (e.g., via (7,8)/(8,8)), pivot LEFT down for (2,8)/(2,3)/(2,2); evade edges by staying y=5+ if possible. Target 7-9 apples by turn 15, monitor for growth collisions (their tail/move after eating)/score gap.\n\nUP",

Its body extends vertically: [(3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3)].\n*   Enemy potential moves: UP (3, 9, apple!), DOWN (3, 7, safe), LEFT (2, 8, apple!), RIGHT (4, 8, safe).\n*   If the enemy moves UP to (3, 9), it will eat an apple and take the lead (score 6).\n*   If the enemy moves LEFT to (2, 8), it will eat an apple and take the lead (score 6).\n*   Our positions are currently very far apart. We don't need to worry about mutual collision this turn.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe move UP to (8, 8) is the safest and most efficient path to reach the apple at (8, 9) next turn. We must secure our own score now, as the enemy is highly likely to score this turn (by moving to 3, 9 or 2, 8).\n\n**Projected Next Turn (T=11):**\n*   Your Head will be at (8, 8).\n*   You will move UP to (8, 9) to eat the apple.\n\nWe choose UP.\n\n**Long-term Plan (T=11 onwards):**\n1.

(Snake 0 ate the apple at (3, 9) last turn, assuming based on board state which shows 'T' at (3,9) if it grew, but the board shows '0' at (3,9) and its score is 6, meaning it ate an apple and moved there. Let's confirm the board state interpretation.)\n    *   Board state shows:\n        *   (3, 9) is '0' (Enemy head).\n        *   (2, 8) is 'A'.\n        *   (8, 9) is 'A'.\n    *   Enemy Body (B0): [(3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3)]. (The previous coordinates were 3,9, (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3) which means the current body list is correct for a length 7 snake, and the head is (3, 9), confirming it ate an apple last turn.)\n    *   Apples Collected: 6. (Enemy leads 6 to 5).\n*   **Apples (A):** (4, 0), (0, 5), (2, 3), (8, 2), (5, 2), (9, 5), (7, 4), (1, 4), (2, 8), (2, 2), (8, 9), (1, 8), (5, 4), (2, 0), (1, 9). (15 apples remaining).\n\n**Strategic Goal:**\nThe enemy is currently ahead 6-5. We must eat the apple at (8, 9) this turn to tie the score and maintain pressure.\n\n**Location of Interest:**\n*   Your Head (H): (8, 8)\n*   Nearest Apple: (8, 9) - 1 move away (UP).\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves from (8, 8):**\n\n1.  **UP (8, 9):**\n    *   Target Cell: (8, 9). This is an Apple (A).\n    *   Collision Check: Safe. Not out of bounds [10], not snake body. No enemy snake head nearby.\n    *   Pros: Eat apple, tie score 6-6, grow snake. Excellent move.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 7):**\n    *   Target Cell: (8, 7).\n    *   Collision Check: (8, 7) is the first segment of your body. **FATAL.**\n3.  **LEFT (7, 8):**\n    *   Target Cell: (7, 8).\n    *   Collision Check: Safe.\n    *   Pros: Keeps options open.\n    *   Cons: Moves away from immediate apple target (8, 9).\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 8):**\n    *   Target Cell: (9, 8).\n    *   Collision Check: Safe.\n    *   Pros: Keeps options open towards apple (9, 5).\n    *   Cons: Moves away from immediate apple target (8, 9).\n\n**Decision:**\nThe move UP to (8, 9) is the only highly beneficial move, as it secures an apple and ties the match. All other safe moves waste a turn relative to the immediate scoring opportunity. Moving DOWN is lethal.\n\n**Enemy Analysis (H0: 3, 9):**\nThe enemy is now at (3, 9) and leads 6-5.\n*   Enemy potential moves: DOWN (3, 8, safe, into own body), LEFT (2, 9, apple!), RIGHT (4, 9, safe).\n*   If the enemy moves DOWN to (3, 8), it moves into its own body segment (3, 8, which is its first body segment). **FATAL.** Wait, the body list is ordered head-to-tail: [(3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3)]. Moving to (3, 8) is moving directly backwards into its own head's previous position. This is lethal.\n*   If the enemy moves UP (3, 10), **FATAL** (out of bounds).\n*   If the enemy moves LEFT to (2, 9), it is safe (no apple there, but could lead to (1, 9) or (2, 8) next).\n*   If the enemy moves RIGHT to (4, 9), it is safe.\nThe most logical moves for the enemy are LEFT (aiming for (1, 9) or (2, 8)) or RIGHT (spreading out). Since (1, 9) and (2, 8) are nearby apples, the enemy might prioritize those. Since the cell (2, 9) is empty, they are likely to head LEFT.\n\nWe do not anticipate any collision risk this turn. Our primary focus is eating the apple at (8, 9).\n\n**Long-term Plan (T=12 onwards):**\n1.  (T=11) Move UP to (8, 9) to eat apple (Score 6).\n2.  (T=12) After eating (8, 9), the head is at (8, 9). Next targets are likely (9, 5) or (8, 2) or (7, 4). We should move RIGHT to (9, 9) towards (9, 5), or DOWN towards (8, 2). Moving RIGHT to (9, 9) seems safe and strategically positions us for (9, 5).\n\nUP",

Next turn: DOWN to (2,8) to eat apple (7 apples), surveil enemy; if enemy heads left (e.g., to (7,8) or (9,8)), shift RIGHT from here to (3,8) then backtrack/down; if enemy stays right, continue downward to (2,7) chain to (2,3)/(2,0 oficiais) for 1-2 more.

Out of Bounds (Y=10). **FATAL.**\n2.  **DOWN (8, 8):**\n    *   Target Cell: (8, 8).

Safe.\n    *   Pros: Keeps us safe. Allows potential path to (7, 4) or diagonal movement towards center.\n    *   Cons: Not directly towards the geographically closest apples (9, 5) or (8, 2).\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 9):**\n    *   Target Cell: (9, 9). Empty. Safe.\n    *   Pros: Positions us directly to move DOWN towards (9, 5) or (8, 2). Maintains control of the right edge.\n\n**Collision Check (Head-on):**\n*   Our potential moves: (7, 9), (9, 9).\n*   Enemy Head: (2, 9).\n*   Enemy potential moves:\n    *   UP (2, 10): Fatal (OOB).\n    *   DOWN (2, 8): Apple (A)! Highly likely move.\n    *   LEFT (1, 9): Apple (A)! Highly likely move.\n    *   RIGHT (3, 9): Into its own body. **FATAL.** (Moving directly backward).\n\nThe enemy is entirely bottlenecked by its own long body (at (3, 9), (3, 8)...). Its only safe and advantageous moves are DOWN to (2, 8) or LEFT to (1, 9), both apples. Since (2, 8) is usually easier on pathing, it might choose DOWN.\n\nThere is absolutely no risk of collision this turn, as the heads are far apart (8, 9 vs 2, 9).\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving RIGHT to (9, 9) is the cleanest move to position ourselves for the apples on the right side of the board ((9, 5) is 5 steps away, (8, 2) is 7 steps away via (8, 9)-(9, 9)-(9, 8)-(9, 7)...). It also avoids moving into the corner near where our existing body is spread out (7, 7), (7, 6).\n\n**Route Planning:**\nH: (8, 9)\nT=12: RIGHT -> (9, 9).\nT=13: DOWN -> (9, 8).\nT=14: DOWN -> (9, 7).\n... -> (9, 5) [Apple].\n\n**Long-term Plan (T=13 onwards):**\nWe are now at (9, 9).

LEFT (-1, 8): Out of Bounds. **FATAL.**\n4.  RIGHT (1, 8): Into its own body. **FATAL.** (Segment (1, 8) is body index 3, (0, 9) was body index 1, (0, 8) is head). Wait, analyze the enemy body carefully: Body is [(0, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 7), (3, 6)]. Moving to (1, 8) is into its body. **FATAL.**\n\nThe enemy's only truly safe and non-suicidal move is DOWN to (0, 7). There is zero risk of collision with our snake.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving DOWN to (9, 4) to collect the apple.\n\n**Long-term Plan (T=18 onwards):**\nAfter reaching (9, 4) and eating the apple, we will be at (9, 4). We should then look for other nearby apples.\nPotential targets:\n1. (8, 2) - Two steps away (e.g., L, D)\n2. (7, 1) - Three steps away (e.g., L, D, D or L, L, D)\n\nWe will likely move LEFT from (9, 4) to (8, 4) next, and then assess (8, 3) or (8, 2).\n\nDOWN",

Note: The tail (8, 7) will move to (9, 5) if we don't eat an apple, or stay at (8, 7) if we eat an apple (which we did last turn, so it stays). Wait, coordinates are provided head-to-tail *after* the move. Since we ate an apple at (9, 4), the body (9, 5) is now index 1, and the tail (8, 7) remains. The provided body list is the current body *excluding* the head.\n    *   Apples Collected: 8.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):** Head (H0): (0, 7).

Tail is now (3, 7) since (3, 6) was the previous tail and it moved to (3, 7).\n    *   Apples Collected: 9.\n*   **Apples (A):** (4, 0), (0, 5), (2, 3), (8, 2), (5, 2), (7, 4), (1, 4), (2, 2), (5, 4), (2, 0), (4, 4), (6, 9), (7, 1), (5, 5), (4, 6). (The apple at (9, 4) was just consumed).\n\n**Strategic Goal:**\nWe are now trailing the enemy by 1 apple (9 vs 8). We are on the far right edge of the board at (9, 4). We need to move toward accessible apples while maintaining safety and maximizing future movement options.\n\n**Nearby Apples from (9, 4):**\n1.  (8, 2) - 3 steps (L, D, D or L, D, L depending on path)\n2.  (7, 4) - 2 steps (L, L)\n3.  (7, 1) - 4 steps\n4.  (6, 9) - Far away (5 steps + direction change)\n\nThe apples (7, 4) and (8, 2) are the most immediate targets.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves from (9, 4):**\nCurrent Head: (9, 4). Segment behind head: (9, 5).\n\n1.  **UP (9, 5):**\n    *   Target Cell: (9, 5). Your body segment. **FATAL.** (Moving backwards).\n2.  **DOWN (9, 3):**\n    *   Target Cell: (9, 3). Empty. Safe. Good for moving generally towards the bottom area, but moves away from (7, 4) and doesn't directly target (8, 2).\n3.  **LEFT (8, 4):**\n    *   Target Cell: (8, 4). Empty. **Excellent.** Leads directly towards (7, 4) (1 step away) and positions the snake well for (8, 2).\n4.  **RIGHT (10, 4):**\n    *   Target Cell: (10, 4). Out of Bounds (X=10). **FATAL.**\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining:** DOWN (9, 3), LEFT (8, 4).\n\n**Choice Rationale:**\nMoving LEFT to (8, 4) is superior because it directly advances towards two desirable apple clusters:\n*   (7, 4) is one step further left.\n*   (8, 2) is two steps down/left.\n\nMoving DOWN to (9, 3) makes accessing (7, 4) harder and keeps us pinned against the right wall, limiting future maneuvering options.\n\n**Collision Check & Enemy Prediction:**\n*   Our Next H (Aimed): (8, 4).\n*   Enemy H0: (0, 7).\nThe enemy is extremely far away on the left side. The enemy's safe moves are:\n1.  UP (0, 8): Into its body. FATAL. (Body index 1 is (0, 8))\n2.  DOWN (0, 6): Empty. Safe.\n3.  LEFT (-1, 7): Out of Bounds. FATAL.\n4.  RIGHT (1, 7): Empty. Safe.\n\nThe enemy last moved to (0, 7). It will likely move DOWN to (0, 6) or RIGHT to (1, 7). Both keep it away from us. A collision risk is effectively zero.\n\n**Decision:**\nTo maximize apple access and open up the board, we choose LEFT.\n\n**Long-term Plan (T=19 onwards):**\nWe move to (8, 4).\n1.  If the enemy does not claim (7, 4), we should aim for (7, 4) next (LEFT).\n2.  Alternatively, we could aim for (8, 2) (DOWN, DOWN).\nThe choice between (7, 4) and (8, 2) depends on enemy movement and visibility next turn. Since (7, 4) is closer, it's the default priority. We must be conscious of our long body blocking off the right side.\n\nLEFT",

DOWN continues the planned path directly toward the apple at (0,5), reaching it on turn 20 (move to (0,6) on turn 19, then to (0,5) on turn 20). This keeps the path simple, maintains column 0 for potential upward retreat, and avoids committing to the side where my body is denser. RIGHT to (1,7) could lead toward apple at (1,4) but narrows options slightly by moving into the open column 1, where y=6-9 are empty but higher y=1 blockade is far; also, if enemy moves toward the middle-left, RIGHT might expose me more riskily.\n\nFavor DOWN for direct apple progress, multiple follow-ups (can continue down or right later), and bypassing potential dead-ends. No obvious head-on collision risks from enemy head at (9,4), but monitor in future.\n\n**Plan for next few turns:** Complete descent to (0,5) on turn 20, eat and grow to length 11. Then, assess pivot: likely move RIGHT to (1,5) or UP to flank toward nearby apples like (2,2), (1,4), or (2,3), avoiding overextension leftward; enemy on right seems static, prioritize left/middle apples for safer gains.\n\nDOWN",

Length 10.\n    *   Body: [(0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8)]. Tail (T0): (3, 8).\n    *   Score: 9 apples.\n*   **Apples (A):** (4, 0), (0, 5), (2, 3), (8, 2), (5, 2), **(7, 4)**, (1, 4), (2, 2), (5, 4), (2, 0), (4, 4), (6, 9), (7, 1), (5, 5), (4, 6).\n\n**Strategic Goal:**\nCatch up to Snake #0 (9 vs 8 apples). Our current position (8, 4) is excellent for reaching the nearby apples (7, 4) and (8, 2). (7, 4) is the closest, one step away.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves from (8, 4):**\nSegment behind head: (9, 4).\n\n1.  **UP (8, 5):**\n    *   Cell (8, 5): Empty. Safe. Good open space.\n2.  **DOWN (8, 3):**\n    *   Cell (8, 3): Empty. Safe. Moves closer to apple (8, 2).\n3.  **LEFT (7, 4):**\n    *   Cell (7, 4): **Apple!** EAT. Excellent move.\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 4):**\n    *   Cell (9, 4): Your body segment (index 1). **FATAL.** (Moving backwards).\n\n**Safe Moves Remaining:** UP (8, 5), DOWN (8, 3), LEFT (7, 4).\n\n**Choice Rationale:**\nMoving LEFT to (7, 4) immediately nets us an apple, increases our score to 9 (tying the enemy), and increases our length, making us safer. This is the highest priority move.\n\n**Enemy Prediction (H0 at (0, 6)):**\nEnemy body segment behind head: (0, 7).\nSafe enemy moves:\n1.  UP (0, 7): Into its body. FATAL. (Body index 1 is (0, 7))\n2.  DOWN (0, 5): **Apple!** (0, 5) - HIGH probability.\n3.  LEFT (-1, 6): Out of bounds. FATAL.\n4.  RIGHT (1, 6): Empty. Safe.\n\nThe enemy is entirely on the far left side, nowhere near (7, 4). There is no collision risk. The enemy will likely move DOWN to (0, 5) to eat an apple.\n\n**Decision:**\nChoose LEFT to consume the apple at (7, 4).\n\n**Long-term Plan (T=20 onwards):**\nAfter eating the apple at (7, 4), our head will be at (7, 4) and our length will be 10. We will be tied in score (9-9). The nearest apples are now:\n1. (8, 2) - 3 steps (e.g., R, D, D or D, R, D)\n2. (5, 4) - 2 steps (L, L)\n3. (4, 4) - 3 steps\n\nIf we move LEFT, we head towards the center (5, 4), (4, 4), (5, 5). If we move RIGHT or DOWN from (7, 4), we head towards (8, 2). Moving LEFT keeps us centered and offers more flexibility, utilizing the area we just opened up. We should prioritize moving towards the central cluster of apples (4, 4), (5, 4), (5, 5).\n\nLEFT",

RIGHT to (1,6) keeps options but delays the eat; moving closer to enemy area in y=6-9, where row is open but could get surrounded if enemy shifts left. Favor DOWN for immediate gain and continuing downward path.\n\nPlan for next few turns: Eat at (0,5) on turn 20, then RIGHT from (0,5) to (1,5) on turn 21, then DOWN from (1,5) to (1,4) on turn 22 to eat another, skipping (2,2) or others farther away.

Since we are not guaranteed to eat an apple, we treat the entire current body as unsafe.\nSnake 0 Body: (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9), (3, 9).\n\n**Evaluation of Moves from (7, 3):**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 4):**\n    *   Collision: (7, 4) is the segment immediately behind the head (part of Snake 1's body). This is a fatal collision (moving directly backward).\n    *   *Kills Snake 1.*\n\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 2):**\n    *   Safety: (7, 2) is empty. Safe.\n    *   Next to Apple: Moves closer to (8, 2) and (7, 1).\n    *   Enemy location: Snake 0 is far away on the left side (1, 5).\n    *   *Safe Move.*\n\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 3):**\n    *   Safety: (6, 3) is empty. Safe.\n    *   Next to Apple: No immediate apple.\n    *   *Safe Move.*\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 3):**\n    *   Safety: (8, 3) is empty. Safe.\n    *   Next to Apple: Moves towards (8, 2) in the next turn (either DOWN or possibly RIGHT/DOWN).\n    *   *Safe Move.*\n\n**Comparing Safe Moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT):**\n\nWe are trying to reach the nearby apples: (8, 2) and (7, 1).\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (7, 2):**\n    *   If we go DOWN, we are 1 move away from (7, 1) [DOWN again] and potentially 1 move away from (8, 2) [RIGHT].\n    *   If we move DOWN, the apple (8, 2) is still reachable via a right turn in the next move.\n    *   This is a strong axial move towards the bottom right quadrant where apples are abundant.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (8, 3):**\n    *   If we go RIGHT, we are 1 move away from (8, 2) [DOWN].\n    *   This targets (8, 2) very directly.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (6, 3):**\n    *   Moves away from the immediate apples (8, 2), (7, 1). Less desirable unless we prioritize getting space.\n\n**Decision between DOWN (7, 2) and RIGHT (8, 3):**\n\nBoth lead to the apple (8, 2) in 1 subsequent move (assuming no collision).\n\n1.  If I choose **RIGHT (8, 3)**: Next turn options include DOWN to (8, 2) (Apple).\n2.  If I choose **DOWN (7, 2)**: Next turn options include RIGHT to (8, 2) (Apple) OR DOWN to (7, 1) (Apple).\n\nChoosing DOWN (7, 2) seems slightly better as it opens up two apple options (7, 1) and (8, 2) for the next turn, offering flexibility if one path becomes blocked by the enemy tail (unlikely given the distance) or if we need to adjust course.\n\nLet's confirm the coordinates:\n(7, 3) -> DOWN -> (7, 2)\nFrom (7, 2):\n*   RIGHT -> (8, 2) (Apple)\n*   DOWN -> (7, 1) (Apple)\n\nIf I choose RIGHT (8, 3):\nFrom (8, 3):\n*   DOWN -> (8, 2) (Apple)\n\nBoth are good, but DOWN maximizes follow-up apple options. Let's stick with DOWN.\n\n**Enemy Head Prediction (Snake 0 at (1, 5)):**\nSnake 0 is likely trying to move towards (1, 4) (Apple) or (2, 6) (Apple) or (2, 3) (Apple).\nPossible moves for Snake 0:\n*   UP to (1, 6) (Empty, closer to (2, 6))\n*   DOWN to (1, 4) (Apple!) - Highly likely.\n*   RIGHT to (2, 5) (Empty)\n*   LEFT to (0, 5) (Into body segment (0, 5), impossible)\n\nIf Snake 0 moves DOWN to (1, 4), it gets the apple and grows. This doesn't affect my immediate move in the bottom right corner.\n\nFinal decision: Move DOWN to maintain multiple apple options for Turn 22.\n\nDOWN\n**START LAST RATIONALE**\nTurn 21 / 150\n\n**Strategy:** My immediate goal is to collect apples efficiently as I am slightly behind in score (9 vs 10). I am currently at (7, 3).\n\n**Analysis of Safe Moves:**\n1.  UP to (7, 4): Self-collision (moving backwards). **FATAL.**\n2.  DOWN to (7, 2): Safe. Opens up two apples for the next turn: (8, 2) via RIGHT, or (7, 1) via DOWN.\n3.  LEFT to (6, 3): Safe, but moves away from immediate apple clusters.\n4.  RIGHT to (8, 3): Safe. Opens up apple (8, 2) via DOWN next turn.\n\n**Decision:** Moving DOWN to (7, 2) is preferred because it places my snake in a position to choose between two different nearby apples ((8, 2) and (7, 1)) on Turn 22, maximizing immediate flexibility and apple access compared to moving RIGHT, which is focused solely on (8, 2). The enemy snake is far away and does not pose an immediate threat to the selected path.\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\nDOWN",

Length 11 (Apples 10).\n    *   Body: [(7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9)] (T).\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head (H): (2, 4). Length 12 (Apples 11).\n    *   Body: [(1, 4), (1, 5), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (0, 8), (0, 9), (1, 9), (1, 8), (2, 8), (2, 9)].\n*   **Apples:** (4, 0), (2, 3), (8, 2), (5, 2), (2, 2), (5, 4), (2, 0), (4, 4), (6, 9), (5, 5), (4, 6), (2, 6), (4, 8), (5, 1), (3, 2).\n\n**Current Position and Goal:**\nWe just ate an apple at (7, 1). We are slightly behind in score (10 vs 11). We need to secure another apple quickly.\n\n**Relevant Board State around (7, 1):**\n*   (7, 2) is the segment directly behind the head.\n*   (8, 2) is an apple.\n*   (5, 1) is an apple.\n*   (4, 0) is an apple.\n\n**Evaluating Safe Moves from (7, 1):**\n\n1.  **UP to (7, 2):**\n    *   Collision: (7, 2) is the segment immediately behind the head. This is a fatal collision (moving directly backward).\n    *   *Kills Snake 1.*\n\n2.  **DOWN to (7, 0):**\n    *   Safety: (7, 0) is empty space. No immediate collision.\n    *   Future: Leads towards the bottom edge, away from immediate apples, but it is a safe move.\n\n3.  **LEFT to (6, 1):**\n    *   Safety: (6, 1) is empty space.\n    *   Future: Opens up options towards apples at (5, 1) or perhaps swinging down towards (4, 0).\n\n4.  **RIGHT to (8, 1):**\n    *   Safety: (8, 1) is empty space.\n    *   Future: This position leads towards the very attractive apple at (8, 2) and opens up the right side of the board.\n\n**Analyzing Apple Targets:**\n\n*   **Apple (8, 2):** 2 moves away via (8, 1) or 2 moves away via (7, 0) then (8, 0) then (8, 1) (no, 7,0 then 8,0 is 2 moves, 8,2 is 3 moves).\n    *   Route RIGHT to (8, 1). Next turn, move UP to (8, 2) and eat. This seems like the most direct route to the closest significant apple reward.\n\n*   **Apple (5, 1):** 2 moves away via (6, 1). Next turn, move LEFT to (5, 1) and eat.\n\n*   **Apple (3, 2):** 4 moves away.\n\n*   **Apple (8, 2) vs (5, 1):**\n    *   Both are 2 moves away.\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (8, 1) seems strategically better as it takes us away from the dense enemy body mass (Snake 0 is far left, but our long tail occupies the right edge).\n\n**Checking for Enemy Conflict (Snake 0 at (2, 4)):**\nSnake 0 is far away and unlikely to interfere with either the (8, 2) or (5, 1) targets in the next 2 turns.\n\n**Move Choice: RIGHT to (8, 1)**\nThis takes us to a safe spot, (8, 1), setting up a guaranteed apple acquisition at (8, 2) next turn via an UP move.\n\n**Detailed Check of RIGHT move consequences:**\n*   Move to (8, 1). Safe.\n*   Next turn: Move UP to (8, 2) (Apple). Safe, as long as no unexpected head-on collision occurs.\n    *   Could Snake 0 be heading towards (8, 2)? To reach (8, 2) in two turns, Snake 0 would need to move something like (3, 4) -> (4, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (6, 4) -> (7, 4) -> (8, 4) ... too far. It's safe.\n\n**Long-Term Plan for next few turns:**\n1.  **Turn 23:** Move RIGHT to (8, 1).\n2.  **Turn 24:** Move UP to (8, 2) (Eat apple).\n3.  From (8, 2), look at apples further up (e.",

Advances last plan to eat (2,3), enabling potential chain to (2,2) afterward or sideways to (5,2)/(4,4) cluster. Keeps 3-4 safe follow-ups (up to (2,4) or circling back indirectly, right to (3,3), left if clear after growth) and avoids enemy spine (column 7/8/9). No immediate head-on risk from enemy at (7,1), who must traverse multiple cells to reach near column 2 low.\n- LEFT: Into (1,4), own body, die.\n- RIGHT: Into (3,4), empty space, safe. Moves toward (4,4) apple next turn, with access to (3,2) if pivoting down left, good for loops back to (4,4)-(5,4)-(5,5). 3-4 safe follow-ups but slightly narrows early (only up/down/left safe immediately; right risky near potential growth). Less aligns with vertical apple pursuit than DOWN and may force earlier enemy engagement on map's right side.\n\nFavor DOWN: Directly eats guaranteed apple per last rationale's plan, accelerates lead (enemy at 10 apples), maximizes column 2's 4 apple stack with expansion options (e.g., up to (2,6) apple shortly at 11 length or pivot to row0/3 apples leftward), avoids dead-ends when enemy shifts (predicting they eat right-side (5,1)/(8,2) and stay column7 focus). RIGHT is solid but DOWN captures immediate value better; avoid UP/LEFT death moves entirely.\n\nUpdated plan: Eat (2,3) now, then prioritize column 2 upward (2,2 then 2,6) for quick 2-3 more apples, watching enemy expansion left (e.g., if near (4,4)/(5,4), contour around via row 1-3 left to stall them). If enemy encircles right/board edge, retreat column 2 down to (2,0). Keep 2-3 safe options per turn; aim for 18-20 apples threshold before mid-game risks.\n\nDOWN",
