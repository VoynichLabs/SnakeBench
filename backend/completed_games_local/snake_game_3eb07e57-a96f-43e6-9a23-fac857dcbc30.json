A major competitive version of this type of game is *Battlesnake*, which is a game where your snake is controlled by a live web server responding to an API, and the goal is to survive as long as possible by navigating a board, finding food, and avoiding collisions [docs.battlesnake.com](https://docs.battlesnake.com/).\n\nThis is Turn 0, the first move. My snake has 0 segments currently, effectively just a head at (2, 8).\n\n**Board State Summary:**\n*   My Head (0): (2, 8)\n*   Enemy Head (1): (6, 7)\n*   Apples: (8, 2), (6, 6), (3, 9), (2, 7), (1, 6)\n\n**Goal:** Safely eat apples and avoid collisions.\n\n**1. Analyze Potential Moves for My Snake (ID 0) from (2, 8):**\n\n*   **UP (to 2, 9):**\n    *   (2, 9) is on the board.\n    *   Cell (2, 9) contains 'A' (an apple).\n    *   Safe move: Yes. (This is a priority move: immediate apple.)\n\n*   **DOWN (to 2, 7):**\n    *   (2, 7) is on the board.\n    *   Cell (2, 7) contains 'A' (an apple).\n    *   Safe move: Yes. (This is also a priority move: immediate apple.)\n\n*   **LEFT (to 1, 8):**\n    *   (1, 8) is on the board.\n    *   Cell (1, 8) is empty ('.').\n    *   Safe move: Yes.\n\n*   **RIGHT (to 3, 8):**\n    *   (3, 8) is on the board.\n    *   Cell (3, 8) is empty ('.').\n    *   Safe move: Yes.\n\nAll four moves are immediately safe as I have no body to hit, and the bounds are 0-9.\n\n**2. Analyze Opponent Snake (ID 1) Movement from (6, 7):**\n\nThe enemy's move is unknown, but I must assess if they could cause an immediate collision if I choose a specific direction.\n\n*   Enemy Head: (6, 7)\n*   Potential Enemy targets: (6, 8), (6, 6), (5, 7), (7, 7).\n\n*Collision Check:*\nMy snake is at (2, 8). The closest potential intersection is far away, so there is no risk of a head-on collision this turn, regardless of their move.\n\n**3. Decision Strategy (Prioritize Apples):**\n\nBoth UP (to 2, 9) and DOWN (to 2, 7) result in immediately getting an apple this turn. I must choose which one sets me up better for the long term.\n\n*   **UP to (2, 9):**\n    *   Eats apple (3, 9). *Wait, no. The apple is at (3, 9), not (2, 9). Let me re-check the board coordinates.*\n    *   Apples at: (8, 2), (6, 6), **(3, 9)**, **(2, 7)**, **(1, 6)**.\n    *   The apple *visually* above me is at (3, 9). If I move UP to (2, 9), the cell is empty ('.').\n    *   The apple *visually* below me is at (2, 7). If I move DOWN to (2, 7), the cell contains an apple.\n\n*Re-evaluating moves based on correct Apple Coordinates:*\n\n*   **UP (to 2, 9):** Cell (2, 9) is empty. (Score: 0, Position: good for visibility but not immediate apple.)\n*   **DOWN (to 2, 7):** Cell (2, 7) contains an apple. (Score: +1 apple, Position slightly lower.)\n*   **LEFT (to 1, 8):** Cell (1, 8) is empty. (No progress towards the closest apple at (1, 6) or (2, 7).)\n*   **RIGHT (to 3, 8):** Cell (3, 8) is empty. (Closer to (3, 9) apple, but not immediate.)\n\nThe move DOWN to (2, 7) is the only move that guarantees an apple this turn.\n\n**4. Long-Term Outlook after DOWN:**\n*   After moving DOWN, my position is (2, 7). My new body segment is at (2, 8).\n*   The nearby apples remaining are (3, 9) and (1, 6).\n*   From (2, 7), I can move LEFT to (1, 7) and then DOWN to (1, 6) for the next apple, or move RIGHT to (3, 7) and then UP to (3, 8) and (3, 9) for the apple there.\n*   This move takes a safe, guaranteed point and preserves options.\n\n**The clear choice is DOWN.**\n\nDOWN",

The enemy snake #0 is at (2,8).\n\n**Safe Move Analysis:**\n- UP to (6,8): Empty cell, safe\n- DOWN to (6,6): Contains an apple - would eat it and grow, safe\n- LEFT to (5,7): Empty cell, safe  \n- RIGHT to (7,7): Empty cell, safe\n\nAll four moves appear safe on the surface. DOWN is particularly attractive because it would immediately collect an apple at (6,6), giving me my first point and starting to grow. Since I have no body yet, I don't need to worry about colliding with myself.\n\n**Enemy Consideration:**\nThe enemy snake at (2,8) is far away and poses no immediate threat. It would need 4-5 moves to reach my area.\n\n**Strategic Planning:**\nMy immediate goal should be to start collecting apples while maintaining mobility. The apple at (6,6) is directly below me, making it the most accessible. After eating it, I'll need to be careful about my increased length but will have more health buffer.\n\n**Next Turn Considerations:**\nAfter moving DOWN and eating the apple, I'll have a body segment at (6,7). I'll need to avoid moving back into that position on the next turn. The surrounding area has plenty of open space to maneuver.\n\nDOWN",

Its body is now 2 segments long.\n\nThe game is a multi-apple competitive programming game that shares core mechanics with **Battlesnake**, where the goal is survival and strategic movement to consume food and eliminate opponents [docs.battlesnake.com/rules]. Key rules include simultaneous move resolution, health management (though simplified here to just growth via apples), and various types of collisions, most notably self-collision, body collision, and head-to-head collision [docs.battlesnake.com/rules].\n\n**Current State Update (Turn 1):**\n\n*   **Board Dimensions:** 10x10 (0-9, 0-9)\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):**\n    *   Head: (2, 7)\n    *   Body: [(2, 8)]\n    *   Length: 2 segments.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):** Moved to an unknown location from (6, 7).

I will trust the coordinate list: Head (0) is at (2, 7), Body (T) is at (2, 8).)*\n\n### 1. Analyze Potential Moves for My Snake (ID 0) from (2, 7):\n\nI need to move toward an apple while avoiding my own body and the boundaries.\n\n*   **Own Body Hazard:** (2, 8) (The segment immediately behind the head, directly UP).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Safety Check | Content | Outcome/Goal |\n| :--- | :------------ | :----------- | :------ | :----------- |\n| **UP** | (2, 8) | **FATAL** | My Body (T) | Self-collision (moving directly backward is illegal). |\n| **DOWN** | (2, 6) | Safe | Empty ('.') | Moves toward (1, 6) and (2, 2). |\n| **LEFT** | (1, 7) | Safe | Empty ('.') | Moves toward (1, 6). |\n| **RIGHT**| (3, 7) | Safe | Empty (T) | Moves toward (3, 9). |\n\nAll of **DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT** are safe moves.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Safe Moves based on Apples:\n\nThe closest apples are:\n1. (3, 9) - 1 move Right, 2 moves Up = Manhattan distance 3\n2. (1, 6) - 1 move Left, 1 move Down = Manhattan distance 2 (Closest!)\n3. (2, 2) - 5 moves Down = Manhattan distance 5\n\n**A. LEFT (to 1, 7):**\n*   Manhattan distance to (1, 6): 1\n*   This is the fastest path toward the closest apple.\n*   Keep me on the left side of the board, away from the enemy.\n\n**B. DOWN (to 2, 6):**\n*   Manhattan distance to (1, 6): 2 (Need to follow up with LEFT or DOWN, then LEFT)\n*   Manhattan distance to (2, 2): 4\n*   This also moves me away from the enemy and keeps me centered.\n\n**C. RIGHT (to 3, 7):**\n*   Manhattan distance to (3, 9): 2 (Need to follow up with UP, then UP)\n*   This directs me toward the top-right and the (3, 9) apple.\n\n**Decision:** The apple at (1, 6) is the most immediate target (MD=2). Moving **LEFT** to (1, 7) puts me one step closer to it, and also avoids the immediate region of Snake #1 (currently at (6, 6)).\n\n### 3. Collision Check (Head-to-Head):\n\n*   My intended move: (2, 7) -> (1, 7) [LEFT]\n*   Enemy Head: (6, 6).\n*   The distance is large (Manhattan distance 5), so no head-on collision is possible this turn.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan:\n\nThe plan is to move **LEFT** to secure the apple at (1, 6) next turn, thereby increasing length and maintaining high health (which is implicitly full after eating an apple).\n\n*   **Turn 1:** Move LEFT to (1, 7).\n*   **Turn 2:** Move DOWN to (1, 6) to eat the apple.\n\nThis avoids the enemy, gains an apple quickly, and keeps future options open.\n\nLEFT",

Identify Potential Moves for My Snake (ID 0) from (1, 7):\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Safety Check | Content | Outcome/Goal |\n| :--- | :------------ | :----------- | :------ | :----------- |\n| **UP** | (1, 8) | Safe | Empty | Moves away from immediate food. |\n| **DOWN** | (1, 6) | Safe | Apple (A) | **Eats Apple!** (High Priority) |\n| **LEFT** | (0, 7) | Safe | Empty | Moves to boundary corner. |\n| **RIGHT**| (2, 7) | **FATAL** | My Body (T) | Self-collision (moving directly backward). |\n\nMoves **UP, DOWN, and LEFT** are safe. Moving **DOWN** lands directly on an apple, which should be the highest priority.\n\n### 2. Predict Enemy Movement (Snake #1 from 5, 6):\n\nEnemy A* pathfinding (or similar algorithm) would likely target the closest apples [docs.battlesnake.com/guides/useful-algorithms].\n\n1. (1, 6) - MD 4 (1 Left, 4 Down) **My target**\n2. (2, 2) - MD 7 (3 Left, 4 Down)\n3. (7, 2) - MD 6 (2 Right, 4 Down)\n\nGiven its location, Snake #1 will likely move towards (7, 2) or (2, 2) if it can't reach (1, 6) quickly.\nPossible Enemy Moves from (5, 6):\n*   UP (5, 7): Away from all apples.\n*   DOWN (5, 5): Toward the lower apples (2, 2), (7, 2).\n*   LEFT (4, 6): Also toward the lower apples.\n*   RIGHT (6, 6): Body collision (FATAL, since (6, 6) is its own body).\n\nSnake #1 must avoid its body segment at (6, 6).\n\nSafe Enemy Moves: (5, 7) [UP], (5, 5) [DOWN], (4, 6) [LEFT].\nThe enemy will likely move **DOWN (5, 5)** or **LEFT (4, 6)** to maintain pressure or find food.\n\n### 3. Collision Check:\n\n*   My intended move: **DOWN** to (1, 6) (Apple).\n*   Enemy likely moves to (5, 5) or (4, 6).\n*   No possible head-to-head collision. My move is safe.\n\n### 4. Strategy & Decision:\n\nThe move **DOWN** to (1, 6) secures an apple, increases our length to 3, and maintains our lead in apples (2 total, compared to 1 for the enemy). This is the optimal, safe, and aggressive move.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (Self Note):** After eating the apple at (1, 6), my head will be at (1, 6) and my body will be [(2, 7), (2, 7) -> new tail (1, 7)]. Wait, my body grows by one segment on the *next* turn after eating. Based on Battlesnake rules [docs.battlesnake.com/rules]: \"An additional body part is placed on top of their current tail (this will extend their visible length by one on the next turn).\" Since this simplified game might handle growth differently (growing immediately or appending to the current tail location which is then maintained), I will assume the growth means my length increases by one, and all segments, including the tail, remain.\nMy body segments will be: (1, 6) [Head], (1, 7), (2, 7). Length 3.\n\n**Next Target:** If I am at (1, 6), the next closest apple is (2, 2) (Manhattan distance 4: 1 Right, 4 Down). I should aim for (2, 2) next, or the corner (0, 7) for space if I need to avoid Snake #1. Given Snake #1's position, the lower left quadrant remains safe for now.\n\nDOWN",

It could potentially move toward the same apple at (1,6) - this creates potential for head-on collision if we both go for it. However, it's one cell further away and might choose the closer apple at (3,9).\n\n**Strategic Planning:**\nI need to continue toward the (1,6) apple while avoiding potential conflict with snake #0. Moving LEFT again gets me closer but might lead to a head-on collision if snake #0 moves DOWN. DOWN or UP could be safer alternatives to approach from a different angle while keeping options open.\n\nThe apple at (1,6) is valuable, but I should approach cautiously. Moving DOWN to (5,5) gives me flexibility - I can then go LEFT toward the apple while having UP as an escape route if snake #0 goes for the same target.\n\n**Short-term plan:** Approach the northwest apple cluster cautiously, watch snake #0's movements, and maintain escape routes. Consider circling around through the bottom if snake #0 blocks direct access to (1,6).\n\nDOWN",

Identify Target Apples and Distances:\nMy Head: (1, 6)\n\n| Apple | Coordinates | Manhattan Distance (MD) | Direction | Priority |\n| :---- | :---------- | :---------------------- | :-------- | :------- |\n| A1 | (2, 2) | MD 5 (1 Right, 4 Down) | Southeast | High (Closest) |\n| A2 | (5, 2) | MD 8 (4 Right, 4 Down) | Southeast | Medium |\n| A3 | (7, 2) | MD 10 (6 Right, 4 Down) | Southeast | Medium |\n| A4 | (8, 2) | MD 11 (7 Right, 4 Down) | Southeast | Medium |\n| A5 | (3, 9) | MD 5 (2 Right, 3 Up) | Northeast | High (Tied for Closest) |\n\nApples (2, 2) and (3, 9) are equally close in MD (5). Given my position at (1, 6), moving towards (2, 2) keeps me in the lower half of the board, away from the enemy's likely path, as Snake #1 is at (5, 5).\n\n### 2. Identify Potential Moves for My Snake (ID 0) from (1, 6):\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Safety Check | Content | Outcome/Goal |\n| :--- | :------------ | :----------- | :------ | :----------- |\n| **UP** | (1, 7) | **FATAL** | My Body (1, 7) | Self-collision (moving directly backward). |\n| **DOWN**| (1, 5) | Safe | Empty | Moves toward lower quadrant, maintains centralization. |\n| **LEFT** | (0, 6) | Safe | Empty | Moves to boundary. |\n| **RIGHT**| (2, 6) | Safe | Empty | Moves toward (2, 2) [Apple]. |\n\nMoves **DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT** are safe. **UP** is a self-collision (moving backward into the segment at (1, 7)).\n\n### 3. Strategy Evaluation:\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (2, 6):** This is the path toward A1 at (2, 2). It also moves horizontally away from the wall and opens up the most space. This is generally optimal as it heads toward a close apple and keeps options open.\n*   **Move DOWN to (1, 5):** This moves one step closer to A1 (2, 2) in the Y dimension, but restricts movement along the left boundary.\n*   **Move LEFT to (0, 6):** This moves to the wall, reducing available moves next turn. Avoid unless necessary.\n\n**Optimal Choice:** **RIGHT** to (2, 6).\n\n### 4. Enemy Prediction (Snake #1 from 5, 5):\nThe enemy is at (5, 5). Closest apples for Snake #1:\n1. (5, 2) - MD 3 (3 Down) **Direct line of sight and closest.**\n2. (7, 2) - MD 5 (2 Right, 3 Down)\n3. (2, 2) - MD 6 (3 Left, 3 Down)\n\nSnake #1 is *highly* likely to move **DOWN (5, 4)** towards the apple at (5, 2).\nPossible safe moves for Snake #1 from (5, 5) (assuming body at (5, 6) is the only block): UP (5, 6) [Self-collision], DOWN (5, 4), LEFT (4, 5), RIGHT (6, 5).\nIf Snake #1 moves DOWN, it heads toward (5, 2).\n\n### 5. Final Collision Check:\n*   My intended move: **RIGHT** to (2, 6).\n*   Enemy likely move: **DOWN** to (5, 4).\n*   No collision possible.\n\nThe move RIGHT is safe, smart, and puts me on the offensive path toward the apple at (2, 2).\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\nAfter moving to (2, 6), aim for (2, 5), (2, 4), (2, 3), and then (2, 2) to capture the apple. I should monitor Snake #1, which is likely targeting (5, 2). If I secure (2, 2) quickly, I maintain a strong score and length advantage.\n\nRIGHT",

Monitor snake #0's movement - if it heads toward the row 2 apples, I may need to pivot to the (7,2) or (8,2) apples on the right side. Avoid direct confrontation until I have more length.\n\nDOWN",

This is the highest probability move (MD 1).\n*   If Snake #1 moves to (5, 2), its body will shrink by one block this turn, but since it's eating an apple, it will retain its tail (its current position at (5, 4) turns into (5, 3), and its old tail (5, 4) stays, but the new tail is at (5, 4) essentially making it \\[ (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4) \\]). No, the body grows by one unit, so the tail segment (5, 4) remains, and the new body is [(5, 3), (5, 4)]. Length 3.\n\n**Prediction for Snake #1:** **DOWN** to (5, 2) to eat the apple.\n\n### 4.

This keeps me centered on my immediate goal.\n*   **Collision risk:** No risk of collision with Snake #1. They are moving far to my right and likely scoring.\n\nMy move DOWN is safe and ensures maximum progress toward scoring.\n\n### Long-Term Plan:\n1. Move DOWN to (2, 4).\n2. Move DOWN to (2, 3).\n3. Move DOWN to (2, 2) and eat the apple.\nAfter securing (2, 2), if the apple at (5, 2) is gone (as predicted), I will pivot toward the high-up apple at (3, 9) or the cluster of apples remaining on the bottom right.\n\nDOWN",

My next target should be (4, 8) or (3, 9). Given the enemy is scoring in the bottom right, I should move RIGHT then UP towards that cluster. I will be at (2, 1) next turn (if I grow, my tail is at (2, 4)).\n\nDOWN",

Snake #0 remains at (2,3) with body [(2,4), (2,5)]. Apples are at (8,2), (3,9), (2,2), (7,2), (4,8).\n\n**Safety Check for Possible Moves:**\n- UP to (6,3): Empty cell - safe\n- DOWN to (6,1): Empty cell - safe  \n- LEFT to (5,2): Contains my own body segment - DEADLY\n- RIGHT to (7,2): Contains apple - safe\n\n**Strategic Assessment:**\nRIGHT is the optimal move - it collects the apple at (7,2) and continues my momentum along row 2. This would give me 4 apples vs snake #0's 2 apples. The row 2 apples are perfectly aligned for efficient collection.\n\nSnake #0 at (2,3) could potentially move toward the apple at (2,2), but I have a clear advantage on row 2. By taking RIGHT, I secure another apple while maintaining the opportunity to collect (8,2) next.\n\n**Short-term plan for next 2-3 turns:** After eating (7,2), continue RIGHT to (8,2) to collect that apple. This would give me 5 apples total. After clearing row 2, assess whether to move upward toward (4,8) or (3,9), or potentially cut off snake #0's access to these apples. My growing length requires careful path planning to avoid self-collision.\n\n**Key consideration:** My body now extends vertically along column 5, so I need to be mindful of creating accessible paths for future movement. The row 2 strategy remains efficient and relatively safe.\n\nRIGHT",

My new body is [(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)]. My tail is still at (2, 5) if I grew, or (2, 4) if I didn't. Since my length is 4, my tail is at (2, 5). Wait, if length is 4, and body segments are 3, the total length is 4. The segments are (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5). That is 3 body segments. Head is 1. Total length is 4. When I move and grow, the tail segment (2, 5) remains and a new head segment is added.\n\nThe provided current body list is [(2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)].\nIf my snake's length is 4 (Head + 3 Body segments), and I just ate, then for this turn, the segment (2, 5) will be removed *only if* I *did not* eat this turn. Since I ate last turn, my tail remains for this move. Therefore, all segments (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5) must be avoided, as they constitute my body.\n\nSnake #1 History Check:\nSnake #1 moved from (6, 2) to (7, 2), eating the apple there. Its new body is [(6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)]. Length 5. Tail segment (5, 4) remains.\n\nTarget Apples:\nA1: (8, 2) - Near Snake 1.\nA2: (3, 9) - High up.\nA3: (4, 8) - High up.\nA4: (3, 6) - Mid board.\nA5: (4, 7) - Mid board.\n\n### 1.

Apple A4 at (3, 6) is the single closest target.\n\n### 2.

Moves DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT are safe.\n\n**Optimal Move Consideration:** Moving RIGHT to (3, 2) gets me closer to A4, A5, etc., and opens up the path to move UP later.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Enemy Moves (Snake #1 from 7, 2):\n\nSnake #1 must be trying to score the last apple in that bottom-right cluster, A1 at (8, 2).\n\nSnake #1 options from (7, 2):\n1.  **RIGHT to (8, 2):** **Eats Apple A1**. MD 1. Highly likely.\n2.  **UP to (7, 3):** Safe. Towards upper apples, but takes longer than scoring (8, 2).\n3.  **DOWN to (7, 1):** Safe. Away from apples.\n4.  **LEFT to (6, 2):** **FATAL**. Moves into its own body segment (6, 2).\n\n**Prediction for Snake #1:** **RIGHT** to (8, 2). Snake #1 is aggressively scoring and has a clear path.\n\n### 4. Head-on Collision Check:\nMy move: (2, 2) -> (3, 2).\nEnemy move: (7, 2) -> (8, 2) (Predicted).\n\nNo head-on collision risk.\n\n### 5. Strategy Evaluation and Move Selection:\nThe move **RIGHT** to (3, 2) is safe, efficient for accessing the rich apple cluster in the upper board, and keeps my path clear.\n\n**Long-Term Plan for T9 and beyond:**\n1. Move RIGHT to (3, 2). My new length is 4. My tail will be at (2, 5).\n2. T9: Move UP to (3, 3). This aligns me vertically with A4 (3, 6).\n3. T10-T12: Continue UP to eat A4.\n4. After eating A4, pivot to A5 (4, 7) or A3 (4, 8).\n\nRIGHT",

This is the definition of a backwards move collision and must be avoided.\n\nMove UP to (3, 3) is a perfect next step, moving 1 unit closer to A4 (3, 6).\n\n### 4. Evaluate Enemy Moves (Snake #1 from 8, 2):\n\nSnake #1 just ate and is now focused on reaching the high-value apple cluster in the upper board, or perhaps swinging to the right wall. The snake's immediate viable neighbors are (9, 2), (8, 3), (7, 2).\n\nSnake #1 options from (8, 2):\n1.  **RIGHT to (9, 2):** Safe. Moves along the bottom edge, potentially turning UP at (9, 2).\n2.  **UP to (8, 3):** Safe. Towards upper apples, but still far.\n3.  **DOWN to (8, 1):** Safe. Away from apples.\n4.  **LEFT to (7, 2):** **FATAL**. Moves into its own body segment.\n\n**Prediction for Snake #1:** Snake #1 now has 5 apples and is tied with me (wait, my score is 3, enemy is 5, so they are 2 ahead). They will likely prioritize moving towards the wall (RIGHT to 9, 2) or UP (to 8, 3) to approach the central apple mass. Neither move creates a head-on collision risk with my planned move (3, 3). No dangerous intersection is projected.\n\n### 5. Strategy Evaluation and Move Selection:\nThe move **UP** to (3, 3) is safe and directly addresses the closest apple, A4 (3, 6). This move positions my snake perfectly for subsequent moves towards A4, potentially scoring it in T12.\n\n**Long-Term Plan for T10 and beyond:**\n1. T9: Move UP to (3, 3).\n2. T10: Move UP to (3, 4).\n3. T11: Move UP to (3, 5).\n4. T12: Move UP to (3, 6) - **Eats Apple A4**.\n\nThis plan is contingent on Enemy #1 not moving LEFT and blocking my access from (4, 6) (which is unlikely as they are currently on the right side of the board).\n\nUP",

My goal is to maximize my apple count while ensuring survival on this 10x10 board.\n\n**Game State Analysis (Turn 10/150)**\n\n*   **Board Size:** 10x10. Coordinates (0,0) bottom-left, (9,9) top-right.\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):** Head (3, 3), Body [(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)], Length 4. Apples: 3.\n*   **Enemy Snake (ID 1):** Head (8, 3), Body [(8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3)], Length 6. Apples: 5.\n    *Note: The board state description seems to use standard graphic representation, but the coordinate system description (0,0 bottom left) is key.* The body definition `[(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)]` suggests the snake came from (2, 3) to (3, 3), or perhaps moved UP from (3, 2) to (3, 3) last turn, consuming the segment at (2, 3) if an apple was not eaten. Assuming the body list is head-to-tail and reflects the current occupied tiles *before* the next move is applied and tail is shed/retained.\n\nLet's reconstruct the movement path from the previous rationale (Turn 9 move was UP to (3, 3)).\n\n*   **T9 Start:** Head (3, 2), Body [(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4)]. Length 4.\n*   **T9 Move:** UP to (3, 3).\n*   **T10 Start (Current):**\n    *   Head (3, 3).\n    *   The second segment is the previous head (3, 2).\n    *   The tail segment (2, 4) should be shed *if* no apple was eaten.\n    *   Therefore, the list `[(3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)]` represents the segments *currently* in the body excluding the head (3, 3).\n    *   Length: 4 segments (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3).\n\n*   **Occupied Spaces (T10):**\n    *   ID 0: (3, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)\n    *   ID 1: (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (5, 3)\n\n*   **Apples:** A1(3, 9), A2(4, 8), A3(3, 6), A4(4, 7), A5(0, 3).\n\n**1. Identify Immediate Fatal Moves for ID 0 (Head at 3, 3):**\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Collision Check | Status |\n| :--- | :------------ | :-------------- | :----- |\n| UP | (3, 4) | Safe | Good |\n| DOWN | (3, 2) | **Self-Collision** (Into segment immediately behind head) | **FATAL** |\n| LEFT | (2, 3) | **Self-Collision** (Into segment (2, 3)) | **FATAL** |\n| RIGHT | (4, 3) | Safe | Good |\n\n*Fatal moves:* DOWN (moves into (3, 2)) and LEFT (moves into (2, 3)).\n\n*Safe moves:* UP (to 3, 4) and RIGHT (to 4, 3).\n\n**2. Evaluate Safe Moves & Apple Targets:**\n\nThe current cluster of high-value apples is in the top-right quadrant: (3, 9), (4, 8), (3, 6), (4, 7).\n\n*   Immediate target is A3 at (3, 6) (Manhattan Distance 3).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Distance to (3, 6) | Benefit |\n| :--- | :------------ | :------------------ | :------ |\n| **UP** | (3, 4) | 2 | Moves directly North, optimal path to (3, 6). |\n| **RIGHT**| (4, 3) | 4 | Moves East, slightly less efficient, but opens up (4, 7) or (4, 8) if A3 is contested. |\n\nThe UP move to (3, 4) is the optimal path step towards the closest apple, A3 (3, 6).\n\n**3. Evaluate Enemy Snake #1 (Head at 8, 3):**\n\nEnemy #1 is quite far from my target cluster. Its head is at (8, 3). Its body segments occupy (8, 2) down to (5, 3).\nEnemy #1's likely targets are apples in the top row or the cluster near the middle (3, 6) / (4, 7).\nThe closest apple cluster for the enemy is (8, 3) to (4, 7) or (4, 8), distances around 4-5 moves (assuming clearance).\n\nPossible safe moves for Enemy #1:\n1.  UP to (8, 4) (Towards the top wall/apples).\n2.  RIGHT to (9, 3) (Towards the corner/wall).\n3.  LEFT to (7, 3) (Moves parallel to my snake's movement path, but 4 units away).\n4.  DOWN to (8, 2) is a self-collision (FATAL).\n\n*   If Enemy #1 moves UP (8, 4), they continue their path on the right side.\n*   If Enemy #1 moves RIGHT (9, 3), they hug the wall.\n\nThere is no immediate collision risk with Enemy #1 for my planned move UP to (3, 4). My path to (3, 6) remains clear.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe move UP is safe, maximizes proximity to the high-priority apple at (3, 6), and minimizes the moves required to capture it.\n\n**Long-Term Plan for T11 and beyond:**\n1.  T11: Move UP to (3, 5).\n2.  T12: Move UP to (3, 6) - **Eats Apple A3**.\n3.  T13: Assess new position (3, 6) and pursue A4(4, 7) or A2(4, 8).\n\nUP",

I should definitely avoid DOWN since it would kill me by hitting my own body at (8,2). \n\nThe apples are concentrated in the upper-left quadrant: (3,9), (4,8), (3,6), (4,7), and there's one at (0,3). Snake #0 is at (3,3) and likely heading toward the apples above it.\n\nUP would continue my upward momentum toward the apple cluster, but I need to be careful about getting trapped against the top edge. LEFT would bring me closer to the center and potentially allow me to cut off snake #0's path to the apples.\n\n**Short-term plan for next 2-3 turns:** I should move LEFT to (7,3) to position myself more centrally. From there, I can either continue LEFT to approach the apple cluster or move UP to compete for the apples. This gives me more flexibility than moving UP immediately, which could box me in near the top-right corner. I need to anticipate snake #0's movements and potentially intercept its path to the remaining apples.\n\nLEFT",

I will use the *provided* Head/Body coordinates, assuming the order means Head (7,3), Segment 2 (8,3), Segment 3 (8,2), etc. This implies the snake moved LEFT from (8,3) to (7,3), and segment (5,2) is the tail.)\n*   **Apples:** A1(3, 9), A2(4, 8), A3(3, 6), A4(4, 7), A5(0, 3).\n*   **Closest Apple Target for ID 0:** A3 at (3, 6). Manhattan Distance: 2 (UP, UP).\n\n**1.

Predict Enemy Movement (ID 1 at 7, 3):**\n\nThe enemy snake is currently elongated horizontally/vertically near the bottom right. It has just moved to (7, 3). Potential safe moves for Snake 1:\n*   UP (7, 4): Towards the middle of the board.\n*   LEFT (6, 3): Safe, near my snake's territory.\n*   DOWN (7, 2): **Self-Collision** (into (7, 2), the 4th segment). **FATAL.**\n*   RIGHT (8, 3): **Self-Collision** (into (8, 3), the 2nd segment). **FATAL**.\n\nSnake 1's only safe moves are UP (7, 4) and LEFT (6, 3).\nSnake 1's closest apples are A4 (4, 7) or A2 (4, 8).\n*   If Snake 1 moves UP (7, 4), it moves toward the top apples.\n*   If Snake 1 moves LEFT (6, 3), it moves towards the center of the board.\n\nGiven its score lead, Snake 1 will likely pursue a clear apple. Moving UP to (7, 4) is a good strategic move for them to access the center-north apples.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves for ID 0:**\n\nMy goal is A3 at (3, 6).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Path to A3 (3, 6) | Safety/Contest |\n| :--- | :------------ | :---------------- | :-------------- |\n| **UP** | (3, 5) | Optimal. 1 move away from (3, 6). | Safe. Uncontested directly. |\n| **LEFT** | (2, 4) | Moves away from A3. | Safe, but poor direction. |\n| **RIGHT** | (4, 4) | Moves toward other apples (4, 7), (4, 8). | Safe, but worse path to (3, 6). Potentially better path to A4/A2. |\n\nThe move **UP** to (3, 5) keeps me on the fastest path to A3 (3, 6). This will allow me to eat A3 on the next turn (T12).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (4, 4), I increase my distance to A3 to 3 moves, but begin approaching A4 (4, 7) (3 moves away) and A2 (4, 8) (4 moves away). However, given my current Northward momentum and the close proximity of A3, sticking to the optimal path is best.\n\n**4. Check for Head-on Collision Risks:**\n\n*   My move: (3, 5).\n*   Snake 1's likely moves: (7, 4) or (6, 3).\n*   No path intersect or head-on collision risk exists.\n\n**5. Conclusion:**\n\nThe move **UP** to (3, 5) maintains the optimal trajectory towards the nearest apple at (3, 6).\n\n**Long-Term Plan for T12 and beyond:**\n1.  T12: Move UP to (3, 6) to eat Apple A3.\n2.  T13: Assess new position (3, 6). If Snake 1 continues north, they might contest A4 (4, 7) or A2 (4, 8). If A4 or A2 is uncontested and safe, move RIGHT/UP to pursue it. If A1 (3, 9) seems open, that is also a possibility.\n\nUP",

Conclusion:**\n\nMoving UP to (3, 6) is the immediate priority as it secures an apple and continues the snake's dominance in the center column.\n\n**Long-Term Plan for T13 and beyond:**\n1. T13 (Eaten A3): New Head (3, 6). Nearest apples are A4 (4, 7) or, if Snake 1 moves east, A2 (4, 8). Or, if clear, A1 (3, 9). Snake 1 generally seems to be moving away to the right/up quadrant.\n2. If A4 (4, 7) is open, moving RIGHT and then UP seems beneficial. If A1 (3, 9) is open, continue UP. Given the proximity and current direction, A1 (3, 9) is the next logical target if (3, 7) and (3, 8) are open. Let's aim for A1.\n\nUP",

This is a crucial move to secure A1 before the enemy can reposition.\n*   **RIGHT to (4, 6):** This prepares for potential moves to A3 (4, 7) or A2 (4, 8). This avoids a straight run into A1, but puts me adjacent to the 4-column cluster.\n*   **LEFT to (2, 6):** This moves towards A5 (1, 7), but it complicates reaching A1, A2, or A3, and takes me close to the edge of the board.\n\nSince A1 (3, 9) is only 3 steps away (UP, UP, UP) and directly in my current line, continuing UP is the most direct path to score again.\n\n**3. Predict Enemy Movement (ID 1 at 6, 4):**\n\nSnake 1 has a long chain of 6 segments and is in the process of moving north-west. Their body occupies (7, 4), (7, 3), (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2). They are currently at (6, 4).\n\nPossible Targets for Snake 1:\n*   A3 (4, 7): Distance 3.

Good approach for 4-column apples.\n*   RIGHT to (7, 4): **FATAL** (Into own body segment).\n\nSnake 1 is likely moving **UP** to (6, 5) or **LEFT** to (5, 4) to approach the target apples in the 4-column (A3, A2).\n\n**4. Check for Head-on Collision Risks:**\n\n*   My move: UP to (3, 7).\n*   Snake 1 likely moves to (6, 5) or (5, 4).\n*   No collision risk is apparent. The snakes are far apart.\n\n**5. Conclusion and Strategy:**\n\nThe priority is to reach A1 (3, 9) in the next two turns. To do this, I must move UP to (3, 7).\n\n**Long-Term Plan for T14 and beyond:**\n1. T14 (Move UP): New Head (3, 7). Target A1 (3, 9).\n2. T15 (Move UP): New Head (3, 8). Target A1 (3, 9).\n3. T16 (Move UP): Eat A1 (3, 9). Score +1.\n\nThis secures a point quickly and repositions the snake head high on the board. After eating A1, the snake will be long and positioned near the board edge. I will then need to figure out how to safely navigate down to A5 (1, 7) or, if Snake 1 has moved away, A2/A3.\n\nUP",

Moves toward the apple cluster.\n*   RIGHT to (7, 5): Safe.\n\nSnake #1 is likely trying to move LEFT to (5, 5) or UP to (6, 6) to angle towards A2/A3.\n\n**3. Evaluate Safe Moves for ID 0:**\n\nThe nearest apples are A3 (4, 7) - 1 step RIGHT, A1 (3, 9) - 2 steps UP, and A5 (1, 7) - 2 steps LEFT.\n\n*   **(A) RIGHT to (4, 7):** This eats Apple A3 immediately. (Score 5, Length 6). This is an excellent, immediate scoring opportunity that pulls me level with Snake #1.\n*   **(B) UP to (3, 8):** This moves towards A1 (3, 9). It takes 2 more turns to eat A1. This is a good move but slower than option (A).\n*   **(C) LEFT to (2, 7):** This moves towards A5 (1, 7). It would take 2 more turns to eat A5. This is slower and A5 is less centrally positioned than A3/A1.\n\n**Comparing Options (A) and (B):**\n\n*   Option (A) is a guaranteed point immediately, pulling the score to 5-5. It repositions my head right in the middle of the 4-column, adjacent to A2 (4, 8). After eating A3, my new position (4, 7) is adjacent to A2 (4, 8). Snake #1 is at (6, 5) and cannot reach A2 in 1 turn.\n    *   New Head: (4, 7). New Body: [(3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3)].\n\n*   Option (B) moves towards A1. It keeps me in the 3-column, which is a bit safer regarding Snake #1's position, but A1 is still two steps away.\n\nGiven the immediate scoring opportunity and the advantage of taking an apple away from the cluster that Snake #1 is approaching, **RIGHT** is the superior move. Taking A3 moves my head into position to potentially take A2 next turn (UP).\n\n**4. Check for Head-on Collision Risks (Move RIGHT to 4, 7):**\n\nThe only opponent is Snake #1 at (6, 5).\nIf Snake #1 moves:\n*   LEFT to (5, 5): No collision.\n*   UP to (6, 6): No collision.\n*   RIGHT to (7, 5): No collision.\n\nMy target (4, 7) is safe from Snake #1's possible moves.\n\n**5. Conclusion and Strategy:**\n\nThe move **RIGHT** secures a score, ties the game, and puts me in a strong position to contest A2 (4, 8) or A1 (3, 9) next turn.\n\n**Long-Term Plan for T15 and beyond:**\n1. T15 (Move UP after T14=RIGHT): New Head (4, 8) to eat A2. Score +1. Length 7.\n2. After T15, I will be at (4, 8) or (4, 7) and will decide between A1 (3, 9) or A5 (1, 7).

RIGHT would move me toward more open space on the right side of the board.\n\n**Collision Risk:** Snake #0 is at (3,7) and could move in various directions, but we're currently far enough apart that immediate collision isn't a major concern.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Continue moving UP to position myself for the apples at (4,7) and (4,8) while maintaining my lead. The upper area has more open space and multiple apple options. Avoid getting boxed in by my own body on the left side.\n\nUP",

Angles towards A5 (5, 8).\n*   RIGHT to (7, 6): Safe.\n\nSnake #1 is likely targeting A5 (5, 8), which is two steps away (e.g., LEFT then UP, or UP then LEFT).\n\n*   If Snake #1 moves UP to (6, 7): The distance to A5 (5, 8) becomes 2 steps (LEFT, UP).\n*   If Snake #1 moves LEFT to (5, 6): The distance to A5 (5, 8) becomes 2 steps (UP, UP).\n\n### 3. Evaluate Safe Moves for ID 0:\n\n**Objective:** Score immediately and maintain central control.\n\n*   **(A) UP to (4, 8):** This immediately consumes Apple A2. This moves me ahead 6-5. New length 7. New Head: (4, 8). New Body: [(4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3)].\n*   **(B) RIGHT to (5, 7):** This moves one step closer to A5 (5, 8). If Snake #1 moves UP to (6, 7) or LEFT to (5, 6), a head-on collision is unlikely, but Snake #1 gets closer to A5.\n*   **(C) DOWN to (4, 6):** Retreating, not useful for scoring immediately.\n\n**Priority is Option (A): UP.** This secures a point immediately, putting me in the lead and positioning my head nicely next to A5 (5, 8) and A1 (3, 9).\n\n### 4. Check for Head-on Collision Risks (Move UP to 4, 8):\n\nMy target is **(4, 8)**.\n\nThe opponent is Snake #1 at (6, 6). The minimum distance Snake #1 can travel to (4, 8) is 4 steps (LEFT, LEFT, UP, UP). There is no risk of a head-on collision or collision with the opponent's body segment at (4, 8) this turn.\n\n### 5. Conclusion and Strategy:\n\nMoving **UP** to eat the apple at (4, 8) secures the lead and positions me adjacent to the next cluster of apples (A5 at (5, 8) and A1 at (3, 9)).\n\n**Long-Term Plan for T16 and beyond:**\n1. T16 (Move decision after T15=UP to 4, 8): Head is at (4, 8). Nearest apples are A5 (5, 8) and A1 (3, 9).\n    *   **If Snake #1 moves LEFT (5, 6) or UP (6, 7):** Moving RIGHT to (5, 8) (A5) is a priority to keep scoring.\n    *   If Snake #1 manages to block A5, move LEFT or UP towards A1 (3, 9).\n\nUP",

Snake #0 is directly above me at (5,8), so moving DOWN creates immediate separation. The apple at (1,7) is also accessible via LEFT moves.\n\n**Collision Risk:**\nSnake #0 could move UP to (5,9), DOWN to (5,7) (which would kill me), LEFT to (4,8), or RIGHT to (6,8). The DOWN move is particularly dangerous since it would put them exactly where I am now.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Move DOWN to (5,6) to create distance from Snake #0 and position myself for the (4,6) apple.

Its length is 6.\n\nApples available: (3, 9), (0, 3), (1, 7), (8, 5), (4, 6)\n\n### 1. Analyze Previous Move & Opponent's Actual Move\n\n**My last move (T16):** I moved RIGHT from (4, 8) to **(5, 8)**, consuming the apple there. My body is now $[(4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3)]$. Since I grew, my tail (3, 3) remains.\n\n**Snake #1's last move (T16):**\n*   Previous Head: (6, 7).\n*   New Head: (5, 7).\n*   Snake #1 moved **LEFT** from (6, 7) to **(5, 7)**.\n*   Snake #1's new body is $[(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (7, 4)]$. Since it did not eat an apple (score is still 5), its tail (7, 4) was vacated, and the new tail is (7, 4). (Wait, the body coordinates provided are: $[(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (7, 4)]$. This is length 5. Head at (5, 7) makes total length 6. The previous turn's body must have been length 6, so one segment must have been vacated.)\n\nLet's reconfirm the body length and movement for Snake #1:\nCurrent Head (5, 7). Current Body $[(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (7, 4)]$. Total length 6.\nIf it moved LEFT from (6, 7) to (5, 7) and did not eat, the tail cell must have been vacated. The body list provided confirms the current state.\nThe snake is highly aggressive, moving directly below me into a position to challenge the adjacent apples.\n\n### 2. Identify and Eliminate Immediate Fatal Moves for ID 0 (Head at 5, 8)\n\nMy current body (excluding head): $B_0 = \\{(4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4), (3, 3)\\}$.\nEnemy body (Snake #1): $B_1 = \\{(6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4), (7, 4)\\}$.\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Collision Check | Status |\n| :--- | :------------ | :--------------- | :----- |\n| UP | (5, 9) | Apple A and Safe (Empty) | Safe. Moves towards A (3, 9). |\n| DOWN | (5, 7) | Enemy Head (Snake #1) | Simultaneous move risk (Head-on Collision) |\n| LEFT | (4, 8) | Self-Collision (Body segment) | **FATAL** |\n| RIGHT | (6, 8) | Safe (Empty) | Safe. |\n\n**Immediate Fatalities:**\n1. **LEFT (4, 8):** Collision with my own body segment. **FATAL.**\n\n**High Risk:**\n2. **DOWN (5, 7):** Snake #1's head is currently at (5, 7). If I move DOWN, and Snake #1 stays still (which is impossible, they must move), or if Snake #1 moves to (5, 8), (4, 7), or (6, 7), then my move DOWN is safe. But if they also move *UP* towards me, it's a head-on collision. If Snake #1 moves UP, their target is (5, 8) (my current position). If I move DOWN, my target is (5, 7). This is an open square trade, not a head-on collision.\n*Wait, simultaneous move rules:* My target is (5, 7). Snake #1's head is at (5, 7).\nIf Snake #1 moves:\n    *   UP to (5, 8): I hit their head at (5, 7) if they vacate it and I fill it. This is safe, and I capture their previous position.\n    *   DOWN to (5, 6): Safe for me.\n    *   LEFT to (4, 7): Safe for me.\n    *   RIGHT to (6, 7): Safe for me.\nTherefore, moving **DOWN to (5, 7)** is **SAFE** regarding head-on collision, as I am targeting Snake #1's current position, not their body (which moves) or their intended move target.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the risk of moving DOWN to (5, 7).\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 7), I target the square currently occupied by Snake #1's head.\nSince all moves are simultaneous, if Snake #1 moves away from (5, 7), the square becomes empty and I successfully occupy it. If Snake #1 targets (5, 8) (my current spot) and I target (5, 7) (their current spot), we swap places. This is a common maneuver and is safe.\nThe rule regarding head-on: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die (head-on collision).\" Since my target (5, 7) is currently occupied by Snake 1's head, and Snake 1 must move, we cannot collide head-on unless Snake 1 miraculously moves into the body part I just vacated, or if two snakes target an empty square. This move is safe.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Safe Moves\n\nRemaining Safe Moves: UP (5, 9), DOWN (5, 7), RIGHT (6, 8).\n\n**A. UP to (5, 9):**\n*   This square is empty.\n*   **Apple A(3, 9)** is 2 steps away (LEFT, UP/UP, LEFT).\n*   Snake #1's potential reaction: Snake #1 (at 5, 7) might go UP to (5, 8) to block me from A(3, 9) or to trap me between (5, 9) and (3, 9).\n\n**B. DOWN to (5, 7):**\n*   This is the spot Snake #1 just left.\n*   Snake #1 is now below me.\n*   If Snake #1 moves UP to (5, 8) (my old spot), we swap positions.\n*   This move retreats defensively and keeps the lead, but moves away from the nearest central apple A(4, 6) (distance 3).\n\n**C. RIGHT to (6, 8):**\n*   This square is empty.\n*   Allows potential pivot towards A(8, 5) (distance 3).\n*   If Snake #1 moves UP to (5, 8), this provides separation.\n\n### 4. Strategic Analysis and Apple Competition\n\nWe are at (5, 8).\nNearest apple (not eaten): A(3, 9) (d=3), A(4, 6) (d=2), A(1, 7) (d=4).\nSnake #1 is at (5, 7).\nNearest apple for Snake #1: A(4, 6) (d=2), A(1, 7) (d=4).\n\nSnake #1 is positioned aggressively right under me. They are likely aiming for A(4, 6) or attempting to block/trap me. A(4, 6) requires 2 steps (LEFT, DOWN from 5, 7).\n\n*   **Option UP (5, 9):** Pushes me towards the wall (9-boundary) but closer to A(3, 9). If Snake #1 goes LEFT/DOWN towards A(4, 6), I have space to move LEFT to (4, 9) then (3, 9).\n    *   If I move UP to (5, 9), Snake #1 is likely to move LEFT to (4, 7) or RIGHT to (6, 7), or UP to (5, 8) to block me.\n*   **Option DOWN (5, 7):** This is a defensive move, creating distance from the wall and allowing me to choose a clear path (LEFT or RIGHT) from a lower position. Crucially, it blocks Snake #1 from using (5, 7) to pivot defensively. If I move DOWN, Snake #1 is almost forced to move LEFT towards A(4, 6) or UP into my old position (5, 8).\n    *   If Snake #1 moves UP to (5, 8), this is a 1-turn perfect position swap. I am now at (5, 7), and I can race to A(4, 6) (1 step LEFT, 1 step DOWN).\n*   **Option RIGHT (6, 8):** Moves away from the competitive area (columns 3-5). A(8, 5) is 3 steps away. Snake #1 can move UP to (5, 8) and secure space, or LEFT/DOWN towards A(4, 6).\n\nIf I move **DOWN to (5, 7)**, and Snake #1 moves **UP to (5, 8)**, we swap places.\nFrom (5, 7), I am adjacent to: (4, 7) (body), (6, 7) (body), (5, 6) (empty).\nTo reach A(4, 6): Move LEFT to (4, 7) (FATAL into my own body, currently at (4, 7)), or move DOWN to (5, 6) then LEFT/LEFT/UP to A(4, 6)? No.\n\nLet's look at my body segments near (5, 7) again:\nMy body includes (4, 8) and (4, 7).\nIf I move DOWN to (5, 7):\n  *   Next move options from (5, 7):\n    *   LEFT to (4, 7): **FATAL** collision with my body.\n    *   DOWN to (5, 6): Safe. Distance 1 to column 5.\n    *   RIGHT to (6, 7): **FATAL** collision with Snake #1's body.\n  *   This move drastically limits my options on the next turn. **This is a terrible move.**\n\nLet's stick to **UP** or **RIGHT**.\n\n**Comparing UP (5, 9) and RIGHT (6, 8):**\n1. **UP (5, 9):**\n    *   Next potential move: LEFT to (4, 9). Then LEFT/DOWN to A(3, 9). (Total 2 steps to apple).\n    *   Reroutes competition towards the wall.\n2. **RIGHT (6, 8):**\n    *   Next potential move: UP to (6, 9) (wall), DOWN to (6, 7) (Snake 1 body), LEFT to (5, 8) (body). Limited movement.\n    *   If Snake #1 moves UP to (5, 8), they are between me and A(4, 6). I am trapped.\n\nIf I move **UP to (5, 9)**, my body is $\\{(5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), ...\\}$.\nSnake #1 is at (5, 7).\nIf Snake #1 moves UP to (5, 8), they have essentially blocked me in, forcing me to continue LEFT to (4, 9). They are now in a strong central position.\n\nIf Snake #1 moves aggressively down/left towards A(4, 6) (e.g., LEFT to (4, 7) - FATAL due to my body segment, or DOWN to (5, 6)):\n\nThe most pressing threat is Snake #1 capturing A(4, 6) or establishing a central blocking position at (5, 8).\n\nIf I move **UP to (5, 9)**:\n*   I aim for A(3, 9).\n*   If Snake #1 moves UP to (5, 8), they capture my old square and are 2 steps from A(4, 6) (DOWN, LEFT). I am still 2 steps from A(3, 9). Situation is generally equal, but I am in the corner.\n\nLet's pursue the apple A(3, 9) decisively now that I have the length advantage.\n\nMove **UP** to (5, 9).\nThis places me one step from the top boundary, but two steps from A(3, 9).\nIf I move UP, I can then safely move LEFT to (4, 9) (avoiding my body at 4, 8), and then DOWN or LEFT to (3, 9).\n\nFrom (5, 9):\n1. LEFT to (4, 9). Safe.\n2. RIGHT to (6, 9). Safe.\n3. DOWN to (5, 8) (Body). FATAL.\n\nWait, if I move UP to (5, 9), my body becomes (5, 8), (4, 8), ...\nIf I then move LEFT to (4, 9), I am safe. From (4, 9), I target A(3, 9) by moving LEFT. This is a 2-turn plan (UP, LEFT, LEFT).\n\nIf I move UP, Snake 1's options:\n*   UP to (5, 8): Blocks my retreat, controls center. But 3 steps away from A(3, 9).\n*   DOWN to (5, 6): Pursues A(4, 6).\n\nIf I move UP, and Snake #1 takes (5, 8), they are in a great position. But if they move away, I am cornered.\n\nLet's prioritize position control over immediate corner apple access. The open space is in the east/center. A(8, 5) presents a large scoring opportunity if Snake #1 focuses on A(4, 6).\n\nMove **RIGHT** to (6, 8).\nMy new body: $B_0 = \\{(5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), ...\\}$\nSnake #1 (5, 7) likely moves UP to (5, 8) or DOWN to (5, 6).\n\nCase 1: Snake #1 moves UP to (5, 8).\n*   T18: I am at (6, 8). Snake #1 is at (5, 8).\n*   My next moves: UP (to 6, 9, corner) or RIGHT (to 7, 8).\n*   If I move RIGHT to (7, 8), and Snake #1 moves LEFT or UP, I am moving towards A(8, 5). This is a safe pivot.\n\nCase 2: Snake #1 moves DOWN to (5, 6) (aiming for A(4, 6)).\n*   T18: I am at (6, 8). Snake #1 is at (5, 6).\n*   I can move DOWN to (6, 7) (FATAL, collision with Snake #1 body segment (6, 7)) or RIGHT to (7, 8).\n*   Wait, $B_1$ includes (6, 7). This means moving DOWN is fatal.\n\nIf $B_1$ includes (6, 7), then moving RIGHT forces me near their body segments.\n\nLet's re-examine the fatal move for RIGHT:\nCurrent head (5, 8). Target (6, 8). Safe.\nNext turn: Head (6, 8). Body: $(5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7), ...$\nSnake #1 (5, 7) must have moved.\nIf Snake #1 moved DOWN to (5, 6). Body: $(5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), ...$\nFrom (6, 8):\n*   LEFT to (5, 8) (My body). FATAL.\n*   DOWN to (6, 7) (Snake #1 body segment). FATAL.\n*   UP to (6, 9). Safe.\n*   RIGHT to (7, 8). Safe.\n\nIf I move RIGHT, I risk being trapped along the column 6 boundary.\n\nThe safest multi-step sequence is to pursue A(3, 9) near the boundaries, where there is less immediate risk of entanglement with Snake #1 who is central.\n\nMove **UP** to (5, 9).\n\n**T17 Strategy:** Move UP to (5, 9). Snake #1 will likely move to (5, 8) or towards A(4, 6). If they take (5, 8), I continue left towards A(3, 9). If they pursue A(4, 6), I capture A(3, 9).\n\nUP",

My length is 8.\nSnake #1 is at **(5, 6)**, having moved DOWN from (5, 7) (assuming they prioritized A(4, 6)). Its length is 6.\n\nApples available: (3, 9), (0, 3), (1, 7), (8, 5), (4, 6)\n\n### 1. Analyze Previous Move & Opponent's Actual Move\n\n**My last move (T17):** I moved **UP** from (5, 8) to **(5, 9)**. I did not eat an apple.\nMy body expanded (since I grew on T16), so the new body is: $[(5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4)]$. The tail (3, 4) was vacated, and the new tail is (3, 4) (Wait, if I grew on T16, the tail should have stayed at (3, 3). The new body list provided *is* the current body. Let's re-verify the length calculation based on the current state description: Head (5, 9) + Body (7 segments) = Length 8. This is consistent with 7 apples eaten. My tail is (3, 4)).\n\n**Snake #1's actual last move (T17):**\n*   Previous Head: (5, 7).\n*   New Head: (5, 6).\n*   Snake #1 moved **DOWN** to (5, 6). This confirms they are aiming for A(4, 6).\n*   Snake #1's new body is $[(5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)]$. Since they did not eat, their tail (6, 4) was vacated. Total length 6.\n\nBoard Status Summary:\n*   ID 0 Head: (5, 9). Target A(3, 9) (d=2, L, D) or A(4, 6) (d=3, L, L, D).\n*   ID 1 Head: (5, 6). Target A(4, 6) (d=1, L).\n\nSnake #1 is clearly moving to capture A(4, 6) this turn. I need to secure A(3, 9) while avoiding a corner trap.\n\n### 2. Identify and Eliminate Immediate Fatal Moves for ID 0 (Head at 5, 9)\n\nMy current body (excluding head): $B_0 = \\{(5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5), (3, 4)\\}$.\nEnemy body (Snake #1): $B_1 = \\{(5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)\\}$.\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Collision Check | Status |\n| :--- | :------------ | :--------------- | :----- |\n| UP | (5, 10) | Out of bounds (Y=10) | **FATAL** |\n| DOWN | (5, 8) | Self-Collision (Body segment) | **FATAL** |\n| LEFT | (4, 9) | Safe (Empty) | Safe. Moves towards A(3, 9). |\n| RIGHT | (6, 9) | Safe (Empty) | Safe. |\n\n**Immediate Fatalities:**\n1. **UP (5, 10):** Hitting the top wall (Y=9 is max). **FATAL.**\n2. **DOWN (5, 8):** Collision with my own body segment. **FATAL.**\n\n### 3. Evaluate Safe Moves\n\nRemaining Safe Moves: LEFT (4, 9), RIGHT (6, 9).\n\n**A. LEFT to (4, 9):**\n*   Moves directly closer to Apple A(3, 9) (1 step away).\n*   Next turn: Move LEFT to (3, 9) to eat the apple. This gives me 1 point.\n*   Keeps me along the wall, minimizing exposure to Snake #1 now that they are focusing on A(4, 6).\n\n**B. RIGHT to (6, 9):**\n*   Moves away from A(3, 9).\n*   Leads me to a dead-end corner (9, 9). Risky as it commits resources to a lower-value path unless I am aiming for the large space to the East.\n*   From (6, 9), the only safe move is DOWN to (6, 8) or continued RIGHT to the wall (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9).\n\n### 4. Strategic Decision\n\nSnake #1 is positioned at (5, 6) and will almost certainly move LEFT to (4, 6) to consume that apple.\n\n**Predicting Snake #1's move:** Snake #1 (5, 6) targets A(4, 6) (1 step LEFT). They will grow to length 7.\n\n**My Strategic Goal:** Secure A(3, 9) while Snake #1 takes A(4, 6).\n\nChoosing **LEFT to (4, 9)**:\n*   I secure the next-to-last move needed for A(3, 9).\n*   New Head: (4, 9). My body moves (5, 9) becomes the first segment of my body. The body segment at (3, 4) is vacated.\n*   On Turn 19, I move LEFT to (3, 9) and eat the apple. My length increases to 9.\n\nChoosing RIGHT to (6, 9):\n*   I waste a turn moving away from the nearest apple.\n*   I risk running into Snake #1's potential path if they decide to block me after eating A(4, 6).\n\nMoving LEFT is the most efficient and safest option to capture the valuable corner apple A(3, 9). This prevents Snake #1 from moving UP after eating A(4, 6) and trying to capture A(3, 9) before me.\n\n### Long-term plan (T19 onwards):\n1. T19: Move LEFT to (3, 9) and collect A(3, 9). Snake #1 will have just eaten A(4, 6) and will be at (4, 6), likely aiming for A(1, 7) or turning to the right/south.\n2. T20: After eating A(3, 9), my head is at (3, 9). My best move is DOWN to (3, 8) to secure space and move away from the top wall.\n3. Establish dominance in the area near A(1, 7) and A(0, 3).\n\nLEFT",

My current body is $B_0=[(5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5)]$. My length is 8.\nSnake #1 is at $H_1=(4, 6)$ (from $T_{18}$ moving LEFT). Its current body is $B_1=[(5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)]$. Snake #1 must have eaten the apple at (4, 6) in the previous turn, increasing its length to 7.\n\nWait, let's re-evaluate the state based on the provided list for T19, since the historical rationale was for T18.\n\n### Current State Analysis (T19)\n\n**Your snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: (4, 9).\n*   Body: [(5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5)]. Length 8.\n*   Last move: LEFT from (5, 9) to (4, 9).\n*   Since (4, 9) did not have an apple, the tail segment (3, 5) was vacated. $V_0 = (3, 5)$.\n\n**Enemy snake #1:**\n*   Head: (4, 6).\n*   Body: [(5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)]. Length 7. (Previous length was 6, so they ate an apple).\n*   Last move: Must have moved LEFT from (5, 6) to (4, 6), consuming A(4, 6).\n*   Vacated cell: (6, 4) (tail stayed put due to growth). $V_1 = \\emptyset$.\n\n**Apples Remaining:** (3, 9), (0, 3), (1, 7), (8, 5), (6, 2).\n\nThe analysis from the previous turn correctly predicted that Snake #1 would move to (4, 6) and eat the apple there. My move LEFT to (4, 9) puts me one step away from A(3, 9).\n\n### 1. Identify and Eliminate Immediate Fatal Moves for ID 0 (Head at 4, 9)\n\n**Obstacles:**\n*   Walls: X < 0, X > 9, Y < 0, Y > 9.\n*   My Body $B_0$: $\\left\\{(5, 9), (5, 8), (4, 8), (4, 7), (3, 7), (3, 6), (3, 5)\\right\\}$.\n*   Snake #1 Body $B_1$: $\\left\\{(5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)\\right\\}$.\n*   Snake #1 Head (Predicted position next turn): $H_1' = (4, 6) + \\text{move}$. (Need to predict T19 move.)\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Collision Check | Status |\n| :--- | :------------ | :--------------- | :----- |\n| UP | (4, 10) | Out of bounds (Y=10) | **FATAL** |\n| DOWN | (4, 8) | Self-Collision (Body segment) | **FATAL** |\n| LEFT | (3, 9) | Contains Apple A(3, 9) | Safe & Apple Capture. |\n| RIGHT | (5, 9) | Self-Collision (Body segment - direct backward move) | **FATAL** |\n\n**Immediate Fatalities:** UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nThe only safe move is **LEFT**.\n\n### 2. Confirm LEFT is safe against Snake #1\n\nMy move: LEFT to (3, 9). I capture A(3, 9).\n\nWhere could Snake #1 (at 4, 6) move?\nSnake #1 has just eaten and is 7 segments long. Snake #1's head is deep in the middle-left of the board.\nPossible non-fatal moves for Snake #1:\n1. UP to (4, 7): Hits body segment (4, 7) of ID 0. **FATAL (ID 1)**.\n2. DOWN to (4, 5): Safe. Moves away from the center of conflict.\n3. LEFT to (3, 6): Hits body segment (3, 6) of ID 0. **FATAL (ID 1)**.\n4. RIGHT to (5, 6): Hits body segment (5, 6) of ID 1 (direct backward move). **FATAL (ID 1)**.\n\nWait, let's re-examine Snake #1's body for its location (4, 6).\n$B_1 = [(5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5), (6, 4)]$.\nSnake #1 is at (4, 6).\n*   UP (4, 7): Body segment (4, 7) is mine (ID 0). **FATAL (ID 1)**.\n*   DOWN (4, 5): Safe.\n*   LEFT (3, 6): Body segment (3, 6) is mine (ID 0). **FATAL (ID 1)**.\n*   RIGHT (5, 6): Body segment (5, 6) is their own (first segment). **FATAL (ID 1)**.\n\nIt appears Snake #1, due to its position and my body configuration immediately surrounding it, has absolutely nowhere safe to move except **DOWN to (4, 5)**.\n\nMy move LEFT to (3, 9) is completely safe from collision with Snake #1, as Snake #1 is trapped in the bottom half of the board and must move D.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe move LEFT is the only non-fatal option, and it results in capturing an apple.\n\n### Strategy Note for Future Turns (T20 onwards)\nAfter moving LEFT, $H_0'=(3, 9)$. I will have 8 apples (Length 9).\nBased on the predicted movement, Snake #1 will be at $H_1'=(4, 5)$, Length 8.\n\nT20: From (3, 9), I need to escape the corner. The safest move is DOWN to (3, 8), which is not part of my body nor Snake #1's body segments. Then target A(1, 7).\n\nLEFT",

Snake #0 is positioned above me and could potentially cut off my options. The DOWN move keeps me alive but positions me away from most apples.\n\n**Collision Risk:**\nSnake #0 at (4,9) could move DOWN to (4,8), LEFT to (3,9), RIGHT to (5,9), or UP (off board). They're not an immediate threat to my DOWN move.\n\n**Long-term plan:** I need to prioritize survival and look for escape routes. After moving DOWN to (4,5), I should assess whether to continue DOWN toward the apple at (6,2) or try to loop around. My current position is risky with limited mobility - I need to create more space for myself.\n\nDOWN",

Identify and Eliminate Immediate Fatal Moves for ID 0 (Head at 3, 9)\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Collision Check | Status |\n| :--- | :------------ | :--------------- | :----- |\n| UP | (3, 10) | Out of bounds (Y=10) | **FATAL** |\n| DOWN | (3, 8) | Safe. | Safe. |\n| LEFT | (2, 9) | Safe. | Safe. |\n| RIGHT | (4, 9) | Self-Collision (Body segment) | **FATAL** |\n\n**Moves remaining:** DOWN, LEFT.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Safe Moves\n\n#### Candidate 1: DOWN to (3, 8)\n*   Safe from self-collision (4, 9) is the first segment.\n*   Moves me away from the wall.\n*   Puts me in a good position to move LEFT towards A(1, 7) or A(0, 3).\n\n#### Candidate 2: LEFT to (2, 9)\n*   Safe from self-collision.\n*   Keeps me along the top wall.\n*   Requires a tighter turn later to go towards A(1, 7). (Next move would be DOWN to (2, 8), then DOWN to (2, 7) or LEFT to (1, 9)).\n\nBoth moves are safe against static objects. We must check for potential head-on conflicts with Snake #1.\n\n### 3. Predicting Snake #1 Move (Head at 4, 5)\n\nSnake #1 (Length 7) must look for safety and apples. Target apple A(8, 5) or A(6, 2).\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1:\n1. UP to (4, 6): Snake #1's own body segment (first segment). **FATAL (ID 1)**.\n2. DOWN to (4, 4): Safe. Moves closer to A(6, 2) in the long run.\n3. LEFT to (3, 5): My tail segment (3, 5). If I do NOT move, this cell is occupied. If I move DOWN to (3, 8) or LEFT to (2, 9), my tail moves to (4, 9). *Wait, no, my tail is (3, 5). If I move, (3, 5) is vacated.* If $V_0 = (3, 5)$, then LEFT is safe for Snake #1.\n4. RIGHT to (5, 5): Safe. Moves towards A(8, 5).\n\nSince Snake #1 is not currently growing, its tail (6, 5) will be vacated. $V_1 = (6, 5)$.\n\nLet's look at the available moves for Snake #1:\n*   (4, 4): Safe.\n*   (3, 5): Safe, if I move and vacate that cell. It is currently my tail.\n*   (5, 5): Safe.\n\nSnake #1 is constrained but has options. $H_1=(4, 5)$ is far from $H_0=(3, 9)$. There is no risk of immediate collision (4, 5) is 4 steps away vertically (Y) and 1 step away horizontally (X) from my potential moves.\n\nChoosing **DOWN to (3, 8)** seems strategically superior as it moves me away from the wall and allows a natural path toward A(1, 7).\n\nIf I move DOWN, my head is at (3, 8). My body tail moves from (3, 5) to (3, 6). The formerly occupied cell (3, 5) is now empty.\n\nIf I move LEFT, my head is at (2, 9). My body tail moves from (3, 5) to (3, 6). The formerly occupied cell (3, 5) is now empty.\n\nI will prioritize getting off the top wall.\n\n**Preferred Move: DOWN to (3, 8).**\n\n### Strategy Note for Future Turns (T21 onwards)\nCurrent position: (3, 8), Length 9. Target A(1, 7).\nT21: Move LEFT to (2, 8).\nT22: Move DOWN to (2, 7) or LEFT to (1, 8)? A(1, 7) is adjacent to (2, 7).\nT23: Move DOWN to (2, 7), then LEFT to A(1, 7). This path (D, L, D, L) seems problematic.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the path to A(1, 7).\nH(3, 8) -> L (2, 8) -> L (1, 8) -> D (1, 7) [Apple]\nThis path is: L, L, D.\n\nIf I chose DOWN now:\nT20: DOWN (3, 8)\nT21: Should move LEFT to (2, 8).\nT22: Should move LEFT to (1, 8). *Check for conflicts*.\nT23: Should move DOWN to (1, 7) to get A(1, 7).\n\nThis seems like a solid, safe path.\n\nDOWN",

Moving DOWN to (4,4) would put me on a direct path toward it. Snake #0 is still positioned above me around (3,9), so moving DOWN creates more distance from the immediate threat.\n\n**Collision Risk:**\nSnake #0 could potentially move DOWN toward my position, but they're currently focused on the upper part of the board. Moving DOWN seems safest while also progressing toward the apple cluster in the lower left quadrant.\n\n**Long-term plan:** Continue working toward the apple at (6,2) while maintaining escape routes. Avoid getting trapped in the center - the lower left area has more open space and multiple apples. Watch Snake #0's movements carefully as they have more points and could try to cut me off.\n\nDOWN",

Predicting Snake #1 Move (Head at 4, 3)\n\nSnake #1 (Length 7) must look for apples A(0, 3), A(8, 5), A(6, 2), A(9, 6).\n$H_1$ is at (4, 3).\n* D((4, 3), (0, 3)) = 4 L\n* D((4, 3), (8, 5)) = 4 R, 2 U (6 moves)\n* D((4, 3), (6, 2)) = 2 R, 1 D (3 moves)\n\nSnake #1 will likely target A(6, 2) (3 moves away).\n\nPossible moves for Snake #1:\n1. UP to (4, 4): Self-Collision (Body segment). **FATAL (ID 1)**.\n2. DOWN to (4, 2): Safe. Good move towards A(6, 2).\n3. LEFT to (3, 3): Safe. Good move towards A(0, 3).\n4. RIGHT to (5, 3): Safe. Good move towards A(6, 2).\n\nSnake #1 has two equally viable options towards A(6, 2): DOWN or RIGHT. It might also choose LEFT towards A(0, 3) which is only slightly farther. Assuming it prioritizes A(6, 2), it will choose RIGHT or DOWN. Both moves keep it far from my snake.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 8), I am guaranteed to be safe and set up to eat the apple on T23.\n\n### 5. Strategy Note\n\nThe current plan is to secure A(1, 7).\nT22: LEFT to (1, 8).\nT23: DOWN to (1, 7) [Apple].\nAfter collecting A(1, 7), I will need to reassess the board, likely targeting A(0, 3) or A(8, 5). Given my proximity to the left wall, A(0, 3) seems like a next logical move, requiring 4 moves: (1, 7) -> (0, 7) -> (0, 6) -> (0, 5) -> (0, 4) -> (0, 3).\n\nLEFT",

Moving DOWN to (4,2) would put me one step closer while keeping options open. Snake #0 is still in the upper left area and appears to be heading toward either (1,7) or (0,3).\n\n**Collision Risk Assessment:**\nSnake #0's current position at (2,8) means they're several moves away from threatening me directly. The lower board area is mostly clear except for my own body creating some obstacles.\n\n**Path to Apple:**\nFrom (4,2), I can continue RIGHT to reach (6,2) while maintaining safe distance from Snake #0.

Snake #0 is still far away in the upper left corner hunting apples there. Going RIGHT to (6,2) lets me eat an apple and extend my lead.\n\n**Collision Risk Assessment:**\nSnake #0 is at (1,7) and their body suggests they're moving leftward toward (0,7) or possibly downward. They're too far to threaten me this turn. There's no risk of head-on collision.\n\n**Path Planning:**\nRIGHT moves me directly onto the apple at (6,2), giving me my 7th apple. After eating, I'll grow and need to plan my next move carefully. The other apples at (9,6) and (9,5) are now my next targets.\n\n**Future Strategy:**\nAfter securing this apple, I should consider moving toward the bottom-right area where there are multiple apples clustered. Snake #0 appears to be focusing on the left side, so the right side is relatively safe territory.\n\nRIGHT gives me immediate apple collection while keeping me away from Snake #0 and maintaining good positioning for future moves.\n\nRIGHT",

UP to (0, 8)**\n* **Outcome:** Moves to an empty space, away from $A(0, 3)$.\n* **Safety:** Safe.\n* **Benefit:** None immediately, poor pathing choice.\n\nThe move **DOWN** is the clear choice to pursue the current primary target $A(0, 3)$.\n\n### 3.

Our movement is confined to the left edge of the board, which is far removed from the enemy's likely path.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\n\nThe move **DOWN** is safe and directly progresses the goal of securing $A(0, 3)$.\n\n---\n**Long-term Plan for Future Self:**\nT25: Move DOWN to (0, 6). Target $A(0, 3)$.\nT26: Move DOWN to (0, 5).\nT27: Move DOWN to (0, 4).\nT28: Move DOWN to (0, 3) to eat $A(0, 3)$.\nAfter $A(0, 3)$ is secured, reassess remaining apples (8, 5), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4). Since the enemy is likely engaged on the right side, I should aim to cross the board, perhaps targeting $A(8, 5)$.\n\nDOWN",

My body now extends from (6,2) to (5,2) to (4,2), etc. \n\n**Apple Positioning:**\nThere are still apples at (0,3), (8,5), (9,6), (9,5), and (9,4). The cluster of apples in the top-right corner (x=8-9, y=4-6) is my most valuable target.\n\n**Enemy Snake Status:**\nSnake #0 is at (0,7) with a long body. They're focused on the left side of the board. They're 6 moves away from me if they came straight, but their body suggests they're moving leftward/upward.\n\n**Path Planning:**\nRIGHT to (7,2) gets me closer to the apple cluster in the top-right while keeping me safely away from Snake #0. From (7,2), I can then move UP toward the apples.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nNo immediate collision threats. Snake #0 is too far to reach me this turn.

Since the apple is guaranteed to be eaten in two more turns if I continue DOWN, yielding to a detour is unnecessary.\n\n**Choosing DOWN:** The goal is immediate apple acquisition at $A(0, 3)$. Moving DOWN guarantees this capture in two turns (T27 to (0, 4), T28 to (0, 3)).\n\n### 3.

No risk of collision with $H_1$ this turn.\n\n### 4.

(Length increases to 11).\n4.  **T29 (Post-apple):** Head at (0, 3). Since $A(0, 3)$ is the lowest apple, the next goal must be to travel across the board to the right side cluster, specifically targeting $A(8, 5)$, which is the lowest and most distant apple in that cluster (or whichever apple remains by T29). The path will likely involve moving RIGHT from (0, 3) to break the wall hug.\n\nDOWN",

Manhattan distance from $H_0(0, 5)$ is 2 steps (2 DOWN).\n\n### 1. Identify and Eliminate Immediate Fatal Moves for ID 0 (Head at 0, 5)\n\nWe must check collisions excluding the current tail cell $V_0(5, 9)$ and considering enemy body movement (which should vacate $V_1(4, 5)$).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Collision Check | Status |\n| :--- | :------------ | :--------------- | :----- |\n| UP | (0, 6) | Self-Collision (Neck segment (0, 6)). | **FATAL (Backwards)**. |\n| DOWN | (0, 4) | Empty (Apple $A(0, 3)$ is next turn). | Safe. |\n| LEFT | (-1, 5) | Off-board (X < 0). | **FATAL**. |\n| RIGHT | (1, 5) | Empty. | Safe. |\n\n**Safe Moves remaining:** DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n### 2.

Capture guaranteed in the next turn (T28), increasing my score lead and giving me a new length of 11.\n*   **Post-capture:** After eating, my head will be at (0, 3). I must then navigate toward the cluster of apples on the right side. Moving RIGHT from (0, 3) is the natural next step.\n\n**B. RIGHT to (1, 5)**\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Delays capturing $A(0, 3)$. While it prepares for the post-apple movement to the center, the apple at (0, 3) is currently undisputed. Delaying its capture is unnecessary and risks allowing $H_1$ to gain ground if they finish their current objective rapidly.\n\n**Decision for ID 0:** Continue DOWN to secure the apple at (0, 3).\n\n### 3.

There is no risk of head-to-head collision or hitting $H_1$'s body this turn.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan Update\n\n1.  **T27 (Current):** Move **DOWN** to (0, 4).\n2.  **T28:** Move DOWN to (0, 3) to eat $A(0, 3)$. (Length 11).\n3.  **T29 (Post-apple):** Head at (0, 3).

UP to (7,4) is also safe but doesn't progress me toward the apples as efficiently.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nRIGHT appears safest and most strategic. It maintains distance from my body and positions me for a direct approach to the apples.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE:**\nAfter RIGHT to (8,3), plan UP to (8,4) or (8,5) to target the apple cluster. The apples at (9,4), (9,5), (9,6) are high-value targets. Snake #0 is occupied on the left side, giving me time to secure these apples. Monitor if they start moving rightward.\n\nRIGHT",

Let's assume the body list provided is the *current* state before the move, and I should reference the enemy information as well to confirm if the tails move).\n\n*Self-Correction on Length/Tails*: The turn information shows:\nMy body: `[(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9)]` (9 body segments) + head (0, 4) = 10 segments.\nEnemy body: `[(7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4)]` (7 body segments) + head (8, 3) = 8 segments.\n\nMy last move was DOWN from (0, 5) to (0, 4).

While the enemy is far away, abandoning an immediate capture is usually poor strategy unless it leads to a significantly better positional advantage or a bigger trap setup. Given the score lead and the distance to the enemy, capturing the apple now is paramount.\n\n**Decision for ID 0:** Move DOWN.\n\n### 3.

Choosing DOWN is a priority since it captures an undisputed apple. My next desired move will be RIGHT to exit the corner and reposition toward the dense cluster of apples on the board's right side.\n\n$H_1$ is expected to move UP or RIGHT to capture one of the cluster apples immediately (e.g., $A(8, 5)$ or $A(9, 4)$).

No immediate collision risk.\n\n**Path Planning:**\nUP to (8,4) positions me perfectly for the apple cluster - it's the most direct route to (9,4) while keeping options open.

The cluster at (9,4)-(9,6) represents 3 easy apples. Snake #0 is still distant.

Length: 11 segments (10 collected apples + 1 initial segment).\nMy Body $B_0$: [(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 9)].\nVacated Cell $V_0$: (4, 9) (Since I grew last turn by eating A(0, 3)). Wait, the problem description implies my body length is 10 based on the 10 coordinates provided in the *current* body list, plus the head makes 11 segments. Since my score is 10, my length is 11. If length is 11, the tail (4, 9) does *not* vacate.\n\n*Correction on Length/Tail Movement*:\nLast Turn (T28), Head moved from (0, 4) to (0, 3). An apple was at (0, 3).\nMy length increased from 10 to 11.\nPrevious Tail was (4, 9).\nSince I grew, the new body list is $H_0$ (0, 3) followed by the old body. The old tail (4, 9) *remains* as a body segment.\nThus, **(4, 9) is NOT vacated.** Current list of my body segments (excluding head): $B_0$ contains (4, 9).\n\nEnemy Head $H_1$: (8, 4). Length: 8 segments (7 collected apples + 1 initial segment).\nEnemy Body $B_1$: [(8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3)].\nVacated Cell $V_1$: (4, 3) (Enemy's previous tail). (Assuming Snake #1 did *not* eat an apple.)\n\nApples $A$: (8, 5), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (5, 1). The apple at (0, 3) is gone.\n\nThe board is highly congested on the left (my body) and the middle/right (enemy body and most apples).\n\n### 1. Identify and Eliminate Immediate Fatal Moves for ID 0 (Head at 0, 3)\n\nThe coordinate (0, 2) is safe. (1, 3) is safe.\nMy next neck segment is (0, 4).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Collision Check | Status |\n| :--- | :------------ | :--------------- | :----- |\n| UP | (0, 4) | Self-Collision (Neck segment). | **FATAL (Backwards)**. |\n| DOWN | (0, 2) | Safe. | Safe. |\n| LEFT | (-1, 3) | Off-board (X < 0). | **FATAL**. |\n| RIGHT | (1, 3) | Safe. | Safe. |\n\n**Safe Moves remaining:** DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Safe Moves & Pathing Strategy\n\nI am currently in a tight corner at (0, 3), length 11. I need to get out and compete for the rich apple cluster on the right side of the board.\n\nThe general direction of movement should be RIGHT.\n\n**A. RIGHT to (1, 3)**\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Benefits:** This moves me away from the wall and begins repositioning me horizontally across the width of my body (which terminates around x=4). This is the intended long-term path.\n*   **Future:** From (1, 3), T30 options are UP (to 1, 4), RIGHT (to 2, 3), or DOWN (to 1, 2). All look safe and open.\n\n**B. DOWN to (0, 2)**\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Drawbacks:** Isolates me further against the left wall. If I move down to (0, 2), the only non-fatal move next turn is RIGHT (to 1, 2). This essentially delays getting to the RIGHT position (1, 3) by one turn compared to moving RIGHT immediately, and I might get trapped if the board fills up rapidly above me.\n\n**Decision for ID 0:** Moving RIGHT (1, 3) is superior as it immediately breaks free from the vertical alignment restricting my movement and opens up the full width of the board by T31.\n\n### 3. Estimate Enemy Snake #1's Move (Head at 8, 4)\n\n$H_1$ is at (8, 4). Length 8.\nApples $A_{1, nearest}$: (8, 5) [1 UP], (9, 4) [1 RIGHT].\n\n$H_1$ safe moves evaluation:\n1. UP (to 8, 5): Targets $A(8, 5)$. Immediate capture.\n2. DOWN (to 8, 3): **FATAL** (Backwards into neck (8, 3)).\n3. LEFT (to 7, 4): Safe.\n4. RIGHT (to 9, 4): Targets $A(9, 4)$. Immediate capture. (Note: $A(9, 6), A(9, 5)$ are 2, 3 steps away.)\n\nEnemy $H_1$ has *two* immediate apple captures: UP to (8, 5) or RIGHT to (9, 4). The enemy is currently scoring well (7 apples) and will likely take one of these.\n\n* If $H_1$ moves UP to (8, 5): Apple at (8, 5) captured. $H_1$ is positioned well for (9, 6) or (9, 5).\n* If $H_1$ moves RIGHT to (9, 4): Apple at (9, 4) captured. $H_1$ is positioned well for (9, 5) or (9, 6).\n\nIf $H_1$ moves UP to (8, 5), its tail (4, 3) remains. If $H_1$ moves RIGHT to (9, 4), its tail (4, 3) remains. The enemy is focused far away, and there is no risk of collision with my head at (1, 3). My move is purely positional.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan Update\n\n1. **T29 (Current):** Move **RIGHT** to (1, 3). Begin transversal movement towards the right side of the board to compete for the remaining four apples.\n2. **T30:** Head at (1, 3). Move RIGHT again to (2, 3) to continue traversing the open space below my body segments (Y $\\ge$ 4). This avoids re-entangling with the vertical segments on the left.\n3. **T31:** Head at (2, 3). Continue RIGHT (3, 3).\n4. **T32:** Head at (3, 3). Move RIGHT (4, 3). At this point, I will be adjacent to the enemy's vacated tail spot $V_1$ at (4, 3) from T29, although the enemy will have moved on. I need to be careful if my tail (4, 9) starts closing this area.\n\n**Constraint Check:** My head is moving parallel and distant from my long body extending from (0, 4) through (4, 9). Currently safe.\n\nThe optimal safe move is RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

I'm adjacent to two apples: UP gets (8,5), RIGHT gets (9,4). The cluster at (9,4)-(9,6) is particularly valuable. RIGHT to (9,4) is optimal - it collects an apple while positioning me perfectly for the rest of the cluster.\n\n**Enemy Threat Assessment:**\nSnake #0 is still far away at (0,3). No immediate collision risk.\n\n**Path and Space Analysis:**\nRIGHT to (9,4) gives me excellent options: UP to (9,5) for another apple, or DOWN to (9,3) if needed. My current position has limited upward-only growth potential, while moving right opens up the entire right column.\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\nBoth UP and RIGHT are safe apple-collecting moves. RIGHT is superior because:\n1. It positions me for sequential apple collection along the right edge\n2. It avoids potential trapping - moving UP then leaves me with fewer escape routes\n3. The right column offers more long-term growth potential\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE:**\nAfter RIGHT to (9,4) for the apple, plan UP to (9,5) and (9,6) to secure the apple cluster.

Thus, the tail segment (3, 9) must vacate, freeing up cell (3, 9).\n\nEnemy Head $H_1$: (9, 4). Length $L_1$: 9 segments (8 collected apples + 1 initial segment).\nEnemy Body $B_1$: [(8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3)].\nTail $T_1$: (4, 3).\nThe enemy scored 8 apples, implying a total length of 9. Assuming the enemy moved last turn, the tail segment (4, 3) will vacate unless they ate an apple.\n\nApples $A$: (8, 5), (9, 6), (9, 5), (5, 1), (0, 9).\n*Wait, comparing the previous analysis, the apple list for T29 included (9, 4), but the current list does not. It is likely Snake #1 took it since they were at (8, 4) and probably moved RIGHT to (9, 4).*\nIf $H_1$ moved from (8, 4) to (9, 4) (eating an apple), $L_1$ is now 9, and the tail (4, 3) **did not** vacate.\n\nLet's assume the enemy snake $H_1$ moved RIGHT to (9, 4) and ate an apple, resulting in $H_1$ now at (9, 4) and $L_1$ being 9. The new configuration is:\n$H_1$ (9, 4), $B_1$ [(8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3)].\n\nThis board data provided shows $H_1$ at (9, 4). This confirms the last move of $H_1$ was likely RIGHT (8,4) $\\to$ (9,4), eating an apple.\n\n**Free Cells (Vacating this turn, T30):**\nID 0: $T_0$ (3, 9) vacates $V_0$.\nID 1: $T_1$ (4, 3) remains occupied if $L_1=9$. The list of body segments provided for $H_1$ is 8 segments long. $H_1$ at (9, 4) + 8 body segments = Length 9. Since they ate an apple (Score 8 $\\to$ Score 9?), their length increased. Therefore, **(4, 3) remains occupied.**\n\nWait, the input data for T30 shows:\n* Your snake (ID 0) apples: 10 (Length 11)\n* Snake #1 apples: 8 (Length provided is 9 segments total including head)\n\nIf Snake #1 has 8 apples, its length is 9. If the head is at (9, 4) and the body is 8 segments long (8+1=9), and their score is 8, they must have eaten an apple *this* turn to get the new head position (9,4) and length 9.\nIf their score remained 8, their length is 9. If they moved without eating, the tail (4, 3) vacates.\nHowever, I must assume the provided coordinates are the *start* of Turn 30, and the previous turn's movement is complete.\n\n**Re-evaluating ID 0 Tail Movement:**\n$H_0$: (1, 3). $B_0$: [(0, 3)...(3, 9)]. $L_0=11$.\nT29 Move: RIGHT, from (0, 3) to (1, 3). No apple eaten.\nTail $T_0$ (3, 9) **vacates $V_0$**. Cell (3, 9) becomes free.\n\n**Re-evaluating ID 1 Tail Movement:**\n$H_1$: (9, 4). $B_1$: [(8, 4)...(4, 3)]. $L_1=9$.\nAssume T29 Move: RIGHT, from (8, 4) to (9, 4).\nIf apple was at (9, 4), $L_1$ increased to 9, and $T_1$ (4, 3) **remains occupied**.\nIf no apple was at (9, 4), $L_1$ remains 8, and $T_1$ (4, 3) would now vacate.\n\nGiven the apple count is 8 and the length is 9, I will conservatively assume that when the snake moved, if the cell it entered (9, 4) had an apple, its length increased, and the tail remains. If no apple was present, the body segments listed are the result of the move, and the old tail is now free. The image shows (9, 4) occupied by snake head '1'.\n\nI proceed assuming $T_0$ vacates (3, 9), and $T_1$ (4, 3) remains occupied (since $H_1$ is adjacent to two apples (9, 5), (9, 6) and scored 8, it is likely aggressive and growing).\n\n### 1. Identify and Eliminate Immediate Fatal Moves for ID 0 (Head at 1, 3)\n\nThe next body segment is (0, 3).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Collision Check | Status |\n| :--- | :------------ | :--------------- | :----- |\n| UP | (1, 4) | Safe. | Safe. |\n| DOWN | (1, 2) | Safe. | Safe. |\n| LEFT | (0, 3) | Self-Collision (Neck segment). | **FATAL (Backwards)**. |\n| RIGHT | (2, 3) | Safe. | Safe. |\n\n**Safe Moves remaining:** UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n### 2. Evaluate Safe Moves & Pathing Strategy\n\n$H_0$ is at (1, 3). I am moving toward the right side of the board to access the cluster of apples (8, 5), (9, 6), (9, 5), (5, 1). The snake's long body is up and left (Y $\\ge$ 4 and X $\\le$ 4).\n\n**A. RIGHT to (2, 3)**\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Benefits:** Continues the strategic movement across the board towards the apple cluster. Maintains a central position.\n*   **Future:** From (2, 3), T31 options are UP (2, 4), DOWN (2, 2), RIGHT (3, 3). All are open.\n\n**B. UP to (1, 4)**\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Drawbacks:** This positions me right below my dense vertical body wall [(0, 4) to (0, 7)] and parallel segments [(1, 7), (1, 8)]. While (1, 4) is safe, it limits my next turn options. If I move UP again (1, 5), I'm boxed against (0, 5) and (2, 5). If I move LEFT (0, 4), I self-collide.\n\n**C. DOWN to (1, 2)**\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Drawbacks:** Moves away from the action and towards the generally clear bottom rows. Apple (5, 1) is accessible this way, but it is far less efficient than moving horizontally. I want to keep momentum to the right.\n\n**Decision for ID 0:** Continuing RIGHT to (2, 3) is the best choice to maintain speed and strategic positioning.\n\n### 3. Estimate Enemy Snake #1's Move (Head at 9, 4)\n\n$H_1$ is at (9, 4). $L_1=9$.\nApples $A_{1, nearest}$: (9, 5) [1 UP], (9, 6) [2 UP].\n\n$H_1$ safe moves evaluation:\n1. UP (to 9, 5): Targets $A(9, 5)$. Immediate capture.\n2. DOWN (to 9, 3): Turns away from apples. Safe.\n3. LEFT (to 8, 4): **FATAL** (Backwards into neck (8, 4)).\n4. RIGHT (to 10, 4): **FATAL** (Off-board X=10).\n\nEnemy $H_1$ is almost certainly moving **UP** to (9, 5) to capture an apple and increase its lead.\n\n* If $H_1$ moves UP, it gets an apple and is positioned at (9, 5), threatening (9, 6). Its tail (4, 3) remains occupied.\n\nMy movement RIGHT to (2, 3) is far away from the active enemy movement, ensuring safety.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan Update\n\n1. **T30 (Current):** Move **RIGHT** to (2, 3). Secure open space and continue traversing the bottom edge of my body mass.\n2. **T31:** Head at (2, 3). Move RIGHT again to (3, 3).\n3. **T32:** Head at (3, 3). Move RIGHT again to (4, 3). This is potentially the cell that $T_1$ (4, 3) vacated two turns ago, or is still occupied if $H_1$ has been continuously growing. If $H_1$ moved UP twice (T30, T31) and grew twice, (4, 3) remains occupied. I need to check the status of (4, 3) at T32 carefully.\n4. **T33:** Head at (4, 3) or safe cell nearby. Target Apple (5, 1) or look for a gap in the center of the board.\n\nMy body $T_0$ will vacate (3, 9) at T30, (2, 9) at T31, (1, 9) at T32, and (0, 9) at T33, potentially capturing A(0, 9) if my body segments start shortening fast enough. Wait, $A(0, 9)$ is on the board. My tail is $T_0=(3, 9)$. If I move $\\to (2, 3)$, $T_0$ will be the previous segment of (3, 9) which is (3, 8).\n$H_0: (1, 3)$\n$B_0: [(0, 3) \\dots (3, 9)]$ (10 segments)\n$T_0$ is (3, 9).\nIf I move to (2, 3) and don't grow, the new body is:\n$B'_{0}: [(1, 3), (0, 3) \\dots (3, 8)]$ (10 segments)\nThe new tail is (3, 8). The cell (3, 9) is vacated.\n$T_0$ will crawl: (3, 9) $\\to$ (3, 8) $\\to$ (2, 8) $\\to$ (1, 8) $\\to$ (1, 7) $\\to$ (0, 7).\nThe apple $A(0, 9)$ is currently blocked by $T_0$'s move (3, 9). I cannot get to it easily.\n\nI will stick to the RIGHT movement strategy as it gives me the most open options.\n\nRIGHT",

No apple was eaten.*\n*Vacating Cell:* The former tail segment, (3, 9), was vacated on T30 (as (3, 8) became the new tail). **(3, 8)** is the current tail and will vacate this turn (T31) if I don't eat an apple.\n\nEnemy Head $H_1$: (9, 5). Length $L_1$: 10 segments (9 collected apples + 1 initial segment).\nEnemy Body $B_1$: [(9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3)].\nEnemy Tail $T_1$: (4, 3).\n*Last Turn (T30) Move: UP from (9, 4) to (9, 5). Snake #1 ate the apple at (9, 5), increasing its score to 9 and its length to 10.*\n*Vacating Cell:* Since $L_1$ increased, the tail segment (4, 3) **remains occupied**.\n\nApples $A$: (8, 5), (9, 6), (5, 1), (0, 9), (3, 4).\n*Note: A(9, 5) was eaten by $H_1$ last turn, confirming the pathfinding strategy of $H_1$ trying to take the lead.*\n\nCells occupied this turn by $B_0$:\n(1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8), (3, 8).

Evaluate Safe Moves & Pathing Strategy\n\nGoal: Move right to the center-right area, aiming for $A(8, 5), A(3, 4)$, or $A(5, 1)$.\n\n**A. RIGHT to (3, 3)**\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Benefits:** Continues the strategic movement right, away from the dense self-clutter on the left side of the board. Positions me well to access $A(3, 4)$ (1 UP) or $A(5, 1)$ (2 DOWN, 2 RIGHT).\n*   **Future:** From (3, 3), options are UP (3, 4) [Apple capture], DOWN (3, 2), RIGHT (4, 3) [Snake #1 Tail?].\n\n**B. UP to (2, 4)**\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Benefits:** Moves towards $A(3, 4)$.\n*   **Future:** From (2, 4), options are UP (2, 5), DOWN (2, 3) [Backwards], LEFT (1, 4) or RIGHT (3, 4) [Apple capture]. This is a good aggressive move.\n\n**C. DOWN to (2, 2)**\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Drawbacks:** Moves away from the two closest apples $A(3, 4)$ and $A(8, 5)$. Keeps me open near the board's bottom edge.\n\nComparing RIGHT to (3, 3) and UP to (2, 4):\n*   Moving **UP to (2, 4)** sets up an immediate apple capture next turn at (3, 4) if I move RIGHT.\n*   Moving **RIGHT to (3, 3)** sets up an immediate apple capture next turn at (3, 4) if I move UP.\nBoth positions lead directly to $A(3, 4)$ next turn. Moving UP seems slightly better as it elevates the snake's head away from the bottom corner constraints.\n\n### 3. Estimate Enemy Snake #1's Move (Head at 9, 5)\n\n$H_1$ is at (9, 5). $L_1=10$.\nApples $A_{1, nearest}$: (9, 6) [1 UP], (8, 5) [1 LEFT].\n\n$H_1$ safe moves evaluation:\n1. UP (to 9, 6): Targets $A(9, 6)$. Immediate capture.\n2. DOWN (to 9, 4): **FATAL** (Backwards into neck (9, 4)).\n3. LEFT (to 8, 5): Targets $A(8, 5)$. Immediate capture.\n4. RIGHT (to 10, 5): **FATAL** (Off-board X=10).\n\n$H_1$ has two excellent choices: UP to (9, 6) or LEFT to (8, 5). Since they just moved UP and are aiming for points, they are likely to take $A(9, 6)$ to continue clearing that corner, or $A(8, 5)$ if they want to move centrally.\n\n*Strategic Prediction:* $H_1$ will likely choose **UP to (9, 6)** to secure that isolated apple before moving towards the middle of the board, as it clears the corner.\n\nMy chosen move (UP to 2, 4) is very far from $H_1$'s predicted location, so there is no collision risk.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan Update\n\n1. **T31 (Current):** Move **UP** to (2, 4). (Sets up A(3, 4) access).\n2. **T32:** Head at (2, 4). Move **RIGHT** to (3, 4). Capture $A(3, 4)$. Length increases to 12. Tail (3, 8) remains occupied.\n3. **T33:** Head at (3, 4). New Apple at (3, 4). Length 12. Current body includes (2, 4). I can move UP towards the top left (A(0, 9)), or DOWN/RIGHT to access A(5, 1) or observe how $H_1$ is moving now that the corner apples are gone.\n\nWe choose **UP** to capture $A(3, 4)$ on the next turn.\n\nUP",

Length $L_0$: 11 segments (10 collected apples + 1 initial segment).\nMy Neck $N_0$: (2, 3).\nMy Tail $T_0$: (2, 8). (This is the cell that will be vacated if no apple is eaten). Note: The board state shows (2, 8) as T, which is consistent with the tail of the current body list: `[(2, 3), (1, 3), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 8)]`.\n\nEnemy Head $H_1$: (9, 6). Length $L_1$: 11 segments (10 collected apples + 1 initial segment).\nEnemy Neck $N_1$: (9, 5).\nEnemy Tail $T_1$: (4, 3).\n\nApples $A$: (8, 5), (5, 1), (0, 9), (3, 4), (8, 1).\nThe apple at (3, 4) is 1 move away (RIGHT) from my current head position (2, 4). This confirms the plan from T31: I moved UP to (2, 4) to set up this capture.\n\n### 1. Identify and Eliminate Immediate Fatal Moves for ID 0 (Head at 2, 4)\n\nMy Neck is at (2, 3).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Collision Check | Status |\n| :--- | :------------ | :--------------- | :----- |\n| UP | (2, 5) | Wall: No, Self: No, Enemy: No. Apple: No. | Safe. |\n| DOWN | (2, 3) | Self-Collision (Neck segment). | **FATAL (Backwards)**. |\n| LEFT | (1, 4) | Wall: No, Self: No, Enemy: No. Enemy Head: Unlikely. | Safe. |\n| RIGHT | (3, 4) | Wall: No, Self: No, Enemy: No. **Apple: Yes.** | Safe (Immediate Capture). |\n\n**Safe Moves remaining:** UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n### 2. Analysis of Safe Moves\n\nThe priority is to capture the immediately available apple at (3, 4).\n\n**A. RIGHT to (3, 4)**\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Outcome:** Captures $A(3, 4)$. My length increases to 12. Score increases to 11.\n*   **Board Changes:** The cell (2, 8) remains occupied (since I eat). A new apple spawns.\n*   **Future:** Head is now at (3, 4). Good central position, opening options to go down towards $A(5, 1)$, or maneuver towards $A(8, 5)$.\n\n**B. UP to (2, 5)**\n*   **Drawbacks:** Ignores the immediate apple, allowing the enemy to close the score gap or potentially block access to it later (though unlikely here). It moves me towards crowded territory (my body segment (0, 5) and (0, 6)).\n\n**C. LEFT to (1, 4)**\n*   **Drawbacks:** Ignores the immediate apple. Moves me closer to my dense body segments on the left side, which limits future movement.\n\nThe **RIGHT** move is clearly optimal as it secures a point and increases my lead/length.\n\n### 3. Estimate Enemy Snake #1's Move (Head at 9, 6)\n\n$H_1$ is at (9, 6). $N_1$ is at (9, 5). $L_1=11$.\nApples $A_{1, nearest}$: (8, 5) [1 LEFT], (0, 9) [far], (8, 1) [far].\n$H_1$ safe moves evaluation:\n1. UP (to 9, 7): Safe.\n2. DOWN (to 9, 5): **FATAL** (Backwards into neck).\n3. LEFT (to 8, 6): Safe.\n4. RIGHT (to 10, 6): **FATAL** (Off-board X=10).\n\nThe priority targets for $H_1$ are (8, 5) (Distance 2, via 8, 6 or 9, 5 (blocked) or 9, 7 then 8, 7 then 8, 6 then 8, 5 - too complicated) or (8, 5) via (8, 6) then (8, 5).\n$H_1$ must choose between moving LEFT or UP.\nIf $H_1$ moves **LEFT to (8, 6)**, it sets up for $A(8, 5)$ next turn (by moving DOWN). This is highly probable as it is the shortest path to an available apple.\nIf $H_1$ moves **UP to (9, 7)**, it moves farther from the nearest apple (8, 5) and restricts future options in the corner.\n\n*Strategic Prediction:* $H_1$ chooses **LEFT to (8, 6)** to target $A(8, 5)$ next turn.\n\nMy chosen move RIGHT to (3, 4) is completely unconcerned by the enemy's move, as we are separated by significant distance.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan Update\n\n1. **T32 (Current):** Move **RIGHT** to (3, 4). Capture $A(3, 4)$. Score 11. New tail: (2, 8) remains occupied. $H_1$ predicted to move LEFT to (8, 6).\n2. **T33 (Head at 3, 4):** A new apple will have spawned. $A(8, 5)$ will likely be captured by $H_1$. My viable targets will be $A(5, 1)$ (3 RIGHT, 3 DOWN) or $A(0, 9)$ (3 LEFT, 5 UP) or $A(8, 1)$ (5 RIGHT, 3 DOWN). I should track $H_1$ and aim for $A(5, 1)$ or $A(8, 1)$ to extend towards the bottom right of the board, keeping options open.\n\nRIGHT",

Tied with snake #0 at 11 apples each.\n- Apples remaining: (8,5), (5,1), (0,9), (3,4), (8,1)\n\n**Safety Check for Next Move:**\n- UP: Off board (y=10) - DEADLY\n- DOWN to (9,5): Occupied by my own body - DEADLY  \n- LEFT to (8,6): Empty - SAFE\n- RIGHT: Off board (x=10) - DEADLY\n\nOnly LEFT to (8,6) is safe.\n\n**Apple Proximity:**\nLEFT to (8,6) positions me perfectly for the apple at (8,5) next turn.\n\n**Enemy Threat Assessment:**\nSnake #0 is at (2,4) - still very distant. No immediate collision risk. It appears to be working the left side while I'm dominating the right side.\n\n**Space Analysis:**\nAfter moving LEFT to (8,6), I'll have multiple safe options: DOWN to (8,5) (apple), UP to (8,7) (empty), or potentially LEFT to (7,6) depending on what I see next turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE:**\nContinue securing the top-right area. Next turn after LEFT, plan to DOWN to (8,5) for apple #12. This gives me the lead. Then assess whether to continue down the right edge or work toward the center. The apple at (8,1) is also accessible from the right side. Maintain my position advantage in the less contested right territory while snake #0 occupies the crowded left side.\n\nLEFT",

Analysis and Prediction of Enemy Snake #1's Move (Head at 8, 6)\n\n$H_1$ is at (8, 6). $N_1$ is at (9, 6). $L_1=11$.\nNearest Apple for $H_1$: $A(8, 5)$, which is 1 move DOWN.\n\n$H_1$ safe moves:\n1.

RIGHT (to 9, 6): **FATAL** (Backwards into neck).\n\n**Prediction for $H_1$:** $H_1$ will move **DOWN to (8, 5)** to capture the apple, increasing its score to 11 and its length to 12.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Safe Moves for ID 0 (Head at 3, 4)\n\nCurrent $H_0$: (3, 4). Length 12. Score 11.\nEnemy $H_1$ is likely going to (8, 5).\n\nRemaining Apples: (5, 1), (0, 9), (8, 1), (0, 1).\n\n**Target Selection:**\nWe need to pick a target that is reachable and minimally contested.\n1. $A(5, 1)$: Distance 2 RIGHT, 3 DOWN. Total 5 moves.\n2. $A(8, 1)$: Distance 5 RIGHT, 3 DOWN. Total 8 moves.\n3. $A(0, 9)$: Distance 3 LEFT, 5 UP. Total 8 moves.\n4. $A(0, 1)$: Distance 3 LEFT, 3 DOWN. Total 6 moves.\n\nThe apple $A(5, 1)$ is the closest at $D=5$. $A(0, 1)$ is second closest at $D=6$.\n\n**Optimal Direction is generally towards $A(5, 1)$ or $A(8, 1)$ to move away from my own body cluster on the left.**\n\n**A. Move DOWN to (3, 3)**\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Impact:** Moves directly towards $A(5, 1)$ (D=4) and $A(8, 1)$ (D=7).\n*   **Future:** Keeps the body relatively straight and avoids crowding the center-left. Excellent path control.\n\n**B. Move RIGHT to (4, 4)**\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Impact:** Moves towards $A(5, 1)$ (D=4) and $A(8, 1)$ (D=7).\n*   **Future:** This is a good intermediate move, but moving DOWN first sets up the vertical descent better.\n\n**C. Move UP to (3, 5)**\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Impact:** Moves away from all nearest apples. Moves toward $A(0, 9)$ (D=9). Moves toward the center-top where my body is denser. Less preferred.\n\nComparing DOWN and RIGHT:\n| Move | New Head (3, 3) | New Head (4, 4) |\n| :--- | :-------------- | :-------------- |\n| To A(5, 1) | D=4 (2 R, 2 D) | D=4 (1 R, 3 D) |\n| To A(8, 1) | D=7 (5 R, 2 D) | D=7 (4 R, 3 D) |\n\nBoth moves reduce the distance to $A(5, 1)$ identically, but the path from (3, 3) is more open, using less crowded columns (3 and 4 are open below 4). The path from (4, 4) might require immediate DOWN moves, which is fine, but starting with DOWN is more decisive for the bottom half of the board.\n\nI choose **DOWN** to start the descent towards $A(5, 1)$. This also opens up the area around (3, 4) for future maneuvering if needed.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan Update\n\n1. **T33 (Current):** Move **DOWN** to (3, 3). Target $A(5, 1)$. Enemy $H_1$ captures $A(8, 5)$. Scores: ID 0: 11, ID 1: 11.\n2. **T34 (Head at 3, 3):** Needs to continue right and down. Probably **RIGHT** to (4, 3) to prepare for $A(5, 1)$ (1R, 2D away).\n3. **T35 (Head at 4, 3):** **RIGHT** to (5, 3). $A(5, 1)$ is now 2 DOWN.\n4. **T36 (Head at 5, 3):** **DOWN** to (5, 2). $A(5, 1)$ is 1 DOWN.\n5. **T37 (Head at 5, 2):** **DOWN** to (5, 1). Capture $A(5, 1)$.\n\nThis multi-turn plan seems safe and focuses on securing the next known apple. I must watch for where the enemy moves next after T33, as they will likely target $A(8, 1)$ or turn back to the top half for $A(0, 9)$.\n\nDOWN",

This is the most valuable immediate move.\n\n**Enemy Assessment:**\nSnake #0 is at (3,4) - still distant. No immediate collision risk. It's working the left side while I control the right.\n\n**Space Analysis:**\nAfter DOWN to (8,5), I'll have multiple safe options: LEFT to (7,5), RIGHT to (9,5) (though my body will be at (9,5) next turn), or potentially UP to (8,6) (but my body will be there). Need to check future mobility.\n\n**Future Mobility Check:**\nIf I go DOWN to (8,5) and eat the apple, my tail will stay put, so my body will extend. Next turn from (8,5), my safe moves would be LEFT to (7,5) and RIGHT to (9,5). This maintains good mobility along the right edge.\n\n**Alternative Consideration:**\nUP to (8,7) is safe but doesn't get me closer to immediate points. LEFT to (7,6) is safe but also delays apple collection. Given that snake #0 has 11 apples vs my 10, I need to prioritize catching up.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nSecure the apple at (8,5) to tie the score. Then work my way down the right side toward the apple at (8,1). The right side remains less contested. After eating (8,5), consider moving left to (7,5) to maintain flexibility and avoid getting trapped against the top edge.\n\nDOWN",

Snake #1 moved DOWN, capturing the apple at (8, 5). $L_1$: 12 segments.\nEnemy new Body: [(8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2), (4, 2)].\nEnemy Tail $T_1$: (4, 2) remains. $T_1$ is now (5, 2).\n\nApples $A$: (5, 1), (0, 9), (8, 1), (0, 1), (4, 9). (Note: A new apple has spawned at (4, 9) because (8, 5) was eaten).\n\nScores: ID 0: 11, ID 1: 12. Snake #1 is now ahead.\n\n### 1. Identify and Eliminate Immediate Fatal Moves for ID 0 (Head at 3, 3)\n\nMy Neck $N_0$ is at (3, 4).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Collision Check | Status |\n| :--- | :------------ | :--------------- | :----- |\n| UP | (3, 4) | Self-Collision (Neck segment). | **FATAL (Backwards)**. |\n| DOWN | (3, 2) | Wall: No, Self: No. Enemy: No. | Safe. |\n| LEFT | (2, 3) | Self-Collision (Body segment: (2, 3)). | **FATAL**. |\n| RIGHT | (4, 3) | Wall: No, Self: No. Enemy: No. | Safe. |\n\n**Safe Moves remaining:** DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n### 2. Analysis and Prediction of Enemy Snake #1's Move (Head at 8, 5)\n\n$H_1$ is at (8, 5). $N_1$ is at (8, 6). $L_1=12$.\nNearest Apple for $H_1$: $A(8, 1)$, distance 4 DOWN.\n\n$H_1$ safe moves (before prediction):\n1. UP (to 8, 6): **FATAL** (Backwards into neck).\n2. DOWN (to 8, 4): Safe. Moves directly towards $A(8, 1)$.\n3. LEFT (to 7, 5): Safe. Good path but away from $A(8, 1)$.\n4. RIGHT (to 9, 5): Safe. But $N_1$ is at (8, 6), Body includes (9, 6), (9, 5). Collision at (9, 5). Wait, $N_1$ is (8, 6). The body is (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5)... Moving right to (9, 5) is into the body segment. **FATAL**. (Checking board state: H1=(8, 5), B1=[(8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5)...] Yes, moving RIGHT to (9, 5) is a self-collision).\n\n**Safe Moves for $H_1$:** DOWN, LEFT.\n\n**Prediction for $H_1$:** $H_1$ will move **DOWN to (8, 4)** to target $A(8, 1)$ (D=3). This is the most logical move for the enemy snake to increase its lead.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Safe Moves for ID 0 (Head at 3, 3)\n\nCurrent $H_0$: (3, 3). Length 11. Score 11.\nTarget: $A(5, 1)$ (Distance 2 RIGHT, 2 DOWN = 4 moves).\n\n**A. Move RIGHT to (4, 3)**\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Impact:** Reduces distance to $A(5, 1)$ to 3 moves (1 R, 2 D). This follows the plan from the previous turn.\n*   **Future:** (4, 3) is safe and sets up the final approach to $A(5, 1)$.\n\n**B. Move DOWN to (3, 2)**\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Impact:** Reduces distance to $A(5, 1)$ to 3 moves (2 R, 1 D). Also a good move.\n\nComparing RIGHT and DOWN:\nMoving RIGHT to (4, 3) is strategically better. If I move DOWN to (3, 2), I have the option of RIGHT to (4, 2) or DOWN to (3, 1) next turn. However, $A(5, 1)$ requires me to be at X=5. Moving RIGHT now means I can take two RIGHT moves to X=5, then two DOWN moves to Y=1. If I move DOWN now, I might run into my body segment (2, 3) which is only one space away.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** (to 4, 3):\n- Next options (T35): UP (to 4, 4 - safe), DOWN (to 4, 2 - safe, but next to E-body (5, 2)), LEFT (to 3, 3 - safe), RIGHT (to 5, 3 - safe, 2 D from apple).\n- The path (3, 3) -> (4, 3) -> (5, 3) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 1) seems optimal and fast (4 moves total).\n\nIf I move **DOWN** (to 3, 2):\n- Next options (T35): UP (to 3, 3 - safe), DOWN (to 3, 1 - safe), LEFT (to 2, 2 - safe, but near my body mass), RIGHT (to 4, 2 - safe).\n- Path: (3, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (4, 2) -> (5, 2) -> (5, 1). This involves (4, 2) and (5, 2). $H_1$'s tail is about to leave (5, 2) this turn, making it safe for me in two turns. My enemy's body is (5, 2) (6, 2) (7, 2). If I move to (4, 2) on T35, I am very close to the enemy body.\n\nThe path starting with **RIGHT** to (4, 3) seems slightly cleaner and less likely to run into the current or predicted body position of Snake #1, which is focused on the **(8, 1)** side.\n\nI will stick to the plan of moving RIGHT.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan Update\n\n1. **T34 (Current):** Move **RIGHT** to (4, 3). Target $A(5, 1)$. Enemy $H_1$ likely moves DOWN to (8, 4).\n2. **T35 (Head at 4, 3):** Move **RIGHT** to (5, 3). $A(5, 1)$ is 2 DOWN.\n3. **T36 (Head at 5, 3):** Move **DOWN** to (5, 2). $A(5, 1)$ is 1 DOWN. (Need to confirm E-body is clear of (5, 2)). Since $L_1=12$ and $T_1=(5, 2)$ at T34, $T_1$ will move to (6, 2) at T35, freeing (5, 2).\n4. **T37 (Head at 5, 2):** Move **DOWN** to (5, 1). Capture $A(5, 1)$.\n\nThis plan maintains focus on closing the score gap, minimizing conflict with the opponent who is focused on the other side of the board.\n\nRIGHT",

This suggests $H_1$ moved LEFT from (8, 5) to (7, 5) on the previous turn (T34), not DOWN as predicted in the last rationale.\nEnemy length $L_1$: 12 segments. Score 11.\nEnemy Body: [(8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2), (5, 2)]. (Length 11 + Head = 12 total).\n\nApples $A$: (5, 1), (0, 9), (8, 1), (0, 1), (4, 9).\n\nScores: ID 0: 11, ID 1: 11. The scores are tied, not 11 vs 12 as previously assumed, meaning no apple was captured at T34. The previous rationale incorrectly assumed Snake #1 captured (8, 5) at T34; this assumption was based on the score reporting (ID 1 apples: 12) in the Rationale, which conflicts with the current scores (ID 1 apples: 11). I will rely on the current score report: 11 vs 11.\n\n**Recalculated movement based on board position and enemy:**\n*   My snake moved RIGHT: (3, 3) -> (4, 3). Body [(4, 3), (3, 3), (3, 4)...]\n*   Enemy Snake #1 moved LEFT: (8, 5) $\\rightarrow$ (7, 5). Body [(7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6)...]\n\n$H_0$ is at (4, 3). $N_0$ is at (3, 3).\n$H_1$ is at (7, 5). $N_1$ is at (8, 5).\n\nTarget: $A(5, 1)$ is the nearest apple. Manhattan Distance: $|5-4| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\n### 1. Identify and Eliminate Immediate Fatal Moves for ID 0 (Head at 4, 3)\n\nMy Neck $N_0$ is at (3, 3).\nObstacles include: My Body (T), Enemy Body (1), Walls.\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Collision Check | Status |\n| :--- | :------------ | :--------------- | :----- |\n| UP | (4, 4) | Wall: No. Self: No. Enemy: No. | Safe. |\n| DOWN | (4, 2) | Wall: No. Self: No. Enemy: Body segment (5, 2) is 1 space SW. | Safe. |\n| LEFT | (3, 3) | Self-Collision (Neck segment). | **FATAL (Backwards)**. |\n| RIGHT | (5, 3) | Wall: No. Self: No. Enemy: No. | Safe. |\n\n**Safe Moves remaining:** UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n### 2. Analysis and Prediction of Enemy Snake #1's Move (Head at 7, 5)\n\n$H_1$ is at (7, 5). $N_1$ is at (8, 5). $L_1=12$.\n$H_1$ is now facing a decision point, having moved away from $A(8, 1)$ slightly.\n\nNearest Apples for $H_1$:\n1. $A(8, 1)$: Distance $|8-7| + |1-5| = 1 + 4 = 5$.\n2. $A(5, 1)$: Distance $|5-7| + |1-5| = 2 + 4 = 6$.\n3. $A(4, 9)$: Distance $|4-7| + |9-5| = 3 + 4 = 7$.\n\nSafe moves for $H_1$:\n1. UP (to 7, 6): Safe. Moves away from apples.\n2. DOWN (to 7, 4): Safe. Moves toward $A(8, 1)$.\n3. LEFT (to 6, 5): Safe. Moves away from $A(8, 1)$.\n4. RIGHT (to 8, 5): **FATAL** (Backwards into neck).\n\n**Prediction:** $H_1$ is likely to move **DOWN to (7, 4)** to position itself for a move towards $A(8, 1)$.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Safe Moves for ID 0 (Head at 4, 3)\n\nThe previous plan was: (4, 3) $\\rightarrow$ (5, 3) $\\rightarrow$ (5, 2) $\\rightarrow$ (5, 1).\n\n**A. Move RIGHT to (5, 3)** (Pursuing $A(5, 1)$)\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Impact:** Reduces distance to $A(5, 1)$ to 2 (0 RIGHT, 2 DOWN). This is the key step in the 3-turn plan to acquire the apple.\n*   **Future (T36):** From (5, 3), moves DOWN to (5, 2) is 1 move from the apple. Snake 1's tail $T_1$ is at (5, 2) now. If $H_1$ moves DOWN to (7, 4) (as predicted), $T_1$ moves to (6, 2). Thus (5, 2) is free for me next turn.\n*   *Conclusion:* Very strong move, executes the intended plan.\n\n**B. Move DOWN to (4, 2)** (Slightly alternate path to $A(5, 1)$)\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Impact:** Reduces distance to $A(5, 1)$ to 2 (1 RIGHT, 1 DOWN).\n*   **Future (T36):** From (4, 2), options are: RIGHT to (5, 2) or DOWN to (4, 1). Moving RIGHT to (5, 2) is safe (as $T_1$ moves to (6, 2) if $H_1$ moves DOWN). This path is also efficient.\n\n**C. Move UP to (4, 4)** (Exploring other options/escaping density)\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Impact:** Increases distance to $A(5, 1)$ to 4. Starts moving towards $A(4, 9)$ (D=5).\n*   *Conclusion:* Not optimal as $A(5, 1)$ is so close and accessible.\n\nComparing RIGHT and DOWN: Both put me 2 moves from the apple.\n*   RIGHT to (5, 3) requires DOWN, then DOWN.\n*   DOWN to (4, 2) requires RIGHT, then DOWN (or DOWN, then RIGHT, which is worse).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (5, 3) sets up a perfectly straight line approach (5, 3) $\\rightarrow$ (5, 2) $\\rightarrow$ (5, 1), which is robust and fast.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan Update\n\n$H_0$ is at (4, 3). Target $A(5, 1)$. Snake #1 is near the right wall, targeting $A(8, 1)$.\n1. **T35 (Current):** Move **RIGHT** to (5, 3). $H_1$ predicted DOWN to (7, 4). $T_1$ moves to (6, 2).\n2. **T36 (Head at 5, 3):** Move **DOWN** to (5, 2). (Safe, since E-tail cleared (5, 2)).\n3. **T37 (Head at 5, 2):** Move **DOWN** to (5, 1). Capture $A(5, 1)$.\n\nThis plan remains sound and avoids conflict.\n\nRIGHT",

They seem to be working the left side. Immediate collision risk appears low unless they move toward the center-right area I'm in.\n\n**Apple Access Strategy:**\n- (8,1) is very close - just 4 moves away via DOWN path\n- (5,1) is also accessible via LEFT/DOWN moves\n- Both bottom apples are strategically valuable\n\n**Future Mobility Assessment:**\n- UP to (7,6): Opens access to top apples but risks pushing into my own body on future moves\n- DOWN to (7,4): Moves toward the valuable bottom apples while maintaining good mobility\n- LEFT to (6,5): Moves away from the apples but might provide better spacing\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nHead toward the bottom apples (8,1) and (5,1) which are the most accessible. The right side has become congested with my own body, so working downward gives me cleaner paths. Snake #0 seems focused on the left side, so moving down/right to secure (8,1) first seems optimal.\n\n**Best choice is DOWN** - it moves directly toward the closest apple (8,1) while keeping multiple safe options open for next turn.\n\nDOWN",

Snake #1 moved from (7, 5) to (7, 4). This confirms the T35 prediction for Snake #1. Snake #1's tail segment (6, 2) was vacated.

Target $A(8, 1)$.\n$D_1$ to $A(8, 1)$: $|8-7| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4$.\n\nSafe moves for $H_1$:\n1. UP (to 7, 5): **FATAL** (Backwards into neck).\n2. DOWN (to 7, 3): Self-Collision (7, 3 is body segment 9). **FATAL**.\n3. LEFT (to 6, 4): Safe. Moves away from $A(8, 1)$.\n4. RIGHT (to 8, 4): Safe. Moves toward $A(8, 1)$. $N_1$ (8, 4) is body segment 7. Wait, checking the body list: Body: [(7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2)]. The 7th segment *is* (8, 4). Moving RIGHT to (8, 4) is a **Self-Collision**. **FATAL**.\n\nThis leaves only one safe move for $H_1$: **LEFT to (6, 4)**.\n\n*Wait, let me meticulously re-check Snake #1's list and movement.*\n$H_1=(7, 4)$. $N_1=(7, 5)$.\nBody: $B_1 = [(7, 5), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 6), (9, 5), (9, 4), (8, 4), (8, 3), (7, 3), (7, 2), (6, 2)]$.\n*   Move R to (8, 4): This cell is occupied by body segment #7. **FATAL**.\n*   Move D to (7, 3): This cell is occupied by body segment #9. **FATAL**.\n*   Move U to (7, 5): Backwards into $N_1$. **FATAL**.\n\n**Conclusion: Snake #1 has only one safe move: LEFT to (6, 4).** Snake #1 is severely restricted by its own body position.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Safe Moves for ID 0 (Head at 5, 3)\n\nMy plan was to move DOWN to (5, 2), then DOWN to (5, 1) to eat the apple.\n\n**A. Move DOWN to (5, 2)** (Executing 2nd step of plan)\n*   **Safety:** Safe. (5, 2) is currently free.\n*   **Conflict Check:** $H_1$ moves to (6, 4). No head-on collision risk.\n*   **Future (T37):** From (5, 2), DOWN to (5, 1) to eat $A(5, 1)$. This seems secure.\n\n**B. Move RIGHT to (6, 3)** (Alternative/Defense)\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Conflict Check:** $H_1$ moves to (6, 4). No head-on collision risk.\n*   **Impact:** Increases distance to $A(5, 1)$ to 3. (1 LEFT, 2 DOWN).\n*   *Conclusion:* Not optimal, as it delays apple collection unnecessarily.\n\n**C. Move UP to (5, 4)** (Alternative/Defense)\n*   **Safety:** Safe.\n*   **Conflict Check:** $H_1$ moves to (6, 4). No collision.\n*   *Conclusion:* Delays apple collection.\n\nThe path DOWN to (5, 2) is still the fastest route to $A(5, 1)$ and is now highly secure since Snake #1 is moving LEFT toward the middle.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan Update\n\n$H_0$ is at (5, 3). Target $A(5, 1)$. Snake #1 is struggling to move towards $A(8, 1)$.\n1. **T36 (Current):** Move **DOWN** to (5, 2). $H_1$ predicted LEFT to (6, 4). $T_1$ moves to (7, 2).\n2. **T37 (Head at 5, 2):** Move **DOWN** to (5, 1). Capture $A(5, 1)$. $T_0$ moves to (0, 7).\n3. **T38 (Head at 5, 1):** Seek next closest apple. $A(8, 1)$ is D=3 away.\n\nSnake #1 is now facing the center/left side (6, 4), which takes it further from its nearest apples $A(8, 1)$ and $A(5, 1)$. If I collect $A(5, 1)$, Snake #1 might pivot to $A(8, 1)$. I could then potentially intercept or collect that apple next.\n\nThe safest and most efficient choice is DOWN.\n\nDOWN",

(Snake 1's tail moved from (6, 2) to (7, 2) this turn, which is now the new tail segment).

Analysis and Prediction of Enemy Snake #1's Move (Head at 6, 4)\n\n$H_1$ is at (6, 4). $N_1$ is at (7, 4). $T_1$ is at (7, 2).\nNearest apples for #1 are $A(8, 1)$ (D=5) and $A(4, 9)$ (D=5).\n$H_1$ has moved left and is now centralized.\n\nSafe moves for $H_1$ (at 6, 4):\n1. UP (to 6, 5): Safe. Good move towards $A(4, 9)$.\n2. DOWN (to 6, 3): Safe. Good general purpose move.\n3. LEFT (to 5, 4): Safe. Good move towards $A(4, 9)$.\n4. RIGHT (to 7, 4): **FATAL** (Backwards into neck).\n\nSnake #1 has three safe options: UP, DOWN, LEFT.\n\n*   If #1 moves **UP** to (6, 5), it aims for $A(4, 9)$.\n*   If #1 moves **LEFT** to (5, 4), it aims for $A(4, 9)$.\n*   If #1 moves **DOWN** to (6, 3), it aims for $A(8, 1)$ or $A(0, 1)$.\n\nGiven the restriction Snake #1 faced last turn, it is likely seeking open space and efficient movement toward an apple. Both UP and LEFT are good choices for $A(4, 9)$, which is a high-value, less contested apple far from my center of gravity after eating $A(5, 1)$. DOWN is also a strong move to get towards $A(8, 1)$. Let's assume Snake #1 goes for **UP (6, 5)** or **LEFT (5, 4)** as these get it away from the tight corner.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Chosen Move for ID 0\n\nMove: **DOWN to (5, 1)**.\nThis move secures an apple, placing my score at 12, potentially breaking the tie with Snake #1.\n(5, 1) is an open cell, so there is no risk of collision with Snake #1 regardless of its move.\n\n*   $H_0$ goes to (5, 1) (EAT)\n*   $T_0$ remains at (0, 6).\n*   $H_1$ goes to (6, 5) (Prediction: UP) or (5, 4) (Prediction: LEFT) or (6, 3) (Prediction: DOWN).\n*   If $H_1$ moves LEFT to (5, 4), there is one empty space between our heads [(5, 2), (5, 3)]. Safe.\n\nThe move DOWN is mandatory as it achieves the primary objective (eating food) safely.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan Update (T38 onwards)\n\nAfter eating $A(5, 1)$, $H_0$ will be at (5, 1). My tail will still be around (0, 6).\n\nRemaining Apples: (0, 9), (8, 1), (0, 1), (4, 9).\n\n1.  **T38 (Head at 5, 1):** The next closest apple is $A(8, 1)$.\n    *   $D_0$ to $A(8, 1)$: $|8-5| + |1-1| = 3$.\n    *   $D_0$ to $A(4, 9)$: $|4-5| + |9-1| = 9$.\n    *   $D_0$ to $A(0, 1)$: $|0-5| + |1-1| = 5$.\n\n    The target should be $A(8, 1)$.\n    Path to $A(8, 1)$: RIGHT to (6, 1), RIGHT to (7, 1), RIGHT to (8, 1) (EAT).\n    This path is 3 steps.\n\n2.  If Snake #1 moved UP/LEFT towards $A(4, 9)$, I have a clear path to $A(8, 1)$.\n3.  If Snake #1 moved DOWN to (6, 3), it might challenge me for $A(8, 1)$, moving (6, 3) $\\rightarrow$ (6, 2) $\\rightarrow$ (7, 2). *Wait, (7, 2) is currently Snake #1's tail*. Snake #1 will vacate (7, 2) at T38.\n\nLet's proceed by prioritizing $A(8, 1)$ after this move.\n\nDOWN",

Snake #0 is at (5,2), so I need to be cautious about potential collision as we both head toward the bottom-left area.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nI'm now positioned to access the left side of the board. I should move DOWN toward the apple at (5,1) while avoiding snake #0. The enemy snake is currently at (5,2) and likely heading toward (5,1) as well. I need to be strategic about timing to avoid a head-on collision.\n\nDOWN positions me to potentially grab (5,1) while keeping options open. LEFT would also work but puts me further from the immediate apple opportunity.\n\n**Move Selection:**\nDOWN seems optimal as it moves me toward the apple while maintaining flexibility. I can then go LEFT to (5,3) or continue DOWN to (5,1) depending on snake #0's movement.\n\nDOWN",

Analysis and Prediction of Enemy Snake #1's Move (Head at 6, 3)\n\n$H_1$ is at (6, 3). $N_1$ is at (6, 4). $T_1$ is at (7, 3).\nNearest apples for #1 are $A(8, 1)$ (D=4) and $A(4, 9)$ (D=6).\n\nSafe moves for $H_1$ (at 6, 3):\n1. UP (to 6, 4): **FATAL** (Backwards into neck).\n2. DOWN (to 6, 2): Safe. Moves towards $A(8, 1)$.\n3. LEFT (to 5, 3): **Self-Collision** (Body segment (5, 3)). **FATAL**.\n4. RIGHT (to 7, 3): **Self-Collision** (Tail segment (7, 3)). **FATAL if it doesn't move**. Since the tail (7, 3) will be vacated if the snake moves, this is usually safe. Wait, $L_1=12$. If Snake #1 moves, $T_1(7, 3)$ will be vacated, making $R(7, 3)$ safe.\n\nLet's re-examine $H_1$'s collision avoidance:\n*   (6, 4) is Neck. UP is fatal.\n*   (5, 3) is my body segment. LEFT is fatal *if* my snake doesn't move there (which I won't). Wait, (5, 3) is still my body segment. LEFT is **FATAL (Self-Collision with $H_0$'s body)**.\n*   (7, 3) is the enemy tail $T_1$. Since $L_1=12$, if $H_1$ moves, $T_1$ will be vacated. **RIGHT is safe**.\n\nTherefore, Snake #1 has two safe moves: **DOWN (6, 2)** and **RIGHT (7, 3)**.\n\nBoth moves put $H_1$ closer to $A(8, 1)$. Snake #1 is significantly closer than me to this apple if they move $R \\rightarrow (7, 3)$ or $D \\rightarrow (6, 2)$, especially since I have to turn 90 degrees if I go RIGHT now.\n\nIf $H_1$ targets $A(8, 1)$:\n*   Option 1: DOWN (6, 2) $\\rightarrow$ (6, 1) $\\rightarrow$ (7, 1) $\\rightarrow$ (8, 1) (4 steps).\n*   Option 2: RIGHT (7, 3) $\\rightarrow$ (7, 2) $\\rightarrow$ (8, 2) $\\rightarrow$ (8, 1) (4 steps).\n\nIf I target $A(8, 1)$:\n*   Path: RIGHT (6, 1) $\\rightarrow$ (7, 1) $\\rightarrow$ (8, 1) (3 steps). If $H_1$ goes to (6, 2), I beat it by 1 step.\n\n**Prediction:** Snake #1 will move **DOWN to (6, 2)** to minimize risk and advance toward $A(8, 1)$.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Chosen Move for ID 0\n\nMy target is $A(8, 1)$ (3 steps away).\n\nPossible moves for $H_0(5, 1)$: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n1. **RIGHT to (6, 1):** Advances me directly towards $A(8, 1)$.\n    *   If $H_1$ goes DOWN to (6, 2): No collision. My path is clear to (7, 1) next turn. I win the race to $A(8, 1)$.\n    *   If $H_1$ goes RIGHT to (7, 3): No collision. My path is clear. I win the race.\n    *   This is the best move to capture $A(8, 1)$.\n\n2. **LEFT to (4, 1):** Moves towards $A(0, 1)$ (4 steps away). $A(8, 1)$ is closer and more contested. Capturing $A(8, 1)$ is strategically superior right now because it's the high-value contested food.\n\n3. **DOWN to (5, 0):** Moves away from all nearest apples. Only useful if forced to move due to traps, which isn't the case here.\n\n**Move chosen: RIGHT.** This directly aims for $A(8, 1)$, and based on $H_1$'s likely moves, I should arrive one turn ahead of the opponent, extending my lead to 13 apples vs 11.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan Update (T39 onwards)\n\nAfter eating $A(8, 1)$, $H_0$ will be at (8, 1). My tail will still be around (0, 6) or (1, 6).\n\nRemaining Apples: (0, 9), (0, 1), (4, 9), (9, 8).\n\n1.  **T39 (Head at 8, 1 - EAT):** Assuming I eat $A(8, 1)$ at T40.\n    The next closest apple is $A(9, 8)$ (D=8 steps) or $A(4, 9)$ (D=8 steps). $A(0, 1)$ is D=8 steps. They are all roughly equal distance, but $A(9, 8)$ is the easiest to get to without maneuvering around my core body mass, mostly located on the left side of the board.\n\n2.  If Snake #1 missed $A(8, 1)$, it will be positioned nearby, perhaps at (7, 1) or (7, 2). I must use my superior speed in the open to seek a distant apple like $A(9, 8)$ next.\n\nPlan: **RIGHT** $\\rightarrow$ **RIGHT** $\\rightarrow$ **RIGHT** (EAT at $A(8, 1)$). Then, pivot UP towards $A(9, 8)$.\n\nRIGHT",

Potential options from there:\n- LEFT to (5,2) - but snake #0's head is currently at (5,1), so this could lead to collision risk\n- DOWN to (6,1) - opens up access to bottom row apples\n- RIGHT to (7,2) - might be safer but depends on what clears up\n\nI need to be cautious about snake #0's movements since they're ahead and likely aggressive.

I expect to eat it next turn (T40).\n\n### 1. Identify and Eliminate Immediate Fatal Moves for ID 0 (Head at 6, 1)\n\nMy Neck $N_0$ is at (5, 1).\nObstacles include: My Body, Enemy Body, and Walls.\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Collision Check | Status |\n| :--- | :------------ | :--------------- | :----- |\n| UP | (6, 2) | Enemy Head $H_1$. | **FATAL (Head-on collision or collision with $H_1$'s next position)**. |\n| DOWN | (6, 0) | Wall: No. Self: No. Enemy: No. | Safe. |\n| LEFT | (5, 1) | Self-Collision (Neck segment).| **FATAL (Backwards)**. |\n| RIGHT | (7, 1) | Wall: No. Self: No. Enemy: No. | Safe (Towards A(8, 1)). |\n\n**FATAL MOVES:** UP, LEFT.\n**Safe Moves:** DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n*Critical Observation on UP move:* Moving UP leads to (6, 2). This is $H_1$'s current position. Since snakes move simultaneously, if $H_1$ stays at (6, 2) by choosing a move that results in (6, 2) (which is unlikely as they are chasing $A(8, 1)$), or if $H_1$ stands still (which is not an option), it's risky. But more importantly, the intended path RIGHT to (7, 1) is clear, and the intended path DOWN to (6, 0) is also clear. I should not pick UP anyway as it moves away from the target $A(8, 1)$ or leads to a collision.\n\n### 2. Analysis and Prediction of Enemy Snake #1's Move (Head at 6, 2)\n\n$H_1$ is at (6, 2). $N_1$ is at (6, 3). $T_1$ will vacate (8, 3) to (7, 3) if they move.\n\nSafe moves for $H_1$ (at 6, 2):\n1. UP (to 6, 3): **FATAL** (Backwards into neck).\n2. DOWN (to 6, 1): **My Head $H_0$ is here!** If $H_1$ moves DOWN and I move RIGHT to (7, 1), $H_1$ moves into my vacated spot (6, 1). This is safe for both.\n3. LEFT (to 5, 2): **Self-Collision** (My body segment (5, 2)). **FATAL for $H_1$**.\n4. RIGHT (to 7, 2): Safe. Advances toward $A(8, 1)$.\n\n$H_1$ only has two safe, non-suicidal moves: **DOWN (6, 1)** and **RIGHT (7, 2)**.\n\nSince $A(8, 1)$ is the target, RIGHT (7, 2) seems best for $H_1$:\n*   Path: RIGHT (7, 2) $\\rightarrow$ (8, 2) $\\rightarrow$ (8, 1) (3 steps).\n\nIf $H_1$ chooses DOWN (6, 1), they stall the race:\n*   Path: DOWN (6, 1) $\\rightarrow$ (6, 0) $\\rightarrow$ (7, 0) $\\rightarrow$ (8, 0) $\\rightarrow$ (8, 1) (5 steps).\n\n**Prediction for $H_1$:** $H_1$ will choose **RIGHT to (7, 2)** to try and catch up.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Chosen Move for ID 0\n\nMy target is $A(8, 1)$ (2 steps away).\n\n1. **RIGHT to (7, 1):**\n    *   If $H_1$ moves RIGHT to (7, 2): We are still 1 square apart. I am on track to eat $A(8, 1)$ at T40. This is the optimal move.\n    *   If $H_1$ moves DOWN to (6, 1): I vacate (6, 1). $H_1$ takes (6, 1). I go to (7, 1). Clear path for both. I eat $A(8, 1)$ at T40. This is the optimal move.\n    *   If $H_1$ somehow goes UP or LEFT: $H_1$ dies. I win the apple and gain a significant advantage.\n\n2. **DOWN to (6, 0):** This is a safe retreat but gives $H_1$ a free chance to take $A(8, 1)$. If $H_1$ moves RIGHT to (7, 2), they are 2 steps away vs my 3 steps (if I go DOWN then immediately UP to (7, 0) $\\rightarrow$ (8, 0) $\\rightarrow$ (8, 1)). This is a bad option.\n\n**Move chosen: RIGHT.** This commits to capturing the highly contested apple $A(8, 1)$ in two moves (including this one), maintaining my lead in the race.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan Update (T40 onwards)\n\n**T40 (EAT - Head at 8, 1):** I should successfully collect $A(8, 1)$. My new length $L_0=14$. My head will be at (8, 1). $H_1$ will likely be at (7, 2).\n\nRemaining Apples: (0, 9), (0, 1), (4, 9), (9, 8).\n\nThe next closest apple is $A(9, 8)$. Distance from (8, 1) is 1 (Right) + 7 (Up) = 8 steps.\n$A(4, 9)$ is Distance 4 (Left) + 8 (Up) = 12 steps.\n$A(0, 1)$ is Distance 8 (Left) + 0 (Up) = 8 steps.\n\nIf $H_1$ is at (7, 2) at T40, they will likely turn and chase the food I just ate (which will have moved), or target $A(9, 8)$ (Distance 1 right + 6 up = 7 steps) or $A(0, 1)$ (Distance 7 left + 1 down = 8 steps).\n\nSince $A(9, 8)$ is slightly closer to $H_1$, and I am already near the right edge:\nPlan after T40: UP $\\rightarrow$ UP $\\rightarrow$ UP... towards $A(9, 8)$. I must ensure I don't run into $H_1$'s body if they head down and collect $A(0, 1)$. But since I will be at (8, 1) and my body stretches across (6, 1), (5, 1)... (0, 5), the path is clear to (8, 2) $\\rightarrow$ (8, 3) $\\rightarrow$ (8, 4) $\\rightarrow$ (9, 4) $\\rightarrow$ (9, 8).\n\nRIGHT",

This is much better than last turn. Snake #0's head is at (6,1) - this is important because DOWN would put me at (6,1), which is where snake #0's head currently is. However, since we move simultaneously, I need to consider where snake #0 might move.\n\n**Head-on Collision Risk:**\nIf snake #0 moves DOWN to (6,0) and I move DOWN to (6,1), we're fine.\nIf snake #0 moves LEFT to (5,1) and I move DOWN to (6,1), we're fine.\nIf snake #0 moves RIGHT to (7,1) and I move DOWN to (6,1), we're fine.\nIf snake #0 moves UP to (6,2) and I move DOWN to (6,1), we're fine.\n\nThe only dangerous scenario is if snake #0 also moves DOWN to (6,1) - that would cause a head-on collision and both of us die. Given that snake #0 is tied with me and likely wants to avoid dying, they might avoid moving into my potential path.\n\n**Apple Access:**\n- DOWN to (6,1): Puts me near apple at (0,1) but far from others\n- LEFT to (5,2): Moves me toward center, good positioning\n- RIGHT to (7,2): Opens up access to right-side apples at (8,1) and (9,8)\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nSince I'm now tied with snake #0, I should play cautiously. RIGHT seems safest as it moves me away from snake #0's current position and toward less contested apples. LEFT puts me closer to snake #0's body segments.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**\nFrom (7,2), I'll have good access to apples at (8,1) and can potentially work my way toward (4,9) and (0,9).

I should eat it this turn.\n\n### 1. Identify and Eliminate Immediate Fatal Moves for ID 0 (Head at 7, 1)\n\nMy Neck $N_0$ is at (6, 1).\nObstacles include: My Body, Enemy Body, and Walls.\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Collision Check | Status | Rationale |\n| :--- | :------------ | :--------------- | :----- | :-------- |\n| UP | (7, 2) | Enemy Head $H_1$. | **FATAL** | Head-on collision or collision with $H_1$'s next position. |\n| DOWN | (7, 0) | Wall. | Safe. | Off-target, but safe. |\n| LEFT | (6, 1) | Self-Collision (Neck segment).| **FATAL** | Backwards move. |\n| RIGHT | (8, 1) | Apple. | Safe/Goal | Target Apple $A(8, 1)$. |\n\n**FATAL MOVES:** UP, LEFT.\n**Safe Moves:** DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n*Note on UP:* Moving UP to (7, 2) is the exact current location of $H_1$. This results in a head-to-head collision if $H_1$ moves DOWN to (7, 1) or moves LEFT to (6, 2). If $H_1$ moves RIGHT, then I hit $H_1$'s new body. If $H_1$ moves UP, we swap spaces and I hit nothing. However, since the goal is RIGHT, UP is unnecessary and highly risky. We eliminate it.\n\n### 2. Analysis and Prediction of Enemy Snake #1's Move (Head at 7, 2)\n\n$H_1$ is at (7, 2). $N_1$ is at (6, 2). $T_1$ will vacate (8, 4) if they don't eat.\n\n$H_1$ is 2 steps away from $A(8, 1)$. $H_1$ should recognize I am likely eating the apple this turn. $H_1$ might attempt to block me with a risky move, or pivot to the next closest food.\n\nSafe moves for $H_1$ (at 7, 2):\n1. UP (to 7, 3): Hitting $N_1$'s neck is $H_1$'s **(6, 2)**: **(7, 3)** is part of my body map: **(7, 3)** is empty. Safe. Advances away from $A(8, 1)$.\n2. DOWN (to 7, 1): **My Head $H_0$ is here!** If I move RIGHT to (8, 1) (eat apple), and $H_1$ moves DOWN to (7, 1), we are both safe. $H_1$ takes my old spot.\n3. LEFT (to 6, 2): **FATAL** (Backwards into neck).\n4. RIGHT (to 8, 2): Safe. Puts $H_1$ 1 step away from $A(8, 1)$.\n\nIf $H_1$ moves RIGHT to (8, 2), and I move RIGHT to (8, 1) (eating apple), $H_1$ is still safe but misses the apple.\nIf $H_1$ moves DOWN to (7, 1), and I move RIGHT to (8, 1), $H_1$ is safe.\n\nSince I am certain to eat $A(8, 1)$ if I move RIGHT, $H_1$'s optimal move is either to safely follow me (DOWN), or immediately re-target the next food, $A(9, 8)$ (UP, then RIGHT) or $A(0, 1)$ (DOWN, then LEFT).\n\n**Prediction for $H_1$:** $H_1$ will either move **RIGHT to (8, 2)** to minimize distance to where the food will reappear, or **DOWN to (7, 1)** to take my space and prepare for a pivot. It is possible $H_1$ attempts to interfere, but since $A(8, 1)$ is on the coordinate (8, 1) and my current position is (7, 1), blocking is impossible without killing themselves.\n\n### 3. Evaluate Chosen Move for ID 0\n\n**Move chosen: RIGHT to (8, 1).**\n\nThis is an unambiguous apple consumption move, increasing my score to 13 and my length to 14.\n\n*   If $H_1$ moves RIGHT to (8, 2): I eat at (8, 1). $H_1$ is safe.\n*   If $H_1$ moves DOWN to (7, 1): I eat at (8, 1). $H_1$ is safe in my old spot.\n*   If $H_1$ moves UP to (7, 3): I eat at (8, 1). $H_1$ is safe.\n\nThis move is 100% safe and strategically required.\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan Update (T41 onwards)\n\n**T41 (Post-Eat - Head at 8, 1, Length 14):**\nI have just grown. Potential next apples are $A(9, 8)$, $A(4, 9)$, $A(0, 9)$, $A(0, 1)$.\nSince $A(8, 1)$ was eaten, a new apple will spawn, ideally far away from $H_1$.\n\n$H_1$ is likely at (7, 1) or (8, 2).\n\n1.  **Target $A(9, 8)$:** This is the closest remaining peripheral apple to the right half of the board. Distance from (8, 1) is $1+7=8$ steps.\n2.  **Target $A(0, 1)$:** Distance from (8, 1) is $8+0=8$ steps.\n\nSince I am already positioned on the right side, I should head UP towards $A(9, 8)$.\n\n**Plan T41:** Move UP to (8, 2). This avoids potential collision with $H_1$ who might be at (8, 2) or (7, 2). If $H_1$ is at (7, 1) and moves RIGHT to (8, 1) (to chase the new food slot), my UP move is safe. If $H_1$ is at (8, 2) and moves RIGHT to (9, 2), I move UP to (8, 2) safely.\n\n*T41 Move sequence:* UP $\\rightarrow$ UP $\\rightarrow$ RIGHT/UP to reach the top right wall towards $A(9, 8)$.\n\nRIGHT",

From (7,3), I can access apples at (4,9) and (0,9) while maintaining flexibility.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY NOTE:**\nSnake #0 is very close and we're neck-and-neck on apples. Avoid direct confrontation - prioritize survival first. Work toward the apples on the top row (4,9) and (0,9) while keeping distance from snake #0. They'll likely go for (8,1) apple, so let them have it and focus on safer territory.\n\nUP",

Targets $A(0, 1)$ eventually, but this path is long and low.\n\nComparing UP vs. RIGHT:\nBoth moves lead to $A(9, 8)$, which is the furthest apple away from the main congestion zone on the left/center of the board.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (9, 1)**:\n*   Next turn ($T=42$), I am at (9, 1). $H_1$ is at (8, 3).\n*   I can move UP to (9, 2), safely continuing to hug the right wall toward $A(9, 8)$.\n\nIf I move **UP to (8, 2)**:\n*   Next turn ($T=42$), I am at (8, 2). $H_1$ is at (8, 3).\n*   We will be neck-and-neck, with $H_1$ currently being ahead of me. If I try to move UP to (8, 3), I will hit $H_1$. I would be forced to move RIGHT to (9, 2) or LEFT to (7, 2) (which currently has $N_1$). This creates more immediate conflicts.\n\nThe move **RIGHT to (9, 1)** secures the path along the eastern wall toward $A(9, 8)$ while minimizing close quarter interaction with $H_1$, who seems focused on moving up the center: $H_1$ targets $A(7, 6)$ or $A(9, 8)$ (RIGHT to 8, 3 is a good intermediate step for both).\n\n### 4. Long-Term Plan Update (T42 onwards)\n\n**T41 Move selected: RIGHT (to 9, 1).**\n$H_1$ moves RIGHT (to 8, 3).\n\n**T42 Plan (Head at 9, 1, Length 14):**\nI am positioned at the right edge $X=9$, below $A(9, 8)$.\n$H_1$ is at (8, 3).\nNext move should be **UP to (9, 2)** to continue along the wall and maintain distance from $H_1$.\n\n**T43 Plan (Head at 9, 2):**\nContinue **UP** the wall toward $A(9, 8)$.\n\nThe priority is $A(9, 8)$ because $H_1$ might also go for $A(7, 6)$, and $A(9, 8)$ is an isolated target on the wall. Securing this corner apple is crucial while $H_1$ is in the dense body labyrinth.\n\nRIGHT",

Based on the last move's rationale, I successfully moved RIGHT and am now positioned along the right wall, targeting the apple at (9, 8).\n\n**Current Board State/Key Positions:**\n*   My Head $H_0$: (9, 1). My Neck $N_0$: (8, 1). My Length $L_0$: 14 segments (I ate an apple last turn T41). My tail $T_0$ is now at (0, 3) and will vacate (1, 3) this turn.\n*   Enemy Head $H_1$: (8, 3). Enemy Neck $N_1$: (7, 3). Enemy Length $L_1$: 12 segments. $H_1$ moved RIGHT from (7, 3) to (8, 3) as predicted in the last rationale.\n*   Apples $A$: (0, 9), (0, 1), (4, 9), (9, 8), (7, 6).\n\n### 1. Identify and Eliminate Immediate Fatal Moves for ID 0 (Head at 9, 1)\n\nMy position (9, 1) is on the right edge.\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Contents / Collision | Status | Rationale |\n| :--- | :------------ | :--------------- | :----- | :-------- |\n| UP | (9, 2) | Empty. | Safe. | Proceeds along the wall toward $A(9, 8)$. |\n| DOWN | (9, 0) | Empty. | Safe. | Retreat/Diversion. |\n| LEFT | (8, 1) | Self-Collision (Neck segment $N_0$).| **FATAL** | Moving backwards. |\n| RIGHT | (10, 1) | Wall Collision (X > 9).| **FATAL** | Off board. |\n\n**FATAL MOVES:** LEFT, RIGHT.\n**Safe Moves:** UP, DOWN.\n\n### 2. Analysis and Prediction of Enemy Snake #1's Move (Head at 8, 3)\n\n$H_1$ is at (8, 3). $N_1$ is at (7, 3). $T_1$ will vacate (9, 5).\n\n$H_1$'s nearest apples: $A(7, 6)$ distance $1+3=4$ steps, and $A(9, 8)$ distance $1+5=6$ steps.\n\nSafe moves for $H_1$ from (8, 3):\n1. UP (to 8, 4): Safe. Leads toward $A(7, 6)$ and $A(9, 8)$.\n2. DOWN (to 8, 2): Safe. Leads toward me (9, 1).\n3. LEFT (to 7, 3): **FATAL** (Backwards into neck $N_1$).\n4. RIGHT (to 9, 3): Safe. Follows the path toward $A(9, 8)$.\n\n$H_1$ is in a highly competitive area. Given the proximity and importance of $A(7, 6)$ and $A(9, 8)$, $H_1$ is likely to move:\n\n*   **Priority 1: UP to (8, 4).** This is a direct path step toward $A(7, 6)$ (3 steps away).\n*   **Priority 2: RIGHT to (9, 3).** This is a direct path step toward $A(9, 8)$ (5 steps away).\n\nI will assume $H_1$ prioritizes the path that maximizes future mobility and minimizes direct conflict, which likely means attempting to reach $A(7, 6)$ first or maintaining separation. **Prediction: $H_1$ moves UP to (8, 4).**\n\n### 3. Evaluate Safe Moves for ID 0 (Head at 9, 1)\n\nMy goal is $A(9, 8)$.\n\n**1. Move UP to (9, 2):**\n*   This is the natural path along the wall toward $A(9, 8)$.\n*   If $H_1$ chooses UP to (8, 4), we remain separated by one column, and I maintain the advantage on the $X=9$ path. $H_1$ will likely continue toward $A(7, 6)$, giving me clear access to $A(9, 8)$.\n*   If $H_1$ chooses RIGHT to (9, 3), $H_1$ is still ahead of me at (9, 3). I would be at (9, 2). Still safe, but $H_1$ claims the wall path. However, $A(9, 8)$ is 5 steps away for $H_1$ from (9, 3) and 6 steps away for me from (9, 2). $H_1$ would get the apple first. Given $H_1$ is only 12 segments long, $H_1$ may take the risk on the wall. *This is a minor risk.*\n*   If $H_1$ chooses DOWN to (8, 2): I move UP and avoid any immediate head conflict.\n\n**2. Move DOWN to (9, 0):**\n*   This is a defensive retreat. It allows $H_1$ to claim the upper right quadrant entirely, forcing me to backtrack severely for $A(9, 8)$.\n*   It might open access to $A(0, 1)$ or $A(0, 9)$ eventually, but requires long pathfinding around my own long body segments.\n\nThe move **UP to (9, 2)** is the high-reward, preferred option. It directly pursues $A(9, 8)$.\n\n### 4. Check for Head-on Collision Risks (ID 0 UP to 9, 2)\n\nA collision occurs only if $H_1$ moves to (9, 2) at the same time I move to (9, 2).\n\n*   $H_1$ starts at (8, 3).\n*   To reach (9, 2), $H_1$ would need to move RIGHT from (8, 3) to (9, 3), and then DOWN from (9, 3) to (9, 2). This requires two diagonal steps or one non-cardinal move, which is impossible in one turn.\n*   Therefore, moving UP to (9, 2) is safe against a head-on collision.\n\n### 5. Final Decision\n\nPursuing $A(9, 8)$ using the $X=9$ wall path is the safest and most efficient short-term objective.\n\n**T42 Move selected: UP (to 9, 2).**\n$H_1$ is predicted to move UP to (8, 4) or RIGHT to (9, 3).\n\n**T43 Plan (My Head at 9, 2):**\nIf $H_1$ moved UP to (8, 4), continue **UP to (9, 3)** toward $A(9, 8)$. This continues the $X=9$ path.\nIf $H_1$ moved RIGHT to (9, 3), the path to $A(9, 8)$ is contested. I would then move LEFT to (8, 2) to fight for the center-right or shift goal to $A(7, 6)$, or continue UP to (9, 3) risking a future trap. Given the length of the snake, maintaining the perimeter is generally safer.\n\nI choose UP.\n\nUP",

I must pivot toward the other large apples: $A(7, 6)$, or perhaps the distant $A(4, 9)$ or $A(0, Y)$ apples, navigating through my own long body.\n\nMoving LEFT to (8, 2) is the only option, allowing me to regroup.\n\n***\n**T43 Move selected: LEFT (to 8, 2).**\n$H_1$ is guaranteed to move UP to (9, 4).\n\n**T44 Plan (My Head at 8, 2):**\nIf $H_1$ continues UP to (9, 5) toward $A(9, 8)$, I will be at (8, 2).\nMy next targets depend on how $H_1$ moves relative to $A(7, 6)$.\nFrom (8, 2), I could move:\n1. UP to (8, 3) (Safe, as $H_1$'s neck section at (8, 3) will vacate). This puts me adjacent to $H_1$'s likely path, but also closer to $A(7, 6)$.\n2. LEFT to (7, 2) (Safe). This is also a good path toward $A(7, 6)$.\n\nI will favor moving UP to (8, 3) on T44 if it remains safe, as it keeps me near the action and prevents $H_1$ from using that column width for maneuvering.\n\nLEFT",

Evaluate Safe Moves for ID 0 (Head at 8, 2)\n\nI have two safe moves: UP (to 8, 3) and LEFT (to 7, 2). Both lead toward the center of the board and potential apples $A(4, 9)$ or $A(7, 6)$.\n\n**Goal:** Capture $A(7, 6)$ without getting trapped.\n\n**A) Move UP to (8, 3):**\n*   This puts me closer to the vacated spot of $H_1$'s old segment (8, 5) and generally forces me toward the right side.\n*   Distance to $A(7, 6)$: Manhattan distance 4 steps (e.g., 8,3 -> 7,3 -> 7,4 -> 7,5 -> 7,6).\n*   If $H_1$ moves UP to (9, 5), the cell (8, 4) remains empty on T45.\n*   The segment $H_1$ vacated, (9, 3), is far from me.\n*   (8, 3) is clear.\n\n**B) Move LEFT to (7, 2):**\n*   This moves me adjacent to my long horizontal body segment (7, 1).\n*   Distance to $A(7, 6)$: Manhattan distance 4 steps (e.g., 7,2 -> 7,3 -> 7,4 -> 7,5 -> 7,6).\n*   This path seems slightly safer as it moves me away from $H_1$.\n\nComparing the paths to $A(7, 6)$:\n*   **Path A (via 8, 3):** 8,2 -> 8,3 -> 7,3 -> 7,4 -> 7,5 -> 7,6.\n*   **Path B (via 7, 2):** 8,2 -> 7,2 -> 7,3 -> 7,4 -> 7,5 -> 7,6.\n\nBoth paths have similar distances to $A(7, 6)$.\n\nLet's look at potential immediate conflict:\nIf I choose UP to (8, 3), I am one square away from a potential $H_1$ turn (if $H_1$ moves LEFT to (8, 4)).\nIf I choose LEFT to (7, 2), I am separated by two columns from $H_1$'s likely path (X=9).\n\nIf $H_1$ is playing defensively/aggressively:\n*   $H_1$ could move LEFT to (8, 4). This would put $H_1$ in my way if I choose UP to (8, 3) on the next turn (T45).\n*   If $H_1$ moves LEFT to (8, 4) and I move UP to (8, 3), we are adjacent, but not threatening collision.\n\nSince $H_1$ is currently ahead in the race to $A(9, 8)$, I should focus on maximizing my lead by getting $A(7, 6)$. Moving LEFT (7, 2) seems to provide more breathing room from $H_1$'s movements on the right border.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (7, 2):\nOn T45, I will be at (7, 2). I can then move UP to (7, 3), which is a clear segment of the path to $A(7, 6)$.\n\n*Decision: Move LEFT to increase separation from $H_1$ and maintain an easy path toward $A(7, 6)$.*\n\n***\n**T45 Plan (My Head at 7, 2, assuming H1 moves to 9, 5):**\nFrom (7, 2), the next move would definitely be UP to (7, 3) to continue toward $A(7, 6)$. $H_1$ will be far away.\n\nLEFT",
