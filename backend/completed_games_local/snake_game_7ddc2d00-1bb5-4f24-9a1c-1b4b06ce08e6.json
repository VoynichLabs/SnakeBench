Off-board: none for these three moves.  \n2. Into own body: DOWN is only one.  \n3. Into enemy body: enemy body at (6,8), (5,8), (4,8) \u2013 none of my safe moves go there.  \n4. Head-on collision: enemy head at (6,7).  \n   - Enemy possible moves from (6,7): UP to (6,8) \u2013 its own body, illegal. DOWN to (6,6) \u2013 empty. LEFT to (5,7) \u2013 empty. RIGHT to (7,7) \u2013 empty.  \n   - Could enemy move to (8,3) same turn as me? From (6,7) to (8,3) requires 2 steps in one turn, impossible. So no head-on collision risk at (8,3) this turn.  \n   - Could enemy move to (7,2)? From (6,7) to (7,2) is 5 steps, impossible.  \n   - Could enemy move to (9,2)? From (6,7) to (9,2) is 4 steps, impossible.  \n\nSo all three safe moves avoid head-on collision this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Future safety considerations:**  \n- **UP to (8,3)**: eat apple, grow to length 3. Next turn my body will be at [(8,3), (8,2), (8,1)]? Wait: after eating apple, new head at (8,3), tail stays? Actually in Snake, when you eat apple, you grow by 1 segment at the end of the move, so next turn body length = 3: head at (8,3), then (8,2), then (8,1). That means next turn from (8,3), DOWN to (8,2) is my own body, so not safe. But UP, LEFT, RIGHT might be safe depending on board.  \n- **LEFT to (7,2)**: no apple, length stays 2. Next turn body: head at (7,2), then (8,2), then (8,1)? Wait, current body is (8,2) and (8,1). If I move to (7,2), new head (7,2), body becomes [(7,2), (8,2), (8,1)]? No, length is 2, so tail moves: body becomes [(7,2), (8,2)], (8,1) disappears. So next turn from (7,2), possible moves: UP to (7,3), DOWN to (7,1), LEFT to (6,2), RIGHT to (8,2) \u2013 but (8,2) will be my body then. So 3 safe moves.  \n- **RIGHT to (9,2)**: no apple, length 2. Next turn body: [(9,2), (8,2)], (8,1) disappears. From (9,2), moves: UP to (9,3), DOWN to (9,1), LEFT to (8,2) \u2013 body, so illegal, RIGHT off-board. So only 2 safe moves next turn.\n\n---\n\n**Enemy threat:**  \nEnemy at (6,7) is far, not an immediate threat to my possible moves. It might go for apple at (4,7) or (5,9) or (2,7).  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP gets me an apple, increasing my score to 2, and grows my length, which is good for survival (longer snakes can block enemies in future).  \nRisk: after eating, my body occupies (8,2) and (8,1), so from (8,3) next turn DOWN is blocked, but I still have UP, LEFT, RIGHT likely safe unless enemy moves there.  \n\nLEFT and RIGHT don't get apple, keep me short, which is less advantageous long-term.  \n\nGiven the board, UP seems best: immediate reward, safe this turn, and next turn I can likely go LEFT or RIGHT from (8,3) to avoid trapping myself.\n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (8,3) after eating apple, check if UP to (8,4) is safe (empty now), LEFT to (7,3) (empty now), RIGHT to (9,3) (empty now). Likely move LEFT or RIGHT to avoid going up against top wall too soon. Keep an eye on enemy #0's position.\n\nUP",

So 3 safe moves next turn.  \n- **LEFT to (7, 3)**: no apple, length 3. Next turn body: head (7, 3), then (8, 3), then (8, 2). From (7, 3), safe moves: UP (7,4), DOWN (7,2), LEFT (6,3), RIGHT (8,3) \u2013 body, so illegal. So 3 safe moves.  \n- **RIGHT to (9, 3)**: no apple, length 3. Next turn body: head (9, 3), then (8, 3), then (8, 2). From (9, 3), safe moves: UP (9,4) \u2013 apple, DOWN (9,2), LEFT (8,3) \u2013 body, illegal, RIGHT off-board. So only 2 safe moves next turn (UP, DOWN).  \n\nRIGHT leads to fewer options next turn (edge of board).  \n\n---\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nClosest apple (9,4) can be reached in 2 steps: either UP then RIGHT, or RIGHT then UP.  \nIf I go UP now to (8,4), next turn I can go RIGHT to (9,4) to eat apple.  \nIf I go RIGHT now to (9,3), next turn I can go UP to (9,4) to eat apple.  \nBut RIGHT now reduces future moves more.  \n\nEnemy is at (5,7) and might go for (4,7) apple this turn, not (9,4). So (9,4) likely safe for me to get in 2 turns.\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nGrow safely. Avoid trapping myself near walls. Keep distance from enemy until longer.  \nFrom (8,4) next turn, I can go LEFT or RIGHT to open space, or UP to (8,5) then eventually to (5,9) apple.  \n\nUP now gives more options and sets up for (9,4) apple next turn.  \n\nLEFT now is also safe but moves away from nearest apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nUP is safe, keeps options open, and positions me to get (9,4) apple next turn while avoiding wall constraints.  \n\nUP",

Head-on collision: enemy head at (4, 7).  \n   - Enemy possible moves from (4, 7):  \n     - UP to (4, 8) \u2013 empty.  \n     - DOWN to (4, 6) \u2013 empty.  \n     - LEFT to (3, 7) \u2013 empty.  \n     - RIGHT to (5, 7) \u2013 its own body, illegal.  \n   So enemy can go UP, DOWN, LEFT.  \n   Could enemy move to (8, 5), (7, 4), or (9, 4) this turn? No, all are \u2265 3 steps away.  \n   So no head-on collision risk this turn.\n\n---\n\n**Future safety considerations:**  \n- **RIGHT to (9, 4)**: eat apple, grow to length 4. Next turn body: head (9, 4), then (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2). Tail (8, 1) disappears. From (9, 4), safe moves next turn: UP (9,5), DOWN (9,3), LEFT (8,4) \u2013 body, so illegal. So only 2 safe moves (UP, DOWN), and on right edge.  \n- **UP to (8, 5)**: no apple, length stays 3. Next turn body: head (8, 5), then (8, 4), (8, 3). Tail (8, 2) disappears. From (8, 5), safe moves: UP (8,6), DOWN (8,4) \u2013 body, illegal, LEFT (7,5), RIGHT (9,5). So 3 safe moves.  \n- **LEFT to (7, 4)**: no apple, length 3. Next turn body: head (7, 4), then (8, 4), (8, 3). From (7, 4), safe moves: UP (7,5), DOWN (7,3), LEFT (6,4), RIGHT (8,4) \u2013 body, illegal. So 3 safe moves.\n\nRIGHT gives immediate apple but puts me on edge with fewer options next turn.  \nUP or LEFT keep more options open but delay apple.\n\n---\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \n(9,4) is very close. If I go RIGHT now, I eat it and grow, but then I'm at (9,4) with only UP/DOWN next turn. That's risky if enemy approaches later.  \nIf I go UP now, I can still get (9,4) next turn by going RIGHT from (8,5) \u2014 but then I'd be at (9,4) with same edge problem, just one turn later.  \nIf I go LEFT now, I move away from (9,4) but toward center and other apples like (4,4), (5,3).\n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEnemy is longer (5 vs my 3). Avoid direct confrontation. Grow safely.  \nGoing RIGHT for apple now gives growth but traps me on right edge. Could be okay if I plan to go UP immediately next turn to (9,5) and then left across top.  \nBut (9,5) is empty now, and (5,9) apple is up there.  \n\nActually, if I go RIGHT \u2192 eat apple \u2192 next turn UP to (9,5) \u2192 then LEFT to (8,5) etc., I can escape edge. That\u2019s workable.\n\nLEFT or UP are safer for future flexibility but delay growth. With enemy at 4 apples already, I need to catch up.\n\n---\n\n**Decision:**  \nRIGHT gets apple, grows to 4, and while it limits next turn\u2019s moves, I can plan to go UP immediately next turn to regain space. The growth is worth the slight risk because enemy is ahead in apples.\n\nRIGHT",

No immediate collision risk this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Consider each safe move:**  \n\n**RIGHT to (7, 2)** \u2013 eat apple, grow to length 8.

So 3 safe moves, no immediate apple adjacent.  \n\n**UP to (6, 3)** \u2013 no apple.

RIGHT is low risk and gains an apple.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nEat (7, 2) apple now, then consider moving up toward (5, 3) or (6, 8) later while avoiding trapping myself.

So 3 safe moves, no apple adjacent.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan:**  \nI need to catch up in apples (7 vs 11). The nearest apple is (5, 3). To get there, I should move UP now to (7, 3), then next turn possibly LEFT to (6, 3) (adjacent to (5, 3) apple). That path seems safe and purposeful.  \nRIGHT or DOWN just wander without clear apple targeting.  \n\nUP gives same number of safe next moves as others but positions me better for (5, 3).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan for next turn:**  \nFrom (7, 3), consider moving LEFT to (6, 3) to set up for (5, 3) apple, unless enemy blocks. Keep checking enemy\u2019s position to avoid head-on collisions.  \n\nUP",

LEFT keeps momentum on the southern cluster and preserves multiple escape options (UP or LEFT next turn).\n- No self-collision risk from moving LEFT and no likely head-on collision this turn.\n\nShort-term plan (next few turns):\n- Take (1,0) now, then take (0,0) and (1,1)/(0,2) as they are reachable, clearing the lower-left apple cluster.\n- After clearing, reassess and either sweep up column 0/1 toward the apples at (0,2),(0,4),(1,3),(1,5) or open eastward if the enemy moves into the center area.\n- Avoid getting boxed into my own body along column 2; prefer routes that keep at least two exit choices each turn.\n\nLEFT",

Keeping multiple exits reduces the risk of getting boxed by my own long body along x=1/2.\n- Enemy is far to the east and has nearby apples to collect; a head-on collision is unlikely this turn.\n\nShort plan (next few turns):\n- Move LEFT to (0,4) now and then choose between UP (0,5) or DOWN (0,3) based on enemy movement. Aim to collect the nearby apples on the x=0 column (0,2 and 0,0) while avoiding getting trapped along the left wall \u2014 prefer routes that keep at least one open column to my right to retreat into (via 1,x or 2,x) when safe.\n\nLEFT",

After that move, every adjacent cell to the new head would be occupied by my own body ((1,6),(2,5),(1,4), and (0,5) would all be part of my body), leaving no legal escape on the next turn and effectively causing a guaranteed death. That makes RIGHT a suicide move despite the immediate apple.\n\nWhy UP is best:\n- UP to (0,6) is safe now and leaves at least one clear follow-up (0,7) and access to apples at (0,8)/(0,9). It keeps multiple exits open and avoids getting boxed into my own body.\n- Enemy head is far and not an immediate threat to that column.\n\nShort plan for next turns:\n- Continue up the x=0 column to collect (0,8)/(0,9) and maintain open space. Only move right into x=1 when it is actually free (not immediately into a cell surrounded by my own body). Avoid tight traps along x=1/x=2 where my body already occupies many cells.\n\nUP",

RIGHT delays eating by one turn but still leads to apple at (8,9) next turn if we go RIGHT again. However, enemy is far and not threatening, so immediate apple grab is good.  \n\nLEFT",

Enemy head at (6,9) is far and not an immediate threat. Avoid moving right into my own crowded body until I have more space.\n\nShort plan:\n- Continue up to collect (0,8) and (0,9). After securing those, reassess to either snake back down the left column to pick (0,2)/(0,0) or find a safe route into the middle once my tail frees space. Never move into a cell that would leave me with zero follow-up moves (avoid self-entrapment).\n\nUP",

So next turn (1,9) will be enemy body segment (since enemy grows if it eats apple? Let\u2019s check: enemy at (0,9) \u2192 (1,9) has no apple, so enemy does not grow, so (1,9) will be enemy head now, but next turn enemy will move away from (1,9) leaving body? Wait, careful:  \n\nThis turn:  \nEnemy moves RIGHT from (0,9) to (1,9) \u2014 no apple at (1,9), so enemy length stays 19, body shifts: new head (1,9), old head (0,9) becomes body, tail (1,7) disappears.  \nSo at end of this turn, enemy body includes (0,9), (0,8), \u2026 etc. (1,9) is head.  \n\nNext turn, if I move LEFT from (2,9) to (1,9), that\u2019s moving into enemy\u2019s current head position? No \u2014 enemy will have moved again by then. But we can\u2019t know enemy\u2019s next move yet. However, (1,9) will be empty next turn unless enemy stays there (unlikely). But possible head-on collision risk if enemy moves back to (2,9) next turn? Let\u2019s check later.  \n\nActually, better to evaluate after eating apple: from (2,9) next turn, possible moves: DOWN (2,8), LEFT (1,9), RIGHT (3,9) \u2014 but (3,9) will be my old head location, which is now body (since I grew), so RIGHT is illegal. So only DOWN and LEFT possibly safe. LEFT (1,9) could be risky if enemy moves there again.  \n\n**DOWN to (3, 8)** \u2013 no apple.  \nNext turn from (3, 8):  \nUP \u2192 (3, 9) \u2192 my body \u2192 illegal  \nDOWN \u2192 (3, 7) \u2192 apple (3,7) present, empty now  \nLEFT \u2192 (2, 8) \u2192 empty  \nRIGHT \u2192 (4, 8) \u2192 empty  \nSo 3 safe moves next turn (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).  \n\n---\n\n**Risk of head-on collision this turn:**  \nEnemy moving to (1, 9).  \nIf I move LEFT to (2, 9), no collision.  \nIf I move DOWN to (3, 8), no collision.  \n\n---\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nLEFT gets apple immediately (2,9).  \nDOWN sets up for (3,7) apple next turn.  \n\nBut need to consider enemy\u2019s position after its move to (1,9). From (1,9) enemy can go UP (off board), DOWN (1,8), LEFT (0,9) its body, RIGHT (2,9) \u2014 if I go LEFT to (2,9) and eat apple, next turn enemy might go RIGHT to (2,9) while I\u2019m still there? No \u2014 I will have moved away from (2,9) next turn unless I stay, but staying is impossible because UP off board, RIGHT body, only DOWN or LEFT. If I go DOWN to (2,8), enemy going RIGHT to (2,9) is fine. So no direct collision next turn likely.  \n\nBut enemy length 19 vs my 13 \u2014 avoid risky closeness.  \n\n---\n\n**Future mobility:**  \nDOWN gives 3 safe moves next turn, LEFT gives 2 safe moves next turn (since RIGHT into body, UP off board).  \nApple gain now vs later: We\u2019re behind 12 vs 19, need apples. Taking (2,9) now is good.  \n\nAlso, board apples at (3,7),(3,6),(3,4) are near my path if I go DOWN after eating (2,9).  \n\n---\n\n**Plan:**  \nTake apple now at (2,9), then next turn go DOWN to (2,8) to avoid possible enemy move to (2,9) and to head toward (3,7) apple.  \n\nLEFT",

Need to check enemy\u2019s possible moves.  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (3, 9) \u2192 my body \u2192 illegal  \n\nSo safe moves without considering enemy movement: only DOWN.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy possible moves from (1, 9):**  \n- UP \u2192 (1, 10) \u2192 off board \u2192 illegal  \n- DOWN \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 empty  \n- LEFT \u2192 (0, 9) \u2192 its own body \u2192 illegal  \n- RIGHT \u2192 (2, 9) \u2192 my head currently \u2192 if enemy moves RIGHT into my head\u2019s current position while I move away, no collision. But if I move LEFT into (1,9) while enemy moves RIGHT into (2,9), we swap positions and no collision.  \n\nBut I cannot move LEFT into (1,9) because that\u2019s enemy\u2019s head now \u2014 moving into enemy\u2019s head this turn causes head-on collision only if enemy stays there or moves into my new head cell. Let\u2019s check:  \n\nIf I move LEFT to (1,9) and enemy moves RIGHT to (2,9): heads go to different cells \u2192 no collision.  \nIf I move LEFT to (1,9) and enemy moves DOWN to (1,8): both heads to (1,9) and (1,8) \u2192 no collision.  \nIf I move LEFT to (1,9) and enemy stays at (1,9) (impossible, enemy must move, only DOWN or RIGHT possible). So enemy cannot stay.  \n\nThus LEFT is *potentially* safe if enemy doesn\u2019t choose to move into (1,9) while I move there \u2014 but enemy can\u2019t move into (1,9) because it starts there. So LEFT means I move into enemy\u2019s starting head position after enemy leaves it. That\u2019s safe unless enemy moves into my new head cell (1,9) from elsewhere, which it can\u2019t.  \n\nWait \u2014 careful: enemy starts at (1,9). If enemy moves RIGHT to (2,9), then (1,9) becomes empty (old head moves, body shifts). If I move LEFT to (1,9), I land in a cell that was enemy\u2019s head at start of turn but is now empty after enemy moves. That\u2019s fine.  \n\nBut what if enemy moves DOWN to (1,8)? Then (1,9) becomes part of enemy\u2019s body (old head becomes body segment). Then if I move LEFT to (1,9), I move into enemy\u2019s body \u2192 I die.  \n\nSo LEFT is safe only if enemy moves RIGHT. If enemy moves DOWN, LEFT kills me.  \n\nSince I don\u2019t know enemy\u2019s move, LEFT is risky.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy\u2019s likely move:**  \nFrom (1,9), DOWN (1,8) is safe and goes toward apple at (1,5) and more open space. RIGHT (2,9) is my current head \u2014 risky for enemy if I stay there (but I won\u2019t stay, I\u2019ll move DOWN or LEFT). If enemy thinks I might stay, RIGHT could cause head-on collision for them, so they might avoid it. But they might risk it if they think I\u2019ll leave.  \n\nGiven enemy length 19 vs my 13, they might play safe and go DOWN to avoid possible collision.  \n\n---\n\n**Thus:**  \n- LEFT: safe if enemy goes RIGHT, fatal if enemy goes DOWN.  \n- DOWN: always safe regardless of enemy move.  \n\nOnly DOWN is guaranteed safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Next turn mobility from (2, 8):**  \nUP \u2192 (2, 9) \u2192 empty (since I moved)  \nDOWN \u2192 (2, 7) \u2192 empty  \nLEFT \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 possibly enemy head if enemy goes DOWN this turn  \nRIGHT \u2192 (3, 8) \u2192 empty  \n\nSo good options unless enemy ends at (1,8).  \n\n---\n\n**Apple targeting:**  \nFrom (2,8), apples at (3,7), (3,6), (3,4) are reachable soon.  \n\n---\n\n**Plan:**  \nGo DOWN to (2,8) to stay safe, then assess next turn. Avoid gambling on enemy\u2019s move when a safe move exists.  \n\nDOWN",

But after I move, my body shifts, so (2, 9) will become my neck (second segment) next turn. However, moving into your own body segment that is still there *this turn* is illegal \u2014 yes, (2, 9) is in my body list now, so UP is suicide. **Illegal**.  \n\n2. **DOWN** \u2192 (2, 7) \u2192 check board: from given board state row 7: (2,7) is empty (\u2019.\u2019). Also not in enemy body list. Safe unless enemy moves there simultaneously.  \n\n3. **LEFT** \u2192 (1, 8) \u2192 enemy head currently there. Moving into enemy head this turn is dangerous:  \n   - If enemy stays there (impossible, must move), collision.  \n   - If enemy moves into my head\u2019s current cell (2, 8) while I move into (1, 8), heads swap \u2192 no collision.  \n   - If enemy moves elsewhere (UP to (1, 9) \u2014 illegal, enemy body there; DOWN to (1, 7) \u2014 empty; RIGHT to (2, 8) \u2014 my current head), then (1, 8) becomes enemy body segment (old head) after they move. If I move LEFT into (1, 8) in that case, I hit enemy body \u2192 die.  \n   So LEFT is safe only if enemy moves RIGHT to (2, 8). If enemy moves DOWN to (1, 7), I die. Risky.  \n\n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (3, 8) \u2192 empty on board, not in my body, not in enemy body. Safe regardless of enemy move.  \n\nSo definitely safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT. Possibly safe: LEFT (if enemy goes RIGHT). UP illegal.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy\u2019s possible moves from (1, 8):**  \n- UP (1, 9) \u2192 enemy\u2019s own body \u2192 illegal.  \n- DOWN (1, 7) \u2192 empty.  \n- LEFT (0, 8) \u2192 enemy\u2019s own body \u2192 illegal.  \n- RIGHT (2, 8) \u2192 my current head.  \n\nSo enemy can only go DOWN or RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Collision analysis:**  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 7) and enemy goes RIGHT to (2, 8): no collision.  \nIf I go DOWN to (2, 7) and enemy goes DOWN to (1, 7): heads are at (2, 7) and (1, 7) \u2192 safe.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 8) and enemy goes RIGHT to (2, 8): safe.  \nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 8) and enemy goes DOWN to (1, 7): safe.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (1, 8) and enemy goes RIGHT to (2, 8): safe (swap).  \nIf I go LEFT to (1, 8) and enemy goes DOWN to (1, 7): I hit enemy\u2019s old head (now body) at (1, 8) \u2192 die.  \n\nSo LEFT is 50/50 depending on enemy\u2019s choice.  \n\n---\n\n**Which is better, DOWN or RIGHT?**  \n\nFrom (2, 7) after DOWN:  \nNext moves: UP back to (2, 8) (possible enemy head if enemy went RIGHT), LEFT (1, 7) (possible enemy head if enemy went DOWN), RIGHT (3, 7) (apple), DOWN (2, 6) (empty).  \nApple at (3, 7) is close.  \n\nFrom (3, 8) after RIGHT:  \nNext moves: UP (3, 9) (my body), DOWN (3, 7) (apple), LEFT (2, 8) (possible enemy head if enemy went RIGHT), RIGHT (4, 8) (empty).  \nAlso can reach apple (3, 7) next turn via DOWN.  \n\nBoth give access to apple (3, 7) next turn.  \n\nBut RIGHT from (3, 8) also opens path to apples at (3, 6), (3, 4), (5, 3) later.  \nFrom (2, 7), path to (3, 7) is immediate but then may be closer to enemy territory (enemy\u2019s long body along left side).  \n\nGiven enemy is longer (19 vs my 13), I should avoid risky head-on possibilities.  \nRIGHT seems slightly safer because:  \n- Enemy\u2019s only safe moves are DOWN or RIGHT.  \n- If enemy goes RIGHT to (2, 8), then my RIGHT to (3, 8) keeps me adjacent but not colliding.  \n- If enemy goes DOWN to (1, 7), then my RIGHT to (3, 8) is far from them.  \n\nDOWN to (2, 7) risks being close if enemy goes DOWN to (1, 7) \u2014 adjacent cells, possible next-turn confrontation.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nFrom (3, 8), consider moving DOWN to (3, 7) to eat apple if safe, but check enemy\u2019s new head position first. Keep moving toward center/apple clusters while avoiding being trapped by enemy\u2019s long body along left/bottom edges.  \n\n---\n\nRIGHT",

Let\u2019s check enemy\u2019s safe moves.  \n4. **RIGHT** \u2192 (4, 5) \u2192 empty, safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Enemy possible moves from (2, 5):**  \nEnemy body: (1, 5) behind head, (2, 4) not in body list (actually (2, 4) is not in body list \u2014 wait, check: enemy body list: (1,5), (1,6), \u2026 (2,3) then ends. So (2,4) is empty, (2,5) is head, (2,6) empty, (3,5) my head, (2,5) head, (1,5) body).  \n\nFrom (2, 5):  \n- UP (2, 6) \u2192 empty  \n- DOWN (2, 4) \u2192 empty  \n- LEFT (1, 5) \u2192 enemy\u2019s own body (second segment) \u2192 illegal  \n- RIGHT (3, 5) \u2192 my head \u2192 possible head-on collision if I go LEFT into (2,5) or if I stay at (3,5) and he goes RIGHT.  \n\nSo enemy safe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.  \n\n---\n\n**Collision risk for my moves:**  \n\nIf I go DOWN to (3, 4):  \nEnemy could go RIGHT to (3, 5) \u2014 not same cell, safe.  \nEnemy could go UP to (2, 6) or DOWN to (2, 4) \u2014 no collision.  \n\nIf I go LEFT to (2, 5):  \nEnemy could go RIGHT to (3, 5) \u2014 I\u2019d be at (2,5), he at (3,5) \u2192 no collision.  \nEnemy could go UP to (2, 6) \u2014 I\u2019d be at (2,5), he at (2,6) \u2192 no collision.  \nEnemy could go DOWN to (2, 4) \u2014 I\u2019d be at (2,5), he at (2,4) \u2192 no collision.  \nActually, LEFT to (2,5) is safe this turn because enemy is currently at (2,5) but will move away simultaneously. However, moving into a cell currently occupied by enemy head is dangerous only if enemy stays there. Enemy cannot stay at (2,5) because LEFT (1,5) is his body, so he must move UP, DOWN, or RIGHT. So LEFT is safe this turn.  \n\nIf I go RIGHT to (4, 5):  \nEnemy could go RIGHT to (3, 5) \u2014 no collision.  \n\nSo all three moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are safe this turn.  \n\n---\n\n**Future moves after each:**  \n\nAfter DOWN to (3, 4) and eat apple \u2192 length 17, body: new tail stays same? Actually, eating apple means tail doesn\u2019t move, so body becomes: head (3,4), then (3,5), (3,6), \u2026 up to (6,4) plus one extra segment at tail end (6,4) duplicated? Wait, growth: new head at (3,4), old head (3,5) becomes segment 2, tail stays at (6,4) and we add a new segment at tail after move? In Snake, when you eat, you grow by 1 at the end after moving, so next turn tail is same as current tail, length+1.  \n\nFrom (3, 4) next turn:  \nUP (3, 5) my body, DOWN (3, 3) empty, LEFT (2, 4) possibly enemy there if enemy went DOWN this turn, RIGHT (4, 4) empty.  \nSo safe moves: DOWN, RIGHT. Possibly LEFT if enemy not there.  \n\nAfter LEFT to (2, 5):  \nFrom (2, 5) next turn:  \nUP (2, 6) empty, DOWN (2, 4) empty, LEFT (1, 5) enemy body, RIGHT (3, 5) my body.  \nSo safe: UP, DOWN \u2014 two options, but (2,5) is risky because enemy could be near.  \n\nAfter RIGHT to (4, 5):  \nFrom (4, 5) next turn:  \nUP (4, 6) empty, DOWN (4, 4) empty, LEFT (3, 5) my body, RIGHT (5, 5) my body.  \nSo safe: UP, DOWN \u2014 two options.  \n\n---\n\n**Strategic choice:**  \nLEFT (2, 5) puts me close to enemy\u2019s long body on left, limiting future space.  \nRIGHT (4, 5) keeps me central but no apple.  \nDOWN (3, 4) eats apple immediately, gains length, and keeps options (DOWN or RIGHT next turn).  \n\nApple at (3, 4) is safe to take because enemy at (2,5) can\u2019t reach it this turn (needs two moves).  \n\nBest is DOWN \u2014 eat apple, grow, stay safe.  \n\n---\n\n**Long-term plan note for next turn:**  \nAfter moving to (3,4) and eating apple, length 17. Next turn from (3,4), consider DOWN to (3,3) or RIGHT to (4,4) depending on enemy position. Enemy head will be at one of (2,6), (2,4), or (3,5). If enemy at (3,5), avoid RIGHT (4,4) is safe anyway. Prefer DOWN to (3,3) to move toward center apples (5,3) etc. Keep expanding toward right side board where more apples are, avoid left side where enemy\u2019s long body blocks.  \n\nDOWN",

Moving into an enemy head cell is allowed if they vacate it this turn; swapping positions is possible and not an immediate head-on unless both move into the same square. From (3,5) I have good follow-ups: RIGHT to (4,5) and DOWN to the apple at (3,4).\n\nSafety and tactical assessment:\n- UP and DOWN are more constraining and risk getting boxed in; DOWN leads directly into a contested apple with limited escape routes.\n- RIGHT gives the most safe follow-up options (two sensible forward moves) and positions me toward the central apple cluster (5,3 / 5,2 / 6,3) while still allowing me to contest or avoid Snake #1. Enemy head at (3,5) could swap with me by moving LEFT \u2014 that\u2019s acceptable (we\u2019d swap) \u2014 the main deadly outcome (both moving into same cell) is only possible if both try to enter the same target cell on the same turn; going RIGHT does not create a higher head-on risk than other moves.\n\nShort-term plan (next turns):\n- Move to (3,5) now to increase mobility.\n- From there, prefer moving RIGHT toward (4,5) and then down toward the apples at (5,3)/(5,2)/(6,3), avoiding direct head-on duels with the enemy. If Snake #1 commits down to (3,4), I can either take that apple or pivot right to safer apples depending on their commitment.\n\nRIGHT",
