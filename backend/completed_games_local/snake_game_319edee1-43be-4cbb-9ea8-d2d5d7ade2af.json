The apple at (6,2) is quite far below, so not immediately accessible, but moving upward leaves options open for moving toward other apples or strategic positions.\n\n- Moving **DOWN** (to (6,4)): Also safe, yet it moves closer to the enemy's position at (6,0), which might pose a risk if they remain there, but as they are far, immediate danger is low. Moving down could be leveraged to approach eggs accessible at (6,2) or navigate the bottom side later.\n\n- Moving **LEFT** (to (5,5)): This would mean moving into where the tail was, assuming the tail hasn't moved, which is safe generally, but moving left may quickly position us toward the walls on the left, reducing options, and might risk being trapped if not cautious.\n\n- Moving **RIGHT** (to (7,5)): This would take us further right along the x-axis. We are already moving right now, and it\u2019s a safe move, opening options to head toward the apple at (9,9) or moving upward along the right edge, which is relatively open.\n\nGiven all considerations: moving **UP** or **RIGHT** are both safe. Moving **UP** keeps options open toward the apples at (6,2) or further up, but the apple at (6,2) is below us, so upward movement doesn't directly help reach that apple immediately.\n\nMoving **RIGHT** positions us further to the right, better for approaching other apples and maintaining mobility.\n\nBetween the two, **RIGHT** seems more promising because it continues along the current trajectory, offers more open space ahead, and keeps us aligned toward potentially reachable apples or safe paths.\n\nI will choose to move **RIGHT** to keep options open and advance toward promising areas on the board.\n\nRIGHT",
