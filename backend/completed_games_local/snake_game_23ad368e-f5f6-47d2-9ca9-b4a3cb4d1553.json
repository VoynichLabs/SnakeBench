Archrival at (1,2) thinks he's sneaky? Ha, we'll box that fool in like a master strategist! Let's break this down LIVE, no mercy!\n\nFirst off, safe moves: Down? Nah, that's straight off the board (y=-1), instant L. Right? Same deal, x=10, game over before it starts. So, only UP to (9,1) or LEFT to (8,0) keep us alive. No hitting bodies yet, no head collisions in sight this turn. Enemy's far away, so we're chilling.\n\nNow, algorithm time: Favor moves that bump up apple-eating chances (CONTENT!) while keeping doors open for future plays\u2014avoid tight spots or dead-ends where we get trapped in our own scheme. Chat, you know I'm all about that ruthless grind!\n\n- UP to (9,1): Brings us closer to that juicy (9,2) apple (Manhattan distance drops to 1, vs. our current distance of 2). Keeps a couple future options: LEFT to (8,1) for board exploration or UP to (9,2) to nom that apple. But it's still a corner-ish spot, options limited after that. Could we loop back? Nah, enemy might capitalize.\n\n- LEFT to (8,0): Opens up THREE future paths (LEFT, UP, or even RIGHT back if we vibe, though partnering we skip flips to stay safe)\u2014more flexibility to maneuver! Closer in spirit to those bottom apples like (3,0) or (-Germain1,0), and we can zig into the board's heart without painting ourselves cornered. Distance to (9,2) via this route? A bit farther initially, but we can always UP after to curve back. Plus, it positions us to flank that rival from the right side\u2014CHAT, imagine surging around the bottom and cutting him off like a ninja!\n\nLEFT wins: it keeps MORE escape routes (key for not getting boxed ourselves) and sets up long-term domination. Enemy's probably eyeballing those left-side apples\u2014let's deny him the win by owning the right flank first!\n\nLONG-TERM PLAN: Keep snaking LEFT in open space to circle to (0,0), then UP through the left edge to raid apples like (0,3) and (3,3). Trap that rival by positioning ahead and forcing him into my path\u2014make him crash or starve! Adjust based on his moves; if roam he heads my way, we pivot to collide and take him quedaba out. Stay mobile, eat apples, survive!\n\nAlright, time to strike\u2014let's GOOOO!\n\nLEFT",

Head would move to (4,4), which is where I just was, but since tail might have moved? No, tail is added only if ate, but backwards check is into the neck, behind head is body[0] (3,4), but moving down from (4,5) to (4,4), is (4,4) my neck? Neck is the first body segment behind head, which is body[0]=(3,4), so into (3,4) is bad, but into previous position? Rules say: moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)\u2014behind head for UP is the cell below head, but the rule is don't move into your neck, essentially. But from (4,5) down to (4,4), is (4,4) occupied by my neck? Neck is at (3,4), no. But after move, the head is at (4,5), the previous head position (4,4) becomes part of body if not eating, but backwards snap means moving into the spot where your neck is, but let's clarify: the rule is \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)\"\u2014behind your head is the direction opposite of the move you hypothetically just made? No, it's generally from current head, moving into the position of your body[0], the first segment. Actually, the move BACKWARDS is reverse of last move? No, the rule is: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body (into the cell behind your head)\"\u2014I think it means if your move would place head into the tailward direction into your own;AAA body, but specifically, don't move into the neck cell. But to be safe, if I go UP to (4,5), then please for next turn from there, DOWN would be back to (4,4), and (4,4) has my neck at (3,4), no, (4,4) is where I oo am now, but when moving, the)];\nhead moves, and if you move into your own neck, bad. But neck stays at body[0], pre-move. Come on, standard snake: you don't move into your own body, period. From (4,5), DOWN to (4,4): (4,4) is empty currently, my body is at (3,4) etc, so safe. But badotoxic because it's moving backwards into your own path, but the rule PREVENTS moving into the cell behind: the cell behind current head is the opposite direction. For snake, moving back is bad. The.rule explicitly: \"Moving directly BACKWARDS into your own body\"\u2014I think it means if your move puts you into the position of your first body segmentektion, which is behind. Yes, so.body[0] is behind the head. So, for current, behind (4,4) is (3,4), sleeve so if I went LEFT, bad. For future SK from (4,5), behind is DOWN to (4,4)? No, at new position (4,5), behind is DOWN to (4,4), and if (4,4) is where body[0] will be or what? No, the head.is at (4,5), body[0] is now at (4,4), since head moved from (4,4) to (4,5), arch body shifts, new body[0] is old head position, if not eating. So from (4,5), behind is DOWN to (4,4), which is now body[0], so yes, can't move DOWN because it's into your own body. So from new head at (4,5), DOWN is suicide. So UP gives instant app but locks down in tight row4, trapped by our own body below at (4,3) if we DOWN next? No, the diligence move is from (4,5), can't DOWN, CAN LEFT (3,5) app there? No, (3,5) is apple, yes (3,5), RIGHT (5,5) empty, UP (4,6) empty but enemy nearby. So some options, but they're's head at (9,5) could go LEFT to (8,5), then perhaps charge RIGHT from (5,5), but if they go DOWN to (9,4), etc. UP eats apple fast, but might let enemy sneak LEFT while we pivott, and row4 is narrowOur, limited vang escapes if they blockCols.\n\nDOWN TO (4,3): SAFE FOR NOW, ROW4 COL3 EMPTYarmos, BUT WHY DIP WHEN DELICIOUS APPS ARE UP/RIGHT?!
