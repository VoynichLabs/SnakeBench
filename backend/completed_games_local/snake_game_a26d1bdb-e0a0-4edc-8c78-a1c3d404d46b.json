The enemy snake #1 is at (1,8) with no body. Apples are at: (1,9), (2,6), (9,4), (2,3), (9,3).\n\nLet me check each direction:\n\n1. **UP**: (6,7) - This is on the board. There's nothing at (6,7) - no snake, no apple. Safe.\n\n2. **DOWN**: (6,5) - This is on the board. Nothing at (6,5) - no snake, no apple. Safe.\n\n3. **LEFT**: (5,6) - This is on the board. Nothing at (5,6) - no snake, no apple. Safe.\n\n4. **RIGHT**: (7,6) - This is on the board. Nothing at (7,6) - no snake, no apple. Safe.\n\nAll four directions appear safe for immediate movement since there are no obstacles or snakes in those cells.\n\nNow, let's think about strategy:\n- I have 0 apples, enemy snake #1 has 0 apples\n- The closest apple to me is at (2,6) - that's 4 spaces to the left\n- There's also an apple at (9,3) - that's 3 down and 2 right\n- And (9,4) which is 3 down and 2 right\n- And (2,3) which is 3 down and 4 left\n\nLet me also consider enemy snake #1's position. They're at (1,8). The apple at (1,9) is directly above them, which they will likely go for.\n\nI should consider what the enemy might do. They're at (1,8), and there's an apple at (1,9) directly above them. That's a very obvious target. If I were them, I'd probably go UP to (1,9).\n\nIf they go UP to (1,9), and I want to avoid any potential collisions in the future, I should think about my path to apples.\n\nMy options:\n- If I go LEFT to (5,6), I'm getting closer to the apple at (2,6)\n- If I go DOWN to (6,5), I'm getting closer to apples at (2,3), (9,3), (9,4)\n- If I go UP to (6,7), I'm moving away from most apples\n- If I go RIGHT to (7,6), I'm moving closer to (9,3) and (9,4)\n\nGiven that I'm at (6,6), let me calculate distances to apples:\n- (2,6): distance = 4 (left) - closest\n- (9,3): distance = |9-6| + |3-6| = 3 + 3 = 6\n- (9,4): distance = |9-6| + |4-6| = 3 + 2 = 5\n- (2,3): distance = |2-6| + |3-6| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\nSo the apple at (2,6) is clearly the closest. To get there, I need to go LEFT.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that the enemy at (1,8) might go UP to get (1,9), and then they'll be at (1,9). They might then go for (2,6) as well, though that's a longer path for them.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible moves:\n- UP to (1,9) - gets the apple there\n- RIGHT to (2,8) - moves horizontally\n- DOWN to (1,7) - moves down\n- LEFT would be off board, so they won't do that\n\nIf they go UP to (1,9), they'll grow and be at (1,9) with their tail still at (1,8) temporarily.\n\nMy best move seems to be LEFT to (5,6), putting me closer to the apple at (2,6). From there, I can continue left.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's any chance of head-on collision. The enemy is at (1,8) and I'm at (6,6). Even if they go RIGHT and I go LEFT, we're still far apart. The only way we'd collide is if we both go to the same cell, which seems impossible given our distance.\n\nSo all moves are safe, and LEFT is the best strategic move to get the closest apple.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The apple at (2,6) is at the same y-coordinate as me (y=6). If I go LEFT to (5,6), then next turn I can go LEFT to (4,6), then (3,6), then (2,6) to get the apple. That's 4 turns to get the apple.\n\nAlternatively, if I go DOWN, I could go for the apple at (9,3) or (9,4). From (6,6) to (9,3) is 6 moves (3 right, 3 down). From (6,6) to (9,4) is 5 moves (3 right, 2 down). So LEFT is still better.\n\nTherefore, I'll go LEFT.\n\nLong-term plan: Go left to (2,6) to eat the apple there, then consider going down towards the apples at the bottom of the board.\n\nLEFT",

Other moves lack apple benefits and don't improve positioning as effectively.\n\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nAfter eating the apple, my body will be at (1,8). I must avoid moving DOWN immediately to prevent self-collision. Next, I'll target the apple at (2,6) while maintaining maneuverability.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nUP",

This is generally the safest option to avoid collision.\n    *   However, I move away from the apple at (2, 6) and the apple cluster on the right.\n*   If I move **LEFT to (2, 6)**:\n    *   I eat the apple and grow.\n    *   This brings me closer to the enemy at (2, 8).\n    *   If the enemy moves **DOWN to (2, 7)**, we will be vertically aligned with one cell gap (me at 6, enemy at 7). If I continue Left or Up/Down next, I can survive, but if I go Right, I hit them. I can also \"tuck\" at (2, 6) and wait, but that blocks my own movement.\n    *   This move decreases the space between me and the enemy, reducing my future maneuverability.\n*   If I move **RIGHT to (4, 6)**:\n    *   I move toward the cluster of apples on the right side of the board (9, 4) and (9, 3).\n    *   This increases the distance between me and the enemy.\n    *   This keeps the path South to (4, 0) open.\n    *   If the enemy moves **DOWN to (2, 7)**, the distance remains large.\n    *   If the enemy moves **RIGHT to (3, 8)**, they move closer to me, but we are still separated by rows (7 vs 6). A collision would require them to move Down twice (to (3,7) then (3,6)) before I move away.\n\n**Strategy Decision:**\nTo maximize longevity and score, I should prioritize survival and space. The Right move aligns me with the high-value apples on the right side of the board (9, 4) and (9, 3) while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake. The Left move brings me immediately closer to the enemy and could result in a trap if the enemy decides to move down. The Down move is safe but moves away from the accessible apples on the right.\n\nTherefore, moving **RIGHT** is the best choice to position for future apples and avoid immediate conflict.\n\nPlan: Move towards the right-side apples (9, 4 and 9, 3) while keeping distance from Enemy #1.\n\nRIGHT",

It positioned my head (4, 6) away from the enemy snake (currently at (2, 7)) and aligned me with the valuable right-side apples (9, 4) and (9, 3).\n\n2.  **Safety Analysis (Turn 4)**:\n    *   **Current Position**: (4, 6). Body: [].\n    *   **Enemy #1**: Head (2, 7), Body [(2, 8)].\n    *   **Potential Enemy Move**: If Enemy #1 moves **DOWN** to (2, 6), they will be adjacent to my current position (4, 6) and (2, 6). This is not an immediate collision but requires caution next turn.\n    *   **Potential Moves from (4, 6)**:\n        *   **UP to (4, 7)**: Empty (based on board). Safe.\n        *   **DOWN to (4, 5)**: Empty. Safe.\n        *   **LEFT to (3, 6)**: Empty (I moved from here). Safe.\n        *   **RIGHT to (5, 6)**: Empty. Safe.\n\n3.  **Strategic Evaluation**:\n    *   **LEFT (to 3, 6)**: Moves me back towards the center. While safe, it doesn't progress towards the apples on the right (9,4) and (9,3). If the enemy moves down to (2,6), we are closer.\n    *   **UP (to 4, 7)**: Moves closer to the top of the board. This could be a long-term trap if I head North while apples are South. It also brings me closer to potential enemy movement (2,7 -> 2,8 or 3,8).\n    *   **DOWN (to 4, 5)**: Moves me closer to the bottom apples (4,0) and (9,4). This keeps me in the central-lower area, maintaining distance from the enemy at (2,7).\n    *   **RIGHT (to 5, 6)**: Moves me towards the cluster of apples at (9,4) and (9,3). This is the direction with the most future scoring potential. It increases the distance between me and the enemy snake.\n\n4.  **Decision**: Moving **RIGHT** continues the optimal path established in the previous turn. It maximizes distance from the immediate threat (Enemy #1 at (2,7)) and positions me to collect the right-side apples, which are currently the safest and most valuable targets.\n\n**Long-term plan**: Continue moving right along row 6 towards the apple at (9,4), while monitoring the enemy snake's position relative to the column 2 apples.\n\nRIGHT",

Safe.\n    *   *Result:* All 4 directions are immediately safe.\n\n2.  **Enemy Analysis (Snake #1):**\n    *   **Position:** Head at (2, 5), Body: [(2, 6), (2, 7)].\n    *   **Constraints:** Snake #1 is currently at x=2. It cannot move LEFT (would be off-board). It cannot move DOWN to (2, 4) because the current board state shows an Apple at (2, 3) but does *not* show a body segment at (2, 4).

So DOWN is a valid move for the enemy.\n        *   Moving UP puts it at (2, 6), which is its own body. **Illegal.**\n        *   Moving RIGHT puts it at (3, 5). This is currently empty. **Valid.**\n    *   **Conclusion:** Enemy will likely move DOWN (towards apples at 2,3) or RIGHT (exploring).\n    *   **Interaction:** Even if the enemy moves RIGHT to (3, 5), it is still far away (distance 3 in x, 1 in y). No immediate head-on collision threat.\n\n3.  **Apple Strategy & Pathing:**\n    *   **Target Cluster 1 (Right Side):** (9, 4) and (9, 3). Distance: Manhattan distance ~5-6. This requires moving RIGHT.\n    *   **Target Cluster 2 (Up/Right):** (4, 8). Distance: Manhattan distance 4. This requires moving UP then LEFT/RIGHT.\n    *   **Target Cluster 3 (Left/Down):** (4, 0). Distance: Large (Manhattan ~10). Requires LEFT/DOWN.\n    *   **Analysis of Moves:**\n        *   **RIGHT:** Moves towards the cluster of 2 apples at (9,4) and (9,3). This direction (East) is open (x=7,8,9 are empty). This also increases the x-distance from Snake #1 (currently at x=2), reducing the chance of future encounters.\n        *   **UP:** Moves towards (4,8). However, moving UP increases proximity to the wall at y=9 and the enemy body at y=7. While safe now, it might force a turn into a tighter space later (x=2-x=5 area).\n        *   **LEFT:** Moves towards (4,0). This is a long term plan and moves closer to the enemy (x=2).\n        *   **DOWN:** Moves towards (4,0). Similar to LEFT, long term, and puts us in the bottom corner.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    Moving **RIGHT** is the optimal choice. It heads directly towards the highest density of apples (the pair at 9,4 and 9,3) while maintaining an open board state and maximizing distance from the opponent.

Manhattan distance from (7,6) is roughly 2+2=4 to (9,4) and 2+3=5 to (9,3).\n    *   **Target Cluster 2 (Up/Right):** (4, 8). Distance is 3 in x, 2 in y.\n    *   **Target Cluster 3 (Left/Down):** (4, 0). Distance is 3 in x, 6 in y.\n    *   **Analysis of Moves:**\n        *   **RIGHT:** Moves directly toward the tight cluster of 2 apples at (9,4) and (9,3). The path East (x=8,9) is currently completely clear of obstacles.\n        *   **UP:** Moves toward (4,8) and the top wall. While safe, moving UP moves away from the dense cluster on the right.\n        *   **LEFT:** Moves away from the closest apples and toward the center/open area.\n        *   **DOWN:** Moves toward (4,0). This is a long-term target.\n\n4.  **Decision:**\n    Moving **RIGHT** is the optimal choice. It pursues the highest density of apples (the pair at 9,4/9,3) with the shortest path and no obstacles. It also maintains maximum distance from Snake #1. Continuing right sets up a path to eat these two apples efficiently.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Keep moving RIGHT to reach x=8 or x=9 to align with the apples at (9,4) and (9,3).\n\nRIGHT",

The last move was LEFT, moving from (9, 6) to (8, 6).\n\nSince I am at (8, 6), I have two immediate threats to consider for the upcoming turn:\n1.  **Enemy Snake #1 at (4, 3):** With 3 apples collected, its body length is 4 (head + 3 body segments). The segments are at (4,3), (3,3), (2,3), (2,4). The neck is at (3,3), meaning the snake cannot move LEFT.

The enemy snake is far away. The board at y=6 is empty at x=7.\n    *   Enemy Prediction: The enemy snake cannot reach x=7 next turn (it moves max 1 step). Even if it moved RIGHT to (5,3), it is safe.\n    *   **Result: SAFE.** This allows me to navigate towards the apple at (4,8) or (4,0), or just maneuver.\n\n2.  **UP (8, 7):**\n    *   Coordinates: (8, 7) is on the board.\n    *   Conflict check: Empty at (8,7) currently.\n    *   Enemy Prediction: Safe.\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n\n3.  **DOWN (8, 5):**\n    *   Coordinates: (8, 5) is on the board.\n    *   Conflict check: Empty at (8,5) currently.\n    *   Enemy Prediction: Safe.\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 6):**\n    *   Coordinates: (9, 6) is on the board.\n    *   Conflict check: Empty at (9,6) currently.\n    *   Enemy Prediction: Safe.\n    *   **Result: SAFE.**\n\n**Strategy for Turn 11:**\nI am safe to move in any direction. The enemy snake is at (4,3). The closest apple to me is at (4,8) (Manhattan distance 7). The apple at (9,4) is distance 4, but the enemy is at (4,3) and might be going for (9,3) and (9,4) (based on the previous analysis mentioning them). However, the enemy is far away.\nTo maintain flexibility and avoid potential traps, I should not hug the right wall (x=9) unless necessary. Moving **LEFT** brings me closer to the center of the board, providing more options to chase apples at (4,8) or (4,0) in subsequent turns. It also keeps me away from the potential path of the enemy if it decides to go right towards the apples at (9,3) and (9,4).\n\nMoving **LEFT** to (7,6) is the most flexible move. It opens up the board.\n\nLong-term plan: Navigate towards the apple cluster at (4,8), (5,0), (4,0). Avoid the enemy. If the enemy goes for the (9,3), (9,4) apples, I can let them have them and take the center/top apples.\n\nI will move LEFT.\n\nLEFT",

I must trust the visual board representation for the current state.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  **Current Position**: `(5, 5)` (Head `0` on board).\n2.  **Apples**:\n    *   Closest apples are at `(4, 0)` and `(5, 0)` (bottom row).\n    *   Other apples are far away: `(9, 4)`, `(4, 8)`, `(8, 5)`.\n3.  **Enemy Snake #1**:\n    *   Head: `(9, 3)` (Visual `1` at `(9, 3)`).\n    *   Body: `[(8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3)]` (Visual `T`'s). **Wait**, the visual shows `T`'s at `(5, 3), (6, 3), (7, 3), (8, 3)`. The text says `[(8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3)]`.\n    *   The enemy head is at `(9, 3)`. If it moves `LEFT`, it will go to `(8, 3)`, which is currently occupied by its own body. So it **cannot** move `LEFT`.\n    *   It is trapped in the row `y=3` unless it turns `UP` or `DOWN`.\n    *   `UP` leads to `(9, 4)`, which is an apple.\n    *   `DOWN` leads to `(9, 2)`.\n    *   It is effectively blocked from entering the center of the board (where I am) by its own body.\n\n4.  **My Moves**:\n    *   **UP**: `(5, 6)` -> Empty. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN**: `(5, 4)` -> Empty. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT**: `(4, 5)` -> Empty. Safe.\n    *   **RIGHT**: `(6, 5)` -> Empty. Safe.\n\n5.  **Strategy**:\n    *   I need to reach the apples at `(4, 0)` and `(5, 0)`.\n    *   Descending `DOWN` is the most direct path.\n    *   I must also consider the \"Silver Ratio\" of food density. The bottom row has 2 apples `(4,0)` and `(5,0)`. The top/right has 3 apples, but that area is occupied by Snake #1.\n    *   Snake #1 is currently at `(9, 3)` with a body at `(8, 3)...(5, 3)`.\n    *   If I go `DOWN` to `(5, 4)`, I am one step closer to the bottom food.\n    *   From `(5, 4)`, I can go `DOWN` to `(5, 3)`... wait, ` (5, 3)` is occupied by Snake #1's tail? No, the text says `[(8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3)]` means `(8, 3)` connects to `(7, 3)`, so `(5, 3)` is the **tail**.\n    *   So ` (5, 3)` is a danger zone.\n    *   However, if I move `DOWN` to `(5, 4)` now, I am safe.\n    *   The enemy snake is likely to move `UP` to eat the apple at `(9, 4)` or move `DOWN`/`UP` to survive. It cannot `LEFT`.\n    *   Moving `DOWN` towards `(5, 0)` seems the best path. I will be careful to avoid `(5, 3)` if the snake is still there next turn (but the tail usually moves, unless it eats).\n    *   Let's check `LEFT` to `(4, 5)`. This moves me to `x=4`. From there, I can go `DOWN` to `(4, 4), (4, 3), (4, 2), (4, 1), (4, 0)` (Apple). This avoids the `(5, 3)` blockage entirely.\n    *   `RIGHT` to `(6, 5)` moves me away from the bottom food.\n    *   `UP` to `(5, 6)` moves me away from the bottom food.\n    *   So the choice is between `LEFT` (to `4,5`) and `DOWN` (to `5,4`).\n    *   If I go `DOWN` to `(5, 4)`: Next turn I can `LEFT` to `(4, 4)` or `DOWN` to `(5, 3)` (danger, might be blocked by enemy tail).\n    *   If I go `LEFT` to `(4, 5)`: Next turn I can `DOWN` to `(4, 4)` (approaching left side of food).\n    *   Both are safe now. `LEFT` positions me to approach the food at `(4,0)` through `x=4`, keeping `x=5` open as a potential route if `x=4` is blocked. It also keeps me further from the enemy's potential move range (though it's trapped).\n\n    *Re-evaluating Enemy:* If the enemy is at `(9,3)`, it can only go `UP` (to `(9,4)` apple), `DOWN` (to `(9,2)`), or `RIGHT` (die). It will likely go `UP`.\n    *Re-evaluating My Path:* I want `(4,0)` and `(5,0)`.\n    *   `LEFT` to `(4,5)` is a good \"setup\" move. It aligns me with the apple at `(4,0)` and the apple at `(4,8)` (if I wanted to go up later).\n    *   `DOWN` to `(5,4)` is also good.\n    *   The enemy body is at `(5,3)`. If I go `DOWN` to `(5,4)`, I am directly above the enemy tail. The enemy tail is at `(5,3)`. If the enemy moves and grows, the tail might stay or move. If the enemy moves, its tail will vacate `(5,3)` only if it doesn't eat. If it eats, the tail stays.\n    *   Actually, the enemy body is `(8,3)->(7,3)->(6,3)->(5,3)`. If the enemy head at `(9,3)` moves `UP` to `(9,4)` (Apple), it grows. The tail `(5,3)` **stays**. So `(5,3)` is blocked.\n    *   Therefore, if I go `DOWN` to `(5,4)`, I am safe for this turn. Next turn, `(5,3)` is still blocked. I would have to `LEFT` to `(4,4)`.\n    *   If I go `LEFT` to `(4,5)` now, I can go `DOWN` to `(4,4)` next turn.\n    *   Both paths eventually lead down. `LEFT` seems slightly safer as it moves away from the enemy's column `x=8,9` and its body at `x=5` (if I were to run into it later).\n    *   Also, the apple at `(4,8)` is accessible via `LEFT` then `UP`.\n    *   Let's go `LEFT`. It keeps the bottom-left apple `(4,0)` in sight and avoids the immediate danger of the enemy's column.\n\n    *Wait, checking the board again.* The enemy body at `(5,3)` is the tail. The head is at `(9,3)`.\n    *   If I go `DOWN` to `(5,4)`, I am at `(5,4)`. The enemy tail is at `(5,3)`. I am safe.\n    *   If I go `LEFT` to `(4,5)`, I am at `(4,5)`. No dangers there.\n    *   I will move `LEFT` to `(4,5)`. This aligns me with the apple at `(4,0)`.\n\n    *Reasoning for LEFT vs DOWN:*\n    *   Target: `(4,0)` and `(5,0)`.\n    *   From `(5,5)`, `LEFT` -> `(4,5)`. Next turn `DOWN` -> `(4,4)`. Path: `(4,4), (4,3), (4,2), (4,1), (4,0)`.\n    *   From `(5,5)`, `DOWN` -> `(5,4)`. Next turn `LEFT` -> `(4,4)`. Path: `(4,4)`.\n    *   The `LEFT` move puts me on the perfect vertical track for the `(4,0)` apple without risking `(5,3)` blockage (though `(5,3)` is currently safe distance at `(5,4)`). Actually, `(5,3)` is blocked by enemy tail. If I go `DOWN` to `(5,4)`, I am safe. If I go `LEFT` to `(4,5)`, I am also safe.\n    *   I prefer `LEFT` because it moves me to `x=4`, aligning with the apple at `(4,0)`. The apple at `(5,0)` is also reachable. If the enemy at `(9,3)` moves `UP` to `(9,4)` (Apple), it grows, and its tail at `(5,3)` stays. So `x=5` remains blocked at `y=3`. `x=4` is open.\n\n    *Final Check:*\n    *   Move `LEFT` to `(4, 5)`.\n    *   Board: `0` is at `(5,5)`.\n    *   `LEFT` -> `(4, 5)`.\n    *   Is `(4, 5)` valid? Yes.\n    *   Is it safe? Yes, empty.\n    *   Strategy: Go to `(4, 0)`.\n\n    *Wait, is there an apple at (4,0)?* Yes, the text list says `(4, 0)`. The board shows `A` at `(4, 0)`. Yes.\n    *Is there an apple at (5,0)?* Yes. The board shows `A` at `(5, 0)`.\n    *Is there an apple at (4,8)?* Yes. The board shows `A` at `(4, 8)`.\n\n    Moving `LEFT` puts me on the X-axis of all these apples. This is a strong strategic position.\n\n    Double check the \"Last Move\" info.\n    Text says \"Head: (4, 5)\".\n    Board says `0` at `(5, 5)`.\n    The text description of my head is likely from the *previous* turn's state or is an error.\n    I must trust the board.\n    Board:\n    ```\n     5 . . . . 0 . . . A .\n    ```\n    X=5, Y=5.\n    Moving LEFT -> X=4, Y=5.\n\n    The board shows `A` at `(8, 5)`.\n    The board shows `A` at `(4, 8)`.\n    The board shows `A` at `(4, 0)`.\n    The board shows `A` at `(5, 0)`.\n    The board shows `A` at `(9, 4)`.\n\n    The enemy at `(9, 3)` is blocked left. It will likely go `UP`.\n    If I go `LEFT` to `(4, 5)`, I am safe.\n\n    *Wait, checking the \"Last Move\" rationale.*\n    It says: \"I will move **LEFT** to (4,5) ... The board shows `0` at `(5,5)` ... moving `LEFT` to `(4,5)`...\"\n    The previous turn's AI decided `LEFT` to `(4,5)` but ended up at `(5,5)`?\n    Or did the AI move `LEFT` from `(6,5)` to `(5,5)`?\n    If the previous move was `LEFT`, and the head is at `(5,5)` now, then the previous head was `(6,5)`.\n    The \"Last Move Information\" says \"LEFT\".\n    So I moved from `(6,5)` to `(5,5)`.\n    The rationale text in the prompt has a confusing part: \"I will move **LEFT** to (4,5) ... The board shows 0 at 5,5\".\n    It seems the *intended* move was `(4,5)`, but the *actual* position is `(5,5)`.\n    Or, the rationale is from a simulation where the move was `LEFT` and the result was `(5,5)`.\n    Wait, if I was at `(5,5)` and moved `LEFT`, I'd be at `(4,5)`.\n    If I am at `(5,5)` now, and the last move was `LEFT`, I must have been at `(6,5)` before.\n    The prompt says \"Head: (4, 5)\" in the text description. This is likely an error in the text description vs the Board.\n    I trust the Board.\n\n    Board state:\n    5 . . . . 0 . . . A .\n    (x=5, y=5).\n    \n    Next move:\n    Target: Bottom apples `(4,0)` and `(5,0)`.\n    Path: `LEFT` to `(4,5)` is a good step.\n    Or `DOWN` to `(5,4)`.\n    \n    Enemy Snake #1 at `(9, 3)`:\n    Body: `(8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3), (5, 3)`.\n    It is blocked `LEFT`.\n    It will move `UP` to `(9, 4)` (Apple) or `DOWN`.\n    If it moves `UP`, it eats apple at `(9, 4)`.\n    Its tail `(5, 3)` stays.\n    \n    My move `LEFT` to `(4, 5)`:\n    - Safe (empty).\n    - Aligns with `(4, 0)` apple.\n    - Aligns with `(4, 8)` apple.\n    - Avoids `(5, 3)` obstacle (though `(5, 4)` is safe too).\n    \n    Let's consider `DOWN` to `(5, 4)`.\n    - Safe.\n    - Closer to `(5, 0)` apple.\n    - But `x=5` has a blockage at `(5, 3)` (enemy tail).\n    - To reach `(5, 0)` from `(5, 4)`, I need to go `DOWN` to `(5, 3)`.\n    - `(5, 3)` is currently blocked.\n    - If the enemy tail moves later (when the snake moves and doesn't eat), it will free up `(5, 3)`.\n    - However, the enemy is at `(9, 3)`. It has a long tail. It eats at `(9, 4)`. It will grow. The tail `(5, 3)` will remain for several turns.\n    - So I cannot go to `(5, 3)` immediately.\n    - Therefore, `DOWN` to `(5, 4)` allows me to go `LEFT` next, or `DOWN` is blocked.\n    - If I go `LEFT` to `(4, 5)`, I can go `DOWN` to `(4, 4), (4, 3)...` all the way to `(4, 0)` without hitting the enemy tail (which is at `x=5`).\n    - `LEFT` is strictly better for reaching the `(4, 0)` apple safely.\n\n    Summary:\n    - Current pos: `(5, 5)`.\n    - Target: `(4, 0)`.\n    - Move: `LEFT`.\n    - Result: `(4, 5)`.\n    - Safety: High.\n\n    Check if I can go `RIGHT` to `(6, 5)`.\n    - `RIGHT` leads away from the close bottom apples.\n    - `RIGHT` leads towards `(8, 5)` (Apple) and `(9, 4)` (Apple).\n    - However, the enemy is at `(9, 3)`. It might move to `(9, 4)`.\n    - If I go `RIGHT`, I am moving towards the enemy.\n    - `LEFT` is safer.\n\n    Check `UP` to `(5, 6)`.\n    - Moves away from the bottom apples.\n    - Goes towards `(4, 8)` (Apple).\n    - But `(4, 0)` and `(5, 0)` are closer.\n    - `LEFT` is better.\n\n    Decision: `LEFT`.\n\n    Long-term plan: Move `LEFT` to `(4,5)`. Then `DOWN` to `(4,4)`. Follow the `x=4` column down to `(4,0)`. Avoid the enemy at `x=9` and its tail at `x=5, y=3`.\n\n    Final check on \"Last Move\":\n    The rationale says \"I will move LEFT to (4,5)\".\n    The board shows head at (5,5).\n    If the last move was LEFT, previous head was (6,5).\n    If the rationale intended to go to (4,5), it failed or the board state is (6,5) and I misread?\n    Let's re-read the board text carefully.\n    ` 5 . . . . 0 . . . A .`\n    Index 0 is `.` (0)\n    Index 1 `.` (1)\n    Index 2 `.` (2)\n    Index 3 `.` (3)\n    Index 4 `.` (4)\n    Index 5 `0` (5)\n    Index 6 `.` (6)\n    ...\n    So `0` is at index 5. X=5.\n    My head is at (5, 5).\n\n    So, I move from (5,5).\n    Options: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n    LEFT -> (4,5). Good.\n\n    One detail: The prompt says \"Moving directly backwards into your own body ... counts as hitting yourself\".\n    I have no body. So I can reverse if I had a body, but I don't. I can move anywhere valid.\n    \n    Wait, the text says \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (4, 5) Body: none\".\n    This is highly contradictory. The board says `(5, 5)`.\n    If I am at `(4, 5)`, then `LEFT` takes me to `(3, 5)`.\n    If I am at `(5, 5)`, `LEFT` takes me to `(4, 5)`.\n    The text description of my snake's state is likely from the *previous* turn's planning, or just wrong.\n    The \"Board state\" is the visual truth. The board shows `0` at `x=5, y=5`.\n    Therefore, I am at `(5, 5)`.\n    \n    Wait, if I was at `(4, 5)` and the last move was `LEFT`, I would be at `(3, 5)`.\n    The prompt says \"Your last move information: ... LEFT\".\n    If I am at `(5, 5)` now, and I just moved `LEFT`, I must have been at `(6, 5)`.\n    This makes sense. The board shows `(5, 5)`.\n    The text description of my head `(4, 5)` is likely a typo or old data.\n    I trust the board.\n    \n    So, I am at `(5, 5)`.\n    I will move `LEFT` to `(4, 5)`.\n    \n    Is there any risk at `(4, 5)`?\n    Board:\n    Row 5: `. . . . 0 . . . A .` (Wait, 0 is at index 5. Row 5 has `0` at x=5.\n    Row 4: `. . . . . . . . . A` (Apple at x=9).\n    Row 3: `. . . . . T T T T 1` (Enemy at x=9).\n    Row 2: Empty.\n    Row 1: Empty.\n    Row 0: `. . . . A A . . . .` (Apples at x=4, 5).\n    \n    So `(4, 5)` is empty.\n    `(4, 5)` is safe.\n    `(4, 5)` is a good step towards `(4, 0)`.\n\n    I will move `LEFT`.\n\n    One thought: If the text \"Head: (4, 5)\" is correct and the board is just a map of *obstacles/apples* and the '0' is just a symbol for \"My Head is here\" but the coordinate is actually (4,5)?\n    No, the board has a grid system `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`.\n    The '0' is at column index 5.\n    So `X=5`.\n    I am at `(5, 5)`.\n    The text \"Head: (4, 5)\" is ignored.\n\n    Move: LEFT.\n\n    Strategy Note: I will move LEFT to align with the apple at (4,0). The enemy at (9,3) is trapped to the left by its own body, so it will likely move UP or DOWN. I am safe.\n\n    Final check: \"Your last move was LEFT\".\n    Current: (5,5).\n    My last move was LEFT? That means I came from (6,5).\n    The rationale in the prompt says \"I will move LEFT to (4,5)\".\n    This implies the AI *thought* it was at (5,5) or intended to be at (4,5).\n    If the AI was at (5,5) and moved LEFT, it would be at (4,5).\n    The board shows the head at (5,5).\n    So the AI was at (6,5).\n    The \"I will move LEFT to (4,5)\" in the previous rationale was likely a typo (meant (5,5)) or the board state is slightly different.\n    Regardless, I am at (5,5).\n    I will move LEFT to (4,5).\n\n    Is (4,5) safe?\n    Yes.\n    Is it strategic?\n    Yes, towards (4,0).\n    \n    One detail: The board shows `A` at `(8, 5)`.\n    If I go `RIGHT` to `(6, 5)`, then `(7, 5)`, then `(8, 5)`.\n    But `(8, 5)` is close to the enemy at `(9, 3)`.\n    If the enemy moves `UP` to `(9, 4)`, it is at `(9, 4)`. It will be adjacent to `(8, 4)` and `(8, 5)`.\n    If I am at `(8, 5)`, and the enemy is at `(9, 4)`, we are not colliding heads.\n    However, `(9, 4)` is an apple. If the enemy eats it, it grows.\n    If I go for `(8, 5)`, I risk running into the enemy if it moves `LEFT` (it can't, blocked).\n    If the enemy moves `DOWN`, it goes to `(9, 2)`.\n    `RIGHT` is riskier due to proximity to the enemy.\n    `LEFT` is safer.\n\n    Plan: Move LEFT to (4,5). Then DOWN to (4,4). Then DOWN to (4,3)... to (4,0). Watch out for the enemy tail at (5,3). If it clears, I can go to (5,0) after (4,0).\n\n    Move: LEFT.\n\n    Just to be absolutely sure about the coordinate system:\n    Y increases UP.\n    X increases RIGHT.\n    (0,0) bottom left.\n    Board:\n    9 . . . . . . . . . .\n    ...\n    0 . . . . A A . . . .\n    Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n    \n    My head `0` is at index 5 on row 5. So (5,5).\n    \n    Correct. Move LEFT.\n\n    Wait, looking at the \"Scores so far\", I have 0 apples. Enemy has 4. I am losing. I must eat.\n    The closest apples are (4,0) and (5,0).\n    (4,0) is reachable via LEFT path.\n    (5,0) is reachable via DOWN path, but blocked by enemy tail at (5,3).\n    If I go LEFT, I can get (4,0). Then maybe (5,0) if the tail moves.\n    Or I can go UP to (4,8).\n    (4,0) is the best target.\n\n    Move: LEFT.\n\n    I will write the rationale.\n    - Current pos (5,5).\n    - Target (4,0).\n    - Move LEFT.\n    - Enemy trapped.\n    - Safe.\n\n    Wait, checking the \"Last Rationale\" again. It says \"The board shows `0` at `(5,5)` ... I will move **LEFT** to `(4,5)`\".\n    This is exactly what I am thinking.\n    So the \"Last Rationale\" implies the AI was at `(6,5)` and moved `LEFT` to `(5,5)` (which is what happened).\n    The text \"Head: (4, 5)\" in the snake description is the error.\n    I am at `(5, 5)`.\n    I will move `LEFT` to `(4, 5)`.\n\n    One edge case: Snake #1 is at (9,3).\n    If it moves `UP` to (9,4) (Apple), it grows.\n    If it moves `DOWN` to (9,2), it moves away.\n    It cannot `LEFT`.\n    It is far away from me.\n    I am safe.\n\n    If I am at (4,5), I can go DOWN to (4,4). (4,3) is empty. (4,2) is empty. (4,1) is empty. (4,0) is Apple.\n    This path is clear.\n    \n    What about (5,0)? It is an apple. If I go to (4,0) and eat it, I grow. My tail will extend.\n    If the enemy tail at (5,3) moves away, I can eat (5,0).\n    If I go `LEFT` to (4,5), I am one step closer to the column where both apples are.\n    \n    I will stick with `LEFT`.\n\n    Final check on \"Last Move\" info:\n    \"Your last move was LEFT\".\n    Current board: 0 at (5,5).\n    So I was at (6,5) before.\n    This is consistent.\n\n    I am confident in `LEFT`.\n\n    One small thing: The board shows `A` at `(8, 5)`.\n    If I go `RIGHT`, I can eat `(8, 5)` relatively soon (3 steps).\n    But Snake #1 is at `(9, 3)`.\n    If Snake #1 moves `UP` to `(9, 4)`, it is next to `(8, 4)`.\n    If I go to `(8, 5)`, I am next to `(9, 5)`.\n    It's a bit risky to get close to the enemy.\n    `LEFT` is safer.\n\n    Also, if I go `LEFT`, I might find a new apple later.\n    The bottom row has 2 apples.\n    The top row has 1 apple (9,4).\n    The row 8 has 1 apple (4,8).\n    The row 5 has 1 apple (8,5).\n    So the bottom has the highest density of apples (2 in 2 tiles).\n    I should go down.\n    `LEFT` allows me to go down safely.\n\n    Moving `LEFT`.\n\n    One detail: The prompt says \"If you move onto an apple, you grow\".\n    I need to check if `(4, 5)` is an apple. No, board shows `.`\n    \n    Final check: Is there any other snake?\n    Only Snake #1.\n    \n    Decision: LEFT.\n\n    Wait, what if I go DOWN to (5,4)?\n    Then I am at (5,4).\n    Next turn I am stuck because (5,3) is blocked by enemy tail (if enemy eats at (9,4)).\n    If I go LEFT to (4,5), I can go DOWN to (4,4), (4,3)...\n    Yes, `LEFT` is strictly better.\n\n    Move: LEFT.\n\n    I will write the rationale explaining the coordinate correction and the strategy.\n\n    Wait, \"Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (4, 5)\".\n    If this is true, I am at (4, 5).\n    Then I should not move LEFT, because I am already at x=4.\n    But the board clearly shows `0` at index 5.\n    The board is the source of truth for the visual layout.\n    The text description of the snake state seems to be inaccurate (likely a copy-paste error from a previous state where the head WAS at 4,5, or a planning error).\n    I will trust the board.\n    Board: `0` at (5,5).\n\n    I will move LEFT.\n\n    (Just considering the text \"Head: (4, 5)\" again. If I am actually at (4,5), then `LEFT` goes to (3,5). `DOWN` goes to (4,4). `DOWN` is better to reach (4,0). `LEFT` moves me away from the apple at (4,0) if I am at (4,5). But I am NOT at (4,5). I am at (5,5). The board wins.)\n\n    Correct move: LEFT.\n\n    Wait, if the board is 10x10, indices 0-9.\n    (5,5) is center.\n    (4,5) is left.\n    (6,5) is right.\n    \n    Plan: Align with x=4 column to eat (4,0). This also aligns with (4,8).\n\n    Move: LEFT.Based on the visual board state, my snake is currently at coordinates (5, 5), despite the text description stating (4, 5). I will trust the visual board as the ground truth.\n\nMy priority is to reach the cluster of apples on the bottom row, specifically (4, 0) and (5, 0), to close the score gap with Snake #1.\n\nSnake #1 is currently at (9, 3) with a body blocking its left side, meaning it is effectively trapped in the right column. It will likely move Up to eat the apple at (9, 4) or Down. It poses no immediate threat to the center of the board.\n\nMoving **LEFT** to (4, 5) is the optimal move. It positions my head directly above the apple at (4, 0), allowing for a safe descent along the X=4 column to collect it. Moving Down to (5, 4) would block my path to the bottom apples due to Snake #1's tail at (5, 3), requiring an extra turn to maneuver around. Moving Right or Up moves me away from the closest food.\n\nLong-term plan: Descend along the X=4 column to eat (4, 0). After eating, evaluate if Snake #1's tail has moved to allow access to (5, 0).\n\nLEFT",

          "rationale": "First, I need to understand the current state of the game. The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right. It's turn 17 out of 150.\n\nApples are at: (4, 0), (4, 8), (5, 0), (8, 5), (4, 2). So five apples on the board.\n\nMy snake (ID 0) is at head (2, 5), with no body segments, and I've collected 0 apples so far.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at head (9, 5), with body segments: [(9, 4), (9, 3), (8, 3), (7, 3), (6, 3)], and has 5 apples.\n\nThe board state is given visually:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 8: . . . . A . . . . .\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 5: . . 0 . . . . . A 1\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . T\nRow 3: . . . . . . T T T T\nRow 2: . . . . A . . . . .\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\nRow 0: . . . . A A . . . .\n\nWhere 0 is my head, 1 is enemy head, T is enemy tail, and A is apple.\n\nAlso, from the last move information, it says \"Your last move information: LEFT\" and the rationale says \"My current head position is at (5,5)\" but in the current state, it's given as (2,5). There might be a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, the last move rationale says: \"My current head position is at (5,5) based on the visual board state.\" But in the current board state, it's showing (2,5) for my head. Hmm, perhaps the board state is after my move? Let me check the turn: it says \"Turn: 17 / 150\" and \"Your last move information: LEFT\". So probably, in turn 16, I was at some position, moved LEFT, and now in turn 17, I'm at (2,5).\n\nBut in the rationale, it says \"My current head position is at (5,5)\", which might be a mistake or perhaps it's referring to the position before the move. Wait, no: the last move was LEFT, so if I was at (5,5) and moved LEFT, I would be at (4,5). But in the current state, it's (2,5). That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the board state is after the move, and the rationale is for the previous turn. Let me read carefully.\n\nThe \"Board state:\" is given as it is now, at turn 17. It shows my head at (2,5). But the rationale says \"My current head position is at (5,5)\", which might be an error in the rationale. Probably, the rationale is from the previous turn, when I was at (5,5) and decided to move LEFT to (4,5), but somehow the current state is (2,5). Wait, that doesn't add up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the board state is before my move? But the turn is 17, and it says \"Turn: 17 / 150\", and \"Your last move information: LEFT\", which should be the move I made in turn 16 to get to turn 17.\n\nWait, in Snake games, typically, you decide the move for the current turn, and then the turn advances. But here, it says \"Turn: 17 / 150\" and \"Your last move information: LEFT\", so probably, in turn 16, I moved LEFT, and now at the beginning of turn 17, the state is as given.\n\nBut in the state, my head is at (2,5), which doesn't match with moving from (5,5) to (4,5) with LEFT. Perhaps there's a confusion in the coordinates or in the display.\n\nWait, let's look at the board again. In row 5, it says \" . . 0 . . . . . A 1\", which corresponds to columns 0 to 9, so at (2,5) is '0', which is my head. So yes, my head is at (2,5).\n\nBut in the rationale, it says \"My current head position is at (5,5)\", which must be a mistake. Probably, the AI that generated the rationale had a different board state in mind. I should rely on the given board state, which shows me at (2,5).\n\nMoreover, the enemy snake #1 is at (9,5), with body extending down to (9,3), then left to (6,3). So the body is from (9,5) to (6,3) in a line: (9,5) - (9,4) - (9,3) - (8,3) - (7,3) - (6,3).\n\nWait, no: the body is listed as [(9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3)], so the head is (9,5), then (9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3). So the tail is at (6,3).\n\nIn the board, at row 4, it says \"T\" at (9,4), but actually, from the list, (9,4) is body, and (6,3) is tail. Wait, in the board, row 4 has \"T\" at (9,4), but that might be a mistake, or perhaps \"T\" is used for the tail position, but the list shows (6,3) as the last body part. Wait, the list says \"Body: [(9,4), (9,3), (8,3), (7,3), (6,3)]\", so (6,3) is the tail.\n\nBut in the board, at row 3, it says \"T T T T\" from (6,3) to (9,3), so (6,3) is 'T', (7,3) is 'T', etc., up to (9,3), and then (9,4) is also 'T' in row 4. So the tail is at (6,3), but the board shows 'T' for all body parts, I think.\n\nAnyway, I don't need to worry about that too much. The important thing is to know where the snakes are.\n\nNow, I need to decide my move for turn 17.\n\nFirst, check my possible moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT from (2,5).\n\n- UP: (2,6)\n- DOWN: (2,4)\n- LEFT: (1,5)\n- RIGHT: (3,5)\n\nNow, check if these moves are safe.\n\n1. Moving to (2,6): Check if it's on the board: yes, x=2 between 0-9, y=6 between 0-9. Check if it's occupied by any snake body or my own body. My body is empty, so no. Enemy snake body: from the list, enemy body is at (9,4),(9,3),(8,3),(7,3),(6,3). So (2,6) is not occupied by enemy body. Also, enemy head is at (9,5), so not there. So (2,6) is safe.\n\n2. Moving to (2,4): On board, yes. Check occupancy: not in my body. Enemy body: (2,4) is not in the list. So safe.\n\n3. Moving to (1,5): On board, yes. Not in my body. Enemy body: (1,5) not in list. So safe.\n\n4. Moving to (3,5): On board, yes. Not in my body. Enemy body: (3,5) not in list. So safe.\n\nSo all four moves are potentially safe from immediate collision.\n\nNow, I need to consider apples. The apples are at: (4,0), (4,8), (5,0), (8,5), (4,2).\n\nFrom my position (2,5), the closest apples are: (4,0), (5,0), (4,2), etc.\n\n(4,0): distance = |4-2| + |0-5| = 2 + 5 = 7\n(5,0): |5-2| + |0-5| = 3 + 5 = 8\n(4,2): |4-2| + |2-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n(4,8): |4-2| + |8-5| = 2 + 3 = 5\n(8,5): |8-2| + |5-5| = 6 + 0 = 6\n\nSo closest are (4,2) and (4,8), both distance 5.\n\nBut (4,2) is at y=2, which is below, and (4,8) is above.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (4,0) and (5,0), which are at the bottom.\n\nNow, I need to think about strategy. I have 0 apples, enemy has 5. So I need to start collecting apples.\n\nBut I also need to avoid dangers.\n\nFirst, what are the potential dangers?\n\n1. Enemy snake #1: its head is at (9,5), and it can move in any direction. Since it's at the edge, it might not move left if it's smart, but I don't know. Also, its body blocks some cells.\n\n2. My own moves: I need to avoid moving into my own tail in the future, but currently, I have no body, so no issue.\n\n3. Collisions: if I move to a cell where the enemy might also move, we could collide.\n\nBut since the enemy's head is far away at (9,5), and my head is at (2,5), the distance is 7 in x-direction. So unless the enemy moves towards me, which is unlikely since it's at the edge, probably it will move to avoid death or to get apples.\n\nLooking at the board, there's an apple at (8,5), which is close to the enemy head (9,5). So the enemy might try to move LEFT to (8,5) to eat that apple.\n\nAlso, the enemy's body is in the way: if it moves LEFT, it would go to (8,5), which might be safe if no one else is there.\n\nBut in the current state, (8,5) has an apple, as per the apples list: (8,5) is an apple. Yes, from the apples: (4,0), (4,8), (5,0), (8,5), (4,2).\n\nSo (8,5) has an apple, and enemy head is at (9,5), so it might move LEFT to eat it.\n\nBut since multiple snakes can move to the same apple, if I also try to go there, we might collide.\n\nBut I'm at (2,5), so to reach (8,5), I need to move right multiple times, which is far.\n\nSo probably, I should focus on closer apples.\n\nNow, considering my possible moves:\n\n- UP to (2,6): this moves me up, closer to (4,8), distance reduces to 4 in x and 2 in y, so Manhattan distance 6? Wait, from (2,6) to (4,8): |4-2| + |8-6| = 2+2=4. Yes, closer.\n\n- DOWN to (2,4): closer to (4,2), distance to (4,2) from (2,4) is |4-2| + |2-4| = 2+2=4. Also, from (2,4) to (4,0) is |4-2| + |0-4| = 2+4=6.\n\n- LEFT to (1,5): moves me left, away from most apples. Apples are mostly on the right side, at x=4,5,8. So moving left might not be good.\n\n- RIGHT to (3,5): moves me closer to x=4,5,8. From (3,5), distance to (4,2) is 1+3=4, to (4,8) is 1+3=4, to (5,0) is 2+5=7, etc.\n\nSo RIGHT seems good to move towards the apples.\n\nAlso, in the last move, I moved LEFT, but according to the rationale, I was at (5,5) and moved LEFT to (4,5), but in the current state, I'm at (2,5). That doesn't make sense. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe the board is 10x10, and coordinates are (x,y), with x from 0 to 9, y from 0 to 9, where (0,0) is bottom left, so y increases upwards.\n\nIn the board display, row 9 is top, row 0 is bottom. So for a given row, the first character is column 0, last is column 9.\n\nSo in row 5: \" . . 0 . . . . . A 1\" which means:\n- col 0: .\n- col 1: .\n- col 2: 0 (my head)\n- col 3: .\n- col 4: .\n- col 5: .\n- col 6: .\n- col 7: .\n- col 8: A (apple)\n- col 9: 1 (enemy head)\n\nSo my head is at (2,5), enemy head at (9,5), apple at (8,5).\n\nBut in the last move rationale, it said I was at (5,5) and moved LEFT. Perhaps it's a typo, and I was actually at (3,5) or something. But I think I should ignore that and focus on the current state.\n\nPerhaps the rationale is from a different turn or mistaken. I'll proceed with current state: my head at (2,5).\n\nNow, back to move choice.\n\nAll moves are safe. I need to choose one that helps me get apples and keeps options open.\n\nMoving LEFT to (1,5) seems less useful, as it moves me away from apples. So probably avoid LEFT.\n\nMoving UP to (2,6): moves me towards (4,8), which is an apple. Also, row 6 is empty according to the board, so I can move freely.\n\nMoving DOWN to (2,4): moves me towards (4,2) and (4,0). (4,2) is an apple, (4,0) is also an apple. But (2,4) is above (2,3), etc.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (3,5): moves me directly towards the apples at x=4,5,8.\n\nNow, consider the enemy. If I move RIGHT to (3,5), I'm moving closer to the center, and if the enemy moves LEFT to (8,5), that's fine, no collision.\n\nBut I also need to think about future moves. If I go RIGHT, I can continue to (4,5), (5,5), etc., and perhaps go down to eat (5,0) or (4,0), or up to (4,8).\n\nFrom (2,5), going RIGHT to (3,5), then to (4,5), which is close to (4,2), (4,0), etc.\n\nSimilarly, going UP to (2,6), then I can go RIGHT to (3,6), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8) to eat the apple there.\n\nGoing DOWN to (2,4), then I can go RIGHT to (3,4), (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) to eat (4,2), or further down to (4,0).\n\nSo all three directions (UP, DOWN, RIGHT) seem promising, while LEFT is less so.\n\nNow, I need to consider which one gives me more options.\n\nAlso, I should avoid potential traps. For example, if I go DOWN to (2,4), and then the enemy might move in a way that blocks me, but that's unlikely since the enemy is far.\n\nAnother thing: there might be other threats, but currently, only one enemy snake.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that after my move, I don't get trapped. For example, if I go to (2,6), I can still go UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT from there. Similarly for other positions.\n\nLet's check each move:\n\n- UP to (2,6): from there, possible moves: UP to (2,7), DOWN to (2,5), LEFT to (1,6), RIGHT to (3,6). All seem open, as per board, row 7 and 6 are empty.\n\n- DOWN to (2,4): possible moves: UP to (2,5), DOWN to (2,3), LEFT to (1,4), RIGHT to (3,4). Check if (2,3) is occupied: in row 3, it says \". . . . . . T T T T\", so at col 2, it's '.', so empty. Similarly, (1,4) in row 4: \". . . . . . . . . T\", so col 1 is '.', empty. (3,4) is empty. So all moves are open.\n\n- RIGHT to (3,5): from there, possible moves: UP to (3,6), DOWN to (3,4), LEFT to (2,5), RIGHT to (4,5). (3,6) is in row 6, which is empty. (3,4) in row 4, empty. (4,5) is empty (from row 5: col 4 is '.'). So all open.\n\n- LEFT to (1,5): possible moves: UP to (1,6), DOWN to (1,4), LEFT to (0,5), RIGHT to (2,5). (0,5) is on board, and from row 5: col 0 is '.', so empty. (1,6) in row 6, empty. (1,4) in row 4, empty. So also open.\n\nSo all moves keep options open.\n\nNow, to prioritize moves that get me closer to apples.\n\nFrom (2,5), the closest apples are (4,2) and (4,8), both Manhattan distance 5.\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (3,5): distance to (4,2) is 4, to (4,8) is 4.\n- Moving UP to (2,6): distance to (4,8) is 4, to (4,2) is 5.\n- Moving DOWN to (2,4): distance to (4,2) is 4, to (4,8) is 6.\n- Moving LEFT to (1,5): distance to (4,2) is 6, to (4,8) is 6, etc.\n\nSo moving RIGHT or UP or DOWN all reduce the distance to some apple by 1.\n\nBut moving RIGHT might be better because it directly approaches the x=4 line, where multiple apples are: (4,0), (4,2), (4,8). From x=4, I can easily go up or down to get the apples.\n\nSimilarly, moving UP or DOWN keeps me at x=2, and then I need to move right later.\n\nAlso, consider that there's an apple at (5,0), which is also accessible from x=4.\n\nMoreover, moving RIGHT to (3,5) puts me directly in line with the apple at (5,0) and (4,0), etc.\n\nWait, (5,0) is at (5,0), so from (3,5), I need to go down and right.\n\nBut perhaps it's fine.\n\nAnother thing: in the last move, I apparently moved LEFT, but since I'm at (2,5) now, and the rationale mentioned (5,5), perhaps there's confusion. But I'll ignore that.\n\nPerhaps I should consider if there's a risk of collision with the enemy.\n\nFor example, if I move RIGHT to (3,5), and the enemy moves LEFT to (8,5), no problem.\n\nBut if the enemy moves UP or DOWN, it might not affect me.\n\nHowever, there's a possibility that the enemy might move towards me if it sees apples, but from (9,5), the closest apple is (8,5), then (4,8), etc., but (4,8) is far.\n\nSo likely, the enemy will go for (8,5) first.\n\nBut to be safe, I should avoid moving directly towards where the enemy might go, but since I'm far, it's ok.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the turn order. Since all snakes move simultaneously, I need to predict where the enemy will be, but I don't know its move.\n\nBut in general, I should assume that the enemy will move to eat apples or avoid death.\n\nNow, looking at the board, for snake #1, at (9,5), possible moves: UP to (9,6), DOWN to (9,4), LEFT to (8,5), RIGHT to (10,5) which is off board, so it can't move RIGHT.\n\nSo it can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT.\n\nIf it goes LEFT to (8,5), it eats the apple and grows.\n\nIf it goes DOWN to (9,4), but (9,4) is its own body (since body includes (9,4)), so moving DOWN would be into its own body, which is death. Wait, is that correct?\n\nThe rules say: \"If your head moves into any snake's body (including your own), you die.\" So if the enemy moves DOWN to (9,4), which is its own body segment, it would die. So probably, it won't do that, unless it's forced.\n\nSimilarly, if it moves UP to (9,6), that's empty, as per board.\n\nSo likely, the enemy will move either LEFT to (8,5) or UP to (9,6). It won't move DOWN because that would be into its own body.\n\nSo possible moves for enemy: LEFT or UP.\n\nIf it moves LEFT, it goes to (8,5), eats the apple, and grows, so its body will now include (8,5), and the tail might move if it doesn't eat an apple every turn, but since it eats, it grows, so the tail might stay or move depending on the game rules. In standard Snake, if you eat an apple, you grow by one segment, so the tail doesn't move that turn. But in this game, it's not specified, but probably similar.\n\nBut for collision, if the enemy moves to (8,5), and if I were to move to (8,5), we would collide and both die. But I'm far from (8,5), so no issue.\n\nNow, back to my move.\n\nI think moving RIGHT is a good choice, as it brings me closer to the apples at x=4 and x=5.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (2,6) towards (4,8) is also good, but (4,8) is at the top, and from there, I might have fewer options if I go too high.\n\nSimilarly, moving DOWN to (2,4) towards (4,2) and (4,0), but (4,0) is at the bottom, which might be a dead end if I go down there.\n\nFor example, if I go to (4,0), I can only go UP or RIGHT, since LEFT is x=3, which is on board, and DOWN is off board. Wait, (4,0) is at bottom, so DOWN is off board, so I can only go UP, LEFT, or RIGHT. But if I go to (4,0), and then there are no apples below, it might be fine.\n\nBut perhaps moving towards the center is better.\n\nAlso, consider that there are two apples at the bottom: (4,0) and (5,0), so going down might allow me to eat both.\n\nFrom (2,4), I can go to (3,4), (4,4), then down to (4,3), (4,2) to eat (4,2), then further down to (4,1), (4,0) to eat (4,0), then right to (5,0) to eat (5,0), etc.\n\nSo that's a possible path.\n\nSimilarly, from (3,5), I can go down to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut from (2,6), to eat (4,8), I can go right to (3,6), (4,6), then up to (4,7), (4,8).\n\nNow, which apple to prioritize? (4,2) is closer in terms of Manhattan distance, but (4,8) is also distance 5, same as (4,2).\n\nBut (4,2) might be easier to get because it's lower, and there's another apple at (4,0) nearby.\n\nAlso, (5,0) is there.\n\nSo perhaps going down is better to get the cluster of apples at the bottom.\n\nOn the other hand, (4,8) is isolated, and there might be fewer dangers there.\n\nBut I think the bottom cluster is more valuable because there are multiple apples close together.\n\nAlso, the enemy is at the top right, so bottom left might be safer.\n\nSo I think moving DOWN to (2,4) is a good choice.\n\nWait, but let's confirm the coordinates.\n\nMy head is at (2,5). Moving DOWN means decreasing y, so to (2,4).\n\nYes.\n\nFrom (2,4), I can then go RIGHT to (3,4), then (4,4), then down to (4,3), (4,2) to eat the apple at (4,2).\n\nThen from there, down to (4,1), (4,0) to eat (4,0), then right to (5,0) to eat (5,0).\n\nThat seems a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,5), moving RIGHT to (3,5), then down to (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (3,0), then right to (4,0), etc., but that's longer to reach (4,0).\n\nFrom (2,5), moving DOWN directly starts the descent.\n\nAlso, moving DOWN might be safer because it's moving away from the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at y=5, same as me, but at x=9. If I move DOWN to y=4, and the enemy moves UP to y=6 or LEFT to x=8, then the distance increases.\n\nSo yes.\n\nMoreover, in the last move, I moved LEFT, which was towards the left, perhaps to avoid something, but now I need to change direction.\n\nBut since the rationale might be mistaken, I'll ignore it.\n\nSo I think I'll go with DOWN.\n\nBut wait, let's check if moving DOWN is indeed safe.\n\nFrom (2,5) to (2,4): is (2,4) occupied?\n\nFrom the board, row 4: \". . . . . . . . . T\" so at col 2, it's '.', empty. So yes.\n\nAlso, no enemy body there.\n\nSo safe.\n\nNow, for the next turn, I need to have a plan.\n\nSo my long-term plan: move down to (2,4), then right to (3,4), (4,4), then down to (4,3), (4,2) to eat (4,2), then further down to eat (4,0) and (5,0).\n\nBut I need to write this in the rationale.\n\nWait, the instructions say: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo I need to write my plan before the move.\n\nAlso, the final line must be the move.\n\nSo for now, I'll write:\n\nPlan: Move DOWN towards the apple cluster at (4,0), (4,2), (5,0). From (2,4), proceed right to (3,4), (4,4), then down to (4,2) to eat the first apple.\n\nThen the move: DOWN\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that this plan is feasible and safe.\n\nAlso, I should consider that other snakes might move, but I can't control that.\n\nAnother thing: when I eat an apple, I grow, so my body will increase, which might block my path later if I'm not careful. But since I have no body now, when I eat, I'll have a tail, but it shouldn't be a problem if I plan properly.\n\nFor example, if I eat an apple at (4,2), then my body will be at (4,2) - head, and previous positions, but since I'm moving, the tail will lag behind.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm planning to move in a path, it should be fine.\n\nI think it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, I could move RIGHT first, but I think DOWN is better to start the descent.\n\nWait, another thought: if I move DOWN to (2,4), then from there, I can go RIGHT to (3,4), (4,4), and then I have options: down to (4,3), (4,2), or up to (4,5), etc.\n\nWhereas if I move RIGHT to (3,5), I can go DOWN to (3,4), etc.\n\nBut moving DOWN first keeps me at x=2, which might be safer if the enemy moves left, but the enemy is far, so probably not necessary.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT to (3,5) puts me closer to the center, which might have more opportunities.\n\nBut I think both are fine. Perhaps I'll choose DOWN.\n\nWait, let's see the apples again: (4,2) is at (4,2), which is not directly below (2,5); to reach it, I need to go right and down.\n\nFrom (2,5), moving DOWN to (2,4), then I can go RIGHT to (3,4), (4,4), then DOWN to (4,3), (4,2). That's three moves after this one to reach (4,2).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,5), then I can go DOWN to (3,4), (3,3), (3,2), (3,1), (3,0), then RIGHT to (4,0), but that's longer to reach the bottom apples.\n\nWait, from (3,5) to (3,4) is one move down, then to (3,3), etc., to (3,0), which is 4 moves down, then right to (4,0), so total 5 moves to reach (4,0), whereas from (2,5) to (2,4) to (3,4) to (4,4) to (4,3) to (4,2) is 4 moves to reach (4,2), which is an apple.\n\nSo similar.\n\nBut perhaps moving DOWN first is fine.\n\nAlternatively, I could move RIGHT to (3,5), and then next turn move DOWN to (3,4), and so on.\n\nBut I think either way.\n\nWait, another idea: since there's an apple at (4,2), and another at (4,0), and (5,0), it might be efficient to go to x=4 first.\n\nSo from (2,5), moving RIGHT to (3,5), then next turn RIGHT to (4,5), then from there, I can go DOWN to (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) to eat (4,2), then further down to (4,1), (4,0), etc.\n\nFrom (4,5), I can also go UP to (4,8) if I want, but (4,8) is far in y.\n\nSo perhaps moving RIGHT is better to reach x=4 quickly.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distance to the apples after the move.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,5):\n\n- To (4,2): distance 4\n\n- To (4,8): distance 4\n\n- To (5,0): distance 5\n\n- To (4,0): distance 5\n\nIf I move DOWN to (2,4):\n\n- To (4,2): distance 4\n\n- To (4,8): distance 6\n\n- To (5,0): distance 6\n\n- To (4,0): distance 5\n\nSo moving RIGHT keeps me closer to more apples: (4,2), (4,8), (5,0), (4,0) all within 5, while moving DOWN makes (4,8) and (5,0) farther.\n\nSo moving RIGHT is better in terms of accessing multiple apples.\n\nMoreover, from (3,5), I can easily go to (4,5), which is near the center, and then choose to go up or down.\n\nWhereas from (2,4), I'm more committed to going right and then down.\n\nSo I think moving RIGHT is a better choice.\n\nAlso, in the last move, I moved LEFT, perhaps to avoid something, but now I can correct course.\n\nSo I'll go with RIGHT.\n\nNow, for the plan: from (3,5), I plan to go to (4,5) next turn, then decide whether to go up or down based on the situation, but likely down to eat (4,2) and then (4,0) and (5,0).\n\nBut since I don't know the future moves, I'll keep it general.\n\nSo my rationale: My head is at (2,5). I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. All moves are safe from immediate collision. Moving LEFT takes me away from the apples, so I avoid it. Moving UP or DOWN moves me towards the apples at (4,8) or (4,2), but moving RIGHT to (3,5) brings me closer to the central apples at (4,0), (4,2), (4,8), and (5,0), keeping multiple options open. From (3,5), I can proceed to (4,5) and then descend to eat the bottom apples or ascend to eat (4,8). This strategy allows me to reach multiple apples efficiently while maintaining flexibility.\n\nPlan: Move to (3,5), then to (4,5), and from there, based on the board state, likely descend to collect the cluster of apples at the bottom: (4,2), (4,0), and (5,0).\n\nThen the move: RIGHT\n\nWait, but the instructions say: \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\" And \"the final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\n\nSo I need to write the plan first, then the move.\n\nAlso, \"Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.\" So in the plan, I can mention future directions, but after the move word, nothing.\n\nSo I'll write:\n\nMy current position is (2,5). Moving RIGHT to (3,5) brings me closer to the apples at x=4 and x=5, such as (4,2), (4,0), and (5,0). This allows me to reach multiple apples efficiently. From there, I can proceed to (4,5) and then choose to go up or down based on the situation, but likely descend to eat the bottom cluster. This move keeps my options open and avoids moving away from the apples.\n\nPlan: Move towards the central apples, starting with RIGHT to (3,5), then to (4,5), and from there, likely down to (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) to eat the apple at (4,2), then further down to (4,0) and (5,0).\n\nRIGHT\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure the plan is short. The instructions say \"short long-term plan\", so perhaps I can make it more concise.\n\nAlso, I should not write too much.\n\nLet me try to make it shorter.\n\nRationale: Moving RIGHT to (3,5) to approach the apples at (4,0), (4,2), and (5,0). From (3,5), I can go to (4,5) and then down to eat the bottom apples. This is better than moving up or down first, as it keeps options open and reduces distance to multiple apples.\n\nPlan: From (3,5), go to (4,5), then down to (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) to eat (4,2), then to (4,0) and (5,0).\n\nThen move: RIGHT\n\nYes.\n\nNow, I think that's fine.\n\nSo I'll go with thatMoving RIGHT to (3,5) to approach the apples at (4,0), (4,2), and (5,0). From (3,5), I can proceed to (4,5) and then descend to eat the bottom cluster of apples. This move brings me closer to multiple apples while keeping future options open, unlike moving LEFT away from apples or moving UP/DOWN which commits to one direction sooner.\nPlan: From (3,5), move to (4,5) next turn, then down to (4,4), (4,3), (4,2) to eat apple at (4,2), then continue down to (4,0) and (5,0) to collect remaining apples.\nRIGHT",

Keeps me away from the enemy.\n\n**Strategic Consideration & Enemy Prediction**\nThe enemy snake is currently at (5, 4). Its body occupies (6, 4) to (9, 4) and (9, 5). The space \"North\" of the enemy (y > 4) is mostly clear for a few steps.\nAssuming the enemy is playing optimally to catch up (it has 6 apples vs my 1), it likely wants to eat the apples near the top of the board, such as the one at (8, 9).\nIf the enemy moves UP to (5, 5) this turn, it stays alive and opens up a path to the top.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (4, 4), it might be trying to get to the bottom apples or cut me off.\n\nIf I move UP to (4, 9):\n- I am safe this turn.\n- Next turn, if the enemy moves UP, we might engage in a chase on the top row. If I stay at (4, 8/9) and the enemy comes up (e.g., to (6,5)...), I am effectively cornering myself against the top wall.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (3, 8):\n- I gain distance from the enemy's y-level.\n- I keep options open to go DOWN towards the cluster at (3,2) or (4,2).\n- This seems safer and more flexible than UP.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 8):\n- Similar to LEFT, but I am moving towards the x-coordinate of the enemy (5). The enemy is at x=5. If it moves UP, it stays at x=5. It is slightly riskier to be at the same x as the enemy.\n\n**Conclusion**\n**DOWN** is fatal (hits self).\n**UP** is safe but limits movement next turn and moves away from the main apple cluster.\n**RIGHT** is okay but puts me on the same x-axis as the enemy, which is slightly riskier than **LEFT**.\n**LEFT** moves me away from the enemy, towards a cluster of apples, and keeps multiple paths open (down or left).\n\nI will move **LEFT**.\n\nLEFT",

This is fatal.\n    - **Result:** Eliminated immediately.\n- **UP:** Moves to (3, 9).\n    - **Safety:** Valid coordinate. Empty.\n    - **Future:** Puts me on the top wall. This limits my movement options (only Down, Left, Right available next turn). While safe now, it corners me against the wall, making it harder to escape or maneuver if the enemy approaches from below later.\n- **DOWN:** Moves to (3, 7).\n    - **Safety:** Valid coordinate. Empty.\n    - **Future:** Moves me closer to the bottom apples (distance to (3,2) decreases to 5). However, the enemy snake (Head at (5,4)) is also likely targeting those bottom apples (at (4,0), (5,0)). Engaging in a race to the bottom apples against a larger, closer snake is risky.\n\n**Strategic Consideration**\nI have survived 23 turns, but I only have 1 apple. The enemy has 6 apples. I need to start scoring to catch up.\nThe apple at (8, 9) is a high-value target because it is currently isolated and requires a horizontal move (Right) to reach, keeping me away from the enemy's vertical approach vector.\nHowever, I am currently at (3, 8). To reach (8, 9), I need to move Right eventually.\nWhy am I considering **LEFT**?\nThe enemy is at (5, 4) and likely moving towards the bottom apples (4,0)/(5,0). If I go DOWN towards the bottom, I risk conflict. If I stay put or go UP, I am not immediately gaining points.\n**LEFT** (to 2, 8) moves me horizontally away from the enemy (x=5). This secures my safety for the next turn. From (2, 8), I can easily maneuver towards the (8, 9) apple or, if the enemy ignores the top, I can eventually loop down.\n**RIGHT** is fatal.\n**UP** restricts me to the wall.\n**DOWN** enters the \"danger zone\" where the enemy is likely moving.\n\nTherefore, **LEFT** is the safest move that keeps my options open. It allows me to assess the enemy's next move. If the enemy goes Bottom, I can go Right to chase the Top apple. If the enemy comes Top, I am already moving away/setting up.\n\n**Plan:** Move Left to (2,8) to evade the enemy's likely vertical descent. Next turn, pivot Right towards (8,9).\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

If I go DOWN, I engage in a race for the (3,2) and (4,2) apples.\n\n**Strategic Consideration**\nI need to catch up to Snake #1 (1 apple vs 6 apples). I need to secure apples safely.\n- **RIGHT** is fatal.\n- **UP** is safe but restrictive. It moves me away from most apples, making it harder to score later.\n- **LEFT** is safe but moves me further away from the (8,9) apple (distance becomes 7) and the bottom clusters.\n- **DOWN** is safe and moves me towards the (3,2) and (4,2) apples (distance becomes 5).\n\nComparing **DOWN** to **LEFT** and **UP**:\n- **DOWN** offers the shortest path to scoring points. The apples at (3,2) and (4,2) are adjacent to each other, offering a potential double-point turn if I can navigate safely.\n- The enemy is at (4,3). They are adjacent to the (4,2) apple. If the enemy moves DOWN to (4,2), they will eat an apple and grow. If I move DOWN to (2,7), I am setting up to compete for the remaining apple at (3,2) or to flank the enemy.\n- However, staying at (2,8) or moving to (1,8) or (2,9) delays scoring. With a score of 1-6, delay is risky. I need points.\n- By moving **DOWN**, I force the enemy to react. If they go for the bottom apples, I have a clear shot at the middle apples. If they stay in the middle, I can adjust. Moving DOWN brings me into the \"action\" zone.\n\n**Plan:** Move **DOWN** to (2, 7). This is the most direct route to the closest apple cluster ((3,2)/(4,2)). I need to start scoring to catch up. I will watch the enemy's move closely to ensure I don't run into their body or attempt a head-on collision if they also move Down/Left.\n\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

Length is 1.\n*   **Apples:** The cluster at (3, 2) and (4, 2) is now the primary target. (4, 0) and (5, 0) are also reachable but further south. (8, 9) is far north.\n*   **Enemy (Snake #1):** Head at (4, 2). Body at [(4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5)].\n    *   *Crucial Observation:* The enemy is currently standing on the apple at (4, 2). If they stay there or move to an invalid cell (like (4, 1) if it's not an apple? No, (4,1) is empty), they will eventually grow. However, if they stay on (4, 2), they effectively block that apple unless they move off it. Wait, if they are on (4, 2), they eat the apple. They gain a point and a tail segment. The apple respawns. So they are *likely* to eat the apple this turn. But we need to check if they are trapped or forced to move elsewhere.\n    *   Enemy head at (4, 2). Surrounding cells: (4, 3) is their own body. (5, 2) is empty. (3, 2) is an apple. (4, 1) is empty. They have valid moves.\n\n**Evaluating Moves from (2, 7)**\n*   **UP:** Moves to (2, 8). This is currently my body. **Death.**\n*   **LEFT:** Moves to (1, 7). Empty.\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Position:* Moves towards the left wall. Distance to nearest apple (3,2) increases to ~5.5. Not ideal for chasing.\n*   **RIGHT:** Moves to (3, 7). Empty.\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Position:* Moves closer to the center. Distance to (3,2) is 5 (vertical). Distance to (8,9) is 6.5.\n*   **DOWN:** Moves to (2, 6). Empty.\n    *   *Safety:* Safe.\n    *   *Position:* Moves towards the bottom cluster (4,0), (5,0). Distance to (3,2) becomes 5. Distance to (4,0) becomes 6.\n\n**Strategic Consideration**\nI am at (2, 7). The enemy is at (4, 2). The enemy is likely to eat the apple at (4, 2) or the one at (3, 2) this turn. They are South of me.\n*   If I go **DOWN**, I move towards the bottom apples. The enemy is currently blocking the direct path to the (3,2)/(4,2) cluster. If I continue South, I might race them for the (4,0)/(5,0) apples.\n*   If I go **RIGHT**, I move towards the center. This is a balanced move.\n*   If I go **LEFT**, I move away from the action.\n\nHowever, looking closely at the enemy's body:\n*   Enemy head (4, 2).\n*   Body: (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5).\n*   The enemy is somewhat constrained. They might move to (3, 2) or (4, 1) or (5, 2).\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (2, 6):\n*   I get closer to the bottom.\n*   Next turn, I could go LEFT to (1, 6), DOWN to (2, 5), or RIGHT to (3, 6).\n*   From (2, 6), the apple at (3, 2) is 5 units away (diagonal blocked, so L-D-D-D-D).\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (3, 7):\n*   I get closer to the center.\n*   From (3, 7), I have good access to the top right and the center.\n\nLet's look at the bottom apples (4, 0) and (5, 0).\nMy position (2, 7). Distance to (4, 0) is `|2-4| + |7-0| = 2 + 7 = 9`.\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 6): Distance becomes `|2-4| + |6-0| = 2 + 6 = 8`.\nIf I go DOWN again to (2, 5): `2 + 5 = 7`.\nI can reach the bottom apples in roughly 8 turns (allowing for pathing).\n\nThe enemy is at (4, 2).\nDistance to (4, 0) is `0 + 2 = 2`.\nDistance to (5, 0) is `1 + 2 = 3`.\nThe enemy is *much* closer to the bottom apples than I am. They can get there in 2-3 turns.\n\nTherefore, racing the enemy to the bottom apples (4,0), (5,0) is a losing strategy. They are closer and have a longer body (8 segments) so they can block me.\n\nMy best chance is to secure the apples that are *away* from the enemy or that the enemy is currently moving away from.\nThe enemy is at (4, 2). The apples at (3, 2) and (4, 2) are right next to them. The apple at (8, 9) is far away.\n\nWait, let's reconsider the \"trap\" logic.\nThe enemy is at (4, 2).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (4, 1), they eat nothing (board shows A at 0,2,3,4? No, 4,0 is A. 4,1 is empty). Or they could move DOWN-DOWN-DOWN...\nBut they are probably going for the apples.\n\nLet's look at the move **RIGHT** to (3, 7).\nThis puts me at (3, 7).\nFrom (3, 7), I can go DOWN to (3, 6).\nFrom (3, 6), I can go LEFT to (2, 6), DOWN to (3, 5), or RIGHT to (4, 6).\n\nLet's look at the move **DOWN** to (2, 6).\nFrom (2, 6), I can go DOWN to (2, 5).\nFrom (2, 5), I can go DOWN to (2, 4).\nWait, (2, 4) is empty.\nFrom (2, 4), I can go DOWN to (2, 3).\nFrom (2, 3), I can go DOWN to (2, 2).\nFrom (2, 2), I can go RIGHT to (3, 2) to eat the apple.\n\nThis path `DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT` is a straight line of 5 moves to reach the apple at (3, 2).\nThis is very predictable.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (3, 7):\n`RIGHT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT` -> (3, 2). 6 moves.\n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (1, 7):\n`LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT` -> (3, 2). 6 moves.\n\nThe **DOWN** move gets me to the (3, 2) apple faster (in 5 turns) than any other direction, provided the path remains clear.\n\nHowever, the enemy is at (4, 2).\nIf the enemy moves UP to (4, 3) -> death (body).\nIf enemy moves LEFT to (3, 2) -> eats apple, grows.\nIf enemy moves RIGHT to (5, 2) -> safe?\nIf enemy moves DOWN to (4, 1) -> safe?\n\nIf the enemy moves **DOWN** to (4, 1), their tail moves to (4, 2) (assuming they haven't grown this turn... wait, they haven't eaten an apple *this turn* yet, unless they are already standing on one). Standing on (4, 2) *is* an apple. So they eat it. They grow. Their tail stays where it is (8, 5). The new tail segment is added behind (8, 5).\nSo, if they eat (4, 2), their body becomes: Head (4, 2), Body (4, 3), ..., (8, 5), (8, 5) (new tail).\n\nIf they move **LEFT** to (3, 2), they eat that apple.\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (2, 6):\nI am safe.\nI am setting up a \"trap\" or a blockade.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN (towards the bottom), they will be on the far right of the board relative to me (x=4), while I am at x=2.\nIf the enemy moves LEFT (to 3,2), they block that apple.\n\nIs there a move that offers a \"double\" apple opportunity?\nThe apples at (4, 0) and (5, 0) are adjacent.\nThe apples at (3, 2) and (4, 2) are adjacent.\nThe apples at (8, 9) is alone.\n\nThe enemy is currently right next to the (3, 2) and (4, 2) cluster.\nIt is dangerous to enter that cluster while the enemy is there.\n\nWhat about the apples at (4, 0) and (5, 0)?\nPath from (2, 7) -> (2, 6) -> (2, 5) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 1) -> (4, 0).\nThis path is blocked by the enemy currently (at 4, 2).\nHowever, the enemy might move.\n\nLet's look at the move **DOWN**.\nIt puts me at (2, 6).\nFrom (2, 6), I have options: LEFT (1,6), DOWN (2,5), RIGHT (3,6).\n(2, 5) is empty.\n(3, 6) is empty.\n(1, 6) is empty.\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (1, 7):\n(1, 6) is empty.\n(0, 7) is a wall.\n(1, 8) is empty.\n(2, 7) is empty (as I leave it).\nThis is slightly more restrictive.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (3, 7):\n(3, 6) is empty.\n(4, 6) is empty.\n(3, 8) is empty.\n(2, 7) is empty.\nThis offers good mobility.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"race\" to the bottom.\nThe enemy is at (4, 2). Distance to (4, 0) is 2.\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 6), I am distance 8 from (4, 0).\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 5), distance 7.\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 4), distance 6.\nI can't beat the enemy to the bottom apples *unless* the enemy chooses not to go there.\n\nThe enemy has 7 apples. I have 1. I need to play aggressively but safely.\nThe enemy is currently at (4, 2). They are likely to move DOWN to (4, 1) to prepare for (4, 0), or LEFT to (3, 2), or RIGHT to (5, 2).\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (2, 6):\nI am safe.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (4, 1):\nNext turn, the enemy is at (4, 1). I am at (2, 6).\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (3, 2):\nThey eat the apple. They grow.\nIf the enemy moves UP... they die (body at 4,3).\n\nThe move **DOWN** seems to be the only move that doesn't immediately run into a wall or my own body.\nIt increases the distance from the enemy.\n\nWait, look at the enemy's body again.\nHead (4, 2).\nBody: (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5).\nThis looks like the enemy might be stuck in a loop or just exited a tight spot.\nIf the enemy is at (4, 2) and the body is at (4, 3), they can't go UP.\nThey can go LEFT (3, 2), RIGHT (5, 2), DOWN (4, 1).\nIf they go DOWN, they enter the open space towards the bottom.\n\nLet's look at the board again.\nRow 2: `. . . A 1 . . . . .`\nRow 3: `. . . . T . . A . .`\nRow 4: `. . . . T T T T . .`\n\nWait, the board state provided:\nRow 2: `. . . A 1 . . . . .`\nRow 3: `. . . . T . . A . .`\nRow 4: `. . . . T T T T . .`\n\nWait, Snake #1 body includes (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5).\nThe board shows 'T' (tail?) or '1' (snake ID?) or 'A' (apple).\nThe text says \"Snake #1 - Head: (4, 2)\".\nBut the board shows:\nRow 2: `. . . A 1 . . . . .` at x=4.\nRow 3: `. . . . T . . A . .` at x=4.\nRow 4: `. . . . T T T T . .` at x=4,5,6,7.\n\nThere is a discrepancy between the text description of Snake #1 and the board map.\nText: \"Snake #1 - Head: (4, 2), Body: [(4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5), (8, 5)]\"\nMap:\nRow 2 (y=2): `(4,2)` is `1`. So Snake #1 is at (4,2). Consistent.\nRow 3 (y=3): `(4,3)` is `T`. Consistent with body (4,3).\nRow 4 (y=4): `(4,4)` is `T`. Consistent. (5,4) is `T`. Consistent. (6,4) is `T`. Consistent. (7,4) is `T`. Consistent.\nSo the map and text are consistent.\n\nNow, where are the other snakes?\nMy head: (2, 7). Map shows `(2,7)` as `0`. Consistent.\nMy body: [(2, 8)]. Map shows `(2,8)` as `T` (Tail). Consistent.\n\nOkay, the map is just representing the *current* state with '0' for my head, '1' for enemy head, and 'T' for tails/bodies.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the \"blockade\" potential.\nIf I move **DOWN** to (2, 6):\nMy potential path: (2, 6) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 2) -> (3, 2).\nThis path is very close to the enemy's body.\n(2, 4) is above (4, 4)? No, (2, 4) is left of (4, 4).\nThe enemy is at (4, 2), body at (4, 3), (4, 4).\nIf I am at (2, 4), I am safe from them horizontally.\nHowever, if the enemy moves DOWN to (4, 1), (4, 0), (3, 0), etc., they will be competing for the (4, 0), (5, 0) apples.\n\nLet's check the distance to the apples again.\n(3, 2): Distance from (2, 7) is 6.\n(4, 2): Distance from (2, 7) is 7.\n(4, 0): Distance from (2, 7) is 9.\n(5, 0): Distance from (2, 7) is 10.\n(8, 9): Distance from (2, 7) is 9.\n\nClosest is (3, 2).\nHowever, the enemy is AT (4, 2) or adjacent to it.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN or RIGHT or LEFT, they might leave the area.\n\nIf I move **DOWN**:\nI get closer to the bottom.\nIf I move **UP**:\nI hit the wall at (2, 9). This limits options.\nIf I move **LEFT**:\nI hit the wall at (0, 7) eventually.\nIf I move **RIGHT**:\nI move towards the center. This gives me access to the bottom apples and the top right apple.\n\nLet's think about the \"Open Area\".\nTop Left: (0,9) to (2,6) is mostly open.\nTop Right: (6,9) to (9,9) has the (8,9) apple.\nBottom Right: (6,0) to (9,0) is open.\nBottom Left: (0,0) to (5,0) has apples.\n\nI am at (2, 7).\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 7):\nI am closer to the vertical line x=3/4.\nI can access (3, 2) or (8, 9).\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 6):\nI am closer to the bottom apples.\n\nThe enemy is at (4, 2).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN (towards 4,0), they will be very dangerous for me if I go for the bottom apples.\nIf the enemy moves UP (impossible) or LEFT (to 3,2), they might block the path to the middle apples.\nIf the enemy moves RIGHT (to 5,2), they move away from the apples at (3,2) and (4,2).\n\nConsider the move **DOWN**.\nWhy? Because it forces the enemy to make a decision.\nIf I go DOWN, I threaten the bottom cluster.\nIf the enemy goes DOWN to (4,1), they can't catch me immediately, but they can block me.\nIf the enemy goes LEFT to (3,2), they eat the apple.\nIf the enemy goes RIGHT to (5,2), they lose position.\n\nWait, if the enemy goes LEFT to (3,2):\nThey eat the apple. Their tail extends.\nNow, if I am at (2, 6), I am safe.\nNext turn, the enemy is at (3, 2). Body extends to (4, 2).\nI can then go DOWN to (2, 5).\nThis keeps me safe.\n\nIs there any move that *guarantees* an apple?\nNo. The enemy is too close.\n\nIs there a move that *blocks* the enemy?\nIf I move **RIGHT** to (3, 7), I don't block them.\nIf I move **DOWN** to (2, 6), I don't block them.\n\nLet's look at the move **LEFT** to (1, 7).\nIf I go LEFT, I move away from the enemy.\nThe enemy is at (4, 2).\nIf the enemy goes LEFT to (3, 2), they are still far from me (x=3 vs x=1).\nIf the enemy goes DOWN to (4, 1), they are far.\nThis seems safe, but it delays scoring.\n\nI need to catch up (1 vs 7).\nDelay is bad.\n\nLet's look at the board state again.\nRow 2: `. . . A 1 . . . . .`\nRow 3: `. . . . T . . A . .`\nRow 4: `. . . . T T T T . .`\n\nWait, look at the apples at (4, 0) and (5, 0).\nThey are adjacent.\nAnd they are adjacent to *empty* cells (5,1) and (4,1) and (6,0) etc.\nThe enemy is at (4, 2).\nIf the enemy goes DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, they can eat (4, 0) and (5, 0) very quickly.\nI should NOT race them for (4,0)/(5,0).\n\nThe enemy is at (4, 2).\nThe apples at (3, 2) and (4, 2) are right there.\nIf the enemy eats them, they will grow.\nIf I move **DOWN**, I am moving away from these apples.\nIf I move **RIGHT**, I am moving away from these apples.\n\nIf I move **UP**, I am moving away from ALL apples except (8,9).\n\nIf I move **LEFT**, I am moving away from (4,0) and (8,9).\n\nSo, which direction offers the best *future* apples that are NOT contested by the enemy?\nThe bottom left apples (4,0) are contested.\nThe middle apples (3,2), (4,2) are contested.\nThe top right apple (8,9) is contested? The enemy is far away (at 4,2).\nDistance from enemy to (8,9): |4-8| + |2-9| = 4 + 7 = 11.\nDistance from me (2,7) to (8,9): 6 + 2 = 8.\nIf I go UP, I reduce the distance to (8,9).\n\nIf I go UP to (2, 8):\nI am at (2, 8).\nFrom there, I can go RIGHT to (3, 8), then UP to (3, 9), then RIGHT... to (8, 9).\nPath: (2,7)->(2,8)->(3,8)->(3,9)->(4,9)->(5,9)->(6,9)->(7,9)->(8,9).\nThis is a clear path along the top wall.\nThe enemy cannot intercept me easily because they are far South.\n\nLet's verify safety of going UP.\n(2, 8). Is it empty?\nMap Row 8: `. . T . . . . . . .`\n(2, 8) is `T`. This is *my own body*.\nMy body is currently [(2, 8)].\nSo I cannot go UP.\n\nOkay, so UP is out.\nMy body is at (2, 8). I am at (2, 7).\nSo I cannot go UP.\n\nRemaining moves: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (1, 7):\nMap: (1, 7) is `.`.\nSafe.\nFuture: (1, 7) -> (1, 6) -> ... -> (0, 6).\nThis path leads to the top-left corner.\nAre there apples there? No.\nThe only apple in the top half is (8, 9).\nGoing LEFT takes me away from (8, 9).\nDistance to (8, 9) becomes 9.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 7):\nMap: (3, 7) is `.`.\nSafe.\nFuture: Towards the center and top-right.\nDistance to (8, 9) becomes 7.\nDistance to (4, 0) becomes 8.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 6):\nMap: (2, 6) is `.`.\nSafe.\nFuture: Towards the bottom.\nDistance to (4, 0) becomes 8.\nDistance to (8, 9) becomes 9.\n\nSo, LEFT and DOWN are \"away\" from the main cluster (8,9).\nRIGHT is \"towards\" the main cluster (8,9).\n\nHowever, I am also competing for the middle/bottom apples.\nThe enemy is at (4, 2).\nIf the enemy moves DOWN, they go for (4, 0).\nIf the enemy moves LEFT or RIGHT, they might go for (3, 2) or (5, 2).\n\nLet's assume the enemy goes for the closest apple.\nClosest apple to (4, 2) is (4, 2) itself (which they are standing on, so they eat it) and (3, 2).\nIf they eat (4, 2), they grow.\nIf they eat (3, 2), they grow.\n\nIf the enemy eats the middle apples, the bottom apples (4,0), (5, 0) become the next target.\nI am at (2, 7).\nIf I go DOWN, I move towards (4, 0).\nIf I go RIGHT, I move towards the center, then can pivot down.\n\nIf the enemy eats the middle apples, they will likely move DOWN towards the bottom apples eventually.\nI should try to secure the bottom apples.\nTo get the bottom apples (4, 0), (5, 0), I need to go DOWN.\n\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 6):\nI am on the path to the bottom.\nI can go (2, 6) -> (2, 5) -> (3, 4) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 2) -> (4, 1) -> (4, 0).\nWait, (4, 2) will be eaten by the enemy this turn.\nNext turn, (4, 2) will be empty (if enemy moves off) or occupied by enemy body.\nIf the enemy moves DOWN to (4, 1), their body will be at (4, 2).\nSo I can't go through (4, 2).\n\nI need to go around.\n(2, 6) -> (3, 6) -> (4, 5) -> (4, 4) -> (4, 3) -> (4, 2).\nBut (4, 4), (4, 3) are enemy body.\nSo I can't go that way.\n\nI need to go:\n(2, 6) -> (3, 5) -> (4, 4) -> (blocked).\n(2, 6) -> (3, 5) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 2).\n(3, 2) is an apple.\nThe enemy is at (4, 2). They might move to (3, 2).\n\nLet's look at the move **RIGHT** to (3, 7).\nFrom (3, 7):\n(3, 6) -> (3, 5) -> (3, 4) -> (3, 3) -> (3, 2).\nSame path logic applies.\n\nThe key is the enemy at (4, 2).\nIf the enemy moves **LEFT** to (3, 2), they eat the apple.\nIf I am at (2, 6) or (3, 7), I can't get (3, 2) this turn.\n\nIf the enemy moves **DOWN** to (4, 1), they don't eat an apple immediately (board shows A at 4,0, 5,0, 3,2, 4,2, 8,9).\nWait, (4, 2) is an apple. So if they are AT (4, 2), they eat it.\nSo they *will* eat an apple this turn unless they move UP (die) or LEFT/RIGHT/DOWN.\nIf they move DOWN, they leave (4, 2) (now eaten) and go to (4, 1).\nIf they move LEFT, they go to (3, 2) (which is an apple).\nIf they move RIGHT, they go to (5, 2) (empty).\n\nIf the enemy moves **LEFT** to (3, 2):\nThey eat the apple at (3, 2).\nNow they have 8 apples.\nI am still at 1.\nI am at (2, 7).\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 6), I am safe.\nNext turn, the enemy is at (3, 2). Body includes (4, 2).\nI can then go DOWN to (2, 5).\nI am still safe.\n\nIf the enemy moves **DOWN** to (4, 1):\nThey eat the apple at (4, 2) (since they are standing on it).\nThey grow.\nI go DOWN to (2, 6).\nNext turn, enemy at (4, 1).\nI am at (2, 6).\nI am safe.\n\nIf the enemy moves **RIGHT** to (5, 2):\nThey eat the apple at (4, 2) (standing on it).\nThey grow.\nI go DOWN to (2, 6).\nNext turn, enemy at (5, 2).\nI am at (2, 6).\n\nSo, no matter what the enemy does (LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT), if I go DOWN, I am safe.\n\nNow, compare **DOWN** vs **RIGHT** vs **LEFT**.\n**DOWN (2, 6):**\n- Moves towards (4, 0), (5, 0).\n- Moves away from (8, 9).\n- Safe.\n\n**RIGHT (3, 7):**\n- Moves towards (8, 9).\n- Moves towards (3, 2) (indirectly).\n- Safe.\n\n**LEFT (1, 7):**\n- Moves towards (0, 7).\n- Safe.\n\nI need to catch up.\nIf I ignore the bottom apples, I rely on (8, 9).\n(8, 9) is far.\nThe enemy is far from (8, 9).\nThe enemy is close to (4, 0), (5, 0).\nIf I go DOWN, I might be able to sneak in and eat (4, 0) or (5, 0) if the enemy goes for the middle apples.\nIf I go RIGHT, I am committing to the long trek to (8, 9).\n\nLet's assume the enemy goes for the easy points.\nThe enemy is at (4, 2).\nThe apples at (3, 2) and (4, 2) are right there.\nIt is logical for the enemy to eat these apples.\nIf the enemy eats (4, 2) (by staying, or moving off and back?), no, if they move, they leave the apple.\nIf they stay at (4, 2), they eat the apple. But they must move. They can't stay.\nSo they must move to a neighbor.\nIf they move DOWN, they eat (4, 2).\nIf they move LEFT, they eat (3, 2).\nIf they move RIGHT, they eat (4, 2).\nSo they will eat an apple this turn.\n\nIf the enemy eats the middle apples, the bottom apples become the next target.\nIf I go DOWN now, I position myself to race for the bottom apples.\nThe enemy will be at (4, 1) or (3, 2) or (5, 2).\nFrom (4, 1), they can reach (4, 0) in 1 move.\nFrom (3, 2), they can reach (4, 0) in 2 moves (diagonal blocked -> L-D-D).\nFrom (5, 2), they can reach (5, 0) in 2 moves (D-D).\n\nIf I am at (2, 6):\nI can reach (4, 0) in roughly 4 moves.\nThe enemy can reach it in 1-2 moves.\nSo I cannot win the race.\n\nTherefore, going DOWN is bad because I will lose the race for the bottom apples.\nI should avoid the bottom apples and go for the top apple (8, 9).\nThe enemy is far away from (8, 9).\nThe path to (8, 9) requires me to go RIGHT or UP.\nI cannot go UP (body).\nSo I should go RIGHT.\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (3, 7):\nI am at (3, 7).\nFrom there, I can go UP to (3, 8), then (3, 9), then right along the top.\nPath: (3,7)->(3,8)->(3,9)->(4,9)->(5,9)->(6,9)->(7,9)->(8,9).\nI can reach (8, 9) in 5 moves (3,7->3,8->3,9->...->8,9).\nThe enemy is at (4, 2). Distance is huge.\n\nIf I go **LEFT** to (1, 7):\nPath: (1,7)->(1,8)->(2,9)->(3,9)->...->(8,9). Longer.\n\nSo **RIGHT** is the best move to secure the (8, 9) apple safely and without competition.\nThe enemy is occupied with the cluster at (3,2), (4,2), (4,0), (5,0).\nLet them fight over those.\nI will take the lonely apple at (8, 9).\n\nIs (3, 7) safe?\nYes, it's empty.\nIs the path safe?\n(3, 8) is empty?\nMap Row 8: `. .

It moves me towards the uncontested apple at (8, 9).\n\nWait, I should double check if (8, 9) is indeed uncontested.\nEnemy at (4, 2).\nDistance to (8, 9) = |4-8| + |2-9| = 4 + 7 = 11.\nMy distance = 8.\nI have 3 turns head start (roughly).\nSince the enemy has more apples, I need to score.\nThe middle apples are dangerous.\nThe bottom apples are dangerous (enemy is closer).\nThe top apple is safe.\n\nLet's confirm the board again.\nRow 9: `. . . . . . . .

No.\nIs it a wall? No.\nIs it backwards? No (I'm facing Right, came from Left).\nIs it my body? No.\nIs it enemy body? No.\n\nOkay.\n\nLet's write the plan.\nPlan: Secure the apple at (8, 9) by moving towards the top wall. Avoid the contested central and bottom clusters where Snake #1 is located.\n\nMove: RIGHT.\n\nWait, I should check if moving DOWN puts me in a position to trap the enemy.\nNo, the enemy has plenty of space.\nMoving RIGHT is the best \"safe\" scoring move.\n\nOne detail: The user prompt says \"If I go DOWN...\".\nLet's re-read the prompt carefully to ensure I didn't miss anything.\n\"Snake #1 - Head: (4, 2)\"\n\"Apples at: (4, 0), (5, 0), (3, 2), (8, 9), (7, 3)\"\nWait, `(7, 3)` is also an apple.\n`(7, 3)` is closer to the enemy (distance 3) than to me (distance 7).\nSo that's contested.\n\nOkay, confirmed. (8, 9) is the only safe-ish apple.\n\nOne more check: Is (3, 8) blocked?\nMap: Row 8 `. . T . . . . . . .`\n(0,8) empty? No, 0 is wall (coords 0-9).\nRow 8: `.` (0,8) is actually `.` because the map starts at 0.\nWait, the map is printed with columns 0-9 at the bottom.\n` 9 . . . . . . . . A .`\n` 8 . .

Safe.\nIf Enemy goes to (3, 2): Body includes (4, 2). Safe.\nIf Enemy goes to (5, 2): Body includes (4, 2). Safe.\nIf Enemy goes UP (4, 3): Body. Death. (This frees up space for me, but I shouldn't assume they die).\n\nSo RIGHT is safe.\n\nWhat about DOWN?\n(2, 6). Body [(2, 7)].\nEnemy moves to (4, 1). Safe.\nEnemy moves to (3, 2). Safe.\nEnemy moves to (5, 2). Safe.\n\nBoth are safe.\nWhy is RIGHT better?\nBecause it leads to the apple (8, 9) which is uncontested.\nDOWN leads to apples (4, 0), (5, 0) which are contested.\nTherefore, RIGHT is the strategic move.\n\nWait, if I go DOWN, am I closer to ANY uncontested apple?\n(7, 3) is closer to the enemy.\n(8, 9) is far.\n(3, 2), (4, 2) are contested.\n(4, 0), (5, 0) are contested.\n\nSo no matter where I go, I have to travel for an apple.\nThe shortest travel to a *reachable* apple is to (8, 9) if I go RIGHT.\nIf I go DOWN, I am far from (8, 9).\nIf I go DOWN, I am close to (4, 0) but the enemy is closer.\n\nTherefore, RIGHT is correct.\n\nOne edge case: What if the enemy moves RIGHT?\nThen they are at (5, 2).\nThey are further from the bottom apples.\nThey are still far from (8, 9).\nThis doesn't change my decision.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves LEFT?\nThey are at (3, 2).\nThey are closer to the bottom apples (via diagonal blocked).\nThey are still far from (8, 9).\nThis doesn't change my decision.\n\nSo, RIGHT is the most consistent move to accumulate score safely.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to position myself for the apple at (8, 9). I will stay on the top side of the board to avoid the conflict zone near the enemy's current position.\n\nMove: RIGHT.\n\nWait, I need to make sure I don't move into my own body.\nMy body is at (2, 8).\nI am at (2, 7).\nI move to (3, 7).\n(3, 7) is empty.\nMy tail will move to (2, 7).\nSo my body next turn will be at [(2, 7)].\nI am safe.\n\nOkay.\n\nDouble check the \"backwards\" rule.\nI am at (2, 7).\nMy body is at (2, 8) (Up).\nI move to (3, 7) (Right).\nRight is not backwards (which would be Up).\nSo I am safe.\n\nFinal check on coordinate ranges.\nX: 0 to 9. Y: 0 to 9.\n(3, 7) is within range.\n\nMove: RIGHT.\n\nPlan: Head towards the top right apple (8, 9) to avoid the enemy in the center. The enemy is competing for the apples at (3,2), (4,2), (4,0), (5,0). I will take the isolated apple at (8,9).\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT.\n\nWait, I should consider if I can eat an apple in one move.\nNo apples at (3, 7).\nSo I just move.\n\nOkay.\n\nOne last check. The enemy is at (4, 2).\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 7).\nEnemy moves LEFT to (3, 2).\nNo collision.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 7).\nEnemy moves DOWN to (4, 1).\nNo collision.\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (3, 7).\nEnemy moves RIGHT to (5, 2).\nNo collision.\n\nAll good.\n\nThe only other consideration is if the enemy goes for the apple at (7, 3).\nDistance: |4-7| + |2-3| = 3 + 1 = 4.\nIf they go there, they are even further from me.\nThis confirms that the top path is safe.\n\nDecision: RIGHT.\n\nPlan: Secure the apple at (8, 9) by moving towards the top wall. Avoid the contested central and bottom clusters where Snake #1 is located.\n\nMove: RIGHT.\n\nWait, I should not write the move in the plan. The plan is just for reasoning.\nThe final output must be just the word.\n\nOkay.\n\nOne tiny detail: The board map shows `(2, 8)` as `T`. This confirms my body is there.\nThe board map shows `(2, 7)` as `0`. This confirms my head is there.\nThe board map shows `(2, 6)` as `.`.\nThe board map shows `(3, 7)` as `.`.\nThe board map shows `(1, 7)` as `.`.\nAll moves are valid.\n\nI will stick with RIGHT.\n\nOne thought: Is it possible to trap the enemy?\nNo, I am too small (length 1) and far away.\n\nIs it possible to get trapped?\nIf I go RIGHT, I can move along the wall.\nIf I go LEFT, I might hit the wall at (0, 7) and get stuck.\nSo RIGHT is safer than LEFT.\n\nIf I go DOWN, I might get stuck at the bottom wall (y=0).\nSo RIGHT is safer than DOWN.\n\nOkay.\n\nMove: RIGHT.\n\nWait, I just noticed the prompt says \"My body: [(2, 8)]\". (Head at 2,7).\nIf I go DOWN to (2, 6).\n(2, 6) is empty.\nMy body becomes [(2, 7)].\nNext turn, I am at (2, 6).\nMy body is at (2, 7).\nI can go DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. UP is blocked by body.\nFrom (2, 6), if I go DOWN again to (2, 5), I am safe.\nFrom (2, 5), if I go DOWN to (2, 4), I am safe.\nI can keep going down.\nI am never trapped.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (3, 7).\nMy body becomes [(2, 7)].\nNext turn, I am at (3, 7).\nMy body is at (2, 7).\nI can go UP (3, 8), DOWN (3, 6), RIGHT (4, 7), LEFT (2, 7) (body).\nI am not trapped.\n\nBoth are safe.\nWhy is RIGHT better?\nBecause it leads to the apple (8, 9) which the enemy is NOT contesting.\nThe enemy is contesting the other apples.\nTherefore, RIGHT is the winning move.\n\nMove: RIGHT.\n\nThe prompt asks for a \"short long-term plan\".\n\"Plan: Secure the apple at (8, 9) by moving towards the top wall. Avoid the contested central and bottom clusters where Snake #1 is located.\"\n\nThis is good.\n\nFinal output format:\n[Plan]\nMove\n\nExample:\n**START LONG-TERM PLAN**\nMy plan...\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\nMOVE\n\nWait, the prompt says: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn. Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\nSo I just write the text.\n\nThe final line must be exactly one word.\n\nOkay.\n\nOne last check on the \"backwards\" rule.\n\"If you move backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\nI am at (2, 7).\nBody is at (2, 8).\nGoing UP would be (2, 8) -> backwards -> death.\nGoing DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT are fine.\n\nSo my safe moves are: DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nAmong these, RIGHT is best.\n\nOkay.\n\nWait, I should confirm the coordinates one last time.\nBottom left is (0, 0).\nTop right is (9, 9).\nY increases UP.\nX increases RIGHT.\n\nMy head (2, 7).\nRight is (3, 7).

Moving towards the central apple at (6,6) is safer and more strategic. From (6,6), I will have a path to the apples in the top-right corner ((7,3) and (8,9)) while keeping distance from the enemy.\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nTo decide my next move:\n1.  **Current Position:** Head at (4, 7), Body at (3, 7).\n2.  **Immediate Safety Check:**\n    *   **UP:** (4, 8) is empty. Safe.\n    *   **DOWN:** (4, 6) is empty. Safe.\n    *   **LEFT:** (3, 7) is my current body (tail). Since I am moving at the same time as the tail moves forward, I check if this is the *only* cell occupied by my body. I have a body segment at (3, 7). If I move LEFT to (3, 7), I am moving into the cell currently occupied by my tail. However, the rules state \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself\". The cell directly behind my head is (3, 7). This is effectively moving backward. While the tail *might* move, occupying the square directly behind the head is typically prohibited or risky. To be absolutely safe, I will eliminate this.\n    *   **RIGHT:** (5, 7) is empty. Safe.\n3.  **Strategic Evaluation of Safe Moves:**\n    *   **UP (to 4, 8):** Moves me towards the top wall and the apple at (8, 9).\n    *   **DOWN (to 4, 6):** Moves me towards the apple at (6, 6) and the center. Looking at the board, the area below (4, 6) is (4, 5) [Empty], (4, 4) [Snake #1 Body], (4, 3) [Snake #1 Body], (4, 2) [Snake #1 Body], (4, 1) [Empty], (4, 0) [Apple]. Moving DOWN gets me closer to the central cluster, which is currently occupied by Snake #1. This could lead to conflict.\n    *   **RIGHT (to 5, 7):** Moves me East. (6, 7) is empty, (7, 7) is empty. This path leads towards (7, 3) and (8, 9). It also moves me slightly closer to the central apple at (6, 6) but keeps me in the clear top area.\n\n    Comparing **UP** and **RIGHT**:\n    *   **RIGHT** leads towards the central area but stays in the open vertical corridor (x=5,6,7). It offers flexibility.\n    *   **UP** takes me to the top edge (y=8). From there I can go Right or Left. However, going to y=8 means I might get pinned against the wall eventually.\n\n    Let's re-evaluate **DOWN (4, 6)**.\n    Target: (6, 6).\n    Current Head: (4, 7).\n    Distance: Manhattan distance 3.\n    Enemy Status: Snake #1 is at (3, 1) with a long body reaching (7, 5). They are \"below\" me.\n    If I go DOWN to (4, 6):\n    Next turn, I could go RIGHT to (5, 6), then RIGHT to (6, 6).\n    If I go RIGHT to (5, 7):\n    Next turn, I could go DOWN to (5, 6), then LEFT to (6, 6)? No, (6, 6) is to the right.\n    Actually, if I go RIGHT to (5, 7), I can go DOWN to (5, 6), then RIGHT to (6, 6).\n    Both paths seem open.\n\n    Let's look at the board again.\n    The \"Long-Term Plan\" suggests moving towards the central apple (6,6) to avoid the immediate conflict at the bottom apples.\n    Currently at (4, 7).\n    Path to (6, 6):\n    Option A: DOWN -> (4, 6), then RIGHT -> (5, 6), then RIGHT -> (6, 6).\n    Option B: RIGHT -> (5, 7), then DOWN -> (5, 6), then LEFT -> (4, 6)? No, (4, 6) is to the left. To get to (6, 6) from (5, 7), I need to go DOWN, DOWN? (5, 5).\n    Let's calculate coordinates:\n    (4, 7) -> (4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (6, 6). (Manhattan distance 3)\n    (4, 7) -> (5, 7) -> (5, 6) -> (6, 6). (Manhattan distance 3)\n\n    Which is safer?\n    If I go DOWN to (4, 6):\n    I am now at y=6. The enemy is at y=5 and lower. (4, 5) is empty. (4, 4) is enemy body.\n    If I go RIGHT to (5, 7):\n    I am still at y=7. I am further from the enemy.\n\n    Let's reconsider the UP move towards (8,9).\n    (4, 7) -> (4, 8) -> (5, 8) -> (6, 8) -> (7, 8) -> (8, 8) -> (8, 9).\n    This is a long path. It's safe, but Snake #1 has 8 apples. I only have 1. I need points. (6, 6) is closer.\n\n    Let's reconsider the DOWN move.\n    (4, 7) -> (4, 6).\n    Is (4, 6) safe from the enemy *next* turn?\n    Enemy is at (3, 1). Their possible moves are likely to chase the apples at the bottom or left.\n    The apples are at (4,0), (5,0), (3,0), (2,0).\n    The enemy is at (3,1). They are in a bottleneck on the left?\n    Let's check the board.\n    `9 . . . . . . . . A .`\n    `8 . . . . . . . . . .`\n    `7 . . . T 0 . . . . .`  <-- Me at (4,7)\n    `6 . . . . . . A . . .`  <-- (4,6) is here. (6,6) is apple.\n    `5 . . . . . . . T . .`  <-- (4,5) is empty.\n    `4 . . . . T T T T . .`  <-- (4,4) is Enemy Body.\n    `3 . . . . T . . A . .`  <-- (4,3) is Enemy Body.\n    `2 . . . T T . . . . .`  <-- (4,2) is Enemy Body.\n    `1 . . . 1 . . . . . .`  <-- Enemy Head at (3,1).\n    `0 . . . . A A . . . .`\n\n    My best move seems to be **DOWN** or **RIGHT**.\n    If I go **DOWN** to (4, 6):\n    I am moving towards the apple at (6, 6).\n    If I go **RIGHT** to (5, 7):\n    I am moving towards the right side.\n\n    Let's look at the board state again.\n    Snake #1 is long. They are likely to survive for a while. I need to eat.\n    The central apple (6, 6) is accessible.\n    The top-right apples are also accessible.\n    The bottom apples are currently blocked by Snake #1.\n\n    Let's check for collisions with Snake #1.\n    Head (4, 7).\n    If I move DOWN to (4, 6):\n    Snake #1 Head is at (3, 1). It is very far. Snake #1 Body occupies x=3,4,5,6,7 at y=2,3,4,5.\n    At y=6, the board is empty.\n    So (4, 6) is safe.\n\n    Is there a risk of Snake #1 moving to (4, 6)? No, they are at (3, 1). They can't reach (4, 6) in one turn.\n\n    Let's check \"Safe Follow-up Moves\".\n    From (4, 6):\n    - UP: (4, 7) (Old head, empty now? No, the tail moves. My body is (3, 7). So (4, 7) is empty). Safe.\n    - DOWN: (4, 5) (Empty). Safe.\n    - LEFT: (3, 6) (Empty). Safe.\n    - RIGHT: (5, 6) (Empty). Safe.\n    From (5, 7):\n    - UP: (5, 8) (Empty). Safe.\n    - DOWN: (5, 6) (Empty). Safe.\n    - LEFT: (4, 7) (Old head, empty). Safe.\n    - RIGHT: (6, 7) (Empty). Safe.\n\n    Both (4, 6) and (5, 7) offer excellent mobility.\n    (4, 6) is closer to the central apple (6, 6).\n    (5, 7) is slightly closer to the top-right apples but further from the center.\n\n    The goal is to eat apples. Snake #1 has 8. I have 1.\n    I should prioritize the closest apple that isn't contested.\n    The apples at (4, 0) and (5, 0) are contested by Snake #1.\n    The apple at (6, 6) is unguarded.\n    The apple at (7, 3) is unguarded.\n    The apple at (8, 9) is unguarded.\n\n    Moving DOWN towards (6, 6) seems the most efficient immediate path to a point.\n\n    Wait, let me check the \"Last Move Rationale\".\n    \"Move towards the apple at (8, 9) to avoid the immediate conflict... My next move will likely be UP to (3, 8)...\"\n    Note: My current head is (4, 7). (3, 8) is Up-Left? No, that's not a valid single move. \"UP to (3, 8)\" implies from (3, 7)? My head is (4, 7). The text \"UP to (3, 8)\" must be a typo or referring to a state where I was at (3, 7)? No, \"Head: (4, 7)\". If I am at (4, 7), moving UP takes me to (4, 8). Moving LEFT takes me to (3, 7).\n    The previous plan suggested going to (8, 9). That is a long path.\n    Let's stick to the \"Process\" which says \"Among the moves that keep you alive, prefer moves that... increase your chance of safely eating apples\".\n    The closest safe apple is (6, 6).\n    Moving DOWN to (4, 6) gets me closer to (6, 6) by 1 step in Y.\n    Moving RIGHT to (5, 7) gets me closer to (6, 6) by 1 step in X.\n\n    However, (4, 6) puts me at the same Y-level as the enemy body parts at y=5 (which are occupied by body). This might be safer as I am \"above\" the enemy cluster.\n    Let's check the \"crowded center\".\n    The enemy body fills x=3,4,5,6,7 at y=2,3,4,5.\n    If I go DOWN to (4, 6), I am at y=6. The enemy is at y=5.\n    If I go DOWN to (4, 6), the space below me (y=5) is mostly occupied by the enemy.\n    But if I stay at y=7 or go to y=8, I am in the clear.\n\n    Is there an apple at (6, 6)? Yes.\n    Is (6, 6) reachable?\n    From (4, 7):\n    Option 1: DOWN (4, 6). Then RIGHT (5, 6). Then RIGHT (6, 6).\n    Option 2: RIGHT (5, 7). Then DOWN (5, 6). Then RIGHT (6, 6).\n\n    If I go DOWN now, I am at (4, 6). The path (5, 6) -> (6, 6) is currently empty.\n    If I go RIGHT now, I am at (5, 7). The path (5, 6) -> (6, 6) is currently empty.\n\n    The board shows apples at (7, 3). This is also interesting.\n    (7, 3) is currently empty. Snake #1 body is at (7, 4) and (7, 5).\n    So (7, 3) is right below the enemy body.\n    This makes (7, 3) risky. If Snake #1 is long, its tail might move, but the head is at (3, 1). It can't reach (7, 3) quickly.\n\n    Let's go back to the \"Avoid Conflict\" logic.\n    Snake #1 is at the bottom left. I am at the top center.\n    Moving DOWN brings me closer to them.\n    Moving RIGHT or UP moves me away.\n\n    However, I need points.\n    If I move UP (to 4, 8):\n    I am at y=8.\n    Next turn, I can go RIGHT to (5, 8).\n    Then RIGHT to (6, 8).\n    Then DOWN to (6, 7).\n    Then DOWN to (6, 6).\n    This path is safe but takes many turns.\n\n    If I move DOWN (to 4, 6):\n    I am at y= 6.\n    Next turn, I can go RIGHT to (5, 6).\n    Then RIGHT to (6, 6).\n    This is much faster.\n\n    Is (4, 6) dangerous?\n    The only snake body at y=6 is... none. Snake #1 is at y=5 max (wait, (7, 5) is body). The body is at y=5 at x=7.\n    The head is at (3, 1).\n    So (4, 6) is definitely empty of the enemy.\n    Is it dangerous from \"Head-on collision\"?\n    Enemy head is (3, 1). It can't reach (4, 6).\n\n    So, DOWN is safe and efficient.\n    RIGHT is safe and efficient.\n    UP is safe but inefficient.\n\n    Let's consider the \"Safe follow-up moves\" from (4, 6) vs (5, 7).\n    (4, 6): Neighbors (4, 7), (4, 5), (3, 6), (5, 6).\n    (4, 7) was my previous head. It will be empty.\n    (4, 5) is empty (board).\n    (3, 6) is empty.\n    (5, 6) is empty.\n    All 4 directions are safe from walls and immediate body collision.\n    (4, 5) is \"above\" the enemy cluster. If the enemy moves, they might move into (3, 4) or (3, 5) etc.\n    (4, 5) is very close to the enemy body at (4, 4).\n\n    Let's reconsider the \"Long-Term Plan\" in the prompt:\n    \"Move towards the apple at (8, 9) to avoid the immediate conflict over the central and bottom apples with Snake #1.\"\n    \"The enemy is much closer to the apples at (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 0), and (5, 0).\"\n    \"By heading to the top-right corner, I can secure a point safely while the enemy contends with the crowded center.\"\n\n    This logic is sound regarding safety. However, it is extremely conservative. It assumes I cannot compete for (6, 6) or (7, 3).\n    But looking at (6, 6):\n    I am at (4, 7). Distance 3.\n    Enemy is at (3, 1). Distance 9 (Manhattan) or more.\n    The enemy is far away from (6, 6).\n    The \"crowded center\" mentioned is the bottom-left.\n    (6, 6) is \"center-right\".\n\n    So, is (6, 6) safe?\n    Yes, relative to Snake #1.\n    Is there any other danger?\n    Just Snake #1.\n\n    Let's evaluate the \"Right\" move again.\n    (4, 7) -> (5, 7).\n    From there, (6, 7), (7, 7) are empty.\n    (6, 6) is apple.\n    (7, 3) is apple.\n    (8, 9) is apple.\n\n    Let's evaluate \"Down\".\n    (4, 7) -> (4, 6).\n    From there, (5, 6) -> (6, 6).\n    This is the shortest path to an apple.\n\n    Is there any reason *not* to go DOWN?\n    If I go DOWN, I am at y=6.\n    If the enemy somehow gets to y=6 (unlikely), I could be in trouble.\n    But the enemy is at y=1 and spreading downwards (increasing y).\n    If they keep going down, they hit the wall at y=0.\n    They are already at y=1.\n    They will likely turn around or go to (4,0) or (5,0).\n    They are not a threat to me at y=6.\n\n    What about my own tail?\n    I am at (4, 7), body (3, 7).\n    If I move DOWN to (4, 6), my body moves from (3, 7) to (4, 7).\n    Next turn, if I am at (4, 6), my body is (4, 7).\n    If I try to go UP, I would go to (4, 7) which is my body. That's a trap!\n    So, if I go DOWN now, I cannot go UP next turn.\n    This reduces my options, but it's not a trap if I have other options.\n    From (4, 6), I can go LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n    LEFT: (3, 6). Empty.\n    DOWN: (4, 5). Empty.\n    RIGHT: (5, 6). Empty.\n    So I have 3 options next turn. Not trapped.\n\n    What if I go RIGHT to (5, 7)?\n    My body moves to (4, 7).\n    From (5, 7), I can go UP (5, 8), DOWN (5, 6), LEFT (4, 7 - body!), RIGHT (6, 7).\n    Moving LEFT would be backwards into my body.\n    So from (5, 7), I lose the LEFT option.\n    I would have 3 options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n    Both moves give me 3 future options.\n    (4, 6) offers movement towards the wall (DOWN) and side (LEFT/RIGHT).\n    (5, 7) offers movement towards the wall (UP) and side (RIGHT).\n\n    Let's look at the apples again.\n    Apple at (6, 6).\n    If I go DOWN to (4, 6), I am getting closer to (6, 6).\n    If I go RIGHT to (5, 7), I am getting closer to (6, 6).\n\n    Let's look at the board again.\n    `7 . . . T 0 . . . . .` (0 is me, T is tail)\n    `6 . . . . . . A . . .`\n    `5 . . . . . . . T . .`\n\n    If I go DOWN to (4, 6):\n    Next turn I am at (4, 6).\n    The board is clear around me.\n    I can go RIGHT to (5, 6).\n    Then I am at (5, 6). (6, 6) is right next to me.\n\n    If I go RIGHT to (5, 7):\n    Next turn I am at (5, 7).\n    I can go DOWN to (5, 6).\n    Then I am at (5, 6).\n\n    Both paths converge on (5, 6).\n    But which starting move puts me in a better position *this* turn?\n    Currently, the board is clear at y=7 and y=6.\n    (4, 7) -> (4, 6) is a straight line.\n    (4, 7) -> (5, 7) is a shift right.\n\n    Let's consider the enemy.\n    Snake #1 head (3, 1).\n    They are on the left side.\n    Moving RIGHT moves me away from them.\n    Moving DOWN moves me towards them (in terms of Y, but they are far away in X).\n\n    Actually, let's check the \"crowded center\" logic.\n    \"By heading to the top-right corner, I can secure a point safely while the enemy contends with the crowded center.\"\n    This implies avoiding (6, 6) and (7, 3) entirely?\n    No, just the \"bottom apples\".\n    (6, 6) is not a \"bottom apple\".\n    (7, 3) is somewhat low.\n    (8, 9) is top-right.\n\n    If I strictly follow the \"Top-Right\" plan:\n    Move UP to (4, 8).\n    This is safe.\n    But it's slow.\n    I am currently losing 1-8. I need points.\n    I should be aggressive if safe.\n    Is (6, 6) safe? Yes.\n    Is the path to (6, 6) safe?\n    (4, 7) -> (4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (6, 6).\n    Cells: (4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 6).\n    Are any of these occupied?\n    (4, 6): Empty.\n    (5, 6): Empty.\n    (6, 6): Apple.\n    Is there any threat?\n    Snake #1 head is at (3, 1).\n    In 3 turns, can Snake #1 reach (6, 6)?\n    Distance: |3-6| + |1-6| = 3 + 5 = 8.\n    No.\n\n    So, going for (6, 6) seems perfectly viable and much faster than (8, 9).\n    The distance to (8, 9) is |4-8| + |7-9| = 4 + 2 = 6.\n    To get to (8, 9), I need 6 moves.\n    To get to (6, 6), I need 3 moves.\n    (6, 6) is closer.\n\n    Let's reconsider the \"Long-Term Plan\" provided in the prompt.\n    It might be a \"previous\" plan that I should reconsider or follow?\n    \"You may also write a short long-term plan... This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\n    \"START LONG-TERM PLAN... END LONG-TERM PLAN\"\n    The prompt shows me *my* last rationale.\n    \"Move towards the apple at (8, 9) to avoid the immediate conflict...\"\n    \"My next move will likely be UP to (3, 8)\"\n    Wait, \"UP to (3, 8)\" is a typo in the prompt? From (4, 7), UP is (4, 8).\n    Maybe I was at (3, 7) before? No, \"Head: (4, 7)\".\n    Anyway, I should make my own decision based on the current board.\n\n    Current Board:\n    Empty space around (4, 7).\n    Apple at (6, 6) is reachable and safe.\n    Enemy is far away.\n\n    Let's check if moving DOWN puts me close to the enemy's *future* path?\n    Enemy is at (3, 1). They are likely to move towards (4, 0), (5, 0) or the left edge.\n    They are moving South (increasing Y).\n    I am at (4, 7).\n    If I go DOWN to (4, 6), I am at the same X as their current column (3,4) but higher Y.\n    If they go UP (decreasing Y), they might meet me?\n    But they are at the bottom. They have apples there. They will probably eat the bottom apples.\n    If they eat the bottom apples, they might grow and eventually turn up.\n    But that takes time.\n\n    Let's consider the \"Standard Snake Strategy\":\n    1. Don't die.\n    2. Eat food.\n    3. Don't trap yourself.\n\n    Move: DOWN to (4, 6).\n    Why?\n    - It's safe (empty).\n    - It's closer to (6, 6) (Manhattan distance reduced from 3 to 2).\n    - It avoids the wall (I'm at y=6, wall is at y=0 and y=9).\n    - It keeps options open (Left, Down, Right).\n\n    Move: RIGHT to (5, 7).\n    - Safe.\n    - Closer to (6, 6) (Distance reduced from 3 to 2).\n    - Moves away from the left side (where enemy is).\n\n    Move: UP to (4, 8).\n    - Safe.\n    - Further from (6, 6) (Distance becomes 5).\n    - Moves towards the top wall.\n\n    Comparing DOWN and RIGHT:\n    DOWN gets me closer to the center (y=5, y=4...).\n    RIGHT keeps me higher.\n    The \"Top-Right\" plan suggests staying high/right.\n    But (6, 6) is available.\n    If I go RIGHT, I am at (5, 7).\n    From there, I can go DOWN to (5, 6) or UP to (5, 8).\n    If I go DOWN to (4, 6), I can go DOWN to (4, 5) or RIGHT to (5, 6).\n\n    Let's look at the \"crowded center\" again.\n    The enemy body occupies y=2, 3, 4, 5.\n    If I go DOWN to (4, 6), I am immediately above the occupied zone (y=5).\n    If I go DOWN to (4, 5), I am at y=5. The enemy is at y=5 (7, 5).\n    Is (4, 5) safe?\n    Board `5 . . . . . . . T . .`. (4, 5) is empty.\n    But I am moving into the \"danger zone\" (y=5).\n    If I stay at y=7 or y=8, I am safer.\n\n    However, to get to (6, 6), I *have* to go to y=6.\n    (6, 6) is at y=6.\n    So I will pass through y=6.\n    Is y=6 safe?\n    Board `6 . . . . . . A . . .`.\n    Yes, y=6 is completely empty of snakes.\n\n    So, moving to (4, 6) is safe.\n    Moving to (5, 7) is safe.\n\n    Which one is better for *future* options?\n    At (4, 6):\n    I can go DOWN to (4, 5). (4, 5) is empty.\n    From (4, 5), I can go DOWN to (4, 4). (4, 4) is Enemy Body. I DIE.\n    So if I go DOWN to (4, 6), I lose the ability to go DOWN safely in the future unless I move LEFT or RIGHT first.\n    Wait, \"future options\" means the set of moves available *next* turn.\n    At (4, 6), I have LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT. (UP is blocked by my body moving to (4, 7)).\n    At (5, 7), I have UP, DOWN, RIGHT. (LEFT is blocked).\n\n    At (4, 6), the \"DOWN\" option (to 4, 5) is safe *next* turn. But it leads to a place where further DOWN is blocked by the enemy.\n    At (5, 7), the \"DOWN\" option (to 5, 6) is safe *next* turn. From (5, 6), further DOWN (to 5, 5) is safe (board shows empty at 5, 5).\n    Actually, looking at the board:\n    `5 . . . . . . . T . .`\n    `4 . . . . T T T T . .`\n    `3 . . . . T . . A . .`\n    `2 . . . T T . . . . .`\n    `1 . . . 1 . . . . . .`\n    `0 . . . . A A . . . .`\n\n    Let's trace paths.\n    Target: (6, 6).\n    Path 1 (Start DOWN): (4,7) -> (4,6) -> (5,6) -> (6,6).\n    Path 2 (Start RIGHT): (4,7) -> (5,7) -> (5,6) -> (6,6).\n\n    In both cases, (5, 6) is the cell before the apple.\n    Which start puts me in a better position at (5, 6)?\n    If I start DOWN:\n    Turn 1: Head (4, 6), Tail (3, 7).\n    Turn 2: Head (5, 6), Tail (4, 6).\n    If I start RIGHT:\n    Turn 1: Head (5, 7), Tail (4, 7).\n    Turn 2: Head (5, 6), Tail (5, 7).\n\n    At (5, 6) in both scenarios:\n    My body follows.\n    In Scenario 1 (Down start), my body is (4, 6).\n    In Scenario 2 (Right start), my body is (5, 7).\n\n    At (5, 6):\n    I need to move to (6, 6) to eat.\n    Is (6, 6) safe?\n    Yes.\n    Is the path open?\n    Yes.\n\n    Is there any difference?\n    Scenario 1: At (5, 6), body at (4, 6). I can go RIGHT (6, 6), DOWN (5, 5), UP (5, 7 - empty). I cannot go LEFT (4, 6) (body).\n    Scenario 2: At (5, 6), body at (5, 7). I can go RIGHT (6, 6), DOWN (5, 5), LEFT (4, 6 - empty). I cannot go UP (5, 7) (body).\n\n    Both give me 3 options.\n    Scenario 1 (Down start) gives me UP option (5, 7). (5, 7) is currently empty. (5, 8) is empty.\n    Scenario 2 (Right start) gives me LEFT option (4, 6). (4, 6) is currently empty. (3, 6) is empty.\n\n    It's symmetric.\n\n    Let's go back to the \"Long-Term Plan\" provided.\n    \"Move towards the apple at (8, 9) to avoid the immediate conflict over the central and bottom apples with Snake #1.\"\n    \"The enemy is much closer to the apples at (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 0), and (5, 0).\"\n\n    This suggests avoiding (4, 0) and (5, 0).\n    It also mentions (3, 2) and (4, 2). These are deep in enemy territory.\n    What about (6, 6)? The prompt doesn't explicitly mention it as \"crowded\".\n    It's \"central\", but the enemy is \"bottom-left\".\n    (6, 6) is \"center-right\".\n    I think (6, 6) is a safe target.\n\n    Let's double check the \"Rules\":\n    \"Among the moves that keep you alive, prefer moves that both: increase your chance of safely eating apples, and keep future options open\"\n\n    **UP (4, 8):**\n    - Safe? Yes.\n    - Eat apples? (8, 9) is far. (6, 6) is far.\n    - Future options? 3 options (Left, Right, Down).\n    - Distance to (6, 6) = 6.\n\n    **DOWN (4, 6):**\n    - Safe? Yes.\n    - Eat apples? (6, 6) is close. (7, 3) is close.\n    - Future options? 3 options (Left, Down, Right).\n    - Distance to (6, 6) = 2.\n\n    **RIGHT (5, 7):**\n    - Safe? Yes.\n    - Eat apples? (6, 6) is close. (7, 3) is close.\n    - Future options? 3 options (Up, Down, Right).\n    - Distance to (6, 6) = 2.\n\n    **LEFT (3, 7):**\n    - Safe? (3, 7) is currently empty (my body is at (3, 7)? No, my body is at (3, 7). \"Body: [(3, 7)]\".\n    - Wait. My head is (4, 7). My body is [(3, 7)].\n    - If I move LEFT to (3, 7), I move into my body segment.\n    - Is it the tail? Yes, the tail is (3, 7).\n    - Does the tail move? Yes.\n    - \"If you move onto any snake's body (including your own), you die.\"\n    - \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n    - So LEFT is likely death.\n    - Eliminate LEFT.\n\n    So, UP, DOWN, RIGHT are candidates.\n\n    The prompt says: \"My next move will likely be UP to (3, 8)\".\n    This was my previous plan.\n    Why did I plan that?\n    \"Move towards the apple at (8, 9)\".\n    \"Avoid the immediate conflict\".\n    \n    Is there a conflict at (6, 6)?\n    Distance from Enemy Head (3, 1) to (6, 6) is 8 turns.\n    Distance from Me (4, 7) to (6, 6) is 3 turns.\n    I can get there first. It's not a conflict, it's a scoop.\n\n    Is there a conflict at (5, 0) or (4, 0)?\n    Yes, enemy is there.\n    Is there a conflict at (3, 2) or (4, 2)?\n    Yes, enemy body is there.\n\n    So, the \"conflict\" is at the bottom left.\n    The \"center\" (6, 6) and \"top-right\" (8, 9) are free.\n\n    Why stick to the previous plan (Go Top-Right)?\n    If I stick to the plan, I go UP.\n    If I deviate (Down or Right), I am getting closer to the enemy (Manhattan distance to enemy head).\n    Current distance: |4-3| + |7-1| = 1 + 6 = 7.\n    If I go DOWN (4, 6): |4-3| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6. (Closer)\n    If I go RIGHT (5, 7): |5-3| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8. (Further)\n    If I go UP (4, 8): |4-3| + |8-1| = 1 + 7 = 8. (Further)\n\n    The prompt explicitly advises: \"Move towards the apple at (8, 9) to avoid the immediate conflict... By heading to the top-right corner, I can secure a point safely while the enemy contends with the crowded center.\"\n    \n    This is a very strong hint from the \"Long-Term Plan\" I wrote last turn.\n    It suggests avoiding the center entirely until the enemy is distracted or dead.\n    It suggests securing the top-right apple (8, 9).\n    \n    If I follow that plan, I should move UP.\n    \n    Let's verify if UP is safe.\n    (4, 8). Empty. On the board row 8 is `8 . . . . . . . . . .`.\n    Yes.\n\n    Is there any apple closer than (8, 9) that is safe?\n    (7, 3) is closer. But it's \"lower\".\n    (6, 6) is closer. It's \"center\".\n    The plan argues these are \"crowded\".\n    Is (6, 6) crowded? No.\n    Is the *path* to (6, 6) crowded? No.\n    \n    However, the prompt asks me to follow the \"Long-Term Plan\" logic or write a new one.\n    If I write a new one, I can justify a different move.\n    But the prompt shows me *my* last plan.\n    \"START LONG-TERM PLAN... END LONG-TERM PLAN\"\n    It says \"You may also write a short long-term plan... This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\n    \n    If I simply repeat the plan, I move UP.\n    If I change the plan, I move DOWN/RIGHT.\n    \n    Let's look at Snake #1 again.\n    Head (3, 1).\n    Body: (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4), (7, 4), (7, 5).\n    The tail is at (7, 5).\n    The board shows:\n    `5 . . . . . . . T . .` (Tail at (7, 5)).\n    `4 . . . . T T T T . .` (Body at (7,4)... (4,4)).\n    `3 . . . . T . . A . .` (Body at (4,3) and apple at (7,3)).\n    `2 . . . T T . . . . .` (Body at (4,2), (3,2)).\n    `1 . . . 1 . . . . . .` (Head at (3,1)).\n    \n    Snake #1 has a very long body. They are essentially \"filling\" the left-center.\n    If I go to (6, 6), I am \"East\" of their body.\n    If I go to (4, 6), I am \"North\" of their body.\n    \n    Let's consider the \"head-on collision\" risk.\n    If I move to (4, 6), and Snake #1 moves to (3, 2) ... no, they can't hit me.\n    If I move to (5, 7), and Snake #1 moves to (3, 2) ... no.\n    \n    The \"Crowded Center\" argument in the prompt is likely referring to the apples at (4, 0), (5, 0) and maybe (3, 2) and (4, 2).\n    The prompt specifically says: \"The enemy is much closer to the apples at (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 0), and (5, 0).\"\n    It does NOT mention (6, 6) or (7, 3) or (8, 9) as \"crowded\".\n    \n    So, I don't *have* to go all the way to (8, 9).\n    But moving UP (towards 8,9) is consistent with \"avoiding the crowded center\".\n    \n    Is (6, 6) part of the \"crowded center\"?\n    The center of the board is (4.5, 4.5).\n    (6, 6) is upper-right of center.\n    (4, 4) is center.\n    \n    If I go DOWN, I am moving towards the center.\n    If I go UP, I am moving away from the center.\n    \n    Let's check the \"Safe follow-up moves\" for UP.\n    (4, 7) -> (4, 8).\n    Next turn, from (4, 8):\n    UP: (4, 9) (Wall). Safe? Moving off board is death. So UP is INVALID.\n    DOWN: (4, 7) (Old head, empty). Safe.\n    LEFT: (3, 8) (Empty). Safe.\n    RIGHT: (5, 8) (Empty). Safe.\n    So from (4, 8), I have 3 options (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).\n    I am pinned against the wall (cannot go UP).\n    This is slightly restrictive.\n    \n    Compare to DOWN (4, 6):\n    Next turn, from (4, 6):\n    UP: (4, 7) (Old head). Safe.\n    DOWN: (4, 5) (Empty). Safe.\n    LEFT: (3, 6) (Empty). Safe.\n    RIGHT: (5, 6) (Empty). Safe.\n    I have 4 options. (Wait, can I go UP? My body moves to (4, 7). So yes, UP is valid and empty).\n    So (4, 6) offers 4 options. (4, 8) offers 3 options.\n    \n    However, (4, 8) is closer to the top-right apple (8, 9).\n    (4, 6) is closer to the central apple (6, 6).\n    \n    The prompt emphasizes \"Avoid the immediate conflict\".\n    Moving UP is the safest move in terms of distance from the enemy.\n    Moving DOWN puts me on the \"edge\" of the enemy's zone.\n    \n    Let's check the rules again: \"Prefer moves that... keep future options open\".\n    (4, 6) offers more options than (4, 8).\n    \n    Let's check \"increase your chance of safely eating apples\".\n    Target (6, 6) is safe. Path is 3 moves.\n    Target (8, 9) is safe. Path is 6 moves.\n    Eating (6, 6) gives me 2 apples. Enemy has 8. I need to catch up.\n    Getting to (6, 6) quickly is good.\n    \n    But the prompt is very specific about \"Conflict\".\n    Snake #1 is long. If I get close to them, I risk getting cut off.\n    If I go DOWN to (4, 6), I am above their body (which is at y=4,5).\n    If they continue to grow, they might fill the space below me.\n    \n    However, (6, 6) is to the right.\n    If I go DOWN, then RIGHT, I am moving away from the enemy (x increases).\n    \n    Let's look at the board visualization again.\n    The enemy body creates a \"wall\" at x=3,4,5,6,7 for y=2,3,4.\n    At y=5, they are at x=7.\n    At y=6, they are nowhere.\n    \n    It seems safe to go DOWN/RIGHT.\n    \n    BUT.\n    The prompt *gives* me a plan.\n    \"START LONG-TERM PLAN... Move towards the apple at (8, 9)...\"\n    \n    Usually, in these scenarios, the \"Long-Term Plan\" provided is the one I should follow *unless* I have a very compelling reason to change it.\n    The reasoning provided in the plan is \"avoid conflict\".\n    \n    Let's assume the prompt's plan is the \"safe, conservative\" play.\n    My analysis suggests an \"aggressive\" play (Go for 6, 6).\n    \n    Is there a risk I missed?\n    Snake #1 Head (3, 1).\n    Snake #1 Body (4, 2) ...\n    If Snake #1 moves UP (to 3, 0)? No, (3, 0) is empty.\n    If Snake #1 moves RIGHT (to 4, 1)? (4, 1) is empty.\n    \n    If I go DOWN to (4, 6):\n    I am at (4, 6).\n    Snake #1 is at (3, 1).\n    There is no collision.\n    \n    Let's consider the \"Turn: 27 / 150\".\n    There is plenty of time. I don't *have* to rush.\n    Snake #1 has 8 apples. I have 1.\n    I should not play too passively, or I will lose by points at turn 150.\n    \n    Okay, let's look at the \"Win Condition\".\n    \"If all snakes die... snake with more apples wins.\"\n    \"If multiple snakes are alive at final turn... most apples wins.\"\n    \n    I need to score.\n    (6, 6) is the quickest score.\n    (8, 9) is the safest score.\n    \n    Is there an Apple at (7, 3)? Yes.\n    Is (7, 3) contested?\n    Snake #1 body is at (7, 4) and (7, 5).\n    If Snake #1 moves UP, they might go to (7, 3) if they want to eat the apple there.\n    Distance from Head (3, 1) to (7, 3) is |3-7| + |1-3| = 4 + 2 = 6.\n    I am at (4, 7). Distance to (7, 3) is |4-7| + |7-3| = 3 + 4 = 7.\n    Snake #1 is closer to (7, 3) than I am.\n    So (7, 3) is contested.\n    \n    What about (6, 6)?\n    Distance for Snake #1: 8.\n    Distance for Me: 3.\n    (6, 6) is MY apple.\n    \n    What about (8, 9)?\n    Distance for Snake #1: |3-8| + |1-9| = 5 + 8 = 13.\n    Distance for Me: |4-8| + |7-9| = 4 + 2 = 6.\n    (8, 9) is MY apple.\n    \n    So I have two safe apples: (6, 6) and (8, 9).\n    (6, 6) is much closer.\n    \n    Why would the prompt suggest (8, 9)?\n    \"Avoid conflict\".\n    If I go for (6, 6), I am moving \"into the board\".\n    If I go for (8, 9), I am moving \"towards the corner\".\n    Corners are dangerous for getting trapped.\n    The center is dangerous for getting hit.\n    \n    With 143 turns left, getting trapped is a real risk. Snake #1 is long and could build a wall.\n    However, if I go to (8, 9), I might get trapped if the enemy gets long and blocks the top edge.\n    If I stay mobile in the center, I have more escape routes.\n    \n    Let's reconsider the \"Conflict\" term.\n    Maybe \"Conflict\" means \"Fight for resources\".\n    If I go for (6, 6), I am claiming the center.\n    If I go for (8, 9), I am claiming the corner.\n    If I claim the center, I cut the board in half?\n    Not really.\n    \n    Let's assume the prompt's logic is sound.\n    \"By heading to the top-right corner, I can secure a point safely while the enemy contends with the crowded center.\"\n    This implies I should leave the center to the enemy.\n    The enemy is currently \"contending\" with the bottom-left.\n    If I go to the top-right, I am safe.\n    If I go to the center, I might bump into the enemy *later*.\n    \n    Let's try to follow the prompt's plan.\n    \"Move towards the apple at (8, 9)\".\n    This requires UP or RIGHT.\n    \"My next move will likely be UP to (3, 8)\" (typo: 4, 8).\n    \n    If I move UP to (4, 8):\n    I am safe.\n    I am closer to (8, 9).\n    I am far from the enemy.\n    \n    If I move DOWN to (4, 6):\n    I am safe.\n    I am closer to (6, 6).\n    I am closer to the enemy (but still safe).\n    \n    Which move is \"Better\"?\n    The prompt asks me to \"Consider all four directions\".\n    \"Eliminate any move that would immediately kill you\".\n    \"Among remaining safe moves, prefer moves that both: increase your chance of safely eating apples, and keep future options open\".\n    \n    UP (4, 8):\n    - Safe: Yes.\n    - Eating apples: (8, 9) is 6 moves away.\n    - Future options: 3 (Left, Right, Down). (Wall block).\n    \n    DOWN (4, 6):\n    - Safe: Yes.\n    - Eating apples: (6, 6) is 3 moves away.\n    - Future options: 3 (Left, Down, Right). (Body block). Or 4 if we count the space where the tail moves.\n    \n    RIGHT (5, 7):\n    - Safe: Yes.\n    - Eating apples: (6, 6) is 3 moves away (Right -> Down -> Right).\n    - Future options: 3 (Up, Down, Right). (Body block).\n    \n    Comparing DOWN and RIGHT to UP:\n    DOWN/RIGHT offer a point in 3 turns. UP offers a point in 6 turns.\n    To catch up (1 vs 8), I need points.\n    I should prioritize the closer apple *if safe*.\n    \n    Is (6, 6) safe?\n    Yes.\n    \n    Is the \"Conflict\" argument valid?\n    The enemy is far from (6, 6).\n    The enemy is busy at the bottom.\n    By the time the enemy gets to the center, I will have eaten the apple and moved on.\n    \n    So, I disagree with the \"Long-Term Plan\" provided in the prompt. It is too passive.\n    I should move towards the center apple.\n    \n    Which direction?\n    DOWN to (4, 6) or RIGHT to (5, 7).\n    \n    If I go DOWN to (4, 6):\n    I can then go RIGHT to (5, 6).\n    If I go RIGHT to (5, 7):\n    I can then go DOWN to (5, 6).\n    Both lead to (5, 6).\n    \n    From (4, 6), I am closer to the \"center\" vertically.\n    From (5, 7), I am closer to the \"center\" horizontally.\n    \n    Let's check the board for the path.\n    (4, 7) -> (4, 6) -> (5, 6) -> (6, 6).\n    This path is clear.\n    \n    (4, 7) -> (5, 7) -> (5, 6) -> (6, 6).\n    This path is clear.\n    \n    Is there any reason to prefer one over the other?\n    \"Keep future options open\".\n    At (4, 6):\n    I can go DOWN to (4, 5). (4, 5) is empty.\n    I can go LEFT to (3, 6). (3, 6) is empty.\n    I can go RIGHT to (5, 6). (5, 6) is empty.\n    I cannot go UP (blocked by body).\n    From (4, 5), I can go DOWN to (4, 4). (4, 4) is Enemy Body. Blocked.\n    \n    At (5, 7):\n    I can go UP to (5, 8). (5, 8) is empty.\n    I can go DOWN to (5, 6). (5, 6) is empty.\n    I can go RIGHT to (6, 7). (6, 7) is empty.\n    I cannot go LEFT (blocked by body).\n    \n    At (5, 7), the \"DOWN\" option (to 5, 6) leads to a place where further DOWN (to 5, 5) is empty.\n    At (4, 6), the \"DOWN\" option (to 4, 5) leads to a place where further DOWN is blocked by enemy.\n    \n    So, moving RIGHT to (5, 7) gives me better \"future options\" downwards than moving DOWN to (4, 6).\n    \n    Also, moving RIGHT moves me away from the enemy's X coordinate (3).\n    Moving DOWN keeps me at X=4, same as the enemy's body column.\n    \n    So, if I want to go for the apple at (6, 6), **RIGHT** seems slightly better than DOWN.\n    \n    Let's check UP again.\n    If I go UP, I am safe. But I am slow.\n    I need to catch up.\n    I should take calculated risks.\n    The risk of moving RIGHT to (5, 7) is minimal. The enemy is at (3, 1).\n    \n    So, the candidates are:\n    1. RIGHT (5, 7) - Aggressive, good future options.\n    2. DOWN (4, 6) - Aggressive, slightly worse future options.\n    3. UP (4, 8) - Passive, safe, slow.\n    \n    I will choose **RIGHT**.\n    \n    Wait, let me check the \"My last move information\".\n    \"RIGHT\"\n    I moved RIGHT last turn.\n    Where was I before?\n    Head was (4, 7).\n    If I moved RIGHT last turn, I would be at (5, 7) currently.\n    But the prompt says \"Head: (4, 7)\".\n    So I did NOT move RIGHT last turn. I am still at (4, 7).\n    The prompt says \"Your last move information: ... RIGHT\".\n    It says \"Turn: 27\".\n    \"Head: (4, 7)\".\n    \"Body: [(3, 7)]\".\n    This implies I just moved RIGHT to get to (4, 7)? No.\n    If I moved RIGHT from (3, 7), I would be at (4, 7). Yes.\n    So my previous position was (3, 7).\n    And I moved RIGHT.\n    \n    So I am currently at (4, 7). I came from (3, 7).\n    My body is [(3, 7)].\n    \n    If I move RIGHT again, I go to (5, 7).\n    Is (5, 7) empty? Yes.\n    Is (5, 7) safe?\n    Yes.\n    Is this a \"move backwards\"? No.\n    \n    Is there any reason to *not* move RIGHT?\n    If I am at (4, 7) and came from (3, 7), moving RIGHT is fine.\n    \n    So, my move is **RIGHT**.\n    \n    Let's write the Long-Term Plan.\n    \"I will continue moving towards the central apple at (6, 6). It is the safest and quickest point available. I will avoid the bottom-left conflict.\"\n    \n    Final check.\n    Move: RIGHT.\n    New Head: (5, 7).\n    New Body: [(4, 7)].\n    Is (5, 7) occupied? No.\n    Is (5, 7) off board? No.\n    Is (5, 7) my body? No.\n    Is (5, 7) Enemy body? No.\n    \n    All checks pass.\n\n    One small check: \"If two snake heads move into the same cell... both die.\"\n    Enemy head is at (3, 1). It cannot reach (5, 7).\n\n    So, **RIGHT** is the move.\n    \n    Wait, I should check if I can go LEFT? (3, 7).\n    (3, 7) is my current body (tail).\n    If I go LEFT, I go into my tail.\n    The tail moves forward to (4, 7).\n    Does the tail vacate the cell before I enter it?\n    In simultaneous movement, yes, usually the tail moves.\n    However, the rules say \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself\".\n    Since my body is only one segment long, and it's directly behind me, moving LEFT is \"directly backwards\".\n    So I should avoid LEFT.\n\n    So, UP, DOWN, RIGHT are safe.\n    I prefer RIGHT.\n\n    Write plan.\n    \"Moving towards the central apple at (6, 6) to score a point quickly. The path is clear and the enemy is too far away to contest it.\"\n\n    Move: RIGHT.\n    Plan: Write plan.\n\n    Wait, the prompt asks me to write the plan *before* the final move line.\n    \"You may also write a short long-term plan... This plan will be shown back to you... Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n\n    So:\n    [Plan]\n    [Move]\n\n    The plan should be a single thought. I'll stick to the \"Chase center apple\" logic.\n\n    Final decision: RIGHT.\n    \n    Double check the apple locations.\n    (4, 0), (5, 0) - Bottom. Contested.\n    (8, 9) - Top Right. Safe, far.\n    (7, 3) - Bottom Right. Contested (near enemy body).\n    (6, 6) - Center. Safe, close.\n    \n    Yes, (6, 6) is the best target.\n    Getting to (6, 6) requires moving RIGHT (to 5, 7) or DOWN (to 4, 6).\n    Moving RIGHT puts me at (5, 7). From there I can go DOWN to (5, 6).\n    Moving DOWN puts me at (4, 6). From there I can go RIGHT to (5, 6).\n    \n    Moving RIGHT now keeps me at y=7. Moving DOWN puts me at y=6.\n    The enemy is at y=1.\n    y=7 is safer than y=6?\n    Only marginally.\n    But moving RIGHT avoids the column x=4 where the enemy body is concentrated.\n    The enemy body is at x=3,4,5,6,7.\n    Moving to x=5 (which I am already at... wait, I am at x=4).\n    Moving to x=5 puts me into the \"range\" of the enemy's body x-range.\n    But the enemy body is at y=2,3,4,5.\n    I am at y=7.\n    So it's fine.\n\n    I will go RIGHT.\n\n    One alternative: UP to (4, 8).\n    If I go UP, I am safe.\n    But I am not progressing towards an apple.\n    (8, 9) is the only apple reachable by going UP/RIGHT mostly.\n    (6, 6) is closer.\n    I will go for (6, 6).\n\n    So, RIGHT.\n    \n    One final check on \"Future options\".\n    Right -> (5, 7).\n    Next turn options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n    I can go DOWN to (5, 6). (5, 6) is empty.\n    I can go DOWN -> (5, 6) -> RIGHT to (6, 6). Eaten.\n    \n    This seems like a solid plan.\n\n    I'll write the plan to be clear.\n    \"Targeting the central apple at (6,6). Moving RIGHT to get into position to approach from above.\"\n\n    Move: RIGHT.\n\n    Wait, \"You may also write a short long-term plan... Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n    \n    Long-Term Plan:\n    Targeting the central apple at (6,6). Moving RIGHT to get into position to approach from above.\n    \n    Final Move:\n    RIGHT\n\n    Wait, I should check the coordinates again.\n    (4, 7) -> (5, 7).\n    (5, 7) is valid.\n    \n    I am confident in this.\n\n    One thing: The prompt says \"My next move will likely be UP to (3, 8)\" in the previous rationale.\n    This is a typo in the prompt. (3, 8) is not reachable.\n    This confirms I should not blindly follow that specific direction, but evaluate the *intent* (Top-Right).\n    The intent of the previous plan was \"Safety\".\n    My plan is \"Safety + Efficiency\".\n    (6, 6) is safe and efficient.\n    \n    So I proceed with RIGHT.\n\n    Final check on the \"START LONG-TERM PLAN\" in the prompt.\n    It says \"My next move will likely be UP\".\n    If I move RIGHT, I am deviating from that.\n    The prompt allows me to write a NEW plan.\n    So I will write a new plan that justifies RIGHT.\n\n    New Plan: \"I will pursue the apple at (6, 6) which is safer and closer than the top-right apple. I will move RIGHT to approach it.\"\n\n    Move: RIGHT.\n\n    One detail: The prompt says \"My next move will likely be UP to (3, 8)\".\n    If I were at (3, 7), UP would be (3, 8).\n    But I am at (4, 7).\n    This discrepancy suggests the prompt might be from a slightly different state or a typo.\n    Regardless, I must base my move on the CURRENT state: Head (4, 7).\n    \n    Current state: Head (4, 7).\n    Target: (6, 6).\n    Move: RIGHT.\n    \n    Ready.\n\n    One tiny check: Is there any apple closer than (6, 6)?\n    (6, 6) distance is 3.\n    (7, 3) distance is 7.\n    (4, 0) distance is 11.\n    (5, 0) distance is 12.\n    (8, 9) distance is 6.\n    Yes, (6, 6) is the closest.\n\n    I will proceed.\n\n    Plan:\n    Targeting the apple at (6, 6) to score a point quickly. The enemy is far away and occupied with the bottom apples.\n\n    Move:\n    RIGHT\n\n    Wait, I must output only the word.\n    The plan goes before.\n    \n    The prompt says: \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\"\n    \n    So I will write the plan, then the move.\n\n    Wait, the prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan... Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n    This implies the plan is part of the response, separated from the move.\n    \n    So:\n    [Plan text]\n    RIGHT\n    \n    Correct.\n\n    One check: \"You cannot win if you are dead, so never choose a move that obviously kills you.\"\n    (5, 7) is not killing me.\n    \n    \"Among the moves that keep you alive, prefer moves that both: increase your chance of safely eating apples, and keep future options open\"\n    RIGHT increases my chance of eating (6, 6).\n    From (5, 7), I have good future options.\n    \n    Decision: RIGHT.\n\n    Plan text: \"Moving RIGHT to position myself for the apple at (6, 6). This is the closest accessible apple and avoids the enemy's zone.\"\n    \n    Move: RIGHT.\n    \n    Wait, I'll keep the plan short as requested.\n    \"Targeting the apple at (6, 6) to score quickly.\"\n    \n    Move: RIGHT.\n\n    Final check on the board.\n    `7 . . . T 0 . . . . .`\n    Head is the '0'. At (4, 7).\n    Moving RIGHT puts me at (5, 7).\n    Cell (5, 7) is '.'.\n    It is safe.\n\n    Proceed.\n\n    One thought: The prompt says \"My next move will likely be UP to (3, 8)\".\n    This might be a \"trap\" or a \"mistake\" in the prompt that I should ignore?\n    Or maybe I am actually at (3, 7) and the prompt's \"Head: (4, 7)\" is the new head?\n    No, \"Head: (4, 7)\" is the current head.\n    \"Body: [(3, 7)]\".\n    So I am definitely at (4, 7).\n    \n    If I am at (4, 7), I cannot go UP to (3, 8).\n    That requires moving Left and Up simultaneously.\n    So the previous rationale contains a coordinate error.\n    I should rely on my own coordinate math.\n    \n    My math: (4, 7) -> (5, 7).\n    Logic: Eat (6, 6).\n\n    I am set.\n\n    Plan: Targeting the central apple at (6,6) for a safe point.\n    Move: RIGHT.\n\n    Wait, I should check if Snake #1 might move to block me?\n    They are at (3, 1).\n    They can't reach (5, 7) or (6, 6) in time.\n    \n    Good to go.\n\n    Plan.\n    Move.\n\n    Wait, the prompt asks \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\"\n    I have done that in the scratchpad.\n    \n    Final output:\n    [Plan]\n    RIGHT\n\n    I will write the plan inside the tags as requested for the next turn?\n    No, the prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan... This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\n    \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n    So I just write it as text before the move.\n\n    Example:\n    I will go to the apple at (6,6).\n    RIGHT\n\n    Okay.\n\n    One last check on the \"START LONG-TERM PLAN\" in the prompt.\n    It says \"Move towards the apple at (8, 9)\".\n    It also says \"My next move will likely be UP to (3, 8)\".\n    This implies I should move UP.\n    But (6, 6) is a better target.\n    I will trust my analysis over the \"likely\" move in the previous rationale, as it contained a coordinate error and a suboptimal target selection.\n\n    I will go RIGHT.\n\n    Plan: Moving RIGHT to approach the apple at (6,6).\n    Move: RIGHT\n\n    Wait, I can't write \"Plan: ...\" in the final output if I need to write \"RIGHT\".\n    The prompt says: \"You may also write a short long-term plan... Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\n    \n    So:\n    (Plan text)\n    (Move text)\n    \n    The \"Move text\" is just the word.\n    \n    So I will write:\n    Targeting the central apple at (6,6).\n    RIGHT\n\n    (Wait, the prompt example shows \"START LONG-TERM PLAN... END LONG-TERM PLAN\" in the input. It doesn't require me to use those tags. Just \"appear before\".)\n    \n    I will output:\n    [My plan text]\n    RIGHT\n    \n    Correct.\n\n    One check: Is (5, 7) inside the board?\n    x=5 (0-9), y=7 (0-9). Yes.\n\n    Is there any reason to go DOWN?\n    If I go DOWN, I am at (4, 6).\n    From there, I am closer to the bottom.\n    The enemy is at the bottom.\n    Moving RIGHT keeps me higher up.\n    Moving DOWN brings me down to their level.\n    Staying high (RIGHT) seems safer against a snake that is growing at the bottom.\n    \n    So RIGHT is better than DOWN.\n    \n    UP is too slow.\n    LEFT is death.\n    \n    Final decision: RIGHT.\n\n    Plan: Moving towards the apple at (6,6).\n    Move: RIGHT.Moving towards the central apple at (6,6) to score a point quickly. The enemy is currently occupied with the bottom-left apples and cannot contest this position.\n\nRIGHT",

Analyze Coordinates and State:**\n*   **My Snake (ID 0):** Head at `(6, 7)`, Body at `[(5, 7)]`.\n*   **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at `(5, 1)`, Body covers `(3, 1)` to `(6, 4)`.\n*   **Apples:** `(4, 0), (5, 0), (8, 9), (7, 3), (6, 6)`.\n*   **Last Move:** I moved `RIGHT` to reach `(6, 7)`.\n\n**2. Eliminate Lethal Moves (Simultaneous Collision Check):**\nWe must calculate where *our* head will be if we move, and where the *enemy's* head will be if it moves, to check for head-on collisions. The enemy likely wants to eat `(5,0)` or `(4,0)`.\n\n*   **Move UP to (6, 8):**\n    *   Enemy Head possible locations: `(5, 2)` or `(6, 1)`.\n    *   Collision Check: `6, 8` is safe from `5, 2` and `6, 1`. No head-on.\n    *   Board Check: `(6, 8)` is inside the 10x10 board.\n    *   Body Check: My body is at `(5, 7)`. `(6, 8)` is empty.\n    *   **Verdict: SAFE.**\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (6, 6):**\n    *   **Target:** There is an apple here.\n    *   Enemy Head possible locations: `(5, 2)` or `(6, 1)`.\n    *   Collision Check: `6, 6` is safe from `5, 2` and `6, 1`.\n    *   Board Check: `(6, 6)` is inside.\n    *   Body Check: My body is at `(5, 7)`. `(6, 6)` is empty.\n    *   **Verdict: SAFE (and optimal).**\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (5, 7):**\n    *   **Target:** This is my current body segment `(5, 7)`.\n    *   Rules state: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body... counts as hitting yourself and you die.\"\n    *   **Verdict: DEATH.** (Eliminated).\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 7):**\n    *   Enemy Head possible locations: `(5, 2)` or `(6, 1)`.\n    *   Collision Check: `7, 7` is safe from `5, 2` and `6, 1`.\n    *   Board Check: `(7, 7)` is inside.\n    *   Body Check: My body is at `(5, 7)`. `(7, 7)` is empty.\n    *   **Verdict: SAFE.**\n\n**3. Strategy and Selection:**\nWe have two safe moves: `UP` and `DOWN` (and `RIGHT`).\n*   **Move DOWN:** Moves to `(6, 6)`, which contains an apple. This allows me to grow (length 3) and gain a point.\n*   **Move UP:** Moves to `(6, 8)`, an empty space. This provides distance from the enemy (currently at `y=1`) but sacrifices the immediate apple at `(6, 6)`. The central area is getting crowded, and the apple at `(6, 6)` is currently uncontested.\n*   **Move RIGHT:** Moves to `(7, 7)`, empty space. Further from the `(6, 6)` apple.\n\nSince the apple at `(6, 6)` is adjacent, safe from immediate head-on collision (enemy is at `y=1` and cannot reach `y=6` in one turn), and my last move was `RIGHT` (meaning `DOWN` is not a 180\u00b0 turn), `DOWN` is the best choice.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (6,6) to grow. After eating, the tail will not move (growth phase). My new body will be (6,7), (5,7). This effectively blocks the path behind me. I will need to move to open space, likely East to (7,6) or South to (6,5), to avoid getting stuck. I will then look towards the apple at (7,3) if the enemy moves away.\n\nDOWN",

Apples: 9.\n*   **Apples:** `(4, 0), (8, 9), (7, 3), (4, 6), (3, 4)`.\n*   **Board State:**\n    *   My head `(6, 6)` is on an apple.\n    *   Enemy head `(5, 0)` is adjacent to apple `(4, 0)` and `(5, 0)` (though `(5, 0)` is the head itself, likely referencing the apple list `(4, 0)` or `(5, 0)` is actually an apple? The prompt lists apples at `(4, 0)`, `(8, 9)`, `(7, 3)`, `(4, 6)`, `(3, 4)`. The board shows `A` at `(4, 0)` and `(5, 0)` is where the enemy head is. Wait, the apple list in the text doesn't include `(5, 0)`, but the board diagram shows an `A` at `(5, 0)`. I must trust the board diagram. The prompt text \"Apples at: ...\" might be incomplete. The board shows:\n        *   `(4, 0)`: A\n        *   `(5, 0)`: A (Occupied by Enemy Head `1`)\n        *   `(3, 4)`: A\n        *   `(4, 6)`: A\n        *   `(7, 3)`: A\n        *   `(8, 9)`: A\n    *   Wait, checking the board diagram row 0: ` . . . . A 1 . . . .` at `x=4` and `x=5`. So yes, there are apples at `(4, 0)` and `(5, 0)`. Enemy is eating one.\n\n**2. Evaluating Moves for Turn 30:**\nMy current head is `(6, 6)`. I am on an apple `(6, 6)` (confirmed by diagram row 6: ` . . . . A . 0 . . .`).\n\n*   **Move UP to (6, 7):**\n    *   Target: `(6, 7)`.\n    *   Status: My body segment `[(6, 7)]`.\n    *   Outcome: **DEAD** (Self-collision).\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (6, 5):**\n    *   Target: `(6, 5)`.\n    *   Status: Empty.\n    *   Enemy Move Prediction: Enemy at `(5, 0)` likely moves to eat `(4, 0)` or `(5, 0)` (if it's an apple) or `(6, 0)`. Even if they move to `(6, 0)`, distance is huge. No head-on collision.\n    *   Outcome: **SAFE**.\n\n*   **Move LEFT to (5, 6):**\n    *   Target: `(5, 6)`.\n    *   Status: Empty.\n    *   Outcome: **SAFE**.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 6):**\n    *   Target: `(7, 6)`.\n    *   Status: Empty.\n    *   Outcome: **SAFE**.\n\n**3. Strategy and Selection:**\nI am currently on an apple at `(6, 6)`. To score, I must move off the apple and effectively \"collect\" it.\nAmong the safe moves:\n*   **UP (6, 7):** Impossible (suicide).\n*   **DOWN (6, 5):** Moves me south. Opens up the board. `[(6, 6), (6, 7), (5, 7)]` is a valid body state. `(5, 6)` would be open for a subsequent turn. This is a strong move.\n*   **LEFT (5, 6):** Moves me west towards `(4, 6)` (another apple). However, this brings me closer to the center/upper-left where the body is.\n*   **RIGHT (7, 6):** Moves me east. Opens up the right side.\n\nThe safest and most flexible move is **DOWN**. It keeps my tail path open. If I move DOWN, next turn I can likely move LEFT (towards `4,6`) or RIGHT (towards `7,3`). Moving DOWN also avoids potential future congestion in the `(6, 7)` area.\n\n**Long-term Plan:**\nEat the apple at (6,6) by moving DOWN. Pivot to the east (towards 7,3) or west (towards 4,6) depending on enemy movement. Avoid the edges.\n\nDOWN\n**END LAST RATIONALE**\n\nDOWN",

The apple at `(6, 6)` has been collected, so my tail will not grow immediately next turn (standard Snake mechanics apply: growth happens *after* moving onto an apple, usually resulting in the tail not moving for one turn).\n2.  **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at `(4, 0)`. Body: `[(5, 0), (5, 1), (4, 1), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4), (6, 4)]`. It is likely to eat the apple at `(4, 0)` or `(5, 0)`.\n3.  **Apples:** `(8, 9), (7, 3), (4, 6), (3, 4), (3, 5)`. (The apple at `(6, 6)` is gone).\n\n**Analysis:**\n*   **Current Head:** `(6, 5)`.\n*   **Safe Moves:**\n    *   **UP:** `(6, 6)`. This is my current body (previous head). **Deadly.**\n    *   **DOWN:** `(6, 4)`. Let's check the board: Row 4 is ` . . . A T T T . . .` at x=0..6. Specifically, `(6, 4)` is `T` (Enemy Body). **Deadly.**\n    *   **LEFT:** `(5, 5)`. Empty on the board. No snake body is there. **Safe.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** `(7, 5)`. Empty on the board. **Safe.**\n\n*   **Comparison of Safe Moves (LEFT vs RIGHT):**\n    *   **Target LEFT (5, 5):**\n        *   Closest apple: `(4, 6)` is distance 2 (diagonal: Left 1, Up 1). `(3, 4)` is distance 2 (Left 2, Down 1).\n        *   Direction: Moving towards the center-left, where the enemy snake has a heavy presence (body spans x=3 to x=6). High risk of getting boxed in.\n    *   **Target RIGHT (7, 5):**\n        *   Closest apple: `(7, 3)` is distance 2 (Down 2). `(8, 9)` is further.\n        *   Direction: Moving towards the right side of the board. The right side is currently clear. This provides more space to maneuver and escape.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    The right side is significantly safer and has a clear path to the apple at `(7, 3)`. Moving LEFT brings me closer to the enemy snake's tail and potential traffic. I will move RIGHT to secure space.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Move RIGHT to `(7, 5)`. From there, target the apple at `(7, 3)` or `(8, 9)`. Maintain distance from Enemy #1.\n\nRIGHT\n**END LONG-TERM PLAN**\n\nRIGHT",

Body: `[(7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5)]`.\n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at `(1, 1)`. Body spans from `x=2` to `x=5`. Based on the previous turn's logic and board state, the enemy snake's body occupies `(2, 1)`, `(3, 1)`, `(4, 1)`, and extends down to `(5, 0)`. The `T` at `(2, 0)` confirms the tail is at `(5, 0)`.\n- **Apples:** `(8, 9)`, `(4, 6)`, `(3, 4)`, `(3, 5)`, `(3, 9)`.\n\n**Move Evaluation (Head at `7,2`):**\n1.  **UP (`7, 3`):** My body is at `(7, 3)`. **DEADLY** (Self-collision).\n2.  **DOWN (`7, 1`):** The board state shows `(7, 1)` as `.` (empty). **Safe**.\n3.  **LEFT (`6, 2`):** The board state shows `(6, 2)` as `T`. This is the body of Enemy #1 (specifically, the segment connecting the main body to the tail at `(5, 0)`). **UNSAFE** (Collision).\n4.  **RIGHT (`8, 2`):** The board state shows `(8, 2)` as `.` (empty). **Safe**.\n\n**Decision:**\nEliminate UP (self-collision) and LEFT (enemy body).\nWe are left with DOWN (`7, 1`) and RIGHT (`8, 2`).\n- **Strategic Goal:** The highest value target is the apple at `(8, 9)`. To reach the top-right area safely, I need to navigate around the central blockage formed by Enemy #1.\n- **Path Analysis:** Enemy #1 is currently blocking the left side (`x=1` to `x=5`) and particularly the vertical path at `x=6` down to `y=0`. Moving **DOWN** to `(7, 1)` brings me closer to the bottom edge and potentially allows me to slide under the enemy's tail at `(5, 0)` if they move away. However, this risks getting trapped at the bottom if the enemy descends further.\n- **Safer Alternative:** Moving **RIGHT** to `(8, 2)` keeps me in the open column `x=8`, which leads directly to the apple at `(8, 9)`. It maintains distance from the enemy cluster on the left. While it creates a gap from my tail, the board is open at the top right, providing ample space to maneuver later. This move prioritizes safety and direct access to the scoring zone.\n\n**Conclusion:** RIGHT is the safest move that aligns with the long-term goal of collecting the apple at `(8, 9)`.\n**END CURRENT MOVE RATIONALE**\n\nRIGHT",

While the edge is often a safe boundary, it limits future movement options (I cannot move Right again). The apple is at `x=8`, so moving Right takes me further away in the x-dimension.

Let's verify the head position `Head: (8, 7)`. The grid shows a `0` in the row labeled `7`, but in the column under `8` (which is the 9th column). The grid shows `7 . . . . . A . . . .`. The `0` is in the row labeled `6`. This confirms the `Head: (8, 6)` in the prompt text is likely the ground truth for the *current* state, while the `Board state` represents a snapshot from the previous turn or has an alignment issue. However, the `Board state` shows `0` at `(8, 6)` which matches the `Head: (8, 6)` in the \"Your snake\" section. The `Body: [(8, 6)]` in the prompt text is likely a typo for `(8, 5)`. The `Board state` shows `T` (Tail) at `(8, 5)`.\n\nLet's assume the `Board state` and the `Head: (8, 6)` coordinate are the correct references for the grid layout.\nThe grid uses (x, y) coordinates where x is the column (0-9) and y is the row (0-9).\nThe Head is at `(8, 6)`. The Body is listed as `[(8, 6), (8, 5), (8, 4)]` which is contradictory (Head cannot be part of the body list). However, the `Board state` visualizes:\n*   Head at `(8, 6)` (Row 6, Col 8).\n*   Tail at `(8, 5)` (Row 5, Col 8).\n*   Body continues at `(8, 4)` (Row 4, Col 8).\n\nLet's check the moves relative to Head `(8, 6)`:\n1.  **UP (8, 7):** The grid shows Row 7, Col 8 is empty (`. `).\n2.  **DOWN (8, 5):** The grid shows Row 5, Col 8 is `T` (My tail). **DEADLY**.\n3.  **LEFT (7, 6):** The grid shows Row 6, Col 7 is empty (`. `).\n4.  **RIGHT (9, 6):** The grid shows Row 6, Col 9 is empty (`. `).\n\nThe target apple is at `(8, 9)`. Moving UP gets closer.\nThe apple at `(3, 9)` is also visible.\nThe apple at `(4, 6)` is to the left and slightly down.\nThe apple at `(8, 9)` is the most direct path.\n\n**Rationale:**\nI am at `(8, 6)`.\n- **UP** to `(8, 7)` is clear.\n- **DOWN** to `(8, 5)` is blocked by my own tail.\n- **LEFT** to `(7, 6)` is clear.\n- **RIGHT** to `(9, 6)` is clear.\n\nThe apple at `(8, 9)` is directly North. Moving UP is the best approach. The path `(8, 7)` -> `(8, 8)` -> `(8, 9)` is currently clear. The enemy snake is far away (at x=3, y=4) and poses no immediate threat.\n\nMoving UP is safe and aligns with the goal of eating the closest apple.\n\nUP",

If I move there, I reduce my maneuverability significantly.\n(7, 9) is on the top edge but not a corner. From there, I will have three possible moves (Left, Down, Right).

I need to move away from $(8, 9)$.\n2.  **Board Boundaries:** The board is $10 \\times 10$, with coordinates $0$ to $9$.\n3.  **Enemy Snake #1:** Head is at $(5, 6)$. Its body occupies $(4, 6)$ through $(4, 0)$. Specifically for this turn, its body occupies $(4, 6)$, $(4, 5)$, $(3, 5)$, $(3, 4)$, $(3, 3)$, $(2, 3)$, $(1, 3)$, $(1, 2)$, $(1, 1)$, $(2, 1)$, $(2, 0)$, $(3, 0)$, $(4, 0)$.\n\n**Evaluating Moves from $(7, 9)$:**\n\n*   **UP (to (7, 10)):** Off the board. **Unsafe.**\n*   **DOWN (to (7, 8)):** This cell is currently empty (shown as `.` on the board map). It is on the board. **Safe.**\n*   **LEFT (to (6, 9)):** This cell is currently empty. **Safe.**\n*   **RIGHT (to (8, 9)):** This is my current tail position. However, I must consider simultaneous movement. My tail will move to $(7, 9)$ (my current head position) only *after* I move. Effectively, I am moving into the space my body is vacating, which is standard safe movement in Snake.\n\n**Strategic Reasoning:**\n\n*   **Survival:** All three moves (DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) are immediately safe.\n*   **Future Options:**\n    *   *RIGHT (to 8,9):* This keeps me pinned against the wall with only two escape routes (DOWN or LEFT). This is a \"dead end\" maneuver.\n    *   *LEFT (to 6,9):* This moves me away from the wall, opening up the top row.\n    *   *DOWN (to 7,8):* This moves me off the top row into the open board area.\n*   **Apple Proximity:**\n    *   From $(7, 9)$, I am adjacent to the apple at $(7, 7)$. Moving **DOWN** to $(7, 8)$ brings me closer to this apple and positions me perfectly to eat it next turn by moving **DOWN** again to $(7, 7)$.\n    *   I am also close to the apple at $(5, 7)$. From $(7, 8)$, I can navigate toward it.\n*   **Enemy Safety:** Enemy Snake #1 is at $(5, 6)$. My potential moves do not threaten immediate collision with its current body or its likely movement range in one turn.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving **DOWN** is the most proactive choice. It avoids getting trapped against the wall and aligns me perfectly to collect the apple at $(7, 7)$ on the next turn, which is a valuable and safe objective.\n\nDOWN",
