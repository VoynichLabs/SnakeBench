Safe.\n- **LEFT:** (3, 8). Safe.\n- **RIGHT:** (5, 8).

If I move toward (8, 7), Snake #1 is currently 6 blocks away from it (3 right, 3 up). We are roughly equal distance from that apple.\n\n3. **Decision:**\n- Moving **RIGHT** to (5, 8) puts me in the same column as the enemy but 4 units above.\n- Moving **DOWN** to (4, 7) puts me on the same row as the apple at (8, 7). This seems the most efficient pathing towards the center-right apple while keeping options open for the center-left.\n\n**Strategy Note:**\nTargeting the apple at (8, 7) first.

Enemy Analysis:**\nSnake 1 is at (2, 1). Its body is [(1, 1), (1, 0)]. It is very close to (3, 2) and far from my current cluster. It will likely head UP or RIGHT towards (3, 2). There is no immediate threat of collision.\n\n**4. Strategic Choice:**\nMoving **LEFT** toward (7, 4) or **DOWN** toward (8, 3) are both good. I will choose **DOWN** to (8, 3). From (8, 3), I am adjacent to both (7, 3) and (9, 3). This allows me to react to the board state on the next turn and decide which apple to grab first based on where Snake 1 moves. Heading for (7, 3) first is generally better as it is more central.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove to (8, 3), then collect (7, 3) and (9, 3). After securing these two, evaluate the position of Snake 1. If Snake 1 has taken (3, 2), I will head toward (1, 5) and (1, 6) across the top or middle of the board to prevent Snake 1 from boxing me in.\n\nDOWN",

RIGHT: Move to (3, 1) - safe move, moves toward the apple at (3, 2)\n\nThe safe moves are UP, DOWN, and RIGHT. The enemy snake at (8, 4) is far from my current position, so there's no immediate collision risk.\n\nLooking at the distances to the apples:\n- (3, 2): distance of 1 (closest)\n- (1, 5): distance of 4\n- (1, 6): distance of 5\n- (7, 3): distance of 5\n- (9, 3): distance of 7\n\nThe apple at (3, 2) is the closest.

Moving DOWN to (2, 0) moves away from all apples.\n\nRIGHT is the best choice as it:\n- Is safe (not into my own body, not into enemy body, within board boundaries)\n- Moves me closer to the nearest apple (3, 2)\n- Gives me more flexibility for future moves\n- Keeps me in open space\n\nRIGHT",

UP: Moving to (3, 4) - safe, not into my body or enemy body\n2. DOWN: Moving to (3, 2) - would hit my own body - suicidal\n3. LEFT: Moving to (2, 3) - safe\n4. RIGHT: Moving to (4, 3) - safe\n\nThe safe moves are UP, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let me evaluate which is best:\n\n- UP to (3, 4): Moves me away from apples, but keeps me in a central position\n- LEFT to (2, 3): Moves me away from most apples, closer to board edge\n- RIGHT to (4, 3): Moves me closer to the apple at (5, 3), and also keeps me in a central position\n\nRIGHT seems best as it:\n1. Moves me closer to the apple at (5, 3)\n2. Maintains central position\n3. Keeps future options open\n\nThe enemy snake has more apples (5 vs my 3), so I need to focus on eating apples to catch up. Moving RIGHT positions me well to reach the apple at (5, 3) in the next few turns.\n\nI should also consider potential enemy moves. The enemy snake is at (6, 3) and could move to (5, 3) to eat that apple. If I move to (4, 3), I'll be closer to the apple and might be able to get it before the enemy snake.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible moves:\n- UP: (6, 4)\n- DOWN: (6, 2)\n- LEFT: (5, 3) - could eat the apple at (5, 3)\n- RIGHT: (7, 3)\n\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (5, 3), they would eat the apple. If I move RIGHT to (4, 3), I'll be one step closer to that apple and might be able to get it on the next turn if the enemy doesn't eat it this turn.\n\nI should also consider the apple at (1, 5) and (1, 6), but those are quite far away. The apple at (9, 3) is also far away. The apple at (0, 2) is close to my body but not directly accessible.\n\nGiven all this, RIGHT seems like the best move as it positions me to potentially eat the apple at (5, 3) and keeps me in a good central position.\n\nRIGHT\nRIGHT",

The enemy snake is at (5, 3) and could move to (4, 3) to eat me. But since I'm at (4, 3) and moving to (5, 3) would be a head-on collision, the enemy might avoid that.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible moves:\n- UP: (5, 4)\n- DOWN: (5, 2)\n- LEFT: (4, 3) - would collide with my head\n- RIGHT: (6, 3)\n\nIf the enemy moves LEFT to (4, 3), we would both die in a head-on collision.

Keep future options open\n\nMoving UP to (4, 4) seems better than DOWN to (4, 2) because:\n- It moves me away from the enemy snake\n- It keeps me in a more central position\n- It opens up more options for future moves\n\nI should also consider that the enemy snake has a longer body and might be more constrained in its movements. By moving up, I might be able to position myself to eventually get around them or reach apples that they can't access.\n\nSo my decision is to move UP.\nUP",

If the enemy continues UP, I will pivot LEFT as soon as a 1-tile gap is established.\n\nUP",

Moves away from the enemy.\n- **LEFT (4, 6):** **CAUTION**. The enemy head is at (3, 5). They can move UP to (3, 6) or LEFT to (2, 5). They cannot move RIGHT to (4, 5) as that is their own body. If I move LEFT to (4, 6) and they move UP to (4, 6), we would have a head-on collision. However, looking at the coordinates, if their body is [(4, 5), (4, 4), (4, 3)], they can move to (3, 6) or (2, 5). Wait, looking at the board: Their head is at (3, 5). Their body is at (4, 5). They cannot move RIGHT to (4, 5). They can move UP (3, 6), DOWN (3, 4), or LEFT (2, 5). \n\n**2. Strategy and Apple Distance:**\nApples: (1, 5), (1, 6), (9, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1).\n- My current position (5, 6) is well-positioned to head LEFT toward the (1, 6) and (1, 5) cluster.\n- The enemy at (3, 5) is closer to those apples.\n- If I move LEFT to (4, 6), I am only 3 spaces from (1, 6).\n- If I move UP to (5, 7), I keep my options open but get slightly further from the apples.\n- Moving LEFT (4, 6) puts me in a position to potentially cut off Snake #1 or race them for the top-left apples. Since Snake #1's head is at (3, 5), and their body is to their right at (4, 5), they are currently facing \"Away\" from me or towards the left.\n\n**3. Risk Assessment:**\nBy moving LEFT (4, 6), I am moving above the enemy. There is no risk of a head-on collision this turn because the enemy's possible moves are (3, 6), (3, 4), or (2, 5). None of those are (4, 6).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\nMove LEFT to (4, 6) to begin closing the distance to the apple at (1, 6). I will monitor Snake #1's movement; if they move towards (1, 5), I will attempt to secure (1, 6) and then potentially head down to (0, 2) and (0, 1) or loop back toward (9, 3).\n\nLEFT",

Evaluate Possible Moves for Head (3, 6):**\n- **UP (3, 7):** Safe. Moves into open space.\n- **DOWN (3, 5):** **INVALID**. This is Snake #1's body.\n- **RIGHT (4, 6):** **INVALID**. This is my own neck.\n- **LEFT (2, 6):** **CAUTION**. Snake #1 is at (1, 5). They could move UP to (1, 6) or LEFT to (0, 5). If they move UP to (1, 6), they would be adjacent to (2, 6). If we both move to (2, 6) in the future, it's a risk, but for this specific turn, (2, 6) is empty and safe. However, Snake #1 is currently at (1, 5). If they move UP, they go to (1, 6) (an apple). If I move LEFT to (2, 6), I am only 1 step from them.\n\n**2. Strategy and Apple Distance:**\nApples: (1, 6), (9, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0).\n- Enemy #1 is at (1, 5). They are 1 step from apple (1, 6).\n- If I move LEFT to (2, 6), I am also 1 step from apple (1, 6). If we both move to (1, 6) next turn, we both die (head-on collision).\n- Given the score (6 to 4), I don't need to take 50/50 risks for a single apple if it results in a draw/loss. However, moving LEFT keeps pressure on that apple.\n- Moving UP to (3, 7) is the \"safest\" path to avoid a head-on collision at (1, 6) next turn, but it gives the apple away for free.\n\n**3. Risk Assessment:**\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 6):\n- If Snake #1 moves UP to (1, 6), they get the apple. Next turn, we would be at (2, 6) and (1, 6).\n- If Snake #1 moves LEFT to (0, 5), I am closer to the apple.\n- The real danger is if I go LEFT and they go UP, they are likely to take (1, 6). If I move UP now, I can loop around or head towards the clusters at (0, 0)-(0, 2).\n\nHowever, moving LEFT (2, 6) is tactically superior to block their expansion or contest the area. Going UP (3, 7) is very passive. If I go LEFT and they take the apple at (1, 6), I can then pivot DOWN or UP.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT to (2, 6). This puts me in a position to contest (1, 6) or move towards the cluster at (0, 0-2). I must watch Snake #1's head at (1, 5) carefully to avoid a head-on collision at (1, 6) on turn 22.\n\nLEFT",

UP: Move to (1, 6)\n   - Safe: Within board boundaries\n   - Not into my own body (my body is at (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (4, 4))\n   - Not into enemy's body (enemy body is at (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3))\n   - Moves directly to the apple at (1, 6)\n\n2. DOWN: Move to (1, 4)\n   - Safe: Within board boundaries\n   - Not into my own body\n   - Not into enemy's body\n   - This would move away from the apples\n\n3. LEFT: Move to (0, 5)\n   - Safe: Within board boundaries\n   - Not into my own body\n   - Not into enemy's body\n   - This would move away from the apples\n\n4. RIGHT: Move to (2, 5)\n   - Safe: Within board boundaries\n   - Not into my own body (this is where my body segment is, but it's not my head's current position)\n   - Not into enemy's body\n   - This would move back to where my head was last turn\n\nBetween the safe options (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT), I need to consider which is best:\n\n- UP (1, 6) is the most attractive because it moves me directly to the apple at (1, 6)\n- DOWN (1, 4) and LEFT (0, 5) don't seem to move me toward any apples\n- RIGHT (2, 5) would move me back to where my head was last turn\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake's position and potential moves. The enemy snake's head is at (3, 6), and its body extends to (4, 6), (5, 6), (5, 5), (5, 4), (5, 3), (6, 3). The enemy snake has 6 apples, which is more than my 4 apples, so I should be cautious about potential collisions.\n\nLooking at the board, I can see that:\n- The apple at (1, 6) is one step up from my current position\n- The apple at (9, 3) is far away in the opposite direction\n- The apples at (0, 2), (0, 1), and (0, 0) are also far away\n\nI think UP is the best move because:\n- It moves me directly to the apple at (1, 6)\n- It keeps me away from the enemy snake\n- It maintains a clear path toward the apple\n\nMy plan for the next few turns:\n- Move up to eat the apple at (1, 6)\n- After reaching that apple, assess the board for the next target\n- Continue avoiding the enemy snake while collecting apples\n\nUP",

This is my own neck.\n- **LEFT (1, 6):** **DANGER**. This is Snake #1's head position. If they move to any other cell, I would hit their head/body. If they stay (not possible), I hit them. If I move here, I am moving into their head or current body segment.\n\n**2. Tactical Situation:**\nSnake #1 just moved onto the apple that was at (1, 6). Their head is now at (1, 6).\n- If I move **UP** to (2, 7): I am safe. I move away from the immediate conflict and can look toward the cluster of apples at (0, 0), (0, 1), and (0, 2).\n- If I move **LEFT** to (1, 6): I will collide with Snake #1's head (if they move out) or their body (if they move UP/DOWN). Specifically, moving into a cell that an opponent's head just occupied is extremely risky because if they don't move or if we move into the same spot, I die. At (1, 6), they are likely to move UP (1, 7) or LEFT (0, 6). \n\n**3. Strategy and Apple Distance:**\nApples are at: (9, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0), (9, 1).\n- Snake #1 is blocking the direct path to the (0, X) apples.\n- By moving **UP** to (2, 7), I can then swing LEFT and DOWN around Snake #1 to reach (0, 2), (0, 1), and (0, 0), or I can head RIGHT toward (9, 3) and (9, 1).\n- Given the score is 6 to 5, I am leading. Safety is priority. Moving UP ensures I don't collide with the enemy snake who is currently adjacent to me.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove UP to (2, 7) to clear the immediate proximity of Snake #1. From there, evaluate if I can cut across to the left wall or if I should head to the right side of the board.\n\nUP",
