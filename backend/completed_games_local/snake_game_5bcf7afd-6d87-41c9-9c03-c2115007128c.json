This is my tail, but it is also my body. Moving here is moving directly backwards into my own body. Instant death.\n- **LEFT**: Moves to (4, 5). This is safe and empty. It moves me closer to the apple cluster at x=1.\n- **RIGHT**: Moves to (6, 5). This is my current neck/body. Instant death.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe only safe moves are **UP** and **LEFT**. \nMoving **UP** to (5, 6) is extremely dangerous because the enemy head is currently there. If the enemy moves to (5, 7), (4, 6), or (6, 6), I might occupy (5, 6), but it puts me in a contested space adjacent to the enemy.\nMoving **LEFT** to (4, 5) is safe. The enemy is at (5, 6) and can move to (4, 6), (5, 7), or (6, 6). None of those moves reach (4, 5). This move creates distance from the enemy and positions me to sweep the apples at (1, 3), (1, 2), and (1, 0).\n\nStrategy:\nMove LEFT to (4, 5). My goal is to navigate to the apple cluster at (1, 3), (1, 2), and (1, 0) while maintaining distance from Snake #1. I will prioritize the western apples to increase my score lead.\n\nLEFT",

DOWN to (5,5) leads to head-on collision with enemy head at (5,5), killing both (unacceptable suicide). No body to hit, and board limits aren't an issue. Enemy snake is nearby (head at (5,5), body nearby), so I must avoid moves risking mutual head collision or intentional body blocks, but their focus on apples (possibly the (2,9)) gives me leeway.

UP keeps me in-place x-wise, farther away, reducing immediate apple access. RIGHT strays opposite to targets, limiting future efficiency. Prioritizing LEFT for progress while retaining broad options (e.g., zigzag down if needed) aligns with anti-suicide rules and earning from remaining 5 apples.\n\n### FUTUR TWO-MOVE OUTLINE\nFrom (4,6), next likely LEFT to (3,6) or briefly UP/DOWN for positioning\u2014continue leftward rushing to x=1 (e.g., (3,6)\u2192(2,6)\u2192(1,6)) to reach (1,9) or (2,9) first (eat lowest if threats emerge). Elbow leftmost column for stacked apples, using growth turns to loop verticals (|y|-axis mobility: 1-9 range ideal for laps); if enemy heels closely (e.g., follows RIGHT then LEFT), consider LEFT UP zigzag for spacing.

(1,6), Body: none, Apples: 0\\n\\n\\n## Examining Game State  \\n- My snake (ID 1) has its head at position (1,6) with no body segments and zero apples.  \\n- The enemy snake (#0) has its head at (2,4), a body at [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5)], and has collected 3 apples.  \\n- There are apples located at (1,2), (1,3), (1,0), and (1,9), with another at (2,9).\\n\\n## Examining Game State  \\n- The game board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right.  \\n- My last move was LEFT from (2,6) to (1,6), which matches the current board state.  \\n- All possible moves from (1,6)\u2014UP to (1,7), DOWN to (1,5), LEFT to (0,6), RIGHT to (2,6)\u2014are within bounds.  \\n\\n## Checking Move Safety  \\n- No risk of moving off the board, as all moves stay within 0-9.  \\n- I have no body, so no collision with my own body is possible.  \\n- Enemy body at (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), and head at (2,4), so no immediate collision with their current positions.  \\n\\n## Considering Enemy Movement  \\n- Moves happen simultaneously, so the enemy's next move could affect future positions.  \\n- My move to (2,6) is currently empty, but enemy body at (2,5) suggests their head might shift, requiring caution.\\n\\n## Assessing Enemy's Past Movement  \\n- The enemy's head was previously at (2,5) with body at [(3,5), (4,5), (5,5)], but now shows head at (2,4) and body at [(2,5), (3,5), (4,5)].  \\n- This suggests the enemy moved up, and their body shifted, likely due to collecting 3 apples, maintaining 4 total segments (head + 3 body segments).  \\n\\n## Evaluating Move Strategy  \\n- From (1,6), moving UP to (1,7) is safe and moves toward the apple at (1,9), keeping options open at x=1.  \\n- Apples are clustered at x=1 (y=2,3,0,9) and (2,9), so prioritizing moves along x=1 or toward (2,9) could help catch up to the enemy\u2019s lead.\\n\\n## Evaluating Move Strategy  \\n- Moving DOWN to (1,5) reaches apples at y=2,3,0 but is less efficient, as closer apples like (1,9) are above.  \\n- Prioritizing UP to (1,9) then RIGHT to (2,9) allows eating two apples in fewer moves, keeping the strategy to grow quickly.  \\n\\n## Planning Apple Collection  \\n- From (1,6), moving UP to (1,7) starts the path to (1,9), taking 3 moves, then 1 move RIGHT to (2,9).  \\n- Going RIGHT to (2,6) then UP to (2,9) takes 4 moves and misses apples at x=1, making it less optimal.\\n\\n## Evaluating Move Strategy  \\n- Staying at x=1 is optimal for eating apples at y=9, 3, 2, 0, while moving right risks missing these.  \\n- Going down to (1,5) then (1,4), (1,3), (1,2), (1,1), (1,0) would eat 4 apples, but leaves (1,9) uneaten.  \\n\\n## Planning Apple Collection  \\n- Prioritizing UP from (1,6) to (1,7) then (1,9) ensures eating the apple at y=9 first, aligning with the strategy.  \\n- After eating (1,9) and moving RIGHT to (2,9), the next move is uncertain, as lower apples at x=1 require returning, which may be inefficient.\\n\\n## Planning Apple Collection\\n- From (1,6), consider a zigzag approach at x=1: UP to (1,9), eat, then DOWN to (1,3), (1,2), (1,0) to eat lower apples efficiently.\\n- This strategy ensures all apples at x=1 (y=9, 3, 2, 0) are eaten before addressing (2,9), potentially reducing travel distance.\\n\\n## Evaluating Efficiency\\n- Eating lower apples first (y=0,2,3) from (1,6) DOWN to (1,0) is closer in y-direction, but leaves (1,9) and (2,9) for later.\\n- After eating lower apples, reaching (1,9) and (2,9) from (1,0) requires moving up and right, which may be less efficient than prioritizing higher apples first.\\n\\n## Evaluating Body Mechanics  \\n- Eating an apple adds a new segment to the body, typically at the previous head position, extending the snake's length.  \\n- Moving into own body, meaning the rear segments, results in death, so planning moves must avoid these occupied cells.  \\n\\n## Planning Apple Collection  \\n- After eating at (1,9) and moving right to (2,9), going down from (2,9) lacks apples, making it inefficient.  \\n- Returning left to (1,9) after eating is impossible due to the body blocking, requiring a strategy to eat lower apples before moving right.\\n\\n## Understanding Body Growth  \\n- Eating an apple updates the body list, adding the previous head position as a new segment, ordered head-to-tail.  \\n- For example, moving UP from (1,8) to (1,9) and eating, the body becomes [(1,8)], with (1,9) as the new head.  \\n\\n## Evaluating Move Consequences  \\n- Moving RIGHT from (1,9) to (2,9) and eating adds (1,9) to the body, making it [(1,9), (1,8)].  \\n- Going LEFT from (2,9) to (1,9) is impossible, as (1,9) is now part of the body, causing death.  \\n\\n## Planning Apple Collection  \\n- Returning to x=1 to eat lower apples after reaching (2,9) is blocked by the body, limiting further apple collection.  \\n- Eating lower apples first at x=1, then moving up, could allow reaching (1,9) and (2,9) without body conflicts.\\n\\n## Understanding Body Growth  \\n- When eating an apple, the snake's length increases, adding a new segment at the previous head position, maintaining head-to-tail order.  \\n- For a length-1 snake, eating places the tail at the position the head moved from, like moving DOWN to (1,3), eating, and setting body to [(1,4)].  \\n\\n## Simulating Movement  \\n- Moving without eating shifts the body, with the tail following the previous segment's position, maintaining continuity.  \\n- Eating at (1,2) after moving DOWN from (1,3) adds (1,3) to the body, resulting in [(1,3), (1,4)], with the tail staying at (1,4).\\n\\n## Analyzing Movement Rules  \\n- The snake's body consists of occupied cells, including the head and tail, forming a list from head to tail.  \\n- Moving into any occupied cell, including your own body's cells, results in death, as per the rules.  \\n\\n## Understanding Collision Avoidance  \\n- Moving backwards directly into the cell behind the head counts as hitting yourself, leading to death.  \\n- When choosing a move, the new head position must not be in any snake's occupied cells, ensuring collision avoidance.\\n\\n## Assessing Tail Movement  \\n- The head can move to the current tail position, as the tail will vacate it when not eating, making the cell empty.  \\n- If eating, the tail doesn't move, so moving to the tail cell could cause a collision, but rules suggest this needs clarification.  \\n\\n## Clarifying Collision Rules  \\n- Moving directly backwards into the cell behind the head counts as hitting yourself, leading to death, as per the rules.  \\n- You can likely move to any direction not into occupied cells, except possibly the tail, depending on whether eating or not, due to simultaneous movement.\\n\\n## Evaluating Move Validity  \\n- Collision is checked after all snakes move, comparing new head positions to bodies at that moment.  \\n- For own body, moving to a currently occupied cell may be allowed if the tail vacates it during the move.  \\n\\n## Clarifying Own Body Movement  \\n- Moving to the current tail position is likely valid, as the tail shifts, leaving the cell empty.  \\n- Without a body initially, all adjacent cells are empty, simplifying move choices.\\n\\n## Planning Apple Collection  \\n- Eating apples requires avoiding getting trapped with unreachable food; prioritize lower apples first to maintain access.  \\n- Starting at (1,6), moving DOWN to eat at (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), then (1,2), and finally (1,1), (1,0) ensures a sequential path.  \\n\\n## Strategizing Body Position  \\n- After eating lower apples, the body forms along the column, with the tail at (1,0), simplifying upward movement.  \\n- Moving up after eating lower apples avoids loops, keeping the path clear for reaching upper apples like (1,9).\\n\\n## Simulating Move Sequence  \\n- Starting with no body, moving DOWN from (1,6) to (1,5) keeps the body empty.  \\n- Continuing DOWN to (1,4), then to (1,3) and eating, the body grows to include (1,4), with the head at (1,3).  \\n\\n## Tracking Body Growth  \\n- After eating at (1,2), the body expands to [(1,3),(1,4)], with the head at (1,2) and tail at (1,4).  \\n- Moving DOWN to (1,1) without eating shifts the body, but the tail's movement depends on the direction, complicating tracking.  \\n\\n## Assessing Loop Risks  \\n- If moving down to (1,0), the body occupies the path from (1,6) to (1,0), including cells like (1,1).  \\n- Attempting to move UP from (1,0) to (1,1) would cause a collision, as (1,1) is part of the body, leading to death.\", type='summary_text')],

From there, I can continue moving DOWN to (1, 2) and (1, 0) to collect more apples.

However, moving RIGHT toward (2, 3) creates a slightly more complex path.

This aligns with the short-term plan of eating (4,8) to build a small lead over the enemy (now 6 apples). From the new position (4,8), multiple safe follow-ups exist: LEFT back to (3,8), DOWN to (4,7), or even RIGHT to (5,8) if empty. This position in column 4 provides escape options away from the enemy territory (columns 1-3 rows 1-3). The enemy snake (#0, length 7, head at (3,1)) is likely moving up toward the midline/upper board this turn (e.g., UP to (3,2) for growth), so RIGHT keeps distance without risking a head-on collision.\n  \n- LEFT to (2,8) is safe but doesn't eat an apple immediately, leaving me stuck at 2 apples while the enemy could eat (e.g., moving UP to (4,1) apple). It traps me in column 2, reducing future freedom and potentially backing me toward lower rows where the enemy might chase. Not ideal for growth or space preservation.\n\n- DOWN to (3,7) is safe but ignores the apple, keeping me at 2 apples and in column 3 (potentially closer to enemy paths if they zig right). It offers vertical freedom but doesn't capitalize on the easy eat nearby.\n\nRIGHT is the strongest choice: it eats the apple, maintains distance from the enemy (whose body occupies columns 1-3 rows 2-3), and preserves board freedom by not committing to narrow columns prematurely. No traps here; the upper-right area (rows 7-9, columns 4-7+) is relatively open.\n\nShort-term plan for next turns: After eating (4,8) and growing, prioritize zigzagging left from (4,8) (e.g., DOWN to (4,7) to clear space, then LEFT to (3,7) or continue DOWN). Target the upper-left apples like (1,5) or (0,6) while monitoring enemy head for potential head-ons\u2014assume they might chase up midline (columns 2-4) so mirror and dodge if needed.

If enemy follows midline up (e.g., UP to (4,2)), no immediate head-on, but it commits to a vulnerable position.\n\n- DOWN to (4,7) aligns with the short-term plan: keeps me in a central column with multiple escapes (LEFT to (3,7), RIGHT to (5,7), DOWN to (4,6), UP back to (4,8)). This heads toward the upper-left apples ((0,6) and (1,5)) by zigzagging left next (e.g., LEFT to (3,7) then DOWN to (3,6) or UP to (3,8) back). Enemy at (4,1) likely moving up (e.g., to (4,2) or RIGHT to (5,1) toward their apple at (9,1)), so this maintains distance without collision risk.

All three are open and not into own or enemy body.\n\n- DOWN to (4,6): Keeps me central with good escape options (LEFT/RIGHT to adjacent columns, further DOWN, UP back). It somewhat advances toward the bottom-left apple at (1,0) or could pivot up later, but doesn't directly approach the upper apples and risks stagnation if enemy heads toward midline (e.g., UP). Maintains distance from enemy's likely path (they're at low y, probably RIGHT for their apple at (9,1)). Safe but less directional toward growth.\n\n- LEFT to (3,7): Aligns with short-term plan to gain leftward space and zigzag toward upper-left apples ((0,6),(1,5)). Creates multiple follow-ups: LEFT to (2,7) expands room, DOWN to (3,6) moves closer to apples (e.g., then LEFT again for zig); RIGHT back to (4,7) if needed. From (3,7), UP forbidden (own body at (3,8)). This keeps high freedom, avoids potential enemy head-on (unlikely soon), and pushes toward 4 apples in estimated 4-6 turns via side paths. Enemy focused low-right, so upper-left is open.\n\n- RIGHT to (5,7): Shifts toward upper-right space/apple (6,9), with escapes (UP/DOWN/RIGHT further). Could compete with or block enemy if they zig up-right late, but stalls direct apple advance, commits to column 5 early, and funnels options (left limited by own body soon). Less optimal for growth; upper-right apple farther and riskier against a longer enemy.\n\nLEFT is best: It executes the prior zig-left strategy, maximizing options/engine room while directly progressing toward reachable apples ((1,5) via zig after DOWN). Closes apple gap safely without over-committing; enemy seems low/baseline, so avoid midline/right crowding. If enemy rushes up midline post-move, I can still pivot RIGHT/DOWN from (3,7). Continue LEFT after if down allows zig (e.g., to (3,6)), aiming for 4 apples soon; monitor enemy for head-on threats and reorient to (6,9)/(9,1) if they die or we collide. Avoid bottom until enemy weakens.\n\nLEFT",

RIGHT branch leads to (9,1) but enemy is closer, and (1,0)/(6,9) are distant.\n  - LEFT advances toward upper-left cluster ((1,5), (0,6)) with good wiggle room, matching last zig-left plan.\n  - UP goes nowhere useful; DOWN offers similar future flexibility but requires an extra move to reach left apples.\n  - Enemy head at (7,1): Likely heading RIGHT toward (9,1) (their 7 apples suggest confidence), so low collision risk.

Follow-up: LEFT (0,8), RIGHT (2,8), UP (1,9). Moves up column 1 but away from closer apples, fewer near-term options toward (1,5) or (0,6).\n  - **DOWN** to (1,6): Safe (empty cell). New body: [(1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7)]. Follow-up: DOWN (1,5 eat apple), LEFT (0,6 eat), RIGHT (2,6). High flexibility, direct path to both close apples in 1 move, open board (no edges or traps), matches zig-left momentum by positioning for left/down eats.\n  - **LEFT** to (0,7): Safe (empty cell). New body: [(0,7), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7)]. Follow-up: UP (0,8), DOWN (0,6 eat). Limits options (no RIGHT due to body at 1,7; LEFT off board), forces commit to column 0, potential edge trap after eating (only UP or RIGHT then).\n  - **RIGHT** rejected: Into own body at (2,7), death.\n\n- **Apple Proximity and Strategy**:\n  - Close apples: (1,5) 2 moves via DOWN then DOWN (simple), (0,6) 2 moves via DOWN then LEFT or LEFT then DOWN (more complex). DOWN better balances progress to both without side-trap risks. Enemy at (8,1) likely moves RIGHT to (9,1), no immediate intersection.\n  - Favor moves opening multiple safe eats: DOWN excels (2 apples, flexible boards), LEFT traps early, UP diverges. Avoids dead-ends (column 0 squeeze) while zigging toward upper-left cluster.\n\n- **Decision**: DOWN maintains zig-left plan, maximizes safe future eats/flexibility over LEFT's early tightness. \n\n**START FUTURE PLAN**  \nFrom (1,6), prioritize (0,6) or (1,5) eat: LEFT to (0,6) for 2nd zig, or DOWN to (1,5) if enemy stays low. Monitor enemy head (likely at 9,1); if they turn up, shift RIGHT from (1,6) for mid-board buffer. Keep eating over engagement.  \nEND FUTURE PLAN  \n\nDOWN",

One is at (1, 0) and (1, 5), and the other is at (6, 9) and (7, 9).\n2. **Pathing:** \n   - Moving DOWN to (9, 0) then LEFT toward (1, 0) is a clear path along the wall. However, my body currently occupies the y=1 row from x=3 to x=9, which might make navigating back from the bottom left slightly restricted for a few turns.\n   - Moving UP toward (9, 9) then LEFT toward (7, 9) and (6, 9) is also very open.\n3. **Enemy Interaction:** Snake #1 is at (1, 6), which is very close to the apples at (0, 6), (1, 5), and (1, 0). It is highly likely Snake #1 will claim the top-left apples quickly.\n4. **Efficiency:** The apples at (6, 9) and (7, 9) are currently uncontested and closer to my current position than the bottom-left apple if I consider the head-to-head race with Snake #1. \n5. **Safety:** Moving to the edge and staying mobile is key. Moving UP avoids potential crowding at the bottom since my body will take several turns to clear the y=1 and x=3 areas.\n\n**Plan:**\nMoving UP is the safest way to begin a rotation toward the top-right apples (6, 9) and (7, 9), keeping distance from the enemy and avoiding trapping myself against my own tail at (3, 3).\n\nUP",

My two safe options are LEFT (to (0,9), heading west away from apples into an empty quadrant with less immediate reward) or RIGHT (to (2,9), advancing east towards those high-value clustered apples at (6,9)/(7,9) for quick 1-2 point gains to close the 5-8 score gap, while keeping y=9 as an open runway east to x=9; no obvious traps, and it matches the \"chain RIGHT along y=9\" plan for efficiency). LEFT offers moderate space mid-board south (e.g., towards (6,7) or (8,8) later via pivots) but is indirect and doesn't seize the nearby apples, potentially letting Snake #0 advance north or right sooner. RIGHT keeps top-row freedom, proximity to apples, and safety from head-ons (Snake #0 would need to leap onto y=9, unlikely this turn from (9,8)).

More importantly, if Snake #1 moves RIGHT this turn to (5, 9), we will be adjacent.\n- **RIGHT**: (8, 9). **INVALID** (Backwards into body).\n\n**Strategic Evaluation:**\n1. **Apple Collection:** The apple at (6, 9) is very close, but Snake #1 is also very close to it. If I move LEFT to (6, 9), I get the apple, but I am directly adjacent to Snake #1's head if they move RIGHT. \n2. **Safety vs. Greed:** Snake #1 (Head: 4, 9) is likely moving for the apple at (6, 9). If I move LEFT (6, 9) and they move RIGHT (5, 9), I will be at (6, 9). On the following turn, if I move LEFT again to (5, 9) and they move RIGHT, we collide. Given my length (11) and the board state, I don't want to risk a head-on collision when I am already leading in score (10 to 5) and the game is early.\n3. **Alternative Path:** By moving LEFT to (6, 9), I take the apple. If Snake #1 moves towards me, I can then pivot DOWN to (6, 8) to avoid a head-on collision and target the apple at (6, 7). \n4. **Current Move:** Moving LEFT to (6, 9) is objectively the best move to gain a point and maintain pressure, provided I am prepared to dive DOWN if Snake #1 challenges the space.\n\n**Plan:**\nMove LEFT to take the apple at (6, 9). Watch Snake #1 closely. If they move to (5, 9), I must move DOWN to (6, 8) on the next turn to avoid a potential head-on collision at (5, 9) and to path toward the apple at (6, 7).\n\nLEFT",

DOWN to (4,8) avoids this immediate collision risk, keeps multiple follow-up options (LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN, etc. from there), and maintains open space to maneuver towards alternative apples like (5,5) without trapping myself in the upper row.

If I move LEFT, I need to make sure I don't get trapped between Snake #1 and my own long tail.\n- Snake #1 might move RIGHT toward (4, 4) (which is their body) or more likely (2, 4), (3, 3), or (3, 5). They are somewhat restricted by their own tail at (5, 4-8).\n- The apple at (7, 6) is currently blocked off by my own body at (6, 6-9) and (9, 6).

Shifts away from enemy likely dropping to bottom left, and opens paths to distant (1,2) or (0,8) without immediate traps. Down or left this turn deviates aimlessly; down to (3,3) funnels toward bottom without targeting an apple soon, and left to (2,4) delays (3,6) reach without clear advantage (could backtrack later).\n\nLP: Post-(3,6) eat, from (3,6), prioritize LEFT-flanking: DOWN to x=0-1 for (1,0)/(1,2)/(0,8) catch-up, bypassing enemy center strength.

No head-on risks, as my end positions don't overlap (e.g., no matching (3,6) with any of theirs).\n\nApples in play: (3,6) is reachable via UP. Other apples: (1,0), (0,8), (7,6), (1,2). I have 6 apples vs. enemy's 14, and I'm shorter (7 segments vs. 15), so acquiring apples is crucial without dying.\n\nPrefer UP to eat (3,6) immediately\u2014it fulfills the last rationale's priority, grows my snake, and positions me at (3,6) for future LEFT-flanking. LEFT or RIGHT keeps me alive but doesn't target the apple soon or align with the strategy to avoid the x=5-9 congestion where the enemy dominates. RIGHT edges closer to enemy paths without clear apple gain. UP leaves multiple follow-ups open (post-eat: DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT from (3,6)).\n\nLP: After eating (3,6) and growing to 8 segments, prioritize DOWN to (2,6)/(2,7) or zigzag left (e.g., LEFT to (2,6) if safe) toward low-x apples like (1,0) or (1,2), while staying clear of enemy bottom advances. If threat from enemy dropping, veer up toward (0,8) or pivot right only if (7,6) opening without head-on. Monitor for sand/boxed-in risks; don't rush high-y if it blocks escape routes. Balance growth vs. space to outlast to 50 apples or until enemy dies.\n\nUP",

LEFT opens space and directs toward low-x apples with multiple escape options (LEFT, DOWN, UP from (2,6)), setting up future DOWN/LEFT zigzags for (1,2)/(1,0). UP offers similar space but doesn't push leftward as aggressively; enemy eating (4,3) next turn underscores avoiding competition there. Favor LEFT for space and apple proximity alignment.\n\nLP: After LEFT to (2,6), prioritize continuing LEFT to (1,6) or LEFT/DOWN zigzags (e.g., LEFT to (1,6), then DOWN to (1,5) if safe) to reach (1,2) or spiral toward (1,0)/(0,8), ensuring low-x paths clear of my old trail and enemy right-side dominance. If enemy encroaches bottom-right, loop up toward (0,8) only after securing an apple; avoid RIGHT altogether to prevent high-risk containment near enemy.

I need to be careful of Snake #1 at (1,6) moving down, but at (2,3) I am still 3 steps away from its head.\n\nPlan:\nMove LEFT to (2, 3) to target apples at (1, 2) and (1, 4).

However, (1, 2) is closer to a cluster of apples (1, 0 and 1, 2).\n\nThe biggest risk is Snake #1 cutting me off. Snake #1's current head is at (1, 4). If I move to (1, 2), I am very close to it. If I move to (3, 2), I get an apple and have more maneuvering room. Let's look at apple (3, 2). It is right next to my current head.\n\nPlan: Move RIGHT to (3, 2) to secure the apple. It is safe, increases my score, and keeps me away from the wall and the enemy for the moment. After (3, 2), I can evaluate moving towards (1, 2) or (1, 0) based on Snake #1's movement.\n\nRIGHT",

Their possible moves are (0, 1), (2, 1), or (1, 0).\n- If I move LEFT to (2, 0) and they move DOWN to (1, 0), they eat the apple and we both survive (adjacent).\n- If I move LEFT to (2, 0) and they move RIGHT to (2, 1), we are adjacent and both survive.\n- Moving RIGHT to (4, 0) is safer in terms of avoiding the enemy, but yields no progress toward the (1, 0) apple.\n- My body at (3, 1) will move to (3, 0) this turn. (2, 0) is clear.\n\nPlan: Move LEFT to (2, 0) to contest the apple at (1, 0). From (2, 0), if it's safe, I will continue LEFT to (1, 0) next turn. If the enemy takes the apple at (1, 0) this turn, I will pivot based on the new board state.\n\nLEFT",

It maintains options: After DOWN, new head at (1,0), body adds (1,0) at head, tail at (3,4) stays (growth). Next safe moves likely LEFT to (0,0) for edge escape or RIGHT to (2,0) but enemy head at (3,0) could go LEFT to (2,0), risking collision if they predict. LEFT or RIGHT from (1,1) forego the apple and don't improve position vs. enemy.\n\nPrioritizing apple eat while keeping options open: No apparent traps; enemy snake blocks much of the center/right but DOWN aligns with short-term plan to eat (1,0) then assess retreat to (0,8) or open areas, avoiding column 1 if enemy advances.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat (1,0), then prioritize LEFT/RIGHT from (1,0) to (0,0)/(2,0) based on enemy moves (lavoids their head path). Aim for (0,8) apple next, keeping >=2 future options; avoid enemy-filled areas; chase other apples like (7,6) if clear path opens.

So only LEFT is safe.\n\nLEFT keeps the path open along the left edge, allowing movement UP the x=0 column to eat (0,8) without trapping me. It avoids immediate risks, avoiding the enemy head (who might also be maneuvering to block or ram). This aligns with the goal of safely eating apples while maintaining multiple future options (e.g., UP next, then more UP, eventually turning right or left at top).\n\nEnemy snake is long and blocks much of the center/right; I should avoid those areas until their position shifts. No head-on risk this move, as enemy can't move into (0,0) this turn.\n\nLong-term plan: Eat (0,8) by going UP from (0,0) as needed, staying in x=0 until y~8+; then assess pivot right/down toward apples like (7,6)/(7,3) or up-right toward (5,9)/(6,9) if enemy clears paths.

This is currently occupied by Snake #1's body.\n4. **RIGHT**: (3, 1). **INVALID**. This is currently occupied by my own body.\n\nWait, looking at the board state and the coordinate sequence:\nMy Body: (2,1) head, (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)...\nLet's re-evalute neighbors of (2,1):\n- (2, 2): Segment index 5.\n- (2, 0): Segment index 1 (Neck).\n- (1, 1): Occupied by Snake #1's body.\n- (3, 1): Segment index 3.\n\nIt appears I have boxed myself in or the body is coiled very tightly. Let's check the tail. The tail is at (6, 7). Every turn the tail moves. \nWait, looking at the coordinates provided for Snake 0:\nHead: (2, 1)\nBody: [(2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7)]\nTotal length including head: 17.\n\nValid moves from (2, 1):\n- (1, 1): Snake 1 Body is there.\n- (3, 1): My Body is there.\n- (2, 2): My Body is there.\n- (2, 0): My Body is there.\n\nHowever, in Snake games, the tail moves forward unless an apple was eaten. I did not eat an apple last turn (Score 16 -> 16).\nThis means (6, 7) will be vacated. But that doesn't help my head at (2, 1). \nWait, is there an error in my adjacency?\nHead at (2, 1).\nLeft: (1, 1) -> Snake 1 has [(1, 0), (1, 1), ...]. (1, 1) is occupied.\nRight: (3, 1) -> My body is at (3, 1).\nDown: (2, 0) -> My body is at (2, 0).\nUp: (2, 2) -> My body is at (2, 2).\n\nWait, Snake #1 Head is at (0, 0). Its body starts at (1, 0). \nIf Snake #1 moves from (0,0) to (0,1), its body moves. (1, 1) is index 2 of its body. It will stay occupied.\nIf I move RIGHT to (3,1), UP to (2,2), or DOWN to (2,0), I hit my own body.\nSince I must move, I will check if any of these segments are the tail. None are.\nHowever, I must select the \"least\" dead option or hope for a coordinate update. \nLooking at the board: (1, 1) is the only cell not part of MY body. It belongs to Snake #1. If Snake #1's tail was at (1, 1), it would vacate. But its tail is at (3, 5).\n\nRe-checking move RIGHT (3,1). It's my body. UP (2,2) is my body.\nIs there any move? I will try RIGHT and hope for the best.\n\nRIGHT",

Only UP is safe.\n\nUP advances along the x=0 column toward the apple at (0,8), maintaining openness along the left edge. No immediate risks: no collision with enemy head (who is at (2,1) and unlikely to head left this turn), no traps, and it positions me to continue UP for easy future moves like eat (0,8) without closing options early. Avoids central areas clogged by enemy body; enemy hasn't shifted to block low y-coordinates yet.\n\nLong-term plan: Stick to x=0, keep moving UP to eat (0,8) around y=8 (approximately 8 more UP moves from here). After eating, assess pivoting right toward reachable low-risk apples like (7,3)/(7,6) if paths open (enemy is long but might move). Avoid right/central until enemy position changes or dies; prioritize safe extension over aggression, aiming to catch up (I'm at 10 apples vs. their 16). If enemy blocks or dies, adapt to chase remaining apples.\n\nUP",
