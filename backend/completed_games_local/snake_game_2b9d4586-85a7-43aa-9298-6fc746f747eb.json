Apples everywhere but we ignore? Nah, we keep an eye on 'em for later growth dominance.\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK:**\n- UP to (8,2): empty, safe.\n- DOWN to (8,0): empty, safe.\n- LEFT to (7,1): empty, safe.\n- RIGHT to (9,1): empty, safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe right now. No walls, no bodies.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy at (7,3). Possible moves: UP (7,4), DOWN (7,2), LEFT (6,3), RIGHT (8,3). All safe for him too. Head-on collision risk? If I go LEFT to (7,1), he goes DOWN to (7,2) \u2014 no collision. If I go UP to (8,2), he goes RIGHT to (8,3) \u2014 no collision. Actually, only way we collide this turn is if I go RIGHT to (9,1) and he goes... nowhere near. So no immediate head-on threat.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:** We need to box him in early. He's above me. I want to get between him and the bottom of the board, cut off his space. Also, I want to stay flexible.\n\nIf I go UP to (8,2), I'm moving closer to him but also toward center. If I go LEFT to (7,1), I'm moving laterally, maybe setting up a vertical wall later. Actually, going LEFT puts me at x=7, same column as him but two rows down. That could pressure him upward.\n\nBut wait \u2014 going DOWN to (8,0) feels too defensive first turn. Going RIGHT to (9,1) pushes me to the edge, reduces options.\n\n**BEST AGGRESSIVE YET SAFE MOVE:** I think LEFT to (7,1). Why? It puts me directly under him (he's at (7,3), I'm at (7,1)). Next turn I can go UP to (7,2) and he might have to avoid me. I'm starting to squeeze his movement. Also, from (7,1) I have UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all open next turn probably.\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:** After moving to (7,1), watch where he goes. If he goes DOWN to (7,2), we'd be adjacent \u2014 dangerous but I have score tie so head-on would kill us both. Avoid that. Instead, maybe go LEFT or RIGHT to flank. Goal: force him toward top or edges.\n\nLEFT it is. Let's pressure early! \ud83d\ude08\n\nLEFT",

We're behind, but early game \u2014 we can catch up!\n\n**IMMEDIATE DANGER CHECK:**\n- UP to (7,2): empty, safe.\n- DOWN to (7,0): empty, safe.\n- LEFT to (6,1): empty, safe.\n- RIGHT to (8,1): empty, safe.\n\nAll four moves are safe right now \u2014 no walls, no bodies.\n\n**ENEMY PREDICTION:** Enemy at (8,3) with body at (7,3). He CANNOT go DOWN into his own body at (7,3). So his possible moves: UP (8,4), LEFT (7,3) \u2014 wait that's his body, no, that's DOWN? Let's list clearly:\nFrom (8,3):\n- UP: (8,4) \u2014 empty.\n- DOWN: (8,2) \u2014 empty.\n- LEFT: (7,3) \u2014 OOPS that's his own body segment! So LEFT is **unsafe** for him.\n- RIGHT: (9,3) \u2014 empty.\n\nSo enemy can only go UP, DOWN, or RIGHT.\n\n**HEAD-ON COLLISION RISK?**  \nIf I go RIGHT to (8,1) and he goes DOWN to (8,2) \u2014 no collision.  \nIf I go UP to (7,2) and he goes DOWN to (8,2) \u2014 no collision.  \nIf I go UP to (7,2) and he goes RIGHT to (9,3) \u2014 no.  \nActually, the only possible head-on this turn is if I go RIGHT to (8,1) and he goes DOWN to (8,2)? That's not head-on, that's adjacent. Head-on requires same cell. So no direct head-on threat this turn.\n\n**LONG-TERM STRATEGY:**  \nWe're behind in apples \u2014 need to grow soon but SAFELY. Enemy is above us. We want to pressure him, maybe force him toward edges.  \nGoing UP to (7,2) puts us closer to him, maybe cut off his DOWN movement next turn.  \nGoing RIGHT to (8,1) moves us under him but to the right \u2014 could flank.  \nGoing LEFT to (6,1) moves away \u2014 maybe too passive.  \nGoing DOWN to (7,0) moves to bottom edge \u2014 reduces options.\n\n**APPLE CONSIDERATION (just a little):**  \nApples at (4,1), (5,1), (2,1) are on row 1 \u2014 we could go LEFT toward them eventually. But immediate apple at (4,1) is far.  \nApple at (4,0) is bottom row.  \nBut enemy has 1 apple already \u2014 we need to catch up, but not recklessly.\n\n**BEST MOVE FOR FUTURE FLEXIBILITY & PRESSURE:**  \nI think UP to (7,2). Why?  \n1. Puts us directly below enemy (he's at (8,3), we're at (7,2)).  \n2. Next turn, if he goes DOWN to (8,2), we could go RIGHT to (8,2) for head-on? But we have lower score \u2014 that would kill us. So we'd avoid that. Instead, we could go LEFT or UP to pressure.  \n3. From (7,2), we keep many options open: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT all likely safe next turn.  \n4. It's aggressive \u2014 we're moving toward the enemy, showing dominance early! \ud83d\ude08\n\n**PLAN FOR NEXT TURN:**  \nAfter moving to (7,2), watch enemy move. If he goes DOWN to (8,2), we must avoid moving into (8,2) because head-on with lower score = death. Instead, maybe go LEFT to (6,2) or UP to (7,3) \u2014 wait (7,3) is his body, that's safe for us (he dies if he hits us, but we don't hit him). Actually, moving into his body is safe for us? No \u2014 moving into ANY snake's body kills us. So (7,3) is his body \u2014 we cannot go there. So from (7,2), safe moves would be UP? No, UP is (7,3) his body \u2014 unsafe. So actually, going UP now to (7,2) will make UP unsafe next turn. That's fine \u2014 we'll have LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN.\n\nLet's commit \u2014 UP to pressure and keep options!\n\nUP",

He's near bottom-left area.

That could set up a potential trap or head-on risk next turn.\n\n**BEST MOVE:** I think DOWN to (6,1)!\nWhy? \ud83d\ude24\n1. Puts us ONE step from two apples at (5,1) and (4,1) \u2014 we can grab one next turn and tie the score!\n2.

Avoids moving into center where we could get boxed later.\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:** From (6,1), assess enemy position. Likely grab (5,1) apple if safe, or (4,1).

He can't stay still. If he goes LEFT to (6,1), then (7,1) is empty and we move in \u2014 safe? Actually simultaneous: if he leaves (7,1) and we enter (7,1), no collision. The danger is if he ALSO tries to enter (7,1) from somewhere else \u2014 impossible since he's already there. The real head-on risk is if we both try to occupy the SAME *new* cell. That's not (7,1). So maybe RIGHT is safe? Let's check: He can't go RIGHT. If he goes LEFT to (6,1), we go RIGHT to (7,1) \u2014 different cells, safe. If he goes UP to (7,2), we go RIGHT to (7,1) \u2014 safe. If he goes DOWN to (7,0), we go RIGHT to (7,1) \u2014 safe. So actually RIGHT might be safe too? WAIT \u2014 but what if he goes LEFT to (6,1) and we go RIGHT to (7,1)? That's fine. So all four might be safe from head-on? Let's double-check same-cell collisions: possible shared destinations? Our possible destinations: (6,2), (6,0), (5,1), (7,1). His possible destinations: (7,2), (7,0), (6,1). No overlap! So no possible head-on collision this turn! That means all four moves are viable.\n\n**BUT \u2014 moving RIGHT to (7,1) is risky long-term:** We'd be adjacent to his possible moves. If he goes LEFT to (6,1), we'd be side-by-side. That could set up a forced collision next turn if we're not careful. Better to avoid that unless we're trying to force a trap.\n\n**APPLE STRATEGY:**\nLEFT to (5,1) grabs an apple immediately \u2014 TIES THE SCORE 1-1! That's huge. Then we have a body segment behind us, making us stronger. From (5,1) next turn, we can go UP (5,2), DOWN (5,0), LEFT (4,1) another apple, RIGHT (6,1) \u2014 but (6,1) might be occupied by enemy if he moves left. So we'd have 3 safe options likely.\n\n**LONG-TERM PLAN:**\nAfter eating apple at (5,1), we want to pressure enemy. He might go for other apples at (4,1) or (4,0). We can try to cut him off. With equal length, head-on collisions are equal death \u2014 but we can use our new body to limit his space. We should aim to control the bottom-left apple cluster and force him into a bad spot.\n\n**BEST MOVE: LEFT to (5,1)!** \ud83d\ude24\nWhy?\n1. Instant apple \u2014 TIE SCORE 1-1!\n2. Grows our snake to length 2 \u2014 more board presence!\n3. Puts us in position to contest (4,1) apple next.\n4. Avoids unnecessary adjacency risk with enemy.\n5. All moves were safe this turn, but this gives us immediate progress.\n\n**NEXT TURN PLAN:** From (5,1) with body at (6,1), assess enemy position. Likely move LEFT to (4,1) to grab another apple and extend lead, or move UP/DOWN to maneuver. Avoid moving RIGHT back into (6,1) unless it's safe and strategic. Pressure enemy by threatening apples and limiting his moves.\n\nLEFT",
