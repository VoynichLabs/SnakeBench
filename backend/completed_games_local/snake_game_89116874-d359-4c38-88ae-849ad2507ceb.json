Analyze Immediate Threats (Turn 0)**\nSince this is Turn 0 and all snakes are length 1, the only immediate death risks are:\n    a) Moving off the board.\n    b) Moving into the head of an opponent (head-to-head collision).\n    c) Moving into my own body (impossible right now as I only have a head).\n\n**Current Safe Moves (from (2, 6)):**\n*   **UP** to (2, 7). Safe (on board, far from Snake 1).\n*   **DOWN** to (2, 5). Safe (on board, far from Snake 1).\n*   **LEFT** to (1, 6). Safe (on board, far from Snake 1).\n*   **RIGHT** to (3, 6). Safe (on board, far from Snake 1).\n\n**2. Analyze Opponent's Location and Likely Moves (Snake #1 at (5, 9))**\nSnake #1 is near the top edge. It has two apples nearby: (4, 9) and (1, 9).\n*   If Snake 1 moves **LEFT** to (4, 9), it hits an apple.\n*   If Snake 1 moves **DOWN** to (5, 8).\n*   If Snake 1 moves **RIGHT** to (6, 9).\n*   Moving **UP** to (5, 10) kills it (off-board).\n\nSnake 1 will most likely move LEFT to capture the strong apple at (4, 9). Snake 1 is not a threat to me for moves this turn regardless of its choice, as we are far apart.\n\n**3. Evaluate Apple Locations and Proximity**\nMy snake is at (2, 6).\n*   Apple (3, 3): Manhattan distance = |3-2| + |3-6| = 1 + 3 = 4 moves.\n*   Apple (0, 1): Manhattan distance = |0-2| + |1-6| = 2 + 5 = 7 moves.\n*   Apple (7, 0): Manhattan distance = |7-2| + |0-6| = 5 + 6 = 11 moves.\n*   Apples (4, 9) and (1, 9) are far and likely contested by Snake 1.\n\nThe closest apple is (3, 3), 4 moves away.\n\n**4. Determine Optimal Move to Approach Apple (3, 3)**\nTo reach (3, 3), I need to move RIGHT (to increase X) and DOWN (to decrease Y).\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (3, 6):** Increases proximity to (3, 3) (distance becomes 3).\n*   **Move DOWN to (2, 5):** Does not change proximity to (3, 3) (distance remains 4) but aligns me for future downward movement.\n*   **Move UP/LEFT:** Increases distance.\n\nMoving RIGHT seems best as it immediately reduces the distance to the target food (3, 3).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (1-3 turns):**\n1. Move RIGHT to (3, 6).\n2. Move DOWN to (3, 5).\n3. Move DOWN to (3, 4).\n4. Move DOWN or RIGHT to (3, 3) or (4, 3) respectively, setting up for the apple at (3, 3).\n\nI will start by moving RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT",

Snake 1 previously moved LEFT from (5, 9) to (4, 9), ate an apple, and grew, leaving its tail at (5, 9). *Wait, the previous board state showed Apple A at (4, 9). Snake 1 must have been at (5, 9) and moved LEFT to (4, 9), consuming the apple.* **Correction**: The previous board state was Turn 0, and my snake moved RIGHT from (2, 6) to (3, 6). Snake 1 was at (5, 9) and subsequently moved.\n\nBased on the provided turn data and history:\n*   My snake (ID 0) started at (2, 6) and moved **RIGHT** to (3, 6) on Turn 0. Length remains 1.\n*   Enemy Snake #1 must have moved **LEFT** from its previous position (likely (5, 9), where its body/tail is now located) to (4, 9), consuming the apple and growing.

(The apple at (4, 9) was consumed by Snake 1).\n\n**Current Positions for Turn 1:**\n*   My Head: (3, 6)\n*   Snake 1 Head: (4, 9)\n*   Snake 1 Body: [(5, 9)] (Tail)\n\n**1.

When a snake moves, its body \"shifts.\" If Snake 1 moves RIGHT to (5, 9), its head lands on the previous tail position, which is still part of the current body until the move is resolved. This is a self-collision.* [docs.battlesnake.com]: \"Self Collisions. If your Battlesnake collides with its own body, it will be eliminated immediately.\" *This move is lethal.*\n*   **LEFT (3, 9):** Safe and moves toward apple (1, 9).\n\nSnake 1 will almost certainly move **LEFT** to (3, 9). This move is safe and directly progresses toward food at (1, 9).\n\n**4. Determine Optimal Move for ID 0:**\nMy goal is the apple at (3, 3). Since my current position is (3, 6), a direct path involves moving DOWN.\n\n*   **Move UP (3, 7):** Increases distance from (3, 3). Avoid.\n*   **Move LEFT (2, 6):** Increases distance from (3, 3). Avoid.\n*   **Move RIGHT (4, 6):** Increases X, keeps Y. Distance to (3, 3) becomes |3-4| + |3-6| = 1 + 3 = 4. Marginal increase in distance, but keeps options open. Towards apple (9, 6).\n*   **Move DOWN (3, 5):** Reduces distance to (3, 3) to 2. *Optimal move for objective.*\n\nMoving DOWN to (3, 5) puts me one step closer to the target apple at (3, 3) with no immediate threats.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (1-3 turns):**\n1. **(Turn 1) Move DOWN to (3, 5).** Distance to (3, 3) is 2.\n2. **(Turn 2) Move DOWN to (3, 4).** Distance to (3, 3) is 1.\n3. **(Turn 3) Move DOWN to (3, 3).** Collect apple.\n4.

This is the direct path.\n\nMoving **DOWN** to (3, 4) is the optimal, safe, and goal-oriented move.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (1-2 turns):**\n1. **(Turn 2) Move DOWN to (3, 4).** Distance to (3, 3) is 1.\n2. **(Turn 3) Move DOWN to (3, 3).** Collect apple. Length increases to 2, head at (3, 3), body/tail at (3, 4).\n3. **(Turn 4) Look for next target.** (0, 1) or (9, 6) seem viable depending on opponent position.\n\nDOWN",

Length 1. Last move was DOWN.\n*   **Enemy Snake #1 (ID 1):** Head at (2, 9). Body: [(3, 9)]. Length 2. Snake 1 previously moved LEFT from (3, 9) to (2, 9), extending its body by leaving its old head position (3, 9) behind, since it ate an apple on Turn 1.\n*   **Apples at:** (7, 0), (0, 1), (1, 9), (3, 3), (9, 6).\n\n**Current Positions for Turn 3 (Start of turn):**\n*   My Head: (3, 4)\n*   Snake 1 Head: (2, 9)\n*   Snake 1 Body: [(3, 9)] (Old head position/first body segment)\n*   Snake 1 Tail: The tail segment that *would* have moved out remains at the pre-apple-eat turn's position. On turn 2, Snake 1 moved LEFT from (3, 9). The tail remains at (4, 9) (from the prior state analysis, which assumed Snake 1 consumed the apple on T1 and was of length 2). Looking at the provided board state: `9 . A 1 T . . . . . .`, '1' is the head at (2, 9) and 'T' is the tail segment currently *visible* at (3, 9). The current board state only shows body/tail segment at (3, 9). This contradicts the length information (Length 2) and the growth mechanic (when eating food, the tail hangs for an extra turn). Since the state description only lists (3, 9) in the body list, I will rely on the provided list: Body: [(3, 9)]. Length 2. Snake 1 segments are (Head: 2, 9), (Tail: 3, 9).\n\nLet's stick to the coordinates provided for Snake 1's body: (2, 9) Head, (3, 9) Tail.\n\n**1. Analyze Immediate Threats for ID 0 (from 3, 4):**\nMy goal is the apple at (3, 3).\n\n*   **Move UP (3, 5):** Safe. Moves away from the apple.\n*   **Move DOWN (3, 3):** Moves onto an apple. Safe from collisions. *Goal Move.*\n*   **Move LEFT (2, 4):** Safe.\n*   **Move RIGHT (4, 4):** Safe.\n\nAll four moves appear immediately safe from stationary elements (my body, enemy body, board boundaries).\n\n**2. Evaluate Head-to-Head Collision Potential:**\nThe enemy Snake 1 is at (2, 9). I am at (3, 4). We are far apart. No head-to-head collision is possible this turn.\n\n**3. Evaluate Apple Location and Proximity:**\n*   **Apple (3, 3):** Distance |3-3| + |3-4| = 1. Moving DOWN captures this apple.\n\n**4. Analyze Opponent (Snake 1 at 2, 9) and Potential Moves:**\nSnake 1 (Length 2, Apple 1) is adjacent to apple (1, 9).\n*   **Apple (1, 9):** Distance |1-2| + |9-9| = 1.\n\nSnake 1's safe moves (from 2, 9, body at 3, 9):\n*   **UP (2, 10):** Die (Off-board, Y=10).\n*   **DOWN (2, 8):** Safe. Moves slightly away from food.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 9):** Die (Into own tail segment).\n*   **LEFT (1, 9):** Captures apple. *Optimal for Snake 1.*\n\nSnake 1 is extremely likely to move **LEFT** to eat the apple at (1, 9).\n\n**5. Determine Optimal Move for ID 0:**\nMy optimal move is to capture the apple at (3, 3). This increases my length to 2 (head at 3, 3; tail/body at 3, 4), and ties the score with Snake 1.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (1-2 turns):**\n1. **(Turn 3) Move DOWN to (3, 3).** Collect apple. Length increases to 2. Score 1.\n2. **(Turn 4) Look for next target.** Snake 1 will be longer and may control the top left. Potential targets are (0, 1) or (7, 0). (0, 1) is 3+2=5 moves away, (7, 0) is 4+3=7 moves away. Move towards (0, 1) seems aggressive, or (7, 0) for space. Since Snake 1 is likely moving to the top left, prioritizing a move away from that region or towards an easily reachable apple is best. After eating the apple at (3, 3), I will move toward (0, 1) if safe.\n\nDOWN",

Moving LEFT to (0, 9) corners it slightly but keeps it on the top wall. Both are viable.\n\n**4. Determine Optimal Move for ID 0 (from 3, 3):**\n\nI need to move toward an apple while keeping space.

Safe.\n*   **Move RIGHT (4, 3):** Moves away from all currently attractive apples. Safe, but suboptimal.\n\nSince Snake 1 is occupying the top 9th row, the best defensive maneuver is to move away from that side of the board and focus on the bottom or left side.\n\nMoving **LEFT** (2, 3): Decreases X, maintains Y. Puts me closer to (0, 1).\nMoving **DOWN** (3, 2): Maintains X, decreases Y. Keeps me central.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 3), I maintain flexibility to move LEFT toward (0, 1) or DOWN in the next turn.

If Snake 1 moves DOWN to (1, 8), it starts descending.\n\nI will choose **LEFT** to increase my chances of reaching (0, 1) safely.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (1-2 turns):**\n1. **(Turn 4) Move LEFT to (2, 3).** Target apple (0, 1).\n2. **(Turn 5) If (0, 1) is still available, continue moving towards it.** Path: LEFT to (1, 3) or (2, 2).

Eliminate LEFT.\n\nSnake 1 is *forced* to move **DOWN** to (0, 8). This is a critical observation, as it confirms Snake 1 will start moving down the left wall.\n\n**4. Determine Optimal Move for ID 0 (from 2, 3):**\n\nI need to continue moving toward (0, 1) while being aware of Snake 1's descent down column X=0.\n\n*   **Move UP (2, 4):** Moves away from (0, 1). Safe, but suboptimal for apple collection.\n*   **Move DOWN (2, 2):** Takes me one step closer to (0, 1) horizontally (1, 2) is a good next move.\n*   **Move LEFT (1, 3):** Direct continuation toward X=0, but Y=3 is far from Y=1, and Snake 1 is moving down X=0.\n\nIf I move **DOWN** to (2, 2):\n1. My body is (3, 3). Snake 1 cannot hit my body.\n2. Next turn, I can move LEFT to (1, 2) or DOWN to (2, 1). Both keep distance from Snake 1 and approach (0, 1).\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (1, 3):\n1. My body is (3, 3).\n2. Next turn, I am at (1, 3). I could move LEFT to (0, 3) and be exactly in Snake 1's path if it continues its descent past (0, 8). This is risky.\n\nSince Snake 1 is guaranteed to move to (0, 8) and continue down column X=0, I should prioritize dropping my Y-coordinate to keep distance from it, yet still target the apple (0, 1) in the bottom corner. Moving DOWN to (2, 2) seems safer and gives flexibility. I can then move LEFT to (1, 2) or DOWN to (2, 1).\n\nSince (0, 1) is 2 moves away horizontally (X=2 to X=0) and 2 moves away vertically (Y=3 to Y=1), moving DOWN now converts Y distance into X-Y relative distance that is more manageable near the corner, especially considering Snake 1 is descending column X=0.\n\nLet's choose DOWN.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (1-2 turns):**\n1. **(Turn 5) Move DOWN to (2, 2).** This avoids moving directly into the path of Snake #1 descending in column X=0.\n2. **(Turn 6, from 2, 2) Move LEFT toward (1, 2) or DOWN toward (2, 1) to approach apple (0, 1).** Check Snake #1's position at (0, 7) or (0, 6) before deciding.\n\nDOWN",

The current board state description for Snake #1: Head (0, 8), Body `[(0, 9), (1, 9)]`. This implies Snake 1 *did not* grow and the body segments are correctly updated: (2, 9) must have been the old tail that was removed.

Since it is already targeting the left-side apples (it has 2 apples and likely wants more), it is highly probable to continue moving DOWN to (0, 7).\n\n*   If Snake 1 moves DOWN to (0, 7), it is 6 squares away from (0, 1).\n*   If Snake 1 moves RIGHT to (1, 8), it moves away from (0, 1).\n\nAssuming Snake 1 is playing aggressively toward the closest common apple (0, 1), it should move DOWN to (0, 7).\n\n**4. Determine Optimal Move for ID 0 (from 2, 2):**\n\nI am currently at (2, 2). Apple (0, 1) is 2 steps LEFT and 1 step DOWN. I need to move quickly but safely to secure this apple before Snake 1 gets too close to the bottom corner.\n\n*   **Move LEFT (1, 2):** Distance to apple (0, 1) becomes 1 left/1 down (2 total moves).\n    *   If I move LEFT to (1, 2), Snake 1 moves DOWN to (0, 7). Safe.\n*   **Move DOWN (2, 1):** Distance to apple (0, 1) becomes 2 left/0 down (2 total moves).\n    *   If I move DOWN to (2, 1), Snake 1 moves DOWN to (0, 7). Safe.\n\nBoth LEFT and DOWN put me 2 moves away from the apple.\n\n*   If I move **LEFT (1, 2)**: Next turn (T7), I can move DOWN to (1, 1), then LEFT to (0, 1) on T8 (or I might die entering (0, 1) if Snake 1 is there early, but Snake 1 is far).\n*   If I move **DOWN (2, 1)**: Next turn (T7), I can move LEFT to (1, 1), then LEFT toward (0, 1) on T8.\n\nMoving LEFT to (1, 2) is slightly better because it puts me immediately closer to the X-coordinate 0, minimizing the chance of Snake 1 blocking the path along X=1 or X=2 later if I'm slow.\n\nLet's re-examine Snake 1's possible head collisions. Since Snake 1 is guaranteed to be at (0, 7) or (1, 8) this turn, and I am moving to (1, 2), (2, 1), or (3, 2), there is no possibility of a head-on collision on Turn 6.\n\nChoosing **LEFT** (1, 2) sets up the best direct approach.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (1-2 turns):**\n1. **(Turn 6) Move LEFT to (1, 2).** Approach (0, 1).

Body is `[(1, 1), (1, 2)]`. Apples collected: 2.\n    *   *Self-Correction from Rationale on Turn 8:* I assumed my move LEFT to (0, 1) to eat the apple at (0, 1) was successful. If it was successful, my body would now be `(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2)`. My current body list given is `[(1, 1), (1, 2)]`, which suggests the list provided is only the *old body segments* and the head movement to (0, 1) successfully ate the apple that was at (0, 1). Let's confirm this by checking the visible Board State, which shows `0` at (0, 1), `T` (Tail) at (1, 1) and (1, 2). The definition says the full body is provided head-to-tail, and the first tuple is the head. The input format provided:\n        *   Your snake (ID: 0): Head: (0, 1), Body: [(1, 1), (1, 2)].\n        *   This means the segments are (0, 1) [Head], (1, 1) [Body segment], (1, 2) [Tail]. This is a length 3 snake.\n        *   The board marking `T` at (1, 1) and (1, 2) confirms the body position.\n    *   *Conclusion:* The move to (0, 1) was successful, securing the apple. My current length is 3.\n\n*   **Enemy Snake #1 (ID 1):** Head at (1, 8). Length 3. Body is `[(1, 7), (0, 7)]`. Apples: 2.\n    *   Snake 1 segments: (1, 8) [Head], (1, 7), (0, 7) [Tail]. The board marking shows `1` at (1, 8) and `T` at (1, 7) and (0, 7).\n\n*   **Apples remaining (5 total):** (7, 0), (9, 6), (7, 9), (4, 9), (8, 2).\n    *   Closest Apples to ID 0 (at 0, 1): (7, 0) [Distance ~7], (8, 2) [Distance ~8].\n    *   Closest Apples to ID 1 (at 1, 8): (7, 9) [Distance ~6], (4, 9) [Distance ~3].\n\n**1. Analyze Immediate Threats for ID 0 (from 0, 1):**\nMy segments: (0, 1) [Head], (1, 1), (1, 2).\n\n*   **Move UP (0, 2):** Safe.\n*   **Move DOWN (0, 0):** Safe.\n*   **Move LEFT (-1, 1):** Die (Off board). Eliminate LEFT.\n*   **Move RIGHT (1, 1):** Die (Into own body segment (1, 1)). Eliminate RIGHT.\n\nSafe moves remaining: UP, DOWN.\n\n**2. Evaluate Available Moves and Apple Proximity:**\n\nWe need to target one of the five apples. Since snake 1 is heading towards the top right, I should focus on the bottom or central areas.\n\n*   **Target (7, 0):** Closest. Requires movement right and down.\n    *   Current location (0, 1).\n    *   If I move **DOWN** to (0, 0): Next turn I can move RIGHT (1, 0).\n    *   If I move **UP** to (0, 2): I move further away from (7, 0).\n\n*   **Target (8, 2):** Second closest.\n    *   If I move **DOWN** to (0, 0): I move slightly further away.\n    *   If I move **UP** to (0, 2): I move slightly closer in Y, but need to move right eventually.\n\nMovement DOWN seems strategically better, pushing me to the bottom edge from where I can move horizontally aggressively towards (7, 0).\n\n**3. Analyze Opponent (Snake 1 at 1, 8):**\n\nSnake 1 is most interested in (4, 9) or (7, 9).\n\nSafe moves for Snake 1 (from 1, 8):\n*   **UP (1, 9):** Safe. Good route toward (4, 9).\n*   **DOWN (1, 7):** Die (Into own body segment (1, 7)). Eliminate DOWN.\n*   **LEFT (0, 8):** Safe.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 8):** Safe.\n\nPredicted movement for Snake 1: UP (1, 9) or LEFT/RIGHT aiming for the upper apples. It is highly unlikely to challenge me for (7, 0) or (8, 2).\n\n**4. Collision Check:**\nSince the opponent is far away (at 1, 8) and my move options (UP / DOWN from 0, 1) are localized in the corner, there is no risk of immediate collision with Snake 1.\n\n**5. Determine Optimal Move for ID 0 (from 0, 1):**\n\nThe move DOWN takes me further away from my body segments (1, 1) and (1, 2) and positions me ideally to sweep the bottom of the board toward the appetizing apple at (7, 0).\n\n*   Choose DOWN. New head at (0, 0).\n\n**Long-Term Plan (1-2 turns):**\n1. **(Turn 9) Move DOWN to (0, 0).** Head at (0, 0).\n2. **(Turn 10, from 0, 0):** Move RIGHT towards the apple at (7, 0). Probably (1, 0) or (0, 1) if repositioning. Since I need to maximize horizontal distance, RIGHT to (1, 0) is preferred.\n3. Observe Snake 1's path; expect them to move towards (4, 9) or (7, 9).\n\nDOWN",

Length 4. Body: `[(4, 9), (3, 9), (2, 9)]`. Apples: 3.\n    *   Last move: Snake 1 likely moved RIGHT from (4, 9) to (5, 9). Since it did not eat, its tail segment (2, 9) was removed. The body is now `[(4, 9), (3, 9)]`. (Wait, the body list length is 3, meaning the total length is 4. If the snake did not eat, the tail should have popped.

Evaluate Safe Moves for ID 0\n\nMy target is the apple at (7, 0).\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (5, 0):** Best move. Advances directly toward (7, 0). This keeps me on the fastest path to the apple (3 steps total: 4,0 -> 5,0 -> 6,0 -> 7,0).\n*   **Move UP to (4, 1):** Moves away from the closest apple (7, 0).

Eating this apple will increase my length to 4 and my score to 3.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (7, 0):** Eat apple, gain 1 score, grow to length 4. (My new tail will vacate (4, 0) and remain at (4, 0) while the head moves to (7, 0)).\n\nAny other move (UP) moves away from the immediate opportunity and does not improve my competitive disadvantage against Snake 1.\n\n## Long-Term Plan (1-2 turns):\n\n1.  **(Turn 16) Move RIGHT to (7, 0).** Eat the apple. New head at (7, 0), length 4, score 3.\n2.  **(Turn 17, from 7, 0):** After eating the apple, the next two closest apples are (8, 2) (distance 3) and (1, 0) (distance 6, but involves reversing direction). The apple at (1, 2) is also a good target. I should likely move UP to (7, 1) to position myself for the center of the board or the apple at (8, 2).\n\nThe immediate move is clear.\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy Prediction and Collision Check\n\nSnake 1 is at (8, 9). Possible moves for Snake 1:\n*   LEFT to (7, 9) (into body segment (7, 9), unlikely if it is following a basic pathfinding)\n*   DOWN to (8, 8)\n*   RIGHT to (9, 9)\n\nSince Snake 1 is long (length 5) and far away, immediate collision risk is zero. My decision focuses purely on maximizing my score and positioning.\n\n## 3. Directional Decision for ID 0\n\nI am currently positioned in the bottom right corner. The next nearest apple is (8, 2), 3 steps away (RIGHT, UP, UP).\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (8, 0):** This keeps me along the bottom edge. While it moves me one step closer to (8, 2), it blocks my movement range slightly if I stay on y=0.\n*   **Move UP to (7, 1):** This moves me into the open board area and provides flexibility.\n    *   From (7, 1), I can choose RIGHT to (8, 1) or UP to (7, 2). Both (8, 1) and (7, 2) lead gracefully towards (8, 2) or (6, 3). Moving UP provides more freedom vertically.\n\nPositioning myself internally rather than hugging the wall often grants better maneuverability. Moving UP to (7, 1) prepares me to access the center apples (8, 2) and (6, 3) effectively.\n\n**Comparison:**\n1. **RIGHT to (8, 0):** Next move UP to (8, 1) or RIGHT to (9, 0) (corner). Puts me in a weak position if Snake 1 decides to come down the right wall later.\n2. **UP to (7, 1):** Next move UP to (7, 2) or RIGHT to (8, 1). This is directly on the path towards both (8, 2) and (6, 3). Moves away from my body line (y=0).\n\nMoving UP seems strategically superior to get off the wall and pursue the centralized targets (8, 2) and (6, 3).\n\n## Long-Term Plan (1-2 turns):\n\n1.  **(Turn 17) Move UP to (7, 1).** Position for internal movement.\n2.  **(Turn 18, from 7, 1):** Move RIGHT to (8, 1) or UP to (7, 2). I will check if Snake 1 is descending, but (8, 2) is a strong target. I will aim for (8, 2) via UP then RIGHT, or RIGHT then UP, depending on what Snake 1 does.\n\nUP",

Enemy Prediction and Collision Check\n\nSnake 1 is at (9, 9). It is long and located far in the upper right corner. Given the apple at (9, 6) and its position, Snake 1 will almost certainly try to move DOWN to (9, 8) or (9, 7) this turn, or potentially LEFT to (8, 9) if it wants to move horizontally.\n\n*   If Snake 1 moves DOWN, it moves on the right edge (x=9). It poses no immediate threat to me at (7, 1).\n*   If Snake 1 moves LEFT to (8, 9), it is still very far away and poses no immediate threat.\n\nNo immediate collision risk with Snake 1.\n\n## 3. Directional Decision for ID 0\n\nI have three safe options: UP, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\n*   **Target 1: (8, 2)**: Nearest apple, 2 steps away.\n    *   Move RIGHT to (8, 1): 1 step closer. Next turn: UP to (8, 2) (Eat).\n    *   Move UP to (7, 2): 1 step closer (via Diagonal distance). Next turn: RIGHT to (8, 2) (Eat).\n\n*   **Target 2: (6, 3)**: Second nearest apple, 3 steps away.\n    *   Move LEFT to (6, 1): 1 step closer. Next turn: UP to (6, 2) (Then UP again to eat).\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT put me on a path to safely eat (8, 2) on the next turn.\n\n**Comparing UP vs. RIGHT:**\n\n1.  **Move RIGHT to (8, 1):** Puts me one step away from the apple (8, 2). This is the most direct approach. My body remains at y=0, and the new body segment will be at (7, 1).\n2.  **Move UP to (7, 2):** Puts me one step away from the apple (8, 2). This also puts me closer to the other center apple (6, 3). It keeps me centralized and further away from conflicts with Snake 1 if it were to come down the right wall, though that is unlikely to be quick enough to matter.\n\nSince both lead to the apple (8, 2) in two turns, I choose the direction that maximizes general board control and flexibility. Moving **UP** positions me to choose between (8, 2) or (6, 3) more easily next turn, and moves me higher into the open board. **Right** forces me toward the right wall.\n\nLet's verify the plan:\n*   T18: UP to (7, 2).\n*   T19: RIGHT to (8, 2) (Eat). Score 4.\n\nThis secures the apple quickly.\n\n---\n## Long-Term Plan (1-2 turns):\n1. (Turn 18) Move UP to (7, 2) to approach apple at (8, 2).\n2. (Turn 19, from 7, 2) Move RIGHT to (8, 2) to eat the apple. Then assess which neighboring apple (1, 2) or (6, 3) to pursue next.\n\nUP",

Safety Check for ID 0 (from 7, 2)\n\nMy intended move from the previous turn's long-term plan was RIGHT to (8, 2) to eat the apple. I must verify safety first.\n\nCurrent head: (7, 2).

Illegal.\n*   **DOWN (9, 7):** Moving directly towards (9, 6). Safe move, highly likely.\n*   **LEFT (8, 8):** Safe move.\n*   **RIGHT (10, 8):** Off board. Illegal.\n\nSnake 1 is highly likely to move DOWN to (9, 7).\n\n**Collision Check at Target (8, 2):**\nIf I move RIGHT to (8, 2), Snake 1 (at 9, 8) cannot reach (8, 2) in one turn. No collision risk.\n\n## 3. Directional Decision for ID 0\n\nThe target apple at **(8, 2)** is immediately reachable with a move to the **RIGHT**. This is the highest priority move as it nets me an apple and increases my lead/catches the enemy lead.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (8, 2):** Eat Apple. Score becomes 4. Body grows to length 5.\n*   Move UP (7, 3): Moves away from immediate apple.\n*   Move LEFT (6, 2): Moves one step closer to (6, 3).\n\nThe unambiguous best move is to capture the apple at (8, 2).\n\n## Long-Term Plan (1-2 turns):\n\n1. (Turn 19) Move RIGHT to (8, 2) and eat the apple. Snake length 5.\n2. (Turn 20, from 8, 2) Once at (8, 2), the next nearest apples are (6, 3) (distance 3, 2 steps away ignoring diagonals) and (1, 2) (distance 7). Move LEFT or UP towards (6, 3). Given (8, 2) is adjacent to (7, 2) (my previous position/current body segment), moving to (7, 2) is a dangerous reversal.\n   *   From (8, 2), moving UP to (8, 3) (distance 2 to (6, 3)) or DOWN (8, 1) (distance 4 to (6, 3)).\n   *   From (8, 2), aiming for (6, 3) would suggest moving UP to (8, 3) then LEFT to (7, 3) then UP/LEFT to (6, 3)/(7, 4) in subsequent steps.\n\nI will plan to move UP next turn if safe, aiming towards (6, 3).\n\nRIGHT",

Enemy Prediction and Collision Check (ID 1 Head: 9, 7)\n\nSnake 1 is at (9, 7). Length 5. Body: `[(9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9)]`.\nSnake 1 is clearly moving down towards the highly valuable apple at (9, 6).\n\nPossible directions for Snake 1 from (9, 7):\n*   **UP (9, 8):** Into own body. Illegal.\n*   **DOWN (9, 6):** **Target location (Apple).** Highly likely move.\n*   **LEFT (8, 7):** Safe, but moves away from immediate apple.\n*   **RIGHT (10, 7):** Off board. Illegal.\n\nSnake 1 is extremely likely to move DOWN to (9, 6) and eat the apple.\n\n**Collision Check:**\n*   My available moves are (8, 3), (8, 1), (9, 2).\n*   Snake 1's key movement is to (9, 6).\n*   None of my safe moves result in a head-on collision or collision with Snake 1's body segments `[(9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9), (7, 9)]` or the expected next tail segment at (7, 9).\n\n## 3. Directional Decision for ID 0\n\nSnake 1 is almost certainly taking the apple at (9, 6). If I move to (9, 3) (closest apple with distance 2), I might be able to capture it before Snake 1 turns back down.\n\nHowever, the apple at **(6, 3)** is also only 3 distance away.\n\nLet's evaluate movements towards the closest apples:\n\n**A. Aiming for (9, 3) (Distance 2, 1 Right, 1 Up):**\n1. Move RIGHT to (9, 2). (Leaves one segment to move UP).\n2. Move UP to (9, 3) next turn (Eat Apple).\n\n**B. Aiming for (6, 3) (Distance 3, 2 Left, 1 Up):**\n*   *Note: LEFT is illegal this turn (7, 2).*\n1. Move UP to (8, 3). (Distance 2 to (6, 3)).\n2. Move LEFT to (7, 3). (Distance 1 to (6, 3)).\n3. Move LEFT to (6, 3) next turn (Eat Apple).\n\n**Comparison:**\nOption A (via RIGHT then UP) is slightly faster and targets an apple closer to the enemy. However, moving RIGHT (9, 2) places me right along the side wall, limiting my movement options. If Snake 1 continues down after eating (9, 6), they will be at (9, 5), (9, 4), and then (9, 3). I need to beat them to (9, 3).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (9, 2), I am in position to grab (9, 3) next turn. If Snake 1 goes straight down, they will be at (9, 5) then (9, 4) then (9, 3) (T+3). I appear to win the race for (9, 3) if I move RIGHT now.\n\nIf I move UP to (8, 3), I start heading towards (6, 3) and remain centrally located, maintaining more flexibility.\n\nGiven the potential for high-density congestion around (9, 3) if Snake 1 moves down the side, and the fact that I just ate an apple and grew to length 5, staying flexible is wise. The apple at (6, 3) is safe and uncontested by Snake 1.\n\nLet's choose **UP** to (8, 3), routing towards (6, 3).\n\n*   Move UP (8, 3): Distance to (6, 3) is 2. Safe.\n*   Move RIGHT (9, 2): Distance to (9, 3) is 1. Risky (side wall, enemy proximity).\n*   Move DOWN (8, 1): Moves away from both targets.\n\nThe safest, flexible choice leading to a new apple is UP.\n\n## Long-Term Plan (1-3 turns):\n\n1. (Turn 20) Move UP to (8, 3). Aiming for (6, 3).\n2. (Turn 21, from 8, 3) Move LEFT to (7, 3).\n3. (Turn 22, from 7, 3) Move LEFT to (6, 3) and eat the apple.\n\nUP",

Safety Check for ID 0 (from 9, 3)\n\nCurrent head: (9, 3). Body segments: (8, 3), (8, 2), (7, 2), (7, 1), (7, 0).\n\n*   **Move UP (9, 4):** Safe. Avoids wall (9, 9) and enemy.\n*   **Move DOWN (9, 2):** Safe.\n*   **Move LEFT (8, 3):** Die (Into own body segment (8, 3), direct reversal). **Eliminate LEFT.**\n    *   *Self-Correction:* Since the snake moves, the segment (8, 3) is replaced by the old tail position (7, 0). My head is protected from its immediate neighbors *unless* attempting an illegal direct reversal or hitting a segment further back. However, entering (8, 3) is blocked because my snake grew and the effective body length is now 6. My next move *cannot* be to (8, 3) because (8, 3) contains my neck/first body segment. **Eliminate LEFT.**\n*   **Move RIGHT (10, 3):** Die (Off board). **Eliminate RIGHT.**\n\nSafe moves remaining: UP, DOWN.\n\n## 2. Enemy Prediction and Collision Check (ID 1 Head: 8, 6)\n\nSnake 1 (length 5) at (8, 6). Body: `[(8, 7), (9, 7), (9, 8), (9, 9)]`. Their tail is at (9, 9) but will move.\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake 1 from (8, 6):\n*   **UP (8, 7):** Die (Into own body segment (8, 7), direct reversal). Illegal.\n*   **DOWN (8, 5):** Safe. Moves toward the center/bottom, potentially preparing for (6, 3).\n*   **LEFT (7, 6):** Safe. Moves toward the left side, possibly aiming for (0, 6).\n*   **RIGHT (9, 6):** **Eats Apple (9, 6)**. This is a very likely move for them.\n\nIf Snake 1 moves RIGHT to **(9, 6)**, they gain an apple and grow to length 6.\n\nMy safe moves: UP (9, 4), DOWN (9, 2).\n\n### Collision Matrix (Snake 0 vs Snake 1):\n\n| My Move (from 9, 3) | S1 Move | S0 Next Pos | S1 Next Pos | Collision Type | Outcome |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| UP | UP (Illegal) | (9, 4) | (8, 7) (N/A) | - | S0 Safe |\n| UP | DOWN | (9, 4) | (8, 5) | - | S0 Safe |\n| UP | LEFT | (9, 4) | (7, 6) | - | S0 Safe |\n| UP | RIGHT (Apple) | (9, 4) | (9, 6) | - | S0 Safe |\n| DOWN | DOWN | (9, 2) | (8, 5) | - | S0 Safe |\n| DOWN | LEFT | (9, 2) | (7, 6) | - | S0 Safe |\n| DOWN | RIGHT (Apple) | (9, 2) | (9, 6) | - | S0 Safe |\n\nNo head-on collision predicted.\n\n## 3. Directional Decision for ID 0\n\nI need to secure the next apple, either (9, 6) or (6, 3).\n\n**Apple (9, 6) Analysis:**\nSnake 1 is positioned at (8, 6) and can reach (9, 6) in 1 move (RIGHT). It is very likely they will take this apple, matching my score of 5. If I move UP to (9, 4), I would be 2 moves away. I cannot reasonably contest this apple.\n\n**Apple (6, 3) Analysis:**\nThis apple is at distance 3 (3 Left).\n*   If I move UP (9, 4), I increase my distance to (6, 3).\n*   If I move DOWN (9, 2), I maintain or slightly increase complexity getting to (6, 3).\n\nThe best route to (6, 3) from (9, 3) is a series of LEFT movements, but LEFT is blocked this turn. The second-best option is generally to move away from the current body mass and open up the movement path.\n\nGiven that I cannot move LEFT:\n*   **Move UP (9, 4):** Positions me for subsequent LEFT moves if the central board clears, though it is further from (6, 3). This also helps avoid the dense lower-right corner.\n*   **Move DOWN (9, 2):** Keeps me low and allows me to curve back towards the left, potentially toward (6, 3) in 2 moves (DOWN, then LEFT to 8, 2 (if safe), then LEFT again). However, this keeps me close to my long body segment (7, 0) and (7, 1).\n\nLet's stick to the high road. Moving UP opens up space vertically and allows for subsequent move towards the quieter left side of the map where (6, 3), (1, 2), (1, 0), and (0, 6) are located.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (1-3 turns):**\n1. (Turn 22) Move UP to (9, 4). Snake 1 likely takes (9, 6). Score 5-5.\n2. (Turn 23, from 9, 4) Move LEFT to (8, 4).\n3. (Turn 24, from 8, 4) Move LEFT to (7, 4).\n4. (Turn 25) Move DOWN to (7, 3) OR LEFT to (6, 4) to grab (6, 3).\n\nMoving UP provides the most flexible movement toward the left half of the board where all remaining apples currently reside, while prioritizing vertical freedom over immediate targeting.\n\nUP",

Since Snake 1 is currently hemmed in, moving LEFT opens up options for Snake 1 and is a highly rational defensive/offensive move for them. I must assume this risk is high. **Mitigation: Avoid UP.**\n\n**If I move LEFT (7, 4):**\nI avoid direct contact with Snake 1's head regardless of where it moves (DOWN (9, 4) or LEFT (8, 5)). Moving LEFT provides maximum safety and continues my progress towards the cluster of apples (6, 3).\n\n## 3. Directional Decision\n\nMoving **LEFT** to (7, 4) is the safest action that also directly advances the objective of reaching (6, 3) quickly.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (1-3 turns):**\n1. (Turn 24) Move LEFT to (7, 4). S1 likely moves LEFT to (8, 5) or DOWN to (9, 4).\n2. (Turn 25, from 7, 4). Move DOWN to (7, 3) or LEFT to (6, 4) to grab (6, 3).

This risk is high as (7, 5) is central and opens up the board for S1. **Mitigation: Avoid UP.**\n\n**If I move DOWN (7, 3):** Safe. This sets up an immediate apple grab at (6, 3) next turn (if S1 doesn't interfere).\n**If I move LEFT (6, 4):** Safe. This sets up an immediate apple grab at (6, 3) next turn (if S1 doesn't interfere).\n\n## 3. Directional Decision - Reaching (6, 3)\n\nThe goal is to reach (6, 3). Both LEFT (to 6, 4) and DOWN (to 7, 3) get me one step closer.\n\nConsider Snake 1's possible moves: (8, 4) or (7, 5). They are highly unlikely to rush towards the target apple (6, 3) yet, as their path is longer (distance 6). Their likely focus will be defensive maneuvering or blocking me.\n\n*   If I move **DOWN (7, 3)**: This puts me adjacent to the apple. Next turn, I move LEFT (6, 3) to eat it.\n*   If I move **LEFT (6, 4)**: This puts me one cell away from the apple, but moving LEFT now requires DOWN (6, 3) next turn to eat it.\n\nBoth are good moves that avoid collision with S1's likely paths. Moving **LEFT** (to 6, 4) seems slightly more aggressive in grabbing territory and keeping my line of retreat (DOWN and UP) open relative to the high density of my body on the right side of the board (near (8,4) and (9,4)). Furthermore, moving DOWN puts me closer to my own tail segment at (8, 2) later, whereas moving LEFT keeps more clear space for the body.\n\nIf I move LEFT (6, 4), my head position is (6, 4). My body does not interfere, and S1 is far away.\n\nThe primary target is (6, 3). Moving LEFT achieves a Manhattan distance of 1 to the apple.\n\nLet's commit to **LEFT** to secure the optimal position for the grab next turn.\n\n## Next Turn Projection (Turn 26)\n\n*   ID 0 moves: LEFT to (6, 4).\n*   S1 likely moves: DOWN to (8, 4) (to lengthen tail/move away from 7, 5 risk) or LEFT to (7, 5) (to block center).\n*   If I am at (6, 4) next turn, I move DOWN to (6, 3) and eat the apple.\n\nLEFT",

Illegal.\n\nSnake 1 has two likely safe moves: UP (7, 6) and LEFT (6, 5).\n\n### Collision Matrix (Snake 0 vs Snake 1):\n\n| My Move (from 6, 4) | S1 Move (from 7, 5) | S0 Next Pos | S1 Next Pos | S0 Safety | S1 Safety | Outcome | Notes |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| DOWN (6, 3) | UP (7, 6) | (6, 3) | (7, 6) | Safe | Safe | S0 eats apple | S1 moves away from target. |\n| DOWN (6, 3) | LEFT (6, 5) | (6, 3) | (6, 5) | Safe | Safe | S0 eats apple | S1 moves adjacent to S0 old spot 7,4. |\n| DOWN (6, 3) | DOWN (7, 4) | (6, 3) | (7, 4) | Safe | Die (S0 body) | S0 eats apple, S1 dies (into S0 neck) | S1 suicidal move. |\n| DOWN (6, 3) | RIGHT (8, 5) | (6, 3) | (8, 5) | Safe | Die (S1 body) | S0 eats apple | S1 suicidal move. |\n| UP (6, 5) | LEFT (6, 5) | (6, 5) | (6, 5) | Die | Die | Head-on collision | **High Risk.** |\n| UP (6, 5) | UP (7, 6) | (6, 5) | (7, 6) | Safe | Safe | S0 moves away from apple, S1 moves away from apple. | |\n| LEFT (5, 4) | UP (7, 6) | (5, 4) | (7, 6) | Safe | Safe | S0 moves away from apple. | |\n| LEFT (5, 4) | LEFT (6, 5) | (5, 4) | (6, 5) | Safe | Safe | S0 moves away from apple. | |\n\n## 3. Directional Decision - Reaching (6, 3)\n\nThe immediate goal is to eat the apple at (6, 3). Moving **DOWN** is the only one that achieves this goal this turn.\n\n1.  **Move DOWN (6, 3):** EAT APPLE. This is safe regardless of S1's move, as S1 cannot reach (6, 3) this turn, and S1's safe moves (UP to 7, 6 or LEFT to 6, 5) are not collisions with (6, 3) or my resulting body. (7, 4) remains my neck, which means S1 moving DOWN to (7, 4) would kill S1.\n\n2.  **Move UP (6, 5):** This risks a head-on collision at (6, 5) if S1 moves LEFT. Given S1 is centered at (7, 5), LEFT is a highly reasonable move for S1 to try to cut into the center space. I must avoid this high-risk conflict when an apple is safely available.\n\n3.  **Move LEFT (5, 4):** This moves away from the apple and allows S1 to move into closer range for future apples.\n\n**Conclusion:** Moving DOWN is the only rational choice. It guarantees an apple and growth, significantly increasing my lead (6 apples vs S1's 5) while being completely safe from S1, even if S1 attempts a risky or suicidal move into my neck/body segments at (7, 4).\n\n## Next Turn Projection (Turn 27)\n\n*   ID 0 moves: DOWN to (6, 3). Eats apple. Length becomes 7. New head: (6, 3), Neck: (6, 4).\n*   S1 likely moves: UP to (7, 6) (safest path) or LEFT to (6, 5) (aggressive centering).\n*   I will be at (6, 3). My body will now be long in the center-right area, controlling some space. The next closest apples are (1, 4), (1, 2), (1, 0), and (0, 6). The next goal is to move leftwards. A good move the turn after eating may be UP to (6, 4) or LEFT to (5, 3).\n\nDOWN",

The tail segment **(8, 3)** will be removed next turn unless I eat another apple.)\n\n*   **Enemy Snake #1 (ID 1):** Head at **(6, 5)**. Length 6 (must have moved LEFT last turn, avoiding collision and my apple). Body: `[(7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5), (9, 6), (8, 6)]`. (S1 did *not* eat, so its tail segment **(8, 6)** is cleared next turn).\n\n*   **Apples remaining (5 total):** (1, 2) (far, left), (1, 0) (far, left), (0, 6) (far, top-left), (1, 4) (far, left), (3, 0) (mid-left/bottom).\n\nMy previous move successfully secured an apple, giving me a 1-point lead. The enemy, Snake #1, moved adjacent to the cluster of my snake's body segments. The current goal is to efficiently move toward the next cluster of accessible apples, which are far to the left.\n\n## 1. Safety Check for ID 0 (from 6, 3)\n\nCurrent head: (6, 3).

Illegal.\n\nSnake 1 has two highly likely safe moves: UP (6, 6) or LEFT (5, 5).\n\n### Collision Matrix (Snake 0 at 6, 3 vs Snake 1 at 6, 5):\n\nThe shortest distance between S0's head (6, 3) and S1's head (6, 5) is 2 units (straight up/down). A head-on collision is impossible this turn. Any move I make will land 1 unit away from my current position. Any move S1 makes will land 1 unit away from its current position. Their paths cannot intersect this turn.\n\n## 3. Directional Decision - Moving Left\n\nThe overall strategy is to move West toward the cluster of apples. (1, 2), (1, 0), (0, 6), and (1, 4) are now the targets.\n\n*   **Move LEFT (5, 3):** This is the best move. It begins the journey West while staying close to the center column (y=3), offering paths up or down later. (5, 3) is a clear path.\n\n*   **Move DOWN (6, 2):** Moves away from the horizontal centerline and deeper into the congested bottom-right area. Less desirable.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (7, 3):** Moves deeper into the congested body mass (8, 3) - (9, 4) instead of breaking out. This is a backward move relative to the goal.\n\nMove LEFT is optimal for positional gain toward the remaining apples.\n\n## Next Turn Projection (Turn 28)\n\n*   ID 0 moves: LEFT to (5, 3). Length remains 7, tail (8, 3) clears. New body is `[(6, 3), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4), (9, 3)]`.\n*   S1 likely moves: UP to (6, 6) or LEFT to (5, 5).\n*   If S1 moves LEFT to (5, 5), its head is now only one cell North/Up of mine (5, 3). This proximity must be managed carefully.\n\nIf S1 moves to (5, 5), S0 needs to respond strategically from (5, 3). Continuing LEFT (4, 3) seems like a good path.\n\nLEFT",

S1 head (5, 5).\n\n1.  **If I move UP (5, 4) and S1 moves DOWN (5, 4):** Head-to-Head collision. Both die. Given S1's desire to move West or get the (0, 6) apple, DOWN (5, 4) is a highly aggressive move for S1, but possible if S1 is trying to block me or set up a trap. However, moving UP (5, 4) puts me in danger without much immediate benefit (the (0, 6) apple is two turns away at best, and S1 can contest it).\n2.  **If I move LEFT (4, 3) and S1 moves LEFT (4, 5):** Both safe. Parallel movement West. This maintains my strategic direction.\n3.  **If I move DOWN (5, 2) and S1 moves UP (5, 6):** Separating vertically. Both safe.\n\n## 3. Directional Decision - Moving Left\n\nThe priority remains moving West to approach the cluster of apples. (1, 2), (1, 0), (1, 4), (3, 0) are great goals.\n\n*   **Move UP (5, 4):** This is dangerous due to the possibility of a direct collision with S1 moving DOWN (5, 4). It is also unnecessary for reaching the nearest apples. **Discard UP.**\n*   **Move DOWN (5, 2):** Safe, but begins moving slightly away from the (1, 4) and (0, 6) apples, although it helps target (1, 2) and (1, 0).

Apples: 5.\n\n## Game State Analysis (Turn 29)\n\nMy snake (ID 0) successfully moved LEFT to (4, 3) on the last turn, consuming 1 apple at (4,3). Wait, let's re-examine the current apple list.\n\nThe current apple list is: (1, 2), (1, 0), (0, 6), (1, 4), (3, 0).\nMy head is at (4, 3). No apple was listed at (4, 3). This means I grew because I *ate* an invisible apple at (5, 3) *before* moving LEFT, or the movement simply occurred and I didn't grow. I have 6 apples now, and my goal is to maintain the lead. My current body length is 7 (Head + 6 segments).\n\n*Self-Correction: The last rationale stated my head was at (5, 3) and I moved LEFT to (4, 3). The new body confirms this movement: the old head (5, 3) is now the neck segment.*\n\n**My Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(4, 3)**\n*   Neck: (5, 3)\n*   Body: `[(5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 4)]`.\n*   Length: 7. Tail segments clears this turn: (9, 4). (If I don't eat).\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(4, 5)**\n*   Neck: (5, 5)\n*   Body: `[(5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5), (9, 5)]`.\n*   Length: 6. Tail segments clears this turn: (9, 5). (If S1 doesn't eat).\n\nWe are now side-by-side, still maintaining the vertical separation of 2 cells. My head is at (4, 3), S1's head is at (4, 5). We are both directly West of our previous highly centralized positions, moving towards the apple concentration on the West side of the board.\n\n**Apples at:** (1, 2), (1, 0), (0, 6), (1, 4), (3, 0).\n\nBoard State:\n 9 . . . . . . . . . .\n 8 . . . . . . . . . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 A . . . . . . . . .\n 5 . . . . 1 T T T T T\n 4 .

Neck: (5, 3).\n\n*   **Move UP (4, 4):** Safe. Moves one step closer to S1 head (4, 5). Target apple (1, 4) is 3 horizontal steps away.\n    *   *Note: (4, 4) is currently clear, but it's adjacent to (5, 4) which was previously part of my body, now cleared.*\n*   **Move DOWN (4, 2):** Safe. Moves toward apple (1, 2).\n*   **Move LEFT (3, 3):** Safe. Hits apple (3, 0)? No, apple is at (3, 0). Moves toward apple (3, 0) (3 steps away), (1, 2), (1, 4).\n*   **Move RIGHT (5, 3):** Die. Into own neck segment (5, 3) (direct reversal). **Eliminate RIGHT.**\n\nSafe moves remaining: UP (4, 4), DOWN (4, 2), LEFT (3, 3).\n\n## 2. Enemy Prediction and Collision Check (ID 1 Head: 4, 5)\n\nSnake 1 (length 6) is at (4, 5). Neck: (5, 5).\nTail clears this turn: (9, 5).\n\nPossible moves for Snake 1 from (4, 5):\n\n*   **UP (4, 6):** Safe. Moves toward apple (0, 6).\n*   **DOWN (4, 4):** Threat: Head-to-Head collision if I move UP (4, 4).\n*   **LEFT (3, 5):** Safe. Continues parallel West movement.\n*   **RIGHT (5, 5):** Die. Into own neck segment (5, 5). Illegal.\n\nS1 safe moves: UP (4, 6), DOWN (4, 4), LEFT (3, 5).\n\n### Collision Analysis\n\nMy head (4, 3). S1 head (4, 5).\n\n1.  **If I move UP (4, 4) and S1 moves DOWN (4, 4):** Head-to-Head collision. Both die. This is the main threat. S1 might move DOWN to contest the center area or trap me against the bottom edge.\n2.  **If I move LEFT (3, 3) and S1 moves LEFT (3, 5):** Both safe. Optimal parallel movement toward apples.\n3.  **If I move DOWN (4, 2) and S1 moves UP (4, 6):** Both safe. Vertical separation increases.\n\n## 3. Directional Decision - Minimizing Risk and Maximizing Gain\n\nThe immediate goal is to reach the Western apple cluster safely.\n\n*   **UP (4, 4):** This move places me squarely in the cell that S1 is most likely to move into if they decide to drop down, either to block me or head towards lower apples. Since I have a lead (6 apples to 5), risking a simultaneous death is not strategic. If S1 moves UP or LEFT, I gain a central position, but the risk of H2H is too high here. **Discard UP.**\n\n*   **DOWN (4, 2):** This is a safe move that sets me up for the apples at (1, 2), (1, 0), and (3, 0). It prioritizes the lower half of the board.\n\n*   **LEFT (3, 3):** This maintains parity with S1 and keeps the most options open. From (3, 3), I can hit (3, 0) by moving DOWN x 3, or UP x 3 to target (0, 6) or (1, 4). It is a direct continuation of my Western strategy and is collision-free unless S1 somehow teleports.\n\nComparing DOWN and LEFT:\nMoving LEFT (3, 3) is strategically sound as it maintains horizontal progress and keeps my options open for both high and low apples. Moving DOWN (4, 2) commits me to the bottom area prematurely. The apple at (3, 0) is immediately reachable from (3, 3) in 3 turns (3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 0) or 4 turns (3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0).\n\nLet's stick with the LEFT movement to avoid vertical risks and continue towards the cluster of apples efficiently. From (3, 3), I am 0 units away from the X coordinate of the (3, 0) apple, and 2 units away from the X coordinate of the (1, 4) and (1, 2) apples.\n\n## Next Turn Plan (Turn 30)\n\nID 0 moves: LEFT to (3, 3).\nFrom (3, 3), the closest apple is approximately (3, 0) (distance 3). The next step should be DOWN to (3, 2) to continue toward the (3, 0) apple, assuming S1 continues to contest the top half of apples (0, 6) and (1, 4).\n\nLEFT",

Vertical separation increases.\n3.  **If I move LEFT (2, 3) and S1 moves LEFT (2, 5):** Both safe. Parallel movement continues.\n\n## 3. Directional Decision\n\nMy priorities: 1. Safety. 2. Apple consumption. 3. Maintain lead.\n\nI need to avoid the shared cell (3, 4).\n\n### Option A: Move DOWN (3, 2)\nPro: Safe. Puts me 2 steps from apple (3, 0) and sets up a clear path for the cluster (1, 2) and (1, 0). This is a strong commitment to the bottom half of the board.\nCon: I concede potential access to apples (0, 6) and (1, 4) to S1.\n\n### Option B: Move LEFT (2, 3)\nPro: Safe, regardless of S1's move (unless S1 moves aggressively RIGHT into my body, which is unlikely as it's reversing its neck, but technically possible if S1 were longer/had clearer options). A safer move is to assume S1's primary goal is UP/LEFT. Moving LEFT gets me closer to the dense cluster at x=1.\nCon: It doesn't put me on an immediate path to any specific apple. It maximizes flexibility.\n\n### Synthesis\n\nThe apple at (3, 0) is only 3 vertical steps away from my current position (3, 3).\nIf I move **DOWN** to (3, 2):\nNext turn: (3, 1).\nTurn after: (3, 0) (EAT!).\nThis provides a guaranteed apple in 2 turns. S1 must react aggressively to stop this, which would likely mean moving DOWN or LEFT, but their primary targets (0, 6) and (1, 4) are North/West.\n\nIf I move **LEFT** to (2, 3):\nTo get to (1, 4), I need 1 LEFT, 1 UP, 1 LEFT, 1 UP... (1, 4) is 1 LEFT, 1 UP/DOWN, 1 LEFT away. This is slower and less direct than the (3, 0) apple.\n\nGiven the immediate guarantee of the (3, 0) apple, and the safety of the DOWN move (avoiding the (3, 4) collision point), **DOWN** is the optimal choice.\n\n## Next Turn Plan (Turn 31)\n\nID 0 moves: DOWN to (3, 2).\nS1 is likely to move UP to (3, 6) or LEFT to (2, 5).\nFrom (3, 2), the next move should be DOWN to (3, 1) to continue toward (3, 0).\n\nDOWN",

Tail segment (7, 5) clears this turn if S1 doesn't eat.\n\n**Apples at:** (1, 2), (1, 0), (0, 6), (1, 4), (3, 0).\n\nMy last move, DOWN from (3, 3) to (3, 2), successfully set me up for the apple at (3, 0). Snake #1 moved LEFT from (3, 5) to (2, 5), claiming the column I previously avoided (x=3) as their potential path.\n\nThe immediate goal is to acquire apple (3, 0).\n\n## 1. Safety Check for ID 0 (from 3, 2)\n\nHead: (3, 2). Neck: (3, 3).\nPotential obstacles: My body: `(3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (6, 4), (7, 4)`. Enemy body: `(3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5)`.\n\n*   **Move UP (3, 3):** Die. Into own neck segment (3, 3) (direct reversal). **Eliminate UP.**\n*   **Move DOWN (3, 1):** Safe. One step closer to apple (3, 0).\n*   **Move LEFT (2, 2):** Safe. Moves diagonally towards apple (1, 2) and opens path flexibility.\n*   **Move RIGHT (4, 2):** Safe.\n\nSafe moves remaining: DOWN (3, 1), LEFT (2, 2), RIGHT (4, 2).\n\n## 2. Enemy Prediction and Collision Check (ID 1 Head: 2, 5)\n\nSnake 1 (length 6) is at (2, 5). Neck: (3, 5).\nTail clears this turn: (7, 5).\nPotential S1 obstacles: Own body: `(3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (6, 5), (7, 5)`.\n\nPossible moves for Snake 1 from (2, 5):\n\n*   **UP (2, 6):** Safe. Strong move toward apple (0, 6) or (1, 4).\n*   **DOWN (2, 4):** Safe. Keeps S1 between me and the central x=1 cluster.\n*   **LEFT (1, 5):** Safe.

S1 head (2, 5). My target is the bottom half, S1's target is the top half. Distance is 3 cells. No immediate head-to-head collision possible this turn.\n\n## 3. Directional Decision - Prioritizing Apple (3, 0)\n\nThe plan from Turn 30 was to move **DOWN** to (3, 1) and then to (3, 0) to eat. This plan remains highly efficient and safe.\n\n*   **Move DOWN (3, 1):**\n    *   Pro: Puts me one step from apple (3, 0). Guaranteed apple next turn if no other snake intervenes. Very safe.\n    *   Con: Commits me to the bottom row, potentially making the (1, 2) and (1, 0) apples more challenging to reach if S1 moves down aggressively on x=2.\n\n*   **Move LEFT (2, 2):**\n    *   Pro: Moves toward the x=1 apple cluster.\n    *   Con: (3, 0) is closer to eat. Moving LEFT means I take two turns to reach (1, 2) instead of getting two apples (3, 0) in two turns. Less efficient.\n\nThe most direct and competitive move is to stick to the plan: go for the quickest possible apple capture at (3, 0).\n\n**Decision: DOWN** to (3, 1).\n\n## Next Turn Plan (Turn 32)\nID 0 moves: DOWN to (3, 0) to eat the apple.\nS1 is likely to move UP to (2, 6) or LEFT to (1, 5) to claim the North/West apples.\n\nDOWN",

Directional Decision - Prioritizing Apple Capture\n\nThe move DOWN to (3, 0) is the most critical and highest-priority action. It secures an apple immediately, increasing my lead (currently 6 vs 5).\n\n*   **Move DOWN (3, 0):** Secures the apple. Guaranteed growth of 1.\n\nWe must also consider S1's likely move. Snake 1 has two immediate apple options: (1, 4) and (0, 6).\nIf S1 moves DOWN to **(1, 4)**, they will also gain an apple. If S1 moves UP to (1, 6), they will position themselves closer to (0, 6). Moving DOWN to (1, 4) is the most effective move for S1.\n\nIf both of us eat this turn, the score will be 7 to 6.\n\n## 4. Next Turn Plan (Turn 33)\n\nAfter eating at (3, 0), my head will be (3, 0). My new tail (3, 2) will remain.\nThe remaining apples are: (1, 2), (1, 0), (0, 6), (1, 4)- (if S1 misses it).\n\nAssuming S1 takes (1, 4), the available apples near me are (1, 2) and (1, 0).\nFrom (3, 0), moving LEFT to (2, 0) and then DOWN or UP towards x=1 seems best. Since (1, 0) is at the bottom, moving towards (1, 0) is spatially tight but secures another apple quickly.\n\nIf S1 eats at (1, 4), they will likely consolidate assets at (0, 6) or try to circle toward (1, 2) or (1, 0).\nMy priority for Turn 33 will be to move towards (1, 0) or (1, 2).\n\n**Decision:** Commit to the apple capture.\n\nDOWN",

My body starts at (3, 1). No threat.\n\n## 3. Directional Decision - Prioritizing Apple Capture\n\nI must move RIGHT or LEFT.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (4, 0):** Moves away from all nearby apples (1, 0) and (1, 2). This is a safe spacing move, but not optimal for scoring.\n*   **Move LEFT (2, 0):** Moves directly toward a cluster of apples: (1, 0) and (1, 2). The next move from (2, 0) can be LEFT to (1, 0) to eat an apple, or UP to (2, 1) to approach (1, 2). This is the best offensive move.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 0), the apple at (1, 0) is one move away.\n\nLet's assume S1 makes the obvious scoring move: **LEFT (0, 4)** (eats apple). Score becomes 8 to 7.\n\nMy current best path leads to (1, 0).\n\n**Path to (1, 0):**\nT33: LEFT (2, 0)\nT34: LEFT (1, 0) (EAT)\n\nThis is a two-move sequence to secure the next apple. I should execute the first step.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T34):**\nIf I move LEFT to (2, 0) this turn, the next move should be LEFT to (1, 0) to capture the apple, assuming S1 doesn't somehow interfere (which seems unlikely given S1's current position and direction of travel).\n\nLEFT",

Illegal.\n\nS1 safe moves: UP (0, 5), DOWN (0, 3).\nS1's move *must* be UP to score immediately and keep pace.\n\n### Collision Analysis\n\nMy optimal move is LEFT to (1, 0) (EAT).\nS1's optimal move is UP to (0, 5) (EAT).\n\n1.  **Head-to-Head Collision:** My target (1, 0) vs S1 targets (0, 5), (0, 3). No collision risk.\n2.  **My Head to Enemy Body Collision:** My head moves to (1, 0). S1's body is at y=4 or y=5, except for the neck (1, 4). No risk to (1, 0). If I move UP to (2, 1), no risk.\n3.  **Enemy Head to My Body Collision:** S1 moves to (0, 5) or (0, 3). My body starts far away at (3, 0). No risk.\n\nSince both our most advantageous moves lead to separate, safe apple captures, executing my primary objective is paramount.\n\n## 3. Directional Decision - Prioritizing Apple Capture\n\nI have two safe moves: UP (2, 1), LEFT (1, 0).\n\n*   **Move UP (2, 1):** This moves towards the apple at (1, 2). It will take two turns to reach (1, 2) (e.g., T35: (1, 1), T36: (1, 2) EAT). I temporarily leave the apple at (1, 0) unsecured.\n*   **Move LEFT (1, 0):** **EATS APPLE (1, 0).** Score advantage gained this turn (or draw if S1 scores). My overall score increases to 8. This is the simplest and most immediate scoring opportunity.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (1, 0), my next safe option would be UP to (1, 1) to approach (1, 2).\n\nI choose to maximize immediate scoring.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T35):**\nAfter eating the apple at (1, 0), move UP towards the apple at (1, 2). S1 is currently focusing on the vertical strip at x=0. S1 will likely move UP to (0, 5) and then (0, 6).\n\nLEFT",

My path is clear: (1, 0) $\\to$ (1, 1) $\\to$ (1, 2) (EAT). This is the shortest path to an apple.\n*   **Move LEFT (0, 0):** This moves me away from the closest apple.\n\nI choose UP to reposition for the next guaranteed score.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T36):**\nMove UP to (1, 2) to eat the apple. This will place my head near the vertical wall. S1 will be busy moving UP the x=0 axis toward potentially the high apples (2, 9), (3, 9). I will secure the (1, 2) apple and then look to traverse rightwards or upwards along the wall.\n\nUP",

This is a critical move to keep pace. Since the next apple for S1 is likely (0, 8), and my path to (1, 2) is entirely clear, this is the optimal move.\n\n**Long-Term Plan (T37+):**\nAfter eating the apple at (1, 2), my head will be at (1, 2). My neck will be at (1, 1), and my tail will be at (5, 3). S1 will likely continue up to (0, 7) or (0, 8). I will then aim for the high apples at (2, 9) and (3, 9).

(0,0) bottom left to (9,9) top right.\n\n**My Snake (ID 0):**\n*   Head: **(1, 2)**. Neck: (1, 1).\n*   Body: `[(1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3)]`.\n*   Length: 10 segments (I successfully ate the apple at (1, 2) last turn, growing the snake. The tail (5, 3) did *not* pop off).\n*   Scores: 9 apples.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 (ID 1):**\n*   Head: **(0, 7)**. Neck: (0, 6).\n*   Body: `[(0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5)]`.\n*   Length: 10 segments (S1 likely moved UP to (0, 7) but did not eat, meaning its tail (5, 5) popped off).\n*   Scores: 9 apples.\n\n**Apples at:** (5, 6), (3, 9), (2, 9), (0, 8), (6, 0).\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1.  Scores are tied 9-9.\n2.  I am positioned at (1, 2), just below a cluster of apples in the top rows, with the closest two being (2, 9) and (3, 9).\n3.  The closest apple to S1 is (0, 8), one step up from its head (0, 7).\n\n## 1. Safety Check for ID 0 (from 1, 2)\n\nHead: (1, 2). Neck: (1, 1).\n\n*   **Move UP (1, 3):** Safe. (1, 3) is currently occupied by the body segment (3, 3), but my body list shows `(3, 3)`. The board state shows `(T)` at (1, 3) is inaccurate based on my explicit body list `[(1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3)]`. Let's rely on the explicit body list. **(1, 3)** is clear in my body list and the board visualization shows `.` at (1, 3). Safe.\n*   **Move DOWN (1, 1):** Die. Into own neck. **Eliminate DOWN.**\n*   **Move LEFT (0, 2):** Safe. Clear cell.\n*   **Move RIGHT (2, 2):** Safe. Clear cell.\n\nSafe moves remaining: UP (1, 3), LEFT (0, 2), RIGHT (2, 2).\n\n## 2. Enemy Prediction (ID 1 Head: 0, 7)\n\nS1 is at (0, 7). Neck is (0, 6). Closest apple is (0, 8) (1 step away).\n\nPossible moves for Snake 1 from (0, 7):\n\n*   **UP (0, 8):** **EATS APPLE (0, 8).** Most rational move.\n*   **DOWN (0, 6):** Die. Into own neck segment. Illegal.\n*   **LEFT (-1, 7):** Die. Off board. Illegal.\n*   **RIGHT (1, 7):** Safe. Clear cell.\n\n**Prediction:** S1 will move **UP** to (0, 8) and eat the apple. Score will become 10-9 in favor of S1.\n\n### Collision Analysis\n\n*   **If I move UP (1, 3):** (1, 3) is clear of S1's predicted move (0, 8). No collision risk.\n*   **If I move LEFT (0, 2):** (0, 2) is open. No collision risk with S1 head at (0, 8).\n*   **If I move RIGHT (2, 2):** (2, 2) is open. No collision risk.\n\n## 3. Directional Decision - Controlling the Board\n\nS1 is likely to take the apple at (0, 8). My current goal is to efficiently position myself for the next available apples: (2, 9) or (3, 9).\n\nFrom (1, 2):\n*   **UP (1, 3):** Best move for high-board access. Pushes me up towards the main apple cluster.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 2):** Also leads toward the center-top, giving more lateral freedom than (1, 3) but keeps me lower.\n*   **LEFT (0, 2):** Traps me in the corner, undesirable.\n\nMoving **UP** to (1, 3) puts me in a strong position to move further toward the top of the board to hunt the remaining three nearby apples: (2, 9), (3, 9), and (5, 6). This commits to the left side of the upper-board area but gives significant vertical progress.\n\nNext turn (T38), options will be UP (1, 4) or RIGHT (2, 3). If I move UP, I can then angle right toward (2, 9) or (3, 9).\n\nLet's check for proximity to S1's tail movement.\nS1 Head moves from (0, 7) to (0, 8) (EAT). S1 Body is stationary.\nMy move UP to (1, 3) is nowhere near S1's body. Safe.\n\nI choose UP to gain valuable vertical ground toward the largest cluster of remaining apples.\n\n## Long-Term Plan (T38+)\n\nS1 is expected to take (0, 8). I will continue moving roughly upwards (currently at (1, 3)) to position myself to intercept the apples at (2, 9) and (3, 9). I must watch S1's movement to prevent them from diving into my current path.\n\nUP",

Neck: (0, 7).\n*   Body: `[(0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5)]`.\n*   Length: 11 segments (S1 ate the apple at (0, 8) last turn, growing its snake. Score is 10).\n*   Scores: 10 apples.\n\n**Apples at:** (5, 6), (3, 9), (2, 9), (6, 0), (8, 2).\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. S1 took the last apple and is now leading 10-9.\n2. S1 is positioned directly below the top edge of the board at (0, 8).\n3. I am at (1, 3), having successfully moved up towards the apple cluster: (2, 9), (3, 9), (5, 6).\n4. S1's long body runs vertically up the x=0 column from (0, 8) down to (0, 5), then corners right to (5, 5).\n\n## 1. Safety Check for ID 0 (from 1, 3)\n\nHead: (1, 3). Current neck is (1, 2).\nMy body path (excluding head and neck): `(1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 3)`. My tail popped off (5, 3).\n\n*   **Move UP (1, 4):** This cell is currently occupied by S1 body segment (1, 4). My body list correctly shows S1 body at (1, 4). **Die.** Into S1 body. **Eliminate UP.**\n*   **Move DOWN (1, 2):** Die. Into own neck. **Eliminate DOWN.**\n*   **Move LEFT (0, 3):** Safe.

Enemy Prediction (ID 1 Head: 0, 8)\n\nS1 is at (0, 8). Neck is (0, 7). S1 is very boxed in by the top edge and its own body running down x=0.\n\nPossible moves for Snake 1 from (0, 8):\n\n*   **UP (0, 9):** Safe. Clear cell. Best spatial orientation and maintains cornering ability.\n*   **DOWN (0, 7):** Die. Into own neck segment. Illegal.\n*   **LEFT (-1, 8):** Die. Off board. Illegal.\n*   **RIGHT (1, 8):** Safe. Clear cell.\n\n**Prediction:** S1 will move **UP** to (0, 9). This is the best move to prevent S1 from getting trapped immediately by its growing length, or preparing to move towards neighboring apples (3, 9) and (2, 9).\n\n### Collision Analysis\n\n*   **If I move LEFT (0, 3):** (0, 3) is clear. S1 at (0, 9) is safe. No collision risk.\n*   **If I move RIGHT (2, 3):** (2, 3) is clear. S1 at (0, 9) is safe. No collision risk.\n\n## 3. Directional Decision - Reaching Apples\n\nMy immediate goal is to gain points to catch up to S1 (10-9). The closest apples are (2, 9) and (3, 9).\n\nFrom (1, 3):\n\n*   **Move LEFT (0, 3):** This maintains vertical alignment but moves me further away from the (2, 9) and (3, 9) apples, and closer to S1's body segments along x=0. S1's head is already at x=0, so moving to (0, 3) is dangerous in the long run as I might get trapped by S1's body length.\n    *   *Path to (2, 9) via Left:* (0, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> ... - longer path.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT (2, 3):** This pushes me inland, giving me more options for upward movement (2, 4 if clear) and aligning for a shot at (2, 9) or (3, 9).\n    *   *Path from (2, 3) to (2, 9):* 6 steps up.\n    *   *Path from (2, 3) to (3, 9):* 1 step right, 6 steps up.\n\nMoving **RIGHT (2, 3)** is essential to avoid potential strangulation by S1's large body on the left side of the board and provides the straightest diagonal approach to the nearest apples.\n\n**Next Turn Plan (T39):** From (2, 3), aim for (2, 4) or (3, 3) to make progress toward (2, 9) or (3, 9). We must anticipate S1 moving right or staying up high. S1's head at (0, 9) is now a threat to (2, 9) and (3, 9). I need to race.\n\nI choose RIGH to position myself centrally and safely for the upward push.\n\nRIGHT",

Neck: (1, 3).\n* Body: `[(1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]`. Length: 10 segments.\n* Score: 9 apples.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 (ID 1):**\n* Head: **(1, 8)**. Neck: (0, 8).\n* Body: `[(0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5)]`. Length: 11 segments.\n* Score: 10 apples.\n\n**Apples (Closest first):**\n1. (2, 9) - Upper-left corner.\n2. (3, 9) - Top edge, near (2, 9).\n3. (5, 6) - Mid-right board.\n4. (8, 2) - Bottom-right quadrant.\n5. (6, 0) - Bottom edge.\n\nSnake 1 is positioned strongly to consume (2, 9) or (3, 9). I must contest this or go for the central apple (5, 6) or the bottom apples. Given the turn constraint (T39) and the score deficit (10 vs 9), getting points quickly is important.\n\n## 1. Safety Check for ID 0 (from 2, 3)\n\nHead: (2, 3). Neck: (1, 3).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Outcome | Notes (Board Reference: Walls/Obstacles are `#`, My Body `0/T`, Enemy Body `1/T`, Apples `A`) |\n|------|---------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **UP** | (2, 4) | Safe | Clear cell. |\n| **DOWN** | (2, 2) | Safe | Clear cell. |\n| **LEFT** | (1, 3) | Die | Into own neck (1, 3). |\n| **RIGHT**| (3, 3) | Die | Occupied by own body (3, 3). |\n\nSafe moves remaining: UP (2, 4), DOWN (2, 2).\n\n## 2. Enemy Prediction (ID 1 Head: 1, 8)\n\nS1 is at (1, 8). Neck is (0, 8). S1's long body runs along x=0 and y=4/5. S1 is centrally positioned to attack the (2, 9) and (3, 9) apples.\n\nPossible moves for Snake 1 from (1, 8):\n\n*   **UP (1, 9):** Safe. Clear cell. This is the direct path to score (3, 9) or (2, 9) next turn.\n*   **DOWN (1, 7):** Safe. Clear cell. Retreat/reposition.\n*   **LEFT (0, 8):** Die. Into own neck. Illegal.\n*   **RIGHT (2, 8):** Safe. Clear cell. Preparing for (3, 9) directly.\n\n**Prediction:** S1 is most likely aiming for the apples (2, 9) or (3, 9) and will move **UP (1, 9)** or **RIGHT (2, 8)**. Moving UP (1, 9) looks slightly better positioned.\n\n*   *If S1 moves UP (1, 9):* S1 is threatening (2, 9) and (3, 9).\n*   *If S1 moves RIGHT (2, 8):* S1 is directly threatening (2, 9) on the next move (if S1 turns UP).\n\n## 3. Directional Decision - Reaching Apples\n\nI am at (2, 3).\n\n*   **Move DOWN (2, 2):** This moves me away from the contested top apples and towards the bottom apple (6, 0) or the mid-right apple (5, 6). This is a defensive/repositioning move.\n*   **Move UP (2, 4):** This is the direct path toward the contested top apples.\n\n**Contesting the Top Apples (2, 9) and (3, 9):**\nIf I move UP to (2, 4), I need 5 more UP moves to reach (2, 9), or 1 RIGHT and 5 UP to reach (3, 9).\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (1, 9), S1 is 1 move away from (2, 9) (RIGHT) or 2 moves away from (3, 9) (RIGHT, RIGHT).\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (2, 8), S1 is 1 move away from (2, 9) (UP) or 2 moves away from (3, 9) (RIGHT, UP).\n\nIn either case, S1 is only 1-2 moves away from scoring the top apples, while I am 5-6 moves away. I cannot win the race for the top ones.\n\n**Targeting (5, 6):**\nFrom (2, 3):\nTo (5, 6) requires moving RIGHT, RIGHT, UP, UP, UP. (5 moves).\n\n**Targeting (6, 0):**\nFrom (2, 3):\nTo (6, 0) requires moving DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT (7 moves).\n\nThe (5, 6) apple offers the best immediate opportunity. Moving UP now (2, 4) keeps options open for contesting the center post-S1 move, or transitioning to the (5, 6) apple.\n\nIf I move UP (2, 4):\nNext turn I can move RIGHT to (3, 4) (safe from S1 body at (4, 5) if I go for (5, 6)).\nIf S1 moves at the top, the central column remains safe.\n\nLet's maintain pressure towards the middle/top of the board, allowing me to pivot easily towards (5, 6) or (3, 9)/(2, 9) if S1 misses or gets blocked.\n\n**Move UP (2, 4)**: This advances me toward the center-top while pivoting slightly away from S1's bulk along x=0/1.\n\n## 4. Final Collision Check (Head-on)\n\nMy possible next head locations: (2, 4) or (2, 2).\nS1 possible next head locations: (1, 9), (1, 7), (2, 8).\n\nThere are no head collision risks as no paths intersect.\n\nMy move is UP to gain altitude and maintain flexibility.\n\n**Plan for T40:** Assess S1's actual move. If safe, pivot right towards (5, 6) or continue upward if S1 left a gap.\n\nUP",

Neck: (2, 4).\n* Body: `[(2, 4), (2, 3), (1, 3), (1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (3, 1)]`. Length: 10 segments.\n* Score: 9 apples.\n\n**Enemy Snake #1 (ID 1):**\n* Head: **(2, 7)**. Neck: (2, 8).\n* Body: `[(2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 5)]`. Length: 11 segments.\n* Score: 10 apples.\n\n**Apples (Closest first):**\n1. (5, 6) - 1 RIGHT, 2 UP (3 moves if clear path).\n2. (3, 9) - Near S1.\n3. (2, 9) - Near S1.\n4. (8, 2) - Far right.\n5. (6, 0) - Bottom edge.\n\nSnake 1 has moved DOWN from (2, 8) to (2, 7). This move suggests S1 abandoned the apples at (2, 9) and (3, 9) for the moment, possibly waiting for my move, or is seeking conflict/trap setup. The apple (5, 6) is now the most critical target.\n\n## 1. Safety Check for ID 0 (from 3, 4)\n\nHead: (3, 4). Neck: (2, 4).\nEnemy body parts nearby: (1, 4), (2, 5).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Outcome | Notes (Board Reference) |\n|------|---------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **UP** | (3, 5) | Safe | Clear cell. Leads toward (5, 6). |\n| **DOWN**| (3, 3) | Safe | Clear cell. |\n| **LEFT** | (2, 4) | Die | Into own neck (2, 4). |\n| **RIGHT**| (4, 4) | Safe | Clear cell. Leads toward (5, 6). |\n\nI have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\n## 2. Enemy Prediction (ID 1 Head: 2, 7)\n\nS1 is at (2, 7). Neck is (2, 8). S1 body occupies (2, 5).\n\nPossible moves for Snake 1 from (2, 7):\n*   **UP (2, 8):** Into own neck. **Die.**\n*   **DOWN (2, 6):** Safe. Moves away from apples.\n*   **LEFT (1, 7):** Safe. Moves toward the corner.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 7):** Safe. Moves toward the board center.\n\nS1 is now positioned ambiguously. If S1 moves RIGHT to (3, 7), it starts moving away from the corner. If S1 moves DOWN to (2, 6), it begins moving towards the center/bottom, potentially intersecting my path to (5, 6).\n\nIf S1 continues maneuvering in the current corner, it complicates my access to the high apples, but the immediate target is (5, 6).\n\n## 3. Directional Decision - Reaching Apple (5, 6)\n\nThe current distance to (5, 6) from my head (3, 4) is (5-3) + (6-4) = 2 + 2 = 4 moves.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (4, 4):**\n    *   Distance reduction: (5-4) + (6-4) = 1 + 2 = 3 moves to (5, 6).\n    *   Next move options: UP to (4, 5) seems safe.\n    *   Optimal path: R, U, U, R. (R to 4,4, U to 4,5, U to 4,6, R to 5,6 - 4 moves total.) Wait, (5, 6) is the apple. R, R (5, 4), U, U (5, 6). R to (4, 4), R to (5, 4), U to (5, 5), U to (5, 6). 3 moves. (4, 4) -> (5, 4) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 6). 3 moves.\n    *   This is the most direct path.\n\n*   **Move UP to (3, 5):**\n    *   Distance reduction: (5-3) + (6-5) = 2 + 1 = 3 moves to (5, 6).\n    *   Optimal path: U to (3, 5), R to (4, 5), R to (5, 5), U to (5, 6). 3 moves.\n    *   This path cuts me closer to S1's body segments if S1 moves unpredictably or if S1 decides to move to (3, 7) and then DOWN.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (3, 3):**\n    *   Increases distance to (5, 6). Avoid.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT lead to (5, 6) in 3 total moves.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (4, 4)**, I maintain separation from S1, who is currently high up on the board at (2, 7). This move also positions me optimally for a horizontal push to the apple's x-coordinate (5).\n\nIf S1 moves RIGHT to (3, 7), S1 is still far from the apple (5, 6) (4 steps away).\nIf S1 moves LEFT or DOWN, S1 moves further away from (5, 6).\n\nI will proceed with the aggressive, separating move **RIGHT**.\n\n## 4. Final Collision Check (Head-on)\n\nMy next head location: (4, 4).\nS1 possible next head locations: (2, 6), (1, 7), (3, 7).\n\nNo head collision risk. (4, 4) is safe.\n\n## Long-term Strategy Note for Next Turn (T42)\nMy head will be at (4, 4). The primary goal is apple (5, 6). I need to confirm the cells (5, 4) and (4, 5) are clear, and then move towards (5, 4) (RIGHT). I must watch S1's movement from (2, 7) carefully, especially if S1 starts moving horizontally into the upper-right quadrant.\nRIGHT",

Neck: (3, 4).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Outcome | Notes (Board Reference) |\n|------|---------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **UP** | (4, 5) | Safe | Clear cell. |\n| **DOWN**| (4, 3) | Safe | Clear cell. |\n| **LEFT** | (3, 4) | Die | Into own neck (3, 4). **Unsafe.** |\n| **RIGHT**| (5, 4) | Safe | Clear cell. |\n\nI have three safe moves: UP, DOWN, and RIGHT.\n\n## 2. Enemy Prediction (ID 1 Head: 3, 7)\n\nS1 is at (3, 7). Neck is (2, 7). S1 body occupies (0, 4) to (2, 8) and (1, 5). S1's body essentially blocks off the left side of the northern quadrant.\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake 1 from (3, 7):\n*   **UP (3, 8):** Safe. Moves toward apple (3, 9). (1 move away). *Most likely.*\n*   **DOWN (3, 6):** Safe. Moves away from apples, towards board center.\n*   **LEFT (2, 7):** Into neck. **Die.**\n*   **RIGHT (4, 7):** Safe. Moves away from apples, toward (5, 6).\n\nS1 is only 1 move from apple (3, 9). S1 is heavily favored to move **UP to (3, 8)** to secure (3, 9) next turn (T43).\nHowever, if S1 moves **RIGHT to (4, 7)**, this could challenge my path to (5, 6) in the next turn or two.\n\nIf S1 targets (5, 6) by moving RIGHT to (4, 7) this turn: MD from (4, 7) to (5, 6) is 1 RIGHT, 1 DOWN = 2 moves.\nMy distance to (5, 6) from (4, 4) is 3 moves (R -> U -> U).\n\nIf S1 moves UP to (3, 8): MD from (3, 8) to (5, 6) is 2 RIGHT, 2 DOWN = 4 moves. This makes S1 unlikely to challenge (5, 6) immediately.\n\nI must plan for the worst case: S1 moves RIGHT to (4, 7).\n\n## 3. Directional Decision - Reaching Apple (5, 6)\n\nTarget (5, 6). Safe options: UP, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (5, 4):**\n    *   Leads directly toward the x-coordinate of the apple.\n    *   Next turn: Head is (5, 4). Path to (5, 6) is U -> U. 2 moves remaining.\n    *   If S1 moves RIGHT to (4, 7): S1 will be 3 moves away from (5, 6) [R->U/D->U/D]. I remain ahead.\n\n*   **Move UP to (4, 5):**\n    *   Leads directly toward the y-coordinate of the apple.\n    *   Next turn: Head is (4, 5). Path to (5, 6) is R -> U. Wait, no, R to (5, 5), U to (5, 6). 2 moves remaining.\n    *   If S1 moves RIGHT to (4, 7): S1 is very close to blocking my movement with its body/head. If S1 goes (4, 7) and subsequently moves DOWN to (4, 6) or (4, 5), it could block the vertical path I need.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (4, 3):**\n    *   Increases MD to (5, 6). Avoid.\n\nComparing RIGHT to (5, 4) and UP to (4, 5):\nBoth moves leave me 2 moves from (5, 6).\n*   RIGHT to (5, 4) keeps me away from S1's immediate sphere of influence at (3, 7). If S1 rushes to (4, 7), my position at (5, 4) is relatively safe.\n*   UP to (4, 5) places my head closer to the central lane (x=4) which S1 could potentially enter (if S1 moves to 4, 7 -> 4, 6).\n\nThe move RIGHT is slightly safer against S1 interference with target (5, 6).\n\n## 4. Final Collision Check (Head-on)\n\nMy next head location: (5, 4).\nS1 likely next head location: (3, 8). (No conflict)\nS1 worst case next head location: (4, 7). (No conflict)\nIf I move RIGHT to (5, 4) and S1 moves RIGHT to (4, 7), no collision.\n\nThe coordinate (5, 6) is crucial as S1 currently leads in apples 10 to 9.\n\nI commit to securing (5, 6) by moving aggressively RIGHT.\n\n**Long-term strategy note for next turn (T43):**\nHead will be at (5, 4). The cells (5, 5) and (5, 6) are the target path. Check if (5, 5) or (5, 6) are occupied by S1 body/head. S1 is likely at (3, 8) aiming for (3, 9). Continue path UP to (5, 5) or directly to (5, 6) if safe. If (5, 5) is blocked, try LEFT/RIGHT for (6, 0) or (8, 2).\nRIGHT",

They are not threatening my path to (5, 6) this turn.\n\n## 3. Directional Decision - Reaching Apple (5, 6)\n\nTarget (5, 6) is 2 moves away (U -> U).\n\n*   **Move UP to (5, 5):**\n    *   This is the direct path for the next two turns: (5, 4) -> (5, 5) -> (5, 6) [Apple].\n    *   (5, 5) is safe.\n    *   If S1 moves to (3, 9), its body remains far away. No immediate conflict.\n\n*   **Move RIGHT to (6, 4):**\n    *   Moves away from (5, 6). MD to (5, 6) becomes 1 LEFT, 2 UP = 3 moves.\n    *   This would be chosen if the path UP was blocked or risky, but it is not.\n\n*   **Move DOWN to (5, 3):**\n    *   Moves even further away from closest apples, but potentially sets up for (6, 0).\n    *   However, (5, 6) is a much easier and closer target. Avoid this distraction unless forced.\n\nThe clear choice is **UP** to maintain the fastest route to the current primary target, (5, 6).\n\n## 4.

The target is (5, 6). Move UP to eat the apple. If S1 has also eaten (3, 9), the score will be S0: 10, S1: 11. After eating (5, 6), S0: 10, S1: 11. New targets will be (2, 9), (6, 0), (8, 2). Prioritize (2, 9) or (8, 2) based on S1 position. S1 will be at (3, 9), so (2, 9) is risky/impossible. Likely pivot to (8, 2) or (6, 0).\n\nUP",

Enemy Prediction (ID 1 Head: 3, 9)\n\nS1 is at (3, 9). It just ate an apple and is now length 12.\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake 1 from (3, 9):\n*   **UP (3, 10):** Die (Off the board). **Unsafe.**\n*   **DOWN (3, 8):** Safe, moves along its body.\n*   **LEFT (2, 9):** **Eats Apple (2, 9).** *Highly likely.*\n*   **RIGHT (4, 9):** Safe, clear cell.\n\nS1's most aggressive move is **LEFT to (2, 9)** to collect the next nearest apple. If S1 moves LEFT, my planned move UP to (5, 6) carries no risk of collision.\n\nIf S1 moves DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT, I am still safe moving UP to (5, 6).\n\n## 3. Directional Decision - Reaching Apple (5, 6)\n\nTarget (5, 6) is 1 move UP. This is an immediate apple grab.\n\n*   **Move UP to (5, 6):** Eats the apple. Score increases. Body grows. This is the optimal move.\n*   **Move LEFT to (4, 5):** Avoids apple, increases distance to (5, 6) to 2 moves. Undesirable.\n*   **Move RIGHT to (6, 5):** Avoids apple, increases distance to (5, 6) to 2 moves. Undesirable.\n\nThe decision is straightforward: grab the closest apple.\n\n## 4. Final Collision Check (Head-on)\n\nMy next head location: (5, 6).\nS1 likely next head location: (2, 9) (Apple).\n\nNo head-on collision predicted. Any unexpected move from S1 also does not lead to collision, as S1 is currently in row 9, and I am moving towards row 6.\n\n**Long-term strategy note for next turn (T45):**\nHead will be at (5, 6). I will have eaten the apple, bringing my score to 10. S1 likely ate (2, 9), bringing their score to 12.\nNew targets after this turn: (6, 0), (8, 2), (9, 8).\nThe closest remaining safe targets are (6, 0) and (8, 2) (MD 6 from (5, 6)).\nS1 is at (2, 9); they are positioned perfectly to go after (9, 8) (MD 8) or me.\nIf S1 goes for (9, 8), I should prioritize (8, 2). If S1 lingers, I might grab (6, 0).\nFrom (5, 6), (8, 2) requires 3 RIGHT, 4 DOWN. (6, 0) requires 1 RIGHT, 6 DOWN. Both are roughly equal distance but (8, 2) is further from the potential path of S1 toward (9, 8).\n\nThe immediate move is UP to secure the apple.\n\nUP",

(Wait, let's recalculate (9, 8): 4 RIGHT, 2 UP. MD=6. Closer than (6, 0) and (8, 2)).\n\nRevised Apple Distances from (5, 6):\n1. **(8, 7):** MD = 4 (3R, 1U). *Primary Target.*\n2. **(9, 8):** MD = 6 (4R, 2U).\n3. **(8, 3):** MD = 6 (3R, 3D).\n4. **(6, 0):** MD = 7 (1R, 6D).\n5. **(8, 2):** MD = 7 (3R, 4D).\n\n## 1. Safety Check for ID 0 (from 5, 6)\n\nHead: (5, 6). Neck: (5, 5).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Outcome | Notes (Board Reference) |\n|------|---------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **UP** | (5, 7) | Safe | Clear cell. |\n| **DOWN**| (5, 5) | Die | Into own neck (5, 5). **Unsafe.** |\n| **LEFT** | (4, 6) | Safe | Clear cell. |\n| **RIGHT**| (6, 6) | Safe | Clear cell. |\n\nI have three safe moves: UP (5, 7), LEFT (4, 6), and RIGHT (6, 6). I need to head towards (8, 7).\n\n*   Moving UP to (5, 7) is a good choice as it maintains a vertical path and is not directly aimed at the snake's body immediately below.\n*   Moving RIGHT to (6, 6) also moves closer to the target (8, 7) (MD 3 from 6, 6).\n\nFrom (5, 6):\n*   Target (8, 7).\n*   Move UP (5, 7): MD to target = (8-5) + (7-7) = 3 + 0 = 3 moves.\n*   Move RIGHT (6, 6): MD to target = (8-6) + (7-6) = 2 + 1 = 3 moves.\n*   Move LEFT (4, 6): MD to target = (8-4) + (7-6) = 4 + 1 = 5 moves.\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT move me closer (or maintain minimal distance) to (8, 7). RIGHT seems more aggressive toward the cluster of apples on the right side.\n\n## 2. Enemy Prediction (ID 1 Head: 2, 9)\n\nS1 is at (2, 9). It just ate an apple and is now length 13.\n\nPossible safe moves for Snake 1 from (2, 9):\n*   **UP (2, 10):** Die (Off the board). **Unsafe.**\n*   **DOWN (2, 8):** Safe, open space. Likely aiming for central path or apples (8, 7), (9, 8). MD to (8, 7) = 6 moves.\n*   **LEFT (1, 9):** Safe, open space.\n*   **RIGHT (3, 9):** Die (Into own neck). **Unsafe.**\n\nS1 must move DOWN or LEFT. If S1 moves DOWN, it might be heading toward the right side apples as well, potentially cutting me off from (9, 8) and (8, 7).\n\n*   If S1 moves DOWN to (2, 8), my move RIGHT to (6, 6) or UP to (5, 7) poses no immediate collision risk.\n*   If S1 moves LEFT to (1, 9), it is moving away from the central action.\n\nS1 is much closer to (9, 8) (MD 5 from 2, 9) than I am (MD 6 from 5, 6). S1 is also close to (8, 7) (MD 6 from 2, 9) compared to me (MD 4 from 5, 6). I have a clear advantage for (8, 7).\n\n## 3. Directional Decision - Reaching Apple (8, 7)\n\nI should prioritize reaching (8, 7) before S1 can intervene. Since S1 is at (2, 9), S1 might naturally gravitate towards (9, 8) or try to cut me off towards (8, 7).\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (6, 6)**:\n*   Next turn, I can move UP to (6, 7) or RIGHT to (7, 6).\n*   (6, 7): MD 2 to (8, 7).\n*   (7, 6): MD 2 to (8, 7).\n\nIf I move **UP to (5, 7)**:\n*   Next turn, I can move UP to (5, 8) or RIGHT to (6, 7).\n*   (5, 8): MD 3 to (8, 7).\n*   (6, 7): MD 2 to (8, 7).\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 6) centers me one column closer to the target (8, 7) and keeps me lower down, away from S1's immediate path in row 9/8. It directly sets up a path towards the right third of the board.\n\nLet's choose **RIGHT**. This puts me at (6, 6), which is 2 moves away from (8, 7) via (7, 6) then (8, 6), or (6, 7) then (7, 7) then (8, 7). The path (6, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (8, 6) is blocked by (8, 7)'s neighbor (8, 6) being clear. Wait, (8, 7) is an apple, not a wall. I need (8, 7).\nPath 1: (6, 6) -> R -> (7, 6) -> R -> (8, 6) -> U -> (8, 7). (4 moves, requires turning).\nPath 2: (6, 6) -> U -> (6, 7) -> R -> (7, 7) -> R -> (8, 7). (4 moves, requires turning).\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 6), I can then move towards (6, 7) next turn, putting me on a direct line to (8, 7).\n\nOptimal sequence to (8, 7) (MD 4: 3R, 1U):\n(5, 6) -> R -> (6, 6) (T45, MD 3)\n(6, 6) -> R (or U) -> (7, 6) or (6, 7) (T46, MD 2)\n(7, 6) -> R (or U) -> (8, 6) or (7, 7) (T47, MD 1)\n(8, 6) -> U -> (8, 7) **EAT** (T48)\n\nThe starting move RIGHT sets me up well.\n\n## 4. Long-term Strategy Note\n\n**Strategy for T46 onwards:** After moving RIGHT to (6, 6) and targeting (8, 7), the subsequent moves should aim to move diagonally up and right towards (8, 7): R, U, U or U, R, U. S1 is likely heading DOWN or LEFT. Securing (8, 7) is high priority. After (8, 7), targets will be (9, 8) and (8, 3). Since S1 is closer to (9, 8), I may shift focus to the clustered apples around (8, 3) and (8, 2) or sweep back for (6, 0).\n\n**START NEXT RATIONALE**\nTurn: 45 / 150\n\nYour Snake (ID: 0) Head: (5, 6)\nSnake #1 (ID: 1) Head: (2, 9)\nApples at: (8, 7), (9, 8), (8, 3), (6, 0), (8, 2)\n\n## Game State Analysis\n\n**Closet Apple Target:** (8, 7) (Manhattan Distance 4: 3R, 1U).\n\n## 1. Safety Check\n\nSafe moves from (5, 6): UP (5, 7), LEFT (4, 6), RIGHT (6, 6). DOWN is unsafe (into neck (5, 5)).\n\n## 2. Directional Decision\n\nMoving towards the target (8, 7). Both UP (5, 7) and RIGHT (6, 6) reduce the MD to 3.\n*   UP (5, 7) -> MD 3. Next move must be R to (6, 7) to maintain course.\n*   RIGHT (6, 6) -> MD 3. Next move can be U to (6, 7) or R to (7, 6).\n\nI choose **RIGHT** (6, 6) to position the snake more centrally on the right half of the board, allowing flexibility for vertical movement next turn and setting up a secure path to (8, 7).\n\n## 3. Enemy Prediction Review\n\nS1 is at (2, 9) and must move DOWN or LEFT. My path RIGHT avoids S1's immediate movement zone. S1 is relatively far from (8, 7) (MD 6), giving me advantage.\n\n**Long-term Strategy Note:**\nTarget (8, 7). Sequence: R, U, R, U (or similar pathfinding logic) to reach (8, 7) by T48-49. After securing (8, 7), assess S1's position and prioritize collecting (8, 3) and (8, 2) which are clustered together and less accessible for S1 due to current positioning.\n**END NEXT RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

Neck: (5, 6).\n\n| Move | Target (X, Y) | Collision Check | Outcome |\n|------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| **UP** | (6, 7) | Clear cell. | Safe |\n| **DOWN**| (6, 5) | Clear cell. | Safe |\n| **LEFT**| (5, 6) | Own neck (5, 6). | Die |\n| **RIGHT**| (7, 6) | Clear cell. | Safe |\n\nThree safe moves: UP (6, 7), DOWN (6, 5), and RIGHT (7, 6).\n\n## 2. Enemy Prediction (ID 1 Head: 1, 9)\n\nEnemy S1 is at (1, 9). Neck is (2, 9).\nS1 is trapped by the top wall (Y=9) and its own body (2, 9) to the RIGHT.\nPossible safe moves for S1:\n1. **UP (1, 10):** Die (Off board).\n2. **DOWN (1, 8):** Body segment (1, 8) is part of S1's current body. **Unsafe.**\n3. **LEFT (0, 9):** Safe. Open space.\n\nS1's only safe move is **LEFT (0, 9)**.\n\n*Wait, let's re-verify S1's body at (1, 8).*\nS1 Body: `[(2, 9), (3, 9), (3, 8), (3, 7), (2, 7), (2, 8), (1, 8), (0, 8), (0, 7), (0, 6), (0, 5), (0, 4)]`.\nYes, (1, 8) is the 7th segment currently. S1 is length 13 (Head + 12 Body). Since S1 *did not* eat an apple last turn (as per the provided board state/body list: head (1, 9), body [(2, 9), ... (0, 4)]), the tail segment (0, 4) will vacate.\nIf S1 moves DOWN to (1, 8), it hits its own body segment (1, 8). **This is an immediate death.**\n\nIf S1 moves LEFT to (0, 9), it is safe.\n\nIf S1 truly has only one safe move LEFT (0, 9), it is moving away from all high-value apples on the right side.\n\n## 3. Directional Decision for ID 0\n\nMy primary target is (8, 7) (MD 3). Both UP (6, 7) and RIGHT (7, 6) decrease/maintain minimum distance to the target.\n\n| Move | New Head | MD to (8, 7) | Notes |\n|------|----------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| **UP** | (6, 7) | (8-6)+(7-7) = 2 | Vertical alignment for subsequent R moves |\n| **DOWN**| (6, 5) | (8-6)+(7-5) = 4 | Moves away from target |\n| **RIGHT**| (7, 6) | (8-7)+(7-6) = 2 | Horizontal alignment for subsequent U moves |\n\nBoth UP to (6, 7) and RIGHT to (7, 6) are optimal in terms of MD reduction and keep me safe from S1, which is predicted to move LEFT.\n\nLet's prioritize the direction that allows for a more open follow-up path and potentially keeps me away from the wall while traversing the sparse apple area.\n\nIf I move **UP to (6, 7)**:\nNext potential moves: R (7, 7) or U (6, 8). (7, 7) leads directly to the apple cluster. (6, 8) is fine too.\n\nIf I move **RIGHT to (7, 6)**:\nNext potential moves: U (7, 7) or R (8, 6). Both lead toward the apple, but (8, 6) is very close to the (8, 7) apple.\n\nThe path R then U: (6, 6) -> (7, 6) -> (7, 7) -> (8, 7) (3 moves until apple, eating on T49).\nThe path U then R: (6, 6) -> (6, 7) -> (7, 7) -> (8, 7) (3 moves until apple, eating on T49).\n\nSince both lead to eating the apple by Turn 49, and S1 is retreating LEFT, I will choose the move that keeps me most flexible for following apples like (8, 3) and avoiding potential wall issues. Moving RIGHT to (7, 6) gives me more horizontal space to work with immediately and sets up a clean U turn towards the apple.\n\nAlso, moving RIGHT to (7, 6) gives me the option of moving RIGHT again to (8, 6), which is only one move away from the apple (8, 7) OR only three moves away from the cluster (8, 3), (8, 2). This allows for quick pivoting if (8, 7) is intercepted or if another appealing apple suddenly pops up.\n\nI choose **RIGHT** to (7, 6).\n\n## 4. Collision Check with S1\nS1 moves LEFT to (0, 9). My move RIGHT to (7, 6). No collision risk.\n\n## 5. Long-term Strategy Note\n\n**Strategy for T47 onwards:** After moving RIGHT to (7, 6), the immediate priority is to eat (8, 7). The sequence should be U to (7, 7) then R to (8, 7) or R to (8, 6) then U to (8, 7). Since S1 is isolated LEFT, secure target (8, 7) by T49. After eating (8, 7), the snake will be long (11 segments). Next cluster targets are (8, 3) and (8, 2), closely followed by (9, 8) if S1 hasn't claimed it.\n\n**START NEXT RATIONALE**\nTurn: 46 / 150\n\nYour Snake (ID: 0) Head: (6, 6)\nSnake #1 (ID: 1) Head: (1, 9)\nApples at: (8, 7) [MD 3], (8, 3) [MD 5], (9, 8) [MD 5].\n\n## Game State Analysis\n\n**Primary Target:** (8, 7) (MD 3).\n\n## 1. Safety Check\n\nSafe moves from (6, 6): UP (6, 7), DOWN (6, 5), RIGHT (7, 6). LEFT (5, 6) is unsafe (neck).\n\n## 2. Enemy Prediction\n\nSnake #1 is at (1, 9) and is heavily restricted. Its only safe move is predicted to be LEFT to (0, 9). This move minimizes collision danger and confirms the primary target (8, 7) is uncontested by S1 this turn.\n\n## 3. Directional Decision\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT reduce the Manhattan Distance to the target (8, 7) to 2.\n*   Moving **RIGHT** to (7, 6) places the snake on a clear horizontal path in the open area of the board. This allows for flexibility to move U or R on the next turn, enabling a quick reach to (8, 7) (via R then U, or U then R towards 8, 7) and maintaining options toward the clustered apples (8, 3) and (8, 2) below.\n\nI choose RIGHT.\n**END NEXT RATIONALE**\nRIGHT",

It is surrounded by walls (X=0, Y=9) and its own body segments at (1, 9) (Neck) and (0, 8) (Body). Since its tail (0, 5) will vacate, no adjacent cells will become safe for S1 by tail movement.
