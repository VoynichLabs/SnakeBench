The closest to them are (4, 2), (5, 3), (6, 0), (7, 2).\n- They're far from me, so no immediate collision risk.\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- Going UP keeps me on the left edge but moves toward (0, 5) apple.\n- After getting (0, 5), I can head toward (1, 7) and (2, 8) apples which are in the upper left area.\n- The left side of the board has several apples: (0, 5), (1, 7), (3, 7), (2, 8).\n\n**Long-term plan:** \n- Move UP toward (0, 5) to collect that apple (3 moves away)\n- Then head toward the upper left cluster: (1, 7), (3, 7), (2, 8)\n- Keep distance from the enemy who is operating more on the right side\n\nUP is clearly the better choice as it moves toward apples and keeps good options open.\n\nUP",

No walls, no snake bodies, no apple there.\n\nSo my only safe moves are **UP** or **RIGHT**.\n\nLooking at nearby apples:\n- (4, 5) - apple at my current y-level, 4 cells to the right\n- (3, 7) - apple 3 right, 2 up\n- (1, 7) - apple 1 right, 2 up - VERY CLOSE!\n- (2, 8) - apple 2 right, 3 up\n- (5, 8) - apple 5 right, 3 up\n- (6, 8) - apple 6 right, 3 up\n\nThe upper-left cluster of apples is excellent: (1, 7), (3, 7), (2, 8), (5, 8), (6, 8)\n\n**Comparing UP vs RIGHT:**\n\n- **UP** (0, 6): Gets me closer to (1, 7). Path would be: UP to (0,6), then RIGHT to (1,6), then UP to (1,7) = APPLE in 3 moves!\n- **RIGHT** (1, 5): Path to (1,7): RIGHT to (1,5), UP to (1,6), UP to (1,7) = APPLE in 3 moves!\n\nBoth paths get to (1, 7) in 3 moves. Let me think about safety and flexibility:\n\n- UP keeps me on the left edge (less flexible, but enemy is far)\n- RIGHT gives me more room to maneuver\n\nEnemy analysis:\n- Enemy at (5, 4) is far from me (5+ cells away)\n- Enemy might go for (4, 5), (4, 2), (9, 3), or (7, 2) apples\n- No immediate collision risk\n\nI'll go UP to continue toward the (1, 7) apple cluster. This keeps my path simple and I can collect (1, 7), then potentially (3, 7), (2, 8).\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n1. This turn: UP to (0, 6)\n2. Next turn: RIGHT to (1, 6) or UP to (0, 7)\n3. Target (1, 7) apple first, then sweep through upper-left cluster\n4. Watch enemy movements - they may compete for upper apples\n\nUP",

This is my own body segment.\n\n2. **DOWN** (4, 7): Safe - empty space. But wait, let me check - the enemy body has (3, 7) nearby but (4, 7) appears empty.\n\n3. **LEFT** (3, 8): Safe - empty space. No obstacles there.\n\n4. **RIGHT** (5, 8): There's an APPLE here! This would give me 5 apples and put me ahead.\n\nLet me verify RIGHT (5, 8):\n- Not off board \u2713\n- Not my body \u2713\n- Not enemy body (enemy body is at 3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7) - none at (5,8) \u2713\n- There's an apple at (5, 8) \u2713\n\nLet me check for potential head-on collision:\n- Enemy head is at (3, 3)\n- For enemy to reach (5, 8), they'd need to move 5 steps - impossible in one turn\n- No risk of head-on collision at (5, 8)\n\n**Analysis of moves:**\n\n**RIGHT to (5, 8)**: \n- APPLE! Gain a point, go to 5 apples (take the lead!)\n- Then next turn I can go to (6, 8) for another apple\n- Very good positioning for the apple cluster\n\n**DOWN to (4, 7)**:\n- Safe but misses the apple opportunity\n- Would then need to go right to get (5, 8)\n\n**LEFT to (3, 8)**:\n- Safe but moves away from apples\n- Getting closer to where enemy snake's body extends\n\nThe best move is clearly RIGHT to collect the apple at (5, 8).\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: RIGHT to (5, 8) - collect apple! (5 apples)\n2. Next turn: RIGHT to (6, 8) - collect another apple! (6 apples)\n3. Then consider DOWN to (6, 7) or continue right\n4. Good targets after: (5, 7), (6, 5), (9, 7), (9, 9)\n\nThe enemy is down at (3, 3) and their body blocks column 3 from y=4 to y=7. They're likely going for apples in the lower area like (4, 2), (7, 2), (7, 3), (9, 3). I should focus on the upper right area apples.\n\nRIGHT",

That's a 2-move path to an apple.\n\nIf I go RIGHT to (7, 8), I'm heading toward the right side apples but they're further away.\n\nIf I go UP to (6, 9), I'm getting closer to (9, 9) but still several moves away.\n\nDOWN seems best because:\n1. It positions me to collect (5, 7) apple next turn\n2. After that, I can go toward (6, 5) or continue to other apples\n3. It keeps me in open space with good options\n\n**Plan for next turns:**\n1. This turn: DOWN to (6, 7)\n2. Next turn: LEFT to (5, 7) - collect apple! (7 apples)\n3. Then work toward (6, 5) or swing right toward (9, 7)\n\nThe enemy is busy in the lower area around (3, 1), probably going for (3, 0), (4, 2), or similar.

No obstacles.\n\n3. **LEFT** (5, 5): DEATH! This is my own body segment (the first body segment behind my head).\n\n4. **RIGHT** (7, 5): Safe - empty space.

Then I have options:\n- LEFT to (6, 0) for another apple\n- RIGHT to (8, 0) empty, then (9, 0) for apple\nThe enemy is on the far left side near the top now, so staying on the right side is safer. After clearing the bottom row apples, I can work my way up the right side for apples at (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 7), (9, 9), (8, 9), (8, 4).\n\nDOWN",

Blocked\n- Only DOWN available, leading to potential trap\n\nUP is clearly better - it leads toward apples and keeps more options open.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (5, 9):\n- It might go DOWN to (5, 8), LEFT to (4, 9) is its body, RIGHT to (6, 9), or UP is off board\n- Enemy is far from my position, no collision risk\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 34: UP to (8, 5)\n- Turn 35: UP to (8, 6)\n- Turn 36: UP to (8, 7)\n- Turn 37: UP to (8, 8)\n- Turn 38: UP to (8, 9) - APPLE!\n- Then possibly RIGHT to (9, 9) for another apple!\n\nThis path gets me 2 apples with a clear route.

DEATH!\n\n4. **RIGHT** (9, 5): \n   - Not off board \u2713\n   - Not my body \u2713\n   - Not enemy body \u2713\n   - Safe move, leads toward (9, 6) and (9, 7) apples\n\nSafe moves: UP and RIGHT\n\n**Analysis of UP (8, 6):**\n- From (8, 6), options would be:\n  - UP to (8, 7) - clear\n  - LEFT to (7, 6) - clear\n  - DOWN to (8, 5) - will be my body\n  - RIGHT to (9, 6) - APPLE at (9, 6)!\n- Multiple good options\n\n**Analysis of RIGHT (9, 5):**\n- From (9, 5), options would be:\n  - UP to (9, 6) - APPLE at (9, 6)!\n  - DOWN to (9, 4) - my body!\n  - LEFT to (8, 5) - will be my body\n  - RIGHT - off board!\n- Only UP is available next turn - more restricted\n\nEnemy snake at (6, 9):\n- Might go DOWN to (6, 8), RIGHT to (7, 9), or LEFT to (5, 9) which is body\n- Far from my position\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT lead toward apples at (9, 6) and (9, 7). However:\n- RIGHT (9, 5) only leaves UP as the next safe move (edge of board)\n- UP (8, 6) gives me multiple options next turn\n\n**Strategy for next turns:**\n- Turn 35: UP to (8, 6)\n- Turn 36: RIGHT to (9, 6) - APPLE!\n- Turn 37: UP to (9, 7) - APPLE!\n- Then possibly continue to (9, 8), (9, 9) - APPLE!\n\nGoing UP keeps more options open while still providing a clear path to multiple apples on the right side.\n\nUP",

The first segment after my head. DEATH!\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT\n\n**Enemy snake analysis:**\n- Head at (4, 8)\n- Enemy body includes (5, 8), (6, 8), etc.\n- Options from (4, 8):\n  - UP to (4, 9) - that's enemy tail position marked as T... wait, checking board: (4, 9) shows T which is enemy tail\n  - DOWN to (4, 7) - clear, has apple there!\n  - LEFT to (3, 8) - clear, has apple at (3, 8)!\n  - RIGHT to (5, 8) - its own body!\n- Enemy can go UP, DOWN, or LEFT\n\n**Collision risk analysis:**\n- If I go UP to (4, 7) and enemy goes DOWN to (4, 7) - HEAD-ON COLLISION! \n- Both would die, but I have 22 apples vs 11, so I'd win... but risky\n- If I go LEFT to (3, 6) - safe from enemy collision\n- If I go DOWN to (4, 5) - safe from enemy collision\n\n**Evaluating options:**\n\n**UP (4, 7):**\n- APPLE HERE! +1 point\n- RISKY! Enemy could go DOWN to (4, 7) causing head-on collision\n- If we collide, I win (22 > 11), but it's still a risk\n\n**LEFT (3, 6):**\n- No apple\n- Safe from enemy collision\n- Opens path to (1, 6) apple and (2, 7), (1, 7), (3, 7) apples\n\n**DOWN (4, 5):**\n- No apple\n- Safe from enemy collision\n- Moves toward (5, 4) apple area\n\nEnemy will likely want apples too. From (4, 8), going DOWN to (4, 7) or LEFT to (3, 8) both give apples.\n\nActually, if enemy goes LEFT to (3, 8), then (4, 7) is safe for me!\nIf enemy goes DOWN to (4, 7), we collide but I win.\n\nGiven I have a significant lead and can force a win on collision, UP seems reasonable. But let me consider the safer play...\n\nActually, the safest strategy is to avoid risk when I'm already ahead. Going LEFT to (3, 6) keeps me safe and positions me toward the apple cluster at (1, 6), (1, 7), (2, 7), (3, 7).\n\nBut wait - the apple at (4, 7) is very tempting and even if we collide, I win the game immediately since I have more apples.\n\nLet me go with UP - either I get the apple, or we collide and I win with 22 > 11.\n\nUP",

After (1, 6), I can continue collecting apples on the left side: (0, 5) is nearby, then I can work toward (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 2), (0, 0).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Get apple at (1, 6) this turn\n- Then consider (0, 5) which is one step left\n- Work down the left side to collect the cluster of apples at (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (0, 0)\n- Need 24 more apples to reach 50\n\nDOWN",

Yes, Snake #0 could choose to move LEFT into (0,7) to try to force a head-on, but their better option is to go DOWN into the apple at (1,6), so the most reasonable play for them avoids that confrontation. I\u2019ll go DOWN into (0,7) to start descending the left flank toward the apples near (0,5) and (0,0) where Snake #0 can\u2019t easily follow.\n\nPlan: After this move, keep moving down the left column to pick up apples at (0,5) and then swing toward the cluster around (1,1)/(1,2)/(1,4) before turning east along the bottom to grab the apples at (5,0)/(6,0); avoid running into Snake #0\u2019s upcoming path and stay away from the congested center until they commit elsewhere.\n\nDOWN",

There are SO many apples on the board still.\n\n**Best strategy:**\nGoing LEFT to (0, 5) risks head-on collision with enemy who can only go DOWN to (0, 5). While I'd \"win\" the collision (27 > 13), I should consider:\n- If we both die, game ends and I win\n- If I avoid it, I stay alive and can collect more apples\n\nActually, winning by collision is still winning! But there's value in staying alive to guarantee the win more cleanly.\n\nLet me go DOWN to (1, 4) - this avoids the collision, and from (1, 4) I can access apples at (1, 2), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), etc.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Go DOWN now to (1, 4)\n- Then continue to (1, 3), (1, 2) for apple\n- Collect the cluster at (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), etc.\n- Enemy is nearly trapped on left side\n\nDOWN",

Death\n  - DOWN to (0, 4) - empty, possible move\n  - LEFT to (-1, 5) - off board, death\n  - RIGHT to (1, 5) - my body segment! Death for them\n\nSo enemy can ONLY go DOWN to (0, 4)!\n\n**Collision risk assessment:**\n- If I go LEFT to (0, 4) and enemy goes DOWN to (0, 4) - HEAD-ON COLLISION!\n- I would win with 27 > 14, but both would die and game ends\n\nSince enemy MUST go to (0, 4), I should NOT go LEFT.\n\n**Apple analysis:**\nLooking at nearby apples:\n- (3, 4) - apple, can reach by going RIGHT twice\n- (5, 4), (6, 4) - apples further right\n- (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2) - cluster below\n- (1, 1), (0, 1), (0, 0) - bottom left cluster\n\n**Best move evaluation:**\n- DOWN (1, 3): Gets me closer to the apple cluster at row 2 and below. From (1, 3) I can go to (1, 2) for an apple.\n- RIGHT (2, 4): Gets me closer to apples at (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4). From (2, 4) I can go to (3, 4) for an apple.\n\nBoth are good options. Going RIGHT toward (3, 4) seems great because there's a dense cluster of apples at (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3).\n\nGoing DOWN also works well - leads to (1, 2) apple and nearby cluster.\n\nI'll go RIGHT to position myself for the apple cluster at (3, 4) and beyond. The enemy will be trapped on the left side and can only go to (0, 4), then likely (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0) - collecting those apples but getting trapped.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Go RIGHT to (2, 4)\n- Then RIGHT to (3, 4) for apple\n- Continue collecting apples at (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 3)\n- Enemy is trapped on far left column\n\nRIGHT",

Death\n  - DOWN to (0, 1) - apple there, possible move\n  - LEFT to (-1, 2) - off board, death\n  - RIGHT to (1, 2) - apple there, possible move\n\nEnemy will likely go DOWN to (0, 1) or RIGHT to (1, 2) for apples.\n\n**Apple analysis:**\nBoth DOWN (3, 2) and RIGHT (4, 3) give me apples immediately!\n\nLooking at follow-up moves:\n- If I go DOWN to (3, 2): Next turn I can go LEFT to (2, 2) for another apple, or RIGHT to (4, 2) for another apple\n- If I go RIGHT to (4, 3): Next turn I can go DOWN to (4, 2) for apple, or RIGHT to (5, 3) - no apple, or UP to (4, 4) - no apple\n\nRow 2 has a massive cluster of apples: (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 2). If I go DOWN to (3, 2), I'm right in the middle of this cluster and can collect multiple apples efficiently.\n\n**Collision risk:**\nIf enemy goes RIGHT to (1, 2), we won't collide since I'm going to (3, 2) or (4, 3).\n\n**Decision:**\nDOWN to (3, 2) puts me in the center of the apple cluster in row 2, allowing me to sweep through multiple apples. This is the optimal choice.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Go DOWN to (3, 2) for apple\n- Then sweep through row 2: either LEFT to (2, 2) or RIGHT to (4, 2)\n- Continue collecting row 2 apples\n- Enemy is going for bottom-left area - stay clear and maintain lead\n- Watch for potential trap situations given my very long body\n\nDOWN",

Great position.\n\nLet me evaluate each direction from my head at (4, 3):\n\n1. **UP** (4, 4):\n   - Not off board \u2713\n   - Let me check... my body has (2, 4), (1, 4) - (4, 4) is NOT in my body \u2713\n   - Not enemy body \u2713\n   - No apple at (4, 4)\n   - Safe move\n\n2. **DOWN** (4, 2):\n   - This is my own body segment (first body piece)!\n   - DEATH - can't go backwards\n\n3. **LEFT** (3, 3):\n   - This is my own body segment!\n   - DEATH - can't go here\n\n4. **RIGHT** (5, 3):\n   - Not off board \u2713\n   - Not my body \u2713\n   - Not enemy body \u2713\n   - No apple at (5, 3)\n   - Safe move\n\nSafe moves: UP, RIGHT (DOWN and LEFT are into my body)\n\n**Enemy snake analysis:**\n- Head at (1, 0)\n- Options from (1, 0):\n  - UP to (1, 1) - there's an APPLE at (1, 1), free space\n  - DOWN to (1, -1) - off board, death\n  - LEFT to (0, 0) - its own body! Death\n  - RIGHT to (2, 0) - free space\n\nThe enemy can go UP (to apple) or RIGHT. It will likely go UP to get the apple at (1, 1).\n\n**Apple analysis:**\nLooking at nearby apples:\n- (5, 4) - can reach by going UP then RIGHT, or RIGHT then UP\n- (6, 3) - can reach by going RIGHT twice\n- (6, 4) - nearby cluster\n- (5, 5) - nearby\n- (4, 5) - can reach by going UP twice\n\nIf I go **UP** to (4, 4):\n- Then I can go UP again to (4, 5) for an apple\n- Or RIGHT to (5, 4) for an apple\n- Good positioning for the cluster\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (5, 3):\n- Then I can go UP to (5, 4) for an apple\n- Or RIGHT to (6, 3) for an apple\n- Also good positioning\n\nBoth moves seem good. Let me think about which gives better access:\n\nGoing RIGHT to (5, 3) puts me adjacent to:\n- (6, 3) - APPLE\n- (5, 4) - APPLE  \n- (5, 2) - APPLE\n\nGoing UP to (4, 4) puts me adjacent to:\n- (4, 5) - APPLE\n- (5, 4) - APPLE\n\nRIGHT seems slightly better - more immediate apple options!\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Go RIGHT to (5, 3)\n- Then collect apples at (6, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (5, 5), (7, 3), (7, 6)\n- Stay in the center-right area where apple density is high\n- Enemy is far in bottom-left, collecting its own apples\n- Keep collecting to reach 50 first\n\nRIGHT",

Excellent position.\n\nLet me evaluate each direction from my head at (5, 3):\n\n1. **UP** (5, 4):\n   - Not off board \u2713\n   - Not my body \u2713\n   - Not enemy body \u2713\n   - APPLE at (5, 4)! \u2713\n   - Safe move with apple!\n\n2. **DOWN** (5, 2):\n   - Not off board \u2713\n   - Not my body \u2713\n   - Not enemy body \u2713\n   - APPLE at (5, 2)! \u2713\n   - Safe move with apple!\n\n3. **LEFT** (4, 3):\n   - This is my own body segment (first body piece after head)!\n   - DEATH - can't go backwards\n\n4. **RIGHT** (6, 3):\n   - Not off board \u2713\n   - Not my body \u2713\n   - Not enemy body \u2713\n   - APPLE at (6, 3)! \u2713\n   - Safe move with apple!\n\nSafe moves: UP, DOWN, RIGHT (all with apples!)\n\n**Enemy snake analysis:**\n- Head at (2, 0)\n- Looking at board, enemy has body extending along the left side\n- Options from (2, 0):\n  - UP to (2, 1) - free space\n  - DOWN to (2, -1) - off board, death\n  - LEFT to (1, 0) - its own body! Death\n  - RIGHT to (3, 0) - free space\n\nEnemy will likely go UP or RIGHT. Far from me, no collision risk.\n\n**Apple cluster analysis:**\nI'm surrounded by apples! At (5, 3), I have apples in three directions:\n- (5, 4) UP - apple\n- (5, 2) DOWN - apple\n- (6, 3) RIGHT - apple\n\nAll three are excellent choices. Let me think about follow-up options:\n\nIf I go **UP** to (5, 4):\n- Then I can go UP to (5, 5) for another apple\n- Or RIGHT to (6, 4) for another apple\n- Good chain potential\n\nIf I go **DOWN** to (5, 2):\n- Then I can continue to (6, 2), (7, 2)... less apples that direction\n- But there's (2, 2), (1, 2) apples down there\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6, 3):\n- Then UP to (6, 4) for apple\n- Or RIGHT to (7, 3) for apple\n- Good chain potential\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT give good apple chains. UP leads to (5, 4) \u2192 (5, 5) \u2192 (4, 5) \u2192 potential cluster.\nRIGHT leads to (6, 3) \u2192 (7, 3) \u2192 or (6, 4) \u2192 good chain.\n\nLooking at my body, my tail extends through (7, 0) on the bottom right. Going UP keeps me in the middle area with good apple density.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Go UP to (5, 4) for apple\n- Then (5, 5) or (6, 4) for more apples\n- Continue harvesting the center cluster\n- Stay ahead and reach 50 first!\n\nUP",

Far from me, no collision risk.\n\n**Apple analysis:**\nFrom (5, 4), I have:\n- (5, 5) UP - apple, then can reach (4, 5) for another apple\n- (6, 4) RIGHT - apple, then can reach (7, 5) or (6, 3) was already taken\n\nIf I go **UP** to (5, 5):\n- Then LEFT to (4, 5) for another apple\n- Good chain: (5, 5) \u2192 (4, 5) \u2192 possible more\n\nIf I go **RIGHT** to (6, 4):\n- Then UP to (6, 5) or (7, 4)\n- (7, 5) has apple, (7, 6) has apple\n\nLooking at the board more carefully:\n- My body creates a complex shape\n- Going UP keeps me in a good position with apple at (5, 5), then (4, 5)\n- Going RIGHT to (6, 4) is also good, leads to (7, 5), (7, 6) apples\n\nBoth UP and RIGHT are excellent. Let me check body positioning:\n- My body at (5, 6), (6, 6), (6, 7) is to my upper right\n- Going UP to (5, 5) is safe, then I can go LEFT to (4, 5)\n- Going RIGHT to (6, 4) is safe, then I need to navigate around my body at (6, 6)\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Go UP to (5, 5) for apple\n- Then LEFT to (4, 5) for another apple\n- Continue collecting center apples\n- Maintain my significant lead and reach 50!\n\nUP",

Great position.\n\nLet me evaluate each direction from my head at (4, 5):\n\n1. **UP** (4, 6):\n   - Looking at the board, (4, 6) is part of my body!\n   - DEATH - can't go here\n\n2. **DOWN** (4, 4):\n   - Looking at the board, position (4, 4) appears to be empty\n   - Not off board \u2713\n   - Let me check my body... (3, 4) is body, but (4, 4) looks free\n   - Safe move\n\n3. **LEFT** (3, 5):\n   - Not off board \u2713\n   - Checking body positions... (3, 4) is body, (3, 3) is body, (3, 2) is body\n   - (3, 5) appears to be empty\n   - Safe move\n\n4. **RIGHT** (5, 5):\n   - This is my own body segment (first body piece after head)!\n   - DEATH - can't go backwards\n\nSafe moves: DOWN, LEFT\n\n**Enemy snake analysis:**\n- Head at (5, 0)\n- Apple at (6, 0) right next to it\n- Enemy will likely go RIGHT to grab that apple\n- Far from me, no collision risk\n\n**Apple analysis from current position (4, 5):**\n- Nearest apples: (5, 7), (7, 6), (7, 5), (6, 4), (6, 3)\n- Going DOWN to (4, 4) - no apple but moves toward (6, 4), (6, 3)\n- Going LEFT to (3, 5) - no apple, moves away from most apples\n\nLooking at the board more carefully:\n- If I go DOWN to (4, 4), I can then potentially go DOWN again or RIGHT toward the apples at (6, 4), (6, 3), (7, 3)\n- If I go LEFT to (3, 5), I'm moving away from the apple cluster\n\nMy body is massive and wraps around. I need to be careful not to trap myself.\n\nFrom (4, 4):\n- Can go LEFT to (3, 4) - but that's my body!\n- Can go DOWN to (4, 3) - that's my body at (4, 3)!\n- Can go RIGHT to (5, 4) - that's my body!\n- Can go UP back to (4, 5) - but that would be where my body was\n\nWait, let me reconsider. After I move, my tail moves too (unless I eat an apple). Let me check again.\n\nFrom (4, 4) next turn:\n- My tail at (7, 0) will move, so (7, 0) becomes free\n- But most of my body will still be there\n\nGoing DOWN seems risky as I might box myself in.\n\nGoing LEFT to (3, 5):\n- From (3, 5) I could go DOWN to (3, 4) - but body is there? Let me check... yes (3, 4) is body\n- Could go UP to (3, 6) - need to check... looks free\n- Could go LEFT to (2, 5) - looks free\n\nLEFT seems to give me more future options and keeps me in open space.\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Go LEFT to maintain maneuverability\n- Then work around toward apples at (2, 9), (1, 9), (5, 7) area\n- Keep 17 apple lead and avoid getting trapped by my own body\n\nLEFT",

NO\n- This is tricky...\n\nWait, by the time I get there, my tail will have moved. Let me count - my tail is at (8, 0). Each turn the tail moves unless I eat an apple.\n\nGoing UP seems slightly better as it keeps me moving toward the top apples (2, 9), (1, 9), (5, 9).\n\n**Long-term plan:**\n- Navigate carefully, my body is huge\n- Head toward top row apples\n- Avoid getting trapped by my own body\n\nUP",

Great position.\n\nLet me evaluate each direction from my head at (2, 6):\n\n1. **UP** (2, 7):\n   - Looking at my body list: (2, 7) is in my body!\n   - DEATH - can't go here\n\n2. **DOWN** (2, 5):\n   - Checking my body list... (2, 5) is not in my body\n   - Looking at the board, position (2, 5) shows \".\" which means empty\n   - Safe move!\n\n3. **LEFT** (1, 6):\n   - Looking at my body list: (1, 6) is in my body!\n   - DEATH - can't go here\n\n4. **RIGHT** (3, 6):\n   - This is my first body segment (directly behind head)\n   - DEATH - can't go backwards\n\nOnly safe move: DOWN to (2, 5)\n\nLet me verify (2, 5) is truly safe:\n- My body list doesn't include (2, 5)\n- Enemy snake head is at (6, 2) - far away\n- No collision risk with enemy\n\n**Enemy snake analysis:**\n- Head at (6, 2)\n- There's an apple at (5, 2) - enemy might go LEFT for it\n- There's an apple at (6, 3) - enemy might go UP for it\n- Enemy is far from me, no head-on collision risk\n\n**Future planning from (2, 5):**\nFrom (2, 5), I need to check options:\n- My body at (2, 4) is there, so can't go DOWN immediately\n- But (1, 5) is my body too\n- (3, 5) is my body\n\nWait, let me re-check the board... From (2, 5):\n- The board shows T's (body) all around that area\n- I need to be careful about trapping myself\n\nLooking at the board more carefully:\n```\n 5 T T . T T T . A T .\n```\nPosition (2, 5) is shown as \".\" - empty/safe!\n\nAfter moving DOWN to (2, 5), from there:\n- UP back to (2, 6) - where I came from, tail will have moved\n- DOWN to (2, 4) - that's my body T\n- LEFT to (1, 5) - that's my body T\n- RIGHT to (3, 5) - that's my body T\n\nHmm, this is concerning. But my tail at (9, 1) will move, creating space somewhere. The snake is long, so I need to trust the tail movement.\n\nActually, when I move DOWN, my tail moves from (9, 1), so (9, 1) becomes free. But that doesn't help at (2, 5).\n\nWait - after I move to (2, 5), my current head position (2, 6) becomes body, but the tail end (9, 1) disappears. So from (2, 5) I could go UP back to (2, 6)? No wait, (2, 6) would become part of my body after this move.\n\nLet me trace: After moving DOWN to (2, 5):\n- New head: (2, 5)\n- Body starts with old head (2, 6), then continues...\n- Tail at (9, 1) disappears\n\nSo from (2, 5), going UP to (2, 6) would hit my new body. \n\nThis is a tight spot but DOWN is my only option right now. I'll need to find a path through.\n\n**Strategy note for next turn:**\nFrom (2, 5), I need to find an escape route. The tail is constantly moving, creating new spaces. Look for the tail end disappearing and potential paths opening up. Target the apple cluster at (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3) which should be accessible once body segments clear.\n\nDOWN",

I stay away from Snake #0\u2019s dense body and keep space for follow-up moves.\n\nPlan: After taking (7,3), continue through the adjacent column to ring the (7,5)/(7,6)/(7,9) apples, then swing back toward the 5\u20136 columns to track more fruit while avoiding getting boxed in by the enemy\u2019s long tail.\n\nRIGHT",

Great position.\n\nLet me evaluate each direction from my head at (2, 5):\n\n1. **UP** (2, 6):\n   - Looking at my body list: (2, 6) is in my body!\n   - DEATH - can't go here\n\n2. **DOWN** (2, 4):\n   - Looking at my body list: (2, 4) is in my body!\n   - DEATH - can't go here\n\n3. **LEFT** (1, 5):\n   - Looking at my body list: (1, 5) is in my body!\n   - DEATH - can't go here\n\n4. **RIGHT** (3, 5):\n   - Looking at my body list: (3, 5) is in my body!\n   - DEATH - can't go here\n\nWait, this looks really bad! Let me re-check the board:\n```\n 5 T T 0 T T T . A T .\n```\nPosition (2, 5) has my head \"0\". Looking around:\n- (1, 5) = T (body)\n- (3, 5) = T (body)\n- (2, 6) = T (body)\n- (2, 4) = T (body)\n\nBut wait - my tail is at (9, 2) based on the body list ending at (9, 2). When I move, my tail moves too!\n\nLet me check my full body list again:\nBody ends with: ...(9, 4), (9, 3), (9, 2)\n\nSo my tail is at (9, 2). When I move, (9, 2) becomes free.\n\nBut that doesn't help me at position (2, 5) - the tail is way over at (9, 2).\n\nHmm, looking at the board more carefully:\n```\n 6 T T T T T T T A T T\n 5 T T 0 T T T . A T .\n 4 T T T T . T A . T T\n```\n\nWait, I need to verify - my body is 34 segments long. Let me count the body coordinates... they're all \"T\" on the board.\n\nActually, let me look at this differently. The board shows:\n- (2, 5) is my head \"0\"\n- All adjacent cells show \"T\" (body segments)\n\nBut the tail at (9, 2) will disappear when I move. That space is far from my head though.\n\nActually wait - the board at row 2 shows:\n```\n 2 T A A T T A T . . T\n```\nPosition (9, 2) shows \"T\" which is my tail.\n\nI appear to be trapped! But let me double-check each direction one more time:\n\nFrom (2, 5):\n- UP to (2, 6): In body list? Yes, (2, 6) is the first body segment - DEATH\n- DOWN to (2, 4): In body list? Yes, (2, 4) is in body - DEATH  \n- LEFT to (1, 5): In body list? Yes, (1, 5) is in body - DEATH\n- RIGHT to (3, 5): In body list? Yes, (3, 5) is in body - DEATH\n\nThis is a critical situation. All four directions lead into my own body!\n\nWait - I need to check if any of these positions is my TAIL which will move away. My tail is at (9, 2) per the body list. None of (2, 6), (2, 4), (1, 5), (3, 5) is my tail.\n\nUnless... let me look at the body list ending again: the list ends with (9, 2), so that's the tail.\n\nI'm completely surrounded by my own body. This seems like I've trapped myself!\n\nBut I must choose a move. If all moves kill me, I should pick one anyway. Let me verify once more... \n\nActually, the only possibility is if I misread something. Let me trust the board: all T's around me means all body. I must pick a direction.\n\nSince I must move, I'll go DOWN - at least I die trying to reach the apple cluster at (1,2), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nDOWN",
