The (6, 4) apple is also relatively close.\n2. **Enemy positioning**: Enemy snake is at (0, 6). If it moves DOWN, it could head toward (6, 6) or (6, 4) apples.\n3. **Avoiding dead-ends**: Moving LEFT to (0, 3) gets me closer to the left wall, which could limit future options.\n\n**Optimal move analysis:**\n- Moving RIGHT toward (2, 3) puts me on a path toward the (3, 1) apple and keeps my options open\n- Moving UP toward (1, 4) or DOWN toward (1, 2) doesn't directly advance toward any apple\n- Moving LEFT toward (0, 3) gets me closer to the wall\n\n**Strategy for next few turns:**\nI should move RIGHT to (2, 3), then continue toward the (3, 1) apple at (3, 1). This apple is the closest and seems least likely to be contested by the enemy snake, which is currently positioned to go for the (6, 6) or (6, 4) apples.

          "rationale": "There is a contradiction in the board state provided in the prompt.\n1.  **Text State:** Shows Snake #1 at `(1, 3)`.\n2.  **Grid State:** Shows `1` at `(9, 2)`.\n3.  **Relative Position:** My head is at `(0, 6)`. The enemy at `(9, 2)` is far away (distance 7 X + 4 Y = 11 moves). The enemy at `(1, 3)` is much closer (distance 1 X + 3 Y = 4 moves). Since the \"Text State\" is explicitly labeled \"Enemy snakes\" and the grid is often an ASCII representation that might be simplified or misaligned, I will prioritize the **Text State** location `(1, 3)` as it is explicitly defined as the current state, assuming the grid might be illustrative or pre-movement. However, looking closely at the grid, the enemy `1` is definitely at `(9, 2)` visually. But the text says `(1,3)`. Let's look at the grid again.\n    `9 . . . . . . . . . .`\n    ...\n    `3 . 1 . . . . . . . .` -> This is `(1, 3)`. The prompt says \"Snake #1 - Head: (1, 3)\". **Visual match found.**\n    Wait, let me re-read the grid row 2.\n    `2 . . . . . . . . A`\n    And row 9?\n    `9 . . . . . . . . . .`\n    The prompt says \"Snake #1 - Head: (1, 3)\". The grid shows `1` at `(1, 3)`. The prompt text \"Apples at: (9, 2)\" matches the `A` at `y=2, x=9`.\n    **Correction:** My previous analysis of the grid was slightly off regarding the visual `1` placement. The visual `1` IS at `(1, 3)`.\n    **Wait.** Let me re-read the grid one last time to be absolutely sure.\n    Row 9: `9 . . . . . . . . . .`\n    Row 8: `8 . . . . . . . . . .`\n    Row 7: `7 . . . . . . . . . .`\n    Row 6: `6 0 . . . . . A . . .` (My head at 0,6. Apple at 6,6)\n    Row 5: `5 . . . . . . . . . .`\n    Row 4: `4 . . . . . . A . . .` (Apple at 6,4)\n    Row 3: `3 . 1 . . . . . . . .` (Snake #1 at 1,3)\n    Row 2: `2 . . . . . . . . A` (Apple at 8,2? Wait, prompt says 9,2. Let's count indices 0-9)\n        Index 0: `.` (x=0)\n        ...\n        Index 7: `.` (x=7)\n        Index 8: `A` (x=8)\n        Index 9: `.` (x=9)\n        So Grid says `(8,2)`. Prompt text says `(9,2)`. This is a mismatch. Given the visual representation, I should treat the grid as the visual truth unless the text is explicitly correcting it.\n        BUT: The text \"Apples at: (9, 2)\" is explicit. The grid is ASCII art. Usually, the text is the \"source of truth\" for logic, and the grid is just visualization.\n        However, I must assume the grid is accurate to what I can \"see\".\n        Let's check row 0.\n        `0 . . . . . . . A . .`\n        Index 7 is `A`. Prompt says Apple at `(7, 0)`. This matches perfectly (x=7, y=0).\n        Let's check row 1.\n        `1 . . . A . . . . . .`\n        Index 3 is `A`. Prompt says `(3, 1)`. Matches.\n        Let's check row 2.\n        `2 . . . . . . . . A`\n        Index 8 is `A`. Prompt says `(9, 2)`.\n        **Discrepancy:** Grid visual `A` is at index 8 (x=8). Prompt text is `(9, 2)`.\n        **Decision:** In Snake games, we rely on the coordinate list. The prompt explicitly lists `(9, 2)`. I will assume the grid character spacing might be slightly off visually (e.g. lack of space at start of line?), but strictly speaking, `(9, 2)` is the target. However, if I blindly trust the text and move to `(9,2)` but the visual `A` is at `(8,2)`, I might miss it if I rely on visuals.\n        **Strategy:** I will treat the `Apples at` list as the canonical truth. I will treat the `Grid` as a visual aid that might have spacing issues. (Note: The prompt shows `2 . . . . . . . . A` which is 9 characters? No, it's 10 characters plus the row label. Let's count \" . . . . . . . . A\" -> 1 dot, 1 space, etc. No, it's just dots and As. `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `.` `A`. That's 9 characters. Wait, the prompt says \"10x10 board\". Indices 0 to 9.\n        Let's look at the prompt text again.\n        `2 . . . . . . . . A`\n        If these are single characters separated by spaces, it would be `2 [space] . [space] . [space] . [space] . [space] . [space] . [space] . [space] . [space] A`. That would be very wide.\n        Usually, it's `2 . . . . . . . . . A`. That is 11 characters (1 label + 10 board). Let me check the length of the line in the prompt.\n        `2 . . . . . . . . A` - Counting characters (no spaces): 2, ., ., ., ., ., ., ., ., A. That is 9 dots/as. Missing one.\n        Let me recount the visual grid strictly by character position in the text block:\n        `2 . . . . . . . . A` -> The label '2' is at col 0.\n        Then a space.\n        Then a dot (x=0?).\n        Then space.\n        Then dot (x=1?).\n        ...\n        If it's `Label Dot Space Dot Space...`, the last `A` might be `x=9` if there are 10 dots/As.\n        Let's count the items in `2 . . . . . . . . A`.\n        It has 10 items. `2` is the label, then 9 dots/As. Wait, that's 9 cells.\n        Let's look at `9 . . . . . . . . . .` -> It has `9` and then 10 dots. This suggests the others might have lost one for spacing.\n        Let's look at `2 . . . . . . . . A`.\n        If I count the dots:\n        1. .\n        2. .\n        3. .\n        4. .\n        5. .\n        6. .\n        7. .\n        8. .\n        9. A\n        This implies 9 cells. Since the board is 10x10 (0-9), this line is likely missing the first cell or last cell.\n        Given `9 . . . . . . . . . .` has 10 dots, the `2` line is likely misaligned.\n        **Conclusion:** I will rely strictly on the explicit coordinate list in the \"Apples at\" and \"Snake #1 - Head\" lines. The grid is helpful for relative positioning but the exact coordinates must come from the text.\n\n**Analysis:**\nSnake #1 is at `(1, 3)`.\nMy head is at `(0, 6)`.\nDistance is `dx=1`, `dy=-3`. Manhattan distance = 4.\nSnake #1 has 0 apples. I have 0 apples. We are in a race for the first apple.\nIf I go for the closest apple, I should look at the apples on the board.\nApples: `(9, 2), (3, 1), (6, 6), (6, 4), (7, 0)`.\nMy head `(0, 6)`.\nClosest apples:\n1. `(6, 6)`: Distance 6. (Direct East).\n2. `(6, 4)`: Distance 6 + 2 = 8.\n3. `(3, 1)`: Distance 3 + 5 = 8.\n4. `(7, 0)`: Distance 7 + 6 = 13.\n5. `(9, 2)`: Distance 9 + 4 = 13.\n\nThe closest apple for me is `(6, 6)`.\nDistance from Snake #1 at `(1, 3)` to `(6, 6)`:\ndx = 5, dy = 3. Distance = 8.\nDistance from Snake #1 to `(3, 1)`:\ndx = 2, dy = 2. Distance = 4.\nDistance from Snake #1 to `(6, 4)`:\ndx = 5, dy = 1. Distance = 6.\nDistance from Snake #1 to `(9, 2)`:\ndx = 8, dy = 1. Distance = 9.\nDistance from Snake #1 to `(7, 0)`:\ndx = 6, dy = 3. Distance = 9.\n\nSnake #1's closest apple is `(3, 1)` (Distance 4).\nSnake #1 is likely heading towards `(3, 1)` or `(6, 4)`.\n\nMy immediate options from `(0, 6)`:\n- **UP**: `(0, 7)`. Safe. Keeps me in column 0. Moves away from the pack but stays on the edge. Distance to `(6,6)` becomes 7.\n- **DOWN**: `(0, 5)`. Safe. Distance to `(6,6)` becomes 7.\n- **LEFT**: `( -1, 6)`. **DEAD** (Wall).\n- **RIGHT**: `(1, 6)`. Safe. This is the direction towards the apples. Distance to `(6,6)` becomes 5.\n\nSo, UP, DOWN, and RIGHT are safe.\n\nStrategy:\nI need to eat apples to win. The closest apple is `(6, 6)`.\nMoving RIGHT gets me closer.\nSnake #1 is at `(1, 3)`.\nIf I move RIGHT to `(1, 6)`, I am at x=1. Snake #1 is at x=1.\nCurrently: Me (0,6), Enemy (1,3).\nIf I go RIGHT: (1,6). Enemy might go UP (1,4), DOWN (1,2), or stay. If Enemy goes UP, we are not colliding. If Enemy goes DOWN, not colliding. If Enemy goes LEFT (0,3) or RIGHT (2,3), not colliding.\nCollision check:\nMe at (1,6). Enemy at (1,3). Y difference is 3. We are safe from head-on.\nHowever, if Enemy goes UP twice (1,5) and I go RIGHT (1,6), we will be 1 cell apart.\nIn the next turn, Enemy at (1,5) could go UP to (1,6) and I could go RIGHT to (2,6). Collision if we move simultaneously? No, if I am at (1,6) and Enemy at (1,5), then I move to (2,6) and Enemy to (1,6), we swap and survive. If we both move to (1,6), we die.\nHead-on collision only happens if we both attempt to enter the *same* cell *next* turn.\nIf I am at (1,6) and Enemy at (1,5), and I move UP to (1,7) and Enemy moves UP to (1,6), we are safe.\nIf I am at (1,6) and Enemy at (1,5), and I move RIGHT to (2,6) and Enemy moves UP to (1,6), we are safe.\nIf I am at (1,6) and Enemy at (1,5), and I stay? I can't stay.\nThe danger is if I move to (1,6) and Enemy moves to (1,6). Is that possible?\nEnemy is at (1,3). To get to (1,6) in one turn is impossible (needs 3 moves).\nSo moving RIGHT to (1,6) is safe from immediate head-on collision.\n\nWhat about body collisions?\nI have no body. Enemy has no body.\nBoard is empty of obstacles (except walls and apples).\n\nSo, UP, DOWN, RIGHT are all safe.\nWhich is best?\nTarget: (6,6).\nRIGHT moves x from 0 to 1. (Closer).\nUP moves y from 6 to 7. (Further from 6).\nDOWN moves y from 6 to 5. (Further from 6).\nRIGHT is the only move that reduces distance to the closest apple.\n\nWait, let's reconsider Snake #1.\nSnake #1 is at (1, 3).\nIf Snake #1 wants to eat an apple, where will it go?\nApples: (3,1), (6,4), etc.\nIf Snake #1 moves UP to (1, 4), it is closer to (6,4).\nIf Snake #1 moves RIGHT to (2, 3), it is closer to (3,1).\nIf Snake #1 moves DOWN to (1, 2), it is closer to (3,1) or (9,2)? No, (3,1) is closer.\n\nLet's check the \"turn 0\" nature. \"Turn: 0 / 150\".\nUsually, at turn 0, snakes might be small and fast.\nIf I go RIGHT to (1,6), and Snake #1 goes UP to (1,4), we are on the same column (x=1).\nCurrent separation: 3 units (y=6 vs y=3).\nNext separation: 2 units (y=6 vs y=4).\nThis is getting closer.\nIf Snake #1 goes UP again next turn (1,5), separation is 1.\nIf Snake #1 goes UP again (1,6), and I am still at (1,6), we collide if I stay. But I will move.\nIf I am chasing (6,6), I will keep going RIGHT.\nSo I will move RIGHT -> (1,6) -> (2,6) -> (3,6) -> (4,6) -> (5,6) -> (6,6).\nSnake #1 chasing (3,1) or (6,4)?\n(3,1) is close.\nFrom (1,3) to (3,1): Move RIGHT (2,3), then DOWN (2,2)? No, DOWN is y-1. Target is y=1.\n(2,3) -> (3,3) -> (3,2) -> (3,1).\nOr (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (3,2) -> (3,1).\nThere is no conflict between my path to (6,6) (row 6) and Snake #1's path to (3,1) (row 1).\nHowever, if Snake #1 decides to go for (6,4), it might go (1,3)->...->(6,4).\n(6,4) is at y=4. I am at y=6.\nWe are unlikely to collide on the same row for a while.\nAlso, if Snake #1 goes for (3,1), it will likely vacate the upper area.\nIf Snake #1 goes for (6,4), it will be at y=4, I am at y=6.\nIf we race for (6,6) vs (6,4), we are in different columns (1 vs 6) initially.\nI think I am safe to move RIGHT.\n\nIs there any reason to move UP or DOWN?\nMoving UP (0,7) or DOWN (0,5) puts me on the edge (x=0).\nIf I stay on the edge, I am trapped if someone blocks x=1.\nIf I go RIGHT (1,6), I open up the entire right side of the board.\nSo RIGHT is better for \"keeping future options open\".\n\nLet's double check the \"Opponent Head\" location.\nPrompt: \"Snake #1 - Head: (1, 3)\"\nVisual: \"3 . 1 . . . . . . .\"\nLet's verify indices.\nIndex 0: `.` (Space? No, `.`)\nIndex 1: `1`\nIndex 2: `.` ... Index 9: `.`\nSo yes, (1, 3) is confirmed.\n\nPlan:\nMove RIGHT to (1, 6).\nRationale: This moves me towards the closest apple (6,6), maintains access to the central board, and keeps a safe distance from Snake #1 at (1,3).\n\nOne check: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body\".\nI have no body. So no risk.\n\"Moving outside the board\".\nRIGHT from 0 is 1. Inside.\n\"Moving into any snake's body\".\nEnemy body is empty.\nMy body is empty.\nSafe.\n\nMove RIGHT.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thought\": \"I am at (0,6). Snake #1 is at (1,3). Apples are at (6,6), (3,1), etc. Closest apple is (6,6). Moving RIGHT to (1,6) is the best approach. It is safe from collisions and opens up the board. Moving UP or DOWN keeps me on the edge and away from apples. I will move RIGHT.\",\n  \"plan\": \"Head towards (6,6). Keep an eye on Snake #1 at (1,3) who is likely going for (3,1) or (6,4).\"\n}\n```\n\nWait, the instructions say \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\" and \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\nAlso, the prompt says \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\".\nSo I can output the reasoning and plan, then the final word.\n\nFinal check on the board state discrepancy.\nPrompt: \"Apples at: (9, 2)\"\nVisual Grid Row 2: `2 . . . . . . . . A`\nIf we assume `A` is at index 8 (0-indexed), it is (8,2).\nIf we assume `A` is at index 9, it's (9,2).\nGiven the visual representation `2 . . . . . . . .

The apple at (6,6) is closer.\nDistance to (6,6) is 6.\nDistance to (9,2) is 13.\n(6,6) is the target.\n\nThe plan is solid.\n\nOne last consideration: \"Head-on collision\".\nIf I go RIGHT to (1,6).\nIf Snake #1 goes UP to (1,4).\nDistance 2.\nNext turn, I could go RIGHT to (2,6). Enemy could go UP to (1,5).\nDistance 1.\nTurn after, I (3,6), Enemy (1,6). Or I (3,6), Enemy (1,6) is on same y but x diff 2.\nWe are safe as long as we don't try to enter the same cell.\nIf I am chasing (6,6) and Enemy is chasing (3,1), we diverge.\nIf Enemy chases (6,4), we might cross at y=4 vs y=6.\nSafe.\n\nWait, what if I go DOWN to (0,5)?\nI stay on the edge.\nIf I go UP to (0,7)?\nEdge.\nRIGHT is the only move into the \"interior\".\nInterior moves are generally safer because you don't get pinned against a wall.\nSo RIGHT is the best choice.\n\nFinal check on \"Your last move information\".\n\"None\".\nThis is turn 0. So no previous moves.\n\nI will output the reasoning and the move.\n\nThe prompt asks for \"Exactly one word\" at the end.\nSo I will write the reasoning, then `RIGHT`.\n\nOne detail: The prompt says \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n\"Decreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\"\nThis is standard.\n\nMy position: (0, 6).\nApple (6, 6): Same Y. Need to increase X.\nSo RIGHT is definitely the direction to the apple.\n\nEnemy at (1, 3).\nIf Enemy wants to go to (3, 1):\nEnemy needs to go Right (X+1) and Down (Y-1).\nIf Enemy wants to go to (6, 6):\nEnemy needs to go Right (X+1) and Up (Y+1).\nIf Enemy goes Right (2,3) and I go Right (1,6), no collision.\nIf Enemy goes Up (1,4) and I go Right (1,6), no collision.\n\nWhat if Enemy goes Left?\nTo (0,3).\nI am at (0,6).\nIf I go Right (1,6), distance is (1,3).\nIf I go Up (0,7), distance is (0,4).\nIf I go Down (0,5), distance is (0,2).\nIf Enemy goes Left to (0,3), and I stay in column 0 (Up/Down), I get closer to Enemy.\nIf I move Right, I move away from Enemy (if Enemy is at 0,3).\nSo moving Right increases distance if Enemy moves Left.\nMoving Right is good for avoiding the enemy.\n\nMoving Right is good for reaching the apple.\nMoving Right is good for avoiding the enemy.\nMoving Right opens up the board.\nSo RIGHT is the move.\n\nLet's write the output.\nI need to include the \"long-term plan or strategy note\" as \"last rationale on the next turn\".\nThe prompt says \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns. This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo I should put a plan in the output.\nThe prompt says \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nSo:\n1. Reasoning (Optional, but I should explain).\n2. Plan (The \"rationale\" for next turn).\n3. Final Move (One word).\n\nI will structure it as:\n[Reasoning text]\n[Plan text]\nRIGHT\n\nWait, the prompt says \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\" AND \"You may also write a short long-term plan...\".\nSo I can do both.\n\nOne constraint: \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Do not add anything after that word, and do not mention future directions after it.\"\nSo the last line must be just `RIGHT`.\n\nI'll combine the reasoning and plan into a coherent thought process.\nThe \"Plan\" is what will be shown next turn as \"Last Rationale\".\nSo I should label it or make it clear.\nActually, usually in these simulations, the user just wants the thought process and the move.\nThe prompt says \"This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo I should probably just write it naturally.\nI will write a concise reasoning and plan, then the move.\n\nDouble check on the apple at (6,4).\nDistance from (0,6) to (6,4) is |6-0| + |6-4| = 6 + 2 = 8.\n(6,6) is distance 6.\nSo (6,6) is closer.\n(3,1) is 3+5=8.\nSo (6,6) is the closest.\n\nWhat if I am tracking (6,6) and Snake #1 is tracking (3,1)?\nWe are on different sides of the board.\nI am at x=0, y=6. Snake at x=1, y=3.\nApple (6,6) is at x=6, y=6.\nApple (3,1) is at x=3, y=1.\nWe are moving roughly away from each other.\nThis is a safe start.\n\nOne small risk: \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies\".\nI have no body. So I am safe from this.\nHowever, if I eat an apple this turn, I will grow a tail at my current position (0,6) at the end of the turn.\nSo next turn, if I am at (1,6) with body at (0,6), and Enemy is at (0,6), Enemy dies.\nBut Enemy is at (1,3). To get to (0,6) is 3 moves (Left, Up, Up). Not possible in one turn.\nSo safe.\n\nConclusion: Move RIGHT.\n\n```text\nI am at (0,6). The closest apple is at (6,6), which is directly to the east. Moving RIGHT is the optimal choice to approach this apple. It also moves me away from the enemy snake at (1,3) if they move left, and keeps me safe from being pinned against the left wall. I will avoid moving UP or DOWN to stay on the optimal path to the central apples.\nPlan: Secure the apple at (6,6) and avoid the enemy at (1,3).\n```\nThen the final word `RIGHT`.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Do not mention future directions after it.\" referring to the final move word.\nI will ensure `RIGHT` is the very last word.\nThe plan text \"Secure the apple at (6,6)...\" mentions (6,6) which is a coordinate, not a direction like UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT. This should be fine.\n\"Future directions\" implies `UP`, `DOWN`, etc.\n\nLet's verify the grid once more for any obstacles.\nRow 6: `6 0 . . . . . A . . .`\nThis confirms Apple at (6,6).\nRow 4: `4 . . . . . . A . . .` -> (6,4).\nRow 2: `2 . . . . . . . . A` -> (8,2) or (9,2). Let's assume (9,2) as per text.\nRow 3: `3 . 1 . . . . . . . .` -> Snake at (1,3).\nRow 1: `1 . . . A . . . . . .` -> (3,1).\nRow 0: `0 . . . . . . . A . .` -> (7,0).\n\nNo obstacles in the immediate path (0,6) -> (1,6).\nI am good to go.\n\nOne final check on the \"0 . . . . . . . A . .\" formatting.\nIf it is `0 . . . . . . . A . .`, let's count the dots.\n1. .\n2. .\n3. .\n4. .\n5. .\n6. .\n7. . (Wait, 7 dots?)\nLet's count characters in `0 . . . . . . . A . .`\n`0` (Label)\n` ` (Space)\n`.` (0)\n` ` (Space)\n`.` (1)\n` ` (Space)\n`.` (2)\n` ` (Space)\n`.` (3)\n` ` (Space)\n`.` (4)\n` ` (Space)\n`.` (5)\n` ` (Space)\n`.` (6)\n` ` (Space)\n`A` (7)\n` ` (Space)\n`.` (8)\n` ` (Space)\n`.` (9)\nYes, this is 10 cells (0-9). Index 7 is A.\nSo (7,0) is correct.\nRow 6: `6 0 . . . . . A . . .`\nLabel `6`.\nSpace.\n`0` (0).\nSpace.\n`.` (1).\n...\nLet's count: `0 . . . . . A . . .`\nItems: `0`, `.`, `.`, `.`, `.`, `.`, `A`, `.`, `.`.\nThat's 9 items? `0` is the head.\nSo:\nx=0: 0 (Head)\nx=1: .\nx=2: .\nx=3: .\nx=4: .\nx=5: .\nx=6: A\nx=7: .\nx=8: .\nx=9: .\nYes, Apple at (6,6) is confirmed.\nEnemy at (1,3) is confirmed.\n\nReady.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"move\": \"RIGHT\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"I am at (0,6). The closest apple is at (6,6), which requires moving East (RIGHT).

UP or DOWN would increase the distance to the nearest apple.\",\n  \"plan\": \"Continue moving towards the apple at (6,6). Monitor the enemy snake at (1,3) to avoid future collisions.\"\n}\n```\nWait, the output format is just text, not JSON. The prompt didn't ask for JSON. Just text.\nI will output the reasoning, plan, and then the word.\n\nActually, the prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\nI will write the reasoning/plan, then a newline, then `RIGHT`.\n\nWait, the prompt says \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\".\nSo I can write:\n\"Reasoning: ... Plan: ... RIGHT\"\nBut that makes the last line `RIGHT` followed by nothing.\n\nLet's refine the text.\n\"Moving RIGHT puts me closer to the apple at (6,6) and away from the enemy. This is the safest and most effective move. Plan: Navigate to (6,6) while watching the enemy at (1,3).\"\nThen `RIGHT`.\n\nWait, \"Do not mention future directions after it.\" refers to the final line. The final line is just `RIGHT`. The line before can contain coordinates and plans. \"Future directions\" likely means \"UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT\".\nI won't use those words in the plan if possible, just to be safe.\n\nFinal check: Are there any apples closer than (6,6)?\n(3,1) is 8 distance.\n(6,4) is 8 distance.\n(6,6) is 6 distance.\n(7,0) is 13.\n(9,2) is 13.\nYes.\n\nIs there any reason to go for (6,4) instead? It's further.\nIs there any reason to go for (3,1)? It's further.\nIs there any reason to go for (7,0)? It's much further.\n\nSo RIGHT is correct.\n\nOne edge case: \"If all snakes die... snake with more apples wins.\"\nWe both have 0 apples. If we both die, it's a draw.\nSo we must survive.\nSurvival is priority 1.\nRight is safe.\n\nOkay, generating output.\n\n```text\nI am at (0,6). The closest apple is at (6,6). To reach it, I must move East (Right). Moving Right also keeps me safe from the left wall and maintains distance from the enemy snake at (1,3). The enemy is far enough away that a head-on collision is not an immediate risk for this turn. Moving Up or Down would be suboptimal as it delays reaching the apples and keeps me pinned against the wall.\nPlan: Secure the apple at (6,6) and avoid trapping myself.\nRIGHT\n```\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nThis implies the plan is part of the text *before* the final line.\nSo:\n[Text including reasoning and plan]\n[Final Move Line]\n\nCorrect.\n\nFinal check on the \"Last Rationale\" instruction.\n\"This plan will be shown back to you as your last rationale on the next turn.\"\nSo I should write the plan in a way that makes sense as a \"Rationale\".\nUsually, Rationales are short summaries of intent.\n\"Secure the apple at (6,6)\" is good.\n\nOne small detail: The board size is 10x10. Range 0-9.\nMy head (0,6).\nIf I go RIGHT, (1,6). Safe.\n\nI'll proceed.\n\nOne thought on the enemy: Snake #1 at (1,3).\nIf the enemy is smart, they might also go for (6,6).\nDistance 11 for them vs 6 for me.\nIf they go for (6,6), they have to cross my path potentially.\nBut I am faster (closer).\nIf I get there first and eat it, I grow. Then I might block them or eat more.\nBut let's not overthink turn 0.\nJust move RIGHT.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves UP?\n(1,4).\nI am at (1,6).\nDistance 2.\nIf I go RIGHT again (2,6), distance stays 2 (Y diff 2).\nIf I go UP (1,7), distance becomes 3.\nIf I go DOWN (1,5), distance becomes 1. Dangerous.\nSo if I move RIGHT this turn, I should prefer RIGHT or UP next turn, not DOWN.\nI will note this in my mental state, but the prompt only asks for the immediate move.\nMy plan \"Secure the apple at (6,6)\" implies I will continue Right.\n\nIs there any trap?\nIf I go RIGHT to (1,6), and Enemy goes UP to (1,4).\nThen I go RIGHT to (2,6), Enemy goes UP to (1,5).\nThen I go RIGHT to (3,6), Enemy goes UP to (1,6).\nWait, Enemy at (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (1,5) -> (1,6).\nIt takes 3 turns for enemy to reach (1,6).\nI am at (1,6) -> (2,6) -> (3,6).\nSo by the time Enemy reaches (1,6), I am at (3,6). Safe.\n\nWhat if Enemy goes for (3,1)?\nEnemy: (1,3) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (3,1).\nI am at (1,6) -> (2,6) -> ...\nWe are diverging.\nSo safe.\n\nRIGHT is definitely the move.\n\n```text\nI am at (0,6) and the closest apple is at (6,6). Moving RIGHT is the only direction that reduces the distance to this apple.

I will continue moving towards the center.\nPlan: Navigate towards the apple at (6,6) while maintaining escape routes.\nRIGHT\n```\n\nWait, I should not say \"RIGHT\" in the plan text, to be safe with the \"Do not mention future directions\" rule.\n\"Navigate towards the apple\" is fine.\n\"Maintaining escape routes\" is fine.\n\nFinal check on the \"Rules\":\n\"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies\".\nI have no body.\n\"If two snake heads move into the same cell on the same turn, both snakes die\".\nEnemy is at (1,3).

Good density.\n\"Snake with more apples wins\".\nSo eating is critical.\n\nMy decision is made.\n\n```text\nI am at (0,6). The closest apple is at (6,6), which is directly to the East. Moving RIGHT is the optimal move to approach this apple and avoid the left wall. The enemy snake at (1,3) is currently far enough away to avoid immediate collision, and moving Right maintains a safe distance.\nPlan: Target the apple at (6,6) and navigate around the enemy.\nRIGHT\n```\n\nWait, I should check the \"Enemy Apples\" again.\n\"Snake #1 apples: 0\".\n\"Your snake apples: 0\".\nSo it's a fair race.\n\nIs there any reason to go DOWN to (0,5) to maybe get (7,0)? No, (6,6) is closer.\nIs there any reason to go UP to (0,7)? No.\nRIGHT is correct.\n\nDouble check the \"Apples at\" list again.\n(9, 2)\n(3, 1)\n(6, 6)\n(6, 4)\n(7, 0)\n\nMy head (0,6).\nApple (6,6) is at y=6.\nApple (6,4) is at y=4.\nApple (3,1) is at y=1.\nApple (7,0) is at y=0.\nApple (9,2) is at y=2.\n\nIf I go RIGHT, I stay at y=6. I am on the same row as the closest apple.\nIf I go DOWN, I leave the row of the closest apple.\nIf I go UP, I leave the row of the closest apple.\nSo RIGHT is the only move that keeps me aligned with the closest apple.\n\nOkay, ready.\n\nOne final check on the \"Turn: 0 / 150\".\nThis is the first move.\nI have no body.\nI must not hit a wall.\nI must not hit the enemy.\nRIGHT from (0,6) -> (1,6).\nEnemy is at (1,3).\nVertical distance 3.\nSafe.\n\nI will output the text and the move.\n\nOne detail: The prompt says \"Do not add anything after that word\".\nSo the last line must be exactly `RIGHT`.\nNo extra spaces. No punctuation.\nJust `RIGHT`.\n\nThe text before it can have anything.\nI will keep the reasoning concise.\n\nOne thought: The visual grid for row 2 shows `A` at the end.\nIf it is (9,2), it is very far.\nIf it is (8,2) (visual), it is (9,2) distance wise anyway.\nThe difference is 1 step. Not critical for turn 0.\n\nFinal Logic:\n1. Identify closest target: (6,6).\n2. Identify direction: East (Right).\n3. Verify safety: No wall, no body, no enemy in target cell.\n4. Verify strategy: Best path, opens up board.\n5. Output.\n\nI will generate the response now.\n\n```text\nI am at (0,6) and the closest apple is at (6,6). To get closer, I need to move East (Right). This move is safe from walls and the enemy at (1,3). It also keeps me on the row with the apple, maximizing efficiency. Moving Up or Down would increase the distance to the nearest apple and keep me pinned against the left wall.\nPlan: Move towards (6,6) and watch for the enemy's path.\nRIGHT\n```\n\nWait, the prompt says \"Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nThe \"Plan\" I wrote is part of the text.\nThe last line is `RIGHT`.\nThis seems correct.\n\nLet's check the \"My last move information\" in the prompt.\nIt is empty/None.\nThis confirms I don't have a tail or previous moves to worry about.\n\nThe prompt says \"Coordinate reminder: decreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\"\nSo I am at x=0. Right is x=1.\nTarget is x=6.\nCorrect.\n\nI'm confident.\n\n```text\nI am at (0,6). The closest apple is at (6,6), which requires moving East (Right). This is the most direct route.

I can just say \"Moving Right\".\n\"Moving Right is the most direct route\".\nThat works.\n\nFinal text generation.\n\n```text\nI am at (0,6) and the closest apple is at (6,6). Moving Right is the only direction that decreases the distance to this apple. This move is safe from walls and the enemy at (1,3), and it keeps my options open.\nPlan: Navigate towards the apple at (6,6) while watching the enemy.\nRIGHT\n```\n\nOne last check. Is there any apple closer if I turn 180 degrees? No.\nIs there any apple closer if I go vertical? No.\nIs the path clear?\nRow 6: `6 0 . . . . . A . . .`\nMoving Right from 0 to 1.

No.\nIs there an apple at (6,6)? Yes.\nSo the path is clear of apples until the target.\nThis means I won't accidentally eat an apple earlier and change my body length, which is fine.\n\nI am ready.\n\n```text\nI am at (0,6). The closest apple is at (6,6). To approach it, I must move RIGHT. This move is safe from walls and the enemy at (1,3).

The board state shows an apple at (6, 8), and there are no obstacles in that cell.\n2.  **Apple Acquisition:** Moving UP places my head directly on an apple. Eating an apple grows my snake, which is essential for scoring and survival.\n3.  **Strategic Positioning:** \n    - After eating at (6, 8), my new tail will be at (6, 6), leaving the body as [(6, 7), (6, 6)] (assuming I don't eat another apple immediately next turn).\n    - This keeps my snake in the upper open area (rows 6-9).\n    - It avoids the lower-left quadrant (rows 0-4) where Enemy Snake #1 is currently located. Since the enemy is at y=0, they cannot threaten my position at y=8 in a single turn.\n4.  **Alternatives:**\n    - *RIGHT (7, 7):* Moves towards the wall (x=9) and potential dead ends in the future. Doesn't get an apple immediately.\n    - *DOWN (6, 6):* Runs into my own body (death).\n    - *LEFT (5, 7):* Safe, but no apple, and moves away from the nearest apple (6, 8).\n    \n**Conclusion:** Moving UP is the only move that guarantees eating an apple immediately while maintaining optimal board positioning and safety.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Eat (6, 8). Turn around (likely RIGHT or DOWN next, depending on where the next target is) to target the apple at (6, 4) or scan for new apples.\n\n**Decision:** UP\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

However, looking at the board state, (6,9) is empty. Wait, the board shows row 9 is . . . . . . . . . . . (nine dots?), but index 9 is valid. Actually, (6,9) is safe from walls.\n    - **DOWN (6, 7):** Runs into my own body. I died in turn 7 because I moved down into (6,7). I must not repeat this.\n    - **RIGHT (7, 8):** Valid.\n    - **LEFT (5, 8):** Valid.\n\n2.  **Strategic Analysis:**\n    - My current head is (6,8). I just ate the apple there.\n    - **Constraint Check:** \"Your last move information... UP... START LAST RATIONALE... Decision: UP\". This implies I successfully moved UP from (6,7) to (6,8) and ate.\n    - **Obstacle:** My tail is currently at (6,6). My body occupies (6,7) and (6,6).\n    - **Threat Analysis:** Enemy is at (6,0). They are far away.\n    - **Apple Targeting:** The apple at (6,4) is directly below me, but I cannot go DOWN. I need to maneuver to reach it. The apple at (3,5) is to the left.\n    - **Board State Reference:** The provided ASCII board shows row 8 as \". . . . . . 0 . . .\" where 0 is at (6,8). The cell to the left (5,8) is a \".\" (empty).\n\n3.  **Decision:**\n    - Moving **LEFT** to (5, 8) is the safest and most flexible move. It moves me away from my tail/body and keeps me in the upper open area. It avoids the \"trap\" of the corner if I went UP or RIGHT (which leads towards the right edge). Moving left allows me to eventually turn down towards (6,4) or (3,5).\n    - I must avoid moving DOWN into (6,7).\n\n**Conclusion:** LEFT is a safe move that opens up future paths without trapping me.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Navigate to the apple at (6,4) or (3,5).\n**Decision:** LEFT\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nLEFT",

I moved LEFT from (6, 8) last turn.\n- **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (7, 0), Body at [(6, 0), (5, 0)]. Located at the bottom right. Distance is significant (~8-9 tiles away).\n- **Apples:**\n    - (9, 2): Far right, reachable but requires navigation.\n    - (6, 4): Directly southeast, 5 units away (Manhattan distance: |5-6| + |8-4| = 1 + 4 = 5).\n    - (0, 0): Bottom left corner.\n    - (3, 5): Middle left, 5 units away (Manhattan distance: |5-3| + |8-5| = 2 + 3 = 5).\n    - (6, 9): Top center. (Wait, in the previous turn summary it said A was at (6,9), but looking at the board map: row 9 is `A` at column 6. Actually, the board map in the prompt shows `A` at (6,9) in row 9. Let's verify: `9 . . . . . . A . . .` -> index 6 is A. So (6,9) is an apple.)\n- **Turn:** 9 / 150.\n\n**Reasoning for Move UP to (5, 9):**\n1.  **Immediate Survival:**\n    - **UP (5, 9):** Valid. Wall check: max y is 9, so (5,9) is on the boundary. Safe.\n    - **DOWN (5, 7):** Valid. My body is at (6,8), (6,7). (5,7) is empty. Safe.\n    - **RIGHT (6, 8):** Valid. My body is at (6,8), but wait. My body *was* at (6,8) last turn. I moved LEFT to (5,8). So my tail is currently at (6,7)? Let's trace.\n        - Old Head: (6,8)\n        - Old Body: [(6,8), (6,7)] -> Wait, the prompt says \"Body: [(6, 8), (6, 7)]\". This usually means the head is the first element, or the list represents the trailing segments. The prompt says: \"All snake coordinate lists are ordered head-to-tail: the first tuple is the head, each subsequent tuple connects to the previous one...\".\n        - My Head is (5,8).\n        - My Body is [(6,8), (6,7)].\n        - So my segments are: Head (5,8) -> Segment 1 (6,8) -> Segment 2 (6,7).\n        - **RIGHT (6,8):** This moves into my own body segment (which is at 6,8). **INVALID/DEADLY.**\n    - **LEFT (4, 8):** Valid. Safe.\n\n2.  **Strategic Analysis:**\n    - **Apple Targeting:**\n        - (6,9): Distance 2. (5,8) -> (5,9) -> (6,9). Needs 2 turns.\n        - (6,4): Distance 5.\n        - (3,5): Distance 5.\n    - **Space Management:**\n        - If I go UP to (5,9), I am in the corner (x=5, y=9). This is a tight space.\n        - However, (6,9) is an apple. If I don't go for it, the enemy might eventually head that way (unlikely given their position), but more importantly, I need to secure points.\n        - If I go DOWN to (5,7), I am in the open but further from the (6,9) apple.\n        - If I go LEFT to (4,8), I drift away from the (6,9) apple.\n    - **Risk of Corner:**\n        - (5,9) is a corner. Moving there restricts my next move options to DOWN or RIGHT (LEFT is out of bounds, UP is out of bounds).\n        - If I move UP to (5,9), my body follows. Currently my tail is at (6,7). Next turn, if I eat (6,9), I grow. If I don't eat, I move. To reach (6,9) from (5,9), I must go RIGHT. Is (6,9) safe? Yes, it's an apple. Is (6,8) safe? Yes, it's empty (I just left it, body moves away).\n        - However, if I go UP, my next turn options are limited. If I go DOWN, I stay flexible.\n        - BUT, the apple (6,9) is there. It's an easy point. And moving UP to (5,9) creates a \"hook\" shape.\n        - Let's look at the board again.\n        - Row 9: `. . . . . . A . . .`\n        - I am at (5,8). Moving UP puts me at (5,9).\n        - Next turn, I can go RIGHT to (6,9) and eat the apple. That grows my snake. My tail will move forward, clearing (6,7).\n        - This seems like a good plan. The corner is dangerous only if I stay there too long or get boxed in. But I have a clear path to an apple.\n        - What about the enemy? They are at (7,0). No threat.\n        - What about other moves?\n        - DOWN to (5,7): This is safe, but puts me further from this apple. It opens up paths to (6,4) and (3,5). But (6,9) is closer.\n        - LEFT to (4,8): Also moves away from (6,9).\n        - RIGHT is death.\n    - **Comparison:**\n        - Target (6,9): 2 turns away. (UP then RIGHT).\n        - Target (6,4): 5 turns away.\n        - Target (3,5): 5 turns away.\n        - Taking the closest apple is generally the best strategy to gain length and speed advantage.\n        - Is there a danger in being at (5,9)? If I go UP, I am at (5,9). The enemy is far. The only immediate threat is if I trap myself. But next turn I plan to go RIGHT to (6,9). From (6,9), I can go DOWN or LEFT.\n        - If I go UP now, I am at (5,9).\n        - If I go DOWN now, I am at (5,7).\n        - Let's check collision with Enemy 1.\n        - Enemy 1 Head: (7,0). Body: (6,0), (5,0).\n        - They are moving. They will likely stay in the bottom right or chase (9,2).\n        - They are no threat to me at (5,9) or (5,7).\n        - **Self-Collision:** If I go UP to (5,9), my body shifts. Old tail (6,7) moves to (6,8)? No, the tail moves forward. The segment at (6,7) becomes (6,8)? No.\n          - Current: Head (5,8), Body [(6,8), (6,7)].\n          - If I move UP: Head moves to (5,9).\n          - The segment that was at (6,8) moves to (5,8) (old head).\n          - The segment that was at (6,7) moves to (6,8).\n          - So next turn body will be [(5,8), (6,8)].\n          - If I then move RIGHT to (6,9) (eating apple), Head (6,9). Body shifts: (5,8) -> (6,8), (6,8) -> (5,8)? No.\n          - If I eat at (6,9): Head becomes (6,9). Old body segments fill in. I grow.\n          - This seems fine.\n    - **Critical Check:** Is moving into a corner (5,9) dangerous?\n      - Usually yes. But if there is an apple at (6,9), it's a \"bait\" corner.\n      - If I don't take it, the apple sits there. It's a free point.\n      - Is there any other snake capable of reaching it? Snake #1 is at (7,0). Manhattan distance is |7-6| + |0-9| = 10. They are 10 turns away. I am 2 turns away.\n      - It's my apple.\n      - So, moving UP is correct to secure it.\n\n3.  **Decision:**\n    - Move **UP** to (5, 9).\n    - This sets up a guaranteed apple eat next turn (RIGHT to (6,9)).\n    - Moving DOWN or LEFT delays getting this apple.\n    - Moving RIGHT is death.\n\n**Long-term Plan:** Secure the apple at (6,9) next turn. Then assess the board for the next target (likely (6,4) or (3,5)).\n**Decision:** UP\n**END RATIONALE**\n\nUP",

The segment in front of my tail is at (6, 8). However, if I move LEFT to (4, 9), I need to calculate where my body ends up. If I move LEFT, my head goes to (4, 9). My body shifts: the segment at (5, 8) moves to (5, 9), and the segment at (6, 8) moves to (5, 8). This results in a body of [(5, 9), (5, 8)]. I am moving into my own body segment at (5, 9), which kills me. Also, (4, 9) is on the board, but moving into my own body immediately is fatal.\n    *   **RIGHT (6, 9):** This is an apple.

The prompt says: \"Moving directly backwards into your own body (into the cell directly behind your head) counts as hitting yourself and you die.\" My head is at (5, 9). My body is (5, 8) -> (6, 8). The cell behind my head is (5, 8). If I move LEFT to (4, 9), I am not moving to (5, 8). I am moving to (4, 9). However, (5, 8) is occupied by my body. If I move to (4, 9), my body moves to fill my old spot (5, 9) and (5, 8). So (4, 9) is empty initially. But if I move there, I will have body segments at (5, 9) and (5, 8).

Wait, checking the prompt text again. \"Head: (5, 9), Body: [(5, 8), (6, 8)]\". Ah. No. The prompt says: \"My Snake (ID 0): Head: (5, 9), Body: [(5, 8), (6, 8)]\". This implies the body list is ordered head-to-tail. So the segment immediately behind the head is (5, 8).\n        *   **LEFT (4, 9):** This move places me at (4, 9). I need to check if (4, 9) is occupied. It is empty on the board. However, if I move LEFT, my body shifts. The segment (5, 8) moves to (5, 9). The segment (6, 8) moves to (5, 8). So my new body is at (5, 9) and (5, 8). My head is at (4, 9). I am not colliding with myself. However, looking at the board map in the prompt:\n            *   Row 9: `. . . . . 0 A . . .` (Current state)\n            *   Wait, the prompt shows \"9 . . . . . 0 A . . .\". This indicates the head '0' is at column 5 (if we count 0..9). Actually, the dots are placeholders. Let's map it:\n                *   Columns 0 to 9.\n                *   \" . . . . . 0 A . . .\" -> Indices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n                *   So 0 is at index 5. Yes, (5, 9).\n            *   My body (5, 8) is at the next line: \"8 . . . . . T T . . .\". T represents body/tail.\n                *   \" . . . . . T T . . .\" -> Indices 5 and 6 are T.\n                *   So (5, 8) and (6, 8) are occupied.\n        *   So, if I move **LEFT** to (4, 9):\n            *   Head: (4, 9).\n            *   Body: (5, 9), (5, 8).\n            *   Is (4, 9) safe? Yes, empty.\n            *   Is moving into (5, 8) backwards? No, I am moving left.\n            *   Is there any other snake?\n            *   Snake #1: (8, 0). Far away.\n            *   Is there an apple at (4, 9)? No.\n            *   Is there an apple at (6, 9)? Yes.\n        *   **RIGHT (6, 9):**\n            *   Head: (6, 9). This is an apple. I eat it. I grow. My tail does not move this turn.\n            *   Next turn state: Head (6, 9). Body: (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8). (Since I grew, the tail stays at (6, 8) this turn, but wait, I grew, so the tail from previous turn (6, 8) remains, and I add a segment? No, growing means the tail does not move for one turn. My current tail is (6, 8).\n            *   Let's trace carefully.\n            *   Current: Head (5, 9). Body: (5, 8), (6, 8).\n            *   Move RIGHT to (6, 9). Eat apple.\n            *   New Head: (6, 9).\n            *   New Body: (5, 9) (old head), (5, 8) (old body 1), (6, 8) (old body 2/tail).\n            *   Length increases by 1.\n            *   Is (6, 9) blocked? No, it's an apple.\n            *   Is there an enemy moving to (6, 9)? No.\n        *   **DOWN (5, 8):**\n            *   Target (5, 8).\n            *   This is currently occupied by my body segment (the one right behind my head).\n            *   Moving into your own body (even if it's not the tail) is fatal.\n            *   **DEADLY.**\n        *   **UP (5, 10):**\n            *   Y=10 is out of bounds (max Y is 9).\n            *   **DEADLY.**\n\n    *   **Summary of valid moves:**\n        *   **LEFT (4, 9):** Valid.\n        *   **RIGHT (6, 9):** Valid (Apple).\n        *   **DOWN (5, 8):** Invalid (Hit self).\n        *   **UP (5, 10):** Invalid (Wall).\n\n    *   **Comparison LEFT vs RIGHT:**\n        *   **RIGHT (6, 9):** Eats an apple immediately. Score +1. Grows snake. Sets head to (6, 9). My body becomes (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8).\n            *   Next turn at (6, 9): Options are LEFT (5, 9), DOWN (6, 8), UP (6, 10 - invalid).\n            *   If I move DOWN to (6, 8), I hit my own body (tail is at 6, 8).

That is death.\n                *   If I move LEFT to (5, 9), I hit my body (segment at 5, 9). That is death.\n                *   So if I eat the apple at (6, 9), I will be trapped (Surrounded by my own body) UNLESS the tail moves away.\n                *   Wait. The tail moves away *if* I don't grow. But if I eat, I grow, so the tail stays.\n                *   Current tail: (6, 8).\n                *   If I eat: Head (6, 9). Body (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8).\n                *   Next turn, if I try to move, I am blocked by my own body in all available directions (except Up, which is wall).\n                *   This is a \"suicide\" move.\n        *   **LEFT (4, 9):** No apple. Moves to (4, 9).\n            *   Next turn state: Head (4, 9). Body: (5, 9), (5, 8).\n            *   Tail moves from (6, 8) to (5, 8).\n            *   Wait, if I don't eat, the tail moves to follow the body.\n            *   Old Body: (5, 8), (6, 8).\n            *   New Head: (4, 9).\n            *   New Body: (5, 9), (5, 8).\n            *   New Tail: The old tail (6, 8) is now detached? No.\n            *   The snake moves. The tail follows the segment in front of it.\n            *   Segments:\n                *   S1: (5, 9) (follows head)\n                *   S2: (5, 8) (follows S1)\n                *   Tail: (6, 8) -> moves to (5, 8). But (5, 8) is now occupied by S2.\n            *   Let's trace the movement step by step.\n            *   Current: Head (5, 9). Body: (5, 8). Tail: (6, 8).\n            *   Move LEFT to (4, 9).\n            *   Head moves to (4, 9).\n            *   The body segment at (5, 8) moves to the old head position (5, 9).\n            *   The tail at (6, 8) moves to the old body position (5, 8).\n            *   Result: Head (4, 9). Body (5, 9). Tail (5, 8).\n            *   So the snake occupies: (4, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8).\n            *   Are these coordinates connected? Yes: (4,9) -> (5,9) (right). (5,9) -> (5,8) (down).\n            *   Is this safe? Yes.\n            *   What are my options next turn from (4, 9)?\n                *   LEFT (3, 9): Empty.\n                *   RIGHT (5, 9): Body (will die).\n                *   UP (4, 10): Wall (die).\n                *   DOWN (4, 8): Empty?\n                *   Let's check the board for (4, 8).\n                *   Board Row 8: `. . . . . T T . . .` -> Indices 0-9. Indices 5 and 6 are T (my old body).\n                *   Wait, if I move LEFT, my body moves.\n                *   My body will be at (5, 9) and (5, 8).\n                *   So (4, 8) is currently empty in the board state? No, the board state is static for this turn.\n                *   But for next turn, my body will occupy (5, 9) and (5, 8).\n                *   So from (4, 9), moving DOWN to (4, 8) is safe (empty).\n                *   Moving LEFT to (3, 9) is safe (empty).\n                *   So LEFT gives me flexibility.\n\n    *   **Re-evaluating RIGHT (6, 9) vs LEFT (4, 9):**\n        *   **RIGHT (6, 9):** I eat the apple.

If I move there, I die (tail moves to 5, 8, head moves to 6, 8 -> collision).\n                *   LEFT: (5, 9) - My body. If I move there, I die.\n                *   RIGHT: (7, 9) - Empty.\n            *   Wait. If I move RIGHT to (6, 9), I eat. The tail does NOT move this turn because I grew.\n            *   So at the start of next turn, my body is (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8).\n            *   If I move RIGHT to (7, 9) next turn:\n                *   Head (7, 9).\n                *   Body shifts: (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8).\n                *   This is valid! I am not hitting myself.\n            *   So moving RIGHT to (6, 9) is safe this turn, and allows me to move RIGHT again next turn to escape the corner.\n            *   However, moving LEFT to (4, 9) also works.\n            *   Why prefer one over the other?\n            *   **RIGHT** gets an apple. +1 Score. Growth.\n            *   **LEFT** gets no apple. No growth.\n            *   Usually, taking the apple is better.

No.\n        *   So I can move to (7, 9) next turn.\n        *   So RIGHT is safe.\n\n    *   **What if I go LEFT?**\n        *   (4, 9). No apple.\n        *   Next turn I can go DOWN (4, 8) or LEFT (3, 9).\n        *   (4, 8) is empty.\n        *   (3, 9) is empty.\n        *   This is the \"safe\" option. But \"safe\" means no risk and no reward.\n        *   The \"risky\" option (RIGHT) has no risk (I verified (7,9) is clear). So it's just Reward.\n        *   Therefore, RIGHT is strictly better.\n\n    *   **Wait, look at the board again.**\n        *   Row 8: `. . . . .

Dead.\n- DOWN: (5, 8) -> Occupied by my body (immediate segment). Dead.\n- LEFT: (4, 9) -> Empty. Safe. No apple.\n- RIGHT: (6, 9) -> Apple. Safe.\n\nIs (6, 9) an apple?\nYes, the board shows \"A\" at (6, 9).\nIs there any reason to avoid (6, 9)?\nIf I move there, I eat it.\nNext turn, I will be at (6, 9). My body will be (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8).\nFrom (6, 9), I can move RIGHT to (7, 9).\n(7, 9) is empty.\nSo the path is clear.\nI will gain an apple.\nThis increases my score and length.\nThis is the best move.\n\nFinal check on the \"Body\" list order.\n\"Body: [(5, 8), (6, 8)]\"\n1. (5, 8) -> connects to Head (5, 9). Correct.\n2. (6, 8) -> connects to (5, 8). Correct.\nSo (6, 8) is the tail.\n\nMoving RIGHT to (6, 9):\nHead moves to (6, 9).\nOld Head (5, 9) becomes segment 1.\nSegment 1 (5, 8) moves to old head (5, 9)? No.\nThe segment at (5, 8) moves to the position of the head (5, 9).\nThe segment at (6, 8) moves to the position of the segment at (5, 8).\nBecause I eat an apple, the tail (6, 8) does NOT move.\nWait.\nIf I eat:\n- Head -> New pos.\n- Every segment shifts forward.\n- Tail stays (because I grew).\nSo:\n- Head: (6, 9)\n- Segment 1 (was at 5, 8) -> (5, 9)\n- Segment 2 (was at 6, 8) -> Stays at (6, 8)? No.\nWait, I am confusing myself.\nStandard Snake Logic:\nSegments: [Head, Segment 1, Segment 2, ..., Tail]\nPositions: (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8)\n\nMove RIGHT (Eat).\nNew Head: (6, 9).\nNew Segments:\n- The old head becomes the new neck (Segment 1): (5, 9).\n- The old neck (Segment 1) becomes the new Segment 2: (5, 8).\n- The old Segment 2 (Tail) becomes new Segment 3: (6, 8).\n- Because I ate, I do NOT delete the tail.\nSo New Body: (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8).\nTotal length: 4.\n\nNext turn, from (6, 9):\n- My body occupies: (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8).\n- If I move RIGHT to (7, 9): Head (7, 9). Body shifts: (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8). Tail (6, 8) moves to (5, 8). Wait.\n  - If I don't eat: Tail moves.\n  - New Head: (7, 9).\n  - Segment 1: (6, 9).\n  - Segment 2: (5, 9).\n  - Tail: (5, 8).\n  - This is valid.\n\nSo the plan holds.\nRIGHT is safe and optimal.\n\nOne last check. Is (7, 9) safe?\nBoard Row 9: ` . . . . . 0 A . . . `\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nSo (7, 9) is empty.\nIs there an enemy?\nNo.\nSo I am good.\n\nWait, looking at the prompt \"Your last move information\":\n\"My Snake (ID 0): Head: (5, 9)\"\nWait.\nThe prompt says:\n\"Your Snake (ID 0):\n  - Head: (5, 9)\n  - Body: [(5, 8), (6, 8)]\"\nSo yes, I am at (5, 9).\n\nWait, the \"Start Last Move Pick\" section says \"UP\".\nAnd the \"Start Last Rationale\" says \"Reasoning for Move UP to (5, 9)\".\nSo in Turn 9, I was at (5, 8) and I moved UP to (5, 9).\nThat matches the current state (Head at 5, 9).\n\nSo the current state is verified.\nMy move is RIGHT.\n\nWhat if I move LEFT?\n(4, 9). No apple.\nNext turn, I can go DOWN to (4, 8).\n(4, 8) is empty.\nFrom (4, 8), I can go DOWN (4, 7), LEFT (3, 8), etc.\nThis is a \"safe\" path.\nBut RIGHT gives an apple.\nIn Snake, you usually take the apple if it doesn't kill you.\nIt doesn't kill me.\nSo RIGHT.\n\nOne edge case: The enemy snake (7, 0). He moves. He is far.\nHe is not a threat.\n\nOkay, I am confident in RIGHT.\n\nWait, I should check if I am moving into a body part of the enemy.\nThe enemy is at (8, 0), (7, 0), (6, 0).\nMy target is (6, 9).\nDistance is huge.\nNo collision.\n\nFinal check on the \"Backwards\" rule.\nIf I move DOWN, I go to (5, 8).\n(5, 8) is my body.\nSo DOWN is death.\nCorrect.\n\nFinal decision: RIGHT.\n\nOne detail.\nThe prompt says: \"If you move onto an apple, you grow by 1 segment and gain 1 point (1 apple).\"\nI will do that.\n\nThe prompt also says: \"If another snake's head moves into any part of your body, that snake dies and your body remains.\"\nThis doesn't apply to me right now, but good to keep in mind.\n\nI will output \"RIGHT\".\n\nWait, is there any chance that the tail (6, 8) is at (6, 8) and I am moving to (6, 9)?\nMy head is at (5, 9).\nMy body is (5, 8).\nMy tail is (6, 8).\nMoving to (6, 9) is not hitting my body.\nMy body is at (5, 8) and (6, 8).\n(6, 9) is empty relative to my body.\nSo I am safe.\n\nI will output \"RIGHT\".\n\nWait, look at the board map again.\nRow 9: `. . . . . 0 A . . .`\nRow 8: `. . . . . T T . . .`\nRow 7: `. . . . . . . . . .`\n\nIf I move RIGHT to (6, 9):\nI eat 'A'.\nMy body becomes (5, 9), (5, 8), (6, 8).\nNext turn, if I move RIGHT to (7, 9):\nI am at (7, 9).\nMy body is (6, 9), (5, 9), (5, 8).\nThis looks safe.\n\nWhat if I move DOWN from (6, 9)? (6, 8).\n(6, 8) is my tail.\nIf I move there, I die.\nSo I must not move DOWN from (6, 9).\nI must move RIGHT.\nThis is a constraint, but a survivable one.\n\nSo, RIGHT is the move.\n\nOne last sanity check.\nIs there any reason to not take the apple?\nNo.\nIs there any reason to take the apple?\nYes, score and length.\nIs it safe?\nYes.\n\nOkay, ready.\n\nWait, I need to write a plan for the next turn in my thinking, but the output must only be the direction.\nThe prompt says: \"You may also write a short long-term plan or strategy note to your future self for the next few turns... Any such plan must appear before your final move line.\"\nSo I should write a plan.\n\"The plan is to move RIGHT to (6, 9) to eat the apple. Next turn, I will likely need to move RIGHT again to (7, 9) to avoid hitting my own body.\"\n\nWait, the prompt says \"The final non-empty line of your response must be exactly one word\".\nSo I can write the plan, then the word.\nBut the example output usually just has the word. Let's stick to the word to be safe, or put the plan in a comment if I was writing code. But this is text.\n\"Your response\" implies the whole block.\nOkay, I will put the plan in the thinking block and the final move as the last line.\n\nWait, the prompt says: \"You may think out loud and explain your reasoning.\" and \"You may also write a short long-term plan...\".\nThis suggests the plan is part of the output text, preceding the final move.\nI will include a plan.\n\nPlan:\nMove RIGHT to (6, 9) to eat the apple. My snake will grow. I will likely need to move RIGHT again on the next turn to (7, 9) to avoid my own body segments. I will then be in the open and look for the next apple, likely (6, 4) or (3, 5).\n\nFinal Move: RIGHT\n\nWait, looking at the \"End of your last move information\" block.\nIt contains the rationale.\nI should follow that style.\nThe rationale for the last move was quite long.\nI should be concise.\n\nMy move is RIGHT.\n\nDouble check coordinates.\n(5, 9) is row 9, column 5.\nRight is (6, 9).\nYes.\n\nWhat if the enemy moves up? No, they are at y=0.\nWhat if the enemy moves right? No, they are at x=8.\nThey are no threat.\n\nI am confident.\n\nOne weird thing. The previous turn rationale said \"Move UP to (5, 9)\". The board state shows Head at (5, 9). This is consistent.\nThe previous turn rationale also said \"LEFT (4, 8): Valid. Safe\". This was valid for the position at (5, 8). Now I am at (5, 9). So the context is correct.\n\nWait, in the previous turn rationale, it said:\n\"RIGHT (6, 8): This moves into my own body segment (which is at 6,8). INVALID/DEADLY.\"\nThis confirms the body parts are where I think they are.\n\nOkay, go.\n\nOne minor thing. If I go RIGHT, I am at (6, 9).\nIs there any scenario where (6, 9) is deadly?\nOnly if I hit something.\nMy body: (5, 8), (6, 8). Not (6, 9).\nEnemy: Far away.\nWall: No.\nApple: Yes.\nSo it's good.\n\nOkay, writing the output.\nI will write the plan, then the move.Move RIGHT to (6, 9) to eat the apple and grow. This sets up a forced move RIGHT to (7, 9) on the next turn to escape the corner, but keeps me on a path to score points while staying safe from the distant enemy.\n\nRIGHT",

Body segments at (6, 9), (5, 9), and (5, 8).\n2.  **Enemy Snake #1:** Head at (9, 1). Body at (9, 0), (8, 0). Note that there is an apple at (9, 2) above the enemy snake. The enemy is likely to move UP towards (9, 2) if it is safe.\n3.  **Move Evaluation:**\n    *   **UP:** Target (7, 10). This is outside the board (y-max is 9). **Invalid.**\n    *   **DOWN:** Target (7, 8). This is currently empty.\n    *   **LEFT:** Target (6, 9). This is occupied by my own body (the segment immediately following the head). Moving here would be moving backwards into myself. **Invalid.**\n    *   **RIGHT:** Target (8, 9). This is currently empty (represented as a dot in the board state row 9).\n\n4.  **Collision Analysis (Simulating next turn):**\n    *   If I move **RIGHT** to (8, 9): Enemy moves. Let's assume enemy moves UP to (9, 2) (eating the apple) or stays. Even if enemy moves LEFT to (8, 1), there is no collision. (8, 9) is safe.\n    *   If I move **DOWN** to (7, 8): Enemy moves. The only potential collision is if the enemy moves UP to (7, 8). The enemy is at (9, 1). To reach (7, 8), the enemy would need to move diagonally or jump, which is impossible. The enemy moves orthogonally. Distance from (9, 1) to (7, 8) is |9-7| + |1-8| = 9 steps. A single move can only reduce distance by 1. So (7, 8) is safe from the enemy. However, moving DOWN (y=8) is moving towards the bottom of the board and potentially trapping myself in the corner (bottom-left is (0,0)). Moving RIGHT (y=9) keeps me at the top edge, maintaining more open space for future turns.\n\n5.  **Strategy:**\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (8, 9) is the optimal move. It maintains maximum maneuverability by keeping me at the top edge. It sets up a potential path towards the apple at (6, 4) or the cluster at (3, 5) in the future without forcing me into a corner.\n    *   I must be careful not to get trapped. Moving DOWN to (7, 8) limits my future upward moves (I'd be blocked by my own body at (7, 9) if I moved there, but actually if I move down I leave (7,9) open... but I'm analyzing the *future* state). The key is that moving RIGHT keeps me facing the open board (x=8, x=9) rather than facing walls or tight spaces.\n\n6.  **Re-evaluation of Enemy Move:**\n    *   Enemy at (9, 1).\n    *   Apple at (9, 2).\n    *   Enemy will likely move UP to (9, 2).\n    *   If Enemy moves UP, it clears (9, 1) and (8, 0) becomes irrelevant for the turn.\n    *   My move to (8, 9) does not conflict with Enemy's likely move to (9, 2).\n\nConclusion: RIGHT is the only safe move that maintains good board position.\n\nBased on the current board state, moving RIGHT to (8, 9) is the optimal choice. Moving DOWN to (7, 8) would bring me closer to the bottom of the board and limit my future options, whereas moving RIGHT keeps me at the top edge where I have more space to maneuver. The enemy snake at (9, 1) is likely to move UP towards the apple at (9, 2), which does not conflict with my move to (8, 9). Moving LEFT is impossible as it would result in a collision with my own body.\n\nRIGHT",

This brings me to 3 apples, still trailing enemy at 3 apples tied\n   - **LEFT to (8, 1)**: Safe but doesn't get an apple.

However, UP to (9, 2) is clearly superior because it collects the apple, bringing me to 3 apples and tying with the enemy. This is the highest-value move available.\n\nThe enemy is stuck on the top edge at (7, 9) and can only move DOWN to (7, 8) or RIGHT to (8, 9). They cannot reach the (9, 2) apple, so there's no competition for this apple.\n\n**Strategy for next few turns:**\nAfter moving UP to (9, 2) and collecting the apple, I should:\n1. Continue UP to (9, 3) to move away from my body and maintain space\n2. Then consider moving LEFT toward the (6, 4) apple or (1, 4) apple, depending on the enemy's position\n3.

This cell is currently empty. This is a valid move.\n    *   **LEFT**: Target (7, 9). This cell is occupied by my own body segment immediately adjacent to the head. **Death.**\n    *   **RIGHT**: Target (9, 9). This cell is currently empty (marked as '.' in the board state, despite the 'T' at (9,0) and (9,1) indicating the enemy's tail). This is a valid move.\n\n3.  **Strategy**:\n    *   Both DOWN and RIGHT are immediately safe.\n    *   Moving RIGHT to (9, 9) keeps me at the top edge of the board, preserving my ability to maneuver horizontally across the top row. This maintains maximum freedom of movement.\n    *   Moving DOWN to (8, 8) moves me toward the center but, if I continue down, risks trapping myself in the lower half of the board where the board is more cluttered with apples and the enemy snake. The top row is currently very clear (mostly empty), so staying high is advantageous.\n    *   I must also consider the enemy snake (ID 1) at (9, 2). There is an apple directly above it at (9, 2)? Wait, the board shows the enemy head at (9, 2) and a body segment at (9, 1). Looking closer at the apples: (9, 2) is listed as an apple, but the board shows a '1' there (enemy head). This implies the enemy is currently *on* the apple or about to eat it. The enemy is at (9, 2) [Head], (9, 1) [Body], (9, 0) [Body]. The apple is at (9, 2). The enemy is occupying the apple cell. The enemy is likely to move UP to (9, 3) to clear the apple or move elsewhere, but they might stay. Regardless, the enemy is far away (distance to (9,9) is large).\n    *   Since I cannot move LEFT, and UP is invalid, the choice is strictly between RIGHT and DOWN. RIGHT offers better spatial awareness for future turns.\n\nLong-term plan: Maintain top-edge position to maximize maneuverability. Approach the apple at (6, 4) from above once safe paths open up. Avoid the bottom-left corner where the enemy tail is.\n\nRIGHT",

They are currently blocked from moving further right or down (unless they eat the apple at (9,0) which requires moving through their own body, so they must move UP or LEFT). They are not an immediate threat to my current position (9,8).\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nI have two valid moves: **DOWN** to (9, 7) and **LEFT** to (8, 8).\n1.  **Moving DOWN to (9, 7):** This keeps me on the right wall. While safe for one turn, it limits my future options and potentially drives me towards the enemy snake (Snake #1) who is active on the right side (y=1-2).\n2.  **Moving LEFT to (8, 8):** This moves me off the wall and into the open interior of the board. This increases my mobility, allowing me to navigate towards the central apples ((6,4), (3,5)) and away from the enemy. This aligns with the \"keep future options open\" principle.\n\n**Decision:**\nMoving **LEFT** to (8, 8) is the superior move. It is safe and opens up the board, allowing me to pivot towards the center or downwards depending on the enemy's next move. Moving down keeps me cornered.\n\nLEFT",

The cell (8, 9) is occupied by my 3rd body segment. Moving here causes immediate death. **INVALID**.\n\n2.  **RIGHT to (9, 8):** My body is currently at [(9, 8), (9, 9), (8, 9)]. The cell (9, 8) is occupied by my 2nd body segment (the neck). Moving here causes immediate death. **INVALID**.\n\n3.  **DOWN to (8, 7):** This cell is empty on the board. No enemy snakes are adjacent. This is a safe move that keeps me away from the enemy in the bottom right and maintains flexibility in the center of the board.\n\n4.  **LEFT to (7, 8):** This cell is empty on the board. This is also a safe move towards the center. However, it brings me slightly closer to the bottom-left apple (0,0) but slightly further from the cluster in the top-right. Given the enemy is in the bottom right (y=2), moving DOWN or maintaining y=8 is safer than moving LEFT which would require me to eventually traverse down through y=7,6,5... where the enemy might be later.\n\nComparing **DOWN** and **LEFT**: Both are geometrically safe. However, **DOWN** keeps me at y=7, maintaining a safer distance from Snake #1 at y=2. **LEFT** brings me to x=7, which is still relatively safe but reduces my maneuvering room slightly on the left wall. However, looking at the apples: (6,4) and (3,5) are accessible from both. The apple at (1,4) is accessible.\n\nWait, looking closely at the board state in the prompt:\n` 8 . . . . . . . . 0 T`\nWait, the prompt shows the board state *before* I make my move, but refers to my head at (8,8) in the text description.\nWait, there is a discrepancy.
